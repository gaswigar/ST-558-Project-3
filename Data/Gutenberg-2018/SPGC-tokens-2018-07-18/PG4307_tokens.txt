of
jubilee

miss
lord
chapter
at
eight
o
clock
on
sunday
morning
arthur
peachey
unlocked
his
front
door
and
quietly
went
forth
he
had
not
ventured
to
ask
that
early
breakfast
should
be
prepared
for
him
enough
that
he
was
leaving
home
for
a
summer
holiday
the
first
he
had
allowed
himself
since
his
marriage
three
years
ago
it
was
a
house
in
de
crespigny
park
unattached
with
basement
and
a
flight
of
steps
to
the
stucco
pillars
at
the
entrance
de
crespigny
park
a
thoroughfare
connecting
grove
lane
camberwell
with
denmark
hill
presents
a
double
row
of
similar
dwellings
its
clean
breadth
with
foliage
of
trees
and
shrubs
in
front
gardens
makes
it
pleasant
to
the
eye
that
finds
pleasure
in
suburban
london
in
point
of
respectability
it
has
claims
only
to
be
appreciated
by
the
ambitious
of
camberwell
each
house
seems
to
remind
its
neighbour
with
all
the
complacence
expressible
in
buff
brick
that
in
this
locality
lodgings
are
to
let
for
an
hour
after
peachey
s
departure
the
silence
of
the
house
was
unbroken
then
a
bedroom
door
opened
and
a
lady
in
a
morning
gown
of
the
fashionable
heliotrope
came
downstairs
she
had
acute
features
eyes
which
seemed
to
indicate
the
concentration
of
her
thoughts
upon
a
difficult
problem
and
cheeks
of
singular
bloom
her
name
was
beatrice
french
her
years
numbered
six
and
twenty
she
entered
the
and
drew
up
the
blind
though
the
furniture
was
less
than
a
year
old
and
by
no
means
of
the
cheapest
description
slovenly
housekeeping
had
dulled
the
brightness
of
every
surface
on
a
chair
lay
a
broken
toy
one
of
those
elaborate
and
costly
playthings
which
serve
no
purpose
but
to
stunt
a
child
s
imagination
though
the
time
was
midsummer
not
a
flower
appeared
among
the
pretentious
ornaments
the
pictures
were
a
strange
medley
autotypes
of
some
artistic
value
hanging
side
by
side
with
hideous
oleographs
framed
in
ponderous
gilding
miss
then
violently
rang
the
bell
when
the
summons
had
been
twice
french
looked
about
her
with
an
expression
of
strong
disgust
repeated
there
appeared
a
young
woman
whose
features
told
of
long
and
placid
slumbers
well
what
does
this
mean
the
cook
doesn
t
feel
well
miss
she
can
t
get
then
get
breakfast
yourself
and
look
sharp
about
beatrice
spoke
with
vehemence
her
cheeks
showed
a
circle
of
richer
hue
around
the
unchanging
rose
the
domestic
made
insolent
reply
and
there
began
a
war
of
words
at
this
moment
another
step
sounded
on
the
stairs
and
as
it
drew
near
a
female
voice
was
raised
in
song
a
penny
in
his
pocket
and
a
penny
in
his
pocket
a
younger
girl
this
of
much
slighter
build
with
a
frisky
gait
a
jaunty
pose
of
the
head
pretty
but
and
a
long
neck
no
chin
to
speak
of
a
low
forehead
with
the
hair
of
flaxen
fluffed
all
over
it
her
dress
was
showy
and
in
a
taste
that
set
the
teeth
on
edge
fanny
french
her
name
what
s
up
another
row
she
asked
entering
the
room
as
the
servant
went
out
i
ve
known
a
good
many
fools
said
beatrice
but
ada
s
the
biggest
i
ve
come
across
is
she
well
i
shouldn
t
wonder
fanny
admitted
impartially
and
with
a
skip
she
took
up
her
song
again
penny
paper
collar
round
his
neck
are
you
going
to
church
this
morning
asked
her
sister
yes
are
you
come
for
a
walk
instead
there
s
something
i
want
to
talk
to
you
won
t
it
do
afterwards
i
ve
got
an
with
lord
fanny
laughed
and
nodded
interrupted
by
the
reappearance
of
the
servant
who
brought
a
tray
and
began
to
lay
the
table
they
crossed
the
hall
to
the
in
s
time
a
sluttish
meal
was
prepared
for
them
and
whilst
they
were
satisfying
their
hunger
the
door
opened
to
admit
peachey
ada
presented
herself
in
a
costume
which
at
any
season
but
high
summer
would
have
been
inconveniently
cool
beneath
a
loose
thin
her
feet
in
felt
slippers
showed
stockingless
her
neck
was
bare
almost
to
the
bosom
and
the
tresses
of
pale
yellow
upon
which
she
especially
prided
herself
lay
raggedly
pinned
together
on
the
top
of
her
flat
head
she
was
about
years
old
but
at
present
looked
more
than
thirty
her
features
resembled
fanny
s
but
had
a
much
less
amiable
expression
and
betokened
if
the
thing
were
possible
an
inferior
intellect
fresh
from
the
morning
basin
her
cheeks
displayed
that
peculiar
colourlessness
which
results
from
the
habitual
use
of
paints
and
powders
her
pale
pink
lips
thin
and
sullen
were
curiously
wrinkled
she
had
eyes
of
slate
colour
with
lids
so
elevated
that
she
always
seemed
to
be
staring
in
silly
wonder
so
you
ve
got
breakfast
have
you
were
her
first
words
in
a
thin
and
rather
nasal
voice
you
may
think
yourselves
you
have
a
cheek
of
your
own
replied
beatrice
whose
place
is
it
to
see
that
we
get
meals
and
what
can
any
one
do
with
servants
like
i
ve
got
retorted
the
married
sister
it
s
your
own
fault
you
should
get
better
and
when
you
ve
got
them
you
should
manage
them
but
that
s
just
what
you
can
t
oh
d
be
a
wonderful
housekeeper
we
know
all
about
that
if
you
re
not
satisfied
you
d
better
find
board
and
lodging
somewhere
else
as
i
ve
told
you
often
enough
you
re
not
likely
to
get
it
as
they
squabbled
for
some
minutes
fanny
looking
on
with
ingenuous
amusement
and
putting
in
a
word
now
for
this
side
now
for
that
and
what
am
i
going
to
have
for
breakfast
demanded
peachey
at
length
surveying
the
table
you
ve
taken
jolly
good
care
of
yourselves
it
seems
to
she
jumped
up
and
rang
the
bell
when
a
minute
s
interval
brought
no
reply
she
rang
again
beatrice
thought
it
probable
that
the
bell
might
be
rung
without
effect
till
all
was
we
ll
see
about
that
answered
her
sister
and
forthwith
invaded
the
lower
parts
of
the
house
thence
presently
her
voice
became
audible
rising
gradually
to
shrillness
with
it
there
blended
the
rougher
accents
of
the
housemaid
now
in
reckless
revolt
beatrice
listened
for
a
minute
or
two
in
the
hall
then
passed
on
into
the
with
a
contemptuous
laugh
fanny
to
whom
the
uproar
seemed
to
bring
a
renewal
of
appetite
cut
herself
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
and
ate
it
as
she
stood
at
the
window
dirty
cat
beast
swine
the
mistress
of
the
house
fairly
beaten
away
by
superior
force
of
vocabulary
reappeared
with
these
and
other
exclamations
her
face
livid
her
foolish
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
fanny
a
sort
of
mother
cary
s
chicken
revelled
in
the
row
and
screamed
her
merriment
it
was
long
before
the
domestic
uproar
wholly
subsided
but
towards
eleven
o
clock
the
sisters
found
themselves
together
in
the
ada
sprawled
limply
on
a
sofa
beatrice
sat
with
legs
crossed
in
the
most
comfortable
chair
and
fanny
twirled
about
on
a
music
stool
the
only
books
in
the
room
were
a
few
which
belonged
to
arthur
peachey
and
novels
of
the
meaner
kind
wherewith
ada
sometimes
beguiled
her
infinite
leisure
but
on
tables
and
chairs
lay
scattered
a
multitude
of
papers
illustrated
weeklies
journals
of
society
cheap
miscellanies
penny
novelettes
and
the
like
at
the
end
of
the
week
when
new
numbers
came
in
ada
peachey
passed
many
hours
upon
her
sofa
reading
instalments
of
a
dozen
serial
stories
paragraphs
relating
to
fashion
sport
the
theatre
answers
to
correspondents
wherein
she
especially
delighted
columns
of
facetiae
and
gossip
about
notorious
people
through
a
great
deal
of
this
matter
beatrice
followed
her
and
read
much
besides
in
which
ada
took
no
interest
she
studied
a
daily
newspaper
with
special
note
of
law
suits
police
intelligence
wills
bankruptcies
and
any
concern
great
or
small
wherein
money
played
a
part
she
understood
the
nature
of
investments
and
liked
to
talk
about
stocks
and
shares
with
her
male
acquaintances
they
were
the
daughters
of
a
camberwell
builder
lately
deceased
to
each
of
them
had
fallen
a
patrimony
just
sufficient
for
their
support
in
elegant
leisure
ada
s
money
united
with
a
small
capital
in
her
husband
s
possession
went
to
purchase
a
share
in
the
business
of
ducker
blunt
manufacturers
of
disinfectants
arthur
peachey
previously
a
clerk
to
the
firm
became
a
junior
partner
with
the
result
that
most
of
the
hard
work
was
thrown
upon
his
shoulders
at
their
marriage
the
happy
pair
first
of
all
established
themselves
in
a
modest
house
near
camberwell
road
two
years
later
growing
prosperity
brought
about
their
removal
to
de
crespigny
park
where
they
had
now
resided
for
some
twelve
months
unlike
their
elder
sister
beatrice
and
fanny
had
learnt
to
support
themselves
beatrice
in
the
postal
service
and
fanny
sweet
blossom
by
mingling
her
fragrance
with
that
of
a
florist
s
shop
in
brixton
but
on
their
father
s
death
both
forsook
their
employment
and
came
to
live
with
peachey
between
them
these
two
were
the
owners
of
which
produced
a
year
they
disbursed
together
a
weekly
sum
of
shillings
for
board
and
lodging
and
spent
or
saved
the
rest
as
their
impulses
dictated
chapter
ada
brooded
over
her
wrongs
beatrice
glanced
over
fanny
after
twirling
awhile
in
maiden
meditation
turned
to
the
piano
and
jingled
a
melody
from
the
she
broke
off
suddenly
and
without
looking
round
addressed
her
companions
you
can
give
the
third
seat
at
the
jubilee
to
somebody
else
i
m
provided
who
are
you
going
with
asked
ada
my
masher
the
girl
replied
with
a
giggle
where
in
the
strand
i
she
resumed
her
jingling
it
was
now
queen
of
my
beatrice
dropping
her
paper
looked
fixedly
at
the
girl
s
profile
with
an
eyelid
droop
which
signified
calculation
how
much
is
he
really
getting
she
inquired
all
at
once
pounds
a
year
where
oh
where
is
my
leetle
dog
gone
does
he
say
asked
peachey
that
his
governor
will
stump
up
they
spoke
a
peculiar
tongue
the
product
of
sham
education
and
mock
refinement
grafted
upon
a
stock
of
robust
vulgarity
one
and
all
would
have
been
moved
to
indignant
surprise
if
accused
of
ignorance
or
defective
breeding
ada
had
frequented
an
establishment
for
young
ladies
up
to
the
close
of
her
seventeenth
year
the
other
two
had
pursued
culture
at
a
still
more
pretentious
institute
until
they
were
eighteen
all
could
play
the
piano
all
declared
and
believed
that
they
knew
beatrice
had
done
political
economy
fanny
had
been
through
inorganic
chemistry
and
botany
the
truth
was
of
course
that
their
minds
characters
propensities
had
remained
absolutely
proof
against
such
educational
influence
as
had
been
brought
to
bear
upon
them
that
they
used
a
finer
accent
than
their
servants
signified
only
that
they
had
grown
up
amid
falsities
and
were
enabled
by
the
help
of
money
to
dwell
instead
of
with
their
spiritual
kindred
below
anticipating
fanny
s
reply
beatrice
observed
with
her
air
of
sagacity
if
you
think
you
re
going
to
get
anything
out
of
an
old
screw
like
lord
you
ll
jolly
soon
find
your
don
t
you
go
and
make
a
fool
of
yourself
fanny
said
peachey
why
he
can
t
be
more
than
is
he
he
s
turned
the
others
laughed
scornfully
can
t
i
have
who
i
like
for
a
masher
cried
fanny
reddening
a
little
who
said
i
was
going
to
marry
him
i
m
in
no
particular
hurry
to
get
married
you
think
everybody
s
like
if
there
was
any
chance
of
old
lord
turning
up
his
toes
said
beatrice
thoughtfully
i
dare
say
he
ll
leave
a
tidy
handful
behind
him
but
then
he
may
live
another
ten
years
or
and
there
s
nancy
exclaimed
ada
won
t
she
get
half
the
plunder
may
be
plenty
even
then
said
beatrice
her
head
aside
the
piano
business
isn
t
a
bad
line
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
leaves
ten
or
fifteen
haven
t
you
got
anything
out
of
horace
asked
ada
of
fanny
what
has
he
told
you
he
doesn
t
know
much
that
s
the
silly
there
you
are
his
father
treats
him
like
a
boy
if
he
talked
about
marrying
he
d
get
a
cuff
on
the
ear
oh
i
know
all
about
old
lord
ada
proceeded
he
s
a
regular
old
tyrant
why
you
ve
only
to
look
at
him
and
he
thinks
no
small
beer
of
himself
either
for
all
he
lives
in
that
grubby
little
house
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
he
thinks
us
beneath
she
stared
at
her
sisters
inviting
their
comment
on
this
state
of
things
i
quite
believe
nancy
does
said
fanny
with
a
point
of
malice
she
s
a
thing
declared
peachey
and
she
gets
worse
as
she
gets
older
i
shall
never
invite
her
again
it
s
three
times
she
has
made
an
excuse
all
lies
of
course
who
will
marry
asked
beatrice
in
a
tone
of
disinterested
speculation
peachey
answered
with
a
sneer
she
s
going
to
the
jubilee
to
pick
up
a
fancy
as
it
happens
objected
fanny
she
isn
t
going
to
the
jubilee
at
all
at
least
she
says
she
isn
t
she
s
above
it
so
her
brother
told
i
know
who
to
marry
her
ada
remarked
with
a
sour
smile
who
is
that
came
from
the
others
mr
with
a
significant
giggle
fanny
glanced
at
the
more
sober
of
her
sisters
she
the
while
touched
her
upper
lip
with
the
point
of
her
tongue
and
looked
towards
the
window
does
he
fanny
asked
of
the
ceiling
he
wants
money
to
float
his
teetotal
drink
said
beatrice
hasn
t
he
been
at
arthur
about
it
not
that
i
know
answered
the
wife
he
tried
to
get
round
me
but
i
a
scream
of
incredulity
from
fanny
and
a
chuckle
from
peachey
covered
the
rest
of
the
sentence
beatrice
gazed
at
them
defiantly
well
idiots
what
s
up
now
oh
there
s
nobody
knows
luckworth
crewe
better
than
i
do
beatrice
pursued
disdainfully
and
i
think
he
knows
pretty
well
he
ll
make
a
fool
of
himself
when
he
marries
i
ve
told
him
so
and
he
as
good
as
said
i
was
right
if
it
wasn
t
for
that
i
should
feel
a
respect
for
him
he
ll
have
money
one
of
these
and
he
ll
marry
nancy
lord
said
ada
tauntingly
not
just
ada
rolled
herself
from
the
sofa
and
stood
yawning
well
i
shall
go
and
dress
what
are
you
people
going
to
do
you
needn
t
expect
any
dinner
i
shall
have
mine
at
a
who
have
you
to
meet
asked
fanny
with
a
grimace
her
sister
disregarded
the
question
yawned
again
and
turned
to
beatrice
who
shall
we
ask
to
take
fan
s
place
on
tuesday
whoever
it
they
ll
have
to
pay
those
seats
are
selling
for
three
guineas
somebody
told
conversation
lingered
about
this
point
for
a
few
minutes
till
peachey
went
upstairs
when
the
door
was
open
a
child
s
crying
could
be
heard
but
it
excited
no
remark
presently
the
other
two
retired
to
make
themselves
ready
for
going
out
fanny
was
the
first
to
reappear
and
whilst
waiting
for
her
sister
she
tapped
out
a
new
melody
on
the
piano
as
they
left
the
house
beatrice
remarked
that
ada
really
meant
to
have
her
dinner
at
gatti
s
or
some
such
place
perhaps
they
had
better
indulge
themselves
in
the
same
way
suppose
you
give
horace
lord
a
hint
that
we
ve
no
dinner
at
home
he
might
take
us
and
stand
fanny
shook
her
head
i
don
t
think
he
could
get
away
the
guv
nor
expects
him
home
to
dinner
on
the
other
laughed
her
contempt
you
see
what
good
is
he
look
here
fan
you
just
wait
a
bit
and
you
ll
do
much
better
than
that
old
lord
would
cut
up
rough
as
soon
as
ever
such
a
thing
was
mentioned
i
know
he
would
there
s
something
i
have
had
in
my
mind
for
a
long
time
suppose
i
could
show
you
a
way
of
making
a
heap
of
money
no
end
of
money
shouldn
t
you
like
it
better
to
live
as
you
pleased
and
be
independent
the
listener
s
face
confessed
curiosity
yet
was
dubious
what
do
you
say
to
going
into
business
with
me
pursued
miss
french
we
ve
only
to
raise
a
little
money
on
the
houses
and
in
a
year
or
two
we
might
be
making
business
what
sort
of
business
suppose
somebody
came
to
you
and
said
pay
me
a
sovereign
and
i
ll
make
you
a
member
of
an
association
that
supplies
fashionable
clothing
at
about
half
the
ordinary
price
wouldn
t
you
jump
at
it
if
i
thought
it
wasn
t
a
swindle
fanny
replied
ingenuously
of
course
but
you
d
be
made
to
see
it
wasn
t
and
suppose
they
went
on
to
say
take
a
share
and
you
shall
have
a
big
interest
on
it
as
well
as
your
dresses
for
next
to
nothing
how
would
you
like
that
can
it
be
done
i
ve
got
a
notion
it
can
and
i
think
i
know
two
or
three
people
who
would
help
to
set
the
thing
going
but
we
must
have
some
capital
to
show
have
you
the
pluck
to
join
in
and
suppose
i
lose
my
money
i
ll
guarantee
you
the
same
income
you
re
getting
now
if
that
will
satisfy
you
i
ve
been
looking
round
and
making
inquiries
and
i
ve
got
to
know
a
bit
about
the
profits
of
big
dressmakers
we
should
start
in
camberwell
or
somewhere
about
there
and
fish
in
all
the
women
who
want
to
do
the
heavy
on
very
little
there
are
thousands
and
thousands
of
them
and
most
of
them
she
lowered
her
voice
know
as
much
about
cut
and
material
as
they
do
about
stockbroking
do
you
twig
people
like
middlemist
and
murch
they
spend
most
likely
thirty
or
forty
pounds
a
year
on
their
things
and
we
could
dress
them
a
good
deal
more
smartly
for
half
the
money
of
course
we
should
make
out
that
a
dress
we
sold
them
for
five
guineas
was
worth
ten
in
the
shops
and
the
real
cost
would
be
two
see
the
thing
is
to
persuade
them
that
they
re
getting
an
article
cheap
and
at
the
same
time
making
money
out
of
other
thus
and
at
much
greater
length
did
miss
french
discourse
to
her
attentive
sister
forgetful
of
the
time
fanny
found
at
length
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
meet
horace
lord
as
he
came
out
of
church
but
it
did
not
distress
her
chapter
nancy
lord
stood
at
the
window
a
hand
grasping
each
side
of
her
waist
her
look
vaguely
directed
upon
the
limetree
opposite
and
the
house
which
it
in
part
concealed
she
was
a
girl
of
three
and
twenty
with
the
complexion
and
the
mould
of
form
which
indicate
whatever
else
habitual
nourishment
on
good
and
plenteous
food
in
her
ripe
lips
and
cheeks
the
current
of
life
ran
warm
she
had
hair
of
a
fine
auburn
and
her
mode
of
wearing
it
in
a
plaited
diadem
answered
the
purpose
of
completing
a
figure
which
without
being
tall
had
some
stateliness
and
promised
more
her
gown
trimmed
with
a
collar
of
lace
left
the
neck
free
the
maiden
cincture
at
her
waist
did
no
violence
to
natural
proportion
this
afternoon
it
was
monday
she
could
not
occupy
or
amuse
herself
in
any
of
the
familiar
ways
perhaps
the
atmosphere
of
national
jubilee
had
a
disturbing
effect
upon
her
in
spite
of
her
professed
disregard
for
the
gathering
tumult
of
popular
enthusiasm
she
had
not
left
home
and
the
brilliant
weather
did
not
tempt
her
forth
on
the
table
lay
a
new
volume
from
the
circulating
library
something
about
evolution
but
she
had
no
mind
to
read
it
it
would
have
made
her
too
conscious
of
the
insincerity
with
which
she
approached
such
profound
subjects
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
more
she
had
stood
at
the
window
regarding
a
prospect
now
as
always
utterly
wearisome
and
depressing
to
her
grove
lane
is
a
long
acclivity
which
starts
from
camberwell
suburban
dwellings
the
houses
vary
considerably
in
size
and
green
and
after
passing
a
few
mean
shops
becomes
a
road
of
aspect
also
in
date
with
the
result
of
a
certain
picturesqueness
enhanced
by
the
growth
of
fine
trees
on
either
side
architectural
grace
can
nowhere
be
discovered
but
the
of
today
has
not
yet
been
permitted
to
work
his
will
age
and
irregularity
even
though
the
edifices
be
but
so
many
illustrations
of
the
ungainly
the
insipid
and
the
frankly
hideous
have
a
pleasanter
effect
than
that
of
new
streets
built
to
one
pattern
by
the
mile
there
are
small
cottages
overgrown
with
creepers
relics
of
camberwell
s
rusticity
rows
of
tall
and
of
squat
dwellings
that
lie
behind
grassy
plots
railed
from
the
road
larger
houses
that
stand
in
their
own
gardens
hidden
by
walls
narrow
passages
connect
the
lane
with
its
more
formal
neighbour
camberwell
grove
on
the
other
side
are
ways
leading
towards
denmark
hill
quiet
leafy
from
the
top
of
the
lane
where
champion
hill
enjoys
an
aristocratic
seclusion
is
obtainable
a
glimpse
of
open
fields
and
of
a
wooded
horizon
southward
it
is
a
neighbourhood
in
decay
a
bit
of
london
which
does
not
keep
pace
with
the
times
and
nancy
hated
it
she
would
have
preferred
to
live
even
in
a
poor
and
grimy
street
which
neighboured
the
main
track
of
business
and
pleasure
here
she
had
spent
as
much
of
her
life
as
she
remembered
from
the
end
of
her
third
year
lord
never
willingly
talked
of
days
gone
by
but
by
questioning
him
she
had
learnt
that
her
birthplace
was
a
vaguely
indicated
part
of
northern
london
there
it
seemed
her
mother
had
died
a
year
or
so
after
the
birth
of
her
brother
horace
the
relatives
of
whom
she
knew
were
all
on
her
father
s
side
and
lived
scattered
about
england
when
she
sought
information
concerning
her
mother
lord
became
evasive
and
presently
silent
she
had
seen
no
portrait
of
the
dead
parent
of
late
years
this
obscure
point
of
the
family
history
had
often
occupied
her
thoughts
nancy
deemed
herself
a
highly
educated
young
woman
cultured
was
the
word
she
would
have
used
her
studies
at
a
which
was
reputed
modern
terminated
only
when
she
herself
chose
to
withdraw
in
her
eighteenth
year
and
since
then
she
had
pursued
courses
of
independent
reading
had
attended
lectures
had
thought
of
preparing
for
examinations
only
thought
of
it
her
father
never
suggested
that
she
should
use
these
acquirements
for
the
earning
of
money
little
as
she
knew
of
his
affairs
it
was
obviously
to
be
taken
for
granted
that
he
could
ensure
her
independence
satisfactory
this
but
latterly
it
had
become
a
question
with
her
how
the
independence
was
to
be
used
and
no
intelligible
aim
as
yet
presented
itself
to
her
roving
mind
all
she
knew
was
that
she
wished
to
live
and
not
merely
to
vegetate
now
there
are
so
many
ways
of
living
and
nancy
felt
no
distinct
vocation
for
any
one
of
them
she
was
haunted
by
an
uneasy
sense
of
doubtfulness
as
to
her
social
position
lord
followed
the
calling
of
a
dealer
in
pianos
a
respectable
business
to
be
sure
but
it
appeared
not
lucrative
enough
to
put
her
above
caring
how
his
money
was
made
she
knew
that
one
s
father
may
be
anything
whatever
yet
suffer
no
social
disability
provided
he
reap
profit
enough
from
the
pursuit
but
stephen
lord
whilst
resorting
daily
to
his
warehouse
in
camberwell
road
not
a
locality
that
one
would
care
to
talk
about
in
cultured
circles
continued
after
twenty
years
to
occupy
this
small
and
ugly
dwelling
in
grove
lane
possibly
owing
to
an
imperfect
education
he
failed
to
appreciate
his
daughter
s
needs
and
saw
no
reason
why
she
should
not
be
happy
in
the
old
surroundings
on
the
other
hand
perhaps
he
cared
very
little
about
her
undoubtedly
his
favourite
was
horace
and
in
horace
he
had
suffered
a
disappointment
the
boy
in
spite
of
good
schooling
had
proved
unequal
to
his
father
s
hope
that
he
would
choose
some
professional
career
by
preference
the
law
he
idled
away
his
schooldays
failed
at
examinations
and
ultimately
had
to
be
sent
into
mr
lord
obtained
a
place
for
him
in
a
large
shipping
agency
but
it
still
seemed
doubtful
whether
he
would
make
any
progress
there
notwithstanding
the
advantage
of
his
start
at
he
was
remunerated
with
a
mere
thirty
shillings
a
week
a
nominal
salary
his
employers
called
it
nancy
often
felt
angry
with
her
brother
for
his
lack
of
energy
and
ambition
he
might
so
easily
she
thought
have
helped
to
establish
by
his
professional
dignity
her
own
social
status
at
the
level
she
desired
there
came
into
view
a
familiar
figure
crossing
from
the
other
side
of
the
way
nancy
started
waved
her
hand
and
went
to
open
the
door
her
look
had
wholly
altered
she
was
bright
mirthful
overflowing
with
affectionate
welcome
this
friend
of
hers
jessica
morgan
by
name
had
few
personal
attractions
she
looked
overwrought
and
a
very
plain
and
summer
gown
exhibited
her
meagre
frame
with
undue
frankness
her
face
might
have
been
pretty
if
health
had
filled
and
coloured
the
flesh
but
as
it
was
she
looked
a
ghost
of
girlhood
a
dolorous
image
of
frustrate
sex
in
her
hand
she
carried
several
volumes
and
notebooks
i
m
so
glad
you
re
in
was
her
first
utterance
between
pants
after
hasty
walking
and
the
jerks
of
a
nervous
little
laugh
i
want
to
ask
you
something
about
geometrical
progression
you
remember
that
formula
how
can
i
remember
what
i
never
knew
exclaimed
nancy
i
always
hated
those
formulas
i
couldn
t
learn
them
to
save
my
oh
that
s
nonsense
you
were
much
better
at
mathematics
than
i
was
do
just
look
at
what
i
she
threw
her
books
down
upon
a
chair
and
opened
some
pages
of
scrawled
manuscript
talking
hurriedly
in
a
thin
falsetto
her
family
a
large
one
had
fallen
of
late
years
from
a
position
of
moderate
comfort
into
sheer
struggle
for
subsistence
jessica
armed
with
certificates
of
examinational
prowess
got
work
as
a
visiting
governess
at
the
same
time
she
nourished
ambitions
discernible
perhaps
in
the
singular
light
of
her
eyes
and
a
something
of
hysteric
determination
about
her
lips
her
aim
at
present
was
to
become
a
graduate
of
london
university
she
was
toiling
in
her
leisure
hours
the
hours
of
exhaustion
that
is
to
say
to
prepare
herself
for
matriculation
which
she
hoped
to
achieve
in
the
coming
winter
of
her
intimate
acquaintances
only
one
could
lay
claim
to
intellectual
superiority
and
even
she
nancy
lord
to
wit
shrank
from
the
ordeals
of
burlington
house
to
become
to
have
her
name
in
the
newspapers
to
be
regarded
as
one
of
the
clever
the
uncommon
women
for
this
jessica
was
willing
to
labour
early
and
late
regardless
of
failing
health
regardless
even
of
ruined
complexion
and
hair
that
grew
thin
beneath
the
comb
she
talked
only
of
the
exam
of
her
chances
in
this
or
that
paper
of
the
likelihood
that
this
or
the
other
question
would
be
her
brain
was
becoming
a
mere
receptacle
for
dates
and
definitions
vocabularies
and
rules
syntactic
for
essence
of
history
ragged
scraps
of
science
quotations
at
fifth
hand
and
all
the
heterogeneous
rubbish
of
a
crammer
s
shop
when
away
from
her
books
she
carried
scraps
of
paper
with
jottings
to
be
committed
to
memory
beside
her
plate
at
meals
lay
formulae
and
tabulations
she
went
to
bed
with
a
manual
and
got
up
with
a
compendium
nancy
whose
pursuit
of
culture
followed
a
less
exhausting
track
regarded
the
girl
with
a
little
envy
and
some
compassion
esteeming
herself
in
every
respect
jessica
s
superior
she
could
not
help
a
slight
condescension
in
the
tone
she
used
to
her
yet
their
friendship
had
much
sincerity
on
both
sides
and
each
was
the
other
s
only
confidante
as
soon
as
the
mathematical
difficulty
could
be
set
aside
nancy
began
to
speak
of
her
private
troubles
the
prophet
was
here
last
night
she
said
with
a
girlish
grimace
he
s
beginning
again
i
can
see
it
coming
i
shall
have
to
snub
him
awfully
next
oh
what
a
worry
he
is
yes
but
there
s
something
worse
i
suspected
that
the
pasha
knew
of
it
now
i
feel
sure
he
s
encouraging
by
this
oriental
style
nancy
signified
her
father
the
prophet
was
her
father
s
partner
in
business
samuel
bennett
barmby
i
feel
sure
now
that
they
talked
it
over
when
the
prophet
was
taken
into
partnership
i
was
thrown
in
as
a
but
how
could
your
father
possibly
think
it
s
hard
to
say
what
he
think
about
me
i
m
afraid
i
shall
have
to
have
a
talk
with
him
if
so
it
will
be
a
long
talk
and
a
very
serious
talk
but
he
isn
t
well
just
now
and
i
must
put
it
he
isn
t
well
a
touch
of
gout
he
says
two
days
last
week
he
didn
t
go
to
business
and
his
temper
was
nancy
had
a
habit
of
facetiously
quoting
vulgarities
this
from
an
acquaintance
of
theirs
who
often
supplied
them
with
mirth
i
suppose
the
gout
does
make
one
has
he
been
coming
often
mr
barmby
i
pretty
well
i
think
i
must
turn
matchmaker
and
get
him
married
to
some
one
it
oughtn
t
to
be
difficult
the
prophet
has
i
dare
say
some
people
would
think
him
handsome
assented
miss
morgan
nibbling
a
finger
which
showed
an
and
laughing
shyly
and
his
powers
of
conversation
don
t
you
know
any
one
that
would
do
for
him
they
jested
on
this
theme
until
nancy
chose
to
become
serious
again
have
you
any
lessons
no
thank
goodness
every
one
is
going
to
see
the
procession
or
the
decorations
or
the
illuminations
and
all
the
rest
of
the
nonsense
jessica
replied
i
shall
have
a
good
long
day
of
work
except
that
i
ve
promised
to
go
in
the
afternoon
and
have
tea
with
the
little
girls
at
champion
hill
i
wish
you
d
come
too
they
d
be
delighted
to
see
you
and
there
ll
be
nobody
except
the
nancy
looked
up
in
doubt
are
you
sure
won
t
the
dowager
be
at
home
she
hasn
t
left
her
room
for
three
they
exchanged
a
look
of
some
special
significance
then
i
suppose
said
nancy
with
a
peculiar
smile
that
s
why
mr
tarrant
has
been
calling
has
he
how
do
you
know
again
they
looked
at
each
other
and
nancy
laughed
i
have
happened
to
meet
him
twice
the
last
few
she
spoke
in
an
way
the
first
time
it
was
just
at
the
top
of
the
lane
he
was
coming
away
the
second
time
i
was
walking
along
champion
hill
and
he
came
up
behind
me
going
to
the
did
he
talk
nancy
gave
a
nod
yes
both
times
but
he
didn
t
tell
me
that
the
dowager
was
high
and
mighty
asked
jessica
not
quite
so
majestic
as
usual
i
thought
i
didn
t
feel
quite
so
much
of
a
shrimp
before
him
and
decidedly
he
was
in
better
spirits
perhaps
the
dowager
s
death
would
be
important
to
him
very
likely
will
you
come
miss
lord
hesitated
then
with
a
sudden
frankness
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
m
afraid
he
might
be
oh
i
don
t
think
so
not
on
jubilee
but
that
s
the
very
reason
he
may
come
to
be
out
of
the
i
meant
he
was
more
likely
to
be
out
of
town
nancy
still
leaning
over
the
table
propped
her
chin
on
her
hands
and
reflected
where
does
he
go
i
wonder
oh
all
sorts
of
places
no
doubt
men
of
that
kind
are
always
travelling
i
suppose
he
goes
shooting
and
fishing
nancy
s
laugh
made
an
interruption
no
no
he
doesn
t
he
told
me
once
that
he
didn
t
care
for
that
sort
of
oh
well
you
know
much
more
about
him
than
i
do
said
miss
morgan
with
a
smile
i
ve
often
meant
to
ask
you
have
they
anything
to
do
with
tarrant
s
jessica
declared
that
she
had
never
heard
of
it
never
heard
of
it
nonsense
a
few
years
ago
it
used
to
be
posted
up
everywhere
and
i
see
it
sometimes
even
now
but
other
kinds
seem
to
have
driven
it
out
of
the
market
now
that
s
just
like
you
pray
did
you
ever
hear
of
pears
soap
of
really
oh
there
s
hope
of
you
you
ll
be
a
woman
of
the
world
some
don
t
tease
nancy
and
what
would
it
matter
if
he
there
oh
i
don
t
know
but
i
shouldn
t
particularly
like
his
lordship
to
imagine
that
i
went
in
the
hope
of
paying
my
respects
to
him
and
having
the
reward
of
a
gracious
one
can
t
always
be
thinking
about
what
other
people
think
said
jessica
impatiently
you
re
too
sensitive
any
one
else
in
your
position
would
have
lots
of
such
in
my
position
what
my
position
culture
is
everything
observed
miss
morgan
with
the
air
of
one
who
feels
herself
abundantly
possessed
of
that
qualification
but
nancy
laughed
you
may
depend
upon
it
tarrant
doesn
t
think
he
calls
himself
a
and
talks
like
one
doesn
t
he
oh
that
s
only
his
way
i
think
he
doesn
t
really
mean
to
be
haughty
and
and
so
i
wish
i
knew
if
he
had
any
connection
with
tarrant
s
blacklead
said
miss
lord
mischievously
why
not
ask
him
they
laughed
merrily
jessica
s
thin
note
contrasting
with
the
mellow
timbre
of
her
friend
s
voice
i
will
some
you
would
never
dare
to
i
daren
t
then
i
will
it
would
be
dreadfully
i
don
t
mind
being
thought
rude
replied
nancy
with
a
movement
of
the
head
if
it
teaches
people
that
i
consider
myself
as
good
as
they
well
will
you
come
if
you
ll
go
somewhere
else
with
me
in
the
where
to
to
walk
about
the
streets
after
dark
and
see
the
crowds
and
the
nancy
uttered
this
with
a
sly
mirthfulness
her
friend
was
astonished
nonsense
you
don
t
mean
i
do
i
want
to
go
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
should
feel
ashamed
of
myself
if
i
ran
to
stare
at
royalties
but
it
s
a
different
thing
at
night
it
ll
be
wonderful
all
the
traffic
stopped
and
the
streets
crammed
with
people
and
blazing
with
lights
won
t
you
go
but
the
time
the
time
i
can
t
afford
it
i
m
getting
on
so
wretchedly
with
my
greek
and
my
you
ve
time
enough
said
nancy
and
you
know
after
all
it
s
a
historical
event
in
the
year
it
will
be
set
in
an
examination
paper
and
poor
wretches
will
get
plucked
because
they
don
t
know
the
this
was
quite
a
new
aspect
of
the
matter
to
jessica
morgan
she
pondered
it
and
smiled
yes
i
suppose
it
will
but
we
should
have
to
be
out
so
why
not
for
once
it
needn
t
be
later
than
nancy
broke
off
and
gesticulated
that
s
just
why
i
want
to
go
i
should
like
to
walk
about
all
night
as
lots
of
people
will
the
are
going
to
be
kept
open
till
two
o
do
you
want
to
go
into
asked
jessica
laughing
why
not
i
should
like
to
it
s
horrible
to
be
tied
up
as
we
are
we
re
not
children
why
can
t
we
go
about
as
men
do
won
t
your
father
make
any
objection
asked
jessica
we
shall
take
horace
with
us
your
people
wouldn
t
interfere
would
they
i
think
not
father
is
away
in
yorkshire
and
will
be
till
the
end
of
the
week
poor
mother
has
her
rheumatism
the
house
is
so
dreadfully
damp
we
ought
never
to
have
taken
it
the
difference
of
rent
will
all
go
in
doctors
i
don
t
think
mother
would
mind
but
i
must
be
back
before
twelve
of
i
don
t
see
the
of
course
nancy
returned
impatiently
but
we
could
manage
that
i
ll
speak
to
the
pasha
and
either
come
or
let
you
have
a
note
morning
if
there
s
any
objection
i
m
not
sure
that
i
shan
t
make
it
the
opportunity
for
setting
up
my
standard
of
revolt
but
i
don
t
like
to
do
that
whilst
the
pasha
is
out
of
sorts
it
might
make
him
you
could
reason
with
him
reason
with
the
pasha
how
innocent
you
are
jess
how
unworldly
it
always
refreshes
me
to
hear
you
chapter
only
twelve
months
ago
stephen
lord
had
renewed
the
lease
of
his
house
for
a
period
of
seven
years
nancy
had
she
been
aware
of
this
transaction
would
assuredly
have
found
courage
to
enter
a
protest
but
lord
consulted
neither
son
nor
daughter
on
any
point
of
business
but
for
this
habit
of
acting
silently
he
would
have
seemed
to
his
children
a
still
more
arbitrary
ruler
than
they
actually
thought
him
the
dwelling
consisted
of
but
eight
rooms
one
of
which
situated
at
the
rear
of
the
entrance
passage
served
lord
as
and
it
overlooked
a
small
garden
and
afforded
a
side
glimpse
of
the
kitchen
with
its
outer
appurtenances
in
the
front
room
the
family
took
meals
of
the
chambers
in
the
storey
above
one
was
nancy
s
one
her
brother
s
the
third
had
until
six
years
ago
been
known
as
grandmother
s
room
and
here
its
occupant
stephen
lord
s
mother
died
at
the
age
of
wife
of
a
norfolk
farmer
and
mother
of
nine
children
she
was
one
of
the
women
whose
thoughts
found
abundant
occupation
in
the
cares
and
pleasures
of
home
hardship
she
had
never
known
nor
yet
luxury
the
old
religion
the
old
views
of
sex
and
of
society
endured
with
her
to
the
end
after
her
death
the
room
was
converted
into
a
parlour
used
almost
exclusively
by
the
young
people
at
the
top
of
the
house
slept
two
servants
each
in
her
own
retreat
one
of
them
was
a
girl
the
other
a
woman
of
about
forty
named
mary
woodruff
mary
had
been
in
the
house
for
twenty
years
she
enjoyed
her
master
s
confidence
and
since
old
lord
s
death
exercised
practical
control
in
the
humbler
domestic
affairs
with
one
exception
all
parts
of
the
abode
presented
much
the
same
appearance
as
when
stephen
lord
first
established
himself
antiquated
and
in
primitive
taste
nancy
s
bedroom
alone
here
the
furniture
was
old
solid
homely
the
ornaments
were
displayed
the
influence
of
modern
ideas
on
her
twentieth
birthday
the
girl
received
permission
to
dress
henceforth
as
she
chose
a
strict
sumptuary
law
having
previously
been
in
force
and
at
the
same
time
was
allowed
to
refurnish
her
chamber
nancy
pleaded
for
modern
reforms
throughout
the
house
but
in
vain
even
the
kept
its
uninviting
aspect
not
very
different
save
for
the
removal
of
the
bed
from
that
it
had
presented
when
the
ancient
lady
slept
here
in
her
own
little
domain
miss
lord
made
a
clean
sweep
of
rude
appointments
and
at
small
expense
surrounded
herself
with
pretty
things
the
woodwork
and
the
furniture
were
in
white
enamel
the
paper
had
a
pattern
of
a
choice
chintz
and
flower
on
a
white
ground
served
for
curtains
and
for
her
carpet
was
of
green
felt
matching
in
shade
the
foliage
of
the
chintz
on
suspended
shelves
stood
the
books
which
she
desired
to
have
near
her
and
round
about
the
walls
hung
prints
photographs
chromolithographs
selected
in
an
honest
spirit
of
admiration
which
on
the
whole
did
no
discredit
to
nancy
s
sensibilities
to
the
best
of
nancy
s
belief
her
father
had
never
seen
this
room
on
its
completion
she
invited
him
to
inspect
it
but
lord
coldly
declined
saying
that
he
knew
nothing
and
cared
nothing
about
upholstery
his
return
was
earlier
than
usual
shortly
after
five
o
clock
nancy
heard
the
familiar
heavy
step
in
the
passage
and
went
downstairs
will
you
have
a
cup
of
tea
father
she
asked
standing
by
the
door
of
the
back
room
which
was
ajar
if
it
s
ready
replied
a
deep
voice
she
entered
the
and
rang
the
bell
in
a
few
minutes
mary
woodruff
appeared
bringing
tea
and
biscuits
she
was
a
neat
quiet
woman
of
strong
physique
and
with
set
lips
which
rarely
parted
save
for
necessary
speech
her
eyes
had
a
singular
expression
of
inquietude
of
sadness
a
smile
seldom
appeared
on
her
face
but
when
it
did
the
effect
was
unlooked
for
it
touched
the
somewhat
harsh
lineaments
with
a
gentleness
so
pleasing
that
she
became
almost
comely
having
set
down
the
tray
she
went
to
lord
s
door
gave
a
soft
tap
and
withdrew
into
the
kitchen
nancy
seated
at
the
table
turned
to
greet
her
father
in
early
life
stephen
lord
must
have
been
handsome
his
face
was
now
rugged
of
unhealthy
tone
and
creased
with
lines
betokening
a
moody
habit
he
looked
much
older
than
his
years
which
were
dressed
with
excessive
carelessness
he
had
the
appearance
rather
of
one
at
odds
with
fortune
than
of
a
substantial
man
of
business
his
short
beard
was
raggedly
trimmed
his
grizzled
hair
began
to
show
the
scalp
judging
from
the
contour
of
his
visage
one
might
have
credited
him
with
a
forcible
and
commanding
character
his
voice
favoured
that
impression
but
the
countenance
had
a
despondent
cast
the
eyes
seemed
to
shun
observation
the
lips
suggested
a
sullen
pride
indicative
of
some
defect
or
vice
of
will
yet
in
the
look
which
he
cast
upon
her
nancy
detected
a
sign
of
more
amiability
than
she
had
found
in
him
of
late
she
addressed
him
with
confidence
early
the
monosyllable
sounded
gruff
but
again
nancy
felt
satisfaction
lord
who
disliked
to
seat
himself
unless
he
were
going
to
keep
his
position
for
some
time
took
the
offered
beverage
from
his
daughter
s
hand
and
stood
with
it
before
the
fireplace
casting
glances
about
the
room
how
have
you
felt
father
nothing
to
complain
his
pronunciation
fell
short
of
refinement
but
was
not
vulgar
something
of
country
accent
could
still
be
detected
in
it
he
talked
like
a
man
who
could
strike
a
softer
note
if
he
cared
to
but
despises
the
effort
i
suppose
you
will
have
a
rest
i
suppose
so
if
your
grandmother
had
lived
he
added
thoughtfully
she
would
have
been
this
week
on
the
of
june
yes
i
lord
swallowed
his
tea
at
two
draughts
and
put
down
the
cup
seemingly
refreshed
he
looked
about
him
with
a
half
smile
and
said
quietly
i
ve
had
the
pleasure
of
punishing
a
scoundrel
that
s
worth
more
than
the
nancy
waited
for
an
explanation
but
it
was
not
vouchsafed
a
scoundrel
she
asked
her
father
nodded
the
nod
which
signified
his
pleasure
that
the
subject
should
not
be
pursued
nancy
could
only
infer
that
he
spoke
of
some
incident
in
the
course
of
business
as
indeed
was
the
case
he
had
no
particular
aptitude
for
trade
and
that
by
which
he
lived
he
had
entered
upon
it
thirty
years
ago
rather
by
accident
than
choice
was
thoroughly
distasteful
to
him
as
a
dealer
in
pianofortes
he
came
into
contact
with
a
class
of
people
who
inspired
him
with
a
savage
contempt
and
of
late
years
his
business
had
suffered
considerably
from
the
competition
of
tradesmen
who
knew
nothing
of
such
conflicts
between
sentiment
and
interest
a
majority
of
his
customers
obtained
their
pianos
on
the
system
and
oftener
than
not
they
were
persons
of
very
small
or
very
precarious
income
who
rabid
in
the
pursuit
of
gentility
signed
agreements
they
had
little
chance
of
fulfilling
when
in
pecuniary
straits
they
either
raised
money
upon
the
instruments
or
allowed
them
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
distraining
creditors
inquiry
into
the
circumstances
of
a
customer
sometimes
had
ludicrous
results
a
couple
for
instance
would
be
found
tenanting
two
rooms
the
furnishing
whereof
seemed
to
them
incomplete
without
the
piano
of
which
their
friends
and
relatives
boasted
not
a
few
professional
swindlers
came
to
the
office
confederate
rogues
vouching
for
each
other
s
respectability
got
possession
of
pianos
merely
to
pawn
or
sell
them
having
paid
no
more
than
the
first
month
s
charge
it
was
mr
lord
s
experience
that
year
by
year
the
recklessness
of
the
vulgar
became
more
glaring
and
deliberate
fraud
more
artful
he
had
successfully
prosecuted
a
man
who
seemed
to
have
lived
for
some
time
on
the
system
and
it
made
him
unusually
cheerful
you
don
t
think
of
going
to
see
the
queen
said
his
daughter
smiling
what
have
i
to
do
with
the
queen
do
you
wish
to
go
not
to
see
her
majesty
i
care
as
little
about
her
as
you
do
but
i
thought
of
having
a
walk
in
the
nancy
phrased
it
thus
with
intention
she
wished
to
intimate
that
at
her
age
it
could
hardly
be
necessary
to
ask
permission
but
her
father
looked
surprised
in
the
evening
where
oh
about
the
main
streets
to
see
the
people
and
the
her
voice
was
not
quite
firm
but
said
her
father
there
ll
be
such
a
swarm
of
blackguards
as
never
was
known
how
can
you
go
into
such
a
crowd
it
s
astonishing
that
you
should
think
of
the
blackguards
will
be
outnumbered
by
the
decent
people
you
suppose
that
s
possible
he
returned
gloomily
oh
i
think
so
nancy
laughed
at
all
events
there
ll
be
a
great
majority
of
people
who
pretend
to
be
decent
i
have
asked
jessica
morgan
to
go
with
what
right
had
you
to
ask
her
without
first
finding
out
whether
you
could
go
or
not
it
was
spoken
rather
gravely
than
severely
lord
never
looked
fixedly
at
his
daughter
and
even
a
glance
at
her
face
was
unusual
but
at
this
juncture
he
met
her
eyes
for
an
instant
the
nervous
motion
with
which
he
immediately
turned
aside
had
been
marked
by
nancy
on
previous
occasions
and
she
had
understood
it
as
a
sign
of
his
lack
of
affection
for
her
i
am
years
old
father
she
replied
without
aggressiveness
that
would
be
something
of
an
answer
if
you
were
a
man
observed
the
father
his
eyes
cast
down
because
i
am
a
woman
you
despise
me
stephen
was
startled
at
this
unfamiliar
mode
of
address
he
moved
uneasily
if
i
despised
you
nancy
i
shouldn
t
care
very
much
what
you
did
i
suppose
you
must
do
as
you
like
but
you
won
t
go
with
my
there
was
a
silence
then
the
girl
said
i
meant
to
ask
horace
to
go
with
horace
pooh
again
a
silence
lord
laid
down
his
cup
moved
a
few
steps
away
and
turned
back
i
didn
t
think
this
kind
of
thing
was
in
your
way
he
said
gruffly
i
thought
you
were
above
nancy
defended
herself
as
she
had
done
to
jessica
but
without
the
playfulness
in
listening
her
father
seemed
to
weigh
the
merits
of
the
case
conscientiously
with
wrinkled
brows
at
length
he
spoke
horace
is
no
good
but
if
samuel
barmby
will
go
with
you
i
make
no
a
movement
of
annoyance
was
nancy
s
first
reply
she
drummed
with
her
fingers
on
the
table
looking
fixedly
before
her
i
certainly
can
t
ask
barmby
to
come
with
us
she
said
with
an
effort
at
well
you
needn
t
i
ll
speak
about
it
he
waited
and
again
it
chanced
that
their
eyes
met
nancy
on
the
point
of
speaking
checked
herself
a
full
minute
passed
and
stephen
stood
waiting
patiently
if
you
insist
upon
it
said
nancy
rising
from
her
chair
we
will
take
barmby
with
without
comment
lord
left
the
room
and
his
own
door
closed
rather
loudly
behind
him
not
long
afterwards
nancy
heard
a
new
foot
in
the
passage
and
her
brother
made
his
appearance
horace
had
good
looks
but
his
face
showed
already
some
of
the
unpleasant
characteristics
which
time
had
developed
on
that
of
stephen
lord
and
from
which
the
daughter
was
entirely
free
one
judged
him
slow
of
intellect
and
weakly
his
hair
was
of
pale
chestnut
the
silky
pencillings
of
his
moustache
considerably
darker
his
cheek
delicately
pink
and
easily
changing
to
a
warmer
hue
his
lips
and
the
limpid
glistening
of
his
eyes
showed
him
of
frail
constitution
he
was
very
slim
and
narrow
across
the
shoulders
the
fashion
of
his
attire
tended
to
a
dandiacal
extreme
modish
silk
hat
lavender
necktie
white
waistcoat
gaiters
over
his
shoes
gloves
crushed
together
in
one
hand
and
in
the
other
a
bamboo
cane
for
the
last
year
or
two
he
had
been
progressing
in
this
direction
despite
his
father
s
scornful
remarks
and
his
sister
s
mockery
father
in
yet
he
asked
at
the
door
of
the
in
subdued
voice
nancy
nodded
and
the
young
man
withdrew
to
lay
aside
his
outdoor
equipments
what
sort
of
temper
was
his
question
when
he
returned
pretty
good
until
i
spoilt
horace
exhibited
a
pettish
annoyance
what
on
earth
did
you
do
that
for
i
want
to
have
a
talk
with
him
about
what
oh
never
mind
i
ll
tell
you
both
kept
their
voices
low
as
if
afraid
of
being
overheard
in
the
next
room
horace
began
to
nibble
at
a
biscuit
the
hour
of
his
return
made
it
unnecessary
for
him
as
a
rule
to
take
anything
before
dinner
but
at
present
he
seemed
in
a
nervous
condition
and
acted
mechanically
come
out
into
the
garden
will
you
he
said
after
receiving
a
brief
explanation
of
what
had
passed
between
nancy
and
her
father
i
ve
something
to
tell
his
sister
carelessly
assented
and
with
heads
uncovered
they
went
through
the
house
into
the
open
air
the
garden
was
but
a
strip
of
ground
bounded
by
walls
of
four
feet
high
in
the
midst
stood
a
laburnum
now
heavy
with
golden
bloom
and
at
the
end
grew
a
flanked
with
laurels
a
border
displayed
stephen
lord
s
taste
and
industry
nancy
seated
herself
on
a
rustic
bench
in
the
shadow
of
the
laburnum
and
horace
stood
before
her
one
of
the
branches
in
his
hand
i
promised
fanny
to
take
her
night
he
began
awkwardly
oh
you
have
and
we
re
going
together
in
the
morning
you
i
know
now
i
didn
t
before
nancy
replied
of
course
we
can
make
a
party
in
the
of
horace
looked
up
at
the
ugly
and
hesitated
before
proceeding
that
isn
t
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about
he
said
at
length
a
very
queer
thing
has
happened
a
thing
i
can
t
make
out
at
the
listener
looked
her
curiosity
i
promised
to
say
nothing
about
it
but
there
s
no
harm
in
telling
you
you
know
you
remember
i
was
away
last
saturday
afternoon
well
just
when
it
was
time
to
leave
the
office
that
day
the
porter
came
to
say
that
a
lady
wished
to
see
me
a
lady
in
a
carriage
outside
of
course
i
couldn
t
make
it
out
at
all
but
i
went
down
as
quickly
as
possible
and
saw
the
carriage
waiting
there
a
brougham
and
marched
up
to
the
door
inside
there
was
a
lady
a
great
swell
smiling
at
me
as
if
we
were
friends
i
took
off
my
hat
and
said
that
i
was
lord
yes
she
said
i
see
you
are
and
she
asked
if
i
could
spare
her
an
hour
or
two
as
she
wished
to
speak
to
me
of
something
important
well
of
course
i
could
only
say
that
i
had
nothing
particular
to
do
that
i
was
just
going
home
then
will
you
do
me
the
pleasure
she
said
to
come
and
have
lunch
with
me
i
live
in
weymouth
street
portland
the
young
man
paused
to
watch
the
effect
of
his
narrative
especially
of
the
last
words
nancy
returned
his
gaze
with
frank
astonishment
what
sort
of
lady
was
it
she
asked
oh
a
great
swell
somebody
in
the
best
society
you
could
see
that
at
but
how
old
well
i
couldn
t
tell
exactly
about
forty
i
should
oh
go
one
couldn
t
refuse
you
know
i
was
only
too
glad
to
go
to
a
house
in
the
west
end
she
opened
the
from
the
inside
and
i
got
in
and
off
we
drove
i
felt
awkward
of
course
but
after
all
i
was
decently
dressed
and
i
suppose
i
can
behave
like
a
gentleman
and
well
she
sat
looking
at
me
and
smiling
and
i
could
only
smile
back
then
she
said
she
must
apologise
for
behaving
so
strangely
but
i
was
very
young
and
she
was
an
old
woman
one
couldn
t
call
her
that
though
and
she
had
taken
this
way
of
renewing
her
acquaintance
with
me
renewing
but
i
didn
t
remember
to
have
ever
met
her
before
i
said
oh
yes
we
have
met
before
but
you
were
a
little
child
a
baby
in
fact
and
there
s
no
wonder
you
don
t
remember
me
and
then
she
said
i
knew
your
mother
very
nancy
leaned
forward
her
lips
apart
queer
wasn
t
it
then
she
went
on
to
say
that
her
name
was
damerel
had
i
ever
heard
it
no
i
couldn
t
remember
the
name
at
all
she
was
a
widow
she
said
and
had
lived
mostly
abroad
for
a
great
many
years
now
she
was
come
back
to
settle
in
england
she
hadn
t
a
house
of
her
own
yet
but
lived
at
a
she
didn
t
know
whether
to
take
a
house
in
london
or
somewhere
just
out
in
the
country
then
she
began
to
ask
about
father
and
about
you
and
it
seemed
to
amuse
her
when
i
looked
puzzled
she
s
a
jolly
sort
of
person
always
did
she
say
anything
more
about
our
mother
i
ll
tell
you
about
that
presently
we
got
to
the
house
and
went
in
and
she
took
me
upstairs
to
her
own
private
where
the
table
was
laid
for
two
she
said
that
she
usually
had
her
meals
with
the
other
people
but
it
would
be
better
for
us
to
be
alone
so
that
we
could
how
did
she
know
where
to
find
you
nancy
inquired
of
course
i
wondered
about
that
but
i
didn
t
like
to
ask
well
she
went
away
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
we
had
lunch
everything
was
of
course
wines
to
choose
from
and
a
rattling
good
cigar
afterwards
for
me
i
mean
she
brought
out
a
box
said
they
were
her
husband
s
and
had
a
laugh
about
how
long
has
she
been
a
widow
asked
nancy
i
don
t
know
she
didn
t
wear
colours
i
noticed
perhaps
it
was
a
fashionable
sort
of
mourning
we
talked
about
all
sorts
of
things
i
soon
made
myself
quite
at
home
and
at
last
she
began
to
explain
she
was
a
friend
of
mother
s
years
and
years
ago
and
father
was
the
cause
of
their
parting
a
quarrel
about
something
she
didn
t
say
exactly
what
and
it
had
suddenly
struck
her
that
she
would
like
to
know
how
we
were
getting
on
then
she
asked
me
to
promise
that
i
would
tell
no
she
knew
about
mother
s
death
i
suppose
oh
yes
she
knew
about
that
it
happened
not
very
long
after
the
affair
that
parted
them
she
asked
a
good
many
questions
about
you
and
she
wanted
to
know
how
father
had
got
on
in
his
what
did
you
say
oh
i
told
her
i
really
didn
t
know
much
about
it
and
she
laughed
at
how
long
did
you
stay
there
till
about
four
but
there
s
something
else
before
i
went
away
she
gave
me
an
invitation
for
next
saturday
she
wants
me
to
meet
her
at
portland
road
station
and
go
out
to
richmond
and
have
dinner
shall
you
go
well
it
s
very
awkward
i
want
to
go
somewhere
else
on
saturday
with
fanny
but
i
didn
t
see
how
to
nancy
wore
a
look
of
grave
reflection
and
kept
silence
it
isn
t
a
bad
thing
you
know
pursued
her
brother
to
have
a
friend
of
that
sort
there
s
no
knowing
what
use
she
might
be
especially
just
his
tone
caused
nancy
to
look
up
why
just
now
i
ll
tell
you
after
i
ve
had
a
talk
with
father
horace
replied
setting
his
countenance
to
a
show
of
energetic
resolve
shall
i
guess
what
you
re
going
to
talk
about
if
you
she
gazed
at
him
you
re
surely
not
so
silly
as
to
tell
father
about
all
that
nonsense
what
nonsense
exclaimed
the
other
indignantly
why
with
fanny
you
ll
find
that
it
s
anything
but
nonsense
horace
replied
raising
his
brows
and
gazing
straight
before
him
with
expanded
nostrils
all
right
let
me
know
the
result
it
s
time
to
go
horace
sat
alone
for
a
minute
or
two
his
legs
at
full
length
his
feet
crossed
and
the
upper
part
of
his
body
bent
forward
he
smiled
to
himself
a
smile
of
singular
fatuity
and
began
to
hum
a
popular
tune
chapter
when
they
assembled
at
table
lord
had
recovered
his
moderate
cheerfulness
essentially
he
was
anything
but
horace
and
nancy
were
far
from
regarding
him
with
that
resentful
bitterness
which
is
produced
in
the
victims
of
a
really
harsh
parent
ten
years
ago
as
they
well
remembered
anger
was
a
rare
thing
in
his
behaviour
to
them
and
kindness
the
rule
affectionate
he
had
never
shown
himself
reserve
and
austerity
had
always
distinguished
him
even
it
was
generally
safe
to
anticipate
mildness
from
him
at
the
evening
meal
in
the
matter
of
eating
and
drinking
his
prudence
notably
contradicted
his
precepts
he
loved
strong
meats
dishes
highly
flavoured
and
partook
of
them
without
moderation
at
table
his
beverage
was
ale
for
wine
unless
it
were
very
sweet
port
he
cared
little
but
in
the
privacy
of
his
own
room
whilst
smoking
numberless
pipes
of
rank
tobacco
he
indulged
freely
in
spirits
the
habit
was
unknown
to
his
children
but
for
some
years
he
had
seldom
gone
to
bed
in
a
condition
that
merited
the
name
of
sobriety
when
the
repast
was
nearly
over
lord
glanced
at
his
son
and
said
unconcernedly
you
have
heard
that
nancy
wants
to
mix
with
the
and
bobtail
night
i
shall
take
care
of
her
horace
replied
starting
from
his
reverie
doesn
t
it
seem
to
you
rather
a
for
an
educated
young
lady
oh
there
ll
be
lots
of
them
will
there
then
i
can
t
see
much
difference
between
them
and
the
servant
nancy
put
in
a
word
that
shows
you
don
t
in
the
least
understand
me
we
won
t
argue
about
it
but
bear
in
mind
horace
that
you
bring
your
sister
back
not
later
than
eleven
you
are
to
be
here
by
that
s
rather
early
replied
the
young
man
though
in
a
submissive
tone
it
s
the
hour
i
appoint
samuel
barmby
will
be
with
you
and
he
will
know
the
arrangement
but
i
tell
you
now
so
that
there
may
be
no
nancy
sat
in
a
very
upright
position
displeasure
plain
upon
her
countenance
but
she
made
no
remark
horace
who
had
his
reasons
for
desiring
to
preserve
a
genial
tone
affected
acquiescence
presently
he
and
his
sister
went
upstairs
to
the
where
they
sat
down
at
a
distance
apart
nancy
by
the
window
gazing
at
the
warm
clouds
above
the
roofs
opposite
the
young
man
in
a
corner
which
the
dusk
already
shadowed
some
time
passed
before
either
spoke
and
it
was
horace
s
voice
which
first
made
itself
heard
nancy
don
t
you
think
it
s
about
time
we
began
to
behave
firmly
it
depends
what
you
mean
by
firmness
she
answered
in
an
absent
tone
we
re
old
enough
to
judge
for
i
am
no
doubt
but
i
m
not
so
sure
about
oh
all
right
then
we
won
t
talk
about
another
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
the
room
was
in
twilight
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
and
mary
woodruff
a
in
her
hand
entered
to
light
the
gas
having
drawn
the
blind
and
given
a
glance
round
to
see
that
everything
was
in
order
she
addressed
nancy
her
tone
perfectly
respectful
though
she
used
no
formality
martha
has
been
asking
me
whether
she
can
go
out
night
for
an
hour
or
you
don
t
wish
to
go
yourself
miss
lord
returned
her
voice
significant
of
familiarity
oh
no
and
mary
showed
one
of
her
infrequent
smiles
she
may
go
immediately
after
dinner
and
be
away
till
the
servant
bent
her
head
and
withdrew
as
soon
as
she
was
gone
horace
laughed
there
you
are
what
did
father
say
nancy
was
silent
well
i
m
going
to
have
a
word
with
him
continued
the
young
man
sauntering
towards
the
door
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
he
looked
exceedingly
nervous
when
i
come
back
i
may
have
something
to
tell
very
likely
remarked
his
sister
in
a
dry
tone
and
seated
herself
under
the
chandelier
with
a
book
horace
slowly
descended
the
stairs
at
the
foot
he
stood
for
a
moment
then
moved
towards
his
father
s
door
another
hesitancy
though
briefer
and
he
knocked
for
admission
which
was
at
once
granted
lord
sat
in
his
chair
smoking
a
pipe
on
his
knees
an
evening
paper
he
looked
at
horace
from
under
his
eyebrows
but
with
good
humour
coming
to
report
progress
yes
father
and
to
talk
over
things
in
the
slim
youth
he
could
hardly
be
deemed
more
than
a
lad
tried
to
assume
an
easy
position
with
his
elbow
on
the
corner
of
the
mantelpiece
but
his
feet
shuffled
and
his
eyes
strayed
vacantly
it
cost
him
an
effort
to
begin
his
customary
account
of
how
things
were
going
with
him
at
the
in
truth
there
was
nothing
particular
to
report
there
never
was
anything
particular
but
horace
always
endeavoured
to
show
that
he
had
made
headway
and
he
spoke
with
a
very
pronounced
optimism
very
well
my
boy
said
his
father
if
you
are
satisfied
i
shall
try
to
be
the
same
have
you
your
pipe
with
you
at
your
age
i
hadn
t
begun
to
smoke
and
i
should
advise
you
to
be
moderate
but
we
ll
have
a
whiff
together
if
you
i
ll
go
and
fetch
it
horace
replied
impulsively
he
came
back
with
a
rather
expensive
meerschaum
recently
purchased
hollo
luxuries
exclaimed
his
father
it
kept
catching
my
eye
in
a
window
and
at
last
i
couldn
t
resist
tobacco
s
quite
a
different
thing
out
of
a
pipe
like
this
you
no
one
seeing
them
thus
together
could
have
doubted
of
the
affectionate
feeling
which
stephen
lord
entertained
for
his
son
it
appeared
in
his
frequent
glances
in
the
relaxation
of
his
features
in
a
certain
abandonment
of
his
whole
frame
as
though
he
had
only
just
begun
to
enjoy
the
evening
s
repose
i
ve
something
rather
important
to
speak
about
father
horace
began
when
he
had
puffed
for
a
few
minutes
in
silence
oh
what
s
that
you
remember
telling
me
when
i
was
one
and
twenty
that
you
wished
me
to
work
my
way
up
and
win
an
income
of
my
own
but
that
i
could
look
to
you
for
help
if
ever
there
was
need
of
it
yes
stephen
remembered
he
had
frequently
called
it
to
mind
and
wondered
whether
it
was
wisely
said
the
youth
s
character
considered
what
of
that
he
returned
still
genially
do
you
think
of
starting
a
new
line
of
ocean
steamships
well
not
just
yet
horace
answered
with
an
uncertain
laugh
i
have
something
more
moderate
in
view
i
may
start
a
competition
with
the
and
let
s
hear
about
i
dare
say
it
will
surprise
you
a
little
the
fact
is
i
i
am
thinking
of
getting
the
father
did
not
move
but
smoke
ceased
to
issue
from
his
lips
and
his
eyes
fixed
upon
horace
widened
a
little
in
puzzled
amusement
thinking
of
it
are
you
he
said
in
an
undertone
as
one
speaks
of
some
trifle
no
harm
in
thinking
too
many
people
do
it
without
thinking
at
i
m
not
one
of
that
kind
said
horace
with
an
air
of
maturity
which
was
meant
to
rebuke
his
father
s
jest
i
know
what
i
m
about
i
ve
thought
it
over
thoroughly
you
don
t
think
it
too
soon
i
hope
horace
s
pipe
was
going
out
he
held
it
against
his
knee
and
regarded
it
with
unconscious
eyes
i
dare
say
it
won
t
be
said
lord
when
you
have
found
a
suitable
oh
but
you
misunderstand
me
i
mean
that
i
have
decided
to
marry
a
particular
and
who
may
that
be
the
younger
miss
french
his
voice
quivered
over
the
name
at
the
end
he
gave
a
gasp
and
a
gulp
of
a
sudden
his
lips
and
tongue
were
very
dry
and
he
felt
a
disagreeable
chill
running
down
his
back
for
the
listener
s
face
had
altered
noticeably
it
was
dark
stern
and
something
worse
but
lord
could
still
speak
with
you
have
asked
her
to
marry
you
yes
i
have
and
she
has
horace
felt
his
courage
returning
like
the
second
wind
of
a
runner
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
gone
through
the
worst
the
disclosure
was
made
and
had
resulted
in
no
outbreak
of
fury
now
he
could
begin
to
plead
his
cause
imagination
excited
by
nervous
stress
brought
before
him
a
clear
picture
of
the
beloved
fanny
with
fluffy
hair
upon
her
forehead
and
a
laugh
on
her
lips
he
spoke
without
effort
i
thought
that
there
would
be
no
harm
in
asking
you
to
help
us
we
should
be
quite
content
to
start
on
a
couple
of
hundred
a
year
quite
that
is
only
about
fifty
pounds
more
than
we
inspires
many
an
audacity
to
horace
there
seemed
nothing
outrageous
in
this
suggestion
he
had
talked
it
over
with
fanny
french
several
times
and
they
had
agreed
that
his
father
could
not
in
decency
offer
them
than
a
hundred
a
year
he
began
to
shake
out
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
with
a
vague
intention
of
relighting
it
you
really
imagine
said
his
father
that
i
should
give
you
money
to
enable
you
to
marry
that
idiot
evidently
he
put
a
severe
restraint
upon
himself
the
veins
of
his
temples
were
congested
his
nostrils
grew
wide
and
he
spoke
rather
hoarsely
horace
straightened
his
back
and
though
in
great
fear
strung
himself
for
conflict
i
don
t
see
what
right
to
insult
the
young
his
father
took
him
up
sternly
young
lady
what
do
you
mean
by
young
lady
after
all
your
education
haven
t
you
learnt
to
distinguish
a
lady
from
a
kitchen
wench
had
none
of
your
advantages
there
was
there
would
have
been
some
excuse
for
if
i
had
made
such
a
fool
of
myself
what
were
you
doing
all
those
years
at
school
if
it
wasn
t
learning
the
difference
between
real
and
sham
getting
to
understand
things
better
than
poor
folks
children
you
disappointed
me
and
a
good
deal
more
than
i
ever
told
you
i
had
hoped
you
would
come
from
school
better
able
to
make
a
place
in
the
world
than
your
father
was
i
made
up
my
mind
long
ago
that
you
should
never
go
into
my
business
you
were
to
be
something
a
good
deal
better
but
after
all
you
couldn
t
or
wouldn
t
do
what
i
wanted
never
mind
i
said
to
myself
never
mind
at
all
events
he
has
learnt
to
in
a
better
way
than
if
i
had
sent
him
to
common
schools
and
after
all
that
s
the
main
thing
but
here
you
come
to
me
and
talk
of
marrying
a
creature
who
wouldn
t
be
good
enough
for
the
meanest
clerk
how
do
you
know
that
father
what
what
right
have
you
to
say
such
things
without
knowing
more
of
her
than
you
do
there
was
a
brief
silence
before
lord
spoke
again
you
are
very
young
he
said
with
less
vehement
contempt
i
must
remember
that
at
your
age
a
lad
has
a
sort
of
devil
in
him
that
s
always
driving
him
out
of
the
path
of
common
sense
whether
he
will
or
no
i
ll
try
my
best
to
talk
quietly
with
you
does
your
sister
know
what
has
been
going
on
i
daresay
she
does
i
haven
t
told
her
in
so
many
i
never
thought
of
it
pursued
lord
gloomily
i
took
it
for
granted
that
everybody
must
see
those
people
as
i
myself
did
i
have
wondered
now
and
then
why
nancy
kept
up
any
kind
of
acquaintance
with
them
but
she
spoke
of
them
in
the
rational
way
and
that
seemed
enough
i
may
have
thought
that
they
might
get
some
sort
of
good
out
of
and
i
felt
sure
she
had
too
much
sense
to
get
harm
from
if
it
hadn
t
been
so
i
should
have
forbidden
her
to
know
them
at
all
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
i
don
t
want
to
think
worse
of
you
than
i
need
i
can
make
allowance
for
your
age
as
i
said
what
do
you
see
in
that
girl
just
talk
to
me
freely
and
after
all
you
have
said
replied
horace
his
voice
still
shaky
what
s
the
use
you
seem
to
be
convinced
that
there
isn
t
a
single
good
quality
in
so
i
am
what
i
want
to
know
is
what
good
have
a
great
deal
else
i
shouldn
t
have
asked
her
to
marry
a
vein
of
stubbornness
unmistakable
inheritance
from
stephen
lord
had
begun
to
appear
in
the
youth
s
speech
and
bearing
he
kept
his
head
bent
and
moved
it
a
little
from
side
to
side
do
you
think
her
an
exception
in
the
family
then
she
s
a
great
deal
better
in
every
way
than
her
sisters
but
i
don
t
think
as
badly
of
them
as
you
lord
stepped
to
the
door
and
out
into
the
passage
where
he
shouted
in
his
deep
voice
nancy
the
girl
quickly
appeared
shut
the
door
please
said
her
father
all
three
were
now
standing
about
the
room
your
brother
has
brought
me
a
piece
of
news
it
ought
to
interest
you
i
should
think
he
wants
to
marry
and
out
of
all
the
world
he
has
chosen
miss
french
the
horace
s
position
was
trying
he
did
not
know
what
to
do
with
his
hands
and
he
kept
balancing
now
on
one
foot
now
on
the
other
nancy
had
her
eyes
averted
from
him
but
she
met
her
father
s
look
gravely
now
i
want
to
ask
you
lord
proceeded
whether
you
consider
miss
french
a
suitable
wife
for
your
brother
just
give
me
a
plain
yes
or
i
certainly
don
t
replied
the
girl
barely
subduing
the
tremor
of
her
voice
both
my
children
are
not
fools
thank
heaven
now
tell
me
if
you
can
what
fault
you
have
to
find
with
the
young
lady
as
your
brother
calls
her
for
one
thing
i
don
t
think
her
horace
s
equal
she
can
t
really
be
called
a
you
are
listening
horace
bit
his
lip
in
mortification
and
again
his
head
swung
doggedly
from
side
to
side
we
might
pass
over
that
added
lord
what
about
her
character
is
there
any
good
point
in
her
i
don
t
think
she
means
any
harm
but
she
s
silly
and
i
ve
often
thought
her
you
are
listening
horace
lost
patience
then
why
do
you
pretend
to
be
friends
with
her
he
demanded
almost
fiercely
i
don
t
replied
his
sister
with
a
note
of
disdain
we
knew
each
other
at
school
and
we
haven
t
altogether
broken
off
that
s
it
isn
t
all
shouted
the
young
man
on
a
high
key
if
you
re
not
friendly
with
her
and
her
sisters
you
ve
been
a
great
hypocrite
it
s
only
just
lately
you
have
begun
to
think
yourself
too
good
for
them
they
used
to
come
here
and
you
went
to
them
and
you
talked
just
like
friends
would
do
it
s
abominable
to
turn
round
like
this
for
the
sake
of
taking
father
s
side
against
me
lord
regarded
his
son
contemptuously
there
was
a
rather
long
silence
he
spoke
at
length
with
severe
deliberation
when
you
are
ten
years
older
you
ll
know
a
good
deal
more
about
young
women
as
they
re
turned
out
in
these
times
you
ll
have
heard
the
talk
of
men
who
have
been
fools
enough
to
marry
choice
specimens
when
common
sense
has
a
chance
of
getting
in
a
word
with
you
you
ll
understand
what
i
now
tell
you
wherever
you
look
there
s
sham
and
rottenness
but
the
most
worthless
creature
living
is
one
of
these
trashy
flashy
girls
the
kind
of
girl
you
see
everywhere
high
and
low
calling
themselves
ladies
thinking
themselves
too
good
for
any
honest
womanly
work
town
and
country
it
s
all
the
same
they
re
educated
oh
yes
they
re
educated
what
sort
of
wives
do
they
make
with
their
education
what
sort
of
mothers
are
they
before
long
there
ll
be
no
such
thing
as
a
home
they
don
t
know
what
the
word
means
they
d
like
to
live
in
hotels
and
trollop
about
the
streets
day
and
night
there
won
t
be
any
servants
much
longer
you
re
lucky
if
you
find
one
of
the
old
sort
who
knows
how
to
light
a
fire
or
wash
a
dish
go
into
the
houses
of
men
with
small
incomes
what
do
you
find
but
filth
and
disorder
quarrelling
and
misery
young
men
are
bad
enough
i
know
that
they
want
to
begin
where
their
fathers
left
off
and
if
they
can
t
do
it
honestly
they
ll
embezzle
or
forge
but
you
ll
often
find
there
s
a
worthless
wife
at
the
bottom
of
it
worrying
and
nagging
because
she
has
a
smaller
house
than
some
other
woman
because
she
can
t
get
silks
and
furs
and
wants
to
ride
in
a
cab
instead
of
an
omnibus
it
is
astounding
to
me
that
they
don
t
get
their
necks
wrung
only
wait
a
bit
we
shall
come
to
that
presently
it
was
a
rare
thing
for
stephen
lord
to
talk
at
such
length
he
ceased
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
sat
down
again
in
his
chair
horace
and
his
sister
waited
i
ve
no
more
to
say
fell
from
their
father
at
length
go
and
talk
about
it
together
if
you
horace
moved
sullenly
towards
the
door
and
with
a
glance
at
his
sister
went
out
nancy
after
lingering
for
a
moment
spoke
i
don
t
think
you
need
have
any
fear
of
it
perhaps
not
but
if
it
isn
t
that
one
it
ll
be
another
like
her
there
s
not
much
choice
for
a
lad
like
nancy
changed
her
purpose
of
leaving
the
room
and
drew
a
step
nearer
don
t
you
think
there
have
been
lord
turned
to
look
at
her
how
what
do
you
mean
i
don
t
want
to
make
you
angry
with
me
say
what
you
ve
got
to
say
broke
in
her
father
impatiently
it
isn
t
easy
when
you
so
soon
lose
your
my
girl
for
once
he
gazed
at
her
directly
if
you
knew
all
i
have
gone
through
in
life
you
wouldn
t
wonder
at
my
temper
being
what
do
you
mean
what
could
i
have
done
she
stood
before
him
and
spoke
with
diffidence
don
t
you
think
that
if
we
had
lived
in
a
different
way
horace
and
i
might
have
had
friends
of
a
better
kind
a
different
way
i
understand
you
mean
i
ought
to
have
had
a
big
house
and
made
a
show
isn
t
that
it
you
gave
us
a
good
education
replied
nancy
still
in
the
same
tone
and
we
might
have
associated
with
very
different
people
from
those
you
have
been
speaking
of
but
education
alone
isn
t
enough
one
must
live
as
the
better
people
exactly
that
s
your
way
of
thinking
and
how
do
you
know
that
i
could
afford
it
to
begin
with
perhaps
i
oughtn
t
to
have
taken
that
for
perhaps
not
young
women
take
a
good
deal
for
granted
now
but
supposing
you
were
right
are
you
silly
enough
to
think
that
richer
people
are
better
people
as
a
matter
of
course
not
as
a
matter
of
course
said
nancy
but
i
m
quite
sure
i
know
from
what
i
ve
seen
that
there
s
more
chance
of
meeting
nice
people
among
what
do
you
mean
by
nice
lord
was
lying
back
in
his
chair
and
spoke
thickly
as
if
wearied
people
who
can
talk
so
that
you
forget
they
re
only
using
words
they
ve
learnt
like
parrots
no
just
the
contrary
people
who
have
something
to
say
worth
listening
if
you
take
my
advice
you
ll
pay
less
attention
to
what
people
say
and
more
to
what
they
do
what
s
the
good
of
a
friend
who
won
t
come
to
see
you
because
you
live
in
a
small
house
that
s
the
plain
english
of
it
if
i
had
done
as
i
thought
right
i
should
never
have
sent
you
to
school
at
all
i
should
have
had
you
taught
at
home
all
that
s
necessary
to
make
a
good
girl
and
an
honest
woman
and
have
done
my
best
to
keep
you
away
from
the
kind
of
life
that
i
hate
but
i
hadn
t
the
courage
to
act
as
i
believed
i
knew
how
the
times
were
changing
and
i
was
weak
enough
to
be
afraid
i
might
do
you
an
injustice
i
did
give
you
the
chance
of
making
friends
among
better
people
than
your
father
didn
t
i
use
to
talk
to
you
about
your
school
friends
and
encourage
you
when
they
seemed
of
the
right
kind
and
now
you
tell
me
that
they
don
t
care
for
your
society
because
you
live
in
a
decent
unpretending
way
i
should
think
you
re
better
without
such
nancy
reflected
seemed
about
to
prolong
the
argument
but
spoke
at
length
in
another
voice
well
i
will
say
it
was
not
usual
for
them
to
see
each
other
after
dinner
so
that
a
could
seldom
be
exchanged
the
girl
drawing
away
expected
a
response
she
saw
her
father
nod
but
he
said
nothing
father
she
repeated
from
a
distance
nancy
came
in
impatient
reply
chapter
on
tuesday
afternoon
when
beneath
a
cloudless
sky
the
great
london
highways
reeked
and
roared
in
celebration
of
jubilee
nancy
and
her
friend
miss
morgan
walked
up
grove
lane
to
champion
hill
here
and
there
a
house
had
decked
itself
with
colours
of
loyalty
otherwise
the
lane
was
as
quiet
as
usual
champion
hill
is
a
gravel
byway
overhung
with
trees
large
houses
and
spacious
gardens
on
either
hand
here
the
heat
of
the
sun
was
tempered
a
carriage
rolled
softly
along
a
nurse
with
children
loitered
in
the
shade
one
might
have
imagined
it
a
country
road
so
profound
the
stillness
and
so
leafy
the
prospect
a
year
ago
jessica
morgan
had
obtained
a
three
months
engagement
as
governess
to
two
little
girls
who
were
sent
under
her
care
to
the
house
of
their
grandmother
at
teignmouth
their
father
mr
vawdrey
of
champion
hill
had
recently
lost
his
wife
through
an
illness
contracted
at
a
where
the
lady
sat
in
wind
and
rain
for
some
hours
the
children
knew
little
of
what
is
learnt
from
books
but
were
surprisingly
well
informed
on
matters
of
which
they
ought
to
have
known
nothing
they
talked
of
theatres
and
of
the
new
murderer
at
tussaud
s
of
of
notorious
spendthrifts
and
discussed
their
acquaintances
with
precocious
understanding
and
repeated
scandalous
insinuations
which
could
have
no
meaning
for
them
jessica
was
supposed
to
teach
them
for
two
hours
daily
she
found
it
an
impossibility
nevertheless
a
liking
grew
up
between
her
and
her
charges
and
save
by
their
refusal
to
study
the
children
gave
her
no
trouble
they
were
abundantly
they
laughed
and
sported
all
day
long
and
did
their
best
to
put
life
into
the
pale
overworked
governess
whilst
living
thus
at
the
seaside
jessica
was
delighted
by
the
arrival
of
nancy
lord
who
came
to
teignmouth
for
a
summer
holiday
with
her
came
mary
woodruff
the
faithful
servant
had
been
ill
mr
lord
sent
her
down
into
devon
to
make
a
complete
recovery
and
to
act
as
nancy
s
humble
chaperon
nancy
s
stay
was
for
three
weeks
the
friends
saw
a
great
deal
of
each
other
and
miss
lord
had
the
honour
of
being
presented
to
tarrant
the
old
lady
with
whom
jessica
lived
vawdrey
s
at
the
age
of
three
score
and
ten
tarrant
still
led
an
active
life
and
talked
with
great
volubility
chiefly
of
herself
nancy
learnt
from
her
that
she
had
been
married
at
seventeen
and
had
had
two
children
a
son
and
a
daughter
both
deceased
of
relatives
there
remained
to
her
only
mr
vawdrey
and
his
family
and
a
grandson
lionel
tarrant
one
evening
as
jessica
returned
from
a
ramble
with
the
children
they
encountered
a
young
man
who
was
greeted
without
much
fervour
as
cousin
tarrant
professed
himself
merely
a
passing
visitant
he
had
come
to
inquire
after
the
health
of
his
grandmother
and
in
a
day
or
two
must
keep
an
appointment
with
friends
elsewhere
notwithstanding
this
announcement
he
remained
at
teignmouth
for
a
fortnight
exhibiting
a
pious
assiduity
in
his
attendance
upon
the
old
lady
naturally
he
made
acquaintance
with
miss
lord
whom
his
cousins
regarded
as
a
great
acquisition
so
vivacious
was
she
so
ready
to
take
part
in
any
kind
of
lively
amusement
tarrant
had
been
at
oxford
his
speech
was
marked
with
the
university
accent
he
talked
little
and
seemed
to
prefer
his
own
society
in
conversation
with
nancy
though
scrupulously
courteous
and
perfectly
he
never
forgot
that
she
was
the
friend
of
his
cousins
governess
that
their
intercourse
must
be
viewed
as
an
irregular
sort
of
thing
and
that
it
behoved
him
to
support
his
dignity
whilst
condescending
to
a
social
inferior
so
at
all
events
it
struck
miss
lord
very
sensitive
in
such
matters
fond
of
fitting
people
with
nicknames
she
called
this
young
man
sometimes
his
royal
highness
sometimes
his
of
tarrant
s
station
in
life
nothing
was
discovered
his
grandmother
though
seemingly
in
possession
of
ample
means
betrayed
an
indifferent
education
and
in
her
flow
of
gossip
never
referred
to
ancestral
dignities
never
made
mention
of
the
calling
her
husband
had
pursued
vawdrey
was
known
to
be
in
business
a
business
which
must
be
tolerably
lucrative
on
their
return
to
london
the
children
passed
from
miss
morgan
s
care
into
that
of
baker
who
kept
house
for
the
widower
at
champion
hill
but
jessica
did
not
wholly
lose
sight
of
them
and
at
their
request
she
persuaded
nancy
lord
to
make
an
occasional
call
with
her
baker
relict
it
was
understood
of
a
military
officer
who
had
fallen
in
eastern
warfare
behaved
to
the
young
ladies
with
much
friendliness
they
did
not
meet
vawdrey
early
in
the
following
year
old
tarrant
forsaking
teignmouth
came
to
live
under
her
s
roof
the
winter
had
tried
her
health
and
henceforth
she
seldom
left
home
as
on
former
occasions
only
two
or
three
in
all
nancy
was
reluctant
to
approach
the
big
house
its
imposing
front
made
her
feel
that
she
came
only
on
sufferance
probably
even
baker
did
not
regard
her
as
having
a
right
to
call
here
on
terms
of
equality
yet
the
place
touched
her
curiosity
and
her
imagination
she
liked
to
study
the
luxurious
appointments
within
and
to
walk
about
the
neglected
but
pleasant
garden
quiet
and
secluded
as
if
whole
counties
divided
it
from
camberwell
in
the
hall
she
and
jessica
were
at
once
welcomed
by
the
children
who
first
informed
them
that
tea
would
be
served
out
of
doors
and
next
made
known
that
cousin
lionel
was
here
in
tarrant
s
the
second
piece
of
news
vexed
nancy
she
resolved
never
to
come
again
unless
on
formal
invitation
baker
an
agreeable
woman
received
them
as
if
she
were
the
mistress
of
the
house
with
jessica
she
chatted
about
matters
examinational
which
she
seemed
thoroughly
to
understand
with
miss
lord
she
talked
of
wider
subjects
in
a
tone
not
unpleasing
to
nancy
seeing
that
it
presumed
on
her
part
some
knowledge
of
the
polite
world
it
was
observable
that
vawdrey
s
daughters
had
benefited
by
the
superintendence
of
this
lady
they
no
longer
gossiped
loudly
about
murders
and
scandals
but
demeaned
themselves
more
as
became
their
years
on
the
arrival
of
other
ladies
to
call
upon
baker
the
children
drew
their
friends
away
into
the
garden
where
tea
now
awaited
them
amid
the
trees
and
flowers
time
passed
not
unpleasantly
until
on
happening
to
turn
her
head
nancy
perceived
at
a
distance
the
approaching
figure
of
lionel
tarrant
he
sauntered
over
the
grass
with
easy
indolent
step
his
straw
hat
and
light
lounge
costume
excellent
tailoring
suited
the
season
and
the
place
jessica
who
regarded
the
young
man
with
something
of
awe
stood
up
to
shake
hands
but
miss
lord
kept
her
place
in
the
garden
chair
did
you
see
the
procession
tarrant
inquired
ah
then
i
can
give
you
very
important
news
thrilling
news
i
know
the
colour
of
the
queen
s
bonnet
and
of
her
please
don
t
keep
us
in
suspense
said
nancy
they
were
of
pale
primrose
touching
don
t
you
think
he
had
seated
himself
crosswise
on
a
and
seemed
to
be
admiring
the
contour
of
his
brown
boots
lionel
s
age
was
not
more
than
he
enjoyed
sound
health
and
his
face
signified
contentment
with
the
scheme
of
things
as
it
concerned
himself
but
a
chronic
languor
possessed
him
it
might
be
sheer
laziness
possibly
a
result
of
that
mental
habit
discernible
in
his
look
whereby
he
had
come
to
regard
his
own
judgment
as
the
criterion
of
all
matters
in
heaven
and
earth
yet
the
conceit
which
relaxed
his
muscles
was
in
the
main
amiable
it
never
repelled
as
does
the
conceit
of
a
fop
or
a
weakling
or
a
vulgar
person
he
could
laugh
heartily
even
with
his
own
affectations
for
a
source
of
amusement
of
personal
vanity
he
had
little
though
women
esteemed
him
his
steady
indolent
gaze
made
denial
of
such
preoccupation
nor
could
he
be
regarded
as
emasculate
his
movements
merely
disguised
the
natural
vigour
of
a
manly
frame
and
his
conversational
trifling
hinted
an
intellectual
reserve
a
latent
power
of
mind
obvious
enough
in
the
lines
of
his
countenance
nancy
was
excusable
for
supposing
that
he
viewed
her
slightingly
he
spoke
as
one
who
did
not
expect
to
be
quite
understood
by
such
a
hearer
addressing
her
without
the
familiarity
much
as
he
addressed
his
young
cousins
to
her
his
careful
observance
of
formalities
seemed
the
reverse
of
flattering
she
felt
sure
that
with
young
women
in
his
own
circle
he
would
allow
himself
much
more
freedom
whether
the
disparagement
applied
to
her
intellect
or
to
her
social
status
might
be
a
question
nancy
could
not
decide
which
of
the
two
she
would
prefer
today
an
especial
uneasiness
troubled
her
from
the
first
moment
of
his
appearance
she
felt
a
stronger
prompting
than
hitherto
to
assert
herself
and
if
possible
to
surprise
tarrant
but
as
if
he
understood
her
thought
his
manner
became
only
more
bland
his
calm
aloofness
more
pronounced
the
children
who
were
never
at
ease
in
their
cousin
s
presence
succeeded
in
drawing
jessica
apart
and
chattered
to
her
about
the
educational
methods
imposed
by
baker
airing
many
grievances
they
nourished
a
hope
that
miss
morgan
might
again
become
their
governess
lessons
down
at
teignmouth
had
been
nothing
like
so
oppressive
as
here
at
champion
hill
tarrant
meanwhile
having
drunk
a
cup
of
tea
and
touched
his
moustache
with
a
silk
handkerchief
transferred
himself
from
the
to
the
basket
chair
vacated
by
jessica
he
was
now
further
from
nancy
but
facing
her
i
have
been
talking
with
bellamy
fell
from
him
in
the
same
tone
of
idle
good
nature
do
you
know
her
she
has
but
one
subject
of
conversation
an
engrossing
topic
to
be
sure
namely
her
servants
do
you
give
much
thought
to
the
great
servant
question
i
have
my
own
modest
view
of
the
matter
it
may
not
be
novel
but
my
mind
has
worked
upon
it
in
the
night
nancy
resolved
not
to
smile
found
herself
smiling
not
so
much
at
what
he
said
as
at
the
manner
of
it
her
resentment
was
falling
away
she
felt
the
influence
of
this
imperturbable
geniality
shall
i
tell
you
my
theory
he
talked
with
less
reserve
than
on
the
last
occasion
when
they
had
sat
together
the
mellow
sunlight
the
garden
odours
the
warm
still
air
favoured
a
growth
of
intimacy
by
all
means
was
nancy
s
reply
we
must
begin
by
admitting
that
the
ordinary
woman
hates
nothing
so
much
as
to
have
another
woman
set
in
authority
over
he
paused
and
laughed
lazily
now
before
the
triumph
of
glorious
democracy
only
those
women
kept
servants
who
were
capable
of
rule
who
had
by
birth
the
instinct
of
authority
they
knew
themselves
the
natural
superiors
of
their
domestics
and
went
through
an
education
fitting
them
to
rule
things
worked
very
well
no
existed
every
woman
who
can
afford
it
must
have
another
woman
to
wait
upon
her
no
matter
how
silly
or
vulgar
or
depraved
she
may
be
the
result
of
course
is
a
spirit
of
rebellion
in
the
kitchen
who
could
have
expected
anything
else
nancy
played
with
a
dandelion
she
had
plucked
and
gave
sign
neither
of
assent
nor
disagreement
mrs
bellamy
continued
the
young
man
marvels
that
servants
revolt
against
her
what
could
be
more
natural
the
servants
have
learnt
that
splendid
doctrine
that
every
one
is
as
good
as
everybody
else
and
bellamy
is
by
no
means
the
person
to
make
them
see
things
differently
and
this
kind
of
thing
is
going
on
in
numberless
houses
an
utterly
incompetent
mistress
and
a
democratic
maid
in
spirited
revolt
the
incompetents
being
in
so
vast
a
majority
will
sooner
or
later
spoil
all
the
servants
in
the
you
should
make
an
article
of
it
said
nancy
and
send
it
to
nineteenth
so
i
he
paused
and
added
casually
you
read
nineteenth
now
and
nancy
felt
herself
an
impostor
for
of
leading
reviews
she
knew
little
more
than
the
names
and
tarrant
s
look
so
steady
yet
so
disturbed
her
conscience
with
the
fear
that
he
saw
through
her
she
was
coming
wretchedly
out
of
this
dialogue
in
which
she
had
meant
to
make
a
figure
he
changed
the
subject
was
it
merely
to
spare
her
shall
you
go
to
teignmouth
again
this
year
i
don
t
know
yet
i
think
silence
followed
tarrant
to
judge
from
his
face
was
absorbed
in
pleasant
thought
nancy
on
the
other
hand
felt
so
ill
at
ease
that
she
was
on
the
point
of
rising
when
his
voice
checked
her
i
have
an
idea
he
spoke
dreamily
of
going
to
spend
next
winter
in
the
why
the
bahamas
speaking
with
all
the
carelessness
she
could
command
nancy
shivered
a
little
spite
of
her
culture
she
had
but
the
vaguest
notion
where
the
bahamas
were
to
betray
ignorance
would
be
dreadful
a
suspicion
awoke
in
her
that
tarrant
surprised
by
her
seeming
familiarity
with
current
literature
was
craftily
testing
the
actual
quality
of
her
education
upon
the
shiver
followed
a
glow
and
in
fear
lest
her
cheeks
would
redden
she
grew
angry
he
was
replying
partly
because
it
is
a
delightful
winter
climate
partly
because
i
have
a
friend
there
partly
because
the
islands
are
interesting
a
man
i
knew
at
oxford
has
gone
out
there
and
is
likely
to
stay
his
father
owns
nearly
the
whole
of
an
island
and
as
he
s
in
very
bad
health
my
friend
may
soon
come
into
possession
when
he
does
he
s
going
to
astonish
the
how
a
vision
of
savages
flashed
before
nancy
s
mind
she
breathed
more
freely
thinking
the
danger
past
simply
by
making
a
fortune
out
of
an
estate
that
is
lying
all
but
barren
before
the
emancipation
of
the
niggers
the
bahamas
flourished
wonderfully
now
they
are
fallen
to
decay
and
ruled
so
far
as
i
understand
it
by
a
particularly
contemptible
crew
of
native
whites
who
ought
all
to
be
kicked
into
the
sea
my
friend
s
father
is
a
man
of
no
energy
he
calls
himself
magistrate
coroner
superintendent
of
the
customs
and
a
dozen
other
things
but
seems
to
have
spent
his
time
for
years
in
lying
about
smoking
and
imbibing
his
son
i
m
afraid
waits
impatiently
for
the
old
man
s
removal
to
a
better
world
he
believes
there
are
immense
possibilities
of
trying
hard
to
recollect
her
geography
miss
lord
affected
but
a
slight
interest
there
s
no
direct
way
of
getting
there
tarrant
pursued
what
route
should
you
suggest
she
was
right
after
all
he
wished
to
convict
her
of
ignorance
her
cheeks
were
now
burning
beyond
a
doubt
and
she
felt
revengeful
i
advise
you
to
make
inquiries
at
a
was
her
distant
reply
it
seems
he
was
smiling
at
nancy
i
shall
have
to
go
to
new
york
and
then
take
the
cuba
are
you
going
to
join
your
friend
in
business
business
i
fear
is
hardly
my
there
was
a
tremor
on
nancy
s
lips
and
about
her
eyelids
she
said
abruptly
i
thought
you
were
perhaps
in
business
did
you
what
suggested
it
tarrant
looked
fixedly
at
her
in
his
expression
as
in
his
voice
she
detected
a
slight
disdain
and
that
decided
her
to
the
utterance
of
the
next
words
oh
she
had
assumed
an
ingenuous
air
there
s
the
black
lead
that
bears
your
name
haven
t
you
something
to
do
with
it
she
durst
not
watch
him
but
a
change
of
his
countenance
was
distinctly
perceptible
and
for
the
moment
caused
her
a
keen
gratification
his
eyes
had
widened
his
lips
had
set
themselves
he
looked
at
once
startled
and
mortified
black
lead
the
words
fell
slowly
in
a
voice
unlike
that
she
had
been
hearing
no
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
silence
was
dreadful
nancy
endeavoured
to
rise
but
her
limbs
would
not
do
their
office
then
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
grass
she
became
aware
that
tarrant
himself
had
stood
up
where
are
the
children
he
was
saying
absently
he
descried
them
afar
off
with
miss
morgan
and
began
to
saunter
in
that
direction
as
soon
as
his
back
was
turned
nancy
rose
and
began
to
walk
towards
the
house
in
a
few
moments
jessica
and
the
girls
were
with
her
i
think
we
must
go
she
said
they
entered
and
took
leave
of
baker
who
sat
alone
in
the
did
you
say
to
tarrant
jessica
asked
as
they
came
forth
again
i
didn
t
but
i
suppose
it
doesn
t
nancy
had
thought
of
telling
her
friend
what
she
had
done
of
boasting
that
she
had
asked
the
impossible
question
but
now
she
felt
ashamed
of
herself
and
something
more
than
ashamed
never
again
could
she
enter
this
garden
and
it
seemed
to
her
that
by
a
piece
of
outrageous
of
wanton
folly
she
had
for
ever
excluded
herself
from
the
society
of
all
superior
people
chapter
now
look
at
it
in
this
way
it
s
to
celebrate
the
fiftieth
year
of
the
reign
of
queen
victoria
yes
but
at
the
same
time
and
far
more
it
s
to
celebrate
the
completion
of
fifty
years
of
progress
national
progress
without
precedent
in
the
history
of
mankind
one
may
say
indeed
progress
of
the
human
race
only
think
what
has
been
done
in
this
only
think
of
it
compare
england
now
compare
the
world
with
what
it
was
in
it
takes
away
one
s
breath
thus
samuel
bennett
barmby
as
he
stood
swaying
forward
upon
his
toes
his
boots
creaking
nancy
and
jessica
listened
to
him
they
were
ready
to
start
on
the
evening
s
expedition
but
horace
had
not
yet
come
home
and
on
the
chance
of
his
arrival
they
would
wait
a
few
minutes
longer
i
shall
make
this
the
subject
of
a
paper
for
our
society
next
winter
the
age
of
progress
and
with
special
reference
to
one
particular
the
press
only
think
now
of
the
difference
between
our
newspapers
all
our
periodicals
of
and
those
fifty
years
ago
did
you
ever
really
consider
miss
morgan
what
a
marvellous
thing
one
of
our
great
newspapers
really
is
printed
in
another
way
it
would
make
a
volume
absolutely
a
positive
volume
packed
with
thought
and
information
and
all
for
the
ridiculous
price
of
one
penny
he
laughed
a
high
chuckling
crowing
laugh
the
laugh
of
triumphant
optimism
of
the
man
s
sincerity
there
could
be
no
question
it
beamed
from
his
shining
forehead
his
pointed
nose
glistened
in
his
prominent
eyes
he
had
a
tall
lank
figure
irreproachably
clad
in
a
suit
of
grey
frock
coat
and
waistcoat
revealing
an
expanse
of
white
shirt
his
cuffs
were
magnificent
and
the
hands
worthy
of
them
a
collar
of
remarkable
stiffness
kept
his
head
at
the
proper
level
of
by
the
bye
miss
lord
are
you
aware
that
the
chinese
empire
with
four
million
inhabitants
has
only
daily
papers
positively
only
how
do
you
know
asked
nancy
i
saw
it
stated
in
a
paper
that
helps
one
to
the
difference
between
civilisation
and
barbarism
one
doesn
t
think
clearly
enough
of
common
things
now
that
s
one
of
the
benefits
one
gets
from
carlyle
carlyle
teaches
one
to
see
the
marvellous
in
everyday
life
of
course
in
many
things
i
don
t
agree
with
him
but
i
shall
never
lose
an
opportunity
of
expressing
my
gratitude
to
carlyle
carlyle
and
gurty
yes
carlyle
and
gurty
those
two
authors
are
an
education
in
he
uttered
a
long
ah
and
moved
his
lips
as
if
savouring
a
delicious
morsel
now
here
s
an
interesting
thing
if
all
the
cabs
in
london
were
put
end
to
end
he
paused
between
the
words
gravely
what
do
you
think
miss
morgan
would
be
the
total
length
oh
i
have
no
idea
forty
miles
positively
forty
miles
of
cabs
how
do
you
know
asked
nancy
i
saw
it
stated
in
a
the
girls
glanced
at
each
other
and
smiled
barmby
beamed
upon
them
with
the
benevolence
of
a
man
who
knew
his
advantages
personal
and
social
and
at
this
moment
horace
lord
came
in
he
had
not
the
fresh
appearance
which
usually
distinguished
him
his
face
was
stained
with
perspiration
his
collar
had
become
limp
the
flower
at
his
buttonhole
hung
faded
well
here
i
am
are
you
going
i
suppose
you
know
you
have
kept
us
waiting
said
his
sister
awf
ly
sorry
couldn
t
get
here
he
spoke
as
if
he
had
not
altogether
the
command
of
his
tongue
and
with
a
fixed
meaningless
smile
we
had
better
not
delay
said
barmby
taking
up
his
hat
seven
o
clock
we
ought
to
be
at
charing
cross
before
eight
that
will
allow
us
about
three
they
set
forth
at
once
by
private
agreement
between
the
girls
jessica
morgan
attached
herself
to
barmby
allowing
nancy
to
follow
with
her
brother
as
they
walked
rapidly
towards
camberwell
green
horace
kept
humming
popular
airs
his
hat
had
fallen
a
little
to
the
side
and
he
swung
his
cane
carelessly
his
sister
asked
him
what
he
had
been
doing
all
day
oh
going
about
i
met
some
fellows
after
the
procession
we
had
a
splendid
view
up
there
on
the
top
of
waterloo
did
fanny
go
home
we
met
her
sisters
and
had
some
lunch
at
a
restaurant
look
here
you
don
t
want
me
you
won
t
mind
if
i
get
lost
in
the
crowd
barmby
will
be
quite
enough
to
take
care
of
you
are
going
to
meet
her
again
i
suppose
horace
nodded
we
had
better
agree
on
a
rendezvous
at
a
certain
time
i
say
barmby
just
a
moment
if
any
of
us
should
get
separated
we
had
better
know
where
to
meet
for
coming
oh
there
s
no
fear
of
all
the
same
it
happen
there
ll
be
a
tremendous
crush
you
know
suppose
we
say
the
place
where
the
trams
stop
south
of
westminster
bridge
and
the
time
a
quarter
to
eleven
this
was
agreed
upon
at
camberwell
green
they
mingled
with
a
confused
rush
of
hilarious
crowds
amid
a
clattering
of
cabs
and
omnibuses
a
jingling
of
bells
sent
forth
their
alcoholic
odours
upon
the
hot
air
samuel
barmby
joyous
in
his
protectorship
of
two
young
ladies
for
he
regarded
horace
as
a
mere
boy
bustled
about
them
whilst
they
stood
waiting
for
the
arrival
of
the
westminster
car
it
ll
have
to
be
a
gallant
rush
you
would
rather
be
outside
wouldn
t
you
miss
lord
here
it
comes
charge
but
the
charge
was
ineffectual
for
their
purpose
a
throng
of
far
more
resolute
and
more
sinewy
people
swept
them
aside
and
seized
every
vacant
place
on
the
top
of
the
vehicle
only
with
much
struggle
did
they
obtain
places
within
in
an
ordinary
mood
nancy
would
have
resented
this
hustling
of
her
person
by
the
profane
public
as
it
was
she
half
enjoyed
the
tumult
and
looked
forward
to
get
more
of
it
along
the
packed
streets
with
a
sense
that
she
might
as
well
amuse
herself
in
vulgar
ways
since
nothing
better
was
attainable
this
did
not
however
modify
her
contempt
of
samuel
barmby
it
seemed
never
to
have
occurred
to
him
that
the
might
be
avoided
and
time
gained
by
the
simple
expedient
of
taking
a
cab
sitting
opposite
to
samuel
she
avoided
his
persistent
glances
by
reading
the
rows
of
advertisements
above
his
head
somebody
s
blue
somebody
s
soap
somebody
s
jams
and
behold
inserted
between
the
soap
and
the
jam
god
so
loved
the
world
that
he
gave
his
son
that
whoso
believeth
in
him
should
not
perish
but
have
everlasting
nancy
perused
the
passage
without
perception
of
incongruity
without
emotion
of
any
kind
her
religion
had
long
since
fallen
to
pieces
and
universal
defilement
of
scriptural
phrase
by
the
associations
of
the
had
in
this
respect
blunted
her
sensibilities
barmby
was
talking
to
jessica
morgan
she
caught
his
words
now
and
then
can
you
tell
me
what
is
the
smallest
tree
in
the
world
no
it
s
the
greenland
birch
its
height
is
only
three
inches
positively
but
it
spreads
over
several
nancy
was
tempted
to
lean
forward
and
say
how
do
you
know
but
the
jest
seemed
to
involve
her
in
too
much
familiarity
with
mr
barmby
for
her
own
peace
it
was
better
to
treat
him
with
all
possible
coldness
a
woman
near
her
talked
loudly
about
the
procession
with
special
reference
to
a
personage
whom
she
called
prince
of
this
enthusiast
declared
with
pride
that
she
had
stood
at
a
certain
street
corner
for
seven
hours
accompanied
by
a
child
of
five
years
old
the
same
who
now
sat
on
her
lap
nodding
in
utter
weariness
together
they
were
going
to
see
the
illuminations
and
walk
about
with
intervals
devoted
to
refreshments
for
several
hours
more
beyond
sat
a
overtaken
with
liquor
who
railed
vehemently
at
the
jubilee
and
in
no
measured
terms
gave
his
opinion
of
our
sovereign
lady
the
whole
thing
was
a
lay
an
occasion
for
filling
the
royal
pocket
and
it
had
succeeded
to
the
tune
of
something
like
half
a
million
of
money
wheedled
most
of
it
from
the
imbecile
poor
shut
up
roared
a
loyalist
whose
patience
could
endure
no
longer
we
re
not
going
to
let
a
boozing
blackguard
like
you
talk
in
that
way
about
er
majesty
thereupon
retort
of
insult
challenge
to
combat
clamour
from
many
throats
deep
and
shrill
nancy
laughed
and
would
rather
have
enjoyed
it
if
the
men
had
fought
at
westminster
bridge
all
jumped
confusedly
into
the
street
and
ran
for
the
pavement
it
was
still
broad
daylight
the
sun
a
potentate
who
keeps
no
jubilee
dropping
westward
amid
the
hues
of
summer
eventide
was
unmarked
for
all
his
splendour
by
the
roaring
multitudes
where
are
you
going
to
leave
us
nancy
inquired
of
her
brother
charing
cross
or
somewhere
about
keep
by
me
till
barmby
was
endeavouring
to
secure
her
companionship
he
began
to
cross
the
bridge
at
her
side
but
nancy
turned
and
bade
him
attend
upon
miss
morgan
saying
that
she
wished
to
talk
with
her
brother
in
this
order
they
moved
towards
parliament
street
where
the
crowd
began
to
thicken
now
let
us
decide
upon
our
route
exclaimed
barmby
with
the
air
of
a
popular
leader
planning
a
great
demonstration
miss
lord
we
will
be
directed
by
your
wishes
where
would
you
like
to
be
when
the
begins
i
don
t
care
what
does
it
matter
let
us
go
straight
on
and
see
whatever
comes
in
our
that
s
the
right
spirit
let
us
give
ourselves
up
to
the
occasion
we
can
t
be
wrong
in
making
for
trafalgar
square
advance
they
followed
upon
a
group
of
reeling
lads
and
girls
who
yelled
in
chorus
the
popular
song
of
the
day
a
sentimental
one
as
it
happened
not
forget
me
do
not
forget
me
think
sometimes
of
me
nancy
was
working
herself
into
a
nervous
excited
state
she
felt
it
impossible
to
walk
on
and
on
under
barmby
s
protection
listening
to
his
atrocious
commonplaces
his
enthusiasms
of
the
young
men
s
debating
society
the
glow
of
midsummer
had
entered
into
her
blood
she
resolved
to
taste
independence
to
mingle
with
the
limitless
crowd
as
one
of
its
units
borne
in
whatever
direction
that
song
of
the
streets
pleased
her
made
sympathetic
appeal
to
her
she
would
have
liked
to
join
in
it
just
behind
her
it
was
on
the
broad
pavement
at
whitehall
some
one
spoke
her
name
miss
lord
why
who
would
have
expected
to
see
you
here
shouldn
t
have
dared
to
think
of
such
a
thing
upon
my
word
i
shouldn
t
a
man
of
about
thirty
dressed
without
much
care
wiry
ruddy
of
cheek
and
his
coarse
but
strong
features
vivid
with
festive
energy
held
a
hand
to
her
luckworth
crewe
was
his
name
nancy
had
come
to
know
him
at
the
house
of
peachey
where
from
time
to
time
she
had
met
various
people
unrecognised
in
her
own
home
his
tongue
bewrayed
him
for
a
native
of
some
northern
county
his
manner
had
no
polish
but
a
genuine
heartiness
which
would
have
atoned
for
many
defects
horace
who
also
knew
him
offered
a
friendly
greeting
but
samuel
barmby
when
the
voice
caught
his
ear
regarded
this
intruder
with
cold
surprise
may
i
walk
on
with
you
crewe
asked
when
he
saw
that
miss
lord
felt
no
distaste
for
his
company
nancy
deigned
not
even
a
glance
at
her
nominal
protector
if
you
are
going
our
way
she
replied
barmby
his
dignity
unobserved
strode
on
with
miss
morgan
of
whom
he
sought
information
concerning
the
man
crewe
talked
away
so
you
ve
come
out
to
have
a
look
at
it
after
all
i
saw
the
miss
frenches
last
sunday
and
they
told
me
you
cared
no
more
for
the
jubilee
than
for
a
of
course
i
wasn
t
surprised
you
ve
other
things
to
think
about
but
it
s
worth
seeing
that
s
my
opinion
were
you
out
this
morning
no
i
don
t
care
for
no
more
do
i
expensive
humbugs
that
s
what
i
call
em
but
i
had
a
look
at
them
for
all
that
the
crown
prince
was
worth
seeing
yes
he
really
was
i
m
not
so
prejudiced
as
to
deny
that
he
s
the
kind
of
chap
i
should
like
to
get
hold
of
and
have
a
bit
of
a
talk
with
and
ask
him
what
he
thought
about
things
in
general
it
s
been
a
big
affair
hasn
t
it
i
know
a
chap
who
made
a
jubilee
perfume
and
he
s
netting
something
like
a
hundred
pounds
a
have
you
any
jubilee
speculation
on
hand
don
t
ask
me
it
makes
me
mad
i
had
a
really
big
thing
a
jubilee
drink
a
teetotal
beverage
the
kind
of
thing
that
would
have
sold
itself
this
weather
a
friend
of
mine
hit
on
it
a
clerk
in
a
city
warehouse
one
of
the
cleverest
chaps
i
ever
knew
it
really
was
drink
i
ve
never
tasted
anything
like
it
why
there
s
the
biggest
fortune
on
record
waiting
for
the
man
who
can
supply
drink
for
and
this
friend
of
mine
had
it
he
gave
me
some
to
taste
one
night
about
a
month
ago
and
i
roared
with
delight
it
was
all
arranged
i
undertook
to
find
enough
capital
to
start
with
and
to
manage
the
concern
i
would
have
given
up
my
work
with
bullock
and
freeman
i
d
have
gone
in
tooth
and
nail
for
that
drink
i
sat
up
all
one
night
trying
to
find
a
name
for
it
but
couldn
t
hit
on
the
right
one
a
name
is
just
as
important
as
the
stuff
itself
that
you
want
to
sell
next
morning
it
was
sunday
i
went
round
to
my
friend
s
lodgings
and
he
slapped
his
thigh
i
m
blest
if
the
chap
hadn
t
cut
his
throat
why
betting
and
forgery
he
would
have
been
arrested
next
day
but
the
worst
of
it
was
that
his
beverage
perished
with
him
i
hadn
t
a
notion
how
it
was
made
he
wouldn
t
tell
me
till
i
planked
down
money
to
start
with
and
not
a
drop
of
it
could
be
found
anywhere
and
to
think
that
he
had
absolutely
struck
oil
as
they
say
had
nothing
to
do
but
sit
down
and
count
the
money
as
it
came
in
that
s
the
third
man
i
ve
known
go
wrong
in
less
than
a
year
betting
and
embezzlement
betting
and
burglary
betting
and
forgery
i
ll
tell
you
some
time
about
the
chap
who
went
in
for
burglary
one
of
the
best
fellows
i
ever
knew
when
he
comes
out
i
must
give
him
a
hand
but
ten
to
one
he
ll
burgle
again
they
always
do
burglary
grows
on
a
man
like
his
laughter
rang
across
the
street
barmby
who
kept
looking
back
surprised
and
indignant
that
this
acquaintance
of
miss
lord
s
was
not
presented
to
him
paused
for
a
moment
but
nancy
waved
to
him
commandingly
straight
on
they
reached
charing
cross
horace
who
took
no
part
in
the
conversation
and
had
dropped
behind
at
this
point
found
an
opportunity
of
stealing
away
it
was
crewe
who
first
remarked
his
absence
hollo
where
s
your
brother
gone
hush
don
t
say
anything
will
you
do
something
for
me
crewe
of
course
i
will
what
is
it
nancy
pursued
in
a
low
voice
he
s
gone
to
meet
fanny
french
at
least
he
told
me
so
but
i
want
to
know
whether
it
is
really
fanny
or
some
one
else
he
said
they
were
to
meet
in
front
of
the
haymarket
theatre
will
you
go
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
see
if

laughed
like
a
bird
but
how

i
to
meet

ll
be
at
the
top
of
regent
street
at
nine
o
clock
by
peter
robinson
s
don
t
lose
he
struck
off
in
the
westerly
direction
and
barmby
looking
round
at
that
moment
saw
him
go
engrossed
in
thought
of
nancy
samuel
did
not
yet
perceive
that
her
brother
had
vanished
your
friend
isn
t
coming
any
further
he
said
in
a
tone
of
forbearance
but
where
s
lord
exclaimed
jessica
nancy
pretended
to
look
back
for
him
and
for
a
minute
or
two
they
waited
barmby
glad
to
be
delivered
from
both
male
companions
made
light
of
the
matter
horace
could
take
care
of
himself
they
had
the
appointment
for
a
quarter
to
eleven
on
and
he
now
fixed
himself
resolutely
at
nancy
s
side
she
delighted
with
the
success
of
her
stratagem
and
careless
of
what
might
result
from
it
behaved
more
companionably
to
luckworth
crewe
s
society
she
had
no
objection
indeed
she
rather
liked
him
but
his
presence
would
have
hindered
the
escape
for
which
she
was
preparing
poor
jessica
might
feel
it
something
of
a
hardship
to
pass
hours
alone
with
the
prophet
but
that
could
not
be
helped
nancy
would
be
free
if
never
again
they
turned
into
the
strand
and
barmby
voiced
his
opinion
of
the
public
decorations
there
s
very
little
of
what
can
be
called
art
very
little
indeed
i
m
afraid
we
haven
t
made
much
progress
in
now
what
would
ruskin
say
to
this
kind
of
thing
the
popular
taste
wants
educating
my
idea
is
that
we
ought
to
get
a
few
leading
men
burne
jones
and
and
william
morris
and
people
of
that
kind
you
know
miss
lord
to
give
lectures
in
a
big
hall
on
the
elements
of
art
a
great
deal
might
be
done
in
that
way
don
t
you
think
so
miss
morgan
i
have
no
faith
in
anything
popular
jessica
replied
loftily
no
no
but
after
all
the
people
have
got
the
upper
hand
and
we
who
enjoy
advantages
of
education
of
culture
ought
not
to
allow
them
to
remain
in
darkness
it
isn
t
for
our
own
interest
most
decidedly
it
isn
did
your
sisters
go
to
see
the
procession
nancy
asked
oh
they
were
afraid
of
the
crowd
the
old
gentleman
took
them
out
to
tooting
common
this
afternoon
and
they
enjoyed
themselves
perhaps
i
should
have
been
wiser
if
i
had
imitated
their
example
i
mean
this
morning
of
course
i
wouldn
t
have
missed
this
evening
for
anything
whatever
but
somehow
one
feels
it
a
sort
of
duty
to
see
something
of
these
great
public
holidays
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
procession
in
its
way
it
was
imposing
yes
really
after
all
the
monarchy
is
a
great
as
gurty
would
have
said
i
like
to
keep
my
mind
open
to
the
sun
had
set
and
with
approach
of
dusk
the
crowds
grew
denser
nancy
proposed
a
return
westwards
the
clubs
of
pall
mall
and
of
st
james
s
street
would
make
a
display
worth
seeing
and
they
must
not
miss
piccadilly
a
little
later
said
their
escort
with
an
air
of
liberality
we
must
think
of
some
light
refreshment
we
shall
be
passing
a
respectable
restaurant
no
twilight
began
to
obscure
the
distance
here
and
there
a
slowly
marked
itself
with
points
of
flame
shaping
to
wreath
festoon
or
initials
of
royalty
nancy
looked
eagerly
about
her
impatient
for
the
dark
wishing
the
throng
would
sweep
her
away
in
pall
mall
barmby
felt
it
incumbent
upon
him
to
name
the
several
clubs
a
task
for
which
he
was
inadequately
prepared
as
he
stood
staring
in
doubt
at
one
of
the
coldly
insolent
facades
jessica
gazing
in
the
same
direction
nancy
saw
that
her
moment
had
come
she
darted
off
struggled
through
a
moving
crowd
and
reached
the
opposite
pavement
all
she
had
now
to
do
was
to
press
onward
with
the
people
around
her
save
by
chance
she
could
not
possibly
be
discovered
alarm
at
her
daring
troubled
her
for
a
few
minutes
as
a
matter
of
course
barmby
would
report
this
incident
to
her
father
unless
she
plainly
asked
him
not
to
do
so
for
which
she
had
no
mind
yet
what
did
it
matter
she
had
escaped
to
enjoy
herself
and
the
sense
of
freedom
soon
overcame
anxieties
no
one
observed
her
solitary
state
she
was
one
of
millions
walking
about
the
streets
because
it
was
jubilee
day
and
every
moment
packed
her
more
tightly
among
the
tramping
populace
a
procession
this
greatly
more
significant
than
that
of
royal
personages
earlier
in
the
day
along
the
main
thoroughfares
of
was
now
suspended
between
the
houses
moved
a
double
current
of
humanity
this
way
and
that
filling
the
whole
space
so
that
no
vehicle
could
possibly
have
made
its
way
on
the
wonted
track
at
junctions
pickets
of
police
directed
progress
the
slowly
advancing
masses
wheeled
to
left
or
right
at
word
of
command
carelessly
obedient
but
for
an
occasional
bellow
of
hilarious
blackguardism
or
for
a
song
uplifted
by
strident
voices
or
a
cheer
at
some
flaring
symbol
that
pleased
the
passers
there
was
little
noise
only
a
thud
thud
of
footfalls
numberless
and
the
low
unvarying
sound
that
suggested
some
huge
beast
purring
to
itself
in
stupid
contentment
nancy
forgot
her
identity
lost
sight
of
herself
as
an
individual
her
blood
was
heated
by
close
air
and
physical
contact
she
did
not
think
and
her
emotions
differed
little
from
those
of
any
let
loose
the
culture
to
which
she
laid
claim
evanesced
in
this
atmosphere
of
exhalations
could
she
have
seen
her
face
its
look
of
vulgar
abandonment
would
have
horrified
her
some
one
trod
violently
on
her
heel
and
she
turned
with
a
laugh
protesting
beg
your
pardon
miss
said
a
young
fellow
of
the
clerkly
order
a
push
be
ind
made
me
do
he
thrust
himself
to
a
place
beside
her
and
nancy
conversed
with
him
unrestrainedly
as
though
it
were
a
matter
of
course
the
young
man
scrutinising
her
with
much
freedom
shaped
clerkly
compliments
and
in
his
fashion
grew
lyrical
until
at
a
certain
remark
which
he
permitted
himself
nancy
felt
it
time
to
shake
him
off
her
next
encounter
was
more
noteworthy
of
a
sudden
she
felt
an
arm
round
her
waist
and
a
man
whose
breath
declared
the
source
of
his
inspiration
began
singing
close
to
her
ear
the
operatic
ditty
queen
of
my
he
had
moreover
a
good
tenor
voice
and
belonged
vaguely
to
some
stratum
of
educated
society
i
think
you
had
better
leave
me
alone
said
nancy
looking
him
severely
in
the
face
well
if
you
really
think
so
he
seemed
struck
by
her
manner
of
speech
of
course
i
will
but
i
d
much
rather
i
might
find
it
necessary
to
speak
to
a
policeman
at
the
next
oh
in
that
he
raised
his
hat
and
fell
aside
and
nancy
felt
that
after
all
the
adventure
had
been
amusing
she
was
now
in
regent
street
and
it
came
to
her
recollection
that
she
had
made
an
appointment
with
luckworth
crewe
for
nine
o
clock
without
any
intention
of
keeping
it
but
why
not
do
so
her
lively
acquaintance
would
be
excellent
company
for
the
next
hour
until
she
chose
to
bring
the
escapade
to
an
end
and
indeed
save
by
a
disagreeable
struggle
she
could
hardly
change
the
direction
of
her
steps
it
was
probably
past
nine
crewe
might
have
got
tired
of
waiting
or
have
found
it
impossible
to
keep
a
position
on
the
pavement
drawing
near
to
the
top
of
regent
street
she
hoped
he
might
be
there
and
there
he
was
jovially
perspiring
he
saw
her
between
crowded
heads
and
crushed
through
to
her
side
chapter
where
are
your
friends
that
s
more
than
i
can
tell
they
laughed
together
it
s
a
miracle
we
ve
been
able
to
meet
said
crewe
i
had
to
thrash
a
fellow
five
minutes
ago
and
was
precious
near
getting
run
in
shall
we
go
the
tottenham
court
road
way
look
out
you
d
better
hold
on
to
my
arm
these
big
crossings
are
like
whirlpools
you
might
go
round
and
round
and
never
get
anywhere
don
t
be
afraid
if
any
one
runs
up
against
you
i
ll
knock
him
there
wouldn
t
be
room
for
him
to
fall
said
nancy
wild
with
merriment
as
they
swayed
amid
the
uproar
for
the
first
time
she
understood
how
perilous
such
a
crowd
might
be
a
band
of
roisterers
linked
arm
in
arm
were
trying
to
break
up
the
orderly
march
of
thousands
into
a
chaotic
fight
the
point
for
which
crewe
made
was
unattainable
just
in
front
of
him
a
woman
began
shrieking
hysterically
another
fainted
and
dropped
into
her
neighbour
s
arms
don
t
get
frightened
not
i
i
like
it
it
s
good
you
re
the
right
sort
you
are
but
we
must
get
out
of
this
it
s
worse
than
the
on
the
first
night
of
a
pantomime
i
must
hold
you
up
don
t
his
arm
encircled
her
body
and
for
a
moment
now
and
then
he
carried
rather
than
led
her
they
were
safe
at
length
in
the
right
part
of
oxford
street
and
moving
with
the
stream
i
couldn
t
find
your
brother
crewe
had
leisure
to
say
and
i
didn
t
see
fanny
french
there
weren
t
many
people
about
just
then
either
they
must
have
gone
off
before
i
yes
they
must
it
doesn
t
you
have
some
life
in
he
gazed
at
her
admiringly
you
re
worth
half
a
million
of
the
girls
that
squeak
and
wobble
when
there
s
a
bit
of
rough
play
going
i
hope
so
did
you
set
me
down
as
one
of
that
kind
nancy
found
that
her
tongue
had
achieved
a
liberty
suitable
to
the
occasion
she
spoke
without
forethought
and
found
pleasure
in
her
boldness
not
i
crewe
answered
but
i
never
had
a
chance
before
now
of
telling
you
what
i
some
one
in
front
of
them
ignited
a
bengal
light
and
threw
it
into
the
air
the
flame
flashed
across
nancy
s
features
and
fell
upon
the
hat
of
a
man
near
her
how
do
you
mean
to
get
home
asked
crewe
presently
nancy
explained
that
all
her
party
were
to
meet
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
oh
then
there
s
plenty
of
time
when
you
ve
had
enough
of
this
kind
of
thing
we
can
strike
off
into
the
quiet
streets
if
you
were
a
man
which
i
m
glad
you
re
not
i
should
say
i
was
choking
for
a
glass
of
say
it
and
look
for
a
place
where
you
can
quench
your
it
must
be
a
place
then
where
you
can
come
in
as
well
you
don
t
drink
beer
of
course
but
we
can
get
lemonade
and
that
kind
of
thing
no
wonder
we
get
thirsty
look
up
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
nancy
saw
above
the
heads
of
the
multitude
a
waving
sent
up
by
myriad
tramplings
on
the
streets
glare
of
gas
illumined
it
in
the
foreground
beyond
it
dimmed
all
radiance
like
a
thin
fog
we
might
cut
across
through
soho
he
pursued
and
get
among
the
restaurants
take
my
arm
again
only
a
bit
of
and
we
shall
be
in
the
crowd
going
the
other
way
did
you
do
physics
at
school
remember
about
the
resultant
of
forces
now
re
a
force
tending
to
the
right
and
the
crowd
is
a
force
making
for
straight
on
to
find
the
his
hat
was
knocked
over
his
eyes
and
the
statement
of
the
problem
ended
in
laughter
with
a
good
deal
of
difficulty
they
reached
one
of
the
southward
byways
and
thenceforth
walking
was
unimpeded
you
know
that
i
call
myself
luckworth
crewe
resumed
nancy
s
companion
after
a
short
silence
of
course
i
well
the
fact
is
i
ve
no
right
to
either
of
the
names
i
thought
i
d
just
tell
you
for
the
fun
of
the
thing
i
shouldn
t
talk
about
it
to
any
one
else
that
i
know
they
tell
me
i
was
picked
up
on
a
doorstep
in
leeds
and
the
wife
of
a
adopted
me
their
name
was
crewe
they
called
me
tom
but
somehow
it
isn
t
a
name
i
care
for
and
when
i
was
grown
up
i
met
a
man
called
luckworth
who
was
as
kind
as
a
father
to
me
and
so
i
took
his
name
in
place
of
tom
that
s
the
long
and
short
of
nancy
looked
a
trifle
disconcerted
you
won
t
think
any
worse
of
me
because
i
haven
t
a
name
of
my
own
why
should
i
it
isn
t
your
no
but
i
m
not
the
kind
of
man
to
knuckle
under
i
think
myself
just
as
good
as
anybody
else
i
ll
knock
the
man
down
that
sneers
at
me
and
i
won
t
thank
anybody
for
pitying
me
that
s
the
sort
of
chap
i
am
and
i
m
going
to
have
a
big
fortune
one
of
these
days
it
s
down
in
the
books
i
know
i
shall
live
to
be
a
rich
man
just
as
well
as
i
know
that
i
m
walking
down
dean
street
with
miss
i
should
think
it
very
possible
his
companion
remarked
it
hasn
t
begun
yet
i
can
only
lay
my
hand
on
a
few
hundred
pounds
one
way
and
another
and
i
m
turned
thirty
but
the
next
ten
years
are
going
to
do
it
do
you
know
what
i
did
last
saturday
i
got
fifteen
hundred
pounds
worth
of
advertising
for
our
people
from
a
chap
that
s
never
yet
put
a
penny
into
the
hands
of
an
agent
i
went
down
and
talked
to
him
like
a
father
he
was
the
hardest
nut
i
ever
had
to
crack
but
in
minutes
i
d
got
him
like
a
roach
on
a
hook
and
it
ll
be
to
his
advantage
mind
you
that
fifteen
hundred
ll
bring
him
in
more
business
than
he
s
had
for
ten
years
past
i
got
him
to
confess
he
was
going
down
the
hill
of
course
i
said
because
you
don
t
know
how
to
advertise
and
won
t
let
anybody
else
know
for
you
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
telling
me
he
d
dropped
more
than
a
thousand
on
a
patent
that
was
out
of
date
before
it
got
fairly
going
all
right
said
i
here
s
your
new
you
ve
dropped
a
thousand
on
the
other
thing
give
your
advertising
to
us
and
i
ll
guarantee
you
shall
come
home
on
the
come
home
on
it
nancy
inquired
in
astonishment
oh
it
s
our
way
of
talking
said
the
other
with
his
hearty
laugh
it
means
to
make
up
one
s
loss
and
he
ll
do
it
and
when
he
has
he
ll
think
no
end
of
i
not
long
ago
i
boxed
a
chap
for
his
advertising
a
fair
with
the
gloves
do
you
suppose
i
licked
him
not
i
though
i
could
have
done
it
with
one
hand
i
just
let
him
knock
me
out
of
time
and
two
minutes
after
he
put
all
his
business
into
my
oh
you
ll
get
rich
declared
nancy
laughing
no
doubt
about
there
was
a
spot
down
the
south
western
railway
where
we
wanted
to
stick
up
a
board
a
great
big
board
as
ugly
as
they
make
em
it
was
in
a
man
s
garden
a
certain
particular
place
where
the
trains
slow
and
folks
have
time
to
read
the
advertisement
and
meditate
on
it
that
chap
wouldn
t
listen
what
spoil
his
garden
with
our
da
with
our
confounded
board
not
for
five
hundred
a
year
well
i
went
down
and
i
talked
to
him
like
a
father
put
in
nancy
just
so
like
a
father
look
here
said
i
my
dear
sir
you
re
impeding
the
progress
of
civilisation
how
could
we
have
become
what
we
are
without
the
modern
science
and
art
of
advertising
till
advertising
sprang
up
the
world
was
barbarous
do
you
suppose
people
kept
themselves
clean
before
they
were
reminded
at
every
corner
of
the
benefits
of
soap
do
you
suppose
they
were
healthy
before
every
wall
and
hoarding
told
them
what
medicine
to
take
for
their
ailments
not
they
indeed
why
a
man
like
you
an
enlightened
man
i
see
it
in
your
face
he
was
as
ugly
as
ben
s
ought
to
be
proud
of
helping
on
the
and
i
made
him
downright
ashamed
of
himself
he
asked
me
to
have
a
bit
of
dinner
and
we
came
to
terms
over
the
in
this
strain
did
luckworth
crewe
continue
to
talk
across
the
gloomy
solitudes
of
soho
and
nancy
would
on
no
account
have
had
him
cease
she
was
fascinated
by
his
rough
vigour
and
by
his
visions
of
golden
prosperity
it
seemed
to
her
that
they
reached
very
quickly
the
restaurant
he
had
in
view
with
keen
enjoyment
of
the
novelty
she
followed
him
between
tables
where
people
were
eating
drinking
smoking
and
took
a
place
beside
him
on
a
cushioned
seat
at
the
end
of
the
room
i
know
you
re
tired
he
said
there
s
nearly
before
you
need
nancy
hesitated
in
her
choice
of
a
refreshment
she
wished
to
have
something
unusual
something
that
fitted
an
occasion
so
remarkable
yet
as
crewe
would
of
course
pay
she
did
not
like
to
propose
anything
expensive
now
let
me
choose
for
you
her
companion
requested
after
all
that
rough
work
you
want
something
more
than
a
drop
of
lemonade
i
m
going
to
order
a
nice
little
bottle
of
champagne
out
of
the
ice
and
a
pretty
little
sandwich
made
of
whatever
you
champagne
it
had
been
in
her
thoughts
a
sparkling
audacity
good
champagne
let
it
be
and
she
leaned
back
in
defiant
satisfaction
i
didn
t
expect
much
from
jubilee
day
observed
the
man
of
business
but
that
only
shows
how
things
turn
out
always
better
or
worse
than
you
think
for
i
m
not
likely
to
forget
it
it
s
the
best
day
i
ve
had
in
my
life
yet
and
i
leave
you
to
guess
who
i
owe
i
think
this
is
good
wine
remarked
nancy
as
if
she
had
not
heard
him
not
bad
you
wouldn
t
suppose
a
fellow
of
my
sort
would
know
anything
about
it
but
i
do
i
ve
drunk
plenty
of
good
champagne
and
i
shall
drink
nancy
ate
her
sandwich
and
smiled
the
one
glass
sufficed
her
crewe
drank
three
presently
looking
at
her
with
his
head
propped
on
his
hand
he
said
gravely
i
wonder
whether
this
is
the
last
walk
we
shall
have
together
who
can
say
she
answered
in
a
light
tone
some
one
ought
to
be
able
to
i
never
make
prophecies
and
never
believe
other
people
shows
your
good
sense
but
make
wishes
and
plenty
of
so
do
i
said
nancy
then
let
us
both
make
a
wish
to
ourselves
proposed
crewe
regarding
her
with
eyes
that
had
an
uncommon
light
in
them
his
companion
laughed
then
both
were
quiet
for
a
moment
they
allowed
themselves
plenty
of
time
to
battle
their
way
as
far
as
westminster
bridge
at
one
point
police
and
crowd
were
in
brief
conflict
the
burly
guardians
of
order
dealt
thwacking
blows
right
and
left
sound
fisticuffs
backed
with
hearty
oaths
the
night
was
young
by
magisterial
providence
hours
of
steady
drinking
lay
before
the
hardier
jubilants
thwacks
and
curses
would
be
no
rarity
in
another
hour
or
two
at
the
foot
of
parliament
street
nancy
came
face
to
face
with
samuel
barmby
on
whose
arm
hung
the
wearied
jessica
without
heeding
their
exclamations
she
turned
to
her
protector
and
bade
him
a
hearty
crewe
accepted
his
dismissal
he
made
survey
of
barmby
and
moved
off
singing
to
himself
not
forget
me
do
not
forget
part
ii
nature
s
graduate
chapter
the
disorder
which
stephen
lord
masked
as
a
touch
of
gout
had
in
truth
a
much
more
disagreeable
name
it
was
now
twelve
months
since
his
doctor
s
first
warning
directed
against
the
savoury
meats
and
ardent
beverages
which
constituted
his
diet
stephen
resolved
upon
a
change
of
habits
but
the
flesh
held
him
in
bondage
and
medical
prophecy
was
justified
by
the
event
all
through
jubilee
day
he
suffered
acutely
for
the
rest
of
the
week
he
remained
at
home
sometimes
sitting
in
the
garden
but
generally
keeping
his
room
where
he
lay
on
a
couch
a
man
of
method
and
routine
sedentary
with
a
strong
dislike
of
unfamiliar
surroundings
he
could
not
be
persuaded
to
try
change
of
air
the
disease
intensified
his
native
stubbornness
made
him
by
turns
fretful
and
furious
disposed
him
to
a
sullen
solitude
he
would
accept
no
tendance
but
that
of
mary
woodruff
to
her
as
to
his
children
he
kept
up
the
pretence
of
gout
he
was
visited
only
by
samuel
barmby
with
whom
he
discussed
details
of
business
and
by
barmby
senior
his
friend
of
thirty
years
the
one
man
to
whom
he
unbosomed
himself
his
effort
to
follow
the
regimen
medically
prescribed
to
him
was
even
now
futile
at
the
end
of
a
week
s
time
imagining
himself
somewhat
better
he
resumed
his
daily
walk
to
camberwell
road
but
remained
at
the
warehouse
only
till
two
or
three
o
clock
then
returned
and
sat
alone
in
his
room
on
one
of
the
first
days
of
july
when
the
weather
was
oppressively
hot
he
entered
the
house
about
noon
and
in
a
few
minutes
rang
his
bell
mary
woodruff
came
to
him
he
was
sitting
on
the
couch
pale
wet
with
perspiration
and
exhausted
i
want
something
to
drink
he
said
wearily
without
raising
his
eyes
will
you
have
the
sir
yes
what
you
mary
brought
it
to
him
and
he
drank
two
large
glasses
with
no
pause
where
is
nancy
in
town
sir
she
said
she
would
be
back
about
he
made
an
angry
movement
what
s
she
doing
in
town
she
said
nothing
to
me
why
doesn
t
she
come
back
to
lunch
where
does
she
go
to
for
all
these
hours
i
don
t
know
the
servant
spoke
in
a
low
respectful
voice
looking
at
her
master
with
eyes
that
seemed
to
compassionate
him
well
it
doesn
t
he
waved
a
hand
as
if
in
dismissal
wait
if
i
m
to
be
alone
i
might
as
well
have
lunch
now
i
feel
hungry
as
if
i
hadn
t
eaten
anything
for
hours
get
me
something
later
in
the
afternoon
his
bell
again
sounded
and
mary
answered
it
as
he
did
not
speak
at
once
he
was
standing
by
the
window
with
his
hands
behind
him
she
asked
him
his
pleasure
bring
me
some
water
mary
plain
she
returned
with
a
jug
and
glass
and
he
took
a
long
draught
no
don
t
go
yet
i
want
to
to
talk
to
you
about
things
sit
down
there
for
a
he
pointed
to
the
couch
and
mary
with
an
anxious
look
obeyed
him
i
m
thinking
of
leaving
this
house
and
going
to
live
in
the
country
there
s
no
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
my
partner
can
look
after
the
business
well
it
might
be
the
best
thing
you
could
do
sir
the
best
for
your
yes
it
might
i
m
not
satisfied
with
things
i
want
to
make
a
decided
change
in
every
his
face
had
grown
more
haggard
during
the
last
few
days
and
his
eyes
wandered
expressing
fretfulness
or
fear
he
spoke
with
effort
and
seemed
unable
to
find
the
words
that
would
convey
his
meaning
now
i
want
you
to
tell
me
plainly
what
do
you
think
of
nancy
think
of
her
sir
no
no
don
t
speak
in
that
way
i
don
t
want
you
to
call
me
sir
it
isn
t
necessary
we
ve
known
each
other
so
long
and
i
think
of
you
as
a
friend
a
very
good
friend
think
of
me
in
the
same
way
and
speak
naturally
i
want
to
know
your
opinion
of
the
listener
had
a
face
of
grave
attention
it
signified
no
surprise
no
vulgar
but
perhaps
a
just
perceptible
pleasure
and
in
replying
she
looked
steadily
at
her
master
for
a
moment
i
really
don
t
feel
i
can
judge
her
lord
it
s
true
in
a
way
i
ought
to
know
her
very
well
as
i
ve
seen
her
day
by
day
since
she
was
a
little
thing
but
now
she
s
a
and
clever
young
lady
and
she
has
got
far
beyond
me
ay
there
it
is
there
it
is
stephen
interrupted
with
bitterness
she
s
got
beyond
us
beyond
me
as
well
as
you
and
she
isn
t
what
i
meant
her
to
be
very
far
from
it
i
haven
t
brought
them
up
as
i
wished
i
don
t
know
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
why
it
was
in
own
hands
when
they
were
little
children
i
said
to
myself
hey
shall
grow
up
plain
good
honest
girl
and
boy
i
said
that
i
wouldn
t
educate
them
very
much
i
saw
little
good
that
came
of
it
in
our
rank
of
life
i
meant
them
to
be
i
hoped
nancy
would
marry
a
plain
countryman
like
the
men
i
used
to
know
when
i
was
a
boy
a
farmer
or
something
of
that
kind
but
see
how
it
s
come
about
it
wasn
t
that
i
altered
my
mind
about
what
was
best
but
i
seemed
to
have
no
choice
for
one
thing
i
made
more
money
at
business
than
i
had
expected
and
so
and
so
it
seemed
that
they
ought
to
be
educated
above
me
and
mine
there
was
my
mother
did
a
better
woman
ever
live
she
had
no
education
but
that
of
home
she
could
have
brought
up
nancy
in
the
good
way
if
i
had
let
her
i
wish
i
had
yes
i
wish
i
i
don
t
think
you
could
have
felt
satisfied
said
the
listener
with
intelligent
sympathy
why
not
if
she
had
been
as
good
and
useful
a
woman
as
are
ah
you
mustn
t
think
in
that
way
lord
i
was
born
and
bred
to
service
your
daughter
had
a
mind
given
her
at
her
birth
that
would
never
have
been
content
with
humble
things
she
was
meant
for
education
and
a
higher
what
higher
place
is
there
for
her
she
thinks
herself
too
good
for
the
life
she
leads
here
and
yet
i
don
t
believe
she
ll
ever
find
a
place
among
people
of
a
higher
class
she
has
told
me
herself
it
s
my
fault
she
says
i
ought
to
have
had
a
big
house
for
her
so
that
she
might
make
friends
among
the
rich
perhaps
she
s
right
i
have
made
her
neither
one
thing
nor
another
mary
if
i
had
never
come
to
london
i
might
have
lived
happily
my
place
was
away
there
in
the
old
home
i
ve
known
that
for
many
a
year
i
ve
thought
wait
till
i
ve
made
a
little
more
money
and
i
ll
go
back
but
it
was
never
done
and
now
it
looks
to
me
as
if
i
had
spoilt
the
lives
of
my
children
as
well
as
my
own
i
can
t
trust
nancy
that
s
the
worst
of
it
you
don
t
know
what
she
did
on
jubilee
night
she
wasn
t
with
barmby
and
the
others
barmby
told
me
about
it
she
pretended
to
lose
them
and
went
off
somewhere
to
meet
a
man
she
s
never
spoken
to
me
about
is
that
how
a
good
girl
would
act
i
didn
t
speak
to
her
about
it
what
use
very
likely
she
wouldn
t
tell
me
the
truth
she
takes
it
for
granted
i
can
t
understand
her
she
thinks
her
education
puts
her
above
all
plain
folk
and
their
ways
that
s
mary
s
eyes
had
fallen
and
she
kept
silence
suppose
anything
happened
to
me
and
they
were
left
to
themselves
i
have
money
to
leave
between
them
and
of
course
they
know
it
how
could
it
do
them
anything
but
harm
do
you
know
that
horace
wants
to
marry
that
girl
fanny
french
a
grinning
chattering
fool
if
not
worse
he
has
told
me
he
shall
do
as
he
likes
whether
or
no
it
was
right
to
educate
nancy
i
am
very
sure
that
i
ought
to
have
done
with
as
i
meant
at
first
he
hasn
t
the
brains
to
take
a
good
position
when
his
schooling
went
on
year
after
year
i
thought
at
last
to
make
of
him
something
better
than
his
father
a
doctor
or
a
lawyer
but
he
hadn
t
the
brains
he
disappointed
me
bitterly
and
what
use
can
he
make
of
my
money
when
i
m
in
my
grave
if
i
die
soon
he
ll
marry
and
ruin
his
life
and
won
t
it
be
the
same
with
nancy
some
plotting
greedy
fellow
the
kind
of
man
you
see
everywhere
will
fool
her
for
the
money
s
we
must
hope
they
ll
be
much
older
and
wiser
before
they
have
to
act
for
themselves
said
mary
looking
into
her
master
s
troubled
face
yes
he
came
nearer
to
her
with
a
sudden
hopefulness
and
whether
i
live
much
longer
or
not
i
can
do
something
to
guard
them
against
their
folly
they
needn
t
have
the
money
as
soon
as
i
am
he
seated
himself
in
front
of
his
companion
i
want
to
ask
you
something
mary
if
they
were
left
alone
would
you
be
willing
to
live
here
still
as
you
do
now
for
a
few
more
years
i
shall
do
whatever
you
wish
whatever
you
bid
me
lord
answered
the
woman
in
a
voice
of
heartfelt
loyalty
you
would
stay
on
and
keep
house
for
them
but
would
they
go
on
living
here
i
could
make
them
do
so
i
could
put
it
down
as
a
condition
in
my
will
at
all
events
i
would
make
nancy
stay
horace
might
live
where
he
liked
though
not
with
money
to
throw
about
they
have
no
relatives
that
could
be
of
any
use
to
them
i
should
wish
nancy
to
go
on
living
here
and
you
with
her
and
she
would
only
have
just
a
sufficient
income
paid
by
my
old
friend
barmby
or
by
his
son
and
that
till
she
was
what
i
have
thought
of
by
that
time
she
would
either
have
learnt
wisdom
or
she
never
would
she
must
be
free
sooner
or
but
she
couldn
t
live
by
herself
you
tell
me
you
would
stay
he
exclaimed
impulsively
oh
but
i
am
only
her
servant
that
wouldn
t
be
it
would
be
your
position
shall
be
changed
there
s
no
one
living
to
whom
i
could
trust
her
as
i
could
to
you
there
s
no
woman
i
respect
so
much
for
twenty
years
you
have
proved
yourself
worthy
of
respect
and
it
shall
be
paid
to
his
vehemence
would
brook
no
opposition
you
said
you
would
do
as
i
wished
i
wish
you
to
have
a
new
position
in
this
house
you
shall
no
longer
be
called
a
servant
you
shall
be
our
housekeeper
and
our
friend
i
will
have
it
i
tell
you
he
cried
angrily
you
shall
sit
at
table
with
us
and
live
with
us
nancy
still
has
sense
enough
to
acknowledge
that
this
is
only
your
just
reward
from
her
i
know
there
won
t
be
a
word
of
objection
what
can
you
have
to
say
against
it
the
woman
was
pale
with
emotion
her
reserve
and
sensibility
shrank
from
what
seemed
to
her
an
invidious
honour
yet
she
durst
not
irritate
the
sick
man
by
opposition
it
will
make
nancy
think
he
pursued
with
emphasis
it
will
help
her
perhaps
to
see
the
difference
between
worthless
women
who
put
themselves
forward
and
the
women
of
real
value
who
make
no
pretences
perhaps
it
isn
t
too
late
to
set
good
examples
before
her
i
ve
never
found
her
though
she
s
wilful
it
isn
t
her
heart
that
s
wrong
i
hope
and
think
not
only
her
mind
that
s
got
stuffed
with
foolish
ideas
since
her
grandmother
s
death
she
s
had
no
guidance
you
shall
talk
to
her
as
a
woman
can
not
all
at
once
but
when
she
s
used
to
thinking
of
you
in
this
new
you
are
forgetting
her
friends
mary
said
at
length
with
eyes
of
earnest
appeal
her
friends
she
s
better
without
such
friends
there
s
one
thing
i
used
to
hope
but
i
ve
given
it
up
i
thought
once
that
she
might
have
come
to
a
liking
for
samuel
barmby
but
now
i
don
t
think
she
ever
will
and
i
believe
it
s
her
friends
that
are
to
blame
for
it
one
thing
i
know
that
she
ll
never
meet
with
any
one
who
will
make
her
so
good
a
husband
as
he
would
we
don
t
think
alike
in
every
way
he
s
a
young
man
and
has
the
new
ideas
but
i
ve
known
him
since
he
was
a
boy
and
i
respect
his
character
he
has
a
conscience
which
is
no
common
thing
he
lives
a
clean
homely
life
and
you
won
t
find
many
of
his
age
who
do
nancy
thinks
herself
a
thousand
times
too
good
for
him
i
only
hope
he
mayn
t
prove
a
great
deal
too
good
for
but
i
ve
given
up
that
thought
i
ve
never
spoken
to
her
about
it
and
i
never
shall
no
good
comes
of
forcing
a
girl
s
inclination
i
only
tell
you
of
it
mary
because
i
want
you
to
understand
what
has
been
going
they
heard
a
bell
ring
that
of
the
front
door
it
ll
be
miss
nancy
said
mary
rising
go
to
the
door
then
if
it
s
nancy
tell
her
i
want
to
speak
to
her
and
come
back
mr
lord
do
as
i
tell
you
at
once
all
the
latent
force
of
stephen
s
character
now
declared
itself
he
stood
upright
his
face
stern
and
dignified
in
a
few
moments
nancy
entered
the
room
and
mary
followed
her
at
a
distance
nancy
said
the
father
i
want
to
tell
you
of
a
change
in
the
house
you
know
that
mary
has
been
with
us
for
twenty
years
you
know
that
for
a
long
time
we
haven
t
thought
of
her
as
a
servant
but
as
a
friend
and
one
of
the
best
possible
it
s
time
now
to
show
our
gratitude
mary
will
continue
to
help
us
as
before
but
henceforth
she
is
one
of
our
family
she
will
eat
with
us
and
sit
with
us
and
i
look
to
you
my
girl
to
make
the
change
an
easy
and
pleasant
one
for
as
soon
as
she
understood
the
drift
of
her
father
s
speech
nancy
experienced
a
shock
and
could
not
conceal
it
but
when
silence
came
she
had
commanded
herself
an
instant
s
pause
then
with
her
brightest
smile
she
turned
to
mary
and
spoke
in
a
voice
of
kindness
father
is
quite
right
your
place
is
with
us
i
am
glad
very
mary
looked
from
lord
to
his
daughter
tried
vainly
to
speak
and
left
the
room
chapter
his
father
s
contemptuous
wrath
had
an
ill
effect
upon
horace
of
an
amiable
disposition
and
without
independence
of
character
he
might
have
been
guided
by
a
judicious
parent
through
all
the
perils
of
his
for
fanny
french
thrown
upon
his
own
feeble
resources
he
regarded
himself
as
a
victim
of
the
traditional
struggle
between
prosaic
age
and
nobly
passionate
youth
and
resolved
at
all
hazards
to
follow
the
heroic
course
which
meant
first
of
all
a
cold
taciturnity
towards
his
father
and
as
to
his
future
conduct
a
total
disregard
of
the
domestic
restraints
which
he
had
hitherto
accepted
in
a
day
or
two
he
sat
down
and
wrote
his
father
a
long
letter
of
small
merit
as
a
composition
and
otherwise
illustrating
the
profitless
nature
of
the
education
for
which
stephen
lord
had
hopefully
paid
it
began
with
a
declaration
of
rights
he
was
a
man
he
could
no
longer
submit
to
childish
trammels
a
man
must
not
be
put
to
inconvenience
by
the
necessity
of
coming
home
at
early
hours
a
man
could
not
brook
on
the
subject
of
his
intimacies
his
expenditure
and
so
forth
above
all
a
man
was
answerable
to
no
one
but
himself
for
his
relations
with
the
other
sex
for
the
sacred
hopes
he
cherished
for
his
emotions
and
aspirations
which
transcended
even
a
man
s
with
much
more
of
like
tenor
to
this
epistle
delivered
by
post
lord
made
no
answer
horace
flattered
himself
that
he
had
gained
a
victory
there
was
nothing
like
firmness
and
that
evening
about
nine
he
went
to
de
crespigny
park
as
usual
he
had
to
ring
the
bell
two
or
three
times
before
any
one
came
the
lively
notes
of
a
piano
sounded
from
the
intimating
no
doubt
that
peachey
had
guests
the
door
at
length
opened
and
he
bade
the
servant
let
miss
fanny
know
that
he
was
here
he
would
wait
in
the
it
was
not
yet
dark
but
objects
could
only
just
be
distinguished
the
gloom
supplied
horace
with
a
suggestion
at
which
he
laughed
to
himself
he
had
laid
down
his
hat
and
cane
when
a
voice
surprised
him
who
s
that
asked
some
one
from
the
back
of
the
room
oh
are
there
mr
peachey
i
ve
come
to
see
fanny
i
didn
t
care
to
go
among
the
all
right
we
d
better
light
the
with
annoyance
horace
saw
the
master
of
the
house
come
forward
and
strike
a
match
remains
of
dinner
were
still
on
the
table
the
two
exchanged
glances
how
is
your
father
peachey
inquired
he
had
a
dull
depressed
look
and
moved
languidly
to
draw
down
the
blind
oh
he
isn
t
quite
up
to
the
mark
but
it
s
nothing
serious
i
miss
lord
quite
well
we
haven
t
seen
much
of
her
i
don
t
know
why
i
m
nobody
can
depend
upon
her
very
well
i
ll
leave
you
said
the
other
with
a
dreary
look
about
the
room
the
table
ought
to
have
been
cleared
by
now
but
that
s
nothing
confounded
servants
muttered
horace
oh
yes
the
servants
was
peachey
s
ironical
reply
as
soon
as
he
was
left
alone
horace
turned
out
the
gas
then
he
stood
near
the
door
trembling
with
amorous
anticipation
but
minutes
went
by
his
impatience
grew
intolerable
he
stamped
and
twisted
his
fingers
together
then
of
a
sudden
the
door
opened
why
it
s
dark
there
s
nobody
fanny
discovered
her
mistake
she
was
seized
and
lifted
off
her
feet
oh
do
you
want
to
eat
me
i
ll
hit
you
as
hard
as
i
can
i
will
you
re
spoiling
my
dress
the
last
remonstrance
was
in
a
note
that
horace
did
not
venture
to
disregard
strike
a
light
silly
i
know
you
ve
done
something
to
my
horace
pleaded
abjectly
to
be
forgiven
and
that
the
room
might
remain
shadowed
but
fanny
was
disturbed
in
temper
if
you
don
t
light
the
gas
i
ll
go
at
i
haven
t
any
matches
oh
just
like
you
you
never
have
anything
i
thought
every
man
carried
she
broke
from
him
and
ran
out
wretched
in
the
fear
that
she
might
not
return
horace
waited
on
the
threshold
in
the
some
one
was
singing
the
maid
of
the
it
came
to
an
end
and
there
sounded
voices
which
the
tormented
listener
strove
to
recognise
for
at
least
ten
minutes
he
waited
and
was
all
but
frantic
when
the
girl
made
her
appearance
coming
downstairs
never
do
that
again
she
said
viciously
i
ve
had
to
unfasten
my
things
and
put
them
straight
what
a
nuisance
you
are
he
stood
cowed
before
her
limp
and
tremulous
there
light
the
gas
why
couldn
t
you
come
into
the
like
other
people
do
who
is
there
asked
the
young
man
when
he
had
obeyed
her
go
and
see
for
don
t
be
angry
he
followed
her
like
a
dog
as
she
walked
round
the
table
to
look
at
herself
in
the
mirror
over
the
fireplace
it
was
only
because
i
m
so
fond
of
oh
what
a
silly
you
are
she
laughed
seating
herself
on
the
arm
of
an
go
ahead
what
s
the
latest
well
for
one
thing
i
ve
had
a
very
clear
understanding
with
the
gov
nor
about
my
independence
i
showed
him
that
i
meant
having
my
own
way
and
he
might
bully
as
much
as
he
it
was
not
thus
that
horace
would
naturally
have
spoken
not
thus
that
he
thought
of
his
father
fanny
had
subdued
him
to
her
own
level
poisoned
him
with
the
desires
excited
by
her
presence
and
he
knew
his
baseness
he
was
not
ignorant
of
the
girl
s
ignoble
nature
only
the
fury
of
a
virgin
passion
enabled
him
to
talk
and
sometimes
think
as
though
he
were
in
love
with
ideal
purity
i
didn
t
think
you
had
the
pluck
said
fanny
swinging
one
of
her
feet
as
she
tittered
that
shows
you
haven
t
done
me
and
you
re
going
to
stay
out
late
at
night
as
late
as
i
like
horace
answered
crossing
his
arms
then
where
will
you
take
me
it
happened
that
horace
was
in
funds
just
now
he
had
received
his
quarter
s
salary
board
and
lodging
were
no
expense
to
him
he
provided
his
own
clothing
but
with
this
exception
had
to
meet
no
serious
claim
so
in
reply
to
fanny
s
characteristic
question
he
jingled
coins
wherever
you
dorothy
ruddigore
delighted
with
his
assent
she
became
more
gracious
permitted
a
modest
caress
and
presently
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
on
to
her
lover
s
knee
she
was
passive
unconcerned
no
second
year
graduate
of
the
pavement
could
have
preserved
a
completer
equanimity
it
did
not
appear
that
her
pulse
quickened
ever
so
slightly
nor
had
her
eyelid
the
suspicion
of
a
droop
she
hummed
queen
of
my
heart
and
grew
absent
in
speculative
thought
whilst
horace
burned
and
panted
at
the
proximity
of
her
white
flesh
oh
how
i
do
love
you
fanny
she
trod
playfully
on
his
toe
you
haven
t
told
the
old
gentleman
yet
i
i
m
thinking
about
it
but
fanny
suppose
he
was
to
to
refuse
to
do
anything
for
us
would
it
make
any
difference
there
are
lots
of
people
who
marry
on
a
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
oh
lots
the
maiden
arched
her
brows
and
puckered
her
lips
hitherto
it
had
been
taken
for
granted
that
lord
would
be
ready
with
subsidy
horace
in
a
large
vague
way
had
hinted
that
assurance
long
ago
fanny
s
disinclination
to
plight
her
troth
she
still
deemed
herself
absolutely
free
had
alone
interfered
between
the
young
man
and
a
definite
project
of
marriage
what
kind
of
people
she
asked
coldly
oh
respectable
educated
people
like
and
live
in
apartments
thank
you
i
don
t
quite
see
myself
there
isn
t
a
bit
of
hurry
dear
boy
wait
a
she
began
to
sing
wait
till
the
clouds
roll
if
you
thought
as
much
of
me
as
i
do
of
you
tired
of
her
position
fanny
jumped
up
and
took
a
spoonful
of
sweet
jelly
from
a
dish
on
the
table
have
some
come
here
again
i
ve
something
more
to
tell
you
something
very
she
could
only
be
prevailed
upon
to
take
a
seat
near
him
horace
beset
with
doubts
as
to
his
prudence
but
unable
to
keep
the
secret
began
to
recount
the
story
of
his
meeting
with
damerel
whom
he
had
now
seen
for
the
second
time
fanny
s
curiosity
instantly
awakened
grew
eager
as
he
proceeded
she
questioned
with
skill
and
pertinacity
and
elicited
many
more
details
than
nancy
lord
had
been
able
to
gather
you
ll
promise
me
not
to
say
a
word
to
any
one
pleaded
horace
i
won
t
open
my
lips
but
you
re
quite
sure
she
s
as
old
as
you
say
old
enough
to
be
my
mother
i
assure
the
girl
s
suspicions
were
not
wholly
set
at
rest
but
she
made
no
further
display
of
them
now
just
think
what
an
advantage
it
might
be
to
you
to
know
her
horace
pursued
she
d
introduce
you
at
once
to
fashionable
society
really
people
how
would
you
like
that
not
bad
was
the
judicial
reply
she
must
have
no
end
of
money
and
who
knows
what
she
might
do
for
me
it
s
a
jolly
queer
thing
mused
the
maiden
there
s
no
denying
that
we
must
keep
it
close
whatever
we
you
haven
t
told
anybody
else
not
a
soul
horace
lied
stoutly
they
were
surprised
by
the
sudden
opening
of
the
door
a
servant
appeared
to
clear
the
table
fanny
reprimanded
her
for
neglecting
to
knock
we
may
as
well
go
into
the
there
s
nobody
particular
only
middlemist
and
crewe
and
in
the
hall
they
encountered
crewe
himself
who
stood
there
conversing
with
beatrice
a
few
words
were
exchanged
by
the
two
men
and
horace
followed
his
enchantress
into
the
where
he
found
seated
in
conversation
with
peachey
two
persons
whom
he
had
occasionally
met
here
one
of
them
middlemist
was
a
stout
coarse
woman
with
fingers
much
bejewelled
until
a
year
or
two
ago
she
had
adorned
the
private
bar
of
a
kept
by
her
husband
retired
from
this
honourable
post
she
now
devoted
herself
to
society
and
the
domestic
virtues
the
other
guest
murch
by
name
proclaimed
herself
at
a
glance
of
less
prosperous
condition
though
no
less
sumptuously
arrayed
her
face
had
a
hungry
spiteful
leering
expression
she
spoke
in
a
shrill
peevish
tone
and
wriggled
nervously
on
her
chair
in
eleven
years
of
married
life
murch
had
borne
six
children
all
of
whom
died
before
they
were
six
months
old
she
lived
apart
from
her
husband
who
had
something
to
do
with
the
manufacture
of
an
infants
food
fanny
was
requested
to
sing
she
sat
down
at
the
piano
rattled
a
prelude
and
gave
forth
an
echo
of
the
s
all
up
with
poor
tommy
now
i
shall
never
more
be
happy
i
vow
it
s
just
a
week
since
my
sairey
went
away
and
it
s
all
up
with
poor
tommy
middlemist
who
prided
herself
upon
serious
vocal
powers
remarked
that
comic
singing
should
be
confined
to
men
you
haven
t
a
bad
voice
my
dear
if
you
would
only
take
pains
with
it
now
sing
us
for
ever
and
for
this
song
being
the
speaker
s
peculiar
glory
she
was
of
course
requested
to
sing
it
herself
and
after
entreaty
consented
her
eyes
turned
upward
her
fat
figure
rolling
from
side
to
side
her
mouth
very
wide
open
middlemist
did
full
justice
to
the
erotic
passion
of
this
great
lyric
if
we
ad
never
met
we
ad
been
spared
this
mad
regret
this
hendless
striving
to
forget
for
hever
hand
for
murch
let
her
head
droop
sentimentally
horace
glanced
at
fanny
who
however
seemed
absorbed
in
reflections
as
unsentimental
as
could
be
in
the
meanwhile
on
a
garden
seat
under
the
calm
but
misty
sky
sat
luckworth
crewe
and
beatrice
french
crewe
smoked
a
cigar
placidly
beatrice
was
laying
before
him
the
suggestion
of
her
great
commercial
scheme
already
confided
to
fanny
how
does
it
strike
you
she
asked
at
length
not
bad
old
chap
there
s
something
in
it
if
you
re
clever
enough
to
carry
it
through
and
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
you
will
you
help
to
set
it
going
can
t
help
with
money
crewe
replied
very
well
will
you
help
in
other
ways
practical
hints
and
so
on
of
course
i
will
always
ready
to
encourage
merit
in
the
line
what
capital
are
you
prepared
to
put
into
it
not
much
the
public
must
supply
the
a
sound
principle
crewe
laughed
but
i
shouldn
t
go
on
the
old
lines
you
didn
t
think
of
starting
a
limited
company
you
d
find
difficulties
now
what
you
want
to
start
is
a
let
us
call
it
the
south
london
dress
supply
association
or
something
of
that
kind
but
you
won
t
get
to
that
all
at
once
you
ought
to
have
premises
to
begin
i
m
aware
of
can
you
raise
a
thousand
or
so
yes
i
could
if
i
now
look
here
your
notion
of
the
fashion
club
is
a
deuced
good
one
and
i
don
t
see
why
it
shouldn
t
be
pretty
easily
started
out
of
every
five
hundred
women
you
can
reckon
on
four
hundred
and
being
fools
and
there
isn
t
a
female
fool
who
wouldn
t
read
and
think
about
a
circular
which
promised
her
fashionable
dresses
for
an
unfashionable
price
that
s
a
great
and
sound
basis
to
start
on
what
i
advise
is
that
you
should
first
of
all
advertise
for
a
concern
that
would
admit
a
partner
with
a
small
capital
you
ll
have
between
ten
and
twelve
hundred
replies
but
don
t
be
staggered
go
through
them
carefully
and
select
a
shop
that
s
well
situated
and
doing
a
respectable
trade
get
hold
of
these
people
and
induce
them
to
make
changes
in
their
business
to
suit
your
idea
then
blaze
away
with
circulars
headed
south
london
fashion
club
send
them
round
the
whole
district
addressed
to
women
every
idiot
of
them
will
at
all
events
come
and
look
at
the
shop
that
can
be
depended
upon
in
itself
no
bad
advertisement
arrange
to
have
a
special
department
special
entrance
if
possible
with
the
club
painted
up
yes
by
jingo
have
a
big
room
with
comfortable
chairs
and
the
women
s
weekly
papers
lying
about
and
smart
dresses
displayed
on
ems
like
they
have
in
windows
make
the
subscription
very
low
at
first
and
give
rattling
good
value
never
mind
if
you
lose
by
it
then
when
you
ve
got
hold
of
a
lot
of
likely
people
try
them
with
the
share
project
if
you
lose
no
time
you
can
bring
in
the
jubilee
somehow
yes
start
with
the
jubilee
fashion
i
wonder
nobody
s
done
it
beatrice
was
growing
elated
the
public
has
to
wait
for
its
benefactors
she
replied
i
ll
tell
you
what
would
you
like
me
to
sketch
you
out
a
prospectus
of
the
club
yes
you
might
do
that
if
you
like
you
won
t
expect
to
be
paid
hang
it
what
do
you
take
me
for
business
is
business
miss
french
remarked
coldly
so
it
is
and
friendship
is
friendship
got
a
match
he
laughed
no
i
suppose
you
haven
i
ll
go
and
get
you
one
if
you
there
s
a
good
fellow
i
ll
think
in
the
beatrice
rose
lazily
and
was
absent
for
several
minutes
when
she
returned
crewe
his
cigar
why
shouldn
t
i
start
the
shop
on
my
own
account
beatrice
asked
you
haven
t
capital
enough
a
little
place
wouldn
t
i
think
i
can
get
fanny
to
join
can
you
what
will
young
lord
have
to
say
to
that
psh
that
s
all
fooling
it
ll
never
come
to
anything
unless
of
course
the
old
man
turned
up
his
toes
and
left
the
boy
a
tidy
sum
but
he
won
t
just
yet
i
ve
told
fanny
that
if
she
ll
raise
something
on
her
houses
i
ll
guarantee
her
the
same
income
she
has
take
my
advice
said
crewe
weightily
and
hook
on
to
an
established
business
of
course
you
can
change
the
name
if
you
like
and
there
d
have
to
be
alterations
and
painting
up
to
give
a
new
it
s
risky
dealing
with
strangers
how
if
they
got
hold
of
my
idea
and
then
refused
to
take
me
in
well
now
look
here
after
all
i
ll
make
a
bargain
with
you
old
chap
if
i
can
introduce
you
to
the
right
people
and
get
you
safely
started
will
you
give
me
all
your
advertising
on
the
usual
commission
you
mean
give
it
to
bullock
and
freeman
no
i
don
t
it
s
a
secret
just
yet
but
i
m
going
to
start
for
beatrice
was
silent
they
exchanged
a
look
in
the
gloom
and
crewe
nodded
in
confirmation
of
his
announcement
how
much
have
you
got
miss
french
inquired
carelessly
not
much
most
of
the
capital
is
he
touched
his
forehead
same
as
with
the
young
woman
glanced
at
him
again
and
said
in
a
lower
voice
you
d
have
had
more
by
now
if
crewe
waited
puffing
his
cigar
but
she
did
not
finish
maybe
he
replied
impartially
maybe
don
t
think
i
m
sorry
beatrice
hastened
to
add
it
was
an
idea
like
any
not
half
a
bad
idea
but
there
were
after
a
pause
beatrice
inquired
do
you
still
think
the
same
about
women
with
money
just
the
same
crewe
replied
at
once
though
with
less
than
his
usual
directness
the
question
seemed
to
make
him
meditative
just
the
same
every
man
looks
at
it
in
his
own
way
of
course
i
m
not
the
sort
of
chap
to
knuckle
under
to
my
wife
and
there
isn
t
one
woman
in
a
thousand
if
she
gave
her
husband
a
start
could
help
reminding
him
of
it
it
s
the
wrong
way
about
let
women
be
as
independent
as
they
like
as
long
as
they
re
not
married
i
never
think
the
worse
of
them
whatever
they
do
that
s
honest
but
a
wife
must
play
second
fiddle
and
think
her
husband
a
small
god
almighty
that
s
my
way
of
looking
at
the
beatrice
laughed
scornfully
all
right
we
shall
when
do
you
start
business
this
side
christmas
end
of
september
you
think
to
snatch
a
good
deal
from
b
i
daresay
crewe
nodded
and
smiled
then
you
ll
look
after
this
affair
for
me
said
beatrice
with
a
return
to
the
tone
of
strict
business
without
loss
of
time
you
shall
be
advised
of
progress
of
course
i
must
debit
you
with
all
right
mind
you
charge
for
all
the
penny
every
one
don
t
you
forget
he
stood
up
tilted
forward
on
his
toes
and
stretched
himself
i
ll
be
trotting
homewards
it
ll
be
time
for
when
i
get
to
chapter
nancy
was
undisturbed
by
the
promotion
of
mary
woodruff
a
short
time
ago
it
would
have
offended
her
she
would
have
thought
her
dignity
her
social
prospects
imperilled
she
was
now
careless
on
that
score
and
felt
it
a
relief
to
cast
off
the
show
of
domestic
authority
henceforth
her
position
would
be
like
that
of
horace
all
she
now
desired
was
perfect
freedom
from
responsibility
to
be
as
it
were
a
mere
lodger
in
the
house
to
come
and
go
unquestioned
and
unrestrained
by
duties
thus
by
aid
of
circumstance
had
she
put
herself
into
complete
accord
with
the
spirit
of
her
time
abundant
privilege
no
obligation
a
reference
of
all
things
to
her
sovereign
will
and
pleasure
withal
a
defiant
rather
than
a
hopeful
mood
resentment
of
the
undisguisable
fact
that
her
will
was
sovereign
only
in
a
poor
little
sphere
which
she
would
gladly
have
transcended
she
never
went
in
the
direction
of
champion
hill
formerly
her
favourite
walk
if
jessica
morgan
spoke
of
her
acquaintances
there
she
turned
abruptly
to
another
subject
she
thought
of
the
place
as
an
abode
of
arrogance
and
snobbery
she
recalled
with
malicious
satisfaction
her
remark
to
lionel
tarrant
let
him
think
of
her
as
he
would
at
all
events
he
could
no
longer
imagine
her
overawed
by
his
social
prestige
the
probability
was
that
she
had
hurt
him
in
a
sensitive
spot
it
might
be
hoped
that
the
wound
would
rankle
for
a
long
time
her
personal
demeanour
showed
a
change
so
careful
hitherto
of
feminine
grace
and
decorum
she
began
to
affect
a
mannishness
of
bearing
a
bluntness
of
speech
such
as
found
favour
at
de
crespigny
park
in
a
few
weeks
she
had
resumed
friendly
intercourse
with
peachey
and
her
sisters
and
spent
an
occasional
evening
at
their
house
her
father
asked
no
questions
she
rarely
saw
him
except
at
meals
a
stranger
must
have
observed
the
signs
of
progressive
malady
in
lord
s
face
but
nancy
was
aware
of
nothing
to
cause
uneasiness
she
thought
of
him
as
suffering
a
little
from
gout
elderly
people
were
of
course
subject
to
such
disorders
on
most
days
he
went
to
business
if
he
remained
at
home
mary
attended
him
assiduously
and
he
would
accept
no
other
ministration
nancy
was
no
longer
inclined
to
study
and
cared
little
for
reading
of
any
sort
that
new
book
on
evolution
which
she
had
brought
from
the
library
just
before
jubilee
day
was
still
lying
about
a
dozen
times
she
had
looked
at
it
with
impatience
and
reminded
herself
that
it
must
be
returned
evolution
she
already
knew
all
about
darwinism
all
she
needed
to
know
if
necessary
she
could
talk
about
it
oh
with
an
air
but
who
wanted
to
talk
about
such
things
after
all
only
priggish
people
the
kind
of
people
who
lived
at
champion
hill
or
idiots
like
samuel
bennett
barmby
who
bothered
about
the
future
of
the
world
what
was
it
to
the
future
of
the
world
she
wanted
to
live
in
the
present
to
enjoy
her
youth
an
evening
like
that
she
had
spent
in
the
huge
crowd
with
a
man
like
crewe
to
amuse
her
with
his
talk
was
worth
whole
oceans
of
culture
she
already
possessed
abundance
of
it
the
heap
of
books
she
had
read
last
winter
she
had
attended
a
course
of
lectures
delivered
by
a
young
university
gentleman
with
a
tone
of
bland
omniscience
on
the
history
of
hellenic
civilisation
her
written
answers
to
the
little
test
papers
had
been
marked
very
was
it
not
a
proof
of
culture
achieved
education
must
not
encroach
upon
the
years
of
maturity
nature
marked
the
time
when
a
woman
should
begin
to
live
there
was
poor
jessica
as
july
drew
on
jessica
began
to
look
cadaverous
ghostly
she
would
assuredly
break
down
long
before
the
time
of
her
examination
what
a
wretched
what
an
absurd
existence
her
home
too
was
so
miserable
morgan
lay
ill
unable
to
attend
to
anything
if
she
could
not
have
a
change
of
air
it
must
soon
be
all
over
with
her
but
they
had
no
money
no
chance
of
going
to
the
seaside
it
happened
at
length
that
lord
saw
jessica
one
evening
when
she
had
come
to
spend
an
hour
in
grove
lane
after
her
departure
he
asked
nancy
what
was
the
matter
with
the
girl
and
nancy
explained
the
situation
well
why
not
take
her
with
you
when
you
go
away
i
didn
t
know
that
i
was
going
away
father
nothing
has
been
said
of
it
s
your
own
business
i
leave
you
to
make
what
plans
you
nancy
reflected
ought
to
have
a
change
she
said
considerately
it
would
do
you
good
suppose
we
all
go
to
teignmouth
i
should
think
that
would
suit
why
teignmouth
i
enjoyed
it
last
year
and
the
lodgings
were
comfortable
we
could
have
the
same
from
the
first
week
in
how
do
you
know
i
wrote
the
other
day
and
asked
nancy
replied
with
a
smile
but
lord
declined
to
leave
home
mary
woodruff
did
her
best
to
persuade
him
until
he
angrily
imposed
silence
in
a
day
or
two
he
said
to
nancy
if
you
wish
to
go
to
teignmouth
take
jessica
and
her
mother
people
mustn
t
die
for
want
of
a
note
make
your
arrangements
and
let
me
know
what
money
you
ll
it
s
very
kind
of
you
lord
turned
away
his
daughter
noticed
that
he
walked
feebly
and
she
felt
a
moment
s
compunction
father
you
are
not
so
well
without
looking
round
he
replied
that
he
would
be
well
enough
if
left
alone
and
nancy
did
not
venture
to
say
more
a
few
days
later
she
called
in
de
crespigny
park
after
dinnertime
peachey
and
fanny
were
at
brighton
beatrice
had
preferred
to
stay
in
london
being
very
busy
with
her
great
project
whilst
she
talked
of
it
with
nancy
peachey
and
luckworth
crewe
came
in
together
there
was
sprightly
conversation
in
which
the
host
obviously
glad
of
his
wife
s
absence
took
a
moderate
part
presently
miss
lord
and
he
found
themselves
gossiping
alone
the
other
two
had
moved
aside
and
as
a
look
informed
nancy
were
deep
in
confidential
dialogue
what
do
you
think
of
that
business
she
asked
her
companion
in
an
undertone
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
it
answers
said
the
young
man
speaking
as
usual
with
a
soft
amiable
voice
our
friend
is
helping
and
he
generally
knows
what
he
s
crewe
remained
only
for
on
shaking
hands
with
him
nancy
made
known
that
she
was
going
to
the
seaside
next
monday
for
a
few
weeks
and
the
man
of
business
answered
only
with
i
hope
you
ll
enjoy
soon
afterwards
she
took
leave
at
the
junction
of
de
crespigny
park
and
grove
lane
some
one
approached
her
and
with
no
great
surprise
nancy
saw
that
it
was
crewe
been
waiting
for
you
he
said
you
remember
you
promised
me
another
oh
it
s
much
too
of
course
it
is
i
didn
t
mean
now
but
she
moved
on
in
the
direction
away
from
her
home
i
shall
be
with
friends
in
the
evening
the
confound
it
i
had
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
you
for
last
saturday
but
some
country
people
nabbed
me
for
the
whole
of
that
day
i
took
them
up
the
monument
and
up
st
paul
i
ve
never
been
up
the
monument
said
nancy
never
come
afternoon
then
you
can
spare
the
afternoon
let
s
meet
early
somewhere
take
a
bus
to
london
bridge
i
ll
be
at
the
north
end
of
london
bridge
at
three
o
all
right
i
ll
be
there
nancy
replied
you
really
will
three
sharp
i
was
never
late
at
an
appointment
business
or
which
do
you
consider
this
asked
his
companion
with
a
shrewd
glance
now
that
s
unkind
i
came
here
on
business
though
you
quite
understand
that
didn
t
you
i
shouldn
t
like
you
to
make
any
mistake
business
pure
and
why
of
course
replied
nancy
with
an
ingenuous
air
what
else
could
it
be
and
she
added
don
t
come
any
further
crewe
went
off
into
the
darkness
the
next
afternoon
nancy
alighted
at
london
bridge
a
full
quarter
of
an
hour
late
it
had
been
raining
at
intervals
through
the
day
and
clouds
still
cast
a
gloom
over
the
wet
streets
crewe
quite
insensible
to
atmospheric
influence
came
forward
with
his
wonted
brisk
step
and
animated
visage
at
miss
lord
s
side
he
looked
rather
more
plebeian
than
when
walking
by
himself
his
not
of
the
newest
utterly
misbecame
his
head
and
was
always
at
an
unconventional
angle
generally
tilting
back
his
clothes
of
no
fashionable
cut
bore
the
traces
of
perpetual
hurry
and
multifarious
impact
but
he
carried
a
perfectly
new
and
expensive
umbrella
to
which
as
soon
as
he
had
shaken
hands
with
her
he
drew
nancy
s
attention
a
present
this
morning
from
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
business
i
ran
into
his
shop
to
get
shelter
upon
my
word
i
had
no
intention
didn
t
think
anything
about
it
however
he
owed
me
an
acknowledgment
i
ve
sent
him
three
customers
from
our
office
since
i
saw
him
last
i
shall
have
half
a
day
at
the
seaside
on
monday
there

a
sale
of
down
at
whitsand
the
estate
agents

a
complimentary
special
train
for
people
going
down
to
bid
and
give
a
lunch
before
the
auction
begins
not
bad

going
to
bid
asked
nancy
i
m
going
to
have
a
look
at
all
events
and
if
i
see
anything
that
takes
my
fancy
ever
been
to
whitsand
i
m
told
it
s
a
growing
place
i
should
like
to
get
hold
of
a
few
advertising
where
is
it
you
are
going
to
on
monday
teignmouth
i
don
t
know

part
of
the
country

but
i
shan
t
have
time
i
ve
got
my
work
cut
out
for
august
and
september

you
like
to
come
and
see
the
place
where
i
think
of
opening
shop
is
it
far
no
we
ll
walk
round
when
we
ve
been
up
the
monument
you
don
t
often
go
about
the
city
i
daresay
nothing
doing
of
course
on
a
saturday
nancy
made
him
moderate
his
pace
which
was
too
quick
for
her
part
of
the
pleasure
she
found
in
crewe
s
society
came
from
her
sense
of
being
so
undeniably
his
superior
she
liked
to
give
him
a
sharp
command
and
observe
his
ready
obedience
to
his
talk
she
listened
with
a
condescending
smile
occasionally
making
a
remark
which
implied
a
more
liberal
view
a
larger
intelligence
than
his
thus
as
they
stood
for
a
moment
to
look
down
at
the
steamboat
wharf
and
crewe
made
some
remark
about
the
value
of
a
cargo
just
being
discharged
she
said
carelessly
i
suppose
that
s
the
view
you
take
of
everything
you
rate
everything
at
market
marketable
things
of
course
but
you
know
me
well
enough
to
understand
that
i
m
not
always
thinking
of
the
shop
wait
till
i
ve
made
now
then
clumsy
a
man
leaning
over
the
parapet
by
nancy
s
side
had
pushed
against
her
thus
addressed
he
glared
at
the
speaker
but
encountered
a
bellicose
look
which
kept
him
quiet
i
shall
live
in
a
big
way
crewe
continued
as
they
walked
on
towards
fish
street
hill
not
for
the
swagger
of
it
i
don
t
care
about
that
but
because
i
ve
a
taste
for
luxury
i
shall
have
a
country
house
and
keep
good
horses
and
i
should
like
to
have
a
little
farm
of
my
own
a
model
farm
make
my
own
butter
and
cheese
and
know
that
i
ate
the
real
thing
i
shall
buy
pictures
haven
t
i
told
you
i
like
pictures
oh
yes
i
shall
go
round
among
the
artists
and
encourage
talent
that
hasn
t
made
itself
can
you
recognise
it
asked
nancy
well
i
shall
learn
to
and
i
shall
have
my
wife
s
portrait
painted
by
some
chap
never
mind
what
it
costs
and
hung
in
the
academy
that
s
a
great
idea
of
mine
to
see
my
wife
s
portrait
in
the
his
companion
laughed
take
care
then
that
your
wife
is
i
ll
take
precious
good
care
of
that
crewe
exclaimed
merrily
do
you
suppose
i
should
dream
of
marrying
a
woman
who
wasn
t
don
t
shout
please
people
can
hear
i
beg
your
his
voice
sank
to
humility
that
s
a
bad
habit
of
mine
but
i
was
going
to
say
i
went
to
the
academy
this
year
just
to
look
at
the
portraits
of
men
s
wives
there
was
nothing
particular
in
that
line
not
a
woman
i
should
have
felt
particularly
proud
of
tastes
differ
of
course
mine
has
altered
a
good
deal
in
the
last
ten
years
a
man
can
t
trust
himself
about
women
till
he
s
thirty
or
near
talk
of
something
else
nancy
commanded
certainly
there
s
the
sun
coming
out
you
see
i
was
afraid
it
would
keep
on
raining
and
you
would
have
an
excuse
for
staying
at
i
needed
no
excuse
said
nancy
if
i
hadn
t
wished
to
come
you
may
be
sure
i
should
have
said
crewe
flashed
a
look
at
her
ah
that
s
how
i
like
to
hear
you
speak
that
does
one
good
well
here
we
are
people
used
to
be
fond
of
going
up
they
say
just
to
pitch
themselves
down
a
good
deal
of
needless
trouble
it
seems
to
me
perhaps
they
gave
themselves
the
of
changing
their
minds
before
they
got
to
the
or
wanted
to
see
if
life
looked
any
better
from
up
there
suggested
nancy
or
hoped
somebody
would
catch
them
by
the
and
settle
a
pension
on
them
out
of
thus
jesting
they
began
the
ascent
crewe
whose
spirits
were
at
high
pressure
talked
all
the
way
up
the
winding
stairs
on
issuing
into
daylight
he
became
silent
and
they
stood
side
by
side
mute
before
the
vision
of
london
s
immensity
nancy
began
to
move
round
the
platform
the
strong
west
wind
lashed
her
cheeks
to
a
glowing
colour
excitement
added
brilliancy
to
her
eyes
as
soon
as
she
had
recovered
from
the
first
impression
this
spectacle
of
a
world
s
wonder
served
only
to
exhilarate
her
she
was
not
awed
by
what
she
looked
upon
in
her
conceit
of
she
stood
there
above
the
battling
millions
of
men
proof
against
mystery
and
dread
untouched
by
the
voices
of
the
past
and
in
the
present
seeing
only
common
things
though
from
an
odd
point
of
view
here
her
senses
seemed
to
make
literal
the
assumption
by
which
her
mind
had
always
been
directed
that
she
nancy
lord
was
the
mid
point
of
the
universe
no
humility
awoke
in
her
she
felt
the
stirring
of
envies
avidities
unavowable
passions
and
let
them
flourish
unrebuked
crewe
had
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
his
lips
parted
hungrily
now
how
i
should
like
to
see
you
painted
he
said
all
at
once
just
like
that
i
never
saw
you
looking
so
well
i
believe
you
re
the
most
beautiful
girl
to
be
found
anywhere
in
this
london
there
was
genuine
emotion
in
his
voice
and
his
sweeping
gesture
suited
the
mood
of
vehemence
nancy
having
seen
that
the
two
or
three
other
people
on
the
platform
were
not
within
hearing
gave
an
answer
of
which
the
frankness
surprised
even
herself
portraits
for
the
academy
cost
a
great
deal
you
i
know
but
that
s
what
i
m
working
for
there
are
not
many
men
down
yonder
he
pointed
over
the
city
have
a
better
head
for
than
i
well
prove
it
replied
nancy
and
laughed
as
the
wind
caught
her
breath
how
long
will
you
give
me
she
made
no
answer
but
walked
to
the
side
whence
she
could
look
westward
crewe
followed
close
his
features
still
set
in
the
hungry
look
his
eyes
never
moving
from
her
warm
cheek
and
full
lips
what
it
must
be
she
said
to
have
about
twenty
thousand
a
year
the
man
of
business
gave
a
gasp
in
the
same
moment
he
had
to
clutch
at
his
hat
lest
it
should
be
blown
away
twenty
thousand
a
year
he
echoed
well
it
isn
t
impossible
men
get
beyond
that
and
a
good
deal
beyond
it
but
it
s
a
large
of
course
it
is
but
what
was
it
you
said
the
most
beautiful
girl
in
all
london
that
s
a
large
order
too
isn
t
it
how
much
is
she
worth
you
re
talking
for
the
joke
now
said
crewe
i
don
t
like
to
hear
that
kind
of
thing
either
you
never
think
in
that
my
thoughts
are
my
own
i
may
think
as
i
yes
but
you
have
thoughts
above
have
i
how
kind
of
you
to
say
i
ve
had
enough
of
this
wind
we
ll
go
she
led
the
way
and
neither
of
them
spoke
till
they
were
in
the
street
again
nancy
felt
her
hair
am
i
blown
to
pieces
she
asked
no
no
you
re
all
right
now
will
you
walk
through
the
city
where
s
the
place
you
spoke
of
farringdon
street
that
ll
bring
you
round
to
blackfriars
bridge
when
you
want
to
go
home
but
there
s
plenty
of
time
so
they
rambled
aimlessly
by
the
great
thoroughfares
and
by
hidden
streets
of
which
nancy
had
never
heard
talking
or
silent
as
the
mood
dictated
crewe
had
stories
to
tell
of
this
and
that
thriving
firm
of
others
struggling
in
obscurity
or
falling
from
high
estate
to
him
the
streets
of
london
were
so
many
chapters
of
romance
but
a
romance
always
of
for
he
neither
knew
nor
cared
about
historic
associations
vast
sums
sounded
perpetually
on
his
lips
he
glowed
with
envious
delight
in
telling
of
speculations
that
had
built
up
great
fortunes
he
knew
the
fabulous
rents
that
were
paid
for
sites
that
looked
insignificant
he
repeated
anecdotes
of
calls
made
from
somerset
house
upon
men
of
business
who
had
been
too
modest
in
returning
the
statement
of
their
income
he
revived
legends
of
dire
financial
disaster
and
of
catastrophe
barely
averted
by
strange
expedients
to
all
this
nancy
listened
with
only
moderate
interest
as
often
as
not
she
failed
to
understand
the
details
which
should
have
excited
her
wonder
none
the
less
she
received
an
impression
of
knowledge
acuteness
power
in
the
speaker
and
this
was
decidedly
pleasant
here
s
the
place
where
i
think
of
starting
for
myself
said
crewe
as
he
paused
at
length
before
a
huge
building
in
farringdon
street
this
can
you
afford
such
a
rent
her
companion
burst
into
laughter
i
don
t
mean
the
whole
building
two
or
three
rooms
that
s
all
somewhere
nancy
made
a
jest
of
her
mistake
an
advertising
agent
doesn
t
want
much
space
said
crewe
i
know
a
chap
who
s
doing
a
pretty
big
business
in
one
room
not
far
from
well
we
ve
had
a
long
walk
now
you
must
rest
a
bit
and
have
a
cup
of
i
thought
you
were
going
to
propose
oh
if
you
like
they
went
to
a
restaurant
in
fleet
street
and
sat
for
half
an
hour
over
the
milder
beverage
crewe
talked
of
his
projects
his
prospects
and
nancy
whom
the
afternoon
had
in
truth
fatigued
a
little
though
her
mind
was
still
excited
listened
without
remark
well
he
said
at
length
leaning
towards
her
how
long
do
you
give
me
she
looked
away
and
kept
silence
two
years
just
to
make
a
solid
start
to
show
that
something
worth
talking
about
is
to
come
i
ll
think
about
he
kept
his
position
and
gazed
at
her
i
know
it
isn
t
money
that
would
tempt
he
spoke
in
a
very
low
voice
though
no
one
was
within
earshot
don
t
think
i
make
any
mistake
about
but
i
have
to
show
you
that
there
s
something
in
me
i
wouldn
t
marry
any
woman
that
thought
i
made
love
to
her
out
of
nancy
began
to
draw
on
her
gloves
and
smiled
just
biting
her
lower
lip
will
you
give
me
a
couple
of
years
from
i
won
t
bother
you
it
s
honour
bright
i
ll
think
about
it
nancy
repeated
whilst
you
re
away
yes
whilst
i
m
away
at
and
tell
me
when
you
come
back
tell
you
how
long
and
she
rose
chapter
from
the
mouth
of
exe
to
the
mouth
of
teign
the
coast
is
uninteresting
such
beauty
as
it
once
possessed
has
been
destroyed
by
the
railway
cliffs
of
red
sandstone
drop
to
the
narrow
beach
warm
between
the
blue
of
sky
and
sea
but
without
grandeur
and
robbed
of
their
native
grace
by
which
for
the
most
part
makes
of
them
a
mere
embankment
their
verdure
stripped
away
their
juttings
tunnelled
along
their
base
the
steel
parallels
of
smoky
traffic
dawlish
and

in
themselves

charm

and
shamed
by
the
soft
pure
light
that
falls
about
them
look
blankly
seaward
hiding
what
remains
of
farm
or
cottage
in
the
older
parts
uncovers
no
fair
stretch
of
sand
and
at
flood
the
breakers
are
thwarted
on
a
bulwark
of
piled
stone
which
supports
the
railway
or
protects
a
promenade
but
inland
these
discontents
are
soon
forgotten
there
amid
tilth
and
pasture
gentle
hills
and
leafy
hollows
of
rural
devon
the
eye
rests
and
the
mind
is
soothed
by
lanes
innumerable
deep
between
banks
of
fern
and
flower
by
paths
along
the
of
scented
meadows
by
the
secret
windings
of
copse
and
brake
and
valley
a
way
lies
upward
to
the
long
ridge
of
haldon
where
breezes
sing
among
the
pines
or
sweep
rustling
through
gorse
and
bracken
mile
after
mile
of
rustic
loveliness
ever
and
anon
the
blue
beyond
grassy
slopes
white
farms
dozing
beneath
their
thatch
in
harvest
sunshine
hamlets
forsaken
save
by
women
and
children
by
dogs
and
cats
and
poultry
the
labourers
afield
here
grow
the
tall
foxgloves
bending
a
purple
head
in
the
heat
of
noon
here
the
great
bells
of
the
convolvulus
hang
thick
from
lofty
hedges
massing
their
pink
and
white
against
dark
green
leafage
here
amid
shadowed
undergrowth
trail
the
long
fronds
of
lustrous
hartstongue
wherever
the
eye
falls
profusion
of
summer
s
glory
here
in
many
a
nook
carpeted
with
softest
turf
canopied
with
tangle
of
leaf
and
bloom
solitude
is
safe
from
all
intrusion
unless
it
be
that
of
flitting
bird
or
of
some
timid
wild
thing
that
rustles
for
a
moment
and
is
gone
from
dawn
to
midnight
as
from
midnight
to
dawn
one
who
would
be
alone
with
nature
might
count
upon
the
security
of
these
bosks
and
dells
by
nancy
lord
and
her
companions
such
pleasures
were
unregarded
for
the
first
few
days
after
their
arrival
at
teignmouth
they
sat
or
walked
on
the
promenade
walked
or
sat
on
the
pier
sat
or
walked
on
the
den
a
long
wide
lawn
decked
about
with
shrubs
and
between
houses
and
the
beach
nancy
had
no
wish
to
exert
herself
for
the
weather
was
hot
after
her
morning
bathe
with
jessica
she
found
amusement
enough
in
watching
the
people
most
of
whom
were
here
simply
to
look
at
each
other
or
in
listening
to
the
band
which
played
selections
from
sullivan
varied
with
dance
music
or
in
reading
a
novel
from
the
s
that
is
to
say
gazing
idly
at
the
page
and
letting
such
significance
as
it
possessed
float
upon
her
thoughts
she
was
pleasantly
conscious
that
the
loungers
who
passed
by
male
and
female
gave
something
of
attention
to
her
face
and
costume
without
attempting
to
rival
the
masterpieces
of
fashion
which
invited
envy
or
wonder
from
all
observers
she
thought
herself
nicely
dressed
and
had
in
fact
as
always
made
good
use
of
her
father
s
liberality
her
taste
in
garments
had
a
certain
timidity
that
served
her
well
by
avoiding
the
extremes
of
mode
and
in
virtue
of
her
admirable
figure
she
took
the
eye
of
those
who
looked
for
refinement
rather
than
for
extravagance
the
unconsidered
grace
of
her
bearing
might
be
recognised
by
all
whom
such
things
concerned
it
by
no
means
suggested
that
she
came
from
a
small
house
in
camberwell
in
her
companions
to
be
sure
she
was
unfortunate
but
the
attire
and
unimpressive
persons
of
morgan
and
jessica
at
least
did
her
the
office
of
relief
by
contrast
nancy
had
made
this
reflection
she
was
not
above
it
yet
her
actual
goodness
of
heart
saved
her
from
ever
feeling
ashamed
of
the
morgans
it
gratified
her
to
think
that
she
was
doing
them
a
substantial
kindness
but
for
her
they
would
have
dragged
through
a
wretched
summer
in
their
unwholesome
jimcrack
house
without
a
breath
of
pure
air
without
a
sight
of
the
free
heaven
and
to
both
of
them
that
would
probably
have
meant
a
grave
illness
morgan
was
a
thin
tremulous
woman
with
watery
eyes
and
a
singular
redness
about
the
prominent
part
of
her
face
which
seemed
to
indicate
a
determination
of
blood
to
the
nose
all
her
married
life
had
been
spent
in
a
cheerless
struggle
to
maintain
the
externals
of
gentility
not
that
she
was
vain
or
frivolous
indeed
her
natural
tendencies
made
for
homeliness
in
everything
but
by
birth
and
by
marriage
connected
with
genteel
people
she
felt
it
impossible
to
abandon
that
mode
of
living
which
is
supposed
to
distinguish
the
educated
class
from
all
beneath
it
she
had
brought
into
the
world
three
sons
and
three
daughters
of
the
former
two
were
dead
and
of
the
latter
one
in
each
case
poverty
of
diet
having
proved
fatal
to
a
weak
constitution
for
close
upon
thirty
years
the
family
had
lived
in
houses
of
which
the
rent
was
out
of
all
reasonable
proportion
to
their
means
at
present
with
a
total
income
of
one
hundred
and
sixty
pounds
morgan
called
himself
a
commission
agent
and
seldom
had
anything
to
do
they
paid
in
rent
and
rates
a
matter
of
and
bemoaned
the
fate
which
neighboured
them
with
people
only
by
courtesy
to
be
called
gentlefolk
of
course
they
kept
a
servant
her
wages
nine
pounds
a
year
whilst
the
mother
and
elder
daughter
were
at
teignmouth
mr
morgan
his
son
and
the
younger
girl
felt
themselves
justified
in
making
up
for
lack
of
holiday
by
an
extra
supply
of
butcher
s
meat
but
with
as
little
discretion
in
this
as
in
other
things
morgan
allowed
scarce
an
hour
of
the
day
to
pass
without
uttering
her
gratitude
to
nancy
lord
for
the
benefit
she
was
enjoying
to
escape
these
oppressive
thanks
nancy
did
her
best
never
to
be
alone
with
the
poor
lady
but
a
was
occasionally
unavoidable
as
for
instance
on
the
third
or
fourth
day
after
their
arrival
when
morgan
had
begged
nancy
s
company
for
a
walk
on
the
den
whilst
jessica
wrote
letters
at
the
end
of
a
tedious
hour
jessica
joined
them
and
her
face
had
an
unwonted
expression
she
beckoned
her
friend
apart
you
ll
be
surprised
who
do
you
think
is
here
no
one
that
will
bore
us
i
mr
tarrant
i
met
him
near
the
and
he
stopped
nancy
frowned
are
they
all
here
again
no
he
says
he
s
one
minute
mamma
please
excuse
he
was
surprised
to
see
you
said
nancy
after
reflecting
he
said
so
but
i
forgot
to
tell
you
in
a
letter
to
baker
i
spoke
of
our
plans
she
had
written
to
me
to
propose
a
pupil
for
after
the
perhaps
she
didn
t
mention
it
to
evidently
not
nancy
exclaimed
with
some
impatience
why
should
you
doubt
his
word
i
can
t
help
thinking
jessica
smiled
archly
that
he
has
come
just
to
meet
somebody
who
do
you
mean
asked
her
friend
with
a
look
of
sincere
astonishment
i
may
be
mistaken
a
glance
completed
the
suggestion
rubbish
for
the
rest
of
that
day
the
subject
was
unmentioned
nancy
kept
rather
to
herself
and
seemed
meditative
next
morning
she
was
in
the
same
mood
the
tide
served
for
a
bathe
at
eleven
o
clock
afterwards
as
the
girls
walked
briskly
to
and
fro
near
the
seat
where
morgan
had
established
herself
with
a
volume
of
browning
jessica
insisted
on
her
reading
browning
though
the
poor
mother
protested
that
she
scarcely
understood
a
word
they
came
full
upon
the
unmistakable
presence
of
lionel
tarrant
miss
morgan
in
acknowledging
his
salute
offered
her
hand
it
was
by
her
that
the
young
man
had
stopped
miss
lord
only
bent
her
head
and
that
slightly
tarrant
expected
more
but
his
hand
dropped
in
time
and
he
directed
his
speech
to
jessica
he
had
nothing
to
say
but
what
seemed
natural
and
civil
the
dialogue
nancy
remained
mute
occupied
but
a
few
minutes
and
tarrant
went
his
way
sauntering
landwards
as
morgan
had
observed
the
meeting
it
was
necessary
to
offer
her
an
explanation
but
jessica
gave
only
the
barest
facts
concerning
their
acquaintance
and
nancy
spoke
as
though
she
hardly
knew
him
the
weather
was
oppressively
hot
in
doors
or
out
little
could
be
done
but
sit
or
lie
in
enervated
attitudes
a
state
of
things
accordant
with
nancy
s
mood
till
late
at
night
she
watched
the
blue
starry
sky
from
her
open
window
seeming
to
reflect
but
in
reality
wafted
on
a
stream
of
fancies
and
emotions
jessica
s
explanation
of
the
arrival
of
lionel
tarrant
had
strangely
startled
her
no
such
suggestion
would
have
occurred
to
her
own
mind
yet
now
she
only
feared
that
it
might
not
be
true
a
debilitating
climate
and
absolute
indolence
favoured
that
impulse
of
lawless
imagination
which
had
first
possessed
her
on
the
evening
of
jubilee
day
with
luxurious
heedlessness
she
cast
aside
every
thought
that
might
have
sobered
her
even
as
she
at
length
cast
off
all
her
garments
and
lay
in
the
warm
midnight
naked
upon
her
bed
the
physical
attraction
of
which
she
had
always
been
conscious
in
tarrant
s
presence
seemed
to
have
grown
stronger
since
she
had
dismissed
him
from
her
mind
comparing
him
with
luckworth
crewe
she
felt
only
a
contemptuous
distaste
for
the
coarse
vitality
and
vigour
whereto
she
had
half
surrendered
herself
when
hopeless
of
the
more
ambitious
desire
rising
early
she
went
out
before
breakfast
and
found
that
a
little
rain
had
fallen
grass
and
flowers
were
freshened
the
air
had
an
exquisite
clearness
and
a
coolness
which
struck
delightfully
on
the
face
after
the
close
atmosphere
within
doors
she
had
paused
to
watch
a
off
shore
when
a
cheery
voice
bade
her
and
tarrant
stepped
to
her
side
you
are
fond
of
this
place
he
said
not
then
why
do
you
choose
it
it
does
for
a
holiday
as
well
as
any
he
was
gazing
at
her
and
with
the
look
which
nancy
resented
the
look
which
made
her
feel
his
social
superiority
he
seemed
to
observe
her
features
with
a
condescending
gratification
though
totally
ignorant
of
his
life
and
habits
she
felt
a
conviction
that
he
had
often
bestowed
this
look
upon
girls
of
a
class
below
his
own
how
do
you
like
those
advertisements
of
soaps
and
pills
along
the
pier
he
asked
carelessly
i
see
no
harm
in
perversity
prompted
her
answer
but
at
once
she
remembered
crewe
and
turned
away
in
annoyance
tarrant
was
only
the
more
you
like
the
world
as
it
is
there
s
wisdom
in
that
better
be
in
harmony
with
one
s
time
advertisements
and
he
added
are
you
reading
for
an
exam
i
you
are
confusing
me
with
miss
oh
not
for
a
moment
i
couldn
t
possibly
confuse
you
with
any
one
else
i
know
miss
morgan
is
studying
professionally
but
i
thought
you
were
reading
for
your
own
satisfaction
as
so
many
women
do
the
distinction
was
flattering
nancy
yielded
to
the
charm
of
his
voice
and
conversed
freely
it
began
to
seem
not
impossible
that
he
found
some
pleasure
in
her
society
now
and
then
he
dropped
a
word
that
made
her
pulses
flutter
his
eyes
were
constantly
upon
her
face
don
t
you
go
off
into
the
country
sometimes
he
inquired
when
she
had
turned
homewards
we
are
thinking
of
having
a
drive
and
i
shall
most
likely
have
a
ride
we
may
nancy
ordered
a
carriage
for
the
afternoon
and
with
her
friends
drove
up
the
teign
valley
but
they
did
not
meet
tarrant
but
next
morning
he
joined
them
on
the
pier
and
this
time
jessica
had
no
choice
but
to
present
him
to
her
mother
nancy
felt
annoyed
that
this
should
have
come
about
tarrant
she
supposed
would
regard
poor
morgan
with
secret
ridicule
yet
if
that
were
his
disposition
he
concealed
it
perfectly
no
one
could
have
behaved
with
more
finished
courtesy
he
seated
himself
by
morgan
and
talked
with
her
of
the
simplest
things
in
a
pleasant
kindly
humour
yesterday
so
he
made
known
he
had
ridden
to
torquay
and
back
returning
after
sunset
this
afternoon
he
was
going
by
train
to
exeter
to
buy
some
books
again
he
strolled
about
with
nancy
and
talked
of
idle
things
with
an
almost
excessive
amiability
as
the
girl
listened
a
languor
crept
upon
her
a
soft
and
delicious
subdual
of
the
will
to
dreamy
luxury
her
eyes
were
fixed
on
the
shadows
cast
by
her
own
figure
and
that
of
her
companion
the
black
patches
by
chance
touched
she
moved
so
as
to
part
them
and
then
changed
her
position
so
that
they
touched
again
so
that
they
blended
chapter
nancy
had
written
to
her
father
a
short
letter
but
affectionate
begging
him
to
let
her
know
whether
the
improvement
in
his
health
of
which
he
had
spoken
before
she
left
home
still
continued
the
answer
came
without
delay
on
the
whole
said
lord
he
was
doing
well
enough
no
need
whatever
to
trouble
about
him
he
wrote
only
a
few
lines
but
closed
with
love
to
you
my
dear
child
an
unwonted
effusiveness
at
the
same
time
there
came
a
letter
from
horace
you
will
be
surprised
it
began
at
the
address
i
write
from
as
you
know
i
had
planned
to
go
to
brighton
but
on
the
day
before
my
holiday
commenced
i
heard
from
saying
that
she
and
peachey
had
had
a
quarrel
and
she
was
tired
of
brighton
and
was
coming
home
so
i
waited
a
day
or
two
and
then
as
i
had
half
promised
i
went
to
see
we
had
a
long
talk
and
it
ended
in
my
telling
her
about
and
all
the
row
there
s
been
perhaps
you
will
think
i
had
better
have
kept
it
to
myself
but
and
i
are
on
terms
and
she
seems
to
understand
me
better
than
any
one
i
ever
met
we
talked
about
my
holiday
and
she
persuaded
me
to
come
to
scarborough
where
she
herself
was
going
for
a
week
or
two
it
s
rather
an
expensive
affair
but
worth
the
money
of
course
i
have
lodgings
of
my
own
is
at
a
big
hotel
where
friends
of
hers
are
staying
i
have
been
introduced
to
two
or
three
people
great
swells
and
i
ve
had
lunch
with
at
the
hotel
twice
this
kind
of
life
suits
me
exactly
i
don
t
think
i
get
on
badly
with
the
swells
of
course
i
say
not
a
word
about
my
position
and
of
course
nobody
would
think
of
asking
questions
you
would
like
this
place
i
rather
wish
you
were
here
of
course
father
thinks
i
have
come
on
my
own
hook
it
s
very
awkward
having
to
keep
a
secret
of
this
kind
i
must
try
and
persuade
to
have
a
talk
with
father
but
one
thing
i
can
tell
you
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
she
will
get
me
somehow
or
other
out
of
that
beastly
city
life
she
s
always
talking
of
things
i
might
do
but
not
a
word
to
any
one
about
all
this
be
this
news
caused
nancy
to
ponder
for
a
long
time
the
greater
part
of
the
morning
she
spent
at
home
and
in
her
own
room
after
lunch
she
sat
idly
on
the
promenade
little
disposed
for
conversation
it
was
the
second
day
since
tarrant
had
told
her
that
he
was
going
to
exeter
and
they
had
not
again
met
the
morgans
had
not
seen
him
either
the
next
morning
however
as
all
three
were
sitting
in
one
of
their
favourite
places
tarrant
approached
them
morgan
who
was
fluttered
by
the
natural
supposition
of
a
love
affair
between
miss
lord
and
the
interesting
young
man
made
it
easy
for
them
to
talk
together
did
you
get
your
books
nancy
asked
when
silence
followed
on
trivialities
yes
and
spent
half
a
day
with
them
in
a
favourite
retreat
of
mine
inland
it
s
a
very
beautiful
spot
i
should
like
you
to
see
it
indeed
you
ought
nancy
turned
her
eyes
to
the
sea
we
might
walk
over
there
one
afternoon
he
added
mrs
morgan
can
t
walk
why
should
we
trouble
her
are
you
obliged
to
remain
under
morgan
s
wing
it
was
said
jestingly
but
nancy
felt
piqued
certainly
not
i
am
quite
so
i
should
have
supposed
then
why
not
come
he
seemed
perfectly
but
the
voice
was
not
quite
his
own
to
nancy
her
eyes
still
looking
straight
forward
it
sounded
as
though
from
a
distance
it
had
an
effect
upon
her
nerves
similar
to
that
she
had
experienced
three
days
ago
when
they
were
walking
about
the
pier
her
hands
fell
idly
she
leaned
back
more
heavily
on
the
seat
a
weight
was
on
her
tongue
a
country
ramble
of
an
hour
or
two
pursued
the
voice
which
itself
had
become
languorous
surely
you
are
sometimes
alone
it
isn
t
necessary
to
give
a
detailed
account
of
your
time
she
answered
impatiently
of
course
in
this
moment
her
thoughts
had
turned
to
luckworth
crewe
and
she
was
asking
herself
why
this
invitation
of
tarrant
s
affected
her
so
very
differently
from
anything
she
had
felt
when
crewe
begged
her
to
meet
him
in
london
with
him
she
could
go
anywhere
enjoying
a
genuine
independence
a
complete
thinking
her
unconventional
behaviour
merely
good
fun
tarrant
s
proposal
startled
her
she
was
not
mistress
of
the
situation
as
when
trifling
with
crewe
a
sense
of
peril
caused
her
heart
to
beat
quickly
this
afternoon
then
the
voice
was
murmuring
she
answered
mechanically
it
s
going
to
rain
i
i
think
not
but
if
so
is
yes
monday
nancy
heard
him
smother
a
laugh
she
wished
to
look
at
him
but
could
not
it
won
t
rain
he
continued
still
with
the
ease
of
one
who
speaks
of
everyday
matters
we
shall
see
at
all
events
perhaps
you
will
want
to
change
your
book
at
the
a
novel
lay
on
her
lap
we
ll
leave
it
an
open
possibility
to
meet
there
about
three
o
nancy
pointed
out
to
sea
and
asked
where
the
steamer
just
passing
might
be
bound
for
her
companion
readily
turned
to
this
subject
the
rain
she
half
hoped
for
it
did
not
come
by
every
doubtful
cloud
had
vanished
before
sitting
down
to
table
she
observed
the
sky
at
the
open
window
lovely
weather
sighed
morgan
behind
her
but
for
you
dear
nancy
i
should
have
been
dreaming
and
wishing
oh
how
vainly
in
the
stifling
we
ll
have
another
drive
this
afternoon
nancy
declared
oh
how
delightful
but
pray
pray
not
on
our
account
jessica
nancy
turned
to
her
friend
who
had
just
entered
the
room
we
ll
have
the
carriage
at
three
and
a
better
horse
than
last
time
i
ll
take
good
care
of
that
pen
ink
and
paper
she
cried
joyously
the
note
shall
go
round
at
you
re
a
magnificent
sort
of
person
said
jessica
some
day
no
doubt
you
ll
keep
a
carriage
and
pair
of
your
shan
t
i
just
and
drive
you
down
to
burlington
house
for
your
exams
does
a
female
bachelor
of
arts
lose
her
degree
if
she
gets
married
nancy
was
sprightlier
than
of
late
her
mood
maintained
itself
throughout
the
first
half
of
the
drive
then
she
seemed
to
be
overcome
by
a
sudden
weariness
ceased
to
talk
and
gave
only
a
listless
look
at
things
which
interested
her
companions
by
when
they
reached
home
again
she
had
a
pale
troubled
countenance
until
dinner
nothing
more
was
seen
of
her
and
after
the
meal
she
soon
excused
herself
on
the
plea
of
a
headache
again
there
passed
two
days
sunday
and
monday
without
tarrant
s
appearing
morgan
and
jessica
privately
talked
much
of
the
circumstance
sentimental
souls
they
found
this
topic
inexhaustible
jessica
having
her
mind
thus
drawn
away
from
burlington
house
benefited
not
a
little
by
the
mystery
of
her
friend
s
position
she
thought
however
that
nancy
might
have
practised
a
less
severe
reticence
to
morgan
it
never
occurred
that
so
a
young
woman
as
miss
lord
stood
in
need
of
matronly
counsel
of
strict
chaperonage
she
would
have
deemed
it
an
impertinence
to
allow
herself
the
most
innocent
remark
implying
such
a
supposition
on
wednesday
afternoon
about
three
o
clock
nancy
walked
alone
to
the
library
there
looking
at
books
and
photographs
in
the
window
stood
lionel
tarrant
he
greeted
her
as
usual
seemed
not
to
remark
the
hot
colour
in
her
cheeks
and
stepped
with
her
into
the
shop
she
had
meant
to
choose
a
novel
but
with
tarrant
looking
on
felt
constrained
to
exhibit
her
capacity
for
severe
reading
the
choice
of
grave
works
was
not
large
and
she
found
it
difficult
to
command
her
thoughts
even
for
the
perusal
of
titles
however
she
ultimately
discovered
a
book
that
promised
anything
but
frivolity
helmholtz
s
lectures
on
scientific
subjects
and
at
this
she
clutched
two
women
were
at
the
same
time
searching
the
shelves
i
wonder
whether
this
is
a
pretty
book
said
one
to
the
other
taking
down
a
trio
of
volumes
oh
it
looks
as
if
it
might
be
pretty
returned
her
friend
examining
the
cover
they
faced
to
the
person
behind
the
counter
is
this
a
pretty
book
one
of
them
inquired
loftily
oh
yes
madam
that
s
a
very
pretty
book
very
nancy
exchanged
a
glance
with
her
companion
and
smiled
when
they
were
outside
again
tarrant
asked
have
you
found
a
pretty
book
she
showed
the
title
of
her
choice
merciful
heavens
you
mean
to
read
that
the
girls
of
what
mere
man
is
worthy
of
them
but
i
must
rise
to
the
occasion
we
ll
have
a
chapter
as
we
insensibly
nancy
had
followed
the
direction
he
chose
his
words
took
for
granted
that
she
was
going
into
the
country
with
him
my
friends
are
on
the
pier
she
said
abruptly
stopping
where
doubtless
they
will
enjoy
themselves
let
me
carry
your
book
please
helmholtz
is
rather
thanks
i
can
carry
it
very
well
i
shall
turn
this
no
no
my
way
this
nancy
stood
still
looking
up
the
street
that
led
towards
the
sea
she
was
still
her
lips
had
a
pathetic
expression
a
pouting
there
was
an
understanding
said
tarrant
with
playful
firmness
not
for
no
for
the
day
when
you
disappointed
me
the
day
after
i
didn
t
think
it
worth
while
to
come
here
yesterday
i
came
but
felt
no
surprise
that
i
didn
t
meet
you
i
had
a
sort
of
hope
this
she
followed
and
they
walked
for
several
minutes
in
silence
will
you
let
me
look
at
helmholtz
said
the
young
man
at
length
most
excellent
book
of
course
physiological
causes
of
harmony
in
music
interaction
of
natural
forces
conservation
of
you
enjoy
this
kind
of
thing
one
must
know
something
about
i
suppose
so
i
used
to
grind
at
science
because
everybody
talked
science
in
reality
i
loathed
it
and
now
i
read
only
what
i
like
life
s
too
short
for
intellectual
it
is
too
short
for
anything
but
enjoyment
tell
me
what
you
read
for
pure
pleasure
poetry
they
had
left
the
streets
and
were
pursuing
a
road
bordered
with
gardens
gardens
of
glowing
colour
sheltered
amid
great
laurels
shadowed
by
stately
trees
the
air
was
laden
with
warm
scents
of
flower
and
leaf
on
an
instinct
of
resistance
nancy
pretended
that
the
exact
sciences
were
her
favourite
study
she
said
it
in
the
tone
of
superiority
which
habit
had
made
natural
to
her
in
speaking
of
intellectual
things
and
tarrant
appeared
to
accept
her
declaration
without
scepticism
but
a
moment
after
he
turned
the
talk
upon
novels
thus
for
half
an
hour
and
more
they
strolled
on
by
upward
ways
until
teignmouth
lay
beneath
them
and
the
stillness
of
meadows
all
about
presently
tarrant
led
from
the
beaten
road
into
a
lane
all
but
overgrown
with
grass
he
began
to
gather
flowers
and
offered
them
to
nancy
personal
conversation
seemed
at
an
end
they
were
enjoying
the
brilliant
sky
and
the
peaceful
loveliness
of
earth
they
exchanged
simple
natural
thoughts
or
idle
words
in
which
was
no
thought
at
all
before
long
they
came
to
an
old
broken
gate
half
open
it
was
the
entrance
to
a
narrow
cartway
now
unused
which
descended
windingly
between
high
thick
hedges
ruts
of
a
foot
in
depth
baked
hard
by
summer
showed
how
miry
the
track
must
be
in
the
season
of
rain
this
is
our
way
said
tarrant
his
hand
on
the
lichened
wood
better
than
the
pier
or
the
promenade
don
t
you
think
but
we
have
gone
far
nancy
drew
back
into
the
lane
looked
at
her
flowers
and
then
shaded
her
eyes
with
them
to
gaze
upward
almost
another
five
minutes
and
you
will
see
the
place
i
told
you
of
you
can
t
imagine
how
beautiful
it
another
day
we
are
all
but
there
he
seemed
regretfully
to
yield
and
nancy
yielded
in
her
turn
she
felt
a
sudden
shame
in
the
thought
of
having
perhaps
betrayed
timidity
without
speaking
she
passed
the
gate
the
hedge
on
either
side
was
of
hazel
and
dwarf
oak
of
hawthorn
and
blackthorn
all
intertwined
with
giant
brambles
and
with
briers
which
here
and
there
met
overhead
high
and
low
blackberries
hung
in
multitudes
swelling
to
purple
ripeness
numberless
the
trailing
and
climbing
plants
nancy
s
skirts
rustled
among
the
greenery
her
cheeks
were
touched
as
if
with
a
caress
by
many
a
drooping
branchlet
in
places
tarrant
had
to
hold
the
tangle
above
her
while
she
stooped
to
pass
and
from
this
they
emerged
into
a
small
circular
space
where
the
cartway
made
a
turn
at
right
angles
and
disappeared
behind
thickets
they
were
in
the
midst
of
a
plantation
on
every
side
trees
closed
about
them
with
a
low
and
irregular
hedge
to
mark
the
borders
of
the
grassy
road
nancy
s
eyes
fell
at
once
upon
a
cluster
of
magnificent
foxgloves
growing
upon
a
bank
which
rose
to
the
foot
of
an
old
elm
beside
the
foxgloves
lay
a
trunk
bedded
in
the
ground
thickly
overgrown
with
mosses
lichens
and
small
fungi
have
i
misled
you
said
tarrant
watching
her
face
with
frank
pleasure
no
indeed
you
haven
t
this
is
very
beautiful
i
discovered
it
last
year
and
spent
hours
here
alone
i
couldn
t
ask
you
to
come
and
see
it
then
he
added
laughing
it
is
delightful
here
s
your
seat
who
knows
how
many
years
it
has
waited
for
you
she
sat
down
upon
the
old
trunk
about
the
roots
of
the
elm
above
grew
masses
of
fern
and
beneath
it
a
rough
bit
of
the
bank
was
clothed
with
pennywort
the
green
discs
and
yellowing
fruity
spires
making
an
exquisite
patch
of
colour
in
the
shadow
of
bushes
near
at
hand
hartstongue
abounded
with
fronds
hanging
to
the
length
of
an
arm
now
said
tarrant
gaily
you
shall
have
some
blackberries
and
he
went
to
gather
them
returning
in
a
few
minutes
with
a
large
leaf
full
he
saw
that
nancy
meanwhile
had
taken
up
the
book
from
where
he
dropped
it
to
the
ground
it
lay
open
on
her
lap
helmholtz
away
with
him
no
i
have
opened
at
something
she
spoke
as
though
possession
of
the
book
were
of
vital
importance
to
her
nevertheless
the
fruit
was
accepted
and
she
drew
off
her
gloves
to
eat
it
tarrant
seated
himself
on
the
ground
near
her
and
gradually
fell
into
a
attitude
won
t
you
have
any
nancy
asked
without
looking
at
him
one
or
two
if
you
will
give
me
she
chose
a
fine
blackberry
and
held
it
out
tarrant
let
it
fall
into
his
palm
and
murmured
you
have
a
beautiful
when
a
moment
after
he
glanced
at
her
she
seemed
to
be
reading
helmholtz
the
calm
of
the
golden
afternoon
could
not
have
been
more
profound
birds
twittered
softly
in
the
wood
and
if
a
leaf
rustled
it
was
only
at
the
touch
of
wings
earth
breathed
its
many
perfumes
upon
the
slumberous
air
you
know
said
tarrant
after
a
long
pause
and
speaking
as
though
he
feared
to
break
the
hush
that
keats
once
stayed
at
nancy
did
not
know
it
but
said
the
name
of
keats
was
familiar
to
her
but
of
his
life
she
knew
hardly
anything
of
his
poetry
very
little
her
education
had
been
chiefly
concerned
with
names
will
you
read
me
a
paragraph
of
helmholtz
continued
the
other
looking
at
her
with
a
smile
any
paragraph
the
one
before
she
hesitated
but
read
at
length
in
an
unsteady
voice
something
about
the
conservation
of
force
it
ended
in
a
nervous
laugh
now
i
ll
read
something
to
you
said
tarrant
and
he
began
to
repeat
slowly
musically
lines
of
verse
which
his
companion
had
never
heard
what
can
ail
thee
alone
and
palely
loitering
the
sedge
has
wither
d
from
the
lake
and
no
birds
he
went
through
the
poem
nancy
the
while
did
not
stir
it
was
as
though
he
murmured
melody
for
his
own
pleasure
rather
than
recited
to
a
listener
but
no
word
was
inaudible
nancy
knew
that
his
eyes
rested
upon
her
she
wished
to
smile
yet
could
not
and
when
he
ceased
the
silence
held
her
motionless
isn
t
it
better
said
tarrant
drawing
slightly
nearer
to
her
of
course
it
i
used
to
know
thousands
of
verses
by
did
you
ever
write
any
epics
or
so
when
i
was
about
seventeen
yet
i
don
t
come
of
a
poetical
family
my
father
he
stopped
abruptly
looked
into
nancy
s
face
with
a
smile
and
said
in
a
tone
of
playfulness
do
you
remember
asking
me
whether
i
had
anything
to
do
with
nancy
flushing
over
all
her
features
exclaimed
don
t
please
don
t
i
m
ashamed
of
myself
i
didn
t
like
it
but
we
know
each
other
better
now
you
were
quite
right
that
was
how
my
grandfather
made
his
money
my
father
i
believe
got
through
most
of
it
and
gave
no
particular
thought
to
me
his
mother
the
old
lady
whom
you
know
had
plenty
of
her
own
to
be
mine
she
tells
me
some
day
do
you
wish
to
be
forgiven
for
hurting
my
pride
he
added
i
don
t
know
what
made
me
say
such
a
thing
she
faltered
the
words
she
felt
her
will
subdued
tarrant
reached
a
hand
and
took
one
of
hers
and
kissed
it
then
allowed
her
to
draw
it
away
now
will
you
give
me
another
blackberry
the
girl
was
trembling
a
light
shone
in
her
eyes
she
offered
the
leaf
with
fruit
in
it
tarrant
whilst
choosing
touched
the
blue
veins
of
her
wrist
with
his
lips
what
are
you
going
to
do
she
asked
presently
i
mean
what
do
you
aim
at
in
life
enjoyment
why
should
i
trouble
about
anything
else
i
should
be
content
if
life
were
all
like
this
to
look
at
a
beautiful
face
and
listen
to
a
voice
that
charms
me
and
touch
a
hand
that
makes
me
thrill
with
such
pleasure
as
i
never
it
s
waste
of
oh
never
time
was
spent
so
well
look
at
me
again
like
that
with
the
eyes
and
the
lips
oh
the
exquisite
lips
if
i
might
if
i
might
he
did
not
stir
from
his
posture
of
languid
ease
but
nancy
with
a
quick
movement
drew
a
little
away
from
him
then
rose
it
s
time
to
go
back
she
said
absently
no
no
not
yet
let
me
look
at
you
for
a
few
minutes
more
she
began
to
walk
slowly
head
bent
well
then
or
the
day
after
the
place
will
be
just
as
beautiful
and
you
even
more
the
makes
you
lovelier
from
day
to
nancy
looked
back
for
an
instant
tarrant
followed
and
in
the
deep
leafy
way
he
again
helped
her
to
pass
the
briers
but
their
hands
never
touched
and
the
silence
was
unbroken
until
they
had
issued
into
the
open
lane
chapter
the
lodgings
were
taken
for
three
weeks
and
more
than
half
the
time
had
now
elapsed
jessica
who
declared
herself
quite
well
and
strong
again
though
her
face
did
not
bear
out
the
assertion
was
beginning
to
talk
of
matters
examinational
once
more
notwithstanding
protests
she
brought
forth
from
their
sundry
arid
little
manuals
and
notebooks
her
thoughts
were
divided
between
algebraic
formulae
and
nancy
s
relations
with
lionel
tarrant
perhaps
because
no
secret
was
confided
to
her
she
affected
more
appetite
for
the
arid
little
books
than
she
really
felt
nancy
would
neither
speak
of
examinations
nor
give
ear
when
they
were
talked
about
she
whether
consciously
or
not
was
making
haste
to
graduate
in
quite
another
school
on
the
morning
after
her
long
walk
with
tarrant
she
woke
before
sunrise
and
before
seven
o
clock
had
left
the
house
a
high
wind
and
hurrying
clouds
made
the
weather
prospects
uncertain
she
strayed
about
the
den
never
losing
sight
for
more
than
a
minute
or
two
of
the
house
where
tarrant
lived
but
no
familiar
form
approached
her
and
she
had
to
return
to
breakfast
unrewarded
for
early
rising
through
the
day
she
was
restless
and
silent
kept
alone
as
much
as
possible
and
wore
a
look
which
as
the
hours
went
on
darkened
from
anxiety
to
she
went
to
bed
much
earlier
than
usual
at
eleven
next
morning
having
lingered
behind
her
friends
she
found
tarrant
in
conversation
with
morgan
and
jessica
on
the
pier
his
greeting
astonished
her
it
had
precisely
the
gracious
formality
of
a
year
ago
a
word
or
two
about
the
weather
and
he
resumed
his
talk
with
miss
morgan
its
subject
the
educational
value
of
the
classics
obliged
to
listen
nancy
suffered
an
anguish
of
resentful
passion
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
kept
silence
then
saw
the
young
man
take
leave
and
saunter
away
with
that
air
which
in
satire
she
had
formerly
styled
majestic
and
then
passed
three
whole
days
during
which
lionel
was
not
seen
the
evening
of
the
fourth
between
eight
and
nine
o
clock
found
nancy
at
the
door
of
the
house
which
her
thoughts
had
a
thousand
times
visited
a
servant
in
reply
to
inquiry
told
her
that
mr
tarrant
was
in
london
he
would
probably
return
she
walked
idly
away
and
at
less
than
a
hundred
yards
distance
met
tarrant
himself
his
costume
showed
that
he
had
just
come
from
the
railway
station
nancy
would
gladly
have
walked
straight
past
him
but
the
tone
in
which
he
addressed
her
was
a
new
surprise
and
she
stood
in
helpless
confusion
he
had
been
to
london
called
away
on
sudden
business
i
thought
of
writing
nay
i
did
write
but
after
all
didn
t
post
the
letter
for
a
very
simple
reason
i
couldn
t
remember
your
and
he
laughed
so
naturally
that
the
captive
walked
on
by
his
side
unresisting
their
conversation
lasted
only
a
few
minutes
then
nancy
resolutely
bade
him
no
appointment
made
for
the
morrow
a
day
of
showers
then
a
day
of
excessive
heat
they
saw
each
other
several
times
but
nothing
of
moment
passed
the
morning
after
they
met
before
breakfast
is
our
last
day
said
nancy
yes
morgan
told
nancy
herself
had
never
spoken
of
departure
this
afternoon
we
ll
go
up
the
hill
i
don
t
think
i
shall
care
to
walk
so
far
look
at
the
mist
it
s
going
to
be
dreadfully
hot
tarrant
was
in
a
mood
of
careless
gaiety
his
companion
appeared
to
struggle
against
listlessness
and
her
cheek
had
lost
its
wonted
colour
you
have
tea
at
four
or
five
i
suppose
let
us
go
after
that
when
the
heat
of
the
day
is
to
this
after
various
objections
nancy
consented
through
the
hours
of
glaring
sunshine
she
stayed
at
home
lying
inert
by
an
open
window
over
the
she
was
amiable
but
dreamy
when
ready
to
go
out
she
just
looked
into
the
where
jessica
bent
over
books
and
said
cheerfully
i
may
be
a
little
late
for
dinner
on
no
account
wait
i
forbid
it
and
so
without
listening
to
the
answer
she
hurried
away
in
the
upward
climbing
lanes
no
breeze
yet
tempered
the
still
air
the
sky
of
misted
sapphire
showed
not
a
cloud
from
verge
to
verge
tarrant
as
if
to
make
up
for
his
companion
s
silence
talked
ceaselessly
and
always
in
light
vein
sunshine
he
said
was
indispensable
to
his
life
he
never
passed
the
winter
in
london
if
he
were
the
poorest
of
mortals
he
would
at
all
events
beg
his
bread
in
a
sunny
clime
are
you
going
to
the
bahamas
this
winter
nancy
asked
mentioning
the
matter
for
the
first
time
since
she
heard
of
it
at
champion
hill
i
don
t
know
everything
is
and
he
put
the
question
aside
as
if
it
were
of
no
importance
they
passed
the
old
gate
and
breathed
with
relief
in
the
shadow
of
tangled
foliage
whilst
pushing
a
bramble
aside
tarrant
let
his
free
arm
fall
lightly
on
nancy
s
waist
at
once
she
sprang
forward
but
without
appearing
to
notice
what
had
happened
stay
did
you
ever
see
such
ivy
as
this
it
was
a
mass
of
large
lustrous
leaves
concealing
a
rotten
trunk
whilst
nancy
looked
on
tarrant
pulled
at
a
long
stem
and
tried
to
break
it
away
i
must
cut
why
you
shall
he
wove
three
stems
into
a
wreath
there
now
take
off
your
hat
and
let
me
crown
you
have
i
made
it
too
large
for
the
little
head
nancy
after
a
moment
s
reluctance
unfastened
her
hat
and
stood
bareheaded
blushing
and
laughing
you
do
your
hair
in
the
right
way
the
greek
way
a
diadem
on
the
top
the
only
way
when
the
hair
and
the
head
are
beautiful
it
leaves
the
outline
free
the
exquisite
curve
that
unites
neck
and
head
now
the
ivy
wreath
and
how
will
you
look
she
wore
a
dress
of
thin
creamy
material
which
whilst
seeming
to
cumber
her
as
little
as
garments
could
yet
fitted
closely
enough
to
declare
the
healthy
beauty
of
her
form
the
dark
green
garland
for
which
she
bent
a
little
became
her
admirably
i
pictured
it
in
my
letter
said
tarrant
the
letter
you
never
where
is
it
oh
i
burnt
tell
me
what
was
in
all
sorts
of
things
a
long
i
think
that
s
all
nonsense
about
forgetting
my
mere
truth
in
fact
i
never
knew
be
so
good
as
to
tell
me
she
spoke
as
she
walked
on
before
him
what
you
meant
by
your
behaviour
that
morning
before
you
went
to
but
how
did
i
behave
very
tarrant
affected
not
to
understand
but
when
she
again
turned
nancy
saw
a
mischievous
smile
on
his
face
a
bit
of
shall
i
tell
you
he
stepped
near
and
suddenly
caught
both
her
hands
one
of
them
was
trailing
her
sunshade
forgive
me
in
advance
will
you
i
don
t
know
about
and
she
tried
though
faintly
to
get
free
but
i
will
make
you
now
refuse
his
lips
had
just
touched
hers
just
touched
and
no
more
rosy
red
she
trembled
before
him
with
drooping
eyelids
it
meant
nothing
at
all
really
he
pursued
his
voice
at
its
softest
a
sham
trial
to
see
whether
i
was
hopelessly
conquered
or
not
of
course
i
nancy
shook
her
head
you
dare
to
doubt
it
i
understand
now
what
the
old
poet
meant
when
he
talked
of
bees
seeking
honey
on
his
lady
s
lips
that
fancy
isn
t
so
artificial
as
it
that
s
all
very
pretty
she
spoke
between
quick
breaths
and
tried
to
laugh
but
you
have
thrown
my
hat
on
the
ground
give
it
me
and
take
the
ivy
for
i
am
no
he
tossed
the
wreath
aside
take
the
hat
i
like
you
in
it
just
as
you
shall
have
a
girdle
of
woodbine
i
don
t
believe
your
explanation
said
nancy
not
believe
me
with
feigned
indignation
he
moved
to
capture
her
again
but
nancy
escaped
her
hat
in
her
hand
she
darted
forward
a
minute
s
run
brought
her
into
the
open
space
and
there
with
an
exclamation
of
surprise
she
stopped
tarrant
but
a
step
or
two
behind
her
saw
at
almost
the
same
moment
the
spectacle
which
had
arrested
her
flight
before
them
stood
two
little
donkeys
munching
eagerly
at
a
crop
of
thistles
they
the
human
beings
looked
at
each
other
tarrant
burst
into
extravagant
laughter
and
nancy
joined
him
neither
s
mirth
was
spontaneous
nancy
s
had
a
note
of
nervous
tension
a
ring
of
something
like
recklessness
where
can
they
come
from
she
asked
they
must
have
strayed
a
long
way
i
haven
t
seen
any
farm
or
but
perhaps
some
one
is
with
them
wait
i
ll
go
on
a
little
and
see
if
some
boy
is
hanging
he
turned
the
sharp
corner
and
disappeared
for
two
or
three
minutes
nancy
stood
alone
watching
the
patient
little
grey
beasts
whose
pendent
ears
with
many
a
turn
and
twitch
expressed
their
joy
in
the
feast
of
thistles
she
watched
them
in
seeming
only
her
eyes
beheld
nothing
a
voice
sounded
from
behind
her
nancy
startled
she
saw
tarrant
standing
high
up
in
a
gap
of
the
hedge
on
the
bank
which
bordered
the
wood
how
did
you
get
there
went
he
showed
the
direction
with
his
hand
i
can
see
no
one
but
somebody
may
come
it
s
wonderful
here
among
the
trees
come
how
can
i
we
will
drive
the
donkeys
no
it
s
much
better
here
a
wild
wood
full
of
wonderful
things
the
bank
isn
t
too
steep
give
me
your
hand
and
you
can
step
up
easily
just
at
this
she
drew
near
your
sunshade
oh
it
s
too
much
trouble
she
said
languidly
all
but
plaintively
i
d
rather
be
obey
your
sunshade
she
gave
it
now
your
he
was
kneeling
on
the
top
of
the
bank
with
very
little
exertion
nancy
found
herself
beside
him
then
he
at
once
leapt
down
among
the
brushwood
a
descent
of
some
three
feet
we
shall
be
trespassing
said
nancy
what
do
i
care
now
jump
as
if
you
could
catch
me
again
she
uttered
her
nervous
laugh
i
am
obey
jump
he
cried
impatiently
his
eyes
afire
she
knelt
seated
herself
dropped
forward
tarrant
caught
her
in
his
arms
you
heavy
a
feather
weight
why
i
can
carry
you
i
could
run
with
and
he
did
carry
her
through
the
brushwood
away
into
the
shadow
of
the
trees
at
morgan
and
her
daughter
were
alone
they
agreed
to
wait
a
quarter
of
an
hour
and
sat
silent
pretending
each
to
be
engaged
with
a
book
at
length
their
eyes
met
what
does
it
mean
jessica
asked
the
mother
timidly
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
it
doesn
t
concern
us
she
didn
t
mean
to
be
back
by
what
she
but
isn
t
it
rather

the
two

in

voices

but
distressed

jessica
i
can
t
help
feeling
a
responsibility
after
all
nancy

quite
a
young
girl
and
i
ve
sometimes
thought
she
might
be
hush
that
was
a
they
waited
in
a
minute
or
two
the
door
was
opened
a
few
inches
and
a
voice
called
jessica
she
responded
nancy
was
standing
in
the
gloom
come
into
my
room
she
said
curtly
arrived
there
she
did
not
strike
a
light
she
closed
the
door
and
took
hold
of
her
friend
s
arm
we

go

day
after

truth

best
friend
for

long
time

whisper
and

trembling

i
believe

and
part
iii
into
bontage
chapter
during
his
daughter
s
absence
stephen
lord
led
a
miserable
life
the
wasting
disease
had
firm
hold
upon
him
day
by
day
it
consumed
his
flesh
darkened
his
mind
the
more
need
he
had
of
nursing
and
restraint
the
less
could
he
tolerate
interference
with
his
habits
invasion
of
his
gloomy
solitude
the
doctor
s
visits
availed
nothing
he
listened
to
advice
or
seemed
to
listen
but
with
a
smile
of
obstinate
suspicion
on
his
furrowed
face
which
conveyed
too
plain
a
meaning
to
the
adviser
on
one
point
mary
had
prevailed
with
him
after
some
days
resistance
he
allowed
her
to
transform
the
arrangements
of
his
room
and
give
it
the
appearance
of
a
comfortable
but
he
would
not
take
to
his
bed
and
the
suggestion
of
professional
nursing
excited
his
wrath
do
you
write
to
nancy
he
asked
one
morning
of
his
faithful
attendant
with
scowling
suspicion
you
are
telling
me
the
truth
i
never
write
to
any
understand
plainly
that
i
won
t
have
a
word
said
to
her
about
this
was
when
horace
had
gone
away
to
scarborough
believing
on
his
father
s
assurance
that
there
was
no
ground
whatever
for
anxiety
sometimes
lord
sat
hour
after
hour
in
an
unchanging
position
his
dull
eyes
scarcely
moving
from
one
point
at
others
he
paced
his
room
or
wandered
about
the
house
or
made
an
attempt
at
gardening
which
soon
ended
in
pain
and
exhaustion
towards
night
he
became
feverish
his
hollow
cheeks
glowing
with
an
ominous
tint
in
the
morning
he
occasionally
prepared
himself
as
if
to
start
for
his
place
of
business
he
left
the
house
and
walked
for
perhaps
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
then
slackened
his
pace
stopped
looked
about
him
in
an
agony
of
indecision
and
at
length
returned
after
this
futile
endeavour
he
had
recourse
to
the
bottles
in
his
cupboard
and
presently
fell
into
a
troubled
sleep
at
the
end
of
the
second
week
early
one
evening
three
persons
came
to
him
by
appointment
his
partner
samuel
barmby
barmby
senior
and
a
gentleman
whom
mary
she
opened
the
door
to
them
had
never
seen
before
they
sat
together
in
the
for
more
than
an
hour
then
the
gentleman
took
his
leave
the
others
remaining
for
some
time
longer
the
promoted
servant
at
lord
s
bidding
had
made
a
change
in
her
dress
during
the
latter
part
of
the
day
she
presented
the
appearance
of
a
gentlewoman
and
sat
generally
with
needlework
sometimes
with
a
book
alone
in
the
on
a
sunday
whilst
nancy
and
her
brother
were
away
the
barmby
family
father
son
and
two
daughters
came
to
take
tea
and
spend
the
evening
mary
doing
the
honours
of
the
house
she
bore
herself
without
awkwardness
talked
simply
and
altogether
justified
lord
s
opinion
of
her
when
the
guests
were
gone
stephen
made
no
remark
but
in
saying
to
her
smiled
for
an
instant
the
first
smile
seen
upon
his
face
for
many
days
mary
remained
ignorant
of
the
disease
from
which
he
was
suffering
in
the
matter
of
his
diet
she
consulted
and
obeyed
him
though
often
enough
it
seemed
to
her
that
his
choice
suited
little
with
the
state
of
an
invalid
he
ate
at
irregular
times
and
frequently
like
a
starving
man
mary
suspected
that
on
the
occasions
when
he
went
out
for
after
dark
he
brought
back
food
with
him
she
had
seen
him
enter
with
something
concealed
beneath
his
coat
all
his
doings
were
to
her
a
subject
of
ceaseless
anxiety
of
a
profound
distress
which
in
his
presence
she
was
obliged
to
conceal
if
she
regarded
him
sadly
the
sufferer
grew
petulant
or
irate
he
would
not
endure
a
question
concerning
his
health
on
the
day
which
was
understood
to
be
nancy
s
last
at
teignmouth
he
brightened
a
little
and
talked
with
pleasure
as
it
seemed
of
her
return
on
the
morrow
horace
had
written
that
he
would
be
home
this
evening
but
lord
spoke
only
of
his
daughter
at
about
six
o
clock
he
was
sitting
in
the
garden
and
mary
brought
him
a
letter
just
delivered
he
looked
at
the
envelope
with
a
smile
to
tell
us
the
train
she
s
coming
by
no
mary
waited
when
lord
had
read
the
brief
note
his
face
darkened
first
with
disappointment
then
with
anger
here
look
at
it
he
said
harshly
what
else
was
to
be
expected
dearest
father
wrote
nancy
i
am
sorry
that
our
return
must
be
put
off
we
hope
to
get
back
on
friday
evening
of
course
this
will
make
no
difference
to
with
best
love
dear
father
and
hoping
i
shall
find
you
much
better
what
does
she
mean
by
behaving
in
this
way
resumed
the
angry
voice
before
mary
had
read
to
the
end
what
does
she
mean
by
it
who
gave
her
leave
to
stay
longer
not
a
word
of
explanation
how
does
she
know
it
will
make
no
difference
to
me
what
does
she
mean
by
it
the
fine
weather
has
tempted
them
replied
mary
i
daresay
they
want
to
go
what
right
has
she
to
make
the
change
at
a
moment
s
notice
vociferated
the
father
his
voice
suddenly
recovering
its
old
power
his
cheeks
and
neck
suffused
with
red
wrath
and
hopes
she
will
find
me
better
what
does
care
whether
she
finds
me
alive
or
dead
oh
don
t
say
that
you
wouldn
t
let
her
know
that
you
were
what
does
it
mean
i
hate
this
deceitful
behaviour
she
knew
before
of
course
she
knew
and
she
left
it
to
the
last
moment
so
that
i
couldn
t
write
and
prevent
her
from
staying
as
if
i
should
have
wished
to
as
if
i
cared
a
brass
farthing
how
long
she
stays
or
for
that
matter
whether
i
ever
see
her
again
he
checked
the
course
of
his
furious
speech
and
stood
staring
at
the
letter
what
did
you
say
he
spoke
now
in
a
hoarse
undertone
you
thought
they
were
going
somewhere
last
year
there
used
to
be
steamers
that
went
to
places
on
certain
days
nonsense
she
wouldn
t
alter
all
their
plans
for
that
it
s
something
i
am
not
to
know
of
course
it
is
she
s
deceitful
like
all
he
met
mary
s
eye
suddenly
turned
upon
him
his
own
fell
before
it
and
without
speaking
again
he
went
into
the
house
in
s
time
his
bell
rang
and
not
mary
but
the
young
servant
responded
according
to
her
directions
she
knocked
at
the
door
and
without
opening
it
asked
her
master
s
pleasure
lord
said
that
he
was
going
out
and
would
not
require
a
meal
till
late
in
the
evening
it
was
nearly
ten
o
clock
when
he
returned
mary
sitting
in
the
front
room
rose
at
his
entrance
i
want
nothing
he
said
i
ve
been
to
the
barmbys
voice
and
movements
proved
how
the
effort
had
taxed
him
in
sitting
down
he
trembled
fever
was
in
his
eyes
and
pain
in
every
line
of
his
countenance
mary
handed
him
a
letter
it
came
from
horace
and
was
an
intimation
that
the
young
gentleman
would
not
return
but
when
lord
had
read
it
he
jerked
a
contemptuous
laugh
and
threw
the
sheet
of
across
the
table
there
you
are
not
much
to
choose
between
daughter
and
son
he
s
due
at
business
in
the
morning
but
what
does
that
matter
it
doesn
t
suit
his
lordship
to
keep
he
laughed
again
his
emphasis
on
lordship
showing
that
he
consciously
played
with
the
family
name
but
i
was
a
fool
to
be
angry
let
them
come
when
they
for
a
few
minutes
he
lay
back
in
the
chair
gazing
at
vacancy
has
the
girl
gone
to
bed
i
ll
tell
her
she
can
mary
soon
returned
and
took
up
the
book
with
which
she
had
been
engaged
in
a
low
voice
and
as
if
speaking
without
much
thought
stephen
asked
her
what
she
was
reading
it
was
a
volume
of
an
old
magazine
bought
by
lord
many
years
ago
yes
yes
nancy
laughs
at
it
calls
it
old
rubbish
these
young
people
are
so
his
companion
made
no
remark
unobserved
he
scrutinised
her
face
for
a
long
time
and
said
at
length
don
t
let
fall
out
mary
you
re
not
pleased
with
me
and
i
know
why
i
said
all
women
were
deceitful
and
you
took
it
too
seriously
you
ought
to
know
me
better
there
s
something
comes
on
me
every
now
and
then
and
makes
me
say
the
worst
i
can
no
matter
who
it
hurts
could
i
be
such
a
fool
as
to
think
ill
of
it
did
hurt
me
replied
the
other
still
bent
over
her
book
but
it
was
only
the
sound
of
it
i
knew
you
said
more
than
you
i
m
a
fool
and
i
ve
been
a
fool
all
my
life
is
it
likely
i
should
have
wise
children
when
i
went
off
to
the
barmbys
i
thought
of
sending
samuel
down
to
teignmouth
to
find
out
what
they
were
at
but
i
altered
my
mind
before
i
got
there
what
good
would
it
have
done
all
i
do
i
ve
done
already
i
made
my
will
the
other
day
it
s
signed
and
witnessed
i
ve
made
it
as
i
told
you
i
should
i
m
not
much
longer
for
this
world
but
i
ve
saved
the
girl
from
foolishness
till
she
s
after
that
she
must
take
care
of
they
sat
silent
whilst
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
ticked
away
a
few
more
minutes
lord
s
features
betrayed
the
working
of
turbid
thought
a
stern
resentment
their
prevailing
expression
when
reverie
released
him
he
again
looked
at
his
companion
mary
did
you
ever
ask
yourself
what
sort
of
woman
nancy
s
mother
may
have
been
the
listener
started
like
one
in
whom
a
secret
has
been
surprised
she
tried
to
answer
but
after
all
did
not
speak
i
ll
tell
you
stephen
pursued
yes
i
ll
tell
you
you
must
know
it
not
a
year
after
the
boy
s
birth
she
left
me
and
i
made
myself
free
of
her
i
divorced
their
eyes
just
met
you
needn
t
think
that
it
cost
me
any
suffering
not
on
her
account
not
because
i
had
lost
my
wife
i
never
felt
so
glad
before
or
since
as
on
the
day
when
it
was
all
over
and
i
found
myself
a
free
man
again
i
suffered
only
in
thinking
how
i
had
fooled
away
some
of
the
best
years
of
my
life
for
a
woman
who
despised
me
from
the
first
and
was
as
heartless
as
the
stones
of
the
street
i
found
her
in
beggary
or
close
upon
it
i
made
myself
her
slave
it
s
only
the
worthless
women
who
accept
from
a
man
who
expect
from
him
such
slavish
worship
as
she
had
from
me
i
gave
her
clothing
she
scarcely
thanked
me
but
i
thought
myself
happy
i
gave
her
a
comfortable
home
such
as
she
hadn
t
known
for
years
for
a
reward
she
mocked
at
my
plain
tastes
and
quiet
ways
but
i
thought
no
ill
of
it
could
see
nothing
in
it
but
a
girlish
lighthearted
sort
of
way
that
seemed
one
of
her
merits
as
long
as
we
lived
together
she
pretended
to
be
an
affectionate
wife
i
should
think
no
one
ever
matched
her
in
hypocrisy
but
the
first
chance
she
had
husband
children
home
all
flung
aside
in
a
moment
then
i
saw
her
in
the
true
light
and
understood
all
at
once
what
a
blind
fool
i
had
he
breathed
quickly
and
painfully
mary
sat
without
a
movement
i
thought
i
had
done
a
great
thing
in
marrying
a
wife
that
was
born
above
me
her
father
had
been
a
country
gentleman
and
such
things
had
brought
him
down
and
from
her
twelfth
year
his
daughter
lived
i
never
quite
knew
how
but
on
charity
of
some
kind
she
grew
up
without
trying
to
earn
her
own
living
she
thought
herself
too
good
for
that
thought
she
had
a
claim
to
be
supported
because
as
a
child
she
was
waited
upon
by
servants
when
i
asked
her
once
if
she
couldn
t
have
done
something
she
stared
at
me
and
laughed
in
my
face
for
all
that
she
was
glad
enough
to
marry
a
man
of
my
sort
rough
and
uneducated
as
i
was
she
always
reminded
me
of
it
though
that
i
had
no
education
i
believe
she
thought
that
she
had
a
perfect
right
to
throw
over
such
a
husband
whenever
she
chose
afterwards
i
saw
very
well
that
education
didn
t
amount
to
much
how
could
it
when
she
learnt
nothing
after
she
was
twelve
she
was
living
with
very
poor
people
who
came
from
my
part
of
the
country
that
s
how
i
met
her
the
father
led
some
sort
of
blackguard
life
in
london
but
had
no
money
for
her
nor
yet
for
his
other
girl
who
went
into
service
i
was
told
and
perhaps
made
herself
a
useful
honest
woman
he
died
in
a
hospital
and
he
was
buried
at
my
expense
not
three
months
before
his
daughter
went
off
and
left
you
will
never
tell
your
children
said
mary
when
there
had
been
a
long
pause
i
ve
often
thought
it
would
only
be
right
if
i
told
them
i
ve
often
thought
the
last
year
or
two
that
nancy
ought
to
know
it
might
make
her
think
and
do
her
no
no
returned
the
other
hurriedly
never
let
her
know
of
it
never
it
might
do
her
much
you
know
now
mary
why
i
look
at
the
girl
so
anxiously
she
s
not
like
her
mother
not
much
like
her
in
face
and
i
can
t
think
she
s
like
her
in
heart
but
you
know
what
her
faults
are
as
well
as
i
do
whether
i
ve
been
right
or
wrong
in
giving
her
a
good
education
i
shall
never
know
wrong
i
fear
but
i
ve
told
you
all
about
you
don
t
know
whether
she
s
alive
or
not
asked
mary
when
once
more
it
was
left
to
her
to
break
silence
what
do
i
care
how
should
i
know
don
t
be
tempted
to
tell
them
either
of
them
said
the
other
earnestly
my
friend
barmby
knows
whether
he
s
told
his
son
i
can
t
say
it
s
twenty
years
since
we
spoke
about
it
if
he
ever
mention
it
to
samuel
then
it
might
somehow
get
known
to
horace
or
the
girl
when
i
m
i
won
t
give
up
the
hope
that
young
barmby
may
be
her
husband
she
ll
have
time
to
think
about
it
but
if
ever
she
should
come
to
you
and
ask
questions
i
mean
if
she
s
been
told
what
happened
you
ll
set
me
right
in
her
eyes
you
ll
tell
her
what
i
ve
told
you
i
hope
it
may
never
so
do
i
stephen
interrupted
his
voice
husky
with
fatigue
but
i
count
on
you
to
make
my
girl
think
rightly
of
me
if
ever
there
s
occasion
i
count
on
you
when
i
m
dead
i
won
t
have
her
think
that
i
was
to
blame
for
her
mother
s
that
s
why
i
ve
told
you
you
believe
me
don
t
you
and
mary
lifting
her
eyes
met
his
look
of
appeal
with
more
than
a

confidence

lionel
tarrant
looked
forth
upon
the
laborious
world
with
a
dainty
enjoyment
of
his
own
limitless
leisure
the
old
gables
fronting
upon
holborn
pleased
his
fancy
he
liked
to
pass
under
the
archway
and
so
at
a
step
estrange
himself
from
commercial
tumult
to
be
in
the
midst
of
modern
life
yet
breathe
an
atmosphere
of
ancient
repose
he
belonged
to
an
informal
club
of
young
men
who
called
themselves
facetiously
the
hodiernals
the
motto
suggested
by
some
one
or
other
after
a
fifth
tumbler
of
whisky
punch
might
bear
more
than
a
single
interpretation
harvey
munden
the
one
member
of
this
genial
brotherhood
who
lived
by
the
sweat
of
his
brow
proposed
as
a
more
suitable
title
les
faineants
that
however
was
judged
pedantic
not
to
say
offensive
for
these
sons
of
the
day
would
not
confess
to
indolence
each
deemed
himself
after
his
own
fashion
a
pioneer
in
art
letters
civilisation
they
had
money
of
their
own
or
were
supported
by
some
one
who
could
afford
that
privilege
most
of
them
had
ostensibly
some
profession
in
view
for
the
present
they
contented
themselves
with
living
and
the
weaker
brethren
read
in
their
hodiernity
an
obligation
to
be
up
to
tarrant
professed
himself
critical
of
apprehensive
of
he
cast
a
backward
eye
none
the
less
his
avowed
principle
was
to
savour
the
passing
hour
when
night
grew
mellow
and
the
god
of
whisky
inspired
his
soul
he
shone
in
a
lyrical
egoism
which
had
but
slight
correspondence
with
the
sincerities
of
his
solitude
his
view
of
woman
the
hodiernals
talked
much
of
woman
differed
considerably
from
his
thoughts
of
the
individual
women
with
whom
he
associated
protesting
oriental
sympathies
he
nourished
in
truth
the
chivalry
appropriate
to
his
years
and
to
his
education
and
imaged
an
ideal
of
female
excellence
whereof
the
prime
features
were
moral
and
intellectual
he
had
no
money
of
his
own
what
could
be
saved
for
him
from
his
father
s
squandered
estate
the
will
established
him
sole
inheritor
went
in
the
costs
of
a
liberal
education
his
grandmother
giving
him
assurance
that
he
should
not
go
forth
into
the
world
penniless
this
promise
tarrant
had
kept
though
not
exactly
in
the
manner
her
grandson
desired
instead
of
making
him
a
fixed
allowance
the
old
lady
supplied
him
with
funds
at
uncertain
intervals
with
the
unpleasant
result
that
it
was
sometimes
necessary
for
him
to
call
to
her
mind
his
dependent
condition
the
cheques
he
received
varied
greatly
in
amount
from
handsome
remittances
of
a
hundred
pounds
or
so
down
to
minim
gifts
which
made
the
young
man
feel
uncomfortable
when
he
received
them
still
he
was
provided
for
and
it
could
not
be
long
before
this
dependency
came
to
an
end
he
believed
in
his
own
abilities
should
it
ever
be
needful
he
could
turn
to
journalism
for
which
undoubtedly
he
had
some
aptitude
but
why
do
anything
at
all
in
the
sense
of
working
for
money
every
year
he
felt
less
disposed
for
that
kind
of
exertion
and
had
a
greater
relish
of
his
leisurely
life
tarrant
never
rebuked
him
indeed
she
had
long
since
ceased
to
make
inquiry
about
his
professional
views
perhaps
she
felt
it
something
of
a
dignity
to
have
a
grandson
who
lived
as
gentleman
at
large
but
now
in
the
latter
days
of
august
the
gentleman
found
himself
in
one
most
important
particular
at
large
no
longer
on
returning
from
teignmouth
to
staple
inn
he
entered
his
rooms
with
a
confused
disagreeable
sense
that
things
were
not
as
they
had
been
that
his
freedom
had
suffered
a
violation
that
he
could
not
sit
down
among
his
books
with
the
old
ease
that
his
prospects
were
completely
indescribably
changed
perchance
much
for
the
worse
in
brief
tarrant
had
gone
forth
a
bachelor
and
came
back
a
married
man
could
it
be
sober
fact
had
he
in
very
deed
committed
so
gross
an
absurdity
he
had
purposed
no
such
thing
miss
nancy
lord
was
not
by
any
means
the
kind
of
person
that
entered
his
thoughts
when
they
turned
to
marriage
he
regarded
her
as
in
every
respect
his
inferior
she
belonged
to
the
social
rank
only
just
above
that
of
her
father
had
a
small
business
in
camberwell
she
dressed
and
talked
rather
above
her
station
but
so
did
every
daughter
of
petty
tradesfolk
from
the
first
he
had
amused
himself
with
her
affectation
of
intellectual
superiority
miss
lord
represented
a
type
to
study
her
as
a
sample
of
the
pretentious
class
was
interesting
this
sort
of
girl
was
turned
out
in
thousands
every
year
from
high
schools
if
they
managed
to
pass
some
examination
or
other
their
conceit
grew
boundless
craftily
he
had
tested
her
knowledge
it
seemed
all
sham
she
would
marry
some
hapless
clerk
and
bring
him
to
bankruptcy
by
the
exigencies
of
her
so
had
he
thought
of
nancy
till
a
few
months
ago
but
in
the
when
his
emotions
blossomed
with
the
blossoming
year
he
met
the
girl
after
a
long
interval
and
saw
her
with
changed
eyes
she
had
something
more
than
prettiness
her
looks
undeniably
improved
it
seemed
too
that
she
bore
herself
more
gracefully
and
even
talked
with
at
times
an
approximation
to
the
speech
of
a
lady
these
admissions
signified
much
in
a
man
of
tarrant
s
social
prejudice
so
strong
that
it
exercised
an
appreciable
effect
upon
his
morals
he
began
to
muse
about
miss
lord
and
the
upshot
of
his
musing
was
that
having
learnt
of
her
departure
for
teignmouth
he
idly
betook
himself
in
the
same
direction
but
as
for
marriage
he
would
as
soon
have
contemplated
taking
to
wife
a
barmaid
between
miss
lord
and
the
young
lady
who
dispenses
refreshment
there
were
distinctions
doubtless
but
none
of
the
first
importance
then
arose
the
question
in
what
spirit
with
what
purpose
did
he
seek
her
intimacy
the
answer
he
simply
postponed
and
postponed
it
very
late
indeed
until
the
choice
was
no
longer
between
making
love
in
idleness
and
conscientiously
holding
aloof
but
between
acting
like
a
frank
blackguard
and
making
the
amends
of
an
honest
man
the
girl
s
fault
to
be
sure
he
had
not
credited
himself
with
this
power
of
fascination
and
certainly
not
with
the
violence
of
passion
which
recklessly
pursues
indulgence
still
the
girl
s
fault
she
had
behaved
well
as
a
girl
of
her
class
might
be
expected
to
behave
ignorance
she
could
not
plead
that
were
preposterous
utter
subjugation
by
first
love
that
perhaps
she
affirmed
it
and
possibly
with
truth
a
flattering
assumption
at
all
events
but
all
said
and
done
the
issue
had
been
of
her
own
seeking
why
then
accuse
himself
of
blackguardly
conduct
if
he
had
turned
a
deaf
ear
to
her
pleading
not
one
word
of
marriage
had
previously
escaped
his
lips
nor
anything
that
could
imply
a
promise
well
there
was
the
awkward
and
unaccountable
fact
that
he
himself
obliged
to
marry
her
that
when
he
seemed
to
be
preparing
resistance
downright
shame
rendered
it
impossible
her
face
her
face
when
she
looked
at
him
and
spoke
the
truth
was
that
he
had
not
hesitated
at
all
there
was
but
one
course
open
to
him
he
gave
glances
in
the
other
direction
he
wished
to
escape
he
reviled
himself
for
his
folly
he
saw
the
difficulties
and
discontents
that
lay
before
him
but
choice
he
had
none
love
in
that
sense
of
the
word
which
tarrant
respected
could
not
be
said
to
influence
him
he
had
uttered
the
word
yes
of
course
he
had
uttered
it
as
a
man
will
who
is
goaded
by
his
raging
blood
but
he
was
as
far
as
ever
from
loving
nancy
lord
her
beauty
and
a
certain
growing
charm
in
her
companionship
had
lured
him
on
his
habitual
idleness
and
the
vagueness
of
his
principles
made
him
guilty
at
last
of
what
a
moralist
would
call
very
deliberate
rascality
he
himself
was
inclined
to
see
his
behaviour
in
that
light
yet
why
had
nancy
so
smoothed
the
path
of
temptation
that
love
was
love
indeed
he
might
take
for
granted
to
a
certain
point
it
excused
her
but
she
seemed
so
thoroughly
able
to
protect
herself
the
time
of
her
green
girlhood
had
so
long
gone
by
for
explanation
he
must
fall
back
again
on
the
circumstances
of
her
origin
and
training
perhaps
she
illustrated
a
social
peril
the
outcome
of
modern
follies
yes
that
was
how
he
would
look
at
it
a
result
of
charlatan
education
operating
upon
crude
character
who
could
say
what
the
girl
had
been
reading
what
cheap
philosophies
had
unsettled
her
mind
is
not
a
little
knowledge
a
dangerous
thing
thus
far
had
he
progressed
in
the
four
and
twenty
hours
which
followed
his
or
nancy
s
conquest
meanwhile
he
had
visited
the
office
of
the
registrar
had
made
his
application
for
a
marriage
licence
a
proceeding
which
did
not
tend
to
soothe
him
later
when
he
saw
nancy
again
he
experienced
a
revival
of
that
humaner
mood
which
accompanied
his
pledge
to
marry
her
the
mood
of
regret
but
also
of
tenderness
of
compassion
a
tenderness
that
did
not
go
very
deep
a
compassion
his
character
and
the
features
of
the
case
at
present
allowed
no
more
but
he
preferred
the
kindlier
attitude
of
course
he
preferred
it
was
he
not
essentially
would
he
not
at
any
ordinary
season
go
out
of
his
way
to
do
a
kindness
did
not
his
soul
revolt
against
every
form
of
injustice
whom
had
he
ever
injured
for
his
humanity
no
less
than
for
his
urbanity
he
claimed
a
noteworthy
distinction
among
young
men
of
the
time
and
there
lay
the
pity
of
it
but
for
nancy
s
he
might
have
come
to
love
her
in
good
earnest
as
it
was
the
growth
of
their
intimacy
had
been
marked
with
singular
unanticipated
impulses
on
his
side
impulses
quite
inconsistent
with
heartless
scheming
in
the
compunctious
visitings
which
interrupted
his
at
least
twice
there
was
more
than
a
revolt
of
mere
honesty
as
he
recognised
during
his
brief
flight
to
london
had
she
exercised
but
the
common
prudence
of
womanhood
why
that
she
did
not
might
tell
both
for
and
against
her
granting
that
she
lacked
true
dignity
native
refinement
might
it
not
have
been
expected
that
artfulness
would
supply
their
place
artful
fencing
would
have
stamped
her
of
coarse
nature
but
coarseness
she
had
never
betrayed
he
had
never
judged
her
worse
than
intellectually
shallow
her
might
then
indicate
a
trait
worthy
of
admiration
her
subsequent
behaviour
undeniably
pleaded
for
respect
she
acquainted
him
with
the
circumstances
of
her
home
life
very
modestly
perhaps
pathetically
he
learnt
that
her
father
was
not
ill
to
do
heard
of
her
domestic
and
social
troubles
that
her
mother
had
been
long
dead
things
weighing
in
her
favour
to
be
sure
if
only
she
had
loved
him
less
it
was
all
over
he
was
married
in
acting
honourably
it
seemed
probable
that
he
had
spoilt
his
life
he
must
be
prepared
for
anything
nancy
said
that
she
should
not
could
not
tell
her
father
yet
awhile
but
that
resolution
was
of
doubtful
stability
for
his
own
part
he
thought
it
clearly
advisable
that
the
fact
should
not
become
known
at
champion
hill
but
could
he
believe
nancy
s
assurance
that
miss
morgan
remained
in
the
dark
upon
one
catastrophe
others
might
naturally
follow
here
saturday
at
noon
came
a
letter
of
nancy
s
writing
a
long
letter
and
by
no
means
a
bad
one
superior
in
fact
to
anything
he
thought
she
could
have
written
it
moved
him
somewhat
but
would
have
moved
him
more
had
he
not
been
legally
bound
to
the
writer
on
sunday
she
could
not
come
to
see
him
but
on
monday
early
in
the
afternoon
well
there
were
consolations
a
wise
man
makes
the
best
of
the
inevitable
chapter
since
his
return
he
had
seen
no
one
and
none
of
his
friends
knew
where
he
had
been
a
call
from
some
stray
hodiernal
would
be
very
unseasonable
this
monday
afternoon
but
probably
they
were
all
enjoying
their
elegant
leisure
in
regions
remote
from
town
as
the
hour
of
nancy
s
arrival
drew
near
he
sat
trying
to
compose
himself
with
indifferent
success
at
one
moment
his
thoughts
found
utterance
and
he
murmured
in
a
strange
bewildered
tone
my
astonishing
words
he
laughed
at
their
effect
upon
him
but
unmirthfully
and
his
next
murmur
was
the
devil
a
mere
ejaculation
betokening
his
state
of
mind
he
reached
several
times
for
his
pipe
and
remembered
when
he
had
touched
it
that
the
lips
with
which
he
greeted
nancy
ought
not
to
be
redolent
of
tobacco
in
outward
respect
at
all
events
he
would
not
fall
short
just
when
his
nervousness
was
becoming
intolerable
there
sounded
a
knock
the
knock
he
had
anticipated
timid
brief
he
stepped
hastily
from
the
room
and
opened
nancy
hardly
looked
at
him
and
neither
of
them
spoke
till
the
closing
of
two
doors
had
assured
their
privacy
well
you
had
no
difficulty
in
finding
the
place
no
none
at
they
stood
apart
and
spoke
with
constraint
nancy
s
bosom
heaved
as
though
she
had
been
hastening
overmuch
her
face
was
deeply
coloured
her
eyes
had
an
unwonted
appearance
resembling
those
of
a
at
weary
dawn
she
cast
quick
glances
about
the
room
but
with
the
diffidence
of
an
intruder
her
attitude
was
marked
by
the
same
characteristic
she
seemed
to
shrink
to
be
ashamed
come
and
sit
down
said
tarrant
cheerfully
as
he
wheeled
a
chair
she
obeyed
him
and
he
stooping
beside
her
offered
his
lips
nancy
kissed
him
closing
her
eyes
for
the
moment
then
dropping
them
again
it
seems
a
long
time
nancy
doesn
t
it
yes
a
very
long
you
couldn
t
come
on
sunday
i
found
my
father
very
ill
i
didn
t
like
to
leave
home
till
your
father
ill
you
said
nothing
of
it
in
your
no
i
didn
t
like
to
with
the
other
a
singular
delicacy
this
tarrant
understood
it
and
looked
at
her
thoughtfully
again
she
was
examining
the
room
with
hurried
glance
upon
him
her
eyes
did
not
turn
he
asked
questions
about
lord
nancy
could
not
explain
the
nature
of
his
illness
he
had
spoken
of
gout
but
she
feared
it
must
be
something
worse
the
change
in
him
since
she
went
away
was
incredible
and
most
alarming
this
she
said
in
short
quick
sentences
her
voice
low
tarrant
thought
to
himself
that
in
her
too
a
very
short
time
had
made
a
very
notable
change
he
tried
to
read
its
significance
but
could
reach
no
certainty
i
m
sorry
to
hear
all
this
very
sorry
you
must
tell
me
more
about
your
father
take
off
your
hat
dear
and
your
her
gloves
she
removed
first
and
laid
them
on
her
lap
tarrant
took
them
away
then
her
hat
this
too
he
placed
on
the
table
having
done
so
he
softly
touched
the
plaits
of
her
hair
and
for
the
first
time
nancy
looked
up
at
him
are
you
glad
to
see
me
she
asked
in
a
voice
that
seemed
subdued
by
doubt
of
the
answer
i
am
very
his
hand
fell
to
her
shoulder
with
a
quick
movement
a
stifled
exclamation
the
girl
rose
and
flung
her
arms
about
him
are
you
really
glad
do
you
really
love
me
never
doubt
it
dear
ah
but
i
can
t
help
i
have
hardly
slept
at
night
in
trying
to
get
rid
of
the
doubt
when
you
opened
the
door
i
felt
you
didn
t
welcome
me
don
t
you
think
of
me
as
a
burden
i
can
t
help
wondering
why
i
am
he
took
hold
of
her
left
hand
and
looked
at
it
then
said
playfully
of
course
you
wonder
what
business
has
a
wife
to
come
and
see
her
husband
without
the
ring
on
her
finger
nancy
turned
from
him
opened
the
front
of
her
dress
unknotted
a
string
of
silk
and
showed
her
finger
bright
with
the
golden
circlet
that
s
how
i
must
wear
it
except
when
i
am
with
you
i
keep
touching
to
make
sure
it
s
tarrant
kissed
her
fingers
dear
she
had
her
face
against
him
make
me
certain
that
you
love
me
speak
to
me
like
you
did
before
oh
i
never
knew
in
my
life
what
it
was
to
feel
ashamed
ashamed
because
you
are
married
nancy
am
i
really
married
that
seems
impossible
it
s
like
having
dreamt
that
i
was
married
to
you
i
can
hardly
remember
a
thing
that
the
registry
at
teignmouth
remembers
he
answered
with
a
laugh
those
books
have
a
long
she
raised
her
eyes
but
wouldn
t
you
undo
it
if
you
could
no
no
i
don
t
mean
that
only
that
if
it
had
never
happened
if
we
had
said
before
those
last
days
wouldn
t
you
have
been
glad
now
why
that
s
a
difficult
question
to
answer
he
returned
gently
it
all
depends
on
your
own
for
whatever
reason
these
words
so
overcame
nancy
that
she
burst
into
tears
tarrant
at
once
more
soothed
and
fondled
her
and
drew
her
to
sit
on
his
knee
you
re
not
like
your
old
self
dear
girl
of
course
i
can
understand
it
and
your
father
s
illness
but
you
mustn
t
think
of
it
in
this
way
i
do
love
you
nancy
i
couldn
t
unsay
a
word
i
said
to
you
i
don
t
wish
anything
make
me
believe
that
i
think
i
should
be
quite
happy
then
it
s
the
hateful
thought
that
perhaps
you
never
wanted
me
for
your
wife
it
come
again
and
again
and
it
makes
me
feel
as
if
i
would
rather
have
send
such
thoughts
packing
tell
them
your
husband
wants
all
your
heart
and
mind
for
but
will
you
never
think
ill
of
me
she
whispered
the
words
i
should
be
a
contemptible
sort
of
no
i
ought
to
have
if
we
had
spoken
of
our
love
to
each
other
and
a
very
proper
twelvemonth
s
engagement
meetings
at
five
o
clock
tea
fifty
thousand
and
all
that
kind
of
thing
oh
we
chose
a
better
way
our
wedding
was
among
the
leaves
and
flowers
you
remember
the
glow
of
evening
sunlight
between
the
red
pine
and
the
silver
birch
i
hope
that
place
may
remain
as
it
is
all
our
lives
we
will
go
there
never
never
ask
me
to
go
there
i
want
to
forget
i
hope
some
day
i
may
if
you
hope
so
then
i
will
hope
the
and
you
love
me
with
real
husband
s
love
love
that
will
last
why
should
answer
all
the
questions
he
took
her
face
between
his
hands
what
if
the
wife
s
love
should
fail
first
you
can
say
that
lightly
because
you
know
what
do
i
know
you
know
that
i
am
love
of
you
as
long
as
i
am
myself
i
must
love
you
it
was
because
i
had
no
will
of
my
own
left
because
i
lived
only
in
the
thought
of
you
day
and
night
their
lips
met
in
a
long
silence
i
mustn
t
stay
past
four
o
clock
were
nancy
s
next
words
i
don
t
like
to
be
away
long
from
the
house
father
won
t
ask
me
anything
but
he
knows
i
m
away
somewhere
and
i
m
afraid
it
makes
him
angry
with
she
examined
the
room
how
comfortable
you
are
here
what
a
delightful
old
place
to
live
in
will
you
look
at
the
other
rooms
not
when
i
come
again
i
must
say
very
soon
oh
see
how
the
time
goes
what
a
large
library
you
have
you
must
let
me
look
at
all
the
books
when
i
have
let
you
they
are
yours
as
much
as
her
face
brightened
i
should
like
to
live
here
how
i
should
enjoy
it
after
that
hateful
grove
lane
shall
i
live
here
with
you
some
day
there
wouldn
t
be
room
for
two
why
your
dresses
would
fill
the
whole
she
went
and
stood
before
the
shelves
but
how
dusty
you
are
who
cleans
for
you
no
one
a
very
rickety
old
woman
draws
a
certain
number
of
shillings
each
week
on
pretence
of
what
a
shame
she
neglects
you
disgracefully
you
shall
go
away
some
afternoon
and
leave
me
here
with
a
great
pile
of
you
can
do
that
kind
of
thing
it
never
occurred
to
me
to
ask
you
are
you
a
domestic
person
she
answered
with
something
of
the
old
confident
air
that
was
an
oversight
wasn
t
it
after
all
how
little
you
know
about
me
do
you
know
much
more
of
me
her
countenance
fell
you
are
going
to
tell
me
everything
how
long
have
you
lived
here
two
years
and
a
and
your
friends
come
to
see
you
here
of
course
they
do
i
meant
have
you
many
friends
friends
no
a
good
many
men
like
yourself
mostly
men
fellows
who
talk
about
art
and
and
women
nancy
faltered
half
turning
away
oh
magnificent
creatures
greek
scholars
mathematicians
all
that
is
most
advanced
that
s
the
right
answer
to
a
silly
question
said
nancy
humbly
whereat
tarrant
fixed
his
gaze
upon
her
i
begin
to
think
that
he
checked
himself
awkwardly
nancy
insisted
on
the
completion
of
his
thought
that
of
all
the
women
i
know
you
have
the
most
i
had
rather
hear
you
say
that
than
have
a
great
she
blushed
with
joy
perhaps
you
will
love
me
some
day
as
i
wish
to
be
how
i
ll
tell
you
another
time
if
it
weren
t
for
my
father
s
illness
i
think
i
could
go
home
feeling
almost
happy
but
how
am
i
to
know
what
you
are
doing
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
just
tell
me
how
you
live
what
shall
you
do
now
when
i
m
gone
sit
disconsolate
he
came
nearer
thinking
you
were
just
a
little
no
don
t
say
nancy
was
flurried
i
have
told
you
the
real
reason
our
housekeeper
says
that
father
was
disappointed
and
angry
because
i
put
off
my
return
from
teignmouth
he
spoke
to
me
very
coldly
and
i
have
hardly
seen
him
since
he
won
t
let
me
wait
upon
him
and
i
have
thought
since
i
know
how
ill
he
really
is
that
i
must
seem
heartless
i
will
come
for
longer
next
to
make
amends
for
the
reproach
he
had
uttered
in
spite
of
himself
tarrant
began
to
relate
in
full
the
events
of
his
ordinary
day
i
get
my
own
breakfast
the
only
meal
i
have
at
home
look
here
s
the
kitchen
queer
old
place
and
here
s
the
cupboards
everywhere
you
see
we
boast
of
our
cupboards
the
green
paint
is
duck
s
egg
colour
i
ve
got
to
like
it
that
door
leads
into
the
bedroom
well
after
breakfast
about
eleven
o
clock
that
s
to
say
i
light
up
look
at
my
and
read
newspapers
then
if
it
s
fine
i
walk
about
the
streets
and
see
what
new
follies
men
are
perpetrating
and
then
he
told
of
his
favourite
restaurants
of
his
unfashionable
club
of
a
few
houses
where
at
long
intervals
he
called
or
dined
of
the
hodiernals
of
a
dozen
other
small
matters
what
a
life
sighed
the
listener
compared
with
mine
we
ll
remedy
that
some
when
she
asked
absently
wait
just
a
you
don
t
wish
to
tell
your
father
i
daren
t
tell
him
i
doubt
whether
i
shall
ever
dare
to
tell
him
face
to
don
t
think
about
it
leave
it
to
i
must
have
letters
from
you
but
how
perhaps
if
you
could
promise
always
to
send
them
for
the
first
post
i
generally
go
to
the
and
i
could
do
so
always
whilst
father
is
this
was
agreed
upon
nancy
whilst
they
were
talking
took
her
hat
from
the
table
at
the
same
moment
tarrant
s
hand
moved
towards
it
their
eyes
met
and
the
hand
that
would
have
checked
her
was
drawn
back
quickly
secretly
she
drew
the
ring
from
her
finger
hid
it
somewhere
and
took
her
gloves
did
you
come
by
the
back
way
tarrant
asked
when
he
had
bitten
his
lips
for
a
sulky
minute
yes
as
you
told
he
said
he
would
walk
with
her
into
chancery
lane
there
could
be
no
risk
in
it
you
shall
go
out
first
any
one
passing
will
suppose
you
had
business
with
the
solicitor
underneath
i
ll
overtake
you
at
southampton
impatient
to
be
gone
she
lingered
minute
after
minute
and
broke
hurriedly
from
his
restraining
arms
at
last
the
second
outer
door
which
tarrant
had
closed
on
her
entrance
surprised
her
by
its
massiveness
in
the
wooden
staircase
she
stopped
timidly
but
at
the
exit
her
eyes
turned
to
an
inscription
above
which
she
had
just
glanced
at
when
arriving
e
and
a
date
nancy
had
no
latin
but
guessed
an
interpretation
from
the
last
word
through
the
little
court
with
its
leafy
and
she
walked
with
bent
head
hearing
the
roar
of
holborn
through
the
front
archway
and
breathing
more
freely
when
she
gained
the
quiet
garden
at
the
back
of
the
inn
tarrant
s
step
sounded
behind
her
looking
up
she
asked
the
meaning
of
the
inscription
she
had
seen
you
don
t
know
latin
well
why
should
you
e
it
rose
again
from
the
i
thought
it
might
be
something
like
that
you
will
be
patient
with
my
ignorance
a
strange
word
upon
nancy
s
lips
no
mortal
ere
this
had
heard
her
confess
to
ignorance
but
you
know
the
modern
languages
said
tarrant
smiling
yes
that
is
a
little
french
and
german
a
very
little
tarrant
mused
seemingly
with
no
dissatisfaction
chapter
in
her
brother
s
looks
and
speech
nancy
detected
something
mysterious
undoubtedly
he
was
keeping
a
secret
from
her
and
there
could
be
just
as
little
doubt
that
he
would
not
keep
it
long
whenever
she
questioned
him
about
the
holiday
at
scarborough
he
put
on
a
smile
unlike
any
she
had
ever
seen
on
his
face
so
profoundly
thoughtful
was
it
so
loftily
reserved
on
the
subject
of
damerel
he
did
not
choose
to
be
very
communicative
nancy
gathered
little
more
than
she
had
learnt
from
his
letter
but
very
plainly
the
young
man
held
himself
in
higher
esteem
than
hitherto
very
plainly
he
had
learnt
to
think
of
the
office
as
a
burden
or
degradation
from
which
he
would
soon
escape
prompted
by
her
own
tormenting
conscience
his
sister
wondered
whether
fanny
french
had
anything
to
do
with
the
mystery
but
this
seemed
improbable
she
mentioned
fanny
s
name
one
evening
do
you
see
much
of
her
not
much
was
the
dreamy
reply
when
are
you
going
to
call
oh
not
at
present
said
nancy
you
ve
altered
again
then
she
vouchsafed
no
answer
there
s
something
i
think
i
ought
to
tell
you
said
horace
speaking
as
though
he
were
the
elder
and
felt
a
responsibility
people
have
been
talking
about
you
and
what
she
flashed
into
excessive
anger
who
has
been
talking
the
people
over
there
of
course
i
know
it
s
all
nonsense
at
least
he
raised
his
eyebrows
i
suppose
it
should
suppose
so
said
nancy
with
vehement
scorn
their
father
s
illness
imposed
a
restraint
upon
trifling
conversation
mary
woodruff
now
attending
upon
lord
under
the
doctor
s
directions
had
held
grave
talk
with
nancy
the
barmbys
father
and
son
called
frequently
and
went
away
with
gloomy
faces
nancy
and
her
brother
were
summoned
separately
to
the
invalid
s
room
at
uncertain
times
but
neither
was
allowed
to
perform
any
service
for
him
their
sympathy
more
often
than
not
excited
irritation
the
sufferer
always
seemed
desirous
of
saying
more
than
the
few
and
insignificant
words
which
actually
passed
his
lips
and
generally
after
a
long
silence
he
gave
the
young
people
an
abrupt
dismissal
with
his
daughter
he
spoke
at
length
in
language
which
awed
her
by
its
solemnity
nancy
could
only
understand
him
as
meaning
that
his
end
drew
near
he
had
been
reviewing
he
said
the
course
of
her
life
and
trying
to
forecast
her
future
i
give
you
no
more
advice
it
would
only
be
repeating
what
i
have
said
hundreds
of
times
all
i
can
for
your
good
i
have
done
you
will
understand
me
better
if
you
live
a
few
more
years
and
i
think
in
the
end
you
will
be
grateful
to
nancy
sitting
by
the
bedside
laid
a
hand
upon
her
father
s
and
sobbed
she
entreated
him
to
believe
that
even
now
she
understood
how
wisely
he
had
guided
her
tried
to
nancy
tried
to
my
dear
guidance
isn
t
for
young
people
don
t
let
us
shirk
the
truth
i
have
never
been
satisfied
with
you
but
i
have
loved
you
and
i
you
dear
father
i
have
i
have
i
know
better
now
how
good
your
advice
was
i
wish
far
far
more
sincerely
than
you
think
that
i
had
kept
more
control
upon
myself
thought
less
of
myself
in
every
way
whilst
she
spoke
through
her
tears
the
yellow
wrinkled
face
upon
the
pillow
with
its
sunken
eyes
and
wasted
lips
kept
sternly
motionless
if
you
won
t
mock
at
me
stephen
pursued
i
will
show
you
an
example
you
would
do
well
to
imitate
it
is
our
old
servant
now
my
kindest
truest
friend
if
i
could
hope
that
you
will
let
her
be
friend
it
would
help
to
put
my
mind
at
rest
don
t
look
down
upon
her
that
s
such
a
poor
way
of
thinking
of
all
the
women
i
have
known
she
is
the
best
don
t
be
too
proud
to
learn
from
her
nancy
in
all
these
twenty
years
that
she
has
been
in
my
house
whatever
she
undertook
to
do
she
did
well
nothing
too
hard
or
too
humble
for
her
if
she
thought
it
her
duty
i
know
what
that
means
i
myself
have
been
a
poor
weak
creature
compared
with
her
don
t
be
offended
because
i
ask
you
to
take
pattern
by
her
i
know
her
value
now
better
than
i
ever
knew
it
before
i
owe
her
a
debt
i
can
t
nancy
left
the
room
burdened
with
strange
and
distressful
thoughts
when
she
saw
mary
she
looked
at
her
with
new
feelings
and
spoke
to
her
less
familiarly
than
of
wont
mary
was
very
silent
in
these
days
her
face
had
the
dignity
of
a
profound
unspoken
grief
to
his
son
lord
talked
only
of
practical
things
urging
sound
advice
and
refraining
now
from
any
mention
of
their
differences
horace
absorbed
in
preoccupations
had
never
dreamt
that
this
illness
might
prove
fatal
on
finding
nancy
in
tears
he
was
astonished
do
you
think
it
s
dangerous
he
asked
i
m
afraid
he
will
never
get
it
was
sunday
morning
the
young
man
went
apart
and
pondered
after
the
meal
having
heard
from
mary
that
his
father
was
no
worse
he
left
home
without
remark
to
any
one
and
from
camberwell
green
took
a
cab
to
trafalgar
square
at
the
hotel
metropole
he
inquired
for
damerel
her
rooms
were
high
up
and
he
ascended
by
the
lift
sunk
in
a
deep
chair
her
feet
extended
upon
a
hassock
damerel
was
amusing
herself
with
a
comic
paper
she
rose
briskly
though
with
the
effort
of
a
person
who
is
no
longer
slim
here
i
am
you
see
up
in
the
clouds
now
you
get
my
letter
no
letter
but
a
there
i
thought
so
isn
t
that
just
like
me
as
soon
as
i
had
sent
out
the
letter
to
post
i
said
to
myself
that
i
had
written
the
wrong
address
what
address
it
i
couldn
t
tell
you
to
save
my
life
but
i
shall
see
when
it
comes
back
from
the
i
rather
suspect
it
s
gone
to
gunnersbury
just
then
i
was
thinking
about
somebody
at
gunnersbury
or
somebody
at
hampstead
i
can
t
be
sure
which
what
a
good
thing
i
wired
oh
now
horace
i
like
that
i
don
t
really
the
young
man
looked
at
her
in
bewilderment
what
don
t
you
like
why
that
tie
it
won
t
do
at
all
your
taste
is
generally
very
good
but
that
tie
i
ll
choose
one
for
you
and
let
you
have
it
the
next
time
you
come
do
you
know
i
ve
been
thinking
that
it
might
be
well
if
you
parted
your
hair
in
the
middle
i
don
t
care
for
it
as
a
rule
but
in
your
case
with
your
soft
beautiful
hair
i
think
it
would
look
well
shall
we
try
wait
a
minute
i
ll
run
for
a
but
suppose
some
one
came
nobody
will
come
my
dear
boy
hardly
any
one
knows
i
m
here
i
like
to
get
away
from
people
now
and
then
that
s
why
i
ve
taken
refuge
in
this
she
disappeared
and
came
back
with
a
comb
of
sit
down
there
oh
what
hair
it
is
to
be
sure
almost
as
fine
as
my
own
i
think
you
ll
have
a
delicious
her
personal
appearance
was
quite
in
keeping
with
this
vivacity
rather
short
and
inclining
but
as
yet
only
inclining
to
rotundity
of
figure
with
a
peculiarly
soft
and
clear
complexion
damerel
made
a
gallant
battle
against
the
hostile
years
her
bright
eye
her
moist
lips
the
admirable
smoothness
of
brow
and
cheek
and
throat
bore
witness
to
sound
health
as
did
the
rows
of
teeth
incontestably
her
own
which
she
exhibited
in
her
frequent
mirth
a
handsome
woman
still
though
not
of
the
type
that
commands
a
reverent
admiration
her
frivolity
did
not
exclude
a
suggestion
of
shrewdness
nor
yet
of
capacity
for
emotion
but
it
was
difficult
to
imagine
wise
or
elevated
thought
behind
that
narrow
brow
she
was
elaborately
dressed
with
only
the
most
fashionable
symbols
of
widowhood
rings
adorned
her
podgy
little
hand
and
a
bracelet
her
white
wrist
refinement
she
possessed
only
in
the
sense
but
her
intonation
was
that
of
the
idle
class
and
her
grammar
did
not
limp
there
let
me
look
oh
i
think
that
s
an
improvement
more
and
now
tell
me
the
news
how
is
your
father
very
bad
i
m
afraid
said
horace
when
he
had
regarded
himself
in
a
mirror
with
something
of
doubtfulness
nancy
says
that
she
s
afraid
he
won
t
get
oh
you
don
t
say
that
oh
how
very
sad
but
let
us
hope
i
can
t
think
it
s
so
bad
as
horace
sat
in
thought
damerel
her
bright
eyes
subduing
their
gaiety
to
a
keen
reflectiveness
put
several
questions
regarding
the
invalid
then
for
a
moment
meditated
well
we
must
hope
for
the
best
let
me
know
how
he
gets
on
be
sure
you
let
me
know
and
if
anything
happen
oh
but
that
s
too
sad
we
won
t
talk
about
again
she
meditated
tapping
the
floor
and
as
it
seemed
trying
not
to
smile
don
t
be
downcast
my
dear
boy
never
meet
sorrow
if
you
knew
how
useful
i
have
found
it
to
remember
that
maxim
i
have
gone
through
sad
sad
things
ah
but
now
tell
me
of
your
own
affairs
have
you
seen
i
just
saw
her
the
other
evening
he
answered
uneasily
just
what
does
that
mean
i
wonder
now
you
don
t
look
anything
like
so
well
as
when
you
were
at
scarborough
you
re
worrying
yes
i
know
you
are
it
s
your
nervous
constitution
my
poor
boy
so
you
just
saw
her
no
more
imprudences
she
examined
his
face
attentively
her
lips
set
with
tolerable
firmness
it
s
a
very
difficult
position
you
know
said
horace
wriggling
in
his
chair
i
can
t
get
out
of
it
all
at
once
and
the
truth
is
i
m
not
sure
that
i
wish
damerel
drew
her
eyebrows
together
and
gave
a
loud
tap
on
the
floor
oh
that
s
weak
that
s
very
weak
after
promising
me
now
listen
listen
she
raised
a
finger
if
it
goes
on
i
have
nothing
more
whatever
to
do
with
you
it
would
distress
me
very
very
much
but
i
can
t
interest
myself
in
a
young
man
who
makes
love
to
a
girl
so
very
far
beneath
him
be
led
by
me
horace
and
your
future
will
be
brilliant
prefer
this
young
lady
of
camberwell
and
lose
horace
leaned
forward
and
drooped
his
head
i
don
t
think
you
form
anything
like
a
right
idea
of
her
he
said
the
other
moved
impatiently
my
dear
boy
i
know
her
as
well
as
if
i
d
lived
with
her
for
years
oh
how
silly
you
are
but
then
you
are
so
young
so
very
with
the
vexation
on
her
face
there
blended
as
she
looked
at
him
a
tenderness
unmistakably
genuine
now
i
ll
tell
you
what
i
have
really
no
objection
to
make
fanny
s
acquaintance
suppose
after
all
you
bring
her
to
see
me
one
of
these
days
not
just
yet
you
must
wait
till
i
am
in
the
mood
for
it
but
before
very
horace
looked
up
with
pleasure
and
gratitude
now
that
s
really
kind
of
you
really
and
all
the
rest
is
only
pretended
kindness
silly
boy
some
day
you
will
know
better
now
think
horace
suppose
you
were
so
unhappy
as
to
lose
your
father
could
you
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
do
something
that
you
know
would
have
pained
him
deeply
the
pathetic
note
was
a
little
strained
putting
her
head
aside
damerel
looked
rather
like
a
sentimental
picture
in
an
advertisement
horace
did
not
reply
you
surely
wouldn
t
pursued
the
lady
with
emphasis
watching
him
closely
you
surely
wouldn
t
and
couldn
t
marry
this
girl
as
soon
as
your
poor
father
was
in
his
grave
oh
of
course
damerel
seemed
relieved
but
pursued
her
questioning
you
couldn
t
think
of
marrying
for
at
least
half
a
year
fanny
wouldn
t
wish
no
of
course
not
well
now
i
think
i
must
make
her
acquaintance
but
how
weak
you
are
horace
oh
those
nerves
all
finely
delicately
organised
people
like
you
make
such
blunders
in
life
your
sense
of
honour
is
such
a
tyrant
over
you
now
mind
i
don
t
say
for
a
moment
that
fanny
isn
t
fond
of
you
how
could
she
help
being
my
dear
boy
but
i
do
insist
that
she
will
be
very
much
happier
if
you
let
her
marry
some
one
of
her
own
class
you
horace
belong
to
a
social
sphere
so
far
far
above
her
if
i
could
only
impress
that
upon
your
modesty
you
are
made
to
associate
with
people
of
the
highest
refinement
how
deplorable
to
think
that
a
place
in
society
is
waiting
for
you
and
you
keep
longing
for
camberwell
the
listener
s
face
wavered
between
pleasure
in
such
flattery
and
the
impulse
of
resistance
remember
horace
if
anything
happen
at
home
you
are
your
own
master
i
could
introduce
you
freely
to
people
of
wealth
and
fashion
of
course
you
could
give
up
the
office
at
once
i
shall
be
taking
a
house
in
the
or
a
flat
at
all
events
i
shall
entertain
a
good
deal
and
think
of
your
opportunities
my
dear
boy
i
assure
you
that
with
personal
advantages
such
as
yours
you
might
end
by
marrying
an
heiress
nothing
more
probable
and
you
can
talk
of
such
a
girl
as
fanny
french
for
shame
i
mustn
t
propose
any
gaieties
just
now
she
said
when
they
had
been
together
for
an
hour
and
i
shall
wait
so
anxiously
for
news
of
your
father
if
anything
happen
what
would
your
sister
do
i
wonder
i
m
sure
i
don
t
know
except
that
she
d
get
away
from
camberwell
nancy
hates
who
knows
i
may
be
able
to
be
of
use
to
her
but
you
say
she
is
such
a
grave
and
learned
young
lady
i
am
afraid
we
should
bore
each
to
this
horace
could
venture
only
an
uncertain
reply
he
had
not
much
hope
of
mutual
understanding
between
his
sister
and
damerel
at
five
he
was
home
again
and
there
followed
a
cheerless
evening
nancy
was
in
her
own
room
until
nine
o
clock
she
came
down
for
supper
but
had
no
appetite
her
eyes
showed
redness
from
weeping
horace
could
say
nothing
for
her
comfort
after
the
meal
they
went
up
together
to
the
and
sat
unoccupied
if
we
lose
father
said
nancy
in
a
dull
voice
very
unlike
her
ordinary
tones
we
shall
have
not
a
single
relative
left
that
is
anything
to
her
brother
kept
silence
has
damerel
she
continued
ever
said
anything
to
you
about
mother
s
family
after
hesitation
horace
answered
yes
and
his
countenance
showed
that
the
affirmative
had
special
meaning
nancy
waited
with
an
inquiring
look
i
haven
t
told
you
he
added
because
we
have
had
other
things
to
think
about
but
damerel
is
mother
s
sister
our
how
long
have
you
known
that
she
told
me
at
but
why
didn
t
she
tell
you
so
at
first
that
s
what
i
can
t
understand
she
says
she
was
afraid
i
might
mention
it
but
i
don
t
believe
that
s
the
real
nancy
s
questioning
elicited
all
that
was
to
be
learnt
from
her
brother
little
more
than
she
had
heard
already
the
same
story
of
a
disagreement
between
damerel
and
their
father
of
long
absences
from
england
and
a
revival
of
interest
in
her
relatives
following
upon
damerel
s
widowhood
she
would
be
glad
to
see
you
if
you
liked
but
i
doubt
whether
you
would
get
on
very
why
she
doesn
t
care
about
the
same
things
that
you
do
she
s
a
woman
of
society
you
but
if
she
s
mother
s
sister
yes
i
should
like
to
know
nancy
spoke
with
increasing
earnestness
it
makes
everything
quite
different
i
must
see
well
as
i
said
she
s
quite
willing
but
you
remember
that
i
m
supposed
not
to
have
spoken
about
her
at
all
i
should
have
to
get
her
to
send
you
a
message
or
something
of
that
kind
of
course
we
have
often
talked
about
i
can
t
form
an
idea
of
her
said
nancy
impatiently
is
she
good
is
she
really
kind
couldn
t
you
get
her
portrait
to
show
me
i
should
be
afraid
to
ask
unless
she
had
given
me
leave
to
speak
to
she
really
lives
in
good
society
haven
t
i
told
you
the
sort
of
people
she
knows
she
must
be
very
well
off
there
can
t
be
a
doubt
of
i
don
t
care
so
much
about
that
said
nancy
in
a
brooding
voice
it
s
herself
whether
she
s
kind
and
good
and
wishes
well
to
us
the
next
day
there
was
no
change
in
lord
s
condition
a
deep
silence
possessed
the
house
in
the
afternoon
nancy
went
to
pass
an
hour
with
jessica
morgan
on
her
return
she
met
samuel
barmby
who
was
just
leaving
after
a
visit
to
the
sick
man
samuel
bore
himself
with
portentous
gravity
but
spoke
only
a
few
commonplaces
affecting
hope
he
bestowed
upon
nancy
s
hand
a
fervent
pressure
and
strode
away
with
the
air
of
an
undertaker
who
had
called
on
business
two
more
days
of
deepening
gloom
then
a
night
through
which
nancy
sat
with
mary
woodruff
by
her
father
s
bed
lord
was
unconscious
but
from
time
to
time
a
syllable
or
a
phrase
fell
from
his
lips
meaningless
to
the
watchers
at
dawn
nancy
went
to
her
chamber
pallid
exhausted
mary
whose
strength
seemed
proof
against
fatigue
moved
about
the
room
preparing
for
a
new
day
every
few
minutes
she
stood
with
eyes
fixed
on
the
dying
face
and
the
tears
she
had
restrained
in
nancy
s
presence
flowed
silently
when
the
sun
made
a
golden
glimmer
upon
the
wall
mary
withdrew
and
was
absent
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
on
returning
she
bent
at
once
over
the
bed
her
eyes
were
met
by
a
grave
wondering
look
do
you
know
me
she
whispered
the
lips
moved
she
bent
lower
but
could
distinguish
no
word
he
was
speaking
the
murmur
continued
but
she
gathered
no
sense
you
can
trust
me
i
will
do
all
i
he
seemed
to
understand
her
and
smiled
as
the
smile
faded
away
passing
into
an
austere
calm
mary
pressed
her
lips
upon
his
forehead
chapter
after
breakfast
and
before
arthur
peachey
s
departure
for
business
there
had
been
a
scene
of
violent
quarrel
between
him
and
his
wife
it
took
place
in
the
where
as
usual
save
on
sunday
morning
ada
consumed
her
strong
tea
and
heavily
buttered
toast
the
state
of
her
health
she
had
frequent
ailments
more
or
less
genuine
such
as
afflict
the
indolent
and
brainless
type
of
woman
made
it
necessary
for
her
to
repose
till
a
late
hour
peachey
did
not
often
lose
though
sorely
tried
the
one
occasion
that
unchained
his
wrath
was
when
ada
s
heedlessness
or
affected
the
of
his
child
this
morning
it
had
been
announced
to
him
that
the
emma
could
no
longer
be
tolerated
she
was
making
herself
offensive
to
her
mistress
had
spoken
insolently
disobeyed
orders
and
worst
of
all
defended
herself
by
alleging
orders
from
peachey
hence
the
outbreak
of
strife
signalled
by
furious
shrill
voices
audible
to
beatrice
and
fanny
as
they
sat
in
the
room
beneath
ada
came
down
at
ten
and
found
beatrice
writing
letters
she
announced
what
any
who
did
not
know
her
would
have
taken
for
a
final
resolve
i
m
going
i
won
t
put
up
with
that
beast
any
longer
i
shall
go
and
live
at
her
sister
paid
not
the
slightest
heed
she
was
intent
upon
a
business
letter
of
much
moment
do
you
hear
what
i
say
i
m
going
by
the
first
train
this
all
right
remarked
beatrice
placidly
don
t
interrupt
me
just
now
the
result
of
this
was
fury
directed
against
beatrice
who
found
herself
accused
of
every
domestic
vice
compatible
with
her
position
she
was
a
sordid
creature
living
at
other
people
s
expense
a
selfish
scheming
envious
wretch
if
i
were
your
husband
remarked
the
other
without
looking
up
i
should
long
since
have
turned
you
into
the
street
if
i
hadn
t
broken
your
neck
exercise
in
quarrel
only
made
ada
s
voice
the
clearer
and
more
shrill
it
rose
now
to
the
highest
points
of
a
not
inconsiderable
compass
but
beatrice
continued
to
write
and
by
resolute
silence
put
a
limit
to
her
sister
s
railing
a
pause
had
just
come
about
when
the
door
was
thrown
open
and
in
rushed
fanny
hatted
and
gloved
from
a
walk
he
s
dead
she
said
excitedly
he
s
dead
beatrice
turned
with
a
look
of
interest
who
lord
yes
the
blinds
are
all
down
he
must
have
died
in
the
her
cheeks
glowed
and
her
eyes
sparkled
as
though
she
had
brought
the
most
exhilarating
news
what
do
i
care
said
peachey
to
whom
her
sister
had
addressed
the
last
remark
just
as
much
as
i
care
about
your
affairs
no
doubt
returned
fanny
with
genial
frankness
don
t
be
in
too
great
a
hurry
remarked
beatrice
who
showed
the
calculating
wrinkle
at
the
corner
of
her
eye
because
he
s
dead
that
doesn
t
say
that
your
masher
comes
in
for
who
ll
get
it
then
there
may
be
nothing
worth
speaking
of
to
get
for
all
we
beatrice
had
not
as
yet
gained
fanny
s
in
the
commercial
scheme
now
being
elaborated
though
of
far
more
amiable
nature
than
peachey
she
heartily
hoped
that
the
girl
might
be
disappointed
in
her
expectations
from
lord
s
will
an
hour
later
she
walked
along
grove
lane
and
saw
for
herself
that
fanny
s
announcement
was
accurate
the
blinds
could
mean
but
one
thing
there
was
little
likelihood
of
learning
particulars
but
on
the
morrow
fanny
might
perchance
hear
something
from
horace
lord
however
the
evening
brought
a
note
by
some
stranger
horace
wrote
only
a
line
or
two
informing
fanny
that
his
father
had
died
about
eight
o
clock
that
morning
and
adding
please
be
at
home
at
at
twelve
next
day
fanny
received
her
lover
alone
in
the
he
entered
with
the
exaggerated
solemnity
of
a
very
young
man
who
knows
for
the
first
time
a
grave
bereavement
and
feels
the
momentary
importance
it
confers
upon
him
fanny
trying
to
regard
him
without
a
smile
grimaced
decorous
behaviour
was
at
all
times
impossible
to
her
for
she
neither
understood
its
nature
nor
felt
its
obligation
in
a
few
minutes
she
smiled
unrestrainedly
and
spoke
the
things
that
rose
to
her
lips
i
ve
been
keeping
a
secret
from
you
said
horace
in
the
low
voice
which
had
to
express
his
sorrow
for
he
could
not
preserve
a
gloomy
countenance
with
fanny
before
him
but
i
can
tell
you
a
secret
and
what
business
had
you
to
keep
secrets
from
me
it
s
about
damerel
when
i
was
at
the
seaside
she
told
me
who
she
really
is
she
s
my
aunt
my
mother
s
sister
queer
isn
t
it
of
course
that
makes
everything
different
and
she
s
going
to
ask
you
to
come
and
see
her
it
ll
have
to
be
put
off
a
little
now
but
not
very
long
i
dare
say
as
she
s
a
relative
you
ll
have
to
do
your
best
to
please
i
m
sure
i
shan
t
put
myself
out
of
the
way
people
must
take
me
as
they
find
now
don
t
talk
like
that
fanny
it
isn
t
very
kind
just
now
i
thought
you
d
be
different
all
have
you
anything
else
to
tell
me
horace
understood
her
significant
glance
and
shook
his
head
i
ll
let
you
know
everything
as
soon
as
i
know
having
learnt
the
day
and
hour
of
lord
s
funeral
ada
and
fanny
made
a
point
of
walking
out
to
get
a
glimpse
of
it
the
procession
of
vehicles
in
grove
lane
excited
their
contempt
so
far
was
it
from
the
splendour
they
had
anticipated
there
you
are
said
ada
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
it
s
going
to
be
a
jolly
good
take
in
for
you
after
all
if
he
d
died
worth
much
they
wouldn
t
have
buried
him
like
fanny
s
heart
sank
she
could
conceive
no
other
explanation
of
a
simple
burial
save
lack
of
means
or
resentment
in
the
survivors
at
the
disposition
made
of
his
property
by
the
deceased
when
on
the
morrow
horace
told
her
that
his
father
had
strictly
charged
mr
barmby
to
have
him
buried
in
the
simplest
mode
compatible
with
decency
she
put
it
down
to
the
old
man
s
excessive
meanness
on
this
occasion
she
learnt
the
contents
of
lord
s
will
and
having
learnt
them
got
rid
of
horace
as
soon
as
possible
that
she
might
astonish
her
sisters
with
the
report
in
the
afternoon
of
that
day
beatrice
had
an
appointment
with
luckworth
crewe
she
was
to
meet
him
at
the
office
he
had
just
taken
in
farringdon
street
whence
they
would
repair
to
a
solicitor
s
in
the
same
neighbourhood
for
the
discussion
of
legal
business
connected
with
miss
french
s
enterprise
she
climbed
the
staircase
of
a
big
building
and
was
directed
to
the
right
door
by
the
sound
of
crewe
s
voice
loudly
and
jocularly
discoursing
he
stood
with
two
men
in
the
open
doorway
and
at
the
sight
of
beatrice
waved
a
hand
to
her
take
your
hook
you
fellows
i
have
an
the
men
glancing
at
miss
french
facetiously
went
their
way
how
do
old
chum
it
s
all
in
a
mess
yet
hold
your
skirts
together
come
along
this
through
and
shavings
and
an
overpowering
smell
of
paint
beatrice
followed
to
inspect
the
premises
which
consisted
of
three
rooms
one
very
much
the
smallest
about
ten
feet
square
three
workmen
were
busy
and
one
fitting
up
shelves
whistled
a
melody
with
shrillness
stop
that
damned
noise
shouted
crewe
i
ve
told
you
once
already
try
it
on
again
my
lad
and
i
ll
drop
you
down
the
well
of
the
staircase
you
ve
too
much
breath
you
the
other
workmen
laughed
it
was
evident
that
crewe
had
made
friends
with
them
all
won
t
be
bad
when
we
get
the
decks
cleared
he
remarked
to
beatrice
plenty
of
room
to
make
twenty
thousand
a
year
or
he
checked
himself
and
asked
in
a
subdued
voice
seen
anything
of
the
lords
beatrice
nodded
with
a
smile
and
heard
about
the
will
have
you
no
i
haven
t
come
into
this
little
he
closed
the
door
behind
them
and
looked
at
his
companion
with
curiosity
but
without
show
of
eagerness
well
it
s
a
joke
said
miss
french
is
it
how
fanny
s
that
mad
about
it
she
d
got
it
into
her
silly
noddle
that
horace
lord
would
drop
in
for
a
fortune
at
once
as
it
is
he
gets
nothing
at
all
for
two
years
except
what
the
barmbys
choose
to
give
him
and
if
he
marries
before
he
s
he
loses
everything
every
cent
crewe
whistled
a
bar
of
a
then
burst
into
laughter
that
s
how
the
old
joker
has
done
them
is
it
quite
right
too
the
lad
doesn
t
know
his
own
mind
yet
let
fanny
wait
if
she
really
wants
him
and
if
she
can
keep
hold
of
him
but
what
are
the
figures
nothing
startling
of
course
i
don
t
know
all
the
ins
and
outs
of
it
but
horace
lord
will
get
seven
thousand
pounds
and
a
sixth
share
in
the
piano
business
old
barmby
and
his
son
are
trustees
they
may
let
horace
have
just
what
they
think
fit
during
the
next
two
years
if
he
wants
money
to
go
into
business
with
they
may
advance
what
they
like
but
for
two
years
he
s
simply
in
their
hands
to
be
looked
after
and
if
he
marries
pop
goes
the
weasel
and
miss
lord
asked
crewe
carelessly
beatrice
pointed
a
finger
at
him
you
want
to
know
badly
don
t
you
well
it
s
pretty
much
the
same
as
the
other
to
begin
with
if
she
marries
before
the
age
of
she
gets
nothing
whatever
if
she
doesn
t
marry
there
s
two
hundred
a
year
to
live
on
and
to
keep
up
the
oh
i
was
forgetting
she
must
not
only
keep
single
to
but
continue
to
live
where
she
does
now
with
that
old
servant
of
theirs
for
companion
at
she
takes
the
same
as
her
brother
about
seven
thousand
and
a
sixth
share
in
lord
and
again
crewe
whistled
that
s
about
three
years
still
to
live
in
grove
lane
he
said
thoughtfully
well
the
old
joker
has
pinned
them
and
no
mistake
i
thought
he
had
more
to
of
course
you
did
remarked
beatrice
significantly
look
here
old
fellow
don
t
talk
to
me
like
that
he
replied
but
with
a
reproof
not
to
be
mistaken
i
thought
nothing
about
it
in
the
way
that
mean
but
it
isn
t
much
after
living
as
he
has
done
i
suppose
you
don
t
know
how
the
money
lies
i
have
it
all
from
fanny
and
it
s
a
wonder
she
remembered
as
much
as
she
oh
fanny
s
pretty
smart
in
but
did
she
say
what
becomes
of
the
money
if
either
of
them
break
the
terms
goes
to
a
girl
s
orphanage
somewhere
in
the
old
man
s
country
but
there
s
more
than
i
ve
accounted
for
yet
young
barmby
s
sisters
get
legacies
a
hundred
and
fifty
apiece
and
last
of
all
the
old
servant
has
an
annuity
of
two
hundred
he
made
her
a
sort
of
housekeeper
not
long
ago
says
thought
no
end
of
don
t
know
anything
about
her
said
crewe
absently
i
should
like
to
know
the
business
details
what
arrangement
was
made
i
wonder
when
he
took
barmby
into
partnership
i
shouldn
t
be
surprised
if
he
simply
gave
him
a
share
old
barmby
and
lord
were
great
chums
then
you
see
samuel
barmby
has
a
third
of
his
profits
to
pay
over
beatrice
went
on
to
speak
of
the
mysterious
damerel
concerning
whom
she
had
heard
from
fanny
the
man
of
business
gave
particular
ear
to
this
story
and
asked
many
questions
of
a
sudden
as
if
dismissing
matters
which
hardly
concerned
him
he
said
mirthfully
you
ve
heard
about
the
row
at
lillie
bridge
yesterday
i
saw
something
about
it
in
the
well
i
was
there
pure
chance
haven
t
been
at
that
kind
of
place
for
a
year
and
more
it
was
a
match
for
the
sprint
championship
and
a
hundred
pounds
timed
for
six
o
clock
but
at
a
quarter
past
the
chaps
hadn
t
come
forward
i
heard
men
talking
and
guessed
there
was
something
wrong
they
thought
it
a
job
when
it
got
round
that
there
d
be
no
race
the
excitement
broke
out
and
then
i
d
have
given
something
for
you
to
see
it
first
of
all
there
was
a
rush
for
the
a
shilling
a
piece
you
know
we
d
all
paid
there
were
a
whole
lot
of
chaps
fellow
countrymen
of
mine
and
i
heard
some
of
them
begin
to
send
up
a
roar
that
sounded
dangerous
i
was
tumbling
along
with
the
crowd
quite
ready
for
a
scrimmage
i
rather
enjoy
a
fight
now
and
then
and
all
at
once
some
chap
sang
out
just
in
front
let
s
burst
up
the
blooming
show
only
he
used
a
stronger
word
and
a
lot
of
us
yelled
hooray
and
to
it
we
went
i
don
t
mean
i
had
a
hand
in
the
pillaging
and
smashing
it
wouldn
t
have
done
for
a
man
just
starting
in
business
to
be
up
at
the
but
i
looked
on
and
laughed
laughed
till
i
could
hardly
stand
they
set
to
work
on
the
refreshment
place
it
was
a
scene
if
you
like
fellows
knocking
off
the
heads
of
bottles
and
drinking
all
they
could
then
pouring
the
rest
on
the
ground
glasses
and
decanters
flying
right
and
left
sandwiches
and
buns
and
i
don
t
know
what
pelting
about
they
splintered
all
the
small
wood
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
and
set
fire
to
it
and
before
you
could
say
jack
robinson
the
whole
place
was
blazing
the
bobbies
got
it
pretty
warm
bottles
and
stones
and
logs
of
wood
i
saw
one
poor
chap
with
the
side
of
his
face
cut
clean
open
it
does
one
good
a
real
like
that
i
feel
better
than
for
the
last
month
and
the
swearing
that
went
on
it
s
a
long
time
since
i
heard
such
downright
hearty
solid
swearing
there
was
one
chap
i
kept
near
and
he
swore
for
a
full
hour
without
stopping
except
when
he
had
a
bottle
at
his
mouth
he
only
stopped
when
he
was
speechless
with
i
wish
i
d
been
there
said
miss
french
gaily
it
must
have
been
no
end
of
a
right
down
good
spree
and
it
wasn
t
over
till
about
eight
o
clock
i
stayed
till
the
police
had
cleared
the
grounds
and
then
came
home
laughing
all
the
way
it
did
me
good
i
tell
you
well
shall
we
go
and
see
the
lawyer
suggested
beatrice
right
you
have
a
drink
first
nice
quiet
place
round
in
fleet
street
glass
of
wine
no
as
you
please
old
think
this
shop
ll
do
don
t
you
you
must
come
round
when
it
s
finished
but
i
daresay
you
ll
be
here
many
a
time
on
oh
i
and
as
they
went
down
the
stairs
crewe
laughed
again
at
his
recollections
of
yesterday
s
sport
chapter
gusts
of
an
october
evening
swept
about
the
square
of
the
old
inn
and
made
rushes
at
the
windows
all
the
more
cosy
seemed
it
here
in
tarrant
s
room
where
a
big
fire
fed
into
smokeless
placidity
purred
and
crackled
pipe
in
mouth
tarrant
lay
back
in
his
big
chair
gracefully
indolent
as
ever
opposite
him
illuminating
her
face
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
nancy
turned
over
an
illustrated
volume
her
husband
s
gift
today
many
were
the
presents
he
had
bestowed
upon
her
costly
some
of
them
all
flattering
the
recipient
by
a
presumption
of
taste
and
intelligence
she
had
been
here
since
early
in
the
afternoon
it
was
now
near
seven
o
clock
nancy
looked
at
the
pictures
but
inattentively
her
brows
slightly
knitted
and
her
lips
often
on
the
point
of
speech
that
concerned
some
other
matter
since
the
summer
holiday
she
had
grown
a
trifle
thinner
in
face
her
beauty
was
no
longer
allied
with
perfect
health
a
heaviness
appeared
on
her
eyelids
of
course
she
wore
the
garb
of
mourning
and
its
effect
was
to
emphasise
the
maturing
change
manifest
in
her
features
for
several
minutes
there
had
passed
no
word
but
tarrant
s
face
no
less
than
his
companion
s
signalled
discussion
in
suspense
no
unfriendly
discussion
yet
one
that
excited
emotional
activity
in
both
of
them
the
young
man
his
falling
to
his
knee
first
broke
silence
i
look
at
it
in
this
way
we
ought
to
regard
ourselves
as
married
people
living
under
exceptionally
favourable
circumstances
one
has
to
bear
in
mind
the
brutal
fact
that
man
and
wife
as
a
rule
see
a
great
deal
too
much
of
each
other
thence
most
of
the
ills
of
married
life
squabblings
discontents
small
or
great
disgusts
leading
often
enough
to
people
get
to
think
themselves
victims
of
incompatibility
when
they
are
merely
suffering
from
a
foolish
custom
the
habit
of
being
perpetually
together
in
fact
it
s
an
immoral
custom
what
does
immorality
mean
but
anything
that
tends
to
kill
love
to
harden
hearts
the
common
practice
of
man
and
wife
occupying
the
same
room
is
monstrous
gross
it
s
astounding
that
women
of
any
sensitiveness
endure
it
in
fact
their
sensitiveness
is
destroyed
even
an
ordinary
honeymoon
generally
ends
in
quarrel
as
it
certainly
ought
to
you
and
i
escape
all
that
each
of
us
lives
a
separate
life
with
the
result
that
we
like
each
other
better
as
time
goes
on
i
speak
for
myself
at
all
events
i
look
forward
to
our
meetings
i
open
the
door
to
you
with
as
fresh
a
feeling
of
pleasure
as
when
you
came
first
if
we
had
been
ceaselessly
together
day
and
night
well
you
know
the
result
as
well
as
i
he
spoke
with
indulgent
gravity
in
the
tone
of
kindness
to
which
his
voice
was
naturally
attuned
and
nancy
s
reply
though
it
expressed
a
stronger
feeling
struck
the
same
harmonious
note
i
can
agree
with
all
that
but
it
applies
to
people
married
in
the
ordinary
way
i
was
speaking
of
ourselves
placed
as
we
i
don
t
pretend
to
like
the
concealment
said
tarrant
for
one
thing
there
s
a
suggestion
of
dishonour
about
it
we
ve
gone
over
all
that
oh
i
don
t
mean
that
for
a
moment
it
isn
t
really
dishonourable
my
father
could
never
have
objected
to
for
my
husband
he
only
wanted
to
guard
me
mary
says
so
and
he
told
her
everything
he
thought
me
a
silly
flighty
girl
and
was
afraid
i
should
be
trapped
for
the
sake
of
my
money
i
wish
oh
how
i
wish
i
had
had
the
courage
to
tell
him
he
would
have
seen
you
and
liked
and
trusted
you
how
could
he
help
it
might
have
been
better
but
who
knows
whether
he
would
have
seen
me
with
your
eyes
nancy
yes
yes
but
i
was
going
to
say
she
hesitated
say
there
are
so
many
difficulties
before
us
not
if
we
continue
to
think
of
each
other
as
we
do
now
do
you
mean
it
might
be
discovered
yes
through
no
fault
of
she
hesitated
again
quite
sure
you
haven
t
told
anybody
no
tarrant
had
a
doubt
on
this
point
he
strongly
suspected
that
jessica
morgan
knew
the
truth
but
he
shrank
from
pressing
nancy
to
an
avowal
of
repeated
falsehood
then
it
s
very
unlikely
we
should
be
found
out
who
would
dream
of
tracking
you
here
for
instance
and
suppose
we
were
seen
together
in
the
street
or
in
the
country
who
would
suspect
anything
more
than
and
that
is
not
forbidden
no
but
but
but
suppose
i
she
rose
crossed
to
him
seated
herself
on
his
knee
and
put
an
arm
about
his
neck
before
she
had
spoken
another
word
tarrant
understood
the
smile
on
his
face
lost
its
spontaneity
a
bitter
taste
seemed
to
distort
his
lips
you
think
you
are
afraid
he
heard
a
monosyllable
and
sat
silent
this
indeed
had
not
entered
into
his
calculations
but
why
not
he
could
hardly
say
he
had
ignored
the
not
unimportant
detail
as
it
lurked
among
possibilities
perhaps
had
willingly
ignored
it
as
introducing
a
complication
oppressive
to
his
indolence
to
his
hodiernal
philosophy
and
now
he
arraigned
the
very
divinity
whom
hitherto
he
had
called
upon
to
justify
him
all
at
once
he
grew
cold
to
nancy
the
lulled
objections
to
matrimony
awoke
in
him
again
again
he
felt
that
he
had
made
a
fool
of
himself
nancy
was
better
than
he
had
thought
he
either
loved
her
or
felt
something
towards
her
not
easily
distinguishable
from
love
his
inferior
she
remained
but
not
in
the
sense
he
had
formerly
attributed
to
the
word
her
mind
and
heart
excelled
the
idle
conception
he
had
formed
of
them
but
nancy
was
not
his
wife
as
the
world
understands
that
relation
merely
his
mistress
and
as
a
mistress
he
found
her
charming
lovable
what
she
now
hinted
at
would
shatter
the
situation
tarrant
thought
not
of
the
peril
to
her
material
prospects
on
that
score
he
was
indifferent
save
in
so
far
as
mr
lord
s
will
helped
to
maintain
their
mutual
independence
but
he
feared
for
his
liberty
in
the
first
place
and
in
the
second
abhorred
the
change
that
must
come
over
nancy
herself
nancy
a
mother
he
repelled
the
image
as
though
it
degraded
her
delicacy
however
constrained
him
to
a
disguise
of
these
emotions
he
recognised
the
human
sentiments
that
should
have
weighed
with
him
like
a
man
of
cultivated
intelligence
he
admitted
their
force
their
beauty
none
the
less
a
syllable
on
nancy
s
lips
had
arrested
the
current
of
his
feelings
and
made
him
wish
again
that
he
had
been
either
more
or
less
a
man
of
honour
down
at
teignmouth
and
yet
he
said
to
himself
could
i
have
resisted
an
appeal
for
marriage
that
comes
of
being
so
confoundedly
humane
it
s
a
marvel
that
i
didn
t
find
myself
married
to
some
sheer
demirep
long
nancy
was
speaking
will
it
make
you
love
me
less
i
have
always
refused
to
prophesy
about
love
he
answered
with
forced
playfulness
but
you
wouldn
t
you
wouldn
t
we
should
find
ourselves
in
a
very
awkward
i
know
said
nancy
hurriedly
i
can
t
see
what
would
be
done
but
you
seem
colder
to
me
all
at
once
lionel
surely
it
oughtn
t
to
to
turn
you
away
from
me
perhaps
i
am
this
referred
to
the
alarming
possibility
and
tarrant
caught
at
hope
yes
she
might
be
mistaken
they
wouldn
t
talk
about
it
he
shook
it
away
let
me
fill
my
pipe
again
yes
you
can
do
it
for
me
that
reminds
me
of
a
story
harvey
munden
tells
a
man
he
knew
a
doctor
got
married
and
there
was
nothing
his
wife
wouldn
t
do
for
him
as
he
sat
with
her
one
evening
smoking
a
patient
called
him
into
the
he
had
only
just
lighted
a
fresh
pipe
and
laid
it
down
regretfully
i
ll
keep
it
in
for
you
said
his
wife
and
she
did
so
with
dainty
and
fearful
puffs
at
long
intervals
but
the
doctor
was
detained
and
when
he
came
back
well
the
poor
wife
had
succumbed
to
her
devotion
she
never
kept
in
his
pipe
again
nancy
tried
to
laugh
she
was
in
her
own
chair
again
and
sat
resting
her
cheek
upon
her
hand
gazing
at
the
fire
how
is
it
lionel
that
no
one
ever
knocks
at
your
door
when
i
m
oh
very
simple
i
sport
the
oak
as
you
but
don
t
you
think
some
friend
of
yours
might
see
a
light
in
your
window
and
come
up
if
so
respecte
la
no
no
i
don
t
like
you
when
you
begin
to
use
french
words
i
think
it
reminds
me
of
once
when
you
did
it
a
long
time
ago
and
i
thought
you
never
tarrant
laughed
weren
t
they
strange
those
meetings
of
ours
at
champion
hill
what
did
you
think
me
arrogant
insolent
that
is
my
tendency
with
strangers
i
but
i
was
asking
you
a
question
said
nancy
you
mean
that
no
one
would
knock
if
he
saw
your
outer
door
closed
but
what
would
they
think
no
doubt
that
i
was
working
i
am
supposed
to
be
secretly
engaged
on
some
immortal
nancy
pondered
i
do
hope
no
one
that
knows
you
will
ever
see
me
coming
or
what
could
it
matter
they
wouldn
t
know
who
you
but
to
have
such
things
thought
i
should
feel
it
just
as
if
they
knew
me
i
believe
i
could
never
come
why
what
s
the
matter
with
you
tarrant
asked
you
have
tears
in
your
eyes
you
re
not
well
he
checked
himself
on
an
unwelcome
thought
and
proceeded
more
carelessly
do
you
suppose
for
a
moment
that
any
friend
of
mine
is
ass
enough
to
think
with
condemnation
of
a
girl
who
should
come
to
my
rooms
whatever
the
circumstances
you
must
get
rid
of
that
provincialism
let
us
call
it
they
wouldn
t
think
it
any
harm
even
if
my
dear
girl
we
have
outgrown
those
ancestral
tarrant
s
humour
never
quite
deserted
him
least
of
all
when
he
echoed
the
talk
of
his
world
but
his
listener
kept
a
grave
face
we
have
nothing
to
do
with
grundy
s
but
you
believe
in
a
morality
of
some
kind
she
pursued
with
diffidence
you
used
the
word
immoral
just
nancy
felt
no
consciousness
of
the
gulf
that
yawned
between
herself
as
she
spoke
now
and
the
old
self
which
had
claimed
her
mind
was
so
completely
unsettled
that
she
never
tried
to
connect
its
present
state
with
its
earlier
phases
for
the
most
part
her
sensations
and
her
reflections
were
concerned
with
the
crude
elements
of
life
the
exceptional
moments
she
spent
in
a
world
of
vague
joys
and
fears
wherein
thought
properly
speaking
had
no
share
before
she
could
outlive
the
shock
of
passion
which
seemed
at
once
to
destroy
and
to
her
she
was
confronted
with
the
second
supreme
crisis
of
woman
s
existence
its
natural
effects
complicated
with
the
trials
of
her
peculiar
position
tarrant
s
reception
of
her
disclosure
came
as
a
new
disturbance
she
felt
bewildered
and
helpless
he
preoccupied
with
the
anxiety
he
affected
to
dismiss
had
no
inclination
to
debate
ethical
problems
for
a
while
he
talked
jestingly
and
at
length
fell
into
a
mood
of
silence
nancy
did
not
stay
much
longer
they
parted
without
mention
of
the
subject
uppermost
in
their
thoughts
they
had
no
stated
times
of
meeting
tarrant
sent
an
invitation
whenever
it
pleased
him
when
the
next
arrived
in
about
a
week
nancy
made
reply
that
she
did
not
feel
well
enough
to
leave
home
it
was
the
briefest
letter
tarrant
had
yet
received
from
her
and
the
least
affectionate
he
kept
silence
for
a
few
days
and
wrote
again
this
time
nancy
responded
as
usual
and
came
to
the
involuntary
question
in
his
eyes
hers
answered
unmistakably
for
the
first
few
minutes
they
said
very
little
to
each
other
tarrant
was
struggling
with
repulsions
and
solicitudes
of
which
he
felt
more
than
half
ashamed
nancy
reticent
for
many
reasons
not
the
least
of
them
a
resentful
pride
which
for
the
moment
overcame
her
fondness
endeavoured
to
speak
of
trivial
things
they
kept
apart
and
at
length
the
embarrassment
of
the
situation
held
them
both
mute
with
a
nervous
movement
the
young
man
pushed
forward
the
chair
on
which
nancy
usually
sat
i
see
that
you
don
t
look
nancy
turned
to
the
window
she
had
unbuttoned
her
jacket
and
taken
off
her
gloves
but
went
no
further
in
the
process
of
preparing
herself
for
the
ordinary
stay
of
some
hours
did
something
in
my
letter
displease
you
inquired
her
husband
you
mean
because
i
didn
t
come
no
i
really
didn
t
feel
well
tarrant
hesitated
but
the
softer
feeling
prevailed
with
him
he
helped
to
remove
her
jacket
seated
her
by
the
fire
and
led
her
to
talk
so
there
s
no
doubt
of
it
her
silence
made
answer
then
of
course
there
s
just
as
little
doubt
as
to
what
we
must
his
voice
had
not
a
convincing
sincerity
he
waited
for
the
reply
you
mean
that
we
can
t
keep
the
secret
how
is
it
possible
but
you
are
vexed
about
it
you
don
t
speak
to
me
as
you
used
to
i
don
t
think
you
ever
will
it
will
make
no
change
in
said
tarrant
with
resolute
good
humour
all
i
want
to
be
sure
of
is
that
you
are
quite
prepared
for
the
change
in
your
are
dear
her
tone
and
look
deprived
the
inquiry
of
unpleasant
implication
he
answered
her
with
a
laugh
you
know
exactly
how
i
regard
it
in
one
way
i
should
feel
relief
of
course
i
don
t
like
the
thought
that
i
shall
have
caused
you
to
suffer
such
a
i
should
never
have
that
thought
but
are
you
quite
sure
about
the
result
to
yourself
you
remember
saying
that
you
couldn
t
be
certain
how
how
it
will
be
taken
at
champion
hill
i
was
going
to
tell
you
the
latest
report
from
there
it
is
very
doubtful
whether
i
should
ever
have
to
break
the
they
did
not
look
at
each
other
everything
in
that
quarter
must
be
long
since
settled
pray
remember
that
i
have
no
vast
expectations
quite
certainly
it
won
t
be
a
large
fortune
very
likely
not
more
than
your
own
but
enough
to
live
on
no
doubt
i
know
the
value
of
money
no
man
better
it
would
be
pleasant
enough
to
play
with
thousands
a
year
but
i
don
t
grumble
so
long
as
i
have
a
nancy
meditated
and
sighed
oh
it
s
a
pity
father
never
meant
me
to
be
penniless
if
i
married
i
suppose
of
course
not
they
both
meditated
it
wouldn
t
be
possible
would
it
why
he
answered
with
a
laugh
last
time
you
were
here
you
spoke
in
quite
the
other
way
you
were
utterly
miserable
at
the
thought
of
living
through
it
yes
i
don
t
know
whether
i
could
even
if
what
are
you
thinking
of
i
ve
been
talking
with
mary
she
replied
after
an
uneasy
pause
she
has
lived
with
us
so
long
and
since
father
s
death
it
seems
quite
natural
to
make
a
friend
of
her
no
one
could
be
more
devoted
to
me
than
she
is
i
believe
there
s
nothing
she
wouldn
t
do
i
believe
i
might
trust
her
with
any
the
obvious
suggestion
demanded
thought
said
tarrant
looking
up
have
you
seen
your
aunt
again
nancy
s
face
changed
to
a
cold
expression
no
and
i
don
t
think
i
probably
you
were
as
little
sympathetic
to
her
as
she
to
i
don
t
like
her
was
the
brief
reply
i
ve
had
curious
thoughts
about
that
lady
said
tarrant
smiling
the
mystery
it
seems
to
me
is
by
no
means
solved
you
think
she
really
your
aunt
impossible
to
doubt
it
any
one
could
see
her
likeness
to
horace
at
ah
you
didn
t
mention
that
i
had
a
fear
that
she
might
be
simply
an
adventuress
with
an
eye
to
your
brother
s
she
is
what
she
says
i
m
sure
but
i
shall
never
ask
her
to
come
and
see
me
again
and
i
don
t
think
she
ll
want
to
that
would
be
fortunate
if
if
we
wished
tarrant
nodded
at
the
same
moment
they
heard
a
sound
that
startled
them
that
s
a
knock
at
the
door
said
nancy
rising
as
if
to
escape
so
it
is
banging
with
a
stick
let
him
bang
it
must
be
a
stranger
or
he
d
respect
the
they
sat
listening
the
knock
sounded
again
loud
and
prolonged
tarrant
joked
about
it
but
a
third
time
came
the
summons
i
may
as
well
go
and
see
who
it
oh
you
won
t
let
any
one
of
course
not
sit
he
went
out
closing
the
behind
him
and
opened
the
heavy
door
which
should
have
ensured
his
privacy
for
five
minutes
he
was
absent
then
returned
with
a
face
portending
news
it
was
vawdrey
he
knew
my
habit
of
sporting
the
oak
and
wouldn
t
go
away
till
he
had
made
sure
my
grandmother
is
dying
they
telegraphed
to
vawdrey
in
the
city
and
he
came
here
at
once
to
tell
me
i
must
go
perhaps
i
shall
be
too
what
did
he
think
of
your
keeping
him
outside
i
made
some
sort
of
excuse
he
s
a
fellow
it
didn
t
matter
stay
a
little
after
i
m
gone
stay
as
long
as
you
like
in
fact
you
can
pull
to
the
inner
door
when
you
what
did
the
telegram
say
mrs
tarrant
sinking
come
of
course
we
expected
it
it
s
raining
hard
wait
and
see
if
it
stops
you
must
take
care
of
for
this
nancy
was
not
slow
in
exhibiting
her
gratitude
which
served
as
mask
of
the
pleasure
she
could
not
decently
betray
when
her
husband
had
hastened
off
she
sat
for
a
few
minutes
in
thought
then
alone
here
for
the
first
time
she
began
to
walk
about
the
rooms
and
to
make
herself
more
intimately
acquainted
with
their
contents
chapter
whilst
she
was
thus
occupied
darkness
came
on
she
did
not
care
to
light
the
lamp
so
made
herself
ready
and
stole
forth
the
rain
had
ceased
walking
alone
at
night
was
a
pleasure
in
which
she
now
indulged
herself
pretty
frequently
at
such
times
mary
woodruff
believed
her
in
the
company
of
miss
morgan
the
marked
sobriety
of
her
demeanour
since
lord
s
death
and
the
friendliness
even
the
affection
she
evinced
in
their
common
life
at
home
had
set
mary
s
mind
at
ease
concerning
her
no
murmur
at
her
father
s
will
had
escaped
nancy
in
this
respect
very
unlike
her
brother
who
when
grief
was
forgotten
declared
himself
she
seemed
perfectly
content
with
the
conditions
laid
upon
her
and
the
sincerity
of
her
mourning
could
not
be
doubted
anxious
to
conciliate
the
girl
in
every
honest
way
mary
behaved
to
her
with
the
same
external
respect
as
ever
and
without
a
hint
of
express
guardianship
the
two
were
on
excellent
terms
it
seemed
likely
that
before
long
they
would
have
the
house
to
themselves
already
horace
had
spoken
of
taking
lodgings
in
a
part
of
london
more
congruous
with
the
social
aspirations
encouraged
by
his
aunt
damerel
from
chancery
lane
she
passed
into
fleet
street
and
sauntered
along
with
observation
of
she
was
unspeakably
relieved
by
the
events
of
the
afternoon
it
would
now
depend
upon
her
own
choice
whether
she
preserved
her
secret
or
declared
herself
a
married
woman
her
husband
had
proved
himself
generous
as
well
as
loving
yes
she
repeated
to
herself
generous
and
loving
her
fears
and
suspicions
had
been
baseless
tarrant
s
death
freed
them
from
all
sordid
considerations
a
short
time
perhaps
a
day
or
two
might
put
an
end
to
irregularities
and
enable
her
to
hold
up
her
head
once
more
feeling
hungry
she
entered
a
restaurant
and
dined
not
carelessly
but
with
fastidious
choice
of
viands
this
was
enjoyable
she
began
to
look
more
like
herself
of
a
few
months
ago
she
would
return
to
camberwell
by
train
from
ludgate
hill
at
the
circus
crowding
traffic
held
her
back
for
a
minute
or
two
just
as
she
ran
forward
a
familiar
voice
caused
her
to
stop
again
she
became
flurried
lost
her
head
stood
still
amid
a
tumult
of
omnibuses
cabs
and
carts
but
a
hand
grasped
her
by
the
arm
and
led
her
safely
to
the
opposite
pavement
what
do
you
mean
by
shouting
at
me
in
the
street
were
her
first
words
the
person
addressed
was
luckworth
crewe
he
had
by
no
means
anticipated
such
wrathful
greeting
and
stood
in
confusion
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
lord
i
didn
t
think
i
shouted
i
only
meant
to
call
your
why
should
you
call
my
attention
her
cheeks
were
flushed
with
anger
she
regarded
him
as
though
he
were
a
stranger
guilty
of
mere
insolence
i
don
t
wish
to
speak
to
with
astonishment
crewe
found
himself
alone
but
a
rebuff
such
as
this
so
irrational
as
he
thought
it
so
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
miss
lord
s
behaviour
he
could
by
no
means
accept
nancy
was
walking
towards
the
he
followed
he
watched
her
as
she
took
a
ticket
then
put
himself
in
her
way
with
all
the
humility
of
countenance
he
could
command
i
m
so
sorry
i
offended
you
it
wasn
t
the
right
thing
to
do
i
ought
to
have
waited
till
you
were
across
i
m
a
blundering
sort
of
fellow
in
those
things
do
let
me
beg
your
pardon
and
forgive
she
was
calmer
now
though
still
tremulous
but
for
the
attack
of
nervousness
she
would
have
met
crewe
with
nothing
worse
than
a
slight
reserve
to
mark
a
change
in
their
relations
very
soon
after
her
father
s
death
he
had
written
a
becoming
letter
though
it
smacked
of
commercial
phraseology
to
the
hope
expressed
in
it
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
call
upon
her
in
a
few
weeks
time
nancy
made
no
reply
a
fortnight
later
he
wrote
again
this
time
reminding
her
with
modest
propriety
of
what
had
occurred
between
them
before
she
left
town
in
august
nancy
responded
and
in
grave
friendly
language
begged
him
to
think
of
her
no
more
he
must
not
base
the
slightest
hope
upon
anything
she
might
have
said
to
her
surprise
crewe
held
his
peace
and
she
saw
him
now
for
the
first
time
since
their
ascent
of
the
monument
i
m
ashamed
that
i
lost
my
temper
crewe
i
am
in
a
hurry
to
get
in
the
at
ludgate
hill
it
is
not
easy
to
detain
by
chivalrous
discourse
a
lady
bent
on
escaping
but
crewe
attempted
it
he
subdued
his
voice
spoke
rapidly
and
with
emotion
implored
that
he
might
be
heard
for
a
moment
would
she
not
permit
him
to
call
upon
her
he
had
waited
respecting
her
seclusion
he
asked
for
nothing
whatever
but
permission
to
call
as
any
acquaintance
might
have
you
heard
i
have
opened
an
office
in
farringdon
street
i
should
so
like
to
tell
you
all
about
it
what
i
m
doing
no
one
calls
to
see
me
said
nancy
with
firmness
i
wish
to
live
quite
alone
i
m
very
sorry
to
seem
is
it
anything
i
ve
done
no
nothing
whatever
i
assure
you
nothing
let
us
say
i
can
t
stop
another
they
shook
hands
and
so
parted
you
re
back
early
said
mary
when
nancy
entered
the
yes
i
left
jessica
to
her
books
sooner
than
usual
the
examination
draws
quiet
sad
diligent
ever
mary
kept
unchanged
the
old
domestic
routine
there
was
the
same
perfect
order
the
same
wholesome
economy
as
when
she
worked
under
the
master
s
eyes
nancy
had
nothing
to
do
but
enjoy
the
admirable
care
with
which
she
was
surrounded
she
took
it
all
as
a
matter
of
course
never
having
considered
the
difference
between
her
own
home
and
those
of
her
acquaintances
horace
had
dined
and
was
gone
out
again
they
talked
of
him
mary
said
that
he
had
spoken
of
moving
into
lodgings
very
soon
of
course
he
doesn
t
tell
us
everything
said
nancy
i
feel
pretty
sure
that
he
s
going
to
leave
the
office
but
how
he
means
to
live
i
don
t
understand
perhaps
damerel
will
give
him
money
or
lend
it
him
i
only
hope
she
may
break
it
off
between
him
and
hasn
t
he
told
you
that
fanny
is
often
with
damerel
with
her
nancy
exclaimed
he
never
said
a
word
of
it
to
he
said
so
to
me
this
evening
and
laughed
when
i
looked
well
then
i
don
t
pretend
to
understand
what
s
going
on
we
can
t
do
about
nine
o
clock
the
servant
entered
the
room
bringing
miss
lord
a
note
which
had
just
been
left
by
a
nancy
seeing
that
the
address
was
in
tarrant
s
hand
opened
it
with
a
flutter
of
joy
such
a
proceeding
as
this
openly
sending
a
note
by
a
messenger
could
only
mean
that
her
husband
no
longer
cared
to
preserve
secrecy
to
her
astonishment
the
envelope
contained
but
a
hurried
line
not
a
word
yet
to
any
one
without
fail
come
afternoon
at
with
what
show
of
calmness
she
could
command
she
looked
up
at
her
companion
the
idea
of
his
sending
in
this
way
it
s
that
crewe
i
ve
told
you
of
i
met
him
as
i
was
coming
home
and
had
to
speak
to
him
rather
sharply
to
get
rid
of
him
here
comes
his
apology
foolish
man
living
in
perpetual
falsehood
nancy
felt
no
shame
at
a
fiction
such
as
this
mere
had
never
seemed
to
her
a
weighty
matter
of
the
law
and
she
was
now
grown
expert
in
lies
but
tarrant
s
message
disturbed
her
gravely
something
unforeseen
must
have
happened
something
perhaps
calamitous
she
passed
a
miserable
night
when
she
ascended
the
stairs
at
staple
inn
next
afternoon
it
wanted
ten
minutes
to
four
as
usual
at
her
coming
the
outer
door
stood
open
exposing
the
door
with
the
knocker
she
had
just
raised
her
hand
when
with
a
sound
of
voices
from
inside
the
door
opened
and
tarrant
appeared
in
company
with
a
stranger
she
stepped
back
tarrant
after
a
glance
paid
no
attention
to
her
all
right
he
was
saying
to
his
friend
i
shall
see
you
in
a
day
or
two
old
the
stranger
had
observed
nancy
but
withheld
his
eyes
from
her
and
quickly
vanished
down
the
stairs
who
was
that
she
whispered
i
told
you
four
o
it
is
no
ten
minutes
to
at
least
it
doesn
t
matter
but
if
you
had
been
punctual
you
wouldn
t
have
had
a
nancy
had
dropped
into
a
chair
white
and
shaking
tarrant
s
voice
abruptly
reproachful
affected
her
scarcely
less
than
the
preceding
shock
in
the
struggle
to
recover
herself
she
sobbed
and
choked
and
at
length
burst
into
tears
tarrant
spoke
impatiently
what
s
the
matter
surely
you
are
not
so
childish
she
stood
up
and
went
into
the
bedroom
where
she
remained
for
several
minutes
returning
at
length
without
her
jacket
but
with
her
hat
still
on
i
couldn
t
help
it
and
you
shouldn
t
speak
to
me
in
that
way
i
have
felt
ill
all
the
looking
at
her
the
young
man
said
to
himself
that
love
was
one
thing
wedded
life
another
he
could
make
allowance
for
nancy
s
weakness
but
it
was
beyond
his
power
to
summon
the
old
warmth
and
tenderness
if
henceforth
he
loved
her
it
must
be
with
husband
s
love
a
phrase
which
signified
to
him
something
as
distinct
as
possible
from
the
ardour
he
had
known
a
moral
attachment
instead
of
a
passionate
desire
and
there
was
another
reason
for
his
intolerant
mood
you
hadn
t
spoken
to
any
one
before
you
got
my
note
why
are
you
treating
me
like
this
are
you
ashamed
that
your
friend
saw
me
ashamed
not
at
who
did
he
think
i
was
i
don
t
know
he
doesn
t
know
anything
about
you
at
all
events
as
you
may
guess
i
have
something
not
very
pleasant
to
tell
i
didn
t
mean
to
be
unkind
it
was
only
the
surprise
at
seeing
you
when
i
opened
the
door
i
had
calculated
the
exact
time
but
never
mind
you
look
cold
warm
yourself
at
the
fire
you
shall
drink
a
glass
of
wine
it
will
put
your
nerves
right
no
i
want
nothing
tell
me
at
once
what
it
but
tarrant
quietly
brought
a
bottle
and
glass
from
his
cupboard
nancy
again
refused
pettishly
until
you
have
drunk
he
said
with
a
smile
of
i
shall
tell
you
i
don
t
know
what
i
ve
done
to
make
you
like
her
sobs
and
tears
returned
after
a
moment
of
impatience
tarrant
went
up
to
her
with
the
glass
laid
a
hand
upon
her
shoulder
and
kissed
her
now
come
be
reasonable
we
have
uncommonly
serious
things
to
talk
what
did
your
friend
think
of
me
that
you
were
one
of
the
prettiest
girls
he
had
ever
been
privileged
to
see
and
that
i
was
an
enviable
fellow
to
have
such
a
visitor
there
now
another
sip
and
let
us
have
some
colour
back
into
your
cheeks
there
s
bad
news
nancy
confoundedly
bad
news
dear
girl
my
grandmother
was
dead
when
i
got
there
well
the
foolish
old
woman
has
been
muddling
her
affairs
for
a
long
time
speculating
here
and
there
without
taking
any
one
s
advice
and
so
on
and
the
result
is
that
she
leaves
nothing
at
nancy
was
mute
less
than
nothing
indeed
she
owed
a
few
hundreds
that
she
had
no
means
of
paying
the
joke
of
the
thing
is
that
she
has
left
an
elaborate
will
with
legacies
to
people
myself
first
of
all
if
she
had
been
so
good
as
to
die
two
years
ago
i
should
have
come
in
for
a
thousand
a
year
or
so
no
one
suspected
what
was
going
on
she
never
allowed
vawdrey
the
one
man
who
could
have
been
useful
to
her
to
have
an
inkling
of
the
affair
an
advertising
broker
got
her
in
his
clutches
vawdrey
s
lawyer
has
been
going
through
her
papers
and
finds
everything
quite
intelligible
the
money
has
gone
in
lumps
good
after
bad
swindling
of
course
but
perfectly
legal
swindling
nothing
to
be
done
about
it
a
minute
or
two
before
her
death
she
gasped
out
some
words
of
revelation
to
the
nurse
enough
to
set
vawdrey
on
the
track
when
he
was
still
the
listener
said
nothing
well
i
had
a
talk
with
vawdrey
he
s
a
blackguard
but
not
a
bad
fellow
wished
he
could
help
me
but
didn
t
quite
see
how
unless
i
would
go
into
business
however
he
had
a
suggestion
to
for
nancy
the
pause
was
charged
with
apprehensions
she
seemed
to
discover
in
her
husband
s
face
a
purpose
which
he
knew
would
excite
her
resistance
he
and
i
have
often
talked
about
my
friend
sutherland
in
the
bahamas
and
vawdrey
has
an
idea
that
there
ll
be
a
profitable
opening
in
that
quarter
before
long
sutherland
has
written
to
me
lately
that
he
thinks
of
bestirring
himself
in
the
projects
i
ve
told
you
about
he
has
got
the
old
man
s
consent
to
borrow
money
on
the
property
now
vawdrey
naturally
enough
would
like
sutherland
to
join
him
in
starting
a
company
the
thoughts
of
such
men
run
only
on
companies
so
he
offers
if
i
will
go
out
to
the
bahamas
for
a
month
or
two
and
look
about
me
and
put
myself
in
a
position
to
make
some
kind
of
report
he
offers
to
pay
my
expenses
of
course
if
the
idea
came
to
anything
and
a
company
got
floated
i
should
have
again
he
paused
the
listener
had
wide
miserable
eyes
well
i
told
him
at
once
that
i
would
accept
the
proposal
i
have
no
right
to
refuse
all
i
possess
in
the
world
at
this
moment
is
about
sixty
pounds
if
i
sold
all
my
books
and
furniture
they
might
bring
another
sixty
or
so
what
then
is
to
become
of
me
i
must
set
to
work
at
something
and
here
s
the
first
work
that
comes
to
hand
but
his
voice
softened
this
puts
us
face
to
face
with
a
very
grave
question
doesn
t
it
are
we
to
relinquish
your
money
and
be
both
of
us
penniless
or
is
there
any
possibility
of
saving
it
how
we
how
could
the
secret
be
kept
voice
and
countenance
joined
in
utter
dismay
it
doesn
t
seem
to
me
said
tarrant
slowly
a
downright
impossibility
it
be
managed
with
the
help
of
your
friend
mary
and
granting
that
you
yourself
have
the
courage
but
he
made
a
large
gesture
of
course
i
can
t
exact
any
such
thing
of
you
it
must
seem
practicable
to
you
what
are
we
to
do
if
my
money
is
lost
don
t
say
he
smiled
generously
perhaps
too
generously
a
man
must
support
his
wife
i
shall
arrange
it
somehow
of
course
so
that
have
no
anxiety
but
his
voice
dropped
lionel
she
sprang
up
and
approached
him
as
he
stood
by
the
fireplace
you
won
t
leave
me
dear
how
can
you
think
of
going
so
far
away
for
months
and
leaving
me
as
i
am
now
oh
you
won
t
leave
me
he
arched
his
eyebrows
and
smiled
gently
if
that
s
how
you
look
at
it
well
i
must
you
can
do
something
here
nancy
continued
with
rapid
pleading
you
can
write
for
the
papers
you
always
said
you
could
yes
you
did
say
so
we
don
t
need
very
much
to
live
upon
at
first
i
shall
be
content
a
moment
you
mean
that
the
money
must
be
she
had
meant
it
but
under
his
look
her
confused
thoughts
took
a
new
direction
no
we
needn
t
lose
it
only
stay
near
me
and
i
will
keep
the
secret
through
everything
you
will
only
need
then
just
to
support
yourself
and
that
is
so
easy
i
will
tell
mary
how
it
is
she
can
be
trusted
i
am
sure
she
can
she
would
do
anything
for
me
she
knows
that
father
was
not
thinking
of
a
man
such
as
you
it
would
be
cruelly
wrong
if
i
lost
everything
i
will
tell
her
and
she
will
help
me
scarcely
any
one
comes
to
the
house
as
it
is
and
i
will
pretend
to
have
bad
health
and
shut
myself
up
and
then
when
the
time
comes
mary
will
go
away
with
me
and
and
the
child
shall
be
taken
care
of
by
some
people
we
can
trust
to
be
kind
to
it
horace
is
going
to
live
in
lodgings
and
damerel
i
am
sure
won
t
come
to
see
me
again
and
i
can
get
rid
of
other
people
the
barmbys
shall
think
i
am
sulking
about
the
will
i
m
sure
they
think
already
that
i
dislike
them
because
of
it
let
them
think
it
i
will
refuse
presently
to
see
them
at
all
it
s
only
a
few
months
if
i
tell
people
i
m
not
well
nobody
will
feel
surprised
if
i
go
away
for
a
month
or
two
now
soon
mary
would
go
with
me
of
course
i
might
go
for
december
and
january
father
didn
t
mean
i
was
never
to
have
change
of
air
then
there
would
be
february
and
march
at
home
and
then
i
might
go
away
again
till
near
the
end
of
may
i
m
sure
we
can
manage
she
stopped
breathless
tarrant
who
had
listened
with
averted
face
turned
and
spoke
judicially
there
s
one
thing
you
re
forgetting
nancy
do
you
propose
that
we
shall
never
acknowledge
the
child
remember
that
even
if
you
were
bold
enough
after
our
second
marriage
to
acknowledge
it
in
the
face
of
scandal
that
wouldn
t
be
safe
any
one
if
suspicion
is
aroused
can
find
out
when
we
were
actually
we
can
t
think
of
that
the
child
may
not
tarrant
moved
and
the
movement
startled
nancy
it
meant
that
she
had
pained
him
perhaps
made
him
think
of
her
with
repugnance
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
saying
you
know
i
don
t
wish
that
but
all
i
can
think
of
now
is
to
keep
you
near
me
i
can
t
bear
to
be
separated
from
you
i
love
you
so
much
more
than
you
love
let
me
just
tell
you
what
i
had
in
mind
nancy
supposing
the
secret
can
be
kept
we
must
eventually
live
abroad
that
is
to
say
if
our
child
is
not
to
grow
up
a
stranger
to
us
which
neither
you
nor
i
could
wish
now
at
nassau
the
capital
of
the
bahamas
a
lot
of
americans
always
spend
the
winter
if
i
made
acquaintances
among
them
it
might
be
a
very
useful
step
it
would
be
preparing
for
the
to
nancy
this
sounded
far
from
convincing
she
argued
against
it
in
a
perfectly
natural
way
and
as
any
one
else
would
have
done
who
knew
tarrant
more
than
once
he
had
declared
to
her
that
he
would
rather
die
than
drag
out
his
life
in
one
of
the
new
countries
that
he
could
not
breathe
in
an
atmosphere
of
commercialism
unrelieved
by
historic
associations
nancy
urged
that
it
would
be
better
to
make
a
home
on
the
continent
whither
they
could
go
at
any
moment
without
a
sense
of
exile
so
it
comes
to
this
he
interrupted
with
an
air
of
resignation
i
must
refuse
vawdrey
s
offer
and
in
doing
so
refuse
an
excellent
chance
of
providing
for
our
future
what
is
by
no
means
improbable
the
secret
should
be
discovered
i
must
turn
to
journalism
or
be
a
clerk
well
and
good
my
wife
decrees
and
he
began
to
hum
an
air
as
if
the
matter
were
dismissed
there
was
a
long
silence
how
long
would
you
be
away
murmured
nancy
at
length
i
suppose
two
months
at
november
the
second
of
those
months
you
might
be
spending
as
you
said
away
from
london
down
in
devon
perhaps
i
can
t
blame
your
thoughts
about
it
but
it
seems
doesn
t
it
a
trifle
inconsiderate
when
you
think
what
may
result
from
my
would
you
promise
me
to
be
back
by
the
end
of
the
year
not
promise
nancy
but
do
my
best
letters
take
fourteen
days
that
s
all
you
should
hear
by
every
why
not
promise
because
i
can
t
foresee
how
much
i
may
have
to
do
there
and
how
long
it
will
take
me
but
you
may
be
very
sure
that
vawdrey
won
t
pay
expenses
for
longer
than
he
can
help
it
has
occurred
to
me
that
i
might
get
materials
for
some
magazine
articles
that
would
help
to
float
me
with
the
editors
you
know
if
it
s
nancy
sighed
if
i
consented
if
i
did
my
best
not
to
stand
in
your
way
would
you
love
me
better
when
you
came
back
the
answer
was
a
pleased
laugh
why
there
he
cried
you
ve
given
in
a
nutshell
the
whole
duty
of
a
wife
who
wishes
to
be
loved
nancy
tried
to
laugh
with
him
chapter
he
must
be
a
strong
man
whom
the
sudden
stare
of
penury
does
not
daunt
and
in
some
measure
debase
tarrant
whatever
the
possibilities
of
his
nature
had
fallen
under
a
spell
of
indolent
security
which
declared
its
power
only
when
he
came
face
to
face
with
the
demand
for
vigorous
action
the
moment
found
him
a
sheer
poltroon
what
is
it
possible
that
i
am
henceforth
penniless
i
to
whom
the
gods
were
so
gracious
i
without
warning
flung
from
sheltered
comfort
on
to
the
bare
road
side
where
i
must
either
toil
or
beg
the
thing
seemed
unintelligible
he
had
never
imagined
such
ruin
of
his
hopes
for
the
first
time
he
turned
anxious
thoughts
upon
the
money
to
which
his
wife
was
would
be
might
be
entitled
he
computed
the
chances
of
success
in
the
deception
he
and
she
were
practising
and
knew
with
shame
that
he
must
henceforth
be
party
to
a
vulgar
fraud
could
nancy
be
trusted
to
carry
through
this
elaborate
imposition
difficult
for
the
woman
was
it
not
a
certainty
that
some
negligence
or
some
accident
must
disclose
her
secret
then
had
he
a
wife
and
child
upon
his
hands
to
support
even
as
common
men
support
wife
and
child
by
incessant
labour
the
prospect
chilled
him
if
he
went
to
the
west
indies
his
absence
would
heighten
the
probability
of
nancy
s
detection
yet
he
desired
to
escape
from
her
not
to
abandon
her
of
that
thought
he
was
incapable
but
to
escape
the
duty
repulsive
to
his
imagination
of
encouraging
her
through
the
various
stages
of
their
fraud
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
he
would
write
affectionate
consolatory
letters
face
to
face
with
her
could
he
support
the
show
of
tenderness
go
through
an
endless
series
of
emotional
interviews
always
reminding
himself
that
the
end
in
view
was
hard
cash
not
for
love
s
sake
he
loved
her
less
than
before
she
proved
herself
his
wife
in
earnest
veritable
love
no
man
knew
better
would
have
impelled
him
to
save
himself
and
her
from
a
degrading
position
was
he
committing
himself
to
a
criminality
which
the
law
would
visit
hardly
that
until
he
entered
into
possession
of
money
fraudulently
obtained
in
miserable
he
fell
to
the
most
sordid
calculations
supposing
their
plot
revealed
would
nancy
in
fact
be
left
without
resources
surely
not
with
her
brother
her
aunt
her
lifelong
friends
the
barmbys
to
take
thought
for
her
she
could
not
suffer
extremities
and
upon
this
he
blushed
relief
better
to
make
up
his
mind
that
the
secret
must
inevitably
out
for
the
moment
nancy
believed
she
had
resigned
herself
to
his
departure
and
that
she
had
strength
to
go
through
with
the
long
ordeal
but
a
woman
in
her
situation
can
not
be
depended
upon
to
pursue
a
consistent
course
it
is
nature
s
ordinance
that
motherhood
shall
be
attained
through
phases
of
mental
disturbance
which
leave
the
sufferer
scarce
a
pretence
of
responsibility
nancy
would
play
strange
pranks
by
which
assuredly
he
would
be
driven
to
exasperation
if
they
passed
under
his
eyes
he
had
no
mind
to
be
called
father
perhaps
even
his
humanity
might
fail
under
the
test
to
which
as
a
lover
he
had
given
scarce
a
casual
thought
by
removing
himself
and
awaiting
the
issue
afar
off
he
gained
time
and
opportunity
for
reflection
of
course
his
wife
could
not
come
to
want
that
after
all
was
the
one
clearly
comforting
thought
her
old
servant
would
take
good
care
of
her
happen
what
might
he
must
taste
of
liberty
again
before
sinking
into
the
humdrum
of
married
life
the
thought
of
an
ocean
voyage
of
the
new
life
amid
tropic
splendours
excited
his
imagination
all
the
more
because
it
blended
with
the
thought
of
recovered
freedom
marriage
had
come
upon
him
with
unfair
abruptness
for
such
a
change
as
that
even
the
ordinary
bachelor
demands
a
season
preparative
much
more
then
the
young
man
who
revelled
in
a
philosophic
sense
of
detachment
who
wrote
his
motto
vixi
hodie
for
marriage
he
was
simply
unfit
forced
together
he
and
his
wife
would
soon
be
mutually
detestable
a
temporary
parting
might
mature
in
the
hearts
of
both
that
affection
of
which
the
seed
was
undeniably
planted
with
passion
they
had
done
the
enduring
tenderness
of
a
reasonable
love
must
now
unite
them
were
they
to
be
united
at
all
and
to
give
such
love
a
chance
of
growing
in
him
tarrant
felt
that
he
must
lose
sight
of
nancy
until
her
child
was
born
yes
it
had
begun
already
the
trial
he
dreaded
a
letter
from
nancy
written
and
posted
only
an
hour
or
two
after
her
return
home
a
long
distracted
letter
would
he
forgive
her
for
seeming
to
be
an
obstacle
in
the
way
of
what
he
had
proposed
would
he
promise
her
to
be
faithful
would
he
he
had
hardly
patience
to
read
it
through
the
next
evening
on
returning
home
about
ten
o
clock
he
was
startled
by
the
sight
of
nancy
s
figure
at
the
foot
of
his
staircase
what
has
happened
nothing
don
t
be
frightened
but
i
wanted
to
see
you
she
gripped
his
hand
how
long
have
you
waited
what
hours
but
this
is
downright
madness
such
a
night
as
this
couldn
t
you
put
a
note
for
me
in
the
don
t
don
t
speak
so
i
wanted
to
see
she
hurried
her
words
as
if
afraid
he
would
refuse
to
listen
i
have
told
mary
i
wanted
you
to
know
come
in
but
there
s
no
fire
and
you
re
chilled
through
do
you
want
to
be
ill
what
outrageous
silliness
her
vitality
was
indeed
at
a
low
ebb
and
reproaches
made
her
weep
tarrant
half
carried
her
up
to
his
room
made
a
light
and
fell
to
his
knees
at
let
me
do
it
nancy
exclaimed
let
me
wait
upon
you
if
you
don
t
sit
still
and
keep
quiet
you
ll
make
me
angry
in
then
you
re
not
angry
with
me
i
couldn
t
help
no
i
m
afraid
you
couldn
t
tarrant
muttered
cheerlessly
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
mary
will
be
our
friend
she
was
speechless
with
astonishment
at
first
i
didn
t
know
what
she
would
say
she
looked
at
me
as
she
had
never
looked
before
as
if
she
were
the
mistress
and
i
the
servant
but
see
what
i
have
come
to
all
i
felt
was
a
dread
lest
she
should
think
it
her
duty
to
cast
me
off
i
haven
t
a
bit
of
pride
left
i
could
have
fallen
on
my
knees
before
her
i
almost
did
but
she
was
very
good
and
kind
and
gentle
at
last
she
ll
do
everything
she
can
for
the
fire
in
a
blaze
tarrant
stood
up
and
regarded
it
gloomily
well
did
she
think
it
possible
he
asked
at
length
yes
she
did
she
said
it
would
be
very
difficult
but
the
secret
might
be
kept
if
i
were
strong
enough
and
i
strong
enough
i
be
it
doesn
t
look
like
it
said
tarrant
taking
the
edge
off
his
words
with
a
smile
i
won
t
come
again
in
this
way
where
have
you
been
tonight
oh
with
which
friends
where
he
moved
impatiently
people
you
don
t
know
nancy
and
wouldn
t
care
about
if
you
did
do
you
know
what
time
it
is
do
tell
me
where
you
have
been
it
isn
t
prying
into
your
affairs
your
friends
ought
to
be
mine
at
least
i
mean
i
ought
to
know
their
names
and
something
about
them
suppose
i
were
to
tell
you
i
had
been
spending
the
evening
with
friends
my
dear
girl
i
shouldn
t
ask
a
question
unless
you
invited
it
however
it
s
better
to
tell
you
that
i
have
been
making
arrangements
to
sublet
these
chambers
i
can
t
afford
to
keep
them
even
if
there
were
any
use
in
it
harvey
munden
has
introduced
me
to
a
man
who
is
likely
to
relieve
me
of
the
burden
i
shall
warehouse
my
books
and
furniture
then
you
are
going
really
going
to
leave
england
he
affected
astonishment
in
truth
nothing
now
could
surprise
him
but
wasn
t
it
all
decided
between
us
didn
t
you
repeat
it
in
your
letter
yes
i
know
but
i
didn
t
think
it
would
come
so
we
won
t
talk
about
it
said
tarrant
firmly
for
one
thing
there
s
no
time
come
closer
to
the
fire
and
get
warm
through
then
i
must
see
you
nancy
hung
her
head
when
in
a
few
moments
she
looked
up
again
it
was
to
say
drily
there
s
no
need
for
you
to
see
me
i
m
going
to
at
all
why
you
don
t
care
much
about
me
i
might
as
well
be
run
over
or
anything
to
this
remark
no
sort
of
answer
was
vouchsafed
nancy
sat
with
her
feet
on
the
fender
and
tarrant
kept
up
a
great
blaze
with
chips
which
sputtered
out
their
moisture
before
they
began
to
crackle
he
and
she
both
seemed
intent
on
this
process
of
combustion
now
you
re
quite
warm
said
the
young
man
as
if
speaking
to
a
child
and
it
s
time
to
nancy
rose
obediently
gazed
at
him
with
dreaming
eyes
and
suffered
herself
to
be
led
away
by
the
arm
in
chancery
lane
tarrant
hailed
a
crawling
hansom
when
they
were
driving
rapidly
southward
nancy
began
to
question
him
about
the
date
of
his
departure
she
learnt
that
he
might
be
gone
in
less
than
a
week
if
you
could
behave
quietly
and
sensibly
we
would
have
an
evening
to
make
final
i
can
she
answered
with
a
calm
that
surprised
him
if
you
go
without
letting
me
see
you
again
i
don
t
know
what
i
might
do
but
i
can
be
as
sensible
as
you
are
if
i
m
treated
he
grasped
her
hand
remember
dear
girl
that
i
have
a
good
deal
to
worry
me
just
now
do
you
suppose
i
leave
you
with
a
light
heart
if
you
can
persuade
me
that
you
care
i
care
a
good
deal
more
than
i
can
easily
say
your
position
is
a
very
hard
one
harder
than
mine
but
i
m
going
away
to
work
for
your
future
i
see
clearly
that
it
s
the
best
thing
i
could
do
whether
vawdrey
s
ideas
come
to
anything
or
not
i
shall
make
profit
out
of
the
journey
i
mean
to
write
i
think
it
s
all
i
can
do
to
any
purpose
and
the
material
i
shall
get
together
over
there
will
give
me
a
start
don
t
think
i
am
because
i
talk
in
this
way
if
i
broke
down
so
much
the
worse
for
both
of
us
the
time
has
come
for
serious
but
we
shan
t
lose
my
money
i
ve
made
up
my
mind
we
shan
it
s
impossible
for
you
to
guard
against
every
danger
we
must
be
prepared
for
the
worst
and
that
responsibility
rests
on
me
try
and
keep
your
mind
at
ease
whatever
happens
to
protect
you
is
my
duty
and
i
shall
not
fail
in
speaking
thus
tarrant
felt
the
glow
of
virtue
his
words
were
perfectly
sincere
but
had
reference
to
a
future
which
his
thoughts
left
comfortably
vague
they
were
to
meet
again
probably
for
the
definite
parting
three
days
hence
tarrant
whose
desire
for
escape
had
now
become
incontrollable
used
the
intervening
time
in
a
rush
of
preparations
he
did
not
debate
with
himself
as
to
the
length
of
his
sojourn
in
the
west
indies
that
must
be
determined
by
circumstances
explicitly
he
had
avoided
a
promise
on
the
subject
what
money
he
possessed
he
would
take
with
him
it
might
be
to
his
interest
for
nancy
s
likewise
to
exceed
the
term
of
absence
provided
for
in
his
stipulations
with
vawdrey
but
all
he
deliberately
thought
of
was
the
getting
away
impatient
with
nancy
because
of
the
vagaries
resultant
from
her
mental
and
physical
state
he
himself
exhibited
a
flagrant
triumph
of
instinct
over
reason
once
in
enjoyment
of
liberty
he
would
reflect
like
a
practical
man
on
the
details
of
his
position
review
and
recognise
his
obligations
pay
his
debt
to
honour
but
liberty
first
of
all
not
his
the
nature
to
accept
bondage
it
demoralised
him
made
him
do
and
say
things
of
which
he
was
ashamed
only
let
him
taste
the
breezes
of
ocean
and
the
healthful
spirit
which
is
one
with
rectitude
would
again
inspire
him
much
to
his
surprise
he
neither
saw
nor
heard
from
nancy
until
the
hour
appointed
she
came
very
punctually
on
opening
the
door
to
her
with
an
air
of
resolute
cheerfulness
he
saw
something
in
her
face
that
removed
the
necessity
for
playing
a
part
it
was
the
look
which
had
so
charmed
him
in
their
the
indescribable
look
characteristic
of
nancy
and
of
her
alone
a
gleam
between
smile
and
laughter
a
glance
mingling
pride
with
submission
a
silent
note
of
personality
which
thrilled
the
senses
and
touched
the
heart
what
now
he
asked
holding
her
hand
and
gazing
at
her
some
good
news
none
that
i
know
of
how
hot
your
room
is
why
you
look
glad
to
see
me
was
i
ever
anything
else
she
answered
him
with
a
smile
it
s
a
very
pleasant
surprise
he
continued
watching
her
as
she
threw
off
her
things
i
expected
a
doleful
visage
eyes
red
with
did
you
see
how
much
a
man
thinks
of
himself
if
you
choose
to
go
away
i
choose
to
think
as
little
of
you
as
possible
that
s
common
sense
isn
t
it
i
don
t
want
you
to
cry
about
oh
yes
you
do
it
flatters
you
and
you
like
flattery
but
i
ve
been
too
obliging
i
feel
myself
again
and
there
s
no
more
flattery
for
you
till
you
come
back
i
don
t
ask
you
when
that
will
be
i
ask
you
nothing
at
all
i
am
independent
of
tarrant
grew
uneasy
he
feared
that
this
mood
of
jest
would
change
only
too
suddenly
and
her
collapse
into
feminine
feebleness
be
the
more
complete
be
as
independent
as
you
like
he
said
only
keep
your
love
for
oh
indeed
it
s
your
experience
is
it
that
the
two
things
can
go
together
that
s
the
difference
between
man
and
woman
i
suppose
i
shall
love
you
just
as
little
as
possible
and
how
little
that
will
be
perhaps
i
had
better
not
tell
still
he
stood
gazing
at
her
you
look
very
beautiful
i
know
i
saw
it
for
myself
before
i
left
home
but
we
won
t
talk
about
that
when
do
you
go
my
goods
will
be
warehoused
and
the
next
day
i
go
to
i
m
glad
it
s
so
soon
we
shan
t
need
to
see
each
other
again
smoke
your
pipe
i
m
going
to
make
a
cup
of
kiss
me
first
you
forgot
when
you
came
you
get
no
kiss
by
ordering
it
beg
for
it
prettily
and
we
ll
what
does
it
all
mean
nancy
how
can
you
have
altered
like
this
you
prefer
me
as
i
was
last
time
not
i
indeed
you
make
me
feel
that
it
will
be
very
hard
to
leave
you
i
shall
carry
away
a
picture
of
you
quite
different
from
the
dreary
face
that
i
had
got
to
be
afraid
nancy
laughed
and
of
a
sudden
held
out
her
hands
to
him
haven
t
i
thought
of
that
these
were
the
very
words
i
hoped
to
hear
from
you
now
beg
for
a
kiss
and
you
shall
have
never
perhaps
had
they
spent
together
so
harmonious
an
evening
nancy
s
tenderness
took
at
length
a
graver
turn
but
she
remained
herself
face
and
speech
untroubled
by
morbid
influence
i
won
t
see
you
again
she
said
because
i
mightn
t
be
able
to
behave
as
i
can
i
am
myself
for
a
long
time
i
have
been
living
i
don
t
know
tarrant
murmured
something
about
her
state
of
health
yes
i
know
all
about
that
a
strange
thought
came
to
me
last
night
when
my
father
was
alive
i
fretted
because
i
couldn
t
be
independent
i
wanted
to
be
quite
free
to
live
as
i
chose
i
looked
forward
to
it
as
the
one
thing
desirable
now
i
look
back
on
that
as
a
time
of
liberty
i
am
in
bondage
now
threefold
how
threefold
to
you
because
i
love
you
and
couldn
t
cease
loving
you
however
i
tried
then
to
my
father
s
will
which
makes
me
live
in
hiding
as
if
i
were
a
criminal
and
then
what
other
tyranny
you
mustn
t
expect
all
my
love
before
long
some
one
else
will
rule
over
what
an
exchange
i
have
made
and
i
was
going
to
be
so
to
the
listener
her
speech
seemed
to
come
from
a
maturer
mind
than
she
had
hitherto
revealed
but
he
suffered
from
the
thought
that
this
might
be
merely
a
pathological
phase
in
reminding
him
of
her
motherhood
she
checked
the
flow
of
his
emotion
you
ll
remember
nancy
went
on
that
i
m
not
enjoying
myself
whilst
you
are
away
i
don
t
want
you
to
be
unhappy
only
to
think
of
me
and
keep
in
mind
what
i
m
going
through
if
you
do
that
you
won
t
be
away
from
me
longer
than
you
can
it
was
said
with
unforced
pathos
and
tarrant
s
better
part
made
generous
reply
if
you
find
it
too
hard
dear
write
to
me
and
tell
me
and
there
shall
be
an
end
of
never
you
think
me
wretchedly
weak
but
you
shall
see
it
s
of
your
own
free
will
you
undertake
it
yes
of
my
own
free
will
she
answered
firmly
i
won
t
come
to
you
penniless
it
isn
t
right
i
should
do
so
my
father
didn
t
mean
that
if
i
had
had
the
sense
and
the
courage
to
tell
him
all
this
misery
would
have
been
spared
that
money
is
mine
by
every
right
and
i
won
t
lose
it
not
only
for
your
sake
and
my
own
there
is
some
one
else
to
think
tarrant
gave
her
a
kind
look
don
t
count
upon
it
trust
to
i
like
to
hear
you
say
that
but
i
don
t
wish
you
to
be
put
to
proof
you
are
not
the
kind
of
man
to
make
how
do
you
mean
it
as
you
like
to
take
it
silly
boy
don
t
i
love
you
just
because
you
are
one
of
the
men
if
you
hadn
t
a
penny
in
the
world
i
should
love
you
just
the
same
and
i
couldn
t
love
you
more
if
you
had
the
change
which
tarrant
expected
did
not
come
to
the
end
she
was
brave
and
bright
her
own
best
self
she
said
without
a
tear
refused
to
let
him
accompany
her
and
so
even
as
she
had
resolved
left
in
her
husband
s
mind
an
image
beckoning
his
return
part
iv
the
veiled
figure
chapter
before
his
admission
to
a
partnership
in
lord
s
business
samuel
barmby
lived
with
his
father
and
two
sisters
in
coldharbour
lane
their
house
was
small
old
and
crumbling
for
lack
of
repair
the
landlord
his
having
but
a
year
or
two
to
run
looked
on
with
equanimity
whilst
the
building
decayed
under
any
circumstances
the
family
must
soon
have
sought
a
home
elsewhere
and
samuel
s
good
fortune
enabled
them
to
take
a
house
in
dagmar
road
not
far
from
grove
lane
a
new
and
most
respectable
house
with
bay
windows
rising
from
the
basement
to
the
second
storey
samuel
notwithstanding
his
breadth
of
mind
privately
admitted
the
charm
of
such
an
address
as
dagmar
road
which
looks
well
at
the
head
of
and
falls
with
sonority
from
the
lips
the
barmby
sisters
lucy
and
amelia
by
name
were
unpretentious
young
women
without
personal
attractions
and
soberly
educated
they
professed
a
form
of
dissent
their
reading
was
in
certain
religious
and
periodicals
rarely
in
books
domestic
occupations
took
up
most
of
their
time
and
they
seldom
had
any
engagements
at
appointed
seasons
a
festivity
in
connection
with
the
chapel
called
them
forth
it
kept
them
in
a
flutter
for
many
days
and
gave
them
a
headache
in
the
strictest
sense
their
life
was
provincial
nominally
denizens
of
london
they
dwelt
as
remote
from
everything
metropolitan
as
though
camberwell
were
a
village
of
the
midlands
if
they
suffered
from
discontent
no
one
heard
of
it
a
confession
by
one
or
the
other
that
she
felt
dull
excited
the
sister
s
surprise
and
invariably
led
to
the
suggestion
of
a
little
their
brother
they
regarded
with
admiration
tempered
by
anxiety
great
talents
they
knew
by
report
were
often
perilous
to
the
possessor
and
there
was
reason
to
fear
that
samuel
bennett
barmby
had
not
resisted
all
the
temptations
to
which
his
intellect
exposed
him
at
the
age
of
he
made
a
startling
announcement
the
chapel
no
longer
satisfied
the
needs
of
his
soul
and
he
found
himself
summoned
to
join
the
church
of
england
as
by
law
established
religious
intolerance
not
being
a
family
characteristic
barmby
and
his
daughters
though
they
looked
grave
over
the
young
man
s
apostasy
admitted
his
freedom
in
this
matter
their
respected
friend
lord
belonged
to
the
church
and
it
could
not
be
thought
that
so
a
man
walked
in
the
way
to
perdition
at
the
same
time
samuel
began
to
exhibit
a
liking
for
social
pleasures
which
were
it
might
be
hoped
innocent
but
as
they
kept
him
from
home
of
evenings
gave
some
ground
for
uneasiness
he
had
joined
a
society
of
young
men
who
met
for
intellectual
debate
and
his
success
as
an
orator
fostered
the
spiritual
pride
already
discernible
in
him
his
next
step
could
not
be
regarded
without
concern
for
he
became
a
member
of
the
national
sunday
league
deceptive
name
at
first
the
miss
barmbys
supposed
this
was
a
union
for
the
it
appalled
them
to
discover
that
the
league
had
quite
an
opposite
tendency
that
its
adherents
sallied
forth
together
on
sunday
excursions
that
they
received
tickets
for
sunday
admission
to
picture
galleries
and
in
various
other
ways
offended
orthodox
feeling
but
again
the
father
and
sisters
gave
patient
ear
to
samuel
s
elaborate
arguments
they
became
convinced
that
he
had
no
evil
intentions
the
elder
girl
having
caught
up
a
pregnant
phrase
in
some
periodical
she
approved
began
to
remark
that
samuel
had
a
modern
mind
and
this
eventually
consoled
them
when
it
began
to
be
observed
that
samuel
talked
somewhat
frequently
of
miss
lord
the
implied
suggestion
caused
a
tremor
of
confused
feeling
to
the
miss
barmbys
nancy
seemed
an
enigmatic
person
they
had
tried
to
like
her
but
could
not
they
objected
to
her
assumption
of
superiority
and
were
in
grave
doubt
as
to
her
opinions
on
cardinal
points
of
faith
and
behaviour
yet
when
it
appeared
a
possibility
that
their
brother
might
woo
miss
lord
and
win
her
for
a
wife
the
girls
did
their
best
to
see
her
in
a
more
favourable
light
not
for
a
moment
did
it
occur
to
them
that
nancy
could
regard
a
proposal
from
samuel
as
anything
but
an
honour
to
she
might
behave
slightingly
for
they
were
of
her
own
sex
and
not
clever
but
a
girl
who
prided
herself
on
intellectual
attainments
must
of
course
look
up
to
samuel
bennett
with
reverence
in
their
unworldliness
of
a
truth
they
were
good
simple
creatures
the
slight
difference
of
social
position
seemed
unimportant
and
with
samuel
s
elevation
to
a
partnership
even
that
one
shadowy
obstacle
was
removed
henceforth
they
would
meet
nancy
in
a
conciliatory
spirit
and
if
she
insisted
upon
it
bow
down
before
her
barmby
senior
whose
years
drew
nigh
to
had
a
great
advantage
in
point
of
physical
health
over
his
old
friend
stephen
lord
and
his
mind
enjoyed
a
placidity
which
promised
him
length
of
days
since
the
age
of
seventeen
he
had
plied
a
pen
in
the
office
of
a
life
assurance
company
where
his
salary
by
small
and
slow
increments
had
grown
at
length
to
two
hundred
and
fifty
a
year
himself
a
small
and
slow
person
he
had
every
reason
to
be
satisfied
with
this
progress
and
hoped
for
no
further
advance
he
was
of
eminently
sober
mind
profoundly
conscientious
and
quite
devoid
of
social
ambition
points
of
character
which
explained
the
long
intimacy
between
him
and
stephen
lord
yet
one
habit
he
possessed
which
foreshadowed
the
intellectual
composition
of
his
son
he
loved
to
write
letters
to
the
newspapers
at
very
long
intervals
one
of
these
communications
achieved
the
honour
of
type
and
then
mr
barmby
was
radiant
with
modest
he
never
signed
such
letters
with
his
own
name
but
chose
a
pseudonym
befitting
the
subject
thus
if
moved
to
civic
indignation
by
pieces
of
on
the
pavement
he
styled
himself
urban
rambler
if
anxious
to
protest
against
the
overcrowding
of
bus
or
his
signature
was
otium
cum
when
he
took
a
holiday
at
the
seaside
unwonted
leisure
and
novel
circumstances
prompted
him
to
address
local
editors
at
considerable
length
the
preservation
of
decency
by
bathers
was
then
his
favourite
topic
and
he
would
sign
pudor
or
perchance
his
public
epistles
if
collected
would
have
made
an
entertaining
and
instructive
volume
so
admirably
did
they
represent
one
phase
of
the
popular
mind
no
sir
this
sentence
frequently
occurred
it
was
not
thus
that
our
fathers
achieved
national
and
civic
and
again
all
the
feelings
of
an
english
parent
revolt
or
and
now
sir
where
is
this
to
end
a
phrase
applied
at
one
moment
to
the
prospects
of
religion
and
morality
at
another
to
the
multiplication
of
on
a
sunday
afternoon
barmby
often
read
aloud
to
his
daughters
and
in
general
his
chosen
book
was
paradise
these
performances
had
an
indescribable
solemnity
but
it
unfortunately
happened
that
as
his
fervour
increased
the
reader
became
regardless
of
aspirates
thus
at
the
culmination
of
satanic
impiety
he
would
give
forth
with
shaking
voice
orrors
ail
and
thou
profoundest
ell
receive
thy
new
possessor
this
though
it
did
not
distress
the
girls
was
painful
to
samuel
bennett
who
had
given
no
little
care
to
the
correction
of
similar
lapses
in
his
own
speech
samuel
conceived
himself
much
ahead
of
his
family
quite
uneducated
in
any
legitimate
sense
of
the
word
he
had
yet
learnt
that
such
a
thing
as
education
existed
and
by
dint
of
busy
perusal
of
penny
popularities
had
even
become
familiar
with
names
and
phrases
with
modes
of
thought
and
of
ambition
appertaining
to
a
world
for
ever
closed
against
him
he
spoke
of
culture
and
imagined
himself
far
on
the
way
to
attain
it
his
mind
was
packed
with
the
oddest
jumble
of
incongruities
herbert
spencer
jostled
with
charles
bradlaugh
matthew
arnold
with
samuel
smiles
in
one
breath
he
lauded
george
eliot
in
the
next
was
enthusiastic
over
a
novel
by
henry
wood
from
puerile
facetiae
he
passed
to
speculations
on
the
origin
of
being
and
with
equally
light
heart
save
for
pilgrim
s
progress
and
robinson
crusoe
he
had
read
no
english
classic
since
boyhood
indeed
he
had
probably
read
no
book
at
all
for
much
diet
of
newspapers
rendered
him
all
but
incapable
of
sustained
attention
whatever
he
seemed
to
know
of
serious
authors
came
to
him
at
second
or
third
hand
avowing
his
faith
in
christianity
when
with
orthodox
people
in
the
society
of
sceptics
he
permitted
himself
to
smile
at
the
old
faiths
though
he
preferred
to
escape
this
temptation
the
nonconformist
conscience
still
reigning
within
him
at
home
he
posed
as
a
anglican
and
having
somewhere
read
that
tennyson
s
in
memoriam
represented
this
attitude
he
spoke
of
the
poem
as
one
of
the
books
that
have
made
me
what
i
his
circle
of
acquaintances
lay
apart
from
that
in
which
the
lords
moved
it
consisted
for
the
most
part
of
young
men
humbly
endowed
in
the
matter
of
income
and
making
little
pretence
of
social
dignity
when
others
resorted
to
theatre
or
or
places
not
so
readily
designated
samuel
and
his
friends
met
together
to
discourse
on
subjects
of
which
they
knew
somewhat
less
than
nothing
some
of
them
occasionally
held
audacious
language
especially
when
topics
such
as
the
relations
of
the
sexes
invited
their
wisdom
they
had
read
something
somewhere
which
urged
them
to
cast
off
the
trammels
of
conventional
thought
they
ventured
to
say
that
in
a
very
few
years
surprising
changes
of
opinion
would
come
these
revolutionaries
after
startling
the
more
sober
of
their
hearers
went
quietly
home
to
mother
or
landlady
supped
on
cheese
and
cocoa
and
next
day
plied
the
cleric
pen
with
exemplary
zeal
samuel
believed
himself
in
love
that
he
should
conceive
matrimonial
intentions
with
regard
to
stephen
lord
s
daughter
was
but
the
natural
issue
of
circumstance
from
that
conception
resulted
an
amorous
mood
so
much
inflamed
by
nancy
s
presence
that
a
young
man
whose
thoughts
did
not
often
transgress
decorum
had
every
reason
to
suppose
himself
her
victim
when
nancy
rejected
his
formal
offer
of
devotion
the
desire
to
wed
her
besieged
him
more
vigorously
samuel
was
piqued
at
the
tone
of
lofty
trifling
in
which
the
girl
answered
his
proposal
for
assuredly
he
esteemed
himself
no
less
remarkable
a
person
than
he
appeared
in
the
eyes
of
his
sisters
and
his
vanity
had
been
encouraged
by
lord
s
favour
of
his
qualities
as
a
man
of
business
there
was
no
doubt
in
one
direction
or
another
he
would
have
struck
the
road
to
fortune
why
nancy
should
regard
him
with
condescension
and
make
him
feel
at
once
that
his
suit
was
hopeless
puzzled
him
for
many
a
day
he
tried
flattery
affecting
to
regard
her
as
his
superior
in
things
of
the
intellect
but
only
with
the
mortifying
result
that
miss
lord
accepted
his
humility
as
quite
natural
then
he
held
apart
in
dignified
reserve
and
found
no
difficulty
in
maintaining
this
attitude
until
after
lord
s
death
of
course
he
did
not
let
his
relatives
know
of
the
repulse
he
had
suffered
but
when
speaking
to
them
of
what
had
happened
on
jubilee
night
he
made
it
appear
that
his
estimate
of
miss
lord
was
undergoing
modification
she
has
lost
him
all
through
her
flightiness
said
the
sisters
to
each
other
they
were
not
sorry
and
felt
free
again
to
criticise
nancy
s
ideas
of
maidenly
modesty
the
provisions
of
lord
s
will
could
not
but
trouble
the
intercourse
between
grove
lane
and
dagmar
road
barmby
senior
undertook
with
characteristic
seriousness
the
guardianship
conferred
upon
him
he
had
long
interviews
with
horace
and
nancy
in
which
he
acquitted
himself
greatly
to
his
own
satisfaction
samuel
equally
a
trustee
showed
his
delicacy
by
holding
aloof
save
when
civility
dictated
a
call
upon
the
young
people
but
his
hopes
had
revived
he
was
quite
willing
to
wait
three
years
for
nancy
and
it
seemed
to
him
more
than
probable
that
this
period
of
reflection
would
bring
the
young
lady
to
a
sense
of
his
merits
in
the
meantime
he
would
pursue
with
energy
the
business
now
at
his
sole
direction
and
make
it
far
more
lucrative
than
when
managed
on
lord
s
principles
as
the
weeks
went
on
it
seemed
more
clear
than
at
first
that
nancy
resented
the
authority
held
by
samuel
and
his
father
they
were
not
welcome
at
the
house
in
grove
lane
the
miss
barmbys
called
several
times
without
being
admitted
though
they
felt
sure
that
nancy
was
at
home
under
these
circumstances
it
became
desirable
to
discover
some
intermediary
who
would
keep
them
acquainted
with
the
details
of
nancy
s
life
and
of
her
brother
s
such
intermediary
was
at
hand
in
the
person
of
miss
jessica
morgan
chapter
until
of
late
there
had
existed
a
bare
acquaintance
between
jessica
and
the
barmby
family
the
two
or
three
hours
which
she
perforce
spent
in
samuel
s
company
on
jubilee
night
caused
jessica
no
little
embarrassment
as
a
natural
result
their
meetings
after
that
had
a
colour
of
intimacy
and
it
was
not
long
before
miss
morgan
and
the
miss
barmbys
began
to
see
more
of
each
other
nancy
on
a
motive
correspondent
with
that
which
actuated
her
guardians
desired
jessica
s
familiarity
with
the
household
in
dagmar
road
her
friend
could
thus
learn
and
communicate
sundry
facts
of
importance
else
hidden
from
her
in
the
retirement
to
which
she
was
now
condemned
how
did
the
barmbys
regard
her
behaviour
to
them
did
they
in
their
questioning
betray
any
suspicion
fraught
with
danger
jessica
enjoying
the
possession
of
a
most
important
secret
which
she
had
religiously
guarded
even
from
her
mother
made
time
to
accept
the
barmbys
invitations
pretty
frequently
and
invited
the
girls
to
her
own
home
as
often
as
she
could
afford
a
little
outlay
on
cakes
and
preserves
it
made
a
salutary
distraction
in
her
life
as
december
drew
near
she
exhibited
alarming
symptoms
of
and
but
for
the
romance
which
assured
to
her
an
occasional
hour
of
idleness
she
must
have
collapsed
before
the
date
of
her
examination
as
it
was
she
frightened
one
of
her
pupils
at
the
end
of
a
long
lesson
by
falling
to
the
floor
and
lying
there
for
ten
minutes
in
unconsciousness
the
warning
passed
unheeded
day
and
night
she
toiled
at
her
insuperable
tasks
at
times
half
frenzied
by
the
strangest
lapses
of
memory
and
feeling
the
more
she
laboured
only
the
more
convinced
that
at
the
last
moment
every
fact
she
had
acquired
would
ruthlessly
desert
her
her
place
of
abode

neither
health
nor
mental
tranquillity

of
the
family
held
it
a
matter
of
course
that
jessica
would
succeed
in
the
examination
it
seemed
probable
that
she
would
have
a
place
in
honours
and
meanwhile
the
poor
girl
herself
was
repenting
of
the
indiscreet
boastfulness
with
which
she
had
made
known
her
purpose
to
come
out
in
an
inferior
class
would
be
painful
enough
how
support
the
possibility
of
absolute
failure
yet
she
knew
only
too
well
that
in
certain
subjects
she
was
worse
than
shaky
her
greek
her
chemistry
her
algebra
by
way
of
propitiating
the
stern
fates
she
began
to
talk
with
lucy
and
amelia
barmby
in
a
tone
of
diffidence
half
a
year
ago
she
would
have
held
her
head
very
high
in
such
company
now
the
simple
goodness
of
the
girls
made
an
appeal
to
her
aching
heart
and
their
homely
talk
soothed
her
exhausted
brain
it
s
fearfully
difficult
she
said
to
them
one
evening
as
she
sat
in
their
parlour
and
i
lose
so
much
time
with
my
pupils
really
you
know
i
haven
t
a
fair
chance
i
was
showing
nancy
lord
the
algebra
paper
set
last
summer
and
she
confessed
she
could
hardly
do
a
single
she
couldn
t
exclaimed
one
of
the
sisters
in
astonishment
but
we
always
thought
she
was
so
very
so
she
is
in
many
things
but
she
never
dreamt
of
going
in
for
such
an
examination
as
and
do
you
really
know
more
than
she
does
jessica
smiled
with
affected
modesty
oh
i
have
studied
so
much
it
was
sweet
to
gain
this
triumph
over
her
friend
whose
progress
in
the
school
of
life
she
watched
with
the
jealousy
of
a
girl
condemned
to
sterile
passions
their
talk
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
samuel
barmby
and
his
elder
sister
addressing
him
without
reflection
said
wonderingly
sam
did
you
know
that
nancy
lord
couldn
t
pass
the
examination
that
miss
morgan
is
going
in
for
jessica
blushed
and
hastened
to
extenuate
this
crude
statement
oh
i
didn
t
say
that
only
that
she
would
have
to
study
very
hard
if
she
went
in
for
the
of
course
she
would
samuel
assented
largely
as
he
took
his
stand
before
the
fireplace
and
beamed
upon
the
female
trio
miss
lord
goes
in
for
broad
culture
that
s
quite
a
different
thing
from
studying
for
to
the
hearers
jessica
not
excepted
this
seemed
to
argue
the
spirit
of
broad
culture
in
samuel
himself
miss
morgan
pursued
nervously
examinations
are
nothing
i
believe
very
stupid
people
often
do
well
in
them
and
clever
people
often
her
voice
sank
on
the
last
word
and
she
tried
to
read
barmby
s
face
without
meeting
his
look
of
late
a
change
had
come
about
in
her
estimation
of
samuel
formerly
she
spoke
of
him
with
contemptuous
amusement
in
the
tone
set
by
nancy
since
she
had
become
a
friend
of
the
family
his
sisters
profound
respect
had
influenced
her
way
of
thinking
and
in
secret
she
was
disposed
rather
to
admire
the
he
had
always
struck
her
as
a
comely
man
and
her
education
notwithstanding
she
never
perceived
in
his
remarks
that
downright
imbecility
which
excited
nancy
s
derision
on
jubilee
night
he
was
anything
but
a
tedious
companion
apart
from
her
critical
friend
jessica
had
listened
without
impatience
to
his
jests
his
instructive
facts
his
flowing
rhetoric
in
her
enfeebled
state
of
body
and
mind
she
began
to
look
forward
with
distinct
pleasure
to
her
occasional
meetings
with
samuel
pleasure
which
perhaps
was
enhanced
by
the
air
of
condescension
wherewith
he
tempered
his
courtesy
morbid
miseries
brought
out
the
frailty
of
her
character
desiring
to
be
highly
esteemed
by
barmby
she
found
herself
no
less
willing
to
join
his
sisters
in
a
chorus
of
humbly
feminine
admiration
when
he
discoursed
to
them
from
an
altitude
at
moments
after
gazing
upon
his
eloquent
countenance
she
was
beset
by
strange
impulses
which
brought
blood
to
her
cheek
and
made
her
dread
the
miss
barmbys
scrutiny
i
look
upon
examinations
samuel
was
saying
as
a
professional
matter
i
never
went
in
for
them
myself
simply
because
i
i
turned
my
energies
in
another
you
have
passed
them
remarked
one
of
his
sisters
easily
in
miss
morgan
s
presence
he
stroked
his
chin
and
smiled
with
delicious
fatuity
i
prefer
to
say
nothing
on
that
oh
but
of
course
you
could
barmby
sounded
jessica
s
voice
in
an
unsteady
falsetto
whilst
her
eyes
were
turned
upon
the
floor
you
would
have
thought
nothing
of
this
matriculation
which
seems
to
me
so
profoundly
flattered
samuel
addressed
the
girl
in
his
suavest
tones
i
have
a
theory
miss
morgan
that
young
ladies
ought
not
to
undergo
these
ordeals
the
delicacy
of
their
nervous
system
unfits
them
for
such
a
strain
i
m
sure
we
shall
all
feel
very
glad
when
you
are
successfully
through
the
trial
after
it
you
ought
to
have
a
long

you
ought
indeed
you
ought

samuel
my

heard
from
miss

that
she
is
going
away
for
a
month
or
two

her
health

sat
silent
still
with
downcast
eyes
but
it
s
a
new
thing
isn

it
remarked
amelia
for

to

in
bad
health
she
has
suffered
a
good
deal

jessica

s
death

doctor
tells
her
she
oughtn

to
live
in
that
dull
house
through
the
in
that
case
samuel
exclaimed
of
course
she
must
go
at
once
of
course
he
never
spoke
of
nancy
but
with
stress
of
unctuous
generosity
this
if
his
hearers
knew
what
he
had
suffered
at
her
hands
must
tell
greatly
to
his
credit
if
they
were
not
aware
of
the
circumstances
such
a
tone
would

jessica
she
can
t
bear
society
so
unlike
her
isn

it
she
goes
out
very
little
indeed
sometimes
not
for
days
together
and
really
she
sees
nobody
i
m
getting
quite
anxious
about
the
subject
was
an
awkward
one
in
this
house
and
it
soon
gave
place
to
freer
conversation
on
her
way
home
though
mechanically
repeating
dates
and
formulae
jessica
could
not
resist
the
tendency
of
her
thoughts
to
dwell
on
samuel
s
features
and
samuel
s
eloquence
this
was
a
new
danger
she
had
now
little
more
than
a
fortnight
for
her
final
cram
and
any
serious
distraction
meant
ruin
in
a
day
or
two
she
took
leave
of
nancy
who
had
chosen
for
her
winter
retreat
no
less
remote
a
spot
than
falmouth
horace
having
settled
himself
in
lodgings
the
house
was
to
be
shut
up
mary
woodruff
of
course
went
down
into
cornwall
nancy
had
written
a
letter
to
barmby
senior
excusing
herself
for
not
being
able
to
see
him
before
her
departure
it
was
an
amiable
letter
but
contained
frank
avowal
of
pain
and
discontent
at
the
prospect
of
her
long
pupilage
of
course
i
submit
to
the
burden
my
father
chose
to
lay
upon
me
and
before
long
i
hope
i
shall
be
able
to
take
things
in
a
better
spirit
all
i
ask
of
you
dear
barmby
is
to
have
forbearance
with
me
until
i
get
back
my
health
and
feel
more
cheerful
you
know
that
i
could
not
be
in
better
hands
whilst
mary
is
with
me
i
shall
write
frequently
and
give
you
an
account
of
myself
let
me
hear
sometimes
and
show
me
that
you
make
allowance
for
my
very
trying
jessica
heard
the
letter
discussed
by
its
recipient
and
his
family
samuel
spoke
with
his
wonted
magnanimity
his
father
took
a
liberal
view
of
the
matter
and
in
writing
to
her
friend
a
few
days
later
jessica
was
able
to
say
i
think
you
may
safely
stay
at
falmouth
for
the
whole
winter
you
will
not
be
interfered
with
if
you
write
nicely
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
they
would
let
you
keep
out
of
their
reach
long
as
it
is
the
week
of
jessica
s
ordeal
was
now
at
hand
she
had
had
another
her
sleep
was
broken
every
night
with
hideous
dreams
she
ate
scarce
enough
to
keep
herself
alive
a
perpetual
fever
parched
her
throat
and
burned
at
her
temples
on
the
last
day
of
cram
she
sat
from
morning
to
night
in
her
comfortless
little
bedroom
bending
over
the
smoky
fire
reading
desperately
through
a
pile
of
the
motive
of
vanity
no
longer
supported
her
gladly
she
would
have
crept
away
into
a
life
of
insignificance
but
the
fee
for
the
examination
was
paid
and
she
must
face
the
terrors
the
shame
that
waited
her
at
burlington
house
no
hope
of
perhaps
at
the
last
moment
a
stroke
of
mortal
illness
would
come
to
her
relief
not
so
she
found
herself
in
the
ghastly
at
a
desk
on
which
lay
sheets
of
paper
not
whiter
than
her
face
somebody
gave
her
a
scroll
stereotyped
in
imitation
of
manuscript
the
questions
to
be
answered
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
could
not
understand
a
word
she
saw
the
face
of
samuel
barmby
and
heard
his
tones
the
delicacy
of
a
young
lady
s
nervous
system
unfits
her
for
such
a
that
evening
she
went
home
with
a
intention
of
poisoning
herself
but
the
morrow
saw
her
seated
again
before
another
scroll
of
stereotype
still
thinking
of
samuel
barmby
still
hearing
his
voice
the
man
was
grown
hateful
to
her
he
seemed
to
haunt
her
brain
malignantly
and
to
paralyse
her
hand
day
after
day
in
the
room
of
torture
until
all
was
done
then
upon
her
long
despair
followed
a
wild
unreasoning
hope
though
it
rained
she
walked
all
the
way
home
singing
chattering
to
herself
and
reached
the
without
consciousness
of
the
distance
she
had
traversed
her
mother
and
sister
came
out
into
the
hall
they
had
been
watching
for
her
i
did
a
good
paper
i

i
ve
passed
after
all
yes
i

i
ve

you
look
dreadful

morgan
and
you
re
wet
through
i

she
sat
down
to
a
meal
but
could
not
swallow
i
feel
sure
i
ve
passed
i
feel
sure
and
she
fell
from
the
chair
to
all
appearances
they
took
her
upstairs
undressed
her
sent
for
the
doctor
when
he
came
she
had
been
lying
for
conscious
but
mute
she
looked
gravely
at
him
and
said
as
if
repeating
a
lesson
the
delicacy
of
a
young
lady
s
nervous
system
unfits
her
for
such
a
undoubtedly
repeated
the
doctor
with
equal
gravity
but
she
added
eagerly

barmby
know
at
once
that

shall
know

once

the
doctor
chapter
a
lady
who
lived
at
kilburn
and
entertained
largely
in
a
house
not
designed
for
large
entertainment
was
at
home
this
evening
at
eleven
o
clock
the
two
contained
as
many
people
as
could
sit
and
stand
with
semblance
of
comfort
around
the
hostess
on
the
landing
pressed
a
crowd
which
grew
constantly
thicker
by
affluence
from
the
staircase
in
the
hall
below
a
hungarian
band
discoursed
very
loud
music
among
recent
arrivals
appeared
a
troupe
of
nigger
minstrels
engaged
to
give
their
exhilarating
entertainment
if
space
could
be
found
for
them
bursts
of
laughter
from
the
announced
the
success
of
an
american
joker
who
in
return
for
a
substantial
cheque
provided
amusement
in
fashionable
gatherings
a
brilliant
scene
the
air
which
encouraged
perspiration
was
rich
with
many
odours
voices
endeavouring
to
make
themselves
audible
in
colloquy
swelled
to
a
tumultuous
volume
that
vied
with
the
hungarian
clangours
in
a
corner
of
the
staircase
squeezed
behind
two
very
fat
women
in
very
low
dresses
stood
horace
lord
his
heated
countenance
wore
a
look
of
fretful
impatience
he
kept
rising
upon
his
toes
in
an
endeavour
to
distinguish
faces
down
in
the
hall
at
length
his
expression
changed
and
with
eager
eyes
he
began
to
force
a
way
for
himself
between
the
fat
women
not
unrewarded
with
glaring
glances
and
even
with
severe
remarks
he
succeeded
in
gaining
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
came
within
reach
of
the
persons
for
whom
he
had
been
waiting
these
were
damerel
and
fanny
french
the
elder
lady
exhibited
a
toilet
of
opulence
corresponding
with
her
mature
charms
the
younger
as
became
a
wore
graceful
white
symbol
of
her
maiden
modesty
you
promised
to
be
early
said
horace
addressing
damerel
but
regarding
fanny
who
stood
in
conversation
with
a
florid
man
of
uncertain
age
couldn
t
get
here
before
my
dear
surely
you
haven
t
brought
that
fellow
with
you
hush
you
mustn
t
talk
in
that
way
we
met
at
the
door
dane
knows
him
what
does
it
matter
horace
moved
aside
to
fanny
flushed
with
excitement
her
hair
adorned
with
flowers
she
looked
very
pretty
come
along
he
said
gripping
her
hand
more
violently
than
he
intended
let
us
get
oh
you
hurt
me
don
t
be
so
the
man
beside
her
gave
horace
a
friendly
nod
his
name
was
mankelow
horace
had
met
him
once
or
twice
of
late
at
damerel
s
but
did
not
like
him
and
felt
still
less
disposed
to
do
so
now
that
mankelow
was
acquainted
with
fanny
french
he
suspected
that
the
two
were
more
familiar
than
fanny
pretended
with
little
ceremony
he
interposed
himself
between
the
girl
and
this
possible
rival
why
didn
t
you
make
her
come
earlier
he
said
to
fanny
as
they
began
a
slow
upward
struggle
in
the
rear
of
damerel
it
isn
t
fashionable
to
come
nonsense
look
at
the
people
here
fanny
threw
up
her
chin
and
glanced
back
to
see
that
mankelow
was
following
in
his
vexation
horace
was
seized
with
a
cough
a
cough
several
times
repeated
before
he
could
check
it
your
cold
s
no
better
said
fanny
you
oughtn
t
to
have
come
out
at
it
better
he
replied
sharply
that
s
the
first
time
i
ve
coughed
do
you
mean
you
would
rather
not
have
found
me
here
how
silly
you
are
people
will
hear
what
you
re
it
was
fanny
s
first
season
but
not
her
first
at
damerel
seemed
to
be
taking
an
affectionate
interest
in
her
and
had
introduced
her
to
several
people
horace
gratified
in
the
beginning
now
suffered
from
jealousy
it
tortured
him
to
observe
fanny
when
she
talked
with
men
that
her
breeding
was
defective
mattered
nothing
in
this
composite
world
of
young
lord
who
did
not
lack
native
intelligence
understood
by
this
time
that
damerel
and
her
friends
were
far
from
belonging
to
a
high
order
of
society
he
saw
vulgarity
rampant
in
every
to
which
he
was
admitted
and
occasionally
heard
things
which
startled
his
suburban
prejudices
but
fanny
in
her
wild
enjoyment
of
these
novel
splendours
appeared
to
lose
all
she
flirted
outrageously
and
before
his
very
eyes
if
he
reproached
her
she
laughed
at
him
if
he
threatened
to
free
himself
she
returned
a
look
which
impudently
bade
him
try
horace
had
all
her
faults
by
heart
and
no
longer
tried
to
think
that
he
respected
her
or
that
if
he
married
such
a
girl
his
life
could
possibly
be
a
happy
one
but
she
still
played
upon
his
passions
and
at
her
beck
he
followed
like
a
dog
the
hostess
dane
a
woman
who
looked
as
if
she
had
once
been
superior
to
the
kind
of
life
she
now
led
welcomed
him
with
peculiar
warmth
and
in
a
quick
confidential
voice
bade
him
keep
near
her
for
a
few
minutes
there
s
some
one
i
want
to
introduce
you
to
some
one
i
m
sure
you
will
like
to
obeying
her
he
soon
lost
sight
of
fanny
but
dane
continued
to
talk
at
intervals
in
such
a
flattering
tone
that
his
turbid
emotions
were
soothed
he
had
heard
of
the
chittles
no
they
were
very
old
friends
of
hers
said
dane
and
she
particularly
wanted
him
to
know
them
ah
here
they
came
mother
and
daughter
horace
observed
them
chittle
was
a
frail
worn
nervous
woman
who
must
once
have
been
comely
her
daughter
a
girl
of
had
a
pale
thin
face
of
much
sweetness
and
gentleness
they
seemed
by
no
means
at
home
in
this
company
but
chittle
when
she
conversed
assumed
a
vivacious
air
the
daughter
trying
to
follow
her
example
strove
vainly
against
an
excessive
bashfulness
and
seldom
raised
her
eyes
why
he
should
be
expected
to
pay
special
attention
to
these
people
horace
was
at
a
loss
to
understand
but
chittle
attached
herself
to
him
and
soon
led
him
into
familiar
dialogue
he
learnt
from
her
that
they
had
lived
for
two
or
three
years
in
a
very
quiet
country
place
they
had
come
up
for
the
season
but
did
not
know
many
people
she
spoke
of
her
daughter
who
stood
just
out
of
earshot
her
eyes
cast
down
on
her
face
a
sad
fixed
smile
and
said
that
it
had
been
necessary
almost
to
force
her
into
society
she
loves
the
country
and
is
so
fond
of
books
but
at
her
age
it
s
really
a
shame
to
live
like
a
nun
don
t
you
think
so
lord
decidedly
it
was
said
horace
i
m
doing
my
best
pursued
chittle
to
cure
her
of
her
shyness
she
is
really
afraid
of
people
and
it
s
such
a
pity
she
says
that
the
things
people
talk
about
don
t
interest
her
but
people
are
not
frivolous
are
they
lord
horace
hoped
not
and
presently
out
of
mere
he
tried
to
converse
with
the
young
lady
in
a
way
that
should
neither
alarm
her
shyness
nor
prove
distasteful
to
her
intelligence
but
with
very
little
success
from
time
to
time
the
girl
glanced
at
him
with
strange
timidity
yet
seemed
quite
willing
to
listen
as
long
as
he
chose
to
talk
fanny
being
at
a
considerable
distance
from
home
was
to
return
to
the
where
her
chaperon
now
lived
and
have
a
room
there
for
the
night
horace
disliked
this
arrangement
for
the
objectionable
mankelow
lived
in
the
same
house
when
he
was
able
to
get
speech
with
fanny
he
tried
to
persuade
her
to
go
with
him
all
the
way
home
to
camberwell
in
a
cab
miss
french
would
not
listen
to
the
suggestion
who
ever
heard
of
such
a
thing
it
wouldn
t
be
proper
oh
i
like
that
he
replied
with
scathing
irony
you
can
either
like
it
or
not
damerel
wouldn
t
dream
of
allowing
it
i
think
she
s
quite
as
good
a
judge
of
propriety
as
you
they
were
in
a
corner
of
the
fanny
having
supped
much
to
her
satisfaction
had
a
high
colour
and
treated
her
lover
with
more
than
usual
insolence
horace
had
eaten
little
but
had
not
refrained
from
beverages
he
was
disposed
to
assert
himself
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
have
an
understanding
you
never
do
as
i
wish
in
a
single
thing
what
do
you
mean
by
it
oh
if
you
re
going
to
be
nasty
she
made
the
gesture
of
a
who
quarrels
with
her
young
man
at
the
i
can
t
stand
the
kind
of
treatment
you
ve
given
me
lately
said
horace
with
muffled
anger
i
ve
told
you
i
shall
do
just
as
i
very
well
that
s
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
care
nothing
about
me
i
m
not
going
to
be
the
slave
of
a
girl
who
has
no
sense
of
honour
not
even
of
decency
if
you
wish
me
to
speak
to
you
again
you
must
speak
and
he
left
her
fanny
laughing
scornfully
it
drew
towards
one
o
clock
when
having
exhausted
the
delights
of
the
evening
and
being
in
a
decidedly
limp
condition
damerel
and
her
protegee
drove
home
fanny
said
nothing
of
what
had
passed
between
her
and
horace
the
elder
lady
after
keeping
silence
for
half
the
drive
spoke
at
length
in
a
tone
of
indulgent
playfulness
so
you
talked
a
good
deal
with
mankelow
not
for
long
now
and
then
he
took
me
down
to
supper
the
first
i
m
afraid
somebody
will
be
a
little
jealous
i
shall
get
into
trouble
i
didn
t
foresee
somebody
must
treat
me
in
a
reasonable
way
fanny
answered
with
a
dry
laugh
i
m
quite
sure
he
will
said
damerel
suavely
but
i
feel
myself
a
little
responsible
you
know
let
me
put
you
on
your
guard
against
mankelow
i
m
afraid
he
s
rather
a
dangerous
man
i
have
heard
rather
alarming
stories
about
him
you
see
he
s
very
rich
and
very
rich
men
if
they
re
rather
handsome
as
well
say
and
do
things
you
understand
is
he
really
very
rich
well
several
thousands
a
year
and
a
prospect
of
more
when
relatives
die
i
don
t
mean
to
say
that
he
is
a
bad
man
he
belongs
to
a
very
good
family
and
i
believe
him
perfectly
honourable
he
would
never
do
any
one
any
harm
or
if
he
happened
to
without
meaning
it
i
m
quite
sure
he
d
repair
it
in
the
honourable
you
said
he
was
dangerous
to
a
young
lady
who
is
already
engaged
confess
that
you
think
him
rather
having
inflamed
the
girl
s
imagination
damerel
presently
dropped
the
subject
and
fell
again
into
weary
silence
at
noon
of
the
next
day
she
received
a
call
from
horace
who
found
her
over
tea
and
toast
in
her
private
the
young
man
looked
bilious
he
coughed
too
and
said
that
he
must
have
caught
fresh
cold
last
night
that
house
was
like
an
oven
i
won
t
go
to
any
more
such
places
that
isn
t
my
idea
of
enjoying
damerel
examined
him
with
affectionate
solicitude
and
reflected
before
speaking
haven
t
you
been
living
rather
fast
lately
he
avoided
her
eyes
not
at
quite
sure
how
much
money
have
you
spent
this
last
month
not
by
careful
interrogation
the
caressing
notes
of
her
voice
seemed
to
convey
genuine
feeling
damerel
elicited
the
fact
that
he
had
spent
not
less
than
fifty
pounds
in
a
few
weeks
she
looked
very
grave
what
would
our
little
fanny
say
to
this
i
don
t
care
what
she
would
and
he
unburdened
himself
of
his
complaints
against
the
frivolous
charmer
damerel
listening
with
a
compassionate
smile
i
m
afraid
it
s
all
too
true
dear
boy
but
didn
t
i
warn
you
you
have
made
her
worse
and
i
more
than
half
believe
you
have
purposely
put
her
in
the
way
of
that
fellow
mankelow
now
i
tell
you
plainly
his
voice
quivered
if
i
lose
her
i
ll
raise
all
the
money
i
can
and
play
the
very
hush
no
naughty
words
let
us
talk
about
something
else
till
you
are
what
did
you
think
of
chittle
i
thought
nothing
of
her
good
or
of
her
daughter
then
isn
t
she
a
sweet
quiet
girl
do
you
know
that
she
is
rich
it
s
perfectly
true
chittle
is
the
widow
of
a
man
who
made
a
big
fortune
out
of
a
kind
of
imitation
velvet
it
sold
only
for
a
few
years
then
something
else
drove
it
out
of
the
market
but
the
money
was
made
i
know
all
about
it
from
it
s
nothing
to
me
said
horace
peevishly
but
damerel
continued
the
poor
girl
has
been
very
unfortunate
in
the
last
year
of
her
father
s
life
they
lived
in
good
style
and
and
she
fell
in
love
with
somebody
who
who
treated
her
badly
broke
it
off
in
fact
just
before
the
wedding
she
had
a
bad
illness
and
since
then
she
has
lived
as
her
mother
told
how
do
you
know
she
told
me
i
oh
i
took
it
for
granted
she
said
you
had
had
a
long
talk
you
can
see
of
course
that
they
re
not
ordinary
people
didn
t
winifred
her
name
is
winifred
strike
you
as
very
refined
and
she
hardly
spoke
that
s
her
nervousness
she
has
quite
got
out
of
the
habit
of
society
but
she
s
very
clever
and
so
good
i
want
you
to
see
more
of
her
if
she
comes
here
to
tea
will
you
just
to
please
me
look
in
for
she
bent
her
head
aside
wistfully
horace
vouchsafed
no
reply
dear
boy
i
know
very
well
what
a
disappointment
you
are
suffering
why
not
be
quite
open
with
me
though
i
m
only
a
tiresome
old
aunt
i
feel
every
bit
as
anxious
for
your
happiness
as
if
i
were
your
mother
i
do
indeed
horace
you
believe
me
don
t
you
you
have
been
very
kind
in
many
ways
but
you
ve
done
harm
to
fanny
no
harm
whatever
horace
believe
me
i
have
only
given
her
an
opportunity
of
showing
what
she
really
is
you
see
now
that
she
thinks
of
nothing
at
all
but
money
and
selfish
pleasures
compare
her
my
dear
with
such
a
girl
as
winifred
chittle
i
only
mean
just
to
show
you
the
difference
between
a
lady
and
such
a
girl
as
fanny
she
has
treated
you
abominably
my
poor
boy
and
what
would
she
bring
you
not
that
i
wish
you
to
marry
for
money
i
have
seen
too
much
of
the
world
to
be
so
foolish
so
wicked
but
when
there
sweet
clever
girls
with
large
incomes
and
a
handsome
boy
like
you
you
may
blush
but
there
s
no
harm
in
telling
the
truth
you
are
far
too
modest
you
don
t
know
how
you
look
in
the
eyes
of
an
affectionate
thoughtful
girl
like
winifred
for
instance
it
s
dreadful
to
think
of
you
throwing
yourself
away
my
dear
it
may
sound
shocking
to
you
but
fanny
french
isn
t
the
sort
of
girl
that
men
horace
showed
himself
startled
you
are
so
young
pursued
the
mature
lady
with
an
indulgent
smile
you
need
the
advice
of
some
one
who
knows
the
world
in
years
to
come
you
will
feel
very
grateful
to
me
now
don
t
let
us
talk
any
more
of
that
just
now
but
tell
me
something
about
nancy
how
much
longer
does
she
mean
to
stay
in
cornwall
he
answered
absently
she
talks
of
another
month
or
but
what
have
her
guardians
to
say
to
that
why
she
has
been
away
for
nearly
half
a
year
how
can
that
be
called
living
at
the
old
house
it
s
no
business
of
nor
of
mine
you
mean
to
say
still
it
does
seem
rather
strange
i
suppose
she
is
quite
to
be
trusted
trusted
what
harm
can
come
to
her
she
s
keeping
out
of
sam
barmby
s
way
that
s
all
i
believe
he
plagued
her
to
marry
him
a
nice
husband
for
nancy
i
wish
we
had
taken
to
each
other
said
damerel
musingly
i
think
she
was
a
little
jealous
of
the
attention
i
had
paid
to
but
perhaps
we
shall
do
better
some
day
and
i
m
quite
content
so
long
as
care
a
little
for
me
dear
boy
you
ll
never
give
me
up
will
you
it
was
asked
with
unusual
show
of
feeling
she
leaned
forward
her
eyes
fixed
tenderly
upon
the
boy
s
face
you
would
never
let
a
fanny
french
come
between
us
horace
dear
i
only
wish
you
hadn
t
brought
her
among
your
some
day
you
will
be
glad
of
what
i
did
whatever
happens
i
am
your
best
friend
the
best
and
truest
friend
you
will
ever
have
you
will
know
it
some
the
voice
impressed
horace
its
emotion
was
so
true
several
times
through
the
day
he
recalled
and
thought
of
it
as
yet
he
had
felt
nothing
like
affection
for
damerel
but
before
their
next
meeting
an
impulse
he
did
not
try
to
account
for
caused
him
to
write
her
a
letter
simply
to
assure
her
that
he
was
not
ungrateful
for
her
kindness
the
reply
that
came
in
a
few
hours
surprised
and
touched
him
for
it
repeated
in
yet
warmer
words
all
she
had
spoken
let
me
be
in
the
place
of
a
mother
to
you
dear
horace
think
of
me
as
if
i
were
your
mother
if
i
were
your
mother
indeed
i
could
not
love
you
he
mused
over
this
and
received
from
it
a
sense
of
comfort
which
was
quite
new
to
him
all
through
the
winter
he
had
been
living
as
a
gentleman
of
assured
independence
this
was
managed
very
simply
acting
on
damerel
s
counsel
he
insured
his
life
and
straightaway
used
the
policy
as
security
for
a
loan
of
five
hundred
pounds
from
a
friend
of
damerel
s
the
insurance
itself
was
not
effected
without
a
disagreeable
little
episode
as
a
result
of
the
medical
examination
horace
learnt
greatly
to
his
surprise
that
he
would
have
to
pay
a
premium
somewhat
higher
than
the
ordinary
unpleasant
questions
were
asked
was
he
quite
sure
that
he
knew
of
no
case
of
consumption
in
his
family
quite
sure
he
answered
stoutly
and
sincerely
why
did
the
doctor
think
consumptive
oh
dear
no
but
a
slight
constitutional
weakness
in
fine
the
higher
premium
must
be
exacted
he
paid
it
with
the
indifference
of
his
years
but
said
nothing
to
damerel
and
thereupon
began
the
sowing
of
wild
oats
at
after
domestic
restraint
and
occupations
that
he
detested
he
was
let
loose
upon
life
five
hundred
pounds
seemed
to
him
practically
inexhaustible
he
did
not
wish
to
indulge
in
great
extravagance
merely
to
see
and
to
taste
the
world
ah
the
rapture
of
those
first
nights
when
he
revelled
amid
the
tumult
of
london
pursuing
joy
with
a
pocket
full
of
sovereigns
theatres
restaurants
and
he
had
seen
so
little
of
these
things
that
they
excited
him
as
they
do
a
lad
fresh
from
the
country
he
drew
the
line
nowhere
love
of
a
worthy
woman
tells
for
chastity
even
in
the
young
and
the
sensual
love
of
a
fanny
french
merely
debauches
the
mind
and
inflames
the
passions
secure
in
his
paganism
horace
followed
where
the
lures
of
london
beckoned
him
he
knew
not
reproach
of
conscience
shame
offered
but
thin
resistance
to
his
boiling
blood
by
a
miracle
he
had
as
yet
escaped
worse
damage
to
health
than
a
severe
cold
caught
one
night
after
heroic
drinking
that
laid
him
by
the
heels
for
a
time
and
the
cough
still
clung
to
him
in
less
than
two
years
he
would
command
seven
thousand
pounds
and
a
share
in
the
business
now
conducted
by
samuel
barmby
what
need
to
stint
himself
whilst
he
felt
able
to
enjoy
life
if
fanny
deceived
him
were
there
not
after
all
other
and
better
fannys
to
be
won
by
his
money
for
it
was
a
result
of
this
girl
s
worthlessness
that
horace
in
most
things
so
ingenuous
had
come
to
regard
women
with
unconscious
cynicism
he
did
not
think
he
could
be
loved
for
his
own
sake
but
he
believed
that
at
any
time
the
show
of
love
perhaps
its
ultimate
sincerity
might
be
won
by
display
of
cash
midway
in
the
month
of
may
he
again
caught
a
severe
cold
and
was
confined
to
the
house
for
nearly
three
weeks
damerel
who
nursed
him
well
and
tenderly
proposed
that
he
should
go
down
for
change
of
air
to
falmouth
he
wrote
to
nancy
asking
whether
she
would
care
to
see
him
a
prompt
reply
informed
him
that
his
sister
was
on
the
point
of
returning
to
london
so
that
he
had
better
choose
some
nearer
seaside
resort
he
went
to
hastings
for
a
few
days
but
wearied
of
the
place
and
came
back
to
his
london
excitements
nancy
however
had
not
yet
returned
nor
did
she
until
the
beginning
of
july
chapter
this
winter
saw
the
establishment
of
the
south
london
fashionable
dress
supply
association
the
name
finally
selected
by
beatrice
french
and
her
advisers
it
was
an
undertaking
shrewdly
conceived
skilfully
planned
and
energetically
set
going
beatrice
knew
the
public
to
which
her

the

was

a

shop
with
the
new
and
attractive
appendages
which
crewe
and
beatrice
had
visioned
in
their
prophetic
minds
before
the
close
of
the
year
substantial
business
had
been
done
and
opened
with
exhilarating
prospects
the
ineptitude
of
uneducated
english
women
in
all
that
relates
to
their
attire
is
a
fact
that
it
boots
not
to
enlarge
upon
beatrice
french
could
not
be
regarded
as
an
exception
for
though
she
recognised
monstrosities
she
very
reasonably
distrusted
her
own
taste
in
the
choice
of
a
garment
for
her
sisters
monstrosities
had
a
distinct
charm
and
to
this
class
of
women
belonged
all
customers
of
the
association
who
pretended
to
think
for
themselves
as
to
wherewithal
they
should
be
clothed
but
women
in
general
came
to
the
shop
with
confessed
blankness
of
mind
beyond
the
desire
to
buy
something
that
was
modish
and
to
pay
for
it
in
a
minus
quantity
they
knew
felt
thought
nothing
whatever
green
or
violet
cerulean
or
magenta
all
was
one
to
them
in
the
matter
of
shape
they
sought
merely
a
confident
assurance
from
articulate
man
or
woman
themselves
being
somewhat
less
articulate
than
jay
or
jackdaw
that
this
or
that
was
the
feature
of
the
they
could
not
distinguish
between
a
becoming
garment
and
one
that
called
for
the
consuming
fires
of
heaven
it
is
often
assumed
as
a
commonplace
that
women
whatever
else
they
can
not
do
may
be
trusted
to
make
up
their
minds
about
habiliments
nothing
more
false
as
beatrice
french
was
abundantly
aware
a
very
large
proportion
of
the
females
in
brixton
camberwell
and
peckham
could
not
with
any
confidence
buy
a
chemise
or
a
pair
of
stockings
and
when
it
came
to
garments
visible
they
were
lost
indeed
fanny
french
began
to
regret
that
she
had
not
realised
her
capital
and
put
it
into
the
association
wishing
at
length
to
do
so
she
met
with
a
scornful
rebuff
beatrice
would
have
none
of
her
money
but
told
her
she
might
use
the
shop
like
any
other
customer
which
of
course
fanny
did
peachey
meanwhile
kept
declaring
to
both
her
sisters
that
they
must
not
expect
to
live
henceforth
in
de
crespigny
park
on
the
old
nominal
terms
beatrice
was
on
the
way
to
wealth
fanny
moved
in
west
end
society
under
the
chaperonage
of
a
rich
woman
they
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
themselves
for
not
volunteering
handsome
recognition
of
the
benefits
they
had
received
beneath
their
sister
s
roof
but
neither
beatrice
nor
fanny
appeared
to
see
the
matter
in
this
light
the
truth
was
that
they
both
had
in
view
a
change
of
domicile
the
elder
desired
more
comfort
and
more
independence
than
de
crespigny
park
could
afford
her
the
younger
desired
a
great
many
things
and
flattered
herself
that
a
very
simple
step
would
put
her
in
possession
of
them
the
master
of

no
longer
took
any

he
would
not

he
would
not
bid
them
stay
least
of
all
would
he
demand
money
from
them
of
money
he
had
no
need
and
he
was
the
hapless
possessor
of
a
characteristic
not
to
be
found
in
any
other
member
of
his
household
natural
delicacy
arthur
peachey
lived
only
for
his
child
the
little
boy
whose
newly
prattling
tongue
made
the
sole
welcome
he
expected
or
cared
for
on
his
return
from
a
hard
day
s
work
happily
the
child
had
good
health
but
he
never
left
home
without
dread
of
perils
that
might
befall
it
in
his
absence
on
the
mother
he
counted
not
at
all
a
cow
might
with
more
confidence
have
been
set
to
watch
over
the
little
one
s
safety
the
emma
retained
in
spite
of
her
mistress
s
malice
still
seemed
to
discharge
her
duties
faithfully
but
being
mortal
she
demanded
intervals
of
leisure
from
time
to
time
and
at
such
seasons
as
peachey
too
well
knew
the
child
was
uncared
for
had
his
heart
been
resolute
as
it
was
tender
he
would
long
ago
have
carried
out
a
project
which
haunted
him
at
every
moment
of
anger
or
fear
in
the
town
of
canterbury
lived
a
sister
of
his
who
for
several
years
had
been
happily
wedded
but
remained
childless
if
the
worst
came
to
the
worst
if
his
wife
compelled
him
to
the
of
a
home
which
was
no
home
this
married
sister
would
gladly
take
the
little
boy
into
her
motherly
care
he
had
never
dared
to
propose
the
step
but
ada
might
perchance
give
ready
assent
to
it
even
now
for
motherhood
she
had
no
single
qualification
but
the
physical
before
her
child
s
coming
into
the
world
she
snarled
at
the
restraints
it
imposed
upon
her
at
its
birth
she
clamoured
against
nature
for
the
pains
she
had
to
undergo
and
hated
her
husband
because
he
was
the
intermediate
cause
of
them
the
helpless
infant
gave
her
no
pleasure
touched
no
emotion
in
her
heart
save
when
she
saw
it
in
the
nurse
s
care
and
received
female
compliments
upon
its
beauty
she
rejected
it
at
night
because
it
broke
her
sleep
in
the
day
because
she
could
not
handle
it
without
making
it
cry
when
peachey
remonstrated
with
her
she
stared
in
insolent
surprise
and
wished
that
had
had
to
suffer
all
her
hardships
of
the
past
year
peachey
could
not
be
said
to
have
any
leisure
on
returning
from
business
he
was
involved
forthwith
in
domestic
troubles
and
broils
which
consumed
the
dreary
evening
and
invaded
even
his
sleep
thus
it
happened
that
at
long
intervals
he
was
tempted
instead
of
going
home
to
dinner
to
spend
a
couple
of
hours
at
a
certain
small
a
resort
of
his
bachelor
days
where
he
could
read
the
newspapers
have
a
chop
in
quietude
and
afterwards
if
acquaintances
were
here
play
a
game
of
chess
of
course
he
had
to
shield
this
modest
dissipation
with
a
flat
falsehood
alleging
to
his
wife
that
business
had
kept
him
late
thus
on
an
evening
of
june
when
the
soft
air
and
the
mellow
sunlight
overcame
him
with
a
longing
for
rest
he
despatched
a
telegram
to
de
crespigny
park
and
strolled
quietly
about
the
streets
until
the
hour
and
his
appetite
pointed
him
tablewards
the
pity
of
it
was
that
he
could
not
dismiss
anxieties
he
loathed
the
coward
falsehood
and
thought
more
of
home
than
of
his
present
freedom
but
at
least
ada
s
tongue
was
silent
he
seated
himself
in
the
familiar
corner
and
turned
over
illustrated
papers
whilst
his
chop
hissed
on
the
grid
ah
if
he
were
but
unmarried
what
a
life
he
might
make
for
himself
now
that
the
day
s
labour
brought
its
ample
reward
he
would
have
rooms
in
london
and
a
still
clean
lodging
somewhere
among
the
lanes
and
fields
his
ideals
expressed
the
homeliness
of
the
man
on
intellect
he
could
not
pride
himself
his
education
had
been
but
of
the
commercial
order
he
liked
to
meditate
rather
than
to
read
questions
of
the
day
concerned
him
not
at
all
a
weak
man
but
of
clean
and
kindly
instincts
in
mercantile
life
he
had
succeeded
by
virtue
of
his
intensely
methodical
habits
the
characteristic
which
made
him
suffer
so
from
his
wife
s
indolence
incapacity
and
vicious
before
his
marriage
he
had
thought
of
women
as
domestic
beings
a
wife
was
the
genius
of
home
he
knew
men
who
thanked
their
wives
for
all
the
prosperity
and
content
that
they
enjoyed
others
he
knew
who
told
quite
a
different
tale
but
these
surely
were
sorrowful
exceptions
nowadays
he
saw
the
matter
in
a
light
of
fuller
experience
in
his
rank
of
life
married
happiness
was
a
rare
thing
and
the
fault
could
generally
be
traced
to
wives
who
had
no
sense
of
responsibility
no
understanding
of
household
duties
no
love
of
simple
pleasures
no
religion
yes
there
was
the
point
no
religion
ada
had
grown
up
to
regard
as
a
sign
of
respectability
but
without
a
shadow
of
religious
faith
her
incredible
ignorance
of
the
bible
story
of
christian
dogmas
often
amazed
him
himself
a
believer
though
careless
in
the
practice
of
forms
he
was
not
disturbed
by
the
modern
tendency
to
look
for
morals
apart
from
faith
he
had
not
the
trouble
of
reflecting
that
an
ignorant
woman
is
the
last
creature
to
be
moralised
by
anything
but
the
christian
code
he
saw
straight
into
the
fact
that
there
was
no
hope
of
impressing
ada
with
ideas
of
goodness
truthfulness
purity
simply
because
she
recognised
no
moral
authority
for
such
minds
no
moral
authority
merely
as
a
moral
authority
is
or
can
be
valid
such
natures
are
ruled
only
by
superstition
the
representative
of
reasoned
faith
in
nobler
beings
rob
them
of
their
superstition
and
they
perish
amid
all
uncleanliness
thou
shalt
not
lie
for
god
consumes
a
liar
in
the
flames
of
hell
ada
peachey
could
lend
ear
to
no
admonition
short
of
that
and
living
when
she
did
bred
as
she
was
only
a
john
knox
could
have
impressed
her
with
this
menace
to
be
forgotten
when
the
echoes
of
his
voice
had
failed
he
did
not
enjoy
his
chop
this
evening
in
the
game
of
chess
that
followed
he
played
idly
with
absent
thoughts
and
before
the
glow
of
sunset
had
died
from
the
calm
heaven
he
set
out
to
walk
homeward
anxious
melancholy
on
approaching
the
house
he
suffered
as
always
from
quickened
pulse
and
heart
constricted
with
fear
until
he
knew
that
all
was
well
he
looked
like
a
man
who
anticipates
dread
calamity
this
evening
on
opening
the
door
he
fell
back
in
the
hall
stood
a
surrounded
by
a
group
of
women
peachey
her
sisters
emma
the
and
two
other
servants
oh
here
you
are
at
last
exclaimed
his
wife
in
a
voice
exhausted
with
rage
you
re
just
in
time
to
see
this
beast
taken
off
to
the
perhaps
you
ll
believe
me
now
what
is
it
what
has
she
done
stolen
money
that
s
what
she
s
done
your
precious
emma
she
s
been
at
it
for
a
long
time
i
ve
told
you
some
one
was
robbing
me
so
i
marked
some
coins
in
my
purse
and
left
it
in
the
bedroom
whilst
we
were
at
dinner
and
then
when
i
found
gone
and
it
was
her
evening
out
too
i
sent
for
a
policeman
before
she
knew
anything
and
we
made
her
turn
out
her
pockets
and
there
s
the
perhaps
you
ll
believe
it
this
time
the
girl
s
face
declared
her
guilt
she
had
hardly
attempted
denial
then
with
a
clamour
of
furious
verbosity
ada
enlightened
her
husband
on
other
points
of
emma
s
behaviour
it
was
a
long
story
gathered
in
the
last
few
minutes
partly
from
the
culprit
herself
partly
from
her
emma
had
got
into
the
clutches
of
a
jewellery
tallyman
one
of
the
fellows
who
sell
trinkets
to
on
the
system
she
had
made
several
purchases
of
gewgaws
and
had
already
paid
three
or
four
times
their
value
but
was
still
in
debt
to
the
tallyman
who
threatened
all
manner
of
impossible
proceedings
if
she
did
not
make
up
her
arrears
bottomless
ignorance
and
imbecile
vanity
had
been
the
girl
s
ruin
aided
by
a
grave
indiscretion
on
peachey
s
part
of
which
he
was
to
hear
presently
some
one
must
go
to
the
and
make
a
formal
charge
ada
would
undertake
this
duty
with
pious
eagerness
enjoying
it
all
the
more
because
of
loud
wailings
and
entreaties
which
the
girl
now
addressed
to
her
master
peachey
looked
at
his
and
in
neither
face
perceived
a
compassionate
softening
fanny
stood
by
as
at
a
spectacle
provided
for
her
amusement
without
rancour
but
equally
without
pity
beatrice
was
contemptuous
what
right
said
her
countenance
had
a
to
covet
jewellery
and
how
pitiable
the
spirit
that
prompted
to
a
filching
of
for
the
criminals
of
finance
who
devastate
a
thousand
homes
miss
french
had
no
small
admiration
crimes
such
as
the
present
were
mean
and
dirty
ada
reappeared
hurriedly
clad
for
going
forth
but
no
one
had
fetched
a
cab
incensed
she
ordered
her
husband
to
do
so
who
are
you
speaking
to
he
replied
wrathfully
i
am
not
your
fanny
laughed
the
policeman
professionally
calm
averted
a
smiling
face
it
s
nothing
to
me
said
peachey
i

quite
willing
to
walk
come
along
her
husband
interposed
the
girl

go
from
my
house
until
she
s
properly
he
turned
to
the
other
servants
please
to
blow
the
whistle
at
the
door
or
get
a
cab
somehow
emma
go
upstairs
and
put
your
things
it
was
about
time
you
behaved
like
a
man
fell
quietly
from
beatrice
you
re
he
looked
sternly
at
the
speaker
it
time
and
that
you
shall
all
the
culprit
suddenly
silent
obeyed
his
order
the
constable
went
out
at
the
front
door
and
there
waited
whilst
a
whistle
shrilled
along
de
crespigny
park
ada
had
ascended
to
the
first
landing
to
make
sure
that
the
culprit
did
not
escape
her
beatrice
and
fanny
retired
into
the
after
a
lapse
of
some
ten
minutes
two
cabs
rattled
up
to
the
door
from
opposite
directions
each
driver
lashing
his
horse
to
gain
the
advantage
so
nearly
were
they
matched
that
with
difficulty
the
vehicles
avoided
a
collision
the
man
who
had
secured
a
place
immediately
in
front
of
the
doorsteps
waved
his
whip
and
uttered
a
shout
of
insulting
triumph
his
rival
answered
with
volleys
of
abuse
and
drove
round
as
if
meditating
an
assault
it
was
necessary
for
the
policeman
to
interfere
whereupon
the
defeated
competitor
vowed
that
it
was
sanguinary
hard
lines
that
for
the
sanguinary
whole
of
this
sanguinary
day
had
he
waited
vainly
for
a
sanguinary
fare
and
but
for
a
sanguinary
stumble
of
his
sanguinary
horse
tired
of
waiting
and
suspicious
of
the
delay
ada
went
up
to
the
room
where
the
servant
was
supposed
to
be
making
ready
it
was
a
little
room
which
served
as
by
the
girl

bed

a
cot
occupied
by
the
child
ada
exclaiming
now
come
along
opened
the
door
violently
a
candle
was
burning
the
boy
awake
but
silent
sat
up
in
his
cot
and
looked
about
with
sleepy
yet
frightened
eyes
where
are
you
emma
could
not
be
seen
astonished
and
enraged
ada
rushed
forward
she
found
the
girl
lying
on
the
floor
and
after
bending
over
her
started
back
with
a
cry
half
of
alarm
half
of
disgust
come
up
here
at
once
she
screamed
down
the
staircase
come
up
the
wretch
has
cut
her
throat
there
was
a
rush
of
feet
peachey
the
first
to
enter
saw
a
gash
on
the
neck
of
the
insensible
girl
in
her
hand
she
held
a
pair
of
scissors
i
hope
you
re
satisfied
he
said
to
his
wife
the
animated
by
a
brisk
succession
of
events
such
as
he
could
not
hope
for
every
day
raised
the
prostrate
figure
and
speedily
announced
that
the
wound
was
not
mortal
she
s
fainted
that
s
all
tried
to
do
for
herself
with
them
scissors
and
didn
t
know
the
way
to
go
about
it
we
ll
get
her
off
sharp
to
the
it
ll
be
attempted
suicide
now
as
well
as
stealing
cried
ada
terrified
by
the
crowd
of
noisy
people
the
child
began
to
cry
loudly
peachey
lifted
him
out
of
the
cot
wrapped
a
blanket
about
him
and
carried
him
down
to
his
own
bedroom
there
heedless
of
what
was
going
on
above
he
tried
to
soothe
the
little
fellow
lavishing
caresses
and
tender
words
my
little
boy
will
be
good
he
ll
wait
here
quietly
till
father
comes
back
only
a
few
minutes
and
father
will
come
back
and
sit
by
him
yes
he
shall
sleep
here
all
night
ada
burst
into
the
room
i
should
think
you
d
better
go
and
look
after
your
dear
emma
as
if
i
didn
t
know
what

been
going
on
it
s
all

out
so
you
needn
t
tell
me
any
lies

been
giving
her
money
the
other
servants
knew
of
it
she
confessed
it
herself
oh
you
re
a
nice
sort
of
man
you
are
men
of
your
sort
are
always
good
at
preaching
to
other
people
you
ve
given
her
money
what
does
mean
i
suspected
it
all
along
you
wouldn
t
have
her
sent
away
oh
no
she
was
so
good
to
the
child
and
so
good
to
somebody
else
a
dirty
servant
i
d
choose
some
one
better
than
that
if
i
was
a
man
how
much
has
she
cost
you
as
much
no
doubt
as
one
of
the
swell
women
in
piccadilly
circus
peachey
turned
upon
her
the
sweat
beading
on
his
ghastly
face
go
out
of
this
room
or
by
god
i
shall
do
something
fearful
out
she
backed
before
him
he
seized
her
by
the
shoulders
and
flung
her
forth
then
locked
the
door
from
without
she
railed
at
him
in
the
language
of
the
gutter
and
the
brothel
presently
her
shouts
were
mingled
with
piercing
shrieks
they
came
from
the
who
restored
to
consciousness
was
being
carried
down
for
removal
in
the
cab
peachey
looking
and
feeling
like
a
man
whom
passion
had
brought
within
sight
of
murder
stopped
his
ears
and
huddled
himself
against
the
bedside
the
child
screamed
in
terror
at
length
came
silence
peachey
opened
the
door
and
listened
below
voices
sounded
in
quiet
conversation
who
is
down
there
he
called
all
of
us
except
ada
replied
beatrice
the
policeman
said
she
needn
t
go
unless
she
liked
but
she
very
he
ran
up
to
the
deserted
bedroom
carefully
gathered
together
his
child
s
and
brought
them
down
then
as
well
as
he
could
he
dressed
the
boy
is
it
time
to
get
up
inquired
the
little
astonished
at
all
that
was
happening
but
soothed
and
amused
by
the
thought
that
his
father
had
turned
nurse
it
isn
t
light
you
are
going
somewhere
with
father
dear
somewhere
the
dialogue
between
them
in
sweet
broken
words
such
as
the
child
had
not
yet
outgrown
and
the
parent
did
not
wish
to
abandon
for
common
speech
went
on
until
the
dressing
was
completed
now
will
my
boy
show
me
where
his
clothes
are
for
going
out
his
cap
and
his
coat
oh
yes
they
were
up
in
the
nursery
boy
would
show
father
and
laughed
merrily
that
he
knew
something
father
didn
t
a
few
minutes
more
and
the
equipment
was
completed
now
wait
for
me
here
only
a
minute
my
boy
won
t
cry
if
i
leave
him
for
a
minute
cry
of
course
not
peachey
descended
to
the
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
stood
facing
his
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
am
going
away
and
taking
the
child
with
me
ada
needn
t
expect
me
back
nor
ever
as
long
as
i
live
i
will
never
again
be
under
the
same
roof
with
her
you
beatrice
said
it
was
about
time
i
behaved
like
a
man
you
were
right
i
ve
put
up
long
enough
with
things
such
as
no
man
ought
to
endure
for
a
day
tell
your
sister
that
she
may
go
on
living
here
if
she
chooses
for
another
six
months
to
the
end
of
the
year
not
longer
she
shall
be
supplied
with
sufficient
money
after
christmas
she
may
find
a
home
for
herself
where
she
likes
money
will
be
paid
to
her
through
a
lawyer
but
from
this
day
i
will
neither
speak
nor
write
to
her
you
two
must
make
your
own
arrangements
you
have
means
enough
you
know
very
well
both
of
you
why
i
am
taking
this
step
think
and
say
about
me
what
you
like
i
have
no
time
to
talk
and
so
i
bid
you
they
did
not
seek
to
detain
him
but
stood
mute
whilst
he
left
the
room
the
little
boy
timid
and
impatient
was
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
his
father
enveloped
him
warmly
in
a
shawl
and
so
they
went
forth
it
was
not
long
before
they
met
with
a
vacant
cab
s
drive
brought
them
to
the
where
peachey
had
had
his
chop
that
evening
and
here
he
obtained
a
bedroom
for
the
night
by
eleven
o
clock
the
child
slept
peacefully
the
father
seated
at
a
table
was
engaged
in
writing
to
a
solicitor
at
midnight
he
lay
softly
down
by
the
child
s
side
and
there
until
dawn
listened
to
the
low
breathing
of
his
innocent
little
bedfellow
though
he
could
not
sleep
it
was
joy
rather
than
any
painful
excitement
that
kept
him
wakeful
a
great
and
loathsome
burden
had
fallen
from
him
and
in
the
same
moment
he
had
rescued
his
boy
out
of
an
atmosphere
of
hated
impurity
at
length
he
could
respect
himself
and
for
the
first
time
in
four
long
years
he
looked
to
the
future
with
tranquil
hope
careless
of
the
frank
curiosity
with
which
the
people
of
the
house
regarded
him
he
went
down
at
seven
o
clock
and
asked
for
a
railway
having
found
a
convenient
train
to
canterbury
he
ordered
breakfast
for
himself
and
the
child
to
be
laid
in
a
private
room
it
was
a
merry
meal
sunshine
of
midsummer
fell
warm
and
bright
upon
the
table
the
street
below
was
so
full
of
busy
life
that
the
little
boy
must
needs
have
his
breakfast
by
the
window
where
he
could
eat
and
look
forth
at
the
same
time
no
such
delightful
holiday
had
he
ever
enjoyed
alone
with
father
and
going
away
by
train
into
wonderful
new
worlds
is
emma
coming
he
asked
it
was
significant
that
he
did
not
speak
of
his
mother
they
drove
to
the
railway
station
peachey
no
less
excited
than
the
child
from
here
he
despatched
a
telegram
to
his
partners
saying
that
he
should
be
absent
for
a
day
or
two
then
the
train
struggling
slowly
out
of
london
s
welter
through
the
newest
outposts
of
gloom
and
grime
bore
them
hearts
companioned
in
love
and
blamelessness
to
the
broad
sunny
meadows
and
the
sweet
of
kent
chapter
serves
her
jolly
well
right
said
beatrice
a
lot
care
said
fanny
i
should
think
myself
precious
lucky
she
gets
rid
of
him
and
of
the
kid
too
and
has
as
much
as
she
wants
to
live
on
it
s
better
than
she
do
you
believe
he
s
been
carrying
on
with
that
girl
miss
french
laughed
contemptuously
not
he
well
there
s
been
a
jolly
good
row
if
we
never
see
another
we
shall
all
be
in
the
papers
the
prospect
had
charms
for
fanny
what
are
you
going
to
do
live
here
till
christmas
beatrice
was
quietly
reviewing
the
situation
she
kept
silence
and
her
sister
also
became
meditative
suddenly
fanny
inquired
what
sort
of
a
place
is
brussels
brussels
why
i
know
nothing
about
it
not
much
of
a
place
i
think
sprouts
come
from
there
don
t
they
it
s
a
big
town
said
the
other
and
a
lively
sort
of
place
they
say
why
do
you
ask
me
if
you
know
what
about
it
as
usual
when
performing
the
operation
which
in
her
answered
to
thought
fanny
shuffled
with
her
hands
on
her
waist
at
a
distance
from
beatrice
she
stood
still
and
said
some
one
i
know
is
going
there
i
ve
a
good
mind
to
go
too
i
want
to
see
her
sister
asked
several
searching
questions
but
fanny
would
not
make
known
whether
the
friend
was
male
or
female
i
shouldn
t
be
much
surprised
remarked
the
woman
of
business
indifferently
if
you
go
and
make
a
fool
of
yourself
before
long
that
damerel
is
up
to
some
game
with
you
any
one
could
see
it
with
half
an
eye
i
suppose
it
isn
t
lord
that
s
going
to
brussels
fanny
sputtered
her
disdain
if
you
had
any
common
sense
pursued
her
sister
you
d
stick
to
him
but
you
haven
t
oh
yes
you
think
you
can
do
better
very
well
we
shall
see
if
you
find
yourself
in
a
hole
one
of
these
days
don
t
expect
to
pull
you
out
i
wouldn
t
give
you
a
penny
to
save
you
from
the
wait
till
you
re
asked
i
know
where
all
money
ll
go
to
and
that
s
into
crewe
s
pocket
he
ll
fool
you
out
of
all
you
beatrice
reddened
with
wrath
but
unlike
the
other
members
of
her
family
she
could
command
her
tongue
fanny
found
it
impossible
to
draw
another
word
from
her
on
returning
from
the
haggard
and
faint
with
excitement
but
supported
by
the
anticipation
of
fresh
attacks
upon
her
husband
ada
immediately
learnt
what
had
happened
for
the
first
moment
she
could
hardly
believe
it
she
rushed
upstairs
and
saw
that
the
child
was
really
gone
then
a
blind
frenzy
took
hold
upon
her
alarming
and
inexplicable
sounds
drew
her
sisters
from
below
they
found
her
armed
with
something
heavy
smashing
every
breakable
object
in
her
bedroom
mirrors
pictures
ornaments
she
s
gone
mad
shrieked
fanny
she
ll
kill
us
that
beast
shall
pay
for
it
yelled
ada
with
a
frantic
blow
at
the
wanton
destruction
of
property
revolted
all
beatrice
s
instincts
courageous
enough
she
sprang
upon
the
wild
animal
and
flung
her
down
now
indeed
the
last
trace
of
veneer
was
gone
the
last
rag
of
was
rent
off
these
young
women
in
physical
conflict
vilifying
each
other
like
the
female
spawn
of
whitechapel
they
revealed
themselves
as
born
raw
material
which
the
mill
of
education
is
supposed
to
convert
into
ladyhood
as
a
result
of
being
held
still
by
superior
strength
ada
fell
into
convulsions
foamed
at
the
mouth
her
eyes
starting
from
their
sockets
then
she
lay
as
one
dead
you
ve
killed
her
cried
the
terrified
fanny
no
fear
give
me
some
water
to
pitch
over
with
a
full
jug
from
another
bedroom
she
drenched
the
prostrate
figure
when
ada
came
round
she
was
powerless
even
her
rancorous
lips
could
utter
only
a
sound
of
moaning
the
sisters
stripped
her
stark
naked
on
the
floor
made
a
show
of
drying
her
with
towels
and
tumbled
her
into
bed
then
beatrice
brewed
a
great
jorum
of
hot
and
after
drinking
freely
to
steady
her
shaken
nerves
poured
a
pint
or
so
down
peachey
s
throat
there
won
t
be
a
funeral
just
yet
she
remarked
with
a
laugh
now
we
ll
have
supper
i
feel
they
went
to
bed
at
something
after
midnight
the
servants
having
stolen
a
bottle
of
spirits
from
the
cupboard
which
beatrice
left
open
both
got
drunk
and
slept
till
morning
upon
the
on
the
morrow
miss
french
attired
as
a
walking
advertisement
of
the
south
london
fashionable
dress
supply
association
betook
herself
to
farringdon
street
for
an
interview
with
her
commercial
friend
crewe
was
absent
but
one
of
three
clerks
who
occupied
his
largest
room
informed
her
that
it
could
not
be
very
long
before
he
returned
and
being
so
familiar
a
figure
here
she
was
permitted
to
wait
in
the
agent
s
sanctum
when
the
door
closed
upon
her
the
three
young
men
discussed
her
character
with
sprightly
freedom
beatrice
the
while
splendidly
indifferent
to
the
remarks
she
could
easily
divine
made
a
rapid
examination
of
loose
papers
lying
on
crewe
s
desk
read
several
letters
opened
several
books
and
found
nothing
that
interested
her
until
on
turning
over
a
slip
of
paper
with
pencilled
figures
upon
it
she
discovered
a
the
heading
royal
hotel
falmouth
it
was
for
a
day
and
night
s
entertainment
the
debtor
mr
crewe
the
date
less
than
a
week
gone
by
this
document
she
considered
attentively
her
brows
knitted
her
eyes
wide
but
a
sound
caused
her
to
drop
it
upon
the
desk
again
another
moment
and
crewe
entered
he
looked
keenly
at
her
and
less
than
of
wont
these
persons
never
shook
hands
and
indeed
dispensed
as
a
rule
with
all
forms
of
civility
what
are
you
staring
at
asked
crewe
bluffly
what
are
staring
at
nothing
that
i
he
hung
up
his
hat
and
sat
down
i
ve
a
note
to
write
wait
a
the
note
written
and
given
to
a
clerk
crewe
seemed
to
recover
equanimity
his
visitor
told
him
all
that
happened
in
de
crespigny
park
even
to
the
crudest
details
and
they
laughed
together
uproariously
i
m
going
to
take
a
flat
beatrice
then
informed
him
just
find
me
something
convenient
and
moderate
will
you
a
bachelor
s
what
about
fanny
she
has
something
on
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
talks
about
going
to
brussels
with
a
crewe
looked
astonished
you
ought
to
see
after
her
i
know
what
the
end
ll
be
brussels
i
ve
heard
of
english
girls
going
there
but
they
don
t
usually
come
what
can
i
do
i
m
pretty
certain
that
damerel
woman
has
a
game
on
hand
she
doesn
t
want
fanny
to
marry
her
nephew
if
lord
her
nephew
she
wants
his
money
that
s
my
mine
too
remarked
the
other
quietly
look
here
old
chap
it
s
your
duty
to
look
after
your
little
damned
fool
of
a
sister
i
tell
you
that
plainly
i
shan
t
think
well
of
you
if
you
don
beatrice
displayed
eagerness
to
defend
herself
she
had
done
her
best
fanny
scorned
all
advice
and
could
not
be
held
against
her
will
has
she
given
up
all
thought
of
lord
i
m
not
sure
but
i
think
so
and
it
looks
as
if
he
was
going
his
own
way
and
didn
t
care
much
he
never
writes
to
her
now
of
course
it
s
that
woman
s
crewe
reflected
i
shall
have
to
look
into
damerel
s
affairs
might
be
worth
while
where
is
she
living
he
made
a
note
of
the
information
well
anything
else
to
tell
me
beatrice
spoke
of
business
matters
then
asked
him
if
he
had
been
out
of
town
lately
the
question
sounded
rather
abrupt
and
caused
crewe
to
regard
her
with
an
expression
she
privately
interpreted
a
few
short
runs
nowhere
oh
not
been
down
into
cornwall
he
lost
his
temper
what
are
you
after
what
business
is
it
of
yours
if
you
re
going
to
spy
on
me
i
ll
soon
let
you
know
that
i
won
t
stand
that
kind
of
don
t
disturb
yourself
said
beatrice
with
a
cold
smile
i
haven
t
been
spying
and
you
can
go
where
you
like
for
anything
i
care
i
guessed
you
been
down
there
that
s
crewe
kept
silence
his
look
betraying
uneasiness
as
well
as
anger
speaking
at
length
he
fixed
her
with
keen
eyes
if
it
s
any
satisfaction
to
you
you
re
welcome
to
know
that
i
have
been
into
cornwall
and
to
beatrice
merely
nodded
and
still
he
searched
her
face
just
answer
me
a
plain
question
old
chap
come
there
s
no
nonsense
between
us
we
know
each
other
eh
oh
yes
we
know
each
other
miss
french
answered
her
lips
puckering
a
little
what
do
you
know
about
what
has
she
been
doing
all
this
time
beatrice
laughed
i
know
just
as
little
about
her
as
i
you
care
a
good
deal
more
than
you
ll
confess
i
wouldn
t
be
up
to
women
s
tricks
if
i
were
she
revolted
after
all
i
suppose
i
a
woman
well
i
suppose
crewe
grinned
but
that
isn
t
in
the
terms
of
our
partnership
you
remember
you
can
be
a
reasonable
fellow
enough
when
you
like
just
tell
me
the
truth
what
do
you
know
about
nancy
lord
beatrice
assumed
an
air
of
mystery
i
ll
tell
you
that
if
you
tell
me
what
it
is
you
want
of
her
is
it
her
money
her
money
be
damned
it
s
herself
and
what
if
it
is
what
have
to
say
to
it
her
eyes
fell
and
she
muttered
just
bear
that
in
mind
then
and
now
that
i
ve
answered
your
question
answer
mine
what
have
you
heard
about
her
or
what
have
you
found
out
she
raised
her
eyes
again
and
again
but
in
a
mocking
voice
said
you
re
telling
me
a
you
re
a
brute
to
say
so
they
exchanged
fierce
glances
but
could
not
meet
each
other
s
eyes
steadily
crewe
mastering
his
irritation
said
with
a
careless
laugh
all
right
i
believe
you
didn
t
mean
to
offend
you
old
i
won
t
be
called
that
she
was
trembling
with
stormy
emotions
you
shall
treat
me
very
well
old
girl
i
m
a
good
deal
younger
than
you
are
and
i
m
a
good
deal
better
than
you
in
every
way
i
m
a
lady
at
all
events
and
you
can
t
pretend
to
be
a
gentleman
you
re
a
rough
common
fellow
holloa
holloa
draw
it
he
was
startled
and
in
some
degree
abashed
his
eyes
travelling
to
the
door
indicated
a
fear
that
this
singular
might
be
overheard
but
beatrice
went
on
without
subduing
her
voice
and
having
delivered
herself
of
much
plain
language
walked
from
the
room
leaving
the
door
open
behind
her
as
a
rule
she
returned
from
her
day
s
occupations
to
dinner
in
de
crespigny
park
at
seven
o
clock
her
arrival
at
home
was
considerably
later
about
three
o
clock
she
made
a
call
at
the
where
damerel
lived
but
was
disappointed
in
her
wish
to
see
that
lady
who
would
not
be
in
before
the
hour
of
dining
she
called
again
at
seven
and
damerel
received
her
very
graciously
it
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
beatrice
in
no
mood
for
polite
grimaces
at
once
disclosed
the
object
of
her
visit
she
wanted
to
talk
about
fanny
did
damerel
know
anything
of
a
proposed
journey
to
brussels
the
lady
professed
utter
ignorance
of
any
such
intention
on
fanny
s
part
she
had
not
seen
fanny
for
at
least
a
fortnight
how
can
that
be
she
told
me
she
dined
here
last
that
s
very
strange
answered
damerel
with
suave
concern
she
certainly
did
not
dine
and
the
sunday
before
your
sister
has
dined
here
only
once
miss
french
and
that
was
three
months
then
i
don
t
understand
it
haven
t
you
been
taking
her
to
theatres
and
parties
and
that
kind
of
thing
i
have
taken
her
once
to
a
theatre
and
twice
to
evening
at
the
last
time
we
were
together
anywhere
was
at
dane
s
about
the
middle
of
may
since
then
i
have
seen
her
hardly
at
all
i
m
very
much
afraid
you
are
under
some
misconception
thinking
your
sister
was
engaged
to
marry
my
nephew
lord
i
naturally
desired
to
offer
her
a
few
friendly
attentions
but
it
came
out
at
length
that
she
did
not
regard
the
engagement
as
serious
i
was
obliged
to
speak
gravely
to
my
young
nephew
and
beg
him
to
consider
his
position
there
is
the
second
but
i
am
quite
at
your
service
miss
french
if
you
wish
to
question
me
beatrice
was
much
inclined
to
resent
this
tone
and
to
use
her
vernacular
but
it
seemed
only
too
probable
that
fanny
had
been
deceiving
her
and
as
she
really
feared
for
the
girl
s
safety
prudence
bade
her
be
civil
with
damerel
can
t
you
help
me
to
find
out
what
fanny
has
really
been
doing
i
m
afraid
it
s
quite
out
of
my
power
she
never
confided
in
me
and
it
is
so
long
since
i
have
seen
anything
of
her
at
it
s
best
to
speak
plainly
said
beatrice
in
her
business
tone
can
t
you
think
of
any
man
in
the
society
you
introduced
her
to
who
may
be
trying
to
lead
her
astray
really
miss
french
the
society
in
which
i
move
is
not
what
you
seem
to
suppose
if
your
sister
is
in
any
danger
of
kind
you
must
make
your
inquiries
elsewhere
in
an
inferior
rank
of
beatrice
no
longer
contained
herself
perhaps
i
know
rather
more
than
you
think
about
your
kind
of
society
there
s
not
much
to
choose
between
the
men
and
the
miss
french
i
believe
you
reside
in
a
part
of
london
called
camberwell
and
i
believe
you
are
engaged
in
some
kind
of
millinery
business
this
excuses
you
for
all
the
same
i
must
beg
you
to
relieve
me
of
your
she
rang
the
bell
good
i
dare
say
we
shall
see
each
other
again
replied
beatrice
with
an
insulting
laugh
i
heard
some
one
say
that
it
might
be
as
well
to
find
out
you
really
and
if
any
harm
comes
to
fanny
i
shall
take
a
little
trouble
about
that
inquiry
damerel
changed
colour
but
no
movement
betrayed
anxiety
in
the
attitude
of
dignified
disdain
she
kept
her
eyes
on
a
point
above
miss
french
s
head
and
stood
so
until
the
plebeian
adversary
had
withdrawn
then
she
sat
down
and
for
a
few
minutes
communed
with
herself
in
the
end
instead
of
going
to
dinner
she
rang
her
bell
again
a
servant
appeared
is
mankelow
in
the
yes
ma
ask
him
to
be
kind
enough
to
come
here
for
a
with
little
delay
mankelow
answered
the
summons
which
called
him
from
his
soup
he
wore
evening
dress
his
thin
hair
was
parted
down
the
middle
his
and
rather
florid
face
expressed
the
annoyance
of
a
hungry
man
at
so
unseasonable
an
interruption
do
forgive
me
began
damerel
in
a
pathetic
falsetto
i
have
been
so
upset
i
felt
obliged
to
seek
advice
immediately
and
no
one
seemed
so
likely
to
be
of
help
to
me
as
you
a
man
of
the
world
would
you
believe
that
a
sister
of
that
silly
little
miss
french
has
just
been
here
a
downright
virago
declaring
that
the
girl
has
been
led
astray
and
that
i
am
responsible
for
it
can
you
imagine
such
impertinence
she
has
fibbed
shockingly
to
the
people
at
home
told
them
she
was
constantly
here
with
me
in
the
evenings
when
she
must
have
been
who
knows
where
it
will
teach
me
to
meddle
again
with
girls
of
that
mankelow
stood
with
his
hands
behind
him
and
legs
apart
regarding
the
speaker
with
a
comically
puzzled
air
my
dear
damerel
he
had
a
thick
military
sort
of
voice
why
in
the
world
should
this
interpose
between
us
and
dinner
afterwards
we
might
but
i
am
really
anxious
about
the
silly
little
creature
it
would
be
extremely
disagreeable
if
my
name
got
mixed
up
in
a
scandal
of
any
kind
you
remember
my
telling
you
that
she
didn
t
belong
exactly
to
the
she
has
even
a
little
property
of
her
own
and
i
shouldn
t
wonder
if
she
has
friends
who
might
make
a
disturbance
if
her
her
vagaries
could
be
in
any
way
connected
with
me
and
my
circle
something
was
mentioned
about
brussels
she
has
been
chattering
about
some
one
who
wanted
to
take
her
to
brussels
the
listener
arched
his
eyebrows
more
and
more
what
it
matter
to
you
to
be
sure
i
have
no
acquaintance
with
any
one
who
could
do
such
things
why
of
course
not
and
even
if
you
had
i
understand
that
the
girl
is
long
out
of
her
teens
long
then
it
s
her
own
affair
and
that
of
the
man
who
cares
to
purchase
such
amusement
it
happens
rather
oddly
that
i
myself
have
to
run
over
to
brussels
on
business
but
i
trust
he
laughed
that
my
years
and
my
character
oh
mankelow
absurd
it
s
probably
some
commercial
traveller
or
man
of
that
sort
don
t
you
think
the
one
thing
i
hope
is
that
if
anything
like
this
happens
the
girl
will
somehow
make
it
clear
to
her
friends
that
had
no
knowledge
whatever
of
what
was
going
on
but
that
can
hardly
be
hoped
i
fear
their
eyes
crossed
they
stood
for
a
moment
perusing
vacancy
yes
i
think
it
might
be
hoped
said
mankelow
airily
she
seemed
to
me
a
rather
reckless
sort
of
young
person
it
s
highly
probable
she
will
write
letters
which
release
every
one
but
herself
from
responsibility
in
fact
he
gazed
at
her
with
a
cynical
smile
my
knowledge
of
human
nature
disposes
me
to
assure
you
that
she
certainly
will
she
might
even
i
should
say
write
a
letter
to
perhaps
a
cheeky
sort
of
letter
which
would
at
once
set
your
mind
at
oh
if
you
really
take
that
view
i
do
indeed
don
t
you
think
we
might
dismiss
the
matter
and
dine
they
did
so
until
noon
of
peachey
had
kept
her
bed
lying
amid
the
wreck
wrought
by
last
night
s
madness
she
then
felt
well
enough
to
rise
and
after
refreshment
betook
herself
by
cab
to
the
offices
of
messrs
ducker
blunt
manufacturers
of
disinfectants
where
she
conversed
with
one
of
the
partners
and
learnt
that
her
husband
had
telegraphed
his
intention
to
be
absent
for
a
day
or
two
having
with
the
which
distinguished
her
related
her
story
from
the
most
calumnious
point
of
view
she
went
home
again
to
nurse
her
headache
and
quarrel
with
fanny
but
fanny
had
in
the
meantime
left
home
and
unaccountable
fact
had
taken
with
her
a
large
tin
box
and
a
heavily
packed
said
the
servants
her
direction
to
the
cabman
was
merely
westminster
bridge
which
conveyed
to
peachey
no
sort
of
suggestion
when
beatrice
came
back
and
learnt
this
event
she
went
apart
in
wrathful
gloom
ada
could
not
engage
her
in
a
quarrel
it
was
a
wretchedly
dull
evening
they
talked
next
morning
and
beatrice
announced
her
purpose
of
going
to
live
by
herself
as
soon
as
possible
but
she
would
not
quarrel
left
alone
ada
prepared
to
visit
certain
of
their
relatives
in
different
parts
of
london
to
spread
among
them
the
news
of
her
husband
s
infamy
chapter
when
mary
woodruff
unlocked
the
and
entered
the
little
hall
it
smelt
and
felt
as
though
the
damp
and
sooty
fogs
of
winter
still
lingered
here
untouched
by
the
july
warmth
she
came
alone
and
straightway
spent
several
hours
in
characteristic
activity
airing
cleaning
brightening
for
a
few
days
there
would
be
no
servant
mary
after
her
long
leisure
down
in
cornwall
enjoyed
the
prospect
of
doing
all
the
work
herself
they
had
reached
london
last
evening
and
had
slept
at
a
family
hotel
where
nancy
remained
until
the
house
was
in
order
for
her
unhappily
their
arrival
timed
with
a
change
of
weather
which
brought
clouds
and
rain
the
glories
of
an
unshadowed
sky
would
have
little
more
than
availed
to
support
nancy
s
courage
as
she
passed
the
creaking
little
gate
and
touched
the
threshold
of
a
home
to
which
she
returned
only
on
compulsion
gloom
overhead
and
puddles
underfoot
tried
her
spirit
sorely
she
had
a
pale
face
and
thin
cheeks
and
moved
with
languid
step
her
first
glance
was
at
the
nothing
mary
shook
her
head
during
their
absence
letters
had
been
by
the
and
since
the
notice
of
return
nothing
had
come
i
m
quite
sure
a
letter
has
been
yes
it
may
have
been
but
there
ll
be
an
answer
to
your
last
very
i
don
t
think
so
most
likely
i
shall
never
hear
and
nancy
sat
by
the
window
of
the
front
room
looking
as
she
had
looked
so
many
a
time
at
the
lime
tree
opposite
and
the
house
visible
through
wet
branches
a
view
unchanged
since
she
could
remember
recalling
all
her
old
ambitions
revolts
pretences
and
ignorances
recalling
her
father
who
from
his
grave
still
oppressed
her
living
heart
somewhere
near
sounded
the
wailing
shout
of
a
dustman
it
was
like
the
voice
of
a
soul
condemned
to
purge
itself
in
filth
mary
she
rose
up
and
went
to
the
kitchen
i
can
t
live
here
it
will
kill
me
if
i
have
to
live
in
this
dreadful
place
why
even
you
have
been
crying
i
can
see
you
have
if
give
way
think
what
it
must
be
to
me
it
s
only
for
a
day
or
two
dear
answered
mary
we
shall
feel
at
home
again
very
soon
miss
morgan
will
come
this
evening
and
perhaps
your
i
must
do
something
give
me
some
mary
could
not
but
regard
this
as
a
healthy
symptom
and
she
suggested
tasks
that
called
for
moderate
effort
sick
of
reading
she
had
read
through
a
whole
circulating
library
in
the
past
six
months
nancy
bestirred
herself
about
the
house
but
she
avoided
her
father
s
room
horace
did
not
come
a
note
arrived
from
him
saying
that
he
would
call
early
morning
but
at
jessica
presented
herself
she
looked
less
ghostly
than
half
a
year
ago
the
grave
illness
through
which
she
had
passed
seemed
to
have
been
helpful
to
her
constitution
yet
she
was
noticeably
changed
in
her
letters
nancy
had
remarked
an
excessive
simplicity
a
sort
of
childishness
very
unlike
jessica
s
previous
way
of
writing
and
the
same
peculiarity
now
appeared
in
her
conversation
by
turns
she
was
mawkish
and
sprightly
tearful
and
giggling
her
dress
formerly
neglected
to
the
point
of
untidiness
betrayed
a
taste
for
fashionable
equipment
she
suddenly
drew
attention
to
it
in
the
midst
of
serious
talk
asking
with
a
bashful
smirk
whether
nancy
thought
it
suited
her
i
got
it
at
miss
french
s
place
the
association
you
know
it
s
really
wonderful
how
cheap
things
are
there
and
the
very
best
cut
by
dressmakers
from
nancy
wondered
and
felt
that
her
diminishing
regard
for
miss
morgan
had
suffered
a
fresh
blow
there
was
much
news
to
receive
and
impart
in
writing
from
falmouth
nancy
had
referred
to
the
details
of
her
own
life
with
studied
ambiguity
she
regretted
having
taken
jessica
into
her
confidence
and
avoided
penning
a
word
which
if
read
by
any
one
but
her
correspondent
would
betray
the
perilous
secret
jessica
after
her
illness
was
inclined
to
resent
this
extreme
caution
which
irritated
her
curiosity
but
in
vain
she
assured
nancy
that
there
was
not
the
least
fear
of
her
letters
falling
into
wrong
hands
for
weeks
at
a
time
she
heard
nothing
and
then
would
come
a
letter
long
indeed
but
without
a
syllable
of
the
information
she
desired
near
the
end
of
may
she
received
a
line
or
two
i
have
been
really
ill
but
am
now
much
better
i
shall
stay
here
only
a
few
weeks
more
don
t
be
anxious
i
am
well
cared
for
and
the
worst
is
she
heard
the
interpretation
from
nancy
s
lips
and
laughed
and
cried
over
it
what
you
must
have
suffered
my
poor
dear
and
to
be
separated
from
the
little
darling
oh
it
s
too
cruel
you
are
sure
they
will
be
kind
to
it
mary
has
every
confidence
in
the
woman
and
i
like
the
look
of
her
i
don
t
feel
uneasy
i
shall
go
there
very
often
of
and
when
is
coming
back
he
oughtn
t
to
have
kept
away
all
this
time
how
unkind
not
at
all
nancy
replied
with
sudden
reserve
he
is
acting
for
the
best
you
mustn
t
ask
me
about
that
you
shall
know
more
some
jessica
whose
face
made
legible
presentment
of
her
every
thought
looked
disappointed
and
peevish
and
you
are
really
going
in
for
the
examination
again
nancy
asked
oh
of
course
i
am
answered
the
other
perkily
but
not
till
summer
of
next
year
i
m
not
allowed
to
study
much
yet
the
doctor
says
i
might
do
my
brain
a
serious
injury
i
read
a
great
deal
books
that
rest
the
mind
poetry
and
fiction
of
course
only
the
very
best
fiction
i
shall
soon
be
able
to
begin
teaching
again
but
i
must
be
very
careful
only
an
hour
or
two
a
day
at
first
and
perhaps
quite
young
evidently
the
girl
felt
a
certain
pride
in
what
she
had
undergone
her
failure
to
matriculate
was
forgotten
in
the
sense
that
she
offered
a
most
interesting
case
of
breakdown
from
undue
mental
exertion
the
doctor
had
declared
his
astonishment
that
she
held
up
until
the
examination
was
over
he
simply
wouldn
t
believe
me
when
i
told
him
the
hours
i
worked
he
said
i
ought
to
be
on
my
trial
for
attempted
suicide
and
she
laughed
with
extravagant
conceit
you
have
quite
made
friends
with
the
barmbys
said
nancy
eyeing
her
curiously
they
are
very
nice
people
of
course
the
girls
quite
understand
what
a
difference
there
is
between
themselves
and
me
i
like
them
because
they
are
so
modest
they
would
never
think
of
contradicting
my
opinion
about
and
what
about
the
prophet
i
don
t
think
you
ever
quite
understood
him
jessica
replied
with
an
obvious
confusion
which
perplexed
her
friend
he
isn
t
at
all
the
kind
of
man
you
no
doubt
i
was
wrong
nancy
hastened
to
say
it
was
prejudice
and
you
remember
that
i
never
had
any
fault
to
find
with
his
his
you
disliked
him
said
the
other
sharply
and
you
still
dislike
him
i
m
sure
you
so
plainly
did
jessica
desire
a
confirmation
of
this
statement
that
nancy
allowed
herself
to
be
drawn
into
half
avowing
a
positive
dislike
for
samuel
whereupon
jessica
looked
pleased
and
tossed
her
head
in
a
singular
way
i
needn
t
remind
you
fell
from
nancy
after
a
moment
of
troubled
reflection
how
careful
you
must
be
in
talking
about
me
to
the
oh
don
t
have
the
slightest
weren
t
you
delirious
in
your
illness
i
should
think
i
was
indeed
for
a
long
i
hope
you
said
nothing
about
you
oh
not
a
word
i
m
quite
sure
i
talked
all
the
time
about
my
studies
the
doctor
heard
me
one
day
repeating
a
long
bit
of
virgil
and
i
kept
calling
for
bits
of
paper
to
work
out
problems
in
geometrical
progression
just
fancy
i
don
t
think
most
girls
are
delirious
in
that
way
if
i
had
said
anything
about
you
that
sounded
queer
of
course
mother
would
have
told
me
afterwards
oh
it
was
quite
an
intellectual
had
jessica
since
her
illness
become
an
insufferable
simpleton
or
nancy
wondered
was
it
she
herself
who
through
experience
and
sorrows
was
grown
wiser
and
saw
her
friend
in
a
new
light
it
troubled
her
gravely
that
the
preservation
of
a
secret
more
than
ever
momentous
should
depend
upon
a
person
with
so
little
sense
the
girl
s
departure
was
a
relief
but
in
the
silence
that
followed
upon
silly
talk
she
had
leisure
to
contemplate
this
risk
hitherto
scarce
taken
into
account
she
spoke
of
it
with
mary
the
one
friend
to
whom
her
heart
went
out
in
absolute
trust
from
whom
she
concealed
but
few
of
her
thoughts
and
whose
moral
worth
only
understood
since
circumstances
compelled
her
reliance
upon
it
had
set
before
her
a
new
ideal
of
life
mary
she
well
knew
abhorred
the
deceit
they
were
practising
and
thought
hard
things
of
the
man
who
made
it
a
necessity
so
it
did
not
surprise
her
that
the
devoted
woman
showed
no
deep
concern
at
a
new
danger
it
s
more
the
shame
than
anything
else
that
i
fear
now
said
nancy
if
i
have
to
support
myself
and
my
child
i
shall
do
it
how
i
don
t
know
but
other
women
find
a
way
and
i
should
if
he
deserts
me
i
am
not
such
a
poor
creature
as
to
grieve
on
that
account
i
should
despise
him
too
much
even
to
hate
him
but
the
shame
of
it
would
be
terrible
it
s
common
vulgar
cheating
such
as
you
read
of
in
the
newspapers
such
as
people
are
punished
for
i
never
thought
of
it
in
that
way
when
he
was
here
yet
he
felt
it
he
spoke
of
it
like
that
but
i
wouldn
t
mary
heard
this
with
interest
did
he
wish
you
to
give
it
up
she
asked
you
never
told
me
he
said
he
would
rather
we
did
but
that
was
when
he
had
never
thought
of
being
in
want
himself
afterwards
yes
even
then
he
spoke
in
the
same
way
but
what
could
we
do
don
t
fear
that
he
will
forsake
you
said
mary
you
will
hear
from
him
very
soon
he
knows
the
right
and
the
wrong
and
right
will
be
stronger
with
him
in
the
if
only
i
were
sure
that
he
has
heard
of
his
child
s
birth
if
he
and
won
t
even
write
to
me
then
he
is
no
man
and
it
s
better
we
should
never
see
each
other
she
knew
the
hours
of
postal
delivery
and
listened
with
throbbing
heart
to
the
double
knocks
at
neighbouring
houses
when
the
last
postman
was
gone
by
she
sat
down
sick
with
disappointment
at
bedtime
she
said
to
mary
my
little
baby
is
asleep
oh
if
i
could
but
see
it
for
a
moment
and
tears
choked
her
as
she
turned
away
it
was
more
than
two
months
since
she
had
heard
from
her
husband
at
first
tarrant
wrote
as
frequently
as
he
had
promised
she
learnt
speedily
of
his
arrival
at
new
york
then
that
he
had
reached
nassau
the
capital
of
the
bahamas
then
that
he
was
with
his
friend
sutherland
on
the
little
island
amid
the
coral
reefs
subsequent
letters
written
in
buoyant
spirits
contained
long
descriptions
of
the
scenery
about
him
and
of
the
life
he
led
he
expressed
a
firm
confidence
in
sutherland
s
enterprises
beyond
a
doubt
there
was
no
end
of
money
to
be
made
by
an
energetic
man
he
should
report
most
favourably
to
vawdrey
whose
would
of
course
be
invaluable
for
his
own
part
whether
he
profited
or
not
from
these
commercial
schemes
he
had
not
been
mistaken
in
foreseeing
material
for
journalism
even
for
a
book
yes
he
should
certainly
write
a
book
on
the
bahamas
if
only
to
expose
the
monstrous
system
of
misgovernment
which
accounted
for
the
sterility
into
which
these
islands
had
fallen
the
climate
in
winter
at
all
events
was
superb
sutherland
and
he
lay
about
in
delicious
sunshine
under
a
marvellous
sky
smoking
excellent
cigars
and
talking
over
old
oxford
days
he
quoted
tennyson
larger
constellations
burning
at
the
end
of
december
when
nancy
according
to
their
agreement
began
to
hope
for
his
return
a
letter
in
a
very
different
tone
burdened
her
with
dismal
doubts
tarrant
had
quarrelled
with
his
friend
he
had
discovered
that
sutherland
was
little
better
than
a
swindler
i
see
that
the
fellow
s
professed
energy
was
all
sham
he
is
the
laziest
scamp
imaginable
lazier
even
than
his
boozing
old
father
he
schemes
only
to
get
money
out
of
people
and
his
disappointment
on
finding
that
have
no
money
to
lose
has
shown
itself
at
length
in
very
gross
forms
i
find
he
is
a
gambler
there
has
just
been
a
tremendous
row
between
him
and
an
american
whom
he
is
said
to
have
cheated
at
cards
last
year
he
was
for
several
weeks
in
mexico
city
a
place
notorious
for
gambling
and
there
lost
a
large
sum
of
money
that
didn
t
belong
to
the
upshot
was
that
he
could
no
longer
advise
vawdrey
to
have
anything
to
do
with
sutherland
but
he
must
not
leave
the
bahamas
yet
that
would
be
most
unwise
as
he
was
daily
gathering
most
valuable
information
vawdrey
might
be
induced
to
lend
him
a
hundred
pounds
or
so
but
he
would
write
again
very
soon
it
was
the
close
of
january
when
he
dated
his
next
letter
vawdrey
had
sent
him
fifty
pounds
this
however
was
to
include
the
cost
of
his
return
to
england
see
then
what
i
have
decided
i
shall
make
a
hurried
tour
through
the
west
indian
islands
then
cross
to
the
states
and
travel
by
land
to
new
york
or
boston
seeing
all
i
can
afford
to
on
the
way
if
i
have
to
come
home
as
a
steerage
passenger
never
mind
that
too
will
be
valuable
there
followed
many
affectionate
phrases
but
nancy
s
heart
remained
cold
he
wrote
next
from
washington
after
six
weeks
silence
difficulties
of
which
he
would
speak
at
length
in
another
letter
had
caused
him
to
postpone
answering
the
two
letters
he
had
received
nancy
must
never
lose
faith
in
him
his
love
was
unshaken
before
the
birth
of
her
child
he
would
assuredly
be
back
in
england
let
her
address
to
new
york
he
was
well
but
could
not
pretend
to
be
very
cheerful
however
courage
he
had
plans
and
hopes
of
which
she
should
soon
hear
after
that
nancy
knew
nothing
of
him
save
that
he
was
living
in
new
york
he
wrote
two
or
three
times
but
briefly
always
promising
details
in
the
next
epistle
then
he
ceased
to
correspond
not
even
the
announcement
of
the
child
s
birth
elicited
a
word
from
him
one
subsequent
letter
had
nancy
despatched
this
unanswered
she
would
write
no
more
she
was
herself
surprised
at
the
calmness
with
which
she
faced
so
dreadful
a
possibility
as
desertion
by
the
man
she
had
loved
and
married
the
father
of
her
baby
it
meant
perhaps
that
she
could
not
believe
such
fate
had
really
befallen
her
even
in
tarrant
s
last
short
letter
sounded
a
note
of
kindness
of
truthfulness
incompatible
it
seemed
to
her
with
base
cruelty
i
dreamt
of
you
last
night
dearest
and
woke
up
with
a
heart
that
ached
for
your
how
could
a
man
pen
those
words
and
be
meditating
dastardly
behaviour
to
the
woman
he
addressed
was
he
ill
then
or
had
fatal
accident
befallen
him
she
feared
such
explanation
only
in
her
weakest
moments
if
long
ago
he
could
keep
silence
for
six
weeks
at
a
time
why
not
now
for
months
as
for
the
news
she
had
sent
him
does
a
man
think
it
important
that
a
little
child
has
been
born
into
the
world
likely
enough
that
again
he
merely
postponed
writing
of
course
he
no
longer
loved
her
say
what
he
might
at
most
he
thought
of
her
with
a
feeling
of
compassion
not
strong
enough
to
overcome
his
dislike
of
exertion
he
would
come
back
when
it
pleased
him
nancy
would
not
sully
her
mind
by
thinking
that
he
might
only
return
when
her
position
made
it
worth
his
while
he
was
not
a
man
of
that
stamp
simply
he
had
ceased
to
care
for
her
and
having
no
means
of
his
own
whilst
she
was
abundantly
provided
he
yielded
to
the
temptation
to
hold
aloof
from
a
woman
whose
claim
upon
him
grew
burdensome
her
thoughts
admitted
no
worse
accusation
than
this
did
any
grave
ill
befall
her
if
for
instance
the
fact
of
her
marriage
became
known
and
she
were
left
helpless
her
letter
to
new
york
would
not
be
disregarded
to
reflect
thus
signified
a
mental
balance
rare
in
women
and
remarkable
in
one
situated
as
nancy
was
she
talked
with
her
companion
far
less
consistently
for
talk
served
to
relieve
the
oppression
of
her
heart
and
mind
when
next
morning
horace
entered
the
brother
and
sister
viewed
each
other
with
surprise
neither
was
prepared
for
the
outward
change
wrought
in
both
by
the
past
nancy
looked
what
she
in
truth
had
become
a
matronly
young
woman
in
uncertain
health
and
possessed
by
a
view
of
life
too
grave
for
her
years
horace
no
longer
a
mere
lad
exhibited
in
sunken
cheeks
and
eyes
bright
with
an
unhappy
recklessness
the
acquisition
of
experience
which
corrupts
before
it
can
mature
moving
to
offer
her
lips
nancy
was
checked
by
the
young
man
s
exclamation
what
on
earth
has
been
the
matter
with
you
i
never
saw
any
one
so
his
voice
with
its
deepened
note
and
the
modification
of
his
very
accent
due
to
novel
circumstances
checked
the
hearer
s
affectionate
impulse
if
not
unfeeling
the
utterance
had
nothing
fraternal
deeply
pained
and
no
less
alarmed
by
this
warning
of
the
curiosity
her
appearance
would
excite
in
all
who
knew
her
nancy
made
a
faltering
reply
why
should
you
seem
astonished
you
know
very
well
i
have
had
an
but
what
sort
of
illness
what
caused
it
you
used
always
to
be
well
you
had
better
go
and
talk
to
my
medical
attendant
said
nancy
in
a
cold
offended
voice
horace
resumed
with
irritability
isn
t
it
natural
for
me
to
ask
such
questions
you
re
not
a
bit
like
yourself
and
what
did
you
mean
by
telling
me
you
were
coming
back
at
once
when
i
wanted
to
join
you
at
falmouth
i
meant
to
but
after
all
i
had
to
stay
oh
well
it
s
nothing
to
they
had
not
even
shaken
hands
and
now
felt
no
desire
to
correct
the
omission
which
was
at
first
involuntary
horace
seemed
to
have
lost
all
the
amiability
of
his
nature
he
looked
about
him
with
restless
excited
eyes
are
you
in
a
hurry
asked
his
sister
head
erect
no
hurry
that
i
know
you
haven
t
heard
what
s
been
going
on
where
of
course
it
won
t
interest
you
there
s
something
about
you
i
can
t
understand
is
it
father
s
will
that
has
spoilt
your
temper
and
made
you
behave
so
strangely
it
is
not
temper
that
s
spoilt
and
as
for
behaving
strangely
she
made
an
effort
to
command
herself
sit
down
horace
and
let
me
know
what
is
the
matter
with
you
why
we
should
be
unfriendly
i
really
can
t
imagine
i
have
suffered
from
ill
health
that
s
all
i
m
sorry
i
behaved
in
that
way
when
you
talked
of
coming
to
falmouth
it
wasn
t
meant
as
you
seem
to
think
tell
me
what
you
have
to
he
could
not
take
a
reposeful
attitude
but
after
struggling
with
some
reluctance
began
to
explain
the
agitation
that
beset
him
mrs
damerel
has
done
something
i
didn
t
think
any
woman
would
be
capable
of
for
months
she
has
been
trying
to
ruin
fanny
and
now
it
has
come
she
has
succeeded
she
made
no
secret
of
wanting
to
break
things
off
between
her
and
me
but
i
never
thought
her
plotting
could
go
as
far
as
this
fanny
has
run
away
gone
to
the
continent
with
a
man
damerel
introduced
to
perhaps
they
are
married
said
nancy
with
singular
impulsiveness
of
course
they
re
not
it
s
a
fellow
i
knew
to
be
a
scoundrel
the
first
time
i
set
eyes
on
him
i
warned
fanny
against
him
and
i
told
damerel
that
i
should
hold
her
responsible
if
any
harm
came
of
the
acquaintance
she
was
encouraging
between
him
and
fanny
she
did
encourage
it
though
she
pretended
not
to
her
aim
was
to
separate
me
and
fanny
she
didn
t
care
he
spoke
in
a
high
vehement
note
his
cheeks
flushed
violently
his
clenched
fist
quivered
at
his
side
how
do
you
know
where
she
is
gone
nancy
asked
she
as
good
as
told
her
sister
that
she
was
going
to
brussels
with
some
one
then
one
day
she
disappeared
with
her
luggage
and
that
fellow
mankelow
s
his
name
has
gone
too
he
lived
in
the
same
with
that
is
all
the
evidence
you
have
quite
enough
he
replied
bitterly
it
doesn
t
seem
so
to
me
but
suppose
you
re
right
what
proof
have
you
that
damerel
had
anything
to
do
with
it
if
she
is
our
mother
s
sister
and
you
say
there
can
be
no
doubt
of
it
i
won
t
believe
that
she
could
carry
out
such
a
hateful
plot
as
what
does
it
matter
who
she
is
i
would
swear
fifty
times
that
she
has
done
it
you
know
very
well
when
you
saw
her
you
disliked
her
at
once
you
were
right
in
that
and
i
was
i
can
t
be
sure
perhaps
it
was
she
that
disliked
me
more
than
i
did
her
for
one
thing
i
don
t
believe
that
people
make
such
plots
and
what
plotting
was
needed
couldn
t
any
one
have
told
you
what
a
girl
like
fanny
french
would
do
if
she
lost
her
head
among
people
of
a
higher
class
then
damerel
must
have
foreseen
it
that
s
just
what
i
say
she
pretended
to
be
a
friend
to
the
girl
on
purpose
to
ruin
have
you
accused
her
of
it
yes
i
his
eyes
flashed
nancy
marvelled
at
this
fire
drawn
from
a
gentle
nature
by
what
seemed
to
her
so
inadequate
so
contemptible
a
cause
of
course
she
denied
it
and
got
angry
with
me
but
any
one
could
see
she
was
glad
of
what
had
happened
there
s
an
end
between
us
at
all
events
i
shall
never
go
to
see
her
again
she
s
a
woman
who
thinks
of
nothing
but
money
and
fashion
i
dislike
her
friends
every
one
of
them
i
ve
met
i
told
her
that
what
she
had
done
ought
to
be
a
punishable
nancy
reflected
then
said
quietly
whether
you
are
right
or
wrong
i
don
t
think
you
would
have
got
any
good
from
her
but
will
you
tell
me
what
you
are
going
to
do
i
told
you
that
i
thought
borrowing
money
only
to
live
on
it
in
idleness
was
very
her
brother
stiffened
his
neck
you
must
allow
me
to
judge
for
but
have
you
judged
for
yourself
wasn
t
it
by
damerel
s
advice
that
you
gave
up
business
partly
but
i
should
have
done
it
in
any
have
you
any
plans
no
i
haven
t
he
answered
you
can
t
expect
a
man
to
have
plans
whose
life
has
been
thoroughly
nancy
reminded
of
his
youthfulness
by
the
tone
in
which
he
called
himself
a
man
experienced
a
revival
of
natural
feeling
though
revolting
against
the
suggestion
that
a
woman
akin
to
them
had
been
guilty
of
what
her
brother
believed
she
was
glad
to
think
that
fanny
french
had
relinquished
all
legitimate
claim
upon
him
and
that
his
connection
with
smart
society
had
come
to
an
end
obvious
enough
were
the
perils
of
his
situation
and
she
as
elder
sister
recognised
a
duty
towards
him
she
softened
her
voice
and
endeavoured
to
the
confidence
of
old
time
impossible
at
once
though
with
resolution
she
might
ultimately
succeed
horace
at
present
was
a
mere
compound
of
agitated
and
inflamed
senses
the
life
he
had
been
leading
appeared
in
a
vicious
development
of
his
previously
harmless
conceit
and
egoism
all
his
characteristics
had
turned
out
as
it
were
the
seamy
side
and
nancy
with
difficulty
preserved
her
patience
as
he
showed
point
after
point
of
perverted
disposition
the
result
of
their
talk
was
a
careless
promise
from
horace
that
he
would
come
to
grove
lane
not
seldomer
than
once
a
week
he
stayed
only
an
hour
resisting
nancy
s
endeavour
to
detain
him
at
least
for
the
meal
to
mary
he
spoke
formally
awkwardly
as
though
unable
to
accept
her
position
in
the
house
and
then
made
his
escape
like
one
driven
by
an
evil
spirit
chapter
with
the
clearing
of
the
sky
nancy
s
spirit
grew
lighter
she
went
about
london
and
enjoyed
it
after
her
long
seclusion
in
the
little
cornish
town
enjoyed
too
her
release
from
manifold
restraints
and
perils
her
mental
suffering
had
made
the
physical
harder
to
bear
she
was
now
recovering
health
of
mind
and
body
and
found
with
surprise
that
life
had
a
new
savour
independent
of
the
timorous
joy
born
with
her
child
strangely
as
it
seemed
to
her
she
grew
conscious
of
a
personal
freedom
not
unlike
what
she
had
vainly
desired
in
the
days
of
petulant
girlhood
the
sense
came
only
at
moments
but
was
real
and
precious
under
its
influence
she
forgot
everything
abnormal
in
her
situation
and
though
without
recognising
this
significance
knew
the
exultation
of
a
woman
who
has
justified
her
being
a
day
or
two
of
roaming
at
large
gave
her
an
appetite
for
activity
satisfied
that
her
child
was
safe
and
well
cared
for
she
turned
her
eyes
upon
the
life
of
the
world
and
wished
to
take
some
part
in
it
not
the
part
she
had
been
wont
to
picture
for
herself
before
reality
supplanted
dreams
horace
s
example
on
the
one
hand
and
that
of
jessica
morgan
on
the
other
helped
her
to
contemn
mere
social
excitement
and
the
idle
vanity
which
formerly
she
styled
pursuit
of
culture
must
there
not
be
discoverable
in
the
world
to
which
she
had
or
could
obtain
access
some
honest
strenuous
occupation
which
would
hold
in
check
her
unprofitable
thoughts
and
soothe
her
that
her
fraud
up
to
and
beyond
the
crucial
point
had
escaped
detection
must
be
held
so
wonderful
that
she
felt
justified
in
an
assurance
of
impunity
the
narrowest
escape
of
which
she
was
aware
had
befallen
only
a
few
weeks
ago
on
the
sixth
day
after
the
birth
of
the
child
there
was
brought
to
her
lodgings
at
falmouth
a
note
addressed
to
miss
letters
bearing
this
address
had
arrived
frequently
and
by
the
people
of
the
house
were
supposed
to
be
for
mary
woodruff
who
went
by
the
name
of
miss
lord
nancy
having
disguised
herself
as
mrs
woodruff
but
they
had
always
come
by
post
and
the
present
missive
must
be
from
some
acquaintance
actually
in
the
town
nancy
could
not
remember
the
handwriting
breaking
open
the
envelope
as
she
lay
in
bed
she
saw
with
alarm
the
signature
luckworth
he
was
at
falmouth
on
business
crewe
wrote
and
before
leaving
london
he
had
ventured
to
ask
miss
lord
s
address
from
her
brother
whom
he
casually
met
somewhere
would
nancy
allow
him
to
see
her
were
it
but
for
a
minute
or
two
earnestly
he
besought
this
favour
he
desired
nothing
more
than
to
see
miss
lord
and
to
speak
with
her
in
the
way
of
an
ordinary
acquaintance
after
all
this
time
she
had
he
felt
sure
forgiven
his
behaviour
at
their
last
meeting
only
five
minutes
of
conversation
all
seemed
lost
nancy
was
silent
in
despair
but
mary
faced
the
perilous
juncture
and
to
all
appearances
averted
catastrophe
she
dressed
herself
and
went
straight
to
the
hotel
where
crewe
had
put
up
and
where
he
awaited
an
answer
having
made
known
who
she
was
she
delivered
a
verbal
message
miss
lord
was
not
well
enough
to
see
any
one
and
in
any
case
she
could
not
have
received
mr
crewe
she
begged
him
to
pardon
her
before
long
they
might
perhaps
meet
in
london
but
for
her
own
part
she
wished
crewe
would
learn
to
regard
her
as
a
stranger
of
course
there
followed
a
dialogue
and
mary
seeming
to
speak
with
all
freedom
convinced
crewe
that
his
attempt
to
gain
an
interview
was
quite
hopeless
she
gave
him
much
information
concerning
her
mistress
none
of
it
false
but
all
misleading
and
in
the
end
had
to
resist
an
offer
of
gold
coins
pressed
upon
her
as
a
bribe
for
her
good
word
with
nancy
the
question
was
had
crewe
been
content
to
leave
falmouth
without
making
inquiries
of
other
people
to
a
man
of
his
experience
nothing
was
easier
than
such
investigation
but
with
other
grounds
of
anxiety
this
had
ceased
to
disturb
nancy
s
mind
practically
she
lived
as
though
all
danger
were
at
an
end
the
task
immediately
before
her
seemed
very
simple
she
had
only
to
resume
the
old
habits
and
guard
against
thoughtless
in
her
everyday
talk
the
chance
that
any
one
would
discover
her
habit
of
visiting
a
certain
house
at
the
distance
of
several
miles
from
camberwell
was
too
slight
for
consideration
she
wrote
to
barmby
senior
informing
him
of
her
return
in
improved
health
to
grove
lane
and
thanking
him
once
more
for
his
allowing
her
to
make
so
long
a
stay
in
cornwall
if
he
wished
to
see
her
she
would
be
at
home
at
any
time
convenient
to
him
in
a
few
days
the
old
gentleman
called
and
for
an
hour
or
two
discoursed
commonplace
he
was
sorry
to
observe
that
she
looked
a
trifle
pale
in
the
autumn
she
must
go
away
again
and
to
a
more
bracing
locality
he
would
suggest
broadstairs
which
had
always
exercised
the
most
beneficial
effect
upon
his
own
health
above
all
he
begged
her
to
refrain
from
excessive
study
most
deleterious
to
a
female
constitution
then
he
asked
questions
about
horace
and
agreed
with
nancy
that
the
young
man
ought
to
decide
upon
some
new
pursuit
if
he
had
definitely
abandoned
the
old
lack
of
steady
occupation
was
most
deleterious
at
his
age
in
short
barmby
rather
apologised
for
his
guardianship
than
sought
to
make
assertion
of
it
and
nancy
by
a
few
feminine
devices
won
a
better
opinion
than
she
had
hitherto
enjoyed
on
the
day
following
samuel
barmby
and
his
sisters
waited
upon
miss
lord
all
three
were
surprisingly
solemn
and
samuel
talked
for
the
most
part
of
a
paragraph
he
had
recently
read
which
stated
that
the
smoke
of
london
if
properly
utilised
would
be
worth
a
vast
sum
of
money
the
english
are
a
wasteful
people
was
his
conclusion
to
which
nancy
assented
with
a
face
as
grave
as
his
own
not
a
little
to
her
astonishment
the
next
day
brought
her
a
long
letter
in
samuel
s
fair
commercial
hand
it
began
by
assuring
her
that
the
writer
had
no
intention
whatever
of
troubling
her
with
the
renewal
of
a
suit
so
firmly
rejected
on
more
than
one
occasion
he
wished
only
to
take
this
opportunity
of
her
return
from
a
long
absence
to
express
the
abiding
nature
of
his
devotion
which
years
hence
would
be
unbroken
as
he
would
never
distress
her
by
unwelcome
demonstrations
possibly
she
might
never
again
hear
from
his
lips
what
he
now
committed
to
paper
enough
for
him
samuel
to
cherish
a
love
which
could
not
but
exalt
and
purify
him
which
was
indeed
in
the
words
of
shakespeare
a
liberal
in
recompense
of
his
he
only
besought
that
miss
lord
would
allow
him
from
time
to
time
to
look
upon
her
face
and
to
converse
with
her
of
intellectual
subjects
a
paper
he
added
which
i
read
last
week
at
our
society
is
now
being
printed
solely
at
the
request
of
friends
the
subject
is
one
that
may
interest
you
the
influence
of
culture
on
i
beg
that
you
will
accept
the
copy
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
sending
you
and
that
at
some
future
date
you
will
honour
me
with
your
remarks
which
epistle
nancy
cruelly
read
aloud
to
mary
with
a
sprightliness
and
sarcastic
humour
not
excelled
by
her
criticisms
of
the
prophet
in
days
gone
by
mary
did
not
quite
understand
but
she
saw
in
this
behaviour
a
proof
of
the
wonderful
courage
with
which
nancy
faced
her
troubles
a
week
had
passed
and
no
news
from
america
i
don
t
care
said
nancy
really
and
truly
i
don
t
care
yesterday
i
never
once
thought
of
it
never
once
looked
for
the
postman
the
worst
is
over
now
and
he
may
write
or
not
as
he
mary
felt
sure
there
would
be
an
explanation
of
such
strange
silence
only
illness
or
death
would
explain
it
so
as
to
make
me
forgive
him
but
he
isn
t
ill
he
is
alive
and
enjoying
there
was
no
bitterness
in
her
voice
she
seemed
to
have
outlived
all
sorrows
and
anxieties
relative
to
her
husband
mary
suggested
that
it
was
always
possible
to
call
at
vawdrey
s
house
and
make
inquiries
of
baker
no
i
won
t
do
that
other
women
would
do
it
but
i
won
t
so
long
as
i
mayn
t
tell
the
truth
i
should
only
set
them
talking
about
me
you
know
how
i
see
the
use
now
of
having
a
good
deal
of
pride
i
m
only
sorry
for
those
letters
i
wrote
when
i
wasn
t
in
my
senses
if
he
writes
now
i
shall
not
answer
he
shall
know
that
i
am
as
independent
as
he
is
what
a
blessed
thing
it
is
for
a
woman
to
have
money
of
her
own
it
s
because
most
women
haven
t
that
they
re
such
poor
wretched
if
he
knew
you
were
in
want
said
her
companion
he
would
never
have
behaved
like
who
can
say
no
i
won
t
pretend
to
think
worse
of
him
than
i
do
you
re
quite
right
he
wouldn
t
leave
his
wife
to
starve
it
s
certain
that
he
hears
about
me
from
some
one
if
i
were
found
out
and
lost
everything
some
one
would
let
him
know
but
i
wouldn
t
accept
support
from
him
now
he
might
provide
for
his
child
but
he
shall
never
provide
for
me
come
what
may
never
it
was
in
the
evening
after
dinner
nancy
had
a
newspaper
and
was
reading
the
advertisements
that
offered
miscellaneous
employment
what
do
you
think
this
can
be
she
asked
looking
up
after
a
long
silence
to
ladies
with
leisure
ladies
desiring
to
add
to
their
income
by
easy
and
pleasant
work
should
write
i
ve
no
faith
in
those
kind
of
advertisements
said
mary
no
of
course
it
s
rubbish
there
s
no
easy
and
pleasant
way
of
earning
money
only
silly
people
expect
it
and
i
don
t
want
anything
easy
or
pleasant
i
want
honest
hard
work
not
work
with
my
hands
i
m
not
suited
for
that
but
real
work
such
as
lots
of
educated
girls
are
doing
i
m
quite
willing
to
pay
for
learning
it
most
likely
i
shall
have
to
who
could
i
write
to
for
advice
they
were
sitting
upstairs
and
so
did
not
hear
a
visitor
s
knock
that
sounded
at
the
front
door
the
servant
came
and
announced
that
miss
french
wished
to
see
miss
lord
miss
french
is
it
the
younger
miss
french
the
girl
could
not
say
she
had
repeated
the
name
given
to
her
nancy
spoke
to
her
friend
in
a
low
voice
it
may
be
fanny
i
don
t
think
beatrice
would
call
unless
it
s
to
say
something
about
her
sister
she
had
better
come
up
here
i
suppose
mary
retired
and
in
a
few
moments
there
entered
not
fanny
but
beatrice
she
was
civilly
not
cordially
welcomed
her
eye
as
she
spoke
the
words
natural
at
such
a
meeting
dwelt
with
singular
persistency
on
nancy
s
face
you
are
quite
well
again
quite
thank
it
has
been
a
troublesome
illness
i
m
nancy
hesitated
detecting
a
peculiarity
of
look
and
tone
which
caused
her
uneasiness
i
had
a
sort
of
low
fever
was
altogether
out
of
sorts
below
par
the
doctor
said
are
you
all
well
settling
herself
comfortably
as
if
for
a
long
chat
beatrice
sketched
with
some
humour
the
course
of
recent
events
in
de
crespigny
park
i
m
out
of
it
all
thank
goodness
i
prefer
a
quiet
life
then
there
s
fanny
you
know
all
about
i
dare
say
nothing
at
all
nancy
replied
distantly
but
your
brother
does
hasn
t
he
been
to
see
you
yet
nancy
was
in
no
mood
to
submit
to
examination
whatever
i
may
have
heard
i
know
nothing
about
fanny
s
affairs
and
really
they
don
t
concern
me
i
should
have
thought
they
might
rejoined
the
other
smiling
absently
she
has
run
away
from
her
friends
a
pause
and
is
living
somewhere
rather
mysteriously
another
pause
and
i
think
it
more
than
likely
that
she
s
the
listener
preserved
a
face
of
indifference
though
the
lines
were
decidedly
tense
doesn
t
that
interest
you
asked
beatrice
in
the
most
genial
tone
if
it
s
true
was
the
blunt
reply
you
mean
you
are
glad
if
she
has
married
somebody
else
and
not
your
brother
yes
i
am
glad
of
beatrice
mused
with
wrinkles
at
the
corner
of
her
eye
then
fixing
nancy
with
a
very
keen
look
she
said
quietly
i
m
not
sure
that
she
s
married
but
if
she
isn
t
no
doubt
she
ought
to
on
nancy
s
part
there
was
a
nervous
movement
but
she
said
nothing
her
face
grew
rigid
i
have
an
idea
who
the
man
is
miss
french
pursued
but
i
can
t
be
quite
certain
one
has
heard
of
similar
cases
even
have
no
doubt
i
don
t
care
to
talk
about
it
fell
mechanically
from
nancy
s
lips
which
had
lost
their
colour
but
i
ve
come
just
for
that
the
eyes
of
mocking
scrutiny
would
not
be
resisted
they
drew
a
gaze
from
nancy
and
then
a
haughty
exclamation
i
don
t
understand
you
please
say
whatever
you
have
to
say
in
plain
don
t
be
angry
with
me
you
were
always
too
ready
at
taking
offence
i
mean
it
in
quite
a
friendly
way
you
can
trust
me
i
m
not
one
of
the
women
that
chatter
don
t
you
think
you
ought
to
sympathise
a
little
with
fanny
she
has
gone
to
brussels
or
somewhere
about
there
but
she
have
gone
down
into
cornwall
to
a
place
like
falmouth
it
was
quite
far
enough
off
don
t
you
think
nancy
was
stricken
mute
and
her
countenance
would
no
longer
disguise
what
she
suffered
no
need
to
upset
yourself
pursued
the
other
in
smiling
confidence
i
mean
no
harm
i
m
curious
that
s
all
just
want
to
know
one
or
two
things
we
re
old
friends
and
whatever
you
tell
me
will
go
no
further
depend
upon
what
do
you
mean
the
words
came
from
lips
that
moved
with
difficulty
beatrice
still
smiling
bent
forward
is
it
any
one
that
i
know
any
one
who
that
made
it
necessary
for
you
to
go
down
into
cornwall
my
nancy
heaved
a
sigh
the
result
of
holding
her
breath
too
long
she
half
rose
and
sat
down
again
in
a
torture
of
flashing
thoughts
she
tried
to
determine
whether
beatrice
had
any
information
or
spoke
conjecturally
yet
she
was
able
to
discern
that
either
case
meant
disaster
to
have
excited
the
suspicions
of
such
a
person
was
the
same
as
being
unmasked
an
inquiry
at
falmouth
and
all
would
at
once
be
known
no
not
all
not
the
fact
of
her
marriage
not
the
name
of
her
husband
driven
to
bay
by
such
an
opponent
she
assumed
an
air
wholly
unnatural
to
her
one
of
cynical
effrontery
you
had
better
say
what
you
all
right
who
was
the
father
of
the
child
born
not
long
ago
that
s
asking
a
and
telling
what
i
know
at
the
same
time
it
saves
beatrice
laughed
and
nancy
become
a
mere
automaton
laughed
too
that
s
more
like
it
said
miss
french
cheerfully
now
we
shall
get
on
together
it
s
very
shocking
my
dear
a
person
of
my
strict
morality
hardly
knows
how
to
look
you
in
the
face
perhaps
you
had
rather
i
didn
t
try
very
well
now
tell
me
all
about
it
comfortably
i
have
a
guess
you
what
is
it
wait
a
little
i
don
t
want
to
be
laughed
at
is
it
any
one
i
know
you
have
never
seen
him
and
i
dare
say
never
heard
of
beatrice
stared
incredulously
i
wouldn
t
tell
fibs
i
m
telling
the
it
s
very
queer
who
did
you
think
the
speaking
automaton
as
though
by
defect
of
mechanism
stopped
short
look
straight
at
me
i
shouldn
t
have
been
surprised
to
hear
that
it
was
luckworth
nancy
s
defiant
gaze
shame
in
anguish
shielding
itself
with
the
front
of
audacity
changed
to
utter
astonishment
the
blood
rushed
back
into
her
cheeks
she
voiced
a
smothered
exclamation
of
scorn
the
father
of
my
child
luckworth
crewe
i
thought
it
not
impossible
said
beatrice
plainly
baffled
it
was
like
nancy
gave
a
hard
laugh
you
judged
me
by
yourself
have
another
guess
surprised
both
at
the
denial
so
obviously
true
and
at
the
unexpected
tone
with
which
nancy
was
meeting
her
attack
miss
french
sat
meditative
it
s
no
use
guessing
she
said
at
length
with
complete
i
don
t
know
of
any
one
very
well
you
can
t
expect
me
to
tell
as
you
please
it
s
a
queer
thing
i
felt
pretty
sure
but
if
you
re
telling
the
truth
i
don
t
care
a
rap
who
the
man
you
can
rest
in
peace
said
nancy
with
careless
scorn
any
way
of
convincing
me
except
by
saying
it
yes
wait
here
a
she
left
the
room
and
returned
with
the
note
which
crewe
had
addressed
to
her
from
the
hotel
at
falmouth
read
that
and
look
at
the
beatrice
studied
the
document
and
in
silence
canvassed
the
possibilities
of
trickery
no
it
was
genuine
evidence
she
remembered
the
date
of
crewe
s
journey
to
falmouth
and
in
this
new
light
could
interpret
his
quarrelsome
behaviour
after
he
had
returned
only
the
discovery
she
had
since
made
inflamed
her
with
a
suspicion
which
till
then
had
never
entered
her
mind
of
course
you
didn
t
let
him
see
you
of
course
all
right
don
t
suppose
i
wanted
to
insult
you
i
took
it
for
granted
you
were
married
of
course
it
happened
before
your
father
s
death
and
his
awkward
will
obliged
you
to
keep
it
dark
again
nancy
was
smitten
with
fear
deeming
miss
french
an
unscrupulous
enemy
she
felt
that
to
confess
marriage
was
to
abandon
every
hope
pride
appealed
to
her
courage
bade
her
here
and
now
have
done
with
the
ignoble
fraud
but
fear
proved
stronger
she
could
not
face
exposure
and
all
that
must
follow
she
spoke
coldly
but
with
eyes
i
am
not
the
words
cost
her
little
effort
practically
she
had
uttered
them
before
her
overbold
replies
were
an
admission
of
what
from
the
first
she
supposed
beatrice
to
charge
her
with
not
secret
wedlock
but
secret
shame
beatrice
however
had
adopted
that
line
of
suggestion
merely
from
policy
hoping
to
sting
the
proud
girl
into
avowal
of
a
legitimate
union
she
heard
the
contrary
declaration
with
fresh
surprise
i
should
never
have
believed
it
of
miss
lord
was
her
half
ingenuous
half
sly
comment
nancy
beginning
to
realise
what
she
had
done
sat
with
head
bent
speechless
don
t
distress
yourself
continued
the
other
not
a
soul
will
hear
of
it
from
me
if
you
like
to
tell
me
more
you
can
do
it
quite
safely
i
m
no
blabber
and
i
m
not
a
rascal
i
should
never
have
troubled
to
make
inquiries
about
you
down
yonder
if
it
hadn
t
been
that
i
suspected
crewe
that
s
a
confession
you
know
take
it
in
return
for
nancy
was
a
full
sense
of
her
humiliation
had
burst
upon
her
she
who
always
condescended
to
miss
french
now
lay
smirched
before
her
feet
an
object
of
vulgar
contempt
what
does
it
matter
went
on
beatrice
genially
you
ve
got
over
the
worst
and
very
cleverly
are
you
going
to
marry
him
when
you
come
in
for
your
money
perhaps
i
don
t
know
she
faltered
no
longer
able
to
mask
in
impudence
and
hardly
restraining
tears
beatrice
ceased
to
doubt
and
could
only
wonder
with
amusement
why
shouldn
t
we
be
good
friends
nancy
i
tell
you
i
am
no
rascal
i
never
thought
of
making
anything
out
of
your
secret
not
i
if
it
had
been
crewe
marriage
or
no
marriage
well
i
might
have
shown
my
temper
i
believe
i
have
a
pretty
rough
side
to
my
tongue
but
i
m
a
good
enough
sort
if
you
take
me
in
the
right
way
of
course
i
shall
never
rest
for
wondering
who
it
can
be
she
paused
but
nancy
did
not
look
up
did
not
stir
perhaps
you
ll
tell
me
some
other
time
but
there
s
one
thing
i
should
like
to
ask
about
and
it
s
for
your
own
good
that
i
should
know
it
when
crewe
was
down
there
don
t
you
think
he
tumbled
to
anything
perplexed
by
unfamiliar
slang
nancy
raised
her
eyes
found
out
anything
you
mean
i
don
t
but
you
must
have
been
in
a
jolly
fright
about
it
i
gave
it
very
little
thought
replied
nancy
able
now
to
command
a
steady
voice
and
retiring
behind
a
manner
of
frigid
indifference
no
well
of
course
i
understand
that
better
now
i
know
that
you
can
t
lose
anything
still
it
is
to
be
hoped
he
didn
t
go
asking
questions
you
may
as
well
just
tell
me
he
has
asked
you
to
marry
him
hasn
t
he
beatrice
nodded
doesn
t
matter
you
needn
t
be
afraid
even
if
he
got
hold
of
anything
he
isn
t
the
kind
of
man
to
injure
you
out
of
i
fear
him
as
little
as
i
fear
well
as
i
ve
told
you
you
needn
t
fear
me
at
all
i
like
you
better
for
this
a
good
deal
better
than
i
used
to
if
you
want
any
help
you
know
where
to
turn
i
ll
do
whatever
i
can
for
you
and
i
m
in
the
way
of
being
useful
to
my
friends
you
re
cut
up
just
now
it
s
natural
i
won
t
bother
you
any
longer
but
just
remember
what
i
ve
said
if
i
can
be
of
any
service
don
t
be
above
making
use
of
nancy
heard
without
heeding
for
an
anguish
of
shame
and
misery
once
more
fell
upon
her
and
seemed
to
lay
waste
her
soul
part
v
compassed
round
chapter
there
needed
not
mary
woodruff
s
suggestion
to
remind
nancy
that
no
further
away
than
champion
hill
were
people
of
whom
in
extremity
she
might
inquire
concerning
her
husband
at
present
even
could
she
have
entertained
the
thought
it
seemed
doubtful
whether
the
vawdrey
household
knew
more
of
tarrant
s
position
and
purposes
than
she
herself
for
only
a
month
ago
jessica
morgan
had
called
upon
the
girls
and
had
ventured
a
question
about
their
cousin
whereupon
they
answered
that
he
was
in
america
but
that
he
had
not
written
for
a
long
time
to
baker
jessica
did
not
like
to
speak
on
the
subject
but
probably
that
lady
could
have
answered
only
as
the
children
did
once
indeed
a
few
days
after
her
return
nancy
took
the
familiar
walk
along
champion
hill
and
glanced
in
passing
at
vawdrey
s
house
afterwards
she
shunned
that
region
the
memories
it
revived
were
infinitely
painful
she
saw
herself
an
immature
and
foolish
girl
behaving
in
a
way
which
for
all
its
affectation
of
reserve
and
dignity
no
doubt
offered
to
such
a
man
as
lionel
tarrant
a
hint
that
here
if
he
chose
he
might
make
a
facile
conquest
had
he
not
acted
upon
the
hint
it
wrung
her
heart
with
shame
to
remember
how
in
those
days
she
followed
the
lure
of
a
crude
imagination
a
year
ago
oh
a
lifetime
unwilling
now
to
justify
herself
with
the
plea
of
love
doubtful
in
very
truth
whether
her
passion
merited
that
name
she
looked
back
in
the
stern
spirit
of
a
woman
judging
another
s
frailty
what
treatment
could
she
have
anticipated
at
the
hands
of
her
lover
save
that
she
had
received
he
married
her
it
was
much
he
forsook
her
it
was
natural
the
truth
of
which
she
had
caught
troublous
glimpses
in
the
heyday
of
her
folly
now
stood
revealed
as
pitiless
condemnation
tarrant
never
respected
her
never
thought
of
her
as
a
woman
whom
he
could
seriously
woo
and
she
had
a
certain
power
over
his
emotions
and
not
the
sensual
alone
but
his
love
would
not
endure
the
test
of
absence
from
the
other
side
of
the
atlantic
he
saw
her
as
he
had
seen
her
at
first
and
shrank
from
returning
to
the
bondage
which
in
a
weak
moment
he
had
accepted
one
night
about
this
time
she
said
to
herself
i
was
his
mistress
never
his
and
all
her
desperate
endeavours
to
obscure
the
history
of
their
love
to
assert
herself
as
worthy
to
be
called
wife
mother
had
fallen
fruitless
those
long
imploring
letters
despatched
to
america
from
her
solitude
by
the
cornish
sea
elicited
nothing
but
a
word
or
two
which
sounded
more
like
pity
than
affection
pity
does
not
suffice
to
recall
the
wandering
steps
of
a
man
wedded
against
his
will
in
her
heart
she
absolved
him
of
all
baseness
the
man
of
ignoble
thought
would
have
been
influenced
by
her
market
value
as
a
wife
tarrant
all
the
more
because
he
was
reduced
to
poverty
would
resolutely
forget
the
crude
advantage
of
remaining
faithful
to
her
herein
nancy
proved
herself
more
akin
to
her
father
than
she
had
ever
seemed
when
stephen
lord
sought
eagerly
in
her
character
for
hopeful
traits
the
severity
of
her
and
the
indulgence
tempering
her
attitude
towards
tarrant
declared
a
love
which
had
survived
its
phase
of
youthful
passion
but
nancy
did
not
recognise
this
symptom
of
moral
growth
she
believed
herself
to
have
become
indifferent
to
her
husband
and
only
wondered
that
she
did
not
hate
him
her
heart
seemed
to
spend
all
its
emotion
on
the
little
being
to
whom
she
had
given
life
a
healthy
boy
who
already
so
she
fancied
knew
a
difference
between
his
mother
and
his
nurse
and
gurgled
a
peculiar
note
of
contentment
when
lying
in
her
arms
whether
wife
or
not
she
claimed
every
privilege
of
motherhood
had
the
child
been
a
weakling
she
could
not
have
known
this
abounding
solace
the
defect
would
have
reproached
her
but
from
the
day
of
his
birth
he
manifested
so
vigorous
a
will
to
live
clung
so
hungrily
to
the
kicked
and
clamoured
with
such
irresistible
that
the
mother
s
pride
equalled
her
tenderness
my
own
brave
boy
my
son
wonderful
new
words
honey
upon
the
lips
and
rapture
to
the
ear
she
murmured
them
as
though
inspired
with
speech
never
uttered
by
mortal
the
interval
of
a
day
between
her
journeys
to
see
the
child
taxed
her
patience
but
each
visit
brought
a
growth
of
confidence
no
harm
would
befall
him
mary
had
chosen
wisely
horace
kept
aloof
and
sent
no
message
when
at
length
she
wrote
to
him
a
letter
all
of
sisterly
kindness
there
came
a
stinted
reply
he
said
that
he
was
going
away
for
a
holiday
and
might
be
absent
until
september
don
t
bother
about
me
you
shall
hear
again
before
long
there
s
just
a
chance
that
i
may
go
in
for
business
again
with
prospect
of
making
money
particulars
when
i
see
nancy
found
this
note
awaiting
her
after
a
day
s
absence
from
home
and
with
it
another
to
her
surprise
damerel
had
written
i
called
early
this
afternoon
wishing
particularly
to
see
you
will
you
please
let
me
know
when
i
should
find
you
at
home
it
is
about
horace
that
i
want
to
it
began
with
my
dear
nancy
and
ended
yours
glad
of
the
opportunity
thus
offered
she
answered
at
once
making
an
appointment
for
the
next
day
when
damerel
came
nancy
was
even
more
struck
than
at
their
former
meeting
with
her
resemblance
to
horace
eyes
and
lips
recalled
horace
at
every
moment
this
time
the
conversation
began
more
smoothly
on
both
sides
appeared
a
disposition
to
friendliness
though
nancy
only
marked
her
distrust
in
the
hope
of
learning
more
about
this
mysterious
relative
and
of
being
useful
to
her
brother
you
have
a
prejudice
against
me
said
the
visitor
when
she
had
inquired
concerning
nancy
s
health
it
s
only
natural
i
hardly
seem
to
you
a
real
relative
i
m
afraid
you
know
so
little
about
me
and
now
horace
has
been
laying
dreadful
things
to
my
he
thinks
you
responsible
for
what
has
happened
to
fanny
french
nancy
replied
in
an
impartial
voice
yes
and
i
assure
you
he
is
mistaken
miss
french
deceived
him
and
her
own
people
leading
them
to
think
that
she
was
spending
her
time
with
me
when
really
she
was
who
knows
where
to
you
i
am
quite
ready
to
confess
that
i
hoped
something
might
come
between
her
and
horace
but
as
for
plotting
really
lam
not
so
melodramatic
a
person
all
i
did
in
the
way
of
design
was
to
give
horace
an
opportunity
of
seeing
the
girl
in
a
new
light
you
can
imagine
very
well
no
doubt
how
she
conducted
herself
i
quite
believe
that
horace
was
getting
tired
and
ashamed
of
her
but
then
came
her
disappearance
and
that
made
him
angry
with
even
the
voice
suggested
horace
s
tones
especially
when
softened
in
familiar
dialogue
nancy
paid
closer
attention
to
the
speaker
s
looks
and
movements
than
to
the
matter
of
what
she
said
damerel
might
possibly
be
a
woman
her
peculiarities
might
result
from
social
habits
and
not
from
insincerity
yet
nancy
could
not
like
her
everything
about
her
prompted
a
question
and
a
doubt
how
old
was
she
probably
much
older
than
she
looked
what
was
her
breeding
her
education
probably
far
less
thorough
than
she
would
have
one
believe
was
she
in
good
circumstances
nancy
suspected
that
her
fashionable
and
expensive
dress
signified
extravagance
and
vanity
rather
than
wealth
i
have
brought
a
letter
to
show
you
which
she
has
sent
me
from
abroad
read
it
and
form
your
own
conclusion
is
it
the
letter
of
an
injured
innocent
a
scrawl
on
foreign
which
ran
thus
dear
mrs
damerel
just
a
word
to
console
you
for
the
loss
of
my
society
i
have
gone
to
a
better
world
so
dry
your
tears
if
you
see
my
masher
tell
him
i
ve
met
with
somebody
a
bit
more
like
a
man
i
should
advise
him
to
go
to
school
again
and
finish
his
education
i
won
t
trouble
you
to
write
many
thanks
for
the
kindness
you
mean
to
do
yours
in
the
best
of
spirits
i
don
t
mean
cognac
fanny
french
nancy
returned
the
paper
with
a
look
of
disgust
saying
i
didn
t
think
she
was
as
bad
as
no
more
did
i
it
really
gave
me
a
little
shock
of
do
you
think
it
likely
she
is
married
damerel
pursed
her
lips
and
arched
her
eyebrows
with
so
unpleasant
an
effect
on
nancy
that
she
looked
away
i
have
no
means
whatever
of
forming
an
but
there
s
no
more
fear
for
horace
said
nancy
i
hope
not
i
think
not
but
my
purpose
in
coming
was
to
consult
with
you
about
the
poor
boy
he
has
renounced
me
he
won
t
answer
my
letters
and
i
am
so
dreadfully
afraid
that
a
sort
of
despair
it
sounds
ridiculous
but
he
is
so
very
young
may
drive
him
into
reckless
living
you
have
taken
part
with
him
against
me
i
fear
no
i
haven
t
i
told
him
i
was
quite
sure
the
girl
had
only
herself
to
blame
whatever
how
kind
of
you
damerel
sank
her
voice
to
a
sort
of
cooing
not
unmelodious
but
to
nancy
s
ear
a
hollow
affectation
if
we
could
understand
each
other
i
am
so
anxious
for
your
dear
brother
s
happiness
and
for
yours
believe
me
i
have
suffered
greatly
since
he
told
me
i
was
his
enemy
and
cast
me
here
sounded
a
note
of
pathos
which
impressed
the
critical
listener
there
was
a
look
too
in
damerel
s
eyes
quite
unlike
any
that
nancy
had
yet
detected
what
do
you
wish
him
to
do
she
asked
if
i
must
tell
you
the
truth
i
don
t
think
he
ll
get
any
good
in
the
life
of
society
s
representative
answered
in
a
tone
of
affectionate
frankness
he
won
t
i
can
see
that
i
don
t
wish
him
to
live
idly
the
question
is
what
ought
he
to
do
i
think
you
know
a
gentleman
of
his
acquaintance
crewe
the
question
was
added
rather
abruptly
and
with
a
watchful
gaze
i
know
him
a
something
has
been
said
i
believe
about
horace
investing
money
in
crewe
s
business
do
you
think
it
would
be
advisable
surprise
kept
nancy
silent
is
crewe
trustworthy
i
understand
he
has
been
in
business
for
himself
only
a
short
nancy
declared
herself
unable
to
judge
crewe
whether
in
private
or
in
commercial
life
and
here
she
paused
but
could
not
refrain
from
adding
the
question
whether
damerel
had
personal
knowledge
of
him
i
have
met
him
immediately
all
nancy
s
suspicions
were
revived
she
had
felt
a
desire
to
talk
of
intimate
things
with
mention
of
her
mother
s
name
but
the
repulsion
excited
in
her
by
this
woman
s
air
of
subtlety
by
looks
movements
tones
which
she
did
not
understand
forbade
it
she
could
not
speak
with
satisfaction
even
of
horace
feeling
that
damerel
s
affection
however
genuine
must
needs
be
baleful
from
this
point
her
part
in
the
dialogue
was
slight
if
any
of
miss
french
s
relatives
said
the
visitor
presently
should
accuse
me
to
you
you
will
be
able
to
contradict
them
i
am
sure
i
can
depend
upon
you
for
that
service
i
am
not
likely
to
see
them
and
i
should
have
thought
you
would
care
very
little
what
was
said
about
you
by
people
of
that
i
care
little
enough
rejoined
damerel
with
a
curl
of
the
lips
it
s
horace
i
am
thinking
of
these
people
will
embitter
him
against
me
so
long
as
they
have
any
ground
to
go
but
haven
t
you
let
him
know
of
that
letter
damerel
seemed
to
fall
into
abstraction
answered
with
a
vague
yes
and
after
surveying
the
room
said
softly
so
you
must
live
here
alone
for
another
two
or
three
years
it
isn
t
compulsory
it
s
only
a
another
vague
then
i
do
so
wish
horace
would
come
back
and
make
his
home
i
m
afraid
you
have
spoilt
him
for
that
said
nancy
with
relief
in
this
piece
of
plain
speaking
damerel
did
not
openly
resent
it
she
looked
a
mild
surprise
and
answered
blandly
then
i
must
undo
the
mischief
you
shall
help
me
when
he
has
got
over
this
little
trouble
he
will
see
who
are
his
true
friends
let
us
work
together
for
his
nancy
was
inclined
once
more
to
reproach
herself
and
listened
with
patience
whilst
her
relative
continued
talking
in
grave
kindly
tones
lest
she
should
spoil
the
effect
of
these
impressive
remarks
damerel
then
took
leave
in
shaking
hands
she
bent
upon
the
girl
a
gaze
of
affection
and
as
she
turned
away
softly
sighed
of
what
had
passed
in
the
recent
interview
with
beatrice
french
nancy
said
nothing
to
her
faithful
companion
this
burden
of
shame
must
be
borne
by
herself
alone
it
affected
profoundly
the
courageous
mood
which
had
promised
to
make
her
life
tolerable
henceforth
she
all
but
abandoned
the
hope
of
gaining
that
end
for
which
she
had
submitted
to
so
deep
a
humiliation
through
beatrice
would
not
her
secret
coloured
shamefully
become
known
to
luckworth
crewe
and
to
others
already
perchance
a
growing
scandal
attached
to
her
name
fear
had
enabled
her
to
endure
dishonour
in
the
eyes
of
one
woman
but
at
any
moment
the
disgrace
might
front
her
in
an
intolerable
shape
then
regardless
of
the
cost
she
would
proclaim
her
marriage
and
have
in
return
for
all
she
had
suffered
nothing
but
the
reproach
of
an
attempted
fraud
to
find
employment
means
of
honourable
support
was
an
urgent
necessity
she
had
written
in
reply
to
sundry
advertisements
but
without
result
she
tried
to
draw
up
an
advertisement
on
her
own
account
but
found
the
difficulty
insuperable
what
was
there
she
could
do
teach
children
perhaps
but
as
a
visiting
governess
the
only
position
of
the
kind
which
circumstances
left
open
to
her
she
could
hope
for
nothing
more
than
the
paltriest
remuneration
be
somebody
s
secretary
that
sounded
pleasant
but
very
ambitious
a
sense
of
incompetency
chilled
her
in
an
office
in
a
shop
who
would
dream
of
giving
her
an
engagement
walking
about
the
streets
of
london
in
search
of
suggestions
she
gained
only
an
understanding
of
her
insignificance
in
the
battle
of
life
every
girl
who
could
work
a
or
make
a
matchbox
was
of
more
account
than
she
if
she
entered
a
shop
to
make
purchases
the
young
women
at
the
counter
seemed
to
smile
superiority
of
what
avail
her
education
her
culture
the
roar
of
myriad
industries
made
mocking
laughter
at
such
futile
pretensions
she
shrank
back
into
her
suburban
home
a
little
book
on
employments
for
women
which
she
saw
advertised
and
bought
merely
heightened
her
discouragement
here
doubtless
were
occupations
she
might
learn
but
when
it
came
to
choosing
and
contemplating
the
practical
steps
that
must
be
taken
her
heart
sank
she
was
a
coward
she
dreaded
the
world
she
saw
as
never
yet
the
blessedness
of
having
money
and
a
secure
home
the
word
home
grew
very
sweet
to
her
ears
a
man
she
said
to
herself
may
go
forth
and
find
his
work
his
pleasure
in
the
highways
but
is
not
a
woman
s
place
under
the
sheltering
roof
what
right
had
a
mother
to
be
searching
abroad
for
tasks
and
duties
task
enough
duty
obvious
in
the
tending
of
her
child
had
she
but
a
little
country
cottage
with
needs
assured
and
her
baby
cradled
beside
her
she
would
ask
no
more
how
idle
all
the
thoughts
of
her
girlhood
how
little
she
knew
of
life
as
it
would
reveal
itself
to
her
mature
eyes
fatigued
into
listlessness
she
went
to
the
and
chose
a
novel
for
an
hour
s
amusement
it
happened
that
this
story
was
concerned
with
the
fortunes
of
a
young
woman
who
after
many
an
affliction
sore
discovered
with
notable
suddenness
the
path
to
fame
lucre
and
the
husband
of
her
heart
she
became
at
a
bound
a
successful
novelist
nancy
s
cheek
flushed
with
a
splendid
thought
why
should
not
do
likewise
at
all
events
for
modesty
was
now
her
ruling
characteristic
why
should
she
not
earn
a
little
money
by
writing
stories
numbers
of
women
took
to
it
not
a
few
succeeded
it
was
a
pursuit
that
demanded
no
apprenticeship
that
could
be
followed
in
the
privacy
of
home
a
pursuit
wherein
her
education
would
be
of
service
with
imagination
already
fired
by
the
optimistic
author
she
began
to
walk
about
the
room
and
devise
romantic
incidents
a
love
story
of
course
and
why
not
one
very
like
her
own
the
characters
were
ready
to
her
hands
she
would
begin
this
very
evening
mary
saw
the
glow
upon
her
face
the
delightful
frenzy
in
her
eyes
and
wondered
i
have
an
idea
said
nancy
don
t
ask
me
about
it
just
leave
me
alone
i
think
i
see
my
daily
she
secluded
herself
for
several
hours
and
whatever
the
literary
value
of
her
labour
it
plainly
kept
her
in
good
spirits
and
benefited
her
health
save
for
the
visits
to
her
baby
regular
as
before
she
hardly
left
home
jessica
morgan
came
very
often
much
oftener
than
nancy
desired
not
only
was
her
talk
wearisome
but
it
consumed
valuable
time
she
much
desired
to
see
the
baby
and
nancy
found
it
difficult
to
invent
excuses
for
her
unwillingness
when
importunity
could
not
be
otherwise
defeated
she
pretended
a
conscientious
scruple
i
have
deceived
my
husband
in
telling
him
that
no
one
knows
of
our
marriage
but
mary
if
i
let
you
see
the
child
i
should
feel
that
i
was
deceiving
him
again
don
t
ask
me
i
can
not
unnaturally
this
struck
jessica
as
she
argued
against
it
and
became
petulant
nancy
lost
patience
but
remembered
in
time
that
she
was
at
jessica
s
mercy
and
to
her
mortification
had
to
adopt
a
coaxing
almost
a
suppliant
tone
with
the
result
that
miss
morgan
s
overweening
conceit
was
flattered
into
arrogance
her
sentimental
protestations
became
strangely
mixed
with
a
very
galling
to
nancy
s
pride
without
the
slightest
apparent
cause
for
she
said
one
day
i
do
feel
sorry
for
you
it
must
be
a
dreadful
thing
to
have
married
a
man
who
has
no
sense
of
nancy
fired
up
what
do
you
mean
how
can
he
have
when
he
makes
you
deceive
people
in
this
way
for
the
sake
of
the
money
he
ll
get
he
doesn
t
it
s
my
own
then
he
oughtn
t
let
you
do
it
no
honourable
man
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
you
nancy
exclaimed
anger
blanching
her
cheek
please
don
t
talk
about
my
husband
you
say
things
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
oh
don
t
be
angry
the
facile
tears
started
in
jessica
s
eyes
it
s
because
i
feel
indignant
on
your
account
i
don
t
want
your
indignation
never
mention
this
subject
again
or
i
shall
feel
sure
you
do
it
on
purpose
to
annoy
jessica
melted
into
mawkishness
none
the
less
nancy
felt
a
slave
to
her
former
friend
who
for
whatever
reason
seemed
to
have
grown
hypocritical
and
spiteful
when
next
the
girl
called
she
was
told
that
miss
lord
had
left
home
for
the
day
a
fiction
which
spared
nancy
an
hour
s
torment
miss
morgan
made
up
for
it
by
coming
very
early
on
the
next
sunday
afternoon
and
preparing
herself
avowedly
for
a
stay
until
late
in
the
evening
resolute
to
avoid
a
long
which
was
sure
to
exasperate
her
temper
nancy
kept
mary
in
the
room
and
listened
to
no
hint
from
jessica
that
they
should
retire
for
the
accustomed
privacy
at
four
o
clock
they
were
joined
by
samuel
barmby
whom
for
once
nancy
welcomed
with
pleasure
samuel
who
had
come
in
the
hope
of
finding
miss
lord
alone
gave
but
the
coldest
attention
to
jessica
mary
however
he
greeted
with
grave
courtesy
addressing
to
her
several
remarks
which
were
meant
as
a
recognition
of
social
equality
in
the
quondam
servant
he
was
dressed
with
elaborate
care
snowy
cuffs
concealed
half
his
hands
his
moustache
of
late
in
training
sketched
the
graceful
curl
it
would
presently
achieve
a
faint
perfume
attended
the
drawing
forth
of
his
silk
handkerchief
samuel
never
lacked
a
subject
for
the
display
of
eloquence
today
it
was
one
that
called
for
indignant
fervour
a
most
disgraceful
fact
has
come
under
my
notice
and
i
am
sorry
to
say
miss
lord
that
it
concerns
some
one
with
whom
you
are
indeed
said
nancy
not
without
tremor
who
is
that
mr
peachey
of
de
crespigny
park
i
believe
you
are
on
terms
of
friendship
with
the
oh
you
can
hardly
call
it
friendship
i
know
then
i
may
speak
without
fear
of
paining
you
you
are
aware
that
mr
peachey
is
a
member
of
the
firm
of
ducker
blunt
who
manufacture
disinfectants
now
if
any
manufacture
should
be
carried
on
in
a
conscientious
spirit
as
of
course
manufactures
should
surely
it
is
that
of
disinfectants
only
think
what
depends
upon
it
people
who
make
disinfectants
ought
to
regard
themselves
as
invested
with
a
sacred
trust
the
whole
community
looks
to
them
for
protection
against
disease
the
abuse
of
such
confidence
can
not
be
too
severely
condemned
all
the
more
so
that
there
is
absolutely
no
legal
remedy
against
the
adulteration
of
disinfectants
did
you
know
that
miss
lord
the
law
guards
against
adulteration
of
food
but
it
seems
i
have
been
making
inquiry
into
the
matter
that
no
thought
has
ever
been
given
by
the
legislature
to
the
subject
of
disinfectants
nancy
saw
that
jessica
was
watching
the
speaker
with
jealous
eyes
and
in
spite
of
prudence
she
could
not
help
behaving
to
barmby
more
graciously
than
usual
a
small
revenge
for
the
treatment
she
had
suffered
at
the
hands
of
miss
morgan
i
could
point
out
a
great
number
of
such
anomalies
pursued
samuel
but
this
matter
of
disinfectants
is
really
one
of
the
gravest
my
father
has
written
to
about
it
and
his
letter
will
probably
be
inserted
i
am
thinking
of
bringing
it
before
the
attention
of
our
do
peachey
s
people
adulterate
their
disinfectants
inquired
nancy
i
was
going
to
tell
you
some
acquaintances
of
ours
have
had
a
severe
illness
in
their
house
and
have
been
using
disinfectants
made
by
ducker
blunt
fortunately
they
have
a
very
good
medical
man
and
through
him
it
has
been
discovered
that
these
pretended
safeguards
are
all
but
absolutely
worthless
he
had
the
stuff
analysed
now
isn
t
this
shameful
isn
t
this
abominable
for
my
own
part
i
should
call
it
constructive
the
phrase
came
by
haphazard
to
samuel
s
tongue
and
he
uttered
it
with
gusto
repeating
it
twice
or
thrice
constructive
murder
nothing
short
of
that
and
to
think
that
these
people
enjoy
a
positive
immunity
he
corrected
himself
quickly
then
uncertain
whether
he
had
really
made
a
mistake
reddened
and
twisted
his
gloves
to
think
he
raised
his
voice
that
they
are
capable
of
making
money
out
of
disease
and
death
it
is
one
of
the
worst
illustrations
of
a
corrupt
spirit
in
the
commercial
life
of
our
times
that
has
yet
come
under
my
he
remained
for
a
couple
of
hours
talking
ceaselessly
a
glance
which
he
now
and
then
cast
at
miss
morgan
betrayed
his
hope
that
she
would
take
her
leave
before
the
necessary
time
of
his
own
departure
jessica
perfectly
aware
of
this
desire
sat
as
though
no
less
at
home
than
nancy
every
remark
she
made
was
a
stroke
of
malice
at
her
friend
and
in
her
drawn
features
appeared
the
passions
by
which
she
was
tormented
as
soon
as
barmby
had
regretfully
withdrawn
nancy
turned
upon
the
girl
with
flashing
eyes
i
want
to
speak
to
you
come
she
led
the
way
to
the
jessica
followed
without
a
word
why
are
you
behaving
like
this
what
has
come
to
you
the
feeble
anaemic
creature
fell
back
before
this
outbreak
of
wholesome
wrath
her
eyes
stared
in
alarm
i
won
t
put
up
with
it
cried
nancy
if
you
think
you
can
insult
me
because
i
trusted
you
when
you
were
my
only
friend
you
ll
find
your
mistake
a
little
more
and
you
shall
see
how
little
your
power
over
me
is
worth
am
i
to
live
at
mercy
i
d
starve
rather
what
do
you
mean
by
it
oh
nancy
to
think
you
should
speak
to
me
like
you
are
to
be
allowed
to
spit
poison
at
me
are
you
and
i
must
bear
it
no
that
i
won
t
of
course
i
know
what
s
the
matter
with
you
you
have
fallen
in
love
with
samuel
you
have
any
one
can
see
it
you
have
no
more
command
of
yourself
than
a
child
and
because
he
prefers
me
to
you
you
rage
against
me
idiot
what
is
samuel
barmby
to
me
can
i
do
more
to
keep
him
off
can
i
say
to
him
do
have
pity
on
poor
miss
morgan
who
she
was
interrupted
by
a
scream
on
which
followed
a
torrent
of
frenzied
words
from
jessica
you
re
a
woman
you
ve
behaved
disgracefully
yourself
oh
i
know
more
than
you
think
and
now
you
accuse
me
of
being
as
bad
why
did
you
get
married
in
such
a
hurry
do
you
think
i
didn
t
understand
it
it
s
you
who
have
no
command
over
yourself
if
the
truth
were
known
no
decent
woman
would
ever
speak
to
you
again
and
you
ve
got
your
reward
pretend
as
you
like
i
know
your
husband
has
deserted
you
what
else
could
you
expect
that
s
what
makes
you
hate
every
one
that
hasn
t
fallen
into
the
mud
i
wouldn
t
have
such
a
character
as
yours
all
this
afternoon
you
ve
been
looking
at
that
man
as
no
married
woman
could
who
respected
herself
you
encourage
him
he
comes
here
often
hysterical
passion
strangled
her
voice
and
before
she
could
recover
breath
nancy
terrible
in
ire
advanced
upon
her
leave
this
house
and
never
dare
to
show
yourself
here
again
do
what
you
like
i
ll
endure
you
no
longer
be
off
jessica
retreated
her
bloodless
lips
apart
her
eyes
starting
as
in
suffocation
she
stumbled
against
a
chair
fell
to
the
ground
and
with
a
cry
of
anguish
threw
herself
upon
her
knees
before
nancy
what
did
i
say
i
didn
t
mean
it
i
don
t
know
what
i
have
been
saying
it
was
all
madness
oh
do
forgive
me
that
isn
t
how
i
really
think
of
you
you
know
it
isn
t
i
m
not
so
wicked
as
that
we
have
been
friends
so
long
i
must
have
gone
mad
to
speak
such
words
don
t
drive
me
away
from
you
dear
dear
nancy
i
implore
you
to
forgive
me
look
i
pray
to
you
on
my
knees
to
forget
it
despise
me
for
being
such
a
weak
wicked
creature
but
don
t
drive
me
away
like
that
i
didn
t
mean
one
word
i
rubbish
of
course
you
meant
it
you
have
thought
it
every
day
and
you
ll
say
it
again
behind
my
back
if
not
to
my
face
stand
up
and
don
t
make
yourself
sillier
than
you
you
can
t
call
me
anything
too
bad
but
don
t
drive
me
away
i
can
t
bear
it
you
are
the
only
friend
i
have
in
the
world
the
only
only
friend
no
one
was
ever
kind
and
good
to
me
but
you
and
this
is
how
i
have
repaid
you
oh
i
hate
myself
i
could
tear
my
tongue
out
for
saying
such
things
only
say
that
you
ll
try
to
forgive
me
dear
nancy
dear
she
fell
with
face
upon
the
carpet
and
grovelled
there
in
anguish
of
conflicting
passions
a
lamentable
object
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
her
nancy
moved
away
and
stood
with
back
turned
perforce
hearing
the
moans
and
sobs
and
words
which
lasted
until
the
fit
of
hysteria
left
its
victim
in
mute
exhaustion
then
contemptuously
pitiful
she
drew
near
again
to
the
prostrate
figure
stand
up
at
once
and
let
us
have
an
end
of
this
vulgar
folly
stand
up
or
i
ll
leave
you
here
and
never
speak
to
you
nancy
can
you
forgive
me
i
believe
you
have
never
got
over
your
illness
if
i
were
you
i
should
see
the
doctor
again
and
try
to
be
cured
you
ll
end
in
an
asylum
if
you
don
t
i
often
feel
almost
mad
i
do
really
will
you
forget
those
dreadful
words
i
spoke
i
know
you
can
t
forgive
me
at
once
only
stand
up
and
try
to
behave
like
a
reasonable
being
what
do
i
care
for
your
words
the
girl
raised
herself
threw
her
arms
over
a
chair
and
wept
miserably
chapter
on
an
afternoon
at
the
end
of
october
samuel
barmby
returned
from
business
found
miss
morgan
having
tea
with
his
sisters
for
a
month
or
two
after
midsummer
the
barmbys
had
scarcely
seen
her
now
their
friendly
intercourse
was
renewed
and
jessica
came
at
least
once
a
week
she
had
an
engagement
at
a
girls
school
in
this
neighbourhood
and
though
her
health
threatened
another
collapse
she
talked
of
resuming
study
for
the
matriculation
of
next
year
samuel
perfectly
aware
of
the
slavish
homage
which
miss
morgan
paid
him
took
pleasure
in
posing
before
her
it
never
entered
his
mind
to
make
any
return
beyond
genial
patronage
but
the
incense
of
a
female
devotee
was
always
grateful
to
him
and
he
had
come
to
look
upon
jessica
as
a
young
person
peculiarly
appreciative
of
intellectual
distinction
a
week
ago
walking
with
her
to
the
omnibus
after
an
evening
she
had
spent
in
dagmar
road
he
had
indulged
a
spirit
of
confidence
and
led
her
to
speak
of
nancy
lord
the
upshot
of
five
minutes
conversation
was
a
frank
inquiry
which
he
could
hardly
have
permitted
himself
but
for
the
shadow
of
night
and
the
isolating
noises
around
them
as
an
intimate
friend
did
she
feel
able
to
tell
him
whether
or
not
miss
lord
was
engaged
to
be
married
jessica
after
a
brief
silence
answered
that
she
did
feel
at
liberty
to
disclose
what
she
knew
on
the
subject
but
the
words
she
used
and
her
voice
in
uttering
them
left
no
doubt
as
to
her
meaning
samuel
said
no
more
at
parting
he
pressed
the
girl
s
hand
warmly
this
afternoon
they
began
by
avoiding
each
other
s
look
samuel
seemed
indisposed
for
conversation
he
sipped
at
a
cup
of
tea
with
an
abstracted
and
somewhat
weary
air
until
miss
morgan
addressed
him
is
the
evening
of
your
lecture
isn
t
it
barmby
by
the
agency
of
a
friend
who
belonged
to
a
society
of
mutual
improvement
at
pentonville
samuel
had
been
invited
to
go
over
and
illumine
with
his
wisdom
the
seekers
after
culture
in
that
remote
district
a
proposal
that
flattered
him
immensely
and
inspired
him
with
a
hope
of
more
than
suburban
fame
for
some
months
he
had
spoken
of
the
engagement
he
was
to
discourse
upon
national
greatness
its
obligations
and
its
of
course
it
will
be
printed
afterwards
pursued
the
devotee
oh
i
don
t
know
it
s
hardly
worth
oh
i
m
sure
it
will
be
and
jessica
appealed
to
the
sisters
who
declared
that
certain
passages
they
had
been
privileged
to
hear
seemed
to
them
very
remarkable
ladies
were
to
be
admitted
but
the
miss
barmbys
felt
afraid
to
undertake
so
long
a
journey
after
dark
i
know
some
one
who
would
very
much
like
to
go
said
jessica
steadying
her
voice
could
you
spare
me
a
ticket
to
give
away
mr
barmby
samuel
smiled
graciously
and
promised
the
ticket
of
course
it
was
for
jessica
s
own
use
on
the
following
evening
long
before
the
hour
which
would
have
allowed
her
ample
time
to
reach
pentonville
by
eight
o
clock
she
set
forth
excitedly
unless
samuel
barmby
were
accompanied
by
some
friend
from
camberwell
only
too
probable
she
might
hope
to
make
the
return
journey
under
his
protection
perhaps
he
would
speak
again
of
nancy
lord
and
this
time
he
should
be
answered
with
less
reserve
what
harm
if
she
even
told
him
the
name
of
the
man
whom
nancy
was
engaged
to
marry
nancy
was
no
longer
her
friend
a
show
of
reconciliation
had
followed
that
scene
on
the
sunday
afternoon
three
months
ago
but
jessica
well
knew
that
she
had
put
herself
beyond
forgiveness
nor
did
she
desire
it
even
without
the
memory
of
her
offence
by
this
time
she
must
needs
have
regarded
nancy
with
steadfast
dislike
weeks
had
gone
by
since
their
last
meeting
which
was
rendered
so
unpleasant
by
mutual
coldness
that
a
renewal
of
intercourse
seemed
out
of
the
question
she
would
not
be
guilty
of
treachery
but
in
justice
to
herself
she
might
give
samuel
barmby
to
understand
how
hopeless
was
his
wooing
to
her
disappointment
the
was
small
and
undignified
she
had
imagined
a
capacious
hall
with
samuel
bennett
barmby
standing
up
before
an
audience
of
several
hundred
people
the
chairs
numbered
not
more
than
fifty
and
at
eight
o
clock
some
of
them
were
still
unoccupied
nor
did
the
assembly
answer
to
her
expectation
it
seemed
to
consist
of
young
shopmen
with
a
few
females
of
their
kind
interspersed
she
chose
a
place
in
the
middle
of
the
room
where
the
lecturer
could
hardly
fail
to
observe
her
presence
with
barmby
s
entrance
disillusion
gave
way
before
the
ardours
of
flesh
and
spirit
the
whole
hour
through
she
never
took
her
eyes
from
him
his
smooth
pink
face
with
its
shining
moustache
embodied
her
ideal
of
manly
beauty
his
tall
figure
inflamed
her
senses
the
words
that
fell
from
his
lips
sounded
to
her
with
oracular
impressiveness
conveying
a
wisdom
before
which
she
bowed
and
a
noble
enthusiasm
to
which
she
responded
in
fervent
exaltation
and
she
had
been
wont
to
ridicule
this
man
to
join
in
mockery
of
his
eloquence
with
a
conceited
wanton
such
as
nancy
lord
no
it
never
came
from
her
heart
it
was
moral
cowardice
from
the
first
she
had
recognised
samuel
barmby
s
infinite
superiority
to
the
ignoble
the
impure
girl
who
dared
to
deride
him
he
saw
her
their
eyes
met
once
and
again
and
yet
again
he
knew
that
she
alone
in
the
audience
could
comprehend
his
noble
morality
grasp
the
extent
of
his
speculations
to
her
he
spoke
and
in
his
deep
glowing
heart
he
could
not
but
thank
her
for
such
evidence
of
sympathy
there
followed
a
tedious
debate
a
muddy
flow
of
gabble
and
balderdash
it
was
over
by
ten
o
clock
with
jealous
eyes
she
watched
her
hero
surrounded
by
people
who
thought
poor
creatures
that
they
were
worthy
of
offering
him
congratulations
at
a
distance
she
lingered
and
behold
his
eye
once
more
fell
upon
her
he
came
out
from
among
the
silly
chatterers
and
walked
towards
her
you
played
me
a
trick
miss
morgan
i
should
never
have
allowed
you
to
come
all
this
way
to
hear
if
i
had
come
ten
times
the
distance
i
should
have
been
repaid
his
round
eyes
gloated
upon
the
flattery
well
well
i
mustn
t
pretend
that
i
think
the
lecture
worthless
but
you
might
have
had
the
manuscript
to
read
are
you
quite
alone
then
i
must
take
care
of
you
it
s
a
wretched
night
we
ll
have
a
cab
to
king
s
he
said
it
with
a
consciousness
of
generosity
jessica
s
heart
leapt
and
throbbed
she
was
by
his
side
in
the
vehicle
her
body
touched
his
she
felt
his
warm
breath
as
he
talked
in
all
too
short
a
time
they
reached
the
railway
station
did
you
come
this
way
have
you
a
ticket
leave
that
to
again
largely
generous
he
strode
to
the
they
descended
and
stood
together
upon
the
platform
among
hurrying
crowds
in
black
fumes
that
poisoned
the
palate
with
sulphur
this
way
and
that
sped
the
demon
engines
whirling
lighted
waggons
full
of
people
shrill
whistles
the
hiss
and
roar
of
steam
the
bang
clap
bang
of
the
clatter
of
feet
on
wood
and
stone
all
echoed
and
reverberated
from
a
huge
cloudy
vault
above
them
high
and
low
on
every
available
yard
of
wall
advertisements
clamoured
to
the
eye
theatres
journals
soaps
medicines
concerts
furniture
wines
all
the
produce
and
refuse
of
civilisation
announced
in
staring
letters
in
daubed
effigies
base
paltry
grotesque
a
of
advertisements
fitly
chosen
amid
subterranean
din
and
reek
a
symbol
to
the
gaze
of
that
relentless
warfare
which
ceases
not
night
and
day
in
the
world
above
for
the
southward
train
they
had
to
wait
ten
minutes
jessica
keeping
as
close
as
possible
to
her
companion
s
side
tried
to
converse
but
her
thoughts
were
in
a
tumult
like
to
that
about
her
she
felt
a
faintness
a
quivering
in
her
limbs
may
i
sit
down
for
a
moment
she
said
looking
at
barmby
with
a
childlike
appeal
to
be
she
pointed
in
a
direction
away
from
the
crowd
i
have
something
to
say
it
s
quieter
samuel
evinced
surprise
but
allowed
himself
to
be
led
towards
the
black
mouth
of
the
tunnel
whence
at
that
moment
rushed
an
engine
with
glaring
lights
upon
its
breast
we
may
not
be
alone
in
the
train
continued
jessica
there
s
something
you
ought
to
know
i
must
tell
you
you
were
asking
me
about
nancy
she
spoke
with
panting
breath
and
looked
fixedly
at
him
the
eagerness
with
which
he
lent
ear
gave
her
strength
to
proceed
you
asked
me
if
she
was
yes
well
he
had
even
forgotten
his
politeness
he
saw
in
her
a
mere
source
of
information
jessica
moved
closer
to
him
on
the
bench
had
you
any
reason
for
thinking
she
was
no
particular
reason
except
something
strange
in
her
would
you
like
to
know
the
whole
truth
it
was
a
very
cold
night
and
a
keen
wind
swept
the
platform
but
jessica
though
indifferently
clad
felt
no
discomfort
from
this
cause
yet
she
pressed
closer
to
her
companion
so
that
her
cheek
all
but
touched
his
shoulder
of
course
i
should
barmby
answered
is
there
any
mystery
i
oughtn
t
to
then
you
had
better
not
but
why
did
you
begin
you
ought
to
why
ought
i
to
know
because
you
she
broke
off
a
sudden
chill
made
her
teeth
chatter
well
why
asked
samuel
with
impatience
are
you
are
you
in
love
with
her
voice
and
look
embarrassed
him
so
did
the
girl
s
proximity
she
was
now
all
but
leaning
on
his
shoulder
respectable
barmby
could
not
be
aware
that
jessica
s
state
of
mind
rendered
her
scarcely
responsible
for
what
she
said
or
did
that
s
a
very
plain
question
he
began
but
she
interrupted
him
i
oughtn
t
to
ask
it
there
s
no
need
for
you
to
answer
i
know
you
have
wanted
to
marry
her
for
a
long
time
but
you
never
perhaps
not
if
she
has
promised
somebody
if
i
tell
you
will
you
be
kind
to
me
kind
i
didn
t
mean
that
she
added
hurriedly
i
mean
will
you
understand
that
i
felt
it
a
duty
i
oughtn
t
to
tell
a
secret
but
it
s
a
secret
that
oughtn
t
to
be
kept
will
you
understand
that
i
did
it
out
of
out
of
friendship
for
you
and
because
i
thought
it
right
oh
certainly
after
going
so
far
you
had
better
tell
me
and
have
done
with
jessica
approached
her
lips
to
his
ear
and
whispered
she
is
what
impossible
she
was
married
at
teignmouth
just
before
she
came
back
from
her
holiday
last
well
upon
my
word
and
that
s
why
she
has
been
away
in
cornwall
again
jessica
whispered
her
body
quivering
the
while
she
has
a
child
it
was
born
last
well
upon
my
word
now
i
understand
who
could
have
imagined
you
see
what
she
is
she
hides
it
for
the
sake
of
the
but
who
is
her
husband
asked
samuel
staring
at
the
bloodless
face
a
man
called
tarrant
a
relative
of
vawdrey
of
champion
hill
she
thought
he
was
rich
i
don
t
know
whether
he
is
or
not
but
i
believe
he
doesn
t
mean
to
come
back
to
her
he
s
in
america
barmby
questioned
and
jessica
answered
until
there
was
nothing
left
to
ask
or
to
tell
save
the
one
thing
which
rose
suddenly
to
jessica
s
lips
you
won
t
let
her
know
that
i
have
told
you
samuel
gravely
but
coldly
assured
her
that
she
need
not
fear
betrayal
chapter
it
was
to
be
in
three
volumes
she
saw
her
way
pretty
clearly
to
the
end
of
the
first
she
had
ideas
for
the
second
the
third
must
take
care
of
itself
until
she
reached
it
hero
and
heroine
ready
to
her
hand
subordinate
characters
vaguely
floating
in
the
background
after
an
hour
or
two
of
meditation
she
sat
down
and
dashed
at
chapter
one
long
before
the
end
of
the
year
it
ought
to
be
finished
but
in
august
came
her
baby
s
first
illness
for
nearly
a
fortnight
she
was
away
from
home
and
on
her
return
though
no
anxiety
remained
she
found
it
difficult
to
resume
work
the
few
chapters
completed
had
a
sorry
look
they
did
not
read
well
not
at
all
like
writing
destined
to
be
read
in
print
after
a
week
s
disheartenment
she
made
a
new
beginning
at
the
end
of
september
baby
again
alarmed
her
a
trivial
ailment
as
before
but
she
could
not
leave
the
child
until
all
was
well
again
she
reviewed
her
work
and
with
more
repugnance
than
after
the
previous
interruption
but
go
on
with
it
she
must
and
would
the
distasteful
labour
slow
wearisome
often
performed
without
pretence
of
hope
went
on
until
october
then
she
broke
down
mary
woodruff
found
her
crying
by
the
fireside
feverish
and
unnerved
i
can
t
sleep
she
said
i
hear
the
clock
strike
every
hour
night
after
but
she
would
not
confess
the
cause
in
writing
her
poor
novel
she
had
lived
again
through
the
story
enacted
at
teignmouth
and
her
heart
failed
beneath
its
burden
of
hopeless
longing
her
husband
had
forsaken
her
even
if
she
saw
him
again
what
solace
could
be
found
in
the
mere
proximity
of
a
man
who
did
not
love
her
who
had
never
loved
her
the
child
was
not
enough
its
fatherless
estate
enhanced
the
misery
of
her
own
solitude
when
the
leaves
fell
and
the
sky
darkened
and
the
long
london
winter
gloomed
before
her
she
sank
with
a
moan
of
despair
mary
s
strength
and
tenderness
were
now
invaluable
by
sheer
force
of
will
she
overcame
the
malady
in
its
physical
effects
and
did
wonders
in
the
assailing
of
its
moral
source
her
appeal
now
as
formerly
was
to
the
nobler
pride
always
struggling
for
control
in
nancy
s
character
a
few
days
of
combat
with
the
besieging
melancholy
that
threatened
disaster
and
nancy
could
meet
her
friend
s
look
with
a
smile
she
put
away
and
turned
the
key
upon
her
futile
scribbling
no
more
of
that
was
not
her
vocation
she
must
seek
again
early
in
the
afternoon
she
made
ready
to
go
forth
on
the
only
business
which
now
took
her
from
home
it
was
nearly
a
week
since
she
had
seen
her
boy
opening
the
front
door
she
came
unexpectedly
under
two
pairs
of
eyes
face
to
face
with
her
stood
samuel
barmby
his
hand
raised
to
signal
at
the
knocker
just
withdrawn
from
him
and
behind
barmby
was
a
postman
holding
a
letter
which
in
another
moment
would
have
dropped
into
the
box
samuel
performed
the
civil
salute
ha
how
do
you
do
miss
lord
you
are
going
out
i
m
yes
i
am
going
she
replied
mechanically
and
in
speaking
took
the
letter
held
out
to
her
a
glance
at
it
sent
all
her
blood
rushing
upon
the
heart
i
want
to
see
you
particularly
said
samuel
could
i
call
again
this
afternoon
nancy
gazed
at
him
but
did
not
hear
he
saw
the
sudden
pallor
of
her
cheeks
and
thought
he
understood
it
as
she
stood
like
a
statue
he
spoke
again
it
is
very
particular
business
if
you
could
give
me
an
appointment
business
oh
come
in
if
you
she
drew
back
to
admit
him
but
in
the
passage
stood
looking
at
her
letter
barmby
was
perplexed
and
embarrassed
you
had
rather
i
called
again
called
again
just
as
you
oh
then
i
will
stay
said
samuel
bluntly
for
he
had
things
in
mind
which
disposed
him
to
resent
this
flagrant
discourtesy
his
voice
awakened
nancy
she
opened
the
door
of
the
will
you
sit
down
barmby
and
excuse
me
for
a
few
minutes
certainly
don
t
let
me
inconvenience
you
miss
at
another
time
nancy
would
have
remarked
something
very
unusual
in
his
way
of
speaking
especially
in
the
utterance
of
her
name
but
for
the
letter
in
her
hand
she
must
have
noticed
with
uneasiness
a
certain
severity
of
countenance
which
had
taken
the
place
of
barmby
s
wonted
smile
as
it
was
she
scarcely
realised
his
presence
and
on
closing
the
door
of
the
room
he
had
entered
she
forthwith
forgot
that
such
a
man
existed
her
letter
his
handwriting
at
last
and
he
was
in
england
she
flew
up
to
her
bedroom
and
tore
open
the
envelope
he
was
in
london
great
college
street
a
short
letter
soon
read
dearest
nancy
i
am
ashamed
to
write
yet
write
i
must
all
your
letters
reached
me
there
was
no
reason
for
my
silence
but
the
unwillingness
to
keep
sending
bad
news
i
have
still
nothing
good
to
tell
you
but
here
i
am
in
london
again
and
you
must
know
of
it
when
i
posted
my
last
letter
to
you
from
new
york
i
meant
to
come
back
as
soon
as
i
could
get
money
enough
to
pay
my
passage
since
then
i
have
gone
through
a
miserable
time
idle
for
the
most
part
ill
for
a
few
weeks
and
occasionally
trying
to
write
something
that
editors
would
pay
for
but
after
all
i
had
to
borrow
it
has
brought
me
home
steerage
if
you
know
what
that
means
and
now
i
must
earn
more
if
we
were
to
meet
i
might
be
able
to
say
something
else
i
can
t
write
it
let
me
hear
from
you
if
you
think
me
worth
a
yours
ever
dear
girl
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
stood
with
this
sheet
open
as
though
still
reading
her
face
was
void
of
emotion
she
had
a
vacant
look
cheerless
but
with
no
more
decided
significance
then
she
remembered
that
samuel
barmby
was
waiting
for
her
downstairs
he
might
have
something
to
say
which
really
concerned
her
better
see
him
at
once
and
get
rid
of
him
with
slow
step
she
descended
to
the
the
letter
folded
and
rolled
she
carried
in
her
hand
i
m
sorry
to
have
kept
you
waiting
don
t
mention
it
will
you
sit
down
yes
of
she
spoke
abstractedly
and
took
a
seat
not
far
from
him
i
was
just
going
out
but
there
s
no
i
hardly
know
how
to
begin
perhaps
i
had
better
prepare
you
by
saying
that
i
have
received
very
strange
his
air
was
magisterial
he
subdued
his
voice
to
a
note
of
profound
solemnity
what
sort
of
information
asked
nancy
vaguely
her
brows
knitted
in
a
look
rather
of
annoyance
than
apprehension
very
strange
you
have
said
that
her
temper
was
failing
she
felt
a
nervous
impulse
to
behave
rudely
to
declare
the
contempt
it
was
always
difficult
to
disguise
when
talking
with
barmby
i
repeat
it
because
you
seem
to
have
no
idea
what
i
am
going
to
speak
of
i
am
the
last
person
to
find
pleasure
in
such
a
disagreeable
duty
as
is
now
laid
upon
me
in
that
respect
i
believe
you
will
do
me
will
you
speak
plainly
this
roundabout
talk
is
samuel
drew
himself
up
and
regarded
her
with
offended
dignity
he
had
promised
himself
no
small
satisfaction
from
this
interview
had
foreseen
its
salient
points
his
mere
aspect
would
be
enough
to
subdue
nancy
and
when
he
began
to
speak
she
would
tremble
before
him
such
a
moment
would
repay
him
for
the
enforced
humility
of
years
perhaps
she
would
weep
she
might
even
implore
him
to
be
merciful
how
to
act
in
that
event
he
had
quite
made
up
his
mind
but
all
such
anticipations
were
confused
by
nancy
s
singular
behaviour
she
seemed
in
truth
not
to
understand
the
hints
which
should
have
overwhelmed
her
more
magisterial
than
ever
he
began
to
speak
with
slow
emphasis
miss
lord
i
will
still
address
you
by
that
name
though
for
a
very
long
time
i
have
regarded
you
as
a
person
worthy
of
all
admiration
and
have
sincerely
humbled
myself
before
you
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
a
certain
respect
is
due
to
me
even
though
i
find
that
you
have
deceived
me
as
to
your
position
the
old
feelings
are
still
so
strong
in
me
that
i
could
not
bear
to
give
you
needless
pain
instead
of
announcing
to
my
father
and
to
other
people
the
strange
facts
which
i
have
learnt
i
come
here
as
a
friend
i
speak
with
all
possible
forbearance
i
do
my
utmost
to
spare
you
am
i
not
justified
in
expecting
at
least
courteous
treatment
a
pause
of
awful
impressiveness
the
listener
fully
conscious
at
length
of
the
situation
she
had
to
face
fell
into
a
calmer
mood
all
was
over
suspense
and
the
burden
of
falsehood
had
no
longer
to
be
endured
her
part
now
for
this
hour
at
all
events
was
merely
to
stand
by
whilst
fate
unfolded
itself
please
say
whatever
you
have
to
say
barmby
she
replied
with
quiet
civility
i
believe
your
intention
was
good
you
made
me
nervous
that
was
pray
forgive
me
perhaps
it
will
be
best
if
i
ask
you
a
simple
question
you
will
see
that
the
position
i
hold
under
your
father
s
will
leaves
me
no
choice
but
to
ask
it
is
it
true
that
you
are
married
i
will
answer
if
you
tell
me
how
you
came
to
think
that
i
was
i
have
been
credibly
by
whom
you
must
forgive
me
i
can
t
tell
you
the
then
i
can
t
answer
your
samuel
mused
he
was
unwilling
to
break
a
distinct
promise
no
doubt
said
nancy
you
have
undertaken
not
to
mention
the
i
if
it
is
some
one
who
used
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
you
needn
t
have
any
scruples
she
as
good
as
told
me
what
she
meant
to
do
of
course
it
is
miss
morgan
as
you
have
yourself
spoken
the
name
very
well
she
isn
t
in
her
senses
and
i
wonder
she
has
kept
the
secret
so
you
admit
the
truth
of
what
she
has
told
me
yes
i
am
she
made
the
avowal
in
a
tone
very
like
that
in
which
to
beatrice
french
she
had
affirmed
the
contrary
and
your
true
name
is
tarrant
that
is
my
the
crudely
masculine
in
barmby
prompted
one
more
question
but
some
other
motive
checked
him
he
let
his
eyes
wander
slowly
about
the
room
even
yet
there
was
a
chance
of
playing
off
certain
effects
which
he
had
rehearsed
with
gusto
can
you
imagine
his
voice
shook
a
little
how
much
i
suffer
in
hearing
you
say
this
if
you
mean
that
you
still
had
the
hopes
expressed
in
your
letter
some
time
ago
i
can
only
say
in
my
defence
that
i
gave
you
an
honest
yes
you
said
you
could
never
marry
me
but
of
course
i
couldn
t
understand
it
in
this
sense
it
is
a
blow
i
find
it
very
hard
to
he
rose
and
went
to
the
window
as
if
ashamed
of
the
emotion
he
could
not
command
nancy
too
much
occupied
with
her
own
troubles
to
ask
or
care
whether
his
distress
was
genuine
laid
tarrant
s
letter
upon
a
and
began
to
draw
off
her
gloves
then
she
unbuttoned
her
jacket
these
garments
oppressed
her
samuel
turned
his
head
and
came
slowly
back
there
are
things
that
might
be
said
but
i
will
not
say
them
most
men
in
my
position
would
yield
to
the
temptation
of
revenge
but
for
many
years
i
have
kept
in
view
a
moral
ideal
and
now
i
have
the
satisfaction
of
conquering
my
lower
self
you
shall
not
hear
one
word
of
reproach
from
my
he
waited
for
the
reply
the
expected
murmur
of
gratitude
nancy
said
nothing
mrs
tarrant
he
stood
before
her
what
do
you
suppose
must
be
the
result
of
this
there
can
only
be
you
mean
the
ruin
of
your
prospects
but
do
you
forget
that
all
the
money
you
have
received
since
lord
s
death
has
been
obtained
by
false
pretences
are
you
not
aware
that
this
is
a
criminal
offence
nancy
raised
her
eyes
and
looked
steadily
at
him
then
i
must
bear
the
for
a
minute
barmby
enjoyed
her
suffering
of
his
foreseen
effects
this
one
had
come
nearest
to
succeeding
but
he
was
not
satisfied
he
hoped
she
would
beseech
his
clemency
the
punishment
might
be
very
serious
i
really
can
t
say
what
view
my
father
may
take
of
this
is
there
any
use
in
talking
about
it
i
am
penniless
that
s
all
you
have
to
tell
me
what
else
i
have
to
bear
i
shall
know
soon
one
thing
i
must
ask
isn
t
your
husband
in
a
position
to
support
you
i
can
t
answer
that
please
to
say
nothing
about
my
barmby
caught
at
hope
it
might
be
true
as
jessica
morgan
believed
that
nancy
was
forsaken
the
man
tarrant
might
be
wealthy
enough
to
disregard
her
prospects
in
that
case
an
assiduous
lover
one
who
by
the
exercise
of
a
prudent
generosity
had
obtained
power
over
the
girl
could
yet
hope
for
reward
samuel
had
as
little
of
the
villain
in
his
composition
as
any
camberwell
householder
he
cherished
no
dark
designs
but
after
the
manner
of
his
kind
he
was
in
love
with
nancy
and
even
the
long
pursuit
of
a
lofty
ideal
does
not
render
a
man
proof
against
the
elementary
forces
of
human
nature
we
will
suppose
then
he
said
with
a
certain
cheerfulness
that
you
have
nothing
whatever
to
depend
upon
but
your
father
s
will
what
is
before
you
how
can
you
live
that
is
my
own
it
was
not
said
offensively
but
in
a
tone
of
bitter
resignation
barmby
sat
down
opposite
to
her
and
leaned
forward
do
you
think
for
one
moment
his
voice
was
softly
melodious
that
i
i
who
have
loved
you
for
years
could
let
you
suffer
for
want
of
money
he
had
not
skill
to
read
her
countenance
trouble
he
discerned
and
shame
but
the
eyes
the
quivering
nostril
the
hard
cold
lips
spoke
a
language
beyond
samuel
s
interpretation
even
had
he
known
of
the
outrages
previously
inflicted
upon
her
pride
and
that
this
new
attack
came
at
a
moment
when
her
courage
was
baffled
her
heart
cruelly
wounded
he
would
just
as
little
have
comprehended
the
spirit
which
now
kept
her
mute
he
imagined
her
overcome
by
his
generosity
another
of
his
great
effects
had
come
off
with
tolerable
success
put
your
mind
at
rest
he
pursued
mellifluously
you
shall
suffer
no
hardships
i
answer
for
still
mute
and
her
head
bowed
low
such
is
the
power
of
nobility
displayed
before
an
erring
soul
you
have
never
done
me
justice
confess
that
you
haven
t
to
this
remarkable
appeal
nancy
perforce
replied
i
never
thought
ill
of
when
she
had
spoken
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
observing
it
samuel
was
strangely
moved
had
he
impressed
her
even
more
profoundly
than
he
hoped
to
do
jessica
morgan
s
undisguised
subjugation
had
flattered
him
into
credulity
respecting
his
influence
over
the
female
mind
but
you
didn
t
think
me
capable
of
of
anything
extraordinary
even
in
her
torment
nancy
marvelled
at
this
revelation
of
fatuity
she
did
not
understand
the
pranks
of
such
a
mind
as
barmby
s
when
its
balance
is
disturbed
by
exciting
circumstance
what
are
you
offering
me
she
asked
in
a
low
voice
how
could
i
take
money
from
you
i
didn
t
mean
that
you
should
your
secret
has
been
betrayed
to
me
suppose
i
refuse
to
know
anything
about
it
and
leave
things
as
they
were
nancy
kept
her
eyes
down
suppose
i
say
duty
bids
me
injure
this
woman
who
has
injured
but
no
i
will
not
suppose
i
say
i
can
make
her
regret
bitterly
that
she
married
that
other
man
but
no
i
will
not
suppose
instead
of
making
your
secret
known
i
do
my
utmost
to
guard
it
what
would
be
your
opinion
of
this
behaviour
i
should
think
it
was
kindly
meant
but
useless
why
because
it
isn
t
in
your
power
to
guard
the
secret
jessica
morgan
won
t
leave
her
work
half
if
that
s
all
i
say
again
that
you
can
put
your
mind
at
rest
i
answer
for
miss
morgan
with
her
my
will
is
samuel
smiled
a
smile
ineffable
the
smile
of
a
suburban
deity
why
should
you
take
any
trouble
about
me
said
nancy
i
can
do
nothing
for
you
in
you
she
looked
anxiously
at
him
for
his
voice
sounded
ominous
what
you
can
acknowledge
that
you
never
did
me
it
s
true
that
i
didn
t
she
answered
languidly
speaking
as
though
the
concession
mattered
little
barmby
brightened
his
hands
were
upon
his
knees
he
raised
his
chin
and
smiled
at
vacancy
you
thought
me
unworthy
of
you
you
can
confess
to
me
that
you
were
i
didn
t
know
you
as
i
do
now
fell
from
the
expressionless
lips
thank
you
for
saying
that
well
then
your
anxiety
is
at
an
end
you
are
not
in
the
hands
of
a
mercenary
enemy
but
of
a
man
whose
principles
forbid
him
to
do
anything
ignoble
who
has
an
ideal
of
life
the
result
of
much
study
and
thought
you
have
never
heard
me
speak
about
religion
but
you
would
be
gravely
mistaken
if
you
thought
i
had
no
religious
convictions
some
day
i
shall
treat
that
subject
before
our
society
and
it
is
probable
that
my
views
will
give
rise
to
a
good
deal
of
discussion
i
have
formed
a
religion
for
myself
when
i
write
my
essay
i
think
i
shall
call
it
the
religion
of
a
man
of
one
of
the
great
evils
of
the
day
is
the
vulgar
supposition
that
commerce
has
nothing
to
do
with
religious
faith
i
shall
show
how
utterly
wrong
that
is
it
would
take
too
long
to
explain
to
you
my
mature
views
of
christianity
i
am
not
sure
that
i
recognise
any
of
the
ordinary
dogmas
i
think
i
have
progressed
beyond
them
however
we
shall
have
many
opportunities
of
talking
about
these
nancy
uttered
a
mere
she
was
looking
at
tarrant
s
letter
on
the
and
wishing
to
be
alone
that
she
might
read
it
again
in
the
meantime
samuel
pursued
whatever
difficulty
arises
confide
it
to
me
probably
you
will
wish
to
tell
me
more
before
long
you
know
that
i
am
not
unworthy
to
be
your
adviser
and
so
let
us
shake
hands
in
sign
of
genuine
nancy
gave
her
fingers
which
felt
very
cold
upon
barmby
s
warm
moist
palm
this
conversation
has
been
trying
to
you
he
said
but
relief
of
mind
will
soon
follow
if
anything
occurs
to
me
that
may
help
to
soothe
you
i
will
thank
at
the
beginning
of
our
interview
you
didn
t
think
it
would
end
like
this
there
was
something
of
the
boy
in
samuel
perhaps
the
wholesomest
part
of
him
having
manifested
his
admirable
qualities
he
felt
a
pleasure
in
asking
for
renewed
assurance
of
the
good
opinion
he
had
earned
i
hardly
cared
said
nancy
as
she
rose
with
a
sigh
of
weariness
but
you
have
got
over
that
you
will
be
quite
cheerful
now
in
time
no
i
shall
call
again
let
us
say
on
wednesday
evening
by
that
time
i
shall
be
able
to
put
you
entirely
at
ease
with
regard
to
miss
nancy
made
no
reply
in
shaking
hands
she
regarded
the
radiant
samuel
with
a
dreamy
interest
and
when
he
had
left
her
she
still
gazed
for
a
few
moments
at
the
door
chapter
the
habit
of
confidence
prompted
nancy
to
seek
mary
woodruff
and
show
her
the
letter
but
for
barmby
s
visit
she
would
have
done
so
as
it
was
her
mind
sullenly
resisted
the
natural
impulse
forlorn
misery
intensified
by
successive
humiliations
whereof
the
latest
was
the
bitterest
hardened
her
even
against
the
one
the
indubitable
friend
to
whom
she
had
never
looked
in
vain
for
help
and
solace
of
course
it
was
not
necessary
to
let
mary
know
with
what
coldness
tarrant
had
communicated
the
fact
of
his
return
but
she
preferred
to
keep
silence
altogether
having
sunk
so
low
as
to
accept
with
semblance
of
gratitude
pompous
favours
dishonouring
connivance
at
the
hands
of
samuel
barmby
she
would
now
stand
alone
in
her
uttermost
degradation
happen
what
might
she
would
act
and
suffer
in
solitude
something
she
had
in
mind
to
do
which
mary
if
told
of
it
would
regard
with
disapproval
mary
was
not
a
deserted
and
insulted
wife
she
could
reason
and
counsel
with
the
calmness
of
one
who
sympathised
but
had
nothing
worse
to
endure
even
mary
s
sympathy
was
necessarily
imperfect
since
she
knew
not
and
should
never
know
what
had
passed
in
the
crucial
interviews
with
beatrice
french
with
jessica
morgan
and
with
samuel
barmby
bent
on
indulging
her
passionate
sense
of
injury
hungering
for
a
taste
of
revenge
however
poor
nancy
executed
with
brief
delay
a
project
which
had
come
into
her
head
during
the
hour
of
torture
just
elapsed
she
took
a
sheet
of
notepaper
and
upon
it
wrote
lines
thus
as
your
reward
for
marrying
me
is
still
a
long
way
off
and
as
you
tell
me
that
you
are
in
want
i
send
you
as
much
as
i
can
spare
at
present
next
month
you
shall
hear
from
me
within
the
paper
she
folded
a
note
and
placed
both
in
an
envelope
which
she
addressed
to
lionel
tarrant
at
his
lodgings
in
westminster
having
posted
this
at
the
first
she
walked
on
her
only
object
was
to
combat
mental
anguish
by
bodily
exercise
to
distract
if
possible
the
thoughts
which
hammered
upon
her
brain
by
moving
amid
the
life
of
the
streets
in
camberwell
road
she
passed
the
place
of
business
inscribed
with
the
names
lord
and
barmby
it
made
her
think
not
of
the
man
who
from
being
an
object
of
her
contempt
was
now
become
a
hated
enemy
but
of
her
father
and
she
mourned
for
him
with
profounder
feeling
than
when
her
tears
flowed
over
his
grave
but
for
headstrong
folly
incredible
in
the
retrospect
that
father
would
have
been
her
dear
and
honoured
companion
her
friend
in
every
best
sense
of
the
word
her
guide
and
protector
many
and
many
a
time
had
he
invited
her
affection
her
trust
for
long
years
it
was
in
her
power
to
make
him
happy
and
in
doing
so
to
enrich
her
own
life
to
discipline
her
mind
as
no
study
of
books
even
had
it
been
genuine
ever
could
oh
to
have
the
time
back
again
the
despised
privilege
the
thwarted
embittered
love
she
was
beginning
to
understand
her
father
to
surmise
with
mature
intelligence
the
causes
of
his
seeming
harshness
to
her
own
boy
when
he
was
old
enough
she
would
talk
of
him
and
praise
him
perhaps
even
thus
late
his
spirit
of
stern
truthfulness
might
bear
fruit
in
her
life
and
in
her
son
s
the
tender
memory
and
pure
resolve
did
not
long
possess
her
they
soon
yielded
before
the
potency
of
present
evil
and
for
an
hour
or
more
she
walked
along
the
sordid
highway
nursing
passions
which
struck
their
venom
into
her
heart
it
was
one
of
those
cold
dry
clouded
evenings
of
autumn
when
london
streets
affect
the
imagination
with
a
peculiar
suggestiveness
lamps
sickly
yellow
under
the
dying
day
stretch
in
immense
vistas
unobscured
by
fog
but
exhibit
no
detail
of
the
track
they
will
presently
illumine
one
by
one
the
grow
radiant
on
deepening
gloom
and
show
in
silhouette
the
figures
numberless
that
are
hurrying
past
by
accentuating
a
pause
between
the
life
of
daytime
and
that
which
will
begin
after
dark
this
grey
hour
excites
to
an
unwonted
perception
of
the
city
s
vastness
and
of
its
multifarious
labour
melancholy
yet
not
dismal
the
brooding
twilight
seems
to
betoken
nature
s
compassion
for
myriad
mortals
exiled
from
her
beauty
and
her
solace
noises
far
and
near
blend
into
a
muffled
murmur
sound
s
equivalent
of
the
impression
received
by
the
eye
it
seems
to
utter
the
weariness
of
unending
ineffectual
toil
nancy
had
now
walked
as
far
as
newington
a
district
unfamiliar
to
her
and
repulsive
by
the
elephant
and
castle
she
stood
watching
the
tumultuous
traffic
which
whirls
and
roars
at
this
confluence
of
six
highways
she
had
neither
a
mind
to
go
on
nor
yet
to
return
the
conductor
of
an
omnibus
close
at
hand
kept
bellowing
london
bridge
and
her
thoughts
wandered
to
that
day
of
meeting
with
luckworth
crewe
when
he
took
her
up
the
monument
she
had
never
felt
more
than
an
idle
interest
in
crewe
and
whenever
she
remembered
him
nowadays
it
was
only
to
reflect
with
bitterness
that
he
doubtless
knew
a
part
of
her
secret
the
part
that
was
known
to
beatrice
french
and
on
that
account
had
ceased
to
urge
his
suit
yet
at
this
moment
she
wished
that
she
had
pledged
herself
to
him
in
good
faith
his
behaviour
argued
the
steadfast
devotion
of
an
honest
man
however
lacking
in
refinement
their
long
engagement
would
have
been
brightened
with
many
hopes
in
the
end
she
might
have
learned
to
love
him
and
prosperity
would
have
opened
to
her
a
world
of
satisfactions
for
which
she
could
no
longer
hope
it
grew
cold
she
allowed
the
movements
of
a
group
of
people
to
direct
her
steps
and
went
eastward
along
new
kent
road
but
when
the
shops
were
past
and
only
a
dreary
prospect
of
featureless
dwellings
lay
before
her
she
felt
her
heart
sink
and
paused
in
vacillating
wretchedness
from
a
house
near
by
sounded
a
piano
a
foolish
jingle
but
it
smote
her
with
a
longing
for
companionship
for
friendly
cheerful
talk
and
then
of
a
sudden
she
determined
that
this
life
of
intolerable
isolation
should
come
to
an
end
her
efforts
to
find
employment
that
would
bring
her
among
people
had
failed
simply
because
she
applied
to
strangers
who
knew
nothing
of
her
capabilities
and
cared
nothing
for
her
needs
but
a
way
offered
itself
if
she
could
overcome
the
poor
lingering
vestiges
of
pride
and
shame
which
hitherto
had
seemed
to
render
it
impossible
in
this
hour
her
desolate
spirit
rejected
everything
but
the
thought
of
relief
to
be
found
in
new
occupation
fresh
society
she
had
endured
to
the
limit
of
strength
under
the
falling
night
before
the
grey
vision
of
a
city
which
by
its
alien
business
and
pleasure
made
her
a
mere
outcast
she
all
at
once
found
hope
in
a
resource
which
till
now
had
signified
despair
summoning
the
first
empty
cab
she
gave
an
address
known
to
her
only
by
hearsay
that
of
the
south
london
fashionable
dress
supply
association
and
was
driven
thither
in
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
shop
with
its
windows
cunningly
laid
out
to
allure
the
female
eye
spread
a
brilliant
frontage
between
two
much
duller
places
of
business
at
the
doorway
stood
a
commissionaire
distributing
some
newly
printed
advertisements
to
the
persons
who
entered
or
who
paused
in
passing
nancy
accepted
a
paper
without
thinking
about
it
and
went
through
the
swing
doors
held
open
for
her
by
a
stripling
in
buttons
she
approached
a
young
woman
at
the
nearest
counter
and
in
a
low
voice
asked
whether
miss
french
was
on
the
premises
i
m
not
sure
madam
i
will
inquire
at
she
calls
me
madam
said
nancy
to
herself
whilst
waiting
so
do
shopkeepers
generally
i
suppose
i
look
the
young
person
she
honeyed
a
cockney
twang
speedily
came
back
to
report
that
miss
french
had
left
about
ago
and
was
not
likely
to
return
can
you
give
me
her
private
address
not
having
seen
miss
french
since
the
latter
s
unwelcome
call
in
grove
lane
she
only
knew
that
beatrice
had
left
de
crespigny
park
to
inhabit
a
flat
somewhere
or
other
i
wish
to
see
her
particularly
on
excuse
me
a
moment
on
returning
the
young
person
requested
nancy
to
follow
her
up
the
shop
and
led
into
a
office
where
at
a
table
covered
with
sat
a
man
with
a
bald
head
of
peculiar
lustre
he
rose
and
bowed
nancy
repeated
her
request
could
i
despatch
a
message
for
you
madam
my
business
is
the
man
coughed
urbanely
and
begged
to
know
her
name
miss
lord
of
grove
immediately
his
countenance
changed
from
deprecating
solemnity
to
a
broad
smile
of
recognition
miss
lord
oh
to
be
sure
i
will
give
you
the
address
at
once
pray
pardon
my
questions
we
have
to
be
so
very
careful
so
many
people
desire
private
interviews
with
miss
french
i
will
jot
down
the
he
did
so
on
the
back
of
an
advertisement
and
added
verbal
directions
nancy
hurried
away
another
cab
conveyed
her
to
brixton
and
set
her
down
before
a
block
of
recently
built
flats
she
ascended
to
the
second
floor
pressed
the
button
of
a
bell
and
was
speedily
confronted
by
a
girl
of
the
natty
species
this
time
she
began
by
giving
her
name
and
had
only
a
moment
to
wait
before
she
was
admitted
to
a
small
furnished
with
semblance
of
luxury
a
glowing
fire
and
the
light
of
an
lamp
showed
as
much
fashionable
upholstery
and
as
could
be
squeezed
into
the
narrow
space
something
else
was
perceptible
which
might
perhaps
have
been
dispensed
with
to
wit
the
odour
of
a
very
savoury
meal
a
meal
in
which
fried
onions
had
no
insignificant
part
but
before
the
visitor
could
comment
to
herself
upon
this
disadvantage
attaching
to
flats
beatrice
joined
her
i
could
hardly
believe
it
so
you
have
really
looked
me
up
awfully
jolly
of
you
i
m
quite
alone
we
ll
have
a
bit
of
dinner
miss
french
was
in
her
most
expansive
mood
she
understood
the
call
as
one
of
simple
friendliness
i
wasn
t
sure
that
you
knew
the
address
got
it
at
the
shop
they
don
t
go
telling
everybody
i
hope
some
one
there
seemed
to
know
my
name
said
nancy
whom
the
warmth
and
light
and
cheery
welcome
encouraged
in
the
step
she
had
taken
and
she
explained
ah
clatworthy
rum
old
cove
when
you
get
to
know
him
yes
yes
no
doubt
he
has
heard
me
speak
of
you
in
a
general
way
you
know
come
into
my
and
take
your
things
the
commonly
called
a
bedroom
lacked
one
detail
of
comfort
pure
air
the
odour
of
dinner
blending
with
toilet
perfumes
made
an
atmosphere
decidedly
oppressive
beatrice
remarked
on
the
smallness
of
the
chamber
adding
archly
but
i
sleep
what
s
your
brother
doing
she
asked
while
helping
to
remove
nancy
s
jacket
i
passed
him
in
oxford
street
the
other
day
and
he
either
didn
t
see
me
or
didn
t
want
to
thought
he
looked
rather
i
know
very
little
about
him
answered
the
visitor
who
spoke
and
acted
without
reflection
conscious
chiefly
at
this
moment
of
faintness
induced
by
fatigue
and
hunger
fanny
s
in
paris
pursued
miss
french
writes
as
if
she
was
amusing
herself
i
think
i
shall
run
over
and
have
a
look
at
her
seen
ada
she
s
been
playing
the
fool
as
usual
found
out
that
arthur
had
taken
the
kid
to
his
sister
s
at
canterbury
went
down
and
made
a
deuce
of
a
they
had
to
chuck
her
out
of
the
house
of
course
she
cares
no
more
about
the
child
than
i
do
it
s
only
to
spite
her
husband
she
s
going
to
law
with
him
she
says
she
won
t
leave
the
house
in
de
crespigny
park
and
she
s
running
up
bills
you
bet
nancy
tried
to
laugh
the
effort
and
its
indicated
surrender
to
her
companion
s
spirit
rather
than
any
attention
to
the
subject
spoken
of
they
returned
to
the
but
had
not
time
to
begin
a
conversation
before
the
servant
summoned
them
to
dinner
a
very
satisfying
meal
it
proved
not
badly
cooked
as
cooking
is
understood
in
brixton
and
served
with
more
of
ceremony
than
the
guest
had
expected
fried
scallops
rump
steak
smothered
in
onions
an
apple
tart
and
very
sound
stilton
cheese
such
fare
testified
to
the
virile
qualities
of
beatrice
s
mind
she
was
above
the
feminine
folly
of
neglecting
honest
victuals
moreover
there
appeared
two
wines
sherry
and
claret
did
you
ever
try
this
kind
of
thing
said
the
hostess
finally
reaching
a
box
of
cigarettes
i
of
course
not
nancy
replied
with
a
laugh
it
s
expected
of
a
sensible
woman
i
ve
got
to
like
it
better
try
no
need
to
make
yourself
uncomfortable
just
keep
the
smoke
in
your
mouth
for
and
blow
it
out
prettily
i
buy
these
in
the
haymarket
special
brand
for
and
you
dine
like
this
by
yourself
every
day
like
this
but
not
always
alone
some
one
or
other
drops
in
luckworth
crewe
was
here
speaking
she
watched
nancy
who
bore
the
regard
with
carelessness
and
replied
lightly
it
s
an
independent
sort
of
life
at
all
just
the
kind
of
life
that
suits
me
i
m
my
own
there
was
a
suggested
allusion
in
the
sly
tone
of
the
last
phrase
but
nancy
thinking
her
own
thoughts
did
not
perceive
it
as
the
servant
had
left
them
alone
they
could
now
talk
freely
beatrice
by
her
frequent
glance
of
curiosity
seemed
to
await
some
explanation
of
a
visit
so
how
are
things
going
with
you
she
asked
at
length
tapping
the
ash
of
her
cigarette
over
a
plate
i
want
something
to
do
was
the
blunt
reply
too
much
alone
isn
t
that
it
just
what
i
thought
you
don
t
see
him
often
nancy
had
ceased
her
pretence
of
smoking
and
leaned
back
a
flush
on
her
face
and
something
unwonted
in
the
expression
of
her
eyes
something
like
a
smile
yet
touched
with
apathy
told
of
physical
influences
which
assisted
her
resolve
to
have
done
with
scruple
and
delicacy
she
handled
her
which
was
half
full
and
before
answering
raised
it
to
her
lips
no
i
don
t
see
him
well
i
told
you
to
come
to
me
if
i
could
be
any
use
what
s
your
idea
do
you
know
of
anything
i
could
do
it
isn
t
so
much
to
earn
money
as
to
to
be
occupied
and
escape
from
loneliness
but
i
must
have
two
afternoons
in
the
week
to
beatrice
nodded
and
smiled
no
not
for
that
nancy
added
hastily
to
see
my
the
other
appeared
to
accept
this
correction
all
right
i
think
i
can
find
you
something
we
re
opening
a
she
mentioned
the
locality
there
ll
be
a
like
at
headquarters
and
we
shall
want
some
one
ladylike
to
sit
there
and
answer
questions
you
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
see
any
one
that
knows
you
and
you
d
get
a
good
deal
of
fun
out
of
it
hours
from
ten
to
five
but
saturday
afternoon
off
and
wednesday
after
three
if
that
would
do
yes
that
would
do
very
well
any
payment
at
first
oh
we
wouldn
t
be
so
mean
as
all
that
say
ten
shillings
a
week
till
christmas
and
afterwards
we
could
see
she
laughed
whether
you
re
worth
i
know
nothing
about
you
can
learn
all
you
need
to
know
in
an
hour
it
s
the
ladylike
appearance
and
talk
more
than
anything
nancy
sipped
again
from
her
when
could
i
begin
the
place
ll
be
ready
on
monday
week
next
week
you
might
put
in
a
few
hours
with
us
just
sit
and
watch
and
listen
that
s
all
to
get
the
hang
of
the
thank
you
for
being
so
ready
to
help
not
a
bit
of
it
i
haven
t
done
yet
there
s
a
condition
if
i
fix
up
this
job
for
you
will
you
tell
me
something
i
want
to
know
nancy
turned
her
eyes
apprehensively
you
can
guess
what
it
is
i
quite
believe
what
you
told
me
some
time
ago
but
i
shan
t
feel
quite
easy
until
i
know
she
finished
the
sentence
with
a
look
nancy
s
eyes
fell
curiosity
nothing
else
added
the
other
just
to
make
quite
sure
it
isn
t
anybody
i
ve
thought
there
was
a
long
silence
leaning
forward
upon
the
table
nancy
turned
her
about
and
about
she
now
had
a
very
high
colour
and
breathed
quickly
is
it
off
then
said
beatrice
in
an
indifferent
tone
thereupon
nancy
disclosed
the
name
of
her
husband
her
lover
as
miss
french
thought
him
plied
with
further
questions
she
told
where
he
was
living
but
gave
no
account
of
the
circumstances
that
had
estranged
them
abundantly
satisfied
beatrice
grew
almost
affectionate
and
talked
merrily
nancy
wished
to
ask
whether
luckworth
crewe
had
any
knowledge
of
her
position
it
was
long
before
her
lips
could
utter
the
words
but
at
length
they
were
spoken
and
beatrice
assured
her
that
crewe
good
silly
fellow
did
not
even
suspect
the
truth
chapter
for
a
man
said
tarrant
who
can
pay
no
more
than
twelve
and
sixpence
a
week
it
s
the
best
accommodation
to
be
found
in
london
there
s
an
air
of
civilisation
about
the
house
look
a
bath
and
a
little
and
an
such
as
can
be
used
by
a
man
who
respects
himself
you
feel
you
are
among
people
who
tub
o
mornings
and
know
the
meaning
of
leisure
then
the
view
he
was
talking
to
his
friend
harvey
munden
the
journalist
the
room
in
which
they
stood
might
with
advantage
have
been
larger
but
as
a
it
served
well
enough
and
only
the
poverty
of
its
occupant
who
put
it
to
the
additional
use
of
and
study
made
the
lack
of
space
particularly
noticeable
the
window
afforded
a
prospect
pleasant
enough
to
eyes
such
as
theirs
above
the
lower
houses
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
way
appeared
tall
trees
in
the
sere
garb
of
later
autumn
growing
by
old
westminster
school
and
beyond
them
grey
in
twilight
rose
the
towers
of
the
abbey
from
this
point
of
view
no
vicinage
of
modern
brickwork
spoilt
their
charm
the
monitors
stood
alone
against
a
sky
of
ruddy
and
purple
cloud
the
old
adam
is
stronger
than
ever
in
me
he
pursued
if
i
were
condemned
for
life
to
the
united
states
i
should
go
mad
and
perish
in
an
attempt
to
swim
the
then
why
did
you
stay
so
long
i
could
have
stayed
with
advantage
even
longer
it
s
something
to
have
studied
with
tolerable
thoroughness
the
most
hateful
form
of
society
yet
developed
i
saw
it
at
first
as
a
man
does
who
is
living
at
his
ease
at
last
as
a
poor
devil
who
is
thankful
for
the
institution
of
free
lunches
i
went
and
i
came
back
as
a
steerage
passenger
it
has
been
a
year
well
it
had
made
him
in
aspect
more
than
a
older
his
lounging
attitude
the
spirit
of
his
talk
showed
that
he
was
unchanged
in
bodily
and
mental
habits
but
certain
lines
upon
his
visage
and
an
austerity
that
had
taken
the
place
of
youthful
signified
a
more
than
normal
progress
in
experience
do
you
know
said
munden
slyly
that
you
have
brought
back
a
accent
accent
the
devil
i
don
t
believe
intonation
at
all
tarrant
professed
a
serious
annoyance
if
that
s
true
i
ll
go
and
live
for
a
month
in
it
would
be
cheaper
to
join
a
socialist
club
in
the
east
end
but
just
tell
me
how
you
stand
how
long
can
you
hold
out
in
these
aristocratic
lodgings
till
christmas
i
m
ashamed
to
say
how
i
ve
got
the
money
so
don
t
ask
i
reached
london
with
empty
pockets
and
i
ll
tell
you
one
thing
i
have
learnt
munden
there
s
no
villainy
no
scoundrelism
no
baseness
conceivable
that
isn
t
excused
by
want
of
money
i
understand
the
whole
social
the
man
who
has
never
felt
the
perspiration
come
out
on
his
forehead
in
asking
himself
how
he
is
going
to
keep
body
and
soul
together
has
no
right
to
an
opinion
on
the
greatest
question
of
the
what
particular
scoundrelism
or
baseness
have
you
committed
asked
the
other
tarrant
averted
his
eyes
i
said
i
could
understand
such
one
sees
that
you
have
been
breathed
upon
by
i
loathe
the
word
and
the
thing
even
more
than
i
did
which
is
saying
a
good
be
it
so
you
say
you
are
going
to
work
yes
i
have
come
back
to
work
even
now
it
s
difficult
to
realise
that
i
must
work
or
starve
i
understand
how
fellows
who
have
unexpectedly
lost
their
income
go
through
life
sponging
on
relatives
and
friends
i
understand
how
an
educated
man
goes
sinking
through
all
the
social
grades
down
to
the
common
and
the
infirmary
and
i
honestly
believe
there
s
only
one
thing
that
saves
me
from
doing
and
what
s
that
i
can
t
tell
you
not
yet
at
all
i
always
thought
you
a
very
fine
specimen
of
the
man
born
to
do
nothing
said
munden
with
that
smile
which
permitted
him
a
surprising
candour
in
conversation
and
you
were
quite
right
returned
tarrant
with
a
laugh
i
am
a
born
artist
in
indolence
it
s
the
pity
of
pities
that
circumstances
will
frustrate
nature
s
you
think
you
can
support
yourself
by
journalism
i
must
run
your
eye
over
he
took
from
the
table
a
slip
of
manuscript
headed
a
reverie
in
wall
munden
read
it
sat
thoughtful
for
a
moment
and
laughed
devilish
savage
did
you
write
it
after
a
free
lunch
wrote
it
this
morning
shall
i
try
one
of
the
evening
papers
with
it
or
one
of
the
weeklies
munden
suggested
a
few
alterations
and
mentioned
the
journal
which
he
thought
might
possibly
find
room
for
such
a
bit
of
satire
done
anything
else
here
s
a
paper
the
commercial
prospects
of
the
let
me
after
reading
a
page
or
two
with
critically
wrinkled
forehead
munden
laid
it
down
seems
pretty
solid
libellous
too
i
should
say
you
ve
more
stuff
in
you
than
i
thought
all
right
go
come
and
dine
with
me
to
meet
a
man
who
may
be
i
can
t
i
dine
at
lady
pollard
who
is
she
didn
t
you
know
pollard
of
trinity
the
only
son
of
his
mother
and
she
a
next
day
can
t
i
dine
with
some
people
at
bedford
munden
lifted
his
eyebrows
at
this
rate
you
may
live
pretty
well
on
a
dress
suit
any
more
engagements
none
that
i
know
of
but
i
shall
accept
all
that
offer
i
m
hungry
for
the
society
of
decent
english
people
i
used
to
neglect
my
acquaintances
i
know
better
now
go
and
live
for
a
month
in
a
cheap
new
york
and
you
ll
come
out
with
a
wholesome
taste
for
english
to
enable
his
friend
to
read
tarrant
had
already
lit
a
lamp
munden
glancing
about
the
room
said
carelessly
do
you
still
possess
the
furniture
of
the
old
place
no
was
the
answer
given
with
annoyance
vawdrey
had
it
sold
for
pictures
books
and
all
the
of
course
i
m
sorry
for
it
but
i
thought
at
the
time
that
i
shouldn
t
return
to
england
for
some
you
never
said
anything
of
that
kind
to
no
i
didn
t
the
other
replied
gloomily
and
all
at
once
he
fell
into
so
taciturn
a
mood
that
his
companion
after
a
few
more
remarks
and
inquiries
rose
from
his
chair
to
leave
from
seven
to
nine
tarrant
sat
resolutely
at
his
table
and
covered
a
few
pages
with
the
kind
of
composition
which
now
came
most
easily
to
him
a
somewhat
virulent
sarcasm
he
found
pleasure
in
the
work
but
after
nine
o
clock
his
thoughts
strayed
to
matters
of
personal
interest
and
got
beyond
control
would
the
last
post
of
the
evening
bring
him
an
answer
to
a
letter
he
had
despatched
this
morning
at
length
he
laid
down
his
pen
and
listened
nervously
for
that
knock
which
at
one
time
or
another
is
to
all
men
a
sound
it
came
at
the
street
door
and
was
quickly
followed
by
a
tap
at
his
own
nancy
had
lost
no
time
in
replying
what
her
letter
might
contain
he
found
it
impossible
to
conjecture
reproaches
joyous
welcome
wrath
forgiveness
he
knew
her
so
imperfectly
that
he
could
not
feel
sure
even
as
to
the
probabilities
of
the
case
and
his
suspense
was
abundantly
justified
her
answer
came
upon
him
with
the
force
of
a
shock
totally
unexpected
he
read
the
lines
again
and
again
he
stared
at
the
his
first
sensation
was
one
of
painful
surprise
thereupon
succeeded
fiery
resentment
reason
put
in
a
modest
word
hinting
that
he
had
deserved
no
better
but
he
refused
to
listen
nothing
could
excuse
so
gross
an
insult
he
had
not
thought
nancy
capable
of
this
behaviour
tested
she
betrayed
the
vice
of
birth
her
imputation
upon
his
motive
in
marrying
her
was
sheer
vulgar
abuse
possible
only
on
vulgar
lips
well
and
good
now
he
knew
her
all
the
torment
of
conscience
he
had
suffered
was
needless
and
for
the
moment
he
experienced
a
great
relief
in
less
than
ten
minutes
letter
and
were
enclosed
in
a
new
envelope
and
addressed
back
again
to
the
sender
with
no
word
of
comment
she
must
interpret
him
as
she
could
and
would
he
went
out
and
threw
the
offensive
packet
into
the
nearest
receptacle
for
such
things
work
was
over
for
after
pacing
in
the
obscurity
of
dean
s
yard
until
his
pulse
had
recovered
a
normal
beat
he
issued
into
the
peopled
ways
and
turned
towards
westminster
bridge
despite
his
neglect
of
nancy
he
had
never
ceased
to
think
of
her
with
a
tenderness
which
in
his
own
judgment
signified
something
more
than
the
simple
fidelity
of
a
married
man
faithful
in
the
technical
sense
he
had
not
been
but
the
casual
amours
of
a
young
man
caused
him
no
nancy
s
image
remained
without
rival
in
his
mind
he
had
continued
to
acknowledge
her
claims
upon
him
and
from
time
to
time
to
think
of
her
with
a
lover
s
longing
as
he
only
wrote
when
prompted
by
such
a
mood
his
letters
however
unsatisfying
were
sincere
various
influences
conflicted
with
this
amiable
and
honourable
sentiment
the
desire
of
independence
which
had
speeded
him
away
from
england
still
accompanied
him
on
his
return
he
had
never
ceased
to
regret
his
marriage
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
without
this
legal
bondage
it
would
have
been
much
easier
to
play
a
manly
part
at
the
time
of
nancy
s
becoming
a
mother
were
she
frankly
his
mistress
he
would
not
be
keeping
thus
far
away
when
most
she
needed
the
consolation
of
his
presence
the
secret
marriage
condemned
him
to
a
course
of
shame
and
the
more
he
thought
of
it
the
more
he
marvelled
at
his
deliberate
complicity
in
such
a
fraud
when
poverty
began
to
make
itself
felt
when
he
was
actually
hampered
in
his
movements
by
want
of
money
this
form
of
indignity
more
than
any
galling
to
his
pride
intensified
the
impatience
with
which
he
remembered
that
he
could
no
longer
roam
the
world
as
an
adventurer
any
day
some
trivial
accident
might
oppress
him
with
the
burden
of
a
wife
and
child
who
looked
to
him
for
their
support
tarrant
the
married
man
unless
he
were
content
to
turn
simple
rogue
and
vagabond
must
make
for
himself
a
place
in
the
world
his
indolence
had
no
small
part
in
his
revolt
against
the
stress
of
such
a
consideration
the
climate
of
the
bahamas
by
no
means
tended
to
invigorate
him
and
in
the
united
states
he
found
so
much
to
observe
even
to
enjoy
that
the
necessity
of
effort
was
kept
out
of
sight
as
long
as
by
one
expedient
and
another
he
succeeded
in
procuring
means
to
live
upon
without
working
during
the
homeward
voyage
a
trial
such
as
he
had
never
known
amid
squalid
discomforts
which
enraged
even
more
than
they
disgusted
him
his
heart
softened
in
anticipation
of
a
meeting
with
nancy
and
of
the
sight
of
his
child
apart
from
his
in
whom
he
could
perceive
nothing
but
coarseness
and
vileness
he
spent
the
hours
in
longing
for
england
and
for
the
home
he
would
make
there
in
castigating
the
flagrant
faults
of
his
character
moderating
his
ambitions
and
endeavouring
to
find
a
way
out
of
the
numerous
grave
difficulties
with
which
his
future
was
beset
landed
he
rather
forgot
than
discarded
these
wholesome
meditations
what
he
had
first
to
do
was
so
very
unpleasant
and
taxed
so
rudely
his
that
he
insensibly
fell
back
again
into
the
rebellious
temper
choice
there
was
none
reaching
london
with
a
few
shillings
in
his
pocket
of
necessity
he
repaired
forthwith
to
mr
vawdrey
s
office
in
the
city
and
made
known
the
straits
into
which
he
had
fallen
now
my
dear
fellow
said
vawdrey
with
his
usual
how
much
have
you
had
of
me
since
you
started
for
the
bahamas
that
is
hardly
a
fair
question
tarrant
replied
endeavouring
not
to
hang
his
head
like
an
everyday
beggar
i
went
out
on
a
commission
true
but
after
you
ceased
to
be
a
commissioner
you
have
lent
me
seventy
pounds
living
in
the
states
is
expensive
what
i
got
for
my
furniture
has
gone
as
well
yet
i
certainly
haven
t
been
extravagant
and
for
the
last
month
or
two
i
lived
like
a
tramp
will
you
make
my
debt
to
you
a
round
hundred
it
shall
be
repaid
though
i
may
be
a
year
or
two
about
the
loan
was
granted
but
together
with
a
great
deal
of
unpalatable
counsel
having
found
his
lodging
tarrant
at
once
invested
ten
pounds
in
providing
himself
with
a
dress
suit
and
improving
his
ordinary
attire
he
had
sold
every
garment
he
could
spare
in
new
york
for
the
dress
suit
he
had
an
immediate
use
on
the
very
platform
of
euston
station
at
his
arrival
a
chance
meeting
with
one
of
his
old
college
friends
resulted
in
an
invitation
to
dine
and
even
had
not
policy
urged
him
to
make
the
most
of
such
acquaintances
he
was
in
no
mood
for
rejecting
a
summons
back
into
the
world
of
civilisation
postponing
the
purposed
letter
to
nancy
which
had
he
written
it
sooner
would
have
been
very
unlike
the
letter
he
subsequently
sent
he
equipped
himself
once
more
as
a
gentleman
and
spent
several
very
enjoyable
hours
in
looking
up
the
members
of
his
former
circle
hodiernals
and
others
only
to
harvey
munden
did
he
confide
something
of
the
anxieties
which
lay
beneath
his
assumed
lightheartedness
munden
was
almost
the
only
man
he
knew
for
whom
he
had
a
genuine
respect
renewal
of
intercourse
with
people
of
good
social
standing
made
him
more
than
ever
fretful
in
the
thought
that
he
had
clogged
himself
with
marriage
whatever
nancy
s
reply
to
his
announcement
that
he
was
home
again
he
would
have
read
it
with
discontent
to
have
the
fact
forced
upon
him
a
fact
he
seriously
believed
it
that
his
wife
could
not
be
depended
upon
even
for
elementary
generosity
of
thought
was
at
this
moment
especially
disastrous
it
weighed
the
balance
against
his
feelings
of
justice
and
humanity
hitherto
no
matter
how
he
acted
always
preponderant
over
the
baser
issues
of
character
and
circumstance
he
stood
leaning
upon
the
parapet
of
westminster
bridge
his
eyes
scanning
the
dark
facade
of
the
houses
of
parliament
how
would
the
strong
unscrupulous
really
ambitious
man
act
in
such
a
case
what
was
to
prevent
him
from
ignoring
the
fact
that
he
was
married
and
directing
his
course
precisely
as
he
would
have
done
if
poverty
had
come
upon
him
before
his
act
of
supreme
foolishness
journalism
must
have
been
his
refuge
then
as
now
but
society
would
have
held
out
to
him
the
hope
of
every
adventurer
a
marriage
with
some
woman
whose
wealth
and
connections
would
clear
an
upward
path
in
whatever
line
he
chose
to
follow
why
not
abandon
to
nancy
the
inheritance
it
would
degrade
him
to
share
and
so
purchase
back
his
freedom
the
bargain
might
be
made
a
strong
man
would
carry
it
through
and
ultimately
triumph
by
daring
all
risks
having
wrought
himself
to
this
point
of
insensate
revolt
he
quitted
his
on
the
bridge
and
walked
away
nancy
did
not
write
again
there
passed
four
or
five
days
and
tarrant
working
hard
as
well
as
enjoying
the
pleasures
of
society
made
up
his
mind
not
to
see
her
he
would
leave
events
to
take
their
course
a
heaviness
of
heart
often
troubled
him
but
he
resisted
it
and
told
himself
that
he
was
becoming
stronger
after
a
long
day
of
writing
he
addressed
a
packet
to
a
certain
periodical
and
went
out
to
post
it
no
sooner
had
he
left
the
house
than
a
woman
who
had
been
about
to
pass
him
on
the
pavement
abruptly
turned
round
and
hurriedly
walked
away
but
for
this
action
he
would
not
have
noticed
her
as
it
was
he
recognised
the
figure
and
an
impulse
which
allowed
of
no
reflection
brought
him
in
a
moment
to
her
side
in
the
street
a
face
could
with
difficulty
be
observed
but
nancy
s
features
were
unmistakable
to
the
eye
that
now
fell
upon
them
stop
and
let
me
speak
to
you
he
exclaimed
she
walked
only
the
more
quickly
and
he
was
obliged
to
take
her
by
the
arm
what
do
you
want
she
spoke
as
if
to
an
insolent
stranger
and
shook
off
his
grasp
if
you
have
nothing
to
say
to
me
why
are
you
here
here
i
suppose
the
streets
are
free
to
me
nothing
would
bring
you
to
great
college
street
if
you
didn
t
know
that
i
was
living
here
now
that
we
have
met
we
must
i
have
nothing
at
all
to
say
to
well
then
will
come
this
way
there
s
a
quiet
place
where
no
one
will
notice
nancy
kept
her
eyes
resolutely
averted
from
him
he
the
while
searched
her
face
with
eagerness
as
well
as
the
faint
rays
of
the
nearest
lamp
allowed
it
if
you
have
anything
to
say
you
must
say
it
it
s
no
use
then
go
your
way
and
i
ll
go
he
turned
and
walked
slowly
in
the
direction
of
dean
s
yard
there
was
the
sound
of
a
step
behind
him
and
when
he
had
come
into
the
dark
quiet
square
nancy
was
there
too
better
to
be
reasonable
said
tarrant
approaching
her
again
i
want
to
ask
you
why
you
answered
a
letter
with
vulgar
insult
the
insult
came
from
you
she
answered
in
a
shaking
voice
what
did
i
say
that
gave
you
offence
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
to
write
in
that
way
after
never
answering
my
letter
for
months
leaving
me
without
a
word
at
such
a
time
making
me
think
either
that
you
were
dead
or
that
you
would
never
let
me
hear
of
you
again
i
told
you
it
was
a
mere
note
just
to
let
you
know
i
was
back
i
said
you
should
hear
more
when
we
very
well
we
have
met
what
have
you
to
say
for
yourself
first
of
all
this
that
you
are
mistaken
in
supposing
i
should
ever
consent
to
share
your
money
the
thought
was
natural
to
you
no
doubt
but
i
see
things
from
a
different
point
of
his
cold
anger
completely
disguised
the
emotion
stirred
in
him
by
nancy
s
presence
had
he
not
spoken
thus
he
must
have
given
way
to
joy
and
tenderness
for
nancy
seemed
more
beautiful
than
the
memory
he
had
retained
of
her
and
even
at
such
a
juncture
she
was
far
from
exhibiting
the
gross
characteristics
attributed
to
her
by
his
rebellious
imagination
then
i
don
t
understand
were
her
next
words
why
you
wrote
to
me
again
at
there
are
many
things
in
me
that
you
don
t
understand
and
can
t
yes
i
think
so
that
s
why
i
see
no
use
in
our
tarrant
was
ashamed
of
what
he
had
said
a
meaningless
retort
which
covered
his
inability
to
speak
as
his
heart
prompted
at
all
events
i
wanted
to
see
you
and
it
s
fortunate
you
passed
just
as
i
was
coming
nancy
would
not
accept
the
conciliatory
phrase
i
hadn
t
the
least
intention
of
seeing
you
she
replied
it
was
a
curiosity
to
know
where
you
lived
nothing
else
i
shall
never
forgive
you
for
the
way
in
which
you
have
behaved
to
me
so
you
needn
t
try
to
explain
here
and
now
i
should
certainly
not
try
the
only
thing
i
will
say
about
myself
is
that
i
very
much
regret
not
having
made
known
that
you
were
married
to
me
when
plain
honesty
required
it
now
i
look
upon
it
as
something
over
and
done
with
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
shall
never
benefit
by
the
deception
she
interrupted
him
how
do
you
know
that
shall
benefit
by
it
how
can
you
tell
what
has
been
happening
since
you
last
heard
from
me
in
america
i
have
taken
it
for
granted
that
things
are
the
then
you
didn
t
even
take
measures
to
have
news
of
me
from
any
one
else
what
need
i
should
always
have
received
any
letter
you
you
thought
it
likely
that
i
should
appeal
to
you
if
i
were
in
he
stood
silent
glad
of
the
obscurity
which
made
it
needless
for
him
to
command
his
features
at
length
what
is
the
simple
fact
has
your
secret
been
discovered
or
not
how
does
it
concern
you
only
in
this
way
that
if
you
are
to
be
dependent
upon
any
one
it
must
be
upon
nancy
gave
a
scornful
laugh
that
s
very
generous
considering
your
position
but
happily
you
can
t
force
me
to
accept
your
generosity
any
more
than
i
can
compel
you
to
take
a
share
of
my
without
the
jibe
at
my
poverty
tarrant
said
that
is
a
sufficient
answer
as
we
can
t
even
pretend
to
be
friendly
with
each
other
i
am
very
glad
there
need
be
no
talk
of
our
future
relations
you
are
provided
for
and
no
doubt
will
take
care
not
to
lose
the
provision
if
ever
you
prefer
to
forget
that
we
are
legally
bound
i
shall
be
no
i
have
thought
of
that
replied
nancy
after
a
pause
her
voice
expressing
satisfaction
perhaps
we
should
do
better
to
make
the
understanding
at
once
you
are
quite
free
i
should
never
acknowledge
you
as
my
you
seriously
mean
it
do
i
seem
to
be
joking
very
well
i
won
t
say
that
i
should
never
acknowledge
you
as
my
wife
so
far
from
that
i
hold
myself
responsible
whenever
you
choose
to
make
any
kind
of
claim
upon
me
but
i
shall
not
dream
of
interfering
with
your
liberty
if
ever
you
wish
to
write
to
me
you
may
safely
address
to
the
house
at
champion
and
remember
always
he
added
sternly
that
it
was
not
i
who
made
such
a
parting
nancy
returned
his
look
through
the
gloom
and
said
in
like
tone
i
shall
do
my
best
never
to
think
of
it
at
all
fortunately
my
time
and
my
thoughts
are
how
tarrant
could
not
help
asking
as
she
turned
away
for
her
tone
implied
some
special
significance
in
the
words
you
have
no
right
to
ask
anything
whatever
about
me
came
from
nancy
who
was
already
moving
away
he
allowed
her
to
go
so
it
is
to
be
as
i
wished
he
said
to
himself
with
mock
courage
so
much
the
and
he
went
home
to
a
night
of
misery
chapter
not
long
after
the
disappearance
of
fanny
french
damerel
called
one
day
upon
luckworth
crewe
at
his
office
in
farringdon
street
crewe
seldom
had
business
with
ladies
and
few
things
could
have
surprised
him
more
than
a
visit
from
this
lady
in
particular
whom
he
knew
so
well
by
name
and
regarded
with
such
special
interest
she
introduced
herself
as
a
person
wishing
to
find
a
good
investment
for
a
small
capital
but
the
s
conversation
which
followed
became
in
the
end
almost
a
confidential
chat
damerel
spoke
of
her
nephew
horace
lord
with
whom
she
understood
crewe
was
on
terms
of
intimacy
she
professed
a
grave
solicitude
on
his
account
related
frankly
the
unhappy
circumstances
which
had
estranged
the
young
man
from
her
and
ultimately
asked
whether
crewe
could
not
make
it
worth
his
own
while
to
save
horace
from
the
shoals
of
idleness
and
pilot
him
into
some
safe
commercial
haven
this
meeting
was
the
first
of
many
between
the
fashionable
lady
and
the
keen
man
of
affairs
without
a
suspicion
of
how
it
had
come
about
horace
lord
presently
found
himself
an
informal
partner
in
crewe
s
business
he
invested
only
a
nominal
sum
which
might
be
looked
upon
as
a
premium
of
apprenticeship
but
there
was
an
understanding
that
at
the
close
of
the
term
of
tutelage
imposed
by
his
father
s
will
he
should
have
the
offer
of
a
genuine
partnership
on
very
inviting
terms
horace
was
not
sorry
to
enter
again
upon
regular
occupation
he
had
considerably
damaged
his
health
in
the
effort
to
live
up
to
his
ideal
of
thwarted
passion
and
could
no
longer
entertain
a
hope
that
fanny
s
escapade
was
consistent
with
innocence
having
learnt
how
money
slips
through
the
fingers
of
a
gentleman
with
fastidious
tastes
he
welcomed
a
prospect
of
increased
resources
and
applied
himself
with
some
energy
to
learning
his
new
business
but
with
damerel
he
utterly
refused
to
be
reconciled
and
of
his
sister
he
saw
very
little
nancy
however
approved
the
step
he
had
taken
and
said
she
would
be
content
to
know
that
all
was
well
with
him
upon
a
sunday
morning
when
the
church
bells
had
ceased
to
clang
luckworth
crewe
not
altogether
at
his
ease
in
garb
of
flagrant
respectability
sat
by
the
fireside
of
a
pleasant
little
room
conversing
with
damerel
their
subject
as
usual
at
the
beginning
of
talk
was
horace
lord
he
won
t
speak
of
you
at
all
said
crewe
in
a
voice
singularly
subdued
sympathetic
respectful
i
have
done
all
i
could
short
of
telling
him
that
i
know
you
he
s
very
touchy
still
on
that
old
how
would
he
like
it
asked
the
lady
if
you
told
him
that
we
are
acquaintances
impossible
to
say
perhaps
it
would
make
no
difference
one
way
or
damerel
was
strikingly
yet
becomingly
arrayed
the
past
year
had
dealt
no
less
gently
with
her
than
its
predecessors
if
anything
her
complexion
had
gained
in
brilliancy
perhaps
a
consequence
of
the
hygienic
precautions
due
to
her
fear
of
becoming
stout
a
stranger
even
a
specialist
in
the
matter
might
have
doubted
whether
the
fourth
decade
lay
more
than
a
month
or
two
behind
her
so
far
from
seeking
to
impress
her
visitor
with
a
pose
of
social
superiority
she
behaved
to
him
as
though
his
presence
honoured
as
much
as
it
delighted
her
look
tone
bearing
each
was
a
flattery
which
no
obtuseness
could
fail
to
apprehend
and
crewe
s
countenance
proved
him
anything
but
inappreciative
hitherto
she
had
spoken
and
listened
with
her
head
drooping
in
gentle
melancholy
now
with
a
sudden
change
intended
to
signify
the
native
buoyancy
of
her
disposition
she
uttered
a
rippling
laugh
which
showed
her
excellent
teeth
and
said
prettily
poor
boy
i
must
suffer
the
penalty
of
having
tried
to
save
him
from
one
of
my
own
not
she
added
that
i
foresaw
how
that
poor
silly
girl
would
justify
my
worst
fears
of
her
perhaps
her
head
drooping
again
i
ought
to
reproach
myself
with
what
i
don
t
see
that
at
all
replied
crewe
whose
eyes
lost
nothing
of
the
exhibition
addressed
to
them
even
if
you
had
been
the
cause
of
it
which
of
course
you
weren
t
i
should
have
said
you
had
done
the
right
thing
every
one
knew
what
fanny
french
must
come
isn
t
it
sad
a
pretty
girl
but
so
ill
brought
up
i
fear
can
you
give
me
any
news
of
her
sister
the
one
who
came
here
and
frightened
me
so
oh
she
s
going
on
as
crewe
checked
himself
and
showed
hesitation
she
almost
threatened
me
damerel
pursued
with
timid
sweetness
do
you
think
she
is
the
kind
of
person
to
plot
any
harm
against
one
she
had
better
not
try
it
on
said
crewe
in
his
natural
voice
then
as
if
recollecting
himself
he
pursued
more
softly
but
i
was
going
to
speak
of
her
you
haven
t
heard
that
miss
lord
has
taken
a
position
in
the
new
branch
of
that
dress
supply
association
damerel
kept
an
astonished
silence
there
can
t
be
any
doubt
of
it
i
have
been
told
on
the
best
authority
she
is
in
what
they
call
the
a
superintendent
it
s
a
queer
thing
what
can
have
led
her
to
it
i
must
make
inquiries
said
damerel
with
an
air
of
concern
how
sad
it
is
crewe
that
these
young
relatives
of
mine
almost
the
only
relatives
i
have
should
refuse
me
their
confidence
and
their
affection
pray
does
horace
know
of
what
his
sister
is
doing
i
thought
i
wouldn
t
speak
to
him
about
it
until
i
had
seen
how
very
kind
how
grateful
i
am
to
you
for
your
constant
thoughtfulness
why
crewe
should
have
practised
such
reticence
why
it
signified
kindness
and
thoughtfulness
to
damerel
neither
he
nor
she
could
easily
have
explained
but
their
eyes
met
with
diffident
admiration
on
the
one
side
and
touching
amiability
on
the
other
then
they
discussed
nancy
s
inexplicable
behaviour
from
every
point
of
view
or
rather
damerel
discussed
it
and
her
companion
made
a
pretence
of
doing
so
crewe
s
manner
had
become
patently
artificial
he
either
expressed
himself
in
trivial
phrases
which
merely
avoided
silence
or
betrayed
an
embarrassment
an
abstraction
which
caused
the
lady
to
observe
him
with
all
the
acuteness
at
her
command
you
haven
t
seen
her
lately
she
asked
when
crewe
had
been
staring
at
the
window
for
a
minute
or
two
seen
her
no
not
for
a
long
i
think
you
told
me
you
haven
t
called
there
since
lord
s
death
i
never
was
there
at
all
he
answered
abruptly
oh
i
remember
your
saying
so
of
course
there
is
no
reason
why
she
shouldn
t
go
into
business
if
time
is
heavy
on
her
hands
as
i
dare
say
it
may
be
so
many
ladies
prefer
to
have
an
occupation
of
that
kind
it
s
a
sign
of
progress
we
are
getting
more
sensible
society
used
to
have
such
silly
prejudices
even
within
my
recollection
how
quickly
things
change
no
lady
would
have
dreamt
of
permitting
her
daughter
to
take
an
engagement
in
a
shop
or
any
such
place
now
we
have
women
of
title
starting
as
milliners
and
modistes
and
soon
it
will
be
quite
a
common
thing
to
see
one
s
friends
behind
the
she
gave
a
gay
little
laugh
in
which
crewe
joined
unmelodiously
for
he
durst
not
be
merry
in
the
note
natural
to
him
then
raised
her
eyes
in
playful
appeal
if
ever
i
should
fall
into
misfortune
crewe
would
you
put
me
in
the
way
of
earning
my
you
couldn
t
you
re
above
all
that
kind
of
thing
it
s
for
the
rough
and
ready
sort
of
women
and
i
can
t
say
i
have
much
opinion
of
that
s
a
very
nice
little
compliment
but
at
the
same
time
it
s
rather
severe
on
the
women
who
are
tell
me
frankly
is
my
my
niece
one
of
the
people
you
haven
t
much
opinion
of
crewe
shuffled
his
feet
i
wasn
t
thinking
of
miss
but
what
is
really
your
opinion
of
her
damerel
urged
softly
crewe
looked
up
and
down
smiled
in
a
vacant
way
and
appeared
very
uncomfortable
may
i
guess
the
truth
said
his
playful
companion
no
i
ll
tell
you
i
wanted
to
marry
her
and
did
my
best
to
get
her
to
i
thought
so
she
paused
on
the
note
of
arch
satisfaction
and
mused
how
nice
of
you
to
confess
and
that
s
all
past
and
forgotten
is
it
never
man
more
unlike
himself
than
the
bold
in
this
colloquy
he
was
subdued
and
shy
his
usual
racy
and
virile
talk
had
given
place
to
an
insipid
mildness
he
seemed
bent
on
showing
that
the
graces
of
polite
society
were
not
so
strange
to
him
as
one
might
suppose
but
under
damerel
s
interrogation
a
restiveness
began
to
appear
in
him
and
at
length
he
answered
in
his
natural
blunt
voice
yes
it
s
all
over
and
for
a
good
the
lady
s
curiosity
was
still
more
provoked
no
she
exclaimed
laughingly
i
am
going
to
ask
the
reason
that
would
be
presuming
too
far
on
crewe
fixed
his
eyes
on
a
corner
of
the
room
and
seemed
to
look
there
for
a
solution
of
some
difficulty
when
the
silence
had
lasted
more
than
a
minute
he
began
to
speak
slowly
and
awkwardly
i
ve
half
a
mind
to
in
fact
i
ve
been
thinking
that
you
ought
to
the
good
reason
yes
you
re
the
only
one
that
could
stand
in
the
place
of
a
mother
to
her
and
i
don
t
think
she
ought
to
be
living
alone
like
she
is
with
no
one
to
advise
and
help
i
have
felt
that
very
strongly
said
damerel
the
old
servant
who
is
with
her
can
t
be
at
all
a
suitable
companion
that
is
to
be
treated
on
equal
terms
a
very
strange
arrangement
indeed
but
you
don
t
mean
that
you
thought
less
well
of
her
because
she
is
living
in
that
way
of
course
not
it
s
something
a
good
deal
more
serious
than
damerel
became
suddenly
grave
then
i
certainly
ought
to
you
ought
i
think
it
very
likely
she
would
have
been
glad
enough
to
make
a
friend
of
you
if
it
hadn
t
been
for
this
this
affair
which
stood
in
the
way
there
can
t
be
any
harm
in
telling
you
as
you
couldn
t
wish
anything
but
her
that
surely
you
may
take
for
well
then
i
have
an
idea
that
she
s
trying
to
earn
money
because
some
one
is
getting
all
he
can
out
of
her
leaving
her
very
little
for
herself
and
if
so
it
s
time
you
the
listener
was
so
startled
that
she
changed
colour
you
mean
that
some
man
has
her
in
his
power
if
i
m
not
mistaken
it
comes
to
that
but
for
her
father
s
will
she
would
have
been
married
long
ago
and
she
ought
to
having
blurted
out
these
words
crewe
felt
much
more
at
ease
as
damerel
s
eyes
fell
the
sense
of
sexual
predominance
awoke
in
him
and
he
was
no
longer
so
prostrate
before
the
lady
s
natural
and
artificial
graces
how
do
you
know
this
she
asked
in
an
undertone
from
some
one
who
had
it
from
miss
lord
are
you
quite
sure
that
it
isn
t
a
malicious
falsehood
as
sure
as
i
am
that
i
sit
here
i
know
the
man
s
name
and
where
he
lives
and
all
about
him
and
i
know
where
the
child
is
at
nurse
the
child
oh
surely
never
a
genuine
agitation
possessed
her
she
had
a
frightened
look
and
moved
as
if
she
must
act
without
delay
it
s
nearly
six
months
old
crewe
continued
of
course
that
s
why
she
was
away
so
but
why
haven
t
you
told
me
this
before
it
was
your
duty
to
tell
me
your
plain
duty
how
long
have
you
known
i
heard
of
it
first
of
all
about
three
months
ago
but
it
was
only
the
other
day
that
i
was
told
the
man
s
name
and
other
things
about
is
it
known
to
many
people
is
the
poor
girl
talked
about
no
no
crewe
replied
with
confidence
the
person
who
told
me
is
the
only
one
who
has
found
it
out
you
may
depend
upon
it
must
be
a
woman
said
damerel
sharply
yes
it
s
a
woman
some
one
know
very
well
she
told
me
just
because
she
thought
i
was
still
hoping
to
marry
miss
lord
and
well
the
truth
is
though
we
re
good
friends
she
has
a
little
spite
against
me
and
i
suppose
it
amused
her
to
tell
me
something
i
have
no
doubt
said
damerel
that
the
secret
has
been
betrayed
to
a
dozen
i
ll
go
bail
it
hasn
t
returned
crewe
falling
into
his
vernacular
i
can
hardly
believe
it
at
all
i
should
never
have
dreamt
that
such
a
thing
was
possible
what
is
the
man
s
name
what
is
his
position
tarrant
is
his
name
and
he
s
related
somehow
to
a
vawdrey
well
known
in
the
city
who
has
a
big
house
over
at
champion
hill
i
have
no
notion
how
they
came
together
or
how
long
it
was
going
on
but
this
tarrant
has
been
in
america
for
a
year
i
understand
has
only
just
come
back
and
now
he
s
living
in
poorish
lodgings
great
college
street
westminster
i
ve
made
a
few
inquiries
about
him
but
i
can
t
get
at
very
much
a
man
who
knows
vawdrey
tells
me
that
tarrant
has
no
means
and
that
he
s
a
loafing
affected
sort
of
chap
if
that
s
true
and
it
seems
likely
from
the
way
he
s
living
of
course
he
will
be
ready
enough
to
marry
miss
lord
when
the
proper
time
has
come
i
m
only
afraid
that
s
all
he
had
in
view
from
the
first
and
i
can
t
help
suspecting
as
i
said
that
she
s
supporting
him
now
if
not
why
should
she
go
and
work
in
a
shop
at
all
events
a
decent
man
wouldn
t
allow
her
to
do
a
decent
man
said
the
listener
would
never
have
allowed
her
to
fall
into
certainly
not
crewe
assented
with
energy
and
as
for
my
keeping
quiet
about
it
damerel
you
ve
only
to
think
what
an
awkward
affair
it
was
to
mention
i
m
quite
sure
you
ll
have
a
little
feeling
against
me
because
i
knew
of
it
i
beg
you
not
to
think
that
she
returned
to
her
manner
of
suave
friendliness
i
shall
owe
you
gratitude
for
telling
me
and
nothing
but
gratitude
you
have
behaved
with
very
great
delicacy
i
can
not
say
how
highly
i
appreciate
your
feeling
on
the
poor
girl
s
if
i
can
be
of
any
use
i
am
always
at
your
thank
you
dear
crewe
thank
you
in
you
i
have
found
a
real
friend
and
how
rarely
they
are
met
with
of
course
i
shall
make
inquiries
at
once
my
niece
must
be
protected
a
helpless
girl
in
that
dreadful
position
may
commit
follies
i
fear
you
are
right
he
is
making
her
his
victim
with
such
a
secret
she
is
absolutely
at
his
mercy
and
it
explains
why
she
has
shunned
me
oh
do
you
think
her
brother
knows
it
i
m
quite
sure
he
doesn
t
hasn
t
the
least
of
course
not
but
it
s
wonderful
how
she
has
escaped
your
informant
how
did
she
find
it
out
you
say
she
had
the
story
from
the
girl
s
own
lips
but
why
she
must
have
shown
that
she
knew
crewe
imparted
such
details
as
had
come
to
his
knowledge
they
were
meagre
and
left
many
obscurities
but
damerel
rewarded
him
with
effusive
gratitude
and
strengthened
the
spell
which
she
had
cast
upon
this
knight
of
farringdon
street
chapter
every
day
tarrant
said
to
himself
i
am
a
free
man
i
was
only
married
in
a
every
night
he
thought
of
nancy
and
suffered
heartache
he
thought
too
of
nancy
s
child
his
own
son
that
nancy
was
a
tender
mother
he
knew
from
the
letter
she
had
written
him
after
the
baby
s
birth
a
letter
he
would
have
liked
to
read
again
but
forbore
must
not
the
separation
from
her
child
be
hard
if
he
saw
the
poor
little
mortal
how
would
the
sight
affect
him
at
moments
he
felt
a
longing
perhaps
definable
as
the
instinct
of
paternity
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
grow
sentimental
over
babies
his
own
or
other
people
s
irony
and
sarcasm
very
agreeable
to
a
certain
class
of
newspaper
readers
were
just
now
his
and
he
could
not
afford
to
indulge
any
softer
mode
of
meditation
his
acquaintances
agreed
that
the
year
of
absence
had
not
improved
him
he
was
alarmingly
clever
he
talked
well
but
his
amiability
the
poetry
of
his
mind
seemed
to
have
been
lost
in
america
he
could
no
longer
admire
or
praise
for
his
own
part
he
did
not
clearly
perceive
this
change
it
struck
him
only
that
the
old
friends
were
less
interesting
than
he
had
thought
them
and
he
looked
for
reception
in
circles
better
able
to
appreciate
his
epigrams
and
paradoxes
a
few
weeks
of
such
life
broke
him
so
completely
to
harness
that
he
forgot
the
seasonable
miseries
which
had
been
wont
to
drive
him
from
london
at
the
approach
of
november
when
the
first
fog
blackened
against
his
windows
he
merely
lit
the
lamp
and
wrote
on
indifferent
two
years
ago
he
had
declared
that
a
london
november
would
fatally
blight
his
soul
that
he
must
flee
to
a
land
of
sunshine
or
perish
there
was
little
time
now
to
think
about
his
soul
one
monday
morning
arrived
a
letter
which
surprised
and
disturbed
him
it
ran
thus
mrs
eustace
damerel
presents
her
compliments
to
tarrant
and
would
take
it
as
a
great
favour
if
he
could
call
upon
her
either
or
tuesday
at
any
hour
between
three
and
seven
she
particularly
desires
to
see
tarrant
on
a
private
matter
of
mutual
now
this
could
have
but
one
meaning
eustace
damerel
was
of
course
nancy
s
relative
from
nancy
herself
or
in
some
other
way
she
must
have
learnt
the
fact
of
his
marriage
probably
from
nancy
since
she
knew
where
he
lived
he
was
summoned
to
a
judicial
interview
happily
attendance
was
not
compulsory
second
thoughts
advised
him
that
he
had
better
accept
the
invitation
he
must
know
what
measures
were
in
progress
against
him
if
nancy
had
already
broken
her
word
she
might
be
disposed
to
revenge
herself
in
every
way
that
would
occur
to
an
angry
woman
of
small
refinement
she
might
make
life
in
london
impossible
for
him
he
sat
down
and
penned
a
reply
saying
that
he
would
call
upon
damerel
at
five
but
he
did
not
post
this
after
all
a
day
s
delay
would
only
irritate
him
better
to
go
this
afternoon
in
which
case
it
was
not
worth
while
sending
an
answer
it
seemed
to
him
very
probable
that
nancy
would
be
with
her
aunt
to
confront
him
if
so
if
indeed
she
were
going
to
act
like
any
coarse
woman
with
no
regard
but
for
her
own
passions
and
interests
he
would
at
least
have
the
consolation
of
expelling
from
his
mind
at
once
and
for
ever
her
haunting
image
damerel
who
during
the
past
twelve
months
had
changed
her
abode
times
now
occupied
private
lodgings
in
tyburnia
on
his
admittance
tarrant
sat
alone
for
nearly
five
minutes
in
a
pretentiously
furnished
room
just
the
room
in
which
he
had
expected
to
find
nancy
s
relative
the
delay
and
the
surroundings
exasperated
his
nervous
mood
so
that
when
the
lady
entered
he
behaved
with
slighter
courtesy
than
became
his
breeding
nothing
in
her
appearance
surprised
or
interested
him
there
was
a
distant
facial
resemblance
to
nancy
natural
in
her
mother
s
sister
there
was
expensive
though
not
particularly
tasteful
dress
and
a
gait
a
manner
distinguishable
readily
enough
from
what
they
aimed
at
displaying
the
grace
of
a
woman
born
to
social
privilege
it
would
be
a
humiliating
conversation
tarrant
braced
himself
to
go
through
with
it
he
stood
stiffly
while
his
hostess
regarded
him
with
shrewd
eyes
she
had
merely
bent
her
head
will
you
sit
down
tarrant
he
took
a
chair
without
speaking
i
think
you
know
me
by
name
i
have
heard
of
a
some
time
ago
i
suppose
and
in
that
you
have
the
advantage
of
me
i
heard
your
name
yesterday
for
the
first
it
was
the
sharp
rejoinder
of
a
woman
of
the
world
tarrant
began
to
perceive
that
he
had
to
do
with
intelligence
and
would
not
be
allowed
to
perform
his
share
of
the
talking
haut
en
in
what
can
i
be
of
service
to
you
he
asked
with
constrained
civility
you
can
tell
me
please
what
sort
of
connection
there
is
between
you
and
my
niece
miss
damerel
was
obviously
annoyed
by
his
demeanour
and
made
little
effort
to
disguise
her
feeling
she
gave
him
the
look
of
one
who
does
not
mean
to
be
trifled
with
really
answered
the
young
man
with
a
smile
i
don
t
know
what
authority
you
have
to
make
such
inquiries
you
are
not
i
believe
miss
lord
s
no
but
i
am
her
only
relative
who
can
act
on
her
behalf
where
knowledge
of
the
world
is
required
as
a
gentleman
you
will
bear
this
in
mind
it
s
quite
true
that
i
can
t
oblige
you
to
tell
me
anything
but
when
i
say
that
i
haven
t
spoken
even
to
my
niece
of
what
i
have
heard
and
haven
t
communicated
with
the
gentlemen
who
her
guardians
i
think
you
will
see
that
i
am
not
acting
in
a
way
you
ought
to
you
mean
damerel
that
what
passes
between
us
is
in
confidence
i
only
mean
tarrant
that
i
am
giving
you
an
opportunity
of
explaining
yourself
so
that
i
can
keep
the
matter
private
if
your
explanation
is
you
have
a
charge
of
some
kind
to
bring
against
me
said
tarrant
composedly
i
must
first
of
all
hear
what
it
is
the
prisoner
at
the
bar
can
t
be
prosecuting
counsel
at
the
same
do
you
acknowledge
that
you
are
on
intimate
terms
with
miss
lord
i
have
known
her
for
a
year
or
tarrant
began
to
exercise
caution
nancy
had
no
hand
in
this
matter
some
one
had
told
tales
about
her
that
was
all
he
must
learn
without
committing
himself
exactly
how
much
had
been
discovered
are
you
engaged
to
her
engaged
to
marry
her
he
saw
in
damerel
s
clear
eye
that
she
convicted
him
of
ambiguities
you
have
not
even
made
her
a
promise
of
marriage
how
much
simpler
if
you
would
advance
a
clear
charge
i
will
answer
it
damerel
seemed
to
weigh
the
value
of
this
undertaking
tarrant
met
her
gaze
with
steady
indifference
it
may
only
be
a
piece
of
scandal
a
mistake
or
a
malicious
invention
i
have
been
told
that
that
you
are
in
everything
but
law
my
niece
s
they
regarded
each
other
during
a
moment
s
silence
tarrant
s
look
indicated
rapid
and
anxious
thought
it
seems
he
said
at
length
that
you
have
no
great
faith
in
the
person
who
told
you
it
is
the
easiest
matter
in
the
world
to
find
out
whether
the
story
is
true
or
not
inquiries
at
falmouth
would
be
quite
sufficient
i
dare
say
i
give
you
the
opportunity
of
keeping
it
quiet
that
s
you
won
t
care
to
let
me
know
who
told
you
there
s
no
reason
why
i
shouldn
t
said
damerel
after
reflection
do
you
know
luckworth
crewe
i
don
t
think
i
ever
heard
the
indeed
he
is
well
acquainted
with
miss
lord
some
one
he
wouldn
t
mention
gave
him
all
the
particulars
having
learnt
them
from
miss
lord
herself
and
he
thought
it
his
duty
to
inform
me
of
my
niece
s
very
painful
who
is
this
man
tarrant
asked
abruptly
i
am
rather
surprised
you
have
never
heard
of
him
he
s
a
man
of
business
my
nephew
horace
lord
is
shortly
to
be
in
partnership
with
crewe
no
the
name
is
quite
strange
to
tarrant
s
countenance
darkened
he
paused
for
an
instant
then
added
impatiently
you
say
he
had
all
the
what
were
they
these
particulars
will
one
be
enough
a
child
was
born
at
falmouth
and
is
now
at
a
place
just
outside
london
in
the
care
of
some
the
source
of
this
information
might
or
might
not
be
nancy
herself
in
either
case
there
was
no
further
hope
of
secrecy
tarrant
abandoned
his
reserve
and
spoke
quietly
civilly
so
far
you
have
heard
the
truth
what
have
you
to
ask
of
me
now
you
have
been
abroad
for
a
long
time
i
think
for
about
a
does
that
mean
that
you
wished
to
see
no
more
of
her
that
i
deserted
her
in
plain
words
it
meant
nothing
of
the
you
are
aware
then
that
she
has
taken
a
place
in
a
house
of
business
just
as
if
she
thought
it
necessary
to
earn
her
own
living
tarrant
displayed
astonishment
i
am
aware
of
no
such
thing
how
long
has
that
been
going
on
then
you
don
t
see
her
i
have
seen
her
but
she
told
me
nothing
of
there
s
something
very
strange
in
this
tarrant
you
seem
to
me
to
be
speaking
the
truth
no
please
don
t
take
offence
before
i
saw
you
you
were
a
total
stranger
to
me
and
after
what
i
had
heard
i
couldn
t
think
very
well
of
you
i
may
as
well
confess
that
you
seem
a
different
kind
of
man
from
what
i
expected
i
don
t
wish
to
offend
you
far
from
it
if
we
can
talk
over
this
distressing
affair
in
a
friendly
way
so
much
the
better
i
have
nothing
whatever
in
view
but
to
protect
my
niece
to
do
the
best
that
can
be
done
for
that
i
have
taken
for
granted
tarrant
replied
i
understand
that
you
expected
to
meet
a
scoundrel
of
a
very
recognisable
type
well
i
am
not
exactly
that
but
what
particular
act
of
rascality
have
you
in
mind
something
worse
than
mere
seduction
of
will
you
answer
a
disagreeable
question
are
you
anything
but
indeed
and
you
can
form
no
idea
why
nancy
has
gone
to
work
in
a
shop
tarrant
raised
his
eyebrows
i
see
he
said
deliberately
you
suspect
that
i
have
been
taking
money
from
her
i
suspect
it
now
it
seems
to
me
more
many
thanks
he
answered
with
cold
irony
so
the
situation
was
this
miss
lord
had
been
led
astray
by
a
rascally
fellow
who
not
only
left
her
to
get
on
as
best
she
could
but
lived
on
her
income
so
that
she
had
at
length
to
earn
money
for
her
own
needs
there
s
something
very
clear
and
rounded
very
dramatic
about
that
what
i
should
like
to
know
is
whether
miss
lord
tells
the
story
in
this
i
can
t
say
that
she
does
i
think
it
was
crewe
who
explained
things
like
i
am
obliged
to
crewe
but
he
may
after
all
only
repeat
what
he
has
heard
it
s
a
pity
we
don
t
know
miss
lord
s
actual
of
course
you
have
received
assistance
from
her
tarrant
stared
for
a
moment
then
laughed
unpleasantly
i
have
no
recollection
of
another
disagreeable
question
did
you
really
go
away
and
leave
her
to
get
on
as
best
she
could
he
looked
darkly
at
her
and
if
i
did
wasn
t
it
rather
unaccountable
behaviour
in
a
gentleman
i
can
t
believe
it
there
is
something
yes
there
something
mrs
damerel
i
should
have
thought
you
would
naturally
speak
first
to
your
niece
why
did
you
send
for
me
before
doing
so
to
find
out
what
sort
of
man
you
were
so
that
i
should
be
able
to
form
my
own
opinion
of
what
nancy
chose
to
tell
me
perhaps
she
may
refuse
to
tell
me
anything
at
all
we
are
not
like
ordinary
relatives
i
am
sorry
to
say
but
i
dare
say
you
know
better
than
i
do
how
she
thinks
of
i
have
heard
her
speak
of
you
only
once
or
twice
at
all
events
now
that
you
are
prepared
you
will
go
and
see
her
i
must
it
would
be
wrong
to
stand
by
and
do
and
you
will
see
her
guardians
that
must
depend
i
certainly
shall
if
she
seems
to
be
suffering
hardships
i
must
know
why
she
goes
out
to
work
as
if
she
were
pinched
for
money
there
is
her
child
to
support
of
course
but
that
wouldn
t
make
any
difference
to
her
she
is
well
provided
yes
there
s
no
choice
but
to
fall
back
upon
the
villain
he
rose
and
took
up
his
hat
you
mustn
t
go
yet
tarrant
said
his
hostess
firmly
i
have
said
that
i
can
t
believe
such
things
of
you
if
you
would
only
explain
that
s
just
what
i
can
t
do
it
s
as
much
a
mystery
to
me
as
to
you
her
wishing
to
earn
i
was
going
to
say
if
you
would
only
explain
your
intentions
as
to
the
future
my
intentions
will
depend
entirely
on
what
i
hear
from
your
niece
i
shall
see
her
as
soon
as
possible
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
at
what
hour
she
returns
from
business
no
i
can
t
i
wish
you
would
talk
a
little
his
eyes
flashed
angrily
mrs
damerel
i
have
said
all
that
i
am
willing
to
say
what
you
have
heard
is
partly
true
you
probably
won
t
have
to
wait
very
long
for
the
rest
of
the
story
but
i
have
no
time
and
no
inclination
to
tell
it
go
and
see
your
niece
by
all
means
or
her
guardians
if
it
seems
necessary
i
am
very
sorry
we
are
parting
in
this
you
must
remember
how
difficult
it
is
to
keep
one
s
temper
under
certain
kinds
of
i
don
t
accuse
well
then
to
explain
calmly
that
one
couldn
t
commit
this
or
that
sordid
rascality
it
comes
to
the
same
thing
however
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
opening
my
eyes
i
have
got
into
a
very
foolish
position
and
i
promise
you
i
will
get
out
of
it
as
quickly
as
may
whereupon
he
bowed
his
and
withdrew
chapter
it
was
not
yet
dark
but
had
begun
to
flare
and
flicker
in
the
gust
of
a
cold
damp
evening
a
thin
and
slippery
mud
smeared
the
pavement
tarrant
had
walked
mechanically
as
far
as
to
the
top
of
park
lane
before
he
began
to
consider
his
immediate
course
among
the
people
who
stood
waiting
for
omnibuses
he
meditated
thus
she
may
not
get
home
until
seven
or
then
she
will
have
a
meal
i
had
better
put
it
off
till
about
eight
that
leaves
me
some
four
hours
to
dispose
of
first
of
all
i
ll
walk
home
and
yes
by
all
the
devils
i
ll
finish
that
bit
of
writing
a
year
ago
i
could
no
more
have
done
it
under
such
circumstances
than
have
built
a
suspension
bridge
i
will
just
to
show
that
i
ve
some
grit
in
down
park
lane
and
by
buckingham
palace
across
to
westminster
he
kept
his
thoughts
for
the
most
part
on
that
bit
of
writing
only
thus
could
he
save
himself
from
an
access
of
fury
which
would
only
have
injured
him
the
ire
of
shame
in
which
a
man
is
tempted
to
beat
his
head
against
stone
walls
he
composed
aloud
balancing
many
a
pretty
antithesis
and
polishing
more
than
one
lively
paradox
in
his
the
fire
had
gone
out
no
matter
he
would
write
in
the
cold
it
was
mere
amanuensis
work
penning
at
the
dictation
of
his
sarcastic
demon
was
he
a
sybarite
many
a
poor
scribbler
has
earned
bed
and
breakfast
with
numb
fingers
the
fire
in
his
body
would
serve
him
for
an
hour
or
two
so
he
sat
down
and
achieved
his
task
to
the
last
syllable
he
read
it
through
corrected
it
made
it
up
for
post
and
rose
with
the
plaudits
of
conscience
who
shall
say
now
that
i
am
a
fop
and
a
weakling
seven
good
just
time
enough
to
appease
his
hunger
and
reach
grove
lane
by
the
suitable
hour
he
went
out
to
the
little
which
was
his
resort
in
spartan
moods
ate
with
considerable
appetite
and
walked
over
westminster
bridge
to
the
camberwell
tram
to
kill
time
on
the
journey
he
bought
a
halfpenny
paper
as
he
ascended
grove
lane
his
heart
throbbed
more
than
the
exercise
warranted
at
the
door
of
the
house
which
he
had
never
yet
entered
and
which
he
had
not
looked
upon
for
more
than
a
year
he
stood
to
calm
himself
with
lips
set
and
cheek
pale
in
the
darkness
then
a
confident
peal
at
the
knocker
it
was
mary
who
opened
he
had
never
seen
her
but
knew
that
this
grave
person
not
totally
unlike
a
born
gentlewoman
must
be
mary
woodruff
and
in
her
eyes
he
read
a
suspicion
of
his
own
identity
is
miss
lord
at
home
he
asked
in
a
way
what
name
shall
i
mention
mr
her
eyes
fell
and
she
requested
him
to
enter
to
wait
in
the
hall
for
a
moment
then
went
upstairs
she
was
absent
for
a
few
minutes
and
on
returning
asked
him
to
follow
her
she
led
to
the
on
the
way
tarrant
felt
a
surprise
that
in
so
small
a
house
the
should
be
correctly
situated
on
the
upper
floor
here
he
had
again
to
wait
a
comfortable
room
he
thought
and
with
a
true
air
of
home
about
it
he
knew
how
significant
is
this
impression
first
received
on
entering
a
strange
abode
home
or
encampment
attraction
or
repulsion
according
to
the
mind
of
the
woman
who
rules
there
was
it
nancy
or
mary
who
made
the
atmosphere
of
the
house
the
door
opened
and
he
faced
towards
it
nancy
s
dress
had
an
emphasis
of
fashion
formerly
unknown
to
it
appropriate
enough
considering
her
new
occupation
the
flush
upon
her
cheeks
the
light
of
doubtful
meaning
in
her
eyes
gave
splendour
to
a
beauty
matured
by
motherhood
in
the
dark
street
a
fortnight
ago
tarrant
could
hardly
be
said
to
have
seen
her
he
gazed
in
wonder
and
admiration
what
has
brought
you
here
a
cause
quite
this
is
a
little
house
can
we
talk
without
being
overheard
you
can
shout
if
you
wish
to
she
answered
flippantly
the
servant
is
out
and
mary
is
nancy
did
not
seat
herself
and
offered
no
seat
to
the
visitor
why
have
you
made
yourself
a
i
didn
t
know
that
i
i
am
told
you
go
daily
to
some
shop
or
i
am
engaged
at
a
place
of
business
but
i
don
however
that
doesn
t
matter
what
business
is
it
of
yours
who
is
luckworth
crewe
nancy
kept
her
eyes
still
more
resolutely
fronting
his
severe
look
a
man
i
used
to
you
don
t
see
him
it
s
many
months
since
i
saw
who
then
is
the
woman
who
has
told
him
your
whole
story
with
embellishments
and
who
says
she
has
had
it
from
you
yourself
nancy
was
speechless
i
don
t
say
there
is
any
such
person
tarrant
continued
the
man
may
have
lied
in
that
particular
but
he
has
somehow
got
to
know
a
good
deal
about
you
where
and
when
your
child
was
born
where
it
is
now
where
i
live
and
so
on
and
all
this
he
has
reported
to
your
aunt
to
her
how
do
you
know
for
answer
he
held
out
damerel
s
note
of
invitation
then
added
i
have
been
with
her
this
afternoon
she
is
coming
to
offer
you
her
protection
against
the
scoundrel
who
has
ruined
you
and
who
is
now
living
upon
what
do
you
mean
that
s
the
form
the
story
has
taken
either
in
crewe
s
mind
or
in
that
of
the
woman
who
told
it
to
don
t
they
know
that
i
am
married
evidently
and
they
think
you
are
having
money
from
me
that
s
how
they
explain
your
taking
a
place
in
a
nancy
laughed
and
laughed
again
how
ridiculous
i
m
glad
you
can
get
amusement
out
of
it
perhaps
you
can
suggest
how
the
joke
began
she
moved
a
few
steps
then
turned
again
to
him
yes
i
know
who
the
woman
must
be
it
s
beatrice
a
bosom
friend
of
yours
of
nothing
of
the
but
you
have
taken
her
into
your
confidence
up
to
a
certain
point
yes
i
have
told
her
and
she
told
crewe
i
understand
that
well
what
does
it
matter
tarrant
was
at
a
loss
to
interpret
this
singular
levity
he
had
never
truly
believed
that
reading
of
nancy
s
character
by
means
of
which
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
his
marriage
was
an
unmitigated
calamity
and
a
final
parting
between
them
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
his
memories
of
her
and
the
letters
she
had
written
him
coloured
her
personality
far
otherwise
yet
was
not
the
harsh
judgment
after
all
the
true
one
it
doesn
t
matter
to
you
he
said
that
people
think
you
an
unmarried
mother
that
people
are
talking
about
you
with
grins
and
sneers
nancy
reddened
in
angry
shame
let
them
talk
she
exclaimed
violently
what
does
it
matter
so
long
as
they
don
t
know
i
m
married
so
long
as
they
don
t
know
how
came
you
to
tell
this
woman
do
you
suppose
i
told
her
for
amusement
she
found
out
what
had
happened
at
falmouth
found
out
simply
by
going
down
there
and
making
inquiries
because
she
suspected
me
of
some
secret
affair
with
a
man
she
wants
to
marry
herself
this
crewe
the
wonder
of
wonders
is
that
no
one
else
got
to
know
of
it
in
that
way
any
one
who
cared
much
what
happened
to
me
would
have
seen
the
all
but
impossibility
of
keeping
such
a
it
is
a
notable
instance
of
evolutionary
process
that
the
female
mind
in
wrath
flies
to
just
those
logical
ineptitudes
which
most
surely
exasperate
the
male
intelligence
tarrant
gave
a
laugh
of
irate
scorn
why
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
i
cared
particularly
whether
your
secret
was
discovered
or
not
that
i
only
married
you
in
the
hope
of
profiting
by
it
wouldn
t
any
woman
think
so
i
hope
not
i
believe
there
are
some
women
who
don
t
rush
naturally
to
a
base
did
i
nancy
exclaimed
with
a
vehement
passion
that
made
her
breast
heave
didn
t
i
give
you
time
enough
believe
in
you
until
i
could
believe
no
longer
the
note
of
her
thrilling
voice
went
to
tarrant
s
heart
and
his
head
drooped
that
may
be
true
he
said
gravely
but
go
on
with
your
explanation
this
woman
came
to
you
and
told
you
what
she
had
discovered
and
you
allowed
her
to
think
you
unmarried
what
choice
had
i
how
was
my
child
to
be
brought
up
if
i
lost
everything
good
god
nancy
did
you
imagine
i
should
leave
you
to
starve
his
emotion
his
utterance
of
her
name
caused
her
to
examine
him
with
a
kind
of
wonder
how
did
i
know
how
could
i
tell
at
that
time
whether
you
were
alive
or
dead
i
had
to
think
of
myself
and
the
my
poor
girl
the
words
fell
from
him
involuntarily
nancy
s
look
became
as
scornful
and
defiant
as
before
oh
that
was
nothing
i
ve
gone
through
a
good
deal
more
than
stop
tell
me
this
have
you
in
your
anger
anger
natural
enough
allowed
yourself
to
speak
to
any
one
about
me
in
the
way
i
should
never
forgive
in
the
spirit
of
your
letter
i
mean
did
you
give
this
beatrice
french
any
ground
for
thinking
that
i
made
a
speculation
of
you
i
said
nothing
of
that
nor
to
any
one
else
to
no
yet
you
told
this
woman
where
i
was
living
and
that
i
had
been
abroad
for
a
long
time
why
yes
i
told
her
so
much
about
you
nancy
replied
not
when
she
first
came
to
me
but
afterwards
only
the
other
day
i
wanted
employment
and
didn
t
know
how
to
get
it
except
through
her
she
promised
me
a
place
if
i
would
disclose
your
name
not
that
she
knew
or
cared
anything
about
but
because
she
still
had
suspicions
about
crewe
i
was
desperate
and
i
told
desperate
why
how
can
i
make
you
understand
what
i
have
gone
through
what
do
you
care
and
what
do
care
whether
you
understand
or
not
it
wasn
t
for
money
and
beatrice
french
knew
it
wasn
then
it
must
have
been
that
you
could
not
bear
the
monotony
of
your
her
answer
was
a
short
careless
laugh
where
is
this
shop
what
do
you
do
it
s
a
association
i
advise
fools
about
the
fashions
and
exhibit
myself
as
a
walking
i
can
t
see
how
it
should
interest
whatever
concerns
you
nancy
interests
me
more
than
anything
else
in
the
again
she
laughed
what
more
do
you
want
to
know
she
was
half
turned
from
him
leaning
at
the
mantelpiece
a
foot
on
the
fender
you
said
just
now
that
you
have
gone
through
worse
things
than
the
shame
of
being
thought
unmarried
tell
me
about
it
not
i
indeed
when
i
was
willing
to
tell
you
everything
you
didn
t
care
to
hear
it
it
s
too
late
it
s
not
too
late
happily
to
drag
you
out
of
this
wretched
slough
into
which
you
are
sinking
whatever
the
cost
shall
be
done
thank
you
i
am
not
disposed
to
let
any
one
drag
me
anywhere
i
want
no
help
and
if
i
did
you
would
be
the
last
person
i
should
accept
it
from
i
don
t
know
why
you
came
here
after
the
agreement
we
made
the
other
tarrant
stepped
towards
her
i
came
to
find
out
whether
you
were
telling
lies
about
me
and
i
should
never
have
thought
it
possible
but
for
my
bad
conscience
i
know
you
had
every
excuse
for
being
embittered
and
for
acting
revengefully
it
seems
you
have
only
told
lies
about
yourself
as
after
all
you
are
my
wife
i
shan
t
allow
once
more
she
turned
upon
him
passionately
i
am
your
wife
you
married
me
against
your
will
and
shook
me
off
as
soon
as
possible
i
won
t
be
bound
to
you
i
shall
act
as
a
free
bound
to
me
you
are
and
shall
be
as
i
to
you
may
say
it
fifty
times
and
it
will
mean
how
bound
to
you
bound
to
share
my
money
i
forgive
you
that
because
i
have
treated
you
you
don
t
mean
it
either
you
know
i
am
incapable
of
such
a
thought
but
that
shall
very
soon
be
put
right
your
marriage
shall
be
made
known
at
known
to
whom
to
the
people
concerned
to
your
don
t
trouble
yourself
she
answered
with
a
smile
they
know
it
tarrant
half
closed
his
eyes
as
he
looked
at
her
what
s
the
use
of
such
a
silly
falsehood
i
told
you
i
had
gone
through
a
good
deal
more
than
you
imagined
i
have
struggled
to
keep
my
money
in
spite
of
shames
and
miseries
and
i
will
have
it
for
myself
and
my
child
if
you
want
to
know
the
truth
go
to
samuel
barmby
and
ask
him
what
he
has
had
to
do
with
me
i
owe
no
explanation
to
tarrant
could
see
her
face
only
in
profile
marvelling
at
the
complications
she
gradually
revealed
he
felt
his
blood
grow
warm
with
desire
of
her
beauty
she
was
his
wife
yet
guarded
as
by
maidenhood
a
familiar
touch
would
bring
the
colour
to
her
cheeks
the
light
of
resentment
to
her
eyes
passion
made
him
glad
of
the
estrangement
which
compelled
a
new
wooing
and
promised
on
her
part
a
new
surrender
you
don
t
owe
it
me
nancy
but
if
i
beg
you
to
tell
me
all
because
i
have
come
to
my
senses
again
because
i
know
how
foolish
and
cruel
i
have
been
remember
what
we
agreed
go
your
way
and
let
me
go
i
had
no
idea
of
what
i
was
agreeing
to
i
took
it
for
granted
that
your
marriage
was
strictly
a
secret
and
that
you
might
be
free
in
the
real
sense
if
you
yes
and
you
were
quite
willing
because
it
gave
you
your
freedom
as
well
i
am
as
free
as
i
wish
to
be
i
have
made
a
life
for
myself
that
satisfies
me
and
now
you
come
to
undo
everything
i
won
t
be
tormented
i
have
endured
then
only
one
course
is
open
to
me
i
shall
publish
your
marriage
everywhere
i
shall
make
a
home
for
you
and
have
the
child
brought
to
it
then
come
or
not
as
you
at
mention
of
the
child
nancy
regarded
him
with
cold
curiosity
how
are
you
to
make
a
home
for
me
i
thought
you
had
difficulty
enough
in
supporting
that
is
no
concern
of
yours
it
shall
be
done
and
in
a
day
or
two
then
make
your
you
think
i
can
be
forced
to
live
with
a
man
i
don
t
love
i
shouldn
t
dream
of
living
with
a
woman
who
didn
t
love
me
but
you
are
married
and
a
mother
and
the
secrecy
that
is
degrading
you
shall
come
to
an
end
acknowledge
me
or
not
i
shall
acknowledge
and
make
it
known
that
i
am
to
blame
for
all
that
has
and
what
good
will
you
do
i
shall
do
good
to
myself
at
all
events
i
m
a
selfish
fellow
and
shall
be
so
to
the
end
no
nancy
glanced
at
him
to
interpret
the
speech
by
his
expression
he
was
smiling
what
good
will
it
do
you
to
have
to
support
me
the
selfishness
i
see
in
it
is
your
wishing
to
take
me
from
a
comfortable
home
and
make
me
that
can
t
be
helped
and
what
s
more
you
won
t
think
it
a
how
do
you
know
that
i
have
borne
dreadful
degradations
rather
than
lose
my
that
was
for
the
child
s
sake
not
for
your
he
said
it
softly
and
kindly
and
for
the
first
time
nancy
met
his
eyes
without
defiance
it
was
i
could
always
have
earned
my
own
living
tarrant
paused
a
moment
then
spoke
with
look
averted
is
he
well
and
properly
cared
for
if
he
were
not
well
and
safe
i
shouldn
t
be
away
from
when
will
you
let
me
see
him
nancy
she
did
not
smile
but
there
was
a
brightening
of
her
countenance
which
she
concealed
tarrant
stepped
to
her
side
dear
my
own
love
will
you
try
to
forgive
me
it
was
all
my
cursed
laziness
it
would
never
have
happened
if
i
hadn
t
fallen
into
poverty
poverty
is
the
devil
and
it
overcame
how
can
you
think
that
shall
be
strong
enough
to
face
it
she
asked
moving
half
a
step
away
leave
me
to
myself
i
am
contented
i
have
made
up
my
mind
about
what
is
before
me
and
i
won
t
go
through
all
that
tired
of
standing
she
dropped
upon
the
nearest
chair
and
lay
back
you
can
t
be
contented
nancy
in
a
position
that
dishonours
you
from
what
you
tell
me
it
seems
that
your
secret
is
no
secret
at
all
will
you
compel
me
to
go
to
that
man
barmby
and
seek
information
from
him
about
my
own
wife
i
have
had
to
do
worse
things
than
don
t
torture
me
by
such
vague
hints
i
entreat
you
to
tell
me
at
once
the
worst
that
you
have
suffered
how
did
barmby
get
to
know
of
your
marriage
and
why
has
he
kept
silent
about
it
there
can
t
be
anything
that
you
are
ashamed
to
no
the
shame
is
all
i
take
it
upon
myself
all
of
it
i
ought
never
to
have
left
you
but
that
baseness
followed
only
too
naturally
on
the
cowardice
which
kept
me
from
declaring
our
marriage
when
honour
demanded
it
i
have
played
a
contemptible
part
in
this
story
don
t
refuse
to
help
me
now
that
i
am
ready
to
behave
more
like
a
man
put
your
hand
in
mine
and
let
us
be
friends
if
we
mayn
t
be
she
sat
irresponsive
you
were
a
brave
girl
you
consented
to
my
going
away
because
it
seemed
best
and
i
took
advantage
of
your
sincerity
often
enough
that
last
look
of
yours
has
reproached
me
i
wonder
how
i
had
the
heart
to
leave
you
nancy
raised
herself
and
said
coldly
it
was
what
i
might
have
expected
i
had
only
my
own
folly
to
thank
you
behaved
as
most
men
this
was
a
harder
reproach
than
any
yet
tarrant
winced
under
it
he
would
much
rather
have
been
accused
of
abnormal
villainy
and
i
was
foolish
continued
nancy
in
more
ways
than
you
knew
you
feared
i
had
told
jessica
morgan
of
our
marriage
and
you
were
right
of
course
i
denied
it
she
has
been
the
cause
of
my
worst
in
rapid
sentences
she
told
the
story
of
her
successive
humiliations
recounted
her
sufferings
at
the
hands
of
jessica
and
beatrice
and
samuel
barmby
when
she
ceased
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
has
barmby
been
here
again
tarrant
asked
sternly
yes
he
has
been
twice
and
talked
in
just
the
same
way
and
i
had
to
sit
still
before
him
has
he
said
one
word
that
no
no
she
interrupted
hastily
he
s
only
a
fool
not
man
enough
to
that
saves
me
trouble
said
tarrant
i
have
only
to
treat
him
like
a
fool
my
poor
darling
what
vile
torments
you
have
endured
and
you
pretend
that
you
would
rather
live
on
this
fellow
s
interested
generosity
for
of
course
he
hopes
to
be
rewarded
than
throw
the
whole
squalid
entanglement
behind
you
and
be
a
free
honest
woman
even
if
a
poor
one
i
see
no
you
have
lost
all
your
love
for
me
well
i
can
t
complain
of
that
but
bear
my
name
you
shall
and
be
supported
by
me
i
tell
you
that
it
was
never
for
me
actually
to
desert
you
and
the
little
one
never
possible
i
shirked
a
duty
as
long
as
i
could
that
s
all
it
comes
to
i
loafed
and
paltered
until
the
want
of
a
dinner
drove
me
into
honesty
try
to
forget
it
dear
nancy
try
to
forgive
me
my
dearest
she
was
again
and
his
appeal
seemed
to
have
no
power
over
her
emotions
you
are
forgetting
she
said
practically
that
i
have
lived
on
money
to
which
i
had
no
right
and
that
i
or
you
can
be
forced
to
repay
repaid
it
must
be
whether
demanded
or
not
where
does
barmby
live
perhaps
i
could
see
him
what
means
have
you
of
keeping
us
all
alive
some
of
my
work
has
been
accepted
here
and
there
but
there
s
something
else
i
have
in
mind
i
don
t
ask
you
to
become
a
wife
in
the
ordinary
way
i
can
t
afford
to
take
a
house
i
must
put
you
with
the
child
into
as
good
lodgings
as
i
can
hope
to
pay
for
and
work
on
by
myself
just
seeing
you
as
often
as
you
will
let
me
even
if
you
were
willing
it
would
be
a
mistake
for
us
to
live
together
for
one
thing
i
couldn
t
work
under
such
conditions
for
another
it
would
make
you
a
slave
tell
me
are
you
willing
to
undertake
the
care
of
the
child
if
nothing
else
is
asked
of
you
nancy
gave
him
a
disdainful
smile
a
smile
like
those
of
her
girlhood
i
m
not
quite
so
feeble
a
creature
as
you
think
you
would
rather
have
the
child
to
yourself
than
be
living
away
from
him
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
why
trouble
to
ask
such
questions
because
i
have
no
wish
to
force
burdens
upon
you
you
said
just
now
that
you
could
see
little
prospect
of
freedom
in
such
a
life
as
i
have
to
offer
you
i
thought
you
perhaps
meant
that
the
care
of
the
child
would
i
meant
nothing
nancy
broke
in
with
fretful
impatience
where
is
he
our
boy
at
dulwich
i
told
you
that
in
my
last
yes
yes
i
thought
you
might
have
i
couldn
t
have
found
a
better
kinder
woman
can
you
guess
how
many
answers
i
had
to
the
advertisement
of
course
of
them
took
it
for
granted
you
would
pay
so
much
a
week
and
ask
no
questions
they
would
just
not
have
starved
the
baby
unless
you
had
hinted
to
them
that
you
were
willing
to
pay
a
lump
sum
for
a
in
which
case
the
affair
would
have
been
more
or
less
skilfully
mary
knew
all
about
that
she
came
from
falmouth
and
spent
two
days
in
visiting
people
i
knew
i
could
rely
on
her
judgment
there
were
only
four
or
five
people
she
cared
to
see
at
all
and
of
these
only
one
that
seemed
to
be
sure
one
out
of
a
higher
percentage
than
would
apply
to
mankind
at
large
i
dare
say
i
was
afraid
you
might
have
found
a
difficulty
in
registering
the
no
i
went
to
the
office
myself
the
morning
that
i
was
leaving
falmouth
and
the
registrar
evidently
knew
nothing
about
me
it
isn
t
such
a
small
place
that
everybody
living
there
is
noticed
and
talked
and
mary
took
the
child
straight
to
dulwich
two
days
before
i
came
so
as
to
have
the
house
ready
for
me
perhaps
it
was
unfortunate
nancy
that
you
had
so
good
a
friend
but
for
that
i
should
have
suffered
more
uneasiness
about
she
answered
with
energy
there
is
no
husband
in
the
world
worth
such
a
friend
as
at
this
tarrant
first
smiled
then
laughed
nancy
kept
her
lips
rigid
it
happened
that
he
again
saw
her
face
in
exact
profile
and
again
it
warmed
the
current
of
his
blood
some
day
you
shall
think
better
of
she
paid
no
attention
watching
her
he
asked
what
are
you
thinking
of
so
earnestly
her
answer
was
delayed
a
little
but
she
said
at
length
with
an
absent
manner
horace
might
lend
me
the
money
to
pay
back
what
i
your
brother
if
he
can
afford
it
there
would
be
less
objection
to
that
than
to
any
other
plan
i
can
think
of
but
i
must
ask
it
myself
you
shall
beg
no
more
favours
i
will
ask
it
in
your
you
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
nancy
replied
drily
if
you
think
to
please
me
by
humiliating
yourself
you
are
very
much
mistaken
and
you
mustn
t
imagine
that
i
put
myself
into
your
hands
to
be
looked
after
as
though
i
had
no
will
of
my
own
with
the
past
you
have
nothing
to
do
with
past
at
all
events
care
for
the
future
as
you
but
i
must
see
your
no
i
won
t
have
she
stood
up
to
emphasise
her
words
i
must
it
s
the
only
way
in
which
i
can
satisfy
myself
then
i
refuse
to
take
a
step
said
nancy
leave
all
that
to
me
and
i
will
go
to
live
where
you
please
and
never
grumble
however
poor
i
am
interfere
and
i
will
go
on
living
as
now
on
samuel
barmby
s
there
was
no
mistaking
her
resolution
tarrant
hesitated
and
bit
his
lip
how
long
then
before
you
act
he
inquired
abruptly
when
my
new
home
is
found
i
am
ready
to
go
you
will
deal
honestly
with
me
you
will
tell
every
one
and
give
up
everything
not
strictly
yours
i
have
done
with
lies
said
nancy
thank
heaven
so
have
i
part
vi
a
virtue
of
necessity
chapter
upon
the
final
tempest
in
de
crespigny
park
there
followed
for
arthur
peachey
a
calmer
and
happier
season
than
he
had
ever
known
to
have
acted
with
stern
resolve
is
always
a
satisfaction
especially
to
the
man
conscious
of
weak
and
condemned
for
the
most
part
to
yield
in
his
cheap
lodging
at
clapham
peachey
awoke
each
morning
with
a
vague
sense
of
joy
which
became
delight
as
soon
as
he
had
collected
his
senses
he
was
a
free
man
no
snarl
greeted
him
as
he
turned
his
head
upon
the
pillow
he
could
lie
and
meditate
could
rise
quietly
when
the
moment
sounded
could
go
downstairs
to
a
leisurely
meal
cheered
perhaps
by
a
letter
reporting
that
all
was
well
with
his
dear
little
son
simple
elementary
pleasures
but
how
he
savoured
them
after
his
years
of
sordid
bondage
it
was
the
blessedness
of
divorce
without
squalid
publicity
it
was
the
vast
relief
of
widowerhood
without
dreary
memories
of
death
and
burial
in
releasing
himself
from
such
companionship
the
man
felt
as
though
he
had
washed
and
become
clean
innocent
of
scientific
speculation
he
had
the
misfortune
about
this
time
to
read
in
paper
or
magazine
something
on
the
subject
of
heredity
the
idle
verbiage
of
some
scribbler
it
set
him
anxiously
thinking
whether
his
son
would
develop
the
vices
of
the
mother
s
mind
and
from
that
day
he
read
all
the
printed
chatter
regarding
natural
inheritance
that
he
could
lay
his
hands
on
the
benefit
he
derived
from
this
course
of
study
was
neither
more
nor
less
than
might
have
been
expected
it
supplied
him
with
a
new
trouble
which
sometimes
kept
him
wakeful
he
could
only
resolve
that
his
boy
should
have
the
best
education
procurable
for
money
if
he
starved
himself
in
providing
it
he
had
begun
to
live
with
the
utmost
economy
and
for
a
twofold
reason
the
business
of
messrs
ducker
blunt
threatened
a
decline
and
this
apart
he
desired
to
get
out
of
it
to
obtain
an
interest
in
some
more
honourable
concern
for
a
long
time
it
had
been
known
to
him
that
the
disinfectants
manufactured
by
his
firm
were
far
from
trustworthy
and
of
late
the
complaints
of
purchasers
had
become
frequent
with
the
manufacturing
department
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
tried
to
think
himself
free
from
responsibility
for
in
spite
of
amiable
qualities
he
was
a
man
of
business
and
saw
a
great
part
of
life
through
the
commercial
spectacles
commonly
worn
nevertheless
conscience
unsettled
him
one
day
he
heard
his
partners
joking
over
the
legislative
omission
by
virtue
of
which
they
were
able
to
adulterate
their
disinfectants
to
any
extent
without
fear
of
penalty
their
laughter
grated
upon
him
and
he
got
out
of
the
way
if
he
could
lay
aside
a
few
thousands
of
pounds
assuredly
his
connection
with
the
affair
should
be
terminated
so
he
lived
for
his
own
part
on
a
pound
a
week
and
informed
ada
through
his
solicitor
that
she
must
be
satisfied
with
a
certain
very
moderate
allowance
peachey
naturally
laid
herself
out
to
give
every
one
as
much
trouble
as
possible
insulting
showered
upon
her
husband
at
his
place
of
business
after
a
few
weeks
she
discovered
his
lodging
and
addressed
the
thither
but
she
made
no
attempt
at
personal
molestation
the
loss
of
her
child
gave
her
not
the
slightest
concern
yet
she
determined
to
find
out
where
the
boy
was
living
she
remembered
that
peachey
had
relatives
at
canterbury
and
after
a
troublesome
search
succeeded
in
her
purpose
an
interview
with
her
husband
s
married
sister
proved
so
unsatisfactory
to
ada
that
she
had
recourse
to
her
familiar
weapons
rage
insult
and
menace
with
the
result
that
she
was
forcibly
removed
and
made
a
scandal
in
the
quiet
street
then
she
consulted
men
of
law
and
found
one
who
encouraged
her
to
sue
for
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
it
came
to
nothing
however
for
in
the
meantime
she
was
growing
tired
of
her
solitary
existence
friends
of
course
she
had
none
and
the
spirit
moved
her
to
try
a
change
of
tactics
she
wrote
a
long
long
letter
penitent
i
have
behaved
outrageously
to
you
dearest
arthur
i
must
have
been
mad
to
say
and
do
such
things
the
doctor
tells
me
that
my
health
has
been
in
a
very
bad
state
for
a
long
time
and
i
really
don
t
remember
half
that
has
happened
you
were
quite
right
when
you
told
me
that
i
should
be
better
if
i
didn
t
live
such
an
idle
life
and
i
have
quite
quite
made
up
my
mind
to
be
an
industrious
and
a
woman
all
yesterday
i
spent
in
needlework
and
crying
oh
the
tears
that
i
have
shed
my
darling
husband
what
can
i
do
to
win
your
forgiveness
do
consider
how
lonely
i
am
in
this
house
beatrice
has
been
horrid
to
me
if
i
said
all
i
think
about
she
wouldn
t
like
to
hear
it
but
i
am
learning
to
control
my
tongue
she
lives
alone
in
a
flat
and
has
men
to
spend
every
evening
with
her
it
s
disgraceful
and
there
s
fanny
who
i
am
sure
is
leading
an
immoral
life
abroad
of
course
i
shall
never
speak
to
her
again
you
were
quite
right
when
you
said
my
sisters
were
peachey
had
never
permitted
himself
any
such
i
will
have
no
one
but
you
my
dear
good
sweet
so
on
over
several
pages
reading
it
the
husband
stood
aghast
at
this
new
revelation
of
female
possibilities
at
the
end
he
hurriedly
threw
it
into
the
fire
fearing
and
with
good
reason
that
weakness
in
his
own
character
to
which
the
woman
addressed
herself
every
day
for
a
week
there
arrived
a
replica
of
this
epistle
and
at
length
he
answered
it
was
the
fatal
concession
though
he
wrote
with
almost
savage
severity
ada
replied
in
terms
of
exuberant
gratitude
oh
how
delighted
she
was
to
see
his
dear
handwriting
once
more
how
it
reminded
her
of
happy
days
when
they
loved
each
other
so
tenderly
then
came
two
strophes
of
a
sentimental
song
and
lastly
an
impassioned
appeal
to
be
allowed
to
see
her
husband
were
it
only
for
five
minutes
another
week
of
such
besieging
and
the
poor
fellow
s
foolish
heart
gave
way
he
would
see
the
wretched
woman
and
tell
her
that
though
never
could
he
consent
to
live
with
her
again
he
had
no
malicious
feeling
and
was
willing
to
be
her
friend
at
a
distance
so
at
six
o
clock
one
evening
behold
him
tremulously
approaching
the
house
in
de
crespigny
park
tremulously
because
he
dreaded
the
assault
upon
his
emotions
to
which
he
so
recklessly
exposed
himself
he
was
admitted
by
a
very
young
servant
in
a
very
clean
cap
and
apron
silence
possessed
the
dwelling
he
did
not
venture
to
tread
with
natural
step
he
entered
the
and
there
from
amid
a
heap
of
household
linen
which
required
the
needle
rose
the
penitent
wife
ostentatiously
she
drew
from
her
finger
a
thimble
then
advanced
with
head
bent
how
kind
of
you
arthur
how
how
very
and
she
was
dissolved
in
tears
so
genuine
that
they
marked
pale
rillets
across
the
bloom
of
her
cheeks
about
a
month
after
that
the
furniture
was
removed
from
de
crespigny
park
to
a
much
smaller
house
at
brixton
where
and
peachey
took
up
their
abode
together
a
medical
man
shortly
called
and
ada
not
without
secret
disgust
smilingly
made
known
to
her
husband
that
she
must
now
be
very
careful
of
her
health
on
one
point
only
the
man
had
held
to
a
rational
resolve
he
would
not
allow
his
little
son
to
be
brought
back
to
london
away
from
the
home
where
he
was
happy
and
thriving
out
of
mere
ada
strove
for
a
long
time
to
overcome
this
decision
finding
argument
and
artifice
of
no
avail
she
dropped
the
matter
peachey
owed
this
triumph
largely
to
the
firm
commonsense
of
his
sister
who
plainly
refused
to
let
the
little
fellow
quit
her
care
for
that
of
such
a
woman
as
he
was
unfortunate
enough
to
call
mother
christmas
came
and
with
it
an
unanticipated
call
from
miss
fanny
french
who
said
she
had
lately
recovered
from
a
serious
illness
in
paris
the
nature
of
her
malady
she
did
not
specify
it
had
left
her
haggard
and
thin
but
by
no
means
deficient
in
vivacity
she
was
dressed
with
tawdry
extravagance
wore
a
mass
of
false
yellow
hair
had
her
eyebrows
dyed
black
piquant
contrast
and
her
cheeks
and
lips
richly
carmined
no
veritable
information
as
to
her
past
and
present
could
be
gleaned
from
the
mixture
of
french
and
english
which
she
ceaselessly
gabbled
she
had
come
over
for
christmas
that
was
all
could
not
dream
of
returning
to
live
in
wretched
england
at
brussels
and
in
paris
she
had
made
hosts
of
friends
just
the
right
sort
of
people
ada
told
her
all
the
news
of
most
interest
was
that
which
related
to
nancy
lord
only
a
month
ago
it
had
become
known
that
nancy
was
married
and
the
mother
of
a
child
the
barmbys
found
it
out
somehow
ada
narrated
she
was
married
to
a
man
called
tarrant
some
one
we
never
heard
of
on
the
very
day
of
her
father
s
death
and
of
course
before
she
knew
anything
about
his
will
then
of
course
it
had
to
be
kept
dark
or
she
d
lose
all
her
money
her
husband
hadn
t
a
farthing
she
supported
him
and
they
say
he
lived
most
of
the
time
in
her
house
he
s
a
regular
scamp
a
drinking
betting
fellow
well
it
all
came
out
and
the
barmbys
turned
her
into
the
street
at
a
moment
s
notice
serve
her
right
fanny
shrieked
with
merriment
and
what
is
she
doing
she
went
on
her
knees
to
beatrice
and
begged
for
a
place
at
the
shop
if
it
was
only
a
few
shillings
a
week
nice
for
nancy
lord
wasn
t
it
of
course
beatrice
sent
her
off
with
a
flea
in
her
ear
i
don
t
know
where
she
s
living
but
i
ve
heard
that
her
husband
has
gone
to
america
and
left
her
to
shift
for
herself
now
there
s
nothing
more
to
be
got
out
of
for
supplementary
details
of
this
racy
narrative
fanny
sought
out
beatrice
but
to
her
astonishment
and
annoyance
beatrice
would
tell
nothing
the
elder
sister
urged
fanny
to
give
an
account
of
herself
and
used
some
very
plain
speech
of
the
admonitory
kind
what
has
become
of
that
jackanapes
horace
lord
asked
fanny
after
a
contemptuous
remark
about
i
don
t
know
the
question
is
what
s
going
to
become
of
whereupon
the
girl
grew
vituperative
in
two
languages
and
made
off
her
relatives
saw
no
more
of
her
for
a
long
time
to
peachey
was
born
a
daughter
naturally
the
months
preceding
this
event
had
been
for
her
husband
a
renewal
of
martyrdom
his
one
supporting
solace
lay
in
the
thought
of
the
little
lad
at
canterbury
all
the
old
troubles
were
revived
from
morning
to
night
the
house
rang
with
brawls
between
mistress
and
servants
in
the
paroxysms
favoured
by
her
physical
condition
ada
behaved
like
a
candidate
for
bedlam
and
more
than
once
obliged
her
husband
to
seek
temporary
peace
in
lodgings
he
left
home
at
eight
o
clock
every
morning
and
returned
as
late
as
possible
the
necessity
of
passing
long
evenings
made
him
haunt
places
of
entertainment
and
he
sometimes
had
recourse
to
drink
he
by
nature
the
soberest
of
men
in
fear
of
what
awaited
him
on
his
tardy
appearance
at
brixton
a
month
after
ada
s
confinement
he
once
more
acted
a
sane
part
and
announced
by
letter
that
he
would
die
rather
than
continue
living
with
his
wife
as
it
was
fine
autumn
weather
he
went
down
to
a
seaside
place
where
his
canterbury
relatives
and
the
little
boy
joined
him
for
a
holiday
of
several
weeks
again
ada
was
to
receive
an
allowance
she
despatched
a
few
very
virulent
but
presently
grew
quiet
and
appeared
to
accept
the
situation
in
early
winter
fanny
french
came
over
to
england
she
had
again
been
ill
and
this
time
with
results
obviously
graver
her
first
call
was
upon
beatrice
who
still
occupied
the
flat
at
brixton
and
here
she
unbosomed
herself
of
a
dolorous
story
all
her
money
had
vanished
stolen
most
of
it
fanny
declared
she
was
without
resources
and
as
any
one
could
see
in
a
wretched
state
of
health
would
beatrice
have
compassion
on
her
would
she
lend
her
money
till
she
was
well
enough
to
look
round
miss
french
at
once
took
the
girl
into
her
own
home
and
had
her
looked
after
fanny
coughed
in
an
alarming
way
the
doctor
speaking
privately
with
beatrice
made
an
unpleasant
report
was
it
possible
to
send
the
patient
to
a
mild
climate
for
the
winter
months
yes
miss
french
could
manage
that
and
would
a
suitable
attendant
having
been
procured
fanny
was
despatched
to
bournemouth
whence
in
a
day
or
two
she
wrote
to
her
sister
thus
you
ve
been
awfully
kind
to
me
and
i
shan
t
forget
it
when
i
m
well
again
feel
a
good
deal
fitter
already
dullish
place
this
but
i
ve
got
to
put
up
with
it
i
ve
had
a
letter
from
ada
if
you
see
her
tell
her
she
s
a
beast
and
i
wish
arthur
would
wring
her
scraggy
neck
she
says
it
s
all
my
own
fault
wait
till
i
m
back
again
and
i
ll
pay
her
a
call
my
own
fault
indeed
it
seems
to
me
i
m
very
much
to
be
walking
one
day
along
the
by
herself
fanny
observed
a
young
man
s
figure
a
few
paces
in
advance
of
her
which
seemed
to
awaken
recollections
presently
the
young
man
turned
and
showed
beyond
doubt
the
countenance
of
horace
lord
he
met
her
eyes
gave
a
doubtful
troubled
look
and
was
going
past
when
fanny
accosted
him
well
don
t
you
know
me
why
it
it
really
how
glad
i
am
to
see
you
but
what
on
earth
are
you
doing
here
amusing
myself
vous
and
you
oh
doing
the
they
had
shaken
hands
and
were
sauntering
on
together
anything
wrong
with
your
health
fanny
asked
scrutinising
the
pale
thin
face
with
its
touch
of
warmth
on
the
cheeks
oh
i
ve
had
a
bit
of
a
cold
nothing
to
speak
of
you
been
out
of
sorts
a
little
run
down
they
horace
looked
his
surprise
why

didn
t
know

went
in
for
that
kind
of
didn
t
you
i
ve
been
studying
abroad
for
a
long
time
thinking
of
taking
a
place
as
french
teacher
in
some
high
i
am
very
glad
to
hear
it
capital
idea
sure
i
hope
you
ll
be
thanks
awf
ly
tell
me
something
about
yourself
why
it
s
two
years
since
we
saw
each
other
isn
t
it
are
you
married
yet
horace
smiled
and
coloured
no
no
not
yet
i
m
in
business
with
luckworth
crewe
sort
of
sleeping
partner
just
are
you
really
and
how
s
your
sister
the
young
man
bent
his
brows
uncomfortably
don
t
you
know
anything
about
her
he
asked
i
ve
heard
she
s
yes
a
man
called
tarrant
very
clever
fellow
he
writes
for
the
i
say
miss
french
i
generally
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
a
biscuit
at
the
confectioner
s
about
this
time
will
you
give
me
the
pleasure
of
your
company
i
generally
go
in
for
the
same
kind
of
so
they
repaired
to
the
and
sat
talking
for
of
trifles
which
made
them
laugh
and
you
really
didn
t
know
me
said
fanny
when
her
glass
of
wine
was
finished
have
i
changed
so
much
a
good
deal
not
for
the
worse
oh
dear
no
the
girl
giggled
well
i
don
t
mind
saying
that
have
changed
a
good
deal
for
the
horace
flushed
at
the
compliment
i
m
much
older
he
answered
with
a
sigh
as
though
the
years
of
a
sexagenarian
weighed
upon
him
that
s
just
what
i
like
in
you
you
re
so
much
more
of
a
man
don
t
be
they
went
forth
again
into
the
sunshine
at
the
door
both
coughed
and
both
pretended
that
it
wasn
t
a
cough
at
all
but
a
voluntary
little
hem
chapter
damerel
was
younger
than
ever
she
had
spent
october
abroad
with
her
friends
and
miss
chittle
and
the
greater
part
of
november
at
brighton
with
other
friends
back
in
town
she
established
herself
at
one
of
the
various
honoured
by
her
patronage
and
prepared
to
enjoy
the
social
life
of
winter
half
a
year
ago
an
unwonted
depression
had
troubled
her
serene
existence
at
the
close
of
the
london
season
she
seemed
weary
and
spiritless
very
unlike
herself
having
no
invitation
for
the
next
two
months
she
withdrew
to
whitsand
and
there
spent
some
cheerless
weeks
whitsand
was
the
as
yet
unfashionable
seaside
place
which
had
attracted
the
speculative
eye
of
luckworth
crewe
for
the
past
two
years
he
had
been
trying
to
inspire
certain
men
of
capital
with
his
own
faith
in
the
possibilities
of
whitsand
he
owned
a
share
in
the
new
hotel
just
opened
whenever
his
manifold
affairs
allowed
him
a
day
s
holiday
he
spent
it
at
whitsand
pacing
the
small
esplanade
and
meditating
improvements
that
these
improvements
signified
the
conversion
of
a
pretty
little
spot
into
a
hideous
brand
new
resort
of
noisy
hordes
in
no
degree
troubled
crewe
s
conscience
for
his
own
part
he
could
appreciate
the
charms
of
whitsand
as
it
stood
he
was
by
no
means
insensible
to
natural
beauty
and
the
ancient
peace
which
so
contrasted
with
his
life
of
every
day
but
first
and
foremost
in
his
mind
came
the
necessity
of
making
money
and
to
fill
his
pockets
he
would
no
more
hesitate
about
destroying
the
loveliest
spot
on
earth
than
the
starving
hunter
would
stay
his
hand
out
of
admiration
for
bird
or
beast
it
was
with
much
delight
that
he
heard
of
damerel
s
retreat
to
whitsand
to
the
note
in
which
she
acquainted
him
with
her
arrival
there
he
replied
effusively
the
patronage
of
a
few
really
fashionable
people
such
as
yourself
would
soon
do
wonders
we
must
have
a
special
paragraph
in
the
local
paper
drawing
attention
to
your
being
there
and
so
on
an
answer
by
return
of
post
rather
disappointed
him
on
no
account
wrote
damerel
must
her
name
be
specially
mentioned
in
the
paper
she
had
taken
very
simple
lodgings
very
inexpensive
and
wished
to
live
as
quietly
as
possible
but
after
seeing
the
place
she
quite
agreed
with
mr
crewe
that
it
had
a
future
and
if
he
could
run
down
some
day
whilst
she
was
here
it
would
give
her
great
pleasure
to
hear
his
projects
explained
on
the
spot
crewe
ran
down
in
speaking
of
damerel
as
a
really
fashionable
person
he
used
no
insincerity
from
their
first
meeting
he
had
seen
in
this
lady
his
ideal
of
social
distinction
she
was
in
fact
the
only
woman
of
skilfully
pretentious
demeanour
with
whom
he
had
ever
spoken
her
distant
likeness
to
nancy
lord
interested
and
attracted
him
her
suave
superiority
awed
his
conscious
roughness
she
seemed
to
him
exquisitely
gracious
wonderfully
sweet
and
as
little
by
little
he
attained
the
right
to
think
of
her
almost
as
a
friend
his
humble
admiration
became
blended
with
feelings
he
took
particular
care
not
to
betray
lest
he
should
expose
himself
to
ridicule
that
her
age
exceeded
his
own
by
some
years
he
was
of
course
aware
but
this
fact
soon
dropped
out
of
his
mind
and
never
returned
to
it
not
only
did
he
think
damerel
a
type
of
aristocratic
beauty
he
saw
in
her
countenance
all
the
freshness
and
the
promise
of
youth
the
slight
mystery
attaching
to
her
position
only
increased
his
susceptibility
to
her
charms
it
seemed
to
him
very
probable
that
she
had
but
a
moderate
income
perhaps
she
was
not
free
from
anxieties
on
that
score
but
such
a
woman
would
of
course
marry
again
and
marry
well
the
thought
grew
troublesome
and
presently
accounted
for
ebullitions
of
wrath
accompanied
by
more
than
usually
vigorous
language
when
business
matters
went
wrong
at
whitsand
damerel
showed
herself
more
than
ever
sweetly
affable
the
season
she
said
had
been
rather
too
much
for
her
she
must
take
care
of
her
health
besides
and
her
smile
played
upon
crewe
s
pulses
there
were
troubles
cares
of
which
she
could
not
speak
to
so
valued
a
friend
i
m
afraid
you
re
anxious
about
your
nephew
murmured
the
man
of
business
though
at
the
same
time
he
suspected
other
things
for
the
lodgings
in
which
he
found
damerel
were
certainly
modest
yes
i
trouble
a
good
deal
about
him
if
only
dear
horace
would
be
reconciled
to
me
it
seems
such
a
long
long
time
you
know
that
we
have
corresponded
but
he
refuses
to
see
me
it
pains
me
deeply
mr
and
after
a
silence
there
s
a
special
reason
why
i
wish
he
would
be
friends
with
me
a
reason
that
concerns
his
own
future
why
should
i
not
tell
you
i
am
sure
you
will
respect
my
he
will
very
soon
become
independent
and
then
i
do
so
fear
he
may
make
a
foolish
marriage
yet
all
the
time
there
is
a
chance
waiting
for
him
which
would
establish
his
fortune
and
his
happiness
for
life
did
he
ever
speak
to
you
of
miss
chittle
i
don
t
remember
the
such
a
dear
sweet
girl
and
with
really
large
means
he
was
introduced
to
her
during
the
happy
time
when
we
saw
so
much
of
each
other
and
she
at
once
became
interested
in
him
her
dear
mother
assured
me
of
it
she
is
a
very
shy
retiring
girl
and
has
refused
many
offers
before
and
since
then
isn
t
it
a
pity
but
i
am
losing
all
hope
and
i
so
fear
he
may
have
formed
some
other
crewe
went
back
to
london
resolved
that
horace
lord
should
no
longer
play
the
and
he
was
successful
horace
had
all
but
lost
his
resentment
against
damerel
he
kept
aloof
out
of
stubborn
conceit
it
had
not
dignity
enough
to
be
called
pride
the
same
feeling
that
still
estranged
him
from
nancy
though
he
would
gladly
have
welcomed
his
sister
s
offer
of
affection
persuaded
or
commanded
by
luckworth
crewe
he
took
the
train
to
whitsand
and
remained
there
for
several
days
damerel
wrote
her
friend
in
farringdon
street
a
letter
of
gratitude
which
acted
upon
him
like
champagne
in
a
postscript
she
said
mrs
chittle
and
her
daughter
have
consented
to
come
here
for
a
week
or
two
they
will
take
rooms
at
the
before
the
end
of
september
horace
lord
was
engaged
to
winifred
chittle
two
years
had
made
very
little
change
in
miss
chittle
s
appearance
she
was
still
colourless
and
abnormally
shy
still
had
the
look
of
one
who
sheds
secret
tears
and
her
repugnance
to
society
had
if
possible
increased
horace
thought
her
pretty
was
impressed
by
her
extreme
gentleness
and
refinement
but
she
obtained
no
power
over
his
emotions
such
as
that
formerly
exercised
by
fanny
french
it
struck
him
too
as
a
very
strange
thing
that
a
young
lady
with
a
large
fortune
should
be
willing
to
marry
a
man
of
his
social
insignificance
my
dear
said
damerel
it
was
a
case
of
love
at
first
but
horace
who
had
gained
some
experience
of
life
could
not
believe
this
he
wooed
and
won
yet
even
when
winifred
accepted
him
he
felt
that
she
did
it
under
some
constraint
her
pale
face
declared
no
happiness
had
she
chosen
damerel
could
have
explained
the
mystery
she
knew
that
several
years
ago
winifred
s
name
had
been
blighted
by
a
scandal
and
that
the
girl
s
shrinking
from
every
proposal
of
marriage
was
due
in
part
perhaps
to
the
memory
of
love
betrayed
in
part
to
a
sense
of
honour
and
to
the
suspicion
that
men
knowing
her
disgrace
condoned
it
for
the
sake
of
her
wealth
interest
made
damerel
generous
she
admitted
every
excuse
for
winifred
and
persuaded
herself
that
in
procuring
horace
such
a
wife
she
was
doing
him
only
a
nominal
wrong
the
young
people
could
live
apart
from
that
corner
of
society
in
which
miss
chittle
s
name
gave
occasion
to
smiles
or
looks
of
perfunctory
censure
if
winifred
after
marriage
chose
to
make
confession
why
that
was
her
own
affair
and
horace
would
be
wise
enough
all
advantages
considered
to
take
the
matter
philosophically
that
was
the
view
of
a
observer
to
read
winifred
perfectly
there
needed
a
much
more
subtle
and
sympathetic
intelligence
the
girl
had
in
truth
conceived
a
liking
for
horace
lord
and
it
grew
stronger
when
she
learnt
that
neither
by
birth
nor
present
circumstances
did
he
belong
to
her
own
world
to
please
her
mother
she
was
willing
to
take
a
husband
but
the
husband
must
be
of
her
own
choice
she
wished
to
enter
upon
a
wholly
new
life
remote
from
the
social
conditions
which
of
late
years
had
crushed
her
spirit
from
the
men
who
had
hitherto
approached
her
she
shrank
in
fear
horace
lord
and
not
uneducated
yet
so
far
from
formidable
suggested
a
new
hope
even
though
he
might
be
actuated
by
the
ordinary
motives
she
discerned
in
him
a
softness
a
pliability
of
nature
which
would
harmonise
with
her
own
timid
disposition
to
the
thought
of
deceiving
him
on
the
subject
of
her
past
she
was
reconciled
by
a
resolve
to
make
his
happiness
the
sole
object
of
her
existence
in
the
future
horace
was
amiability
itself
and
seemed
if
not
to
love
her
ardently
which
perhaps
she
did
not
even
desire
at
least
to
regard
her
with
an
increasing
affection
nothing
was
said
about
the
condition
of
the
prospective
bridegroom
s
health
though
horace
had
confided
to
damerel
that
he
suffered
from
a
troublesome
cough
accompanied
now
and
then
by
an
alarming
symptom
in
her
boundless
exultation
at
the
end
achieved
damerel
made
light
of
this
complaint
horace
was
not
free
to
marry
until
nearly
the
end
of
the
year
for
though
money
would
henceforth
be
no
matter
of
anxiety
he
might
as
well
secure
the
small
inheritance
presently
due
to
him
november
and
december
he
should
spend
at
bournemouth
under
the
best
medical
care
and
after
that
if
needful
his
wife
would
go
with
him
to
madeira
or
some
such
place
no
wonder
damerel
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
great
fact
that
horace
had
secured
a
fortune
her
own
resources
were
coming
to
an
end
and
but
for
the
certainty
that
horace
would
not
grudge
her
an
ample
provision
she
must
at
this
moment
have
been
racking
her
brains
even
as
through
the
summer
for
help
against
the
evil
that
drew
near
constitutional
lightness
of
heart
had
enabled
her
to
enjoy
life
on
a
steadily
and
rapidly
diminishing
fund
there
had
been
hope
in
nancy
s
direction
as
well
as
in
her
brother
s
but
the
disclosure
of
nancy
s
marriage
and
horace
s
persistency
in
unfriendliness
brought
damerel
to
a
sense
of
peril
one
offer
of
marriage
she
had
received
and
declined
it
came
from
a
man
of
advanced
years
and
small
property
another
offer
she
might
or
thought
she
might
at
any
moment
provoke
but
only
in
direst
extremity
could
she
think
of
bestowing
her
hand
upon
luckworth
crewe
crewe
was
in
love
with
her
an
amusing
fact
in
itself
and
especially
so
in
regard
to
his
former
relations
with
nancy
lord
he
might
become
a
wealthy
man
on
the
other
hand
he
might
not
and
in
any
case
he
was
a
plebeian
all
such
miseries
were
now
dismissed
from
her
mind
she
went
abroad
with
the
chittles
enjoyed
herself
at
brighton
and
came
home
to
prepare
for
horace
s
wedding
horace
himself
being
at
bournemouth
after
her
letter
of
gratitude
to
crewe
she
had
ceased
to
correspond
with
him
she
did
not
trouble
to
acquaint
him
with
horace
s
engagement
and
when
crewe
having
heard
the
news
from
his
partner
ventured
to
send
her
a
letter
of
congratulation
damerel
replied
in
two
or
three
very
civil
but
cold
sentences
back
in
london
she
did
not
invite
the
man
of
projects
to
call
upon
her
the
status
she
had
lost
when
fears
beset
her
must
now
be
recovered
let
crewe
cherish
a
passion
for
her
if
he
liked
but
let
him
understand
that
social
reasons
made
it
laughably
hopeless
horace
was
to
come
up
to
london
in
the
third
week
of
december
and
to
be
married
on
new
year
s
day
the
honeymoon
would
be
spent
at
ventnor
or
somewhere
thereabout
afraid
to
lose
sight
of
her
relative
for
more
than
a
week
or
two
damerel
had
already
been
twice
to
bournemouth
and
now
she
decided
to
go
for
a
third
time
just
to
talk
quietly
over
the
forthcoming
event
and
whether
horace
broached
the
subject
or
not
to
apprise
him
of
the
straits
into
which
she
was
drifting
unannounced
by
letter
she
reached
bournemouth
early
in
the
afternoon
and
went
straight
to
horace
s
lodgings
the
young
man
had
just
finished
luncheon
and
all
things
considered
including
the
fact
that
it
was
a
remarkably
bright
and
warm
day
for
the
time
of
year
he
might
have
been
expected
to
welcome
damerel
cheerfully
yet
on
seeing
her
his
countenance
fell
he
betrayed
an
embarrassment
which
the
lady
noted
with
anxious
suspicion
aren
t
you
glad
to
see
me
dear
boy
she
began
with
a
kiss
upon
his
cheek
yes
oh
yes
i
never
dreamt
of
your
appearing
just
now
that
was
i
couldn
t
resist
the
temptation
such
a
morning
in
london
almost
as
fine
as
it
is
here
and
how
is
your
cough
even
as
she
made
the
inquiry
he
answered
it
by
coughing
very
badly
i
don
t
think
this
place
suits
you
horace
said
damerel
gravely
you
re
not
imprudent
i
hope
don
t
go
out
after
dark
oh
it
was
nothing
horace
maintained
for
several
days
he
had
hardly
coughed
at
all
but
with
every
word
he
uttered
damerel
became
more
convinced
of
something
unusual
in
his
state
of
mind
he
could
not
keep
still
and
in
trying
to
put
himself
at
ease
assumed
strange
postures
when
did
you
hear
from
winifred
she
asked
yesterday
no
the
day
he
shrank
from
her
scrutiny
and
an
expression
of
annoyance
began
to
disturb
his
features
damerel
knew
well
enough
the
significance
of
that
particular
look
it
meant
the
irritation
of
his
the
summoning
of
forces
to
resist
something
he
disliked
there
has
been
no
difference
between
you
i
hope
no
oh
no
horace
replied
wriggling
under
her
look
at
that
moment
a
servant
opened
the
door
two
ladies
have
called
in
a
carriage
sir
and
would
like
to
see
i
ll
go
down
excuse
me
for
a
moment
who
are
they
horace
asked
damerel
rising
with
an
look
of
dismay
some
friends
i
have
made
here
i
ll
just
go
and
speak
to
he
hurried
away
no
sooner
was
he
gone
than
damerel
sprang
to
the
window
where
she
could
look
down
upon
the
carriage
standing
before
the
house
it
was
open
and
in
it
sat
two
ladies
one
the
other
much
younger
to
her
vexation
she
could
not
from
this
distance
clearly
discern
their
faces
but
on
glancing
rapidly
round
the
room
she
saw
horace
s
little
binocular
an
instant
brought
it
into
focus
upon
the
carriage
and
what
she
then
saw
gave
damerel
such
a
shock
that
an
exclamation
escaped
her
still
she
gazed
through
the
glasses
and
only
turned
away
when
the
vehicle
drove
on
horace
came
up
flushed
and
panting
it
s
all
right
they
wanted
me
to
go
for
a
drive
but
i
explained
he
saw
the
binocular
in
damerel
s
hand
and
at
the
same
moment
read
detection
on
her
countenance
she
gazed
at
him
he
answered
the
look
with
lowering
challenge
horace
that
was
fanny
so
it
was
what
is
going
on
between
you
the
young
man
took
a
seat
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
swung
his
leg
he
looked
suddenly
obstinate
we
met
by
accident
here
the
other
how
can
i
believe
that
horace
said
damerel
in
a
voice
of
soft
reproach
and
she
drew
near
to
him
be
truthful
with
me
dear
do
tell
me
the
truth
is
she
anything
to
you
i
have
told
you
the
truth
aunt
she
came
here
as
i
have
done
for
her
health
i
haven
t
seen
her
for
two
and
you
don
t
wish
to
renew
acquaintance
with
her
i
m
sure
you
don
he
looked
away
and
said
nothing
my
dear
do
you
know
her
character
what
about
her
the
tone
was
startling
but
damerel
kept
firm
though
agitated
she
has
led
the
most
disgraceful
life
i
heard
about
her
half
a
year
after
she
ran
away
but
of
course
i
wouldn
t
tell
you
such
painful
horace
reddened
with
anger
and
who
is
to
blame
for
it
he
cried
passionately
who
drove
her
to
it
oh
don
t
don
t
come
back
to
that
again
horace
pleaded
the
other
how
can
any
one
drive
a
girl
into
a
life
of
scandalous
immorality
it
was
in
herself
dear
she
took
to
it
naturally
as
so
many
women
do
remember
that
letter
she
wrote
from
brussels
which
i
sent
you
a
copy
of
it
was
a
forgery
thundered
horace
i
have
asked
her
she
says
she
never
wrote
any
such
then
she
lies
as
such
creatures
always
bitterness
of
apprehension
overcame
damerel
s
prudence
with
flashing
eyes
she
faced
the
young
man
and
dared
his
wrath
as
they
stood
thus
the
two
were
astonishingly
like
each
other
from
forehead
to
chin
it
s
no
use
i
m
not
going
to
quarrel
with
you
aunt
think
what
you
like
of
miss
french
know
the
truth
about
he
slipped
from
the
table
and
moved
away
i
will
say
no
more
horace
you
are
independent
and
must
have
your
own
acquaintances
but
after
you
are
married
the
other
voice
interrupted
i
had
better
tell
you
at
once
i
shall
not
marry
miss
chittle
i
am
going
to
write
this
afternoon
to
break
it
damerel
went
pale
and
stood
motionless
horace
you
can
t
be
so
wicked
as
that
it
s
better
he
pursued
recklessly
to
break
it
off
now
than
to
marry
her
and
make
her
miserable
i
don
t
love
her
and
i
have
never
really
thought
i
did
i
was
going
to
marry
her
only
for
her
money
why
she
wants
to
marry
me
i
don
t
know
there
s
something
wrong
she
doesn
t
really
care
for
she
does
i
assure
you
she
does
then
i
can
t
help
damerel
went
close
to
him
and
touched
his
arm
my
dear
her
voice
was
so
low
that
it
seemed
you
don
t
mean
to
marry
any
one
else
he
drew
apart
she
followed
him
oh
that
would
be
terrible
what
can
i
say
to
open
your
eyes
and
show
you
what
you
are
doing
horace
have
you
no
sense
of
honour
can
you
find
it
in
your
heart
to
cast
off
a
girl
who
loves
you
and
thinks
that
in
so
short
a
time
she
will
be
your
wife
this
again
is
your
fault
he
replied
with
a
violence
which
proved
the
conflict
of
emotions
in
him
but
for
you
i
should
never
have
proposed
to
winifred
never
dreamt
of
such
a
thing
what
do
i
want
with
her
money
i
have
enough
of
my
own
and
i
shall
make
more
in
business
why
have
you
driven
me
into
this
did
you
expect
to
get
some
profit
out
of
it
the
blow
struck
home
and
damerel
flinched
i
had
your
happiness
in
view
my
my
happiness
that
s
your
view
of
things
that
s
why
i
couldn
t
really
like
you
from
the
first
you
think
of
nothing
but
money
why
you
objected
to
fanny
french
at
first
was
because
you
wished
me
to
marry
some
one
richer
i
don
t
thank
you
for
that
kind
of
happiness
i
had
rather
marry
a
woman
i
can
and
you
can
love
such
a
creature
as
that
again
she
lost
her
the
mere
thought
of
fanny
s
possible
triumph
exasperated
her
i
won
t
hear
her
abused
cried
horace
with
answering
passion
you
are
the
last
person
who
ought
to
do
it
comparing
her
and
you
i
can
t
help
saying
an
exclamation
of
pain
checked
his
random
words
he
looked
at
damerel
and
saw
her
features
wrung
with
anguish
you
mustn
t
speak
to
me
like
that
once
more
she
approached
him
if
you
only
knew
i
can
t
bear
it
i
ve
always
been
a
worldly
woman
but
you
are
breaking
my
heart
horace
my
dear
my
dear
if
only
out
of
pity
for
me
why
should
i
pity
you
he
cried
impatiently
because
horace
give
me
your
hand
dear
let
me
tell
you
i
am
your
she
sobbed
and
choked
clinging
to
his
arm
resting
her
forehead
against
it
the
young
man
stricken
with
amazement
stared
at
her
speechless
i
am
your
own
mother
dear
she
went
on
in
a
quivering
voice
your
mother
and
nancy
s
and
neither
of
you
can
love
how
can
that
be
horace
asked
with
genuine
perplexity
how
could
you
have
married
some
one
else
she
passed
an
arm
about
his
neck
and
hid
her
face
against
him
i
left
your
father
and
he
made
me
free
to
marry
you
were
divorced
horace
did
not
mean
to
speak
brutally
in
his
wonderment
he
merely
pressed
for
a
complete
explanation
the
answer
was
a
sob
and
for
some
moments
neither
of
them
spoke
then
the
mother
her
face
still
hidden
went
on
in
a
thick
voice
i
married
because
i
was
poor
for
no
other
reason
and
then
came
the
temptation
i
behaved
wickedly
i
deserted
my
little
children
don
t
revenge
yourself
upon
me
now
darling
if
only
i
could
have
told
you
this
before
i
did
so
want
to
but
i
was
afraid
i
had
to
conceal
half
my
love
for
you
you
can
t
imagine
how
i
have
suffered
from
your
anger
and
from
nancy
s
coldness
you
don
t
know
me
i
have
never
been
able
to
let
you
see
what
i
really
think
and
feel
i
am
worldly
i
can
t
live
without
luxuries
and
society
and
amusements
but
i
love
you
my
dear
son
and
it
will
break
my
heart
if
you
ruin
yourself
it
s
true
i
thought
of
winifred
s
money
but
she
is
very
fond
of
you
horace
her
mother
has
told
me
she
is
and
it
was
because
of
my
own
position
i
have
spent
nearly
all
my
husband
left
me
it
wasn
t
enough
to
supply
me
with
an
income
i
could
only
hope
that
something
that
you
dear
would
forgive
your
poor
mother
and
help
her
if
you
cast
me
off
what
shall
i
do
there
was
a
silence
then
the
young
man
spoke
gravely
you
are
welcome
mother
to
half
my
income
but
you
must
leave
me
free
to
marry
as
i
then
i
can
t
take
a
penny
from
you
she
answered
weeping
if
you
ruin
yourself
you
ruin
me
as
the
ruin
would
come
if
i
married
winifred
i
love
fanny
i
love
her
with
all
my
heart
and
soul
and
have
never
ceased
to
love
her
tell
me
what
you
like
about
her
it
will
make
no
a
fit
of
violent
coughing
stopped
his
speech
he
turned
away
and
stood
by
the
window
holding
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
damerel
sank
upon
a
chair
in
mute
misery
chapter
below
the
hill
at
harrow
in
a
byway
which
has
no
charm
but
that
of
quietness
stands
a
row
of
small
plain
houses
built
not
long
ago
yet
at
a
time
when
small
houses
were
constructed
with
some
regard
for
soundness
and
durability

at
the
far
end
of
the
row
as
the
inhabitants
described
it
was
then
tenanted
by
mary
woodruff
and
with
her
as
a
lodger
lived
tarrant
as
a
lodger
seeing
that
she
paid
a
specified
weekly
sum
for
her
shelter
and
maintenance
in
no
other
respect
could
the
wretched
title
apply
to
her
to
occupy
furnished
lodgings
is
to
live
in
a
house
owned
and
ruled
by
servants
the
least
tolerable
status
known
to
civilisation
from
her
long
experience
at
falmouth
nancy
knew
enough
of
the
petty
miseries
attendant
upon
that
condition
to
think
of
it
with
dread
when
the
stress
of
heroic
crisis
compelled
her
speedy
departure
from
the
old
home
it
is
seldom
that
heroic
crisis
bears
the
precise
consequence
presumed
by
the
actors
in
it
supreme
moments
are
wont
to
result
in
some
form
of
compromise
so
nancy
prepared
to
go
forth
into
the
wilderness
of
landladies
babe
in
arm
found
that
so
dreary
a
neither
was
exacted
of
her
nor
would
indeed
be
permitted
she
had
to
reckon
with
mary
woodruff
mary
thanks
to
her
old
master
enjoyed
an
income
more
than
sufficient
to
her
needs
if
nancy
must
needs
go
into
lodgings
inevitable
perhaps
as
matters
stood
her
friend
was
ready
with
kind
and
practical
suggestion
to
wit
that
she
should
take
and
furnish
a
house
for
herself
and
place
a
portion
of
it
at
tarrant
s
disposal
to
this
even
tarrant
could
offer
no
objection
he
stipulated
only
that
his
wife
should
find
a
temporary
refuge
from
the
home
she
had
occupied
on
false
pretences
until
mary
had
her
new
house
in
readiness
this
was
managed
without
difficulty
nancy
went
to
dulwich
and
for
several
weeks
dwelt
with
the
honest
woman
who
took
care
of
her
child
of
the
dealings
between
nancy
and
her
legal
guardians
tarrant
learned
nothing
save
the
bare
fact
that
her
marriage
was
avowed
and
all
benefit
under
her
father
s
will
renounced
he
did
not
visit
the
house
at
dulwich
and
only
saw
his
child
after
the
removal
to
harrow
on
this
occasion
he
asked
nancy
what
arrangements
had
been
made
concerning
the
money
that
must
be
reimbursed
to
the
messrs
barmby
she
replied
that
justice
would
be
done
but
the
affair
was
hers
alone
and
to
her
must
be
left
tarrant
himself
suggested
the
neighbourhood
of
harrow
for
nancy
s
abode
it
united
the
conditions
of
being
remote
from
camberwell
of
lying
beyond
the
great
and
of
permitting
him
poor
as
he
was
to
visit
his
wife
whenever
he
thought
fit
in
december
nancy
had
lived
thus
for
all
but
a
twelvemonth
seeing
the
while
none
of
her
old
acquaintances
and
with
very
little
news
from
her
old
world
what
she
heard
came
through
horace
who
after
learning
with
astonishment
the
secret
in
his
sister
s
life
came
by
degrees
to
something
like
the
old
terms
of
affection
with
her
and
went
over
to
harrow
pretty
frequently
of
his
engagement
to
winifred
chittle
he
at
once
informed
nancy
who
tried
to
be
glad
of
it
but
could
have
little
faith
in
anything
traceable
to
the
influence
of
damerel
with
that
lady
the
harrow
household
had
no
direct
communication
tarrant
had
written
to
her
on
the
night
of
crisis
civilly
requesting
her
to
keep
aloof
as
her
advice
and
assistance
were
in
nowise
needed
she
answered
him
with
good
temper
and
wrote
kindly
to
nancy
after
that
silence
on
both
sides
it
wanted
a
few
days
to
christmas
with
nightfall
had
come
a
roaring
wind
and
sleety
rain
the
was
locked
within
lamps
and
fires
burned
cheerily
at
six
nancy
she
occupied
the
two
front
rooms
sat
in
her
parlour
resting
after
the
exertion
of
putting
her
son
to
bed
to
judge
from
her
countenance
she
was
well
and
happy
the
furniture
about
her
aimed
at
nothing
but
homely
comfort
the
pictures
and
books
being
beyond
dispute
her
own
had
come
from
grove
lane
save
when
tarrant
was
here
nancy
and
mary
of
course
lived
like
friends
who
share
a
house
eating
together
and
generally
sitting
together
during
an
hour
or
two
each
day
the
younger
woman
desired
solitude
for
a
reason
understood
by
her
companion
who
then
looked
after
the
baby
this
present
evening
nancy
had
proposed
to
spend
alone
but
after
sitting
idly
for
a
few
minutes
she
opened
the
door
and
called
mary
just
then
occupied
in
teaching
a
young
servant
how
to
iron
i
shall
not
write
after
all
she
said
when
her
friend
came
i
m
too
tired
bring
your
sewing
or
your
book
mary
was
never
talkative
nancy
kept
a
longer
silence
than
usual
how
she
exclaimed
at
length
do
poor
women
with
a
lot
of
children
manage
it
really
is
a
mystery
to
me
here
am
i
with
one
baby
and
with
the
constant
help
of
two
people
yet
he
tires
me
out
not
a
troublesome
baby
either
healthy
and
yet
the
thought
and
anxiety
and
downright
hard
labour
for
a
good
twelve
hours
out
of
the
i
feel
that
a
second
child
would
be
too
much
for
she
laughed
but
looked
seriously
for
the
reply
poor
mothers
said
mary
can
t
give
the
same
care
to
their
children
that
you
give
to
baby
the
little
ones
grow
up
or
they
don
t
grow
up
that
s
what
it
comes
yes
that
is
to
say
only
the
fit
survive
a
very
good
thing
when
other
people
s
children
are
in
question
but
i
should
kill
myself
in
taking
care
of
them
if
i
had
a
large
i
have
known
mothers
who
did
mary
remarked
it
comes
to
this
nature
doesn
t
intend
a
married
woman
to
be
anything
a
married
woman
in
the
natural
state
of
things
she
must
either
be
the
slave
of
husband
and
children
or
defy
her
duty
she
can
have
no
time
to
herself
no
thoughts
for
herself
it
s
a
hard
saying
but
who
can
doubt
that
it
is
nature
s
law
i
should
like
to
revolt
against
it
yet
i
feel
revolt
to
be
silly
one
might
as
well
revolt
against
being
born
a
woman
instead
of
a
mary
reflected
but
held
her
peace
then
comes
in
money
pursued
nancy
and
that
alters
the
state
of
the
case
at
once
the
wife
with
money
says
to
people
come
here
and
be
my
slaves
toil
for
me
whilst
i
am
enjoying
myself
in
ways
that
dame
nature
wouldn
t
allow
i
want
to
read
to
play
music
to
see
my
friends
to
see
the
world
unless
you
will
slave
for
me
i
can
t
budge
from
nursery
and
isn
t
it
a
queer
thing
the
less
sophisticated
woman
had
a
difficulty
in
catching
nancy
s
point
of
view
she
began
to
argue
that
domestic
service
was
no
slavery
but
it
to
that
nancy
insisted
and
what
i
mean
is
that
the
thought
has
made
me
far
more
contented
than
i
was
at
first
after
all
one
can
put
up
with
a
great
deal
if
you
feel
you
re
obeying
a
law
of
nature
now
i
have
brains
and
i
should
like
to
use
them
but
nature
says
that
s
not
so
important
as
bringing
up
the
little
child
to
whom
i
have
given
life
one
thought
that
troubles
me
is
that
every
generation
of
women
is
sacrificed
to
the
generation
that
follows
and
of
course
that
s
why
women
are
so
inferior
to
men
but
then
again
nature
says
that
women
are
born
to
be
sacrificed
i
always
come
round
to
that
i
don
t
like
it
but
i
am
bound
to
believe
children
grow
up
said
mary
and
then
mothers
are
free
to
do
what
to
think
of
what
they
have
done
in
the
best
years
of
their
it
was
not
said
discontentedly
nancy
s
mood
seemed
to
be
singularly
calm
and
philosophical
she
propped
her
chin
on
her
hand
and
gazed
at
the
fire
well
remarked
mary
with
a
smile
you
at
all
events
are
not
one
of
the
poorest
women
all
seems
to
be
going
well
and
you
will
be
able
i
am
sure
to
get
all
the
help
you
perhaps
but
i
shall
never
feel
quiet
in
my
conscience
i
shall
feel
as
if
i
had
defeated
nature
by
a
trick
and
fear
that
she
ll
somehow
be
revenged
on
this
was
quite
beyond
mary
s
scope
of
thought
and
she
frankly
said
so
one
thing
i
m
quite
sure
of
nancy
she
added
and
that
is
that
education
makes
life
very
much
harder
to
live
that
s
why
i
don
t
hold
with
educating
the
poor
not
beyond
reading
and
writing
without
education
life
is
very
plain
though
it
may
be
a
struggle
but
from
what
i
have
seen
of
people
i
m
very
sure
they
suffer
worse
in
their
minds
than
the
poor
ever
do
in
their
nancy
interrupted
her
hush
was
that
baby
only
the
wind
i
not
content
nancy
went
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
whilst
she
stood
there
listening
mary
came
out
and
said
in
a
low
voice
there
s
a
tap
at
the
no
you
must
have
been
i
m
sure
it
was
a
tap
on
the
she
withdrew
to
the
back
and
nancy
with
quick
step
went
to
open
the
a
great
gust
of
wind
forced
it
against
her
as
soon
as
she
turned
the
handle
standing
firm
she
peeped
into
darkness
any
one
there
no
enemy
but
winter
and
rough
weather
chanted
a
familiar
voice
why
what
brings
you
here
frightening
lone
women
at
this
time
of
night
shut
and
lock
the
door
for
me
the
house
will
be
blown
out
of
the
nancy
retreated
to
her
parlour
and
stood
there
in
an
attitude
of
joyous
expectation
without
hurry
tarrant
hung
up
his
coat
and
hat
in
the
passage
then
came
forward
wiping
rain
from
his
moustache
their
eyes
met
in
a
smile
frank
and
confident
why
have
you
come
lionel
no
reason
in
particular
the
fancy
took
me
am
i
unwelcome
for
answer
his
wife
s
arms
were
thrown
about
him
a
lovers
meeting
with
more
of
tenderness
and
scarcely
less
of
warmth
than
when
nancy
knocked
at
the
door
in
staple
inn
are
you
hungry
only
for
what
you
have
given
some
tea
then
after
that
wretched
no
how
s
the
boy
he
drew
her
upon
his
knee
and
listened
laughingly
whilst
the
newest
marvels
of
babyhood
were
laughingly
related
anything
from
horace
not
a
word
he
must
be
in
london
now
i
shall
write
tarrant
nodded
carelessly
he
had
the
smallest
interest
in
his
wife
s
brother
but
could
not
help
satisfaction
in
the
thought
that
horace
was
to
be
reputably
and
even
brilliantly
married
from
all
he
knew
of
horace
the
probability
had
seemed
that
his
marriage
would
be
some
culmination
of
folly
i
think
you
have
something
to
tell
me
nancy
said
presently
when
her
hand
had
been
fondled
for
a
minute
or
two
nothing
much
but
good
as
far
as
it
goes
bunbury
has
asked
me
to
write
him
an
article
every
week
for
the
first
six
months
of
column
and
a
half
at
two
guineas
a
three
guineas
a
o
rare
head
so
there
s
no
anxiety
for
the
first
half
of
next
year
at
all
events
said
nancy
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
think
i
can
count
on
a
margin
of
fifty
pounds
or
so
by
midsummer
towards
the
debt
of
nancy
bit
her
lip
in
vexation
but
neither
made
nor
wished
to
make
any
protest
only
a
week
or
two
ago
since
entering
upon
his
patrimony
horace
lord
had
advanced
the
sum
necessary
to
repay
what
nancy
owed
to
the
barmbys
however
rich
horace
was
going
to
be
this
debt
to
him
must
be
cancelled
on
that
as
on
most
other
points
tarrant
and
his
wife
held
a
firm
agreement
of
opinion
yet
they
wanted
money
the
past
year
had
been
a
time
of
struggle
to
make
ends
meet
neither
was
naturally
disposed
to
asceticism
and
if
they
did
not
grumble
it
was
only
because
grumbling
would
have
been
undignified
did
you
dine
with
the
great
people
on
thursday
nancy
asked
yes
and
rather
enjoyed
it
there
were
one
or
two
clever
been
anywhere
else
an
hour
at
a
the
other
evening
pippit
the
actor
was
there
and
recited
a
piece
much
better
than
i
ever
heard
him
speak
anything
on
the
stage
they
told
me
he
was
drunk
very
possibly
that
accounted
for
to
a
number
of
such
details
nancy
listened
quietly
with
bent
head
she
had
learned
to
put
absolute
faith
in
all
that
tarrant
told
her
of
his
life
she
suspected
no
concealment
but
the
monotony
of
her
own
days
lay
heavy
upon
her
whilst
he
talked
won
t
you
smoke
she
asked
rising
from
his
knee
to
fetch
the
pipe
and
kept
for
him
upon
a
shelf
slippers
also
she
brought
him
and
would
have
unlaced
his
muddy
boots
had
tarrant
permitted
it
when
he
presented
a
picture
of
masculine
comfort
nancy
sitting
opposite
cautiously
approached
a
subject
of
which
as
yet
there
had
been
no
word
between
them
oughtn
t
you
to
get
more
comfortable
lodgings
oh
i
do
very
well
i
m
accustomed
to
the
place
and
i
like
the
he
had
kept
his
room
in
great
college
street
though
often
obliged
to
scant
his
meals
as
the
weekly
approached
don
t
you
think
we
might
make
some
better
some
more
economical
arrangement
how
nancy
took
courage
and
spoke
her
thoughts
it
s
more
expensive
to
live
separately
than
if
we
were
tarrant
seemed
to
give
the
point
his
impartial
consideration
h
m
no
i
think
not
certainly
not
with
our
present
arrangements
and
even
if
it
were
we
pay
for
your
comfort
and
my
couldn
t
you
have
as
much
liberty
if
we
were
living
under
the
same
roof
of
course
i
know
that
you
couldn
t
live
out
here
it
would
put
a
stop
to
your
work
at
once
but
suppose
we
moved
mary
might
take
a
rather
larger
house
it
needn
t
be
much
larger
in
a
part
convenient
for
you
we
should
be
able
to
pay
her
enough
to
set
off
against
her
increased
smoking
calmly
tarrant
shook
his
head
impracticable
do
you
mean
that
this
place
is
too
dull
for
you
it
isn
t
lively
but
i
wasn
t
thinking
of
the
place
if
lived
here
it
would
be
all
i
should
that
sounds
so
prettily
from
your
lips
nancy
that
i
m
half
ashamed
to
contradict
it
but
the
truth
is
that
you
can
only
say
such
things
because
we
live
apart
don
t
deceive
yourself
with
a
little
more
money
this
life
of
ours
would
be
as
nearly
perfect
as
married
life
ever
can
nancy
remembered
a
previous
occasion
when
he
spoke
to
the
same
purpose
but
it
was
in
the
time
she
did
not
like
to
think
of
and
in
spite
of
herself
the
recollection
troubled
her
you
must
have
more
variety
he
added
next
year
you
shall
come
into
town
much
oftener
i
m
not
thinking
of
that
i
always
like
going
anywhere
with
you
but
i
have
plenty
of
occupations
and
pleasures
at
i
think
we
ought
to
be
under
the
same
ought
because
tomkins
would
cry
if
her
husband
the
greengrocer
wasn
t
at
her
elbow
day
and
night
have
more
patience
with
me
i
didn
t
mean
in
the
vulgar
sense
i
have
as
little
respect
for
tomkins
as
you
have
i
don
t
want
to
interfere
with
your
liberty
for
a
moment
indeed
it
would
be
very
foolish
for
i
know
that
it
would
make
you
detest
me
but
i
so
often
want
to
speak
to
you
and
and
then
i
can
t
quite
feel
that
you
acknowledge
me
as
your
wife
so
long
as
i
am
tarrant
nodded
i
quite
understand
the
social
difficulty
well
there
s
no
doubt
it
is
a
difficulty
i
feel
it
on
your
account
i
wish
it
were
possible
for
you
to
be
invited
wherever
i
am
some
day
it
will
be
if
i
don
t
get
run
over
in
the
strand
but
i
should
like
the
invitations

broke
in
but
you
still
don
t
understand
yes
i
think
i
do
you
are
a
woman
and
it
s
quite
impossible
for
a
woman
to
see
this
matter
as
a
man
does
nancy
there
is
not
one
wife
in
fifty
thousand
who
retains
her
husband
s
love
after
the
first
year
of
marriage
put
aside
the
fools
and
the
worthless
think
only
of
women
with
whom
you
might
be
compared
brave
sensible
they
can
win
love
but
don
t
know
how
to
keep
why
not
put
it
the
other
way
about
and
say
that
men
can
love
to
begin
with
but
so
soon
grow
careless
because
i
am
myself
an
instance
to
the
nancy
smiled
but
was
not
satisfied
the
only
married
people
tarrant
pursued
who
can
live
together
with
impunity
are
those
who
are
rich
enough
and
sensible
enough
to
have
two
distinct
establishments
under
the
same
roof
the
ordinary
eight
or
house
inhabited
by
decent
folk
is
a
gruesome
sight
what
a
huddlement
of
male
and
female
they
are
factories
of
quarrel
and
hate
those
respectable
sties
they
are
full
of
things
that
won
t
bear
mentioning
if
our
income
never
rises
above
that
we
shall
live
to
the
end
of
our
days
as
we
do
nancy
looked
appalled
but
how
can
you
hope
to
make
thousands
a
year
i
have
no
such
hope
hundreds
would
be
sufficient
i
don
t
aim
at
a
house
in
london
everything
there
is
intolerable
except
the
fine
old
houses
which
have
a
history
and
which
i
could
never
afford
for
my
home
i
want
to
find
some
rambling
old
place
among
hills
and
woods
some
house
where
generations
have
lived
and
died
where
my
boy
as
he
grows
up
may
learn
to
love
the
old
and
beautiful
things
about
him
i
myself
never
had
a
home
most
london
children
don
t
know
what
is
meant
by
home
their
houses
are
only
more
or
less
comfortable
lodgings
perpetual
change
within
and
your
thoughts
are
wonderfully
like
my
father
s
sometimes
said
nancy
from
what
you
have
told
me
of
him
i
think
we
should
have
agreed
in
a
good
many
and
how
unfortunate
we
were
if
he
had
recovered
from
that
illness
if
he
had
lived
only
a
few
months
everything
would
have
been
made
for
me
altogether
too
easy
tarrant
observed
it
has
been
a
good
thing
for
you
to
have
to
work
nancy
assented
i
understand
the
change
for
the
better
in
you
but
she
smiled
you
have
more
than
you
used
to
that
s
just
where
i
have
but
don
t
think
that
i
find
it
easy
or
pleasant
to
resist
your
wish
i
couldn
t
do
it
if
i
were
not
so
sure
that
i
am
acting
for
your
advantage
as
well
as
my
own
a
man
who
finds
himself
married
to
a
fool
is
a
fool
himself
if
he
doesn
t
take
his
own
course
regardless
of
his
wife
but
i
am
in
a
very
different
position
i
love
you
more
and
more
nancy
because
i
am
learning
more
and
more
to
respect
you
i
think
of
your
happiness
most
assuredly
as
much
as
i
think
of
my
own
but
even
if
my
own
good
weighed
as
nothing
against
yours
i
should
be
wise
to
resist
you
just
as
i
do
now
marriage
is
a
defilement
and
a
curse
we
know
it
from
the
experience
of
the
world
at
large
which
is
perhaps
more
brutalised
by
marriage
than
by
anything
no
need
to
test
the
thing
once
more
to
our
own
what
i
think
is
that
though
you
pay
me
compliments
you
really
have
a
very
poor
opinion
of
me
you
think
i
should
burden
and
worry
you
in
endless
silly
ways
i
am
not
such
a
simpleton
in
however
small
a
house
there
could
be
your
rooms
and
mine
do
you
suppose
i
should
interfere
with
your
freedom
in
coming
and
going
whether
you
meant
to
or
not
you
would
so
long
as
we
are
struggling
with
poverty
however
i
am
i
am
not
selfish
and
to
see
you
living
a
monotonous
imprisoned
life
would
be
a
serious
hindrance
to
me
in
my
own
living
and
working
of
course
the
fact
is
so
at
present
and
i
often
enough
think
in
a
troubled
way
about
you
but
you
are
out
of
my
sight
and
that
enables
me
to
keep
you
out
of
mind
if
i
am
away
from
home
till
one
or
two
in
the
morning
there
is
no
lonely
wife
fretting
and
wondering
about
me
for
work
such
as
mine
i
must
live
as
though
i
were
not
married
at
but
suppose
we
got
out
of
our
poverty
urged
nancy
you
would
be
living
the
same
life
i
suppose
and
how
would
it
be
any
better
for
you
or
me
that
we
had
a
large
house
instead
of
a
small
one
your
position
will
be
totally
changed
when
money
comes
friends
come
you
are
not
hiding
away
from
society
because
you
are
unfit
for
it
only
because
you
can
t
live
as
your
social
equals
do
when
you
have
friends
of
your
own
social
engagements
interests
on
every
hand
i
shall
be
able
to
go
my
own
way
without
a
pang
of
conscience
when
we
come
together
it
will
be
to
talk
of
your
affairs
as
well
as
of
mine
living
as
you
do
now
you
have
nothing
on
earth
but
the
baby
to
think
about
a
miserable
state
of
things
for
a
woman
with
a
mind
i
know
it
is
miserable
and
i
m
struggling
tooth
and
nail
to
help
you
out
of
nancy
sighed
then
there
are
years
of
it
still
before
heaven
forbid
some
years
no
doubt
before
we
shall
have
a
home
but
not
before
i
can
bring
you
in
contact
with
the
kind
of
people
you
ought
to
know
you
shall
have
a
decent
house
socially
possible
somewhere
out
west
and
i
of
course
shall
still
go
on
in
he
waited
for
nancy
s
reply
but
she
kept
silence
you
are
still
dissatisfied
she
looked
up
and
commanded
her
features
to
the
expression
which
makes
whatever
woman
lovely
that
of
rational
acquiescence
on
the
faces
of
most
women
such
look
is
never
seen
no
i
am
content
you
are
working
hard
and
i
won
t
make
it
harder
for
speak
always
like
that
tarrant
s
face
was
radiant
that
s
the
kind
of
thing
that
binds
man
to
woman
body
and
soul
with
the
memory
of
that
look
and
speech
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
slight
you
in
my
life
apart
it
makes
you
my
friend
and
the
word
friend
is
better
to
my
ear
than
wife
a
man
s
wife
is
more
often
than
not
his
enemy
harvey
munden
was
telling
me
of
a
poor
devil
of
an
author
who
daren
t
be
out
after
ten
at
night
because
of
the
waiting
for
him
at
nancy
laughed
i
suppose
she
can
t
trust
and
suppose
she
can
t
what
is
the
value
of
nominal
fidelity
secured
by
mutual
degradation
such
as
that
a
rational
woman
would
infinitely
rather
have
a
husband
who
was
often
unfaithful
to
her
than
keep
him
faithful
by
such
means
husband
and
wife
should
interfere
with
each
other
not
a
jot
more
than
two
friends
of
the
same
sex
living
together
if
a
man
under
such
circumstances
worried
his
friend
s
life
out
by
petty
prying
he
would
get
his
head
punched
a
wife
has
no
more
justification
in
worrying
her
husband
with
how
if
it
were
the
wife
that
excited
suspicion
asked
nancy
infidelity
in
a
woman
is
much
worse
than
in
a
man
if
a
man
really
suspects
his
wife
he
must
leave
her
that
s
all
then
let
her
justify
herself
if
she
nancy
cared
little
to
discuss
this
point
in
argument
with
any
one
else
she
would
doubtless
have
maintained
the
equality
of
man
and
woman
before
the
moral
law
but
that
would
only
have
been
in
order
to
prove
herself
tarrant
s
dictum
did
not
revolt
her
friends
are
equals
she
said
after
a
little
thought
but
you
don
t
think
me
your
equal
and
you
won
t
be
satisfied
with
me
unless
i
follow
your
tarrant
laughed
kindly
true
i
am
your
superior
in
force
of
mind
and
force
of
body
don
t
you
like
to
hear
that
doesn
t
it
do
you
good
when
you
think
of
the
maudlin
humbug
generally
talked
by
men
to
women
we
can
t
afford
to
disguise
that
truth
all
the
same
we
are
friends
because
each
has
the
other
s
interest
at
heart
and
each
would
be
ashamed
to
doubt
the
other
s
the
latter
part
of
the
evening
they
spent
with
mary
in
whom
tarrant
always
found
something
new
to
admire
he
regarded
her
as
the
most
wonderful
phenomenon
in
nature
an
uneducated
woman
who
was
neither
vulgar
nor
foolish
baby
slept
in
a
cot
beside
nancy
s
bed
for
fear
of
waking
him
the
wedded
lovers
entered
their
room
very
softly
with
a
shaded
candle
tarrant
looked
at
the
curly
little
head
the
little
clenched
hand
and
gave
a
silent
laugh
of
pleasure
on
the
next
morning
lay
a
letter
from
horace
as
soon
as
she
had
opened
it
nancy
uttered
an
exclamation
which
prepared
her
companion
for
ill
news
just
what
i
expected
though
i
tried
not
to
think
so
i
write
aline
only
to
tell
you
that
my
marriage
is
broken
off
you
will
know
the
explanation
before
long
don
t
trouble
yourself
about
it
i
should
never
have
been
happy
with
winifred
nor
she
with
me
we
may
not
see
each
other
for
some
time
but
i
will
write
again
he
doesn
t
say
whether
he
or
she
broke
it
off
i
hope
it
was
i
m
afraid
not
said
tarrant
from
the
tone
of
that
i
m
afraid
not
too
it
means
something
wretched
he
writes
from
his
london
lodgings
lionel
let
me
go
back
with
you
and
see
by
all
her
gravest
fear
nancy
would
not
communicate
and
it
hit
the
truth
chapter
they
parted
at
baker
street
tarrant
for
his
lodgings
and
the
work
that
awaited
him
there
nancy
to
go
westward
by
another
train
when
she
reached
the
house
from
which
her
brother
had
dated
his
letter
it
was
ten
at
the
door
stood
a
cab
and
a
servant
was
helping
the
driver
to
hoist
a
big
trunk
on
to
the
top
is
lord
still
here
nancy
asked
of
the
girl
he
s
just
this
minute
miss
this
is
his
she
sent
her
name
and
was
quickly
led
up
to
the
first
floor
there
stood
horace
ready
for
departure
why
have
you
come
he
asked
with
annoyance
what
else
could
i
do
on
hearing
such
news
i
told
you
i
should
write
again
and
i
said
plainly
that
it
was
better
we
shouldn
t
see
each
other
for
some
why
will
people
pester
me
out
of
my
life
i
m
not
a
child
to
be
hunted
like
this
on
the
instant
he
had
fallen
into
a
state
of
excitement
which
alarmed
his
sister
there
were
drops
of
sweat
on
his
forehead
and
tears
in
his
eyes
the
blood
had
rushed
to
his
cheeks
and
he
trembled
violently
i
am
so
troubled
about
you
said
nancy
with
anxious
tenderness
i
have
been
looking
forward
with
such
hope
to
your
marriage
and
now
i
can
t
tell
you
anything
about
it
just
now
it
was
all
damerel
s
doing
the
engagement
i
mean
it
s
a
good
thing
i
drew
back
in
but
i
have
a
train
to
catch
i
really
mustn
t
stay
are
you
going
far
horace
to
bournemouth
again
for
the
present
i
ve
given
up
these
rooms
and
i
m
taking
all
my
things
away
in
a
month
or
two
i
may
go
abroad
but
i
ll
let
you
already
he
was
out
of
the
room
his
sister
had
no
choice
but
to
follow
him
downstairs
he
looked
so
ill
and
behaved
with
such
lack
of
that
nancy
kept
her
eyes
upon
him
in
an
awestricken
gaze
as
though
watching
some
one
on
the
headlong
way
to
destruction
pouring
rain
obliged
her
to
put
up
her
umbrella
as
she
stepped
down
on
to
the
pavement
horace
having
shouted
a
direction
to
the
driver
entered
the
cab
you
haven
t
even
shaken
hands
with
me
horace
nancy
exclaimed
standing
at
the
window
dear
you
shouldn
t
have
come
in
weather
such
as
this
get
home
as
fast
as
you
can
tell
the
fellow
to
drive
and
the
cab
clattered
away
sending
spurts
of
mud
on
to
nancy
s
waterproof
she
walked
on
for
a
few
paces
without
reflection
until
the
vehicle
disappeared
round
a
corner
coming
to
herself
she
made
for
the
railway
again
which
was
at
only
a
few
minutes
distance
and
there
she
sat
down
by
the
fire
in
the
her
health
for
the
last
year
had
been
sound
as
in
the
days
of
girlhood
it
was
rarely
that
she
caught
cold
and
weather
would
have
been
indifferent
to
her
but
for
the
discomfort
which
hindered
her
free
movement
vexed
at
so
futile
a
journey
she
resolved
not
to
return
home
without
making
another
effort
to
learn
something
about
horace
the
only
person
to
whom
she
could
apply
was
the
one
who
would
certainly
be
possessed
of
information
damerel
at
the
time
of
horace
s
engagement
nancy
had
heard
from
damerel
and
replied
to
the
letter
she
remembered
her
aunt
s
address
and
as
the
distance
was
not
great
the
temptation
to
go
there
now
proved
irresistible
her
husband
would
dislike
to
hear
of
such
a
step
but
he
had
never
forbidden
communication
with
damerel
by
help
of
train
and
omnibus
she
reached
her
new
destination
in
and
felt
a
relief
on
learning
that
damerel
was
at
home
but
it
surprised
her
to
be
conducted
into
a
room
where
lamps
were
burning
and
blinds
drawn
close
she
passed
suddenly
from
cheerless
day
to
cosy
evening
damerel
negligently
attired
received
her
with
a
show
of
warm
welcome
but
appeared
nervous
and
out
of
spirits
i
am
not
very
well
she
admitted
and
that
s
why
i
have
shut
out
the
dreadful
weather
isn
t
it
the
most
sensible
way
of
getting
through
the
worst
of
a
london
winter
to
pretend
that
there
is
daylight
is
quite
ridiculous
so
one
may
as
well
have
the
comforts
of
i
have
come
to
speak
about
horace
said
nancy
at
once
in
any
case
she
would
have
felt
embarrassment
and
it
was
increased
by
the
look
with
which
damerel
kept
regarding
her
a
look
of
confusion
of
shrinking
of
intense
and
painful
scrutiny
you
know
what
has
happened
i
had
a
letter
from
him
this
morning
to
say
that
his
marriage
was
broken
off
nothing
else
so
i
came
over
from
harrow
to
see
him
but
he
had
hardly
a
minute
to
speak
to
me
he
was
just
starting
for
and
what
did
he
tell
you
asked
damerel
who
remained
standing
or
rather
had
risen
after
a
pretence
of
seating
herself
nothing
at
all
he
was
very
strange
in
his
manner
he
said
he
would
you
know
that
he
is
seriously
ill
i
am
afraid
he
must
he
has
grown
much
worse
during
the
last
fortnight
don
t
you
suspect
any
reason
for
his
throwing
off
poor
winifred
i
wondered
whether
he
had
met
that
girl
again
but
it
seemed
very
he
has
she
was
at
bournemouth
for
her
health
she
too
is
ill
consumptive
like
poor
horace
of
course
a
result
of
the
life
she
has
been
leading
and
he
is
going
to
marry
nancy
s
heart
sank
she
could
say
nothing
she
remembered
horace
s
face
and
saw
in
him
the
victim
of
ruthless
destiny
i
have
done
my
utmost
he
didn
t
speak
of
me
only
to
say
that
his
engagement
with
winifred
was
brought
about
by
and
wasn
t
i
justified
if
the
poor
boy
must
die
he
would
at
least
have
died
with
friends
about
him
and
in
peace
i
always
feared
just
what
has
happened
it
s
only
a
few
months
ago
that
he
forgave
me
for
being
as
he
thought
the
cause
of
that
girl
s
ruin
and
since
then
i
have
hardly
dared
to
lose
sight
of
him
i
went
down
to
bournemouth
unexpectedly
and
was
with
him
when
that
creature
came
to
the
door
in
a
carriage
you
haven
t
seen
her
she
looks
what
she
is
the
vilest
of
the
vile
as
if
any
one
can
be
held
responsible
for
that
she
was
born
to
be
what
she
is
and
if
i
had
the
power
i
would
crush
out
her
hateful
life
to
save
poor
horace
nancy
though
at
one
with
the
speaker
in
her
hatred
of
fanny
french
found
it
as
difficult
as
ever
to
feel
sympathetically
towards
damerel
she
could
not
credit
this
worldly
woman
with
genuine
affection
for
horace
the
vehemence
of
her
speech
surprised
and
troubled
her
she
knew
not
how
he
said
nothing
more
about
me
added
damerel
after
a
silence
nothing
at
it
seemed
to
nancy
that
she
heard
a
sigh
of
relief
the
other
s
face
was
turned
away
then
damerel
took
a
seat
by
the
fire
they
will
be
married
i
dare
say
at
bournemouth
no
use
trying
to
prevent
it
i
don
t
know
whether
you
will
believe
me
but
it
is
a
blow
that
will
darken
the
rest
of
my
her
voice
sounded
slightly
hoarse
and
she
lay
back
in
the
chair
with
drooping
head
you
have
nothing
to
reproach
yourself
with
said
nancy
yielding
to
a
vague
and
troublous
pity
and
you
have
done
as
much
as
any
one
could
on
his
i
shall
never
see
him
again
that
s
the
hardest
thought
she
will
poison
him
against
me
he
told
me
i
had
lied
to
him
about
a
letter
that
girl
wrote
from
brussels
she
has
made
him
think
her
a
spotless
innocent
and
he
hates
me
for
the
truth
i
told
about
however
short
his
life
said
nancy
he
is
only
too
likely
to
find
out
what
she
really
i
am
not
sure
of
that
she
knows
he
is
doomed
and
it
s
her
interest
to
play
a
part
he
will
die
thinking
the
worst
of
nancy
if
he
writes
to
you
and
says
anything
against
me
you
will
remember
what
it
means
my
opinion
of
people
is
not
affected
by
hearsay
nancy
replied
it
was
a
remark
of
dubious
significance
and
damerel
s
averted
eyes
seemed
to
show
that
she
derived
little
satisfaction
from
it
as
the
silence
was
unbroken
nancy
rose
i
hope
you
will
soon
get
rid
of
your
thank
you
my
dear
i
haven
t
asked
how
the
little
boy
is
well
i
hope
very
well
i
am
glad
to
and
your
husband
he
is
prospering
i
shouldn
t
like
to
say
he
is
prospering
it
seems
to
mean
so
much
but
i
think
he
is
doing
good
work
and
we
are
satisfied
with
the
my
dear
you
are
an
admirable
nancy
coloured
for
the
first
time
a
remark
of
damerel
s
had
given
her
pleasure
she
moved
forward
with
hand
offered
for
they
had
never
kissed
each
other
but
as
if
overcoming
diffidence
damerel
advanced
her
lips
then
as
suddenly
she
drew
back
i
had
forgotten
i
may
give
you
my
sore
nancy
kissed
her
cheek
that
night
damerel
was
feverish
and
the
next
day
she
kept
her
bed
the
servant
who
waited
upon
her
had
to
endure
a
good
many
sharp
reproofs
trouble
did
not
sweeten
this
lady
s
temper
yet
she
never
lost
sight
of
and
even
proved
herself
capable
of
acknowledging
that
she
was
in
the
wrong
damerel
possessed
the
elements
of
civilisation
this
illness
tried
her
patience
in
no
slight
degree
something
she
had
wished
to
do
something
of
high
moment
was
vexatiously
postponed
a
whole
week
went
by
before
she
could
safely
leave
the
house
and
even
then
her
mirror
counselled
a
new
delay
but
on
the
third
day
of
the
new
year
she
made
a
careful
toilette
and
sent
for
a
cab
the
brougham
she
had
been
wont
to
hire
being
now
beyond
her
means
she
drove
to
farringdon
street
and
climbed
to
the
office
of
mr
luckworth
crewe
her
knowledge
of
crewe
s
habits
enabled
her
to
choose
the
fitting
hour
for
this
call
he
had
lunched
and
was
smoking
a
cigar
how
delightful
to
see
you
here
he
exclaimed
but
why
did
you
trouble
to
come
if
you
had
written
or
telegraphed
i
would
have
saved
you
the
journey
i
haven
t
even
a
chair
that
s
fit
for
you
to
sit
down
what
nonsense
it
s
a
most
comfortable
little
room
haven
t
you
improved
it
since
i
called
i
shall
have
to
look
out
for
a
bigger
place
i
m
outgrowing
are
you
really
that
s
excellent
news
ah
but
what
sad
things
have
been
happening
it
s
a
bad
business
crewe
answered
shaking
his
head
i
thought
i
should
have
heard
from
you
about
the
reason
of
his
silence
she
perfectly
understood
since
horace
s
engagement
there
had
been
a
marked
change
in
her
demeanour
towards
the
man
of
business
she
had
answered
his
one
or
two
letters
with
such
cold
formality
and
on
the
one
occasion
of
his
venturing
to
call
had
received
him
with
so
marked
a
reserve
that
crewe
as
he
expressed
it
to
himself
got
his
back
his
ideas
of
chivalrous
devotion
were
anything
but
complex
he
could
not
bend
before
a
divinity
who
snubbed
him
if
the
once
gracious
lady
chose
to
avert
her
countenance
he
would
let
her
know
that
it
didn
t
matter
much
to
him
after
all
moreover
damerel
s
behaviour
was
too
suggestive
he
could
hardly
be
wrong
in
explaining
it
by
the
fact
that
her
nephew
about
to
be
enriched
by
marriage
might
henceforth
be
depended
upon
for
all
the
assistance
she
needed
this
in
the
americanism
which
came
naturally
to
crewe
s
lips
was
playing
it
rather
low
down
and
he
resented
it
the
sudden
ruin
of
horace
lord
s
prospects
he
had
learnt
the
course
of
events
from
horace
himself
amused
and
gratified
him
how
would
the
high
and
mighty
damerel
relish
this
catastrophe
would
she
have
the
cheek
to
return
to
her
old
graciousness
if
so
he
had
the
game
in
his
hands
she
should
see
that
he
was
not
to
be
made
a
fool
of
a
second
time
yet
the
mere
announcement
of
her
name
sufficed
to
shatter
his
resolve
her
smile
her
soft
accents
her
polished
manners
laid
the
old
spell
upon
him
he
sought
to
excuse
himself
for
having
forsaken
her
in
her
trial
it
really
floored
me
i
didn
t
know
what
to
say
or
do
i
was
afraid
you
might
think
i
was
meddling
with
what
didn
t
concern
oh
how
could
i
have
thought
that
it
has
made
me
ill
i
have
suffered
more
than
i
can
tell
you
don
t
look
quite
the
thing
said
crewe
searching
her
face
have
you
heard
all
i
think
so
he
is
married
and
that
s
the
end
of
it
i
damerel
winced
at
this
blunt
announcement
when
was
it
she
asked
in
an
undertone
i
only
knew
he
had
made
up
his
crewe
mentioned
the
date
the
day
after
nancy
s
call
upon
her
and
are
they
at
bournemouth
yes
will
be
for
a
month
or
so
he
well
we
won
t
talk
of
it
as
you
say
that
s
the
end
nothing
worse
could
have
happened
has
he
been
speaking
of
me
again
like
he
used
to
i
haven
t
heard
him
mention
your
she
heaved
a
sigh
and
began
to
look
round
the
office
let
us
try
to
forget
and
talk
of
pleasanter
things
it
seems
such
a
long
time
since
you
told
me
anything
about
your
business
you
remember
how
we
used
to
gossip
i
suppose
i
have
been
so
absorbed
in
that
poor
boy
s
affairs
it
made
me
selfish
i
was
so
overjoyed
i
really
could
think
of
nothing
else
and
now
but
i
must
and
will
drive
it
out
of
my
mind
i
have
been
moping
at
home
day
after
day
in
wretched
solitude
i
wanted
to
write
to
you
but
i
hadn
t
the
heart
scarcely
the
strength
i
kept
hoping
you
might
call
if
only
to
ask
how
i
was
of
course
everything
had
to
be
explained
to
inquisitive
people
how
i
hate
them
all
it
s
the
nature
of
the
world
to
mock
at
misfortunes
such
as
this
it
would
really
have
done
me
good
to
speak
for
a
few
minutes
with
such
a
friend
as
you
a
real
friend
i
am
going
to
live
a
quiet
retired
life
i
am
sick
of
the
world
its
falsity
and
its
malice
and
its
bitter
bitter
crewe
s
native
wit
and
rich
store
of
experience
availed
him
nothing
when
damerel
discoursed
thus
the
silvery
accents
flattered
his
ear
and
crept
into
the
soft
places
of
his
nature
he
felt
as
when
a
clever
actress
in
a
pathetic
part
wrought
upon
him
in
the
mood
you
must
bear
up
against
it
damerel
and
i
don
t
think
a
retired
life
would
suit
you
at
all
you
are
made
for
don
t
seek
for
compliments
i
am
speaking
quite
sincerely
ah
those
were
happy
days
that
i
spent
at
whitsand
tell
me
what
you
have
been
doing
is
there
any
hope
of
the
pier
yet
why
it
s
as
good
as
built
cried
the
other
didn
t
you
see
the
advertisements
when
we
floated
the
company
a
month
ago
i
suppose
you
don
t
read
that
kind
of
thing
we
shall
begin
at
the
works
in
early
look
here
he
unrolled
a
large
design
a
coloured
picture
of
whitsand
pier
as
it
already
existed
in
his
imagination
not
content
with
having
the
mere
structure
exhibited
crewe
had
persuaded
the
draughtsman
to
add
embellishments
of
a
kind
which
in
days
to
come
would
be
his
own
peculiar
care
from
end
to
end
the
pier
glowed
with
the
placards
of
advertisers
below
on
the
sands
appeared
and
these
also
were
covered
with
manifold
advertisements
nay
the
very
on
the
sunny
waves
declared
the
glory
of
somebody
s
soap
of
somebody
s
purgatives
i
ll
make
that
place
one
of
the
biggest
advertising
stations
in
england
see
if
i
don
t
you
remember
the
caves
i
m
going
to
have
them
lighted
with
electricity
and
painted
all
round
with
advertisements
of
the
most
artistic
what
a
brilliant
idea
there
s
something
else
you
might
like
to
hear
of
it
struck
me
i
would
write
a
guide
to
advertising
and
here
it
he
handed
a
copy
of
the
book
it
advertises
and
brings
a
little
grist
to
the
mill
on
its
own
account
three
weeks
since
i
got
it
out
and
we
ve
sold
three
thousand
of
it
costs
nothing
to
print
the
advertisements
more
than
pay
for
that
price
one
but
how
you
do
work
crewe
it
s
marvellous
and
yet
you
look
so
well
you
have
really
a
seaside
colour
i
never
ailed
much
since
i
can
remember
the
harder
i
work
the
better
i
i
too
have
always
been
rather
proud
of
my
her
eyes
dropped
but
then
i
have
led
a
life
of
idleness
couldn
t
you
make
me
useful
in
some
way
set
me
to
work
i
am
convinced
i
should
be
so
much
happier
let
me
help
you
crewe
i
write
a
pretty
fair
hand
don
t
i
crewe
smiled
at
her
made
a
sound
as
if
clearing
his
throat
grasped
his
knee
and
was
on
the
very
point
of
momentous
utterance
when
the
door
opened
turning
his
head
impatiently
he
saw
not
the
clerk
whose
duty
it
was
to
announce
people
but
a
lady
much
younger
than
damerel
and
more
fashionably
dressed
who
for
some
reason
had
preferred
to
announce
herself
why
do
you
come
in
like
that
crewe
demanded
staring
at
her
i
m
are
you
indeed
you
ought
to
send
in
your
name
they
said
you
had
a
lady
here
so
i
told
them
another
would
make
no
how
do
you
do
damerel
it
s
so
long
since
i
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
beatrice
french
stepped
forward
smiling
ominously
and
eyeing
first
crewe
then
his
companion
with
curiosity
of
the
frankest
impertinence
damerel
stood
up
we
will
speak
of
our
business
at
another
time
crewe
red
with
anger
turned
upon
beatrice
i
tell
you
i
am
engaged
to
damerel
asked
the
intruder
airily
you
might
suppose
he
addressed
the
elder
lady
that
this
woman
has
some
sort
of
hold
upon
me
i
m
sure
i
hope
not
said
damerel
for
your
own
nothing
of
the
kind
she
has
pestered
me
a
good
deal
and
it
began
in
this
beatrice
gave
him
so
fierce
a
look
that
his
tongue
faltered
before
you
tell
that
little
story
she
interposed
you
had
better
know
what
i
ve
come
about
it
s
a
queer
thing
that
damerel
should
be
here
happens
more
conveniently
than
things
generally
do
i
had
something
to
tell
you
about
her
you
may
know
it
but
most
likely
you
don
you
remember
she
faced
the
other
listener
when
i
came
to
see
you
a
long
time
ago
i
said
it
might
be
worth
while
to
find
out
who
you
really
were
i
haven
t
given
much
thought
to
you
since
then
but
i
ve
got
hold
of
what
i
wanted
as
i
knew
i
crewe
did
not
disguise
his
eagerness
to
hear
the
rest
damerel
stood
like
a
statue
of
british
respectability
deaf
and
blind
to
everything
that
conflicts
with
she
had
set
her
lips
in
the
smile
appropriate
to
one
who
is
braving
torture
do
you
know
who
she
is
or
not
beatrice
asked
of
crewe
he
shuffled
and
made
no
reply
fanny
has
just
told
me
in
a
letter
she
got
it
from
her
husband
our
friend
here
is
the
mother
of
horace
lord
and
of
nancy
she
ran
away
from
her
first
husband
and
was
divorced
whether
she
really
married
afterwards
i
don
t
quite
know
most
likely
not
at
all
events
she
has
run
through
her
money
and
wants
her
son
to
set
her
up
for
a
few
seconds
damerel
bore
the
astonished
gaze
of
her
admirer
then
her
expression
scarcely
changing
she
walked
steadily
to
the
door
and
vanished
the
silence
was
prolonged
till
broken
by
beatrice
s
laugh
has
she
been
bamboozling
you
old
man
i
didn
t
know
what
was
going
on
you
had
bad
luck
with
the
daughter
shouldn
t
wonder
if
the
mother
would
suit
you
better
all
said
and
crewe
seated
himself
and
gave
vent
to
his
feelings
in
a
phrase
of
pure
soliloquy
well
i
m
damned
i
cut
in
just
at
the
right
time
did
i
no
malice
i
ve
had
my
hit
back
at
her
and
that
s
as
the
man
of
business
remained
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
beatrice
took
a
chair
presently
he
looked
up
at
her
and
said
savagely
what
the
devil
do
you
want
then
take
it
and
but
beatrice
smiled
and
kept
her
seat
chapter
nancy
stood
before
her
husband
with
a
substantial
packet
in
brown
paper
it
was
after
breakfast
at
the
moment
of
their
parting
here
is
something
i
want
you
to
take
and
look
at
and
speak
about
the
next
time
you
ho
ho
i
don
t
like
the
look
of
he
felt
the
packet
several
quires
of
paper
be
off
or
you
ll
miss
the
poor
little
girl
he
kissed
her
affectionately
and
went
his
way
in
the
ordinary
course
of
things
nancy
would
not
have
seen
him
again
for
ten
days
or
a
fortnight
she
expected
a
letter
very
soon
but
on
the
fourth
evening
tarrant
s
fingers
tapped
at
the
in
his
hand
was
the
brown
paper
parcel
done
up
as
when
he
received
it
nancy
searched
his
face
her
own
perturbed
and
pallid
how
long
have
you
been
working
at
this
nearly
a
year
but
not
every
day
of
course
sometimes
for
a
week
or
more
i
could
get
no
time
you
think
it
bad
no
puff
not
in
any
sense
puff
bad
in
one
sense
it
s
good
but
puff
that
s
a
private
sense
a
domestic
the
question
is
dear
can
it
be
sold
to
a
the
question
is
nothing
of
the
kind
you
mustn
t
even
try
to
sell
it
to
a
why
not
you
mean
you
would
be
ashamed
if
it
came
out
but
i
shouldn
t
put
my
own
name
to
it
i
have
written
it
only
in
the
hope
of
making
money
and
so
helping
you
i
ll
put
any
name
to
it
you
tarrant
smoked
for
a
minute
or
two
until
his
companion
gave
a
sign
of
impatience
he
wore
a
very
look
it
s
more
than
likely
you
might
get
the
thing
accepted
oh
then
why
not
she
interrupted
eagerly
with
bright
eyes
because
it
isn
t
literature
but
a
little
bit
of
nancy
s
mind
and
heart
not
to
be
profaned
by
vulgar
handling
to
sell
it
for
hard
cash
would
be
horrible
leave
that
to
the
poor
creatures
who
have
no
choice
you
are
not
obliged
to
go
into
the
but
lionel
if
it
is
a
bit
of
my
mind
and
heart
it
must
be
a
good
book
you
have
often
praised
books
to
me
just
on
that
account
because
they
were
the
books
i
praised
were
literature
their
authors
came
into
the
world
to
write
it
isn
t
enough
to
be
genuine
there
must
be
workmanship
here
and
there
you
have
a
page
of
very
decent
english
and
you
are
nowhere
on
the
level
of
the
ordinary
female
novelist
indeed
don
t
take
it
ill
i
was
surprised
at
what
you
had
turned
out
but
he
finished
the
sentence
in
smoke
wreaths
then
i
ll
try
again
i
ll
do
never
better
it
will
never
be
what
does
that
matter
i
never
thought
myself
a
charlotte
bronte
or
a
george
eliot
but
so
many
women
make
money
out
of
novels
and
as
i
had
spare
time
i
didn
t
see
why
i
shouldn
t
use
it
profitably
we
want
money
and
if
it
isn
t
actually
disgraceful
and
if
i
don
t
use
my
own
name
we
don
t
want
money
so
badly
as
all
that
i
am
writing
because
i
must
do
something
to
live
by
and
i
know
of
nothing
else
open
to
me
except
whatever
trash
i
turned
out
i
should
be
justified
as
a
man
it
s
my
duty
to
join
in
the
for
more
or
less
dirty
ha
pence
you
as
a
woman
have
no
such
duty
nay
it
s
your
positive
duty
to
keep
out
of
the
beastly
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
something
why
should
a
woman
be
shut
out
from
the
life
of
the
world
it
seems
to
me
that
your
part
in
the
life
of
the
world
is
very
considerable
you
have
given
the
world
a
new
inhabitant
and
you
are
shaping
him
into
a
nancy
laughed
and
reflected
and
returned
to
her
discontent
oh
every
woman
can
do
not
one
woman
in
a
thousand
can
bear
a
child
and
not
one
in
fifty
thousand
can
bring
up
rightly
the
child
she
has
borne
leisure
you
must
have
but
for
heaven
s
sake
don
t
waste
it
read
enjoy
sit
down
to
the
feast
prepared
for
i
wanted
to
something
she
persisted
refusing
to
catch
his
eye
i
have
read
read
enough
ha
then
there
s
no
more
to
be
his
portentous
solemnity
overcame
her
laughter
lighted
her
face
and
tarrant
laying
down
his
pipe
shouted
extravagant
mirth
am
i
to
burn
it
then
you
are
not
you
are
to
seal
it
with
seven
seals
to
write
upon
it
de
and
to
lay
it
away
at
the
back
of
a
very
private
drawer
and
when
you
are
old
you
shall
some
day
bring
it
out
and
we
ll
put
our
shaky
heads
together
over
it
and
drop
a
tear
from
our
dim
old
nancy
will
you
go
with
me
to
a
night
a
yes
it
would
do
us
both
good
i
think
i
feel
fagged
and
you
want
a
here
s
the
end
of
march
please
heaven
another
month
shall
see
us
rambling
in
the
lanes
somewhere
meantime
we
ll
go
to
a
each
season
has
its
glory
if
we
can
t
hear
the
lark
let
us
listen
to
the
bellow
of
a
do
you
appreciate
this
invitation
it
means
that
i
enjoy
your
company
which
is
more
than
one
man
in
ten
thousand
can
say
of
his
wife
the
ordinary
man
when
he
wants
to
dissipate
asks
well
not
his
wife
and
i
in
plain
sober
truth
would
rather
have
nancy
with
me
than
anyone
you
say
that
to
comfort
me
after
my
i
say
it
because
i
think
the
day
after
i
want
you
to
come
over
in
the
morning
to
see
some
pictures
in
bond
street
and
the
next
day
we
ll
go
to
the
you
can
t
afford
mind
your
own
business
i
remembered
this
morning
that
i
was
young
and
that
i
shall
not
be
so
always
doesn
t
that
ever
come
upon
you
the
manuscript
fruit
of
such
persevering
toil
was
hidden
away
and
its
author
spoke
of
it
no
more
but
she
suffered
a
grave
disappointment
once
or
twice
a
temptation
flashed
across
her
mind
if
she
secretly
found
a
publisher
and
if
her
novel
achieved
moderate
success
she
might
alter
the
title
would
not
tarrant
forgive
her
for
acting
against
his
advice
it
was
nothing
more
than
advice
often
enough
he
had
told
her
that
he
claimed
no
coercive
right
that
their
union
if
it
were
to
endure
must
admit
a
genuine
independence
on
both
sides
but
herein
as
on
so
many
other
points
she
subdued
her
natural
impulse
and
conformed
to
her
husband
s
idea
of
wifehood
it
made
her
smile
to
think
how
little
she
preserved
of
that
same
genuine
independence
but
the
smile
had
no
bitterness
meanwhile
nothing
was
heard
of
horace
the
winter
passed
and
june
had
come
before
nancy
again
saw
her
brother
s
handwriting
it
was
on
an
ordinary
envelope
posted
as
she
saw
by
the
at
brighton
the
greater
her
surprise
to
read
a
few
lines
which
coldly
informed
her
that
horace
s
wife
no
longer
lived
she
took
cold
one
evening
a
fortnight
ago
and
died
after
three
days
nancy
tried
to
feel
glad
but
she
had
little
hope
of
any
benefit
to
her
brother
from
this
close
of
a
sordid
tragedy
she
answered
his
letter
and
begged
that
as
soon
as
he
felt
able
to
do
so
he
would
come
and
see
her
a
month
s
silence
on
horace
s
part
had
led
her
to
conclude
that
he
would
not
come
when
without
warning
he
presented
himself
at
her
door
it
was
morning
and
he
stayed
till
nightfall
but
talked
very
little
sitting
in
the
same
place
hour
after
hour
he
seemed
overcome
with
a
complete
exhaustion
which
made
speech
too
great
an
effort
and
kept
his
thoughts
straying
idly
fanny
s
name
did
not
pass
his
lips
when
nancy
ventured
an
inquiry
concerning
her
he
made
an
impatient
gesture
and
spoke
of
something
else
his
only
purpose
in
coming
it
appeared
was
to
ask
for
information
about
the
bahamas
i
can
t
get
rid
of
my
cough
and
i
m
afraid
it
may
turn
to
something
dangerous
you
said
i
remember
that
people
with
weak
chests
wintered
in
the
lionel
can
tell
you
all
about
it
he
ll
be
here
come
and
have
a
talk
with
he
moved
pettishly
tell
me
as
much
as
you
know
yourself
i
don
t
feel
well
enough
to
meet
looking
at
him
with
profound
compassion
nancy
thought
it
very
doubtful
whether
he
would
see
another
winter
but
she
told
him
all
she
could
remember
about
nassau
and
encouraged
him
to
look
forward
with
pleasure
and
hopefulness
to
a
voyage
thither
how
are
you
going
to
live
till
then
what
do
you
mean
he
answered
with
a
startled
and
irritated
look
i
m
not
so
bad
as
all
i
meant
how
are
you
going
to
arrange
your
life
nancy
hastened
to
explain
oh
i
have
comfortable
but
you
oughtn
t
to
be
quite
i
mean
it
must
be
so
she
made
a
proposal
that
he
should
have
a
room
in
this
little
house
and
use
it
as
a
home
whenever
he
chose
but
horace
so
fretted
under
the
suggestion
that
it
had
to
be
abandoned
his
behaviour
was
that
of
an
old
man
enfeebled
in
mind
and
body
once
or
twice
his
manner
of
speaking
painfully
reminded
nancy
of
her
father
during
the
last
days
of
his
life
with
a
peevish
sort
of
interest
he
watched
his
little
nephew
toddling
about
the
room
but
did
not
address
a
word
to
the
child
a
cab
was
sent
for
to
convey
him
to
the
railway
station
nancy
had
known
few
such
melancholy
days
as
this
on
the
morning
when
by
agreement
she
was
to
go
into
town
to
see
her
brother
there
arrived
a
note
from
him
he
had
been
advised
to
try
a
in
switzerland
and
was
already
on
the
way
sorry
he
could
not
let
nancy
know
before
would
visit
her
on
his
return
thus
in
the
style
of
telegraphy
as
though
he
wrote
in
hot
haste
from
switzerland
came
two
letters
much
more
satisfactory
in
tone
and
contents
the
first
written
in
july
announced
a
distinct
improvement
of
health
no
details
being
supplied
nancy
could
only
presume
that
her
brother
was
living
alone
at
the
hotel
from
which
he
dated
the
second
communication
a
month
later
began
thus
i
think
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
i
came
here
with
damerel
she
will
stay
till
the
end
of
the
summer
and
then
perhaps
go
with
me
to
the
bahamas
if
that
seems
necessary
but
i
am
getting
wonderfully
well
and
strong
damerel
is
kinder
to
me
than
any
one
in
the
world
ever
was
i
shall
tell
you
more
about
her
some
the
writer
went
on
to
describe
a
project
he
had
of
taking
a
small
farm
in
devonshire
and
living
upon
it
as
a
country
gentleman
tarrant
warned
his
wife
not
to
build
hopes
upon
this
surprising
report
and
a
few
weeks
brought
news
that
justified
him
horace
wrote
that
he
had
suffered
a
very
bad
attack
and
was
only
now
sufficiently
recovered
to
hold
a
pen
i
don
t
know
what
we
shall
do
but
i
am
in
good
hands
no
one
was
ever
better
nursed
night
and
day
more
before
indeed
it
was
not
long
a
day
or
two
after
nancy
s
return
from
a
seaside
holiday
mary
brought
in
a
telegram
it
came
from
damerel
your
brother
died
at
ten
o
clock
last
night
suddenly
and
without
pain
i
am
posting
a
letter
he
had
written
for
when
the
promised
letter
arrived
it
was
found
to
bear
a
date
two
months
ago
an
unwonted
tenderness
marked
the
opening
words
my
dearest
sister
what
i
am
going
to
write
is
not
to
be
sent
to
you
at
once
sometimes
i
feel
afraid
that
i
can
t
live
very
long
so
i
have
been
making
a
will
and
i
want
you
to
know
why
i
have
left
you
only
half
of
what
i
have
to
leave
the
other
half
will
go
to
some
one
who
has
an
equal
claim
on
me
though
you
don
t
know
it
she
has
asked
me
to
tell
you
if
i
get
thoroughly
well
again
there
will
be
no
need
of
this
letter
and
i
shall
tell
you
in
private
something
that
will
astonish
you
very
much
but
if
i
were
to
die
it
will
be
best
for
you
to
learn
in
this
way
that
damerel
is
much
more
to
us
than
our
mother
s
sister
she
is
our
own
mother
she
told
me
at
the
time
when
i
was
behaving
like
an
idiot
at
bournemouth
it
ought
to
have
been
enough
to
stop
me
she
confessed
that
she
had
done
wrong
when
you
and
i
were
little
children
that
was
how
she
came
to
marry
again
whilst
father
was
still
alive
though
it
seemed
impossible
i
have
come
to
love
her
for
her
great
kindness
to
me
i
know
that
i
could
trust
you
dearest
nancy
to
let
her
share
whatever
you
have
but
it
will
be
better
if
i
provide
for
her
in
my
will
she
has
been
living
on
a
small
capital
and
now
has
little
left
what
i
can
give
her
is
little
enough
but
it
will
save
her
from
the
worst
extremities
and
i
beg
you
dear
sister
to
forgive
her
fault
if
only
for
my
sake
because
she
has
been
so
loving
to
a
silly
and
useless
fellow
i
may
as
well
let
you
know
about
my
wife
s
death
she
was
consumptive
but
seemed
to
get
much
better
at
bournemouth
then
she
wanted
to
go
to
brighton
we
lived
there
at
a
boardinghouse
and
she
behaved
badly
very
badly
she
made
acquaintances
i
didn
t
like
and
went
about
with
them
in
spite
of
my
objections
like
an
obstinate
fool
i
had
refused
to
believe
what
people
told
me
about
her
and
now
i
found
it
all
out
for
myself
of
course
she
only
married
me
because
i
had
money
one
evening
she
made
up
her
mind
to
go
with
some
of
her
friends
in
a
boat
by
moonlight
we
quarrelled
about
it
but
she
went
all
the
same
the
result
was
that
she
got
inflammation
of
the
lungs
and
died
i
don
t
pretend
to
be
sorry
for
her
and
i
am
thankful
to
have
been
released
from
misery
so
much
sooner
than
i
deserved
and
now
let
me
tell
you
how
my
affairs
stand
at
the
first
reading
nancy
gave
but
slight
attention
to
this
concluding
paragraph
even
the
thought
of
her
brother
s
death
was
put
aside
by
the
emotions
with
which
she
learnt
that
her
mother
still
lived
after
brooding
over
the
intelligence
for
half
a
day
she
resolved
to
question
mary
who
perhaps
during
so
long
a
residence
in
grove
lane
had
learnt
something
of
the
trouble
that
darkened
her
master
s
life
the
conversation
led
to
a
disclosure
by
mary
of
all
that
had
been
confided
to
her
by
lord
the
time
had
come
for
a
fulfilment
of
her
promise
to
the
dead
man
chapter
horace
s
letter
nancy
sent
by
post
to
her
husband
requesting
him
to
let
her
know
his
thoughts
about
it
in
writing
before
they
again
met
of
her
own
feeling
she
gave
no
sign
i
want
you
to
speak
of
it
just
as
if
it
concerned
a
stranger
plainly
and
simply
all
i
need
say
is
that
i
never
even
suspected
the
tarrant
did
not
keep
her
long
in
suspense
and
his
answer
complied
in
reasonable
measure
with
the
desire
she
had
expressed
the
disclosure
has
of
course
pained
you
equally
of
course
you
wish
it
were
not
necessary
to
let
me
know
of
it
you
are
in
doubt
as
to
how
it
will
affect
me
you
perhaps
fear
that
i
shall
never
mind
about
phrasing
first
then
a
word
on
that
point
be
assured
once
for
all
that
nothing
external
to
yourself
can
ever
touch
the
feeling
which
i
now
have
for
you
one
word
is
too
often
profaned
i
will
say
simply
that
i
hold
you
in
higher
regard
that
any
other
human
being
try
not
to
grieve
my
dearest
it
is
an
old
story
in
both
senses
you
wish
to
know
how
i
view
the
matter
well
if
a
wife
can
not
love
her
husband
it
is
better
she
should
not
pretend
to
do
so
if
she
love
some
one
else
her
marriage
is
at
an
end
and
she
must
go
simple
enough
provided
there
be
no
children
whether
it
is
ever
permissible
for
a
mother
to
desert
her
children
i
don
t
know
i
will
only
say
that
in
you
yourself
i
can
find
nothing
more
admirable
than
the
perfect
love
which
you
devote
to
your
child
forsake
it
you
could
not
in
short
act
as
feeling
dictates
your
mother
lives
that
fact
can
not
be
ignored
in
your
attitude
towards
her
do
not
consult
me
at
all
whatever
your
heart
approves
i
shall
find
good
and
right
only
don
t
imagine
that
your
feeling
of
is
final
i
would
say
make
no
resolve
they
are
worth
little
in
any
concern
of
life
write
to
me
again
and
say
when
you
wish
to
see
me
after
reading
this
nancy
moved
about
with
the
radiance
of
a
great
joy
on
her
countenance
she
made
no
haste
to
reply
she
let
a
day
elapse
then
in
the
silence
of
a
late
hour
took
pen
and
paper
when
do
i
wish
to
see
you
always
in
every
moment
of
my
day
and
yet
i
have
so
far
conquered
the
unreasonable
female
do
you
remember
saying
that
that
i
would
rather
never
see
you
again
than
bring
you
to
my
side
except
when
it
was
your
pleasure
to
be
with
me
come
as
soon
as
you
can
as
soon
as
you
will
my
mother
how
shall
i
word
it
she
is
nothing
to
me
i
don
t
feel
that
nature
bids
me
love
her
i
could
pardon
her
for
leaving
my
father
like
you
i
see
nothing
terrible
in
that
but
like
you
i
that
she
did
wrong
in
abandoning
her
little
children
and
her
kindness
to
horace
at
the
end
can
not
atone
for
it
i
don
t
think
she
has
any
love
for
we
shall
not
see
each
other
at
all
events
that
is
how
i
feel
about
it
at
present
but
i
am
very
glad
that
horace
made
provision
for
her
that
of
course
was
right
if
he
had
not
done
it
it
would
have
been
my
duty
i
had
better
tell
you
that
mary
has
known
my
mother
s
story
for
a
long
time
but
not
that
she
still
lived
my
father
told
her
just
before
his
death
and
exacted
her
promise
that
if
it
seemed
well
she
would
repeat
everything
to
me
you
shall
know
more
about
it
though
it
is
bad
all
through
my
dear
father
had
reason
bitterly
to
regret
his
marriage
long
before
she
openly
broke
it
but
come
and
see
me
and
tell
me
what
is
to
be
done
now
that
we
are
free
to
look
round
there
is
no
shame
in
taking
what
poor
horace
has
given
us
you
see
that
there
will
be
at
least
three
thousand
pounds
for
our
share
apart
from
the
income
we
shall
have
from
the
he
was
sure
to
come
on
the
evening
of
the
morrow
nancy
went
out
before
breakfast
to
post
her
letter
in
the
assurance
that
her
husband
s
days
of
struggle
were
over
that
her
child
s
future
no
longer
depended
upon
the
bare
hope
that
its
father
would
live
and
thrive
by
a
profession
so
precarious
as
that
of
literature
she
gave
little
thought
to
the
details
of
the
new
phase
of
life
before
her
whatever
tarrant
proposed
would
be
good
in
her
sight
probably
he
would
wish
to
live
in
the
country
he
might
discover
the
picturesque
old
house
of
which
he
had
so
often
spoken
in
any
case
they
would
now
live
together
he
had
submitted
her
to
a
probation
and
his
last
letter
declared
that
he
was
satisfied
with
the
result
midway
in
the
morning
whilst
she
was
playing
with
her
little
boy
rain
kept
them
in
the
house
a
knock
at
the
front
door
announced
some
unfamiliar
visit
mary
came
to
the
parlour
with
a
face
of
surprise
who
is
it
miss
what
jessica
mary
handed
an
envelope
addressed
to
mrs
it
contained
a
sheet
of
paper
on
which
was
written
in
pencil
i
beg
you
to
see
me
if
only
for
a
yes
i
will
see
her
said
nancy
when
she
had
frowned
in
brief
reflection
mary
led
away
the
little
boy
and
a
moment
after
introduced
jessica
morgan
at
the
appearance
of
her
former
friend
nancy
with
difficulty
checked
an
exclamation
miss
morgan
wore
the
garb
of
the
salvation
army
harmonious
therewith
were
the
features
shadowed
by
the
hideous
bonnet
a
face
hardly
to
be
recognised
bloodless
all
but
fleshless
the
eyes
set
in
a
stare
of
fanaticism
she
came
hurriedly
forward
and
spoke
in
a
quick
whisper
i
was
afraid
you
would
refuse
to
see
why
have
you
come
i
was
impelled
i
had
a
duty
to
coldly
nancy
invited
her
to
sit
down
but
the
visitor
shook
her
head
i
mustn
t
take
a
seat
in
your
house
i
am
unwelcome
we
can
t
pretend
to
be
on
terms
of
friendliness
i
have
come
first
of
all
her
eyes
wandered
as
she
spoke
inspecting
the
room
to
humble
myself
before
you
to
confess
that
i
was
a
dishonourable
friend
to
make
known
with
my
lips
that
i
betrayed
your
secret
nancy
interrupted
the
low
hurrying
panting
voice
which
distressed
her
ear
as
much
as
the
facial
expression
that
accompanied
it
did
her
eyes
there
s
no
need
to
tell
me
i
knew
it
at
the
time
and
you
did
me
no
harm
indeed
it
was
a
she
drew
away
but
jessica
moved
after
her
i
supposed
you
knew
but
it
is
laid
upon
me
to
make
a
confession
before
you
i
have
to
ask
your
pardon
most
humbly
and
do
you
mean
that
some
one
has
told
you
to
do
this
oh
no
a
gleam
of
infinite
conceit
shot
over
the
humility
of
jessica
s
countenance
i
am
answerable
only
to
my
own
soul
in
the
pursuit
of
an
ideal
which
i
fear
you
can
not
understand
i
subdue
my
pride
and
confess
how
basely
i
behaved
to
you
will
you
grant
me
your
forgiveness
she
clasped
her
gloveless
hands
before
her
breast
and
the
fingers
writhed
together
if
it
is
any
satisfaction
to
you
replied
nancy
overcome
with
wonder
and
pity
i
will
say
those
words
but
don
t
think
that
i
take
upon
myself
only
say
them
i
ask
your
pardon
say
you
grant
nancy
uttered
the
formula
and
with
bowed
head
jessica
stood
for
a
minute
in
silence
her
lips
moved
and
now
she
said
at
length
i
must
fulfil
the
second
part
of
the
duty
which
has
brought
me
her
attitude
changed
to
one
of
authority
and
her
eyes
fixed
themselves
on
nancy
s
regarding
her
with
the
mild
but
severe
rebuke
of
a
spiritual
superior
having
acknowledged
my
i
must
remind
you
of
your
own
let
me
ask
you
first
of
all
have
you
any
religious
life
nancy
s
eyes
had
turned
away
but
at
these
words
they
flashed
sternly
upon
the
speaker
i
shall
let
you
ask
no
such
i
expected
it
jessica
sighed
patiently
you
are
still
in
the
darkness
out
of
which
have
been
if
you
have
nothing
more
to
say
than
this
i
must
refuse
to
talk
any
there
is
a
word
i
must
speak
pursued
jessica
if
you
will
not
heed
it
now
it
will
remain
in
your
memory
and
bear
fruit
at
the
appointed
time
i
alone
know
of
the
sin
which
poisons
your
soul
and
the
experiences
through
which
i
have
passed
justify
me
in
calling
you
to
nancy
raised
her
hand
stop
that
is
quite
enough
perhaps
you
are
behaving
conscientiously
i
will
try
to
believe
it
but
not
another
word
or
i
shall
speak
as
i
don
t
wish
it
is
enough
you
know
very
well
what
i
refer
to
don
t
imagine
that
because
you
are
now
a
married
woman
nancy
stepped
to
the
door
and
threw
it
open
leave
the
house
she
said
in
an
unsteady
tone
you
said
you
were
unwelcome
and
it
was
true
take
yourself
out
of
my
sight
jessica
put
her
head
back
murmured
some
inaudible
words
and
with
a
smile
of
rancorous
compassion
went
forth
into
the
rain
on
recovering
from
the
excitement
of
this
scene
nancy
regretted
her
severity
the
poor
girl
in
the
hideous
bonnet
had
fallen
very
low
and
her
state
of
mind
called
for
forbearance
the
treachery
for
which
jessica
sought
pardon
was
easy
to
forgive
not
so
however
the
impertinent
rebuke
which
struck
at
a
weak
place
in
nancy
s
conscience
just
when
the
course
of
time
and
favour
of
circumstances
seemed
to
have
completely
healed
that
old
wound
jessica
with
her
crazy
malice
grotesquely
disguised
came
to
revive
the
pangs
the
shame
and
the
doubt
that
had
seemed
to
be
things
gone
by
it
would
have
become
her
nancy
felt
to
treat
her
hapless
friend
of
years
ago
in
a
spirit
of
gentle
tolerance
that
she
could
not
do
so
proved
her
and
she
recognised
the
fact
still
immature
still
a
backward
pupil
in
the
school
of
and
in
the
jubilee
year
i
thought
myself
a
decidedly
accomplished
person
never
mind
her
husband
would
come
this
evening
of
him
she
could
learn
without
humiliation
his
arrival
was
later
than
of
wont
only
at
eleven
o
clock
when
with
disappointment
she
had
laid
aside
her
book
to
go
to
bed
did
tarrant
s
rap
sound
on
the
window
i
had
given
you
up
said
nancy
yet
you
are
quite
why
not
it
is
the
pleasant
custom
of
wives
to
make
a
husband
uncomfortable
if
he
comes
then
i
am
no
true
wife
laughed
nancy
something
much
better
tarrant
muttered
as
he
threw
off
his
overcoat
he
began
to
talk
of
ordinary
affairs
and
nearly
elapsed
before
any
mention
was
made
of
the
event
that
had
bettered
their
prospects
nancy
looked
over
a
piece
of
his
writing
in
an
evening
paper
which
he
had
brought
but
she
could
not
read
it
with
attention
the
paper
fell
to
her
lap
and
she
sat
silent
clearly
tarrant
would
not
be
the
first
to
speak
of
what
was
in
both
their
minds
the
clock
ticked
the
rain
pattered
without
the
journalist
smoked
his
pipe
and
looked
thoughtfully
at
the
ceiling
are
you
sorry
nancy
asked
that
i
am
no
longer
penniless
ah
to
be
sure
we
must
speak
of
that
no
i
m
not
sorry
if
i
get
run
over
you
and
the
boy
can
make
ourselves
comfortable
and
forget
you
to
be
sure
but
for
the
present
and
until
you
do
get
run
over
you
wish
to
make
changes
don
t
you
in
one
or
two
respects
perhaps
but
leave
me
out
of
the
question
you
have
an
income
of
your
own
to
dispose
of
nothing
oppressively
splendid
i
suppose
what
do
you
think
of
doing
what
do
you
advise
no
no
make
your
own
suggestion
nancy
smiled
hesitated
and
said
at
length
i
think
we
ought
to
take
a
in
london
that
s
as
you
not
at
all
as
wish
do
you
want
society
in
moderation
and
first
of
all
yours
tarrant
met
her
eyes
of
my
society
you
have
quite
as
much
as
is
good
for
you
he
answered
amiably
that
you
should
wish
for
acquaintances
is
reasonable
enough
take
a
house
somewhere
in
the
western
suburbs
one
or
two
men
i
know
have
decent
wives
and
you
shall
meet
but
you
you
won
t
live
with
me
you
know
my
view
of
that
nancy
kept
her
eyes
down
and
reflected
will
it
be
known
to
everybody
that
we
don
t
live
together
well
answered
tarrant
with
a
laugh
by
way
of
example
i
should
rather
like
it
to
be
known
but
as
i
know
wouldn
t
like
it
let
the
appearances
be
as
ordinary
as
you
again
nancy
reflected
she
had
a
struggle
with
herself
just
one
question
she
said
at
length
look
me
in
the
face
are
you
ever
so
little
ashamed
of
me
he
regarded
her
steadily
smiling
not
in
the
you
were
you
used
to
be
before
i
knew
you
and
before
i
knew
myself
when
in
fact
were
a
notable
young
lady
of
camberwell
and
he
paused
to
puff
at
his
pipe
and
you
a
notable
young
fool
of
nowhere
at
all
