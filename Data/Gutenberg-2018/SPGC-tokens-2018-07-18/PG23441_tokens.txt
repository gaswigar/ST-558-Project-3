found
myself
chatting
away
with

as
if
i
had
grown
up
with
them
facing
page
he
turned
around
quickly
glanced
up
and
caught
my
eyes
as
i
was
looking
down
quite
distressed
when
i
turned
to
speak
to
him
he
was
gone
and
i
was
immediately
surrounded
by
other
men
asking
me
for
dances
i
swept
past
him
with
my
nose
in
the
air
trying
to
look
like
mother
trowbridge
took
me
to
the
beehives
to
get
some
honey
and
show
me
what
a
queen
bee
is
like

smiled

apparent
effort
lady
betty
across
the
water
i
about
being
banished
i
do
know
yet
whether
i
pleased
or
not
but
i
do
know
that
excited
more
excited
than
i
ever
been
in
my
life
except
perhaps
when
miss
mackinstry
my
last
governess
had
hysterics
in
the
schoolroom
and
fainted
among
the
tea
things
i
suppose
i
sha
be
able
to
decide
about
the
state
of
my
feelings
until
i
had
more
of
them
on
the
same
subject
or
until
i
written
down
in
this
book
of
mine
everything
exactly
as
it
happened
i
like
doing
that
it
makes
things
seem
so
clear
when
you
try
to
review
them
afterwards
the
excitement
began
at
breakfast
by
mother
having
a
letter
that
she
liked
i
knew
she
liked
it
by
the
way
her
eyes
lighted
up
as
if
they
had
been
lamps
and
the
letter
a
match
all
the
other
letters
mostly
with
horrid
envelopes
which
had
been
making
her
quite
glowery
she
pushed
aside
mother
wo
have
a
crown
on
her
envelopes
she
thinks
it
vulgar
besides
putting
it
only
on
the
paper
saves
expense
this
envelope
had
a
great
sprawly
gold
crest
but
she
did
seem
to
disapprove
of
it
she
read
on
and
on
then
suddenly
glanced
up
as
if
she
would
have
said
something
quickly
to
victoria
she
did
say
it
though
for
she
remembered
me
i
am
never
taken
into
family
conclaves
because
i
not
out
yet
i
do
see
what
difference
that
makes
especially
as
i
not
to
be
allowed
to
come
out
till
after
vic
married
because
she
was
presented
four
years
ago
and
is
even
engaged
yet
so
for
all
i
can
tell
i
may
have
to
stay
in
till
i
a
hundred
or
leak
out
slowly
when
nobody
is
noticing
as
vic
says
girls
do
in
the
middle
classes
this
time
i
did
mind
however
for
i
could
see
how
the
letter
concerned
me
and
as
i
was
dying
for
a
sight
of
berengaria
puppies
which
were
born
last
night
i
was
glad
when
mother
told
me
not
to
fidget
after
i
finished
breakfast
but
to
run
down
to
the
kennels
if
i
liked
soon
i
forgot
all
about
the
letter
for
the
puppies
were
the
dearest
ducks
on
earth
can
puppies
be
ducks
i
wonder
and
besides
it
was
such
a
delicious
june
morning
that
i
could
have
danced
with
joy
because
i
was
alive
i
often
feel
like
that
but
there
nobody
to
tell
except
the
trees
and
the
dogs
and
my
poor
pony
who
is
almost
too
old
and
now
to
understand
she
was
my
brother
stanforth
pony
first
of
all
and
stanforth
is
then
she
was
vic
and
vic
is
but
mother
does
like
vic
age
to
be
mentioned
any
more
though
she
is
years
younger
than
stan
i
took
a
walk
in
the
park
and
afterwards
went
through
the
to
see
how
the
roses
were
getting
on
there
were
a
lot
of
petals
for
my
and
gathering
them
up
kept
me
for
some
time
then
as
the
jar
stands
in
vic
and
my
den
she
calls
it
her
den
but
it
has
to
be
part
mine
as
i
have
no
other
i
was
going
in
by
one
of
the
long
windows
when
i
heard
mother
voice
the
question
is
she
was
saying
what
to
be
done
with
betty
i
turned
round
and
ran
away
on
my
tiptoes
across
the
lawn
for
i
want
to
be
an
eavesdropper
and
it
would
be
nearly
as
bad
to
have
mother
know
i
had
heard
even
those
few
words
she
would
be
so
annoyed
and
mother
chills
me
all
the
way
through
to
my
bones
when
annoyed
it
is
wonderful
how
she
does
it
for
she
never
scolds
but
the
thermometer
simply
drops
to
and
you
feel
like
a
poor
little
shivering
crocus
that
has
come
up
too
soon
by
mistake
to
find
the
world
covered
with
snow
and
no
hope
of
squeezing
back
into
its
own
cosy
warm
bulb
again
i
stopped
out
of
doors
till
luncheon
and
played
croquet
against
myself
wishing
that
stan
would
run
down
for
although
stan
rather
fancies
himself
as
a
gorgeous
person
since
poor
father
death
gave
him
the
title
he
is
quite
nice
to
me
when
it
occurs
to
him
i
always
glad
when
he
comes
to
the
towers
but
he
hardly
ever
does
in
the
season
and
then
in
august
and
september
he
always
in
scotland
so
is
vic
for
the
matter
of
that
and
she
hates
being
in
the
country
in
may
and
june
though
surrey
is
so
close
to
town
that
luckily
she
miss
much
but
this
year
we
seem
to
have
been
horribly
poor
for
some
reason
vic
says
it
stan
fault
he
is
extravagant
i
suppose
however
as
everything
is
really
his
i
do
see
that
we
ought
to
complain
only
it
ca
be
pleasant
for
him
to
feel
that
mother
is
worrying
lest
he
should
marry
and
make
her
a
frumpy
dowager
before
we
two
girls
are
off
her
hands
at
luncheon
mother
mentioned
to
me
that
she
had
wired
to
ask
and
her
cousin
miss
sally
woodburn
down
for
dinner
and
to
stay
the
night
you
will
be
pleased
betty
as
you
like
miss
woodburn
so
much
she
said
i
like
her
but
i
do
like
and
i
do
know
how
to
pronounce
her
said
i
for
goodness
sake
do
call
her
ess
kay
to
her
face
again
cut
in
vic
i
did
mean
to
it
slipped
out
i
defended
myself
besides
it
was
you
who
nicknamed
her
that
is
a
very
charming
person
and
a
thorough
woman
of
the
world
mother
asserted
in
that
way
she
has
of
saying
the
word
which
you
had
better
leave
for
the
last
if
you
know
what
is
good
for
you
i
did
leave
it
for
the
last
so
far
as
was
concerned
but
inside
where
thank
goodness
even
her
eyes
ca
see
i
was
wondering
hard
when
mother
had
formed
that
flattering
opinion
a
fortnight
ago
i
heard
her
announce
that
americans
got
upon
her
nerves
and
she
hoped
she
would
not
soon
be
called
upon
to
meet
any
more
as
she
had
made
this
remark
directly
after
bidding
ess
kay
i
naturally
supposed
that
lady
to
be
the
immediate
cause
for
it
but
now
it
seemed
this
was
not
the
case
you
would
be
very
ungrateful
if
you
disliked
her
mother
went
on
as
she
took
such
a
tremendous
fancy
to
you
dear
me
i
did
know
that
i
exclaimed
opening
my
eyes
wide
i
thought
it
was
vic
she
you
are
her
favourite
as
you
are
with
miss
woodburn
also
said
mother
who
gets
the
effect
of
being
so
tremendously
dignified
partly
i
believe
from
never
clipping
her
words
as
the
rest
of
us
do
i
am
asking
them
down
again
especially
on
your
account
and
i
want
you
to
be
particularly
nice
to
them
it
easy
enough
to
be
nice
to
sally
woodburn
but
i
caught
a
look
from
vic
and
broke
off
my
sentence
hurrying
to
change
it
into
another
as
they
sailing
for
the
states
so
soon
i
have
time
to
spread
myself
much
do
be
slangy
betty
it
does
suit
you
said
mother
you
pick
up
too
many
things
from
stanforth
trust
him
not
to
drop
anything
worth
having
interpolated
vic
which
was
pert
but
mother
never
reproves
her
perhaps
and
miss
woodburn
wo
come
i
said
for
the
sake
of
getting
on
safer
ground
not
come
of
course
they
will
come
it
is
short
notice
but
if
they
have
other
engagements
they
will
break
them
returned
mother
and
though
it
would
be
as
impossible
for
her
to
be
vulgar
or
snobbish
as
it
would
for
a
tall
white
arum
lily
to
be
either
of
those
things
still
i
could
help
feeling
that
her
unconscious
thought
was
the
invitation
to
a
couple
of
unknown
touring
americans
from
the
duchess
of
stanforth
is
equivalent
to
my
receiving
a
royal
command
she
was
probably
right
anyhow
so
far
as
ess
kay
is
concerned
as
for
sally
woodburn
i
do
think
she
has
a
drop
of
snobbish
blood
in
her
veins
she
southern
not
south
american
as
i
was
stupid
enough
to
think
at
first
but
from
some
southern
state
or
other
kentucky
i
believe
it
is
she
short
and
plump
and
olive
and
smooth
as
ivory
satin
with
soft
lazy
brown
eyes
a
voice
like
rich
cream
a
smile
which
says
please
like
me
and
pretty
crinkly
dark
hair
that
is
beginning
to
glitter
with
silver
network
here
and
there
though
she
is
exactly
old
even
for
a
woman
perhaps
about
thirty
i
knew
that
miss
woodburn
rather
fancied
me
and
i
was
quite
pleased
to
take
her
up
to
her
room
when
she
and
her
elder
cousin
arrived
about
an
hour
before
dinner
i
stopped
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
left
her
with
her
maid
while
i
went
to
help
vic
and
get
myself
ready
only
one
maid
between
the
three
of
us
nowadays
which
means
unless
there
some
reason
why
vic
should
be
made
particularly
smart
that
mother
gets
more
than
a
third
of
thompson
services
that
as
it
should
be
of
course
and
we
do
grudge
it
but
vic
rather
helpless
and
i
always
have
to
hurry
to
see
her
through
this
evening
though
i
found
thompson
in
vic
room
next
to
mine
and
just
as
i
scientifically
dislocated
my
arms
to
unhook
my
frock
which
does
up
behind
mother
came
in
betty
she
said
quite
playfully
for
her
i
have
a
very
pleasant
surprise
for
you
you
would
never
be
able
to
guess
so
i
will
tell
you
i
have
consented
to
let
you
go
and
visit
and
miss
woodburn
in
america
are
you
delighted
i
felt
as
if
the
wall
of
the
house
were
tumbling
down
and
i
would
presently
be
crumpled
up
underneath
my
goodness
gracious
mother
i
managed
to
stammer
forgetting
how
i
always
stood
in
awe
of
her
since
i
could
toddle
how
how
perfectly
extraordinary
am
i
going
and
is
it
all
decided
whether
i
like
or
not
of
course
you
will
like
to
travel
with
pleasant
companions
and
see
a
great
new
country
under
such
charming
auspices
is
an
immense
privilege
a
very
unusual
privilege
for
a
young
girl
mother
replied
promptly
as
for
the
you
are
going
because
you
have
been
cordially
invited
because
i
think
the
experience
will
be
for
your
advantage
present
and
future
because
also
it
will
be
good
for
a
growing
girl
like
you
to
have
the
bracing
effect
of
a
sea
voyage
mother
i
have
a
thing
the
matter
with
me
and
i
have
grown
the
eighth
of
an
inch
this
whole
last
year
you
can
see
by
my
frocks
i
protested
more
on
principle
than
because
it
would
be
any
use
to
protest
or
because
i
was
sure
that
i
wanted
mother
to
change
her
mind
naturally
the
protest
had
no
effect
but
mother
mood
mercifully
remained
placid
and
she
did
give
me
a
single
freezing
look
is
a
woman
of
good
family
and
position
in
her
own
country
she
went
calmly
on
i
have
satisfied
myself
on
those
points
beyond
doubt
or
i
should
not
dream
of
allowing
you
to
be
her
guest
she
has
a
cottage
at
newport
and
will
take
you
there
as
summer
it
seems
is
not
the
season
in
new
york
you
may
stay
with
her
through
july
and
august
even
for
september
if
you
are
amusing
yourself
later
will
send
you
home
with
friends
of
hers
who
can
be
trusted
to
take
good
care
of
you
she
knows
several
people
she
tells
me
who
are
crossing
in
the
autumn
to
winter
abroad
and
they
would
bring
you
to
me
of
course
i
should
have
to
be
nice
to
them
by
way
of
showing
my
appreciation
of
any
trouble
you
had
given
but
a
dinner
and
a
saturday
to
monday
at
most
would
be
quite
enough
so
it
was
all
arranged
even
to
the
details
of
my
and
the
price
to
be
paid
for
returning
me
like
a
parcel
to
my
owner
suddenly
i
remembered
the
words
i
had
overheard
at
the
window
of
the
den
the
question
is
what
is
to
be
done
with
betty
mother
had
evidently
been
so
anxious
to
have
the
question
answered
that
she
had
at
once
taken
measures
to
settle
it
but
why
should
anything
be
done
with
me
nothing
ever
had
been
so
far
except
when
i
was
sent
last
autumn
to
stop
with
my
aunt
and
she
was
so
much
annoyed
because
my
cousin
loveland
came
home
unexpectedly
that
after
that
i
could
do
nothing
to
please
her
and
was
packed
back
to
battlemead
towers
in
disgrace
i
never
could
understand
for
what
crime
how
did
ess
i
mean
happen
to
ask
for
a
visit
from
me
i
ventured
to
wriggle
out
like
a
worm
who
is
sure
whether
it
had
better
turn
or
not
i
was
certain
that
for
some
reason
of
her
own
mother
had
suggested
the
idea
if
only
hypnotically
but
she
seemed
almost
too
frank
as
she
answered
and
it
was
frightening
not
even
to
be
snubbed
i
told
you
that
she
had
taken
a
fancy
to
you
my
dear
of
course
she
could
not
hope
to
secure
victoria
even
if
she
preferred
her
for
victoria
has
important
engagements
which
will
carry
her
through
the
season
and
afterwards
to
cowes
and
up
to
scotland
for
the
shooting
at
dorloch
castle
but
you
are
still
almost
a
child
and
children
do
not
have
engagements
nevertheless
you
are
lady
betty
bulkeley
the
duke
of
stanforth
sister
and
as
such
though
in
yourself
you
are
an
unimportant
little
person
it
not
impossible
that
as
a
member
of
your
family
these
americans
may
think
you
worth
cultivating
one
hears
that
they
worship
titles
i
sure
they
ca
worship
them
as
much
as
some
people
in
our
own
country
who
have
got
them
do
i
cried
defending
americans
for
miss
woodburn
sake
vic
says
never
mind
what
victoria
says
returned
mother
the
less
you
think
on
these
subjects
the
better
my
dear
betty
i
merely
hinted
at
a
possible
and
partial
incentive
to
these
people
friendship
for
you
so
that
you
need
not
feel
it
incumbent
to
be
oppressively
grateful
you
know
i
should
wish
you
to
keep
your
dignity
among
foreigners
even
though
you
would
of
course
look
upon
as
in
a
way
your
guardian
now
i
must
call
thompson
and
have
her
put
me
into
my
dinner
dress
as
there
is
no
more
time
to
waste
when
speaks
of
your
visit
you
will
know
what
to
say
i
mumbled
something
vaguely
dutiful
and
began
to
dress
as
quickly
as
i
could
but
the
more
i
thought
of
it
the
more
i
felt
that
i
had
been
fairly
treated
to
be
disposed
of
in
such
an
offhand
way
after
all
i
eighteen
and
a
person
of
eighteen
is
a
child
i
not
sure
i
was
pouting
when
vic
came
in
ready
for
dinner
asking
if
she
should
fasten
up
my
frock
i
had
nearly
finished
it
for
practice
has
made
me
almost
as
clever
as
a
conjurer
about
manipulating
my
hands
behind
my
back
but
when
vic
flew
at
me
and
began
giving
useless
little
touches
i
guessed
that
she
wanted
to
whisper
something
in
my
ear
without
mother
seeing
if
she
should
happen
to
prance
in
at
the
wrong
moment
as
she
often
does
look
here
betty
are
you
going
to
be
a
good
little
girl
and
do
what
you
bid
without
making
a
fuss
she
asked
in
a
quick
low
voice
i
not
certain
yet
said
i
i
thinking
it
over
i
do
see
why
i
should
be
sent
off
across
the
water
with
strangers
at
a
notice
and
i
is
a
moment
notice
it
five
days
they
not
sailing
till
wednesday
and
as
they
a
suite
engaged
the
best
on
the
ship
ess
kay
says
your
going
wo
put
them
out
a
bit
and
they
having
you
as
for
the
whys
and
wherefores
mother
been
telling
you
has
she
she
talked
about
my
health
and
valuable
experiences
and
a
lot
of
things
in
the
air
but
i
feel
there
something
behind
it
and
i
hate
mysteries
if
i
can
convince
you
it
for
the
good
of
the
family
in
general
if
not
yours
in
particular
will
you
be
a
nice
white
woolly
lamb
and
go
with
your
kind
little
american
friends
vic
broke
in
with
her
head
on
my
shoulder
and
an
arm
slipped
round
my
waist
ess
kay
neither
little
nor
kind
said
i
but
of
course
do
anything
to
help
if
only
i
treated
like
a
rational
human
being
and
so
you
shall
be
i
told
mother
it
would
be
much
better
to
be
frank
with
you
if
you
a
baby
it
too
late
to
explain
things
now
but
if
you
be
sweet
to
ess
kay
and
agree
with
everything
everybody
says
about
your
trip
when
we
come
up
to
bed
and
mother
door
shut
i
make
a
clean
breast
and
show
you
how
matters
stand
with
this
we
separated
for
we
could
hear
ess
kay
voice
in
the
corridor
talking
to
sally
woodburn
on
the
way
downstairs
her
voice
is
never
difficult
to
hear
rather
the
other
way
and
miss
woodburn
soft
little
drawl
following
it
reminded
me
of
a
spoonful
of
devonshire
cream
after
a
bunch
of
currants
mother
was
with
them
both
in
the
oak
when
vic
and
i
got
down
and
i
found
myself
staring
at
ess
kay
with
a
new
kind
of
criticism
in
my
mind
indeed
it
had
occurred
to
me
before
to
criticise
at
all
i
only
felt
that
i
did
want
to
come
any
closer
to
her
now
i
was
to
come
much
closer
it
seemed
and
i
looked
at
the
glittering
lady
wondering
how
it
would
feel
to
be
so
close
wondering
what
herself
was
outside
she
more
like
the
biggest
and
most
splendid
model
ever
made
for
a
paris
than
anything
else
i
can
think
of
at
least
she
is
like
that
from
under
her
chin
down
to
the
tips
of
her
toes
i
say
under
her
chin
for
that
feature
as
well
as
all
the
others
above
it
are
miles
removed
from
a
pretty
wax
lady
in
a
i
never
supposed
till
i
met
that
a
live
woman
could
have
a
figure
exactly
like
the
swelling
like
a
tidal
wave
above
an
hourglass
of
a
waist
and
retreating
far
far
into
the
dim
perspective
below
it
then
suddenly
bulging
out
behind
like
a
round
magnificent
knoll
after
a
deep
curve
inward
under
the
shoulders
but
figure
does
all
these
things
even
when
she
stands
still
and
a
great
many
more
when
she
walks
which
act
she
accomplishes
in
a
grand
sweepy
kind
of
a
way
with
her
head
a
little
thrown
back
as
if
she
wants
everybody
to
know
that
she
is
tremendously
important
in
the
scheme
not
only
of
the
world
but
of
the
universe
yet
in
spite
of
all
in
the
end
it
her
face
which
impresses
you
even
more
than
her
figure
which
is
a
real
triumph
as
the
figure
is
so
elaborate
and
successful
on
top
of
her
head
is
a
quite
little
coil
of
hair
that
lifts
itself
and
spirals
up
like
a
giant
a
dagger
keeps
it
in
place
and
looks
as
if
the
point
plunged
into
ess
kay
brain
though
i
suppose
it
does
over
the
forehead
is
a
noble
roll
which
has
the
effect
of
a
breaker
just
about
to
fall
into
surf
but
never
falling
it
a
black
breaker
and
the
straight
thick
eyebrows
an
inch
below
it
are
black
too
so
are
the
short
eyelashes
also
thick
and
straight
like
a
stiff
fringe
but
the
eyes
are
grey
grey
as
glass
though
not
transparent
sometimes
they
seem
almost
white
with
just
a
tiny
bead
of
black
for
the
pupil
i
never
saw
anything
so
hard
except
the
glass
marbles
i
used
to
play
with
and
they
look
at
most
people
as
if
something
behind
them
were
doing
a
mental
sum
in
arithmetic
for
the
something
own
advantage
they
look
at
mother
in
that
way
no
eyes
in
the
world
would
dare
but
talking
about
ordinary
people
who
are
not
tall
white
arum
lilies
with
the
air
of
having
grown
in
kings
gardens
nose
is
and
rather
large
so
is
her
mouth
with
a
thin
red
line
of
lips
but
somehow
it
the
chin
the
feature
you
simply
take
for
granted
and
hardly
remember
on
most
faces
which
dominates
the
rest
it
comes
rounding
out
under
her
lips
making
them
seem
to
recede
though
they
do
really
and
it
square
with
an
effect
of
the
skin
being
laid
on
over
some
perfectly
hard
material
like
marble
or
the
same
ivory
her
teeth
are
made
of
besides
all
this
as
if
it
were
enough
she
a
widow
one
of
those
women
who
look
as
if
they
had
been
born
widows
anyway
i
certain
that
can
never
have
been
a
child
sally
woodburn
chin
is
rather
full
too
i
wonder
if
in
spite
of
her
lazy
ways
and
slow
soft
speech
she
is
very
decided
like
her
cousin
who
is
so
much
older
and
bigger
and
apparently
able
to
make
the
gentle
little
southern
relative
do
as
she
wills
ess
kay
terribly
glittering
this
evening
in
a
gown
contrasting
strongly
with
our
simple
things
was
almost
too
nice
to
me
saying
several
times
over
how
glad
she
was
that
i
was
going
to
visit
her
at
dinner
she
painted
of
the
good
times
she
would
give
me
and
though
i
never
been
able
to
care
for
her
and
do
a
bit
more
now
i
began
to
be
rather
excited
by
her
talk
for
she
made
things
seem
so
interesting
and
new
besides
it
appears
that
sally
woodburn
will
be
at
newport
most
of
the
summer
so
i
shall
have
her
to
fall
back
upon
as
for
me
i
was
good
as
gold
and
vic
threw
me
approving
glances
for
which
i
was
grateful
for
i
like
being
in
vic
good
graces
she
does
often
bother
with
me
much
but
when
she
does
she
is
so
sweet
it
makes
up
for
everything
and
she
knows
that
well
i
could
hardly
wait
to
hear
her
explanations
and
so
i
was
glad
ess
kay
and
miss
woodburn
were
hypnotised
by
mother
into
thinking
they
wanted
to
go
early
to
bed
mother
is
very
clever
about
such
things
she
did
come
again
to
talk
to
me
in
my
room
i
suppose
she
thought
it
best
to
let
the
new
ideas
simmer
anyhow
she
sent
thompson
away
and
shut
the
door
between
vic
room
and
hers
sooner
than
usual
presently
vic
slipped
quietly
in
to
me
in
the
new
blue
which
was
to
have
been
mine
only
when
she
saw
it
finished
she
wanted
it
and
had
four
inches
taken
up
above
the
hem
well
how
are
you
feeling
about
things
now
she
asked
sitting
down
in
front
of
the
mirror
with
her
hairbrush
in
her
hand
i
tell
you
after
you
told
me
why
i
ought
to
feel
one
way
more
than
another
i
said
with
prudent
reserve
then
like
a
good
child
brush
my
hair
i
would
let
thompson
do
anything
because
i
knew
you
be
dying
to
have
me
and
i
can
talk
so
beautifully
while
my
hair
is
being
done
it
makes
me
wish
i
were
a
pussy
cat
so
that
i
could
purr
i
hate
having
mine
touched
by
anyone
said
i
well
perhaps
i
should
hate
it
too
if
mine
were
curly
and
about
six
inches
thick
and
came
down
to
my
knees
i
should
be
afraid
of
being
pulled
to
pieces
there
that
heavenly
well
now
i
can
begin
you
know
baby
this
is
a
new
idea
about
your
going
to
america
ess
kay
say
something
on
the
subject
when
she
was
staying
here
before
oh
yes
when
she
was
going
away
she
said
how
much
she
would
like
to
have
either
of
us
visit
her
is
that
all
it
something
is
it
enough
to
make
a
handle
of
when
a
needed
but
why
is
a
handle
needed
i
going
to
tell
you
the
whole
truth
and
nothing
but
the
truth
mother
had
a
letter
from
sir
gilbert
mantell
this
morning
oh
that
big
splashy
crest
was
his
then
it
like
him
now
i
come
to
think
of
it
nobody
but
a
knight
with
piles
and
piles
of
money
would
need
one
more
than
half
the
size
do
sneer
at
his
money
my
good
child
we
want
it
badly
enough
in
this
family
not
his
yes
we
do
and
i
see
a
reasonable
prospect
of
our
getting
it
if
you
go
to
the
states
with
ess
kay
what
can
that
have
to
do
with
it
i
do
know
one
bit
what
you
mean
that
because
you
such
a
great
baby
if
you
have
every
t
crossed
and
every
i
dotted
sir
gilbert
has
apparently
conceived
a
patronising
toleration
for
your
victoria
which
is
likely
if
properly
fostered
and
encouraged
to
develop
into
something
more
satisfactory
patronising
indeed
that
dull
elephant
elephants
are
not
as
a
rule
dull
and
forty
thousand
a
year
in
any
form
can
afford
to
patronise
a
daughter
of
a
hundred
dukes
without
a
penny
whereas
i
merely
the
granddaughter
of
three
in
fact
my
dear
i
humbly
anxious
that
sir
gilbert
should
propose
and
as
he
been
rather
nice
and
as
he
written
almost
asking
for
an
invitation
to
come
down
with
stan
from
next
saturday
to
monday
although
he
carefully
states
he
been
invited
for
the
same
time
by
princess
paul
of
plon
things
look
hopeful
the
only
trouble
is
you
me
yes
you
the
one
time
he
ever
saw
you
was
when
you
had
that
frightful
cold
and
looked
hideous
with
your
poor
dear
nose
twice
its
size
and
your
eyes
half
theirs
but
well
betty
you
a
beauty
and
i
not
though
i
do
flatter
myself
i
not
bad
looking
i
plain
and
you
coloured
and
the
mantell
man
can
afford
tuppence
for
a
wife
you
are
so
frightfully
luridly
pretty
that
almost
improper
and
if
he
comes
down
and
sees
you
he
probably
think
you
better
worth
his
money
than
i
am
what
nonsense
and
if
he
were
such
an
idiot
of
course
i
should
refuse
him
you
would
that
one
of
mother
difficulties
even
you
must
see
that
would
do
no
good
from
the
family
point
of
view
i
could
keep
out
of
the
creature
way
you
could
without
stan
making
some
blundering
remark
or
some
happening
it
would
be
sure
to
it
much
safer
to
have
you
absolutely
out
of
the
way
and
it
was
when
we
were
talking
it
over
this
morning
that
mother
hit
upon
the
plan
of
sending
you
to
the
states
you
know
how
prompt
she
is
once
she
made
up
her
mind
mother
is
really
a
wonderful
woman
twenty
minutes
later
she
sent
a
telegram
to
ess
kay
asking
her
to
come
down
and
certain
under
providence
that
she
would
for
an
intimate
sort
of
invitation
like
this
when
we
alone
especially
after
the
great
disappointment
would
be
too
flattering
to
a
woman
of
that
type
not
to
be
snapped
at
no
matter
if
a
dozen
engagements
had
to
be
trampled
in
the
dust
what
great
disappointment
are
you
talking
about
infant
in
arms
why
stan
and
miss
woodburn
i
did
know
nobody
told
me
fancy
needing
to
be
told
as
if
that
were
the
only
reason
why
mother
smiled
on
ess
kay
in
the
beginning
it
was
because
she
thought
miss
woodburn
might
do
for
stanforth
who
marry
money
and
is
too
poor
horribly
poor
to
be
much
of
a
catch
with
most
english
heiresses
who
are
as
keen
on
titles
as
they
used
to
be
unless
there
some
solid
foundation
for
them
to
stand
on
and
not
wobble
everyone
says
miss
woodburn
a
great
heiress
and
though
she
a
few
years
older
than
stan
she
a
lady
a
charming
creature
and
not
bad
looking
mother
thought
all
that
out
the
day
they
were
introduced
to
her
at
the
northminster
concert
so
she
invited
them
here
but
stan
and
the
woodburn
would
at
each
other
it
was
useless
even
for
mother
genius
to
attempt
the
impossible
so
she
resigned
herself
to
the
inevitable
and
gave
the
thing
up
she
meant
to
drop
the
americans
gently
which
she
could
easily
do
as
they
were
going
home
soon
when
this
new
idea
popped
up
it
really
important
for
me
dear
i
do
want
you
to
see
that
it
will
be
so
much
better
all
around
if
you
are
out
of
the
way
anyhow
until
i
safely
engaged
and
the
fixed
then
you
know
if
you
have
meanwhile
picked
up
an
american
millionaire
on
the
other
side
do
look
so
horrified
mother
will
be
able
to
devote
herself
to
you
heart
and
soul
as
she
has
to
me
next
spring
you
can
be
presented
do
bribe
i
said
feeling
as
if
i
wanted
to
cry
if
you
want
to
get
rid
of
me
i
go
without
that
but
i
should
have
thought
i
might
be
sent
again
to
aunt
sophy
not
again
till
our
magnificent
cousin
safely
married
she
have
you
there
remember
how
she
sent
you
home
last
time
poor
loveland
he
too
must
think
about
collecting
honest
gold
somebody
else
to
brighten
up
his
coronet
we
a
lot
my
child
and
it
for
me
with
your
help
to
retrieve
the
fallen
fortunes
of
this
branch
of
the
family
that
settled
then
said
i
as
drily
as
i
could
with
wet
tears
in
the
background
and
now
let
go
to
bed
please
i
sleepy
i
was
but
my
eyes
were
hot
and
there
was
a
lump
in
my
throat
i
was
homesick
dreadfully
homesick
for
something
i
do
know
what
but
it
seemed
to
be
something
i
never
had
yet
and
probably
never
can
have
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
be
alone
and
write
everything
down
exactly
as
it
has
happened
ii
about
crossing
the
water
only
ten
days
have
passed
but
i
feel
as
if
they
were
a
hundred
i
have
lived
so
much
i
heard
people
near
me
in
saying
that
it
been
a
dull
voyage
but
whatever
else
it
has
been
for
it
has
been
dull
in
the
first
place
i
never
been
on
the
sea
before
except
crossing
the
channel
which
does
count
of
course
and
now
that
i
been
thrown
with
so
many
people
all
sorts
of
people
i
realise
how
few
i
have
known
in
my
life
so
far
if
i
had
about
twice
as
many
fingers
and
toes
as
i
have
i
believe
i
might
tick
off
every
human
being
i
ever
met
as
actual
acquaintances
outside
my
own
relations
i
lived
always
at
dear
beautiful
old
battlemead
it
seems
doubly
beautiful
as
i
think
of
it
now
from
far
away
and
till
last
year
most
of
my
time
was
spent
in
the
schoolroom
or
walking
or
pottering
about
in
a
pony
carriage
with
one
of
the
governesses
i
used
to
drive
to
distraction
when
we
had
house
parties
i
was
kept
out
of
the
way
as
mother
said
it
spoiled
young
girls
to
be
taken
notice
of
and
i
should
have
my
fun
later
when
the
others
went
up
to
town
for
the
season
as
they
often
did
i
was
left
behind
and
though
battlemead
is
within
miles
of
london
i
suppose
i
have
been
there
more
than
two
dozen
times
in
my
life
when
i
did
go
it
was
generally
for
a
concert
or
a
matinée
and
of
course
i
enjoyed
it
immensely
but
i
do
know
that
it
taught
me
much
about
life
and
the
one
time
i
was
taken
abroad
we
had
nothing
to
do
with
anyone
we
met
at
hotels
being
on
this
big
ship
seemed
at
first
exactly
like
being
at
a
play
when
i
had
been
brought
in
late
and
found
it
difficult
to
know
which
were
the
leading
actors
which
the
villains
and
villainesses
and
what
the
plot
was
about
now
though
i
been
through
so
many
experiences
i
feel
as
if
i
were
the
play
myself
not
watching
it
from
outside
everything
was
very
nice
though
very
strange
to
begin
with
dear
old
stan
came
out
of
his
shell
and
actually
travelled
all
the
way
to
southampton
to
see
me
off
which
was
good
of
him
especially
as
vic
explained
that
he
and
sally
woodburn
had
been
thrown
at
each
heads
in
vain
he
brought
me
a
great
box
of
sweets
a
bunch
of
roses
and
several
magazines
and
just
as
we
were
starting
he
slipped
something
small
but
fat
into
my
hand
that
to
help
you
keep
your
end
up
kid
in
case
you
imposed
on
said
he
you
only
a
kid
you
know
but
all
the
same
do
let
them
treat
you
like
one
and
if
you
get
the
hump
over
there
just
you
cable
me
i
see
you
through
and
have
you
back
again
with
your
own
sort
mater
or
no
mater
hanged
if
i
do
stan
never
made
me
such
a
long
speech
before
and
after
we
sailed
and
i
got
time
to
look
at
the
fat
thing
he
put
in
my
hand
i
found
it
was
a
lot
of
goldpieces
bundled
up
in
two
notes
the
gold
made
twelve
sovereigns
more
so
stan
had
given
me
altogether
more
than
thirty
pounds
all
that
money
with
the
twenty
pounds
mother
had
told
me
to
use
only
when
strictly
necessary
made
me
feel
a
regular
millionaire
i
never
had
a
sixth
part
as
much
before
in
my
life
stan
kindness
was
just
like
a
cup
of
something
warm
and
comforting
when
you
tired
and
cold
so
that
i
began
to
brighten
up
and
feel
happy
i
liked
our
suite
with
two
staterooms
a
bath
and
a
dear
little
about
as
big
as
the
old
dolls
house
i
inherited
from
vic
i
was
thankful
to
find
i
was
to
chum
with
miss
woodburn
not
ess
kay
for
i
could
have
stood
that
it
was
fun
finding
places
to
hang
up
our
things
when
they
were
unpacked
and
ess
kay
french
maid
louise
helped
me
get
settled
paying
me
so
many
compliments
on
my
hair
and
my
eyes
and
my
complexion
that
i
grew
quite
confused
but
perhaps
that
a
habit
in
which
american
ladies
encourage
their
maids
but
the
marvel
that
is
miladi
hair
it
is
of
the
colour
of
gold
and
with
a
natural
curl
it
will
be
so
great
a
joy
if
i
may
dress
it
and
her
complexion
it
is
beyond
that
of
any
english
demoiselle
i
have
seen
yet
all
the
world
knows
they
are
the
best
on
earth
with
such
eyes
no
doubt
miladi
can
wear
any
colour
and
she
has
the
figure
for
which
the
make
of
corsets
is
of
no
import
if
it
had
been
in
english
i
should
have
wanted
to
order
her
out
of
the
room
but
things
like
that
do
sound
so
objectionable
in
french
miss
woodburn
and
especially
ess
kay
clothes
looked
so
exquisite
that
i
was
mortified
to
have
louise
unpack
mine
though
i
have
brought
my
smartest
things
and
vic
had
two
or
three
pretty
blouses
of
hers
altered
in
a
great
hurry
for
me
besides
mother
said
my
outfit
was
quite
good
enough
for
a
young
girl
in
england
and
that
i
was
not
to
let
myself
feel
dissatisfied
if
in
another
country
they
chose
to
overdress
anyhow
i
will
say
for
ess
kay
that
she
did
appear
to
be
ashamed
of
me
at
first
on
the
contrary
she
had
a
way
of
seeming
to
show
me
off
almost
as
if
she
thought
i
did
her
credit
when
we
had
unpacked
we
three
went
to
luncheon
and
took
the
first
seats
which
were
vacant
but
presently
ess
kay
sent
for
the
chief
steward
or
someone
important
i
am
said
she
in
a
haughty
voice
and
i
have
as
my
guest
lady
betty
bulkeley
daughter
of
the
duchess
of
stanforth
you
must
give
me
three
of
the
best
seats
at
the
captain
table
i
could
help
hearing
and
my
ears
did
tingle
but
miss
woodburn
only
smiled
and
looked
down
with
a
funny
twinkle
under
her
eyelashes
which
curl
up
so
much
that
it
always
seems
as
if
she
were
just
going
to
laugh
i
thought
if
i
were
the
steward
i
would
give
us
the
worst
seats
on
the
ship
to
teach
us
not
to
be
proud
but
he
did
do
anything
of
the
sort
he
was
as
meek
as
a
lamb
so
i
sure
he
ca
have
any
sense
of
humour
he
said
might
count
on
him
and
she
and
her
party
should
have
places
on
the
captain
right
hand
ess
kay
was
as
bad
with
the
deck
steward
she
found
that
he
put
our
chairs
which
she
had
brought
on
board
herself
in
the
right
place
and
she
had
him
called
up
and
made
a
great
fuss
the
cards
of
a
reverend
somebody
his
wife
and
daughters
were
on
chairs
in
the
position
which
she
had
made
up
her
mind
to
have
exactly
amidship
and
on
the
shady
side
i
must
have
my
chairs
changed
and
put
here
she
said
and
then
oh
horror
i
certain
i
caught
her
repeating
the
formula
she
used
at
luncheon
i
am
and
i
have
as
my
guest
etc
etc
to
be
sure
she
had
walked
off
to
a
little
distance
with
the
where
our
chairs
were
and
i
might
have
been
mistaken
but
two
or
three
people
who
were
standing
near
looked
suddenly
very
hard
at
me
and
i
know
i
turned
scarlet
with
annoyance
to
be
labelled
in
that
way
as
if
i
were
a
parcel
marked
glass
and
to
be
handled
with
care
afterwards
when
i
came
to
read
the
i
found
that
there
was
nobody
else
on
board
with
any
sort
of
title
not
even
an
honourable
anybody
otherwise
of
course
ess
kay
little
manoeuvre
which
i
afraid
must
have
been
meant
for
snobbishness
would
have
excited
the
slightest
notice
now
said
ess
kay
when
we
were
settled
in
our
places
i
know
a
good
many
people
on
the
ship
but
most
of
them
are
nobodies
and
i
do
intend
to
be
troubled
with
them
nor
do
i
think
that
the
duchess
would
care
to
have
me
let
betty
mix
herself
up
with
anybody
and
everybody
i
shall
do
a
great
deal
of
weeding
and
select
her
acquaintances
carefully
betty
indeed
i
never
told
her
that
she
might
call
me
betty
and
i
hate
having
persons
i
do
care
for
take
hold
of
my
name
without
using
a
handle
to
touch
it
it
makes
me
feel
as
i
did
when
i
was
a
child
and
mother
commanded
me
to
let
myself
be
kissed
by
unkissable
and
extraneous
thank
goodness
vic
and
i
have
come
into
the
world
with
something
of
poor
father
sense
of
humour
my
share
often
serves
me
as
well
as
balm
on
a
wound
or
as
a
nice
dry
crackly
little
biscuit
which
enchanted
to
find
when
you
hungry
and
thought
you
had
nothing
to
eat
and
i
got
a
good
deal
of
quiet
comfort
out
of
it
during
ess
kay
weeding
process
which
otherwise
would
have
done
nothing
but
make
me
squirm
when
we
had
been
on
deck
for
a
short
time
a
number
of
people
came
up
to
speak
to
ess
kay
and
some
to
miss
woodburn
the
water
was
as
smooth
as
the
floor
of
a
ballroom
when
it
been
well
waxed
for
a
dance
and
there
was
no
excuse
for
the
most
sensitive
person
to
be
ill
consequently
the
deck
was
something
like
a
kaleidoscope
with
all
its
moving
groups
of
men
and
women
girls
and
children
most
of
the
and
ones
were
americans
and
a
great
many
seemed
to
know
each
other
some
of
them
laughed
a
good
deal
and
talked
in
high
voices
putting
emphasis
on
prepositions
which
miss
mackinstry
and
the
others
would
never
let
me
do
in
writing
compositions
somehow
though
when
these
people
spoke
it
sounded
very
nice
and
cordial
more
so
than
it
does
when
english
people
greet
each
other
though
the
voices
were
so
sweet
except
a
few
that
drawled
in
a
pretty
southern
way
like
sally
woodburn
i
could
tell
which
were
the
poor
things
that
ess
kay
wanted
to
weed
out
of
her
for
next
season
by
the
way
she
acted
when
they
came
to
say
how
do
you
do
to
her
she
screwed
up
her
eyes
till
they
looked
hard
and
sharp
enough
to
go
through
you
like
a
thin
knife
or
more
like
a
long
slender
hatpin
jabbing
your
head
and
having
waited
an
instant
before
returning
their
greeting
slowly
answered
very
well
thank
you
yes
i
going
home
rather
early
i
due
at
newport
as
soon
as
possible
then
fingered
her
open
book
which
she
had
peeped
into
before
and
made
a
little
just
noticeable
gesture
with
her
lorgnette
then
the
poor
people
were
too
much
crushed
to
stop
and
try
to
talk
to
miss
woodburn
though
she
always
looked
at
them
sweetly
as
if
she
would
make
up
for
her
cousin
being
a
dragon
if
she
could
by
and
by
somebody
else
would
sail
up
perhaps
not
half
as
nice
to
look
at
as
the
one
who
had
gone
but
lo
would
be
suddenly
transformed
she
would
smile
and
hold
out
her
hand
to
their
how
do
you
do
she
would
respond
how
do
you
do
and
though
i
think
she
really
much
interested
in
anyone
but
herself
she
would
ask
where
they
had
been
what
they
had
been
doing
and
how
it
happened
they
were
going
back
so
soon
the
next
thing
she
would
say
to
me
betty
dear
i
should
like
you
and
or
to
know
each
other
as
i
hope
you
meet
again
while
you
staying
with
me
lady
betty
bulkeley
etc
i
wonder
if
you
have
ever
met
her
brother
the
duke
of
stanforth
and
her
cousin
the
marquis
of
loveland
over
in
london
loveland
would
have
had
a
fit
if
he
could
have
heard
her
for
of
course
at
home
only
the
lower
middle
classes
and
such
people
hurl
a
marquis
title
at
his
head
in
that
fashion
but
i
suppose
foreigners
unless
they
been
in
england
a
long
time
do
know
the
difference
when
i
got
a
chance
i
asked
sally
woodburn
how
made
her
distinctions
in
snubbing
some
people
and
preening
herself
to
others
my
deah
said
sally
i
to
call
her
sally
now
it
been
understood
between
us
for
some
time
my
deah
you
a
poor
innocent
child
and
i
reckon
you
been
brought
up
in
darkness
without
even
so
much
as
hearing
of
the
four
hundred
what
are
the
four
hundred
are
they
a
kind
of
light
brigade
like
the
six
hundred
i
asked
or
is
it
a
sort
of
governing
body
like
like
the
council
of
three
she
laughed
so
much
at
this
with
her
charming
velvety
laugh
that
i
grew
quite
nervous
for
it
embarrassing
to
have
said
something
funny
when
you
meant
to
be
rather
intelligent
but
soon
she
took
pity
on
me
you
perfect
love
she
said
that
really
too
sweet
it
deserves
to
be
put
into
or
something
and
yet
you
not
so
far
wrong
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
the
four
hundred
a
kind
of
governing
body
only
i
believe
it
really
reduced
to
two
hundred
now
they
govern
new
york
and
newport
and
lennox
and
bar
harbour
and
several
other
places
which
are
considered
very
nice
and
important
oh
are
they
republicans
or
democrats
i
enquired
sure
that
i
really
was
being
intelligent
at
last
for
i
heard
stan
say
that
in
america
the
republican
party
was
rather
like
our
conservatives
and
the
democrats
like
the
liberals
and
i
remembered
because
i
believe
i
should
be
very
much
interested
in
politics
if
only
i
understood
more
about
them
but
sally
seemed
to
think
that
question
funny
too
they
can
be
either
my
poor
lamb
she
exclaimed
and
they
can
be
almost
anything
else
they
like
if
only
they
just
awfully
dreadfully
rich
and
can
manage
to
scrape
up
a
family
crest
it
used
to
be
the
crest
that
counted
with
the
man
who
invented
the
four
hundred
but
since
his
day
that
idea
has
got
buried
under
heaps
and
heaps
of
gold
and
pearls
and
diamonds
especially
pearls
in
those
places
i
was
telling
you
about
you
do
exist
unless
you
in
the
four
hundred
which
is
now
being
sifted
down
to
two
hundred
and
will
probably
be
in
a
year
or
two
you
may
have
the
bluest
blood
in
america
in
your
veins
you
may
be
simply
with
ancestors
but
if
you
have
managed
to
push
forward
in
a
clever
indescribable
way
neither
they
nor
you
will
ever
be
noticed
and
your
grey
hairs
will
go
down
to
the
grave
in
the
wrong
set
do
you
understand
why
my
cousin
katherine
makes
narrow
eyes
for
some
people
and
broad
smiles
for
others
i
suppose
i
do
i
answered
only
we
are
quite
different
at
home
i
have
been
about
at
all
yet
but
i
know
because
some
things
are
in
the
air
how
did
ever
have
the
poor
wrong
setters
for
acquaintances
though
because
she
kill
me
if
she
heard
this
she
has
only
lately
got
into
the
right
set
herself
and
after
trouble
enough
to
give
an
ordinary
woman
nervous
prostration
that
kind
of
thing
give
it
to
a
lot
of
women
especially
if
they
fail
but
cousin
katherine
very
seldom
fails
she
almost
always
carries
things
through
if
you
knew
anything
about
america
in
general
and
new
york
in
particular
you
be
able
to
realise
what
a
hard
time
she
had
when
i
tell
you
that
till
her
husband
died
she
lived
west
of
chicago
to
get
into
the
four
hundred
if
you
lived
west
of
chicago
unless
you
californian
which
is
getting
to
be
fashionable
is
just
like
having
to
climb
over
one
of
those
great
high
walls
of
yours
in
england
bristling
with
nails
or
broken
glass
my
goodness
i
exclaimed
how
funny
fancy
if
people
who
live
in
surrey
should
glare
at
people
who
live
in
devonshire
that
different
you
see
chicago
is
but
so
is
all
america
is
it
i
asked
stupidly
what
difference
can
a
hundred
or
so
years
make
we
have
begun
to
think
in
centuries
yet
on
our
side
of
the
water
my
deah
she
has
the
most
delicious
way
of
saying
my
deah
and
all
her
r
are
soft
like
that
only
it
too
much
trouble
to
write
them
for
nobody
but
myself
to
see
anyhow
it
so
between
new
york
and
chicago
people
that
is
the
people
who
count
in
society
with
a
big
s
and
it
was
a
great
triumph
for
my
cousin
to
become
the
in
the
four
hundred
she
did
it
by
buying
a
russian
prince
a
yes
love
he
was
going
to
the
highest
bidder
and
she
bought
him
that
is
she
entertained
him
so
gorgeously
and
did
so
many
nice
things
for
him
that
he
posed
as
her
property
and
as
everyone
was
dying
to
meet
him
it
her
she
been
working
killingly
hard
before
that
for
a
whole
year
after
taking
her
house
on
fifth
avenue
and
building
her
cottage
at
newport
but
it
was
buying
the
prince
which
did
the
trick
on
the
strength
of
that
episode
and
its
consequences
she
went
to
europe
with
very
nice
introductions
and
as
you
know
deah
she
has
made
some
valuable
as
well
as
pleasant
friends
to
live
up
to
them
and
her
reputation
she
will
have
to
be
busy
for
a
while
dropping
a
lot
of
old
acquaintances
how
horrid
i
could
help
exclaiming
though
ess
kay
was
going
to
be
my
hostess
yes
it
seems
rather
miserable
to
me
because
i
a
weak
lazy
southern
thing
who
would
be
right
down
sick
if
i
had
to
hurt
any
human
being
feelings
yet
perhaps
it
looks
fair
to
her
she
so
ambitious
and
she
worked
so
hard
she
deserved
to
succeed
as
for
poor
me
she
just
regularly
mesmerises
me
all
through
she
mesmerised
me
into
coming
up
from
kentucky
and
visiting
her
this
spring
then
she
mesmerised
me
into
going
with
her
to
europe
but
not
sorry
i
went
for
i
had
a
good
time
i
so
glad
you
went
said
i
because
if
you
had
i
should
have
met
you
i
sure
i
should
love
kentucky
if
all
the
people
there
are
like
you
but
these
things
you
been
saying
seem
so
odd
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
the
people
who
lead
society
in
new
york
want
to
keep
their
set
limited
to
a
certain
number
and
refuse
to
know
others
even
if
they
extraordinarily
clever
and
interesting
they
do
like
them
to
be
too
clever
because
they
call
such
people
that
is
unless
they
happen
to
be
of
some
sort
from
england
or
other
places
abroad
then
so
long
as
they
not
they
welcome
them
with
open
arms
i
glad
society
is
like
that
in
england
i
said
there
the
people
the
people
who
have
the
right
to
make
social
laws
you
know
are
delighted
with
anyone
who
can
amuse
them
of
course
deep
down
in
our
hearts
we
may
be
proud
if
we
have
old
names
which
have
been
famous
for
hundreds
of
years
in
one
way
or
another
but
we
are
so
used
after
all
those
centuries
to
being
of
ourselves
that
we
just
take
our
position
for
granted
and
do
think
much
more
about
it
if
people
who
have
got
quite
the
same
position
are
gentlefolk
and
amusing
or
clever
or
beautiful
or
anything
like
that
which
really
matters
why
we
only
too
pleased
with
them
that
all
the
difference
in
the
world
you
been
of
yourselves
for
centuries
you
said
the
last
word
my
deah
of
the
mouths
of
babes
but
cousin
katherine
finished
gushing
to
that
silly
old
van
der
windt
we
must
dare
discuss
these
things
from
our
point
of
view
any
more
i
reckon
she
would
faint
there
are
a
good
many
young
men
on
board
and
some
of
them
seemed
to
be
quite
devoted
to
ess
kay
the
first
day
out
but
she
was
cold
to
them
all
i
could
think
why
as
some
of
them
seemed
very
nice
and
she
had
always
appeared
rather
to
like
being
with
men
i
asked
sally
about
it
but
she
laughed
and
said
i
might
perhaps
solve
the
mystery
for
myself
when
we
were
at
newport
if
i
remembered
it
then
i
never
heard
of
such
breakfasts
and
luncheons
as
they
have
on
this
ship
and
the
first
menu
i
saw
surprised
me
so
much
that
i
believe
they
really
had
and
could
produce
all
those
things
if
anybody
was
inconsiderate
enough
to
ask
for
them
i
hardly
supposed
there
were
so
many
things
to
eat
in
the
world
but
the
captain
heard
me
exclaiming
to
sally
so
he
smiled
and
told
me
to
test
the
menu
by
ordering
a
bit
of
everything
on
it
he
guarantee
that
nothing
would
be
missed
out
this
was
at
breakfast
the
second
day
and
when
he
saw
that
i
ate
several
dear
little
round
things
shaped
like
doyleys
which
are
called
pancakes
though
they
are
a
bit
like
ours
with
some
perfectly
divine
stuff
named
maple
syrup
he
said
my
taking
such
a
fancy
to
american
products
was
a
sign
that
i
should
marry
an
american
what
nonsense
as
if
i
would
dream
of
marrying
especially
a
foreigner
but
for
all
that
pancakes
and
maple
syrup
are
delicious
i
had
them
every
day
since
for
breakfast
after
finishing
a
great
orange
four
times
the
natural
size
which
is
an
orange
because
it
a
grape
fruit
you
have
it
on
your
plate
cut
in
two
halves
with
ice
in
each
and
you
scoop
the
inside
out
of
a
lot
of
tiny
pockets
with
a
teaspoon
you
think
when
you
first
see
it
that
you
ca
eat
more
than
half
but
instead
you
eat
every
bit
and
sometimes
if
the
morning
is
hot
you
even
wish
you
could
have
more
though
of
course
you
be
so
greedy
as
to
ask
it
was
on
the
second
day
out
too
that
all
my
troubles
began
and
in
a
queer
way
which
nobody
could
have
guessed
would
lead
to
anything
disagreeable
in
the
afternoon
i
was
reading
in
my
drawn
close
to
ess
kay
side
when
that
van
der
windt
whom
sally
called
a
silly
old
thing
toddled
up
and
spoke
to
us
do
come
and
watch
them
dancing
in
the
steerage
she
said
it
such
fun
ess
kay
likes
sitting
still
on
shipboard
better
than
anything
else
but
it
seems
that
van
der
windt
is
so
important
that
if
all
the
four
hundred
sally
told
me
about
were
pruned
away
except
about
she
would
be
among
the
number
left
so
probably
that
is
the
reason
why
ess
kay
takes
long
walks
up
and
down
the
deck
with
her
though
it
makes
her
giddy
to
walk
and
van
der
windt
is
not
in
the
least
entertaining
she
got
up
now
like
a
lamb
about
to
be
led
to
the
slaughter
except
that
she
smiled
bravely
which
the
lamb
would
not
be
able
to
bring
itself
to
do
come
betty
she
said
to
me
it
will
amuse
you
yes
do
come
lady
betty
repeated
van
der
windt
whereupon
i
obeyed
little
knowing
what
i
was
laying
up
for
myself
our
deck
is
amidships
aft
on
a
level
with
ours
is
the
deck
and
down
below
like
looking
into
a
pit
is
the
steerage
we
walked
to
the
rail
over
which
quite
a
number
of
men
were
leaning
to
see
what
was
going
on
and
several
moved
aside
to
give
us
room
i
did
like
to
take
their
places
away
especially
as
they
were
laughing
and
enjoying
themselves
and
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
dance
music
coming
up
from
below
such
music
but
ess
kay
murmured
to
me
that
i
must
refuse
american
men
are
never
so
happy
she
said
as
when
they
giving
up
something
for
a
woman
they
used
to
it
and
evidently
she
as
an
american
woman
was
used
to
taking
it
she
and
van
der
windt
slipped
into
the
vacant
spaces
with
a
bare
thank
you
and
i
had
to
follow
their
example
we
peered
down
over
the
rail
and
there
was
a
sight
which
would
have
been
comical
if
it
had
been
pathetic
on
rather
a
deck
about
twelve
feet
or
more
below
us
a
dense
crowd
was
collected
round
two
small
squares
which
they
purposely
left
open
besides
those
little
squares
every
inch
was
occupied
there
would
have
been
any
more
room
for
even
a
baby
to
sit
down
than
there
was
in
the
black
hole
of
calcutta
in
the
crowd
were
old
men
young
men
and
boys
all
poorly
dressed
and
old
women
young
women
and
girls
big
and
little
they
wore
crude
vivid
colours
and
more
than
half
of
them
had
bright
handkerchiefs
tied
over
their
heads
they
scarcely
took
any
notice
of
the
passengers
staring
down
superciliously
or
pityingly
at
their
poor
amusements
they
were
far
too
much
absorbed
in
the
dancing
which
was
going
on
busily
i
ca
say
gaily
in
the
two
hollow
squares
in
one
of
these
an
elderly
pinched
little
man
who
looked
almost
was
monotonously
scraping
a
battered
fiddle
for
two
solemn
couples
to
dance
round
and
round
always
on
the
same
axis
but
the
other
dancing
salon
was
more
lively
there
a
man
dressed
like
a
buffoon
with
a
tall
hat
a
lobster
claw
for
a
nose
a
uniform
with
big
red
flannel
epaulettes
and
pasteboard
buttons
covered
with
gold
paper
was
pretending
to
conduct
the
band
and
what
a
band
it
was
it
consisted
of
four
sailors
rather
and
one
musical
instrument
was
a
wooden
box
rigged
up
with
strings
and
a
long
handle
another
was
formed
from
a
couple
of
huge
tied
together
on
which
the
player
beat
rhythmically
with
a
smaller
spoon
the
third
was
a
poker
dangling
from
a
string
banged
heartily
with
an
enormous
nail
as
it
swung
to
and
fro
the
fourth
was
a
queer
drum
which
looked
as
if
it
had
been
made
out
of
a
wooden
bandbox
somehow
they
contrived
to
coax
out
music
of
a
sort
and
a
few
young
men
and
girls
were
solemnly
gyrating
to
it
in
a
way
to
make
you
giddy
even
to
watch
when
a
man
thought
he
had
had
enough
or
wanted
to
dance
with
another
girl
he
dropped
his
partner
with
alarming
suddenness
bowed
stiffly
without
smile
or
word
and
left
her
it
was
evidently
etiquette
not
to
speak
to
your
partner
at
the
end
of
a
dance
the
conductor
with
the
nose
looked
up
to
our
deck
bowing
low
with
his
hand
on
his
heart
and
then
all
the
audience
leaning
over
the
rail
began
fumbling
in
their
pockets
if
they
were
men
or
opening
their
purses
or
gold
bags
if
they
were
women
down
poured
a
shower
of
small
silver
and
copper
little
boys
scrambling
to
pick
it
up
and
hand
it
to
the
conductor
who
would
van
der
windt
said
divide
the
money
among
the
members
of
his
quaint
band
i
had
a
few
shillings
with
me
and
i
been
so
much
amused
that
i
felt
like
being
generous
luckily
mother
could
see
me
and
scold
i
took
half
a
dozen
coins
shillings
and
sixpences
and
wrapping
them
hurriedly
up
in
half
the
cover
torn
off
a
magazine
i
was
reading
i
aimed
the
little
parcel
to
fall
at
the
comic
conductor
feet
generally
i
can
throw
fairly
straight
for
stan
took
some
pains
with
that
part
of
my
education
when
i
was
a
small
girl
but
just
at
that
instant
someone
standing
next
me
moved
knocked
me
on
the
elbow
and
spoilt
my
aim
instead
of
falling
in
front
of
the
parcel
hit
the
ear
of
a
very
tall
young
man
among
the
crowd
below
who
had
been
standing
with
his
back
to
me
he
turned
quickly
not
knowing
what
had
happened
glanced
up
and
caught
my
eyes
as
i
was
looking
down
quite
distressed
illustration
turned
around
quickly
glanced
up
and
caught
my
eyes
as
i
was
looking
down
quite
i
had
noticed
his
figure
in
the
crush
because
he
towered
nearly
a
head
over
everyone
else
and
i
had
a
dim
impression
that
he
had
good
shoulders
but
seeing
his
face
gave
me
a
great
surprise
it
was
as
different
from
all
the
rest
of
the
steerage
faces
as
day
is
from
night
and
somehow
it
gave
me
quite
a
shock
that
such
a
man
should
be
among
those
others
as
if
something
must
be
wrong
with
the
world
or
it
could
not
happen
i
had
even
a
guilty
sort
of
thrill
as
if
i
had
no
right
to
be
and
prosperous
staring
at
him
and
his
companions
as
though
they
were
a
show
which
we
others
paid
to
see
daring
to
amuse
ourselves
with
the
hard
strange
conditions
of
their
lives
i
heard
mother
say
that
good
blood
is
sure
to
prove
itself
that
a
gentleman
ca
look
like
a
common
man
even
in
rags
stan
disputes
that
theory
with
her
when
he
is
too
lazy
and
wants
to
bet
he
could
so
disguise
himself
that
she
would
take
him
for
a
green
grocer
or
a
fishmonger
who
have
the
air
of
being
commoner
than
other
men
i
think
at
least
in
our
village
at
battlemead
because
they
wear
fat
tufts
of
curls
frothing
out
over
their
foreheads
from
under
their
caps
which
are
always
plaid
and
made
of
cloth
anyway
if
mother
is
right
this
man
in
the
steerage
must
have
the
bluest
of
blood
in
his
veins
for
i
never
saw
one
with
clearer
nobler
features
and
yet
he
does
give
the
impression
of
a
gentleman
who
has
gone
the
pace
and
paid
for
it
by
stumbling
into
the
depths
i
thought
as
he
looked
up
straight
into
my
face
that
first
time
and
i
think
still
that
no
face
could
be
finer
or
more
manly
than
his
brown
deep
brown
it
is
like
bronze
and
not
rough
and
scrubby
with
dark
grey
eyes
i
knew
at
once
they
were
grey
because
the
light
struck
into
them
rimmed
with
black
lashes
so
long
you
could
help
noticing
them
black
eyebrows
and
hair
short
and
sleek
like
stan
or
any
other
man
one
knows
besides
commonness
shows
in
people
mouths
more
than
anywhere
else
it
hard
to
define
but
it
there
and
this
man
mouth
is
the
best
part
of
his
face
unless
it
the
chin
or
perhaps
the
nose
i
not
quite
sure
which
though
i
thought
a
good
deal
about
them
all
because
of
the
mystery
of
finding
such
a
man
in
such
an
unsuitable
place
it
would
be
just
the
same
if
you
saw
a
tall
palm
suddenly
shooting
up
in
the
and
could
find
out
how
it
had
been
planted
there
i
afraid
i
must
have
shown
how
surprised
i
was
and
admiring
too
maybe
how
can
one
keep
from
admiring
what
is
fine
and
noble
whether
it
a
strange
person
face
or
the
profile
of
a
mountain
against
a
sky
at
sunset
for
the
handsome
steerage
passenger
looked
at
me
a
long
long
instant
as
if
he
were
as
much
astonished
as
i
was
and
yet
with
such
a
nice
look
that
instead
of
being
annoyed
i
could
help
being
pleased
in
the
meantime
the
little
packet
of
money
had
fallen
on
the
deck
but
though
it
had
struck
him
from
behind
he
seemed
to
realise
exactly
what
had
happened
and
stooping
down
he
picked
it
up
then
he
raised
his
hand
high
so
that
i
could
see
he
had
the
crumpled
ball
of
paper
in
it
and
edging
his
way
determinedly
but
not
at
all
roughly
through
the
crowd
he
opened
the
parcel
and
gave
the
money
to
the
conductor
what
a
man
i
said
in
a
low
voice
to
ess
kay
is
it
extraordinary
that
he
should
be
in
the
steerage
come
away
my
dear
child
she
answered
i
ca
have
you
standing
here
to
be
stared
at
by
low
creatures
like
that
the
fellow
not
in
the
he
only
a
big
hulking
animal
take
to
making
up
romances
about
the
steerage
passengers
my
love
they
not
worth
bothering
your
little
head
about
because
if
they
were
born
for
that
sort
of
thing
they
would
be
there
i
assure
you
i
did
say
anything
more
though
i
was
vexed
with
her
both
for
being
so
stupidly
conventional
and
for
speaking
to
me
in
such
a
loud
tone
that
she
attracted
people
attention
we
went
back
to
our
and
there
was
nothing
to
remind
me
of
the
little
episode
except
the
torn
cover
of
my
magazine
on
which
i
now
remembered
sally
woodburn
had
scrawled
my
name
over
and
over
again
in
pencil
just
in
idleness
while
she
and
i
had
been
talking
that
morning
if
ess
kay
had
known
no
doubt
she
would
have
been
furious
that
a
piece
of
paper
with
my
name
on
it
should
have
gone
down
into
the
steerage
but
i
did
mind
for
i
remembered
that
the
young
man
had
opened
the
parcel
given
the
money
to
the
conductor
and
kept
the
cover
which
probably
he
had
soon
after
thrown
overboard
or
twisted
up
to
light
a
pipe
nothing
more
happened
that
day
but
there
are
two
nice
american
girls
on
board
about
my
own
age
or
a
little
older
they
years
older
for
they
are
so
charming
and
and
ess
kay
encourages
me
to
like
them
as
they
are
in
van
der
windt
party
i
grew
quite
well
acquainted
with
them
the
third
day
out
and
they
asked
me
to
go
and
watch
the
people
in
the
steerage
who
had
a
little
trick
dog
which
was
lots
of
fun
i
went
and
saw
the
bronze
young
man
again
he
was
standing
with
his
arms
folded
across
his
chest
leaning
against
one
of
the
supports
of
a
kind
of
bridge
looking
up
towards
the
deck
our
eyes
met
as
they
had
before
and
i
was
so
absurd
that
i
felt
myself
blushing
i
could
have
boxed
my
own
ears
and
though
the
trained
dog
really
was
a
pet
i
did
stay
long
it
is
strange
how
certain
kinds
of
eyes
haunt
one
you
see
them
in
the
air
as
if
they
were
really
looking
at
you
especially
when
you
are
just
dropping
off
to
sleep
i
think
grey
ones
do
this
more
than
others
perhaps
it
is
because
they
are
more
piercing
but
it
was
on
the
fourth
day
that
the
climax
came
the
climax
which
has
ended
by
upsetting
me
so
much
and
has
made
everything
so
uncomfortable
the
weather
was
glorious
all
blue
and
gold
after
a
sulky
leaden
day
and
there
was
dancing
down
on
the
steerage
deck
again
though
it
was
so
fine
the
water
was
not
smooth
like
a
floor
as
it
had
been
at
first
but
broken
into
indigo
waves
ruffled
irregularly
with
silver
lace
and
edged
with
shimmering
pearl
fringe
the
same
performance
was
going
on
down
there
on
the
crowded
deck
that
i
seen
the
first
day
and
sally
woodburn
and
i
who
had
been
walking
counting
the
times
we
went
round
to
make
two
miles
stopped
to
glance
at
the
show
there
that
man
cousin
katherine
classifies
as
a
hulking
animal
said
sally
i
must
really
consult
the
dictionary
for
a
definition
of
the
word
i
do
know
whether
it
a
verb
or
adjective
do
you
no
i
do
said
i
but
whichever
it
is
i
sure
he
does
or
is
he
a
gentleman
and
something
strange
has
happened
or
he
would
be
there
i
do
think
it
a
shame
it
must
be
horrible
do
you
think
cousin
katherine
knows
more
about
such
persons
than
you
asked
sally
and
there
was
such
a
funny
quaver
in
her
voice
that
i
turned
to
see
what
it
meant
she
was
laughing
but
whether
at
me
or
at
ess
kay
or
at
the
man
with
the
nose
i
tell
and
before
i
could
answer
her
question
by
asking
another
something
happened
which
put
the
whole
conversation
out
of
my
mind
the
ship
curtseyed
to
a
wave
of
more
importance
than
any
that
had
gone
before
then
righted
herself
quickly
we
slid
a
little
everybody
who
could
catching
hold
of
the
rail
or
of
some
friend
arm
laughing
but
down
on
the
steerage
deck
there
rose
a
cry
which
was
laughter
child
overboard
someone
screamed
and
i
realised
with
a
horrid
feeling
like
suffocation
that
a
tiny
boy
down
below
who
had
climbed
up
on
the
rail
to
watch
the
dancing
was
missing
it
was
a
woman
who
had
screamed
and
everything
followed
so
quickly
that
my
mind
was
confused
as
if
a
whirlwind
had
rushed
through
it
and
blown
all
the
impressions
on
top
of
one
another
in
a
heap
there
was
a
babel
of
voices
on
the
steerage
deck
more
cries
and
shouts
and
screams
and
people
surged
in
a
solid
wave
toward
the
rail
to
look
over
but
out
of
that
wave
sprang
one
figure
separating
itself
from
the
other
atoms
and
then
i
heard
myself
give
a
cry
too
for
the
man
who
had
been
in
my
thoughts
had
thrown
off
his
coat
and
vaulted
over
the
rail
into
the
sea
jove
he
be
caught
by
the
propeller
i
heard
somebody
near
me
say
i
turned
sick
the
thought
of
his
life
being
crushed
out
while
we
all
looked
on
helpless
was
awful
the
sea
was
terrible
enough
in
itself
the
great
wide
merciless
blue
water
which
sparkled
so
coldly
and
laughed
in
its
power
but
to
be
crunched
up
by
the
jaws
of
a
monster
i
shut
my
eyes
and
could
open
them
until
i
heard
men
saying
the
strong
wind
to
starboard
might
save
him
i
believe
i
must
have
been
unconsciously
praying
and
my
hands
were
clasped
so
tightly
together
that
afterwards
my
fingers
ached
people
on
our
deck
made
a
rush
towards
the
stern
on
the
port
side
for
the
ship
had
been
steaming
so
fast
that
already
we
were
forging
away
from
the
child
who
had
fallen
and
the
man
who
had
jumped
after
him
sally
and
i
were
carried
along
with
the
rush
she
seized
me
by
the
hand
but
we
did
speak
a
word
if
dear
friends
instead
of
two
strangers
in
a
far
remote
sphere
of
life
had
been
in
deadly
danger
i
do
think
the
sickness
at
my
heart
could
have
been
worse
i
would
have
given
years
if
at
that
moment
i
could
have
had
the
magical
power
to
stop
the
ship
instantly
with
one
wave
of
my
hand
but
it
was
being
stopped
by
another
power
than
mine
i
felt
the
deck
shiver
under
my
feet
like
a
thoroughbred
horse
pulled
on
to
his
haunches
the
accident
had
been
seen
from
the
bridge
an
order
to
stop
the
ship
had
been
telegraphed
down
to
the
and
obeyed
still
when
sally
woodburn
and
i
had
been
carried
by
the
crowd
far
enough
towards
the
stern
to
look
out
over
the
blue
wilderness
of
water
we
were
leaving
behind
the
ship
heart
had
ceased
its
throb
throb
to
which
we
had
all
grown
so
accustomed
in
the
last
few
days
he
got
the
child
exclaimed
sally
see
he
hauling
the
little
creature
on
to
his
back
with
one
hand
and
swimming
with
the
other
glorious
fellow
yes
there
were
the
two
heads
bobbing
like
black
corks
in
the
tossing
waves
close
together
i
pictured
so
vividly
what
my
sensations
would
be
if
i
were
down
there
a
mere
speck
in
that
vast
expanse
of
blue
that
i
almost
tasted
salt
water
in
my
mouth
and
felt
the
choking
tingle
of
it
in
my
lungs
then
suddenly
the
ship
heart
ceased
to
beat
and
the
unaccustomed
stillness
was
as
startling
as
an
unexpected
noise
a
boat
shot
down
from
the
davits
with
several
sailors
on
board
a
few
seconds
later
they
were
rowing
away
towards
those
two
bobbing
black
corks
and
i
loved
them
as
they
bent
to
their
oars
i
ca
remember
breathing
once
or
even
winking
until
i
saw
the
child
being
lifted
into
the
boat
and
the
man
climbing
in
after
what
a
shout
went
up
from
the
ship
sally
clapped
her
pretty
dimpled
hands
but
i
only
let
my
breath
go
at
last
in
a
great
sigh
there
was
such
a
crush
that
i
could
see
them
when
they
came
on
board
but
there
was
more
shouting
and
hurrahing
and
men
slapped
each
other
on
the
shoulder
and
laughed
throb
throb
went
the
machinery
again
and
there
was
no
sign
that
anything
out
of
the
monotonous
round
had
happened
except
in
the
excited
way
that
people
talked
several
men
we
knew
paid
a
visit
to
the
steerage
and
came
back
with
stories
which
flew
about
from
group
to
group
in
the
cabin
and
no
doubt
the
second
too
it
seemed
that
the
little
boy
who
had
fallen
into
the
sea
was
the
only
son
of
his
mother
a
widow
they
were
swedes
and
the
woman
who
is
on
her
way
to
the
states
to
try
and
find
a
place
as
a
servant
was
quite
prostrated
with
the
agonising
suspense
she
had
suffered
as
for
the
little
boy
himself
he
was
not
seriously
the
worse
for
his
experience
the
doctor
was
with
him
and
said
that
he
would
be
as
well
as
ever
in
a
few
hours
a
subscription
for
the
mother
and
child
had
already
been
started
among
the
passengers
and
would
probably
be
made
up
to
quite
a
good
sum
but
what
is
going
to
be
done
for
the
one
who
saved
the
little
life
i
asked
the
man
who
was
telling
me
the
news
a
doremus
who
is
a
cousin
of
van
der
windt
very
full
of
fun
and
good
natured
a
nice
little
pedestal
labelled
hero
will
be
built
out
of
the
ladies
admiration
and
given
to
him
to
pose
on
said
doremus
however
i
must
say
for
the
gentleman
though
i
only
seen
him
dripping
wet
and
shaking
himself
like
a
big
dog
he
did
give
me
the
impression
of
being
the
sort
of
chap
to
say
you
for
the
perch
of
course
he
is
said
i
but
i
do
think
it
a
shame
if
he
left
out
when
subscriptions
are
going
round
of
course
he
must
be
poor
or
he
would
be
travelling
in
the
steerage
something
ought
to
be
done
to
show
him
that
the
passengers
admire
his
bravery
not
anything
but
something
i
guess
you
do
know
the
american
disposition
yet
as
well
as
you
will
after
you
wrestled
with
it
on
its
native
heath
for
a
few
months
remarked
doremus
in
his
quaint
way
that
chap
down
in
the
steerage
an
american
whatever
else
he
may
be
or
i
eat
my
best
hat
and
i
would
for
five
cents
be
in
the
deputation
to
present
him
with
the
something
fulsome
but
nice
on
a
little
silver
salver
i
should
expect
him
to
give
me
the
frosty
mitt
this
expression
struck
me
as
being
so
funny
that
i
burst
out
laughing
though
i
had
to
stop
and
think
for
a
second
before
i
could
quite
see
what
doremus
really
meant
but
i
would
forget
my
point
in
a
laugh
perhaps
it
would
do
to
offer
money
i
went
on
suppose
we
got
up
a
subscription
to
buy
him
a
passage
for
the
rest
of
the
way
that
would
show
appreciation
would
it
it
would
replied
doremus
gravely
and
if
you
start
the
subscription
lady
betty
it
go
like
wildfire
very
well
then
i
will
said
i
though
i
rather
someone
else
did
it
it
would
be
so
popular
from
any
other
quarter
i
help
you
go
floating
around
together
and
pass
the
plate
and
if
you
like
do
the
talking
i
agreed
to
this
and
if
i
thought
about
it
at
all
i
should
have
supposed
that
ess
kay
would
be
as
pleased
as
punch
with
such
an
arrangement
because
doremus
as
a
relative
of
van
der
windt
is
the
only
man
on
board
to
whom
she
makes
herself
agreeable
it
appears
that
he
has
started
several
fashions
in
new
york
the
most
important
being
to
drive
in
some
park
they
have
there
without
a
hat
but
probably
if
the
truth
were
known
he
lost
it
like
the
fox
that
tried
to
make
his
friends
chop
off
their
tails
ess
kay
had
gone
to
her
stateroom
soon
after
lunch
as
the
motion
of
the
ship
had
given
her
a
headache
and
i
did
happen
to
be
near
sally
woodburn
so
i
said
yes
to
doremus
on
the
impulse
of
the
moment
without
stopping
to
think
whether
i
ought
to
ask
permission
first
we
had
great
fun
going
about
for
doremus
was
so
witty
and
said
such
amusing
things
to
the
people
he
begged
of
that
i
could
hardly
speak
for
laughing
and
everyone
else
laughed
too
i
wished
that
he
would
put
me
forward
always
and
say
it
was
my
idea
and
i
had
started
the
subscription
but
he
argued
that
i
must
sacrifice
myself
for
the
success
of
the
charity
just
as
i
would
at
home
if
i
had
to
work
off
damaged
pincushions
or
day
before
yesterday
violets
at
a
bazaar
of
course
not
being
out
i
never
sold
anything
at
bazaars
but
victoria
is
continually
doing
it
in
the
season
and
she
makes
quite
a
virtue
of
forcing
perfect
strangers
to
stand
and
deliver
as
she
calls
it
this
seemed
much
the
same
sort
of
thing
to
me
and
so
i
felt
nice
and
virtuous
too
as
vic
does
when
she
comes
home
with
a
new
frock
torn
and
stepped
on
and
lies
in
bed
late
next
day
with
thompson
to
brush
her
hair
and
me
to
read
to
her
people
were
very
kind
and
though
they
laughed
a
great
deal
they
gave
so
much
that
before
we
been
half
the
rounds
doremus
said
we
had
more
than
enough
for
our
friend
he
wanted
to
know
if
i
would
like
to
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
and
settle
matters
at
once
by
arranging
with
the
purser
for
a
cabin
to
be
put
at
the
disposal
i
wanted
him
to
do
that
part
alone
but
he
pretended
to
be
shy
and
said
he
had
grown
to
depend
so
entirely
on
my
that
he
felt
unequal
to
undertaking
any
responsibility
without
it
he
told
the
same
story
to
the
purser
that
he
had
told
others
about
my
being
the
one
to
start
the
subscription
and
he
wanted
me
to
sign
a
kind
of
letter
which
he
wrote
to
the
effect
that
the
passengers
had
chosen
this
way
of
testifying
their
appreciation
of
a
gallant
deed
and
so
on
but
i
would
and
he
stopped
teasing
at
last
when
he
saw
that
i
was
going
to
be
vexed
after
the
business
was
what
doremus
called
fixed
up
he
took
me
back
to
my
chair
on
deck
sally
was
in
her
place
and
as
i
was
wondering
what
had
become
of
her
the
bugle
went
wailing
over
the
ship
like
a
hungry
banshee
i
said
to
myself
that
sally
must
have
gone
early
because
her
frock
was
to
be
particularly
elaborate
i
felt
conscious
of
having
heaps
of
interesting
things
to
tell
and
i
understood
exactly
what
victoria
means
when
she
says
in
one
of
her
pretty
and
popular
moods
i
danced
into
our
stateroom
where
only
a
drawn
curtain
covers
the
open
doorway
no
one
was
there
and
the
cabin
was
so
quiet
that
it
seemed
to
greet
me
with
a
warning
down
fell
my
spirits
with
a
dull
thud
though
i
did
know
why
my
joyousness
changed
to
what
storybook
writers
describe
as
a
foreboding
of
disaster
but
when
i
have
it
it
generally
connected
with
a
lecture
from
mother
so
i
know
it
only
as
a
sneaky
i
have
eaten
the
cream
sort
of
feeling
just
as
i
had
begun
to
take
off
my
frock
louise
appeared
at
the
door
which
leads
into
the
little
she
said
that
if
i
pleased
madame
would
be
glad
to
see
me
in
her
cabin
i
hurried
across
to
the
other
opposite
ours
and
there
found
ess
kay
in
a
gorgeously
embroidered
pink
satin
japanese
thing
which
she
calls
a
kimona
she
was
sitting
in
a
chair
in
front
of
the
makeshift
putting
on
her
rings
and
clasping
bracelets
on
her
wrists
with
vicious
snaps
sally
who
had
begun
to
dress
was
standing
up
looking
almost
cross
that
is
with
different
features
from
hers
she
might
have
succeeded
in
looking
cross
sit
down
betty
please
i
want
to
talk
to
you
said
ess
kay
somehow
it
always
makes
me
feel
stiff
when
she
betty
me
as
my
old
nurse
says
it
does
with
your
ears
if
you
eat
broad
beans
if
i
do
i
shall
be
late
for
dinner
said
i
just
as
if
a
minute
ago
i
had
been
dying
to
pour
out
my
news
never
mind
dinner
my
dear
girl
replied
ess
kay
with
an
air
which
i
do
believe
she
tried
to
copy
from
mother
what
i
have
to
say
is
more
important
than
dinner
i
hope
what
i
have
been
hearing
true
that
depends
upon
what
it
was
i
retorted
disguising
my
pertness
with
a
smile
do
think
i
been
tattling
said
sally
whatever
my
faults
may
be
have
a
rubber
neck
i
did
know
in
the
least
what
she
meant
but
afterwards
she
explained
that
if
your
neck
is
always
pivoting
round
to
pry
into
other
affairs
it
is
a
rubber
neck
and
i
shall
remember
the
expression
to
tell
stan
when
i
go
home
he
will
like
to
add
it
to
his
collection
of
strange
beasts
ess
kay
partly
turned
her
back
upon
sally
the
dear
duchess
she
always
speaks
of
mother
in
that
way
the
dear
duchess
has
entrusted
you
to
my
charge
betty
and
i
do
know
what
i
shall
do
if
you
take
advantage
of
me
by
playing
naughty
tricks
whenever
i
am
incapacitated
from
chaperoning
you
for
half
an
hour
one
would
have
thought
i
was
a
trained
dog
i
simply
stared
with
saucer
eyes
and
she
went
on
collingwood
came
in
to
enquire
for
my
headache
and
she
told
me
that
you
have
been
running
about
begging
for
money
to
give
to
a
common
man
in
the
steerage
i
sent
instantly
for
sally
but
she
either
knows
or
pretends
to
know
nothing
i
rushed
into
explanations
sure
that
when
ess
kay
understood
i
should
be
pronounced
not
guilty
but
to
my
surprise
her
chin
grew
squarer
and
squarer
and
her
eyes
harder
and
lighter
till
they
looked
almost
white
i
do
want
to
be
harsh
she
said
at
last
in
the
tone
people
use
when
they
walking
on
the
ragged
edge
of
their
patience
but
for
the
duchess
sake
i
must
be
it
was
very
wrong
of
tommy
doremus
to
let
you
make
yourself
so
conspicuous
this
may
lead
to
your
being
dreadfully
misunderstood
and
putting
yourself
and
all
of
us
in
a
false
position
the
man
may
be
a
for
all
you
know
his
complexion
is
pink
and
white
enough
for
a
butcher
said
i
besides
i
thought
that
in
america
one
man
was
as
good
as
another
you
were
never
more
mistaken
in
your
life
my
dear
girl
and
the
sooner
you
correct
such
an
impression
the
better
or
you
may
get
into
serious
trouble
from
which
i
ca
save
you
if
the
steerage
man
a
butcher
he
probably
a
professional
swimmer
and
the
whole
thing
was
a
to
advertise
himself
in
fact
i
am
pretty
certain
from
what
collingwood
said
it
that
and
i
want
you
to
promise
me
solemnly
that
you
will
go
around
helping
to
advertise
the
creature
any
more
if
you
say
you
admire
such
a
person
people
will
think
you
like
the
matinée
girls
who
wait
at
stage
doors
and
run
after
actors
i
was
so
angry
that
i
talked
back
and
it
finally
ended
in
our
relations
being
somewhat
strained
at
dinner
which
ruined
my
appetite
until
a
peculiarly
soothing
iced
pudding
came
on
afterwards
ess
kay
was
cool
to
doremus
and
would
have
been
cold
i
think
if
he
were
van
der
windt
cousin
he
lounged
up
to
our
place
on
deck
to
give
me
the
news
that
the
third
class
hero
as
he
calls
the
bronze
young
man
refused
to
be
second
class
he
had
asked
permission
to
give
the
cabin
offered
him
to
the
child
whose
life
he
had
saved
and
the
mother
it
for
you
to
say
yes
or
no
lady
betty
announced
doremus
because
it
your
show
you
set
the
top
spinning
she
is
to
have
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
affair
ess
kay
answered
for
me
quickly
she
is
very
sorry
she
commenced
it
and
has
lost
the
small
interest
she
felt
in
the
beginning
i
do
hope
that
tramp
or
beggar
or
whatever
he
is
has
gotten
it
in
his
conceited
head
that
lady
betty
bulkeley
has
bothered
herself
about
his
insignificant
affairs
or
he
be
thrusting
himself
upon
her
notice
in
some
way
which
will
be
very
disagreeable
for
as
her
guardian
well
he
has
sent
a
message
of
thanks
to
everyone
concerned
said
tommy
doremus
i
do
know
whether
he
put
lady
betty
at
the
top
of
the
list
or
not
and
if
that
the
way
you
feel
about
our
nice
little
stunt
i
expect
it
just
as
well
not
to
enquire
further
all
the
rest
of
the
trip
has
been
spoiled
for
me
by
the
hateful
way
in
which
the
excitement
of
that
day
ended
and
it
does
seem
too
bad
for
everything
might
have
been
so
nice
whether
people
really
do
make
jokes
or
not
i
do
know
but
anyhow
ess
kay
keeps
hinting
that
they
do
which
is
almost
as
disagreeable
for
me
she
says
that
they
have
nicknamed
the
bronze
man
lady
betty
hero
and
this
has
made
me
so
that
i
ca
bear
to
go
near
the
part
of
the
deck
where
you
look
over
into
the
steerage
for
fear
some
silly
creatures
may
think
i
trying
to
see
him
i
feel
as
if
i
had
been
a
conspicuous
idiot
and
i
so
uncomfortable
with
ess
kay
now
that
i
expect
to
be
wretched
in
her
house
i
ca
talk
it
over
even
with
sally
because
after
all
she
ess
kay
cousin
i
wish
i
had
a
nose
two
inches
long
and
green
hair
and
then
perhaps
mother
and
vic
would
have
let
me
stop
at
home
still
i
ca
help
taking
an
interest
in
ship
life
and
now
that
the
morning
of
the
last
day
on
board
i
look
back
on
it
all
as
if
it
ought
to
have
been
even
more
fun
than
it
was
i
enjoyed
hearing
about
the
marconigrams
when
they
came
it
seemed
like
living
in
a
tale
by
stan
favourite
jules
verne
to
have
messages
come
flying
to
us
in
like
invisible
carrier
pigeons
i
enjoyed
having
doremus
tell
me
about
his
luck
in
the
big
pools
when
the
men
bet
on
the
day
run
and
i
afraid
i
rather
revelled
in
seeing
a
row
on
deck
one
evening
when
one
man
accused
another
of
being
a
cheat
and
a
professional
gambler
and
almost
cried
about
some
money
he
lost
if
i
had
been
the
first
man
i
would
have
trusted
the
other
in
the
beginning
because
he
had
fat
lips
greasy
black
curls
and
wicked
eyes
so
close
together
you
felt
they
might
run
into
one
if
he
winked
too
hard
on
a
hot
day
but
if
i
been
so
stupid
as
to
trust
him
i
would
have
been
ashamed
to
make
a
fuss
afterwards
i
think
people
ought
to
be
sporting
i
liked
the
captain
dinner
too
in
honour
of
the
last
night
on
board
with
the
flags
and
decorations
the
band
playing
military
music
the
dishes
on
the
menu
named
after
famous
generals
and
the
stewards
filing
in
in
a
long
procession
when
the
salon
had
been
darkened
each
carrying
a
illuminated
ice
and
cake
with
tiny
english
and
american
and
german
flags
stuck
into
the
top
yes
i
liked
everything
except
but
now
it
is
nearly
over
america
is
just
round
the
corner
of
the
world
iii
about
new
york
after
you
have
seen
nothing
but
water
for
days
it
odd
how
excited
you
are
on
seeing
a
little
land
just
a
little
little
land
and
not
at
all
interesting
to
look
at
a
strip
of
grey
sand
or
a
patch
of
green
grass
and
you
have
been
only
a
few
days
away
from
such
things
yet
somehow
you
want
to
jump
up
and
down
and
shout
for
joy
more
than
half
the
passengers
on
our
ship
were
americans
coming
home
and
i
suppose
they
had
gone
away
because
they
wanted
to
go
if
they
had
liked
they
could
have
stopped
in
their
own
country
as
well
as
not
and
i
heard
some
of
them
saying
during
the
voyage
that
if
they
could
they
would
spend
nine
months
out
of
the
year
in
paris
but
they
made
as
much
fuss
over
the
first
lump
of
sand
we
saw
as
if
we
were
discovering
the
north
pole
some
of
them
had
taken
this
trip
a
dozen
times
or
maybe
more
but
anyone
would
have
thought
it
was
as
new
to
them
as
to
me
it
seemed
as
if
i
were
sailing
in
a
dream
to
a
dream
land
and
everything
would
be
a
dream
till
i
found
myself
waking
up
at
home
if
anyone
had
pinched
me
i
hardly
believe
i
should
have
felt
it
as
i
stood
by
the
rail
while
we
steamed
towards
new
york
we
passed
a
big
fort
and
some
neat
little
houses
which
looked
like
quarters
there
were
long
island
and
coney
island
which
doremus
said
i
must
be
personally
conducted
to
see
some
day
when
i
felt
young
and
frivolous
and
by
and
by
i
heard
people
exclaiming
liberty
there
she
is
bless
the
dear
old
girl
while
i
was
wondering
whether
they
were
talking
of
a
lady
or
a
ship
i
caught
sight
of
a
majestic
giantess
obligingly
holding
a
torch
up
to
light
the
world
then
i
knew
it
was
the
statue
which
i
had
read
about
what
do
you
think
of
her
asked
doremus
she
a
i
said
now
i
know
why
your
girls
hold
themselves
so
well
they
trying
to
live
up
to
the
ideal
american
woman
but
she
is
as
big
as
i
thought
she
would
be
nothing
ever
is
as
big
as
you
think
it
going
to
be
especially
when
americans
have
told
you
about
it
for
one
has
been
brought
up
to
believe
that
their
big
things
are
bigger
than
anybody
else
in
the
whole
world
so
they
are
said
doremus
only
where
all
the
things
are
big
you
do
notice
them
for
the
high
grass
and
over
there
some
of
the
grass
he
pointed
and
i
saw
a
great
number
of
enormous
objects
shaped
like
chimneys
and
apparently
about
a
mile
high
scattered
aimlessly
along
the
horizon
which
was
a
brilliant
limpid
blue
what
are
they
i
asked
great
strange
factories
of
some
sort
no
houses
where
pretty
women
live
and
offices
where
men
make
the
money
for
them
to
live
on
you
must
be
joking
women
would
be
afraid
to
perch
up
there
in
the
sky
besides
it
would
take
too
long
to
go
up
and
down
nothing
takes
long
in
america
and
it
comes
natural
to
our
women
to
perch
up
high
statues
are
the
only
things
we
buy
pedestals
for
this
side
of
the
you
just
wait
and
see
i
do
need
to
wait
to
see
that
american
men
are
nice
to
women
said
i
perhaps
no
nicer
than
englishmen
really
only
you
seem
to
take
a
great
deal
more
trouble
fancy
all
the
men
at
van
der
table
drawing
lots
every
night
for
the
right
to
sit
by
her
and
the
two
miss
eastmans
i
do
believe
it
would
have
occurred
to
englishmen
the
ones
who
wanted
to
sit
there
would
have
tried
to
get
to
their
places
first
that
all
i
do
think
it
was
pretty
of
you
was
it
especially
supposing
none
of
us
particularly
wanted
but
never
mind
talking
of
pretty
things
here
are
the
docks
they
were
big
enough
to
satisfy
even
my
expectations
and
i
wished
that
i
insisted
on
being
taken
by
someone
long
ago
to
visit
the
london
docks
so
that
i
might
know
whether
ours
were
better
or
worse
one
never
thinks
of
going
to
see
things
at
home
but
i
began
to
suspect
that
i
might
some
day
be
stabbed
with
jealous
pangs
and
need
to
be
stuffed
with
a
lot
of
facts
about
england
though
until
i
knew
americans
i
been
in
the
habit
of
thinking
facts
the
least
interesting
things
in
the
world
they
seemed
like
chairs
to
sit
on
or
floors
to
walk
on
without
noticing
what
you
were
doing
but
i
suppose
it
might
be
awkward
without
chairs
and
floors
soon
we
were
near
enough
to
new
york
to
see
the
tremendous
chimney
things
clearly
and
they
sharpened
the
impression
that
i
was
sailing
straight
into
a
dream
there
could
be
no
such
things
in
the
real
world
they
would
be
possible
but
the
dream
felt
very
interesting
and
intense
all
of
a
sudden
and
i
did
want
to
wake
up
from
it
just
then
in
spite
of
ess
kay
the
tall
shapes
were
bright
and
vivid
now
as
giant
hollyhocks
growing
in
irregular
rows
still
they
did
not
look
one
bit
like
houses
or
offices
where
people
could
work
without
going
stark
staring
mad
i
got
a
queer
idea
in
my
head
that
the
houses
themselves
must
be
buried
deep
underground
like
bulbs
with
only
their
towers
sticking
up
the
next
thing
that
happened
in
the
dream
was
slowing
majestically
into
our
own
dock
and
that
was
wonderful
the
whole
place
was
alive
with
faces
mostly
pretty
girls
faces
under
fascinating
hats
gay
as
flowers
in
a
parterre
above
parterre
of
brilliant
blossoms
and
they
had
all
been
grown
in
honour
of
us
there
was
a
wild
waving
of
handkerchiefs
on
the
ship
and
a
frantic
fluttering
of
white
among
the
flowers
as
if
a
flock
of
butterflies
had
been
frightened
up
into
the
air
still
we
were
a
long
time
getting
in
and
i
grew
quite
impatient
but
finally
louise
who
had
attended
to
my
packing
took
charge
of
my
handbag
my
sunshade
and
coat
with
her
mistress
and
miss
woodburn
things
the
moment
had
come
to
bid
the
ship
now
said
ess
kay
slipping
her
arm
into
mine
i
wonder
dear
child
if
you
would
mind
being
left
alone
to
deal
with
the
people
you
stand
under
your
own
letter
of
course
oh
katherine
do
you
think
even
letter
b
which
sounds
so
like
a
warning
to
young
men
a
proper
chaperon
for
a
duchess
daughter
exclaimed
sally
woodburn
i
laughed
but
ess
kay
did
she
evidently
considers
things
connected
with
the
american
custom
house
no
fit
subject
for
frivolity
she
went
on
without
answering
i
under
and
sally
both
have
all
we
can
attend
to
wrestling
with
our
own
fiends
and
louise
will
be
just
as
busy
but
you
a
british
subject
on
a
short
visit
to
this
country
and
they
wo
be
as
diabolical
to
you
dear
i
did
all
the
swearing
necessary
for
you
in
the
saloon
with
my
own
when
the
tiresome
man
came
on
board
and
there
really
nothing
left
for
you
to
bother
with
on
the
dock
except
to
open
your
boxes
and
say
you
have
nothing
to
declare
i
was
glad
that
since
profanity
had
been
called
for
in
the
saloon
owing
to
the
tiresomeness
of
a
man
it
had
been
ess
kay
who
was
obliged
to
give
vent
to
it
not
i
but
i
felt
rather
defrauded
that
i
could
have
heard
and
i
wondered
if
she
had
gone
so
far
as
to
mention
damn
all
i
said
out
loud
however
was
that
i
was
sure
i
could
manage
very
well
in
the
docks
and
ess
kay
appeared
much
relieved
that
perfectly
sweet
of
you
betty
she
said
launching
a
daggery
glance
at
poor
inoffensive
sally
for
some
reason
which
i
could
understand
i
hope
you
wo
think
i
horrid
not
to
have
asked
you
to
label
your
baggage
so
it
could
go
with
mine
better
not
for
concerned
i
explain
afterwards
and
louise
shall
take
you
to
louise
did
take
me
to
b
which
they
had
thoughtfully
printed
very
large
and
black
on
a
wooden
wall
of
the
dock
in
a
row
with
all
the
other
letters
of
the
alphabet
a
good
many
people
from
the
ship
were
collecting
beneath
theirs
as
if
they
were
animals
getting
ready
to
join
the
procession
for
the
ark
under
the
heading
of
cat
or
elephant
as
the
case
might
be
and
they
all
seemed
worried
and
apprehensive
as
you
do
at
the
dentist
even
when
you
try
to
distract
your
mind
by
looking
at
the
pictures
in
louise
put
my
bag
on
the
wooden
floor
and
folded
my
coat
on
it
miladi
will
do
well
to
sit
down
said
she
it
may
be
that
the
baggage
do
not
come
with
this
she
bustled
away
to
the
louise
rabbit
warren
wherever
it
was
leaving
me
to
the
tender
mercies
of
fellow
b
who
began
to
swarm
round
me
and
buzz
distractedly
i
subsided
on
the
bag
which
was
very
like
sitting
on
the
floor
but
it
was
stifling
down
there
among
people
feet
besides
mine
soon
got
pins
and
needles
so
presently
i
popped
up
like
a
jack
out
of
his
box
and
almost
knocked
off
a
man
nose
with
the
crown
of
my
hat
i
said
i
your
pardon
though
what
the
nose
was
doing
so
near
the
top
of
my
head
i
could
conceive
until
its
owner
fumbling
with
one
hand
for
his
handkerchief
to
staunch
a
drop
of
blood
and
snatching
off
his
straw
hat
with
the
other
already
full
of
notebooks
and
things
blurted
out
abruptly
are
you
lady
bulkeley
i
surprised
no
said
i
i
lady
betty
bulkeley
that
all
right
said
the
nose
man
as
if
he
forgave
me
for
being
myself
i
did
know
but
you
want
to
be
called
lady
bulkeley
by
strangers
it
is
my
name
i
said
more
puzzled
than
ever
i
would
have
tried
to
be
dignified
as
he
was
a
young
man
in
an
alpaca
coat
but
when
you
have
just
made
a
person
nose
bleed
with
your
hat
it
would
seem
unfeeling
to
be
too
frigid
though
i
believe
an
application
of
ice
is
supposed
to
be
beneficial
shall
i
call
you
lady
betty
then
asked
the
man
patting
his
nose
with
his
handkerchief
which
luckily
for
my
nerves
had
already
a
pattern
of
pink
dots
on
it
i
do
see
why
you
should
call
me
anything
said
i
with
that
he
produced
a
card
with
a
whole
string
of
words
printed
on
it
and
poked
it
under
my
eyes
i
was
just
going
to
introduce
myself
he
said
i
represent
new
york
and
i
been
sent
by
my
paper
to
get
something
from
you
if
you
oblige
me
something
from
me
i
repeated
bewildered
is
it
anything
to
do
with
the
customs
i
nothing
to
declare
just
tell
me
please
something
about
your
family
your
brother
the
duke
of
stanforth
is
he
he
pronounced
it
dook
yes
but
thanks
young
and
unmarried
is
he
yes
but
ever
been
on
this
side
no
but
he
come
some
day
wo
he
most
unmarried
dukes
do
i
do
know
i
sure
really
i
think
excuse
me
you
going
to
stay
with
i
believe
will
you
make
a
lengthy
visit
i
do
you
must
have
met
one
or
two
of
our
smartest
young
men
on
board
what
do
you
think
of
them
as
compared
with
englishmen
long
before
this
i
had
made
up
my
mind
that
he
could
have
anything
to
do
with
the
customs
or
if
he
did
that
it
was
no
wonder
ess
kay
had
been
driven
to
swearing
in
the
saloon
i
was
glad
now
that
his
nose
was
bleeding
and
i
turned
my
back
upon
him
because
it
was
the
most
emphatic
gesture
i
could
think
of
but
as
i
faced
round
the
other
way
wondering
if
my
luggage
would
ever
come
another
man
pushed
through
the
b
who
had
got
their
boxes
and
almost
bounded
into
a
foot
of
unoccupied
space
in
front
of
me
lady
bulkeley
he
shot
at
me
like
history
repeating
itself
only
he
pronounced
me
as
if
my
name
were
founded
on
my
size
and
weight
this
time
i
did
answer
i
simply
stood
at
bay
and
stared
trying
to
look
as
much
like
mother
as
possible
but
the
new
man
did
seem
to
mind
this
in
the
least
so
apparently
my
effort
was
not
a
success
i
evening
he
remarked
hurriedly
with
an
air
of
valuing
his
time
at
so
much
a
second
i
was
sorry
he
was
a
bat
for
i
always
been
fond
of
bats
they
are
such
soft
grey
velvet
things
and
i
should
have
liked
to
tell
him
that
he
was
much
more
like
a
chicken
hawk
only
that
would
have
been
vulgar
and
besides
i
did
intend
to
pose
as
chicken
to
his
hawk
by
way
of
not
letting
myself
be
gobbled
up
i
remained
silent
but
i
could
help
starting
when
a
voice
behind
me
exclaimed
ah
there
my
chappie
you
welcome
to
the
milk
i
skimmed
off
the
cream
ta
ta
it
was
the
flashing
at
the
the
creature
was
not
blinded
however
he
seemed
difficult
to
disconcert
the
only
response
he
made
was
to
grin
and
push
his
hat
a
little
farther
back
on
his
head
an
inch
more
and
it
must
have
slid
down
over
his
collar
which
was
so
low
in
the
neck
in
front
that
it
gave
me
the
creeps
there
plenty
of
milk
and
roses
too
i
guess
said
he
staring
in
such
a
way
that
i
blushed
and
was
vexed
with
myself
for
blushing
i
peered
anxiously
about
hoping
to
see
a
face
i
knew
even
ever
so
slightly
which
might
be
summoned
to
the
rescue
but
all
the
b
were
passionately
minding
their
own
business
and
while
i
was
wishing
that
doremus
began
with
a
b
instead
of
a
d
i
caught
the
eyes
of
a
man
looking
straight
at
me
the
very
nicest
eyes
and
with
an
expression
in
them
that
filled
me
with
joy
they
said
do
let
me
come
and
get
rid
of
that
fellow
for
you
and
mine
said
yes
yes
yes
please
come
at
once
so
the
eyes
came
without
waiting
for
more
and
it
was
the
hero
of
the
steerage
who
brought
them
that
was
the
reason
i
telegraphed
yes
yes
for
i
thought
he
saved
a
little
boy
why
should
i
trust
him
without
an
introduction
to
save
me
look
here
said
the
bronze
man
to
the
i
got
just
five
minutes
to
spare
you
can
have
them
if
you
like
the
looked
at
him
crossly
at
first
then
his
sharp
little
face
seemed
turning
into
a
point
of
admiration
by
he
ejaculated
goods
will
get
the
preference
over
british
this
time
duty
or
duty
i
could
think
what
either
of
them
meant
though
at
first
i
was
afraid
my
man
intended
the
other
to
understand
that
the
five
minutes
would
be
devoted
to
knocking
him
down
or
something
else
violent
as
a
punishment
for
impertinence
to
a
defenceless
foreigner
but
my
mind
was
almost
instantly
relieved
for
the
two
men
walked
off
together
quite
amicably
and
stood
talking
at
a
distance
a
moment
later
one
of
my
boxes
went
by
looking
very
fat
and
friendly
on
the
shoulders
of
a
porter
who
apparently
had
no
head
i
rushed
out
and
seized
it
not
the
head
but
the
box
so
there
was
something
encouraging
but
i
had
two
pieces
of
luggage
to
wait
for
still
most
of
the
other
b
were
more
fortunate
about
getting
their
things
nevertheless
they
seemed
far
from
easy
in
their
minds
and
though
they
protested
almost
tearfully
that
they
nothing
whatever
to
declare
stern
persons
in
uniform
stirred
up
their
boxes
as
i
used
to
do
with
the
nursery
pudding
when
all
the
plums
had
sunk
to
the
bottom
i
was
very
tired
and
very
hot
hotter
than
i
supposed
people
could
be
except
in
a
turkish
bath
and
i
was
beginning
to
be
hungry
too
for
i
lunched
principally
off
the
statue
of
liberty
and
which
were
more
filling
than
lasting
as
a
meal
i
fanned
myself
with
my
handkerchief
as
well
as
i
could
and
felt
sure
i
was
slowly
getting
appendicitis
because
whenever
americans
feel
uncomfortable
in
any
way
it
seems
almost
certain
to
turn
eventually
into
that
probably
on
account
of
the
climate
would
my
other
boxes
come
i
thought
most
of
the
b
were
going
home
they
had
homes
lucky
people
and
if
they
liked
they
could
presently
have
tea
world
without
tea
ah
me
when
i
was
small
and
my
nurse
talked
on
sundays
about
heaven
and
hell
making
the
one
sound
incredibly
dull
the
other
incredibly
painful
i
used
to
think
that
i
rather
go
to
neither
but
just
be
stuffed
like
mother
blenheim
beau
brummel
whose
soul
i
fancied
had
leave
to
stop
in
his
body
so
long
as
moth
and
rust
did
not
corrupt
he
seemed
rather
out
of
things
though
poor
dear
standing
forever
in
the
same
position
in
a
glass
case
with
one
paw
up
begging
for
something
which
nobody
gave
while
the
years
dragged
on
and
i
begun
to
feel
as
if
i
were
falling
into
his
state
when
i
was
roused
from
a
stupid
dream
by
the
man
of
the
steerage
suddenly
looming
over
me
i
beg
your
pardon
said
he
taking
off
his
hat
and
speaking
in
a
nice
american
voice
as
nice
for
a
man
as
sally
woodburn
is
for
a
woman
please
do
suppose
i
mean
to
be
rude
or
intrusive
but
i
wanted
to
tell
you
that
i
think
you
wo
be
annoyed
again
and
just
one
thing
more
may
i
thank
you
for
your
goodness
on
shipboard
it
brightened
what
would
otherwise
have
been
a
grim
experience
blind
ess
kay
to
pronounce
this
man
not
a
gentleman
just
because
some
strange
circumstances
had
forced
him
to
travel
in
the
steerage
i
did
wish
that
without
his
knowing
it
i
could
have
slipped
into
his
pocket
my
thirty
pounds
oh
i
did
nothing
i
answered
it
was
the
other
people
who
did
everything
the
little
that
was
done
it
i
who
have
to
thank
you
for
taking
that
person
away
he
and
the
other
who
came
just
before
were
so
rude
they
did
mean
to
be
rude
he
said
they
wanted
you
to
tell
them
something
which
they
could
put
into
their
papers
and
they
live
by
doing
that
kind
of
thing
i
did
the
best
i
could
with
them
but
i
wish
i
could
have
saved
you
from
being
annoyed
in
the
beginning
i
hesitated
at
first
for
fear
you
might
misunderstand
and
think
me
as
bad
as
they
were
but
i
wish
i
had
now
after
what
i
saw
you
do
at
sea
i
could
possibly
have
misunderstood
i
said
thank
you
for
saying
that
he
returned
though
for
what
i
did
then
i
do
deserve
any
praise
it
was
done
on
the
impulse
and
i
used
to
salt
water
as
a
child
i
lived
close
to
it
for
a
time
in
california
and
swimming
came
almost
as
natural
as
walking
but
i
not
here
to
talk
about
myself
it
was
only
to
tell
you
how
grateful
i
was
and
am
and
shall
continue
to
be
for
your
kindness
on
the
ship
i
could
go
without
speaking
of
this
and
there
something
now
i
like
to
ask
you
wo
be
offended
if
it
something
you
want
to
tell
me
i
know
it
is
the
sort
of
thing
which
could
offend
i
said
but
i
did
say
it
as
calmly
as
it
looks
when
written
i
stammered
a
little
and
got
the
words
tangled
up
and
i
felt
my
face
growing
hotter
than
ever
i
thank
you
again
it
only
this
if
while
you
over
on
this
side
the
water
there
ever
any
way
in
which
a
man
a
man
who
be
as
respectful
as
your
footman
and
loyal
as
your
friend
could
possibly
serve
you
i
wish
you
would
let
me
be
that
man
i
know
it
seems
now
as
if
such
a
thing
could
happen
but
nothing
quite
impossible
in
this
queer
world
and
and
anyhow
i
shall
always
be
ready
you
could
trust
me
i
know
that
i
could
resist
breaking
in
i
employed
for
the
present
at
a
club
in
new
york
if
you
send
word
to
jim
brett
at
the
manhattan
club
there
nothing
under
the
sun
that
jim
brett
would
do
for
you
from
finding
a
lost
dog
to
taking
a
message
across
the
world
first
i
must
catch
my
dog
before
i
can
lose
him
i
answered
laughing
but
if
i
do
or
or
there
anything
else
i
sha
forget
that
a
true
promise
then
and
i
have
to
thank
you
for
the
third
time
now
i
not
going
to
trouble
you
any
longer
without
stopping
to
think
who
he
was
or
who
i
was
i
held
out
my
hand
and
his
brown
face
grew
red
he
took
the
hand
pressed
it
hard
once
dropped
it
abruptly
turned
on
his
heel
and
walked
away
without
looking
back
i
was
so
interested
in
going
over
the
conversation
in
my
mind
that
i
forgot
to
feel
like
beau
brummel
with
one
paw
up
in
his
glass
case
and
though
i
daresay
ten
minutes
had
passed
it
hardly
seemed
two
when
a
wonderful
little
black
image
in
the
shape
of
a
boy
came
sidling
up
to
me
all
rolling
white
eyes
and
red
grin
like
a
nice
newfoundland
puppy
he
had
some
newspapers
tucked
under
his
arm
but
in
his
hand
was
a
small
basket
of
peaches
almost
too
beautiful
to
be
real
but
then
were
they
and
was
he
part
of
my
dream
he
grinned
so
much
more
that
i
was
afraid
his
round
black
face
would
break
into
two
separate
halves
and
looking
at
me
with
his
woolly
head
on
one
side
he
thrust
out
the
basket
fur
you
missy
said
he
with
a
funny
little
accent
for
all
the
world
like
sally
woodburn
they
ca
be
for
me
there
must
be
a
mistake
said
i
wishing
there
was
for
the
peaches
did
look
delicious
and
there
were
two
rosebuds
lying
on
top
of
the
basket
one
pink
the
other
white
i
do
know
anyone
who
could
have
sent
them
the
gent
knows
you
you
bet
missy
replied
the
image
he
guv
me
a
quarter
and
axed
if
i
know
my
alphabet
to
find
letter
tote
dese
yere
to
the
prettiest
young
lady
i
ever
seed
most
wite
ladies
dey
looks
all
jes
alike
to
me
but
you
different
missy
an
i
reckon
de
tings
must
be
fur
you
i
had
a
horrible
vision
of
this
compliment
proceeding
from
or
evening
what
was
the
gentleman
like
i
asked
like
mos
any
gent
missy
that
he
was
powerful
tall
an
i
reckon
if
he
keeps
right
on
like
he
doin
now
he
get
mos
as
brown
as
me
some
day
then
i
knew
that
i
was
safe
in
taking
the
present
so
i
did
and
gave
the
comical
black
image
two
or
three
little
round
white
metal
things
i
got
from
the
purser
when
i
changed
some
english
money
i
know
how
much
they
were
and
they
looked
ridiculously
small
but
he
seemed
pleased
when
he
had
run
off
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
peaches
they
were
so
big
that
there
was
room
only
for
four
in
the
basket
and
they
seemed
dreadfully
pathetic
considering
from
whom
they
had
come
that
poor
fellow
must
be
almost
penniless
or
he
would
have
been
in
the
steerage
yet
he
had
bought
peaches
for
me
and
given
a
quarter
whatever
that
was
to
his
quaint
black
doll
of
a
messenger
i
could
have
cried
nevertheless
i
ate
two
of
the
peaches
and
reluctantly
presented
the
other
two
which
i
could
possibly
eat
to
a
gloomy
b
child
sitting
on
a
as
if
for
a
reward
of
virtue
just
as
i
had
disposed
of
my
leavings
and
stuck
the
roses
into
my
belt
the
last
of
the
luggage
arrived
there
were
two
custom
house
men
near
to
choose
from
and
as
i
heard
in
choosing
between
two
evils
it
better
to
choose
the
less
i
smiled
beseechingly
at
the
smaller
man
who
had
just
crammed
a
pile
of
lace
blouses
into
the
box
of
a
lady
with
nervous
prostration
whether
he
was
sated
with
cruelty
or
whether
he
was
naturally
of
an
angelic
disposition
i
shall
probably
never
know
now
but
the
fact
remains
that
instead
of
turning
out
the
fiend
i
been
led
to
expect
he
was
one
of
the
most
considerate
men
i
ever
met
he
would
even
let
me
unlock
my
own
boxes
but
took
the
keys
and
opened
them
for
me
himself
did
an
executioner
braid
the
hair
of
some
queen
whose
head
he
was
going
to
chop
off
i
must
look
the
incident
up
when
i
have
time
anyway
i
thought
of
it
when
the
custom
house
man
was
being
so
polite
but
the
analogy
did
go
any
farther
for
my
head
never
came
off
at
all
and
two
of
the
boxes
remained
unopened
you
english
are
you
he
asked
and
when
i
said
yes
and
that
i
was
only
on
a
short
visit
he
treated
my
belongings
as
if
they
were
sacred
if
he
disturbed
anything
he
laid
it
back
nicely
keeping
up
a
running
conversation
as
he
went
on
i
told
him
that
englishwomen
might
bring
home
all
the
pretty
clothes
they
liked
from
other
countries
and
that
i
considered
it
most
ungallant
in
such
a
chivalrous
nation
as
america
to
deny
ladies
a
few
paris
dresses
do
you
happen
to
know
miss
what
the
in
your
country
he
asked
tenderly
putting
back
some
yellow
hairpins
which
had
fallen
out
of
a
box
of
mine
dear
me
no
i
exclaimed
but
i
think
it
sometimes
more
than
a
shilling
in
the
pound
i
heard
my
brother
say
so
and
as
for
the
death
duties
it
more
than
your
life
worth
to
die
said
the
nice
man
we
have
got
any
on
this
side
and
folks
can
die
in
peace
whenever
they
please
i
guess
that
kind
of
evens
things
up
do
it
i
did
know
what
to
answer
so
i
thanked
him
for
his
kindness
and
we
parted
the
best
of
friends
ess
kay
appeared
so
quickly
afterwards
that
it
almost
seemed
as
if
she
must
have
been
lying
in
wait
she
was
looking
pale
and
shattered
and
louise
following
close
behind
was
positively
haggard
only
sally
had
weathered
the
storm
without
being
outwardly
the
worse
for
wear
but
even
she
did
look
as
as
usual
how
have
you
got
along
you
poor
deserted
darling
affectionately
enquired
ess
kay
undismayed
by
a
fixed
gaze
from
sally
which
apparently
signified
reproach
it
was
very
bad
and
i
quite
enjoyed
myself
i
replied
forgetting
some
tedious
moments
in
the
light
of
others
not
tedious
and
hoping
that
the
roses
in
my
belt
might
pass
unnoticed
fortunately
they
did
otherwise
i
should
have
been
in
a
difficulty
for
i
should
have
hated
to
vulgarise
the
little
episode
by
putting
it
into
story
form
for
ess
kay
and
presumably
roses
have
not
been
taught
to
grow
wild
on
the
new
york
docks
although
they
say
americans
are
so
very
luxurious
in
their
tastes
one
would
hardly
be
surprised
at
anything
a
beautiful
electric
carriage
bigger
than
a
brougham
was
waiting
for
us
and
we
left
louise
with
a
butler
or
some
other
man
servant
out
of
livery
to
wrestle
with
the
luggage
and
bring
it
in
cabs
which
they
called
hacks
up
to
ess
kay
house
in
new
york
where
i
knew
she
meant
to
stop
for
a
few
days
before
going
on
to
newport
the
minute
we
drove
away
from
the
docks
i
began
to
notice
dozens
of
things
which
made
me
tremendously
conscious
that
i
was
in
a
foreign
country
one
would
think
as
so
many
of
these
people
were
english
or
anyway
british
before
they
were
americans
that
their
buildings
and
everything
else
would
be
enough
like
to
remind
one
of
home
but
each
street
we
turned
into
showed
me
that
this
is
at
all
true
in
new
york
there
are
bits
like
paris
at
least
you
think
so
on
a
superficial
glance
but
nothing
in
the
faintest
degree
like
london
something
in
the
air
too
made
me
feel
excited
as
it
does
in
paris
sparks
of
electricity
snapped
in
my
veins
and
i
had
a
presentiment
of
interesting
things
that
must
surely
happen
i
always
been
very
sensitive
to
smells
which
can
make
me
joyful
or
miserable
just
as
music
does
vic
says
i
ought
to
tell
people
this
as
it
signifies
i
still
in
close
touch
with
brute
creation
but
i
do
much
mind
if
i
am
for
so
many
animals
are
nicer
than
we
are
dogs
and
horses
for
instance
and
then
one
has
to
acknowledge
whether
one
likes
or
not
that
a
monkey
is
a
kind
of
poor
relation
each
place
i
ever
visited
has
its
own
smell
for
me
and
even
houses
and
people
i
would
know
the
smell
of
battlemead
towers
if
i
were
taken
there
by
winding
ways
with
my
eyes
blindfolded
it
the
smell
of
old
oak
and
and
books
and
chintz
and
autumn
leaves
and
pine
trees
mixed
together
mother
smells
like
a
tea
rose
and
vic
like
a
wax
doll
london
has
a
rich
heavy
scent
which
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
had
a
great
deal
of
money
and
wanted
to
spend
it
but
not
in
a
hurry
the
smell
of
paris
makes
you
want
to
laugh
and
clap
your
hands
and
go
to
the
theatre
the
smell
of
rome
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
wished
to
be
very
beautiful
and
move
to
the
slow
accompaniment
of
a
magnificent
church
organ
with
the
vox
humana
stop
drawn
out
but
new
york
the
smell
of
new
york
how
shall
i
describe
the
sensation
it
gave
me
as
ess
kay
electric
carriage
smoothly
spun
me
up
town
the
heavy
feeling
of
homesickness
which
i
had
had
on
the
ship
for
the
last
few
days
was
gone
and
instead
i
felt
a
wild
sense
of
exhilaration
as
if
i
come
dashing
home
after
a
glorious
run
with
the
hounds
and
plunged
into
a
cold
bath
with
two
bottles
of
eau
de
cologne
poured
into
the
water
it
was
amazingly
hot
but
the
breeze
gave
a
hint
of
the
sea
and
every
shop
and
house
we
passed
seemed
to
keep
spices
stored
away
for
the
breeze
to
blow
over
even
the
houses
no
higher
than
those
in
london
were
as
different
from
ours
as
possible
and
it
was
extraordinary
to
see
people
nicely
dressed
women
and
pretty
girls
perched
on
the
front
steps
under
awnings
without
so
much
as
a
lawn
between
them
and
the
street
persons
of
that
class
at
home
would
be
far
too
shy
to
lounge
about
and
be
stared
at
not
only
by
the
neighbours
but
by
twenty
strangers
a
minute
yet
here
they
sat
on
rugs
and
read
or
did
embroidery
or
swung
back
and
forth
in
chairs
that
rocked
like
cradles
paying
no
more
attention
to
the
passers
than
if
they
had
been
flies
by
and
by
we
came
out
of
the
quiet
streets
walled
in
with
monotonous
rows
of
red
brick
or
brown
stone
houses
into
a
scene
of
terror
it
was
a
street
too
but
what
a
street
i
thought
that
i
grown
accustomed
to
motoring
through
traffic
for
once
stan
took
me
in
his
panhard
all
the
way
from
battlemead
to
pall
mall
where
he
stood
me
a
very
jolly
luncheon
at
the
carlton
hotel
but
that
experience
was
nothing
to
this
i
felt
a
little
jumpy
with
stan
when
we
shot
between
omnibuses
in
a
space
which
looked
twice
too
narrow
and
once
when
i
thought
a
frightfully
tall
horse
was
going
to
bite
off
my
hat
but
i
soon
got
used
to
it
if
i
were
driven
every
day
of
my
life
for
a
year
through
this
terrible
street
in
new
york
though
i
should
be
no
more
used
to
it
on
the
last
day
than
on
the
first
the
only
change
in
me
at
the
end
of
that
time
would
be
in
my
hair
which
would
have
turned
snow
white
and
be
standing
up
permanently
all
over
my
head
like
only
worse
london
roars
a
monotonous
roar
with
just
a
light
tinkle
of
hansom
cabs
sprinkled
over
the
top
of
the
solid
sound
but
that
great
straight
street
into
which
we
suddenly
flashed
had
no
solid
sound
it
shrieked
in
short
sharp
yells
made
up
of
a
dozen
distinct
noises
each
one
louder
and
more
insistent
than
the
other
there
were
trams
and
tram
bells
and
motors
and
carriages
and
over
all
an
appalling
thunder
of
trains
rushing
to
and
fro
above
our
heads
on
lines
roofing
the
entire
street
built
upon
iron
stilts
every
minute
they
swooped
by
running
north
and
south
and
i
trembled
lest
they
should
leap
their
tracks
and
crush
us
into
powder
it
only
the
elevated
deah
said
sally
pitying
my
agitation
and
it
never
fallen
down
yet
so
i
do
believe
it
will
you
shall
take
a
ride
with
me
if
cousin
katherine
will
let
you
which
she
probably
wo
you
ca
think
what
fun
it
is
shooting
past
the
windows
of
the
houses
just
like
glancing
into
an
exciting
story
book
you
know
you
never
have
a
chance
to
finish
you
do
get
a
peep
into
tragedies
and
comedies
sometimes
my
goodness
i
exclaimed
i
thankful
i
do
have
to
live
in
one
of
those
houses
it
must
be
impossible
ever
to
take
a
bath
or
to
get
engaged
properly
fortunately
for
my
peace
of
mind
we
did
stop
very
long
in
that
fierce
street
but
cut
across
again
and
came
out
in
fifth
avenue
of
which
one
seems
to
be
born
knowing
a
little
more
than
of
other
streets
in
america
just
as
almost
everyone
in
english
novels
lives
in
park
lane
so
all
the
new
yorkers
you
read
of
live
in
fifth
avenue
and
i
should
have
been
disappointed
if
ess
kay
had
because
in
that
case
i
should
eventually
have
to
go
home
without
studying
home
life
in
the
states
from
the
right
standpoint
at
first
i
did
see
where
the
grand
houses
i
heard
of
kept
themselves
for
everywhere
were
smart
shops
and
public
buildings
and
so
close
now
that
we
could
put
down
our
sunshades
mountainous
the
shops
were
beautiful
though
ess
kay
apologised
for
them
by
saying
that
it
was
out
of
season
and
i
never
seen
so
much
brilliance
of
colour
or
variety
in
a
street
i
tried
to
search
for
the
cause
of
this
effect
but
i
could
define
it
perhaps
it
was
partly
the
clearness
of
the
atmosphere
but
there
was
a
great
deal
more
than
that
everything
you
passed
seemed
to
be
pink
or
pale
green
or
gold
or
ivory
white
or
ultramarine
blue
yet
when
you
really
thought
it
out
detail
by
detail
it
was
and
though
i
considered
the
awful
from
a
distance
spinning
along
at
their
feet
i
could
deny
them
a
fantastic
kind
of
attractiveness
at
our
rate
of
speed
i
had
to
wait
many
minutes
for
the
grand
fifth
avenue
houses
and
oh
poor
london
poor
dear
london
i
wanted
to
fly
back
and
tear
down
buckingham
palace
ess
kay
had
always
talked
about
her
new
york
home
which
made
it
sound
rather
small
and
modest
so
i
was
surprised
when
we
stopped
before
a
huge
square
pile
built
of
rough
brown
stones
so
nearly
the
colour
of
a
christmas
plum
pudding
that
it
made
me
hungrier
than
ever
to
look
at
it
the
house
is
trimmed
with
three
wide
bands
of
carving
made
of
the
same
kind
of
stone
and
there
are
carved
bronze
railings
and
lamps
on
the
porch
and
the
front
door
is
carved
too
like
the
door
of
a
cathedral
we
were
let
into
a
vestibule
all
coloured
mosaic
and
things
and
that
opened
into
a
big
square
garden
with
a
great
marble
fountain
playing
in
the
middle
i
never
saw
such
a
wonderful
place
in
my
life
but
until
i
got
used
to
it
i
could
help
feeling
that
it
was
more
like
a
splendid
foreign
hotel
than
a
mere
house
the
garden
is
a
real
garden
when
you
come
to
examine
it
for
it
paved
with
rare
stones
of
different
colours
like
the
jewels
in
aladdin
cave
but
all
round
the
fountain
beautiful
flowers
are
growing
and
pink
and
white
water
lilies
float
in
the
marble
basin
there
are
orange
trees
in
pots
and
a
forest
of
tall
palms
all
of
which
are
reflected
and
repeated
over
and
over
again
in
the
mirrors
of
which
the
walls
are
made
and
on
the
little
tables
standing
about
here
and
there
among
groups
of
inlaid
chairs
are
bowls
overflowing
with
roses
the
roof
is
a
skylight
over
which
creepers
have
been
trained
so
that
the
light
which
filters
through
is
a
lovely
green
no
doors
are
visible
at
first
glance
but
when
you
are
initiated
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
walk
up
to
the
find
a
gold
button
press
it
and
a
door
opens
into
a
room
as
marvellous
as
the
fountain
court
round
which
it
seems
all
the
rest
of
the
house
is
built
we
have
something
to
drink
here
said
ess
kay
before
we
take
off
our
things
so
we
all
sat
down
among
the
palms
and
orange
blossoms
and
a
delicious
sense
of
peace
after
storm
stole
over
us
with
the
coolness
and
the
green
dusk
and
the
perfume
of
flowers
i
supposed
that
something
to
drink
at
this
time
of
day
meant
tea
but
almost
immediately
a
footman
came
through
the
glass
wall
carrying
a
tray
with
nothing
on
it
except
tall
tumblers
there
were
straws
sticking
out
of
the
tumblers
and
as
the
man
moved
i
could
hear
a
faint
tinkle
of
ice
for
a
minute
i
was
bitterly
disappointed
because
the
thought
of
tea
had
supported
me
for
hours
but
when
i
tasted
the
stuff
in
my
glass
i
was
disappointed
any
longer
it
had
two
or
three
strawberries
some
bits
of
pineapple
and
a
white
grape
bobbing
about
on
top
and
it
was
full
of
chopped
ice
i
do
know
what
it
was
for
nobody
mentioned
it
name
and
i
was
ashamed
to
ask
lest
it
might
seem
too
ignorant
but
it
was
good
and
tasted
as
if
it
might
have
a
little
wine
in
it
mixed
with
fizzy
water
and
other
things
when
i
had
drunk
mine
i
felt
a
different
girl
quite
merry
and
so
friendly
towards
ess
kay
i
had
never
thought
her
such
a
nice
woman
i
laughed
at
almost
everything
that
she
and
sally
said
and
i
said
some
rather
funny
things
myself
still
i
not
sure
that
as
a
regular
thing
i
would
rather
have
tea
we
sat
resting
for
some
time
though
i
was
tired
at
all
now
i
could
have
run
a
mile
but
suddenly
i
felt
a
little
sleepy
and
i
was
glad
when
ess
kay
proposed
to
go
to
our
rooms
leaving
the
fountain
court
we
came
into
a
hall
hung
with
tapestry
and
from
it
a
wide
stairway
led
us
up
to
a
gallery
lighted
from
the
top
which
runs
all
round
the
house
with
the
doors
of
the
bedrooms
opening
off
from
it
mine
is
so
gorgeous
that
i
have
known
one
thoroughly
comfy
moment
in
it
since
i
came
except
at
night
when
i
asleep
one
would
think
as
battlemead
is
ranked
among
the
finest
old
tudor
places
in
england
and
people
come
on
thursdays
and
give
shillings
to
see
it
a
very
good
thing
for
us
though
it
extremely
inconvenient
as
it
pays
for
all
the
gardens
and
all
the
servants
wages
that
it
would
be
grander
than
quite
a
new
house
in
a
country
like
america
but
battlemead
in
its
palmiest
days
must
have
been
beside
ess
kay
home
in
new
york
our
grandest
bedroom
the
one
where
queen
elizabeth
slept
is
quite
a
dull
old
hole
compared
to
ess
kay
splendid
room
mine
at
home
has
all
the
furniture
covered
with
faded
chintz
and
the
curtains
are
made
of
plain
white
dimity
but
i
love
the
deep
window
seats
where
i
can
curl
up
among
cushions
with
a
cataract
of
roses
veiling
the
picture
of
the
terrace
with
its
stone
balustrade
the
the
two
white
peacocks
and
far
away
the
park
with
a
blue
mist
among
the
trees
and
i
have
learned
yet
to
love
my
beautiful
room
at
ess
kay
though
i
admire
it
immensely
admire
to
the
verge
of
awe
it
pink
and
white
and
silver
the
carpet
is
pink
and
feels
like
moss
as
you
step
the
wall
is
covered
with
pink
and
silver
brocade
except
where
there
are
panels
with
pictures
the
curtains
are
foamy
lace
with
the
pink
and
silver
brocade
falling
over
them
the
furniture
looks
as
if
it
were
made
of
ivory
there
a
mirror
in
three
parts
reaching
from
the
floor
half
way
to
the
ceiling
so
that
you
see
yourself
in
front
and
two
profiles
like
astral
bodies
things
which
i
always
wanted
to
cultivate
as
they
would
be
so
nice
for
trying
on
dresses
or
making
calls
on
dull
people
on
the
is
another
mirror
an
oval
one
framed
with
pink
roses
each
of
which
has
an
electric
light
hidden
in
its
heart
and
the
bedspread
is
of
pink
and
silver
brocade
to
match
the
hangings
with
a
large
hard
roll
like
an
ossified
bolster
at
the
top
i
believe
it
that
bed
more
than
anything
else
which
makes
me
feel
that
it
always
sunday
in
my
room
at
ess
kay
i
used
to
ruffly
pillows
and
a
plain
white
coverlet
smelling
of
lavender
on
which
i
can
flop
down
whenever
i
like
to
read
a
novel
or
to
have
a
nice
little
weep
but
there
no
flopping
on
this
gorgeous
pink
and
silver
expanse
and
it
small
consolation
to
know
that
no
queen
of
england
ever
had
one
as
handsome
ess
kay
and
sally
escorted
me
to
my
room
when
i
came
to
it
first
after
i
admired
everything
enough
to
satisfy
them
i
was
taken
to
see
the
bathroom
adjoining
and
then
a
kind
of
wardrobe
room
opening
out
of
that
i
was
almost
prostrated
by
the
magnificence
of
both
which
pleased
ess
kay
very
much
and
in
the
grand
wardrobe
room
smelling
deliciously
though
faintly
of
cedar
my
poor
boxes
already
arrived
looked
mean
and
insignificant
ess
kay
and
sally
huge
innovations
would
have
been
much
more
appropriate
than
my
which
had
been
squashed
into
deformity
under
heavier
things
in
the
hold
louise
was
on
the
scene
armed
with
my
keys
and
ess
kay
hear
of
letting
me
do
anything
myself
i
explain
why
i
had
to
desert
you
on
the
dock
she
said
or
perhaps
i
need
explain
if
you
watch
louise
unpacking
for
a
few
minutes
you
see
for
yourself
and
i
do
hope
sweet
child
that
you
excuse
my
taking
a
liberty
this
made
me
curious
louise
opened
one
of
my
boxes
which
had
been
labelled
not
wanted
and
i
could
hardly
believe
my
eyes
when
she
lifted
out
an
exquisite
chiffon
embroidered
with
sprays
of
golden
holly
and
berries
made
of
some
gleaming
red
jewel
why
there
been
some
extraordinary
mistake
i
exclaimed
that
ca
be
my
box
i
no
such
dress
i
know
love
but
i
said
ess
kay
and
thanks
to
you
i
got
it
and
several
others
through
without
paying
duty
i
thought
you
would
mind
you
such
a
dear
pet
and
it
been
an
accommodation
not
that
i
care
about
the
money
but
i
do
love
to
get
the
best
of
those
fiends
at
the
custom
house
and
i
for
once
you
see
it
was
like
this
when
louise
went
to
the
baggage
room
to
get
out
some
things
for
you
i
had
them
put
in
my
trunks
afterwards
and
some
of
my
dresses
changed
into
yours
as
your
frocks
had
all
been
worn
and
mine
had
i
told
louise
to
put
my
things
down
at
the
bottom
some
in
each
of
your
trunks
and
i
was
pretty
sure
the
man
touch
them
as
you
a
british
subject
i
trusted
to
luck
that
be
too
to
say
anything
and
give
me
away
if
you
saw
the
dresses
while
your
trunks
were
being
examined
but
i
just
he
dig
down
to
them
i
dared
not
tell
you
what
was
going
on
as
sally
said
i
ought
to
because
if
i
had
you
might
have
refused
or
else
spoiled
everything
by
being
if
you
been
with
me
the
fiends
might
have
caught
on
to
our
little
game
they
so
suspicious
but
where
you
were
they
never
suspected
any
connection
between
us
just
a
i
had
been
a
dear
in
spite
of
myself
but
there
was
no
use
in
making
a
fuss
now
the
dearness
was
all
over
whatever
i
might
have
done
if
known
beforehand
that
i
was
to
be
a
perhaps
if
i
been
given
the
iced
stuff
with
the
strawberries
i
might
have
been
crosser
but
fortified
by
that
i
lived
up
to
my
reputation
as
a
dear
during
the
half
hour
of
the
unpacking
when
my
frocks
all
hung
in
a
row
like
bluebeard
wives
in
the
cedar
wardrobe
and
i
was
left
alone
with
them
at
last
my
first
thought
was
to
plunge
my
imprisoned
roses
in
water
my
second
to
do
the
same
with
myself
the
hope
of
tea
which
had
been
fulfilled
and
a
bath
had
kept
me
alive
through
those
two
hot
hours
on
the
dock
and
now
i
could
choose
between
several
kinds
of
bath
each
one
more
luxurious
than
any
i
had
ever
known
at
home
there
either
the
big
bath
in
the
bathroom
or
there
a
tub
in
your
bedroom
so
it
does
take
you
long
to
make
up
your
mind
which
you
will
have
but
here
there
were
so
many
things
i
could
do
that
i
grew
quite
confused
among
them
there
was
the
big
bath
so
big
that
two
of
our
big
ones
at
battlemead
could
have
gone
into
it
and
instead
of
climbing
ignominiously
in
in
the
ordinary
way
you
walked
down
several
glittering
white
marble
steps
it
was
very
alluring
but
as
the
marble
tank
was
so
vast
i
feared
i
might
have
to
spend
all
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
in
getting
it
full
of
water
it
seemed
impertinent
to
make
a
convenience
of
such
a
splendid
early
roman
sort
of
receptacle
for
a
mere
five
splash
a
bath
of
such
magnificence
ought
i
felt
to
be
what
americans
call
a
function
a
ceremony
for
which
you
would
prepare
with
perfumed
ointments
and
ambergris
and
protract
for
half
a
day
at
least
not
to
be
wasteful
then
there
was
the
vapour
bath
which
you
took
in
a
kind
of
box
with
a
hole
for
your
head
to
stick
out
a
porcelain
sitz
bath
and
a
mysterious
shower
bath
into
which
you
secretively
retired
behind
canvas
curtains
shaped
like
a
sentry
box
i
dared
not
try
the
vapour
for
fear
i
should
be
steamed
like
a
potato
the
sitz
seemed
as
inadequate
as
a
thwarted
ambition
and
to
turn
on
the
shower
without
knowing
how
much
it
could
do
or
how
soon
it
could
be
stopped
appeared
a
desperate
adventure
after
all
i
thought
it
was
less
worrying
with
us
here
whichever
thing
you
chose
you
would
probably
wish
you
had
had
the
other
whereas
at
home
you
did
what
you
could
and
were
perfectly
satisfied
i
decided
that
i
would
toss
up
a
coin
heads
the
big
marble
tank
tails
the
shower
it
came
tails
and
i
had
a
dreadful
qualm
but
one
must
be
sporting
so
i
was
only
the
hot
water
would
come
and
apparently
there
was
ice
in
the
cold
which
stop
coming
and
it
was
very
violent
i
screamed
once
and
ess
kay
and
sally
and
louise
ran
to
the
door
which
was
embarrassing
but
fortunately
i
locked
it
and
they
told
me
how
to
stop
the
iced
water
when
it
was
all
over
i
felt
like
a
marble
statue
for
hours
dinner
was
at
half
past
seven
which
seemed
odd
in
such
a
grand
palace
of
a
house
because
of
course
at
home
for
some
extraordinary
reason
unless
you
are
in
the
middle
classes
you
never
have
an
appetite
before
eight
at
the
very
earliest
if
you
in
france
or
other
countries
on
the
continent
you
can
be
hungry
sooner
and
evidently
it
is
the
same
in
america
perhaps
if
i
were
scientific
i
should
be
able
to
classify
these
differences
as
natural
phenomena
i
had
dressed
myself
early
and
was
ready
a
little
after
seven
because
i
thought
it
would
be
nice
to
sit
in
the
fountain
court
but
just
as
i
was
going
down
louise
knocked
at
the
door
i
have
come
to
help
miladi
and
to
bring
her
these
flowers
said
she
they
are
with
from
monsieur
the
lieutenant
parker
the
brother
of
madame
but
i
have
never
met
him
i
said
gazing
with
wonder
upon
a
group
bunch
is
too
mean
a
word
of
mammoth
pink
roses
with
thickly
leaved
stems
longer
than
walking
sticks
there
were
at
least
a
dozen
of
these
splendid
creatures
loosely
held
together
by
trails
of
pink
satin
ribbon
wide
enough
for
a
sash
i
had
never
dreamed
of
such
roses
i
almost
expected
them
to
speak
miladi
and
the
lieutenant
will
meet
at
dinner
explained
louise
it
is
an
american
custom
that
the
messieurs
send
always
flowers
to
the
ladies
madame
and
mademoiselle
woodburn
have
received
bouquets
also
but
these
roses
for
miladi
are
the
most
beautiful
is
it
miladi
wish
that
i
untie
the
ribbon
and
take
out
one
or
two
for
her
to
carry
i
was
on
the
point
of
saying
yes
because
the
flowers
were
so
lovely
and
because
it
would
please
ess
kay
but
on
second
thoughts
i
said
no
thanking
louise
and
asking
her
to
put
the
creatures
feet
in
water
perhaps
it
would
be
as
well
i
reminded
myself
to
see
this
brother
of
ess
kay
of
whose
existence
i
never
heard
before
i
went
about
armed
with
his
roses
i
had
already
tucked
the
white
bud
which
had
come
to
me
on
the
dock
like
a
dove
with
an
olive
branch
into
the
low
neck
of
my
frilly
white
muslin
frock
and
i
gave
it
no
rivals
has
madame
gone
down
i
asked
for
it
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
awkward
to
find
myself
alone
for
nearly
half
an
hour
with
a
strange
man
i
think
madame
will
be
in
the
hall
said
louise
and
satisfied
i
descended
in
a
stately
way
suited
to
the
house
into
the
fountain
court
nobody
was
there
however
except
a
young
man
in
evening
dress
who
jumped
up
from
a
chair
and
set
down
a
small
glass
out
of
which
he
had
been
drinking
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
said
he
i
know
you
must
be
lady
betty
bulkeley
my
name
is
potter
parker
i
could
help
wondering
whether
his
friends
called
him
pot
for
short
and
the
thought
made
me
smile
more
than
i
would
have
smiled
at
a
stranger
if
it
had
popped
into
my
head
this
seemed
to
encourage
him
which
i
regretted
because
you
can
see
at
once
by
his
face
that
he
is
the
kind
who
needs
encouragement
it
is
something
like
ess
kay
face
only
younger
with
her
square
chin
and
bold
blue
eyes
as
pale
as
hers
the
likeness
is
all
the
stronger
because
parker
wears
no
moustache
or
beard
and
his
dark
hair
which
falls
in
two
straight
thick
blocks
over
his
forehead
is
parted
in
the
middle
you
would
know
if
you
saw
him
riding
a
white
bear
at
the
north
pole
that
he
was
an
american
young
man
why
or
how
i
not
experienced
enough
in
americans
to
tell
but
i
beginning
to
think
that
all
american
men
and
all
american
women
have
a
dim
sort
of
family
likeness
to
each
other
with
the
girls
it
their
chins
and
the
way
they
do
their
hair
but
with
the
men
it
more
mysterious
they
look
less
lazy
and
more
feverish
than
our
men
yet
at
the
same
time
more
humorous
and
their
clothes
seem
always
to
be
new
ess
kay
nose
turns
down
and
her
brother
turns
up
which
is
the
principal
difference
in
their
features
and
his
makes
him
look
very
impudent
though
rather
clever
and
amusing
my
sister
wrote
me
about
your
dimples
lady
betty
said
he
when
i
smiled
and
i
screwed
my
mouth
into
prunes
and
prisms
as
quickly
as
i
could
i
should
have
thought
such
things
were
hardly
worth
writing
about
said
i
my
impression
is
that
they
worth
about
a
million
dollars
an
eighth
of
an
inch
he
replied
and
i
bet
they
fetch
that
in
a
bear
market
i
began
to
wish
that
ess
kay
or
sally
would
come
for
i
not
used
to
having
persons
who
have
just
introduced
themselves
make
remarks
on
my
dimples
or
other
features
do
be
mad
with
me
he
went
on
or
i
shall
think
i
estimated
them
too
low
on
mature
consideration
as
we
soldier
chaps
say
at
a
i
should
be
inclined
to
set
them
higher
if
you
just
show
them
again
i
think
if
you
do
mind
said
i
that
i
rather
speak
of
the
weather
i
afraid
you
not
used
to
americans
said
he
i
met
several
crossing
but
none
of
them
talked
to
me
about
such
things
i
replied
rather
primly
if
they
had
i
should
have
challenged
them
he
retorted
while
you
staying
with
my
sister
i
consider
myself
a
sort
of
guardian
of
yours
and
part
of
my
duty
will
be
to
keep
off
men
other
men
with
a
stick
you
see
no
i
do
see
said
i
not
that
there
will
be
the
least
necessity
for
you
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
oh
wo
there
well
you
just
wait
till
you
get
to
newport
and
you
find
out
differently
i
applied
for
leave
on
purpose
to
help
kath
protect
you
and
i
expect
to
put
on
a
suit
of
chain
armour
under
my
clothes
but
first
you
coming
to
visit
me
at
west
point
i
do
think
i
am
i
said
oh
but
you
are
it
a
promise
of
kath
and
sha
i
be
proud
to
show
you
around
you
shall
see
flirtation
walk
the
first
thing
what
the
ladies
admire
the
most
at
the
point
perhaps
you
heard
of
it
no
said
i
and
i
never
heard
of
west
point
is
it
a
suburb
of
new
york
not
much
it
our
american
sandhurst
but
you
english
people
know
anything
about
this
side
i
guess
now
you
think
that
florida
is
in
south
america
i
have
thought
about
it
yet
i
replied
that
right
i
do
ask
anything
better
than
to
teach
you
the
geography
of
the
united
states
we
begin
with
flirtation
walk
but
see
here
lady
betty
that
rose
you
got
on
is
a
good
sample
of
what
we
can
grow
over
here
did
that
maid
of
my
sister
take
you
something
a
little
better
from
me
something
much
bigger
and
grander
i
said
feeling
loyal
to
my
poor
white
bud
i
was
meaning
to
thank
you
do
do
that
the
things
are
worth
it
i
only
wanted
to
know
whether
that
french
female
had
played
me
false
or
not
but
here
comes
my
sister
i
wish
she
taken
longer
to
do
up
her
back
hair
now
give
you
your
wish
and
talk
about
the
weather
mighty
hot
day
it
wo
you
have
a
cocktail
i
just
finished
mine
when
you
came
down
of
course
betty
will
have
a
cocktail
we
all
do
before
dinner
said
ess
kay
sailing
towards
us
in
a
trailing
white
film
of
lace
but
betty
did
have
one
though
at
this
moment
several
little
glasses
appeared
on
a
tray
i
was
sure
that
mother
would
not
approve
of
cocktails
for
me
as
it
sounds
so
fast
for
a
young
girl
who
is
yet
out
when
i
excused
myself
ess
kay
laughed
and
said
then
what
about
that
sherry
cobbler
while
i
was
trying
to
think
what
she
meant
sally
came
into
the
hall
and
immediately
after
i
was
surprised
by
a
kind
of
musical
moaning
which
began
suddenly
and
kept
on
for
a
long
time
that
the
japanese
gong
said
ess
kay
when
i
looked
round
to
see
where
the
sound
came
from
it
for
dinner
potter
give
betty
your
arm
i
was
glad
she
did
use
that
nickname
i
been
thinking
of
for
if
she
had
i
should
certainly
have
laughed
we
began
dinner
by
eating
melons
cut
in
half
and
filled
with
chopped
ice
i
thought
at
first
that
it
must
be
a
mistake
and
they
ought
to
have
come
in
at
dessert
but
everybody
else
ate
theirs
without
appearing
disconcerted
so
i
did
mine
and
it
was
good
so
were
all
the
other
things
that
followed
in
a
long
procession
though
they
were
very
strange
and
some
of
them
i
should
have
known
how
to
eat
if
parker
whose
place
was
next
to
mine
had
told
me
we
had
bouillon
partly
frozen
instead
of
soup
and
then
came
the
most
extraordinary
little
fried
animals
which
quite
startled
me
they
were
so
like
exaggerated
brown
spiders
done
in
egg
and
breadcrumbs
soft
shell
crabs
dear
child
said
ess
kay
and
you
eat
every
bit
down
to
the
tippiest
end
of
his
claw
i
should
never
have
managed
the
green
corn
which
grows
like
lots
of
pearls
set
close
together
in
rows
on
a
fat
stick
if
parker
scraped
all
the
pearls
off
for
me
with
a
fork
and
put
butter
and
salt
on
them
i
liked
him
a
little
better
after
that
for
he
did
the
thing
with
great
skill
when
i
had
got
so
far
nothing
could
surprise
me
and
i
did
turn
a
hair
when
i
found
that
i
was
expected
to
eat
pears
cut
up
with
salad
oil
but
they
were
alligator
pears
and
when
you
tasted
them
it
appeared
that
they
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
fruit
kingdom
best
of
all
i
liked
the
watermelon
which
came
at
the
end
cut
in
little
balls
looking
like
strawberry
water
ice
and
soaked
in
champagne
i
hope
that
all
the
things
to
eat
in
america
wo
be
so
nice
or
i
may
grow
stout
before
i
go
back
and
vic
says
it
is
better
for
a
girl
to
hang
herself
it
was
very
trying
too
to
find
that
i
was
keeping
every
course
waiting
i
never
been
accused
of
greediness
at
home
though
often
been
made
to
feel
guilty
of
most
other
sins
in
the
calendar
but
i
did
feel
queer
when
i
began
to
realise
that
everybody
else
had
finished
what
was
on
their
plates
when
i
just
about
discovered
what
the
thing
was
it
made
me
so
uncomfortable
to
see
them
all
leaning
back
waiting
for
me
after
their
plates
had
been
whisked
away
that
i
took
to
bolting
the
rest
of
my
food
and
by
the
time
we
got
rid
of
nine
courses
in
about
half
an
hour
i
felt
qualified
to
write
the
autobiography
of
an
anaconda
as
for
the
iced
water
i
had
intended
to
refuse
it
at
any
cost
because
vic
and
mother
both
solemnly
warned
me
that
it
made
the
difference
between
a
complexion
and
mere
skin
but
the
minute
i
landed
i
began
thinking
hard
about
iced
water
and
i
soon
discovered
that
when
you
are
in
america
a
comparatively
small
consideration
like
a
complexion
would
never
keep
you
from
drinking
it
in
fact
nothing
would
you
feel
as
if
you
must
drink
iced
water
pints
of
iced
water
in
rapid
succession
if
not
only
your
complexion
but
your
whole
face
were
to
be
swept
away
in
the
deluge
once
you
have
got
the
taste
nothing
can
quench
it
but
iced
water
more
iced
water
and
still
more
iced
water
after
dinner
while
we
were
having
heavenly
turkish
coffee
in
the
fountain
court
who
should
come
but
doremus
it
seemed
to
me
a
funny
time
to
call
but
apparently
the
others
did
think
it
out
of
the
way
he
wanted
us
to
go
to
some
theatre
on
a
roof
and
i
should
have
loved
it
especially
when
ess
kay
said
you
did
get
smudges
on
your
nose
as
you
would
if
you
sat
on
a
roof
in
london
a
thing
which
i
never
heard
of
anybody
except
cats
doing
but
she
was
tired
and
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
ladylike
for
me
to
be
only
i
was
much
too
excited
so
doremus
stayed
and
he
and
parker
talked
more
slang
in
an
hour
than
i
think
i
ever
heard
in
my
whole
life
though
i
have
always
considered
stan
talented
in
that
way
but
stan
slang
and
vic
are
quite
different
from
american
slang
in
america
you
build
up
your
whole
conversation
out
of
it
and
wonderful
i
longed
for
a
notebook
while
those
two
men
were
talking
to
put
everything
down
and
i
felt
if
people
were
often
going
to
be
as
funny
as
that
i
should
need
to
go
home
soon
to
rest
my
features
not
sure
whether
americans
really
think
funnier
things
than
english
people
do
but
their
funny
ideas
are
startlingly
unlike
ours
somehow
they
seem
younger
and
more
bubbling
when
i
go
home
i
shall
probably
have
collected
so
much
slang
in
my
pores
that
i
shall
talk
about
putting
on
my
glad
rags
when
i
going
to
dress
for
dinner
my
life
will
be
my
natural
i
shall
call
stan
motor
car
the
blue
assassin
or
the
homicide
wagon
i
shall
say
my
best
frocks
are
mighty
conducive
i
shall
get
bored
by
poor
duckworth
our
newest
curate
and
tell
him
he
the
limit
i
may
even
take
to
abbreviating
my
affirmatives
and
negatives
by
saying
yep
and
nope
when
i
in
a
hurry
but
if
i
do
fall
into
these
ways
i
tremble
to
think
what
may
be
the
effect
on
mother
iv
about
shopping
and
men
why
betty
you
never
told
me
you
were
interviewed
on
the
dock
these
were
the
first
words
ess
kay
said
to
me
as
i
walked
in
to
breakfast
a
little
late
because
of
a
wrestle
i
had
had
with
a
different
and
even
more
exciting
kind
of
bath
i
was
said
i
on
the
defensive
though
i
could
be
perfectly
sure
what
connection
if
any
interviewing
had
with
the
customs
you
told
me
not
to
declare
anything
and
i
did
parker
looking
as
if
he
had
been
melted
poured
into
his
clothes
and
then
cooled
off
with
iced
water
burst
out
laughing
you
a
daisy
lady
betty
said
he
is
it
invidious
to
be
a
daisy
i
asked
i
guess
i
must
look
in
the
dictionary
for
but
a
daisy
a
flower
that
has
budded
in
the
green
fields
of
england
where
there
are
any
newspaper
reporters
or
other
strange
bugs
potter
exclaimed
ess
kay
do
tease
her
and
when
been
in
the
green
fields
of
england
you
say
not
er
what
you
say
if
you
do
want
ladies
to
faint
all
around
you
on
the
floor
then
she
turned
to
me
he
means
you
very
innocent
because
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
interviewed
but
you
must
have
it
all
the
same
for
see
here
in
this
dreadful
and
she
handed
me
a
newspaper
with
one
page
folded
over
and
huge
headings
dotted
about
at
the
tops
of
paragraphs
like
the
lines
of
big
print
that
oculists
keep
to
make
you
try
your
eyesight
in
the
middle
column
i
saw
my
name
but
i
could
believe
it
was
really
there
in
an
american
paper
i
began
to
think
i
was
awake
yet
and
that
this
must
be
part
of
the
dream
i
was
dreaming
all
yesterday
bonny
betty
bulkeley
i
read
out
aloud
a
duke
daughter
on
the
dock
call
her
by
her
front
name
please
what
lady
betty
thinks
of
our
boys
there
was
more
but
when
i
had
got
so
far
i
simply
gasped
how
they
there
is
much
they
do
dare
except
to
go
back
without
a
said
parker
laughing
but
i
did
laugh
i
was
too
angry
if
my
brother
were
here
he
kill
them
i
said
then
he
has
got
a
sense
of
humour
replied
parker
i
see
how
a
duke
could
have
and
be
a
duke
nowadays
but
i
guess
i
would
mind
swopping
my
sense
of
humour
for
a
dukedom
all
the
same
see
here
lady
betty
you
get
to
like
our
newspapers
before
been
over
here
a
month
they
sort
of
grow
on
you
they
as
interesting
as
novels
and
almost
as
true
to
life
this
is
true
to
my
life
anyway
i
said
not
knowing
whether
i
wanted
most
to
laugh
or
cry
oh
sally
sally
will
anybody
believe
i
said
such
things
as
these
give
the
to
me
and
let
me
look
she
said
and
when
taken
the
paper
she
began
to
read
the
stuff
that
came
under
the
big
headings
out
aloud
in
her
pretty
soft
voice
yesterday
was
a
blazer
but
though
it
was
hot
enough
on
the
docks
to
roast
a
coon
when
the
big
willie
steamed
in
that
beautiful
young
visitor
to
our
shores
lady
betty
bulkeley
managed
to
look
like
the
duke
daughter
and
duke
sister
she
is
and
so
far
as
a
mere
man
could
tell
without
the
help
of
patent
hair
curlers
or
other
artificial
aids
to
personal
pulchritude
a
daughter
of
the
gods
divinely
tall
and
most
divinely
fair
she
sat
on
a
throne
of
ducal
luggage
looking
queenly
in
an
elegant
white
shirt
waist
built
mostly
of
holes
and
eminently
suited
to
her
style
of
beauty
as
well
as
the
weather
she
also
had
on
a
picture
hat
which
was
superfluous
as
she
would
have
been
a
picture
without
it
and
below
the
waist
she
was
tailor
made
i
think
it
most
insulting
i
broke
in
and
i
was
made
at
home
all
the
way
down
but
sally
went
on
i
soon
found
writes
the
representative
of
that
the
sister
of
the
duke
of
stanforth
one
of
eligibles
preferred
to
be
addressed
by
her
front
name
of
lady
betty
feel
more
at
home
said
she
with
a
sweet
voice
but
a
pronounced
english
accent
i
am
called
lady
betty
and
i
want
to
feel
at
home
in
america
because
i
expect
to
be
some
time
with
my
friend
who
will
show
me
society
over
on
this
side
i
have
heard
so
much
about
newport
do
you
know
i
fancy
it
will
be
too
utterly
deevy
what
deevy
i
demanded
with
scorn
oh
that
supposed
to
be
what
smart
englishwomen
say
for
divine
never
heard
it
i
sneered
much
less
said
it
i
sure
mother
would
consider
it
quite
profane
well
do
be
quiet
child
and
listen
to
what
says
you
said
opinion
have
you
formed
of
our
society
women
and
clubmen
on
board
the
willie
was
the
next
question
think
your
ladies
are
better
dressed
than
ours
and
the
gentlemen
are
just
lovely
they
do
sit
around
and
wait
while
we
girls
amuse
them
they
hustle
to
give
us
a
good
time
and
they
know
how
to
do
it
i
should
wonder
if
i
should
hate
to
go
home
and
associate
with
lords
after
being
a
summer
girl
in
newport
i
do
see
now
why
american
girls
go
out
of
their
own
country
to
marry
suppose
we
shall
be
seeing
your
brother
the
duke
over
here
before
long
grace
may
come
to
fetch
me
back
replied
her
ladyship
has
never
been
to
america
but
it
is
one
of
the
desires
of
his
life
to
come
and
your
american
beauties
had
better
look
out
for
he
is
a
gay
young
bachelor
and
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
took
a
fancy
to
carry
home
a
duchess
will
entertain
him
also
and
maybe
he
will
paint
some
of
america
red
that
all
about
you
i
see
sally
finished
up
the
rest
is
about
cousin
katherine
and
me
it
says
we
come
back
with
a
touch
of
the
piccadilly
accent
and
it
criticises
my
nose
and
the
way
cousin
katherine
puts
on
her
hat
it
describes
this
house
all
wrong
and
says
the
newport
cottage
spots
out
of
van
der
windt
cottage
it
also
mentions
cousin
potter
and
calls
him
of
our
army
dudes
but
do
mind
and
you
must
everybody
reads
for
the
sake
of
the
shocks
but
nobody
believes
its
flashes
still
you
must
have
said
something
to
the
man
remarked
ess
kay
i
only
said
but
or
but
i
insisted
truly
and
truly
nothing
else
and
oh
there
was
a
too
who
tried
to
talk
to
me
great
scott
the
chortled
parker
look
out
for
something
rich
ca
he
be
stopped
i
asked
might
as
well
try
to
stop
niagara
with
a
tin
can
the
less
said
the
more
the
will
say
but
it
does
matter
care
reporters
are
paid
by
the
yard
for
imagination
gone
out
though
i
do
hear
you
use
it
still
on
your
side
i
was
just
going
to
defend
information
british
at
the
expense
of
imagination
american
when
i
remembered
that
the
army
dude
which
sounds
rather
like
something
you
might
buy
at
the
stores
had
sent
me
up
an
enormous
bouquet
of
violets
as
big
as
a
breakfast
plate
and
that
i
forgotten
to
thank
him
i
did
so
at
once
but
it
seemed
that
i
had
blundered
violets
he
echoed
must
have
been
some
other
fellow
i
sent
you
gardenias
oh
then
the
cards
got
mixed
i
said
i
thought
the
gardenias
were
from
doremus
how
kind
of
you
both
i
was
so
surprised
to
receive
such
lovely
flowers
our
american
buds
are
surprised
when
they
do
get
them
they
would
think
it
a
cold
day
when
they
did
have
a
slight
morning
haul
of
flowers
must
be
out
of
season
ones
or
they
no
use
new
novels
or
candy
what
do
men
over
on
your
side
of
the
water
do
to
convince
you
girls
that
they
think
you
as
beautiful
as
you
really
are
i
thought
for
a
minute
and
then
i
said
that
perhaps
we
were
as
hard
to
convince
as
american
girls
i
do
know
whether
this
was
a
proper
answer
or
not
but
anyway
parker
laughed
and
then
began
to
plan
what
we
should
do
for
the
day
say
let
run
her
over
to
coney
island
he
said
oh
my
dear
boy
exclaimed
ess
kay
not
for
anything
the
duchess
would
have
a
fi
i
mean
she
would
be
horrified
but
when
i
heard
that
coney
island
was
like
a
kind
of
glorified
margate
which
i
never
been
to
but
only
heard
about
with
switchbacks
and
all
sorts
of
shows
i
said
that
mother
would
consider
it
a
chapter
in
the
liberal
education
of
a
respectable
british
tourist
and
it
was
decided
that
we
should
dine
there
ess
kay
had
to
do
a
lot
of
things
before
she
could
go
on
to
newport
so
we
were
to
shop
all
the
morning
lunch
at
sherry
rest
in
the
afternoon
and
spend
the
evening
at
coney
island
next
day
we
were
to
go
to
west
point
where
parker
is
stationed
and
stay
there
all
night
for
a
cadet
ball
just
as
we
had
got
this
programme
settled
and
were
making
up
our
minds
to
go
out
early
while
it
was
cool
we
should
all
have
been
lying
about
with
wet
handkerchiefs
on
our
foreheads
at
home
and
there
would
have
been
special
prayers
in
church
if
it
had
ever
been
what
new
yorkers
seem
to
think
cool
the
butler
came
in
leading
by
a
leash
a
perfect
angel
of
a
dog
a
little
french
bull
with
skin
satiny
as
a
ripe
chestnut
and
eyes
like
rosettes
of
brown
velvet
with
diamonds
shining
through
them
he
had
on
a
spikey
silver
collar
fringed
on
each
edge
with
white
horsehair
and
he
came
trotting
into
the
room
with
a
high
action
of
his
paws
dainty
and
proud
like
a
horse
that
knows
on
show
and
his
tiny
head
was
cocked
on
one
side
as
if
he
were
asking
us
to
please
admire
him
and
be
his
friends
i
supposed
that
the
little
fellow
belonged
to
ess
kay
and
that
he
was
being
brought
in
to
bid
his
mistress
good
morning
but
she
said
quite
sharply
what
dog
is
that
he
a
parcel
said
the
butler
addressed
to
lady
betty
bulkeley
he
was
left
at
the
door
by
a
messenger
boy
and
the
on
his
collar
in
another
instant
that
little
live
warm
bundle
of
brindled
satin
sewed
on
to
steel
wires
was
in
my
lap
and
it
did
seem
as
if
he
knew
that
he
was
mine
the
queerest
thing
was
that
he
had
no
note
with
him
on
the
label
just
a
luggage
label
tied
on
his
collar
was
my
name
in
a
strange
but
very
interesting
looking
hand
and
these
words
besides
the
dog
is
now
found
his
name
is
vivace
who
sent
it
to
you
betty
asked
ess
kay
and
i
could
see
by
her
eyes
that
she
was
very
curious
i
had
just
answered
i
do
know
from
adam
when
some
words
of
my
own
jumped
into
my
head
i
could
hear
myself
saying
i
must
first
find
the
dog
and
then
i
knew
that
the
giver
of
vivace
was
adam
but
luckily
i
had
thought
before
i
spoke
so
it
was
no
harm
to
let
it
rest
at
that
and
i
just
sat
and
played
with
my
new
toy
while
ess
kay
and
her
brother
jabbered
about
him
excitedly
it
must
be
tom
doremus
said
she
he
the
only
man
i
let
you
know
well
enough
on
board
to
take
such
a
liberty
i
thought
of
another
man
she
had
wanted
to
let
me
know
but
i
rubbed
my
chin
on
vivace
ear
which
felt
like
a
and
kept
quiet
cheek
of
doremus
remarked
parker
he
a
josher
from
wayback
how
does
he
know
lady
betty
likes
dogs
i
should
send
the
little
brute
off
to
the
dogs
home
if
makes
me
do
that
i
shall
have
to
go
with
him
and
stop
with
him
too
said
i
and
i
almost
hated
parker
for
a
minute
in
spite
of
the
roses
and
the
snowstorm
of
gardenias
upstairs
of
course
you
shall
keep
the
dog
if
you
want
to
said
ess
kay
unless
we
find
out
that
he
been
sent
by
someone
undesirable
and
then
of
course
the
duchess
would
expect
me
to
see
that
you
gave
him
back
i
somehow
that
we
shall
never
find
out
i
said
and
i
hugged
vivace
so
hard
without
meaning
to
that
he
gave
a
tiny
grunt
but
he
did
mind
a
bit
and
licked
my
hand
with
a
tongue
that
was
like
a
sweet
little
sample
of
pink
plush
i
was
suddenly
so
happy
with
my
that
i
forgave
america
for
having
imaginative
reporters
and
was
homesick
for
the
pony
or
for
berengaria
and
her
puppies
or
anything
vivace
went
out
with
us
in
the
electric
carriage
and
even
ess
kay
had
to
admire
him
as
he
sat
straight
up
in
my
lap
like
a
bronze
statue
of
a
dog
he
a
thoroughbred
anyhow
she
remarked
he
ca
have
cost
a
penny
less
than
five
hundred
dollars
so
whoever
the
anonymous
giver
is
he
must
be
a
rich
man
i
rather
hazy
about
dollars
still
but
when
i
heard
that
i
felt
myself
go
red
i
knew
well
enough
that
the
giver
who
was
adam
was
very
far
from
being
a
rich
man
and
i
could
bear
to
think
that
he
had
perhaps
squandered
some
savings
on
buying
such
an
extravagant
present
for
me
but
the
more
i
thought
of
it
which
i
did
all
the
way
down
to
the
shops
the
more
i
thought
it
impossible
that
a
man
who
had
been
obliged
to
cross
the
atlantic
in
the
steerage
would
even
have
a
hundred
pounds
in
the
world
somebody
had
perhaps
given
him
the
dog
from
a
good
kennel
when
it
was
a
wee
puppy
i
said
to
myself
but
this
though
it
eased
my
mind
in
one
way
made
the
gift
seem
all
the
more
pathetic
that
that
poor
handsome
jim
brett
should
part
with
something
he
must
have
loved
for
who
could
have
vivace
and
not
love
him
to
please
me
i
should
have
liked
to
write
a
note
to
the
manhattan
club
where
he
had
told
me
he
was
employed
to
thank
him
but
he
had
sent
the
present
anonymously
and
i
felt
somehow
as
if
he
meant
or
wished
me
to
acknowledge
it
while
i
was
wondering
what
i
should
do
the
brougham
stopped
before
a
shop
even
larger
than
harrod
or
the
army
and
navy
stores
there
were
lovely
things
in
the
windows
things
that
looked
like
american
women
and
not
like
english
or
even
french
ones
though
i
could
define
the
difference
if
i
were
ordered
to
with
a
revolver
at
my
head
the
petticoats
and
stockings
and
belts
and
lace
things
and
parasols
and
especially
blouses
were
so
perfectly
thrilling
that
my
heart
began
to
beat
quite
fast
at
sight
of
them
i
felt
as
if
i
must
have
some
immediately
and
when
ess
kay
said
that
this
was
quite
a
cheap
store
i
said
to
myself
that
i
would
do
something
more
interesting
than
watch
her
shopping
she
had
to
buy
handkerchiefs
to
begin
with
for
most
of
hers
had
disappeared
in
the
wash
at
foreign
hotels
and
sally
wanted
veiling
those
were
not
interesting
to
me
because
they
are
necessary
and
necessaries
like
your
daily
bread
and
such
things
are
so
dull
i
said
that
i
would
just
wander
about
a
little
as
they
thought
they
would
be
some
time
and
we
made
an
appointment
to
meet
in
half
an
hour
at
what
they
called
the
notion
counter
i
had
an
idea
what
it
was
and
did
like
to
ask
because
i
had
asked
so
many
questions
already
but
i
knew
that
i
could
get
someone
to
take
me
there
when
the
half
hour
was
up
when
you
want
everything
you
see
but
are
sure
which
things
you
want
enough
to
buy
and
how
many
you
can
afford
it
less
confusing
to
prowl
alone
besides
there
was
an
exciting
feeling
of
independence
in
strolling
about
unchaperoned
in
a
shop
as
big
as
a
village
in
a
strange
foreign
city
i
really
did
need
a
sunshade
to
go
with
a
blue
dress
of
mine
because
my
only
light
one
if
i
do
count
rather
a
common
white
thing
is
pink
i
saw
some
beauties
and
i
wanted
to
ask
the
price
but
the
attendants
who
were
girls
with
lovely
figures
and
their
hair
done
in
exactly
the
same
flop
over
their
foreheads
were
so
interested
in
talking
about
a
young
man
they
all
knew
that
it
seemed
cruel
to
interrupt
them
especially
as
i
might
buy
the
sunshade
in
the
end
however
i
did
venture
to
speak
in
quite
a
humble
voice
by
and
by
but
the
girl
could
understand
a
word
until
i
repeated
everything
twice
a
sunshade
oh
you
mean
one
of
these
parasawls
she
said
then
excuse
me
it
your
english
accent
i
did
quite
catch
at
first
that
one
ten
dollars
and
cents
and
this
is
eight
dollars
while
we
were
busy
doing
the
dollars
into
pounds
and
shillings
we
got
quite
friendly
for
she
was
a
very
obliging
girl
and
did
bear
me
any
grudge
for
interrupting
though
her
friends
were
going
on
with
their
conversation
and
telling
such
exciting
things
about
the
young
man
that
she
must
have
been
dying
to
listen
however
my
girl
hardly
paid
any
attention
to
them
at
all
except
just
to
get
mixed
up
in
her
answers
to
me
once
or
twice
she
said
it
was
very
difficult
to
understand
english
people
on
account
of
their
not
opening
their
mouths
much
when
they
spoke
and
their
accent
being
so
strong
i
found
this
odd
because
we
always
feel
as
if
the
english
language
having
been
started
by
us
it
is
americans
who
have
an
accent
but
it
seems
that
a
great
many
people
in
the
states
dislike
the
way
we
talk
very
much
and
consider
it
extremely
affected
after
all
the
trouble
she
had
taken
i
felt
dreadfully
not
to
buy
anything
of
her
but
the
sunshades
were
too
expensive
though
she
said
they
were
marked
down
i
took
a
japanese
fan
instead
which
pops
out
at
you
like
a
from
a
fat
red
stick
and
even
that
was
a
dollar
and
cents
when
i
thought
it
would
be
sixpence
on
the
way
to
meet
ess
kay
and
sally
at
the
notion
counter
i
enquired
the
price
of
a
good
many
other
superlatively
beautiful
things
but
they
were
all
superlatively
high
as
well
and
by
the
time
a
very
dashing
young
man
who
said
he
was
a
had
steered
me
to
the
notions
i
felt
as
if
i
were
the
only
cheap
thing
in
the
whole
shop
to
be
sure
there
were
some
embroidered
collars
and
american
and
flowered
muslin
wrappers
which
i
could
have
had
without
ruining
myself
if
i
had
wanted
them
but
i
did
and
what
i
should
like
to
know
is
what
does
a
girl
do
if
she
poor
and
has
to
live
in
new
york
ess
kay
had
said
the
shop
was
a
cheap
shop
so
there
must
be
others
where
even
the
flowered
wrappers
and
collars
and
hatpins
are
more
and
besides
a
girl
could
go
through
life
dressed
entirely
in
such
things
however
judging
from
the
girls
i
have
seen
so
far
they
are
all
very
rich
except
the
lower
classes
and
of
course
it
much
simpler
to
do
without
things
if
you
can
just
be
poor
and
give
up
to
it
comfortably
without
thinking
of
appearances
like
us
as
soon
as
i
saw
the
notion
counter
i
knew
why
they
had
named
it
that
only
it
would
be
still
more
expressive
if
it
were
called
the
imagination
counter
it
was
lovely
and
looked
like
thousands
of
little
christmas
presents
spread
out
for
everyone
there
were
a
great
many
pretty
people
buying
things
at
it
and
in
most
of
the
other
departments
where
i
went
with
ess
kay
and
sally
but
when
i
admired
them
and
the
sweet
blouses
they
wore
and
the
way
they
carried
their
shoulders
and
hips
ess
kay
sniffed
and
said
there
was
nobody
in
new
york
now
nobody
at
all
who
was
worth
looking
at
and
would
be
till
october
except
those
who
were
just
in
the
city
for
a
day
or
two
of
shopping
like
us
when
i
suggested
that
these
charming
beings
in
white
muslins
and
summer
silks
might
be
here
in
that
way
she
did
not
think
it
at
all
probable
how
can
you
tell
i
asked
they
look
just
as
nice
as
we
do
indeed
i
thought
some
of
them
looked
nicer
but
i
been
much
too
well
brought
up
to
make
such
remarks
as
that
i
can
tell
because
i
do
know
their
faces
said
ess
kay
decidedly
in
a
tone
that
gave
a
capital
letter
to
her
last
word
and
yet
intimated
that
the
poor
unknown
by
her
things
could
possibly
be
worth
a
glance
now
mother
and
aunt
sophy
are
rather
like
that
it
almost
terrible
when
they
say
who
she
but
i
should
have
expected
it
to
be
the
same
in
america
if
sally
had
warned
me
i
suppose
it
quite
easy
to
remember
just
four
hundred
faces
as
you
sure
there
will
never
be
any
more
even
if
they
have
children
because
they
being
cut
down
instead
of
going
up
in
number
when
we
had
been
for
about
an
hour
and
a
half
in
the
big
shop
finished
all
we
had
to
do
there
and
must
motor
to
another
farther
up
before
meeting
parker
who
was
to
give
us
lunch
at
a
place
called
sherry
at
one
on
the
way
sally
suddenly
exclaimed
oh
cousin
katherine
we
must
initiate
this
dear
child
into
the
mysteries
of
ice
cream
soda
water
and
i
just
yearning
for
some
myself
anyhow
huyler
said
ess
kay
to
her
a
very
young
man
with
eyes
that
looked
positively
ill
with
intelligence
and
a
way
of
snapping
out
all
right
when
she
spoke
to
him
that
would
make
stan
sit
up
with
surprise
if
his
chauffeur
did
it
sally
said
that
the
nicest
oasis
in
the
desert
of
london
was
an
american
place
where
you
can
get
ice
cream
soda
water
but
i
had
never
had
any
and
in
the
burning
heat
of
the
new
york
morning
which
flung
itself
into
the
shop
like
a
great
wave
in
spite
of
fierce
electric
fans
i
could
have
purred
in
pure
delight
over
the
piled
up
froth
in
that
tall
glass
it
tasted
like
frozen
velvet
flavoured
with
strawberries
and
i
should
have
loved
to
be
an
ostrich
or
an
anaconda
so
that
the
sensation
might
have
lasted
longer
there
were
no
men
in
the
shop
only
women
and
so
pretty
that
you
wondered
if
there
were
a
notice
posted
up
over
the
door
forbidding
plain
ladies
to
enter
two
or
three
had
yellow
hair
yellower
than
mine
and
ess
kay
said
they
were
actresses
who
always
came
back
to
new
york
in
summer
to
wait
for
things
to
turn
up
just
as
chickens
come
home
to
roost
and
that
they
were
supposed
to
be
resting
i
had
always
thought
that
a
banana
made
you
feel
more
as
if
you
had
eaten
a
large
elaborate
dinner
than
any
other
one
thing
possibly
could
but
i
found
that
an
ice
cream
soda
is
even
more
so
and
it
was
lucky
for
us
that
we
had
another
hour
shopping
to
do
ess
kay
made
it
an
hour
and
a
half
because
potter
is
only
her
brother
before
luncheon
the
next
shop
was
even
more
wonderful
than
the
first
and
would
have
been
a
great
deal
more
solemn
and
dignified
and
even
conventional
if
the
same
kind
of
wooden
balls
had
gone
tearing
round
like
mad
squirrels
in
wire
cages
over
the
counters
with
people
money
shut
up
inside
them
there
were
very
young
youths
sitting
in
tall
pulpit
things
who
caught
the
balls
on
the
fly
in
a
sporting
way
and
did
something
to
them
but
i
never
could
see
what
and
afterwards
sent
them
back
with
the
greenback
bills
inside
turned
miraculously
into
silver
and
pretty
miniature
pennies
when
we
got
to
sherry
potter
was
waiting
for
us
and
looking
cross
i
think
persons
with
turned
up
noses
show
crossness
more
easily
than
the
other
kind
and
potter
had
the
expression
in
his
eyes
that
vic
has
when
her
shoes
are
tight
and
mother
is
in
a
trying
mood
at
the
same
time
i
should
be
surprised
if
he
has
a
horrid
temper
although
he
thinks
of
so
many
funny
things
and
though
he
is
so
nice
to
me
he
ca
help
saying
things
sometimes
which
show
that
he
has
a
prejudice
against
england
that
seems
extraordinary
and
shows
one
how
conceited
we
english
really
are
for
one
is
quite
accustomed
to
the
idea
that
there
may
be
people
who
do
care
for
americans
but
it
is
odd
that
americans
may
not
like
us
i
suppose
it
on
a
par
with
the
sentiments
in
our
national
anthem
which
when
one
comes
to
analyse
them
exactly
suggest
a
sense
of
give
and
take
or
for
that
matter
a
sense
of
humour
confound
politics
frustrate
knavish
tricks
but
naturally
bless
everything
in
which
we
are
concerned
as
we
are
certain
to
be
above
reproach
i
afraid
that
quite
of
a
piece
with
the
calm
confidence
we
have
in
our
own
superiority
although
i
daresay
i
should
never
have
realised
it
if
it
were
for
potter
parker
and
his
perky
nose
it
began
to
be
less
perky
when
we
were
all
settled
at
a
table
in
a
perfectly
charming
restaurant
the
most
restful
place
to
eat
in
that
i
ever
saw
i
ca
imagine
even
a
fiend
being
in
it
for
long
and
it
was
deliciously
cool
as
if
we
had
come
into
a
shadowy
green
wood
after
the
blazing
brassy
glare
of
the
streets
the
big
room
really
was
rather
like
a
wood
so
the
simile
an
open
space
in
a
wood
ringed
round
with
tall
trees
bending
their
branches
low
over
a
still
pool
the
soothing
brown
of
the
wainscoted
walls
gave
the
effect
the
great
hanging
baskets
of
ferns
and
moss
that
swung
from
the
ceiling
were
the
and
the
many
round
tables
with
green
velvet
chairs
grouped
closely
round
them
on
the
polished
floor
were
the
with
green
pads
floating
on
the
surface
of
the
pond
nearly
everything
we
had
for
lunch
was
in
a
more
or
less
advanced
state
of
frozenness
from
the
bouillon
ever
so
far
along
to
the
ices
in
the
shape
of
fruits
toward
the
end
nevertheless
all
of
us
except
potter
drank
iced
water
instead
of
wine
whenever
we
stopped
eating
for
an
instant
or
could
think
of
anything
particular
to
say
and
the
more
we
had
the
more
we
seemed
to
want
there
was
a
kind
of
curse
upon
us
it
has
never
occurred
to
vic
or
me
to
lie
down
in
the
afternoon
though
she
tries
to
sleep
a
little
sometimes
if
she
going
to
a
ball
but
when
we
got
home
ess
kay
and
sally
took
it
quite
as
a
matter
of
course
that
we
would
lie
down
before
going
to
coney
island
to
dine
and
see
fireworks
and
other
things
they
were
surprised
when
i
did
want
to
but
ess
kay
said
in
that
case
potter
would
entertain
me
while
they
rested
i
told
her
it
was
necessary
but
potter
wanted
me
to
bet
my
sweet
life
that
it
was
just
the
one
proposition
on
earth
for
him
so
he
and
vivace
and
i
sat
in
the
fountain
court
while
ess
kay
and
sally
went
upstairs
potter
was
suddenly
a
changed
man
as
soon
as
he
and
i
were
alone
together
becoming
exactly
what
he
had
been
yesterday
when
i
first
ran
downstairs
and
he
introduced
himself
he
did
chaff
me
about
my
country
and
make
fun
of
our
government
or
hint
that
american
men
were
the
only
men
living
who
knew
how
to
treat
women
as
he
seemed
to
delight
in
doing
when
his
sister
and
cousin
were
with
us
he
began
by
offering
to
teach
me
some
of
his
best
slang
but
as
the
lesson
went
on
it
turned
out
to
be
rather
more
like
a
lesson
in
flirtation
i
would
have
been
even
more
startled
than
i
was
if
i
had
already
had
a
little
experience
on
board
ship
with
doremus
at
home
often
thought
it
must
be
very
pleasant
to
be
out
and
able
to
flirt
but
i
never
had
a
chance
because
as
vic
said
it
was
her
turn
first
and
the
only
young
man
not
a
relation
that
i
ever
talked
with
alone
was
the
curate
who
would
as
soon
have
tried
to
flirt
with
a
bishopess
as
with
one
of
mother
daughters
but
i
like
doremus
kind
of
flirtation
almost
better
than
parker
doremus
makes
you
feel
as
if
you
were
a
beautiful
young
heroine
in
a
play
and
you
are
almost
sorry
there
is
no
audience
to
applaud
the
witty
things
he
says
and
the
smart
answers
he
inspires
you
to
think
of
just
as
if
he
were
giving
you
a
clue
potter
is
different
and
instead
of
an
audience
you
want
a
kind
of
perpetual
chaperon
not
a
briareus
creature
with
lots
of
hands
to
applaud
it
is
silly
i
know
to
blush
and
simper
but
i
could
think
of
anything
else
to
do
potter
was
so
alarming
and
i
would
allow
him
to
tell
my
fortune
by
my
hand
for
it
was
much
too
hot
even
if
it
had
been
i
should
have
wanted
my
hand
held
for
i
do
hate
being
touched
by
anyone
i
not
fond
of
when
i
told
him
that
he
said
it
was
very
simple
what
i
had
to
do
was
to
get
fond
of
him
and
then
it
would
be
all
right
i
sha
have
time
i
said
there
be
too
much
for
me
to
think
about
and
then
i
shall
be
going
home
how
long
does
it
take
an
english
girl
to
get
fond
of
a
man
said
he
i
told
him
i
did
know
anything
about
that
as
i
was
out
but
i
supposed
it
depended
on
the
kind
of
girl
i
guess
it
depends
more
on
the
man
in
your
climate
does
it
asked
potter
but
over
here
it
sometimes
a
question
of
hours
for
both
sides
why
a
chum
of
mine
went
out
to
san
francisco
on
business
which
was
going
to
keep
him
just
one
day
he
met
a
girl
at
dinner
fell
in
love
with
her
while
she
was
eating
her
soup
and
told
her
so
before
dessert
came
along
she
vacillated
over
the
ice
cream
but
said
yes
with
the
peaches
and
pears
next
day
they
got
married
and
he
brought
her
back
east
for
a
wedding
trip
what
did
they
do
about
the
banns
oh
americans
have
done
away
with
banns
since
the
revolution
i
guess
when
we
fellows
fall
in
love
we
in
a
hurry
marry
in
haste
repent
at
leisure
i
quoted
primly
we
do
repent
we
just
get
a
divorce
it
saves
worry
incompatibility
of
the
affections
or
fatty
degeneration
of
the
temper
or
something
like
that
but
i
do
need
to
talk
of
such
things
to
you
nobody
who
got
a
like
lady
betty
bulkeley
would
part
with
it
while
he
had
a
button
left
on
his
coat
i
do
see
what
buttons
would
have
to
do
with
it
i
said
but
as
i
had
always
been
sent
out
of
the
room
at
home
directly
anyone
began
even
to
mention
divorce
i
thought
i
had
better
go
upstairs
and
dress
for
dinner
at
coney
island
parker
begged
me
not
but
i
would
and
vivace
barked
as
if
he
were
under
the
impression
that
he
was
a
watch
dog
so
thanks
to
him
i
got
away
without
trouble
v
about
west
point
and
proposals
i
could
hardly
have
supposed
that
there
were
as
many
people
in
the
whole
world
put
together
as
at
coney
island
and
most
of
them
were
in
pairs
like
the
animals
on
their
way
to
the
ark
they
all
seemed
to
be
engaged
to
each
other
and
delighted
with
each
other
society
or
else
married
and
dreadfully
tired
of
it
or
else
they
had
dyspepsia
or
else
they
had
brought
too
many
of
their
children
for
they
had
droves
of
very
small
ones
who
bellowed
louder
than
any
english
children
i
ever
saw
and
tyrannised
over
their
parents
in
the
most
unbridled
way
but
coney
island
was
fun
and
i
felt
more
than
ever
that
i
was
dreaming
a
long
long
dream
of
sands
and
huge
hotels
and
queer
little
booths
for
dinner
we
ate
nothing
but
fish
of
so
many
different
kinds
and
some
of
them
so
strange
that
i
almost
feared
the
dream
might
turn
into
a
nightmare
afterwards
i
found
the
clams
rather
like
olives
you
hate
the
first
but
when
you
have
had
three
you
feel
you
would
like
three
dozen
and
they
are
not
at
all
easy
to
forget
we
went
down
under
the
sea
and
were
introduced
to
horrific
monsters
sailed
up
and
down
on
switchbacks
which
made
ess
kay
ill
but
she
nobly
refused
to
desert
me
in
such
surroundings
a
state
of
mind
which
made
her
chin
look
incredibly
square
eventually
after
many
adventures
by
the
way
we
arrived
at
the
moon
and
not
only
got
into
the
middle
of
it
but
made
acquaintance
with
the
inhabitants
none
of
whom
appeared
to
be
over
two
feet
high
or
to
have
anything
to
speak
of
between
their
chins
and
their
toes
after
that
experience
minstrel
shows
and
concerts
and
persons
who
told
your
fortunes
with
snakes
or
ate
glass
were
rather
an
anticlimax
still
i
enjoyed
them
all
so
much
that
i
was
incapable
of
extreme
annoyance
when
we
discovered
that
evening
had
an
impressionist
sketch
of
me
which
made
me
look
like
an
elderly
murderess
we
got
back
to
new
york
almost
indecently
late
but
in
the
meaner
parts
through
which
we
had
to
pass
on
the
way
to
our
gorgeousness
the
streets
swarmed
with
poor
creatures
pallid
with
heat
evidently
preparing
to
camp
out
of
doors
till
morning
it
was
a
strange
and
interesting
sight
but
made
me
feel
guilty
when
i
recalled
it
afterwards
in
my
great
cool
bedroom
with
my
five
different
kinds
of
baths
next
morning
i
was
waked
early
to
find
more
presents
of
flowers
in
huge
stacks
and
to
get
ready
for
west
point
i
was
a
little
tired
from
yesterday
and
the
dry
heat
gave
me
rather
the
sensation
of
being
a
scientist
field
mouse
in
a
vacuum
so
that
i
should
have
dreaded
even
a
short
journey
if
we
had
been
making
it
by
water
it
was
even
better
than
if
we
had
been
ordinary
tourists
on
one
of
the
big
hudson
river
boats
i
had
heard
about
for
we
were
to
travel
luxuriously
in
a
little
steam
yacht
of
potter
which
he
calls
the
poached
egg
because
it
ca
be
beaten
it
is
not
a
vulgar
yacht
as
one
might
have
thought
from
the
name
but
a
dainty
thing
that
ought
to
have
been
the
butterfly
ye
white
ladye
or
something
of
that
sort
when
i
said
so
parker
insisted
that
he
would
at
once
her
lady
betty
which
would
have
a
prettier
meaning
than
anything
else
and
then
i
was
sorry
i
spoken
i
had
expected
to
be
disappointed
in
the
river
because
nearly
everybody
i
met
on
board
ship
tried
to
impress
upon
me
that
we
had
nothing
half
so
good
in
england
while
as
for
the
rhine
it
was
a
patch
on
the
hudson
i
even
wanted
to
be
disappointed
out
of
patriotism
or
spite
which
are
much
the
same
thing
sometimes
but
i
could
i
found
the
hudson
too
grand
for
petty
jealousy
it
seemed
to
me
like
a
great
noble
poem
rolling
on
and
on
in
splendid
cadences
and
i
have
heard
some
music
of
wagner
that
it
reminded
me
of
somehow
the
hills
or
mountains
i
not
sure
which
to
call
them
even
the
palisades
which
have
been
so
dinned
into
my
ears
were
not
high
enough
to
satisfy
me
at
a
first
glance
but
soon
i
saw
that
it
was
their
grouping
and
their
perfect
proportion
in
relation
to
each
other
which
made
them
so
exquisite
as
we
steamed
on
along
the
green
and
golden
flood
between
banks
that
appeared
to
fall
back
in
admiration
i
began
to
love
the
hudson
so
much
that
i
could
have
shrieked
with
rage
at
the
great
staring
advertisements
on
hoardings
what
can
the
scenery
have
done
to
americans
that
they
should
do
their
best
to
spoil
it
no
wonder
most
of
them
come
over
to
see
ours
which
we
have
the
sense
to
let
alone
even
if
it
crumbles
sally
and
parker
laughed
at
my
fury
but
i
did
see
how
they
could
take
it
so
calmly
it
is
my
scenery
so
i
do
trouble
myself
said
potter
when
i
asked
why
he
did
get
up
a
secret
night
expedition
to
burn
or
chop
down
all
the
hoardings
but
i
sure
english
people
are
careless
like
that
each
person
thinks
the
good
of
the
whole
country
is
business
at
least
one
would
suppose
so
by
the
way
everybody
who
comes
to
battlemead
talks
politics
and
affairs
of
public
interest
morning
noon
and
night
it
seems
though
in
america
only
policemen
and
people
who
live
in
washington
care
about
politics
really
except
to
get
benefits
for
themselves
and
it
is
good
form
to
be
too
much
interested
in
such
things
victoria
would
like
this
rule
for
she
has
confessed
to
me
that
political
questions
bore
her
and
she
would
much
rather
be
talked
to
about
love
or
motoring
or
even
bridge
but
she
always
reads
the
newspapers
hard
for
fifteen
minutes
while
thompson
does
her
hair
if
she
going
out
to
a
big
lunch
or
dinner
so
that
she
will
be
up
in
everything
and
able
to
talk
brilliantly
to
members
of
parliament
or
stuffy
old
things
in
the
house
of
lords
i
calmed
down
somewhat
after
i
recovered
from
the
first
shock
of
seeing
several
islands
entirely
devoted
to
insisting
that
uneeda
biscuit
or
a
cigar
or
some
other
extraneous
thing
which
you
sure
you
need
in
the
least
and
would
buy
even
if
you
did
when
it
had
been
forced
on
you
like
that
there
was
so
much
to
admire
that
it
seemed
a
shame
to
fret
besides
it
was
soothing
to
sit
on
the
deck
under
a
pale
green
awning
drinking
what
i
call
a
lemon
squash
and
potter
and
sally
obstinately
believe
to
be
lemonade
while
ess
kay
angrily
read
nasty
paragraphs
about
herself
and
hilariously
about
her
friends
in
a
regular
highwayman
of
a
paper
sally
woodburn
told
me
charming
legends
of
the
hudson
dear
old
dutch
things
most
of
them
which
had
been
made
into
plays
and
poems
and
i
was
sorry
when
we
came
to
west
point
at
last
but
i
was
sorry
for
long
the
minute
we
got
on
shore
at
a
quaint
little
landing
shoved
incongruously
in
among
beautiful
wooded
hills
the
most
exquisite
scents
of
ferns
and
trees
and
sweet
moist
earth
came
hurrying
down
to
welcome
us
eton
is
not
more
beautiful
than
west
point
and
as
we
drove
up
the
hill
under
an
arbour
of
trees
i
saw
that
the
buildings
cleverly
contrived
to
look
old
and
grey
and
picturesque
like
ours
the
elms
in
a
big
green
square
past
the
top
of
the
hill
had
a
venerable
air
too
so
they
must
have
been
precocious
about
growing
for
it
does
stand
to
reason
that
west
point
can
be
as
ancient
as
oxford
or
eton
but
anyway
the
elms
were
there
making
an
effect
that
england
could
improve
on
and
there
were
some
grey
stone
barracks
and
a
long
line
of
officers
quarters
built
of
wood
and
brick
i
was
glad
that
we
were
to
stop
with
potter
instead
of
going
to
an
hotel
for
i
did
want
to
see
thoroughly
what
garrison
life
is
like
potter
has
only
half
a
house
though
i
suppose
he
rich
enough
to
buy
up
all
west
point
if
it
were
for
sale
but
he
had
got
a
chum
of
his
who
lives
in
the
other
half
to
clear
out
of
his
part
and
give
it
to
us
for
the
day
and
night
vic
has
been
to
aldershot
and
even
to
malta
and
gib
but
i
never
have
and
i
never
saw
any
officers
quarters
at
home
so
i
do
know
how
they
compare
with
american
ones
potter
and
his
friend
are
exactly
like
a
doll
house
turned
into
a
museum
the
rooms
are
tiny
and
most
of
the
furniture
is
made
to
fold
up
but
stan
would
be
green
with
envy
if
he
could
see
their
persian
rugs
and
their
silver
things
and
their
dozens
of
meerschaums
and
their
curiosities
from
all
over
the
world
i
asked
potter
what
he
would
do
when
he
was
ordered
away
that
depends
on
where
i
ordered
said
he
if
i
do
like
the
place
i
resign
and
be
a
mere
cit
it
would
be
easy
to
get
back
again
into
the
army
if
there
were
any
fun
going
what
kind
of
fun
i
wanted
to
know
a
war
with
somebody
of
course
said
he
men
have
the
most
extraordinary
ideas
of
fun
but
they
seem
to
be
alike
about
that
in
england
and
america
they
are
never
so
happy
as
when
they
are
killing
something
or
in
danger
of
being
killed
themselves
i
ca
imagine
how
it
would
feel
to
be
like
that
but
i
know
if
they
were
different
we
should
hate
them
and
potter
looked
so
nice
in
his
soldier
clothes
which
he
got
into
while
we
were
making
ourselves
pretty
for
lunch
that
i
could
help
thinking
it
would
be
a
pity
for
him
to
leave
the
army
his
friend
was
invited
to
lunch
with
us
to
make
up
for
sacrificing
his
house
he
is
nicer
than
potter
or
even
doremus
but
not
half
so
handsome
or
brave
looking
or
with
such
a
charming
voice
as
poor
jim
brett
who
is
not
i
suppose
a
gentleman
except
by
nature
otherwise
he
could
have
been
in
the
steerage
i
thought
it
was
silly
to
have
wire
nettings
in
all
the
doors
and
windows
just
to
keep
away
a
few
innocent
midges
until
we
sat
out
after
lunch
there
is
a
pleasant
balcony
with
an
upstairs
and
a
downstairs
which
potter
and
captain
collingwood
call
the
piazza
and
it
would
have
been
delightful
sitting
there
while
the
men
smoked
if
appalling
little
animals
with
a
ridiculous
number
of
thin
legs
had
come
buzzing
round
us
they
were
things
got
up
in
loud
suits
of
black
and
grey
stripes
not
in
the
least
like
our
quiet
respectable
midges
at
home
and
they
were
even
honourable
enough
to
wait
until
sunset
before
attacking
you
they
pricked
horribly
like
pins
your
maid
has
stuck
in
the
wrong
places
and
they
had
a
horrid
for
your
ankles
i
sorry
i
had
on
clocked
stockings
and
i
apologised
heartily
to
potter
for
poking
fun
at
his
wire
nettings
though
it
was
so
hot
the
air
was
delicious
it
smelt
of
grass
and
lilies
with
a
sharp
little
spicy
tang
of
the
thick
virginia
creepers
which
made
a
shadowy
green
room
of
the
piazza
birds
were
simply
roaring
with
joy
in
the
trees
that
overhung
the
house
and
potter
and
i
almost
quarrelled
because
he
would
insist
that
some
huge
creatures
hopping
about
on
the
grass
were
robins
they
would
have
made
three
of
ours
and
were
much
more
like
quails
that
had
spilt
strawberry
juice
on
their
breasts
by
and
by
captain
collingwood
asked
if
lady
betty
did
want
to
go
and
see
things
she
booked
to
me
for
flirtation
walk
said
potter
before
i
could
answer
three
a
crowd
there
old
chap
on
which
i
regret
to
state
captain
collingwood
suggested
that
potter
should
teach
his
own
grandmother
something
about
nourishing
herself
with
an
egg
diet
anyhow
i
suppose
you
do
object
to
a
rearguard
for
inspection
of
camp
and
other
features
of
public
interest
he
went
on
and
after
some
hesitation
potter
decided
that
this
would
be
admissible
ess
kay
and
sally
both
wanted
to
lie
down
it
strange
the
fondness
american
women
have
for
putting
themselves
in
a
horizontal
position
in
the
daytime
so
ess
kay
said
that
she
would
commission
her
brother
as
chaperon
i
need
be
anxious
she
assured
me
it
was
quite
il
as
if
i
would
have
worried
about
a
thing
like
that
i
was
delighted
to
go
because
the
most
interesting
groups
had
been
passing
the
house
and
it
was
difficult
to
see
all
you
wanted
to
through
the
veil
of
creepers
without
continually
craning
your
neck
tall
boys
got
up
much
like
glorified
buttons
were
sauntering
about
holding
sunshades
over
the
heads
of
girls
so
young
that
they
would
have
been
in
short
frocks
with
their
hair
down
their
backs
in
england
the
girls
were
in
white
muslin
or
pale
colours
with
charming
floppy
leghorn
hats
trimmed
with
flowers
and
they
looked
like
the
daintiest
prettiest
of
french
dolls
but
i
was
a
great
deal
more
interested
in
the
youths
who
were
the
cadets
first
classmen
potter
said
and
would
be
second
lieutenants
next
year
i
never
could
take
much
interest
in
eton
boys
the
few
i
have
seen
for
they
look
such
children
that
one
would
be
positively
ashamed
to
bother
with
them
but
the
west
point
cadets
though
one
could
exactly
take
them
seriously
like
regularly
men
perhaps
fascinated
me
from
the
very
first
glance
through
potter
virginia
creeper
they
looked
as
if
they
thought
a
lot
of
themselves
and
the
girls
they
were
with
had
the
air
of
encouraging
them
to
think
it
i
wondered
what
kind
of
things
they
said
to
girls
and
secretly
longed
to
find
out
it
seems
that
in
summer
the
cadets
leave
their
barracks
and
go
into
camp
which
is
a
time
of
year
that
the
girls
who
visit
west
point
and
those
whose
fathers
are
stationed
there
like
very
much
we
had
a
glimpse
of
the
tents
from
the
long
street
of
the
officers
quarters
and
after
we
had
visited
a
few
technical
things
in
which
i
was
too
polite
to
show
that
i
was
hardly
interested
we
strolled
over
to
where
we
could
see
the
little
white
pyramids
gleaming
under
the
stars
and
stripes
i
had
been
afraid
that
all
the
cadets
would
have
gone
away
to
flirtation
walk
with
girls
but
to
my
joy
there
were
plenty
left
in
camp
on
chairs
under
the
trees
near
by
two
or
three
ladies
were
sitting
with
some
girls
and
a
crowd
of
cadets
were
talking
to
them
there
a
great
pal
of
mine
laurence
said
captain
collingwood
she
would
love
to
know
you
lady
betty
do
you
mind
if
i
introduce
you
to
each
other
see
here
that
means
we
shall
be
hitched
up
with
all
that
lot
of
cadets
potter
objected
quite
crossly
what
the
good
of
wasting
time
i
hurried
to
say
that
i
should
consider
it
a
waste
of
time
that
i
should
be
delighted
to
meet
laurence
and
also
a
few
sample
cadets
if
any
could
be
provided
for
the
consumption
of
an
enquiring
british
tourist
captain
collingwood
thought
that
one
or
two
might
be
found
who
would
not
object
to
the
sacrifice
and
five
minutes
later
i
was
having
more
fun
than
i
had
ever
had
before
in
my
life
laurence
was
sweet
and
so
tactful
she
scarcely
talked
to
me
at
all
except
to
ask
me
how
i
liked
america
and
a
few
of
the
things
people
are
obliged
to
get
off
their
minds
when
they
meet
a
foreigner
and
then
she
introduced
five
cadets
i
was
terrified
for
a
minute
because
until
i
left
home
my
whole
youthful
male
experience
consisted
of
one
brother
three
cousins
and
two
curates
dealt
with
separately
and
with
long
sleepy
intervals
between
i
began
to
wonder
how
i
could
possibly
manage
five
tall
youths
at
once
and
to
rack
my
brains
for
the
right
kind
of
conversation
but
before
i
should
have
had
time
to
say
knife
to
a
curate
i
found
myself
chatting
away
with
those
cadets
as
if
i
had
grown
up
with
them
i
never
once
stopped
to
think
what
i
should
say
next
and
neither
did
they
some
girls
were
introduced
to
me
too
but
luckily
they
did
seem
to
expect
me
to
talk
to
them
much
so
i
did
more
and
more
cadets
kept
coming
over
from
camp
and
joining
our
group
and
being
introduced
in
agreeable
droves
until
i
gave
up
even
trying
to
remember
their
names
there
was
one
though
in
the
first
batch
of
five
whose
name
was
easy
to
get
hold
of
and
keep
in
mind
because
it
was
smith
besides
he
was
the
best
looking
of
all
which
made
classifying
him
a
real
pleasure
the
girls
who
spoke
to
smith
called
him
captain
perhaps
jokingly
and
i
asked
how
he
could
be
a
captain
and
yet
a
cadet
unless
it
meant
cricket
then
he
explained
that
the
cadets
had
all
the
different
grades
of
officers
from
adjutant
and
captain
down
to
sergeant
and
wanted
to
know
if
there
were
any
other
questions
i
would
care
to
ask
i
said
that
there
were
lots
but
i
was
sure
if
i
might
i
give
you
a
permit
said
he
in
a
military
way
so
i
began
with
the
buttons
i
should
like
to
know
why
you
have
so
many
all
those
rows
on
your
jackets
and
it
only
the
middle
row
you
seem
to
use
for
anything
we
use
the
others
to
give
away
to
girls
to
remember
us
by
answered
my
cadet
it
forbidden
but
that
a
detail
or
rather
it
why
the
girls
like
to
have
them
i
stared
none
of
yours
are
missing
most
of
are
pinned
on
at
present
it
that
way
with
all
of
us
our
plebs
sew
on
for
us
at
night
and
use
the
door
for
a
thimble
oh
what
are
plebs
if
you
please
are
you
allowed
valets
i
guess
they
call
fags
in
your
country
there
are
a
lot
of
them
lying
around
shall
i
have
some
caught
and
dragged
here
they
might
squirm
a
bit
as
they
are
used
to
ladies
society
but
i
hastily
protested
against
such
a
cruel
exhibition
and
went
on
with
my
questions
i
asked
what
they
did
in
winter
and
how
long
they
had
to
be
cadets
and
whether
they
were
in
a
hurry
to
be
officers
not
as
long
as
the
girls
can
put
up
with
us
as
we
are
said
my
cadet
some
of
them
even
pretend
they
like
us
better
i
can
quite
understand
that
i
exclaimed
and
then
they
all
laughed
and
some
of
them
applauded
the
important
question
is
said
captain
or
smith
whether
you
are
going
to
be
an
officers
or
a
cadets
lady
i
had
an
idea
what
he
meant
but
i
remembered
vic
saying
that
in
the
lower
middle
classes
they
sometimes
call
a
man
wife
his
lady
perhaps
i
thought
the
expression
had
been
brought
over
to
the
nicest
people
in
america
in
the
which
they
all
talk
so
much
about
for
certainly
of
the
people
in
her
must
have
been
cooks
or
in
the
steerage
there
are
too
many
descendants
for
the
first
class
passengers
alone
after
considering
for
a
minute
i
said
in
rather
an
embarrassed
way
that
i
was
quite
sure
yet
whether
i
would
be
either
you
must
be
one
or
the
other
you
know
or
you
be
like
the
bat
in
the
fable
who
was
neither
bird
nor
beast
and
so
was
out
of
all
the
fun
on
both
sides
i
may
be
prejudiced
but
i
advise
you
to
be
a
lady
and
you
better
decide
now
on
account
of
i
repeated
puzzled
yes
on
account
of
making
out
your
card
say
lady
betty
if
you
going
in
with
us
can
i
make
out
your
card
then
arose
a
clamour
it
appeared
that
they
all
wanted
to
make
out
the
card
whatever
it
was
i
asked
if
i
could
have
one
from
each
but
it
appeared
that
you
could
do
that
my
cadet
had
spoken
first
so
he
said
that
he
would
do
it
but
the
others
could
give
me
and
chevrons
and
decorate
fans
for
me
instead
do
you
like
hops
lady
betty
enquired
a
perfect
pet
of
a
cadet
who
looked
like
a
cherub
in
uniform
hops
i
wondered
why
he
should
ask
me
such
an
irrelevant
question
but
i
answered
as
intelligently
as
i
could
i
do
know
much
about
them
i
think
they
graceful
but
i
do
like
the
smell
he
looked
petrified
the
yes
it
makes
one
sleepy
i
guess
we
wo
give
you
much
chance
to
be
sleepy
said
he
at
our
hop
then
i
understood
but
what
a
funny
thing
to
call
a
ball
a
hop
they
explained
too
when
they
saw
how
stupid
i
was
that
you
were
an
officers
lady
if
you
danced
with
them
and
walked
with
them
and
flirted
with
them
and
did
bother
with
cadets
or
vice
versa
then
i
decided
at
once
that
i
would
be
a
cadets
lady
though
i
was
sorry
i
had
only
one
night
to
be
it
in
they
were
sorry
too
and
showed
their
sorrow
in
so
many
nice
ways
that
i
enjoyed
myself
immensely
and
quite
saw
how
nice
it
must
feel
to
be
out
if
you
are
a
success
they
wanted
to
draw
lots
for
which
cadet
should
take
me
to
flirtation
walk
but
i
said
i
had
to
go
with
parker
he
must
have
been
listening
from
a
distance
though
he
ought
to
have
been
talking
with
a
pretty
girl
who
had
no
hat
for
he
came
up
to
me
at
once
and
announced
that
it
was
time
to
go
now
he
rather
put
on
airs
of
having
a
right
to
tell
me
what
i
must
do
and
i
did
like
it
much
especially
before
those
dear
cadets
but
it
would
have
been
childish
to
make
a
fuss
besides
i
was
his
guest
i
went
like
a
disagreeable
lamb
sulking
on
its
way
to
the
slaughter
but
thank
goodness
i
was
engaged
already
for
nearly
all
the
dances
and
most
of
them
had
to
be
split
in
two
there
were
so
many
cadets
for
them
i
think
by
the
by
i
shall
try
to
get
stan
to
take
me
to
sandhurst
some
day
to
see
if
it
is
at
all
like
west
point
and
whether
they
have
hops
potter
made
fun
of
the
cadets
and
called
them
white
meat
and
little
things
that
got
in
the
way
but
when
i
asked
a
straight
question
he
had
to
confess
that
he
had
been
one
himself
only
six
years
ago
i
was
when
i
graduated
he
said
one
of
the
youngest
men
in
my
class
which
was
the
same
as
telling
me
that
he
is
now
ten
years
older
than
i
am
it
makes
him
seem
quite
old
somehow
although
he
is
so
nice
to
me
in
most
ways
he
stirs
me
up
to
feel
antagonistic
as
though
i
wanted
to
contradict
him
and
not
like
things
that
he
likes
and
i
believe
it
is
the
same
with
him
about
me
for
i
make
his
eyes
look
angry
very
often
i
felt
he
was
disappointed
because
i
admired
the
cadets
so
much
and
had
promised
so
many
dances
and
i
was
in
a
mood
to
tease
him
but
i
fancy
he
is
the
kind
who
would
take
teasing
well
and
the
scenery
he
was
showing
me
was
so
beautiful
that
presently
i
resolved
to
be
good
we
saw
kosciusko
monument
and
i
would
insist
upon
his
telling
me
things
about
kosciusko
himself
though
potter
did
seem
to
think
him
important
and
then
we
began
winding
our
way
along
a
most
exquisite
path
overhanging
the
river
always
shadowed
by
trees
sometimes
it
was
cut
through
a
green
arbour
with
a
light
like
liquid
emeralds
sometimes
it
ran
high
on
the
rocks
sometimes
it
dipped
down
close
to
the
water
but
invariably
there
was
just
enough
room
for
two
and
no
more
to
walk
side
by
side
we
met
several
couples
cadets
and
girls
young
officers
and
girls
sauntering
or
sitting
down
close
together
in
out
of
the
way
places
but
by
and
by
we
seemed
to
have
passed
beyond
the
inhabited
zone
then
potter
asked
me
if
i
were
not
tired
from
so
much
walking
and
if
i
would
like
to
rest
i
said
no
and
he
promptly
pretended
to
be
done
up
which
i
thought
very
silly
but
of
course
i
had
to
sit
down
by
him
on
a
rock
with
a
green
cushion
this
is
what
i
been
longing
for
all
day
said
he
i
had
and
i
was
thinking
about
the
cadets
but
i
agreed
that
it
was
beautiful
yes
it
is
he
answered
looking
at
me
i
never
saw
anything
so
pretty
say
lady
betty
you
an
awful
flirt
i
did
open
my
eyes
at
that
a
flirt
i
exclaimed
i
never
had
a
chance
to
try
being
it
i
guess
you
do
need
to
try
there
some
things
girls
like
you
are
born
knowing
i
been
miserable
all
the
afternoon
could
you
see
my
agony
i
did
notice
said
i
ah
that
the
trouble
you
were
thinking
of
me
of
course
i
ought
to
have
cared
for
those
little
boys
some
of
them
were
inches
taller
than
he
but
i
could
help
it
i
kept
saying
inside
is
a
foretaste
of
what
i
got
to
suffer
when
she
staying
with
katherine
at
the
moorings
i
do
know
when
i
been
so
unpopular
with
myself
i
do
see
how
i
going
to
get
along
unless
you
be
nice
to
me
right
now
i
am
nice
to
you
i
said
as
nice
as
i
know
how
to
be
i
could
teach
you
to
be
a
lot
nicer
say
lady
betty
let
me
you
his
eyes
though
they
are
such
a
pale
blue
had
that
silly
melting
look
in
them
that
my
cousin
loveland
have
when
he
talks
to
me
let
you
do
what
i
asked
almost
snappishly
for
a
person
sitting
in
such
a
lovely
place
teach
you
to
like
me
i
fell
all
over
myself
in
love
with
you
the
first
minute
i
saw
you
day
before
yesterday
i
exclaimed
what
nonsense
you
poking
fun
at
me
i
do
believe
in
love
at
first
sight
at
least
i
do
think
i
do
anyhow
nobody
could
fall
in
love
with
in
that
way
could
they
though
that
all
you
know
about
it
then
all
americans
will
fall
in
love
with
you
like
that
and
it
just
what
i
want
to
guard
against
i
want
you
to
be
engaged
to
me
before
you
go
to
newport
then
i
shall
feel
kind
of
safe
dear
me
are
you
really
proposing
and
it
is
in
joke
i
asked
i
do
wish
you
would
would
i
propose
to
lady
betty
bulkeley
in
joke
he
reproached
me
the
idea
of
proposing
to
any
girl
when
you
only
seen
her
three
times
what
did
i
tell
you
about
my
friend
in
san
francisco
i
was
working
slowly
up
to
this
even
then
yes
very
slowly
i
think
i
shown
a
great
deal
of
patience
american
girls
the
beauties
i
mean
are
quite
hurt
if
a
fellow
does
propose
somewhere
along
in
the
first
day
or
two
they
think
he
ca
appreciate
their
real
worth
and
that
he
deserves
what
he
gets
if
some
other
chap
walks
away
with
them
now
i
not
going
to
sit
still
on
my
perch
and
see
anything
else
walking
off
with
you
i
could
help
laughing
i
call
for
help
if
i
think
there
any
danger
said
i
but
i
ca
promise
more
than
that
i
did
come
over
to
america
to
pick
up
a
husband
he
looked
at
me
rather
queerly
when
i
said
that
almost
as
if
he
thought
i
had
come
for
that
express
purpose
and
was
trying
to
conceal
it
but
of
course
he
could
be
so
horrid
as
to
suppose
such
a
thing
really
and
i
must
have
imagined
the
strange
expression
if
he
only
knew
i
came
away
so
that
another
girl
might
be
sure
to
get
a
husband
and
i
not
allowed
to
go
back
until
he
has
been
got
they
just
growing
around
on
blackberry
bushes
and
in
strawberry
patches
for
you
to
pick
and
choose
said
potter
and
that
what
worries
me
i
a
wildly
jealous
fellow
i
got
two
month
leave
so
as
to
be
with
you
at
newport
and
i
tell
you
i
shall
see
a
bright
beautiful
crimson
if
too
many
dudes
come
fooling
around
the
shanty
say
wo
you
just
we
engaged
anyhow
and
see
how
you
like
it
but
now
i
was
really
cross
and
would
hear
a
word
more
of
such
nonsense
so
i
jumped
up
and
he
had
to
scramble
up
too
if
you
really
proposed
which
i
doubt
said
i
you
must
please
understand
that
you
been
formally
refused
but
i
forgive
you
because
i
believe
you
must
have
been
chaffing
and
because
it
my
first
proposal
so
at
all
events
i
ca
die
without
having
had
at
least
one
now
do
be
sensible
and
take
me
back
or
i
shall
have
to
find
my
way
alone
or
else
ask
a
strange
cadet
to
pilot
me
that
threat
found
a
vulnerable
spot
and
he
was
not
half
bad
on
the
way
home
perhaps
no
worse
than
the
name
of
the
walk
allowed
i
was
a
good
deal
excited
about
the
ball
as
it
was
my
very
first
sally
woodburn
had
looked
at
my
things
and
told
me
what
to
bring
not
that
it
was
a
hard
choice
for
i
have
only
four
frocks
with
me
in
which
i
could
go
to
a
dance
the
one
sally
wanted
me
to
wear
at
west
point
is
a
little
white
thing
of
embroidered
india
muslin
thompson
made
it
after
one
of
vic
and
it
is
a
rag
compared
to
sally
and
ess
kay
gorgeous
things
but
when
sally
had
done
my
hair
in
a
new
way
they
had
left
louise
behind
as
there
was
no
room
for
her
and
fastened
round
my
throat
a
lovely
string
of
pearls
she
brought
on
purpose
i
looked
quite
nice
the
hop
was
in
a
great
big
room
which
the
cadets
use
for
something
or
other
i
forget
what
and
it
was
decorated
with
quantities
of
american
flags
there
were
lots
of
girls
the
youngest
things
hardly
any
of
them
could
have
been
out
but
there
were
even
more
men
counting
officers
and
cadets
at
least
two
for
each
girl
the
card
which
my
particular
cadet
had
talked
about
making
for
me
was
a
programme
with
all
the
dances
and
the
men
names
and
illuminations
which
he
had
put
on
himself
it
was
beautiful
and
i
told
him
that
i
would
always
keep
it
i
danced
every
dance
with
two
partners
for
each
and
there
was
a
cotillion
afterwards
with
favours
to
remind
the
girls
who
got
them
of
west
point
little
flags
and
buttons
and
bits
of
gold
lace
but
i
was
very
lucky
for
some
of
the
friends
i
had
made
in
camp
had
smuggled
me
special
things
and
i
shall
have
quite
a
collection
of
sergeant
stripes
and
corporal
chevrons
belt
buckles
and
beautiful
bright
with
initials
scratched
on
them
i
do
believe
vic
had
half
so
much
fun
at
her
first
ball
as
i
had
at
mine
although
hers
is
so
many
seasons
ago
now
that
i
ca
remember
what
she
said
about
it
i
was
only
a
little
girl
then
and
she
in
the
habit
of
telling
me
things
as
she
is
now
although
i
did
get
to
bed
till
after
two
i
was
up
early
next
morning
because
i
had
promised
my
best
cadets
that
i
would
be
at
morning
parade
or
whatever
they
call
it
to
say
sally
went
with
me
and
it
was
quite
an
affecting
parting
i
shall
never
forget
those
dear
boys
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
though
i
ca
remember
any
of
their
names
as
after
all
i
lost
the
card
i
meant
to
keep
always
vi
about
the
park
and
love
stories
all
the
preparations
that
ess
kay
had
to
make
for
newport
kept
us
two
more
days
in
new
york
and
it
was
terribly
hot
but
i
was
not
sorry
to
stay
because
we
did
so
many
amusing
things
doremus
was
detained
too
by
his
tailor
he
said
so
we
saw
a
good
deal
of
him
as
van
der
windt
had
left
for
her
newport
cottage
we
did
go
to
a
roof
garden
entertainment
after
all
and
it
was
most
fascinating
but
quite
without
the
feeling
that
you
might
fall
off
which
i
had
expected
to
have
i
saw
the
moon
coming
up
and
gilding
thousands
of
roofs
and
i
could
help
wondering
which
was
the
roof
of
that
club
where
poor
handsome
jim
brett
was
employed
though
of
course
it
was
impossible
to
speak
of
him
to
anyone
except
vivace
we
lunched
one
day
at
an
enormous
and
very
fashionable
red
brick
hotel
called
the
and
went
into
a
turkish
room
and
had
delicious
things
to
eat
in
a
beautiful
restaurant
which
had
not
at
all
an
air
though
ess
kay
said
that
most
of
the
looking
people
whom
i
suspected
of
being
leaders
of
the
four
hundred
were
only
trippers
i
do
wonder
by
the
way
why
one
always
has
an
innate
sense
of
contempt
for
trippers
and
longs
to
be
sniffy
and
show
one
own
superiority
we
must
all
be
trippers
somewhere
and
sometimes
or
we
would
never
see
anything
of
the
world
indeed
i
suppose
i
am
by
way
of
being
a
tripper
now
but
one
never
seems
to
regard
one
self
in
such
a
light
or
imagine
that
anybody
else
could
be
so
undiscerning
i
had
known
that
a
hotel
could
be
as
big
as
the
though
ess
kay
says
there
are
several
just
about
as
large
in
new
york
and
she
has
heard
there
are
one
or
two
in
chicago
but
she
thanks
heaven
she
does
know
anything
personally
about
when
she
made
this
remark
i
remembered
what
sally
had
told
me
in
confidence
about
ess
kay
life
before
she
began
to
qualify
for
the
four
hundred
but
of
course
i
did
not
make
any
allusion
to
the
subject
for
fear
it
was
a
skeleton
in
her
closet
and
sally
says
that
chicago
people
think
new
york
a
place
compared
to
their
town
which
is
really
wonderful
and
most
interesting
as
i
shall
find
out
if
i
see
it
i
wish
i
could
but
i
suppose
i
sha
as
i
came
over
to
visit
ess
kay
not
to
do
the
second
day
after
we
came
back
from
west
point
as
i
went
downstairs
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
i
heard
ess
kay
at
the
telephone
which
is
in
a
little
room
along
a
corridor
off
the
fountain
court
she
was
having
a
long
conversation
with
someone
laughing
and
chatting
just
as
if
she
were
talking
to
a
visitor
and
presently
my
name
came
in
yes
lady
betty
bu
no
not
pronounced
that
way
my
child
as
if
it
were
spelt
yes
that
right
such
a
pretty
girl
a
perfect
dear
i
expect
the
men
will
be
wild
about
her
at
newport
potter
over
her
ha
ha
ha
do
you
think
so
well
perhaps
i
known
stranger
things
to
happen
no
it
not
her
father
but
her
brother
who
the
duke
awfully
i
wish
he
could
have
come
too
but
you
see
sally
would
you
know
what
sally
no
she
never
got
over
that
old
affair
southern
women
are
so
romantic
yes
i
bring
dear
little
betty
with
me
if
it
wo
tire
you
she
then
i
began
to
think
i
ought
to
let
her
know
i
was
there
for
one
hates
to
eavesdrop
so
i
yelled
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
that
i
was
in
the
hall
waiting
to
go
to
breakfast
and
could
help
hearing
every
word
she
said
however
she
did
mind
a
bit
and
called
to
me
to
come
into
the
telephone
room
i
talking
to
a
friend
of
mine
who
has
just
been
moved
back
to
her
own
apartment
after
getting
over
appendicitis
she
explained
poor
thing
she
such
an
indefatigable
society
woman
and
she
does
so
hate
being
stuck
in
the
city
at
this
season
i
just
been
promising
to
run
in
and
see
her
this
afternoon
and
i
like
to
take
you
if
you
go
she
love
to
see
you
i
introduce
you
now
by
with
that
she
began
to
chat
into
the
thing
again
in
a
chummy
sort
of
way
which
seemed
quite
uncanny
as
i
have
always
looked
upon
a
telephone
as
an
official
kind
of
machine
which
you
prepared
for
with
fasting
and
prayer
and
only
had
recourse
to
when
strictly
necessary
for
important
business
here
lady
betty
said
ess
kay
going
to
introduce
you
now
betty
take
hold
of
the
oh
i
ca
i
do
know
how
i
never
did
i
objected
feeling
as
if
she
were
going
to
force
me
into
taking
gas
against
my
will
she
would
have
me
try
so
i
did
as
it
very
difficult
to
oppose
ess
kay
even
in
the
smallest
thing
but
i
could
hear
a
word
only
a
horrid
buzzing
so
she
had
to
let
me
off
and
just
tell
me
that
the
lady
we
were
to
call
on
was
harvey
richmount
taylour
if
you
going
to
stay
long
in
america
you
have
to
get
used
to
the
said
she
we
do
half
our
shopping
and
some
of
our
calling
and
make
about
all
our
appointments
that
way
if
we
did
there
be
more
cases
of
nervous
prostration
than
there
and
goodness
knows
there
are
enough
now
even
since
blue
rays
have
come
in
many
love
affairs
are
carried
on
practically
entirely
by
and
i
heard
that
in
case
of
necessity
marriage
ceremonies
can
be
performed
by
it
how
about
divorces
i
asked
and
i
was
quite
serious
but
ess
kay
did
seem
to
think
the
question
worth
an
answer
so
she
switched
off
her
friend
and
rang
up
two
or
three
tradespeople
of
whom
she
ordered
scent
and
chocolates
and
some
new
books
and
told
a
manicure
to
call
then
we
went
in
to
breakfast
it
appears
that
the
manicure
person
is
a
great
catch
and
you
are
very
lucky
to
get
him
without
making
an
appointment
long
beforehand
he
does
things
to
your
feet
too
though
i
dared
not
ask
what
and
ess
kay
intended
to
stop
in
for
him
all
the
morning
while
she
was
talking
about
this
sally
was
glancing
over
letters
and
there
was
one
in
which
she
seemed
particularly
interested
she
looked
up
from
it
suddenly
when
ess
kay
said
she
was
not
going
out
and
exclaimed
oh
then
i
may
have
betty
how
nice
i
do
so
want
to
show
her
the
park
i
go
with
you
potter
broke
in
quickly
but
sally
shook
her
head
no
i
want
her
to
myself
thank
you
just
for
this
once
potter
looked
cross
but
said
no
more
and
it
was
arranged
that
sally
and
i
should
start
in
about
an
hour
ess
kay
thought
we
ought
to
get
off
at
once
as
it
would
be
cooler
but
for
some
reason
sally
did
not
like
that
idea
meanwhile
she
ran
out
herself
on
an
errand
but
did
not
offer
to
take
me
even
people
who
have
absolutely
nothing
to
do
except
to
amuse
themselves
appear
to
like
waking
up
and
having
breakfast
much
earlier
than
we
do
this
morning
as
usual
we
had
finished
breakfast
by
half
past
nine
and
by
a
quarter
past
ten
sally
had
come
back
to
fetch
vivace
and
me
for
our
walk
i
had
yet
been
shown
central
park
ess
kay
said
it
was
horrid
out
of
season
but
sally
did
agree
with
her
and
i
thought
it
lovely
more
like
the
bois
de
boulogne
than
our
park
and
yet
with
an
extraordinary
individuality
of
its
own
there
were
only
a
few
people
of
our
sort
riding
or
driving
but
lots
of
children
were
playing
about
and
it
was
wonderful
that
the
trees
and
grass
and
flowers
could
have
kept
so
fresh
through
such
tremendous
heat
i
sure
if
we
had
weather
like
that
in
england
the
whole
vegetable
kingdom
would
go
on
strike
whether
it
was
the
beauty
of
the
park
or
whether
it
was
something
in
herself
i
do
know
but
sally
woodburn
was
in
a
sentimental
mood
she
is
generally
full
of
fun
in
her
soft
quiet
little
way
but
this
morning
she
was
all
poetry
and
romance
she
quoted
tennyson
and
several
modern
american
poets
whose
names
i
was
ashamed
to
say
i
did
even
know
as
their
verses
seemed
charming
and
when
she
had
found
a
certain
narrow
shady
path
which
she
had
been
looking
for
suddenly
she
said
let
talk
about
love
what
do
you
think
about
love
betty
i
do
know
anything
about
it
yet
except
from
books
said
i
mother
does
like
my
reading
modern
novels
much
and
we
have
many
in
the
library
for
vic
reads
french
ones
and
hides
them
but
there
are
other
books
besides
novels
that
tell
about
love
some
heavenly
ones
i
should
think
there
were
said
sally
but
i
did
ask
you
what
you
knew
i
asked
what
you
have
you
ever
thought
about
what
it
would
be
like
to
be
in
love
yes
i
had
to
admit
shamefacedly
for
as
she
is
not
a
man
luckily
it
was
necessary
to
tell
a
fib
have
you
i
once
for
all
said
sally
in
a
changed
voice
that
is
why
i
wanted
to
talk
about
it
to
you
before
you
really
begin
life
over
here
perhaps
it
depends
on
your
opinions
of
love
i
tell
you
my
little
story
i
do
tell
it
to
people
but
maybe
i
will
to
you
this
morning
we
shall
see
is
it
a
sad
story
dear
i
asked
yes
it
sad
perhaps
it
may
end
well
yet
though
i
tried
to
comfort
her
sally
shook
her
head
it
ca
in
this
world
and
the
saddest
part
of
all
is
that
it
was
my
own
fault
but
i
did
understand
the
relative
value
of
things
when
i
lost
the
thing
in
the
world
that
can
make
real
happiness
for
a
woman
i
should
like
to
understand
them
while
you
still
have
time
and
i
should
love
to
hear
your
story
if
it
wo
make
you
too
sad
thinking
of
it
i
said
oh
i
am
always
thinking
of
it
it
never
really
out
of
my
mind
for
a
minute
it
there
you
know
like
an
undertone
just
as
when
you
live
near
the
sea
there
always
the
sound
of
the
waves
underlying
every
other
sound
though
you
may
be
listening
for
it
then
tell
me
i
said
not
yet
i
have
asked
you
the
questions
yet
which
will
show
me
when
you
answer
them
whether
you
need
to
hear
the
story
or
not
could
you
imagine
yourself
marrying
without
first
being
in
love
i
said
thoughtfully
not
when
it
really
to
it
but
vic
says
that
all
nonsense
that
no
woman
no
matter
how
much
she
thinks
herself
in
love
ever
stops
in
love
with
her
husband
the
thing
is
to
marry
a
man
who
will
let
you
do
as
you
like
and
of
course
he
must
be
rich
sally
sighed
well
dear
she
your
sister
and
i
just
nothing
to
you
at
all
but
i
like
to
tell
you
to
forget
about
her
advice
and
not
care
whether
a
man
is
rich
or
poor
or
even
well
born
if
only
himself
a
gentleman
body
and
heart
and
soul
and
is
strong
and
clever
enough
to
take
care
of
you
the
minute
she
said
that
the
image
of
jim
brett
rose
up
before
my
eyes
i
think
though
he
is
poor
and
perhaps
of
humble
birth
that
the
girl
he
marries
will
be
happy
and
well
taken
care
of
you
hear
a
lot
of
talk
about
money
at
newport
she
went
on
too
much
among
some
of
the
people
you
be
with
money
of
more
importance
than
anything
else
two
or
three
rich
young
men
are
certain
to
ask
you
to
marry
them
very
nice
fellows
they
may
be
and
they
will
show
you
heaps
of
attention
all
those
that
cousin
katherine
will
let
come
near
you
and
as
you
so
young
and
inexperienced
you
may
lose
your
head
a
little
bit
but
do
remember
that
losing
your
head
and
being
flattered
and
amused
is
falling
in
love
a
man
must
be
able
to
make
you
love
him
for
himself
and
that
self
must
be
worth
loving
for
nothing
else
is
any
good
in
the
end
and
now
i
tell
you
my
story
just
in
a
few
words
because
it
will
give
you
something
to
think
about
i
now
when
i
was
nineteen
a
year
older
than
you
i
cared
for
a
man
and
he
for
me
we
cared
for
each
other
terribly
but
he
was
poor
and
not
only
that
he
came
from
people
whom
mine
looked
down
upon
we
loved
each
other
so
much
though
that
i
would
have
married
him
in
spite
of
all
but
my
relations
thought
it
would
ruin
my
life
and
they
advised
and
persuaded
and
implored
and
insisted
until
i
was
weak
enough
to
give
the
man
up
they
took
me
to
europe
and
because
i
had
some
money
an
italian
prince
we
met
in
rome
wanted
to
marry
me
they
almost
argued
me
into
consenting
and
though
they
quite
the
news
went
home
to
kentucky
that
i
was
engaged
the
man
i
really
loved
loved
dearly
all
the
time
though
i
was
trying
to
forget
him
believed
it
why
should
he
since
i
given
him
up
for
the
reasons
i
had
he
was
catholic
and
he
went
into
a
monastery
we
have
in
kentucky
and
became
a
monk
no
one
ever
wrote
to
me
about
it
all
my
friends
thought
the
less
i
heard
of
him
the
better
and
two
years
later
when
i
went
back
home
engaged
and
thinking
in
my
heart
that
there
was
and
always
would
be
only
one
man
for
me
in
the
world
it
was
to
learn
that
that
man
had
taken
the
final
vows
which
would
separate
him
from
earthly
love
for
ever
oh
betty
you
do
know
what
i
suffered
i
been
saying
to
myself
that
when
i
saw
him
again
as
i
meant
to
i
would
know
by
his
eyes
at
the
first
glance
whether
he
still
cared
as
much
as
ever
and
if
he
did
i
would
him
to
marry
me
but
i
never
saw
him
again
except
with
the
eyes
of
my
heart
and
i
always
see
him
so
not
an
hour
passes
that
i
do
see
him
so
you
poor
darling
i
exclaimed
and
there
was
a
note
in
her
voice
that
made
my
eyelids
sting
how
little
i
guessed
and
you
seem
so
cheerful
and
even
merry
one
is
in
the
world
to
be
a
wet
blanket
said
sally
besides
one
is
actively
miserable
every
minute
for
years
because
one
has
thrown
away
one
chance
of
real
happiness
one
gets
along
contentedly
enough
except
in
the
bad
hours
when
instead
of
being
a
mild
grey
the
world
is
but
i
have
told
you
this
to
get
sympathy
dear
it
has
been
quite
easy
telling
for
i
do
talk
much
about
the
things
in
myself
i
told
you
in
the
hope
that
remember
me
and
my
wasted
years
if
chance
comes
to
be
happy
even
if
it
should
be
a
chance
which
you
think
in
a
worldly
way
would
be
prudent
or
what
your
people
would
like
people
have
no
to
try
and
order
our
lives
no
matter
how
near
they
may
be
to
us
it
we
who
have
to
live
our
lives
not
they
for
a
minute
we
were
both
silent
and
then
sally
said
quietly
as
if
she
were
glad
to
speak
here
comes
someone
we
seen
before
do
you
recognise
him
and
shall
you
bow
vivace
gave
such
a
leap
that
his
leash
which
i
been
holding
carelessly
was
jerked
out
of
my
hand
it
was
my
brown
man
who
was
coming
jim
brett
my
face
did
feel
red
vivace
was
making
such
a
fuss
over
him
that
sally
could
hardly
help
guessing
whose
the
dog
had
been
before
he
was
mine
but
i
made
the
best
of
it
of
course
i
recognise
him
and
of
course
i
shall
bow
said
i
he
was
kind
to
me
on
the
dock
when
i
was
at
letter
b
sally
did
make
any
remark
about
vivace
capers
though
by
this
time
he
was
wagging
all
over
with
joy
at
his
master
feet
and
jumping
up
to
his
knees
i
was
grateful
to
her
in
another
moment
we
three
had
met
in
the
shady
path
far
away
from
everybody
else
and
vivace
began
running
back
and
forth
between
his
master
and
me
as
if
he
wanted
to
make
us
good
friends
and
not
hurt
either
of
our
feelings
how
do
you
do
said
i
holding
out
my
hand
what
a
coincidence
meeting
you
here
and
my
dear
little
dog
that
sent
me
does
seem
to
take
an
extraordinary
fancy
to
you
does
he
jim
brett
laughed
and
kept
his
hat
off
which
made
him
look
very
nice
with
the
dappling
green
and
gold
light
waving
over
his
thick
short
black
hair
and
his
forehead
which
is
whiter
than
the
rest
of
his
face
he
had
on
better
clothes
than
he
had
worn
on
shipboard
but
they
were
blue
serge
with
the
air
of
having
been
bought
ready
made
at
a
cheap
shop
in
spite
of
them
however
he
looked
very
handsome
and
every
inch
of
him
a
gentleman
i
do
think
many
men
even
in
stan
set
could
wear
those
things
and
look
as
he
did
in
them
though
he
does
have
to
travel
in
the
steerage
i
asked
sally
if
i
might
introduce
brett
to
her
and
she
said
yes
and
smiled
up
so
sweetly
that
i
was
delighted
because
for
all
her
talk
about
nature
noblemen
i
felt
i
did
know
her
well
enough
to
be
quite
sure
how
she
would
take
it
but
she
talked
to
him
charmingly
and
complimented
him
upon
his
bravery
on
shipboard
every
one
of
us
admired
you
for
it
she
said
and
i
very
glad
to
meet
you
this
morning
brett
thanked
her
and
of
course
said
how
pleased
he
was
too
i
am
taking
a
holiday
he
added
looking
at
me
i
was
glad
to
hear
that
because
seeing
him
out
at
this
time
the
thought
had
occurred
to
me
that
he
might
have
lost
his
employment
at
the
club
but
i
only
answered
that
it
was
a
lovely
day
for
a
holiday
and
that
i
did
believe
he
could
find
a
better
place
to
spend
part
of
it
than
in
central
park
have
you
fed
the
squirrels
yet
he
asked
oh
no
can
one
do
that
i
exclaimed
i
should
love
it
may
i
go
and
get
some
peanuts
he
said
to
sally
do
she
said
in
her
pleasant
friendly
way
which
was
just
as
nice
for
him
as
it
had
been
for
stan
or
nicer
we
will
go
on
to
the
wistaria
arbour
and
wait
for
you
there
are
always
lots
of
squirrels
there
vivace
broke
away
from
me
again
and
followed
him
but
still
sally
seemed
to
take
no
notice
that
certainly
a
very
handsome
fellow
she
said
and
we
can
be
sure
that
he
worthy
to
be
trusted
because
the
wrong
sort
of
men
do
jump
overboard
at
sea
to
save
the
lives
of
children
they
do
know
that
is
why
i
feel
perfectly
safe
in
being
nice
to
him
and
letting
you
be
nice
i
reckon
he
is
a
southern
man
how
can
you
tell
i
asked
oh
a
little
by
that
brown
face
of
his
perhaps
but
more
by
his
way
of
speaking
you
english
people
lump
us
all
together
for
our
accent
but
we
can
tell
whether
a
person
is
from
massachusetts
or
new
york
or
illinois
or
kentucky
and
so
on
just
as
you
know
devonshire
from
lancashire
the
wistaria
arbour
which
we
soon
reached
was
like
a
fairy
bower
hung
with
thousands
of
amethyst
lamps
burning
perfume
instead
of
oil
and
the
moment
we
sat
down
a
troop
of
the
fairy
residents
cleverly
disguised
as
grey
squirrels
with
adorable
little
faces
began
excitedly
to
talk
us
over
with
heads
on
one
side
they
criticised
our
features
our
dresses
our
hats
and
finally
approved
of
them
so
far
as
to
decide
that
we
were
creatures
they
might
know
they
stole
nearer
by
twos
by
fours
then
raced
away
again
grey
and
soft
as
undyed
ostrich
feathers
blown
by
the
breeze
when
they
saw
my
brown
man
coming
back
with
vivace
i
was
afraid
that
vivace
would
make
a
dash
and
frighten
them
but
he
evidently
knows
how
to
treat
squirrels
as
equals
not
as
edibles
for
he
behaved
himself
like
the
little
brindled
gentleman
that
he
is
gravely
he
looked
on
as
brett
produced
six
small
brown
paper
bags
crammed
full
of
the
most
extraordinary
objects
they
looked
something
like
wood
carvings
of
unripe
bean
pods
but
it
appeared
that
they
were
peanuts
they
smelt
good
rather
like
coffee
and
when
you
shelled
them
out
of
their
woody
pods
they
were
large
fat
beads
covered
with
a
thin
brown
skin
i
could
help
feeling
as
if
i
had
known
brett
for
a
long
time
as
he
sat
by
us
on
the
bench
under
the
wistaria
helping
sally
and
me
feed
the
squirrels
and
shelling
peanuts
for
us
to
eat
too
i
do
believe
there
must
be
something
special
about
peanuts
which
gives
you
a
homey
sort
of
feeling
if
you
share
them
with
people
they
form
a
sort
of
bond
of
good
fellowship
and
i
fancy
ever
being
prim
with
a
man
after
you
had
eaten
peanuts
with
him
brett
did
tell
us
much
about
himself
but
from
the
few
things
he
did
tell
i
gathered
the
impression
that
he
has
led
an
adventurous
sort
of
life
he
showed
that
he
knows
a
great
deal
about
horses
and
i
rather
hope
he
has
been
a
cowboy
like
the
virginian
in
a
delightful
book
i
have
found
in
ess
kay
library
indeed
i
imagine
the
hero
of
that
story
must
have
looked
like
jim
brett
it
is
a
splendid
type
sally
and
he
talked
about
books
he
spoke
about
some
college
in
the
west
where
he
had
been
and
i
was
glad
that
he
was
a
university
man
though
why
i
should
care
i
do
know
anyway
stan
would
be
at
sea
and
floundering
in
the
subjects
which
my
brown
man
of
the
steerage
and
sally
woodburn
discussed
while
the
squirrels
frisked
about
their
shoulders
but
then
stan
does
care
to
talk
for
too
long
about
anything
except
hunting
or
shooting
or
polo
or
motoring
not
even
bridge
at
which
vic
says
he
loses
a
great
deal
of
money
we
stopped
in
the
wistaria
arbour
for
more
than
an
hour
as
i
knew
by
my
bracelet
watch
when
sally
said
suddenly
we
must
go
though
i
dreamed
till
then
that
we
had
been
half
as
long
i
shook
hands
with
brett
for
and
so
did
sally
but
nobody
spoke
about
our
meeting
again
as
perhaps
we
should
if
he
were
in
ess
kay
set
it
seemed
very
sad
and
irrevocable
somehow
and
i
had
a
heavy
sort
of
feeling
that
life
can
be
full
of
hard
things
his
eyes
looked
wistful
and
i
said
what
i
could
have
said
to
a
man
of
my
own
rank
i
kept
those
roses
you
sent
me
by
that
dear
funny
little
black
boy
all
this
time
in
water
and
they
are
fresh
still
though
a
lot
of
others
i
have
had
since
are
faded
i
told
him
and
in
that
mood
i
did
care
whether
sally
heard
or
not
the
brown
man
face
flushed
up
and
the
wistful
look
in
his
eyes
brightened
into
something
which
i
felt
was
gratitude
for
my
rather
silly
speech
i
think
those
roses
will
hate
to
die
he
said
perhaps
i
shall
press
them
in
a
book
i
answered
to
remind
me
of
my
first
hours
in
america
then
we
parted
and
there
was
a
fuss
with
vivace
who
had
to
be
taken
up
in
my
arms
or
he
would
have
choked
himself
with
his
collar
in
his
desperate
struggles
to
get
free
he
whimpered
even
then
for
a
few
minutes
but
soon
he
was
comforted
and
visibly
made
an
effort
to
content
himself
with
the
fact
that
he
was
my
dog
i
set
him
down
on
the
ground
and
sally
and
i
walked
on
together
without
speaking
but
at
last
she
said
penny
for
your
thoughts
deah
i
was
wondering
about
class
distinctions
in
america
i
answered
i
think
oh
i
think
it
very
silly
of
you
to
have
any
at
all
i
always
supposed
till
i
knew
you
and
that
one
person
was
considered
just
as
good
as
another
in
america
and
it
ought
to
be
like
that
in
a
new
country
where
you
have
an
aristocracy
we
have
two
aristocracies
said
she
we
go
one
better
than
you
for
you
have
only
one
we
have
our
old
families
maybe
they
would
seem
very
old
to
you
and
we
have
wealth
they
both
think
as
much
of
themselves
as
your
aristocracy
does
and
mighty
little
of
each
other
i
could
understand
an
aristocracy
of
brains
in
a
land
like
america
i
went
on
quite
fiercely
but
it
no
good
breaking
off
from
the
old
country
at
all
if
you
to
hamper
yourselves
with
anything
else
now
if
i
had
heard
and
van
der
windt
talking
i
should
have
supposed
that
in
america
a
man
like
brett
for
instance
could
be
received
as
it
is
i
suppose
no
nobody
could
despise
him
for
myself
i
to
know
such
a
brave
man
but
but
of
course
we
not
likely
to
meet
him
again
are
we
in
society
laughed
sally
poor
fellow
it
does
look
much
like
it
now
does
it
though
i
believe
he
a
man
in
a
thousand
and
worth
six
of
any
of
those
that
cousin
katherine
will
let
you
know
counting
potter
though
he
my
relative
it
seems
a
pity
i
said
with
a
sigh
for
the
mistakes
of
the
whole
world
or
something
what
a
pity
oh
i
hardly
know
everything
is
it
yes
and
i
sure
that
what
our
poor
handsome
friend
is
thinking
do
you
suppose
he
minds
i
reckon
he
would
like
to
go
on
being
acquainted
with
you
betty
and
have
the
chances
of
other
men
you
not
an
unattractive
girl
you
know
or
maybe
you
do
know
and
he
human
i
have
a
sort
of
idea
he
try
and
make
some
change
in
his
way
of
life
so
that
it
may
be
possible
to
meet
you
again
when
sally
said
this
i
had
the
oddest
sensation
like
a
prickling
in
all
my
veins
i
longed
to
ask
her
if
she
were
joking
or
if
she
really
did
think
that
jim
brett
was
enough
interested
in
me
to
take
so
much
trouble
but
the
words
came
only
as
far
as
the
tip
of
my
tongue
and
stuck
to
it
as
if
they
had
been
glued
there
vii
about
and
beautiful
ladies
in
the
afternoon
ess
kay
and
i
in
our
thinnest
muslins
went
out
in
the
motor
we
whizzed
up
fifth
avenue
for
several
blocks
as
she
called
them
turned
into
an
side
street
and
stopped
before
one
of
the
most
enormous
buildings
i
ever
saw
in
my
life
it
seemed
only
half
finished
for
the
steel
columns
of
its
skeleton
were
still
visible
around
the
ground
floor
and
the
street
before
it
was
still
cluttered
with
bricks
and
boards
and
rubbish
in
the
hallway
men
were
working
like
active
animals
in
an
immense
cage
suddenly
from
amongst
them
i
saw
emerge
a
beautifully
dressed
little
girl
foaming
with
lace
frills
led
by
a
trained
nurse
in
a
grey
and
white
uniform
they
were
actually
being
let
out
of
the
lift
which
had
swooped
down
with
appalling
swiftness
by
a
man
in
livery
good
heavens
i
exclaimed
what
a
queer
place
for
a
child
and
its
nurse
to
be
in
my
dear
girl
they
live
there
said
ess
kay
rather
scornfully
that
is
harvey
richmount
taylour
little
rosemary
with
her
nurse
people
live
on
top
of
those
poles
like
jack
in
a
beanstalk
i
exclaimed
how
appalling
as
i
looked
through
the
hallway
up
sprang
the
lift
once
more
fierce
and
swift
as
one
of
the
rockets
which
i
used
as
a
child
to
be
afraid
might
strike
the
angels
a
minute
of
suspense
and
it
swooped
down
again
with
two
girls
in
it
i
felt
as
if
it
were
a
thing
i
ought
to
be
seeing
somehow
it
was
so
much
like
spying
on
the
digestive
apparatus
of
a
skeleton
you
see
explained
ess
kay
the
taylours
and
other
people
were
frightfully
anxious
to
get
in
the
rest
of
the
building
will
be
finished
soon
and
this
is
going
to
be
one
of
the
swellest
apartment
houses
in
new
york
this
an
apartment
house
cried
i
thinking
of
the
dull
streets
in
london
where
almost
every
door
has
apartments
printed
over
it
in
gilt
letters
or
else
hanging
crooked
and
dejected
on
a
card
but
oh
perhaps
you
mean
it
for
goodness
sake
do
say
to
margaret
taylour
exclaimed
ess
kay
marshalling
me
into
the
mammoth
skeleton
over
here
only
common
people
live
in
flats
our
sort
have
it
just
the
other
way
round
with
us
i
explained
those
who
have
flats
would
be
furious
if
you
said
they
lived
in
apartments
you
english
are
so
quaint
in
some
ways
remarked
ess
kay
and
though
i
did
answer
i
was
surprised
it
all
well
enough
for
us
to
think
americans
odd
and
we
are
accustomed
to
that
for
everybody
says
they
are
but
that
they
should
think
ways
comic
does
seem
extraordinary
almost
improper
by
this
time
we
were
in
the
lift
which
shut
upon
us
with
a
vicious
snap
and
then
tossed
us
up
towards
the
roof
of
the
world
i
do
hope
one
does
experience
the
same
sensation
in
dying
though
in
that
case
it
would
be
worse
going
down
than
up
before
i
had
time
to
do
more
than
gasp
we
were
at
the
top
and
as
we
waited
for
an
instant
outside
harvey
richmount
taylour
door
i
should
have
liked
to
pinch
my
cheeks
lest
my
fright
had
left
me
pale
vic
has
a
friend
who
lives
in
a
flat
near
the
park
for
the
season
and
once
i
was
taken
there
i
thought
it
quite
beautiful
but
though
the
friend
a
countess
and
very
rich
the
flat
is
poor
compared
with
this
topheavy
nest
of
taylour
in
a
white
where
the
only
spots
of
colour
were
the
roses
masses
of
pink
roses
in
gold
bowls
a
being
was
reclining
in
a
green
and
white
billow
of
a
lace
tea
gown
on
a
white
sofa
she
held
out
both
hands
to
ess
kay
and
looked
at
me
apologising
for
not
getting
up
when
you
come
to
examine
her
the
only
thing
really
about
harvey
richmount
taylour
is
her
way
of
doing
her
hair
it
parted
in
the
middle
and
folds
softly
down
in
brown
wings
on
either
side
of
rather
a
high
forehead
white
enough
to
match
her
she
has
gently
curved
eyebrows
too
but
under
them
her
dark
eyes
are
as
bright
and
sharp
as
a
she
has
pale
skin
red
lips
and
thin
features
with
a
chin
cut
on
the
same
pattern
as
ess
kay
though
it
is
as
square
yet
because
she
is
years
younger
perhaps
not
more
than
ess
kay
introduced
us
in
a
more
precise
way
than
we
have
at
home
and
taylour
said
that
she
was
very
happy
to
meet
me
which
i
should
have
thought
particularly
kind
if
i
had
found
out
that
a
sort
of
formula
which
americans
think
it
polite
to
use
she
talked
to
me
a
good
deal
and
wanted
to
know
how
i
liked
america
of
course
i
was
sure
she
would
do
that
then
ess
kay
explained
that
i
was
interested
in
her
apartment
being
up
so
high
and
thought
her
plucky
to
live
in
it
before
the
house
was
finished
this
amused
taylour
very
much
we
are
just
thankful
to
be
in
it
she
said
i
was
tired
out
with
housekeeping
the
servant
question
is
too
awful
i
see
you
a
trained
for
rosemary
said
ess
kay
we
met
them
going
out
is
rosemary
a
pet
taylour
asked
me
as
if
she
were
speaking
of
somebody
else
little
girl
sweet
i
said
has
she
been
ill
no
do
you
think
she
looks
delicate
it
was
the
hospital
nurse
i
began
but
taylour
laughed
oh
i
suppose
that
strike
you
as
funny
but
we
often
have
them
for
our
children
we
poor
new
york
women
have
so
much
to
do
socially
we
have
to
be
relieved
of
feeling
of
responsibility
if
we
want
to
come
down
with
nervous
prostration
i
shall
hang
onto
this
same
nurse
for
years
if
she
stay
she
good
and
only
ten
dollars
a
week
when
rosemary
grows
up
and
comes
out
she
will
be
her
maid
you
know
lady
betty
do
you
ever
have
trained
in
england
no
i
said
fancy
oh
it
a
splendid
thing
for
a
girl
nothing
like
it
you
see
the
woman
looks
after
her
like
a
maid
and
a
nurse
both
makes
sure
her
bath
the
right
temperature
takes
care
of
her
if
she
gets
the
grippe
sits
up
and
gives
her
beef
tea
or
chocolate
after
balls
massages
her
and
things
like
that
i
used
to
have
one
myself
but
a
woman
after
she
married
is
different
from
a
bud
she
have
a
french
woman
for
her
hair
if
she
respects
herself
i
said
meekly
that
i
supposed
so
and
then
taylour
left
me
to
myself
for
a
few
minutes
while
she
talked
to
ess
kay
they
compared
notes
about
appendicitis
which
they
called
the
fashionable
complaint
and
taylour
suddenly
exclaimed
oh
my
dear
i
have
had
just
smartest
idea
as
soon
as
doctor
pearson
will
let
me
go
to
blue
bay
i
tell
you
i
mean
to
wake
them
up
there
what
i
do
is
to
have
an
appendicitis
lunch
it
be
rather
wo
it
you
the
most
original
thing
exclaimed
ess
kay
how
are
you
going
to
manage
oh
nobody
shall
be
invited
except
those
who
have
had
it
and
the
great
feature
will
be
the
decorations
operating
instruments
you
know
and
hospital
nurses
and
oh
i
do
know
what
all
yet
but
thinking
it
out
it
was
cora
pitchley
cat
lunch
that
put
it
in
my
head
she
turned
to
me
in
america
we
give
women
lunches
she
said
only
women
are
asked
or
a
cat
lunch
could
be
worked
is
it
so
with
you
too
i
afraid
our
women
would
think
it
a
bore
if
there
were
no
men
i
answered
anyway
there
always
are
some
i
believe
i
not
out
yet
do
tell
about
the
cat
lunch
oh
it
was
only
a
pretty
smart
trick
of
my
friend
pitchley
she
was
a
rich
young
widow
from
the
west
with
millions
and
very
pretty
and
lively
so
some
of
the
old
cats
snubbed
her
and
tried
to
keep
her
out
of
new
york
society
when
i
was
introducing
her
around
but
she
got
her
foot
in
at
last
so
tight
they
could
help
themselves
for
the
van
tortens
took
her
up
and
she
was
so
what
did
she
do
but
give
a
big
lunch
inviting
all
the
women
who
had
been
the
meanest
to
her
and
not
another
soul
the
table
decoration
consisted
of
cats
vases
made
of
cats
shaped
like
cats
and
a
little
gold
cat
with
emerald
eyes
for
each
woman
to
take
away
with
her
so
she
would
forget
the
lunch
in
a
hurry
and
would
you
believe
it
not
one
of
them
saw
the
joke
till
got
hold
of
it
and
published
an
account
of
the
function
next
week
what
did
the
women
do
i
asked
nothing
but
feel
cattier
than
before
she
richer
than
ever
now
for
she
married
a
man
worth
twenty
millions
and
the
first
thing
he
did
was
to
give
orders
to
céleste
her
dressmaker
to
turn
out
two
new
dresses
for
his
wife
every
week
of
the
year
without
fail
not
one
of
them
to
cost
less
than
two
hundred
and
fifty
dollars
it
was
such
a
strain
on
céleste
thinking
of
new
ideas
that
she
had
to
give
it
up
after
the
first
year
though
it
nearly
broke
her
heart
i
should
have
thought
it
would
be
a
strain
having
the
dresses
to
wear
said
i
fancy
getting
passionately
attached
to
one
frock
but
never
being
able
to
wear
it
more
than
once
or
twice
on
account
of
your
duty
to
the
new
ones
always
coming
towards
you
in
a
long
relentless
procession
down
the
years
i
should
hate
it
i
would
said
taylour
i
ca
have
too
many
new
things
and
i
always
change
each
scrap
of
furniture
and
decoration
in
my
own
rooms
every
year
so
that
taylour
wo
get
tired
of
them
he
such
a
nervous
man
but
you
meet
cora
pitchley
at
newport
her
house
is
there
she
a
type
of
an
american
woman
just
as
bright
as
she
can
be
her
second
husband
was
a
wholesale
dry
goods
man
years
ago
but
most
people
have
forgotten
that
now
he
worth
his
millions
and
he
got
the
most
gorgeous
place
quite
like
one
of
your
old
castles
the
worst
of
it
is
his
mother
lives
with
them
and
when
she
was
showing
the
bride
cora
over
the
house
which
was
decorated
pretty
weirdly
for
the
first
wife
the
old
lady
kept
explaining
is
the
louis
seize
room
this
is
the
queen
anne
room
cora
just
looked
at
the
things
and
said
makes
you
think
so
smart
was
it
but
cora
changed
everything
inside
the
house
now
she
loves
change
she
even
changed
her
birthday
so
as
to
have
it
in
leap
year
and
as
for
her
mind
she
changes
it
entirely
at
least
six
times
a
day
says
that
why
women
have
nicer
minds
than
men
they
change
them
oftener
but
i
gossiped
enough
about
a
person
you
do
know
lady
betty
let
talk
about
england
i
run
over
to
paris
for
a
month
or
two
most
years
but
only
been
twice
to
england
i
did
all
the
sights
though
did
miss
anything
i
gave
four
days
to
london
alone
candidly
i
do
think
your
women
dress
nearly
as
well
as
we
do
or
hold
themselves
as
well
but
perhaps
you
more
looking
take
you
all
in
all
i
do
mean
anything
of
course
but
i
think
your
men
are
lovely
i
met
a
perfectly
charming
member
of
parliament
and
he
invited
me
to
tea
on
the
terrace
such
strawberries
and
cream
but
afraid
i
hurt
his
feelings
i
said
i
could
help
thinking
of
commons
a
most
insulting
name
and
if
we
called
our
senate
anything
like
that
we
could
get
an
american
man
who
respected
himself
to
go
into
it
but
english
people
are
so
queer
they
do
seem
to
mind
admitting
that
there
is
a
class
above
theirs
betty
does
need
to
know
anything
about
that
said
ess
kay
she
is
on
the
highest
pinnacle
oh
dear
no
said
i
there
are
the
royalties
do
you
think
you
are
just
as
asked
taylour
i
never
thought
about
it
in
that
way
i
answered
stupidly
for
of
course
i
had
surely
you
do
bob
to
them
indeed
we
do
i
protested
well
then
i
said
taylour
firmly
i
have
my
head
cut
off
first
especially
before
i
curtsey
to
a
man
quite
a
colour
flew
into
her
face
as
she
asserted
her
independence
and
ess
kay
must
have
seen
that
the
invalid
was
getting
excited
for
she
rose
quickly
to
go
come
betty
said
she
and
i
came
the
lift
plunged
us
down
through
the
inner
workings
of
the
skeleton
i
had
the
sensation
that
it
was
dropping
away
from
under
my
feet
and
that
as
i
dangled
above
it
like
a
wobbly
little
balloon
my
head
had
been
left
behind
somewhere
near
the
top
but
i
did
leave
my
heart
behind
in
taylour
flat
viii
about
newport
and
gorgeousness
i
was
anxious
to
travel
in
an
american
train
so
ess
kay
said
we
might
go
by
rail
to
newport
instead
of
by
boat
as
she
had
intended
i
know
it
was
very
wrong
in
principle
but
when
we
got
to
the
grand
central
station
or
depot
as
perhaps
i
ought
to
call
it
i
did
wish
that
slavery
existed
again
so
that
i
could
have
bought
two
or
three
of
those
delightful
porters
in
grey
livery
and
red
caps
there
were
several
i
would
have
given
anything
to
have
to
take
home
with
me
and
make
pets
of
but
i
suppose
even
if
they
had
been
for
sale
they
would
have
come
too
expensive
and
i
should
have
had
to
give
them
up
for
their
eyes
alone
to
say
nothing
of
their
pleasant
white
grins
would
have
been
worth
pounds
and
pounds
as
for
their
voices
they
were
the
sweetest
i
heard
in
america
soft
and
a
little
throaty
with
a
peculiar
quality
quite
different
from
the
voice
of
a
person
who
has
been
dipped
in
au
with
their
vivid
red
caps
their
brilliant
eyes
and
their
smiles
they
looked
to
me
more
like
great
wonderful
tropical
birds
than
human
beings
and
they
seemed
so
in
their
good
nature
that
sure
all
the
things
that
serious
and
learned
people
say
in
england
about
the
dangers
of
the
increasing
coloured
population
in
america
must
be
nonsense
serious
and
learned
people
do
make
such
mistakes
through
never
seeing
the
fun
in
anything
and
every
few
years
they
find
out
that
they
have
been
quite
wrong
in
what
they
have
taught
with
so
much
trouble
about
comets
and
microbes
and
men
and
other
progressive
things
we
had
a
number
of
these
tropical
birds
that
have
been
tamed
to
serve
the
railway
to
help
us
with
our
bags
and
things
getting
into
the
train
although
there
were
louise
and
a
couple
of
ess
footmen
as
well
i
looked
at
their
brown
hands
and
they
were
quite
pink
inside
as
pink
as
mine
i
do
know
why
this
gave
me
a
shock
but
it
did
perhaps
one
had
the
feeling
that
the
nice
creatures
were
only
painted
to
play
their
parts
or
that
their
white
souls
just
like
ours
were
striking
through
their
skins
it
was
a
beautiful
train
even
the
engine
was
different
from
our
kind
much
fiercer
and
reared
its
head
higher
like
a
wild
stag
compared
to
a
stout
but
reliable
ox
our
carriage
had
no
compartments
in
it
but
was
just
one
long
wide
moving
corridor
all
plate
glass
windows
and
mirrors
and
painted
panels
and
velvet
arm
chairs
dotted
about
rather
like
a
hotel
on
wheels
there
were
a
good
many
people
in
it
when
we
got
in
which
annoyed
ess
kay
so
much
that
she
wished
she
had
borrowed
a
private
car
from
a
friend
who
would
have
loved
lending
it
but
i
was
glad
she
had
for
the
people
were
part
of
the
fun
ess
kay
was
sure
they
were
nobodies
because
she
did
happen
to
know
any
of
their
faces
but
perhaps
they
were
thinking
the
same
thing
about
her
anyway
they
were
mostly
women
and
all
pretty
and
perfectly
dressed
as
even
quite
common
people
appear
to
be
in
america
i
have
caught
sight
of
a
dowdy
woman
since
i
came
none
of
their
frocks
hitch
up
in
front
and
dip
down
behind
as
you
see
people
doing
if
you
are
taken
to
a
shop
in
oxford
street
or
even
sometimes
in
bond
street
and
their
belts
always
point
beautifully
down
at
the
waist
although
it
the
season
in
new
york
the
train
was
a
fast
one
and
simply
hurled
itself
and
us
through
space
as
if
we
had
got
onto
the
tail
of
a
comet
by
mistake
but
it
hardly
waggled
at
all
so
that
we
could
have
studied
the
scenery
nicely
if
we
had
been
able
to
see
it
behind
the
advertisements
passing
the
outskirts
of
new
york
it
seemed
as
if
every
villa
even
the
quite
smart
ones
did
their
own
washing
the
gardens
which
sally
told
me
to
call
back
yards
were
just
as
full
of
clean
clothes
as
the
meadows
were
of
advertisement
hoardings
and
i
rather
wondered
why
some
enterprising
agents
did
go
round
and
offer
the
people
big
prices
for
painting
uneeda
biscuit
on
their
petticoats
and
shirts
we
tore
through
such
charming
places
with
fascinating
houses
built
of
wood
among
parks
of
feathery
green
trees
that
i
was
sure
newport
could
be
no
prettier
but
ess
kay
spoiled
the
most
picturesque
one
for
me
by
saying
that
it
was
practically
settled
by
retired
butchers
and
tailors
according
to
ess
kay
and
her
brother
all
you
have
to
do
to
be
sure
of
being
rich
in
america
is
to
decide
to
be
either
a
tailor
or
a
butcher
so
it
seems
quite
simple
and
i
surprised
that
everybody
does
do
it
only
if
you
do
it
appears
there
is
no
use
in
your
going
to
newport
until
you
lived
it
down
which
of
course
must
be
a
drawback
just
as
i
had
got
rather
giddy
from
looking
out
of
the
window
a
boy
exactly
like
the
boys
in
melodrama
who
begin
by
selling
papers
and
end
by
saving
the
heroine
from
the
villain
came
into
the
car
piled
up
to
his
head
with
novels
and
magazines
he
scattered
a
lot
over
us
like
manna
without
asking
us
to
pay
but
just
as
i
had
got
passionately
interested
in
a
short
story
he
came
back
and
began
to
gather
everything
up
seeing
that
i
clung
to
my
lot
potter
bought
them
all
for
me
before
i
could
stop
him
there
were
two
books
and
four
magazines
with
superlatively
young
men
and
divinely
lovely
girls
for
the
heroes
and
heroines
the
story
i
was
most
interested
in
had
a
hero
like
brett
but
it
was
disappointing
in
the
end
because
he
married
a
short
plump
girl
with
black
eyes
and
somehow
it
spoiled
the
realism
as
i
could
fancy
he
would
really
have
cared
so
dreadfully
for
a
girl
like
that
anyway
it
put
me
out
of
the
mood
for
reading
any
more
stories
and
i
began
glancing
over
the
advertisements
at
least
i
glanced
at
first
but
soon
i
was
absorbed
for
they
were
wonderful
i
had
never
dreamed
that
there
were
such
kind
thoughtful
men
in
business
as
the
ones
who
advertised
in
those
fat
american
magazines
and
so
clever
too
they
seemed
to
have
spent
their
whole
past
lives
simply
in
studying
things
so
that
eventually
they
could
make
you
happy
and
save
you
trouble
they
lived
only
for
that
those
incredibly
nice
men
there
were
photographs
of
some
of
them
with
their
advertisements
so
that
you
could
know
what
they
were
really
like
and
have
even
more
confidence
in
them
than
you
would
if
you
had
seen
their
style
of
features
there
were
two
or
three
whose
profiles
i
could
get
to
feel
at
home
with
even
if
i
had
been
born
with
one
of
them
but
the
majority
were
brave
energetic
oh
terribly
men
as
indeed
they
would
need
to
be
if
they
were
really
to
accomplish
all
the
things
they
promised
not
only
for
you
but
for
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
other
people
who
might
be
inclined
to
put
them
to
the
test
there
were
things
like
this
in
the
magazines
all
the
magazines
listen
to
me
miss
or
madam
i
have
something
to
say
which
will
interest

want

perfect

and
we
will
arrange
everything
for

better
than
you
could
yourself
with
no
trouble
to
you
and
your
servants
there
were
so
many
splendid
things
to
have
to
wear
and
to
eat
advertised
in
the
same
kind
fatherly
way
that
i
felt
as
if
i
had
unconsciously
yearned
for
each
one
of
them
more
than
for
anything
else
in
my
life
and
now
it
had
been
put
into
my
head
in
all
its
fatal
fascination
i
could
possible
exist
another
day
without
sending
for
it
to
one
in
that
procession
of
noble
american
advertisers
i
felt
too
that
if
anything
disagreeable
should
happen
to
me
like
a
railway
or
motor
car
accident
i
could
spend
the
rest
of
my
existence
lying
down
and
still
the
splendid
things
would
come
running
to
me
if
i
just
or
flung
a
stamp
into
space
i
mentioned
something
of
the
sort
to
sally
i
wonder
they
do
offer
to
choose
you
a
husband
said
i
i
did
know
advertisements
could
be
so
interesting
what
about
your
own
she
asked
they
a
hundred
times
quainter
i
thought
hard
about
the
and
but
remember
anything
extraordinary
in
the
advertising
line
and
said
so
perhaps
you
being
english
do
see
anything
extraordinary
about
a
clergyman
wife
offering
to
exchange
a
canary
bird
for
six
subscription
to
or
the
widow
of
an
officer
earnestly
desiring
an
idiot
lady
to
board
with
her
or
a
decayed
gentlewoman
inviting
the
public
to
give
her
five
pounds
but
we
being
american
replied
sally
why
i
rather
read
the
advertisements
in
some
of
your
morning
papers
and
ladies
weeklies
than
i
would
eat
talking
of
eating
it
said
potter
there
be
a
big
menagerie
feeding
in
the
but
there
no
good
waiting
for
it
to
finish
as
then
there
be
no
food
left
so
we
took
his
suggestion
and
there
was
a
crowd
but
he
had
secured
a
table
for
four
and
we
squeezed
ourselves
into
the
places
i
have
travelled
abroad
with
mother
and
vic
where
there
were
americans
in
the
and
they
have
been
cross
because
they
did
get
served
quickly
and
they
have
said
things
but
in
this
car
going
to
newport
you
forgot
what
you
had
had
last
before
the
next
course
came
yet
nobody
seemed
to
mind
they
were
as
patient
as
lambs
and
simply
took
what
was
given
them
when
they
could
get
it
although
they
looked
as
if
they
were
used
to
everything
very
nice
at
home
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
because
they
were
all
americans
together
eating
american
things
with
american
waiters
to
wait
upon
them
and
no
foreigners
who
ought
to
know
they
would
stand
that
sort
of
nonsense
hanged
if
they
would
some
of
ess
kay
servants
had
gone
on
before
us
and
some
were
in
our
train
exactly
how
it
was
managed
i
do
know
but
things
that
would
worry
us
into
graves
do
seem
to
bother
americans
at
all
and
there
was
the
motor
waiting
when
we
arrived
at
the
end
of
our
journey
with
a
private
motor
omnibus
for
the
servants
and
luggage
sometimes
it
is
rather
a
pretty
sight
at
the
station
where
you
have
to
get
out
for
battlemead
or
for
the
village
when
one
of
the
best
trains
from
town
comes
in
especially
if
mother
or
anyone
at
other
big
places
in
the
neighbourhood
should
be
having
a
house
party
there
are
several
rather
good
victorias
with
nice
sleek
horses
a
handsome
brougham
or
two
a
motor
car
or
two
to
say
nothing
of
dog
carts
and
phaetons
but
it
is
a
poor
show
compared
to
the
scene
at
newport
i
felt
suddenly
as
if
i
were
at
the
theatre
and
the
curtain
had
just
gone
up
on
a
brilliant
new
act
there
was
a
crowd
of
gorgeous
carriages
and
varnish
gold
and
silver
harness
and
horses
brown
and
chestnut
backs
all
glittered
blindingly
in
the
sun
but
there
were
even
more
motors
than
carriages
it
seemed
or
else
they
were
more
conspicuous
and
many
were
being
driven
by
beautiful
girls
in
muslins
such
as
we
would
wear
to
a
garden
party
with
nothing
on
their
pretty
heads
except
their
splendid
hair
dressed
everlastingly
in
the
same
way
now
i
saw
ess
kay
and
potter
in
their
element
there
was
no
suggestion
that
the
people
were
not
good
enough
for
them
here
ess
kay
radiated
smiles
bowing
cordially
right
and
left
sometimes
even
more
cordially
than
her
friends
bowed
in
return
potter
was
taking
off
his
straw
hat
and
waving
it
there
were
evidently
no
nobodies
here
they
were
delighted
to
see
everybody
for
everybody
was
somebody
and
some
but
not
all
of
the
everybodies
were
delighted
to
see
them
sally
alone
remained
unmoved
and
i
was
glad
to
have
her
to
keep
me
in
countenance
in
this
new
act
where
i
knew
none
of
the
players
or
what
part
i
should
be
called
upon
to
take
by
and
by
i
had
heard
so
much
that
was
dazzling
about
newport
which
i
had
imagined
a
great
white
city
by
the
sea
that
the
part
i
saw
first
after
leaving
the
railway
station
was
distinctly
a
blow
quiet
village
the
greatest
watering
place
of
america
perhaps
of
the
world
i
said
to
myself
almost
scornfully
but
when
we
had
bowled
into
bellevue
avenue
where
ess
kay
said
that
her
cottage
was
i
began
to
understand
i
was
sure
at
first
sight
what
i
did
think
of
the
great
splendid
houses
with
mere
lawns
such
as
people
would
have
for
suburban
villas
at
home
but
they
gave
me
a
tremendous
impression
of
concentrated
wealth
this
seemed
a
place
where
everybody
was
rich
where
millions
were
at
a
discount
and
i
thought
whatever
else
i
did
think
that
it
would
be
a
place
to
stop
away
from
unless
you
were
happy
happy
and
strong
and
gay
but
there
was
one
thing
i
was
very
sure
of
the
avenue
itself
was
more
full
than
our
park
in
the
topmost
height
of
the
season
people
do
look
happy
driving
in
the
park
not
even
the
pretty
people
i
have
found
that
whenever
i
have
been
and
though
that
so
very
often
yet
vic
says
it
is
really
and
truly
always
the
same
the
great
beauties
look
bored
and
some
of
them
have
their
faces
painted
and
the
air
of
wearing
transformations
but
not
one
of
the
charming
women
driving
up
and
down
bellevue
avenue
that
afternoon
looked
bored
and
hardly
any
were
painted
i
never
saw
people
appear
to
be
so
delighted
with
life
and
so
thoroughly
alive
as
if
the
glorious
sea
air
were
frothing
in
their
veins
like
champagne
in
the
park
you
do
see
people
laughing
and
talking
to
each
other
in
carriages
they
simply
lean
back
on
the
cushions
with
an
expression
that
seems
to
say
this
is
the
only
thing
i
can
think
of
to
do
so
doing
it
just
to
kill
time
probably
they
do
really
feel
like
that
but
they
look
it
and
as
for
the
people
who
sit
and
watch
or
stand
and
wait
they
usually
a
strained
expression
in
their
eyes
as
if
they
were
afraid
of
missing
somebody
or
something
of
importance
but
here
in
bellevue
avenue
everybody
was
smiling
and
chatting
and
i
noticed
that
the
men
were
so
preternaturally
alert
as
the
men
in
new
york
some
had
actually
taken
time
to
get
fat
which
so
far
i
had
reason
to
suppose
was
a
thing
that
never
happened
to
american
men
and
somehow
the
young
girls
had
the
air
of
being
a
great
deal
more
important
than
we
are
at
home
you
could
tell
from
the
very
way
they
sat
and
held
up
their
heads
in
the
motor
cars
and
dog
carts
and
other
things
that
they
thought
the
world
was
theirs
and
they
were
people
to
know
in
it
one
was
driving
a
tandem
and
she
did
look
more
than
seventeen
i
was
glad
when
she
bowed
to
ess
kay
because
she
was
pretty
and
i
made
up
my
mind
that
i
should
like
to
know
her
that
cora
pitchley
carolyn
said
ess
kay
do
you
remember
margaret
taylour
telling
anecdotes
of
cora
she
bother
much
with
the
girl
people
are
talking
about
them
both
rather
a
lot
this
year
they
say
carolyn
i
repeated
what
a
pretty
name
and
how
somehow
fancy
her
driving
tandem
with
only
that
tiny
groom
if
anything
should
happen
she
must
be
plucky
how
old
is
she
eighteen
she
was
one
of
last
october
buds
october
buds
i
repeated
it
sounds
poetical
but
unseasonable
potter
answered
with
a
laugh
yes
we
like
things
out
of
season
in
america
so
we
bring
out
most
of
our
buds
in
october
then
they
have
the
whole
winter
to
bloom
in
you
know
before
they
grafted
on
another
stalk
here
comes
cora
herself
now
in
tom
doremus

it
must
make
van
der
windt
wild
his
going
so
much
with
the
pitchley
lot
as
she
ca
stand
them
and
would
keep
cora
and
carolyn
out
of
everything
in
newport
if
she
could
i
did
wonder
at
doremus
though
as
i
bowed
to
him
and
found
time
to
know
exactly
how
pitchley
looked
and
what
she
wore
in
the
half
second
before
our
two
motors
flashed
apart
i
thought
her
splendidly
handsome
and
i
liked
the
gleam
in
her
dark
grey
eyes
which
promised
fun
but
just
then
our
chauffeur
slowed
down
before
a
house
which
seemed
to
cover
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
ground
welcome
to
my
little
cottage
dear
betty
said
ess
kay
if
this
is
her
idea
of
a
cottage
i
do
know
what
her
conception
of
a
castle
must
be
and
yet
when
you
come
to
analyse
it
there
really
is
something
about
the
place
which
suggests
a
kind
of
glorified
titanic
cottage
rather
too
grand
for
a
king
unless
he
were
a
fairy
king
but
possibly
suited
to
an
emperor
but
i
do
believe
rich
americans
think
that
what
is
good
enough
for
a
king
is
only
good
enough
for
them
at
a
pinch
and
i
heard
ess
kay
call
windsor
dreadfully
shabby
her
cottage
looks
as
it
were
built
of
grey
satinwood
but
it
is
really
shingles
and
shingles
can
be
the
loveliest
material
imaginable
it
seems
for
the
covering
of
a
house
especially
with
a
foundation
of
granite
sparkling
with
mica
they
are
soft
and
shimmery
in
their
tints
these
shingles
as
a
dove
breast
some
are
dark
some
light
but
all
are
feathery
in
effect
and
altogether
the
moorings
with
its
gables
and
porches
and
bow
windows
and
balconies
and
wide
verandahs
gives
the
effect
of
a
huge
ruffly
and
motherly
grey
bird
with
her
wings
spread
wide
to
shelter
her
birdlings
i
felt
quite
content
to
be
one
of
the
birdlings
as
i
went
in
i
am
sorry
to
say
i
not
a
bit
fonder
of
ess
kay
than
i
was
in
the
ship
but
the
cottage
looked
so
hospitable
and
jolly
and
the
air
and
the
sunshine
sparkled
so
that
i
could
help
feeling
that
it
was
pleasant
to
be
young
and
alive
and
on
the
threshold
of
amusing
new
adventures
i
was
happy
and
i
would
have
liked
to
sing
i
wanted
to
be
very
good
friends
with
everybody
including
potter
and
i
fell
in
love
with
the
house
the
minute
i
set
foot
on
the
front
verandah
the
great
gorgeous
palace
in
new
york
is
far
grander
of
course
and
must
have
cost
four
or
five
times
as
much
still
only
very
rich
people
could
have
built
and
furnished
the
moorings
or
afford
to
live
in
it
there
is
a
big
square
hall
not
to
be
compared
to
ours
at
battlemead
of
course
though
the
persian
rugs
and
the
pictures
are
fine
but
the
staircase
is
peculiarly
charming
it
looks
a
staircase
made
for
sitting
out
dances
with
men
you
like
and
evidently
it
knows
its
value
as
a
flirting
place
and
lives
up
to
it
for
there
are
fat
silk
and
satin
cushions
resting
invitingly
against
the
wall
on
each
one
of
the
shallow
steps
most
of
the
rooms
are
enormous
and
consist
half
of
quaint
leaded
windows
with
seats
underneath
but
better
than
anything
else
is
the
verandah
which
runs
all
round
the
house
and
is
not
only
as
wide
as
a
room
but
is
fitted
up
like
a
succession
of
rooms
the
delicate
bead
curtains
that
glitter
like
a
rain
of
green
and
white
and
jewels
give
you
a
feeling
of
privacy
for
you
can
see
through
them
without
being
seen
the
satiny
grey
floor
is
half
covered
with
exquisite
rugs
and
everywhere
there
are
oriental
tables
and
chairs
and
cushiony
sofas
and
green
hammocks
with
frilly
pink
pillows
and
screens
and
bowers
of
palms
and
bright
azaleas
i
should
like
to
live
on
that
verandah
swinging
slowly
in
a
hammock
and
looking
through
the
cascade
of
glittering
beads
at
the
sea
and
sky
i
spoke
this
thought
out
aloud
but
potter
said
i
would
soon
learn
that
there
was
much
time
in
newport
for
looking
at
the
sea
and
sky
why
is
that
partly
what
you
come
to
newport
for
i
asked
they
all
laughed
you
just
wait
and
find
out
answered
potter
and
we
work
you
pretty
hard
doing
it
ess
kay
and
sally
took
me
up
to
show
me
my
room
and
theirs
and
potter
said
that
he
would
go
round
and
look
in
at
the
casino
but
he
would
come
back
and
have
tea
with
us
as
soon
as
he
had
seen
what
there
was
doing
each
bedroom
is
done
in
a
colour
and
mine
is
the
white
room
it
was
almost
too
with
some
powerful
flower
fragrance
when
we
went
in
for
an
instant
i
could
not
think
what
it
was
but
in
another
moment
i
had
seen
on
tables
and
cabinets
and
window
shelves
great
bowls
of
water
lilies
rising
out
of
their
dark
leaves
like
moons
out
of
cloud
banks
from
potter
said
ess
kay
he
telegraphed
for
them
to
be
here
and
sent
word
to
the
servants
just
how
he
wanted
them
arranged
i
must
say
he
does
think
of
rather
pretty
things
when
he
cares
to
please
and
he
care
to
please
you
betty
but
you
know
that
without
my
telling
you
do
you
my
lady
witch
it
was
of
me
but
all
my
pleasure
in
the
gleaming
white
beauties
went
out
like
a
bursting
bubble
it
gets
on
my
nerves
to
be
grateful
to
potter
three
or
four
times
a
day
nevertheless
when
he
came
back
which
he
did
after
we
had
dressed
and
were
having
tea
behind
the
rain
of
glittering
glass
i
had
to
thank
him
prettily
he
was
pleased
but
was
evidently
thinking
about
something
else
i
did
get
to
the
casino
after
all
said
he
i
met
pitchley
going
out
to
make
a
call
she
was
on
her
way
home
it
seems
when
we
met
her
and
she
offered
to
turn
back
if
i
go
with
her
so
i
did
now
see
here
potter
parker
broke
in
ess
kay
i
do
wish
you
to
set
up
as
another
of
cora
pitchley
champions
it
all
very
well
for
margaret
taylour
to
be
forever
quoting
her
and
she
is
fun
but
she
goes
around
being
original
in
the
wrong
way
that
nobody
admires
that
is
she
does
what
she
wants
and
not
what
other
people
want
her
to
do
margaret
spends
her
summers
at
blue
bay
and
i
spend
mine
at
newport
and
i
not
going
to
have
van
der
windt
down
on
me
or
on
my
brother
either
if
i
can
help
it
thanks
for
good
advice
replied
potter
airily
but
may
be
when
you
hear
what
pitchley
had
to
say
to
me
you
change
your
tune
ess
kay
raised
her
eyebrows
but
her
eyes
would
look
curious
what
could
cora
pitchley
say
that
would
have
any
particular
effect
on
me
she
asked
she
knows
for
a
fact
that
she
is
to
be
asked
to
the
pink
ball
on
the
and
that
van
der
windt
herself
scratched
your
name
off
the
list
before
she
sailed
for
europe
ess
kay
face
went
a
dull
ugly
red
and
she
laughed
a
loud
laugh
which
sounded
as
if
it
would
be
the
same
colour
as
for
cora
i
can
understand
but
i
do
believe
the
woman
would
have
dared
to
try
to
exclude
she
said
in
a
quivery
voice
why
should
she
have
dared
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
well
anyhow
she
do
dare
no
naturally
she
wo
dare
now
you
as
smart
as
they
make
kath
then
for
some
reason
they
both
turned
and
gazed
at
me
with
a
sort
of
look
while
sally
examined
the
grounds
in
her
with
that
funny
little
smile
of
hers
was
that
the
thing
you
thought
would
change
me
toward
cora
pitchley
asked
ess
kay
yes
i
thought
it
would
give
you
a
sort
of
fellow
feeling
it
does
said
she
shortly
and
nobody
but
a
man
could
have
thought
it
would
it
makes
me
feel
all
the
more
that
i
do
want
to
be
mixed
up
with
her
for
for
betty
sake
potter
whistled
with
one
thumb
in
a
breast
pocket
for
the
sake
he
remarked
dramatically
and
ess
kay
looked
angry
i
sha
invite
the
pitchleys
to
my
big
affair
said
she
the
affair
i
going
to
have
for
betty
oh
but
you
must
please
not
put
yourself
out
for
me
i
exclaimed
i
should
be
so
sorry
to
have
you
do
that
potter
laughed
do
you
try
to
rob
her
of
her
dearest
triumph
lady
daisy
you
the
big
gem
for
the
middle
of
the
setting
you
the
kohinoor
potter
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
yourself
talking
to
her
like
that
said
ess
kay
but
all
he
means
betty
is
that
i
shall
be
very
glad
to
do
anything
i
can
to
make
your
visit
pleasant
and
it
will
be
no
trouble
at
all
for
me
to
give
an
entertainment
you
may
be
quite
sure
she
said
this
as
the
queen
might
say
that
it
did
matter
to
her
whether
there
were
people
or
asked
to
a
garden
party
and
i
realised
that
i
was
snubbed
so
i
said
no
more
ix
about
bathing
a
dress
and
an
earl
ess
kay
had
a
headache
next
morning
and
stopped
in
bed
she
could
speak
or
be
spoken
to
and
so
we
could
possibly
ask
her
advice
about
going
to
bailey
beach
for
a
dip
in
the
sea
potter
whose
proposal
it
was
said
that
this
was
perhaps
providential
as
she
was
almost
certain
to
want
me
to
stay
in
till
i
could
be
taken
out
officially
but
you
do
need
to
know
that
he
added
i
looked
at
sally
and
she
laughed
so
i
knew
that
i
was
to
go
oh
but
what
about
bathing
clothes
i
exclaimed
on
a
sudden
thought
how
stupid
of
me
not
to
have
remembered
that
i
would
want
them
before
i
left
home
or
in
new
york
i
reckon
it
would
have
been
stupid
of
us
if
had
remembered
said
sally
then
she
went
on
irrelevantly
it
seemed
at
first
what
day
of
the
month
is
the
of
july
said
potter
promptly
while
i
was
resigning
myself
after
a
slight
struggle
to
the
fact
that
i
had
lost
track
of
dates
seem
to
me
that
somebody
birthday
is
it
sally
appeared
to
address
her
remark
to
the
ceiling
how
you
know
i
exclaimed
a
little
bird
told
me
the
kind
that
builds
in
birthday
books
it
lives
on
a
table
in
lady
victoria
fancy
your
keeping
the
date
in
your
head
all
this
time
i
a
weakness
for
remembering
birthdays
when
i
fond
of
the
people
who
own
them
you
see
everybody
thinks
about
christmas
and
i
want
to
be
confused
with
everybody
in
the
minds
of
just
those
special
people
now
the
truth
is
i
got
a
little
birthday
present
upstairs
which
i
did
mean
you
should
see
until
tomorrow
but
as
part
of
it
may
come
in
rather
handy
this
morning
perhaps
we
might
run
up
and
have
a
look
at
it
oh
sally
you
dear
i
exclaimed
oh
sally
you
wretch
to
have
kept
that
birthday
to
yourself
i
want
to
be
on
in
this
act
grumbled
potter
but
i
hardly
heard
him
i
was
so
excited
about
what
i
was
going
to
find
upstairs
we
went
to
my
room
sally
and
i
and
she
rang
for
louise
who
was
told
to
fetch
from
what
sally
called
her
closet
a
certain
black
trunk
of
whose
existence
louise
was
evidently
already
aware
it
was
a
box
big
enough
to
hold
two
or
three
dresses
and
when
it
was
opened
by
sally
after
louise
had
gone
it
proved
to
contain
three
and
a
half
one
of
the
three
was
a
blue
gauze
ball
gown
embroidered
with
patterns
of
thistles
in
tiny
sparkling
things
that
looked
like
diamonds
the
second
was
pink
tulle
with
garlands
of
tiny
roses
the
third
was
a
white
linen
made
as
only
americans
know
how
to
make
up
linens
and
the
half
was
well
i
was
not
quite
sure
what
it
was
at
first
though
i
could
see
that
it
was
pretty
it
was
pale
green
and
there
were
two
parts
of
it
the
bigger
of
the
two
it
was
not
very
big
was
of
soft
silk
and
extremely
fluffy
it
had
a
and
bodice
and
attached
to
that
was
a
skirt
or
something
that
would
have
been
a
skirt
if
it
had
had
more
time
to
grow
the
second
part
was
silk
too
but
more
difficult
to
describe
perhaps
i
do
best
to
say
that
it
was
like
long
stockings
only
it
was
in
one
piece
and
evidently
meant
to
fasten
round
the
waist
there
also
a
pair
of
sandals
and
a
really
sweet
cap
deah
sally
explained
is
it
a
fancy
dress
for
a
little
girl
i
asked
puzzled
for
a
little
girl
about
your
size
why
you
funny
child
it
your
dress
i
had
to
get
it
and
all
the
other
things
ready
made
for
there
was
time
for
anything
more
than
having
them
altered
to
your
measurement
if
they
were
to
be
ready
for
your
birthday
oh
sally
are
they
for
me
well
they
for
nobody
else
it
birthday
of
course
i
told
her
she
was
an
angel
and
so
she
was
quite
an
exceptional
kind
of
an
angel
and
i
kissed
her
and
was
saying
a
great
many
things
when
she
stopped
me
so
glad
you
like
them
deah
but
now
we
must
be
moving
if
we
to
have
our
bath
this
morning
louise
leave
katherine
but
we
have
one
of
the
other
maids
come
with
our
things
it
getting
late
i
felt
frightfully
it
late
is
it
said
i
hopefully
looking
at
my
watch
perhaps
it
too
late
to
go
this
morning
after
all
not
a
bit
of
it
said
sally
come
along
i
not
sure
but
that
i
better
stop
in
if
parker
thinks
would
want
me
to
i
floundered
on
she
wo
mind
not
much
anyway
if
we
do
take
you
to
the
casino
without
her
sally
tried
to
reassure
me
but
her
eyes
had
begun
to
twinkle
do
you
think
she
might
there
are
a
lot
of
letters
i
ought
now
child
out
with
it
do
you
like
the
bathing
dress
oh
i
it
immensely
i
stammered
it
like
a
a
picture
but
i
ca
see
myself
wearing
it
that
is
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
anyone
else
seeing
me
wear
it
sally
went
off
into
a
fit
of
musical
southern
laughter
you
poor
baby
i
forgot
the
shock
it
might
be
to
you
if
you
accustomed
only
to
english
bathing
clothes
they
certainly
are
the
have
you
never
been
to
trouville
or
ostend
i
shook
my
head
sad
at
having
to
seem
ungrateful
but
how
could
i
help
it
well
they
have
this
kind
there
and
so
they
do
here
everybody
has
it
my
prettiest
one
is
much
like
yours
only
it
katherine
is
cornflower
blue
this
year
and
she
got
a
black
one
and
a
lilac
one
when
you
see
all
the
others
prancing
about
in
the
same
sort
of
things
you
wo
feel
a
bit
funny
i
was
far
from
sure
that
i
should
attain
to
such
a
peaceful
state
of
mind
as
not
to
feel
funny
but
sally
had
called
me
a
baby
and
i
had
to
redeem
myself
from
that
aspersion
at
any
price
so
i
tried
to
compose
my
countenance
over
a
beating
heart
and
think
about
other
things
on
the
way
to
the
beach
as
you
do
if
you
are
going
to
the
dentist
potter
went
with
us
though
i
supposed
that
when
we
came
to
the
end
he
would
bid
us
and
trot
off
to
the
place
where
the
men
bathed
wherever
that
might
be
our
things
had
been
taken
on
ahead
by
a
servant
or
two
and
we
walked
as
the
day
was
perfect
and
i
was
thankful
to
get
a
little
exercise
we
met
a
great
many
people
whom
sally
and
potter
knew
and
just
as
potter
had
said
here
we
are
at
bailey
beach
that
handsome
pitchley
and
her
stepdaughter
with
doremus
came
up
they
called
to
us
so
we
stopped
to
speak
and
i
was
pleased
because
i
been
wanting
to
know
them
we
were
introduced
and
i
was
wondering
what
ess
kay
would
do
if
she
could
see
us
chatting
with
the
pitchleys
in
sight
of
all
newport
when
a
little
thin
man
looking
perfectly
furious
with
a
striped
bathing
suit
rolled
up
under
his
arm
came
hopping
along
towards
us
as
if
he
were
a
cricket
ball
that
somebody
had
batted
off
the
beach
his
panama
hat
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
his
single
eyeglass
on
its
chain
was
flying
out
behind
him
in
the
breeze
and
my
first
thought
was
how
comical
he
looked
my
second
as
he
came
nearer
was
something
quite
different
why
mohunsleigh
i
cried
he
stopped
hopping
so
abruptly
that
he
stumbled
and
nearly
fell
down
hullo
betty
he
growled
hauling
off
his
hat
as
if
he
hated
the
bother
of
doing
it
where
did
you
spring
from
home
where
on
earth
did
you
spring
from
i
echoed
they
sprung
me
off
their
beastly
beach
said
he
glaring
and
sticking
in
his
eyeglass
then
he
almost
waved
his
hideous
little
bathing
suit
at
me
would
let
me
bathe
the
bounders
would
let
you
bathe
no
said
ca
get
in
here
beach
is
for
millionaires
i
blest
if
i
do
shake
the
sand
off
my
feet
as
soon
as
i
can
pack
up
and
get
out
no
no
do
do
that
i
begged
there
some
mistake
perhaps
no
there
is
said
he
i
not
a
millionaire
but
i
did
think
i
looked
as
if
i
could
afford
a
bathe
sally
dear
do
let
me
introduce
my
cousin
lord
mohunsleigh
i
said
in
a
great
hurry
potter
opened
his
eyes
at
the
thin
little
man
and
and
miss
pitchley
looked
at
him
with
interest
do
introduce
us
all
laughed
pitchley
and
then
we
can
sympathise
with
lord
lord
oh
but
i
can
learn
to
pronounce
him
i
introduced
him
to
the
mother
and
stepdaughter
then
though
i
thought
of
its
being
necessary
and
explained
that
my
cousin
though
spelled
very
elaborately
was
pronounced
moonslee
he
had
evidently
abandoned
all
intention
of
immediate
flight
now
and
his
rage
was
visibly
cooling
he
was
looking
at
pitchley
with
quite
as
much
interest
as
she
showed
in
him
and
with
even
more
at
the
girl
although
he
talked
to
potter
parker
and
answered
his
questions
quite
civilly
he
explained
that
he
had
actually
been
ordered
away
from
the
beach
bathing
suit
and
all
by
some
impertinent
ass
of
an
official
potter
was
hospitably
distressed
but
pitchley
was
moved
to
laughter
ha
ha
wo
the
man
be
sick
when
he
sees
you
coming
back
with
us
and
hears
us
call
you
lord
mohunsleigh
for
if
you
point
him
out
in
time
that
what
i
call
you
right
under
his
nose
you
see
this
is
a
private
beach
we
all
subscribe
for
our
bath
houses
but
you
be
our
guest
of
course
and
i
put
pitchley
box
at
your
service
he
gone
off
fishing
for
a
few
days
only
to
think
of
the
earl
of
mohunsleigh
being
turned
back
delicious
ca
say
i
thought
of
it
that
way
till
now
said
mohunsleigh
pulling
his
wiry
moustache
and
condescending
to
grin
slightly
at
last
but
it
true
i
a
millionaire
you
know
you
an
earl
you
ca
say
you
not
for
i
read
in
only
the
other
day
that
the
earl
of
mohunsleigh
had
sailed
for
america
though
it
could
be
ascertained
on
what
ship
did
know
there
was
any
particular
reason
why
it
should
be
ascertained
said
mohunsleigh
i
run
over
to
visit
a
chap
in
california
dashed
nice
chap
too
but
thought
i
have
a
shot
at
new
york
first
and
blest
if
i
could
stand
it
never
could
stand
being
grilled
since
a
sunstroke
i
got
when
i
was
serving
in
india
dear
me
who
and
what
does
a
lord
serve
broke
in
miss
pitchley
which
surprised
mohunsleigh
and
me
both
so
much
that
he
stared
and
i
blushed
but
she
did
though
no
girl
under
vic
age
at
least
would
think
of
cutting
in
like
that
with
a
stranger
at
home
mohunsleigh
was
delighted
to
be
spoken
to
by
her
though
one
could
see
his
eyes
brightened
up
and
he
smiled
looking
straight
at
her
as
if
she
were
a
new
and
absolutely
desirable
kind
of
rifle
i
say
rifle
because
mohunsleigh
is
a
great
shot
and
would
rather
spend
his
money
what
he
has
of
it
on
a
new
invention
by
way
of
a
gun
than
anything
else
used
to
be
in
the
army
i
chucked
it
now
he
explained
affably
beginning
to
look
quite
nice
for
really
though
small
and
wiry
with
hair
and
moustache
and
eyes
mohunsleigh
is
an
ugly
man
when
you
come
to
notice
his
nice
sharp
features
he
only
a
distant
cousin
of
mine
and
so
old
he
nearly
forty
that
in
the
first
years
of
our
acquaintance
he
made
himself
agreeable
by
teaching
me
to
ride
on
his
foot
but
i
always
liked
him
whenever
i
remembered
his
existence
naturally
though
this
has
been
often
as
one
of
his
many
eccentricities
is
to
be
continually
prowling
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
anywhere
where
there
may
be
animals
to
shoot
what
kind
he
does
seem
to
care
if
they
are
only
large
enough
once
he
was
fond
of
tigers
but
the
last
thing
he
had
a
fad
for
was
polar
bears
and
he
sent
mother
a
skin
which
makes
the
oak
room
smell
strongly
of
camphor
i
hope
anyhow
you
going
to
pay
a
good
long
visit
to
newport
said
pitchley
i
meant
to
go
back
morning
replied
mohunsleigh
but
perhaps
i
might
stop
on
a
bit
longer
we
give
you
some
fun
volunteered
miss
pitchley
looking
frightfully
pretty
will
you
said
mohunsleigh
jolly
nice
of
you
i
must
think
about
it
then
he
deigned
to
remember
that
i
was
his
little
cousin
asked
when
i
arrived
on
this
side
the
water
and
a
few
other
things
but
he
looked
more
at
miss
pitchley
than
at
me
i
suppose
it
is
difficult
to
be
much
excited
about
a
person
who
has
taken
riding
lessons
on
your
foot
potter
asked
mohunsleigh
where
he
was
staying
and
when
he
heard
it
was
at
an
hotel
he
said
his
sister
would
allow
that
to
go
on
lord
mohunsleigh
would
have
to
come
to
the
moorings
that
was
settled
and
his
man
must
be
told
to
pack
up
his
things
directly
might
word
be
sent
by
messenger
at
once
have
brought
a
man
thanks
awfully
shed
that
habit
long
ago
said
my
cousin
i
got
precious
little
luggage
too
picked
this
thing
up
in
a
shop
as
i
came
along
and
they
charged
me
the
deuce
of
a
lot
for
it
you
awfully
good
you
know
and
all
that
to
offer
to
put
me
up
but
i
only
came
prepared
to
spend
a
night
or
two
then
potter
insisted
and
blew
all
mohunsleigh
objections
away
one
by
one
as
if
they
had
been
threads
of
cobweb
still
my
cousin
give
a
definite
answer
perhaps
not
understanding
american
hospitality
or
perhaps
having
other
ideas
which
he
preferred
at
all
events
we
went
to
the
bathing
machines
which
were
bathing
machines
at
all
but
dear
little
houses
without
anything
being
decided
the
only
invitation
which
mohunsleigh
had
really
accepted
was
pitchley
for
her
husband
bathing
box
she
kept
her
word
and
called
him
lord
mohunsleigh
in
quite
a
high
voice
just
as
we
passed
the
man
who
had
refused
to
let
him
go
onto
the
beach
before
but
the
man
did
seem
impressed
in
the
least
i
think
he
did
even
recognise
mohunsleigh
as
the
same
person
or
if
he
did
he
pretended
very
cleverly
not
to
i
had
forgotten
the
horror
of
the
bathing
dress
in
my
surprise
at
meeting
mohunsleigh
but
it
fell
over
me
again
like
a
cloud
as
soon
as
i
was
shut
up
in
the
bathing
box
with
those
wisps
of
green
silk
i
would
have
the
maid
help
me
and
wrestled
with
the
ordeal
alone
it
took
me
some
time
but
when
everything
was
on
there
were
only
four
things
counting
the
cap
and
smart
little
sandals
i
could
say
to
myself
that
the
effect
was
attractive
it
was
and
i
did
approve
of
myself
in
the
quaint
which
was
more
like
a
fetching
silk
toque
with
an
alsatian
bow
in
front
than
a
mere
cap
but
the
awful
moment
came
when
i
was
ready
with
my
hand
on
the
door
i
sure
joan
of
arc
must
have
felt
like
that
when
she
had
let
her
hair
down
and
put
on
that
graceful
white
dress
of
hers
one
sees
in
the
pictures
to
be
burned
she
may
have
been
dimly
aware
that
she
was
looking
quite
her
best
as
i
was
but
even
that
could
have
buoyed
her
up
much
at
the
moment
and
it
did
me
as
i
stood
hesitating
somebody
knocked
i
peeped
out
and
it
was
sally
quiet
unassuming
little
sally
with
her
airs
looking
like
one
of
stan
gaiety
girl
photographs
in
a
short
dress
of
bright
poppy
colour
with
silk
legs
as
shiny
as
an
archdeacon
only
with
quite
a
different
effect
come
on
my
green
undine
said
she
and
i
came
because
she
pulled
me
so
suddenly
that
otherwise
i
should
have
fallen
flat
on
my
nose
having
seen
her
dressed
so
much
in
my
style
it
was
quite
as
bad
as
before
and
when
i
was
out
of
my
box
like
one
of
those
little
barometer
women
that
tell
fair
weather
there
was
pitchley
in
crimson
and
carolyn
pitchley
in
white
and
lots
of
pretty
women
all
with
the
same
lovely
stockings
there
had
been
any
standing
about
when
we
arrived
because
we
were
early
not
having
gone
to
the
casino
first
as
the
others
had
and
it
was
a
relief
to
find
them
or
it
was
until
i
had
a
great
shock
instead
of
the
men
being
away
at
a
separate
beach
of
their
own
they
were
put
with
us
and
kept
popping
out
of
boxes
every
minute
and
running
up
to
talk
to
the
girls
they
knew
just
as
calmly
as
if
they
were
in
evening
dress
my
eyes
almost
came
out
of
my
head
for
an
instant
then
i
just
swallowed
hard
and
leaped
over
about
five
centuries
of
prejudice
as
if
i
were
jumping
across
a
tiny
beck
everything
a
matter
of
custom
said
i
to
myself
and
in
another
minute
i
was
racing
gaily
down
to
the
water
hand
in
hand
with
sally
as
if
we
had
been
little
girls
with
sand
pails
and
shovels
i
expected
to
feel
as
if
i
had
plunged
into
a
bath
of
iced
water
when
i
got
out
among
the
creamy
breakers
but
judging
from
the
sensation
americans
have
had
their
part
of
the
atlantic
beautifully
warmed
from
underneath
with
some
patent
heating
apparatus
it
would
be
just
like
them
the
sandy
beach
is
so
level
you
can
patter
out
ever
so
far
until
you
finally
have
to
bob
up
and
down
for
the
rolling
waves
as
if
they
were
royalties
and
so
they
are
for
the
kingdom
of
mer
i
can
swim
a
little
and
potter
took
me
beyond
the
breakers
it
was
great
fun
under
that
arch
of
turquoise
sky
with
the
sun
dancing
on
the
clear
green
water
as
if
the
millionaires
of
newport
had
been
sprinkling
gold
pieces
but
the
best
of
all
was
the
floating
platform
about
a
hundred
yards
from
the
beach
where
we
sat
and
let
the
emeralds
and
pearls
that
the
princesses
of
mer
threw
spray
over
us
at
home
when
you
are
at
the
sea
your
governess
or
some
other
person
who
thinks
enjoyment
ought
to
be
measured
off
by
rule
sits
on
the
shore
looking
at
her
watch
and
when
you
have
been
in
exactly
twenty
minutes
she
tells
you
to
come
out
directly
or
you
will
catch
a
chill
i
always
wondered
what
it
would
do
to
you
if
you
stopped
in
for
minutes
though
i
never
had
the
chance
to
try
but
in
america
all
that
is
quite
different
as
different
as
the
very
way
they
say
seaside
with
their
accent
on
the
first
instead
of
the
last
syllable
nobody
thinks
about
watches
you
just
bathe
and
bathe
as
long
as
you
feel
like
it
when
you
are
tired
of
it
you
come
out
then
you
bake
yourself
in
the
sand
for
a
little
while
if
you
like
and
run
back
to
begin
over
again
it
is
heavenly
no
other
adjective
half
expresses
it
when
we
did
really
make
up
our
minds
to
stop
out
for
good
and
had
dressed
ourselves
feeling
like
goddesses
just
born
of
the
foam
or
gods
as
the
case
might
be
we
all
met
our
party
the
pitchleys
and
my
cousin
to
arrange
about
what
mohunsleigh
would
do
it
seemed
that
pitchley
had
invited
him
to
lunch
and
as
she
had
been
so
kind
about
the
bathhouse
he
explained
to
potter
he
thought
that
he
could
very
well
refuse
about
stopping
on
he
would
decide
later
but
he
consented
to
drive
with
us
in
the
afternoon
in
a
motor
car
of
potter
that
holds
six
by
that
time
he
would
have
had
time
to
send
a
wire
to
a
friend
of
his
in
new
york
and
to
make
up
his
mind
what
he
had
better
do
about
going
back
when
we
got
home
we
found
ess
kay
much
better
and
up
she
was
inclined
at
first
to
be
cross
with
sally
and
potter
for
taking
me
to
the
beach
but
when
she
heard
about
mohunsleigh
she
forgot
to
be
vexed
and
seemed
almost
excited
about
him
i
ca
think
why
she
asked
lots
of
questions
very
quickly
one
after
the
other
brightening
up
when
potter
told
how
he
had
invited
mohunsleigh
to
come
to
the
moorings
but
looking
quite
strained
and
wild
at
the
news
about
his
lunching
with
the
pitchleys
you
to
have
let
him
go
potter
she
said
potter
shrugged
his
shoulders
those
square
american
shoulders
of
his
strange
as
it
may
seem
to
you
he
wanted
to
that
settled
it
i
monkey
with
the
gunpowder
ess
kay
lips
went
down
at
the
corners
and
her
eyes
flashed
how
easy
it
is
to
see
that
woman
game
said
she
cora
pitchley
knows
that
van
der
windt
and
the
committee
will
be
only
too
anxious
for
us
to
go
to
the
pink
ball
and
she
thinks
she
sees
a
way
of
getting
there
too
after
all
mark
my
words
she
got
her
earl
it
go
hard
with
her
if
she
does
to
him
betty
ca
you
do
something
he
your
cousin
you
a
right
to
him
i
do
know
that
i
want
him
particularly
i
confessed
mohunsleigh
a
dear
queer
old
thing
and
i
fond
of
him
but
we
have
seen
much
of
him
at
home
for
years
and
i
know
he
ca
be
bothered
with
me
anyhow
he
certainly
ought
to
be
here
said
ess
kay
anxiously
it
will
be
perfectly
loathsome
if
we
have
to
sit
still
and
see
the
pitchley
gobble
him
up
poor
mohunsleigh
i
exclaimed
why
what
will
they
with
him
and
for
a
lurid
instant
i
beheld
miss
pitchley
and
carolyn
as
beautiful
ogresses
with
their
lips
red
too
red
they
go
to
the
pink
ball
with
him
and
by
him
they
without
him
that
what
they
said
ess
kay
as
if
she
saw
my
cousin
whitening
bones
picked
clean
by
the
pitchley
family
and
we
shall
have
to
be
intimate
with
them
the
whole
time
he
stays
oh
you
need
feel
bound
to
for
my
sake
it
is
as
though
mohunsleigh
i
began
but
ess
kay
snapped
my
poor
sentence
in
two
as
if
it
had
been
cotton
on
a
reel
i
have
to
think
for
all
of
us
said
she
cora
pitchley
is
a
climber
we
changed
our
dresses
sally
says
one
must
be
forever
changing
dress
at
newport
lunched
and
then
at
the
door
appeared
a
gorgeous
white
motor
car
lined
with
scarlet
which
i
had
never
seen
before
as
we
all
had
on
white
from
head
to
foot
we
matched
it
beautifully
and
feeling
that
we
looked
nice
enough
even
to
grace
an
accident
if
it
come
we
started
to
pick
up
carolyn
pitchley
and
my
cousin
ess
kay
did
go
for
she
was
quite
herself
yet
and
besides
she
perhaps
thought
that
in
the
circumstances
mohunsleigh
ought
to
be
brought
to
call
before
she
met
him
informally
i
do
know
that
any
of
us
were
as
sorry
as
we
ought
to
have
been
not
to
have
her
the
pitchleys
house
which
is
called
the
château
de
plaisance
is
on
a
much
grander
scale
than
the
moorings
it
thinks
it
is
an
old
french
château
and
tries
to
convey
the
same
impression
to
beholders
as
do
several
others
of
more
or
less
the
same
sort
but
it
a
hopeless
effort
the
poor
dears
might
as
well
give
up
and
resign
themselves
once
for
all
to
being
a
blot
on
the
exquisite
blue
and
gold
landscape
though
perhaps
if
they
can
hold
out
for
two
or
three
hundred
years
they
may
do
better
the
farther
we
went
along
a
glorious
road
called
the
cliff
drive
and
the
more
charming
colonial
houses
and
delightful
cottages
i
saw
the
more
i
felt
that
the
regular
palaces
were
mistakes
with
newport
for
a
setting
and
the
sea
for
a
background
i
am
glad
that
i
did
live
at
the
time
when
all
the
real
castles
of
the
world
were
young
and
awkward
perhaps
they
looked
just
as
crude
as
these
at
first
though
it
hard
to
imagine
it
when
we
went
back
the
first
thing
that
ess
kay
asked
was
well
what
about
lord
mohunsleigh
he
made
up
his
mind
to
stop
and
send
for
his
things
said
i
you
gave
him
my
note
he
coming
to
us
i
gave
him
the
note
and
he
coming
round
presently
to
thank
you
for
being
so
kind
but
he
feels
he
had
better
stay
with
the
pitchleys
you
see
it
like
this
they
happen
to
be
sending
a
servant
to
new
york
to
do
some
commissions
for
pitchley
so
the
man
will
go
to
mohunsleigh
hotel
too
and
as
they
doing
so
much
for
him
and
pitchley
and
her
husband
know
some
friends
of
his
at
home
he
thinks
but
he
tell
you
all
about
it
himself
i
told
you
so
said
ess
kay
x
about
a
violet
tea
and
a
millionaire
while
we
were
motoring
ess
kay
had
been
terribly
busy
with
her
secretary
getting
invitations
ready
for
a
violet
tea
she
was
giving
the
tea
she
explained
to
introduce
me
to
newport
society
and
she
was
having
a
violet
one
because
it
was
not
the
right
time
of
year
for
violets
i
meekly
suggested
that
as
a
reason
for
giving
some
other
kind
of
tea
but
she
said
not
at
all
she
wished
to
have
that
kind
because
violets
were
hard
to
get
though
not
impossible
i
would
see
when
the
time
came
that
she
could
get
them
and
i
should
also
see
if
it
were
indeed
true
that
i
did
not
know
what
a
violet
tea
was
she
wanted
it
to
be
a
surprise
for
me
she
thought
i
would
like
it
i
had
long
to
wait
before
learning
the
true
inwardness
of
a
violet
tea
for
ess
kay
was
determined
to
get
me
out
as
soon
as
possible
and
it
seems
that
in
america
the
time
to
bring
a
girl
out
is
at
a
tea
at
least
that
is
one
way
and
as
ess
kay
was
even
then
planning
to
give
something
very
big
just
before
the
much
talked
about
pink
ball
so
as
to
take
the
shine
off
that
grand
affair
she
wished
to
get
the
teacups
washed
up
before
she
sent
out
the
next
invitations
i
sure
mother
would
take
as
much
trouble
for
a
house
party
to
meet
the
king
and
queen
as
ess
kay
did
for
that
violet
tea
and
i
dare
think
even
now
though
it
happened
weeks
ago
of
the
money
she
must
have
spent
for
one
thing
she
and
sally
and
i
had
to
have
violet
dresses
she
would
buy
mine
i
do
see
how
i
should
have
done
it
if
she
had
especially
as
vic
wrote
just
then
that
mother
felt
poorer
than
ever
and
that
man
had
yet
proposed
and
it
was
beautiful
pale
violet
silk
muslin
trimmed
with
violets
and
their
leaves
then
violet
and
silver
livery
was
ordered
in
a
great
hurry
for
the
four
footmen
to
be
worn
on
one
afternoon
and
no
more
but
these
things
were
mere
sketchy
details
compared
to
other
preparations
one
room
where
tea
was
to
be
served
was
entirely
draped
with
violet
silk
from
the
palest
to
the
darkest
shades
and
for
the
smaller
of
the
two
the
one
where
ess
kay
would
stand
to
receive
her
guests
wire
frames
were
made
from
measurements
to
fit
and
cover
all
four
walls
i
could
imagine
what
these
frames
were
for
at
first
but
when
their
hour
came
they
were
padded
with
moss
and
covered
with
fresh
violets
the
curtains
were
taken
down
from
the
windows
and
a
network
of
violets
was
hung
up
in
their
place
with
an
effect
of
great
loveliness
when
the
light
streamed
through
the
screen
of
flowers
and
even
this
was
not
all
for
a
soft
thick
mat
of
grass
and
moss
was
spread
over
the
polished
floor
with
a
sprinkling
of
violets
all
the
furniture
was
taken
away
and
instead
along
the
walls
were
placed
banks
of
artificial
moss
and
violets
no
doubt
these
would
have
been
real
too
but
when
crushed
they
would
have
stained
the
dresses
of
those
that
sat
upon
them
altogether
the
room
was
turned
into
a
woodsy
bower
of
violets
and
i
was
given
a
great
bunch
of
the
dear
flowers
to
carry
there
had
been
only
a
week
in
which
to
prepare
these
sensational
effects
but
everything
was
finished
in
time
and
without
flurry
already
i
knew
a
great
many
of
ess
kay
friends
and
on
the
day
of
the
tea
it
seemed
that
each
person
whose
acquaintance
i
had
made
had
remembered
me
with
a
cartwheel
of
violets
all
my
flowers
were
placed
in
vases
on
tables
in
the
big
adjoining
the
bower
of
violets
and
as
a
card
was
attached
to
each
bunch
pinned
on
the
masses
of
violet
satin
ribbon
which
trailed
from
it
each
giver
could
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
how
his
gift
compared
with
his
neighbour
it
was
a
wonderful
display
a
violet
show
and
as
ess
kay
had
said
it
was
not
the
right
time
of
the
year
for
violets
we
stood
on
our
feet
for
hours
smiled
yards
of
smiles
and
said
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
so
many
times
that
i
began
to
feel
like
a
phonograph
doll
which
i
saw
in
my
first
new
york
shop
only
when
i
ran
down
nobody
wound
me
up
and
i
had
to
go
on
by
myself
as
best
i
could
which
was
fatiguing
and
made
the
machinery
squeak
but
everybody
said
it
was
a
huge
success
the
new
york
papers
had
each
more
than
a
column
about
the
function
as
they
called
it
and
ess
kay
was
piously
happy
i
had
thought
we
were
very
gay
before
but
after
the
violet
tea
from
getting
up
to
going
to
bed
we
never
had
a
moment
that
had
its
own
appointed
place
in
the
procession
of
hours
like
a
bead
in
a
long
rosary
after
breakfast
we
went
to
the
casino
to
play
tennis
listen
to
the
concert
or
pretend
to
and
to
gabble
there
we
would
meet
everybody
we
knew
and
it
was
odd
to
see
the
calm
but
slightly
conscious
air
of
superiority
with
which
the
everybodies
going
in
or
out
passed
the
poor
nobodies
assembled
to
watch
the
casino
entrance
just
as
the
middle
and
lower
class
people
stand
till
they
are
ready
to
drop
only
to
see
the
queen
drive
into
the
park
or
leave
buckingham
palace
dreadfully
bored
to
open
a
bridge
so
these
americans
jostle
each
other
to
see
their
millionaires
and
especially
millionaires
going
to
enjoy
themselves
fancy
if
londoners
reduced
themselves
to
a
state
of
collapse
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
beit
take
off
his
hat
to
wertheimer
but
the
millionaires
in
america
seem
to
be
like
our
aristocracy
only
more
important
for
the
non
millionaires
take
a
great
deal
more
trouble
to
stare
at
them
than
the
common
people
do
at
us
after
the
casino
there
was
always
the
beach
and
the
most
delightful
things
happened
at
the
beach
it
was
never
twice
the
same
then
we
would
lunch
with
some
one
or
some
one
would
lunch
with
us
at
the
moorings
afterwards
there
would
be
a
drive
calls
to
make
perhaps
two
or
three
wonderful
at
homes
or
concerts
with
great
singers
and
entertainers
from
new
york
twenty
minutes
rest
and
then
a
scramble
to
dress
for
dinner
with
a
dinner
dance
to
follow
or
amateur
theatricals
of
course
as
i
have
been
presented
yet
and
do
know
anything
about
what
the
season
is
like
in
town
except
what
vic
has
told
me
i
ca
judge
of
the
differences
at
first
hand
but
then
vic
has
told
me
a
lot
and
i
have
heard
stan
and
loveland
talk
besides
one
seems
to
know
one
own
country
and
country
people
by
instinct
without
having
actually
to
see
what
they
do
and
i
sure
that
even
in
the
smartest
set
at
home
they
do
dream
of
bothering
their
heads
to
think
of
such
original
entertainments
as
in
america
in
england
there
are
just
two
or
three
kinds
of
parties
you
give
a
crush
which
is
grand
if
you
have
a
big
house
or
you
ask
a
few
bright
particular
ones
and
enjoy
yourself
or
in
the
country
you
have
a
house
party
and
pick
out
the
men
because
they
can
shoot
and
the
women
because
they
are
pretty
or
else
if
it
winter
you
hunt
and
you
have
theatricals
but
the
americans
at
newport
turn
up
their
noses
at
that
slow
kind
of
thing
they
lie
awake
nights
i
sure
they
must
to
think
of
something
so
original
that
nobody
else
can
ever
have
had
anything
the
least
like
it
before
it
is
better
too
to
have
it
very
sensational
and
startling
if
you
are
invited
to
a
party
you
never
know
a
bit
what
it
will
be
like
whether
you
will
dance
in
a
barn
and
eat
your
supper
on
horseback
out
of
decorated
mangers
whether
there
will
be
captive
balloons
at
a
garden
party
whether
a
noah
ark
will
have
been
rigged
up
on
a
miniature
lake
or
whether
you
will
have
a
pair
of
skates
provided
for
you
and
find
yourself
cutting
figures
on
the
ice
in
a
gorgeously
illuminated
with
the
thermometer
up
to
goodness
knows
how
many
degrees
outside
of
course
in
a
place
where
everybody
gets
nervous
prostration
trying
to
outdo
everybody
else
in
originality
and
extravagance
it
would
be
like
ess
kay
to
let
herself
fall
behind
she
simply
made
up
her
mind
that
her
big
entertainment
should
be
affair
of
the
season
before
she
decided
what
form
it
should
take
she
thought
instead
of
sleeping
for
several
nights
and
began
to
wear
the
expression
on
her
face
which
i
have
in
motor
cars
when
i
think
we
are
going
to
telescope
with
something
twice
our
size
and
am
trying
to
prepare
for
eternity
with
a
pleasant
smile
on
my
lips
she
ate
scarcely
anything
telephoned
a
good
deal
and
took
phenacetin
in
hot
milk
then
suddenly
it
came
to
her
i
mean
the
idea
we
were
at
lunch
when
she
thought
of
it
and
luckily
there
were
no
visitors
except
pitchley
and
carolyn
mohunsleigh
and
tom
doremus
it
was
bad
enough
even
with
them
for
she
half
sprang
up
then
sat
down
again
first
going
red
then
going
pale
and
we
all
thought
she
was
getting
ready
to
faint
but
as
soon
as
she
could
speak
she
said
when
we
shrieked
at
her
it
nothing
nothing
i
just
thought
of
something
that
all
afterwards
when
she
and
sally
and
potter
and
i
were
alone
together
she
told
us
that
at
last
she
had
got
the
right
inspiration
for
her
big
entertainment
it
was
two
days
after
the
violet
tea
so
it
was
quite
time
she
should
get
it
she
said
and
she
had
been
dreadfully
worried
because
the
invitations
ought
to
go
out
almost
at
once
the
famous
pink
ball
at
the
casino
was
for
the
and
she
wanted
to
have
her
party
the
night
before
so
that
everybody
would
be
worn
out
and
the
ball
would
fall
flat
but
we
got
our
cards
all
right
now
said
potter
why
do
you
want
to
queer
the
show
i
intend
to
show
van
der
windt
what
i
can
she
answered
suppose
a
lot
of
the
people
you
want
refuse
you
so
that
they
can
be
fresh
for
the
ball
sally
suggested
they
wo
said
ess
kay
when
they
have
seen
what
i
shall
say
on
the
invitations
then
she
got
up
went
to
her
desk
took
out
some
engraved
cards
which
she
had
ready
all
but
filling
in
the
date
and
wrote
something
in
one
corner
what
do
you
think
of
that
she
asked
sally
sally
took
the
card
looked
at
it
for
a
minute
laughed
and
passed
it
on
to
me
while
potter
came
and
stared
over
my
shoulder
she
had
written
across
the
card
fancy
dress
with
masks
a
visit
to
the
maze
and
aladdin
cave
do
you
think
that
will
bring
them
she
enquired
with
a
triumphant
and
mysterious
air
i
think
it
said
sally
you
know
your
business
old
girl
remarked
potter
they
want
to
know
what
it
means
and
they
be
bound
to
come
and
find
out
what
your
idea
anyway
i
tell
you
another
time
said
ess
kay
i
should
like
it
to
be
a
surprise
for
betty
just
as
it
will
be
for
people
outside
enjoy
it
more
i
did
tease
to
know
the
secret
though
i
was
really
curious
especially
about
aladdin
cave
which
seemed
to
promise
something
gorgeous
the
mystery
was
religiously
kept
but
there
was
plenty
of
excitement
in
sending
out
the
invitations
there
were
endless
discussions
between
ess
kay
and
potter
and
though
she
seemed
so
angry
with
van
der
windt
and
several
other
members
of
the
ball
committee
for
trying
to
make
a
stand
against
her
she
was
perfectly
ruthless
about
the
names
she
would
scratch
off
the
lists
her
secretary
was
continually
making
out
and
revising
for
her
i
heard
her
say
that
she
would
have
dreamed
of
asking
the
pitchleys
if
they
had
got
hold
of
mohunsleigh
and
that
cora
pitchley
whatever
else
she
might
be
was
the
cleverest
woman
in
newport
to
have
scooped
in
all
the
honours
though
to
this
day
i
ca
see
exactly
what
she
meant
for
she
never
would
explain
anyhow
whatever
the
superlatively
clever
thing
was
that
pitchley
had
done
there
was
no
longer
a
question
of
her
being
kept
out
from
the
pink
ball
or
anything
else
people
were
charming
to
her
and
we
met
van
der
windt
herself
at
the
chateau
at
a
luncheon
party
with
a
vaudeville
entertainment
afterwards
and
also
at
a
dinner
van
der
windt
seemed
to
like
my
cousin
mohunsleigh
very
much
too
and
gave
a
moonlight
motor
car
picnic
especially
for
him
with
only
a
few
people
asked
besides
ourselves
and
the
pitchleys
and
tom
doremus
mohunsleigh
had
not
expected
to
stay
more
than
a
few
days
but
when
he
found
that
the
friend
he
wanted
to
visit
in
california
was
detained
in
new
york
on
business
and
pitchley
and
everybody
urged
him
very
much
to
stop
he
decided
that
he
would
i
did
suppose
that
mohunsleigh
would
care
for
frivolities
after
all
the
years
he
has
spent
tramping
about
in
strange
countries
killing
things
but
he
appeared
to
be
perfectly
happy
and
nothing
bored
him
so
long
as
the
pitchleys
were
there
when
ess
kay
was
making
out
the
list
of
invitations
for
the
great
blow
out
as
potter
called
it
mohunsleigh
happened
to
stroll
over
to
the
moorings
alone
he
came
to
tell
us
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
stay
and
why
you
see
he
exclaimed
i
had
an
invitation
for
any
special
time
from
harborough
it
was
a
sort
of
standing
thing
given
when
we
met
in
damascus
last
winter
i
was
to
come
when
i
could
and
be
always
welcome
that
sort
of
thing
do
you
know
i
cabled
the
day
i
sailed
and
did
get
any
answer
but
i
had
been
in
new
york
two
hours
when
i
blessed
if
the
beggar
did
walk
in
on
me
at
the
waldorf
jolly
glad
to
see
me
and
all
that
but
had
to
hang
on
in
new
york
for
a
bit
on
some
business
or
other
now
he
thinks
he
ca
get
off
for
a
fortnight
or
so
and
as
what
he
got
on
is
my
sort
of
racket
i
might
as
well
be
here
as
anywhere
else
perhaps
a
little
better
what
harborough
is
your
friend
enquired
ess
kay
with
interest
the
new
san
francisco
millionaire
do
know
how
new
he
is
said
mohunsleigh
or
even
whether
he
a
millionaire
for
it
the
sort
of
thing
one
does
ask
a
chap
but
if
he
is
a
millionaire
he
can
spend
money
like
one
for
i
seen
him
do
it
a
deuce
of
a
good
fellow
he
is
do
know
a
better
anywhere
it
jameson
harborough
is
it
asked
sally
and
i
was
quite
surprised
to
hear
her
ask
the
question
for
she
never
seems
to
take
any
interest
in
a
man
just
because
he
is
a
millionaire
as
so
many
of
the
other
people
i
meet
do
yes
those
are
his
initials
said
mohunsleigh
looking
bored
then
it
the
millionaire
katherine
went
on
sally
quite
eagerly
do
you
think
as
he
said
to
be
such
an
interesting
original
sort
of
person
and
such
a
friend
of
lord
mohunsleigh
besides
that
it
would
be
nice
if
you
gave
lord
mohunsleigh
a
card
to
send
him
for
your
party
on
the
why
yes
that
a
very
good
idea
of
yours
sally
exclaimed
ess
kay
i
shall
be
delighted
i
give
you
the
card
now
lord
mohunsleigh
if
you
do
mind
lord
mohunsleigh
said
that
he
would
be
very
pleased
but
he
tell
at
all
whether
his
friend
went
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
had
an
idea
he
did
and
rather
fought
shy
of
society
shows
though
of
course
harborough
was
a
gentleman
and
all
that
anyhow
you
send
him
the
card
and
write
him
a
line
saying
we
should
like
to
meet
him
persisted
ess
kay
accordingly
mohunsleigh
slipped
the
card
in
its
crested
envelope
into
his
pocket
and
we
heard
nothing
more
of
it
for
a
while
then
when
i
at
least
had
forgotten
the
conversation
in
the
wild
rush
for
pleasure
in
which
we
lived
he
said
one
day
to
ess
kay
and
sally
that
his
friend
would
be
so
much
obliged
if
the
invitation
might
be
kept
open
harborough
could
be
sure
until
the
last
moment
whether
he
could
come
or
not
but
would
be
delighted
to
do
so
if
he
might
be
allowed
to
decide
at
the
last
moment
all
newport
was
soon
talking
about
ess
kay
mysterious
fancy
dress
party
which
was
exactly
a
ball
but
was
nobody
knew
what
people
wondered
about
the
maze
and
aladdin
cave
and
those
who
were
asked
were
sure
they
would
be
something
to
be
remembered
and
talked
of
through
coming
seasons
while
those
who
were
not
were
equally
certain
that
the
great
mysteries
would
turn
out
to
be
stupid
and
childish
the
pink
ball
which
had
been
the
one
absorbing
topic
of
conversation
till
ess
kay
invitations
appeared
became
a
matter
of
secondary
interest
and
ess
kay
and
pitchley
both
began
thus
early
to
be
avenged
potter
surprised
me
one
morning
with
the
design
of
a
fancy
dress
which
he
announced
that
he
been
inspired
in
the
night
to
sketch
for
my
benefit
according
to
him
i
was
to
represent
the
frost
sprite
in
glittering
white
garments
with
a
long
veil
like
a
trail
of
sparkling
mist
i
thought
it
rather
suggestive
of
a
christmas
card
but
ess
kay
was
so
charmed
with
the
idea
that
she
begged
me
to
have
it
potter
will
be
if
you
do
and
besides
it
will
cost
you
next
to
nothing
she
said
it
was
the
latter
consideration
rather
more
than
the
first
which
decided
me
to
give
my
gracious
consent
ess
kay
telegraphed
to
a
who
was
also
an
artist
he
came
made
a
few
practical
alterations
in
potter
design
and
arranged
costumes
for
ess
kay
and
sally
afterwards
when
my
bill
came
in
which
it
did
do
till
i
asked
for
it
it
certainly
was
ridiculously
small
a
mere
nothing
even
for
me
but
i
could
help
having
some
uncomfortable
suspicions
and
i
have
them
still
xi
about
a
great
affair
and
now
i
have
come
to
the
great
affair
it
is
the
day
after
and
i
have
been
scribbling
down
in
a
hurry
all
the
things
that
happened
to
me
in
newport
meanwhile
for
somehow
most
things
have
seemed
to
lead
up
to
that
i
knew
no
more
than
anybody
outside
about
the
mystery
of
the
maze
and
aladdin
cave
the
secret
was
wonderfully
kept
although
there
was
a
constant
undertone
of
excitement
running
through
the
house
for
days
beforehand
and
an
army
of
workmen
were
busy
in
the
grounds
as
everyone
calls
them
first
putting
up
a
gigantic
marquee
and
then
working
inside
it
one
man
told
ess
kay
that
he
had
been
offered
a
hundred
dollars
by
a
new
york
newspaper
to
tell
what
was
the
nature
of
his
work
at
the
moorings
but
either
the
bribe
was
enough
or
else
he
was
impeccable
all
under
the
house
runs
a
great
cellar
i
knew
this
from
the
first
because
one
broiling
hot
day
soon
after
i
came
sally
took
me
down
to
get
cool
after
i
had
dressed
for
somebody
at
home
and
looked
like
a
freshly
boiled
lobster
it
a
series
of
rooms
perfectly
ventilated
with
rough
walls
and
cemented
floors
one
of
the
rooms
is
of
enormous
size
and
there
are
stone
pillars
dotted
about
here
and
there
for
supports
there
is
one
other
that
is
rather
large
but
the
rest
are
small
one
is
used
as
if
it
were
an
ice
house
there
are
others
for
wine
and
there
are
some
storerooms
for
a
week
before
the
great
affair
men
were
working
down
there
all
day
and
towards
the
last
far
into
the
night
big
boxes
and
bales
were
lugged
down
stairs
and
did
come
up
again
not
a
hint
went
round
of
what
was
going
on
but
i
was
sure
that
aladdin
cave
was
in
mysterious
process
of
manufacture
there
seemed
quite
a
pressure
on
the
atmosphere
for
days
at
the
moorings
except
in
sally
woodburn
rooms
for
i
noticed
that
she
is
never
excited
by
social
events
they
seem
of
little
real
importance
to
her
i
suppose
compared
with
the
past
which
she
has
always
in
her
thoughts
when
i
was
with
her
i
felt
calmer
but
with
others
or
when
i
was
alone
which
seldom
happened
for
more
than
ten
minutes
at
a
stretch
i
was
as
much
excited
as
anybody
partly
it
may
have
been
the
effect
of
climate
for
the
air
in
america
certainly
does
make
you
feel
always
as
if
something
wonderful
was
going
to
happen
to
you
round
the
next
corner
and
partly
it
was
the
effect
of
potter
potter
was
most
disturbing
and
is
still
for
that
matter
he
has
the
air
of
feeling
that
he
and
he
alone
has
a
right
to
me
and
it
quite
a
lesson
in
tact
keeping
the
peace
between
him
and
other
men
who
feel
it
their
christian
duty
to
be
a
little
nice
to
a
young
foreigner
but
i
am
thinking
now
of
the
time
before
the
great
affair
it
really
was
a
strain
wondering
what
it
would
be
like
and
whether
it
would
be
a
grand
success
or
whether
it
would
fall
short
of
all
the
brilliant
expectations
when
the
mystery
should
be
revealed
at
last
the
night
came
the
invitations
were
for
ten
and
people
could
not
resist
the
temptation
to
come
soon
after
the
hour
and
begin
ess
kay
stood
in
the
early
english
that
the
style
it
furnished
in
or
she
believes
it
is
receiving
without
a
mask
and
dressed
to
represent
queen
margaret
of
navarre
from
whom
she
says
that
she
is
descended
she
had
another
dress
to
put
on
afterwards
so
that
none
of
the
guests
would
recognise
her
and
she
could
have
fun
with
the
rest
but
no
one
knew
about
that
except
sally
and
potter
and
me
we
others
did
appear
at
first
because
we
had
no
costumes
to
change
with
but
by
and
by
when
a
lot
of
people
had
arrived
we
mingled
with
them
as
soon
as
anyone
came
in
ess
kay
would
say
how
do
you
do
my
lord
of
leicester
or
my
noble
george
washington
or
whatever
the
person
might
be
trying
to
be
so
glad
to
see
you
you
must
go
and
have
a
look
at
the
maze
do
you
know
how
to
find
it
just
through
that
curtain
you
ca
miss
the
way
then
the
gorgeous
masker
would
cross
the
hall
and
disappear
behind
a
great
curtain
of
tapestry
that
covered
an
open
doorway
leading
to
the
garden
but
he
had
to
go
out
of
doors
a
canvas
covered
winding
passage
took
him
to
the
vast
marquee
which
was
of
course
the
maze
but
why
it
was
the
maze
and
what
happened
to
you
in
the
maze
after
you
had
got
in
i
did
know
any
more
than
the
outsiders
that
was
the
fun
of
it
for
me
of
course
and
it
really
was
fun
sally
had
only
taken
enough
pains
about
her
dress
to
save
annoying
ess
kay
she
was
a
white
carmelite
with
a
veil
over
her
face
instead
of
a
mask
but
potter
had
made
a
tremendous
fuss
about
himself
he
was
flame
which
he
said
was
appropriate
in
the
circumstances
as
he
had
got
so
used
to
playing
fire
to
my
frost
he
felt
quite
at
home
in
the
character
and
he
was
very
magnificent
he
had
designed
the
costume
himself
for
he
fancies
himself
at
that
sort
of
thing
and
my
white
sparkling
robes
and
his
scarlet
satin
and
carbuncle
embroidery
and
copper
and
gold
fringes
did
look
rather
effective
side
by
side
he
made
that
an
excuse
for
insisting
that
i
should
go
with
him
into
the
maze
although
a
tall
hamlet
and
a
henry
of
england
both
wanted
to
take
me
potter
whisked
me
away
from
them
somehow
and
we
passed
under
the
tapestry
curtains
while
one
of
the
two
hungarian
bands
ess
kay
had
hired
played
a
waltz
which
made
me
long
to
dance
this
way
to
the
maze
this
way
to
the
maze
a
man
dressed
like
a
beefeater
was
continually
saying
he
stood
just
outside
the
door
in
a
kind
of
canvas
vestibule
lined
with
greenery
so
that
it
looked
like
the
entrance
to
a
bower
the
passage
to
the
marquee
had
been
made
so
beautiful
that
i
help
crying
out
to
potter
with
admiration
not
an
inch
of
the
canvas
showed
for
we
walked
through
a
sort
of
tunnel
of
roses
all
lit
up
with
invisible
electric
lights
it
was
like
the
way
to
fairyland
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
mat
of
artificial
grass
like
they
have
for
stage
lawns
potter
said
i
thought
when
we
came
to
the
end
of
the
we
should
find
ourselves
in
a
big
open
space
in
the
marquee
but
when
the
tunnel
stopped
we
were
in
a
narrow
alley
between
tall
green
bushes
set
so
thickly
and
so
close
together
that
we
could
see
what
was
on
the
other
side
above
us
instead
of
the
canvas
roof
of
the
marquee
which
must
have
been
over
all
a
violet
mist
seemed
to
float
with
a
very
faint
soft
light
filtering
through
it
like
blue
moonlight
i
suppose
it
must
have
been
ever
and
ever
so
many
thicknesses
of
blue
gauze
with
shaded
lights
hanging
above
but
the
effect
was
mysterious
and
alluring
we
had
only
gone
on
a
little
way
when
we
arrived
at
a
tiny
house
built
apparently
of
red
flowers
and
there
was
a
red
light
coming
out
of
the
one
little
window
the
witch
of
the
woods
lives
here
said
a
card
on
the
door
we
pushed
and
inside
was
a
room
with
a
young
woman
in
white
as
hard
as
she
could
she
had
also
a
velvet
cushion
on
which
you
laid
your
hand
and
she
told
your
character
and
your
fortune
some
people
in
historical
dress
were
ready
to
come
out
just
as
we
were
going
in
and
one
of
them
said
it
madame
cortelyn
must
have
given
her
at
least
five
hundred
dollars
or
she
would
have
come
a
step
we
had
our
hands
done
and
the
witch
of
the
woods
told
me
that
i
had
come
from
across
the
water
but
that
i
would
marry
a
man
on
this
side
and
then
she
saw
some
one
in
the
crystal
who
looked
so
exactly
like
potter
parker
that
i
wished
i
had
stopped
outside
her
red
house
after
this
we
kept
losing
ourselves
in
different
paths
and
suddenly
coming
on
booths
where
variety
entertainments
were
going
on
or
funny
cardboard
pagodas
where
celebrated
japanese
artists
did
your
portrait
in
five
minutes
on
rice
paper
or
silk
tents
with
conjuring
shows
and
there
was
a
place
where
you
fished
in
a
small
round
pond
with
magnets
and
caught
little
metal
frogs
with
jewels
in
their
heads
which
you
picked
out
farther
on
was
a
miniature
eastern
bazaar
where
girls
in
gauze
danced
while
you
drank
turkish
coffee
and
pushed
spoonfuls
of
sherbet
under
the
lace
on
your
mask
and
there
was
a
kinematograph
entertainment
of
a
bull
fight
which
i
would
look
at
and
some
martyrs
being
reluctantly
eaten
by
lions
and
otero
dancing
all
the
masked
people
we
met
were
enjoying
themselves
very
much
and
saying
this
was
the
best
thing
for
years
and
it
really
was
fun
but
at
last
i
thought
we
must
have
seen
it
all
and
i
wanted
to
go
out
besides
i
was
tired
of
being
with
potter
who
would
be
sentimental
though
i
begged
him
not
how
do
you
propose
to
escape
he
asked
this
is
a
maze
the
proper
dodge
in
a
maze
is
to
be
lost
and
i
am
lost
so
are
you
we
lost
together
but
i
want
to
be
found
now
said
i
we
been
lost
long
enough
there
are
lots
of
other
things
to
do
and
there
all
night
to
do
them
in
said
potter
i
daresay
we
shall
be
lost
for
an
hour
or
so
yet
we
been
wandering
around
from
one
path
to
another
and
we
never
seen
the
same
thing
twice
so
perhaps
there
a
lot
more
to
explore
you
must
know
i
said
it
was
kept
a
secret
from
you
as
it
was
from
me
you
must
have
been
through
this
maze
heaps
of
times
and
of
course
you
know
the
way
out
if
i
did
i
forgotten
it
potter
coolly
remarked
then
he
changed
his
tone
you
make
me
forget
everything
betty
everything
but
yourself
you
not
to
call
me
betty
i
said
crossly
for
i
was
tired
of
having
conversations
turned
like
that
and
i
thought
that
i
would
be
having
much
more
fun
with
someone
else
for
what
is
the
good
of
wearing
a
mask
if
you
are
only
to
talk
with
people
you
know
there
something
else
i
a
great
deal
sooner
call
you
he
half
whispered
come
into
this
little
dell
where
the
fountain
is
and
the
orange
trees
and
let
me
tell
you
i
do
want
to
know
i
said
yes
you
do
come
along
anyhow
and
i
pick
you
an
orange
perhaps
there
be
something
nice
inside
it
like
there
was
in
the
head
i
was
to
be
bribed
in
that
way
but
he
took
hold
of
my
hand
and
pulled
so
that
i
had
to
go
with
him
unless
i
wished
to
resist
and
be
silly
several
people
were
coming
towards
us
round
the
twist
of
the
path
and
one
tall
man
ahead
of
the
others
dressed
very
plainly
like
a
puritan
was
looking
hard
at
us
rather
than
make
a
scene
i
went
quietly
with
potter
but
as
soon
as
he
had
whisked
me
into
the
little
dell
with
the
orange
trees
and
the
fountain
he
pushed
one
of
the
trees
and
it
moved
forward
in
a
groove
so
as
to
block
up
the
entrance
and
hide
the
dell
from
anyone
who
walked
along
the
path
that
not
a
bad
trick
is
it
said
he
i
had
that
arranged
on
purpose
on
purpose
for
what
i
was
silly
enough
to
ask
to
bring
you
here
and
get
you
to
myself
this
is
betty
bower
but
nobody
knows
it
except
you
and
me
with
that
he
pulled
off
his
mask
and
made
as
if
he
would
help
me
to
do
the
same
with
mine
but
i
stepped
back
and
almost
tumbled
over
into
the
fountain
perhaps
i
would
if
he
had
caught
me
round
the
waist
but
instead
of
letting
go
when
he
had
steadied
me
on
my
feet
he
drew
me
closer
to
him
i
gave
a
twist
and
a
little
angry
cry
and
just
then
to
my
joy
someone
from
outside
pushed
the
orange
tree
back
in
its
groove
so
as
to
leave
an
opening
again
i
darted
out
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
tall
puritan
man
who
was
apparently
engaged
in
pulling
the
tree
forward
so
as
to
close
the
gap
and
shut
potter
in
it
was
so
quick
that
i
hardly
had
time
to
understand
whether
it
was
being
done
for
my
sake
or
not
but
i
did
stop
to
think
i
simply
ran
i
met
harlequins
and
queens
kings
and
columbines
hunting
in
couples
the
green
alleys
were
only
broad
enough
for
two
but
i
pushed
by
them
and
went
flitting
down
path
after
path
though
voices
called
after
me
and
people
pretended
to
shiver
with
cold
as
frost
passed
then
suddenly
i
think
this
is
a
way
out
said
a
voice
i
knew
speaking
just
behind
me
it
was
the
voice
of
my
brown
man
i
could
have
recognised
it
among
thousands
but
when
i
looked
it
was
the
tall
figure
of
the
grey
puritan
who
had
helped
me
to
get
away
from
potter
parker
i
did
answer
a
word
not
even
to
say
thank
you
or
is
this
really
you
mr
brett
i
just
went
in
the
direction
he
said
and
in
another
minute
i
was
out
under
the
italian
pergola
draped
with
roses
and
wistaria
that
runs
for
a
long
way
overlooking
the
sea
then
i
glanced
over
my
shoulder
and
he
was
there
but
hesitating
as
if
he
decided
whether
to
come
with
me
or
go
back
when
i
saw
this
i
did
stop
and
mumble
in
a
low
voice
it
you
is
it
mr
brett
yes
he
answered
i
hope
you
forgive
me
oh
i
thank
you
said
i
i
wanted
to
come
away
but
how
did
you
know
that
and
how
did
you
know
me
i
could
help
seeing
that
you
were
being
pretty
well
forced
to
do
something
you
did
want
to
do
he
replied
coming
a
few
steps
nearer
and
there
seemed
to
be
nobody
under
the
pergola
except
just
us
two
i
do
suppose
i
had
any
right
to
be
angry
at
seeing
that
happen
but
i
was
so
i
did
what
i
did
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
as
for
recognising
you
i
well
you
rather
tall
you
know
and
have
a
way
of
holding
your
head
that
that
is
easily
forgotten
i
sorry
i
so
badly
disguised
i
said
laughing
but
i
glad
knew
me
i
so
glad
too
that
i
out
here
i
began
to
have
quite
a
stifled
feeling
how
lovely
it
is
in
this
pergola
it
do
you
think
we
might
walk
for
a
few
minutes
and
get
cool
i
walk
with
you
he
asked
in
a
humble
sort
of
way
that
gave
me
a
funny
little
pain
in
my
heart
please
do
i
said
quickly
and
as
cordially
as
i
could
far
more
cordially
than
i
would
have
spoken
to
any
man
in
ess
kay
set
it
nice
to
see
you
here
you
must
be
very
much
surprised
i
had
said
yes
before
i
stopped
to
think
and
then
i
was
sorry
because
it
showed
that
i
was
thinking
he
did
not
belong
in
such
a
scene
as
this
but
it
was
too
late
to
go
back
so
i
went
on
instead
it
a
good
surprise
it
more
than
kind
of
you
not
quite
to
have
forgotten
a
waif
like
me
he
said
i
shall
never
forget
you
said
i
why
of
course
i
could
and
i
noticed
that
my
voice
sounded
quite
earnest
just
as
i
felt
but
i
was
sure
that
i
ought
to
let
him
know
even
if
he
was
poor
and
unlucky
that
i
did
feel
so
sincerely
about
it
there
vivace
you
know
for
one
reason
what
about
vivace
oh
you
need
pretend
because
i
was
sure
you
gave
him
to
me
and
i
wanted
so
much
to
write
to
that
club
and
thank
you
only
i
thought
as
you
had
put
no
name
perhaps
i
better
not
i
must
tell
you
now
though
i
ca
think
how
you
came
to
be
so
kind
it
was
one
of
the
greatest
pleasures
i
have
ever
had
were
kind
not
to
be
offended
with
me
i
did
mean
to
take
a
liberty
i
thought
you
would
like
the
little
chap
i
love
him
dearly
often
i
should
have
been
dreadfully
homesick
if
it
had
been
for
him
he
always
seems
to
understand
if
i
feel
gloomy
and
he
does
his
dear
little
brindled
best
to
cheer
me
up
vivace
is
a
lucky
and
happy
dog
but
do
you
miss
him
no
for
i
like
to
think
that
you
have
him
you
see
you
were
very
kind
to
me
when
i
was
in
a
hard
position
and
a
good
deal
down
on
my
luck
there
was
nothing
i
could
do
to
show
how
i
appreciated
it
until
i
thought
of
vivace
it
was
our
little
talk
on
the
dock
about
a
lost
dog
that
put
the
idea
into
my
head
i
guessed
as
much
said
i
laughing
it
was
that
made
me
sure
at
once
who
it
was
i
had
to
thank
for
vivace
and
i
was
glad
he
had
been
yours
after
what
i
seen
you
do
on
board
ship
you
know
i
i
honoured
you
and
i
feel
proud
to
think
that
we
are
friends
you
think
of
me
as
your
friend
he
asked
in
a
voice
that
showed
he
was
glad
or
excited
or
something
that
was
quite
calm
indeed
i
do
think
of
you
so
i
assured
him
and
you
proved
your
friendship
for
me
three
times
once
on
the
dock
once
by
giving
up
dear
vivace
for
me
and
now
again
when
you
came
to
my
rescue
i
was
really
bored
in
there
you
know
and
people
seem
to
give
themselves
so
much
liberty
in
in
their
jokes
when
they
masked
i
have
to
thank
the
masks
for
being
at
house
said
jim
brett
you
must
be
wondering
how
they
let
me
in
considering
that
on
account
of
the
masks
everybody
had
to
show
their
invitation
cards
at
the
gates
i
had
mine
all
right
but
there
are
such
things
as
newspaper
reporters
as
you
know
to
your
sorrow
i
say
i
here
in
that
capacity
but
i
leave
you
to
draw
your
own
conclusions
what
fun
i
exclaimed
it
is
fun
now
i
had
no
right
to
dare
but
i
did
dare
to
hope
that
i
might
have
a
glimpse
of
you
i
was
sure
that
i
should
recognise
you
if
i
dreamed
of
your
being
here
i
should
have
recognised
you
i
said
you
taller
than
any
other
man
here
i
think
men
grow
tall
in
the
west
where
i
come
from
and
strong
yes
and
strong
too
thank
god
and
brave
men
are
brave
all
the
world
over
i
should
think
there
are
none
braver
than
you
brett
i
said
it
glorious
for
a
man
like
me
to
hear
such
kind
words
from
a
girl
like
you
though
i
do
deserve
them
he
answered
but
i
shall
try
to
deserve
them
all
my
life
i
shall
be
better
for
having
heard
them
from
your
lips
you
can
hardly
guess
what
it
is
to
me
perhaps
the
thing
that
comes
nearest
to
it
would
be
if
a
prisoner
for
life
in
some
dark
pit
heard
a
voice
of
sympathy
speaking
to
him
actually
to
him
from
a
high
white
star
oh
do
speak
of
yourself
as
a
prisoner
in
the
dark
i
cried
what
else
am
i
when
i
stop
to
reflect
how
hopelessly
i
must
be
removed
by
circumstances
from
glorious
heights
where
stars
shine
but
there
can
be
nothing
in
your
circumstances
brett
i
insisted
eagerly
which
need
remove
you
from
heights
i
wonder
you
so
brave
and
strong
and
an
american
too
can
say
that
of
yourself
why
you
can
reach
anything
do
anything
you
really
wish
if
you
just
want
it
enough
do
you
an
english
girl
a
daughter
of
the
aristocracy
tell
me
that
he
asked
i
do
as
if
that
makes
any
difference
any
real
difference
i
mean
when
it
comes
to
the
heart
of
things
oh
i
been
thinking
of
such
matters
a
great
deal
lately
i
suppose
because
i
among
americans
it
must
be
that
which
has
put
the
subject
so
much
in
my
head
tell
me
what
you
have
been
thinking
oh
i
can
hardly
tell
but
for
one
thing
i
begun
to
see
that
a
man
a
man
like
you
for
instance
brett
ought
to
call
himself
unlucky
because
he
poor
and
has
perhaps
not
been
able
to
have
as
many
advantages
as
richer
men
he
ought
simply
to
feel
that
he
has
it
in
him
to
make
himself
equal
in
every
way
with
the
highest
you
mean
he
can
as
the
saying
is
with
us
and
get
rich
so
as
to
stand
on
an
equality
with
millionaires
no
it
was
money
i
was
thinking
about
i
met
a
good
many
millionaires
since
i
been
here
but
i
seen
none
whom
you
need
look
upon
as
your
superior
what
i
mean
is
that
you
only
to
be
ambitious
enough
and
not
that
you
handicapped
by
your
start
to
attain
to
what
you
want
in
life
yes
whatever
it
may
be
you
mean
all
this
lady
betty
he
asked
quickly
you
have
as
much
faith
as
that
in
me
yes
i
answered
and
the
stars
and
the
sea
seemed
to
sing
with
my
thoughts
i
felt
uplifted
somehow
it
was
a
wonderful
sensation
which
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
but
i
had
an
exciting
impression
that
jim
brett
shared
it
the
music
of
the
hungarian
band
flowed
out
from
the
house
and
beat
in
my
blood
his
voice
sounded
as
if
it
beat
in
his
too
you
ca
dream
what
my
ambitions
are
or
maybe
you
would
say
that
i
sure
they
would
only
be
noble
ones
it
true
they
are
noble
yet
you
might
not
approve
but
they
part
of
my
life
i
could
give
them
up
now
and
live
i
should
like
to
hear
about
them
i
said
almost
more
to
myself
than
to
him
some
day
if
we
meet
again
and
i
mean
we
shall
since
you
have
called
me
friend
perhaps
you
will
let
me
tell
you
about
them
i
shall
ask
you
to
listen
but
not
now
i
dare
now
the
time
has
come
only
promise
me
this
lady
betty
that
you
wo
forget
me
that
think
of
me
kindly
sometimes
i
do
think
of
you
very
often
i
said
and
talk
about
you
to
vivace
poor
little
vivace
does
forget
how
he
did
whimper
when
i
had
to
drag
him
away
from
you
that
day
in
the
wistaria
arbour
at
central
park
is
unlike
that
arbour
is
it
there
wistaria
here
too
i
believe
i
shall
always
think
of
that
day
when
i
see
wistaria
it
is
odd
we
should
meet
again
next
time
in
a
place
so
much
the
same
and
just
as
unexpectedly
just
as
unexpectedly
echoed
brett
in
an
odd
thoughtful
tone
it
wonderful
that
we
should
meet
at
all
considering
everything
then
he
laughed
rather
bitterly
i
thought
are
you
afraid
of
me
lady
betty
after
your
experience
of
journalists
since
i
half
hinted
to
you
i
may
be
acting
in
that
capacity
afraid
of
you
i
repeated
laughing
as
if
i
could
be
i
would
trust
you
in
everything
as
i
said
that
a
lot
of
people
came
out
of
the
maze
in
the
marquee
by
the
exit
brett
had
found
for
me
they
streamed
into
the
dimly
lighted
pergola
in
their
fantastic
costumes
laughing
and
talking
and
the
beautiful
peace
of
the
blue
night
broken
only
by
the
throb
of
distant
music
was
gone
completely
i
had
thought
of
taking
off
my
mask
but
i
was
glad
now
that
i
kept
it
on
they
came
towards
us
all
in
great
spirits
having
a
game
of
follow
my
leader
and
their
leader
a
chinese
mandarin
was
offering
to
guide
them
to
the
cave
of
aladdin
i
was
glad
that
the
flame
spirit
was
in
the
gay
procession
evidently
he
had
missed
me
and
gone
some
other
way
or
else
he
was
too
angry
to
wish
to
find
me
again
the
crowd
stopped
to
speak
to
us
making
jokes
in
disguised
voices
some
of
the
things
they
said
made
me
feel
that
it
would
be
uncomfortable
to
linger
behind
with
the
puritan
when
they
had
passed
on
let
join
them
shall
we
i
asked
they
going
to
aladdin
cave
would
you
like
to
see
it
yes
he
said
and
we
followed
the
wild
party
at
a
discreet
distance
we
went
into
the
house
again
by
a
roundabout
way
and
it
was
until
we
were
in
the
big
hall
that
we
learned
just
how
aladdin
cave
was
to
be
found
on
a
background
of
dark
red
flowers
made
into
a
great
shield
and
hung
over
a
door
glittered
and
scintillated
three
words
in
electric
light
to
aladdin
cave
the
letters
had
been
lighted
up
only
since
i
had
been
gone
for
i
suppose
the
idea
was
to
make
everyone
go
into
the
maze
first
we
had
to
pass
through
several
rooms
and
corridors
all
of
which
had
been
emptied
of
furniture
and
lined
with
canvas
scenery
cleverly
painted
to
illustrate
events
in
the
story
of
aladdin
everything
was
shown
up
to
the
time
that
aladdin
went
down
into
the
cave
at
the
bidding
of
the
magician
disguised
as
his
uncle
and
then
came
the
entrance
of
the
cave
itself
which
was
done
in
imitation
rockwork
but
i
knew
that
it
was
the
way
down
to
the
cellar
either
the
stairs
had
been
removed
or
else
covered
up
with
a
theatrical
kind
of
embankment
that
made
a
winding
path
twisting
back
and
forth
under
a
roof
of
the
imitation
rock
and
sloping
always
downward
at
the
bottom
was
a
screen
of
spun
glass
made
to
look
like
a
falling
cataract
of
bright
water
and
until
you
had
passed
out
from
behind
it
you
saw
nothing
except
a
glow
of
rosy
light
filtering
through
the
transparent
glass
but
when
you
did
come
out
unless
you
were
a
stick
or
a
stone
you
resist
giving
an
oh
of
surprised
admiration
the
whole
cellar
at
least
all
of
it
that
was
left
visible
had
been
turned
into
a
fairy
cave
of
jewels
the
walls
and
ceiling
looked
like
rocks
studded
with
blazing
rubies
and
flashing
diamonds
the
rough
pillars
which
supported
the
floor
of
the
house
above
were
great
sparkling
stalactites
and
stalagmites
the
cemented
floor
was
covered
with
sand
that
glittered
like
diamond
dust
and
there
were
fruit
trees
and
rose
bushes
rows
of
tall
hollyhocks
and
buds
of
tulips
all
apparently
made
of
illuminated
jewels
something
like
the
transformation
scene
in
a
pantomime
they
once
took
me
to
see
only
a
hundred
times
prettier
at
the
far
end
of
the
cave
a
bright
red
light
kept
coming
and
going
but
i
could
see
by
what
it
was
made
because
of
the
laughing
crowd
collected
round
it
we
went
nearer
and
as
others
moved
away
we
took
their
places
so
that
at
last
we
saw
what
caused
the
light
and
made
the
great
attraction
for
the
people
it
was
a
giant
lamp
of
a
strange
shape
standing
up
to
the
height
of
four
or
five
feet
from
the
floor
on
a
pedestal
and
behind
it
stood
the
genie
a
fearful
and
wonderful
apparition
who
said
things
in
a
deep
bass
voice
which
made
everybody
shout
with
laughter
it
fred
kane
the
great
funny
man
said
somebody
the
genie
witticisms
came
whenever
anyone
rubbed
the
lamp
which
each
person
was
requested
to
do
as
he
or
she
approached
while
it
was
being
rubbed
the
magic
lamp
flared
up
and
gave
out
the
bright
red
light
seen
at
a
distance
and
simultaneously
the
genie
took
something
from
a
huge
sequin
covered
bag
he
had
looped
over
one
of
his
arms
if
the
person
who
rubbed
the
lamp
was
a
man
he
dipped
into
the
left
hand
bag
if
a
woman
he
dived
into
the
right
hand
one
each
time
a
beautiful
trinket
came
out
and
was
presented
with
a
low
bow
and
an
excruciatingly
funny
speech
suitable
to
the
character
which
the
person
had
undertaken
for
the
evening
his
wit
never
failed
brett
and
i
went
up
together
the
genie
crossed
arms
and
grabbed
something
for
us
out
of
both
his
bags
at
the
same
time
then
by
mistake
he
gave
me
the
thing
from
the
left
hand
bag
and
brett
the
one
from
the
right
we
walked
away
to
let
others
have
their
chance
looking
at
the
presents
we
had
got
it
was
funny
they
both
happened
to
be
rings
mine
was
twisted
bands
of
platinum
and
gold
forming
a
knot
to
hold
a
cabuchon
sapphire
his
was
a
thin
setting
for
seven
stones
set
in
a
straight
row
diamond
emerald
amethyst
ruby
emerald
sapphire
topaz
yours
is
meant
for
a
woman
and
mine
for
a
man
i
said
he
got
them
out
of
the
wrong
bags
but
they
both
pretty
and
so
queer
will
you
shall
we
change
he
asked
oh
i
did
mean
to
suggest
that
i
hurried
to
say
i
can
give
mine
to
my
brother
when
i
go
home
and
you
there
must
be
some
one
i
no
sister
and
there
no
one
else
said
brett
do
have
it
you
see
i
could
get
it
on
my
little
finger
and
wo
you
keep
the
big
one
too
it
is
as
if
i
were
like
other
guests
i
could
bear
to
hear
him
say
that
so
i
broke
in
and
insisted
that
he
should
have
the
ring
she
would
want
you
to
have
it
of
course
if
she
knew
i
said
and
besides
i
want
you
to
which
is
something
it
everything
he
answered
then
we
changed
rings
and
i
told
him
that
i
hoped
his
would
bring
him
luck
glorious
luck
do
you
wish
it
may
give
me
what
i
want
most
in
the
world
he
asked
and
i
said
that
i
did
what
do
you
wish
mine
may
give
me
i
went
on
what
do
you
want
most
great
wealth
he
questioned
me
i
shook
my
head
to
have
the
world
at
your
feet
i
should
know
what
to
do
with
it
to
have
the
one
you
love
best
on
earth
love
you
i
should
have
to
stop
and
think
which
one
it
is
then
i
wish
that
you
may
love
the
one
who
loves
you
best
on
earth
and
more
than
all
the
world
just
as
i
was
looking
up
surprised
at
his
tone
more
than
his
words
there
came
a
burst
of
music
and
part
of
the
wall
with
the
platform
on
which
the
genie
and
his
lamp
had
been
standing
rolled
away
the
other
big
room
of
the
cellar
was
revealed
with
quantities
of
little
tables
all
laid
out
for
supper
and
the
walls
covered
with
smilax
and
roses
in
the
middle
of
this
new
room
was
a
huge
illuminated
ship
of
ice
in
a
green
sea
everybody
exclaimed
and
laughed
in
their
surprise
at
such
an
unexpected
transformation
now
was
the
time
for
unmasking
of
course
and
there
were
shrieks
of
surprise
and
amusement
as
people
discovered
who
their
companions
really
were
for
a
minute
i
sure
it
could
have
been
more
i
forgot
brett
to
stare
at
the
great
glittering
ice
ship
when
i
turned
to
speak
to
him
he
was
gone
and
whether
he
vanished
on
purpose
because
he
did
want
to
unmask
in
a
company
of
strange
people
or
whether
he
was
separated
from
me
by
the
sudden
press
of
the
crowd
i
do
know
i
suppose
i
shall
never
know
i
only
know
that
i
lost
him
and
that
i
was
immediately
surrounded
by
other
men
saying
nice
things
about
my
costume
wanting
me
to
have
supper
with
them
and
asking
me
for
dances
afterwards
illustration
i
turned
to
speak
to
him
he
was
gone
and
i
was
immediately
surrounded
by
other
men
asking
me
for
the
rest
of
the
night
went
by
with
a
wild
rush
we
did
stop
dancing
till
four
we
young
people
and
i
believe
the
older
ones
played
bridge
we
had
a
second
supper
served
upstairs
towards
dawn
and
when
the
last
people
went
away
it
was
broad
and
glorious
daylight
well
deah
said
sally
cosily
when
everyone
had
gone
and
she
had
come
into
my
room
to
help
me
undress
had
you
a
good
time
splendid
said
i
sighing
with
joy
i
dancing
still
in
my
head
my
first
ball
katherine
does
call
it
a
ball
but
that
a
detail
had
you
any
proposals
oh
sally
how
came
you
to
think
of
such
a
thing
but
is
it
extraordinary
i
had
three
why
extraordinary
because
i
hardly
knew
the
men
americans
make
up
their
minds
quickly
about
what
they
want
so
p
so
i
been
told
accept
anyone
not
i
did
even
give
them
a
wee
mite
of
hope
dear
me
no
poor
potter
for
one
sally
i
do
wish
he
do
that
sort
of
thing
since
you
speak
of
it
it
makes
it
so
embarrassing
and
somehow
i
do
feel
he
really
means
it
i
always
the
impression
that
that
he
does
it
because
he
thinks
he
ought
he
like
to
marry
you
betty
there
no
doubt
of
that
and
one
blame
him
for
it
well
if
he
keeps
on
i
shall
be
driven
away
i
said
although
they
do
me
to
go
home
yet
for
for
several
reasons
i
do
want
to
go
either
i
having
a
wonderful
experience
but
have
you
met
any
man
you
could
imagine
yourself
caring
for
deah
or
perhaps
you
do
fancy
americans
oh
i
do
i
exclaimed
they
all
great
fun
and
one
one
man
met
i
think
superior
to
any
other
i
ever
knew
but
then
i
known
so
few
and
i
do
know
him
well
you
need
look
at
me
like
that
it
is
a
romance
you
dear
i
most
unlikely
to
know
him
any
better
ever
he
is
like
the
rest
he
is
like
anybody
else
i
ever
saw
now
said
sally
coaxingly
you
might
tell
me
if
he
one
of
the
three
who
proposed
indeed
he
is
and
he
never
will
why
sally
i
do
mind
telling
you
i
mean
that
brett
who
was
on
the
ship
and
whom
we
met
afterwards
accidentally
in
the
park
he
is
rather
wonderful
considering
his
station
is
he
he
be
rather
wonderful
in
any
station
that
my
theory
about
him
i
think
it
mine
too
he
was
here
as
a
newspaper
reporter
he
hinted
though
he
did
exactly
say
he
was
in
so
many
words
did
he
talk
to
you
yes
said
sally
indirectly
i
got
him
his
chance
to
come
i
gave
him
good
advice
said
i
laughing
all
about
his
future
and
ambition
and
things
like
that
i
hope
he
take
it
he
probably
try
all
he
knows
did
he
thank
you
prettily
i
not
sure
whether
he
thanked
me
at
all
but
he
gave
me
this
ring
and
wished
me
luck
with
it
it
was
the
genie
present
to
him
in
aladdin
cave
i
changed
with
him
for
the
one
i
had
but
this
is
much
prettier
look
dearest
sally
spelt
out
as
she
held
the
third
finger
of
my
right
hand
on
which
i
slipped
the
ring
where
do
you
find
that
i
asked
quickly
do
you
know
why
the
stones
spell
it
diamond
emerald
amethyst
ruby
emerald
sapphire
topaz
i
felt
my
cheeks
burn
when
she
gave
me
this
explanation
i
wonder
if
brett
knew
xii
about
a
wedding
and
a
disaster
it
more
than
a
fortnight
since
i
been
able
to
write
about
any
of
the
things
that
have
happened
to
me
the
last
i
did
was
on
the
morning
after
the
great
affair
when
we
were
looking
forward
to
the
pink
ball
in
the
evening
ess
kay
did
quite
have
her
wish
for
the
ball
was
a
moderate
success
but
it
did
seem
a
pale
pink
after
the
gorgeousness
of
the
night
before
and
it
might
have
been
still
paler
as
everyone
felt
rather
washed
out
if
it
had
been
for
one
special
excitement
mohunsleigh
engagement
to
carolyn
pitchley
was
announced
and
we
were
told
that
the
wedding
would
have
to
be
soon
as
mohunsleigh
had
had
news
which
called
him
back
to
england
and
he
wanted
to
take
his
bride
with
him
before
i
stopped
to
think
i
promised
carolyn
to
be
one
of
her
bridesmaids
but
five
minutes
later
i
would
almost
have
liked
to
change
my
mind
because
of
potter
he
was
asked
to
be
an
usher
i
did
know
at
the
time
what
that
meant
but
i
had
a
vague
impression
it
was
something
of
importance
at
american
weddings
so
that
i
was
sure
to
see
a
lot
of
him
if
i
were
bridesmaid
and
in
any
case
i
was
beginning
to
feel
he
might
make
it
too
awkward
for
me
to
visit
much
longer
with
ess
kay
however
when
on
second
thoughts
i
tried
to
get
out
of
my
promise
by
hinting
that
i
might
have
to
go
home
carolyn
seemed
ready
to
cry
and
said
that
if
i
threw
her
over
it
would
spoil
everything
the
wedding
would
be
in
ten
days
and
surely
i
had
been
thinking
of
going
back
to
england
as
soon
as
that
it
was
quite
true
i
had
and
more
than
that
i
knew
i
should
be
welcome
at
home
i
made
up
my
mind
to
get
through
somehow
and
told
carolyn
i
had
only
been
joking
she
had
always
wanted
to
be
married
at
grace
church
in
new
york
but
new
york
is
no
place
for
august
weddings
if
an
august
wedding
you
must
have
so
carolyn
invitations
which
appeared
almost
immediately
after
the
engagement
was
announced
told
everyone
that
and
pitchley
begged
them
to
be
present
at
their
daughter
marriage
in
the
drawing
room
of
the
château
de
plaisance
i
did
know
that
you
could
be
married
in
a
drawing
room
but
it
seems
you
can
quite
properly
however
when
i
go
home
i
do
think
better
say
much
about
that
part
of
mohunsleigh
wedding
or
some
of
the
people
might
understand
i
should
hate
them
to
get
the
idea
just
because
of
the
drawing
room
that
poor
carolyn
was
morganatic
or
something
she
seemed
ecstatically
happy
more
than
i
could
imagine
any
girl
being
if
she
had
to
marry
mohunsleigh
who
although
a
dear
good
fellow
when
you
know
him
is
a
bit
romantic
but
he
suddenly
blossomed
out
into
all
sorts
of
pleasant
american
ways
sent
caro
flowers
and
things
every
day
though
i
fancy
he
could
afford
it
gave
her
a
lovely
solitaire
diamond
ring
which
i
he
could
and
a
guard
an
heirloom
in
his
family
it
would
have
been
shocking
carolyn
said
for
her
to
be
seen
anywhere
after
the
invitations
were
out
though
i
ca
think
why
as
she
seem
at
all
ashamed
of
marrying
mohunsleigh
but
rather
the
contrary
and
asked
me
hundreds
of
questions
about
what
she
would
have
to
do
when
she
was
a
countess
fortunately
though
she
had
lots
of
things
to
keep
her
busy
indoors
trying
on
such
frocks
as
she
could
get
made
in
a
hurry
and
writing
letters
to
every
girl
she
knew
announcing
her
engagement
the
funniest
things
about
the
whole
affair
were
for
me
the
ushers
the
rehearsals
for
the
wedding
and
having
a
married
woman
as
a
sort
of
head
bridesmaid
carolyn
best
girl
chum
was
married
herself
in
the
spring
so
she
had
to
be
what
they
call
a
matron
of
honour
it
seemed
horribly
irreverent
to
rehearse
for
the
ceremony
but
nobody
else
thought
so
except
mohunsleigh
and
me
and
mohunsleigh
said
in
confidence
that
he
found
out
the
bridegroom
was
a
mere
lay
figure
at
a
wedding
anyhow
in
america
and
he
intended
to
let
caro
do
exactly
as
she
liked
until
after
they
were
married
then
she
might
have
to
find
out
that
once
in
a
while
it
would
be
just
as
well
if
she
did
what
he
liked
but
he
asked
me
not
to
mention
this
to
carolyn
and
her
stepmother
so
i
did
and
in
spite
of
my
objection
the
rehearsals
were
interesting
i
felt
as
if
i
ought
to
laugh
and
joke
but
the
others
all
did
tremendously
so
i
did
too
in
the
end
mohunsleigh
was
disappointed
because
that
californian
friend
of
his
whom
he
would
have
visited
if
it
had
been
for
falling
in
love
unexpectedly
and
getting
married
could
come
and
be
his
best
man
he
urged
him
but
something
interfered
mohunsleigh
did
tell
us
what
and
jameson
harborough
was
even
able
to
come
to
the
wedding
i
was
disappointed
too
as
mohunsleigh
had
told
us
such
romantic
things
about
his
friend
that
we
all
wanted
to
see
him
harborough
had
been
a
sailor
and
a
cowboy
and
had
left
everything
to
fight
in
the
spanish
war
where
he
done
brave
and
splendid
things
and
might
have
stayed
in
the
army
afterwards
as
a
captain
if
he
had
liked
but
he
preferred
to
go
back
to
his
old
free
life
and
was
still
a
poor
young
man
until
two
or
three
years
ago
when
some
land
in
which
invested
a
few
savings
turned
out
to
have
gold
in
it
quantities
of
gold
gold
enough
to
make
a
famous
mine
and
give
harborough
a
great
fortune
sally
knew
a
good
deal
about
the
new
millionaire
too
it
seemed
that
cousins
of
his
in
the
west
somewhere
were
acquaintances
of
hers
and
had
told
her
how
immensely
he
had
been
sought
out
and
flattered
in
san
francisco
and
other
places
since
he
become
rich
he
hated
it
so
much
that
he
gone
abroad
and
stopped
a
long
time
wandering
about
in
strange
eastern
countries
making
friends
with
bedouins
and
people
like
that
who
love
horses
better
than
money
and
on
account
of
certain
experiences
with
women
he
got
almost
a
morbid
horror
of
falling
in
love
with
some
girl
who
would
only
pretend
to
like
him
while
in
reality
all
she
cared
about
was
his
money
nobody
in
ess
kay
set
knew
jameson
harborough
though
everybody
would
like
to
so
it
was
a
blow
to
others
beside
mohunsleigh
and
me
that
he
could
or
would
show
himself
at
newport
for
the
wedding
with
the
exception
of
this
one
hitch
nothing
went
wrong
so
far
as
the
wedding
party
was
concerned
but
with
me
things
began
to
go
very
wrong
several
days
before
caro
and
mohunsleigh
were
married
there
was
a
fuss
of
some
sort
between
sally
and
ess
kay
and
sally
came
to
me
very
much
upset
to
say
that
she
would
have
to
leave
the
moorings
immediately
she
could
stand
it
hours
longer
even
for
my
sake
she
had
promised
to
visit
a
friend
in
chicago
sooner
or
later
so
she
would
go
straight
to
her
and
if
anything
too
tiresome
should
happen
before
i
was
ready
to
sail
for
home
i
had
better
run
out
there
the
friend
would
be
delighted
to
have
me
sally
gave
me
the
address
and
i
told
her
i
would
write
often
but
of
course
i
dream
of
having
to
accept
her
invitation
i
missed
her
badly
but
not
as
much
as
if
the
wedding
had
not
been
so
near
poor
old
mohunsleigh
who
knows
more
about
the
manners
of
polar
bears
than
etiquette
in
american
society
was
coached
by
potter
and
the
night
before
the
wedding
rehearsal
reluctantly
gave
an
elaborate
dinner
to
his
best
man
an
officer
in
stan
regiment
who
happened
to
turn
up
and
the
six
ushers
the
same
day
carolyn
had
her
matron
of
honour
and
the
bridesmaids
to
lunch
and
we
did
have
fun
talking
over
things
i
should
have
thought
a
luncheon
with
all
girls
and
no
men
might
have
been
a
little
tame
and
perhaps
it
would
in
england
but
in
america
girls
are
not
at
all
shy
they
say
just
as
funny
things
as
men
and
take
the
most
beautiful
pains
to
amuse
each
other
so
that
impossible
to
be
bored
and
for
hours
on
end
you
forget
there
is
such
a
creature
as
man
at
home
mohunsleigh
would
have
had
to
give
us
things
of
course
but
in
america
it
appears
that
the
bridegroom
makes
presents
to
the
best
man
and
the
ushers
so
it
was
from
carolyn
that
i
got
a
duck
of
a
brooch
like
an
american
flag
with
stripes
of
diamonds
and
rubies
and
the
blue
part
sapphires
mohunsleigh
said
that
as
he
was
awfully
hard
up
it
was
bad
luck
for
him
to
have
to
provide
each
of
the
bridesmaids
with
bouquets
and
chiffon
muffs
and
he
could
not
see
at
all
that
it
was
a
pretty
idea
for
everything
they
carried
in
their
hands
to
come
from
the
bridegroom
but
as
sally
had
told
me
that
carolyn
father
had
settled
ten
million
dollars
on
her
i
do
think
mohunsleigh
need
have
complained
although
it
was
in
a
house
the
wedding
was
very
picturesque
and
the
bride
and
groom
stood
under
a
bell
of
white
roses
about
as
large
as
big
ben
i
enjoyed
it
all
immensely
for
it
was
my
first
time
as
bridesmaid
and
i
had
a
lovely
frock
and
hat
copied
from
an
old
picture
for
which
when
i
wanted
the
bill
i
found
sally
had
paid
there
was
a
crush
at
the
reception
but
it
only
lasted
two
hours
after
the
bride
and
groom
had
gone
with
showers
of
rice
and
satin
slippers
we
stayed
and
had
a
dance
just
the
ushers
and
bridesmaids
and
a
few
young
people
who
were
intimate
friends
of
carolyn
it
was
then
that
my
greatest
troubles
began
on
a
pretence
of
showing
some
wedding
presents
which
he
said
i
had
seen
because
they
were
in
a
different
room
from
the
others
potter
got
me
alone
and
proposed
again
this
time
he
did
laugh
and
joke
as
he
had
before
so
that
i
could
take
it
half
in
fun
even
while
it
made
me
uncomfortable
but
was
very
serious
indeed
when
i
wanted
to
go
out
he
stood
in
front
of
the
door
and
would
let
me
pass
and
his
chin
and
eyes
looked
so
horribly
determined
that
he
was
more
like
ess
kay
than
ever
my
dear
little
ladyship
he
said
you
not
going
to
get
away
until
you
given
me
my
answer
but
i
have
given
it
said
i
i
do
call
what
you
given
me
an
answer
because
you
see
i
want
you
so
much
and
i
made
up
my
mind
so
hard
and
fast
to
have
you
that
i
sha
take
for
an
answer
i
do
see
how
you
can
help
it
as
it
the
only
one
i
have
to
give
and
i
told
you
that
two
dozen
times
at
least
i
said
beginning
to
feel
irritable
as
i
always
have
from
the
first
whenever
potter
talked
about
love
i
know
you
have
but
that
does
count
there
no
such
word
as
fail
in
the
bright
lexicon
of
my
youth
look
here
dear
girl
you
quite
realise
perhaps
what
a
good
time
i
give
you
if
you
married
me
i
got
as
much
money
as
my
sister
has
and
i
do
just
as
you
liked
about
staying
in
the
army
you
could
have
a
house
in
new
york
and
a
whole
real
live
castle
in
your
own
country
if
you
liked
i
care
a
rap
how
much
you
spent
on
clothes
and
there
is
a
woman
in
america
who
got
better
jewels
than
you
should
have
i
see
to
that
besides
you
could
do
what
you
chose
for
your
own
people
i
stint
you
i
want
to
be
friends
with
them
i
never
talked
like
this
to
you
before
but
you
see
what
i
mean
and
now
is
what
i
said
any
inducement
i
would
need
any
such
inducements
if
i
loved
you
i
answered
but
i
do
and
ca
and
somehow
i
never
have
been
able
to
believe
that
you
really
loved
me
if
that
the
trouble
you
can
make
your
mind
easy
i
want
you
badly
then
i
sorry
for
i
simply
marry
you
i
should
be
miserable
and
so
would
you
i
risk
that
you
too
much
of
an
english
rosebud
to
understand
anything
about
love
what
you
must
do
is
to
trust
others
who
know
what
you
ought
to
want
better
than
you
do
yourself
your
mother
for
instance
you
like
to
please
her
and
your
sister
and
brother
would
you
well
they
all
want
you
to
say
to
me
how
do
you
know
i
broke
out
i
know
you
can
ask
kath
if
it
is
true
i
do
want
to
talk
to
her
about
it
you
need
if
you
only
be
a
good
girl
and
do
what
everybody
expects
you
to
do
come
now
do
say
yes
and
let
be
happy
that
did
make
me
furious
anyone
would
think
i
was
a
naughty
child
and
you
were
some
kind
of
medicine
the
whole
family
was
waiting
for
me
to
take
i
exclaimed
it
a
wonder
you
do
get
out
your
watch
and
give
me
five
minutes
to
do
it
in
his
eyes
began
to
sparkle
with
anger
i
believe
he
would
have
liked
to
box
my
ears
and
i
know
i
could
have
boxed
his
i
thought
english
girls
were
brought
up
to
be
sensible
said
he
and
amiable
i
ca
help
what
you
thought
i
answered
rudely
for
i
was
getting
desperate
you
no
right
to
keep
me
here
like
this
and
it
wo
do
you
a
bit
of
good
for
if
you
stand
there
till
we
both
in
our
second
childhood
i
wo
change
my
mind
you
ought
to
know
that
now
parker
please
let
me
go
he
did
move
if
you
do
i
scream
at
the
top
of
my
lungs
i
said
and
he
must
have
seen
that
i
meant
it
for
he
flung
open
the
door
with
a
slam
and
i
swept
past
him
with
my
nose
in
the
air
trying
to
look
like
mother
illustration
swept
past
him
with
my
nose
in
the
air
trying
to
look
like
i
did
see
him
again
till
it
was
time
to
go
home
then
he
drove
back
with
ess
kay
and
me
to
the
moorings
in
the
motor
car
and
did
open
his
mouth
once
on
the
way
which
was
wonderful
for
him
and
seemed
somehow
ominous
i
had
been
too
angry
and
excited
after
that
scene
of
ours
to
feel
unhappy
or
to
worry
much
about
what
might
come
next
but
that
drive
short
as
it
was
with
potter
freezingly
silent
and
ess
kay
alarmingly
polite
made
me
feel
that
the
end
had
come
i
was
sure
she
had
been
told
by
her
brother
what
an
obstinate
ungrateful
girl
i
was
and
i
had
a
guilty
sinking
of
the
heart
as
if
i
really
had
been
both
there
was
no
sally
to
protect
me
now
no
one
to
advise
me
what
to
do
and
there
was
a
big
lump
in
my
throat
as
i
said
good
night
and
went
to
my
own
room
i
had
been
there
long
when
there
came
a
knock
at
the
door
the
same
determined
kind
of
inexorable
knock
which
mother
gives
when
i
been
found
out
in
something
which
she
thinks
it
her
duty
to
make
me
sorry
for
i
locked
the
door
and
would
have
liked
to
make
some
excuse
not
to
open
it
but
it
was
ess
kay
door
and
ess
kay
room
just
as
much
as
it
was
ess
kay
brother
i
had
refused
she
sailed
in
all
in
black
like
an
executioner
though
of
course
executioners
do
go
down
into
history
wearing
chiffon
trimmed
with
jet
my
dear
betty
said
she
subsiding
into
a
large
armchair
i
want
to
have
a
serious
talk
with
you
it
would
have
been
stupid
pretending
not
to
understand
so
i
just
looked
at
her
and
waited
i
daresay
you
can
guess
what
it
about
she
went
on
i
suppose
so
i
said
i
very
sorry
about
everything
but
i
help
not
being
in
love
with
parker
can
i
i
should
have
thought
said
ess
kay
that
your
daughter
would
have
attached
very
little
importance
to
being
in
love
apparently
she
has
been
as
successful
with
you
as
with
lady
victoria
believe
me
betty
there
nothing
in
it
nothing
at
all
in
what
in
what
you
call
in
love
a
girl
fancies
a
man
for
his
eyes
or
his
dancing
or
because
he
is
strong
and
she
thinks
she
in
love
with
him
but
it
only
a
fancy
which
passes
before
she
been
his
wife
for
twelve
months
and
she
wonders
what
she
ever
saw
in
him
then
a
year
after
you
have
been
married
to
my
brother
you
will
be
very
fond
of
him
and
you
will
be
one
of
the
most
important
young
women
in
america
as
well
as
in
europe
oh
my
dear
you
will
to
take
him
your
mother
will
never
forgive
you
if
you
do
it
was
quite
an
understood
thing
between
us
when
she
lent
you
to
me
that
if
possible
there
was
to
be
a
match
your
beauty
and
name
and
potter
money
really
a
very
good
fellow
a
temper
perhaps
but
i
would
give
much
for
a
man
without
one
and
like
most
americans
he
make
a
splendid
husband
for
someone
i
murmured
for
you
betty
i
assure
you
i
dare
tell
the
duchess
definitely
refused
potter
you
must
be
persuaded
be
engaged
to
him
let
him
follow
you
to
england
if
i
did
that
i
should
find
myself
being
married
off
to
him
before
i
knew
well
and
if
you
did
it
would
be
because
you
had
the
chance
to
change
your
mind
i
shook
my
head
i
must
go
home
to
england
i
said
but
parker
must
follow
me
ess
kay
face
hardened
i
afraid
if
you
go
home
after
refusing
potter
you
have
a
very
poor
welcome
my
child
the
duchess
has
been
kind
enough
to
take
me
a
little
into
her
confidence
i
do
think
she
would
have
sent
you
over
with
me
if
she
had
known
something
about
potter
and
your
affairs
are
arranged
yet
oh
you
need
blush
and
look
so
indignant
the
duchess
did
mind
putting
her
difficulties
in
a
letter
when
i
wrote
her
you
were
behaving
quite
satisfactorily
and
you
may
take
it
from
me
that
at
present
things
stand
like
this
you
must
go
back
an
engaged
girl
or
else
stay
away
until
lady
victoria
is
married
if
mother
were
different
i
should
have
hoped
ess
kay
was
exaggerating
but
as
it
was
i
believed
her
though
i
did
my
best
to
be
and
incredulous
till
she
remarked
that
i
could
see
the
duchess
letter
if
i
liked
though
it
might
be
rather
embarrassing
i
was
sure
it
would
be
and
preferred
to
take
its
contents
on
faith
but
i
was
so
miserable
that
i
had
to
keep
my
eyes
staring
wide
open
to
prevent
the
tears
dropping
down
i
was
tired
and
forlorn
and
homesick
for
vic
and
stan
and
the
dear
dogs
and
everything
except
mother
and
i
felt
such
a
horrible
weakness
creeping
over
me
that
i
could
even
imagine
myself
by
and
by
doing
what
they
meant
me
to
do
i
thought
the
best
thing
was
to
gain
a
respite
lest
ess
kay
should
drag
some
kind
of
a
concession
from
me
which
i
would
have
to
live
up
to
afterwards
i
ca
talk
any
more
about
it
now
i
said
i
believe
what
you
say
but
it
only
makes
it
worse
for
me
to
think
that
mother
should
have
made
what
amounts
to
a
kind
of
bargain
with
you
maybe
by
everything
wo
seem
so
dreadful
she
got
up
with
a
relieved
air
perhaps
even
she
had
been
enjoying
the
conversation
of
course
it
wo
said
she
it
wo
seem
dreadful
at
all
no
idea
how
happy
we
all
going
to
be
now
just
you
sleep
well
and
dream
sweet
dreams
and
you
wake
up
feeling
a
different
girl
maybe
poor
potter
has
been
as
tactful
as
he
might
be
that
because
too
much
in
love
to
be
clever
but
he
has
a
lovely
surprise
for
you
something
connected
with
a
certain
finger
of
your
left
hand
i
promise
you
that
you
like
it
and
now
i
going
to
leave
you
in
peace
for
the
night
i
ca
tell
what
savage
deed
i
might
have
been
capable
of
doing
if
she
had
had
the
idea
of
kissing
me
but
she
had
she
merely
patted
me
on
the
shoulder
and
went
out
leaving
me
to
stare
aimlessly
at
the
door
after
she
had
softly
closed
it
xiii
about
running
away
i
do
know
how
long
it
was
before
the
thought
came
to
me
that
i
would
take
vivace
and
a
handbag
and
run
away
to
sally
but
anyway
it
was
before
it
had
occurred
to
me
to
sit
down
sally
said
before
she
went
away
that
i
was
to
go
to
her
if
i
felt
like
it
and
sally
always
means
what
she
says
now
i
felt
like
it
so
much
that
it
seemed
suddenly
the
only
possible
thing
to
do
so
all
i
had
to
decide
was
the
best
way
and
the
best
time
to
do
it
as
for
the
time
if
i
did
escape
before
ess
kay
and
potter
formed
a
hollow
square
round
me
to
pour
their
volleys
into
my
heart
in
the
morning
all
that
was
prophetic
in
my
soul
said
i
would
never
escape
but
would
suffer
great
confusion
and
rout
as
for
the
way
it
was
more
difficult
to
make
up
my
mind
but
the
first
thing
was
to
see
how
much
money
i
had
in
my
exchequer
which
happened
to
be
a
gold
purse
sally
had
given
me
i
had
spent
much
and
since
coming
over
dear
old
stan
had
sent
me
another
fifteen
pounds
which
he
wrote
was
part
of
one
night
winnings
at
bridge
unusual
for
him
if
it
true
as
vic
thinks
that
he
continually
loses
altogether
i
had
nearly
thirty
pounds
in
hand
which
seemed
a
lot
only
i
did
know
at
all
how
much
it
would
cost
for
vivace
and
me
to
reach
sally
in
chicago
and
i
could
tell
until
i
had
got
irrevocably
away
from
ess
kay
and
the
moorings
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
two
and
in
a
couple
of
hours
it
would
be
light
i
must
sneak
out
of
the
house
with
a
dressing
bag
before
any
of
the
servants
were
stirring
and
meanwhile
i
must
pack
up
all
my
belongings
except
such
things
as
ess
kay
had
given
me
so
that
i
could
write
and
have
my
boxes
sent
on
by
and
by
as
soon
as
i
had
realised
that
there
was
a
minute
to
throw
away
the
worst
was
over
for
i
did
stop
to
grizzle
i
finished
getting
out
of
my
bridesmaid
dress
in
which
i
had
danced
so
gaily
a
little
while
ago
dashed
a
thin
frock
a
dressing
gown
and
a
few
others
things
into
my
fitted
dressing
bag
which
was
almost
too
heavy
to
carry
but
not
quite
and
then
stuffed
everything
else
except
a
travelling
frock
into
the
boxes
that
were
stored
in
a
huge
wardrobe
built
into
the
wall
i
made
all
the
haste
i
could
but
i
not
clever
at
packing
so
i
heard
some
clock
striking
four
when
i
had
slipped
on
my
thin
grey
canvas
coat
and
skirt
and
was
putting
on
my
hat
with
cold
hands
that
trembled
so
much
i
could
hardly
stick
in
the
hat
pins
i
had
been
excited
enough
the
day
i
heard
i
was
to
come
to
ess
kay
but
i
was
twice
as
excited
now
when
i
was
going
to
leave
her
i
felt
rather
frightened
still
i
could
help
smiling
when
i
said
to
myself
how
little
i
had
thought
when
i
learned
the
great
news
about
america
and
ess
kay
in
what
circumstances
i
should
part
from
her
each
step
vivace
and
i
took
in
the
corridors
and
on
the
stairs
seemed
to
make
such
an
incredible
noise
in
the
quiet
house
that
i
felt
like
a
runaway
elephant
eloping
with
a
hippopotamus
but
either
it
was
as
bad
as
i
thought
or
everyone
was
lying
charmed
in
a
magic
sleep
for
we
got
out
through
a
window
in
the
dining
room
down
the
verandah
steps
and
across
the
lawn
without
being
stopped
as
i
half
expected
i
knew
the
way
to
the
railway
station
very
well
for
i
had
often
been
there
since
i
arrived
the
last
time
was
when
i
saw
sally
off
but
the
question
was
when
would
there
be
a
train
and
a
good
deal
depended
on
that
question
for
though
ess
kay
and
potter
might
not
exactly
have
the
power
to
drag
me
back
i
wanted
to
get
as
far
away
from
them
as
i
could
before
they
discovered
that
i
had
gone
i
was
horrified
to
find
when
we
arrived
that
as
the
americans
say
there
was
nothing
doing
not
a
soul
in
sight
and
there
i
was
very
hot
and
hysterical
with
vivace
and
my
dressing
bag
looking
like
an
escaped
burglaress
i
had
been
so
nervous
while
i
was
packing
that
i
been
afraid
of
everything
even
the
soap
in
the
soap
dish
which
had
two
great
blinking
bubbles
at
one
end
like
a
pair
of
goblin
eyes
that
watched
me
move
but
i
was
much
worse
now
and
i
could
have
fallen
on
the
neck
of
the
first
official
person
i
saw
moving
about
the
station
after
i
had
waited
for
perhaps
a
quarter
of
an
hour
i
do
know
what
he
was
but
when
i
appealed
to
him
for
news
of
a
train
for
new
york
instead
of
calling
the
police
to
give
vivace
and
me
in
charge
as
a
dangerous
pair
he
scratched
his
head
and
said
there
was
a
milk
train
due
presently
if
i
was
mighty
anxious
a
milk
train
sounded
innocent
and
suitable
to
a
girl
travelling
alone
but
even
if
it
had
i
should
have
been
thankful
to
go
in
it
i
could
buy
a
ticket
it
appeared
in
the
ordinary
way
but
when
the
milk
train
came
my
man
introduced
me
to
another
perhaps
he
was
a
milkman
anyway
he
seemed
to
have
authority
and
he
said
as
a
favour
vivace
and
i
could
be
taken
he
was
a
nice
person
and
he
talked
a
great
deal
after
the
train
had
given
several
false
starts
and
at
last
had
got
off
i
sat
on
my
bag
as
i
had
on
the
docks
in
a
bare
curious
car
which
really
belonged
to
the
milk
and
sometimes
when
we
bumped
i
should
have
fallen
on
the
floor
if
it
had
been
for
him
he
told
me
all
about
himself
and
wanted
to
be
told
all
about
me
but
i
thought
nice
as
he
was
it
would
be
safer
not
he
asked
leading
questions
which
it
was
hard
to
keep
from
answering
unless
i
hurt
his
feelings
but
i
think
he
somehow
got
the
impression
that
i
was
going
to
see
a
sick
relative
though
i
never
exactly
said
so
i
do
know
what
time
i
should
have
got
to
new
york
if
i
had
had
to
travel
all
the
way
with
the
milk
for
milk
it
seems
objects
to
speed
but
after
we
had
jogged
along
for
a
couple
of
hours
we
crawled
into
a
station
where
a
real
train
was
ready
to
start
there
were
just
five
minutes
to
say
farewell
to
my
friend
and
buy
a
ticket
when
all
flushed
and
panting
i
found
myself
and
vivace
and
the
bag
in
a
car
different
from
any
i
had
seen
yet
it
had
no
nice
easy
chairs
and
plate
glass
mirrors
and
wire
nettings
in
the
windows
like
the
one
in
which
i
travelled
to
newport
but
there
were
two
rows
of
seats
and
when
the
train
moved
a
cloud
of
coal
smoke
poured
in
through
the
door
at
the
front
end
babies
squalled
children
whined
and
their
faces
grew
black
and
damp
with
mingled
dirt
and
heat
while
people
scolded
but
a
dear
old
lady
got
into
my
seat
before
long
and
just
because
i
helped
her
with
a
she
made
me
a
present
of
a
huge
peach
i
was
thankful
to
have
it
for
by
this
time
i
was
collapsing
with
hunger
having
been
up
all
night
without
anything
to
eat
the
peach
made
me
think
of
brett
and
the
little
basket
he
had
sent
me
on
the
docks
then
this
thought
suggested
another
he
had
said
he
would
do
anything
for
me
that
was
in
his
power
and
if
he
were
still
in
new
york
it
was
in
his
power
to
help
me
a
good
deal
he
could
tell
me
how
much
it
would
cost
to
go
to
chicago
and
he
could
show
me
how
to
get
there
i
really
believe
that
at
first
i
had
had
a
thought
of
seeing
him
but
once
it
had
got
into
my
head
i
welcomed
it
begged
it
to
sit
down
and
make
itself
at
home
i
could
have
clapped
my
hands
with
joy
when
i
saw
the
grand
central
station
and
the
delightful
au
porters
with
their
red
caps
it
looked
as
familiar
and
comforting
as
if
i
passed
through
a
hundred
times
instead
of
once
and
i
had
the
nice
feeling
that
now
something
pleasant
was
sure
to
happen
which
one
has
when
one
first
arrives
in
paris
vivace
brightened
up
too
and
he
took
me
out
rather
than
i
him
i
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
get
away
for
fear
potter
might
have
come
after
me
by
a
quick
train
and
be
looking
somewhere
that
i
flew
along
with
my
bag
and
vivace
without
waiting
for
a
porter
i
followed
other
people
out
of
the
station
with
the
intention
of
finding
a
cab
and
driving
to
the
club
where
brett
was
employed
but
though
there
were
dozens
of
hansoms
drawn
up
by
the
pavement
they
had
the
air
of
being
private
ones
it
did
seem
queer
that
so
many
people
should
have
private
hansoms
waiting
for
them
at
this
particular
hour
it
was
half
past
twelve
but
the
drivers
with
their
tall
shiny
hats
smart
coats
and
bright
clever
faces
the
glitter
of
the
harness
the
newness
of
the
cab
linings
and
appointments
all
forbade
any
other
thought
i
wandered
wistfully
along
the
line
wondering
if
there
were
no
public
conveyances
of
any
kind
at
the
grand
central
besides
the
trams
which
were
as
appalling
as
a
procession
of
african
lions
when
i
came
to
the
end
i
caught
the
eye
of
a
young
man
in
a
pale
gray
top
coat
looking
down
from
his
high
seat
at
the
back
of
a
dark
green
hansom
with
great
round
portholes
knocked
in
the
sides
and
it
struck
me
that
there
was
pity
kindling
in
his
glance
i
snatched
at
the
ray
as
if
it
had
been
that
everlasting
straw
which
always
seems
to
be
bobbing
about
when
an
author
is
drowning
one
of
his
characters
you
think
there
is
anybody
who
could
drive
me
i
enquired
meekly
you
bet
miss
said
he
i
engaged
myself
or
i
be
only
too
pleased
but
you
just
speak
to
that
other
gentleman
there
with
an
encouraging
jerk
of
his
sleek
head
towards
the
next
vehicle
take
you
anywhere
you
want
to
go
are
you
sure
it
is
a
private
hansom
i
breathed
up
to
him
in
a
low
confidential
voice
for
the
cab
he
indicated
was
even
finer
than
his
and
stan
does
look
as
smart
on
his
coach
on
a
coaching
parade
day
in
the
park
as
did
the
gentleman
i
was
recommended
to
address
sure
pop
said
my
friend
grinning
but
not
in
a
way
to
hurt
my
feelings
so
i
thanked
him
and
we
both
bowed
very
politely
and
the
new
man
who
had
heard
after
all
said
that
none
of
the
hansoms
were
private
anybody
might
have
them
who
could
pay
but
i
need
be
afraid
he
would
charge
me
too
much
when
he
asked
where
i
wanted
to
go
after
all
i
had
the
courage
to
mention
the
club
the
only
other
place
i
could
think
of
was
the
where
potter
had
said
any
stranger
who
liked
could
walk
in
and
sit
down
i
told
the
man
to
drive
me
there
so
he
did
and
only
charged
me
fifty
cents
which
he
hinted
was
a
very
special
price
we
do
want
you
english
young
ladies
to
think
bad
of
us
he
explained
and
i
assured
him
there
was
no
danger
of
that
if
i
could
judge
by
myself
they
would
let
me
go
into
the
turkish
room
which
i
remembered
very
well
with
vivace
so
i
had
to
give
him
up
to
be
fed
and
taken
care
of
and
i
was
obliged
to
part
with
my
bag
too
then
i
wrote
a
note
to
brett
just
a
few
lines
saying
that
i
was
alone
in
new
york
in
a
little
difficulty
and
remembering
his
kind
offer
i
ventured
to
ask
if
he
would
come
to
the
turkish
room
at
the
to
help
me
with
advice
a
messenger
took
the
letter
such
an
aggressively
brisk
child
i
was
sure
he
would
waste
a
second
on
the
way
and
as
soon
as
he
had
gone
i
was
beset
with
fears
lest
brett
should
have
left
new
york
or
lest
if
still
in
town
he
might
be
surprised
or
shocked
at
my
taking
him
at
his
word
i
was
past
being
hungry
now
but
my
head
ached
and
i
felt
dull
and
stupid
there
was
hardly
anyone
in
the
turkish
room
for
all
the
world
of
the
was
lunching
i
sat
watching
the
door
watching
the
door
until
i
seemed
to
have
been
in
that
place
doing
that
one
thing
and
nothing
else
for
years
my
eyelids
would
keep
dropping
and
my
thoughts
slipping
away
as
if
they
flowed
past
me
on
a
slow
stream
i
caught
them
back
again
and
again
but
at
last
i
forgot
and
let
them
go
the
next
thing
i
knew
i
was
raising
my
head
with
a
jerk
and
opening
my
eyes
to
look
straight
into
those
of
brett
it
was
he
there
was
no
doubt
of
that
and
yet
he
was
different
in
my
dreamy
state
i
think
how
for
an
instant
but
as
i
came
to
myself
i
saw
it
was
all
a
question
of
dress
he
had
perhaps
been
making
money
in
journalism
for
he
was
no
longer
good
looking
in
of
his
clothes
he
had
the
most
excellent
grey
flannels
or
something
of
the
sort
just
the
right
kind
of
collar
i
know
it
must
be
right
for
stan
always
wears
it
and
a
waistcoat
potter
himself
might
have
envied
i
did
exactly
think
of
these
things
then
but
i
must
have
unconsciously
taken
them
all
in
in
a
flash
for
i
knew
them
afterwards
by
the
time
the
flash
had
passed
we
were
shaking
hands
and
he
was
saying
in
his
nice
voice
how
awfully
sorry
he
was
to
have
kept
me
waiting
he
had
been
at
the
club
but
owing
to
a
stupid
mistake
there
had
been
some
delay
in
his
getting
my
letter
i
was
even
more
pleased
to
see
him
than
i
had
thought
i
was
going
to
be
i
felt
as
if
i
had
known
him
all
my
life
and
he
looked
so
strong
and
handsome
and
dependable
that
i
could
bear
to
take
my
eyes
off
his
face
lest
i
should
wake
up
and
find
him
gone
because
i
been
dreaming
him
i
tell
you
all
about
everything
if
you
sit
down
i
said
but
instead
of
doing
as
i
asked
he
enquired
with
a
queer
worried
expression
on
his
face
whether
i
had
had
lunch
no
nor
breakfast
either
i
replied
quite
gaily
but
with
a
watery
smile
good
heavens
said
he
going
as
red
as
if
i
had
accused
him
of
snatching
it
from
my
lips
then
you
must
have
both
together
before
you
begin
to
tell
me
anything
we
might
go
out
and
have
a
sandwich
somewhere
i
suggested
there
nothing
the
matter
with
the
waldorf
sandwiches
except
that
they
expensive
said
i
you
must
remember
you
and
i
are
millionaires
i
been
doing
pretty
well
lately
said
he
i
can
almost
call
myself
rich
please
have
some
lunch
i
can
afford
it
and
if
you
refuse
i
know
it
because
i
guessed
what
he
might
be
going
to
say
so
i
stopped
him
nonsense
i
exclaimed
but
i
run
away
from
and
i
do
want
to
be
found
if
she
or
her
brother
should
have
come
to
new
york
or
if
anybody
else
i
thought
of
that
said
he
quickly
but
we
no
time
to
waste
you
starving
if
you
would
mind
my
getting
you
a
private
dining
room
and
sending
you
in
some
lunch
but
i
want
you
to
be
with
me
i
insisted
he
evidently
hesitated
but
only
for
a
minute
i
do
think
he
the
sort
of
man
to
hesitate
long
about
anything
very
well
that
what
i
like
best
of
course
if
you
do
mind
said
he
i
go
and
see
to
everything
and
be
back
before
you
can
count
sixty
if
you
do
it
slowly
i
did
do
it
at
all
but
thought
how
thankful
i
was
that
he
had
come
to
me
for
i
was
sure
everything
would
go
right
now
in
two
or
three
minutes
he
came
back
to
take
me
into
a
charming
little
dining
room
where
there
was
no
danger
that
ess
kay
or
potter
could
pounce
upon
us
as
it
was
for
brett
and
me
alone
i
shuddered
to
think
what
it
must
be
costing
but
his
clothes
were
so
exceedingly
good
i
hoped
he
had
exaggerated
about
the
luck
that
had
come
to
him
naturally
i
could
tell
the
part
of
my
story
which
concerned
potter
parker
but
i
said
that
ess
kay
wanted
me
to
do
things
which
i
did
think
it
right
to
do
and
i
could
stay
in
her
house
even
a
day
longer
i
should
like
to
go
home
i
went
on
but
i
ca
yet
and
the
only
other
thing
is
to
join
miss
woodburn
in
chicago
you
remember
miss
woodburn
do
you
he
said
he
remembered
her
very
well
had
read
in
the
newspapers
that
she
had
left
newport
for
chicago
and
thought
it
was
a
wise
idea
of
mine
to
join
her
i
glad
you
think
that
said
i
for
i
want
to
start
and
i
hope
you
tell
me
how
to
go
how
much
money
it
will
be
how
long
it
takes
to
get
there
and
all
about
it
he
did
answer
for
a
minute
but
sat
looking
very
grave
staring
at
his
brown
hand
on
the
white
tablecloth
as
if
he
never
seen
it
before
then
he
said
curiously
enough
i
am
going
west
this
afternoon
too
would
you
object
to
my
being
in
the
same
train
i
would
suggest
such
a
thing
only
you
see
as
you
a
stranger
in
the
country
i
might
be
able
to
help
you
a
little
how
splendid
i
exclaimed
it
seems
almost
too
good
to
be
true
you
ca
fancy
what
a
relief
it
is
to
my
mind
he
looked
pleased
at
that
and
said
i
was
very
kind
though
i
should
have
thought
it
was
the
other
way
round
i
get
your
ticket
then
he
went
on
if
you
give
me
dollars
five
pounds
you
know
i
hand
you
back
the
change
but
afraid
it
wo
be
much
change
i
echoed
why
i
supposed
it
would
be
ever
so
much
more
than
five
pounds
to
get
to
chicago
which
is
almost
in
central
america
is
it
the
people
who
live
there
think
it
central
said
brett
but
they
make
the
railroad
men
keep
prices
down
so
that
dissatisfied
new
yorkers
can
afford
to
go
and
live
there
it
is
a
bad
journey
find
i
think
it
will
interest
you
you
sleep
and
eat
in
the
train
you
know
what
fun
i
exclaimed
i
never
slept
in
a
train
even
on
the
continent
if
you
had
it
would
be
different
from
this
one
said
he
can
you
be
ready
in
minutes
the
train
which
we
call
the
twentieth
century
starts
at
i
ready
now
said
i
the
sooner
we
on
the
way
the
better
but
oh
about
vivace
will
they
allow
him
to
sleep
and
eat
too
i
expect
i
can
arrange
that
brett
answered
in
such
a
confident
way
that
i
felt
sure
he
could
do
it
or
anything
else
he
set
out
to
do
it
really
was
lucky
for
me
that
he
happened
to
be
travelling
west
that
same
day
and
such
an
extraordinary
coincidence
too
are
you
going
on
journalistic
business
i
asked
no
it
business
i
undertaking
for
a
friend
he
explained
but
i
hope
to
get
something
good
for
myself
out
of
it
in
the
end
oh
i
do
hope
you
will
i
replied
i
sure
you
deserve
to
i
sure
i
do
said
he
laughing
but
i
shall
try
hard
for
it
all
the
same
you
know
you
told
me
to
be
ambitious
i
know
i
did
i
answered
a
moment
later
he
said
that
he
must
hurry
off
and
attend
to
the
tickets
and
i
had
only
time
to
glance
through
some
papers
the
waiter
brought
me
with
columns
full
of
mohunsleigh
marriage
when
he
was
back
again
with
a
cab
while
i
read
an
account
of
the
wedding
and
gushing
paragraphs
about
me
i
wondered
if
there
might
be
things
not
so
flattering
in
the
same
papers
if
it
got
out
that
i
had
run
away
would
there
be
a
scandal
i
asked
brett
in
the
cab
but
he
said
that
i
need
be
afraid
was
much
too
clever
a
woman
to
let
anything
she
would
like
get
into
the
papers
she
would
send
a
paragraph
to
the
effect
that
lady
betty
bulkeley
had
been
suddenly
called
home
or
had
gone
to
visit
other
friends
or
something
of
that
sort
but
she
will
almost
certainly
cable
to
your
people
he
went
on
yes
but
she
wo
know
where
i
gone
till
afterwards
and
anyhow
they
ca
object
to
my
being
with
miss
woodburn
i
answered
him
you
do
think
they
send
for
you
to
come
home
at
once
i
shook
my
head
they
wo
do
that
they
do
want
that
is
they
think
it
wiser
for
me
to
stop
on
this
side
longer
now
i
here
i
very
glad
of
that
said
brett
and
he
looked
at
me
as
if
he
really
were
glad
in
spite
of
all
the
trouble
i
made
him
xiv
about
the
twentieth
century
limited
and
chicago
the
train
for
chicago
is
perfectly
wonderful
not
like
an
ordinary
human
kind
of
train
at
all
i
in
it
now
and
have
been
writing
everything
about
the
wedding
and
what
happened
afterwards
because
i
have
a
whole
room
of
my
own
and
i
much
too
excited
to
sleep
there
a
bed
in
the
room
not
a
hard
shelf
but
quite
a
wide
springy
bed
with
electric
light
close
by
the
pillow
there
are
walls
made
of
mirrors
there
a
sofa
a
and
a
fan
netting
in
the
window
so
that
you
can
have
it
open
without
getting
black
and
there
would
be
plenty
of
places
to
put
my
things
if
brought
three
times
as
many
but
better
than
anything
else
there
a
soft
sweet
brown
maid
who
goes
with
the
room
and
is
an
extra
she
the
same
brown
as
the
porters
only
paler
than
most
and
the
train
was
ten
minutes
outside
new
york
when
she
appeared
to
ask
what
she
could
do
for
me
there
was
nothing
at
the
time
but
she
go
away
she
looked
about
for
a
minute
then
pouncing
on
the
palm
leaf
she
began
to
fan
me
slowly
and
gracefully
not
holding
on
by
anything
though
the
train
was
hurling
itself
through
the
state
of
new
york
apparently
with
the
speed
in
which
light
travels
round
the
world
i
never
could
remember
how
many
times
it
can
do
the
whole
distance
in
a
minute
but
whatever
it
is
it
has
the
air
of
being
a
boast
i
thanked
her
a
good
deal
and
said
i
would
trouble
her
any
more
though
it
was
very
nice
but
she
kept
straight
on
like
a
mechanical
doll
until
i
felt
that
in
common
humanity
i
ought
to
fan
her
if
anyone
in
england
especially
anyone
in
her
position
only
there
such
positions
had
asked
half
as
many
questions
as
she
did
people
would
be
extremely
surprised
and
offended
but
i
would
defy
even
the
crossest
person
to
be
offended
with
this
soft
brown
thing
it
would
have
been
too
ungrateful
not
to
answer
her
nicely
when
she
was
keeping
my
flies
at
bay
with
extreme
inconvenience
to
herself
so
i
admitted
that
i
was
english
told
what
county
i
came
from
how
long
i
been
in
the
states
where
i
been
staying
how
i
liked
america
where
i
was
going
now
and
ended
up
by
satisfying
her
as
to
my
age
and
whether
i
had
a
mother
i
also
stated
that
i
was
neither
married
nor
engaged
the
dear
creature
rewarded
me
for
all
this
by
telling
me
a
great
deal
about
herself
and
her
relatives
and
a
church
picnic
she
attended
last
sunday
where
there
were
more
young
gentlemen
than
ladies
which
always
makes
parties
so
nice
for
us
girls
i
must
say
that
a
mighty
pretty
hat
you
got
said
she
at
last
i
reckon
it
came
from
england
and
my
but
that
a
sweet
waist
i
give
my
life
for
that
waist
if
i
had
had
a
twin
sister
of
the
sweet
waist
with
me
i
could
have
resisted
pressing
it
upon
her
and
i
do
believe
she
would
have
refused
as
soon
as
brett
got
me
nicely
settled
in
my
room
he
said
we
would
meet
again
during
the
journey
i
was
sorry
and
wanted
to
know
why
so
he
explained
that
his
ticket
was
different
from
mine
i
hope
that
is
the
only
reason
really
and
that
it
is
because
he
thinks
he
ought
not
to
be
travelling
with
me
i
suppose
he
is
going
second
class
i
did
miss
him
at
dinner
which
i
had
in
a
grand
restaurant
car
about
half
a
mile
away
from
me
in
the
train
it
was
fun
being
there
seeing
all
the
people
and
being
served
by
fascinating
black
waiters
but
it
would
have
been
more
fun
with
him
i
longed
to
exclaim
to
brett
about
the
glorious
sunset
which
marched
with
us
along
the
hudson
river
for
an
enchanted
hour
and
i
could
half
enjoy
it
for
wondering
every
minute
as
it
changed
from
one
beauty
to
another
whether
he
were
watching
too
we
have
tenderly
radiant
sunsets
at
home
which
i
love
but
they
not
startlingly
magnificent
as
in
america
where
all
things
even
cloud
effects
are
managed
on
such
a
sensational
scale
i
saw
some
skies
to
remember
in
newport
though
never
one
like
this
but
perhaps
the
magical
charm
of
it
was
partly
dependent
on
the
gleaming
river
when
the
daylight
blue
had
faded
there
was
a
kind
of
dusky
lull
then
as
if
flames
leaped
up
out
of
the
clear
water
river
and
mountains
and
sky
ran
gold
reddening
slowly
till
the
colour
burned
deep
and
vivid
as
the
heart
of
a
rose
from
crimson
was
born
violet
soft
that
hung
like
a
robe
over
the
mountains
while
the
living
azure
of
the
river
was
slashed
with
silver
and
as
one
gazed
and
gazed
afraid
to
turn
away
there
broke
a
sudden
flood
of
amethyst
light
out
of
the
floating
haze
it
was
dazzling
for
a
moment
but
before
one
realised
the
change
the
brilliance
had
been
drunk
up
by
purple
shadows
the
outline
of
trees
and
melted
into
the
pansy
gloom
and
at
last
with
one
dying
quiver
of
light
all
warmth
of
colour
was
blotted
out
water
and
sky
paled
to
a
pensive
and
as
the
french
say
it
made
night
there
was
a
tremendous
menu
for
dinner
such
as
we
used
to
have
for
breakfast
on
shipboard
and
droves
of
things
whose
names
i
never
heard
before
just
for
curiosity
i
ordered
several
of
the
strangest
and
some
of
them
were
a
great
success
for
instance
there
was
succotash
which
sounds
as
if
it
might
be
a
guttural
insult
flung
at
the
mouth
of
one
red
indian
brave
by
another
but
when
it
was
figuratively
speaking
flung
at
mine
by
a
black
waiter
it
turned
out
to
be
something
more
in
the
nature
of
a
compliment
it
looked
like
beryls
mixed
with
pearls
though
it
was
really
only
green
beans
stirred
up
with
american
corn
and
the
two
got
on
so
well
together
you
felt
they
had
been
born
for
each
other
it
now
about
two
in
the
morning
and
it
seems
as
if
we
must
have
raced
across
half
america
but
we
have
a
long
long
way
to
go
still
so
says
the
soft
brown
thing
who
looked
in
on
me
about
an
hour
ago
to
ask
in
a
casual
way
whether
if
she
should
go
to
europe
to
live
she
might
not
be
taken
for
an
italian
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
my
nurse
used
to
make
up
tales
to
put
me
to
sleep
at
night
i
would
sometimes
get
impatient
and
tell
her
to
go
down
into
the
story
and
find
out
what
happened
next
just
now
i
feel
as
if
that
is
what
i
should
like
to
do
in
my
future
xv
about
seeing
chicago
the
first
face
i
saw
on
the
platform
when
we
arrived
in
chicago
was
brett
he
was
waiting
to
help
me
and
looked
as
fresh
as
if
he
spent
eighteen
hours
in
the
train
he
said
i
looked
fresh
too
but
if
i
did
it
must
have
been
excitement
as
i
written
half
the
night
and
dreamed
desperately
the
other
half
about
potter
parker
dressed
like
one
of
those
red
indians
they
have
for
cigar
signs
in
new
york
pursuing
me
with
a
jewelled
tomahawk
brett
had
insisted
on
my
telegraphing
to
sally
before
we
left
new
york
to
say
i
was
coming
and
asking
her
to
meet
the
train
therefore
we
were
surprised
not
to
find
her
at
the
station
i
was
rather
anxious
and
so
i
could
see
was
brett
he
thought
he
had
better
not
drive
in
a
cab
with
me
to
the
friend
house
where
she
was
staying
but
he
told
me
the
name
of
a
hotel
where
he
would
go
at
once
and
made
me
promise
that
i
would
send
him
a
line
by
the
cabman
to
say
whether
everything
was
well
with
me
miss
woodburn
probably
has
a
headache
or
perhaps
is
out
of
town
for
the
day
said
he
it
ca
be
anything
else
still
i
shall
be
a
little
uneasy
till
i
hear
and
you
know
i
hold
myself
absolutely
at
your
service
what
about
your
friend
whose
business
you
come
to
attend
to
i
asked
i
must
be
so
selfish
as
to
interfere
with
that
whatever
happens
oh
i
can
attend
to
both
interests
he
assured
me
without
neglecting
either
i
sha
need
to
let
one
interfere
with
the
other
and
remember
i
wo
stir
out
of
my
hotel
till
i
had
your
note
bereft
of
him
chicago
overawed
me
and
took
my
breath
away
it
is
a
good
thing
i
saw
new
york
first
for
if
i
come
straight
from
england
with
only
memories
of
peaceful
london
to
support
me
through
the
ordeal
i
do
know
but
it
might
have
affected
my
brain
for
one
thing
there
was
a
high
wind
which
seemed
to
have
a
fancy
for
making
off
with
your
hat
it
was
an
exciting
sort
of
wind
too
which
played
with
your
nerves
but
whether
it
was
that
or
whether
something
extraordinary
was
happening
just
out
of
sight
round
the
corner
of
nearly
every
street
we
passed
and
all
the
people
we
saw
were
tearing
like
mad
to
the
spot
i
do
know
but
anyhow
they
seemed
a
good
deal
agitated
and
there
were
more
varieties
of
startling
street
noises
even
than
in
new
york
the
cable
cars
were
like
live
untamed
things
that
scorned
to
wait
the
convenience
of
wretched
little
human
beings
such
women
and
girls
as
had
performed
the
feat
of
clambering
on
board
dream
for
a
moment
that
the
creatures
might
be
induced
to
stop
and
let
them
get
down
they
simply
hurled
themselves
off
as
they
could
and
my
heart
was
in
my
mouth
for
them
and
for
myself
many
times
while
my
cab
mingled
with
the
surging
and
apparently
uncontrolled
traffic
it
was
a
long
drive
though
and
as
i
had
time
to
calm
down
i
saw
that
numbers
of
the
huge
buildings
are
nobly
designed
and
very
magnificent
in
decoration
making
a
splendid
effect
in
spite
of
their
vast
size
rather
than
because
of
it
and
such
shops
too
they
like
the
fairy
palaces
my
nurse
used
to
tell
me
about
as
big
as
whole
cities
where
you
could
get
anything
you
wanted
just
by
wishing
on
the
way
i
made
up
my
mind
to
ask
sally
a
number
of
questions
why
they
have
the
curbstones
so
high
in
chicago
why
the
women
though
dressed
much
the
same
as
in
new
york
look
quite
different
and
have
a
style
of
their
own
even
in
their
walk
why
almost
all
the
men
are
young
and
why
though
there
is
such
a
network
of
trams
nearly
everybody
seems
to
need
a
motor
car
i
think
american
girls
must
be
braver
than
english
ones
for
where
with
us
if
a
girl
drives
a
motor
she
is
so
remarkable
that
her
picture
is
at
once
put
in
a
newspaper
in
the
states
a
girl
in
a
car
in
the
midst
of
howling
traffic
does
even
have
the
air
of
wanting
to
scream
or
faint
but
just
sits
straight
up
and
smiles
with
her
figure
looking
inexpressibly
french
and
there
are
two
or
three
of
her
in
every
important
street
there
was
a
wonderful
swinging
bridge
which
we
had
to
wait
for
until
it
chose
to
come
to
us
like
the
mountain
to
mahomet
and
presently
we
trotted
into
a
beautiful
avenue
near
a
startlingly
unexpected
blue
sea
which
i
thought
must
be
a
mirage
till
the
cabman
said
it
was
lake
michigan
but
who
would
have
thought
of
a
lake
being
like
that
the
only
ones
i
ever
saw
were
pretty
little
things
in
parks
where
you
fed
swans
at
last
we
stopped
before
a
large
handsome
house
with
a
lawn
round
it
and
no
fence
the
house
was
stone
in
front
but
had
brick
sides
which
gave
it
a
queer
effect
yet
somehow
did
spoil
it
and
wherever
there
was
a
porch
it
had
broken
out
in
bow
windows
i
told
the
cabman
to
wait
and
then
ran
up
the
four
or
five
steps
to
ring
the
front
door
bell
in
a
minute
a
maid
came
who
would
have
been
very
if
she
had
only
worn
a
proper
cap
is
miss
woodburn
stopping
here
i
asked
no
she
is
returned
the
young
woman
with
a
glint
of
the
eye
which
seemed
to
say
she
would
perish
sooner
than
call
anyone
miss
and
i
should
wonder
if
she
would
have
felled
me
to
the
earth
rather
than
give
me
a
ladyship
had
it
been
required
of
her
are
you
i
persisted
my
heart
preparing
for
a
plunge
bootward
i
guess
so
said
the
girl
with
a
superior
but
not
smile
she
staying
with
us
but
she
went
day
before
yesterday
i
think
she
be
back
because
she
gone
to
take
care
of
a
friend
real
sick
way
back
in
ohio
somewhere
way
back
in
ohio
somewhere
the
words
were
like
a
knell
for
all
my
hopes
i
did
know
what
was
to
become
of
me
now
i
am
sorry
i
said
do
you
know
if
a
telegram
came
for
miss
woodburn
yesterday
yesindeed
replied
the
young
woman
all
in
one
word
but
her
face
brightened
suddenly
she
was
looking
at
me
like
a
friend
i
guess
you
expected
hale
that
the
lady
of
the
house
here
sent
the
telegram
on
and
miss
woodburn
telegraphed
back
about
you
hale
went
to
meet
your
train
but
maybe
she
did
recognise
you
or
else
she
got
caught
at
the
bridge
anyhow
she
has
come
back
yet
i
guess
you
better
come
in
your
room
is
all
ready
for
you
my
room
i
stammered
why
yes
of
course
hale
expects
you
to
stay
with
us
till
good
and
ready
to
go
somewhere
else
you
like
her
she
a
nice
lady
if
i
do
say
it
myself
she
too
kind
i
exclaimed
i
never
heard
of
such
kindness
to
a
stranger
oh
maybe
you
have
been
in
america
long
said
the
kind
servant
i
guess
it
would
be
just
the
same
in
most
any
house
over
here
you
come
right
in
and
i
take
you
up
to
your
room
i
had
thought
at
first
i
could
like
that
girl
so
much
but
my
heart
warmed
to
her
and
her
mistress
and
everything
that
was
hers
only
i
could
stay
i
would
have
to
move
on
somewhere
like
the
poor
tramps
in
the
park
at
home
i
ca
do
that
though
i
very
grateful
indeed
to
hale
i
said
i
i
have
other
plans
i
just
scribble
a
little
note
to
tell
her
so
and
thank
her
then
i
must
go
she
just
never
forgive
me
if
i
let
you
protested
the
young
woman
i
began
to
be
a
little
afraid
that
i
might
be
detained
by
force
but
when
i
had
written
a
letter
to
hale
squeezing
vivace
under
one
arm
and
sitting
at
a
desk
in
a
bright
charming
where
three
persian
cats
six
japanese
spaniels
and
a
number
of
birds
played
about
the
floor
i
contrived
to
persuade
the
hospitable
creature
that
my
immediate
departure
was
practically
a
matter
of
life
or
death
then
i
threaded
my
way
out
of
the
without
squashing
any
of
the
little
tropical
flowerlike
things
that
hopped
about
and
according
to
the
maid
were
worth
more
than
their
weight
in
gold
i
knew
i
should
have
loved
hale
for
her
own
sake
and
sally
and
the
happy
family
in
the
but
i
felt
i
must
vanish
before
she
came
home
or
i
should
be
saddled
upon
her
and
she
would
feel
bound
to
keep
me
indefinitely
till
sally
returned
or
i
was
sent
for
like
a
missing
parcel
by
my
own
people
so
instead
of
writing
my
news
to
brett
i
went
back
with
it
to
him
like
a
bad
penny
he
must
have
been
surprised
when
he
heard
that
a
lady
was
waiting
in
the
of
his
hotel
and
hurried
in
to
see
me
sitting
there
i
should
have
felt
ready
to
die
if
he
had
looked
bored
but
he
did
a
bit
i
told
him
all
my
adventures
and
about
the
dogs
and
cats
and
birds
and
then
i
asked
what
on
earth
i
should
do
now
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
go
back
to
new
york
i
said
gloomily
and
cable
to
my
brother
i
could
stop
at
some
and
wait
till
i
heard
a
quiet
would
be
likely
to
know
about
you
alone
in
a
new
york
boarding
house
exclaimed
brett
never
then
could
you
find
me
a
chicago
one
there
be
nothing
to
choose
between
no
lady
betty
but
i
can
suggest
something
better
only
i
do
know
how
you
take
it
would
you
rather
be
near
miss
woodburn
than
anything
else
until
your
future
plans
are
settled
of
course
said
i
but
that
impossible
now
i
not
so
sure
i
think
in
fact
i
know
where
she
is
you
say
hale
maid
told
you
she
gone
to
ohio
to
take
care
of
a
sick
friend
i
can
tell
you
where
that
friend
lives
and
her
name
because
i
have
relatives
in
the
neighbourhood
i
do
often
go
there
but
i
heard
from
them
of
miss
woodburn
visits
my
cousins
have
a
farm
and
i
was
wondering
whether
you
could
content
yourself
boarding
with
them
for
awhile
so
near
miss
woodburn
you
could
see
her
every
day
oh
i
should
love
it
i
cried
but
would
they
have
me
they
would
be
happy
to
have
you
i
know
the
only
question
is
would
be
happy
they
simple
folk
with
simple
ways
such
as
you
would
expect
of
my
people
lady
betty
but
they
hearts
of
gold
like
yours
i
thought
but
i
did
say
it
i
said
instead
that
i
was
fond
of
simple
ways
and
i
asked
where
the
place
was
and
if
it
was
far
off
it
will
take
us
about
twelve
hours
to
get
there
he
answered
us
i
echoed
why
you
ca
i
can
if
you
let
me
said
he
growing
red
i
finished
my
business
in
chicago
already
and
what
while
i
was
away
it
was
a
short
affair
though
important
but
i
thought
you
were
going
to
leave
the
hotel
till
i
wrote
i
did
need
to
my
friend
came
to
me
and
we
fixed
up
everything
between
us
in
a
few
minutes
now
i
free
again
and
my
idea
in
any
case
was
to
drop
in
on
my
ohio
cousins
you
see
twelve
travelling
is
nothing
to
us
americans
and
they
would
like
it
if
i
did
just
say
do
you
do
when
i
so
near
oh
well
if
that
really
true
and
you
are
doing
it
only
to
help
me
said
i
with
a
sigh
of
relief
i
was
afraid
you
were
i
mind
the
journey
a
bit
if
you
were
with
me
but
i
do
hope
we
have
the
same
kind
of
ticket
this
time
do
get
mine
like
yours
wo
you
his
eyes
had
a
beautiful
expression
in
them
as
he
thanked
me
and
said
he
would
do
the
best
he
could
only
i
could
exactly
make
it
out
i
hoped
it
was
pity
but
i
afraid
it
may
have
been
as
i
must
have
seemed
rather
forlorn
depending
so
entirely
upon
him
the
best
train
to
take
would
be
this
evening
he
went
on
that
would
give
my
cousins
and
trowbridge
plenty
of
time
to
get
ready
for
you
too
for
i
wire
them
that
you
coming
but
how
could
you
pass
the
day
would
you
let
me
show
you
the
sights
of
chicago
i
it
would
be
the
best
of
fun
oh
i
glad
i
came
after
all
then
that
settled
i
send
off
that
telegram
and
one
or
two
others
and
come
back
with
an
automobile
do
look
like
that
please
lady
betty
it
is
going
to
cost
me
all
i
got
to
hire
one
cheap
here
besides
i
know
a
man
who
will
give
me
one
for
the
day
for
next
to
nothing
and
i
bring
you
one
of
those
silk
things
with
talc
windows
to
wear
over
your
head
and
face
so
no
one
will
see
that
lady
betty
bulkeley
is
chicago
i
do
know
a
soul
here
said
i
and
anyway
i
would
be
ashamed
i
shall
be
doing
no
wrong
of
course
not
or
i
hope
i
would
have
proposed
it
said
brett
then
he
went
away
and
in
about
half
an
hour
he
was
back
with
the
promised
motor
hood
and
a
dust
coat
both
of
which
he
said
were
thrown
in
with
the
car
for
anyone
who
hired
it
if
desired
i
was
as
pleased
as
punch
as
caro
pitchley
said
when
she
was
engaged
i
felt
i
was
going
to
have
time
of
my
life
and
it
fun
i
shall
never
forget
that
day
of
mine
in
chicago
with
brett
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
the
only
sight
i
did
not
want
to
see
was
the
poor
pigs
walking
into
a
trough
wagging
their
tails
and
coming
out
of
another
one
eventually
as
a
string
of
sausages
or
something
but
we
did
miss
any
of
the
other
sights
and
there
were
enough
to
last
us
from
morning
till
evening
without
stopping
once
we
bowled
along
wide
boulevards
and
saw
lincoln
park
and
the
midway
and
jackson
park
we
had
things
to
eat
on
the
lake
shore
near
a
pier
and
afterwards
we
had
ice
cream
in
the
old
german
building
of
the
world
fair
there
were
some
beautiful
lagoons
and
brett
rowed
me
about
in
a
boat
i
should
have
liked
to
stop
there
for
hours
but
there
were
too
many
other
things
to
do
we
had
to
see
sans
souci
a
sort
of
chicago
coney
island
which
was
a
tremendous
lark
with
helter
skelters
and
air
ships
and
a
laughing
gallery
and
a
trip
to
hades
i
would
miss
anything
and
brett
must
have
found
me
a
handful
i
afraid
though
i
do
think
he
enjoyed
it
almost
as
much
as
i
did
usually
he
is
rather
grave
but
before
half
the
day
was
gone
he
was
like
a
boy
we
talked
together
as
if
we
had
been
friends
for
years
and
told
each
other
anecdotes
of
our
past
lives
he
care
about
talking
of
himself
but
i
made
him
by
asking
questions
and
refusing
to
tell
things
about
myself
unless
he
would
i
found
it
a
great
deal
more
interesting
to
listen
to
such
stories
than
to
hear
about
the
history
of
chicago
and
he
has
had
the
most
extraordinarily
interesting
life
his
mother
died
when
he
was
a
little
boy
and
he
had
a
horrid
stepmother
who
was
so
cruel
that
he
ran
away
from
home
and
had
all
sorts
of
adventures
at
the
age
when
the
boys
i
know
at
home
would
be
just
beginning
to
look
forward
to
eton
i
had
to
draw
the
details
from
him
and
i
felt
so
sorry
for
all
the
poor
fellow
had
gone
through
that
i
longed
with
my
whole
heart
to
do
something
to
make
up
to
him
for
his
past
hardships
but
i
have
thought
of
anything
yet
that
a
girl
could
do
which
would
be
really
useful
the
best
fun
of
all
was
the
chinese
restaurant
where
we
had
dinner
it
in
a
queer
street
where
there
are
some
famous
pawn
shops
it
seems
and
i
wanted
to
go
into
them
but
brett
would
take
me
to
get
to
the
restaurant
you
go
up
a
long
flight
of
marble
stairs
with
two
grinning
chinese
like
watch
dogs
on
the
wall
at
the
top
nothing
could
be
more
modern
and
western
than
the
chicago
surging
and
roaring
outside
but
as
you
pass
the
guardian
devils
and
cross
the
threshold
of
that
restaurant
you
turn
your
back
on
the
present
and
find
yourself
in
the
far
east
i
liked
it
better
than
ess
gorgeous
aladdin
cave
for
there
nothing
imitation
or
stagey
about
this
place
there
real
lacquer
and
real
silver
and
gold
on
the
strange
partitions
real
chinese
mural
paintings
real
chinese
lamps
swinging
from
the
ceilings
real
ebony
stools
to
sit
on
at
the
inlaid
octagon
tables
and
real
ebony
chopsticks
to
eat
with
if
you
choose
instead
of
commonplace
knives
and
forks
of
course
we
did
choose
i
would
be
ashamed
to
bow
to
myself
in
the
looking
glass
if
we
had
and
we
pretended
that
we
were
making
an
actual
tour
in
china
as
we
ate
strange
yet
delicious
food
such
as
my
wildest
imagination
could
not
have
conjured
i
was
a
great
princess
and
brett
was
my
chief
grand
marshal
he
wanted
to
be
my
courier
but
i
would
have
him
for
anything
so
ignominious
i
reminded
him
that
i
had
counselled
ambition
and
i
gave
him
for
a
decoration
a
little
steel
and
paste
button
which
just
then
came
off
my
grey
bolero
where
it
did
show
much
he
immediately
pinned
it
under
the
lapel
of
his
coat
and
looked
suddenly
quite
solemn
as
he
said
he
would
keep
it
always
we
had
bird
nest
war
and
shark
fin
chea
and
duck
tone
arp
eggs
with
shrimp
yook
cake
called
rose
sue
and
ting
moy
which
was
a
canton
preserve
and
various
other
things
that
i
picked
out
from
the
names
brett
read
me
from
the
funny
yellow
menu
card
afterwards
we
had
tea
in
beautiful
little
cups
without
handles
much
prettier
than
those
which
mother
keeps
in
a
cabinet
in
the
room
that
smells
of
camphor
from
mohunsleigh
polar
bear
i
was
horrified
when
the
bill
came
to
see
that
it
was
about
half
a
yard
long
and
that
brett
had
to
pay
with
a
number
of
greenback
things
but
he
laughed
when
he
saw
my
frightened
face
and
said
the
dinner
did
really
cost
all
that
he
only
wanted
change
i
begged
him
to
let
me
go
halves
with
everything
as
i
invited
myself
in
a
way
but
he
told
me
i
understand
american
customs
yet
and
asked
if
i
had
the
heart
to
spoil
the
happiest
day
of
his
life
i
could
resist
telling
him
it
was
the
happiest
of
mine
too
that
i
had
never
amused
myself
half
as
well
not
even
in
newport
said
he
not
even
in
newport
i
repeated
it
was
delightful
there
and
everybody
was
kind
and
charming
to
me
but
you
see
i
had
no
friends
like
you
to
go
about
with
and
that
makes
the
greatest
difference
does
it
his
eyes
lit
up
again
at
that
and
i
could
see
the
blood
mounting
under
his
brown
skin
all
the
difference
in
the
world
he
answered
in
a
low
voice
then
he
looked
as
if
he
were
going
to
say
something
else
but
shut
his
lips
tight
together
and
did
one
would
dare
speak
out
the
truth
like
this
to
a
rich
man
one
might
be
supposed
to
be
trying
to
marry
i
remember
enough
of
what
mother
and
vic
have
told
me
about
proper
behaviour
in
a
débutante
to
know
that
but
i
never
wanted
to
talk
in
such
a
way
to
any
man
except
brett
which
is
lucky
as
he
always
understands
me
and
that
one
reason
why
it
pleasanter
to
be
with
him
than
any
other
person
i
ever
met
yet
xvi
about
the
valley
farm
after
all
brett
ticket
was
different
from
mine
again
but
i
suppose
he
could
arrange
to
have
the
same
kind
and
see
something
of
me
on
the
journey
because
as
i
asked
him
he
would
have
done
it
if
possible
we
went
back
part
of
the
way
we
had
come
the
night
before
in
the
same
grand
kind
of
train
as
far
as
cleveland
which
we
reached
in
the
morning
quite
early
we
got
out
there
for
no
fine
trains
like
that
stop
at
the
village
near
which
brett
cousins
live
and
he
said
the
best
thing
we
could
do
would
be
to
drive
to
the
farm
in
a
motor
car
it
was
about
forty
miles
away
but
with
a
good
car
which
he
could
easily
get
we
would
be
more
than
two
hours
allowing
for
bad
roads
if
we
did
take
a
motor
we
should
have
to
wait
half
the
morning
for
a
slow
train
and
then
have
a
drive
at
the
end
of
six
or
seven
miles
in
some
kind
of
a
country
conveyance
when
i
hesitated
thinking
of
expense
brett
explained
that
among
his
many
other
occupations
he
had
once
acted
as
a
chauffeur
therefore
knowing
the
tricks
of
the
trade
and
being
a
sort
of
professional
himself
he
could
always
hire
a
motor
at
a
nominal
price
this
settled
my
doubts
we
drove
in
a
cab
to
a
hotel
where
he
left
me
with
vivace
while
he
went
to
search
for
a
car
presently
he
came
back
with
a
smart
grey
thing
which
matched
my
clothes
and
not
only
was
there
a
grey
chauffeur
to
go
with
it
but
a
grey
holland
coat
for
me
and
a
grey
silk
hood
with
a
lace
curtain
i
do
think
they
do
things
well
in
america
brett
wanted
to
know
if
i
would
like
a
short
run
about
cleveland
before
starting
so
i
said
yes
as
i
love
seeing
new
things
and
it
was
beautiful
i
do
remember
learning
cleveland
on
the
map
of
the
states
when
i
did
geography
so
i
had
realised
that
it
could
be
important
but
bournemouth
and
folkeston
and
harrogate
rolled
into
one
fill
it
and
cleveland
is
a
great
deal
grander
than
any
of
them
even
bellevue
avenue
in
newport
is
hardly
handsomer
than
euclid
but
what
an
odd
name
to
give
a
street
but
to
me
the
names
of
streets
in
america
do
sound
as
interesting
and
individual
as
ours
do
i
looked
forward
to
seeing
the
country
between
cleveland
and
aristo
which
is
the
name
of
the
town
nearest
to
the
valley
farm
because
except
for
the
drives
i
had
had
near
newport
i
knew
nothing
at
all
of
the
real
country
in
america
i
had
an
idea
that
we
should
pass
some
fine
country
houses
and
see
a
number
of
pretty
little
nestling
villages
the
name
of
aristo
was
rather
impressive
and
classical
sounding
i
thought
and
i
had
visions
of
meeting
on
the
way
pretty
girls
driving
or
riding
and
men
such
as
i
had
met
always
in
the
country
round
newport
but
as
we
went
on
and
on
i
was
disappointed
the
scenery
itself
was
lovely
rich
and
peaceful
with
groves
of
maple
trees
which
would
have
been
quite
new
to
me
if
i
seen
a
few
in
the
east
but
the
villages
were
blots
rather
than
beauty
spots
and
we
saw
only
peasants
and
farm
people
brett
was
driving
the
car
with
me
beside
him
while
the
chauffeur
sat
behind
and
i
made
some
such
remark
to
him
before
i
stopped
to
remember
that
his
relatives
were
farm
people
i
could
have
bitten
my
tongue
then
but
he
did
seem
to
be
offended
outside
the
towns
in
the
west
there
are
few
of
what
would
call
gentlefolk
said
he
with
just
the
faintest
emphasis
of
scorn
for
english
prejudice
nor
are
there
any
houses
as
you
understand
the
name
in
england
here
people
live
in
the
country
to
till
the
land
and
to
live
by
tilling
it
yet
they
do
call
themselves
either
it
is
that
they
snobbish
and
want
to
seem
to
be
what
they
are
not
do
think
that
for
a
moment
but
they
well
i
wo
try
to
describe
them
many
people
from
the
old
world
would
never
understand
what
they
really
are
or
their
point
of
view
but
you
will
lady
betty
you
are
quick
and
sympathetic
and
intelligent
and
when
i
ask
you
to
define
for
me
the
difference
between
the
farmers
of
ohio
as
typified
by
my
cousins
and
their
neighbours
in
summer
county
i
shall
be
surprised
if
you
do
exactly
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
surprise
you
a
little
at
first
i
warn
you
and
for
about
ten
minutes
maybe
you
wo
know
what
to
make
of
them
but
i
count
on
you
to
see
the
point
in
spite
of
all
your
traditions
what
have
my
traditions
got
to
do
with
it
i
asked
wait
and
see
i
laughed
well
i
only
wish
i
knew
what
my
traditions
are
said
i
i
suppose
i
ought
to
know
but
i
do
think
i
do
you
may
feel
them
prickling
up
and
down
your
spine
for
a
bit
while
you
getting
used
to
a
new
order
of
things
at
the
valley
farm
answered
brett
and
yet
i
do
know
i
shall
be
enormously
interested
in
watching
the
effect
upon
you
before
i
have
to
say
i
forgot
everything
else
he
had
been
saying
when
i
heard
that
last
sentence
will
you
have
to
say
soon
i
asked
in
a
crestfallen
voice
he
did
speak
for
a
minute
perhaps
on
account
of
a
series
of
bumps
in
the
road
which
though
so
pretty
was
much
worse
for
driving
than
any
i
have
seen
at
home
i
do
believe
englishmen
would
stand
it
they
would
keep
writing
to
and
signing
their
letters
motorist
or
sportsman
or
mother
of
ten
cyclists
till
somebody
was
forced
to
do
something
at
last
he
said
to
tell
you
the
truth
lady
betty
i
should
like
to
stop
and
pay
my
cousins
a
little
visit
but
i
do
know
if
i
have
a
right
to
oh
why
not
i
asked
would
they
be
delighted
to
keep
you
perhaps
i
hope
so
but
what
about
you
if
it
depended
one
bit
on
me
you
make
a
visit
would
you
really
mind
seeing
me
hanging
around
sometimes
just
at
meals
you
know
or
to
take
you
a
drive
once
in
awhile
i
looked
at
him
merrily
through
my
talc
window
for
i
felt
happy
and
and
the
world
seemed
such
a
very
nice
place
to
live
in
at
that
moment
do
you
truly
need
to
have
me
answer
that
question
i
asked
if
you
do
we
ca
be
real
friends
as
i
thought
after
all
you
say
that
because
you
are
kind
too
kind
to
have
reflected
enough
perhaps
an
accident
the
happiest
accident
in
the
world
for
me
has
given
me
a
chance
to
see
something
of
you
lady
betty
but
do
you
understand
that
only
by
an
accident
could
a
rough
fellow
like
me
have
any
place
at
all
in
your
life
no
matter
how
small
or
temporary
i
do
want
to
take
advantage
of
that
sweet
kindness
of
yours
which
is
partly
all
your
own
and
partly
the
essence
of
your
youth
and
innocence
now
you
are
making
me
very
cross
said
i
i
wo
hear
you
talk
so
you
may
laugh
at
me
because
we
known
each
other
such
a
short
time
but
really
and
truly
you
are
the
best
friend
i
ever
had
i
lose
you
for
anyone
or
anything
in
the
world
and
do
mean
to
unless
you
get
tired
of
me
so
there
tired
of
you
good
heavens
i
tired
of
you
very
well
then
said
i
flippantly
so
far
as
i
concerned
you
need
say
to
the
valley
farm
till
you
feel
the
first
symptoms
coming
on
lady
betty
remarked
brett
i
wonder
if
there
another
girl
like
you
in
the
world
according
to
my
mother
there
is
another
so
vexing
i
replied
we
both
laughed
and
then
he
suddenly
said
here
is
aristo
i
stared
about
wildly
where
where
i
asked
he
laughed
a
great
deal
more
why
you
looking
right
at
the
postoffice
and
the
grocery
and
drygoods
store
sure
enough
there
was
a
brown
wooden
building
at
the
top
of
a
dusty
hill
we
were
just
climbing
but
there
was
nothing
else
anywhere
except
a
clear
brown
creek
and
some
meadows
with
a
white
horse
gazing
in
a
bored
way
over
rather
a
queer
fence
and
some
cows
asleep
under
a
clump
of
maple
trees
on
our
side
of
a
young
birch
grove
where
the
rest
of
it
i
went
on
where
are
the
other
shops
and
the
houses
and
the
people
oh
the
other
shops
and
the
houses
are
built
yet
but
they
may
be
any
time
and
then
the
people
will
come
but
the
fact
that
they
come
yet
does
prevent
this
from
being
aristo
the
slow
trains
from
cleveland
stop
just
behind
that
hill
several
times
a
day
which
is
very
convenient
for
the
farmers
in
the
neighbourhood
otherwise
they
would
have
to
go
all
the
way
to
arcona
twelve
miles
away
but
you
must
think
this
is
the
only
place
you
will
have
to
do
your
shopping
when
you
at
the
valley
farm
wait
till
you
see
hermann
corners
there
a
great
emporium
there
and
you
ruffle
the
feelings
of
half
the
ladies
of
summer
county
if
you
do
fall
in
love
with
it
and
its
proprietor
whit
walker
promise
you
let
me
be
the
first
one
to
introduce
you
to
both
i
promised
and
wanted
to
be
prepared
for
what
i
must
expect
to
find
but
brett
would
tell
me
nothing
he
said
that
neither
the
great
whit
walker
nor
hermann
corners
emporium
could
possibly
be
described
for
the
comprehension
of
a
foreigner
we
were
in
a
sweet
and
gracious
country
now
it
looked
as
if
mother
nature
would
never
allow
any
of
her
children
who
obeyed
her
to
be
poor
or
unhappy
here
as
we
whizzed
along
the
up
and
down
road
between
billowing
meadows
of
grain
we
could
see
here
and
there
a
farm
house
showing
between
trees
or
peering
over
the
brow
of
a
rounded
hill
but
there
was
none
where
i
longed
to
stop
until
we
came
in
sight
of
a
dear
old
house
old
not
what
some
americans
call
old
it
was
set
back
several
hundred
yards
from
the
road
and
an
avenue
of
magnificent
maples
each
one
a
great
green
temple
led
up
to
the
comfortable
porch
which
sheltered
the
door
there
was
an
garden
on
one
side
with
a
running
flame
of
hollyhocks
hemming
it
in
the
background
was
a
dark
green
oak
and
maple
grove
and
in
a
clover
meadow
beyond
the
garden
was
a
colony
of
beehives
it
looked
an
ideal
storybook
place
and
i
wished
it
might
be
the
valley
farm
but
thought
such
a
thing
too
good
to
be
true
when
one
is
going
to
stop
at
a
house
one
has
never
seen
as
vic
says
it
usually
turns
out
to
be
the
one
of
all
others
you
like
least
so
i
was
delighted
when
we
turned
in
at
the
open
gate
with
its
guardian
apple
tree
on
either
side
we
sailed
up
the
avenue
under
the
maples
but
instead
of
making
for
the
front
entrance
turned
off
into
a
farm
road
which
led
round
the
side
of
the
house
and
the
tooting
of
our
horn
brought
three
women
smiling
and
waving
to
a
door
under
a
long
narrow
verandah
before
we
stopped
one
was
a
tall
thin
woman
with
hair
pulled
away
from
her
forehead
and
done
in
a
knob
at
the
back
of
her
head
her
skin
was
sunburned
she
wore
a
black
and
white
print
frock
without
so
much
as
a
ruffle
or
tuck
and
her
sleeves
were
rolled
up
over
her
arms
above
the
elbow
she
had
no
real
pretensions
to
being
pretty
and
yet
somehow
she
was
one
of
the
women
i
ever
saw
she
had
the
sort
of
expression
in
her
eyes
and
in
her
smile
you
would
like
your
mother
to
have
if
you
could
have
had
your
mother
made
to
order
exactly
according
to
your
own
ideas
on
her
right
stood
a
very
pretty
girl
with
a
dazzling
white
complexion
all
the
whiter
for
a
of
freckles
black
eyes
rather
deep
set
dimples
and
a
quantity
of
curly
hair
wound
in
a
crown
of
braids
round
her
head
she
was
in
print
too
but
it
was
blue
and
very
becoming
on
the
tall
woman
left
was
another
girl
also
pretty
though
in
a
florid
way
with
great
blue
eyes
a
full
mouth
and
a
fringe
down
to
her
eyebrows
she
was
more
elaborately
dressed
than
the
others
with
a
lot
of
coarse
lace
on
her
blouse
and
a
pink
skirt
but
she
had
the
look
of
simple
refinement
which
the
first
two
had
in
spite
of
their
plain
clothes
and
sleeves
all
three
waved
something
excitedly
one
had
a
huge
kitchen
spoon
another
a
book
and
the
third
a
towel
howdy
cousin
jim
cried
the
nice
woman
with
the
expression
as
brett
stopped
the
car
in
front
of
the
door
we
mighty
glad
to
see
you
again
this
is
the
young
lady
bulkeley
is
it
we
mighty
glad
to
see
her
too
and
we
going
to
try
to
make
her
as
happy
as
we
can
i
knew
you
would
cousin
fanny
or
i
would
have
brought
her
to
you
said
brett
jumping
out
and
helping
me
down
but
she
lady
betty
i
thought
that
would
be
a
little
too
familiar
to
begin
with
said
the
dear
woman
with
a
perfectly
angelic
smile
and
a
pleasant
american
accent
with
rather
more
roll
of
the
r
than
i
heard
in
the
east
but
you
shall
be
called
just
what
you
like
best
my
dear
shall
i
then
i
should
like
you
to
call
me
betty
said
i
shaking
hands
hard
with
brett
cousin
fanny
and
my
heart
warming
to
her
for
her
own
sake
as
well
as
his
there
was
a
good
smell
about
her
of
linen
dried
on
the
grass
and
of
cake
i
can
never
smell
those
smells
i
know
without
remembering
her
she
smiled
and
pressed
my
hand
why
you
are
just
like
an
american
girl
my
dear
she
exclaimed
not
a
bit
stiff
and
english
like
we
supposed
you
would
be
we
all
thought
we
were
going
to
be
afraid
of
you
but
i
guess
we
wo
will
we
patty
and
ide
i
saw
that
i
was
expected
to
take
this
as
an
introduction
i
smiled
and
bowed
to
the
two
girls
and
when
they
put
out
their
hands
i
put
mine
out
too
they
did
lift
my
hand
up
high
to
shake
as
people
do
at
home
a
little
and
as
they
do
in
new
york
and
newport
a
great
deal
more
but
just
thumped
it
up
and
down
cordially
in
about
the
longitude
of
their
waists
i
very
happy
to
know
you
said
patty
the
pretty
one
how
you
do
enquired
ide
the
one
with
the
fringe
i
fancied
that
they
must
both
be
trowbridge
daughters
but
she
continued
the
ceremony
of
presentation
by
saying
patty
is
miss
pinkerton
and
ide
is
miss
jay
they
generally
stay
with
trowbridge
and
me
pretty
nearly
all
the
year
round
patty
takes
music
lessons
in
arcona
twice
a
week
and
keeps
up
her
other
studies
and
ide
helps
me
look
after
the
house
and
the
milk
i
should
have
hard
work
to
get
along
without
either
one
of
them
it
seems
to
me
and
i
expect
i
shall
be
feeling
just
the
same
way
about
you
before
you
leave
us
here
comes
trowbridge
now
see
cousin
jim
here
comes
your
cousin
hezekiah
he
been
hiving
a
swarm
of
bees
that
why
he
got
that
mosquito
net
veil
around
his
hat
something
like
your
automobile
one
lady
betty
a
man
of
fifty
or
more
in
white
duck
trousers
and
a
bluish
shirt
with
a
collar
a
little
open
at
the
neck
was
coming
towards
the
house
from
the
direction
of
the
beehive
colony
he
had
on
no
coat
in
fact
i
think
a
grey
linen
thing
hanging
over
a
wooden
on
the
verandah
must
have
been
his
his
battered
straw
hat
with
the
veil
which
trowbridge
had
mentioned
was
on
the
back
of
his
head
and
when
he
saw
us
he
snatched
it
off
and
waved
it
as
his
wife
had
waved
her
spoon
and
ide
her
towel
from
a
distance
he
looked
just
an
ordinary
farmer
but
when
he
came
near
enough
for
me
to
make
out
his
features
i
saw
that
he
was
very
far
from
ordinary
he
had
a
splendid
head
the
head
of
a
statesman
and
his
face
was
clear
and
intellectual
with
keen
kind
eyes
it
had
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
lots
of
pictures
i
had
seen
since
coming
to
the
states
of
the
father
of
his
country
general
washington
he
shook
hands
too
with
me
and
brett
but
first
he
wiped
some
honey
from
his
fingers
on
the
side
of
his
trousers
as
he
did
it
it
was
a
dignified
and
laudable
act
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
have
been
glad
to
see
me
a
perfect
stranger
but
he
seemed
to
be
so
honestly
pleased
that
it
warmed
my
heart
and
made
me
feel
already
at
home
in
the
sweet
old
farmhouse
which
reminded
me
in
its
soft
colours
of
a
great
bunch
of
wall
flowers
i
reckon
we
going
to
be
real
good
friends
said
he
if
we
known
just
how
you
was
coming
jim
i
have
liked
to
meet
you
and
her
little
ladyship
the
first
ladyship
we
had
in
these
parts
you
did
give
us
any
idea
though
and
now
i
see
why
but
look
here
mother
you
might
have
had
the
front
door
open
i
afraid
the
young
lady
from
england
will
think
we
mighty
informal
i
should
wonder
if
that
just
about
what
she
like
to
think
father
said
trowbridge
with
her
smile
that
was
so
motherly
and
friendly
at
the
same
time
miss
woodburn
would
have
been
over
to
see
you
if
she
could
she
was
just
ready
to
jump
for
joy
when
patty
ran
across
to
tell
her
you
were
coming
but
mis
randal
is
pretty
sick
and
sally
felt
she
could
leave
her
yet
awhile
so
she
sent
you
her
love
and
she
be
along
the
minute
she
can
git
away
just
for
an
instant
it
struck
me
as
odd
to
hear
this
simple
farm
woman
in
her
straight
print
calmly
calling
my
charming
dainty
friend
sally
as
if
there
could
be
no
shadow
of
doubt
in
anyone
mind
of
their
perfect
social
equality
but
in
another
second
i
could
have
boxed
my
own
ears
for
my
denseness
and
snobbish
stupidity
already
even
in
these
few
minutes
i
was
beginning
faintly
to
understand
some
of
the
points
at
which
brett
had
hinted
maybe
you
like
to
go
and
have
a
look
at
your
room
went
on
trowbridge
patty
and
ide
have
picked
you
some
flowers
and
i
hope
you
find
everything
right
oh
mis
trowbridge
do
let
me
take
her
exclaimed
patty
me
too
cried
ide
they
just
like
children
i
guess
we
have
to
humour
them
this
once
laughed
brett
cousin
fanny
when
i
smiled
at
patty
she
cuddled
her
arm
round
me
and
then
ide
promptly
did
the
same
thus
interlaced
the
procession
moved
into
the
house
the
door
of
the
verandah
opens
into
a
cosy
there
is
nothing
which
you
could
point
out
as
pretty
in
the
furnishing
and
decoration
there
is
none
but
the
room
has
a
delicious
welcoming
look
and
makes
you
want
to
live
in
it
there
is
the
queerest
carpet
on
the
floor
with
irregular
stripes
of
different
colours
mingling
indistinctly
with
the
grey
groundwork
and
all
has
faded
into
a
pleasant
indefiniteness
of
tint
there
a
sofa
upholstered
with
black
and
the
springs
have
evidently
been
pressed
by
generations
of
trowbridges
who
have
been
born
and
reared
and
died
in
the
old
valley
farmhouse
the
big
ugly
clock
too
with
the
pendulum
showing
through
a
wreath
of
flowers
on
its
glass
door
has
attained
the
dignity
of
age
and
earned
a
right
to
its
place
on
the
crowded
mantelpiece
by
ticking
out
the
years
for
these
same
generations
there
are
patchwork
cushions
and
others
embroidered
with
worsted
and
beads
on
the
sofa
and
in
the
great
armchair
and
the
two
or
three
chairs
with
rockers
curious
shells
and
wax
flowers
under
a
glass
case
adorn
a
carved
wooden
bracket
and
there
are
family
portraits
enlarged
in
crayons
from
old
photographs
hanging
on
the
wall
between
two
windows
stands
a
secretary
bookcase
with
a
shelf
spread
with
writing
materials
and
files
of
paper
in
the
middle
of
the
room
is
a
round
table
with
a
homemade
cover
scarcely
showing
under
its
great
bowl
of
mixed
country
flowers
and
its
neat
piles
of
books
and
magazines
as
i
went
in
the
sun
blinds
were
bowed
for
the
summer
heat
and
the
room
was
filled
with
a
cool
light
suddenly
i
thought
of
ess
kay
magnificent
palace
in
new
york
with
its
fountain
court
and
splendid
drawing
rooms
i
saw
her
little
cottage
at
newport
and
the
other
cottages
and
castles
i
had
grown
accustomed
to
there
but
somehow
the
startling
contrast
between
these
pictures
and
this
only
made
me
more
content
with
my
present
surroundings
what
a
nice
room
i
exclaimed
to
the
girls
pausing
for
a
glance
around
they
looked
surprised
do
you
think
so
asked
patty
we
were
afraid
maybe
you
would
the
things
you
used
to
must
be
a
good
deal
handsomer
everything
so
old
here
i
love
old
things
said
i
our
house
at
home
is
very
old
and
i
would
have
anything
changed
for
worlds
even
if
it
were
to
be
made
better
why
that
kind
of
the
way
feel
too
exclaimed
patty
giving
my
waist
a
sympathetic
squeeze
i
this
but
ide
does
admire
it
a
little
bit
if
i
was
mis
trowbridge
i
always
sit
in
the
parlour
said
ide
instead
of
keeping
it
shut
up
except
for
best
just
because
trowbridge
ma
did
before
her
it
a
pretty
room
there
a
brussels
carpet
with
roses
on
the
floor
and
a
handsome
suite
of
red
velvet
furniture
and
a
piano
and
a
marble
table
patty
practises
her
music
there
but
aside
from
that
none
of
us
see
the
room
only
to
sweep
and
dust
till
thanksgiving
and
christmas
when
the
relations
come
or
when
mis
trowbridge
has
company
to
tea
in
winter
would
you
like
to
see
it
you
can
if
you
want
i
thanked
her
but
thought
we
had
better
put
off
the
treat
until
another
time
as
we
were
on
our
way
to
my
room
i
was
wondering
how
to
define
the
difference
between
patty
and
ide
i
saw
that
it
was
very
marked
yet
i
did
quite
understand
the
two
girls
appeared
to
be
on
the
same
footing
in
the
house
i
said
to
myself
but
ide
was
far
more
showy
than
patty
seeming
to
put
herself
forward
as
if
she
were
afraid
of
not
being
noticed
and
then
she
was
dressed
so
much
more
elaborately
perhaps
i
thought
patty
was
poor
and
in
a
more
dependent
position
than
ide
the
stairway
very
steep
and
narrow
leads
straight
up
from
the
which
is
apparently
in
the
centre
of
the
house
and
fills
the
place
of
a
hall
there
are
no
balusters
but
a
whitewashed
wall
on
either
side
and
only
one
person
can
go
up
at
a
time
at
the
top
is
a
landing
with
a
bare
painted
floor
and
doors
opening
from
it
one
of
the
doors
is
mine
and
as
they
showed
me
in
i
could
see
that
patty
and
ide
both
waited
breathlessly
for
my
verdict
their
faces
looking
quite
strained
and
anxious
until
i
exclaimed
how
fresh
and
pretty
it
is
here
i
meant
it
too
it
is
a
dear
room
with
something
pathetic
about
its
simple
sweetness
and
the
kind
thought
to
give
me
pleasure
which
shows
in
every
little
innocent
detail
the
floor
is
covered
with
a
white
straw
matting
and
there
are
no
two
pieces
of
furniture
that
match
there
a
wide
wooden
bed
of
no
particular
period
that
i
can
recognise
yet
with
an
air
of
being
and
there
are
stiff
square
shams
to
hide
the
pillows
and
turn
down
over
the
top
of
the
sheet
with
fluted
frills
round
the
edges
there
a
thing
covered
with
a
veneer
of
mahogany
which
i
should
call
a
chest
of
drawers
if
patty
and
ide
had
mentioned
it
as
a
bureau
a
mirror
divided
into
two
halves
hangs
over
it
with
a
white
crocheted
cover
to
protect
the
gilt
frame
from
flies
there
a
crocheted
too
and
in
vases
painted
by
home
talent
bloom
the
sweetest
i
ever
smelled
there
are
little
blue
summer
houses
with
pink
children
and
brown
dogs
in
them
matched
all
wrong
at
the
edges
on
the
wall
paper
there
is
a
and
a
table
with
a
white
cover
and
more
flowers
and
that
all
except
a
basket
and
some
hanging
shelves
but
the
white
muslin
curtains
are
tied
with
blue
ribbons
and
there
a
rug
before
the
bed
and
there
are
little
lace
mats
under
the
vases
the
scent
of
dried
rose
leaves
and
lavender
mingles
with
the
perfume
of
the
pinks
and
some
of
the
summer
house
pagodas
on
the
wall
are
hidden
with
steel
engravings
and
photographs
in
frames
i
did
stop
to
examine
the
pictures
at
first
but
after
patty
and
ide
had
tripped
away
to
see
about
my
dinner
they
said
i
was
attracted
by
a
faded
cabinet
photograph
framed
with
shells
it
was
a
full
length
figure
of
a
young
man
on
horseback
he
was
dressed
something
like
those
splendid
cowboys
they
took
me
to
see
at
earlscourt
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
the
face
was
brett
it
was
so
handsome
and
dashing
i
could
hardly
stop
staring
at
it
while
i
washed
off
the
dust
of
motoring
evidently
the
photograph
in
its
frame
has
been
on
the
wall
a
long
time
i
am
glad
they
happened
to
put
it
in
what
they
call
the
spare
room
so
i
can
look
at
it
whenever
i
like
without
anyone
noticing
xvii
about
cows
and
national
characteristics
when
i
went
downstairs
dinner
was
ready
in
a
cool
shady
with
a
bare
floor
painted
brown
and
a
long
table
down
the
middle
it
was
quite
two
but
it
turned
out
that
the
family
had
had
their
dinner
at
noon
exactly
and
this
was
a
meal
only
for
brett
and
me
with
patty
and
ide
to
bring
us
things
from
the
kitchen
and
wait
upon
us
while
trowbridge
flitted
in
smiling
from
time
to
time
to
ask
how
we
were
getting
along
it
was
she
who
was
cooking
for
us
and
i
felt
quite
distressed
at
the
trouble
i
was
giving
on
such
a
hot
day
too
but
she
said
she
was
enjoying
it
it
was
a
very
funny
dinner
according
to
my
ideas
for
i
never
had
a
meal
a
bit
like
it
at
home
even
when
i
was
small
and
dined
in
the
daytime
with
the
governess
but
it
was
tremendously
good
though
none
of
the
things
went
together
properly
we
had
delicious
young
chicken
quite
babies
they
were
poor
dears
fried
with
cream
and
wreathed
all
round
our
plates
in
a
semicircle
were
a
quantity
of
tiny
dishes
each
one
had
a
big
dab
of
something
different
in
it
mashed
potatoes
succotash
green
peas
a
kind
of
vegetable
marrow
to
which
they
gave
the
unworthy
name
of
squash
raw
tomatoes
sweet
green
pickles
preserved
strawberries
and
goodness
knows
what
all
besides
while
if
we
stopped
eating
to
breathe
or
speak
patty
flew
in
with
a
plate
of
things
of
the
most
heavenly
nature
called
corn
fritters
trowbridge
beamed
all
over
when
i
said
i
should
like
to
live
on
them
for
a
month
to
drink
we
had
tumblers
of
iced
tea
and
there
was
raspberry
vinegar
too
which
we
were
supposed
to
swallow
with
our
dinner
and
afterwards
there
was
hot
apple
pie
with
custard
and
slabs
of
cheese
to
eat
at
the
same
time
we
were
obliged
to
eat
a
good
deal
of
everything
otherwise
trowbridge
would
have
felt
hurt
and
i
felt
sleepy
when
we
had
finished
but
i
refused
to
go
and
lie
down
to
rest
as
they
wanted
me
to
it
seemed
such
a
waste
of
time
at
last
trowbridge
offered
to
show
cousin
jim
round
the
farm
and
maybe
i
looked
wistful
for
when
they
found
that
i
was
determined
not
to
take
a
nap
they
asked
if
i
would
go
with
them
trowbridge
had
on
a
linen
coat
now
a
long
yellow
one
which
i
should
laugh
at
if
i
saw
it
on
the
stage
in
a
play
but
it
suited
him
and
he
looked
quite
impressive
in
it
he
fanned
himself
with
a
large
straw
hat
without
any
ribbon
and
talked
splendidly
to
us
as
we
three
walked
together
under
the
trees
if
any
english
person
should
write
a
novel
and
make
a
farmer
in
it
talk
like
trowbridge
everyone
who
read
the
book
would
say
he
was
impossible
his
way
of
speaking
was
a
little
slipshod
sometimes
though
not
a
bit
more
than
ours
when
we
drop
our
g
and
things
like
that
only
more
guileless
sounding
but
without
seeming
a
bit
as
if
he
wanted
to
show
off
what
he
knew
which
is
so
boring
he
quoted
shakespeare
and
wordsworth
and
tennyson
and
in
mentioning
his
work
at
the
hives
in
the
morning
asked
if
we
had
read
mæterlinck
life
of
the
bee
from
that
he
fell
to
discussing
other
things
of
with
brett
and
incidentally
talked
of
ibsen
there
was
the
least
affectation
about
it
all
the
quotations
and
allusions
he
made
were
mixed
up
incidentally
with
conversation
about
the
beauty
of
the
country
and
life
on
a
farm
he
was
interested
in
the
subjects
and
took
it
for
granted
that
we
were
so
he
chatted
about
things
he
cared
for
modestly
and
happily
by
and
by
he
left
us
alone
for
a
few
minutes
while
he
went
to
speak
to
a
man
who
works
on
the
farm
he
was
going
to
show
us
the
maple
sugar
camp
when
he
came
back
and
we
sat
on
a
felled
oak
and
waited
with
a
smell
of
clover
coming
to
us
on
the
warm
breeze
and
the
tinkle
tankle
of
in
the
distance
what
an
extraordinary
man
i
said
to
brett
you
mean
because
he
a
farmer
said
he
his
eyes
laughing
well
i
suppose
i
do
but
then
of
course
he
a
gentleman
farmer
not
an
ordinary
one
at
all
he
a
gentleman
in
the
way
that
all
the
good
people
in
the
country
round
are
gentlefolk
because
they
and
and
intelligent
but
he
comes
of
generations
of
workers
they
make
no
pretensions
to
blue
blood
though
perhaps
they
may
have
some
in
their
veins
and
do
think
themselves
superior
socially
to
their
own
farm
hands
like
that
one
over
there
nor
do
they
consider
themselves
inferior
to
anybody
not
that
they
would
think
of
their
claims
to
equality
with
your
friend
for
instance
they
simply
take
it
for
granted
that
they
are
the
equals
of
any
other
american
or
for
the
matter
of
that
persons
of
any
foreign
nations
you
will
perhaps
hear
them
talking
about
your
king
and
queen
as
and
but
they
wo
mean
the
slightest
disrespect
you
need
be
afraid
i
shall
misunderstand
anything
they
may
do
or
say
said
i
my
ideas
about
them
are
beginning
to
crystallise
already
as
you
thought
they
would
but
i
wondering
at
them
all
still
they
so
utterly
new
to
me
so
absolutely
different
from
any
types
we
have
or
could
have
at
home
what
would
your
mother
the
duchess
think
of
them
now
honour
bright
do
dream
you
hurt
my
feelings
because
they
my
cousins
and
we
come
of
the
same
stock
i
thought
for
a
minute
and
then
i
said
mother
would
begin
to
patronise
them
graciously
at
first
as
if
they
could
be
classified
with
our
farmers
i
mean
the
peasant
ones
not
the
or
kind
when
she
found
she
could
she
would
be
inclined
to
resent
it
then
at
last
when
a
dim
puzzled
inkling
of
the
truth
came
into
her
head
and
she
found
out
that
they
knew
as
much
as
she
about
books
and
politics
and
all
sorts
of
things
oh
i
can
hardly
fancy
exactly
what
she
would
feel
but
trust
and
trowbridge
or
anyone
like
them
not
to
appear
at
a
disadvantage
with
her
whatever
she
did
with
them
they
would
have
enough
to
be
overawed
by
her
though
she
can
be
so
dreadfully
alarming
why
brett
in
a
way
i
believe
they
like
more
like
us
really
deep
down
and
far
back
than
a
good
many
enormously
rich
people
i
met
at
newport
who
think
no
end
of
themselves
and
live
in
palaces
and
know
royalties
abroad
just
as
i
said
once
to
sally
miss
woodburn
take
ourselves
for
granted
and
then
make
any
more
fuss
or
bother
about
our
manners
or
whether
we
going
to
do
the
right
thing
or
not
but
a
few
of
the
people
even
in
your
four
hundred
do
seem
quite
easy
in
their
minds
about
themselves
never
seen
anything
in
big
houses
at
home
where
i
been
with
mother
or
vic
to
come
near
the
luxury
of
theirs
yet
several
i
met
seem
to
relax
and
look
thoroughly
comfortable
as
if
they
really
liked
it
they
do
loll
about
as
we
do
they
only
pretend
to
loll
because
it
in
their
part
in
the
play
they
acting
oh
such
a
smart
society
kind
of
play
with
lots
of
changes
of
dress
and
scene
in
every
act
they
build
castles
because
it
the
smartest
thing
they
can
do
and
because
grand
people
always
did
it
a
long
time
ago
of
course
in
old
times
you
had
to
live
in
them
and
could
have
nice
seaside
cottages
with
balconies
because
if
you
did
your
enemies
shot
off
your
head
or
poured
boiling
oil
on
you
but
nowadays
they
merely
say
horrid
things
behind
your
back
and
it
just
to
build
new
ones
people
talk
about
a
man
being
so
many
millions
as
if
it
matter
what
else
he
worth
and
they
seem
to
be
worrying
a
lot
about
themselves
now
i
ca
imagine
your
cousins
doing
that
they
just
take
themselves
for
granted
as
we
do
in
england
their
behaviour
is
like
the
air
they
breathe
and
as
much
a
part
of
themselves
as
that
air
is
when
it
in
their
lungs
there
a
kind
of
invisible
bond
between
our
kind
of
people
at
home
and
people
like
these
i
think
if
you
come
to
study
it
partly
it
from
having
all
one
natural
interests
in
the
country
maybe
and
not
just
going
into
the
country
from
a
town
to
play
they
are
real
there
nothing
artificial
about
them
you
got
hold
of
things
even
sooner
than
i
thought
you
would
lady
betty
said
brett
when
i
stopped
horrified
at
myself
for
my
long
harangue
in
which
i
been
thinking
out
things
as
i
went
on
but
all
the
same
though
these
new
types
and
this
pleasant
ohio
farm
interest
you
now
you
know
you
rather
die
than
be
doomed
to
live
among
such
people
and
in
such
a
place
perhaps
i
should
be
bored
after
a
while
but
i
do
feel
now
as
if
i
should
i
know
i
could
be
happy
if
i
had
people
with
me
whom
i
loved
but
could
you
love
anyone
who
well
i
got
rid
of
that
fellow
said
trowbridge
cheerfully
now
we
have
a
look
around
the
camp
and
i
show
you
how
we
tap
the
maple
trees
for
the
sap
then
afterwards
we
go
into
the
sugar
house
where
we
boil
it
down
and
make
the
maple
syrup
we
been
talking
so
earnestly
that
we
had
heard
him
come
up
and
i
felt
quite
dazed
for
a
minute
he
explained
everything
to
us
or
rather
to
me
for
brett
knew
all
about
it
beforehand
then
we
had
a
long
walk
over
the
hills
which
are
billowy
and
wooded
like
surrey
and
when
we
came
back
trowbridge
took
me
to
the
beehives
to
get
some
honey
and
show
me
what
a
queen
bee
is
like
he
gave
me
a
hat
with
a
veil
and
put
on
one
himself
then
he
opened
a
hive
and
when
i
was
a
bit
nervous
because
i
trusted
him
he
said
i
tell
you
what
it
is
lady
betty
you
a
trump
i
should
be
surprised
if
there
is
something
in
blood
after
all
illustration
trowbridge
took
me
to
the
beehives
to
get
some
honey
and
show
me
what
a
queen
bee
is
i
was
pleased
for
i
do
think
that
he
or
any
of
the
others
at
the
valley
farm
are
the
kind
to
say
nice
things
to
you
unless
they
really
mean
them
after
we
had
done
all
this
it
was
past
five
and
i
was
longing
for
tea
we
shall
have
it
soon
now
i
said
to
myself
as
we
sat
on
the
side
verandah
on
benches
and
fanning
ourselves
with
fans
trowbridge
and
the
girls
had
changed
their
dresses
while
we
were
away
and
put
on
white
ones
fresh
and
nice
though
the
plainest
of
the
plain
except
ide
who
had
a
pink
alsatian
bow
in
her
hair
and
a
flowered
sash
i
think
they
must
have
washed
their
faces
with
yellow
kitchen
soap
too
for
they
were
so
incredibly
clean
and
polished
that
the
green
of
the
waving
trees
seemed
to
be
reflected
in
their
complexion
in
little
sheens
and
shimmers
i
do
suppose
it
would
have
occurred
to
them
to
dust
off
the
shine
with
powder
as
trowbridge
and
pretty
patty
seem
to
have
no
vanity
or
perhaps
they
would
consider
it
wicked
they
all
sat
and
rocked
but
nobody
said
anything
about
tea
they
do
have
it
late
i
thought
suddenly
ide
exclaimed
my
how
thirsty
i
am
and
she
got
up
oh
joy
i
said
to
myself
i
guess
i
go
and
get
a
drink
of
water
from
the
mineral
spring
she
went
on
and
then
catching
my
yearning
eye
she
asked
if
i
would
like
to
go
too
when
your
whole
soul
is
sighing
for
tea
cold
water
does
seem
a
poor
substitute
but
i
began
to
lose
hope
now
so
i
followed
her
the
water
which
we
got
at
a
spring
in
the
deep
grass
and
drank
out
of
a
tin
dipper
was
deliciously
cold
more
refreshing
than
iced
water
and
did
make
you
thirstier
than
ever
again
in
half
a
second
still
i
could
tear
my
thoughts
from
tea
and
when
we
got
back
to
the
house
i
was
encouraged
to
find
that
trowbridge
and
patty
had
disappeared
i
must
go
and
help
them
get
tea
said
ide
if
you
excuse
me
i
said
of
course
with
alacrity
and
hoped
soon
to
see
a
tray
coming
out
into
the
verandah
where
it
was
so
cool
and
breezy
now
half
an
hour
passed
however
and
nothing
happened
it
was
getting
on
towards
six
and
a
smell
of
frying
floated
to
us
from
the
kitchen
i
suppose
they
beginning
to
cook
something
that
takes
a
long
time
to
do
for
dinner
or
supper
rather
i
thought
she
they
were
getting
tea
so
tea
ready
good
people
if
you
ready
for
it
announced
trowbridge
gentle
voice
at
the
door
trowbridge
and
brett
got
up
and
i
did
too
disappointed
that
we
were
to
have
it
out
of
doors
but
still
i
reminded
myself
the
sitting
room
would
be
nice
and
cool
but
i
found
that
we
were
being
led
through
to
the
dining
room
there
was
the
long
table
laid
out
again
with
a
regular
meal
cream
cheese
and
cake
and
blackberries
and
a
big
plate
of
honey
some
curious
kind
of
smoked
meat
cut
very
thin
and
the
potatoes
which
i
smelled
frying
what
an
odd
tea
i
thought
but
the
oddest
part
was
that
after
all
there
any
tea
we
sat
down
and
at
the
far
end
of
the
table
were
two
young
men
all
soapy
and
sleek
their
hair
very
wet
and
their
sleeves
with
no
cuffs
showing
very
short
we
were
introduced
to
each
other
and
they
bowed
rather
awkwardly
without
saying
anything
but
i
could
understand
their
names
one
of
the
two
never
spoke
and
ate
with
his
knife
until
he
saw
me
looking
when
he
stopped
and
got
red
after
that
he
cut
up
everything
on
his
plate
quite
small
before
he
ate
it
and
stuck
out
his
elbows
the
other
who
sat
next
to
ide
talked
to
her
in
a
low
voice
but
i
caught
the
words
picnic
and
beaux
and
they
both
giggled
a
great
deal
instead
of
tea
those
who
liked
had
black
coffee
with
thick
cream
and
the
others
drank
what
i
should
call
but
they
all
spoke
of
it
as
lemonade
it
was
much
past
six
when
we
finished
and
soon
brett
asked
me
how
i
would
like
to
walk
over
to
randal
and
see
my
friend
miss
woodburn
since
she
could
come
to
me
the
place
was
less
than
a
mile
away
by
short
cuts
which
he
knew
and
he
would
take
me
there
the
shadows
were
beginning
to
grow
long
and
thin
when
we
started
though
the
sun
was
still
bright
so
i
carried
a
sunshade
and
went
hatless
american
fashion
to
avoid
going
out
in
the
road
we
took
field
paths
and
skirted
along
the
edge
of
meadows
where
grain
was
tall
and
golden
or
white
as
a
summer
snowstorm
there
were
no
proper
stiles
as
with
us
so
whenever
we
came
to
one
of
the
rough
fences
which
divided
one
field
from
another
i
had
to
mount
on
the
first
or
second
bar
and
let
brett
lift
me
over
he
is
so
strong
that
he
did
it
as
if
i
were
a
bundle
of
down
instead
of
a
tall
girl
and
i
had
much
the
same
exhilarating
sensation
i
used
to
have
as
a
wee
thing
when
i
rode
wildly
on
mohunsleigh
foot
i
was
glad
when
we
came
to
the
fences
and
that
there
were
a
good
many
of
them
but
i
was
at
all
glad
when
brett
jumped
me
over
into
a
grass
meadow
where
there
was
a
whole
drove
of
black
and
white
cattle
we
go
some
other
way
round
i
asked
longing
to
get
behind
him
but
ashamed
for
him
to
see
what
an
idiot
i
am
about
cows
and
perhaps
make
him
lose
his
good
opinion
of
me
as
a
reasonably
brave
girl
i
afraid
not
unless
we
turn
back
said
he
but
you
need
mind
them
remember
you
with
an
old
puncher
oh
were
you
one
too
i
asked
trying
to
seem
at
ease
too
i
was
thinking
of
a
friend
of
my
cousin
mohunsleigh
whom
he
was
always
talking
about
a
harborough
who
lives
in
san
francisco
mohunsleigh
knew
him
abroad
somewhere
used
to
be
a
puncher
whatever
that
is
in
texas
i
believe
though
now
he
a
millionaire
did
you
ever
hear
of
him
yes
said
brett
in
rather
a
dry
way
i
was
so
disappointed
not
to
meet
him
as
we
walked
on
i
kept
my
eyes
on
the
horrible
animals
who
were
grazing
at
some
distance
why
he
asked
the
question
almost
sharply
because
my
cousin
says
he
such
a
glorious
person
well
gilded
anyhow
oh
i
do
mean
on
that
account
i
rather
blasé
of
millionaires
lately
but
from
mohunsleigh
accounts
he
must
be
well
the
sort
of
a
man
we
like
we
girls
brave
and
adventurous
and
reckless
and
that
sort
of
thing
i
afraid
his
millions
are
more
of
an
attraction
to
most
girls
why
you
as
bad
as
he
i
exclaimed
in
what
way
unjust
and
almost
morbid
i
would
have
thought
would
be
like
that
though
perhaps
one
ca
blame
him
so
much
if
he
had
bad
experiences
i
sorry
for
him
it
must
be
miserable
to
fancy
always
that
people
care
for
you
for
your
money
i
sorry
for
him
too
at
least
i
used
to
be
whenever
i
thought
of
him
are
you
now
no
i
believe
he
a
changed
man
he
found
that
there
are
exceptions
to
the
gloomy
rule
he
laid
down
for
humanity
oh
then
he
happier
so
far
as
i
understand
the
case
he
is
exactly
happy
yet
he
out
of
the
woods
in
fact
he
in
the
thickest
part
but
he
sees
blue
sky
and
the
sun
shining
overhead
what
do
you
mean
a
fellow
who
knows
him
very
well
told
me
that
harborough
had
fallen
in
love
with
a
beautiful
girl
who
was
so
unworldly
that
she
might
be
induced
to
marry
for
love
if
she
cared
then
why
is
he
happy
because
he
does
know
whether
she
can
ever
care
for
him
except
as
a
friend
he
sure
she
likes
him
pretty
well
but
there
nothing
in
that
i
mighty
ignorant
about
such
things
myself
but
they
say
if
a
girl
does
mind
showing
that
she
your
friend
and
values
you
in
a
way
it
a
sign
she
a
thousand
miles
off
from
falling
in
love
with
you
what
your
opinion
on
the
subject
as
you
seem
to
be
rather
interested
in
harborough
my
goodness
brett
there
a
cow
looking
at
us
oh
what
we
do
it
the
worst
cow
of
all
it
putting
its
head
down
now
it
does
like
us
oh
what
an
appalling
beast
i
believe
it
must
be
a
bull
it
a
very
young
one
said
he
calmly
now
do
be
frightened
this
is
going
to
be
nothing
at
all
are
you
ca
you
trust
me
yes
i
know
you
wo
let
me
be
hurt
but
you
do
worry
perhaps
we
shall
have
a
little
fun
just
wait
i
could
cheerfully
have
waited
a
hundred
years
and
then
put
it
off
again
but
it
did
look
as
if
we
should
have
to
wait
long
not
more
than
of
a
dreadful
second
with
my
blood
in
my
head
and
all
the
iced
water
i
had
drunk
at
newport
in
my
spine
the
cows
were
delighted
evidently
they
regarded
the
horrid
brute
as
their
champion
they
did
follow
him
towards
us
but
lifted
their
heads
and
stared
complacently
as
much
as
to
say
is
he
a
splendid
fellow
he
going
to
give
them
what
they
deserve
the
rest
happened
so
quickly
it
was
all
in
a
jumble
with
a
smile
brett
reached
out
and
took
my
sunshade
which
i
closed
just
as
the
bull
came
at
us
he
opened
it
in
the
creature
face
the
bull
swerved
a
few
inches
surprised
and
the
next
thing
i
knew
the
sunshade
was
tossed
away
brett
had
seized
the
animal
by
his
horns
and
was
vaulting
on
his
back
with
a
laugh
run
to
the
nearest
fence
said
he
he
did
it
as
easily
as
if
it
were
play
and
so
it
seemed
to
be
for
him
the
bull
tore
about
ramping
and
raving
while
i
obediently
flew
for
the
fence
and
scrambled
over
without
ceremony
there
i
turned
panting
frightened
yet
laughing
in
spite
of
myself
brett
hat
had
fallen
off
and
his
short
hair
was
ruffled
across
his
forehead
riding
the
black
and
white
bull
hanging
on
by
legs
as
well
as
arms
he
looked
like
a
runaway
schoolboy
revelling
in
a
mischievous
lark
his
eyes
sparkled
and
his
white
teeth
shone
the
bull
was
sure
he
could
throw
his
rider
at
first
but
finding
he
could
was
very
much
surprised
his
wild
gallop
subsided
to
a
trot
and
embracing
his
great
neck
brett
bent
far
down
to
one
side
to
snatch
up
my
sunshade
which
lay
on
the
grass
open
and
undamaged
a
few
moment
later
he
had
steered
the
bull
in
some
curious
way
with
his
feet
so
that
the
beast
came
loping
stupidly
near
the
fence
then
brett
jumped
off
and
vaulted
over
that
was
a
good
bit
of
sport
said
he
it
reminds
me
of
old
times
when
we
chaps
used
to
ride
steers
for
a
wager
i
a
little
out
of
practice
now
but
i
hope
you
were
amused
i
was
much
too
terrified
i
said
thankful
that
he
was
on
the
right
side
of
the
fence
at
last
then
i
apologise
for
the
exhibition
the
silly
brute
did
know
he
was
bull
you
see
but
i
reckon
he
remember
now
and
act
accordingly
here
your
parasol
lady
betty
i
do
think
it
hurt
as
for
my
hat
i
make
the
cows
a
present
of
it
i
do
want
to
keep
you
waiting
any
longer
fancy
daniel
when
he
got
safely
out
of
the
lions
den
going
back
for
his
hat
i
exclaimed
he
was
just
the
sort
of
man
to
have
done
it
said
brett
if
he
had
a
lady
waiting
after
that
nothing
else
happened
to
upset
us
on
the
way
to
sally
the
place
where
she
is
staying
is
a
farm
but
quite
a
small
cottage
in
a
lovely
garden
walled
in
with
oaks
and
maples
and
randal
sells
seeds
and
cuttings
a
young
girl
came
to
the
door
when
we
rang
and
asked
us
to
please
sit
down
on
the
piazza
she
would
call
miss
woodburn
then
we
had
a
few
minutes
to
wait
and
sally
appeared
i
glad
to
see
her
and
when
she
held
me
tight
and
kissed
me
i
had
to
wink
back
some
silly
tears
it
was
so
good
to
feel
that
she
cared
about
me
and
would
sympathise
in
everything
for
i
knew
she
would
after
brett
had
said
how
do
you
do
and
a
few
polite
words
he
added
that
he
would
just
stroll
over
to
the
green
dairy
farm
across
the
way
he
knew
the
farmer
there
and
would
like
to
have
a
chat
with
him
we
settled
that
he
was
to
come
back
for
me
in
an
hour
and
then
sally
and
i
were
left
alone
together
she
made
me
begin
at
the
beginning
and
tell
all
my
adventures
cause
as
well
as
effect
before
she
would
give
me
any
of
her
news
or
even
her
opinions
on
the
situation
as
far
as
it
concerned
me
it
made
quite
a
long
story
and
sally
was
a
beautiful
listener
as
only
sympathetic
and
unselfish
people
can
be
there
was
anything
else
for
me
to
do
was
there
i
asked
when
she
knew
everything
exactly
as
it
had
happened
she
complimented
me
on
my
pluck
like
the
dear
creature
she
is
and
said
she
had
it
in
her
heart
to
be
sorry
as
things
had
turned
out
that
i
had
had
such
a
chase
to
find
her
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
your
affairs
that
drove
me
to
chicago
she
went
on
i
do
mind
your
knowing
now
deah
we
can
talk
freely
about
things
i
could
discuss
with
you
before
of
course
i
always
knew
katherine
wanted
you
for
potter
and
that
they
both
do
anything
to
get
you
it
began
with
her
trying
to
keep
other
men
away
from
you
even
on
the
ship
do
you
remember
nobody
could
get
near
you
but
tom
doremus
and
he
would
if
kath
had
been
afraid
of
van
der
windt
it
was
just
the
same
in
newport
whenever
she
could
fix
it
so
i
could
exactly
warn
you
it
would
have
been
nice
they
my
cousins
and
i
was
kath
guest
though
i
should
have
been
for
long
if
i
had
wanted
to
watch
over
you
but
you
know
i
did
drop
hints
sometimes
did
i
it
was
my
business
if
you
fallen
in
love
with
potter
but
though
he
is
a
bad
fellow
he
not
good
enough
or
strong
enough
for
you
betty
and
i
should
have
been
mighty
sick
at
heart
if
he
had
got
you
i
never
felt
he
wanted
me
really
i
said
although
he
was
always
proposing
oh
yes
he
did
want
you
perhaps
he
was
truly
in
love
at
first
though
he
always
admired
you
deah
there
was
an
actress
that
he
was
crazy
about
last
winter
a
nice
girl
too
and
he
would
have
married
her
if
it
had
been
for
katherine
who
was
over
it
said
such
a
mésalliance
in
the
family
would
ruin
her
as
well
as
him
and
contrived
to
break
it
off
somehow
potter
never
cared
for
anyone
else
so
much
the
girl
seemed
to
understand
his
temper
exactly
and
though
he
was
heart
and
soul
for
winning
you
after
the
race
was
begun
i
should
wonder
a
bit
now
he
lost
you
if
that
affair
did
come
on
again
some
day
he
might
do
worse
i
wish
the
girl
joy
of
him
said
i
but
how
was
it
you
went
away
from
newport
oh
i
told
kath
what
i
thought
of
her
for
trying
to
trap
you
it
that
and
nothing
else
and
she
did
like
it
she
almost
asked
me
to
go
and
though
i
knew
it
was
to
get
me
out
of
the
way
i
had
to
do
it
i
wish
you
could
have
met
hale
in
chicago
she
is
the
nicest
quaintest
woman
you
saw
her
happy
family
well
she
so
that
when
her
horses
are
out
at
grass
she
has
a
big
sunbonnet
made
for
each
one
you
would
laugh
to
see
them
prancing
about
with
their
bonnets
flapping
and
she
stops
cab
horses
in
the
street
to
give
them
sugar
but
after
all
it
better
for
you
to
be
here
with
the
trowbridges
brett
has
been
a
saint
to
me
said
sally
smiled
her
smile
i
think
from
what
you
tell
me
of
some
of
the
things
you
said
to
him
and
some
of
the
things
which
have
happened
that
he
been
a
saint
more
of
a
saint
than
you
know
you
mean
i
tried
his
temper
i
asked
anxiously
not
exactly
his
temper
but
never
mind
i
talk
to
you
about
myself
now
so
she
did
and
it
seems
that
this
invalid
widow
randal
whom
she
come
to
nurse
is
the
mother
of
the
man
she
told
me
about
in
the
park
the
man
who
turned
monk
because
he
loved
her
and
thought
she
did
care
i
come
once
or
twice
a
year
even
when
she
well
said
sally
with
the
soft
voice
and
eyes
which
she
has
for
this
one
subject
of
all
in
the
world
it
the
best
of
the
few
pleasures
i
have
to
be
with
her
and
talk
of
him
of
him
when
he
was
a
little
boy
of
him
when
he
was
a
young
man
happy
in
the
thought
of
the
future
not
knowing
what
was
to
come
i
found
this
little
place
for
her
years
ago
now
she
happy
in
kentucky
for
there
were
relatives
there
who
were
not
congenial
and
used
to
say
things
of
her
son
religion
which
distressed
her
but
she
is
old
now
and
very
delicate
she
knows
i
would
never
forgive
her
if
she
did
have
her
little
maid
telegraph
for
me
when
she
is
suffering
i
always
come
at
once
and
would
no
matter
where
i
was
you
see
i
no
mother
of
my
own
and
she
is
mother
it
almost
the
same
as
if
she
were
mine
but
do
look
so
sad
dear
i
not
sad
she
going
to
get
well
we
been
glancing
over
old
photographs
of
his
this
evening
she
has
quite
forgiven
me
for
the
past
i
should
think
so
i
could
help
exclaiming
you
were
the
one
who
suffered
most
not
more
than
his
mother
child
but
she
old
as
i
said
and
thank
heaven
i
beginning
to
grow
old
too
each
day
is
one
less
before
we
meet
he
and
i
that
what
i
looking
forward
to
now
and
i
not
a
bit
sad
so
kiss
me
and
tell
me
just
what
you
think
of
those
dear
things
the
trowbridges
going
home
brett
and
i
walked
along
the
road
until
we
passed
the
cow
meadow
then
we
took
to
the
short
cuts
again
a
lovely
blue
darkness
was
just
touched
with
the
faint
radiance
of
a
new
moon
as
if
the
lid
of
a
box
had
snapped
shut
on
the
sun
and
the
moment
the
light
was
gone
the
fields
lit
up
with
thousands
and
thousands
of
tiny
pulsing
flitting
sparks
what
it
i
asked
astonished
fireflies
said
he
did
you
never
see
any
before
never
how
wonderful
they
are
the
most
exquisite
magical
little
things
then
i
glad
you
seeing
them
for
the
first
time
with
me
he
said
i
stopped
and
made
him
stop
to
look
at
the
enchanted
rain
of
tiny
lights
we
stood
in
a
billowy
meadow
with
the
pale
of
the
stacked
oats
dimly
silvered
by
the
baby
moon
that
was
hurrying
down
the
west
after
the
sun
the
bundles
of
grain
made
pointed
gothic
arches
and
through
these
back
and
forth
in
and
out
threaded
the
fireflies
like
fairies
with
lanterns
searching
for
lost
members
of
their
band
what
a
pity
they
never
come
to
england
to
search
when
we
got
home
the
stars
were
pricking
out
in
the
sky
and
patty
and
ide
were
down
by
the
gate
counting
them
it
seems
if
you
can
count
seven
stars
for
seven
nights
then
the
first
man
who
touches
your
hand
afterwards
you
bound
to
marry
i
counted
my
first
seven
and
i
do
hope
it
wo
rain
for
a
week
although
i
had
been
so
longing
for
tea
i
had
been
hungry
and
had
scarcely
eaten
anything
when
we
had
it
now
i
was
beginning
to
be
starved
we
all
sat
on
the
verandah
and
trowbridge
told
us
things
about
astronomy
in
which
he
seems
as
learned
as
in
everything
else
it
was
ten
and
trowbridge
asked
if
i
tired
and
would
like
to
go
to
bed
then
i
knew
the
worst
there
was
going
to
be
any
supper
we
all
bade
each
other
what
time
is
breakfast
i
asked
trowbridge
expecting
something
abnormal
in
the
way
of
earliness
but
my
eyes
did
open
when
she
said
six
you
do
need
to
get
up
unless
you
want
she
went
on
patty
or
ide
will
carry
you
up
something
i
would
hear
of
that
though
i
said
i
would
prefer
to
do
what
everybody
else
did
and
i
saw
that
this
pleased
trowbridge
who
had
perhaps
feared
i
would
show
symptoms
of
the
pampered
aristocrat
but
he
little
knows
what
small
pampering
i
get
at
home
i
stood
at
my
window
watching
the
fireflies
and
envying
them
because
they
could
get
their
own
supper
just
then
among
the
trees
there
was
a
bigger
yellower
light
than
their
tiny
lanterns
a
faint
smell
of
good
tobacco
smoke
came
up
lady
betty
is
that
you
asked
brett
voice
yes
i
answered
pushing
up
the
frame
with
the
mosquito
netting
and
leaning
over
the
window
sill
i
got
something
for
you
have
you
a
box
or
basket
you
can
let
down
with
string
if
i
toss
a
ball
of
it
up
to
you
there
a
small
basket
i
said
quite
excited
he
tossed
and
i
caught
stan
taught
me
how
long
ago
then
i
made
the
basket
ready
and
sent
it
down
now
he
called
after
a
minute
i
hauled
the
basket
up
carefully
said
he
there
a
note
in
it
among
other
things
now
pull
down
your
mosquito
net
or
you
have
trouble
it
was
fun
opening
the
basket
there
were
two
chicken
sandwiches
in
it
in
a
napkin
a
piece
of
jelly
cake
a
peach
and
an
bottle
of
milk
the
note
was
just
a
few
lines
scribbled
with
pencil
on
a
sheet
torn
from
a
memorandum
book
i
been
feeling
wretchedly
guilty
about
you
it
began
almost
as
much
of
a
brute
as
if
you
were
some
innocent
helpless
creature
killed
and
buried
under
the
leaves
in
the
woods
no
tea
this
afternoon
and
you
an
english
girl
when
they
say
here
they
mean
the
evening
meal
the
last
one
i
like
a
beast
did
notice
that
you
ate
nothing
not
that
i
was
thinking
of
you
for
i
was
i
even
have
the
sense
to
realise
that
you
were
being
sent
perishing
to
bed
it
was
patty
who
saw
all
but
was
too
shy
to
speak
to
you
this
humble
offering
is
her
thought
you
sha
be
starved
after
there
was
a
question
of
mine
you
did
answer
this
afternoon
i
got
a
grudge
against
that
black
and
white
steer
i
could
think
what
he
meant
at
first
then
i
remembered
how
he
had
been
asking
my
opinion
about
the
love
affairs
of
millionaire
friend
i
do
see
though
why
he
should
care
so
much
what
i
think
of
them
it
would
be
lots
more
interesting
if
he
would
ask
me
questions
about
himself
xviii
about
some
country
folk
and
walker
emporium
the
day
after
i
came
to
valley
farm
was
one
of
the
longest
days
of
my
life
not
that
it
was
pleasant
for
it
was
but
when
you
get
up
before
six
and
finish
breakfast
at
seven
it
does
give
you
a
good
many
hours
to
do
what
you
like
with
i
was
allowed
to
help
trowbridge
and
the
girls
with
their
work
brett
went
off
directly
after
breakfast
with
trowbridge
and
the
two
mysterious
young
men
to
get
in
hay
or
do
something
useful
and
farmy
so
i
sat
in
the
maple
grove
with
vivace
who
is
a
great
favourite
in
the
household
and
wrote
down
all
my
experiences
since
chicago
we
had
an
enormous
dinner
at
twelve
which
made
me
feel
very
odd
as
i
not
used
to
it
but
when
we
were
called
to
tea
i
knew
better
than
i
did
yesterday
what
to
expect
now
i
been
a
boarder
at
the
trowbridges
i
pay
four
dollars
a
week
about
as
much
i
suppose
as
is
spent
on
one
person
food
at
each
meal
at
ess
kay
for
eight
days
and
i
perfectly
happy
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
the
time
coming
when
i
must
go
home
it
will
come
of
course
for
they
will
have
to
send
for
me
whether
they
really
want
me
back
or
not
and
then
i
will
never
see
any
of
these
dear
people
again
probably
i
shall
never
even
see
brett
he
says
he
must
go
west
again
soon
that
there
are
things
which
call
him
there
that
will
be
the
end
i
wish
one
did
get
to
depend
on
other
people
so
much
i
should
like
to
be
quite
cold
hearted
and
not
care
for
anyone
then
it
would
matter
when
you
had
to
part
but
there
no
use
in
thinking
about
horrid
things
just
yet
i
written
home
of
course
i
wrote
the
day
after
i
arrived
at
first
i
felt
i
ought
to
cable
but
if
i
did
they
might
send
at
once
and
on
second
thoughts
i
decided
it
was
necessary
to
go
to
the
expense
so
i
just
wrote
to
mother
to
say
i
could
stand
it
with
ess
kay
on
account
of
her
brother
and
i
left
suddenly
to
join
sally
woodburn
in
the
country
where
i
was
boarding
quite
close
to
her
i
wrote
to
ess
kay
too
and
said
the
same
thing
asking
her
to
kindly
send
on
my
boxes
i
did
mention
brett
because
she
would
have
remembered
who
he
was
or
if
she
did
by
any
chance
she
would
only
disapprove
of
his
daring
to
exist
still
and
perhaps
write
or
wire
something
rude
she
sent
the
boxes
by
what
they
call
express
but
did
answer
my
letter
which
rather
astonished
me
as
i
had
thought
she
would
scold
and
had
dreaded
it
but
when
i
told
sally
she
was
as
much
surprised
as
i
was
she
knew
already
everything
that
happened
after
i
ran
away
from
the
moorings
and
told
me
all
about
it
which
interested
me
a
great
deal
ess
kay
had
written
her
some
things
and
pitchley
whose
maid
is
an
intimate
friend
of
ess
kay
louise
had
supplied
all
the
missing
details
it
seems
that
the
day
after
the
pink
ball
ess
kay
had
one
of
her
headaches
and
no
wonder
feeling
very
ill
she
did
take
much
interest
in
me
and
took
it
for
granted
when
louise
said
i
was
out
of
my
room
that
i
wanted
to
sleep
till
luncheon
potter
had
been
so
furious
that
he
thought
to
punish
me
for
my
sins
by
sulking
ess
kay
did
not
appear
at
luncheon
and
potter
went
out
somewhere
but
when
i
did
show
myself
or
even
ring
the
servants
began
to
think
it
odd
and
spoke
to
louise
she
knocked
at
my
door
and
when
after
rapping
several
times
there
was
no
answer
she
opened
it
to
find
the
room
empty
the
bed
smooth
my
boxes
packed
and
all
ess
kay
presents
to
me
spread
out
on
a
sofa
by
that
time
it
was
after
two
and
if
only
they
had
known
i
was
leaving
the
to
take
the
train
for
chicago
with
brett
ess
kay
was
so
nervous
with
her
headache
and
the
reaction
after
all
her
work
in
getting
up
the
great
affair
that
when
she
was
told
i
was
nowhere
to
be
found
she
had
hysterics
and
slapped
louise
potter
was
sent
for
to
the
casino
and
came
home
in
a
rage
they
talked
things
over
and
made
up
their
minds
that
i
had
either
caught
a
ship
sailing
for
home
or
else
had
gone
to
chicago
to
join
sally
if
it
had
been
that
they
were
afraid
of
a
scandal
coming
out
in
some
horrid
society
paper
they
would
have
applied
to
the
police
for
help
but
as
it
was
they
did
dare
and
potter
said
he
could
manage
everything
himself
a
ship
really
had
sailed
that
day
so
as
well
as
telegraphing
to
sally
potter
went
to
the
offices
then
to
the
docks
and
made
all
sorts
of
enquiries
from
what
he
heard
about
some
people
who
had
engaged
berths
at
the
last
minute
he
could
be
quite
sure
i
was
one
of
them
having
gone
under
an
assumed
name
to
add
to
the
trouble
no
answer
came
from
sally
hale
according
to
instructions
had
opened
the
telegram
and
knowing
something
of
the
story
from
sally
was
anxious
to
relieve
ess
kay
mind
about
me
in
too
much
of
a
hurry
instead
of
having
the
message
wired
again
she
enclosed
it
in
an
envelope
and
sent
it
on
to
sally
by
post
so
there
was
another
delay
and
they
knew
nothing
for
certain
until
a
letter
from
sally
and
one
from
me
arrived
at
about
the
same
time
sally
opinion
was
and
is
that
ess
kay
has
something
up
her
sleeve
that
she
wo
write
to
me
because
she
wants
to
show
how
hurt
and
scandalised
she
is
by
my
ungracious
conduct
but
that
she
has
some
idea
for
getting
even
with
me
sooner
or
later
if
she
had
that
to
keep
her
up
sally
thinks
she
could
have
resisted
answering
my
letter
with
a
tirade
fortunately
she
ca
claw
me
away
from
the
trowbridges
and
make
me
marry
potter
even
if
he
would
have
me
now
after
all
my
badness
otherwise
she
would
perhaps
have
tried
to
act
at
once
and
she
ca
have
me
put
in
prison
on
bread
and
water
and
solitary
confinement
as
no
doubt
she
would
like
to
do
still
i
feel
quite
easy
in
my
mind
about
her
silence
lest
sally
may
be
right
about
some
disagreeable
plan
she
hatching
however
as
long
as
brett
is
here
i
feel
as
if
he
would
contrive
not
to
let
anything
very
dreadful
happen
to
me
i
found
out
everything
about
all
the
members
of
the
family
at
valley
farm
now
and
i
got
acquainted
with
most
of
the
neighbours
they
call
them
neighbours
if
they
live
anywhere
within
twelve
or
fifteen
miles
and
a
good
many
are
related
to
each
other
or
connected
by
marriage
while
even
those
who
are
not
have
mostly
known
each
other
ever
since
they
were
children
probably
went
to
school
together
at
a
funny
little
wooden
building
on
a
hill
which
is
the
district
school
it
must
be
rather
fun
to
teach
in
it
because
if
some
american
stories
i
read
since
i
came
here
are
true
to
life
you
board
first
at
one
house
and
then
another
giving
good
advice
and
helping
everyone
and
all
the
young
men
in
the
country
round
about
fall
in
love
with
you
i
thought
if
mother
should
be
too
angry
with
me
for
refusing
potter
parker
and
running
away
to
let
me
come
home
again
i
might
apply
for
such
a
situation
but
it
seems
that
nowadays
you
have
to
know
a
great
deal
and
i
should
never
be
taken
on
because
unfortunately
i
have
to
do
the
multiplication
table
on
my
fingers
trowbridge
although
a
farmer
who
works
in
his
own
fields
is
an
honourable
i
was
surprised
when
i
heard
that
as
i
did
suppose
people
had
titles
in
america
but
he
a
senator
or
something
in
his
own
state
which
is
very
important
so
he
is
called
honourable
officially
and
on
letters
as
one
is
at
home
if
that
all
one
can
scrape
up
by
way
of
a
courtesy
title
the
two
young
men
who
come
in
to
eat
with
us
but
are
never
seen
about
the
house
at
any
other
time
are
farm
hands
though
they
are
not
treated
at
all
like
servants
and
trowbridge
lends
them
the
newest
books
and
magazines
of
which
he
has
quantities
to
read
in
the
evening
one
whose
name
is
elisha
was
in
love
with
patty
but
she
did
care
for
him
so
he
is
very
melancholy
and
wo
talk
at
the
table
but
he
has
cheered
up
a
little
lately
and
has
bought
tall
collars
like
brett
instead
of
wearing
ones
which
showed
far
down
his
neck
and
he
has
sent
me
flowers
through
ide
several
times
i
tried
to
thank
him
for
the
first
ones
but
he
blushed
so
much
that
his
forehead
got
damp
and
immediately
afterwards
he
went
away
and
hid
for
hours
which
kept
him
from
his
supper
so
i
thought
it
better
to
say
nothing
about
the
next
the
other
young
man
albert
is
paying
attention
to
ide
nobody
knows
whether
they
are
engaged
yet
although
they
go
to
the
apple
orchard
regularly
every
evening
and
sit
together
in
a
boat
swing
which
is
there
or
if
it
rains
they
sit
on
the
front
porch
until
quite
late
they
do
seem
to
have
much
to
say
to
each
other
though
for
one
of
my
windows
is
directly
over
that
porch
but
i
never
hear
a
sound
not
even
a
laugh
but
it
seems
that
in
this
part
of
the
country
it
is
the
thing
for
a
girl
and
a
young
man
to
be
left
alone
together
as
much
as
possible
while
they
are
making
up
their
minds
whether
or
not
they
like
each
other
well
enough
to
be
engaged
it
is
very
strange
about
patty
and
ide
though
patty
is
so
quiet
almost
meek
in
her
ways
and
dresses
so
plainly
and
is
quite
contented
to
work
in
the
hot
kitchen
cooking
and
washing
dishes
it
turns
out
that
she
is
a
very
rich
girl
or
will
be
she
is
an
orphan
and
her
grandfather
although
a
farmer
has
more
than
a
million
dollars
which
sounds
tremendous
but
would
be
as
impressive
i
suppose
if
one
did
it
in
pounds
and
when
he
dies
as
he
must
before
long
as
he
is
very
old
patty
will
have
all
his
money
young
people
get
on
his
nerves
so
patty
lives
with
the
trowbridges
who
are
friends
of
his
and
helps
trowbridge
with
her
work
she
is
so
pretty
and
has
such
sweet
ways
that
she
might
make
a
success
anywhere
and
it
struck
me
as
a
pity
that
she
should
perhaps
marry
some
young
farmer
in
the
neighbourhood
and
never
know
any
other
life
than
this
i
remarked
something
of
the
sort
to
brett
when
he
told
me
about
patty
and
he
looked
suddenly
miserable
as
if
what
i
said
had
hurt
i
thought
you
felt
you
could
be
happy
among
such
people
as
these
he
answered
rather
irrelevantly
then
i
fancied
that
i
understood
a
little
for
he
seems
to
think
that
is
like
the
men
here
but
he
is
a
bit
oh
not
the
least
bit
in
the
world
though
he
says
he
was
brought
up
on
a
farm
as
a
little
boy
before
he
ran
away
and
went
far
out
west
and
that
it
only
an
accident
of
fate
he
is
an
albert
or
an
elisha
as
if
he
could
ever
have
been
like
one
of
them
i
have
never
known
a
man
as
interesting
as
he
ide
really
a
sort
of
servant
but
she
would
go
away
instantly
if
anybody
called
her
that
and
she
is
so
afraid
someone
may
think
she
is
inferior
to
the
others
in
the
house
because
she
is
paid
wages
for
her
work
that
she
does
her
hair
elaborately
wears
smarter
dresses
than
the
rest
and
puts
herself
rather
forward
with
strangers
so
as
to
impress
them
she
would
even
like
to
be
called
a
help
but
says
that
she
obliges
trowbridge
and
she
would
stop
long
enough
to
draw
another
breath
if
she
were
not
treated
better
if
anything
than
patty
even
in
the
east
in
very
grand
houses
i
thought
some
of
the
servants
were
rather
offhand
and
queer
though
they
did
consent
to
have
their
meals
in
the
servants
hall
or
somewhere
and
not
sit
in
the
drawing
room
i
suppose
the
reason
why
they
are
so
different
with
us
and
so
polite
and
well
trained
is
because
at
home
they
are
willing
to
go
on
being
servants
all
their
lives
whereas
in
america
it
only
a
phase
in
a
person
career
you
may
be
a
parlour
maid
one
year
the
next
you
may
keep
a
hotel
and
the
next
you
may
be
a
millionairess
travelling
in
europe
there
nothing
to
prevent
if
it
in
you
and
naturally
you
always
hope
it
is
the
trowbridges
neighbours
are
almost
as
nice
as
they
are
after
i
had
been
here
two
or
three
days
i
was
feeding
the
chickens
with
trowbridge
after
tea
when
a
man
and
woman
came
up
the
avenue
they
were
countrified
looking
and
rather
awkward
i
thought
at
first
glance
which
was
the
only
one
i
took
as
i
at
once
left
trowbridge
to
talk
with
the
newcomers
and
went
away
it
was
ide
time
yet
to
sit
with
albert
so
i
found
an
apple
and
sat
and
rocked
in
the
boat
swing
with
a
book
i
left
there
earlier
in
the
afternoon
presently
however
down
ran
patty
to
ask
if
i
would
mind
coming
back
to
the
house
as
and
engelhorn
had
come
especially
to
see
me
to
see
me
i
repeated
what
for
oh
i
suppose
they
thought
it
would
be
polite
to
call
said
patty
they
such
nice
people
they
have
the
farm
with
the
low
house
opposite
this
engelhorn
was
a
city
girl
her
father
is
the
best
jeweller
in
arcona
and
her
brother
has
the
biggest
steam
cleaning
establishment
there
she
been
beautifully
educated
and
he
very
intelligent
i
guess
you
like
them
oh
i
come
of
course
i
said
i
did
dream
they
wanted
to
see
me
but
i
would
much
rather
have
stopped
where
i
was
and
read
the
book
of
course
it
only
prejudice
and
the
way
one
has
been
brought
up
which
makes
one
feel
as
if
it
were
odd
to
meet
tradespeople
and
it
nonsense
too
for
as
soon
as
they
get
horribly
rich
nobody
seems
to
mind
nowadays
which
shows
how
little
sense
there
is
in
the
idea
still
i
did
want
to
laugh
though
i
was
ashamed
of
myself
but
a
picture
of
mother
being
called
on
formally
by
a
steam
cleaner
would
come
up
before
me
and
engelhorn
had
put
on
their
best
clothes
and
they
were
dears
i
was
as
agreeable
as
i
knew
how
to
be
and
after
i
had
been
with
them
a
little
while
i
felt
that
it
was
they
who
were
superior
they
talked
about
the
most
interesting
and
learned
things
just
as
trowbridge
does
and
in
the
same
simple
modest
way
we
went
into
the
parlour
where
engelhorn
played
as
well
as
a
professional
and
sang
exquisitely
in
a
cultivated
contralto
voice
i
could
have
cried
to
see
how
her
hands
looked
as
they
flew
so
cleverly
over
the
keys
of
trowbridge
splendid
steinway
grand
piano
which
is
much
finer
and
in
better
condition
than
ours
at
home
after
they
had
gone
trowbridge
told
me
that
engelhorn
is
the
greatest
authority
on
geology
in
the
state
of
ohio
that
he
knows
just
as
much
about
botany
and
is
a
fine
greek
and
latin
scholar
having
picked
up
all
his
knowledge
himself
without
any
university
training
americans
are
wonderful
other
people
just
as
interesting
in
different
ways
have
been
since
and
there
was
only
one
i
did
like
he
came
yesterday
and
is
a
dissenting
parson
a
congregationalist
i
think
though
i
do
know
what
that
means
or
how
it
different
from
a
methodist
or
a
presbyterian
he
and
his
wife
arrived
to
noon
dinner
and
i
had
to
be
civil
because
the
trowbridges
respect
them
very
much
but
it
was
difficult
when
the
man
said
that
england
was
the
most
immoral
and
decaying
country
in
the
world
and
his
wife
echoed
him
he
is
a
smug
old
fellow
with
a
fringe
of
grey
fluff
growing
out
all
round
under
his
chin
and
his
upper
lip
very
long
and
shaved
is
like
the
straight
cover
you
see
on
mantelpieces
in
country
hotels
i
summoned
courage
to
stand
up
for
england
and
the
wife
a
fat
sallow
creature
with
three
chins
and
a
chignon
glared
at
me
as
if
she
expected
white
bears
to
crawl
out
from
under
the
table
and
gobble
me
up
why
do
you
think
england
is
such
a
wicked
country
i
asked
because
to
mention
only
one
reason
as
if
the
others
were
too
bad
to
tell
your
clergymen
are
put
into
their
places
by
patronage
without
any
regard
to
their
qualifications
as
teachers
of
religion
at
least
they
gentlemen
i
snapped
superficially
they
be
he
admitted
as
if
to
pry
under
the
surface
would
be
worse
than
scratching
a
russian
to
find
a
tartar
but
they
are
puppets
and
sycophants
unluckily
i
do
know
what
a
sycophant
is
exactly
so
it
would
have
been
dangerous
to
argue
and
anyway
before
i
could
get
out
another
word
he
had
gone
on
again
panter
and
myself
had
a
chance
to
go
to
great
britain
last
year
he
said
our
congregation
offered
us
the
trip
with
cook
tickets
for
ten
weeks
to
show
their
appreciation
of
my
services
but
after
reflection
we
decided
not
to
undertake
the
tour
i
have
no
wish
to
see
england
as
it
is
such
illusions
as
are
left
to
me
i
would
rather
keep
it
would
depress
me
to
visit
a
country
which
is
going
down
hill
as
britain
is
morally
financially
and
intellectually
trade
is
leaving
her
and
coming
to
us
we
are
getting
her
shipping
we
are
taking
away
her
steel
and
iron
market
for
all
the
world
and
she
deserves
to
have
lost
what
she
is
losing
still
london
must
be
a
sad
sight
to
those
who
have
eyes
to
see
and
i
do
think
you
find
that
grass
has
begun
to
grow
in
bond
street
yet
said
i
and
if
you
fancy
that
our
finances
are
in
such
a
bad
way
you
had
better
read
the
blue
book
i
did
think
this
was
smart
of
me
for
i
hardly
know
the
blue
book
from
a
book
of
beauty
but
i
heard
stan
say
that
you
obliged
to
believe
it
and
that
it
proves
england
to
be
increasing
every
year
in
prosperity
so
i
was
glad
i
remembered
to
speak
of
it
and
catching
brett
eyes
i
saw
such
a
twinkling
smile
in
them
that
i
hurried
to
look
away
or
i
should
have
laughed
and
spoiled
everything
there
could
be
a
greater
contrast
between
two
men
than
between
the
reverend
jonas
panter
and
the
great
whit
walker
of
the
emporium
at
hermann
corners
we
drove
to
walker
after
the
panters
had
gone
as
we
all
felt
though
nobody
put
it
precisely
into
words
that
we
wanted
some
enlivening
we
did
start
until
after
tea
as
the
emporium
is
always
open
till
half
past
nine
and
there
was
going
to
be
an
ice
cream
festival
there
that
night
i
did
know
what
an
ice
cream
festival
meant
but
trowbridge
said
i
should
see
for
myself
and
it
would
probably
be
different
from
anything
i
had
yet
experienced
everybody
from
the
farm
went
except
elisha
who
did
wish
to
as
he
is
not
quite
happy
yet
and
is
practising
the
flute
of
evenings
trowbridge
and
brett
and
i
all
drove
in
the
buggy
it
was
rather
a
squeeze
in
one
seat
but
it
was
fun
and
we
were
very
merry
i
like
buggies
though
they
do
sound
almost
improper
to
an
english
ear
and
it
makes
it
seem
more
amusing
somehow
because
they
talk
about
going
for
a
ride
instead
of
a
drive
the
rest
all
squashed
into
a
big
wagon
and
sat
on
the
hay
i
would
have
gone
in
that
way
too
but
trowbridge
wanted
me
to
try
his
horse
and
we
could
hear
the
others
laughing
every
minute
as
they
came
jolting
on
behind
us
it
was
about
seven
miles
to
hermann
corners
and
after
a
lovely
drive
through
charming
peaceful
country
we
arrived
just
as
it
was
beginning
to
be
dusk
i
could
have
imagined
such
a
place
as
the
emporium
and
when
i
was
in
the
thick
of
it
i
said
to
myself
that
it
would
be
worth
one
while
coming
over
to
the
states
just
to
visit
it
if
nothing
else
if
i
had
to
choose
between
i
believe
i
rather
see
it
than
niagara
falls
for
one
knows
niagara
falls
from
biographs
and
things
and
nothing
short
of
actually
seeing
could
give
one
the
slightest
idea
of
whit
walker
and
his
emporium
my
first
impression
of
the
emporium
was
a
huge
rambling
wooden
building
rather
like
a
vast
barn
with
a
dozen
smaller
barns
tacked
on
to
it
and
windows
let
in
it
is
painted
and
has
a
rough
verandah
running
partly
round
it
a
high
verandah
with
no
steps
or
if
any
at
such
long
intervals
that
you
must
search
for
them
but
as
there
no
pavement
we
just
scrambled
out
of
the
buggy
and
cart
onto
the
verandah
and
there
we
were
landed
among
the
most
extraordinary
collection
of
things
i
ever
dreamed
of
the
stock
in
the
emporium
having
overflowed
from
the
inside
onto
the
verandah
we
stumbled
about
among
boxes
of
eggs
sewing
machines
crates
of
dishes
garden
tools
brooms
rocking
chairs
perambulators
boots
canned
fruit
children
toys
luggage
green
vegetables
ice
cream
freezers
bales
of
calico
men
suits
books
clothes
lines
and
a
thousand
other
goods
a
number
of
young
men
were
sitting
about
on
the
biggest
of
the
boxes
and
on
chicken
coops
wherever
they
could
clear
a
space
and
had
the
air
of
being
in
a
club
our
party
knew
them
almost
all
and
they
exchanged
how
do
you
do
brett
seemed
the
only
stranger
but
as
he
told
me
he
has
often
visited
his
cousins
from
the
open
doors
and
windows
of
the
emporium
streamed
out
the
strangely
mingled
smells
of
all
the
things
in
the
world
which
happened
to
be
missing
on
the
verandah
and
most
of
those
that
were
there
as
a
fragrance
it
was
indescribable
but
it
was
nice
and
rather
exciting
i
do
know
why
unless
there
was
a
quantity
of
spice
in
it
just
as
we
threaded
our
way
through
the
groups
of
young
men
who
looked
at
us
a
good
deal
people
were
lighting
the
gas
in
the
emporium
it
was
incandescent
and
blazed
up
suddenly
with
a
fierce
light
as
if
it
were
a
volcano
having
an
eruption
all
the
women
inside
there
was
quite
a
crowd
of
them
bareheaded
or
in
perfectly
fascinating
frilled
sunbonnets
shrieked
and
then
giggled
a
man
who
was
surrounded
by
girls
said
something
we
could
hear
which
made
everybody
laugh
and
trowbridge
exclaimed
that
whit
sure
holding
court
could
be
anybody
else
and
i
guess
that
the
honourable
said
the
voice
we
had
heard
such
a
nice
voice
it
was
enough
to
make
you
laugh
with
pleasure
just
to
hear
it
and
the
head
we
could
see
towering
over
the
sunbonnets
began
to
move
towards
us
the
girls
edged
away
and
there
was
a
man
almost
as
as
brett
smiling
at
us
and
holding
out
his
big
hand
everything
was
big
about
him
his
voice
his
brown
throat
his
shoulders
and
his
good
white
smile
shining
with
kindness
and
two
rows
of
perfect
teeth
his
nature
too
as
you
could
see
by
his
beaming
humorous
grey
eyes
and
the
generous
dimple
in
his
square
chin
whit
this
is
the
little
english
ladyship
i
told
you
about
staying
over
at
our
house
said
trowbridge
so
we
were
introduced
and
the
great
whit
shook
my
hand
with
a
vigorous
magnetism
which
made
me
feel
i
would
like
to
clap
and
give
him
three
cheers
he
is
the
sort
of
man
i
should
try
to
make
president
of
the
united
states
if
i
were
an
american
and
i
sure
he
would
get
lots
of
votes
from
his
part
of
the
country
if
he
were
nominated
i
real
pleased
to
meet
you
said
he
and
i
honoured
to
have
you
visit
my
store
say
i
guess
some
of
our
american
leading
ladies
will
have
to
get
a
hustle
on
if
they
want
to
save
themselves
now
you
over
here
i
did
know
they
made
like
that
on
your
side
i
tell
you
what
it
is
honourable
i
wo
have
much
use
for
some
of
our
fellows
if
they
let
her
go
back
eh
now
you
just
tell
me
what
handle
i
to
put
to
your
name
so
i
wo
make
any
fool
mistake
and
then
we
can
get
ahead
like
a
house
on
fire
i
usually
called
lady
betty
i
said
feeling
an
idiot
as
everyone
was
standing
round
in
a
ring
what
at
the
first
go
no
i
could
do
it
i
have
got
the
cool
ingrowing
nerve
could
i
make
it
countess
to
show
my
respect
but
i
not
a
countess
i
laughed
well
i
guess
i
just
go
one
better
and
raise
you
to
princess
then
it
the
best
i
can
do
having
been
reared
with
plain
misses
and
mississes
you
look
like
a
princess
anyhow
and
the
queen
might
be
proud
to
have
you
for
a
cousin
now
we
fixed
that
up
maybe
let
me
show
you
around
the
premises
and
you
can
tell
me
if
the
emporium
bears
any
resemblance
to
your
london
stores
very
well
prince
i
shall
be
delighted
said
i
and
he
laughed
a
nice
mellow
roar
it
was
a
great
thing
i
soon
found
for
a
visitor
to
be
escorted
by
the
proprietor
of
the
emporium
never
was
such
a
popular
and
man
as
he
he
was
wanted
everywhere
by
everybody
people
felt
aggrieved
if
they
had
to
go
away
without
at
least
a
hearty
how
do
you
do
from
whit
there
were
several
attendants
quite
dashing
young
men
but
they
were
mere
ciphers
compared
to
the
boss
accompanied
by
walker
and
patty
whom
he
chose
as
the
companion
of
our
explorations
we
went
upstairs
and
downstairs
and
left
no
corner
of
the
emporium
unvisited
are
you
afraid
to
leave
so
many
things
outside
on
the
verandah
i
asked
suppose
they
should
be
stolen
the
great
man
only
laughed
but
a
lanky
customer
who
overheard
drawled
out
what
steal
from
whit
walker
of
hermann
corners
i
guess
the
skunk
mean
enough
to
do
that
would
get
himself
lynched
by
every
decent
chap
in
this
darned
county
i
got
one
friend
you
see
princess
chuckled
my
king
of
the
emporium
you
got
two
said
i
well
now
that
mighty
pretty
of
you
say
do
you
mean
it
honour
bright
honour
bright
i
repeated
then
i
wonder
if
i
might
ask
a
little
favour
of
you
of
course
what
is
it
i
tell
you
before
we
part
but
come
on
down
now
girls
i
want
you
should
both
choose
a
present
to
take
home
we
picked
our
way
down
the
steep
stairs
littered
with
the
overflow
from
shelves
and
counters
in
the
principal
show
room
if
one
could
call
it
that
he
pressed
us
to
accept
some
jewellery
poor
stuff
but
the
best
he
had
and
he
ingenuously
admired
it
we
steadfastly
refused
however
and
patty
took
a
japanese
fan
while
i
selected
several
choice
specimens
of
chewing
gum
as
being
novel
and
characteristic
by
this
time
the
ice
cream
festival
was
beginning
it
was
held
in
a
vacant
lot
behind
the
emporium
and
a
canvas
awning
had
been
put
up
over
two
or
three
dozen
bare
tables
on
the
grass
several
employees
of
the
store
extra
hands
perhaps
were
kept
frantically
busy
ladling
out
from
huge
freezers
into
earthenware
saucers
big
slabs
of
frozen
custard
all
the
gallant
young
beaux
of
the
neighbourhood
treated
the
girls
they
wished
to
favour
and
spent
ten
cents
a
saucer
for
the
ice
cream
with
a
big
sugared
cooky
thrown
in
the
great
whit
himself
invited
me
to
sit
down
with
him
so
brett
who
had
been
coming
up
to
ask
patty
and
me
both
perhaps
whisked
patty
away
leaving
me
to
walker
now
i
tell
you
that
favour
i
want
said
he
i
hope
you
think
i
presuming
too
much
on
a
short
acquaintance
but
it
a
mighty
important
thing
for
me
it
about
that
little
gal
over
there
patty
i
asked
he
nodded
nobody
else
there
anybody
else
so
far
as
i
concerned
meaning
no
disrespect
to
you
princess
my
old
friend
the
honourable
says
she
just
worships
you
and
would
lie
down
and
let
you
walk
over
her
if
you
wanted
i
did
know
i
said
well
it
gospel
truth
i
guess
and
i
do
blame
her
if
you
she
has
been
to
me
i
interrupted
why
what
do
you
think
she
did
when
i
mentioned
that
the
huge
bells
on
jacobsen
cows
kept
me
awake
nights
you
know
how
that
one
field
of
jacobsen
which
he
wo
sell
comes
into
trowbridge
farm
and
he
keeps
his
cows
there
to
be
disagreeable
well
patty
got
up
in
the
night
and
climbed
on
the
fence
and
caught
the
cows
by
offering
them
salt
then
she
held
on
by
their
ears
and
tied
rags
over
their
bells
horrid
loud
bells
so
they
could
make
no
noise
only
fancy
and
some
of
those
cows
are
awfully
fierce
the
rags
have
stopped
on
ever
since
that
was
the
way
i
found
out
for
she
did
tell
for
days
it
just
like
that
pretty
quiet
little
thing
said
walker
i
wish
she
be
that
sweet
to
me
i
want
her
mighty
bad
to
have
me
princess
but
she
read
novels
i
guess
and
anyhow
she
does
think
i
romantic
enough
i
was
always
kind
of
afraid
there
was
somebody
else
now
i
should
wonder
if
it
ai
that
young
cousin
of
the
trowbridges
could
you
find
out
for
me
as
she
thinks
such
a
lot
of
you
and
if
she
has
got
her
heart
too
much
set
on
anybody
else
could
you
try
to
use
your
influence
for
me
you
see
you
a
travelled
lady
though
you
so
young
and
if
you
could
say
i
was
a
man
in
your
opinion
it
might
make
all
the
difference
you
can
depend
on
me
to
do
my
best
i
said
but
i
did
feel
amused
and
full
of
fun
any
more
as
i
looked
over
at
patty
and
brett
if
she
admires
him
and
how
could
she
help
it
there
no
reason
why
he
should
admire
her
when
one
comes
to
think
of
it
she
is
pretty
and
sweet
a
perfect
little
lady
and
an
heiress
i
ca
get
used
to
the
idea
the
cowbells
did
ring
at
all
last
night
but
i
could
sleep
for
thinking
of
it
and
for
telling
myself
that
perhaps
this
is
why
brett
looked
queer
when
i
spoke
of
patty
marrying
a
farmer
xix
about
getting
engaged
i
felt
when
i
got
up
this
morning
that
i
was
in
a
dreadfully
embarrassing
and
uncomfortable
position
about
patty
and
my
promise
to
walker
if
i
kept
it
and
tried
to
use
my
influence
with
her
it
might
be
that
i
would
be
working
against
brett
it
would
be
hateful
to
do
that
as
we
are
such
friends
but
i
was
afraid
there
must
be
something
rather
catty
in
my
nature
though
i
never
thought
so
before
because
i
could
not
approve
of
a
marriage
between
him
and
patty
my
private
opinion
was
that
patty
was
at
all
the
sort
of
girl
to
make
him
happy
but
i
did
dare
to
depend
too
much
on
the
wisdom
of
my
opinion
lest
it
should
be
biassed
by
prejudice
it
is
so
hard
when
you
have
a
friend
who
has
been
all
yours
to
see
that
some
other
girl
may
be
more
congenial
to
him
than
you
are
and
that
the
best
thing
for
him
would
be
to
fall
in
love
with
her
brett
has
known
patty
for
a
long
time
and
though
he
has
been
here
often
he
has
made
flying
visits
sometimes
i
know
and
even
patty
and
ide
both
call
him
jim
never
brett
i
reminded
myself
as
i
thought
it
all
over
that
probably
one
reason
why
he
wanted
to
stay
with
his
cousins
now
was
to
see
patty
again
not
in
the
least
because
of
his
friendship
with
me
which
is
quite
a
recent
thing
compared
to
his
acquaintance
with
patty
i
had
to
admit
that
though
we
have
been
such
friends
all
he
has
done
for
me
could
easily
be
accounted
for
by
that
american
chivalry
to
women
on
which
the
men
over
here
are
so
keen
as
a
nation
rather
than
any
particular
liking
for
me
as
a
girl
and
i
must
have
a
horrid
exacting
disposition
because
discovering
this
made
me
feel
absolutely
ill
i
was
so
jealous
of
patty
because
she
could
perhaps
take
away
my
best
friend
and
have
him
for
her
lover
that
all
her
pretty
little
ways
and
looks
quite
annoyed
me
and
i
felt
i
could
have
slapped
her
such
feelings
made
me
hate
myself
for
it
is
so
unpleasant
finding
out
suddenly
that
you
are
a
brute
yet
i
would
not
indulge
my
wicked
heart
by
telling
patty
that
she
ought
to
marry
walker
i
could
scarcely
eat
any
breakfast
or
dinner
and
early
in
the
afternoon
i
crept
out
of
doors
very
miserable
i
felt
that
vivace
was
the
only
being
on
earth
who
really
cared
for
me
and
even
he
was
more
interested
at
the
time
in
a
rabbit
hole
he
had
found
than
in
my
society
he
would
come
away
from
it
when
i
called
so
i
bundled
him
under
my
arm
and
walked
off
with
him
to
the
sugar
camp
where
i
could
be
alone
and
think
things
over
without
having
people
say
i
looked
pale
and
ask
whether
the
ice
cream
festival
at
hermann
corners
had
given
me
a
headache
patty
and
ide
had
decided
to
make
maple
candy
and
chocolate
fudge
after
dinner
so
that
we
could
have
it
to
eat
in
the
evening
and
brett
and
i
had
promised
to
help
american
girls
always
seem
to
make
candy
if
they
have
nothing
else
more
interesting
to
do
and
usually
i
think
it
very
entertaining
carolyn
pitchley
often
went
wrong
and
she
would
keep
several
servants
busy
clearing
away
plates
and
spoons
bringing
fresh
ones
and
cleaning
out
the
chafing
dish
which
she
had
burnt
but
patty
and
ide
are
cleverer
they
do
everything
for
themselves
and
i
should
have
enjoyed
helping
if
i
had
been
in
a
different
mood
as
it
was
i
would
have
realised
that
i
was
an
outsider
and
that
maybe
they
would
be
gayer
without
me
though
they
are
always
so
polite
i
had
slipped
away
without
speaking
to
anyone
and
as
i
was
pretty
sure
that
no
one
would
come
to
the
sugar
camp
at
this
time
of
day
i
could
let
myself
be
as
gloomy
as
i
liked
i
sat
there
in
the
deep
green
shade
of
the
maples
on
the
log
where
brett
and
i
had
talked
the
first
day
i
came
to
the
valley
farm
all
the
disagreeable
things
that
ever
happened
to
me
since
i
was
a
child
took
this
opportunity
to
stir
in
their
graves
and
come
to
life
again
then
they
sat
down
in
front
of
me
in
a
dreary
semicircle
staring
me
in
the
face
until
i
could
stand
it
any
longer
and
began
to
cry
vivace
was
very
much
surprised
and
jumped
up
with
his
paws
in
my
lap
as
if
he
were
saying
what
the
matter
this
was
a
comfort
and
i
put
my
head
down
on
his
with
my
arms
round
his
neck
and
cried
more
if
you
once
let
yourself
go
like
that
you
ca
stop
hearing
your
own
little
chokes
and
gasps
makes
you
pity
yourself
so
much
that
your
heart
nearly
breaks
i
was
sobbing
out
loud
presently
which
made
vivace
whine
and
i
had
almost
begun
to
enjoy
my
utter
forlornness
and
the
distinction
of
being
the
most
miserable
person
in
the
whole
world
when
a
distracted
voice
exclaimed
why
lady
betty
lady
betty
for
heaven
sake
what
happened
i
looked
up
all
teary
and
flushed
and
there
was
brett
staring
at
me
with
horrified
eyes
and
his
face
as
desperate
as
if
he
had
found
me
struck
by
lightning
or
gored
by
the
black
and
white
bull
i
was
so
ashamed
and
confused
that
i
could
speak
but
just
sat
there
gazing
up
helplessly
at
him
with
tears
running
down
my
cheeks
and
my
lips
trembling
the
most
awful
look
came
into
his
eyes
and
he
went
as
pale
as
i
was
red
my
precious
one
my
darling
he
stammered
and
dropping
down
on
one
knee
by
the
big
log
he
put
his
arms
round
me
oh
i
said
and
then
my
head
was
nestling
down
into
his
neck
and
instead
of
being
wretched
i
was
perfectly
happy
who
has
dared
to
make
you
cry
he
asked
holding
me
close
you
i
answered
i
i
thought
you
were
only
being
kind
to
me
because
because
you
an
american
and
it
your
duty
to
a
foreigner
he
laughed
at
that
an
excited
happy
laugh
with
a
queer
break
in
it
i
been
half
out
of
my
mind
with
love
for
you
ever
since
the
first
day
i
saw
you
looking
down
at
me
in
the
steerage
am
i
out
of
it
now
or
can
it
be
true
that
you
care
for
me
just
a
little
little
bit
i
care
for
you
said
i
why
this
is
friendship
is
it
it
being
in
love
i
should
think
it
was
with
me
he
said
it
all
of
me
heart
soul
and
body
drowning
in
love
do
drown
i
whispered
to
him
i
ca
spare
you
after
that
we
did
say
a
word
but
i
had
supposed
it
was
possible
for
any
human
creature
to
feel
so
seraphically
happy
as
i
did
i
know
how
long
a
time
passed
before
we
even
spoke
but
it
seemed
only
a
minute
a
minute
stolen
straight
out
of
heaven
and
he
was
so
handsome
and
dear
that
i
would
have
kept
that
minute
forever
if
i
could
for
it
was
impossible
to
believe
that
another
could
be
so
perfect
but
by
and
by
it
did
merge
into
sister
minutes
just
as
good
and
we
began
to
talk
and
tell
each
other
things
he
told
me
again
how
he
loved
me
from
the
very
first
instant
and
i
told
him
that
after
the
day
on
the
dock
if
not
before
i
never
quite
had
him
out
of
my
thoughts
for
a
moment
there
has
always
been
a
sort
of
of
you
i
went
on
no
matter
what
else
i
was
thinking
of
just
as
sally
says
when
you
are
near
the
sea
you
hear
it
through
every
other
sound
he
liked
having
me
say
that
and
his
eyes
too
glorious
when
he
likes
things
that
i
say
i
loved
you
so
much
he
answered
that
i
felt
my
love
have
some
power
over
your
heart
it
could
go
for
nothing
i
knew
i
worthy
of
you
but
the
love
was
for
no
man
in
your
own
world
could
offer
you
a
greater
one
that
my
justification
for
asking
you
to
put
your
hand
in
mine
but
am
i
asking
too
much
are
you
sure
you
regret
anything
you
may
have
to
give
up
there
nothing
i
would
give
up
to
be
with
you
always
i
assured
him
but
i
do
see
that
i
shall
have
to
give
up
much
that
i
really
care
for
we
shall
be
poor
of
course
but
i
sha
mind
that
a
bit
with
you
we
can
live
in
a
sweet
little
cottage
somewhere
we
or
if
you
have
to
be
in
a
town
we
shall
have
a
wee
wee
flat
and
it
will
be
such
fun
looking
after
it
just
like
having
a
doll
house
only
a
hundred
times
better
i
never
been
rich
you
know
always
been
rather
a
struggle
and
ever
so
many
of
my
dresses
have
been
made
out
of
mother
or
victoria
i
shall
learn
to
cook
and
sew
if
i
were
so
poor
as
all
that
darling
i
should
be
asking
you
to
marry
me
said
jim
i
better
off
than
you
think
for
as
i
told
you
i
been
doing
fairly
well
lately
and
i
guess
if
one
of
us
two
ever
has
to
cook
it
will
be
i
we
might
have
to
do
that
sometimes
but
it
will
only
be
if
we
camping
somewhere
i
do
hope
so
it
would
be
glorious
i
exclaimed
we
can
have
the
cottage
or
the
flat
all
right
or
maybe
even
both
if
things
go
on
as
well
as
they
going
now
he
said
and
nothing
on
god
earth
i
wo
do
to
make
you
happy
heavens
i
should
think
so
after
what
you
doing
for
me
trusting
me
without
knowing
any
more
of
me
than
you
seen
in
these
few
weeks
i
have
trusted
you
to
the
world
end
after
the
day
you
jumped
overboard
and
saved
the
little
boy
besides
you
were
and
have
trusted
you
just
the
same
if
you
had
bless
you
my
angel
but
think
of
the
marriages
you
might
have
made
i
could
have
made
more
than
one
at
least
i
hope
not
said
i
flippantly
i
could
have
married
anyone
but
you
so
i
should
have
had
to
be
an
old
maid
if
you
had
asked
me
and
think
how
awful
that
would
have
been
you
regret
asking
me
do
you
regret
well
it
does
bear
talking
of
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
able
to
say
that
i
meant
to
keep
my
love
to
myself
and
it
only
sprang
out
on
an
ungovernable
impulse
but
it
would
be
true
if
i
did
i
always
meant
to
ask
you
from
the
very
first
though
i
had
little
enough
hope
even
up
to
that
it
would
be
anything
more
than
friendship
on
your
part
but
oh
how
hard
i
did
mean
to
try
for
you
my
one
virtue
was
to
wait
until
you
had
seen
enough
of
other
men
men
of
a
different
sort
for
you
to
be
sure
you
did
prefer
one
of
them
and
when
accident
had
put
you
very
near
me
i
did
manage
not
to
lose
my
head
and
speak
while
you
were
in
a
way
under
my
protection
for
that
would
have
been
brutal
but
heaven
knows
and
miss
woodburn
knows
that
i
came
mighty
near
it
once
or
twice
i
thankful
i
did
now
you
know
the
best
and
worst
of
the
other
sort
of
man
and
the
best
and
worst
of
me
you
see
the
kind
of
people
whose
blood
runs
in
my
veins
and
still
you
are
ready
to
say
that
my
people
shall
be
your
people
i
not
afraid
of
anything
that
can
happen
now
you
need
be
i
said
slipping
my
other
hand
into
his
for
he
had
one
of
them
already
mother
may
be
vexed
with
me
for
going
against
her
wishes
but
she
will
have
to
forgive
me
or
even
if
she
does
i
shall
have
you
i
think
she
will
forgive
you
darling
said
jim
i
will
make
her
forgive
you
i
believe
you
could
make
anybody
do
anything
i
cried
sally
will
be
glad
about
this
i
know
i
can
see
now
that
she
must
always
have
hoped
for
it
to
happen
though
i
did
realise
what
she
meant
at
the
time
but
we
had
a
talk
in
the
park
the
day
we
met
you
about
marrying
for
love
and
she
advised
me
that
it
was
the
only
thing
to
do
oh
i
am
sorry
for
everybody
who
is
in
love
are
you
and
that
reminds
me
i
must
try
and
make
dear
little
patty
in
love
with
walker
help
me
wo
you
the
rest
of
the
day
was
perfectly
divine
and
it
is
almost
as
delightful
to
live
it
over
again
as
i
am
doing
now
in
writing
the
story
of
it
after
we
have
said
we
forgot
all
about
going
back
to
the
house
until
some
one
came
out
and
rang
the
bell
for
tea
in
the
field
where
we
could
help
hearing
then
we
told
the
cousins
our
news
and
they
were
immensely
pleased
they
seemed
to
think
that
jim
and
i
were
made
for
each
other
and
trowbridge
said
she
had
seen
that
it
was
coming
all
along
after
tea
we
walked
over
to
call
on
sally
and
she
was
just
as
glad
as
i
thought
she
would
be
you
are
going
to
marry
one
of
the
finest
fellows
on
earth
i
believe
said
she
and
i
congratulate
you
as
well
as
him
i
do
love
sally
xx
about
jim
and
the
duke
it
was
a
very
different
waking
up
the
next
day
my
first
thought
was
can
it
be
really
true
or
is
it
only
a
dream
that
i
engaged
to
jim
and
i
almost
cried
for
joy
when
i
was
quite
sure
it
was
true
we
both
wrote
letters
to
my
mother
and
so
did
sally
i
did
see
theirs
but
i
could
guess
what
they
said
and
i
could
trust
sally
to
praise
jim
still
all
the
praises
in
the
world
would
reconcile
mother
to
what
i
was
going
to
do
i
could
hear
her
saying
who
he
and
i
was
sure
she
would
add
how
much
has
he
got
but
whatever
happened
we
were
not
going
to
give
each
other
up
jim
had
promised
trowbridge
to
pronounce
judgment
on
a
horse
which
he
thought
of
buying
and
the
man
who
wanted
to
sell
the
creature
brought
it
to
the
farm
about
eleven
sally
had
come
to
tell
about
the
letter
she
had
just
posted
to
mother
and
jim
was
in
the
sitting
room
writing
his
i
think
he
had
forgotten
about
the
horse
until
trowbridge
appeared
looking
rather
excited
say
jim
he
exclaimed
jake
jacobsen
here
with
the
horse
round
by
the
barn
now
and
you
might
as
well
have
a
look
at
it
but
it
an
awful
brute
and
i
ai
going
to
take
it
at
any
price
what
the
matter
with
the
horse
asked
jim
sealing
up
his
letter
and
looking
interested
it
mad
crazy
that
all
but
it
enough
for
me
i
thought
there
must
be
something
wrong
for
jake
to
be
offering
it
at
the
price
he
did
he
led
it
here
and
you
just
ought
to
have
seen
the
brute
dance
and
make
ugly
eyes
when
first
albert
and
then
i
tried
to
get
astride
of
it
jake
swears
the
only
reason
he
sell
cheap
is
because
his
wife
has
taken
a
dislike
to
the
horse
and
what
she
says
goes
with
him
ready
to
bet
anything
the
animal
as
mild
as
a
lamb
only
a
bit
frisky
and
certainly
it
as
handsome
a
beast
as
i
ever
laid
eyes
on
but
he
have
to
get
rid
of
it
at
the
fair
i
come
said
jim
getting
up
i
jumped
up
too
oh
please
do
have
anything
to
do
with
such
a
vicious
creature
i
begged
you
might
be
killed
jim
laughed
the
horse
is
sired
that
could
kill
me
i
reckon
i
know
them
too
well
why
little
girl
i
was
brought
up
among
horses
you
can
trust
me
not
to
run
too
big
risks
now
i
got
something
to
make
life
worth
living
stan
has
often
told
me
that
men
hate
girls
to
fuss
over
them
so
i
bit
my
lip
and
did
tease
any
more
but
i
was
far
from
happy
i
like
the
look
in
his
eyes
may
sally
and
i
go
and
see
the
horse
with
you
i
meekly
asked
i
ride
him
up
to
the
house
if
i
find
he
worth
your
seeing
jim
said
but
you
must
worry
if
we
do
come
this
way
for
awhile
i
may
have
to
work
with
him
a
bit
before
he
ready
to
show
himself
off
to
ladies
with
that
he
got
his
hat
and
went
out
with
trowbridge
who
was
waiting
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
oh
dear
i
feel
as
if
something
horrid
was
going
to
happen
i
said
to
sally
when
they
had
gone
pooh
said
she
i
should
be
sorry
for
the
animal
who
tried
to
play
tricks
with
that
young
man
you
find
you
have
known
him
till
you
see
him
on
a
horse
i
daresay
i
silly
i
admitted
but
i
have
a
presentiment
of
let
go
and
sit
out
on
the
verandah
and
watch
we
see
the
barn
but
if
they
come
out
in
the
farm
road
we
shall
catch
sight
of
them
all
right
said
sally
the
sun
hot
on
the
verandah
but
that
a
detail
already
jim
and
trowbridge
had
disappeared
but
as
we
were
choosing
the
coolest
place
for
our
chairs
we
saw
a
dusty
nondescript
old
vehicle
rattling
up
the
maple
avenue
and
just
about
to
turn
into
the
narrow
road
which
leads
round
the
side
of
the
house
the
hood
was
up
to
protect
the
passengers
from
the
sun
so
at
first
we
could
see
only
the
driver
and
gather
an
indistinct
impression
that
there
were
two
figures
in
the
back
seat
visitors
said
i
i
did
know
trowbridge
was
expecting
then
i
broke
off
with
a
little
gasp
oh
sally
it
the
duke
and
katherine
she
gurgled
all
my
blood
raced
up
to
my
head
as
if
i
were
going
to
have
a
sunstroke
no
wonder
i
had
a
presentiment
i
groaned
forgetting
my
fright
about
the
horse
for
a
moment
do
stand
by
me
i
will
said
sally
trowbridge
and
the
girls
were
busy
in
the
kitchen
making
peach
jam
so
when
the
wretched
old
chaise
drew
up
close
to
the
verandah
sally
and
i
were
alone
to
receive
it
if
my
sense
of
humour
had
been
trampled
upon
by
various
emotions
which
were
all
jumping
about
at
the
same
time
i
should
have
had
hard
work
not
to
laugh
when
stan
and
ess
kay
scrambled
out
from
under
the
lumbering
old
hood
which
was
like
a
great
coal
scuttle
turned
over
their
heads
their
hair
was
grey
with
dust
their
faces
purple
with
heat
and
evidently
they
were
both
in
towering
tempers
stan
looked
at
me
the
way
he
did
once
when
i
was
small
and
spoiled
his
favourite
cricket
bat
by
digging
up
worms
with
it
as
if
he
could
have
shaken
me
well
and
boxed
my
ears
and
would
if
i
were
a
girl
as
for
ess
kay
she
smiled
but
her
smile
meant
worse
things
than
frown
hullo
dear
boy
i
chirped
nervously
how
do
you
do
mrs
sally
murmured
something
too
and
stan
had
the
grace
to
claw
off
his
hat
showing
how
damp
his
poor
hair
was
on
his
crimson
forehead
but
he
did
even
pretend
to
smile
a
nice
dance
you
led
us
said
he
by
jove
i
would
have
thought
it
of
you
betty
maybe
you
do
understand
yet
said
i
wait
till
i
explained
and
i
sure
you
wo
be
cross
because
you
always
were
a
dear
it
no
good
wheedling
he
grumbled
i
not
going
to
wait

stan

to

you
after
the
way

anybody

you

eight
instead

bread
and
water
for
making
me

three
thousand
miles
to
fetch

i
did
ask

i
and
you

have
bothered

yet
yes
she
is
the
day
before
i
started
what
that
got
to
do
with
it
a
good
deal
according
to
her
i
replied
i
engaged
too
the
dickens
you
are
exclaimed
stan
getting
redder
than
ever
while
ess
kay
gave
a
little
start
and
glared
at
sally
my
blood
was
up
now
and
i
did
care
what
i
said
the
sooner
stan
knew
everything
just
as
it
was
the
better
yes
the
dickens
i
am
i
echoed
defiantly
and
i
do
intend
to
be
treated
like
a
naughty
child
by
anyone
i
done
nothing
wrong
or
underhand
we
only
been
engaged
since
yesterday
though
we
both
fell
in
love
at
first
sight
on
shipboard
and
we
written
to
mother
and
you
this
very
morning
engaged
to
a
man
you
met
on
shipboard
repeated
stan
looking
flabbergasted
and
turning
from
me
to
ess
kay
tom
doremus
she
gasped
yet
no
that
impossible
he
in
newport
but
there
was
no
one
else
i
was
particularly
careful
i
am
engaged
to
marry
james
brett
i
said
he
is
there
was
no
such
man
on
the
ship
she
broke
in
sharply
then
suddenly
she
almost
jumped
goodness
she
exclaimed
oh
duke
this
is
too
i
remember
there
was
a
person
in
the
but
this
is
madness
it
ca
be
he
did
cross
in
the
steerage
i
said
what
of
it
he
is
the
best
and
handsomest
man
i
ever
saw
and
there
no
finer
gentleman
than
he
you
can
ask
sally
if
there
is
for
she
knows
him
and
thoroughly
approves
of
him
sally
finished
taking
my
hand
duke
i
assure
you
betty
is
to
be
congratulated
i
understand
that
the
duchess
was
not
averse
to
her
marrying
an
american
and
the
one
she
has
chosen
is
of
the
very
best
type
i
beg
your
pardon
miss
woodburn
but
hang
the
type
said
stan
who
never
did
get
on
with
sally
it
absolutely
impossible
that
my
sister
should
marry
such
a
person
and
you
ought
to
have
known
better
than
to
encourage
her
this
is
a
hundred
times
worse
than
i
thought
when
i
flung
up
the
best
shoot
of
the
season
to
come
and
fetch
you
betty
you
and
i
were
always
by
way
of
being
pals
but
i
agree
with
the
mater
now
you
behaved
disgracefully
and
as
for
the
man
whoever
he
is
here
he
comes
to
speak
for
himself
cut
in
sally
squeezing
my
hand
hard
there
was
a
sound
in
the
distance
voices
shouting
but
not
the
voice
i
loved
we
all
looked
and
a
black
horse
with
a
man
on
his
back
sprang
into
sight
like
a
rocket
gone
wrong
it
was
jim
looking
more
beautiful
than
any
picture
of
a
man
ever
painted
his
face
transported
with
the
joy
of
battle
and
triumph
and
that
fiend
in
horse
shape
under
him
doing
all
he
knew
to
kill
it
was
a
terrible
and
yet
a
splendid
thing
to
see
that
struggle
i
had
known
how
i
adored
jim
and
how
i
admired
him
till
i
saw
him
with
that
smile
on
his
face
sitting
the
black
devil
as
if
he
were
one
with
him
in
spite
of
the
brute
murderous
plunges
the
two
shot
past
the
house
like
a
streak
of
lightning
then
wheeled
back
again
the
horse
clearing
a
ditch
and
a
fence
from
one
meadow
into
another
but
he
did
jump
in
spite
of
jim
rather
was
it
in
spite
of
himself
then
there
was
a
series
of
mad
buck
jumpings
leaps
into
the
air
and
downward
plunges
the
beast
sat
on
his
haunches
and
then
reared
up
with
a
great
bound
to
waltz
on
his
hind
legs
and
paw
the
air
snorting
but
still
jim
smiled
and
kept
his
seat
without
the
least
apparent
effort
illustration
smiled
and
kept
his
seat
without
the
least
apparent
jove
that
fellow
can
ride
muttered
stan
taken
out
of
himself
by
his
man
admiration
for
a
man
it
jim
brett
jim
brett
i
cried
what
do
you
think
of
him
now
but
it
did
occur
to
stan
to
answer
i
do
suppose
he
even
heard
he
was
far
too
deeply
absorbed
in
the
passing
drama
and
in
a
minute
more
jim
and
the
black
horse
were
out
of
sight
again
but
i
was
not
at
all
afraid
for
him
now
i
was
only
proud
and
sure
as
sure
as
i
was
of
life
that
he
would
conquer
nobody
spoke
trowbridge
and
jacobsen
the
disagreeable
cowbell
man
who
owned
the
horse
ran
by
as
fast
as
they
could
go
too
excited
to
glance
at
the
house
and
albert
and
elisha
followed
trowbridge
and
the
girls
had
come
out
from
the
kitchen
and
were
hanging
over
the
nearest
fence
patty
was
whimpering
a
little
so
i
guessed
all
in
a
flash
that
she
had
cared
for
jim
but
she
is
so
sweet
she
will
get
over
it
now
he
is
mine
and
already
i
made
her
realise
thoroughly
what
a
fine
fellow
the
great
whit
is
we
stood
still
in
our
places
and
watched
i
could
hear
my
heart
beat
and
it
had
not
time
to
calm
down
before
jim
came
riding
back
on
the
black
horse
a
changed
black
horse
all
winning
airs
and
graces
to
cover
shamed
penitence
now
the
creature
pirouetted
up
the
side
road
and
jim
stopped
him
at
the
verandah
patting
the
throbbing
black
neck
well
i
believe
i
buy
him
myself
he
said
smiling
to
me
and
then
he
saw
ess
kay
and
my
brother
by
jove
harborough
said
stan
it
you
is
it
surely
it
is
your
double
harborough
it
is
said
jim
while
i
listened
dumb
with
wonder
how
are
you
duke
i
was
rather
expecting
you
might
turn
up
but
i
cabled
to
you
last
night
to
boodles
and
wrote
you
this
morning
on
the
chance
you
had
started
well
i
blowed
remarked
stan
most
inelegantly
are
you
brett
or
is
brett
you
or
is
he
somebody
else
my
name
is
james
brett
harborough
perhaps
you
did
know
or
had
forgotten
said
jim
and
then
jumping
off
the
horse
and
throwing
the
lines
to
jacobsen
who
had
just
trotted
anxiously
up
he
came
to
me
will
you
forgive
me
he
asked
i
do
know
yet
what
it
all
about
i
said
dully
miss
woodburn
knows
and
mohunsleigh
knew
you
see
he
and
i
were
old
pals
so
i
told
him
i
was
in
love
with
his
cousin
and
was
going
to
try
hard
to
win
her
in
my
own
way
you
remember
mohunsleigh
friend
harborough
you
said
the
other
day
you
were
sorry
for
him
and
you
wished
him
joy
of
his
love
affair
oh
is
the
reason
you
pretended
to
be
only
jim
brett
i
jim
brett
but
now
you
understand
will
you
forgive
me
i
do
understand
yet
except
that
you
must
have
been
afraid
i
might
care
more
for
your
money
than
for
you
if
i
knew
oh
how
you
think
such
a
thing
of
me
but
about
the
steerage
that
was
beforehand
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
though
everything
that
was
to
come
came
from
it
i
was
abroad
for
a
couple
of
years
and
a
friend
i
knocked
up
against
in
paris
last
june
bet
me
a
thousand
dollars
that
in
spite
of
all
my
queer
experiences
i
would
have
the
pluck
to
rough
it
in
the
steerage
of
a
big
ocean
liner
i
took
the
bet
and
won
it
if
it
had
been
for
seeing
you
i
should
have
gone
west
almost
at
once
after
landing
in
new
york
but
i
seen
you
so
i
stayed
luckily
for
me
i
met
miss
woodburn
often
in
san
francisco
and
once
here
she
recognised
me
in
my
steerage
and
was
the
only
one
who
did
but
her
tact
kept
her
from
spoiling
sport
she
guessed
there
must
be
a
game
on
and
said
not
a
word
to
anyone
she
would
even
if
i
had
managed
to
send
her
a
note
which
i
did
i
had
a
conversation
with
her
on
board
too
the
day
before
getting
in
and
we
talked
about
you
even
then
i
felt
sure
you
could
be
the
sort
of
girl
to
care
about
money
but
it
was
partly
my
fault
betty
sally
broke
in
when
he
paused
to
be
quite
quite
frank
i
knew
that
the
duchess
had
fallen
in
with
some
ideas
of
katherine
and
i
could
tell
how
far
your
bringing
up
might
have
influenced
your
nature
so
i
encouraged
harborough
to
test
you
by
keeping
up
the
story
that
he
was
a
poor
young
fellow
named
jim
brett
it
handicapped
him
and
kept
him
away
from
you
but
you
were
interested
in
him
to
start
with
and
i
did
my
best
to
keep
up
the
romance
i
thought
he
would
lose
by
it
in
the
end
and
he
has
there
was
the
morning
in
the
park
i
managed
that
and
i
got
katherine
to
send
him
an
invitation
to
her
big
party
he
was
playing
a
waiting
game
because
he
wanted
you
to
care
in
spite
of
every
drawback
or
else
he
would
want
you
to
care
at
all
and
then
before
he
was
ready
for
any
fate
stepped
in
and
did
the
rest
in
the
best
way
it
could
have
been
done
i
think
said
jim
now
little
girl
do
you
understand
and
have
you
forgiven
me
i
like
to
think
you
could
have
trusted
me
from
the
very
first
without
playing
at
all
i
answered
still
it
romantic
it
and
besides
even
if
i
were
very
angry
i
i
afraid
i
forgive
you
after
seeing
you
ride
that
horse
i
hanged
if
i
could
too
said
stan
and
laughing
the
two
shook
hands
and
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
as
well
purred
ess
kay
quite
kittenish
if
only
would
introduce
harborough
to
me
as
if
anyone
cared
whether
she
forgave
him
or
not
what
about
the
duchess
asked
sally
oh
when
i
tell
her
that
betty
engaged
to
marry
a
chap
i
met
and
liked
in
town
a
thorough
sportsman
too
it
will
be
all
right
said
stan
i
was
glad
he
did
refer
to
jim
money
even
though
that
the
thing
which
will
appeal
most
to
mother
as
for
me
i
am
almost
sorry
he
is
poor
if
there
room
in
my
heart
to
be
sorry
about
anything
but
i
do
believe
there
is
it
such
a
beautiful
world
and
i
shall
have
two
homes
in
it
now
one
on
each
side
the
water
