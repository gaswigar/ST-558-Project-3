s
notes
as
you
may
be
aware
project
gutenberg
has
been
involved
with
the
writings
of
both
the
alexandre
dumases
for
some
time
now
and
since
we
get
a
few
questions
about
the
order
in
which
the
books
should
be
read
and
in
which
they
were
published
these
following
comments
should
hopefully
help
most
of
our
readers
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
is
the
final
volume
of
d
artagnan
romances
it
is
usually
split
into
three
or
four
parts
and
the
final
portion
is
entitled
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
we
re
familiar
with
today
is
the
last
volume
of
the
edition
not
all
the
editions
split
them
in
the
same
manner
hence
some
of
the
confusion
but
wait
there
s
yet
more
reason
for
confusion
we
intend
to
do
all
of
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
split
into
four
etexts
entitled
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
ten
years
later
louise
de
la
valliere
and
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
you
will
be
getting
the
man
in
the
iron
mask
one
thing
that
may
be
causing
confusion
is
that
the
etext
we
have
now
entitled
ten
years
later
says
it
s
the
sequel
to
the
three
musketeers
while
this
is
technically
true
there
s
another
book
twenty
years
after
that
comes
between
the
confusion
is
generated
by
the
two
facts
that
we
published
ten
years
later
before
we
published
twenty
years
after
and
that
many
people
see
those
titles
as
meaning
ten
and
twenty
years
after
the
original
story
however
this
is
why
the
different
words
after
and
later
the
ten
years
after
is
ten
years
after
the
twenty
years
per
history
also
the
third
book
of
the
d
artagnan
romances
while
entitled
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
has
the
subtitle
ten
years
later
these
two
titles
are
also
given
to
different
volumes
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
can
refer
to
the
whole
book
or
the
first
volume
of
the
three
or
editions
ten
years
later
can
similarly
refer
to
the
whole
book
or
the
second
volume
of
the
edition
to
add
to
the
confusion
in
the
case
of

unwitting
overhears

confessing

chatting
with

few
days
later
during
a
rainstorm
louis
and
louise
are
trapped
alone
together
and
the
whole
court
begins
to
talk
of
the
scandal
while
their

blossoms
aware
of
louise
s
attachment
the
king
arranges
for
raoul
to
be
sent
to
england
for
an
indefinite
period
meanwhile
the
struggle
for
power
continues
between
fouquet
and
colbert
although
the
plot
backfired
colbert
prompts
the
king
to
ask
fouquet
for
more
and
more
money
and
without
his
two
friends
to
raise
it
for
him
fouquet
is
sorely
pressed
the
situation
gets
so
bad
that
his
new
mistress
madame
de
belliere
must
resort
to
selling
all
her
jewels
and
her
gold
and
silver
plate
aramis
while
this
is
going
on
has
grown
friendly
with
the
governor
of
the
bastile
de
baisemeaux
a
fact
that
baisemeaux
unwittingly
reveals
to
d
artagnan
while
inquiring
of
him
as
to
aramis
s
whereabouts
this
further
arouses
the
suspicions
of
the
musketeer
who
was
made
to
look
ridiculous
by
aramis
he
had
ridden
overnight
at
an
insane
pace
but
arrived
a
few
minutes
after
fouquet
had
already
presented
to
the
king
aramis
learns
from
the
governor
the
location
of
a
mysterious
prisoner
who
bears
a
remarkable
resemblance
to
louis
xiv
in
fact
the
two
are
identical
he
uses
the
existence
of
this
secret
to
persuade
a
dying
franciscan
monk
the
general
of
the
society
of
the
jesuits
to
name
him
aramis
the
new
general
of
the
order
on
aramis
s
advice
hoping
to
use
louise
s
influence
with
the
king
to
counteract
colbert
s
influence
fouquet
also
writes
a
love
letter
to
la
valliere
unfortunately
undated
it
never
reaches
its
destination
however
as
the
servant
ordered
to
deliver
it
turns
out
to
be
an
agent
of
colbert
s
porthos
in
the
meantime
has
been
recovering
from
his
midnight
ride
from
at
fouquet
s
residence
at
athos
has
retired
once
again
to
la
fere
d
artagnan
little
amused
by
the
court
s
activities
at
fontainebleau
and
finding
himself
with
nothing
to
do
has
returned
to
paris
and
we
find
him
again
in
planchet

grocery
shop

story
continues

during
all
these
long
and
noisy
debates
between
the
opposite
ambitions
of
politics
and
love
one
of
our
characters
perhaps
the
one
least
deserving
of
neglect
was
however
very
much
neglected
very
much
forgotten
and
exceedingly
unhappy
in
fact
d
artagnan
d
artagnan
we
say
for
we
must
call
him
by
his
name
to
remind
our
readers
of
his
existence
d
artagnan
we
repeat
had
absolutely
nothing
whatever
to
do
amidst
these
brilliant
butterflies
of
fashion
after
following
the
king
during
two
whole
days
at
fontainebleau
and
critically
observing
the
various
pastoral
fancies
and
transformations
of
his
sovereign
the
musketeer
felt
that
he
needed
something
more
than
this
to
satisfy
the
cravings
of
his
nature
at
every
moment
assailed
by
people
asking
him
how
do
you
think
this
costume
suits
me
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
would
reply
to
them
in
quiet
sarcastic
tones
why
i
think
you
are
quite
as
as
the
monkey
to
be
found
in
the
fair
at
it
was
just
such
a
compliment
d
artagnan
would
choose
where
he
did
not
feel
disposed
to
pay
any
other
and
whether
agreeable
or
not
the
inquirer
was
obliged
to
be
satisfied
with
it
whenever
any
one
asked
him
how
do
you
intend
to
dress
yourself
this
evening
he
replied
i
shall
undress
myself
at
which
the
ladies
all
laughed
and
a
few
of
them
blushed
but
after
a
couple
of
days
passed
in
this
manner
the
musketeer
perceiving
that
nothing
serious
was
likely
to
arise
which
would
concern
him
and
that
the
king
had
completely
or
at
least
appeared
to
have
completely
forgotten
paris
and
that
colbert
s
mind
was
occupied
with
illuminations
and
fireworks
that
for
the
next
month
at
least
the
ladies
had
plenty
of
glances
to
bestow
and
also
to
receive
in
exchange
d
artagnan
asked
the
king
for
leave
of
absence
for
a
matter
of
private
business
at
the
moment
d
artagnan
made
his
request
his
majesty
was
on
the
point
of
going
to
bed
quite
exhausted
from
dancing
you
wish
to
leave
me
monsieur
d
artagnan
inquired
the
king
with
an
air
of
astonishment
for
louis
xiv
could
never
understand
why
any
one
who
had
the
distinguished
honor
of
being
near
him
could
wish
to
leave
him
sire
said
d
artagnan
i
leave
you
simply
because
i
am
not
of
the
slightest
service
to
you
in
anything
ah
if
i
could
only
hold
the
while
you
were
dancing
it
would
be
a
very
different
but
my
dear
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
king
gravely
people
dance
without
ah
indeed
said
the
musketeer
continuing
his
imperceptible
tone
of
irony
i
had
no
idea
such
a
thing
was
you
have
not
seen
me
dance
then
inquired
the
king
yes
but
i
always
thought
dancers
went
from
easy
to
difficult
acrobatic
feats
i
was
mistaken
all
the
more
greater
reason
therefore
that
i
should
leave
for
a
time
sire
i
repeat
you
have
no
present
occasion
for
my
services
besides
if
your
majesty
should
have
any
need
of
me
you
would
know
where
to
find
very
well
said
the
king
and
he
granted
him
leave
of
absence
we
shall
not
look
for
d
artagnan
therefore
at
fontainebleau
for
to
do
so
would
be
useless
but
with
the
permission
of
our
readers
follow
him
to
the
rue
des
lombards
where
he
was
located
at
the
sign
of
the
pilon
d
or
in
the
house
of
our
old
friend
planchet
it
was
about
eight
o
clock
in
the
evening
and
the
weather
was
exceedingly
warm
there
was
only
one
window
open
and
that
one
belonging
to
a
room
on
the
a
perfume
of
spices
mingled
with
another
perfume
less
exotic
but
more
penetrating
namely
that
which
arose
from
the
street
ascended
to
salute
the
nostrils
of
the
musketeer
d
artagnan
reclining
in
an
immense
chair
with
his
legs
not
stretched
out
but
simply
placed
upon
a
stool
formed
an
angle
of
the
most
obtuse
form
that
could
possibly
be
seen
both
his
arms
were
crossed
over
his
head
his
head
reclining
upon
his
left
shoulder
like
alexander
the
great
his
eyes
usually
so
quick
and
intelligent
in
their
expression
were
now
and
seemed
fastened
as
it
were
upon
a
small
corner
of
blue
sky
that
was
visible
behind
the
opening
of
the
chimneys
there
was
just
enough
blue
and
no
more
to
fill
one
of
the
sacks
of
lentils
or
haricots
which
formed
the
principal
furniture
of
the
shop
on
the
ground
floor
thus
extended
at
his
ease
and
sheltered
in
his
place
of
observation
behind
the
window
d
artagnan
seemed
as
if
he
had
ceased
to
be
a
soldier
as
if
he
were
no
longer
an
officer
belonging
to
the
palace
but
was
on
the
contrary
a
quiet
citizen
in
a
state
of
stagnation
between
his
dinner
and
supper
or
between
his
supper
and
his
bed
one
of
those
strong
ossified
brains
which
have
no
more
room
for
a
single
idea
so
fiercely
does
animal
matter
keep
watch
at
the
doors
of
intelligence
narrowly
inspecting
the
contraband
trade
which
might
result
from
the
introduction
into
the
brain
of
a
symptom
of
thought
we
have
already
said
night
was
closing
in
the
shops
were
being
lighted
while
the
windows
of
the
upper
apartments
were
being
closed
and
the
rhythmic
steps
of
a
patrol
of
soldiers
forming
the
night
watch
could
be
heard
retreating
d
artagnan
continued
however
to
think
of
nothing
except
the
blue
corner
of
the
sky
a
few
paces
from
him
completely
in
the
shade
lying
on
his
stomach
upon
a
sack
of
indian
corn
was
planchet
with
both
his
arms
under
his
chin
and
his
eyes
fixed
on
d
artagnan
who
was
either
thinking
dreaming
or
sleeping
with
his
eyes
open
planchet
had
been
watching
him
for
a
tolerably
long
time
and
by
way
of
interruption
he
began
by
exclaiming
hum
hum
but
d
artagnan
did
not
stir
planchet
then
saw
that
it
was
necessary
to
have
recourse
to
more
effectual
means
still
after
a
prolonged
reflection
on
the
subject
the
most
ingenious
means
that
suggested
itself
to
him
under
the
present
circumstances
was
to
let
himself
roll
off
the
sack
on
to
the
floor
murmuring
at
the
same
time
against
himself
the
word
but
notwithstanding
the
noise
produced
by
planchet
s
fall
d
artagnan
who
had
in
the
course
of
his
existence
heard
many
other
and
very
different
falls
did
not
appear
to
pay
the
least
attention
to
the
present
one
besides
an
enormous
cart
laden
with
stones
passing
from
the
rue
absorbed
in
the
noise
of
its
wheels
the
noise
of
planchet
s
tumble
and
yet
planchet
fancied
that
in
token
of
tacit
approval
he
saw
him
imperceptibly
smile
at
the
word
this
emboldened
him
to
say
are
you
asleep
monsieur
d
artagnan
no
planchet
i
am
not
asleep
replied
the
musketeer
i
am
in
despair
said
planchet
to
hear
such
a
word
as
well
and
why
not
is
it
not
a
grammatical
word
monsieur
planchet
of
course
monsieur
d
well
well
then
the
word
distresses
me
beyond
tell
me
why
you
are
distressed
planchet
said
d
artagnan
if
you
say
that
you
are
not
asleep
it
is
as
much
as
to
say
that
you
have
not
even
the
consolation
of
being
able
to
sleep
or
better
still
it
is
precisely
the
same
as
telling
me
that
you
are
getting
bored
to
planchet
you
know
that
i
am
never
except
and
the
day
before
bah
monsieur
d
artagnan
it
is
a
week
since
you
returned
here
from
fontainebleau
in
other
words
you
have
no
longer
your
orders
to
issue
or
your
men
to
review
and
maneuver
you
need
the
sound
of
guns
drums
and
all
that
din
and
confusion
i
who
have
myself
carried
a
musket
can
easily
believe
planchet
replied
d
artagnan
i
assure
you
i
am
not
bored
in
the
least
in
the
in
that
case
what
are
you
doing
lying
there
as
if
you
were
dead
my
dear
planchet
there
was
once
upon
a
time
at
the
siege
of
la
rochelle
when
i
was
there
when
you
were
there
when
we
both
were
there
a
certain
arab
who
was
celebrated
for
the
manner
in
which
he
adjusted
culverins
he
was
a
clever
fellow
although
of
a
very
odd
complexion
which
was
the
same
color
as
your
olives
well
this
arab
whenever
he
had
done
eating
or
working
used
to
sit
down
to
rest
himself
as
i
am
resting
myself
now
and
smoked
i
can
not
tell
you
what
sort
of
magical
leaves
in
a
large
tube
and
if
any
officers
happening
to
pass
reproached
him
for
being
always
asleep
he
used
quietly
to
reply
better
to
sit
down
than
to
stand
up
to
lie
down
than
to
sit
down
to
be
dead
than
to
lie
he
was
an
acutely
melancholy
arab
and
i
remember
him
perfectly
well
form
the
color
of
his
skin
and
the
style
of
his
conversation
he
used
to
cut
off
the
heads
of
protestants
with
the
most
singular
gusto
precisely
and
then
used
to
embalm
them
when
they
were
worth
the
trouble
and
when
he
was
thus
engaged
with
his
herbs
and
plants
about
him
he
looked
like
a
making
you
are
quite
right
planchet
he
oh
i
can
remember
things
very
well
at
times
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
but
what
do
you
think
of
his
mode
of
reasoning
i
think
it
good
in
one
sense
but
very
stupid
in
expound
your
meaning
well
monsieur
in
point
of
fact
then
better
to
sit
down
than
to
stand
up
is
plain
enough
especially
when
one
may
be
fatigued
and
planchet
smiled
in
a
roguish
way
as
for
better
to
be
lying
down
let
that
pass
but
as
for
the
last
proposition
that
it
is
better
to
be
dead
than
alive
it
is
in
my
opinion
very
absurd
my
own
undoubted
preference
being
for
my
bed
and
if
you
are
not
of
my
opinion
it
is
simply
as
i
have
already
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
because
you
are
boring
yourself
to
planchet
do
you
know
la
fontaine
the
chemist
at
the
corner
of
the
rue
no
the
writer
of
oh
corbeau
exactly
well
then
i
am
like
his
he
has
got
a
hare
also
then
he
has
all
sorts
of
well
what
does
his
hare
do
then
m
la
fontaine
s
hare
ah
ah
planchet
i
am
like
that
hare
i
am
you
are
thinking
you
say
said
planchet
uneasily
yes
your
house
is
dull
enough
to
drive
people
to
think
you
will
admit
that
i
and
yet
monsieur
you
have
a
upon
the
yes
and
wonderfully
interesting
that
is
of
but
it
is
no
less
true
monsieur
that
if
you
were
living
at
the
back
of
the
house
you
would
bore
yourself
i
mean
you
would
think
more
than
upon
my
word
planchet
i
hardly
know
still
said
the
grocer
if
your
reflections
are
at
all
like
those
which
led
you
to
restore
king
charles
and
planchet
finished
by
a
little
laugh
which
was
not
without
its
meaning
ah
planchet
my
friend
returned
d
artagnan
you
are
getting
is
there
no
other
king
to
be
restored
d
artagnan
no
second
monk
to
be
packed
up
like
a
salted
hog
in
a
deal
box
no
my
dear
planchet
all
the
kings
are
seated
on
their
respective
thrones
less
comfortably
so
perhaps
than
i
am
upon
this
chair
but
at
all
events
there
they
and
d
artagnan
sighed
deeply
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
planchet
you
are
making
me
very
you
are
very
good
i
begin
to
suspect
what
is
it
monsieur
d
artagnan
you
are
getting
oh
said
d
artagnan
striking
his
chest
which
sounded
like
an
empty
cuirass
it
is
impossible
ah
said
planchet
slightly
overcome
if
you
were
to
get
thin
in
my
house
well
i
should
do
something
what
would
you
do
tell
i
should
look
out
for
the
man
who
was
the
cause
of
all
your
ah
according
to
your
account
i
am
anxious
yes
you
are
anxious
and
you
are
getting
thin
visibly
getting
thin
if
you
go
on
getting
thin
in
this
way
i
will
take
my
sword
in
my
hand
and
go
straight
to
d
herblay
and
have
it
out
with
what
said
d
artagnan
starting
in
his
chair
what
s
that
you
say
and
what
has
d
herblay
s
name
to
do
with
your
groceries
just
as
you
please
get
angry
if
you
like
or
call
me
names
if
you
prefer
it
but
the
deuce
is
in
it
know
what
i
d
artagnan
had
during
this
second
outburst
of
planchet
s
so
placed
himself
as
not
to
lose
a
single
look
of
his
face
that
is
he
sat
with
both
his
hands
resting
on
both
his
knees
and
his
head
stretched
out
towards
the
grocer
come
explain
yourself
he
said
and
tell
me
how
you
could
possibly
utter
such
a
blasphemy
d
herblay
your
old
master
my
friend
an
ecclesiastic
a
musketeer
turned
bishop
do
you
mean
to
say
you
would
raise
your
sword
against
him
planchet
i
could
raise
my
sword
against
my
own
father
when
i
see
you
in
such
a
state
as
you
are
m
d
herblay
a
gentleman
it
s
all
the
same
to
me
whether
he
s
a
gentleman
or
not
he
gives
you
the
blue
devils
that
is
all
i
know
and
the
blue
devils
make
people
get
thin
i
have
no
notion
of
d
artagnan
leaving
my
house
thinner
than
when
he
entered
how
does
he
give
me
the
blue
devils
as
you
call
it
come
explain
you
have
had
the
nightmare
during
the
last
three
i
yes
you
and
in
your
nightmare
you
called
out
several
times
aramis
deceitful
aramis
ah
i
said
that
did
i
murmured
d
artagnan
uneasily
yes
those
very
words
upon
my
well
what
else
you
know
the
saying
planchet
dreams
go
by
not
so
for
every
time
during
the
last
three
days
when
you
went
out
you
have
not
once
failed
to
ask
me
on
your
return
have
you
seen
d
herblay
or
else
have
you
received
any
letters
for
me
from
d
herblay
well
it
is
very
natural
i
should
take
an
interest
in
my
old
friend
said
d
artagnan
of
course
but
not
to
such
an
extent
as
to
get
thin
on
that
planchet
i
ll
get
fatter
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
i
very
well
monsieur
i
accept
it
for
i
know
that
when
you
give
your
word
of
honor
it
is
i
will
not
dream
of
aramis
any
more
and
i
will
never
ask
you
again
if
there
are
any
letters
from
d
herblay
but
on
condition
that
you
explain
one
thing
to
tell
me
what
it
is
monsieur
i
am
a
great
observer
and
just
now
you
made
use
of
a
very
singular
oath
which
is
unusual
for
you
mean
i
suppose
it
is
the
oath
i
have
used
ever
since
i
have
been
a
very
proper
too
it
is
the
name
of
a
dried
grape
or
raisin
i
believe
it
is
my
most
ferocious
oath
when
i
have
once
said
i
am
a
man
no
still
i
never
knew
you
use
that
oath
very
likely
not
monsieur
i
had
a
present
made
me
of
it
said
planchet
and
as
he
pronounced
these
words
he
winked
his
eye
with
a
cunning
expression
which
thoroughly
awakened
d
artagnan
s
attention
come
come
why
i
am
not
like
you
monsieur
said
planchet
i
don
t
pass
my
life
in
you
do
wrong
i
mean
in
boring
myself
to
death
we
have
but
a
very
short
time
to
live
why
not
make
the
best
of
it
you
are
an
epicurean
philosopher
i
begin
to
think
why
not
my
hand
is
still
as
steady
as
ever
i
can
write
and
can
weigh
out
my
sugar
and
spices
my
foot
is
firm
i
can
dance
and
walk
about
my
stomach
has
its
teeth
still
for
i
eat
and
digest
very
well
my
heart
is
not
quite
hardened
well
monsieur
well
what
planchet
why
you
see
said
the
grocer
rubbing
his
hands
together
d
artagnan
crossed
one
leg
over
the
other
and
said
planchet
my
friend
i
am
unnerved
with
extreme
surprise
for
you
are
revealing
yourself
to
me
under
a
perfectly
new
planchet
flattered
in
the
highest
degree
by
this
remark
continued
to
rub
his
hands
very
hard
together
ah
ah
he
said
because
i
happen
to
be
only
slow
you
think
me
perhaps
a
positive
very
good
planchet
very
well
follow
my
idea
monsieur
if
you
please
i
said
to
myself
continued
planchet
that
without
enjoyment
there
is
no
happiness
on
this
quite
true
what
you
say
planchet
interrupted
d
artagnan
at
all
events
if
we
can
not
obtain
pleasure
for
pleasure
is
not
so
common
a
thing
after
all
let
us
at
least
get
consolations
of
some
kind
or
and
so
you
console
yourself
exactly
tell
me
how
you
console
i
put
on
a
buckler
for
the
purpose
of
confronting
i
place
my
time
at
the
direction
of
patience
and
on
the
very
eve
of
feeling
i
am
going
to
get
bored
i
amuse
and
you
don
t
find
any
difficulty
in
that
and
you
found
it
out
quite
by
yourself
quite
it
is
what
do
you
say
i
say
that
your
philosophy
is
not
to
be
matched
in
the
christian
or
pagan
world
in
modern
days
or
in
antiquity
you
think
so
follow
my
example
it
is
a
very
tempting
do
as
i
i
could
not
wish
for
anything
better
but
all
minds
are
not
of
the
same
stamp
and
it
might
possibly
happen
that
if
i
were
required
to
amuse
myself
in
the
manner
you
do
i
should
bore
myself
bah
at
least
try
well
tell
me
what
you
have
you
observed
that
i
leave
home
occasionally
in
any
particular
way
that
s
the
very
thing
you
have
noticed
it
then
my
dear
planchet
you
must
understand
that
when
people
see
each
other
every
day
and
one
of
the
two
absents
himself
the
other
misses
him
do
you
not
feel
the
want
of
my
society
when
i
am
in
the
country
prodigiously
that
is
to
say
i
feel
like
a
body
without
a
that
being
understood
then
what
are
the
periods
when
i
absent
myself
on
the
fifteenth
and
thirtieth
of
every
and
i
remain
away
sometimes
two
sometimes
three
and
sometimes
four
days
at
a
have
you
ever
given
it
a
thought
why
i
was
absent
to
look
after
your
debts
i
and
when
i
returned
how
did
you
think
i
looked
as
far
as
my
face
was
concerned
exceedingly
you
admit
you
say
that
i
always
look
satisfied
and
what
have
you
attributed
my
satisfaction
to
that
your
business
was
going
on
very
well
that
your
purchases
of
rice
prunes
raw
sugar
dried
apples
pears
and
treacle
were
advantageous
you
were
always
very
picturesque
in
your
notions
and
ideas
planchet
and
i
was
not
in
the
slightest
degree
surprised
to
find
you
had
selected
grocery
as
an
occupation
which
is
of
all
trades
the
most
varied
and
the
very
pleasantest
as
far
as
the
character
is
concerned
inasmuch
as
one
handles
so
many
natural
and
perfumed
perfectly
true
monsieur
but
you
are
very
greatly
in
what
way
in
thinking
that
i
leave
here
every
fortnight
to
collect
my
money
or
to
make
purchases
ho
ho
how
could
you
possibly
have
thought
such
a
thing
ho
ho
ho
and
planchet
began
to
laugh
in
a
manner
that
inspired
d
artagnan
with
very
serious
misgivings
as
to
his
sanity
i
confess
said
the
musketeer
that
i
do
not
precisely
catch
your
very
true
what
do
you
mean
by
very
true
it
must
be
true
since
you
say
it
but
pray
be
assured
that
it
in
no
way
lessens
my
opinion
of
ah
that
is
no
you
are
a
man
of
genius
and
whenever
the
question
happens
to
be
of
war
tactics
surprises
or
good
honest
blows
to
be
dealt
with
why
kings
are
marionettes
compared
to
you
but
for
the
consolations
of
the
mind
the
proper
care
of
the
body
the
agreeable
things
of
like
if
one
may
say
so
ah
monsieur
don
t
talk
to
me
about
men
of
genius
they
are
nothing
short
of
good
said
d
artagnan
really
fidgety
with
curiosity
upon
my
word
you
interest
me
in
the
highest
you
feel
already
less
bored
than
you
did
just
now
do
you
not
i
was
not
bored
yet
since
you
have
been
talking
to
me
i
feel
more
very
good
then
that
is
not
a
bad
beginning
i
will
cure
you
rely
upon
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
will
you
let
me
try
then
immediately
if
you
very
well
have
you
any
horses
here
yes
ten
twenty
oh
there
is
no
occasion
for
so
many
as
that
two
will
be
quite
they
are
quite
at
your
disposal
very
good
then
i
shall
carry
you
off
with
when
where
ah
you
are
asking
too
you
will
admit
however
that
it
is
important
i
should
know
where
i
am
do
you
like
the
country
only
moderately
in
that
case
you
like
town
better
that
is
as
may
very
well
i
am
going
to
take
you
to
a
place
half
town
and
half
to
a
place
where
i
am
sure
you
will
amuse
is
it
possible
yes
and
more
wonderful
still
to
a
place
from
which
you
have
just
returned
for
the
purpose
only
it
would
seem
of
getting
bored
it
is
to
fontainebleau
you
are
going
then
exactly
to
and
in
heaven
s
name
what
are
you
going
to
do
at
fontainebleau
planchet
answered
d
artagnan
by
a
wink
full
of
sly
humor
you
have
some
property
there
you
oh
a
very
paltry
affair
a
little
bit
of
a
house
nothing
i
understand
but
it
is
tolerable
enough
after
i
am
going
to
planchet
s
exclaimed
d
artagnan
whenever
you
did
we
not
fix
let
us
say
if
you
like
and
then
besides
is
the
that
is
to
say
the
day
before
the
one
when
i
am
afraid
of
getting
bored
so
we
will
look
upon
it
as
an
understood
agreed
by
all
you
will
lend
me
one
of
your
horses
the
best
i
no
i
prefer
the
gentlest
of
all
i
never
was
a
very
good
rider
as
you
know
and
in
my
grocery
business
i
have
got
more
awkward
than
ever
besides
besides
what
why
added
planchet
i
do
not
wish
to
fatigue
why
so
d
artagnan
ventured
to
ask
because
i
should
lose
half
the
pleasure
i
expect
to
enjoy
replied
planchet
and
thereupon
he
rose
from
his
sack
of
indian
corn
stretching
himself
and
making
all
his
bones
crack
one
after
the
other
with
a
sort
of
harmony
planchet
planchet
exclaimed
d
artagnan
i
do
declare
that
there
is
no
sybarite
upon
the
face
of
the
globe
who
can
for
a
moment
be
compared
to
you
oh
planchet
it
is
very
clear
that
we
have
never
yet
eaten
a
ton
of
salt
why
so
monsieur
because
even
now
i
can
scarcely
say
i
know
you
said
d
artagnan
and
because
in
point
of
fact
i
return
to
the
opinion
which
for
a
moment
i
had
formed
of
you
that
day
at
boulogne
when
you
strangled
or
did
so
as
nearly
as
possible
de
wardes
s
valet
lubin
in
plain
language
planchet
that
you
are
a
man
of
great
planchet
began
to
laugh
with
a
laugh
full
of
bade
the
musketeer
and
went
down
to
his
back
shop
which
he
used
as
a
bedroom
d
artagnan
resumed
his
original
position
upon
his
chair
and
his
brow
which
had
been
unruffled
for
a
moment
became
more
pensive
than
ever
he
had
already
forgotten
the
whims
and
dreams
of
planchet
yes
said
he
taking
up
again
the
thread
of
his
thoughts
which
had
been
broken
by
the
whimsical
conversation
in
which
we
have
just
permitted
our
readers
to
participate
yes
yes
those
three
points
include
everything
first
to
ascertain
what
baisemeaux
wanted
with
aramis
secondly
to
learn
why
aramis
does
not
let
me
hear
from
him
and
thirdly
to
ascertain
where
porthos
is
the
whole
mystery
lies
in
these
three
points
since
therefore
continued
d
artagnan
our
friends
tell
us
nothing
we
must
have
recourse
to
our
own
poor
intelligence
i
must
do
what
i
can
or
rather
as
planchet
would
chapter
ii
a
letter
from
baisemeaux
d
artagnan
faithful
to
his
plan
went
the
very
next
morning
to
pay
a
visit
to
de
baisemeaux
it
was
cleaning
up
or
tidying
day
at
the
bastile
the
cannons
were
furbished
up
the
staircases
scraped
and
cleaned
and
the
jailers
seemed
to
be
carefully
engaged
in
polishing
the
very
keys
as
for
the
soldiers
belonging
to
the
garrison
they
were
walking
about
in
different
courtyards
under
the
pretense
that
they
were
clean
enough
the
governor
baisemeaux
received
d
artagnan
with
more
than
ordinary
politeness
but
he
behaved
towards
him
with
so
marked
a
reserve
of
manner
that
all
d
artagnan
s
tact
and
cleverness
could
not
get
a
syllable
out
of
him
the
more
he
kept
himself
within
bounds
the
more
d
artagnan
s
suspicion
increased
the
latter
even
fancied
he
remarked
that
the
governor
was
acting
under
the
influence
of
a
recent
recommendation
baisemeaux
had
not
been
at
the
palais
royal
with
d
artagnan
the
same
cold
and
impenetrable
man
which
the
latter
now
found
in
the
baisemeaux
of
the
bastile
when
d
artagnan
wished
to
make
him
talk
about
the
urgent
money
matters
which
had
brought
baisemeaux
in
search
of
d
artagnan
and
had
rendered
him
expansive
notwithstanding
what
had
passed
on
that
evening
baisemeaux
pretended
that
he
had
some
orders
to
give
in
the
prison
and
left
d
artagnan
so
long
alone
waiting
for
him
that
our
musketeer
feeling
sure
that
he
should
not
get
another
syllable
out
of
him
left
the
bastile
without
waiting
until
baisemeaux
returned
from
his
inspection
but
d
artagnan
s
suspicions
were
aroused
and
when
once
that
was
the
case
d
artagnan
could
not
sleep
or
remain
quiet
for
a
moment
he
was
among
men
what
the
cat
is
among
quadrupeds
the
emblem
of
anxiety
and
impatience
at
the
same
moment
a
restless
cat
can
no
more
remain
the
same
place
than
a
silk
thread
wafted
idly
to
and
fro
with
every
breath
of
air
a
cat
on
the
watch
is
as
motionless
as
death
stationed
at
its
place
of
observation
and
neither
hunger
nor
thirst
can
draw
it
from
its
meditations
d
artagnan
who
was
burning
with
impatience
suddenly
threw
aside
the
feeling
like
a
cloak
which
he
felt
too
heavy
on
his
shoulders
and
said
to
himself
that
that
which
they
were
concealing
from
him
was
the
very
thing
it
was
important
he
should
know
and
consequently
he
reasoned
that
baisemeaux
would
not
fail
to
put
aramis
on
his
guard
if
aramis
had
given
him
any
particular
recommendation
and
this
was
in
fact
the
very
thing
that
happened
baisemeaux
had
hardly
had
time
to
return
from
the
donjon
than
d
artagnan
placed
himself
in
ambuscade
close
to
the
rue
de
so
as
to
see
every
one
who
might
leave
the
gates
of
the
bastile
after
he
had
spent
an
hour
on
the
from
the
golden
portcullis
under
the
of
which
he
could
keep
himself
a
little
in
the
shade
d
artagnan
observed
a
soldier
leave
the
bastile
this
was
indeed
the
surest
indication
he
could
possibly
have
wished
for
as
every
jailer
or
warder
has
certain
days
and
even
certain
hours
for
leaving
the
bastile
since
all
are
alike
prohibited
from
having
either
wives
or
lodgings
in
the
castle
and
can
accordingly
leave
without
exciting
any
curiosity
but
a
soldier
once
in
barracks
is
kept
there
for
four
and
twenty
hours
when
on
duty
and
no
one
knew
this
better
than
d
artagnan
the
guardsman
in
question
therefore
was
not
likely
to
leave
his
regimentals
except
on
an
express
and
urgent
order
the
soldier
we
were
saying
left
the
bastile
at
a
slow
and
lounging
pace
like
a
happy
mortal
in
fact
who
instead
of
mounting
sentry
before
a
wearisome
or
upon
a
bastion
no
less
wearisome
has
the
good
luck
to
get
a
little
liberty
in
addition
to
a
walk
both
pleasures
being
luckily
reckoned
as
part
of
his
time
on
duty
he
bent
his
steps
towards
the
faubourg
enjoying
the
fresh
air
and
the
warmth
of
the
sun
and
looking
at
all
the
pretty
faces
he
passed
d
artagnan
followed
him
at
a
distance
he
had
not
yet
arranged
his
ideas
as
what
was
to
be
done
i
must
first
of
all
he
thought
see
the
fellow
s
face
a
man
seen
is
a
man
d
artagnan
increased
his
pace
and
which
was
not
very
difficult
by
the
by
soon
got
in
advance
of
the
soldier
not
only
did
he
observe
that
his
face
showed
a
tolerable
amount
of
intelligence
and
resolution
but
he
noticed
also
that
his
nose
was
a
little
red
he
has
a
weakness
for
brandy
i
see
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
at
the
same
moment
that
he
remarked
his
red
nose
he
saw
that
the
soldier
had
a
white
paper
in
his
belt
good
he
has
a
letter
added
d
artagnan
the
only
difficulty
was
to
get
hold
of
the
letter
but
a
common
soldier
would
of
course
be
only
too
delighted
at
having
been
selected
by
de
baisemeaux
as
a
special
messenger
and
would
not
be
likely
to
sell
his
message
as
d
artagnan
was
biting
his
nails
the
soldier
continued
to
advance
more
and
more
into
the
faubourg
he
is
certainly
going
to
he
said
to
himself
and
i
shall
not
be
able
to
learn
what
the
letter
it
was
enough
to
drive
him
wild
if
i
were
in
uniform
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
i
would
have
this
fellow
seized
and
his
letter
with
him
i
could
easily
get
assistance
at
the
very
first
but
the
devil
take
me
if
i
mention
my
name
in
an
affair
of
this
kind
if
i
were
to
treat
him
to
something
to
drink
his
suspicions
would
be
roused
and
besides
he
might
drink
me
drunk
my
wits
seem
to
have
left
me
said
d
artagnan
it
is
all
over
with
me
yet
supposing
i
were
to
attack
this
poor
devil
make
him
draw
his
sword
and
kill
him
for
the
sake
of
his
letter
no
harm
in
that
if
it
were
a
question
of
a
letter
from
a
queen
to
a
nobleman
or
a
letter
from
a
cardinal
to
a
queen
but
what
miserable
intrigues
are
those
of
messieurs
aramis
and
fouquet
with
colbert
a
man
s
life
for
that
no
no
indeed
not
even
ten
as
he
philosophized
in
this
manner
biting
first
his
nails
and
then
his
mustaches
he
perceived
a
group
of
archers
and
a
commissary
of
the
police
engaged
in
carrying
away
a
man
of
very
gentlemanly
exterior
who
was
struggling
with
all
his
might
against
them
the
archers
had
torn
his
clothes
and
were
dragging
him
roughly
away
he
begged
they
would
lead
him
along
more
respectfully
asserting
that
he
was
a
gentleman
and
a
soldier
and
observing
our
soldier
walking
in
the
street
he
called
out
help
the
soldier
walked
on
with
the
same
step
towards
the
man
who
had
called
out
to
him
followed
by
the
crowd
an
idea
suddenly
occurred
to
d
artagnan
it
was
his
first
one
and
we
shall
find
it
was
not
a
bad
one
either
during
the
time
the
gentleman
was
relating
to
the
soldier
that
he
had
just
been
seized
in
a
house
as
a
thief
when
the
truth
was
he
was
only
there
as
a
lover
and
while
the
soldier
was
pitying
him
and
offering
him
consolation
and
advice
with
that
gravity
which
a
french
soldier
has
always
ready
whenever
his
vanity
or
his
de
is
concerned
d
artagnan
glided
behind
the
soldier
who
was
closely
hemmed
in
by
the
crowd
and
with
a
rapid
sweep
like
a
sabre
slash
snatched
the
letter
from
his
belt
as
at
this
moment
the
gentleman
with
the
torn
clothes
was
pulling
about
the
soldier
to
show
how
the
commissary
of
police
had
pulled
him
about
d
artagnan
effected
his
pillage
of
the
letter
without
the
slightest
interference
he
stationed
himself
about
ten
paces
distant
behind
the
pillar
of
an
adjoining
house
and
read
on
the
address
to
monsieur
du
vallon
at
monsieur
fouquet
s
good
he
said
and
then
he
unsealed
without
tearing
the
letter
drew
out
the
paper
which
was
folded
in
four
from
the
inside
which
contained
only
these
words
dear
monsieur
du
vallon
will
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
monsieur
d
herblay
that
has
been
to
the
bastile
and
has
been
making
inquiries
your
devoted
de
very
good
all
right
exclaimed
d
artagnan
it
is
clear
enough
now
porthos
is
engaged
in
being
now
satisfied
of
what
he
wished
to
know
thought
the
musketeer
what
is
to
be
done
with
that
poor
devil
of
a
soldier
that
cunning
fellow
de
baisemeaux
will
make
him
pay
dearly
for
my
trick
if
he
returns
without
the
letter
what
will
they
do
to
him
besides
i
don
t
want
the
letter
when
the
egg
has
been
sucked
what
is
the
good
of
the
shell
d
artagnan
perceived
that
the
commissary
and
the
archers
had
succeeded
in
convincing
the
soldier
and
went
on
their
way
with
the
prisoner
the
latter
being
still
surrounded
by
the
crowd
and
continuing
his
complaints
d
artagnan
advanced
into
the
very
middle
of
the
crowd
let
the
letter
fall
without
any
one
having
observed
him
and
then
retreated
rapidly
the
soldier
resumed
his
route
towards
his
mind
occupied
with
the
gentleman
who
had
implored
his
protection
suddenly
he
thought
of
his
letter
and
looking
at
his
belt
saw
that
it
was
no
longer
there
d
artagnan
derived
no
little
satisfaction
from
his
sudden
terrified
cry
the
poor
soldier
in
the
greatest
anguish
of
mind
looked
round
him
on
every
side
and
at
last
about
twenty
paces
behind
him
he
perceived
the
lucky
envelope
he
pounced
on
it
like
a
falcon
on
its
prey
the
envelope
was
certainly
a
little
dirty
and
rather
crumpled
but
at
all
events
the
letter
itself
was
found
d
artagnan
observed
that
the
broken
seal
attracted
the
soldier
s
attention
a
good
deal
but
he
finished
apparently
by
consoling
himself
and
returned
the
letter
to
his
belt
go
on
said
d
artagnan
i
have
plenty
of
time
before
me
so
you
may
precede
me
it
appears
that
aramis
is
not
in
paris
since
baisemeaux
writes
to
porthos
dear
porthos
how
delighted
i
shall
be
to
see
him
again
and
to
have
some
conversation
with
him
said
the
gascon
and
regulating
his
pace
according
to
that
of
the
soldier
he
promised
himself
to
arrive
a
quarter
of
an
hour
after
him
at
fouquet
s
chapter
iii
in
which
the
reader
will
be
delighted
to
find
that
porthos
has
lost
nothing
of
his
muscularity
d
artagnan
had
according
to
his
usual
style
calculated
that
every
hour
is
worth
sixty
minutes
and
every
minute
worth
sixty
seconds
thanks
to
this
perfectly
exact
calculation
of
minutes
and
seconds
he
reached
the
superintendent
s
door
at
the
very
moment
the
soldier
was
leaving
it
with
his
belt
empty
d
artagnan
presented
himself
at
the
door
which
a
porter
with
a
profusely
embroidered
livery
held
half
opened
for
him
d
artagnan
would
very
much
have
liked
to
enter
without
giving
his
name
but
this
was
impossible
and
so
he
gave
it
notwithstanding
this
concession
which
ought
to
have
removed
every
difficulty
in
the
way
at
least
d
artagnan
thought
so
the
hesitated
however
at
the
second
repetition
of
the
title
captain
of
the
king
s
guards
the
without
quite
leaving
the
passage
clear
for
him
ceased
to
bar
it
completely
d
artagnan
understood
that
orders
of
the
most
positive
character
had
been
given
he
decided
therefore
to
tell
a
falsehood
a
circumstance
moreover
which
did
not
seriously
affect
his
peace
of
mind
when
he
saw
that
beyond
the
falsehood
the
safety
of
the
state
itself
or
even
purely
and
simply
his
own
individual
personal
interest
might
be
at
stake
he
moreover
added
to
the
declarations
he
had
already
made
that
the
soldier
sent
to
du
vallon
was
his
own
messenger
and
that
the
only
object
that
letter
had
in
view
was
to
announce
his
intended
arrival
from
that
moment
no
one
opposed
d
artagnan
s
entrance
any
further
and
he
entered
accordingly
a
valet
wished
to
accompany
him
but
he
answered
that
it
was
useless
to
take
that
trouble
on
his
account
inasmuch
as
he
knew
perfectly
well
where
du
vallon
was
there
was
nothing
of
course
to
say
to
a
man
so
thoroughly
and
completely
informed
on
all
points
and
d
artagnan
was
permitted
therefore
to
do
as
he
liked
the
terraces
the
magnificent
apartments
the
gardens
were
all
reviewed
and
narrowly
inspected
by
the
musketeer
he
walked
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
in
this
more
than
royal
residence
which
included
as
many
wonders
as
articles
of
furniture
and
as
many
servants
as
there
were
columns
and
doors
decidedly
he
said
to
himself
this
mansion
has
no
other
limits
than
the
pillars
of
the
habitable
world
is
it
probable
porthos
has
taken
it
into
his
head
to
go
back
to
pierrefonds
without
even
leaving
fouquet
s
house
he
finally
reached
a
remote
part
of
the
chateau
inclosed
by
a
stone
wall
which
was
covered
with
a
profusion
of
thick
plants
luxuriant
in
blossoms
as
large
and
solid
as
fruit
at
equal
distances
on
the
top
of
this
wall
were
placed
various
statues
in
timid
or
mysterious
attitudes
these
were
vestals
hidden
beneath
the
long
greek
peplum
with
its
thick
sinuous
folds
agile
nymphs
covered
with
their
marble
veils
and
guarding
the
palace
with
their
fugitive
glances
a
statue
of
hermes
with
his
finger
on
his
lips
one
of
iris
with
extended
wings
another
of
night
sprinkled
all
over
with
poppies
dominated
the
gardens
and
outbuildings
which
could
be
seen
through
the
trees
all
these
statues
threw
in
white
relief
their
profiles
upon
the
dark
ground
of
the
tall
cypresses
which
darted
their
somber
summits
towards
the
sky
around
these
cypresses
were
entwined
climbing
roses
whose
flowering
rings
were
fastened
to
every
fork
of
the
branches
and
spread
over
the
lower
boughs
and
the
various
statues
showers
of
flowers
of
the
rarest
fragrance
these
enchantments
seemed
to
the
musketeer
the
result
of
the
greatest
efforts
of
the
human
mind
he
felt
in
a
dreamy
almost
poetical
frame
of
mind
the
idea
that
porthos
was
living
in
so
perfect
an
eden
gave
him
a
higher
idea
of
porthos
showing
how
tremendously
true
it
is
that
even
the
very
highest
orders
of
minds
are
not
quite
exempt
from
the
influence
of
surroundings
d
artagnan
found
the
door
and
on
or
rather
in
the
door
a
kind
of
spring
which
he
detected
having
touched
it
the
door
flew
open
d
artagnan
entered
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
advanced
into
a
pavilion
built
in
a
circular
form
in
which
no
other
sound
could
be
heard
but
cascades
and
the
songs
of
birds
at
the
door
of
the
pavilion
he
met
a
lackey
it
is
here
i
believe
said
d
artagnan
without
hesitation
that
le
baron
du
vallon
is
staying
yes
monsieur
answered
the
lackey
have
the
goodness
to
tell
him
that
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
captain
of
the
king
s
musketeers
is
waiting
to
see
d
artagnan
was
introduced
into
the
and
had
not
long
to
remain
in
expectation
a
step
shook
the
floor
of
the
adjoining
room
a
door
opened
or
rather
flew
open
and
porthos
appeared
and
threw
himself
into
his
friend
s
arms
with
a
sort
of
embarrassment
which
did
not
ill
become
him
you
here
he
exclaimed
and
you
replied
d
artagnan
ah
you
sly
fellow
yes
said
porthos
with
a
somewhat
embarrassed
smile
yes
you
see
i
am
staying
in
fouquet
s
house
at
which
you
are
not
a
little
surprised
i
suppose
not
at
all
why
should
you
not
be
one
of
fouquet
s
friends
fouquet
has
a
very
large
number
particularly
among
clever
porthos
had
the
modesty
not
to
take
the
compliment
to
himself
besides
he
added
you
saw
me
at
a
greater
reason
for
my
believing
you
to
be
one
of
fouquet
s
the
fact
is
i
am
acquainted
with
him
said
porthos
with
a
certain
embarrassment
of
manner
ah
friend
porthos
said
d
artagnan
how
treacherously
you
have
behaved
towards
in
what
way
exclaimed
porthos
what
you
complete
so
admirable
a
work
as
the
fortifications
of
and
you
did
not
tell
me
of
it
porthos
colored
nay
more
than
that
continued
d
artagnan
you
saw
me
out
yonder
you
know
i
am
in
the
king
s
service
and
yet
you
could
not
guess
that
the
king
jealously
desirous
of
learning
the
name
of
the
man
whose
abilities
had
wrought
a
work
of
which
he
heard
the
most
wonderful
accounts
you
could
not
guess
i
say
that
the
king
sent
me
to
learn
who
this
man
was
what
the
king
sent
you
to
learn
of
course
but
don
t
let
us
speak
of
that
any
not
speak
of
it
said
porthos
on
the
contrary
we
will
speak
of
it
and
so
the
king
knew
that
we
were
fortifying
of
course
does
not
the
king
know
everything
but
he
did
not
know
who
was
fortifying
it
no
he
only
suspected
from
what
he
had
been
told
of
the
nature
of
the
works
that
it
was
some
celebrated
soldier
or
the
devil
said
porthos
if
i
had
only
known
that
you
would
not
have
run
away
from
vannes
as
you
did
perhaps
no
what
did
you
say
when
you
couldn
t
find
me
my
dear
fellow
i
ah
indeed
you
reflect
do
you
well
and
what
did
that
reflection
lead
to
it
led
me
to
guess
the
whole
come
then
tell
me
what
did
you
guess
after
all
said
porthos
settling
himself
into
an
armchair
and
assuming
the
airs
of
a
sphinx
i
guessed
in
the
first
place
that
you
were
fortifying
there
was
no
great
difficulty
in
that
for
you
saw
me
at
wait
a
minute
i
also
guessed
something
else
that
you
were
fortifying
by
fouquet
s
that
s
but
even
that
is
not
all
whenever
i
feel
myself
in
trim
for
guessing
i
do
not
stop
on
my
road
and
so
i
guessed
that
fouquet
wished
to
preserve
the
most
absolute
secrecy
respecting
these
i
believe
that
was
his
intention
in
fact
said
porthos
yes
but
do
you
know
why
he
wished
to
keep
it
secret
in
order
it
should
not
become
known
perhaps
said
porthos
that
was
his
principal
reason
but
his
wish
was
subservient
to
a
bit
of
generosity
in
fact
said
porthos
i
have
heard
it
said
that
fouquet
was
a
very
generous
to
a
bit
of
generosity
he
wished
to
exhibit
towards
the
oh
oh
you
seem
surprised
at
that
and
you
didn
t
guess
well
i
know
it
you
are
a
not
at
all
i
assure
how
do
you
know
it
then
by
a
very
simple
means
i
heard
fouquet
himself
say
so
to
the
say
what
to
the
king
that
he
fortified
on
his
majesty
s
account
and
that
he
had
made
him
a
present
of
belle
and
you
heard
fouquet
say
that
to
the
king
in
those
very
words
he
even
added
has
been
fortified
by
an
engineer
one
of
my
friends
a
man
of
a
great
deal
of
merit
whom
i
shall
ask
your
majesty
s
permission
to
present
to
what
is
his
name
said
the
king
the
baron
du
vallon
fouquet
replied
very
well
returned
his
majesty
you
will
present
him
to
the
king
said
that
upon
the
word
of
a
d
artagnan
oh
oh
said
porthos
why
have
i
not
been
presented
then
have
they
not
spoken
to
you
about
this
presentation
yes
certainly
but
i
am
always
kept
waiting
for
be
easy
it
will
be
sure
to
humph
humph
grumbled
porthos
which
d
artagnan
pretended
not
to
hear
and
changing
the
conversation
he
said
you
seem
to
be
living
in
a
very
solitary
place
here
my
dear
fellow
i
always
preferred
retirement
i
am
of
a
melancholy
disposition
replied
porthos
with
a
sigh
really
that
is
odd
said
d
artagnan
i
never
remarked
that
it
is
only
since
i
have
taken
to
reading
said
porthos
with
a
thoughtful
air
but
the
labors
of
the
mind
have
not
affected
the
health
of
the
body
i
trust
not
in
the
slightest
your
strength
is
as
great
as
ever
too
great
my
friend
too
ah
i
had
heard
that
for
a
short
time
after
your
arrival
that
i
could
hardly
move
a
limb
i
suppose
how
was
it
said
d
artagnan
smiling
and
why
was
it
you
could
not
move
porthos
perceiving
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
wished
to
correct
it
yes
i
came
from
upon
very
hard
horses
he
said
and
that
fatigued
i
am
no
longer
astonished
then
since
i
who
followed
you
found
seven
or
eight
lying
dead
on
the
i
am
very
heavy
you
know
said
porthos
so
that
you
were
bruised
all
my
marrow
melted
and
that
made
me
very
poor
porthos
but
how
did
aramis
act
towards
you
under
those
circumstances
very
well
indeed
he
had
me
attended
to
by
fouquet
s
own
doctor
but
just
imagine
at
the
end
of
a
week
i
could
not
breathe
any
what
do
you
mean
the
room
was
too
small
i
had
absorbed
every
atom
of
indeed
i
was
told
so
at
least
and
so
i
was
removed
into
another
where
you
were
able
to
breathe
i
hope
and
trust
yes
more
freely
but
no
exercise
nothing
to
do
the
doctor
pretended
that
i
was
not
to
stir
i
on
the
contrary
felt
that
i
was
stronger
than
ever
that
was
the
cause
of
a
very
serious
what
accident
fancy
my
dear
fellow
that
i
revolted
against
the
directions
of
that
ass
of
a
doctor
and
i
resolved
to
go
out
whether
it
suited
him
or
not
and
consequently
i
told
the
valet
who
waited
on
me
to
bring
me
my
you
were
quite
naked
then
oh
no
on
the
contrary
i
had
a
magnificent
to
wear
the
lackey
obeyed
i
dressed
myself
in
my
own
clothes
which
had
become
too
large
for
me
but
a
strange
circumstance
had
happened
my
feet
had
become
too
yes
i
quite
and
my
boots
too
you
mean
your
feet
were
still
swollen
exactly
you
have
hit
and
is
that
the
accident
you
were
going
to
tell
me
about
oh
yes
i
did
not
make
the
same
reflection
you
have
done
i
said
to
myself
since
my
feet
have
entered
my
boots
ten
times
there
is
no
reason
why
they
should
not
go
in
the
allow
me
to
tell
you
my
dear
porthos
that
on
this
occasion
you
failed
in
your
in
short
then
they
placed
me
opposite
to
a
part
of
the
room
which
was
partitioned
i
tried
to
get
my
boot
on
i
pulled
it
with
my
hands
i
pushed
with
all
the
strength
of
the
muscles
of
my
leg
making
the
most
efforts
when
suddenly
the
two
tags
of
my
boot
remained
in
my
hands
and
my
foot
struck
out
like
a
how
learned
you
are
in
fortification
dear
my
foot
darted
out
like
a
ballista
and
came
against
the
partition
which
it
broke
in
i
really
thought
that
like
samson
i
had
demolished
the
temple
and
the
number
of
pictures
the
quantity
of
china
vases
of
flowers
carpets
and
that
fell
down
were
really
indeed
without
reckoning
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
partition
was
a
small
table
laden
with
porcelain
which
you
knocked
over
which
i
dashed
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
said
porthos
laughing
upon
my
word
it
is
as
you
say
astonishing
replied
d
artagnan
beginning
to
laugh
also
whereupon
porthos
laughed
louder
than
ever
i
broke
said
porthos
in
a
voice
from
his
increasing
mirth
more
than
three
thousand
francs
worth
of
china
ha
ha
ha
good
said
d
artagnan
i
smashed
more
than
four
thousand
francs
worth
of
glass
ho
ho
ho
without
counting
a
luster
which
fell
on
my
head
and
was
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
ha
ha
ha
upon
your
head
said
d
artagnan
holding
his
sides
on
but
your
head
was
broken
i
suppose
no
since
i
tell
you
on
the
contrary
my
dear
fellow
that
it
was
the
luster
which
was
broken
like
glass
which
in
point
of
fact
it
ah
the
luster
was
glass
you
venetian
glass
a
perfect
curiosity
quite
matchless
indeed
and
weighed
two
hundred
and
it
fell
upon
your
head
upon
my
head
just
imagine
a
globe
of
crystal
gilded
all
over
the
lower
part
beautifully
encrusted
perfumes
burning
at
the
top
with
jets
from
which
flame
issued
when
they
were
i
quite
understand
but
they
were
not
lighted
at
the
time
i
suppose
happily
not
or
i
should
have
been
grilled
and
you
were
only
knocked
down
flat
instead
not
at
how
not
at
all
why
the
luster
fell
on
my
skull
it
appears
that
we
have
upon
the
top
of
our
heads
an
exceedingly
thick
who
told
you
that
porthos
the
doctor
a
sort
of
dome
which
would
bear
bah
yes
it
seems
that
our
skulls
are
made
in
that
speak
for
yourself
my
dear
fellow
it
is
your
own
skull
that
is
made
in
that
manner
and
not
the
skulls
of
other
well
that
may
be
so
said
porthos
conceitedly
so
much
however
was
that
the
case
in
my
instance
that
no
sooner
did
the
luster
fall
upon
the
dome
which
we
have
at
the
top
of
our
head
than
there
was
a
report
like
a
cannon
the
crystal
was
broken
to
pieces
and
i
fell
covered
from
head
to
with
blood
poor
porthos
not
at
all
with
perfumes
which
smelt
like
rich
creams
it
was
delicious
but
the
odor
was
too
strong
and
i
felt
quite
giddy
from
it
perhaps
you
have
experienced
it
sometimes
yourself
d
artagnan
yes
in
inhaling
the
scent
of
the
lily
of
the
valley
so
that
my
poor
friend
you
were
knocked
over
by
the
shock
and
overpowered
by
the
perfumes
yes
but
what
is
very
remarkable
for
the
doctor
told
me
he
had
never
seen
anything
like
it
you
had
a
bump
on
your
head
i
suppose
interrupted
d
artagnan
i
had
why
five
i
will
tell
you
the
luster
had
at
its
lower
extremity
five
gilt
ornaments
excessively
oh
well
these
five
ornaments
penetrated
my
hair
which
as
you
see
i
wear
very
fortunately
and
they
made
a
mark
on
my
skin
but
just
notice
the
singularity
of
it
these
things
seem
really
only
to
happen
to
me
instead
of
making
indentations
they
made
bumps
the
doctor
could
never
succeed
in
explaining
that
to
me
well
then
i
will
explain
it
to
you
will
do
me
a
great
service
if
you
will
said
porthos
winking
his
eyes
which
with
him
was
sign
of
the
profoundest
attention
since
you
have
been
employing
your
brain
in
studies
of
an
exalted
character
in
important
calculations
and
so
on
the
head
has
gained
a
certain
advantage
so
that
your
head
is
now
too
full
of
do
you
think
so
i
am
sure
of
it
the
result
is
that
instead
of
allowing
any
foreign
matter
to
penetrate
the
interior
of
the
head
your
bony
box
or
skull
which
is
already
too
full
avails
itself
of
the
openings
which
are
made
in
allowing
this
excess
to
ah
said
porthos
to
whom
this
explanation
appeared
clearer
than
that
of
the
doctor
the
five
protuberances
caused
by
the
five
ornaments
of
the
luster
must
certainly
have
been
scientific
globules
brought
to
the
surface
by
the
force
of
in
fact
said
porthos
the
real
truth
is
that
i
felt
far
worse
outside
my
head
than
inside
i
will
even
confess
that
when
i
put
my
hat
upon
my
head
clapping
it
on
my
head
with
that
graceful
energy
which
we
gentlemen
of
the
sword
possess
if
my
fist
was
not
very
gently
applied
i
experienced
the
most
painful
i
quite
believe
you
therefore
my
friend
said
the
giant
m
fouquet
decided
seeing
how
slightly
built
the
house
was
to
give
me
another
lodging
and
so
they
brought
me
it
is
the
private
park
i
think
is
it
not
where
the
rendezvous
are
made
that
park
indeed
which
is
so
celebrated
in
some
of
those
mysterious
stories
about
the
superintendent
i
don
t
know
i
have
had
no
rendezvous
or
heard
mysterious
stories
myself
but
they
have
authorized
me
to
exercise
my
muscles
and
i
take
advantage
of
the
permission
by
rooting
up
some
of
the
what
for
to
keep
my
hand
in
and
also
to
take
some
birds
nests
i
find
it
more
convenient
than
you
are
as
pastoral
as
tyrcis
my
dear
yes
i
like
the
small
eggs
i
like
them
very
much
better
than
larger
ones
you
have
no
idea
how
delicate
an
is
if
made
of
four
or
five
hundred
eggs
of
linnets
chaffinches
starlings
blackbirds
and
but
five
hundred
eggs
is
perfectly
monstrous
a
will
hold
them
easily
enough
said
porthos
d
artagnan
looked
at
porthos
admiringly
for
full
five
minutes
as
if
he
had
seen
him
for
the
first
time
while
porthos
spread
his
chest
out
joyously
and
proudly
they
remained
in
this
state
several
minutes
porthos
smiling
and
d
artagnan
looking
at
him
d
artagnan
was
evidently
trying
to
give
the
conversation
a
new
turn
do
you
amuse
yourself
much
here
porthos
he
asked
at
last
very
likely
after
he
had
found
out
what
he
was
searching
for
not
i
can
imagine
that
but
when
you
get
thoroughly
bored
by
and
by
what
do
you
intend
to
do
oh
i
shall
not
be
here
for
any
length
of
time
aramis
is
waiting
until
the
last
bump
on
my
head
disappears
in
order
to
present
me
to
the
king
who
i
am
told
can
not
endure
the
sight
of
a
aramis
is
still
in
paris
then
whereabouts
is
he
then
at
alone
with
very
good
but
do
you
happen
to
know
one
thing
no
tell
it
me
and
then
i
shall
well
then
i
think
aramis
is
forgetting
do
you
really
think
so
yes
for
at
fontainebleau
yonder
you
must
know
they
are
laughing
dancing
banqueting
and
drawing
the
corks
of
de
mazarin
s
wine
in
fine
style
are
you
aware
that
they
have
a
ballet
every
evening
there
the
deuce
they
have
i
assure
you
that
your
dear
aramis
is
forgetting
well
that
is
not
at
all
unlikely
and
i
have
myself
thought
so
unless
he
is
playing
you
a
trick
the
sly
fellow
oh
you
know
that
aramis
is
as
sly
as
a
yes
but
to
play
a
trick
listen
in
the
first
place
he
puts
you
under
a
sort
of
he
sequestrates
me
do
you
mean
to
say
i
am
sequestrated
i
think
i
wish
you
would
have
the
goodness
to
prove
that
to
nothing
easier
do
you
ever
go
out
do
you
ever
ride
on
horseback
are
your
friends
allowed
to
come
and
see
you
very
well
then
never
to
go
out
never
to
ride
on
horseback
never
to
be
allowed
to
see
your
friends
that
is
called
being
but
why
should
aramis
sequestrate
me
inquired
porthos
come
said
d
artagnan
be
frank
as
it
was
aramis
who
drew
the
plan
of
the
fortifications
at
was
it
not
porthos
colored
as
he
said
yes
but
that
was
all
he
exactly
and
my
own
opinion
is
that
it
was
no
very
great
affair
after
that
is
mine
very
good
i
am
delighted
we
are
of
the
same
he
never
even
came
to
said
porthos
there
now
you
it
was
i
who
went
to
vannes
as
you
may
have
say
rather
as
i
did
see
well
that
is
precisely
the
state
of
the
case
my
dear
porthos
aramis
who
only
drew
the
plans
wishes
to
pass
himself
off
as
the
engineer
whilst
you
who
stone
by
stone
built
the
wall
the
citadel
and
the
bastions
he
wishes
to
reduce
to
the
rank
of
a
mere
by
builder
you
mean
mason
perhaps
mason
the
very
plasterer
in
fact
hodman
oh
oh
my
dear
aramis
you
seem
to
think
you
are
only
five
and
twenty
years
of
age
yes
and
that
is
not
all
for
he
believes
you
are
i
should
have
amazingly
liked
to
have
seen
him
at
yes
a
fellow
who
has
got
the
gout
who
has
lost
three
of
his
teeth
while
i
look
at
and
porthos
opening
his
large
mouth
very
wide
displayed
two
rows
of
teeth
not
quite
as
white
as
snow
but
even
hard
and
sound
as
ivory
you
can
hardly
believe
porthos
said
d
artagnan
what
a
fancy
the
king
has
for
good
teeth
yours
decide
me
i
will
present
you
to
the
king
you
why
not
do
you
think
i
have
less
credit
at
court
than
aramis
oh
no
do
you
think
i
have
the
slightest
pretensions
upon
the
fortifications
at
certainly
it
is
your
own
interest
alone
which
would
induce
me
to
do
i
don
t
doubt
it
in
the
well
i
am
the
intimate
friend
of
the
king
and
a
proof
of
that
is
that
whenever
there
is
anything
disagreeable
to
tell
him
it
is
i
who
have
to
do
but
dear
d
artagnan
if
you
present
me
well
aramis
will
be
with
me
no
with
bah
whether
he
or
i
present
you
since
you
are
to
be
presented
what
does
it
matter
they
were
going
to
get
me
some
clothes
your
own
are
oh
those
i
had
ordered
were
far
more
take
care
the
king
likes
in
that
case
i
will
be
simple
but
what
will
fouquet
say
when
he
learns
that
i
have
left
are
you
a
prisoner
then
on
parole
no
not
quite
that
but
i
promised
him
i
would
not
leave
without
letting
him
wait
a
minute
we
shall
return
to
that
presently
have
you
anything
to
do
here
i
nothing
nothing
of
any
importance
at
unless
indeed
you
are
aramis
s
representative
for
something
of
by
no
what
i
tell
you
pray
understand
that
is
out
of
interest
for
you
i
suppose
for
instance
that
you
are
commissioned
to
send
messages
and
letters
to
him
ah
letters
yes
i
send
certain
letters
to
where
to
have
you
any
letters
then
but
nay
let
me
speak
have
you
any
letters
i
say
i
have
just
received
one
for
interesting
i
suppose
you
do
not
read
them
then
i
am
not
at
all
curious
said
porthos
as
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
the
soldier
s
letter
which
porthos
had
not
read
but
d
artagnan
had
do
you
know
what
to
do
with
it
said
d
artagnan
of
course
do
as
i
always
do
send
it
to
not
why
not
keep
it
then
did
they
not
tell
you
that
this
letter
was
important
very
well
you
must
take
it
yourself
to
to
aramis
very
and
since
the
king
is
there
you
will
profit
by
i
shall
profit
by
the
opportunity
to
present
you
to
the
ah
d
artagnan
there
is
no
one
like
you
for
therefore
instead
of
forwarding
to
our
friend
any
messages
which
may
or
may
not
be
faithfully
delivered
we
will
ourselves
be
the
bearers
of
the
i
had
never
even
thought
of
that
and
yet
it
is
simple
and
therefore
because
it
is
urgent
porthos
we
ought
to
set
off
at
in
fact
said
porthos
the
sooner
we
set
off
the
less
chance
there
is
of
aramis
s
letter
being
porthos
your
reasoning
is
always
accurate
and
in
your
case
logic
seems
to
serve
as
an
auxiliary
to
the
do
you
think
so
said
porthos
it
is
the
result
of
your
hard
reading
replied
d
artagnan
so
come
along
let
us
be
but
said
porthos
my
promise
to
fouquet
which
not
to
leave
without
telling
him
of
ah
porthos
said
d
artagnan
how
very
young
you
still
in
what
way
you
are
going
to
fontainebleau
are
you
not
where
you
will
find
fouquet
probably
in
the
king
s
palace
yes
repeated
porthos
with
an
air
full
of
majesty
well
you
will
accost
him
with
these
words
m
fouquet
i
have
the
honor
to
inform
you
that
i
have
just
left
and
said
porthos
with
the
same
majestic
mien
seeing
me
at
fontainebleau
at
the
king
s
fouquet
will
not
be
able
to
tell
me
i
am
not
speaking
the
my
dear
porthos
i
was
just
on
the
point
of
opening
my
lips
to
make
the
same
remark
but
you
anticipate
me
in
everything
oh
porthos
how
fortunately
you
are
gifted
years
have
made
not
the
slightest
impression
on
not
then
there
is
nothing
more
to
say
i
think
all
your
scruples
are
removed
quite
in
that
case
i
shall
carry
you
off
with
exactly
and
i
will
go
and
get
my
horse
you
have
horses
here
then
i
have
you
had
them
sent
from
pierrefonds
i
suppose
no
fouquet
gave
them
to
my
dear
porthos
we
shall
not
want
five
horses
for
two
persons
besides
i
have
already
three
in
paris
which
would
make
eight
and
that
will
be
too
it
would
not
be
too
many
if
i
had
some
of
my
servants
here
but
alas
i
have
not
got
do
you
regret
them
then
i
regret
mousqueton
i
miss
what
a
fellow
you
are
porthos
said
d
artagnan
but
the
best
thing
you
can
do
is
to
leave
your
horses
here
as
you
have
left
mousqueton
out
why
so
because
by
and
by
it
might
turn
out
a
very
good
thing
if
fouquet
had
never
given
you
anything
at
i
don
t
understand
you
said
porthos
it
is
not
necessary
you
should
but
yet
i
will
explain
to
you
later
i
ll
wager
it
is
some
piece
of
policy
or
and
of
the
most
subtle
character
returned
d
artagnan
porthos
nodded
his
head
at
this
word
policy
then
after
a
moment
s
reflection
he
added
i
confess
d
artagnan
that
i
am
no
i
know
that
oh
no
one
knows
what
you
told
me
yourself
you
the
bravest
of
the
what
did
i
tell
you
porthos
that
every
man
has
his
day
you
told
me
so
and
i
have
experienced
it
myself
there
are
certain
days
when
one
feels
less
pleasure
than
others
in
exposing
one
s
self
to
a
bullet
or
a
exactly
my
own
and
mine
too
although
i
can
hardly
believe
in
blows
or
thrusts
that
kill
the
deuce
and
yet
you
have
killed
a
few
in
your
yes
but
i
have
never
been
your
reason
is
a
very
good
therefore
i
do
not
believe
i
shall
ever
die
from
a
thrust
of
a
sword
or
a
in
that
case
then
you
are
afraid
of
nothing
ah
water
perhaps
oh
i
swim
like
an
of
a
quartan
fever
then
i
have
never
had
one
yet
and
i
don
t
believe
i
ever
shall
but
there
is
one
thing
i
will
admit
and
porthos
dropped
his
voice
what
is
that
asked
d
artagnan
adopting
the
same
tone
of
voice
as
porthos
i
must
confess
repeated
porthos
that
i
am
horribly
afraid
of
ah
bah
exclaimed
d
artagnan
upon
my
word
it
s
true
said
porthos
in
a
stentorian
voice
i
have
seen
his
eminence
monsieur
le
cardinal
de
richelieu
and
his
eminence
monsieur
le
cardinal
de
mazarin
the
one
was
a
red
politician
the
other
a
black
politician
i
never
felt
very
much
more
satisfied
with
the
one
than
with
the
other
the
first
struck
off
the
heads
of
de
marillac
de
thou
de
chalais
de
bouteville
and
de
montmorency
the
second
got
a
whole
crowd
of
frondeurs
cut
in
pieces
and
we
belonged
to
on
the
contrary
we
did
not
belong
to
them
said
d
artagnan
oh
indeed
yes
for
if
i
unsheathed
my
sword
for
the
cardinal
i
struck
it
for
the
my
good
porthos
well
i
have
done
my
dread
of
politics
is
such
that
if
there
is
any
question
of
politics
in
the
matter
i
should
greatly
prefer
to
return
to
you
would
be
quite
right
if
that
were
the
case
but
with
me
my
dear
porthos
no
politics
at
all
that
is
quite
clear
you
have
labored
hard
in
fortifying
the
king
wished
to
know
the
name
of
the
clever
engineer
under
whose
directions
the
works
were
carried
out
you
are
modest
as
all
men
of
true
genius
are
perhaps
aramis
wishes
to
put
you
under
a
bushel
but
i
happen
to
seize
hold
of
you
i
make
it
known
who
you
are
i
produce
you
the
king
rewards
you
and
that
is
the
only
policy
i
have
to
do
and
the
only
one
i
will
have
to
do
with
either
said
porthos
holding
out
his
hand
to
d
artagnan
but
d
artagnan
knew
porthos
s
grasp
he
knew
that
once
imprisoned
within
the
baron
s
five
fingers
no
hand
ever
left
it
without
being
he
therefore
held
out
not
his
hand
but
his
fist
and
porthos
did
not
even
perceive
the
difference
the
servants
talked
a
little
with
each
other
in
an
undertone
and
whispered
a
few
words
which
d
artagnan
understood
but
which
he
took
very
good
care
not
to
let
porthos
understand
our
friend
he
said
to
himself
was
really
and
truly
aramis
s
prisoner
let
us
now
see
what
the
result
will
be
of
the
liberation
of
the
chapter
iv
the
rat
and
the
cheese
d
artagnan
and
porthos
returned
on
foot
as
d
artagnan
had
set
out
when
d
artagnan
as
he
entered
the
shop
of
the
pilon
d
or
announced
to
planchet
that
du
vallon
would
be
one
of
the
privileged
travelers
and
as
the
plume
in
porthos
s
hat
made
the
wooden
candles
suspended
over
the
front
jingle
together
a
melancholy
presentiment
seemed
to
eclipse
the
delight
planchet
had
promised
himself
for
the
morrow
but
the
grocer
had
a
heart
of
gold
ever
mindful
of
the
good
old
times
a
trait
that
carries
youth
into
old
age
so
planchet
notwithstanding
a
sort
of
internal
shiver
checked
as
soon
as
experienced
received
porthos
with
respect
mingled
with
the
tenderest
cordiality
porthos
who
was
a
little
cold
and
stiff
in
his
manners
at
first
on
account
of
the
social
difference
existing
at
that
period
between
a
baron
and
a
grocer
soon
began
to
soften
when
he
perceived
so
much
and
so
many
kind
attentions
in
planchet
he
was
particularly
touched
by
the
liberty
which
was
permitted
him
to
plunge
his
great
palms
into
the
boxes
of
dried
fruits
and
preserves
into
the
sacks
of
nuts
and
almonds
and
into
the
drawers
full
of
sweetmeats
so
that
notwithstanding
planchet
s
pressing
invitations
to
go
upstairs
to
the
he
chose
as
his
favorite
seat
during
the
evening
which
he
had
to
spend
at
planchet
s
house
the
shop
itself
where
his
fingers
could
always
fish
up
whatever
his
nose
detected
the
delicious
figs
from
provence
filberts
from
the
forest
tours
plums
were
subjects
of
his
uninterrupted
attention
for
five
consecutive
hours
his
teeth
like
millstones
cracked
heaps
of
nuts
the
shells
of
which
were
scattered
all
over
the
floor
where
they
were
trampled
by
every
one
who
went
in
and
out
of
the
shop
porthos
pulled
from
the
stalk
with
his
lips
at
one
mouthful
bunches
of
the
rich
muscatel
raisins
with
their
beautiful
bloom
half
a
pound
of
which
passed
at
one
gulp
from
his
mouth
to
his
stomach
in
one
of
the
corners
of
the
shop
planchet
s
assistants
huddled
together
looked
at
each
other
without
venturing
to
open
their
lips
they
did
not
know
who
porthos
was
for
they
had
never
seen
him
before
the
race
of
those
titans
who
had
worn
the
cuirasses
of
hugh
capet
philip
augustus
and
francis
had
already
begun
to
disappear
they
could
hardly
help
thinking
he
might
be
the
ogre
of
the
fairy
tale
who
was
going
to
turn
the
whole
contents
of
planchet
s
shop
into
his
insatiable
stomach
and
that
too
without
in
the
slightest
degree
displacing
the
barrels
and
chests
that
were
in
it
cracking
munching
chewing
nibbling
sucking
and
swallowing
porthos
occasionally
said
to
the
grocer
you
do
a
very
good
business
here
friend
he
will
very
soon
have
none
at
all
to
do
if
this
sort
of
thing
continues
grumbled
the
foreman
who
had
planchet
s
word
that
he
should
be
his
successor
in
the
midst
of
his
despair
he
approached
porthos
who
blocked
up
the
whole
of
the
passage
leading
from
the
back
shop
to
the
shop
itself
he
hoped
that
porthos
would
rise
and
that
this
movement
would
distract
his
devouring
ideas
what
do
you
want
my
man
asked
porthos
affably
i
should
like
to
pass
you
monsieur
if
it
is
not
troubling
you
too
very
well
said
porthos
it
does
not
trouble
me
in
the
at
the
same
moment
he
took
hold
of
the
young
fellow
by
the
waistband
lifted
him
off
the
ground
and
placed
him
very
gently
on
the
other
side
smiling
all
the
while
with
the
same
affable
expression
as
soon
as
porthos
had
placed
him
on
the
ground
the
lad
s
legs
so
shook
under
him
that
he
fell
back
upon
some
sacks
of
corks
but
noticing
the
giant
s
gentleness
of
manner
he
ventured
again
and
said
ah
monsieur
pray
be
what
about
inquired
porthos
you
are
positively
putting
a
fiery
furnace
into
your
how
is
that
my
good
fellow
all
those
things
are
very
heating
to
the
system
which
raisins
nuts
and
yes
but
if
raisins
nuts
and
almonds
are
heating
there
is
no
doubt
at
all
of
it
honey
is
very
cooling
said
porthos
stretching
out
his
hand
toward
a
small
barrel
of
honey
which
was
open
and
he
plunged
the
scoop
with
which
the
wants
of
the
customers
were
supplied
into
it
and
swallowed
a
good
at
one
gulp
i
must
trouble
you
for
some
water
now
my
man
said
porthos
in
a
pail
monsieur
asked
the
lad
simply
no
in
a
that
will
be
quite
enough
and
raising
the
bottle
to
his
mouth
as
a
trumpeter
does
his
trumpet
he
emptied
the
bottle
at
a
single
draught
planchet
was
agitated
in
every
fibre
of
propriety
and
however
a
worthy
representative
of
the
hospitality
which
prevailed
in
early
days
he
feigned
to
be
talking
very
earnestly
with
d
artagnan
and
incessantly
repeated
ah
monsieur
what
a
happiness
what
an
honor
what
time
shall
we
have
supper
planchet
inquired
porthos
i
feel
the
foreman
clasped
his
hands
together
the
two
others
got
under
the
counters
fearing
porthos
might
have
a
taste
for
human
flesh
we
shall
only
take
a
sort
of
snack
here
said
d
artagnan
and
when
we
get
to
planchet
s
we
will
have
ah
ah
so
we
are
going
to
your
planchet
said
porthos
so
much
the
you
overwhelm
me
monsieur
le
the
monsieur
le
baron
had
a
great
effect
upon
the
men
who
detected
a
personage
of
the
highest
quality
in
an
appetite
of
that
kind
this
title
too
reassured
them
they
had
never
heard
that
an
ogre
was
ever
called
monsieur
le
baron
i
will
take
a
few
biscuits
to
eat
on
the
road
said
porthos
carelessly
and
he
emptied
a
whole
jar
of
aniseed
biscuits
into
the
huge
pocket
of
his
doublet
my
shop
is
saved
exclaimed
planchet
yes
as
the
cheese
was
whispered
the
foreman
what
cheese
the
dutch
cheese
inside
which
a
rat
had
made
his
way
and
we
found
only
the
rind
planchet
looked
all
round
his
shop
and
observing
the
different
articles
which
had
escaped
porthos
s
teeth
he
found
the
comparison
somewhat
exaggerated
the
foreman
who
remarked
what
was
passing
in
his
master
s
mind
said
take
care
he
is
not
gone
have
you
any
fruit
here
said
porthos
as
he
went
upstairs
to
the
where
it
had
just
been
announced
that
some
refreshment
was
prepared
alas
thought
the
grocer
addressing
a
look
at
d
artagnan
full
of
entreaty
which
the
latter
half
understood
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
eating
they
set
off
it
was
late
when
the
three
riders
who
had
left
paris
about
six
in
the
evening
arrived
at
fontainebleau
the
journey
passed
very
agreeably
porthos
took
a
fancy
to
planchet
s
society
because
the
latter
was
very
respectful
in
his
manners
and
seemed
delighted
to
talk
to
him
about
his
meadows
his
woods
and
his
porthos
had
all
the
taste
and
pride
of
a
landed
proprietor
when
d
artagnan
saw
his
two
companions
in
earnest
conversation
he
took
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
and
letting
his
bridle
drop
upon
his
horse
s
neck
separated
himself
from
the
whole
world
as
he
had
done
from
porthos
and
from
planchet
the
moon
shone
softly
through
the
foliage
of
the
forest
the
breezes
of
the
open
country
rose
deliciously
perfumed
to
the
horse
s
nostrils
and
they
snorted
and
pranced
along
delightedly
porthos
and
planchet
began
to
talk
about
planchet
admitted
to
porthos
that
in
the
advanced
years
of
his
life
he
had
certainly
neglected
agricultural
pursuits
for
commerce
but
that
his
childhood
had
been
passed
in
picardy
in
the
beautiful
meadows
where
the
grass
grew
as
high
as
the
knees
and
where
he
had
played
under
the
green
covered
with
fruit
he
went
on
to
say
that
he
had
solemnly
promised
himself
that
as
soon
as
he
should
have
made
his
fortune
he
would
return
to
nature
and
end
his
days
as
he
had
begun
them
as
near
as
he
possibly
could
to
the
earth
itself
where
all
men
must
sleep
at
last
eh
eh
said
porthos
in
that
case
my
dear
monsieur
planchet
your
retirement
is
not
far
how
so
why
you
seem
to
be
in
the
way
of
making
your
fortune
very
well
we
are
getting
on
pretty
well
i
must
admit
replied
planchet
come
tell
me
what
is
the
extent
of
your
ambition
and
what
is
the
amount
you
intend
to
retire
upon
there
is
one
circumstance
monsieur
said
planchet
without
answering
the
question
which
occasions
me
a
good
deal
of
what
is
it
inquired
porthos
looking
all
round
him
as
if
in
search
of
the
circumstance
that
annoyed
planchet
and
desirous
of
freeing
him
from
it
why
formerly
said
the
grocer
you
used
to
call
me
planchet
quite
short
and
you
would
have
spoken
to
me
then
in
a
much
more
familiar
manner
than
you
do
certainly
certainly
i
should
have
said
so
formerly
replied
the
porthos
with
an
embarrassment
full
of
delicacy
but
formerly
formerly
i
was
d
artagnan
s
lackey
is
not
that
what
you
mean
well
if
i
am
not
quite
his
lackey
i
am
as
much
as
ever
i
was
his
devoted
servant
and
more
than
that
since
that
time
well
planchet
since
that
time
i
have
had
the
honor
of
being
in
partnership
with
oh
oh
said
porthos
what
has
d
artagnan
gone
into
the
grocery
business
no
no
said
d
artagnan
whom
these
words
had
drawn
out
of
his
reverie
and
who
entered
into
the
conversation
with
that
readiness
and
rapidity
which
distinguished
every
operation
of
his
mind
and
body
it
was
not
d
artagnan
who
entered
into
the
grocery
business
but
planchet
who
entered
into
a
political
affair
with
yes
said
planchet
with
mingled
pride
and
satisfaction
we
transacted
a
little
business
which
brought
me
in
a
hundred
thousand
francs
and
d
artagnan
two
hundred
oh
oh
said
porthos
with
admiration
so
that
monsieur
le
baron
continued
the
grocer
i
again
beg
you
to
be
kind
enough
to
call
me
planchet
as
you
used
to
do
and
to
speak
to
me
as
familiarly
as
in
old
times
you
can
not
possibly
imagine
the
pleasure
it
would
give
if
that
be
the
case
my
dear
planchet
i
will
do
so
certainly
replied
porthos
and
as
he
was
quite
close
to
planchet
he
raised
his
hand
as
if
to
strike
him
on
the
shoulder
in
token
of
friendly
cordiality
but
a
fortunate
movement
of
the
horse
made
him
miss
his
aim
so
that
his
hand
fell
on
the
crupper
of
planchet
s
horse
instead
which
made
the
animal
s
legs
almost
give
way
d
artagnan
burst
out
laughing
as
he
said
take
care
planchet
for
if
porthos
begins
to
like
you
so
much
he
will
caress
you
and
if
he
caresses
you
he
will
knock
you
as
flat
as
a
pancake
porthos
is
still
as
strong
as
ever
you
oh
said
planchet
mousqueton
is
not
dead
and
yet
monsieur
le
baron
is
very
fond
of
certainly
said
porthos
with
a
sigh
which
made
all
the
three
horses
rear
and
i
was
only
saying
this
very
morning
to
d
artagnan
how
much
i
regretted
him
but
tell
me
planchet
thank
you
monsieur
le
baron
thank
good
lad
good
lad
how
many
acres
of
park
have
you
got
of
park
yes
we
will
reckon
up
the
meadows
presently
and
the
woods
whereabouts
monsieur
at
your
oh
monsieur
le
baron
i
have
neither
chateau
nor
park
nor
meadows
nor
what
have
you
got
then
inquired
porthos
and
why
do
you
call
it
a
i
did
not
call
it
a
monsieur
le
baron
replied
planchet
somewhat
humiliated
but
a
ah
ah
i
understand
you
are
no
monsieur
le
baron
i
speak
the
plain
truth
i
have
rooms
for
a
couple
of
friends
that
s
but
in
that
case
whereabouts
do
your
friends
walk
in
the
first
place
they
can
walk
about
the
king
s
forest
which
is
very
yes
i
know
the
forest
is
very
fine
said
porthos
nearly
as
beautiful
as
my
forest
at
planchet
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
have
you
a
forest
of
the
same
kind
as
the
forest
at
fontainebleau
monsieur
le
baron
he
stammered
out
yes
i
have
two
indeed
but
the
one
at
berry
is
my
why
so
asked
planchet
because
i
don
t
know
where
it
ends
and
also
because
it
is
full
of
how
can
the
poachers
make
the
forest
so
agreeable
to
you
because
they
hunt
my
game
and
i
hunt
them
which
in
these
peaceful
times
is
for
me
a
sufficiently
pleasing
picture
of
war
on
a
small
they
had
reached
this
turn
of
conversation
when
planchet
looking
up
perceived
the
houses
at
the
commencement
of
fontainebleau
the
lofty
outlines
of
which
stood
out
strongly
against
the
misty
visage
of
the
heavens
whilst
rising
above
the
compact
and
irregularly
formed
mass
of
buildings
the
pointed
roofs
of
the
chateau
were
clearly
visible
the
slates
of
which
glistened
beneath
the
light
of
the
moon
like
the
scales
of
an
immense
fish
gentlemen
said
planchet
i
have
the
honor
to
inform
you
that
we
have
arrived
at
chapter
planchet
s
the
cavaliers
looked
up
and
saw
that
what
planchet
had
announced
to
them
was
true
ten
minutes
afterwards
they
were
in
the
street
called
the
rue
de
lyon
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
hostelry
of
the
beau
paon
a
high
hedge
of
bushy
elders
hawthorn
and
wild
hops
formed
an
impenetrable
fence
behind
which
rose
a
white
house
with
a
high
tiled
roof
two
of
the
windows
which
were
quite
dark
looked
upon
the
street
between
the
two
a
small
door
with
a
porch
supported
by
a
couple
of
pillars
formed
the
entrance
to
the
house
the
door
was
gained
by
a
step
raised
a
little
from
the
ground
planchet
got
off
his
horse
as
if
he
intended
to
knock
at
the
door
but
on
second
thoughts
he
took
hold
of
his
horse
by
the
bridle
and
led
it
about
thirty
paces
further
on
his
two
companions
following
him
he
then
advanced
about
another
thirty
paces
until
he
arrived
at
the
door
of
a
lighted
by
an
iron
grating
and
lifting
up
a
wooden
latch
pushed
open
one
of
the
he
entered
first
leading
his
horse
after
him
by
the
bridle
into
a
small
courtyard
where
an
odor
met
them
which
revealed
their
close
vicinity
to
a
stable
that
smells
all
right
said
porthos
loudly
getting
off
his
horse
and
i
almost
begin
to
think
i
am
near
my
own
cows
at
i
have
only
one
cow
planchet
hastened
to
say
modestly
and
i
have
thirty
said
porthos
or
rather
i
don
t
exactly
know
how
many
i
when
the
two
cavaliers
had
entered
planchet
fastened
the
door
behind
them
in
the
meantime
d
artagnan
who
had
dismounted
with
his
usual
agility
inhaled
the
fresh
perfumed
air
with
the
delight
a
parisian
feels
at
the
sight
of
green
fields
and
fresh
foliage
plucked
a
piece
of
honeysuckle
with
one
hand
and
of
with
the
other
porthos
clawed
hold
of
some
peas
which
were
twined
round
poles
stuck
into
the
ground
and
ate
or
rather
browsed
upon
them
shells
and
all
and
planchet
was
busily
engaged
trying
to
wake
up
an
old
and
infirm
peasant
who
was
fast
asleep
in
a
shed
lying
on
a
bed
of
moss
and
dressed
in
an
old
stable
suit
of
clothes
the
peasant
recognizing
planchet
called
him
the
master
to
the
grocer
s
great
satisfaction
stable
the
horses
well
old
fellow
and
you
shall
have
something
good
for
yourself
said
planchet
yes
yes
fine
animals
they
are
too
said
the
peasant
oh
they
shall
have
as
much
as
they
gently
gently
my
man
said
d
artagnan
we
are
getting
on
a
little
too
fast
a
few
oats
and
a
good
bed
nothing
some
bran
and
water
for
my
horse
said
porthos
for
it
is
very
warm
i
don
t
be
afraid
gentlemen
replied
planchet
daddy
celestin
is
an
old
gendarme
who
fought
at
ivry
he
knows
all
about
horses
so
come
into
the
and
he
led
the
way
along
a
walk
which
crossed
a
then
a
small
paddock
and
came
out
into
a
little
garden
behind
the
house
the
principal
front
of
which
as
we
have
already
noticed
faced
the
street
as
they
approached
they
could
see
through
two
open
windows
on
the
ground
floor
which
led
into
a
the
interior
of
planchet
s
residence
this
room
softly
lighted
by
a
lamp
placed
on
the
table
seemed
from
the
end
of
the
garden
like
a
smiling
image
of
repose
comfort
and
happiness
in
every
direction
where
the
rays
of
light
fell
whether
upon
a
piece
of
old
china
or
upon
an
article
of
furniture
shining
from
excessive
neatness
or
upon
the
weapons
hanging
against
the
wall
the
soft
light
was
softly
reflected
and
its
rays
seemed
to
linger
everywhere
upon
something
or
another
agreeable
to
the
eye
the
lamp
which
lighted
the
room
whilst
the
foliage
of
jasmine
and
climbing
roses
hung
in
masses
from
the
splendidly
illuminated
a
damask
as
white
as
snow
the
table
was
laid
for
two
persons
wine
sparkled
in
a
long
bottle
and
a
large
jug
of
blue
china
with
a
silver
lid
was
filled
with
foaming
cider
near
the
table
in
a
armchair
reclined
fast
asleep
a
woman
of
about
thirty
years
of
age
her
face
the
very
picture
of
health
and
freshness
upon
her
knees
lay
a
large
cat
with
her
paws
folded
under
her
and
her
eyes
purring
in
that
significant
manner
which
according
to
feline
habits
indicates
perfect
contentment
the
two
friends
paused
before
the
window
in
complete
amazement
while
planchet
perceiving
their
astonishment
was
in
no
little
degree
secretly
delighted
at
it
ah
planchet
you
rascal
said
d
artagnan
i
now
understand
your
oh
oh
there
is
some
white
linen
said
porthos
in
his
turn
in
a
voice
of
thunder
at
the
sound
of
this
gigantic
voice
the
cat
took
flight
the
housekeeper
woke
up
with
a
start
and
planchet
assuming
a
gracious
air
introduced
his
two
companions
into
the
room
where
the
table
was
already
laid
permit
me
my
dear
he
said
to
present
to
you
monsieur
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
my
d
artagnan
took
the
lady
s
hand
in
his
in
the
most
courteous
manner
and
with
precisely
the
same
chivalrous
air
as
he
would
have
taken
madame
s
monsieur
le
baron
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
added
planchet
porthos
bowed
with
a
reverence
which
anne
of
austria
would
have
approved
of
it
was
then
planchet
s
turn
and
he
unhesitatingly
embraced
the
lady
in
question
not
however
until
he
had
made
a
sign
as
if
requesting
d
artagnan
s
and
porthos
s
permission
a
permission
as
a
matter
of
course
frankly
conceded
d
artagnan
complimented
planchet
and
said
you
are
indeed
a
man
who
knows
how
to
make
life
life
monsieur
said
planchet
laughing
is
capital
which
a
man
ought
to
invest
as
sensibly
as
he
possibly
and
you
get
very
good
interest
for
yours
said
porthos
with
a
burst
of
laughter
like
a
peal
of
thunder
planchet
turned
to
his
housekeeper
you
have
before
you
he
said
to
her
the
two
gentlemen
who
influenced
the
greatest
gayest
grandest
portion
of
my
life
i
have
spoken
to
you
about
them
both
very
and
about
two
others
as
well
said
the
lady
with
a
very
decided
flemish
accent
madame
is
dutch
inquired
d
artagnan
porthos
curled
his
mustache
a
circumstance
which
was
not
lost
upon
d
artagnan
who
noticed
everything
i
am
from
antwerp
said
the
lady
and
her
name
is
madame
getcher
said
planchet
you
should
not
call
her
madame
said
d
artagnan
why
not
asked
planchet
because
it
would
make
her
seem
older
every
time
you
call
her
well
i
call
her
and
a
very
pretty
name
too
said
porthos
truchen
said
planchet
came
to
me
from
flanders
with
her
virtue
and
two
thousand
florins
she
ran
away
from
a
brute
of
a
husband
who
was
in
the
habit
of
beating
her
being
myself
a
picard
born
i
was
always
very
fond
of
the
artesian
women
and
it
is
only
a
step
from
artois
to
flanders
she
came
crying
bitterly
to
her
godfather
my
predecessor
in
the
rue
des
lombards
she
placed
her
two
thousand
florins
in
my
establishment
which
i
have
turned
to
very
good
account
and
which
have
brought
her
in
ten
bravo
she
is
free
and
well
off
she
has
a
cow
a
maid
servant
and
old
celestin
at
her
orders
she
mends
my
linen
knits
my
winter
stockings
she
only
sees
me
every
fortnight
and
seems
to
make
herself
in
all
things
tolerably
happy
and
indeed
gentlemen
i
very
happy
and
comfortable
said
truchen
with
perfect
ingenuousness
porthos
began
to
curl
the
other
side
of
his
mustache
the
deuce
thought
d
artagnan
can
porthos
have
any
intentions
in
that
quarter
in
the
meantime
truchen
had
set
her
cook
to
work
had
laid
the
table
for
two
more
and
covered
it
with
every
possible
delicacy
that
could
convert
a
light
supper
into
a
substantial
meal
a
meal
into
a
regular
feast
fresh
butter
salt
beef
anchovies
tunny
a
shopful
of
planchet
s
commodities
fowls
vegetables
salad
fish
from
the
pond
and
the
river
game
from
the
forest
all
the
produce
in
fact
of
the
province
moreover
planchet
returned
from
the
cellar
laden
with
ten
bottles
of
wine
the
glass
of
which
could
hardly
be
seen
for
the
thick
coating
of
dust
which
covered
them
porthos
s
heart
began
to
expand
as
he
said
i
am
hungry
and
he
sat
himself
beside
madame
truchen
whom
he
looked
at
in
the
most
killing
manner
d
artagnan
seated
himself
on
the
other
side
of
her
while
planchet
discreetly
and
full
of
delight
took
his
seat
opposite
do
not
trouble
yourselves
he
said
if
truchen
should
leave
the
table
now
and
then
during
supper
for
she
will
have
to
look
after
your
in
fact
the
housekeeper
made
her
escape
quite
frequently
and
they
could
hear
on
the
first
floor
above
them
the
creaking
of
the
wooden
bedsteads
and
the
rolling
of
the
castors
on
the
floor
while
this
was
going
on
the
three
men
porthos
especially
ate
and
drank
gloriously
it
was
wonderful
to
see
them
the
ten
full
bottles
were
ten
empty
ones
by
the
time
truchen
returned
with
the
cheese
d
artagnan
still
preserved
his
dignity
and
but
porthos
had
lost
a
portion
of
his
and
the
mirth
soon
began
to
grow
somewhat
uproarious
d
artagnan
recommended
a
new
descent
into
the
cellar
and
as
planchet
no
longer
walked
with
the
steadiness
of
a
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
proposed
to
accompany
him
they
set
off
humming
songs
wild
enough
to
frighten
anybody
who
might
be
listening
truchen
remained
behind
at
table
with
porthos
while
the
two
were
looking
behind
the
firewood
for
what
they
wanted
a
sharp
report
was
heard
like
the
impact
of
a
pair
of
lips
on
a
lady
s
cheek
porthos
fancies
himself
at
la
rochelle
thought
d
artagnan
as
they
returned
freighted
with
bottles
planchet
was
singing
so
loudly
that
he
was
incapable
of
noticing
anything
d
artagnan
whom
nothing
ever
escaped
remarked
how
much
redder
truchen
s
left
cheek
was
than
her
right
porthos
was
sitting
on
truchen
s
left
and
was
curling
with
both
his
hands
both
sides
of
his
mustache
at
once
and
truchen
was
looking
at
him
with
a
most
bewitching
smile
the
sparkling
wine
of
anjou
very
soon
produced
a
remarkable
effect
upon
the
three
companions
d
artagnan
had
hardly
strength
enough
left
to
take
a
candlestick
to
light
planchet
up
his
own
staircase
planchet
was
pulling
porthos
along
who
was
following
truchen
who
was
herself
jovial
enough
it
was
d
artagnan
who
found
out
the
rooms
and
the
beds
porthos
threw
himself
into
the
one
destined
for
him
after
his
friend
had
undressed
him
d
artagnan
got
into
his
own
bed
saying
to
himself
i
had
made
up
my
mind
never
to
touch
that
wine
which
brings
my
early
camp
days
back
again
fie
fie
if
my
musketeers
were
only
to
see
their
captain
in
such
a
and
drawing
the
curtains
of
his
bed
he
added
fortunately
enough
though
they
will
not
see
the
country
is
very
amusing
said
porthos
stretching
out
his
legs
which
passed
through
the
wooden
footboard
and
made
a
tremendous
crash
of
which
however
no
one
in
the
house
was
capable
of
taking
the
slightest
notice
by
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
every
one
was
fast
asleep
chapter
vi
showing
what
could
be
seen
from
planchet
s
house
the
next
morning
found
the
three
heroes
sleeping
soundly
truchen
had
closed
the
outside
blinds
to
keep
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
from
the
eyes
of
her
guests
like
a
kind
good
housekeeper
it
was
still
perfectly
dark
then
beneath
porthos
s
curtains
and
under
planchet
s
canopy
when
d
artagnan
awakened
by
an
indiscreet
ray
of
light
which
made
its
way
through
a
in
the
shutters
jumped
hastily
out
of
bed
as
if
he
wished
to
be
the
first
at
a
forlorn
hope
he
took
by
assault
porthos
s
room
which
was
next
to
his
own
the
worthy
porthos
was
sleeping
with
a
noise
like
distant
thunder
in
the
dim
obscurity
of
the
room
his
gigantic
frame
was
prominently
displayed
and
his
swollen
fist
hung
down
outside
the
bed
upon
the
carpet
d
artagnan
awoke
porthos
who
rubbed
his
eyes
in
a
tolerably
good
humor
in
the
meantime
planchet
was
dressing
himself
and
met
at
their
bedroom
doors
his
two
guests
who
were
still
somewhat
unsteady
from
their
previous
evening
s
entertainment
although
it
was
yet
very
early
the
whole
household
was
already
up
the
cook
was
mercilessly
slaughtering
in
the
celestin
was
gathering
white
cherries
in
the
garden
porthos
brisk
and
lively
as
ever
held
out
his
hand
to
planchet
s
and
d
artagnan
requested
permission
to
embrace
madame
truchen
the
latter
to
show
that
she
bore
no
approached
porthos
upon
whom
she
conferred
the
same
favor
porthos
embraced
madame
truchen
heaving
an
enormous
sigh
planchet
took
both
his
friends
by
the
hand
i
am
going
to
show
you
over
the
house
he
said
when
we
arrived
last
night
it
was
as
dark
as
an
oven
and
we
were
unable
to
see
anything
but
in
broad
daylight
everything
looks
different
and
you
will
be
satisfied
i
if
we
begin
by
the
view
you
have
here
said
d
artagnan
that
charms
me
beyond
everything
i
have
always
lived
in
royal
mansions
you
know
and
royal
personages
have
tolerably
sound
ideas
upon
the
selection
of
points
of
i
am
a
great
stickler
for
a
good
view
myself
said
porthos
at
my
chateau
de
pierrefonds
i
have
had
four
avenues
laid
out
and
at
the
end
of
each
is
a
landscape
of
an
altogether
different
character
from
the
you
shall
see
prospect
said
planchet
and
he
led
his
two
guests
to
a
window
ah
said
d
artagnan
this
is
the
rue
de
yes
i
have
two
windows
on
this
side
a
paltry
insignificant
view
for
there
is
always
that
bustling
and
noisy
inn
which
is
a
very
disagreeable
neighbor
i
had
four
windows
here
but
i
bricked
up
let
us
go
on
said
d
artagnan
they
entered
a
corridor
leading
to
the
bedrooms
and
planchet
pushed
open
the
outside
blinds
hollo
what
is
that
out
yonder
said
porthos
the
forest
said
planchet
it
is
the
horizon
a
thick
line
of
green
which
is
yellow
in
the
spring
green
in
the
summer
red
in
the
autumn
and
white
in
the
all
very
well
but
it
is
like
a
curtain
which
prevents
one
seeing
a
greater
yes
said
planchet
still
one
can
see
at
all
events
everything
that
ah
the
open
country
said
porthos
but
what
is
that
i
see
out
there
crosses
and
stones
ah
that
is
the
cemetery
exclaimed
d
artagnan
precisely
said
planchet
i
assure
you
it
is
very
curious
hardly
a
day
passes
that
some
one
is
not
buried
there
for
fontainebleau
is
by
no
means
an
inconsiderable
place
sometimes
we
see
young
girls
clothed
in
white
carrying
banners
at
others
some
of
the
or
rich
citizens
with
choristers
and
all
the
parish
authorities
and
then
too
we
see
some
of
the
officers
of
the
king
s
i
should
not
like
that
said
porthos
there
is
not
much
amusement
in
it
at
all
events
said
d
artagnan
i
assure
you
it
encourages
religious
thoughts
replied
planchet
oh
i
don
t
deny
but
continued
planchet
we
must
all
die
one
day
or
another
and
i
once
met
with
a
maxim
somewhere
which
i
have
remembered
that
the
thought
of
death
is
a
thought
that
will
do
us
all
i
am
far
from
saying
the
contrary
said
porthos
but
objected
d
artagnan
the
thought
of
green
fields
flowers
rivers
blue
horizons
extensive
and
boundless
plains
is
not
likely
to
do
us
if
i
had
any
i
should
be
far
from
rejecting
them
said
planchet
but
possessing
only
this
little
cemetery
full
of
flowers
so
shady
and
quiet
i
am
contented
with
it
and
i
think
of
those
who
live
in
town
in
the
rue
des
lombards
for
instance
and
who
have
to
listen
to
the
rumbling
of
a
couple
of
thousand
vehicles
every
day
and
to
the
soulless
tramp
tramp
tramp
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
but
living
said
porthos
living
remember
that
is
exactly
the
reason
said
planchet
timidly
why
i
feel
it
does
me
good
to
contemplate
a
few
upon
my
word
said
d
artagnan
that
fellow
planchet
is
born
a
philosopher
as
well
as
a
monsieur
said
planchet
i
am
one
of
those
sort
of
men
whom
heaven
created
for
the
purpose
of
living
a
certain
span
of
days
and
of
considering
all
good
they
meet
with
during
their
transitory
stay
on
d
artagnan
sat
down
close
to
the
window
and
as
there
seemed
to
be
something
substantial
in
planchet
s
philosophy
he
mused
over
it
ah
ah
exclaimed
planchet
if
i
am
not
mistaken
we
are
going
to
have
a
representation
now
for
i
think
i
heard
something
like
yes
said
d
artagnan
i
hear
singing
oh
it
is
only
a
burial
of
a
very
poor
description
said
planchet
disdainfully
the
officiating
priest
the
beadle
and
only
one
chorister
boy
nothing
more
you
observe
messieurs
that
the
defunct
lady
or
gentleman
could
not
have
been
of
very
high
no
no
one
seems
to
be
following
the
yes
said
porthos
i
see
a
you
are
right
a
man
wrapped
in
a
cloak
said
d
artagnan
it
s
not
worth
looking
at
said
planchet
i
find
it
interesting
said
d
artagnan
leaning
on
the
come
come
you
are
beginning
to
take
a
fancy
to
the
place
already
said
planchet
delightedly
it
is
exactly
my
own
case
i
was
so
melancholy
at
first
that
i
could
do
nothing
but
make
the
sign
of
the
cross
all
day
and
the
chants
were
like
so
many
nails
being
driven
into
my
head
but
now
they
lull
me
to
sleep
and
no
bird
i
have
ever
seen
or
heard
can
sing
better
than
those
which
are
to
be
met
with
in
this
well
said
porthos
this
is
beginning
to
get
a
little
dull
for
me
and
i
prefer
going
planchet
with
one
bound
was
beside
his
guest
whom
he
offered
to
lead
into
the
garden
what
said
porthos
to
d
artagnan
as
he
turned
round
are
you
going
to
remain
here
yes
i
will
join
you
well
d
artagnan
is
right
after
all
said
planchet
are
they
beginning
to
bury
yet
not
ah
yes
the
is
waiting
until
the
cords
are
fastened
round
the
bier
but
see
a
woman
has
just
entered
the
cemetery
at
the
other
yes
yes
my
dear
planchet
said
d
artagnan
quickly
leave
me
leave
me
i
feel
i
am
beginning
already
to
be
much
comforted
by
my
meditations
so
do
not
interrupt
planchet
left
and
d
artagnan
remained
devouring
with
his
eager
gaze
from
behind
the
blinds
what
was
taking
place
just
before
him
the
two
bearers
of
the
corpse
had
unfastened
the
straps
by
which
they
carried
the
litter
and
were
letting
their
burden
glide
gently
into
the
open
grave
at
a
few
paces
distant
the
man
with
the
cloak
wrapped
round
him
the
only
spectator
of
this
melancholy
scene
was
leaning
with
his
back
against
a
large
and
kept
his
face
and
person
entirely
concealed
from
the
and
the
priests
the
corpse
was
buried
in
five
minutes
the
grave
having
been
filled
up
the
priests
turned
away
and
the
having
addressed
a
few
words
to
them
followed
them
as
they
moved
away
the
man
in
the
mantle
bowed
as
they
passed
him
and
put
a
piece
of
gold
into
the
s
hand
murmured
d
artagnan
it
is
aramis
aramis
in
fact
remained
alone
on
that
side
at
least
for
hardly
had
he
turned
his
head
when
a
woman
s
footsteps
and
the
rustling
of
her
dress
were
heard
in
the
path
close
to
him
he
immediately
turned
round
and
took
off
his
hat
with
the
most
ceremonious
respect
he
led
the
lady
under
the
shelter
of
some
walnut
and
lime
trees
which
overshadowed
a
magnificent
tomb
ah
who
would
have
thought
it
said
d
artagnan
the
bishop
of
vannes
at
a
rendezvous
he
is
still
the
same
abbe
aramis
as
he
was
at
yes
he
added
after
a
pause
but
as
it
is
in
a
cemetery
the
rendezvous
is
but
he
almost
laughed
the
conversation
lasted
for
fully
half
an
hour
d
artagnan
could
not
see
the
lady
s
face
for
she
kept
her
back
turned
towards
him
but
he
saw
perfectly
well
by
the
erect
attitude
of
both
the
speakers
by
their
gestures
by
the
measured
and
careful
manner
with
which
they
glanced
at
each
other
either
by
way
of
attack
or
defense
that
they
must
be
conversing
about
any
other
subject
than
of
love
at
the
end
of
the
conversation
the
lady
rose
and
bowed
profoundly
to
aramis
oh
oh
said
d
artagnan
this
rendezvous
finishes
like
one
of
a
very
tender
nature
though
the
cavalier
kneels
at
the
beginning
the
young
lady
by
and
by
gets
tamed
down
and
then
it
is
she
who
has
to
supplicate
who
is
this
lady
i
would
give
anything
to
this
seemed
impossible
however
for
aramis
was
the
first
to
leave
the
lady
carefully
concealed
her
head
and
face
and
then
immediately
departed
d
artagnan
could
hold
out
no
longer
he
ran
to
the
window
which
looked
out
on
the
rue
de
lyon
and
saw
aramis
entering
the
inn
the
lady
was
proceeding
in
quite
an
opposite
direction
and
seemed
in
fact
to
be
about
to
rejoin
an
equipage
consisting
of
two
led
horses
and
a
carriage
which
he
could
see
standing
close
to
the
borders
of
the
forest
she
was
walking
slowly
her
head
bent
down
absorbed
in
the
deepest
meditation
mordioux
i
must
and
will
learn
who
that
woman
is
said
the
musketeer
again
and
then
without
further
deliberation
he
set
off
in
pursuit
of
her
as
he
was
going
along
he
tried
to
think
how
he
could
possibly
contrive
to
make
her
raise
her
veil
she
is
not
young
he
said
and
is
a
woman
of
high
rank
in
society
i
ought
to
know
that
figure
and
peculiar
style
of
as
he
ran
the
sound
of
his
spurs
and
of
his
boots
upon
the
hard
ground
of
the
street
made
a
strange
jingling
noise
a
fortunate
circumstance
in
itself
which
he
was
far
from
reckoning
upon
the
noise
disturbed
the
lady
she
seemed
to
fancy
she
was
being
either
followed
or
pursued
which
was
indeed
the
case
and
turned
round
d
artagnan
started
as
if
he
had
received
a
charge
of
small
shot
in
his
legs
and
then
turning
suddenly
round
as
if
he
were
going
back
the
same
way
he
had
come
he
murmured
madame
de
chevreuse
d
artagnan
would
not
go
home
until
he
had
learnt
everything
he
asked
celestin
to
inquire
of
the
whose
body
it
was
they
had
buried
that
morning
a
poor
franciscan
mendicant
friar
replied
the
latter
who
had
not
even
a
dog
to
love
him
in
this
world
and
to
accompany
him
to
his
last
if
that
were
really
the
case
thought
d
artagnan
we
should
not
have
found
aramis
present
at
his
funeral
the
bishop
of
vannes
is
not
precisely
a
dog
as
far
as
devotion
goes
his
scent
however
is
quite
as
keen
i
chapter
vii
how
porthos
truchen
and
planchet
parted
with
each
other
on
friendly
terms
thanks
to
d
artagnan
there
was
good
living
in
planchet
s
house
porthos
broke
a
ladder
and
two
stripped
the
and
was
only
unable
to
succeed
in
reaching
the
on
account
as
he
said
of
his
belt
truchen
who
had
become
quite
sociable
with
the
giant
said
that
it
was
not
the
belt
so
much
as
his
corporation
and
porthos
in
a
state
of
the
highest
delight
embraced
truchen
who
gathered
him
a
pailful
of
the
strawberries
and
made
him
eat
them
out
of
her
hands
d
artagnan
who
arrived
in
the
midst
of
these
little
innocent
flirtations
scolded
porthos
for
his
indolence
and
silently
pitied
planchet
porthos
breakfasted
with
a
very
good
appetite
and
when
he
had
finished
he
said
looking
at
truchen
i
could
make
myself
very
happy
truchen
smiled
at
his
remark
and
so
did
planchet
but
not
without
embarrassment
d
artagnan
then
addressed
porthos
you
must
not
let
the
delights
of
capua
make
you
forget
the
real
object
of
our
journey
to
my
presentation
to
the
king
certainly
i
am
going
to
take
a
turn
in
the
town
to
get
everything
ready
for
that
do
not
think
of
leaving
the
house
i
oh
no
exclaimed
porthos
planchet
looked
at
d
artagnan
nervously
will
you
be
away
long
he
inquired
no
my
friend
and
this
very
evening
i
will
release
you
from
two
troublesome
oh
monsieur
d
artagnan
can
you
say
no
no
you
are
a
fellow
but
your
house
is
very
small
such
a
house
with
half
a
dozen
acres
of
land
would
be
fit
for
a
king
and
make
him
very
happy
too
but
you
were
not
born
a
great
no
more
was
porthos
murmured
planchet
but
he
has
become
so
my
good
fellow
his
income
has
been
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
for
the
last
fifty
years
porthos
has
been
the
owner
of
a
couple
of
fists
and
a
backbone
which
are
not
to
be
matched
throughout
the
whole
realm
of
france
porthos
is
a
man
of
the
very
greatest
consequence
compared
to
you
and
well
i
need
say
no
more
for
i
know
you
are
an
intelligent
no
no
monsieur
explain
what
you
look
at
your
orchard
how
stripped
it
is
how
empty
your
larder
your
bedstead
broken
your
cellar
almost
exhausted
look
too
at
madame
truchen
oh
my
goodness
gracious
said
planchet
madame
truchen
is
an
excellent
person
continued
d
artagnan
but
keep
her
for
yourself
do
you
understand
and
he
slapped
him
on
the
shoulder
planchet
at
this
moment
perceived
porthos
and
truchen
sitting
close
together
in
an
arbor
truchen
with
a
grace
of
manner
peculiarly
flemish
was
making
a
pair
of
earrings
for
porthos
out
of
a
double
cherry
while
porthos
was
laughing
as
amorously
as
samson
in
the
company
of
delilah
planchet
pressed
d
artagnan
s
hand
and
ran
towards
the
arbor
we
must
do
porthos
the
justice
to
say
that
he
did
not
move
as
they
approached
and
very
likely
he
did
not
think
he
was
doing
any
harm
nor
indeed
did
truchen
move
either
which
rather
put
planchet
out
but
he
too
had
been
so
accustomed
to
see
fashionable
folk
in
his
shop
that
he
found
no
difficulty
in
putting
a
good
countenance
on
what
seemed
disagreeable
or
rude
planchet
seized
porthos
by
the
arm
and
proposed
to
go
and
look
at
the
horses
but
porthos
pretended
he
was
tired
planchet
then
suggested
that
the
baron
du
vallon
should
taste
some
noyeau
of
his
own
manufacture
which
was
not
to
be
equaled
anywhere
an
offer
the
baron
immediately
accepted
and
in
this
way
planchet
managed
to
engage
his
enemy
s
attention
during
the
whole
of
the
day
by
dint
of
sacrificing
his
cellar
in
preference
to
his
two
hours
afterwards
d
artagnan
returned
everything
is
arranged
he
said
i
saw
his
majesty
at
the
very
moment
he
was
setting
off
for
the
chase
the
king
expects
us
this
the
king
expects
cried
porthos
drawing
himself
up
it
is
a
sad
thing
to
have
to
confess
but
a
man
s
heart
is
like
an
ocean
billow
for
from
that
very
moment
porthos
ceased
to
look
at
madame
truchen
in
that
touching
manner
which
had
so
softened
her
heart
planchet
encouraged
these
ambitious
leanings
as
best
as
he
could
he
talked
over
or
rather
gave
exaggerated
accounts
of
all
the
splendors
of
the
last
reign
its
battles
sieges
and
grand
court
ceremonies
he
spoke
of
the
luxurious
display
which
the
english
made
the
prizes
the
three
brave
companions
carried
off
and
how
d
artagnan
who
at
the
beginning
had
been
the
humblest
of
the
four
finished
by
becoming
the
leader
he
fired
porthos
with
a
generous
feeling
of
enthusiasm
by
reminding
him
of
his
early
youth
now
passed
away
he
boasted
as
much
as
he
could
of
the
moral
life
this
great
lord
had
led
and
how
religiously
he
respected
the
ties
of
friendship
he
was
eloquent
and
skillful
in
his
choice
of
subjects
he
tickled
porthos
frightened
truchen
and
made
d
artagnan
think
at
six
o
clock
the
musketeer
ordered
the
horses
to
be
brought
round
and
told
porthos
to
get
ready
he
thanked
planchet
for
his
kind
hospitality
whispered
a
few
words
about
a
post
he
might
succeed
in
obtaining
for
him
at
court
which
immediately
raised
planchet
in
truchen
s
estimation
where
the
poor
grocer
so
good
so
generous
so
devoted
had
become
much
lowered
ever
since
the
appearance
and
comparison
with
him
of
the
two
great
gentlemen
such
however
is
a
woman
s
nature
they
are
anxious
to
possess
what
they
have
not
got
and
disdain
it
as
soon
as
it
is
acquired
after
having
rendered
this
service
to
his
friend
planchet
d
artagnan
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
to
porthos
that
is
a
very
beautiful
ring
you
have
on
your
it
is
worth
three
hundred
pistoles
said
porthos
madame
truchen
will
remember
you
better
if
you
leave
her
that
ring
replied
d
artagnan
a
suggestion
which
porthos
seemed
to
hesitate
to
adopt
you
think
it
is
not
beautiful
enough
perhaps
said
the
musketeer
i
understand
your
feelings
a
great
lord
such
as
you
would
not
think
of
accepting
the
hospitality
of
an
old
servant
without
paying
him
most
handsomely
for
it
but
i
am
sure
that
planchet
is
too
a
fellow
to
remember
that
you
have
an
income
of
a
hundred
thousand
francs
a
i
have
more
than
half
a
mind
said
porthos
flattered
by
the
remark
to
make
madame
truchen
a
present
of
my
little
farm
at
bracieux
it
has
twelve
it
is
too
much
my
good
porthos
too
much
just
at
present
keep
it
for
a
future
he
then
took
the
ring
off
porthos
s
finger
and
approaching
truchen
said
to
her
madame
monsieur
le
baron
hardly
knows
how
to
entreat
you
out
of
your
regard
for
him
to
accept
this
little
ring
du
vallon
is
one
of
the
most
generous
and
discreet
men
of
my
acquaintance
he
wished
to
offer
you
a
farm
that
he
has
at
bracieux
but
i
dissuaded
him
from
oh
said
truchen
looking
eagerly
at
the
diamond
monsieur
le
baron
exclaimed
planchet
quite
overcome
my
good
friend
stammered
out
porthos
delighted
at
having
been
so
well
represented
by
d
artagnan
these
several
exclamations
uttered
at
the
same
moment
made
quite
a
pathetic
of
a
day
which
might
have
finished
in
a
very
ridiculous
manner
but
d
artagnan
was
there
and
on
every
occasion
wheresoever
d
artagnan
exercised
any
control
matters
ended
only
just
in
the
very
way
he
wished
and
willed
there
were
general
embracings
truchen
whom
the
baron
s
munificence
had
restored
to
her
proper
position
very
timidly
and
blushing
all
the
while
presented
her
forehead
to
the
great
lord
with
whom
she
had
been
on
such
very
pretty
terms
the
evening
before
planchet
himself
was
overcome
by
a
feeling
of
genuine
humility
still
in
the
same
generosity
of
disposition
porthos
would
have
emptied
his
pockets
into
the
hands
of
the
cook
and
of
celestin
but
d
artagnan
stopped
him
no
he
said
it
is
now
my
and
he
gave
one
pistole
to
the
woman
and
two
to
the
man
and
the
benedictions
which
were
showered
down
upon
them
would
have
rejoiced
the
heart
of
harpagon
himself
and
have
rendered
even
him
a
prodigal
d
artagnan
made
planchet
lead
them
to
the
chateau
and
introduced
porthos
into
his
own
apartment
where
he
arrived
safely
without
having
been
perceived
by
those
he
was
afraid
of
meeting
chapter

the
presentation
of
porthos
at
court
at
seven
o
clock
the
same
evening
the
king
gave
an
audience
to
an
ambassador
from
the
united
provinces
in
the
grand
the
audience
lasted
a
quarter
of
an
hour
his
majesty
afterwards
received
those
who
had
been
recently
presented
together
with
a
few
ladies
who
paid
their
respects
first
in
one
corner
of
the
salon
concealed
behind
a
column
porthos
and
d
artagnan
were
conversing
together
waiting
until
their
turn
arrived
have
you
heard
the
news
inquired
the
musketeer
of
his
friend
no
well
look
porthos
raised
himself
on
tiptoe
and
saw
fouquet
in
full
court
dress
leading
aramis
towards
the
king
aramis
said
porthos
presented
to
the
king
by
ah
ejaculated
porthos
for
having
fortified
continued
d
artagnan
and
i
you
oh
you
as
i
have
already
had
the
honor
of
telling
you
are
the
porthos
and
so
they
begged
you
to
take
care
of
a
ah
repeated
porthos
but
happily
i
was
there
said
d
artagnan
and
presently
it
will
be
at
this
moment
fouquet
addressed
the
king
sire
he
said
i
have
a
favor
to
solicit
of
your
majesty
d
herblay
is
not
ambitious
but
he
knows
when
he
can
be
of
service
your
majesty
needs
a
representative
at
rome
who
would
be
able
to
exercise
a
powerful
influence
there
may
i
request
a
cardinal
s
hat
for
d
herblay
the
king
started
i
do
not
often
solicit
anything
of
your
majesty
said
fouquet
that
is
a
reason
certainly
replied
the
king
who
always
expressed
any
hesitation
he
might
have
in
that
manner
and
to
which
remark
there
was
nothing
to
say
in
reply
fouquet
and
aramis
looked
at
each
other
the
king
resumed
m
d
herblay
can
serve
us
equally
well
in
france
an
archbishopric
for
sire
objected
fouquet
with
a
grace
of
manner
peculiarly
his
own
your
majesty
overwhelms
d
herblay
the
archbishopric
may
in
your
majesty
s
extreme
kindness
be
conferred
in
addition
to
the
hat
the
one
does
not
exclude
the
the
king
admired
the
readiness
which
he
displayed
and
smiled
saying
d
artagnan
himself
could
not
have
answered
he
had
no
sooner
pronounced
the
name
than
d
artagnan
appeared
did
your
majesty
call
me
he
said
aramis
and
fouquet
drew
back
a
step
as
if
they
were
about
to
retire
will
your
majesty
allow
me
said
d
artagnan
quickly
as
he
led
forward
porthos
to
present
to
your
majesty
le
baron
du
vallon
one
of
the
bravest
gentlemen
of
france
as
soon
as
aramis
saw
porthos
he
turned
as
pale
as
death
while
fouquet
clenched
his
hands
under
his
ruffles
d
artagnan
smiled
blandly
at
both
of
them
while
porthos
bowed
visibly
overcome
before
the
royal
presence
porthos
here
murmured
fouquet
in
aramis
s
ear
hush
deep
treachery
at
work
hissed
the
latter
sire
said
d
artagnan
it
is
more
than
six
years
ago
i
ought
to
have
presented
du
vallon
to
your
majesty
but
certain
men
resemble
stars
they
move
not
one
inch
unless
their
satellites
accompany
them
the
pleiades
are
never
disunited
and
that
is
the
reason
i
have
selected
for
the
purpose
of
presenting
him
to
you
the
very
moment
when
you
would
see
d
herblay
by
his
aramis
almost
lost
countenance
he
looked
at
d
artagnan
with
a
proud
haughty
air
as
though
willing
to
accept
the
defiance
the
latter
seemed
to
throw
down
ah
these
gentlemen
are
good
friends
then
said
the
king
excellent
friends
sire
the
one
can
answer
for
the
other
ask
de
vannes
now
in
what
manner
was
fortified
fouquet
moved
back
a
step
said
aramis
coldly
was
fortified
by
that
gentleman
and
he
indicated
porthos
with
his
hand
who
bowed
a
second
time
louis
could
not
withhold
his
admiration
though
at
the
same
time
his
suspicions
were
aroused
yes
said
d
artagnan
but
ask
monsieur
le
baron
whose
assistance
he
had
in
carrying
the
works
out
aramis
s
said
porthos
frankly
and
he
pointed
to
the
bishop
what
the
deuce
does
all
this
mean
thought
the
bishop
and
what
sort
of
a
termination
are
we
to
expect
to
this
comedy
what
exclaimed
the
king
is
the
cardinal
s
i
mean
this
bishop
s
name
his
de
said
d
artagnan
my
nickname
said
aramis
a
truce
to
modesty
exclaimed
d
artagnan
beneath
the
priest
s
robe
sire
is
concealed
the
most
brilliant
officer
a
gentleman
of
the
most
unparalleled
intrepidity
and
the
wisest
theologian
in
your
louis
raised
his
head
and
an
engineer
also
it
appears
he
said
admiring
aramis
s
calm
imperturbable
an
engineer
for
a
particular
purpose
sire
said
the
latter
my
companion
in
the
musketeers
sire
said
d
artagnan
with
great
warmth
of
manner
the
man
who
has
more
than
a
hundred
times
aided
your
father
s
ministers
by
his
advice
d
herblay
in
a
word
who
with
du
vallon
myself
and
le
comte
de
la
fere
who
is
known
to
your
majesty
formed
that
quartette
which
was
a
good
deal
talked
about
during
the
late
king
s
reign
and
during
your
majesty
s
and
who
fortified
the
king
repeated
in
a
significant
tone
aramis
advanced
and
bowed
in
order
to
serve
the
son
as
i
served
the
d
artagnan
looked
very
narrowly
at
aramis
while
he
uttered
these
words
which
displayed
so
much
true
respect
so
much
warm
devotion
such
entire
frankness
and
sincerity
that
even
he
d
artagnan
the
eternal
doubter
he
the
almost
infallible
in
judgment
was
deceived
by
it
a
man
who
lies
can
not
speak
in
such
a
tone
as
that
he
said
louis
was
overcome
by
it
in
that
case
he
said
to
fouquet
who
anxiously
awaited
the
result
of
this
proof
the
cardinal
s
hat
is
promised
monsieur
d
herblay
i
pledge
you
my
honor
that
the
first
promotion
shall
be
yours
thank
fouquet
for
colbert
overheard
these
words
they
stung
him
to
the
quick
and
he
left
the
salon
abruptly
and
you
monsieur
du
vallon
said
the
king
what
have
you
to
ask
i
am
truly
pleased
to
have
it
in
my
power
to
acknowledge
the
services
of
those
who
were
faithful
to
my
sire
began
porthos
but
he
was
unable
to
proceed
with
what
he
was
going
to
say
sire
exclaimed
d
artagnan
this
worthy
gentleman
is
utterly
overpowered
by
your
majesty
s
presence
he
who
so
valiantly
sustained
the
looks
and
the
fire
of
a
thousand
foes
but
knowing
what
his
thoughts
are
i
who
am
more
accustomed
to
gaze
upon
the
sun
can
translate
them
he
needs
nothing
absolutely
nothing
his
sole
desire
is
to
have
the
happiness
of
gazing
upon
your
majesty
for
a
quarter
of
an
you
shall
sup
with
me
this
evening
said
the
king
saluting
porthos
with
a
gracious
smile
porthos
became
crimson
from
delight
and
pride
the
king
dismissed
him
and
d
artagnan
pushed
him
into
the
adjoining
apartment
after
he
had
embraced
him
warmly
sit
next
to
me
at
table
said
porthos
in
his
ear
yes
my
aramis
is
annoyed
with
me
i
aramis
has
never
liked
you
so
much
as
he
does
now
fancy
it
was
i
who
was
the
means
of
his
getting
the
cardinal
s
of
course
said
porthos
by
the
by
does
the
king
like
his
guests
to
eat
much
at
his
table
it
is
a
compliment
to
himself
if
you
do
said
d
artagnan
for
he
himself
possesses
a
royal
chapter
ix
explanations
aramis
cleverly
managed
to
effect
a
diversion
for
the
purpose
of
finding
d
artagnan
and
porthos
he
came
up
to
the
latter
behind
one
of
the
columns
and
as
he
pressed
his
hand
said
so
you
have
escaped
from
my
prison
do
not
scold
him
said
d
artagnan
it
was
i
dear
aramis
who
set
him
ah
my
friend
replied
aramis
looking
at
porthos
could
you
not
have
waited
with
a
little
more
patience
d
artagnan
came
to
the
assistance
of
porthos
who
already
began
to
breathe
hard
in
sore
perplexity
you
see
you
members
of
the
church
are
great
politicians
we
mere
soldiers
come
at
once
to
the
point
the
facts
are
these
i
went
to
pay
baisemeaux
a
visit
aramis
pricked
up
his
ears
at
this
announcement
stay
said
porthos
you
make
me
remember
that
i
have
a
letter
from
baisemeaux
for
you
and
porthos
held
out
the
bishop
the
letter
we
have
already
seen
aramis
begged
to
be
allowed
to
read
it
and
read
it
without
d
artagnan
feeling
in
the
slightest
degree
embarrassed
by
the
circumstance
that
he
was
so
well
acquainted
with
the
contents
of
it
besides
aramis
s
face
was
so
impenetrable
that
d
artagnan
could
not
but
admire
him
more
than
ever
after
he
had
read
it
he
put
the
letter
into
his
pocket
with
the
calmest
possible
air
you
were
saying
captain
he
observed
i
was
saying
continued
the
musketeer
that
i
had
gone
to
pay
baisemeaux
a
visit
on
his
majesty
s
on
his
majesty
s
service
said
aramis
yes
said
d
artagnan
and
naturally
enough
we
talked
about
you
and
our
friends
i
must
say
that
baisemeaux
received
me
coldly
so
i
soon
took
my
leave
of
him
as
i
was
returning
a
soldier
accosted
me
and
said
no
doubt
as
he
recognized
me
notwithstanding
i
was
in
private
clothes
captain
will
you
be
good
enough
to
read
me
the
name
written
on
this
envelope
and
i
read
to
monsieur
du
vallon
at
fouquet
s
house
the
deuce
i
said
to
myself
porthos
has
not
returned
then
as
i
fancied
to
or
to
pierrefonds
but
is
at
fouquet
s
house
at
and
as
fouquet
is
not
at
porthos
must
be
quite
alone
or
at
all
events
with
aramis
i
will
go
and
see
porthos
and
i
accordingly
went
to
see
very
good
said
aramis
thoughtfully
you
never
told
me
that
said
porthos
i
had
no
time
my
and
you
brought
back
porthos
with
you
to
fontainebleau
yes
to
planchet
s
does
planchet
live
at
fontainebleau
inquired
aramis
yes
near
the
cemetery
said
porthos
thoughtlessly
what
do
you
mean
by
near
the
cemetery
said
aramis
suspiciously
come
thought
the
musketeer
since
there
is
to
be
a
squabble
let
us
take
advantage
of
yes
the
cemetery
said
porthos
planchet
is
a
very
excellent
fellow
who
makes
very
excellent
preserves
but
his
house
has
windows
which
look
out
upon
the
cemetery
and
a
confoundedly
melancholy
prospect
it
is
so
this
morning
this
morning
said
aramis
more
and
more
excited
d
artagnan
turned
his
back
to
them
and
walked
to
the
window
where
he
began
to
play
a
march
upon
one
of
the
panes
of
glass
yes
this
morning
we
saw
a
man
buried
ah
very
depressing
was
it
not
i
should
never
be
able
to
live
in
a
house
where
burials
can
always
be
seen
from
the
window
d
artagnan
on
the
contrary
seems
to
like
it
very
so
d
artagnan
saw
it
as
well
not
simply
it
he
literally
never
took
his
eyes
off
the
whole
aramis
started
and
turned
to
look
at
the
musketeer
but
the
latter
was
engaged
in
earnest
conversation
with
aramis
continued
to
question
porthos
and
when
he
had
squeezed
all
the
juice
out
of
this
enormous
lemon
he
threw
the
peel
aside
he
turned
towards
his
friend
d
artagnan
and
clapping
him
on
the
shoulder
when
had
left
him
the
king
s
supper
having
been
announced
said
d
yes
my
dear
fellow
he
replied
we
do
not
sup
with
his
majesty
i
believe
well
can
you
give
me
ten
minutes
conversation
twenty
if
you
like
his
majesty
will
take
quite
that
time
to
get
properly
seated
at
where
shall
we
talk
then
here
upon
these
seats
if
you
like
the
king
has
left
we
can
sit
down
and
the
apartment
is
let
us
sit
down
they
sat
down
and
aramis
took
one
of
d
artagnan
s
hands
in
his
tell
me
candidly
my
dear
friend
whether
you
have
not
counseled
porthos
to
distrust
me
a
little
i
admit
i
have
but
not
as
you
understand
it
i
saw
that
porthos
was
bored
to
death
and
i
wished
by
presenting
him
to
the
king
to
do
for
him
and
for
you
what
you
would
never
do
for
what
is
that
speak
in
your
own
and
you
have
done
it
most
nobly
i
thank
and
i
brought
the
cardinal
s
hat
a
little
nearer
just
as
it
seemed
to
be
retreating
from
ah
i
admit
that
said
aramis
with
a
singular
smile
you
are
indeed
not
to
be
matched
for
making
your
friends
fortunes
for
you
see
then
that
i
only
acted
with
the
view
of
making
porthos
s
fortune
for
i
meant
to
have
done
that
myself
but
your
arm
reaches
farther
than
it
was
now
d
artagnan
s
turn
to
smile
come
said
aramis
we
ought
to
deal
truthfully
with
each
other
do
you
still
love
me
d
artagnan
the
same
as
i
used
to
do
replied
d
artagnan
without
compromising
himself
too
much
by
this
reply
in
that
case
thanks
and
now
for
the
most
perfect
frankness
said
aramis
you
visited
on
behalf
of
the
king
you
wished
to
deprive
us
of
the
pleasure
of
offering
completely
fortified
to
the
but
before
i
could
deprive
you
of
that
pleasure
i
ought
to
have
been
made
acquainted
with
your
intention
of
doing
you
came
to
without
knowing
anything
of
you
yes
how
the
devil
could
i
imagine
that
aramis
had
become
so
clever
an
engineer
as
to
be
able
to
fortify
like
polybius
or
archimedes
true
and
yet
you
smelt
me
out
over
yonder
oh
and
porthos
too
i
did
not
divine
that
aramis
was
an
engineer
i
was
only
able
to
guess
that
porthos
might
have
become
one
there
is
a
saying
one
becomes
an
orator
one
is
born
a
poet
but
it
has
never
been
said
one
is
born
porthos
and
one
becomes
an
your
wit
is
always
amusing
said
aramis
coldly
well
i
will
go
do
when
you
found
out
our
secret
you
made
all
the
haste
you
could
to
communicate
it
to
the
i
certainly
made
as
much
haste
as
i
could
since
i
saw
that
you
were
making
still
more
when
a
man
weighing
two
hundred
and
fifty
pounds
as
porthos
does
rides
post
when
a
gouty
prelate
i
beg
your
pardon
but
you
yourself
told
me
you
were
so
when
a
prelate
scours
the
highway
i
naturally
suppose
that
my
two
friends
who
did
not
wish
to
be
communicative
with
me
had
certain
matters
of
the
highest
importance
to
conceal
from
me
and
so
i
made
as
much
haste
as
my
leanness
and
the
absence
of
gout
would
did
it
not
occur
to
you
my
dear
friend
that
you
might
be
rendering
porthos
and
myself
a
very
sad
service
yes
i
thought
it
not
unlikely
but
you
and
porthos
made
me
play
a
very
ridiculous
part
at
i
beg
your
pardon
said
aramis
excuse
me
said
d
artagnan
so
that
pursued
aramis
you
now
know
everything
no
you
know
i
was
obliged
to
inform
fouquet
of
what
had
happened
in
order
that
he
would
be
able
to
anticipate
what
you
might
have
to
tell
the
king
that
is
rather
not
at
all
fouquet
has
his
enemies
you
will
admit
that
i
and
one
in
a
dangerous
one
a
mortal
enemy
well
in
order
to
counteract
that
man
s
influence
it
was
necessary
that
fouquet
should
give
the
king
a
proof
of
his
great
devotion
to
him
and
of
his
readiness
to
make
the
greatest
sacrifices
he
surprised
his
majesty
by
offering
him
if
you
had
been
the
first
to
reach
paris
the
surprise
would
have
been
destroyed
it
would
have
looked
as
if
we
had
yielded
to
i
that
is
the
whole
mystery
said
aramis
satisfied
that
he
had
at
last
quite
convinced
the
musketeer
only
said
the
latter
it
would
have
been
more
simple
to
have
taken
me
aside
and
said
to
me
my
dear
d
artagnan
we
are
fortifying
and
intend
to
offer
it
to
the
king
tell
us
frankly
for
whom
you
are
acting
are
you
a
friend
of
colbert
or
of
fouquet
perhaps
i
should
not
have
answered
you
but
you
would
have
added
are
you
my
friend
i
should
have
said
aramis
hung
down
his
head
in
this
way
continued
d
artagnan
you
would
have
paralyzed
my
movements
and
i
should
have
gone
to
the
king
and
said
sire
fouquet
is
fortifying
and
exceedingly
well
too
but
here
is
a
note
which
the
governor
of
gave
me
for
your
majesty
or
m
fouquet
is
about
to
wait
upon
your
majesty
to
explain
his
intentions
with
regard
to
i
should
not
have
been
placed
in
an
absurd
position
you
would
have
enjoyed
the
surprise
so
long
planned
and
we
should
not
have
had
any
occasion
to
look
askant
at
each
other
when
we
while
on
the
contrary
replied
aramis
you
have
acted
altogether
as
one
friendly
to
colbert
and
you
really
are
a
friend
of
his
i
suppose
certainly
not
indeed
exclaimed
the
captain
m
colbert
is
a
mean
fellow
and
i
hate
him
as
i
used
to
hate
mazarin
but
without
fearing
well
then
said
aramis
i
love
fouquet
and
his
interests
are
mine
you
know
my
position
i
have
no
property
or
means
whatever
fouquet
gave
me
several
livings
a
bishopric
as
well
fouquet
has
served
and
obliged
me
like
the
man
he
is
and
i
know
the
world
sufficiently
well
to
appreciate
a
kindness
when
i
meet
with
one
fouquet
has
won
my
regard
and
i
have
devoted
myself
to
his
you
could
not
possibly
do
better
you
will
find
him
a
very
liberal
aramis
bit
his
lips
and
then
said
the
best
a
man
could
possibly
he
then
paused
for
a
minute
d
artagnan
taking
good
care
not
to
interrupt
him
i
suppose
you
know
how
porthos
got
mixed
up
in
all
this
no
said
d
artagnan
i
am
curious
of
course
but
i
never
question
a
friend
when
he
wishes
to
keep
a
secret
from
well
then
i
will
tell
it
is
hardly
worth
the
trouble
if
the
confidence
is
to
bind
me
in
any
oh
do
not
be
afraid
there
is
no
man
whom
i
love
better
than
porthos
because
he
is
so
and
porthos
is
so
straightforward
in
everything
since
i
have
become
a
bishop
i
have
looked
for
these
primeval
natures
which
make
me
love
truth
and
hate
d
artagnan
stroked
his
mustache
but
said
nothing
i
saw
porthos
and
again
cultivated
his
acquaintance
his
own
time
hanging
idly
on
his
hands
his
presence
recalled
my
earlier
and
better
days
without
engaging
me
in
any
present
evil
i
sent
for
porthos
to
come
to
vannes
fouquet
whose
regard
for
me
is
very
great
having
learnt
that
porthos
and
i
were
attached
to
each
other
by
old
ties
of
friendship
promised
him
increase
of
rank
at
the
earliest
promotion
and
that
is
the
whole
i
shall
not
abuse
your
confidence
said
d
artagnan
i
am
sure
of
that
my
dear
friend
no
one
has
a
finer
sense
of
honor
than
i
flatter
myself
that
you
are
right
and
now
and
here
the
prelate
looked
searchingly
and
scrutinizingly
at
his
friend
now
let
us
talk
of
ourselves
and
for
ourselves
will
you
become
one
of
fouquet
s
friends
do
not
interrupt
me
until
you
know
what
that
well
i
am
will
you
become
a
marechal
of
france
peer
duke
and
the
possessor
of
a
duchy
with
a
million
of
francs
but
my
friend
replied
d
artagnan
what
must
one
do
to
get
all
that
belong
to
but
i
already
belong
to
the
not
exclusively
i
oh
a
d
artagnan
can
not
be
you
have
i
presume
ambitions
as
noble
hearts
like
yours
yes
certainly
i
well
well
i
wish
to
be
a
marechal
the
king
will
make
me
marechal
duke
peer
the
king
will
make
me
all
aramis
fixed
a
searching
look
upon
d
artagnan
is
not
the
king
master
said
d
artagnan
no
one
disputes
it
but
louis
xiii
was
master
oh
my
dear
friend
between
richelieu
and
louis
xiii
stood
no
d
artagnan
said
the
musketeer
very
quietly
there
are
many
round
the
king
said
aramis
not
for
the
king
s
very
likely
not
still
one
moment
aramis
i
observe
that
every
one
thinks
of
himself
and
never
of
his
poor
prince
i
will
maintain
myself
maintaining
and
if
you
meet
with
ingratitude
the
weak
alone
are
afraid
of
you
are
quite
certain
of
yourself
i
think
still
the
king
may
some
day
have
no
further
need
for
you
on
the
contrary
i
think
his
need
of
me
will
soon
be
greater
than
ever
and
hearken
my
dear
fellow
if
it
became
necessary
to
arrest
a
new
conde
who
would
do
it
this
this
alone
in
france
and
d
artagnan
struck
his
sword
which
clanked
sullenly
on
the
tesselated
floor
you
are
right
said
aramis
turning
very
pale
and
then
he
rose
and
pressed
d
artagnan
s
hand
that
is
the
last
summons
for
supper
said
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
will
you
excuse
me
aramis
threw
his
arm
round
the
musketeer
s
neck
and
said
a
friend
like
you
is
the
brightest
jewel
in
the
royal
and
they
immediately
separated
i
was
right
mused
d
artagnan
there
is
indeed
something
strangely
serious
we
must
hasten
the
explosion
breathed
the
coming
cardinal
for
d
artagnan
has
discovered
the
existence
of
a
chapter
madame
and
de
guiche
it
will
not
be
forgotten
how
comte
de
guiche
left
the
s
apartments
on
the
day
when
louis
xiv
presented
la
valliere
with
the
beautiful
bracelets
he
had
won
in
the
lottery
the
comte
walked
to
and
fro
for
some
time
outside
the
palace
in
the
greatest
distress
from
a
thousand
suspicions
and
anxieties
with
which
his
mind
was
beset
presently
he
stopped
and
waited
on
the
terrace
opposite
the
grove
of
trees
watching
for
madame
s
departure
more
than
half
an
hour
passed
away
and
as
he
was
at
that
moment
quite
alone
the
comte
could
hardly
have
had
any
very
diverting
ideas
at
his
command
he
drew
his
tables
from
his
pocket
and
after
hesitating
over
and
over
again
determined
to
write
these
words
madame
i
implore
you
to
grant
me
one
moment
s
conversation
do
not
be
alarmed
at
this
request
which
contains
nothing
in
any
way
opposed
to
the
profound
respect
with
which
i
subscribe
myself
he
had
signed
and
folded
this
singular
when
he
suddenly
observed
several
ladies
leaving
the
chateau
and
afterwards
several
courtiers
too
in
fact
almost
every
one
that
formed
the
queen
s
circle
he
saw
la
valliere
herself
then
montalais
talking
with
malicorne
he
watched
the
departure
of
the
very
last
of
the
numerous
guests
that
had
a
short
time
before
thronged
the
s
cabinet
madame
herself
had
not
yet
passed
she
would
be
obliged
however
to
cross
the
courtyard
in
order
to
enter
her
own
apartments
and
from
the
terrace
where
he
was
standing
de
guiche
could
see
all
that
was
going
on
in
the
courtyard
at
last
he
saw
madame
leave
attended
by
a
couple
of
pages
who
were
carrying
torches
before
her
she
was
walking
very
quickly
as
soon
as
she
reached
the
door
she
said
let
some
one
go
and
look
for
de
guiche
he
has
to
render
an
account
of
a
mission
he
had
to
discharge
for
me
if
he
should
be
disengaged
request
him
to
be
good
enough
to
come
to
my
de
guiche
remained
silent
hidden
in
the
shade
but
as
soon
as
madame
had
withdrawn
he
darted
from
the
terrace
down
the
steps
and
assumed
a
most
indifferent
air
so
that
the
pages
who
were
hurrying
towards
his
rooms
might
meet
him
ah
it
is
madame
then
who
is
seeking
me
he
said
to
himself
quite
overcome
and
he
crushed
in
his
hand
the
now
worse
than
useless
letter
m
le
comte
said
one
of
the
pages
approaching
him
we
are
indeed
most
fortunate
in
meeting
why
so
messieurs
a
command
from
from
madame
said
de
guiche
looking
surprised
yes
le
comte
her
royal
highness
has
been
asking
for
you
she
expects
to
hear
she
told
us
the
result
of
a
commission
you
had
to
execute
for
her
are
you
at
liberty
i
am
quite
at
her
royal
highness
s
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
follow
us
then
when
de
guiche
entered
the
princess
s
apartments
he
found
her
pale
and
agitated
montalais
was
standing
at
the
door
evidently
uneasy
about
what
was
passing
in
her
mistress
s
mind
de
guiche
appeared
ah
is
that
you
monsieur
de
guiche
said
madame
come
in
i
beg
mademoiselle
de
montalais
i
do
not
require
your
attendance
any
montalais
more
puzzled
than
ever
courtesied
and
withdrew
de
guiche
and
the
princess
were
left
alone
the
comte
had
every
advantage
in
his
favor
it
was
madame
who
had
summoned
him
to
a
rendezvous
but
how
was
it
possible
for
the
comte
to
make
use
of
this
advantage
madame
was
so
whimsical
and
her
disposition
so
changeable
she
soon
allowed
this
to
be
perceived
for
suddenly
opening
the
conversation
she
said
well
have
you
nothing
to
say
to
me
he
imagined
she
must
have
guessed
his
thoughts
he
fancied
for
those
who
are
in
love
are
thus
constituted
being
as
credulous
and
blind
as
poets
or
prophets
he
fancied
she
knew
how
ardent
was
his
desire
to
see
her
and
also
the
subject
uppermost
in
his
mind
yes
madame
he
said
and
i
think
it
very
the
affair
of
the
bracelets
she
exclaimed
eagerly
you
mean
that
i
suppose
yes
and
you
think
the
king
is
in
love
do
you
not
guiche
looked
at
her
for
some
time
her
eyes
sank
under
his
gaze
which
seemed
to
read
her
very
heart
i
think
he
said
that
the
king
may
possibly
have
had
an
idea
of
annoying
some
one
were
it
not
for
that
the
king
would
hardly
show
himself
so
earnest
in
his
attentions
as
he
is
he
would
not
run
the
risk
of
compromising
from
mere
thoughtlessness
of
disposition
a
young
girl
against
whom
no
one
has
been
hitherto
able
to
say
a
indeed
the
bold
shameless
girl
said
the
princess
haughtily
i
can
positively
assure
your
royal
highness
said
de
guiche
with
a
firmness
marked
by
great
respect
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
is
beloved
by
a
man
who
merits
every
respect
for
he
is
a
brave
and
honorable
bragelonne
my
friend
yes
well
and
though
he
is
your
friend
what
does
that
matter
to
the
king
the
king
knows
that
bragelonne
is
affianced
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
as
raoul
has
served
the
king
most
valiantly
the
king
will
not
inflict
an
irreparable
injury
upon
madame
began
to
laugh
in
a
manner
that
produced
a
sinister
impression
upon
de
guiche
i
repeat
madame
i
do
not
believe
the
king
is
in
love
with
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
the
proof
that
i
do
not
believe
it
is
that
i
was
about
to
ask
you
whose
it
is
likely
the
king
is
desirous
of
wounding
you
who
are
well
acquainted
with
the
whole
court
can
perhaps
assist
me
in
ascertaining
that
and
assuredly
with
greater
certainty
since
it
is
everywhere
said
that
your
royal
highness
is
on
very
friendly
terms
with
the
madame
bit
her
lips
and
unable
to
assign
any
good
and
sufficient
reasons
changed
the
conversation
prove
to
me
she
said
fixing
on
him
one
of
those
looks
in
which
the
whole
soul
seems
to
pass
into
the
eyes
prove
to
me
i
say
that
you
intended
to
interrogate
me
at
the
very
moment
i
sent
for
de
guiche
gravely
drew
from
his
pocket
the
now
crumpled
note
that
he
had
written
and
showed
it
to
her
sympathy
she
said
yes
said
the
comte
with
an
indescribable
tenderness
of
tone
sympathy
i
have
explained
to
you
how
and
why
i
sought
you
you
however
have
yet
to
tell
me
madame
why
you
sent
for
true
replied
the
princess
she
hesitated
and
then
suddenly
exclaimed
those
bracelets
will
drive
me
you
expected
the
king
would
offer
them
to
you
replied
de
guiche
why
not
but
before
you
madame
before
you
his
was
there
not
the
queen
herself
to
whom
the
king
should
have
offered
them
before
la
valliere
cried
the
princess
wounded
to
the
quick
could
he
not
have
presented
them
to
me
was
there
not
the
whole
court
indeed
to
choose
from
i
assure
you
madame
said
the
comte
respectfully
that
if
any
one
heard
you
speak
in
this
manner
if
any
one
were
to
see
how
red
your
eyes
are
and
heaven
forgive
me
to
see
too
that
tear
trembling
on
your
eyelids
it
would
be
said
that
your
royal
highness
was
jealous
said
the
princess
haughtily
jealous
of
la
valliere
she
expected
to
see
de
guiche
yield
beneath
her
scornful
gesture
and
her
proud
tone
but
he
simply
and
boldly
replied
jealous
of
la
valliere
yes
am
i
to
suppose
monsieur
she
stammered
out
that
your
object
is
to
insult
me
it
is
not
possible
madame
replied
the
comte
slightly
agitated
but
resolved
to
master
that
fiery
nature
leave
the
room
said
the
princess
thoroughly
exasperated
de
guiche
s
coolness
and
silent
respect
having
made
her
completely
lose
her
temper
de
guiche
fell
back
a
step
bowed
slowly
but
with
great
respect
drew
himself
up
looking
as
white
as
his
lace
cuffs
and
in
a
voice
slightly
trembling
said
it
was
hardly
worth
while
to
have
hurried
here
to
be
subjected
to
this
unmerited
and
he
turned
away
with
hasty
steps
he
had
scarcely
gone
half
a
dozen
paces
when
madame
darted
like
a
tigress
after
him
seized
him
by
the
cuff
and
making
him
turn
round
again
said
trembling
with
passion
as
she
did
so
the
respect
you
pretend
to
have
is
more
insulting
than
the
insult
itself
insult
me
if
you
please
but
at
least
madame
said
the
comte
gently
as
he
drew
his
sword
thrust
this
blade
into
my
heart
rather
than
kill
me
by
at
the
look
he
fixed
upon
her
a
look
full
of
love
resolution
and
despair
even
she
knew
how
readily
the
comte
so
outwardly
calm
in
appearance
would
pass
his
sword
through
his
own
breast
if
she
added
another
word
she
tore
the
blade
from
his
hands
and
pressing
his
arm
with
a
feverish
impatience
which
might
pass
for
tenderness
said
do
not
be
too
hard
upon
me
comte
you
see
how
i
am
suffering
and
yet
you
have
no
pity
for
tears
the
cries
of
this
strange
attack
stifled
her
voice
as
soon
as
de
guiche
saw
her
weep
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
carried
her
to
an
armchair
in
another
moment
she
would
have
been
suffocated
oh
why
he
murmured
as
he
knelt
by
her
side
why
do
you
conceal
your
troubles
from
me
do
you
love
any
one
tell
me
it
would
kill
me
i
know
but
not
until
i
should
have
comforted
consoled
and
served
you
and
do
you
love
me
to
that
extent
she
replied
completely
conquered
i
do
indeed
love
you
to
that
extent
she
placed
both
her
hands
in
his
my
heart
is
indeed
another
s
she
murmured
in
so
low
a
tone
that
her
voice
could
hardly
be
heard
but
he
heard
it
and
said
is
it
the
king
you
love
she
gently
shook
her
head
and
her
smile
was
like
a
clear
bright
streak
in
the
clouds
through
which
after
the
tempest
has
passed
one
almost
fancies
paradise
is
opening
but
she
added
there
are
other
passions
in
a
heart
love
is
poetry
but
the
real
life
of
the
heart
is
pride
comte
i
was
born
on
a
throne
i
am
proud
and
jealous
of
my
rank
why
does
the
king
gather
such
unworthy
objects
round
him
once
more
i
repeat
said
the
comte
you
are
acting
unjustly
towards
that
poor
girl
who
will
one
day
be
my
friend
s
are
you
simple
enough
to
believe
that
comte
if
i
did
not
believe
it
he
said
turning
very
pale
bragelonne
should
be
informed
of
it
indeed
he
should
if
i
thought
that
poor
la
valliere
had
forgotten
the
vows
she
had
exchanged
with
raoul
but
no
it
would
be
cowardly
to
betray
a
woman
s
secret
it
would
be
criminal
to
disturb
a
friend
s
peace
of
you
think
then
said
the
princess
with
a
wild
burst
of
laughter
that
ignorance
is
happiness
i
believe
it
he
replied
prove
it
to
me
then
she
said
hurriedly
it
is
easily
done
madame
it
is
reported
through
the
whole
court
that
the
king
loves
you
and
that
you
return
his
well
she
said
breathing
with
difficulty
well
admit
for
a
moment
that
raoul
my
friend
had
come
and
said
to
me
yes
the
king
loves
madame
and
has
made
an
impression
upon
her
heart
i
possibly
should
have
slain
it
would
have
been
necessary
said
the
princess
with
the
obstinacy
of
a
woman
who
feels
herself
not
easily
overcome
for
de
bragelonne
to
have
had
proofs
before
he
ventured
to
speak
to
you
in
that
such
however
is
the
case
replied
de
guiche
with
a
deep
sigh
that
not
having
been
warned
i
have
never
examined
into
the
matter
seriously
and
i
now
find
that
my
ignorance
has
saved
my
so
then
you
drive
selfishness
and
coldness
to
that
extent
said
madame
that
you
would
let
this
unhappy
young
man
continue
to
love
la
valliere
i
would
until
la
valliere
s
guilt
were
but
the
bracelets
well
madame
since
you
yourself
expected
to
receive
them
from
the
king
what
can
i
possibly
say
the
argument
was
a
telling
one
and
the
princess
was
overwhelmed
by
it
and
from
that
moment
her
defeat
was
assured
but
as
her
heart
and
mind
were
instinct
with
noble
and
generous
feelings
she
understood
de
guiche
s
extreme
delicacy
she
saw
that
in
his
heart
he
really
suspected
that
the
king
was
in
love
with
la
valliere
and
that
he
did
not
wish
to
resort
to
the
common
expedient
of
ruining
a
rival
in
the
mind
of
a
woman
by
giving
the
latter
the
assurance
and
certainty
that
this
rival
s
affections
were
transferred
to
another
woman
she
guessed
that
his
suspicions
of
la
valliere
were
aroused
and
that
in
order
to
leave
himself
time
for
his
convictions
to
undergo
a
change
so
as
not
to
ruin
louise
utterly
he
was
determined
to
pursue
a
certain
straightforward
line
of
conduct
she
could
read
so
much
real
greatness
of
character
and
such
true
generosity
of
disposition
in
her
lover
that
her
heart
really
warmed
with
affection
towards
him
whose
passion
for
her
was
so
pure
and
delicate
despite
his
fear
of
incurring
her
displeasure
de
guiche
by
retaining
his
position
as
a
man
of
proud
independence
of
feeling
and
deep
devotion
became
almost
a
hero
in
her
estimation
and
reduced
her
to
the
state
of
a
jealous
and
woman
she
loved
him
for
this
so
tenderly
that
she
could
not
refuse
to
give
him
a
proof
of
her
affection
see
how
many
words
we
have
wasted
she
said
taking
his
hand
suspicions
anxieties
mistrust
sufferings
i
think
we
have
enumerated
all
those
alas
madame
efface
them
from
your
heart
as
i
drive
them
from
mine
whether
la
valliere
does
or
does
not
love
the
king
and
whether
the
king
does
or
does
not
love
la
valliere
from
this
moment
you
and
i
will
draw
a
distinction
in
the
two
characters
i
have
to
perform
you
open
your
eyes
so
wide
that
i
am
sure
you
hardly
understand
you
are
so
impetuous
madame
that
i
always
tremble
at
the
fear
of
displeasing
and
see
how
he
trembles
now
poor
fellow
she
said
with
the
most
charming
playfulness
of
manner
yes
monsieur
i
have
two
characters
to
perform
i
am
the
sister
of
the
king
the
of
the
king
s
wife
in
this
character
ought
i
not
to
take
an
interest
in
these
domestic
intrigues
come
tell
me
what
you
think
as
little
as
possible
agreed
monsieur
but
it
is
a
question
of
dignity
and
then
you
know
i
am
the
wife
of
the
king
s
de
guiche
sighed
a
circumstance
she
added
with
an
expression
of
great
tenderness
which
will
remind
you
that
i
am
always
to
be
treated
with
the
profoundest
de
guiche
fell
at
her
feet
which
he
kissed
with
the
religious
fervor
of
a
worshipper
and
i
begin
to
think
that
really
and
truly
i
have
another
character
to
perform
i
was
almost
forgetting
name
it
oh
name
it
said
de
guiche
i
am
a
woman
she
said
in
a
voice
lower
than
ever
and
i
he
rose
she
opened
her
arms
and
their
lips
met
a
footstep
was
heard
behind
the
tapestry
and
mademoiselle
de
montalais
appeared
what
do
you
want
said
madame
m
de
guiche
is
wanted
replied
montalais
who
was
just
in
time
to
see
the
agitation
of
the
actors
of
these
four
characters
for
de
guiche
had
consistently
carried
out
his
part
with
heroism
chapter
xi
montalais
and
malicorne
montalais
was
right
de
guiche
thus
summoned
in
every
direction
was
very
much
exposed
from
such
a
multiplication
of
business
to
the
risk
of
not
attending
to
any
it
so
happened
that
considering
the
awkwardness
of
the
interruption
madame
notwithstanding
her
wounded
pride
and
secret
anger
could
not
for
the
moment
at
least
reproach
montalais
for
having
violated
in
so
bold
a
manner
the
order
with
which
she
had
been
dismissed
on
de
guiche
s
entrance
de
guiche
also
lost
his
presence
of
mind
or
it
would
be
more
correct
to
say
had
already
lost
it
before
montalais
s
arrival
for
scarcely
had
he
heard
the
young
girl
s
voice
than
without
taking
leave
of
madame
as
the
most
ordinary
politeness
required
even
between
persons
equal
in
rank
and
station
he
fled
from
her
presence
his
heart
tumultuously
throbbing
and
his
brain
on
fire
leaving
the
princess
with
one
hand
raised
as
though
to
bid
him
adieu
montalais
was
at
no
loss
therefore
to
perceive
the
agitation
of
the
two
lovers
the
one
who
fled
was
agitated
and
the
one
who
remained
was
equally
so
well
murmured
the
young
girl
as
she
glanced
inquisitively
round
her
this
time
at
least
i
think
i
know
as
much
as
the
most
curious
woman
could
possibly
wish
to
madame
felt
so
embarrassed
by
this
inquisitorial
look
that
as
if
she
heard
montalais
s
muttered
side
remark
she
did
not
speak
a
word
to
her
maid
of
honor
but
casting
down
her
eyes
retired
at
once
to
her
bedroom
montalais
observing
this
stood
listening
for
a
moment
and
then
heard
madame
lock
and
bolt
her
door
by
this
she
knew
that
the
rest
of
the
evening
was
at
her
own
disposal
and
making
behind
the
door
which
had
just
been
closed
a
gesture
which
indicated
but
little
real
respect
for
the
princess
she
went
down
the
staircase
in
search
of
malicorne
who
was
very
busily
engaged
at
that
moment
in
watching
a
courier
who
covered
with
dust
had
just
left
the
comte
de
guiche
s
apartments
montalais
knew
that
malicorne
was
engaged
in
a
matter
of
some
importance
she
therefore
allowed
him
to
look
and
stretch
out
his
neck
as
much
as
he
pleased
and
it
was
only
when
malicorne
had
resumed
his
natural
position
that
she
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
well
said
montalais
what
is
the
latest
intelligence
you
have
m
de
guiche
is
in
love
with
fine
news
truly
i
know
something
more
recent
than
well
what
do
you
know
that
madame
is
in
love
with
de
the
one
is
the
consequence
of
the
not
always
my
good
is
that
remark
intended
for
me
present
company
always
thank
you
said
malicorne
well
and
in
the
other
direction
what
is
stirring
the
king
wished
this
evening
after
the
lottery
to
see
mademoiselle
de
la
well
and
he
has
seen
her
no
indeed
what
do
you
mean
by
that
the
door
was
shut
and
so
that
so
that
the
king
was
obliged
to
go
back
again
looking
very
sheepish
like
a
thief
who
has
forgotten
his
and
in
the
third
place
inquired
montalais
the
courier
who
has
just
arrived
for
de
guiche
came
from
de
excellent
said
montalais
clapping
her
hands
together
why
so
because
we
have
work
to
do
if
we
get
weary
now
something
unlucky
will
be
sure
to
we
must
divide
the
work
then
said
malicorne
in
order
to
avoid
nothing
easier
replied
montalais
three
intrigues
carefully
nursed
and
carefully
encouraged
will
produce
one
with
another
and
taking
a
low
average
three
love
letters
a
oh
exclaimed
malicorne
shrugging
his
shoulders
you
can
not
mean
what
you
say
darling
three
letters
a
day
that
may
do
for
sentimental
common
people
a
musketeer
on
duty
a
young
girl
in
a
convent
may
exchange
letters
with
their
lovers
once
a
day
perhaps
from
the
top
of
a
ladder
or
through
a
hole
in
the
wall
a
letter
contains
all
the
poetry
their
poor
little
hearts
have
to
boast
of
but
the
cases
we
have
in
hand
require
to
be
dealt
with
very
well
finish
said
montalais
out
of
patience
with
him
some
one
may
finish
why
i
am
only
at
the
beginning
i
have
still
three
points
as
yet
upon
my
word
he
will
be
the
death
of
me
with
his
flemish
indifference
exclaimed
montalais
and
you
will
drive
me
mad
with
your
italian
vivacity
i
was
going
to
say
that
our
lovers
here
will
be
writing
volumes
to
each
other
but
what
are
you
driving
at
at
this
not
one
of
our
lady
correspondents
will
be
able
to
keep
the
letters
they
may
very
m
de
guiche
will
not
be
able
to
keep
his
that
is
very
well
then
i
will
take
care
of
all
that
is
the
very
thing
that
is
impossible
said
malicorne
why
so
because
you
are
not
your
own
mistress
your
room
is
as
much
la
valliere
s
as
yours
and
there
are
certain
persons
who
will
think
nothing
of
visiting
and
searching
a
maid
of
honor
s
room
so
that
i
am
terribly
afraid
of
the
queen
who
is
as
jealous
as
a
spaniard
of
the
who
is
as
jealous
as
a
couple
of
spaniards
and
last
of
all
of
madame
herself
who
has
jealousy
enough
for
ten
you
forgot
some
one
who
i
was
only
speaking
of
the
women
let
us
add
them
up
then
we
will
call
monsieur
no
de
guiche
no
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
no
and
the
king
the
king
no
of
course
the
king
who
not
only
will
be
more
jealous
but
more
powerful
than
all
the
rest
put
together
ah
my
dear
well
into
what
a
wasp
s
nest
you
have
thrust
yourself
and
as
yet
not
quite
far
enough
if
you
will
follow
me
into
most
certainly
i
will
follow
you
where
you
like
yet
well
yet
while
we
have
time
i
think
it
will
be
prudent
to
turn
but
i
on
the
contrary
think
the
wisest
course
to
take
is
to
put
ourselves
at
once
at
the
head
of
all
these
you
will
never
be
able
to
do
with
you
i
could
superintend
ten
of
them
i
am
in
my
element
you
must
know
i
was
born
to
live
at
the
court
as
the
salamander
is
made
to
live
in
the
your
comparison
does
not
reassure
me
in
the
slightest
degree
in
the
world
my
dear
montalais
i
have
heard
it
said
and
by
learned
men
too
that
in
the
first
place
there
are
no
salamanders
at
all
and
that
if
there
had
been
any
they
would
have
been
infallibly
baked
or
roasted
on
leaving
the
your
learned
men
may
be
very
wise
as
far
as
salamanders
are
concerned
but
they
would
never
tell
you
what
i
can
tell
you
namely
that
aure
de
montalais
is
destined
before
a
month
is
over
to
become
the
first
diplomatist
in
the
court
of
be
it
so
but
on
condition
that
i
shall
be
the
agreed
an
offensive
and
defensive
alliance
of
only
be
very
careful
of
any
i
will
hand
them
to
you
as
i
receive
what
shall
we
tell
the
king
about
madame
that
madame
is
still
in
love
with
his
what
shall
we
tell
madame
about
the
king
that
she
would
be
exceedingly
wrong
not
to
humor
what
shall
we
tell
la
valliere
about
madame
whatever
we
choose
for
la
valliere
is
in
our
how
so
every
what
do
you
mean
in
the
first
place
through
the
vicomte
de
explain
you
do
not
forget
i
hope
that
monsieur
de
bragelonne
has
written
many
letters
to
mademoiselle
de
la
i
forget
well
then
it
was
i
who
received
and
i
who
intercepted
those
and
consequently
it
is
you
who
have
them
still
where
here
oh
no
i
have
them
safe
at
blois
in
the
little
room
you
know
well
that
dear
little
room
that
darling
little
room
the
of
the
palace
i
intend
you
to
live
in
one
of
these
days
but
i
beg
your
pardon
you
said
that
all
those
letters
are
in
that
little
room
did
you
not
put
them
in
a
box
of
course
in
the
same
box
where
i
put
all
the
letters
i
received
from
you
and
where
i
put
mine
also
when
your
business
or
your
amusements
prevented
you
from
coming
to
our
ah
very
good
said
malicorne
why
are
you
satisfied
because
i
see
there
is
a
possibility
of
not
having
to
run
to
blois
after
the
letters
for
i
have
them
you
have
brought
the
box
away
it
was
very
dear
to
me
because
it
belonged
to
be
sure
and
take
care
of
it
for
it
contains
original
documents
that
will
be
of
priceless
value
by
and
i
am
perfectly
well
aware
of
that
indeed
and
that
is
the
very
reason
why
i
laugh
as
i
do
and
with
all
my
heart
and
now
one
last
why
do
we
need
any
one
to
assist
us
no
valets
or
bad
policy
you
will
give
the
letters
you
will
receive
them
oh
we
must
have
no
pride
in
this
affair
otherwise
malicorne
and
mademoiselle
aure
not
transacting
their
own
affairs
themselves
will
have
to
make
up
their
minds
to
see
them
done
by
you
are
quite
right
but
what
is
going
on
yonder
in
de
guiche
s
room
nothing
he
is
only
opening
his
let
us
be
and
they
both
immediately
disappeared
all
the
terms
of
the
contract
being
agreed
on
the
window
just
opened
was
in
fact
that
of
the
comte
de
guiche
it
was
not
alone
with
the
hope
of
catching
a
glimpse
of
madame
through
her
curtains
that
he
seated
himself
by
the
open
window
for
his
preoccupation
of
mind
had
at
that
time
a
different
origin
he
had
just
received
as
we
have
already
stated
the
courier
who
had
been
dispatched
to
him
by
bragelonne
the
latter
having
written
to
de
guiche
a
letter
which
had
made
the
deepest
impression
upon
him
and
which
he
had
read
over
and
over
again
strange
strange
he
murmured
how
irresponsible
are
the
means
by
which
destiny
hurries
men
onward
to
their
fate
leaving
the
window
in
order
to
approach
nearer
to
the
light
he
once
more
read
the
letter
he
had
just
received
calais
my
dear
count
i
found
de
wardes
at
calais
he
has
been
seriously
wounded
in
an
affair
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
de
wardes
is
as
you
know
unquestionably
brave
but
full
of
malevolent
and
wicked
feelings
he
conversed
with
me
about
yourself
for
whom
he
says
he
has
a
warm
regard
also
about
madame
whom
he
considers
a
beautiful
and
amiable
woman
he
has
guessed
your
affection
for
a
certain
person
he
also
talked
to
me
about
the
lady
for
whom
i
have
so
ardent
a
regard
and
showed
the
greatest
interest
on
my
behalf
in
expressing
a
deep
pity
for
me
accompanied
however
by
dark
hints
which
alarmed
me
at
first
but
which
i
at
last
looked
upon
as
the
result
of
his
usual
love
of
mystery
these
are
the
facts
he
had
received
news
of
the
court
you
will
understand
however
that
it
was
only
through
de
lorraine
the
report
goes
so
says
the
news
that
a
change
has
taken
place
in
the
king
s
affections
you
know
whom
that
concerns
afterwards
the
news
continues
people
are
talking
about
one
of
the
maids
of
honor
respecting
whom
various
slanderous
reports
are
being
circulated
these
vague
phrases
have
not
allowed
me
to
sleep
i
have
been
deploring
ever
since
yesterday
that
my
diffidence
and
vacillation
of
purpose
notwithstanding
a
certain
obstinacy
of
character
i
may
possess
have
left
me
unable
to
reply
to
these
insinuations
in
a
word
de
wardes
was
setting
off
for
paris
and
i
did
not
delay
his
departure
with
explanations
for
it
seemed
rather
hard
i
confess
to
a
man
whose
wounds
are
hardly
yet
closed
in
short
he
travelled
by
short
stages
as
he
was
anxious
to
leave
he
said
in
order
to
be
present
at
a
curious
spectacle
the
court
can
not
fail
to
offer
within
a
short
time
he
added
a
few
congratulatory
words
accompanied
by
vague
sympathizing
expressions
i
could
not
understand
the
one
any
more
than
the
other
i
was
bewildered
by
my
own
thoughts
and
tormented
by
a
mistrust
of
this
man
a
mistrust
which
you
know
better
than
any
one
else
i
have
never
been
able
to
overcome
as
soon
as
he
left
my
perceptions
seemed
to
become
clearer
it
is
hardly
possible
that
a
man
of
de
wardes
s
character
should
not
have
communicated
something
of
his
own
malicious
nature
to
the
statements
he
made
to
me
it
is
not
unlikely
therefore
that
in
the
strange
hints
de
wardes
threw
out
in
my
presence
there
may
be
a
mysterious
signification
which
i
might
have
some
difficulty
in
applying
either
to
myself
or
to
some
one
with
whom
you
are
acquainted
being
compelled
to
leave
as
soon
as
possible
in
obedience
to
the
king
s
commands
the
idea
did
not
occur
to
me
of
running
after
de
wardes
in
order
to
ask
him
to
explain
his
reserve
but
i
have
dispatched
a
courier
to
you
with
this
letter
which
will
explain
in
detail
my
various
doubts
i
regard
you
as
myself
you
have
reflected
and
observed
it
will
be
for
you
to
act
de
wardes
will
arrive
very
shortly
endeavor
to
learn
what
he
meant
if
you
do
not
already
know
de
wardes
moreover
pretended
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
left
paris
on
the
very
best
of
terms
with
madame
this
was
an
affair
which
would
have
unhesitatingly
made
me
draw
my
sword
had
i
not
felt
that
i
was
under
the
necessity
of
dispatching
the
king
s
mission
before
undertaking
any
quarrel
whatsoever
burn
this
letter
which
olivain
will
hand
you
whatever
olivain
says
you
may
confidently
rely
on
will
you
have
the
goodness
my
dear
comte
to
recall
me
to
the
remembrance
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
whose
hands
i
kiss
with
the
greatest
respect
your
devoted
de
bragelonne
p
if
anything
serious
should
happen
we
should
be
prepared
for
everything
dispatch
a
courier
to
me
with
this
one
single
word
come
and
i
will
be
in
paris
within
six
and
thirty
hours
after
the
receipt
of
your
de
guiche
sighed
folded
up
the
letter
a
third
time
and
instead
of
burning
it
as
raoul
had
recommended
him
to
do
placed
it
in
his
pocket
he
felt
it
needed
reading
over
and
over
again
how
much
distress
of
mind
yet
what
sublime
confidence
he
shows
murmured
the
comte
he
has
poured
out
his
whole
soul
in
this
letter
he
says
nothing
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
and
speaks
of
his
respect
for
louise
he
cautions
me
on
my
own
account
and
entreats
me
on
his
ah
continued
de
guiche
with
a
threatening
gesture
you
interfere
in
my
affairs
monsieur
de
wardes
do
you
very
well
then
i
will
shortly
occupy
myself
with
yours
as
for
you
poor
raoul
you
who
intrust
your
heart
to
my
keeping
be
assured
i
will
watch
over
with
this
promise
de
guiche
begged
malicorne
to
come
immediately
to
his
apartments
if
possible
malicorne
acknowledged
the
invitation
with
an
activity
which
was
the
first
result
of
his
conversation
with
montalais
and
while
de
guiche
who
thought
that
his
motive
was
undiscovered
malicorne
the
latter
who
appeared
to
be
working
in
the
dark
soon
guessed
his
questioner
s
motives
the
consequence
was
that
after
a
quarter
of
an
hour
s
conversation
during
which
de
guiche
thought
he
had
ascertained
the
whole
truth
with
regard
to
la
valliere
and
the
king
he
had
learned
absolutely
nothing
more
than
his
own
eyes
had
already
acquainted
him
with
while
malicorne
learned
or
guessed
that
raoul
who
was
absent
was
fast
becoming
suspicious
and
that
de
guiche
intended
to
watch
over
the
treasure
of
the
hesperides
malicorne
accepted
the
office
of
dragon
de
guiche
fancied
he
had
done
everything
for
his
friend
and
soon
began
to
think
of
nothing
but
his
personal
affairs
the
next
evening
de
wardes
s
return
and
first
appearance
at
the
king
s
reception
were
announced
when
that
visit
had
been
paid
the
convalescent
waited
on
monsieur
de
guiche
taking
care
however
to
be
at
monsieur
s
apartments
before
the
visit
took
place
chapter
xii
how
de
wardes
was
received
at
court
monsieur
had
received
de
wardes
with
that
marked
favor
light
and
frivolous
minds
bestow
on
every
novelty
that
comes
in
their
way
de
wardes
who
had
been
absent
for
a
month
was
like
fresh
fruit
to
him
to
treat
him
with
marked
kindness
was
an
infidelity
to
old
friends
and
there
is
always
something
fascinating
in
that
moreover
it
was
a
sort
of
reparation
to
de
wardes
himself
nothing
consequently
could
exceed
the
favorable
notice
monsieur
took
of
him
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
who
feared
this
rival
but
a
little
but
who
respected
a
character
and
disposition
only
too
parallel
to
his
own
in
every
particular
with
the
addition
of
a
courage
he
did
not
himself
possess
received
de
wardes
with
a
greater
display
of
regard
and
affection
than
even
monsieur
had
done
de
guiche
as
we
have
said
was
there
also
but
kept
in
the
background
waiting
very
patiently
until
all
these
interchanges
were
over
de
wardes
while
talking
to
the
others
and
even
to
monsieur
himself
had
not
for
a
moment
lost
sight
of
de
guiche
who
he
instinctively
felt
was
there
on
his
account
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
with
the
others
he
went
up
to
de
guiche
they
exchanged
the
most
courteous
compliments
after
which
de
wardes
returned
to
monsieur
and
the
other
gentlemen
in
the
midst
of
these
congratulations
madame
was
announced
she
had
been
informed
of
de
wardes
s
arrival
and
knowing
all
the
details
of
his
voyage
and
duel
she
was
not
sorry
to
be
present
at
the
remarks
she
knew
would
be
made
without
delay
by
one
who
she
felt
assured
was
her
personal
enemy
two
or
three
of
her
ladies
accompanied
her
de
wardes
saluted
madame
in
the
most
graceful
and
respectful
manner
and
as
a
commencement
of
hostilities
announced
in
the
first
place
that
he
could
furnish
the
duke
of
buckingham
s
friends
with
the
latest
news
about
him
this
was
a
direct
answer
to
the
coldness
with
which
madame
had
received
him
the
attack
was
a
vigorous
one
and
madame
felt
the
blow
but
without
appearing
to
have
even
noticed
it
he
rapidly
cast
a
glance
at
monsieur
and
at
de
guiche
the
former
colored
and
the
latter
turned
very
pale
madame
alone
preserved
an
unmoved
countenance
but
as
she
knew
how
many
unpleasant
thoughts
and
feelings
her
enemy
could
awaken
in
the
two
persons
who
were
listening
to
him
she
smilingly
bent
forward
towards
the
traveler
as
if
to
listen
to
the
news
he
had
brought
but
he
was
speaking
of
other
matters
madame
was
brave
even
to
imprudence
if
she
were
to
retreat
it
would
be
inviting
an
attack
so
after
the
first
disagreeable
impression
had
passed
away
she
returned
to
the
charge
have
you
suffered
much
from
your
wounds
monsieur
de
wardes
she
inquired
for
we
have
been
told
that
you
had
the
misfortune
to
get
it
was
now
de
wardes
s
turn
to
wince
he
bit
his
lips
and
replied
no
madame
hardly
at
indeed
and
yet
in
this
terribly
hot
weather
the
were
very
fresh
and
cool
madame
and
then
i
had
one
indeed
what
was
it
the
knowledge
that
my
adversary
s
sufferings
were
still
greater
than
my
ah
you
mean
he
was
more
seriously
wounded
than
you
were
i
was
not
aware
of
that
said
the
princess
with
utter
indifference
oh
madame
you
are
mistaken
or
rather
you
pretend
to
misunderstand
my
remark
i
did
not
say
that
he
was
a
greater
sufferer
in
body
than
myself
but
his
heart
was
very
seriously
de
guiche
comprehended
instinctively
from
what
direction
the
struggle
was
approaching
he
ventured
to
make
a
sign
to
madame
as
if
entreating
her
to
retire
from
the
contest
but
she
without
acknowledging
de
guiche
s
gesture
without
pretending
to
have
noticed
it
even
and
still
smiling
continued
is
it
possible
she
said
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
s
heart
was
touched
i
had
no
idea
until
now
that
a
could
be
alas
madame
replied
de
wardes
politely
every
woman
believes
that
and
it
is
this
belief
that
gives
them
that
superiority
to
man
which
confidence
you
misunderstand
altogether
dearest
said
the
prince
impatiently
m
de
wardes
means
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
s
heart
had
been
touched
not
by
the
sword
but
by
something
ah
very
good
very
good
exclaimed
madame
it
is
a
jest
of
de
wardes
s
very
good
but
i
should
like
to
know
if
the
duke
of
buckingham
would
appreciate
the
jest
it
is
indeed
a
very
great
pity
he
is
not
here
de
the
young
man
s
eyes
seemed
to
flash
fire
oh
he
said
as
he
clenched
his
teeth
there
is
nothing
i
should
like
de
guiche
did
not
move
madame
seemed
to
expect
that
he
would
come
to
her
assistance
monsieur
hesitated
the
chevalier
de
lorraine
advanced
and
continued
the
conversation
madame
he
said
de
wardes
knows
perfectly
well
that
for
a
buckingham
s
heart
to
be
touched
is
nothing
new
and
what
he
has
said
has
already
taken
instead
of
an
ally
i
have
two
enemies
murmured
madame
two
determined
enemies
and
in
league
with
each
and
she
changed
the
conversation
to
change
the
conversation
is
as
every
one
knows
a
right
possessed
by
princes
which
etiquette
requires
all
to
respect
the
remainder
of
the
conversation
was
moderate
enough
in
tone
the
principal
actors
had
rehearsed
their
parts
madame
withdrew
easily
and
monsieur
who
wished
to
question
her
on
several
matters
offered
her
his
hand
on
leaving
the
chevalier
was
seriously
afraid
that
an
understanding
might
be
established
between
the
husband
and
wife
if
he
were
to
leave
them
quietly
together
he
therefore
made
his
way
to
monsieur
s
apartments
in
order
to
surprise
him
on
his
return
and
to
destroy
with
a
few
words
all
the
good
impressions
madame
might
have
been
able
to
sow
in
his
heart
de
guiche
advanced
towards
de
wardes
who
was
surrounded
by
a
large
number
of
persons
and
thereby
indicated
his
wish
to
converse
with
him
de
wardes
at
the
same
time
showing
by
his
looks
and
by
a
movement
of
his
head
that
he
perfectly
understood
him
there
was
nothing
in
these
signs
to
enable
strangers
to
suppose
they
were
otherwise
than
upon
the
most
friendly
footing
de
guiche
could
therefore
turn
away
from
him
and
wait
until
he
was
at
liberty
he
had
not
long
to
wait
for
de
wardes
freed
from
his
questioners
approached
de
guiche
and
after
a
fresh
salutation
they
walked
side
by
side
together
you
have
made
a
good
impression
since
your
return
my
dear
de
wardes
said
the
comte
excellent
as
you
and
your
spirits
are
just
as
lively
as
ever
and
a
very
great
happiness
why
not
everything
is
so
ridiculous
in
this
world
everything
so
absurd
around
you
are
you
are
of
my
opinion
then
i
should
think
so
and
what
news
do
you
bring
us
from
yonder
i
none
at
all
i
have
come
to
look
for
news
but
tell
me
you
surely
must
have
seen
some
people
at
boulogne
one
of
our
friends
for
instance
it
is
no
great
time
some
people
one
of
our
friends
your
memory
is
ah
true
bragelonne
you
exactly
who
was
on
his
way
to
fulfil
a
mission
with
which
he
was
intrusted
to
king
charles
precisely
well
then
did
he
not
tell
you
or
did
not
you
tell
him
i
do
not
precisely
know
what
i
told
him
i
must
confess
but
i
do
know
what
i
did
tell
de
wardes
was
itself
he
perfectly
well
knew
from
de
guiche
s
tone
and
manner
which
was
cold
and
dignified
that
the
conversation
was
about
to
assume
a
disagreeable
turn
he
resolved
to
let
it
take
what
course
it
pleased
and
to
keep
strictly
on
his
guard
may
i
ask
you
what
you
did
not
tell
him
inquired
de
guiche
all
about
la
la
valliere
what
is
it
and
what
was
that
strange
circumstance
you
seem
to
have
known
over
yonder
which
bragelonne
who
was
here
on
the
spot
was
not
acquainted
with
do
you
really
ask
me
that
in
a
serious
manner
nothing
more
what
you
a
member
of
the
court
living
in
madame
s
household
a
friend
of
monsieur
s
a
guest
at
their
table
the
favorite
of
our
lovely
princess
guiche
colored
violently
from
anger
what
princess
are
you
alluding
to
he
said
i
am
only
acquainted
with
one
my
dear
fellow
i
am
speaking
of
madame
herself
are
you
devoted
to
another
princess
then
come
tell
de
guiche
was
on
the
point
of
launching
out
but
he
saw
the
drift
of
the
remark
a
quarrel
was
imminent
between
the
two
young
men
de
wardes
wished
the
quarrel
to
be
only
in
madame
s
name
while
de
guiche
would
not
accept
it
except
on
la
valliere
s
account
from
this
moment
it
became
a
series
of
feigned
attacks
which
would
have
continued
until
one
of
the
two
had
been
touched
home
de
guiche
therefore
resumed
all
the
he
could
command
there
is
not
the
slightest
question
in
the
world
of
madame
in
this
matter
my
dear
de
said
guiche
but
simply
of
what
you
were
talking
about
just
what
was
i
saying
that
you
had
concealed
certain
things
from
certain
things
which
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
replied
de
wardes
no
upon
my
if
you
tell
me
what
they
are
i
shall
know
but
not
otherwise
i
what
i
who
have
just
arrived
from
a
distance
of
sixty
leagues
and
you
who
have
not
stirred
from
this
place
who
have
witnessed
with
your
own
eyes
that
which
rumor
informed
me
of
at
calais
do
you
now
tell
me
seriously
that
you
do
not
know
what
it
is
about
oh
comte
this
is
hardly
charitable
of
as
you
like
de
wardes
but
i
again
repeat
i
know
you
are
truly
discreet
well
perhaps
it
is
very
prudent
of
and
so
you
will
not
tell
me
anything
will
not
tell
me
any
more
than
you
told
bragelonne
you
are
pretending
to
be
deaf
i
see
i
am
convinced
that
madame
could
not
possibly
have
more
command
over
herself
than
double
hypocrite
murmured
guiche
to
himself
you
are
again
returning
to
the
old
very
well
then
continued
de
wardes
since
we
find
it
so
difficult
to
understand
each
other
about
la
valliere
and
bragelonne
let
us
speak
about
your
own
nay
said
de
guiche
i
have
no
affairs
of
my
own
to
talk
about
you
have
not
said
anything
about
me
i
suppose
to
bragelonne
which
you
can
not
repeat
to
my
face
no
but
understand
me
guiche
that
however
much
i
may
be
ignorant
of
certain
matters
i
am
quite
as
conversant
with
others
if
for
instance
we
were
conversing
about
the
intimacies
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
at
paris
as
i
did
during
my
journey
with
the
duke
i
could
tell
you
a
great
many
interesting
circumstances
would
you
like
me
to
mention
them
de
guiche
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
which
was
covered
in
perspiration
no
no
he
said
a
hundred
times
no
i
have
no
curiosity
for
matters
which
do
not
concern
me
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
for
me
nothing
more
than
a
simple
acquaintance
whilst
raoul
is
an
intimate
friend
i
have
not
the
slightest
curiosity
to
learn
what
happened
to
the
duke
while
i
have
on
the
contrary
the
greatest
interest
in
all
that
happened
to
in
paris
yes
in
paris
or
boulogne
you
understand
i
am
on
the
spot
if
anything
should
happen
i
am
here
to
meet
it
whilst
raoul
is
absent
and
has
only
myself
to
represent
him
so
raoul
s
affairs
before
my
but
he
will
return
not
however
until
his
mission
is
completed
in
the
meantime
you
understand
evil
reports
can
not
be
permitted
to
circulate
about
him
without
my
looking
into
and
for
a
better
reason
still
that
he
will
remain
some
time
in
london
said
de
wardes
chuckling
you
think
so
said
de
guiche
simply
think
so
indeed
do
you
suppose
he
was
sent
to
london
for
no
other
purpose
than
to
go
there
and
return
again
immediately
no
no
he
was
sent
to
london
to
remain
ah
de
wardes
said
de
guiche
grasping
de
wardes
s
hand
that
is
a
very
serious
suspicion
concerning
bragelonne
which
completely
confirms
what
he
wrote
to
me
from
de
wardes
resumed
his
former
coldness
of
manner
his
love
of
raillery
had
led
him
too
far
and
by
his
own
imprudence
he
had
laid
himself
open
to
attack
well
tell
me
what
did
he
write
to
you
about
he
inquired
he
told
me
that
you
had
artfully
insinuated
some
injurious
remarks
against
la
valliere
and
that
you
had
seemed
to
laugh
at
his
great
confidence
in
that
young
well
it
is
perfectly
true
i
did
so
said
de
wardes
and
i
was
quite
ready
at
the
time
to
hear
from
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
that
which
every
man
expects
from
another
whenever
anything
may
have
been
said
to
displease
him
in
the
same
way
for
instance
if
i
were
seeking
a
quarrel
with
you
i
should
tell
you
that
madame
after
having
shown
the
greatest
preference
for
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
at
this
moment
supposed
to
have
sent
the
handsome
duke
away
for
your
oh
that
would
not
wound
me
in
the
slightest
degree
my
dear
de
wardes
said
de
guiche
smiling
notwithstanding
the
shiver
that
ran
through
his
whole
frame
why
such
a
favor
would
be
too
great
a
i
admit
that
but
if
i
absolutely
wished
to
quarrel
with
you
i
should
try
and
invent
a
falsehood
perhaps
and
speak
to
you
about
a
certain
arbor
where
you
and
that
illustrious
princess
were
together
i
should
speak
also
of
certain
gratifications
of
certain
kissings
of
the
hand
and
you
who
are
so
secret
on
all
occasions
so
hasty
so
punctilious
well
said
de
guiche
interrupting
him
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
although
he
almost
felt
as
if
he
were
going
to
die
i
swear
i
should
not
care
for
that
nor
should
i
in
any
way
contradict
you
for
you
must
know
my
dear
marquis
that
for
all
matters
which
concern
myself
i
am
a
block
of
ice
but
it
is
a
very
different
thing
when
an
absent
friend
is
concerned
a
friend
who
on
leaving
confided
his
interests
to
my
for
such
a
friend
de
wardes
believe
me
i
am
like
fire
i
understand
you
monsieur
de
guiche
in
spite
of
what
you
say
there
can
not
be
any
question
between
us
just
now
either
of
bragelonne
or
of
this
insignificant
girl
whose
name
is
la
at
this
moment
some
of
the
younger
courtiers
were
crossing
the
apartment
and
having
already
heard
the
few
words
which
had
just
been
pronounced
were
able
also
to
hear
those
which
were
about
to
follow
de
wardes
observed
this
and
continued
aloud
oh
if
la
valliere
were
a
coquette
like
madame
whose
innocent
flirtations
i
am
sure
were
first
of
all
the
cause
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
being
sent
back
to
england
and
afterwards
were
the
reason
of
your
being
sent
into
exile
for
you
will
not
deny
i
suppose
that
madame
s
pretty
ways
really
had
a
certain
influence
over
you
the
courtiers
drew
nearer
to
the
speakers
at
their
head
and
then
manicamp
but
my
dear
fellow
whose
fault
was
that
said
de
guiche
laughing
i
am
a
vain
conceited
fellow
i
know
and
everybody
else
knows
it
too
i
took
seriously
that
which
was
only
intended
as
a
jest
and
got
myself
exiled
for
my
pains
but
i
saw
my
error
i
overcame
my
vanity
and
i
obtained
my
recall
by
making
the
and
by
promising
myself
to
overcome
this
defect
and
the
consequence
is
that
i
am
so
thoroughly
cured
that
i
now
laugh
at
the
very
thing
which
three
or
four
days
ago
would
have
almost
broken
my
heart
but
raoul
is
in
love
and
is
loved
in
return
he
can
not
laugh
at
the
reports
which
disturb
his
happiness
reports
which
you
seem
to
have
undertaken
to
interpret
when
you
know
marquis
as
i
do
as
these
gentlemen
do
as
every
one
does
in
fact
that
all
such
reports
are
pure
calumny
exclaimed
de
wardes
furious
at
seeing
himself
caught
in
the
snare
by
de
guiche
s
coolness
of
temper
certainly
calumny
look
at
this
letter
from
him
in
which
he
tells
me
you
have
spoken
ill
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
where
he
asks
me
if
what
you
reported
about
this
young
girl
is
true
or
not
do
you
wish
me
to
appeal
to
these
gentlemen
de
wardes
to
decide
and
with
admirable
coolness
de
guiche
read
aloud
the
paragraph
of
the
letter
which
referred
to
la
valliere
and
now
continued
de
guiche
there
is
no
doubt
in
the
world
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
you
wished
to
disturb
bragelonne
s
peace
of
mind
and
that
your
remarks
were
maliciously
de
wardes
looked
round
him
to
see
if
he
could
find
support
from
any
one
but
at
the
idea
that
de
wardes
had
insulted
either
directly
or
indirectly
the
idol
of
the
day
every
one
shook
his
head
and
de
wardes
saw
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
messieurs
said
de
guiche
intuitively
divining
the
general
feeling
my
discussion
with
monsieur
de
wardes
refers
to
a
subject
so
delicate
in
its
nature
that
it
is
most
important
no
one
should
hear
more
than
you
have
already
heard
close
the
doors
then
i
beg
you
and
let
us
finish
our
conversation
in
the
manner
which
becomes
two
gentlemen
one
of
whom
has
given
the
other
the
messieurs
messieurs
exclaimed
those
who
were
present
is
it
your
opinion
then
that
i
was
wrong
in
defending
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
said
de
guiche
in
that
case
i
pass
judgment
upon
myself
and
am
ready
to
withdraw
the
offensive
words
i
may
have
used
to
monsieur
de
the
deuce
certainly
not
said
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
is
an
virtue
and
purity
itself
said
manicamp
you
see
monsieur
de
wardes
said
de
guiche
i
am
not
the
only
one
who
undertakes
the
defense
of
that
poor
girl
i
entreat
you
therefore
messieurs
a
second
time
to
leave
us
you
see
it
is
impossible
we
could
be
more
calm
and
composed
than
we
it
was
the
very
thing
the
courtiers
wished
some
went
out
at
one
door
and
the
rest
at
the
other
and
the
two
young
men
were
left
alone
well
played
said
de
wardes
to
the
comte
was
it
not
replied
the
latter
how
can
it
be
wondered
at
my
dear
fellow
i
have
got
quite
rusty
in
the
country
while
the
command
you
have
acquired
over
yourself
comte
confounds
me
a
man
always
gains
something
in
women
s
society
so
pray
accept
my
i
do
accept
and
i
will
make
madame
a
present
of
and
now
my
dear
monsieur
de
wardes
let
us
speak
as
loud
as
you
do
not
defy
i
do
defy
you
for
you
are
known
to
be
an
man
if
you
do
that
you
will
be
looked
upon
as
a
coward
too
and
monsieur
would
have
you
hanged
this
evening
at
his
speak
my
dear
de
wardes
i
have
fought
but
not
quite
enough
i
see
you
would
not
be
sorry
to
fight
with
me
while
my
wounds
are
still
no
better
the
deuce
you
are
unfortunate
in
the
moment
you
have
chosen
a
duel
after
the
one
i
have
just
fought
would
hardly
suit
me
i
have
lost
too
much
blood
at
boulogne
at
the
slightest
effort
my
wounds
would
open
again
and
you
would
really
have
too
good
a
true
said
de
guiche
and
yet
on
your
arrival
here
your
looks
and
your
arms
showed
there
was
nothing
the
matter
with
yes
my
arms
are
all
right
but
my
legs
are
weak
and
then
i
have
not
had
a
foil
in
my
hand
since
that
devil
of
a
duel
and
you
i
am
sure
have
been
fencing
every
day
in
order
to
carry
your
little
conspiracy
against
me
to
a
successful
upon
my
honor
monsieur
replied
de
guiche
it
is
six
months
since
i
last
no
comte
after
due
reflection
i
will
not
fight
at
least
with
you
i
will
await
bragelonne
s
return
since
you
say
it
is
bragelonne
who
finds
fault
with
oh
no
indeed
you
shall
not
wait
until
bragelonne
s
return
exclaimed
the
comte
losing
all
command
over
himself
for
you
have
said
that
bragelonne
might
possibly
be
some
time
before
he
returns
and
in
the
meanwhile
your
wicked
insinuations
would
have
had
their
yet
i
shall
have
my
excuse
so
take
i
will
give
you
a
week
to
finish
your
that
is
better
we
will
wait
a
yes
yes
i
understand
a
week
will
give
time
to
my
adversary
to
make
his
escape
no
no
i
will
not
give
you
one
day
you
are
mad
monsieur
said
de
wardes
retreating
a
step
and
you
are
a
coward
if
you
do
not
fight
willingly
nay
what
is
more
i
will
denounce
you
to
the
king
as
having
refused
to
fight
after
having
insulted
la
ah
said
de
wardes
you
are
dangerously
treacherous
though
you
pass
for
a
man
of
there
is
nothing
more
dangerous
than
the
treachery
as
you
term
it
of
the
man
whose
conduct
is
always
loyal
and
restore
me
the
use
of
my
legs
then
or
get
yourself
bled
till
you
are
as
white
as
i
am
so
as
to
equalize
our
no
no
i
have
something
better
than
that
to
what
is
it
we
will
fight
on
horseback
and
will
exchange
three
each
you
are
a
first
rate
marksman
i
have
seen
you
bring
down
swallows
with
single
balls
and
at
full
gallop
do
not
deny
it
for
i
have
seen
you
i
believe
you
are
right
said
de
wardes
and
as
that
is
the
case
it
is
not
unlikely
i
might
kill
you
would
be
rendering
me
a
very
great
service
if
you
i
will
do
my
is
it
agreed
give
me
your
hand
upon
there
it
is
but
on
one
condition
name
that
not
a
word
shall
be
said
about
it
to
the
not
a
word
i
i
will
go
and
get
my
horse
and
i
where
shall
we
meet
in
the
plain
i
know
an
admirable
shall
we
go
together
why
not
and
both
of
them
on
their
way
to
the
stables
passed
beneath
madame
s
windows
which
were
faintly
lighted
a
shadow
could
be
seen
behind
the
lace
curtains
there
is
a
woman
said
de
wardes
smiling
who
does
not
suspect
that
we
are
going
to
fight
to
die
perhaps
on
her
chapter
xiii
the
combat
de
wardes
and
de
guiche
selected
their
horses
and
saddled
them
with
their
own
hands
with
holster
saddles
de
guiche
having
two
pairs
of
pistols
went
to
his
apartments
to
get
them
and
after
having
loaded
them
gave
the
choice
to
de
wardes
who
selected
the
pair
he
had
made
use
of
twenty
times
before
the
same
indeed
with
which
de
guiche
had
seen
him
kill
swallows
flying
you
will
not
be
surprised
he
said
if
i
take
every
precaution
you
know
the
weapons
well
and
consequently
i
am
only
making
the
chances
your
remark
was
quite
useless
replied
de
guiche
and
you
have
done
no
more
than
you
are
entitled
to
now
said
de
wardes
i
beg
you
to
have
the
goodness
to
help
me
to
mount
for
i
still
experience
a
little
difficulty
in
doing
in
that
case
we
had
better
settle
the
matter
on
no
once
in
the
saddle
i
shall
be
all
very
good
then
we
will
not
speak
of
it
again
said
de
guiche
as
he
assisted
de
wardes
to
mount
his
horse
and
now
continued
the
young
man
in
our
eagerness
to
murder
one
another
we
have
neglected
one
what
is
that
that
it
is
quite
dark
and
we
shall
almost
be
obliged
to
grope
about
in
order
to
oh
said
de
guiche
you
are
as
anxious
as
i
am
that
everything
should
be
done
in
proper
yes
but
i
do
not
wish
people
to
say
that
you
have
assassinated
me
any
more
than
supposing
i
were
to
kill
you
i
should
myself
like
to
be
accused
of
such
a
did
any
one
make
a
similar
remark
about
your
duel
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
said
de
guiche
it
took
place
precisely
under
the
same
conditions
as
very
true
but
there
was
still
light
enough
to
see
by
and
we
were
up
to
our
middles
almost
in
the
water
besides
there
were
a
good
number
of
spectators
on
shore
looking
at
de
guiche
reflected
for
a
moment
and
the
thought
which
had
already
presented
itself
to
him
became
more
confirmed
that
de
wardes
wished
to
have
witnesses
present
in
order
to
bring
back
the
conversation
about
madame
and
to
give
a
new
turn
to
the
combat
he
avoided
saying
a
word
in
reply
therefore
and
as
de
wardes
once
more
looked
at
him
interrogatively
he
replied
by
a
movement
of
the
head
that
it
would
be
best
to
let
things
remain
as
they
were
the
two
adversaries
consequently
set
off
and
left
the
chateau
by
the
same
gate
close
to
which
we
may
remember
to
have
seen
montalais
and
malicorne
together
the
night
as
if
to
counteract
the
extreme
heat
of
the
day
had
gathered
the
clouds
together
in
masses
which
were
moving
slowly
along
from
the
west
to
the
east
the
vault
above
without
a
clear
spot
anywhere
visible
or
without
the
faintest
indication
of
thunder
seemed
to
hang
heavily
over
the
earth
and
soon
began
by
the
force
of
the
wind
to
split
into
streamers
like
a
huge
sheet
torn
to
shreds
large
and
warm
drops
of
rain
began
to
fall
heavily
and
gathered
the
dust
into
globules
which
rolled
along
the
ground
at
the
same
time
the
hedges
which
seemed
conscious
of
the
approaching
storm
the
thirsty
plants
the
drooping
branches
of
the
trees
exhaled
a
thousand
aromatic
odors
which
revived
in
the
mind
tender
recollections
thoughts
of
youth
endless
life
happiness
and
love
how
fresh
the
earth
smells
said
de
wardes
it
is
a
piece
of
coquetry
to
draw
us
to
by
the
by
replied
de
guiche
several
ideas
have
just
occurred
to
me
and
i
wish
to
have
your
opinion
upon
relative
to
relative
to
our
it
is
quite
some
time
in
fact
that
we
should
begin
to
arrange
is
it
to
be
an
ordinary
combat
and
conducted
according
to
established
custom
let
me
first
know
what
your
established
custom
that
we
dismount
in
any
particular
open
space
that
may
suit
us
fasten
our
horses
to
the
nearest
object
meet
each
without
our
pistols
in
our
hands
and
afterwards
retire
for
a
hundred
and
fifty
paces
in
order
to
advance
on
each
very
good
that
is
precisely
the
way
in
which
i
killed
poor
follivent
three
weeks
ago
at
i
beg
your
pardon
but
you
forgot
one
what
is
that
that
in
your
duel
with
follivent
you
advanced
towards
each
other
on
foot
your
swords
between
your
teeth
and
your
pistols
in
your
while
now
on
the
contrary
as
you
can
not
walk
you
yourself
admit
that
we
shall
have
to
mount
our
horses
again
and
charge
and
the
first
who
wishes
to
fire
will
do
that
is
the
best
course
no
doubt
but
it
is
quite
dark
we
must
make
allowances
for
more
missed
shots
than
would
be
the
case
in
the
very
well
each
will
fire
three
times
the
pair
of
pistols
already
loaded
and
one
excellent
where
shall
our
engagement
take
place
have
you
any
preference
you
see
that
small
wood
which
lies
before
us
the
wood
which
is
called
rochin
you
know
it
you
know
that
there
is
an
open
glade
in
the
center
well
this
glade
is
admirably
adapted
for
such
a
purpose
with
a
variety
of
roads
paths
ditches
windings
and
avenues
we
could
not
find
a
better
i
am
perfectly
satisfied
if
you
are
so
we
are
at
our
destination
if
i
am
not
yes
look
at
the
beautiful
open
space
in
the
center
the
faint
light
which
the
stars
afford
seems
concentrated
in
this
spot
the
woods
which
surround
it
seem
with
their
barriers
to
form
its
natural
very
good
do
as
you
let
us
first
settle
the
these
are
mine
if
you
have
any
objection
to
make
you
will
state
i
am
if
the
horse
be
killed
its
rider
will
be
obliged
to
fight
on
that
is
a
matter
of
course
since
we
have
no
change
of
horses
but
that
does
not
oblige
his
adversary
to
his
adversary
will
in
fact
be
free
to
act
as
he
the
adversaries
having
once
met
in
close
contact
can
not
quit
each
other
under
any
circumstances
and
may
consequently
fire
muzzle
to
three
shots
and
no
more
will
do
i
suppose
quite
sufficient
i
think
here
are
powder
and
balls
for
your
pistols
measure
out
three
charges
take
three
balls
i
will
do
the
same
then
we
will
throw
the
rest
of
the
powder
and
balls
and
we
will
solemnly
swear
said
de
wardes
that
we
have
neither
balls
nor
powder
about
us
agreed
and
i
swear
it
said
de
guiche
holding
his
hand
towards
heaven
a
gesture
which
de
wardes
imitated
and
now
my
dear
comte
said
de
wardes
allow
me
to
tell
you
that
i
am
in
no
way
your
dupe
you
already
are
or
soon
will
be
the
accepted
lover
of
madame
i
have
detected
your
secret
and
you
are
afraid
i
shall
tell
others
of
it
you
wish
to
kill
me
to
insure
my
silence
that
is
very
clear
and
in
your
place
i
should
do
the
de
guiche
hung
down
his
head
only
continued
de
wardes
triumphantly
was
it
really
worth
while
tell
me
to
throw
this
affair
of
bragelonne
s
on
my
shoulders
but
take
care
my
dear
fellow
in
bringing
the
wild
boar
to
bay
you
enrage
him
to
madness
in
running
down
the
fox
you
endow
him
with
the
ferocity
of
the
jaguar
the
consequence
is
that
brought
to
bay
by
you
i
shall
defend
myself
to
the
very
you
will
be
quite
right
to
do
yes
but
take
care
i
shall
work
more
harm
than
you
think
in
the
first
place
as
a
beginning
you
will
readily
suppose
that
i
have
not
been
absurd
enough
to
lock
up
my
secret
or
your
secret
rather
in
my
own
breast
there
is
a
friend
of
mine
who
resembles
me
in
every
way
a
man
whom
you
know
very
well
who
shares
my
secret
with
me
so
pray
understand
that
if
you
kill
me
my
death
will
not
have
been
of
much
service
to
you
whilst
on
the
contrary
if
i
kill
you
and
everything
is
possible
you
know
you
understand
de
guiche
shuddered
if
i
kill
you
continued
de
wardes
you
will
have
secured
two
mortal
enemies
to
madame
who
will
do
their
very
utmost
to
ruin
oh
monsieur
exclaimed
de
guiche
furiously
do
not
reckon
upon
my
death
so
easily
of
the
two
enemies
you
speak
of
i
trust
most
heartily
to
dispose
of
one
immediately
and
the
other
at
the
earliest
the
only
reply
de
wardes
made
was
a
burst
of
laughter
so
diabolical
in
its
sound
that
a
superstitious
man
would
have
been
terrified
but
de
guiche
was
not
so
impressionable
as
that
i
think
he
said
that
everything
is
now
settled
monsieur
de
wardes
so
have
the
goodness
to
take
your
place
first
unless
you
would
prefer
me
to
do
by
no
means
said
de
wardes
i
shall
be
delighted
to
save
you
the
slightest
and
spurring
his
horse
to
a
gallop
he
crossed
the
wide
open
space
and
took
his
stand
at
that
point
of
the
circumference
of
the
immediately
opposite
to
where
de
guiche
was
stationed
de
guiche
remained
motionless
at
this
distance
of
a
hundred
paces
the
two
adversaries
were
absolutely
invisible
to
each
other
being
completely
concealed
by
the
thick
shade
of
elms
and
chestnuts
a
minute
elapsed
amidst
the
profoundest
silence
at
the
end
of
the
minute
each
of
them
in
the
deep
shade
in
which
he
was
concealed
heard
the
double
click
of
the
trigger
as
they
put
the
pistols
on
full
cock
de
guiche
adopting
the
usual
tactics
put
his
horse
to
a
gallop
persuaded
that
he
should
render
his
safety
doubly
sure
by
the
movement
as
well
as
by
the
speed
of
the
animal
he
directed
his
course
in
a
straight
line
towards
the
point
where
in
his
opinion
de
wardes
would
be
stationed
and
he
expected
to
meet
de
wardes
about
but
in
this
he
was
mistaken
he
continued
his
course
presuming
that
his
adversary
was
impatiently
awaiting
his
approach
when
however
he
had
gone
about
of
the
distance
he
beheld
the
trees
suddenly
illuminated
and
a
ball
flew
by
cutting
the
plume
of
his
hat
in
two
nearly
at
the
same
moment
and
as
if
the
flash
of
the
first
shot
had
served
to
indicate
the
direction
of
the
other
a
second
report
was
heard
and
a
second
ball
passed
through
the
head
of
de
guiche
s
horse
a
little
below
the
ear
the
animal
fell
these
two
reports
proceeding
from
the
very
opposite
direction
in
which
he
expected
to
find
de
wardes
surprised
him
a
great
deal
but
as
he
was
a
man
of
amazing
he
prepared
himself
for
his
horse
falling
but
not
so
completely
however
that
the
toe
of
his
boot
escaped
being
caught
under
the
animal
as
it
fell
very
fortunately
the
horse
in
its
dying
agonies
moved
so
as
to
enable
him
to
release
the
leg
which
was
less
entangled
than
the
other
de
guiche
rose
felt
himself
all
over
and
found
that
he
was
not
wounded
at
the
very
moment
he
had
felt
the
horse
tottering
under
him
he
placed
his
pistols
in
the
holsters
afraid
that
the
force
of
the
fall
might
explode
one
at
least
if
not
both
of
them
by
which
he
would
have
been
disarmed
and
left
utterly
without
defense
once
on
his
feet
he
took
the
pistols
out
of
the
holsters
and
advanced
towards
the
spot
where
by
the
light
of
the
flash
he
had
seen
de
wardes
appear
de
wardes
had
at
the
first
shot
accounted
for
the
maneuver
than
which
nothing
could
have
been
simpler
instead
of
advancing
to
meet
de
guiche
or
remaining
in
his
place
to
await
his
approach
de
wardes
had
for
about
fifteen
paces
followed
the
circle
of
the
shadow
which
hid
him
from
his
adversary
s
observation
and
at
the
very
moment
when
the
latter
presented
his
flank
in
his
career
he
had
fired
from
the
place
where
he
stood
carefully
taking
aim
and
assisted
instead
of
being
inconvenienced
by
the
horse
s
gallop
it
has
been
seen
that
notwithstanding
the
darkness
the
first
ball
passed
hardly
more
than
an
inch
above
de
guiche
s
head
de
wardes
had
so
confidently
relied
upon
his
aim
that
he
thought
he
had
seen
de
guiche
fall
his
astonishment
was
extreme
when
he
saw
he
still
remained
erect
in
his
saddle
he
hastened
to
fire
his
second
shot
but
his
hand
trembled
and
he
killed
the
horse
instead
it
would
be
a
most
fortunate
chance
for
him
if
de
guiche
were
to
remain
held
fast
under
the
animal
before
he
could
have
freed
himself
de
wardes
would
have
loaded
his
pistol
and
had
de
guiche
at
his
mercy
but
de
guiche
on
the
contrary
was
up
and
had
three
shots
to
fire
de
guiche
immediately
understood
the
position
of
affairs
it
would
be
necessary
to
exceed
de
wardes
in
rapidity
of
execution
he
advanced
therefore
so
as
to
reach
him
before
he
should
have
had
time
to
reload
his
pistol
de
wardes
saw
him
approaching
like
a
tempest
the
ball
was
rather
tight
and
offered
some
resistance
to
the
ramrod
to
load
carelessly
would
be
simply
to
lose
his
last
chance
to
take
the
proper
care
in
loading
meant
fatal
loss
of
time
or
rather
throwing
away
his
life
he
made
his
horse
bound
on
one
side
de
guiche
turned
round
also
and
at
the
moment
the
horse
was
quiet
again
fired
and
the
ball
carried
off
de
wardes
s
hat
from
his
head
de
wardes
now
knew
that
he
had
a
moment
s
time
at
his
own
disposal
he
availed
himself
of
it
in
order
to
finish
loading
his
pistol
de
guiche
noticing
that
his
adversary
did
not
fall
threw
the
pistol
he
had
just
discharged
aside
and
walked
straight
towards
de
wardes
elevating
the
second
pistol
as
he
did
so
he
had
hardly
proceeded
more
than
two
or
three
paces
when
de
wardes
took
aim
at
him
as
he
was
walking
and
fired
an
exclamation
of
anger
was
de
guiche
s
answer
the
comte
s
arm
contracted
and
dropped
motionless
by
his
side
and
the
pistol
fell
from
his
grasp
his
anxiety
was
excessive
i
am
lost
murmured
de
wardes
he
is
not
mortally
at
the
very
moment
however
de
guiche
was
about
to
raise
his
pistol
against
de
wardes
the
head
shoulders
and
limbs
of
the
comte
seemed
to
collapse
he
heaved
a
sigh
tottered
and
fell
at
the
feet
of
de
wardes
s
horse
that
is
all
right
said
de
wardes
and
gathering
up
the
reins
he
struck
his
spurs
into
the
horse
s
sides
the
horse
cleared
the
comte
s
motionless
body
and
bore
de
wardes
rapidly
back
to
the
chateau
when
he
arrived
there
he
remained
a
quarter
of
an
hour
deliberating
within
himself
as
to
the
proper
course
to
be
adopted
in
his
impatience
to
leave
the
field
of
battle
he
had
omitted
to
ascertain
whether
de
guiche
were
dead
or
not
a
double
hypothesis
presented
itself
to
de
wardes
s
agitated
mind
either
de
guiche
was
killed
or
de
guiche
was
wounded
only
if
he
were
killed
why
should
he
leave
his
body
in
that
manner
to
the
tender
mercies
of
the
wolves
it
was
a
perfectly
useless
piece
of
cruelty
for
if
de
guiche
were
dead
he
certainly
could
not
breathe
a
syllable
of
what
had
passed
if
he
were
not
killed
why
should
he
de
wardes
in
leaving
him
there
uncared
for
allow
himself
to
be
regarded
as
a
savage
incapable
of
one
generous
feeling
this
last
consideration
determined
his
line
of
conduct
de
wardes
immediately
instituted
inquires
after
manicamp
he
was
told
that
manicamp
had
been
looking
after
de
guiche
and
not
knowing
where
to
find
him
had
retired
to
bed
de
wardes
went
and
awoke
the
sleeper
without
any
delay
and
related
the
whole
affair
to
him
which
manicamp
listened
to
in
perfect
silence
but
with
an
expression
of
momentarily
increasing
energy
of
which
his
face
could
hardly
have
been
supposed
capable
it
was
only
when
de
wardes
had
finished
that
manicamp
uttered
the
words
let
us
as
they
proceeded
manicamp
became
more
and
more
excited
and
in
proportion
as
de
wardes
related
the
details
of
the
affair
to
him
his
countenance
assumed
every
moment
a
darker
expression
and
so
he
said
when
de
wardes
had
finished
you
think
he
is
dead
alas
i
and
you
fought
in
that
manner
without
witnesses
he
insisted
upon
it
is
very
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
it
is
singular
that
it
is
very
unlike
monsieur
de
guiche
s
you
do
not
doubt
my
word
i
suppose
hum
hum
you
do
doubt
it
then
a
little
but
i
shall
doubt
it
more
than
ever
i
warn
you
if
i
find
the
poor
fellow
is
really
monsieur
manicamp
monsieur
de
wardes
it
seems
you
intend
to
insult
just
as
you
please
the
fact
is
i
never
did
like
people
who
come
and
say
i
have
killed
such
and
such
a
gentleman
in
a
corner
it
is
a
great
pity
but
i
killed
him
in
a
perfectly
honorable
it
has
an
ugly
appearance
de
silence
we
have
in
fact
the
glade
could
now
be
seen
and
in
the
open
space
lay
the
motionless
body
of
the
dead
horse
to
the
right
of
the
horse
upon
the
dark
grass
with
his
face
against
the
ground
the
poor
comte
lay
bathed
in
his
blood
he
had
remained
in
the
same
spot
and
did
not
even
seem
to
have
made
the
slightest
movement
manicamp
threw
himself
on
his
knees
lifted
the
comte
in
his
arms
and
found
him
quite
cold
and
steeped
in
blood
he
let
him
gently
fall
again
then
stretching
out
his
hand
and
feeling
all
over
the
ground
close
to
where
the
comte
lay
he
sought
until
he
found
de
guiche
s
pistol
by
heaven
he
said
rising
to
his
feet
pale
as
death
and
with
the
pistol
in
his
hand
you
are
not
mistaken
he
is
quite
dead
repeated
de
wardes
yes
and
his
pistol
is
still
loaded
added
manicamp
looking
into
the
pan
but
i
told
you
that
i
took
aim
as
he
was
walking
towards
me
and
fired
at
him
at
the
very
moment
he
was
going
to
fire
at
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
fought
with
him
monsieur
de
wardes
i
confess
that
i
am
very
much
afraid
it
has
been
a
foul
assassination
nay
nay
no
exclamations
you
have
had
your
three
shots
and
his
pistol
is
still
loaded
you
have
killed
his
horse
and
he
de
guiche
one
of
the
best
marksmen
in
france
has
not
touched
even
either
your
horse
or
yourself
well
monsieur
de
wardes
you
have
been
very
unlucky
in
bringing
me
here
all
the
blood
in
my
body
seems
to
have
mounted
to
my
head
and
i
verily
believe
that
since
so
good
an
opportunity
presents
itself
i
shall
blow
your
brains
out
on
the
spot
so
monsieur
de
wardes
recommend
yourself
to
monsieur
manicamp
you
can
not
think
of
such
a
thing
on
the
contrary
i
am
thinking
of
it
very
would
you
assassinate
me
without
the
slightest
remorse
at
least
for
the
are
you
a
gentleman
i
have
given
a
great
many
proofs
of
let
me
defend
my
life
then
at
very
likely
in
order
i
suppose
that
you
may
do
to
me
what
you
have
done
to
poor
de
and
manicamp
slowly
raised
his
pistol
to
the
height
of
de
wardes
s
breast
and
with
arm
stretched
out
and
a
fixed
determined
look
on
his
face
took
a
careful
aim
de
wardes
did
not
attempt
a
flight
he
was
completely
terrified
in
the
midst
however
of
this
horrible
silence
which
lasted
about
a
second
but
which
seemed
an
age
to
de
wardes
a
faint
sigh
was
heard
oh
exclaimed
de
wardes
he
still
lives
help
de
guiche
i
am
about
to
be
assassinated
manicamp
fell
back
a
step
or
two
and
the
two
young
men
saw
the
comte
raise
himself
slowly
and
painfully
upon
one
hand
manicamp
threw
the
pistol
away
a
dozen
paces
and
ran
to
his
friend
uttering
a
cry
of
delight
de
wardes
wiped
his
forehead
which
was
covered
with
a
cold
perspiration
it
was
just
in
time
he
murmured
where
are
you
hurt
inquired
manicamp
of
de
guiche
and
whereabouts
are
you
wounded
de
guiche
showed
him
his
mutilated
hand
and
his
chest
covered
with
blood
comte
exclaimed
de
wardes
i
am
accused
of
having
assassinated
you
speak
i
implore
you
and
say
that
i
fought
perfectly
so
said
the
wounded
man
monsieur
de
wardes
fought
quite
loyally
and
whoever
says
the
contrary
will
make
an
enemy
of
then
sir
said
manicamp
assist
me
in
the
first
place
to
carry
this
gentleman
home
and
i
will
afterwards
give
you
every
satisfaction
you
please
or
if
you
are
in
a
hurry
we
can
do
better
still
let
us
stanch
the
blood
from
the
comte
s
wounds
here
with
your
and
mine
and
then
as
there
are
two
shots
left
we
can
have
them
between
thank
you
said
de
wardes
twice
already
in
one
hour
i
have
seen
death
too
close
at
hand
to
be
agreeable
i
don
t
like
his
look
at
all
and
i
prefer
your
manicamp
burst
out
laughing
and
guiche
too
in
spite
of
his
sufferings
the
two
young
men
wished
to
carry
him
but
he
declared
he
felt
quite
strong
enough
to
walk
alone
the
ball
had
broken
his
and
his
little
finger
and
then
had
glanced
along
his
side
but
without
penetrating
deeply
into
his
chest
it
was
the
pain
rather
than
the
seriousness
of
the
wound
therefore
which
had
overcome
de
guiche
manicamp
passed
his
arm
under
one
of
the
count
s
shoulders
and
de
wardes
did
the
same
with
the
other
and
in
this
way
they
brought
him
back
to
fontainebleau
to
the
house
of
the
same
doctor
who
had
been
present
at
the
death
of
the
franciscan
aramis
s
predecessor
chapter
xiv
the
king
s
supper
the
king
while
these
matters
were
being
arranged
was
sitting
at
the
and
the
not
very
large
number
of
guests
for
that
day
had
taken
their
seats
too
after
the
usual
gesture
intimating
the
royal
permission
at
this
period
of
louis
s
reign
although
etiquette
was
not
governed
by
the
strict
regulations
subsequently
adopted
the
french
court
had
entirely
thrown
aside
the
traditions
of
and
patriarchal
affability
existing
in
the
time
of
henry
which
the
suspicious
mind
of
louis
xiii
had
gradually
replaced
with
pompous
state
and
ceremony
which
he
despaired
of
being
able
fully
to
realize
the
king
therefore
was
seated
alone
at
a
small
separate
table
which
like
the
desk
of
a
president
overlooked
the
adjoining
tables
although
we
say
a
small
table
we
must
not
omit
to
add
that
this
small
table
was
the
largest
one
there
moreover
it
was
the
one
on
which
were
placed
the
greatest
number
and
quantity
of
dishes
consisting
of
fish
game
meat
fruit
vegetables
and
preserves
the
king
was
young
and
full
of
vigor
and
energy
very
fond
of
hunting
addicted
to
all
violent
exercises
of
the
body
possessing
besides
like
all
the
members
of
the
bourbon
family
a
rapid
digestion
and
an
appetite
speedily
renewed
louis
xiv
was
a
formidable
he
delighted
in
criticising
his
cooks
but
when
he
honored
them
by
praise
and
commendation
the
honor
was
overwhelming
the
king
began
by
eating
several
kinds
of
soup
either
mixed
together
or
taken
separately
he
intermixed
or
rather
separated
each
of
the
soups
by
a
glass
of
old
wine
he
ate
quickly
and
somewhat
greedily
porthos
who
from
the
beginning
had
out
of
respect
been
waiting
for
a
jog
of
d
artagnan
s
arm
seeing
the
king
make
such
rapid
progress
turned
to
the
musketeer
and
said
in
a
low
voice
it
seems
as
if
one
might
go
on
now
his
majesty
is
very
encouraging
from
the
example
he
sets
the
king
eats
said
d
artagnan
but
he
talks
at
the
same
time
try
and
manage
matters
in
such
a
manner
that
if
he
should
happen
to
address
a
remark
to
you
he
will
not
find
you
with
your
mouth
full
which
would
be
very
the
best
way
in
that
case
said
porthos
is
to
eat
no
supper
at
all
and
yet
i
am
very
hungry
i
admit
and
everything
looks
and
smells
most
invitingly
as
if
appealing
to
all
my
senses
at
don
t
think
of
not
eating
for
a
moment
said
d
artagnan
that
would
put
his
majesty
out
terribly
the
king
has
a
saying
that
he
who
works
well
eats
well
and
he
does
not
like
people
to
eat
indifferently
at
his
how
can
i
avoid
having
my
mouth
full
if
i
eat
said
porthos
all
you
have
to
do
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
is
simply
to
swallow
what
you
have
in
it
whenever
the
king
does
you
the
honor
to
address
a
remark
to
very
good
said
porthos
and
from
that
moment
he
began
to
eat
with
a
certain
enthusiasm
the
king
occasionally
looked
at
the
different
persons
who
were
at
table
with
him
and
could
appreciate
the
different
dispositions
of
his
guests
monsieur
du
vallon
he
said
porthos
was
enjoying
a
de
and
swallowed
half
of
the
back
his
name
pronounced
in
such
a
manner
made
him
start
and
by
a
vigorous
effort
of
his
gullet
he
absorbed
the
whole
mouthful
sire
replied
porthos
in
a
stifled
voice
but
sufficiently
intelligible
nevertheless
let
those
d
be
handed
to
monsieur
du
vallon
said
the
king
do
you
like
brown
meats
du
vallon
sire
i
like
everything
replied
porthos
d
artagnan
whispered
everything
your
majesty
sends
porthos
repeated
everything
your
majesty
sends
me
an
observation
which
the
king
apparently
received
with
great
satisfaction
people
eat
well
who
work
well
replied
the
king
delighted
to
have
a
guest
who
could
eat
as
porthos
did
porthos
received
the
dish
of
lamb
and
put
a
portion
of
it
on
his
plate
well
said
the
king
exquisite
said
porthos
calmly
have
you
as
good
mutton
in
your
part
of
the
country
monsieur
du
vallon
continued
the
king
sire
i
believe
that
from
my
own
province
as
everywhere
else
the
best
of
everything
is
sent
to
paris
for
your
majesty
s
use
but
on
the
other
hand
i
do
not
eat
lamb
in
the
same
way
your
majesty
ah
ah
and
how
do
you
eat
it
generally
i
have
a
lamb
dressed
yes
in
what
manner
monsieur
du
vallon
in
this
sire
my
cook
who
is
a
german
first
stuffs
the
lamb
in
question
with
small
sausages
he
procures
from
strasburg
balls
from
troyes
and
larks
from
pithiviers
by
some
means
or
other
which
i
am
not
acquainted
with
he
bones
the
lamb
as
he
would
do
a
fowl
leaving
the
skin
on
however
which
forms
a
brown
crust
all
over
the
animal
when
it
is
cut
in
beautiful
slices
in
the
same
way
as
an
enormous
sausage
a
gravy
pours
forth
which
is
as
agreeable
to
the
eye
as
it
is
exquisite
to
the
and
porthos
finished
by
smacking
his
lips
the
king
opened
his
eyes
with
delight
and
while
cutting
some
of
the
en
which
was
being
handed
to
him
he
said
that
is
a
dish
i
should
very
much
like
to
taste
monsieur
du
vallon
is
it
possible
a
whole
lamb
absolutely
an
entire
lamb
pass
those
pheasants
to
du
vallon
i
perceive
he
is
an
the
order
was
immediately
obeyed
then
continuing
the
conversation
he
said
and
you
do
not
find
the
lamb
too
fat
no
sire
the
fat
falls
down
at
the
same
time
as
the
gravy
does
and
swims
on
the
surface
then
the
servant
who
carves
removes
the
fat
with
a
spoon
which
i
have
had
expressly
made
for
that
where
do
you
reside
inquired
the
king
at
pierrefonds
at
pierrefonds
where
is
that
du
vallon
near
oh
no
sire
pierrefonds
is
in
the
i
thought
you
alluded
to
the
lamb
on
account
of
the
salt
no
sire
i
have
marshes
which
are
not
salt
it
is
true
but
which
are
not
the
less
valuable
on
that
the
king
had
now
arrived
at
the
but
without
losing
sight
of
porthos
who
continued
to
play
his
part
in
the
best
manner
you
have
an
excellent
appetite
du
vallon
said
the
king
and
you
make
an
admirable
guest
at
ah
sire
if
your
majesty
were
ever
to
pay
a
visit
to
pierrefonds
we
would
both
of
us
eat
our
lamb
together
for
your
appetite
is
not
an
indifferent
one
by
any
d
artagnan
gave
porthos
a
kick
under
the
table
which
made
porthos
color
up
at
your
majesty
s
present
happy
age
said
porthos
in
order
to
repair
the
mistake
he
had
made
i
was
in
the
musketeers
and
nothing
could
ever
satisfy
me
then
your
majesty
has
an
excellent
appetite
as
i
have
already
had
the
honor
of
mentioning
but
you
select
what
you
eat
with
quite
too
much
refinement
to
be
called
for
one
moment
a
great
the
king
seemed
charmed
at
his
guest
s
politeness
will
you
try
some
of
these
creams
he
said
to
porthos
sire
you
majesty
treats
me
with
far
too
much
kindness
to
prevent
me
speaking
the
whole
pray
do
so
du
will
sire
with
regard
to
sweet
dishes
i
only
recognize
pastry
and
even
that
should
be
rather
solid
all
these
frothy
substances
swell
the
stomach
and
occupy
a
space
which
seems
to
me
to
be
too
precious
to
be
so
badly
ah
gentlemen
said
the
king
indicating
porthos
by
a
gesture
here
is
indeed
a
model
of
gastronomy
it
was
in
such
a
manner
that
our
fathers
who
so
well
knew
what
good
living
was
used
to
while
we
added
his
majesty
do
nothing
but
tantalize
with
our
and
as
he
spoke
he
took
the
breast
of
a
chicken
with
ham
while
porthos
attacked
a
dish
of
partridges
and
quails
the
filled
his
majesty
s
glass
give
du
vallon
some
of
my
wine
said
the
king
this
was
one
of
the
greatest
honors
of
the
royal
table
d
artagnan
pressed
his
friend
s
knee
if
you
could
only
manage
to
swallow
the
half
of
that
boar
s
head
i
see
yonder
said
he
to
porthos
i
shall
believe
you
will
be
a
duke
and
peer
within
the
next
presently
said
porthos
phlegmatically
i
shall
come
to
that
by
and
in
fact
it
was
not
long
before
it
came
to
the
boar
s
turn
for
the
king
seemed
to
take
pleasure
in
urging
on
his
guest
he
did
not
pass
any
of
the
dishes
to
porthos
until
he
had
tasted
them
himself
and
he
accordingly
took
some
of
the
boar
s
head
porthos
showed
that
he
could
keep
pace
with
his
sovereign
and
instead
of
eating
the
half
as
d
artagnan
had
told
him
he
ate
of
it
it
is
impossible
said
the
king
in
an
undertone
that
a
gentleman
who
eats
so
good
a
supper
every
day
and
who
has
such
beautiful
teeth
can
be
otherwise
than
the
most
straightforward
upright
man
in
my
do
you
hear
said
d
artagnan
in
his
friend
s
ear
yes
i
think
i
am
rather
in
favor
said
porthos
balancing
himself
on
his
chair
oh
you
are
in
luck
s
the
king
and
porthos
continued
to
eat
in
the
same
manner
to
the
great
satisfaction
of
the
other
guests
some
of
whom
from
emulation
had
attempted
to
follow
them
but
were
obliged
to
give
up
the
king
soon
began
to
get
flushed
and
the
reaction
of
the
blood
to
his
face
announced
that
the
moment
of
repletion
had
arrived
it
was
then
that
louis
instead
of
becoming
gay
and
cheerful
as
most
good
livers
generally
do
became
dull
melancholy
and
taciturn
porthos
on
the
contrary
was
lively
and
communicative
d
artagnan
s
foot
had
more
than
once
to
remind
him
of
this
peculiarity
of
the
king
the
dessert
now
made
its
appearance
the
king
had
ceased
to
think
anything
further
of
porthos
he
turned
his
eyes
anxiously
towards
the
and
he
was
heard
occasionally
to
inquire
how
it
happened
that
monsieur
de
was
so
long
in
arriving
at
last
at
the
moment
when
his
majesty
was
finishing
a
pot
of
preserved
plums
with
a
deep
sigh
appeared
the
king
s
eyes
which
had
become
somewhat
dull
immediately
began
to
sparkle
the
comte
advanced
towards
the
king
s
table
and
louis
rose
at
his
approach
everybody
got
up
at
the
same
time
including
porthos
who
was
just
finishing
an
capable
of
making
the
jaws
of
a
crocodile
stick
together
the
supper
was
over
chapter
xv
after
supper
the
king
took
by
the
arm
and
passed
into
the
adjoining
apartment
what
has
detained
you
comte
said
the
king
i
was
bringing
the
answer
sire
replied
the
comte
she
has
taken
a
long
time
to
reply
to
what
i
wrote
sire
your
majesty
deigned
to
write
in
verse
and
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
wished
to
repay
your
majesty
in
the
same
coin
that
is
to
say
in
verses
exclaimed
the
king
in
ecstasy
give
them
to
me
at
and
louis
broke
the
seal
of
a
little
letter
inclosing
the
verses
which
history
has
preserved
entire
for
us
and
which
are
more
meritorious
in
invention
than
in
execution
such
as
they
were
however
the
king
was
enchanted
with
them
and
exhibited
his
satisfaction
by
unequivocal
transports
of
delight
but
the
universal
silence
which
reigned
in
the
rooms
warned
louis
so
sensitively
particular
with
regard
to
good
breeding
that
his
delight
must
give
rise
to
various
interpretations
he
turned
aside
and
put
the
note
in
his
pocket
and
then
advancing
a
few
steps
which
brought
him
again
to
the
threshold
of
the
door
close
to
his
guests
he
said
m
du
vallon
i
have
seen
you
with
the
greatest
pleasure
and
my
pleasure
will
be
equally
great
to
see
you
porthos
bowed
as
the
colossus
of
rhodes
would
have
done
and
retired
from
the
room
with
his
face
towards
the
king
m
d
artagnan
continued
the
king
you
will
await
my
orders
in
the
gallery
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
having
made
me
acquainted
with
du
vallon
gentlemen
addressing
himself
to
the
other
guests
i
return
to
paris
on
account
of
the
departure
of
the
spanish
and
dutch
ambassadors
until
the
apartment
was
immediately
cleared
of
the
guests
the
king
took
by
the
arm
made
him
read
la
valliere
s
verses
over
again
and
said
what
do
you
think
of
them
charming
they
charm
me
in
fact
and
if
they
were
known
oh
the
professional
poets
would
be
jealous
of
them
but
it
is
not
likely
they
will
know
anything
about
did
you
give
her
mine
oh
sire
she
positively
devoured
they
were
very
weak
i
am
that
is
not
what
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
said
of
do
you
think
she
was
pleased
with
them
i
am
sure
of
it
i
must
answer
oh
sire
immediately
after
supper
your
majesty
will
fatigue
you
are
quite
right
study
after
eating
is
notoriously
the
labor
of
a
poet
especially
so
and
besides
there
is
great
excitement
prevailing
at
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
what
do
you
mean
with
her
as
with
all
the
ladies
of
the
why
on
account
of
poor
de
guiche
s
has
anything
serious
happened
to
de
guiche
then
yes
sire
he
has
one
hand
nearly
destroyed
a
hole
in
his
breast
in
fact
he
is
good
heavens
who
told
you
that
manicamp
brought
him
back
just
now
to
the
house
of
a
doctor
here
in
fontainebleau
and
the
rumor
soon
reached
us
brought
back
poor
de
guiche
and
how
did
it
happen
ah
that
is
the
very
question
how
did
it
happen
you
say
that
in
a
very
singular
manner
give
me
the
details
what
does
he
say
himself
he
says
nothing
sire
but
others
what
others
those
who
brought
him
back
who
are
they
i
do
not
know
sire
but
de
manicamp
knows
de
manicamp
is
one
of
his
as
everybody
is
indeed
said
the
king
oh
no
returned
you
are
mistaken
sire
every
one
is
not
precisely
a
friend
of
de
how
do
you
know
that
does
your
majesty
require
me
to
explain
myself
certainly
i
well
sire
i
believe
i
have
heard
something
said
about
a
quarrel
between
two
when
this
very
evening
before
your
majesty
s
supper
was
that
can
hardly
be
i
have
issued
such
stringent
and
severe
ordinances
with
respect
to
duelling
that
no
one
i
presume
would
dare
to
disobey
in
that
case
heaven
preserve
me
from
excusing
any
one
exclaimed
your
majesty
commanded
me
to
speak
and
i
spoke
tell
me
then
in
what
way
the
comte
de
guiche
has
been
wounded
sire
it
is
said
to
have
been
at
a
this
evening
yes
one
of
his
hands
shattered
and
a
hole
in
his
breast
who
was
at
the
hunt
with
de
guiche
i
do
not
know
sire
but
de
manicamp
knows
or
ought
to
you
are
concealing
something
from
me
nothing
sire
i
assure
then
explain
to
me
how
the
accident
happened
was
it
a
musket
that
burst
very
likely
sire
but
yet
on
reflection
it
could
hardly
have
been
that
for
de
guiche
s
pistol
was
found
close
by
him
still
his
pistol
but
a
man
does
not
go
to
a
with
a
pistol
i
should
sire
it
is
also
said
that
de
guiche
s
horse
was
killed
and
that
the
horse
is
still
to
be
found
in
the
wide
open
glade
in
the
his
horse
guiche
go
on
horseback
to
a
i
do
not
understand
a
syllable
of
what
you
have
been
telling
me
where
did
this
affair
happen
at
the
in
that
part
of
the
forest
called
the
that
will
do
call
d
obeyed
and
the
musketeer
entered
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
king
you
will
leave
this
place
by
the
little
door
of
the
private
yes
you
will
mount
your
yes
and
you
will
proceed
to
the
du
do
you
know
the
spot
yes
sire
i
have
fought
there
what
exclaimed
the
king
amazed
at
the
reply
under
the
edicts
sire
of
cardinal
richelieu
returned
d
artagnan
with
his
usual
impassability
that
is
very
different
monsieur
you
will
therefore
go
there
and
will
examine
the
locality
very
carefully
a
man
has
been
wounded
there
and
you
will
find
a
horse
lying
dead
you
will
tell
me
what
your
opinion
is
upon
the
whole
very
good
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
your
own
opinion
i
require
and
not
that
of
any
one
you
shall
have
it
in
an
hour
s
time
i
prohibit
your
speaking
with
any
one
whoever
it
may
except
with
the
person
who
must
give
me
a
lantern
said
d
artagnan
oh
that
is
a
matter
of
course
said
the
king
laughing
at
the
liberty
which
he
tolerated
in
no
one
but
his
captain
of
the
musketeers
d
artagnan
left
by
the
little
staircase
now
let
my
physician
be
sent
for
said
louis
ten
minutes
afterwards
the
king
s
physician
arrived
quite
out
of
breath
you
will
go
monsieur
said
the
king
to
him
and
accompany
de
wherever
he
may
take
you
you
will
render
me
an
account
of
the
state
of
the
person
you
may
see
in
the
house
you
will
be
taken
the
physician
obeyed
without
a
remark
as
at
that
time
people
began
to
obey
louis
and
left
the
room
preceding
do
you
send
manicamp
to
me
before
the
physician
can
possibly
have
spoken
to
and
left
in
his
turn
chapter
xvi
showing
in
what
way
d
artagnan
discharged
the
mission
with
which
the
king
had
intrusted
him
while
the
king
was
engaged
in
making
these
arrangements
in
order
to
ascertain
the
truth
d
artagnan
without
losing
a
second
ran
to
the
stable
took
down
the
lantern
saddled
his
horse
himself
and
proceeded
towards
the
place
his
majesty
had
indicated
according
to
the
promise
he
had
made
he
had
not
accosted
any
one
and
as
we
have
observed
he
had
carried
his
scruples
so
far
as
to
do
without
the
assistance
of
the
altogether
d
artagnan
was
one
of
those
who
in
moments
of
difficulty
pride
themselves
on
increasing
their
own
value
by
dint
of
hard
galloping
he
in
less
than
five
minutes
reached
the
wood
fastened
his
horse
to
the
first
tree
he
came
to
and
penetrated
to
the
broad
open
space
on
foot
he
then
began
to
inspect
most
carefully
on
foot
and
with
his
lantern
in
his
hand
the
whole
surface
of
the
went
forward
turned
back
again
measured
examined
and
after
half
an
hour
s
minute
inspection
he
returned
silently
to
where
he
had
left
his
horse
and
pursued
his
way
in
deep
reflection
and
at
a
to
fontainebleau
louis
was
waiting
in
his
cabinet
he
was
alone
and
with
a
pencil
was
scribbling
on
paper
certain
lines
which
d
artagnan
at
the
first
glance
recognized
as
unequal
and
very
much
touched
up
the
conclusion
he
arrived
at
was
that
they
must
be
verses
the
king
raised
his
head
and
perceived
d
artagnan
well
monsieur
he
said
do
you
bring
me
any
news
yes
what
have
you
seen
as
far
as
probability
goes
sire
d
artagnan
began
to
reply
it
was
certainty
i
requested
of
i
will
approach
it
as
near
as
i
possibly
can
the
weather
was
very
well
adapted
for
investigations
of
the
character
i
have
just
made
it
has
been
raining
this
evening
and
the
roads
were
wet
and
muddy
well
the
result
d
artagnan
sire
your
majesty
told
me
that
there
was
a
horse
lying
dead
in
the
of
the
and
i
began
therefore
by
studying
the
roads
i
say
the
roads
because
the
center
of
the
is
reached
by
four
separate
roads
the
one
that
i
myself
took
was
the
only
one
that
presented
any
fresh
traces
two
horses
had
followed
it
side
by
side
their
eight
feet
were
marked
very
distinctly
in
the
clay
one
of
the
riders
was
more
impatient
than
the
other
for
the
footprints
of
the
one
were
invariably
in
advance
of
the
other
about
half
a
horse
s
are
you
quite
sure
they
were
traveling
together
said
the
king
yes
sire
the
horses
are
two
rather
large
animals
of
equal
pace
horses
well
used
to
maneuvers
of
all
kinds
for
they
wheeled
round
the
barrier
of
the
well
and
after
the
two
cavaliers
paused
there
for
a
minute
no
doubt
to
arrange
the
conditions
of
the
engagement
the
horses
grew
restless
and
impatient
one
of
the
riders
spoke
while
the
other
listened
and
seemed
to
have
contented
himself
by
simply
answering
his
horse
pawed
the
ground
which
proves
that
his
attention
was
so
taken
up
by
listening
that
he
let
the
bridle
fall
from
his
a
hostile
meeting
did
take
place
then
continue
you
are
a
very
accurate
one
of
the
two
cavaliers
remained
where
he
was
standing
the
one
in
fact
who
had
been
listening
the
other
crossed
the
open
space
and
at
first
placed
himself
directly
opposite
to
his
adversary
the
one
who
had
remained
stationary
traversed
the
at
a
gallop
about
of
its
length
thinking
that
by
this
means
he
would
gain
upon
his
opponent
but
the
latter
had
followed
the
circumference
of
the
you
are
ignorant
of
their
names
i
suppose
completely
so
sire
only
he
who
followed
the
circumference
of
the
wood
was
mounted
on
a
black
how
do
you
know
that
i
found
a
few
hairs
of
his
tail
among
the
brambles
which
bordered
the
sides
of
the
go
as
for
the
other
horse
there
can
be
no
trouble
in
describing
him
since
he
was
left
dead
on
the
field
of
what
was
the
cause
of
his
death
a
ball
which
had
passed
through
his
was
the
ball
that
of
a
pistol
or
a
gun
it
was
a
sire
besides
the
manner
in
which
the
horse
was
wounded
explained
to
me
the
tactics
of
the
man
who
had
killed
it
he
had
followed
the
circumference
of
the
wood
in
order
to
take
his
adversary
in
flank
moreover
i
followed
his
on
the
the
tracks
of
the
black
horse
do
you
mean
yes
go
on
monsieur
d
as
your
majesty
now
perceives
the
position
of
the
two
adversaries
i
will
for
a
moment
leave
the
cavalier
who
had
remained
stationary
for
the
one
who
started
off
at
a
do
the
horse
of
the
cavalier
who
rode
at
full
speed
was
killed
on
the
how
do
you
know
that
the
cavalier
had
not
time
even
to
throw
himself
off
his
horse
and
so
fell
with
it
i
observed
the
impression
of
his
leg
which
with
a
great
effort
he
was
enabled
to
extricate
from
under
the
horse
the
spur
pressed
down
by
the
weight
of
the
animal
had
plowed
up
the
very
good
and
what
did
he
do
as
soon
as
he
rose
up
again
he
walked
straight
up
to
his
who
still
remained
upon
the
verge
of
the
forest
yes
sire
then
having
reached
a
favorable
distance
he
stopped
firmly
for
the
impression
of
both
his
heels
are
left
in
the
ground
quite
close
to
each
other
fired
and
missed
his
how
do
you
know
he
did
not
hit
him
i
found
a
hat
with
a
ball
through
ah
a
proof
then
exclaimed
the
king
insufficient
sire
replied
d
artagnan
coldly
it
is
a
hat
without
any
letters
indicating
its
ownership
without
arms
a
red
feather
as
all
hats
have
the
lace
even
had
nothing
particular
in
did
the
man
with
the
hat
through
which
the
bullet
had
passed
fire
a
second
time
oh
sire
he
had
already
fired
how
did
you
ascertain
that
i
found
the
waddings
of
the
and
what
became
of
the
bullet
which
did
not
kill
the
horse
it
cut
in
two
the
feather
of
the
hat
belonging
to
him
against
whom
it
was
directed
and
broke
a
small
birch
at
the
other
end
of
the
open
in
that
case
then
the
man
on
the
black
horse
was
disarmed
whilst
his
adversary
had
still
one
more
shot
to
fire
sire
while
the
dismounted
rider
was
extricating
himself
from
his
horse
the
other
was
reloading
his
pistol
only
he
was
much
agitated
while
he
was
loading
it
and
his
hand
trembled
how
do
you
know
that
half
the
charge
fell
to
the
ground
and
he
threw
the
ramrod
aside
not
having
time
to
replace
it
in
the
monsieur
d
artagnan
this
is
marvellous
you
tell
it
is
only
close
observation
sire
and
the
commonest
highwayman
could
tell
as
the
whole
scene
is
before
me
from
the
manner
in
which
you
relate
i
have
in
fact
reconstructed
it
in
my
own
mind
with
merely
a
few
and
now
said
the
king
let
us
return
to
the
dismounted
cavalier
you
were
saying
that
he
walked
towards
his
adversary
while
the
latter
was
loading
his
yes
but
at
the
very
moment
he
himself
was
taking
aim
the
other
oh
said
the
king
and
the
shot
the
shot
told
terribly
sire
the
dismounted
cavalier
fell
upon
his
face
after
having
staggered
forward
three
or
four
where
was
he
hit
in
two
places
in
the
first
place
in
his
right
hand
and
then
by
the
same
bullet
in
his
but
how
could
you
ascertain
that
inquired
the
king
full
of
admiration
by
a
very
simple
means
the
butt
end
of
the
pistol
was
covered
with
blood
and
the
trace
of
the
bullet
could
be
observed
with
fragments
of
a
broken
ring
the
wounded
man
in
all
probability
had
the
and
the
little
finger
carried
as
far
as
the
hand
goes
i
have
nothing
to
say
but
the
chest
sire
there
were
two
small
pools
of
blood
at
a
distance
of
about
two
feet
and
a
half
from
each
other
at
one
of
these
pools
of
blood
the
grass
was
torn
up
by
the
clenched
hand
at
the
other
the
grass
was
simply
pressed
down
by
the
weight
of
the
poor
de
guiche
exclaimed
the
king
ah
it
was
de
guiche
then
said
the
musketeer
quietly
i
suspected
it
but
did
not
venture
to
mention
it
to
your
and
what
made
you
suspect
it
i
recognized
the
de
gramont
arms
upon
the
holsters
of
the
dead
and
you
think
he
is
seriously
wounded
very
seriously
since
he
fell
immediately
and
remained
a
long
time
in
the
same
place
however
he
was
able
to
walk
as
he
left
the
spot
supported
by
two
you
met
him
returning
then
no
but
i
observed
the
footprints
of
three
men
the
one
on
the
right
and
the
one
on
the
left
walked
freely
and
easily
but
the
one
in
the
middle
dragged
his
feet
as
he
walked
besides
he
left
traces
of
blood
at
every
step
he
now
monsieur
since
you
saw
the
combat
so
distinctly
that
not
a
single
detail
seems
to
have
escaped
you
tell
me
something
about
de
guiche
s
oh
sire
i
do
not
know
and
yet
you
see
everything
very
yes
sire
i
see
everything
but
i
do
not
tell
all
i
see
and
since
the
poor
devil
has
escaped
your
majesty
will
permit
me
to
say
that
i
do
not
intend
to
denounce
and
yet
he
is
guilty
since
he
has
fought
a
duel
not
guilty
in
my
eyes
sire
said
d
artagnan
coldly
monsieur
exclaimed
the
king
are
you
aware
of
what
you
are
saying
perfectly
sire
but
according
to
my
notions
a
man
who
fights
a
duel
is
a
brave
man
such
at
least
is
my
own
opinion
but
your
majesty
may
have
another
it
is
but
natural
for
you
are
master
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
ordered
you
however
d
artagnan
interrupted
the
king
by
a
respectful
gesture
you
ordered
me
sire
to
gather
what
particulars
i
could
respecting
a
hostile
meeting
that
had
taken
place
those
particulars
you
have
if
you
order
me
to
arrest
de
guiche
s
adversary
i
will
do
so
but
do
not
order
me
to
denounce
him
to
you
for
in
that
case
i
will
not
very
well
arrest
him
give
me
his
name
the
king
stamped
his
foot
angrily
but
after
a
moment
s
reflection
he
said
you
are
right
ten
times
twenty
times
a
hundred
times
that
is
my
opinion
sire
i
am
happy
that
this
time
it
accords
with
your
majesty
one
word
more
who
assisted
guiche
i
do
not
know
but
you
speak
of
two
men
there
was
a
person
present
then
as
there
was
no
second
sire
nay
more
than
that
when
de
guiche
fell
his
adversary
fled
without
giving
him
any
the
miserable
coward
exclaimed
the
king
the
consequence
of
your
ordinances
sire
if
a
man
has
fought
well
and
fairly
and
has
already
escaped
one
chance
of
death
he
naturally
wishes
to
escape
a
second
de
bouteville
can
not
be
forgotten
very
and
so
men
turn
no
they
become
and
he
has
fled
then
you
say
yes
and
as
fast
as
his
horse
could
possibly
carry
in
what
direction
in
the
direction
of
the
well
and
after
that
afterwards
as
i
have
had
the
honor
of
telling
your
majesty
two
men
on
foot
arrived
who
carried
de
guiche
back
with
what
proof
have
you
that
these
men
arrived
after
the
combat
a
very
evident
proof
sire
at
the
moment
the
encounter
took
place
the
rain
had
just
ceased
the
ground
had
not
had
time
to
imbibe
the
moisture
and
was
consequently
soaked
the
footsteps
sank
in
the
ground
but
while
de
guiche
was
lying
there
in
a
fainting
condition
the
ground
became
firm
again
and
the
footsteps
made
a
less
sensible
louis
clapped
his
hands
together
in
sign
of
admiration
monsieur
d
artagnan
he
said
you
are
positively
the
cleverest
man
in
my
the
identical
thing
de
richelieu
thought
and
de
mazarin
said
and
now
it
remains
for
us
to
see
if
your
sagacity
is
at
oh
sire
a
man
may
be
mistaken
est
said
the
musketeer
philosophically
in
that
case
you
are
not
human
monsieur
d
artagnan
for
i
believe
you
are
never
your
majesty
said
that
we
were
going
to
see
whether
such
was
the
case
or
in
what
way
may
i
venture
to
ask
i
have
sent
for
de
manicamp
and
de
manicamp
is
and
de
manicamp
knows
the
secret
de
guiche
has
no
secrets
from
de
d
artagnan
shook
his
head
no
one
was
present
at
the
combat
i
repeat
and
unless
de
manicamp
was
one
of
the
two
men
who
brought
him
back
hush
said
the
king
he
is
coming
remain
and
listen
very
good
and
at
the
very
same
moment
manicamp
and
appeared
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
chapter
xvii
the
encounter
the
king
signified
with
an
imperious
gesture
first
to
the
musketeer
then
to
on
your
lives
not
a
d
artagnan
withdrew
like
a
sentinel
to
a
corner
of
the
room
in
his
character
of
a
favorite
leaned
over
the
back
of
the
king
s
chair
manicamp
with
his
right
foot
properly
advanced
a
smile
upon
his
lips
and
his
white
and
hands
gracefully
disposed
advanced
to
make
his
reverence
to
the
king
who
returned
the
salutation
by
a
bow
good
evening
de
manicamp
he
said
your
majesty
did
me
the
honor
to
send
for
me
said
manicamp
yes
in
order
to
learn
from
you
all
the
details
of
the
unfortunate
accident
which
has
befallen
the
comte
de
oh
sire
it
is
grievous
you
were
there
not
precisely
but
you
arrived
on
the
scene
of
the
accident
a
few
minutes
after
it
took
place
sire
about
half
an
hour
and
where
did
the
accident
happen
i
believe
sire
the
place
is
called
the
du
oh
the
rendezvous
of
the
the
very
spot
good
give
me
all
the
details
you
are
acquainted
with
respecting
this
unhappy
affair
monsieur
de
perhaps
your
majesty
has
already
been
informed
of
them
and
i
fear
to
fatigue
you
with
useless
no
do
not
be
afraid
of
manicamp
looked
round
him
he
saw
only
d
artagnan
leaning
with
his
back
against
the
wainscot
d
artagnan
calm
kind
and
as
usual
and
whom
he
had
accompanied
and
who
still
leaned
over
the
king
s
armchair
with
an
expression
of
countenance
equally
full
of
good
feeling
he
determined
therefore
to
speak
out
your
majesty
is
perfectly
aware
he
said
that
accidents
are
very
frequent
in
in
hunting
do
you
say
i
mean
sire
when
an
animal
is
brought
to
ah
ah
said
the
king
it
was
when
the
animal
was
brought
to
bay
then
that
the
accident
happened
alas
sire
unhappily
it
the
king
paused
for
a
moment
before
he
said
what
animal
was
being
hunted
a
wild
boar
and
what
could
possibly
have
possessed
de
guiche
to
go
to
a
wild
by
himself
that
is
but
a
clownish
idea
of
sport
only
fit
for
that
class
of
people
who
unlike
the
marechal
de
gramont
have
no
dogs
and
huntsmen
to
hunt
as
gentlemen
should
manicamp
shrugged
his
shoulders
youth
is
very
rash
he
said
sententiously
well
go
on
said
the
king
at
all
events
continued
manicamp
not
venturing
to
be
too
precipitate
and
hasty
and
letting
his
words
fall
very
slowly
one
by
one
at
all
events
sire
poor
de
guiche
went
hunting
all
quite
alone
indeed
what
a
sportsman
and
is
not
de
guiche
aware
that
the
wild
boar
always
stands
at
bay
that
is
the
very
thing
that
really
happened
he
had
some
idea
then
of
the
beast
being
there
yes
sire
some
peasants
had
seen
it
among
their
and
what
kind
of
animal
was
it
a
short
thick
you
may
as
well
tell
me
monsieur
that
de
guiche
had
some
idea
of
committing
suicide
for
i
have
seen
him
hunt
and
he
is
an
active
and
vigorous
hunter
whenever
he
fires
at
an
animal
brought
to
bay
and
held
in
check
by
the
dogs
he
takes
every
possible
precaution
and
yet
he
fires
with
a
carbine
and
on
this
occasion
he
seems
to
have
faced
the
boar
with
pistols
manicamp
started
a
costly
pair
of
pistols
excellent
weapons
to
fight
a
duel
with
a
man
and
not
a
wild
boar
what
an
absurdity
there
are
some
things
sire
which
are
difficult
of
you
are
quite
right
and
the
event
which
we
are
now
discussing
is
certainly
one
of
them
go
during
the
recital
who
probably
would
have
made
a
sign
to
manicamp
to
be
careful
what
he
was
about
found
that
the
king
s
glance
was
constantly
fixed
upon
himself
so
that
it
was
utterly
impossible
to
communicate
with
manicamp
in
any
way
as
for
d
artagnan
the
statue
of
silence
at
athens
was
far
more
noisy
and
far
more
expressive
than
he
manicamp
therefore
was
obliged
to
continue
in
the
same
way
he
had
begun
and
so
contrived
to
get
more
and
more
entangled
in
his
explanation
sire
he
said
this
is
probably
how
the
affair
happened
guiche
was
waiting
to
receive
the
boar
as
it
rushed
towards
on
foot
or
on
horseback
inquired
the
king
on
horseback
he
fired
upon
the
brute
and
missed
his
aim
and
then
it
dashed
upon
and
the
horse
was
ah
your
majesty
knows
that
i
have
been
told
that
a
horse
has
been
found
lying
dead
in
the
of
the
and
i
presume
it
was
de
guiche
s
perfectly
true
sire
it
was
well
so
much
for
the
horse
and
now
for
de
guiche
de
guiche
once
down
was
attacked
and
worried
by
the
wild
boar
and
wounded
in
the
hand
and
in
the
it
is
a
horrible
accident
but
it
must
be
admitted
it
was
de
guiche
s
own
fault
how
could
he
possibly
have
gone
to
hunt
such
an
animal
merely
armed
with
pistols
he
must
have
forgotten
the
fable
of
adonis
manicamp
rubbed
his
ear
in
seeming
perplexity
very
true
he
said
it
was
very
can
you
explain
it
monsieur
manicamp
sire
what
is
written
is
written
ah
you
are
a
manicamp
looked
very
uncomfortable
and
ill
at
ease
i
am
angry
with
you
monsieur
manicamp
continued
the
king
with
me
sire
yes
how
was
it
that
you
who
are
de
guiche
s
intimate
friend
and
who
know
that
he
is
subject
to
such
acts
of
folly
did
not
stop
him
in
time
manicamp
no
longer
knew
what
to
do
the
tone
in
which
the
king
spoke
was
anything
but
that
of
a
credulous
man
on
the
other
hand
it
did
not
indicate
any
particular
severity
nor
did
he
seem
to
care
very
much
about
the
there
was
more
of
raillery
in
it
than
menace
and
you
say
then
continued
the
king
that
it
was
positively
de
guiche
s
horse
that
was
found
dead
quite
positive
did
that
astonish
you
no
sire
for
your
majesty
will
remember
that
at
the
last
hunt
de
had
a
horse
killed
under
him
and
in
the
same
yes
but
that
one
was
ripped
of
course
had
guiche
s
horse
been
ripped
open
like
de
s
horse
i
should
not
have
been
manicamp
opened
his
eyes
very
wide
am
i
mistaken
resumed
the
king
was
it
not
in
the
frontal
bone
that
de
guiche
s
horse
was
struck
you
must
admit
monsieur
de
manicamp
that
that
is
a
very
singular
place
for
a
wild
boar
to
you
are
aware
sire
that
the
horse
is
a
very
intelligent
animal
and
he
doubtless
endeavoured
to
defend
but
a
horse
defends
himself
with
his
heels
and
not
with
his
in
that
case
the
terrified
horse
may
have
slipped
or
fallen
down
said
manicamp
and
the
boar
you
understand
sire
the
boar
oh
i
understand
that
perfectly
as
far
as
the
horse
is
concerned
but
how
about
his
rider
well
that
too
is
simple
enough
the
boar
left
the
horse
and
attacked
the
rider
and
as
i
have
already
had
the
honor
of
informing
your
majesty
shattered
de
guiche
s
hand
at
the
very
moment
he
was
about
to
discharge
his
second
pistol
at
him
and
then
with
a
gouge
of
his
tusk
made
that
terrible
hole
in
his
nothing
is
more
likely
really
monsieur
de
manicamp
you
are
wrong
in
placing
so
little
confidence
in
your
own
eloquence
and
you
can
tell
a
story
most
your
majesty
is
exceedingly
kind
said
manicamp
saluting
him
in
the
most
embarrassed
manner
from
this
day
henceforth
i
will
prohibit
any
gentleman
attached
to
my
court
going
out
to
a
similar
encounter
really
one
might
just
as
well
permit
manicamp
started
and
moved
as
if
he
were
about
to
withdraw
is
your
majesty
satisfied
delighted
but
do
not
withdraw
yet
monsieur
de
manicamp
said
louis
i
have
something
to
say
to
well
well
thought
d
artagnan
there
is
another
who
is
not
up
to
the
mark
and
he
uttered
a
sigh
which
might
signify
oh
the
men
of
stamp
where
are
they
at
this
moment
an
usher
lifted
up
the
curtain
before
the
door
and
announced
the
king
s
physician
ah
exclaimed
louis
here
comes
monsieur
valot
who
has
just
been
to
see
de
guiche
we
shall
now
hear
news
of
the
man
maltreated
by
the
manicamp
felt
more
uncomfortable
than
ever
in
this
way
at
least
added
the
king
our
conscience
will
be
quite
and
he
looked
at
d
artagnan
who
did
not
seem
in
the
slightest
degree
discomposed
chapter
xviii
the
physician
valot
entered
the
position
of
the
different
persons
present
was
precisely
the
same
the
king
was
seated
leaning
over
the
back
of
his
armchair
d
artagnan
with
his
back
against
the
wall
and
manicamp
still
standing
well
valot
said
the
king
did
you
obey
my
directions
with
the
greatest
alacrity
you
went
to
the
doctor
s
house
in
fontainebleau
yes
and
you
found
de
guiche
there
i
did
what
state
was
he
in
speak
in
a
very
sad
state
indeed
the
wild
boar
did
not
quite
devour
him
however
devour
whom
de
what
wild
boar
the
boar
that
wounded
m
de
guiche
wounded
by
a
boar
so
it
is
said
at
by
a
poacher
rather
or
by
a
jealous
husband
or
an
lover
who
in
order
to
be
revenged
fired
upon
what
is
it
that
you
say
monsieur
valot
were
not
de
guiche
s
wounds
produced
by
defending
himself
against
a
wild
boar
m
de
guiche
s
wounds
are
the
result
of
a
that
broke
his
and
the
little
finger
of
the
right
hand
and
afterwards
buried
itself
in
the
intercostal
muscles
of
the
a
bullet
are
you
sure
monsieur
de
guiche
was
wounded
by
a
exclaimed
the
king
pretending
to
look
much
surprised
indeed
i
am
sire
so
sure
in
fact
that
here
it
and
he
presented
to
the
king
a
bullet
which
the
king
looked
at
but
did
not
touch
did
he
have
that
in
his
chest
poor
fellow
he
asked
not
precisely
the
ball
did
not
penetrate
but
was
flattened
as
you
see
either
upon
the
trigger
of
the
pistol
or
upon
the
right
side
of
the
good
heavens
said
the
king
seriously
you
said
nothing
to
me
about
this
monsieur
de
sire
what
does
all
this
mean
then
this
invention
about
hunting
a
wild
boar
at
nightfall
come
speak
sire
it
seems
then
that
you
are
right
said
the
king
turning
round
towards
his
captain
of
musketeers
and
that
a
duel
actually
took
the
king
possessed
to
a
greater
extent
than
any
one
else
the
faculty
enjoyed
by
the
great
in
power
or
position
of
compromising
and
dividing
those
beneath
him
manicamp
darted
a
look
full
of
reproaches
at
the
musketeer
d
artagnan
understood
the
look
at
once
and
not
wishing
to
remain
beneath
the
weight
of
such
an
accusation
advanced
a
step
forward
and
said
sire
your
majesty
commanded
me
to
go
and
explore
the
place
where
the
meet
in
the
and
to
report
to
you
according
to
my
own
ideas
what
had
taken
place
there
i
submitted
my
observations
to
you
but
without
denouncing
any
one
it
was
your
majesty
yourself
who
was
the
first
to
name
the
comte
de
well
monsieur
well
said
the
king
haughtily
you
have
done
your
duty
and
i
am
satisfied
with
you
but
you
monsieur
de
manicamp
have
failed
in
yours
for
you
have
told
me
a
a
falsehood
sire
the
expression
is
a
hard
find
a
more
accurate
sire
i
will
not
attempt
to
do
so
i
have
already
been
unfortunate
enough
to
displease
your
majesty
and
it
will
in
every
respect
be
far
better
for
me
to
accept
most
humbly
any
reproaches
you
may
think
proper
to
address
to
you
are
right
monsieur
whoever
conceals
the
truth
from
me
risks
my
sometimes
sire
one
is
ignorant
of
the
no
further
falsehood
monsieur
or
i
double
the
manicamp
bowed
and
turned
pale
d
artagnan
again
made
another
step
forward
determined
to
interfere
if
the
still
increasing
anger
of
the
king
attained
certain
limits
you
see
monsieur
continued
the
king
that
it
is
useless
to
deny
the
thing
any
longer
de
guiche
has
fought
a
i
do
not
deny
it
sire
and
it
would
have
been
truly
generous
on
your
majesty
s
part
not
to
have
forced
me
to
tell
a
forced
who
forced
you
sire
de
guiche
is
my
friend
your
majesty
has
forbidden
duels
under
pain
of
death
a
falsehood
might
save
my
friend
s
life
and
i
told
good
murmured
d
artagnan
an
excellent
fellow
upon
my
instead
of
telling
a
falsehood
monsieur
you
should
have
prevented
him
from
fighting
said
the
king
oh
sire
your
majesty
who
is
the
most
accomplished
gentleman
in
france
knows
quite
as
well
as
any
of
us
other
gentlemen
that
we
have
never
considered
de
bouteville
dishonored
for
having
suffered
death
on
the
place
de
greve
that
which
does
in
truth
dishonor
a
man
is
to
avoid
meeting
his
enemy
not
to
avoid
meeting
his
executioner
well
monsieur
that
may
be
so
said
louis
xiv
i
am
desirous
of
suggesting
a
means
of
your
repairing
if
it
be
a
means
of
which
a
gentleman
may
avail
himself
i
shall
most
eagerly
seize
the
the
name
of
de
guiche
s
adversary
oh
oh
murmured
d
artagnan
are
we
going
to
take
louis
xiii
as
a
model
sire
said
manicamp
with
an
accent
of
reproach
you
will
not
name
him
then
said
the
king
sire
i
do
not
know
bravo
murmured
d
artagnan
monsieur
de
manicamp
hand
your
sword
to
the
manicamp
bowed
very
gracefully
unbuckled
his
sword
smiling
as
he
did
so
and
handed
it
for
the
musketeer
to
take
but
advanced
hurriedly
between
him
and
d
artagnan
sire
he
said
will
your
majesty
permit
me
to
say
a
word
do
so
said
the
king
delighted
perhaps
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
for
some
one
to
step
between
him
and
the
wrath
he
felt
he
had
carried
him
too
far
manicamp
you
are
a
brave
man
and
the
king
will
appreciate
your
conduct
but
to
wish
to
serve
your
friends
too
well
is
to
destroy
them
manicamp
you
know
the
name
the
king
asks
you
for
it
is
perfectly
true
i
do
know
you
will
give
it
up
then
if
i
felt
i
ought
to
have
mentioned
it
i
should
have
already
done
then
i
will
tell
it
for
i
am
not
so
extremely
sensitive
on
such
points
of
honor
as
you
you
are
at
liberty
to
do
so
but
it
seems
to
me
however
oh
a
truce
to
magnanimity
i
will
not
permit
you
to
go
to
the
bastile
in
that
way
do
you
speak
or
i
manicamp
was
enough
and
perfectly
understood
that
he
had
done
quite
sufficient
to
produce
a
good
opinion
of
his
conduct
it
was
now
only
a
question
of
persevering
in
such
a
manner
as
to
regain
the
good
graces
of
the
king
speak
monsieur
he
said
to
i
have
on
my
own
behalf
done
all
that
my
conscience
told
me
to
do
and
it
must
have
been
very
importunate
he
added
turning
towards
the
king
since
its
mandates
led
me
to
disobey
your
majesty
s
commands
but
your
majesty
will
forgive
me
i
hope
when
you
learn
that
i
was
anxious
to
preserve
the
honor
of
a
of
a
lady
said
the
king
with
some
uneasiness
yes
a
lady
was
the
cause
of
this
duel
manicamp
bowed
if
the
position
of
the
lady
in
question
warrants
it
he
said
i
shall
not
complain
of
your
having
acted
with
so
much
circumspection
on
the
contrary
sire
everything
which
concerns
your
majesty
s
household
or
the
household
of
your
majesty
s
brother
is
of
importance
in
my
in
my
brother
s
household
repeated
louis
with
a
slight
hesitation
the
cause
of
the
duel
was
a
lady
belonging
to
my
brother
s
household
do
you
say
or
to
madame
ah
to
madame
s
yes
well
and
this
lady
is
one
of
the
maids
of
honor
of
her
royal
highness
madame
la
duchesse
d
for
whom
de
guiche
fought
do
you
say
yes
sire
and
this
time
i
tell
no
louis
seemed
restless
and
anxious
gentlemen
he
said
turning
towards
the
spectators
of
this
scene
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
retire
for
a
moment
i
wish
to
be
alone
with
de
manicamp
i
know
he
has
some
important
communication
to
make
for
his
own
justification
and
which
he
will
not
venture
before
witnesses
put
up
your
sword
de
manicamp
returned
his
sword
to
his
belt
the
fellow
decidedly
has
his
wits
about
him
murmured
the
musketeer
taking
by
the
arm
and
withdrawing
with
him
he
will
get
out
of
it
said
the
latter
in
d
artagnan
s
ear
and
with
honor
too
manicamp
cast
a
glance
of
recognition
at
and
the
captain
which
luckily
passed
unnoticed
by
the
king
come
come
said
d
artagnan
as
he
left
the
room
i
had
an
indifferent
opinion
of
the
new
generation
well
i
was
mistaken
after
all
there
is
some
good
in
them
i
valot
preceded
the
favorite
and
the
captain
leaving
the
king
and
manicamp
alone
in
the
cabinet
chapter
xix
wherein
d
artagnan
perceives
that
it
was
he
who
was
mistaken
and
manicamp
who
was
right
the
king
determined
to
be
satisfied
that
no
one
was
listening
went
himself
to
the
door
and
then
returned
precipitately
and
placed
himself
opposite
manicamp
and
now
we
are
alone
monsieur
de
manicamp
explain
with
the
greatest
frankness
sire
replied
the
young
man
and
in
the
first
place
pray
understand
added
the
king
that
there
is
nothing
to
which
i
personally
attach
a
greater
importance
than
the
honor
of
that
is
the
very
reason
sire
why
i
endeavored
to
study
your
delicacy
of
sentiment
and
yes
i
understand
it
all
now
you
say
that
it
was
one
of
the
maids
of
honor
of
my
who
was
the
subject
of
dispute
and
that
the
person
in
question
de
guiche
s
adversary
the
man
in
point
of
fact
whom
you
will
not
name
but
whom
de
will
name
yes
you
say
however
that
this
man
insulted
some
one
belonging
to
the
household
of
yes
sire
mademoiselle
de
la
ah
said
the
king
as
if
he
had
expected
the
name
and
yet
as
if
its
announcement
had
caused
him
a
sudden
pang
ah
it
was
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
who
was
i
do
not
say
precisely
that
she
was
insulted
but
at
all
events
i
merely
say
that
she
was
spoken
of
in
terms
far
enough
from
a
man
dares
to
speak
in
disrespectful
terms
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
yet
you
refuse
to
tell
me
the
name
of
the
insulter
sire
i
thought
it
was
quite
understood
that
your
majesty
had
abandoned
the
idea
of
making
me
denounce
perfectly
true
monsieur
returned
the
king
controlling
his
anger
besides
i
shall
know
in
good
time
the
name
of
this
man
whom
i
shall
feel
it
my
duty
to
manicamp
perceived
that
they
had
returned
to
the
question
again
as
for
the
king
he
saw
he
had
allowed
himself
to
be
hurried
away
a
little
too
far
and
therefore
continued
and
i
will
punish
him
not
because
there
is
any
question
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
although
i
esteem
her
very
highly
but
because
a
lady
was
the
object
of
the
quarrel
and
i
intend
that
ladies
shall
be
respected
at
my
court
and
that
quarrels
shall
be
put
a
stop
to
manicamp
bowed
and
now
monsieur
de
manicamp
continued
the
king
what
was
said
about
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
can
not
your
majesty
guess
i
your
majesty
can
imagine
the
character
of
the
jest
in
which
young
men
permit
themselves
to
they
very
probably
said
that
she
was
in
love
with
some
one
the
king
ventured
to
remark
probably
but
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
has
a
perfect
right
to
love
any
one
she
pleases
said
the
king
that
is
the
very
point
de
guiche
and
on
account
of
which
he
fought
do
you
mean
yes
sire
the
sole
and
only
the
king
colored
and
you
do
not
know
anything
more
then
in
what
respect
sire
in
the
very
interesting
respect
which
you
are
now
referring
what
does
your
majesty
wish
to
know
why
the
name
of
the
man
with
whom
la
valliere
is
in
love
and
whom
de
guiche
s
adversary
disputed
her
right
to
sire
i
know
nothing
i
have
heard
nothing
and
have
learnt
nothing
even
accidentally
but
de
guiche
is
a
fellow
and
if
momentarily
he
substituted
himself
in
the
place
or
stead
of
la
valliere
s
protector
it
was
because
that
protector
was
himself
of
too
exalted
a
position
to
undertake
her
these
words
were
more
than
transparent
they
made
the
king
blush
but
this
time
with
pleasure
he
struck
manicamp
gently
on
the
shoulder
well
well
monsieur
de
manicamp
you
are
not
only
a
ready
witty
fellow
but
a
brave
gentleman
besides
and
your
friend
de
guiche
is
a
paladin
quite
after
my
own
heart
you
will
express
that
to
him
from
your
majesty
forgives
me
then
and
i
am
free
the
king
smiled
and
held
out
his
hand
to
manicamp
which
he
took
and
kissed
respectfully
and
then
added
the
king
you
relate
stories
so
i
sire
you
told
me
in
the
most
admirable
manner
the
particulars
of
the
accident
which
happened
to
guiche
i
can
see
the
wild
boar
rushing
out
of
the
wood
i
can
see
the
horse
fall
down
fighting
with
his
head
and
the
boar
rush
from
the
horse
to
the
rider
you
do
not
simply
relate
a
story
well
you
positively
paint
its
sire
i
think
your
majesty
condescends
to
laugh
at
my
expense
said
manicamp
on
the
contrary
said
louis
seriously
i
have
so
little
intention
of
laughing
monsieur
de
manicamp
that
i
wish
you
to
relate
this
adventure
to
every
the
adventure
of
the
hunt
yes
in
the
same
manner
you
told
it
to
me
without
changing
a
single
word
understand
perfectly
and
you
will
relate
it
then
without
losing
a
very
well
and
now
summon
d
artagnan
i
hope
you
are
no
longer
afraid
of
oh
sire
from
the
very
moment
i
am
sure
of
your
majesty
s
kind
disposition
i
no
longer
fear
anything
call
him
then
said
the
king
manicamp
opened
the
door
and
said
gentlemen
the
king
wishes
you
to
d
artagnan
and
valot
entered
gentlemen
said
the
king
i
summoned
you
for
the
purposes
of
saying
that
monsieur
de
manicamp
s
explanation
has
entirely
satisfied
d
artagnan
glanced
at
valot
and
as
much
as
to
say
well
did
i
not
tell
you
so
the
king
led
manicamp
to
the
door
and
then
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
said
see
that
de
guiche
takes
good
care
of
himself
and
particularly
that
he
recovers
as
soon
as
possible
i
am
very
desirous
of
thanking
him
in
the
name
of
every
lady
but
let
him
take
special
care
that
he
does
not
begin
were
he
to
die
a
hundred
times
sire
he
would
begin
again
if
your
majesty
s
honor
were
in
any
way
called
in
this
remark
was
direct
enough
but
we
have
already
said
that
the
incense
of
flattery
was
very
pleasing
to
the
king
and
provided
he
received
it
he
was
not
very
particular
as
to
its
quality
very
well
very
well
he
said
as
he
dismissed
manicamp
i
will
see
de
guiche
myself
and
make
him
listen
to
and
as
manicamp
left
the
apartment
the
king
turned
round
towards
the
three
spectators
of
this
scene
and
said
tell
me
monsieur
d
artagnan
how
does
it
happen
that
your
sight
is
so
imperfect
you
whose
eyes
are
generally
so
very
my
sight
bad
sire
it
must
be
the
case
since
your
majesty
says
so
but
in
what
respect
may
i
ask
why
with
regard
to
what
occurred
in
the
ah
ah
certainly
you
pretended
to
have
seen
the
tracks
of
two
horses
to
have
detected
the
footprints
of
two
men
and
have
described
the
particulars
of
an
engagement
which
you
assert
took
place
nothing
of
the
sort
occurred
pure
illusion
on
your
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
exactly
the
same
thing
with
the
galloping
to
and
fro
of
the
horses
and
the
other
indications
of
a
struggle
it
was
the
struggle
of
de
guiche
against
the
wild
boar
and
absolutely
nothing
else
only
the
struggle
was
a
long
and
a
terrible
one
it
ah
ah
continued
d
artagnan
and
when
i
think
that
i
almost
believed
it
for
a
moment
but
then
you
told
it
with
such
i
admit
sire
that
i
must
have
been
very
said
d
artagnan
with
a
readiness
of
humor
which
delighted
the
king
you
do
admit
it
then
admit
it
sire
most
assuredly
i
so
now
that
you
see
the
thing
in
quite
a
different
light
from
that
in
which
i
saw
it
half
an
hour
and
to
what
then
do
you
attribute
this
difference
in
your
opinion
oh
a
very
simple
thing
sire
half
an
hour
ago
i
returned
from
where
i
had
nothing
to
light
me
but
a
stupid
stable
lantern
while
now
while
now
i
have
all
the
of
your
cabinet
and
more
than
that
your
majesty
s
own
eyes
which
illuminate
everything
like
the
blazing
sun
at
the
king
began
to
laugh
and
broke
out
into
convulsions
of
merriment
it
is
precisely
like
valot
said
d
artagnan
resuming
the
conversation
where
the
king
had
left
off
he
has
been
imagining
all
along
that
not
only
was
de
guiche
wounded
by
a
bullet
but
still
more
that
he
extracted
it
even
from
his
upon
my
word
said
valot
i
assure
you
now
did
you
not
believe
that
continued
d
artagnan
yes
said
valot
not
only
did
i
believe
it
but
at
this
very
moment
i
would
swear
well
my
dear
doctor
you
have
dreamt
i
have
dreamt
it
m
de
guiche
s
wound
a
mere
dream
the
bullet
a
dream
so
take
my
advice
and
prate
no
more
about
well
said
returned
the
king
m
d
artagnan
s
advice
is
sound
do
not
speak
of
your
dream
to
any
one
monsieur
valot
and
upon
the
word
of
a
gentleman
you
will
have
no
occasion
to
repent
it
good
evening
gentlemen
a
very
sad
affair
indeed
is
a
wild
a
very
serious
thing
indeed
repeated
d
artagnan
in
a
loud
voice
is
a
wild
and
he
repeated
it
in
every
room
through
which
he
passed
and
left
the
chateau
taking
valot
with
him
and
now
we
are
alone
said
the
king
to
what
is
the
name
of
de
guiche
s
adversary
looked
at
the
king
oh
do
not
hesitate
said
the
king
you
know
that
i
am
bound
beforehand
to
de
wardes
said
very
good
said
louis
xiv
and
then
retiring
to
his
own
room
added
to
himself
to
forgive
is
not
to
chapter
xx
showing
the
advantage
of
having
two
strings
to
one
s
bow
manicamp
quitted
the
king
s
apartment
delighted
at
having
succeeded
so
well
when
just
as
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
and
was
passing
a
doorway
he
felt
that
some
one
suddenly
pulled
him
by
the
sleeve
he
turned
round
and
recognized
montalais
who
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
passage
and
who
in
a
very
mysterious
manner
with
her
body
bent
forward
and
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
said
to
him
follow
me
monsieur
and
without
any
delay
if
you
where
to
mademoiselle
inquired
manicamp
in
the
first
place
a
true
knight
would
not
have
asked
such
a
question
but
would
have
followed
me
without
requiring
any
well
mademoiselle
i
am
quite
ready
to
conduct
myself
as
a
true
no
it
is
too
late
and
you
can
not
take
the
credit
of
it
we
are
going
to
madame
s
apartment
so
come
at
ah
ah
said
manicamp
lead
on
and
he
followed
montalais
who
ran
before
him
as
light
as
galatea
this
time
said
manicamp
as
he
followed
his
guide
i
do
not
think
that
stories
about
hunting
expeditions
would
be
acceptable
we
will
try
however
and
if
need
be
well
if
there
should
be
any
occasion
for
it
we
must
try
something
montalais
still
ran
on
how
fatiguing
it
is
thought
manicamp
to
have
need
of
one
s
head
and
legs
at
the
same
at
last
however
they
arrived
madame
had
just
finished
undressing
and
was
in
a
most
elegant
but
it
must
be
understood
that
she
had
changed
her
dress
before
she
had
any
idea
of
being
subjected
to
the
emotions
now
agitating
her
she
was
waiting
with
the
most
restless
impatience
and
montalais
and
manicamp
found
her
standing
near
the
door
at
the
sound
of
their
approaching
footsteps
madame
came
forward
to
meet
them
ah
she
said
at
last
here
is
manicamp
replied
montalais
manicamp
bowed
with
the
greatest
respect
madame
signed
to
montalais
to
withdraw
and
she
immediately
obeyed
madame
followed
her
with
her
eyes
in
silence
until
the
door
closed
behind
her
and
then
turning
towards
manicamp
said
what
is
the
matter
and
is
it
true
as
i
am
told
monsieur
de
manicamp
that
some
one
is
lying
wounded
in
the
chateau
yes
madame
unfortunately
so
monsieur
de
yes
monsieur
de
guiche
repeated
the
princess
i
had
in
fact
heard
it
rumored
but
not
confirmed
and
so
in
truth
it
is
monsieur
de
guiche
who
has
been
thus
unfortunate
m
de
guiche
himself
are
you
aware
de
manicamp
said
the
princess
hastily
that
the
king
has
the
strongest
antipathy
to
duels
perfectly
so
madame
but
a
duel
with
a
wild
beast
is
not
oh
you
will
not
insult
me
by
supposing
that
i
credit
the
absurd
fable
with
what
object
i
can
not
tell
respecting
de
guiche
having
been
wounded
by
a
wild
boar
no
no
monsieur
the
real
truth
is
known
and
in
addition
to
the
inconvenience
of
his
wound
de
guiche
runs
the
risk
of
losing
his
liberty
if
not
his
alas
madame
i
am
well
aware
of
that
but
what
is
to
be
done
you
have
seen
the
king
yes
what
did
you
say
to
him
i
told
him
how
de
guiche
went
to
the
chase
and
how
a
wild
boar
rushed
forth
out
of
the
how
de
guiche
fired
at
it
and
how
in
fact
the
furious
brute
dashed
at
de
guiche
killed
his
horse
and
grievously
wounded
and
the
king
believed
that
oh
you
surprise
me
monsieur
de
manicamp
you
surprise
me
very
and
madame
walked
up
and
down
the
room
casting
a
searching
look
from
time
to
time
at
manicamp
who
remained
motionless
and
impassible
in
the
same
place
at
last
she
stopped
and
yet
she
said
every
one
here
seems
unanimous
in
giving
another
cause
for
this
what
cause
madame
said
manicamp
may
i
be
permitted
without
indiscretion
to
ask
your
highness
you
ask
such
a
question
you
de
guiche
s
intimate
friend
his
confidant
indeed
oh
madame
his
intimate
friend
yes
confidant
no
de
guiche
is
a
man
who
can
keep
his
own
secrets
who
has
some
of
his
own
certainly
but
who
never
breathes
a
syllable
about
them
de
guiche
is
discretion
itself
very
well
then
those
secrets
which
de
guiche
keeps
so
scrupulously
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
informing
you
of
said
the
princess
almost
spitefully
for
the
king
may
possibly
question
you
a
second
time
and
if
on
the
second
occasion
you
were
to
repeat
the
same
story
to
him
he
possibly
might
not
be
very
well
satisfied
with
but
madame
i
think
your
highness
is
mistaken
with
regard
to
the
king
his
majesty
was
perfectly
satisfied
with
me
i
assure
in
that
case
permit
me
to
assure
you
monsieur
de
manicamp
it
only
proves
one
thing
which
is
that
his
majesty
is
very
easily
i
think
your
highness
is
mistaken
in
arriving
at
such
an
opinion
his
majesty
is
well
known
not
to
be
contented
except
with
very
good
and
do
you
suppose
that
he
will
thank
you
for
your
officious
falsehood
when
he
will
learn
that
de
guiche
had
on
behalf
of
his
friend
de
bragelonne
a
quarrel
which
ended
in
a
hostile
meeting
a
quarrel
on
de
bragelonne
s
account
said
manicamp
with
the
most
innocent
expression
in
the
world
what
does
your
royal
highness
do
me
the
honor
to
tell
me
what
is
there
astonishing
in
that
de
guiche
is
susceptible
irritable
and
easily
loses
his
on
the
contrary
madame
i
know
de
guiche
to
be
very
patient
and
never
susceptible
or
irritable
except
upon
very
good
but
is
not
friendship
a
just
ground
said
the
princess
oh
certainly
madame
and
particularly
for
a
heart
like
very
good
you
will
not
deny
i
suppose
that
de
bragelonne
is
de
guiche
s
good
friend
a
great
well
then
de
guiche
has
taken
de
bragelonne
s
part
and
as
de
bragelonne
was
absent
and
could
not
fight
he
fought
for
manicamp
began
to
smile
and
moved
his
head
and
shoulders
very
slightly
as
much
as
to
say
oh
if
you
will
positively
have
it
so
but
speak
at
all
events
said
the
princess
out
of
patience
speak
i
of
course
it
is
quite
clear
you
are
not
of
my
opinion
and
that
you
have
something
to
i
have
only
one
thing
to
say
name
it
that
i
do
not
understand
a
single
word
of
what
you
have
just
been
telling
what
you
do
not
understand
a
single
word
about
de
guiche
s
quarrel
with
de
wardes
exclaimed
the
princess
almost
out
of
temper
manicamp
remained
silent
a
quarrel
she
continued
which
arose
out
of
a
conversation
scandalous
in
its
tone
and
purport
and
more
or
less
well
founded
respecting
the
virtue
of
a
certain
ah
of
a
certain
lady
this
is
quite
another
thing
said
manicamp
you
begin
to
understand
do
you
not
your
highness
will
excuse
me
but
i
dare
not
you
dare
not
said
madame
exasperated
very
well
then
wait
one
moment
i
will
madame
madame
exclaimed
manicamp
as
if
in
great
dismay
be
careful
of
what
you
are
going
to
it
would
seem
monsieur
that
if
i
happened
to
be
a
man
you
would
challenge
me
notwithstanding
his
majesty
s
edicts
as
monsieur
de
guiche
challenged
de
wardes
and
that
too
on
account
of
the
virtue
of
mademoiselle
de
la
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
exclaimed
manicamp
starting
backwards
as
if
that
was
the
very
last
name
he
expected
to
hear
pronounced
what
makes
you
start
in
that
manner
monsieur
de
manicamp
said
madame
ironically
do
you
mean
to
say
you
would
be
impertinent
enough
to
suspect
that
young
lady
s
honor
madame
in
the
whole
course
of
this
affair
there
has
not
been
the
slightest
question
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
what
when
two
men
have
almost
blown
each
other
s
brains
out
on
a
woman
s
behalf
do
you
mean
to
say
she
has
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
affair
and
that
her
name
has
not
been
called
in
question
at
all
i
did
not
think
you
so
good
a
courtier
monsieur
de
pray
forgive
me
madame
said
the
young
man
but
we
are
very
far
from
understanding
one
another
you
do
me
the
honor
to
speak
one
language
while
i
am
speaking
altogether
i
beg
your
pardon
but
i
do
not
understand
your
forgive
me
then
but
i
fancied
i
understood
your
highness
to
remark
that
de
guiche
and
de
wardes
had
fought
on
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
account
on
account
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
i
think
you
said
repeated
manicamp
i
do
not
say
that
de
guiche
personally
took
an
interest
in
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
but
i
say
that
he
did
so
as
representing
or
acting
on
behalf
of
on
behalf
of
another
come
do
not
always
assume
such
a
bewildered
look
does
not
every
one
here
know
that
de
bragelonne
is
affianced
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
that
before
he
went
on
the
mission
with
which
the
king
intrusted
him
he
charged
his
friend
de
guiche
to
watch
over
that
interesting
young
lady
there
is
nothing
more
for
me
to
say
then
your
highness
is
of
everything
i
beg
you
to
understand
that
manicamp
began
to
laugh
which
almost
exasperated
the
princess
who
was
not
as
we
know
of
a
very
patient
disposition
madame
resumed
the
discreet
manicamp
saluting
the
princess
let
us
bury
this
affair
altogether
in
forgetfulness
for
it
will
probably
never
be
quite
cleared
oh
as
far
as
that
goes
there
is
nothing
more
to
do
and
the
information
is
complete
the
king
will
learn
that
de
guiche
has
taken
up
the
cause
of
this
little
adventuress
who
gives
herself
all
the
airs
of
a
grand
lady
he
will
learn
that
monsieur
de
bragelonne
having
nominated
his
friend
de
guiche
his
the
latter
immediately
fastened
as
he
was
required
to
do
upon
the
marquis
de
wardes
who
ventured
to
trench
upon
his
privileges
moreover
you
can
not
pretend
to
deny
monsieur
manicamp
you
who
know
everything
so
well
that
the
king
on
his
side
casts
a
longing
eye
upon
this
famous
treasure
and
that
he
will
bear
no
slight
grudge
against
de
guiche
for
constituting
himself
its
defender
are
you
sufficiently
well
informed
now
or
do
you
require
anything
further
if
so
speak
no
madame
there
is
nothing
more
i
wish
to
learn
however
for
you
ought
to
know
it
monsieur
de
manicamp
learn
that
his
majesty
s
indignation
will
be
followed
by
terrible
consequences
in
princes
of
a
similar
temperament
to
that
of
his
majesty
the
passion
which
jealousy
causes
sweeps
down
like
a
which
you
will
temper
i
exclaimed
the
princess
with
a
gesture
of
indescribable
irony
i
and
by
what
title
may
i
ask
because
you
detest
injustice
and
according
to
your
account
then
it
would
be
an
injustice
to
prevent
the
king
arranging
his
love
affairs
as
he
you
will
intercede
however
in
de
guiche
s
favor
you
are
mad
monsieur
said
the
princess
in
a
haughty
tone
of
voice
on
the
contrary
i
am
in
the
most
perfect
possession
of
my
senses
and
i
repeat
you
will
defend
de
guiche
before
the
why
should
i
because
the
cause
of
de
guiche
is
your
own
madame
said
manicamp
with
ardor
kindling
in
his
eyes
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
mean
madame
that
with
respect
to
the
defense
which
monsieur
de
guiche
undertook
in
de
bragelonne
s
absence
i
am
surprised
that
your
highness
has
not
detected
a
pretext
in
la
valliere
s
name
having
been
brought
a
pretext
but
a
pretext
for
what
repeated
the
princess
hesitatingly
for
manicamp
s
steady
look
had
just
revealed
something
of
the
truth
to
her
i
trust
madame
said
the
young
man
i
have
said
sufficient
to
induce
your
highness
not
to
overwhelm
before
his
majesty
my
poor
friend
de
guiche
against
whom
all
the
malevolence
of
a
party
bitterly
opposed
to
your
own
will
now
be
you
mean
on
the
contrary
i
suppose
that
all
those
who
have
no
great
affection
for
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
even
perhaps
a
few
of
those
who
have
some
regard
for
her
will
be
angry
with
the
comte
oh
madame
why
will
you
push
your
obstinacy
to
such
an
extent
and
refuse
to
open
your
ears
and
listen
to
the
counsel
of
one
whose
devotion
to
you
is
unbounded
must
i
expose
myself
to
the
risk
of
your
displeasure
am
i
really
to
be
called
upon
to
name
contrary
to
my
own
wish
the
person
who
was
the
real
cause
of
this
quarrel
the
person
said
madame
blushing
must
i
continued
manicamp
tell
you
how
poor
de
guiche
became
irritated
furious
exasperated
beyond
all
control
at
the
different
rumors
now
being
circulated
about
this
person
must
i
if
you
persist
in
this
willful
blindness
and
if
respect
should
continue
to
prevent
me
naming
her
must
i
i
repeat
recall
to
your
recollection
the
various
scenes
which
monsieur
had
with
the
duke
of
buckingham
and
the
insinuations
which
were
reported
respecting
the
duke
s
exile
must
i
remind
you
of
the
anxious
care
the
comte
always
took
in
his
efforts
to
please
to
watch
to
protect
that
person
for
whom
alone
he
lives
for
whom
alone
he
breathes
well
i
will
do
so
and
when
i
shall
have
made
you
recall
all
the
particulars
i
refer
to
you
will
perhaps
understand
how
it
happened
that
the
comte
having
lost
all
control
over
himself
and
having
been
for
some
time
past
almost
harassed
to
death
by
de
wardes
became
at
the
first
disrespectful
expression
which
the
latter
pronounced
respecting
the
person
in
question
inflamed
with
passion
and
panted
only
for
an
opportunity
of
avenging
the
the
princess
concealed
her
face
with
her
hands
monsieur
monsieur
she
exclaimed
do
you
know
what
you
are
saying
and
to
whom
you
are
speaking
and
so
madame
pursued
manicamp
as
if
he
had
not
heard
the
exclamations
of
the
princess
nothing
will
astonish
you
any
longer
neither
the
comte
s
ardor
in
seeking
the
quarrel
nor
his
wonderful
address
in
transferring
it
to
a
quarter
foreign
to
your
own
personal
interests
that
latter
circumstance
was
indeed
a
marvelous
instance
of
tact
and
perfect
coolness
and
if
the
person
in
whose
behalf
the
comte
so
fought
and
shed
his
blood
does
in
reality
owe
some
gratitude
to
the
poor
wounded
sufferer
it
is
not
on
account
of
the
blood
he
has
shed
or
the
agony
he
has
suffered
but
for
the
steps
he
has
taken
to
preserve
from
comment
or
reflection
an
honor
which
is
more
precious
to
him
than
his
oh
cried
madame
as
if
she
had
been
alone
is
it
possible
the
quarrel
was
on
my
account
manicamp
felt
he
could
now
breathe
for
a
moment
and
gallantly
had
he
won
the
right
to
do
so
madame
on
her
side
remained
for
some
time
plunged
in
a
painful
reverie
her
agitation
could
be
seen
by
her
quick
respiration
by
her
drooping
eyelids
by
the
frequency
with
which
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
but
in
her
coquetry
was
not
so
much
a
passive
quality
as
on
the
contrary
a
fire
which
sought
for
fuel
to
maintain
itself
finding
anywhere
and
everywhere
what
it
required
if
it
be
as
you
assert
she
said
the
comte
will
have
obliged
two
persons
at
the
same
time
for
monsieur
de
bragelonne
also
owes
a
deep
debt
of
gratitude
to
de
guiche
and
with
far
greater
reason
indeed
because
everywhere
and
on
every
occasion
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
will
be
regarded
as
having
been
defended
by
this
generous
manicamp
perceived
that
there
still
remained
some
lingering
doubt
in
the
princess
s
heart
a
truly
admirable
service
indeed
he
said
is
the
one
he
has
rendered
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
a
truly
admirable
service
to
de
bragelonne
the
duel
has
created
a
sensation
which
in
some
respects
casts
a
dishonorable
suspicion
upon
that
young
girl
a
sensation
indeed
which
will
embroil
her
with
the
vicomte
the
consequence
is
that
de
wardes
s
has
had
three
results
instead
of
one
it
destroys
at
the
same
time
the
honor
of
a
woman
the
happiness
of
a
man
and
perhaps
it
has
wounded
to
death
one
of
the
best
gentlemen
in
france
oh
madame
your
logic
is
cold
even
calculating
it
always
condemns
it
never
manicamp
s
concluding
words
scattered
to
the
winds
the
last
doubt
which
lingered
not
in
madame
s
heart
but
in
her
mind
she
was
no
longer
a
princess
full
of
scruples
nor
a
woman
with
her
suspicions
but
one
whose
heart
has
just
felt
the
mortal
chill
of
a
wound
wounded
to
death
she
murmured
in
a
faltering
voice
oh
monsieur
de
manicamp
did
you
not
say
wounded
to
death
manicamp
returned
no
other
answer
than
a
deep
sigh
and
so
you
said
that
the
comte
is
dangerously
wounded
continued
the
princess
yes
madame
one
of
his
hands
is
shattered
and
he
has
a
bullet
lodged
in
his
gracious
heavens
resumed
the
princess
with
a
feverish
excitement
this
is
horrible
monsieur
de
manicamp
a
hand
shattered
do
you
say
and
a
bullet
in
his
breast
and
that
coward
that
wretch
that
assassin
de
wardes
did
it
manicamp
seemed
overcome
by
a
violent
emotion
he
had
in
fact
displayed
no
little
energy
in
the
latter
part
of
his
speech
as
for
madame
she
entirely
threw
aside
all
regard
for
the
formal
observances
of
propriety
society
imposes
for
when
with
her
passion
spoke
in
accents
either
of
anger
or
sympathy
nothing
could
restrain
her
impulses
madame
approached
manicamp
who
had
subsided
in
a
chair
as
if
his
grief
were
a
sufficiently
powerful
excuse
for
his
infraction
of
the
laws
of
etiquette
monsieur
she
said
seizing
him
by
the
hand
be
frank
with
manicamp
looked
up
is
de
guiche
in
danger
of
death
doubly
so
madame
he
replied
in
the
first
place
on
account
of
the
hemorrhage
which
has
taken
place
an
artery
having
been
injured
in
the
hand
and
next
in
consequence
of
the
wound
in
his
breast
which
may
the
doctor
is
afraid
at
least
have
injured
some
vital
he
may
die
then
die
yes
madame
and
without
even
having
had
the
consolation
of
knowing
that
you
have
been
told
of
his
you
will
tell
i
yes
are
you
not
his
friend
i
oh
no
madame
i
will
only
tell
de
guiche
if
indeed
he
is
still
in
a
condition
to
hear
me
i
will
only
tell
him
what
i
have
seen
that
is
your
cruelty
to
oh
monsieur
you
will
not
be
guilty
of
such
barbarity
indeed
madame
i
shall
speak
the
truth
for
nature
is
very
energetic
in
a
man
of
his
age
the
physicians
are
clever
men
and
if
by
chance
the
poor
comte
should
survive
his
wound
i
should
not
wish
him
to
die
of
a
wound
of
the
heart
after
surviving
one
of
the
manicamp
rose
and
with
an
expression
of
profoundest
respect
seemed
to
be
desirous
of
taking
leave
at
least
monsieur
said
madame
stopping
him
with
almost
a
suppliant
air
you
will
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
in
what
state
your
wounded
friend
is
and
who
is
the
physician
who
attends
him
as
regards
the
state
he
is
in
madame
he
is
seriously
ill
his
physician
is
valot
his
majesty
s
private
medical
attendant
valot
is
moreover
assisted
by
a
professional
friend
to
whose
house
de
guiche
has
been
what
he
is
not
in
the
chateau
said
madame
alas
madame
the
poor
fellow
was
so
ill
that
he
could
not
even
be
conveyed
give
me
the
address
monsieur
said
the
princess
hurriedly
i
will
send
to
inquire
after
rue
du
feurre
a
house
with
white
outside
blinds
the
doctor
s
name
is
on
the
you
are
returning
to
your
wounded
friend
monsieur
de
manicamp
yes
you
will
be
able
then
to
do
me
a
i
am
at
your
highness
s
do
what
you
intended
to
do
return
to
de
guiche
send
away
all
those
whom
you
may
find
there
and
have
the
kindness
yourself
to
go
away
madame
let
us
waste
no
time
in
useless
explanations
accept
the
fact
as
i
present
it
to
you
see
nothing
in
it
beyond
what
is
really
there
and
ask
nothing
further
than
what
i
tell
you
i
am
going
to
send
one
of
my
ladies
perhaps
two
because
it
is
now
getting
late
i
do
not
wish
them
to
see
you
or
rather
i
do
not
wish
you
to
see
them
these
are
scruples
you
can
understand
you
particularly
monsieur
de
manicamp
who
seem
capable
of
divining
so
oh
madame
perfectly
i
can
even
do
better
still
i
will
precede
or
rather
walk
in
advance
of
your
attendants
it
will
at
the
same
time
be
the
means
of
showing
them
the
way
more
accurately
and
of
protecting
them
if
occasion
arises
though
there
is
no
probability
of
their
needing
and
by
this
means
then
they
would
be
sure
of
entering
without
difficulty
would
they
not
certainly
madame
for
as
i
should
be
the
first
to
pass
i
thus
remove
any
difficulties
that
might
chance
to
be
in
the
very
well
go
go
monsieur
de
manicamp
and
wait
at
the
bottom
of
the
i
go
at
once
manicamp
paused
when
you
hear
the
footsteps
of
two
women
descending
the
stairs
go
out
and
without
once
turning
round
take
the
road
which
leads
to
where
the
poor
count
is
but
if
by
any
mischance
two
other
persons
were
to
descend
and
i
were
to
be
mistaken
you
will
hear
one
of
the
two
clap
her
hands
together
softly
manicamp
turned
round
bowed
once
more
and
left
the
room
his
heart
overflowing
with
joy
in
fact
he
knew
very
well
that
the
presence
of
madame
herself
would
be
the
best
balm
to
apply
to
his
friend
s
wounds
a
quarter
of
an
hour
had
hardly
elapsed
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
door
opened
softly
and
closed
with
like
precaution
he
listened
to
the
light
footfalls
gliding
down
the
staircase
and
then
heard
the
signal
agreed
upon
he
immediately
went
out
and
faithful
to
his
promise
bent
his
way
without
once
turning
his
head
through
the
streets
of
fontainebleau
towards
the
doctor
s
dwelling
chapter

two
women
their
figures
completely
concealed
by
their
mantles
and
whose
masks
effectually
hid
the
upper
portion
of
their
faces
timidly
followed
manicamp
s
steps
on
the
first
floor
behind
curtains
of
red
damask
the
soft
light
of
a
lamp
placed
upon
a
low
table
faintly
illumined
the

at
the

on

supported
by
spiral

around

which
deadened

de

his

were
gathering
his
long
black
hair
scattered
over
the
pillow
set
off
the
young
man
s
hollow
temples
it
was
easy
to
see
that
fever
was
the
chief
tenant
of
the
chamber
de
guiche
was
dreaming
his
wandering
mind
was
pursuing
through
gloom
and
mystery
one
of
those
wild
creations
delirium
engenders
two
or
three
drops
of
blood
still
liquid
stained
the
floor
manicamp
hurriedly
ran
up
the
stairs
but
paused
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
looked
into
the
room
and
seeing
that
everything
was
perfectly
quiet
he
advanced
towards
the
foot
of
the
large
leathern
armchair
a
specimen
of
furniture
of
the
reign
of
henry
and
seeing
that
the
nurse
as
a
matter
of
course
had
dropped
off
to
sleep
he
awoke
her
and
begged
her
to
pass
into
the
adjoining
room
then
standing
by
the
side
of
the
bed
he
remained
for
a
moment
deliberating
whether
it
would
be
better
to
awaken
guiche
in
order
to
acquaint
him
with
the
good
news
but
as
he
began
to
hear
behind
the
door
the
rustling
of
silk
dresses
and
the
hurried
breathing
of
his
two
companions
and
as
he
already
saw
that
the
curtain
screening
the
doorway
seemed
on
the
point
of
being
impatiently
drawn
aside
he
passed
round
the
bed
and
followed
the
nurse
into
the
next
room
as
soon
as
he
had
disappeared
the
curtain
was
raised
and
his
two
female
companions
entered
the
room
he
had
just
left
the
one
who
entered
first
made
a
gesture
to
her
companion
which
riveted
her
to
the
spot
where
she
stood
close
to
the
door
and
then
resolutely
advanced
towards
the
bed
drew
back
the
curtains
along
the
iron
rod
and
threw
them
in
thick
folds
behind
the
head
of
the
bed
she
gazed
upon
the
comte
s
pallid
face
remarked
his
right
hand
enveloped
in
linen
whose
dazzling
whiteness
was
emphasized
by
the
counterpane
patterned
with
dark
leaves
thrown
across
the
couch
she
shuddered
as
she
saw
a
stain
of
blood
growing
larger
and
larger
upon
the
bandages
the
young
man
s
breast
was
uncovered
as
though
for
the
cool
night
air
to
assist
his
respiration
a
narrow
bandage
fastened
the
dressings
of
the
wound
around
which
a
purplish
circle
of
extravasated
blood
was
gradually
increasing
in
size
a
deep
sigh
broke
from
her
lips
she
leaned
against
one
of
the
columns
of
the
bed
and
gazed
through
the
apertures
in
her
mask
upon
the
harrowing
spectacle
before
her
a
hoarse
harsh
groan
passed
like
a
through
the
comte
s
clenched
teeth
the
masked
lady
seized
his
left
hand
which
scorched
like
burning
coals
but
at
the
very
moment
she
placed
her
icy
hand
upon
it
the
action
of
the
cold
was
such
that
de
guiche
opened
his
eyes
and
by
a
look
in
which
revived
intelligence
was
dawning
seemed
as
though
struggling
back
again
into
existence
the
first
thing
upon
which
he
fixed
his
gaze
was
this
phantom
standing
erect
by
his
bedside
at
that
sight
his
eyes
became
dilated
but
without
any
appearance
of
consciousness
in
them
the
lady
thereupon
made
a
sign
to
her
companion
who
had
remained
at
the
door
and
in
all
probability
the
latter
had
already
received
her
lesson
for
in
a
clear
tone
of
voice
and
without
any
hesitation
whatever
she
pronounced
these
words
monsieur
le
comte
her
royal
highness
madame
is
desirous
of
knowing
how
you
are
able
to
bear
your
wound
and
to
express
to
you
by
my
lips
her
great
regret
at
seeing
you
as
she
pronounced
the
word
madame
guiche
started
he
had
not
as
yet
remarked
the
person
to
whom
the
voice
belonged
and
he
naturally
turned
towards
the
direction
whence
it
preceded
but
as
he
felt
the
cold
hand
still
resting
on
his
own
he
again
turned
towards
the
motionless
figure
beside
him
was
it
you
who
spoke
madame
he
asked
in
a
weak
voice
or
is
there
another
person
in
beside
you
in
the
room
yes
replied
the
figure
in
an
almost
unintelligible
voice
as
she
bent
down
her
head
well
said
the
wounded
man
with
a
great
effort
i
thank
you
tell
madame
that
i
no
longer
regret
to
die
since
she
has
remembered
at
the
words
to
die
pronounced
by
one
whose
life
seemed
to
hang
on
a
thread
the
masked
lady
could
not
restrain
her
tears
which
flowed
under
the
mask
and
appeared
upon
her
cheeks
just
where
the
mask
left
her
face
bare
if
de
guiche
had
been
in
fuller
possession
of
his
senses
he
would
have
seen
her
tears
roll
like
glistening
pearls
and
fall
upon
his
bed
the
lady
forgetting
that
she
wore
her
mask
raised
her
hand
as
though
to
wipe
her
eyes
and
meeting
the
rough
velvet
she
tore
away
her
mask
in
anger
and
threw
it
on
the
floor
at
the
unexpected
apparition
before
him
which
seemed
to
issue
from
a
cloud
de
guiche
uttered
a
cry
and
stretched
his
arms
towards
her
but
every
word
perished
on
his
lips
and
his
strength
seemed
utterly
abandoning
him
his
right
hand
which
had
followed
his
first
impulse
without
calculating
the
amount
of
strength
he
had
left
fell
back
again
upon
the
bed
and
immediately
afterwards
the
white
linen
was
stained
with
a
larger
spot
than
before
in
the
meantime
the
young
man
s
eyes
became
dim
and
closed
as
if
he
were
already
struggling
with
the
messenger
of
death
and
then
after
a
few
involuntary
movements
his
head
fell
back
motionless
on
his
pillow
his
face
grew
livid
the
lady
was
frightened
but
on
this
occasion
contrary
to
what
is
usually
the
case
fear
attracted
she
leaned
over
the
young
man
gazed
earnestly
fixedly
at
his
pale
cold
face
which
she
almost
touched
then
imprinted
a
rapid
kiss
upon
de
guiche
s
left
hand
who
trembling
as
if
an
electric
shock
had
passed
through
him
awoke
a
second
time
opened
his
large
eyes
incapable
of
recognition
and
again
fell
into
a
state
of
complete
insensibility
come
she
said
to
her
companion
we
must
not
remain
here
any
longer
i
shall
be
committing
some
folly
or
madame
madame
your
highness
is
forgetting
your
mask
said
her
vigilant
companion
pick
it
up
replied
her
mistress
as
she
tottered
almost
senseless
towards
the
staircase
and
as
the
outer
door
had
been
left
only
the
two
women
light
as
birds
passed
through
it
and
with
hurried
steps
returned
to
the
palace
one
of
them
ascended
towards
madame
s
apartments
where
she
disappeared
the
other
entered
the
rooms
belonging
to
the
maids
of
honor
namely
on
the
and
having
reached
her
own
room
she
sat
down
before
a
table
and
without
giving
herself
time
even
to
breathe
wrote
the
following
letter
this
evening
madame
has
been
to
see
de
guiche
everything
is
going
well
on
this
side
see
that
your
news
is
equally
exemplary
and
do
not
forget
to
burn
this
she
folded
the
letter
and
leaving
her
room
with
every
possible
precaution
crossed
a
corridor
which
led
to
the
apartments
appropriated
to
the
gentlemen
attached
to
monsieur
s
service
she
stopped
before
a
door
under
which
having
previously
knocked
twice
in
a
short
quick
manner
she
thrust
the
paper
and
fled
then
returning
to
her
own
room
she
removed
every
trace
of
her
having
gone
out
and
also
of
having
written
the
letter
amid
the
investigations
she
was
so
diligently
pursuing
she
perceived
on
the
table
the
mask
which
belonged
to
madame
and
which
according
to
her
mistress
s
directions
she
had
brought
back
but
had
forgotten
to
restore
to
her
oh
oh
she
said
i
must
not
forget
to
do
what
i
have
forgotten
and
she
took
hold
of
the
velvet
mask
by
that
part
which
covered
the
cheeks
and
feeling
that
her
thumb
was
wet
looked
at
it
it
was
not
only
wet
but
reddened
the
mask
had
fallen
upon
one
of
the
spots
of
blood
which
we
have
already
said
stained
the
floor
and
from
that
black
velvet
outside
which
had
accidentally
come
into
contact
with
it
the
blood
had
passed
through
to
the
inside
and
stained
the
white
cambric
lining
oh
oh
said
montalais
for
doubtless
our
readers
have
already
recognized
her
by
these
various
maneuvers
i
shall
not
give
back
this
mask
it
is
far
too
precious
and
rising
from
her
seat
she
ran
towards
a
box
made
of
maple
wood
which
inclosed
different
articles
of
toilette
and
perfumery
no
not
here
she
said
such
a
treasure
must
not
be
abandoned
to
the
slightest
chance
of
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
and
with
a
smile
that
was
peculiarly
her
own
she
added
beautiful
mask
stained
with
the
blood
of
that
brave
knight
you
shall
go
and
join
that
collection
of
wonders
la
valliere
s
and
raoul
s
letters
that
loving
collection
indeed
which
will
some
day
or
other
form
part
of
the
history
of
france
of
european
royalty
you
shall
be
placed
under
malicorne
s
care
said
the
laughing
girl
as
she
began
to
undress
herself
under
the
protection
of
that
worthy
malicorne
she
said
blowing
out
the
taper
who
thinks
he
was
born
only
to
become
the
chief
usher
of
monsieur
s
apartments
and
whom
i
will
make
keeper
of
the
records
and
historiographer
of
the
house
of
bourbon
and
of
the
first
houses
in
the
kingdom
let
him
grumble
now
that
discontented
malicorne

added
as
she
drew
the
curtains
and
fell
asleep
chapter
xxii
the
journey
the
next
day
being
agreed
upon
for
the
departure
the
king
at
eleven
o
clock
precisely
descended
the
grand
staircase
with
the
two
queens
and
madame
in
order
to
enter
his
carriage
drawn
by
six
horses
that
were
pawing
the
ground
in
impatience
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
the
whole
court
awaited
the
royal
appearance
in
the
crescent
in
their
travelling
costumes
the
large
number
of
saddled
horses
and
carriages
of
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
court
surrounded
by
their
attendants
servants
and
pages
formed
a
spectacle
whose
brilliancy
could
scarcely
be
equalled
the
king
entered
his
carriage
with
the
two
queens
madame
was
in
the
same
one
with
monsieur
the
maids
of
honor
followed
their
example
and
took
their
seats
two
by
two
in
the
carriages
destined
for
them
the
weather
was
exceedingly
warm
a
light
breeze
which
early
in
the
morning
all
had
thought
would
have
proved
sufficient
to
cool
the
air
soon
became
fiercely
heated
by
the
rays
of
the
sun
although
it
was
hidden
behind
the
clouds
and
filtered
through
the
heated
vapor
which
rose
from
the
ground
like
a
scorching
wind
bearing
particles
of
fine
dust
against
the
faces
of
the
travelers
madame
was
the
first
to
complain
of
the
heat
monsieur
s
only
reply
was
to
throw
himself
back
in
the
carriage
as
though
about
to
faint
and
to
inundate
himself
with
scents
and
perfumes
uttering
the
deepest
sighs
all
the
while
whereupon
madame
said
to
him
with
her
most
amiable
expression
really
monsieur
i
fancied
that
you
would
have
been
polite
enough
on
account
of
the
terrible
heat
to
have
left
me
my
carriage
to
myself
and
to
have
performed
the
journey
yourself
on
ride
on
horseback
cried
the
prince
with
an
accent
of
dismay
which
showed
how
little
idea
he
had
of
adopting
this
unnatural
advice
you
can
not
suppose
such
a
thing
madame
my
skin
would
peel
off
if
i
were
to
expose
myself
to
such
a
burning
breeze
as
madame
began
to
laugh
you
can
take
my
parasol
she
said
but
the
trouble
of
holding
it
replied
monsieur
with
the
greatest
coolness
besides
i
have
no
what
no
horse
replied
the
princess
who
if
she
did
not
secure
the
solitude
she
required
at
least
obtained
the
amusement
of
teasing
no
horse
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
for
i
see
your
favorite
bay
out
my
bay
horse
exclaimed
the
prince
attempting
to
lean
forward
to
look
out
of
the
door
but
the
movement
he
was
obliged
to
make
cost
him
so
much
trouble
that
he
soon
hastened
to
resume
his
immobility
yes
said
madame
your
horse
led
by
de
poor
beast
replied
the
prince
how
warm
it
must
be
and
with
these
words
he
closed
his
eyes
like
a
man
on
the
point
of
death
madame
on
her
side
reclined
indolently
in
the
other
corner
of
the
carriage
and
closed
her
eyes
also
not
however
to
sleep
but
to
think
more
at
her
ease
in
the
meantime
the
king
seated
in
the
front
seat
of
his
carriage
the
back
of
which
he
had
yielded
up
to
the
two
queens
was
a
prey
to
that
feverish
contrariety
experienced
by
anxious
lovers
who
without
being
able
to
quench
their
ardent
thirst
are
ceaselessly
desirous
of
seeing
the
loved
object
and
then
go
away
partially
satisfied
without
perceiving
they
have
acquired
a
more
insatiable
thirst
than
ever
the
king
whose
carriage
headed
the
procession
could
not
from
the
place
he
occupied
perceive
the
carriages
of
the
ladies
and
maids
of
honor
which
followed
in
a
line
behind
it
besides
he
was
obliged
to
answer
the
eternal
questions
of
the
young
queen
who
happy
to
have
with
her
dear
as
she
called
him
in
utter
forgetfulness
of
royal
etiquette
invested
him
with
all
her
affection
stifled
him
with
her
attentions
afraid
that
some
one
might
come
to
take
him
from
her
or
that
he
himself
might
suddenly
take
a
fancy
to
quit
her
society
anne
of
austria
whom
nothing
at
that
moment
occupied
except
the
occasional
cruel
throbbings
in
her
bosom
looked
pleased
and
delighted
and
although
she
perfectly
realized
the
king
s
impatience
tantalizingly
prolonged
his
sufferings
by
unexpectedly
resuming
the
conversation
at
the
very
moment
the
king
absorbed
in
his
own
reflections
began
to
muse
over
his
secret
attachment
everything
seemed
to
combine
not
alone
the
little
teasing
attentions
of
the
queen
but
also
the
s
interruptions
to
make
the
king
s
position
almost
insupportable
for
he
knew
not
how
to
control
the
restless
longings
of
his
heart
at
first
he
complained
of
the
heat
a
complaint
merely
preliminary
to
others
but
with
sufficient
tact
to
prevent
maria
theresa
guessing
his
real
object
understanding
the
king
s
remark
literally
she
began
to
fan
him
with
her
ostrich
plumes
but
the
heat
passed
away
and
the
king
then
complained
of
cramps
and
stiffness
in
his
legs
and
as
the
carriages
at
that
moment
stopped
to
change
horses
the
queen
said
shall
i
get
out
with
you
i
too
feel
tired
of
sitting
we
can
walk
on
a
little
distance
the
carriage
will
overtake
us
and
we
can
resume
our
places
the
king
frowned
it
is
a
hard
trial
a
jealous
woman
makes
her
husband
submit
to
whose
fidelity
she
suspects
when
although
herself
a
prey
to
jealousy
she
watches
herself
so
narrowly
that
she
avoids
giving
any
pretext
for
an
angry
feeling
the
king
therefore
in
the
present
case
could
not
refuse
he
accepted
the
offer
alighted
from
the
carriage
gave
his
arm
to
the
queen
and
walked
up
and
down
with
her
while
the
horses
were
being
changed
as
he
walked
along
he
cast
an
envious
glance
upon
the
courtiers
who
were
fortunate
enough
to
be
on
horseback
the
queen
soon
found
out
that
the
promenade
she
had
suggested
afforded
the
king
as
little
pleasure
as
he
had
experienced
from
driving
she
accordingly
expressed
a
wish
to
return
to
her
carriage
and
the
king
conducted
her
to
the
door
but
did
not
get
in
with
her
he
stepped
back
a
few
paces
and
looked
along
the
file
of
carriages
for
the
purpose
of
recognizing
the
one
in
which
he
took
so
strong
an
interest
at
the
door
of
the
sixth
carriage
he
saw
la
valliere
s
fair
countenance
as
the
king
thus
stood
motionless
wrapt
in
thought
without
perceiving
that
everything
was
ready
and
that
he
alone
was
causing
the
delay
he
heard
a
voice
close
beside
him
addressing
him
in
the
most
respectful
manner
it
was
malicorne
in
a
complete
costume
of
an
equerry
holding
over
his
left
arm
the
bridles
of
a
couple
of
horses
your
majesty
asked
for
a
horse
i
believe
he
said
a
horse
have
you
one
of
my
horses
here
inquired
the
king
trying
to
remember
the
person
who
addressed
him
and
whose
face
was
not
as
yet
familiar
to
him
sire
replied
malicorne
at
all
events
i
have
a
horse
here
which
is
at
your
majesty
s
and
malicorne
pointed
at
monsieur
s
bay
horse
which
madame
had
observed
it
was
a
beautiful
creature
royally
caparisoned
this
is
not
one
of
my
horses
monsieur
said
the
king
sire
it
is
a
horse
out
of
his
royal
highness
s
stables
but
he
does
not
ride
when
the
weather
is
as
hot
as
it
is
louis
did
not
reply
but
approached
the
horse
which
stood
pawing
the
ground
with
its
foot
malicorne
hastened
to
hold
the
stirrup
for
him
but
the
king
was
already
in
the
saddle
restored
to
by
this
lucky
accident
the
king
hastened
towards
the
queen
s
carriage
where
he
was
anxiously
expected
and
notwithstanding
maria
theresa
s
thoughtful
and
preoccupied
air
he
said
i
have
been
fortunate
enough
to
find
this
horse
and
i
intend
to
avail
myself
of
it
i
felt
stifled
in
the
carriage
adieu
then
bending
gracefully
over
the
arched
neck
of
his
beautiful
steed
he
disappeared
in
a
second
anne
of
austria
leaned
forward
in
order
to
look
after
him
as
he
rode
away
he
did
not
get
very
far
for
when
he
reached
the
sixth
carriage
he
reined
in
his
horse
suddenly
and
took
off
his
hat
he
saluted
la
valliere
who
uttered
a
cry
of
surprise
as
she
saw
him
blushing
at
the
same
time
with
pleasure
montalais
who
occupied
the
other
seat
in
the
carriage
made
the
king
a
most
respectful
bow
and
then
with
all
the
tact
of
a
woman
she
pretended
to
be
exceedingly
interested
in
the
landscape
and
withdrew
herself
into
the
corner
the
conversation
between
the
king
and
la
valliere
began
as
all
lovers
conversations
generally
do
namely
by
eloquent
looks
and
by
a
few
words
utterly
devoid
of
common
sense
the
king
explained
how
warm
he
had
felt
in
his
carriage
so
much
so
indeed
that
he
could
almost
regard
the
horse
he
then
rode
as
a
blessing
thrown
in
his
way
and
he
added
my
benefactor
is
an
exceedingly
intelligent
man
for
he
seemed
to
guess
my
thoughts
intuitively
i
have
now
only
one
wish
that
of
learning
the
name
of
the
gentleman
who
so
cleverly
assisted
his
king
out
of
his
dilemma
and
extricated
him
from
his
cruel
montalais
during
this
colloquy
the
first
words
of
which
had
awakened
her
attention
had
slightly
altered
her
position
and
contrived
so
as
to
meet
the
king
s
look
as
he
finished
his
remark
it
followed
very
naturally
that
the
king
looked
inquiringly
as
much
at
her
as
at
la
valliere
she
had
every
reason
to
suppose
that
it
was
herself
who
was
appealed
to
and
consequently
might
be
permitted
to
answer
she
therefore
said
sire
the
horse
which
your
majesty
is
riding
belongs
to
monsieur
and
was
being
led
by
one
of
his
royal
highness
s
and
what
is
that
gentleman
s
name
may
i
ask
mademoiselle
m
de
malicorne
the
name
produced
its
usual
effect
for
the
king
repeated
it
smilingly
yes
sire
replied
aure
stay
it
is
the
gentleman
who
is
galloping
on
my
left
hand
and
she
pointed
out
malicorne
who
with
a
very
sanctified
expression
was
galloping
by
the
side
of
the
carriage
knowing
perfectly
well
that
they
were
talking
of
him
at
that
very
moment
but
sitting
in
his
saddle
as
if
he
were
deaf
and
dumb
yes
said
the
king
that
is
the
gentleman
i
remember
his
face
and
will
not
forget
his
name
and
the
king
looked
tenderly
at
la
valliere
aure
had
now
nothing
further
to
do
she
had
let
malicorne
s
name
fall
the
soil
was
good
all
that
was
now
left
to
be
done
was
to
let
the
name
take
root
and
the
event
would
bear
fruit
in
due
season
she
consequently
threw
herself
back
in
her
corner
feeling
perfectly
justified
in
making
as
many
agreeable
signs
of
recognition
as
she
liked
to
malicorne
since
the
latter
had
had
the
happiness
of
pleasing
the
king
as
will
readily
be
believed
montalais
was
not
mistaken
and
malicorne
with
his
quick
ear
and
his
sly
look
seemed
to
interpret
her
remark
as
all
goes
on
well
the
whole
being
accompanied
by
a
pantomimic
action
which
he
fancied
conveyed
something
resembling
a
kiss
alas
mademoiselle
said
the
king
after
a
moment
s
pause
the
liberty
and
freedom
of
the
country
is
soon
about
to
cease
your
attendance
on
madame
will
be
more
strictly
enforced
and
we
shall
see
each
other
no
your
majesty
is
too
much
attached
to
madame
replied
louise
not
to
come
and
see
her
very
frequently
and
whenever
your
majesty
may
chance
to
pass
across
the
apartments
ah
said
the
king
in
a
tender
voice
which
was
gradually
lowered
in
its
tone
to
perceive
is
not
to
see
and
yet
it
seems
that
it
would
be
quite
sufficient
for
louise
did
not
answer
a
syllable
a
sigh
filled
her
heart
almost
to
bursting
but
she
stifled
it
you
exercise
a
great
control
over
yourself
said
the
king
to
louise
who
smiled
upon
him
with
a
melancholy
expression
exert
the
strength
you
have
in
loving
fondly
he
continued
and
i
will
bless
heaven
for
having
bestowed
it
on
la
valliere
still
remained
silent
but
raised
her
eyes
brimful
of
affection
toward
the
king
louis
as
if
overcome
by
this
burning
glance
passed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
pressing
the
sides
of
his
horse
with
his
knees
made
him
bound
several
paces
forward
la
valliere
leaning
back
in
her
carriage
with
her
eyes
half
closed
gazed
fixedly
upon
the
king
whose
plumes
were
floating
in
the
air
she
could
not
but
admire
his
graceful
carriage
his
delicate
and
nervous
limbs
which
pressed
his
horse
s
sides
and
the
regular
outline
of
his
features
which
his
beautiful
curling
hair
set
off
to
great
advantage
revealing
occasionally
his
small
and
ear
in
fact
the
poor
girl
was
in
love
and
she
reveled
in
her
innocent
affection
in
a
few
moments
the
king
was
again
by
her
side
do
you
not
perceive
he
said
how
terribly
your
silence
affects
me
oh
mademoiselle
how
pitilessly
inexorable
you
would
become
if
you
were
ever
to
resolve
to
break
off
all
acquaintance
with
any
one
and
then
too
i
think
you
changeable
in
fact
in
fact
i
dread
this
deep
affection
which
fills
my
whole
oh
sire
you
are
mistaken
said
la
valliere
if
ever
i
love
it
will
be
for
all
my
if
you
love
you
say
exclaimed
the
king
you
do
love
now
then
she
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
you
see
said
the
king
that
i
am
right
in
accusing
you
you
must
admit
you
are
changeable
capricious
a
coquette
oh
no
sire
be
perfectly
satisfied
as
to
that
no
i
say
again
no
no
promise
me
then
that
to
me
you
will
always
be
the
oh
always
that
you
will
never
show
any
of
that
severity
which
would
break
my
heart
none
of
that
fickleness
of
manner
which
would
be
worse
than
death
to
oh
no
very
well
then
but
listen
i
like
promises
i
like
to
place
under
the
guarantee
of
an
oath
under
the
protection
of
heaven
in
fact
everything
which
interests
my
heart
and
my
affections
promise
me
or
rather
swear
to
me
that
if
in
the
life
we
are
about
to
commence
a
life
which
will
be
full
of
sacrifice
mystery
anxiety
disappointment
and
misunderstanding
swear
to
me
that
if
we
should
in
any
way
deceive
or
misunderstand
each
other
or
should
judge
each
other
unjustly
for
that
indeed
would
be
criminal
in
love
such
as
ours
swear
to
me
louise
she
trembled
with
agitation
to
the
very
depths
of
her
heart
it
was
the
first
time
she
had
heard
her
name
pronounced
in
that
manner
by
her
royal
lover
as
for
the
king
taking
off
his
glove
and
placing
his
hand
within
the
carriage
he
continued
swear
that
never
in
all
our
quarrels
will
we
allow
one
night
even
to
pass
by
if
any
misunderstanding
should
arise
between
us
without
a
visit
or
at
least
a
message
from
either
in
order
to
convey
consolation
and
repose
to
the
la
valliere
took
her
lover
s
burning
hand
between
her
own
cool
palms
and
pressed
it
softly
until
a
movement
of
the
horse
frightened
by
the
proximity
of
the
wheels
obliged
her
to
abandon
her
happiness
she
had
vowed
as
he
desired
return
sire
she
said
return
to
the
queen
i
foresee
a
storm
yonder
which
threatens
my
peace
of
mind
and
louis
obeyed
saluted
mademoiselle
de
montalais
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
to
rejoin
the
queen
as
he
passed
monsieur
s
carriage
he
observed
that
he
was
fast
asleep
although
madame
on
her
part
was
wide
awake
as
the
king
passed
her
she
said
what
a
beautiful
horse
sire
is
it
not
monsieur
s
bay
horse
the
young
queen
kindly
asked
are
you
better
now
sire
chapter
xxiii
triumfeminate
on
the
king
s
arrival
in
paris
he
sat
at
the
council
which
had
been
summoned
and
worked
for
a
certain
portion
of
the
day
the
queen
remained
with
the
and
burst
into
tears
as
soon
as
she
had
taken
leave
of
the
king
ah
madame
she
said
the
king
no
longer
loves
me
what
will
become
of
me
a
husband
always
loves
his
wife
when
she
is
like
you
replied
anne
of
austria
a
time
may
come
when
he
will
love
another
woman
instead
of
what
do
you
call
loving
always
thinking
of
a
person
always
seeking
her
do
you
happen
to
have
remarked
said
anne
of
austria
that
the
king
has
ever
done
anything
of
the
sort
no
madame
said
the
young
queen
hesitatingly
what
is
there
to
complain
of
then
marie
you
will
admit
that
the
king
leaves
me
the
king
my
daughter
belongs
to
his
and
that
is
the
very
reason
why
he
no
longer
belongs
to
me
and
that
is
the
reason
too
why
i
shall
find
myself
as
so
many
queens
before
me
forsaken
and
forgotten
whilst
glory
and
honors
will
be
reserved
for
others
oh
my
mother
the
king
is
so
handsome
how
often
will
others
tell
him
that
they
love
him
and
how
much
indeed
they
must
do
so
it
is
very
seldom
indeed
that
women
love
the
man
in
loving
the
king
but
if
such
a
thing
happened
which
i
doubt
you
would
do
better
to
wish
marie
that
such
women
should
really
love
your
husband
in
the
first
place
the
devoted
love
of
a
mistress
is
a
rapid
element
of
the
dissolution
of
a
lover
s
affection
and
then
by
dint
of
loving
the
mistress
loses
all
influence
over
her
lover
whose
power
of
wealth
she
does
not
covet
caring
only
for
his
affection
wish
therefore
that
the
king
should
love
but
lightly
and
that
his
mistress
should
love
with
all
her
oh
my
mother
what
power
may
not
a
deep
affection
exercise
over
him
and
yet
you
say
you
are
resigned
quite
true
quite
true
i
speak
absurdly
there
is
a
feeling
of
anguish
however
which
i
can
never
and
that
is
the
king
may
make
a
happy
choice
may
find
a
home
with
all
the
tender
influences
of
home
not
far
from
that
we
can
offer
him
a
home
with
children
round
him
the
children
of
another
woman
oh
madame
i
should
die
if
i
were
but
to
see
the
king
s
marie
marie
replied
the
with
a
smile
and
she
took
the
young
queen
s
hand
in
her
own
remember
what
i
am
going
to
say
and
let
it
always
be
a
consolation
to
you
the
king
can
not
have
a
dauphin
without
with
this
remark
the
quitted
her
in
order
to
meet
madame
whose
arrival
in
the
grand
cabinet
had
just
been
announced
by
one
of
the
pages
madame
had
scarcely
taken
time
to
change
her
dress
her
face
revealed
her
agitation
which
betrayed
a
plan
the
execution
of
which
occupied
while
the
result
disturbed
her
mind
i
came
to
ascertain
she
said
if
your
majesties
are
suffering
any
fatigue
from
our
none
at
all
said
the
a
little
replied
maria
theresa
i
have
suffered
from
annoyance
more
than
anything
else
said
madame
how
was
that
inquired
anne
of
austria
the
fatigue
the
king
undergoes
in
riding
about
on
that
does
the
king
and
it
was
i
who
advised
him
said
maria
theresa
turning
pale
madame
said
not
a
word
in
reply
but
one
of
those
smiles
which
were
peculiarly
her
own
flitted
for
a
moment
across
her
lips
without
passing
over
the
rest
of
her
face
then
immediately
changing
the
conversation
she
continued
we
shall
find
paris
precisely
the
paris
we
quitted
the
same
intrigues
plots
and
flirtations
going
intrigues
what
intrigues
do
you
allude
to
inquired
the
people
are
talking
a
good
deal
about
fouquet
and
madame
who
makes
up
the
number
to
about
ten
thousand
replied
the
but
what
are
the
plots
you
speak
of
we
have
it
seems
certain
misunderstandings
with
holland
to
what
about
monsieur
has
been
telling
me
the
story
of
the
oh
exclaimed
the
young
queen
you
mean
those
medals
struck
in
holland
on
which
a
cloud
is
seen
passing
across
the
sun
which
is
the
king
s
device
you
are
wrong
in
calling
that
a
plot
it
is
an
but
so
contemptible
that
the
king
can
well
despise
it
replied
the
well
what
are
the
flirtations
which
are
alluded
to
do
you
mean
that
of
madame
d
olonne
no
no
nearer
ourselves
than
de
murmured
the
and
without
moving
her
lips
in
her
s
ear
without
being
overheard
by
madame
who
thus
continued
you
know
the
terrible
news
oh
yes
de
guiche
s
and
you
attribute
it
i
suppose
as
every
one
else
does
to
an
accident
which
happened
to
him
while
hunting
yes
of
course
said
both
the
queens
together
their
interest
awakened
madame
drew
closer
to
them
as
she
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
it
was
a
ah
said
anne
of
austria
in
a
severe
tone
for
in
her
ears
the
word
duel
which
had
been
forbidden
in
france
all
the
time
she
reigned
over
it
had
a
strange
sound
a
most
deplorable
duel
which
has
nearly
cost
monsieur
two
of
his
best
friends
and
the
king
two
of
his
best
what
was
the
cause
of
the
duel
inquired
the
young
queen
animated
by
a
secret
instinct
flirtation
repeated
madame
triumphantly
the
gentlemen
in
question
were
conversing
about
the
virtue
of
a
particular
lady
belonging
to
the
court
one
of
them
thought
that
pallas
was
a
very
person
compared
to
her
the
other
pretended
that
the
lady
in
question
was
an
imitation
of
venus
alluring
mars
and
thereupon
the
two
gentlemen
fought
as
fiercely
as
hector
and
venus
alluring
mars
said
the
young
queen
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
without
venturing
to
examine
into
the
allegory
very
deeply
who
is
the
lady
inquired
anne
of
austria
abruptly
you
said
i
believe
she
was
one
of
the
ladies
of
honor
did
i
say
so
replied
madame
yes
at
least
i
thought
i
heard
you
mention
are
you
not
aware
that
such
a
woman
is
of
to
a
royal
house
is
it
not
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
said
the
yes
indeed
that
i
thought
she
was
affianced
to
a
gentleman
who
certainly
is
not
at
least
so
i
have
heard
either
de
guiche
or
de
wardes
very
possibly
the
young
queen
took
up
a
piece
of
tapestry
and
began
to
broider
with
an
affectation
of
tranquillity
her
trembling
fingers
contradicted
what
were
you
saying
about
venus
and
mars
pursued
the
is
there
a
mars
also
she
boasts
of
that
being
the
did
you
say
she
boasts
of
it
that
was
the
cause
of
the
and
de
guiche
upheld
the
cause
of
mars
yes
certainly
like
the
devoted
servant
he
the
devoted
servant
of
whom
exclaimed
the
young
queen
forgetting
her
reserve
in
allowing
her
jealous
feeling
to
escape
mars
not
to
be
defended
except
at
the
expense
of
venus
replied
madame
m
de
guiche
maintained
the
perfect
innocence
of
mars
and
no
doubt
affirmed
that
it
was
all
a
mere
and
de
wardes
said
anne
of
austria
quietly
spread
the
report
that
venus
was
within
her
rights
i
suppose
oh
de
wardes
thought
madame
you
shall
pay
dearly
for
the
wound
you
have
given
that
noblest
best
of
men
and
she
began
to
attack
de
wardes
with
the
greatest
bitterness
thus
discharging
her
own
and
de
guiche
s
debt
with
the
assurance
that
she
was
working
the
future
ruin
of
her
enemy
she
said
so
much
in
fact
that
had
manicamp
been
there
he
would
have
regretted
he
had
shown
such
firm
regard
for
his
friend
inasmuch
as
it
resulted
in
the
ruin
of
his
unfortunate
foe
i
see
nothing
in
the
whole
affair
but
cause
of
mischief
and
that
is
la
valliere
herself
said
the
the
young
queen
resumed
her
work
with
perfect
indifference
of
manner
while
madame
listened
eagerly
i
do
not
yet
quite
understand
what
you
said
just
now
about
the
danger
of
coquetry
resumed
anne
of
austria
it
is
quite
true
madame
hastened
to
say
that
if
the
girl
had
not
been
a
coquette
mars
would
not
have
thought
at
all
about
the
repetition
of
this
word
mars
brought
a
passing
color
to
the
queen
s
face
but
she
still
continued
her
work
i
will
not
permit
that
in
my
court
gentlemen
should
be
set
against
each
other
in
this
manner
said
anne
of
austria
calmly
such
manners
were
useful
enough
perhaps
in
days
when
the
divided
nobility
had
no
other
than
mere
gallantry
at
that
time
women
whose
sway
was
absolute
and
undivided
were
privileged
to
encourage
men
s
valor
by
frequent
trials
of
their
courage
but
now
thank
heaven
there
is
but
one
master
in
france
and
to
him
every
instinct
of
the
mind
every
pulse
of
the
body
are
due
i
will
not
allow
my
son
to
be
deprived
of
any
single
one
of
his
and
she
turned
towards
the
young
queen
saying
what
is
to
be
done
with
this
la
valliere
la
valliere
said
the
queen
apparently
surprised
i
do
not
even
know
the
name
and
she
accompanied
this
remark
by
one
of
those
cold
fixed
smiles
only
to
be
observed
on
royal
lips
madame
was
herself
a
princess
great
in
every
respect
great
in
intelligence
great
by
birth
by
pride
the
queen
s
reply
however
completely
astonished
her
and
she
was
obliged
to
pause
for
a
moment
in
order
to
recover
herself
she
is
one
of
my
maids
of
honor
she
replied
with
a
bow
in
that
case
retorted
maria
theresa
in
the
same
tone
it
is
your
affair
my
sister
and
not
i
beg
your
pardon
resumed
anne
of
austria
it
is
my
affair
and
i
perfectly
well
understand
she
pursued
addressing
a
look
full
of
intelligence
at
madame
madame
s
motive
for
saying
what
she
has
just
everything
which
emanates
from
you
madame
said
the
english
princess
proceeds
from
the
lips
of
if
we
send
this
girl
back
to
her
own
family
said
maria
theresa
gently
we
must
bestow
a
pension
upon
which
i
will
provide
for
out
of
my
income
exclaimed
madame
no
no
interrupted
anne
of
austria
no
disturbance
i
beg
the
king
dislikes
that
the
slightest
disrespectful
remark
should
be
made
of
any
lady
let
everything
be
done
quietly
will
you
have
the
kindness
madame
to
send
for
this
girl
here
and
you
my
daughter
will
have
the
goodness
to
retire
to
your
own
the
dowager
queen
s
entreaties
were
commands
and
as
maria
theresa
rose
to
return
to
her
apartments
madame
rose
in
order
to
send
a
page
to
summon
la
valliere
chapter
xxiv
the
first
quarrel
la
valliere
entered
the
s
apartments
without
in
the
least
suspecting
that
a
serious
plot
was
being
concerted
against
her
she
thought
it
was
for
something
connected
with
her
duties
and
never
had
the
been
unkind
to
her
when
such
was
the
case
besides
not
being
immediately
under
the
control
or
direction
of
anne
of
austria
she
could
only
have
an
official
connection
with
her
to
which
her
own
gentleness
of
disposition
and
the
rank
of
the
august
princess
made
her
yield
on
every
occasion
with
the
best
possible
grace
she
therefore
advanced
towards
the
with
that
soft
and
gentle
smile
which
constituted
her
principal
charm
and
as
she
did
not
approach
sufficiently
close
anne
of
austria
signed
to
her
to
come
nearer
madame
then
entered
the
room
and
with
a
perfectly
calm
air
took
her
seat
beside
her
and
continued
the
work
which
maria
theresa
had
begun
when
la
valliere
instead
of
the
direction
which
she
expected
to
receive
immediately
on
entering
the
room
perceived
these
preparations
she
looked
with
curiosity
if
not
with
uneasiness
at
the
two
princesses
anne
seemed
full
of
thought
while
madame
maintained
an
affectation
of
indifference
that
would
have
alarmed
a
less
timid
person
even
than
louise
mademoiselle
said
the
suddenly
without
attempting
to
moderate
or
disguise
her
spanish
accent
which
she
never
failed
to
do
except
when
she
was
angry
come
closer
we
were
talking
of
you
as
every
one
else
seems
to
be
of
me
exclaimed
la
valliere
turning
pale
do
you
pretend
to
be
ignorant
of
it
are
you
not
aware
of
the
duel
between
de
guiche
and
de
wardes
oh
madame
i
heard
of
it
yesterday
said
la
valliere
clasping
her
hands
together
and
did
you
not
foresee
this
quarrel
why
should
i
madame
because
two
men
never
fight
without
a
motive
and
because
you
must
be
aware
of
the
motive
which
awakened
the
animosity
of
the
two
in
i
am
perfectly
ignorant
of
it
a
persevering
denial
is
a
very
commonplace
mode
of
defense
and
you
who
have
great
pretensions
to
be
witty
and
clever
ought
to
avoid
commonplaces
what
else
have
you
to
say
oh
madame
your
majesty
terrifies
me
with
your
cold
severity
of
manner
but
i
do
not
understand
how
i
can
have
incurred
your
displeasure
or
in
what
respect
people
concern
themselves
about
then
i
will
tell
you
de
guiche
has
been
obliged
to
undertake
your
my
defense
yes
he
is
a
gallant
knight
and
beautiful
adventuresses
like
to
see
brave
knights
couch
lances
in
their
honor
but
for
my
part
i
hate
fields
of
battle
and
above
all
i
hate
adventures
and
take
my
remark
as
you
la
valliere
sank
at
the
queen
s
feet
who
turned
her
back
upon
her
she
stretched
out
her
hands
towards
madame
who
laughed
in
her
face
a
feeling
of
pride
made
her
rise
to
her
feet
i
have
begged
your
majesty
to
tell
me
what
is
the
crime
i
am
accused
of
i
can
claim
this
at
your
hands
and
i
see
i
am
condemned
before
i
am
even
permitted
to
justify
eh
indeed
cried
anne
of
austria
listen
to
her
beautiful
phrases
madame
and
to
her
fine
sentiments
she
is
an
inexhaustible
well
of
tenderness
and
heroic
expressions
one
can
easily
see
young
lady
that
you
have
cultivated
your
mind
in
the
society
of
crowned
la
valliere
felt
struck
to
the
heart
she
became
not
whiter
but
as
white
as
a
lily
and
all
her
strength
forsook
her
i
wished
to
inform
you
interrupted
the
queen
disdainfully
that
if
you
continue
to
nourish
such
feelings
you
will
humiliate
us
to
such
a
degree
that
we
shall
be
ashamed
of
appearing
before
you
be
simple
in
your
manners
by
the
by
i
am
informed
that
you
are
affianced
is
it
the
case
la
valliere
pressed
her
hand
over
her
heart
which
was
wrung
with
a
fresh
pang
answer
when
you
are
spoken
to
yes
to
a
gentleman
yes
his
name
the
vicomte
de
are
you
aware
that
it
is
an
exceedingly
fortunate
circumstance
for
you
mademoiselle
that
such
is
the
case
and
without
fortune
or
position
as
you
are
or
without
any
very
great
personal
advantages
you
ought
to
bless
heaven
for
having
procured
you
such
a
future
as
seems
to
be
in
store
for
you
la
valliere
did
not
reply
where
is
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
pursued
the
queen
in
england
said
madame
where
the
report
of
this
young
lady
s
success
will
not
fail
to
reach
oh
heaven
murmured
la
valliere
in
despair
very
well
mademoiselle
said
anne
of
austria
we
will
get
this
young
gentleman
to
return
and
send
you
away
somewhere
with
him
if
you
are
of
a
different
opinion
for
girls
have
strange
views
and
fancies
at
times
trust
to
me
i
will
put
you
in
a
proper
path
again
i
have
done
as
much
for
girls
who
are
not
as
good
as
you
are
la
valliere
ceased
to
hear
the
queen
who
pitilessly
added
i
will
send
you
somewhere
by
yourself
where
you
will
be
able
to
indulge
in
a
little
serious
reflection
reflection
calms
the
ardor
of
the
blood
and
swallows
up
the
illusions
of
youth
i
suppose
you
understand
what
i
have
been
saying
madame
not
a
word
i
am
innocent
of
everything
your
majesty
supposes
oh
madame
you
are
a
witness
of
my
despair
i
love
i
respect
your
majesty
so
it
would
be
far
better
not
to
respect
me
at
all
said
the
queen
with
a
chilling
irony
of
manner
it
would
be
far
better
if
you
were
not
innocent
do
you
presume
to
suppose
that
i
should
be
satisfied
simply
to
leave
you
unpunished
if
you
had
committed
the
fault
oh
madame
you
are
killing
no
acting
if
you
please
or
i
will
precipitate
the
of
this
leave
the
room
return
to
your
own
apartment
and
i
trust
my
lesson
may
be
of
service
to
madame
said
la
valliere
to
the
duchess
d
orleans
whose
hands
she
seized
in
her
own
do
you
who
are
so
good
intercede
for
me
i
replied
the
latter
with
an
insulting
joy
i
good
ah
mademoiselle
you
think
nothing
of
the
kind
and
with
a
rude
hasty
gesture
she
repulsed
the
young
girl
s
grasp
la
valliere
instead
of
giving
way
as
from
her
extreme
pallor
and
her
tears
the
two
princesses
possibly
expected
suddenly
resumed
her
calm
and
dignified
air
she
bowed
profoundly
and
left
the
room
well
said
anne
of
austria
to
madame
do
you
think
she
will
begin
again
i
always
suspect
those
gentle
patient
characters
replied
madame
nothing
is
more
full
of
courage
than
a
patient
heart
nothing
more
than
a
gentle
i
feel
i
may
almost
venture
to
assure
you
she
will
think
twice
before
she
looks
at
the
god
mars
so
long
as
she
does
not
obtain
the
protection
of
his
buckler
i
do
not
care
retorted
madame
a
proud
defiant
look
of
the
was
the
reply
to
this
objection
which
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
finesse
and
both
of
them
almost
sure
of
their
victory
went
to
look
for
maria
theresa
who
had
been
waiting
for
them
with
impatience
it
was
about
six
in
the
evening
and
the
king
had
just
partaken
of
refreshment
he
lost
no
time
but
the
repast
finished
and
business
matters
settled
he
took
by
the
arm
and
desired
him
to
lead
the
way
to
la
valliere
s
apartments
the
courtier
uttered
an
exclamation
well
what
is
that
for
it
is
a
habit
you
will
have
to
adopt
and
in
order
to
adopt
a
habit
one
must
make
a
oh
sire
said
it
is
hardly
possible
for
every
one
can
be
seen
entering
or
leaving
those
apartments
if
however
some
pretext
or
other
were
made
use
of
if
your
majesty
for
instance
would
wait
until
madame
were
in
her
own
apartments
no
pretext
no
delays
i
have
had
enough
of
these
impediments
and
mysteries
i
can
not
perceive
in
what
respect
the
king
of
france
dishonors
himself
by
conversing
with
an
amiable
and
clever
girl
evil
be
to
him
who
evil
will
your
majesty
forgive
an
excess
of
zeal
on
my
part
speak
how
about
the
queen
true
true
i
always
wish
the
most
entire
respect
to
be
shown
to
her
majesty
well
then
this
evening
only
will
i
pay
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
a
visit
and
after
i
will
make
use
of
any
pretext
you
like
we
will
devise
all
sorts
of
means
i
have
no
made
no
reply
he
descended
the
steps
preceding
the
king
and
crossed
the
different
courtyards
with
a
feeling
of
shame
which
the
distinguished
honor
of
accompanying
the
king
did
not
remove
the
reason
was
that
wished
to
stand
well
with
madame
as
well
as
with
the
queens
and
also
that
he
did
not
on
the
other
hand
want
to
displease
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
and
in
order
to
carry
out
so
many
promising
affairs
it
was
difficult
to
avoid
jostling
against
some
obstacle
or
other
besides
the
windows
of
the
young
queen
s
rooms
those
of
the
s
and
of
madame
herself
looked
out
upon
the
courtyard
of
the
maids
of
honor
to
be
seen
therefore
accompanying
the
king
would
be
effectually
to
quarrel
with
three
great
and
influential
princesses
whose
authority
was
unbounded
for
the
purpose
of
supporting
the
ephemeral
credit
of
a
mistress
the
unhappy
who
had
not
displayed
a
very
great
amount
of
courage
in
taking
la
valliere
s
part
in
the
park
of
fontainebleau
did
not
feel
any
braver
in
the
broad
and
found
a
thousand
defects
in
the
poor
girl
which
he
was
most
eager
to
communicate
to
the
king
but
his
trial
soon
finished
the
courtyards
were
crossed
not
a
curtain
was
drawn
aside
nor
a
window
opened
the
king
walked
hastily
because
of
his
impatience
and
the
long
legs
of
who
preceded
him
at
the
door
however
wished
to
retire
but
the
king
desired
him
to
remain
a
delicate
consideration
on
the
king
s
part
which
the
courtier
could
very
well
have
dispensed
with
he
had
to
follow
louis
into
la
valliere
s
apartment
as
soon
as
the
king
arrived
the
young
girl
dried
her
tears
but
so
precipitately
that
the
king
perceived
it
he
questioned
her
most
anxiously
and
tenderly
and
pressed
her
to
tell
him
the
cause
of
her
emotion
nothing
is
the
matter
sire
she
said
and
yet
you
were
weeping
oh
no
indeed
look
and
tell
me
if
i
am
ought
to
have
answered
but
he
was
too
much
embarrassed
at
all
events
your
eyes
are
red
mademoiselle
said
the
king
the
dust
of
the
road
merely
no
no
you
no
longer
possess
the
air
of
supreme
contentment
which
renders
you
so
beautiful
and
so
attractive
you
do
not
look
at
me
why
avoid
my
gaze
he
said
as
she
turned
aside
her
head
in
heaven
s
name
what
is
the
matter
he
inquired
beginning
to
lose
command
over
himself
nothing
at
all
sire
and
i
am
perfectly
ready
to
assure
your
majesty
that
my
mind
is
as
free
from
anxiety
as
you
could
possibly
your
mind
at
ease
when
i
see
you
are
embarrassed
at
the
slightest
thing
has
any
one
annoyed
you
no
no
i
insist
upon
knowing
if
such
really
be
the
case
said
the
prince
his
eyes
sparkling
no
one
sire
no
one
has
in
any
way
offended
in
that
case
pray
resume
your
gentle
air
of
gayety
or
that
sweet
melancholy
look
which
i
so
loved
in
you
this
morning
for
pity
s
sake
do
yes
sire
the
king
tapped
the
floor
impatiently
with
his
foot
saying
such
a
change
is
positively
and
he
looked
at
who
had
also
remarked
la
valliere
s
peculiar
lethargy
as
well
as
the
king
s
impatience
it
was
futile
for
the
king
to
entreat
and
as
useless
for
him
to
try
to
overcome
her
depression
the
poor
girl
was
completely
overwhelmed
the
appearance
of
an
angel
would
hardly
have
awakened
her
from
her
torpor
the
king
saw
in
her
repeated
negative
replies
a
mystery
full
of
unkindness
he
began
to
look
round
the
apartment
with
a
suspicious
air
there
happened
to
be
in
la
valliere
s
room
a
miniature
of
athos
the
king
remarked
that
this
portrait
bore
a
strong
resemblance
to
bragelonne
for
it
had
been
taken
when
the
count
was
quite
a
young
man
he
looked
at
it
with
a
threatening
air
la
valliere
in
her
misery
far
indeed
from
thinking
of
this
portrait
could
not
conjecture
the
cause
of
the
king
s
preoccupation
and
yet
the
king
s
mind
was
occupied
with
a
terrible
remembrance
which
had
more
than
once
taken
possession
of
his
mind
but
which
he
had
always
driven
away
he
recalled
the
intimacy
existing
between
the
two
young
people
from
their
birth
their
engagement
and
that
athos
himself
had
come
to
solicit
la
valliere
s
hand
for
raoul
he
therefore
could
not
but
suppose
that
on
her
return
to
paris
la
valliere
had
found
news
from
london
awaiting
her
and
that
this
news
had
counterbalanced
the
influence
he
had
been
enabled
to
exert
over
her
he
immediately
felt
himself
stung
as
it
were
by
feelings
of
the
wildest
jealousy
and
again
questioned
her
with
increased
bitterness
la
valliere
could
not
reply
unless
she
were
to
acknowledge
everything
which
would
be
to
accuse
the
queen
and
madame
also
and
the
consequence
would
be
that
she
would
have
to
enter
into
an
open
warfare
with
these
two
great
and
powerful
princesses
she
thought
within
herself
that
as
she
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
from
the
king
what
was
passing
in
her
own
mind
the
king
ought
to
be
able
to
read
in
her
heart
in
spite
of
her
silence
and
that
had
he
really
loved
her
he
would
have
understood
and
guessed
everything
what
was
sympathy
then
if
not
that
divine
flame
which
possesses
the
property
of
enlightening
the
heart
and
of
saving
lovers
the
necessity
of
an
expression
of
their
thoughts
and
feelings
she
maintained
her
silence
therefore
sighing
and
concealing
her
face
in
her
hands
these
sighs
and
tears
which
had
at
first
distressed
then
terrified
louis
now
irritated
him
he
could
not
bear
opposition
the
opposition
which
tears
and
sighs
exhibited
any
more
than
opposition
of
any
other
kind
his
remarks
therefore
became
bitter
urgent
and
openly
aggressive
in
their
nature
this
was
a
fresh
cause
of
distress
for
the
poor
girl
from
that
very
circumstance
therefore
which
she
regarded
as
an
injustice
on
her
lover
s
part
she
drew
sufficient
courage
to
bear
not
only
her
other
troubles
but
this
one
also
the
king
next
began
to
accuse
her
in
direct
terms
la
valliere
did
not
even
attempt
to
defend
herself
she
endured
all
his
accusations
without
according
any
other
reply
than
that
of
shaking
her
head
without
any
other
remark
than
that
which
escapes
the
heart
in
deep
distress
a
prayerful
appeal
to
heaven
for
help
but
this
ejaculation
instead
of
calming
the
king
s
displeasure
rather
increased
it
he
moreover
saw
himself
seconded
by
for
as
we
have
observed
having
seen
the
storm
increasing
and
not
knowing
the
extent
of
the
regard
of
which
louis
xiv
was
capable
felt
by
anticipation
all
the
collected
wrath
of
the
three
princesses
and
the
near
approach
of
poor
la
valliere
s
downfall
and
he
was
not
true
knight
enough
to
resist
the
fear
that
he
himself
might
be
dragged
down
in
the
impending
ruin
did
not
reply
to
the
king
s
questions
except
by
short
dry
remarks
pronounced
and
by
abrupt
gestures
whose
object
was
to
make
things
worse
and
bring
about
a
misunderstanding
the
result
of
which
would
be
to
free
him
from
the
annoyance
of
having
to
cross
the
courtyards
in
open
day
in
order
to
follow
his
illustrious
companion
to
la
valliere
s
apartments
in
the
meantime
the
king
s
anger
momentarily
increased
he
made
two
or
three
steps
towards
the
door
as
if
to
leave
the
room
but
returned
the
young
girl
did
not
however
raise
her
head
although
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
might
have
warned
her
that
her
lover
was
leaving
her
he
drew
himself
up
for
a
moment
before
her
with
his
arms
crossed
for
the
last
time
mademoiselle
he
said
will
you
speak
will
you
assign
a
reason
for
this
change
this
fickleness
for
this
caprice
what
can
i
say
murmured
la
valliere
do
you
not
see
sire
that
i
am
completely
overwhelmed
at
this
moment
that
i
have
no
power
of
will
or
thought
or
speech
is
it
so
difficult
then
to
speak
the
truth
you
could
have
told
me
the
whole
truth
in
fewer
words
than
those
in
which
you
have
expressed
but
the
truth
about
what
sire
about
la
valliere
was
just
on
the
point
of
revealing
the
truth
to
the
king
her
arms
made
a
sudden
movement
as
if
they
were
about
to
open
but
her
lips
remained
silent
and
her
hands
again
fell
listlessly
by
her
side
the
poor
girl
had
not
yet
endured
sufficient
unhappiness
to
risk
the
necessary
revelation
i
know
nothing
she
stammered
out
oh
exclaimed
the
king
this
is
no
longer
mere
coquetry
or
caprice
it
is
and
this
time
nothing
could
restrain
him
the
impulse
of
his
heart
was
not
sufficient
to
induce
him
to
turn
back
and
he
darted
out
of
the
room
with
a
gesture
full
of
despair
followed
him
wishing
for
nothing
better
than
to
quit
the
place
louis
xiv
did
not
pause
until
he
reached
the
staircase
and
grasping
the
balustrade
said
you
see
how
shamefully
i
have
been
how
sire
inquired
the
favorite
de
guiche
fought
on
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
s
account
and
this
bragelonne
oh
she
still
loves
him
i
vow
to
you
that
if
in
three
days
from
now
there
were
to
remain
but
an
atom
of
affection
for
her
in
my
heart
i
should
die
from
very
and
the
king
resumed
his
way
to
his
own
apartments
i
told
your
majesty
how
it
would
be
murmured
continuing
to
follow
the
king
and
timidly
glancing
up
at
the
different
windows
unfortunately
their
return
was
not
like
their
arrival
unobserved
a
curtain
was
suddenly
drawn
aside
madame
was
behind
it
she
had
seen
the
king
leave
the
apartments
of
the
maids
of
honor
and
as
soon
as
she
observed
that
his
majesty
had
passed
she
left
her
own
apartments
with
hurried
steps
and
ran
up
the
staircase
that
led
to
the
room
the
king
had
just
left
chapter
xxv
despair
as
soon
as
the
king
was
gone
la
valliere
raised
herself
from
the
ground
and
stretched
out
her
arms
as
if
to
follow
and
detain
him
but
when
having
violently
closed
the
door
the
sound
of
his
retreating
footsteps
could
be
heard
in
the
distance
she
had
hardly
sufficient
strength
left
to
totter
towards
and
fall
at
the
foot
of
her
crucifix
there
she
remained
absorbed
and
overwhelmed
by
her
grief
forgetful
and
indifferent
to
everything
but
her
profound
sorrow
a
grief
she
only
vaguely
realized
as
though
by
instinct
in
the
midst
of
this
wild
tumult
of
thoughts
la
valliere
heard
her
door
open
again
she
started
and
turned
round
thinking
it
was
the
king
who
had
returned
she
was
deceived
however
for
it
was
madame
who
appeared
at
the
door
what
did
she
now
care
for
madame
again
she
sank
down
her
head
supported
by
her
chair
it
was
madame
agitated
angry
and
threatening
but
what
was
that
to
her
mademoiselle
said
the
princess
standing
before
la
valliere
this
is
very
fine
i
admit
to
kneel
and
pray
and
make
a
pretense
of
being
religious
but
however
submissive
you
may
be
in
your
address
to
heaven
it
is
desirable
that
you
should
pay
some
little
attention
to
the
wishes
of
those
who
reign
and
rule
here
la
valliere
raised
her
head
painfully
in
token
of
respect
not
long
since
continued
madame
a
certain
recommendation
was
addressed
to
you
i
la
valliere
s
fixed
and
wild
gaze
showed
how
complete
her
forgetfulness
or
ignorance
was
the
queen
recommended
you
continued
madame
to
conduct
yourself
in
such
a
manner
that
no
one
could
be
justified
in
spreading
any
reports
about
la
valliere
darted
an
inquiring
look
towards
her
i
will
not
continued
madame
allow
my
household
which
is
that
of
the
first
princess
of
the
blood
to
set
an
evil
example
to
the
court
you
would
be
the
cause
of
such
an
example
i
beg
you
to
understand
therefore
in
the
absence
of
any
witness
of
your
shame
for
i
do
not
wish
to
humiliate
you
that
you
are
from
this
moment
at
perfect
liberty
to
leave
and
that
you
can
return
to
your
mother
at
la
valliere
could
not
sink
lower
nor
could
she
suffer
more
than
she
had
already
suffered
her
countenance
did
not
even
change
but
she
remained
kneeling
with
her
hands
clasped
like
the
figure
of
the
magdalen
did
you
hear
me
said
madame
a
shiver
which
passed
through
her
whole
frame
was
la
valliere
s
only
reply
and
as
the
victim
gave
no
other
signs
of
life
madame
left
the
room
and
then
her
very
respiration
suspended
and
her
blood
almost
congealed
as
it
were
in
her
veins
la
valliere
by
degrees
felt
that
the
pulsation
of
her
wrists
her
neck
and
temples
began
to
throb
more
and
more
painfully
these
pulsations
as
they
gradually
increased
soon
changed
into
a
species
of
brain
fever
and
in
her
temporary
delirium
she
saw
the
figures
of
her
friends
contending
with
her
enemies
floating
before
her
vision
she
heard
too
mingled
together
in
her
deafened
ears
words
of
menace
and
words
of
fond
affection
she
seemed
raised
out
of
her
existence
as
though
it
were
upon
the
wings
of
a
mighty
tempest
and
in
the
dim
horizon
of
the
path
along
which
her
delirium
hurried
her
she
saw
the
stone
which
covered
her
tomb
upraised
and
the
grim
appalling
texture
of
eternal
night
revealed
to
her
distracted
gaze
but
the
horror
of
the
dream
which
possessed
her
senses
faded
away
and
she
was
again
restored
to
the
habitual
resignation
of
her
character
a
ray
of
hope
penetrated
her
heart
as
a
ray
of
sunlight
streams
into
the
dungeon
of
some
unhappy
captive
her
mind
reverted
to
the
journey
from
fontainebleau
she
saw
the
king
riding
beside
her
carriage
telling
her
that
he
loved
her
asking
for
her
love
in
return
requiring
her
to
swear
and
himself
to
swear
too
that
never
should
an
evening
pass
by
if
ever
a
misunderstanding
were
to
arise
between
them
without
a
visit
a
letter
a
sign
of
some
kind
being
sent
to
replace
the
troubled
anxiety
of
the
evening
with
the
calm
repose
of
the
night
it
was
the
king
who
had
suggested
that
who
had
imposed
a
promise
on
her
and
who
had
sworn
to
it
himself
it
was
impossible
therefore
she
reasoned
that
the
king
should
fail
in
keeping
the
promise
which
he
had
himself
exacted
from
her
unless
indeed
louis
was
a
despot
who
enforced
love
as
he
enforced
obedience
unless
too
the
king
were
so
indifferent
that
the
first
obstacle
in
his
way
was
sufficient
to
arrest
his
further
progress
the
king
that
kind
protector
who
by
a
word
a
single
word
could
relieve
her
distress
of
mind
the
king
even
joined
her
persecutors
oh
his
anger
could
not
possibly
last
now
that
he
was
alone
he
would
be
suffering
all
that
she
herself
was
a
prey
to
but
he
was
not
tied
hand
and
foot
as
she
was
he
could
act
could
move
about
could
come
to
her
while
she
could
do
nothing
but
wait
and
the
poor
girl
waited
and
waited
with
breathless
anxiety
for
she
could
not
believe
it
possible
that
the
king
would
not
come
it
was
now
about
ten
he
would
either
come
to
her
or
write
to
her
or
send
some
kind
word
by
de
if
he
were
to
come
oh
how
she
would
fly
to
meet
him
how
she
would
thrust
aside
that
excess
of
delicacy
which
she
now
discovered
was
misunderstood
how
eagerly
she
would
explain
it
is
not
i
who
do
not
love
you
it
is
the
fault
of
others
who
will
not
allow
me
to
love
and
then
it
must
be
confessed
that
she
reflected
upon
it
and
also
the
more
she
reflected
louis
appeared
to
her
to
be
less
guilty
in
fact
he
was
ignorant
of
everything
what
must
he
have
thought
of
the
obstinacy
with
which
she
remained
silent
impatient
and
irritable
as
the
king
was
known
to
be
it
was
extraordinary
that
he
had
been
able
to
preserve
his
temper
so
long
and
yet
had
it
been
her
own
case
she
undoubtedly
would
not
have
acted
in
such
a
manner
she
would
have
understood
have
guessed
everything
yes
but
she
was
nothing
but
a
poor
girl
and
not
a
great
and
powerful
monarch
oh
if
he
would
but
come
if
he
would
but
come
how
eagerly
she
would
forgive
him
for
all
he
had
just
made
her
suffer
how
much
more
tenderly
she
would
love
him
because
she
had
so
cruelly
suffered
and
so
she
sat
with
her
head
bent
forward
in
eager
expectation
towards
the
door
her
lips
slightly
parted
as
if
and
heaven
forgive
her
for
the
mental
exclamation
they
were
awaiting
the
kiss
which
the
king
s
lips
had
in
the
morning
so
sweetly
indicated
when
he
pronounced
the
word
if
the
king
did
not
come
at
least
he
would
write
it
was
a
second
chance
a
chance
less
delightful
certainly
than
the
other
but
which
would
show
an
affection
just
as
strong
only
more
timid
in
its
nature
oh
how
she
would
devour
his
letter
how
eager
she
would
be
to
answer
it
and
when
the
messenger
who
had
brought
it
had
left
her
how
she
would
kiss
it
read
it
over
and
over
again
press
to
her
heart
the
lucky
paper
which
would
have
brought
her
ease
of
mind
tranquillity
and
perfect
happiness
at
all
events
if
the
king
did
not
come
if
the
king
did
not
write
he
could
not
do
otherwise
than
send
or
could
not
do
otherwise
than
come
of
his
own
accord
even
if
it
were
a
third
person
how
openly
she
would
speak
to
him
the
royal
presence
would
not
be
there
to
freeze
her
words
upon
her
tongue
and
then
no
suspicious
feeling
would
remain
a
moment
longer
in
the
king
s
heart
everything
with
la
valliere
heart
and
look
body
and
mind
was
concentrated
in
eager
expectation
she
said
to
herself
that
there
was
an
hour
left
in
which
to
indulge
hope
that
until
midnight
struck
the
king
might
come
or
write
or
send
that
at
midnight
only
would
every
expectation
vanish
every
hope
be
lost
whenever
she
heard
any
stir
in
the
palace
the
poor
girl
fancied
she
was
the
cause
of
it
whenever
she
heard
any
one
pass
in
the
courtyard
below
she
imagined
they
were
messengers
of
the
king
coming
to
her
eleven
o
clock
struck
then
a
eleven
then
the
minutes
dragged
slowly
on
in
this
anxiety
and
yet
they
seemed
to
pass
too
quickly
and
now
it
struck
a
quarter
to
twelve
midnight
midnight
was
near
the
last
the
final
hope
that
remained
with
the
last
stroke
of
the
clock
the
last
ray
of
light
seemed
to
fade
away
and
with
the
last
ray
faded
her
final
hope
and
so
the
king
himself
had
deceived
her
it
was
he
who
had
been
the
first
to
fail
in
keeping
the
oath
which
he
had
sworn
that
very
day
twelve
hours
only
between
his
oath
and
his
perjured
vow
it
was
not
long
alas
to
have
preserved
the
illusion
and
so
not
only
did
the
king
not
love
her
but
he
despised
her
whom
every
one
he
despised
her
to
the
extent
even
of
abandoning
her
to
the
shame
of
an
expulsion
which
was
equivalent
to
having
an
ignominious
sentence
passed
on
her
and
yet
it
was
he
the
king
himself
who
was
the
first
cause
of
this
ignominy
a
bitter
smile
the
only
symptom
of
anger
which
during
this
long
conflict
had
passed
across
the
angelic
face
appeared
upon
her
lips
what
in
fact
now
remained
on
earth
for
her
after
the
king
was
lost
to
her
nothing
but
heaven
still
remained
and
her
thoughts
flew
thither
she
prayed
that
the
proper
course
for
her
to
follow
might
be
suggested
it
is
from
heaven
she
thought
that
i
expect
everything
it
is
from
heaven
i
ought
to
expect
and
she
looked
at
her
crucifix
with
a
devotion
full
of
tender
love
there
she
said
hangs
before
me
a
master
who
never
forgets
and
never
abandons
those
who
neither
forget
nor
abandon
him
it
is
to
him
alone
that
we
must
sacrifice
and
thereupon
could
any
one
have
gazed
into
the
recesses
of
that
chamber
they
would
have
seen
the
poor
despairing
girl
adopt
a
final
resolution
and
determine
upon
one
last
plan
in
her
mind
then
as
her
knees
were
no
longer
able
to
support
her
she
gradually
sank
down
upon
the
and
with
her
head
pressed
against
the
wooden
cross
her
eyes
fixed
and
her
respiration
short
and
quick
she
watched
for
the
earliest
rays
of
approaching
daylight
at
two
o
clock
in
the
morning
she
was
still
in
the
same
bewilderment
of
mind
or
rather
the
same
ecstasy
of
feeling
her
thoughts
had
almost
ceased
to
hold
communion
with
things
of
the
world
and
when
she
saw
the
pale
violet
tints
of
early
dawn
visible
over
the
roofs
of
the
palace
and
vaguely
revealing
the
outlines
of
the
ivory
crucifix
which
she
held
embraced
she
rose
from
the
ground
with
a
strength
kissed
the
feet
of
the
divine
martyr
descended
the
staircase
leading
from
the
room
and
wrapped
herself
from
head
to
foot
in
a
mantle
as
she
went
along
she
reached
the
wicket
at
the
very
moment
the
guard
of
the
musketeers
opened
the
gate
to
admit
the
first
belonging
to
one
of
the
swiss
regiments
and
then
gliding
behind
the
soldiers
she
reached
the
street
before
the
officer
in
command
of
the
patrol
had
even
thought
of
asking
who
the
young
girl
was
who
was
making
her
escape
from
the
palace
at
so
early
an
hour
chapter
xxvi
the
flight
la
valliere
followed
the
patrol
as
it
left
the
courtyard
the
patrol
bent
its
steps
towards
the
right
by
the
rue
honore
and
mechanically
la
valliere
turned
to
the
left
her
resolution
was
taken
her
determination
fixed
she
wished
to
betake
herself
to
the
convent
of
the
carmelites
at
chaillot
the
superior
of
which
enjoyed
a
reputation
for
severity
which
made
the
people
of
the
court
tremble
la
valliere
had
never
seen
paris
she
had
never
gone
out
on
foot
and
so
would
have
been
unable
to
find
her
way
even
had
she
been
in
a
calmer
frame
of
mind
than
was
then
the
case
and
this
may
explain
why
she
ascended
instead
of
descending
the
rue
honore
her
only
thought
was
to
get
away
from
the
palais
royal
and
this
she
was
doing
she
had
heard
it
said
that
chaillot
looked
out
upon
the
seine
and
she
accordingly
directed
her
steps
towards
the
seine
she
took
the
rue
de
coq
and
not
being
able
to
cross
the
louvre
bore
towards
the
church
of
saint
germain
l
auxerrois
proceeding
along
the
site
of
the
colonnade
which
was
subsequently
built
there
by
perrault
in
a
very
short
time
she
reached
the
quays
her
steps
were
rapid
and
agitated
she
scarcely
felt
the
weakness
which
reminded
her
of
having
sprained
her
foot
when
very
young
and
which
obliged
her
to
limp
slightly
at
any
other
hour
in
the
day
her
countenance
would
have
awakened
the
suspicions
of
the
least
attracted
the
attention
of
the
most
indifferent
but
at
two
in
the
morning
the
streets
of
paris
are
almost
if
not
quite
deserted
and
scarcely
is
any
one
to
be
seen
but
the
artisan
on
his
way
to
earn
his
daily
bread
or
the
roistering
idlers
of
the
streets
who
are
returning
to
their
homes
after
a
night
of
riot
and
debauchery
for
the
former
the
day
was
beginning
and
for
the
latter
it
was
just
closing
la
valliere
was
afraid
of
both
faces
in
which
her
ignorance
of
parisian
types
did
not
permit
her
to
distinguish
the
type
of
probity
from
that
of
dishonesty
the
appearance
of
misery
alarmed
her
and
all
she
met
seemed
either
vile
or
miserable
her
dress
which
was
the
same
she
had
worn
during
the
previous
evening
was
elegant
even
in
its
careless
disorder
for
it
was
the
one
in
which
she
had
presented
herself
to
the
and
moreover
when
she
drew
aside
the
mantle
which
covered
her
face
in
order
to
enable
her
to
see
the
way
she
was
going
her
pallor
and
her
beautiful
eyes
spoke
an
unknown
language
to
the
men
she
met
and
unconsciously
the
poor
fugitive
seemed
to
invite
the
brutal
remarks
of
the
one
class
or
to
appeal
to
the
compassion
of
the
other
la
valliere
still
walked
on
in
the
same
way
breathless
and
hurried
until
she
reached
the
top
of
the
place
de
greve
she
stopped
from
time
to
time
placed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
leaned
against
a
wall
until
she
could
breathe
freely
again
and
then
continued
on
her
course
more
rapidly
than
before
on
reaching
the
place
de
greve
la
valliere
suddenly
came
upon
a
group
of
three
drunken
men
reeling
and
staggering
along
who
were
just
leaving
a
boat
which
they
had
made
fast
to
the
quay
the
boat
was
freighted
with
wines
and
it
was
apparent
that
they
had
done
ample
justice
to
the
merchandise
they
were
celebrating
their
convivial
exploits
in
three
different
keys
when
suddenly
as
they
reached
the
end
of
the
railing
leading
down
to
the
quay
they
found
an
obstacle
in
their
path
in
the
shape
of
this
young
girl
la
valliere
stopped
while
they
on
their
part
at
the
appearance
of
the
young
girl
dressed
in
court
costume
also
halted
and
seizing
each
other
by
the
hand
they
surrounded
la
valliere
singing
oh
all
ye
weary
wights
who
mope
alone
come
drink
and
sing
and
laugh
round
venus
la
valliere
at
once
understood
that
the
men
were
insulting
her
and
wished
to
prevent
her
passing
she
tried
to
do
so
several
times
but
her
efforts
were
useless
her
limbs
failed
her
she
felt
she
was
on
the
point
of
falling
and
uttered
a
cry
of
terror
at
the
same
moment
the
circle
which
surrounded
her
was
suddenly
broken
through
in
a
most
violent
manner
one
of
her
insulters
was
knocked
to
the
left
another
fell
rolling
over
and
over
to
the
right
close
to
the
water
s
edge
while
the
third
could
hardly
keep
his
feet
an
officer
of
the
musketeers
stood
face
to
face
with
the
young
girl
with
threatening
brow
and
hand
raised
to
carry
out
his
threat
the
drunken
fellows
at
sight
of
the
uniform
made
their
escape
with
what
speed
their
staggering
limbs
could
lend
them
all
the
more
eagerly
for
the
proof
of
strength
which
the
wearer
of
the
uniform
had
just
afforded
them
is
it
possible
exclaimed
the
musketeer
that
it
can
be
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
la
valliere
bewildered
by
what
had
just
happened
and
confounded
by
hearing
her
name
pronounced
looked
up
and
recognized
d
artagnan
oh
d
artagnan
it
is
indeed
i
and
at
the
same
moment
she
seized
his
arm
you
will
protect
me
will
you
not
she
added
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
most
certainly
i
will
protect
you
but
in
heaven
s
name
where
are
you
going
at
this
hour
i
am
going
to
you
are
going
to
chaillot
by
way
of
la
rapee
why
mademoiselle
you
are
turning
your
back
upon
in
that
case
monsieur
be
kind
enough
to
put
me
in
the
right
way
and
to
go
with
me
a
short
most
but
how
does
it
happen
that
i
have
found
you
here
by
what
merciful
intervention
were
you
sent
to
my
assistance
i
almost
seem
to
be
dreaming
or
to
be
losing
my
i
happened
to
be
here
mademoiselle
because
i
have
a
house
in
the
place
de
greve
at
the
sign
of
the
the
rent
of
which
i
went
to
receive
yesterday
and
where
i
in
fact
passed
the
night
and
i
also
wished
to
be
at
the
palace
early
for
the
purposes
of
inspecting
my
thank
you
said
la
valliere
that
is
what
was
doing
said
d
artagnan
to
himself
but
what
is
doing
and
why
is
she
going
to
chaillot
at
such
an
hour
and
he
offered
her
his
arm
which
she
took
and
began
to
walk
with
increased
precipitation
which
however
her
weakness
d
artagnan
perceived
it
and
proposed
to
la
valliere
that
she
should
take
a
little
rest
which
she
refused
you
are
ignorant
perhaps
where
chaillot
is
inquired
d
artagnan
quite
it
is
a
great
that
matters
very
it
is
at
least
a
i
can
walk
d
artagnan
did
not
reply
he
could
tell
merely
by
the
tone
of
a
voice
when
a
resolution
was
real
or
not
he
rather
bore
along
rather
than
accompanied
la
valliere
until
they
perceived
the
elevated
ground
of
chaillot
what
house
are
you
going
to
mademoiselle
inquired
d
artagnan
to
the
carmelites
to
the
carmelites
repeated
d
artagnan
in
amazement
yes
and
since
heaven
has
directed
you
towards
me
to
give
me
your
support
on
my
road
accept
both
my
thanks
and
my
to
the
carmelites
your
adieux
are
you
going
to
become
a
nun
exclaimed
d
artagnan
yes
what
you
there
was
in
this
you
which
we
have
marked
by
three
notes
of
exclamation
in
order
to
render
it
as
expressive
as
possible
there
was
we
repeat
in
this
you
a
complete
poem
it
recalled
to
la
valliere
her
old
recollections
of
blois
and
her
new
recollections
of
fontainebleau
it
said
to
her
who
might
be
happy
with
raoul
who
might
be
powerful
with
louis
about
to
become
a
nun
yes
monsieur
she
said
i
am
going
to
devote
myself
to
the
service
of
heaven
and
to
renounce
the
world
but
are
you
not
mistaken
with
regard
to
your
vocation
are
you
not
mistaken
in
supposing
it
to
be
the
will
of
heaven
no
since
heaven
has
been
pleased
to
throw
you
in
my
way
had
it
not
been
for
you
i
should
certainly
have
sunk
from
fatigue
on
the
road
and
since
heaven
i
repeat
has
thrown
you
in
my
way
it
is
because
it
has
willed
that
i
should
carry
out
my
oh
said
d
artagnan
doubtingly
that
is
a
rather
subtle
distinction
i
whatever
it
may
be
returned
the
young
girl
i
have
acquainted
you
with
the
steps
i
have
taken
and
with
my
fixed
resolution
and
now
i
have
one
last
favor
to
ask
of
you
even
while
i
return
you
my
thanks
the
king
is
entirely
ignorant
of
my
flight
from
the
palais
royal
and
is
ignorant
also
of
what
i
am
about
to
the
king
ignorant
you
say
exclaimed
d
artagnan
take
care
mademoiselle
you
are
not
aware
of
what
you
are
doing
no
one
ought
to
do
anything
with
which
the
king
is
unacquainted
especially
those
who
belong
to
the
i
no
longer
belong
to
the
court
d
artagnan
looked
at
the
young
girl
with
increasing
astonishment
do
not
be
uneasy
monsieur
she
continued
i
have
well
calculated
everything
and
were
it
not
so
it
would
now
be
too
late
to
reconsider
my
resolution
all
is
well
mademoiselle
what
do
you
wish
me
to
do
in
the
name
of
that
sympathy
which
misfortune
inspires
by
your
generous
feeling
and
by
your
honor
as
a
gentleman
i
entreat
you
to
promise
me
one
name
swear
to
me
monsieur
d
artagnan
that
you
will
not
tell
the
king
that
you
have
seen
me
and
that
i
am
at
the
i
will
not
swear
that
said
d
artagnan
shaking
his
head
why
because
i
know
the
king
i
know
you
i
know
myself
even
nay
the
whole
human
race
too
well
no
no
i
will
not
swear
that
in
that
case
cried
la
valliere
with
an
energy
of
which
one
would
hardly
have
thought
her
capable
instead
of
the
blessing
which
i
should
have
implored
for
you
until
my
dying
day
i
will
invoke
a
curse
for
you
are
rendering
me
the
most
miserable
creature
that
ever
we
have
already
observed
that
d
artagnan
could
easily
recognize
the
accents
of
truth
and
sincerity
and
he
could
not
resist
this
last
appeal
he
saw
by
her
face
how
bitterly
she
suffered
from
a
feeling
of
degradation
he
remarked
her
trembling
limbs
how
her
whole
slight
and
delicate
frame
was
violently
agitated
by
some
internal
struggle
and
clearly
perceived
that
resistance
might
be
fatal
i
will
do
as
you
wish
then
he
said
be
satisfied
mademoiselle
i
will
say
nothing
to
the
oh
thanks
thanks
exclaimed
la
valliere
you
are
the
most
generous
man
and
in
her
extreme
delight
she
seized
hold
of
d
artagnan
s
hands
and
pressed
them
between
her
own
d
artagnan
who
felt
himself
quite
overcome
said
this
is
touching
upon
my
word
she
begins
where
others
leave
and
la
valliere
who
in
the
bitterness
of
her
distress
had
sunk
upon
the
ground
rose
and
walked
towards
the
convent
of
the
carmelites
which
could
now
in
the
dawning
light
be
perceived
just
before
them
d
artagnan
followed
her
at
a
distance
the
was
she
glided
in
like
a
shadow
and
thanking
d
artagnan
by
a
parting
gesture
disappeared
from
his
sight
when
d
artagnan
found
himself
quite
alone
he
reflected
very
profoundly
upon
what
had
just
taken
place
upon
my
word
he
said
this
looks
very
much
like
what
is
called
a
false
position
to
keep
such
a
secret
as
that
is
to
keep
a
burning
coal
in
one
s
and
trust
that
it
may
not
burn
the
stuff
and
yet
not
to
keep
it
when
i
have
sworn
to
do
so
is
dishonorable
it
generally
happens
that
some
bright
idea
or
other
occurs
to
me
as
i
am
going
along
but
i
am
very
much
mistaken
if
i
shall
not
now
have
to
go
a
long
way
in
order
to
find
the
solution
of
this
affair
yes
but
which
way
to
go
oh
towards
paris
of
course
that
is
the
best
way
after
all
only
one
must
make
haste
and
in
order
to
make
haste
four
legs
are
better
than
two
and
i
unhappily
only
have
two
a
horse
a
horse
as
i
heard
them
say
at
the
theatre
in
london
my
kingdom
for
a
horse
and
now
i
think
of
it
it
need
not
cost
me
so
much
as
that
for
at
the
barriere
de
la
conference
there
is
a
guard
of
musketeers
and
instead
of
the
one
horse
i
need
i
shall
find
ten
so
in
pursuance
of
this
resolution
which
he
adopted
with
his
usual
rapidity
d
artagnan
immediately
turned
his
back
upon
the
heights
of
chaillot
reached
the
took
the
fastest
horse
he
could
find
there
and
was
at
the
palace
in
less
than
ten
minutes
it
was
striking
five
as
he
reached
the
palais
royal
the
king
he
was
told
had
gone
to
bed
at
his
usual
hour
having
been
long
engaged
with
colbert
and
in
all
probability
was
still
sound
asleep
come
said
d
artagnan
she
spoke
the
truth
the
king
is
ignorant
of
everything
if
he
only
knew
of
what
has
happened
the
palais
royal
by
this
time
would
be
turned
upside
chapter
xxvii
showing
how
louis
on
his
part
had
passed
the
time
from
ten
to
twelve
at
night
when
the
king
left
the
apartments
of
the
maids
of
honor
he
found
colbert
awaiting
him
to
take
directions
for
the
next
day
s
ceremony
as
the
king
was
then
to
receive
the
dutch
and
spanish
ambassadors
louis
xiv
had
serious
causes
of
dissatisfaction
with
the
dutch
the
states
had
already
been
guilty
of
many
mean
shifts
and
evasions
with
france
and
without
perceiving
or
without
caring
about
the
chances
of
a
rupture
they
again
abandoned
the
alliance
with
his
most
christian
majesty
for
the
purpose
of
entering
into
all
kinds
of
plots
with
spain
louis
xiv
at
his
accession
that
is
to
say
at
the
death
of
cardinal
mazarin
had
found
this
political
question
roughly
sketched
out
the
solution
was
difficult
for
a
young
man
but
as
at
that
time
the
king
represented
the
whole
nation
anything
that
the
head
resolved
upon
the
body
would
be
found
ready
to
carry
out
any
sudden
impulse
of
anger
the
reaction
of
young
hot
blood
upon
the
brain
would
be
quite
sufficient
to
change
an
old
form
of
policy
and
create
another
system
altogether
the
part
that
diplomatists
had
to
play
in
those
days
was
that
of
arranging
among
themselves
the
different
which
their
sovereign
masters
might
wish
to
effect
louis
was
not
in
that
calm
frame
of
mind
which
was
necessary
to
enable
him
to
determine
on
a
wise
course
of
policy
still
much
agitated
from
the
quarrel
he
had
just
had
with
la
valliere
he
walked
hastily
into
his
cabinet
dimly
desirous
of
finding
an
opportunity
of
producing
an
explosion
after
he
had
controlled
himself
for
so
long
a
time
colbert
as
he
saw
the
king
enter
knew
the
position
of
affairs
at
a
glance
understood
the
king
s
intentions
and
resolved
therefore
to
maneuver
a
little
when
louis
requested
to
be
informed
what
it
would
be
necessary
to
say
on
the
morrow
colbert
began
by
expressing
his
surprise
that
his
majesty
had
not
been
properly
informed
by
fouquet
m
fouquet
he
said
is
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
whole
of
this
dutch
affair
he
received
the
dispatches
himself
the
king
who
was
accustomed
to
hear
colbert
speak
in
not
terms
of
fouquet
allowed
this
remark
to
pass
unanswered
and
merely
listened
colbert
noticed
the
effect
it
had
produced
and
hastened
to
back
out
saying
that
fouquet
was
not
on
all
occasions
as
blamable
as
at
the
first
glance
might
seem
to
be
the
case
inasmuch
as
at
that
moment
he
was
greatly
occupied
the
king
looked
up
what
do
you
allude
to
he
said
sire
men
are
but
men
and
fouquet
has
his
defects
as
well
as
his
great
ah
defects
who
is
without
them
colbert
your
majesty
hardly
said
colbert
boldly
for
he
knew
how
to
convey
a
good
deal
of
flattery
in
a
light
amount
of
blame
like
the
arrow
which
cleaves
the
air
notwithstanding
its
weight
thanks
to
the
light
feathers
which
bear
it
up
the
king
smiled
what
defect
has
fouquet
then
he
said
still
the
same
sire
it
is
said
he
is
in
in
love
with
whom
i
am
not
quite
sure
sire
i
have
very
little
to
do
with
matters
of
at
all
events
you
know
since
you
speak
of
i
have
heard
a
name
whose
i
can
not
now
remember
whose
but
i
think
it
is
one
of
madame
s
maids
of
the
king
started
you
know
more
than
you
like
to
say
colbert
he
murmured
i
assure
you
no
at
all
events
madame
s
maids
of
honor
are
all
known
and
in
mentioning
their
names
to
you
you
will
perhaps
recollect
the
one
you
allude
no
at
least
it
would
be
useless
sire
whenever
the
name
of
any
lady
who
runs
the
risk
of
being
compromised
is
concerned
my
memory
is
like
a
coffer
of
bronze
the
key
of
which
i
have
a
dark
cloud
seemed
to
pass
over
the
mind
as
well
as
across
the
face
of
the
king
then
wishing
to
appear
as
if
he
were
perfect
master
of
himself
and
his
feelings
he
said
and
now
for
the
affair
concerning
in
the
first
place
sire
at
what
hour
will
your
majesty
receive
the
ambassadors
early
in
the
eleven
o
clock
that
is
too
late
say
nine
o
that
will
be
too
early
for
friends
that
would
be
a
matter
of
no
importance
one
does
what
one
likes
with
one
s
friends
but
for
one
s
enemies
in
that
case
nothing
could
be
better
than
if
they
to
feel
hurt
i
should
not
be
sorry
i
confess
to
have
to
finish
altogether
with
these
who
annoy
me
with
their
it
shall
be
precisely
as
your
majesty
desires
at
nine
o
clock
therefore
i
will
give
the
necessary
orders
is
it
to
be
a
formal
audience
no
i
wish
to
have
an
explanation
with
them
and
not
to
embitter
matters
as
is
always
the
case
when
many
persons
are
present
but
at
the
same
time
i
wish
to
clear
up
everything
with
them
in
order
not
to
have
to
begin
over
your
majesty
will
inform
me
of
the
persons
whom
you
wish
to
be
present
at
the
i
will
draw
out
a
list
let
us
speak
of
the
ambassadors
what
do
they
want
allies
with
spain
they
gain
nothing
allies
with
france
they
lose
how
is
that
allied
with
spain
they
see
themselves
bounded
and
protected
by
the
possessions
of
their
allies
they
can
not
touch
them
however
anxious
they
may
be
to
do
so
from
antwerp
to
rotterdam
is
but
a
step
and
that
by
the
way
of
the
scheldt
and
the
meuse
if
they
wish
to
make
a
bite
at
the
spanish
cake
you
sire
the
of
the
king
of
spain
could
with
your
cavalry
sweep
the
earth
from
your
dominions
to
brussels
in
a
couple
of
days
their
design
is
therefore
only
to
quarrel
so
far
with
you
and
only
to
make
you
suspect
spain
so
far
as
will
be
sufficient
to
induce
you
not
to
interfere
with
their
own
it
would
be
far
more
simple
i
should
imagine
replied
the
king
to
form
a
solid
alliance
with
me
by
means
of
which
i
should
gain
something
while
they
would
gain
not
so
for
if
by
chance
they
were
to
have
you
or
france
rather
as
a
boundary
your
majesty
is
not
an
agreeable
neighbor
young
ardent
warlike
the
king
of
france
might
inflict
some
serious
mischief
on
holland
especially
if
he
were
to
get
near
i
perfectly
understand
colbert
and
you
have
explained
it
very
clearly
but
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
the
conclusion
you
have
arrived
your
majesty
s
own
decisions
are
never
deficient
in
what
will
these
ambassadors
say
to
me
they
will
tell
your
majesty
that
they
are
ardently
desirous
of
forming
an
alliance
with
you
which
will
be
a
falsehood
they
will
tell
spain
that
the
three
powers
ought
to
unite
so
as
to
check
the
prosperity
of
england
and
that
will
equally
be
a
falsehood
for
at
present
the
natural
ally
of
your
majesty
is
england
who
has
ships
while
we
have
none
england
who
can
counteract
dutch
influence
in
india
england
in
fact
a
monarchical
country
to
which
your
majesty
is
attached
by
ties
of
good
but
how
would
you
answer
i
should
answer
sire
with
the
greatest
possible
moderation
of
tone
that
the
disposition
of
holland
does
not
seem
friendly
towards
the
court
of
france
that
the
symptoms
of
public
feeling
among
the
dutch
are
alarming
as
regards
your
majesty
that
certain
medals
have
been
struck
with
insulting
towards
me
exclaimed
the
young
king
excitedly
oh
no
sire
no
insulting
is
not
the
word
i
was
mistaken
i
ought
to
have
said
immeasurably
flattering
to
the
oh
if
that
be
so
the
pride
of
the
dutch
is
a
matter
of
indifference
to
me
said
the
king
sighing
your
majesty
is
right
a
thousand
times
right
however
it
is
never
a
mistake
in
politics
your
majesty
knows
better
than
myself
to
exaggerate
a
little
in
order
to
obtain
a
concession
in
your
own
favor
if
your
majesty
were
to
complain
as
if
your
susceptibility
were
offended
you
would
stand
in
a
far
higher
position
with
what
are
these
medals
you
speak
of
inquired
louis
for
if
i
allude
to
them
i
ought
to
know
what
to
upon
my
word
sire
i
can
not
very
well
tell
you
some
overweeningly
conceited
device
that
is
the
sense
of
it
the
words
have
little
to
do
with
the
thing
very
good
i
will
mention
the
word
medal
and
they
can
understand
it
if
they
oh
they
will
understand
without
any
difficulty
your
majesty
can
also
slip
in
a
few
words
about
certain
pamphlets
which
are
being
never
pamphlets
befoul
those
who
write
them
much
more
than
those
against
whom
they
are
written
colbert
i
thank
you
you
can
leave
now
do
not
forget
the
hour
i
have
fixed
and
be
there
sire
i
await
your
majesty
s
true
returned
the
king
and
he
began
to
meditate
he
had
not
thought
of
the
list
in
the
least
the
clock
struck
eleven
the
king
s
face
revealed
a
violent
conflict
between
pride
and
love
the
political
conversation
had
dispelled
a
good
deal
of
the
irritation
which
louis
had
felt
and
la
valliere
s
pale
worn
features
in
his
imagination
spoke
a
very
different
language
from
that
of
the
dutch
medals
or
the
batavian
pamphlets
he
sat
for
ten
minutes
debating
within
himself
whether
he
should
or
should
not
return
to
la
valliere
but
colbert
having
with
some
urgency
respectfully
requested
that
the
list
might
be
furnished
him
the
king
was
ashamed
to
be
thinking
of
mere
matters
of
affection
where
important
state
affairs
required
his
attention
he
therefore
dictated
the
the
queen
madame
madame
de
motteville
madame
de
chatillon
madame
de
navailles
and
for
the
men
le
prince
de
gramont
de
manicamp
de
and
the
officers
on
duty
the
ministers
asked
colbert
as
a
matter
of
course
and
the
secretaries
sire
i
will
leave
at
once
in
order
to
get
everything
prepared
the
orders
will
be
at
the
different
residences
say
rather
replied
louis
mournfully
as
the
clock
struck
twelve
it
was
the
very
hour
when
poor
la
valliere
was
almost
dying
from
anguish
and
bitter
suffering
the
king
s
attendants
entered
it
being
the
hour
of
his
retirement
to
his
chamber
the
queen
indeed
had
been
waiting
for
more
than
an
hour
louis
accordingly
retreated
to
his
bedroom
with
a
sigh
but
as
he
sighed
he
congratulated
himself
on
his
courage
and
applauded
himself
for
having
been
as
firm
in
love
as
in
affairs
of
state
chapter
xxviii
the
ambassadors
d
artagnan
had
with
very
few
exceptions
learned
almost
all
of
the
particulars
of
what
we
have
just
been
relating
for
among
his
friends
he
reckoned
all
the
useful
serviceable
people
in
the
royal
household
officious
attendants
who
were
proud
of
being
recognized
by
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
for
the
captain
s
influence
was
very
great
and
then
in
addition
to
any
ambitious
views
they
may
have
imagined
he
could
promote
they
were
proud
of
being
regarded
as
worth
being
spoken
to
by
a
man
as
brave
as
d
artagnan
in
this
manner
d
artagnan
learned
every
morning
what
he
had
not
been
able
either
to
see
or
to
ascertain
the
night
before
from
the
simple
fact
of
his
not
being
ubiquitous
so
that
with
the
information
he
had
been
able
by
his
own
means
to
pick
up
during
the
day
and
with
what
he
had
gathered
from
others
he
succeeded
in
making
up
a
bundle
of
weapons
which
he
was
in
the
prudent
habit
of
using
only
when
occasion
required
in
this
way
d
artagnan
s
two
eyes
rendered
him
the
same
service
as
the
hundred
eyes
of
argus
political
secrets
bedside
revelations
hints
or
scraps
of
conversation
dropped
by
the
courtiers
on
the
threshold
of
the
royal
in
this
way
d
artagnan
managed
to
ascertain
and
to
store
away
everything
in
the
vast
and
impenetrable
mausoleum
of
his
memory
by
the
side
of
those
royal
secrets
so
dearly
bought
and
faithfully
preserved
he
therefore
knew
of
the
king
s
interview
with
colbert
and
of
the
appointment
made
for
the
ambassadors
in
the
morning
and
consequently
that
the
question
of
the
medals
would
be
brought
up
for
debate
and
while
he
was
arranging
and
constructing
the
conversation
upon
a
few
chance
words
which
had
reached
his
ears
he
returned
to
his
post
in
the
royal
apartments
so
as
to
be
there
at
the
very
moment
the
king
awoke
it
happened
that
the
king
rose
very
early
proving
thereby
that
he
too
on
his
side
had
slept
but
indifferently
towards
seven
o
clock
he
his
door
very
gently
d
artagnan
was
at
his
post
his
majesty
was
pale
and
seemed
wearied
he
had
not
moreover
quite
finished
dressing
send
for
de
he
said
was
probably
awaiting
a
summons
for
the
messenger
when
he
reached
his
apartment
found
him
already
dressed
hastened
to
the
king
in
obedience
to
the
summons
a
moment
afterwards
the
king
and
passed
by
together
the
king
walking
first
d
artagnan
went
to
the
window
which
looked
out
upon
the
courtyard
he
had
no
need
to
put
himself
to
the
trouble
of
watching
in
what
direction
the
king
went
for
he
had
no
difficulty
in
guessing
beforehand
where
his
majesty
was
going
the
king
in
fact
bent
his
steps
towards
the
apartments
of
the
maids
of
honor
a
circumstance
which
in
no
way
astonished
d
artagnan
for
he
more
than
suspected
although
la
valliere
had
not
breathed
a
syllable
on
the
subject
that
the
king
had
some
kind
of
reparation
to
make
followed
him
as
he
had
done
the
previous
evening
rather
less
uneasy
in
his
mind
though
still
slightly
agitated
for
he
fervently
trusted
that
at
seven
o
clock
in
the
morning
there
might
be
only
himself
and
the
king
awake
amongst
the
august
guests
at
the
palace
d
artagnan
stood
at
the
window
careless
and
perfectly
calm
in
his
manner
one
could
almost
have
sworn
that
he
noticed
nothing
and
was
utterly
ignorant
who
were
these
two
hunters
after
adventures
passing
like
shadows
across
the
courtyard
wrapped
up
in
their
cloaks
and
yet
all
the
while
that
d
artagnan
appeared
not
to
be
looking
at
them
at
all
he
did
not
for
one
moment
lose
sight
of
them
and
while
he
whistled
that
old
march
of
the
musketeers
which
he
rarely
recalled
except
under
great
emergencies
he
conjectured
and
prophesied
how
terrible
would
be
the
storm
which
would
be
raised
on
the
king
s
return
in
fact
when
the
king
entered
la
valliere
s
apartment
and
found
the
room
empty
and
the
bed
untouched
he
began
to
be
alarmed
and
called
out
to
montalais
who
immediately
answered
the
summons
but
her
astonishment
was
equal
to
the
king
s
all
that
she
could
tell
his
majesty
was
that
she
had
fancied
she
had
heard
la
valliere
s
weeping
during
a
portion
of
the
night
but
knowing
that
his
majesty
had
paid
her
a
visit
she
had
not
dared
to
inquire
what
was
the
matter
but
inquired
the
king
where
do
you
suppose
she
is
gone
sire
replied
montalais
louise
is
of
a
very
sentimental
disposition
and
as
i
have
often
seen
her
rise
at
daybreak
in
order
to
go
out
into
the
garden
she
may
perhaps
be
there
this
appeared
probable
and
the
king
immediately
ran
down
the
staircase
in
search
of
the
fugitive
d
artagnan
saw
him
grow
very
pale
and
talking
in
an
excited
manner
with
his
companion
as
he
went
towards
the
gardens
following
him
out
of
breath
d
artagnan
did
not
stir
from
the
window
but
went
on
whistling
looking
as
if
he
saw
nothing
yet
seeing
everything
come
come
he
murmured
when
the
king
disappeared
his
majesty
s
passion
is
stronger
than
i
thought
he
is
now
doing
i
think
what
he
never
did
for
mademoiselle
de
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
the
king
again
appeared
he
had
looked
everywhere
was
completely
out
of
breath
and
as
a
matter
of
course
had
not
discovered
anything
who
still
followed
him
was
fanning
himself
with
his
hat
and
in
a
gasping
voice
asking
for
information
about
la
valliere
from
such
of
the
servants
as
were
about
in
fact
from
every
one
he
met
among
others
he
came
across
manicamp
who
had
arrived
from
fontainebleau
by
easy
stages
for
whilst
others
had
performed
the
journey
in
six
hours
he
had
taken
four
and
twenty
have
you
seen
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
asked
him
whereupon
manicamp
dreamy
and
absent
as
usual
answered
thinking
that
some
one
was
asking
him
about
de
guiche
thank
you
the
comte
is
a
little
and
he
continued
on
his
way
until
he
reached
the
where
d
artagnan
was
whom
he
asked
to
explain
how
it
was
that
the
king
looked
as
he
thought
so
bewildered
to
which
d
artagnan
replied
that
he
was
quite
mistaken
that
the
king
on
the
contrary
was
as
lively
and
merry
as
he
could
possibly
be
in
the
midst
of
all
this
eight
o
clock
struck
it
was
usual
for
the
king
to
take
his
breakfast
at
this
hour
for
the
code
of
etiquette
prescribed
that
the
king
should
always
be
hungry
at
eight
o
clock
his
breakfast
was
laid
upon
a
small
table
in
his
bedroom
and
he
ate
very
fast
of
whom
he
would
not
lose
sight
waited
on
the
king
he
then
disposed
of
several
military
audiences
during
which
he
dispatched
to
see
what
he
could
find
out
then
still
occupied
full
of
anxiety
still
watching
s
return
who
had
sent
out
the
servants
in
every
direction
to
make
inquires
and
who
had
also
gone
himself
the
hour
of
nine
struck
and
the
king
forthwith
passed
into
his
large
cabinet
as
the
clock
was
striking
nine
the
ambassadors
entered
and
as
it
finished
the
two
queens
and
madame
made
their
appearance
there
were
three
ambassadors
from
holland
and
two
from
spain
the
king
glanced
at
them
and
then
bowed
and
at
the
same
moment
entered
an
entrance
which
the
king
regarded
as
far
more
important
in
a
different
sense
however
than
that
of
ambassadors
however
numerous
they
might
be
and
from
whatever
country
they
came
and
so
setting
everything
aside
the
king
made
a
sign
of
interrogation
to
which
the
latter
answered
by
a
most
decisive
negative
the
king
almost
entirely
lost
his
courage
but
as
the
queens
the
members
of
the
nobility
who
were
present
and
the
ambassadors
had
their
eyes
fixed
upon
him
he
overcame
his
emotion
by
a
violent
effort
and
invited
the
latter
to
speak
whereupon
one
of
the
spanish
deputies
made
a
long
oration
in
which
he
boasted
the
advantages
which
the
spanish
alliance
would
offer
the
king
interrupted
him
saying
monsieur
i
trust
that
whatever
is
best
for
france
must
be
exceedingly
advantageous
for
this
remark
and
particularly
the
peremptory
tone
in
which
it
was
pronounced
made
the
ambassadors
pale
and
brought
the
color
into
the
cheeks
of
the
two
queens
who
being
spanish
felt
wounded
in
their
pride
of
relationship
and
nationality
by
this
reply
the
dutch
ambassador
then
began
to
address
himself
to
the
king
and
complained
of
the
injurious
suspicions
which
the
king
exhibited
against
the
government
of
his
country
the
king
interrupted
him
saying
it
is
very
singular
monsieur
that
you
should
come
with
any
complaint
when
it
is
i
rather
who
have
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
and
yet
you
see
i
do
not
complain
sire
and
in
what
respect
the
king
smiled
bitterly
will
you
blame
me
monsieur
he
said
if
i
should
happen
to
entertain
suspicions
against
a
government
which
authorizes
and
protects
international
impertinence
sire
i
tell
you
resumed
the
king
exciting
himself
by
a
recollection
of
his
own
personal
annoyance
rather
than
from
political
grounds
that
holland
is
a
land
of
refuge
for
all
who
hate
me
and
especially
for
all
who
malign
oh
sire
you
wish
for
proofs
perhaps
very
good
they
can
be
had
easily
enough
whence
proceed
all
those
vile
and
insolent
pamphlets
which
represent
me
as
a
monarch
without
glory
and
without
authority
your
groan
under
their
number
if
my
secretaries
were
here
i
would
mention
the
titles
of
the
works
as
well
as
the
names
of
the
sire
replied
the
ambassador
a
pamphlet
can
hardly
be
regarded
as
the
work
of
a
whole
nation
is
it
just
is
it
reasonable
that
a
great
and
powerful
monarch
like
your
majesty
should
render
a
whole
nation
responsible
for
the
crime
of
a
few
madmen
who
are
perhaps
only
scribbling
in
a
garret
for
a
few
sous
to
buy
bread
for
their
family
that
may
be
the
case
i
admit
but
when
the
mint
itself
at
amsterdam
strikes
off
medals
which
reflect
disgrace
upon
me
is
that
also
the
crime
of
a
few
madmen
medals
stammered
out
the
ambassador
medals
repeated
the
king
looking
at
colbert
your
majesty
the
ambassador
ventured
should
be
quite
sure
the
king
still
looked
at
colbert
but
colbert
appeared
not
to
understand
him
and
maintained
an
unbroken
silence
notwithstanding
the
king
s
repeated
hints
d
artagnan
then
approached
the
king
and
taking
a
piece
of
money
out
of
his
pocket
he
placed
it
in
the
king
s
hands
saying
is
the
medal
your
majesty
alludes
the
king
looked
at
it
and
with
a
look
which
ever
since
he
had
become
his
own
master
was
ever
piercing
as
the
eagle
s
observed
an
insulting
device
representing
holland
arresting
the
progress
of
the
sun
with
this
inscription
conspectu
meo
stetit
in
my
presence
the
sun
stands
still
exclaimed
the
king
furiously
ah
you
will
hardly
deny
it
now
i
and
the
sun
said
d
artagnan
is
this
as
he
pointed
to
the
panels
of
the
cabinet
where
the
sun
was
brilliantly
represented
in
every
direction
with
this
motto
pluribus
louis
s
anger
increased
by
the
bitterness
of
his
own
personal
sufferings
hardly
required
this
additional
circumstance
to
foment
it
every
one
saw
from
the
kindling
passion
in
the
king
s
eyes
that
an
explosion
was
imminent
a
look
from
colbert
kept
postponed
the
bursting
of
the
storm
the
ambassador
ventured
to
frame
excuses
by
saying
that
the
vanity
of
nations
was
a
matter
of
little
consequence
that
holland
was
proud
that
with
such
limited
resources
she
had
maintained
her
rank
as
a
great
nation
even
against
powerful
monarchs
and
that
if
a
little
smoke
had
intoxicated
his
countrymen
the
king
would
be
kindly
disposed
and
would
even
excuse
this
intoxication
the
king
seemed
as
if
he
would
be
glad
of
some
suggestion
he
looked
at
colbert
who
remained
impassible
then
at
d
artagnan
who
simply
shrugged
his
shoulders
a
movement
which
was
like
the
opening
of
the
whereby
the
king
s
anger
which
he
had
restrained
for
so
long
a
period
now
burst
forth
as
no
one
knew
what
direction
his
anger
might
take
all
preserved
a
dead
silence
the
second
ambassador
took
advantage
of
it
to
begin
his
excuses
also
while
he
was
speaking
and
while
the
king
who
had
again
gradually
returned
to
his
own
personal
reflections
was
automatically
listening
to
the
voice
full
of
nervous
anxiety
with
the
air
of
an
absent
man
listening
to
the
murmuring
of
a
cascade
d
artagnan
on
whose
left
hand
was
standing
approached
the
latter
and
in
a
voice
which
was
loud
enough
to
reach
the
king
s
ears
said
have
you
heard
the
news
what
news
said
about
la
the
king
started
and
advanced
his
head
what
has
happened
to
la
valliere
inquired
in
a
tone
which
can
easily
be
imagined
ah
poor
girl
she
is
going
to
take
the
the
veil
exclaimed
the
veil
cried
the
king
in
the
midst
of
the
ambassador
s
discourse
but
then
mindful
of
the
rules
of
etiquette
he
mastered
himself
still
listening
however
with
rapt
attention
what
order
inquired
the
carmelites
of
who
the
deuce
told
you
that
she
did
you
have
seen
her
then
nay
i
even
went
with
her
to
the
the
king
did
not
lose
a
syllable
of
this
conversation
and
again
he
could
hardly
control
his
feelings
but
what
was
the
cause
of
her
flight
inquired
because
the
poor
girl
was
driven
away
from
the
court
yesterday
replied
d
artagnan
he
had
no
sooner
said
this
than
the
king
with
an
authoritative
gesture
said
to
the
ambassador
enough
monsieur
then
advancing
towards
the
captain
he
exclaimed
who
says
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
is
going
to
take
the
religious
vows
m
d
artagnan
answered
the
favorite
is
it
true
what
you
say
said
the
king
turning
towards
the
musketeer
as
true
as
truth
the
king
clenched
his
hands
and
turned
pale
you
have
something
further
to
add
d
artagnan
he
said
i
know
nothing
more
you
added
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
been
driven
away
from
the
yes
is
that
true
also
ascertain
for
yourself
and
from
whom
ah
sighed
d
artagnan
like
a
man
who
is
declining
to
say
anything
further
the
king
almost
bounded
from
his
seat
regardless
of
ambassadors
ministers
courtiers
queens
and
politics

had
heard
everything
or
if
she
had
not
heard
everything
she
had
guessed

madame
almost
fainting
from
anger
and
fear
endeavored
to
rise
as
the
had
done
but
she
sank
down
again
upon
her
chair
which
by
an
instinctive
movement
she
made
roll
back
a
few
paces

said
the
king
the
audience
is
over
i
will
communicate
my
answer
or
rather
my
will
to
spain
and
to
holland
and
with
a
proud
imperious
gesture
he
dismissed
the
ambassadors

care
my
son
said
the
indignantly
you
are
hardly
master
of
yourself
i
ah
madame
returned
the
young
lion
with
a
terrible
gesture
if
i
am
not
master
of
myself
i
will
be
i
promise
you
of
those
who
do
me
a
deadly
injury
come
with
me
d
artagnan
and
he
quitted
the
room
in
the
midst
of
general
stupefaction
and
dismay
the
king
hastily
descended
the
staircase
and
was
about
to
cross
the
courtyard
sire
said
d
artagnan
your
majesty
mistakes
the
no
i
am
going
to
the
that
is
useless
sire
for
i
have
horses
ready
for
your
the
king
s
only
answer
was
a
look
but
this
look
promised
more
than
the
ambition
of
three
d
artagnans
could
have
dared
to
hope

although
they
had
not
been
summoned
manicamp
and
malicorne
had
followed
the
king
and
d
artagnan
they
were
both
exceedingly
intelligent
men
except
that
malicorne
was
too
precipitate
owing
to
ambition
while
manicamp
was
frequently
too
tardy
owing
to
indolence
on
this
occasion
however
they
arrived
at
precisely
the
proper
moment
five
horses
were
in
readiness
two
were
seized
upon
by
the
king
and
d
artagnan
two
others
by
manicamp
and
malicorne
while
a
groom
belonging
to
the
stables
mounted
the
fifth
the
cavalcade
set
off
at
a
gallop
d
artagnan
had
been
very
careful
in
his
selection
of
the
horses
they
were
the
very
animals
for
distressed
lovers
horses
which
did
not
simply
run
but
flew
within
ten
minutes
after
their
departure
the
cavalcade
amidst
a
cloud
of
dust
arrived
at
chaillot
the
king
literally
threw
himself
off
his
horse
but
notwithstanding
the
rapidity
with
which
he
accomplished
this
maneuver
he
found
d
artagnan
already
holding
his
stirrup
with
a
sign
of
acknowledgement
to
the
musketeer
he
threw
the
bridle
to
the
groom
and
darted
into
the
vestibule
violently
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
manicamp
malicorne
and
the
groom
remained
outside
d
artagnan
alone
following
him
when
he
entered
the
the
first
object
which
met
his
gaze
was
louise
herself
not
simply
on
her
knees
but
lying
at
the
foot
of
a
large
stone
crucifix
the
young
girl
was
stretched
upon
the
damp
scarcely
visible
in
the
gloom
of
the
apartment
which
was
lighted
only
by
means
of
a
narrow
window
protected
by
bars
and
completely
shaded
by
creeping
plants
when
the
king
saw
her
in
this
state
he
thought
she
was
dead
and
uttered
a
loud
cry
which
made
d
artagnan
hurry
into
the
room
the
king
had
already
passed
one
of
his
arms
round
her
body
and
d
artagnan
assisted
him
in
raising
the
poor
girl
whom
the
torpor
of
death
seemed
already
to
have
taken
possession
of
d
artagnan
seized
hold
of
the
and
rang
with
all
his
might
the
carmelite
sisters
immediately
hastened
at
the
summons
and
uttered
loud
exclamations
of
alarm
and
indignation
at
the
sight
of
the
two
men
holding
a
woman
in
their
arms
the
superior
also
hurried
to
the
scene
of
action
but
far
more
a
creature
of
the
world
than
any
of
the
female
members
of
the
court
notwithstanding
her
austerity
of
manners
she
recognized
the
king
at
the
first
glance
by
the
respect
which
those
present
exhibited
for
him
as
well
as
by
the
imperious
and
authoritative
way
in
which
he
had
thrown
the
whole
establishment
into
confusion
as
soon
as
she
saw
the
king
she
retired
to
her
own
apartments
in
order
to
avoid
compromising
her
dignity
but
by
one
of
the
nuns
she
sent
various
cordials
hungary
water
and
ordered
that
all
the
doors
should
immediately
be
closed
a
command
which
was
just
in
time
for
the
king
s
distress
was
fast
becoming
of
a
most
clamorous
and
despairing
character
he
had
almost
decided
to
send
for
his
own
physician
when
la
valliere
exhibited
signs
of
returning
animation
the
first
object
which
met
her
gaze
as
she
opened
her
eyes
was
the
king
at
her
feet
in
all
probability
she
did
not
recognize
him
for
she
uttered
a
deep
sigh
full
of
anguish
and
distress
louis
fixed
his
eyes
devouringly
upon
her
face
and
when
in
the
course
of
a
few
moments
she
recognized
louis
she
endeavored
to
tear
herself
from
his
embrace
oh
heavens
she
murmured
is
not
the
sacrifice
yet
made
no
no
exclaimed
the
king
and
it
shall
be
made
i
notwithstanding
her
weakness
and
utter
despair
she
rose
from
the
ground
saying
it
must
be
made
however
it
must
be
so
do
not
stay
me
in
my
i
leave
you
to
sacrifice
yourself
i
never
never
exclaimed
the
king
well
murmured
d
artagnan
i
may
as
well
go
now
as
soon
as
they
begin
to
speak
we
may
as
well
prevent
there
being
any
and
he
quitted
the
room
leaving
the
lovers
alone
sire
continued
la
valliere
not
another
word
i
implore
you
do
not
destroy
the
only
future
i
can
hope
for
my
salvation
do
not
destroy
the
glory
and
brightness
of
your
own
future
for
a
mere
a
caprice
cried
the
king
oh
sire
it
is
now
only
that
i
can
see
clearly
into
your
you
louise
what
mean
you
an
inexplicable
impulse
foolish
and
unreasonable
in
its
nature
may
ephemerally
appear
to
offer
a
sufficient
excuse
for
your
conduct
but
there
are
duties
imposed
upon
you
which
are
incompatible
with
your
regard
for
a
poor
girl
such
as
i
am
so
forget
i
forget
you
you
have
already
done
so
rather
would
i
you
can
not
love
one
whose
peace
of
mind
you
hold
so
lightly
and
whom
you
so
cruelly
abandoned
last
night
to
the
bitterness
of
what
can
you
mean
explain
yourself
what
did
you
ask
me
yesterday
morning
to
love
you
what
did
you
promise
me
in
return
never
to
let
midnight
pass
without
offering
me
an
opportunity
of
reconciliation
if
by
any
chance
your
anger
should
be
roused
against
oh
forgive
me
louise
forgive
me
i
was
mad
from
jealousy
is
a
sentiment
unworthy
of
a
king
a
man
you
may
become
jealous
again
and
will
end
by
killing
me
be
merciful
then
and
leave
me
now
to
another
word
mademoiselle
in
that
strain
and
you
will
see
me
expire
at
your
no
no
sire
i
am
better
acquainted
with
my
own
demerits
and
believe
me
that
to
sacrifice
yourself
for
one
whom
all
despise
would
be
give
me
the
names
of
those
you
have
cause
to
complain
i
have
no
complaints
sire
to
prefer
against
any
one
no
one
but
myself
to
accuse
farewell
sire
you
are
compromising
yourself
in
speaking
to
me
in
such
a
oh
be
careful
louise
in
what
you
say
for
you
are
reducing
me
to
the
darkness
of
oh
sire
sire
leave
me
at
least
the
protection
of
heaven
i
implore
no
no
heaven
itself
shall
not
tear
you
from
save
me
then
cried
the
poor
girl
from
those
determined
and
pitiless
enemies
who
are
thirsting
to
annihilate
my
life
and
honor
too
if
you
have
courage
enough
to
love
me
show
at
least
that
you
have
power
enough
to
defend
me
but
no
she
whom
you
say
you
love
others
insult
and
mock
and
drive
shamelessly
and
the
girl
forced
by
her
own
bitter
distress
to
accuse
others
wrung
her
hands
in
an
uncontrollable
agony
of
tears
you
have
been
driven
away
exclaimed
the
king
this
is
the
second
time
i
have
heard
that
i
have
been
driven
away
with
shame
and
ignominy
sire
you
see
then
that
i
have
no
other
protector
but
heaven
no
consolation

your
park

i
say
nay
this
very
day
i
have
already
shown
my
displeasure

already
threatened
it
is
in
my
power
even
now
to
hurl
the
thunderbolt
i
have
hitherto
withheld
louise
louise
you
shall
be
bitterly
revenged

of
blood
shall
repay
you
for
the
tears
you
have
shed
give
me
only
the
names
of
your
never
how
can
i
show
any
anger
then
sire
those
upon
whom
your
anger
would
be
prepared
to
fall
would
force
you
to
draw
back
your
hand
upraised
to
oh
you
do
not
know
me
cried
the
king
exasperated
rather
than
draw
back
i
would
sacrifice
my
kingdom
and
would
abjure
my
family
yes
i
would
strike
until
this
arm
had
utterly
destroyed
all
those
who
had
ventured
to
make
themselves
the
enemies
of
the
gentlest
and
best
of
and
as
he
said
these
words
louis
struck
his
fist
violently
against
the
oaken
wainscoting
with
a
force
which
alarmed
la
valliere
for
his
anger
owing
to
his
unbounded
power
had
something
imposing
and
threatening
in
it
like
the
lightning
which
may
at
any
time
prove
deadly
she
who
thought
that
her
own
sufferings
could
not
be
surpassed
was
overwhelmed
by
a
suffering
which
revealed
itself
by
menace
and
by
violence
sire
she
said
for
the
last
time
i
implore
you
to
leave
me
already
do
i
feel
strengthened
by
the
calm
seclusion
of
this
asylum
and
the
protection
of
heaven
has
reassured
me
for
all
the
pretty
human
meanness
of
this
world
are
forgotten
beneath
the
divine
protection
once
more
then
sire
and
for
the
last
time
i
again
implore
you
to
leave
confess
rather
cried
louis
that
you
have
never
loved
me
admit
that
my
humility
and
my
repentance
are
flattering
to
your
pride
but
that
my
distress
affects
you
not
that
the
king
of
this
wide
realm
is
no
longer
regarded
as
a
lover
whose
tenderness
of
devotion
is
capable
of
working
out
your
happiness
but
as
a
despot
whose
caprice
has
crushed
your
very
heart
beneath
his
iron
heel
do
not
say
you
are
seeking
heaven
say
rather
you
are
fleeing
from
the
louise
s
heart
was
wrung
within
her
as
she
listened
to
his
passionate
utterance
which
made
the
fever
of
hope
course
once
more
through
her
every
vein
but
did
you
not
hear
me
say
that
i
have
been
driven
away
scorned
despised
i
will
make
you
the
most
respected
and
most
adored
and
the
most
envied
of
my
whole
prove
to
me
that
you
have
not
ceased
to
love
in
what
way
by
leaving
i
will
prove
it
to
you
by
never
leaving
you
but
do
you
imagine
sire
that
i
shall
allow
that
do
you
imagine
that
i
will
let
you
come
to
an
open
rupture
with
every
member
of
your
family
do
you
imagine
that
for
my
sake
you
could
abandon
mother
wife
and
sister
ah
you
have
named
them
then
at
last
it
is
they
then
who
have
wrought
this
grievous
injury
by
the
heaven
above
us
then
upon
them
shall
my
anger
that
is
the
reason
why
the
future
terrifies
me
why
i
refuse
everything
why
i
do
not
wish
you
to
revenge
me
tears
enough
have
already
been
shed
sufficient
sorrow
and
affliction
have
already
been
occasioned
i
at
least
will
never
be
the
cause
of
sorrow
or
affliction
or
distress
to
whomsoever
it
may
be
for
i
have
mourned
and
suffered
and
wept
too
much
and
do
you
count
sufferings
tears
as
nothing
in
heaven
s
name
sire
do
not
speak
to
me
in
that
manner
i
need
all
my
courage
to
enable
me
to
accomplish
the
louise
louise
i
implore
you
whatever
you
desire
whatever
you
command
whether
vengeance
or
forgiveness
your
slightest
wish
shall
be
obeyed
but
do
not
abandon
alas
sire
we
must
you
do
not
love
me
then
heaven
knows
i
do
it
is
false
louise
it
is
oh
sire
if
i
did
not
love
you
i
should
let
you
do
what
you
please
i
should
let
you
revenge
me
in
return
for
the
insult
which
has
been
inflicted
on
me
i
should
accept
the
brilliant
triumph
to
my
pride
which
you
propose
and
yet
you
can
not
deny
that
i
reject
even
the
sweet
compensation
which
your
affection
affords
that
affection
which
for
me
is
life
itself
for
i
wished
to
die
when
i
thought
that
you
loved
me
no
yes
yes
i
now
know
i
now
perceive
it
you
are
the
sweetest
best
and
purest
of
women
there
is
no
one
so
worthy
as
yourself
not
alone
of
my
respect
and
devotion
but
also
of
the
respect
and
devotion
of
all
who
surround
me
and
therefore
no
one
shall
be
loved
like
yourself
no
one
shall
ever
possess
the
influence
over
me
that
you
wield
you
wish
me
to
be
calm
to
forgive
be
it
so
you
shall
find
me
perfectly
unmoved
you
wish
to
reign
by
gentleness
and
clemency
i
will
be
clement
and
gentle
dictate
for
me
the
conduct
you
wish
me
to
adopt
and
i
will
obey
in
heaven
s
name
no
sire
what
am
i
a
poor
girl
to
dictate
to
so
great
a
monarch
as
yourself
you
are
my
life
the
very
spirit
and
principle
of
my
being
is
it
not
the
spirit
that
rules
the
body
you
love
me
then
sire
on
my
knees
yes
with
my
hands
upraised
to
you
yes
with
all
the
strength
and
power
of
my
being
yes
i
love
you
so
deeply
that
i
would
lay
down
my
life
for
you
gladly
at
your
merest
oh
sire
now
i
know
you
love
me
i
have
nothing
to
wish
for
in
the
world
give
me
your
hand
sire
and
then
farewell
i
have
enjoyed
in
this
life
all
the
happiness
i
was
ever
meant
oh
no
no
your
happiness
is
not
a
happiness
of
yesterday
it
is
of
of
ever
enduring
the
future
is
yours
everything
which
is
mine
is
yours
too
away
with
these
ideas
of
separation
away
with
these
gloomy
despairing
thoughts
you
will
live
for
me
as
i
will
live
for
you
and
he
threw
himself
at
her
feet
embracing
her
knees
with
the
wildest
transports
of
joy
and
gratitude
oh
sire
sire
all
that
is
but
a
wild
why
a
wild
dream
because
i
can
not
return
to
the
court
exiled
how
can
i
see
you
again
would
it
not
be
far
better
to
bury
myself
in
a
cloister
for
the
rest
of
my
life
with
the
rich
consolation
that
your
affection
gives
me
with
the
pulses
of
your
heart
beating
for
me
and
your
latest
confession
of
attachment
still
ringing
in
my
ears
exiled
you
exclaimed
louis
and
who
dares
to
exile
let
me
ask
when
i
recall
oh
sire
something
which
is
greater
than
and
superior
to
the
kings
even
the
world
and
public
opinion
reflect
for
a
moment
you
can
not
love
a
woman
who
has
been
ignominiously
driven
away
love
one
whom
your
mother
has
stained
with
suspicions
one
whom
your
sister
has
threatened
with
disgrace
such
a
woman
indeed
would
be
unworthy
of
unworthy
one
who
belongs
to
me
yes
sire
precisely
on
that
account
from
the
very
moment
she
belongs
to
you
the
character
of
your
mistress
renders
her
you
are
right
louise
every
shade
of
delicacy
of
feeling
is
yours
very
well
you
shall
not
be
ah
from
the
tone
in
which
you
speak
you
have
not
heard
madame
that
is
very
i
will
appeal
from
her
to
my
again
sire
you
have
not
seen
your
she
too
my
poor
louise
every
one
s
hand
then
is
against
yes
yes
poor
louise
who
was
already
bending
beneath
the
fury
of
the
storm
when
you
arrived
and
crushed
her
beneath
the
weight
of
your
oh
forgive
you
will
not
i
know
be
able
to
make
either
of
them
yield
believe
me
the
evil
can
not
be
repaired
for
i
will
not
allow
you
to
use
violence
or
to
exercise
your
very
well
louise
to
prove
to
you
how
fondly
i
love
you
i
will
do
one
thing
i
will
see
madame
i
will
make
her
revoke
her
sentence
i
will
compel
her
to
do
compel
oh
no
no
true
you
are
right
i
will
bend
louise
shook
her
head
i
will
entreat
her
if
it
be
necessary
said
louis
will
you
believe
in
my
affection
after
that
louise
drew
herself
up
oh
never
never
shall
you
humiliate
yourself
on
my
account
sooner
a
thousand
times
would
i
louis
reflected
his
features
assumed
a
dark
expression
i
will
love
you
as
much
as
you
have
loved
i
will
suffer
as
keenly
as
you
have
suffered
this
shall
be
my
expiation
in
your
eyes
come
mademoiselle
put
aside
these
paltry
considerations
let
us
show
ourselves
as
great
as
our
sufferings
as
strong
as
our
affection
for
each
and
as
he
said
this
he
took
her
in
his
arms
and
encircled
her
waist
with
both
his
hands
saying
my
own
love
my
own
dearest
and
best
beloved
follow
she
made
a
final
effort
in
which
she
concentrated
no
longer
all
of
her
firmness
of
will
for
that
had
long
since
been
overcome
but
all
her
physical
strength
no
she
replied
weakly
no
no
i
should
die
from
no
you
shall
return
like
a
queen
no
one
knows
of
your
having
left
except
indeed
d
he
has
betrayed
me
then
in
what
way
he
promised
faithfully
i
promised
not
to
say
anything
to
the
king
said
d
artagnan
putting
his
head
through
the
door
and
i
kept
my
word
i
was
speaking
to
de
and
it
was
not
my
fault
if
the
king
overheard
me
was
it
sire
it
is
quite
true
said
the
king
forgive
la
valliere
smiled
and
held
out
her
small
white
hand
to
the
musketeer
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
the
king
be
good
enough
to
see
if
you
can
find
a
carriage
for
mademoiselle
de
la
sire
said
the
captain
the
carriage
is
waiting
at
the
you
are
a
magic
mould
of
forethought
exclaimed
the
king
you
have
taken
a
long
time
to
find
it
out
muttered
d
artagnan
notwithstanding
he
was
flattered
by
the
praise
bestowed
upon
him
la
valliere
was
overcome
after
a
little
further
hesitation
she
allowed
herself
to
be
led
away
half
fainting
by
her
royal
lover
but
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
she
tore
herself
from
the
king
s
grasp
and
returned
to
the
stone
crucifix
which
she
kissed
saying
oh
heaven
it
was
thou
who
drewest
me
hither
thou
who
has
rejected
me
but
thy
grace
is
infinite
whenever
i
shall
again
return
forget
that
i
have
ever
separated
myself
from
thee
for
when
i
return
it
will
be
never
to
leave
thee
the
king
could
not
restrain
his
emotion
and
d
artagnan
even
was
overcome
louis
led
the
young
girl
away
lifted
her
into
the
carriage
and
directed
d
artagnan
to
seat
himself
beside
her
while
he
mounting
his
horse
spurred
violently
towards
the
palais
royal
where
immediately
on
his
arrival
he
sent
to
request
an
audience
of
madame
chapter
xxx
madame
from
the
manner
in
which
the
king
had
dismissed
the
ambassadors
even
the
least
persons
belonging
to
the
court
imagined
war
would
ensue
the
ambassadors
themselves
but
slightly
acquainted
with
the
king
s
domestic
disturbances
had
interpreted
as
directed
against
themselves
the
celebrated
sentence
if
i
be
not
master
of
myself
i
at
least
will
be
so
of
those
who
insult
happily
for
the
destinies
of
france
and
holland
colbert
had
followed
them
out
of
the
king
s
presence
for
the
purpose
of
explaining
matters
to
them
but
the
two
queens
and
madame
who
were
perfectly
aware
of
every
particular
that
had
taken
place
in
their
several
households
having
heard
the
king
s
remark
so
full
of
dark
meaning
retired
to
their
own
apartments
in
no
little
fear
and
chagrin
madame
especially
felt
that
the
royal
anger
might
fall
upon
her
and
as
she
was
brave
and
exceedingly
proud
instead
of
seeking
support
and
encouragement
from
the
she
had
returned
to
her
own
apartments
if
not
without
some
uneasiness
at
least
without
any
intention
of
avoiding
an
encounter
anne
of
austria
from
time
to
time
at
frequent
intervals
sent
messages
to
learn
if
the
king
had
returned
the
silence
which
the
whole
palace
preserved
upon
the
matter
and
upon
louise
s
disappearance
was
indicative
of
a
long
train
of
misfortunes
to
all
those
who
knew
the
haughty
and
irritable
humor
of
the
king
but
madame
unmoved
in
spite
of
all
the
flying
rumors
shut
herself
up
in
her
apartments
sent
for
montalais
and
with
a
voice
as
calm
as
she
could
possibly
command
desired
her
to
relate
all
she
knew
about
the
event
itself
at
the
moment
that
the
eloquent
montalais
was
concluding
with
all
kinds
of
oratorical
precautions
and
was
recommending
if
not
in
actual
language
at
least
in
spirit
that
she
should
show
forbearance
towards
la
valliere
malicorne
made
his
appearance
to
beg
an
audience
of
madame
on
behalf
of
the
king
montalais
s
worthy
friend
bore
upon
his
countenance
all
the
signs
of
the
very
liveliest
emotion
it
was
impossible
to
be
mistaken
the
interview
which
the
king
requested
would
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
chapters
in
the
history
of
the
hearts
of
kings
and
of
men
madame
was
disturbed
by
her
s
arrival
she
did
not
expect
it
so
soon
nor
had
she
indeed
expected
any
direct
step
on
louis
s
part
besides
all
women
who
wage
war
successfully
by
indirect
means
are
invariably
neither
very
skillful
nor
very
strong
when
it
becomes
a
question
of
accepting
a
pitched
battle
madame
however
was
not
one
who
ever
drew
back
she
had
the
very
opposite
defect
or
qualification
in
whichever
light
it
may
be
considered
she
took
an
exaggerated
view
of
what
constituted
real
courage
and
therefore
the
king
s
message
of
which
malicorne
had
been
the
bearer
was
regarded
by
her
as
the
proclaiming
the
commencement
of
hostilities
she
therefore
boldly
accepted
the
gage
of
battle
five
minutes
afterwards
the
king
ascended
the
staircase
his
color
was
heightened
from
having
ridden
hard
his
dusty
and
disordered
clothes
formed
a
singular
contrast
with
the
fresh
and
perfectly
arranged
toilette
of
madame
who
notwithstanding
the
rouge
on
her
cheeks
turned
pale
as
louis
entered
the
room
louis
lost
no
time
in
approaching
the
object
of
his
visit
he
sat
down
and
montalais
disappeared
my
dear
sister
said
the
king
you
are
aware
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
fled
from
her
own
room
this
morning
and
that
she
has
retired
to
a
cloister
overwhelmed
by
grief
and
as
he
pronounced
these
words
the
king
s
voice
was
singularly
moved
your
majesty
is
the
first
to
inform
me
of
it
replied
madame
i
should
have
thought
that
you
might
have
learned
it
this
morning
during
the
reception
of
the
ambassadors
said
the
king
from
your
emotion
sire
i
imagined
that
something
extraordinary
had
happened
but
without
knowing
the
king
with
his
usual
frankness
went
straight
to
the
point
why
did
you
send
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
away
because
i
had
reason
to
be
dissatisfied
with
her
conduct
she
replied
dryly
the
king
became
crimson
and
his
eyes
kindled
with
a
fire
which
it
required
all
madame
s
courage
to
support
he
mastered
his
anger
however
and
continued
a
stronger
reason
than
that
is
surely
requisite
for
one
so
good
and
kind
as
you
are
to
turn
away
and
dishonor
not
only
the
young
girl
herself
but
every
member
of
her
family
as
well
you
know
that
the
whole
city
has
its
eyes
fixed
upon
the
conduct
of
the
female
portion
of
the
court
to
dismiss
a
maid
of
honor
is
to
attribute
a
crime
to
her
at
the
very
least
a
fault
what
crime
what
fault
has
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
been
guilty
of
since
you
constitute
yourself
the
protector
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
replied
madame
coldly
i
will
give
you
those
explanations
which
i
should
have
a
perfect
right
to
withhold
from
every
even
from
the
king
exclaimed
louis
as
with
a
sudden
gesture
he
covered
his
head
with
his
hat
you
have
called
me
your
sister
said
madame
and
i
am
in
my
own
it
matters
not
said
the
youthful
monarch
ashamed
at
having
been
hurried
away
by
his
anger
neither
you
nor
any
one
else
in
this
kingdom
can
assert
a
right
to
withhold
an
explanation
in
my
since
that
is
the
way
you
regard
it
said
madame
in
a
hoarse
angry
tone
of
voice
all
that
remains
for
me
to
do
is
bow
submission
to
your
majesty
and
to
be
not
so
let
there
be
no
equivocation
between
the
protection
with
which
you
surround
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
does
not
impose
any
no
equivocation
i
repeat
you
are
perfectly
aware
that
as
the
head
of
the
nobility
in
france
i
am
accountable
to
all
for
the
honor
of
every
family
you
dismiss
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
or
whoever
else
it
may
be
madame
shrugged
her
shoulders
or
whoever
else
it
may
be
i
repeat
continued
the
king
and
as
acting
in
that
manner
you
cast
a
dishonorable
reflection
upon
that
person
i
ask
you
for
an
explanation
in
order
that
i
may
confirm
or
annul
the
annul
my
sentence
exclaimed
madame
haughtily
what
when
i
have
discharged
one
of
my
attendants
do
you
order
me
to
take
her
back
again
the
king
remained
silent
this
would
be
a
sheer
abuse
of
power
sire
it
would
be
indecorous
and
madame
as
a
woman
i
should
revolt
against
an
abuse
so
insulting
to
me
i
should
no
longer
be
able
to
regard
myself
as
a
princess
of
your
blood
a
daughter
of
a
monarch
i
should
be
the
meanest
of
creatures
more
humbled
and
disgraced
than
the
servant
i
had
sent
the
king
rose
from
his
seat
with
anger
it
can
not
be
a
heart
he
cried
you
have
beating
in
your
bosom
if
you
act
in
such
a
way
with
me
i
may
have
reason
to
act
with
corresponding
it
sometimes
happens
that
in
a
battle
a
chance
ball
may
reach
its
mark
the
observation
which
the
king
had
made
without
any
particular
intention
struck
madame
home
and
staggered
her
for
a
moment
some
day
or
other
she
might
indeed
have
reason
to
dread
reprisals
at
all
events
sire
she
said
explain
what
you
i
ask
madame
what
has
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
done
to
warrant
your
conduct
toward
her
she
is
the
most
cunning
fomenter
of
intrigues
i
know
she
was
the
occasion
of
two
personal
friends
engaging
in
mortal
combat
and
has
made
people
talk
of
her
in
such
shameless
terms
that
the
whole
court
is
indignant
at
the
mere
sound
of
her
she
she
cried
the
king
under
her
soft
and
hypocritical
manner
continued
madame
she
hides
a
disposition
full
of
foul
and
dark
she
you
may
possibly
be
deceived
sire
but
i
know
her
right
well
she
is
capable
of
creating
dispute
and
misunderstanding
between
the
most
affectionate
relatives
and
the
most
intimate
friends
you
see
that
she
has
already
sown
discord
betwixt
us
i
do
assure
you
said
the
king
sire
look
well
into
the
case
as
it
stands
we
were
living
on
the
most
friendly
understanding
and
by
the
artfulness
of
her
tales
and
complaints
she
has
set
your
majesty
against
i
swear
to
you
said
the
king
that
on
no
occasion
has
a
bitter
word
ever
passed
her
lips
i
swear
that
even
in
my
wildest
bursts
of
passion
she
would
not
allow
me
to
menace
any
one
and
i
swear
too
that
you
do
not
possess
a
more
devoted
and
respectful
friend
than
she
friend
said
madame
with
an
expression
of
supreme
disdain
take
care
madame
said
the
king
you
forget
that
you
now
understand
me
and
that
from
this
moment
everything
is
equalized
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
will
be
whatever
i
may
choose
her
to
become
and
if
i
were
determined
to
do
so
i
could
seat
her
on
a
she
was
not
born
to
a
throne
at
least
and
whatever
you
may
do
can
affect
the
future
alone
but
can
not
affect
the
madame
towards
you
i
have
shown
every
kind
consideration
and
every
eager
desire
to
please
you
do
not
remind
me
that
i
am
it
is
the
second
time
sire
that
you
have
made
that
remark
and
i
have
already
informed
you
i
am
ready
to
in
that
case
then
you
will
confer
upon
me
the
favor
of
receiving
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
back
for
what
purpose
sire
since
you
have
a
throne
to
bestow
upon
her
i
am
too
insignificant
to
protect
so
exalted
a
nay
a
truce
to
this
bitter
and
disdainful
spirit
grant
me
her
you
drive
me
then
to
open
warfare
in
my
own
i
too
have
a
family
with
whom
i
can
find
do
you
mean
that
as
a
threat
and
could
you
forget
yourself
so
far
do
you
believe
that
if
you
push
the
affront
to
that
extent
your
family
would
encourage
you
i
hope
sire
that
you
will
not
force
me
to
take
any
step
which
would
be
unworthy
of
my
i
hoped
that
you
would
remember
our
recent
friendship
and
that
you
would
treat
me
as
a
madame
paused
for
a
moment
i
do
not
disown
you
for
a
brother
she
said
in
refusing
your
majesty
an
an
injustice
oh
sire
if
i
informed
others
of
la
valliere
s
conduct
if
the
queen
knew
come
come
henrietta
let
your
heart
speak
remember
that
for
however
brief
a
time
you
once
loved
me
remember
too
that
human
hearts
should
be
as
merciful
as
the
heart
of
a
sovereign
master
do
not
be
inflexible
with
others
forgive
la
i
can
not
she
has
offended
but
for
my
sire
it
is
for
your
sake
i
would
do
anything
in
the
world
except
you
will
drive
me
to
despair
you
compel
me
to
turn
to
the
last
resource
of
weak
people
and
seek
counsel
of
my
angry
and
wrathful
i
advise
you
to
be
reasonable
i
can
be
so
no
nay
sire
i
pray
you
for
pity
s
sake
henrietta
it
is
the
first
time
i
entreated
any
one
and
i
have
no
hope
in
any
one
but
in
oh
sire
you
are
from
rage
from
humiliation
that
i
the
king
should
have
been
obliged
to
descend
to
entreaty
i
shall
hate
this
moment
during
my
whole
life
you
have
made
me
suffer
in
one
moment
more
distress
and
more
degradation
than
i
could
have
anticipated
in
the
greatest
extremity
in
and
the
king
rose
and
gave
free
vent
to
his
tears
which
in
fact
were
tears
of
anger
and
shame
madame
was
not
touched
exactly
for
the
best
women
when
their
pride
is
hurt
are
without
pity
but
she
was
afraid
that
the
tears
the
king
was
shedding
might
possibly
carry
away
every
soft
and
tender
feeling
in
his
heart
give
what
commands
you
please
sire
she
said
and
since
you
prefer
my
humiliation
to
your
own
although
mine
is
public
and
yours
has
been
witnessed
but
by
myself
alone
speak
i
will
obey
your
no
no
henrietta
exclaimed
louis
transported
with
gratitude
you
will
have
yielded
to
a
brother
s
i
no
longer
have
any
brother
since
i
all
that
i
have
would
be
too
little
in
how
passionately
you
love
sire
when
you
do
love
louis
did
not
answer
he
had
seized
upon
madame
s
hand
and
covered
it
with
kisses
and
so
you
will
receive
this
poor
girl
back
again
and
will
forgive
her
you
will
find
how
gentle
and
she
i
will
maintain
her
in
my
no
you
will
give
her
your
friendship
my
i
never
liked
well
for
my
sake
you
will
treat
her
kindly
will
you
not
henrietta
i
will
treat
her
as
your
the
king
rose
suddenly
to
his
feet
by
this
word
which
had
so
infelicitously
escaped
her
madame
had
destroyed
the
whole
merit
of
her
sacrifice
the
king
felt
freed
from
all
obligations
exasperated
beyond
measure
and
bitterly
offended
he
replied
i
thank
you
madame
i
shall
never
forget
the
service
you
have
rendered
and
saluting
her
with
an
affectation
of
ceremony
he
took
his
leave
of
her
as
he
passed
before
a
glass
he
saw
that
his
eyes
were
red
and
angrily
stamped
his
foot
on
the
ground
but
it
was
too
late
for
malicorne
and
d
artagnan
who
were
standing
at
the
door
had
seen
his
eyes
the
king
has
been
crying
thought
malicorne
d
artagnan
approached
the
king
with
a
respectful
air
and
said
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
sire
it
would
be
better
to
return
to
your
own
apartments
by
the
small
why
because
the
dust
of
the
road
has
left
its
traces
on
your
face
said
d
artagnan
by
heavens
he
thought
when
the
king
has
given
way
like
a
child
let
those
look
to
it
who
may
make
the
lady
weep
for
whom
the
king
sheds
chapter
xxxi
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
madame
was
not
she
was
only
hasty
and
impetuous
the
king
was
not
imprudent
he
was
simply
in
love
hardly
had
they
entered
into
this
compact
which
terminated
in
la
valliere
s
recall
when
they
both
sought
to
make
as
much
as
they
could
by
their
bargain
the
king
wished
to
see
la
valliere
every
moment
of
the
day
while
madame
who
was
sensible
of
the
king
s
annoyance
ever
since
he
had
so
entreated
her
would
not
relinquish
her
revenge
on
la
valliere
without
a
contest
she
planted
every
conceivable
difficulty
in
the
king
s
path
he
was
in
fact
obliged
in
order
to
get
a
glimpse
of
la
valliere
to
be
exceedingly
devoted
in
his
attentions
to
his
and
this
indeed
was
madame
s
plan
of
policy
as
she
had
chosen
some
one
to
second
her
efforts
and
as
this
person
was
our
old
friend
montalais
the
king
found
himself
completely
hemmed
in
every
time
he
paid
madame
a
visit
he
was
surrounded
and
was
never
left
a
moment
alone
madame
displayed
in
her
conversation
a
charm
of
manner
and
brilliancy
of
wit
which
dazzled
everybody
montalais
followed
her
and
soon
rendered
herself
perfectly
insupportable
to
the
king
which
was
in
fact
the
very
thing
she
expected
would
happen
she
then
set
malicorne
at
the
king
who
found
means
of
informing
his
majesty
that
there
was
a
young
person
belonging
to
the
court
who
was
exceedingly
miserable
and
on
the
king
inquiring
who
this
person
was
malicorne
replied
that
it
was
mademoiselle
de
montalais
to
this
the
king
answered
that
it
was
perfectly
just
that
a
person
should
be
unhappy
when
she
rendered
others
so
whereupon
malicorne
explained
how
matters
stood
for
he
had
received
his
directions
from
montalais
the
king
began
to
open
his
eyes
he
remarked
that
as
soon
as
he
made
his
appearance
madame
made
hers
too
that
she
remained
in
the
corridors
until
after
he
had
left
that
she
accompanied
him
back
to
his
own
apartments
fearing
that
he
might
speak
in
the
to
one
of
her
maids
of
honor
one
evening
she
went
further
still
the
king
was
seated
surrounded
by
the
ladies
who
were
present
and
holding
in
his
hand
concealed
by
his
lace
ruffle
a
small
note
which
he
wished
to
slip
into
la
valliere
s
hand
madame
guessed
both
his
intention
and
the
letter
too
it
was
difficult
to
prevent
the
king
going
wherever
he
pleased
and
yet
it
was
necessary
to
prevent
his
going
near
la
valliere
or
speaking
to
her
as
by
so
doing
he
could
let
the
note
fall
into
her
lap
behind
her
fan
or
into
her
the
king
who
was
also
on
the
watch
suspected
that
a
snare
was
being
laid
for
him
he
rose
and
pushed
his
chair
without
affectation
near
mademoiselle
de
chatillon
with
whom
he
began
to
talk
in
a
light
tone
they
were
amusing
themselves
making
rhymes
from
mademoiselle
de
chatillon
he
went
to
montalais
and
then
to
mademoiselle
de
and
thus
by
this
skillful
maneuver
he
found
himself
seated
opposite
to
la
valliere
whom
he
completely
concealed
madame
pretended
to
be
greatly
occupied
altering
a
group
of
flowers
that
she
was
working
in
tapestry
the
king
showed
the
corner
of
his
letter
to
la
valliere
and
the
latter
held
out
her
handkerchief
with
a
look
that
signified
put
the
letter
then
as
the
king
had
placed
his
own
handkerchief
upon
his
chair
he
was
adroit
enough
to
let
it
fall
on
the
ground
so
that
la
valliere
slipped
her
handkerchief
on
the
chair
the
king
took
it
up
quietly
without
any
one
observing
what
he
did
placed
the
letter
within
it
and
returned
the
handkerchief
to
the
place
he
had
taken
it
from
there
was
only
just
time
for
la
valliere
to
stretch
out
her
hand
to
take
hold
of
the
handkerchief
with
its
valuable
contents
but
madame
who
had
observed
everything
that
had
passed
said
to
mademoiselle
de
chatillon
chatillon
be
good
enough
to
pick
up
the
king
s
handkerchief
if
you
please
it
has
fallen
on
the
the
young
girl
obeyed
with
the
utmost
precipitation
the
king
having
moved
from
his
seat
and
la
valliere
being
in
no
little
degree
nervous
and
confused
ah
i
beg
your
majesty
s
pardon
said
mademoiselle
de
chatillon
you
have
two
handkerchiefs
i
and
the
king
was
accordingly
obliged
to
put
into
his
pocket
la
valliere
s
handkerchief
as
well
as
his
own
he
certainly
gained
that
souvenir
of
louise
who
lost
however
a
copy
of
verses
which
had
cost
the
king
ten
hours
hard
labor
and
which
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
was
perhaps
as
good
as
a
long
poem
it
would
be
impossible
to
describe
the
king
s
anger
and
la
valliere
s
despair
but
shortly
afterwards
a
circumstance
occurred
which
was
more
than
remarkable
when
the
king
left
in
order
to
retire
to
his
own
apartments
malicorne
informed
of
what
had
passed
one
can
hardly
tell
how
was
waiting
in
the
the
of
the
palais
royal
are
naturally
very
dark
and
in
the
evening
they
were
but
indifferently
lighted
nothing
pleased
the
king
more
than
this
dim
light
as
a
general
rule
love
whose
mind
and
heart
are
constantly
in
a
blaze
contemns
all
light
except
the
sunshine
of
the
soul
and
so
the
was
dark
a
page
carried
a
torch
before
the
king
who
walked
on
slowly
greatly
annoyed
at
what
had
recently
occurred
malicorne
passed
close
to
the
king
almost
stumbled
against
him
in
fact
and
begged
his
forgiveness
with
the
profoundest
humility
but
the
king
who
was
in
an
exceedingly
was
very
sharp
in
his
reproof
to
malicorne
who
disappeared
as
soon
and
as
quietly
as
he
possibly
could
louis
retired
to
rest
having
had
a
misunderstanding
with
the
queen
and
the
next
day
as
soon
as
he
entered
the
cabinet
he
wished
to
have
la
valliere
s
handkerchief
in
order
to
press
his
lips
to
it
he
called
his
valet
fetch
me
he
said
the
coat
i
wore
yesterday
evening
but
be
very
sure
you
do
not
touch
anything
it
may
the
order
being
obeyed
the
king
himself
searched
the
pocket
of
the
coat
he
found
only
one
handkerchief
and
that
his
own
la
valliere
s
had
disappeared
whilst
busied
with
all
kinds
of
conjectures
and
suspicions
a
letter
was
brought
to
him
from
la
valliere
it
ran
thus
how
good
and
kind
of
you
to
have
sent
me
those
beautiful
verses
how
full
of
ingenuity
and
perseverance
your
affection
is
how
is
it
possible
to
help
loving
you
so
dearly
what
does
this
mean
thought
the
king
there
must
be
some
mistake
look
well
about
said
he
to
the
valet
for
a
must
be
in
one
of
my
pockets
and
if
you
do
not
find
it
or
if
you
have
touched
it
he
reflected
for
a
moment
to
make
a
state
matter
of
the
loss
of
the
handkerchief
would
be
to
act
absurdly
and
he
therefore
added
there
was
a
letter
of
some
importance
inside
the
handkerchief
which
had
somehow
got
among
the
folds
of
sire
said
the
valet
your
majesty
had
only
one
handkerchief
and
that
is
true
true
replied
the
king
setting
his
teeth
hard
together
oh
poverty
how
i
envy
you
happy
is
the
man
who
can
empty
his
own
pockets
of
letters
and
handkerchiefs
he
read
la
valliere
s
letter
over
again
endeavoring
to
imagine
in
what
conceivable
way
his
verses
could
have
reached
their
destination
there
was
a
postscript
to
the
letter
i
send
you
back
by
your
messenger
this
reply
so
unworthy
of
what
you
sent
so
far
so
good
i
shall
find
out
something
now
he
said
delightedly
who
is
waiting
and
who
brought
me
this
letter
m
malicorne
replied
the
de
timidly
desire
him
to
come
malicorne
entered
you
come
from
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
said
the
king
with
a
sigh
yes
and
you
took
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
something
from
me
i
sire
yes
oh
no
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
says
so
oh
sire
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
is
the
king
frowned
what
jest
is
this
he
said
explain
yourself
why
does
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
call
you
my
messenger
what
did
you
take
to
that
lady
speak
monsieur
and
sire
i
merely
took
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
a
that
was
a
handkerchief
what
handkerchief
sire
at
the
very
moment
when
i
had
the
misfortune
to
stumble
against
your
majesty
yesterday
a
misfortune
which
i
shall
deplore
to
the
last
day
of
my
life
especially
after
the
dissatisfaction
which
you
exhibited
i
remained
sire
motionless
with
despair
your
majesty
being
at
too
great
a
distance
to
hear
my
excuses
when
i
saw
something
white
lying
on
the
ah
said
the
king
i
stooped
down
it
was
a
for
a
moment
i
had
an
idea
that
when
i
stumbled
against
your
majesty
i
must
have
been
the
cause
of
the
handkerchief
falling
from
your
pocket
but
as
i
felt
it
all
over
very
respectfully
i
perceived
a
cipher
at
one
of
the
corners
and
on
looking
at
it
closely
i
found
that
it
was
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
cipher
i
presumed
that
on
her
way
to
madame
s
apartment
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
she
had
let
her
handkerchief
fall
and
i
accordingly
hastened
to
restore
it
to
her
as
she
was
leaving
and
that
is
all
i
gave
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
i
entreat
your
majesty
to
malicorne
s
manner
was
so
simple
so
full
of
contrition
and
marked
with
such
extreme
humility
that
the
king
was
greatly
amused
in
listening
to
him
he
was
as
pleased
with
him
for
what
he
had
done
as
if
he
had
rendered
him
the
greatest
service
this
is
the
second
fortunate
meeting
i
have
had
with
you
monsieur
he
said
you
may
count
upon
my
good
the
plain
and
sober
truth
was
that
malicorne
had
picked
the
king
s
pocket
of
the
handkerchief
as
dexterously
as
any
of
the
pickpockets
of
the
good
city
of
paris
could
have
done
madame
never
knew
of
this
little
incident
but
montalais
gave
la
valliere
some
idea
of
the
manner
in
which
it
had
really
happened
and
la
valliere
afterwards
told
the
king
who
laughed
exceedingly
at
it
and
pronounced
malicorne
to
be
a
first
rate
politician
louis
xiv
was
right
and
it
is
well
known
that
he
was
tolerably
well
acquainted
with
human
nature
chapter
xxxii
which
treats
of
gardeners
of
ladders
and
maids
of
honor
miracles
unfortunately
could
not
be
always
happening
whilst
madame
s
still
continued
in
a
week
s
time
matters
had
reached
such
a
point
that
the
king
could
no
longer
look
at
la
valliere
without
a
look
full
of
suspicion
crossing
his
own
whenever
a
promenade
was
proposed
madame
in
order
to
avoid
the
recurrence
of
similar
scenes
to
that
of
the
or
the
royal
oak
had
a
variety
of
indispositions
ready
prepared
and
thanks
to
them
she
was
unable
to
go
out
and
her
maids
of
honor
were
obliged
to
remain
indoors
also
there
was
not
the
slightest
chance
of
means
of
paying
a
nocturnal
visit
for
in
this
respect
the
king
had
on
the
very
first
occasion
experienced
a
severe
check
which
happened
in
the
following
manner
as
at
fontainebleau
he
had
taken
with
him
one
evening
when
he
wished
to
pay
la
valliere
a
visit
but
he
had
found
no
one
but
mademoiselle
de
who
had
begun
to
call
out
fire
and
thieves
in
such
a
manner
that
a
perfect
legion
of
attendants
and
pages
ran
to
her
assistance
so
that
who
had
remained
behind
in
order
to
save
the
honor
of
his
royal
master
who
had
fled
precipitately
was
obliged
to
submit
to
a
severe
scolding
from
the
as
well
as
from
madame
herself
in
addition
he
had
the
next
morning
received
two
challenges
from
the
de
mortemart
family
and
the
king
had
been
obliged
to
interfere
this
mistake
had
been
owing
to
the
circumstance
of
madame
having
suddenly
ordered
a
change
in
the
apartments
of
her
maids
of
honor
and
directed
la
valliere
and
montalais
to
sleep
in
her
own
cabinet
no
gateway
therefore
was
any
longer
open
not
even
communication
by
letter
to
write
under
the
eyes
of
so
ferocious
an
argus
as
madame
whose
temper
and
disposition
were
so
uncertain
was
to
run
the
risk
of
exposure
to
the
greatest
danger
and
it
can
well
be
conceived
into
what
a
state
of
continuous
irritation
and
ever
increasing
anger
all
these
petty
annoyances
threw
the
young
lion
the
king
almost
tormented
himself
to
death
endeavoring
to
discover
a
means
of
communication
and
as
he
did
not
think
proper
to
call
in
the
aid
of
malicorne
or
d
artagnan
the
means
were
not
discovered
at
all
malicorne
had
indeed
occasional
brilliant
flashes
of
imagination
with
which
he
tried
to
inspire
the
king
with
confidence
but
whether
from
shame
or
suspicion
the
king
who
had
at
first
begun
to
nibble
at
the
bait
soon
abandoned
the
hook
in
this
way
for
instance
one
evening
while
the
king
was
crossing
the
garden
and
looking
up
at
madame
s
windows
malicorne
stumbled
over
a
ladder
lying
beside
a
border
of
box
and
said
to
manicamp
then
walking
with
him
behind
the
king
did
you
not
see
that
i
just
now
stumbled
against
a
ladder
and
was
nearly
thrown
down
no
said
manicamp
as
usual
very
but
it
appears
you
did
not
that
doesn
t
matter
but
it
is
not
on
that
account
the
less
dangerous
to
leave
ladders
lying
about
in
that
true
one
might
hurt
one
s
self
especially
when
troubled
with
fits
of
absence
of
i
don
t
mean
that
what
i
did
mean
was
that
it
is
dangerous
to
allow
ladders
to
lie
about
so
near
the
windows
of
the
maids
of
louis
started
imperceptibly
why
so
inquired
manicamp
speak
louder
whispered
malicorne
as
he
touched
him
with
his
arm
why
so
said
manicamp
louder
the
king
listened
because
for
instance
said
malicorne
a
ladder
nineteen
feet
high
is
just
the
height
of
the
cornice
of
those
manicamp
instead
of
answering
was
dreaming
of
something
else
ask
me
can
t
you
what
windows
i
mean
whispered
malicorne
but
what
windows
are
you
referring
to
said
manicamp
aloud
the
windows
of
madame
s
eh
oh
i
don
t
say
that
any
one
would
ever
venture
to
go
up
a
ladder
into
madame
s
room
but
in
madame
s
cabinet
merely
separated
by
a
partition
sleep
two
exceedingly
pretty
girls
mesdemoiselles
de
la
valliere
and
de
by
a
partition
said
manicamp
look
you
see
how
brilliantly
lighted
madame
s
apartments
are
well
do
you
see
those
two
windows
and
that
window
close
to
the
others
but
more
dimly
lighted
well
that
is
the
room
of
the
maids
of
honor
look
there
is
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
opening
the
window
ah
how
many
soft
things
could
an
enterprising
lover
say
to
her
if
he
only
suspected
that
there
was
lying
here
a
ladder
nineteen
feet
long
which
would
just
reach
the
but
she
is
not
alone
you
said
mademoiselle
de
montalais
is
with
mademoiselle
de
montalais
counts
for
nothing
she
is
her
oldest
friend
and
exceedingly
devoted
to
her
a
positive
well
into
which
can
be
thrown
all
sorts
of
secrets
one
might
wish
to
get
rid
the
king
did
not
lose
a
single
syllable
of
this
conversation
malicorne
even
remarked
that
his
majesty
slackened
his
pace
in
order
to
give
him
time
to
finish
so
when
they
arrived
at
the
door
louis
dismissed
every
one
with
the
exception
of
malicorne
a
circumstance
which
excited
no
surprise
for
it
was
known
that
the
king
was
in
love
and
they
suspected
he
was
going
to
compose
some
verses
by
moonlight
and
although
there
was
no
moon
that
evening
the
king
might
nevertheless
have
some
verses
to
compose
every
one
therefore
took
his
leave
and
immediately
afterwards
the
king
turned
towards
malicorne
who
respectfully
waited
until
his
majesty
should
address
him
what
were
you
saying
just
now
about
a
ladder
monsieur
malicorne
he
asked
did
i
say
anything
about
ladders
sire
said
malicorne
looking
up
as
if
in
search
of
words
which
had
flown
away
yes
of
a
ladder
nineteen
feet
oh
yes
sire
i
remember
but
i
spoke
to
manicamp
and
i
should
not
have
said
a
word
had
i
known
your
majesty
was
near
enough
to
hear
and
why
would
you
not
have
said
a
word
because
i
should
not
have
liked
to
get
the
gardener
into
a
scrape
who
left
it
there
poor
fellow
don
t
make
yourself
uneasy
on
that
account
what
is
this
ladder
like
if
your
majesty
wishes
to
see
it
nothing
is
easier
for
there
it
in
that
box
hedge
show
it
to
malicorne
turned
back
and
led
the
king
up
to
the
ladder
saying
this
is
it
pull
it
this
way
a
when
malicorne
had
brought
the
ladder
on
to
the
gravel
walk
the
king
began
to
step
its
whole
length
hum
he
said
you
say
it
is
nineteen
feet
long
yes
nineteen
feet
that
is
rather
long
i
hardly
believe
it
can
be
so
long
as
you
can
not
judge
very
correctly
with
the
ladder
in
that
position
sire
if
it
were
upright
against
a
tree
or
a
wall
for
instance
you
would
be
better
able
to
judge
because
the
comparison
would
assist
you
a
good
oh
it
does
not
matter
malicorne
but
i
can
hardly
believe
that
the
ladder
is
nineteen
feet
i
know
how
accurate
your
majesty
s
glance
is
and
yet
i
would
the
king
shook
his
head
there
is
one
unanswerable
means
of
verifying
it
said
malicorne
what
is
that
every
one
knows
sire
that
the
of
the
palace
is
eighteen
feet
true
that
is
very
well
well
sire
if
i
place
the
ladder
against
the
wall
we
shall
be
able
to
malicorne
took
up
the
ladder
like
a
feather
and
placed
it
upright
against
the
wall
and
in
order
to
try
the
experiment
he
chose
or
chance
perhaps
directed
him
to
choose
the
very
window
of
the
cabinet
where
la
valliere
was
the
ladder
just
reached
the
edge
of
the
cornice
that
is
to
say
the
sill
of
the
window
so
that
by
standing
upon
the
last
round
but
one
of
the
ladder
a
man
of
about
the
middle
height
as
the
king
was
for
instance
could
easily
talk
with
those
who
might
be
in
the
room
hardly
had
the
ladder
been
properly
placed
when
the
king
dropping
the
assumed
part
he
had
been
playing
in
the
comedy
began
to
ascend
the
rounds
of
the
ladder
which
malicorne
held
at
the
bottom
but
hardly
had
he
completed
half
the
distance
when
a
patrol
of
swiss
guards
appeared
in
the
garden
and
advanced
straight
towards
them
the
king
descended
with
the
utmost
precipitation
and
concealed
himself
among
the
trees
malicorne
at
once
perceived
that
he
must
offer
himself
as
a
sacrifice
for
if
he
too
were
to
conceal
himself
the
guard
would
search
everywhere
until
they
had
found
either
himself
or
the
king
perhaps
both
it
would
be
far
better
therefore
that
he
alone
should
be
discovered
and
consequently
malicorne
hid
himself
so
clumsily
that
he
was
the
only
one
arrested
as
soon
as
he
was
arrested
malicorne
was
taken
to
the
and
there
he
declared
who
he
was
and
was
immediately
recognized
in
the
meantime
by
concealing
himself
first
behind
one
clump
of
trees
and
then
behind
another
the
king
reached
the
side
door
of
his
apartment
very
much
humiliated
and
still
more
disappointed
more
than
that
the
noise
made
in
arresting
malicorne
had
drawn
la
valliere
and
montalais
to
their
window
and
even
madame
herself
had
appeared
at
her
own
with
a
pair
of
wax
candles
one
in
each
hand
clamorously
asking
what
was
the
matter
in
the
meantime
malicorne
sent
for
d
artagnan
who
did
not
lose
a
moment
in
hurrying
to
him
but
it
was
in
vain
he
attempted
to
make
him
understand
his
reasons
and
in
vain
also
that
d
artagnan
did
understand
them
and
further
it
was
equally
in
vain
that
both
their
sharp
and
intuitive
minds
endeavored
to
give
another
turn
to
the
adventure
there
was
no
other
resource
left
for
malicorne
but
to
let
it
be
supposed
that
he
had
wished
to
enter
mademoiselle
de
montalais
s
apartment
as
had
passed
for
having
wished
to
force
mademoiselle
de
s
door
madame
was
inflexible
in
the
first
place
because
if
malicorne
had
in
fact
wished
to
enter
her
apartment
at
night
through
the
window
and
by
means
of
the
ladder
in
order
to
see
montalais
it
was
a
punishable
offense
on
malicorne
s
part
and
he
must
be
punished
accordingly
and
in
the
second
place
if
malicorne
instead
of
acting
in
his
own
name
had
acted
as
an
intermediary
between
la
valliere
and
a
person
whose
name
it
was
superfluous
to
mention
his
crime
was
in
that
case
even
greater
since
love
which
is
an
excuse
for
everything
did
not
exist
in
the
case
as
an
excuse
madame
therefore
made
the
greatest
possible
disturbance
about
the
matter
and
obtained
his
dismissal
from
monsieur
s
household
without
reflecting
poor
blind
creature
that
both
malicorne
and
montalais
held
her
fast
in
their
clutches
in
consequence
of
her
visit
to
de
guiche
and
in
a
variety
of
other
ways
equally
delicate
montalais
who
was
perfectly
furious
wished
to
revenge
herself
immediately
but
malicorne
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
king
s
countenance
would
repay
them
for
all
the
disgraces
in
the
world
and
that
it
was
a
great
thing
to
have
to
suffer
on
his
majesty
s
account
malicorne
was
perfectly
right
and
therefore
although
montalais
had
the
spirit
of
ten
women
in
her
he
succeeded
in
bringing
her
round
to
his
own
opinion
and
we
must
not
omit
to
state
that
the
king
helped
them
to
console
themselves
for
in
the
first
place
he
presented
malicorne
with
fifty
thousand
francs
as
a
compensation
for
the
post
he
had
lost
and
in
the
next
place
he
gave
him
an
appointment
in
his
own
household
delighted
to
have
an
opportunity
of
revenging
himself
in
such
a
manner
upon
madame
for
all
she
had
made
him
and
la
valliere
suffer
but
as
malicorne
could
no
longer
carry
significant
handkerchiefs
for
him
or
plant
convenient
ladders
the
royal
lover
was
in
a
terrible
state
there
seemed
to
be
no
hope
therefore
of
ever
getting
near
la
valliere
again
so
long
as
she
should
remain
at
the
palais
royal
all
the
dignities
and
all
the
money
in
the
world
could
not
remedy
that
fortunately
however
malicorne
was
on
the
lookout
and
this
so
successfully
that
he
met
montalais
who
to
do
her
justice
it
must
be
admitted
was
doing
her
best
to
meet
malicorne
what
do
you
do
during
the
night
in
madame
s
apartment
he
asked
the
young
girl
why
i
go
to
sleep
of
course
she
replied
but
it
is
very
wrong
to
sleep
it
can
hardly
be
possible
that
with
the
pain
you
are
suffering
you
can
manage
to
do
and
what
am
i
suffering
from
may
i
ask
are
you
not
in
despair
at
my
absence
of
course
not
since
you
have
received
fifty
thousand
francs
and
an
appointment
in
the
king
s
that
is
a
matter
of
no
moment
you
are
exceedingly
afflicted
at
not
seeing
me
as
you
used
to
see
me
formerly
and
more
than
all
you
are
in
despair
at
my
having
lost
madame
s
confidence
come
now
is
not
that
true
perfectly
very
good
your
distress
of
mind
prevents
you
sleeping
at
night
and
so
you
sob
and
sigh
and
blow
your
nose
ten
times
every
minute
as
loud
as
but
my
dear
malicorne
madame
can
not
endure
the
slightest
noise
near
i
know
that
perfectly
well
of
course
she
can
t
endure
anything
and
so
i
tell
you
when
she
hears
your
deep
distress
she
will
turn
you
out
of
her
rooms
without
a
moment
s
i
very
fortunate
you
well
and
what
will
happen
next
the
next
thing
that
will
happen
will
be
that
la
valliere
finding
herself
alone
without
you
will
groan
and
utter
such
loud
lamentations
that
she
will
exhibit
despair
enough
for
in
that
case
she
will
be
put
into
room
don
t
you
see
precisely
yes
but
which
which
yes
that
will
puzzle
you
to
say
not
at
all
whenever
and
whatever
the
room
may
be
it
will
always
be
preferable
to
madame
s
own
that
is
very
good
so
begin
your
lamentations
i
certainly
will
not
fail
to
do
and
give
la
valliere
a
hint
oh
don
t
fear
her
she
cries
quite
enough
already
to
very
well
all
she
has
to
do
is
cry
out
and

chapter
xxxiii
which
treats
of
carpentry
operations
and
furnishes
details
upon
the
mode
of
constructing
staircases
the
advice
which
had
been
given
to
montalais
was
communicated
by
her
to
la
valliere
who
could
not
but
acknowledge
that
it
was
by
no
means
deficient
in
judgment
and
who
after
a
certain
amount
of
resistance
rising
rather
from
timidity
than
indifference
to
the
project
resolved
to
put
it
into
execution
this
story
of
the
two
girls
weeping
and
filling
madame
s
bedroom
with
the
noisiest
lamentations
was
malicorne
s
as
nothing
is
so
probable
as
improbability
so
natural
as
romance
this
kind
of
arabian
nights
story
succeeded
perfectly
with
madame
the
first
thing
she
did
was
to
send
montalais
away
and
then
three
days
or
rather
three
nights
afterwards
she
had
la
valliere
removed
she
gave
the
latter
one
of
the
small
rooms
on
the
top
story
situated
immediately
over
the
apartments
allotted
to
the
gentlemen
of
monsieur
s
suite
one
story
only
that
is
to
say
a
mere
flooring
separated
the
maids
of
honor
from
the
officers
and
gentlemen
of
her
husband
s
household
a
private
staircase
which
was
placed
under
madame
de
navailles
s
surveillance
was
the
only
means
of
communication
for
greater
safety
madame
de
navailles
who
had
heard
of
his
majesty
s
previous
attempts
had
the
windows
of
the
rooms
and
the
openings
of
the
chimneys
carefully
barred
there
was
therefore
every
possible
security
provided
for
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
whose
room
now
bore
more
resemblance
to
a
cage
than
to
anything
else
when
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
was
in
her
own
room
and
she
was
there
very
frequently
for
madame
scarcely
ever
had
any
occasion
for
her
services
since
she
once
knew
she
was
safe
under
madame
de
navailles
s
inspection
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
no
better
means
of
amusing
herself
than
looking
through
the
bars
of
her
windows
it
happened
therefore
that
one
morning
as
she
was
looking
out
as
usual
she
perceived
malicorne
at
one
of
the
windows
exactly
opposite
to
her
own
he
held
a
carpenter
s
rule
in
his
hand
was
surveying
the
buildings
and
seemed
to
be
adding
up
some
figures
on
paper
la
valliere
recognized
malicorne
and
nodded
to
him
malicorne
in
his
turn
replied
by
a
formal
bow
and
disappeared
from
the
window
she
was
surprised
at
this
marked
coolness
so
different
from
his
usual
unfailing
but
she
remembered
that
he
had
lost
his
appointment
on
her
account
and
that
he
could
hardly
be
very
amiably
disposed
towards
her
since
in
all
probability
she
would
never
be
in
a
position
to
make
him
any
recompense
for
what
he
had
lost
she
knew
how
to
forgive
offenses
and
with
still
more
readiness
could
she
sympathize
with
misfortune
la
valliere
would
have
asked
montalais
her
opinion
if
she
had
been
within
hearing
but
she
was
absent
it
being
the
hour
she
commonly
devoted
to
her
own
correspondence
suddenly
la
valliere
observed
something
thrown
from
the
window
where
malicorne
had
been
standing
pass
across
the
open
space
which
separated
the
iron
bars
and
roll
upon
the
floor
she
advanced
with
no
little
curiosity
towards
this
object
and
picked
it
up
it
was
a
wooden
reel
for
silk
only
in
this
instance
instead
of
silk
a
piece
of
paper
was
rolled
round
it
la
valliere
unrolled
it
and
read
as
follows
mademoiselle
i
am
exceedingly
anxious
to
learn
two
things
the
first
is
to
know
if
the
flooring
of
your
apartment
is
wood
or
brick
the
second
to
ascertain
at
what
distance
your
bed
is
placed
from
the
window
forgive
my
importunity
and
will
you
be
good
enough
to
send
me
an
answer
by
the
same
way
you
receive
this
letter
that
is
to
say
by
means
of
the
silk
winder
only
instead
of
throwing
into
my
room
as
i
have
thrown
it
into
yours
which
will
be
too
difficult
for
you
to
attempt
have
the
goodness
merely
to
let
it
fall
believe
me
mademoiselle
your
most
humble
most
respectful
servant
malicorne
write
the
reply
if
you
please
upon
the
letter
ah
poor
fellow
exclaimed
la
valliere
he
must
have
gone
out
of
his
mind
and
she
directed
towards
her
correspondent
of
whom
she
caught
but
a
faint
glimpse
in
consequence
of
the
darkness
of
the
room
a
look
full
of
compassionate
consideration
malicorne
understood
her
and
shook
his
head
as
if
he
meant
to
say
no
no
i
am
not
out
of
my
mind
be
quite
she
smiled
as
if
still
in
doubt
no
no
he
signified
by
a
gesture
my
head
is
right
and
pointed
to
his
head
then
after
moving
his
hand
like
a
man
who
writes
very
rapidly
he
put
his
hands
together
as
if
entreating
her
to
write
la
valliere
even
if
he
were
mad
saw
no
impropriety
in
doing
what
malicorne
requested
her
she
took
a
pencil
and
wrote
wood
and
then
walked
slowly
from
her
window
to
her
bed
and
wrote
six
paces
and
having
done
this
she
looked
out
again
at
malicorne
who
bowed
to
her
signifying
that
he
was
about
to
descend
la
valliere
understood
that
it
was
to
pick
up
the
silk
winder
she
approached
the
window
and
in
accordance
with
malicorne
s
instructions
let
it
fall
the
winder
was
still
rolling
along
the
as
malicorne
started
after
it
overtook
and
picked
it
up
and
beginning
to
peel
it
as
a
monkey
would
do
with
a
nut
he
ran
straight
towards
de
s
apartment
had
chosen
or
rather
solicited
that
his
rooms
might
be
as
near
the
king
as
possible
as
certain
plants
seek
the
sun
s
rays
in
order
to
develop
themselves
more
luxuriantly
his
apartment
consisted
of
two
rooms
in
that
portion
of
the
palace
occupied
by
louis
xiv
himself
de
was
very
proud
of
this
proximity
which
afforded
easy
access
to
his
majesty
and
more
than
that
the
favor
of
occasional
unexpected
meetings
at
the
moment
we
are
now
referring
to
he
was
engaged
in
having
both
his
rooms
magnificently
carpeted
with
expectation
of
receiving
the
honor
of
frequent
visits
from
the
king
for
his
majesty
since
his
passion
for
la
valliere
had
chosen
as
his
confidant
and
could
not
in
fact
do
without
him
either
night
or
day
malicorne
introduced
himself
to
the
comte
and
met
with
no
difficulties
because
he
had
been
favorably
noticed
by
the
king
and
also
because
the
credit
which
one
man
may
happen
to
enjoy
is
always
a
bait
for
others
asked
his
visitor
if
he
brought
any
news
with
him
yes
great
news
replied
the
latter
ah
ah
said
what
is
it
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
has
changed
her
what
do
you
mean
said
opening
his
eyes
very
wide
she
was
living
in
the
same
apartments
as
precisely
so
but
madame
got
tired
of
her
proximity
and
has
installed
her
in
a
room
which
is
situated
exactly
above
your
future
what
up
there
exclaimed
with
surprise
and
pointing
at
the
floor
above
him
with
his
finger
no
said
malicorne
yonder
indicating
the
building
opposite
what
do
you
mean
then
by
saying
that
her
room
is
above
my
apartment
because
i
am
sure
that
your
apartment
providentially
to
be
under
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
at
this
remark
gave
poor
malicorne
a
look
similar
to
one
of
those
la
valliere
had
already
given
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
that
is
to
say
he
thought
he
had
lost
his
senses
monsieur
said
malicorne
to
him
i
wish
to
answer
what
you
are
thinking
what
do
you
mean
by
what
i
am
thinking
about
my
reason
is
that
you
have
not
clearly
understood
what
i
want
to
i
admit
well
then
you
are
aware
that
underneath
the
apartments
set
for
madame
s
maids
of
honor
the
gentlemen
in
attendance
on
the
king
and
on
monsieur
are
yes
i
know
that
since
manicamp
de
wardes
and
others
are
living
precisely
well
monsieur
admire
the
singularity
of
the
circumstance
the
two
rooms
destined
for
de
guiche
are
exactly
the
very
two
rooms
situated
underneath
those
which
mademoiselle
de
montalais
and
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
well
what
then
what
then
do
you
say
why
these
two
rooms
are
empty
since
de
guiche
is
now
lying
wounded
at
i
assure
you
my
dear
fellow
i
can
not
grasp
your
well
if
i
had
the
happiness
to
call
myself
i
should
guess
and
what
would
you
do
then
i
should
at
once
change
the
rooms
i
am
occupying
here
for
those
which
de
guiche
is
not
using
can
you
suppose
such
a
thing
said
disdainfully
what
abandon
the
chief
post
of
honor
the
proximity
to
the
king
a
privilege
conceded
only
to
princes
of
the
blood
to
dukes
and
peers
permit
me
to
tell
you
my
dear
monsieur
de
malicorne
that
you
must
be
out
of
your
monsieur
replied
the
young
man
seriously
you
commit
two
mistakes
my
name
is
malicorne
simply
and
i
am
in
perfect
possession
of
all
my
then
drawing
a
paper
from
his
pocket
he
said
listen
to
what
i
am
going
to
say
and
afterwards
i
will
show
you
this
i
am
listening
said
you
know
that
madame
looks
after
la
valliere
as
carefully
as
argus
did
after
the
nymph
i
you
know
that
the
king
has
sought
for
an
opportunity
but
uselessly
of
speaking
to
the
prisoner
and
that
neither
you
nor
myself
have
yet
succeeded
in
procuring
him
this
piece
of
good
you
certainly
ought
to
know
something
about
the
subject
my
poor
malicorne
said
smiling
very
good
what
do
you
suppose
would
happen
to
the
man
whose
imagination
devised
some
means
of
bringing
the
lovers
together
oh
the
king
would
set
no
bounds
to
his
let
me
ask
you
then
de
whether
you
would
not
be
curious
to
taste
a
little
of
this
royal
gratitude
certainly
replied
any
favor
of
my
master
as
a
recognition
of
the
proper
discharge
of
my
duty
would
assuredly
be
most
in
that
case
look
at
this
paper
monsieur
le
what
is
it
a
plan
yes
a
plan
of
de
guiche
s
two
rooms
which
in
all
probability
will
soon
be
your
two
oh
no
whatever
may
why
so
because
my
rooms
are
the
envy
of
too
many
gentlemen
to
whom
i
certainly
shall
not
give
them
up
de
roquelaure
for
instance
de
la
ferte
and
de
dangeau
would
all
be
anxious
to
get
in
that
case
i
shall
leave
you
monsieur
le
comte
and
i
shall
go
and
offer
to
one
of
those
gentlemen
the
plan
i
have
just
shown
you
together
with
the
advantages
annexed
to
but
why
do
you
not
keep
them
for
yourself
inquired
suspiciously
because
the
king
would
never
do
me
the
honor
of
paying
me
a
visit
openly
whilst
he
would
readily
go
and
see
any
one
of
those
what
the
king
would
go
and
see
any
one
of
those
gentlemen
go
most
certainly
he
would
ten
times
instead
of
once
is
it
possible
you
can
ask
me
if
the
king
would
go
to
an
apartment
which
would
bring
him
nearer
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
yes
indeed
delightfully
near
her
with
a
floor
between
malicorne
unfolded
the
piece
of
paper
which
had
been
wrapped
round
the
bobbin
monsieur
le
comte
he
said
have
the
goodness
to
observe
that
the
flooring
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
room
is
merely
a
wooden
well
well
all
you
would
have
to
do
would
be
to
get
hold
of
a
journeyman
carpenter
lock
him
up
in
your
apartments
without
letting
him
know
where
you
have
taken
him
to
and
let
him
make
a
hole
in
your
ceiling
and
consequently
in
the
flooring
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
good
heavens
exclaimed
as
if
dazzled
what
is
the
matter
said
malicorne
nothing
except
that
you
have
hit
upon
a
singular
bold
idea
it
will
seem
a
very
trifling
one
to
the
king
i
assure
lovers
never
think
of
the
risk
they
what
danger
do
you
apprehend
monsieur
le
comte
why
effecting
such
an
opening
as
that
will
make
a
terrible
noise
it
could
be
heard
all
over
the
oh
monsieur
le
comte
i
am
quite
sure
that
the
carpenter
i
shall
select
will
not
make
the
slightest
noise
in
the
world
he
will
saw
an
opening
three
feet
square
with
a
saw
covered
with
tow
and
no
one
not
even
those
adjoining
will
know
that
he
is
at
my
dear
monsieur
malicorne
you
astound
you
positively
bewilder
to
continue
replied
malicorne
quietly
in
the
room
the
ceiling
of
which
you
will
have
cut
through
you
will
put
up
a
staircase
which
will
either
allow
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
to
descend
into
your
room
or
the
king
to
ascend
into
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
but
the
staircase
will
be
no
for
in
your
room
it
will
be
hidden
by
a
partition
over
which
you
will
throw
a
tapestry
similar
to
that
which
covers
the
rest
of
the
apartment
and
in
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
room
it
will
not
be
seen
for
the
trapdoor
which
will
be
a
part
of
the
flooring
itself
will
be
made
to
open
under
the
of
course
said
whose
eyes
began
to
sparkle
with
delight
and
now
monsieur
le
comte
there
is
no
occasion
to
make
you
admit
that
the
king
will
frequently
come
to
the
room
where
such
a
staircase
is
constructed
i
think
that
dangeau
particularly
will
be
struck
by
my
idea
and
i
shall
now
go
and
explain
to
but
my
dear
monsieur
malicorne
you
forget
that
you
spoke
to
me
about
it
the
first
and
that
i
have
consequently
the
right
of
do
you
wish
for
the
preference
do
i
wish
it
of
course
i
the
fact
is
monsieur
de
i
am
presenting
you
with
a
jacob
s
ladder
which
is
better
than
the
promise
of
an
additional
step
in
the
peerage
perhaps
even
with
a
good
estate
to
accompany
your
at
least
replied
it
will
give
me
an
opportunity
of
showing
the
king
that
he
is
not
mistaken
in
occasionally
calling
me
his
friend
an
opportunity
dear
malicorne
for
which
i
am
indebted
to
and
which
you
will
not
forget
to
remember
inquired
malicorne
smiling
nothing
will
delight
me
more
but
i
am
not
the
king
s
friend
i
am
simply
his
yes
and
if
you
imagine
that
that
staircase
is
as
good
as
a
dukedom
for
myself
i
think
there
will
certainly
be
letters
of
nobility
at
the
top
of
it
for
malicorne
bowed
all
i
have
to
do
now
said
is
to
move
as
soon
as
i
do
not
think
the
king
will
object
to
it
ask
his
permission
i
will
go
and
see
him
this
very
and
i
will
run
and
get
the
carpenter
i
was
speaking
when
will
he
be
here
this
very
do
not
forget
your
he
shall
be
brought
with
his
eyes
and
i
will
send
you
one
of
my
without
and
one
of
my
servants
without
livery
but
stay
what
will
la
valliere
say
if
she
sees
what
is
going
on
oh
i
can
assure
you
she
will
be
very
much
interested
in
the
operation
and
i
am
equally
sure
that
if
the
king
has
not
courage
enough
to
ascend
to
her
room
she
will
have
sufficient
curiosity
to
come
down
to
we
will
live
in
hope
said
and
now
i
am
off
to
his
majesty
at
what
time
will
the
carpenter
be
here
at
eight
o
how
long
do
you
suppose
he
will
take
to
make
this
opening
about
a
couple
of
hours
only
afterwards
he
must
have
sufficient
time
to
construct
what
may
be
called
the
hyphen
between
the
two
rooms
one
night
and
a
portion
of
the
following
day
will
do
we
must
not
reckon
upon
less
than
two
days
including
putting
up
the
two
days
that
is
a
very
long
nay
when
one
undertakes
to
open
up
communications
with
paradise
itself
we
must
at
least
take
care
that
the
approaches
are
quite
right
so
farewell
for
a
short
time
dear
malicorne
i
shall
begin
to
remove
the
day
after
in
the
chapter
xxxiv
the
promenade
by
torchlight
delighted
with
what
he
had
just
heard
and
rejoiced
at
what
the
future
foreshadowed
for
him
bent
his
steps
towards
de
guiche
s
two
rooms
he
who
a
quarter
of
an
hour
previously
would
hardly
yield
up
his
own
rooms
for
a
million
francs
was
now
ready
to
expend
a
million
if
it
were
necessary
upon
the
acquisition
of
the
two
happy
rooms
he
coveted
so
eagerly
but
he
did
not
meet
with
so
many
obstacles
de
guiche
did
not
yet
know
where
he
was
to
lodge
and
besides
was
still
too
far
ill
to
trouble
himself
about
his
lodgings
and
so
obtained
de
guiche
s
two
rooms
without
difficulty
as
for
dangeau
he
was
so
immeasurably
delighted
that
he
did
not
even
give
himself
the
trouble
to
think
whether
had
any
particular
reason
for
removing
within
an
hour
after
s
new
resolution
he
was
in
possession
of
the
two
rooms
and
ten
minutes
later
malicorne
entered
followed
by
the
upholsterers
during
this
time
the
king
asked
for
the
valet
ran
to
his
late
apartments
and
found
dangeau
there
dangeau
sent
him
on
to
de
guiche
s
and
was
found
there
but
a
little
delay
had
of
course
taken
place
and
the
king
had
already
exhibited
once
or
twice
evident
signs
of
impatience
when
entered
his
royal
master
s
presence
quite
out
of
breath
you
too
abandon
me
then
said
louis
in
a
similar
tone
of
lamentation
to
that
with
which
caesar
eighteen
hundred
years
previously
had
pronounced
the
tu
sire
i
am
far
from
abandoning
you
for
on
the
contrary
i
am
busily
occupied
in
changing
my
what
do
you
mean
i
thought
you
had
finished
moving
three
days
yes
sire
but
i
don
t
find
myself
comfortable
where
i
am
so
i
am
going
to
change
to
the
opposite
side
of
the
was
i
not
right
when
i
said
you
were
abandoning
me
exclaimed
the
king
oh
this
exceeds
all
endurance
but
so
it
is
there
was
only
one
woman
for
whom
my
heart
cared
at
all
and
all
my
family
is
leagued
together
to
tear
her
from
me
and
my
friend
to
whom
i
confided
my
distress
and
who
helped
me
to
bear
up
under
it
has
become
wearied
of
my
complaints
and
is
going
to
leave
me
without
even
asking
my
began
to
laugh
the
king
at
once
guessed
there
must
be
some
mystery
in
this
want
of
respect
what
is
it
cried
the
king
full
of
hope
this
sire
that
the
friend
whom
the
king
calumniates
is
going
to
try
if
he
can
not
restore
to
his
sovereign
the
happiness
he
has
are
you
going
to
let
me
see
la
valliere
said
louis
xiv
i
can
not
say
so
positively
but
i
hope
how
how
tell
me
that
i
wish
to
know
what
your
project
is
and
to
help
you
with
all
my
sire
replied
i
can
not
even
myself
tell
very
well
how
i
must
set
about
attaining
success
but
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
from
do
you
say
what
happiness
but
why
are
you
changing
your
rooms
in
order
to
serve
your
majesty
to
better
how
can
your
moving
serve
me
do
you
happen
to
know
where
the
two
rooms
destined
for
de
guiche
are
situated
well
your
majesty
now
knows
where
i
am
very
likely
but
that
does
not
help
what
is
it
possible
that
you
do
not
understand
sire
that
above
de
guiche
s
lodgings
are
two
rooms
one
of
which
is
mademoiselle
montalais
s
and
the
other
la
valliere
s
is
it
not
so
oh
yes
yes
it
is
a
brilliant
idea
a
true
friend
s
idea
a
poet
s
idea
by
bringing
me
nearer
her
from
whom
the
world
seems
to
unite
to
separate
me
you
are
far
more
than
pylades
was
for
orestes
or
patroclus
for
sire
said
aignan
with
a
smile
i
question
whether
if
your
majesty
were
to
know
my
projects
in
their
full
extent
you
would
continue
to
pronounce
such
a
pompous
eulogium
upon
me
ah
sire
i
know
how
very
different
are
the
epithets
which
certain
puritans
of
the
court
will
not
fail
to
apply
to
me
when
they
learn
of
what
i
intend
to
do
for
your
i
am
dying
with
impatience
i
am
in
a
perfect
fever
i
shall
never
be
able
to
wait
until
why
is
an
eternity
and
yet
sire
i
shall
require
you
if
you
please
to
go
out
presently
and
divert
your
impatience
by
a
good
with
you
agreed
we
will
talk
about
your
projects
we
will
talk
of
nay
sire
i
remain
whom
shall
i
go
out
with
then
with
the
queen
and
all
the
ladies
of
the
nothing
shall
induce
me
to
do
that
and
yet
sire
you
no
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
will
never
again
expose
myself
to
the
horrible
torture
of
being
close
to
her
of
seeing
her
of
touching
her
dress
as
i
pass
by
her
and
yet
not
be
able
to
say
a
word
to
her
no
i
renounce
a
torture
which
you
suppose
will
bring
me
happiness
but
which
consumes
and
eats
away
my
very
life
to
see
her
in
the
presence
of
strangers
and
not
to
tell
her
that
i
love
her
when
my
whole
being
reveals
my
affection
and
betrays
me
to
every
one
no
i
have
sworn
never
to
do
it
again
and
i
will
keep
my
yet
sire
pray
listen
to
me
for
a
i
will
listen
to
nothing
in
that
case
i
will
continue
it
is
most
urgent
sire
pray
understand
me
it
is
of
the
greatest
importance
that
madame
and
her
maids
of
honor
should
be
absent
for
two
hours
from
the
i
can
not
understand
your
meaning
at
all
it
is
hard
for
me
to
give
my
sovereign
directions
what
to
do
but
under
the
circumstances
i
do
give
you
directions
sire
and
either
a
hunting
or
a
promenade
party
must
be
got
but
if
i
were
to
do
what
you
wish
it
would
be
a
caprice
a
mere
whim
in
displaying
such
an
impatient
humor
i
show
my
whole
court
that
i
have
no
control
over
my
own
feelings
do
not
people
already
say
that
i
am
dreaming
of
the
conquest
of
the
world
but
that
i
ought
previously
to
begin
by
achieving
a
conquest
over
myself
those
who
say
so
sire
are
as
insolent
as
they
would
like
to
be
thought
facetious
but
whomever
they
may
be
if
your
majesty
prefers
to
listen
to
them
i
have
nothing
further
to
say
in
such
a
case
that
which
we
have
fixed
to
take
place
must
be
postponed
nay
i
will
go
out
this
evening
i
will
go
by
torchlight
to
i
will
breakfast
there
and
will
return
to
paris
by
three
o
clock
will
that
do
in
that
case
i
will
set
out
this
evening
at
eight
o
your
majesty
has
fixed
upon
the
exact
and
you
positively
will
tell
me
nothing
more
it
is
because
i
have
nothing
more
to
tell
you
industry
counts
for
something
in
this
world
sire
but
still
chance
plays
so
important
a
part
in
it
that
i
have
been
accustomed
to
leave
her
the
sidewalk
confident
that
she
will
manage
so
as
to
always
take
the
well
i
abandon
myself
entirely
to
and
you
are
quite
comforted
in
this
manner
the
king
went
immediately
to
madame
to
whom
he
announced
the
intended
expedition
madame
fancied
at
the
first
moment
that
she
saw
in
this
unexpectedly
arranged
party
a
plot
of
the
king
s
to
converse
with
la
valliere
either
on
the
road
under
cover
of
the
darkness
or
in
some
other
way
but
she
took
especial
care
not
to
show
any
of
her
fancies
to
her
and
accepted
the
invitation
with
a
smile
upon
her
lips
she
gave
directions
aloud
that
her
maids
of
honor
should
accompany
her
secretly
intending
in
the
evening
to
take
the
most
effectual
steps
to
interfere
with
his
majesty
s
attachment
then
when
she
was
alone
and
at
the
very
moment
the
poor
lover
who
had
issued
orders
for
the
departure
was
reveling
in
the
idea
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
would
form
one
of
the
party
luxuriating
in
the
sad
happiness
persecuted
lovers
enjoy
of
realizing
through
the
sense
of
sight
alone
all
the
transports
of
possession
madame
who
was
surrounded
by
her
maids
of
honor
was
saying
two
ladies
will
be
enough
for
me
this
evening
mademoiselle
de
and
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
had
anticipated
her
own
omission
and
was
prepared
for
it
but
persecution
had
rendered
her
courageous
and
she
did
not
give
madame
the
pleasure
of
seeing
on
her
face
the
impression
of
the
shock
her
heart
received
on
the
contrary
smiling
with
that
ineffable
gentleness
which
gave
an
angelic
expression
to
her
features
in
that
case
madame
i
shall
be
at
liberty
this
evening
i
suppose
she
said
of
i
shall
be
able
to
employ
it
then
in
progressing
with
that
piece
of
tapestry
which
your
highness
has
been
good
enough
to
notice
and
which
i
have
already
had
the
honor
of
offering
to
and
having
made
a
respectful
obeisance
she
withdrew
to
her
own
apartment
mesdemoiselles
de
and
de
montalais
did
the
same
the
rumor
of
the
intended
promenade
soon
spread
all
over
the
palace
ten
minutes
afterwards
malicorne
learned
madame
s
resolution
and
slipped
under
montalais
s
door
a
note
in
the
following
terms
l
must
positively
pass
the
night
the
night
with
montalais
in
pursuance
of
the
compact
she
had
entered
into
began
by
burning
the
letter
and
then
sat
down
to
reflect
montalais
was
a
girl
full
of
expedients
and
so
she
very
soon
arranged
her
plan
towards
five
o
clock
which
was
the
hour
for
her
to
repair
to
madame
s
apartment
she
was
running
across
the
courtyard
and
had
reached
within
a
dozen
paces
of
a
group
of
officers
when
she
uttered
a
cry
fell
gracefully
on
one
knee
rose
again
with
difficulty
and
walked
on
limpingly
the
gentlemen
ran
forward
to
her
assistance
montalais
had
sprained
her
foot
faithful
to
the
discharge
of
her
duty
she
insisted
however
notwithstanding
her
accident
upon
going
to
madame
s
apartments
what
is
the
matter
and
why
do
you
limp
so
she
inquired
i
mistook
you
for
la
montalais
related
how
it
had
happened
that
in
hurrying
on
in
order
to
arrive
as
quickly
as
possible
she
had
sprained
her
foot
madame
seemed
to
pity
her
and
wished
to
have
a
surgeon
sent
for
immediately
but
she
assuring
her
that
there
was
nothing
really
serious
in
the
accident
said
my
only
regret
madame
is
that
it
will
preclude
my
attendance
on
you
and
i
should
have
begged
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
to
take
my
place
with
your
royal
highness
but
seeing
that
madame
frowned
she
added
i
have
not
done
why
did
you
not
do
so
inquired
madame
because
poor
la
valliere
seemed
so
happy
to
have
her
liberty
for
a
whole
evening
and
night
too
that
i
did
not
feel
courageous
enough
to
ask
her
to
take
my
what
is
she
so
delighted
as
that
inquired
madame
struck
by
these
words
she
is
wild
with
delight
she
who
is
always
so
melancholy
was
singing
like
a
bird
besides
your
highness
knows
how
much
she
detests
going
out
and
also
that
her
character
has
a
spice
of
wildness
in
so
thought
madame
this
extreme
delight
hardly
seems
natural
to
she
has
already
made
all
her
preparations
for
dining
in
her
own
room
with
one
of
her
favorite
books
and
then
as
your
highness
has
six
other
young
ladies
who
would
be
delighted
to
accompany
you
i
did
not
make
my
proposal
to
la
madame
did
not
say
a
word
in
reply
have
i
acted
properly
continued
montalais
with
a
slight
fluttering
of
the
heart
seeing
the
little
success
that
seemed
to
attend
the
de
which
she
had
relied
upon
with
so
much
confidence
that
she
had
not
thought
it
even
necessary
to
try
and
find
another
does
madame
approve
of
what
i
have
done
she
continued
madame
was
reflecting
that
the
king
could
very
easily
leave
during
the
night
and
that
as
it
was
only
four
leagues
and
a
half
from
paris
to
he
might
readily
be
in
paris
in
an
hour
s
time
tell
me
she
said
whether
la
valliere
when
she
heard
of
your
accident
offered
at
least
to
bear
you
company
oh
she
does
not
yet
know
of
my
accident
but
even
did
she
know
of
it
i
most
certainly
should
not
ask
her
to
do
anything
that
might
interfere
with
her
own
plans
i
think
she
wishes
this
evening
to
realize
quietly
by
herself
that
amusement
of
the
late
king
when
he
said
to
de
let
us
amuse
ourselves
by
doing
nothing
and
making
ourselves
madame
felt
convinced
that
some
mysterious
love
adventure
lurked
behind
this
strong
desire
for
solitude
the
secret
be
louis
s
return
during
the
night
it
could
not
be
doubted
any
longer
la
valliere
had
been
informed
of
his
intended
return
and
that
was
the
reason
for
her
delight
at
having
to
remain
behind
at
the
palais
royal
it
was
a
plan
settled
and
arranged
beforehand
i
will
not
be
their
dupe
though
said
madame
and
she
took
a
decisive
step
mademoiselle
de
montalais
she
said
will
you
have
the
goodness
to
inform
your
friend
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
that
i
am
exceedingly
sorry
to
disarrange
her
projects
of
solitude
but
that
instead
of
becoming
by
remaining
behind
alone
as
she
wished
she
will
be
good
enough
to
accompany
us
to
and
get
ah
poor
la
valliere
said
montalais
compassionately
but
with
her
heart
throbbing
with
delight
oh
madame
could
there
not
be
some
means
enough
said
madame
i
desire
it
i
prefer
mademoiselle
la
baume
le
blanc
s
society
to
that
of
any
one
else
go
and
send
her
to
me
and
take
care
of
your
montalais
did
not
wait
for
the
order
to
be
repeated
she
returned
to
her
room
almost
forgetting
to
feign
lameness
wrote
an
answer
to
malicorne
and
slipped
it
under
the
carpet
the
answer
simply
said
she
a
spartan
could
not
have
written
more
laconically
by
this
means
thought
madame
i
will
look
narrowly
after
all
on
the
road
she
shall
sleep
near
me
during
the
night
and
his
majesty
must
be
very
clever
if
he
can
exchange
a
single
word
with
mademoiselle
de
la
la
valliere
received
the
order
to
set
off
with
the
same
indifferent
gentleness
with
which
she
had
received
the
order
to
play
cinderella
but
inwardly
her
delight
was
extreme
and
she
looked
upon
this
change
in
the
princess
s
resolution
as
a
consolation
which
providence
had
sent
her
with
less
penetration
than
madame
possessed
she
attributed
all
to
chance
while
every
one
with
the
exception
of
those
in
disgrace
of
those
who
were
ill
and
those
who
were
suffering
from
sprains
were
being
driven
towards
malicorne
smuggled
his
workman
into
the
palace
in
one
of
de
s
carriages
and
led
him
into
the
room
corresponding
to
la
valliere
s
the
man
set
to
work
with
a
will
tempted
by
the
splendid
reward
which
had
been
promised
him
as
the
very
best
tools
and
implements
had
been
selected
from
the
reserve
stock
belonging
to
the
engineers
attached
to
the
king
s
household
and
among
others
a
saw
with
teeth
so
sharp
and
well
tempered
that
it
was
able
under
water
even
to
cut
through
oaken
joists
as
hard
as
iron
the
work
in
question
advanced
very
rapidly
and
a
square
portion
of
the
ceiling
taken
from
between
two
of
the
joists
fell
into
the
arms
of
the
delighted
malicorne
the
workman
and
a
confidential
valet
the
latter
being
one
brought
into
the
world
to
see
and
hear
everything
but
to
repeat
nothing
in
accordance
with
a
new
plan
indicated
by
malicorne
the
opening
was
effected
in
an
angle
of
the
room
and
for
this
reason
as
there
was
no
adjoining
la
valliere
s
room
she
had
solicited
and
had
that
very
morning
obtained
a
large
screen
intended
to
serve
as
a
partition
the
screen
that
had
been
allotted
her
was
perfectly
sufficient
to
conceal
the
opening
which
would
besides
be
hidden
by
all
the
artifices
skilled
would
have
at
their
command
the
opening
having
been
made
the
workman
glided
between
the
joists
and
found
himself
in
la
valliere
s
room
when
there
he
cut
a
square
opening
in
the
flooring
and
out
of
the
boards
he
manufactured
a
trap
so
accurately
fitting
into
the
opening
that
the
most
practised
eye
could
hardly
detect
the
necessary
interstices
made
by
its
lines
of
juncture
with
the
floor
malicorne
had
provided
for
everything
a
ring
and
a
couple
of
hinges
which
had
been
bought
for
the
purpose
were
affixed
to
the
and
a
small
circular
packed
in
sections
had
been
bought
ready
made
by
the
industrious
malicorne
who
had
paid
two
thousand
francs
for
it
it
was
higher
than
what
was
required
but
the
carpenter
reduced
the
number
of
steps
and
it
was
found
to
suit
exactly
this
staircase
destined
to
receive
so
illustrious
a
burden
was
merely
fastened
to
the
wall
by
a
couple
of
iron
clamps
and
its
base
was
fixed
into
the
floor
of
the
comte
s
room
by
two
iron
pegs
screwed
down
tightly
so
that
the
king
and
all
his
cabinet
councilors
too
might
pass
up
and
down
the
staircase
without
any
fear
every
blow
of
the
hammer
fell
upon
a
thick
pad
or
cushion
and
the
saw
was
not
used
until
the
handle
had
been
wrapped
in
wool
and
the
blade
steeped
in
oil
the
noisiest
part
of
the
work
moreover
had
taken
place
during
the
night
and
early
in
the
morning
that
is
to
say
when
la
valliere
and
madame
were
both
absent
when
about
two
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
the
court
returned
to
the
palais
royal
la
valliere
went
up
into
her
own
room
everything
was
in
its
proper
place
not
the
smallest
particle
of
sawdust
not
the
smallest
chip
was
left
to
bear
witness
to
the
violation
of
her
domicile
however
wishing
to
do
his
utmost
in
forwarding
the
work
had
torn
his
fingers
and
his
shirt
too
and
had
expended
no
ordinary
amount
of
perspiration
in
the
king
s
service
the
palms
of
his
hands
were
covered
with
blisters
occasioned
by
his
having
held
the
ladder
for
malicorne
he
had
moreover
brought
up
one
by
one
the
seven
pieces
of
the
staircase
each
consisting
of
two
steps
in
fact
we
can
safely
assert
that
if
the
king
had
seen
him
so
ardently
at
work
his
majesty
would
have
sworn
an
eternal
gratitude
towards
his
faithful
attendant
as
malicorne
anticipated
the
workman
had
completely
finished
the
job
in
hours
he
received
louis
and
left
overwhelmed
with
delight
for
he
had
gained
in
one
day
as
much
as
six
months
hard
work
would
have
procured
him
no
one
had
the
slightest
suspicion
of
what
had
taken
place
in
the
room
under
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
apartment
but
in
the
evening
of
the
second
day
at
the
very
moment
la
valliere
had
just
left
madame
s
circle
and
returned
to
her
own
room
she
heard
a
slight
creaking
sound
in
one
corner
astonished
she
looked
to
see
whence
it
proceeded
and
the
noise
began
again
who
is
there
she
said
in
a
tone
of
alarm
it
is
i
louise
replied
the
voice
of
the
king
you
you
cried
the
young
girl
who
for
a
moment
fancied
herself
under
the
influence
of
a
dream
but
where
you
sire
here
replied
the
king
opening
one
of
the
folds
of
the
screen
and
appearing
like
a
ghost
at
the
end
of
the
room
la
valliere
uttered
a
loud
cry
and
fell
trembling
into
an
armchair
as
the
king
advanced
respectfully
towards
her
chapter
xxxv
the
apparition
la
valliere
very
soon
recovered
from
her
surprise
for
owing
to
his
respectful
bearing
the
king
inspired
her
with
more
confidence
by
his
presence
than
his
sudden
appearance
had
deprived
her
of
but
as
he
noticed
that
which
made
la
valliere
most
uneasy
was
the
means
by
which
he
had
effected
an
entrance
into
her
room
he
explained
to
her
the
system
of
the
staircase
concealed
by
the
screen
and
strongly
disavowed
the
notion
of
his
being
a
supernatural
appearance
oh
sire
said
la
valliere
shaking
her
fair
head
with
a
most
engaging
smile
present
or
absent
you
do
not
appear
to
my
mind
more
at
one
time
than
at
which
means
louise
oh
what
you
know
so
well
sire
that
there
is
not
one
moment
in
which
the
poor
girl
whose
secret
you
surprised
at
fontainebleau
and
whom
you
came
to
snatch
from
the
foot
of
the
cross
itself
does
not
think
of
louise
you
overwhelm
me
with
joy
and
la
valliere
smiled
mournfully
and
continued
but
sire
have
you
reflected
that
your
ingenious
invention
could
not
be
of
the
slightest
service
to
us
why
so
tell
me
i
am
waiting
most
because
this
room
may
be
subject
to
being
searched
at
any
moment
of
the
day
madame
herself
may
at
any
time
come
here
accidentally
my
companions
run
in
at
any
moment
they
please
to
fasten
the
door
on
the
inside
is
to
denounce
myself
as
plainly
as
if
i
had
written
above
no
admittance
the
king
is
within
even
now
sire
at
this
very
moment
there
is
nothing
to
prevent
the
door
opening
and
your
majesty
being
seen
in
that
case
said
the
king
laughingly
i
should
indeed
be
taken
for
a
phantom
for
no
one
can
tell
in
what
way
i
came
here
besides
it
is
only
spirits
that
can
pass
through
brick
walls
or
floors
and
oh
sire
reflect
for
a
moment
how
terrible
the
scandal
would
be
nothing
equal
to
it
could
ever
have
been
previously
said
about
the
maids
of
honor
poor
creatures
whom
evil
report
however
hardly
ever
and
your
conclusion
from
all
this
my
dear
louise
come
explain
alas
it
is
a
hard
thing
to
say
but
your
majesty
must
suppress
staircase
plots
surprises
and
all
for
the
evil
consequences
which
would
result
from
your
being
found
here
would
be
far
greater
than
our
happiness
in
seeing
each
well
louise
replied
the
king
tenderly
instead
of
removing
this
staircase
by
which
i
have
ascended
there
is
a
far
more
simple
means
of
which
you
have
not
a
means
another
means
yes
another
oh
you
do
not
love
me
as
i
love
you
louise
since
my
invention
is
quicker
than
she
looked
at
the
king
who
held
out
his
hand
to
her
which
she
took
and
gently
pressed
between
her
own
you
were
saying
continued
the
king
that
i
shall
be
detected
coming
here
where
any
one
who
pleases
can
stay
sire
at
this
very
moment
even
while
you
are
speaking
about
it
i
tremble
with
dread
of
your
being
but
you
would
not
be
found
out
louise
if
you
were
to
descend
the
staircase
which
leads
to
the
room
oh
sire
what
do
you
say
cried
louise
in
alarm
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
louise
since
you
get
offended
at
my
very
first
word
first
of
all
do
you
know
to
whom
the
apartments
underneath
belong
to
de
guiche
sire
i
not
at
all
they
are
de
are
you
sure
cried
la
valliere
and
this
exclamation
which
escaped
from
the
young
girl
s
joyous
heart
made
the
king
s
heart
throb
with
delight
yes
to
he
said
but
sire
returned
la
valliere
i
can
not
visit
de
s
rooms
any
more
than
i
could
de
guiche
s
it
is
impossible
and
yet
louise
i
should
have
thought
that
under
the
of
the
king
you
would
venture
under
the
of
the
king
she
said
with
a
look
full
of
tenderness
you
have
faith
in
my
word
i
hope
louise
yes
sire
when
you
are
not
present
but
when
you
are
present
when
you
speak
to
me
when
i
look
upon
you
i
have
faith
in
what
can
possibly
be
done
to
reassure
you
it
is
scarcely
respectful
i
know
to
doubt
the
king
but
for
me
you
are
the
thank
heaven
i
at
least
hope
so
most
devoutly
you
see
how
anxiously
i
am
trying
to
find
or
invent
a
means
of
removing
all
difficulty
stay
would
the
presence
of
a
third
person
reassure
you
the
presence
of
de
would
really
louise
you
wound
me
by
your
louise
did
not
answer
she
merely
looked
steadfastly
at
him
with
that
clear
piercing
gaze
which
penetrates
the
very
heart
and
said
softly
to
herself
alas
alas
it
is
not
you
of
whom
i
am
afraid
it
is
not
you
upon
whom
my
doubts
would
well
said
the
king
sighing
i
agree
and
de
who
enjoys
the
inestimable
privilege
of
reassuring
you
shall
always
be
present
at
our
interviews
i
promise
you
promise
that
sire
upon
my
honor
as
a
gentleman
and
you
on
your
side
oh
wait
sire
that
is
not
all
yet
for
such
conversations
ought
at
least
to
have
a
reasonable
motive
of
some
kind
for
de
dear
louise
every
shade
of
delicacy
of
feeling
is
yours
and
my
only
study
is
to
equal
you
on
that
point
it
shall
be
just
as
you
wish
therefore
our
conversations
shall
have
a
reasonable
motive
and
i
have
already
hit
upon
one
so
that
from
if
you
like
do
you
meant
that
that
is
not
soon
enough
exclaimed
the
king
caressing
la
valliere
s
hand
between
his
own
at
this
moment
the
sound
of
steps
was
heard
in
the
corridor
sire
sire
cried
la
valliere
some
one
is
coming
do
you
hear
oh
fly
fly
i
implore
the
king
made
but
one
bound
from
the
chair
where
he
was
sitting
to
his
behind
the
screen
he
had
barely
time
for
as
he
drew
one
of
the
folds
before
him
the
handle
of
the
door
was
turned
and
montalais
appeared
at
the
threshold
as
a
matter
of
course
she
entered
quite
naturally
and
without
any
ceremony
for
she
knew
perfectly
well
that
to
knock
at
the
door
beforehand
would
be
showing
a
suspicion
towards
la
valliere
which
would
be
displeasing
to
her
she
accordingly
entered
and
after
a
rapid
glance
round
the
room
in
the
brief
course
of
which
she
observed
two
chairs
very
close
to
each
other
she
was
so
long
in
shutting
the
door
which
seemed
to
be
difficult
to
close
one
can
hardly
tell
how
or
why
that
the
king
had
ample
time
to
raise
the
and
to
descend
again
to
s
room
louise
she
said
to
her
i
want
to
talk
to
you
and
seriously
good
heavens
my
dear
aure
what
is
the
matter
now
the
matter
is
that
madame
suspects
explain
is
there
any
occasion
for
us
to
enter
into
explanations
and
do
you
not
understand
what
i
mean
come
you
must
have
noticed
the
fluctuations
in
madame
s
humor
during
several
days
past
you
must
have
noticed
how
she
first
kept
you
close
beside
her
then
dismissed
you
and
then
sent
for
you
yes
i
have
noticed
it
of
well
it
seems
madame
has
now
succeeded
in
obtaining
sufficient
information
for
she
has
now
gone
straight
to
the
point
as
there
is
nothing
further
left
in
france
to
withstand
the
torrent
which
sweeps
away
all
obstacles
before
it
you
know
what
i
mean
by
the
torrent
la
valliere
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
i
mean
continued
montalais
pitilessly
that
torrent
which
burst
through
the
gates
of
the
carmelites
of
chaillot
and
overthrew
all
the
prejudices
of
the
court
as
well
at
fontainebleau
as
at
alas
alas
murmured
la
valliere
her
face
still
covered
by
her
hands
and
her
tears
streaming
through
her
fingers
oh
don
t
distress
yourself
in
that
manner
or
you
have
only
heard
half
of
your
in
heaven
s
name
exclaimed
the
young
girl
in
great
anxiety
what
is
the
matter
well
then
this
is
how
the
matter
stands
madame
who
can
no
longer
rely
upon
any
further
assistance
in
france
for
she
has
one
after
the
other
made
use
of
the
two
queens
of
monsieur
and
the
whole
court
too
now
bethinks
herself
of
a
certain
person
who
has
certain
pretended
rights
over
la
valliere
became
as
white
as
a
marble
statue
this
person
continued
madame
is
not
in
paris
at
this
moment
but
if
i
am
not
mistaken
is
just
now
in
yes
yes
breathed
la
valliere
almost
overwhelmed
with
terror
and
is
to
be
found
i
think
at
the
court
of
charles
ii
am
i
right
well
this
evening
a
letter
has
been
dispatched
by
madame
to
saint
james
s
with
directions
for
the
courier
to
go
straight
to
hampton
court
which
i
believe
is
one
of
the
royal
residences
situated
about
a
dozen
miles
from
yes
well
well
as
madame
writes
regularly
to
london
once
a
fortnight
and
as
the
ordinary
courier
left
for
london
not
more
than
three
days
ago
i
have
been
thinking
that
some
serious
circumstance
alone
could
have
induced
her
to
write
again
so
soon
for
you
know
she
is
a
very
indolent
this
letter
has
been
written
therefore
something
tells
me
so
at
least
on
your
on
my
account
repeated
the
unhappy
girl
mechanically
and
i
who
saw
the
letter
lying
on
madame
s
desk
before
she
sealed
it
fancied
i
could
read
what
did
you
fancy
you
could
read
i
might
possibly
have
been
mistaken
though
tell
me
what
was
it
the
name
of
la
valliere
rose
hurriedly
from
her
chair
a
prey
to
the
most
painful
agitation
montalais
she
said
her
voice
broken
by
sobs
all
my
smiling
dreams
of
youth
and
innocence
have
fled
already
i
have
nothing
now
to
conceal
either
from
you
or
any
one
else
my
life
is
exposed
to
every
one
s
inspection
and
can
be
opened
like
a
book
in
which
all
the
world
can
read
from
the
king
himself
to
the
first
aure
dearest
aure
what
can
i
do
what
will
become
of
me
montalais
approached
close
to
her
and
said
consult
your
own
heart
of
well
i
do
not
love
de
bragelonne
when
i
say
i
do
not
love
him
understand
that
i
love
him
as
the
most
affectionate
sister
could
love
the
best
of
brothers
but
that
is
not
what
he
requires
nor
what
i
promised
in
fact
you
love
the
king
said
montalais
and
that
is
a
sufficiently
good
yes
i
do
love
the
king
hoarsely
murmured
the
young
girl
and
i
have
paid
dearly
enough
for
pronouncing
those
words
and
now
montalais
tell
me
what
can
you
do
either
for
me
or
against
me
in
my
position
you
must
speak
more
clearly
what
am
i
to
say
then
and
so
you
have
nothing
very
particular
to
tell
me
no
said
louise
in
astonishment
very
good
and
so
all
you
have
to
ask
me
is
my
advice
respecting
raoul
nothing
it
is
a
very
delicate
subject
replied
montalais
no
it
is
nothing
of
the
kind
ought
i
to
marry
him
in
order
to
keep
the
promise
i
made
or
ought
i
continue
to
listen
to
the
king
you
have
really
placed
me
in
a
very
difficult
position
said
montalais
smiling
you
ask
me
if
you
ought
to
marry
raoul
whose
friend
i
am
and
whom
i
shall
mortally
offend
in
giving
my
opinion
against
him
and
then
you
ask
me
if
you
should
cease
to
listen
to
the
king
whose
subject
i
am
and
whom
i
should
offend
if
i
were
to
advise
you
in
a
particular
way
ah
louise
you
seem
to
hold
a
difficult
position
at
a
very
cheap
you
have
not
understood
me
aure
said
la
valliere
wounded
by
the
slightly
mocking
tone
of
her
companion
if
i
were
to
marry
de
bragelonne
i
should
be
far
from
bestowing
on
him
the
happiness
he
deserves
but
for
the
same
reason
if
i
listen
to
the
king
he
would
become
the
possessor
of
one
indifferent
in
very
many
aspects
i
admit
but
one
whom
his
affection
confers
an
appearance
of
value
what
i
ask
you
then
is
to
tell
me
some
means
of
disengaging
myself
honorably
either
from
the
one
or
from
the
other
or
rather
i
ask
you
from
which
side
you
think
i
can
free
myself
most
my
dear
louise
replied
montalais
after
a
pause
i
am
not
one
of
the
seven
wise
men
of
greece
and
i
have
no
perfectly
invariable
rules
of
conduct
to
govern
me
but
on
the
other
hand
i
have
a
little
experience
and
i
can
assure
you
that
no
woman
ever
asks
for
advice
of
the
nature
which
you
have
just
asked
me
without
being
in
a
terrible
state
of
embarrassment
besides
you
have
made
a
solemn
promise
which
every
principle
of
honor
requires
you
to
fulfil
if
therefore
you
are
embarrassed
in
consequence
of
having
undertaken
such
an
engagement
it
is
not
a
stranger
s
advice
every
one
is
a
stranger
to
a
heart
full
of
love
it
is
not
my
advice
i
repeat
that
can
extricate
you
from
your
embarrassment
i
shall
not
give
it
you
therefore
and
for
a
greater
reason
still
because
were
i
in
your
place
i
should
feel
much
more
embarrassed
after
the
advice
than
before
it
all
i
can
do
is
to
repeat
what
i
have
already
told
you
shall
i
assist
you
yes
very
well
that
is
all
tell
me
in
what
way
you
wish
me
to
help
you
tell
me
for
and
against
whom
in
this
way
we
shall
not
make
any
but
first
of
all
said
la
valliere
pressing
her
companion
s
hand
for
whom
or
against
whom
do
you
decide
for
you
if
you
are
really
and
truly
my
are
you
not
madame
s
confidant
a
greater
reason
for
being
of
service
to
you
if
i
were
not
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
that
direction
i
should
not
be
of
any
service
at
all
and
consequently
you
would
not
obtain
any
advantage
from
my
acquaintance
friendships
live
and
thrive
upon
a
system
of
reciprocal
the
result
is
then
that
you
will
remain
at
the
same
time
madame
s
friend
also
evidently
do
you
complain
of
that
i
hardly
know
sighed
la
valliere
thoughtfully
for
this
cynical
frankness
appeared
to
her
an
offense
both
to
the
woman
and
the
friend
all
well
and
good
then
said
montalais
for
if
you
did
you
would
be
very
you
wish
to
serve
me
then
devotedly
if
you
will
serve
me
in
one
would
almost
say
that
you
do
not
know
my
heart
said
la
valliere
looking
at
montalais
with
her
eyes
wide
open
why
the
fact
is
that
since
we
have
belonged
to
the
court
my
dear
louise
we
are
very
much
in
what
way
it
is
very
simple
were
you
the
second
queen
of
france
yonder
at
blois
la
valliere
hung
down
her
head
and
began
to
weep
montalais
looked
at
her
in
an
indefinable
manner
and
murmured
poor
girl
and
then
adding
poor
king
she
kissed
louise
on
the
forehead
and
returned
to
her
apartment
where
malicorne
was
waiting
for
her
chapter
xxxvi
the
portrait
in
that
malady
which
is
termed
love
the
paroxysms
succeed
each
other
at
intervals
ever
accelerating
from
the
moment
the
disease
declares
itself
by
and
by
the
paroxysms
are
less
frequent
in
proportion
as
the
cure
approaches
this
being
laid
down
as
a
general
axiom
and
as
the
leading
article
of
a
particular
chapter
we
will
now
proceed
with
our
recital
the
next
day
the
day
fixed
by
the
king
for
the
first
conversation
in
s
room
la
valliere
on
opening
one
of
the
folds
of
the
screen
found
upon
the
floor
a
letter
in
the
king
s
handwriting
the
letter
had
been
passed
through
a
slit
in
the
floor
from
the
lower
apartment
to
her
own
no
indiscreet
hand
or
curious
gaze
could
have
brought
or
did
bring
this
single
paper
this
too
was
one
of
malicorne
s
ideas
having
seen
how
very
serviceable
would
become
to
the
king
on
account
of
his
apartment
he
did
not
wish
that
the
courtier
should
become
still
more
indispensable
as
a
messenger
and
so
he
had
on
his
own
private
account
reserved
this
last
post
for
himself
la
valliere
most
eagerly
read
the
letter
which
fixed
two
o
clock
that
same
afternoon
for
the
rendezvous
and
which
indicated
the
way
of
raising
the
which
was
constructed
out
of
the
flooring
make
yourself
look
as
beautiful
as
you
can
added
the
postscript
of
the
letter
words
which
astonished
the
young
girl
but
at
the
same
time
reassured
her
the
hours
passed
away
very
slowly
but
the
time
fixed
however
arrived
at
last
as
punctual
as
the
priestess
hero
louise
lifted
up
the
at
the
last
stroke
of
the
hour
of
two
and
found
the
king
on
the
steps
waiting
for
her
with
the
greatest
respect
in
order
to
give
her
his
hand
to
descend
the
delicacy
and
deference
shown
in
this
attention
affected
her
very
powerfully
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
the
two
lovers
found
the
comte
who
with
a
smile
and
a
low
reverence
distinguished
by
the
best
taste
expressed
his
thanks
to
la
valliere
for
the
honor
she
conferred
upon
him
then
turning
towards
the
king
he
said
sire
our
man
is
la
valliere
looked
at
the
king
with
some
uneasiness
mademoiselle
said
the
king
if
i
have
begged
you
to
do
me
the
honor
of
coming
down
here
it
was
from
an
interested
motive
i
have
procured
a
most
admirable
portrait
painter
who
is
celebrated
for
the
fidelity
of
his
likenesses
and
i
wish
you
to
be
kind
enough
to
authorize
him
to
paint
yours
besides
if
you
positively
wish
it
the
portrait
shall
remain
in
your
own
la
valliere
blushed
you
see
said
the
king
to
her
we
shall
not
be
three
as
you
wished
but
four
instead
and
so
long
as
we
are
not
alone
there
can
be
as
many
present
as
you
la
valliere
gently
pressed
her
royal
lover
s
hand
shall
we
pass
into
the
next
room
sire
said
opening
the
door
to
let
his
guests
precede
him
the
king
walked
behind
la
valliere
and
fixed
his
eyes
lingeringly
and
passionately
upon
that
neck
as
white
as
snow
upon
which
her
long
fair
ringlets
fell
in
heavy
masses
la
valliere
was
dressed
in
a
thick
silk
robe
of
pearl
gray
color
with
a
tinge
of
rose
with
jet
ornaments
which
displayed
to
greater
effect
the
dazzling
purity
of
her
skin
holding
in
her
slender
and
transparent
hands
a
bouquet
of
heartsease
bengal
roses
and
clematis
surrounded
with
leaves
of
the
tenderest
green
above
which
uprose
like
a
tiny
goblet
spilling
magic
influence
a
haarlem
tulip
of
gray
and
violet
tints
of
a
pure
and
beautiful
species
which
had
cost
the
gardener
five
years
toil
of
combinations
and
the
king
five
thousand
francs
louis
had
placed
this
bouquet
in
la
valliere
s
hand
as
he
saluted
her
in
the
room
the
door
of
which
had
just
opened
a
young
man
was
standing
dressed
in
a
purple
velvet
jacket
with
beautiful
black
eyes
and
long
brown
hair
it
was
the
painter
his
canvas
was
quite
ready
and
his
palette
prepared
for
use
he
bowed
to
la
valliere
with
the
grave
curiosity
of
an
artist
who
is
studying
his
model
saluted
the
king
discreetly
as
if
he
did
not
recognize
him
and
as
he
would
consequently
have
saluted
any
other
gentleman
then
leading
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
to
the
seat
he
had
arranged
for
her
he
begged
her
to
sit
down
the
young
girl
assumed
an
attitude
graceful
and
unrestrained
her
hands
occupied
and
her
limbs
reclining
on
cushions
and
in
order
that
her
gaze
might
not
assume
a
vague
or
affected
expression
the
painter
begged
her
to
choose
some
kind
of
occupation
so
as
to
engage
her
attention
whereupon
louis
smiling
sat
down
on
the
cushions
at
la
valliere
s
feet
so
that
she
in
the
reclining
posture
she
had
assumed
leaning
back
in
the
armchair
holding
her
flowers
in
her
hand
and
he
with
his
eyes
raised
towards
her
and
fixed
devouringly
on
her
face
they
both
together
formed
so
charming
a
group
that
the
artist
contemplated
painting
it
with
professional
delight
while
on
his
side
regarded
them
with
feelings
of
envy
the
painter
sketched
rapidly
and
very
soon
beneath
the
earliest
touches
of
the
brush
there
started
into
life
out
of
the
gray
background
the
gentle
face
with
its
soft
calm
eyes
and
delicately
tinted
cheeks
enframed
in
the
masses
of
hair
which
fell
about
her
neck
the
lovers
however
spoke
but
little
and
looked
at
each
other
a
great
deal
sometimes
their
eyes
became
so
languishing
in
their
gaze
that
the
painter
was
obliged
to
interrupt
his
work
in
order
to
avoid
representing
an
erycina
instead
of
la
valliere
it
was
on
such
occasions
that
came
to
the
rescue
and
recited
verses
or
repeated
one
of
those
little
tales
such
as
patru
related
and
tallemant
des
reaux
wrote
so
cleverly
or
it
might
be
that
la
valliere
was
fatigued
and
the
sitting
was
therefore
suspended
for
awhile
and
immediately
a
tray
of
precious
porcelain
laden
with
the
most
beautiful
fruits
which
could
be
obtained
and
rich
wines
distilling
their
bright
colors
in
silver
goblets
beautifully
chased
served
as
accessories
to
the
picture
of
which
the
painter
could
but
retrace
the
most
ephemeral
resemblance
louis
was
intoxicated
with
love
la
valliere
with
happiness
with
ambition
and
the
painter
was
storing
up
recollections
for
his
old
age
two
hours
passed
away
in
this
manner
and
four
o
clock
having
struck
la
valliere
rose
and
made
a
sign
to
the
king
louis
also
rose
approached
the
picture
and
addressed
a
few
flattering
remarks
to
the
painter
also
praised
the
picture
which
as
he
pretended
was
already
beginning
to
assume
an
accurate
resemblance
la
valliere
in
her
turn
blushingly
thanked
the
painter
and
passed
into
the
next
room
where
the
king
followed
her
after
having
previously
summoned
will
you
not
come
he
said
to
la
valliere
oh
sire
pray
think
that
some
one
will
be
sure
to
come
to
my
room
and
will
not
find
me
well
what
will
become
of
me
in
that
case
you
are
very
apprehensive
but
at
all
events
suppose
madame
were
to
send
for
me
oh
replied
the
king
will
the
day
never
come
when
you
yourself
will
tell
me
to
brave
everything
so
that
i
may
not
have
to
leave
you
again
on
that
day
sire
i
shall
be
quite
out
of
my
mind
and
you
must
not
believe
la
valliere
sighed
but
without
the
courage
to
oppose
her
royal
lover
s
wish
she
repeated
then
since
you
desire
it
sire
and
with
these
words
she
ran
lightly
up
the
stairs
and
disappeared
from
her
lover
s
gaze
well
sire
inquired
when
she
had
left
well
yesterday
i
thought
myself
the
happiest
of
and
does
your
majesty
then
regard
yourself
said
the
comte
smiling
as
the
unhappiest
of
men
no
but
my
love
for
her
is
an
unquenchable
thirst
in
vain
do
i
drink
in
vain
do
i
swallow
the
drops
of
water
which
your
industry
procures
for
me
the
more
i
drink
the
more
unquenchable
it
sire
that
is
in
some
degree
your
own
fault
and
your
majesty
alone
has
made
the
position
such
as
it
you
are
in
that
case
therefore
the
means
to
be
happy
is
to
fancy
yourself
satisfied
and
to
wait
you
know
that
word
then
there
there
sire
do
not
despair
i
have
already
been
at
work
on
your
behalf
i
have
still
other
resources
in
the
king
shook
his
head
in
a
despairing
manner
what
sire
have
you
not
been
satisfied
hitherto
oh
yes
indeed
yes
my
dear
but
invent
for
heaven
s
sake
invent
some
further
project
sire
i
undertake
to
do
my
best
and
that
is
all
that
any
one
can
the
king
wished
to
see
the
portrait
again
as
he
was
unable
to
see
the
original
he
pointed
out
several
alterations
to
the
painter
and
left
the
room
and
then
dismissed
the
artist
the
easel
paints
and
painter
himself
had
scarcely
gone
when
malicorne
showed
his
head
in
the
doorway
he
was
received
by
with
open
arms
but
still
with
a
little
sadness
for
the
cloud
which
had
passed
across
the
royal
sun
veiled
in
its
turn
the
faithful
satellite
and
malicorne
at
a
glance
perceived
the
melancholy
that
brooded
on
s
face
oh
monsieur
le
comte
he
said
how
sad
you
seem
and
good
reason
too
my
dear
monsieur
malicorne
will
you
believe
that
the
king
is
still
dissatisfied
with
his
staircase
do
you
mean
oh
no
on
the
contrary
he
is
delighted
with
the
the
decorations
of
the
apartments
i
suppose
don
t
please
oh
he
has
not
even
thought
of
that
no
indeed
it
seems
that
what
has
dissatisfied
the
king
i
will
tell
you
monsieur
le
comte
he
is
dissatisfied
at
finding
himself
the
fourth
person
at
a
rendezvous
of
this
kind
how
is
it
possible
you
could
not
have
guessed
that
why
how
is
it
likely
i
could
have
done
so
dear
malicorne
when
i
followed
the
king
s
instructions
to
the
very
letter
did
his
majesty
really
insist
on
your
being
present
and
also
required
that
the
painter
whom
i
met
downstairs
just
now
should
be
here
too
he
insisted
upon
in
that
case
i
can
easily
understand
why
his
majesty
is
what
dissatisfied
that
i
have
so
punctually
and
so
literally
obeyed
his
orders
i
don
t
understand
malicorne
began
to
scratch
his
ear
as
he
asked
what
time
did
the
king
fix
for
the
rendezvous
in
your
apartments
two
o
and
you
were
waiting
for
the
king
ever
since
one
it
would
have
been
a
fine
thing
indeed
to
have
been
unpunctual
with
his
malicorne
notwithstanding
his
respect
for
could
not
help
smiling
and
the
painter
he
said
did
the
king
wish
him
to
be
here
at
two
o
clock
also
no
but
i
had
him
waiting
here
from
midday
far
better
you
know
for
a
painter
to
be
kept
waiting
a
couple
of
hours
than
the
king
a
single
malicorne
began
to
laugh
aloud
come
dear
monsieur
malicorne
said
laugh
less
at
me
and
speak
a
little
more
freely
i
well
then
monsieur
le
comte
if
you
wish
the
king
to
be
a
little
more
satisfied
the
next
time
he
comes
as
his
grandfather
used
to
say
of
course
i
wish
well
all
you
have
to
do
is
when
the
king
comes
to
be
obliged
to
go
away
on
a
most
pressing
matter
of
business
which
can
not
possibly
be
postponed
and
stay
away
for
twenty
what
leave

alone
for
twenty
minutes
cried
in
alarm
very
well
do
as
you
like
don
t
pay
any
attention
to
what
i
say
said
malicorne
moving
towards
the
door
nay
nay
dear
monsieur
malicorne
on
the
contrary

on
i
begin
to
understand
you
but
the
painter

painter

hour
half
an
hour

do
very
well

latest
news

most
respectful
servant
de
said
malicorne
bowing
profoundly
and
retiring
from
the
room
backwards
there
is
no
doubt
that
fellow
has
more
invention
than
i
have
said
as
if
compelled
by
his
conviction
to
admit

chapter
xxxvii
hampton
court
the
revelation
we
have
witnessed
that
montalais
made
to
la
valliere
in
a
preceding
chapter
very
naturally
makes
us
return
to
the
principal
hero
of
this
tale
a
poor
wandering
knight
roving
about
at
the
king
s
caprice
if
our
readers
will
be
good
enough
to
follow
us
we
will
in
his
company
cross
that
strait
more
stormy
than
the
euripus
which
separates
calais
from
dover
we
will
speed
across
that
green
and
fertile
country
with
its
numerous
little
streams
through
maidstone
and
many
other
villages
and
towns
each
prettier
than
the
other
and
finally
arrive
at
london
from
thence
like
bloodhounds
following
a
track
after
having
ascertained
that
raoul
had
made
his
first
stay
at
whitehall
his
second
at
james
s
and
having
learned
that
he
had
been
warmly
received
by
monk
and
introduced
to
the
best
society
of
charles
s
court
we
will
follow
him
to
one
of
charles
s
summer
residences
near
the
lively
little
village
of
kingston
at
hampton
court
situated
on
the
thames
the
river
is
not
at
that
spot
the
boastful
highway
which
bears
upon
its
broad
bosom
its
thousands
of
travelers
nor
are
its
waters
black
and
troubled
as
those
of
cocytus
as
it
boastfully
asserts
i
too
am
cousin
of
the
old
no
at
hampton
court
it
is
a
soft
and
murmuring
stream
with
banks
reflecting
in
its
broad
mirror
the
willows
and
beeches
which
ornament
its
sides
and
on
which
may
occasionally
be
seen
a
light
bark
indolently
reclining
among
the
tall
reeds
in
a
little
creek
formed
of
alders
and
the
surrounding
country
on
all
sides
smiled
in
happiness
and
wealth
the
brick
cottages
from
whose
chimneys
the
blue
smoke
was
slowly
ascending
in
wreaths
peeped
forth
from
the
belts
of
green
holly
which
environed
them
children
dressed
in
red
frocks
appeared
and
disappeared
amidst
the
high
grass
like
poppies
bowed
by
the
gentler
breath
of
the
passing
breeze
the
sheep
ruminating
with
eyes
lay
lazily
about
under
the
shadow
of
the
stunted
aspens
while
far
and
near
the
kingfishers
plumed
with
emerald
and
gold
skimmed
swiftly
along
the
surface
of
the
water
like
a
magic
ball
heedlessly
touching
as
he
passed
the
line
of
his
brother
angler
who
sat
watching
in
his
boat
the
fish
as
they
rose
to
the
surface
of
the
sparkling
stream
high
above
this
paradise
of
dark
shadows
and
soft
light
rose
the
palace
of
hampton
court
built
by
wolsey
a
residence
the
haughty
cardinal
had
been
obliged
timid
courtier
that
he
was
to
offer
to
his
master
henry
who
had
glowered
with
envy
and
cupidity
at
the
magnificent
new
home
hampton
court
with
its
brick
walls
its
large
windows
its
handsome
iron
gates
as
well
as
its
curious
bell
turrets
its
retired
covered
walks
and
interior
fountains
like
those
of
the
alhambra
was
a
perfect
bower
of
roses
jasmine
and
clematis
every
sense
sight
and
smell
particularly
was
gratified
and
the
formed
a
very
charming
framework
for
the
pictures
of
love
which
charles
ii
unrolled
among
the
voluptuous
paintings
of
titian
of
pordenone
and
of
van
dyck
the
same
charles
whose
father
s
portrait
the
martyr
king
was
hanging
in
his
gallery
and
who
could
show
upon
the
wainscots
of
the
various
apartments
the
holes
made
by
the
balls
of
the
puritanical
followers
of
cromwell
when
on
the
of
august
at
the
time
they
had
brought
charles
prisoner
to
hampton
court
there
it
was
that
the
king
intoxicated
with
pleasure
and
adventure
held
his
court
he
who
a
poet
in
feeling
thought
himself
justified
in
redeeming
by
a
whole
day
of
voluptuousness
every
minute
which
had
been
formerly
passed
in
anguish
and
misery
it
was
not
the
soft
green
sward
of
hampton
court
so
soft
that
it
almost
resembled
the
richest
velvet
in
the
thickness
of
its
texture
nor
was
it
the
beds
of
flowers
with
their
variegated
hues
which
encircled
the
foot
of
every
tree
with
many
feet
in
height
embracing
most
lovingly
their
trunks
nor
even
the
enormous
whose
branches
swept
the
earth
like
willows
offering
a
ready
concealment
for
love
or
reflection
beneath
the
shade
of
their
foliage
it
was
none
of
these
things
for
which
charles
ii
loved
his
palace
of
hampton
court
perhaps
it
might
have
been
that
beautiful
sheet
of
water
which
the
cool
breeze
rippled
like
the
wavy
undulations
of
cleopatra
s
hair
waters
bedecked
with
cresses
and
white
whose
chaste
bulbs
coyly
unfolding
themselves
beneath
the
sun
s
warm
rays
reveal
the
golden
gems
which
lie
concealed
within
their
milky
petals
murmuring
waters
on
the
bosom
of
which
black
swans
majestically
floated
and
the
graceful
with
their
tender
broods
covered
with
silken
down
darted
restlessly
in
every
direction
in
pursuit
of
the
insects
among
the
reeds
or
the
fogs
in
their
mossy
retreats
perhaps
it
might
have
been
the
enormous
hollies
with
their
dark
and
tender
green
foliage
or
the
bridges
uniting
the
banks
of
the
canals
in
their
embrace
or
the
fawns
browsing
in
the
endless
avenues
of
the
park
or
the
innumerable
birds
that
hopped
about
the
gardens
or
flew
from
branch
to
branch
amidst
the
emerald
foliage
it
might
well
have
been
any
of
these
charms
for
hampton
court
had
them
all
and
possessed
too
almost
forests
of
white
roses
which
climbed
and
trailed
along
the
lofty
trellises
showering
down
upon
the
ground
their
snowy
leaves
rich
with
soft
perfumery
but
no
what
charles
ii
most
loved
in
hampton
court
were
the
charming
figures
who
when
midday
was
past
flitted
to
and
fro
along
the
broad
terraces
of
the
gardens
like
louis
he
had
their
wealth
of
beauties
painted
for
his
gallery
by
one
of
the
great
artists
of
the
period
an
artist
who
well
knew
the
secret
of
transferring
to
canvas
the
rays
of
light
which
escaped
from
beaming
eyes
heavy
laden
with
love
and
love
s
delights
the
day
of
our
arrival
at
hampton
court
is
almost
as
clear
and
bright
as
a
summer
s
day
in
france
the
atmosphere
is
heavy
with
the
delicious
perfume
of
geraniums
seringas
and
heliotrope
scattered
in
profusion
around
it
is
past
midday
and
the
king
having
dined
after
his
return
from
hunting
paid
a
visit
to
lady
castlemaine
the
lady
who
was
reputed
at
the
time
to
hold
his
heart
in
bondage
and
this
proof
of
his
devotion
discharged
he
was
readily
permitted
to
pursue
his
infidelities
until
evening
arrived
love
and
amusement
ruled
the
entire
court
it
was
the
period
when
ladies
would
seriously
interrogate
their
ruder
companions
as
to
their
opinions
upon
a
foot
more
or
less
captivating
according
to
whether
it
wore
a
pink
or
lilac
silk
stocking
for
it
was
the
period
when
charles
ii
had
declared
that
there
was
no
hope
of
safety
for
a
woman
who
wore
green
silk
stockings
because
miss
lucy
stewart
wore
them
of
that
color
while
the
king
is
endeavoring
in
all
directions
to
inculcate
others
with
his
preferences
on
this
point
we
will
ourselves
bend
our
steps
towards
an
avenue
of
opposite
the
terrace
and
listen
to
the
conversation
of
a
young
girl
in
a
dress
who
is
walking
with
another
of
about
her
own
age
dressed
in
blue
they
crossed
a
beautiful
lawn
from
the
center
of
which
sprang
a
fountain
with
the
figure
of
a
siren
executed
in
bronze
and
strolled
on
talking
as
they
went
towards
the
terrace
along
which
looking
out
upon
the
park
and
interspersed
at
frequent
intervals
were
erected
diverse
in
form
and
ornament
these
were
nearly
all
occupied
the
two
young
women
passed
on
the
one
blushing
deeply
while
the
other
seemed
dreamily
silent
at
last
having
reached
the
end
of
the
terrace
which
looks
on
the
river
and
finding
there
a
cool
retreat
they
sat
down
close
to
each
other
where
are
we
going
said
the
younger
to
her
companion
my
dear
we
are
going
where
you
yourself
led
the
i
yes
you
to
the
extremity
of
the
palace
towards
that
seat
yonder
where
the
young
frenchman
is
seated
wasting
his
time
in
sighs
and
miss
mary
grafton
hurriedly
said
no
no
i
am
not
going
why
not
let
us
go
back
nay
on
the
contrary
let
us
go
on
and
have
an
what
about
about
how
it
happens
that
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
always
accompanies
you
in
all
your
walks
as
you
invariably
accompany
him
in
and
you
conclude
either
that
he
loves
me
or
that
i
love
him
why
not
he
is
a
most
agreeable
and
charming
no
one
hears
me
i
hope
said
lucy
stewart
as
she
turned
round
with
a
smile
which
indicated
moreover
that
her
uneasiness
on
the
subject
was
not
extreme
no
no
said
mary
the
king
is
engaged
in
his
with
the
duke
of
oh
of
the
duke
mary
it
seems
he
has
shown
you
great
attention
since
his
return
from
france
how
is
your
own
heart
in
that
direction
mary
grafton
shrugged
her
shoulders
with
seeming
indifference
well
well
i
will
ask
bragelonne
about
it
said
stewart
laughing
let
us
go
and
find
him
at
what
for
i
wish
to
speak
to
not
yet
one
word
before
you
do
come
come
you
who
know
so
many
of
the
king
s
secrets
tell
me
why
de
bragelonne
is
in
england
because
he
was
sent
as
an
envoy
from
one
sovereign
to
that
may
be
but
seriously
although
politics
do
not
much
concern
us
we
know
enough
to
be
satisfied
that
de
bragelonne
has
no
mission
of
serious
import
well
then
listen
said
stewart
with
assumed
gravity
for
your
sake
i
am
going
to
betray
a
state
secret
shall
i
tell
you
the
nature
of
the
letter
which
king
louis
xiv
gave
de
bragelonne
for
king
charles
i
will
these
are
the
very
words
my
brother
the
bearer
of
this
is
a
gentleman
attached
to
my
court
and
the
son
of
one
whom
you
regard
most
warmly
treat
him
kindly
i
beg
and
try
and
make
him
like
did
it
say
that
word
for
word
or
something
very
like
it
i
will
not
answer
for
the
form
but
the
substance
i
am
sure
well
and
what
conclusion
do
you
or
rather
what
conclusion
does
the
king
draw
from
that
that
the
king
of
france
has
his
own
reasons
for
removing
de
bragelonne
and
for
getting
him
married
anywhere
else
than
in
so
that
then
in
consequence
of
this
letter
king
charles
received
de
bragelonne
as
you
are
aware
in
the
most
distinguished
and
friendly
manner
the
handsomest
apartments
in
whitehall
were
allotted
to
him
and
as
you
are
the
most
valuable
and
precious
person
in
his
court
inasmuch
as
you
have
rejected
his
heart
nay
do
not
blush
he
wished
you
to
take
a
fancy
to
this
frenchman
and
he
was
desirous
to
confer
upon
him
so
costly
a
prize
and
this
is
the
reason
why
you
the
heiress
of
three
hundred
thousand
pounds
a
future
duchess
so
beautiful
so
good
have
been
thrown
in
bragelonne
s
way
in
all
the
promenades
and
parties
of
pleasure
to
which
he
was
invited
in
fact
it
was
a
plot
a
kind
of
mary
grafton
smiled
with
that
charming
expression
which
was
habitual
to
her
and
pressing
her
companion
s
arm
said
thank
the
king
yes
yes
but
the
duke
of
buckingham
is
jealous
so
take
hardly
had
she
pronounced
these
words
when
the
duke
appeared
from
one
of
the
pavilions
on
the
terrace
and
approaching
the
two
girls
with
a
smile
said
you
are
mistaken
miss
lucy
i
am
not
jealous
and
the
proof
miss
mary
is
yonder
in
the
person
of
de
bragelonne
himself
who
ought
to
be
the
cause
of
my
jealousy
but
who
is
dreaming
in
pensive
solitude
poor
fellow
allow
me
to
leave
you
for
a
few
minutes
while
i
avail
myself
of
those
few
minutes
to
converse
with
miss
lucy
stewart
to
whom
i
have
something
to
and
then
bowing
to
lucy
he
added
will
you
do
me
the
honor
to
accept
my
hand
in
order
that
i
may
lead
you
to
the
king
who
is
waiting
for
us
with
these
words
buckingham
still
smiling
took
miss
stewart
s
hand
and
led
her
away
when
by
herself
mary
grafton
her
head
gently
inclined
towards
her
shoulder
with
that
indolent
gracefulness
of
action
which
distinguishes
young
english
girls
remained
for
a
moment
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
raoul
but
as
if
uncertain
what
to
do
at
last
after
first
blushing
violently
and
then
turning
deadly
pale
thus
revealing
the
internal
combat
which
assailed
her
heart
she
seemed
to
make
up
her
mind
to
adopt
a
decided
course
and
with
a
tolerably
firm
step
advanced
towards
the
seat
on
which
raoul
was
reclining
buried
in
the
profoundest
meditation
as
we
have
already
said
the
sound
of
miss
mary
s
steps
though
they
could
hardly
be
heard
upon
the
green
sward
awakened
raoul
from
his
musing
attitude
he
turned
round
perceived
the
young
girl
and
walked
forward
to
meet
the
companion
whom
his
happy
destiny
had
thrown
in
his
way
i
have
been
sent
to
you
monsieur
said
mary
grafton
will
you
take
care
of
me
to
whom
is
my
gratitude
due
for
so
great
a
happiness
inquired
raoul
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
replied
mary
affecting
a
gayety
she
did
not
really
feel
to
the
duke
of
buckingham
do
you
say
he
who
so
passionately
seeks
your
charming
society
am
i
really
to
believe
you
are
serious
mademoiselle
the
fact
is
monsieur
you
perceive
that
everything
seems
to
conspire
to
make
us
pass
the
best
or
rather
the
longest
part
of
our
days
together
yesterday
it
was
the
king
who
desired
me
to
beg
you
to
seat
yourself
next
to
me
at
dinner
it
is
the
duke
of
buckingham
who
begs
me
to
come
and
place
myself
near
you
on
this
and
he
has
gone
away
in
order
to
leave
us
together
asked
raoul
with
some
embarrassment
look
yonder
at
the
turning
of
that
path
he
is
just
out
of
sight
with
miss
stewart
are
these
polite
attentions
usual
in
france
monsieur
le
vicomte
i
can
not
very
precisely
say
what
people
do
in
france
mademoiselle
for
i
can
hardly
be
called
a
frenchman
i
have
resided
in
many
countries
and
almost
always
as
a
soldier
and
then
i
have
spent
a
long
period
of
my
life
in
the
country
i
am
almost
a
you
do
not
like
your
residence
in
england
i
i
scarcely
know
said
raoul
inattentively
and
sighing
deeply
at
the
same
time
what
you
do
not
know
forgive
me
said
raoul
shaking
his
head
and
collecting
his
thoughts
i
did
not
hear
oh
said
the
young
girl
sighing
in
her
turn
how
wrong
the
duke
was
to
send
me
here
wrong
said
raoul
perhaps
so
for
i
am
but
a
rude
uncouth
companion
and
my
society
annoys
you
the
duke
did
indeed
very
wrong
to
send
it
is
precisely
replied
mary
grafton
in
a
clear
calm
voice
because
your
society
does
not
annoy
me
that
the
duke
was
wrong
to
send
me
to
it
was
now
raoul
s
turn
to
blush
but
he
resumed
how
happens
it
that
the
duke
of
buckingham
should
send
you
to
me
and
why
did
you
come
the
duke
loves
you
and
you
love
no
replied
mary
seriously
the
duke
does
not
love
me
because
he
is
in
love
with
the
duchesse
d
orleans
and
as
for
myself
i
have
no
affection
for
the
raoul
looked
at
the
young
lady
with
astonishment
are
you
a
friend
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
she
inquired
the
duke
has
honored
me
by
calling
me
so
ever
since
we
met
in
you
are
simple
acquaintances
then
no
for
the
duke
is
the
most
intimate
friend
of
one
whom
i
regard
as
a
the
duc
de
guiche
he
who
is
in
love
with
madame
la
duchesse
d
orleans
oh
what
is
that
you
are
saying
and
who
loves
him
in
return
continued
the
young
girl
quietly
raoul
bent
down
his
head
and
mary
grafton
sighing
deeply
continued
they
are
very
happy
but
leave
me
monsieur
de
bragelonne
for
the
duke
of
buckingham
has
given
you
a
very
troublesome
commission
in
offering
me
as
a
companion
for
your
promenade
your
heart
is
elsewhere
and
it
is
with
the
greatest
difficulty
you
can
be
charitable
enough
to
lend
me
your
attention
confess
truly
it
would
be
unfair
on
your
part
vicomte
not
to
admit
madame
i
do
confess
she
looked
at
him
steadily
he
was
so
noble
and
so
handsome
in
his
bearing
his
eyes
revealed
so
much
gentleness
candor
and
resolution
that
the
idea
could
not
possibly
enter
her
mind
that
he
was
either
rudely
discourteous
or
a
mere
simpleton
she
only
perceived
clearly
enough
that
he
loved
another
woman
and
not
herself
with
the
whole
strength
of
his
heart
ah
i
now
understand
you
she
said
you
have
left
your
heart
behind
you
in
raoul
bowed
the
duke
is
aware
of
your
affection
no
one
knows
it
replied
raoul
why
therefore
do
you
tell
me
nay
answer
i
can
not
it
is
for
me
then
to
anticipate
an
explanation
you
do
not
wish
to
tell
me
anything
because
you
are
now
convinced
that
i
do
not
love
the
duke
because
you
see
that
i
possibly
might
have
loved
you
because
you
are
a
gentleman
of
noble
and
delicate
sentiments
and
because
instead
of
accepting
even
were
it
for
the
mere
amusement
of
the
passing
hour
a
hand
which
is
almost
pressed
upon
you
and
because
instead
of
meeting
my
smiles
with
a
smiling
lip
you
who
are
young
have
preferred
to
tell
me
whom
men
have
called
beautiful
my
heart
is
over
the
sea
it
is
in
for
this
i
thank
you
monsieur
de
bragelonne
you
are
indeed
a
man
and
i
regard
you
all
the
more
for
it
as
a
friend
only
and
now
let
us
cease
speaking
of
myself
and
talk
of
your
own
affairs
forget
that
i
have
ever
spoken
to
you
of
myself
tell
me
why
you
are
sad
and
why
you
have
become
more
than
usually
so
during
these
past
four
days
raoul
was
deeply
and
sensibly
moved
by
these
sweet
and
melancholy
tones
and
as
he
could
not
at
the
moment
find
a
word
to
say
the
young
girl
again
came
to
his
assistance
pity
me
she
said
my
mother
was
born
in
france
and
i
can
truly
affirm
that
i
too
am
french
in
blood
as
well
as
in
feeling
but
the
leaden
atmosphere
and
characteristic
gloom
of
england
seem
to
weigh
upon
me
sometimes
my
dreams
are
and
full
of
wonderful
enjoyments
when
suddenly
a
mist
rises
and
overspreads
my
fancy
blotting
them
out
forever
such
indeed
is
the
case
at
the
present
moment
forgive
me
i
have
now
said
enough
on
that
subject
give
me
your
hand
and
relate
your
griefs
to
me
as
a
you
say
you
are
french
in
heart
and
soul
yes
not
only
i
repeat
it
that
my
mother
was
french
but
further
as
my
father
a
friend
of
king
charles
was
exiled
in
france
i
during
the
trial
of
that
prince
as
well
as
during
the
protector
s
life
was
brought
up
in
paris
at
the
restoration
of
king
charles
my
poor
father
returned
to
england
where
he
died
almost
immediately
afterwards
and
then
the
king
created
me
a
duchess
and
has
dowered
me
according
to
my
rank
have
you
any
relations
in
france
raoul
inquired
with
the
deepest
interest
i
have
a
sister
there
my
senior
by
seven
or
eight
years
who
was
married
in
france
and
was
early
left
a
widow
her
name
is
madame
de
belliere
do
you
know
her
she
added
observing
raoul
start
suddenly
i
have
heard
her
she
too
loves
with
her
whole
heart
and
her
last
letters
inform
me
she
is
happy
and
her
affection
is
i
conclude
returned
i
told
you
monsieur
de
bragelonne
that
although
i
possess
half
of
her
nature
i
do
not
share
her
happiness
but
let
us
now
speak
of
yourself
whom
do
you
love
in
france
a
young
girl
as
soft
and
pure
as
a
but
if
she
loves
you
why
are
you
sad
i
have
been
told
that
she
ceases
to
love
you
do
not
believe
it
i
trust
he
who
wrote
me
so
does
not
sign
his
an
anonymous
denunciation
some
treachery
be
assured
said
miss
grafton
stay
said
raoul
showing
the
young
girl
a
letter
which
he
had
read
over
a
thousand
times
she
took
it
from
his
hand
and
read
as
follows
vicomte
you
are
perfectly
right
to
amuse
yourself
yonder
with
the
lovely
faces
of
charles
s
court
for
at
louis
s
court
the
castle
in
which
your
affections
are
enshrined
is
being
besieged
stay
in
london
altogether
poor
vicomte
or
return
without
delay
to
there
is
no
signature
said
miss
mary
believe
it
not
very
good
but
here
is
a
second
letter
from
my
friend
de
guiche
which
says
i
am
lying
here
wounded
and
return
raoul
oh
return
what
do
you
intend
doing
inquired
the
young
girl
with
a
feeling
of
oppression
at
her
heart
my
intention
as
soon
as
i
received
this
letter
was
immediately
to
take
my
leave
of
the
when
did
you
receive
it
the
day
before
it
is
dated
a
singular
circumstance
do
you
not
think
for
the
court
is
now
at
paris
at
all
events
i
would
have
set
off
but
when
i
mentioned
my
intention
to
the
king
he
began
to
laugh
and
said
to
me
how
comes
it
monsieur
l
amassadeur
that
you
think
of
leaving
has
your
sovereign
recalled
you
i
colored
naturally
enough
for
i
was
confused
by
the
question
for
the
fact
is
the
king
himself
sent
me
here
and
i
have
received
no
order
to
mary
frowned
in
deep
thought
and
said
do
you
remain
then
i
must
do
you
ever
receive
any
letters
from
her
to
whom
you
are
so
devoted
never
do
you
say
does
she
not
love
you
then
at
least
she
has
not
written
to
me
since
my
departure
although
she
used
occasionally
to
write
to
me
before
i
trust
she
may
have
been
hush
the
duke
is
and
buckingham
at
that
moment
was
seen
at
the
end
of
the
walk
approaching
towards
them
alone
and
smiling
he
advanced
slowly
and
held
out
his
hands
to
them
both
have
you
arrived
at
an
understanding
he
said
about
what
about
whatever
might
render
you
happy
dear
mary
and
make
raoul
less
i
do
not
understand
you
my
lord
said
raoul
that
is
my
view
of
the
subject
miss
mary
do
you
wish
me
to
mention
it
before
de
bragelonne
he
added
with
a
smile
if
you
mean
replied
the
young
girl
haughtily
that
i
was
not
indisposed
to
love
de
bragelonne
that
is
useless
for
i
have
told
him
so
buckingham
reflected
for
a
moment
and
without
seeming
in
any
way
discountenanced
as
she
expected
he
said
my
reason
for
leaving
you
with
de
bragelonne
was
that
i
thoroughly
knew
your
refined
delicacy
of
feeling
no
less
than
the
perfect
loyalty
of
your
mind
and
heart
and
i
hoped
that
de
bragelonne
s
cure
might
be
effected
by
the
hands
of
a
physician
such
as
you
but
my
lord
before
you
spoke
of
de
bragelonne
s
heart
you
spoke
to
me
of
your
own
do
you
mean
to
effect
the
cure
of
two
hearts
at
the
same
time
perfectly
true
madame
but
you
will
do
me
the
justice
to
admit
that
i
have
long
discontinued
a
useless
pursuit
acknowledging
that
my
own
wound
is
my
lord
said
mary
collecting
herself
for
a
moment
before
she
spoke
m
de
bragelonne
is
happy
for
he
loves
and
is
beloved
he
has
no
need
of
such
a
physician
as
i
can
m
de
bragelonne
said
buckingham
is
on
the
very
eve
of
experiencing
a
serious
misfortune
and
he
has
greater
need
than
ever
of
sympathy
and
explain
yourself
my
lord
inquired
raoul
anxiously
no
gradually
i
will
explain
myself
but
if
you
desire
it
i
can
tell
miss
grafton
what
you
may
not
listen
to
my
lord
you
are
putting
me
to
the
torture
you
know
something
you
wish
to
conceal
from
me
i
know
that
miss
mary
grafton
is
the
most
charming
object
that
a
heart
ill
at
ease
could
possibly
meet
with
in
its
way
through
i
have
already
told
you
that
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
loves
elsewhere
said
the
young
girl
he
is
wrong
do
you
assume
to
know
my
lord
that
am
wrong
whom
is
it
that
he
loves
then
exclaimed
the
young
girl
he
loves
a
lady
who
is
unworthy
of
him
said
buckingham
with
that
calm
collected
manner
peculiar
to
englishmen
miss
grafton
uttered
a
cry
which
together
with
the
remark
that
buckingham
had
that
moment
made
spread
oover
de
bragelonne
s
features
a
deadly
paleness
arising
from
the
sudden
surprise
and
also
from
a
vague
fear
of
impending
misfortune
my
lord
he
exclaimed
you
have
just
pronounced
words
which
compel
me
without
a
moment
s
delay
to
seek
their
explanation
in
you
will
remain
here
said
buckingham
because
you
have
no
right
to
leave
and
no
one
has
the
right
to
quit
the
service
of
the
king
for
that
of
any
woman
even
were
she
as
worthy
of
being
loved
as
mary
grafton
you
will
tell
me
all
then
i
will
on
condition
that
you
will
i
will
remain
if
you
will
promise
to
speak
openly
and
without
thus
far
had
their
conversation
proceeded
and
buckingham
in
all
probability
was
on
the
point
of
revealing
not
indeed
all
that
had
taken
place
but
at
least
all
he
was
aware
of
when
one
of
the
king
s
attendants
appeared
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
and
advanced
towards
the
where
the
king
was
sitting
with
lucy
stewart
a
courier
followed
him
covered
with
dust
from
head
to
foot
and
who
seemed
as
if
he
had
but
a
few
moments
before
dismounted
from
his
horse
the
courier
from
france
madame
s
courier
exclaimed
raoul
recognizing
the
princess
s
livery
and
while
the
attendant
and
the
courier
advanced
towards
the
king
buckingham
and
miss
grafton
exchanged
a
look
full
of
intelligence
with
each
other
chapter
xxxviii
the
courier
from
madame
charles
ii
was
busily
engaged
in
proving
or
in
endeavoring
to
prove
to
miss
stewart
that
she
was
the
only
person
for
whom
he
cared
at
all
and
consequently
was
avowing
to
her
an
affection
similar
to
that
which
his
ancestor
henry
iv
had
entertained
for
gabrielle
unfortunately
for
charles
he
had
hit
upon
an
unlucky
day
the
very
day
miss
stewart
had
taken
it
into
her
head
to
make
him
jealous
and
therefore
instead
of
being
touched
by
his
offer
as
the
king
had
hoped
she
laughed
heartily
oh
sire
sire
she
cried
laughing
all
the
while
if
i
were
to
be
unfortunate
enough
to
ask
you
for
a
proof
of
the
affection
you
possess
how
easy
it
would
be
to
see
that
you
are
telling
a
nay
listen
to
me
said
charles
you
know
my
cartoons
by
raphael
you
know
whether
i
care
for
them
or
not
the
whole
world
envies
me
their
possession
as
you
well
know
also
my
father
commissioned
van
dyck
to
purchase
them
would
you
like
me
to
send
them
to
your
house
this
very
day
oh
no
replied
the
young
girl
pray
keep
them
yourself
sire
my
house
is
far
too
small
to
accommodate
such
in
that
case
you
shall
have
hampton
court
to
put
the
cartoons
be
less
generous
sire
and
learn
to
love
a
little
while
longer
that
is
all
i
have
to
ask
i
shall
never
cease
to
love
you
is
not
that
enough
you
are
smiling
do
you
wish
me
to
weep
no
but
i
should
like
to
see
you
a
little
more
thank
heaven
i
have
been
so
long
enough
fourteen
years
of
exile
poverty
and
misery
i
think
i
may
well
regard
it
as
a
debt
discharged
besides
melancholy
makes
people
look
so
far
from
that
for
look
at
the
young
what
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
are
you
smitten
too
by
heaven
they
will
all
grow
mad
over
him
one
after
the
other
but
he
on
the
contrary
has
a
reason
for
being
why
so
oh
indeed
you
wish
me
to
betray
state
secrets
do
you
if
i
wish
it
you
must
do
so
for
you
told
me
you
were
quite
ready
to
do
everything
i
well
then
he
is
bored
in
his
own
country
does
that
satisfy
you
bored
yes
a
proof
that
he
is
a
simpleton
i
allow
him
to
fall
in
love
with
miss
mary
grafton
and
he
feels
bored
can
you
believe
it
very
good
it
seems
then
that
if
you
were
to
find
miss
lucy
stewart
indifferent
to
you
you
would
console
yourself
by
falling
in
love
with
miss
mary
i
don
t
say
that
in
the
first
place
you
know
that
mary
grafton
does
not
care
for
me
besides
a
man
can
only
console
himself
for
a
lost
affection
by
the
discovery
of
a
new
one
again
however
i
repeat
the
question
is
not
of
myself
but
of
that
young
man
one
might
almost
be
tempted
to
call
the
girl
he
has
left
behind
him
a
helen
a
helen
before
the
little
ceremony
she
went
through
with
paris
of
he
has
left
some
one
then
that
is
to
say
some
one
has
left
poor
fellow
so
much
the
worse
why
do
you
mean
by
so
much
the
worse
why
not
why
did
he
leave
do
you
think
it
was
of
his
own
wish
or
will
that
he
left
was
he
obliged
to
leave
then
he
left
paris
under
orders
my
dear
stewart
and
prepare
to
be
surprised
by
express
orders
of
the
ah
i
begin
to
see
at
least
say
nothing
at
all
about
you
know
very
well
that
i
am
just
as
discreet
as
anybody
else
and
so
the
king
sent
him
away
and
during
his
absence
he
takes
his
sweetheart
from
him
yes
and
will
you
believe
it
the
silly
fellow
instead
of
thanking
the
king
is
making
himself
what
thank
the
king
for
depriving
him
of
the
woman
he
loves
really
sire
yours
is
a
most
ungallant
but
pray
understand
me
if
she
whom
the
king
had
run
off
with
was
either
a
miss
grafton
or
a
miss
stewart
i
should
not
be
of
his
opinion
nay
i
should
even
think
him
not
half
wretched
enough
but
she
is
a
little
thin
lame
thing
deuce
take
such
fidelity
as
that
surely
one
can
hardly
understand
how
a
man
can
refuse
a
girl
who
is
rich
for
one
who
is
poverty
itself
a
girl
who
loves
him
for
one
who
deceives
and
betrays
do
you
think
that
mary
seriously
wishes
to
please
the
vicomte
sire
i
do
very
good
the
vicomte
will
settle
down
in
england
for
mary
has
a
clear
head
and
when
she
fixes
her
mind
upon
anything
she
does
so
take
care
my
dear
miss
stewart
if
the
vicomte
has
any
idea
of
adopting
our
country
he
has
not
long
to
do
so
for
it
was
only
the
day
before
yesterday
that
he
again
asked
me
for
permission
to
which
you
refused
him
i
suppose
i
should
think
so
indeed
my
royal
brother
is
far
too
anxious
for
his
absence
and
for
myself
my
is
enlisted
on
his
side
for
i
will
never
have
it
said
that
i
had
held
out
as
a
bait
to
this
young
man
the
noblest
and
gentlest
creature
in
england
you
are
very
gallant
sire
said
miss
stewart
with
a
pretty
pout
i
do
not
allude
to
miss
stewart
for
she
is
worthy
of
a
king
s
devotion
and
since
she
has
captivated
me
i
trust
that
no
one
else
will
be
caught
by
her
i
say
therefore
finally
that
the
attention
i
have
shown
this
young
man
will
not
have
been
thrown
away
he
will
stay
with
us
here
he
will
marry
here
or
i
am
very
much
and
i
hope
that
when
he
is
once
married
and
settled
instead
of
being
angry
with
your
majesty
he
will
be
grateful
to
you
for
every
one
tries
his
utmost
to
please
him
even
the
duke
of
buckingham
whose
brilliancy
which
is
incredible
seems
to
pale
before
that
of
this
young
including
miss
stewart
even
who
calls
him
the
most
finished
gentleman
she
ever
stay
sire
you
have
spoken
quite
enough
and
quite
highly
enough
of
miss
grafton
to
overlook
what
i
may
have
said
about
de
bragelonne
but
by
the
by
sire
your
kindness
for
some
time
past
astonishes
me
you
think
of
those
who
are
absent
you
forgive
those
who
have
done
you
a
wrong
in
fact
you
are
as
nearly
as
possible
perfect
how
does
it
happen
it
is
because
you
allow
yourself
to
be
loved
he
said
beginning
to
laugh
oh
there
must
be
some
other
well
i
am
doing
all
i
can
to
oblige
my
brother
louis
nay
i
must
have
another
well
then
the
true
motive
is
that
buckingham
strongly
recommended
the
young
man
to
me
saying
sire
i
begin
by
yielding
up
all
claim
to
miss
grafton
i
pray
you
follow
my
the
duke
is
indeed
a
true
oh
of
course
of
course
it
is
buckingham
s
turn
now
i
suppose
to
turn
your
head
you
seem
determined
to
cross
me
in
everything
at
this
moment
some
one
rapped
at
the
door
who
is
it
who
presumes
to
interrupt
us
exclaimed
charles
impatiently
really
sire
you
are
extremely
vain
with
your
who
is
it
who
presumes
and
in
order
to
punish
you
for
it
she
went
to
the
door
and
opened
it
it
is
a
courier
from
france
said
miss
stewart
a
courier
from
france
exclaimed
charles
from
my
sister
perhaps
yes
sire
said
the
usher
a
special
let
him
come
in
at
once
said
charles
you
have
a
letter
for
me
said
the
king
to
the
courier
as
he
entered
from
the
duchess
of
orleans
yes
sire
replied
the
courier
and
so
urgent
in
its
nature
that
i
have
only
been
hours
in
bringing
it
to
your
majesty
and
yet
i
lost
of
an
hour
at
your
zeal
shall
not
be
forgotten
said
the
king
as
he
opened
the
letter
when
he
had
read
it
he
burst
out
laughing
and
exclaimed
upon
my
word
i
am
at
a
loss
to
understand
anything
about
he
then
read
the
letter
a
second
time
miss
stewart
assuming
a
manner
marked
by
the
greatest
reserve
and
doing
her
utmost
to
restrain
her
ardent
curiosity
francis
said
the
king
to
his
valet
see
that
this
excellent
fellow
is
well
taken
care
of
and
sleeps
soundly
and
that
on
waking
he
finds
a
purse
of
fifty
sovereigns
by
his
sire
said
the
courier
amazed
begone
begone
my
sister
was
perfectly
right
in
desiring
you
to
use
the
utmost
diligence
the
affair
was
most
and
he
again
began
to
laugh
louder
than
ever
the
courier
the
valet
and
miss
stewart
hardly
knew
what
sort
of
countenance
to
assume
ah
said
the
king
throwing
himself
back
in
his
armchair
when
i
think
that
you
have
knocked
up
how
many
horses
two
two
horses
to
bring
this
intelligence
to
me
that
will
do
you
can
leave
us
the
courier
retired
with
the
valet
charles
went
to
the
window
which
he
opened
and
leaning
forward
called
out
duke
buckingham
come
here
there
s
a
good
the
duke
hurried
to
him
in
obedience
to
the
summons
but
when
he
reached
the
door
and
perceived
miss
stewart
he
hesitated
to
enter
come
in
and
shut
the
door
said
the
king
the
duke
obeyed
and
perceiving
in
what
an
excellent
humor
the
king
was
he
advanced
smiling
towards
him
well
my
dear
duke
how
do
you
get
on
with
your
frenchman
sire
i
am
in
the
most
perfect
state
of
utter
despair
about
why
so
because
charming
miss
grafton
is
willing
to
marry
him
but
he
is
why
he
is
a
perfect
boeotian
cried
miss
stewart
let
him
say
either
yes
or
no
and
let
the
affair
but
said
buckingham
seriously
you
know
or
you
ought
to
know
madame
that
de
bragelonne
is
in
love
in
another
in
that
case
said
the
king
coming
to
miss
stewart
s
help
nothing
is
easier
let
him
say
no
very
true
and
i
have
proved
to
him
he
was
wrong
not
to
say
you
told
him
candidly
i
suppose
that
la
valliere
was
deceiving
him
yes
without
the
slightest
reserve
and
as
soon
as
i
had
done
so
he
gave
a
start
as
if
he
were
going
to
clear
the
channel
at
a
at
all
events
said
miss
stewart
he
has
done
something
and
a
very
good
thing
too
upon
my
but
said
buckingham
i
stopped
him
i
have
left
him
and
miss
mary
in
conversation
together
and
i
sincerely
trust
that
now
he
will
not
leave
as
he
seemed
to
have
an
idea
of
an
idea
of
leaving
england
cried
the
king
i
at
one
moment
hardly
thought
that
any
human
power
could
have
prevented
him
but
miss
mary
s
eyes
are
now
bent
fully
on
him
and
he
will
well
that
is
the
very
thing
which
deceives
you
buckingham
said
the
king
with
a
peal
of
laughter
the
poor
fellow
is
predestined
to
what
if
it
were
to
be
simply
deceived
that
is
nothing
but
to
look
at
him
it
is
a
great
at
a
distance
and
with
miss
grafton
s
aid
the
blow
will
be
warded
far
from
it
far
from
it
neither
distance
nor
miss
grafton
s
help
will
be
of
the
slightest
avail
bragelonne
will
set
off
for
paris
within
an
hour
s
buckingham
started
and
miss
stewart
opened
her
eyes
very
wide
in
astonishment
but
sire
said
the
duke
your
majesty
knows
that
it
is
that
is
to
say
my
dear
buckingham
that
it
is
impossible
until
it
do
not
forget
sire
that
the
young
man
is
a
perfect
lion
and
that
his
wrath
is
i
don
t
deny
it
my
dear
and
that
if
he
sees
that
his
misfortune
is
certain
so
much
the
worse
for
the
author
of
i
don
t
deny
it
but
what
the
deuce
am
i
to
do
were
it
the
king
himself
cried
buckingham
i
would
not
answer
for
oh
the
king
has
his
musketeers
to
take
care
of
him
said
charles
quietly
i
know
that
perfectly
well
for
i
was
kept
dancing
attendance
in
his
at
blois
he
has
d
artagnan
and
what
better
guardian
could
the
king
have
than
d
artagnan
i
should
make
myself
perfectly
easy
with
twenty
storms
of
passion
such
as
bragelonne
might
display
if
i
had
four
guardians
like
d
but
i
entreat
your
majesty
who
is
so
good
and
kind
to
reflect
a
stay
said
charles
presenting
the
letter
to
the
duke
read
and
answer
yourself
what
you
would
do
in
my
buckingham
slowly
took
hold
of
madame
s
letter
and
trembling
with
emotion
read
the
following
words
for
your
own
sake
for
mine
for
the
honor
and
safety
of
every
one
send
de
bragelonne
back
to
france
immediately
your
devoted
sister
well
villiers
what
do
you
say
really
sire
i
have
nothing
to
say
replied
the
duke
stupefied
nay
would
you
of
all
persons
said
the
king
artfully
advise
me
not
to
listen
to
my
sister
when
she
writes
so
urgently
oh
no
no
sire
and
yet
you
have
not
read
the
postscript
villiers
it
is
under
the
fold
of
the
letter
and
escaped
me
at
first
read
and
as
the
duke
turned
down
a
fold
of
the
letter
he
read
a
thousand
kind
remembrances
to
those
who
love
the
duke
s
head
sank
gradually
on
his
breast
the
paper
trembled
in
his
fingers
as
if
it
had
been
changed
to
lead
the
king
paused
for
a
moment
and
seeing
that
buckingham
did
not
speak
he
must
follow
his
destiny
as
we
ours
continued
the
king
every
man
has
his
own
share
of
grief
in
this
world
i
have
had
my
own
i
have
had
that
of
others
who
belong
to
me
and
have
thus
had
a
double
weight
of
woe
to
endure
but
the
deuce
take
all
my
cares
now
go
and
bring
our
friend
here
the
duke
opened
the
trellised
door
of
the
and
pointing
at
raoul
and
mary
who
were
walking
together
side
by
side
said
what
a
cruel
blow
sire
for
poor
miss
grafton
nonsense
call
him
said
charles
knitting
his
black
brows
together
every
one
seems
to
be
sentimental
here
there
look
at
miss
stewart
who
is
wiping
her
eyes
now
deuce
take
the
french
fellow
the
duke
called
to
raoul
and
taking
miss
grafton
by
the
hand
he
led
her
towards
the
king
monsieur
de
bragelonne
said
charles
did
you
not
ask
me
the
day
before
yesterday
for
permission
to
return
to
paris
yes
sire
replied
raoul
greatly
puzzled
by
this
address
and
i
refused
you
i
think
yes
for
which
you
were
angry
with
me
no
sire
your
majesty
had
no
doubt
excellent
reasons
for
withholding
it
for
you
are
so
wise
and
so
good
that
everything
you
do
is
well
i
alleged
i
believe
as
a
reason
that
the
king
of
france
had
not
recalled
you
yes
sire
that
was
the
reason
you
well
de
bragelonne
i
have
reflected
over
the
matter
since
if
the
king
did
not
in
fact
fix
your
return
he
begged
me
to
render
your
sojourn
in
england
as
agreeable
as
possible
since
however
you
ask
my
permission
to
return
it
is
because
your
longer
residence
in
england
is
no
longer
agreeable
to
i
do
not
say
that
no
but
your
request
at
least
said
the
king
signified
that
another
place
of
residence
would
be
more
agreeable
to
you
than
at
this
moment
raoul
turned
towards
the
door
against
which
miss
grafton
was
leaning
pale
and
her
other
hand
was
passed
through
the
duke
s
arm
you
do
not
reply
pursued
charles
the
proverb
is
plain
enough
that
silence
gives
very
good
monsieur
de
bragelonne
i
am
now
in
a
position
to
satisfy
you
whenever
you
please
therefore
you
can
leave
for
paris
for
which
you
have
my
sire
exclaimed
raoul
while
mary
stifled
an
exclamation
of
grief
which
rose
to
her
lips
unconsciously
pressing
buckingham
s
arm
you
can
be
at
dover
this
evening
continued
the
king
the
tide
serves
at
two
o
clock
in
the
raoul
astounded
stammered
out
a
few
broken
sentences
which
equally
answered
the
purpose
both
of
thanks
and
of
excuse
i
therefore
bid
you
adieu
monsieur
de
bragelonne
and
wish
you
every
sort
of
prosperity
said
the
king
rising
you
will
confer
a
pleasure
on
me
by
keeping
this
diamond
in
remembrance
of
me
i
had
intended
it
as
a
marriage
miss
grafton
felt
her
limbs
almost
giving
way
and
as
raoul
received
the
ring
from
the
king
s
hand
he
too
felt
his
strength
and
courage
failing
him
he
addressed
a
few
respectful
words
to
the
king
a
passing
compliment
to
miss
stewart
and
looked
for
buckingham
to
bid
him
adieu
the
king
profited
by
this
moment
to
disappear
raoul
found
the
duke
engaged
in
endeavoring
to
encourage
miss
grafton
tell
him
to
remain
i
implore
you
said
buckingham
to
mary
no
i
will
tell
him
to
go
replied
miss
grafton
with
returning
animation
i
am
not
one
of
those
women
who
have
more
pride
than
heart
if
she
whom
he
loves
is
in
france
let
him
return
thither
and
bless
me
for
having
advised
him
to
go
and
seek
his
happiness
there
if
on
the
contrary
she
shall
have
ceased
to
love
him
let
him
come
back
here
again
i
shall
still
love
him
and
his
unhappiness
will
not
have
lessened
him
in
my
regard
in
the
arms
of
my
house
you
will
find
that
which
heaven
has
engraven
on
my
heart
parum
egenti
to
the
rich
is
accorded
little
to
the
poor
i
do
not
believe
bragelonne
that
you
will
find
yonder
the
equivalent
of
what
you
leave
behind
you
i
think
or
at
least
hope
said
raoul
with
a
gloomy
air
that
she
whom
i
love
is
worthy
of
my
affection
but
if
it
be
true
she
is
unworthy
of
me
as
you
have
endeavored
to
make
me
believe
i
will
tear
her
image
from
my
heart
duke
even
if
my
heart
breaks
in
the
mary
grafton
gazed
upon
him
with
an
expression
of
the
most
indefinable
pity
and
raoul
returned
her
look
with
a
sweet
sorrowful
smile
saying
mademoiselle
the
diamond
which
the
king
has
given
me
was
destined
for
you
give
me
leave
to
offer
it
for
your
acceptance
if
i
marry
in
france
you
will
send
it
me
back
if
i
do
not
marry
keep
and
he
bowed
and
left
her
what
does
he
mean
thought
buckingham
while
raoul
pressed
mary
s
icy
hand
with
marks
of
the
most
reverential
respect
mary
understood
the
look
that
buckingham
fixed
upon
her
if
it
were
a
i
would
not
accept
it
she
said
and
yet
you
were
willing
to
ask
him
to
return
to
oh
duke
cried
the
young
girl
in
accents
a
woman
such
as
i
am
is
never
accepted
as
a
consolation
by
a
man
like
you
do
not
think
he
will
return
then
never
said
miss
grafton
in
a
choking
voice
and
i
grieve
to
tell
you
mary
that
he
will
find
yonder
his
happiness
destroyed
his
mistress
lost
to
him
his
honor
even
has
not
escaped
what
will
be
left
him
then
mary
equal
to
your
affection
answer
mary
you
who
know
yourself
so
miss
grafton
placed
her
white
hand
on
buckingham
s
arm
and
while
raoul
was
hurrying
away
with
headlong
speed
she
repeated
in
dying
accents
the
line
from
romeo
and
juliet
must
be
gone
and
live
or
stay
and
as
she
finished
the
last
word
raoul
disappeared
miss
grafton
returned
to
her
own
apartments
paler
than
death
buckingham
availed
himself
of
the
arrival
of
the
courier
who
had
brought
the
letter
to
the
king
to
write
to
madame
and
to
the
comte
de
guiche
the
king
had
not
been
mistaken
for
at
two
in
the
morning
the
tide
was
at
full
flood
and
raoul
had
embarked
for
france
chapter
xxxix
follows
malicorne
s
advice
the
king
most
assiduously
followed
the
progress
which
was
made
in
la
valliere
s
portrait
and
did
so
with
a
care
and
attention
arising
as
much
from
a
desire
that
it
should
resemble
her
as
from
the
wish
that
the
painter
should
prolong
the
period
of
its
completion
as
much
as
possible
it
was
amusing
to
observe
him
follow
the
artist
s
brush
awaiting
the
completion
of
a
particular
plan
or
the
result
of
a
combination
of
colors
and
suggesting
various
modifications
to
the
painter
which
the
latter
consented
to
adopt
with
the
most
respectful
docility
and
again
when
the
artist
following
malicorne
s
advice
was
a
little
late
in
arriving
and
when
had
been
obliged
to
be
absent
for
some
time
it
was
interesting
to
observe
though
no
one
witnessed
them
those
moments
of
silence
full
of
deep
expression
which
united
in
one
sigh
two
souls
most
disposed
to
understand
each
other
and
who
by
no
means
objected
to
the
quiet
meditation
they
enjoyed
together
the
minutes
flew
rapidly
by
as
if
on
wings
and
as
the
king
drew
closer
to
louise
and
bent
his
burning
gaze
upon
her
a
noise
was
suddenly
heard
in
the
it
was
the
artist
who
had
just
arrived
too
had
returned
full
of
apologies
and
the
king
began
to
talk
and
la
valliere
to
answer
him
very
hurriedly
their
eyes
revealing
to
that
they
had
enjoyed
a
century
of
happiness
during
his
absence
in
a
word
malicorne
philosopher
that
he
was
though
he
knew
it
not
had
learned
how
to
inspire
the
king
with
an
appetite
in
the
midst
of
plenty
and
with
desire
in
the
assurance
of
possession
la
valliere
s
fears
of
interruption
had
never
been
realized
and
no
one
imagined
she
was
absent
from
her
apartment
two
or
three
hours
every
day
she
pretended
that
her
health
was
very
uncertain
those
who
went
to
her
room
always
knocked
before
entering
and
malicorne
the
man
of
so
many
ingenious
inventions
had
constructed
an
acoustic
piece
of
mechanism
by
means
of
which
la
valliere
when
in
s
apartment
was
always
forewarned
of
any
visits
which
were
paid
to
the
room
she
usually
inhabited
in
this
manner
therefore
without
leaving
her
room
and
having
no
she
was
able
to
return
to
her
apartment
thus
removing
by
her
appearance
a
little
tardy
perhaps
the
suspicions
of
the
most
determined
skeptics
malicorne
having
asked
the
next
morning
what
news
he
had
to
report
the
latter
was
obliged
to
confess
that
the
quarter
of
an
hour
s
liberty
had
made
the
king
in
most
excellent
humor
we
must
double
the
dose
replied
malicorne
but
by
insensible
degrees
wait
until
they
seem
to
wish
they
were
so
desirous
for
it
however
that
on
the
evening
of
the
fourth
day
at
the
moment
when
the
painter
was
packing
up
his
implements
during
s
continued
absence
on
his
return
noticed
upon
la
valliere
s
face
a
shade
of
disappointment
and
vexation
which
she
could
not
conceal
the
king
was
less
reserved
and
exhibited
his
annoyance
by
a
very
significant
shrug
of
the
shoulders
at
which
la
valliere
could
not
help
blushing
very
good
thought
to
himself
m
malicorne
will
be
delighted
this
evening
as
he
in
fact
was
when
it
was
reported
to
him
it
is
very
evident
he
remarked
to
the
comte
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
hoped
that
you
would
be
at
least
ten
minutes
and
the
king
that
i
should
be
half
an
hour
later
dear
monsieur
you
would
show
but
very
indifferent
devotion
to
the
king
replied
the
latter
if
you
were
to
refuse
his
majesty
that
s
but
the
painter
objected
will
take
care
of
him
said
malicorne
only
i
must
study
faces
and
circumstances
a
little
better
before
i
act
those
are
my
magical
inventions
and
contrivances
and
while
sorcerers
are
enabled
by
means
of
their
astrolabe
to
take
the
altitude
of
the
sun
moon
and
stars
i
am
satisfied
merely
by
looking
into
people
s
faces
in
order
to
see
if
their
eyes
are
encircled
with
dark
lines
and
if
the
mouth
describes
a
convex
or
concave
and
the
cunning
malicorne
had
every
opportunity
of
watching
narrowly
and
closely
for
the
very
same
evening
the
king
accompanied
the
queen
to
madame
s
apartments
and
made
himself
so
remarked
by
his
serious
face
and
his
deep
sigh
and
looked
at
la
valliere
with
such
a
languishing
expression
that
malicorne
said
to
montalais
during
the
evening
and
he
went
off
to
the
painter
s
house
in
the
street
of
the
jardins
to
request
him
to
postpone
the
next
sitting
for
a
couple
of
days
was
not
within
when
la
valliere
who
was
now
quite
familiar
with
the
lower
story
lifted
up
the
and
descended
the
king
as
usual
was
waiting
for
her
on
the
staircase
and
held
a
bouquet
in
his
hand
as
soon
as
he
saw
her
he
clasped
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
la
valliere
much
moved
at
the
action
looked
around
the
room
but
as
she
saw
the
king
was
alone
she
did
not
complain
of
it
they
sat
down
the
king
reclining
near
the
cushions
on
which
louise
was
seated
with
his
head
supported
by
her
knees
placed
there
as
in
an
asylum
whence
no
one
could
banish
him
he
gazed
ardently
upon
her
and
as
if
the
moment
had
arrived
when
nothing
could
interpose
between
their
two
hearts
she
too
gazed
with
similar
passion
upon
him
and
from
her
eyes
so
softly
pure
emanated
a
flame
whose
rays
first
kindled
and
then
inflamed
the
heart
of
the
king
who
trembling
with
happiness
as
louise
s
hand
rested
on
his
head
grew
giddy
from
excess
of
joy
and
momentarily
awaited
either
the
painter
s
or
s
return
to
break
the
sweet
illusion
but
the
door
remained
closed
and
neither
nor
the
painter
appeared
nor
did
the
hangings
even
move
a
deep
mysterious
silence
reigned
in
the
room
a
silence
which
seemed
to
influence
even
the
in
their
gilded
prisons
the
king
completely
overcome
turned
round
his
head
and
buried
his
burning
lips
in
la
valliere
s
hands
who
herself
faint
with
excess
of
emotion
pressed
her
trembling
hands
against
her
lover
s
lips
louis
threw
himself
upon
his
knees
and
as
la
valliere
did
not
move
her
head
the
king
s
forehead
being
within
reach
of
her
lips
she
furtively
passed
her
lips
across
the
perfumed
locks
which
caressed
her
cheeks
the
king
seized
her
in
his
arms
and
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
they
exchanged
their
first
kiss
that
burning
kiss
which
changes
love
into
delirium
suddenly
a
noise
upon
the
upper
floor
was
heard
which
had
in
fact
continued
though
it
had
remained
unnoticed
for
some
time
it
had
at
last
aroused
la
valliere
s
attention
though
but
slowly
so
as
the
noise
however
continued
as
it
forced
itself
upon
the
attention
and
recalled
the
poor
girl
from
her
dreams
of
happiness
to
the
sad
realities
of
life
she
rose
in
a
state
of
utter
bewilderment
though
beautiful
in
her
disorder
saying
some
one
is
waiting
for
me
above
louis
louis
do
you
not
hear
well
and
am
i
not
waiting
for
you
also
said
the
king
with
infinite
tenderness
of
tone
let
others
henceforth
wait
for
but
she
gently
shook
her
head
as
she
replied
happiness
hidden
power
concealed
my
pride
should
be
as
silent
as
my
the
noise
was
again
resumed
i
hear
montalais
s
voice
she
said
and
she
hurried
up
the
staircase
the
king
followed
her
unable
to
let
her
leave
his
sight
and
covering
her
hand
with
his
kisses
yes
yes
repeated
la
valliere
who
had
passed
through
the
opening
yes
it
is
montalais
who
is
calling
me
something
important
must
have
go
then
dearest
love
said
the
king
but
return
no
no
not
sire
adieu
adieu
she
said
as
she
stooped
down
once
more
to
embrace
her
lover
and
escaped
montalais
was
in
fact
waiting
for
her
very
pale
and
agitated
quick
quick
is
coming
she
said
who
who
is
coming
raoul
murmured
montalais
it
is
i
i
said
a
joyous
voice
upon
the
last
steps
of
the
grand
staircase
la
valliere
uttered
a
terrible
shriek
and
threw
herself
back
i
am
here
dear
louise
said
raoul
running
towards
her
i
knew
but
too
well
that
you
had
not
ceased
to
love
la
valliere
with
a
gesture
partly
of
extreme
terror
and
partly
as
if
invoking
a
blessing
attempted
to
speak
but
could
not
articulate
one
word
no
no
she
said
as
she
fell
into
montalais
s
arms
murmuring
do
not
touch
me
do
not
come
near
montalais
made
a
sign
to
raoul
who
stood
almost
petrified
at
the
door
and
did
not
even
attempt
to
advance
another
step
into
the
room
then
looking
towards
the
side
of
the
room
where
the
screen
was
she
exclaimed
imprudent
girl
she
has
not
even
closed
the
and
she
advanced
towards
the
corner
of
the
room
to
close
the
screen
and
also
behind
the
screen
the
but
suddenly
the
king
who
had
heard
louise
s
exclamation
darted
through
the
opening
and
hurried
forward
to
her
assistance
he
threw
himself
on
his
knees
before
her
as
he
overwhelmed
montalais
with
questions
who
hardly
knew
where
she
was
at
the
moment
however
when
the
king
threw
himself
on
his
knees
a
cry
of
utter
despair
rang
through
the
corridor
accompanied
by
the
sound
of
retreating
footsteps
the
king
wished
to
see
who
had
uttered
the
cry
and
whose
were
the
footsteps
he
had
heard
and
it
was
in
vain
that
montalais
sought
to
retain
him
for
louis
quitting
his
hold
of
la
valliere
hurried
towards
the
door
too
late
however
for
raoul
was
already
at
a
distance
and
the
king
only
beheld
a
shadow
that
quickly
vanished
in
the
silent
corridor
chapter
xl
two
old
friends
whilst
every
one
at
court
was
busily
engaged
with
his
own
affairs
a
man
mysteriously
took
up
his
post
behind
the
place
de
greve
in
the
house
which
we
once
saw
besieged
by
d
artagnan
on
the
occasion
of
the
the
principal
entrance
of
the
house
was
in
the
place
baudoyer
it
was
tolerably
large
surrounded
by
gardens
inclosed
in
the
rue
by
the
shops
of
toolmakers
which
protected
it
from
prying
looks
and
was
walled
in
by
a
triple
rampart
of
stone
noise
and
verdure
like
an
embalmed
mummy
in
its
triple
coffin
the
man
we
have
just
alluded
to
walked
along
with
a
firm
step
although
he
was
no
longer
in
his
early
prime
his
dark
cloak
and
long
sword
plainly
revealed
one
who
seemed
in
search
of
adventures
and
judging
from
his
curling
mustache
his
fine
smooth
skin
which
could
be
seen
beneath
his
it
would
not
have
been
difficult
to
pronounce
that
gallantry
had
not
a
little
share
in
his
adventures
in
fact
hardly
had
the
cavalier
entered
the
house
when
the
clock
struck
eight
and
ten
minutes
afterwards
a
lady
followed
by
a
servant
armed
to
the
teeth
approached
and
knocked
at
the
same
door
which
an
old
woman
immediately
opened
for
her
the
lady
raised
her
veil
as
she
entered
though
no
longer
beautiful
or
young
she
was
still
active
and
of
an
imposing
carriage
she
concealed
beneath
a
rich
toilette
and
the
most
exquisite
taste
an
age
which
ninon
de
l
enclos
alone
could
have
smiled
at
with
impunity
hardly
had
she
reached
the
vestibule
when
the
cavalier
whose
features
we
have
only
roughly
sketched
advanced
towards
her
holding
out
his
hand
good
day
my
dear
duchesse
he
said
how
do
you
do
my
dear
aramis
replied
the
duchesse
he
led
her
to
a
most
elegantly
furnished
apartment
on
whose
high
windows
were
reflected
the
expiring
rays
of
the
setting
sun
which
filtered
gaudily
through
the
dark
green
needles
of
the
adjacent
firs
they
sat
down
side
by
side
neither
of
them
thought
of
asking
for
additional
light
in
the
room
and
they
buried
themselves
as
it
were
in
the
shadow
as
if
they
wished
to
bury
themselves
in
forgetfulness
chevalier
said
the
duchesse
you
have
never
given
me
a
single
sign
of
life
since
our
interview
at
fontainebleau
and
i
confess
that
your
presence
there
on
the
day
of
the
franciscan
s
death
and
your
initiation
in
certain
secrets
caused
me
the
liveliest
astonishment
i
ever
experienced
in
my
whole
i
can
explain
my
presence
there
to
you
as
well
as
my
initiation
said
aramis
but
let
us
first
of
all
said
the
duchess
talk
a
little
of
ourselves
for
our
friendship
is
by
no
means
of
recent
yes
madame
and
if
heaven
wills
it
we
shall
continue
to
be
friends
i
will
not
say
for
a
long
time
but
that
is
quite
certain
chevalier
and
my
visit
is
a
proof
of
our
interests
duchess
are
no
longer
the
same
as
they
used
to
be
said
aramis
smiling
without
apprehension
in
the
growing
gloom
by
which
the
room
was
overcast
for
it
could
not
reveal
that
his
smile
was
less
agreeable
and
not
so
bright
as
formerly
no
chevalier
at
the
present
day
we
have
other
interests
every
period
of
life
brings
its
own
and
as
we
now
understand
each
other
in
conversing
as
perfectly
as
we
formerly
did
without
saying
a
word
let
us
talk
if
you
i
am
at
your
orders
duchesse
ah
i
beg
your
pardon
how
did
you
obtain
my
address
and
what
was
your
object
you
ask
me
why
i
have
told
you
curiosity
in
the
first
place
i
wished
to
know
what
you
could
have
to
do
with
the
franciscan
with
whom
i
had
certain
business
transactions
and
who
died
so
singularly
you
know
that
on
the
occasion
of
our
interview
at
fontainebleau
in
the
cemetery
at
the
foot
of
the
grave
so
recently
closed
we
were
both
so
much
overcome
by
our
emotions
that
we
omitted
to
confide
to
each
other
what
we
may
have
to
yes
well
then
i
had
no
sooner
left
you
than
i
repented
and
have
ever
since
been
most
anxious
to
ascertain
the
truth
you
know
that
madame
de
longueville
and
myself
are
almost
one
i
suppose
i
was
not
aware
said
aramis
discreetly
i
remembered
therefore
continued
the
duchesse
that
neither
of
us
said
anything
to
the
other
in
the
cemetery
that
you
did
not
speak
of
the
relationship
in
which
you
stood
to
the
franciscan
whose
burial
you
superintended
and
that
i
did
not
refer
to
the
position
in
which
i
stood
to
him
all
which
seemed
very
unworthy
of
two
such
old
friends
as
ourselves
and
i
have
sought
an
opportunity
of
an
interview
with
you
in
order
to
give
you
some
information
that
i
have
recently
acquired
and
to
assure
you
that
marie
michon
now
no
more
has
left
behind
her
one
who
has
preserved
her
recollection
of
aramis
bowed
over
the
duchess
s
hand
and
pressed
his
lips
upon
it
you
must
have
had
some
trouble
to
find
me
again
he
said
yes
she
answered
annoyed
to
find
the
subject
taking
a
turn
which
aramis
wished
to
give
it
but
i
knew
you
were
a
friend
of
fouquet
s
and
so
i
inquired
in
that
a
friend
oh
exclaimed
the
chevalier
i
can
hardly
pretend
to
be
a
poor
priest
who
has
been
favored
by
a
generous
protector
and
whose
heart
is
full
of
gratitude
and
devotion
is
all
that
i
pretend
to
be
to
he
made
you
a
bishop
yes
a
very
good
retiring
pension
for
so
handsome
a
yes
in
the
same
way
that
political
intrigue
is
for
yourself
thought
aramis
and
so
he
added
you
inquired
after
me
at
fouquet
s
easily
enough
you
had
been
to
fontainebleau
with
him
and
had
undertaken
a
voyage
to
your
diocese
which
is
i
no
madame
said
aramis
my
diocese
is
i
meant
that
i
only
thought
that
is
a
property
belonging
to
fouquet
nothing
ah
i
had
been
told
that
was
fortified
besides
i
know
how
great
the
military
knowledge
is
you
i
have
forgotten
everything
of
the
kind
since
i
entered
the
church
said
aramis
annoyed
suffice
it
to
know
that
i
learned
you
had
returned
from
vannes
and
i
sent
off
to
one
of
our
friends
le
comte
de
la
fere
who
is
discretion
itself
in
order
to
ascertain
it
but
he
answered
that
he
was
not
aware
of
your
so
like
athos
thought
the
bishop
the
really
good
man
never
well
then
you
know
that
i
can
not
venture
to
show
myself
here
and
that
the
has
always
some
grievance
or
other
against
yes
indeed
and
i
am
surprised
at
oh
there
are
various
reasons
for
it
but
to
continue
being
obliged
to
conceal
myself
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
meet
with
d
artagnan
who
was
formerly
one
of
your
old
friends
i
believe
a
friend
of
mine
still
he
gave
me
certain
information
and
sent
me
to
baisemeaux
the
governor
of
the
aramis
was
somewhat
agitated
at
this
remark
and
a
light
flashed
from
his
eyes
in
the
darkness
of
the
room
which
he
could
not
conceal
from
his
friend
m
de
baisemeaux
he
said
why
did
d
artagnan
send
you
to
de
baisemeaux
i
can
not
tell
what
can
this
possibly
mean
said
the
bishop
summoning
all
the
resources
of
his
mind
to
his
aid
in
order
to
carry
on
the
combat
in
a
befitting
manner
m
de
baisemeaux
is
greatly
indebted
to
you
d
artagnan
told
true
he
is
and
the
address
of
a
creditor
is
as
easily
ascertained
as
that
of
a
very
true
and
so
baisemeaux
indicated
to
you
where
i
forwarded
a
letter
to
which
i
have
in
my
hand
and
which
is
most
precious
to
me
said
aramis
because
i
am
indebted
to
it
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
the
duchesse
satisfied
at
having
successfully
overcome
the
various
difficulties
of
so
delicate
an
explanation
began
to
breathe
freely
again
which
aramis
however
could
not
succeed
in
doing
we
had
got
as
far
as
your
visit
to
baisemeaux
i
believe
nay
she
said
laughing
farther
than
in
that
case
we
must
have
been
speaking
about
the
grudge
you
have
against
the
further
still
she
returned
further
still
we
were
talking
of
the
connection
which
existed
between
you
and
the
franciscan
said
aramis
interrupting
her
eagerly
well
i
am
listening
to
you
very
it
is
easily
explained
returned
the
duchesse
you
know
that
i
am
living
at
brussels
with
de
laicques
i
heard
you
know
that
my
children
have
ruined
and
stripped
me
of
how
terrible
dear
terrible
indeed
this
obliged
me
to
resort
to
some
means
of
obtaining
a
livelihood
and
particularly
to
avoid
vegetating
for
the
remainder
of
my
existence
i
had
old
hatreds
to
turn
to
account
old
friendships
to
make
use
of
i
no
longer
had
either
credit
or
who
had
extended
protection
towards
so
many
persons
said
aramis
softly
it
is
always
the
case
chevalier
well
at
the
present
time
i
am
in
the
habit
of
seeing
the
king
of
spain
very
ah
who
has
just
nominated
a
general
of
the
jesuits
according
to
the
usual
is
it
usual
indeed
were
you
not
aware
of
it
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
you
must
be
aware
of
that
you
who
were
on
such
good
terms
with
the
with
the
general
of
the
jesuits
you
mean
exactly
well
then
i
have
seen
the
king
of
spain
who
wished
to
do
me
a
service
but
was
unable
he
gave
me
recommendations
however
to
flanders
both
for
myself
and
for
laicques
too
and
conferred
a
pension
on
me
out
of
the
funds
belonging
to
the
of
jesuits
yes
the
general
i
mean
the
franciscan
was
sent
to
me
and
for
the
purpose
of
conforming
with
the
requisitions
of
the
statues
of
the
order
and
of
entitling
me
to
the
pension
i
was
reputed
to
be
in
a
position
to
render
certain
services
you
are
aware
that
that
is
the
rule
no
i
did
not
know
it
said
aramis
madame
de
chevreuse
paused
to
look
at
aramis
but
it
was
perfectly
dark
well
such
is
the
rule
however
she
resumed
i
had
therefore
to
appear
to
possess
a
power
of
usefulness
of
some
kind
or
other
and
i
proposed
to
travel
for
the
order
and
i
was
placed
on
the
list
of
affiliated
travelers
you
understand
it
was
a
formality
by
means
of
which
i
received
my
pension
which
was
very
convenient
for
good
heavens
duchesse
what
you
tell
me
is
like
a
obliged
to
receive
a
pension
from
the
jesuits
no
chevalier
from
except
for
a
conscientious
scruple
duchesse
you
will
admit
that
it
is
pretty
nearly
the
same
no
not
at
but
surely
of
your
magnificent
fortune
there
must
remain
dampierre
is
all
that
and
that
is
handsome
yes
but
dampierre
is
burdened
mortgaged
and
almost
fallen
to
ruin
like
its
and
can
the
know
and
see
all
that
without
shedding
a
tear
said
aramis
with
a
penetrating
look
which
encountered
nothing
but
darkness
yes
she
has
forgotten
you
i
believe
attempted
to
get
restored
to
favor
yes
but
most
singularly
the
young
king
inherits
the
antipathy
his
dear
father
had
for
me
you
will
perhaps
tell
me
that
i
am
indeed
a
woman
to
be
hated
and
that
i
am
no
longer
one
who
can
be
dear
duchesse
pray
come
quickly
to
the
cause
that
brought
you
here
for
i
think
we
can
be
of
service
to
each
such
has
been
my
own
thought
i
came
to
fontainebleau
with
a
double
object
in
view
in
the
first
place
i
was
summoned
there
by
the
franciscan
whom
you
knew
by
the
by
how
did
you
know
him
for
i
have
told
you
my
story
and
have
not
yet
heard
i
knew
him
in
a
very
natural
way
duchesse
i
studied
theology
with
him
at
parma
we
became
fast
friends
and
it
happened
from
time
to
time
that
business
or
travel
or
war
separated
us
from
each
you
were
of
course
aware
that
he
was
the
general
of
the
jesuits
i
suspected
but
by
what
extraordinary
chance
did
it
happen
that
you
were
at
the
hotel
when
the
affiliated
travelers
met
together
oh
said
aramis
in
a
calm
voice
it
was
the
merest
chance
in
the
world
i
was
going
to
fontainebleau
to
see
fouquet
for
the
purpose
of
obtaining
an
audience
of
the
king
i
was
passing
by
unknown
i
saw
the
poor
dying
monk
in
the
road
and
recognized
him
immediately
you
know
the
rest
he
died
in
my
yes
but
bequeathing
to
you
so
vast
a
power
that
you
issue
your
sovereign
orders
and
directions
like
a
he
certainly
did
leave
me
a
few
commissions
to
and
what
for
me
i
have
told
you
a
sum
of
twelve
thousand
livres
was
to
be
paid
to
you
i
thought
i
had
given
you
the
necessary
signature
to
enable
you
to
receive
it
did
you
not
get
the
money
oh
yes
yes
you
give
your
orders
i
am
informed
with
so
much
mystery
and
such
a
majestic
presence
that
it
is
generally
believed
you
are
the
successor
of
the
defunct
aramis
colored
impatiently
and
the
duchesse
continued
i
have
obtained
my
information
she
said
from
the
king
of
spain
himself
and
he
cleared
up
some
of
my
doubts
on
the
point
every
general
of
the
jesuits
is
nominated
by
him
and
must
be
a
spaniard
according
to
the
statutes
of
the
order
you
are
not
a
spaniard
nor
have
you
been
nominated
by
the
king
of
aramis
did
not
reply
to
this
remark
except
to
say
you
see
duchesse
how
greatly
you
were
mistaken
since
the
king
of
spain
told
you
yes
my
dear
aramis
but
there
was
something
else
which
i
have
been
thinking
what
is
that
you
know
i
believe
something
about
most
things
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
you
know
the
spanish
every
frenchman
who
has
been
actively
engaged
in
the
fronde
knows
you
have
lived
in
flanders
three
and
have
stayed
at
madrid
fifteen
you
are
in
a
position
then
to
become
a
naturalized
spaniard
when
you
really
said
aramis
with
a
frankness
which
deceived
the
duchesse
undoubtedly
two
years
residence
and
an
acquaintance
with
the
language
are
indispensable
you
have
upwards
of
four
years
more
than
double
the
time
what
are
you
driving
at
duchesse
at
this
i
am
on
good
terms
with
the
king
of
and
i
am
not
on
bad
terms
thought
aramis
to
himself
shall
i
ask
the
king
continued
the
duchesse
to
confer
the
succession
to
the
franciscan
s
post
upon
you
oh
duchesse
you
have
it
already
perhaps
she
said
no
upon
my
very
well
then
i
can
render
you
that
why
did
you
not
render
the
same
service
to
de
laicques
duchesse
he
is
a
very
talented
man
and
one
you
love
yes
no
doubt
but
at
all
events
putting
laicques
aside
will
you
have
it
no
i
thank
you
she
paused
he
is
nominated
she
thought
and
then
resumed
aloud
if
you
refuse
me
in
this
manner
it
is
not
very
encouraging
for
me
supposing
i
should
have
something
to
ask
of
oh
ask
pray
ask
i
can
not
do
so
if
you
have
not
the
power
to
grant
what
i
however
limited
my
power
and
ability
ask
all
the
i
need
a
sum
of
money
to
restore
ah
replied
aramis
coldly
money
well
duchesse
how
much
would
you
require
oh
a
tolerably
round
so
much
the
worse
you
know
i
am
not
no
no
but
the
order
is
and
if
you
had
been
the
general
you
know
i
am
not
the
general
i
in
that
case
you
have
a
friend
who
must
be
very
wealthy
m
fouquet
he
is
more
than
half
ruined
so
it
is
said
but
i
did
not
believe
why
duchesse
because
i
have
or
rather
laicques
has
certain
letters
in
his
possession
from
cardinal
mazarin
which
establish
the
existence
of
very
strange
what
accounts
relative
to
various
sums
of
money
borrowed
and
disposed
of
i
can
not
very
distinctly
remember
what
they
are
but
they
establish
the
fact
that
the
superintendent
according
to
these
letters
which
are
signed
by
mazarin
had
taken
thirteen
millions
of
francs
from
the
coffers
of
the
state
the
case
is
a
very
serious
aramis
clenched
his
hands
in
anxiety
and
apprehension
is
it
possible
he
said
that
you
have
such
letters
as
you
speak
of
and
have
not
communicated
them
to
fouquet
ah
replied
the
duchesse
i
keep
such
trifling
matters
as
these
in
reserve
the
day
may
come
when
they
will
be
of
service
and
they
can
be
withdrawn
from
the
safe
custody
in
which
they
now
and
that
day
has
arrived
said
aramis
and
you
are
going
to
show
those
letters
to
fouquet
i
prefer
to
talk
about
them
with
you
you
must
be
in
sad
want
of
money
my
poor
friend
to
think
of
such
things
as
these
you
too
who
held
de
mazarin
s
prose
effusions
in
such
indifferent
the
fact
is
i
am
in
want
of
and
then
continued
aramis
in
cold
accents
it
must
have
been
very
distressing
to
you
to
be
obliged
to
have
recourse
to
such
a
means
it
is
oh
if
had
wished
to
do
harm
instead
of
good
said
madame
de
chevreuse
instead
of
asking
the
general
of
the
order
or
fouquet
for
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
i
require
i
hundred
thousand
francs
yes
no
more
do
you
think
it
much
i
require
at
least
as
much
as
that
to
restore
yes
i
say
therefore
that
instead
of
asking
for
this
amount
i
should
have
gone
to
see
my
old
friend
the
the
letters
from
her
husband
signor
mazarini
would
have
served
me
as
an
introduction
and
i
should
have
begged
this
mere
trifle
of
her
saying
to
her
i
wish
madame
to
have
the
honor
of
receiving
you
at
dampierre
permit
me
to
put
dampierre
in
a
fit
state
for
that
aramis
did
not
return
a
single
word
well
she
said
what
are
you
thinking
about
i
am
making
certain
additions
said
aramis
and
fouquet
subtractions
i
on
the
other
hand
am
trying
my
hand
at
the
art
of
multiplication
what
excellent
calculators
we
all
three
are
how
well
we
might
understand
one
another
will
you
allow
me
to
reflect
said
aramis
no
for
with
such
an
opening
between
people
like
ourselves
yes
or
no
is
the
only
answer
and
that
an
immediate
it
is
a
snare
thought
the
bishop
it
is
impossible
that
anne
of
austria
would
listen
to
such
a
woman
as
well
said
the
duchesse
well
madame
i
should
be
very
much
astonished
if
fouquet
had
five
hundred
thousand
francs
at
his
disposal
at
the
present
it
is
no
use
speaking
of
it
then
said
the
duchesse
and
dampierre
must
get
restored
how
best
it
oh
you
are
not
embarrassed
to
such
an
extent
as
that
i
no
i
am
never
and
the
queen
continued
the
bishop
will
certainly
do
for
you
what
the
superintendent
is
unable
to
do
oh
certainly
but
tell
me
do
you
think
it
would
be
better
that
i
should
speak
myself
to
fouquet
about
these
letters
nay
duchesse
you
will
do
precisely
whatever
you
please
in
that
respect
fouquet
either
feels
or
does
not
feel
himself
to
be
guilty
if
he
really
be
so
i
know
he
is
proud
enough
not
to
confess
it
if
he
be
not
so
he
will
be
exceedingly
offended
at
your
as
usual
you
reason
like
an
angel
said
the
duchesse
as
she
rose
from
her
seat
and
so
you
are
now
going
to
denounce
fouquet
to
the
queen
said
aramis
denounce
oh
what
a
disagreeable
word
i
shall
not
denounce
my
dear
friend
you
know
matters
of
policy
too
well
to
be
ignorant
how
easily
these
affairs
are
arranged
i
shall
merely
side
against
fouquet
and
nothing
more
and
in
a
war
of
party
against
party
a
weapon
is
always
a
no
and
once
on
friendly
terms
again
with
the
i
may
be
dangerous
towards
some
you
are
at
liberty
to
prove
so
a
liberty
of
which
i
shall
avail
you
are
not
ignorant
i
suppose
duchesse
that
fouquet
is
on
the
best
terms
with
the
king
of
i
suppose
if
therefore
you
begin
a
party
warfare
against
fouquet
he
will
reply
in
the
same
way
for
he
too
is
at
perfect
liberty
to
do
so
is
he
not
oh
and
as
he
is
on
good
terms
with
spain
he
will
make
use
of
that
friendship
as
a
weapon
of
you
mean
that
he
is
naturally
on
good
terms
with
the
general
of
the
order
of
the
jesuits
my
dear
that
may
be
the
case
and
that
consequently
the
pension
i
have
been
receiving
from
the
order
will
be
i
am
greatly
afraid
it
might
well
i
must
contrive
to
console
myself
in
the
best
way
i
can
for
after
richelieu
after
the
fronde
after
exile
what
is
there
left
for
madame
de
chevreuse
to
be
afraid
of
the
pension
you
are
aware
is
thousand
alas
i
am
quite
aware
of
moreover
in
party
contests
you
know
the
friends
of
one
s
enemy
do
not
ah
you
mean
that
poor
laicques
will
have
to
i
am
afraid
it
is
almost
inevitable
oh
he
only
receives
twelve
thousand
francs
yes
but
the
king
of
spain
has
some
influence
left
advised
by
fouquet
he
might
get
laicques
shut
up
in
prison
for
a
little
i
am
not
very
nervous
on
that
point
my
dear
friend
because
once
reconciled
with
anne
of
austria
i
will
undertake
that
france
would
insist
upon
laicques
s
true
in
that
case
you
will
have
something
else
to
what
can
that
be
said
the
duchesse
pretending
to
be
surprised
and
terrified
you
will
learn
indeed
you
must
know
it
already
that
having
once
been
an
affiliated
member
of
the
order
it
is
not
easy
to
leave
it
for
the
secrets
that
any
particular
member
may
have
acquired
are
unwholesome
and
carry
with
them
the
germs
of
misfortune
for
whosoever
may
reveal
the
duchesse
paused
and
reflected
for
a
moment
and
then
said
that
is
more
serious
i
will
think
it
and
notwithstanding
the
profound
obscurity
aramis
seemed
to
feel
a
basilisk
glance
like
a
iron
escape
from
his
friend
s
eyes
and
plunge
into
his
heart
let
us
recapitulate
said
aramis
determined
to
keep
himself
on
his
guard
and
gliding
his
hand
into
his
breast
where
he
had
a
dagger
concealed
exactly
let
us
recapitulate
short
accounts
make
long
the
suppression
of
your
pension
thousand
francs
and
that
of
laicques
s
twelve
make
together
sixty
thousand
francs
that
is
what
you
mean
i
suppose
precisely
and
i
was
trying
to
find
out
what
would
be
your
equivalent
for
five
hundred
thousand
francs
which
i
shall
get
from
the
or
which
you
will
i
know
a
means
of
procuring
them
said
the
duchesse
thoughtlessly
this
remark
made
the
chevalier
prick
up
his
ears
and
from
the
moment
his
adversary
had
committed
this
error
his
mind
was
so
thoroughly
on
its
guard
that
he
seemed
every
moment
to
gain
the
advantage
more
and
more
and
she
consequently
to
lose
it
i
will
admit
for
argument
s
sake
that
you
obtain
the
money
he
resumed
you
will
lose
twice
as
much
having
a
hundred
thousand
francs
pension
to
receive
instead
of
sixty
thousand
and
that
for
a
period
of
ten
not
so
for
i
shall
only
be
subjected
to
this
reduction
of
my
income
during
the
period
of
fouquet
s
remaining
in
power
a
period
which
i
estimate
at
two
ah
said
aramis
i
am
frank
you
i
thank
you
for
it
duchesse
but
you
would
be
wrong
to
suppose
that
after
fouquet
s
disgrace
the
order
would
resume
the
payment
of
your
i
know
a
means
of
making
the
order
pay
as
i
know
a
means
of
forcing
the
to
concede
what
i
in
that
case
duchesse
we
are
all
obliged
to
strike
our
flags
to
you
the
victory
is
yours
and
the
triumph
also
be
clement
i
entreat
but
is
it
possible
resumed
the
duchesse
without
taking
notice
of
the
irony
that
you
really
draw
back
from
a
miserable
sum
of
five
hundred
thousand
francs
when
it
is
a
question
of
sparing
you
i
mean
your
friend
i
beg
your
pardon
i
ought
rather
to
say
your
protector
the
disagreeable
consequences
which
a
party
contest
produces
duchesse
i
tell
you
why
supposing
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
were
to
be
given
you
laicques
will
require
his
share
which
will
be
another
five
hundred
thousand
francs
i
presume
and
then
after
de
laicques
s
and
your
own
portions
have
been
arranged
the
portions
which
your
children
your
poor
pensioners
and
various
other
persons
will
require
will
start
up
as
fresh
claims
and
these
letters
however
compromising
they
may
be
in
their
nature
are
not
worth
from
three
to
four
millions
can
you
have
forgotten
the
queen
of
france
s
diamonds
they
were
surely
worth
more
than
these
bits
of
waste
paper
signed
by
mazarin
and
yet
their
recovery
did
not
cost
a
fourth
part
of
what
you
ask
for
yes
that
is
true
but
the
merchant
values
his
goods
at
his
own
price
and
it
is
for
the
purchaser
to
buy
or
stay
a
moment
duchesse
would
you
like
me
to
tell
you
why
i
will
not
buy
your
letters
pray
tell
because
the
letters
you
claim
to
be
mazarin
s
are
what
an
i
have
no
doubt
of
it
for
it
would
to
say
the
least
be
very
singular
that
after
you
had
quarreled
with
the
queen
through
mazarin
s
means
you
should
have
kept
up
any
intimate
acquaintance
with
the
latter
it
would
look
as
if
you
had
been
acting
as
a
spy
and
upon
my
word
i
do
not
like
to
make
use
of
the
oh
pray
you
great
complacence
would
seem
suspicions
at
all
that
is
quite
true
but
the
contents
of
the
letters
are
even
more
i
pledge
you
my
word
duchesse
that
you
will
not
be
able
to
make
use
of
it
with
the
oh
yes
indeed
i
can
make
use
of
everything
with
the
very
good
thought
aramis
croak
on
old
owl
hiss
but
the
duchesse
had
said
enough
and
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
the
door
aramis
however
had
reserved
one
exposure
which
she
did
expect
he
rang
the
bell
candles
immediately
appeared
in
the
adjoining
room
and
the
bishop
found
himself
completely
encircled
by
lights
which
shone
upon
the
worn
haggard
face
of
the
duchesse
revealing
every
feature
but
too
clearly
aramis
fixed
a
long
ironical
look
upon
her
pale
thin
withered
cheeks
her
dim
dull
eyes
and
upon
her
lips
which
she
kept
carefully
closed
over
her
discolored
scanty
teeth
he
however
had
thrown
himself
into
a
graceful
attitude
with
his
haughty
and
intelligent
head
thrown
back
he
smiled
so
as
to
reveal
teeth
still
brilliant
and
dazzling
the
antiquated
coquette
understood
the
trick
that
had
been
played
her
she
was
standing
immediately
before
a
large
mirror
in
which
her
decrepitude
so
carefully
concealed
was
only
made
more
manifest
and
thereupon
without
even
saluting
aramis
who
bowed
with
the
ease
and
grace
of
the
musketeer
of
early
days
she
hurried
away
with
trembling
steps
which
her
very
precipitation
only
the
more
impeded
aramis
sprang
across
the
room
like
a
zephyr
to
lead
her
to
the
door
madame
de
chevreuse
made
a
sign
to
her
servant
who
resumed
his
musket
and
she
left
the
house
where
such
tender
friends
had
not
been
able
to
understand
each
other
only
because
they
had
understood
each
other
too
well
chapter
xli
wherein
may
be
seen
that
a
bargain
which
can
not
be
made
with
one
person
can
be
carried
out
with
another
aramis
had
been
perfectly
correct
in
his
supposition
for
hardly
had
she
left
the
house
in
the
place
baudoyer
than
madame
de
chevreuse
proceeded
homeward
she
was
doubtless
afraid
of
being
followed
and
by
this
means
thought
she
might
succeed
in
throwing
those
who
might
be
following
her
off
their
guard
but
scarcely
had
she
arrived
within
the
door
of
the
hotel
and
hardly
had
assured
herself
that
no
one
who
could
cause
her
any
uneasiness
was
on
her
track
when
she
opened
the
door
of
the
garden
leading
into
another
street
and
hurried
towards
the
rue
croix
des
where
colbert
resided
we
have
already
said
that
evening
or
rather
night
had
closed
in
it
was
a
dark
thick
night
besides
paris
had
once
more
sunk
into
its
calm
quiescent
state
enshrouding
alike
within
its
indulgent
mantle
the
duchesse
carrying
out
her
political
intrigue
and
the
simple
citizen
s
wife
who
having
been
detained
late
by
a
supper
in
the
city
was
making
her
way
slowly
homewards
hanging
on
the
arm
of
a
lover
by
the
shortest
possible
route
madame
de
chevreuse
had
been
too
well
accustomed
to
nocturnal
political
intrigues
to
be
ignorant
that
a
minister
never
denies
himself
even
at
his
own
private
residence
to
any
young
and
beautiful
woman
who
may
chance
to
object
to
the
dust
and
confusion
of
a
public
office
or
to
old
women
as
full
of
experience
as
of
years
who
dislike
the
indiscreet
echo
of
official
residences
a
valet
received
the
duchesse
under
the
peristyle
and
received
her
it
must
be
admitted
with
some
indifference
of
manner
he
intimated
after
having
looked
at
her
face
that
it
was
hardly
at
such
an
hour
that
one
so
advanced
in
years
as
herself
could
be
permitted
to
disturb
monsieur
colbert
s
important
occupations
but
madame
de
chevreuse
without
looking
or
appearing
to
be
annoyed
wrote
her
name
upon
a
leaf
of
her
tablets
a
name
which
had
but
too
frequently
sounded
so
disagreeably
in
the
ears
of
louis
xiii
and
of
the
great
cardinal
she
wrote
her
name
in
the
large
characters
of
the
higher
classes
of
that
period
handed
it
to
the
valet
without
uttering
a
word
but
with
so
haughty
and
imperious
a
gesture
that
the
fellow
well
accustomed
to
judge
of
people
from
their
manners
and
appearance
perceived
at
once
the
quality
of
the
person
before
him
bowed
his
head
and
ran
to
colbert
s
room
the
minister
could
not
control
a
sudden
exclamation
as
he
opened
the
paper
and
the
valet
gathering
from
it
the
interest
with
which
his
master
regarded
the
mysterious
visitor
returned
as
fast
as
he
could
to
beg
the
duchesse
to
follow
him
she
ascended
to
the
first
floor
of
the
beautiful
new
house
very
slowly
rested
herself
on
the
in
order
not
to
enter
the
apartment
out
of
breath
and
appeared
before
colbert
who
with
his
own
hands
held
both
the
folding
doors
open
the
duchesse
paused
at
the
threshold
for
the
purpose
of
well
studying
the
character
of
the
man
with
whom
she
was
about
to
converse
at
the
first
glance
the
round
large
heavy
head
thick
brows
and
features
of
colbert
who
wore
thrust
low
down
on
his
head
a
cap
like
a
priest
s
seemed
to
indicate
that
but
little
difficulty
was
likely
to
be
met
with
in
her
negotiations
with
him
but
also
that
she
was
to
expect
as
little
interest
in
the
discussion
of
particulars
for
there
was
scarcely
any
indication
that
the
rough
and
uncouth
nature
of
the
man
was
susceptible
to
the
impulses
of
a
refined
revenge
or
of
an
exalted
ambition
but
when
on
closer
inspection
the
duchesse
perceived
the
small
piercingly
black
eyes
the
longitudinal
wrinkles
of
his
high
and
massive
forehead
the
imperceptible
twitching
of
the
lips
on
which
were
apparent
traces
of
rough
madame
de
chevreuse
altered
her
opinion
of
him
and
felt
she
could
say
to
herself
i
have
found
the
man
i
what
is
the
subject
madame
which
procures
me
the
honor
of
a
visit
from
you
he
inquired
the
need
i
have
of
you
monsieur
returned
the
duchesse
as
well
as
that
which
you
have
of
i
am
delighted
madame
with
the
first
portion
of
your
sentence
but
as
far
as
the
second
portion
is
concerned
madame
de
chevreuse
sat
down
in
the
armchair
which
colbert
advanced
towards
her
monsieur
colbert
you
are
the
intendant
of
finances
and
are
ambitious
of
becoming
the
superintendent
madame
nay
do
not
deny
it
that
would
only
unnecessarily
prolong
our
conversation
and
that
is
and
yet
madame
however
and
inclined
to
show
politeness
i
may
be
towards
a
lady
of
your
position
and
merit
nothing
will
make
me
confess
that
i
have
ever
entertained
the
idea
of
supplanting
my
i
said
nothing
about
supplanting
monsieur
colbert
could
i
accidentally
have
made
use
of
that
word
i
hardly
think
that
likely
the
word
replace
is
less
aggressive
in
its
signification
and
more
grammatically
suitable
as
de
voiture
would
say
i
presume
therefore
that
you
are
ambitious
of
replacing
m
fouquet
s
fortune
madame
enables
him
to
withstand
all
attempts
the
superintendent
in
this
age
plays
the
part
of
the
colossus
of
rhodes
the
vessels
pass
beneath
him
and
do
not
overthrow
i
ought
to
have
availed
myself
precisely
of
that
very
comparison
it
is
true
fouquet
plays
the
part
of
the
colossus
of
rhodes
but
i
remember
to
have
heard
it
said
by
conrart
a
member
of
the
academy
i
believe
that
when
the
colossus
of
rhodes
fell
from
its
lofty
position
the
merchant
who
had
cast
it
down
a
merchant
nothing
more
colbert
loaded
four
hundred
camels
with
the
ruins
a
merchant
and
that
is
considerably
less
than
an
intendant
of
madame
i
can
assure
you
that
i
shall
never
overthrow
very
good
monsieur
colbert
since
you
persist
in
showing
so
much
sensitiveness
with
me
as
if
you
were
ignorant
that
i
am
madame
de
chevreuse
and
also
that
i
am
somewhat
advanced
in
years
in
other
words
that
you
have
to
do
with
a
woman
who
has
had
political
dealings
with
the
cardinal
richelieu
and
who
has
no
time
to
lose
as
i
repeat
you
do
not
hesitate
to
commit
such
an
imprudence
i
shall
go
and
find
others
who
are
more
intelligent
and
more
desirous
of
making
their
how
madame
how
you
give
me
a
very
poor
idea
of
negotiations
of
the
present
day
i
assure
you
that
if
in
my
earlier
days
a
woman
had
gone
to
de
who
was
not
moreover
a
man
of
a
very
high
order
of
intellect
and
had
said
to
him
about
the
cardinal
what
i
have
just
said
to
you
of
fouquet
de
would
by
this
time
have
already
set
actively
to
nay
madame
show
a
little
indulgence
i
entreat
well
then
do
you
really
consent
to
replace
fouquet
certainly
i
do
if
the
king
dismisses
again
a
word
too
much
it
is
quite
evident
that
if
you
have
not
yet
succeeded
in
driving
fouquet
from
his
post
it
is
because
you
have
not
been
able
to
do
so
therefore
i
should
be
the
greatest
simpleton
possible
if
in
coming
to
you
i
did
not
bring
the
very
thing
you
i
am
distressed
to
be
obliged
to
persist
madame
said
colbert
after
a
silence
which
enabled
the
duchesse
to
sound
the
depths
of
his
dissimulation
but
i
must
warn
you
that
for
the
last
six
years
denunciation
after
denunciation
has
been
made
against
fouquet
and
he
has
remained
unshaken
and
unaffected
by
there
is
a
time
for
everything
monsieur
colbert
those
who
were
the
authors
of
those
denunciations
were
not
called
madame
de
chevreuse
and
they
had
no
proofs
equal
to
the
six
letters
from
de
mazarin
which
establish
the
offense
in
the
offense
the
crime
if
you
like
it
the
crime
committed
by
fouquet
nothing
less
it
is
rather
strange
colbert
but
your
face
which
just
now
was
cold
and
indifferent
is
now
positively
the
very
a
crime
i
am
delighted
to
see
that
it
makes
an
impression
upon
it
is
because
that
word
madame
embraces
so
many
it
embraces
the
post
of
superintendent
of
finance
for
yourself
and
a
letter
of
exile
or
the
bastile
for
forgive
me
madame
la
duchesse
but
it
is
almost
impossible
that
fouquet
can
be
exiled
to
be
imprisoned
or
disgraced
that
is
already
a
great
oh
i
am
perfectly
aware
of
what
i
am
saying
returned
madame
de
chevreuse
coldly
i
do
not
live
at
such
a
distance
from
paris
as
not
to
know
what
takes
place
there
the
king
does
not
like
fouquet
and
he
would
willingly
sacrifice
fouquet
if
an
opportunity
were
only
given
it
must
be
a
good
one
good
enough
and
one
i
estimate
to
be
worth
five
hundred
thousand
in
what
way
said
colbert
i
mean
monsieur
that
holding
this
opportunity
in
my
own
hands
i
will
not
allow
it
to
be
transferred
to
yours
except
for
a
sum
of
five
hundred
thousand
i
understand
you
perfectly
madame
but
since
you
have
fixed
a
price
for
the
sale
let
me
now
see
the
value
of
the
articles
to
be
oh
a
mere
trifle
six
letters
as
i
have
already
told
you
from
de
mazarin
and
the
autographs
will
most
assuredly
not
be
regarded
as
too
highly
priced
if
they
establish
in
an
irrefutable
manner
that
fouquet
has
embezzled
large
sums
of
money
from
the
treasury
and
appropriated
them
to
his
own
in
an
irrefutable
manner
do
you
say
observed
colbert
whose
eyes
sparkled
with
delight
perfectly
so
would
you
like
to
read
the
letters
with
all
my
heart
copies
of
course
of
course
the
copies
said
the
duchesse
as
she
drew
from
her
bosom
a
small
packet
of
papers
flattened
by
her
velvet
bodice
read
she
said
colbert
eagerly
snatched
the
papers
and
devoured
them
excellent
he
said
it
is
clear
enough
is
it
not
yes
madame
yes
mazarin
must
have
handed
the
money
to
fouquet
who
must
have
kept
it
for
his
own
purposes
but
the
question
is
what
money
exactly
what
money
if
we
come
to
terms
i
will
join
to
these
six
letters
a
seventh
which
will
supply
you
with
the
fullest
colbert
reflected
and
the
originals
of
these
letters
a
useless
question
to
ask
exactly
as
if
i
were
to
ask
you
monsieur
colbert
whether
the
you
will
give
me
will
be
full
or
very
good
is
it
concluded
no
for
there
is
one
circumstance
to
which
neither
of
us
has
given
any
name
it
m
fouquet
can
be
utterly
ruined
under
the
legal
circumstances
you
have
detailed
only
by
means
of
legal
well
a
public
scandal
for
instance
and
yet
neither
the
legal
proceedings
nor
the
scandal
can
be
commenced
against
why
not
because
he
is
of
the
parliament
because
too
in
france
all
public
administrators
the
army
justice
itself
and
commerce
are
intimately
connected
by
ties
of
which
people
call
de
in
such
a
case
madame
the
parliament
will
never
permit
its
chief
to
be
dragged
before
a
public
tribunal
and
never
even
if
he
be
dragged
there
by
royal
authority
never
i
say
will
he
be
well
monsieur
colbert
i
do
not
see
what
i
have
to
do
with
i
am
aware
of
that
madame
but
i
have
to
do
with
it
and
it
consequently
diminishes
the
value
of
what
you
have
brought
to
show
me
what
good
can
a
proof
of
a
crime
be
to
me
without
the
possibility
of
obtaining
a
condemnation
even
if
he
be
only
suspected
fouquet
will
lose
his
post
of
is
that
all
exclaimed
colbert
whose
dark
gloomy
features
were
momentarily
lighted
up
by
an
expression
of
hate
and
vengeance
ah
ah
monsieur
colbert
said
the
duchesse
forgive
me
but
i
did
not
think
you
were
so
impressionable
very
good
in
that
case
since
you
need
more
than
i
have
to
give
you
there
is
no
occasion
to
speak
of
the
matter
at
yes
madame
we
will
go
on
talking
of
it
only
as
the
value
of
your
commodities
had
decreased
you
must
lower
your
you
are
bargaining
then
every
man
who
wishes
to
deal
loyally
is
obliged
to
do
how
much
will
you
offer
me
two
hundred
thousand
francs
said
colbert
the
duchesse
laughed
in
his
face
and
then
said
suddenly
wait
a
moment
i
have
another
arrangement
to
propose
will
you
give
me
three
hundred
thousand
francs
no
oh
you
can
either
accept
or
refuse
my
terms
besides
that
is
not
more
still
you
are
becoming
too
impracticable
to
deal
with
less
so
than
you
think
perhaps
for
it
is
not
money
i
am
going
to
ask
you
what
is
it
then
a
service
you
know
that
i
have
always
been
most
affectionately
attached
to
the
queen
and
i
am
desirous
of
having
an
interview
with
her
with
the
queen
yes
monsieur
colbert
with
the
queen
who
is
i
admit
no
longer
my
friend
and
who
has
ceased
to
be
so
for
a
long
time
past
but
who
may
again
become
so
if
the
opportunity
be
only
given
her
majesty
has
ceased
to
receive
any
one
madame
she
is
a
great
sufferer
and
you
may
be
aware
that
the
paroxysms
of
her
disease
occur
with
greater
frequency
than
that
is
the
very
reason
why
i
wish
to
have
an
interview
with
her
majesty
for
in
flanders
there
is
a
great
variety
of
these
kinds
of
what
cancers
a
fearful
incurable
disorder
do
not
believe
that
monsieur
colbert
the
flemish
peasant
is
somewhat
a
man
of
nature
and
his
companion
for
life
is
not
alone
a
wife
but
a
female
laborer
also
for
while
he
is
smoking
his
pipe
the
woman
works
it
is
she
who
draws
the
water
from
the
well
she
who
loads
the
mule
or
the
ass
and
even
bears
herself
a
portion
of
the
burden
taking
but
little
care
of
herself
she
gets
knocked
about
first
in
one
direction
and
then
in
another
and
very
often
is
beaten
by
her
husband
and
cancers
frequently
rise
from
true
true
said
colbert
the
flemish
women
do
not
die
the
sooner
on
that
account
when
they
are
great
sufferers
from
this
disease
they
go
in
search
of
remedies
and
the
beguines
of
bruges
are
excellent
doctors
for
every
kind
of
disease
they
have
precious
waters
of
one
sort
or
another
specifics
of
various
kinds
and
they
give
a
bottle
of
it
and
a
wax
candle
to
the
sufferer
whereby
the
priests
are
gainers
and
heaven
is
served
by
the
disposal
of
both
their
wares
i
will
take
the
queen
some
of
this
holy
water
which
i
will
procure
from
the
beguines
of
bruges
her
majesty
will
recover
and
will
burn
as
many
wax
candles
as
she
may
see
fit
you
see
monsieur
colbert
to
prevent
my
seeing
the
queen
is
almost
as
bad
as
committing
the
crime
of
you
are
undoubtedly
madame
la
duchesse
a
woman
of
exceedingly
great
abilities
and
i
am
more
than
astounded
at
their
display
still
i
can
not
but
suppose
that
this
charitable
consideration
towards
the
queen
in
some
measure
covers
a
slight
personal
interest
for
i
have
not
given
myself
the
trouble
to
conceal
it
that
i
am
aware
of
monsieur
colbert
you
said
i
believe
that
i
had
a
slight
personal
interest
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
very
great
interest
and
i
will
prove
it
to
you
by
resuming
what
i
was
saying
if
you
procure
me
a
personal
interview
with
her
majesty
i
will
be
satisfied
with
the
three
hundred
thousand
francs
i
have
claimed
if
not
i
shall
keep
my
letters
unless
indeed
you
give
me
on
the
spot
five
hundred
thousand
and
rising
from
her
seat
with
this
decisive
remark
the
old
duchesse
plunged
colbert
into
a
disagreeable
perplexity
to
bargain
any
further
was
out
of
the
question
and
not
to
bargain
was
to
pay
a
great
deal
too
dearly
for
them
madame
he
said
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
handing
over
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
but
how
shall
i
get
the
actual
letters
themselves
in
the
simplest
manner
in
the
world
my
dear
monsieur
colbert
whom
will
you
trust
the
financier
began
to
laugh
silently
so
that
his
large
eyebrows
went
up
and
down
like
the
wings
of
a
bat
upon
the
deep
lines
of
his
yellow
forehead
no
one
he
said
you
surely
will
make
an
exception
in
your
own
favor
monsieur
colbert
in
what
way
madame
i
mean
that
if
you
would
take
the
trouble
to
accompany
me
to
the
place
where
the
letters
are
they
would
be
delivered
into
your
own
hands
and
you
would
be
able
to
verify
and
check
quite
you
would
bring
the
hundred
thousand
crowns
with
you
at
the
same
time
for
i
too
do
not
trust
any
colbert
colored
to
the
tips
of
his
ears
like
all
eminent
men
in
the
art
of
figures
he
was
of
an
insolent
and
mathematical
probity
i
will
take
with
me
madame
he
said
two
orders
for
the
amount
agreed
upon
payable
at
my
treasury
will
that
satisfy
you
would
that
the
orders
on
your
treasury
were
for
two
millions
monsieur
l
intendant
i
shall
have
the
pleasure
of
showing
you
the
way
then
allow
me
to
order
my
carriage
i
have
a
carriage
below
colbert
coughed
like
an
irresolute
man
he
imagined
for
a
moment
that
the
proposition
of
the
duchesse
was
a
snare
that
perhaps
some
one
was
waiting
at
the
door
and
that
she
whose
secret
had
just
been
sold
to
colbert
for
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
had
already
offered
it
to
fouquet
for
the
same
sum
as
he
still
hesitated
the
duchesse
looked
at
him
full
in
the
face
you
prefer
your
own
carriage
she
said
i
admit
i
you
suppose
i
am
going
to
lead
you
into
a
snare
or
trap
of
some
sort
or
other
madame
la
duchesse
you
have
the
character
of
being
somewhat
inconsiderate
at
times
as
i
am
reputed
a
sober
solemn
character
a
jest
or
practical
joke
might
compromise
yes
the
fact
is
you
are
afraid
well
then
take
your
own
carriage
as
many
servants
as
you
like
only
think
well
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
what
we
two
may
arrange
between
ourselves
we
are
the
only
persons
who
will
know
if
a
third
person
is
present
we
might
as
well
tell
the
whole
world
about
it
after
all
i
do
not
make
a
point
of
it
my
carriage
shall
follow
yours
and
i
shall
be
satisfied
to
accompany
you
in
your
own
carriage
to
the
to
the
queen
have
you
forgotten
that
already
is
it
possible
that
one
of
the
clauses
of
the
agreement
of
so
much
importance
to
me
can
have
escaped
you
so
soon
how
trifling
it
seems
to
you
indeed
if
i
had
known
it
i
should
have
asked
double
what
i
have
i
have
reflected
madame
and
i
shall
not
accompany
really
and
why
not
because
i
have
the
most
perfect
confidence
in
you
overpower
me
but
provided
i
receive
the
hundred
thousand
crowns
here
they
are
madame
said
colbert
scribbling
a
few
lines
on
a
piece
of
paper
which
he
handed
to
the
duchesse
adding
you
are
the
trait
is
a
fine
one
monsieur
colbert
and
i
will
reward
you
for
it
she
said
beginning
to
laugh
madame
de
chevreuse
s
laugh
was
a
very
sinister
sound
a
man
with
youth
faith
love
life
itself
throbbing
in
his
heart
would
prefer
a
sob
to
such
a
lamentable
laugh
the
duchesse
opened
the
front
of
her
dress
and
drew
forth
from
her
bosom
somewhat
less
white
than
it
once
had
been
a
small
packet
of
papers
tied
with
a
ribbon
and
still
laughing
she
said
there
monsieur
colbert
are
the
originals
of
cardinal
mazarin
s
letters
they
are
now
your
own
property
she
added
refastening
the
body
of
her
dress
your
fortune
is
secured
and
now
accompany
me
to
the
no
madame
if
you
are
again
about
to
run
the
chance
of
her
majesty
s
displeasure
and
it
were
known
at
the
palais
royal
that
i
had
been
the
means
of
introducing
you
there
the
queen
would
never
forgive
me
while
she
lived
no
there
are
certain
persons
at
the
palace
who
are
devoted
to
me
who
will
procure
you
an
admission
without
my
being
just
as
you
please
provided
i
what
do
you
term
those
religious
women
at
bruges
who
cure
disorders
good
are
you
one
as
you
please
but
i
must
soon
cease
to
be
that
is
your
excuse
me
but
i
do
not
wish
to
be
exposed
to
a
that
is
again
your
own
affair
madame
i
am
going
to
give
directions
to
the
head
valet
of
the
gentleman
in
waiting
on
the
queen
to
allow
admission
to
a
beguine
who
brings
an
effectual
remedy
for
her
majesty
s
sufferings
you
are
the
bearer
of
my
letter
you
will
undertake
to
be
provided
with
the
remedy
and
will
give
every
explanation
on
the
subject
i
admit
a
knowledge
of
a
beguine
but
i
deny
all
knowledge
of
madame
de
chevreuse
here
madame
then
is
your
letter
of
chapter
xlii
the
skin
of
the
bear
colbert
handed
the
duchesse
the
letter
and
gently
drew
aside
the
chair
behind
which
she
was
standing
madame
de
chevreuse
with
a
very
slight
bow
immediately
left
the
room
colbert
who
had
recognized
mazarin
s
handwriting
and
had
counted
the
letters
rang
to
summon
his
secretary
whom
he
enjoined
to
go
in
immediate
search
of
vanel
a
counselor
of
the
parliament
the
secretary
replied
that
according
to
his
usual
practice
vanel
had
just
that
moment
entered
the
house
in
order
to
give
the
intendant
an
account
of
the
principal
details
of
the
business
which
had
been
transacted
during
the
day
in
parliament
colbert
approached
one
of
the
lamps
read
the
letters
of
the
deceased
cardinal
over
again
smiled
repeatedly
as
he
recognized
the
great
value
of
the
papers
madame
de
chevreuse
had
just
delivered
and
burying
his
head
in
his
hands
for
a
few
minutes
reflected
profoundly
in
the
meantime
a
tall
man
entered
the
room
his
spare
thin
face
steady
look
and
hooked
nose
as
he
entered
colbert
s
cabinet
with
a
modest
assurance
of
manner
revealed
a
character
at
once
supple
and
decided
supple
towards
the
master
who
could
throw
him
the
prey
firm
towards
the
dogs
who
might
possibly
be
disposed
to
dispute
its
possession
vanel
carried
a
voluminous
bundle
of
papers
under
his
arm
and
placed
it
on
the
desk
on
which
colbert
was
leaning
both
his
elbows
as
he
supported
his
head
good
day
vanel
said
the
latter
rousing
himself
from
his
meditation
good
day
monseigneur
said
vanel
naturally
you
should
say
monsieur
and
not
monseigneur
replied
colbert
gently
we
give
the
title
of
monseigneur
to
ministers
returned
vanel
with
extreme
and
you
are
a
not
you
are
so
in
point
of
fact
and
i
call
you
monseigneur
accordingly
besides
you
are
seigneur
for
and
that
is
sufficient
if
you
dislike
my
calling
you
monseigneur
before
others
allow
me
at
least
to
call
you
so
in
colbert
raised
his
head
as
if
to
read
or
try
to
read
upon
vanel
s
face
how
much
or
how
little
sincerity
entered
into
this
protestation
of
devotion
but
the
counselor
knew
perfectly
well
how
to
sustain
the
weight
of
such
a
look
even
backed
with
the
full
authority
of
the
title
he
had
conferred
colbert
sighed
he
could
not
read
anything
in
vanel
s
face
and
vanel
might
possibly
be
honest
in
his
professions
but
colbert
recollected
that
this
man
inferior
to
himself
in
every
other
respect
was
actually
his
master
in
virtue
of
the
fact
of
his
having
a
wife
as
he
was
pitying
this
man
s
lot
vanel
coldly
drew
from
his
pocket
a
perfumed
letter
sealed
with
spanish
wax
and
held
it
towards
colbert
saying
a
letter
from
my
wife
colbert
coughed
took
opened
and
read
the
letter
and
then
put
it
carefully
away
in
his
pocket
while
vanel
turned
over
the
leaves
of
the
papers
he
had
brought
with
him
with
an
unmoved
and
unconcerned
air
vanel
he
said
suddenly
to
his
you
are
a
man
i
know
would
twelve
hours
daily
labor
frighten
you
i
work
fifteen
hours
every
impossible
a
counselor
need
not
work
more
than
three
hours
a
day
in
oh
i
am
working
up
some
returns
for
a
friend
of
mine
in
the
department
of
accounts
and
as
i
still
have
spare
time
on
my
hands
i
am
studying
your
reputation
stands
high
in
the
parliament
i
believe
so
you
must
not
grow
rusty
in
your
post
of
what
must
i
do
to
avoid
it
purchase
a
high
place
mean
and
low
ambitions
are
very
difficult
to
small
purses
are
the
most
difficult
ones
to
fill
what
post
have
you
in
view
said
colbert
i
see
none
not
there
is
one
certainly
but
one
need
be
almost
the
king
himself
to
be
able
to
buy
it
without
inconvenience
and
the
king
will
not
be
inclined
i
suppose
to
purchase
the
post
of
at
these
words
vanel
fixed
his
peculiar
humble
dull
look
upon
colbert
who
could
hardly
tell
whether
vanel
comprehended
him
or
not
why
do
you
speak
to
me
monseigneur
said
vanel
of
the
post
of
to
the
parliament
i
know
no
other
post
than
the
one
fouquet
exactly
so
my
dear
you
are
not
over
fastidious
monseigneur
but
before
the
post
can
be
bought
it
must
be
offered
for
i
believe
monsieur
vanel
that
it
will
be
for
sale
before
for
sale
what
fouquet
s
post
of
so
it
is
the
post
which
renders
him
so
perfectly
invincible
for
sale
ha
ha
said
vanel
beginning
to
laugh
would
you
be
afraid
then
of
the
post
said
colbert
gravely
afraid
no
but
are
you
desirous
of
obtaining
it
you
are
laughing
at
me
monseigneur
replied
vanel
is
it
likely
that
a
counselor
of
the
parliament
would
not
be
desirous
of
becoming
well
monsieur
vanel
since
i
tell
you
that
the
post
as
report
goes
will
be
shortly
for
sale
i
can
not
help
repeating
monseigneur
that
it
is
impossible
a
man
never
throws
away
the
buckler
behind
which
he
maintains
his
honor
his
fortune
his
very
there
are
certain
men
mad
enough
vanel
to
fancy
themselves
out
of
the
reach
of
all
yes
monseigneur
but
such
men
never
commit
their
mad
acts
for
the
advantage
of
the
poor
vanels
of
the
why
not
for
the
very
reason
that
those
vanels
are
it
is
true
that
fouquet
s
post
might
cost
a
good
round
sum
what
would
you
bid
for
it
monsieur
vanel
everything
i
am
which
means
three
or
four
hundred
thousand
and
the
post
is
worth
a
million
and
a
half
at
the
very
lowest
i
know
persons
who
have
offered
one
million
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
without
being
able
to
persuade
fouquet
to
sell
besides
supposing
it
were
to
happen
that
fouquet
wished
to
sell
which
i
do
not
believe
in
spite
of
what
i
have
been
told
ah
you
have
heard
something
about
it
then
who
told
you
m
de
gourville
pelisson
and
very
good
if
therefore
fouquet
did
wish
to
sell
i
could
not
buy
it
just
yet
since
the
superintendent
will
only
sell
for
ready
money
and
no
one
has
a
million
and
a
half
to
put
down
at
colbert
suddenly
interrupted
the
counselor
by
an
imperious
gesture
he
had
begun
to
meditate
observing
his
superior
s
serious
attitude
and
his
perseverance
in
continuing
the
conversation
on
this
subject
vanel
awaited
the
solution
without
venturing
to
precipitate
it
explain
to
me
the
privileges
which
this
post
the
right
of
impeaching
every
french
subject
who
is
not
a
prince
of
the
blood
the
right
of
quashing
all
proceedings
taken
against
any
frenchman
who
is
neither
king
nor
prince
the
is
the
king
s
right
hand
to
punish
the
guilty
the
office
is
the
means
whereby
also
he
can
evade
the
administration
of
justice
fouquet
therefore
would
be
able
by
stirring
up
parliament
to
maintain
himself
even
against
the
king
and
the
king
could
as
easily
by
humoring
fouquet
get
his
edicts
registered
in
spite
of
every
opposition
and
objection
the
can
be
made
a
very
useful
or
a
very
dangerous
vanel
would
you
like
to
be
said
colbert
suddenly
softening
both
his
look
and
his
voice
i
exclaimed
the
latter
i
have
already
had
the
honor
to
represent
to
you
that
i
want
about
eleven
hundred
thousand
francs
to
make
up
the
borrow
that
sum
from
your
i
have
no
friends
richer
than
you
are
an
honest
and
honorable
man
ah
monseigneur
if
the
world
would
only
think
as
you
do
i
think
so
and
that
is
quite
enough
and
if
it
should
be
needed
i
will
be
your
do
not
forget
the
proverb
what
is
it
that
he
who
becomes
responsible
for
another
has
to
pay
for
his
let
that
make
no
vanel
rose
bewildered
by
this
offer
which
had
been
so
suddenly
and
unexpectedly
made
to
him
you
are
not
trifling
with
me
monseigneur
he
said
stay
you
say
that
gourville
has
spoken
to
you
about
fouquet
s
post
yes
and
pelisson
officially
so
or
only
through
their
own
suggestion
these
were
their
very
words
the
parliament
members
are
as
proud
as
they
are
wealthy
they
ought
to
club
together
two
or
three
millions
among
themselves
to
present
to
their
protector
and
leader
and
what
did
you
reply
i
said
that
for
my
own
part
i
would
give
ten
thousand
francs
if
ah
you
like
fouquet
then
exclaimed
colbert
with
a
look
of
hatred
no
but
fouquet
is
our
chief
he
is
in
debt
is
on
the
high
road
to
ruin
and
we
ought
to
save
the
honor
of
the
body
of
which
we
are
exactly
and
that
explains
why
fouquet
will
be
always
safe
and
sound
so
long
as
he
occupies
his
present
post
replied
colbert
thereupon
said
vanel
m
gourville
added
if
we
were
to
do
anything
out
of
charity
to
fouquet
it
could
not
be
otherwise
than
most
humiliating
to
him
and
he
would
be
sure
to
refuse
it
let
the
parliament
subscribe
among
themselves
to
purchase
in
a
proper
manner
the
post
of
in
that
case
all
would
go
well
the
honor
of
our
body
would
be
saved
and
fouquet
s
pride
that
is
an
i
considered
it
so
well
monsieur
vanel
you
will
go
at
once
and
find
out
either
gourville
or
pelisson
do
you
know
any
other
friend
of
fouquet
i
know
de
la
fontaine
very
la
fontaine
the
rhymester
yes
he
used
to
write
verses
to
my
wife
when
fouquet
was
one
of
our
go
to
him
then
and
try
and
procure
an
interview
with
the
willingly
but
the
sum
itself
on
the
day
and
hour
you
arrange
to
settle
the
matter
monsieur
vanel
you
shall
be
supplied
with
the
money
so
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
on
monseigneur
such
munificence
you
eclipse
kings
even
you
surpass
fouquet
stay
a
moment
do
not
let
us
mistake
each
other
i
do
not
make
you
a
present
of
fourteen
hundred
thousand
francs
monsieur
vanel
for
i
have
children
to
provide
for
but
i
will
you
that
ask
whatever
interest
whatever
security
you
please
monseigneur
i
am
quite
ready
and
when
all
your
requisitions
are
satisfied
i
will
still
repeat
that
you
surpass
kings
and
fouquet
in
munificence
what
conditions
do
you
impose
the
repayment
in
eight
years
and
a
mortgage
upon
the
appointment
certainly
is
that
all
wait
a
moment
i
reserve
to
myself
the
right
of
purchasing
the
post
from
you
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
profit
for
yourself
if
in
your
mode
of
filling
the
office
you
do
not
follow
out
a
line
of
conduct
in
conformity
with
the
interests
of
the
king
and
with
my
said
vanel
in
an
altered
tone
is
there
anything
in
that
which
can
possibly
be
objectionable
to
you
monsieur
vanel
said
colbert
coldly
oh
no
no
replied
vanel
nervously
very
good
we
will
sign
an
agreement
to
that
effect
whenever
you
like
and
now
go
as
quickly
as
you
can
to
fouquet
s
friend
obtain
an
interview
with
the
superintendent
do
not
be
too
difficult
in
making
whatever
concessions
may
be
required
of
you
and
when
once
the
arrangements
are
all
made
i
will
press
him
to
be
most
careful
to
do
nothing
of
the
kind
do
not
speak
of
signatures
with
fouquet
nor
of
deeds
nor
even
ask
him
to
pass
his
word
understand
this
otherwise
you
will
lose
everything
all
you
have
to
do
is
to
get
fouquet
to
give
you
his
hand
on
the
matter
go
chapter
xliii
an
interview
with
the
the
was
in
the
bedroom
at
the
palais
royal
with
madame
de
motteville
and
senora
molina
king
louis
who
had
been
impatiently
expected
the
whole
day
had
not
made
his
appearance
and
the
queen
who
was
growing
impatient
had
often
sent
to
inquire
about
him
the
moral
atmosphere
of
the
court
seemed
to
indicate
an
approaching
storm
the
courtiers
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
avoided
meeting
in
the
and
the
corridors
in
order
not
to
converse
on
compromising
subjects
monsieur
had
joined
the
king
early
in
the
morning
for
a
madame
remained
in
her
own
apartment
cool
and
distant
to
every
one
and
the
after
she
had
said
her
prayers
in
latin
talked
of
domestic
matters
with
her
two
friends
in
pure
castilian
madame
de
motteville
who
understood
the
language
perfectly
answered
her
in
french
when
the
three
ladies
had
exhausted
every
form
of
dissimulation
and
of
politeness
as
a
circuitous
mode
of
expressing
that
the
king
s
conduct
was
making
the
queen
and
the
pine
away
through
sheer
grief
and
vexation
and
when
in
the
most
guarded
and
polished
phrases
they
had
fulminated
every
variety
of
imprecation
against
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
the
terminated
her
attack
by
an
exclamation
indicative
of
her
own
reflections
and
character
hijos
said
she
to
molina
which
means
these
children
words
full
of
meaning
on
a
mother
s
lips
words
full
of
terrible
significance
in
the
mouth
of
a
queen
who
like
anne
of
austria
hid
many
curious
secrets
in
her
soul
yes
said
molina
children
children
for
whom
every
mother
becomes
a
yes
replied
the
queen
a
mother
sacrifices
everything
she
did
not
finish
her
phrase
for
she
fancied
when
she
raised
her
eyes
towards
the
portrait
of
the
pale
louis
that
light
once
more
flashed
from
her
husband
s
dull
eyes
and
his
nostrils
grew
livid
with
wrath
the
portrait
seemed
animated
by
a
living
expression
speak
it
did
not
but
it
seemed
to
threaten
a
profound
silence
succeeded
the
queen
s
last
remark
la
molina
began
to
turn
over
ribbons
and
laces
on
a
large
madame
de
motteville
surprised
at
the
look
of
mutual
intelligence
which
had
been
exchanged
between
the
confidant
and
her
mistress
cast
down
her
eyes
like
a
discreet
woman
and
pretending
to
be
observant
of
nothing
that
was
passing
listened
with
the
utmost
attention
to
every
word
she
heard
nothing
however
but
a
very
insignificant
hum
on
the
part
of
the
spanish
duenna
who
was
the
incarnation
of
caution
and
a
profound
sigh
on
that
of
the
queen
she
looked
up
immediately
you
are
suffering
she
said
no
motteville
no
why
do
you
say
that
your
majesty
almost
groaned
just
you
are
right
i
did
sigh
in
monsieur
valot
is
not
far
off
i
believe
he
is
in
madame
s
why
is
he
with
madame
madame
is
troubled
with
nervous
a
very
fine
disorder
indeed
there
is
little
good
in
valot
being
there
when
a
very
different
physician
would
quickly
cure
madame
de
motteville
looked
up
with
an
air
of
great
surprise
as
she
replied
another
doctor
instead
of
m
valot
whom
do
you
mean
occupation
motteville
occupation
if
any
one
is
really
ill
it
is
my
poor
and
your
majesty
less
so
this
evening
do
not
believe
that
too
confidently
madame
said
de
motteville
and
as
if
to
justify
her
caution
a
sharp
acute
pain
seized
the
queen
who
turned
deadly
pale
and
threw
herself
back
in
the
chair
with
every
symptom
of
a
sudden
fainting
fit
molina
ran
to
a
richly
gilded
cabinet
from
which
she
took
a
large
bottle
of
scented
salts
and
held
it
to
the
queen
s
nostrils
who
inhaled
it
wildly
for
a
few
minutes
and
murmured
it
is
hastening
my
death
but
heaven
s
will
be
done
your
majesty
s
death
is
not
so
near
at
hand
added
molina
replacing
the
in
the
cabinet
does
your
majesty
feel
better
now
inquired
madame
de
motteville
much
better
returned
the
queen
placing
her
finger
on
her
lips
to
impose
silence
on
her
favorite
it
is
very
strange
remarked
madame
de
motteville
after
a
pause
what
is
strange
said
the
queen
does
your
majesty
remember
the
day
when
this
pain
attacked
you
for
the
first
time
i
remember
only
that
it
was
a
grievously
sad
day
for
me
but
your
majesty
did
not
always
regard
that
day
as
a
sad
why
because
three
and
twenty
years
ago
on
that
very
day
his
present
majesty
your
own
glorious
son
was
born
at
the
very
same
the
queen
uttered
a
loud
cry
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
seemed
utterly
prostrated
for
some
minutes
but
whether
from
recollections
which
arose
in
her
mind
or
from
reflection
or
even
with
sheer
pain
was
doubtful
la
molina
darted
a
look
at
madame
de
motteville
so
full
of
bitter
reproach
that
the
poor
woman
perfectly
ignorant
of
its
meaning
was
in
her
own
exculpation
on
the
point
of
asking
an
explanation
when
suddenly
anne
of
austria
arose
and
said
yes
the
of
september
my
sorrow
began
on
the
of
september
the
greatest
joy
one
day
the
deepest
sorrow
the
next
the
sorrow
she
added
the
bitter
expiation
of
a
too
excessive
and
from
that
moment
anne
of
austria
whose
memory
and
reason
seemed
to
be
suspended
for
the
time
remained
impenetrable
with
vacant
look
mind
almost
wandering
and
hands
hanging
heavily
down
as
if
life
had
almost
departed
we
must
put
her
to
bed
said
la
molina
presently
let
us
leave
the
queen
alone
added
the
spanish
attendant
madame
de
motteville
rose
large
tears
were
rolling
down
the
queen
s
pallid
face
and
molina
having
observed
this
sign
of
weakness
fixed
her
black
vigilant
eyes
upon
her
yes
yes
replied
the
queen
leave
us
motteville
the
word
us
produced
a
disagreeable
effect
upon
the
ears
of
the
french
favorite
for
it
signified
that
an
interchange
of
secrets
or
of
revelations
of
the
past
was
about
to
be
made
and
that
one
person
was
in
the
conversation
which
seemed
likely
to
take
place
will
molina
alone
be
sufficient
for
your
majesty
inquired
the
french
woman
yes
replied
the
queen
madame
de
motteville
bowed
in
submission
and
was
about
to
withdraw
when
suddenly
an
old
female
attendant
dressed
as
if
she
had
belonged
to
the
spanish
court
of
the
year
opened
the
door
and
surprised
the
queen
in
her
tears
the
remedy
she
cried
delightedly
to
the
queen
as
she
unceremoniously
approached
the
group
what
remedy
said
anne
of
austria
for
your
majesty
s
sufferings
the
former
replied
who
brings
it
asked
madame
de
motteville
eagerly
monsieur
valot
no
a
lady
from
from
flanders
is
she
spanish
inquired
the
queen
i
don
t
who
sent
her
m
her
name
she
did
not
mention
her
position
in
life
she
will
answer
that
who
is
she
she
is
go
molina
go
and
see
cried
the
queen
it
is
needless
suddenly
replied
a
voice
at
once
firm
and
gentle
in
its
tone
which
proceeded
from
the
other
side
of
the
tapestry
hangings
a
voice
which
made
the
attendants
start
and
the
queen
tremble
excessively
at
the
same
moment
a
masked
female
appeared
through
the
hangings
and
before
the
queen
could
speak
a
syllable
she
added
i
am
connected
with
the
order
of
the
beguines
of
bruges
and
do
indeed
bring
with
me
the
remedy
which
is
certain
to
effect
a
cure
of
your
majesty
s
no
one
uttered
a
sound
and
the
beguine
did
not
move
a
step
speak
said
the
queen
i
will
when
we
are
alone
was
the
answer
anne
of
austria
looked
at
her
attendants
who
immediately
withdrew
the
beguine
thereupon
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
the
queen
and
bowed
reverently
before
her
the
queen
gazed
with
increasing
mistrust
at
this
woman
who
in
her
turn
fixed
a
pair
of
brilliant
eyes
upon
her
through
her
mask
the
queen
of
france
must
indeed
be
very
ill
said
anne
of
austria
if
it
is
known
at
the
beguinage
of
bruges
that
she
stands
in
need
of
being
your
majesty
is
not
irremediably
but
tell
me
how
you
happen
to
know
i
am
suffering
your
majesty
has
friends
in
since
these
friends
then
sent
you
mention
their
impossible
madame
since
your
majesty
s
memory
has
not
been
awakened
by
your
anne
of
austria
looked
up
endeavoring
to
discover
through
the
mysterious
mask
and
this
ambiguous
language
the
name
of
her
companion
who
expressed
herself
with
such
familiarity
and
freedom
then
suddenly
wearied
by
a
curiosity
which
wounded
every
feeling
of
pride
in
her
nature
she
said
you
are
ignorant
perhaps
that
royal
personages
are
never
spoken
to
with
the
face
deign
to
excuse
me
madame
replied
the
beguine
humbly
i
can
not
excuse
you
i
may
possibly
forgive
you
if
you
throw
your
mask
i
have
made
a
vow
madame
to
attend
and
aid
all
afflicted
and
suffering
persons
without
ever
permitting
them
to
behold
my
face
i
might
have
been
able
to
administer
some
relief
to
your
body
and
to
your
mind
too
but
since
your
majesty
forbids
me
i
will
take
my
leave
adieu
madame
adieu
these
words
were
uttered
with
a
harmony
of
tone
and
respect
of
manner
that
disarmed
the
queen
of
all
anger
and
suspicion
but
did
not
remove
her
feeling
of
curiosity
you
are
right
she
said
it
those
who
are
suffering
to
reject
the
means
of
relief
heaven
sends
them
speak
then
and
may
you
indeed
be
able
as
you
assert
to
administer
relief
to
my
body
let
us
first
speak
a
little
of
the
mind
if
you
please
said
the
beguine
of
the
mind
which
i
am
sure
must
also
my
mind
there
are
cancers
so
insidious
in
their
nature
that
their
very
pulsations
can
not
be
felt
such
cancers
madame
leave
the
ivory
whiteness
of
the
skin
unblemished
and
putrefy
not
the
firm
fair
flesh
with
their
blue
tints
the
physician
who
bends
over
the
patient
s
chest
hears
not
though
he
listens
the
insatiable
teeth
of
the
disease
grinding
onward
through
the
muscles
and
the
blood
flows
freely
on
the
knife
has
never
been
able
to
destroy
and
rarely
even
temporarily
to
disarm
the
rage
of
these
mortal
scourges
their
home
is
in
the
mind
which
they
corrupt
they
gnaw
the
whole
heart
until
it
breaks
such
madame
are
the
cancers
fatal
to
queens
are
you
too
free
from
their
scourge
anne
slowly
raised
her
arm
dazzling
in
its
perfect
whiteness
and
pure
in
its
rounded
outlines
as
it
was
in
the
time
of
her
earlier
days
the
evils
to
which
you
allude
she
said
are
the
condition
of
the
lives
of
the
high
in
rank
upon
earth
to
whom
heaven
has
imparted
mind
when
those
evils
become
too
heavy
to
be
borne
heaven
lightens
their
burdens
by
penitence
and
confession
thus
only
we
lay
down
our
burden
and
the
secrets
that
oppress
us
but
forget
not
that
the
same
gracious
heaven
in
its
mercy
apportions
to
their
trials
the
strength
of
the
feeble
creatures
of
its
hand
and
my
strength
has
enabled
me
to
bear
my
burden
for
the
secrets
of
others
the
silence
of
heaven
is
more
than
sufficient
for
my
own
secrets
that
of
my
confessor
is
you
are
as
courageous
madame
i
see
as
ever
against
your
enemies
you
do
not
acknowledge
your
confidence
in
your
friends
queens
have
no
friends
if
you
have
nothing
further
to
say
to
me
if
you
feel
yourself
inspired
by
heaven
as
a
prophetess
leave
me
i
pray
for
i
dread
the
i
should
have
supposed
said
the
beguine
resolutely
that
you
would
rather
have
dreaded
the
hardly
had
these
words
escaped
her
lips
than
the
queen
rose
up
proudly
speak
she
cried
in
a
short
imperious
tone
of
voice
explain
yourself
briefly
quickly
entirely
or
if
not
nay
do
not
threaten
me
your
majesty
said
the
beguine
gently
i
came
here
to
you
full
of
compassion
and
respect
i
came
here
on
the
part
of
a
prove
that
to
me
comfort
instead
of
irritating
easily
enough
and
your
majesty
will
see
who
is
friendly
to
you
what
misfortune
has
happened
to
your
majesty
during
these
three
and
twenty
years
past
serious
misfortunes
indeed
have
i
not
lost
the
king
i
speak
not
of
misfortunes
of
kind
i
wish
to
ask
you
if
since
the
birth
of
the
king
any
indiscretion
on
a
friend
s
part
has
caused
your
majesty
the
slightest
serious
anxiety
or
distress
i
do
not
understand
you
replied
the
queen
clenching
her
teeth
in
order
to
conceal
her
emotion
i
will
make
myself
understood
then
your
majesty
remembers
that
the
king
was
born
on
the
of
september
at
a
quarter
past
eleven
o
yes
stammered
out
the
queen
at
twelve
continued
the
beguine
the
dauphin
who
had
been
baptized
by
monseigneur
de
meaux
in
the
king
s
and
your
own
presence
was
acknowledged
as
the
heir
of
the
crown
of
france
the
king
then
went
to
the
chapel
of
the
old
chateau
de
to
hear
the
quite
true
quite
true
murmured
the
queen
your
majesty
s
conferment
took
place
in
the
presence
of
monsieur
his
majesty
s
late
uncle
of
the
princes
and
of
the
ladies
attached
to
the
court
the
king
s
physician
bouvard
and
honore
the
surgeon
were
stationed
in
the
your
majesty
slept
from
three
o
clock
until
seven
i
yes
yes
but
you
tell
me
no
more
than
every
one
else
knows
as
well
as
you
and
i
am
now
madame
approaching
that
which
very
few
persons
are
acquainted
with
very
few
persons
did
i
say
alas
i
might
say
two
only
for
formerly
there
were
but
five
in
all
and
for
many
years
past
the
secret
has
been
well
preserved
by
the
deaths
of
the
principal
participators
in
it
the
late
king
sleeps
now
with
his
ancestors
perronnette
the
midwife
soon
followed
him
laporte
is
already
the
queen
opened
her
lips
as
though
to
reply
she
felt
beneath
her
icy
hand
with
which
she
kept
her
face
half
concealed
the
beads
of
perspiration
on
her
brow
it
was
eight
o
clock
pursued
the
beguine
the
king
was
seated
at
supper
full
of
joy
and
happiness
around
him
on
all
sides
arose
wild
cries
of
delight
and
drinking
of
healths
the
people
cheered
beneath
the
balconies
the
swiss
guards
the
musketeers
and
the
royal
guards
wandered
through
the
city
borne
about
in
triumph
by
the
drunken
students
those
boisterous
sounds
of
general
joy
disturbed
the
dauphin
the
future
king
of
france
who
was
quietly
lying
in
the
arms
of
madame
de
hausac
his
nurse
and
whose
eyes
as
he
opened
them
and
stared
about
might
have
observed
two
crowns
at
the
foot
of
his
cradle
suddenly
your
majesty
uttered
a
piercing
cry
and
dame
perronnette
immediately
flew
to
your
bedside
the
doctors
were
dining
in
a
room
at
some
distance
from
your
chamber
the
palace
deserted
from
the
frequency
of
the
irruptions
made
into
it
was
without
either
sentinels
or
guards
the
midwife
having
questioned
and
examined
your
majesty
gave
a
sudden
exclamation
as
if
in
wild
astonishment
and
taking
you
in
her
arms
bewildered
almost
out
of
her
senses
from
sheer
distress
of
mind
dispatched
laporte
to
inform
the
king
that
her
majesty
the
wished
to
see
him
in
her
room
laporte
you
are
aware
madame
was
a
man
of
the
most
admirable
calmness
and
presence
of
mind
he
did
not
approach
the
king
as
if
he
were
the
bearer
of
alarming
intelligence
and
wished
to
inspire
the
terror
he
himself
experienced
besides
it
was
not
a
very
terrifying
intelligence
which
awaited
the
king
therefore
laporte
appeared
with
a
smile
upon
his
lips
and
approached
the
king
s
chair
saying
to
him
sire
the
queen
is
very
happy
and
would
be
still
more
so
to
see
your
on
that
day
louis
xiii
would
have
given
his
crown
away
to
the
veriest
beggar
for
a
god
bless
animated
and
full
of
gayety
the
king
rose
from
the
table
and
said
to
those
around
him
in
a
tone
that
henry
iv
might
have
adopted
gentlemen
i
am
going
to
see
my
he
came
to
your
beside
madame
at
the
very
moment
dame
perronnette
presented
to
him
a
second
prince
as
beautiful
and
healthy
as
the
former
and
said
sire
heaven
will
not
allow
the
kingdom
of
france
to
fall
into
the
female
the
king
yielding
to
a
first
impulse
clasped
the
child
in
his
arms
and
cried
oh
heaven
i
thank
thee
at
this
part
of
her
recital
the
beguine
paused
observing
how
intensely
the
queen
was
suffering
she
had
thrown
herself
back
in
her
chair
and
with
her
head
bent
forward
and
her
eyes
fixed
listened
without
seeming
to
hear
and
her
lips
moving
convulsively
either
breathing
a
prayer
to
heaven
or
imprecations
on
the
woman
standing
before
her
ah
i
do
not
believe
that
if
because
there
could
be
but
one
dauphin
in
france
exclaimed
the
beguine
the
queen
allowed
that
child
to
vegetate
banished
from
his
royal
parents
presence
she
was
on
that
account
an
unfeeling
mother
oh
no
no
there
are
those
alive
who
have
known
and
witnessed
the
passionate
kisses
she
imprinted
on
that
innocent
creature
in
exchange
for
a
life
of
misery
and
gloom
to
which
state
policy
condemned
the
twin
brother
of
louis
oh
heaven
murmured
the
queen
feebly
it
is
admitted
continued
the
beguine
quickly
that
when
the
king
perceived
the
effect
which
would
result
from
the
existence
of
two
sons
equal
in
age
and
pretensions
he
trembled
for
the
welfare
of
france
for
the
tranquillity
of
the
state
and
it
is
equally
well
known
that
cardinal
de
richelieu
by
the
direction
of
louis
thought
over
the
subject
with
deep
attention
and
after
an
hour
s
meditation
in
his
majesty
s
cabinet
he
pronounced
the
following
sentence
one
prince
means
peace
and
safety
for
the
state
two
competitors

war
and
the
queen
rose
suddenly
from
her
seat
pale
as
death
and
her
hands
clenched
together
you
know
too
much
she
said
in
a
hoarse
thick
voice
since
you
refer
to
secrets
of
state
as
for
the
friends
from
whom
you
have
acquired
this
secret
they
are
false
and
treacherous
you
are
their
accomplice
in
the
crime
which
is
being
now
committed
now
throw
aside
your
mask
or
i
will
have
you
arrested
by
my
captain
of
the
guards
do
not
think
that
this
secret
terrifies
me
you
have
obtained
it
you
shall
restore
it
to
me
never
shall
it
leave
your
bosom
for
neither
your
secret
nor
your
own
life

to
you

the

a
couple
of
steps
towards
the
beguine

said
the
latter
to
know
and
value
the
fidelity
the
honor
and
secrecy
of
the
friends
you
have
and
then
suddenly
she
threw
aside
her
mask
madame
de

exclaimed
the
queen
with
your
majesty
the
sole
living
of
the

murmured
anne

come
and
embrace

alas
you
kill
your
friend
in
thus
trifling
with
her
terrible
and
the
queen
leaning
her
head
upon
the
shoulder
of
the
old
duchesse
burst
into
a
flood
of
bitter
tears
how
young
you
are
still
said
the
latter
in
a
hollow
voice
you
can
weep
chapter
xliv
two
friends
the
queen
looked
steadily
at
madame
de
chevreuse
and
said
i
believe
you
just
now
made
use
of
the
word
happy
in
speaking
of
me
hitherto
duchesse
i
had
thought
it
impossible
that
a
human
creature
could
anywhere
be
found
more
miserable
than
the
queen
of
your
afflictions
madame
have
indeed
been
terrible
enough
but
by
the
side
of
those
great
and
grand
misfortunes
to
which
we
two
old
friends
separated
by
men
s
malice
were
just
now
alluding
you
possess
sources
of
pleasure
slight
enough
in
themselves
it
may
be
but
greatly
envied
by
the
what
are
they
said
anne
of
austria
bitterly
what
can
induce
you
to
pronounce
the
word
pleasure
duchesse
you
who
just
now
admitted
that
my
body
and
my
mind
both
stood
in
need
of
remedies
madame
de
chevreuse
collected
herself
for
a
moment
and
then
murmured
how
far
removed
kings
are
from
other
people
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
they
are
so
far
removed
from
the
vulgar
herd
that
they
forget
that
others
often
stand
in
need
of
the
bare
necessities
of
life
they
are
like
the
inhabitant
of
the
african
mountains
who
gazing
from
the
verdant
tableland
refreshed
by
the
rills
of
melted
snow
can
not
comprehend
that
the
dwellers
in
the
plains
below
are
perishing
from
hunger
and
thirst
in
the
midst
of
the
desert
burnt
up
by
the
heat
of
the
the
queen
colored
for
she
now
began
to
perceive
the
drift
of
her
friend
s
remark
it
was
very
wrong
she
said
to
have
neglected
oh
madame
i
know
the
king
has
inherited
the
hatred
his
father
bore
me
the
king
would
exile
me
if
he
knew
i
were
in
the
palais
i
can
not
say
that
the
king
is
very
well
disposed
towards
you
duchesse
replied
the
queen
but
i
could
secretly
you
know
the
duchesse
s
disdainful
smile
produced
a
feeling
of
uneasiness
in
the
queen
s
mind
duchesse
she
hastened
to
add
you
did
perfectly
right
to
come
here
even
were
it
only
to
give
us
the
happiness
of
contradicting
the
report
of
your
has
it
been
rumored
then
that
i
was
dead
and
yet
my
children
did
not
go
into
ah
you
know
duchesse
the
court
is
very
frequently
moving
about
from
place
to
place
we
see
albert
de
luynes
but
seldom
and
many
things
escape
our
minds
in
the
midst
of
the
preoccupations
that
constantly
beset
your
majesty
ought
not
to
have
believed
the
report
of
my
why
not
alas
we
are
all
mortal
and
you
may
perceive
how
rapidly
i
your
younger
sister
as
we
used
formerly
to
say
am
approaching
the
if
your
majesty
believed
me
dead
you
ought
in
that
case
to
have
been
astonished
not
to
have
received
the
death
not
unfrequently
takes
us
by
surprise
oh
your
majesty
those
who
are
burdened
with
secrets
such
as
we
have
just
now
discussed
must
as
a
necessity
of
their
nature
satisfy
their
craving
desire
to
divulge
them
and
they
feel
they
must
gratify
that
desire
before
they
die
among
the
various
preparations
for
their
final
journey
the
task
of
placing
their
papers
in
order
is
not
the
queen
started
your
majesty
will
be
sure
to
learn
in
a
particular
manner
the
day
of
my
in
what
way
because
your
majesty
will
receive
the
next
day
under
several
coverings
everything
connected
with
our
mysterious
correspondence
of
former
did
you
not
burn
them
cried
anne
in
alarm
traitors
only
replied
the
duchesse
destroy
a
royal
traitors
do
you
say
yes
certainly
or
rather
they
pretend
to
destroy
instead
of
which
they
keep
or
sell
it
faithful
friends
on
the
contrary
most
carefully
secrete
such
treasures
for
it
may
happen
that
some
day
or
other
they
would
wish
to
seek
out
their
queen
in
order
to
say
to
her
madame
i
am
getting
old
my
health
is
fast
failing
me
in
the
presence
of
the
danger
of
death
for
there
is
the
risk
for
your
majesty
that
this
secret
may
be
revealed
take
therefore
this
paper
so
fraught
with
menace
for
yourself
and
trust
not
to
another
to
burn
it
for
what
paper
do
you
refer
to
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
have
but
one
it
is
true
but
that
is
indeed
most
dangerous
in
its
oh
duchesse
tell
me
what
it
a
letter
dated
tuesday
the
of
august
in
which
you
beg
me
to
go
to
to
see
that
unhappy
child
in
your
own
handwriting
madame
there
are
those
words
that
unhappy
child
a
profound
silence
ensued
the
queen
s
mind
was
busy
in
the
past
madame
de
chevreuse
was
watching
the
progress
of
her
scheme
yes
unhappy
most
unhappy
murmured
anne
of
austria
how
sad
the
existence
he
led
poor
child
to
finish
it
in
so
cruel
a
is
he
dead
cried
the
duchesse
suddenly
with
a
curiosity
whose
genuine
accents
the
queen
instinctively
detected
he
died
of
consumption
died
forgotten
died
withered
and
blighted
like
the
flowers
a
lover
has
given
to
his
mistress
which
she
leaves
to
die
secreted
in
a
drawer
where
she
had
hid
them
from
the
gaze
of
died
repeated
the
duchesse
with
an
air
of
discouragement
which
would
have
afforded
the
queen
the
most
unfeigned
delight
had
it
not
been
tempered
in
some
measure
with
a
mixture
of
doubt
died
at
yes
in
the
arms
of
his
tutor
a
poor
honest
man
who
did
not
long
survive
that
can
easily
be
understood
it
is
so
difficult
to
bear
up
under
the
weight
of
such
a
loss
and
such
a
secret
said
madame
de
chevreuse
the
irony
of
which
reflection
the
queen
pretended
not
to
perceive
madame
de
chevreuse
continued
well
madame
i
inquired
some
years
ago
at
about
this
unhappy
child
i
was
told
that
it
was
not
believed
he
was
dead
and
that
was
my
reason
for
not
having
at
first
condoled
with
your
majesty
for
most
certainly
if
i
could
have
thought
it
were
true
never
should
i
have
made
the
slightest
allusion
to
so
deplorable
an
event
and
thus
have
your
majesty
s
most
natural
you
say
that
it
is
not
believed
the
child
died
at
noisy
no
what
did
they
say
about
him
then
they
said
but
no
doubt
they
were
mistaken
nay
speak
speak
they
said
that
one
evening
about
the
year
a
lady
beautiful
and
majestic
in
her
bearing
which
was
observed
notwithstanding
the
mask
and
the
mantle
that
concealed
her
figure
a
lady
of
rank
of
very
high
rank
no
doubt
came
in
a
carriage
to
the
place
where
the
road
branches
off
the
very
same
spot
you
know
where
i
awaited
news
of
the
young
prince
when
your
majesty
was
graciously
pleased
to
send
me
well
well
that
the
boy
s
tutor
or
guardian
took
the
child
to
this
well
what
next
that
both
the
child
and
his
tutor
left
that
part
of
the
country
the
very
next
there
you
see
there
is
some
truth
in
what
you
relate
since
in
point
of
fact
the
poor
child
died
from
a
sudden
attack
of
illness
which
makes
the
lives
of
all
children
as
doctors
say
suspended
as
it
were
by
a
what
your
majesty
says
is
quite
true
no
one
knows
it
better
than
yourself
no
one
believes
it
more
strongly
than
myself
but
yet
how
strange
it
is
what
can
it
now
be
thought
the
queen
the
person
who
gave
me
these
details
who
was
sent
to
inquire
after
the
child
s
health
did
you
confide
such
a
charge
to
any
one
else
oh
duchesse
some
one
as
dumb
as
your
majesty
as
dumb
as
myself
we
will
suppose
it
was
myself
madame
this
some
one
some
months
after
passing
through
touraine
touraine
recognized
both
the
tutor
and
the
child
too
i
am
wrong
thought
he
recognized
them
both
living
cheerful
happy
and
flourishing
the
one
in
a
green
old
age
the
other
in
the
flower
of
his
youth
judge
after
that
what
truth
can
be
attributed
to
the
rumors
which
are
circulated
or
what
faith
after
that
placed
in
anything
that
may
happen
in
the
world
but
i
am
fatiguing
your
majesty
it
was
not
my
intention
however
to
do
so
and
i
will
take
my
leave
of
you
after
renewing
to
you
the
assurance
of
my
most
respectful
stay
duchesse
let
us
first
talk
a
little
about
of
myself
madame
i
am
not
worthy
that
you
should
bend
your
looks
upon
why
not
indeed
are
you
not
the
oldest
friend
i
have
are
you
angry
with
me
duchesse
i
indeed
what
motive
could
i
have
if
i
had
reason
to
be
angry
with
your
majesty
should
i
have
come
here
duchesse
age
is
fast
creeping
on
us
both
we
should
be
united
against
that
death
whose
approach
can
not
be
far
you
overpower
me
madame
with
the
kindness
of
your
no
one
has
ever
loved
or
served
me
as
you
have
done
your
majesty
is
too
kind
in
remembering
not
so
give
me
a
proof
of
your
friendship
my
whole
being
is
devoted
to
you
the
proof
i
require
is
that
you
should
ask
something
of
ask
oh
i
know
you
well
no
one
is
more
disinterested
more
noble
and
truly
do
not
praise
me
too
highly
madame
said
the
duchesse
somewhat
anxiously
i
could
never
praise
you
as
much
as
you
deserve
to
be
and
yet
age
and
misfortune
effect
a
terrible
change
in
people
so
much
the
better
for
the
beautiful
the
haughty
the
adored
duchesse
of
former
days
might
have
answered
me
ungratefully
i
do
not
wish
for
anything
from
heaven
be
praised
the
misfortunes
you
speak
of
have
indeed
worked
a
change
in
you
for
you
will
now
perhaps
answer
me
i
the
duchesse
s
look
and
smile
soon
changed
at
this
conclusion
and
she
no
longer
attempted
to
act
a
false
part
speak
dearest
what
do
you
want
i
must
first
explain
to
you
do
so
well
then
your
majesty
can
confer
the
greatest
the
most
ineffable
pleasure
upon
what
is
it
said
the
queen
a
little
distant
in
her
manner
from
an
uneasiness
of
feeling
produced
by
this
remark
but
do
not
forget
my
good
chevreuse
that
i
am
quite
as
much
under
my
son
s
influence
as
i
was
formerly
under
my
husband
i
will
not
be
too
hard
call
me
as
you
used
to
do
it
will
be
a
sweet
echo
of
our
happy
well
then
my
dear
mistress
my
darling
anne
do
you
know
spanish
still
ask
me
in
spanish
will
your
majesty
do
me
the
honor
to
pass
a
few
days
with
me
at
dampierre
is
that
all
said
the
queen
stupefied
nothing
more
than
that
good
heavens
can
you
possibly
imagine
that
in
asking
you
that
i
am
not
asking
you
the
greatest
conceivable
favor
if
that
really
be
the
case
you
do
not
know
me
will
you
accept
yes
gladly
and
i
shall
be
happy
continued
the
queen
with
some
suspicion
if
my
presence
can
in
any
way
be
useful
to
useful
exclaimed
the
duchesse
laughing
oh
no
no
agreeable
delightful
if
you
like
and
you
promise
me
then
i
swear
it
said
the
queen
whereupon
the
duchesse
seized
her
beautiful
hand
and
covered
it
with
kisses
the
queen
could
not
help
murmuring
to
herself
she
is
a
woman
and
very
generous
will
your
majesty
consent
to
wait
a
fortnight
before
you
come
certainly
but
why
because
said
the
duchesse
knowing
me
to
be
in
disgrace
no
one
would
lend
me
the
hundred
thousand
francs
which
i
require
to
put
dampierre
into
a
state
of
repair
but
when
it
is
known
that
i
require
that
sum
for
the
purpose
of
receiving
your
majesty
at
dampierre
properly
all
the
money
in
paris
will
be
at
my
ah
said
the
queen
gently
nodding
her
head
in
sign
of
intelligence
a
hundred
thousand
francs
you
want
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
put
dampierre
into
repair
quite
as
much
as
and
no
one
will
lend
you
them
no
i
will
lend
them
to
you
if
you
like
oh
i
hardly
dare
accept
such
a
you
would
be
wrong
if
you
did
besides
a
hundred
thousand
francs
is
really
not
much
i
know
but
too
well
that
you
never
set
a
right
value
upon
your
silence
and
secrecy
push
that
table
a
little
towards
me
duchesse
and
i
will
write
you
an
order
on
colbert
no
on
fouquet
who
is
a
far
more
courteous
and
obliging
will
he
pay
it
though
if
he
will
not
pay
it
i
will
but
it
will
be
the
first
time
he
will
have
refused
the
queen
wrote
and
handed
the
duchesse
the
order
and
afterwards
dismissed
her

a
warm
embrace

how
jean
de
la
fontaine
came
to
write
his
first
tale
all
these
intrigues
are
exhausted
the
human
mind
so
variously
complicated
has
been
enabled
to
develop
itself
at
its
ease
in
the
three
outlines
with
which
our
recital
has
supplied
it
it
is
not
unlikely
that
in
the
future
we
are
now
preparing
a
question
of
politics
and
intrigues
may
still
arise
but
the
springs
by
which
they
work
will
be
so
carefully
concealed
that
no
one
will
be
able
to
see
aught
but
flowers
and
paintings
just
as
at
a
theater
where
a
colossus
appears
upon
the
scene
walking
along
moved
by
the
small
legs
and
slender
arms
of
a
child
concealed
within
the
framework
we
now
return
to
where
the
superintendent
was
in
the
habit
of
receiving
his
select
confederacy
of
epicureans
for
some
time
past
the
host
had
met
with
nothing
but
trouble
every
one
in
the
house
was
aware
of
and
felt
for
the
minister
s
distress
no
more
magnificent
or
recklessly
improvident
money
had
been
the
pretext
assigned
by
fouquet
and
never
any
pretext
as
gourville
said
more
fallacious
for
there
was
not
even
a
shadow
of
money
to
be
seen
vatel
was
resolutely
painstaking
in
keeping
up
the
reputation
of
the
house
and
yet
the
gardeners
who
supplied
the
kitchens
complained
of
ruinous
delays
the
agents
for
the
supply
of
spanish
wines
sent
drafts
which
no
one
honored
fishermen
whom
the
superintendent
engaged
on
the
coast
of
normandy
calculated
that
if
they
were
paid
all
that
was
due
to
them
the
amount
would
enable
them
to
retire
comfortably
for
life
fish
which
at
a
later
period
was
the
cause
of
vatel
s
death
did
not
arrive
at
all
however
on
the
ordinary
reception
days
fouquet
s
friends
flocked
in
more
numerously
than
ever
gourville
and
the
abbe
fouquet
talked
over
money
matters
that
is
to
say
the
abbe
borrowed
a
few
pistoles
from
gourville
pelisson
seated
with
his
legs
crossed
was
engaged
in
finishing
the
peroration
of
a
speech
with
which
fouquet
was
to
open
the
parliament
and
this
speech
was
a
masterpiece
because
pelisson
wrote
it
for
his
friend
that
is
to
say
he
inserted
all
kinds
of
clever
things
the
latter
would
most
certainly
never
have
taken
the
trouble
to
say
of
his
own
accord
presently
loret
and
la
fontaine
would
enter
from
the
garden
engaged
in
a
dispute
about
the
art
of
making
verses
the
painters
and
musicians
in
their
turn
were
hovering
near
the
as
soon
as
eight
o
clock
struck
the
supper
would
be
announced
for
the
superintendent
never
kept
any
one
waiting
it
was
already
seven
and
the
appetites
of
the
guests
were
beginning
to
declare
themselves
in
an
emphatic
manner
as
soon
as
all
the
guests
were
assembled
gourville
went
straight
up
to
pelisson
awoke
him
out
of
his
reverie
and
led
him
into
the
middle
of
a
room
and
closed
the
doors
well
he
said
anything
new
pelisson
raised
his
intelligent
and
gentle
face
and
said
i
have
borrowed
five
and
twenty
thousand
francs
of
my
aunt
and
i
have
them
here
in
good
sterling
good
replied
gourville
we
only
what
one
hundred
and
thousand
livres
for
the
first
the
payment
of
what
asked
la
fontaine
what
as
usual
why
it
was
you
who
told
us
the
small
estate
at
corbeli
was
going
to
be
sold
by
one
of
fouquet
s
creditors
and
you
also
who
proposed
that
all
his
friends
should
subscribe
more
than
that
it
was
you
who
said
that
you
would
sell
a
corner
of
your
house
at
in
order
to
furnish
your
own
proportion
and
you
come
and
ask
payment
of
what
this
remark
was
received
with
a
general
laugh
which
made
la
fontaine
blush
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
had
not
forgotten
it
oh
no
only
only
you
remembered
nothing
about
it
replied
loret
that
is
the
truth
and
the
fact
is
he
is
quite
right
there
is
a
great
difference
between
forgetting
and
not
well
then
added
pelisson
you
bring
your
mite
in
the
shape
of
the
price
of
the
piece
of
land
you
have
sold
sold
no
have
you
not
sold
the
field
then
inquired
gourville
in
astonishment
for
he
knew
the
poet
s
disinterestedness
my
wife
would
not
let
me
replied
the
latter
at
which
there
were
fresh
bursts
of
laughter
and
yet
you
went
to
for
that
purpose
said
some
one
certainly
i
did
and
on
poor
fellow
i
had
eight
different
horses
and
i
was
almost
bumped
to
you
are
an
excellent
fellow
and
you
rested
yourself
when
you
arrived
there
rested
oh
of
course
i
did
for
i
had
an
immense
deal
of
work
to
how
so
my
wife
had
been
flirting
with
the
man
to
whom
i
wished
to
sell
the
land
the
fellow
drew
back
from
his
bargain
and
so
i
challenged
very
good
and
you
fought
it
seems
you
know
nothing
about
it
i
suppose
no
my
wife
and
her
relations
interfered
in
the
matter
i
was
kept
a
quarter
of
an
hour
with
my
sword
in
my
hand
but
i
was
not
and
your
adversary
oh
he
wasn
t
wounded
either
for
he
never
came
on
the
capital
cried
his
friends
from
all
sides
you
must
have
been
terribly
exceedingly
so
i
caught
cold
i
returned
home
and
then
my
wife
began
to
quarrel
with
in
real
earnest
yes
in
real
earnest
she
threw
a
loaf
of
bread
at
my
head
a
large
and
what
did
you
do
oh
i
upset
the
table
over
her
and
her
guests
and
then
i
got
on
my
horse
again
and
here
i
every
one
had
great
difficulty
in
keeping
his
countenance
at
the
exposure
of
this
and
when
the
laughter
had
subsided
one
of
the
guests
present
said
to
la
fontaine
is
that
all
you
have
brought
back
oh
no
i
have
an
excellent
idea
in
my
what
is
it
have
you
noticed
that
there
is
a
good
deal
of
sportive
jesting
poetry
written
in
france
yes
of
course
replied
every
one
and
pursued
la
fontaine
only
a
very
small
portion
of
it
is
the
laws
are
strict
you
that
may
be
but
a
rare
article
is
a
dear
article
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
have
written
a
small
poem
excessively
free
in
its
style
very
broad
and
extremely
cynical
in
its
the
deuce
you
have
yes
continued
the
poet
with
assumed
indifference
and
i
have
introduced
the
greatest
freedom
of
language
i
could
possibly
peals
of
laughter
again
broke
forth
while
the
poet
was
thus
announcing
the
quality
of
his
wares
and
he
continued
i
have
tried
to
excel
everything
that
boccaccio
aretin
and
other
masters
of
their
craft
have
written
in
the
same
its
fate
is
clear
said
pelisson
it
will
be
suppressed
and
do
you
think
so
said
la
fontaine
simply
i
assure
you
i
did
not
do
it
on
my
own
account
so
much
as
fouquet
this
wonderful
conclusion
again
raised
the
mirth
of
all
present
and
i
have
sold
the
first
edition
of
this
little
book
for
eight
hundred
livres
exclaimed
la
fontaine
rubbing
his
hands
together
serious
and
religions
books
sell
at
about
half
that
it
would
have
been
better
said
gourville
to
have
written
two
religious
books
it
would
have
been
too
long
and
not
amusing
enough
replied
la
fontaine
tranquilly
my
eight
hundred
livres
are
in
this
little
bag
and
i
beg
to
offer
them
as
as
he
said
this
he
placed
his
offering
in
the
hands
of
their
treasurer
it
was
then
loret
s
turn
who
gave
a
hundred
and
fifty
livres
the
others
stripped
themselves
in
the
same
way
and
the
total
sum
in
the
purse
amounted
to
forty
thousand
livres
the
money
was
still
being
counted
over
when
the
superintendent
noiselessly
entered
the
room
he
had
heard
everything
and
then
this
man
who
had
possessed
so
many
millions
who
had
exhausted
all
the
pleasures
and
honors
the
world
had
to
bestow
this
generous
heart
this
inexhaustible
brain
which
had
like
two
burning
crucibles
devoured
the
material
and
moral
substance
of
the
first
kingdom
in
europe
was
seen
to
cross
the
threshold
with
tears
in
his
eyes
and
pass
his
fingers
through
the
gold
and
silver
which
the
bag
contained
poor
offering
he
said
in
a
softened
and
affected
tone
of
voice
you
will
disappear
into
the
smallest
corner
of
my
empty
purse
but
you
have
filled
to
overflowing
that
which
no
one
can
ever
exhaust
my
heart
thank
you
my
friends
thank
and
as
he
could
not
embrace
every
one
present
who
were
all
tearful
too
philosophers
as
they
were
he
embraced
la
fontaine
saying
to
him
poor
fellow
so
you
have
on
my
account
been
beaten
by
your
wife
and
censured
by
your
oh
it
is
a
mere
nothing
replied
the
poet
if
your
creditors
will
only
wait
a
couple
of
years
i
shall
have
written
a
hundred
other
tales
which
at
two
editions
each
will
pay
off
the
chapter
xlvi
la
fontaine
in
the
character
of
a
negotiator
fouquet
pressed
la
fontaine
s
hand
most
warmly
saying
to
him
my
dear
poet
write
a
hundred
other
tales
not
only
for
the
eighty
pistoles
which
each
of
them
will
produce
you
but
still
more
to
enrich
our
language
with
a
hundred
new
masterpieces
of
oh
said
la
fontaine
with
a
little
air
of
pride
you
must
not
suppose
that
i
have
only
brought
this
idea
and
the
eighty
pistoles
to
the
oh
indeed
was
the
general
acclamation
from
all
parts
of
the
room
m
de
la
fontaine
is
in
funds
exactly
replied
la
fontaine
quick
quick
cried
the
assembly
take
care
said
pelisson
in
la
fontaine
s
ear
you
have
had
a
most
brilliant
success
up
to
the
present
moment
do
not
go
beyond
your
not
at
all
monsieur
pelisson
and
you
who
are
a
man
of
decided
taste
will
be
the
first
to
approve
of
what
i
have
we
are
talking
of
millions
remember
said
gourville
i
have
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
here
monsieur
gourville
he
replied
striking
himself
on
the
chest
the
deuce
take
this
gascon
from
cried
loret
it
is
not
the
pocket
you
must
tap
but
the
brain
said
fouquet
stay
a
moment
monsieur
le
surintendant
added
la
fontaine
you
are
not
you
are
a
true
true
cried
loret
conrart
and
every
person
present
connected
with
literature
you
are
i
repeat
a
poet
and
a
painter
a
sculptor
a
friend
of
the
arts
and
sciences
but
acknowledge
that
you
are
no
oh
i
do
acknowledge
it
replied
fouquet
smiling
if
you
were
to
be
nominated
at
the
academy
you
would
refuse
i
i
think
i
should
with
all
due
deference
to
the
very
good
if
therefore
you
do
not
wish
to
belong
to
the
academy
why
do
you
allow
yourself
to
form
one
of
the
parliament
oh
said
pelisson
we
are
talking
i
wish
to
know
whether
the
barrister
s
gown
does
or
does
not
become
there
is
no
question
of
the
gown
at
all
retorted
pelisson
annoyed
at
the
laughter
of
those
who
were
present
on
the
contrary
it
is
the
gown
said
loret
take
the
gown
away
from
the
said
conrart
and
we
have
fouquet
left
us
still
of
whom
we
have
no
reason
to
complain
but
as
he
is
no
without
his
gown
we
agree
with
de
la
fontaine
and
pronounce
the
gown
to
be
nothing
but
a
risus
said
loret
the
smiles
and
the
graces
said
some
one
present
that
is
not
the
way
said
pelisson
gravely
that
i
translate
how
do
you
translate
it
said
la
fontaine
thus
the
hares
run
away
as
soon
as
they
see
a
burst
of
laughter
in
which
the
superintendent
joined
followed
this
sally
but
why
hares
objected
conrart
vexed
because
the
hare
will
be
the
very
one
who
will
not
be
over
pleased
to
see
fouquet
surrounded
by
all
the
attributes
which
his
parliamentary
strength
and
power
confer
on
oh
oh
murmured
the
poets
non
said
conrart
seems
impossible
to
me
when
one
is
fortunate
enough
to
wear
the
gown
of
the
on
the
contrary
it
seems
so
to
me
without
that
gown
said
the
obstinate
pelisson
what
is
your
opinion
gourville
i
think
the
gown
in
question
is
a
very
good
thing
replied
the
latter
but
i
equally
think
that
a
million
and
a
half
is
far
better
than
the
and
i
am
of
gourville
s
opinion
exclaimed
fouquet
stopping
the
discussion
by
the
expression
of
his
own
opinion
which
would
necessarily
bear
down
all
the
others
a
million
and
a
half
pelisson
grumbled
out
now
i
happen
to
know
an
indian
fable
tell
it
to
me
said
la
fontaine
i
ought
to
know
it
tell
it
tell
it
said
the
others
there
was
a
tortoise
which
was
as
usual
well
protected
by
its
shell
said
pelisson
whenever
its
enemies
threatened
it
it
took
refuge
within
its
covering
one
day
some
one
said
to
it
you
must
feel
very
hot
in
such
a
house
as
that
in
the
summer
and
you
are
altogether
prevented
showing
off
your
graces
there
is
a
snake
here
who
will
give
you
a
million
and
a
half
for
your
good
said
the
superintendent
laughing
well
what
next
said
la
fontaine
more
interested
in
the
apologue
than
in
the
moral
the
tortoise
sold
his
shell
and
remained
naked
and
defenseless
a
vulture
happened
to
see
him
and
being
hungry
broke
the
tortoise
s
back
with
a
blow
of
his
beak
and
devoured
it
the
moral
is
that
fouquet
should
take
very
good
care
to
keep
his
la
fontaine
understood
the
moral
seriously
you
forget
aeschylus
he
said
to
his
adversary
what
do
you
mean
aeschylus
was
and
a
vulture
your
vulture
probably
who
was
a
great
amateur
in
tortoises
mistook
at
a
distance
his
head
for
a
block
of
stone
and
let
a
tortoise
which
was
shrunk
up
in
his
shell
fall
upon
yes
yes
la
fontaine
is
right
resumed
fouquet
who
had
become
very
thoughtful
whenever
a
vulture
wishes
to
devour
a
tortoise
he
well
knows
how
to
break
his
shell
but
happy
is
that
tortoise
a
snake
pays
a
million
and
a
half
for
his
envelope
if
any
one
were
to
bring
me
a
snake
like
the
one
in
your
fable
pelisson
i
would
give
him
my
avis
in
terres
cried
conrart
and
like
a
black
swan
is
he
not
added
la
fontaine
well
then
the
bird
in
question
black
and
rare
is
already
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
have
found
a
purchaser
for
my
post
of
exclaimed
fouquet
i
have
but
the
superintendent
never
said
that
he
wished
to
sell
resumed
pelisson
i
beg
your
pardon
said
conrart
you
yourself
spoke
about
it
even
yes
i
am
a
witness
to
that
said
gourville
he
seems
very
tenacious
about
his
brilliant
idea
said
fouquet
laughing
well
la
fontaine
who
is
the
purchaser
a
perfect
blackbird
for
he
is
a
counselor
belonging
to
the
parliament
an
excellent
what
is
his
name
vanel
exclaimed
fouquet
vanel
the
husband
of
precisely
her
husband
yes
poor
fellow
said
fouquet
with
an
expression
of
great
interest
he
wishes
to
be
everything
that
you
have
been
monsieur
said
gourville
and
to
do
everything
that
you
have
it
is
very
agreeable
tell
us
all
about
it
la
it
is
very
simple
i
see
him
occasionally
and
a
short
time
ago
i
met
him
walking
about
on
the
place
de
la
bastile
at
the
very
moment
when
i
was
about
to
take
the
small
carriage
to
come
down
here
to
he
must
have
been
watching
his
wife
interrupted
loret
oh
no
said
la
fontaine
he
is
far
from
being
jealous
he
accosted
me
embraced
me
and
took
me
to
the
inn
called
l
image
and
told
me
all
about
his
he
has
his
troubles
then
yes
his
wife
wants
to
make
him
well
and
he
told
you
that
some
one
had
spoken
to
him
about
a
post
in
parliament
that
fouquet
s
name
had
been
mentioned
that
ever
since
madame
vanel
dreams
of
nothing
else
than
being
called
madame
la
and
that
it
makes
her
ill
and
kills
her
every
night
she
does
not
dream
about
the
deuce
poor
woman
said
fouquet
wait
a
moment
conrart
is
always
telling
me
that
i
do
not
know
how
to
conduct
matters
of
business
you
will
see
how
i
managed
this
well
go
i
suppose
you
know
said
i
to
vanel
that
the
value
of
a
post
such
as
that
which
fouquet
holds
is
by
no
means
how
much
do
you
imagine
it
to
be
he
said
m
fouquet
i
know
has
refused
seventeen
hundred
thousand
my
wife
replied
vanel
had
estimated
it
at
about
fourteen
hundred
ready
money
i
said
yes
she
has
sold
some
property
of
hers
in
guienne
and
has
received
the
purchase
that
s
a
pretty
sum
to
touch
all
at
once
said
the
abbe
fouquet
who
had
not
hitherto
said
a
word
poor
madame
vanel
murmured
fouquet
pelisson
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
he
whispered
in
fouquet
s
ear
that
woman
is
a
perfect
that
may
be
and
it
will
be
delightful
to
make
use
of
this
fiend
s
money
to
repair
the
injury
which
an
angel
has
done
herself
for
pelisson
looked
with
a
surprised
air
at
fouquet
whose
thoughts
were
from
that
moment
fixed
upon
a
fresh
object
in
view
well
inquired
la
fontaine
what
about
my
negotiation
admirable
my
dear
yes
said
gourville
but
there
are
some
people
who
are
anxious
to
have
the
steed
who
have
not
even
money
enough
to
pay
for
the
and
vanel
would
draw
back
from
his
offer
if
he
were
to
be
taken
at
his
word
continued
the
abbe
fouquet
i
do
not
believe
it
said
la
fontaine
what
do
you
know
about
it
why
you
have
not
yet
heard
the
of
my
if
there
is
a
why
do
you
beat
about
the
bush
so
much
ad
is
that
correct
said
fouquet
with
the
air
of
a
nobleman
who
condescends
to
barbarisms
to
which
the
latinists
present
answered
with
loud
applause
my
cried
la
fontaine
is
that
vanel
that
determined
blackbird
knowing
that
i
was
coming
to
implored
me
to
bring
him
with
me
and
if
possible
to
present
him
to
so
that
so
that
he
is
here
i
left
him
in
that
part
of
the
ground
called
well
fouquet
what
is
your
reply
well
it
is
not
respectful
towards
madame
vanel
that
her
husband
should
run
the
risk
of
catching
cold
outside
my
house
send
for
him
la
fontaine
since
you
know
where
he
i
will
go
and
i
will
accompany
you
said
the
abbe
fouquet
i
will
carry
the
money
no
jesting
said
fouquet
seriously
let
the
business
be
a
serious
one
if
it
is
to
be
one
at
all
but
first
of
all
let
us
show
we
are
hospitable
make
my
apologies
la
fontaine
to
vanel
and
tell
him
how
distressed
i
am
to
have
kept
him
waiting
but
that
i
was
not
aware
he
was
la
fontaine
set
off
at
once
fortunately
accompanied
by
gourville
for
absorbed
in
his
own
calculations
the
poet
would
have
mistaken
the
route
and
was
hurrying
as
fast
as
he
could
towards
the
village
of
within
a
quarter
of
an
hour
afterwards
vanel
was
introduced
into
the
superintendent
s
cabinet
a
description
of
which
has
already
been
given
at
the
beginning
of
this
story
when
fouquet
saw
him
enter
he
called
to
pelisson
and
whispered
a
few
words
in
his
ear
do
not
lose
a
single
word
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
let
all
the
silver
and
gold
plate
together
with
my
jewels
of
every
description
be
packed
up
in
the
carriage
you
will
take
the
black
horses
the
jeweler
will
accompany
you
and
you
will
postpone
the
supper
until
madame
de
belliere
s
will
it
be
necessary
to
inform
madame
de
belliere
of
it
said
pelisson
no
that
will
be
useless
i
will
do
that
so
away
with
you
my
dear
pelisson
set
off
not
quite
clear
as
to
his
friend
s
meaning
or
intention
but
confident
like
every
true
friend
in
the
judgment
of
the
man
he
was
blindly
obeying
it
is
that
which
constitutes
the
strength
of
such
men
distrust
only
arises
in
the
minds
of
inferior
natures
vanel
bowed
lowly
to
the
superintendent
and
was
about
to
begin
a
speech
do
not
trouble
yourself
monsieur
said
fouquet
politely
i
am
told
you
wish
to
purchase
a
post
i
hold
how
much
can
you
give
me
for
it
it
is
for
you
monseigneur
to
fix
the
amount
you
require
i
know
that
offers
of
purchase
have
already
been
made
to
you
for
madame
vanel
i
have
been
told
values
it
at
fourteen
hundred
thousand
that
is
all
we
can
you
give
me
the
money
immediately
i
have
not
the
money
with
me
said
vanel
frightened
almost
by
the
unpretending
simplicity
amounting
to
greatness
of
the
man
for
he
had
expected
disputes
difficulties
opposition
of
every
kind
when
will
you
be
able
to
bring
it
whenever
you
please
monseigneur
for
he
began
to
be
afraid
that
fouquet
was
trifling
with
him
if
it
were
not
for
the
trouble
you
would
have
in
returning
to
paris
i
would
say
at
once
but
we
will
arrange
that
the
payment
and
the
signature
shall
take
place
at
six
o
clock
very
good
said
vanel
as
cold
as
ice
and
feeling
quite
bewildered
adieu
monsieur
vanel
present
my
humblest
respects
to
madame
vanel
said
fouquet
as
he
rose
upon
which
vanel
who
felt
the
blood
rushing
to
his
head
for
he
was
quite
confounded
by
his
success
said
seriously
to
the
superintendent
will
you
give
me
your
word
monseigneur
upon
this
affair
fouquet
turned
round
his
head
saying
and
you
monsieur
vanel
hesitated
trembled
all
over
and
at
last
finished
by
hesitatingly
holding
out
his
hand
fouquet
opened
and
nobly
extended
his
own
this
loyal
hand
lay
for
a
moment
in
vanel
s
most
hypocritical
palm
and
he
pressed
it
in
his
own
in
order
the
better
to
convince
himself
of
the
compact
the
superintendent
gently
disengaged
his
hand
as
he
again
said
and
then
vanel
ran
hastily
to
the
door
hurried
along
the
vestibule
and
fled
as
quickly
as
he
could
chapter
xlvii
madame
de
belliere
s
plate
and
diamonds
fouquet
had
no
sooner
dismissed
vanel
than
he
began
to
reflect
for
a
few
moments
a
man
never
can
do
too
much
for
the
woman
he
has
once
loved
marguerite
wishes
to
be
the
wife
of
a
and
why
not
confer
this
pleasure
upon
her
and
now
that
the
most
scrupulous
and
sensitive
conscience
will
be
unable
to
reproach
me
with
anything
let
my
thoughts
be
bestowed
on
her
who
has
shown
so
much
devotion
for
me
madame
de
belliere
ought
to
be
there
by
this
time
he
said
as
he
turned
towards
the
secret
door
after
he
had
locked
himself
in
he
opened
the
subterranean
passage
and
rapidly
hastened
towards
the
means
of
communicating
between
the
house
at
vincennes
and
his
own
residence
he
had
neglected
to
apprise
his
friend
of
his
approach
by
ringing
the
bell
perfectly
assured
that
she
would
never
fail
to
be
exact
at
the
rendezvous
as
indeed
was
the
case
for
she
was
already
waiting
the
noise
the
superintendent
made
aroused
her
she
ran
to
take
from
under
the
door
the
letter
he
had
thrust
there
and
which
simply
said
come
marquise
we
are
waiting
supper
for
with
her
heart
filled
with
happiness
madame
de
belliere
ran
to
her
carriage
in
the
avenue
de
vincennes
and
in
a
few
minutes
she
was
holding
out
her
hand
to
gourville
who
was
standing
at
the
entrance
where
in
order
the
better
to
please
his
master
he
had
stationed
himself
to
watch
her
arrival
she
had
not
observed
that
fouquet
s
black
horse
arrived
at
the
same
time
all
steaming
and
having
returned
to
with
pelisson
and
the
very
jeweler
to
whom
madame
de
belliere
had
sold
her
plate
and
her
jewels
pelisson
introduced
the
goldsmith
into
the
cabinet
which
fouquet
had
not
yet
left
the
superintendent
thanked
him
for
having
been
good
enough
to
regard
as
a
simple
deposit
in
his
hands
the
valuable
property
which
he
had
every
right
to
sell
and
he
cast
his
eyes
on
the
total
of
the
account
which
amounted
to
thirteen
hundred
thousand
francs
then
going
for
a
few
moments
to
his
desk
he
wrote
an
order
for
fourteen
hundred
thousand
francs
payable
at
sight
at
his
treasury
before
twelve
o
clock
the
next
day
a
hundred
thousand
francs
profit
cried
the
goldsmith
oh
monseigneur
what
generosity
nay
nay
not
so
monsieur
said
fouquet
touching
him
on
the
shoulder
there
are
certain
kindnesses
which
can
never
be
repaid
this
profit
is
only
what
you
have
earned
but
the
interest
of
your
money
still
remains
to
be
and
saying
this
he
unfastened
from
his
sleeve
a
diamond
button
which
the
goldsmith
himself
had
often
valued
at
three
thousand
pistoles
take
this
he
said
to
the
goldsmith
in
remembrance
of
me
farewell
you
are
an
honest
and
you
monseigneur
cried
the
goldsmith
completely
overcome
are
the
noblest
man
that
ever
fouquet
let
the
worthy
goldsmith
pass
out
of
the
room
by
a
secret
door
and
then
went
to
receive
madame
de
belliere
who
was
already
surrounded
by
all
the
guests
the
marquise
was
always
beautiful
but
now
her
loveliness
was
more
dazzling
than
ever
do
you
not
think
gentlemen
said
fouquet
that
madame
is
more
than
usually
beautiful
this
evening
and
do
you
happen
to
know
why
because
madame
is
really
the
most
beautiful
of
all
women
said
some
one
present
no
but
because
she
is
the
best
and
yet
yet
said
the
marquise
smiling
and
yet
all
the
jewels
which
madame
is
wearing
this
evening
are
nothing
but
false
at
this
remark
the
marquise
blushed
most
painfully
oh
oh
exclaimed
all
the
guests
that
can
very
well
be
said
of
one
who
has
the
finest
diamonds
in
well
said
fouquet
to
pelisson
in
a
low
tone
well
at
last
i
have
understood
you
returned
the
latter
and
you
have
done
exceedingly
supper
is
ready
monseigneur
said
vatel
with
majestic
air
and
tone
the
crowd
of
guests
hurried
more
quickly
than
is
usually
the
case
with
ministerial
entertainments
towards
the
where
a
magnificent
spectacle
presented
itself
upon
the
buffets
upon
the
upon
the
itself
in
the
midst
of
flowers
and
light
glittered
most
dazzlingly
the
richest
and
most
costly
gold
and
silver
plate
that
could
possibly
be
seen
relics
of
those
ancient
magnificent
productions
the
florentine
artists
whom
the
medici
family
patronized
sculptured
chased
and
moulded
for
the
purpose
of
holding
flowers
at
a
time
when
gold
existed
still
in
france
these
hidden
marvels
which
had
been
buried
during
the
civil
wars
timidly
reappeared
during
the
intervals
of
that
war
of
good
taste
called
la
fronde
at
a
time
when
noblemen
fighting
against
nobleman
killed
but
did
not
pillage
each
other
all
the
plate
present
had
madame
de
belliere
s
arms
engraved
upon
it
look
cried
la
fontaine
here
is
a
p
and
a
but
the
most
remarkable
object
present
was
the
cover
which
fouquet
had
assigned
to
the
marquise
near
her
was
a
pyramid
of
diamonds
sapphires
emeralds
antique
cameos
sardonyx
stones
carved
by
the
old
greeks
of
asia
minor
with
mountings
of
mysian
gold
curious
mosaics
of
ancient
alexandria
set
in
silver
massive
egyptian
bracelets
lay
heaped
on
a
large
plate
of
palissy
ware
supported
by
a
tripod
of
gilt
bronze
sculptured
by
benvenuto
cellini
the
marquise
turned
pale
as
she
recognized
what
she
had
never
expected
to
see
again
a
profound
silence
fell
on
every
one
of
the
restless
and
excited
guests
fouquet
did
not
even
make
a
sign
in
dismissal
of
the
richly
liveried
servants
who
crowded
like
bees
round
the
huge
buffets
and
other
tables
in
the
room
gentlemen
he
said
all
this
plate
which
you
behold
once
belonged
to
madame
de
belliere
who
having
observed
one
of
her
friends
in
great
distress
sent
all
this
gold
and
silver
together
with
the
heap
of
jewels
now
before
her
to
her
goldsmith
this
noble
conduct
of
a
devoted
friend
can
well
be
understood
by
such
friends
as
you
happy
indeed
is
that
man
who
sees
himself
loved
in
such
a
manner
let
us
drink
to
the
health
of
madame
de
a
tremendous
burst
of
applause
followed
his
words
and
made
poor
madame
de
belliere
sink
back
dumb
and
breathless
in
her
seat
and
then
added
pelisson
who
was
always
affected
by
a
noble
action
as
he
was
invariably
impressed
by
beauty
let
us
also
drink
to
the
health
of
him
who
inspired
madame
s
noble
conduct
for
such
a
man
is
worthy
of
being
worthily
it
was
now
the
marquise
s
turn
she
rose
pale
and
smiling
and
as
she
held
out
her
glass
with
a
faltering
hand
and
her
trembling
fingers
touched
those
of
fouquet
her
look
full
of
love
found
its
mirror
in
that
of
her
ardent
and
lover
begun
in
this
manner
the
supper
soon
became
a
no
one
tried
to
be
witty
but
no
one
failed
in
being
so
la
fontaine
forgot
his
gorgny
wine
and
allowed
vatel
to
reconcile
him
to
the
wines
of
the
rhone
and
those
from
the
shores
of
spain
the
abbe
fouquet
became
so
kind
and
that
gourville
said
to
him
take
care
monsieur
l
abbe
if
you
are
so
tender
you
will
be
carved
and
the
hours
passed
away
so
joyously
that
contrary
to
his
usual
custom
the
superintendent
did
not
leave
the
table
before
the
end
of
the
dessert
he
smiled
upon
his
friends
delighted
as
a
man
is
whose
heart
becomes
intoxicated
before
his
head
and
for
the
first
time
looked
at
the
clock
suddenly
a
carriage
rolled
into
the
courtyard
and
strange
to
say
it
was
heard
high
above
the
noise
of
the
mirth
which
prevailed
fouquet
listened
attentively
and
then
turned
his
eyes
towards
the
it
seemed
as
if
he
could
hear
a
step
passing
across
it
a
step
that
instead
of
pressing
the
ground
weighed
heavily
upon
his
heart
m
d
herblay
bishop
of
vannes
the
usher
announced
and
aramis
s
grave
and
thoughtful
face
appeared
upon
the
threshold
of
the
door
between
the
remains
of
two
garlands
of
which
the
flame
of
a
lamp
had
just
burnt
the
thread
that
once
united
them
chapter

de
mazarin
s
receipt
fouquet
would
have
uttered
an
exclamation
of
delight
on
seeing
another
friend
arrive
if
the
cold
air
and
averted
aspect
of
aramis
had
not
restored
all
his
reserve
are
you
going
to
join
us
at
dessert
he
asked
and
yet
you
would
be
frightened
perhaps
at
the
noise
which
our
wild
friends
here
are
making
monseigneur
replied
aramis
respectfully
i
will
begin
by
begging
you
to
excuse
me
for
having
interrupted
this
merry
meeting
and
then
i
will
beg
you
to
give
me
as
soon
as
your
pleasure
is
attended
to
a
moment
s
audience
on
matters
of
as
the
word
business
had
aroused
the
attention
of
some
of
the
epicureans
present
fouquet
rose
saying
business
first
of
all
monsieur
d
herblay
we
are
too
happy
when
matters
of
business
arrive
only
at
the
end
of
a
as
he
said
this
he
took
the
hand
of
madame
de
belliere
who
looked
at
him
with
a
kind
of
uneasiness
and
then
led
her
to
an
adjoining
after
having
recommended
her
to
the
most
reasonable
of
his
guests
and
then
taking
aramis
by
the
arm
he
led
him
towards
his
cabinet
as
soon
as
aramis
was
there
throwing
aside
the
respectful
air
he
had
assumed
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
saying
guess
whom
i
have
seen
this
evening
my
dear
chevalier
every
time
you
begin
in
that
manner
i
am
sure
to
hear
you
announce
something
well
and
this
time
you
will
not
be
mistaken
either
my
dear
friend
replied
aramis
do
not
keep
me
in
suspense
added
fouquet
phlegmatically
well
then
i
have
seen
madame
de
the
old
duchesse
do
you
mean
her
ghost
perhaps
no
no
the
old
without
teeth
possibly
but
not
without
well
what
harm
can
she
meditate
against
me
i
am
no
miser
with
women
who
are
not
prudes
a
quality
always
prized
even
by
the
woman
who
no
longer
presumes
to
look
for
madame
de
chevreuse
knows
very
well
that
you
are
not
avaricious
since
she
wishes
to
draw
some
money
of
indeed
under
what
pretext
oh
pretexts
are
never
wanting
with
let
me
tell
you
what
it
is
it
seems
that
the
duchesse
has
a
good
many
letters
of
de
mazarin
s
in
her
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
for
the
prelate
was
gallant
yes
but
these
letters
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
prelate
s
love
affairs
they
concern
it
is
said
financial
matters
and
accordingly
they
are
less
do
you
not
suspect
what
i
mean
not
at
have
you
never
heard
speak
of
a
prosecution
being
instituted
for
an
embezzlement
or
appropriation
rather
of
public
funds
yes
a
hundred
nay
a
thousand
times
ever
since
i
have
been
engaged
in
public
matters
i
have
hardly
heard
of
anything
else
it
is
precisely
your
own
case
when
as
a
bishop
people
reproach
you
for
impiety
or
as
a
musketeer
for
your
cowardice
the
very
thing
of
which
they
are
always
accusing
ministers
of
finance
is
the
embezzlement
of
public
very
good
but
take
a
particular
instance
for
the
duchesse
asserts
that
de
mazarin
alludes
to
certain
particular
what
are
they
something
like
a
sum
of
thirteen
millions
of
francs
of
which
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
you
to
define
the
precise
nature
of
the
thirteen
millions
said
the
superintendent
stretching
himself
in
his
armchair
in
order
to
enable
him
the
more
comfortably
to
look
up
towards
the
ceiling
thirteen
millions
i
am
trying
to
remember
out
of
all
those
i
have
been
accused
of
having
do
not
laugh
my
dear
monsieur
for
it
is
very
serious
it
is
positive
that
the
duchesse
has
certain
letters
in
her
possession
and
that
these
letters
must
be
as
she
represents
them
since
she
wished
to
sell
them
to
me
for
five
hundred
thousand
oh
one
can
have
a
very
tolerable
calumny
got
up
for
such
a
sum
as
that
replied
fouquet
ah
now
i
know
what
you
mean
and
he
began
to
laugh
very
heartily
so
much
the
better
said
aramis
a
little
reassured
i
remember
the
story
of
those
thirteen
millions
now
yes
yes
i
remember
them
quite
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
tell
me
about
well
then
one
day
signor
mazarin
heaven
rest
his
soul
made
a
profit
of
thirteen
millions
upon
a
concession
of
lands
in
the
valtelline
he
canceled
them
in
the
registry
of
receipts
sent
them
to
me
and
then
made
me
advance
them
to
him
for
war
very
good
then
there
is
no
doubt
of
their
proper
no
the
cardinal
made
me
invest
them
in
my
own
name
and
gave
me
a
you
have
the
receipt
of
course
said
fouquet
as
he
quietly
rose
from
his
chair
and
went
to
his
large
ebony
bureau
inlaid
with
and
gold
what
i
most
admire
in
you
said
aramis
with
an
air
of
great
satisfaction
is
your
memory
in
the
first
place
then
your
and
finally
the
perfect
order
which
prevails
in
your
administration
you
of
all
men
too
who
are
by
nature
a
yes
said
fouquet
i
am
orderly
out
of
a
spirit
of
idleness
to
save
myself
the
trouble
of
looking
after
things
and
so
i
know
that
mazarin
s
receipt
is
in
the
third
drawer
under
the
letter
m
i
open
the
drawer
and
place
my
hand
upon
the
very
paper
i
need
in
the
night
without
a
light
i
could
find
and
with
a
confident
hand
he
felt
the
bundle
of
papers
which
were
piled
up
in
the
open
drawer
nay
more
than
that
he
continued
i
remember
the
paper
as
if
i
saw
it
it
is
thick
somewhat
crumpled
with
gilt
edges
mazarin
had
made
a
blot
upon
the
figure
of
the
date
ah
he
said
the
paper
knows
we
are
talking
about
it
and
that
we
want
it
very
much
and
so
it
hides
itself
out
of
the
and
as
the
superintendent
looked
into
the
drawer
aramis
rose
from
his
seat
this
is
very
singular
said
fouquet
your
memory
is
treacherous
my
dear
monseigneur
look
in
another
fouquet
took
out
the
bundle
of
papers
and
turned
them
over
once
more
he
then
grew
very
pale
don
t
confine
your
search
to
that
drawer
said
aramis
look
quite
useless
i
have
never
made
a
mistake
no
one
but
myself
arranges
any
papers
of
mine
of
this
nature
no
one
but
myself
ever
opens
this
drawer
of
which
besides
no
one
myself
excepted
is
aware
of
the
what
do
you
conclude
then
said
aramis
agitated
that
mazarin
s
receipt
has
been
stolen
from
me
madame
de
chevreuse
was
right
chevalier
i
have
appropriated
the
public
funds
i
have
robbed
the
state
coffers
of
thirteen
millions
of
money
i
am
a
thief
monsieur
d
nay
nay
do
not
get
irritated
do
not
get
and
why
not
chevalier
surely
there
is
every
reason
for
it
if
legal
proceedings
are
well
arranged
and
a
judgment
given
in
accordance
with
them
your
friend
the
superintendent
will
soon
follow
montfaucon
his
colleague
enguerrand
de
marigny
and
his
predecessor
oh
said
aramis
smiling
not
so
fast
as
and
why
not
why
not
so
fast
what
do
you
suppose
madame
de
chevreuse
has
done
with
those
letters
for
you
refused
them
i
suppose
yes
at
once
i
suppose
that
she
went
and
sold
them
to
well
i
said
i
supposed
so
i
might
have
said
i
was
sure
of
it
for
i
had
her
followed
and
when
she
left
me
she
returned
to
her
own
house
went
out
by
a
back
door
and
proceeded
straight
to
the
intendant
s
house
in
the
rue
croix
des
legal
proceedings
will
be
instituted
then
scandal
and
dishonor
will
follow
and
all
will
fall
upon
me
like
a
thunderbolt
blindly
aramis
approached
fouquet
who
sat
trembling
in
his
chair
close
to
the
open
drawers
he
placed
his
hand
on
his
shoulder
and
in
an
affectionate
tone
of
voice
said
do
not
forget
that
the
position
of
fouquet
can
in
no
way
be
compared
to
that
of
semblancay
or
of
and
why
not
in
heaven
s
name
because
the
proceedings
against
those
ministers
were
determined
completed
and
the
sentence
carried
out
whilst
in
your
case
the
same
thing
can
not
take
another
blow
why
not
a
peculator
is
under
any
circumstances
a
criminals
who
know
how
to
find
a
safe
asylum
are
never
in
what
make
my
escape
fly
no
i
do
not
mean
that
you
forget
that
all
such
proceedings
originate
in
the
parliament
that
they
are
instituted
by
the
and
that
you
are
the
you
see
that
unless
you
wish
to
condemn
yourself
oh
cried
fouquet
suddenly
dashing
his
fist
upon
the
table
well
what
what
is
the
matter
i
am
no
aramis
at
this
reply
became
as
livid
as
death
he
pressed
his
hands
together
convulsively
and
with
a
wild
haggard
look
which
almost
annihilated
fouquet
he
said
laying
a
stress
on
every
distinct
syllable
you
are
no
longer
do
you
say
since
when
since
the
last
four
or
five
take
care
interrupted
aramis
coldly
i
do
not
think
you
are
in
the
full
possession
of
your
senses
my
friend
collect
i
tell
you
returned
fouquet
that
a
little
while
ago
some
one
came
to
me
brought
by
my
friends
to
offer
me
fourteen
hundred
thousand
francs
for
the
appointment
and
that
i
sold
aramis
looked
as
though
he
had
been
struck
by
lightning
the
intelligent
and
mocking
expression
of
his
countenance
assumed
an
aspect
of
such
profound
gloom
and
terror
that
it
had
more
effect
upon
the
superintendent
than
all
the
exclamations
and
speeches
in
the
world
you
had
need
of
money
then
he
said
at
last
yes
to
discharge
a
debt
of
and
in
a
few
words
he
gave
aramis
an
account
of
madame
de
belliere
s
generosity
and
the
manner
in
which
he
had
thought
it
but
right
to
discharge
that
act
of
generosity
yes
said
aramis
that
is
indeed
a
fine
trait
what
has
it
cost
exactly
the
fourteen
hundred
thousand
francs
the
price
of
my
which
you
received
in
that
manner
without
reflection
oh
imprudent
man
i
have
not
yet
received
the
amount
but
i
shall
it
is
not
yet
completed
then
it
must
be
carried
out
though
for
i
have
given
the
goldsmith
for
twelve
o
clock
an
order
upon
my
treasury
into
which
the
purchaser
s
money
will
be
paid
at
six
or
seven
o
heaven
be
praised
cried
aramis
clapping
his
hands
together
nothing
is
yet
completed
since
you
have
not
yet
been
but
the
goldsmith
you
shall
receive
the
fourteen
hundred
thousand
francs
from
me
at
a
quarter
before
stay
a
moment
it
is
at
six
o
clock
this
very
morning
that
i
am
to
oh
i
will
answer
that
you
do
not
i
have
given
my
word
if
you
have
given
it
you
will
take
it
back
again
that
is
can
i
believe
what
i
hear
cried
fouquet
in
a
most
expressive
tone
fouquet
recall
his
word
after
it
has
once
been
pledged
aramis
replied
to
the
almost
stern
look
of
the
minister
by
a
look
full
of
anger
monsieur
he
said
i
believe
i
have
deserved
to
be
called
a
man
of
honor
as
a
soldier
i
have
risked
my
life
five
hundred
times
as
a
priest
i
have
rendered
still
greater
services
both
to
the
state
and
to
my
friends
the
value
of
a
word
once
passed
is
estimated
according
to
the
worth
of
the
man
who
gives
it
so
long
as
it
is
in
his
own
keeping
it
is
of
the
purest
finest
gold
when
his
wish
to
keep
it
has
passed
away
it
is
a
sword
with
that
word
therefore
he
defends
himself
as
with
an
honorable
weapon
considering
that
when
he
disregards
his
word
he
endangers
his
life
and
incurs
an
amount
of
risk
far
greater
than
that
which
his
adversary
is
likely
to
derive
of
profit
in
such
a
case
monsieur
he
appeals
to
heaven
and
to
fouquet
bent
down
his
head
as
he
replied
i
am
a
poor
man
a
true
breton
born
my
mind
admires
and
fears
yours
i
do
not
say
that
i
keep
my
word
from
a
proper
feeling
only
i
keep
it
if
you
like
from
custom
practice
pride
or
what
you
will
but
at
all
events
the
ordinary
run
of
men
are
simple
enough
to
admire
this
custom
of
mine
it
is
my
sole
good
quality
leave
me
such
honor
as
it
and
so
you
are
determined
to
sign
the
sale
of
the
very
appointment
which
can
alone
defend
you
against
all
your
yes
i
shall
you
will
deliver
yourself
up
then
bound
hand
and
foot
from
a
false
notion
of
honor
which
the
most
scrupulous
casuists
would
disdain
i
shall
sign
repeated
fouquet
aramis
sighed
deeply
and
looked
all
round
him
with
the
impatient
gesture
of
a
man
who
would
gladly
dash
something
to
pieces
as
a
relief
to
his
feelings
we
have
still
one
means
left
he
said
and
i
trust
you
will
not
refuse
me
to
make
use
of
certainly
not
if
it
be
loyal
and
honorable
as
everything
is
in
fact
which
you
i
know
nothing
more
loyal
than
the
renunciation
of
your
purchaser
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
certainly
but
but
if
you
allow
me
to
manage
the
affair
i
do
not
oh
you
shall
be
absolutely
master
to
do
what
you
whom
are
you
in
treaty
with
what
manner
of
man
is
it
i
am
not
aware
whether
you
know
the
most
of
its
members
one
of
the
presidents
perhaps
no
only
a
counselor
of
the
name
of
aramis
became
perfectly
purple
vanel
he
cried
rising
abruptly
from
his
seat
vanel
the
husband
of
marguerite
vanel
of
your
former
mistress
yes
my
dear
fellow
she
is
anxious
to
be
the
wife
of
the
i
certainly
owed
poor
vanel
that
slight
concession
and
i
am
a
gainer
by
it
since
i
at
the
same
time
can
confer
a
pleasure
on
his
aramis
walked
straight
up
to
fouquet
and
took
hold
of
his
hand
do
you
know
he
said
very
calmly
the
name
of
madame
vanel
s
new
lover
ah
she
has
a
new
lover
then
i
was
not
aware
of
it
no
i
have
no
idea
what
his
name
his
name
is
colbert
he
is
intendant
of
the
finances
he
lives
in
the
rue
croix
des
where
madame
de
chevreuse
has
been
this
evening
to
take
him
mazarin
s
letters
which
she
wishes
to
gracious
heaven
murmured
fouquet
passing
his
hand
across
his
forehead
from
which
the
perspiration
was
starting
you
now
begin
to
understand
do
you
not
that
i
am
utterly
lost
do
you
now
think
it
worth
while
to
be
so
scrupulous
with
regard
to
keeping
your
word
yes
said
fouquet
these
obstinate
people
always
contrive
matters
in
such
a
way
that
one
can
not
but
admire
them
all
the
while
murmured
aramis
fouquet
held
out
his
hand
to
him
and
at
the
very
moment
a
richly
ornamented
clock
supported
by
golden
figures
which
was
standing
on
a
console
table
opposite
to
the
fireplace
struck
six
the
sound
of
a
door
being
opened
in
the
vestibule
was
heard
and
gourville
came
to
the
door
of
the
cabinet
to
inquire
if
fouquet
would
received
vanel
fouquet
turned
his
eyes
from
the
gaze
of
aramis
and
then
desired
that
vanel
should
be
shown
in
chapter
xlix
monsieur
colbert
s
rough
draft
vanel
who
entered
at
this
stage
of
the
conversation
was
nothing
less
for
aramis
and
fouquet
than
the
full
stop
which
completes
a
phrase
but
for
vanel
aramis
s
presence
in
fouquet
s
cabinet
had
quite
another
signification
and
therefore
at
his
first
step
into
the
room
he
paused
as
he
looked
at
the
delicate
yet
firm
features
of
the
bishop
of
vannes
and
his
look
of
astonishment
soon
became
one
of
scrutinizing
attention
as
for
fouquet
a
perfect
politician
that
is
to
say
complete
master
of
himself
he
had
already
by
the
energy
of
his
own
resolute
will
contrived
to
remove
from
his
face
all
traces
of
the
emotion
which
aramis
s
revelation
had
occasioned
he
was
no
longer
therefore
a
man
overwhelmed
by
misfortune
and
reduced
to
resort
to
expedients
he
held
his
head
proudly
erect
and
indicated
by
a
gesture
that
vanel
could
enter
he
was
now
the
first
minister
of
the
state
and
in
his
own
palace
aramis
knew
the
superintendent
well
the
delicacy
of
the
feelings
of
his
heart
and
the
exalted
nature
of
his
mind
no
longer
surprised
him
he
confined
himself
then
for
the
moment
intending
to
resume
later
an
active
part
in
the
conversation
to
the
performance
of
the
difficult
part
of
a
man
who
looks
on
and
listens
in
order
to
learn
and
understand
vanel
was
visibly
overcome
and
advanced
into
the
middle
of
the
cabinet
bowing
to
everything
and
everybody
i
am
here
he
said
you
are
punctual
monsieur
vanel
returned
fouquet
in
matters
of
business
monseigneur
replied
vanel
i
look
upon
exactitude
as
a
no
doubt
i
beg
your
pardon
interrupted
aramis
indicating
vanel
with
his
finger
but
addressing
himself
to
fouquet
this
is
the
gentleman
i
believe
who
has
come
about
the
purchase
of
your
appointment
yes
i
am
replied
vanel
astonished
at
the
extremely
haughty
tone
in
which
aramis
had
put
the
question
but
in
what
way
am
i
to
address
you
who
do
me
the
honor
call
me
monseigneur
replied
aramis
dryly
vanel
bowed
come
gentlemen
a
truce
to
these
ceremonies
let
us
proceed
to
the
matter
monseigneur
sees
said
vanel
that
i
am
waiting
your
on
the
contrary
i
am
waiting
replied
fouquet
what
for
may
i
be
permitted
to
ask
monseigneur
i
thought
that
you
had
perhaps
something
to
oh
said
vanel
to
himself
he
has
reflected
on
the
matter
and
i
am
but
resuming
his
courage
he
continued
no
monseigneur
nothing
absolutely
nothing
more
than
what
i
said
to
you
yesterday
and
which
i
am
again
ready
to
repeat
to
you
come
now
tell
me
frankly
monsieur
vanel
is
not
the
affair
rather
a
burdensome
one
for
you
certainly
monseigneur
fourteen
hundred
thousand
francs
is
an
important
so
important
indeed
said
fouquet
that
i
have
reflected
you
have
been
reflecting
do
you
say
monseigneur
exclaimed
vanel
anxiously
yes
that
you
might
not
yet
be
in
a
position
to
oh
monseigneur
do
not
make
yourself
uneasy
on
that
score
monsieur
vanel
i
shall
not
blame
you
for
a
failure
in
your
word
which
evidently
may
arise
from
inability
on
your
oh
yes
monseigneur
you
would
blame
me
and
you
would
be
right
in
doing
so
said
vanel
for
a
man
must
either
be
very
imprudent
or
a
fool
to
undertake
engagements
which
he
can
not
keep
and
i
at
least
have
always
regarded
a
thing
agreed
on
as
a
thing
actually
carried
fouquet
colored
while
aramis
uttered
a
hum
of
impatience
you
would
be
wrong
to
exaggerate
such
notions
as
those
monsieur
said
the
superintendent
for
a
man
s
mind
is
variable
and
full
of
these
very
excusable
caprices
which
are
however
sometimes
estimable
enough
and
a
man
may
have
wished
for
something
yesterday
of
which
he
repents
vanel
felt
a
cold
sweat
trickle
down
his
face
monseigneur
he
muttered
aramis
who
was
delighted
to
find
the
superintendent
carry
on
the
debate
with
such
clearness
and
precision
stood
leaning
his
arm
upon
the
marble
top
of
a
console
table
and
began
to
play
with
a
small
gold
knife
with
a
malachite
handle
fouquet
did
not
hasten
to
reply
but
after
a
moment
s
pause
come
my
dear
monsieur
vanel
he
said
i
will
explain
to
you
how
i
am
vanel
began
to
tremble
yesterday
i
wished
to
sell
monseigneur
did
more
than
wish
to
sell
he
actually
well
well
that
may
be
so
but
i
ask
you
the
favor
to
restore
me
my
word
which
i
pledged
i
received
your
as
a
satisfactory
assurance
that
it
would
be
i
know
that
and
that
is
the
reason
why
i
now
entreat
you
do
you
understand
me
i
entreat
you
to
restore
it
to
fouquet
suddenly
paused
the
words
i
entreat
you
the
effect
of
which
he
did
not
immediately
perceive
seemed
almost
to
choke
him
as
he
uttered
it
aramis
still
playing
with
his
knife
fixed
a
look
upon
vanel
which
seemed
as
if
he
wished
to
penetrate
the
recesses
of
his
heart
vanel
simply
bowed
as
he
said
i
am
overcome
monseigneur
at
the
honor
you
do
me
to
consult
me
upon
a
matter
of
business
which
is
already
completed
but
nay
do
not
say
dear
monsieur
alas
monseigneur
you
see
he
said
as
he
opened
a
large
i
have
brought
the
money
with
me
the
whole
sum
i
mean
and
here
monseigneur
is
the
contract
of
sale
which
i
have
just
effected
of
a
property
belonging
to
my
wife
the
order
is
authentic
in
every
particular
the
necessary
signatures
have
been
attached
to
it
and
it
is
made
payable
at
sight
it
is
ready
money
in
fact
and
in
one
word
the
whole
affair
is
my
dear
monsieur
vanel
there
is
not
a
matter
of
business
in
this
world
however
important
it
may
be
which
can
not
be
postponed
in
order
to
oblige
a
man
who
by
that
means
might
and
would
be
made
a
devoted
certainly
said
vanel
awkwardly
and
much
more
justly
acquired
would
that
friend
become
monsieur
vanel
since
the
value
of
the
service
he
had
received
would
have
been
so
considerable
well
what
do
you
say
what
do
you
decide
vanel
preserved
a
perfect
silence
in
the
meantime
aramis
had
continued
his
close
observation
of
the
man
vanel
s
narrow
face
his
deeply
sunken
eyes
his
arched
eyebrows
had
revealed
to
the
bishop
of
vannes
the
type
of
an
avaricious
and
ambitious
character
aramis
s
method
was
to
oppose
one
passion
by
another
he
saw
that
fouquet
was
defeated
morally
subdued
and
so
he
came
to
his
rescue
with
fresh
weapons
in
his
hands
excuse
me
monseigneur
he
said
you
forgot
to
show
vanel
that
his
own
interests
are
diametrically
opposed
to
this
renunciation
of
the
vanel
looked
at
the
bishop
with
astonishment
he
had
hardly
expected
to
find
an
auxiliary
in
him
fouquet
also
paused
to
listen
to
the
bishop
do
you
not
see
continued
aramis
that
vanel
in
order
to
purchase
your
appointment
has
been
obliged
to
sell
a
property
belonging
to
his
wife
well
that
is
no
slight
matter
for
one
can
not
displace
as
he
has
done
fourteen
or
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
without
some
considerable
loss
and
very
serious
perfectly
true
said
vanel
whose
secret
aramis
had
with
gaze
wrung
from
the
bottom
of
his
heart
inconveniences
such
as
these
are
matters
of
great
expense
and
calculation
and
whenever
a
man
has
money
matters
to
deal
with
the
expenses
are
generally
the
very
first
thing
thought
yes
yes
said
fouquet
who
began
to
understand
aramis
s
meaning
vanel
remained
perfectly
silent
he
too
had
understood
him
aramis
observed
his
coldness
of
manner
and
his
silence
very
good
he
said
to
himself
you
are
waiting
i
see
until
you
know
the
amount
but
do
not
fear
i
shall
send
you
such
a
flight
of
crowns
that
you
can
not
but
capitulate
on
the
we
must
offer
vanel
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
at
once
said
fouquet
carried
away
by
his
generous
feelings
the
sum
was
a
good
one
a
prince
even
would
have
been
satisfied
with
such
a
bonus
a
hundred
thousand
crowns
at
that
period
was
the
dowry
of
a
king
s
daughter
vanel
however
did
not
move
he
is
a
perfect
rascal
thought
the
bishop
well
we
must
offer
the
five
hundred
thousand
francs
at
once
and
he
made
a
sign
to
fouquet
accordingly
you
seem
to
have
spent
more
than
that
dear
monsieur
vanel
said
the
superintendent
the
price
of
ready
money
is
enormous
you
must
have
made
a
great
sacrifice
in
selling
your
wife
s
property
well
what
can
i
have
been
thinking
of
i
ought
to
have
offered
to
sign
you
an
order
for
five
hundred
thousand
francs
and
even
in
that
case
i
shall
feel
that
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
there
was
not
a
gleam
of
delight
or
desire
on
vanel
s
face
which
remained
perfectly
impassible
not
a
muscle
of
it
changed
in
the
slightest
degree
aramis
cast
a
look
almost
of
despair
at
fouquet
and
then
going
straight
up
to
vanel
and
taking
hold
of
him
by
the
coat
in
a
familiar
manner
he
said
monsieur
vanel
it
is
neither
the
inconvenience
nor
the
displacement
of
your
money
nor
the
sale
of
your
wife
s
property
even
that
you
are
thinking
of
at
this
moment
it
is
something
more
important
still
i
can
well
understand
it
so
pay
particular
attention
to
what
i
am
going
to
yes
monseigneur
vanel
replied
beginning
to
tremble
in
every
limb
as
the
prelate
s
eyes
seemed
almost
ready
to
devour
him
i
offer
you
therefore
in
the
superintendent
s
name
not
three
hundred
thousand
livres
nor
five
hundred
thousand
but
a
million
a
million
do
you
understand
me
he
added
as
he
shook
him
nervously
a
million
repeated
vanel
as
pale
as
death
a
million
in
other
words
at
the
present
rate
of
interest
an
income
of
seventy
thousand
come
monsieur
said
fouquet
you
can
hardly
refuse
that
answer
do
you
accept
impossible
murmured
vanel
aramis
bit
his
lips
and
something
like
a
cloud
seemed
to
pass
over
his
face
the
thunder
behind
this
cloud
could
easily
be
imagined
he
still
kept
his
hold
on
vanel
you
have
purchased
the
appointment
for
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
i
think
well
you
will
receive
these
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
back
again
by
paying
fouquet
a
visit
and
shaking
hands
with
him
on
the
bargain
you
will
have
become
a
gainer
of
a
million
and
a
half
you
get
honor
and
profit
at
the
same
time
monsieur
i
can
not
do
it
said
vanel
hoarsely
very
well
replied
aramis
who
had
grasped
vanel
so
tightly
by
the
coat
that
when
he
let
go
his
hold
vanel
staggered
back
a
few
paces
very
well
one
can
now
see
clearly
enough
your
object
in
coming
yes
said
fouquet
one
can
easily
see
but
said
vanel
attempting
to
stand
erect
before
the
weakness
of
these
two
men
of
honor
does
the
fellow
presume
to
speak
said
aramis
with
the
tone
of
an
emperor
fellow
repeated
vanel
the
scoundrel
i
meant
to
say
added
aramis
who
had
now
resumed
his
usual
come
monsieur
produce
your
deed
of
sale
you
have
it
about
you
i
suppose
in
one
of
your
pockets
already
prepared
as
an
assassin
holds
his
pistol
or
his
dagger
concealed
under
his
vanel
began
to
mutter
something
enough
cried
fouquet
where
is
this
deed
vanel
tremblingly
searched
in
his
pockets
and
as
he
drew
out
his
a
paper
fell
out
of
it
while
vanel
offered
the
other
to
fouquet
aramis
pounced
upon
the
paper
which
had
fallen
out
as
soon
as
he
recognized
the
handwriting
i
beg
your
pardon
said
vanel
that
is
a
rough
draft
of
the
i
see
that
very
clearly
retorted
aramis
with
a
smile
more
cutting
than
a
lash
of
a
whip
and
what
i
admire
most
is
that
this
draft
is
in
colbert
s
handwriting
look
monseigneur
and
he
handed
the
draft
to
fouquet
who
recognized
the
truth
of
the
fact
for
covered
with
erasures
with
inserted
words
the
margins
filled
with
additions
this
deed
a
living
proof
of
colbert
s
plot
had
just
revealed
everything
to
its
unhappy
victim
well
murmured
fouquet
vanel
completely
humiliated
seemed
as
if
he
were
looking
for
some
hole
wherein
to
hide
himself
well
said
aramis
if
your
name
were
not
fouquet
and
if
your
enemy
s
name
were
not
colbert
if
you
had
not
this
mean
thief
before
you
i
should
say
to
you
repudiate
it
such
a
proof
as
this
absolves
you
from
your
word
but
these
fellows
would
think
you
were
afraid
they
would
fear
you
less
than
they
do
therefore
sign
the
deed
at
and
he
held
out
a
pen
towards
him
fouquet
pressed
aramis
s
hand
but
instead
of
the
deed
which
vanel
handed
to
him
he
took
the
rough
draft
of
it
no
not
that
paper
said
aramis
hastily
this
is
the
one
the
other
is
too
precious
a
document
for
you
to
part
no
no
replied
fouquet
i
will
sign
under
colbert
s
own
handwriting
even
and
i
write
the
handwriting
is
approved
he
then
signed
and
said
here
it
is
monsieur
and
the
latter
seized
the
paper
dashed
down
the
money
and
was
about
to
make
his
escape
one
moment
said
aramis
are
you
quite
sure
the
exact
amount
is
there
it
ought
to
be
counted
over
monsieur
vanel
particularly
since
colbert
makes
presents
of
money
to
ladies
i
see
ah
that
worthy
colbert
is
not
so
generous
as
and
aramis
spelling
every
word
every
letter
of
the
order
to
pay
distilled
his
wrath
and
his
contempt
drop
by
drop
upon
the
miserable
wretch
who
had
to
submit
to
this
torture
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
was
then
dismissed
not
in
words
but
by
a
gesture
as
one
dismisses
or
discharges
a
beggar
or
a
menial
as
soon
as
vanel
had
gone
the
minister
and
the
prelate
their
eyes
fixed
on
each
other
remained
silent
for
a
few
moments
well
said
aramis
the
first
to
break
the
silence
to
what
can
that
man
be
compared
who
at
the
very
moment
he
is
on
the
point
of
entering
into
a
conflict
with
an
enemy
armed
from
head
to
foot
panting
for
his
life
presents
himself
for
the
contest
utterly
defenseless
throws
down
his
arms
and
smiles
and
kisses
his
hands
to
his
adversary
in
the
most
gracious
manner
good
faith
fouquet
is
a
weapon
which
scoundrels
frequently
make
use
of
against
men
of
honor
and
it
answers
their
purpose
men
of
honor
ought
in
their
turn
also
to
make
use
of
dishonest
means
against
such
scoundrels
you
would
soon
see
how
strong
they
would
become
without
ceasing
to
be
men
of
what
they
did
would
be
termed
the
acts
of
a
scoundrel
replied
fouquet
far
from
that
it
would
be
merely
coquetting
or
playing
with
the
truth
at
all
events
since
you
have
finished
with
this
vanel
since
you
have
deprived
yourself
of
the
happiness
of
confounding
him
by
repudiating
your
word
and
since
you
have
given
up
for
the
purpose
of
being
used
against
yourself
the
only
weapon
which
can
ruin
you
my
dear
friend
said
fouquet
mournfully
you
are
like
the
teacher
of
philosophy
whom
la
fontaine
was
telling
us
about
the
other
day
he
saw
a
child
drowning
and
began
to
read
him
a
lecture
divided
into
three
aramis
smiled
as
he
said
philosophy
yes
teacher
yes
a
drowning
child
yes
but
a
child
can
be
saved
you
shall
see
but
first
of
all
let
us
talk
about
business
did
you
not
some
time
ago
he
continued
as
fouquet
looked
at
him
with
a
bewildered
air
speak
to
me
about
an
idea
you
had
of
giving
a
at
vaux
oh
said
fouquet
that
was
when
affairs
were
a
i
believe
to
which
the
king
invited
himself
of
his
own
accord
no
no
my
dear
prelate
a
to
which
colbert
advised
the
king
to
invite
ah
exactly
as
it
would
be
a
of
so
costly
a
character
that
you
would
be
ruined
in
giving
precisely
so
in
happier
days
as
i
said
just
now
i
had
a
kind
of
pride
in
showing
my
enemies
how
inexhaustible
my
resources
were
i
felt
it
a
point
of
honor
to
strike
them
with
amazement
by
creating
millions
under
circumstances
where
they
imagined
nothing
but
bankruptcies
and
failures
would
follow
but
at
present
i
am
arranging
my
accounts
with
the
state
with
the
king
with
myself
and
i
must
now
become
a
mean
stingy
man
i
shall
be
able
to
prove
to
the
world
that
i
can
act
or
operate
with
my
deniers
as
i
used
to
do
with
my
bags
of
pistoles
and
from
my
equipages
shall
be
sold
my
mansions
mortgaged
my
expenses
from
interrupted
aramis
quietly
you
will
occupy
yourself
without
the
slightest
delay
with
your
at
vaux
which
must
hereafter
be
spoken
of
as
one
of
the
most
magnificent
productions
of
your
most
prosperous
are
you
mad
chevalier
d
herblay
i
do
you
think
so
what
do
you
mean
then
do
you
not
know
that
a
at
vaux
one
of
the
very
simplest
possible
character
would
cost
four
or
five
millions
i
do
not
speak
of
a
of
the
very
simplest
possible
character
my
dear
but
since
the
is
to
be
given
to
the
king
replied
fouquet
who
misunderstood
aramis
s
idea
it
can
not
be
just
so
it
ought
to
be
on
a
scale
of
the
most
unbounded
in
that
case
i
shall
have
to
spend
ten
or
twelve
you
shall
spend
twenty
if
you
require
it
said
aramis
in
a
perfectly
calm
voice
where
shall
i
get
them
exclaimed
fouquet
that
is
my
affair
monsieur
le
surintendant
and
do
not
be
uneasy
for
a
moment
about
it
the
money
shall
be
placed
at
once
at
your
disposal
the
moment
you
have
arranged
the
plans
of
your
chevalier
chevalier
said
fouquet
giddy
with
amazement
whither
are
you
hurrying
me
across
the
gulf
into
which
you
were
about
to
fall
replied
the
bishop
of
vannes
take
hold
of
my
cloak
and
throw
fear
why
did
you
not
tell
me
that
sooner
aramis
there
was
a
day
when
with
one
million
only
you
could
have
saved
me
whilst
whilst
i
can
give
you
twenty
said
the
prelate
such
is
the
case
however
the
reason
is
very
simple
on
the
day
you
speak
of
i
had
not
the
million
which
you
had
need
of
at
my
disposal
whilst
now
i
can
easily
procure
the
twenty
millions
we
may
heaven
hear
you
and
save
me
aramis
resumed
his
usual
smile
the
expression
of
which
was
so
singular
heaven
never
fails
to
hear
me
he
said
i
abandon
myself
to
you
unreservedly
fouquet
murmured
no
no
i
do
not
understand
it
in
that
manner
i
am
unreservedly
devoted
to
you
therefore
as
you
have
the
clearest
the
most
delicate
and
the
most
ingenious
mind
of
the
two
you
shall
have
entire
control
over
the
even
to
the
very
smallest
details
only
only
said
fouquet
as
a
man
accustomed
to
understand
and
appreciate
the
value
of
a
parenthesis
well
then
leaving
the
entire
invention
of
the
details
to
you
i
shall
reserve
to
myself
a
general
superintendence
over
the
in
what
way
i
mean
that
you
will
make
of
me
on
that
day
a
a
sort
of
or
factotum
something
between
a
captain
of
the
guard
and
manager
or
steward
i
will
look
after
the
people
and
will
keep
the
keys
of
the
doors
you
will
give
your
orders
of
course
but
will
give
them
to
no
one
but
me
they
will
pass
through
my
lips
to
reach
those
for
whom
they
are
intended
you
understand
no
i
am
very
far
from
but
you
agree
of
course
of
course
my
that
is
all
i
care
about
then
thanks
and
now
go
and
prepare
your
list
of
whom
shall
i
invite
everybody
you
chapter
l
in
which
the
author
thinks
it
is
high
time
to
return
to
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
our
readers
will
have
observed
in
this
story
the
adventures
of
the
new
and
of
the
past
generation
being
detailed
as
it
were
side
by
side
he
will
have
noticed
in
the
former
the
reflection
of
the
glory
of
earlier
years
the
experience
of
the
bitter
things
of
this
world
in
the
former
also
that
peace
which
takes
possession
of
the
heart
and
that
healing
of
the
scars
which
were
formerly
deep
and
painful
wounds
in
the
latter
the
conflicts
of
love
and
vanity
bitter
disappointments
ineffable
delights
life
instead
of
memory
if
therefore
any
variety
has
been
presented
to
the
reader
in
the
different
episodes
of
this
tale
it
is
to
be
attributed
to
the
numerous
shades
of
color
which
are
presented
on
this
double
tablet
where
two
pictures
are
seen
side
by
side
mingling
and
harmonizing
their
severe
and
pleasing
tones
the
repose
of
the
emotions
of
one
is
found
in
harmonious
contrast
with
the
fiery
sentiments
of
the
other
after
having
talked
reason
with
older
heads
one
loves
to
talk
nonsense
with
youth
therefore
if
the
threads
of
the
story
do
not
seem
very
intimately
to
connect
the
chapter
we
are
now
writing
with
the
one
we
have
just
written
we
do
not
intend
to
give
ourselves
any
more
thought
or
trouble
about
it
than
ruysdael
took
in
painting
an
autumn
sky
after
having
finished
a
scene
we
accordingly
resume
raoul
de
bragelonne
s
story
at
the
very
place
where
our
last
sketch
left
him
in
a
state
of
frenzy
and
dismay
or
rather
without
power
or
will
of
his
own
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
he
fled
swiftly
after
the
scene
in
la
valliere
s
chamber
that
strange
exclusion
louise
s
grief
montalais
s
terror
the
king
s
wrath
all
seemed
to
indicate
some
misfortune
but
what
he
had
arrived
from
london
because
he
had
been
told
of
the
existence
of
a
danger
and
almost
on
his
arrival
this
appearance
of
danger
was
manifest
was
not
this
sufficient
for
a
lover
certainly
it
was
but
it
was
insufficient
for
a
pure
and
upright
heart
such
as
his
and
yet
raoul
did
not
seek
for
explanations
in
the
very
quarter
where
more
jealous
or
less
timid
lovers
would
have
done
he
did
not
go
straightaway
to
his
mistress
and
say
louise
is
it
true
that
you
love
me
no
longer
is
it
true
that
you
love
another
full
of
courage
full
of
friendship
as
he
was
full
of
love
a
religious
observer
of
his
word
and
believing
blindly
the
word
of
others
raoul
said
within
himself
guiche
wrote
to
put
me
on
my
guard
guiche
knows
something
i
will
go
and
ask
guiche
what
he
knows
and
tell
him
what
i
have
the
journey
was
not
a
long
one
guiche
who
had
been
brought
from
fontainebleau
to
paris
within
the
last
two
days
was
beginning
to
recover
from
his
wounds
and
to
walk
about
a
little
in
his
room
he
uttered
a
cry
of
joy
as
he
saw
raoul
with
the
eagerness
of
friendship
enter
the
apartment
raoul
was
unable
to
refrain
from
a
cry
of
grief
when
he
saw
de
guiche
so
pale
so
thin
so
melancholy
a
very
few
words
and
a
simple
gesture
which
de
guiche
made
to
put
aside
raoul
s
arm
were
sufficient
to
inform
the
latter
of
the
truth
ah
so
it
is
said
raoul
seating
himself
beside
his
friend
one
loves
and
no
no
not
dies
replied
guiche
smiling
since
i
am
now
recovering
and
since
too
i
can
press
you
in
my
ah
i
and
i
understand
you
too
you
fancy
i
am
unhappy
raoul
alas
no
i
am
the
happiest
of
men
my
body
suffers
but
not
my
mind
or
my
heart
if
you
only
knew
oh
i
am
indeed
the
very
happiest
of
so
much
the
better
said
raoul
so
much
the
better
provided
it
it
is
over
i
have
had
enough
happiness
to
last
me
to
my
dying
day
i
have
no
doubt
you
have
had
but
she
listen
i
love
her
because
but
you
are
not
listening
to
i
beg
your
your
mind
is
yes
your
health
in
the
first
place
it
is
not
that
i
my
dear
friend
you
would
be
wrong
i
think
to
ask
me
any
questions
of
all
persons
in
the
world
and
he
laid
so
much
weight
upon
the
you
that
he
completely
enlightened
his
friend
upon
the
nature
of
the
evil
and
the
difficulty
of
remedying
it
you
say
that
raoul
on
account
of
what
i
wrote
to
certainly
we
will
talk
over
that
matter
a
little
when
you
have
finished
telling
me
of
all
your
own
pleasures
and
your
my
dear
friend
i
am
entirely
at
your
thank
you
i
have
hurried
i
have
flown
here
i
came
in
half
the
time
the
government
couriers
usually
take
now
tell
me
my
dear
friend
what
did
you
want
nothing
whatever
but
to
make
you
well
then
i
am
all
is
quite
right
there
must
have
been
something
else
i
suppose
no
de
guiche
upon
my
honor
you
can
not
possibly
have
crushed
all
my
hopes
so
violently
or
have
exposed
me
to
being
disgraced
by
the
king
for
my
return
which
is
in
disobedience
of
his
orders
you
can
not
i
say
have
planted
jealousy
in
my
heart
merely
to
say
to
me
it
is
all
right
be
perfectly
i
do
not
say
to
you
raoul
be
perfectly
easy
but
pray
understand
me
i
never
will
nor
can
i
indeed
tell
you
anything
what
sort
of
person
do
you
take
me
for
what
do
you
mean
if
you
know
anything
why
conceal
it
from
me
if
you
do
not
know
anything
why
did
you
write
so
warningly
true
true
i
was
very
wrong
and
i
regret
having
done
so
raoul
it
seems
nothing
to
write
to
a
friend
and
say
come
but
to
have
this
friend
face
to
face
to
feel
him
tremble
and
breathlessly
and
anxiously
wait
to
hear
what
one
hardly
dare
tell
him
is
very
dare
i
have
courage
enough
if
you
have
not
exclaimed
raoul
in
despair
see
how
unjust
you
are
and
how
soon
you
forget
you
have
to
do
with
a
poor
wounded
fellow
such
as
your
unhappy
friend
is
so
calm
yourself
raoul
i
said
to
you
come
you
are
here
so
ask
me
nothing
your
object
in
telling
me
to
come
was
your
hope
that
i
should
see
with
my
own
eyes
was
it
not
nay
do
not
hesitate
for
i
have
seen
oh
exclaimed
de
guiche
or
at
least
i
thought
there
now
you
see
you
are
not
sure
but
if
you
have
any
doubt
my
poor
friend
what
remains
for
me
to
do
i
saw
louise
much
agitated
montalais
in
a
state
of
bewilderment
the
king
the
king
yes
you
turn
your
head
aside
the
danger
is
there
the
evil
is
there
tell
me
is
it
not
so
is
it
not
the
king
i
say
oh
you
say
a
thousand
times
more
than
nothing
give
me
facts
for
pity
s
sake
give
me
proofs
my
friend
the
only
friend
i
have
speak
tell
me
all
my
heart
is
crushed
wounded
to
death
i
am
dying
from
if
that
really
be
so
as
i
see
it
is
indeed
dear
raoul
replied
de
guiche
you
relieve
me
from
my
difficulty
and
i
will
tell
you
all
perfectly
sure
that
i
can
tell
you
nothing
but
what
is
consoling
compared
to
the
despair
from
which
i
see
you
go
on
go
on
i
am
well
then
i
can
only
tell
you
what
you
might
learn
from
every
one
you
from
every
one
do
you
say
it
is
talked
about
then
before
you
say
people
talk
about
it
learn
what
it
is
that
people
have
to
talk
about
i
assure
you
solemnly
that
people
only
talk
about
what
may
in
truth
be
very
innocent
perhaps
a
walk
ah
a
walk
with
the
king
yes
certainly
a
walk
with
the
king
and
i
believe
the
king
has
already
very
frequently
before
taken
walks
with
ladies
without
on
that
account
you
would
not
have
written
to
me
shall
i
say
again
if
there
had
been
nothing
unusual
in
this
i
know
that
while
the
storm
lasted
it
would
have
been
far
better
if
the
king
had
taken
shelter
somewhere
else
than
to
have
remained
with
his
head
uncovered
before
la
valliere
but
the
king
is
so
very
courteous
and
oh
de
guiche
de
guiche
you
are
killing
me
do
not
let
us
talk
any
more
nay
let
us
continue
this
walk
was
followed
by
others
i
suppose
no
i
mean
yes
there
was
the
adventure
of
the
oak
i
think
but
i
know
nothing
about
the
matter
at
raoul
rose
de
guiche
endeavored
to
imitate
him
notwithstanding
his
weakness
well
i
will
not
add
another
word
i
have
said
either
too
much
or
not
enough
let
others
give
you
further
information
if
they
will
or
if
they
can
my
duty
was
to
warn
you
and
i
have
done
watch
over
your
own
affairs
now
question
others
alas
you
are
no
true
friend
to
speak
to
me
in
that
manner
said
the
young
man
in
utter
distress
the
first
man
i
meet
may
be
either
evilly
disposed
or
a
fool
if
the
former
he
will
tell
me
a
lie
to
make
me
suffer
more
than
i
do
now
if
the
latter
he
will
do
worse
still
ah
de
guiche
de
guiche
before
two
hours
are
over
i
shall
have
been
told
ten
falsehoods
and
shall
have
as
many
duels
on
my
hands
save
me
then
is
it
not
best
to
know
the
worst
always
but
i
know
nothing
i
tell
you
i
was
wounded
attacked
by
fever
out
of
my
senses
and
i
have
only
a
very
faint
recollection
of
it
all
but
there
is
no
reason
why
we
should
search
very
far
when
the
very
man
we
want
is
close
at
hand
is
not
d
artagnan
your
friend
oh
true
true
got
to
him
then
he
will
be
able
to
throw
sufficient
light
upon
the
at
this
moment
a
lackey
entered
the
room
what
is
it
said
de
guiche
some
one
is
waiting
for
monseigneur
in
the
cabinet
des
very
well
will
you
excuse
me
my
dear
raoul
i
am
so
proud
since
i
have
been
able
to
walk
i
would
offer
you
my
arm
de
guiche
if
i
did
not
guess
that
the
person
in
question
is
a
i
believe
so
said
de
guiche
smiling
as
he
quitted
raoul
raoul
remained
motionless
absorbed
in
grief
overwhelmed
like
the
miner
upon
whom
a
vault
has
just
fallen
in
who
wounded
his
welling
fast
his
thoughts
confused
endeavors
to
recover
himself
to
save
his
life
and
to
retain
his
reason
a
few
minutes
were
all
raoul
needed
to
dissipate
the
bewildering
sensations
occasioned
by
these
two
revelations
he
had
already
recovered
the
thread
of
his
ideas
when
suddenly
through
the
door
he
fancied
he
recognized
montalais
s
voice
in
the
cabinet
des
porcelaines
she
he
cried
yes
it
is
indeed
her
voice
she
will
be
able
to
tell
me
the
whole
truth
but
shall
i
question
her
here
she
conceals
herself
even
from
me
she
is
coming
no
doubt
from
madame
i
will
see
her
in
her
own
apartment
she
will
explain
her
alarm
her
flight
the
strange
manner
in
which
i
was
driven
out
she
will
tell
me
all
that
after
d
artagnan
who
knows
everything
shall
have
given
me
a
fresh
strength
and
courage
madame
a
coquette
i
fear
and
yet
a
coquette
who
is
herself
in
love
has
her
moments
of
kindness
a
coquette
who
is
as
capricious
and
uncertain
as
life
or
death
but
who
tells
de
guiche
that
he
is
the
happiest
of
men
he
at
least
is
lying
on
and
so
he
hastily
quitted
the
comte
s
apartments
reproaching
himself
as
he
went
for
having
talked
of
nothing
but
his
own
affairs
to
de
guiche
and
soon
reached
d
artagnan
s
quarters
chapter
li
bragelonne
continues
his
inquiries
the
captain
sitting
buried
in
his
leathern
armchair
his
spurs
fixed
in
the
floor
his
sword
between
his
legs
was
reading
a
number
of
letters
as
he
twisted
his
mustache
d
artagnan
uttered
a
welcome
full
of
pleasure
when
he
perceived
his
friend
s
son
raoul
my
boy
he
said
by
what
lucky
accident
does
it
happen
that
the
king
has
recalled
you
these
words
did
not
sound
agreeably
in
the
young
man
s
ears
who
as
he
seated
himself
replied
upon
my
word
i
can
not
tell
you
all
that
i
know
is
i
have
come
hum
said
d
artagnan
folding
up
his
letters
and
directing
a
look
full
of
meaning
at
him
what
do
you
say
my
boy
that
the
king
has
not
recalled
you
and
you
have
returned
i
do
not
understand
that
at
raoul
was
already
pale
enough
and
he
now
began
to
turn
his
hat
round
and
round
in
his
hand
what
the
deuce
is
the
matter
that
you
look
as
you
do
and
what
makes
you
so
dumb
said
the
captain
do
people
nowadays
assume
that
sort
of
airs
in
england
i
have
been
in
england
and
came
here
again
as
lively
as
a
chaffinch
will
you
not
say
something
i
have
too
much
to
ah
how
is
your
father
forgive
me
my
dear
friend
i
was
going
to
ask
you
d
artagnan
increased
the
sharpness
of
his
penetrating
gaze
which
no
secret
was
capable
of
resisting
you
are
unhappy
about
something
he
said
i
am
indeed
and
you
know
the
reason
very
well
monsieur
d
i
of
course
nay
do
not
pretend
to
be
i
am
not
pretending
to
be
astonished
my
dear
captain
i
know
very
well
that
in
all
trials
of
as
well
as
in
all
trials
of
strength
i
shall
be
beaten
by
you
you
can
see
that
at
the
present
moment
i
am
an
idiot
an
absolute
noodle
i
have
neither
head
nor
arm
do
not
despise
but
help
me
in
two
words
i
am
the
most
wretched
of
living
oh
oh
why
that
inquired
d
artagnan
unbuckling
his
belt
and
thawing
the
asperity
of
his
smile
because
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
is
deceiving
she
is
deceiving
you
said
d
artagnan
not
a
muscle
of
whose
face
had
moved
those
are
big
words
who
makes
use
of
them
every
ah
if
every
one
says
so
there
must
be
some
truth
in
it
i
begin
to
believe
there
is
fire
when
i
see
smoke
it
is
ridiculous
perhaps
but
it
is
therefore
you
believe
me
exclaimed
bragelonne
quickly
i
never
mix
myself
up
in
affairs
of
that
kind
you
know
that
very
what
not
for
a
friend
for
a
son
exactly
if
you
were
a
stranger
i
should
tell
you
i
will
tell
nothing
at
all
how
is
porthos
do
you
know
monsieur
cried
raoul
pressing
d
artagnan
s
hand
i
entreat
you
in
the
name
of
the
friendship
you
vowed
my
father
the
deuce
take
it
you
are
really
ill
from
no
it
is
not
from
curiosity
it
is
from
good
another
big
word
if
you
were
really
in
love
my
dear
raoul
you
would
be
very
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
if
you
were
really
so
deeply
in
love
that
i
could
believe
i
was
addressing
myself
to
your
heart
but
it
is
i
tell
you
i
love
louise
to
d
artagnan
could
read
to
the
very
bottom
of
the
young
man
s
heart
impossible
i
tell
you
he
said
you
are
like
all
young
men
you
are
not
in
love
you
are
out
of
your
well
suppose
it
were
only
that
no
sensible
man
ever
succeeded
in
making
much
of
a
brain
when
the
head
was
turned
i
have
completely
lost
my
senses
in
the
same
way
a
hundred
times
in
my
life
you
would
listen
to
me
but
you
would
not
hear
me
you
would
hear
but
you
would
not
understand
me
you
would
understand
but
you
would
not
obey
oh
try
i
go
far
even
if
i
were
unfortunate
enough
to
know
something
and
foolish
enough
to
communicate
it
to
you
you
are
my
friend
you
say
indeed
very
good
i
should
quarrel
with
you
you
would
never
forgive
me
for
having
destroyed
your
illusion
as
people
say
in
love
monsieur
d
artagnan
you
know
all
and
yet
you
plunge
me
in
perplexity
and
despair
in
death
there
there
i
never
complain
as
you
know
but
as
heaven
and
my
father
would
never
forgive
me
for
blowing
out
my
brains
i
will
go
and
get
the
first
person
i
meet
to
give
me
the
information
which
you
withhold
i
will
tell
him
he
lies
and
and
you
would
kill
him
and
a
fine
affair
that
would
be
so
much
the
better
what
should
i
care
kill
any
one
you
please
my
boy
if
it
gives
you
any
pleasure
it
is
exactly
like
a
man
with
a
toothache
who
keeps
on
saying
oh
what
torture
i
am
suffering
i
could
bite
a
piece
of
iron
in
my
answer
always
is
bite
my
friend
bite
the
tooth
will
remain
all
the
i
shall
not
kill
any
one
monsieur
said
raoul
gloomily
yes
yes
you
now
assume
a
different
tone
instead
of
killing
you
will
get
killed
yourself
i
suppose
you
mean
very
fine
indeed
how
much
i
should
regret
you
of
course
i
should
go
about
all
day
saying
ah
what
a
fine
stupid
fellow
that
bragelonne
was
as
great
a
stupid
as
i
ever
met
with
i
have
passed
my
whole
life
almost
in
teaching
him
how
to
hold
and
use
his
sword
properly
and
the
silly
fellow
has
got
himself
spitted
like
a
go
then
raoul
go
and
get
yourself
disposed
of
if
you
like
i
hardly
know
who
can
have
taught
you
logic
but
deuce
take
me
if
your
father
has
not
been
regularly
robbed
of
his
raoul
buried
his
face
in
his
hands
murmuring
no
no
i
have
not
a
single
friend
in
the
oh
bah
said
d
artagnan
i
meet
with
nothing
but
raillery
or
idle
fancies
monsieur
i
do
not
laugh
at
you
although
i
am
a
gascon
and
as
for
being
indifferent
if
i
were
so
i
should
have
sent
you
about
your
business
a
quarter
of
an
hour
ago
for
you
would
make
a
man
who
was
out
of
his
senses
with
delight
as
dull
as
possible
and
would
be
the
death
of
one
who
was
out
of
spirits
how
now
young
man
do
you
wish
me
to
disgust
you
with
the
girl
you
are
attached
to
and
to
teach
you
to
execrate
the
whole
sex
who
constitute
the
honor
and
happiness
of
human
life
oh
tell
me
monsieur
and
i
will
bless
do
you
think
my
dear
fellow
that
i
can
have
crammed
into
my
brain
all
about
the
carpenter
and
the
painter
and
the
staircase
and
a
hundred
other
similar
tales
of
the
same
kind
a
carpenter
what
do
you
mean
upon
my
word
i
don
t
know
some
one
told
me
there
was
a
carpenter
who
made
an
opening
through
a
certain
in
la
valliere
s
room
oh
i
don
t
know
in
the
king
s
apartment
perhaps
of
course
if
it
were
in
the
king
s
apartment
i
should
tell
you
i
in
whose
room
then
i
have
told
you
for
the
last
hour
that
i
know
nothing
of
the
whole
but
the
painter
then
the
portrait
it
seems
that
the
king
wished
to
have
the
portrait
of
one
of
the
ladies
belonging
to
the
la
valliere
why
you
seem
to
have
only
that
name
in
your
mouth
who
spoke
to
you
of
la
valliere
if
it
be
not
her
portrait
then
why
do
you
suppose
it
would
concern
me
i
do
not
suppose
it
will
concern
you
but
you
ask
me
all
sorts
of
questions
and
i
answer
you
you
positively
will
learn
all
the
scandal
of
the
affair
and
i
tell
you
make
the
best
you
can
of
raoul
struck
his
forehead
with
his
hand
in
utter
despair
it
will
kill
me
he
said
so
you
have
said
yes
you
are
right
and
he
made
a
step
or
two
as
if
he
were
going
to
leave
where
are
you
going
to
look
for
some
one
who
will
tell
me
the
who
is
that
a
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
herself
i
suppose
you
mean
said
d
artagnan
with
a
smile
ah
a
famous
idea
that
you
wish
to
be
consoled
by
some
one
and
you
will
be
so
at
once
she
will
tell
you
nothing
ill
of
herself
of
course
so
be
you
are
mistaken
monsieur
replied
raoul
the
woman
i
mean
will
tell
me
all
the
evil
she
possibly
you
allude
to
montalais
i
suppose
her
friend
a
woman
who
on
that
account
will
exaggerate
all
that
is
either
bad
or
good
in
the
matter
do
not
talk
to
montalais
my
good
you
have
some
reasons
for
wishing
me
not
to
talk
with
montalais
well
i
admit
it
and
in
point
of
fact
why
should
i
play
with
you
as
a
cat
does
with
a
poor
mouse
you
distress
me
you
do
indeed
and
if
i
wish
you
not
to
speak
to
montalais
just
now
it
is
because
you
will
be
betraying
your
secret
and
people
will
take
advantage
of
it
wait
if
you
i
can
not
so
much
the
worse
why
you
see
raoul
if
i
had
an
idea
but
i
have
not
got
promise
me
that
you
will
pity
me
my
friend
that
is
all
i
need
and
leave
me
to
get
out
of
the
affair
by
oh
yes
indeed
in
order
that
you
may
get
deeper
into
the
mire
a
capital
idea
truly
go
and
sit
down
at
that
table
and
take
a
pen
in
your
what
for
to
write
and
ask
montalais
to
give
you
an
ah
said
raoul
snatching
eagerly
at
the
pen
which
the
captain
held
out
to
him
suddenly
the
door
opened
and
one
of
the
musketeers
approaching
d
artagnan
said
captain
mademoiselle
de
montalais
is
here
and
wishes
to
speak
to
to
me
murmured
d
artagnan
ask
her
to
come
in
i
shall
soon
see
he
said
to
himself
whether
she
wishes
to
speak
to
me
or
the
cunning
captain
was
quite
right
in
his
suspicions
for
as
soon
as
montalais
entered
she
exclaimed
oh
monsieur
monsieur
i
beg
your
pardon
monsieur
d
oh
i
forgive
you
mademoiselle
said
d
artagnan
i
know
that
at
my
age
those
who
are
looking
for
me
generally
need
me
for
something
or
i
was
looking
for
de
bragelonne
replied
montalais
how
very
fortunate
that
is
he
was
looking
for
you
too
raoul
will
you
accompany
mademoiselle
de
montalais
oh
go
along
then
he
said
as
he
gently
pushed
raoul
out
of
the
cabinet
and
then
taking
hold
of
montalais
s
hand
he
said
in
a
low
voice
be
kind
towards
him
spare
him
and
spare
her
too
if
you
ah
she
said
in
the
same
tone
of
voice
it
is
not
i
who
am
going
to
speak
to
who
then
it
is
madame
who
has
sent
for
very
good
cried
d
artagnan
it
is
madame
is
it
in
an
hour
s
time
then
the
poor
fellow
will
be
or
else
dead
said
montalais
in
a
voice
full
of
compassion
adieu
monsieur
d
artagnan
she
said
and
she
ran
to
join
raoul
who
was
waiting
for
her
at
a
little
distance
from
the
door
very
much
puzzled
and
thoroughly
uneasy
at
the
dialogue
which
promised
no
good
augury
for
him

their
affection
raoul
no
sooner
found
himself
alone
with
montalais
than
he
kissed
her
hand
with
rapture
there
there
said
the
young
girl
sadly
you

throwing
your
kisses

that
they
will
not
bring
you

and
tried
to
assume
the
look
and

is

introduced
well
he
thought
this
day
will
pass
away
without
my
learning
anything
guiche
showed
too
much
consideration
for
my
feelings
he
had
no
doubt
come
to
an
understanding
with
madame
and
both
of
them
by
a
friendly
plot
agreed
to
postpone
the
solution
of
the
problem
why
have
i
not
a
determined
inveterate
enemy
that
serpent
de
wardes
for
instance
that
he
would
bite
is
very
likely
but
i
should
not
hesitate
any
more
to
hesitate
to
doubt
better
far
to
the
next
moment
raoul
was
in
madame
s
presence
henrietta
more
charming
than
ever
was
half
lying
half
reclining
in
her
armchair
her
small
feet
upon
an
embroidered
velvet
cushion
she
was
playing
with
a
kitten
with
long
silky
fur
which
was
biting
her
fingers
and
hanging
by
the
lace
of
her
collar
madame
seemed
plunged
in
deep
thought
so
deep
indeed
that
it
required
both
montalais
and
raoul
s
voice
to
disturb
her
from
her
reverie
your
highness
sent
for
me
repeated
raoul
madame
shook
her
head
as
if
she
were
just
awakening
and
then
said
good
morning
monsieur
de
bragelonne
yes
i
sent
for
you
so
you
have
returned
from
england
yes
madame
and
am
at
your
royal
highness
s
thank
you
leave
us
montalais
and
the
latter
immediately
left
the
room
you
have
a
few
minutes
to
give
me
monsieur
de
bragelonne
have
you
not
my
life
is
at
your
royal
highness
s
disposal
raoul
returned
with
respect
guessing
that
there
was
something
serious
in
these
unusual
courtesies
nor
was
he
displeased
indeed
to
observe
the
seriousness
of
her
manner
feeling
persuaded
that
there
was
some
sort
of
affinity
between
madame
s
sentiments
and
his
own
in
fact
every
one
at
court
of
any
perception
at
all
knew
perfectly
well
the
capricious
fancy
and
absurd
despotism
of
the
princess
s
singular
character
madame
had
been
flattered
beyond
all
bounds
by
the
king
s
attention
she
had
made
herself
talked
about
she
had
inspired
the
queen
with
that
mortal
jealousy
which
is
the
stinging
scorpion
at
the
heel
of
every
woman
s
happiness
madame
in
a
word
in
her
attempts
to
cure
a
wounded
pride
found
that
her
heart
had
become
deeply
and
passionately
attached
we
know
what
madame
had
done
to
recall
raoul
who
had
been
sent
out
of
the
way
by
louis
xiv
raoul
did
not
know
of
her
letter
to
charles
although
d
artagnan
had
guessed
its
contents
who
will
undertake
to
account
for
that
seemingly
inexplicable
mixture
of
love
and
vanity
that
passionate
tenderness
of
feeling
that
prodigious
duplicity
of
conduct
no
one
can
indeed
not
even
the
bad
angel
who
kindles
the
love
of
coquetry
in
the
heart
of
a
woman
monsieur
de
bragelonne
said
the
princess
after
a
moment
s
pause
have
you
returned
satisfied
bragelonne
looked
at
madame
henrietta
and
seeing
how
pale
she
was
not
alone
from
what
she
was
keeping
back
but
also
from
what
she
was
burning
to
say
said
satisfied
what
is
there
for
me
to
be
satisfied
or
dissatisfied
about
madame
but
what
are
those
things
with
which
a
man
of
your
age
and
of
your
appearance
is
usually
either
satisfied
or
dissatisfied
how
eager
she
is
thought
raoul
almost
terrified
what
venom
is
it
she
is
going
to
distil
into
my
heart
and
then
frightened
at
what
she
might
possibly
be
going
to
tell
him
and
wishing
to
put
off
the
opportunity
of
having
everything
explained
which
he
had
hitherto
so
ardently
wished
for
yet
had
dreaded
so
much
he
replied
i
left
madame
a
dear
friend
in
good
health
and
on
my
return
i
find
him
very
you
refer
to
de
guiche
replied
madame
henrietta
with
imperturbable
i
heard
he
is
a
very
dear
friend
of
he
is
indeed
well
it
is
quite
true
he
has
been
wounded
but
he
is
better
now
oh
de
guiche
is
not
to
be
pitied
she
said
hurriedly
and
then
recovering
herself
added
but
has
he
anything
to
complain
of
has
he
complained
of
anything
is
there
any
cause
of
grief
or
sorrow
that
we
are
not
acquainted
with
i
allude
only
to
his
wound
so
much
the
better
then
for
in
other
respects
de
guiche
seems
to
be
very
happy
he
is
always
in
very
high
spirits
i
am
sure
that
you
monsieur
de
bragelonne
would
far
prefer
to
be
like
him
wounded
only
in
the
body
for
what
in
deed
is
such
a
wound
after
all
raoul
started
alas
he
said
to
himself
she
is
returning
to
what
did
you
say
she
inquired
i
did
not
say
anything
you
did
not
say
anything
you
disapprove
of
my
observation
then
you
are
perfectly
satisfied
i
suppose
raoul
approached
closer
to
her
madame
he
said
your
royal
highness
wishes
to
say
something
to
me
and
your
instinctive
kindness
and
generosity
of
disposition
induce
you
to
be
careful
and
considerate
as
to
your
manner
of
conveying
it
will
your
royal
highness
throw
this
kind
forbearance
aside
i
am
able
to
bear
everything
and
i
am
ah
replied
henrietta
what
do
you
understand
then
that
which
your
royal
highness
wishes
me
to
understand
said
raoul
trembling
notwithstanding
his
command
over
himself
as
he
pronounced
these
words
in
point
of
fact
murmured
the
princess
it
seems
cruel
but
since
i
have
begun
yes
madame
once
your
highness
has
deigned
to
begin
will
you
condescend
to
finish
henrietta
rose
hurriedly
and
walked
a
few
paces
up
and
down
her
room
what
did
de
guiche
tell
you
she
said
suddenly
nothing
nothing
did
he
say
nothing
ah
how
well
i
recognize
him
in
no
doubt
he
wished
to
spare
and
that
is
what
friends
call
friendship
but
surely
d
artagnan
whom
you
have
just
left
must
have
told
no
more
than
de
guiche
henrietta
made
a
gesture
full
of
impatience
as
she
said
at
least
you
know
all
the
court
i
know
nothing
at
all
not
the
scene
in
the
storm
no
not
the
in
the
forest
no
nor
the
flight
to
chaillot
raoul
whose
head
dropped
like
a
blossom
cut
down
by
the
reaper
made
an
almost
superhuman
effort
to
smile
as
he
replied
with
the
greatest
gentleness
i
have
had
the
honor
of
telling
your
royal
highness
that
i
am
absolutely
ignorant
of
everything
that
i
am
a
poor
unremembered
outcast
who
has
this
moment
arrived
from
england
there
have
rolled
so
many
stormy
waves
between
myself
and
those
i
left
behind
me
here
that
the
rumor
of
none
of
the
circumstances
your
highness
refers
to
has
been
able
to
reach
henrietta
was
affected
by
his
extreme
pallor
his
gentleness
and
his
great
courage
the
principal
feeling
in
her
heart
at
that
moment
was
an
eager
desire
to
hear
the
nature
of
the
remembrance
which
the
poor
lover
retained
of
the
woman
who
had
made
him
suffer
so
much
monsieur
de
bragelonne
she
said
that
which
your
friends
have
refused
to
do
i
will
do
for
you
whom
i
like
and
esteem
very
much
i
will
be
your
friend
on
this
occasion
you
hold
your
head
high
as
a
man
of
honor
should
and
i
deeply
regret
that
you
may
have
to
bow
before
ridicule
and
in
a
few
days
it
might
be
ah
exclaimed
raoul
perfectly
livid
it
is
as
bad
as
that
then
if
you
do
not
know
said
the
princess
i
see
that
you
guess
you
were
affianced
i
believe
to
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
yes
by
that
right
you
deserve
to
be
warned
about
her
as
some
day
or
another
i
shall
be
obliged
to
dismiss
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
from
my
service
dismiss
la
valliere
cried
bragelonne
of
course
do
you
suppose
i
shall
always
be
amenable
to
the
tears
and
protestations
of
the
king
no
no
my
house
shall
no
longer
be
made
a
convenience
for
such
practices
but
you
tremble
you
can
not
stand
no
madame
no
said
bragelonne
making
an
effort
over
himself
i
thought
i
should
have
died
just
now
that
was
all
your
royal
highness
did
me
the
honor
to
say
that
the
king
wept
and
implored
you
yes
but
in
vain
returned
the
princess
who
then
related
to
raoul
the
scene
that
took
place
at
chaillot
and
the
king
s
despair
on
his
return
she
told
him
of
his
indulgence
to
herself
and
the
terrible
word
with
which
the
outraged
princess
the
humiliated
coquette
had
quashed
the
royal
anger
raoul
stood
with
his
head
bent
down
what
do
you
think
of
it
all
she
said
the
king
loves
her
he
replied
but
you
seem
to
think
she
does
not
love
him
alas
madame
i
was
thinking
of
the
time
when
she
loved
henrietta
was
for
a
moment
struck
with
admiration
at
this
sublime
disbelief
and
then
shrugging
her
shoulders
she
said
you
do
not
believe
me
i
see
how
deeply
you
must
love
her
and
you
doubt
if
she
loves
the
king
i
do
until
i
have
a
proof
of
it
forgive
me
madame
but
she
has
given
me
her
word
and
her
mind
and
heart
are
too
upright
to
tell
a
you
require
a
proof
be
it
so
come
with
me
chapter
liii
a
domiciliary
visit
the
princess
preceding
raoul
led
him
through
the
courtyard
towards
that
part
of
the
building
la
valliere
inhabited
and
ascending
the
same
staircase
which
raoul
himself
had
ascended
that
very
morning
she
paused
at
the
door
of
the
room
in
which
the
young
man
had
been
so
strangely
received
by
montalais
the
opportunity
was
remarkably
well
chosen
to
carry
out
the
project
madame
henrietta
had
conceived
for
the
chateau
was
empty
the
king
the
courtiers
and
the
ladies
of
the
court
had
set
off
for
madame
henrietta
was
the
only
one
who
knew
of
bragelonne
s
return
and
thinking
over
the
advantages
which
might
be
drawn
from
this
return
she
had
feigned
indisposition
in
order
to
remain
behind
madame
was
therefore
confident
of
finding
la
valliere
s
room
and
s
apartment
perfectly
empty
she
took
a
from
her
pocket
and
opened
the
door
of
her
maid
of
honor
s
apartment
bragelonne
s
gaze
was
immediately
fixed
upon
the
interior
of
the
room
which
he
recognized
at
once
and
the
impression
which
the
sight
of
it
produced
upon
him
was
torture
the
princess
looked
at
him
and
her
practiced
eye
at
once
detected
what
was
passing
in
the
young
man
s
heart
you
asked
for
proofs
she
said
do
not
be
astonished
then
if
i
give
you
them
but
if
you
do
not
think
you
have
courage
enough
to
confront
them
there
is
still
time
to
i
thank
you
madame
said
bragelonne
but
i
came
here
to
be
convinced
you
promised
to
convince
me
do
enter
then
said
madame
and
shut
the
door
behind
bragelonne
obeyed
and
then
turned
towards
the
princess
whom
he
interrogated
by
a
look
you
know
where
you
are
i
suppose
inquired
madame
henrietta
everything
leads
me
to
believe
i
am
in
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
you
but
i
would
observe
to
your
highness
that
this
room
is
a
room
and
is
not
a
wait
said
the
princess
as
she
walked
to
the
foot
of
the
bed
folded
up
the
screen
into
its
several
compartments
and
stooped
down
towards
the
floor
look
here
she
continued
stoop
down
and
lift
up
this
a
said
raoul
astonished
for
d
artagnan
s
words
began
to
return
to
his
memory
and
he
had
an
indistinct
recollection
that
d
artagnan
had
made
use
of
the
same
word
he
looked
but
uselessly
for
some
cleft
or
crevice
which
might
indicate
an
opening
or
a
ring
to
assist
in
lifting
up
the
planking
ah
i
forgot
said
madame
henrietta
i
forgot
the
secret
spring
the
fourth
plank
of
the
flooring
press
on
the
spot
where
you
will
observe
a
knot
in
the
wood
those
are
the
instructions
press
vicomte
press
i
say
raoul
pale
as
death
pressed
his
finger
on
the
spot
which
had
been
indicated
to
him
at
the
same
moment
the
spring
began
to
work
and
the
trap
rose
of
its
own
accord
it
is
ingenious
enough
certainly
said
the
princess
and
one
can
see
that
the
architect
foresaw
that
a
woman
s
hand
only
would
have
to
make
use
of
this
spring
for
see
how
easily
the
opened
without
a
staircase
cried
raoul
yes
and
a
very
pretty
one
too
said
madame
henrietta
see
vicomte
the
staircase
has
a
balustrade
intended
to
prevent
the
falling
of
timid
persons
who
might
be
tempted
to
descend
the
staircase
and
i
will
risk
myself
on
it
accordingly
come
vicomte
follow
me
but
before
following
you
madame
may
i
ask
where
this
staircase
leads
to
ah
true
i
forgot
to
tell
you
you
know
perhaps
that
formerly
de
lived
in
the
very
next
apartment
to
the
king
yes
madame
i
am
aware
of
that
that
was
the
arrangement
at
least
before
i
left
and
more
than
once
i
had
the
honor
of
visiting
his
well
he
obtained
the
king
s
leave
to
change
his
former
convenient
and
beautiful
apartment
for
the
two
rooms
to
which
this
staircase
will
conduct
us
and
which
together
form
a
lodging
for
him
half
the
size
and
at
ten
times
greater
the
distance
from
the
king
a
close
proximity
to
whom
is
by
no
means
disdained
in
general
by
the
gentlemen
belonging
to
the
very
good
madame
returned
raoul
but
go
on
i
beg
for
i
do
not
understand
well
then
it
accidentally
happened
continued
the
princess
that
de
s
apartment
is
situated
underneath
the
apartments
of
my
maids
of
honor
and
by
a
further
coincidence
exactly
underneath
the
room
of
la
but
what
was
the
motive
of
this
and
this
staircase
that
i
can
not
tell
you
would
you
like
to
go
down
to
monsieur
de
s
rooms
perhaps
we
shall
be
able
to
find
the
solution
of
the
enigma
and
madame
set
the
example
by
going
down
herself
while
raoul
sighing
deeply
followed
her
at
every
step
bragelonne
took
he
advanced
further
into
that
mysterious
apartment
which
had
witnessed
la
valliere
s
sighs
and
still
retained
the
perfume
of
her
presence
bragelonne
fancied
he
perceived
as
he
inhaled
the
atmosphere
that
the
young
girl
must
have
passed
through
then
succeeded
to
these
emanations
of
herself
which
he
regarded
as
invisible
though
certain
proofs
flowers
she
preferred
to
all
others
books
of
her
own
selection
if
raoul
retained
a
single
doubt
on
the
subject
it
would
have
vanished
at
the
secret
harmony
of
tastes
and
connection
of
the
mind
with
the
ordinary
objects
of
life
la
valliere
in
bragelonne
s
eyes
was
present
there
in
each
article
of
furniture
in
the
color
of
the
hangings
in
all
that
surrounded
him
dumb
and
now
completely
overwhelmed
there
was
nothing
further
for
him
now
to
learn
and
he
followed
his
pitiless
conductress
as
blindly
as
the
culprit
follows
the
executioner
while
madame
as
cruel
as
women
of
overstrung
temperaments
generally
are
did
not
spare
him
the
slightest
detail
but
it
must
be
admitted
that
notwithstanding
the
kind
of
apathy
into
which
he
had
fallen
none
of
these
details
even
had
he
been
left
alone
would
have
escaped
him
the
happiness
of
the
woman
who
loves
when
that
happiness
is
derived
from
a
rival
is
a
living
torture
for
a
jealous
man
but
for
a
jealous
man
such
as
raoul
was
for
one
whose
heart
for
the
first
time
in
its
existence
was
being
steeped
in
gall
and
bitterness
louise
s
happiness
was
in
reality
an
ignominious
death
a
death
of
body
and
soul
he
guessed
all
he
fancied
he
could
see
them
with
their
hands
clasped
in
each
other
s
their
faces
drawn
close
together
and
reflected
side
by
side
in
loving
proximity
and
they
gazed
upon
the
mirrors
around
them
so
sweet
an
occupation
for
lovers
who
as
they
thus
see
themselves
twice
over
imprint
the
picture
still
more
deeply
on
their
memories
he
could
guess
too
the
stolen
kiss
snatched
as
they
separated
from
each
other
s
loved
society
the
luxury
the
studied
elegance
eloquent
of
the
perfection
of
indolence
of
ease
the
extreme
care
shown
either
to
spare
the
loved
object
every
annoyance
or
to
occasion
her
a
delightful
surprise
that
might
and
majesty
of
love
multiplied
by
the
majesty
and
might
of
royalty
itself
seemed
like
a
to
raoul
if
there
be
anything
which
can
in
any
way
assuage
or
mitigate
the
tortures
of
jealousy
it
is
the
inferiority
of
the
man
who
is
preferred
to
yourself
whilst
on
the
very
contrary
if
there
be
one
anguish
more
bitter
than
another
a
misery
for
which
language
lacks
a
word
it
is
the
superiority
of
the
man
preferred
to
yourself
superior
perhaps
in
youth
beauty
grace
it
is
in
such
moments
as
these
that
heaven
almost
seems
to
have
taken
part
against
the
disdained
and
rejected
lover
one
final
pang
was
reserved
for
poor
raoul
madame
henrietta
lifted
up
a
silk
curtain
and
behind
the
canvas
he
perceived
la
valliere
s
portrait
not
only
the
portrait
of
la
valliere
but
of
la
valliere
radiant
with
youth
beauty
and
happiness
inhaling
life
and
enjoyment
at
every
pore
because
at
eighteen
years
of
age
love
itself
is
life
louise
murmured
bragelonne
louise
is
it
true
then
oh
you
have
never
loved
me
for
never
have
you
looked
at
me
in
that
and
he
felt
as
if
his
heart
were
crushed
within
his
bosom
madame
henrietta
looked
at
him
almost
envious
of
his
extreme
grief
although
she
well
knew
there
was
nothing
to
envy
in
it
and
that
she
herself
was
as
passionately
loved
by
de
guiche
as
louise
by
bragelonne
raoul
interpreted
madame
henrietta
s
look
oh
forgive
me
forgive
me
madame
in
your
presence
i
know
i
ought
to
have
greater
but
heaven
grant
that
you
may
never
be
struck
by
similar
misery
to
that
which
crushes
me
at
this
moment
for
you
are
but
a
woman
and
would
not
be
able
to
endure
so
terrible
an
affliction
forgive
me
i
again
entreat
you
madame
i
am
but
a
man
without
rank
or
position
while
you
belong
to
a
race
whose
happiness
knows
no
bounds
whose
power
acknowledges
no
monsieur
de
bragelonne
replied
henrietta
a
mind
such
as
your
merits
all
the
consideration
and
respect
which
a
queen
s
heart
even
can
bestow
regard
me
as
your
friend
monsieur
and
as
such
indeed
i
would
not
allow
your
whole
life
to
be
poisoned
by
perfidy
and
covered
with
ridicule
it
was
i
indeed
who
with
more
courage
than
any
of
your
pretended
friends
i
except
de
guiche
was
the
cause
of
your
return
from
london
it
is
i
also
who
now
give
you
the
melancholy
proofs
necessary
however
for
your
cure
if
you
are
a
lover
with
courage
in
his
heart
and
not
a
weeping
amadis
do
not
thank
me
pity
me
even
and
do
not
serve
the
king
less
faithfully
than
you
have
raoul
smiled
bitterly
ah
true
true
i
was
forgetting
that
the
king
is
my
your
liberty
nay
your
very
life
is
in
a
steady
penetrating
look
informed
madame
henrietta
that
she
was
mistaken
and
that
her
last
argument
was
not
a
likely
one
to
affect
the
young
man
take
care
monsieur
de
bragelonne
she
said
for
if
you
do
not
weigh
well
all
your
actions
you
might
throw
into
an
extravagance
of
wrath
a
prince
whose
passions
once
aroused
exceed
the
bounds
of
reason
and
you
would
thereby
involve
your
friends
and
family
in
the
deepest
distress
you
must
bend
you
must
submit
and
you
must
cure
i
thank
you
madame
i
appreciate
the
advice
your
royal
highness
is
good
enough
to
give
me
and
i
will
endeavor
to
follow
it
but
one
final
word
i
name
should
i
be
indiscreet
in
asking
you
the
secret
of
this
staircase
of
this
a
secret
which
it
seems
you
have
discovered
nothing
more
simple
for
the
purpose
of
exercising
a
surveillance
over
the
young
girls
who
are
attached
to
my
service
i
have
duplicate
keys
of
their
doors
it
seemed
very
strange
to
me
that
de
should
change
his
apartments
it
seemed
very
strange
that
the
king
should
come
to
see
de
every
day
and
finally
it
seemed
very
strange
that
so
many
things
should
be
done
during
your
absence
that
the
very
habits
and
customs
of
the
court
appeared
changed
i
do
not
wish
to
be
trifled
with
by
the
king
nor
to
serve
as
a
cloak
for
his
love
affairs
for
after
la
valliere
who
weeps
incessantly
he
will
take
a
fancy
to
montalais
who
is
always
laughing
and
then
to
who
does
nothing
but
sing
all
day
to
act
such
a
part
as
that
would
be
unworthy
of
me
i
thrust
aside
the
scruples
which
my
friendship
for
you
suggested
i
discovered
the
secret
i
have
wounded
your
feelings
i
know
and
i
again
entreat
you
to
pardon
me
but
i
had
a
duty
to
fulfil
i
have
discharged
it
you
are
now
forewarned
the
tempest
will
soon
burst
protect
yourself
you
naturally
expect
however
that
a
result
of
some
kind
must
follow
replied
bragelonne
with
firmness
for
you
do
not
suppose
i
shall
silently
accept
the
shame
thus
thrust
upon
me
or
the
treachery
which
has
been
practiced
against
me
you
will
take
whatever
steps
in
the
matter
you
please
monsieur
raoul
only
do
not
betray
the
source
whence
you
derived
the
truth
that
is
all
i
have
to
ask
the
only
price
i
require
for
the
service
i
have
rendered
fear
nothing
madame
said
bragelonne
with
a
bitter
smile
i
bribed
the
locksmith
in
whom
the
lovers
confided
you
can
just
as
well
have
done
so
as
myself
can
you
not
yes
madame
your
royal
highness
however
has
no
other
advice
or
caution
to
give
me
except
that
of
not
betraying
you
i
am
about
therefore
to
beg
your
royal
highness
to
allow
me
to
remain
here
for
one
without
me
oh
no
madame
it
matters
very
little
for
what
i
have
to
do
can
be
done
in
your
presence
i
only
ask
one
moment
to
write
a
line
to
some
it
is
dangerous
monsieur
de
bragelonne
take
no
one
can
possibly
know
that
your
royal
highness
has
done
me
the
honor
to
conduct
me
here
besides
i
shall
sign
the
letter
i
am
going
to
do
as
you
please
raoul
drew
out
his
tablet
and
wrote
rapidly
on
one
of
the
leaves
the
following
words
monsieur
le
comte
do
not
be
surprised
to
find
this
paper
signed
by
me
the
friend
i
shall
very
shortly
send
to
call
on
you
will
have
the
honor
to
explain
the
object
of
my
visit
vicomte
raoul
de
he
rolled
up
the
paper
slipped
it
into
the
lock
of
the
door
which
communicated
with
the
room
set
apart
for
the
two
lovers
and
satisfied
himself
that
the
missive
was
so
apparent
that
could
not
but
see
it
as
he
entered
he
rejoined
the
princess
who
had
already
reached
the
top
of
the
staircase
they
then
separated
raoul
pretending
to
thank
her
highness
henrietta
pitying
or
seeming
to
pity
with
all
her
heart
the
wretched
young
man
she
had
just
condemned
to
such
fearful
torture
oh
she
said
as
she
saw
him
disappear
pale
as
death
and
his
eyes
bursting
with
blood
if
i
had
foreseen
this
i
would
have
hid
the
truth
from
that
poor
chapter
liv
porthos
s
plan
of
action
the
great
number
of
individuals
we
have
introduced
into
this
long
story
is
the
reason
why
each
of
them
has
been
forced
to
appear
only
in
turn
according
to
the
exigencies
of
the
recital
the
result
is
that
our
readers
have
had
no
opportunity
of
meeting
our
friend
porthos
since
his
return
from
fontainebleau
the
honors
which
he
had
received
from
the
king
had
not
changed
the
easy
affectionate
character
of
that
man
he
may
perhaps
have
held
up
his
head
a
little
higher
than
usual
and
a
majesty
of
demeanor
as
it
were
may
have
betrayed
itself
since
the
honor
of
dining
at
the
king
s
table
had
been
accorded
him
his
majesty
s
had
produced
a
certain
effect
on
porthos
le
seigneur
de
bracieux
et
de
pierrefonds
delighted
to
remember
that
during
that
memorable
dinner
the
numerous
array
of
servants
and
the
large
number
of
officials
in
attendance
on
the
guests
gave
a
certain
tone
and
effect
to
the
repast
and
seemed
as
it
were
to
furnish
the
room
porthos
undertook
to
confer
upon
mouston
a
position
of
some
kind
or
other
in
order
to
establish
a
sort
of
hierarchy
among
his
other
domestics
and
to
create
a
military
household
which
was
not
unusual
among
the
great
captains
of
the
age
since
in
the
preceding
century
this
luxury
had
been
greatly
encouraged
by
messieurs
de
treville
de
schomberg
de
la
vieuville
without
alluding
to
de
richelieu
de
conde
and
de
and
therefore
why
should
not
he
porthos
the
friend
of
the
king
and
of
fouquet
a
baron
and
engineer
why
should
not
he
indeed
enjoy
all
the
delightful
privileges
which
large
possessions
and
unusual
merit
invariably
confer
somewhat
neglected
by
aramis
who
we
know
was
greatly
occupied
with
fouquet
neglected
also
on
account
of
his
being
on
duty
by
d
artagnan
tired
of
truchen
and
planchet
porthos
was
surprised
to
find
himself
dreaming
without
precisely
knowing
why
but
if
any
one
had
said
to
him
do
you
want
anything
porthos
he
would
most
certainly
have
replied
after
one
of
those
dinners
during
which
porthos
attempted
to
recall
to
his
recollection
all
the
details
of
the
royal
banquet
gently
joyful
thanks
to
the
excellence
of
the
wines
gently
melancholy
thanks
to
his
ambitious
ideas
porthos
was
gradually
falling
off
into
a
placid
doze
when
his
servant
entered
to
announce
that
de
bragelonne
wished
to
speak
to
him
porthos
passed
into
an
adjoining
room
where
he
found
his
young
friend
in
the
disposition
of
mind
we
are
already
aware
of
raoul
advanced
towards
porthos
and
shook
him
by
the
hand
porthos
surprised
at
his
seriousness
of
aspect
offered
him
a
seat
dear
du
vallon
said
raoul
i
have
a
service
to
ask
of
nothing
could
happen
more
fortunately
my
young
friend
replied
porthos
i
have
eight
thousand
livres
sent
me
this
morning
from
pierrefonds
and
if
you
want
any
money
no
i
thank
you
it
is
not
so
much
the
worse
then
i
have
always
heard
it
said
that
that
is
the
rarest
service
but
the
easiest
to
render
the
remark
struck
me
i
like
to
cite
remarks
that
strike
your
heart
is
as
good
as
your
mind
is
sound
and
you
are
much
too
kind
i
declare
you
will
dine
here
of
course
no
i
am
not
eh
not
dine
what
a
dreadful
country
england
is
not
too
much
so
indeed
but
well
if
such
excellent
fish
and
meat
were
not
to
be
procured
there
it
would
hardly
be
yes
i
came
to
i
am
listening
only
just
allow
me
to
take
a
little
sip
one
gets
thirsty
in
paris
and
he
ordered
a
bottle
of
champagne
to
be
brought
and
having
first
filled
raoul
s
glass
he
filled
his
own
drank
it
down
at
a
gulp
and
then
resumed
i
needed
that
in
order
to
listen
to
you
with
proper
attention
i
am
now
entirely
at
your
service
what
do
you
wish
to
ask
me
dear
raoul
what
do
you
want
give
me
your
opinion
on
quarrels
in
general
my
dear
my
opinion
well
but
explain
your
idea
a
little
more
coherently
replied
porthos
rubbing
his
forehead
i
mean
you
are
generally
whenever
any
misunderstanding
arises
between
a
friend
of
yours
and
a
stranger
for
instance
oh
in
the
best
of
very
good
but
what
do
you
do
in
such
a
case
whenever
any
friend
of
mine
gets
into
a
quarrel
i
always
act
on
one
what
is
that
that
lost
time
is
irreparable
and
one
never
arranges
an
affair
so
well
as
when
everything
has
been
done
to
embroil
the
disputants
as
much
as
ah
indeed
is
that
the
principle
on
which
you
proceed
precisely
so
as
soon
as
a
quarrel
takes
place
i
bring
the
two
parties
you
understand
that
by
this
means
it
is
impossible
for
an
affair
not
to
be
i
should
have
thought
that
treated
in
this
manner
an
affair
would
on
the
contrary
oh
not
the
least
in
the
world
just
fancy
now
i
have
had
in
my
life
something
like
a
hundred
and
eighty
to
a
hundred
and
ninety
regular
duels
without
reckoning
hasty
encounters
or
chance
it
is
a
very
handsome
aggregate
said
raoul
unable
to
resist
a
smile
a
mere
nothing
but
i
am
so
gentle
d
artagnan
reckons
his
duels
by
hundreds
it
is
very
true
he
is
a
little
too
hard
and
sharp
i
have
often
told
him
and
so
resumed
raoul
you
generally
arrange
the
affairs
of
honor
your
friends
confide
to
there
is
not
a
single
instance
in
which
i
have
not
finished
by
arranging
every
one
of
them
said
porthos
with
a
gentleness
and
confidence
that
surprised
raoul
but
the
way
in
which
you
settle
them
is
at
least
honorable
i
suppose
oh
rely
upon
that
and
at
this
stage
i
will
explain
my
other
principle
to
you
as
soon
as
my
friend
has
intrusted
his
quarrel
to
me
this
is
what
i
do
i
go
to
his
adversary
at
once
armed
with
a
politeness
and
absolutely
requisite
under
such
that
is
the
way
then
said
raoul
bitterly
that
you
arrange
affairs
so
i
believe
you
i
go
to
the
adversary
then
and
say
to
him
it
is
impossible
monsieur
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
extent
to
which
you
have
insulted
my
raoul
frowned
at
this
remark
it
sometimes
happens
very
often
indeed
pursued
porthos
that
my
friend
has
not
been
insulted
at
all
he
has
even
been
the
first
to
give
offense
you
can
imagine
therefore
whether
my
language
is
or
is
not
well
and
porthos
burst
into
a
peal
of
laughter
decidedly
said
raoul
to
himself
while
the
merry
thunder
of
porthos
s
laughter
was
resounding
in
his
ears
i
am
very
unfortunate
de
guiche
treats
me
with
coolness
d
artagnan
with
ridicule
porthos
is
too
tame
no
one
will
settle
this
affair
in
the
only
way
i
wish
it
to
be
settled
and
i
came
to
porthos
because
i
wanted
to
find
a
sword
instead
of
cold
reasoning
at
my
service
my
dogs
porthos
who
had
recovered
himself
continued
by
one
simple
expression
i
leave
my
adversary
without
an
that
is
as
it
may
happen
said
raoul
absently
not
at
all
it
is
quite
certain
i
have
not
left
him
an
excuse
and
then
it
is
that
i
display
all
my
courtesy
in
order
to
attain
the
happy
issue
of
my
project
i
advance
therefore
with
an
air
of
great
politeness
and
taking
my
adversary
by
the
hand
i
say
to
him
now
that
you
are
convinced
of
having
given
the
offense
we
are
sure
of
reparation
between
my
friend
and
yourself
the
future
can
only
offer
an
exchange
of
mutual
courtesies
of
conduct
and
consequently
my
mission
now
is
to
acquaint
you
with
the
length
of
my
friend
s
what
said
raoul
wait
a
minute
the
length
of
my
friend
s
sword
my
horse
is
waiting
below
my
friend
is
in
such
and
such
a
spot
and
is
impatiently
awaiting
your
agreeable
society
i
will
take
you
with
me
we
can
call
upon
your
second
as
we
go
along
and
the
affair
is
and
so
said
raoul
pale
with
vexation
you
reconcile
the
two
adversaries
on
the
i
beg
your
pardon
interrupted
porthos
reconcile
what
for
you
said
that
the
affair
was
of
course
since
my
friend
is
waiting
for
well
what
then
if
he
is
waiting
well
if
he
is
waiting
it
is
merely
to
stretch
his
legs
a
little
the
adversary
on
the
contrary
is
stiff
from
riding
they
place
themselves
in
proper
order
and
my
friend
kills
the
opponent
and
the
affair
is
ah
he
kills
him
then
cried
raoul
i
should
think
so
said
porthos
is
it
likely
i
should
ever
have
as
a
friend
a
man
who
allows
himself
to
get
killed
i
have
a
hundred
and
one
friends
at
the
head
of
the
list
stand
your
father
aramis
and
d
artagnan
all
of
whom
are
living
and
well
i
believe
oh
my
dear
baron
exclaimed
raoul
as
he
embraced
porthos
you
approve
of
my
method
then
said
the
giant
i
approve
of
it
so
thoroughly
that
i
shall
have
recourse
to
it
this
very
day
without
a
moment
s
delay
at
once
in
fact
you
are
the
very
man
i
have
been
looking
good
here
i
am
then
you
want
to
fight
i
suppose
it
is
very
natural
with
whom
with
de
i
know
him
a
most
agreeable
man
who
was
exceedingly
polite
to
me
the
day
i
had
the
honor
of
dining
with
the
king
i
shall
certainly
acknowledge
his
politeness
in
return
even
if
it
had
not
happened
to
be
my
usual
custom
so
he
has
given
you
an
offense
a
mortal
the
deuce
i
can
say
so
i
suppose
more
than
that
even
if
you
that
is
a
very
great
i
may
look
upon
it
as
one
of
your
arranged
affairs
may
i
not
said
raoul
smiling
as
a
matter
of
course
where
will
you
be
waiting
for
him
ah
i
forgot
it
is
a
very
delicate
matter
de
is
a
very
great
friend
of
the
king
so
i
have
heard
it
so
that
if
i
kill
him
oh
you
will
kill
him
certainly
you
must
take
every
precaution
to
do
so
but
there
is
no
difficulty
in
these
matters
now
if
you
had
lived
in
our
early
days
ah
those
were
days
worth
living
for
my
dear
friend
you
do
not
quite
understand
me
i
mean
that
de
being
a
friend
of
the
king
the
affair
will
be
more
difficult
to
manage
since
the
king
might
learn
beforehand
oh
no
that
is
not
likely
you
know
my
method
monsieur
you
have
just
injured
my
friend
and
yes
i
know
and
then
monsieur
i
have
horses
i
carry
him
off
before
he
can
have
spoken
to
any
will
he
allow
himself
to
be
carried
off
like
that
i
should
think
so
i
should
like
to
see
it
fail
it
would
be
the
first
time
if
it
did
it
is
true
though
that
the
young
men
of
the
present
day
bah
i
would
carry
him
off
bodily
if
that
were
all
and
porthos
adding
gesture
to
speech
lifted
raoul
and
the
chair
he
was
sitting
on
off
the
ground
and
carried
them
round
the
room
very
good
said
raoul
laughing
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
state
the
grounds
of
the
quarrel
with
de
well
but
that
is
done
it
no
my
dear
du
vallon
the
usage
of
the
present
day
requires
that
the
cause
of
the
quarrel
should
be
very
good
tell
me
what
it
is
the
fact
is
deuce
take
it
how
troublesome
all
this
is
in
former
days
we
had
no
occasion
to
say
anything
about
the
matter
people
fought
for
the
sake
of
fighting
and
i
for
one
know
no
better
reason
than
you
are
quite
right
du
however
tell
me
what
the
cause
it
is
too
long
a
story
to
tell
only
as
one
must
particularize
to
a
certain
extent
and
as
on
the
other
hand
the
affair
is
full
of
difficulties
and
requires
the
most
absolute
secrecy
you
will
have
the
kindness
merely
to
tell
de
that
he
has
in
the
first
place
insulted
me
by
changing
his
by
changing
his
lodgings
good
said
porthos
who
began
to
count
on
his
fingers
next
then
in
getting
a
made
in
his
new
i
understand
said
porthos
a
upon
my
word
that
is
very
serious
you
ought
to
be
furious
at
that
what
the
deuce
does
the
fellow
mean
by
getting
made
without
first
consulting
you
i
haven
t
got
any
except
in
my
dungeons
at
and
you
will
please
add
said
raoul
that
my
last
motive
for
considering
myself
insulted
is
the
existence
of
the
portrait
that
de
well
is
it
possible
a
portrait
too
a
change
of
residence
a
and
a
portrait
why
my
dear
friend
with
but
one
of
these
causes
of
complaint
there
is
enough
and
more
than
enough
for
all
the
gentlemen
in
france
and
spain
to
cut
each
other
s
throats
and
that
is
saying
but
very
well
my
dear
friend
you
are
furnished
with
all
you
need
i
suppose
i
shall
take
a
second
horse
with
me
select
your
own
rendezvous
and
while
you
are
waiting
there
you
can
practice
some
of
the
best
passes
so
as
to
get
your
limbs
as
elastic
as
thank
you
i
shall
be
waiting
for
you
in
the
wood
of
vincennes
close
to
all
goes
well
then
where
am
i
to
find
this
de
at
the
palais
porthos
ran
a
huge
my
court
suit
he
said
to
the
servant
who
answered
the
summons
my
horse
and
a
led
horse
to
accompany
then
turning
to
raoul
as
soon
as
the
servant
had
quitted
the
room
he
said
does
your
father
know
anything
about
this
no
i
am
going
to
write
to
and
d
artagnan
no
nor
d
artagnan
either
he
is
very
cautious
you
know
and
might
have
diverted
me
from
my
d
artagnan
is
a
sound
adviser
though
said
porthos
astonished
that
in
his
own
loyal
faith
in
d
artagnan
any
one
could
have
thought
of
himself
so
long
as
there
was
a
d
artagnan
in
the
world
dear
du
vallon
said
raoul
do
not
question
me
any
more
i
implore
you
i
have
told
you
all
that
i
had
to
say
it
is
prompt
action
i
now
expect
sharp
and
decided
as
you
know
how
to
arrange
it
that
indeed
is
my
reason
for
having
chosen
you
will
be
satisfied
with
me
replied
porthos
do
not
forget
either
that
except
ourselves
no
one
must
know
anything
of
this
people
generally
find
these
things
out
said
porthos
dryly
when
a
dead
body
is
discovered
in
a
wood
but
i
promise
everything
my
dear
friend
except
the
concealment
of
the
dead
body
there
it
is
and
it
must
be
seen
as
a
matter
of
course
it
is
a
principle
of
mine
not
to
bury
bodies
that
has
a
smack
of
the
assassin
about
it
every
risk
has
its
to
work
then
my
dear
rely
upon
me
said
the
giant
finishing
the
bottle
while
a
servant
spread
out
upon
a
sofa
the
gorgeously
decorated
dress
trimmed
with
lace
raoul
left
the
room
saying
to
himself
with
a
secret
delight
perfidious
king
traitorous
monarch
i
can
not
reach
thee
i
do
not
wish
it
for
kings
are
sacred
objects
but
your
friend
your
accomplice
your
panderer
the
coward
who
represents
you
shall
pay
for
your
crime
i
will
kill
him
in
thy
name
and
afterwards
we
will
bethink
ourselves
of
chapter
lv
the
change
of
residence
the
and
the
portrait
porthos
intrusted
to
his
great
delight
with
this
mission
which
made
him
feel
young
again
took
half
an
hour
less
than
his
usual
time
to
put
on
his
court
suit
to
show
that
he
was
a
man
acquainted
with
the
usages
of
high
society
he
had
begun
by
sending
his
lackey
to
inquire
if
monsieur
de
were
at
home
and
heard
in
answer
that
le
comte
de
had
had
the
honor
of
accompanying
the
king
to
as
well
as
the
whole
court
but
that
monsieur
le
comte
had
just
that
moment
returned
immediately
upon
this
reply
porthos
made
as
much
haste
as
possible
and
reached
s
apartments
just
as
the
latter
was
having
his
boots
taken
off
the
promenade
had
been
delightful
the
king
who
was
in
love
more
than
ever
and
of
course
happier
than
ever
behaved
in
the
most
charming
manner
to
every
one
nothing
could
possibly
equal
his
kindness
de
it
may
be
remembered
was
a
poet
and
fancied
that
he
had
proved
that
he
was
so
under
too
many
a
memorable
circumstance
to
allow
the
title
to
be
disputed
by
any
one
an
indefatigable
rhymester
he
had
during
the
whole
of
the
journey
overwhelmed
with
quatrains
sextains
and
madrigals
first
the
king
and
then
la
valliere
the
king
on
his
side
was
in
a
similarly
poetical
mood
and
had
made
a
distich
while
la
valliere
delighting
in
poetry
as
most
women
do
who
are
in
love
had
composed
two
sonnets
the
day
then
had
not
been
a
bad
one
for
apollo
and
so
as
soon
as
he
had
returned
to
paris
who
knew
beforehand
that
his
verse
would
be
sure
to
be
extensively
circulated
in
court
circles
occupied
himself
with
a
little
more
attention
than
he
had
been
able
to
bestow
during
the
promenade
with
the
composition
as
well
as
with
the
idea
itself
consequently
with
all
the
tenderness
of
a
father
about
to
start
his
children
in
life
he
candidly
interrogated
himself
whether
the
public
would
find
these
offsprings
of
his
imagination
sufficiently
elegant
and
graceful
and
in
order
to
make
his
mind
easy
on
the
subject
de
recited
to
himself
the
madrigal
he
had
composed
and
which
he
had
repeated
from
memory
to
the
king
and
had
promised
to
write
out
for
him
on
his
return
all
the
time
he
was
committing
these
words
to
memory
the
comte
was
engaged
in
undressing
himself
more
completely
he
had
just
taken
off
his
coat
and
was
putting
on
his
when
he
was
informed
that
monsieur
le
baron
du
vallon
de
bracieux
de
pierrefonds
was
waiting
to
be
received
eh
he
said
what
does
that
bunch
of
names
mean
i
don
t
know
anything
about
it
is
the
same
gentleman
replied
the
lackey
who
had
the
honor
of
dining
with
you
monseigneur
at
the
king
s
table
when
his
majesty
was
staying
at
introduce
him
then
at
once
cried
porthos
in
a
few
minutes
entered
the
room
de
had
an
excellent
recollection
of
persons
and
at
the
first
glance
he
recognized
the
gentleman
from
the
country
who
enjoyed
so
singular
a
reputation
and
whom
the
king
had
received
so
favorably
at
fontainebleau
in
spite
of
the
smiles
of
some
of
those
who
were
present
he
therefore
advanced
towards
porthos
with
all
the
outward
signs
of
consideration
of
manner
which
porthos
thought
but
natural
considering
that
he
himself
whenever
he
called
upon
an
adversary
hoisted
a
standard
of
the
most
refined
politeness
desired
the
servant
to
give
porthos
a
chair
and
the
latter
who
saw
nothing
unusual
in
this
act
of
politeness
sat
down
gravely
and
coughed
the
ordinary
courtesies
having
been
exchanged
between
the
two
gentlemen
the
comte
to
whom
the
visit
was
paid
said
may
i
ask
monsieur
le
baron
to
what
happy
circumstance
i
am
indebted
for
the
favor
of
a
visit
from
you
the
very
thing
i
am
about
to
have
the
honor
of
explaining
to
you
monsieur
le
comte
but
i
beg
your
pardon
what
is
the
matter
monsieur
inquired
i
regret
to
say
that
i
have
broken
your
not
at
all
monsieur
said
not
at
it
is
the
fact
though
monsieur
le
comte
i
have
broken
it
so
much
so
indeed
that
if
i
do
not
move
i
shall
fall
down
which
would
be
an
exceedingly
disagreeable
position
for
me
in
the
discharge
of
the
very
serious
mission
which
has
been
intrusted
to
me
with
regard
to
porthos
rose
and
but
just
in
time
for
the
chair
had
given
way
several
inches
looked
about
him
for
something
more
solid
for
his
guest
to
sit
upon
modern
articles
of
furniture
said
porthos
while
the
comte
was
looking
about
are
constructed
in
a
ridiculously
flimsy
manner
in
my
early
days
when
i
used
to
sit
down
with
far
more
energy
than
is
now
the
case
i
do
not
remember
ever
to
have
broken
a
chair
except
in
taverns
with
my
smiled
at
this
remark
but
said
porthos
as
he
settled
himself
down
on
a
couch
which
creaked
but
did
not
give
way
beneath
his
weight
that
unfortunately
has
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
my
present
why
unfortunately
are
you
the
bearer
of
a
message
of
monsieur
le
baron
of
for
a
gentleman
certainly
not
monsieur
le
comte
replied
porthos
nobly
i
have
simply
come
to
say
that
you
have
seriously
insulted
a
friend
of
i
monsieur
exclaimed
i
have
insulted
a
friend
of
yours
do
you
say
may
i
ask
his
name
m
raoul
de
i
have
insulted
raoul
de
bragelonne
cried
i
really
assure
you
monsieur
that
it
is
quite
impossible
for
de
bragelonne
whom
i
know
but
very
slightly
nay
whom
i
know
hardly
at
all
is
in
england
and
as
i
have
not
seen
him
for
a
long
time
past
i
can
not
possibly
have
insulted
m
de
bragelonne
is
in
paris
monsieur
le
comte
said
porthos
perfectly
unmoved
and
i
repeat
it
is
quite
certain
you
have
insulted
him
since
he
himself
told
me
you
had
yes
monsieur
you
have
seriously
insulted
him
mortally
insulted
him
i
it
is
impossible
monsieur
le
baron
i
swear
quite
besides
added
porthos
you
can
not
be
ignorant
of
the
circumstance
since
de
bragelonne
informed
me
that
he
had
already
apprised
you
of
it
by
a
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
monsieur
that
i
have
received
no
note
this
is
most
extraordinary
replied
porthos
i
will
convince
you
said
that
have
received
nothing
in
any
way
from
and
he
rang
the
bell
basque
he
said
to
the
servant
who
entered
how
many
letters
or
notes
were
sent
here
during
my
absence
three
monsieur
le
comte
a
note
from
de
fiesque
one
from
madame
de
laferte
and
a
letter
from
de
las
is
that
all
yes
monsieur
le
speak
the
truth
before
this
gentleman
the
truth
you
understand
i
will
take
care
you
are
not
there
was
a
note
also
from
from
well
from
whom
from
mademoiselle
de
out
with
it
de
that
is
quite
sufficient
interrupted
porthos
i
believe
you
monsieur
le
dismissed
the
valet
and
followed
him
to
the
door
in
order
to
close
it
after
him
and
when
he
had
done
so
looking
straight
before
him
he
happened
to
see
in
the
keyhole
of
the
adjoining
apartment
the
paper
which
bragelonne
had
slipped
in
there
as
he
left
what
is
this
he
said
porthos
who
was
sitting
with
his
back
to
the
room
turned
round
aha
he
said
a
note
in
the
keyhole
exclaimed
that
is
not
unlikely
to
be
the
missing
letter
monsieur
le
comte
said
porthos
took
out
the
paper
a
note
from
de
bragelonne
he
exclaimed
you
see
monsieur
i
was
right
oh
when
i
say
a
thing
brought
here
by
de
bragelonne
himself
the
comte
murmured
turning
pale
this
is
infamous
how
could
he
possibly
have
come
here
and
the
comte
rang
again
who
has
been
here
during
my
absence
with
the
king
no
one
that
is
impossible
some
one
must
have
been
no
one
could
possibly
have
entered
monsieur
since
the
keys
have
never
left
my
and
yet
i
find
the
letter
in
yonder
lock
some
one
must
have
put
it
there
it
could
not
have
come
here
of
its
own
basque
opened
his
arms
as
if
signifying
the
most
absolute
ignorance
on
the
subject
probably
it
was
de
bragelonne
himself
who
placed
it
there
said
porthos
in
that
case
he
must
have
entered
how
could
that
have
been
since
i
have
the
key
in
my
own
pocket
returned
basque
perseveringly
crumpled
the
letter
in
his
palm
after
having
read
it
there
is
something
mysterious
about
this
he
murmured
absorbed
in
thought
porthos
left
him
to
his
reflections
but
after
a
while
returned
to
the
mission
he
had
undertaken
shall
we
return
to
our
little
affair
porthos
resumed
addressing
after
a
brief
pause
i
think
i
can
now
understand
it
from
this
note
which
has
arrived
here
in
so
singular
a
manner
monsieur
de
bragelonne
says
that
a
friend
will
i
am
his
friend
i
am
the
person
he
alludes
for
the
purpose
of
giving
me
a
challenge
and
he
complains
that
i
have
insulted
him
in
what
way
may
i
ask
for
his
conduct
is
so
mysterious
that
at
least
it
needs
some
explanation
monsieur
replied
porthos
my
friend
can
not
but
be
right
and
as
far
as
his
conduct
is
concerned
if
it
be
mysterious
as
you
say
you
have
only
yourself
to
blame
for
porthos
pronounced
these
words
with
an
amount
of
confidence
which
for
a
man
who
was
unaccustomed
to
his
ways
must
have
revealed
an
infinity
of
sense
mystery
so
be
it
but
what
is
all
the
mystery
about
said
you
will
think
it
the
best
perhaps
porthos
replied
with
a
low
bow
if
i
do
not
enter
in
to
oh
i
perfectly
understand
we
will
touch
very
lightly
upon
it
then
so
speak
monsieur
i
am
in
the
first
place
monsieur
said
porthos
you
have
changed
your
yes
that
is
quite
true
said
you
admit
it
said
porthos
with
an
air
of
satisfaction
admit
it
of
course
i
admit
it
why
should
i
not
admit
it
do
you
suppose
you
have
admitted
it
very
good
said
porthos
lifting
up
one
finger
but
how
can
my
having
moved
my
lodgings
have
done
de
bragelonne
any
harm
have
the
goodness
to
tell
me
that
for
i
positively
do
not
comprehend
a
word
of
what
you
are
porthos
stopped
him
and
then
said
with
great
gravity
monsieur
this
is
the
first
of
de
bragelonne
s
complaints
against
you
if
he
makes
a
complaint
it
is
because
he
feels
himself
began
to
beat
his
foot
impatiently
on
the
ground
this
looks
like
a
spurious
quarrel
he
said
no
one
can
possibly
have
a
spurious
quarrel
with
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
returned
porthos
but
at
all
events
you
have
nothing
to
add
on
the
subject
of
your
changing
your
apartments
i
suppose
nothing
and
what
is
the
next
point
ah
the
next
you
will
observe
monsieur
that
the
one
i
have
already
mentioned
is
a
most
serious
injury
to
which
you
have
given
no
answer
or
rather
have
answered
very
indifferently
is
it
possible
monsieur
that
you
have
changed
your
lodgings
de
bragelonne
feels
insulted
at
your
having
done
so
and
you
do
not
attempt
to
excuse
what
cried
who
was
getting
annoyed
at
the
perfect
coolness
of
his
visitor
what
am
i
to
consult
de
bragelonne
whether
i
am
to
move
or
not
you
can
hardly
be
serious
i
am
and
it
is
absolutely
necessary
monsieur
but
under
any
circumstances
you
will
admit
that
it
is
nothing
in
comparison
with
the
second
ground
of
well
what
is
that
porthos
assumed
a
very
solemn
expression
as
he
said
how
about
the
monsieur
turned
exceedingly
pale
he
pushed
back
his
chair
so
abruptly
that
porthos
simple
as
he
was
perceived
that
the
blow
had
told
the
murmured
yes
monsieur
explain
that
if
you
can
said
porthos
shaking
his
head
held
down
his
head
as
he
murmured
i
have
been
betrayed
everything
is
known
everything
replied
porthos
who
knew
nothing
you
see
me
perfectly
overwhelmed
pursued
overwhelmed
to
a
degree
that
i
hardly
know
what
i
am
a
guilty
conscience
monsieur
your
affair
is
a
bad
one
and
when
the
public
learns
all
about
it
it
will
judge
oh
monsieur
exclaimed
the
count
hurriedly
such
a
secret
ought
not
to
be
known
even
by
one
s
that
we
will
think
about
said
porthos
the
secret
will
not
go
far
in
surely
monsieur
returned
since
de
bragelonne
has
penetrated
the
secret
he
must
be
aware
of
the
danger
he
as
well
as
others
run
the
risk
of
m
de
bragelonne
runs
no
danger
monsieur
nor
does
he
fear
any
either
as
you
if
it
please
heaven
will
find
out
very
this
fellow
is
a
perfect
madman
thought
what
in
heaven
s
name
does
he
want
he
then
said
aloud
come
monsieur
let
us
hush
up
this
you
forget
the
portrait
said
porthos
in
a
voice
of
thunder
which
made
the
comte
s
blood
freeze
in
his
veins
as
the
portrait
in
question
was
la
valliere
s
portrait
and
no
mistake
could
any
longer
exist
on
the
subject
s
eyes
were
completely
opened
ah
he
exclaimed
ah
monsieur
i
remember
now
that
de
bragelonne
was
engaged
to
be
married
to
porthos
assumed
an
imposing
air
all
the
majesty
of
ignorance
in
fact
as
he
said
it
matters
nothing
whatever
to
me
nor
to
yourself
indeed
whether
or
not
my
friend
was
as
you
say
engaged
to
be
married
i
am
even
astonished
that
you
should
have
made
use
of
so
indiscreet
a
remark
it
may
possibly
do
your
cause
harm
monsieur
replied
you
are
the
incarnation
of
intelligence
delicacy
and
loyalty
of
feeling
united
i
see
the
whole
matter
now
clearly
so
much
the
better
said
porthos
and
pursued
you
have
made
me
comprehend
it
in
the
most
ingenious
and
the
most
delicate
manner
possible
i
beg
you
to
accept
my
best
porthos
drew
himself
up
unable
to
resist
the
flattery
of
the
remark
only
now
that
i
know
everything
permit
me
to
explain
porthos
shook
his
head
as
a
man
who
does
not
wish
to
hear
but
continued
i
am
in
despair
i
assure
you
at
all
that
has
happened
but
how
would
you
have
acted
in
my
place
come
between
ourselves
tell
me
what
you
would
have
done
porthos
drew
himself
up
as
he
answered
there
is
now
no
question
at
all
of
what
i
should
have
done
young
man
you
have
been
made
acquainted
with
the
three
causes
of
complaint
against
you
i
believe
as
for
the
first
my
change
of
rooms
and
i
now
address
myself
to
you
as
a
man
of
honor
and
of
great
intelligence
could
i
when
the
desire
of
so
august
a
personage
was
so
urgently
expressed
that
i
should
move
ought
i
to
have
disobeyed
porthos
was
about
to
speak
but
did
not
give
him
time
to
answer
ah
my
frankness
i
see
convinces
you
he
said
interpreting
the
movement
according
to
his
own
fancy
you
feel
that
i
am
porthos
did
not
reply
and
so
continued
i
pass
by
that
unfortunate
he
said
placing
his
hand
on
porthos
s
arm
that
the
occasion
and
means
of
so
much
unhappiness
and
which
was
constructed
for
you
know
what
well
then
in
plain
truth
do
you
suppose
that
it
was
i
who
of
my
own
accord
in
such
a
place
too
had
that
made
oh
no
you
do
not
believe
it
and
here
again
you
feel
you
guess
you
understand
the
influence
of
a
will
superior
to
my
own
you
can
conceive
the
infatuation
the
blind
irresistible
passion
which
has
been
at
work
but
thank
heaven
i
am
fortunate
in
speaking
to
a
man
who
has
so
much
sensitiveness
of
feeling
and
if
it
were
not
so
indeed
what
an
amount
of
misery
and
scandal
would
fall
upon
her
poor
girl
and
upon
him
whom
i
will
not
porthos
confused
and
bewildered
by
the
eloquence
and
gestures
of
made
a
thousand
efforts
to
stem
this
torrent
of
words
of
which
by
the
by
he
did
not
understand
a
single
one
he
remained
upright
and
motionless
on
his
seat
and
that
was
all
he
could
do
continued
and
gave
a
new
inflection
to
his
voice
and
an
increasing
vehemence
to
his
gesture
as
for
the
portrait
for
i
readily
believe
the
portrait
is
the
principal
cause
of
complaint
tell
me
candidly
if
you
think
me
to
blame
who
was
it
who
wished
to
have
her
portrait
was
it
i
who
is
in
love
with
her
is
it
i
who
wishes
to
gain
her
affection
again
is
it
i
who
took
her
likeness
i
do
you
think
no
a
thousand
times
no
i
know
de
bragelonne
must
be
in
a
state
of
despair
i
know
these
misfortunes
are
most
cruel
but
i
too
am
suffering
as
well
and
yet
there
is
no
possibility
of
offering
any
resistance
suppose
we
were
to
fight
we
would
be
laughed
at
if
he
obstinately
persist
in
his
course
he
is
lost
you
will
tell
me
i
know
that
despair
is
ridiculous
but
then
you
are
a
sensible
man
you
have
understood
me
i
perceived
by
your
serious
thoughtful
embarrassed
air
even
that
the
importance
of
the
situation
we
are
placed
in
has
not
escaped
you
return
therefore
to
de
bragelonne
thank
him
as
i
have
indeed
reason
to
thank
him
for
having
chosen
as
an
intermediary
a
man
of
your
high
merit
believe
me
that
i
shall
on
my
side
preserve
an
eternal
gratitude
for
the
man
who
has
so
ingeniously
so
cleverly
arranged
the
misunderstanding
between
us
and
since
ill
luck
would
have
it
that
the
secret
should
be
known
to
four
instead
of
three
why
this
secret
which
might
make
the
most
ambitious
man
s
fortune
i
am
delighted
to
share
with
you
monsieur
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
am
delighted
at
it
from
this
very
moment
you
can
make
use
of
me
as
you
please
i
place
myself
entirely
at
your
mercy
what
can
i
possibly
do
for
you
what
can
i
solicit
nay
require
even
you
have
only
to
speak
monsieur
only
to
and
according
to
the
familiarly
friendly
fashion
of
that
period
threw
his
arms
round
porthos
and
clasped
him
tenderly
in
his
embrace
porthos
allowed
him
to
do
this
with
the
most
perfect
indifference
speak
resumed
what
do
you
require
monsieur
said
porthos
i
have
a
horse
below
be
good
enough
to
mount
him
he
is
a
very
good
one
and
will
play
you
no
mount
on
horseback
what
for
inquired
with
no
little
curiosity
to
accompany
me
to
where
de
bragelonne
is
waiting
ah
he
wishes
to
speak
to
me
i
suppose
i
can
well
believe
that
he
wishes
to
have
the
details
very
likely
alas
it
is
a
very
delicate
matter
but
at
the
present
moment
i
can
not
for
the
king
is
waiting
for
the
king
must
wait
then
said
porthos
what
do
you
say
the
king
must
wait
interrupted
the
finished
courtier
with
a
smile
of
utter
amazement
for
he
could
not
understand
that
the
king
could
under
any
circumstances
be
supposed
to
have
to
wait
it
is
merely
the
affair
of
a
very
short
hour
returned
porthos
but
where
is
de
bragelonne
waiting
for
me
at
the
minimes
at
ah
indeed
but
are
we
going
to
laugh
over
the
affair
when
we
get
there
i
don
t
think
it
likely
said
porthos
as
his
face
assumed
a
look
of
utter
hardness
but
the
minimes
is
a
rendezvous
where
duels
take
place
and
what
can
i
have
to
do
at
the
minimes
porthos
slowly
drew
his
sword
and
said
that
is
the
length
of
my
friend
s
why
the
man
is
mad
cried
the
color
mounted
to
porthos
s
face
as
he
replied
if
i
had
not
the
honor
of
being
in
your
own
apartment
monsieur
and
of
representing
de
bragelonne
s
interests
i
would
throw
you
out
of
the
window
it
will
be
merely
a
pleasure
postponed
and
you
will
lose
nothing
by
waiting
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
minimes
monsieur
of
your
own
free
will
but
take
care
i
will
carry
you
if
you
do
not
come
basque
cried
as
soon
as
basque
appeared
he
said
the
king
wishes
to
see
monsieur
le
that
is
very
different
said
porthos
the
king
s
service
before
anything
else
we
will
wait
until
this
evening
and
saluting
with
his
usual
courtesy
porthos
left
the
room
delighted
at
having
arranged
another
affair
looked
after
him
as
he
left
and
then
hastily
putting
on
his
court
dress
again
he
ran
off
arranging
his
costume
as
he
went
along
muttering
to
himself
the
minimes
the
minimes
we
shall
see
how
the
king
will
fancy
this
challenge
for
it
is
for
him
after
all
that
is
chapter
lvi
rivals
in
politics
on
his
return
from
the
promenade
which
had
been
so
prolific
in
poetical
effusions
and
in
which
every
one
had
paid
his
or
her
tribute
to
the
muses
as
the
poets
of
the
period
used
to
say
the
king
found
fouquet
waiting
for
an
audience
colbert
had
lain
in
wait
for
his
majesty
in
the
corridor
and
followed
him
like
a
jealous
and
watchful
shadow
colbert
with
his
square
head
his
vulgar
and
untidy
though
rich
costume
somewhat
resembled
a
flemish
gentleman
after
he
had
been
in
his
national
drink
beer
fouquet
at
sight
of
his
enemy
remained
perfectly
unmoved
and
during
the
whole
of
the
scene
which
followed
scrupulously
resolved
to
observe
a
line
of
conduct
particularly
difficult
to
the
man
of
superior
mind
who
does
not
even
wish
to
show
his
contempt
for
fear
of
doing
his
adversary
too
much
honor
colbert
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
his
insolent
expression
of
the
vulgar
joy
he
felt
in
his
opinion
fouquet
s
was
a
game
very
badly
played
and
hopelessly
lost
although
not
yet
finished
colbert
belonged
to
that
school
of
politicians
who
think
cleverness
alone
worthy
of
their
admiration
and
success
the
only
thing
worth
caring
for
colbert
moreover
who
was
not
simply
an
envious
and
jealous
man
but
who
had
the
king
s
interest
really
at
heart
because
he
was
thoroughly
imbued
with
the
highest
sense
of
probity
in
all
matters
of
figures
and
accounts
could
well
afford
to
assign
as
a
pretext
for
his
conduct
that
in
hating
and
doing
his
utmost
to
ruin
fouquet
he
had
nothing
in
view
but
the
welfare
of
the
state
and
the
dignity
of
the
crown
none
of
these
details
escaped
fouquet
s
observation
through
his
enemy
s
thick
bushy
brows
and
despite
the
restless
movement
of
his
eyelids
he
could
by
merely
looking
at
his
eyes
penetrate
to
the
very
bottom
of
colbert
s
heart
and
he
read
to
what
an
unbounded
extent
hate
towards
himself
and
triumph
at
his
approaching
fall
existed
there
but
as
in
observing
everything
he
wished
to
remain
himself
impenetrable
he
composed
his
features
smiled
with
the
charmingly
sympathetic
smile
that
was
peculiarly
his
own
and
saluted
the
king
with
the
most
dignified
and
graceful
ease
and
elasticity
of
manner
sire
he
said
i
perceive
by
your
majesty
s
joyous
air
that
you
have
been
gratified
with
the
most
gratified
indeed
monsieur
le
surintendant
most
gratified
you
were
very
wrong
not
to
come
with
us
as
i
invited
you
to
i
was
working
sire
replied
the
superintendent
who
did
not
even
seem
to
take
the
trouble
to
turn
aside
his
head
in
merest
respect
of
colbert
s
presence
ah
fouquet
cried
the
king
there
is
nothing
like
the
country
i
should
be
delighted
to
live
in
the
country
always
in
the
open
air
and
under
the
i
should
hope
that
your
majesty
is
not
yet
weary
of
the
throne
said
fouquet
no
but
thrones
of
soft
turf
are
very
your
majesty
gratifies
my
utmost
wishes
in
speaking
in
that
manner
for
i
have
a
request
to
submit
to
on
whose
behalf
monsieur
oh
behalf
of
the
nymphs
of
vaux
ah
ah
said
louis
xiv
your
majesty
too
once
deigned
to
make
me
a
promise
said
fouquet
yes
i
remember
the
at
vaux
the
celebrated
i
think
it
was
sire
said
colbert
endeavoring
to
show
his
importance
by
taking
part
in
the
conversation
fouquet
with
the
profoundest
contempt
did
not
take
the
slightest
notice
of
the
remark
as
if
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
colbert
had
not
even
thought
or
said
a
word
your
majesty
is
aware
he
said
that
i
destine
my
estate
at
vaux
to
receive
the
most
amiable
of
princes
the
most
powerful
of
i
have
given
you
my
promise
monsieur
said
louis
smiling
and
a
king
never
departs
from
his
and
i
have
come
now
sire
to
inform
your
majesty
that
i
am
ready
to
obey
your
orders
in
every
do
you
promise
me
many
wonders
monsieur
le
surintendant
said
louis
looking
at
colbert
wonders
oh
no
sire
i
do
not
undertake
that
i
hope
to
be
able
to
procure
your
majesty
a
little
pleasure
perhaps
even
a
little
forgetfulness
of
the
cares
of
nay
nay
fouquet
returned
the
king
i
insist
upon
the
word
you
are
a
magician
i
believe
we
all
know
the
power
you
wield
we
also
know
that
you
can
find
gold
even
when
there
is
none
to
be
found
elsewhere
so
much
so
indeed
that
people
say
you
coin
fouquet
felt
that
the
shot
was
discharged
from
a
double
quiver
and
that
the
king
had
launched
an
arrow
from
his
own
bow
as
well
as
one
from
colbert
s
oh
said
he
laughingly
the
people
know
perfectly
well
out
of
what
mine
i
procure
the
gold
and
they
know
it
only
too
well
perhaps
besides
he
added
i
can
assure
your
majesty
that
the
gold
destined
to
pay
the
expenses
of
the
at
vaux
will
cost
neither
blood
nor
tears
hard
labor
it
may
perhaps
but
that
can
be
paid
louis
paused
quite
confused
he
wished
to
look
at
colbert
colbert
too
wished
to
reply
to
him
a
glance
as
swift
as
an
eagle
s
a
glance
indeed
which
fouquet
darted
at
the
latter
arrested
the
words
upon
his
lips
the
king
who
had
by
this
time
recovered
his
turned
towards
fouquet
saying
i
presume
therefore
i
am
now
to
consider
myself
formally
invited
yes
sire
if
your
majesty
will
condescend
so
far
as
to
accept
my
what
day
have
you
fixed
any
day
your
majesty
may
find
most
you
speak
like
an
enchanter
who
has
but
to
conjure
up
in
actuality
the
wildest
fancies
monsieur
fouquet
i
could
not
say
so
much
indeed
your
majesty
will
do
whenever
you
please
everything
that
a
monarch
can
and
ought
to
do
the
king
of
france
has
servants
at
his
bidding
who
are
able
to
do
anything
on
his
behalf
to
accomplish
everything
to
gratify
his
colbert
tried
to
look
at
the
superintendent
in
order
to
see
whether
this
remark
was
an
approach
to
less
hostile
sentiments
on
his
part
but
fouquet
had
not
even
looked
at
his
enemy
and
colbert
hardly
seemed
to
exist
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
very
good
then
said
the
king
will
a
week
hence
suit
you
perfectly
well
this
is
tuesday
if
i
give
you
until
next
sunday
week
will
that
be
sufficient
the
delay
which
your
majesty
deigns
to
accord
me
will
greatly
aid
the
various
works
which
my
architects
have
in
hand
for
the
purpose
of
adding
to
the
amusement
of
your
majesty
and
your
by
the
by
speaking
of
my
friends
resumed
the
king
how
do
you
intend
to
treat
them
the
king
is
master
everywhere
sire
your
majesty
will
draw
up
your
own
list
and
give
your
own
orders
all
those
you
may
deign
to
invite
will
be
my
guests
my
honored
guests
i
thank
you
returned
the
king
touched
by
the
noble
thought
expressed
in
so
noble
a
tone
fouquet
therefore
took
leave
of
louis
after
a
few
words
had
been
added
with
regard
to
the
details
of
certain
matters
of
business
he
felt
that
colbert
would
remain
behind
with
the
king
that
they
would
both
converse
about
him
and
that
neither
of
them
would
spare
him
in
the
least
degree
the
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
give
a
last
and
terrible
blow
to
his
enemy
seemed
to
him
almost
like
a
compensation
for
everything
they
were
about
to
subject
him
to
he
turned
back
again
immediately
as
soon
indeed
as
he
had
reached
the
door
and
addressing
the
king
said
i
was
forgetting
that
i
had
to
crave
your
majesty
s
in
what
respect
said
the
king
graciously
for
having
committed
a
serious
fault
without
perceiving
a
fault
you
ah
monsieur
fouquet
i
shall
be
unable
to
do
otherwise
than
forgive
you
in
what
way
or
against
whom
have
you
been
found
wanting
against
every
sense
of
propriety
sire
i
forgot
to
inform
your
majesty
of
a
circumstance
that
has
lately
occurred
of
some
little
what
is
it
colbert
trembled
he
fancied
that
he
was
about
to
frame
a
denunciation
against
him
his
conduct
had
been
unmasked
a
single
syllable
from
fouquet
a
single
proof
formally
advanced
and
before
the
youthful
loyalty
of
feeling
which
guided
louis
colbert
s
favor
would
disappear
at
once
the
latter
trembled
therefore
lest
so
daring
a
blow
might
overthrow
his
whole
scaffold
in
point
of
fact
the
opportunity
was
so
admirably
suited
to
be
taken
advantage
of
that
a
skillful
practiced
player
like
aramis
would
not
have
let
it
slip
sire
said
fouquet
with
an
easy
unconcerned
air
since
you
have
had
the
kindness
to
forgive
me
i
am
perfectly
indifferent
about
my
confession
this
morning
i
sold
one
of
the
official
appointments
i
one
of
your
appointments
said
the
king
which
colbert
turned
perfectly
livid
that
which
conferred
upon
me
sire
a
grand
gown
and
a
stern
air
of
gravity
the
appointment
of
the
king
involuntarily
uttered
a
loud
exclamation
and
looked
at
colbert
who
with
his
face
bedewed
with
perspiration
felt
almost
on
the
point
of
fainting
to
whom
have
you
sold
this
department
monsieur
fouquet
inquired
the
king
colbert
was
obliged
to
lean
against
a
column
of
the
fireplace
to
a
councilor
belonging
to
the
parliament
sire
whose
name
is
vanel
yes
sire
a
particular
friend
of
the
intendant
colbert
added
fouquet
letting
every
word
fall
from
his
lips
with
the
most
inimitable
nonchalance
and
with
an
admirably
assumed
expression
of
forgetfulness
and
ignorance
and
having
finished
and
having
overwhelmed
colbert
beneath
the
weight
of
this
superiority
the
superintendent
again
saluted
the
king
and
quitted
the
room
partially
revenged
by
the
stupefaction
of
the
king
and
the
humiliation
of
the
favorite
is
it
really
possible
said
the
king
as
soon
as
fouquet
had
disappeared
that
he
has
sold
that
office
yes
sire
said
colbert
meaningly
he
must
be
mad
the
king
added
colbert
this
time
did
not
reply
he
had
penetrated
the
king
s
thought
a
thought
which
amply
revenged
him
for
the
humiliation
he
had
just
been
made
to
suffer
his
hatred
was
augmented
by
a
feeling
of
bitter
jealousy
of
fouquet
and
a
threat
of
disgrace
was
now
added
to
the
plan
he
had
arranged
for
his
ruin
colbert
felt
perfectly
assured
that
for
the
future
between
louis
xiv
and
himself
their
hostile
feelings
and
ideas
would
meet
with
no
obstacles
and
that
at
the
first
fault
committed
by
fouquet
which
could
be
laid
hold
of
as
a
pretext
the
chastisement
so
long
impending
would
be
precipitated
fouquet
had
thrown
aside
his
weapons
of
defense
and
hate
and
jealousy
had
picked
them
up
colbert
was
invited
by
the
king
to
the
at
vaux
he
bowed
like
a
man
confident
in
himself
and
accepted
the
invitation
with
the
air
of
one
who
almost
confers
a
favor
the
king
was
about
writing
down
s
name
on
his
list
of
royal
commands
when
the
usher
announced
the
comte
de
as
soon
as
the
royal
mercury
entered
colbert
discreetly
withdrew
chapter
lvii
rivals
in
love
had
quitted
louis
xiv
hardly
a
couple
of
hours
before
but
in
the
first
effervescence
of
his
affection
whenever
louis
xiv
was
out
of
sight
of
la
valliere
he
was
obliged
to
talk
about
her
besides
the
only
person
with
whom
he
could
speak
about
her
at
his
ease
was
and
thus
had
become
an
indispensable
ah
is
that
you
comte
he
exclaimed
as
soon
as
he
perceived
him
doubly
delighted
not
only
to
see
him
again
but
also
to
get
rid
of
colbert
whose
scowling
face
always
put
him
out
of
humor
so
much
the
better
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
you
will
make
one
of
the
best
traveling
party
i
suppose
of
what
traveling
part
are
you
speaking
sire
inquired
the
one
we
are
making
up
to
go
to
the
the
superintendent
is
about
to
give
at
vaux
ah
you
will
at
last
see
a
a
royal
by
the
side
of
which
all
our
amusements
at
fontainebleau
are
petty
contemptible
at
vaux
the
superintendent
going
to
give
a
in
your
majesty
s
honor
nothing
more
than
that
nothing
more
than
that
do
you
say
it
is
very
diverting
to
find
you
treating
it
with
so
much
disdain
are
you
who
express
such
an
indifference
on
the
subject
aware
that
as
soon
as
it
is
known
that
fouquet
is
going
to
receive
me
at
vaux
next
sunday
week
people
will
be
striving
their
very
utmost
to
get
invited
to
the
i
repeat
you
shall
be
one
of
the
invited
very
well
sire
unless
i
shall
in
the
meantime
have
undertaken
a
longer
and
a
less
agreeable
what
journey
do
you
allude
to
the
one
across
the
styx
bah
said
louis
laughing
no
seriously
sire
replied
i
am
invited
and
in
such
a
way
in
truth
that
i
hardly
know
what
to
say
or
how
to
act
in
order
to
refuse
the
i
do
not
understand
you
i
know
that
you
are
in
a
poetical
vein
but
try
not
to
sink
from
apollo
to
very
well
if
your
majesty
will
deign
to
listen
to
me
i
will
not
keep
your
mind
on
the
rack
a
moment
your
majesty
knows
the
baron
du
vallon
yes
indeed
a
good
servant
to
my
father
the
late
king
and
an
admirable
companion
at
table
for
i
think
you
are
referring
to
the
gentleman
who
dined
with
us
at
fontainebleau
precisely
so
but
you
have
omitted
to
add
to
his
other
qualifications
sire
that
he
is
a
most
charming
of
other
what
does
du
vallon
wish
to
polish
you
off
or
to
get
me
killed
which
is
much
the
same
the
deuce
do
not
laugh
sire
for
i
am
not
saying
one
word
beyond
the
exact
and
you
say
he
wishes
to
get
you
such
is
that
excellent
person
s
present
be
easy
i
will
defend
you
if
he
be
in
the
ah
there
is
an
if
of
course
answer
me
as
candidly
as
if
it
were
some
one
else
s
affair
instead
of
your
own
my
poor
is
he
right
or
wrong
your
majesty
shall
be
the
what
have
you
done
to
him
to
him
personally
nothing
at
all
but
it
seems
to
one
of
his
friends
i
it
is
all
the
same
is
his
friend
one
of
the
celebrated
four
no
it
is
the
son
of
one
of
the
celebrated
four
what
have
you
done
to
the
son
come
tell
why
it
seems
that
i
have
helped
some
one
to
take
his
mistress
from
you
confess
it
then
i
can
not
help
confessing
it
for
it
is
in
that
case
you
are
wrong
and
if
he
were
to
kill
you
he
would
be
doing
perfectly
ah
that
is
your
majesty
s
way
of
reasoning
then
do
you
think
it
a
bad
way
it
is
a
very
expeditious
way
at
all
good
justice
is
prompt
so
my
grandfather
henry
iv
used
to
in
that
case
your
majesty
will
perhaps
be
good
enough
to
sign
my
adversary
s
pardon
for
he
is
now
waiting
for
me
at
the
minimes
for
the
purpose
of
putting
me
out
of
my
his
name
and
a
parchment
there
is
a
parchment
upon
your
majesty
s
table
and
for
his
name
well
what
is
it
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
the
vicomte
de
bragelonne
exclaimed
the
king
changing
from
a
fit
of
laughter
to
the
most
profound
stupor
and
then
after
a
moment
s
silence
while
he
wiped
his
forehead
which
was
bedewed
with
perspiration
he
again
murmured
bragelonne
no
other
bragelonne
who
was
affianced
to
yes
but
he
has
been
in
yes
but
i
can
assure
you
sire
he
is
there
no
is
he
in
paris
then
he
is
at
minimes
sire
where
he
is
waiting
for
me
as
i
have
already
had
the
honor
of
telling
does
he
know
all
yes
and
many
things
besides
perhaps
your
majesty
would
like
to
look
at
the
letter
i
have
received
from
him
and
drew
from
his
pocket
the
note
we
are
already
acquainted
with
when
your
majesty
has
read
the
letter
i
will
tell
you
how
it
reached
the
king
read
it
in
a
great
agitation
and
immediately
said
well
well
sire
your
majesty
knows
a
certain
carved
lock
closing
a
certain
door
of
carved
ebony
which
separates
a
certain
apartment
from
a
certain
blue
and
white
sanctuary
of
course
louise
s
yes
sire
well
it
was
in
the
keyhole
of
that
lock
that
i
found
yonder
who
placed
it
there
either
de
bragelonne
or
the
devil
himself
but
inasmuch
as
the
note
smells
of
musk
and
not
of
sulphur
i
conclude
that
it
must
be
not
the
devil
but
de
louis
bent
his
head
and
seemed
absorbed
in
sad
and
bitter
thought
perhaps
something
like
remorse
was
at
that
moment
passing
through
his
heart
the
secret
is
discovered
he
said
sire
i
shall
do
my
utmost
that
the
secret
dies
in
the
breast
of
the
man
who
possesses
it
said
in
a
tone
of
bravado
as
he
moved
towards
the
door
but
a
gesture
of
the
king
made
him
pause
where
are
you
going
he
inquired
where
they
await
me
what
for
to
fight
in
all
fight
exclaimed
the
king
one
moment
if
you
please
monsieur
le
comte
shook
his
head
as
a
rebellious
child
does
whenever
any
one
interferes
to
prevent
him
throwing
himself
into
a
well
or
playing
with
a
knife
but
sire
he
said
in
the
first
place
continued
the
king
i
want
to
be
enlightened
a
little
upon
all
points
if
your
majesty
will
be
pleased
to
interrogate
me
replied
i
will
throw
what
light
i
who
told
you
that
de
bragelonne
had
penetrated
into
that
room
the
letter
which
i
found
in
the
keyhole
told
who
told
you
that
it
was
de
bragelonne
who
put
it
there
who
but
himself
would
have
dared
to
undertake
such
a
mission
you
are
right
how
was
he
able
to
get
into
your
rooms
ah
that
is
very
serious
inasmuch
as
all
the
doors
were
closed
and
my
lackey
basque
had
the
keys
in
his
your
lackey
must
have
been
impossible
sire
for
if
he
had
been
bribed
those
who
did
so
would
not
have
sacrificed
the
poor
fellow
whom
it
is
not
unlikely
they
might
want
to
turn
to
further
use
by
and
by
in
showing
so
clearly
that
it
was
he
whom
they
had
made
use
quite
true
and
now
i
can
only
form
one
tell
me
what
it
is
sire
and
we
shall
see
if
it
is
the
same
that
has
presented
itself
to
my
that
he
effected
an
entrance
by
means
of
the
alas
sire
that
seems
to
me
more
than
there
is
no
doubt
that
some
one
must
have
sold
the
secret
of
the
either
sold
it
or
given
why
do
you
make
that
distinction
because
there
are
certain
persons
sire
who
being
above
the
price
of
treason
give
and
do
not
what
do
you
mean
oh
sire
your
majesty
s
mind
is
too
not
to
guess
what
i
mean
and
you
will
save
me
the
embarrassment
of
naming
the
person
i
allude
you
are
right
you
mean
madame
i
suppose
her
suspicions
were
aroused
by
your
changing
your
madame
has
keys
of
the
apartments
of
her
maids
of
honor
and
she
is
powerful
enough
to
discover
what
no
one
but
yourself
could
do
or
she
would
not
be
able
to
discover
and
you
suppose
then
that
my
sister
must
have
entered
into
an
alliance
with
bragelonne
and
has
informed
him
of
all
the
details
of
the
possibly
even
better
still
for
she
perhaps
accompanied
him
which
way
through
your
own
apartments
you
think
it
impossible
sire
well
listen
to
me
your
majesty
knows
that
madame
is
very
fond
of
perfumes
yes
she
acquired
that
taste
from
my
vervain
yes
it
is
the
scent
she
prefers
to
all
very
good
sire
my
apartments
happen
to
smell
very
strongly
of
the
king
remained
silent
and
thoughtful
for
a
few
moments
and
then
resumed
but
why
should
madame
take
bragelonne
s
part
against
me
could
very
easily
have
replied
a
woman
s
jealousy
the
king
probed
his
friend
to
the
bottom
of
his
heart
to
ascertain
if
he
had
learned
the
secret
of
his
flirtation
with
his
but
was
not
an
ordinary
courtier
he
did
not
lightly
run
the
risk
of
finding
out
family
secrets
and
he
was
too
a
friend
of
the
muses
not
to
think
very
frequently
of
poor
ovidius
naso
whose
eyes
shed
so
many
tears
in
expiation
of
his
crime
for
having
once
beheld
something
one
hardly
knows
what
in
the
palace
of
augustus
he
therefore
passed
by
madame
s
secret
very
skillfully
but
as
he
had
shown
no
ordinary
sagacity
in
indicating
madame
s
presence
in
his
rooms
in
company
with
bragelonne
it
was
necessary
of
course
for
him
to
repay
with
interest
the
king
s
and
reply
plainly
to
the
question
which
had
been
put
to
him
of
why
has
madame
taken
bragelonne
s
part
against
me
why
replied
your
majesty
forgets
i
presume
that
the
comte
de
guiche
is
the
intimate
friend
of
the
vicomte
de
i
do
not
see
the
connection
however
said
the
king
ah
i
beg
your
pardon
then
sire
but
i
thought
the
comte
de
guiche
was
a
very
great
friend
of
madame
quite
true
the
king
returned
there
is
no
occasion
to
search
any
further
the
blow
came
from
that
and
is
not
your
majesty
of
opinion
that
in
order
to
ward
it
off
it
will
be
necessary
to
deal
another
blow
yes
but
not
one
of
the
kind
given
in
the
bois
de
vincennes
replied
the
king
you
forget
sire
said
that
i
am
a
gentleman
and
that
i
have
been
the
challenge
neither
concerns
nor
was
it
intended
for
but
i
am
the
man
sire
who
has
been
expected
at
the
minimes
sire
during
the
last
hour
and
more
and
i
shall
be
dishonored
if
i
do
not
the
first
honor
and
duty
of
a
gentleman
is
obedience
to
his
sire
i
order
you
to
sire
obey
monsieur
as
your
majesty
besides
i
wish
to
have
the
whole
of
this
affair
explained
i
wish
to
know
how
it
is
that
i
have
been
so
insolently
trifled
with
as
to
have
the
sanctuary
of
my
affections
pried
into
it
is
not
you
whose
business
it
is
to
punish
those
who
have
acted
in
this
manner
for
it
is
not
your
honor
they
have
attacked
but
my
i
implore
your
majesty
not
to
overwhelm
de
bragelonne
with
your
wrath
for
although
in
the
whole
of
this
affair
he
may
have
shown
himself
deficient
in
prudence
he
has
not
been
so
in
his
feelings
of
enough
i
shall
know
how
to
decide
between
the
just
and
the
unjust
even
in
the
height
of
my
anger
but
take
care
that
not
a
word
of
this
is
breathed
to
but
what
am
i
to
do
with
regard
to
de
bragelonne
he
will
be
seeking
me
in
every
direction
and
i
shall
either
have
spoken
to
him
or
taken
care
that
he
has
been
spoken
to
before
the
evening
is
let
me
once
more
entreat
your
majesty
to
be
indulgent
towards
i
have
been
indulgent
long
enough
comte
said
louis
frowning
severely
it
is
now
quite
time
to
show
certain
persons
that
i
am
master
in
my
own
the
king
had
hardly
pronounced
these
words
which
betokened
that
a
fresh
feeling
of
irritation
was
mingling
with
the
recollections
of
old
when
an
usher
appeared
at
the
door
of
the
cabinet
what
is
the
matter
inquired
the
king
and
why
do
you
presume
to
come
when
i
have
not
summoned
you
sire
said
the
usher
your
majesty
desired
me
to
permit
le
comte
de
la
fere
to
pass
freely
on
any
and
every
occasion
when
he
might
wish
to
speak
to
your
well
monsieur
m
le
comte
de
la
fere
is
now
waiting
to
see
your
the
king
and
at
this
reply
exchanged
a
look
which
betrayed
more
uneasiness
than
surprise
louis
hesitated
for
a
moment
but
immediately
afterwards
seeming
to
make
up
his
mind
he
said
go
and
find
louise
inform
her
of
the
plot
against
us
do
not
let
her
be
ignorant
that
madame
will
return
to
her
system
of
persecutions
against
her
and
that
she
has
set
those
to
work
who
would
have
found
it
far
safer
to
remain
sire
if
louise
gets
nervous
and
frightened
reassure
her
as
much
as
you
can
tell
her
that
the
king
s
affection
is
an
impenetrable
shield
over
her
if
which
i
suspect
is
the
case
she
already
knows
everything
or
if
she
has
already
been
herself
subjected
to
an
attack
of
some
kind
or
other
from
any
quarter
tell
her
be
sure
to
tell
her
added
the
king
trembling
with
passion
tell
her
i
say
that
this
time
instead
of
defending
her
i
will
avenge
her
and
that
too
so
terribly
that
no
one
will
in
future
even
dare
to
raise
his
eyes
towards
is
that
all
sire
yes
all
go
as
quickly
as
you
can
and
remain
faithful
for
you
who
live
in
the
midst
of
this
stake
of
infernal
torments
have
not
like
myself
the
hope
of
the
paradise
beyond
exhausted
himself
in
protestations
of
devotion
took
the
king
s
hand
kissed
it
and
left
the
room
radiant
with
delight
chapter
lviii
king
and
noble
the
king
endeavored
to
recover
his
as
quickly
as
possible
in
order
to
meet
de
la
fere
with
an
untroubled
countenance
he
clearly
saw
it
was
not
mere
chance
that
had
induced
the
comte
s
visit
he
had
some
vague
impression
of
its
importance
but
he
felt
that
to
a
man
of
athos
s
tone
of
mind
to
one
of
such
a
high
order
of
intellect
his
first
reception
ought
not
to
present
anything
either
disagreeable
or
otherwise
than
kind
and
courteous
as
soon
as
the
king
had
satisfied
himself
that
as
far
as
appearances
went
he
was
perfectly
calm
again
he
gave
directions
to
the
ushers
to
introduce
the
comte
a
few
minutes
afterwards
athos
in
full
court
dress
and
with
his
breast
covered
with
the
orders
that
he
alone
had
the
right
to
wear
at
the
court
of
france
presented
himself
with
so
grave
and
solemn
an
air
that
the
king
perceived
at
the
first
glance
that
he
was
not
deceived
in
his
anticipations
louis
advanced
a
step
towards
the
comte
and
with
a
smile
held
out
his
hand
to
him
over
which
athos
bowed
with
the
air
of
the
deepest
respect
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
said
the
king
rapidly
you
are
so
seldom
here
that
it
is
a
real
piece
of
good
fortune
to
see
athos
bowed
and
replied
i
should
wish
always
to
enjoy
the
happiness
of
being
near
your
the
tone
however
in
which
this
reply
was
conveyed
evidently
signified
i
should
wish
to
be
one
of
your
majesty
s
advisers
to
save
you
the
commission
of
the
king
felt
it
so
and
determined
in
this
man
s
presence
to
preserve
all
the
advantages
which
could
be
derived
from
his
command
over
himself
as
well
as
from
his
rank
and
position
i
see
you
have
something
to
say
to
me
he
said
had
it
not
been
so
i
should
not
have
presumed
to
present
myself
before
your
speak
quickly
i
am
anxious
to
satisfy
you
returned
the
king
seating
himself
i
am
persuaded
replied
athos
in
a
somewhat
agitated
tone
of
voice
that
your
majesty
will
give
me
every
ah
said
the
king
with
a
certain
haughtiness
of
manner
you
have
come
to
lodge
a
complaint
here
then
it
would
be
a
complaint
returned
athos
only
in
the
event
of
your
majesty
but
if
you
will
deign
to
permit
me
sire
i
will
begin
the
conversation
from
the
very
do
so
i
am
your
majesty
will
remember
that
at
the
period
of
the
duke
of
buckingham
s
departure
i
had
the
honor
of
an
interview
with
at
or
about
that
period
i
think
i
remember
you
did
only
with
regard
to
the
subject
of
the
conversation
i
have
quite
forgotten
athos
started
as
he
replied
i
shall
have
the
honor
to
remind
your
majesty
of
it
it
was
with
regard
to
a
formal
demand
i
had
addressed
to
you
respecting
a
marriage
which
de
bragelonne
wished
to
contract
with
mademoiselle
de
la
ah
thought
the
king
we
have
come
to
it
i
remember
he
said
aloud
at
that
period
pursued
athos
your
majesty
was
so
kind
and
generous
towards
de
bragelonne
and
myself
that
not
a
single
word
which
then
fell
from
your
lips
has
escaped
my
memory
and
when
i
asked
your
majesty
to
accord
me
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
hand
for
de
bragelonne
you
quite
true
said
louis
dryly
alleging
athos
hastened
to
say
that
the
young
lady
had
no
position
in
louis
could
hardly
force
himself
to
listen
with
an
appearance
of
royal
propriety
that
added
athos
she
had
but
little
the
king
threw
himself
back
in
his
armchair
that
her
extraction
was
a
renewed
impatience
on
the
part
of
the
king
and
little
beauty
added
athos
pitilessly
this
last
bolt
buried
itself
deep
in
the
king
s
heart
and
made
him
almost
bound
from
his
seat
you
have
a
good
memory
monsieur
he
said
i
invariably
have
on
occasions
when
i
have
had
the
distinguished
honor
of
an
interview
with
your
majesty
retorted
the
comte
without
being
in
the
least
disconcerted
very
good
it
is
admitted
that
i
said
all
and
i
thanked
your
majesty
for
your
remarks
at
the
time
because
they
testified
an
interest
in
de
bragelonne
which
did
him
much
and
you
may
possibly
remember
said
the
king
very
deliberately
that
you
had
the
greatest
repugnance
for
this
quite
true
and
that
you
solicited
my
permission
much
against
your
own
inclination
yes
and
finally
i
remember
for
i
have
a
memory
nearly
as
good
as
your
own
i
remember
i
say
that
you
observed
at
the
time
i
do
not
believe
that
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
loves
de
is
that
true
the
blow
told
well
but
athos
did
not
draw
back
sire
he
said
i
have
already
begged
your
majesty
s
forgiveness
but
there
are
certain
particulars
in
that
conversation
which
are
only
intelligible
from
the
well
what
is
the
monsieur
this
that
your
majesty
then
said
that
you
would
defer
the
marriage
out
of
regard
for
de
bragelonne
s
own
the
king
remained
silent
m
de
bragelonne
is
now
so
exceedingly
unhappy
that
he
can
not
any
longer
defer
asking
your
majesty
for
a
solution
of
the
the
king
turned
pale
athos
looked
at
him
with
fixed
attention
and
what
said
the
king
with
considerable
hesitation
does
de
bragelonne
request
precisely
the
very
thing
that
i
came
to
ask
your
majesty
for
at
my
last
audience
namely
your
majesty
s
consent
to
his
the
king
remained
perfectly
silent
the
questions
which
referred
to
the
different
obstacles
in
the
way
are
all
now
quite
removed
for
us
continued
athos
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
without
fortune
birth
or
beauty
is
not
the
less
on
that
account
the
only
good
match
in
the
world
for
de
bragelonne
since
he
loves
this
young
the
king
pressed
his
hands
impatiently
together
does
your
majesty
hesitate
inquired
the
comte
without
losing
a
particle
of
either
his
firmness
of
his
politeness
i
do
not
hesitate
i
refuse
replied
the
king
athos
paused
a
moment
as
if
to
collect
himself
i
have
had
the
honor
he
said
in
a
mild
tone
to
observe
to
your
majesty
that
no
obstacle
now
interferes
with
de
bragelonne
s
affections
and
that
his
determination
seems
there
is
my
will
and
that
is
an
obstacle
i
should
imagine
that
is
the
most
serious
of
all
athos
replied
quickly
ah
and
may
we
therefore
be
permitted
to
ask
your
majesty
with
the
greatest
humility
your
reason
for
this
refusal
the
reason
a
question
to
me
exclaimed
the
king
a
demand
sire
the
king
leaning
with
both
his
hands
upon
the
table
said
in
a
deep
tone
of
concentrated
passion
you
have
lost
all
recollection
of
what
is
usual
at
court
at
court
please
to
remember
no
one
ventures
to
put
a
question
to
the
very
true
sire
but
if
men
do
not
question
they
conjecture
what
may
that
mean
monsieur
very
frequently
sire
conjecture
with
regard
to
a
particular
subject
implies
a
want
of
frankness
on
the
part
of
the
king
monsieur
and
a
want
of
confidence
on
the
part
of
the
subject
pursued
athos
intrepidly
you
forget
yourself
said
the
king
hurried
away
by
anger
in
spite
of
all
his
sire
i
am
obliged
to
seek
elsewhere
for
what
i
thought
i
should
find
in
your
majesty
instead
of
obtaining
a
reply
from
you
i
am
compelled
to
make
one
for
the
king
rose
monsieur
le
comte
he
said
i
have
now
given
you
all
the
time
i
had
at
my
this
was
a
dismissal
sire
replied
the
comte
i
have
not
yet
had
time
to
tell
your
majesty
what
i
came
with
the
express
object
of
saying
and
i
so
rarely
see
your
majesty
that
i
ought
to
avail
myself
of
the
just
now
you
spoke
rudely
of
conjectures
you
are
now
becoming
offensive
oh
sire
offend
your
majesty
i
never
all
my
life
through
i
have
maintained
that
kings
are
above
all
other
men
not
only
from
their
rank
and
power
but
from
their
nobleness
of
heart
and
their
true
dignity
of
mind
i
never
can
bring
myself
to
believe
that
my
sovereign
he
who
passed
his
word
to
me
did
so
with
a
mental
what
do
you
mean
what
mental
reservation
do
you
allude
to
i
will
explain
my
meaning
said
athos
coldly
if
in
refusing
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
to
monsieur
de
bragelonne
your
majesty
had
some
other
object
in
view
than
the
happiness
and
fortune
of
the
vicomte
you
perceive
monsieur
that
you
are
offending
if
in
requiring
the
vicomte
to
delay
his
marriage
your
majesty
s
only
object
was
to
remove
the
gentleman
to
whom
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
was
engaged
monsieur
monsieur
i
have
heard
it
said
so
in
every
direction
sire
your
majesty
s
affection
for
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
is
spoken
of
on
all
the
king
tore
his
gloves
which
he
had
been
biting
for
some
time
woe
to
those
he
cried
who
interfere
in
my
affairs
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
take
a
particular
course
and
i
will
break
through
every
obstacle
in
my
what
obstacle
said
athos
the
king
stopped
short
like
a
horse
which
having
taken
the
bit
between
his
teeth
and
run
away
finds
it
has
slipped
it
back
again
and
that
his
career
is
checked
i
love
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
he
said
suddenly
with
mingled
nobleness
of
feeling
and
passion
but
interrupted
athos
that
does
not
preclude
your
majesty
from
allowing
de
bragelonne
to
marry
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
the
sacrifice
is
worthy
of
so
great
a
monarch
it
is
fully
merited
by
de
bragelonne
who
has
already
rendered
great
service
to
your
majesty
and
who
may
well
be
regarded
as
a
brave
and
worthy
man
your
majesty
therefore
in
renouncing
the
affection
you
entertain
offers
a
proof
at
once
of
generosity
gratitude
and
good
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
does
not
love
de
bragelonne
said
the
king
hoarsely
does
your
majesty
know
that
to
be
the
case
remarked
athos
with
a
searching
look
i
do
know
since
a
very
short
time
then
for
doubtless
had
your
majesty
known
it
when
i
first
preferred
my
request
you
would
have
taken
the
trouble
to
inform
me
of
since
a
very
short
time
it
is
true
athos
remained
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
resumed
in
that
case
i
do
not
understand
why
your
majesty
should
have
sent
de
bragelonne
to
london
that
exile
and
most
properly
so
too
is
a
matter
of
astonishment
to
every
one
who
regards
your
majesty
s
honor
with
sincere
who
presumes
to
impugn
my
honor
monsieur
de
la
fere
the
king
s
honor
sire
is
made
up
of
the
honor
of
his
whole
nobility
whenever
the
king
offends
one
of
his
gentlemen
that
is
whenever
he
deprives
him
of
the
smallest
particle
of
his
honor
it
is
from
him
from
the
king
himself
that
that
portion
of
honor
is
monsieur
de
la
fere
said
the
king
haughtily
sire
you
sent
de
bragelonne
to
london
either
before
you
were
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
s
lover
or
since
you
have
become
the
king
irritated
beyond
measure
especially
because
he
felt
that
he
was
being
mastered
endeavored
to
dismiss
athos
by
a
gesture
sire
replied
the
comte
i
will
tell
you
all
i
will
not
leave
your
presence
until
i
have
been
satisfied
by
your
majesty
or
by
myself
satisfied
if
you
prove
to
me
that
you
are
right
satisfied
if
i
prove
to
you
that
you
are
wrong
nay
sire
you
can
but
listen
to
me
i
am
old
now
and
i
am
attached
to
everything
that
is
really
great
and
really
powerful
in
your
kingdom
i
am
of
those
who
have
shed
their
blood
for
your
father
and
for
yourself
without
ever
having
asked
a
single
favor
either
from
yourself
or
from
your
father
i
have
never
inflicted
the
slightest
wrong
or
injury
on
any
one
in
this
world
and
even
kings
are
still
my
debtors
you
can
but
listen
to
me
i
repeat
i
have
come
to
ask
you
for
an
account
of
the
honor
of
one
of
your
servants
whom
you
have
deceived
by
a
falsehood
or
betrayed
by
want
of
heart
of
judgment
i
know
that
these
words
irritate
your
majesty
but
the
facts
themselves
are
killing
us
i
know
that
you
are
endeavoring
to
find
some
means
whereby
to
chastise
me
for
my
frankness
but
i
know
also
the
chastisement
i
will
implore
god
to
inflict
upon
you
when
i
relate
to
him
your
perjury
and
my
son
s
the
king
during
these
remarks
was
walking
hurriedly
to
and
fro
his
hand
thrust
into
the
breast
of
his
coat
his
head
haughtily
raised
his
eyes
blazing
with
wrath
monsieur
he
cried
suddenly
if
i
acted
towards
you
as
a
king
you
would
be
already
punished
but
i
am
only
a
man
and
i
have
the
right
to
love
in
this
world
every
one
who
loves
me
a
happiness
which
is
so
rarely
you
can
not
pretend
to
such
a
right
as
a
man
any
more
than
as
a
king
sire
or
if
you
intend
to
exercise
that
right
in
a
loyal
manner
you
should
have
told
de
bragelonne
so
and
not
have
exiled
it
is
too
great
a
condescension
monsieur
to
discuss
these
things
with
you
interrupted
louis
with
that
majesty
of
air
and
manner
he
alone
seemed
able
to
give
his
look
and
his
voice
i
was
hoping
that
you
would
reply
to
me
said
the
comte
you
shall
know
my
reply
you
already
know
my
thoughts
on
the
subject
was
the
comte
de
la
fere
s
answer
you
have
forgotten
you
are
speaking
to
the
king
monsieur
it
is
a
you
have
forgotten
you
are
destroying
the
lives
of
two
men
sire
it
is
a
mortal
leave
the
room
not
until
i
have
said
this
son
of
louis
you
begin
your
reign
badly
for
you
begin
it
by
abduction
and
disloyalty
my
race
myself
too
are
now
freed
from
all
that
affection
and
respect
towards
you
which
i
made
my
son
swear
to
observe
in
the
vaults
of
in
the
presence
of
the
relics
of
your
noble
forefathers
you
are
now
become
our
enemy
sire
and
henceforth
we
have
nothing
to
do
save
with
heaven
alone
our
sole
master
be
warned
be
warned
what
do
you
threaten
oh
no
said
athos
sadly
i
have
as
little
bravado
as
fear
in
my
soul
the
god
of
whom
i
spoke
to
you
is
now
listening
to
me
he
knows
that
for
the
safety
and
honor
of
your
crown
i
would
even
yet
shed
every
drop
of
blood
twenty
years
of
civil
and
foreign
warfare
have
left
in
my
veins
i
can
well
say
then
that
i
threaten
the
king
as
little
as
i
threaten
the
man
but
i
tell
you
sire
you
lose
two
servants
for
you
have
destroyed
faith
in
the
heart
of
the
father
and
love
in
the
heart
of
the
son
the
one
ceases
to
believe
in
the
royal
word
the
other
no
longer
believes
in
the
loyalty
of
the
man
or
the
purity
of
woman
the
one
is
dead
to
every
feeling
of
respect
the
other
to
obedience
adieu
thus
saying
athos
broke
his
sword
across
his
knee
slowly
placed
the
two
pieces
upon
the
floor
and
saluting
the
king
who
was
almost
choking
from
rage
and
shame
he
quitted
the
cabinet
louis
who
sat
near
the
table
completely
overwhelmed
was
several
minutes
before
he
could
collect
himself
but
he
suddenly
rose
and
rang
the
bell
violently
tell
d
artagnan
to
come
here
he
said
to
the
terrified
ushers
chapter
lix
after
the
storm
our
readers
will
doubtlessly
have
been
asking
themselves
how
it
happened
that
athos
of
whom
not
a
word
has
been
said
for
some
time
past
arrived
so
very
opportunely
at
court
we
will
without
delay
endeavor
to
satisfy
their
curiosity
porthos
faithful
to
his
duty
as
an
arranger
of
affairs
had
immediately
after
leaving
the
palais
royal
set
off
to
join
raoul
at
the
minimes
in
the
bois
de
vincennes
and
had
related
everything
even
to
the
smallest
details
which
had
passed
between
and
himself
he
finished
by
saying
that
the
message
which
the
king
had
sent
to
his
favorite
would
probably
not
occasion
more
than
a
short
delay
and
that
as
soon
as
he
could
leave
the
king
would
not
lose
a
moment
in
accepting
the
invitation
raoul
had
sent
him
but
raoul
less
credulous
than
his
old
friend
had
concluded
from
porthos
s
recital
that
if
was
going
to
the
king
would
tell
the
king
everything
and
that
the
king
would
most
assuredly
forbid
to
obey
the
summons
he
had
received
to
the
hostile
meeting
the
consequence
of
his
reflections
was
that
he
had
left
porthos
to
remain
at
the
place
appointed
for
the
meeting
in
the
very
improbable
case
that
would
come
there
having
endeavored
to
make
porthos
promise
that
he
would
not
remain
there
more
than
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
at
the
very
longest
porthos
however
formally
refused
to
do
anything
of
the
kind
but
on
the
contrary
installed
himself
in
the
minimes
as
if
he
were
going
to
take
root
there
making
raoul
promise
that
when
he
had
been
to
see
his
father
he
would
return
to
his
own
apartments
in
order
that
porthos
s
servant
might
know
where
to
find
him
in
case
de
should
happen
to
come
to
the
rendezvous
bragelonne
had
left
vincennes
and
proceeded
at
once
straight
to
the
apartments
of
athos
who
had
been
in
paris
during
the
last
two
days
the
comte
having
been
already
informed
of
what
had
taken
place
by
a
letter
from
d
artagnan
raoul
arrived
at
his
father
s
athos
after
having
held
out
his
hand
to
him
and
embraced
him
most
affectionately
made
a
sign
for
him
to
sit
down
i
know
you
come
to
me
as
a
man
would
go
to
a
friend
vicomte
whenever
he
is
suffering
tell
me
therefore
what
is
it
that
brings
you
the
young
man
bowed
and
began
his
recital
more
than
once
in
the
course
of
it
his
tears
almost
choked
his
utterance
and
a
sob
checked
in
his
throat
compelled
him
to
suspend
his
narrative
for
a
few
minutes
athos
most
probably
already
knew
how
matters
stood
as
we
have
just
now
said
d
artagnan
had
already
written
to
him
but
preserving
until
the
conclusion
that
calm
unruffled
composure
of
manner
which
constituted
the
almost
superhuman
side
of
his
character
he
replied
raoul
i
do
not
believe
there
is
a
word
of
truth
in
these
rumors
i
do
not
believe
in
the
existence
of
what
you
fear
although
i
do
not
deny
that
persons
best
entitled
to
the
fullest
credit
have
already
conversed
with
me
on
the
subject
in
my
heart
and
soul
i
think
it
utterly
impossible
that
the
king
could
be
guilty
of
such
an
outrage
on
a
gentleman
i
will
answer
for
the
king
therefore
and
will
soon
bring
you
back
the
proof
of
what
i
raoul
wavering
like
a
drunken
man
between
what
he
had
seen
with
his
own
eyes
and
the
imperturbable
faith
he
had
in
a
man
who
had
never
told
a
falsehood
bowed
and
simply
answered
go
then
monsieur
le
comte
i
will
await
your
and
he
sat
down
burying
his
face
in
his
hands
athos
dressed
and
then
left
him
in
order
to
wait
upon
the
king
the
result
of
that
interview
is
already
known
to
our
readers
when
he
returned
to
his
lodgings
raoul
pale
and
dejected
had
not
quitted
his
attitude
of
despair
at
the
sound
however
of
the
opening
doors
and
of
his
father
s
footsteps
as
he
approached
him
the
young
man
raised
his
head
athos
s
face
was
very
pale
his
head
uncovered
and
his
manner
full
of
seriousness
he
gave
his
cloak
and
hat
to
the
lackey
dismissed
him
with
a
gesture
and
sat
down
near
raoul
well
monsieur
inquired
the
young
man
are
you
convinced
yet
i
am
raoul
the
king
loves
mademoiselle
de
la
he
confesses
it
then
cried
raoul
yes
replied
athos
and
she
i
have
not
seen
no
but
the
king
spoke
to
you
about
her
what
did
he
say
he
says
that
she
loves
oh
you
see
you
see
monsieur
said
the
young
man
with
a
gesture
of
despair
raoul
resumed
the
comte
i
told
the
king
believe
me
all
that
you
yourself
could
possibly
have
urged
and
i
believe
i
did
so
in
becoming
language
though
sufficiently
and
what
did
you
say
to
him
monsieur
i
told
him
raoul
that
everything
was
now
at
an
end
between
him
and
ourselves
that
you
would
never
serve
him
again
i
told
him
that
i
too
should
remain
aloof
nothing
further
remains
for
me
then
but
to
be
satisfied
of
one
what
is
that
monsieur
whether
you
have
determined
to
adopt
any
any
steps
regarding
what
with
reference
to
your
disappointed
affection
and
your
ideas
of
oh
monsieur
with
regard
to
my
affection
i
shall
perhaps
some
day
or
other
succeed
in
tearing
it
from
my
heart
i
trust
i
shall
do
so
aided
by
heaven
s
merciful
help
and
your
own
wise
exhortations
as
far
as
vengeance
is
concerned
it
occurred
to
me
only
when
under
the
influence
of
an
evil
thought
for
i
could
not
revenge
myself
upon
the
one
who
is
actually
guilty
i
have
therefore
already
renounced
every
idea
of
and
you
no
longer
think
of
seeking
a
quarrel
with
de
no
monsieur
i
sent
him
a
challenge
if
de
accepts
it
i
will
maintain
it
if
he
does
not
take
it
up
i
will
leave
things
as
they
and
la
valliere
you
can
not
i
know
have
seriously
thought
that
i
should
dream
of
revenging
myself
upon
a
woman
replied
raoul
with
a
smile
so
sad
that
a
tear
started
even
to
the
eyes
of
his
father
who
had
so
many
times
in
the
course
of
his
life
bowed
beneath
his
own
sorrows
and
those
of
others
he
held
out
his
hand
to
raoul
which
the
latter
seized
most
eagerly
and
so
monsieur
le
comte
you
are
quite
satisfied
that
the
misfortune
is
one
beyond
all
remedy
inquired
the
young
man
poor
boy
he
murmured
you
think
that
i
still
live
in
hope
said
raoul
and
you
pity
me
oh
it
is
indeed
horrible
suffering
for
me
to
despise
as
i
am
bound
to
do
the
one
i
have
loved
so
devotedly
if
i
had
but
some
real
cause
of
complaint
against
her
i
should
be
happy
i
should
be
able
to
forgive
athos
looked
at
his
son
with
a
profoundly
sorrowful
air
for
the
words
raoul
had
just
pronounced
seemed
to
have
issued
out
of
his
own
heart
at
this
moment
the
servant
announced
d
artagnan
this
name
sounded
very
differently
to
the
ears
of
athos
and
raoul
the
musketeer
entered
the
room
with
a
vague
smile
on
his
lips
raoul
paused
athos
walked
towards
his
friend
with
an
expression
of
face
that
did
not
escape
bragelonne
d
artagnan
answered
athos
s
look
by
an
imperceptible
movement
of
the
eyelid
and
then
advancing
towards
raoul
whom
he
took
by
the
hand
he
said
addressing
both
father
and
son
well
you
are
trying
to
console
this
poor
boy
it
and
you
kind
and
good
as
usual
have
come
to
help
me
in
my
difficult
as
he
said
this
athos
pressed
d
artagnan
s
hand
between
both
his
own
raoul
fancied
he
observed
in
this
pressure
something
beyond
the
sense
his
mere
words
conveyed
yes
replied
the
musketeer
smoothing
his
mustache
with
the
hand
that
athos
had
left
free
yes
i
have
come
you
are
most
welcome
chevalier
not
for
the
consolation
you
bring
with
you
but
on
your
own
account
i
am
already
consoled
said
raoul
and
he
attempted
to
smile
but
the
effort
was
more
sad
than
any
tears
d
artagnan
had
ever
seen
shed
that
is
all
well
and
good
then
said
d
artagnan
only
continued
raoul
you
have
arrived
just
as
the
comte
was
about
to
give
me
the
details
of
his
interview
with
the
king
you
will
allow
the
comte
to
continue
added
the
young
man
as
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
musketeer
he
seemed
to
read
the
very
depths
of
his
heart
his
interview
with
the
king
said
d
artagnan
in
a
tone
so
natural
and
unassumed
that
there
was
no
means
of
suspecting
that
his
astonishment
was
feigned
you
have
seen
the
king
then
athos
athos
smiled
as
he
said
yes
i
have
seen
ah
indeed
you
were
unaware
then
that
the
comte
had
seen
his
majesty
inquired
raoul
half
reassured
yes
indeed
quite
in
that
case
i
am
less
uneasy
said
raoul
uneasy
and
about
what
inquired
athos
forgive
me
monsieur
said
raoul
but
knowing
so
well
the
regard
and
affection
you
have
for
me
i
was
afraid
you
might
possibly
have
expressed
somewhat
plainly
to
his
majesty
my
own
sufferings
and
your
indignation
and
that
the
king
had
consequently
and
that
the
king
had
consequently
repeated
d
artagnan
well
go
on
finish
what
you
were
going
to
i
have
now
to
ask
you
to
forgive
me
monsieur
d
artagnan
said
raoul
for
a
moment
and
i
can
not
help
confessing
it
i
trembled
lest
you
had
come
here
not
as
d
artagnan
but
as
captain
of
the
you
are
mad
my
poor
boy
cried
d
artagnan
with
a
burst
of
laughter
in
which
an
exact
observer
might
perhaps
have
wished
to
have
heard
a
little
more
frankness
so
much
the
better
said
raoul
yes
mad
and
do
you
know
what
i
would
advise
you
to
do
tell
me
monsieur
for
the
advice
is
sure
to
be
good
as
it
comes
from
very
good
then
i
advise
you
after
your
long
journey
from
england
after
your
visit
to
de
guiche
after
your
visit
to
madame
after
your
visit
to
porthos
after
your
journey
to
vincennes
i
advise
you
i
say
to
take
a
few
hours
rest
go
and
lie
down
sleep
for
a
dozen
hours
and
when
you
wake
up
go
and
ride
one
of
my
horses
until
you
have
tired
him
to
and
drawing
raoul
towards
him
he
embraced
him
as
he
would
have
done
his
own
child
athos
did
the
like
only
it
was
very
visible
that
the
kiss
was
still
more
affectionate
and
the
pressure
of
his
lips
even
warmer
with
the
father
than
with
the
friend
the
young
man
again
looked
at
both
his
companions
endeavoring
to
penetrate
their
real
meaning
or
their
real
feelings
with
the
utmost
strength
of
his
intelligence
but
his
look
was
powerless
upon
the
smiling
countenance
of
the
musketeer
or
upon
the
calm
and
composed
features
of
the
comte
de
la
fere
where
are
you
going
raoul
inquired
the
latter
seeing
that
bragelonne

preparing
to
go
out
to
my
own
apartments
replied
the
latter
in
his
soft
sad
voice
we
shall
be
sure
to
find
you
there
then
if
we
should
have
anything
to
say
to
you
yes
monsieur
but
do
you
suppose
it
likely
you
will
have
something
to
say
to
me
how
can
i
tell

yes
something
fresh
to
console
you

pushing
him
towards
the
door
raoul
observing
the
perfect
composure
which
marked
every
gesture
of
his
two
friends
quitted
the
comte
s
room
carrying
away
with
him
nothing
but
the
individual
feeling
of
his
own
particular
distress
thank
heaven
he
said
since
that
is
the
case
i
need
only
think
of
and
wrapping
himself
up
in
his
cloak
in
order
to
conceal
from
the
in
the
streets
his
gloomy
and
sorrowful
face
he
quitted
them
for
the
purpose
of
returning
to
his
own
rooms
as
he
had
promised
porthos
the
two
friends
watched
the
young
man
as
he
walked
away
with
a
feeling
of
genuine
disinterested
pity
only
each
expressed
it
in
a
different
way
poor
raoul
said

sighing
deeply
poor
raoul

shrugging
his
shoulders
chapter
lx
heu

poor
raoul
had
said
athos
poor
raoul
had
said
d
artagnan
and
in
point
of
fact
to
be
pitied
by
both
these
men
raoul
must
indeed
have
been
most
unhappy
and
therefore
when
he
found
himself
alone
face
to
face
as
it
were
with
his
own
troubles
leaving
behind
him
the
intrepid
friend
and
the
indulgent
father
when
he
recalled
the
avowal
of
the
king
s
affection
which
had
robbed
him
of
louise
de
la
valliere
whom
he
loved
so
deeply
he
felt
his
heart
almost
breaking
as
indeed
we
all
have
at
least
once
in
our
lives
at
the
first
illusion
destroyed
the
first
affection
betrayed
oh
he
murmured
all
is
over
then
nothing
is
now
left
me
in
this
world
nothing
to
look
forward
to
nothing
to
hope
for
guiche
has
told
me
so
my
father
has
told
me
so
d
artagnan
has
told
me
so
all
life
is
but
an
idle
dream
the
future
which
i
have
been
hopelessly
pursuing
for
the
last
ten
years
is
a
dream
the
union
of
hearts
a
dream
a
life
of
love
and
happiness
a
dream
poor
fool
that
i
am
he
continued
after
a
pause
to
dream
away
my
existence
aloud
publicly
and
in
the
face
of
others
friends
and
enemies
and
for
what
purpose
too
in
order
that
my
friends
may
be
saddened
by
my
troubles
and
my
enemies
may
laugh
at
my
sorrows
and
so
my
unhappiness
will
soon
become
a
notorious
disgrace
a
public
scandal
and
who
knows
but
that
i
may
even
be
a
public
and
despite
the
composure
which
he
had
promised
his
father
and
d
artagnan
to
observe
raoul
could
not
resist
uttering
a
few
words
of
darkest
menace
and
yet
he
continued
if
my
name
were
de
wardes
and
if
i
had
the
pliancy
of
character
and
strength
of
will
of
d
artagnan
i
should
laugh
with
my
lips
at
least
i
should
convince
other
women
that
this
perfidious
girl
honored
by
the
affection
i
have
wasted
on
her
leaves
me
only
one
regret
that
of
having
been
abused
and
deceived
by
her
seemingly
modest
and
irreproachable
conduct
a
few
might
perhaps
fawn
on
the
king
by
jesting
at
my
expense
i
should
put
myself
on
the
track
of
some
of
those
buffoons
i
should
chastise
a
few
of
them
perhaps
the
men
would
fear
me
and
by
the
time
i
had
laid
three
dying
or
dead
at
my
feet
i
should
be
adored
by
the
women
yes
yes
that
indeed
would
be
the
proper
course
to
adopt
and
the
comte
de
la

himself
would
not
object
to
it
has
not
he
also
been
tried
in
his
earlier
days
in
the
same
manner
as
i
have
just
been
tried
myself
did
he
not
replace
affection
by
intoxication
he
has
often
told
me
so
why
should
i
not
replace
love
by
pleasure
he
must
have
suffered
as
much
as
i
suffer
even
more
if
that
is
possible
the
history
of
one
man
is
the
history
of
all
a
dragging
trial
more
or
less
prolonged
more
or
less
bitter
sorrowful
the
note
of
human
nature
is
nothing
but
one

but
what
are
the
sufferings
of
others
compared
to
those
from
which
i

went
on

has
my

been
up

the

a
cold

sterile

in

and
what
is
honor
after
all
a
theory
which
every
man
understands
in
his
own
way
my
father
tells
me
honor
is
the
consideration
of

is

and
particularly
what
is

honor

of

as
that

the

will

during

the
most
angelic
portion
of
our
existence
hand
in
hand
along
the
charming
path
of
life
covered
with
the
blossoms
of
youth
and
then
alas
we
reach
a
where
she
separates
herself
from
me
in
which
we
have
to
follow
a
different
route
whereby
we
become
more
and
more
widely
separated
from
each
other
and
to
attain
the
end
of
this
path
oh
heaven
i
am
now
alone
in
utter
despair
and
crushed
to
the
very
such
were
the
sinister
reflections
in
which
raoul
indulged
when
his
foot
mechanically
paused
at
the
door
of
his
own
dwelling
he
had
reached
it
without
remarking
the
streets
through
which
he
passed
without
knowing
how
he
had
come
he
pushed
open
the
door
continued
to
advance
and
ascended
the
staircase
the
staircase
as
in
most
of
the
houses
at
that
period
was
very
dark
and
the
landings
most
obscure
raoul
lived
on
the
first
floor
he
paused
in
order
to
ring
olivain
appeared
took
his
sword
and
cloak
from
his
hands
raoul
himself
opened
the
door
which
from
the
led
into
a
small
richly
furnished
enough
for
the
of
a
young
man
and
completely
filled
with
flowers
by
olivain
who
knowing
his
master
s
tastes
had
shown
himself
studiously
attentive
in
gratifying
them
without
caring
whether
his
master
perceived
his
attention
or
not
there
was
a
portrait
of
la
valliere
in
the
which
had
been
drawn
by
herself
and
given
by
her
to
raoul
this
portrait
fastened
above
a
large
easy
chair
covered
with
dark
colored
damask
was
the
first
point
towards
which
raoul
bent
his
steps
the
first
object
on
which
he
fixed
his
eyes
it
was
moreover
raoul
s
usual
habit
to
do
so
every
time
he
entered
his
room
this
portrait
before
anything
else
attracted
his
attention
this
time
as
usual
he
walked
straight
up
to
the
portrait
placed
his
knees
upon
the
arm
chair
and
paused
to
look
at
it
sadly
his
arms
were
crossed
upon
his
breast
his
head
slightly
thrown
back
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
his
mouth
worked
into
a
bitter
smile
he
looked
at
the
portrait
of
the
one
he
had
so
tenderly
loved
and
then
all
that
he
had
said
passed
before
his
mind
again
all
that
he
had
suffered
seemed
again
to
assail
his
heart
and
after
a
long
silence
he
murmured
for
the
third
time
miserable
unhappy
wretch
that
i
am
he
had
hardly
pronounced
these
words
when
he
heard
the
sound
of
a
sigh
and
a
groan
behind
him
he
turned
sharply
round
and
perceived
in
the
angle
of
the
standing
up
a
bending
veiled
female
figure
which
he
had
been
the
means
of
concealing
behind
the
door
as
he
opened
it
and
which
he
had
not
perceived
as
he
entered
he
advanced
towards
the
figure
whose
presence
in
his
room
had
not
been
announced
to
him
and
as
he
bowed
and
inquired
at
the
same
moment
who
she
was
she
suddenly
raised
her
head
and
removed
the
veil
from
her
face
revealing
her
pale
and
features
raoul
staggered
back
as
if
he
had
seen
a
ghost
louise
he
cried
in
a
tone
of
such
absolute
despair
one
could
hardly
have
thought
the
human
voice
was
capable
of
so
desponding
a
cry
without
the
snapping
of
the
human
heart

mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
for
it
was
indeed
she
advanced
a
few
steps
towards
him
yes
louise
she
murmured
but
this
interval
short
as
it
had
been
was
quite
sufficient
for
raoul
to
recover
himself
you
mademoiselle
he
said
and
then
added
in
an
indefinable
tone
you
here
yes
raoul
the
young
girl
replied
i
have
been
waiting
for
i
beg
your
pardon
when
i
came
into
the
room
i
was
not
aware
i
know
but
i
entreated
olivain
not
to
tell
you
she
hesitated
and
as
raoul
did
not
attempt
to
interrupt
her
a
moment
s
silence
ensued
during
which
the
sound
of
their
throbbing
hearts
might
have
been
heard
not
in
unison
with
each
other
but
the
one
beating
as
violently
as
the
other
it
was
for
louise
to
speak
and
she
made
an
effort
to
do
so
i
wished
to
speak
to
you
she
said
it
was
absolutely
necessary
that
i
should
see
you
myself
alone
i
have
not
hesitated
to
adopt
a
step
which
must
remain
secret
for
no
one
except
yourself
could
understand
my
motive
monsieur
de
in
fact
mademoiselle
raoul
stammered
out
almost
breathless
from
emotion
as
far
as
i
am
concerned
and
despite
the
good
opinion
you
have
of
me
i
confess
will
you
do
me
the
great
kindness
to
sit
down
and
listen
to
me
said
louise
interrupting
him
with
her
soft
sweet
voice
bragelonne
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
then
mournfully
shaking
his
head
he
sat
or
rather
fell
down
on
a
chair
speak
he
said
she
cast
a
glance
all
round
her
this
look
was
a
timid
entreaty
and
implored
secrecy
far
more
effectually
than
her
expressed
words
had
done
a
few
minutes
before
raoul
rouse
and
went
to
the
door
which
he
opened
olivain
he
said
i
am
not
within
for
any
and
then
turning
towards
louise
he
added
is
not
that
what
you
wished
nothing
could
have
produced
a
greater
effect
upon
louise
than
these
few
words
which
seemed
to
signify
you
see
that
i
still
understand
she
passed
a
handkerchief
across
her
eyes
in
order
to
remove
a
rebellious
tear
which
she
could
not
restrain
and
then
having
collected
herself
for
a
moment
she
said
raoul
do
not
turn
your
kind
frank
look
away
from
me
you
are
not
one
of
those
men
who
despise
a
woman
for
having
given
her
heart
to
another
even
though
her
affection
might
render
him
unhappy
or
might
wound
his
raoul
did
not
reply
alas
continued
la

it
is
only
too
true
my
cause
is
a
bad
one
and
i
can
not
tell
in
what
way
to
begin
it
will
be
better
for
me
i
think
to
relate
to
you
very
simply
everything
that
has
befallen
me
as
i
shall
speak
but
the
pure
and
simple
truth
i
shall
always
find
my
path
clear
before
me
in
spite
of
the
obscurity
and
obstacles
i
have
to
brave
in
order
to
solace
my
heart
which
is
full
to
overflowing
and
wishes
to
pour
itself
out
at
your
raoul
continued
to
preserve
the
same
unbroken
silence
la
valliere
looked
at
him
with
an
air
that
seemed
to
say
encourage
me
for
pity
s
sake
but
a
single
word
but
raoul
did
not
open
his
lips
and
the
young
girl
was
obliged
to
continue
just
now
she
said
m
de
came
to
me
by
the
king
s
she
cast
down
her
eyes
as
she
said
this
while
raoul
on
his
side
turned
his
away
in
order
to
avoid
looking
at
her
m
de
came
to
me
from
the
king
she
repeated
and
told
me
that
you
knew
all
and
she
attempted
to
look
raoul
in
the
face
after
inflicting
this
further
wound
upon
him
in
addition
to
the
many
others
he
had
already
received
but
it
was
impossible
to
meet
raoul
s
eyes
he
told
me
you
were
incensed
with
me
and
justly
so
i
this
time
raoul
looked
at
the
young
girl
and
a
smile
full
of
disdain
passed
across
his
lips
oh
she
continued
i
entreat
you
do
not
say
that
you
have
had
any
other
feeling
against
me
than
that
of
anger
merely
raoul
wait
until
i
have
told
you
all
wait
until
i
have
said
to
you
all
that
i
had
to
say
all
that
i
came
to
raoul
by
the
strength
of
his
iron
will
forced
his
features
to
assume
a
calmer
expression
and
the
disdainful
smile
upon
his
lip
passed
away
in
the
first
place
said
la
valliere
in
the
first
place
with
my
hands
raised
in
entreaty
towards
you
with
my
forehead
bowed
to
the
ground
before
you
i
entreat
you
as
the
most
generous
as
the
noblest
of
men
to
pardon
to
forgive
me
if
i
have
left
you
in
ignorance
of
what
was
passing
in
my
own
bosom
never
at
least
would
i
have
consented
to
deceive
you
oh
i
entreat
you
raoul
i
implore
you
on
my
knees
answer
me
one
word
even
though
you
wrong
me
in
doing
so
better
far
better
an
injurious
word
from
your
lips
than
suspicion
resting
in
your
i
admire
your
subtlety
of
expression
mademoiselle
said
raoul
making
an
effort
to
remain
calm
to
leave
another
in
ignorance
that
you
are
deceiving
him
is
loyal
but
to
deceive
him
it
seems
that
would
be
very
wrong
and
that
you
would
not
do
monsieur
for
a
long
time
i
thought
that
i
loved
you
better
than
anything
else
and
so
long
as
i
believed
in
my
affection
for
you
i
told
you
that
loved
you
i
could
have
sworn
it
on
the
altar
but
a
day
came
when
i
was
well
on
that
day
mademoiselle
knowing
that
i
still
continued
to
love
you
true
loyalty
of
conduct
should
have
forced
you
to
inform
me
you
had
ceased
to
love
but
on
that
day
raoul
on
that
day
when
i
read
in
the
depths
of
my
own
heart
when
i
confessed
to
myself
that
you
no
longer
filled
my
mind
entirely
when
i
saw
another
future
before
me
than
that
of
being
your
friend
your
companion
your
wife
on
that
day
raoul
you
were
not
alas
any
more
beside
but
you
knew
where
i
was
mademoiselle
you
could
have
written
to
raoul
i
did
not
dare
to
do
so
raoul
i
have
been
weak
and
cowardly
i
knew
you
so
thoroughly
i
knew
how
devotedly
you
loved
me
that
i
trembled
at
the
bare
idea
of
the
grief
i
was
about
to
cause
you
and
that
is
so
true
raoul
that
this
very
moment
i
am
now
speaking
to
you
bending
thus
before
you
my
heart
crushed
in
my
bosom
my
voice
full
of
sighs
my
eyes
full
of
tears
it
is
so
perfectly
true
that
i
have
no
other
defense
than
my
frankness
i
have
no
other
sorrow
greater
than
that
which
i
read
in
your
raoul
attempted
to
smile
no
said
the
young
girl
with
a
profound
conviction
no
no
you
will
not
do
me
so
foul
a
wrong
as
to
disguise
your
feelings
before
me
now
you
loved
me
you
were
sure
of
your
affection
for
me
you
did
not
deceive
yourself
you
do
not
lie
to
your
own
heart
whilst
i
i
and
pale
as
death
her
arms
thrown
despairingly
above
her
head
she
fell
upon
her
knees
whilst
you
said
raoul
you
told
me
you
loved
me
and
yet
you
loved
alas
yes
cried
the
poor
girl
alas
yes
i
do
love
another
and
that
other
oh
for
heaven
s
sake
let
me
say
it
raoul
for
it
is
my
only
excuse
that
other
i
love
better
than
my
own
life
better
than
my
own
soul
even
forgive
my
fault
or
punish
my
treason
raoul
i
came
here
in
no
way
to
defend
myself
but
merely
to
say
to
you
you
know
what
it
is
to
love
in
such
a
case
am
i
i
love
to
that
degree
that
i
would
give
my
life
my
very
soul
to
the
man
i
love
if
he
should
ever
cease
to
love
me
i
shall
die
of
grief
and
despair
unless
heaven
come
to
my
assistance
unless
heaven
does
show
pity
upon
me
raoul
i
came
here
to
submit
myself
to
your
will
whatever
it
might
be
to
die
if
it
were
your
wish
i
should
die
kill
me
then
raoul
if
in
your
heart
you
believe
i
deserve
take
care
mademoiselle
said
raoul
the
woman
who
invites
death
is
one
who
has
nothing
but
her
heart
s
blood
to
offer
to
her
deceived
and
betrayed
you
are
right
she
said
raoul
uttered
a
deep
sigh
as
he
exclaimed
and
you
love
without
being
able
to
forget
i
love
without
a
wish
to
forget
without
a
wish
ever
to
love
any
one
else
replied
la
valliere
very
well
said
raoul
you
have
said
to
me
in
fact
all
you
had
to
say
all
i
could
possibly
wish
to
know
and
now
mademoiselle
it
is
i
who
ask
your
forgiveness
for
it
is
i
who
have
almost
been
an
obstacle
in
your
life
i
too
who
have
been
wrong
for
in
deceiving
myself
i
helped
to
deceive
oh
said
la
valliere
i
do
not
ask
you
so
much
as
that
i
only
am
to
blame
mademoiselle
continued
raoul
better
informed
than
yourself
of
the
difficulties
of
this
life
i
should
have
enlightened
you
i
ought
not
to
have
relied
upon
uncertainty
i
ought
to
have
extracted
an
answer
from
your
heart
whilst
i
hardly
even
sought
an
acknowledgement
from
your
lips
once
more
mademoiselle
it
is
i
who
ask
your
impossible
impossible
she
cried
you
are
mocking
how
impossible
yes
it
is
impossible
to
be
so
good
and
kind
ah
perfect
to
such
a
degree
as
take
care
said
raoul
with
a
bitter
smile
for
presently
you
may
say
perhaps
i
did
not
love
oh
you
love
me
like
an
affectionate
brother
let
me
hope
that
as
a
brother
undeceive
yourself
louise
i
love
you
as
a
lover
as
a
husband
with
the
deepest
the
truest
the
fondest
raoul
raoul
as
a
brother
oh
louise
i
love
you
so
deeply
that
i
would
have
shed
my
blood
for
you
drop
by
drop
i
would
oh
how
willingly
have
suffered
myself
to
be
torn
to
pieces
for
your
sake
have
sacrificed
my
very
future
for
you
i
love
you
so
deeply
louise
that
my
heart
feels
dead
and
crushed
within
me
my
faith
in
human
nature
all
is
gone
my
eyes
have
lost
their
light
i
loved
you
so
deeply
that
i
now
no
longer
see
think
of
care
for
anything
either
in
this
world
or
the
raoul
dear
raoul
spare
me
i
implore
you
cried
la
valliere
oh
if
i
had
but
known
it
is
too
late
louise
you
love
you
are
happy
in
your
affection
i
read
your
happiness
through
your
tears
behind
the
tears
which
the
loyalty
of
your
nature
makes
you
shed
i
feel
the
sighs
your
affection
breathes
forth
louise
louise
you
have
made
me
the
most
abjectly
wretched
man
living
leave
me
i
entreat
you
adieu
adieu
forgive
me
oh
forgive
me
raoul
for
what
i
have
have
i
not
done
much
much
more
i
not
told
you
that
i
love
you
still
she
buried
her
face
in
her
hands
and
to
tell
you
that
do
you
hear
me
louise
to
tell
you
that
at
such
a
moment
as
this
to
tell
you
that
as
i
have
told
you
is
to
pronounce
my
own
sentence
of
death
adieu
la
valliere
held
out
her
hands
to
him
in
vain
we
ought
not
to
see
each
other
again
in
this
world
he
said
and
as
she
was
on
the
point
of
crying
out
in
bitter
agony
at
this
remark
he
placed
his
hand
on
her
mouth
to
stifle
the
exclamation
she
pressed
her
lips
upon
it
and
fell
fainting
to
the
ground
olivain
said
raoul
take
this
young
lady
and
bear
her
to
the
carriage
which
is
waiting
for
her
at
the
as
olivain
lifted
her
up
raoul
made
a
movement
as
if
to
dart
towards
la
valliere
in
order
to
give
her
a
first
and
last
kiss
but
stopping
abruptly
he
said
no
she
is
not
mine
i
am
no
thief
as
is
the
king
of
and
he
returned
to
his
room
whilst
the
lackey
carried
la
valliere
still
fainting
to
the
carriage
chapter
lxii
what
raoul
had
guessed
as
soon
as
raoul
had
quitted
athos
and
d
artagnan
as
the
two
exclamations
that
had
followed
his
departure
escaped
their
lips
they
found
themselves
face
to
face
alone
athos
immediately
resumed
the
earnest
air
that
he
had
assumed
at
d
artagnan
s
arrival
well
he
said
what
have
you
come
to
announce
to
me
my
friend
i
inquired
d
artagnan
yes
i
do
not
see
you
in
this
way
without
some
reason
for
it
said
athos
smiling
the
deuce
said
d
artagnan
i
will
place
you
at
your
ease
the
king
is
furious
i
suppose
well
i
must
say
he
is
not
altogether
and
you
have
come
to
arrest
me
then
my
dear
friend
you
have
hit
the
very
oh
i
expected
it
i
am
quite
ready
to
go
with
deuce
take
it
said
d
artagnan
what
a
hurry
you
are
i
am
afraid
of
delaying
you
said
athos
smiling
i
have
plenty
of
time
are
you
not
curious
besides
to
know
how
things
went
on
between
the
king
and
me
if
you
will
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
i
will
listen
with
the
greatest
of
pleasure
said
athos
pointing
out
to
d
artagnan
a
large
chair
into
which
the
latter
threw
himself
assuming
the
easiest
possible
attitude
well
i
will
do
so
willingly
enough
continued
d
artagnan
for
the
conversation
is
rather
curious
i
must
say
in
the
first
place
the
king
sent
for
as
soon
as
i
had
left
you
were
just
going
down
the
last
steps
of
the
staircase
as
the
musketeers
told
me
i
arrived
my
dear
athos
he
was
not
red
in
the
face
merely
he
was
positively
purple
i
was
not
aware
of
course
of
what
had
passed
only
on
the
ground
lying
on
the
floor
i
saw
a
sword
broken
in
captain
d
artagnan
cried
the
king
as
soon
as
he
saw
me
sire
i
replied
m
de
la
fere
has
just
left
me
he
is
an
insolent
an
insolent
man
i
exclaimed
in
such
a
tone
that
the
king
stopped
suddenly
short
captain
d
artagnan
resumed
the
king
with
his
teeth
clenched
you
will
be
good
enough
to
listen
to
and
hear
that
is
my
duty
i
have
out
of
consideration
for
de
la
fere
wished
to
spare
him
he
is
a
man
of
whom
i
still
retain
some
kind
recollections
the
discredit
of
being
arrested
in
my
palace
you
will
therefore
take
a
at
this
i
made
a
slight
movement
if
you
object
to
arrest
him
yourself
continued
the
king
send
me
my
captain
of
the
sire
i
replied
there
is
no
necessity
for
the
captain
of
the
guards
since
i
am
on
i
should
not
like
to
annoy
you
said
the
king
kindly
for
you
have
always
served
me
well
monsieur
d
you
do
not
annoy
me
sire
i
replied
i
am
on
duty
that
is
but
said
the
king
in
astonishment
i
believe
the
comte
is
your
friend
if
he
were
my
father
sire
it
would
not
make
me
less
on
duty
than
i
the
king
looked
at
me
he
saw
how
unmoved
my
face
was
and
seemed
satisfied
you
will
arrest
le
comte
de
la
fere
then
he
inquired
most
certainly
sire
if
you
give
me
the
order
to
do
very
well
i
order
you
to
do
i
bowed
and
replied
where
is
the
comte
sire
you
will
look
for
and
am
i
to
arrest
him
wherever
he
may
be
yes
but
try
that
he
may
be
at
his
own
house
if
he
should
have
started
for
his
own
estate
leave
paris
at
once
and
arrest
him
on
his
way
i
bowed
but
as
i
did
not
move
he
said
well
what
are
you
waiting
for
for
the
order
to
arrest
the
comte
signed
by
the
king
seemed
annoyed
for
in
point
of
fact
it
was
the
exercise
of
a
fresh
act
of
authority
a
repetition
of
the
arbitrary
act
if
indeed
it
is
to
be
considered
as
such
he
took
hold
of
his
pen
slowly
and
evidently
in
no
very
good
temper
and
then
he
wrote
order
for
le
chevalier
d
artagnan
captain
of
my
musketeers
to
arrest
le
comte
de
la
fere
wherever
he
is
to
be
he
then
turned
towards
me
but
i
was
looking
on
without
moving
a
muscle
of
my
face
in
all
probability
he
thought
he
perceived
something
like
bravado
in
my
tranquil
manner
for
he
signed
hurriedly
and
then
handing
me
the
order
he
said
go
monsieur
i
obeyed
and
here
i
athos
pressed
his
friend
s
hand
well
let
us
set
off
he
said
oh
surely
said
d
artagnan
you
must
have
some
trifling
matters
to
arrange
before
you
leave
your
apartments
in
this
i
not
at
why
not
why
you
know
d
artagnan
that
i
have
always
been
a
very
simple
traveler
on
this
earth
ready
to
go
to
the
end
of
the
world
by
the
order
of
my
sovereign
ready
to
quit
it
at
the
summons
of
my
maker
what
does
a
man
who
is
thus
prepared
require
in
such
a
case
a
portmanteau
or
a
shroud
i
am
ready
at
this
moment
as
i
have
always
been
my
dear
friend
and
can
accompany
you
at
but
bragelonne
i
have
brought
him
up
in
the
same
principles
i
laid
down
for
my
own
guidance
and
you
observed
that
as
soon
as
he
perceived
you
he
guessed
that
very
moment
the
motive
of
your
visit
we
have
thrown
him
off
his
guard
for
a
moment
but
do
not
be
uneasy
he
is
sufficiently
prepared
for
my
disgrace
not
to
be
too
much
alarmed
at
it
so
let
us
very
well
let
us
go
said
d
artagnan
quietly
as
i
broke
my
sword
in
the
king
s
presence
and
threw
the
pieces
at
his
feet
i
presume
that
will
dispense
with
the
necessity
of
delivering
it
over
to
you
are
quite
right
and
besides
that
what
the
deuce
do
you
suppose
i
could
do
with
your
sword
am
i
to
walk
behind
or
before
you
inquired
athos
laughing
you
will
walk
arm
in
arm
with
me
replied
d
artagnan
as
he
took
the
comte
s
arm
to
descend
the
staircase
and
in
this
manner
they
arrived
at
the
landing
grimaud
whom
they
had
met
in
the
looked
at
them
as
they
went
out
together
in
this
manner
with
some
little
uneasiness
his
experience
of
affairs
was
quite
sufficient
to
give
him
good
reason
to
suspect
that
there
was
something
wrong
ah
is
that
you
grimaud
said
athos
kindly
we
are
going
to
take
a
turn
in
my
carriage
interrupted
d
artagnan
with
a
friendly
nod
of
the
head
grimaud
thanked
d
artagnan
by
a
grimace
which
was
evidently
intended
for
a
smile
and
accompanied
both
the
friends
to
the
door
athos
entered
first
into
the
carriage
d
artagnan
followed
him
without
saying
a
word
to
the
coachman
the
departure
had
taken
place
so
quietly
that
it
excited
no
disturbance
or
attention
even
in
the
neighborhood
when
the
carriage
had
reached
the
quays
you
are
taking
me
to
the
bastile
i
perceive
said
athos
i
said
d
artagnan
i
take
you
wherever
you
may
choose
to
go
nowhere
else
i
can
assure
what
do
you
mean
said
the
comte
surprised
why
surely
my
dear
friend
said
d
artagnan
you
quite
understand
that
i
undertook
the
mission
with
no
other
object
in
view
than
that
of
carrying
it
out
exactly
as
you
liked
you
surely
did
not
expect
that
i
was
going
to
get
you
thrown
into
prison
like
that
brutally
and
without
any
reflection
if
i
had
anticipated
that
i
should
have
let
the
captain
of
the
guards
undertake
and
so
said
athos
and
so
i
repeat
again
we
will
go
wherever
you
may
my
dear
friend
said
athos
embracing
d
artagnan
how
like
you
that
is
well
it
seems
simple
enough
to
me
the
coachman
will
take
you
to
the
barrier
of
the
you
will
find
a
horse
there
which
i
have
ordered
to
be
kept
ready
for
you
with
that
horse
you
will
be
able
to
do
three
posts
without
stopping
and
i
on
my
side
will
take
care
not
to
return
to
the
king
to
tell
him
that
you
have
gone
away
until
the
very
moment
it
will
be
impossible
to
overtake
you
in
the
meantime
you
will
have
reached
le
havre
and
from
le
havre
across
to
england
where
you
will
find
the
charming
residence
of
which
monk
made
me
a
present
without
speaking
of
the
hospitality
which
king
charles
will
not
fail
to
show
you
well
what
do
you
think
of
this
project
athos
shook
his
head
and
then
said
smiling
as
he
did
so
no
no
take
me
to
the
you
are
an
obstinate
fellow
my
dear
athos
returned
d
artagnan
reflect
for
a
few
on
what
subject
that
you
are
no
longer
twenty
years
of
age
believe
me
i
speak
according
to
my
own
knowledge
and
experience
a
prison
is
certain
death
for
men
who
are
at
our
time
of
life
no
no
i
will
never
allow
you
to
languish
in
prison
in
such
a
way
why
the
very
thought
of
it
makes
my
head
turn
dear
d
artagnan
athos
replied
heaven
most
fortunately
made
my
body
as
strong
powerful
and
enduring
as
my
mind
and
rely
upon
it
i
shall
retain
my
strength
up
to
the
very
last
but
this
is
not
strength
of
mind
or
character
it
is
sheer
no
d
artagnan
it
is
the
highest
order
of
reasoning
do
not
suppose
that
i
should
in
the
slightest
degree
in
the
world
discuss
the
question
with
you
whether
you
would
not
be
ruined
in
endeavoring
to
save
me
i
should
have
done
precisely
as
you
propose
if
flight
had
been
part
of
my
plan
of
action
i
should
therefore
have
accepted
from
you
what
without
any
doubt
you
would
have
accepted
from
me
no
i
know
you
too
well
even
to
breathe
a
word
upon
the
ah
if
you
would
only
let
me
do
it
said
d
artagnan
what
a
dance
we
would
give
his
most
gracious
majesty
still
he
is
the
king
do
not
forget
that
my
dear
oh
that
is
all
the
same
to
me
and
king
though
he
be
i
would
plainly
tell
him
sire
imprison
exile
kill
every
one
in
france
and
europe
order
me
to
arrest
and
poniard
even
whom
you
like
even
were
it
monsieur
your
own
brother
but
do
not
touch
one
of
the
four
musketeers
or
if
so
my
dear
friend
replied
athos
with
perfect
calmness
i
should
like
to
persuade
you
of
one
thing
namely
that
i
wish
to
be
arrested
that
i
desire
above
all
things
that
my
arrest
should
take
d
artagnan
made
a
slight
movement
of
his
shoulders
nay
i
wish
it
i
repeat
more
than
anything
if
you
were
to
let
me
escape
it
would
be
only
to
return
of
my
own
accord
and
constitute
myself
a
prisoner
i
wish
to
prove
to
this
young
man
who
is
dazzled
by
the
power
and
splendor
of
his
crown
that
he
can
be
regarded
as
the
first
and
chiefest
among
men
only
on
the
one
condition
of
his
proving
himself
to
be
the
most
generous
and
the
wisest
he
may
punish
me
imprison
torture
me
it
matters
not
he
abuses
his
opportunities
and
i
wish
him
to
learn
the
bitterness
of
remorse
while
heaven
teaches
him
what
chastisement
well
well
replied
d
artagnan
i
know
only
too
well
that
when
you
have
once
said
no
you
mean
i
do
not
insist
any
longer
you
wish
to
go
to
the
bastile
i
do
wish
to
go
let
us
go
then
to
the
bastile
cried
d
artagnan
to
the
coachman
and
throwing
himself
back
in
the
carriage
he
gnawed
the
ends
of
his
mustache
with
a
fury
which
for
athos
who
knew
him
well
signified
a
resolution
either
already
taken
or
in
course
of
formation
a
profound
silence
ensued
in
the
carriage
which
continued
to
roll
on
but
neither
faster
nor
slower
than
before
athos
took
the
musketeer
by
the
hand
you
are
not
angry
with
me
d
artagnan
he
said
i
oh
no
certainly
not
of
course
not
what
you
do
for
heroism
i
should
have
done
from
but
you
are
quite
of
opinion
are
you
not
that
heaven
will
avenge
me
d
artagnan
and
i
know
one
or
two
on
earth
who
will
not
fail
to
lend
a
helping
hand
said
the
captain
chapter
lxiii
three
guests
astonished
to
find
themselves
at
supper
together
the
carriage
arrived
at
the
outside
of
the
gate
of
the
bastile
a
soldier
on
guard
stopped
it
but
d
artagnan
had
only
to
utter
a
single
word
to
procure
admittance
and
the
carriage
passed
on
without
further
difficulty
whilst
they
were
proceeding
along
the
covered
way
which
led
to
the
courtyard
of
the
governor
s
residence
d
artagnan
whose
lynx
eyes
saw
everything
even
through
the
walls
suddenly
cried
out
what
is
that
out
yonder
well
said
athos
quietly
what
is
it
look
yonder
in
the
courtyard
yes
yes
make
haste
well
a
carriage
very
likely
conveying
a
prisoner
like
that
would
be
too
i
do
not
understand
make
haste
and
look
again
and
look
at
the
man
who
is
just
getting
out
of
that
at
that
very
moment
a
second
sentinel
stopped
d
artagnan
and
while
the
formalities
were
being
gone
through
athos
could
see
at
a
hundred
paces
from
him
the
man
whom
his
friend
had
pointed
out
to
him
he
was
in
fact
getting
out
of
the
carriage
at
the
door
of
the
governor
s
house
well
inquired
d
artagnan
do
you
see
him
yes
he
is
a
man
in
a
gray
what
do
you
say
of
him
i
can
not
very
well
tell
he
is
as
i
have
just
now
told
you
a
man
in
a
gray
suit
who
is
getting
out
of
a
carriage
that
is
athos
i
will
wager
anything
that
it
is
he
who
aramis
arrested
impossible
i
do
not
say
he
is
arrested
since
we
see
him
alone
in
his
well
then
what
is
he
doing
here
oh
he
knows
baisemeaux
the
governor
replied
the
musketeer
slyly
so
we
have
arrived
just
in
what
for
in
order
to
see
what
we
can
i
regret
this
meeting
exceedingly
when
aramis
sees
me
he
will
be
very
much
annoyed
in
the
first
place
at
seeing
me
and
in
the
next
at
being
very
well
unfortunately
there
is
no
remedy
for
it
whenever
any
one
meets
another
in
the
bastile
even
if
he
wished
to
draw
back
to
avoid
him
it
would
be
athos
i
have
an
idea
the
question
is
to
spare
aramis
the
annoyance
you
were
speaking
of
is
it
not
what
is
to
be
done
i
will
tell
you
or
in
order
to
explain
myself
in
the
best
possible
way
let
me
relate
the
affair
in
my
own
manner
i
will
not
recommend
you
to
tell
a
falsehood
for
that
would
be
impossible
for
you
to
do
but
i
will
tell
falsehoods
enough
for
both
it
is
easy
to
do
that
when
one
is
born
to
the
nature
and
habits
of
a
athos
smiled
the
carriage
stopped
where
the
one
we
have
just
now
pointed
out
had
stopped
namely
at
the
door
of
the
governor
s
house
it
is
understood
then
said
d
artagnan
in
a
low
voice
to
his
friend
athos
consented
by
a
gesture
they
ascended
the
staircase
there
will
be
no
occasion
for
surprise
at
the
facility
with
which
they
had
entered
into
the
bastile
if
it
be
remembered
that
before
passing
the
first
gate
in
fact
the
most
difficult
of
all
d
artagnan
had
announced
that
he
had
brought
a
prisoner
of
state
at
the
third
gate
on
the
contrary
that
is
to
say
when
he
had
once
fairly
entered
the
prison
he
merely
said
to
the
sentinel
to
baisemeaux
and
they
both
passed
on
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
in
the
governor
s
and
the
first
face
which
attracted
d
artagnan
s
observation
was
that
of
aramis
who
was
seated
side
by
side
with
baisemeaux
awaiting
the
announcement
of
a
meal
whose
odor
impregnated
the
whole
apartment
if
d
artagnan
pretended
surprise
aramis
did
not
pretend
at
all
he
started
when
he
saw
his
two
friends
and
his
emotion
was
very
apparent
athos
and
d
artagnan
however
complimented
him
as
usual
and
baisemeaux
amazed
completely
stupefied
by
the
presence
of
his
three
guests
began
to
perform
a
few
evolutions
around
them
by
what
lucky
accident
we
were
just
going
to
ask
you
retorted
d
artagnan
are
we
going
to
give
ourselves
up
as
prisoners
cried
aramis
with
an
affection
of
hilarity
ah
ah
said
d
artagnan
it
is
true
the
walls
smell
deucedly
like
a
prison
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
you
know
you
invited
me
to
sup
with
you
the
other
i
cried
baisemeaux
yes
of
course
you
did
although
you
now
seem
so
struck
with
amazement
don
t
you
remember
it
baisemeaux
turned
pale
and
then
red
looked
at
aramis
who
looked
at
him
and
finished
by
stammering
out
certainly
i
am
delighted
but
upon
my
honor
i
have
not
the
slightest
ah
i
have
such
a
wretched
well
i
am
wrong
i
see
said
d
artagnan
as
if
he
were
offended
wrong
what
for
wrong
to
remember
anything
about
it
it
baisemeaux
hurried
towards
him
do
not
stand
on
ceremony
my
dear
captain
he
said
i
have
the
worst
memory
in
the
world
i
no
sooner
leave
off
thinking
of
my
pigeons
and
their
than
i
am
no
better
than
the
rawest
at
all
events
you
remember
it
now
said
d
artagnan
boldly
yes
yes
replied
the
governor
hesitating
i
think
i
do
it
was
when
you
came
to
the
palace
to
see
me
you
told
me
some
story
or
other
about
your
accounts
with
de
louviere
and
de
oh
yes
and
about
d
herblay
s
kindness
towards
ah
exclaimed
aramis
looking
at
the
unhappy
governor
full
in
the
face
and
yet
you
just
now
said
you
had
no
memory
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
interrupted
the
musketeer
in
the
middle
of
his
revelations
yes
yes
you
re
quite
right
how
could
i
have
forgotten
i
remember
it
now
as
well
as
possible
i
beg
you
a
thousand
pardons
but
now
once
for
all
my
dear
d
artagnan
be
sure
that
at
this
present
time
as
at
any
other
whether
invited
or
not
you
are
perfectly
at
home
here
you
and
d
herblay
your
friend
he
said
turning
towards
aramis
and
this
gentleman
too
he
added
bowing
to
athos
well
i
thought
it
would
be
sure
to
turn
out
so
replied
d
artagnan
and
that
is
the
reason
i
came
having
nothing
to
do
this
evening
at
the
palais
royal
i
wished
to
judge
for
myself
what
your
ordinary
style
of
living
was
like
and
as
i
was
coming
along
i
met
the
comte
de
la
athos
bowed
the
comte
who
had
just
left
his
majesty
handed
me
an
order
which
required
immediate
attention
we
were
close
by
here
i
wished
to
call
in
even
if
it
were
for
no
other
object
than
that
of
shaking
hands
with
you
and
of
presenting
the
comte
to
you
of
whom
you
spoke
so
highly
that
evening
at
the
palace
when
certainly
certainly
le
comte
de
la
fere
the
comte
is
welcome
i
am
and
he
will
sup
with
you
two
i
suppose
whilst
i
unfortunate
dog
that
i
am
must
run
off
on
a
matter
of
duty
oh
what
happy
beings
you
are
compared
to
myself
he
added
sighing
as
loud
as
porthos
might
have
done
and
so
you
are
going
away
then
said
aramis
and
baisemeaux
together
with
the
same
expression
of
delighted
surprise
the
tone
of
which
was
immediately
noticed
by
d
artagnan
i
leave
you
in
my
place
he
said
a
noble
and
excellent
and
he
touched
athos
gently
on
the
shoulder
who
astonished
also
could
not
help
exhibiting
his
surprise
a
little
which
was
noticed
by
aramis
only
for
de
baisemeaux
was
not
quite
equal
to
the
three
friends
in
point
of
intelligence
what
are
you
going
to
leave
us
resumed
the
governor
i
shall
only
be
about
an
hour
or
an
hour
and
a
half
i
will
return
in
time
for
oh
we
will
wait
for
you
said
baisemeaux
no
no
that
would
be
really
disobliging
you
will
be
sure
to
return
though
said
athos
with
an
expression
of
doubt
most
certainly
he
said
pressing
his
friend
s
hand
confidently
and
he
added
in
a
low
voice
wait
for
me
athos
be
cheerful
and
lively
as
possible
and
above
all
don
t
allude
even
to
business
affairs
for
heaven
s
and
with
a
renewed
pressure
of
the
hand
he
seemed
to
warn
the
comte
of
the
necessity
of
keeping
perfectly
discreet
and
impenetrable
baisemeaux
led
d
artagnan
to
the
gate
aramis
with
many
friendly
protestations
of
delight
sat
down
by
athos
determined
to
make
him
speak
but
athos
possessed
every
virtue
and
quality
to
the
very
highest
degree
if
necessity
had
required
it
he
would
have
been
the
finest
orator
in
the
world
but
on
other
occasions
he
would
rather
have
died
than
have
opened
his
lips
ten
minutes
after
d
artagnan
s
departure
the
three
gentlemen
sat
down
to
table
which
was
covered
with
the
most
substantial
display
of
gastronomic
luxury
large
joints
exquisite
dishes
preserves
the
greatest
variety
of
wines
appeared
successively
upon
the
table
which
was
served
at
the
king
s
expense
and
of
which
expense
colbert
would
have
found
no
difficulty
in
saving
two
thirds
without
any
one
in
the
bastile
being
the
worse
for
it
baisemeaux
was
the
only
one
who
ate
and
drank
with
gastronomic
resolution
aramis
allowed
nothing
to
pass
by
him
but
merely
touched
everything
he
took
athos
after
the
soup
and
three
d
ate
nothing
more
the
style
of
conversation
was
such
as
might
have
been
anticipated
between
three
men
so
opposite
in
temper
and
ideas
aramis
was
incessantly
asking
himself
by
what
extraordinary
chance
athos
was
there
at
baisemeaux
s
when
d
artagnan
was
no
longer
there
and
why
d
artagnan
did
not
remain
when
athos
was
there
athos
sounded
all
the
depths
of
the
mind
of
aramis
who
lived
in
the
midst
of
subterfuge
evasion
and
intrigue
he
studied
his
man
well
and
thoroughly
and
felt
convinced
that
he
was
engaged
upon
some
important
project
and
then
he
too
began
to
think
of
his
own
personal
affair
and
to
lose
himself
in
conjectures
as
to
d
artagnan
s
reason
for
having
left
the
bastile
so
abruptly
and
for
leaving
behind
him
a
prisoner
so
badly
introduced
and
so
badly
looked
after
by
the
prison
authorities
but
we
shall
not
pause
to
examine
into
the
thoughts
and
feelings
of
these
personages
but
will
leave
them
to
themselves
surrounded
by
the
remains
of
poultry
game
and
fish
which
baisemeaux
s
generous
knife
and
fork
had
so
mutilated
we
are
going
to
follow
d
artagnan
instead
who
getting
into
the
carriage
which
had
brought
him
said
to
the
coachman
return
to
the
palace
as
fast
as
the
horses
can
chapter
lxiv
what
took
place
at
the
louvre
during
the
supper
at
the
bastile
de
had
executed
the
commission
with
which
the
king
had
intrusted
him
for
la
valliere
as
we
have
already
seen
in
one
of
the
preceding
chapters
but
whatever
his
eloquence
he
did
not
succeed
in
persuading
the
young
girl
that
she
had
in
the
king
a
protector
powerful
enough
for
her
under
any
combination
of
circumstances
and
that
she
had
no
need
of
any
one
else
in
the
world
when
the
king
was
on
her
side
in
point
of
fact
at
the
very
first
word
which
the
favorite
mentioned
of
the
discovery
of
the
famous
secret
louise
in
a
passion
of
tears
abandoned
herself
in
utter
despair
to
a
sorrow
which
would
have
been
far
from
flattering
for
the
king
if
he
had
been
a
witness
of
it
from
one
of
the
corners
of
the
room
in
his
character
of
ambassador
felt
almost
as
greatly
offended
at
it
as
his
master
himself
would
have
been
and
returned
to
inform
the
king
what
he
had
seen
and
heard
and
it
is
thus
we
find
him
in
a
state
of
great
agitation
in
the
presence
of
the
king
who
was
if
possible
in
a
state
of
even
greater
flurry
than
himself
but
said
the
king
to
the
courtier
when
the
latter
had
finished
his
report
what
did
she
decide
to
do
shall
i
at
least
see
her
presently
before
supper
will
she
come
to
me
or
shall
i
be
obliged
to
go
to
her
room
i
believe
sire
that
if
your
majesty
wishes
to
see
her
you
will
not
only
have
to
take
the
first
step
in
advance
but
will
have
to
go
the
whole
that
i
do
not
mind
do
you
think
she
has
yet
a
secret
fancy
for
young
bragelonne
muttered
the
king
between
his
teeth
oh
sire
that
is
not
possible
for
it
is
you
alone
i
am
convinced
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
loves
and
that
too
with
all
her
heart
but
you
know
that
de
bragelonne
belongs
to
that
proud
race
who
play
the
part
of
roman
the
king
smiled
feebly
he
knew
how
true
the
illustration
was
for
athos
had
just
left
him
as
for
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
continued
she
was
brought
up
under
the
care
of
the
dowager
madame
that
is
to
say
in
the
greatest
austerity
and
formality
this
young
engaged
couple
coldly
exchanged
their
little
vows
in
the
prim
presence
of
the
moon
and
stars
and
now
when
they
find
they
have
to
break
those
vows
asunder
it
plays
the
very
deuce
with
thought
to
have
made
the
king
laugh
but
on
the
contrary
from
a
mere
smile
louis
passed
to
the
greatest
seriousness
of
manner
he
already
began
to
experience
that
remorse
which
the
comte
had
promised
d
artagnan
he
would
inflict
upon
him
he
reflected
that
in
fact
these
young
persons
had
loved
and
sworn
fidelity
to
each
other
that
one
of
the
two
had
kept
his
word
and
that
the
other
was
too
conscientious
not
to
feel
her
perjury
most
bitterly
and
his
remorse
was
not
unaccompanied
for
bitter
pangs
of
jealousy
began
to
beset
the
king
s
heart
he
did
not
say
another
word
and
instead
of
going
to
pay
a
visit
to
his
mother
or
the
queen
or
madame
in
order
to
amuse
himself
a
little
and
make
the
ladies
laugh
as
he
himself
used
to
say
he
threw
himself
into
the
huge
armchair
in
which
his
august
father
louis
xiii
had
passed
so
many
weary
days
and
years
in
company
with
barradat
and
perceived
the
king
was
not
to
be
amused
at
that
moment
he
tried
a
last
resource
and
pronounced
louise
s
name
which
made
the
king
look
up
immediately
what
does
your
majesty
intend
to
do
this
evening
shall
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
be
informed
of
your
intention
to
see
her
it
seems
she
is
already
aware
of
that
replied
the
king
no
no
he
continued
after
a
moment
s
pause
we
will
both
of
us
pass
our
time
in
thinking
and
musing
and
dreaming
when
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
shall
have
sufficiently
regretted
what
she
now
regrets
she
will
deign
perhaps
to
give
us
some
news
of
ah
sire
is
it
possible
you
can
so
misunderstand
her
heart
which
is
so
full
of
devotion
the
king
rose
flushed
from
vexation
and
annoyance
he
was
a
prey
to
jealousy
as
well
as
to
remorse
was
just
beginning
to
feel
that
his
position
was
becoming
awkward
when
the
curtain
before
the
door
was
raised
the
king
turned
hastily
round
his
first
idea
was
that
a
letter
from
louise
had
arrived
but
instead
of
a
letter
of
love
he
only
saw
his
captain
of
musketeers
standing
upright
and
perfectly
silent
in
the
doorway
m
d
artagnan
he
said
ah
well
monsieur
d
artagnan
looked
at
the
king
s
eyes
took
the
same
direction
as
those
of
his
captain
these
looks
would
have
been
clear
to
any
one
and
for
a
still
greater
reason
they
were
so
for
the
courtier
bowed
and
quitted
the
room
leaving
the
king
and
d
artagnan
alone
is
it
done
inquired
the
king
yes
sire
replied
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
in
a
grave
voice
it
is
the
king
was
unable
to
say
another
word
pride
however
obliged
him
not
to
pause
at
what
he
had
done
whenever
a
sovereign
has
adopted
a
decisive
course
even
though
it
be
unjust
he
is
compelled
to
prove
to
all
witnesses
and
particularly
to
prove
it
to
himself
that
he
was
quite
right
all
through
a
good
means
for
effecting
that
an
almost
infallible
means
indeed
is
to
try
and
prove
his
victim
to
be
in
the
wrong
louis
brought
up
by
mazarin
and
anne
of
austria
knew
better
than
any
one
else
his
vocation
as
a
monarch
he
therefore
endeavored
to
prove
it
on
the
present
occasion
after
a
few
moment
s
pause
which
he
had
employed
in
making
silently
to
himself
the
same
reflections
which
we
have
just
expressed
aloud
he
said
in
an
indifferent
tone
what
did
the
comte
say
nothing
at
all
surely
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
be
arrested
without
saying
something
he
said
he
expected
to
be
arrested
the
king
raised
his
head
haughtily
i
presume
he
said
that
le
comte
de
la
fere
has
not
continued
to
play
his
obstinate
and
rebellious
in
the
first
place
sire
what
do
you
wish
to
signify
by
quietly
asked
the
musketeer
a
rebel
in
the
eyes
of
the
king
is
a
man
who
not
only
allows
himself
to
be
shut
up
in
the
bastile
but
still
more
who
opposes
those
who
do
not
wish
to
take
him
who
do
not
wish
to
take
him
there
exclaimed
the
king
what
do
you
say
captain
are
you
mad
i
believe
not
you
speak
of
persons
who
did
not
wish
to
arrest
de
la
fere
who
are
those
persons
may
i
ask
i
should
say
those
whom
your
majesty
intrusted
with
that
but
it
was
you
whom
i
intrusted
with
it
exclaimed
the
king
yes
sire
it
was
and
yet
you
say
that
despite
my
orders
you
had
the
intention
of
not
arresting
the
man
who
had
insulted
me
yes
sire
that
was
really
my
intention
i
even
proposed
to
the
comte
to
mount
a
horse
that
i
had
prepared
for
him
at
the
barriere
de
la
and
what
was
your
object
in
getting
this
horse
ready
why
sire
in
order
that
le
comte
de
la
fere
might
be
able
to
reach
le
havre
and
from
that
place
make
his
escape
to
you
betrayed
me
then
monsieur
cried
the
king
kindling
with
a
wild
pride
exactly
there
was
nothing
to
say
in
answer
to
statements
made
in
such
a
tone
the
king
was
astounded
at
such
an
obstinate
and
open
resistance
on
the
part
of
d
artagnan
at
least
you
had
a
reason
monsieur
d
artagnan
for
acting
as
you
did
said
the
king
proudly
i
have
always
a
reason
for
everything
your
reason
can
not
be
your
friendship
for
the
comte
at
all
events
the
only
one
that
can
be
of
any
avail
the
only
one
that
could
possibly
excuse
you
for
i
placed
you
perfectly
at
your
ease
in
that
me
sire
did
i
not
give
you
the
choice
to
arrest
or
not
to
arrest
le
comte
de
la
fere
yes
sire
but
but
what
exclaimed
the
king
impatiently
but
you
warned
me
sire
that
if
i
did
not
arrest
him
your
captain
of
the
guard
should
do
was
i
not
considerate
enough
towards
you
from
the
very
moment
i
did
not
compel
you
to
obey
me
to
me
sire
you
were
but
not
to
my
friend
for
my
friend
would
be
arrested
all
the
same
whether
by
myself
or
by
the
captain
of
the
and
this
is
your
devotion
monsieur
a
devotion
which
argues
and
reasons
you
are
no
soldier
monsieur
i
wait
for
your
majesty
to
tell
me
what
i
well
then
you
are
a
and
since
there
is
no
longer
any
fronde
sire
in
that
case
but
if
what
you
say
is
true
what
i
say
is
always
true
what
have
you
come
to
say
to
me
monsieur
i
have
come
to
say
to
your
majesty
sire
de
la
fere
is
in
the
that
is
not
your
fault
it
would
that
is
true
sire
but
at
all
events
he
is
there
and
since
he
is
there
it
is
important
that
your
majesty
should
know
ah
monsieur
d
artagnan
so
you
set
your
king
at
sire
monsieur
d
artagnan
i
warn
you
that
you
are
abusing
my
on
the
contrary
what
do
you
mean
by
on
the
contrary
i
have
come
to
get
myself
arrested
to
get
yourself
arrested
you
of
course
my
friend
will
get
wearied
to
death
in
the
bastile
by
himself
and
i
have
come
to
propose
to
your
majesty
to
permit
me
to
bear
him
company
if
your
majesty
will
but
give
me
the
word
i
will
arrest
myself
i
shall
not
need
the
captain
of
the
guards
for
that
i
assure
the
king
darted
towards
the
table
and
seized
hold
of
a
pen
to
write
the
order
for
d
artagnan
s
imprisonment
pay
attention
monsieur
that
this
is
forever
cried
the
king
in
tones
of
sternest
menace
i
can
quite
believe
that
returned
the
musketeer
for
when
you
have
once
done
such
an
act
as
that
you
will
never
be
able
to
look
me
in
the
face
the
king
dashed
down
his
pen
violently
leave
the
room
monsieur
he
said
not
so
if
it
please
your
what
is
that
you
say
sire
i
came
to
speak
gently
and
temperately
to
your
majesty
your
majesty
got
into
a
passion
with
me
that
is
a
misfortune
but
i
shall
not
the
less
on
that
account
say
what
i
had
to
say
to
your
resignation
monsieur
your
resignation
cried
the
king
sire
you
know
whether
i
care
about
my
resignation
or
not
since
at
blois
on
the
very
day
when
you
refused
king
charles
the
million
which
my
friend
the
comte
de
la
fere
gave
him
i
then
tendered
my
resignation
to
your
very
well
monsieur
do
it
at
once
no
sire
for
there
is
no
question
of
my
resignation
at
the
present
moment
your
majesty
took
up
your
pen
just
now
to
send
me
to
the
bastile
why
should
you
change
your
intention
d
artagnan
gascon
that
you
are
who
is
king
allow
me
to
ask
you
or
myself
you
sire
what
do
you
mean
by
unfortunately
yes
sire
for
if
it
were
i
if
it
were
you
you
would
approve
of
d
artagnan
s
rebellious
conduct
i
suppose
really
said
the
king
shrugging
his
shoulders
and
i
should
tell
my
captain
of
the
musketeers
continued
d
artagnan
i
should
tell
him
looking
at
him
all
the
while
with
human
eyes
and
not
with
eyes
like
coals
of
fire
m
d
artagnan
i
had
forgotten
that
i
was
the
king
for
i
descended
from
my
throne
in
order
to
insult
a
monsieur
said
the
king
do
you
think
you
can
excuse
your
friend
by
exceeding
him
in
insolence
oh
sire
i
should
go
much
further
than
he
did
said
d
artagnan
and
it
would
be
your
own
fault
i
should
tell
you
what
he
a
man
full
of
the
finest
sense
of
delicacy
did
not
tell
you
i
should
say
sire
you
have
sacrificed
his
son
and
he
defended
his
son
you
sacrificed
himself
he
addressed
you
in
the
name
of
honor
of
religion
of
virtue
you
repulsed
drove
him
away
imprisoned
i
should
be
harder
than
he
was
for
i
should
say
to
you
sire
it
is
for
you
to
choose
do
you
wish
to
have
friends
or
lackeys
soldiers
or
slaves
great
men
or
mere
puppets
do
you
wish
men
to
serve
you
or
to
bend
and
crouch
before
you
do
you
wish
men
to
love
you
or
to
be
afraid
of
you
if
you
prefer
baseness
intrigue
cowardice
say
so
at
once
sire
and
we
will
leave
you
we
who
are
the
only
individuals
who
are
left
nay
i
will
say
more
the
only
models
of
the
valor
of
former
times
we
who
have
done
our
duty
and
have
exceeded
perhaps
in
courage
and
in
merit
the
men
already
great
for
posterity
choose
sire
and
that
too
without
delay
whatever
relics
remain
to
you
of
the
great
nobility
guard
them
with
a
jealous
eye
you
will
never
be
deficient
in
courtiers
delay
not
and
send
me
to
the
bastile
with
my
friend
for
if
you
did
not
know
how
to
listen
to
the
comte
de
la
fere
whose
voice
is
the
sweetest
and
noblest
in
all
the
world
when
honor
is
the
theme
if
you
do
not
know
how
to
listen
to
d
artagnan
the
frankest
and
honestest
voice
of
sincerity
you
are
a
bad
king
and
will
be
a
poor
king
and
learn
from
me
sire
that
bad
kings
are
hated
by
their
people
and
poor
kings
are
driven
ignominiously
that
is
what
i
had
to
say
to
you
sire
you
were
wrong
to
drive
me
to
say
the
king
threw
himself
back
in
his
chair
cold
as
death
and
as
livid
as
a
corpse
had
a
thunderbolt
fallen
at
his
feet
he
could
not
have
been
more
astonished
he
seemed
as
if
his
respiration
had
utterly
ceased
and
that
he
was
at
the
point
of
death
the
honest
voice
of
sincerity
as
d
artagnan
had
called
it
had
pierced
through
his
heart
like
a
d
artagnan
had
said
all
he
had
to
say
comprehending
the
king
s
anger
he
drew
his
sword
and
approaching
louis
xiv
respectfully
he
placed
it
on
the
table
but
the
king
with
a
furious
gesture
thrust
aside
the
sword
which
fell
on
the
ground
and
rolled
to
d
artagnan
s
feet
notwithstanding
the
perfect
mastery
which
d
artagnan
exercised
over
himself
he
too
in
his
turn
became
pale
and
trembling
with
indignation
said
a
king
may
disgrace
a
soldier
he
may
exile
him
and
may
even
condemn
him
to
death
but
were
he
a
hundred
times
a
king
he
has
no
right
to
insult
him
by
casting
a
dishonor
upon
his
sword
sire
a
king
of
france
has
never
repulsed
with
contempt
the
sword
of
a
man
such
as
i
am
stained
with
disgrace
as
this
sword
now
is
it
has
henceforth
no
other
sheath
than
either
your
heart
or
my
own
i
choose
my
own
sire
and
you
have
to
thank
heaven
and
my
own
patience
that
i
do
then
snatching
up
his
sword
he
cried
my
blood
be
upon
your
head
and
with
a
rapid
gesture
he
placed
the
hilt
upon
the
floor
and
directed
the
point
of
the
blade
towards
his
breast
the
king
however
with
a
movement
far
more
rapid
than
that
of
d
artagnan
threw
his
right
arm
around
the
musketeer
s
neck
and
with
his
left
hand
seized
hold
of
the
blade
by
the
middle
and
returned
it
silently
to
the
scabbard
d
artagnan
upright
pale
and
still
trembling
let
the
king
do
all
to
the
very
end
louis
overcome
and
softened
by
gentler
feelings
returned
to
the
table
took
a
pen
in
his
hand
wrote
a
few
lines
signed
them
and
then
held
it
out
to
d
artagnan
what
is
this
paper
sire
inquired
the
captain
an
order
for
d
artagnan
to
set
the
comte
de
la
fere
at
liberty
d
artagnan
seized
the
king
s
hand
and
imprinted
a
kiss
upon
it
he
then
folded
the
order
placed
it
in
his
belt
and
quitted
the
room
neither
the
king
nor
the
captain
had
uttered
a
syllable
oh
human
heart
thou
guide
and
director
of
kings
murmured
louis
when
alone
when
shall
i
learn
to
read
in
your
inmost
recesses
as
in
the
leaves
of
a
book
oh
i
am
not

to
return
in

and
he
kept
his
word

had
just
reached
the
finer
and
more
delicate
class
of

and
liqueurs
with
which
the
governor

cellar
had
the
reputation
of
being
most
admirably
stocked
when
the
silver
spurs
of

resounded
in

corridor
and
he
himself
appeared
at
the
threshold
athos
and

had
played
a
close
game
neither
of
the
two
had
been
able
to
gain
the
slightest
advantage
over

they
had
supped

had
in

alluded

very
midst
of

conversation

pale
and
much
disturbed
by
his
interview
with
the

hastened
to
give
him
a

athos
and
aramis
both
remarked
his
emotion
as
for
baisemeaux
he
saw
nothing
more
than
the
captain
of
the
king
s
musketeers
to
whom
he
endeavored
to
show
every
possible
attention
but
although
aramis
had
remarked
his
emotion
he
had
not
been
able
to
guess
the
cause
of
it
athos
alone
believed
he
had
detected
it
for
him
d
artagnan
s
return
and
particularly
the
manner
in
which
he
usually
so
impassible
seemed
overcome
signified
i
have
just
asked
the
king
something
which
the
king
has
refused
thoroughly
convinced
that
his
conjecture
was
correct
athos
smiled
rose
from
the
table
and
made
a
sign
to
d
artagnan
as
if
to
remind
him
that
they
had
something
else
to
do
than
to
sup
together
d
artagnan
immediately
understood
him
and
replied
by
another
sign
aramis
and
baisemeaux
watched
this
silent
dialogue
and
looked
inquiringly
at
each
other
athos
felt
that
he
was
called
upon
to
give
an
explanation
of
what
was
passing
the
truth
is
my
friend
said
the
comte
de
la
fere
with
a
smile
that
you
aramis
have
been
supping
with
a
state
criminal
and
you
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
with
your
baisemeaux
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
and
almost
of
delight
for
he
was
exceedingly
proud
and
vain
of
his
fortress
and
for
his
own
individual
profit
the
more
prisoners
he
had
the
happier
he
was
and
the
higher
in
rank
the
prisoners
happened
to
be
the
prouder
he
felt
aramis
assumed
the
expression
of
countenance
he
thought
the
position
justified
and
said
well
dear
athos
forgive
me
but
i
almost
suspected
what
has
happened
some
prank
of
raoul
and
la
valliere
i
suppose
alas
said
baisemeaux
and
continued
aramis
you
a
high
and
powerful
nobleman
as
you
are
forgetful
that
courtiers
now
exist
you
have
been
to
the
king
i
suppose
and
told
him
what
you
thought
of
his
conduct
yes
you
have
guessed
so
that
said
baisemeaux
trembling
at
having
supped
so
familiarly
with
a
man
who
had
fallen
into
disgrace
with
the
king
so
that
monsieur
le
comte
so
that
my
dear
governor
said
athos
my
friend
d
artagnan
will
communicate
to
you
the
contents
of
the
paper
which
i
perceived
just
peeping
out
of
his
belt
and
which
assuredly
can
be
nothing
else
than
the
order
for
my
baisemeaux
held
out
his
hand
with
his
accustomed
eagerness
d
artagnan
drew
two
papers
from
his
belt
and
presented
one
of
them
to
the
governor
who
unfolded
it
and
then
read
in
a
low
tone
of
voice
looking
at
athos
over
the
paper
as
he
did
so
and
pausing
from
time
to
time
order
to
detain
in
my
chateau
of
the
bastile
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
oh
monsieur
this
is
indeed
a
very
melancholy
day
for
you
will
have
a
patient
prisoner
monsieur
said
athos
in
his
calm
soft
voice
a
prisoner
too
who
will
not
remain
a
month
with
you
my
dear
governor
said
aramis
while
baisemeaux
still
holding
the
order
in
his
hand
transcribed
it
upon
the
prison
registry
not
a
day
or
rather
not
even
a
night
said
d
artagnan
displaying
the
second
order
of
the
king
for
now
dear
de
baisemeaux
you
will
have
the
goodness
to
transcribe
also
this
order
for
setting
the
comte
immediately
at
ah
said
aramis
it
is
a
labor
that
you
have
deprived
me
of
d
artagnan
and
he
pressed
the
musketeer
s
hand
in
a
significant
manner
at
the
same
moment
as
that
of
athos
what
said
the
latter
in
astonishment
the
king
sets
me
at
liberty
read
my
dear
friend
returned
d
artagnan
athos
took
the
order
and
read
it
it
is
quite
true
he
said
are
you
sorry
for
it
asked
d
artagnan
oh
no
on
the
contrary
i
wish
the
king
no
harm
and
the
greatest
evil
or
misfortune
that
any
one
can
wish
kings
is
that
they
should
commit
an
act
of
injustice
but
you
have
had
a
difficult
and
painful
task
i
know
tell
me
have
you
not
d
artagnan
i
not
at
all
said
the
musketeer
laughing
the
king
does
everything
i
wish
him
to
aramis
looked
fixedly
at
d
artagnan
and
saw
that
he
was
not
speaking
the
truth
but
baisemeaux
had
eyes
for
nothing
but
d
artagnan
so
great
was
his
admiration
for
a
man
who
seemed
to
make
the
king
do
all
he
wished
and
does
the
king
exile
athos
inquired
aramis
no
not
precisely
the
king
did
not
explain
himself
upon
that
subject
replied
d
artagnan
but
i
think
the
comte
could
not
well
do
better
unless
indeed
he
wishes
particularly
to
thank
the
king
no
indeed
replied
athos
smiling
well
then
i
think
resumed
d
artagnan
that
the
comte
can
not
do
better
than
to
retire
to
his
chateau
however
my
dear
athos
you
have
only
to
speak
to
tell
me
what
you
want
if
any
particular
place
of
residence
is
more
agreeable
to
you
than
another
i
am
influential
enough
perhaps
to
obtain
it
for
no
thank
you
said
athos
nothing
can
be
more
agreeable
to
me
my
dear
friend
than
to
return
to
my
solitude
beneath
my
noble
trees
on
the
banks
of
the
loire
if
heaven
be
the
overruling
physician
of
the
evils
of
the
mind
nature
is
a
sovereign
remedy
and
so
monsieur
continued
athos
turning
again
towards
baisemeaux
i
am
now
free
i
suppose
yes
monsieur
le
comte
i
think
so
at
least
i
hope
so
said
the
governor
turning
over
and
over
the
two
papers
in
question
unless
however
d
artagnan
has
a
third
order
to
give
no
my
dear
baisemeaux
no
said
the
musketeer
the
second
is
quite
enough
we
will
stop
there
if
you
ah
monsieur
le
comte
said
baisemeaux
addressing
athos
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
losing
i
should
have
placed
you
among
the
prisoners
like
the
generals
what
am
i
saying
i
mean
among
the
like
the
princes
and
you
would
have
supped
every
evening
as
you
have
done
allow
me
monsieur
said
athos
to
prefer
my
own
simpler
and
then
turning
to
d
artagnan
he
said
let
us
go
my
dear
friend
shall
i
have
that
greatest
of
all
pleasures
for
me
that
of
having
you
as
my
companion
to
the
city
gate
only
replied
d
artagnan
after
which
i
will
tell
you
what
i
told
the
king
i
am
on
and
you
my
dear
aramis
said
athos
smiling
will
you
accompany
me
la
fere
is
on
the
road
to
thank
you
my
dear
friend
said
aramis
but
i
have
an
appointment
in
paris
this
evening
and
i
can
not
leave
without
very
serious
interests
suffering
by
my
in
that
case
said
athos
i
must
say
adieu
and
take
my
leave
of
you
my
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
i
have
to
thank
you
exceedingly
for
your
kind
and
friendly
disposition
towards
me
and
particularly
for
the
enjoyable
specimen
you
have
given
me
of
the
ordinary
fare
of
the
and
having
embraced
aramis
and
shaken
hands
with
de
baisemeaux
and
having
received
best
wishes
for
a
pleasant
journey
from
them
both
athos
set
off
with
d
artagnan
whilst
the
of
the
scene
of
the
palais
royal
was
taking
place
at
the
bastile
let
us
relate
what
was
going
on
at
the
lodgings
of
athos
and
bragelonne
grimaud
as
we
have
seen
had
accompanied
his
master
to
paris
and
as
we
have
said
he
was
present
when
athos
went
out
he
had
observed
d
artagnan
gnaw
the
corners
of
his
mustache
he
had
seen
his
master
get
into
the
carriage
he
had
narrowly
examined
both
their
countenances
and
he
had
known
them
both
for
a
sufficiently
long
period
to
read
and
understand
through
the
mask
of
their
impassibility
that
something
serious
was
the
matter
as
soon
as
athos
had
gone
he
began
to
reflect
he
then
and
then
only
remembered
the
strange
manner
in
which
athos
had
taken
leave
of
him
the
embarrassment
imperceptible
as
it
would
have
been
to
any
but
himself
of
the
master
whose
ideas
were
to
him
so
clear
and
defined
and
the
expression
of
whose
wishes
was
so
precise
he
knew
that
athos
had
taken
nothing
with
him
but
the
clothes
he
had
on
him
at
the
time
and
yet
he
seemed
to
fancy
that
athos
had
not
left
for
an
hour
merely
or
even
for
a
day
a
long
absence
was
signified
by
the
manner
in
which
he
pronounced
the
word
all
these
circumstances
recurred
to
his
mind
with
feelings
of
deep
affection
for
athos
with
that
horror
of
isolation
and
solitude
which
invariably
besets
the
minds
of
those
who
love
and
all
these
combined
rendered
poor
grimaud
very
melancholy
and
particularly
uneasy
without
being
able
to
account
to
himself
for
what
he
did
since
his
master
s
departure
he
wandered
about
the
room
seeking
as
it
were
for
some
traces
of
him
like
a
faithful
dog
who
is
not
exactly
uneasy
about
his
absent
master
but
at
least
is
restless
only
as
in
addition
to
the
instinct
of
the
animal
grimaud
subjoined
the
reasoning
faculties
of
the
man
grimaud
therefore
felt
uneasy
and
restless
too
not
having
found
any
indication
which
could
serve
as
a
guide
and
having
neither
seen
nor
discovered
anything
which
could
satisfy
his
doubts
grimaud
began
to
wonder
what
could
possibly
have
happened
besides
imagination
is
the
resource
or
rather
the
plague
of
gentle
and
affectionate
hearts
in
fact
never
does
a
feeling
heart
represent
its
absent
friend
to
itself
as
being
happy
or
cheerful
never
does
the
dove
that
wings
its
flight
in
search
of
adventures
inspire
anything
but
terror
at
home
grimaud
soon
passed
from
uneasiness
to
terror
he
carefully
went
over
in
his
own
mind
everything
that
had
taken
place
d
artagnan
s
letter
to
athos
the
letter
which
had
seemed
to
distress
athos
so
much
after
he
had
read
it
then
raoul
s
visit
to
athos
which
resulted
in
athos
desiring
him
grimaud
to
get
his
various
orders
and
his
court
dress
ready
to
put
on
then
his
interview
with
the
king
at
the
end
of
which
athos
had
returned
home
so
unusually
gloomy
then
the
explanation
between
the
father
and
the
son
at
the
termination
of
which
athos
had
embraced
raoul
with
such
sadness
of
expression
while
raoul
himself
went
away
equally
weary
and
melancholy
and
finally
d
artagnan
s
arrival
biting
as
if
he
were
vexed
the
end
of
his
mustache
and
leaving
again
in
the
carriage
accompanied
by
the
comte
de
la
fere
all
this
composed
a
drama
in
five
acts
very
clearly
particularly
for
so
analytical
an
observer
as
grimaud
the
first
step
he
took
was
to
search
in
his
master
s
coat
for
d
artagnan
s
letter
he
found
the
letter
still
there
and
its
contents
were
found
to
run
as
follows
my
dear
friend
raoul
has
been
to
ask
me
for
some
particulars
about
the
conduct
of
mademoiselle
de
la
valliere
during
our
young
friend
s
residence
in
london
i
am
a
poor
captain
of
musketeers
and
i
am
sickened
to
death
every
day
by
hearing
all
the
scandal
of
the
barracks
and
bedside
conversations
if
i
had
told
raoul
all
i
believe
i
know
the
poor
fellow
would
have
died
of
it
but
i
am
in
the
king
s
service
and
can
not
relate
all
i
hear
about
the
king
s
affairs
if
your
heart
tells
you
to
do
it
set
off
at
once
the
matter
concerns
you
more
than
it
does
myself
and
almost
as
much
as
grimaud
tore
not
a
handful
but
a
of
hair
out
of
his
head
he
would
have
done
more
if
his
head
of
hair
had
been
in
a
more
flourishing
condition
yes
he
said
that
is
the
key
of
the
whole
enigma
the
young
girl
has
been
playing
her
pranks
what
people
say
about
her
and
the
king
is
true
then
our
young
master
has
been
deceived
he
ought
to
know
it
monsieur
le
comte
has
been
to
see
the
king
and
has
told
him
a
piece
of
his
mind
and
then
the
king
sent
d
artagnan
to
arrange
the
affair
ah
gracious
goodness
continued
grimaud
monsieur
le
comte
i
now
remember
returned
without
his
this
discovery
made
the
perspiration
break
out
all
over
poor
grimaud
s
face
he
did
not
waste
any
more
time
in
useless
conjecture
but
clapped
his
hat
on
his
head
and
ran
to
raoul
s
lodgings
raoul
after
louise
had
left
him
had
mastered
his
grief
if
not
his
affection
and
compelled
to
look
forward
on
that
perilous
road
over
which
madness
and
revulsion
were
hurrying
him
he
had
seen
from
the
very
first
glance
his
father
exposed
to
the
royal
obstinacy
since
athos
had
himself
been
the
first
to
oppose
any
resistance
to
the
royal
will
at
this
moment
from
a
very
natural
sequence
of
feeling
the
unhappy
young
man
remembered
the
mysterious
signs
which
athos
had
made
and
the
unexpected
visit
of
d
artagnan
the
result
of
the
conflict
between
a
sovereign
and
a
subject
revealed
itself
to
his
terrified
vision
as
d
artagnan
was
on
duty
that
is
a
fixture
at
his
post
without
the
possibility
of
leaving
it
it
was
certainly
not
likely
that
he
had
come
to
pay
athos
a
visit
merely
for
the
pleasure
of
seeing
him
he
must
have
come
to
say
something
to
him
this
something
in
the
midst
of
such
painful
conjectures
must
have
been
the
news
of
either
a
misfortune
or
a
danger
raoul
trembled
at
having
been
so
selfish
as
to
have
forgotten
his
father
for
his
affection
at
having
in
a
word
passed
his
time
in
idle
dreams
or
in
an
indulgence
of
despair
at
a
time
when
a
necessity
existed
for
repelling
such
an
imminent
attack
on
athos
the
very
idea
nearly
drove
him
frantic
he
buckled
on
his
sword
and
ran
towards
his
father
s
lodgings
on
his
way
there
he
encountered
grimaud
who
having
set
off
from
the
opposite
pole
was
running
with
equal
eagerness
in
search
of
the
truth
the
two
men
embraced
each
other
most
warmly
grimaud
exclaimed
raoul
is
the
comte
well
have
you
seen
him
no
where
is
he
i
am
trying
to
find
and
d
artagnan
went
out
with
when
ten
minutes
after
you
in
what
way
did
they
go
out
in
a
where
did
they
go
i
have
no
idea
at
did
my
father
take
any
money
with
him
or
his
sword
i
have
an
idea
grimaud
that
d
artagnan
came
in
order
to
arrest
monsieur
le
comte
do
you
not
think
monsieur
yes
i
could
have
sworn
what
road
did
they
take
the
way
leading
towards
the
to
the
bastile
then
yes
quick
quick
let
us
yes
let
us
not
lose
a
but
where
are
we
to
go
said
raoul
overwhelmed
we
will
go
to
d
artagnan
s
first
we
may
perhaps
learn
something
no
if
they
keep
me
in
ignorance
at
my
father
s
they
will
do
the
same
everywhere
let
us
go
to
oh
good
heavens
why
i
must
be
mad
grimaud
i
have
forgotten
du
vallon
who
is
waiting
for
and
expecting
me
where
is
he
then
at
the
minimes
of
thank
goodness
that
is
on
the
same
side
as
the
bastile
i
will
run
and
saddle
the
horses
and
we
will
go
at
once
said
grimaud
do
my
friend
chapter
lxvi
in
which
porthos
is
convinced
without
having
understood
anything
the
good
and
worthy
porthos
faithful
to
all
the
laws
of
ancient
chivalry
had
determined
to
wait
for
de
until
sunset
and
as
did
not
come
as
raoul
had
forgotten
to
communicate
with
his
second
and
as
he
found
that
waiting
so
long
was
very
wearisome
porthos
had
desired
one
of
the
to
fetch
him
a
few
bottles
of
good
wine
and
a
good
joint
of
meat
so
that
at
least
he
might
pass
away
the
time
by
means
of
a
glass
or
two
and
a
mouthful
of
something
to
eat
he
had
just
finished
when
raoul
arrived
escorted
by
grimaud
both
of
them
riding
at
full
speed
as
soon
as
porthos
saw
the
two
cavaliers
riding
at
such
a
pace
along
the
road
he
did
not
for
a
moment
doubt
but
that
they
were
the
men
he
was
expecting
and
he
rose
from
the
grass
upon
which
he
had
been
indolently
reclining
and
began
to
stretch
his
legs
and
arms
saying
see
what
it
is
to
have
good
habits
the
fellow
has
finished
by
coming
after
all
if
i
had
gone
away
he
would
have
found
no
one
here
and
would
have
taken
advantage
of
he
then
threw
himself
into
a
martial
attitude
and
drew
himself
up
to
the
full
height
of
his
gigantic
stature
but
instead
of
he
only
saw
raoul
who
with
the
most
despairing
gestures
accosted
him
by
crying
out
pray
forgive
me
my
dear
friend
i
am
most
raoul
cried
porthos
surprised
you
have
been
angry
with
me
said
raoul
embracing
porthos
i
what
for
for
having
forgotten
you
but
i
assure
you
my
head
seems
utterly
lost
if
you
only
knew
you
have
killed
him
who
or
if
that
is
not
the
case
what
is
the
matter
the
matter
is
that
monsieur
le
comte
de
la
fere
has
by
this
time
been
porthos
gave
a
start
that
would
have
thrown
down
a
wall
arrested
he
cried
out
by
whom
by
d
it
is
impossible
said
porthos
my
dear
friend
it
is
perfectly
porthos
turned
towards
grimaud
as
if
he
needed
a
second
confirmation
of
the
intelligence
grimaud
nodded
his
head
and
where
have
they
taken
him
probably
to
the
what
makes
you
think
that
as
we
came
along
we
questioned
some
persons
who
saw
the
carriage
pass
and
others
who
saw
it
enter
the
oh
muttered
porthos
what
do
you
intend
to
do
inquired
raoul
i
nothing
only
i
will
not
have
athos
remain
at
the
do
you
know
said
raoul
advancing
nearer
to
porthos
that
the
arrest
was
made
by
order
of
the
king
porthos
looked
at
the
young
man
as
if
to
say
what
does
that
matter
to
me
this
dumb
language
seemed
so
eloquent
of
meaning
to
raoul
that
he
did
not
ask
any
other
question
he
mounted
his
horse
again
and
porthos
assisted
by
grimaud
had
already
done
the
same
let
us
arrange
our
plan
of
action
said
raoul
yes
returned
porthos
that
is
the
best
thing
we
can
raoul
sighed
deeply
and
then
paused
suddenly
what
is
the
matter
asked
porthos
are
you
faint
no
only
i
feel
how
utterly
helpless
our
position
is
can
we
three
pretend
to
go
and
take
the
bastile
well
if
d
artagnan
were
only
here
replied
porthos
i
am
not
so
very
certain
we
would
raoul
could
not
resist
a
feeling
of
admiration
at
the
sight
of
such
perfect
confidence
heroic
in
its
simplicity
these
were
truly
the
celebrated
men
who
by
three
or
four
attacked
armies
and
assaulted
castles
men
who
had
terrified
death
itself
who
had
survived
the
wrecks
of
a
tempestuous
age
and
still
stood
stronger
than
the
most
robust
of
the
young
monsieur
said
he
to
porthos
you
have
just
given
me
an
idea
we
absolutely
must
see
d
he
ought
by
this
time
to
have
returned
home
after
having
taken
my
father
to
the
bastile
let
us
go
to
his
first
inquire
at
the
bastile
said
grimaud
who
was
in
the
habit
of
speaking
little
but
that
to
the
purpose
accordingly
they
hastened
towards
the
fortress
when
one
of
those
chances
which
heaven
bestows
on
men
of
strong
will
caused
grimaud
suddenly
to
perceive
the
carriage
which
was
entering
by
the
great
gate
of
the
drawbridge
this
was
the
moment
that
d
artagnan
was
as
we
have
seen
returning
from
his
visit
to
the
king
in
vain
was
it
that
raoul
urged
on
his
horse
in
order
to
join
the
carriage
and
to
see
whom
it
contained
the
horses
had
already
gained
the
other
side
of
the
great
gate
which
again
closed
while
one
of
the
sentries
struck
the
nose
of
raoul
s
horse
with
his
musket
raoul
turned
about
only
too
happy
to
find
he
had
ascertained
something
respecting
the
carriage
which
had
contained
his
father
we
have
him
said
grimaud
if
we
wait
a
little
it
is
certain
he
will
leave
don
t
you
think
so
my
friend
unless
indeed
d
artagnan
also
be
a
prisoner
replied
porthos
in
which
case
everything
is
raoul
returned
no
answer
for
any
hypothesis
was
admissible
he
instructed
grimaud
to
lead
the
horses
to
the
little
street
so
as
to
give
rise
to
less
suspicion
and
himself
with
his
piercing
gaze
watched
for
the
exit
either
of
d
artagnan
or
the
carriage
nor
had
he
decided
wrongly
for
twenty
minutes
had
not
elapsed
before
the
gate
reopened
and
the
carriage
reappeared
a
dazzling
of
the
eyes
prevented
raoul
from
distinguishing
what
figures
occupied
the
interior
grimaud
averred
that
he
had
seen
two
persons
and
that
one
of
them
was
his
master
porthos
kept
looking
at
raoul
and
grimaud
by
turns
in
the
hope
of
understanding
their
idea
it
is
clear
said
grimaud
that
if
the
comte
is
in
the
carriage
either
he
is
set
at
liberty
or
they
are
taking
him
to
another
we
shall
soon
see
that
by
the
road
he
takes
answered
porthos
if
he
is
set
at
liberty
said
grimaud
they
will
conduct
him
true
rejoined
porthos
the
carriage
does
not
take
that
way
cried
raoul
and
indeed
the
horses
were
just
disappearing
down
the
faubourg
antoine
let
us
hasten
said
porthos
we
will
attack
the
carriage
on
the
road
and
tell
athos
to
rebellion
murmured
raoul
porthos
darted
a
second
glance
at
raoul
quite
worthy
of
the
first
raoul
replied
only
by
spurring
the
flanks
of
his
steed
in
a
few
moments
the
three
cavaliers
had
overtaken
the
carriage
and
followed
it
so
closely
that
their
horses
breath
moistened
the
back
of
it
d
artagnan
whose
senses
were
ever
on
the
alert
heard
the
trot
of
the
horses
at
the
moment
when
raoul
was
telling
porthos
to
pass
the
chariot
so
as
to
see
who
was
the
person
accompanying
athos
porthos
complied
but
could
not
see
anything
for
the
blinds
were
lowered
rage
and
impatience
were
gaining
mastery
over
raoul
he
had
just
noticed
the
mystery
preserved
by
athos
s
companion
and
determined
on
proceeding
to
extremities
on
his
part
d
artagnan
had
perfectly
recognized
porthos
and
raoul
also
from
under
the
blinds
and
had
communicated
to
the
comte
the
result
of
his
observation
they
were
desirous
only
of
seeing
whether
raoul
and
porthos
would
push
the
affair
to
the
uttermost
and
this
they
speedily
did
for
raoul
presenting
his
pistol
threw
himself
on
the
leader
commanding
the
coachmen
to
stop
porthos
seized
the
coachman
and
dragged
him
from
his
seat
grimaud
already
had
hold
of
the
carriage
door
raoul
threw
open
his
arms
exclaiming
m
le
comte
le
comte
ah
is
it
you
raoul
said
athos
intoxicated
with
joy
not
bad
indeed
added
d
artagnan
with
a
burst
of
laughter
and
they
both
embraced
the
young
man
and
porthos
who
had
taken
possession
of
them
my
brave
porthos
best
of
friends
cried
athos
it
is
still
the
same
old
way
with
he
is
still
only
twenty
said
d
artagnan
brave
porthos
confound
it
answered
porthos
slightly
confused
we
thought
that
you
were
being
while
rejoined
athos
the
matter
in
question
was
nothing
but
my
taking
a
drive
in
d
artagnan
s
but
we
followed
you
from
the
bastile
returned
raoul
with
a
tone
of
suspicion
and
reproach
where
we
had
been
to
take
supper
with
our
friend
baisemeaux
do
you
recollect
baisemeaux
porthos
very
well
and
there
we
saw
in
the
bastile
at
ah
said
porthos
again
breathing
freely
he
gave
us
a
thousand
messages
to
and
where
is
le
comte
going
asked
grimaud
already
recompensed
by
a
smile
from
his
master
we
were
going
home
to
how
can
that
be
at
once
said
raoul
yes
right
without
any
luggage
oh
raoul
would
have
been
instructed
to
forward
me
mine
or
to
bring
it
with
him
on
his
return
he
if
nothing
detains
him
longer
in
paris
said
d
artagnan
with
a
glance
firm
and
cutting
as
steel
and
as
painful
for
it
reopened
the
poor
young
fellow
s
wounds
he
will
do
well
to
follow
you
there
is
nothing
to
keep
me
any
longer
in
paris
said
raoul
then
we
will
go
and
d
artagnan
oh
as
for
me
i
was
only
accompanying
athos
as
far
as
the
barrier
and
i
return
with
very
good
said
the
latter
come
my
son
added
the
comte
gently
passing
his
arm
around
raoul
s
neck
to
draw
him
into
the
carriage
and
again
embracing
him
grimaud
continued
the
comte
you
will
return
quietly
to
paris
with
your
horse
and
du
vallon
s
for
raoul
and
i
will
mount
here
and
give
up
the
carriage
to
these
two
gentlemen
to
return
to
paris
in
and
then
as
soon
as
you
arrive
you
will
take
my
clothes
and
letters
and
forward
the
whole
to
me
at
but
observed
raoul
who
was
anxious
to
make
the
comte
converse
when
you
return
to
paris
there
will
not
be
a
single
thing
there
for
you
which
will
be
very
i
think
it
will
be
a
very
long
time
raoul
ere
i
return
to
paris
the
last
sojourn
we
have
made
there
has
not
been
of
a
nature
to
encourage
me
to
repeat
raoul
hung
down
his
head
and
said
not
a
word
more
athos
descended
from
the
carriage
and
mounted
the
horse
which
had
brought
porthos
and
which
seemed
no
little
pleased
at
the
exchange
then
they
embraced
and
clasped
each
other
s
hands
and
interchanged
a
thousand
pledges
of
eternal
friendship
porthos
promised
to
spend
a
month
with
athos
at
the
first
opportunity
d
artagnan
engaged
to
take
advantage
of
his
first
leave
of
absence
and
then
having
embraced
raoul
for
the
last
time
to
you
my
boy
said
he
i
will
coming
from
d
artagnan
who
he
knew
wrote
very
seldom
these
words
expressed
everything
raoul
was
moved
even
to
tears
he
tore
himself
away
from
the
musketeer
and
departed
d
artagnan
rejoined
porthos
in
the
carriage
well
said
he
my
dear
friend
what
a
day
we
have
had
indeed
we
have
answered
porthos
you
must
be
quite
worn
not
quite
however
i
shall
retire
early
to
rest
so
as
to
be
ready
for
and
wherefore
why
to
complete
what
i
have
you
make
me
shudder
my
friend
you
seem
to
me
quite
angry
what
the
devil
you
begun
which
is
not
finished
listen
raoul
has
not
fought
but
must
fight
with
whom
with
the
king
how
exclaimed
porthos
astounded
with
the
king
yes
i
say
you
great
baby
with
the
i
assure
you
it
is
with
look
now
this
is
what
i
mean
you
draw
your
sword
against
the
king
in
fighting
with
this
ah
said
porthos
staring
are
you
sure
of
it
indeed
i
what
in
the
world
are
we
to
do
then
we
must
try
and
make
a
good
supper
porthos
the
captain
of
the
musketeers
keeps
a
tolerable
table
there
you
will
see
the
handsome
and
will
drink
his
i
cried
porthos
horrified
what
said
d
artagnan
you
refuse
to
drink
the
king
s
health
but
body
alive
i
am
not
talking
to
you
about
the
king
at
all
i
am
speaking
of
de
but
when
i
repeat
that
it
is
the
same
thing
ah
well
well
said
porthos
overcome
you
understand
don
t
you
no
answered
porthos
but
tis
all
the
chapter
lxvii
de
baisemeaux
s
the
reader
has
not
forgotten
that
on
quitting
the
bastile
d
artagnan
and
the
comte
de
la
fere
had
left
aramis
in
close
confabulation
with
baisemeaux
when
once
these
two
guests
had
departed
baisemeaux
did
not
in
the
least
perceive
that
the
conversation
suffered
by
their
absence
he
used
to
think
that
wine
after
supper
and
that
of
the
bastile
in
particular
was
excellent
and
that
it
was
a
stimulation
quite
sufficient
to
make
any
honest
man
talkative
but
he
little
knew
his
greatness
who
was
never
more
impenetrable
than
at
dessert
his
greatness
however
perfectly
understood
de
baisemeaux
when
he
reckoned
on
making
the
governor
discourse
by
the
means
which
the
latter
regarded
as
efficacious
the
conversation
therefore
without
flagging
in
appearance
flagged
in
reality
for
baisemeaux
not
only
had
it
nearly
all
to
himself
but
further
kept
speaking
only
of
that
singular
event
the
incarceration
of
athos
followed
by
so
prompt
an
order
to
set
him
again
at
liberty
nor
moreover
had
baisemeaux
failed
to
observe
that
the
two
orders
of
arrest
and
of
liberation
were
both
in
the
king
s
hand
but
then
the
king
would
not
take
the
trouble
to
write
similar
orders
except
under
pressing
circumstances
all
this
was
very
interesting
and
above
all
very
puzzling
to
baisemeaux
but
as
on
the
other
hand
all
this
was
very
clear
to
aramis
the
latter
did
not
attach
to
the
occurrence
the
same
importance
as
did
the
worthy
governor
besides
aramis
rarely
put
himself
out
of
the
way
for
anything
and
he
had
not
yet
told
de
baisemeaux
for
what
reason
he
had
now
done
so
and
so
at
the
very
climax
of
baisemeaux
s
dissertation
aramis
suddenly
interrupted
him
tell
me
my
dear
baisemeaux
said
he
have
you
never
had
any
other
diversions
at
the
bastile
than
those
at
which
i
assisted
during
the
two
or
three
visits
i
have
had
the
honor
to
pay
you
this
address
was
so
unexpected
that
the
governor
like
a
vane
which
suddenly
receives
an
impulsion
opposed
to
that
of
the
wind
was
quite
dumbfounded
at
it
diversions
said
he
but
i
take
them
continually
oh
to
be
sure
and
these
diversions
are
of
every
visits
no
doubt
no
not
visits
visits
are
not
frequent
at
the
what
are
visits
rare
then
very
much
even
on
the
part
of
your
society
what
do
you
term
my
society
the
prisoners
oh
no
your
prisoners
indeed
i
know
well
it
is
you
who
visit
them
and
not
they
you
by
your
society
i
mean
my
dear
baisemeaux
the
society
of
which
you
are
a
baisemeaux
looked
fixedly
at
aramis
and
then
as
if
the
idea
which
had
flashed
across
his
mind
were
impossible
oh
he
said
i
have
very
little
society
at
present
if
i
must
own
it
to
you
dear
d
herblay
the
fact
is
to
stay
at
the
bastile
appears
for
the
most
part
distressing
and
distasteful
to
persons
of
the
gay
world
as
for
the
ladies
it
is
never
without
a
certain
dread
which
costs
me
infinite
trouble
to
allay
that
they
succeed
in
reaching
my
quarters
and
indeed
how
should
they
avoid
trembling
a
little
poor
things
when
they
see
those
gloomy
dungeons
and
reflect
that
they
are
inhabited
by
prisoners
who
and
in
proportion
as
the
eyes
of
baisemeaux
concentrated
their
gaze
on
the
face
of
aramis
the
worthy
governor
s
tongue
faltered
more
and
more
until
it
ended
by
stopping
altogether
no
you
don
t
understand
me
my
dear
baisemeaux
you
don
t
understand
me
i
do
not
at
all
mean
to
speak
of
society
in
general
but
of
a
particular
society
of
society
in
a
word
to
which
you
are
baisemeaux
nearly
dropped
the
glass
of
muscat
which
he
was
in
the
act
of
raising
to
his
lips
affiliated
cried
he
affiliated
yes
affiliated
undoubtedly
repeated
aramis
with
the
greatest
are
you
not
a
member
of
a
secret
society
my
dear
baisemeaux
secret
secret
or
oh
d
herblay
consider
now
don
t
deny
but
believe
i
believe
what
i
i
swear
to
listen
to
me
my
dear
baisemeaux
i
say
yes
you
say
no
one
of
us
two
necessarily
says
what
is
true
and
the
other
it
inevitably
follows
what
is
well
and
then
well
we
shall
come
to
an
understanding
let
us
see
said
baisemeaux
let
us
now
drink
your
glass
of
muscat
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
said
aramis
what
the
devil
you
look
quite
no
no
not
the
least
in
the
world
oh
drink
baisemeaux
drank
but
he
swallowed
the
wrong
way
well
resumed
aramis
if
i
say
you
are
not
a
member
of
a
secret
or
mysterious
society
which
you
like
to
call
it
the
epithet
is
of
no
consequence
if
i
say
you
are
not
a
member
of
a
society
similar
to
that
i
wish
to
designate
well
then
you
will
not
understand
a
word
of
what
i
am
going
to
say
that
is
oh
be
sure
beforehand
that
i
shall
not
understand
well
well
try
now
let
us
see
that
is
what
i
am
going
to
if
on
the
contrary
you
are
one
of
the
members
of
this
society
you
will
immediately
answer
me
yes
or
begin
your
questions
continued
baisemeaux
trembling
you
will
agree
dear
monsieur
de
baisemeaux
continued
aramis
with
the
same
impassibility
that
it
is
evident
a
man
can
not
be
a
member
of
a
society
it
is
evident
that
he
can
not
enjoy
the
advantages
it
offers
to
the
affiliated
without
being
himself
bound
to
certain
little
in
short
stammered
baisemeaux
that
would
be
intelligible
if
well
resumed
aramis
there
is
in
the
society
of
which
i
speak
and
of
which
as
it
seems
you
are
not
a
member
allow
me
said
baisemeaux
i
should
not
like
to
say
there
is
an
engagement
entered
into
by
all
the
governors
and
captains
of
fortresses
affiliated
to
the
baisemeaux
grew
pale
now
the
engagement
continued
aramis
firmly
is
of
this
baisemeaux
rose
manifesting
unspeakable
emotion
go
on
dear
d
herblay
go
on
said
he
aramis
then
spoke
or
rather
recited
the
following
paragraph
in
the
same
tone
as
if
he
had
been
reading
it
from
a
book
the
aforesaid
captain
or
governor
of
a
fortress
shall
allow
to
enter
when
need
shall
arise
and
on
demand
of
the
prisoner
a
confessor
affiliated
to
the
he
stopped
baisemeaux
was
quite
distressing
to
look
at
being
so
wretchedly
pale
and
trembling
is
not
that
the
text
of
the
agreement
quietly
asked
aramis
monseigneur
began
baisemeaux
ah
well
you
begin
to
understand
i
monseigneur
cried
baisemeaux
do
not
trifle
so
with
my
unhappy
mind
i
find
myself
as
nothing
in
your
hands
if
you
have
the
malignant
desire
to
draw
from
me
the
little
secrets
of
my
oh
by
no
means
pray
undeceive
yourself
dear
baisemeaux
it
is
not
the
little
secrets
of
your
administration
but
those
of
your
conscience
that
i
aim
well
then
my
conscience
be
it
dear
d
herblay
but
have
some
consideration
for
the
situation
i
am
in
which
is
no
ordinary
it
is
no
ordinary
one
my
dear
monsieur
continued
the
inflexible
aramis
if
you
are
a
member
of
this
society
but
it
is
a
quite
natural
one
if
free
from
all
engagement
you
are
answerable
only
to
the
well
monsieur
well
i
obey
only
the
king
and
whom
else
would
you
have
a
french
nobleman
obey
aramis
did
not
yield
an
inch
but
with
that
silvery
voice
of
his
continued
it
is
very
pleasant
said
he
for
a
french
nobleman
for
a
prelate
of
france
to
hear
a
man
of
your
mark
express
himself
so
loyally
dear
de
baisemeaux
and
having
heard
you
to
believe
no
more
than
you
have
you
doubted
monsieur
i
oh
no
and
so
you
doubt
no
longer
i
have
no
longer
any
doubt
that
such
a
man
as
you
monsieur
said
aramis
gravely
does
not
faithfully
serve
the
masters
whom
he
voluntarily
chose
for
masters
cried
baisemeaux
yes
masters
i
monsieur
d
herblay
you
are
still
jesting
are
you
not
oh
yes
i
understand
that
it
is
a
more
difficult
position
to
have
several
masters
than
one
but
the
embarrassment
is
owing
to
you
my
dear
baisemeaux
and
i
am
not
the
cause
of
certainly
not
returned
the
unfortunate
governor
more
embarrassed
than
ever
but
what
are
you
doing
you
are
leaving
the
table
are
you
going
yes
i
am
but
you
are
behaving
very
strangely
towards
me
i
am
behaving
strangely
how
do
you
make
that
out
have
you
sworn
then
to
put
me
to
the
torture
no
i
should
be
sorry
to
do
remain
i
can
not
and
why
because
i
have
no
longer
anything
to
do
here
and
indeed
i
have
duties
to
fulfil
duties
so
late
as
this
yes
understand
me
now
my
dear
de
baisemeaux
they
told
me
at
the
place
whence
i
came
the
aforesaid
governor
or
captain
will
allow
to
enter
as
need
shall
arise
on
the
prisoner
s
demand
a
confessor
affiliated
with
the
i
came
you
do
not
know
what
i
mean
and
so
i
shall
return
to
tell
them
that
they
are
mistaken
and
that
they
must
send
me
what
you
are
cried
baisemeaux
looking
at
aramis
almost
in
terror
the
confessor
affiliated
to
the
order
said
aramis
without
changing
his
voice
but
gentle
as
the
words
were
they
had
the
same
effect
on
the
unhappy
governor
as
a
clap
of
thunder
baisemeaux
became
livid
and
it
seemed
to
him
as
if
aramis
s
beaming
eyes
were
two
forks
of
flame
piercing
to
the
very
bottom
of
his
soul
the
confessor
murmured
he
you
monseigneur
the
confessor
of
the
order
yes
i
but
we
have
nothing
to
unravel
together
seeing
that
you
are
not
one
of
the
monseigneur
and
i
understand
that
not
being
so
you
refuse
to
comply
with
its
monseigneur
i
beseech
you
condescend
to
hear
and
wherefore
monseigneur
i
do
not
say
that
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
ah
ah
i
say
not
that
i
refuse
to
nevertheless
de
baisemeaux
what
has
passed
wears
very
much
the
air
of
oh
no
monseigneur
no
i
only
wished
to
be
to
be
certain
of
what
said
aramis
in
a
tone
of
supreme
contempt
of
nothing
at
all
baisemeaux
lowered
his
voice
and
bending
before
the
prelate
said
i
am
at
all
times
and
in
all
places
at
the
disposal
of
my
superiors
but
very
good
i
like
you
better
thus
monsieur
said
aramis
as
he
resumed
his
seat
and
put
out
his
glass
to
baisemeaux
whose
hand
trembled
so
that
he
could
not
fill
it
you
were
saying
but
continued
aramis
but
replied
the
unhappy
man
having
received
no
notice
i
was
very
far
from
expecting
does
not
the
gospel
say
watch
for
the
moment
is
known
only
of
god
do
not
the
rules
of
the
order
say
watch
for
that
which
i
will
you
ought
always
to
will
and
what
pretext
will
serve
you
now
that
you
did
not
expect
the
confessor
de
baisemeaux
because
monseigneur
there
is
at
present
in
the
bastile
no
prisoner
aramis
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
do
you
know
about
that
said
he
but
nevertheless
it
appears
to
me
m
de
baisemeaux
said
aramis
turning
round
in
his
chair
here
is
your
servant
who
wishes
to
speak
with
you
and
at
this
moment
de
baisemeaux
s
servant
appeared
at
the
threshold
of
the
door
what
is
it
asked
baisemeaux
sharply
monsieur
said
the
man
they
are
bringing
you
the
doctor
s
aramis
looked
at
de
baisemeaux
with
a
calm
and
confident
eye
well
said
he
let
the
messenger
the
messenger
entered
saluted
and
handed
in
the
report
baisemeaux
ran
his
eye
over
it
and
raising
his
head
said
in
surprise
no
is
ill
how
was
it
then
said
aramis
carelessly
that
you
told
me
everybody
was
well
in
your
hotel
de
baisemeaux
and
he
emptied
his
glass
without
removing
his
eyes
from
baisemeaux
the
governor
then
made
a
sign
to
the
messenger
and
when
he
had
quitted
the
room
said
still
trembling
i
think
that
there
is
in
the
article
on
the
prisoner
s
yes
it
is
so
answered
aramis
but
see
what
it
is
they
want
with
you
and
that
moment
a
sergeant
put
his
head
in
at
the
door
what
do
you
want
now
cried
baisemeaux
can
you
not
leave
me
in
peace
for
ten
minutes
monsieur
said
the
sergeant
the
sick
man
no
has
commissioned
the
turnkey
to
request
you
to
send
him
a
baisemeaux
very
nearly
sank
on
the
floor
but
aramis
disdained
to
reassure
him
just
as
he
had
disdained
to
terrify
him
what
must
i
answer
inquired
baisemeaux
just
what
you
please
replied
aramis
compressing
his
lips
that
is
your
business
am
not
the
governor
of
the
tell
the
prisoner
cried
baisemeaux
quickly
tell
the
prisoner
that
his
request
is
the
sergeant
left
the
room
oh
monseigneur
monseigneur
murmured
baisemeaux
how
could
i
have
suspected
how
could
i
have
foreseen
this
who
requested
you
to
suspect
and
who
besought
you
to
foresee
contemptuously
answered
aramis
the
order

the
order

the
order

is
that
not
enough
what
is
it
you
command
added
baisemeaux
i
nothing
at
all
i
am
nothing
but
a
poor

a
simple

your
orders
