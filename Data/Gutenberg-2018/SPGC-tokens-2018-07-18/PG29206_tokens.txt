world
had
collapsed
around
this
man
a
world
that
would
never
shout
his
praises
again
the
cities
were
still
and
dead
the
twisted
bodies
and
twisted
souls
giving
him
their
last
salute
in
death
and
now
he
was
alone
alone
surrounded
by
memories
alone
and
waiting
happy
ending
mack
reynolds
and
fredric
sometimes
the
queerly
shaped
venusian
trees
seemed
to
talk
to
him
but
their
voices
were
soft
they
were
loyal
people
there
were
four
men
in
the
lifeboat
that
came
down
from
the
three
of
them
were
still
in
the
uniform
of
the
galactic
guards
the
fourth
sat
in
the
prow
of
the
small
craft
looking
down
at
their
goal
hunched
and
silent
bundled
up
in
a
greatcoat
against
the
coolness
of
space
a
greatcoat
which
he
would
never
need
again
after
this
morning
the
brim
of
his
hat
was
pulled
down
far
over
his
forehead
and
he
studied
the
nearing
shore
through
glasses
bandages
as
though
for
a
broken
jaw
covered
most
of
the
lower
part
of
his
face
he
realized
suddenly
that
the
dark
glasses
now
that
they
had
left
the
cruiser
were
unnecessary
he
slipped
them
off
after
the
cinematographic
grays
his
eyes
had
seen
through
these
lenses
for
so
long
the
brilliance
of
the
color
below
him
was
almost
like
a
blow
he
blinked
and
looked
again
they
were
rapidly
settling
toward
a
shoreline
a
beach
the
sand
was
a
dazzling
unbelievable
white
such
as
had
never
been
on
his
home
planet
blue
the
sky
and
water
and
green
the
edge
of
the
fantastic
jungle
there
was
a
flash
of
red
in
the
green
as
they
came
still
closer
and
he
realized
suddenly
that
it
must
be
a
the
venusian
parrot
once
so
popular
as
pets
throughout
the
solar
system
throughout
the
system
blood
and
steel
had
fallen
from
the
sky
and
ravished
the
planets
but
now
it
fell
no
more
and
now
this
here
in
this
forgotten
portion
of
an
almost
completely
destroyed
world
it
had
not
fallen
at
all
only
in
some
place
like
this
alone
was
safety
for
him
elsewhere
anywhere
imprisonment
or
more
likely
death
there
was
danger
even
here
three
of
the
crew
of
the
knew
perhaps
someday
one
of
them
would
talk
then
they
would
come
for
him
even
here
but
that
was
a
chance
he
could
not
avoid
nor
were
the
odds
bad
for
three
people
out
of
a
whole
solar
system
knew
where
he
was
and
those
three
were
loyal
fools
the
lifeboat
came
gently
to
rest
the
hatch
swung
open
and
he
stepped
out
and
walked
a
few
paces
up
the
beach
he
turned
and
waited
while
the
two
spacemen
who
had
guided
the
craft
brought
his
chest
out
and
carried
it
across
the
beach
and
to
the
shack
just
at
the
edge
of
the
trees
that
shack
had
once
been
a
relay
station
now
the
equipment
it
had
held
was
long
gone
the
antenna
mast
taken
down
but
the
shack
still
stood
it
would
be
his
home
for
a
while
a
long
while
the
two
men
returned
to
the
lifeboat
preparatory
to
leaving
and
now
the
captain
stood
facing
him
and
the
captain
face
was
a
rigid
mask
it
seemed
with
an
effort
that
the
captain
right
arm
remained
at
his
side
but
that
effort
had
been
ordered
no
salute
the
captain
voice
too
was
rigid
with
unemotion
number
one
silence
and
then
less
bitterly
come
further
from
the
boat
before
you
again
let
your
tongue
run
loose
here
they
had
reached
the
shack
you
are
right
number
no
i
am
no
longer
number
one
you
must
continue
to
think
of
me
as
smith
your
cousin
whom
you
brought
here
for
the
reasons
you
explained
to
the
before
you
surrender
your
ship
if
you
of
me
so
you
will
be
less
likely
to
slip
in
your
speech
there
is
nothing
further
i
can
do
mister
smith
nothing
go
now
and
i
am
ordered
to
surrender
the
there
are
no
orders
the
war
is
over
lost
i
would
suggest
thought
as
to
what
spaceport
you
put
into
in
some
you
may
receive
humane
treatment
in
others
the
captain
nodded
in
others
there
is
great
hatred
yes
that
is
all
that
is
all
and
captain
your
running
of
the
blockade
your
securing
of
fuel
have
constituted
a
deed
of
high
valor
all
i
can
give
you
in
reward
is
my
thanks
but
now
go
goodbye
not
goodbye
the
captain
blurted
impulsively
but
la
the
you
will
permit
me
for
the
last
time
to
address
you
and
salute
the
man
in
the
greatcoat
shrugged
as
you
will
click
of
heels
and
a
salute
that
once
greeted
the
caesars
and
later
the
of
the
century
and
but
yesterday
he
who
was
now
known
as
last
of
the
farewell
number
one
farewell
he
answered
emotionlessly
smith
a
black
dot
on
the
dazzling
white
sand
watched
the
lifeboat
disappear
up
into
the
blue
finally
into
the
haze
of
the
upper
atmosphere
of
venus
that
eternal
haze
that
would
always
be
there
to
mock
his
failure
and
his
bitter
solitude
the
slow
days
snarled
by
and
the
sun
shone
dimly
and
the
screamed
in
the
early
dawn
and
all
day
and
at
sunset
and
sometimes
there
were
the
in
the
trees
that
gibbered
at
him
and
the
rains
came
and
went
away
again
at
nights
there
were
drums
in
the
distance
not
the
martial
roll
of
marching
nor
yet
a
threatening
note
of
savage
hate
just
drums
many
miles
away
throbbing
rhythm
for
native
dances
or
exorcising
perhaps
the
demons
he
assumed
these
venusians
had
their
superstitions
all
other
races
had
there
was
no
threat
for
him
in
that
throbbing
that
was
like
the
beating
of
the
jungle
heart
smith
knew
that
for
although
his
choice
of
destinations
had
been
a
hasty
choice
yet
there
had
been
time
for
him
to
read
the
available
reports
the
natives
were
harmless
and
friendly
a
terran
missionary
had
lived
among
them
some
time
ago
before
the
outbreak
of
the
war
they
were
a
simple
weak
race
they
seldom
went
far
from
their
villages
the
operator
who
had
once
occupied
the
shack
reported
that
he
had
never
seen
one
of
them
so
there
would
be
no
difficulty
in
avoiding
the
natives
nor
danger
if
he
did
encounter
them
nothing
to
worry
about
except
the
bitterness
not
the
bitterness
of
regret
but
of
defeat
defeat
at
the
hands
of
the
defeated
the
damned
martians
who
came
back
after
he
had
driven
them
halfway
across
their
damned
arid
planet
the
jupiter
satellite
confederation
landing
endlessly
on
the
home
planet
sending
their
vast
armadas
of
spacecraft
daily
and
nightly
to
turn
his
mighty
cities
into
dust
in
spite
of
everything
in
spite
of
his
score
of
secret
weapons
and
the
last
desperate
efforts
of
his
weakened
armies
most
of
whose
men
were
under
twenty
or
over
forty
the
treachery
even
in
his
own
army
among
his
own
generals
and
admirals
the
turn
of
luna
that
had
been
the
end
his
people
would
rise
again
but
not
now
after
armageddon
in
his
lifetime
not
under
him
nor
another
like
him
the
last
of
the
dictators
hated
by
a
solar
system
and
hating
it
it
would
have
been
intolerable
save
that
he
was
alone
he
had
foreseen
that
the
need
for
solitude
alone
he
was
still
number
one
the
presence
of
others
would
have
forced
recognition
of
his
miserably
changed
status
alone
his
pride
was
undamaged
his
ego
was
intact
the
long
days
and
the
screams
the
slithering
swish
of
the
surf
the
movements
of
the
in
the
trees
and
the
raucousness
of
their
shrill
voices
drums
those
sounds
and
those
alone
but
perhaps
silence
would
have
been
worse
for
the
times
of
silence
were
louder
times
he
would
pace
the
beach
at
night
and
overhead
would
be
the
roar
of
jets
and
rockets
the
ships
that
had
roared
over
new
albuquerque
his
capitol
in
those
last
days
before
he
had
fled
the
crump
of
bombs
and
the
screams
and
the
blood
and
the
flat
voices
of
his
folding
generals
those
were
the
days
when
the
waves
of
hatred
from
the
conquered
peoples
beat
upon
his
country
as
the
waves
of
a
stormy
sea
beat
upon
crumbling
cliffs
leagues
back
of
the
battered
lines
you
could
that
hate
and
vengeance
as
a
tangible
thing
a
thing
that
thickened
the
air
that
made
breathing
difficult
and
talking
futile
and
the
spacecraft
the
jets
the
rockets
the
damnable
rockets
more
every
day
and
every
night
and
ten
coming
for
every
one
shot
down
rocket
ships
raining
hell
from
the
sky
havoc
and
chaos
and
the
end
of
hope
and
then
he
knew
that
he
had
been
hearing
another
sound
hearing
it
often
and
long
at
a
time
it
was
a
voice
that
shouted
invective
and
ranted
hatred
and
glorified
the
steel
might
of
his
planet
and
the
destiny
of
a
man
and
a
people
it
was
his
own
voice
and
it
beat
back
the
waves
from
the
white
shore
it
stopped
their
wet
encroachment
upon
this
his
domain
it
screamed
back
at
the
and
they
were
silent
and
at
times
he
laughed
and
the
laughed
sometimes
the
queerly
shaped
venusian
trees
talked
too
but
their
voices
were
quieter
the
trees
were
submissive
they
were
good
subjects
sometimes
fantastic
thoughts
went
through
his
head
the
race
of
trees
the
pure
race
of
trees
that
never
interbred
that
stood
firm
always
someday
the
trees
but
that
was
just
a
dream
a
fancy
more
real
were
the
and
the
they
were
the
ones
who
persecuted
him
there
was
the
who
would
shriek
is
lost
he
had
shot
at
it
a
hundred
times
with
his
needle
gun
but
always
it
flew
away
unharmed
sometimes
it
did
not
even
fly
away
is
lost
at
last
he
wasted
no
more
needle
darts
he
stalked
it
to
strangle
it
with
his
bare
hands
that
was
better
on
what
might
have
been
the
thousandth
try
he
caught
it
and
killed
it
and
there
was
warm
blood
on
his
hands
and
feathers
were
flying
that
should
have
ended
it
but
it
did
now
there
were
a
dozen
that
screamed
that
all
was
lost
perhaps
there
had
been
a
dozen
all
along
now
he
merely
shook
his
fist
at
them
or
threw
stones
the
the
venusian
equivalent
of
the
terran
ant
stole
his
food
but
that
did
not
matter
there
was
plenty
of
food
there
had
been
a
cache
of
it
in
the
shack
meant
to
restock
a
and
never
used
the
would
not
get
at
it
until
he
opened
a
can
but
then
unless
he
ate
it
all
at
once
they
ate
whatever
he
left
that
did
not
matter
there
were
plenty
of
cans
and
always
fresh
fruit
from
the
jungle
always
in
season
for
there
were
no
seasons
here
except
the
rains
but
the
served
a
purpose
for
him
they
kept
him
sane
by
giving
him
something
tangible
something
inferior
to
hate
oh
it
was
hatred
at
first
mere
annoyance
he
killed
them
in
a
routine
sort
of
way
at
first
but
they
kept
coming
back
always
there
were
in
his
larder
wherever
he
did
it
in
his
bed
he
sat
the
legs
of
the
cot
in
dishes
of
gasoline
but
the
still
got
in
perhaps
they
dropped
from
the
ceiling
although
he
never
caught
them
doing
it
they
bothered
his
sleep
he
feel
them
running
over
him
even
when
spent
an
hour
picking
the
bed
clean
of
them
by
the
light
of
the
carbide
lantern
they
scurried
with
tickling
little
feet
and
he
could
not
sleep
he
grew
to
hate
them
and
the
very
misery
of
his
nights
made
his
days
more
tolerable
by
giving
them
an
increasing
purpose
a
pogrom
against
the
he
sought
out
their
holes
by
patiently
following
one
bearing
a
bit
of
food
and
he
poured
gasoline
into
the
hole
and
the
earth
around
it
taking
satisfaction
in
the
thought
of
the
writhings
in
agony
below
he
went
about
hunting
to
step
on
them
to
stamp
them
out
he
must
have
killed
millions
of
but
always
there
were
as
many
left
never
did
their
number
seem
to
diminish
in
the
slightest
like
the
martians
but
unlike
the
martians
they
did
not
fight
back
theirs
was
the
passive
resistance
of
a
vast
productivity
that
bred
ceaselessly
overwhelmingly
billions
to
replace
millions
individual
could
be
killed
and
he
took
savage
satisfaction
in
their
killing
but
he
knew
his
methods
were
useless
save
for
the
pleasure
and
the
purpose
they
gave
him
sometimes
the
pleasure
would
pall
in
the
shadow
of
its
futility
and
he
would
dream
of
mechanized
means
of
killing
them
he
read
carefully
what
little
material
there
was
in
his
tiny
library
about
the
they
were
astonishingly
like
the
ants
of
terra
so
much
that
there
had
been
speculation
about
their
relationship
that
interest
him
how
could
they
be
killed
once
a
year
for
a
brief
period
they
took
on
the
characteristics
of
the
army
ants
of
terra
they
came
from
their
holes
in
endless
numbers
and
swept
everything
before
them
in
their
devouring
march
he
wet
his
lips
when
he
read
that
perhaps
the
opportunity
would
come
then
to
destroy
to
destroy
almost
smith
forgot
people
and
the
solar
system
and
what
had
been
here
in
this
new
world
there
was
only
he
and
the
the
and
the
did
count
they
had
no
order
and
no
system
the
in
the
intensity
of
his
hatred
there
slowly
filtered
through
a
grudging
admiration
the
were
true
totalitarians
they
practiced
what
he
had
preached
to
a
mightier
race
practiced
it
with
a
thoroughness
beyond
the
kind
of
man
to
comprehend
theirs
the
complete
submergence
of
the
individual
to
the
state
theirs
the
complete
ruthlessness
of
the
true
conqueror
the
perfect
selfless
bravery
of
the
true
soldier
but
they
got
into
his
bed
into
his
clothes
into
his
food
they
crawled
with
intolerable
tickling
feet
nights
he
walked
the
beach
and
that
night
was
one
of
the
noisy
nights
there
were
up
there
in
the
moonlight
sky
and
their
shadows
dappled
the
black
water
of
the
sea
the
planes
the
rockets
the
they
were
what
had
ravaged
his
cities
had
turned
his
railroads
into
twisted
steel
had
dropped
their
on
his
most
vital
factories
he
shook
his
fist
at
them
and
shrieked
imprecations
at
the
sky
and
when
he
had
ceased
shouting
there
were
voices
on
the
beach
conrad
voice
in
his
ear
as
it
had
sounded
that
day
when
conrad
had
walked
into
the
palace
and
forgotten
the
salute
there
is
a
breakthrough
at
denver
number
one
toronto
and
monterey
are
in
danger
and
in
the
other
hemispheres
his
voice
the
damned
martians
and
the
traitors
from
luna
are
driving
over
the
argentine
others
have
landed
near
new
petrograd
it
is
a
rout
all
is
lost
voices
crying
number
one
number
one
a
sea
of
hysterical
voices
number
one
number
one
a
voice
that
was
louder
higher
more
frenetic
than
any
of
the
others
his
memory
of
his
own
voice
calculated
but
inspired
as
he
heard
it
on
of
his
own
speeches
the
voices
of
children
chanting
to
thee
o
number
one
he
remember
the
rest
of
the
words
but
they
had
been
beautiful
words
that
had
been
at
the
public
school
meet
in
the
new
los
angeles
how
strange
that
he
should
remember
here
and
now
the
very
tone
of
his
voice
and
inflection
the
shining
wonder
in
their
children
eyes
children
only
but
they
were
willing
to
kill
and
die
convinced
that
all
that
was
needed
to
cure
the
ills
of
the
race
was
a
suitable
leader
to
follow
is
lost
and
suddenly
the
monster
were
swooping
downward
and
starkly
he
realized
what
a
clear
target
he
presented
here
against
the
white
moonlit
beach
they
must
see
him
the
crescendo
of
motors
as
he
ran
sobbing
now
in
fear
for
the
cover
of
the
jungle
into
the
screening
shadow
of
the
giant
trees
and
the
sheltering
blackness
he
stumbled
and
fell
was
up
and
running
again
and
now
his
eyes
could
see
in
the
dimmer
moonlight
that
filtered
through
the
branches
overhead
stirrings
there
in
the
branches
stirrings
and
voices
in
the
night
voices
in
and
of
the
night
whispers
and
shrieks
of
pain
yes
shown
them
pain
and
now
their
tortured
voices
ran
with
him
through
the
grass
among
the
trees
the
night
was
hideous
with
noise
red
noises
an
almost
din
that
he
could
nearly
as
well
as
he
could
see
and
hear
it
and
after
a
while
his
breath
came
raspingly
and
there
was
a
thumping
sound
that
was
the
beating
of
his
heart
and
the
beating
of
the
night
and
then
he
could
run
no
longer
and
he
clutched
a
tree
to
keep
from
falling
his
arms
trembling
about
it
and
his
face
pressed
against
the
impersonal
roughness
of
the
bark
there
was
no
wind
but
the
tree
swayed
back
and
forth
and
his
body
with
it
then
as
abruptly
as
light
goes
on
when
a
switch
is
thrown
the
noise
vanished
utter
silence
and
at
last
he
was
strong
enough
to
let
go
his
grip
on
the
tree
and
stand
erect
again
to
look
about
to
get
his
bearings
one
tree
was
like
another
and
for
a
moment
he
thought
he
have
to
stay
here
until
daylight
then
he
remembered
that
the
sound
of
the
surf
would
give
him
his
directions
he
listened
hard
and
heard
it
faint
and
far
away
and
another
sound
one
that
he
had
never
heard
before
faint
also
but
seeming
to
come
from
his
right
and
quite
near
he
looked
that
way
and
there
was
a
patch
of
opening
in
the
trees
above
the
grass
was
waving
strangely
in
that
area
of
moonlight
it
moved
although
there
was
no
breeze
to
move
it
and
there
was
an
almost
sudden
beyond
which
the
blades
thinned
out
quickly
to
barrenness
and
the
sound
it
was
like
the
sound
of
the
surf
but
it
was
continuous
it
was
more
like
the
rustle
of
dry
leaves
but
there
were
no
dry
leaves
to
rustle
smith
took
a
step
toward
the
sound
and
looked
down
more
grass
bent
and
fell
and
vanished
even
as
he
looked
beyond
the
moving
edge
of
devastation
was
a
brown
floor
of
the
moving
bodies
of
row
after
row
orderly
rank
after
orderly
rank
marching
resistlessly
onward
billions
of
an
army
of
eating
their
way
across
the
night
fascinated
he
stared
down
at
them
there
was
no
danger
for
their
progress
was
slow
he
retreated
a
step
to
keep
beyond
their
front
rank
the
sound
then
was
the
sound
of
chewing
he
could
see
one
edge
of
the
column
and
it
was
a
neat
orderly
edge
and
there
was
discipline
for
the
ones
on
the
outside
were
larger
than
those
in
the
center
he
retreated
another
step
and
then
quite
suddenly
his
body
was
afire
in
several
spreading
places
the
vanguard
ahead
of
the
rank
that
ate
away
the
grass
his
boots
were
brown
with
screaming
with
pain
he
whirled
about
and
ran
beating
with
his
hands
at
the
burning
spots
on
his
body
he
ran
into
a
tree
bruising
his
face
horribly
and
the
night
was
scarlet
with
pain
and
shooting
fire
but
he
staggered
on
almost
blindly
running
writhing
tearing
off
his
clothes
as
he
ran
this
then
was
there
was
a
shrill
screaming
in
his
ears
that
must
have
been
the
sound
of
his
own
voice
when
he
could
no
longer
run
he
crawled
naked
now
and
with
only
a
few
still
clinging
to
him
and
the
blind
tangent
of
his
flight
had
taken
him
well
out
of
the
path
of
the
advancing
army
but
stark
fear
and
the
memory
of
unendurable
pain
drove
him
on
his
knees
raw
now
he
could
no
longer
crawl
but
he
got
himself
erect
again
on
trembling
legs
and
staggered
on
catching
hold
of
a
tree
and
pushing
himself
away
from
it
to
catch
the
next
falling
rising
falling
again
his
throat
raw
from
the
screaming
invective
of
his
hate
bushes
and
the
rough
bark
of
trees
tore
his
flesh
into
the
village
compound
just
before
dawn
staggered
a
man
a
naked
terrestrial
he
looked
about
with
dull
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
nothing
and
understand
nothing
the
females
and
young
ran
before
him
even
the
males
retreated
he
stood
there
swaying
and
the
incredulous
eyes
of
the
natives
widened
as
they
saw
the
condition
of
his
body
and
the
blankness
of
his
eyes
when
he
made
no
hostile
move
they
came
closer
again
formed
a
wondering
chattering
circle
about
him
these
venusian
humanoids
some
ran
to
bring
the
chief
and
the
chief
son
who
knew
everything
the
mad
naked
human
opened
his
lips
as
though
he
were
going
to
speak
but
instead
he
fell
he
fell
as
a
dead
man
falls
but
when
they
turned
him
over
in
the
dust
they
saw
that
his
chest
still
rose
and
fell
in
labored
breathing
and
then
came
alwa
the
aged
chieftain
and
nrana
his
son
alwa
gave
quick
excited
orders
two
of
the
men
carried
smith
into
the
hut
and
the
wives
of
the
chief
and
the
chief
son
took
over
the
earthling
care
and
rubbed
him
with
a
soothing
and
healing
salve
but
for
days
and
nights
he
lay
without
moving
and
without
speaking
or
opening
his
eyes
and
they
did
not
know
whether
he
would
live
or
die
then
at
last
he
opened
his
eyes
and
he
talked
although
they
could
make
out
nothing
of
the
things
he
said
nrana
came
and
listened
for
nrana
of
all
of
them
spoke
and
understood
best
the
earthling
language
for
he
had
been
the
special
protege
of
the
terran
missionary
who
had
lived
with
them
for
a
while
nrana
listened
but
he
shook
his
head
the
words
he
said
the
words
are
of
the
terran
tongue
but
i
make
nothing
of
them
his
mind
is
not
well
the
aged
alwa
said
aie
stay
beside
him
perhaps
as
his
body
heals
his
words
will
be
beautiful
words
as
were
the
words
of
the
who
in
the
terran
tongue
taught
us
of
the
gods
and
their
good
so
they
cared
for
him
well
and
his
wounds
healed
and
the
day
came
when
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
handsome
face
of
nrana
sitting
there
beside
him
and
nrana
said
softly
good
day
man
of
earth
you
feel
better
no
there
was
no
answer
and
the
eyes
of
the
man
on
the
sleeping
mat
stared
glared
at
him
nrana
could
see
that
those
eyes
were
not
yet
sane
but
he
saw
too
that
the
madness
in
them
was
not
the
same
that
it
had
been
nrana
did
not
know
the
words
for
delirium
and
paranoia
but
he
could
distinguish
between
them
no
longer
was
the
earthling
a
raving
maniac
and
nrana
made
a
very
common
error
an
error
more
civilized
beings
than
he
have
often
made
he
thought
the
paranoia
was
an
improvement
over
the
wider
madness
he
talked
on
hoping
the
earthling
would
talk
too
and
he
did
not
recognize
the
danger
of
his
silence
we
welcome
you
earthling
he
said
and
hope
that
you
will
live
among
us
as
did
the
gerhardt
he
taught
us
to
worship
the
true
gods
of
the
high
heavens
jehovah
and
jesus
and
their
prophets
the
men
from
the
skies
he
taught
us
to
pray
and
to
love
our
enemies
and
nrana
shook
his
head
sadly
but
many
of
our
tribe
have
gone
back
to
the
older
gods
the
cruel
gods
they
say
there
has
been
great
strife
among
the
outsiders
and
no
more
remain
upon
all
of
venus
my
father
alwa
and
i
are
glad
another
one
has
come
you
will
be
able
to
help
those
of
us
who
have
gone
back
you
can
teach
us
love
and
kindliness
the
eyes
of
the
dictator
closed
nrana
did
not
know
whether
or
not
he
slept
but
nrana
stood
up
quietly
to
leave
the
hut
in
the
doorway
he
turned
and
said
we
pray
for
you
and
then
joyously
he
ran
out
of
the
village
to
seek
the
others
who
were
gathering
for
the
feast
of
the
fourth
event
when
with
several
of
them
he
returned
to
the
village
the
earthling
was
gone
the
hut
was
empty
outside
the
compound
they
found
at
last
the
trail
of
his
passing
they
followed
and
it
led
to
a
stream
and
along
the
stream
until
they
came
to
the
tabu
of
the
green
pool
and
could
go
no
farther
he
went
downstream
said
alwa
gravely
he
sought
the
sea
and
the
beach
he
was
well
then
in
his
mind
for
he
knew
that
all
streams
go
to
the
sea
perhaps
he
had
a
there
at
the
beach
nrana
said
worriedly
all
earthlings
come
from
the
sky
the
told
us
that
perhaps
he
will
come
back
to
us
said
alwa
his
old
eyes
misted
smith
was
coming
back
all
right
and
sooner
than
they
had
dared
to
hope
as
soon
in
fact
as
he
could
make
the
trip
to
the
shack
and
return
he
came
back
dressed
in
clothing
very
different
from
the
garb
the
other
white
man
had
worn
shining
leather
boots
and
the
uniform
of
the
galactic
guard
and
a
wide
leather
belt
with
a
holster
for
his
needle
gun
but
the
gun
was
in
his
hand
when
at
dusk
he
strode
into
the
compound
he
said
i
am
number
one
the
lord
of
all
the
solar
system
and
your
ruler
who
was
chief
among
you
alwa
had
been
in
his
hut
but
he
heard
the
words
and
came
out
he
understood
the
words
but
not
their
meaning
he
said
earthling
we
welcome
you
back
i
am
the
chief
you
were
the
chief
now
you
will
serve
me
i
am
the
chief
alwa
old
eyes
were
bewildered
at
the
strangeness
of
this
he
said
i
will
serve
you
yes
all
of
us
but
it
is
not
fitting
that
an
earthling
should
be
chief
among
the
whisper
of
the
needle
gun
alwa
wrinkled
hands
went
to
his
scrawny
neck
where
just
off
the
center
was
a
sudden
tiny
pin
prick
of
a
hole
a
faint
trickle
of
red
coursed
over
the
dark
blue
of
his
skin
the
old
man
knees
gave
way
under
him
as
the
rage
of
the
poisoned
needle
dart
struck
him
and
he
fell
others
started
toward
him
back
said
smith
let
him
die
slowly
that
you
may
all
see
what
happens
to
but
one
of
the
chief
wives
one
who
did
not
understand
the
speech
of
earth
was
already
lifting
alwa
head
the
needle
gun
whispered
again
and
she
fell
forward
across
him
i
am
number
one
said
smith
and
lord
of
all
the
planets
all
who
oppose
me
die
by
and
then
suddenly
all
of
them
were
running
toward
him
his
finger
pressed
the
trigger
and
four
of
them
died
before
the
avalanche
of
their
bodies
bore
him
down
and
overwhelmed
him
nrana
had
been
first
in
that
rush
and
nrana
died
the
others
tied
the
earthling
up
and
threw
him
into
one
of
the
huts
and
then
while
the
women
began
wailing
for
the
dead
the
men
made
council
they
elected
kallana
chief
and
he
stood
before
them
and
said
the
the
mister
gerhardt
deceived
us
there
was
fear
and
worry
in
his
voice
and
apprehension
on
his
blue
face
if
this
be
indeed
the
lord
of
whom
he
told
us
he
is
not
a
god
said
another
he
is
an
earthling
but
there
have
been
such
before
on
venus
many
many
of
them
who
came
long
and
long
ago
from
the
skies
now
they
are
all
dead
killed
in
strife
among
themselves
it
is
well
this
last
one
is
one
of
them
but
he
is
mad
and
they
talked
long
and
the
dusk
grew
into
night
while
they
talked
of
what
they
must
do
the
gleam
of
firelight
upon
their
bodies
and
the
waiting
drummer
the
problem
was
difficult
to
harm
one
who
was
mad
was
tabu
if
he
was
really
a
god
it
would
be
worse
thunder
and
lightning
from
the
sky
would
destroy
the
village
yet
they
dared
not
release
him
even
if
they
took
the
evil
and
buried
it
he
might
find
other
ways
to
harm
them
he
might
have
another
where
he
had
gone
for
the
first
yes
it
was
a
difficult
problem
for
them
but
the
eldest
and
wisest
of
them
one
gave
them
at
last
the
answer
o
kallana
he
said
let
us
give
him
to
the
if
harm
him
and
old
grinned
a
toothless
mirthless
grin
it
would
be
their
doing
and
not
ours
kallana
shuddered
it
is
the
most
horrible
of
all
deaths
and
if
he
is
a
god
if
he
is
a
god
they
will
not
harm
him
if
he
is
mad
and
not
a
god
we
will
not
have
harmed
him
it
harms
not
a
man
to
tie
him
to
a
tree
kallana
considered
well
for
the
safety
of
his
people
was
at
stake
considering
he
remembered
how
alwa
and
nrana
had
died
he
said
it
is
right
the
waiting
drummer
began
the
rhythm
of
the
and
those
of
the
men
who
were
young
and
fleet
lighted
torches
in
the
fire
and
went
out
into
the
forest
to
seek
the
who
were
still
in
their
season
of
marching
and
after
a
while
having
found
what
they
sought
they
returned
they
took
the
earthling
out
with
them
then
and
tied
him
to
a
tree
they
left
him
there
and
they
left
the
gag
over
his
lips
because
they
did
not
wish
to
hear
his
screams
when
the
came
the
cloth
of
the
gag
would
be
eaten
too
but
by
that
time
there
would
be
no
flesh
under
it
from
which
a
scream
might
come
they
left
him
and
went
back
to
the
compound
and
the
drums
took
up
the
rhythm
of
propitiation
to
the
gods
for
what
they
had
done
for
they
had
they
knew
cut
very
close
to
the
corner
of
a
tabu
but
the
provocation
had
been
great
and
they
hoped
they
would
not
be
punished
all
night
the
drums
would
throb
the
man
tied
to
the
tree
struggled
with
his
bonds
but
they
were
strong
and
his
writhings
made
the
knots
but
tighten
his
eyes
became
accustomed
to
the
darkness
he
tried
to
shout
i
am
number
one
lord
of
and
then
because
he
could
not
shout
and
because
he
could
not
loosen
himself
there
came
a
rift
in
his
madness
he
remembered
who
he
was
and
all
the
old
hatreds
and
bitterness
welled
up
in
him
he
remembered
too
what
had
happened
in
the
compound
and
wondered
why
the
venusian
natives
had
not
killed
him
why
instead
they
had
tied
him
here
alone
in
the
darkness
of
the
jungle
afar
he
heard
the
throbbing
of
the
drums
and
they
were
like
the
beating
of
the
heart
of
night
and
there
was
a
louder
nearer
sound
that
was
the
pulse
of
blood
in
his
ears
as
the
fear
came
to
him
the
fear
that
he
knew
why
they
had
tied
him
here
the
horrible
gibbering
fear
that
for
the
last
time
an
army
marched
against
him
he
had
time
to
savor
that
fear
to
the
uttermost
to
have
it
become
a
creeping
certainty
that
crawled
into
the
black
corners
of
his
soul
as
would
the
soldiers
of
the
coming
army
crawl
into
his
ears
and
nostrils
while
others
would
eat
away
his
eyelids
to
get
at
the
eyes
behind
them
and
then
and
only
then
did
he
hear
the
sound
that
was
like
the
rustle
of
dry
leaves
in
a
dank
black
jungle
where
there
were
no
dry
leaves
to
rustle
nor
breeze
to
rustle
them
horribly
number
one
the
last
of
the
dictators
did
not
go
mad
again
not
exactly
but
he
laughed
and
laughed
and
laughed
