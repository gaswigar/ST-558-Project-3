one
chapter
i
the
two
ships
pursuer
and
pursued
quaintly
shaped
with
heavy
flapping
sails
lay
apparently
becalmed
in
a
sort
of
natural
basin
formed
by
the
junction
of
two
silently
flowing
turgid
rivers
rivers
whose
water
was
thick
and
oily
yellow
in
colour
unpleasant
to
look
at
the
country
through
which
they
passed
was
and
desolate
though
in
the
far
distance
were
rice
fields
and
the
curiously
fashioned
roofs
of
a
chinese
village
the
sun
beat
down
upon
the
glasslike
water
the
air
was
windless
further
movement
seemed
impossible
until
from
the
smaller
boat
through
unexpectedly
opened
hatches
half
a
dozen
oars
were
suddenly
thrust
into
the
water
the
huge
chinaman
who
stood
at
the
helm
and
naked
to
the
waist
picked
up
an
enormous
pole
and
let
it
gradually
down
into
the
river
bed
the
oars
languidly
though
they
were
wielded
cut
the
water
and
the
dhow
began
slowly
to
move
wu
abst
the
mighty
terror
of
the
great
river
as
he
loved
to
hear
himself
described
grinned
mockingly
as
he
looked
backwards
towards
his
pursuer
he
shouted
words
through
the
glistening
heat
intended
to
convey
his
contempt
of
those
who
fancied
that
he
was
to
be
caught
napping
then
he
bent
over
his
giant
pole
and
glanced
with
satisfaction
at
the
distant
bank
which
already
showed
signs
of
their
progress
at
the
bend
of
the
river
not
three
miles
distant
was
a
stretch
of
water
into
which
no
such
craft
as
that
which
had
chased
him
could
follow
he
relit
his
pipe
therefore
and
smoked
like
a
man
at
peace
whilst
below
the
sweat
rolled
from
the
naked
bodies
of
the
men
who
were
emulating
their
roman
predecessors
of
two
thousand
years
ago
wu
abst
pleased
with
their
efforts
shipped
his
pole
for
a
moment
and
leaning
over
the
side
shouted
encouragement
and
exhortation
to
the
toilers
then
suddenly
the
words
died
away
upon
his
lips
his
whole
frame
stiffened
the
remains
of
the
grin
faded
from
his
face
the
whole
expression
of
which
was
now
almost
ludicrously
changed
for
across
that
little
stretch
of
river
came
the
horrible
sound
of
which
he
had
heard
the
denoting
the
use
of
some
mechanical
contrivance
which
triumphed
over
windless
airs
and
opposing
currents
his
horrified
gaze
became
fastened
upon
the
pursuing
ship
now
also
moving
and
not
only
moving
but
moving
very
much
faster
than
anything
which
all
the
efforts
of
his
toiling
gang
were
able
to
accomplish
bewilderment
gave
place
to
anger
which
in
its
turn
became
merged
almost
at
once
in
the
philosophy
of
his
race
the
graveyard
of
all
emotions
he
shouted
an
order
to
those
down
below
there
was
a
clatter
and
a
rumble
as
the
men
shipped
their
oars
and
another
more
metallic
sound
as
they
exchanged
them
for
other
weapons
wu
abst
thrust
his
hand
through
the
window
of
a
small
cuddy
hole
which
he
called
his
cabin
and
drew
out
a
long
antiquated
rifle
it
was
one
of
a
type
manufactured
in
birmingham
fifty
years
ago
rejected
since
then
by
every
south
american
band
of
patriots
planning
a
revolution
and
scoffed
at
even
by
west
african
savages
he
nevertheless
dropped
a
cartridge
into
its
place
and
waited
whilst
the
other
ship
glided
almost
alongside
his
eyes
swept
its
deck
and
his
bloodthirsty
intentions
were
promptly
changed
with
expressionless
face
he
slipped
his
weapon
back
again
through
the
cuddy
hole
and
called
down
another
order
below
then
he
leaned
over
the
rail
and
raised
his
hand
in
salute
a
man
who
was
seated
aft
in
a
basket
chair
upon
the
deck
of
the
approaching
ship
rose
to
his
feet
and
came
to
the
side
he
wore
chinese
garb
and
he
spoke
in
chinese
but
his
linen
clothes
were
spotlessly
white
and
he
wore
no
pigtail
are
you
wu
abst
the
river
pirate
he
called
out
i
am
wu
abst
was
the
reply
and
who
are
you
i
am
wu
ling
the
peaceful
trader
the
other
answered
i
bring
prosperity
to
those
whom
you
seek
to
rob
wu
abst
spat
into
the
river
i
know
of
you
he
growled
you
trade
with
foreign
money
you
take
the
jade
and
the
gems
the
silk
and
the
handiwork
of
these
people
and
sell
them
rubbish
where
i
take
the
other
rejoined
i
give
something
in
return
which
is
more
than
you
do
what
is
your
business
with
me
wu
abst
demanded
glancing
sullenly
at
the
two
maxim
guns
trained
upon
him
behind
each
of
which
was
seated
a
brawny
and
chinese
sailor
last
night
wu
ling
announced
i
traded
at
the
village
of
hyest
and
i
heard
a
strange
tale
i
heard
that
you
had
on
board
your
ship
a
foreigner
tied
with
ropes
and
that
you
were
waiting
to
reach
your
own
stretches
to
throw
him
to
the
crocodiles
is
this
the
truth
wu
abst
or
am
i
to
search
your
ship
it
is
the
truth
the
other
admitted
grimly
he
is
a
foreign
devil
who
merits
death
and
even
torture
he
is
a
thief
and
a
sacrilegious
pest
upon
the
earth
you
speak
hard
words
of
him
wu
ling
observed
what
words
other
than
hard
can
be
spoken
of
such
wu
abst
retorted
presently
i
shall
tell
you
of
his
deeds
i
like
not
your
speech
wu
ling
you
speak
our
tongue
but
speak
it
strangely
there
are
rumours
of
you
in
many
places
there
are
some
who
say
that
not
only
is
the
money
with
which
you
trade
the
money
of
foreign
devils
but
that
you
too
are
one
of
them
in
spirit
if
not
by
birth
what
i
am
is
none
of
the
present
business
wu
ling
declared
what
of
this
prisoner
of
yours
i
shall
speak
of
him
now
wu
abst
answered
then
if
you
are
indeed
a
man
of
this
country
you
shall
see
that
i
do
no
evil
thing
in
casting
him
to
the
crocodiles
he
was
caught
a
thief
in
the
sacred
temple
of
the
sacred
village
of
nilkaya
in
the
temple
where
the
great
emperor
himself
was
used
to
worship
the
priests
who
caught
him
tied
his
body
with
ropes
not
i
they
brought
him
to
the
riverside
and
they
gave
me
silver
to
deal
with
him
your
story
is
true
wu
ling
admitted
the
circumstances
you
relate
are
known
to
me
but
there
were
two
of
these
robbers
what
of
the
other
his
companion
the
priests
say
that
he
escaped
and
with
him
the
two
sacred
images
of
the
great
god
reverenced
for
nine
hundred
years
the
pirate
confided
it
is
because
of
the
escape
of
the
other
that
they
wish
to
make
sure
of
the
death
of
this
one
wu
ling
considered
for
a
moment
wu
abst
he
pronounced
at
last
you
have
told
me
a
true
story
and
you
have
acted
in
this
matter
as
a
just
man
therefore
these
guns
of
mine
shall
bring
no
message
of
evil
to
you
nor
shall
i
declare
war
so
long
as
you
keep
to
your
side
of
the
river
and
above
the
villages
where
i
trade
but
as
for
the
foreign
devil
you
must
hand
him
over
to
me
wu
abst
raised
his
hands
to
heaven
for
a
time
his
speech
was
almost
incomprehensible
he
was
stricken
with
a
fit
of
anger
he
shouted
and
pleaded
until
he
foamed
at
the
mouth
wu
ling
listened
unmoved
when
at
last
there
was
silence
he
spoke
it
is
clear
to
me
what
you
intended
wu
abst
he
said
there
was
to
be
torture
and
more
silver
from
the
priests
before
you
cast
this
prisoner
to
the
sea
fish
it
is
a
hard
living
that
one
makes
nowadays
wu
abst
the
terror
of
the
river
muttered
nevertheless
in
this
matter
i
am
firm
the
other
insisted
hand
me
over
the
foreigner
and
go
your
way
you
know
of
me
i
travel
into
dangerous
places
when
i
leave
my
ship
and
i
have
a
score
of
men
below
who
could
hew
their
way
through
a
regiment
of
your
cutthroats
and
a
gun
in
the
bows
there
which
would
send
you
to
the
bottom
with
a
single
discharge
i
am
your
master
wu
abst
and
i
command
bring
me
the
foreigner
and
go
your
way
so
a
few
minutes
later
a
barely
conscious
young
englishman
the
remains
of
his
garments
rags
upon
his
back
blue
in
the
face
from
lack
of
circulation
a
hideous
and
pitiful
sight
was
carried
up
from
the
hold
of
wu
abst
sailing
dhow
and
laid
upon
the
deck
of
the
trading
schooner
of
wu
ling
his
cords
were
cut
brandy
and
water
were
poured
down
his
throat
a
sail
reared
as
a
shelter
from
the
sun
whilst
from
a
small
hose
cool
refreshing
water
was
sprayed
over
him
until
consciousness
returned
and
speech
began
to
stammer
from
his
lips
then
from
the
petrol
engine
commenced
once
more
the
noise
which
had
brought
consternation
to
wu
abst
the
ship
swung
round
in
a
circle
and
passed
on
its
way
down
the
river
wu
abst
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
relit
his
pipe
perhaps
after
all
there
would
have
been
no
more
silver
that
evening
seemed
to
the
released
man
like
a
foretaste
of
paradise
he
lay
on
a
couch
in
wu
ling
cabin
with
the
roof
and
sides
rolled
back
and
nothing
but
a
cunning
arrangement
of
mosquito
netting
between
him
and
the
violet
twilight
above
was
the
moon
and
the
brilliantly
starlit
night
on
either
side
occasional
groves
of
trees
trees
growing
almost
down
to
the
river
edge
some
with
poisonous
odours
others
almost
sickly
sweet
sometimes
there
was
a
light
from
a
distant
village
but
more
often
they
were
enveloped
in
a
thick
velvety
darkness
and
they
were
pointing
for
the
great
port
at
the
mouth
of
the
river
and
safety
the
released
man
was
sipping
brandy
and
water
and
smoking
his
host
sat
opposite
him
grave
and
enigmatic
i
talk
english
little
wu
ling
said
but
i
understand
all
speak
your
story
and
tell
how
called
the
young
man
raised
himself
slightly
my
name
is
gregory
ballaston
he
announced
i
am
an
englishman
as
you
know
a
traveller
and
fond
of
adventure
for
years
this
story
of
the
temple
of
nilkaya
has
been
in
my
brain
i
heard
all
about
it
from
some
one
who
lived
in
pekin
for
many
years
the
story
wu
ling
enquired
politely
in
this
temple
the
young
man
narrated
is
a
great
statue
of
a
chinese
god
buddha
i
suppose
and
on
either
side
of
it
are
two
smaller
ones
made
from
hard
wood
marvellously
carved
and
some
say
a
thousand
years
old
each
is
supposed
to
be
a
counterpart
of
the
greater
god
and
yet
they
demonstrate
an
amazingly
presented
allegory
they
bear
a
likeness
to
one
another
they
bear
a
likeness
to
the
god
himself
but
each
is
curiously
different
in
one
you
seem
to
trace
the
whole
of
the
evil
qualities
which
could
ever
enter
into
the
character
of
man
and
in
the
other
all
the
good
qualities
one
is
hideous
and
the
other
beautiful
yet
if
you
put
them
side
by
side
and
glance
quickly
from
one
to
the
other
the
two
seem
to
grow
together
so
that
the
impression
of
the
image
which
is
left
in
your
mind
is
that
of
the
great
god
above
they
are
called
the
body
and
the
soul
this
story
i
have
heard
wu
ling
admitted
i
have
heard
it
many
times
but
i
scarcely
believed
it
until
i
saw
the
young
man
continued
i
had
only
a
few
minutes
in
the
temple
and
there
was
danger
all
around
yet
for
a
moment
they
took
my
breath
away
i
could
scarcely
move
why
the
man
who
fashioned
them
might
have
been
an
oriental
phidias
proceed
wu
ling
begged
well
the
point
of
the
story
is
this
generations
ago
there
was
a
great
rising
amongst
the
people
an
invasion
from
the
north
and
robbers
seem
to
have
overrun
the
whole
place
they
sacked
even
the
temples
and
the
priests
those
who
had
warning
of
their
coming
stripped
their
robes
and
their
temples
of
all
the
precious
stones
which
they
possessed
and
hid
them
hid
them
wu
ling
repeated
ah
some
of
this
story
you
have
of
course
heard
the
young
man
went
on
because
your
trade
brings
you
i
suppose
within
a
hundred
miles
of
nilkaya
the
temples
were
rich
in
jewels
the
emperors
of
china
had
sent
them
gifts
for
centuries
and
the
legend
is
that
all
the
most
valuable
were
concealed
within
these
two
images
the
body
and
the
soul
that
wu
ling
commented
is
a
strange
story
as
i
told
you
the
young
man
continued
i
heard
it
from
one
who
lived
in
pekin
and
i
believe
that
it
is
the
truth
for
centuries
the
priests
have
possessed
a
manuscript
which
has
been
handed
down
from
one
high
priest
to
the
other
and
this
manuscript
tells
how
these
images
have
been
fashioned
so
that
there
is
within
them
a
hollow
place
there
are
directions
for
finding
it
and
for
opening
the
images
and
they
say
that
without
these
directions
no
man
in
the
world
could
guess
how
to
do
it
i
have
spoken
with
one
who
has
visited
the
temple
and
who
was
not
quite
so
much
pressed
for
time
as
i
was
who
has
seen
these
images
only
a
few
feet
away
and
who
insists
upon
it
that
there
is
not
a
sign
of
any
possible
aperture
or
any
break
in
the
wood
a
simple
thing
wu
ling
suggested
blandly
would
be
to
break
with
choppers
the
young
man
raised
his
eyebrows
it
is
strange
to
hear
you
a
chinaman
propose
such
a
thing
he
remarked
i
suppose
any
one
who
attempted
it
in
this
country
would
sooner
or
later
be
cut
into
small
pieces
for
these
images
are
blessed
just
as
the
larger
one
but
there
is
another
reason
against
attempting
such
a
thing
you
are
a
very
wonderful
race
you
chinese
and
you
were
more
wonderful
still
generations
ago
ah
wu
ling
murmured
there
are
plenty
of
people
the
young
man
proceeded
who
say
that
there
is
scarcely
a
discovery
in
the
world
which
you
have
not
anticipated
and
then
declined
to
use
because
the
central
tenet
of
your
religion
and
your
philosophy
was
to
leave
things
that
are
well
they
say
that
you
discovered
gunpowder
and
all
manner
of
explosives
about
the
time
these
images
were
fashioned
they
must
always
from
the
first
have
been
intended
for
a
possible
hiding
place
for
the
old
legend
concerning
them
i
know
this
from
the
only
european
who
has
ever
visited
the
temple
declared
that
if
these
are
subjected
to
violence
in
any
way
then
the
earthquake
follows
the
priests
all
believe
this
implicitly
and
although
it
sounds
a
idea
the
man
who
first
told
me
the
story
is
convinced
that
when
the
jewels
were
stored
away
inside
they
were
imbedded
in
some
sort
of
explosive
it
becomes
more
than
ever
a
strange
story
wu
ling
said
didactically
the
young
man
looked
searchingly
for
a
moment
at
his
host
was
it
his
fancy
he
wondered
or
was
there
a
faint
note
of
sardonic
disbelief
in
his
even
tone
of
course
he
went
on
it
must
sound
to
you
as
it
does
to
me
although
you
would
scarcely
understand
the
word
like
rot
but
the
man
from
whom
i
heard
it
was
a
great
person
in
pekin
a
friend
even
of
the
emperor
and
not
only
of
the
emperor
but
of
the
emperor
great
adviser
whom
some
people
think
the
greatest
chinaman
who
ever
lived
he
had
privileges
which
had
never
before
been
extended
to
any
european
wu
ling
nodded
gravely
so
he
said
with
the
painstaking
air
of
one
trying
to
solve
a
problem
you
were
seeking
to
take
images
from
temple
away
from
priests
to
whom
belong
that
you
might
possess
jewels
the
young
man
coughed
somehow
or
other
wu

eyes
were
very
penetrating
well
he
admitted
i
suppose
in
a
way
it
was
robbery
but
robbery
on
a
legitimate
scale
i
do
suppose
you
read
much
european
history
have
you
read
never
wu

replied
that
makes
it
difficult
to
explain
his
companion
regretted
pausing
for
a
moment
to
breathe
in
with
great
satisfaction
a
gulp
of
the
cool
night
air
however
most
of
the
territories
in
different
parts
of
the
world
which
england
possesses
and
a
great
deal
of
her
inherited
wealth
have
come
because
centuries
ago
englishmen
went
across
the
seas
to
every
country
in
the
world
and
helped
themselves
to
pretty
well
what
they
wanted
that
wu

remarked
sounds
like
wu
abst
the
pirate
gregory
ballaston
smiled
well
he
continued
the
invasion
of
a
foreign
country
for
purposes
of
aggrandisement
is
robbery
i
suppose
only
you
see
it
is
robbery
on
a
big
scale
we
looked
at
this
present
affair
in
the
same
way
if
it
is
true
that
there
are
a
million
pounds
worth
of
jewels
in
these
images
what
good
can
they
possibly
do
to
any
one
hidden
there
for
centuries
no
one
could
see
them
no
one
could
derive
any
good
from
them
their
very
beauty
is
lost
to
the

if
you
like
wu

but
not
petty
larceny
wu

shook
his
head
with
an
uncomprehending
smile
of
course
you
wo
understand
that
the
other
observed
still
what
i
mean
to
say
is
that
the
very
danger
of
the
exploit
the
fact
that
you
risk
your
life
look
how
near
i
came
to
losing
mine
makes
the
enterprise
almost
worth
while
nothing
mean
about
it
anyway
ah
wu
ling
murmured
meditatively
and
now
please
tell
where
images
the
young
man
was
silent
that
a
long
story
wu

he
sighed
there
were
two
of
us
in
this
the
other
got
away
he
did
desert
me
exactly
it
was
according
to
plan
but
he
had
to
leave
first
and
he
left
damned
quick
and
the
images
wu
ling
persisted
softly
gregory
ballaston
leaned
back
the
night
had
become
a
thing
of
splendour
the
water
no
longer
yellow
but
glittering
with
the
reflection
of
the
moon
they
were
passing
through
a
narrow
strip
of
country
which
might
have
been
the
garden
of
some
great
palace
there
were
flowering
shrubs
down
to
the
river
edge
a
faint
perfume
of
almond
blossom
in
the
distance
a
stronger
scent
of
something
like
eucalyptus
and
all
the
time
a
divine
silence
after
his
terrible
quarters
in
the
pirate
ship
this
was
a
dream
of
luxury
the
young
man
was
full
of
gratitude
to
his
benefactor
and
yet
he
hesitated
could
one
trust
any
chinaman
even
though
he
has
saved
one
life
with
a
secret
like
this
the
images
no
longer
stand
in
the
temple
wu
ling
he
said
but
just
where
they
are
now
i
do
not
know
it
was
my
part
of
the
affair
if
you
understand
military
language
to
fight
a
rearguard
action
i
did
but
there
were
too
many
of
them
for
me
they
fought
like
furies
those
priests
i
might
have
killed
them
but
i
had
the
heart
to
do
it
i
shot
one
or
two
in
the
limbs
and
then
chucked
it
when
i
saw
it
was
no
use
whether
my
friend
succeeded
in
getting
away
with
the
images
or
not
i
shall
not
know
for
many
days
they
passed
a
tiny
village
from
a
plastered
house
with
a
curving
roof
two
lanterns
were
hanging
a
girl
figure
was
dimly
visible
through
the
strings
of
thin
bamboo
rustling
musically
together
in
the
breeze
she
was
singing
to
a
kind
of
guitar
an
amazing
melody
uncouth
in
its
way
and
unintelligible
yet
the
young
man
turned
over
and
smiled
as
he
listened

there
no
other

but

be
desired

even
in

clasped
his

behind
his

he
was
gazing
steadily
up
at
the
stars
listening
to
the
melody
dying
away
in
the
distance
although
he
addressed
his
companion
he
had
the
air
of
one
soliloquising
the

he
said
the

it
all

but
then
the

it
slipped
out
of

somehow
during

are

murmured
you

have
come
so
far
and

the

looked
round
the

was
a

of
rifles
against

passed
out

walking
to

stood
pensively
watching

the
trader
chinese
representative
of
the
great
house
of
johnson
and
company
at
home
and
amongst
his
merchandise
was
strangely
installed
he
sat
in
the
remote
corner
of
a
huge
warehouse
packed
from
floor
to
ceiling
with
an
amazingly
heterogeneous
collection
of
all
manner
of
articles
there
were
bales
of
cotton
and
calico
goods
from
manchester
woollens
from
bradford
cases
of
firearms
from
birmingham
and
six
great
crates
of
american
bicycles
in
the
foreground
a
ford
automobile
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
floor
and
farther
back
in
the
recesses
of
the
room
which
seemed
to
be
of
no
particular
shape
and
which
wandered
into
many
corners
were
piles
of
chinese
silks
shelf
after
shelf
of
china
bowls
and
ivory
statuettes
hanging
from
the
walls
were
mandarins
robes
of
green
and
blue
embroidered
with
silks
fragments
of
brocade
and
one
great
pictorial
representation
of
the
grounds
of
an
emperor
palace
woven
with
miraculous
skill
into
a
background
of
pale
blue
material
from
the
more
distant
parts
of
the
warehouse
came
an
insidious
pungent
odour
as
of
a
perfume
from
which
the
life
had
gone
but
the
faintness
of
which
remained
a
perfume
which
spread
itself
with
gentle
insistence
into
every
corner
of
the
place
and
seemed
to
envelop
even
its
more
sordid
details
with
an
air
of
mystery
in
the
great
open
yard
chinamen
were
packing
and
unpacking
in
amazing
silence
the
only
sound
in
the
warehouse
itself
came
from
the
clicking
of
a
typewriter
before
which
on
a
plain
deal
bench
was
seated
a
youth
in
european
clothes
from
outside
there
drifted
in
through
the
open
window
in
a
confused
medley
the
strange
noises
of
the
quay
the
patter
of
naked
feet
the
shrill
cry
of
the
porters
and
occasional
screech
of
a
siren
a
white
mist
hung
over
the
harbour
a
hot
damp
mist
concealing
in
patches
the
tangled
mass
of

into
this
curious
chamber
of

ushered
by
a
chinese
boy
came
gregory

the
englishman
whom
wu

had
rescued
a
short
while
ago
the
chinese
boy
murmured
something
and
departed
wu
ling
nodded
a
welcome
to
his
visitor
a
grave
reserved
welcome
no
gone
england
yet
he
observed
the
young
man
sank
into
the
chair
which
the
other
gesture
indicated
he
had
evidently
found
his
clothes
for
he
was
very
correctly
dressed
in
the
european
fashion
his
manner
was
and
his
voice
level
nevertheless
his
pallor
was
almost
ghastly
and
there
were
still
blue
lines
under
his
eyes
he
had
the
air
of
a
man
who
has
been
through
some
form
of
suffering
you
have
heard
the
story
of
my
friend

he
asked
the
chinaman
shook
his
head
and
pointed
around
much
affairs
he
explained
very
busy
smoke

gregory
ballaston
helped
himself
from
the
open
box
my
friend
got
away
he
recounted
reached
pekin
and
got
safely
on
to
the
train
at
some
place
on
the
way
here
the
train
was
held
up
there
seems
to
have
been
confusion
for
an
hour
or
so
when
the
soldiers
arrived
my
friend
was
found
with
his
throat
cut
and
the
chinaman
who
had
been
his
guide
and
interpreter
was
killed
too
wu
ling
inclined
his
head
gravely
the
story
was
not
an
unusual
one
robbers
in
china
are
bad
men
he
declared
and
the
images
the
young
englishman
touched
his
forehead
the
heat
was
great
and
there
were
drops
of
moisture
upon
his
fingers
one
was
still
amongst
the
train
baggage
he
confided
it
is
now
safely
on
board
the
steamer
the
other
was
taken
away
by
the
robbers
wu
ling
reflected
for
several
moments
looking
downward
upon
the
table
he
seemed
indisposed
for
speech
and
presently
his
visitor
continued
of
course
he
went
on
according
to
the
superstition
one
is
supposed
to
be
worthless
without
the
other
i
am
going
to
risk
that
however
mine
is
under
lock
and
key
in
the
purser
safe
and
i
even
look
at
it
until
we
well
out
of
these
seas
the
steamer
sail
at
four
wu
ling
remarked
glancing
at
a
chart
the
young
man
nodded
i
have
been
on
board
already
he
said
i
came
back
to
pay
my
promised
call
upon
you
and
to
thank
you
once
more
for
all
you
did
for
me
wu
ling
waved
his
hand
it
was
nothing
he
declared
wu
abst
bad
man
if
he
had
killed
you
there
would
have
been
trouble
on
the
river
my
trading
all
disturbed
you
safe
now
better
leave
the
image
behind
i
damned
if
i
do
was
the
emphatic
reply
it
cost
my
pal
life
and
very
nearly
mine
i
am
going
to
stick
to
it
wu
ling
was
thoughtful
apparently
he
was
watching
some
of
the
porters
at
work
in
a
distant
corner
of
the
warehouse
which
image
you
have
he
enquired
body
or
soul
i
have
undone
the
case
the
young
man
answered
i
do
care
which
it
is
so
long
as
the
jewels
are
in
it
you
think
you
get
the
jewels
wu
ling
asked
gently
if
they
are
there
i
shall
was
the
dogged
reply
superstitions
are
all
very
well
in
a
way
but
a
wooden
image
is
a
wooden
image
after
all
wu
ling
said
nothing
there
was
a
curious
significance
about
his
silence
which
seemed
somehow
to
embarrass
his
visitor
who
rose
presently
to
his
feet
and
looked
around
he
was
inspired
with
a
desire
to
change
the
conversation
what
an
amazing
place
this
is
he
exclaimed
i
suppose
you
have
some
wonderful
chinese
things
we
spend
life
collecting
them
wu
ling
answered
in
return
you
see
what
we
give
pointing
to
the
bales
of
calico
and
woollen
goods
and
the
crates
of
bicycles
perhaps
you
care
buy
some
curios
gregory
ballaston
shook
his
head
no
money
he
confessed
i
shall
have
to
get
a
credit
from
the
purser
as
it
is
wu
ling
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
come
he
enjoined
i
show
you
something
follow
the
young
man
not
altogether
willing
followed
his
guide
to
the
extreme
end
of
that
amazing
warehouse
through
a
recess
into
a
further
dark
room
also
filled
with
a
strange
conglomeration
of
articles
from
which
seemed
to
come
with
even
more
troublous
insistence
the
same
curious
odour
lifeless
yet
disturbing
beyond
was
still
another
door
towards
which
wu
ling
made
his
way
his
companion
hesitated
i
have
not
a
great
deal
of
time
he
said
i
want
to
see
the
consul
before
the
place
closes
you
have
time
to
see
what
i
shall
show
was
the
almost
ominous
rejoinder
they
paused
before
the
door
which
to
ballaston
surprise
was
studded
with
great
nails
and
of
enormous
strength
wu
ling
produced
a
long
thin
key
from
his
pocket
which
he
inserted
into
a
very
aperture
the
door
swung
ponderously
open
inside
there
was
no
window
nor
apparently
any
form
of
ventilation
and
again
that
odour
cloying
and
nauseating
swept
out
in
stabbing
little
wafts
almost
stupefying
the
young
man
confronted
with
a
pool
of
darkness
would
have
drawn
back
but
there
was
suddenly
a
grip
upon
his
arm
like
a
ring
of
iron
wait
wu
ling
ordered
there
shall
be
light
and
immediately
there
was
from
some
unseen
switch
the
dark
chamber
was
flooded
with
the
illumination
of
many
electric
bulbs
ballaston
gasped
as
he
looked
around
it
was
almost
as
though
he
had
found
his
way
into
some
aladdin
cave
on
shelves
of
red
highly
polished
wood
were
ranged
lumps
of
jade
and
quartz
bowls
of
ancient
china
of
which
even
his
inexperience
could
gauge
the
pricelessness
silk
coats
faded
but
marvellously
embroidered
barbaric
stones
in
open
trays
a
great
circlet
of
malay
pearls
and
on
a
shelf
alone
staring
at
him
bland
and
unmistakable
the
other
of
the
twin
images
which
he
and
his
friend
had
dragged
down
from
their
pedestals
in
the
temple
ballaston
stared
at
it
speechless
the
face
itself
had
a
touch
of
sphinxlike
mysticism
the
remoteness
of
a
god
the
benevolence
of
a
kindly
spirit
the
work
in
it
seemed
so
slight
the
result
so
prodigious
ballaston
found
words
at
last
the
other
image
he
cried
where
did
you
get
it
in
this
city
wu

explained
nothing
of
this
sort
is
sold
unless
it
come
first
to
us
three
nights
since
there
appeared
a
messenger
i
sought
the
man
from
whom
he
came
at
his
hiding
place
in
the
city
with
him
i
traded
for
the
image
you
purchased
it
the
young
man
gasped
whom
else
was
the
composed
reply
in
this
country
from
the
dark
forests
of
northern
mongolia
the
temples
of
pekin
or
the
mines
on
the
siberian
borders
all
that
there
is
for
which
men
seek
gold
comes
here
we
pay
they
sell
but
you
ca
keep
it
ballaston
exclaimed
not
in
this
country
the
priests
will
hear
you
will
be
forced
to
return
it
if
it
belongs
to
any
one
he
stopped
short
wu
ling
read
his
thoughts
and
smiled
the
priests
of
the
temple
which
you
and
your
accomplice
ravaged
he
announced
live
no
longer
they
were
murdered
by
the
people
many
days
ago
for
their
sin
in
permitting
you
to
enter
the
temple
furthermore
the
images
are
now
defiled
the
hand
of
the
foreigner
has
touched
them
they
can
never
again
take
their
place
by
the
side
of
the
great
buddha
you
bought
with
blood
and
i
with
gold
there
was
the
sound
of
shuffling
footsteps
close
at
hand
an
elderly
man
dressed
in
shabby
european
clothes
stood
behind
them
he
looked
over
their
shoulders
at
the
image
and
there
was
for
a
moment
almost
a
glow
in
his
worn
and
lined
face
this
wu
ling
confided
is
a
man
of
your
race
he
is
of
the
firm
a
partner
not
because
of
business
but
because
he
is
a
great
scholar
he
reads
strange
tongues
manuscripts
from
the
monasteries
of
thibet
the
archives
of
ancient
china
he
was
once
a
professor
at
one
of
your
universities
professor
endacott
he
is
now
of
the
firm
of
johnson
and
company
the
newcomer
acknowledged
indifferently
the
young
man
greeting
you
are
looking
at
a
very
wonderful
piece
of
carving
he
said
i
once
spent
a
year
in
pekin
to
see
that
and
its
companion
image
young
man
has
other
wu
ling
explained
blandly
he
and
friend
stole
both
from
temple
this
one
come
here
you
know
how
the
other
he
has
on
ship
taking
with
him
to
england
endacott
whole
frame
seemed
to
stiffen
he
frowned
heavily
his
tone
carried
a
note
of
sarcasm
which
might
have
belonged
to
the
days
of
his
professorship
the
young
man
has
chosen
as
he
would
he
remarked
he
possesses
the
body
and
here
still
in
the
land
which
gave
it
immortality
remains
the
soul
now
they
are
separated
what
will
you
do
with
your
image
young
man
if
you
reach
your
country
safely
there
is
a
legend
of
hidden
jewels
was
the
eager
reply
you
perhaps
know
of
it
i
know
the
legend
well
the
other
admitted
there
is
treasure
in
one
perhaps
in
both
which
do
you
think
might
hold
the
jewels
the
body
or
the
soul
i
am
hoping
that
there
are
some
in
mine
anyhow
ballaston
answered
that
may
be
was
the
tranquil
comment
on
the
other
hand
we
may
find
the
whole
story
to
be
an
allegory
you
may
discover
nothing
but
emptiness
and
disappointment
in
the
body
here
at
least
in
the
soul
you
find
reflected
by
the
divine
skill
of
the
craftsman
the
jewels
of
pure
living
and
spiritual
thought
you
were
of
oxford
young
man
magdalen
you
have
the
air
nearly
all
of
your
age
and
small
vision
scoff
in
your
hearts
at
any
religion
which
may
seek
to
express
the
qualities
for
which
that
image
stands
it
is
your
that
you
have
the
body
when
you
are
home
you
will
unpack
your
case
you
will
place
the
image
amongst
your
treasures
and
i
can
tell
you
even
though
it
is
thirty
years
since
i
saw
it
what
you
will
see
you
will
see
a
brooding
face
and
eyes
cast
down
to
the
dunghills
you
will
see
thick
lips
and
coarse
features
you
will
see
expressed
as
glaringly
as
here
you
see
the
triumph
of
the
spirit
the
debasement
of
the
body
you
will
watch
your
image
and
you
will
sink
you
will
never
look
at
it
you
or
others
without
conceiving
an
unworthy
thought
just
as
you
could
never
look
upon
this
one
without
feeling
that
some
one
has
stretched
down
his
hand
that
somewhere
there
is
a
murmur
of
sweet
voices
speaking
to
you
from
above
the
clouds
but
the
jewels
the
young
man
persisted
bah
endacott
muttered
as
he
turned
on
his
heel
ballaston
with
wondering
eyes
watched
the
erstwhile
professor
disappear
looney
he
murmured
under
his
breath
i
desire
pardon
wu
ling
interpolated
politely
a
madman
wu
ling
smiled
he
is
a
personage
of
great
learning
he
declared
he
is
a
friend
of
chinese
scholars
who
have
never
spoken
to
any
other
foreigner
he
has
great
knowledge
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
that
ballaston
asked
motioning
towards
the
image
wu
ling
sighed
he
stood
for
a
moment
in
silent
thought
his
eyes
fixed
upon
his
treasure
then
gently
and
almost
with
reverence
he
turned
away
beckoned
his
companion
to
precede
him
passed
out
and
locked
the
door
who
can
tell
he
ruminated
we
have
a
great
warehouse
here
filled
with
strange
goods
as
you
see
another
and
larger
in
alexandria
an
agent
in
new
york
all
the
things
come
and
go
we
do
not
hurry
we
have
jade
there
which
we
have
not
even
spoken
of
for
twenty
years
silk
robes
from
the
chests
of
him
who
was
emperor
ivory
carvings
from
his
summer
palace
denied
even
to
the
great
merchants
perhaps
we
sell
perhaps
not
you
must
be
rolling
in
money
the
young
man
sighed
i
desire
pardon
wu
ling
rejoined
mystified
you
must
be
wealthy
very
rich
wu
ling
smiled
tolerantly
he
turned
back
swung
open
once
more
the
door
and
turned
on
the
light
he
pointed
to
the
image
serene
and
benevolent
what
counts
money
he
murmured
they
were
about
halfway
through
the
outer
warehouse
on
their
way
to
the
lighter
room
beyond
when
a
thing
happened
so
amazing
that
ballaston
stopped
short
and
gripped
his
companion
by
the
shoulder
returning
towards
them
was
endacott
and
by
his
side
a
girl
she
was
dressed
simply
enough
in
the
white
clothes
and
shady
straw
hat
which
the
climate
demanded
but
there
were
other
things
which
made
her
appearance
in
such
a
place
curiously
incongruous
she
broke
off
in
her
conversation
and
looked
at
gregory
ballaston
in
frank
astonishment
it
was
certainly
an
unusual
meeting
place
for
two
young
people
of
the
modern
world
i
am
taking
my
niece
to
see
our
new
treasure
endacott
observed
a
little
stiffly
will
you
lend
me
the
key
wu
ling
or
will
you
take
us
back
yourself
i
will
return
wu
ling
replied
gravely
the
young
gentleman
will
excuse
if
i
too
might
be
permitted
one
more
glimpse
ballaston
begged
the
girl
smiled
at
him
and
glanced
at
her
companion
endacott
recalled
the
conventions
of
his
past
i
should
like
my
dear
he
said
to
present
our
young
visitor
to
you
but
i
am
not
sure
that
i
remember
his
name
or
that
i
have
even
heard
it
ballaston
the
young
man
interposed
with
some
eagerness
gregory
ballaston
this
then
is
my
niece
miss
claire
endacott
the
proceeded
she
will
be
your
fellow
traveller
i
imagine
if
you
leave
on
steamer
the
two
young
people
shook
hands
and
they
all
turned
back
into
the
recesses
of
the
warehouse
you
are
coming
to
england
ballaston
asked
she
nodded
it
is
so
nice
to
meet
some
one
who
is
going
to
be
on
the
ship
she
said
i
came
from
new
york
here
last
month
knowing
scarcely
a
soul
after
that
they
remained
without
speech
for
a
few
moments
somehow
or
other
their
surroundings
and
their
mission
seemed
to
demand
silence
wu
ling
gravely
opened
the
door
and
turned
up
the
light
the
girl
drew
a
little
breath
of
joy
as
she
gazed
at
the
image
but
that
is
wonderful
she
exclaimed
it
is
the
work
of
a
great
master
her
uncle
explained
gravely
the
hand
which
fashioned
that
image
was
the
hand
of
a
man
who
knew
the
secrets
of
the
ages
who
came
as
near
the
knowledge
of
what
eternity
means
as
any
man
may
there
is
much
to
think
about
little
to
speak
of
their
silence
was
the
silence
of
entrancement
ballaston
attention
alone
curiously
distracted
it
was
a
strange
environment
for
her
modern
and
vivid
beauty
this
chamber
with
its
clinging
odours
its
ancient
treasures
of
silk
and
ivory
the
image
gazing
serenely
past
them
wu
ling
and
endacott
himself
seemed
entirely
in
the
setting
the
girl
with
her
masses
of
yellow
hair
and
almost
eagerly
joyous
expression
a
butterfly
wandered
by
chance
into
a
vault
yet
he
had
another
impression
of
her
before
they
left
he
caught
a
glimpse
of
her
parted
lips
the
strained
light
in
her
clear
grey
eyes
as
though
in
a
sense
her
spiritual
self
were
reaching
out
towards
the
allegory
of
the
image
then
her
uncle
gave
the
signal
wu
ling
gravely
switched
off
the
light
and
they
trooped
back
into
the
warehouse
somehow
the
girl
reflected
i
suppose
it
is
because
i
have
just
come
from
the
art
classes
and
the
museums
of
new
york
i
feel
as
though
that
were
the
first
real
thing
i
have
ever
seen
in
my
life
chapter
iii
well
claire
exclaimed
laughing
at
gregory
ballaston
across
the
table
how
have
you
enjoyed
your
dinner
immensely
he
answered
with
enthusiasm
have
you
ever
dined
more
strangely
i
do
think
i
have
he
confessed
it
was
most
frightfully
kind
of
your
uncle
to
ask
me
i
was
never
so
surprised
in
my
life
nor
i
she
admitted
candidly
to
tell
you
the
truth
when
we
all
came
together
in
the
warehouse
this
afternoon
it
seemed
to
me
from
his
manner
that
you
were
not
particularly
good
friends
and
i
was
afraid
he
was
going
to
hurry
me
off
without
a
word
then
your
intense
curiosity
to
have
another
look
at
that
image
entirely
assumed
he
interrupted
i
wanted
a
chance
to
be
introduced
to
you
of
course
that
was
in
the
least
obvious
she
laughed
anyhow
even
then
i
never
dreamed
of
this
it
was
just
when
you
were
going
that
he
asked
your
name
again
and
seemed
so
interested
do
you
realise
that
he
must
know
something
about
you
or
your
family
i
wondered
gregory
admitted
she
glanced
at
the
door
through
which
her
uncle
had
disappeared
in
search
of
cigarettes
anyhow
she
continued
it
is
delightful
to
think
that
you
are
going
to
be
a
fellow
passenger
on
the
kalatat
do
you
sympathise
with
me
for
being
rather
glad
to
get
away
from
here
he
looked
around
at
the
almost
empty
room
at
the
comfortless
linoleum
upon
the
floor
the
chinese
servants
moving
like
ghosts
about
the
table
at
the
chairs
the
few
articles
of
cheap
furniture
it
was
an
amazing
environment
your
uncle
he
remarked
a
little
hesitatingly
apart
from
his
household
surroundings
seems
to
be
a
man
of
great
taste
he
has
wonderful
knowledge
she
said
and
a
wonderful
sense
of
beauty
but
he
lives
absolutely
within
himself
i
am
perfectly
certain
he
does
know
that
he
has
eaten
curried
chicken
and
rice
every
night
for
a
week
why
if
i
had
thought
of
it
we
have
had
nothing
but
water
for
dinner
you
a
good
samaritan
he
murmured
come
and
sit
outside
she
invited
the
verandah
is
the
only
possible
place
here
we
a
great
deal
too
near
the
rest
of
the
houses
but
the
city
looks
almost
beautiful
now
the
lights
are
out
and
the
harbour
is
wonderful
the
chairs
as
you
will
discover
are
horrible
and
there
is
a
cushion
in
the
place
tell
me
about
yourself
he
begged
when
they
were
established
and
why
you
came
here
you
see
she
confided
endacott
brother
my
father
was
a
professor
at
harvard
he
died
when
i
was
eleven
years
old
and
my
mother
died
a
year
afterwards
i
was
sent
to
boarding
school
in
boston
and
new
york
when
i
was
nineteen
i
was
to
be
sent
either
to
an
aunt
in
england
or
to
my
uncle
here
my
aunt
in
england
lives
at
a
place
which
reminds
me
of
your
name
market
ballaston
it
is
called
he
looked
at
her
in
astonishment
why
that
is
where
i
live
he
exclaimed
tell
me
your
aunt
name
de
fourgenet
she
replied
she
married
a
frenchman
the
comte
de
fourgenet
good
god
madame
madame
that
is
what
we
call
your
aunt
in
the
neighbourhood
he
explained
she
is
my
father
greatest
friend
you
know
of
course
that
she
is
an
invalid
i
have
heard
so
the
girl
admitted
a
motor
accident
was
it
uncle
she
went
on
as
he
stepped
through
the
window
do
you
realise
that
ballaston
knows
aunt
angèle
i
imagined
that
he
might
endacott
acknowledged
a
little
drily
it
was
not
until
i
heard
your
name
for
the
second
time
he
continued
turning
to
the
younger
man
that
i
realised
who
you
must
be
it
is
a
very
small
world
gregory
ballaston
remarked
tritely
as
he
accepted
one
of
the
cigars
which
endacott
was
offering
geographically
it
has
contracted
for
me
during
the
last
years
into
a
radius
of
a
few
miles
round
the
city
here
endacott
confided
to
come
back
into
the
world
again
at
my
time
of
life
will
seem
strange
but
you
wo
really
mind
it
the
girl
assured
him
you
will
find
a
country
house
not
too
far
from
aunt
angèle
you
will
have
all
your
manuscripts
your
books
your
treasures
round
you
it
is
true
is
it
that
you
sit
in
your
little
office
every
day
without
stirring
why
you
can
do
the
same
thing
in
england
as
here
and
then
there
must
be
some
of
your
old
oxford
friends
who
would
like
to
see
you
endacott
smiled
thinly
thirty
years
he
reminded
her
is
a
long
way
to
look
back
to
pick
up
the
threads
the
friendships
dropped
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
ago
is
not
easy
at
the
same
time
he
went
on
it
is
right
that
i
should
return
to
england
it
marches
well
with
affairs
here
you
must
have
found
the
life
out
in
these
parts
very
interesting
sir
gregory
ballaston
remarked
i
do
know
whether
it
would
get
monotonous
to
you
but
to
any
one
coming
upon
it
suddenly
it
is
an
amazing
corner
of
the
world
off
the
ship
i
have
only
seen
three
europeans
since
i
have
been
here
it
is
for
that
reason
endacott
pointed
out
an
unsuitable
place
for
my
niece
my
establishment
here
too
is
impossible
no
european
woman
could
keep
house
under
the
prevailing
conditions
that
is
why
i
am
hurrying
my
niece
off
although
i
myself
shall
follow
before
long
my
father
will
be
interested
to
see
you
again
gregory
ventured
your
father
if
his
tastes
had
lain
that
way
endacott
ruminated
might
have
been
a
brilliant
scholar
he
preferred
sport
and
life
we
met
not
so
many
years
ago
in
pekin
he
was
dabbling
in
diplomacy
then
he
certainly
had
the
gifts
for
it
he
was
in
fact
the
most
popular
englishman
who
ever
appeared
at
the
court
there
he
was
received
and
granted
privileges
where
i
could
never
follow
him
he
was
i
suppose
your
instigator
in
this
buccaneering
expedition
of
yours
the
young
man
laughed
a
little
uneasily
there
had
been
a
vein
of
contempt
in
the
other
tone
i
suppose
it
must
have
seemed
a
horrible
piece
of
vandalism
to
you
sir
he
remarked
however
there
it
is
the
adventure
appealed
to
me
and
we
wanted
the
money
badly
enough
his
host
looked
out
across
the
harbour
at
the
swaying
lanterns
of
the
small
boats
and
beyond
to
the
great
lighthouse
money
he
repeated
the
password
of
the
west
somehow
i
never
thought
i
should
return
to
it
money
counts
for
something
out
here
too
gregory
protested
look
at
your
friend
and
partner
wu
ling
trading
up
the
river
with
machine
guns
and
rifles
to
protect
himself
for
what
to
make
money
he
doing
it
for
johnson
and
company
you
one
of
the
firm
mr
endacott
the
latter
nodded
touché
he
admitted
but
let
me
point
out
to
you
young
gentleman
that
the
things
wu
ling
brings
back
to
our
warehouses
are
things
of
beauty
which
he
pays
for
with
rubbish
gregory
rejoined
half
of
your
warehouse
is
an
abomination
the
other
half
i
admit
a
treasure
house
endacott
gently
inclined
his
head
i
can
not
defend
myself
he
acknowledged
i
am
a
partner
in
the
firm
because
they
insisted
all
my
savings
for
twenty
years
which
i
advanced
to
them
were
they
tell
me
the
foundation
from
which
the
business
has
been
built
up
but
believe
me
i
have
never
seen
inside
a
ledger
once
every
twelve
months
a
strange
little
man
brings
me
a
slip
of
paper
i
look
at
it
and
the
business
for
the
year
is
finished
it
is
perhaps
as
well
gregory
observed
that
your
associates
are
probably
honest
wu
ling
for
instance
wu
ling
is
an
amazing
person
endacott
pronounced
is
he
altogether
chinese
gregory
enquired
there
have
been
times
when
he
has
puzzled
me
no
one
but
wu
ling
knows
who
wu
ling
is
or
where
he
comes
from
was
the
enigmatic
reply
he
is
a
power
unto
himself
he
saved
my
life
gregory
remarked
but
i
do
think
that
he
approves
of
me
tell
me
ballaston
the
girl
asked
have
you
looked
at
your
image
yet
the
one
you
have
on
the
ship
not
yet
endacott
turned
his
head
he
was
seated
on
the
most
uncomfortable
of
the
three
uncomfortable
cane
chairs
a
stiff
unbending
figure
his
eyes
were
turned
speculatively
upon
his
visitor
if
there
be
any
truth
in
the
legend
he
advised
you
will
do
well
to
leave
it
in
its
case
gregory
was
doubtful
i
rather
wanted
to
examine
it
he
admitted
the
part
of
the
legend
which
interests
me
most
is
the
part
which
has
to
do
with
the
jewels
naturally
endacott
agreed
with
unconcealed
sarcasm
yet
in
the
story
of
the
fashioning
of
the
images
there
has
been
nothing
more
vehement
than
the
warning
issued
by
the
high
priest
in
whose
day
it
was
done
here
he
pointed
out
by
the
great
art
of
the
sculptor
the
body
and
soul
were
torn
apart
all
that
was
good
and
virtuous
and
that
made
towards
the
beautiful
in
life
was
carven
into
the
image
which
our
friend
wu
ling
seems
to
have
purchased
from
the
robber
all
that
was
debased
and
evil
and
which
prompted
towards
sin
was
graven
into
the
features
of
the
one
which
you
possess
together
side
by
side
they
were
supposed
to
make
up
the
sum
of
humanity
the
good
and
the
evil
balancing
side
by
side
they
might
be
looked
at
without
evil
effect
they
might
inspire
thought
reflection
of
the
highest
order
there
were
indications
there
of
what
to
avoid
what
passions
to
fight
against
indications
there
too
of
what
a
man
aim
should
be
how
to
uplift
oneself
above
sin
and
how
to
climb
always
in
one
thoughts
towards
the
spiritual
they
both
listened
fascinated
to
endacott
thin
reedy
voice
his
still
words
spoken
without
emphasis
or
enthusiasm
as
they
might
have
been
spoken
to
a
class
of
student
philosophers
it
was
the
girl
who
first
ventured
upon
a
question
but
uncle
she
demanded
you
do
seriously
believe
that
to
live
with
either
of
these
statues
without
the
other
could
really
affect
any
one
character
so
runs
the
legend
was
the
quiet
almost
solemn
reply
so
it
is
written
in
one
of
the
manuscripts
recording
their
history
the
superstition
if
it
be
a
superstition
has
at
least
a
logical
basis
an
environment
of
beauty
and
spirituality
tends
towards
holiness
an
environment
of
bestiality
must
on
the
other
hand
in
time
debase
before
these
images
were
fashioned
the
philosophers
of
past
ages
used
their
symbolism
for
a
text
thou
wouldst
be
holy
live
with
holy
and
spiritual
things
if
thou
wouldst
avoid
sin
turn
thy
back
upon
the
presentment
of
evil
but
you
do
really
suppose
sir
gregory
ventured
although
of
course
the
idea
is
beautiful
that
there
is
anything
supernatural
in
the
influence
which
those
images
might
bring
to
bear
upon
any
life
my
dear
young
man
endacott
expounded
i
do
not
even
know
what
empires
of
thought
the
word
supernatural
covers
i
have
pointed
out
the
logical
basis
for
such
a
teaching
that
is
all
we
are
in
a
world
here
where
one
does
not
lightly
reject
superstitions
in
the
west
there
exists
a
great
world
reared
to
the
gods
of
materialism
unwarmed
with
the
flame
of
spirituality
the
world
of
gold
and
stone
and
huge
banking
accounts
and
prosperous
cities
and
hurrying
hastening
lives
the
western
brain
holds
no
corner
for
superstitions
but
casts
them
scornfully
away
live
here
for
twenty
years
and
you
find
the
brain
more
elastic
its
cells
more
receptive
even
its
philosophy
less
inevitably
based
upon
the
fundamental
but
mathematical
principles
keep
your
image
in
its
packing
case
gregory
ballaston
it
will
be
time
enough
when
you
get
home
to
search
for
the
jewels
the
which
gregory
had
ordered
came
lumbering
up
the
hill
he
rose
with
reluctance
even
in
her
stiff
uncomfortable
chair
there
was
something
very
attractive
about
claire
as
she
lay
with
her
hands
clasped
behind
her
head
the
light
of
a
lantern
upon
her
suddenly
thoughtful
face
he
reflected
however
with
a
little
thrill
of
pleasure
that
for
six
weeks
she
would
be
more
or
less
his
companion
if
we
do
meet
again
before
i
sail
sir
he
begged
turning
towards
his
host
let
me
thank
you
for
your
hospitality
it
will
be
a
great
pleasure
to
see
you
and
your
niece
in
norfolk
this
must
be
our
farewell
for
the
present
at
any
rate
endacott
said
as
he
shook
hands
my
niece
is
going
on
board
early
morning
as
i
myself
have
a
meeting
to
attend
in
the
afternoon
my
respects
to
your
father
we
shall
meet
without
a
doubt
in
england
and
we
gregory
added
in
a
lower
tone
as
he
bent
over
his
young
hostess
fingers
shall
meet
before
then
she
looked
up
at
him
smiling
they
were
young
and
he
was
very
nevertheless
she
was
and
it
was
in
a
spirit
of
frank
comradeship
that
she
replied
i
know
that
we
shall
have
a
lovely
time
on
the
voyage
until
then
gregory
ballaston
was
carried
down
the
rough
road
past
the
tangle
of
high
modern
buildings
rabbit
warrens
of
humanity
past
the
plastered
and
wooden
structures
of
older
days
with
their
curved
roofs
and
narrow
windows
through
the
confused
streets
which
at
every
step
became
more
thronged
towards
the
harbour
taking
very
little
note
of
his
progress
his
thoughts
engrossed
his
mind
fixed
upon
one
problem
already
the
memory
of
that
strange
meal
amidst
surroundings
so
sordid
that
even
the
girl
presence
had
been
unable
to
modify
them
was
becoming
overshadowed
his
late
host
cold
words
of
advice
seemed
to
have
made
not
the
slightest
impression
upon
him
he
thought
of
the
small
packing
case
in
the
purser
office
with
almost
feverish
impatience
joyful
of
the
permission
to
sleep
on
board
for
the
night
anxious
only
for
the
moment
when
he
should
reach
the
quay
somehow
or
other
serious
stilted
talk
had
immensely
confirmed
his
belief
in
the
existence
of
the
jewels
and
as
for
the
rest
the
warning
he
had
received
this
in
all
probability
simply
proceeded
from
the
vapourings
of
a
mind
steeped
in
orientalism
the
mind
of
a
scholar
removed
for
half
a
lifetime
from
the
whole
world
of
common
sense
and
possibilities
morally
he
was
as
other
young
men
he
would
have
scorned
to
cheat
or
lie
he
had
an
inherited
sense
of
honour
and
a
sportsman
probity
a
mean
action
would
have
revolted
him
he
was
capable
of
a
great
one
he
was
a
little
selfish
a
little
narrow
in
his
pride
of
name
and
race
as
courageous
as
any
man
might
be
with
the
undoubted
conceit
of
his
class
such
as
he
was
he
had
no
fear
of
change
he
had
never
indulged
in
he
accepted
himself
for
what
he
was
which
on
the
whole
was
something
a
little
better
than
the
average
he
had
no
presentiment
of
even
temporary
as
he
stepped
into
the
ship
boat
waiting
by
the
quay
and
looked
eagerly
across
the
harbour
to
where
the
great
steamer
lay
anchored
with
her
blazing
line
of
lights
chapter
iv
at
very
nearly
the
hour
of
his
former
visit
gregory
ballaston
entered
the
warehouse
of
johnson
and
company
on
the
following
morning
wu
ling
seated
at
his
table
waved
away
the
native
foreman
to
whom
he
was
giving
orders
and
glanced
enquiringly
at
his
visitor
ship
not
gone
he
asked
we
do
sail
until
the
afternoon
gregory
reminded
him
have
got
all
our
fresh
stores
shipped
or
something
i
came
back
to
have
a
talk
do
you
mind
wu
ling
gesture
was
noncommittal
the
young
man
continued
last
night
he
confided
sinking
into
a
chair
i
unpacked
my
image
i
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
with
my
porthole
closed
and
my
door
locked
although
i
imagine
that
now
that
the
priests
are
dead
there
is
no
fear
of
my
being
wu
ling
i
wish
to
god
that
you
were
an
englishman
why
for
i
could
talk
to
you
more
easily
there
was
a
brief
silence
wu
ling
stolid
powerful
imperturbable
sat
with
his
keen
enquiring
eyes
fixed
upon
his
visitor
gregory
showed
signs
of
some
slight
relapse
from
his
of
the
day
before
his
natural
bronzed
complexion
which
had
almost
reasserted
itself
seemed
to
have
given
place
again
to
the
pallor
which
denoted
a
sleepless
night
there
were
lines
under
his
eyes
a
restlessness
in
his
manner
you
found
image
bad
company
wu
ling
enquired
i
hate
the
beastly
thing
already
gregory
acknowledged
wu
ling
clapped
his
hands
softly
together
the
screen
of
bamboos
was
pushed
to
one
side
and
endacott
appeared
he
had
discarded
his
european
clothes
in
favour
of
the
dress
of
a
native
chinese
gentleman
and
he
carried
a
white
umbrella
our
young
friend
again
he
remarked
with
a
brief
salutation
wu
ling
pointed
to
a
chair
he
wish
talk
to
you
endacott
glanced
at
his
watch
before
he
sat
down
i
am
about
to
visit
the
head
of
the
chinese
university
here
he
announced
a
man
of
rare
intelligence
and
great
learning
why
should
i
waste
my
time
have
you
found
the
jewels
in
your
image
mr
ballaston
not
a
sign
of
them
up
to
the
present
sir
gregory
admitted
i
am
not
very
happy
about
them
either
as
you
know
the
whole
thing
was
a
pretty
dangerous
enterprise
and
i
only
half
succeeded
the
image
is
heavy
enough
but
i
ca
see
any
possible
aperture
anywhere
the
recovery
of
the
jewels
endacott
remarked
leaning
a
little
forward
with
his
hands
clasped
upon
the
knob
of
his
umbrella
was
scarcely
likely
to
be
a
simple
matter
i
realise
that
gregory
confessed
already
i
am
beginning
to
feel
a
sort
of
hatred
of
the
thing
for
the
first
time
last
night
he
went
on
i
felt
inclined
to
take
seriously
what
wu
ling
here
and
you
have
said
of
these
images
that
neither
of
them
has
any
real
existence
separately
side
by
side
they
have
looked
down
upon
that
procession
of
worshippers
through
all
these
years
side
by
side
they
must
be
you
have
told
me
according
to
the
superstition
if
the
jewels
are
to
be
found
endacott
inclined
his
head
our
young
friend
is
showing
signs
of
intelligence
he
admitted
he
is
beginning
to
travel
along
the
lines
of
the
allegory
if
this
is
true
gregory
asked
bluntly
what
is
the
use
of
my
taking
one
to
england
and
leaving
the
other
here
in
this
warehouse
the
only
reason
for
such
a
course
seems
to
be
his
companion
murmured
that
one
does
not
belong
to
you
perhaps
you
can
trade
with
the
firm
i
myself
am
not
a
trader
wu
ling
is
wu
ling
i
am
sure
is
at
your
disposal
how
can
i
trade
gregory
demanded
what
do
you
suppose
brought
me
out
here
on
an
enterprise
like
this
love
of
adventure
a
good
deal
i
grant
you
but
behind
it
all
sheer
and
absolute
need
of
money
we
are
poor
in
england
endacott
we
people
with
estates
i
have
the
money
to
buy
your
image
after
my
experience
of
last
night
i
would
rather
consider
an
offer
from
you
for
mine
wu
ling
smiled
he
talked
for
a
moment
in
chinese
to
his
companion
the
latter
showed
signs
of
agreement
wu
ling
attitude
is
mine
endacott
pronounced
if
by
any
chance
you
had
acquired
the
statue
we
possess
and
we
had
yours
the
firm
of
johnson
and
company
would
trade
not
now
we
are
content
then
you
do
believe
in
your
own
allegory
gregory
queried
wu
ling
was
looking
into
the
dark
recesses
of
the
warehouse
there
was
nothing
to
indicate
that
he
had
heard
or
understood
but
it
was
he
who
replied
yes
i
believe
in
it
he
admitted
we
both
believe
in
it
but
we
have
many
jewels
and
i
think
that
these
will
be
hard
to
find
if
you
had
both
the
images
gregory
suggested
you
could
break
them
up
endacott
raised
his
hand
to
his
forehead
as
though
in
pain
wu
ling
expression
appeared
unchanged
yet
somehow
or
other
he
gave
one
the
impression
of
having
listened
with
distaste
to
words
of
blasphemy
you
speak
like
a
huckster
from
the
new
cities
endacott
said
wearily
they
are
great
works
of
art
these
images
sanctified
by
the
years
alive
by
virtue
of
their
greatness
to
raise
a
hand
against
them
would
be
barbarous
besides
wu
ling
and
i
believe
the
legend
we
believe
that
those
will
die
who
treat
the
images
roughly
gregory
remained
discontented
he
took
a
cigarette
from
the
large
wooden
box
which
wu
ling
pushed
towards
him
the
box
was
of
some
sort
of
sandalwood
but
it
too
seemed
to
give
out
the
peculiar
odour
of
the
place
last
night
he
confided
when
i
sat
alone
with
my
image
it
came
back
to
me
how
my
father
himself
had
insisted
upon
the
necessity
for
securing
both
images
he
too
must
have
been
impressed
by
the
legend
he
think
my
errand
a
failure
if
i
return
with
one
without
money
how
buy
wu
ling
asked
johnson
and
company
we
are
traders
for
gold
we
sell
anything
on
earth
without
gold
how
can
buy
it
is
a
problem
gregory
admitted
gloomily
you
had
perhaps
a
proposition
endacott
suggested
something
of
the
sort
that
is
why
i
came
to
see
you
this
morning
i
wondered
whether
you
would
let
me
take
your
image
to
england
with
mine
and
whilst
they
were
together
have
them
examined
in
the
british
museum
and
see
if
any
possible
trace
of
opening
or
access
to
the
interior
of
them
is
to
be
found
of
course
i
shall
do
that
with
mine
when
i
get
there
anyhow
but
you
see
i
am
beginning
to
fall
in
line
with
your
superstition
i
feel
that
both
images
ought
to
be
treated
at
the
same
time
and
if
the
jewels
should
be
discovered
endacott
enquired
we
would
divide
equally
was
gregory
prompt
proposal
wu
ling
a
man
not
given
to
gestures
beat
the
air
in
front
of
him
gently
with
the
fingers
of
his
hands
we
would
not
agree
he
said
i
would
not
agree
endacott
would
not
agree
our
partner
who
is
not
here
would
not
agree
gregory
frowned
he
followed
wu
ling
steadfast
gaze
followed
it
into
the
further
recesses
of
the
second
warehouse
he
began
to
think
of
the
image
he
had
lost
the
image
in
the
steel
chamber
a
sense
of
its
beauty
suddenly
possessed
him
he
coveted
it
passionately
in
a
way
he
ventured
the
image
which
you
have
locked
up
there
the
image
which
you
call
the
soul
rather
belongs
to
me
do
you
think
i
have
at
least
a
claim
upon
it
i
fought
to
secure
it
my
friend
lost
his
life
in
defending
it
wu
ling
smile
was
almost
a
genuine
effort
at
mirth
endacott
chuckled
sardonically
if
i
were
you
young
man
he
advised
i
do
think
that
i
would
pursue
that
line
of
argument
it
was
stolen
property
gregory
persisted
doggedly
and
the
stolen
property
was
stolen
endacott
reminded
him
there
was
a
silence
an
impasse
seemed
to
have
been
reached
it
seemed
indeed
as
though
there
were
nothing
more
to
be
done
no
further
argument
he
could
use
yet
gregory
ballaston
sat
as
though
rooted
to
the
spot
to
leave
the
place
with
his
desire
unattained
seemed
almost
a
physical
impossibility
then
unexpectedly
wu
ling
spoke
at
some
length
what
you
come
here
to
say
he
began
has
reason
you
come
here
with
an
idea
which
is
right
body
and
soul
you
can
not
part
your
image
without
that
one
which
belongs
to
johnson
and
company
is
a
thing
of
evil
the
image
we
have
locked
in
our
treasure
chamber
is
a
thing
of
great
beauty
and
no
more
you
who
desire
the
jewels
can
not
buy
we
to
whom
the
jewels
mean
little
will
not
sell
listen
to
me
young
gentleman
i
propose
something
go
on
gregory
begged
eagerly
you
wu
ling
continued
have
a
quality
of
the
chinese
in
you
or
you
would
not
have
risked
life
for
this
adventure
you
are
gambler
me
too
i
offer
this
i
will
gamble
with
you
for
the
two
images
gregory
ballaston
held
his
cigarette
away
from
his
mouth
and
stared
at
the
speaker
temporarily
at
any
rate
his
nonchalance
had
left
him
are
you
in
earnest
he
demanded
wu
ling
nodded
gravely
gregory
glanced
towards
the
professor
the
latter
also
inclined
his
head
gently
if
wu
ling
says
so
he
murmured
gamble
but
how
what
games
do
we
both
know
there
is
a
chinese
game
wu
ling
began
not
having
any
gregory
interrupted
drily
i
have
heard
of
these
chinese
games
what
about
poker
not
understand
wu
ling
regretted
gregory
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
deep
in
disturbed
thought
more
than
anything
he
had
ever
coveted
in
the
world
he
coveted
that
other
image
look
here
he
decided
at
last
i
accept
but
we
do
need
to
play
a
game
at
all
send
for
a
pack
of
cards
have
them
well
shuffled
and
deal
a
card
to
each
of
us
the
highest
wins
wu
ling
nodded
approvingly
it
is
simple
he
assented
we
do
that
if
you
win
my
porters
shall
pack
image
and
you
can
take
it
to
ship
if
you
lose
you
bring
yours
here
gregory
moistened
his
lips
which
were
already
a
little
dry
it
is
agreed
he
said
wu
ling
opened
one
of
the
lower
drawers
of
his
desk
he
searched
for
a
few
moments
and
then
produced
an
ordinary
pack
of
playing
cards
he
laid
them
upon
the
table
in
here
gregory
demanded
glancing
at
the
silent
forms
always
moving
around
them
why
not
wu
ling
replied
what
we
do
is
nothing
to
them
they
see
nothing
they
work
endacott
chuckled
as
he
took
the
cards
in
his
hands
and
shuffled
them
you
will
lose
young
man
he
warned
gregory
i
seen
a
great
many
games
of
cards
in
this
city
but
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
european
who
could
hold
his
own
against
a
chinese
this
is
a
game
gregory
pointed
out
it
just
a
my
chance
must
be
as
good
as
his
we
make
it
the
best
of
three
though
how
wu
ling
queried
politely
a
card
each
three
times
his
partner
explained
and
the
one
who
wins
twice
out
of
three
times
gets
the
images
it
appears
to
me
that
i
too
am
rather
largely
interested
in
this
any
choice
as
to
who
turns
the
first
card
up
gregory
shook
his
head
cut
the
cards
which
were
handed
to
him
and
passed
them
to
wu
ling
the
latter
hesitated
only
for
the
fraction
of
a
second
then
he
threw
one
card
to
his
opponent
and
one
to
himself
gregory
card
was
a
knave
his
own
a
queen
one
up
to
the
firm
endacott
observed
gregory
took
the
cards
his
hands
were
beginning
to
shake
he
gave
his
opponent
a
four
he
himself
threw
down
a
ten
one
each
he
exclaimed
trying
his
best
to
keep
his
tone
level
he
shuffled
and
passed
the
cards
across
once
more
wu
ling
sat
for
a
moment
toying
with
them
almost
as
though
in
silent
prayer
then
he
threw
a
card
to
gregory
a
king
the
latter
cried
exultantly
and
the
firm
has
an
ace
endacott
pointed
out
as
wu
ling
card
fell
upon
the
table
gregory
sat
staring
at
it
motionless
and
rigid
the
light
of
triumph
fading
from
his
face
there
had
been
gamblers
in
his
family
though
and
heredity
asserted
itself
he
rose
calmly
to
his
feet
i
go
down
and
pack
the
image
he
said
wu
ling
clapped
his
hands
his
expression
had
never
varied
he
showed
no
signs
even
of
content
there
will
be
porters
who
attend
you
he
announced
they
will
follow
your
and
bring
back
the
image
gregory
held
out
his
hand
even
then
scarcely
realising
the
position
all
this
risk
and
privation
for
nothing
his
friend
life
for
nothing
all
gone
on
the
turn
of
a
card
for
a
moment
the
place
with
its
strange
atmosphere
seemed
unreal
his
adventure
a
nightmare
then
he
heard
wu
ling
giving
orders
to
the
foreman
and
saw
him
point
to
the
harbour
he
choked
down
his
feelings
i
shall
not
sympathise
with
you
endacott
said
as
he
shook
hands
your
enterprise
has
never
commended
itself
to
me
and
your
possession
of
the
body
without
the
soul
was
never
a
thing
to
be
envied
gregory
could
not
trust
himself
to
reply
he
held
out
his
hand
to
wu
ling
who
took
it
gravely
at
least
wu
ling
he
said
if
you
have
spoilt
my
trip
out
here
you
saved
my
life
i
do
think
it
worth
much
but
i
thank
you
send
the
porters
along
he
turned
and
left
the
place
a
tall
slim
figure
graceful
and
trim
in
his
clothes
the
strangest
contrast
to
the
coolies
and
one
or
two
native
traders
through
whom
he
had
almost
to
push
his
way
he
walked
out
into
the
broiling
sun
and
disappeared
endacott
glanced
at
wu
ling
and
wu
ling
with
the
cards
in
his
hand
smiled
back
at
him
the
morning
wore
on
the
afternoon
came
and
passed
endacott
who
had
spent
a
pleasant
few
hours
with
his
chinese
friend
returned
to
find
repose
reigning
throughout
the
rambling
premises
of
johnson
and
company
a
fierce
sun
had
suddenly
blazed
once
more
through
the
drifting
masses
of
mist
gone
now
as
breath
from
a
the
water
in
the
harbour
was
indigo
blue
the
junks
and
dhows
and
native
fishing
craft
were
all
becalmed
like
painted
ships
upon
a
still
ocean
the
sirens
blew
no
more
all
who
could
were
at
rest
the
porters
in
the
warehouse
had
crept
into
the
dark
shady
corners
and
lay
there
motionless
half
a
dozen
clerks
young
men
of
superior
station
who
wore
european
clothes
and
babbled
a
little
english
had
retired
to
the
shelter
of
an
adjoining
tea
house
only
wu
ling
sat
still
in
his
place
waiting
endacott
took
in
the
situation
at
a
glance
they
have
not
returned
our
porters
he
enquired
not
yet
and
the
ship
sails
it
is
past
due
endacott
smiled
the
truth
is
as
old
as
life
he
said
the
things
which
are
written
here
are
written
behind
the
veil
that
young
man
came
from
what
from
a
western
point
of
view
we
used
to
think
good
stock
his
father
was
under
me
at
oxford
his
grandfather
and
generations
before
him
were
men
of
good
repute
still
that
counts
for
nothing
and
we
know
why
he
has
the
body
why
wait
wu
ling
you
think
that
his
word
it
is
broken
the
latter
asked
broken
to
us
who
scorned
even
to
watch
him
to
the
ship
endacott
shook
his
head
he
has
the
body
he
repeated
there
was
a
pattering
of
feet
outside
feet
that
passed
swiftly
across
the
pavement
of
blistered
heat
a
little
troop
of
porters
entered
and
sought
shelter
the
foreman
advanced
and
stood
silent
before
wu
desk
speak
wu
ling
directed
we
waited
on
the
dock
the
man
recounted
we
waited
in
the
heat
hours
went
by
then
as
the
ship
moved
away
the
englishman
leaned
over
the
rail
he
called
out
to
us
is
nothing
to
send
back
then
he
disappeared
so
you
returned
wu
ling
murmured
so
we
returned
the
man
assented
wu
ling
rose
to
his
feet
and
stood
at
the
window
there
was
a
clamour
of
sirens
blowing
through
the
sultry
stagnant
air
a
waving
of
handkerchiefs
from
a
distant
dock
a
great
steamer
was
drifting
out
her
bows
set
westward
wu
ling
watched
her
gathering
speed
through
the
lazy
sea
leaving
behind
her
a
wake
like
a
rope
of
snow
in
the
deep
blue
of
the
waters
which
she
parted
the
smoke
belched
from
her
funnels
somewhere
on
board
her
was
gregory
ballaston
and
his
booty
endacott
laid
his
hand
upon
the
arm
of
wu
ling
whom
he
loved
the
young
man
has
done
ill
he
said
but
the
soul
is
ours
chapter
v
steward
gregory
asked
him
standing
up
in
the
centre
of
his
stateroom
his
hands
behind
his
back
do
i
look
drunk
the
steward
was
used
to
eccentric
passengers
and
answered
as
though
the
question
were
an
entirely
reasonable
one
for
a
young
gentleman
as
has
moved
out
of
his
stateroom
for
two
days
and
had
a
good
deal
more
to
drink
than
to
eat
he
pronounced
you
look
wonderful
sir
fetch
me
a
whisky
and
soda
then
certainly
sir
the
man
withdrew
closing
the
door
behind
him
gregory
drew
back
the
curtain
of
his
upper
bunk
and
again
with
tireless
eyes
he
stared
at
the
treasure
which
had
cost
him
his
friend
life
and
as
it
seemed
to
him
sometimes
now
especially
in
those
horrible
watches
of
the
night
his
own
honour
always
there
was
the
same
fascination
every
time
he
looked
he
fancied
that
he
discovered
some
fresh
horror
in
that
grim
yet
superbly
bestial
face
you
are
ugly
he
said
softly
as
he
dropped
the
curtain
you
are
damnably
ugly
i
wish
you
were
at
the
bottom
of
the
sea
and
yet
i
part
with
you
the
steward
brought
him
the
whisky
and
soda
he
paused
for
a
moment
before
drinking
it
what
your
name
he
demanded
perkins
sir
well
then
perkins
he
directed
please
see
the
second
steward
for
me
try
to
get
me
a
small
table
in
the
saloon
alone
in
a
corner
and
i
will
go
in
to
dinner
very
good
sir
the
man
replied
as
he
made
his
exit
there
will
be
plenty
of
room
to
sit
just
where
you
please
until
we
get
to
bombay
once
more
gregory
pushed
aside
the
curtain
raised
his
glass
and
drained
its
contents
his
eyes
fixed
all
the
time
upon
the
image
he
set
down
the
empty
tumbler
that
what
you
like
to
see
me
drink
is
it
he
murmured
softly
you
like
the
whole
world
to
be
as
foul
as
the
things
some
devil
has
carved
into
your
face
yet
i
suppose
i
would
forgive
you
if
only
you
would
give
up
your
secret
for
the
hundredth
time
he
passed
his
fingers
over
the
carved
head
fingers
which
were
long
and
slim
and
sensitive
of
touch
nowhere
however
could
they
discover
the
slightest
sign
of
any
join
or
any
possible
aperture
however
cunningly
concealed
the
wood
had
become
as
smooth
and
hard
as
marble
black
as
jet
shining
as
though
with
generations
of
polish
gregory
drew
the
curtain
and
turned
away
baffled
once
more
with
his
back
turned
to
the
image
he
made
a
long
and
deliberate
toilet
afterwards
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
boarded
the
steamer
ventured
on
deck
to
find
only
a
few
people
promenading
a
dozen
or
so
drinking
cocktails
in
the
smoking
room
there
was
no
sign
of
the
person
he
longed
yet
dreaded
to
see
the
heat
was
great
but
it
was
not
unusually
oppressive
in
the
west
a
sun
pencils
of
black
cloud
surrounding
it
seemed
almost
to
be
falling
into
the
ocean
gregory
loitered
about
until
long
after
the
bugle
had
sounded
and
then
summoning
up
all
his
courage
descended
to
take
his
place
in
the
saloon
the
second
steward
hurried
forward
to
meet
him
and
showed
him
his
table
he
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
realised
its
isolation
i
have
given
you
a
table
to
yourself
sir
as
perkins
seemed
to
think
you
wanted
it
he
announced
but
if
you
would
care
for
a
seat
at
the
captain
table
that
was
where
we
had
intended
to
put
you
it
could
be
arranged
now
if
you
preferred
it
not
on
any
account
gregory
begged
earnestly
i
been
laid
up
must
be
quiet
this
exactly
suits
me
he
continued
a
conversation
for
some
minutes
accepted
the
wine
list
studied
the
menu
gave
his
orders
and
finally
ventured
to
look
around
she
was
there
seated
on
the
right
hand
of
the
captain
her
inevitable
place
under
the
circumstances
their
eyes
met
without
hesitation
she
smiled
a
greeting
gregory
half
rose
in
his
place
and
bowed
when
he
sat
down
he
realised
that
both
his
hands
were
clenched
the
white
of
the
knuckles
showing
through
the
skin
his
breath
was
coming
a
little
quickly
it
was
an
absurd
thing
but
he
had
a
feeling
that
he
had
passed
through
one
of
the
crises
of
his
life
there
had
been
no
message
then
from
her
uncle
no
wireless
she
knew
nothing
afterwards
he
came
across
her
on
deck
talking
to
an
elderly
woman
whom
he
realised
must
be
the
hichens
of
whom
she
had
spoken
as
a
possible
chaperone
she
turned
round
at
once
and
welcomed
him
smilingly
there
was
a
shade
of
reproach
in
her
tone
i
was
beginning
to
wonder
what
had
become
of
you
ballaston
she
said
let
me
present
you
to
my
chaperone
mrs
hichens
gregory
acknowledged
the
introduction
and
spent
the
next
few
minutes
searching
for
and
arranging
their
chairs
i
suppose
i
have
been
outrageously
lazy
he
confessed
when
at
last
he
had
installed
them
that
trip
of
mine
into
the
interior
which
you
heard
me
speaking
of
with
your
uncle
was
rather
an
exhausting
affair
some
day
you
must
tell
me
the
whole
story
she
begged
the
snatches
i
heard
of
it
were
most
romantic
you
came
back
in
wu
ling
trading
schooner
did
you
wu
ling
gregory
confided
saved
my
life
and
brought
me
back
to
the
city
i
got
into
trouble
i
was
certainly
somewhere
where
i
had
no
right
to
be
and
i
was
handed
over
to
wu
abst
the
famous
pirate
by
a
couple
of
fanatical
priests
with
instructions
that
i
was
to
become
nourishment
for
the
alligators
wu
ling
heard
about
it
at
one
of
the
villages
where
he
was
trading
and
released
me
it
sounds
like
a
page
from
novel
does
it
it
was
all
very
real
at
the
time
though
they
both
looked
at
him
curiously
but
the
older
woman
had
lived
for
some
time
in
a
country
where
few
questions
were
asked
and
claire
was
more
concerned
with
the
shadow
of
either
pain
or
sleeplessness
which
seemed
to
darken
his
face
i
can
quite
understand
your
feeling
like
a
rest
she
said
sympathetically
i
thought
you
looked
terribly
ill
the
day
we
met
in
the
warehouse
she
picked
up
a
book
merely
with
the
idea
of
giving
him
an
opportunity
to
pass
on
if
he
cared
to
but
after
strolling
about
the
deck
aimlessly
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
he
returned
to
find
her
with
her
book
still
unopened
her
mind
as
a
matter
of
fact
occupied
with
him
and
his
story
she
accepted
immediately
his
invitation
to
walk
they
went
on
to
the
upper
deck
and
looked
down
together
at
the
oily
water
with
its
streak
of
phosphorescence
they
talked
of
the
ship
of
such
of
their
fellow
passengers
as
they
had
observed
and
of
the
route
home
with
a
certain
obvious
attempt
at
casualness
conversation
of
little
import
yet
almost
a
necessary
to
more
intimate
understanding
claire
perceptions
were
keen
enough
for
her
to
realise
that
this
young
man
was
scarcely
in
a
normal
condition
you
have
had
no
wireless
from
your
uncle
or
from
the
firm
since
you
left
he
asked
a
little
abruptly
she
shook
her
head
you
asked
me
that
before
she
reminded
him
why
on
earth
should
i
we
said
early
in
the
morning
after
the
night
you
dined
with
us
uncle
would
never
dream
of
coming
to
see
me
off
he
hates
steamers
and
he
hates
what
he
calls
westwards
how
he
will
survive
life
in
england
i
am
sure
i
ca
imagine
except
that
he
does
sometimes
still
admit
that
english
country
life
is
wonderful
he
really
means
to
come
then
why
surely
and
you
shall
you
like
it
she
assented
a
little
doubtfully
i
think
i
would
rather
live
in
new
york
she
confessed
but
i
fancy
uncle
there
i
think
that
would
be
expecting
a
little
too
much
of
him
he
still
has
friends
and
a
few
relatives
in
england
pretty
sporting
of
him
to
break
away
at
all
gregory
observed
after
all
these
years
i
think
it
is
marvellous
she
agreed
i
am
sure
if
i
had
come
he
rather
go
on
living
in
that
strange
smelly
little
house
of
his
and
read
chinese
manuscripts
and
interpret
chinese
hieroglyphics
round
old
ornaments
and
talk
chinese
literature
with
some
of
the
people
you
ever
saw
up
at
the
university
than
do
anything
else
in
the
world
all
the
same
gregory
remarked
they
say
that
a
man
should
always
return
to
the
country
of
his
birth
to
end
his
days
besides
china
is
no
place
for
an
englishman
after
a
certain
number
of
years
he
become
nothing
but
an
old
fossil
without
the
society
of
his
own
kind
what
a
nice
consoling
person
you
are
she
declared
sometimes
had
it
on
my
conscience
a
little
that
i
taking
him
away
from
the
things
he
likes
best
in
life
i
should
worry
about
that
he
told
her
he
be
better
at
home
amongst
some
of
his
old
cronies
and
for
you
well
of
course
china
would
be
utterly
impossible
i
am
very
happy
to
be
going
to
england
she
assured
him
i
am
looking
forward
to
the
country
life
immensely
fond
of
games
he
asked
her
riding
and
tennis
are
the
extent
of
my
accomplishments
she
replied
i
like
those
and
then
after
a
year
or
so
i
shall
hope
to
travel
on
the
continent
my
aunt
still
has
a
great
many
friends
in
paris
one
meets
so
many
american
women
and
girls
in
france
and
italy
he
observed
and
so
few
men
why
are
they
such
stay
at
homes
they
are
she
explained
they
travel
but
they
want
something
out
of
it
they
either
prospect
for
mines
or
look
for
markets
or
something
of
that
sort
in
a
way
then
they
too
have
the
adventurer
instinct
i
have
any
head
for
business
when
the
war
ended
i
had
been
wounded
twice
and
transferred
into
the
intelligence
department
it
chanced
that
i
was
in
palestine
and
i
went
on
from
there
to
abyssinia
from
there
i
visited
some
friends
in
bombay
and
when
i
got
home
my
father
and
i
planned
my
little
adventure
in
china
you
certainly
are
some
traveller
she
admitted
smilingly
so
was
my
father
before
me
he
confided
he
was
in
the
diplomatic
service
for
some
time
and
lived
in
pekin
during
the
days
of
the
monarchy
she
suddenly
looked
around
and
saw
the
rising
moon
a
circle
emerging
with
incredible
swiftness
from
the
edge
of
a
black
sea
she
crossed
the
deck
swiftly
waving
to
him
to
follow
her
halfway
there
he
paused
she
was
standing
full
in
the
light
shining
through
the
uncurtained
window
of
the
marconi
room
tall
slim
and
white
in
the
windless
night
a
curiously
and
wonderfully
desirable
vision
she
turned
and
waved
to
him
impatiently
a
smile
of
invitation
upon
her
lips
her
eyes
full
of
eager
delight
hurry
she
cried
is
it
wonderful
he
came
slowly
across
the
deck
and
a
little
puzzled
frown
took
the
place
of
her
smile
as
he
drew
near
why
do
you
look
at
me
as
though
you
had
never
seen
me
before
she
asked
as
he
took
his
place
by
her
side
i
never
have
with
the
same
eyes
he
answered
uneasily
idiot
she
laughed
well
you
have
to
put
up
with
me
for
at
least
six
weeks
like
this
do
you
love
the
stillness
with
just
the
throb
of
the
engine
i
like
it
better
without
the
engine
he
observed
it
is
beautiful
enough
here
to
make
one
believe
that
we
are
on
our
way
to
paradise
and
that
wretched
throb
keeps
on
reminding
us
that
our
next
stop
is
bombay
are
you
just
a
little
inclined
to
be
cynical
she
asked
i
do
know
quite
what
the
matter
with
me
he
answered
restlessly
i
think
that
terrible
country
behind
has
broken
my
nerve
or
his
thoughts
flashed
back
to
his
stateroom
she
was
suddenly
intent
upon
listening
from
away
upon
the
lower
deck
they
could
hear
the
sound
of
the
orchestra
her
face
lit
up
with
pure
joy
dancing
she
cried
i
believe
they
dancing
why
i
have
even
heard
the
music
since
i
left
new
york
come
along
she
had
reached
the
companion
ladder
before
he
could
catch
her
up
already
her
feet
were
moving
to
the
music
look
here
he
confided
doubtfully
remember
i
been
out
of
england
for
a
very
long
time
i
not
at
all
sure
that
i
can
manage
these
new
steps
she
slipped
her
arm
through
his
in
friendly
fashion
you
the
only
man
on
board
i
know
and
you
got
to
she
declared
imperiously
chapter
vi
perkins
gregory
demanded
as
he
struggled
into
his
dinner
coat
a
few
nights
later
what
should
you
think
if
i
told
you
to
drop
that
grinning
piece
of
wooden
monstrosity
there
into
the
sea
the
steward
glanced
doubtfully
over
his
shoulder
at
the
image
it
a
damned
ugly
piece
of
goods
sir
he
admitted
but
i
make
away
with
it
like
that
it
very
likely
valuable
they
give
no
end
of
money
sometimes
for
genuine
bits
of
stuff
from
china
way
gregory
straightened
his
tie
and
looked
at
his
treasure
fixedly
perkins
he
confided
that
image
is
either
worth
a
few
hundred
or
perhaps
a
thousand
pounds
as
an
antique
or
it
may
be
worth
listen
to
me
a
million
the
steward
coughed
he
was
inclined
to
think
that
this
passenger
of
his
on
whom
the
slackness
of
the
season
had
enabled
him
to
bestow
more
than
his
normal
share
of
attention
was
a
trifle
cracked
if
it
is
worth
as
much
money
as
that
sir
he
remarked
it
would
be
a
sin
to
think
of
getting
rid
of
it
you
quite
right
gregory
assented
it
would
be
a
sin
we
let
it
stay
where
it
is
at
his
table
in
the
dining
saloon
he
trifled
with
his
dinner
and
covertly
watched
the
girl
seated
by
the
captain
side
who
on
his
entrance
had
sent
him
a
little
wave
of
welcome
he
had
worshipped
more
or
less
casually
at
the
shrine
of
girls
and
women
of
all
ages
but
never
with
quite
the
same
restless
and
fitful
confusion
of
feeling
as
had
swept
over
him
occasionally
during
the
last
few
days
in
her
near
presence
or
at
the
thought
of
her
in
his
sleepless
hours
she
was
he
tried
to
tell
himself
as
he
studied
her
with
eyes
that
attempted
to
be
critical
an
ordinary
attractive
girl
like
hundreds
of
others
of
her
age
too
young
and
too
lacking
in
experience
to
justify
a
great
passion
her
yellow
hair
her
one
real
beauty
was
brushed
backwards
with
a
touch
almost
of
severity
a
fashion
however
which
the
vivacity
of
her
face
justified
her
eyes
he
had
to
admit
were
unusual
grave
and
tender
sometimes
full
of
the
sparkle
of
humour
when
as
now
she
was
engaged
in
conversation
her
mouth
was
perhaps
almost
too
sensitive
but
it
was
beautifully
shaped
and
not
he
watched
her
rise
and
walk
out
of
the
saloon
a
girl
figure
still
but
with
just
a
suggestion
of
coming
power
in
her
easy
flowing
movements
he
had
known
more
beautiful
women
there
were
more
beautiful
women
to
be
seen
every
day
in
bond
street
he
told
himself
with
an
almost
fierce
desire
to
deny
her
attractiveness
but
she
possessed
a
gift
which
baffled
him
he
only
knew
that
the
idea
of
that
message
which
without
a
doubt
she
must
at
some
time
or
other
receive
from
her
uncle
was
like
a
nightmare
to
him
he
felt
instinctively
how
meanness
of
any
sort
dishonour
and
falsehood
would
appeal
to
her
with
her
youthful
uncompromising
standards
her
lack
of
experience
she
would
belie
that
sensitive
mouth
and
the
kindliness
of
her
eyes
where
an
older
woman
might
have
sympathised
she
would
have
no
pity
and
with
it
all
his
mind
was
in
a
state
of
turmoil
about
her
unaccustomed
sensations
tortured
him
the
flash
of
her
welcoming
glance
had
set
his
pulses
tingling
he
finished
his
wine
leaving
most
of
his
dinner
untasted
and
instead
of
going
on
deck
returned
to
his
stateroom
thrust
aside
the
curtain
and
looked
fiercely
almost
challengingly
at
his
treasure
as
he
looked
he
felt
once
more
a
certain
change
in
himself
and
his
impulses
suddenly
felt
the
torture
of
a
sacrilegious
thought
an
instinct
horrible
at
one
moment
alluring
the
next
he
suddenly
threw
the
cigarette
case
which
he
was
holding
at
the
face
which
mocked
him
blast
you
he
cried
the
case
truly
enough
thrown
recoiled
from
the
unchanging
hardness
of
that
lowering
forehead
and
fell
spilling
its
contents
upon
the
bunk
he
recovered
it
with
trembling
fingers
listening
all
the
time
to
the
music
of
the
distant
orchestra
he
had
a
sudden
impulse
to
lock
the
door
and
stay
where
he
was
an
impulse
swept
away
a
moment
later
by
an
unconquerable
desire
to
be
moving
to
the
music
with
claire
in
his
arms
from
the
door
he
ventured
upon
one
last
unwilling
glance
upwards
he
could
have
sworn
that
for
the
fiftieth
time
that
expression
had
changed
there
was
a
light
almost
of
suggestion
in
those
sightless
orbs
a
curl
of
sardonic
contempt
in
the
thick
lips
he
hurried
up
on
to
the
deck
and
leaned
for
a
moment
over
the
rail
his
eyes
looking
across
the
sea
nerves
he
told
himself
slowly
nerves
the
doctor
passed
him
with
a
cheery
good
evening
gregory
called
out
to
him
just
a
moment
doctor
you
be
in
disgrace
the
latter
remarked
they
dancing
already
come
and
have
a
liqueur
in
my
room
first
thank
you
gregory
replied
they
made
their
way
to
the
lower
deck
and
into
the
doctor
quarters
the
latter
excused
himself
for
a
moment
whilst
he
prepared
some
medicine
afterwards
he
opened
his
cupboard
produced
a
bottle
of
brandy
and
two
liqueur
glasses
and
pushed
a
box
of
cigarettes
across
the
table
what
wrong
with
you
young
fellow
he
asked
a
little
abruptly
nerves
gregory
answered
do
you
believe
in
them
to
some
extent
was
the
cautious
reply
how
are
they
getting
at
you
i
haunted
by
an
evil
spirit
gregory
declared
lighting
a
cigarette
it
there
a
wooden
image
behind
a
curtain
down
in
my
stateroom
now
get
ready
to
laugh
i
assure
you
doctor
every
moment
i
spend
with
that
damned
thing
makes
me
feel
more
of
a
rotter
where
did
you
get
it
the
doctor
enquired
curiously
gregory
glanced
towards
the
closed
door
i
am
not
sure
whether
it
is
wise
to
tell
you
he
replied
but
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
small
statue
of
a
famous
chinese
god
it
is
meant
to
represent
all
the
gross
side
of
a
man
life
it
is
meant
to
depict
every
evil
that
can
haunt
the
sinner
the
doctor
suddenly
leaned
forward
in
his
chair
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
were
mixed
up
in
the
nilkaya
affair
he
exclaimed
you
not
one
of
the
englishmen
who
looted
the
place
i
got
one
of
the
images
here
anyway
gregory
admitted
there
was
a
report
that
you
were
both
dead
my
pal
is
although
he
was
taking
on
what
we
thought
the
simplest
part
of
the
job
they
got
me
a
dozen
of
those
priests
fought
like
furies
the
fellows
did
i
was
to
have
been
food
for
the
alligators
but
i
was
rescued
on
the
river
by
a
trader
from
the
coast
the
doctor
looked
at
his
companion
with
amazement
no
wonder
you
got
nerves
he
observed
you
been
through
something
i
been
through
hell
gregory
admitted
the
fight
was
so
bad
but
i
was
two
days
strapped
up
on
that
pirate
ship
with
not
a
mouthful
to
eat
in
a
foul
atmosphere
and
expecting
to
be
thrown
overboard
at
any
moment
i
had
a
certain
amount
of
luck
i
got
clear
as
you
see
and
i
got
one
of
the
images
it
is
supposed
to
be
chock
full
of
jewels
and
yet
i
half
inclined
to
chuck
the
damned
thing
overboard
the
doctor
smiled
reassuringly
i
wo
say
anything
of
the
morality
of
the
enterprise
he
declared
but
you
had
a
fine
plucky
adventure
and
when
you
talk
about
throwing
the
image
overboard
you
talking
like
an
ass
set
your
heel
upon
all
this
superstitious
nonsense
ballaston
and
go
on
as
usual
believe
me
you
be
none
the
worse
for
possessing
that
piece
of
wood
you
create
the
evil
in
yourself
when
you
allow
yourself
to
believe
that
the
likely
to
do
you
harm
the
world
old
enough
for
us
to
realise
the
nature
of
most
of
its
organic
forces
the
malice
of
nine
hundred
years
ago
may
have
been
carved
into
that
image
but
it
ca
come
out
again
gregory
drew
a
little
sigh
of
relief
of
course
you
right
he
acquiesced
and
yet
cut
out
the
yets
the
doctor
interrupted
get
up
on
deck
now
and
dance
that
what
good
for
you
be
normal
and
do
harbour
any
thought
that
has
a
definite
and
reasonable
origin
see
you
later
i
may
come
up
and
have
a
turn
myself
gregory
hurried
on
deck
to
be
greeted
a
little
reproachfully
by
claire
how
dare
you
keep
me
waiting
she
complained
the
orchestra
have
never
played
better
and
i
been
nearly
crazy
sitting
here
by
myself
do
let
waste
a
minute
now
you
have
come
they
were
out
of
the
region
of
storms
the
awning
had
been
rolled
away
and
they
danced
on
the
outside
deck
with
the
orchestra
half
concealed
in
a
little
lounge
the
minutes
passed
by
in
a
sort
of
enchantment
from
fox
trots
they
passed
to
waltzes
both
utterly
unconscious
that
sometimes
they
were
the
only
two
dancing
suddenly
claire
drew
back
and
looked
at
her
companion
why
i
believe
you
tired
she
exclaimed
do
let
stop
no
we
go
on
he
answered
quickly
the
music
seemed
to
have
gained
a
new
and
more
passionate
throb
the
starlit
night
seemed
to
be
leaning
down
to
close
them
in
there
was
a
breath
of
magic
in
the
languid
air
in
the
perfume
from
her
hair
and
clothes
swimming
out
into
the
stillness
her
eyes
for
a
moment
had
half
closed
in
faint
response
to
the
joy
of
it
all
his
arm
suddenly
tightened
around
her
tightened
stop
she
ordered
quickly
he
obeyed
at
once
she
looked
at
him
with
an
expression
of
amazement
in
which
was
almost
a
gleam
of
terror
then
she
turned
away
i
tired
she
said
i
want
to
speak
to
hichens
please
come
he
knew
better
than
to
follow
her
to
protest
to
attempt
any
explanation
he
made
his
way
to
the
smoking
room
and
drank
two
whiskies
and
sodas
the
steward
looked
at
him
curiously
hot
work
dancing
sir
he
observed
hot
as
hell
gregory
answered
give
me
another
drink
he
was
served
immediately
afterwards
he
stepped
back
on
to
the
deck
claire
had
disappeared
he
went
up
to
a
woman
whom
he
had
previously
avoided
with
sedulous
care
a
grass
widow
still
in
a
way
but
overanxious
overobvious
overperfumed
she
rose
to
her
feet
with
astonishing
alacrity
at
his
unexpected
invitation
a
moment
later
they
danced
off
into
the
darkness
the
steward
took
gregory
to
his
stateroom
that
night
and
the
faithful
perkins
summoned
from
his
own
repose
undressed
him
he
went
to
sleep
with
a
chuckle
upon
his
distorted
lips
i
with
you
old
fellow
he
muttered
waving
his
hand
feebly
to
his
unseen
companion
you
the
chap
for
us
ballastons
glad
i
got
you
and
not
the
other
chapter
vii
the
doctor
a
few
days
later
paused
in
his
morning
promenade
and
took
a
vacant
place
by
claire
side
he
made
a
few
commonplace
remarks
about
the
voyage
and
then
leaned
confidentially
towards
her
miss
endacott
i
want
to
speak
to
you
for
a
moment
if
i
may
about
young
ballaston
the
sensitive
lips
quivered
a
little
nevertheless
she
had
well
doctor
i
do
exactly
know
what
has
happened
of
course
he
went
on
but
you
two
were
such
pals
at
first
and
now
one
ca
help
noticing
that
you
scarcely
speak
ballaston
has
said
a
word
to
me
this
is
all
on
my
own
but
i
imagine
that
somehow
or
other
he
has
succeeded
in
offending
you
he
has
she
acquiesced
coldly
i
do
hold
any
brief
for
the
young
man
the
doctor
proceeded
but
i
ca
help
wondering
whether
you
know
what
he
been
through
just
lately
he
had
a
wonderful
adventure
and
played
his
part
like
a
man
i
wo
say
a
word
about
the
morality
of
it
or
the
object
of
it
or
anything
else
i
only
say
that
it
was
a
jolly
plucky
thing
to
attempt
and
he
only
escaped
with
his
life
by
a
miracle
i
have
heard
all
this
claire
admitted
it
is
always
after
an
exploit
of
this
sort
that
one
runs
a
danger
of
suffering
from
nerves
that
precisely
what
happened
to
young
ballaston
in
his
stateroom
down
below
he
has
that
image
which
he
risked
his
life
for
and
he
adopted
the
legend
about
it
in
a
way
i
should
never
have
dreamed
a
young
fellow
with
his
strength
of
character
could
have
done
you
know
the
legend
i
have
heard
it
well
ballaston
honestly
believes
that
every
hour
he
spends
with
this
image
is
doing
him
harm
morally
and
that
very
belief
is
apt
to
make
him
behave
at
odd
times
impossibly
the
thing
wo
last
of
course
get
used
to
it
and
the
idea
will
pass
out
of
his
brain
it
is
there
just
now
and
i
tell
you
frankly
that
i
believe
it
is
likely
to
influence
his
actions
there
was
more
and
more
interest
in
claire
face
a
little
tinge
of
returning
colour
she
leaned
forward
the
icy
note
had
gone
from
her
tone
how
extraordinary
she
exclaimed
i
well
to
tell
you
the
truth
doctor
the
other
night
when
we
were
dancing
when
i
was
offended
i
thought
that
he
had
had
too
much
to
drink
the
doctor
shook
his
head
it
was
that
at
all
he
assured
her
gravely
now
mind
you
miss
endacott
i
not
defending
ballaston
i
do
even
know
what
the
cause
of
offence
was
certainly
i
not
trying
to
interfere
in
any
way
but
he
is
suffering
and
suffering
terribly
and
it
is
doing
him
any
good
to
be
cut
off
from
you
if
you
could
just
remember
that
you
might
be
able
to
help
him
perhaps
more
than
any
one
else
i
will
remember
she
promised
thank
you
very
much
indeed
the
doctor
took
his
leave
and
claire
sat
gazing
out
to
sea
with
a
kindlier
expression
in
her
face
a
few
minutes
later
gregory
left
the
smoking
room
and
seeing
her
was
turning
the
other
way
she
called
to
him
softly
mr
ballaston
he
glanced
around
in
surprise
ballaston
please
come
here
for
a
moment
he
approached
slowly
and
stood
before
her
bareheaded
as
she
looked
at
him
her
pity
increased
his
eyes
were
very
brilliant
but
they
seemed
to
have
sunken
and
he
was
certainly
thinner
in
the
face
will
you
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
for
a
little
time
please
she
invited
if
you
wish
me
to
he
replied
diffidently
i
think
that
perhaps
i
was
silly
about
the
other
night
she
went
on
i
perhaps
misunderstood
you
did
he
groaned
please
do
say
that
she
begged
i
want
to
believe
that
i
did
and
i
want
you
to
please
be
nice
to
me
again
and
be
different
has
any
one
been
talking
to
you
he
asked
the
doctor
spoke
a
few
words
she
admitted
it
is
sweet
of
you
he
declared
dejectedly
but
you
must
believe
the
doctor
altogether
it
is
exactly
nerves
i
was
never
much
good
and
you
such
a
child
i
not
good
enough
now
to
talk
and
dance
with
you
on
equal
terms
i
feel
this
all
the
time
for
two
days
i
have
hated
you
because
it
is
through
you
i
know
what
i
am
and
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
i
hate
you
he
went
on
because
because
she
questioned
because
i
care
for
you
more
than
any
one
else
in
the
world
he
concluded
she
laughed
but
very
kindly
her
eyes
were
softer
than
he
had
ever
seen
them
and
there
was
a
new
flush
in
her
cheeks
it
is
just
as
silly
for
you
to
say
that
as
the
other
she
declared
considering
that
i
have
known
you
exactly
what
is
it
eleven
twelve
days
now
could
we
talk
nonsense
please
or
go
for
a
walk
we
start
again
and
you
see
i
trust
you
i
should
he
warned
her
gloomily
i
not
trustworthy
and
find
it
out
before
long
i
wait
until
i
do
she
decided
come
along
this
morning
i
need
movement
it
is
nearly
so
hot
and
there
has
been
any
one
to
do
things
with
the
last
few
days
we
play
deck
tennis
on
the
upper
deck
and
then
go
for
a
swim
they
passed
the
whole
morning
together
the
doctor
seeing
them
waved
his
hand
cordially
the
captain
stopped
and
exchanged
a
few
words
everything
seemed
to
be
once
more
as
it
should
be
gregory
was
quite
as
distinctly
the
and
most
attractive
young
man
on
board
as
claire
was
the
most
charming
girl
and
nearly
every
one
seemed
pleased
that
the
little
misunderstanding
which
had
kept
them
apart
was
apparently
removed
gossip
not
but
natural
enough
recommenced
gregory
heir
to
a
baronetcy
poor
perhaps
but
with
a
romantic
career
for
a
young
man
and
claire
whose
uncle
was
a
partner
in
the
great
firm
of
johnson
and
company
a
most
suitable
affair
late
in
the
afternoon
they
found
a
cool
corner
in
the
bows
and
gregory
read
poetry
his
voice
naturally
a
beautiful
one
with
its
slight
oxford
peculiarities
fascinated
claire
she
listened
with
joy
as
he
passed
from
shelley
to
keats
and
wound
up
with
swinburne
afterwards
the
captain
took
them
into
his
room
for
tea
and
they
sat
talking
until
it
was
almost
time
to
change
they
descended
from
the
bridge
together
claire
exclaimed
happily
we
dance
gregory
made
no
reply
for
a
single
moment
a
little
shiver
seemed
to
pass
through
him
she
turned
and
smiled
reassuringly
i
am
looking
forward
to
it
so
much
she
murmured
i
sure
we
are
both
going
to
love
it
the
doctor
swung
by
as
gregory
was
changing
for
dinner
gregory
hailed
him
just
one
moment
he
called
out
the
doctor
paused
and
put
his
head
in
the
stateroom
a
large
one
on
the
upper
promenade
deck
and
easily
accessible
i
want
to
thank
you
gregory
said
earnestly
for
speaking
to
miss
endacott
everything
all
right
again
the
other
asked
smiling
quite
thanks
to
you
was
the
reply
i
hope
to
god
i
do
give
myself
away
again
come
in
and
have
a
look
at
my
evil
genius
the
doctor
came
a
little
farther
into
the
room
and
examined
the
image
through
his
eyeglasses
jove
it
amazing
he
exclaimed
amazingly
powerful
diabolically
gregory
muttered
the
doctor
was
clearly
fascinated
by
the
image
his
fingers
passed
over
it
with
the
soft
touch
of
a
connoisseur
he
stood
back
and
viewed
it
from
another
angle
ballaston
he
said
there
is
a
sculptor
in
the
west
who
could
produce
a
piece
of
work
like
that
it
stupendous
i
think
i
shall
tell
my
steward
to
send
it
down
below
into
safe
keeping
somewhere
gregory
suggested
turning
away
and
lighting
a
cigarette
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
good
idea
the
doctor
shook
his
head
i
think
it
would
be
a
damned
bad
idea
he
answered
now
look
here
young
fellow
he
went
on
putting
his
hand
on
gregory
shoulder
how
old
are
you
if
at
your
time
of
life
the
doctor
continued
you
once
begin
to
give
way
to
what
your
brain
and
real
consciousness
tell
you
is
an
idea
you
be
a
victim
to
what
they
call
all
your
life
never
been
affected
before
like
this
have
you
never
gregory
declared
earnestly
one
does
want
to
talk
about
oneself
but
i
got
my
medals
in
france
and
a
jolly
close
shave
of
the
big
thing
i
shot
big
game
and
i
come
out
of
tight
corners
once
or
twice
without
turning
a
hair
that
why
i
do
understand
this
good
the
doctor
exclaimed
that
confirms
me
in
what
i
was
saying
square
up
to
it
man
do
be
all
the
time
flinching
away
like
you
are
now
look
at
it
look
at
it
with
me
arm
in
arm
it
is
just
a
damned
but
wonderful
representation
of
wickedness
there
is
nothing
alive
about
it
except
its
art
it
is
going
to
do
you
any
harm
and
it
is
going
to
do
me
any
harm
let
it
stay
where
it
is
ballaston
fastened
his
tie
slowly
considering
the
advice
thoughtfully
you
mean
that
doctor
he
demanded
you
see
when
i
sane
i
have
the
utmost
respect
and
i
can
say
it
to
you
affection
for
miss
endacott
she
only
a
child
of
course
but
she
wonderful
it
such
a
horrible
thought
that
i
might
chuck
it
the
doctor
interrupted
tersely
you
wo
remember
if
you
give
way
now
you
will
give
way
all
your
life
come
in
and
have
a
last
drink
with
me
before
you
turn
in
and
i
bet
you
be
jolly
glad
you
stuck
it
i
must
get
along
now
got
a
patient
expecting
me
before
dinner
he
swung
off
large
buoyant
diffusing
an
atmosphere
of
confidence
gregory
finished
his
dressing
strolled
along
the
deck
and
found
hichens
and
claire
he
took
them
all
into
the
little
lounge
where
they
drank
cocktails
together
gregory
was
suddenly
in
joyous
spirits
and
claire
thoroughly
responsive
they
made
plans
for
the
next
few
days
and
ended
up
with
a
race
round
the
deck
the
course
being
kept
clear
by
a
little
handful
of
amused
passengers
the
captain
coming
upon
them
breathless
just
as
the
bugle
sounded
invited
gregory
to
his
table
for
dinner
and
gregory
his
unsociability
altogether
dispersed
proved
a
most
attractive
guest
of
his
own
exploits
he
tried
to
talk
as
little
as
possible
but
the
ballastons
had
been
a
family
well
known
in
sporting
and
political
circles
for
generations
and
there
were
plenty
of
anecdotes
to
be
told
of
english
life
for
claire
amusement
a
general
engaged
him
in
kindly
reminiscences
of
france
and
he
found
an
old
etonian
and
a
junior
diplomat
on
his
way
home
from
japan
they
sat
at
table
until
long
after
the
others
had
left
and
the
music
had
already
commenced
when
they
trooped
up
the
gangway
what
a
wonderful
evening
claire
exclaimed
delightedly
and
now
we
are
going
to
dance
the
orchestra
welcomed
them
back
again
with
kindly
smiles
the
lanterns
which
enclosed
the
little
space
of
deck
were
like
fairy
lights
the
music
streamed
out
to
them
even
its
ordinary
melodies
somehow
beautified
by
their
own
sense
of
and
the
glamour
of
their
surroundings
claire
danced
from
pure
love
of
graceful
movement
from
that
impulse
of
rhythm
which
passes
behind
history
into
legend
gregory
a
born
athlete
and
as
an
indian
suffering
nothing
from
his
ignorance
of
the
more
modern
steps
once
or
twice
they
rested
but
always
impatiently
always
with
their
senses
tingling
with
the
joy
of
rhythmical
motion
it
was
not
until
the
end
of
the
programme
that
claire
realised
suddenly
that
her
companion
had
been
dancing
during
the
last
few
minutes
with
unusual
stiffness
he
was
pale
and
breathing
more
quickly
than
usual
how
selfish
of
me
she
exclaimed
of
course
you
are
tired
let
us
sit
out
for
a
few
minutes
somewhere
where
the
music
does
haunt
us
they
found
two
chairs
in
a
retired
corner
gregory
seemed
to
have
thrown
off
his
reserves
to
have
become
once
more
fluent
and
discoursive
his
voice
lowered
because
of
occasional
promenaders
had
developed
an
almost
passionate
timbre
there
was
a
light
in
his
eyes
which
half
puzzled
half
thrilled
her
his
hands
sought
her
fingers
underneath
the
rug
which
they
shared
she
suffered
him
to
hold
them
for
a
moment
before
she
drew
them
gently
away
i
have
never
forgotten
he
told
her
how
i
saw
you
first
you
came
into
that
crazy
old
warehouse
with
its
piles
of
silks
and
rugs
and
carpets
and
shelves
of
jade
and
china
and
its
quaint
odour
the
perfume
of
china
and
the
east
you
threaded
your
way
through
that
group
of
chinamen
in
that
spotless
white
dress
of
yours
in
the
hat
with
the
yellow
flowers
like
something
fresh
and
sweet
from
a
new
world
from
a
world
where
the
sun
did
bake
and
shrivel
everything
to
dust
or
those
dank
humid
mists
make
slime
of
the
ground
underneath
she
laughed
softly
i
think
the
poetry
of
this
afternoon
is
lingering
in
your
brain
she
said
still
i
dare
say
it
was
strange
to
see
an
american
girl
with
a
new
york
frock
amongst
all
that
medley
you
must
have
thought
our
little
house
stranger
yet
can
you
imagine
my
uncle
surrounded
with
all
those
beautiful
things
living
between
bare
walls
and
with
upon
the
floor
and
am
i
very
greedy
with
such
a
terrible
cook
are
you
shocked
at
me
for
my
materialism
you
know
i
never
pretended
to
be
anything
else
i
love
life
as
it
comes
to
me
day
by
day
with
just
the
things
it
brings
and
i
love
life
as
i
find
it
now
he
whispered
it
seems
too
wonderful
to
think
that
you
too
are
on
your
way
to
england
and
that
we
going
to
be
almost
neighbours
but
you
are
never
at
home
she
reminded
him
with
a
smile
i
had
nothing
to
keep
me
at
home
he
rejoined
in
the
future
it
may
be
different
already
i
begin
to
feel
that
my
love
of
wandering
is
finished
perhaps
she
suggested
softly
we
had
better
dance
she
rose
to
her
feet
and
he
acquiesced
at
once
as
he
leaned
towards
her
his
face
as
white
as
marble
in
the
moonlight
he
was
undoubtedly
handsome
yet
once
again
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
something
in
his
eyes
which
filled
her
with
a
vague
uneasiness
yes
we
dance
he
assented
you
teaching
me
to
understand
what
dancing
means
the
last
time
when
was
it
alexandria
i
believe
he
stopped
abruptly
confused
by
a
turbulent
flood
of
memory
they
moved
away
to
the
music
in
and
out
of
the
string
of
lights
rocking
now
in
an
unexpected
night
breeze
claire
danced
still
with
the
joy
of
her
youthful
strength
and
gracious
temperament
once
or
twice
when
gregory
arm
seemed
to
be
drawing
her
a
little
closer
she
freed
herself
slightly
once
she
caught
a
flash
of
that
disturbing
glint
in
his
eyes
but
she
only
laughed
at
her
own
uneasiness
please
do
look
so
terribly
in
earnest
she
begged
him
dancing
is
one
of
the
happiest
things
in
the
world
we
must
keep
that
feeling
always
with
us
the
music
came
to
an
abrupt
finish
claire
looked
across
at
the
leader
of
the
orchestra
in
dismay
but
it
was
too
late
for
intervention
already
the
first
notes
of
god
save
the
king
had
been
struck
well
it
has
been
lovely
she
declared
i
suppose
i
must
go
and
look
for
mrs
hichens
come
and
have
a
lemon
squash
first
he
begged
the
steward
served
them
out
on
deck
gregory
drank
a
whisky
and
soda
as
though
it
had
been
water
let
sit
out
for
a
time
he
suggested
it
is
too
warm
to
sleep
down
below
i
fetch
some
more
rugs
she
shook
her
head
and
rose
regretfully
to
her
feet
it
has
been
delightful
she
admitted
but
after
all
it
is
eleven
they
strolled
along
the
deck
suddenly
he
gripped
her
by
the
arm
they
were
passing
his
stateroom
perkins
was
moving
about
and
the
light
was
lit
he
pointed
in
through
the
door
only
a
few
feet
away
let
me
show
you
my
evil
genius
he
begged
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
with
the
steward
smilingly
standing
on
one
side
for
her
to
enter
her
hesitation
seemed
ridiculous
she
crossed
the
threshold
as
perkins
disappeared
with
a
suave
good
night
gregory
stood
by
her
side
and
pointed
to
the
image
she
gave
a
little
gasp
for
several
moments
neither
of
them
spoke
they
both
gazed
at
it
intently
claire
with
wondering
horror
gregory
fighting
against
some
sympathetic
suggestion
in
the
cynical
brutality
of
the
thick
mocking
lips
what
a
ghastly
thing
to
own
she
cried
the
hand
which
had
been
holding
her
arm
was
suddenly
round
her
waist
look
at
it
by
moonlight
he
whispered
in
her
ear
the
forefinger
of
his
other
hand
touched
the
switch
they
were
almost
in
darkness
his
eyes
suddenly
seemed
to
be
blazing
into
hers
she
felt
the
burning
of
his
lips
even
as
they
drew
near
there
was
something
sweet
but
vaguely
evil
in
his
tone
claire
you
are
adorable
she
wrenched
herself
free
free
from
arms
which
had
seemed
to
be
closing
like
a
vice
round
her
away
from
lips
whose
very
proximity
seemed
to
scorch
she
staggered
through
the
door
as
she
stood
there
on
the
deck
the
light
flashed
out
again
and
gregory
suddenly
it
seemed
almost
calm
stood
upon
the
threshold
a
courteous
but
sardonic
farewell
upon
his
lips
good
night
he
said
you
realise
now
perhaps
what
it
is
for
a
man
to
live
with
so
evil
a
thing
she
swayed
as
she
neared
the
companionway
and
steadied
herself
in
her
descent
by
the
banisters
when
she
reached
her
room
she
locked
the
door
behind
her
and
threw
herself
upon
the
gregory
had
moved
back
into
his
stateroom
his
fist
hard
and
clenched
was
within
a
few
inches
of
the
leering
mouth
you
damned
swine
he
exclaimed
with
all
his
calmness
gone
a
hoarse
fury
breaking
his
voice
you
you
accursed
spirit
his
voice
suddenly
failed
an
overpowering
impulse
seized
him
he
took
the
image
into
his
arms
rushed
through
the
open
door
across
the
deck
and
leaned
over
the
rail
find
your
own
hell
he
shouted
and
dashed
it
downwards
chapter
viii
in
the
morning
gregory
awoke
after
a
wonderfully
sound
sleep
it
was
still
very
early
there
was
a
delightful
pearly
light
in
the
sky
visible
through
his
open
porthole
the
glitter
of
the
barely
risen
sun
lay
faint
upon
the
ocean
he
remained
for
a
few
minutes
breathing
quietly
trying
to
recall
the
events
of
the
night
before
they
came
back
to
him
with
a
shock
followed
by
an
immense
sense
of
relief
he
remembered
what
he
had
done
without
a
thought
of
regret
he
had
cast
away
the
fruits
of
his
enterprise
the
possibility
of
wealth
and
he
was
full
of
rejoicing
in
those
few
seconds
of
glad
thought
the
world
seemed
a
different
place
wealth
after
all
but
a
trifling
part
of
its
joys
youth
and
love
suddenly
great
and
wonderful
things
a
clearer
light
seemed
to
be
pouring
in
upon
some
possible
future
a
new
atmosphere
of
happiness
encircling
him
he
sprang
out
of
bed
he
would
have
an
early
bath
and
send
a
note
round
to
claire
she
must
forgive
she
must
understand
she
must
realise
the
sacrifice
he
had
made
then
as
he
reached
for
his
dressing
gown
he
felt
as
though
he
were
turned
to
stone
up
on
its
accustomed
place
its
eyes
meeting
his
its
lips
mocking
him
was
the
image
he
stood
looking
at
it
for
once
genuinely
terrified
then
he
pressed
the
bell
feverishly
and
stood
there
with
his
thumb
upon
the
knob
until
perkins
came
running
in
where
the
hell
did
that
come
from
he
demanded
pointing
to
the
image
perkins
smiled
with
the
air
of
one
who
imparts
good
tidings
the
sent
it
up
early
this
morning
sir
he
explained
it
was
in
one
of
the
lower
boats
swung
out
from
the
main
deck
gone
right
through
the
canvas
but
there
is
a
scratch
on
it
gregory
drew
on
his
dressing
gown
and
staggered
out
on
to
the
deck
he
walked
up
and
down
for
an
hour
and
a
half
fighting
a
distinct
and
definite
battle
and
with
every
step
he
took
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
became
saner
his
waking
idea
took
shape
gave
him
encouragement
and
life
with
his
craving
for
what
it
might
have
to
give
abandoned
the
power
of
the
image
too
for
evil
must
decline
he
wanted
those
jewels
no
longer
he
was
ready
to
face
life
and
all
its
possibilities
from
a
new
standard
he
went
down
to
his
bath
visited
the
barber
and
dressed
before
any
of
the
passengers
were
astir
then
he
made
his
way
into
the
writing
room
and
drew
paper
and
ink
towards
him
he
wrote
fluently
and
without
hesitation
all
that
he
wished
to
say
seemed
so
clear
these
few
lines
dear
bring
my
prayer
to
you
for
pardon
the
doctor
talks
of
nerves
well
i
never
suffered
from
them
and
i
would
as
soon
believe
in
the
supernatural
i
believe
that
there
is
evil
in
my
treasure
last
night
in
a
fit
of
i
tried
to
throw
it
overboard
but
it
was
caught
by
one
of
the
boats
on
the
lower
deck
and
when
i
awoke
this
morning
it
was
back
in
its
accustomed
place
if
your
answer
to
this
note
is
what
i
pray
for
it
will
be
overboard
before
we
meet
and
overboard
in
such
a
place
that
it
will
sink
to
the
bottom
of
the
sea
will
you
marry
me
claire
as
soon
as
we
reach
england
and
my
father
and
your
uncle
can
meet
and
give
their
consent
i
pretend
that
i
am
a
particularly
desirable
person
but
i
am
at
any
rate
not
too
bad
to
realise
that
you
are
the
dearest
and
sweetest
thing
i
have
ever
met
or
to
fail
in
keeping
my
word
when
i
promise
that
you
shall
never
regret
it
if
you
say
yes
i
have
a
great
deal
to
offer
you
beyond
my
love
but
that
i
offer
to
you
not
in
the
spirit
of
last
night
in
the
shadow
of
that
accursed
image
but
earnestly
and
faithfully
and
eternally
please
send
me
just
a
line
the
black
buddha
waits
to
know
his
fate
and
i
mine
gregory
perkins
took
the
note
and
after
his
departure
gregory
climbed
to
the
upper
deck
and
stood
there
leaning
over
the
rail
forgetting
even
to
smoke
watching
the
sun
mount
a
little
higher
and
spread
its
gleams
a
little
farther
across
the
ocean
watching
the
blue
haze
of
coming
heat
blot
out
the
clearness
of
the
horizon
waiting
with
an
eagerness
utterly
unfamiliar
with
a
sense
of
having
suddenly
changed
personalities
with
some
simpler
and
stronger
being
at
last
the
head
and
shoulders
of
perkins
appeared
coming
up
the
ladder
your
breakfast
is
in
your
room
sir
he
announced
as
he
handed
over
the
note
he
was
carrying
gregory
made
no
reply
he
was
looking
at
the
handwriting
upon
the
envelope
rather
faint
and
delicate
not
too
legible
for
a
moment
or
two
he
turned
the
note
over
he
absolutely
feared
to
open
it
a
wave
of
pessimism
had
seized
him
then
he
suddenly
tore
the
envelope
across
and
read
dear
ballaston
i
am
so
sorry
but
i
can
not
say
yes
i
appreciate
your
letter
and
i
try
to
sympathise
with
what
lies
behind
it
but
to
be
quite
honest
i
can
not
just
now
believe
in
you
i
do
not
myself
believe
in
the
supernatural
nor
can
i
bring
myself
to
believe
in
the
superstition
of
which
you
speak
i
can
therefore
only
think
of
you
as
one
whom
i
was
beginning
to
like
very
much
indeed
but
who
has
disappointed
me
bitterly
i
am
sorry
but
that
is
how
i
feel
and
it
is
useless
for
me
to
pretend
otherwise
if
you
wish
to
be
kind
please
keep
away
it
is
foolish
of
course
but
you
see
i
am
a
little
lonely
here
and
after
what
has
happened
i
shall
feel
so
much
happier
not
to
find
myself
alone
with
you
again
claire
endacott
gregory
read
the
letter
twice
then
sent
it
fluttering
away
in
little
white
fragments
watching
them
fall
like
snowflakes
upon
the
sea
afterwards
he
descended
to
his
stateroom
he
sat
on
his
camp
stool
stirred
his
coffee
and
looked
across
at
the
image
then
with
his
left
hand
he
kissed
his
fingers
to
it
i
give
you
best
my
friend
he
groaned
count
me
your
disciple
gregory
was
on
deck
even
before
his
accustomed
time
he
showed
unusual
interest
in
the
ship
run
and
greeted
claire
when
she
appeared
very
late
and
looking
pale
and
tired
with
the
casualness
of
a
steamer
acquaintance
he
talked
lightly
with
hichens
exchanged
remarks
with
his
other
fellow
passengers
and
notwithstanding
the
slight
air
of
aloofness
which
was
habitual
to
him
he
took
a
prominent
part
in
the
sports
of
the
day
he
conducted
an
auction
pool
with
success
and
he
refused
no
man
invitation
to
drink
at
night
though
when
the
dancing
started
he
obstinately
refused
to
leave
the
smoking
room
pleaded
a
weak
ankle
and
confessed
to
an
inordinate
thirst
the
doctor
came
in
and
sat
beside
him
more
trouble
he
asked
quietly
gregory
shrugged
his
shoulders
no
particular
trouble
he
replied
i
rather
fed
up
with
dancing
besides
which
i
have
worn
through
the
soles
of
my
only
pair
of
patent
shoes
is
miss
endacott
in
a
similar
predicament
the
doctor
enquired
i
see
that
she
is
not
on
deck
miss
endacott
is
probably
reading
one
of
paley
sermons
to
hichens
he
answered
a
little
sarcastically
i
wonder
why
the
devil
some
one
does
look
after
your
libraries
on
board
ship
doctor
there
are
no
less
than
eleven
different
volumes
of
sermons
there
no
doubt
you
got
them
cheap
but
who
wants
them
especially
on
a
voyage
where
one
is
supposed
to
send
one
morals
overland
the
doctor
rose
to
his
feet
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
for
you
he
asked
nothing
gregory
replied
have
a
drink
the
doctor
shook
his
head
i
am
in
earnest
he
persisted
i
am
still
at
your
disposal
if
you
want
a
sleeping
draught
i
your
man
or
an
ambassador
well
i
here
otherwise
it
happens
to
be
otherwise
gregory
declared
a
little
brutally
perkins
gregory
ballaston
asked
sitting
up
in
his
bunk
a
few
mornings
later
and
gazing
distastefully
at
his
tea
was
i
very
drunk
last
night
no
more
than
usual
sir
was
the
man
somewhat
gloomy
answer
the
chief
steward
in
the
second
class
sent
for
me
and
i
brought
you
up
myself
gregory
sighed
bad
perkins
bad
he
admitted
i
ought
not
to
have
gone
there
at
all
was
i
er
misbehaving
more
than
usual
you
seemed
to
be
making
a
little
free
with
the
young
women
down
there
if
i
might
say
so
sir
perkins
replied
gregory
poured
himself
out
some
tea
well
it
was
the
last
night
anyhow
he
said
with
an
air
of
relief
i
am
landing
at
marseilles
i
have
packed
most
of
your
things
sir
the
man
announced
i
expect
they
bustle
the
overland
passengers
off
the
ship
as
quickly
as
possible
we
a
good
many
hours
late
as
it
is
and
the
train
will
be
waiting
i
am
going
the
other
way
gregory
confided
i
have
a
strange
feeling
perkins
that
i
am
likely
to
win
at
monte
carlo
i
have
been
there
twice
before
and
lost
pretty
well
all
i
possessed
at
the
moment
this
time
i
feel
like
winning
anyway
i
am
going
to
try
my
luck
when
shall
i
be
able
to
finish
your
packing
sir
whenever
you
like
and
as
soon
as
you
like
i
do
care
for
this
ship
perkins
you
a
good
fellow
and
you
looked
after
me
very
well
but
i
do
like
the
rest
of
them
any
more
than
they
like
me
you
say
that
i
was
a
popular
person
on
board
would
you
perkins
the
man
made
no
reply
for
a
moment
he
was
occupied
thrusting
the
trees
into
some
evening
slippers
if
i
might
make
so
bold
sir
he
said
at
last
you
have
only
yourself
to
thank
for
what
people
think
you
have
acted
queerly
more
than
once
sir
a
fact
gregory
murmured
a
damnable
fact
and
i
do
hold
the
man
went
on
with
this
sitting
in
the
smoking
room
taking
a
drink
with
anybody
who
comes
along
and
going
down
to
the
second
class
when
there
plenty
of
your
own
sort
on
board
sir
you
a
sound
fellow
perkins
gregory
admitted
as
he
swung
out
of
his
bunk
is
my
bath
ready
waiting
sir
and
perkins
gregory
continued
as
he
struggled
into
his
dressing
gown
some
time
this
morning
i
want
you
to
bring
me
some
packing
cloth
and
get
the
carpenter
to
find
you
a
box
i
ca
take
my
image
about
like
that
i
going
to
send
it
home
to
my
father
a
little
souvenir
of
my
visit
to
china
i
think
it
might
brighten
up
the
household
i
fetch
you
the
packing
cloth
and
box
sir
with
pleasure
perkins
assented
looking
up
at
the
image
dubiously
but
if
it
belonged
to
me
i
know
what
i
should
do
with
it
gregory
paused
enquiringly
the
steward
was
still
looking
over
the
rail
of
the
bunk
with
an
expression
of
disgust
i
should
chuck
it
overboard
and
have
done
with
it
sir
but
it
is
valuable
gregory
expostulated
swinging
his
towel
worth
a
lot
of
money
perkins
no
one
knows
quite
how
much
but
it
worth
a
great
deal
of
money
for
its
looks
anyway
the
man
muttered
gregory
went
through
his
usual
morning
routine
his
bath
the
swim
the
gymnasium
and
the
coiffeur
afterwards
he
made
a
leisurely
toilet
in
his
stateroom
slipped
out
on
to
the
deck
at
a
moment
when
it
was
almost
deserted
and
walked
across
to
the
smoking
room
with
swift
footsteps
lithe
and
graceful
notwithstanding
the
debauch
of
the
night
before
carefully
dressed
as
usual
his
eyes
as
bright
as
ever
no
sign
of
evil
living
in
his
clear
complexion
yet
for
all
his
presentability
no
one
knew
better
than
he
that
he
had
gradually
become
the
most
unpopular
person
upon
the
ship
the
captain
had
taken
to
looking
the
other
way
when
he
passed
the
doctor
nod
was
of
the
curtest
hichens
never
pretended
not
to
cut
him
claire
alone
on
the
few
occasions
when
they
passed
or
met
face
to
face
bowed
gravely
sometimes
even
exchanged
a
word
of
greeting
she
still
spent
the
time
on
deck
as
usual
but
always
with
hichens
by
her
side
one
or
two
of
the
women
with
whom
he
had
exchanged
a
few
civilities
still
looked
wistfully
for
him
when
the
dancing
began
his
grass
widow
had
indeed
boldly
attempted
to
waylay
him
one
evening
on
his
return
from
the
dining
saloon
gregory
however
lied
with
cynical
impudence
declared
that
he
had
sprained
his
ankle
and
would
not
dance
again
for
the
rest
of
the
voyage
and
then
promptly
walked
alone
for
an
hour
through
the
summer
darkness
on
the
upper
deck
on
another
occasion
an
enterprising
young
woman
whose
courage
was
greater
than
her
discretion
sought
him
out
in
the
smoking
room
and
tried
to
gain
his
confidence
she
rejoined
her
friends
after
a
very
brief
absence
a
little
ruffled
gregory
politeness
was
icy
but
on
one
point
he
seemed
to
have
made
up
his
mind
he
was
ready
to
gamble
with
any
one
to
drink
with
any
one
but
so
far
as
the
women
were
concerned
the
women
of
his
own
quarter
of
the
ship
he
avoided
them
with
a
finality
which
admitted
of
no
advances
he
played
cards
all
through
the
long
summer
days
and
moonlit
mediterranean
nights
for
stakes
much
higher
than
the
ship
officers
approved
of
but
he
never
approached
the
dancing
spaces
or
entered
the
music
room
where
the
ladies
congregated
rumour
went
about
that
he
had
been
sent
to
coventry
and
as
was
natural
on
an
eastern
liner
there
were
no
end
of
scandalous
stories
one
of
them
and
a
name
he
happened
to
overhear
and
he
gave
the
smoking
room
something
to
gossip
about
for
the
rest
of
the
day
he
rose
from
his
seat
and
approached
the
little
group
may
i
ask
your
name
sir
he
enquired
of
the
man
who
had
told
the
story
a
large
man
well
under
medium
age
but
puffy
and
why
you
surely
may
was
the
prompt
reply
richard
thomson
played
cards
together
more
than
once
well
thomson
gregory
said
i
have
to
tell
you
that
i
dislike
the
mention
of
ladies
names
in
a
smoking
room
i
dislike
it
so
much
especially
when
allied
with
scandalous
fiction
that
i
am
going
to
throw
you
out
on
to
the
deck
the
man
tried
bluster
but
he
fared
the
worse
for
it
he
picked
himself
up
sprawling
from
somewhere
near
the
rails
and
spent
his
morning
trying
to
interview
various
officers
of
the
ship
the
purser
at
last
was
commissioned
to
approach
gregory
i
have
a
complaint
ballaston
he
announced
a
little
stiffly
from
thomson
he
asserts
that
you
used
violence
to
him
in
the
smoking
room
quite
correct
was
the
deliberate
reply
i
do
like
him
i
shall
probably
throw
him
out
again
if
he
comes
in
an
affair
of
this
sort
is
not
to
be
treated
so
lightly
sir
the
purser
declared
i
must
request
some
sort
of
an
explanation
or
else
that
you
apologise
to
mr
thomson
gregory
considered
for
a
moment
very
well
he
said
i
will
offer
you
this
much
of
an
explanation
i
heard
thomson
make
use
of
the
name
of
a
young
lady
in
the
smoking
room
he
coupled
her
name
with
a
story
which
although
it
may
not
have
reflected
any
positive
discredit
upon
her
was
yet
untrue
i
object
to
the
use
of
ladies
names
in
a
smoking
room
and
i
did
what
i
should
have
done
at
any
time
in
my
life
and
what
i
should
do
again
this
afternoon
and
again
if
necessary
i
threw
him
out
as
to
apologising
to
him
i
will
fight
him
with
one
hand
or
standing
on
one
leg
or
i
will
shoot
at
him
and
let
him
shoot
at
me
from
any
mark
he
likes
or
give
him
what
is
termed
in
any
such
manner
as
he
can
suggest
but
sooner
than
apologise
i
would
throw
him
overboard
first
and
spend
the
rest
of
the
voyage
in
irons
myself
if
necessary
the
purser
face
relaxed
i
will
report
your
explanation
to
the
captain
ballaston
he
promised
nothing
more
was
heard
of
the
matter
thomson
somewhat
ostentatiously
played
bridge
out
on
deck
with
his
friends
and
gregory
suddenly
sick
of
his
companions
invaded
the
ship
library
and
abjured
cards
he
drew
a
great
sigh
of
relief
when
at
last
amidst
the
screaming
of
tugs
and
a
strange
silence
in
the
engine
room
they
were
brought
in
to
marseilles
docks
he
lingered
about
for
an
hour
after
the
gangways
were
down
hoping
to
be
the
last
to
leave
the
ship
in
the
customs
shed
however
when
he
made
his
belated
appearance
there
he
came
face
to
face
with
claire
and
hichens
the
latter
ignored
him
claire
held
out
her
hand
ballaston
she
said
gregory
was
taken
aback
he
could
not
refuse
her
hand
but
he
could
find
no
words
hichens
walked
on
they
were
for
a
moment
alone
together
i
am
very
sorry
she
continued
that
i
had
to
answer
your
letter
as
i
felt
i
am
trying
to
forget
all
that
is
disagreeable
in
our
friendship
and
remember
only
how
thoroughly
we
enjoyed
the
first
part
of
the
voyage
will
you
please
do
the
same
and
she
was
gone
with
a
friendly
little
nod
before
he
could
gasp
out
any
more
than
a
muttered
monosyllable
for
a
moment
he
almost
followed
her
then
he
realised
a
certain
finality
about
that
gesture
and
turned
away
before
he
had
finished
with
the
customs
the
paris
train
had
left
he
stood
for
a
while
at
the
barrier
looking
after
it
almost
wistfully
his
thoughts
travelling
homeward
it
was
late
spring
now
there
would
be
a
scent
of
violets
in
the
air
cowslips
coming
up
in
the
meadows
honeysuckle
in
the
hedges
and
sweeter
than
anything
the
wild
roses
making
their
faint
appearance
he
thought
of
the
rambling
stately
gardens
at
the
hall
the
odour
of
the
late
hyacinths
the
warmth
of
the
sun
on
the
day
when
the
gardeners
opened
the
potting
sheds
and
brought
out
the
geraniums
he
could
hear
the
lazy
humming
of
the
mowing
machines
the
soft
splash
of
water
from
the
fountain
on
one
of
the
terraced
lawns
it
was
a
very
beautiful
home
there
waiting
for
him
perhaps
a
little
silent
a
long
way
aloof
from
the
throb
and
thrill
of
life
the
of
happiness
which
he
had
pursued
so
tirelessly
which
he
was
in
quest
of
again
even
now
then
he
had
a
sudden
vision
of
claire
and
of
showing
her
the
house
the
gardens
the
park
the
woods
beyond
the
peace
of
it
the
softly
flowing
waters
of
the
trout
stream
the
hum
of
insects
he
had
a
vision
of
claire
too
seated
at
the
carriage
window
looking
out
perhaps
herself
not
wholly
happy
perhaps
even
at
that
moment
with
a
tear
in
those
still
tender
eyes
the
sweetness
of
her
the
sweetness
which
he
had
terrified
the
childishness
which
that
accursed
image
would
have
had
him
disturb
it
was
like
a
black
cloud
upon
his
mind
and
thoughts
then
a
raucous
voice
in
his
ear
il
faut
vous
dépêcher
vos
bagages
pour
monte
carlo
monsieur
le
rapide
arrive
his
fit
of
dreaming
passed
and
he
came
back
to
the
world
of
small
everyday
things
went
through
the
tiresome
formality
of
registering
his
luggage
found
a
place
in
an
empty
compartment
dozed
and
dreamed
a
little
more
and
finally
was
dragged
behind
a
screaming
locomotive
into
the
curiously
unimpressive
station
of
monte
carlo
the
hills
behind
glittering
with
lights
the
long
sea
front
curving
away
into
italy
he
shook
himself
and
descending
made
his
way
to
the
hotel
bathed
and
changed
and
sat
down
to
write
a
few
momentous
lines
home
hotel
de
paris
monte
carlo
my
dear
father
i
have
come
here
from
marseilles
for
a
few
days
perhaps
longer
it
depends
upon
the
luck
meanwhile
you
will
receive
from
tilbury
soon
after
the
ship
docks
the
image
we
got
away
with
you
wo
like
it
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
i
loathed
it
you
would
think
i
was
mad
but
from
the
practical
point
of
view
everything
that
i
heard
in
china
confirms
your
story
in
either
this
image
or
the
other
one
which
alas
fell
into
the
hands
of
a
firm
called
johnson
and
company
who
have
branches
nearly
everywhere
in
the
east
are
packed
the
whole
of
the
treasures
of
the
temple
have
an
expert
examine
it
but
do
do
anything
about
breaking
it
up
until
i
return
there
are
reasons
against
this
i
suppose
everything
is
as
usual
no
money
heavier
taxation
plenty
of
debts
and
uncle
henry
denying
himself
even
a
new
suit
of
clothes
i
hope
madame
progresses
and
that
her
new
doctor
will
be
able
to
work
the
great
miracle
here
is
an
amazing
coincidence
of
which
you
will
hear
more
before
you
see
me
in
the
last
letter
i
wrote
you
i
told
you
about
my
adventure
on
the
river
and
wu
ling
the
chinese
trader
who
rescued
me
well
wu
ling
is
a
member
of
the
firm
of
johnson
and
company
the
great
eastern
merchants
and
one
of
his
partners
is
ralph
endacott
who
used
to
have
a
chair
at
oxford
a
great
oriental
scholar
and
as
you
perhaps
know
madame
brother
he
has
a
very
delightful
niece
whom
i
saw
something
of
on
the
voyage
home
he
himself
is
winding
up
his
affairs
and
coming
to
england
shortly
they
have
some
idea
i
believe
of
taking
a
house
in
norfolk
endacott
himself
is
a
somewhat
austere
person
who
looked
upon
my
enterprise
with
a
good
deal
of
disfavour
and
myself
i
am
afraid
with
more
the
niece
however
is
perfectly
charming
well
i
shall
be
home
for
the
summer
i
got
through
all
right
without
a
scratch
as
you
know
but
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
i
think
i
have
a
touch
of
nerves
the
shadow
of
our
elms
ought
to
help
i
write
again
as
soon
as
i
have
decided
when
to
come
home
thanks
for
your
last
letter
i
do
think
you
need
send
any
money
if
i
want
it
i
wire
ever
yours
gregory
gregory
dined
alone
receiving
the
warm
welcome
of
the
maîtres
with
whom
he
was
acquainted
and
the
other
supernumeraries
of
the
great
hotel
afterwards
he
went
across
and
took
out
his
cards
of
admission
to
the
casino
flung
a
few
counters
on
one
of
the
outside
tables
in
the
kitchen
and
losing
them
came
out
called
in
at
the
office
of
the
sporting
club
for
his
ticket
and
presently
mounted
the
front
stairs
prepared
for
such
serious
gambling
as
he
could
afford
there
was
something
almost
allegorical
in
the
wide
opening
of
the
doors
as
he
entered
he
seemed
engulfed
once
more
into
the
world
of
pleasurable
adventure
only
for
the
first
time
the
whole
thrill
of
it
was
wanting
the
tables
themselves
he
eyed
with
all
his
old
appetite
as
he
counted
his
money
and
planned
his
campaign
his
inherited
love
of
gambling
was
undeniable
the
green
cloth
the
patter
of
the
cards
the
call
of
the
croupiers
the
rattling
of
the
roulette
ball
each
had
their
fascination
it
was
the
other
things
of
which
he
seemed
to
have
suddenly
tired
which
somehow
in
a
moment
of
presentiment
as
he
looked
through
one
of
the
great
windows
towards
the
moon
hanging
down
over
the
harbour
he
knew
would
never
appeal
to
him
in
quite
the
same
way
again
the
following
morning
he
supplemented
his
letter
home
by
a
telegram
to
sir
bertram
ballaston
baronet
ballaston
hall
norfolk
england
do
send
any
money

milles
very
bored

with
carruthers
shall
return
within
a
month
gregory
end
of
book
one
book
two
chapter
i
it
was
in
a
sense
a
dinner
of
celebration
at
ballaston
hall
in
which
these
four
men
were
concerned
although
with
the
exception
of
one
guest
it
was
a
family
party
at
the
head
of
the
table
sat
sir
bertram
thin
long
and
with
brilliant
dark
eyes
almost
black
lips
and
mouth
sometimes
cruel
sometimes
humorous
a
famous
spendthrift
an
occasional
libertine
but
without
a
doubt
a
great
sportsman
on
his
left
gregory
an
almost
startling
reproduction
of
his
father
but
with
uncertainties
in
his
face
and
expression
which
time
as
yet
had
not
moulded
next
to
him
his
uncle
henry
ballaston
a
smaller
man
stiff
cold
courtly
and
formal
in
speech
and
manner
with
greater
capacities
for
kindliness
but
entirely
devoid
of
that
humorous
twitch
to
the
mouth
he
wore
side
whiskers
his
dress
waistcoat
showed
less
than
the
usual
amount
of
shirt
front
and
his
tie
was
almost
a
stock
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
table
sat
borroughes
the
agent
to
the
estates
a
mixture
of
sportsman
man
of
affairs
and
sycophant
never
altogether
at
ease
with
his
host
and
in
consequence
rather
overdoing
the
assumption
of
such
a
state
below
the
little
party
was
a
vast
expanse
of
polished
but
empty
mahogany
for
dinner
had
been
served
in
the
great
banquetting
hall
where
places
had
often
been
laid
in
the
past
for
as
many
as
sixty
guests
rawson
the
butler
ponderous
yet
emerged
from
the
shadows
of
the
apartment
carrying
a
second
decanter
of
the
port
which
they
had
been
drinking
he
placed
it
reverently
before
sir
bertram
who
lifted
it
first
to
the
light
poured
a
little
into
his
glass
sipped
it
and
then
passed
the
decanter
on
to
his
son
excellent
he
pronounced
almost
as
good
a
bottle
as
the
first
a
wonderful
bin
henry
my
dear
henry
his
brother
handed
the
decanter
across
the
table
to
borroughes
you
are
aware
bertram
he
said
that
two
glasses
of
wine
after
dinner
are
all
i
care
for
his
speech
was
rather
like
that
of
an
lawyer
prim
a
little
clipped
extraordinarily
precise
sir
bertram
sighed
i
wonder
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
world
he
murmured
which
would
ever
induce
henry
to
diverge
from
a
habit
it
is
less
prejudice
than
a
partiality
the
latter
pronounced
two
glasses
i
enjoy
more
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
bring
me
no
pleasure
i
agree
with
you
bertram
that
it
is
an
excellent
bin
i
always
enjoy
this
wine
and
i
have
been
happier
than
usual
in
drinking
it
this
evening
on
account
of
our
pleasure
in
welcoming
gregory
home
again
tell
me
about
our
new
tenants
at
the
great
house
gregory
enquired
presently
addressing
borroughes
very
desirable
very
desirable
indeed
the
latter
replied
delighted
at
the
chance
of
entering
into
the
conversation
endacott
curiously
enough
endacott
gregory
interrupted
did
you
say
endacott
gregory
whose
first
enquiry
had
been
a
casual
one
had
set
down
the
glass
which
he
had
been
in
the
act
of
raising
to
his
lips
and
was
staring
at
borroughes
incredulously
staring
at
him
and
yet
through
him
convinced
in
his
heart
suddenly
realising
what
had
happened
yes
ralph
endacott
borroughes
continued
curiously
enough
he
belongs
to
an
old
norfolk
family
although
he
has
lived
all
his
life
in
china
madame
de
fourgenet
whom
every
one
round
here
calls
is
his
sister
he
is
a
great
oriental
scholar
i
believe
a
famous
man
at
oxford
in
his
day
then
there
his
niece
miss
claire
endacott
very
girl
that
all
the
family
they
have
taken
the
place
just
as
it
stands
furniture
and
all
for
three
years
and
paying
the
full
rent
too
thank
god
sir
bertram
added
i
meant
to
have
told
you
gregory
but
we
scarcely
had
a
minute
together
yet
you
met
the
old
chap
in
china
did
you
and
of
course
you
travelled
home
as
far
as
marseilles
with
the
girl
endacott
was
a
partner
in
the
great
eastern
firm
of
johnson
and
company
with
branches
at
alexandria
tokio
and
at
several
places
in
china
borroughes
went
on
i
made
use
of
his
banker
references
and
was
given
to
understand
that
he
was
a
man
of
great
wealth
he
knew
to
whom
the
property
belonged
before
he
took
the
house
i
suppose
gregory
enquired
naturally
the
agent
replied
it
was
his
sister
who
wrote
to
him
about
it
quite
a
remarkable
coincidence
your
having
come
across
him
in
china
sir
bertram
observed
moving
the
decanter
once
more
towards
his
son
i
wonder
if
he
knows
anything
about
your
new
possession
gregory
he
knows
more
about
it
was
the
somewhat
grim
response
than
any
other
man
breathing
his
firm
as
a
matter
of
fact
bought
the
twin
image
from
one
of
the
robbers
who
held
up
and
looted
the
train
from
pekin
a
small
world
indeed
sir
bertram
murmured
tell
us
more
about
your
coming
into
touch
with
these
people
johnson
and
company
i
am
interested
gregory
glanced
into
the
shadows
rawson
was
out
of
sight
at
a
huge
sideboard
only
dimly
visible
at
the
other
end
of
the
room
and
the
footmen
had
already
departed
well
i
told
you
have
i
the
story
of
my
rescue
on
the
river
by
wu
ling
gregory
proceeded
it
seems
this
fellow
is
one
of
the
firm
and
does
all
the
native
trading
for
johnson
and
company
naturally
i
called
upon
him
before
i
sailed
and
found
him
in
their
warehouse
the
most
astonishing
place
i
told
him
of
what
had
happened
to
poor
hammonde
and
that
only
one
of
the
images
had
turned
up
he
listened
to
my
story
without
a
smile
or
a
single
word
then
he
took
me
into
a
sort
of
holy
of
holies
the
firm
had
a
secret
treasure
house
at
the
back
of
the
warehouse
filled
with
a
marvellous
collection
of
curios
turned
on
the
electric
light
what
an
amazing
anachronism
it
seemed
and
there
smiling
at
me
was
the
other
image
we
looted
from
the
temple
and
which
had
been
stolen
from
the
train
the
one
they
called
the
soul
my
ethical
sense
sir
bertram
observed
in
the
question
of
and
tuum
has
always
been
a
little
elastic
but
did
you
possibly
suggest
that
he
was
a
buyer
of
stolen
goods
my
previous
acquaintance
with
wu
ling
saved
me
from
wasting
my
breath
gregory
replied
drily
from
what
he
said
however
i
gathered
that
he
did
not
immediately
at
any
rate
intend
to
dispose
of
the
image
endacott
mentioned
in
the
course
of
conversation
borroughes
put
in
that
the
business
although
it
had
been
immensely
prosperous
was
being
wound
up
the
image
that
you
are
speaking
of
therefore
is
certain
some
time
or
other
to
come
upon
the
market
sir
bertram
rose
to
his
feet
we
will
have
our
coffee
served
in
the
library
he
suggested
then
we
can
pass
into
henry
sanctum
and
examine
our
new
possession
you
have
seen
it
yet
borroughes
have
you
not
yet
sir
bertram
they
left
the
room
crossed
a
fine
hall
and
entered
the
great
library
with
its
arched
roof
and
famous
window
a
room
of
magnificent
proportions
there
were
bookshelves
reaching
to
the
ceiling
and
opposite
the
fireplace
a
wonderfully
carved
jacobean
sideboard
on
which
coffee
and
liqueurs
were
already
arranged
they
lingered
here
for
a
few
minutes
then
with
a
brief
word
of
invitation
sir
bertram
led
the
way
to
an
inner
door
you
do
mind
our
invading
your
sanctum
for
a
minute
or
two
henry
he
asked
looking
round
towards
his
brother
by
no
means
was
the
slightly
formal
reply
i
was
expecting
your
visit
they
passed
through
into
a
much
smaller
apartment
furnished
with
the
most
complete
and
unexpected
severity
there
was
a
touch
even
of
monasticism
in
the
bare
white
stone
walls
the
high
oriel
windows
and
the
furniture
of
austere
shape
and
design
here
again
were
bookcases
containing
however
works
of
a
different
order
from
the
volumes
in
the
library
there
were
books
on
heraldry
on
china
on
silver
on
ancient
furniture
books
on
all
the
various
forms
of
art
starting
from
the
renaissance
to
the
most
modern
period
and
one
entire
shelf
was
taken
up
by
manuscript
records
each
stamped
on
the
outside
with
the
arms
of
ballaston
on
a
pedestal
of
black
oak
standing
in
the
farther
corner
of
the
apartment
was
the
image
of
the
body
henry
held
a
lamp
above
his
head
and
the
four
men
looked
at
this
new
family
possession
in
silence
as
a
specimen
of
allegorical
carving
sir
bertram
mused
it
is
a
marvellous
piece
of
work
one
could
conceive
that
this
might
be
the
countenance
of
a
man
even
of
a
god
from
whom
every
element
of
spirituality
was
entirely
absent
a
piece
of
work
of
great
constructive
merit
i
have
no
doubt
henry
ballaston
observed
as
a
subject
for
daily
contemplation
i
find
it
displeasing
most
people
would
i
think
agree
with
you
henry
his
brother
conceded
all
the
same
we
must
not
forget
the
family
fortunes
being
what
they
are
that
although
the
expert
whom
we
have
had
down
rather
scoffs
at
the
idea
of
there
being
jewels
concealed
inside
he
expressed
his
opinion
that
the
image
as
it
stands
with
as
much
of
its
history
as
one
would
like
to
make
known
is
probably
exceedingly
valuable
a
specimen
of
your
purchases
in
china
mr
gregory
borroughes
enquired
i
did
buy
it
i
stole
it
was
the
young
man
cool
reply
one
does
that
sort
of
thing
over
there
i
stole
two
of
them
my
friend
and
accomplice
had
his
throat
cut
however
and
only
one
of
the
images
got
through
to
the
coast
the
wrong
one
i
am
afraid
the
agent
looked
doubtfully
at
his
young
host
it
was
a
continual
source
of
discomfiture
to
him
that
he
never
knew
when
a
ballaston
was
in
earnest
i
give
you
all
warning
gregory
continued
that
this
image
when
separated
from
its
companion
is
a
pretty
dangerous
possession
according
to
the
legend
it
is
supposed
to
have
a
debasing
and
malevolent
effect
upon
its
owners
well
there
only
henry
in
this
house
to
be
corrupted
sir
bertram
observed
stirring
his
coffee
thoughtfully
nothing
could
make
my
reputation
in
the
county
worse
than
it
is
could
it
borroughes
the
agent
looked
uncomfortable
he
was
a
person
who
laughed
a
great
deal
but
who
was
utterly
devoid
of
a
sense
of
humour
henry
ballaston
frowned
in
troubled
fashion
your
life
is
not
a
careful
one
bertram
he
said
and
you
are
not
exactly
a
pattern
to
your
neighbours
actual
however
is
a
different
thing
no
man
yet
has
ever
found
opportunity
to
say
a
word
against
the
honour
of
a
ballaston
that
may
come
his
brother
predicted
stretching
out
his
hand
towards
the
cigarette
box
we
ca
go
on
much
longer
without
money
can
we
borroughes
it
is
a
difficult
proposition
sir
bertram
the
agent
replied
gravely
swindling
to
a
city
millionaire
is
second
nature
sir
bertram
sighed
financial
acumen
i
believe
it
is
called
a
county
squire
however
finds
few
off
already
borroughes
he
added
as
the
latter
approached
with
outstretched
hand
if
you
will
excuse
me
sir
bertram
it
a
darkish
ride
home
and
i
have
a
sale
in
norwich
and
some
accounts
to
look
through
glad
to
see
you
back
again
gregory
good
night
mr
ballaston
i
will
accompany
you
to
the
door
henry
ballaston
announced
rising
to
his
feet
i
may
possibly
not
return
he
added
turning
to
his
brother
you
will
naturally
have
a
great
deal
to
say
to
gregory
the
two
men
left
the
room
together
gregory
took
an
with
his
back
to
the
image
his
father
refilled
his
glass
with
liqueur
brandy
drew
a
box
of
cigarettes
to
his
side
and
seated
himself
opposite
his
son
these
were
almost
their
first
few
minutes
alone
well
gregory
old
man
you
could
quite
bring
it
off
then
he
observed
not
quite
sir
his
son
acknowledged
we
did
our
best
no
doubt
about
that
you
had
a
narrow
shave
of
it
as
it
was
and
all
for
nothing
i
am
afraid
sir
bertram
rose
to
his
feet
i
not
so
sure
about
that
he
rejoined
the
man
they
sent
down
from
christie
spent
over
an
hour
examining
that
image
i
never
seen
a
fellow
so
interested
in
my
life
he
had
to
give
it
up
in
the
end
but
he
was
any
more
satisfied
than
i
am
sir
bertram
had
wandered
off
into
the
other
room
lifted
the
image
from
its
pedestal
and
bringing
it
back
placed
it
upon
his
knee
the
lamplight
flashed
upon
its
black
polished
surface
to
gregory
its
expression
seemed
if
possible
even
more
vicious
than
ever
gregory
his
father
continued
thoughtfully
you
know
who
told
me
the
story
he
was
a
man
absolutely
incapable
of
falsehood
and
he
knew
what
he
was
talking
about
he
was
the
greatest
man
in
china
in
those
days
i
am
as
certain
as
i
sit
here
that
either
this
image
or
the
other
one
contains
the
whole
of
the
treasure
of
the
temple
why
not
have
this
one
broken
up
gregory
suggested
and
risk
getting
blown
to
pieces
the
young
man
shook
his
head
a
bit
too
thick
that
he
protested
i
have
a
wonderful
amount
of
faith
in
the
story
but
i
should
think
any
explosive
that
was
ever
put
inside
there
would
be
a
little
mouldy
by
this
time
i
not
so
sure
sir
bertram
reflected
those
priests
were
always
devils
at
protecting
themselves
against
marauders
besides
in
any
case
the
thing
as
it
stands
is
worth
something
let
sell
it
then
gregory
proposed
eagerly
his
father
eyebrows
were
slightly
uplifted
has
the
old
gentleman
been
exercising
his
malevolent
influence
upon
you
he
enquired
with
a
faintly
sardonic
smile
is
that
why
you
sent
it
me
home
in
such
a
hurry
gregory
frowned
gloomily
i
simply
know
that
i
detest
it
he
declared
vigorously
sir
bertram
expression
cynical
only
at
first
suddenly
developed
humorous
qualities
one
might
almost
imagine
you
terrified
by
the
superstition
my
ingénu
son
he
murmured
turning
the
image
around
and
gazing
into
its
features
gad
you
ugly
though
different
style
of
course
our
vices
are
after
all
the
vices
of
gentle
people
here
we
have
an
eloquent
personification
of
brutality
and
bestiality
in
real
life
i
doubt
whether
this
fellow
would
even
be
able
to
conduct
an
orgy
with
distinction
put
the
damned
thing
down
father
gregory
begged
suddenly
i
lived
with
it
for
three
weeks
and
i
hate
it
like
hell
sir
bertram
strolled
into
the
inner
room
and
replaced
the
image
upon
the
pedestal
then
he
came
back
to
his
son
and
laid
his
hand
for
a
moment
upon
his
shoulder
gregory
he
said
you
not
going
to
tell
me
in
cold
blood
that
you
actually
believe
in
the
superstition
of
course
i
do
believe
but
listen
i
wanted
the
other
image
johnson
and
company
wanted
mine
i
would
sell
not
likely
after
all
we
been
through
it
was
no
good
their
naming
a
price
for
theirs
because
we
had
no
money
do
you
know
what
wu
ling
the
chinaman
who
rescued
me
and
who
apparently
is
one
of
the
principals
in
the
firm
suggested
well
he
offered
to
gamble
with
me
the
winner
to
have
both
statues
how
like
a
chinaman
sir
bertram
murmured
it
was
a
good
sporting
offer
anyway
he
got
a
pack
of
cards
gregory
continued
well
he
won
i
was
to
send
this
image
back
from
the
steamer
i
swear
that
when
i
left
the
warehouse
i
meant
to
do
so
i
had
lost
fairly
i
suppose
and
it
seemed
to
me
from
the
first
like
a
debt
of
honour
i
returned
on
board
the
ship
then
i
looked
at
the
image
and
looked
at
it
and
somehow
the
thing
did
seem
so
clear
to
me
and
damn
it
i
sent
the
coolies
away
and
kept
it
anything
else
sir
bertram
asked
after
a
moment
pause
yes
you
know
that
this
man
endacott
niece
was
on
board
on
her
way
back
to
england
madame
niece
too
i
suppose
lord
what
a
dad
we
talk
about
most
things
pretty
nakedly
to
one
another
but
we
do
often
talk
about
women
one
does
his
father
murmured
listen
then
gregory
went
on
she
is
young
entirely
innocent
entirely
adorable
i
like
her
better
than
any
girl
i
have
ever
come
across
in
my
life
we
became
great
friends
then
we
danced
at
night
you
know
what
that
means
when
you
get
near
the
red
sea
and
the
canal
and
all
the
rest
of
it
of
course
you
do
we
danced
every
evening
and
all
the
time
down
in
my
stateroom
that
image
was
leering
at
me
i
began
to
feel
that
i
was
losing
control
of
myself
i
tried
to
keep
away
from
her
she
would
have
it
i
made
an
ass
of
myself
once
and
she
forgave
me
she
thought
that
she
herself
had
perhaps
misunderstood
i
was
so
ashamed
of
myself
that
fortune
or
no
fortune
i
tried
to
throw
the
damned
thing
overboard
and
what
happened
it
pitched
in
an
outslung
boat
and
was
brought
back
to
me
gregory
explained
grimly
afterwards
well
i
offended
again
sir
bertram
sighed
i
suppose
god
gave
us
the
instincts
he
murmured
but
the
devil
has
toyed
with
them
since
she
scarcely
spoke
to
me
again
gregory
concluded
except
out
of
her
sweetness
when
we
met
face
to
face
on
the
dock
at
marseilles
it
was
because
of
her
i
went
on
to
monte
carlo
instead
of
coming
straight
home
and
of
course
i
won
i
played
baccarat
at
rome
and
won
again
i
brought
home
more
pocket
money
than
i
ever
had
before
in
my
life
but
i
hate
that
image
like
hell
now
you
know
everything
sir
bertram
moved
to
the
sideboard
helped
himself
to
a
whisky
and
soda
and
returned
to
his
place
confidence
for
confidence
he
said
stretching
himself
out
comfortably
i
not
going
to
even
comment
upon
your
little
confession
gregory
because
i
do
know
what
sort
of
a
fellow
your
friend
wu
ling
was
and
i
never
seen
a
chinaman
yet
i
trust
for
five
seconds
with
a
pack
of
cards
i
bad
news
for
you
though
i
afraid
we
are
pretty
nearly
broke
we
ca
go
on
more
than
a
few
more
months
as
bad
as
that
i
do
know
how
it
is
sir
bertram
continued
but
luck
always
seems
against
the
gambler
who
takes
the
big
chances
especially
when
it
really
matters
if
any
man
knows
the
points
of
a
horse
i
do
if
there
any
amateur
understands
racing
i
do
i
bought
my
yearlings
right
i
trained
with
sam
roscoe
and
there
none
better
and
the
luck
of
old
pursued
me
this
year
just
as
it
did
last
up
to
three
days
before
the
race
little
june
you
remember
her
was
favourite
for
the
derby
when
you
left
england
you
know
what
i
was
doing
i
was
waiting
for
starting
price
i
put
on
all
i
could
at
long
odds
i
got
forty
thirty
twenty
and
at
eighteen
i
left
off
then
without
any
rhyme
or
reason
in
the
thing
she
went
lame
she
done
for
she
never
race
again
it
is
worth
telling
you
the
whole
story
i
finished
have
a
horse
left
and
i
still
owe
roscoe
a
thousand
or
two
you
know
old
mason
the
bookmaker
well
i
owe
him
seven
thousand
me
when
you
can
sir
bertram
he
said
shake
hands
on
it
and
i
shook
hands
with
him
but
gregory
god
forgive
me
i
never
paid
him
the
lands
bring
us
in
about
thirteen
thousand
taxes
five
thousand
interest
on
the
mortgages
a
little
more
than
the
rest
query
how
do
we
live
god
knows
there
was
a
short
silence
gregory
had
thrown
away
his
cigarette
and
his
hands
were
clenching
the
arms
of
his
chair
his
face
was
set
the
ghost
of
this
threatened
horror
had
risen
up
between
them
it
means
breaking
the
entail
i
suppose
he
muttered
at
last
you
and
i
can
do
it
sir
bertram
rose
to
his
feet
fidgeted
for
a
moment
upon
the
then
stooped
down
and
laid
his
hand
upon
his
son
shoulder
so
far
as
it
was
possible
for
him
to
show
emotion
he
was
showing
it
then
my
lad
he
said
i
am
the
sixteenth
baronet
you
would
be
the
seventeenth
sentiment
but
hell
all
the
same
is
it
and
mark
you
before
we
can
sign
the
papers
i
swear
that
henry
will
shoot
us
living
in
a
panic
i
feel
his
eyes
upon
me
wherever
i
go
is
there
any
other
way
out
at
all
gregory
asked
despairingly
his
father
once
more
disappeared
into
the
inner
room
and
returned
carrying
the
image
gregory
he
confided
i
believe
in
the
legend
if
the
jewels
in
this
one
they
are
in
the
other
there
was
something
in
sir
bertram
eyes
which
spoke
of
enterprise
something
definite
to
be
attempted
gregory
responded
to
it
at
once
i
go
back
to
china
and
have
another
try
if
you
say
so
he
declared
sir
bertram
glanced
round
the
room
as
though
he
feared
a
listener
his
voice
which
was
always
low
became
a
whisper
you
need
he
confided
the
soul
is
up
at
the
great
house
chapter
ii
ralph
endacott
erstwhile
professor
of
oxford
university
and
partner
in
the
great
oriental
house
of
johnson
and
company
now
an
english
country
gentleman
sat
before
french
windows
leading
out
on
to
the
lawn
sunken
gardens
and
miniature
park
of
the
great
house
at
market
ballaston
in
front
of
him
was
an
oak
writing
table
upon
which
were
pen
and
ink
and
a
coffer
apparently
of
great
age
but
attached
to
which
was
a
modern
bramah
lock
upon
the
blotting
paper
were
a
few
sheets
of
yellow
thick
paper
covered
with
weird
hieroglyphics
in
his
left
hand
a
pair
of
magnifying
glasses
the
scent
of
the
roses
from
outside
had
disturbed
him
in
the
midst
of
his
labour
he
rang
a
silver
bell
which
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
table
rang
it
a
second
time
claire
a
flutter
of
cool
white
swung
herself
out
of
a
hammock
close
at
hand
and
approached
lazily
what
is
it
nunks
dear
she
enquired
you
know
very
well
that
none
of
the
servants
can
hear
that
bell
only
me
it
was
you
i
wanted
her
uncle
declared
tell
me
child
in
what
spirit
of
idiocy
did
i
waste
all
those
years
in
a
musty
country
whose
only
charm
is
that
no
one
can
understand
it
and
no
one
ever
will
was
i
a
fool
or
am
i
a
fool
now
she
laughed
softly
leaning
against
the
side
of
the
open
window
you
were
a
fool
she
decided
i
was
a
fool
too
because
i
believe
in
england
i
did
believe
in
the
green
or
the
trees
the
flowers
the
softness
the
rest
of
it
all
you
were
too
young
to
be
foolish
he
said
it
is
only
the
old
who
can
find
the
way
to
folly
do
you
know
that
during
the
last
few
days
i
have
discovered
some
manuscripts
which
if
i
had
been
seated
in
that
den
in
the
corner
of
the
warehouse
with
the
smell
of
the
east
in
my
nostrils
and
the
soft
purring
call
of
mystery
all
the
time
in
the
atmosphere
would
have
sent
me
into
a
state
of
wild
excitement
here
i
am
gently
and
pleasantly
interested
i
have
learned
values
tell
me
about
the
manuscripts
she
begged
passing
finally
through
the
window
and
throwing
herself
into
an
close
at
hand
there
is
a
love
poem
here
he
confided
written
in
his
own
handwriting
by
an
emperor
to
a
singing
girl
i
shall
lock
it
away
it
was
not
meant
to
be
read
by
barbarians
here
are
the
details
of
the
first
plot
to
overcome
the
monarchy
and
here
he
went
on
is
a
document
more
interesting
than
any
i
have
yet
come
across
more
difficult
to
decipher
because
there
are
priestly
words
in
it
and
phrases
not
used
in
modern
chinese
however
i
have
mastered
it
so
far
as
to
know
what
it
is
about
in
this
atmosphere
it
is
strange
even
to
dream
of
it
he
paused
for
a
moment
it
was
a
lazy
hour
in
a
july
afternoon
even
the
birds
had
ceased
to
sing
but
there
were
bees
humming
amongst
the
flowers
and
the
sound
of
a
reaping
machine
in
a
meadow
on
the
other
side
of
the
red
brick
wall
every
now
and
then
the
roses
bent
their
heads
in
a
flutter
of
the
light
west
breeze
and
lent
wafts
of
perfume
to
an
air
already
sweet
with
the
odour
of
verbena
and
heliotrope
what
about
that
last
manuscript
she
asked
he
tapped
the
strange
piece
of
thick
stained
paper
beneath
his
fingers
yellow
in
places
drooping
at
the
edges
covered
with
what
seemed
to
her
to
be
meaningless
hieroglyphics
in
the
faintest
of
ink
this
he
said
is
the
letter
of
the
high
priest
of
the
temple
of
addressed
to
the
emperor
and
telling
him
what
means
he
had
adopted
for
guarding
the
secret
jewels
she
murmured
the
home
of
the
body
and
the
soul
he
nodded
these
few
lines
he
continued
smoothing
out
the
paper
thoughtfully
with
his
long
bony
forefinger
to
any
one
who
can
understand
them
might
easily
be
worth
one
of
the
great
fortunes
of
the
world
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
it
she
enquired
curiously
he
made
no
immediate
reply
first
folding
up
the
letter
and
replacing
it
in
the
coffer
which
he
carefully
locked
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
led
the
way
out
into
the
gardens
tell
me
about
that
letter
she
begged
once
more
as
they
seated
themselves
under
the
cedar
tree
part
of
the
old
story
at
any
rate
seems
to
be
true
he
confided
those
two
images
have
always
contained
a
secret
hiding
place
and
somewhere
inside
them
are
stored
the
jewels
of
the
temple
on
the
back
of
the
document
are
instructions
in
the
cipher
of
the
priests
which
as
yet
i
have
not
been
able
to
translate
i
am
not
sure
that
i
shall
ever
attempt
to
but
why
not
she
asked
wonderingly
if
i
did
he
murmured
i
should
know
how
to
appropriate
the
jewels
but
do
you
want
them
she
persisted
would
that
be
very
wonderful
he
looked
up
through
the
boughs
of
the
tree
a
worn
man
over
whose
high
cheek
bones
the
skin
seemed
tightly
drawn
in
ordinary
european
costume
he
appeared
somehow
to
have
shrunken
to
have
lost
flesh
and
a
certain
amount
of
presence
it
is
nothing
he
said
since
i
arrived
in
england
it
has
cost
me
many
a
weary
hour
to
invest
my
money
yesterday
i
heard
from
the
accountants
who
are
winding
up
the
affairs
of
johnson
and
company
and
it
seems
that
there
are
still
great
sums
to
come
all
made
in
that
strange
warehouse
she
exclaimed
there
and
in
alexandria
he
replied
i
went
out
to
china
claire
as
your
father
may
have
told
you
giving
up
a
chair
worth
eight
hundred
a
year
at
oxford
and
owning
perhaps
a
couple
of
thousand
pounds
i
became
sort
of
unofficial
adviser
to
johnson
and
company
simply
because
there
were
things
about
china
which
no
other
european
knew
i
was
very
useful
to
them
without
a
doubt
and
in
the
end
they
made
me
a
partner
now
that
we
are
winding
up
the
business
it
seems
that
my
share
is
worth
something
between
three
and
four
hundred
thousand
pounds
amazing
the
girl
gasped
here
he
continued
in
these
few
sentences
may
lie
another
fortune
i
am
an
old
man
and
i
ask
myself
what
good
could
it
do
to
me
to
place
those
secret
jewels
in
the
markets
of
the
world
to
hang
them
round
the
necks
and
the
shoulders
of
american
millionairesses
and
the
courtesanes
we
can
not
breathe
sweeter
air
than
this
or
more
delicious
perfumes
we
can
not
look
upon
fairer
scenes
we
could
not
eat
more
drink
more
or
sleep
more
for
your
clothes
and
such
pleasures
as
you
may
care
to
indulge
in
you
have
already
carte
blanche
you
are
not
one
of
those
who
will
need
money
to
buy
herself
a
husband
so
tell
me
child
what
could
we
do
with
more
money
i
can
think
of
nothing
she
acknowledged
then
for
the
moment
at
any
rate
we
will
let
the
fortune
remain
where
it
is
he
decided
and
keep
our
fingers
unstained
from
sacrilege
is
this
a
fairy
prince
claire
or
a
very
handsome
young
man
in
grey
tweeds
she
drew
a
little
fluttering
breath
her
fingers
closed
over
his
nunks
she
said
it
is
gregory
ballaston
that
is
a
young
man
her
uncle
observed
with
whom
i
might
have
something
to
say
wave
to
him
claire
he
need
not
tug
at
that
bell
gregory
ballaston
hat
in
hand
and
probably
less
at
his
ease
than
on
any
previous
occasion
in
his
life
crossed
the
lawn
towards
them
claire
leaning
forward
watched
him
intently
her
uncle
with
subdued
and
somewhat
sardonic
amusement
his
attitude
towards
them
both
was
entirely
tentative
claire
offered
her
hand
which
he
took
gratefully
i
have
come
he
announced
to
welcome
you
to
ballaston
your
obvious
duty
as
our
landlord
endacott
remarked
also
offering
his
hand
pray
sit
down
gregory
dragged
up
a
wicker
chair
with
an
air
of
relief
when
you
spoke
of
settling
down
in
norfolk
he
observed
turning
to
claire
i
had
no
idea
that
we
might
possibly
become
such
near
neighbours
nor
i
at
the
time
she
answered
how
beautiful
your
house
is
i
spent
quite
half
an
hour
this
morning
looking
at
it
from
the
other
side
of
the
garden
i
hope
he
said
a
little
anxiously
that
you
are
going
to
give
us
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
there
this
evening
your
father
has
been
kind
enough
to
ask
us
to
dine
endacott
rejoined
i
have
just
despatched
a
note
accepting
with
much
pleasure
i
think
you
are
very
generous
gregory
declared
with
a
certain
contriteness
in
his
tone
the
adjective
seems
to
me
to
demand
explanation
endacott
ruminated
you
know
very
well
sir
gregory
continued
that
there
are
circumstances
which
would
have
justified
you
in
refusing
this
invitation
and
refusing
to
meet
me
anywhere
ah
endacott
murmured
that
affair
of
the
image
of
course
claire
rose
to
her
feet
gregory
waved
her
back
again
please
listen
miss
endacott
he
begged
i
want
you
to
hear
what
i
have
to
say
you
know
what
happened
she
assented
gravely
my
uncle
has
told
me
she
admitted
i
can
assure
you
sir
gregory
went
on
that
when
i
left
those
extraordinary
premises
of
yours
i
meant
to
send
you
the
thing
straight
back
i
had
one
last
look
at
it
however
and
the
longer
i
looked
the
more
uncertain
i
felt
about
the
whole
business
i
kept
telling
myself
that
it
was
a
debt
of
honour
then
i
kept
on
finding
poisonous
ideas
in
my
brain
ideas
which
i
honestly
believe
i
have
never
had
before
i
was
parting
with
perhaps
a
great
treasure
just
on
the
turn
of
a
card
a
chinaman
turn
of
the
card
too
you
do
suggest
endacott
began
i
suggest
nothing
gregory
interrupted
all
i
know
is
that
my
moral
self
if
i
may
use
rather
a
grandiloquent
term
was
completely
upset
i
locked
myself
into
my
cabin
with
the
image
soon
after
the
ship
sailed
of
course
i
know
he
went
on
this
must
all
sound
stupidly
inadequate
but
there
it
is
superstition
or
no
superstition
i
swear
that
that
image
has
an
evil
influence
i
have
proved
it
claire
looked
thoughtfully
up
into
the
trees
her
uncle
stroked
his
chin
with
an
air
of
profound
meditation
well
he
enquired
have
you
found
the
fortune
yet
not
yet
gregory
admitted
my
father
has
had
an
expert
down
and
he
can
discover
no
trace
of
any
hiding
place
in
it
endacott
smiled
very
faintly
you
must
find
that
disappointing
he
observed
after
all
your
efforts
if
the
jewels
are
not
in
this
one
gregory
said
they
are
probably
in
the
other
ah
endacott
murmured
if
it
is
not
an
impertinent
question
sir
he
proceeded
is
it
true
that
johnson
and
company
are
relinquishing
the
business
quite
true
then
the
other
image
the
other
image
is
not
for
sale
endacott
said
calmly
who
has
it
gregory
ventured
well
endacott
confided
the
members
of
the
firm
were
wu
ling
a
nebulous
johnson
and
myself
when
i
consider
he
continued
the
extreme
measures
which
you
and
your
friend
took
to
possess
yourselves
of
these
images
measures
by
the
way
which
may
be
justified
by
precedent
but
hardly
by
morality
i
can
scarcely
do
you
know
bring
myself
to
reveal
whether
it
is
the
domicile
of
wu
ling
the
possible
mansion
of
johnson
in
alexandria
or
my
very
conveniently
near
abode
here
which
might
be
indicated
as
the
scene
of
your
future
adventures
gregory
was
already
sunburnt
but
he
felt
his
cheeks
grow
hotter
well
i
suppose
i
asked
for
that
he
admitted
grimly
what
about
the
image
which
is
at
present
in
our
possession
to
whom
do
you
consider
that
it
belongs
the
firm
being
now
dissolved
endacott
mused
the
matter
perhaps
requires
reflection
i
will
answer
you
later
on
in
the
meantime
i
shall
leave
you
and
my
niece
to
better
your
acquaintance
my
eastern
habits
prevail
i
desire
to
sleep
he
made
his
way
towards
the
house
a
lank
shambling
figure
yet
not
without
a
certain
dignity
in
his
abstracted
movements
gregory
glanced
anxiously
towards
his
companion
she
remained
seated
in
her
chair
munching
some
chocolates
from
a
box
have
one
she
invited
holding
it
out
towards
him
he
declined
but
was
conscious
of
a
poignant
sense
of
relief
with
the
airy
tact
of
her
sex
she
had
demonstrated
her
position
it
was
to
be
peace
not
war
oblivion
if
not
forgiveness
what
an
extraordinary
stroke
of
fortune
it
is
he
declared
that
you
should
have
chosen
this
particular
corner
of
norfolk
to
settle
down
in
it
makes
the
world
seem
a
small
place
does
it
she
remarked
frankly
licking
her
delicately
manicured
fingers
and
placing
the
lid
upon
the
box
with
a
great
air
of
determination
it
was
my
aunt
living
here
of
course
which
decided
us
madame
he
confided
has
been
the
one
picturesque
figure
in
this
neighbourhood
for
years
she
was
always
beautiful
and
she
is
always
on
the
point
of
being
cured
i
believe
that
my
father
looks
upon
her
as
his
greatest
friend
she
is
very
attractive
claire
admitted
she
wears
the
most
beautiful
clothes
i
have
ever
seen
i
wonder
whether
it
is
a
proof
of
vanity
or
of
an
immense
sense
of
which
leads
a
woman
who
spends
her
whole
life
upon
a
couch
to
take
such
pains
with
her
appearance
if
it
be
vanity
there
is
a
leaven
of
philanthropy
in
it
he
observed
because
every
one
loves
looking
at
her
besides
i
believe
now
she
really
is
going
to
get
well
this
new
doctor
who
comes
over
from
norwich
has
performed
some
wonderful
cures
it
is
as
though
the
weakness
had
been
born
with
her
it
was
all
the
result
of
that
motor
accident
you
know
it
would
be
wonderful
if
she
got
well
claire
murmured
they
talked
for
a
while
of
trifles
the
absence
of
other
neighbours
the
country
around
when
one
gets
over
the
spell
of
this
lotuslike
existence
she
asked
him
what
is
there
to
do
here
in
the
way
of
exercise
i
mean
he
looked
down
at
the
sunken
lawn
your
tennis
court
used
to
be
good
he
said
one
of
ours
is
quite
playable
and
there
are
plenty
of
golf
links
a
few
miles
away
where
does
one
buy
horses
at
norwich
dad
will
tell
you
all
about
that
the
hunting
is
bad
my
father
is
master
of
one
of
the
packs
that
hunt
near
here
they
begin
cubbing
at
the
end
of
next
month
the
shooting
parties
will
give
you
plenty
of
exercise
too
if
you
are
fond
of
walking
i
like
all
these
things
she
admitted
a
little
more
earnestly
and
i
love
this
garden
the
peace
of
it
is
almost
stupefying
i
feel
somehow
or
other
that
i
should
like
to
grow
old
in
this
atmosphere
you
never
would
he
rejoined
she
laughed
at
him
suddenly
she
was
serious
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
in
a
few
minutes
she
said
i
must
go
in
to
see
madame
before
you
leave
though
i
want
to
ask
you
just
one
thing
what
was
the
chief
reason
which
made
you
in
the
first
instance
come
over
to
china
on
that
mad
adventure
money
he
answered
bluntly
but
why
do
you
need
money
you
have
the
most
beautiful
home
i
ever
saw
he
laughed
with
a
bitterness
which
he
took
no
pains
to
conceal
it
is
to
keep
that
home
he
explained
that
we
need
money
perhaps
you
scarcely
understand
the
troubles
that
a
certain
class
of
english
people
have
had
to
face
lately
especially
people
who
come
of
extravagant
stock
like
my
father
and
me
it
was
pure
love
of
adventure
that
took
me
out
to
china
it
was
the
hope
of
saving
ballaston
if
i
succeeded
is
it
really
as
bad
as
that
she
asked
sympathetically
worse
he
rejoined
i
believe
that
my
father
has
finally
made
up
his
mind
that
there
is
no
chance
of
saving
the
place
she
was
thoughtful
for
several
moments
affected
even
perhaps
more
than
she
realised
by
the
note
of
dejection
in
his
tone
his
enterprise
which
had
presented
itself
before
to
her
imagination
as
a
sort
of
buccaneering
feat
not
exactly
reprehensible
but
faintly
tinged
with
sordidness
suddenly
showed
itself
in
a
new
light
she
realised
alike
the
chivalry
of
it
and
the
pathos
and
how
near
he
had
been
to
success
unless
after
all
you
discover
the
jewels
she
observed
a
little
abruptly
i
am
afraid
there
is
much
chance
of
that
he
sighed
somehow
over
here
it
seems
absurd
to
take
these
superstitions
seriously
but
i
get
away
from
the
feeling
that
if
the
jewels
are
in
existence
they
will
never
be
discovered
so
long
as
the
images
are
separated
she
leaned
a
little
towards
him
the
jewels
do
exist
she
assured
him
softly
a
touch
of
the
old
frenzied
earnestness
came
back
to
him
his
eyes
glistened
not
altogether
with
cupidity
but
with
the
adventurer
pride
in
success
how
do
you
know
that
he
demanded
she
hesitated
for
a
few
moments
yet
after
all
why
should
there
be
any
secrecy
the
adventure
such
as
it
had
been
was
finished
here
in
this
quiet
backwater
of
life
there
seemed
something
grotesque
about
it
all
nevertheless
she
spoke
uneasily
almost
reluctantly
my
uncle
has
discovered
a
manuscript
she
confided
the
jewels
are
there
in
which
image
he
enquired
breathlessly
she
shook
her
head
i
can
not
tell
you
any
more
she
said
in
fact
i
do
not
know
any
more
everything
rests
with
uncle
if
you
can
persuade
him
to
let
you
have
a
copy
of
the
manuscript
or
to
tell
you
what
is
in
it
perhaps
after
all
you
will
find
yourself
rich
again
if
i
can
help
i
will
if
one
only
knew
in
which
image
he
muttered
why
what
difference
could
that
make
she
asked
smiling
if
they
are
in
yours
well
some
day
or
other
i
am
sure
you
will
be
able
to
secure
them
if
they
are
in
his
then
i
am
afraid
your
adventure
will
have
been
in
vain
the
sunlight
caught
her
hair
as
she
leaned
once
more
back
against
the
cushions
gregory
suddenly
forgot
the
jewels
he
was
uneasy
unsure
of
himself
curiously
stirred
by
an
unexpected
wave
of
feeling
his
sense
of
proportion
diminished
there
had
been
a
cataclysm
and
nothing
remained
on
earth
but
this
garden
with
its
elm
trees
and
its
odorous
cedar
and
claire
it
will
never
have
been
in
vain
he
declared
with
a
curious
little
break
in
his
tone
chapter
iii
if
at
times
endacott
seemed
a
little
out
of
his
milieu
at
ballaston
hall
that
evening
claire
on
the
other
hand
was
an
instantaneous
and
gorgeous
success
in
the
jacobean
banquetting
hall
where
she
sat
at
her
host
right
hand
her
fresh
girlish
beauty
with
its
additional
charm
of
a
constant
and
piquant
enthusiasm
seemed
in
exquisite
contrast
to
her
majestic
but
gloomy
surroundings
the
great
dimly
lit
room
the
stately
rows
of
oil
paintings
the
cumbersome
but
magnificent
furniture
impressive
not
because
of
any
intrinsic
art
of
selection
but
because
it
was
true
to
its
period
and
had
grown
old
with
the
house
sir
bertram
whose
attentions
to
the
other
sex
apart
from
times
of
necessity
had
become
rarer
with
the
years
was
before
the
evening
was
over
proving
himself
not
only
a
courteous
but
even
a
devoted
host
and
henry
who
voluntarily
never
addressed
a
woman
at
all
actually
waited
for
opportunities
to
attempt
conversation
in
his
thackerayan
but
courtly
fashion
gregory
watched
her
success
with
complacent
amusement
content
with
temporary
effacement
and
resigned
himself
to
the
entertainment
of
her
uncle
after
dinner
they
entered
upon
a
general
and
informal
exploration
of
the
house
of
the
great
picture
gallery
with
its
shining
oak
floor
and
its
circular
carved
balustrade
leading
down
to
the
hall
below
the
victorian
its
colourings
quaintly
sweet
by
the
light
of
the
lamps
its
perfume
a
fragrant
mixture
of
lavender
and
potpourri
curiously
reminiscent
of
brocaded
gowns
hooped
skirts
and
vinaigrettes
they
looked
into
the
powdering
closet
on
their
way
out
and
lingered
for
a
few
minutes
on
the
south
terrace
from
which
stretched
a
moonlit
panorama
of
italian
gardens
with
tall
cypresses
broad
walks
leading
down
to
the
lake
claire
became
almost
silent
she
and
gregory
had
drifted
a
little
apart
from
the
others
at
least
she
murmured
sympathetically
i
realise
now
how
terrible
the
very
thought
of
parting
with
your
home
must
be
it
has
been
ours
since
he
told
her
uncle
henry
could
tell
you
the
exact
date
and
the
name
and
record
of
every
ballaston
since
i
pretend
that
my
memory
is
as
good
i
never
had
much
head
for
detail
but
we
are
all
alike
in
our
love
for
the
place
i
know
i
am
very
ignorant
she
said
a
little
hesitatingly
but
your
pictures
the
gainsboroughs
and
corots
and
romneys
and
all
those
treasures
too
surely
they
must
be
worth
a
great
deal
a
very
great
deal
of
money
they
are
all
heirlooms
he
explained
just
as
the
land
is
entailed
they
belong
to
us
as
ballastons
only
we
could
not
sell
a
single
picture
i
do
know
why
i
should
tell
you
all
this
he
went
on
except
that
just
now
and
then
you
seem
to
think
that
i
was
only
an
ordinary
fortune
hunter
i
was
you
know
really
i
went
to
china
to
try
to
get
the
money
to
keep
us
going
it
may
have
been
the
wrong
way
but
it
was
the
only
way
i
was
any
good
at
we
have
the
instincts
any
of
us
for
making
money
by
legitimate
methods
you
should
do
like
so
many
young
englishmen
she
suggested
come
over
to
the
states
and
marry
one
of
our
millionairesses
he
made
a
little
grimace
we
all
even
the
worst
of
us
have
our
code
he
reflected
personally
i
would
sooner
rob
a
man
besides
she
turned
towards
the
open
windows
through
which
was
an
impression
of
the
faded
but
stately
fine
davenports
and
costly
china
with
little
pools
of
shaded
light
falling
upon
stretches
of
carpet
delicately
blue
though
threadbare
in
places
i
think
we
had
better
go
inside
she
said
with
sudden
decision
nevertheless
he
murmured
as
he
followed
her
there
is
a
they
found
the
others
in
the
smaller
library
standing
in
a
little
semicircle
round
the
image
of
the
body
they
had
evidently
only
just
arrived
for
the
door
of
the
main
apartment
was
open
behind
them
and
through
it
was
a
vista
of
liqueur
glasses
and
coffee
cups
you
are
an
authority
i
believe
endacott
upon
all
matters
connected
with
the
east
sir
bertram
remarked
to
his
visitor
endacott
nodded
he
had
adjusted
his
more
spectacles
through
which
he
was
steadfastly
regarding
the
image
i
think
he
admitted
drily
that
i
might
be
said
to
know
more
about
chinese
art
and
chinese
objets
than
any
other
man
alive
i
gather
from
my
son
sir
bertram
continued
that
you
are
acquainted
with
the
history
of
this
particular
image
intimately
was
the
somewhat
sardonic
reply
the
fellow
statue
to
this
one
the
soul
was
acquired
after
the
desecration
of
the
temple
by
the
firm
with
which
i
was
connected
in
china
their
antiquity
alone
apart
from
their
history
makes
these
twin
images
intensely
interesting
they
are
reputed
to
have
been
the
work
of
the
priest
after
whom
the
temple
was
named
and
to
have
been
fashioned
for
the
purpose
of
concealing
the
jewels
and
treasures
of
the
temple
in
times
of
danger
i
see
no
reason
to
doubt
the
truth
of
the
story
amazing
sir
bertram
murmured
endacott
proceeded
was
the
first
apostle
of
chinese
arrestment
he
preached
the
doctrine
that
china
had
advanced
far
enough
along
the
great
avenues
of
art
and
science
and
knowledge
he
looked
still
farther
ahead
and
he
saw
that
material
progress
meant
actual
retrogression
in
feeling
in
beauty
in
genuine
achievement
it
was
he
who
started
the
crusade
against
foreigners
from
an
æsthetic
point
of
view
henry
ballaston
ventured
a
little
stiffly
one
can
find
little
to
admire
in
this
very
extraordinary
piece
of
work
endacott
turned
towards
the
speaker
his
thin
lips
protruding
only
by
contrast
with
its
fellow
he
retorted
sharply
it
was
the
wish
of
the
sculptor
a
wish
which
has
been
zealously
kept
through
the
centuries
that
the
two
statues
shall
never
be
separated
each
is
the
complement
of
the
other
body
and
soul
commingled
make
one
life
the
artist
dragged
aside
the
component
parts
and
separated
them
here
in
this
one
we
have
all
that
is
gross
and
evil
unredeemed
by
any
strain
of
virtue
and
in
the
other
statue
there
is
charity
and
spirituality
without
a
trace
of
the
defiling
qualities
they
are
parted
now
perhaps
for
ever
i
can
not
say
that
i
regard
with
equanimity
the
action
of
the
person
responsible
for
this
deed
of
vandalism
there
was
a
moment
silence
endacott
voice
was
contemptuous
almost
provocative
gregory
was
on
the
point
of
speech
but
claire
fingers
suddenly
pressed
his
arm
your
point
of
view
endacott
sir
bertram
admitted
courteously
is
easily
understood
yet
i
am
afraid
that
the
spirit
of
loot
has
been
rampant
in
englishmen
throughout
history
else
the
british
empire
could
scarcely
have
existed
and
speaking
of
loot
he
went
on
we
come
to
the
one
really
serious
question
concerning
our
possession
here
do
you
honestly
believe
that
at
the
present
moment
it
is
as
it
stands
the
receptacle
for
a
portion
of
the
jewels
of
the
temple
i
certainly
do
was
the
curt
reply
again
silence
a
little
tremor
of
excitement
amongst
the
group
sir
bertram
laid
his
long
slim
fingers
upon
the
broad
shining
edge
of
the
image
but
my
dear
sir
he
pointed
out
what
possible
place
of
concealment
could
there
be
in
say
this
particular
image
examine
it
as
carefully
as
you
will
you
can
not
find
any
sign
of
a
join
or
aperture
the
chinese
have
with
justice
been
called
magicians
endacott
observed
drily
at
least
when
they
hide
they
hide
if
there
had
been
as
you
remark
any
aperture
or
join
to
be
seen
theirs
would
have
been
a
clumsy
device
at
the
best
if
the
jewels
are
there
sir
bertram
reflected
and
we
can
find
no
other
way
then
the
statue
must
be
broken
up
endacott
turned
towards
his
host
his
manner
and
expression
were
alike
displeasing
the
glance
which
flashed
from
behind
his
heavy
spectacles
was
one
of
utter
contempt
you
carry
vandalism
beyond
the
conceivable
limits
of
thought
he
declared
the
person
who
could
destroy
work
such
as
that
would
deserve
the
fate
which
would
probably
befall
him
there
are
times
sir
bertram
rejoined
when
necessity
is
compelling
let
us
turn
this
from
an
abstract
to
a
concrete
discussion
my
son
risked
his
life
to
obtain
this
image
and
the
one
which
was
unfortunately
lost
risked
it
in
the
belief
that
it
contained
jewels
of
great
value
am
i
not
right
in
saying
endacott
that
you
could
if
you
would
assist
us
in
the
matter
of
obtaining
those
jewels
i
could
endacott
replied
quietly
i
have
at
the
present
moment
a
manuscript
in
my
possession
which
i
believe
would
solve
the
riddle
you
will
not
refuse
your
help
then
sir
bertram
persisted
endacott
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
his
tone
was
acid
his
manner
brusque
to
the
point
of
rudeness
i
do
most
certainly
and
absolutely
refuse
he
said
to
have
removed
the
images
at
all
from
their
resting
place
was
an
unforgivable
action
this
spirit
of
loot
you
speak
of
presents
itself
to
me
as
an
act
of
common
robbery
i
refuse
to
countenance
it
i
refuse
my
help
there
was
a
brief
silence
awkward
yet
in
a
sense
dramatic
henry
ballaston
who
had
been
standing
a
little
in
the
background
took
a
step
forward
then
paused
the
pallor
of
his
face
was
almost
ghastly
there
were
of
fire
in
his
cold
blue
eyes
nevertheless
he
said
nothing
such
words
as
had
risen
to
his
lips
he
repressed
sir
bertram
for
a
moment
had
looked
frankly
angry
he
too
however
remained
silent
endacott
turned
his
back
upon
the
image
and
strolled
across
towards
the
may
i
be
privileged
he
asked
to
smoke
one
more
of
your
excellent
cigarettes
after
which
i
will
beg
you
to
excuse
my
niece
and
me
we
have
the
habit
of
retiring
early
sir
bertram
was
at
once
the
courteous
host
the
discussion
was
closed
i
shall
not
attempt
he
said
to
do
my
few
treasures
the
injustice
of
showing
them
by
this
light
but
i
hope
endacott
that
you
will
give
me
another
opportunity
of
asking
your
opinion
on
them
you
and
your
niece
he
added
turning
with
a
smile
to
claire
you
know
we
have
quaint
customs
in
england
he
went
on
we
have
laws
by
reason
of
which
we
become
only
the
custodians
of
all
our
treasures
there
are
pictures
here
of
great
value
and
great
beauty
and
three
generations
of
my
family
spent
fortunes
in
collecting
china
i
shall
be
very
happy
to
see
your
collection
endacott
assented
i
know
little
about
pictures
something
perhaps
of
china
my
brother
henry
is
our
showman
sir
bertram
observed
he
gives
the
whole
of
his
time
to
the
care
of
our
treasures
my
sister
lady
annistair
will
be
here
on
sunday
afternoon
you
will
perhaps
bring
your
niece
to
tea
it
would
be
a
good
opportunity
for
a
preliminary
inspection
endacott
accepted
without
enthusiasm
but
with
a
certain
measured
politeness
which
was
as
far
as
he
ever
progressed
towards
geniality
gregory
escorted
the
departing
guests
to
the
already
hall
door
claire
made
a
little
grimace
at
him
as
they
dropped
behind
for
a
moment
i
am
so
sorry
she
whispered
perhaps
he
change
his
mind
in
any
case
he
answered
softly
thank
you
for
being
sorry
he
walked
out
with
them
into
the
scented
twilight
and
claire
waved
him
another
little
farewell
as
they
rolled
off
in
the
hired
car
when
he
returned
to
the
library
he
found
his
father
and
his
uncle
both
standing
before
the
image
they
turned
at
the
sound
of
his
approaching
footsteps
there
was
something
a
little
suggestive
in
their
unnatural
silence
pleasant
fellow
your
friend
endacott
the
former
remarked
easily
it
is
much
to
be
hoped
henry
ballaston
said
in
a
low
tone
that
he
will
not
persist
in
his
present
most
unreasonable
attitude
chapter
iv
sir
bertram
very
lithe
and
debonair
in
his
grey
flannels
and
panama
hat
issued
from
his
front
door
whistled
to
dogs
who
seemed
to
come
to
him
from
all
directions
and
humming
snatches
of
music
from
an
almost
forgotten
italian
opera
stepped
down
from
the
terrace
and
strolled
across
the
park
keeping
as
far
as
possible
in
the
shade
of
the
great
oak
trees
arrived
at
the
boundary
he
vaulted
over
the
stile
exchanged
greetings
right
and
left
as
he
passed
down
the
village
street
and
turning
along
the
lane
to
the
right
pushed
open
the
gate
of
the
little
house
and
knocked
at
the
door
with
his
ash
stick
at
a
word
of
command
the
dogs
settled
down
to
watch
wistfully
for
the
end
of
their
vigil
and
sir
bertram
admitted
by
an
elderly
and
domestic
entered
the
little
hall
where
he
laid
his
hat
and
stick
upon
an
oak
chest
and
afterwards
passed
into
the
long
low
room
the
door
of
which
the
maid
had
opened
a
woman
lying
upon
a
couch
held
out
both
her
hands
long
beautiful
hands
ringless
and
almost
transparently
white
he
raised
them
to
his
lips
and
drew
a
chair
to
her
side
you
grow
more
beautiful
every
day
angèle
was
his
greeting
the
faintest
tinge
of
colour
stole
into
her
ivory
pale
cheeks
and
her
eyes
filled
with
a
very
affectionate
light
there
was
not
a
single
grey
thread
in
her
carefully
arranged
hair
yet
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
no
longer
a
young
woman
and
you
she
murmured
i
listen
here
sometimes
for
your
footsteps
and
i
look
down
the
lane
and
i
can
never
tell
whether
it
is
you
or
gregory
who
comes
you
are
a
wonderful
person
especially
considering
the
life
you
lead
she
added
with
a
little
grimace
my
dear
he
said
we
are
all
the
victims
of
predestination
it
is
such
a
comfortable
doctrine
that
i
have
embraced
it
permanently
i
am
a
ballaston
and
gregory
will
be
one
after
me
so
far
as
that
is
concerned
henry
also
is
a
ballaston
she
reminded
him
henry
he
pointed
out
is
not
an
elder
son
it
is
the
elder
sons
who
inherit
the
full
measure
of
the
virtues
and
vices
of
our
family
henry
i
admit
is
a
freak
god
bless
him
so
you
had
my
relatives
to
dine
last
night
she
remarked
tell
me
what
you
think
of
my
niece
the
most
amazingly
attractive
young
person
whom
i
have
ever
met
in
my
life
he
replied
with
what
was
for
him
enthusiasm
as
a
rule
i
find
extreme
youth
overpowering
a
mixture
of
shyness
and
precocity
you
know
she
is
certainly
beautiful
madame
murmured
presently
i
shall
get
used
to
her
and
like
to
have
her
near
me
just
now
i
find
youth
a
little
depressing
gregory
has
altered
it
is
disappointment
his
father
sighed
he
had
a
stirring
adventure
though
i
suppose
he
has
told
you
all
about
it
madame
nodded
after
all
she
said
he
brought
one
of
the
images
home
and
a
lot
of
good
to
us
it
is
sir
bertram
remarked
ruefully
there
is
only
one
man
who
could
help
us
angèle
ralph
he
nodded
silently
a
most
impossible
person
madame
sighed
his
feet
are
on
the
earth
his
head
in
the
clouds
and
his
heart
in
china
i
am
afraid
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
he
utterly
disapproved
of
gregory
enterprise
i
call
it
sir
bertram
grumbled
you
ca
say
that
jewels
collected
by
the
priests
of
a
temple
which
have
been
hidden
for
practically
a
hundred
years
belong
now
to
any
one
in
particular
i
am
afraid
i
still
have
sufficient
of
the
francis
drake
outlook
to
claim
that
they
belong
to
whoever
has
the
courage
and
the
wit
to
find
them
the
buccaneering
spirit
she
observed
with
a
faint
smile
of
amusement
you
always
had
it
my
dear
bertram
nothing
i
am
sure
except
the
most
rigid
sense
of
honour
has
kept
you
from
robbing
your
friends
i
shall
probably
have
to
end
my
days
doing
that
he
sighed
in
some
continental
spa
or
other
another
year
will
see
us
through
at
ballaston
she
took
his
hand
and
held
it
we
wo
believe
that
she
said
softly
something
must
happen
i
do
exactly
see
what
you
ought
to
have
married
she
declared
when
i
think
of
the
young
women
heaps
of
them
with
any
amount
of
money
who
were
in
love
with
you
you
ought
to
have
married
again
i
had
the
best
reason
in
the
world
dear
angèle
for
remaining
single
he
replied
we
wo
speak
of
that
she
turned
her
head
towards
the
window
and
her
beautiful
eyes
were
for
a
moment
a
little
less
clear
the
window
looked
out
on
to
a
very
pleasant
strip
of
garden
almost
of
the
cottage
variety
crowded
with
flowers
and
with
a
long
narrow
pergola
still
hung
with
roses
inside
the
room
itself
with
its
grey
walls
and
hangings
its
few
french
etchings
the
cabinet
of
choice
china
seemed
to
possess
also
some
measure
of
the
distinction
of
its
owner
bring
me
my
mirror
and
vanity
case
from
the
table
please
bertram
she
begged
smoke
if
you
will
you
will
find
your
own
make
of
cigarettes
there
he
did
her
bidding
his
head
almost
touching
the
ceiling
of
the
low
room
when
he
rose
to
his
feet
madame
busied
herself
with
a
very
exquisite
little
gold
case
peering
at
herself
meanwhile
in
the
mirror
i
have
an
idea
sir
bertram
remarked
as
he
lit
a
cigarette
that
your
brother
dislikes
me
why
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
i
suppose
he
has
every
reason
to
angèle
from
a
brother
point
of
view
and
most
other
people
too
if
any
other
person
said
that
to
me
she
rejoined
quietly
i
should
be
very
angry
with
them
indeed
you
have
given
me
all
that
i
have
had
worth
having
in
life
more
than
i
ever
dared
to
hope
for
you
give
me
now
what
keeps
me
alive
he
took
her
fingers
in
his
and
held
them
they
were
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
a
maid
who
brought
a
little
tea
table
to
her
mistress
side
a
very
dainty
affair
with
a
queen
anne
silver
teapot
and
two
sèvres
cups
thin
bread
and
butter
cream
and
lemon
miss
besant
still
going
on
all
right
he
enquired
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
again
she
is
good
after
her
fashion
madame
acknowledged
she
is
a
discontented
creature
with
queer
humours
and
the
usual
moodiness
of
the
unmarried
girl
of
thirty
god
knows
i
trying
enough
one
ca
blame
her
if
she
gets
jumpy
sometimes
she
does
her
best
and
sir
james
he
enquired
has
he
been
down
this
week
he
comes
again
on
monday
she
answered
i
am
keeping
up
everything
massage
baths
and
diet
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
think
getting
fat
anna
and
miss
besant
were
quite
out
of
breath
when
they
carried
me
to
my
room
last
night
what
do
you
think
she
threw
on
one
side
the
beautiful
lace
wrap
which
had
covered
her
and
her
eyes
looked
towards
him
with
faint
provocative
enquiry
he
passed
his
hand
along
her
arms
and
gently
over
her
body
she
had
the
figure
of
a
thin
but
graceful
child
of
fourteen
except
that
her
feet
and
ankles
were
more
beautiful
i
see
no
change
in
you
he
assured
her
during
all
these
years
illness
seems
to
have
kept
you
young
do
you
know
that
you
are
still
very
beautiful
angèle
again
the
faint
flush
the
gleam
of
softening
happiness
in
her
face
you
must
turn
my
head
please
she
begged
then
i
must
leave
off
talking
he
replied
for
you
are
fast
turning
mine
shall
i
read
to
you
de
musset
please
the
little
volume
of
later
poems
i
kept
them
for
you
he
read
for
half
an
hour
sympathetically
and
well
when
he
laid
down
the
volume
her
eyes
thanked
him
you
are
missing
ascot
she
remarked
as
he
made
preparations
for
departure
he
nodded
between
ourselves
he
confided
i
owe
my
bookmaker
just
a
little
beyond
the
limit
of
the
amount
with
which
i
care
to
allow
him
to
credit
me
i
have
a
horse
running
as
you
know
or
in
training
it
seems
to
me
i
shall
have
to
get
through
the
summer
on
golf
and
tennis
i
am
going
to
try
and
keep
the
hounds
although
of
course
it
will
be
the
last
season
poor
dear
she
murmured
and
poor
idiot
too
you
know
i
have
money
bertram
a
great
deal
more
than
i
need
i
do
spend
half
of
it
and
ralph
says
there
is
more
to
come
to
me
why
may
i
help
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
tenderly
my
dear
he
said
if
ever
the
day
comes
when
i
can
call
myself
your
husband
i
may
accept
your
bounty
until
then
well
we
wo
talk
of
such
matters
a
delicate
little
wrinkle
of
dissatisfaction
furrowed
her
brows
she
shook
her
head
at
him
you
are
terribly
obstinate
she
sighed
you
will
come
on
thursday
without
fail
he
promised
the
dogs
rose
up
from
all
sides
as
he
passed
out
he
lingered
for
a
moment
to
talk
to
the
rather
sulky
but
not
girl
who
was
cutting
some
roses
in
the
strip
of
front
garden
madame
looks
well
he
observed
i
hope
that
you
are
still
content
with
the
neighbourhood
miss
besant
i
like
it
very
much
she
assured
him
if
the
doctor
decides
to
permit
madame
visit
to
the
hall
next
week
he
added
we
shall
have
i
hope
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
there
she
thanked
him
a
little
stiffly
sir
bertram
whistled
to
his
dogs
gazed
for
a
moment
at
the
high
red
brick
wall
opposite
which
encircled
the
domain
of
the
great
house
and
with
a
little
bow
of
farewell
turned
towards
the
village
chapter
v
that
evening
endacott
in
response
to
an
urgent
summons
rose
somewhat
reluctantly
from
his
chair
under
the
cedar
tree
finished
his
coffee
and
offered
a
grudging
explanation
of
his
departure
your
aunt
has
sent
in
to
say
that
she
wishes
to
see
me
particularly
he
confided
to
claire
just
the
hour
of
the
day
when
i
like
to
rest
what
a
pity
she
murmured
shall
i
come
with
you
he
shook
his
head
no
need
for
two
of
us
to
go
on
a
fool
errand
he
grumbled
he
crossed
the
lawn
passed
down
a
gravel
path
and
opening
the
postern
gate
made
his
way
into
the
lane
which
divided
the
great
house
and
the
little
house
a
moment
or
two
later
he
was
ushered
into
you
did
not
mind
coming
ralph
she
asked
a
little
anxiously
as
a
rule
he
admitted
selecting
a
chair
close
to
her
couch
i
prefer
my
evenings
undisturbed
since
you
expressed
a
wish
to
see
me
however
i
am
here
his
tone
seemed
scarcely
propitious
she
looked
at
him
wistfully
the
years
she
decided
had
treated
him
hardly
there
was
little
of
sympathy
in
his
face
little
left
of
gentleness
almost
from
the
first
she
felt
that
her
task
was
hopeless
sir
bertram
came
down
to
see
me
this
afternoon
she
began
he
nodded
without
speech
and
waited
he
comes
down
every
other
day
when
he
is
at
ballaston
she
went
on
no
one
in
the
world
ralph
has
ever
been
so
kind
to
me
that
he
rejoined
may
be
a
matter
of
opinion
but
ralph
she
pleaded
it
is
a
matter
of
opinion
at
all
it
is
a
fact
i
ought
to
know
ought
i
look
at
me
what
am
i
but
a
poor
invalid
woman
the
victim
of
a
terrible
accident
my
limbs
have
been
almost
useless
for
years
even
now
i
can
scarcely
move
i
am
a
depressing
sight
for
any
one
what
but
real
affection
and
kindness
could
bring
him
here
day
after
day
did
kindness
he
asked
bluntly
prompt
him
to
take
you
away
from
your
husband
bertram
never
took
me
away
from
maurice
she
expostulated
maurice
left
me
left
me
for
some
algerian
dancing
girl
for
whom
he
bought
a
villa
at
cannes
and
on
whom
he
squandered
half
his
fortune
all
the
world
knows
that
bertram
brought
me
back
from
paris
a
crushed
humiliated
woman
it
was
his
fault
that
he
was
in
the
motor
when
the
accident
happened
there
have
been
different
versions
of
the
affair
endacott
declared
moodily
madame
eyes
suddenly
flashed
if
you
dare
tell
me
that
i
may
not
love
bertram
that
i
do
not
love
him
that
there
is
any
sin
in
my
loving
him
then
you
are
a
fool
she
cried
of
course
i
love
him
no
one
in
the
world
could
ever
have
been
so
wonderful
to
a
woman
as
he
has
been
to
me
his
reputation
endacott
began
ralph
she
interrupted
indignantly
you
are
too
great
a
man
to
talk
such
shibboleth
i
dare
say
he
has
been
a
roué
and
a
profligate
and
a
great
gambler
i
dare
say
he
has
squandered
his
money
has
been
reckless
and
selfish
but
do
you
understand
ralph
he
is
of
the
sort
of
men
who
could
never
treat
a
woman
badly
i
wish
i
could
make
you
understand
at
least
believe
me
that
bertram
has
treated
me
from
the
moment
we
first
met
even
when
i
was
desperate
willing
in
my
heart
to
consent
to
anything
as
though
i
were
a
thing
almost
sacred
he
kept
my
alive
i
a
broken
creature
now
but
all
there
is
in
my
life
worth
having
i
owe
to
him
endacott
moved
a
little
uneasily
in
his
chair
well
he
said
we
will
not
dig
into
the
past
it
is
scarcely
profitable
anyhow
your
message
said
that
you
wished
to
see
me
particularly
this
evening
ralph
she
begged
we
have
drifted
a
long
way
apart
but
we
were
children
together
ca
we
talk
in
a
little
more
friendly
fashion
ca
you
look
as
though
you
remembered
that
we
are
still
brother
and
sister
he
took
her
hand
a
little
awkwardly
my
dear
angèle
he
pointed
out
the
very
fact
that
i
chose
to
come
here
is
proof
that
i
remember
it
i
returned
to
england
partly
for
claire
sake
and
partly
because
i
wished
to
be
near
you
i
admit
that
i
did
not
know
that
you
were
living
in
the
shadow
and
the
lustre
of
the
ballaston
régime
but
that
is
nothing
prejudice
without
a
doubt
i
came
if
i
could
make
your
life
easier
i
would
be
glad
is
it
money
i
have
plenty
she
shook
her
head
i
want
to
save
the
ballastons
she
confided
are
they
in
any
particular
danger
he
asked
coldly
you
ca
have
lived
here
even
this
short
time
without
knowing
it
she
answered
bertram
father
was
a
great
gambler
and
bertram
himself
has
gambled
quite
true
he
has
raced
and
made
a
failure
of
it
that
also
is
true
he
has
kept
expensive
establishments
everywhere
spent
money
like
water
lived
altogether
beyond
his
means
all
quite
true
other
men
have
done
this
ralph
who
are
not
worthless
and
bertram
ballaston
is
not
worthless
every
acre
of
the
estate
is
mortgaged
now
unless
they
can
raise
money
within
the
next
few
months
there
is
nothing
left
for
them
but
to
break
the
entail
pay
their
debts
and
disappear
endacott
was
unmoved
his
indifference
apparent
would
the
world
be
any
the
worse
he
ventured
we
will
leave
the
world
out
she
entreated
it
would
break
my
heart
what
can
i
do
about
it
he
asked
after
a
moment
pause
perhaps
nothing
she
admitted
i
do
not
ask
you
to
attempt
impossibilities
what
do
you
ask
he
persisted
doggedly
bertram
believes
she
went
on
that
in
that
image
which
gregory
went
out
to
china
to
try
to
secure
is
hidden
a
treasure
secure
he
sneered
is
a
quaint
word
i
wo
argue
with
you
about
that
ralph
she
said
the
fact
remains
that
it
was
a
dangerous
adventure
for
a
young
man
and
it
was
undertaken
for
a
worthy
object
he
risked
his
life
did
he
a
dozen
times
over
perhaps
he
failed
you
know
best
what
do
i
know
he
demanded
whether
he
really
has
a
chance
of
finding
the
treasure
whether
the
story
is
true
endacott
was
silent
for
several
moments
no
longer
indifferent
gazing
into
the
lamplit
recesses
of
the
room
the
muscles
around
his
eyes
more
than
once
twitching
supposing
that
it
is
true
he
suddenly
burst
out
his
long
frame
distended
his
thin
lips
parted
so
that
his
yellow
teeth
almost
protruded
his
eyes
steely
supposing
it
is
true
that
he
has
say
a
portion
of
them
in
his
grasp
the
treasures
which
the
priests
of
have
collected
through
all
the
centuries
what
are
they
but
the
emblems
of
the
gifts
of
men
aiming
towards
spirituality
denying
themselves
to
give
to
some
shadowy
god
think
of
it
angèle
century
after
century
denying
themselves
those
poor
creatures
who
lived
with
their
heads
bent
to
the
land
feeding
like
cattle
living
and
dying
like
sheep
denying
themselves
for
the
sake
of
that
strange
vein
of
spirituality
that
runs
through
all
heathen
races
is
all
their
all
they
went
through
the
result
of
it
all
to
go
to
reinstate
in
luxury
and
prosperity
a
family
of
foreign
roués
and
gamblers
why
go
into
the
history
of
the
treasure
she
demanded
what
about
all
the
treasures
of
peru
and
mexico
brought
into
the
old
world
where
did
they
come
from
who
asks
who
cares
what
about
the
adventurers
all
the
world
over
who
wrenched
from
the
new
countries
they
risked
their
lives
to
discover
gold
and
gems
and
metals
and
brought
them
to
the
of
life
you
were
not
always
a
sentimentalist
ralph
she
went
on
after
a
moment
pause
you
know
perfectly
well
that
if
the
gems
are
there
whatever
their
history
may
be
they
are
no
good
to
any
one
hidden
and
unseen
if
on
the
other
hand
they
belong
to
any
one
any
one
family
any
one
power
they
belong
to
the
family
who
learned
of
their
existence
and
whose
son
went
out
and
risked
his
life
to
acquire
them
you
are
very
eloquent
angèle
he
observed
in
a
noncommittal
manner
every
one
who
believes
what
they
say
is
eloquent
she
rejoined
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
walked
to
the
further
end
of
the
room
abruptly
and
without
excuse
for
several
moments
he
looked
out
of
the
window
first
across
to
the
red
brick
wall
bordering
his
domain
and
then
down
the
narrow
lane
at
the
end
of
which
half
a
dozen
villagers
were
gathered
together
sluggishly
gossiping
above
the
roofs
of
the
village
was
the
sloping
park
but
the
moon
had
not
yet
risen
and
here
was
only
a
sea
of
obscurity
on
his
way
back
he
poured
himself
out
a
glass
of
water
and
drank
it
angèle
he
said
our
lives
have
lain
very
far
apart
i
have
seen
very
little
of
you
understood
very
little
of
you
did
you
love
de
fourgenet
i
have
loved
only
one
man
she
replied
and
i
have
loved
him
not
as
you
believe
for
his
unworthiness
but
for
his
worthiness
de
fourgenet
turned
my
head
for
a
week
and
neglected
me
for
years
i
loved
bertram
from
the
first
day
we
met
he
knew
it
and
never
once
took
advantage
of
the
knowledge
i
would
to
god
i
felt
convinced
he
exclaimed
almost
passionately
whether
you
tell
the
truth
or
lie
to
shield
the
man
you
love
i
tell
the
truth
she
assured
him
with
fervour
anything
there
might
have
been
between
bertram
and
myself
would
have
been
at
my
seeking
not
his
he
is
of
the
race
of
if
you
must
call
him
an
god
knows
they
exist
to
whom
women
are
sacred
endacott
thrust
his
hands
into
his
trousers
pockets
and
sank
almost
sulkily
lower
into
his
chair
it
was
as
though
he
were
being
convinced
against
his
will
well
he
confided
here
is
the
truth
as
much
of
it
as
i
know
the
ballastons
have
one
of
the
two
images
i
have
the
other
nothing
from
a
structural
and
material
point
of
view
suggests
the
presence
of
treasure
in
their
interior
and
yet
i
believe
that
the
jewels
are
there
for
years
there
has
been
deposited
with
us
a
coffer
of
manuscripts
which
came
first
from
the
summer
palace
of
the
emperor
and
afterwards
from
the
temple
of
one
of
those
manuscripts
which
i
am
now
deciphering
professes
to
give
precise
instructions
as
to
how
to
secure
the
jewels
there
are
only
a
few
passages
which
i
can
not
master
i
am
going
to
london
in
a
day
or
two
to
obtain
from
the
british
museum
a
dictionary
of
mongolian
dialects
which
is
the
only
thing
i
need
to
help
me
to
complete
certain
phrases
you
might
think
that
i
could
guess
at
them
i
can
not
because
even
the
manuscript
is
in
code
i
need
the
actual
letters
i
believe
that
the
jewels
are
in
one
or
both
of
the
images
within
a
week
i
shall
know
how
to
extract
them
she
laid
her
fingers
upon
his
arm
ralph
dear
she
begged
when
that
time
comes
you
are
wealthy
he
stopped
her
for
a
moment
the
expression
of
almost
superb
scorn
in
his
face
lent
him
an
unusual
and
unaccustomed
dignity
angèle
he
interrupted
you
do
not
understand
if
i
were
a
pauper
i
would
refuse
to
supply
the
material
needs
of
life
with
the
accumulated
offerings
of
these
peasant
worshippers
but
as
it
happens
money
is
no
temptation
to
me
i
am
already
rich
in
fairness
the
treasure
such
as
it
is
should
go
back
to
china
if
i
were
a
younger
stronger
man
the
crowning
joy
of
my
life
would
be
to
take
it
back
and
to
choose
for
myself
how
to
distribute
it
that
however
can
never
be
i
will
try
to
be
fair
from
your
point
of
view
china
has
a
claim
to
the
treasure
that
young
man
gregory
ballaston
may
be
said
to
also
have
a
claim
a
claim
which
i
should
never
have
admitted
for
a
single
moment
but
for
your
prayers
leave
it
to
me
i
will
decide
there
was
between
them
a
long
and
rather
wonderful
silence
the
church
clock
behind
the
cottages
in
the
background
chimed
twice
before
either
of
them
spoke
madame
was
lying
flat
on
her
back
her
eyes
watching
the
moon
rising
slowly
over
the
top
of
the
red
brick
wall
endacott
as
though
overcome
with
a
curious
fit
of
exhaustion
was
seated
almost
huddled
up
in
his
chair
finally
he
rose
wearily
to
his
feet
i
am
tired
angèle
he
confessed
we
understand
one
another
we
understand
and
i
pray
she
answered
grasping
his
hand
he
left
the
house
then
and
instead
of
immediately
entering
the
postern
gate
opposite
turned
his
face
towards
the
village
there
were
a
few
lights
burning
in
the
windows
of
the
irregular
row
of
houses
scarcely
a
person
in
the
street
he
walked
to
the
corner
of
the
lane
and
looked
down
the
main
thoroughfare
at
its
further
end
was
a
trough
and
a
market
cross
on
the
stone
balustrade
of
which
some
boys
and
girls
were
seated
plunged
in
eloquent
silence
from
behind
one
of
the
drawn
blinds
came
the
sound
of
a
gramophone
and
through
the
open
door
of
the
ballaston
arms
the
wheezing
of
a
concertina
up
in
the
background
some
scattered
lights
flashed
out
from
the
windows
of
the
hall
the
outline
of
which
was
not
yet
visible
endacott
retraced
his
steps
slowly
in
his
ears
was
a
faint
tinkling
of
other
music
grotesque
monotonous
yet
thrilling
before
his
eyes
a
strange
admixture
of
roofs
beneath
his
nostrils
an
odour
which
never
sprung
from
the
soils
of
norfolk
in
his
brain
a
confused
tumult
of
thoughts
claire
a
little
bored
a
slim
white
figure
in
the
violet
darkness
leaned
forward
and
waved
her
hand
as
he
entered
the
postern
gate
nunks
what
ages
you
have
been
she
exclaimed
have
you
been
with
aunt
angèle
all
this
time
not
all
the
time
he
admitted
where
have
you
been
then
she
persisted
you
look
half
asleep
he
sank
back
into
his
chair
again
he
seemed
to
hear
the
echo
of
some
tinkling
instrument
to
find
in
his
nostrils
a
perfume
more
pungent
even
than
the
perfume
of
the
cedar
tree
to
him
there
was
something
ominous
in
what
seemed
to
be
almost
a
message
of
recall
a
long
journey
he
muttered
a
little
vaguely
chapter
vi
it
was
only
after
he
had
shown
her
around
the
picture
gallery
on
the
following
sunday
afternoon
that
claire
properly
appreciated
henry
ballaston
she
listened
to
his
last
little
dissertation
stiff
perhaps
and
a
trifle
pedantic
and
yet
in
its
way
eloquent
as
to
a
supposed
romney
with
something
more
than
interest
almost
enthusiasm
here
was
a
man
who
spoke
from
his
heart
of
things
he
loved
and
a
man
whom
no
one
in
the
world
meeting
him
casually
would
have
suspected
of
possessing
such
a
thing
as
a
heart
tell
me
what
first
made
you
love
these
things
so
she
begged
she
had
seated
herself
upon
the
huge
divan
at
the
end
of
the
gallery
from
which
in
the
afternoon
light
was
a
wonderful
view
on
one
side
of
the
great
oil
paintings
which
lined
the
staircase
and
on
the
other
through
the
mullioned
windows
a
curiously
beautiful
vignette
of
the
park
with
its
beech
and
oak
trees
and
beyond
at
the
top
of
the
slope
the
famous
home
covert
i
have
had
no
other
life
he
told
her
calmly
at
eton
i
developed
no
tastes
either
for
athletics
or
affairs
at
oxford
they
spoke
of
the
church
the
suggestion
was
repugnant
to
me
i
had
some
inclinations
towards
roman
catholicism
but
the
ballastons
have
always
been
a
protestant
family
i
considered
the
army
and
discarded
the
idea
all
the
time
wherever
i
was
i
wanted
to
come
back
to
ballaston
in
the
end
i
came
back
the
old
librarian
here
had
just
died
and
somehow
or
other
i
drifted
into
his
place
that
was
years
ago
and
it
seems
almost
like
yesterday
a
wonderful
life
she
murmured
it
would
have
suited
few
other
men
he
rejoined
it
has
suited
me
i
have
activities
out
of
doors
as
well
as
within
there
is
scarcely
a
tree
in
the
park
for
instance
whose
history
i
could
not
tell
you
nor
an
acre
of
the
gardens
i
have
not
watched
through
the
winter
and
summer
i
have
helped
to
protect
the
fruits
and
flowers
from
the
frosts
and
tried
my
best
to
gather
in
the
sunshine
for
them
indoors
of
course
he
went
on
after
a
moment
pause
has
been
the
scene
of
my
real
labours
if
labours
they
can
be
called
i
have
catalogued
the
pictures
and
the
china
the
armour
and
the
various
curios
after
a
style
of
my
own
with
the
history
so
far
as
possible
of
each
of
the
masters
the
date
and
a
copy
of
such
criticisms
as
have
appeared
in
the
press
the
catalogues
you
observe
are
all
written
by
hand
she
pored
over
the
manuscript
book
which
he
had
been
carrying
turning
the
pages
and
glancing
at
the
extracts
written
with
great
care
in
a
stiff
clerkly
handwriting
why
this
must
have
taken
you
ages
she
exclaimed
there
are
similar
volumes
he
confided
the
compilation
of
those
alone
took
me
four
or
five
years
i
am
very
fortunate
in
my
tastes
because
you
see
i
am
not
an
ordinary
custodian
i
was
born
with
these
pictures
these
titians
and
corots
and
murillos
on
the
lower
staircase
and
those
others
just
as
great
but
with
lesser
names
that
hang
upon
the
side
of
the
galleries
on
rainy
days
i
have
walked
from
end
to
end
and
seen
something
different
each
day
and
each
day
of
each
year
that
is
how
i
suppose
affection
for
a
home
and
its
treasures
grows
that
is
how
at
any
rate
in
me
has
grown
up
a
great
love
for
this
house
and
all
that
it
contains
it
will
never
be
mine
i
do
not
wish
that
it
should
but
i
have
my
share
in
it
i
am
a
ballaston
and
even
if
i
were
turned
away
and
neither
bertram
nor
gregory
would
do
that
i
think
that
my
spirit
would
still
haunt
these
staircases
you
make
one
realise
she
sighed
how
we
waste
our
lives
caring
for
indifferent
things
the
choice
is
always
with
us
he
reminded
her
gently
in
youth
however
there
are
other
tastes
and
inclinations
which
it
is
as
well
for
us
to
gratify
for
instance
i
see
they
have
commenced
to
play
tennis
and
lady
annistair
is
looking
towards
the
house
shall
we
go
down
not
yet
she
begged
i
am
loving
being
just
here
tell
me
some
more
please
you
are
very
sympathetic
he
acknowledged
and
you
see
i
am
disposed
to
take
advantage
of
you
sometimes
indeed
it
is
a
relief
to
talk
of
one
hobby
bertram
loves
his
home
and
the
traditions
of
his
family
almost
as
i
do
but
he
has
lived
outside
moved
in
the
great
places
they
are
a
sentiment
to
him
whereas
they
are
a
religion
to
me
and
gregory
too
he
is
a
little
like
that
it
is
only
natural
to
me
no
sort
of
career
has
ever
appealed
i
suppose
that
is
why
i
have
filled
my
life
with
this
one
thing
we
have
only
spoken
of
and
looked
at
the
pictures
but
there
are
other
treasures
every
ballaston
for
many
generations
has
collected
china
one
day
i
must
show
you
our
collection
there
is
something
more
to
be
appreciated
there
than
its
mere
appearance
i
will
show
you
what
design
can
really
come
to
mean
what
age
can
do
to
colouring
then
you
will
laugh
at
me
perhaps
but
i
am
almost
as
foolish
about
our
cellars
i
have
watched
the
laying
down
of
all
our
clarets
mid
sherries
and
ports
and
madeiras
season
by
season
i
have
given
away
or
disposed
of
all
of
every
vintage
that
disappointed
that
is
why
every
one
in
the
county
speaks
of
the
ballaston
cellars
i
can
not
alas
bring
the
new
things
which
make
life
so
easy
and
luxurious
to
ballaston
we
have
no
electric
light
or
heating
and
i
am
afraid
you
would
laugh
at
our
bathrooms
but
there
are
some
of
our
bedchambers
which
are
wonderful
king
james
room
for
instance
with
the
rosewood
bedstead
and
original
damask
and
the
tapestries
which
were
sent
from
the
palace
has
scarcely
ever
been
touched
let
me
ask
you
something
she
begged
may
i
you
will
not
think
it
impertinent
ask
me
what
you
will
by
all
means
my
dear
young
lady
he
answered
you
have
come
here
quite
unexpectedly
but
you
have
captured
all
our
hearts
it
will
please
me
to
tell
you
anything
you
care
to
know
tell
me
then
there
is
really
any
fear
that
all
this
may
have
to
go
his
face
was
suddenly
the
face
of
an
old
man
the
primness
of
it
the
the
mouth
all
seemed
to
fall
away
together
it
was
an
old
man
looking
at
death
i
can
not
answer
that
question
he
confessed
and
even
his
voice
was
different
metallic
and
toneless
bertram
entered
life
with
great
ideas
and
unfortunately
his
wife
who
was
a
gracious
and
charming
lady
and
who
would
have
been
a
great
heiress
died
when
gregory
was
born
then
gregory
grew
up
very
much
in
the
same
fashion
as
his
father
the
war
came
and
no
ballaston
ever
knew
how
to
save
money
or
to
save
himself
at
other
people
expense
we
are
in
terrible
financial
straits
and
all
the
time
there
have
been
fresh
mortgages
i
myself
am
not
an
expert
at
business
but
i
have
spent
weary
days
and
weeks
thinking
and
adding
up
and
wondering
unless
there
is
money
soon
it
seems
to
me
that
the
lands
must
all
go
and
the
house
be
sold
up
it
would
break
your
hearts
she
said
softly
it
would
be
death
he
answered
if
i
could
save
ballaston
he
went
on
a
little
added
strength
in
his
voice
a
glow
although
a
steely
one
kindling
in
his
eyes
i
would
commit
any
crime
on
earth
i
would
kill
i
would
murder
i
would
destroy
i
would
plunge
my
soul
into
immortal
misery
to
save
the
vandals
from
the
auction
rooms
in
london
from
coming
and
laying
their
hands
upon
the
pictures
and
china
and
trees
or
the
furniture
and
tramping
about
the
rooms
where
history
has
been
made
sometimes
lately
i
have
awakened
in
the
night
and
found
myself
crying
out
with
fear
found
great
drops
of
sweat
upon
my
body
and
it
been
a
knife
at
my
throat
or
any
horror
of
that
sort
but
men
with
catalogues
little
jew
men
with
peering
at
the
pictures
fat
men
floundering
through
the
rooms
and
looking
at
the
of
my
china
through
magnifying
glasses
he
paused
suddenly
when
he
spoke
again
he
was
a
different
being
my
dear
young
lady
he
apologised
i
beg
your
pardon
it
is
not
often
that
i
let
myself
go
like
this
in
fact
to
tell
you
the
truth
it
has
never
happened
before
will
you
excuse
me
if
i
hurry
you
downstairs
now
i
know
that
they
are
waiting
and
i
must
not
monopolise
you
she
rose
to
her
feet
still
silent
curiously
indisposed
for
speech
feeling
in
her
youth
and
inexperience
that
deep
though
her
sympathy
and
even
her
understanding
she
still
had
no
words
to
offer
you
see
how
one
gets
he
concluded
as
they
descended
the
stairs
through
dwelling
on
one
subject
and
one
subject
only
i
am
a
man
with
one
idea
but
for
that
idea
i
am
willing
to
live
for
that
idea
i
would
be
quite
willing
to
here
is
my
nephew
reginald
a
little
angry
with
me
i
fear
as
the
others
will
be
for
having
kept
you
so
long
a
tall
fair
boy
gregory
younger
cousin
who
had
come
over
from
annistair
with
his
mother
met
them
in
the
hall
disconsolately
i
say
he
complained
i
think
uncle
henry
has
been
most
unfair
we
are
all
waiting
to
play
tennis
with
you
miss
endacott
no
one
will
play
another
set
until
you
come
gregory
is
fuming
the
tea
is
cold
and
mother
is
quite
convinced
that
you
have
fallen
down
an
oubliette
there
is
one
somewhere
about
the
place
you
know
you
in
disgrace
uncle
henry
i
can
tell
you
they
all
strolled
out
on
to
the
lawn
and
claire
made
her
apologies
at
the
tea
table
please
remember
my
transatlantic
weaknesses
she
begged
a
house
like
this
is
more
wonderful
than
any
museum
it
is
just
no
tea
thanks
some
lemonade
and
one
of
those
cakes
sir
bertram
who
had
been
playing
a
single
at
tennis
shook
his
racket
at
his
brother
henry
he
declared
you
are
sent
to
coventry
i
appointed
you
showman
with
considerable
and
gave
you
half
an
hour
you
have
been
away
for
an
hour
and
a
quarter
and
we
have
finished
yet
claire
insisted
i
have
had
the
most
interesting
afternoon
of
my
life
i
do
believe
there
is
another
house
like
ballaston
in
the
world
did
you
bring
home
any
treasures
from
china
gregory
his
cousin
asked
him
what
is
that
wooden
image
in
uncle
henry
room
that
about
the
only
treasure
i
did
bring
home
was
the
somewhat
grim
reply
worth
about
a
million
i
believe
if
you
knew
how
to
handle
him
a
most
object
my
dear
gregory
his
aunt
observed
it
may
be
valuable
i
hope
for
your
sake
it
is
if
you
give
much
for
it
but
as
an
ornament
it
is
absolutely
repulsive
just
what
it
is
meant
to
be
gregory
confided
it
typifies
material
fortune
cut
adrift
from
all
redeeming
inspiration
material
fortune
is
the
one
thing
which
we
do
not
associate
with
this
house
do
get
gloomy
greg
his
cousin
drawled
here
comes
my
beloved
sister
at
last
let
have
a
four
are
you
going
to
play
uncle
bertram
the
elders
sir
bertram
replied
are
going
to
watch
your
prowess
this
set
a
jeer
gregory
exclaimed
do
ever
let
my
father
take
advantage
of
you
that
way
miss
endacott
he
can
give
me
fifteen
and
owe
fifteen
and
beat
me
when
he
feels
like
it
they
trooped
back
on
to
the
tennis
lawn
played
sat
about
under
the
cedar
trees
talked
and
gossiped
until
nearly
seven
claire
excused
herself
from
playing
in
the
last
set
and
found
a
chair
near
where
henry
ballaston
was
seated
i
have
thanked
you
half
enough
for
this
afternoon
she
said
gratefully
i
am
afraid
you
must
have
found
me
very
prolix
he
rejoined
you
must
excuse
an
old
man
with
one
idea
i
think
the
man
with
one
idea
she
answered
is
the
most
satisfactory
person
in
the
world
as
a
rule
he
makes
something
of
you
spoke
this
afternoon
for
a
moment
of
sir
bertram
wife
tell
me
more
about
her
my
dear
there
is
not
a
great
deal
to
tell
he
replied
she
was
a
little
younger
than
bertram
very
beautiful
and
devotedly
attached
to
him
she
was
the
daughter
of
the
earl
of
rutland
who
has
an
estate
on
the
other
side
of
the
county
she
died
when
gregory
was
born
if
she
had
lived
eighteen
months
longer
she
would
have
inherited
a
fortune
of
nearly
three
quarters
of
a
million
pounds
it
was
very
unfortunate
was
sir
bertram
very
much
in
love
with
her
very
much
indeed
in
fact
so
far
as
i
know
he
has
only
looked
seriously
at
one
other
woman
since
and
she
too
has
come
under
the
shadow
of
a
tragedy
we
are
not
a
fortunate
family
miss
endacott
that
may
come
she
ventured
reassuringly
the
treasure
of
the
image
may
materialise
after
all
somehow
or
other
i
believe
that
it
will
my
dear
he
said
it
is
a
very
fantastic
story
for
a
man
to
believe
but
if
there
truth
in
it
if
there
should
be
truth
in
it
then
i
must
confess
that
i
am
moved
by
the
same
spirit
which
prompted
my
brother
to
conceive
the
expedition
and
gregory
to
risk
his
life
in
carrying
it
out
if
the
jewels
are
there
no
superstition
no
confused
sense
of
morality
no
fear
even
of
being
branded
as
a
would
stop
me
for
one
moment
from
taking
them
in
this
matter
i
sympathise
with
the
more
bellicose
side
of
my
family
there
was
something
almost
threatening
in
his
words
his
eyes
were
held
by
an
approaching
figure
she
looked
towards
the
which
bordered
the
park
endacott
had
just
passed
through
a
little
gate
and
was
advancing
towards
them
in
his
rather
sombre
attire
and
drooping
black
felt
hat
he
presented
a
strange
appearance
an
appearance
half
grotesque
half
sinister
with
expressionless
face
he
shook
hands
with
sir
bertram
who
came
forward
to
meet
him
although
the
sun
was
still
very
powerful
his
cheeks
were
colourless
he
showed
no
sign
of
unusual
warmth
i
regret
my
tardiness
he
said
in
reply
to
some
polite
speech
from
his
host
i
became
absorbed
in
some
work
i
failed
to
notice
the
hour
sir
bertram
led
him
away
to
be
introduced
to
his
sister
claire
was
suddenly
aware
that
her
companion
had
lapsed
into
speechlessness
his
eyes
had
followed
the
newcomer
every
movement
they
were
fixed
upon
him
now
in
a
curious
set
gaze
there
was
an
expression
in
his
eyes
and
about
his
mouth
which
for
a
moment
made
her
shiver
mr
ballaston
she
exclaimed
he
did
not
appear
to
hear
her
instead
he
seemed
to
be
muttering
something
to
himself
she
saw
his
lips
move
but
heard
no
sound
mr
ballaston
she
repeated
he
was
himself
again
he
rose
to
his
feet
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologised
i
permitted
my
attention
to
wander
the
coming
of
your
uncle
reminds
me
of
a
task
which
i
still
have
to
perform
he
left
her
with
a
little
bow
and
turning
towards
the
house
stiff
formal
precise
keeping
always
in
the
middle
of
the
path
and
ascending
the
grey
stone
steps
with
measured
tread
disappeared
a
few
moments
later
through
the
oak
doors
she
watched
him
until
he
was
out
of
sight
unaccountably
disturbed
then
gregory
came
and
claimed
her
there
was
to
be
still
another
set
of
tennis
chapter
vii
endacott
laughed
cynically
but
not
altogether
unkindly
when
claire
had
finished
her
carefully
prepared
little
speech
that
night
after
dinner
their
coffee
had
been
served
as
usual
out
of
doors
under
the
cedar
tree
and
claire
had
returned
with
her
uncle
to
the
study
still
pleading
the
cause
which
the
events
of
the
afternoon
had
made
to
her
almost
vital
he
went
at
once
to
the
sideboard
and
helped
himself
to
a
whisky
and
soda
it
is
fortunate
claire
he
said
that
i
am
a
person
of
even
temperament
fortunate
for
you
perhaps
that
i
appreciate
your
presence
here
and
your
companionship
so
much
i
have
listened
to
you
i
think
you
will
admit
with
patience
i
shall
now
be
as
frank
with
you
as
i
was
with
your
aunt
angèle
last
evening
he
took
a
long
gulp
of
his
drink
uncovered
a
tobacco
jar
and
filled
his
small
pipe
afterwards
he
exchanged
his
dinner
coat
for
a
dressing
gown
which
had
been
placed
on
a
chair
in
readiness
tied
it
round
him
and
seated
himself
at
the
writing
table
he
dragged
the
coffer
of
manuscripts
to
his
side
and
produced
the
key
from
his
pocket
he
did
not
at
once
open
it
however
he
swung
around
and
faced
claire
you
women
he
pronounced
stir
my
anger
with
these
violent
partialities
god
knows
your
aunt
angèle
has
nothing
to
love
those
ballastons
for
yet
she
in
her
pleading
was
even
worse
than
you
father
and
son
they
are
both
of
the
same
mould
selfish
intolerant
proud
good
to
look
at
if
you
will
but
parasites
in
the
great
world
of
deeds
and
thoughts
i
will
grant
them
courage
but
i
deny
them
principle
i
ask
myself
in
wonder
why
i
find
you
pleading
for
them
well
i
know
they
have
the
gifts
women
love
the
gifts
which
make
women
miserable
fools
your
aunt
angèle
is
a
fool
you
are
a
fool
i
do
think
we
are
anything
of
the
sort
uncle
she
retorted
bravely
i
ca
even
see
that
it
is
foolish
to
ask
a
perfectly
reasonable
thing
for
people
whom
you
like
sir
bertram
may
be
everything
that
you
say
i
only
know
that
i
like
him
i
do
like
bad
people
as
a
rule
but
i
like
him
and
what
about
the
son
he
demanded
his
eyes
narrowing
his
thin
but
bushy
eyebrows
coming
together
i
like
him
too
she
declared
stubbornly
i
was
very
angry
with
him
on
the
steamer
coming
over
but
since
then
i
think
that
i
understand
him
better
you
are
not
fool
enough
to
be
in
love
with
him
he
asked
she
stood
for
a
moment
without
replying
the
hand
which
was
gripping
the
back
of
the
chair
against
which
she
was
leaning
moved
convulsively
her
eyes
were
a
little
misty
her
tone
when
she
answered
almost
indignant
that
is
a
horrid
question
to
ask
uncle
she
declared
you
may
be
a
very
learned
man
but
you
know
nothing
about
girls
american
girls
anyhow
we
do
fall
in
love
we
leave
that
to
the
men
of
course
i
know
that
gregory
ballaston
is
of
the
same
type
as
his
father
and
they
naturally
are
not
the
type
which
would
appeal
to
you
but
i
like
him
i
like
to
play
tennis
with
him
i
like
to
have
him
talk
to
me
i
like
his
friends
he
treats
me
charmingly
and
i
love
dear
henry
i
have
never
spent
a
more
interesting
hour
than
i
spent
with
him
this
afternoon
he
is
delightful
a
wonderful
personality
to
me
it
is
a
tragedy
to
think
that
they
are
going
to
lose
their
home
if
the
story
of
this
treasure
is
true
and
you
can
help
them
to
get
the
jewels
why
you
you
do
want
the
money
you
said
the
other
day
that
you
had
more
than
enough
they
have
one
of
the
images
the
other
one
gregory
risked
his
life
to
obtain
you
do
want
yours
let
them
have
both
and
tell
them
how
to
get
the
jewels
endacott
puffed
at
his
pipe
steadily
he
had
the
appearance
of
seriously
considering
the
matter
you
talk
well
child
he
admitted
you
remind
me
of
your
father
you
talk
sense
too
that
pleases
me
you
shall
have
the
truth
from
me
at
any
rate
i
believe
in
the
treasure
i
believe
that
in
hours
from
now
i
shall
know
exactly
how
to
obtain
it
when
i
know
how
i
will
reconsider
the
whole
matter
impartially
i
promise
you
that
it
is
practically
what
i
promised
your
aunt
she
made
a
little
movement
towards
him
a
gesture
an
exclamation
of
gratitude
he
waved
her
back
let
me
warn
you
he
continued
my
present
inclinations
are
to
devote
the
treasure
which
i
may
discover
to
building
a
university
in
pekin
for
the
benefit
of
young
englishmen
and
americans
who
wish
to
study
the
inner
history
and
the
truth
about
the
greatest
nation
in
the
world
and
if
the
treasure
should
realise
sufficient
money
to
build
others
in
boston
and
london
for
the
benefit
of
the
young
chinese
ask
yourself
now
would
not
the
money
be
better
spent
in
that
way
than
in
handing
it
over
to
this
piratical
degenerate
family
to
gamble
away
on
horses
and
women
and
every
manner
of
extravagance
to
breed
another
generation
of
dissolute
ballastons
who
would
lead
the
same
life
and
another
very
likely
after
them
what
do
you
think
claire
the
girl
answered
without
hesitation
i
would
rather
the
ballastons
had
the
money
you
wo
argue
the
matter
i
ca
i
would
rather
the
ballastons
had
the
money
a
part
of
it
at
any
rate
belongs
absolutely
to
them
although
wu
ling
actually
won
back
the
statue
gregory
took
home
with
him
she
hesitated
this
time
but
only
for
a
moment
you
must
be
angry
with
me
uncle
but
i
have
always
had
it
in
my
mind
that
wu
ling
is
a
chinaman
and
that
he
dealt
the
cards
endacott
sat
quite
still
for
a
moment
gazing
at
his
niece
then
he
did
what
was
for
him
one
of
the
rarest
things
in
life
he
began
to
laugh
he
laughed
until
the
tears
stood
in
his
eyes
until
he
was
compelled
to
remove
his
spectacles
and
wipe
them
when
he
had
finished
he
took
another
gulp
of
his
whisky
and
soda
claire
he
said
you
please
me
you
have
done
your
cause
no
harm
at
any
rate
now
listen
andrews
and
the
servants
know
but
i
forgot
to
tell
you
i
am
leaving
for
london
by
the
train
in
the
morning
going
to
london
she
exclaimed
his
face
now
that
the
fit
of
mirth
had
passed
seemed
unnaturally
stern
and
strained
there
is
still
one
visit
which
i
must
pay
to
the
british
museum
he
confided
one
sentence
alone
which
troubles
me
i
know
where
to
look
for
the
key
however
i
shall
return
by
the
five
train
as
i
have
promised
you
i
will
then
so
soon
as
i
am
sure
of
the
treasure
make
up
my
mind
as
to
its
disposition
you
had
better
go
to
bed
now
let
me
repeat
that
you
have
done
your
cause
no
harm
by
our
conversation
this
evening
on
the
contrary
you
have
probably
done
good
but
i
wish
now
to
be
alone
good
night
she
came
over
and
kissed
him
thankful
for
that
episode
of
humour
somehow
or
other
aware
of
a
vein
of
more
complete
humanity
in
him
during
the
last
hour
he
accepted
her
salute
perfunctorily
patted
her
hand
and
waved
her
towards
the
door
as
soon
as
she
had
departed
he
turned
the
key
in
the
coffer
for
at
least
a
couple
of
hours
endacott
worked
in
peculiar
fashion
stretched
out
before
him
was
the
sheet
of
paper
upon
which
he
was
writing
above
it
the
manuscript
yellowed
with
age
which
he
was
continually
studying
on
his
left
were
the
chinese
dictionary
a
manuscript
dictionary
of
phrases
having
the
appearance
of
great
age
and
a
collection
of
notes
mostly
compiled
at
the
british
museum
and
secured
with
a
paper
fastener
on
the
sheet
in
front
of
him
were
set
out
the
letters
of
the
chinese
alphabet
at
times
he
slowly
transposed
these
one
whole
sentence
had
already
taken
to
itself
concrete
shape
then
in
the
midst
of
his
labours
he
suddenly
paused
his
pen
remained
stiff
his
head
was
upraised
he
listened
outside
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
breathless
calm
of
a
hot
summer
night
had
formed
the
background
for
a
slight
noise
the
faint
rattle
of
a
pebble
displaced
a
footstep
it
almost
seemed
he
listened
again
the
night
though
light
enough
was
moonless
and
he
could
only
see
a
few
yards
through
the
window
he
opened
the
drawer
of
his
bureau
thrust
his
hand
into
its
furthermost
recesses
and
drew
out
a
small
revolver
then
he
rose
stealthily
to
his
feet
and
hesitated
he
had
not
passed
the
greater
part
of
his
life
in
an
undisciplined
country
without
learning
certain
precautions
to
stand
in
front
of
that
window
was
to
expose
himself
a
clearly
defined
mark
for
assault
if
indeed
there
should
be
marauders
about
he
leaned
over
and
turned
out
the
electric
light
crossed
the
room
swiftly
with
the
revolver
in
his
hand
and
passed
through
the
window
into
the
garden
he
stood
still
listening
with
his
back
to
the
wall
there
was
an
owl
calling
plaintively
in
the
little
grove
of
trees
between
the
miniature
park
and
the
kitchen
garden
then
silence
the
faint
barking
of
a
dog
a
long
way
off
silence
again
and
at
no
time
anything
unusual
to
be
seen
nevertheless
he
lingered
pebbles
can
scarcely
become
detached
without
human
agency
his
eyes
tried
to
pierce
the
shadows
there
was
a
dark
shrub
near
the
wire
fence
or
was
it
a
shrub
he
was
suddenly
convinced
that
it
was
the
stooping
figure
of
a
man
he
started
forward
crossing
the
lawn
with
swift
footsteps
which
gradually
slackened
as
he
grew
nearer
he
was
disillusioned
the
shrub
took
to
itself
shape
its
similitude
to
a
man
disappeared
he
stood
and
looked
around
him
behind
was
the
gloomy
outline
of
the
house
with
one
light
burning
in
a
top
window
from
the
servants
quarters
of
the
village
one
or
two
roof
tops
alone
were
visible
but
the
lights
had
long
since
been
extinguished
around
him
was
a
dimly
seen
vista
of
trees
and
shrubs
and
flower
beds
a
perfume
in
the
air
but
silence
he
walked
slowly
towards
the
house
the
butt
of
his
revolver
still
gripped
firmly
in
his
hand
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
nor
any
sound
to
kindle
anxiety
yet
he
was
never
devoid
of
that
uncatalogued
sense
which
bespeaks
the
close
presence
of
something
concealed
something
inimical
he
took
to
walking
in
circles
he
was
imagining
always
some
one
stalking
him
from
the
rear
he
reached
the
study
windows
however
without
tangible
sign
of
any
intruder
he
pushed
them
open
and
entered
the
room
was
in
darkness
he
found
his
way
to
the
switch
and
turned
on
the
light
instantly
all
his
vague
premonitions
materialised
the
papers
upon
his
desk
were
in
disorder
the
curtain
in
front
of
the
soul
had
been
dragged
aside
although
the
image
still
remained
there
smiling
down
upon
him
he
switched
on
another
light
and
looked
round
the
room
searchingly
his
firmly
held
revolver
following
his
eyes
the
room
was
empty
he
looked
towards
the
window
almost
at
that
moment
he
heard
the
soft
and
closing
of
the
gate
leading
from
the
back
avenue
the
intruder
had
apparently
taken
alarm
and
departed
chapter
viii
gregory
on
presenting
himself
at
the
great
house
on
the
following
morning
received
the
news
of
endacott
absence
with
marked
interest
gone
to
london
has
he
he
observed
that
means
that
you
left
alone
for
the
day
scarcely
a
tragedy
she
smiled
there
my
aunt
across
the
way
whom
i
must
go
in
and
see
some
time
a
perfectly
delightful
new
piano
that
only
arrived
this
morning
dozens
of
books
to
read
and
if
i
feel
energetic
enough
i
am
going
to
practise
mashie
shots
with
the
club
you
gave
me
a
thoroughly
selfish
programme
he
pronounced
why
selfish
because
it
is
a
solitary
one
improve
upon
it
then
she
suggested
easily
he
assented
i
brought
my
round
anyhow
hoping
for
the
best
but
with
your
uncle
away
the
thing
is
preordained
i
have
given
you
six
lessons
at
golf
in
the
park
you
doing
thundering
well
but
not
well
enough
let
go
to
some
real
golf
links
she
considered
the
matter
where
she
enquired
cromer
he
answered
promptly
it
may
be
rather
crowded
there
but
we
shall
arrive
late
we
can
choose
two
or
three
vacant
holes
have
some
lunch
at
the
club
house
and
motor
home
another
way
i
should
love
it
she
acquiesced
enthusiastically
i
go
and
tune
up
the
old
bus
while
you
get
ready
he
suggested
it
was
a
day
which
she
never
forgot
a
day
when
all
the
little
things
went
right
into
which
no
jarring
note
of
incident
or
conversation
was
ever
introduced
when
the
sun
shone
when
everything
which
happened
seemed
to
become
an
aid
to
further
content
they
motored
lazily
along
the
country
lanes
to
the
links
where
gregory
was
obliged
to
go
and
fetch
the
professional
to
see
his
amazing
pupil
afterwards
they
selected
clubs
lunched
sat
on
the
terrace
for
a
time
and
motored
by
a
devious
way
homewards
a
mile
or
so
from
ballaston
just
inside
the
park
crossing
which
had
afforded
them
a
short
cut
he
stopped
the
car
in
the
shadow
of
a
great
beech
tree
she
looked
at
him
enquiringly
puncture
sheer
fatigue
he
rejoined
mendaciously
great
strain
driving
a
car
like
this
do
you
mind
just
for
a
moment
why
surely
not
she
answered
leaning
back
and
taking
out
her
cigarette
case
it
perfectly
delightful
here
wo
you
smoke
he
shook
his
head
not
just
for
a
moment
he
answered
looking
straight
at
the
mascot
upon
the
bonnet
of
his
car
i
want
to
talk
and
i
a
jolly
bad
hand
at
it
anyway
you
not
so
hopeless
she
assured
him
encouragingly
you
can
go
straight
on
i
help
you
out
when
it
necessary
she
spoke
lightly
enough
but
already
a
queer
little
sense
of
excitement
warned
her
to
keep
her
face
turned
away
from
his
the
things
which
he
might
say
seemed
incredible
she
was
passionately
anxious
and
yet
afraid
to
hear
them
you
see
miss
claire
he
began
i
made
a
jolly
bad
start
with
you
and
that
makes
me
extra
careful
i
never
thought
i
was
going
to
turn
superstitious
but
i
can
assure
you
of
one
thing
i
have
trusted
myself
alone
in
uncle
henry
room
with
that
image
since
i
got
back
i
hope
your
uncle
henry
behaviour
she
began
with
a
faint
smile
oh
do
chaff
he
interrupted
i
think
it
would
take
the
devil
himself
to
persuade
uncle
henry
to
step
out
of
the
narrow
paths
this
is
what
i
wanted
to
say
claire
he
paused
again
unrebuked
his
eyes
looked
up
the
avenue
towards
the
house
his
slim
fingers
played
nervously
with
the
steering
wheel
we
in
for
a
big
family
smash
we
ballastons
he
confided
what
little
there
is
left
when
it
comes
will
have
to
go
of
course
to
the
governor
and
to
uncle
henry
for
me
there
wo
be
anything
i
not
complaining
i
young
enough
still
i
have
wonderful
health
and
although
i
an
ass
at
all
the
things
that
money
made
out
of
i
can
ride
i
understand
farming
and
horses
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
have
made
up
my
mind
what
to
do
i
am
going
out
to
canada
canada
she
murmured
under
her
breath
yes
i
know
some
fellows
there
who
are
doing
quite
decently
i
shall
be
able
to
get
just
the
sort
of
start
i
want
now
of
course
he
went
on
under
the
circumstances
i
ought
not
to
say
what
i
going
to
say
to
you
but
i
am
going
to
say
it
all
the
same
i
asked
you
to
marry
me
once
claire
it
was
any
good
of
course
you
had
only
seen
the
rotten
side
of
me
then
but
you
understood
i
ca
ask
you
to
marry
me
but
i
want
to
tell
you
that
i
have
all
that
feeling
which
a
man
should
have
when
he
asks
such
a
thing
and
ten
thousand
times
more
than
most
men
have
he
paused
again
she
said
nothing
her
face
was
turned
even
a
little
farther
away
he
went
on
of
course
i
done
no
particular
good
in
the
world
have
been
all
sorts
of
a
rotter
from
one
point
of
view
but
i
kept
moderately
straight
about
girls
and
here
the
truth
anyhow
i
never
came
near
caring
for
one
before
and
i
love
you
gregory
she
whispered
at
the
sight
of
her
eyes
the
sound
of
her
voice
he
was
suddenly
swept
almost
off
his
feet
it
was
amazing
sweetheart
you
must
he
begged
holding
her
hand
firmly
i
know
i
doing
wrong
to
tell
you
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
to
me
that
i
would
be
doing
wrong
if
i
went
away
and
you
did
know
so
there
you
are
i
ca
ask
you
to
marry
me
but
i
going
to
work
like
a
horse
as
soon
as
i
get
away
and
if
i
have
any
of
the
luck
of
the
ballastons
they
used
to
talk
about
i
shall
only
value
it
for
one
thing
i
not
asking
you
for
anything
not
for
a
thought
even
much
less
a
promise
but
if
at
the
end
of
a
few
years
i
see
my
way
i
wonder
you
dear
thing
gregory
she
interrupted
kiss
me
at
once
you
know
i
did
mean
this
claire
he
said
a
little
remorsefully
as
he
stopped
the
car
at
the
gates
of
the
great
house
i
hoped
you
did
she
answered
demurely
idiot
he
smiled
remember
we
not
engaged
you
have
promised
anything
you
been
sweet
and
dear
and
given
me
just
the
stimulus
for
work
i
needed
supposing
she
whispered
that
you
found
the
treasure
you
might
not
have
to
go
to
canada
he
shook
his
head
gloomily
i
dare
trust
myself
to
think
about
that
he
said
your
uncle
seems
to
have
made
up
his
mind
not
to
help
us
and
i
beginning
to
lose
faith
in
the
whole
story
still
she
persisted
if
the
story
should
turn
out
to
be
true
and
uncle
believes
it
your
home
might
be
saved
and
you
would
not
have
to
go
abroad
at
all
it
would
be
wonderful
he
admitted
do
give
up
hope
then
she
whispered
uncle
was
quite
sweet
to
me
last
night
absolutely
different
he
gone
to
london
but
there
perhaps
i
ought
not
to
tell
you
just
wait
something
pleasant
may
happen
after
all
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
andrews
the
butler
she
gave
gregory
her
hand
which
he
held
for
a
moment
and
raised
to
his
lips
her
farewell
glance
lingered
long
in
his
memory
chapter
ix
endacott
although
abstracted
seemed
for
him
to
be
in
an
almost
genial
frame
of
mind
when
he
obeyed
the
summons
of
the
evening
gong
and
meeting
claire
in
the
hall
waited
to
enter
the
dining
room
with
her
a
tiring
day
uncle
she
asked
him
not
particularly
he
answered
i
made
only
two
calls
phillpots
kept
me
some
time
at
the
british
museum
or
i
could
really
have
caught
the
earlier
how
is
the
piano
i
have
tried
it
she
admitted
your
aunt
all
right
more
confessions
uncle
i
have
even
seen
her
endacott
as
he
took
his
place
removed
his
spectacles
for
a
moment
rubbed
his
eyes
wearily
and
then
looked
across
at
his
niece
what
have
you
been
doing
all
day
then
he
demanded
claire
summoned
up
all
her
courage
ballaston
called
for
me
and
i
went
over
to
the
cromer
golf
links
with
him
she
confided
i
had
a
lesson
at
golf
some
lunch
and
afterwards
we
came
home
through
blakeney
her
uncle
rather
to
claire
surprise
made
no
comment
the
service
of
dinner
appeared
to
interest
him
more
than
usual
and
he
certainly
ate
with
appetite
railway
travelling
agrees
with
me
i
think
he
remarked
i
feel
that
i
shall
enjoy
working
this
evening
after
dinner
i
shall
have
a
pipe
on
the
lawn
with
my
coffee
and
then
the
which
i
have
been
looking
forward
to
for
so
long
did
you
get
what
you
wanted
from
mr
phillpots
she
asked
him
with
a
queer
little
note
of
eagerness
in
her
tone
i
did
he
admitted
unless
i
am
very
much
mistaken
i
can
fill
in
all
the
missing
spaces
in
that
manuscript
within
an
hour
claire
you
did
come
down
again
last
night
after
you
had
gone
to
bed
did
you
or
hear
anything
unusual
she
shook
her
head
i
was
much
too
sleepy
why
he
toyed
nervously
with
some
bread
upon
his
plate
his
eyes
sought
hers
almost
furtively
just
an
idea
he
said
i
left
my
work
for
five
or
ten
minutes
and
walked
around
the
garden
when
i
came
back
my
papers
were
all
disturbed
i
did
stir
out
of
my
room
after
i
went
upstairs
she
assured
him
was
anything
missing
were
there
any
papers
there
that
mattered
as
it
happened
there
were
not
he
replied
if
it
had
been
well
it
might
have
been
different
although
a
manuscript
in
chinese
even
though
translated
as
it
will
be
would
be
scarcely
likely
to
attract
an
ordinary
thief
would
it
she
moved
in
her
chair
a
little
uneasily
i
should
think
not
she
replied
in
any
case
if
you
were
only
out
of
the
room
for
a
few
minutes
who
could
have
entered
without
your
seeing
them
just
so
he
agreed
as
you
suggest
it
might
have
been
fancy
or
a
breath
of
wind
from
outside
or
the
opening
of
a
door
you
must
sit
up
too
late
she
told
him
you
are
looking
very
tired
he
nodded
gently
all
the
work
i
have
to
do
he
said
will
be
finished
in
an
hour
afterwards
i
may
write
a
letter
while
you
go
in
and
see
your
aunt
his
sudden
fit
of
what
was
for
him
almost
garrulity
left
him
and
he
relapsed
into
his
usual
silence
punctuated
only
by
monosyllabic
replies
to
claire
remarks
he
accompanied
her
into
the
garden
however
at
the
conclusion
of
the
meal
and
whilst
they
sat
together
over
their
coffee
he
asked
her
an
abrupt
question
how
old
are
you
claire
she
told
him
last
may
you
are
a
sensible
girl
he
went
on
when
i
heard
that
i
was
going
to
have
a
niece
to
look
after
and
that
she
was
coming
out
to
china
for
me
to
take
her
to
england
i
must
confess
that
i
was
terrified
such
an
upheaval
in
my
daily
life
seemed
to
me
calamitous
i
have
been
agreeably
surprised
your
coming
has
been
a
pleasure
to
me
claire
i
only
wish
that
you
had
come
before
her
eyes
suddenly
filled
with
tears
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
spoken
to
her
in
such
a
fashion
i
am
a
poor
adviser
for
a
young
girl
he
continued
a
little
regretfully
and
i
am
afraid
that
your
aunt
is
hopelessly
prejudiced
in
the
matter
i
can
not
bring
myself
to
believe
however
that
the
society
of
this
young
man
gregory
ballaston
is
a
good
thing
for
you
i
distrust
the
family
ethics
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
he
is
hoping
through
you
to
arrive
at
the
information
which
so
far
i
have
refused
his
father
and
his
uncle
i
was
with
him
for
several
hours
nunks
and
he
never
even
mentioned
it
she
ventured
he
is
going
out
to
canada
in
a
month
or
so
to
earn
his
own
living
endacott
sighed
i
am
full
of
prejudices
he
confessed
the
last
twenty
years
of
my
life
have
been
spent
in
abstractions
have
passed
like
a
dream
away
from
the
world
which
counts
which
one
ought
really
never
to
lose
sight
of
i
should
be
an
to
any
go
and
play
something
claire
disappeared
into
the
house
and
soon
the
sound
of
her
music
drifted
out
in
little
ripples
of
melody
through
the
perfumed
stillness
her
uncle
listened
for
some
time
without
any
sign
of
pleasure
or
the
reverse
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
and
looked
up
across
the
roofs
of
the
village
over
the
green
slopes
in
the
background
to
where
a
few
lights
were
slowly
appearing
from
the
windows
of
the
hall
presently
the
music
ceased
and
claire
stole
out
to
him
she
passed
her
arm
through
his
it
is
a
very
beautiful
home
that
uncle
she
said
softly
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
sin
to
have
it
all
broken
up
a
better
race
might
follow
he
muttered
she
shook
her
head
they
belong
she
said
gently
he
turned
away
with
a
little
grunt
and
entered
his
study
for
a
few
minutes
claire
flitted
round
the
garden
there
was
a
nightingale
singing
somewhere
in
the
distance
to
which
she
stopped
to
listen
even
the
noises
from
the
village
through
the
gathering
twilight
became
almost
melodious
presently
she
passed
through
the
postern
gate
strolled
across
the
lane
and
entered
the
of
the
little
house
through
the
windows
madame
lay
stretched
upon
her
couch
listless
and
weary
she
welcomed
claire
with
only
the
ghost
of
a
smile
where
have
you
been
all
day
child
she
asked
enjoying
myself
i
am
afraid
was
the
remorseful
reply
gregory
came
and
fetched
me
and
we
went
over
to
cromer
how
did
he
seem
madame
enquired
with
a
shade
of
interest
almost
eagerness
in
her
manner
was
he
very
depressed
claire
shook
her
head
thankful
for
the
twilight
he
seemed
very
much
as
usual
she
answered
if
anything
a
little
nicer
i
enjoyed
my
day
very
much
the
only
thing
i
felt
was
that
i
was
neglecting
you
madame
made
a
faint
gesture
of
denial
i
am
very
glad
to
think
that
you
had
such
a
happy
day
dear
she
said
i
am
glad
you
came
in
for
a
moment
though
i
do
know
why
it
is
but
i
have
nerves
where
is
your
uncle
working
away
as
usual
at
his
chinese
manuscripts
claire
replied
he
went
to
london
this
morning
and
came
back
at
five
madame
nodded
i
saw
the
car
go
with
him
and
bring
him
back
i
do
know
how
it
is
but
the
sight
of
every
one
makes
me
uneasy
even
bertram
seemed
queer
he
sat
with
me
for
an
hour
this
afternoon
as
a
rule
he
soothes
me
somehow
or
other
he
frightened
me
i
feel
as
though
there
were
a
sort
of
psychological
thunder
in
the
air
aunt
you
must
let
yourself
imagine
such
foolish
things
claire
begged
everything
and
every
one
is
as
usual
uncle
as
a
matter
of
fact
was
in
remarkably
good
spirits
this
evening
can
any
one
help
fancies
and
presentiments
my
dear
who
lies
here
hour
after
hour
day
by
day
as
i
do
madame
sighed
i
know
it
is
silly
but
instinct
is
stronger
than
reason
and
bertram
at
any
rate
was
strange
every
now
and
then
he
left
off
talking
and
there
seemed
to
be
something
always
behind
his
eyes
miss
besant
entered
the
room
and
claire
called
to
her
she
began
to
make
preparations
with
firm
capable
fingers
for
moving
the
couch
claire
bent
over
and
kissed
her
aunt
no
more
morbidness
please
she
insisted
i
be
over
early
morning
i
may
have
some
news
for
you
your
uncle
has
found
what
he
wanted
in
london
then
madame
asked
claire
nodded
assent
he
told
me
a
short
time
ago
she
confided
that
in
half
an
hour
he
would
know
everything
there
is
to
be
known
she
crossed
the
lane
and
passed
through
the
postern
gate
gazing
wistfully
over
the
roofs
of
the
village
houses
towards
the
park
her
preparations
for
the
night
when
she
finally
reached
her
room
took
her
longer
than
usual
it
was
late
when
after
she
had
turned
out
the
lights
she
moved
to
the
window
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
looking
out
suddenly
the
little
reminiscent
smile
upon
her
lips
changed
to
one
of
actuality
of
real
and
instant
pleasure
the
moonlight
was
as
yet
faint
but
crossing
the
stile
which
led
from
the
park
she
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
white
shirt
for
a
moment
she
was
tempted
he
might
be
coming
even
as
far
as
the
gardens
late
though
it
was
then
she
looked
back
at
her
neatly
folded
clothes
and
shook
her
head
claire
she
soliloquised
you
a
sentimental
idiot
after
which
she
turned
out
the
light
got
into
bed
and
slept
soundly
when
she
awoke
the
sun
was
shining
into
her
room
the
thrushes
and
blackbirds
were
singing
and
there
were
sounds
of
unusual
movement
downstairs
still
only
half
awake
she
sat
up
listening
to
the
footsteps
upon
the
gravel
beneath
her
window
there
were
voices
too
muffled
yet
agitated
then
she
heard
one
word
a
dramatic
horrible
slur
against
the
background
of
the
summer
morning
dead
cold
dead
he
were
for
a
moment
she
shook
herself
she
felt
that
she
must
be
in
a
nightmare
then
she
became
conscious
of
the
reality
of
those
footsteps
below
the
renewed
murmuring
of
voices
she
sprang
out
of
bed
before
she
could
reach
the
window
she
heard
the
same
hoarse
shocked
voice
with
its
quaint
norfolk
inflexion
shot
right
through
the
head
that
what
happened
to
him
writing
there
at
the
table
with
his
papers
lying
all
over
the
place
there
a
revolver
on
the
floor
police
sergeant
cloutson
wo
have
it
touched
she
leaned
screaming
out
of
the
window
amongst
the
little
crowd
below
were
the
village
policeman
both
the
gardeners
and
wilkinson
the
clergyman
tell
me
what
has
happened
she
cried
out
frantically
they
seemed
all
stricken
dumb
tell
me
tell
me
what
it
is
she
insisted
wilkinson
turned
towards
the
front
entrance
if
you
will
put
on
a
dressing
gown
and
come
to
your
door
he
said
i
will
speak
to
you
she
met
him
halfway
down
the
stairs
her
knees
were
trembling
and
she
clung
to
the
banisters
for
support
tell
me
what
it
is
she
demanded
is
it
uncle
my
dear
young
lady
he
announced
solemnly
a
terrible
thing
has
happened
you
must
prepare
yourself
for
the
worst
your
uncle
has
been
shot
through
the
head
apparently
at
some
time
during
the
night
the
doctor
is
with
him
now
but
but
he
is
quite
dead
dead
she
repeated
mechanically
all
his
papers
are
in
a
state
of
great
disorder
the
clergyman
concluded
i
am
afraid
it
is
a
terrible
thing
to
say
but
i
am
afraid
there
is
no
doubt
that
your
uncle
has
been
murdered

the
new
tenant
of
the
great
house
installed
within
twelve
months
of
its
dramatic
vacancy
issued
one
evening
through
the
small
postern
gate
set
in
the
red
brick
wall
which
encircled
his
gardens
into
the
village
street
this
was
his
first
appearance
since
he
had
taken
up
his
residence
in
the
neighbourhood
and
he
was
consequently
an
object
of
absorbed
interest
to
such
few
loiterers
as
were
about
an
elderly
roadmender
who
was
making
assaults
upon
a
broken
piece
of
road
with
a
pickax
which
seemed
too
heavy
for
him
looked
up
curiously
and
touched
his
hat
the
postmistress
warned
by
a
subordinate
hastened
immediately
to
the
entrance
of
her
establishment
as
though
to
consult
the
church
clock
franks
the
butcher
at
the
corner
of
the
street
hurried
out
on
the
pretext
of
giving
some
parting
instructions
to
a
boy
who
was
just
starting
off
on
his
bicycle
with
a
special
order
for
the
hall
and
moles
who
kept
a
small
general
shop
and
was
reputed
to
know
the
genealogy
morals
and
predilections
of
every
one
within
a
dozen
miles
around
stared
unabashed
over
the
top
of
her
curtains
the
first
impressions
of
the
newcomer
to
be
privately
exchanged
within
the
next
hour
or
so
could
scarcely
fail
to
be
favourable
peter
johnson
appeared
to
be
a
man
a
little
under
medium
height
sturdy
with
bright
steady
eyes
humorous
mouth
brown
complexion
and
hair
inclined
to
greyness
he
wore
a
tweed
knickerbocker
suit
a
homburg
hat
he
carried
an
ash
stick
and
his
age
might
have
been
anything
between
forty
and
fifty
no
one
was
more
interested
in
their
new
neighbour
who
was
now
engaged
in
making
his
leisurely
way
along
the
village
street
than
the
three
men
in
the
bar
parlour
of
the
ballaston
arms
conscious
of
their
own
invisibility
behind
the
muslin
curtains
they
yielded
without
restraint
to
their
curiosity
he
do
seem
an
ordinary
kind
of
a
man
thomas
pank
the
innkeeper
observed
critically
a
sportsman
maybe
craske
the
grocer
suggested
appreciating
the
costume
of
the
approaching
figure
rawson
the
butler
from
the
hall
shrugged
his
shoulders
doubtfully
every
one
listened
for
his
comment
with
interest
he
was
admitted
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
person
of
considerable
experience
i
should
say
not
he
decided
he
is
wearing
the
clothes
of
a
country
gentleman
but
to
my
mind
he
wears
them
as
though
he
were
used
to
them
the
only
stranger
in
the
neighbourhood
a
young
man
of
sandy
complexion
of
silent
habits
and
with
rather
sleepy
eyes
who
had
lodgings
in
the
farmhouse
close
by
and
was
understood
to
be
a
schoolmaster
taking
a
prolonged
vacation
set
down
his
glass
and
intervened
he
too
was
watching
the
newcomer
with
some
interest
he
is
asking
for
some
shooting
farmer
kershaw
told
me
that
do
go
to
prove
nothing
the
innkeeper
declared
there
many
as
shoots
now
out
from
norwich
and
the
big
towns
that
do
know
one
end
of
the
gun
from
the
other
what
i
say
is
that
it
a
queer
thing
that
a
man
with
no
friends
around
a
solitary
man
too
by
all
accounts
should
come
and
settle
in
a
place
like
this
and
in
that
particular
house
too
mysterious
i
call
it
i
am
of
the
same
opinion
rawson
agreed
hold
on
you
chaps
the
innkeeper
enjoined
in
a
tone
of
some
excitement
he
coming
right
in
here
the
whose
name
was
understood
to
be
fielding
was
the
only
one
of
the
little
company
who
did
not
show
signs
of
embarrassment
as
the
latch
of
the
door
was
lifted
the
door
itself
pushed
open
and
the
subject
of
their
conversation
made
his
appearance
the
grocer
had
plunged
rather
too
abruptly
into
the
discussion
of
some
local
topic
with
the
butler
and
the
innkeeper
was
too
taken
aback
to
conceal
his
astonishment
at
this
unexpected
visit
johnson
however
was
one
of
those
people
who
carry
with
them
a
composing
influence
and
the
slight
awkwardness
was
of
very
short
duration
good
afternoon
gentlemen
he
greeted
them
glancing
around
with
quiet
geniality
i
should
like
a
whisky
and
soda
mr
landlord
that
right
sir
was
the
latter
prompt
reply
as
he
turned
to
his
shelf
my
name
is
johnson
peter
johnson
the
newcomer
continued
establishing
himself
in
a
vacant
i
have
come
to
live
for
a
time
at
the
great
house
very
glad
to
welcome
you
here
sir
craske
assured
him
civilly
hope
you
find
the
place
to
your
liking
sir
rawson
put
in
i
am
very
much
obliged
to
you
all
was
the
gratified
rejoinder
my
first
impressions
are
entirely
favourable
i
have
been
a
hard
worker
and
i
need
a
little
rest
so
far
as
i
can
judge
this
seems
to
me
to
be
a
particularly
tranquil
neighbourhood
there
was
for
a
moment
an
almost
awkward
hiatus
in
the
conversation
the
innkeeper
and
the
grocer
exchanged
glances
rawson
coughed
it
has
always
been
considered
so
in
the
past
sir
the
latter
acknowledged
this
being
my
first
visit
you
gentlemen
will
perhaps
join
me
johnson
invited
as
he
received
his
whisky
and
soda
every
one
accepted
the
invitation
including
the
presumed
schoolmaster
who
had
not
as
yet
spoken
johnson
observed
him
keenly
from
underneath
his
rather
heavily
lidded
eyes
are
you
a
native
of
these
parts
he
enquired
i
am
more
or
less
a
stranger
was
the
somewhat
reserved
reply
i
like
you
have
come
down
for
a
little
quiet
ca
say
as
your
manner
of
living
quiet
would
altogether
suit
me
the
grocer
remarked
cheerily
the
young
gentleman
a
naturalist
sir
he
explained
turning
to
the
principal
guest
of
the
afternoon
he
goes
moth
hunting
with
a
net
round
the
mere
side
and
across
to
cranley
swamp
at
night
that
not
a
job
as
would
suit
every
one
johnson
was
politely
interested
the
young
man
smiled
in
expostulatory
fashion
i
am
only
an
amateur
he
confessed
and
i
only
go
out
odd
nights
during
the
week
i
miss
my
sleep
too
much
you
not
be
finding
much
company
in
these
parts
i
afraid
the
innkeeper
observed
making
polite
conversation
with
the
stranger
there
not
so
many
of
the
gentry
living
round
as
there
used
to
be
johnson
showed
signs
of
interest
well
he
said
i
a
great
reader
and
i
fond
of
the
country
so
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
tell
me
something
about
my
neighbours
who
lives
in
the
long
low
house
across
the
way
from
my
garden
gate
that
what
we
do
call
the
little
house
sir
the
innkeeper
replied
it
belongs
to
a
poor
invalid
lady
who
do
seem
to
get
any
stronger
de
fourgenet
her
name
is
or
something
like
that
she
having
married
a
foreigner
but
most
of
the
folk
round
here
just
call
her
an
english
lady
but
she
have
lived
abroad
a
great
deal
according
to
her
letters
she
do
be
some
sort
of
a
titled
lady
but
she
do
seem
to
hold
to
it
herself
an
invalid
eh
johnson
enquired
sympathetically
they
do
say
sir
that
it
her
spine
the
grocer
confided
anyway
she
mostly
lying
down
some
time
ago
they
took
her
to
one
of
them
french
places
but
it
do
seem
to
have
done
her
much
good
it
was
the
butler
put
in
i
been
there
with
my
gentlemen
before
now
in
fact
it
was
through
us
i
think
that
she
went
there
did
it
do
her
no
good
at
all
some
say
it
made
a
difference
and
some
say
it
did
was
the
doubtful
reply
anyway
there
a
physician
comes
to
see
her
now
once
a
month
and
she
has
massage
regularly
from
norwich
it
looks
as
though
there
were
still
some
hope
is
she
er
inclined
to
be
sociable
her
new
neighbour
enquired
the
grocer
shook
his
head
i
afraid
she
is
disposed
that
way
sir
he
declared
she
and
the
squire
have
been
great
friends
all
their
lives
and
he
visits
her
regular
but
she
do
see
none
of
the
other
folk
round
if
she
can
help
it
that
does
sound
encouraging
johnson
commented
does
she
live
quite
alone
she
has
a
companion
the
innkeeper
answered
a
miss
besant
a
nice
young
woman
but
keeps
herself
to
herself
there
was
a
niece
too
lived
at
the
great
house
she
did
but
she
went
away
about
a
year
agone
and
she
has
been
in
these
parts
since
as
a
neighbour
johnson
confessed
with
a
little
sigh
madame
appears
to
be
a
let
hear
about
the
rest
of
the
folk
well
the
innkeeper
continued
taking
a
modest
pull
at
his
own
tankard
there
do
be
the
vicar
for
sure
but
he
bai
no
use
to
nobody
these
days
a
man
more
changed
than
he
i
never
did
see
a
sombre
silent
man
he
is
now
surely
the
grocer
confirmed
the
butler
nodded
ponderous
agreement
he
used
to
dine
with
us
once
a
week
regular
but
has
been
near
the
hall
since
not
for
eleven
months
they
say
that
he
never
stirs
out
of
his
study
now
i
was
looking
over
his
garden
wall
only
last
night
the
innkeeper
observed
it
do
seem
the
whole
place
to
be
going
to
rack
and
ruin
and
he
so
proud
of
his
garden
too
he
has
had
some
sort
of
a
loss
perhaps
johnson
suggested
none
as
any
one
knows
of
the
butler
affirmed
he
a
widower
and
have
lived
alone
ever
since
he
came
here
there
are
some
who
say
that
he
had
a
falling
out
with
the
squire
but
if
that
be
so
none
of
us
have
heard
of
it
the
squire
johnson
repeated
hopefully
and
who
might
he
be
the
butler
manner
betokened
hurt
surprise
the
squire
sir
my
master
is
sir
bertram
ballaston
of
ballaston
hall
an
old
family
the
sixteenth
baronet
johnson
was
properly
impressed
any
family
he
enquired
one
son
gregory
ballaston
then
the
squire
brother
henry
ballaston
lives
at
the
hall
with
him
the
butler
added
after
a
scarcely
perceptible
pause
not
that
he
much
company
for
any
one
though
indeed
johnson
murmured
is
he
too
a
recluse
or
an
invalid
there
seemed
to
be
a
marked
disinclination
to
discuss
the
inmates
of
the
hall
the
innkeeper
looked
out
of
the
window
craske
gazed
into
his
tankard
the
young
man
remained
still
almost
outside
the
conversation
things
up
at
the
hall
the
butler
confided
with
some
reserve
are
not
what
they
used
to
be
there
have
come
a
change
over
the
place
a
change
indeed
the
grocer
sighed
gloomily
johnson
sensed
reserves
and
prepared
for
departure
well
i
must
be
tiring
you
with
all
my
questions
he
declared
i
going
to
ask
you
one
more
though
is
it
my
fancy
or
was
this
place
market
ballaston
the
scene
of
some
sort
of
a
tragedy
some
time
ago
the
name
market
ballaston
seemed
familiar
to
me
directly
i
read
the
advertisement
but
i
could
recall
what
it
was
if
it
was
anything
serious
it
must
have
been
whilst
i
was
abroad
they
all
looked
at
him
incredulously
the
innkeeper
picked
up
a
glass
and
began
to
wipe
it
the
grocer
coughed
nervously
even
the
butler
seemed
at
a
loss
for
words
you
excuse
us
sir
craske
said
at
last
this
is
a
very
small
place
of
course
and
when
a
thing
happens
right
in
the
midst
of
us
like
what
did
happen
it
seems
to
us
somehow
as
though
the
whole
world
ought
to
know
about
it
still
there
was
a
lot
of
stir
a
lot
of
stir
in
all
the
london
newspapers
i
am
a
careless
reader
of
the
newspapers
johnson
confessed
besides
which
the
last
twenty
years
of
my
life
up
to
a
few
months
ago
have
been
spent
not
only
abroad
but
a
very
long
way
abroad
fill
up
the
glasses
mr
innkeeper
i
have
asked
you
so
many
questions
that
you
must
allow
me
to
be
host
once
more
now
tell
me
what
it
was
that
happened
here
they
all
exchanged
glances
as
though
by
common
but
unspoken
consent
the
butler
became
spokesman
there
was
a
very
terrible
murder
committed
in
this
village
sir
just
about
twelve
months
ago
a
gentleman
was
killed
in
the
night
shot
through
the
head
he
was
and
never
a
trace
of
the
murderer
from
that
day
to
this
good
god
peter
johnson
exclaimed
properly
shocked
i
am
beginning
to
remember
something
about
it
it
was
a
gentleman
of
the
name
of
endacott
from
foreign
parts
like
you
the
butler
continued
own
brother
to
madame
at
the
little
house
he
had
been
here
very
long
but
he
was
a
harmless
body
and
well
liked
he
had
dined
with
us
at
the
hall
him
and
his
niece
a
very
beautiful
young
lady
her
as
pank
spoke
of
being
also
niece
to
madame
and
it
seemed
as
though
we
were
going
to
become
quite
friendly
one
morning
there
he
was
seated
at
his
desk
where
he
used
to
work
at
nights
shot
through
the
head
and
stone
dead
and
a
box
of
papers
that
was
by
his
side
all
scattered
about
anyhow
there
was
police
come
from
norwich
and
there
was
police
come
from
scotland
yard
in
london
but
from
that
day
to
this
they
do
seem
to
have
been
fairly
outwitted
what
a
terrible
thing
johnson
exclaimed
in
a
small
place
like
this
too
where
did
it
happen
where
did
you
say
he
lived
there
was
another
embarrassed
silence
this
time
it
was
the
grocer
who
intervened
there
was
a
note
of
indignation
in
his
tone
if
the
agent
as
let
the
property
borroughes
i
suppose
it
was
said
nothing
about
it
sir
then
there
no
doubt
he
was
very
much
to
blame
the
murder
was
committed
in
the
great
house
where
you
come
to
live
endacott
and
his
niece
were
the
last
tenants
chapter
ii
johnson
subsided
once
more
into
the
from
which
he
had
risen
this
is
most
amazing
he
exclaimed
a
murder
in
the
great
house
only
twelve
months
ago
it
do
seem
most
unaccountable
sir
the
grocer
ventured
that
you
never
heard
about
it
i
was
abroad
at
the
time
and
until
a
month
or
so
ago
johnson
explained
and
it
is
astonishing
how
you
lose
touch
with
things
altogether
after
a
while
i
sometimes
did
open
an
english
newspaper
for
a
week
at
a
well
well
he
went
on
perhaps
that
the
reason
why
they
asked
such
an
extraordinarily
low
rent
for
the
house
it
the
innkeeper
observed
who
would
live
there
rent
free
not
that
i
saying
that
any
educated
person
ought
to
take
notice
of
such
he
added
hastily
it
a
fine
house
and
the
gardens
are
grand
and
i
only
hope
sir
that
you
be
comfortable
and
not
be
put
off
so
to
speak
by
a
thing
that
passed
and
gone
and
you
say
that
the
police
have
never
even
made
an
arrest
johnson
asked
incredulously
surely
that
a
very
unusual
thing
in
this
country
unusual
it
may
be
the
innkeeper
admitted
but
a
fact
it
is
all
the
same
for
weeks
afterwards
we
had
gentlemen
from
scotland
yard
almost
living
in
the
place
one
stayed
here
in
this
very
inn
and
the
questions
he
did
ask
were
surely
ridiculous
but
there
was
one
of
them
clever
enough
to
find
out
who
killed
mr
endacott
the
new
tenant
of
the
great
house
finished
his
drink
in
silence
and
rose
to
his
feet
well
gentlemen
he
observed
i
strolled
in
here
to
make
friends
with
any
of
my
new
neighbours
who
might
be
around
and
make
acquaintance
with
the
place
so
to
speak
but
i
certainly
did
expect
to
hear
anything
like
this
it
a
bad
start
i
afraid
sir
the
innkeeper
regretted
civilly
but
you
have
been
bound
to
have
heard
of
it
before
long
such
a
stir
it
did
make
the
grocer
reflected
every
morning
and
every
afternoon
there
was
a
fresh
rumour
as
you
might
say
but
not
a
single
arrest
johnson
repeated
most
extraordinary
i
hope
now
that
you
know
the
worst
as
is
to
be
told
sir
rawson
ventured
that
you
soon
settle
down
here
and
like
the
neighbourhood
johnson
inclined
his
head
gravely
i
have
no
doubt
that
i
shall
he
declared
in
many
respects
the
great
house
suits
me
perfectly
it
is
just
the
sort
of
garden
i
want
to
have
the
neighbourhood
seems
healthy
and
it
is
not
too
far
from
the
sea
i
wish
you
good
afternoon
gentlemen
there
was
a
little
chorus
of
farewells
the
new
tenant
took
his
departure
swinging
his
stick
and
though
naturally
a
little
thoughtful
after
the
news
he
had
heard
there
was
nothing
in
his
manner
to
indicate
that
he
intended
to
take
it
too
seriously
to
heart
they
watched
him
from
behind
the
muslin
curtains
until
he
opened
the
gate
which
led
into
his
gardens
and
disappeared
he
do
seem
to
me
to
have
plenty
of
courage
and
a
proper
man
for
the
neighbourhood
the
innkeeper
pronounced
wiping
up
his
counter
there
is
might
have
been
struck
all
of
a
heap
at
being
told
what
we
had
to
tell
him
any
sort
of
tenant
is
better
than
none
the
grocer
sighed
but
a
family
i
must
confess
is
what
i
was
hoping
for
rawson
as
became
his
position
maintained
a
somewhat
dubious
attitude
i
could
wish
he
observed
with
a
heavy
frown
that
he
had
given
us
some
indication
as
to
his
previous
occupation
or
station
in
life
his
coming
in
here
and
sitting
down
for
a
drink
was
but
not
exactly
usual
to
me
he
seemed
scarcely
the
sort
of
man
whom
the
squire
for
instance
would
be
likely
to
take
a
fancy
to
the
squire
be
a
great
gentleman
the
grocer
said
reverently
there
are
many
like
him
left
in
these
parts
he
not
likely
to
take
up
with
a
stranger
why
should
he
why
indeed
rawson
assented
yet
he
seemed
to
take
quite
a
fancy
to
endacott
gregory
too
paid
the
young
lady
quite
a
lot
of
attention
and
no
wonder
the
innkeeper
remarked
she
was
a
young
lady
there
ai
many
in
these
parts
could
hold
a
candle
to
her
for
looks
you
not
very
gay
just
now
at
the
hall
rawson
he
continued
the
butler
stifled
a
regretful
sigh
things
at
the
hall
were
a
great
deal
less
gay
than
he
was
prepared
to
disclose
we
generally
pretty
quiet
during
the
summer
he
admitted
the
squire
was
never
one
for
entertaining
much
before
the
shooting
i
did
think
that
gregory
being
at
home
might
have
made
a
little
difference
but
he
due
they
say
to
start
for
foreign
parts
at
any
six
gentlemen
i
wish
you
all
good
evening
there
was
a
simultaneous
of
the
little
party
rawson
ponderous
as
ever
and
grey
of
complexion
notwithstanding
his
country
life
first
made
a
dignified
exit
and
walking
a
short
way
down
the
village
street
climbed
the
stile
which
led
into
the
park
craske
crossed
the
street
and
returned
to
the
establishment
behind
the
long
shop
windows
of
which
he
and
his
father
and
grandfather
before
him
had
dispensed
groceries
and
gossip
for
the
last
hundred
years
finally
the
young
man
fielding
took
his
silent
departure
mounting
a
motor
bicycle
which
he
had
left
leaning
up
against
the
wall
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
reflected
for
a
few
moments
be
going
for
a
ride
mr
fielding
the
innkeeper
who
had
followed
him
outside
enquired
the
young
man
looked
up
and
down
the
sleepy
street
and
glanced
at
a
signboard
where
the
road
forked
i
may
get
as
far
as
norwich
he
ruminated
i
wanting
some
new
flies
a
pleasant
ride
and
all
this
evening
the
other
observed
queer
it
do
seem
these
days
to
think
of
getting
to
norwich
and
back
afore
dark
them
things
as
you
ride
have
made
a
power
of
difference
in
getting
about
the
young
man
smiled
twenty
miles
to
norwich
he
remarked
forty
minutes
taking
it
easy
yes
i
think
i
shall
run
over
there
he
swung
on
to
his
machine
which
started
at
once
and
in
three
quarters
of
an
hour
he
was
writing
out
a
telegram
in
a
post
office
in
norwich
afterwards
he
made
a
pilgrimage
to
a
sporting
emporium
in
the
main
street
and
with
the
care
of
an
expert
selected
a
fresh
assortment
of
flies
with
which
to
tempt
a
particularly
elusive
but
desirable
trout
eight
was
striking
as
he
passed
once
more
through
the
village
street
of
market
ballaston
on
his
way
back
to
his
farmhouse
lodgings
he
dismounted
outside
the
ballaston
arms
and
stood
looking
about
him
with
the
air
of
one
absorbing
to
the
full
the
gentle
atmosphere
of
peace
beauty
and
rustic
content
at
the
end
of
the
street
a
row
of
houses
mostly
of
grey
stone
with
deep
red
tiles
opened
out
into
the
little
market
place
where
an
ancient
covered
cross
stood
in
the
centre
of
a
cobbled
space
on
a
stone
trough
three
or
four
youths
and
two
young
women
were
seated
in
peaceful
and
almost
aggressive
silence
houghton
the
bank
manager
was
standing
on
the
cool
flagged
pavement
outside
his
neat
little
house
smoking
a
cigarette
and
chatting
with
foulds
the
veterinary
surgeon
who
had
just
driven
up
in
his
little
car
whilst
just
across
the
way
craske
daughter
had
stepped
out
of
the
front
door
to
water
the
row
of
geraniums
in
the
boxes
before
the
windows
from
the
great
house
set
in
somewhat
severe
isolation
behind
its
encircling
red
brick
wall
came
the
clamorous
summons
of
a
dinner
gong
and
almost
immediately
afterwards
a
similar
invitation
from
the
tinkling
of
chinese
bells
sounded
from
the
little
house
the
melody
from
the
latter
had
scarcely
died
away
before
from
the
hall
came
the
slow
booming
of
the
alarm
bell
rung
nightly
at
the
dinner
hour
the
young
man
listened
and
into
his
sleepy
eyes
there
crept
a
speculative
expression
as
they
travelled
beyond
the
village
street
beyond
the
park
up
the
great
avenue
towards
the
windows
of
the
hall
it
seemed
almost
as
though
he
could
see
into
the
very
stately
and
undisturbed
jacobean
dining
room
see
the
three
men
who
sat
together
at
the
end
of
that
desert
of
mahogany
frowned
down
upon
by
lines
of
pictured
ancestors
their
slightest
need
anticipated
by
rawson
and
his
subordinates
as
though
he
could
hear
their
languid
and
stilted
efforts
at
conversation
as
though
perhaps
he
could
see
the
ghosts
behind
their
chairs
as
though
when
he
swung
round
a
moment
or
two
later
he
could
see
into
the
more
modest
but
still
impressive
dining
room
of
the
great
house
where
peter
johnson
sat
alone
before
a
far
simpler
repast
eating
and
drinking
with
a
frown
upon
his
forehead
and
lines
about
his
mouth
no
traces
of
which
had
appeared
during
those
more
genial
moments
of
his
afternoon
visit
to
the
ballaston
arms
as
though
turning
still
a
little
farther
round
he
could
see
even
into
that
quaint
low
dining
room
of
the
little
house
take
note
of
the
invalid
with
golden
hair
and
weary
brown
eyes
who
lay
upon
her
long
chair
drawn
up
by
the
side
of
the
round
table
the
discontented
but
earnest
young
woman
who
sat
opposite
to
her
the
maid
their
sole
attendant
in
the
end
he
sighed
and
abandoned
his
reflections
he
entered
the
inn
disturbing
thereby
pank
the
landlord
in
the
middle
of
his
supper
and
drank
a
glass
of
gin
and
tonic
then
the
quick
explosions
of
his
bicycle
disturbed
once
more
the
quiet
drowsy
street
as
he
flashed
through
the
village
on
his
homeward
way
throughout
the
whole
of
that
long
summer
day
it
had
scarcely
seemed
possible
that
there
could
be
a
more
peaceful
spot
in
the
world
than
the
wide
street
the
cobbled
market
place
and
the
winding
country
lanes
which
emptied
themselves
into
the
village
of
market
ballaston
at
three
on
the
following
morning
there
was
not
only
peace
but
silence
absolute
and
complete
the
two
hundred
and
men
women
and
children
who
made
up
its
inhabitants
had
passed
into
the
land
of
ghosts
even
the
houses
themselves
with
their
closed
blinds
and
sightless
windows
breathed
the
very
spirit
of
repose
the
chiming
of
the
church
clock
notwithstanding
its
silvery
distinctness
seemed
to
carry
with
it
a
note
almost
of
apology
to
a
sleeping
world
silence
more
complete
than
ever
followed
the
dying
away
of
its
last
trembling
note
for
some
time
not
even
an
uneasy
dog
or
a
too
eager
denizen
of
the
farmyard
ventured
to
disturb
the
moonlit
pall
of
silence
then
came
the
first
sign
of
human
movement
the
small
postern
gate
set
in
the
red
brick
wall
which
surrounded
the
great
house
was
opened
noiselessly
and
peter
johnson
stepped
into
the
lane
he
stood
there
for
a
moment
or
two
perfectly
still
with
the
air
of
a
man
listening
a
hopeless
task
it
seemed
on
such
a
night
whilst
he
listened
his
eyes
wandered
up
and
down
the
street
away
across
the
churchyard
and
into
the
wood
behind
past
the
steeple
and
over
the
sleeping
country
to
the
horizon
it
seemed
however
that
if
he
watched
for
any
unusual
sight
or
listened
for
any
unusual
sounds
both
efforts
were
in
vain
after
a
few
moments
he
took
another
step
forward
and
with
the
postern
gate
still
open
stood
gazing
thoughtfully
and
watchfully
over
the
medley
of
roofs
up
the
great
avenue
beyond
to
where
the
imposing
front
of
the
hall
with
its
long
rows
of
uncurtained
windows
filled
the
background
with
a
serene
and
brooding
dignity
he
stood
there
perhaps
for
as
long
as
five
minutes
until
he
seemed
to
become
part
of
the
dreaming
landscape
a
statue
petrified
by
the
moonlight
the
only
living
figure
in
that
drama
of
repose
all
the
geniality
and
kindliness
drained
somehow
from
his
expression
a
sinister
and
watchful
figure
alien
and
inimical
suddenly
he
seemed
to
stiffen
from
the
outside
of
a
small
wood
adjoining
the
hall
flashed
a
light
little
more
than
a
of
fire
but
vivid
and
distinct
three
times
it
flashed
then
it
disappeared
peter
johnson
as
silently
as
he
had
come
stepped
back
and
vanishing
through
the
postern
gate
reëntered
his
own
domains
chapter
iii
peter
johnson
on
the
following
morning
was
indulging
in
the
harmless
occupation
of
practising
mashie
shots
with
a
dozen
golf
balls
over
some
shrubs
upon
the
front
lawn
of
the
great
house
when
morton
his
newly
engaged
butler
who
had
arrived
a
few
days
before
from
a
registry
office
at
norwich
sallied
through
the
garden
door
followed
by
a
young
lady
johnson
promptly
abandoned
his
diversion
and
came
forward
miss
besant
to
see
you
sir
the
servant
announced
johnson
without
committing
himself
to
speech
exhibited
a
certain
measure
of
cordiality
he
held
out
a
welcoming
hand
which
after
a
moment
hesitation
the
girl
accepted
i
must
apologise
for
coming
in
like
this
johnson
she
said
madame
de
fourgenet
the
lady
to
whom
i
am
companion
insisted
upon
it
i
beg
that
you
will
not
apologise
was
the
civil
reply
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
you
are
my
opposite
neighbour
then
it
seems
we
live
at
the
little
house
the
young
lady
assented
for
over
a
year
all
the
time
that
the
place
has
been
empty
in
fact
your
gardener
smith
has
been
accustomed
to
assist
our
one
servant
for
half
an
hour
each
day
cutting
wood
or
something
of
that
sort
madame
has
the
strongest
objection
to
having
a
stranger
in
the
house
or
even
in
the
garden
and
she
sent
me
across
to
ask
whether
it
were
possible
to
make
any
arrangement
by
which
we
could
continue
to
have
the
services
of
smith
for
that
time
each
day
johnson
made
no
immediate
reply
he
was
exceedingly
interested
in
the
young
lady
and
he
seemed
to
be
carrying
out
a
line
of
thought
with
regard
to
her
from
the
moment
of
her
appearance
her
expression
had
not
changed
her
tone
which
was
level
and
indifferent
was
the
tone
of
a
person
who
had
no
concern
in
what
she
said
she
spoke
mechanically
as
though
choosing
the
readiest
words
with
the
sole
object
of
concluding
an
unavoidable
task
she
was
tall
inclined
to
be
of
full
figure
paler
than
she
ought
to
have
been
living
in
the
country
with
eyes
which
seemed
seldom
fully
open
masses
of
light
brown
hair
brushed
back
from
her
forehead
and
a
mouth
whose
discontented
corners
gave
to
her
expression
a
weary
almost
a
petulant
note
no
ordinary
person
an
admirer
of
the
sex
studying
her
as
she
had
crossed
the
lawn
would
probably
have
troubled
to
look
at
her
again
johnson
however
was
not
an
ordinary
person
it
was
one
of
his
gifts
to
appreciate
people
for
what
they
were
not
for
what
they
seemed
to
be
he
realised
that
there
were
certain
exceptional
characteristics
about
the
young
woman
who
stood
waiting
for
his
reply
please
do
hesitate
to
say
so
she
went
on
half
turning
away
if
you
think
madame
request
unreasonable
i
really
do
see
myself
why
you
should
consent
i
am
simply
the
bearer
of
a
message
my
dear
young
lady
pray
sit
down
johnson
invited
pushing
a
wicker
chair
towards
her
please
assure
madame
i
fear
that
her
name
is
a
little
beyond
me
that
i
should
be
very
glad
indeed
for
smith
to
continue
to
render
her
the
services
which
he
has
hitherto
performed
as
to
remuneration
she
began
johnson
waved
his
hand
pray
settle
that
with
the
man
himself
he
begged
i
shall
allow
him
his
half
an
hour
off
each
day
he
has
an
under
gardener
and
can
spare
the
time
it
is
only
a
neighbourly
action
anything
madame
may
choose
to
give
him
is
no
concern
of
mine
you
are
very
kind
she
said
doubtfully
but
i
do
not
think
that
madame
will
care
to
accept
the
man
services
in
your
time
without
seeing
that
you
are
recompensed
make
your
own
arrangements
then
he
suggested
the
matter
is
scarcely
worth
serious
discussion
the
young
woman
rose
you
are
very
kind
she
repeated
you
must
excuse
my
having
come
to
see
you
in
this
informal
fashion
it
was
madame
desire
and
i
have
to
obey
orders
i
will
excuse
it
my
dear
young
lady
he
declared
on
one
condition
condition
that
you
sit
down
and
talk
to
me
for
a
minute
or
two
why
should
i
do
that
she
asked
with
a
querulous
uplifting
of
the
eyebrows
which
he
had
already
noticed
were
very
fine
and
silky
because
we
are
neighbours
he
replied
because
i
have
just
returned
to
this
country
after
many
years
spent
abroad
and
i
am
at
times
lonely
because
i
am
quite
sure
that
madame
can
spare
you
for
half
an
hour
and
because
here
is
a
great
idea
if
i
let
you
have
my
gardener
for
half
an
hour
why
should
madame
as
you
call
her
let
me
have
her
companion
for
the
same
length
of
time
she
looked
at
him
with
mild
curiosity
her
was
so
marked
as
to
indicate
indifference
is
it
my
fancy
she
asked
or
are
you
rather
a
strange
person
i
like
to
talk
he
confided
all
my
life
i
have
had
to
live
amongst
silent
people
that
is
finished
agreeable
society
is
one
of
the
things
to
which
i
have
looked
forward
upon
my
return
to
england
then
why
on
earth
did
you
come
to
market
ballaston
she
demanded
with
unexpected
vehemence
you
wo
find
any
society
here
why
did
you
come
why
did
you
choose
this
place
she
had
without
warning
adopted
an
almost
inquisitive
tone
but
his
eyes
met
hers
steadily
he
seemed
to
be
trying
to
divine
her
sudden
access
of
interest
i
came
he
explained
because
i
like
a
large
house
and
gardens
when
i
can
afford
them
and
this
place
is
very
cheap
i
had
to
settle
down
somewhere
and
this
neighbourhood
is
as
good
as
any
other
as
to
the
people
well
if
there
is
no
one
here
who
wants
to
be
friendly
i
must
make
the
best
of
it
i
have
been
abroad
for
a
great
many
years
but
i
have
a
few
friends
left
who
will
find
me
out
in
time
the
little
spark
of
interest
seemed
to
have
entirely
died
out
of
her
manner
i
see
she
murmured
the
house
certainly
is
a
pleasant
one
we
scarcely
expected
though
to
see
it
let
so
soon
why
not
people
have
ideas
you
know
the
story
of
the
last
tenant
here
i
heard
it
after
i
had
taken
the
house
he
confided
she
pointed
to
the
library
window
on
the
ground
floor
he
was
shot
one
night
in
the
study
there
she
told
him
terrible
and
what
seems
more
terrible
still
i
understand
that
the
murderer
was
never
caught
surely
some
one
must
have
been
suspected
the
girl
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
had
accepted
one
of
her
cigarettes
and
was
smoking
lazily
and
with
a
certain
measure
of
content
i
think
she
said
that
every
one
in
the
village
has
been
suspected
including
wilkinson
the
clergyman
myself
every
one
up
at
the
hall
and
all
the
servants
the
hard
thing
however
has
always
been
to
discover
any
possible
motive
nothing
was
taken
from
the
room
then
i
suppose
he
enquired
nothing
that
could
be
traced
nothing
apparently
of
any
value
endacott
had
been
occupied
in
the
translation
of
some
wonderful
chinese
manuscripts
at
the
time
the
affair
happened
the
box
containing
them
was
upset
and
the
manuscripts
were
all
over
the
place
but
no
one
could
tell
if
any
were
missing
or
if
they
were
of
any
real
value
even
his
niece
miss
endacott
who
ought
to
have
known
had
nothing
whatever
to
say
what
sort
of
a
man
was
this
predecessor
of
mine
he
asked
he
had
been
a
great
scholar
in
his
day
she
answered
a
little
doubtfully
but
really
i
only
saw
him
once
or
twice
some
of
the
papers
called
him
the
greatest
living
authority
on
chinese
art
and
antiquities
he
had
spent
nearly
all
his
life
out
there
of
cheerful
disposition
not
very
he
was
exceedingly
reserved
and
seemed
all
the
time
engrossed
in
his
work
he
chose
this
part
of
the
world
i
think
to
be
near
madame
but
considering
that
they
were
brother
and
sister
he
saw
very
little
of
her
and
the
young
lady
his
niece
she
was
very
attractive
i
suppose
you
might
say
beautiful
was
the
somewhat
cold
reply
she
left
soon
after
the
inquest
and
returned
yet
she
is
coming
to
stay
with
madame
i
believe
very
shortly
a
most
mysterious
affair
johnson
reflected
yet
i
dare
say
if
one
knew
where
to
start
the
solution
would
be
very
simple
now
supposing
miss
besant
any
one
were
to
offer
you
the
thing
you
most
desired
in
life
to
discover
who
fired
that
shot
where
should
you
start
your
investigations
she
turned
her
head
and
looked
at
him
the
sleepy
droop
of
her
eyelids
had
for
a
moment
gone
and
he
saw
that
her
eyes
themselves
were
beautiful
i
have
not
the
faintest
idea
she
assured
him
nature
never
meant
me
for
a
detective
i
have
too
little
imagination
there
was
a
brief
silence
the
young
lady
began
to
make
preparations
for
departure
tell
me
her
companion
ventured
now
that
i
am
settling
down
here
i
should
like
to
be
neighbourly
it
is
of
course
impossible
for
madame
to
come
and
see
me
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
call
upon
her
in
a
general
way
she
replied
after
a
moment
hesitation
i
should
have
told
you
at
once
that
it
was
altogether
impossible
madame
detests
visitors
the
outer
gate
is
generally
kept
locked
as
a
hint
but
curiously
enough
she
has
shown
the
utmost
interest
in
your
coming
she
will
bombard
me
with
questions
when
i
return
unless
what
i
say
satisfies
her
it
is
very
possible
that
she
may
consent
to
receive
your
visit
although
she
added
you
wo
get
much
amusement
out
of
it
in
any
case
he
said
i
hope
before
long
that
madame
may
require
some
other
trifling
service
and
that
you
will
again
be
her
ambassadress
she
left
him
vouchsafing
only
the
most
casual
of
farewells
and
passing
round
the
corner
of
the
house
without
a
backward
glance
johnson
watched
her
every
step
an
ordinary
young
woman
without
a
doubt
wearing
ordinary
clothes
saying
ordinary
things
and
with
an
unusual
gift
for
concealment
yet
there
was
something
in
her
very
reticence
which
had
its
allurement
johnson
who
was
not
a
profound
psychologist
although
he
had
always
understood
the
men
with
whom
he
had
had
to
deal
had
a
flash
of
inspiration
she
was
ordinary
just
as
she
was
reticent
because
she
was
by
temperament
or
circumstance
intensely
he
came
to
the
conclusion
as
he
returned
to
his
unaccustomed
pursuit
and
fluffed
mashie
shot
after
mashie
shot
that
there
existed
a
miss
besant
at
present
entirely
unrevealed
at
precisely
three
that
afternoon
there
occurred
what
was
looked
upon
almost
as
a
pageant
in
the
village
with
great
ceremony
the
very
fine
gates
leading
to
the
hall
were
thrown
open
by
the
lodge
keeper
and
in
the
small
brougham
which
only
left
the
ballaston
stables
three
or
four
times
a
year
drawn
by
a
couple
of
dark
bay
horses
whose
sides
shone
like
satin
and
whose
harness
glittered
from
every
point
of
view
in
iridescent
splendour
henry
ballaston
on
behalf
of
the
family
came
to
call
upon
the
newcomer
at
the
great
house
from
the
lodge
gates
onward
the
progress
of
the
seldom
seen
lesser
autocrat
of
the
village
and
neighbourhood
was
something
like
a
royal
procession
the
tradesmen
hastened
to
their
shop
windows
to
perform
their
salutes
the
roadmender
stood
looking
downward
as
one
receiving
a
blessing
the
solitary
occupant
of
the
brougham
sat
with
expressionless
face
his
hand
raised
all
the
time
to
his
hat
it
was
impressive
and
distinctly
a
survival
arrived
at
the
somewhat
gates
of
solid
oak
which
formed
the
entrance
to
the
great
house
the
footman
sprang
to
the
ground
and
drew
from
its
resting
place
amongst
the
ivy
the
knob
of
the
bell
the
gates
were
thrown
open
morton
received
the
visitor
at
the
front
door
and
escorted
him
to
where
his
master
lay
stretched
in
a
basket
chair
under
a
cedar
tree
at
the
farthest
corner
of
the
lawn
henry
ballaston
sir
he
announced
peter
johnson
stumbled
to
his
feet
and
henry
ballaston
removed
his
hat
in
courtly
and
formal
salute
he
was
strangely
dressed
for
the
country
in
a
black
cut
away
coat
and
grey
checked
trousers
the
shape
of
his
collar
belonged
to
a
past
generation
he
wore
a
black
satin
tie
folded
over
and
secured
by
a
pearl
pin
a
bowler
hat
carried
now
in
his
hand
and
grey
suède
gloves
you
are
i
presume
he
said
withdrawing
the
glove
from
his
right
hand
before
extending
it
our
new
neighbour
johnson
i
have
called
on
behalf
of
my
brother
and
myself
for
the
purpose
of
welcoming
you
to
this
neighbourhood
johnson
took
the
outstretched
hand
and
released
it
almost
at
once
here
was
a
man
he
decided
after
his
own
heart
a
man
difficult
to
read
of
immense
reticences
it
is
very
kind
of
you
to
come
he
said
i
am
sure
i
scarcely
expected
it
i
have
been
given
to
understand
that
neither
you
nor
your
brother
pay
many
visits
i
am
afraid
henry
ballaston
assented
accepting
the
chair
which
morton
had
brought
out
that
we
are
both
a
little
neglectful
of
our
duties
in
that
respect
you
are
so
near
a
neighbour
however
that
i
permitted
myself
the
pleasure
of
devoting
a
spare
to
making
your
acquaintance
very
kind
of
you
i
am
sure
johnson
repeated
fine
old
property
yours
ballaston
hall
has
many
points
of
interest
the
other
admitted
i
trust
that
we
may
soon
have
the
pleasure
of
seeing
you
there
my
brother
he
added
with
a
little
sigh
finds
many
calls
upon
his
time
he
is
chairman
of
the
quarter
sessions
lord
lieutenant
of
the
county
and
he
takes
some
interest
in
the
political
activities
of
our
member
he
is
furthermore
master
of
the
hounds
here
as
i
dare
say
you
know
he
desired
me
to
say
however
that
he
should
look
forward
to
the
pleasure
of
making
your
you
yourself
are
agreeably
housed
here
i
like
the
place
its
tenant
admitted
in
many
respects
it
suits
me
admirably
i
find
it
interesting
and
also
laudable
henry
ballaston
observed
as
no
doubt
do
many
other
of
your
neighbours
that
you
were
not
deterred
from
taking
up
your
residence
here
on
account
of
the
tragedy
the
unfortunate
accident
which
befell
the
late
owner
of
the
house
johnson
looked
for
a
moment
steadily
across
the
iron
fence
close
to
which
they
were
seated
it
was
a
typically
restful
summer
afternoon
from
the
distance
came
the
soothing
sound
of
a
machine
there
was
a
murmur
of
bees
amongst
the
roses
the
faintest
rustle
of
west
wind
amongst
the
shrubs
all
the
time
those
cold
blue
eyes
watched
him
there
was
no
sign
of
anxiety
or
even
of
interest
in
henry
ballaston
expressionless
face
his
attitude
remained
stiff
and
formal
his
eyes
never
wavered
in
their
steadfast
gaze
i
was
not
told
of
the
incident
to
which
you
refer
johnson
confided
until
after
i
had
signed
the
contract
but
in
any
case
i
do
know
that
it
would
have
made
any
difference
the
quiet
of
this
place
soothes
me
to
one
who
has
lived
a
busy
life
in
foreign
cities
there
is
a
great
attraction
in
the
peaceful
outlook
of
a
village
like
this
that
is
easily
comprehensible
henry
ballaston
admitted
judicially
still
there
are
many
country
places
with
attractions
more
obvious
than
market
ballaston
can
offer
golf
links
in
the
immediate
vicinity
for
instance
shooting
or
hunting
that
may
be
so
the
other
agreed
my
life
however
has
been
too
busy
a
one
to
cultivate
any
taste
for
such
things
i
understand
there
are
excellent
golf
links
in
the
neighbourhood
if
later
on
i
find
it
necessary
to
seek
amusement
outside
my
gardens
shooting
after
a
fashion
i
have
at
times
indulged
in
i
gather
however
that
there
is
none
to
let
within
reasonable
distance
no
ballaston
shooting
has
been
let
for
many
years
was
the
somewhat
stiff
reply
from
what
part
of
the
world
might
i
ask
johnson
do
you
come
from
all
quarters
of
it
i
am
by
birth
an
american
but
i
have
travelled
a
great
deal
of
recent
years
the
english
life
is
almost
unknown
to
me
it
is
perhaps
for
that
reason
that
i
appreciate
these
surroundings
henry
ballaston
nodded
gravely
i
trust
he
said
that
you
will
find
all
your
expectations
realised
it
is
a
surprise
to
me
he
added
to
learn
that
you
are
of
american
birth
your
accent
would
not
betray
the
fact
i
left
america
johnson
explained
when
i
was
nineteen
years
old
and
i
have
only
once
returned
to
new
york
since
then
i
have
learned
to
speak
many
languages
my
business
has
required
it
as
regards
the
tragedy
to
which
you
have
alluded
he
went
on
after
a
momentary
pause
although
having
settled
here
i
shall
not
allow
myself
to
be
disturbed
by
it
i
will
confess
that
the
story
i
was
told
last
evening
of
the
murder
in
my
library
was
rather
a
shock
abroad
we
have
always
had
a
very
high
opinion
of
the
british
detective
service
it
seems
incredible
that
in
a
small
place
like
this
such
a
crime
should
remain
undetected
it
is
i
believe
was
the
cold
admission
a
circumstance
without
precedent
i
gather
that
no
clue
or
motive
of
any
sort
has
been
discovered
johnson
persisted
from
all
that
one
can
hear
the
murdered
man
appears
to
have
been
an
entirely
harmless
individual
and
his
belongings
not
in
the
least
likely
to
attract
the
ordinary
type
of
criminal
there
are
other
of
your
neighbours
henry
ballaston
surmised
with
marked
aloofness
who
can
tell
you
much
more
of
the
affair
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
it
remains
only
an
unpleasant
we
hope
very
much
my
brother
and
i
johnson
that
you
will
give
us
the
pleasure
of
your
company
at
luncheon
at
the
hall
you
are
very
kind
i
am
sure
if
agreeable
to
you
and
if
you
will
pardon
the
short
notice
we
will
say
at
one
the
visitor
suggested
rising
my
nephew
is
at
home
for
a
short
time
before
proceeding
abroad
otherwise
we
shall
be
once
more
johnson
i
bid
you
welcome
and
trust
that
you
will
derive
all
the
pleasure
you
anticipate
from
your
residence
here
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
a
little
speechless
escorted
his
visitor
to
the
front
entrance
before
which
the
carriage
was
waiting
at
their
approach
a
footman
threw
open
the
door
of
the
brougham
the
coachman
sat
up
in
his
seat
the
horses
fretted
from
the
flies
pawed
the
gravel
henry
ballaston
with
a
formal
bow
of
farewell
took
his
seat
and
with
the
sun
glittering
upon
the
silver
of
the
harness
and
the
brightly
polished
shiny
top
of
the
brougham
this
visit
of
ceremony
was
brought
to
an
end
back
through
the
village
street
with
eyes
looking
this
time
neither
to
the
right
nor
to
the
left
through
the
lodge
gates
where
his
hand
sought
the
brim
of
his
hat
in
mechanical
salute
to
the
curtseying
doorkeeper
along
the
winding
avenue
and
through
the
iron
gates
up
to
the
great
front
of
the
hall
henry
ballaston
passed
on
his
return
journey
and
finally
reached
his
destination
he
entered
the
cool
lofty
hall
handed
his
hat
and
gloves
to
the
footman
who
was
waiting
and
hesitated
for
a
moment
the
door
of
the
library
was
unexpectedly
opened
sir
bertram
strolled
out
as
though
by
accident
well
my
dutiful
brother
he
asked
his
tone
though
apparently
careless
betraying
an
underlying
anxiety
henry
waited
until
he
had
reached
his
brother
side
the
man
appears
to
be
perfectly
harmless
he
confided
he
will
take
lunch
with
us
good
sir
bertram
approved
i
shall
go
and
change
now
i
am
going
to
have
a
few
sets
of
tennis
with
gregory
henry
ballaston
crossed
the
hall
and
passing
through
the
library
entered
the
smaller
room
which
had
been
devoted
to
his
use
gregory
in
flannels
and
with
a
tennis
racket
under
his
arm
was
apparently
engaged
in
examining
one
of
the
catalogues
he
turned
around
as
his
uncle
entered
hullo
he
exclaimed
you
back
already
my
call
i
thought
was
of
suitable
length
was
the
measured
rejoinder
what
sort
of
a
fellow
is
this
new
tenant
of
ours
gregory
demanded
his
uncle
paused
for
a
moment
gregory
fingers
were
nervously
tapping
the
manuscript
which
he
held
a
very
ordinary
sort
of
person
he
pronounced
who
appears
to
have
found
his
way
here
entirely
by
accident
gregory
replaced
on
the
shelf
the
catalogue
which
he
had
been
studying
he
failed
to
notice
that
he
had
been
holding
the
volume
upside
down
good
of
you
to
do
the
duty
stunt
uncle
henry
he
observed
it
has
always
been
one
of
my
few
obligations
was
the
quiet
reply
johnson
is
lunching
with
us
i
go
over
to
cromer
until
the
afternoon
then
gregory
announced
one
may
as
well
be
civil
and
i
have
rather
a
fancy
to
see
what
the
fellow
is
like
chapter
iv
at
twelve
on
the
following
morning
peter
johnson
dressed
in
a
blue
serge
suit
and
patent
shoes
a
costume
which
after
much
deliberation
he
deemed
suitable
for
the
enterprise
on
which
he
was
bent
mounted
his
car
drove
through
the
village
exchanging
polite
greetings
with
one
or
two
of
his
recent
acquaintances
and
after
a
moment
wait
at
the
lodge
gates
proceeded
at
a
subdued
pace
along
the
winding
road
which
crossed
the
park
and
up
through
the
great
avenue
to
the
front
entrance
of
the
hall
he
left
his
automobile
in
a
secluded
place
and
found
the
door
open
as
he
mounted
the
steps
rawson
unrecognising
stony
of
face
and
feature
took
his
name
a
footman
relieved
him
of
his
hat
and
gloves
another
subordinate
lurking
in
the
background
threw
open
the
door
of
the
library
into
which
the
visitor
was
ushered
johnson
the
man
announced
henry
ballaston
came
forward
and
greeted
his
guest
with
punctilious
cordiality
then
he
turned
to
his
brother
who
had
been
lounging
on
the
reading
a
newspaper
but
who
now
came
forward
with
outstretched
hand
this
is
my
brother
sir
bertram
ballaston
johnson
our
new
tenant
at
the
great
house
the
two
men
shook
hands
johnson
a
little
formally
his
host
with
an
indifferent
but
pleasant
courtesy
sir
bertram
had
grown
somewhat
thinner
perhaps
during
the
last
twelve
months
of
ever
increasing
financial
anxiety
his
eyes
seemed
a
trifle
sunken
and
the
weariness
of
his
mouth
was
a
little
more
pronounced
his
smile
however
as
he
unbent
was
as
ingratiating
as
ever
and
his
voice
as
insinuating
i
am
very
glad
to
have
this
opportunity
of
meeting
you
johnson
he
said
you
will
excuse
my
having
commissioned
my
brother
to
represent
the
family
i
happened
to
be
engaged
for
some
days
and
we
were
anxious
not
to
delay
making
your
acquaintance
your
brother
was
very
welcome
was
the
prompt
assurance
very
kind
and
neighbourly
of
you
to
look
me
up
at
all
i
am
a
complete
stranger
here
and
i
may
add
to
england
indeed
sir
bertram
murmured
civilly
might
one
enquire
then
whilst
congratulating
ourselves
upon
your
choice
what
made
you
select
this
particular
part
of
the
world
for
your
abode
every
one
seems
to
ask
me
that
question
johnson
observed
i
imagine
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
chance
about
it
i
wished
to
settle
down
in
england
for
a
time
and
from
all
i
had
heard
i
thought
norfolk
the
most
suitable
locality
i
went
to
an
agent
in
norwich
found
this
house
at
what
i
considered
a
very
low
rental
and
established
myself
and
why
not
indeed
sir
bertram
demanded
approvingly
for
any
one
who
wishes
to
live
a
really
retired
life
amongst
rural
surroundings
a
better
choice
could
scarcely
be
i
am
afraid
johnson
that
we
can
not
offer
you
anything
in
the
way
of
a
modern
apéritif
if
a
glass
of
amontillado
sherry
pleases
you
i
think
that
you
will
find
this
drinkable
my
father
was
reputed
to
be
a
judge
rawson
who
had
entered
with
a
tray
poured
out
three
glasses
from
a
bottle
reclining
in
a
cradle
with
something
approaching
reverence
in
his
manner
johnson
accepted
the
sherry
and
drank
wine
such
as
he
had
never
tasted
before
just
as
he
was
setting
the
glass
down
the
door
opened
and
gregory
entered
he
came
forward
with
all
his
father
grace
but
a
little
more
impetuously
this
is
my
son
gregory
sir
bertram
announced
johnson
gregory
our
new
tenant
gregory
expression
as
he
had
advanced
to
meet
his
father
guest
had
been
one
of
polite
but
somewhat
indifferent
curiosity
he
suddenly
stopped
short
however
the
light
of
amazed
recognition
flashed
in
his
eyes
for
a
brief
period
of
time
he
was
absolutely
speechless
i
am
happy
to
meet
you
johnson
said
gregory
hand
for
a
moment
sought
his
throat
the
blank
look
of
in
the
face
of
this
suave
man
was
arresting
yet
such
a
likeness
could
scarcely
be
possible
his
brain
was
still
confused
afire
with
a
surge
of
memories
of
that
still
oily
river
the
merciless
sun
his
bonds
afterwards
the
quiet
cool
warehouse
with
its
pungent
odours
its
jumble
of
merchandise
its
sombre
silences
he
became
suddenly
conscious
of
his
father
surprise
of
henry
questioning
frown
surely
he
ventured
at
last
we
have
met
before
johnson
shook
his
head
slowly
not
within
my
recollection
he
acknowledged
there
was
another
although
a
briefer
silence
a
matter
now
only
of
seconds
but
intense
whilst
it
lasted
gregory
looking
a
trifle
dazed
held
out
his
hand
his
eyes
however
remained
fixed
upon
the
face
and
the
wonder
had
never
left
them
so
sorry
to
seem
such
an
idiot
he
murmured
politely
but
even
now
i
am
a
little
bewildered
we
did
meet
fifteen
months
ago
in
china
wu
ling
the
firm
of
johnson
and
company
the
visitor
shook
his
head
his
smile
was
but
to
a
keen
observer
a
little
sphinxlike
his
eyes
never
wavered
you
are
mistaking
me
for
some
one
else
he
said
my
name
is
certainly
johnson
but
it
is
not
an
uncommon
one
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
this
is
our
first
meeting
it
is
my
memory
which
is
at
fault
then
gregory
observed
relapsing
with
an
effort
into
his
usual
self
glad
to
welcome
you
here
johnson
rawson
am
i
to
be
allowed
a
glass
of
the
sherry
good
i
need
it
luncheon
was
served
with
a
certain
measured
but
not
ungraceful
ceremony
the
food
was
excellent
and
although
the
fact
was
not
alluded
to
the
guest
of
the
meal
who
possessed
an
instinctive
appreciation
of
such
things
realised
that
he
was
drinking
cabinet
hock
of
an
almost
extinct
vintage
conversation
never
flagged
but
it
was
conducted
upon
a
level
and
in
a
spirit
which
were
a
little
difficult
to
the
visitor
there
was
no
attempt
at
humour
or
story
telling
even
personal
reminiscences
and
questionings
of
all
sorts
were
eschewed
there
were
grave
remarks
about
politics
county
affairs
the
prospects
of
the
forthcoming
shooting
season
johnson
ventured
to
express
once
more
his
hope
of
renting
a
little
shooting
himself
i
am
afraid
his
host
regretted
that
such
a
thing
is
out
of
the
question
for
the
moment
the
ballaston
shooting
extends
for
some
distance
in
every
direction
and
i
do
not
allow
my
tenant
farmers
to
concede
their
sporting
rights
we
shall
of
course
be
happy
for
you
to
shoot
with
us
whenever
you
feel
inclined
but
from
the
point
of
view
of
sport
i
fear
that
you
have
chosen
a
somewhat
unfavourable
neighbourhood
i
speak
of
the
immediate
present
in
the
near
future
there
may
be
changes
the
matter
does
not
greatly
concern
me
was
the
equable
reply
i
have
shot
birds
and
beasts
in
different
places
but
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
a
sportsman
i
shall
find
a
great
deal
of
occupation
in
my
garden
in
country
walks
and
motoring
i
was
telling
my
son
this
morning
sir
bertram
observed
that
i
consider
our
agent
borroughes
was
very
much
to
blame
for
not
having
told
you
the
inner
history
of
the
great
house
before
you
took
it
it
would
perhaps
have
been
better
johnson
admitted
at
the
same
time
it
would
have
made
no
difference
to
my
plans
were
you
personally
acquainted
with
my
unfortunate
predecessor
we
had
exchanged
some
few
civilities
sir
bertram
replied
our
acquaintance
however
was
nothing
but
that
slight
affair
which
exists
between
neighbours
but
for
the
unfortunate
tragedy
which
occurred
we
should
probably
have
become
more
intimate
endacott
happened
to
be
a
brother
of
an
old
friend
of
mine
the
comtesse
de
fourgenet
who
resides
at
the
little
house
it
was
for
that
reason
i
imagine
that
he
elected
to
settle
down
in
this
neighbourhood
there
was
a
niece
johnson
ventured
a
very
charming
young
person
sir
bertram
conceded
she
naturally
enough
left
the
neighbourhood
very
soon
afterwards
i
understand
however
that
she
is
expected
shortly
on
a
visit
to
the
little
house
luncheon
drew
towards
its
close
a
very
wonderful
port
was
served
and
drunk
after
preliminary
encomiums
in
respectful
silence
sir
bertram
rose
to
his
feet
we
shall
find
cigars
and
coffee
in
the
library
johnson
he
said
if
i
can
not
persuade
you
to
drink
another
glass
of
wine
we
might
perhaps
rise
the
four
men
left
the
room
together
the
guest
of
the
morning
on
his
way
across
the
hall
looked
about
him
with
an
interest
which
was
entirely
genuine
for
in
his
way
he
was
a
lover
of
beautiful
things
gregory
drew
his
attention
to
a
famous
picture
opposite
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
detained
him
until
they
became
temporarily
detached
from
the
others
after
a
casual
reference
indifferently
voiced
to
a
old
master
his
tone
suddenly
changed
it
was
intense
curiously
vibrant
i
must
ask
you
once
more
he
said
quietly
i
must
ask
you
this
johnson
do
you
remember
a
man
a
brave
fellow
he
was
who
used
to
trade
up
the
river
amongst
the
villages
wu
ling
they
called
him
wu
ling
johnson
repeated
a
chinaman
he
passed
as
such
gregory
admitted
he
might
have
been
anything
his
name
even
might
have
been
johnson
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
smiled
tolerantly
wu
ling
he
commented
is
a
very
nice
name
on
the
whole
i
prefer
it
to
my
own
mine
is
and
always
has
been
johnson
peter
johnson
peter
johnson
of
new
york
gregory
led
the
way
towards
the
library
it
seemed
to
him
that
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
sorry
he
apologised
i
am
pretty
good
at
faces
as
a
rule
and
i
never
thought
i
could
make
a
mistake
about
this
one
glad
to
hear
you
are
a
neighbour
johnson
we
shall
find
the
others
in
here
he
threw
open
the
door
of
the
library
and
ushered
in
his
companion
his
father
and
uncle
were
talking
together
with
their
coffee
cups
in
their
hands
they
abandoned
their
conversation
precipitately
as
the
door
opened
i
was
afraid
sir
bertram
said
that
gregory
was
commencing
to
show
you
the
pictures
you
would
find
that
rather
a
lengthy
undertaking
an
undertaking
which
would
interest
me
very
much
johnson
declared
i
understand
that
one
day
a
week
visitors
are
permitted
to
see
over
the
hall
i
shall
venture
to
present
myself
with
the
crowd
there
is
no
necessity
for
you
to
do
anything
of
the
sort
sir
bertram
assured
him
my
housekeeper
will
be
glad
to
show
you
over
at
any
time
some
of
the
paintings
in
the
gallery
are
generally
considered
to
be
quite
worth
inspection
and
our
tapestries
are
famous
the
chapel
has
a
screen
which
personally
i
think
the
most
beautiful
in
norfolk
perhaps
you
would
care
to
see
it
after
you
have
drunk
your
coffee
i
should
like
to
very
much
johnson
confessed
sir
bertram
remained
a
courteous
but
reserved
host
henry
with
strenuous
effort
imparting
now
and
then
a
note
of
greater
intimacy
to
the
conversation
gregory
remained
silent
though
restless
after
they
had
finished
their
coffee
they
glanced
at
some
of
the
tapestries
and
sir
bertram
led
the
way
towards
the
chapel
they
passed
through
the
smaller
library
which
henry
claimed
as
his
own
this
is
my
little
sanctum
he
announced
my
brother
leaves
most
matters
connected
with
the
estate
in
my
charge
and
this
is
where
i
deal
with
them
before
they
pass
on
to
mr
borroughes
the
visitor
looked
curiously
around
the
lofty
but
somewhat
severe
apartment
with
its
neatly
arranged
shelves
of
catalogues
its
piles
of
volumes
of
reference
its
letter
cases
and
many
evidences
of
business
detail
an
exceptionally
large
writing
table
filled
the
window
recess
on
which
stood
a
single
bronze
statue
several
curios
a
blotter
and
a
massive
stationery
rack
on
the
side
the
window
panelling
took
a
wide
inward
sweep
leaving
a
space
half
platform
half
pedestal
in
the
centre
stood
a
fine
china
bowl
filled
with
deep
red
roses
on
either
side
the
body
and
the
soul
johnson
gazed
first
at
one
of
the
images
then
at
the
other
speechless
expressionless
but
absorbed
all
the
cynical
vice
and
grotesque
wickedness
of
the
one
leered
at
him
from
the
side
of
those
drooping
roses
from
the
right
the
kindly
benevolent
face
of
a
saint
seemed
to
breathe
out
a
strange
atmosphere
of
peace
and
sanctity
johnson
made
no
comment
attempted
no
criticism
yet
his
very
silence
was
in
its
way
suggestive
gregory
watched
him
with
eager
interest
conscious
of
a
surging
resurrection
of
certain
vague
suspicions
in
the
background
henry
ballaston
though
his
face
showed
no
sign
of
emotion
also
watched
it
was
his
movement
which
dispelled
those
few
seconds
of
paralysed
silence
his
voice
always
a
pleasant
one
notwithstanding
its
formal
note
was
softer
and
lower
even
than
usual
but
there
was
a
curious
glint
in
his
cold
blue
eyes
you
find
our
miniature
buddhas
interesting
mr
johnson
he
asked
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
did
not
at
first
appear
to
hear
him
his
eyes
were
fixed
almost
to
rigidity
both
here
he
muttered
both
the
effect
of
his
exclamation
was
disconcerting
his
three
companions
closed
in
a
little
upon
him
there
was
something
menacing
about
their
silence
both
sir
bertram
repeated
at
last
with
the
air
of
a
puzzled
man
johnson
appeared
to
awake
from
his
lethargy
say
it
seems
to
me
he
remarked
lapsing
into
his
first
americanism
that
those
two
ought
to
be
worth
a
great
sum
of
money
i
seen
photographs
of
them
when
i
was
travelling
in
the
east
they
were
stolen
from
a
temple
somewhere
in
china
i
think
it
was
miniature
buddhas
are
they
stolen
sir
bertram
murmured
stolen
gregory
echoed
this
is
very
interesting
henry
declared
they
came
into
our
possession
in
a
somewhat
unusual
fashion
you
think
that
in
the
first
instance
they
were
probably
stolen
johnson
withdrew
his
eyes
from
them
at
last
i
should
say
they
surely
were
he
agreed
i
saw
a
photograph
of
them
in
an
american
magazine
about
twelve
months
ago
with
a
gigantic
buddha
between
them
they
were
quoted
as
having
been
stolen
and
being
for
some
reason
or
other
which
i
have
forgotten
immensely
valuable
columns
of
it
there
were
i
remember
the
young
american
who
started
out
to
get
them
was
discovered
with
his
throat
cut
in
the
train
from
pekin
southwards
nobody
seemed
to
know
what
had
become
of
the
images
there
was
a
brief
silence
a
sudden
almost
unaccountable
lessening
of
the
tension
of
the
last
few
minutes
johnson
loomed
no
longer
as
a
sinister
figure
of
fate
the
circumstances
under
which
we
came
into
possession
of
these
images
henry
intervened
would
seem
to
preclude
the
idea
of
their
being
the
ones
referred
to
in
your
magazine
article
still
the
story
is
interesting
johnson
turned
away
without
further
comment
the
subject
of
the
images
was
exhausted
the
screen
in
the
chapel
beyond
was
inspected
presently
he
took
a
formal
leave
of
his
hosts
we
shall
hope
to
see
more
of
you
johnson
sir
bertram
said
as
he
accompanied
him
on
to
the
terrace
we
do
not
entertain
much
at
present
but
my
son
will
be
giving
some
farewell
shooting
parties
before
his
departure
abroad
we
shall
hope
to
number
you
amongst
our
guests
very
kind
of
you
i
am
sure
johnson
replied
climbing
into
his
car
and
thrusting
in
his
clutch
my
visit
and
brief
glimpse
of
your
treasures
has
been
most
enjoyable
good
day
sir
bertram
good
day
gentlemen
he
drove
off
they
stood
watching
him
pass
through
the
iron
gates
into
the
park
sir
bertram
waved
his
hand
but
neither
of
the
other
two
indulged
in
any
farewell
salute
an
ordinary
sort
of
fellow
but
harmless
i
believe
sir
bertram
pronounced
there
were
moments
when
i
thought
otherwise
but
on
the
whole
i
am
inclined
to
agree
with
you
henry
conceded
after
a
reflection
gregory
thoughts
were
too
confused
for
speech
he
watched
the
car
until
it
became
a
speck
in
the
distance
then
he
turned
away
and
followed
the
others
into
the
house
chapter
v
the
afternoon
was
still
young
when
johnson
passed
through
the
park
gates
of
ballaston
hall
and
drove
slowly
down
the
village
street
on
his
way
back
to
the
great
house
he
studied
the
which
marked
the
road
to
norwich
and
hesitated
at
that
moment
a
young
woman
stepped
out
of
the
grocer
shop
and
recognising
him
nodded
in
spiritless
fashion
johnson
fancied
that
he
caught
an
almost
wistful
expression
as
she
glanced
critically
at
his
car
he
drew
up
by
the
side
of
the
cobbled
pavement
good
afternoon
miss
besant
he
said
good
afternoon
she
rejoined
looking
up
as
though
surprised
i
thought
of
motoring
in
to
norwich
he
confided
i
wonder
whether
you
would
care
to
come
it
will
take
three
quarters
of
an
hour
to
an
hour
and
i
need
not
stay
there
for
many
minutes
it
sounds
delightful
she
admitted
but
i
am
afraid
that
it
is
quite
impossible
madame
is
very
restless
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
she
would
not
allow
it
you
might
ask
her
he
suggested
she
hesitated
i
might
she
agreed
doubtfully
but
i
am
afraid
it
would
be
scarcely
worth
while
asking
you
to
wait
nonsense
i
have
nothing
to
do
he
replied
cheerfully
jump
in
and
i
drive
you
to
the
gate
i
rather
you
waited
at
the
corner
she
begged
i
come
back
and
tell
you
anyway
johnson
obeyed
instructions
he
drew
up
at
the
point
where
a
curved
around
to
his
own
and
the
little
house
and
on
to
a
chain
of
rather
remote
villages
descended
and
glanced
into
his
petrol
tank
lit
a
cigarette
and
settled
down
to
wait
in
a
few
minutes
miss
besant
reappeared
he
was
conscious
of
a
measure
of
disappointment
which
rather
puzzled
him
when
he
saw
that
she
was
still
without
gloves
or
coat
nevertheless
there
was
a
slightly
eager
expression
in
her
face
madame
has
surprised
me
very
much
she
announced
as
she
paused
by
the
side
of
the
car
she
seems
willing
for
me
to
go
but
she
would
like
to
speak
to
you
first
delighted
johnson
replied
preparing
to
alight
i
proposed
myself
as
a
visitor
yesterday
as
you
may
remember
the
young
woman
nodded
for
some
reason
or
another
she
confided
madame
is
very
curious
about
you
directly
i
mentioned
your
name
and
said
that
you
were
outside
she
told
me
to
fetch
you
in
please
be
careful
what
you
say
to
her
she
is
very
peculiar
and
every
one
humours
her
whilst
you
are
talking
i
shall
get
my
coat
and
gloves
i
do
my
best
he
promised
her
as
he
held
open
the
gate
keep
me
too
long
i
can
foresee
that
conversation
with
madame
will
be
difficult
i
hope
she
knows
that
i
have
lived
abroad
for
a
long
time
and
am
unused
to
ladies
society
you
manage
all
right
she
assured
him
encouragingly
she
opened
the
front
door
and
led
him
across
the
low
almost
square
hall
to
the
ceiling
and
with
several
strange
and
to
johnson
taste
not
yet
educated
to
futurism
extremely
bizarre
pictures
upon
the
wall
then
she
opened
another
door
softly
and
beckoned
him
to
follow
her
this
is
johnson
who
has
come
to
live
at
the
great
house
madame
she
announced
she
left
him
then
and
johnson
crossed
the
room
towards
the
couch
his
curiosity
concerning
madame
rather
increased
as
he
bent
down
to
take
her
unexpectedly
beautiful
hand
she
was
lying
flat
on
her
back
in
a
sort
of
invalid
chair
which
was
drawn
up
as
usual
to
an
open
window
and
from
her
waist
downwards
she
was
covered
by
a
beautiful
chinese
wrap
of
light
texture
he
was
astonished
by
the
lack
of
wrinkles
in
her
face
the
clearness
of
its
complexion
the
absence
of
any
sign
of
illness
a
lace
scarf
around
her
neck
was
fastened
by
an
exquisite
pin
with
ancient
paste
gems
and
the
fingers
of
the
hand
which
still
remained
in
his
seemed
ablaze
with
jewels
all
of
them
with
settings
which
contained
however
some
really
fine
gems
so
you
are
my
new
neighbour
she
remarked
abruptly
her
voice
gave
johnson
further
cause
for
surprise
it
was
very
low
and
very
musical
but
it
possessed
other
qualities
which
he
found
it
difficult
to
define
i
have
come
to
live
at
the
great
house
for
a
time
he
replied
why
have
you
come
here
she
demanded
he
accepted
the
chair
to
which
she
had
pointed
imperiously
it
is
a
most
extraordinary
thing
he
said
but
every
person
i
have
met
since
i
came
here
has
asked
me
the
same
question
why
should
i
not
choose
to
come
and
live
a
quiet
life
in
market
ballaston
the
place
pleased
me
i
wished
to
live
in
the
country
in
norfolk
for
choice
the
house
and
the
surroundings
were
just
what
i
wanted
i
do
believe
a
word
you
saying
she
declared
shortly
johnson
himself
something
of
an
adept
in
the
art
of
guarded
conversation
was
taken
thoroughly
aback
for
a
moment
he
could
think
of
nothing
to
say
why
do
you
want
to
come
and
live
in
a
house
in
an
village
like
this
a
house
too
in
which
another
man
was
murdered
do
you
wish
me
to
believe
that
it
was
chance
or
perhaps
morbid
curiosity
or
had
you
another
reason
my
dear
madame
johnson
assured
her
as
to
morbid
curiosity
not
a
soul
even
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
till
after
i
had
paid
over
the
contract
deposit
and
secured
the
lease
of
the
house
never
mind
whether
they
mentioned
it
or
not
she
persisted
her
fine
eyes
challenging
his
do
you
mean
to
tell
me
that
you
did
know
about
it
johnson
thoroughly
on
his
guard
now
adopted
a
soothing
tone
how
could
i
he
expostulated
i
am
a
complete
stranger
to
this
neighbourhood
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
spent
most
of
my
life
abroad
the
man
who
was
murdered
she
continued
you
know
he
was
my
brother
had
also
lived
abroad
had
you
met
him
coincidences
are
scarcely
likely
to
multiply
themselves
he
remarked
drily
i
hail
from
new
york
and
your
brother
i
understand
had
spent
most
of
his
life
in
china
she
lay
quite
still
for
a
moment
her
hands
clasped
she
seemed
to
be
considering
there
is
an
idea
here
she
recommenced
abruptly
that
you
are
either
a
detective
or
that
you
have
come
here
determined
for
some
reason
of
your
own
to
solve
the
mystery
of
my
brother
murder
that
you
knew
all
about
it
before
you
came
that
you
took
the
house
on
purpose
what
about
that
her
eyes
seemed
to
be
trying
to
bore
their
way
through
to
the
back
of
his
head
johnson
remained
imperturbable
my
dear
lady
he
protested
i
can
assure
you
that
this
is
a
foolish
fancy
she
had
raised
herself
a
little
and
she
sank
back
now
amongst
the
cushions
the
hard
insistence
had
gone
from
her
eyes
but
she
was
still
uneasy
i
hope
she
said
that
you
are
speaking
the
truth
i
hope
you
are
endacott
he
reflected
was
as
you
have
just
reminded
me
your
brother
he
was
she
admitted
then
why
he
asked
do
you
feel
so
strongly
upon
the
matter
i
mean
supposing
i
were
a
detective
which
i
am
not
or
an
amateur
criminologist
or
anything
of
that
sort
bent
upon
discovering
the
secret
of
the
crime
at
the
great
house
surely
you
should
welcome
my
efforts
why
not
a
gleam
of
horror
lit
her
eyes
you
know
nothing
about
it
she
cried
it
is
not
a
matter
for
any
one
to
meddle
with
ralph
was
my
brother
it
is
true
but
he
is
dead
and
there
is
an
end
of
it
i
am
his
nearest
surviving
relative
it
is
for
me
to
say
it
is
for
no
one
else
if
any
one
dares
to
interfere
they
shall
suffer
once
more
she
sank
back
exhausted
amongst
her
pillows
johnson
bent
over
her
with
the
air
of
a
doctor
soothing
a
refractory
patient
my
dear
neighbour
he
begged
please
believe
that
i
am
here
for
no
evil
or
malicious
purpose
whatsoever
under
no
circumstances
should
i
ever
take
any
course
likely
to
bring
distress
upon
you
i
am
not
at
all
the
sort
of
person
you
think
i
am
i
trust
not
she
acknowledged
a
little
wearily
have
you
taken
a
fancy
to
my
companion
i
would
go
quite
so
far
as
that
he
answered
smiling
but
i
must
confess
that
i
find
her
a
very
pleasant
young
person
i
was
just
off
alone
to
norwich
and
i
thought
that
the
ride
there
might
amuse
her
very
well
madame
decided
you
can
take
her
come
in
and
see
me
again
some
time
come
as
often
as
you
like
i
am
not
altogether
satisfied
about
you
i
wish
i
were
the
door
was
quietly
opened
and
miss
besant
appeared
dressed
for
her
excursion
madame
waved
her
hand
in
a
little
gesture
of
dismissal
is
there
anything
i
can
do
for
you
before
i
go
the
young
woman
asked
nothing
was
the
curt
reply
it
will
take
you
i
suppose
an
hour
to
go
to
norwich
an
hour
to
frivol
there
and
an
hour
to
return
see
that
you
do
not
exceed
that
time
very
good
madame
and
mr
johnson
madame
he
answered
looking
back
from
the
door
come
and
see
me
about
the
same
time
unless
you
are
engaged
if
so
find
out
from
miss
besant
what
time
will
suit
me
that
is
all
good
afternoon
johnson
followed
his
companion
across
the
hall
and
out
into
the
street
he
was
feeling
a
little
dazed
madame
he
remarked
has
a
great
deal
of
character
and
also
vivacity
for
an
invalid
the
girl
remained
silent
she
climbed
into
the
car
with
a
little
murmur
of
pleasure
madame
she
declared
settling
herself
down
contentedly
is
very
much
stronger
than
she
used
to
be
i
should
be
in
the
least
surprised
if
she
recovered
altogether
and
then
she
wo
need
a
companion
any
longer
johnson
swung
round
the
corner
with
the
skill
of
a
practised
driver
in
that
case
he
observed
my
sympathies
are
divided
chapter
vi
johnson
found
plenty
of
time
during
the
journey
to
norwich
to
exchange
remarks
with
and
take
notice
of
his
companion
the
sulkiness
of
her
expression
lightened
considerably
with
the
pleasure
of
the
rapid
motion
the
sense
of
freedom
springing
from
this
unexpected
holiday
the
road
wound
its
way
between
hedges
from
which
the
late
honeysuckle
still
drooped
through
a
tract
of
pleasant
and
varied
country
corn
fields
where
harvesting
machines
with
their
musical
mechanism
were
at
work
rich
meadows
where
the
cows
stood
in
herbage
across
a
great
common
where
clumps
of
heather
and
gorse
stretched
away
to
the
borders
of
a
thick
encircling
wood
the
ballaston
pheasants
strutted
about
on
every
side
from
a
slight
rise
in
the
road
a
mile
or
so
beyond
the
village
they
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
back
of
the
hall
i
lunched
there
johnson
confided
the
girl
looked
at
him
curiously
who
was
there
she
enquired
only
sir
bertram
and
his
son
and
henry
ballaston
i
thought
it
was
rather
decent
of
them
to
ask
me
she
made
no
reply
do
you
know
them
he
asked
i
see
sir
bertram
often
she
replied
he
comes
down
to
the
little
house
two
or
three
times
a
week
when
he
is
here
and
mr
henry
henry
does
not
visit
madame
to
my
knowledge
do
you
know
sir
bertram
son
gregory
he
continued
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
her
eyes
were
quite
wide
open
now
and
he
was
once
more
astonished
to
find
how
beautiful
they
were
nevertheless
their
expression
at
that
moment
was
not
pleasing
she
seemed
surprised
at
his
question
if
such
a
thing
were
possible
a
little
frightened
i
know
him
of
course
she
replied
he
too
visits
madame
occasionally
i
am
interested
in
the
family
johnson
confessed
and
i
have
faith
in
your
instincts
what
do
you
think
of
gregory
ballaston
what
should
i
think
of
him
she
answered
indifferently
a
young
man
run
after
at
times
by
all
the
young
women
in
the
county
a
great
sportsman
a
great
traveller
and
i
suppose
a
great
libertine
how
on
earth
should
i
madame
companion
know
or
think
anything
about
him
one
forms
impressions
he
murmured
if
i
allowed
myself
to
form
any
she
rejoined
they
would
be
favourable
he
treats
me
always
just
a
little
more
politely
because
i
am
a
dependent
if
i
were
a
silly
girl
i
dare
say
i
should
be
like
the
rest
of
them
in
this
horrible
neighbourhood
why
do
you
call
it
that
he
protested
i
call
it
that
she
rejoined
because
i
detest
nearly
all
the
people
i
know
in
it
well
there
do
seem
to
be
many
he
remarked
even
if
you
include
me
i
certainly
do
not
include
you
she
assured
him
you
may
disappoint
me
like
the
others
but
at
the
present
moment
you
seem
to
me
a
very
simple
person
who
actually
takes
the
trouble
to
go
out
of
his
way
to
do
a
kindness
not
in
the
least
he
protested
you
not
suggesting
i
hope
that
there
is
any
kindness
in
driving
you
to
norwich
why
not
she
retorted
what
else
can
it
be
it
is
certainly
pleasanter
for
me
he
pointed
out
to
have
you
by
my
side
than
to
go
alone
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
why
she
demanded
i
am
not
i
am
not
agreeable
i
am
not
amusing
if
you
are
fond
of
gallivanting
well
i
am
sure
that
you
have
sense
enough
to
know
that
it
does
appeal
to
me
how
can
i
possibly
therefore
be
of
any
interest
to
you
he
smiled
you
all
there
with
the
words
he
acknowledged
i
rather
depend
upon
feelings
i
only
know
that
i
feel
it
pleasanter
to
have
you
where
you
are
than
to
be
alone
as
a
matter
of
fact
there
are
several
of
those
glib
statements
of
yours
i
could
quarrel
with
if
i
wished
well
your
manner
he
admitted
is
rather
difficult
no
one
could
call
you
particularly
amiable
as
to
not
being
attractive
however
i
differ
from
you
i
think
if
you
took
the
slightest
trouble
about
yourself
put
your
hat
on
straight
for
instance
gathered
up
those
wisps
of
hair
and
indulged
in
a
smile
now
and
then
you
would
be
distinctly
for
a
moment
her
frown
seemed
even
a
little
more
sullen
than
ever
there
was
a
positive
scowl
upon
her
face
until
to
his
amazement
she
suddenly
burst
out
laughing
he
saw
then
that
she
had
the
whitest
of
teeth
and
the
little
flush
of
colour
which
had
been
gradually
finding
its
way
into
her
cheeks
completely
dispelled
the
sallowness
of
her
complexion
her
eyes
seemed
to
reflect
her
unexpectedly
kindled
sense
of
humour
she
straightened
her
hat
and
felt
her
hair
you
really
are
a
very
nice
person
she
said
you
can
go
on
talking
nonsense
if
you
want
to
i
rather
like
it
and
if
it
will
give
you
any
satisfaction
i
will
spend
that
hour
during
which
you
are
going
to
leave
me
alone
in
norwich
at
the
hairdresser
i
knew
i
was
right
he
declared
you
a
good
sort
so
are
you
she
rejoined
let
be
friends
i
am
going
to
start
by
asking
you
a
question
for
god
sake
he
begged
do
ask
me
why
i
came
to
settle
at
market
ballaston
why
not
because
every
one
pestering
me
to
death
with
the
same
thing
he
complained
no
one
can
get
that
murder
out
of
their
heads
it
seems
to
have
absorbed
every
effort
at
individual
thought
in
the
whole
place
why
i
seen
men
killed
by
the
dozen
i
lived
in
a
place
where
there
was
a
murder
every
day
yet
here
they
seem
obsessed
by
their
one
little
tragedy
i
can
never
get
away
from
it
i
go
down
to
the
village
inn
the
tradespeople
are
just
like
the
tradespeople
in
any
other
village
i
should
like
a
little
local
information
and
gossip
not
a
bit
of
it
the
murder
and
nothing
but
the
murder
i
lunch
at
the
hall
before
i
have
been
there
half
an
hour
i
know
that
i
am
an
object
of
suspicion
i
must
have
come
to
the
neighbourhood
because
of
the
murder
hang
it
all
in
i
shall
have
to
set
to
work
and
find
out
who
kill
this
fellow
endacott
and
tell
you
all
about
it
i
hope
you
wo
try
she
begged
earnestly
another
mystery
he
exclaimed
what
the
mischief
can
it
matter
to
you
i
do
know
she
answered
i
do
care
much
about
any
of
these
people
but
i
do
like
unhappiness
the
man
dead
i
think
all
over
the
village
the
same
feeling
exists
i
think
they
are
afraid
of
what
might
happen
if
the
truth
really
came
to
light
she
leaned
a
little
forward
in
the
car
her
eyes
fixed
upon
the
steeple
of
the
cathedral
slowly
emerging
to
definite
form
slender
exquisite
yet
dominating
as
it
rose
from
amongst
an
incongruous
mass
of
buildings
johnson
waited
for
several
moments
then
as
he
swung
into
the
main
road
he
broke
the
brief
silence
that
queer
he
confided
i
had
formed
the
same
impression
myself
anyway
we
will
drop
it
for
the
present
she
nodded
assent
i
wonder
if
you
realise
she
said
what
a
great
holiday
this
is
for
me
i
have
never
been
in
norwich
i
have
not
been
in
a
car
for
years
i
am
enjoying
myself
thoroughly
and
i
am
not
going
to
think
of
another
disagreeable
thing
please
put
me
down
wherever
you
like
and
when
you
have
done
your
business
i
will
meet
you
wherever
you
say
have
you
any
shopping
to
do
beyond
your
visit
to
the
hairdresser
he
asked
her
shopping
she
repeated
scornfully
why
should
i
have
any
living
the
sort
of
life
i
do
one
needs
no
clothes
one
thing
does
as
well
as
another
still
the
hairdresser
will
take
a
little
time
and
i
can
amuse
myself
very
well
looking
at
the
shop
windows
i
shall
put
you
down
in
the
market
place
he
decided
i
shall
be
gone
for
about
three
quarters
of
an
hour
at
the
end
of
that
time
i
will
meet
you
at
the
tea
shop
you
can
see
on
our
right
hand
after
that
if
we
have
any
time
to
spare
we
will
look
round
the
place
together
is
that
agreed
delightful
she
assented
the
chief
constable
was
in
and
happy
to
see
johnson
he
was
an
amiable
as
competent
as
could
be
expected
and
exceedingly
popular
in
the
county
of
which
he
was
a
native
i
am
major
holmes
he
announced
glancing
at
the
card
which
he
still
held
in
his
hand
what
can
i
do
for
you
mr
johnson
give
me
a
little
of
your
time
and
a
great
deal
of
your
patience
was
the
quiet
reply
i
have
just
come
to
live
in
your
county
at
market
ballaston
i
have
taken
the
great
house
there
the
great
house
the
other
repeated
reminiscently
oh
yes
i
remember
of
course
so
you
are
living
there
the
scene
of
a
very
unfortunate
tragedy
which
cost
us
a
lot
of
time
and
trouble
lately
so
i
hear
johnson
murmured
major
holmes
leaned
back
in
his
chair
i
am
afraid
he
confessed
that
norfolk
has
added
to
the
somewhat
scanty
list
of
undiscovered
crimes
we
do
lay
it
too
much
to
heart
however
as
scotland
yard
took
the
whole
business
out
of
our
hands
in
the
early
stages
a
little
unwise
of
them
perhaps
johnson
observed
local
police
may
not
be
so
intelligent
but
they
are
at
least
tenacious
and
they
often
have
the
better
grasp
of
the
situation
the
chief
constable
remained
silent
he
had
his
own
opinion
but
it
was
not
a
matter
for
discussion
with
an
outsider
i
imagine
his
visitor
proceeded
that
it
would
be
rather
a
score
for
the
county
police
if
they
were
to
achieve
a
success
where
scotland
yard
has
failed
major
holmes
glanced
across
at
his
caller
keenly
have
you
brought
me
any
information
he
asked
yes
was
the
laconic
reply
the
chief
constable
was
startled
but
eager
god
bless
my
soul
he
exclaimed
sitting
up
you
a
welcome
visitor
look
here
let
me
ring
for
my
superintendent
johnson
held
out
his
hand
not
for
the
moment
if
you
please
he
begged
i
would
rather
say
what
i
have
to
say
to
you
in
confidence
afterwards
i
understand
the
information
must
be
used
in
such
manner
as
you
think
fit
the
other
nodded
very
well
he
agreed
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
squared
himself
up
to
the
desk
he
was
a
man
to
the
kindly
person
who
had
driven
miss
besant
over
to
norwich
major
holmes
he
said
i
shall
ask
you
to
consider
as
private
so
much
of
this
conversation
as
does
not
come
under
the
heading
of
official
information
certainly
the
murdered
man
endacott
and
i
were
associated
in
a
very
large
business
established
in
china
alexandria
and
new
york
we
were
together
for
over
twenty
years
for
the
last
ten
years
he
was
my
partner
we
wound
up
the
business
a
little
over
twelve
months
ago
and
he
brought
a
great
fortune
to
england
you
were
his
partner
major
holmes
repeated
in
a
tone
of
considerable
surprise
no
one
in
this
neighbourhood
knows
of
my
connection
with
endacott
johnson
continued
i
have
chosen
to
keep
it
secret
now
let
me
come
to
the
more
precise
information
which
i
have
to
offer
a
month
or
so
before
endacott
left
the
east
a
chinese
temple
near
pekin
was
robbed
and
two
statues
wooden
images
they
were
with
a
very
peculiar
history
were
stolen
there
were
two
young
men
concerned
in
the
robbery
an
englishman
and
an
american
the
american
got
as
far
as
the
railway
and
although
he
was
murdered
by
a
band
of
robbers
who
boarded
the
train
one
of
the
images
reached
its
destination
the
englishman
was
captured
by
the
priests
and
as
by
their
religion
they
are
unable
to
shed
blood
he
was
handed
over
by
them
to
a
notorious
river
pirate
with
instructions
that
he
was
to
be
thrown
to
the
alligators
i
heard
of
the
affair
in
a
village
where
i
was
trading
up
the
river
rescued
him
from
the
pirate
and
brought
him
down
to
the
coast
the
name
of
the
young
man
was
gregory
ballaston
the
chief
constable
stared
across
the
table
it
was
an
odd
story
to
hear
told
in
such
a
way
in
the
city
of
norwich
greg
ballaston
he
exclaimed
good
lord
gregory
ballaston
the
narrator
continued
found
his
image
waiting
for
him
on
the
steamer
although
his
friend
was
dead
the
second
of
the
images
with
which
the
robbers
had
decamped
came
by
means
of
indirect
traffic
with
them
into
my
possession
i
showed
it
to
ballaston
in
my
warehouse
he
coveted
it
if
the
old
superstition
were
true
his
image
without
mine
was
useless
how
useless
major
holmes
asked
puzzled
because
both
were
supposed
to
contain
hidden
somewhere
in
their
interior
a
sacred
treasure
of
jewels
accumulated
by
the
priests
in
the
temple
if
i
attempt
to
explain
the
matter
more
fully
you
will
think
that
i
am
telling
fairy
stories
so
i
will
content
myself
by
saying
that
according
to
an
ancient
superstition
credited
by
many
who
had
knowledge
of
the
affair
and
also
by
these
two
young
men
the
possession
of
one
image
without
the
other
was
useless
gregory
ballaston
left
for
england
taking
his
image
the
other
when
we
wound
up
the
affairs
of
the
firm
was
brought
home
to
england
by
ralph
endacott
together
with
a
number
of
old
manuscripts
from
the
temple
which
had
also
come
into
our
possession
up
to
at
any
rate
a
few
days
before
his
murder
that
image
stood
in
his
study
the
room
where
he
was
found
shot
that
image
is
in
ballaston
hall
major
holmes
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
without
speaking
it
was
scarcely
to
be
wondered
at
that
his
prevailing
impressions
were
of
blank
incredulity
you
are
telling
me
a
most
extraordinary
story
johnson
he
said
guardedly
the
truth
is
sometimes
extraordinary
the
other
agreed
you
can
easily
verify
however
the
correctness
of
the
main
points
of
my
statements
i
can
give
you
references
for
instance
to
my
bankers
in
london
who
will
assure
you
that
i
was
the
head
of
the
firm
in
which
endacott
was
partner
that
i
am
a
man
of
wealth
and
reputation
and
in
a
position
to
know
the
truth
concerning
these
matters
gregory
ballaston
half
recognised
me
but
as
out
there
i
passed
as
a
chinaman
he
is
only
suspicious
i
adopted
the
garb
and
speech
of
the
chinese
very
early
in
life
because
no
confessed
european
has
a
chance
of
trading
successfully
in
the
interior
of
the
country
gregory
ballaston
is
a
young
man
against
whom
i
have
no
in
fact
i
rather
like
him
but
endacott
was
my
associate
for
twenty
years
and
i
was
responsible
for
the
image
being
in
his
possession
it
was
arranged
between
us
that
with
the
help
of
a
friend
of
his
at
the
british
museum
he
should
obtain
a
translation
of
the
documents
we
had
acquired
concerning
it
and
we
should
then
on
my
return
to
england
discuss
the
possibility
of
the
existence
of
the
jewels
i
am
very
certain
that
in
his
lifetime
he
would
never
willingly
have
parted
with
the
image
to
gregory
ballaston
and
you
say
that
that
image
is
now
at
ballaston
hall
the
major
demanded
it
is
there
at
the
present
moment
was
the
unequivocal
reply
i
lunched
there
and
saw
it
together
with
the
fellow
image
which
gregory
ballaston
brought
home
the
chief
constable
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
the
story
to
which
he
had
listened
was
barely
credible
but
there
was
something
very
convincing
about
this
rather
ponderous
man
of
slow
speech
and
steady
eyes
you
are
a
stranger
in
these
parts
johnson
he
said
after
a
moment
pause
you
probably
do
know
that
the
ballastons
are
one
of
our
oldest
and
most
prominent
county
families
sir
bertram
is
lord
lieutenant
at
the
present
moment
he
hunts
the
hounds
and
occupies
a
great
position
i
am
aware
of
that
johnson
replied
i
also
know
as
probably
you
do
that
the
family
are
in
great
financial
straits
it
comes
to
this
then
the
chief
constable
summed
up
unwillingly
you
are
practically
accusing
young
ballaston
not
only
of
theft
but
of
the
murder
of
your
late
partner
endacott
i
have
not
gone
so
far
as
that
the
other
pointed
out
i
have
supplied
you
with
a
motive
for
the
murder
i
have
given
you
information
that
property
belonging
to
the
dead
man
equally
to
me
is
now
in
the
possession
of
the
ballastons
but
is
this
image
really
of
great
value
major
holmes
asked
leaving
out
the
other
improbabilities
could
its
possession
be
considered
as
a
possible
incentive
for
the
perpetration
of
such
an
atrocious
crime
the
jewels
supposed
to
be
concealed
in
the
two
images
johnson
confided
are
estimated
if
they
exist
at
all
to
be
worth
anything
up
to
a
million
pounds
it
was
sir
bertram
who
first
heard
the
story
when
he
was
in
the
diplomatic
service
and
persona
grata
at
the
late
court
in
china
he
passed
it
on
to
his
son
and
without
doubt
the
two
together
planned
the
expedition
major
holmes
felt
a
certain
amount
of
conviction
creeping
in
upon
him
it
was
only
his
sense
of
officialdom
which
enabled
him
to
conceal
his
growing
sense
of
horror
you
must
forgive
me
johnson
he
begged
if
i
accept
your
story
with
some
reserves
as
a
man
of
common
sense
i
am
sure
you
will
see
that
it
has
its
incredible
side
especially
when
one
considers
the
great
position
of
the
ballastons
and
the
horrible
results
which
must
ensue
if
your
story
be
proved
true
did
i
hear
that
gregory
ballaston
was
going
abroad
again
for
some
years
it
is
that
fact
johnson
admitted
which
has
induced
me
to
pay
you
this
visit
instead
of
pursuing
a
few
investigations
myself
major
holmes
pushed
pen
and
paper
across
the
table
will
you
write
down
the
address
of
your
bankers
he
invited
to
whom
i
may
refer
if
you
also
care
to
give
me
a
reference
to
your
lawyers
or
some
private
person
i
must
confess
that
i
should
proceed
with
more
confidence
johnson
acquiesced
without
hesitation
there
was
something
convincing
about
the
name
of
the
bank
and
the
solicitors
written
in
his
firm
handwriting
you
have
no
further
suggestions
to
make
i
suppose
the
chief
constable
asked
none
at
all
johnson
replied
except
that
i
should
much
prefer
your
keeping
my
intervention
in
this
matter
entirely
secret
for
a
short
time
you
will
probably
place
such
investigations
as
you
decide
to
make
in
the
hands
of
your
subordinate
who
first
took
charge
of
the
case
if
you
can
arrange
to
let
him
pay
me
a
visit
at
the
great
house
i
should
be
glad
major
holmes
sat
for
a
moment
or
two
in
silence
let
me
see
he
reflected
cloutson
was
the
man
who
had
the
matter
in
hand
before
we
were
overrun
by
the
scotland
yard
people
he
is
travelling
inspector
now
for
the
northern
part
of
the
county
i
shall
catch
him
at
lynn
and
will
have
him
return
at
once
there
is
one
thing
more
i
should
tell
you
johnson
concluded
it
was
my
intention
before
i
heard
of
gregory
ballaston
impending
departure
to
deal
with
this
matter
myself
i
have
a
young
man
from
a
private
detective
agency
stationed
down
at
ballaston
he
watches
however
for
one
purpose
only
unless
you
have
any
special
reason
for
not
telling
me
the
chief
constable
suggested
i
think
especially
as
we
are
going
to
act
i
had
better
know
what
that
one
purpose
is
i
anticipate
at
some
time
or
another
johnson
confided
a
burglarious
visit
at
the
great
house
from
some
one
at
ballaston
now
that
i
have
discovered
that
the
image
has
already
been
stolen
the
possibility
is
not
so
great
but
it
is
obvious
that
as
yet
gregory
ballaston
has
not
learned
the
secret
of
helping
himself
to
the
treasure
now
there
is
one
room
an
annex
to
the
study
locked
and
boarded
on
the
windows
of
which
miss
endacott
has
had
bars
placed
i
believed
that
the
image
was
in
there
but
what
certainly
is
there
is
the
coffer
of
chinese
manuscripts
which
endacott
brought
home
with
him
and
which
we
believed
to
contain
instructions
as
to
the
connection
between
the
images
and
the
treasure
i
have
examined
that
room
and
though
of
course
a
professional
burglar
could
manage
it
easily
enough
it
would
be
a
simple
matter
for
an
amateur
to
tackle
still
having
gone
so
far
i
expect
gregory
ballaston
to
make
the
last
effort
that
is
why
my
young
man
watches
ballaston
hall
at
night
major
holmes
was
a
man
of
limited
vision
and
once
more
he
had
the
sensation
of
having
been
plunged
into
a
world
of
phantasies
chinese
manuscripts
he
muttered
images
greg
ballaston
finest
captain
oxford
ever
had
you
know
johnson
and
captained
the
gentlemen
two
years
it
awfully
hard
for
me
to
get
a
coherent
grip
of
this
especially
when
you
sit
there
and
tell
me
that
you
lived
in
the
east
disguised
as
a
chinaman
the
whole
thing
seems
fantastic
johnson
tapped
with
his
forefinger
the
slip
of
paper
upon
which
he
had
written
the
two
addresses
when
you
take
up
my
references
with
the
lawyers
he
suggested
write
to
stockton
personally
ask
him
his
opinion
of
me
as
a
man
of
business
a
practical
man
you
can
have
him
down
if
you
like
my
affairs
are
of
some
importance
to
him
and
he
would
not
hesitate
to
make
the
journey
you
must
have
confidence
in
me
because
now
that
i
have
moved
in
the
matter
at
all
i
wish
to
be
sure
of
the
end
major
holmes
rose
to
his
feet
and
opened
the
door
for
his
visitor
you
can
rely
upon
my
taking
the
necessary
steps
in
the
matter
he
promised
the
whole
business
is
more
painful
to
me
than
i
can
tell
you
but
it
will
proceed
from
now
on
automatically
i
will
send
inspector
cloutson
in
to
see
you
the
first
time
he
is
at
market
ballaston
johnson
as
he
walked
down
the
hill
from
the
castle
glanced
more
than
once
at
the
grim
jail
with
its
walls
and
bare
windows
he
was
no
sentimentalist
fifteen
years
trading
upon
the
river
had
accustomed
him
to
scenes
of
horror
and
bloodshed
but
nevertheless
he
gave
a
little
shiver
as
he
passed
the
entrance
it
was
here
only
a
week
ago
that
a
man
had
been
hanged
he
recalled
the
circumstances
only
to
dismiss
the
memory
immediately
he
was
concerned
with
more
immediate
events
he
himself
had
started
into
relentless
motion
the
cumbersome
machinery
of
the
law
the
memory
of
the
chief
constable
room
waxed
faint
the
tolling
of
the
castle
clock
startled
him
he
glanced
up
above
was
the
scaffold
chapter
vii
johnson
was
genuinely
surprised
at
the
expression
in
his
face
when
at
the
end
of
that
drive
home
through
the
drowsy
afternoon
she
put
out
her
hand
to
wish
him
he
forgot
her
shabby
little
black
lace
hat
with
its
two
rather
battered
red
roses
her
scratched
and
mended
gloves
the
thin
wrap
around
her
linen
frock
she
was
no
longer
a
sulky
tired
young
woman
for
a
single
moment
she
was
beautiful
you
have
given
me
quite
a
wonderful
afternoon
johnson
she
said
and
i
am
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
been
so
quiet
all
the
way
home
i
am
afraid
i
must
have
seemed
almost
ungracious
i
was
i
was
just
enjoying
it
all
and
thank
you
she
was
gone
before
he
could
do
anything
but
return
heartily
the
warm
pressure
of
her
fingers
but
she
seemed
to
him
to
walk
with
a
new
grace
as
she
stepped
lightly
up
the
tiled
path
turned
the
shining
brass
door
handle
and
disappeared
into
the
little
house
he
turned
round
to
his
car
but
instead
of
making
for
his
own
heavy
oak
gates
he
reversed
slowly
down
the
lane
swung
round
in
front
of
the
ballaston
arms
and
entered
the
same
little
company
were
assembled
in
the
bar
with
the
exception
of
rawson
and
the
addition
of
walter
beavens
the
local
wheelwright
and
tom
foulds
the
veterinary
surgeon
good
afternoon
gentlemen
johnson
said
cheerfully
a
long
and
dusty
ride
from
norwich
landlord
i
take
a
whisky
and
soda
a
large
soda
please
and
a
piece
of
lemon
if
you
have
such
a
thing
he
settled
down
into
a
chair
with
the
air
of
a
man
who
intends
to
make
himself
at
home
and
began
to
fill
his
pipe
craske
was
his
immediate
neighbour
a
little
distance
away
the
young
man
fielding
was
busy
with
a
box
of
flies
so
you
had
a
look
at
the
hall
this
morning
sir
the
grocer
remarked
i
saw
you
coming
through
the
gates
i
lunched
there
johnson
confided
a
magnificent
place
it
is
and
full
of
treasures
too
why
the
pictures
and
tapestries
alone
must
be
worth
a
fortune
foulds
joined
in
the
conversation
he
was
a
young
man
inclined
to
be
stout
dressed
in
somewhat
sporting
fashion
with
riding
leggings
which
he
was
continually
tapping
with
a
switch
worth
a
mint
of
money
those
tapestries
he
declared
came
from
versailles
some
of
them
the
more
modern
ones
at
the
time
of
the
revolution
good
pictures
too
any
quantity
of
them
i
should
say
the
contents
of
the
hall
were
worth
the
best
part
of
half
a
million
queer
situation
ai
it
in
what
way
johnson
enquired
the
young
man
wielded
his
switch
assiduously
well
it
no
secret
round
here
he
proclaimed
dropping
his
voice
nevertheless
that
sir
bertram
is
devilish
hard
up
they
do
know
where
to
turn
for
money
any
of
them
and
yet
with
all
that
valuable
property
they
ca
touch
it
how
that
every
yard
of
tapestry
every
picture
worth
a
snap
of
the
fingers
is
an
heirloom
foulds
explained
every
acre
of
property
is
entailed
i
suppose
there
plenty
of
money
been
raised
on
mortgages
but
i
think
they
come
to
the
end
of
that
from
what
one
hears
shame
too
fine
old
family
sir
bertram
i
suppose
has
been
extravagant
johnson
suggested
the
veterinary
surgeon
glanced
around
well
he
said
our
friend
rawson
being
absent
we
may
venture
to
speak
of
his
lordship
of
the
manor
freely
there
is
a
person
in
the
county
could
find
a
word
to
say
against
him
him
or
gregory
either
but
i
should
say
that
for
making
the
money
fly
they
are
just
about
the
limit
gregory
is
reputed
to
have
led
a
very
fast
life
in
town
the
grocer
interposed
timidly
and
then
i
do
know
as
he
was
a
patch
on
his
father
was
the
veterinary
surgeon
complacent
rejoinder
henry
seems
to
be
the
sober
one
of
the
family
johnson
remarked
he
a
character
he
is
foulds
declared
a
real
dickens
character
you
right
about
him
being
the
sober
one
though
he
never
spend
a
sixpence
he
could
help
and
i
back
his
conscience
against
the
archbishop
of
canterbury
have
a
drink
mr
craske
with
pleasure
tom
will
you
honour
me
mr
johnson
the
honour
is
mine
as
the
thirst
certainly
is
was
the
prompt
response
very
kind
of
you
i
am
sure
the
young
man
fielding
having
succeeded
with
his
fly
entered
diffidently
into
the
conversation
have
the
family
a
town
house
he
enquired
not
now
craske
replied
there
was
one
in
grosvenor
square
but
that
went
ten
years
ago
the
year
sir
bertram
lost
seventy
thousand
pounds
on
the
derby
they
spend
most
of
their
time
down
here
then
i
suppose
i
would
say
that
the
grocer
rejoined
gregory
soon
after
the
war
disappeared
altogether
for
a
year
or
so
and
he
always
taking
long
trips
abroad
the
squire
he
just
goes
up
to
those
things
that
the
gentry
from
everywhere
seem
to
meet
at
the
eton
and
harrow
and
varsity
cricket
matches
at
lord
and
ascot
and
goodwood
johnson
made
an
effort
to
bring
the
discussion
back
to
what
was
to
him
its
point
of
greatest
interest
these
financial
embarrassments
of
sir
bertram
and
his
son
he
said
i
presume
there
is
nothing
absolutely
urgent
about
them
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
admit
that
foulds
replied
cautiously
there
was
a
rumour
yesterday
that
there
was
a
conference
of
lawyers
in
london
fixed
for
next
week
jenkins
from
norwich
he
the
lawyer
who
deals
chiefly
with
the
mortgages
he
did
say
last
week
that
they
could
see
the
year
through
the
entrance
of
rawson
interfered
with
the
trend
of
the
conversation
it
was
a
matter
of
etiquette
at
the
ballaston
arms
that
gossip
concerning
the
hall
was
not
indulged
in
while
he
was
present
unless
he
himself
introduced
the
subject
the
butler
greeted
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
with
the
slightly
extra
respect
to
which
his
recent
visit
entitled
him
glad
to
see
you
at
the
hall
with
us
sir
he
remarked
you
will
find
the
squire
a
kindly
gentleman
and
hospitable
when
he
takes
the
fancy
i
found
him
most
agreeable
johnson
acknowledged
i
enjoyed
very
much
too
my
brief
glimpse
of
your
marvellous
art
treasures
marvellous
they
are
rawson
sighed
as
he
held
up
his
glass
to
the
light
a
bit
of
tantalisation
about
them
though
as
you
might
say
hundreds
of
thousands
there
doing
nobody
any
good
by
the
way
johnson
continued
there
were
two
wonderfully
carved
wooden
images
in
henry
room
do
they
set
much
store
by
them
i
should
say
they
did
sir
rather
a
curious
thing
about
those
images
one
of
them
is
damned
ugly
that
the
one
gregory
sent
home
from
abroad
and
that
henry
seemed
to
take
a
fancy
to
gregory
himself
he
has
a
sort
of
dislike
to
it
all
the
time
it
was
in
henry
room
alone
he
never
went
in
if
he
could
help
it
then
about
a
year
ago
the
other
one
turned
up
a
nice
bit
of
work
that
side
by
side
now
and
gregory
do
seem
to
mind
i
seen
him
handling
them
and
looking
at
them
for
hour
after
hour
and
sir
bertram
too
there
a
man
been
down
from
london
to
examine
them
made
me
think
they
might
be
worth
a
bit
of
money
i
should
think
they
very
likely
might
be
johnson
agreed
it
a
curious
thing
the
butler
observed
filling
his
pipe
that
more
than
once
the
squire
has
been
for
having
them
broken
up
but
gregory
would
listen
to
it
they
had
almost
words
about
it
one
night
broken
up
johnson
repeated
for
what
purpose
i
could
quite
follow
the
argument
sir
rawson
admitted
the
squire
seemed
serious
enough
at
the
time
but
gregory
had
his
own
way
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
rose
to
his
feet
a
few
minutes
later
and
amidst
a
little
chorus
of
good
evenings
strolled
out
and
starting
his
car
drove
slowly
up
the
lane
homewards
afterwards
he
left
the
paved
courtyard
by
a
side
entrance
and
paused
for
a
minute
or
two
to
look
around
lovingly
at
the
old
kitchen
garden
the
peaches
ripening
upon
the
wall
the
apple
and
pear
trees
full
of
fruit
the
paths
and
the
little
patches
of
cottage
flowers
in
unexpected
places
he
walked
contentedly
around
his
property
his
hands
behind
his
back
his
pipe
still
in
his
mouth
looked
into
his
tomato
house
and
approved
of
its
appearance
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
gardener
about
the
trimming
of
a
hedge
and
passed
out
on
to
the
lawn
here
he
drew
a
chair
into
the
shade
of
a
cedar
tree
and
still
in
a
reflective
frame
of
mind
leaned
back
with
eyes
his
peaceful
surroundings
seemed
to
fade
away
from
him
he
was
back
in
the
steep
tangled
streets
of
a
chinese
city
on
a
out
in
the
country
travelling
up
to
the
top
of
a
hill
beyond
which
through
the
wood
gleamed
the
green
dome
of
the
temple
of
he
was
back
on
the
turgid
river
where
the
cruel
sun
was
blistering
the
deck
of
his
strange
craft
and
the
sound
of
his
little
engine
suddenly
breaking
the
hot
silence
brought
consternation
to
the
tall
evil
figure
who
had
been
leaning
over
the
side
of
his
boat
to
watch
the
oars
thrust
through
the
opened
places
he
watched
the
coming
to
life
of
the
young
englishman
heard
his
talk
fancied
that
he
smelled
again
the
peculiar
odours
of
that
strange
warehouse
he
saw
endacott
once
more
in
his
quaint
costume
immersed
in
his
beloved
labours
dead
now
for
the
sake
of
the
treasure
which
was
still
withheld
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
sat
there
until
a
very
slight
breeze
stirred
the
leaves
of
the
tall
elm
trees
and
the
church
clock
from
across
the
way
struck
seven
then
he
rose
to
his
feet
knocked
out
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
entered
the
house
that
rustle
of
west
breeze
which
heralding
eventide
broke
the
calm
of
the
summer
day
did
not
as
usual
die
away
with
the
setting
of
the
sun
a
little
bank
of
clouds
crept
up
from
the
horizon
and
the
wind
which
seemed
to
come
suddenly
from
nowhere
bent
the
tops
of
the
trees
and
drove
them
before
it
in
black
and
broken
pieces
the
afterglow
from
the
sunset
passed
into
a
stormy
obscurity
no
rain
fell
but
the
wind
ever
increased
in
volume
and
the
darkness
grew
thicker
johnson
drank
his
accustomed
whisky
and
soda
at
ten
and
retired
to
his
room
a
few
minutes
later
he
lay
down
however
with
a
small
alarm
watch
by
his
side
and
at
three
he
left
the
silent
house
passed
through
the
postern
gate
and
into
the
street
the
morning
darkness
at
first
baffled
him
he
had
to
feel
the
wall
to
know
where
he
was
he
stood
there
with
the
palm
of
his
hand
flat
against
it
looking
in
the
direction
of
the
hall
suddenly
from
the
middle
of
the
gulf
of
darkness
three
little
flashes
of
light
followed
one
another
quickly
there
was
a
brief
pause
then
two
more
then
one
johnson
turned
hurriedly
back
to
the
house
changed
from
his
sleeping
attire
and
dressing
gown
back
into
his
discarded
dinner
clothes
slipped
some
cartridges
into
a
revolver
which
he
took
from
his
bedside
and
descending
the
stairs
carefully
passed
into
the
library
silence
still
reigned
throughout
the
house
and
complete
darkness
johnson
with
the
composed
mien
and
even
pulse
of
a
man
who
is
used
to
dangers
settled
down
to
wait
chapter
viii
towards
five
in
the
morning
johnson
was
awakened
from
a
heavy
slumber
by
the
clamorous
and
increasing
twitter
of
birds
in
the
shrubberies
and
gardens
outside
he
woke
with
the
sensation
of
being
exceedingly
uncomfortable
and
of
being
in
an
entirely
unaccustomed
spot
he
sat
up
looking
around
him
he
was
on
the
floor
of
the
library
his
revolver
with
one
barrel
discharged
by
his
side
a
dried
but
painful
cut
upon
his
cheek
bone
and
with
the
haunting
remains
of
a
most
unpleasant
odour
still
hanging
about
the
room
he
staggered
to
his
feet
with
poignant
apprehensions
of
disaster
a
panel
in
the
door
communicating
with
the
smaller
apartment
which
it
had
been
his
purpose
to
guard
had
been
neatly
cut
out
and
the
spring
lock
apparently
picked
from
the
other
side
the
door
itself
stood
open
inside
the
coffer
in
which
endacott
had
kept
his
manuscripts
lay
upside
down
and
empty
upon
the
carpet
johnson
nodded
slowly
to
himself
it
was
a
moment
of
great
humiliation
after
fifteen
years
of
adventurous
life
of
scraps
with
chinese
cutthroats
malay
thieves
scamps
of
every
sort
armed
with
every
kind
of
weapon
he
had
notwithstanding
ample
warning
been
tricked
by
an
amateur
he
made
a
closer
examination
and
realised
how
it
must
have
happened
he
had
waited
in
the
darkness
for
the
opening
of
the
garden
door
and
the
intruder
whoever
it
might
have
been
had
surprised
him
by
coming
in
the
other
way
there
were
after
all
a
dozen
windows
on
the
ground
floor
by
which
he
might
have
entered
and
stealing
upon
him
from
behind
he
could
recall
even
then
with
his
dazed
senses
as
he
leaned
out
to
get
a
little
fresh
air
the
absolute
noiselessness
of
that
encounter
it
was
less
a
sound
than
the
consciousness
of
somebody
presence
which
had
made
him
suddenly
alert
and
then
before
he
could
even
turn
arms
like
iron
bands
were
around
his
throat
and
the
handkerchief
was
pressed
to
his
nostrils
night
after
night
he
had
waited
for
what
had
happened
and
when
his
opportunity
had
come
well
this
was
the
end
of
it
he
moved
to
the
telephone
rang
up
the
police
station
and
after
a
few
minutes
delay
conducted
a
conversation
with
the
inspector
in
charge
afterwards
he
locked
up
the
library
proceeded
upstairs
took
a
bath
changed
into
his
ordinary
tweed
morning
clothes
and
drank
several
cups
of
tea
disturbed
at
all
during
the
night
morton
he
asked
the
butler
ca
say
that
i
was
sir
the
man
replied
looking
curiously
at
the
slight
wound
on
his
master
face
you
sleep
well
then
was
the
latter
dry
comment
there
was
a
burglary
here
between
three
and
four
keep
your
mouth
shut
until
after
the
police
have
been
god
bless
my
soul
sir
the
man
exclaimed
you
look
as
though
been
hurt
sir
nothing
to
speak
of
i
heard
a
noise
and
went
down
fellow
got
at
me
before
i
could
turn
the
light
on
remember
not
a
word
morton
the
police
sergeant
will
be
here
in
a
few
minutes
the
sergeant
came
a
tall
and
ponderous
man
slow
of
speech
persistent
and
given
to
repetitions
he
spent
a
thoroughly
enjoyable
hour
notebook
in
hand
on
a
blank
page
of
which
he
made
a
rough
sketch
of
the
room
itself
and
the
window
through
which
it
was
discovered
that
the
intruder
had
entered
and
you
miss
nothing
of
value
in
any
other
part
of
the
house
sir
he
enquired
for
the
sixth
or
seventh
time
prior
to
taking
his
leave
nothing
that
i
can
trace
johnson
replied
you
must
remember
that
i
am
only
a
nothing
of
my
own
is
missing
nor
any
of
the
familiar
objects
in
the
library
the
sergeant
returned
the
book
to
his
pocket
a
mysterious
affair
he
pronounced
nothing
gone
apparently
but
a
pile
of
old
papers
we
must
telephone
to
the
lawyers
who
let
the
place
and
interview
the
tenant
the
inspector
will
be
over
this
afternoon
sir
and
i
dare
say
he
will
be
along
to
see
you
the
man
took
his
leave
and
johnson
crossed
the
road
and
knocked
at
the
door
of
the
little
house
miss
besant
opened
it
herself
and
greeted
him
with
a
smile
i
was
just
coming
across
she
said
madame
wants
to
see
you
johnson
was
ushered
into
the
cool
where
madame
was
lying
upon
her
couch
she
held
out
one
hand
and
with
the
other
waved
imperiously
to
miss
besant
to
depart
something
has
happened
something
happened
last
night
she
exclaimed
what
was
it
he
took
the
chair
to
which
she
pointed
close
to
her
side
a
burglary
he
confided
i
was
coming
in
to
ask
you
to
communicate
at
once
with
miss
endacott
the
whole
of
the
papers
in
the
chest
which
was
locked
up
in
the
inner
library
are
gone
the
burglar
she
demanded
breathlessly
has
he
been
caught
is
there
any
clue
not
at
present
johnson
acknowledged
there
has
been
much
time
he
got
away
then
yes
he
got
away
she
looked
at
the
scar
on
her
visitor
face
did
you
see
him
she
asked
i
did
see
him
but
i
felt
him
johnson
rejoined
a
little
ruefully
we
had
scarcely
more
than
a
few
seconds
scrap
in
the
dark
he
came
up
from
behind
with
a
chloroformed
handkerchief
she
lay
back
and
closed
her
eyes
in
a
moment
or
two
she
seemed
to
recover
herself
papers
nothing
but
papers
stolen
she
murmured
that
does
sound
like
an
ordinary
burglary
it
was
he
agreed
what
do
you
think
about
it
she
asked
eagerly
what
is
there
to
think
he
rejoined
some
one
wanted
those
papers
we
must
communicate
with
miss
endacott
at
once
and
ascertain
what
they
were
and
to
whom
they
would
be
of
value
you
need
trouble
to
do
that
madame
confided
my
niece
will
be
here
this
afternoon
she
is
coming
down
to
stay
with
me
for
a
few
days
johnson
was
thoughtful
for
a
moment
or
two
well
he
observed
it
is
perhaps
opportune
what
do
you
mean
by
that
she
demanded
nervously
clasping
and
unclasping
her
fingers
he
laid
his
hand
upon
hers
soothingly
you
are
distressing
yourself
needlessly
madame
he
said
i
only
mean
that
her
visit
will
make
it
unnecessary
for
us
to
communicate
with
her
she
will
be
able
to
tell
us
whether
the
papers
were
of
great
value
there
was
another
silence
i
think
i
can
solve
that
problem
madame
declared
they
are
of
no
value
at
all
the
coffer
contained
a
collection
of
chinese
manuscripts
some
of
which
my
brother
had
already
translated
and
a
few
others
which
he
had
not
examined
is
that
so
johnson
observed
seems
queer
does
it
if
that
was
all
that
there
should
be
bars
on
the
windows
and
a
double
lock
on
the
door
my
niece
will
explain
that
madame
replied
there
was
one
which
he
translated
just
before
he
died
which
might
have
had
some
value
claire
did
not
feel
like
examining
it
at
the
time
she
wished
it
kept
safely
however
i
see
johnson
murmured
what
do
the
police
say
about
it
she
demanded
so
far
was
the
somewhat
sardonic
rejoinder
the
police
have
been
represented
by
sergeant
may
his
opinion
is
i
think
that
it
is
a
mysterious
affair
what
do
you
think
of
it
yourself
she
asked
him
suddenly
i
think
he
replied
that
the
burglar
whoever
he
was
was
after
those
chinese
manuscripts
and
nothing
else
therefore
i
do
think
it
was
an
ordinary
sort
of
burglar
at
all
i
should
say
not
it
was
some
one
who
knew
what
he
wanted
and
he
seems
to
have
got
it
i
wish
i
knew
the
truth
about
you
madame
sighed
he
smiled
well
he
said
i
a
pretty
obvious
sort
of
person
are
i
no
she
answered
on
the
contrary
you
puzzle
me
you
frighten
me
just
why
at
the
present
moment
he
asked
tolerantly
because
she
confided
her
eyes
fixed
upon
his
i
do
understand
what
you
were
doing
in
the
lane
out
by
your
gate
this
morning
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
burglary
did
you
see
me
he
enquired
after
a
moment
pause
yes
i
have
seen
you
there
other
mornings
at
the
same
time
what
do
you
do
for
whom
do
you
watch
i
am
a
light
sleeper
he
explained
last
night
i
fancied
that
i
heard
some
one
stirring
i
had
a
walk
round
the
place
as
it
happens
you
see
i
was
right
she
shook
her
head
you
were
out
in
the
lane
she
persisted
perhaps
you
think
i
committed
the
burglary
myself
he
suggested
the
eyes
which
were
fixed
upon
his
so
steadily
grew
even
more
intense
i
should
not
be
surprised
she
said
i
should
not
be
surprised
at
anything
i
heard
about
you
i
do
not
believe
that
any
of
the
stories
you
tell
about
yourself
are
true
you
frighten
me
living
there
i
hate
it
you
have
nothing
to
fear
from
me
he
assured
her
i
am
a
very
harmless
person
but
you
have
told
the
truth
about
yourself
she
persisted
there
was
the
sound
of
hoofs
in
the
lane
madame
looked
out
of
the
window
and
a
wonderful
light
swept
over
her
face
sir
bertram
was
dismounting
from
the
hack
which
he
had
ridden
across
the
park
he
handed
the
reins
to
the
roadmender
who
came
hobbling
up
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
with
the
familiarity
of
habitude
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
immediately
afterwards
entered
the
he
nodded
to
johnson
as
he
came
over
to
madame
with
outstretched
hands
dear
angèle
he
said
you
see
i
anticipated
the
time
of
my
usual
call
i
thought
perhaps
that
this
news
might
have
upset
you
you
have
heard
then
she
exclaimed
a
lurid
account
of
the
affair
was
served
up
with
my
morning
tea
sir
bertram
replied
my
commiserations
johnson
i
am
relieved
to
find
you
in
such
good
shape
however
the
least
sensational
story
is
that
you
were
battered
almost
to
death
by
several
ruffians
and
had
already
been
moved
to
norwich
infirmary
the
report
johnson
declared
is
exaggerated
anything
of
value
gone
the
newcomer
enquired
miss
endacott
is
the
only
one
who
can
tell
us
that
was
the
quiet
answer
the
box
containing
her
uncle
manuscripts
was
broken
open
and
the
manuscripts
themselves
have
disappeared
sir
bertram
drew
up
a
chair
and
lit
one
of
the
cigarettes
from
the
box
which
madame
pushed
towards
him
his
long
lean
figure
looked
at
its
best
in
the
riding
clothes
he
was
wearing
the
summer
had
brought
an
extra
tinge
of
brown
sunburn
into
his
cheeks
his
eyes
were
bright
and
clear
he
seemed
in
the
best
of
spirits
and
health
that
lends
quite
a
note
of
romance
to
the
affair
he
remarked
i
wonder
what
our
local
sherlock
holmes
will
make
of
it
he
has
pronounced
the
affair
mysterious
johnson
confided
i
find
it
so
myself
he
continued
a
moment
later
one
would
not
have
imagined
that
there
were
many
people
with
a
craze
for
chinese
manuscripts
more
useful
to
us
than
any
one
sir
bertram
remarked
gregory
has
a
couple
of
wonderful
wooden
images
up
at
the
hall
you
seen
them
johnson
which
are
supposed
to
be
full
of
jewels
if
we
could
only
discover
the
key
that
poor
fellow
endacott
knew
all
about
it
he
was
at
work
on
some
papers
which
he
had
brought
home
with
him
from
china
just
before
his
death
but
up
to
then
he
had
not
come
across
anything
that
helped
us
johnson
rose
to
his
feet
if
i
might
be
permitted
to
pay
my
respects
to
miss
endacott
as
soon
as
she
arrives
he
begged
i
should
be
glad
certainly
madame
assented
is
miss
endacott
expected
here
sir
bertram
asked
this
afternoon
she
replied
i
only
heard
last
night
for
a
single
second
there
was
a
curious
change
in
sir
bertram
face
the
insouciance
almost
the
gaiety
seemed
suddenly
to
have
fallen
away
as
though
it
had
been
a
mask
his
eyes
were
hard
and
tired
then
he
recovered
himself
opportune
he
remarked
lightly
come
and
see
us
again
soon
up
at
the
hall
mr
johnson
the
latter
bowed
to
madame
and
turned
away
there
was
something
almost
menacing
in
his
gravity
you
are
very
kind
sir
bertram
he
said
as
he
took
his
leave
chapter
ix
johnson
returned
to
find
a
motor
car
standing
outside
his
door
and
major
holmes
with
a
subordinate
in
colloquy
with
morton
he
led
them
himself
to
the
library
showed
them
the
door
with
its
picked
lock
the
empty
coffer
and
the
window
on
the
ground
floor
through
which
the
marauder
had
made
an
easy
entrance
the
chief
constable
was
perplexed
you
are
only
a
here
i
understand
mr
johnson
he
asked
only
a
the
latter
acknowledged
and
you
yourself
have
never
been
in
this
room
i
gather
that
it
was
locked
up
by
miss
endacott
instructions
quite
so
then
you
really
do
know
what
has
been
taken
the
contents
of
the
coffer
evidently
johnson
replied
it
was
always
understood
that
it
contained
chinese
manuscripts
which
endacott
brought
home
with
him
from
abroad
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
major
holmes
continued
i
have
told
inspector
cloutson
here
he
said
of
your
visit
to
me
and
of
my
suspicions
yes
the
inspector
coughed
he
had
a
heavy
but
ingenuous
countenance
disbelief
was
stamped
upon
it
will
you
gentlemen
follow
me
johnson
invited
he
led
them
on
to
the
lawn
well
away
from
the
house
at
a
safe
distance
he
came
to
a
standstill
and
pointed
to
the
library
endacott
he
said
was
murdered
for
the
possession
of
that
other
wooden
image
and
for
the
manuscript
which
indicated
the
whereabouts
of
the
jewels
the
object
of
the
murder
was
achieved
in
part
a
wooden
image
was
taken
you
will
find
it
now
at
ballaston
hall
for
some
reason
or
another
the
murderer
failed
to
secure
the
document
he
probably
heard
some
movement
in
the
house
the
burglary
last
night
was
undertaken
to
secure
it
nothing
else
was
touched
but
the
manuscripts
are
missing
the
only
person
to
whom
the
manuscripts
are
useful
is
the
possessor
of
the
images
inspector
cloutson
stroked
his
chin
thoughtfully
he
looked
across
towards
the
great
front
of
the
hall
his
was
not
the
type
of
brain
to
quickly
absorb
suspicion
and
much
of
this
talk
concerning
wooden
images
and
chinese
manuscripts
he
looked
upon
as
fantastic
almost
as
fantastic
as
the
idea
that
a
member
of
one
of
the
great
county
families
whom
he
revered
could
so
far
forget
their
lofty
station
as
to
commit
a
misdemeanour
under
the
shadow
of
the
law
crime
in
inspector
opinion
was
for
the
criminals
the
idea
of
a
ballaston
as
a
criminal
was
grotesque
you
refer
to
the
ballastons
major
holmes
observed
after
a
pause
johnson
inclined
his
head
i
refer
to
the
ballastons
he
assented
wait
please
a
moment
morton
came
towards
them
followed
by
the
young
man
who
was
interested
in
moths
johnson
welcomed
him
pleasantly
but
with
no
indication
of
intimacy
glad
to
see
you
fielding
he
said
i
sent
word
down
that
those
trout
flies
had
arrived
i
show
them
to
you
directly
that
will
do
morton
the
butler
departed
johnson
turned
to
the
chief
constable
this
is
mr
fielding
he
announced
he
is
a
member
of
the
firm
of
watts
and
fielding
private
enquiry
agents
he
has
been
staying
in
the
neighbourhood
for
the
last
month
making
a
few
investigations
for
me
the
relations
between
the
accredited
representatives
of
the
law
and
a
private
enquiry
agent
were
scarcely
likely
to
be
cordial
major
holmes
however
nodded
slightly
to
some
extent
as
i
told
you
i
have
been
anticipating
last
visit
johnson
continued
mr
fielding
therefore
has
spent
a
considerable
portion
of
his
time
after
midnight
watching
the
egress
from
the
hall
he
will
tell
you
that
this
morning
a
man
slipped
out
of
one
of
the
side
entrances
a
door
in
fact
which
opened
from
the
small
library
into
the
garden
at
ten
minutes
past
three
and
that
he
followed
him
to
this
house
is
that
a
fact
the
chief
constable
asked
gravely
that
is
a
fact
fielding
replied
i
am
prepared
to
swear
to
it
did
you
recognise
the
man
major
holmes
enquired
the
other
shook
his
head
i
was
obeying
orders
in
keeping
strictly
out
of
sight
he
explained
i
was
not
near
enough
to
recognise
him
once
before
some
one
left
by
the
same
door
at
about
the
same
time
but
he
looked
behind
in
the
park
and
saw
me
so
nothing
happened
if
you
saw
this
person
enter
these
premises
at
that
hour
of
the
morning
the
chief
constable
enquired
why
did
you
not
follow
in
case
johnson
needed
assistance
my
express
orders
were
that
he
should
do
nothing
of
the
sort
the
latter
intervened
i
wished
for
many
reasons
to
keep
the
matter
in
my
own
hands
i
have
been
used
to
scraps
he
went
on
in
every
part
of
the
world
i
understand
boxing
and
how
to
draw
a
gun
as
quickly
as
any
one
i
never
dreamed
that
i
might
be
outwitted
the
visitor
from
the
hall
who
stole
the
manuscripts
last
night
was
too
clever
for
me
now
sir
johnson
continued
impressively
i
want
everything
done
in
an
orthodox
fashion
and
i
know
very
well
your
prejudice
and
a
very
natural
one
against
the
interference
of
private
detectives
mr
fielding
will
withdraw
from
the
case
from
now
onwards
but
i
do
expect
that
on
the
basis
of
the
information
you
have
already
received
you
will
at
once
proceed
with
the
necessary
enquiries
i
have
no
alternative
but
to
do
so
the
chief
constable
admitted
reluctantly
i
must
warn
you
however
that
i
shall
do
so
in
the
manner
which
seems
to
me
the
most
desirable
i
shall
approach
sir
bertram
himself
you
will
use
your
own
discretion
of
course
johnson
said
but
action
must
be
taken
at
once
there
must
be
time
for
any
one
to
slip
off
abroad
or
anything
of
that
sort
and
i
want
you
to
remember
this
major
when
you
found
last
night
burglar
and
that
ought
not
to
be
a
difficult
job
you
should
also
be
able
to
solve
the
mystery
of
my
poor
friend
endacott
murder
that
may
be
so
johnson
the
other
answered
a
little
sadly
i
can
only
say
that
i
sincerely
hope
not
we
shall
probably
meet
later
in
the
day
i
shall
be
here
or
in
the
neighbourhood
the
other
promised
the
chief
constable
and
his
subordinate
entered
the
car
and
drove
off
they
swung
round
the
corner
of
the
lane
and
a
dozen
curious
pairs
of
eyes
saw
them
turn
in
at
the
park
gates
what
do
you
think
of
this
cloutson
the
former
asked
bunkum
was
the
prompt
reply
that
what
i
think
bunkum
and
between
you
and
me
major
i
do
think
much
of
that
fellow
johnson
a
stranger
to
the
neighbourhood
no
one
knows
anything
about
him
come
here
for
god
knows
why
and
spinning
yarns
like
this
bunkum
is
what
i
think
of
it
and
as
for
this
burglar
who
else
except
that
pettifogging
enquiry
agent
saw
any
one
leave
the
great
house
not
a
soul
we
heard
of
jobs
major
done
from
the
inside
done
by
the
victim
have
we
those
manuscripts
or
whatever
he
calls
them
were
just
as
likely
to
be
valuable
to
johnson
as
to
any
one
else
supposing
he
wanted
them
well
he
gone
the
best
way
he
could
to
help
himself
if
you
ask
me
what
i
think
about
our
present
errand
sir
i
should
call
it
a
nothing
more
nor
less
my
idea
of
the
job
is
to
get
johnson
dossier
and
search
the
great
house
the
chief
constable
smiled
he
had
not
fully
confided
in
his
subordinate
yet
when
he
came
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
bona
fides
had
not
yet
been
established
in
the
depths
of
his
companion
bucolic
mind
might
lurk
after
all
the
germ
of
truth
chapter
x
so
far
as
the
countenance
of
so
perfect
a
servant
as
rawson
could
betray
any
expression
at
all
there
was
both
welcome
and
a
suggestion
of
hospitality
in
his
manner
as
he
received
the
callers
certainly
sir
bertram
was
in
gregory
was
in
and
henry
was
in
sir
bertram
appeared
almost
at
that
moment
coming
out
of
the
gun
room
with
a
rook
rifle
under
his
arm
hullo
major
he
exclaimed
genially
glad
to
see
you
warned
in
for
lunch
i
hope
very
much
obliged
sir
bertram
was
the
somewhat
hesitating
reply
to
tell
you
the
truth
ah
business
i
see
the
other
interrupted
come
along
to
my
den
it
is
so
long
since
i
signed
a
warrant
that
upon
my
word
i
forgot
i
was
a
magistrate
bring
the
inspector
with
you
if
you
want
him
he
led
the
way
to
a
small
and
seldom
used
room
plainly
furnished
where
he
was
accustomed
at
times
to
interview
a
tenant
seated
himself
on
an
uncomfortable
chair
before
a
desk
and
pointed
to
an
for
his
visitor
nothing
serious
i
hope
he
enquired
major
holmes
waited
until
the
door
was
closed
sir
bertram
he
began
you
have
heard
no
doubt
of
the
burglary
at
the
great
house
my
dear
major
was
the
reproachful
reply
this
is
a
country
village
in
norfolk
and
the
burglary
happened
as
long
ago
as
last
night
i
have
heard
seven
versions
of
the
affair
and
been
given
the
names
of
at
least
seven
suspectedly
guilty
parties
i
have
come
to
call
upon
you
in
connection
with
that
affair
major
holmes
continued
there
is
a
person
willing
to
declare
upon
oath
that
a
quarter
of
an
hour
before
the
burglary
occurred
last
night
some
one
was
seen
to
leave
your
house
cross
the
park
and
enter
the
grounds
of
the
great
house
through
a
gap
in
the
hedge
beyond
the
stable
wall
sir
bertram
sat
quite
still
for
a
moment
then
his
lips
protruded
slightly
and
he
whistled
well
that
the
eighth
version
he
observed
i
like
the
last
one
holmes
spicy
to
say
the
least
of
it
this
is
not
hearsay
the
chief
constable
went
on
i
have
seen
the
witness
myself
and
heard
the
story
from
his
own
lips
i
come
to
you
naturally
for
help
sir
bertram
i
want
a
list
of
your
male
domestics
and
i
wish
to
know
from
your
staff
whether
any
one
was
known
or
heard
to
leave
this
house
last
night
simple
as
sir
bertram
declared
ringing
the
bell
rawson
keeps
tabs
on
them
all
we
a
couple
of
lads
under
footmen
i
suppose
they
call
themselves
whom
i
do
know
much
about
the
others
are
about
as
likely
to
commit
a
burglary
as
i
should
be
to
rob
a
hen
roost
send
rawson
to
me
he
ordered
the
man
who
answered
the
bell
it
was
a
matter
of
seconds
only
before
the
butler
made
his
appearance
his
master
leaned
back
in
his
chair
as
he
questioned
him
rawson
he
asked
do
you
know
any
one
any
man
who
could
have
left
this
house
between
midnight
and
three
or
say
four
this
morning
certainly
not
sir
was
the
confident
reply
you
did
hear
any
unusual
sound
in
the
night
like
a
door
opening
or
anything
of
that
sort
nothing
sir
bertram
if
you
were
told
that
some
one
had
left
this
house
at
about
three
and
gone
down
to
the
great
house
what
should
you
have
to
say
about
it
i
should
say
that
it
was
impossible
sir
rawson
asserted
as
you
are
aware
sir
i
sleep
in
my
own
quarters
adjoining
the
butler
pantry
on
the
ground
floor
my
window
and
door
were
both
wide
open
last
night
and
i
am
a
light
sleeper
i
was
not
once
disturbed
sir
bertram
turned
to
the
chief
constable
did
your
informant
specify
the
door
which
was
made
use
of
it
was
the
door
opening
from
the
smaller
library
sir
bertram
glanced
towards
rawson
see
if
that
door
is
fastened
he
directed
here
you
better
take
the
inspector
with
you
the
two
men
left
the
room
sir
bertram
tapped
a
cigarette
upon
the
table
and
lit
it
where
did
you
get
hold
of
this
story
holmes
he
asked
the
chief
constable
frowned
from
a
perfectly
reliable
source
he
replied
i
have
no
doubt
that
rawson
is
honest
but
i
shall
want
the
names
of
all
your
servants
i
shall
also
require
to
interview
them
all
sir
bertram
smiled
lord
love
us
you
do
suppose
i
want
to
stand
in
the
way
of
your
duty
holmes
he
said
when
rawson
comes
back
you
shall
have
them
all
up
one
by
one
and
put
them
through
the
mill
there
was
nothing
much
stolen
was
there
i
understand
the
burglar
had
only
tumbled
out
a
coffer
full
of
manuscripts
the
manuscripts
themselves
are
missing
major
holmes
confided
i
have
seen
the
lot
sir
bertram
observed
carelessly
some
of
them
were
curious
there
was
one
of
them
worth
sixpence
intrinsically
endacott
was
supposed
to
have
one
telling
us
all
about
the
treasure
in
my
buddha
heads
but
it
never
materialised
rawson
returned
in
due
course
preceded
by
the
inspector
the
door
is
properly
locked
on
the
inside
sir
the
latter
announced
there
are
no
evidences
of
any
one
having
used
that
way
out
into
the
grounds
lately
so
that
that
sir
bertram
observed
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
how
many
servants
are
there
sleeping
in
the
house
major
holmes
enquired
eleven
sir
rawson
answered
i
shall
require
to
interview
each
one
of
them
get
along
with
it
then
sir
bertram
assented
resignedly
do
forget
we
lunch
at
one
rawson
had
better
take
you
round
to
the
quarters
when
major
holmes
has
finished
rawson
bring
him
out
on
to
the
lawn
and
serve
some
sherry
he
dismissed
them
all
carelessly
with
a
little
wave
of
the
hand
waited
until
the
door
was
closed
waited
until
some
minutes
afterwards
before
his
expression
changed
or
a
sound
escaped
from
his
lips
then
he
rose
slowly
to
his
feet
lit
another
cigarette
and
looked
reproachfully
at
his
shaking
fingers
what
a
nerve
these
great
criminals
must
have
he
murmured
to
himself
as
he
strolled
out
into
the
hall
henry
hullo
henry
a
still
motionless
figure
stood
in
the
shadow
of
the
staircase
on
the
first
landing
looking
downward
a
figure
so
still
that
except
for
his
clothes
he
might
have
stepped
out
of
one
of
the
frames
which
lined
the
wall
are
you
coming
down
or
going
up
or
rooted
sir
bertram
enquired
i
will
descend
henry
ballaston
replied
he
came
down
the
stairs
with
slow
yet
even
footsteps
one
hand
always
upon
the
carved
balustrade
i
heard
voices
he
said
holmes
is
here
from
norwich
sir
bertram
confided
and
the
immortal
cloutson
with
him
you
know
the
travelling
inspector
for
the
district
they
have
an
idea
that
some
one
crossed
the
park
from
the
hall
last
night
in
connection
i
presume
with
the
burglary
at
the
great
house
henry
observed
his
brother
nodded
a
silly
business
have
you
seen
anything
of
gregory
not
since
breakfast
time
he
spoke
of
going
to
norwich
he
found
he
wanted
another
trunk
sir
bertram
sighed
the
brothers
walked
out
together
through
the
fine
gothic
side
entrance
which
led
on
to
the
lawns
and
gardens
you
had
no
communication
from
borroughes
this
morning
i
suppose
henry
ballaston
asked
a
little
hesitatingly
nothing
was
the
level
reply
there
was
a
letter
from
kershaw
the
lawyer
fellow
of
whom
emily
spoke
so
highly
he
said
that
he
had
studied
the
position
from
every
point
of
view
and
regretted
to
find
that
he
could
discover
no
means
remaining
by
which
sufficient
money
to
pay
the
overdue
interest
on
the
first
mortgage
could
be
legitimately
raised
the
timber
will
be
the
only
thing
and
the
timber
is
ballaston
the
timber
is
sacred
henry
agreed
has
kershaw
examined
the
position
so
far
as
regards
the
romneys
and
the
three
gainsboroughs
heirlooms
just
the
same
as
the
others
they
are
not
to
be
touched
the
brothers
stood
side
by
side
upon
the
lawn
their
faces
turned
towards
the
house
sir
bertram
was
his
usual
cool
and
gracious
self
henry
had
somehow
or
other
a
suggestion
of
suspended
life
in
his
colourless
face
his
stiff
attitude
his
cold
eyes
major
holmes
is
examining
the
servants
he
enquired
that
was
his
idea
will
he
wait
until
gregory
returns
very
likely
as
i
think
i
told
you
they
seem
to
have
come
across
some
one
who
can
swear
that
they
saw
a
man
leaving
the
hall
last
night
just
before
the
burglary
took
place
but
there
was
no
actual
burglary
henry
objected
a
quantity
of
documents
appear
to
be
missing
sir
bertram
confided
holmes
attitude
seemed
to
me
a
little
suspicious
i
fancy
that
some
one
has
been
getting
at
him
i
am
not
sure
i
must
confess
to
having
some
doubts
about
this
man
johnson
doubts
explain
yourself
bertram
johnson
account
of
himself
has
never
been
an
entirely
credible
one
do
you
remember
the
day
when
he
lunched
here
and
he
saw
the
images
he
certainly
betrayed
surprise
henry
reflected
gregory
has
a
queer
idea
about
it
although
it
only
made
us
laugh
at
the
time
he
said
he
reminded
him
of
the
chinaman
who
saved
his
life
on
the
river
and
who
was
an
important
person
in
the
firm
of
johnson
and
company
johnson
is
not
a
chinaman
henry
ballaston
replied
confidently
his
brother
took
his
arm
and
moved
towards
the
house
major
holmes
was
standing
in
the
entrance
no
sir
bertram
agreed
but
the
chinaman
might
have
been
mr
johnson
chapter
xi
the
chief
constable
had
little
to
report
but
his
air
of
uneasy
disquietude
remained
i
think
he
announced
that
so
far
as
i
can
make
out
the
servants
are
all
right
curiously
enough
however
it
seems
that
gregory
has
a
key
to
the
door
in
question
which
he
uses
sometimes
very
probable
sir
bertram
assented
he
likes
to
come
and
go
out
of
the
house
at
all
times
i
wonder
when
he
be
back
major
holmes
enquired
he
had
very
little
to
do
his
father
observed
found
himself
a
trunk
short
or
something
of
that
sort
i
thought
he
had
bought
all
his
outfit
in
london
but
i
suppose
he
miscalculated
when
does
he
go
abroad
saturday
week
sails
from
liverpool
to
montreal
i
think
by
an
allan
liner
the
county
will
miss
him
the
chief
constable
remarked
as
he
accepted
a
glass
of
sherry
from
the
tray
which
rawson
had
just
brought
out
so
i
am
afraid
shall
i
sir
bertram
admitted
it
is
one
of
the
signs
of
approaching
age
when
one
begins
to
rely
upon
other
people
i
remember
the
time
when
i
used
to
find
it
devilish
uncomfortable
to
have
a
son
well
i
would
rather
there
were
something
he
could
do
in
england
shall
we
go
in
major
no
use
waiting
for
gregory
he
just
as
likely
as
not
to
lunch
in
norwich
luncheon
was
at
times
a
difficult
function
holmes
was
in
a
sense
an
unwilling
guest
and
sir
bertram
was
unusually
silent
it
was
henry
with
his
stilted
phrases
and
sense
of
the
obligations
of
a
host
who
kept
conversation
going
towards
the
end
of
the
meal
gregory
put
in
an
unexpected
appearance
he
shook
hands
with
holmes
of
whose
presence
he
had
obviously
been
informed
and
apologised
to
his
father
so
sorry
dad
he
explained
it
took
me
some
time
to
find
just
the
trunk
i
wanted
and
then
i
remembered
that
i
had
ordered
some
riding
kit
at
houghton
and
i
thought
i
might
as
well
be
tried
on
any
news
about
the
burglary
major
nothing
of
any
moment
at
present
the
latter
replied
gregory
busied
himself
for
some
time
with
his
lunch
whilst
the
others
loitered
afterwards
they
strolled
out
on
to
the
lawn
together
for
coffee
as
soon
as
it
was
served
holmes
set
down
his
cup
and
faced
the
situation
gregory
he
said
i
know
you
will
remember
that
as
well
as
being
your
friend
and
i
hope
the
friend
of
every
one
here
i
am
a
government
official
gregory
paused
in
the
act
of
lighting
a
cigarette
and
stared
at
him
why
that
all
right
he
assented
what
about
it
the
police
have
evidence
major
holmes
continued
that
at
about
three
this
morning
that
is
to
say
twenty
minutes
or
so
before
the
burglary
at
the
great
house
was
committed
some
one
was
seen
to
leave
the
hall
cross
the
park
and
enter
the
great
house
or
at
any
rate
to
disappear
in
that
neighbourhood
gregory
finished
lighting
his
cigarette
where
on
earth
did
the
police
get
hold
of
their
information
he
enquired
from
a
poacher
from
a
person
whose
word
it
would
be
a
little
difficult
to
upset
the
chief
constable
replied
acting
on
his
information
i
have
come
up
here
to
pay
an
official
visit
i
have
interviewed
all
the
servants
without
result
i
understand
that
you
possess
a
key
to
the
smaller
library
door
which
you
sometimes
use
i
often
use
it
gregory
admitted
if
i
dine
out
or
anything
of
that
sort
or
come
home
by
the
mail
from
london
i
use
it
to
avoid
undoing
all
the
bolts
of
the
front
door
where
was
the
key
last
night
anywhere
where
any
one
could
have
got
hold
of
it
i
should
have
thought
so
it
in
my
dressing
room
somewhere
you
did
lend
it
to
any
one
certainly
not
no
one
has
ever
asked
me
for
it
you
did
use
it
yourself
last
night
no
i
have
used
it
for
weeks
major
holmes
nodded
well
he
said
that
that
i
now
appeal
to
you
all
can
you
help
me
a
reliable
witness
states
that
some
one
left
the
hall
through
that
library
door
last
night
was
seen
to
walk
across
the
park
and
to
all
reasonable
supposition
was
the
person
who
assaulted
and
chloroformed
johnson
and
committed
the
burglary
you
will
realise
that
this
is
a
serious
statement
can
any
of
you
suggest
anything
which
might
throw
light
upon
the
affair
all
that
i
can
suggest
gregory
remarked
is
that
your
informant
must
have
been
seeing
spooks
who
is
he
one
of
the
villagers
there
need
no
longer
be
any
secret
about
his
identity
major
holmes
decided
our
informant
is
a
private
detective
employed
by
mr
johnson
there
was
an
intense
and
ominous
silence
henry
ballaston
drew
his
chair
a
little
farther
back
into
the
shade
as
though
he
suddenly
felt
the
sun
too
strong
sir
bertram
whistled
softly
but
for
once
in
his
life
seemed
guilty
of
an
almost
unnatural
action
gregory
stood
as
though
turned
to
stone
across
his
face
for
a
moment
there
flitted
an
expression
of
dismay
the
chief
constable
saw
it
and
his
heart
sank
it
was
sir
bertram
brain
which
moved
the
quickest
how
the
mischief
did
this
johnson
get
hold
of
a
private
detective
at
a
moment
notice
he
enquired
he
has
had
him
in
the
neighbourhood
for
some
time
major
holmes
replied
his
presence
in
the
park
last
night
was
not
accidental
he
was
employed
by
johnson
in
connection
with
certain
theories
which
he
johnson
held
as
to
the
murder
of
mr
endacott
this
is
all
most
amazing
sir
bertram
observed
a
very
curious
action
on
the
part
of
a
man
who
is
a
total
stranger
to
the
neighbourhood
henry
put
in
the
chief
constable
brooded
for
several
moments
his
official
duty
was
hard
to
follow
the
whole
circumstances
were
unusual
he
faced
the
situation
from
the
point
of
view
johnson
may
be
a
stranger
to
the
neighbourhood
he
admitted
but
i
do
not
think
that
his
appearance
here
is
so
entirely
casual
as
he
tried
to
make
out
it
transpires
that
he
was
a
partner
of
endacott
in
the
great
firm
of
johnson
and
company
i
believe
that
the
real
object
of
his
coming
here
was
to
solve
the
mystery
of
endacott
murder
wu
ling
my
god
gregory
exclaimed
in
genuine
excitement
the
moment
i
saw
him
i
thought
i
recognised
him
then
it
seemed
incredible
why
of
course
i
was
a
fool
ever
to
doubt
it
he
went
on
he
played
the
chinaman
out
there
to
do
his
trading
up
in
the
villages
he
had
lived
there
most
of
his
life
it
was
easy
enough
then
when
he
finished
with
the
business
and
came
back
here
he
europeanised
himself
my
god
what
a
fool
i
have
been
i
do
know
anything
about
that
major
holmes
observed
he
came
to
me
in
norwich
a
short
time
ago
and
he
placed
before
me
some
very
serious
information
i
am
using
my
own
discretion
in
what
i
am
about
to
say
by
now
you
must
know
just
what
i
am
up
against
again
i
appeal
to
you
for
your
help
in
the
background
henry
shook
his
head
gravely
sir
bertram
with
the
slightest
possible
shrug
of
the
shoulders
turned
away
and
lit
a
cigarette
gregory
completely
at
his
ease
again
lolled
a
little
deeper
in
his
wicker
chair
my
dear
fellow
he
expostulated
how
the
deuce
can
any
of
us
help
you
i
tell
you
frankly
if
any
one
left
the
house
last
night
and
i
do
believe
they
did
i
for
one
do
know
anything
about
it
as
to
the
murder
well
if
johnson
private
agent
can
find
out
anything
about
that
the
whole
neighbourhood
will
be
indebted
to
him
how
on
earth
is
he
likely
to
succeed
however
when
you
and
scotland
yard
have
failed
the
murder
so
far
as
our
investigations
took
us
major
holmes
said
patiently
was
entirely
lacking
in
direct
motive
the
burglary
on
the
contrary
does
seem
to
have
had
an
extraordinary
but
clear
object
the
burglar
got
away
with
a
number
of
chinese
manuscripts
amongst
these
manuscripts
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
say
gregory
interrupted
smiling
as
though
in
amusement
but
you
wrong
all
the
same
old
endacott
had
been
through
them
there
was
one
which
could
help
the
owner
of
the
images
to
discover
the
treasure
where
are
these
infernal
images
major
holmes
asked
they
have
been
moved
upstairs
into
my
apartments
henry
ballaston
intervened
if
it
would
afford
you
any
satisfaction
to
inspect
them
i
will
take
you
there
with
pleasure
i
should
like
to
see
them
major
holmes
decided
they
all
returned
to
the
house
gregory
quitting
his
chair
with
an
air
of
reluctance
the
two
images
stood
in
a
small
sitting
room
opening
out
from
henry
ballaston
bedroom
at
the
top
of
the
house
an
apartment
of
extraordinary
almost
monastic
simplicity
they
stood
side
by
side
on
an
old
black
oak
bureau
and
against
the
white
of
the
walls
they
showed
up
with
almost
glaring
effect
the
body
and
the
soul
gregory
pointed
out
i
do
think
they
have
ever
been
worth
what
poor
old
bill
hammonde
and
i
went
through
for
them
they
got
bill
too
good
chap
he
was
the
legend
is
sir
bertram
explained
politely
that
those
heads
are
filled
with
jewels
yet
we
have
never
been
able
to
discover
an
opening
or
aperture
of
any
sort
if
there
is
any
truth
in
the
story
major
holmes
suggested
why
you
break
them
up
sir
bertram
shivered
that
at
least
he
said
one
would
keep
for
a
last
effort
those
images
holmes
are
nearly
a
thousand
years
old
and
if
you
are
any
judge
of
such
things
you
will
see
at
once
that
they
were
carved
by
a
great
artist
with
their
history
i
should
imagine
that
their
value
at
christie
would
be
at
least
several
thousand
pounds
each
so
long
as
they
are
intact
major
holmes
took
one
into
his
hands
and
set
it
down
again
amazed
at
the
weight
why
they
almost
as
heavy
as
bronze
he
exclaimed
the
wood
of
which
they
are
fashioned
is
a
species
of
teak
wood
almost
extinct
now
sir
bertram
explained
their
weight
of
course
is
rather
an
argument
against
their
being
hollow
on
the
other
hand
they
might
be
hollow
and
filled
with
jewels
there
is
a
further
legend
gregory
confided
that
there
is
inside
some
sort
of
infernal
machine
invented
during
the
last
century
by
the
priests
which
would
go
off
at
any
rough
usage
that
i
must
say
seems
to
me
a
bit
thick
at
the
same
time
the
chinese
were
always
rather
great
at
explosives
i
imagine
major
holmes
said
that
you
will
not
let
this
superstition
stand
in
your
way
provided
you
are
unable
to
discover
the
secret
opening
as
a
last
resort
sir
bertram
declared
we
have
decided
to
destroy
the
less
pleasing
of
the
images
and
i
gregory
announced
in
a
low
tone
his
eyes
fixed
upon
the
leering
image
of
the
body
mean
to
be
the
one
to
strike
the
blow
one
gets
kind
of
superstitious
over
there
you
know
holmes
he
went
on
i
lost
possession
of
the
other
image
for
a
time
the
robbers
got
off
with
it
when
they
raided
the
train
and
killed
poor
old
hammonde
but
that
devil
i
brought
home
with
me
all
i
can
say
is
that
i
do
want
to
be
left
alone
with
him
again
for
a
month
or
six
weeks
you
would
have
much
chance
would
you
at
the
norwich
assizes
if
you
pleaded
that
you
had
been
driven
to
commit
a
murder
through
the
influence
of
an
image
a
chinese
judge
would
have
understood
it
all
i
know
is
that
on
that
boat
i
was
never
myself
and
here
holmes
asked
curiously
i
kept
out
of
the
way
of
the
thing
when
it
was
once
here
gregory
replied
uncle
henry
took
care
of
it
then
and
i
think
it
would
take
more
than
the
power
of
an
image
to
move
him
from
the
paths
of
rectitude
then
through
old
endacott
we
got
hold
of
the
other
one
so
now
i
do
mind
it
is
only
when
he
out
of
reach
of
the
soul
that
that
chap
supposed
to
do
any
harm
you
were
lucky
to
regain
possession
of
the
other
image
the
chief
constable
observed
after
a
moment
pause
through
endacott
i
think
you
said
in
a
sort
of
way
gregory
answered
coldly
you
could
be
a
little
more
explicit
the
other
persisted
the
silence
which
followed
was
portentous
charged
with
electricity
it
was
sir
bertram
who
laid
his
hand
gently
upon
his
son
shoulder
gregory
is
rather
sensitive
about
this
business
he
said
considering
all
that
he
went
through
i
do
not
wonder
at
it
if
ever
it
becomes
expedient
for
us
to
explain
exactly
how
the
second
image
came
into
our
possession
we
will
do
so
that
moment
scarcely
seems
to
have
yet
arrived
major
holmes
abandoned
the
subject
a
little
abruptly
he
walked
along
the
great
corridor
with
its
rows
of
pictures
upon
one
side
and
mullioned
windows
on
the
other
speechless
and
absorbed
the
whole
place
seemed
flooded
with
afternoon
sunshine
which
found
its
way
into
the
gloomiest
corners
touching
some
old
suits
of
armour
with
a
gleam
of
fire
tracing
zigzag
hieroglyphics
upon
the
smooth
white
stone
floor
he
had
made
up
his
mind
what
course
of
action
to
adopt
and
it
had
not
been
an
easy
task
he
sent
for
inspector
cloutson
and
stood
making
his
adieux
to
his
hosts
at
the
last
minute
he
drew
gregory
on
one
side
i
hear
you
are
starting
off
on
another
of
your
long
rambles
gregory
he
said
something
a
little
more
permanent
this
time
i
am
going
to
try
the
far
west
first
lose
myself
for
a
year
or
two
nothing
definite
seems
to
be
known
just
yet
but
there
are
rumours
that
there
have
been
some
big
finds
of
gold
right
up
the
yukon
if
i
do
have
any
luck
i
shall
come
back
and
try
ranching
i
got
a
job
out
there
it
true
then
what
they
are
saying
the
major
continued
diffidently
things
here
are
pretty
bad
rotten
gregory
admitted
unless
a
miracle
happens
such
as
those
jewels
materialising
or
something
of
that
sort
ballaston
must
go
before
the
autumn
it
is
bad
news
the
other
sighed
it
is
almost
a
tragedy
enough
to
drive
any
one
crazy
he
added
his
rather
kindly
eyes
resting
for
a
moment
upon
gregory
face
i
am
going
to
give
you
a
word
of
advice
if
i
may
we
were
at
school
together
and
i
practically
owe
my
position
here
to
your
father
i
shall
have
to
settle
with
my
conscience
for
saying
it
i
may
decide
to
chuck
up
my
job
but
i
going
to
say
it
if
you
got
your
kit
ready
move
off
i
do
like
the
look
of
things
down
here
for
you
that
all
for
a
moment
gregory
was
speechless
not
exactly
from
surprise
but
from
some
mixture
of
emotions
which
found
outlet
in
speech
difficult
then
he
suddenly
took
the
hand
which
holmes
had
extended
and
wrung
it
you
a
good
fellow
holmes
he
said
i
do
like
the
look
of
things
myself
and
that
a
fact
i
may
pop
off
if
i
see
my
way
clear
if
i
do
well
you
wo
have
any
disagreeable
duties
to
perform
at
the
castle
i
promise
you
that
the
inspector
put
in
his
appearance
and
the
two
men
took
their
leave
gregory
remained
for
a
few
minutes
motionless
upon
the
broad
semicircle
of
white
stone
stretching
out
from
the
front
door
gazing
after
the
receding
car
presently
his
father
moved
up
to
his
side
holmes
seems
to
have
a
bee
in
his
bonnet
gregory
he
ventured
tentatively
gregory
nodded
he
a
good
fellow
he
declared
it
cost
him
something
to
do
it
i
know
but
he
given
me
the
office
advised
me
to
clear
out
within
the
next
hours
it
that
fellow
johnson
well
if
you
have
made
up
your
mind
to
go
sir
bertram
said
why
not
they
ca
do
anything
in
a
desperate
hurry
and
you
get
a
run
for
your
money
at
least
out
there
gregory
seemed
for
a
moment
puzzled
then
distressed
he
turned
and
looked
at
his
father
sir
bertram
expression
however
was
inscrutable
finally
he
swung
on
his
heel
at
any
rate
he
decided
i
finish
my
packing
chapter
xii
things
do
be
happening
round
about
here
for
sure
pank
remarked
as
he
moved
down
the
whisky
bottle
from
its
shelf
what
it
all
may
lead
to
is
more
than
a
body
can
say
but
i
do
like
the
look
of
it
mr
craske
the
grocer
added
less
than
his
usual
modicum
of
water
to
his
whisky
his
aspect
was
gloomy
so
also
were
the
aspects
of
franks
the
butcher
who
had
strolled
across
for
news
and
walter
beavens
the
wheelwright
who
had
come
on
a
similar
errand
it
almost
as
bad
craske
declared
as
the
week
after
the
murder
every
one
went
about
then
as
it
were
on
tiptoe
now
this
burglary
taken
by
itself
ai
anything
to
make
special
mention
of
why
johnson
himself
he
was
in
the
morning
after
it
happened
and
he
treated
it
mostly
as
a
joke
it
my
belief
pank
pronounced
that
there
something
more
serious
brewing
there
inspector
cloutson
come
to
stop
in
the
village
there
major
holmes
the
chief
constable
up
and
down
from
the
hall
all
day
there
johnson
he
do
come
near
any
more
mr
fielding
him
we
took
for
a
schoolmaster
and
whom
they
do
say
was
a
kind
of
detective
he
ai
been
in
and
rawson
why
no
one
ai
seen
him
for
four
days
we
shall
have
news
before
long
and
bad
news
i
afraid
it
may
be
there
wild
talk
going
about
craske
sighed
and
what
it
may
mean
no
one
can
say
for
sure
but
what
i
do
say
is
reason
is
reason
and
is
it
likely
that
any
one
here
could
have
a
grudge
against
a
poor
old
harmless
fellow
like
endacott
all
this
talk
of
images
and
chinese
documents
and
suchlike
seems
as
though
it
had
come
out
of
the
pages
of
one
of
these
serial
novels
as
folks
read
in
the
newspapers
i
do
take
no
stock
of
such
stuff
franks
pushed
his
tankard
across
to
be
refilled
there
one
bit
of
bad
news
at
any
rate
may
be
sprung
upon
us
at
any
moment
he
said
they
do
say
that
every
servant
in
the
hall
had
a
month
notice
yesterday
i
heard
that
from
miss
shane
the
housekeeper
niece
the
landlord
shook
his
head
gloomily
things
do
seem
to
be
pointing
that
way
he
admitted
and
rawson
keeping
away
and
all
if
so
be
that
it
true
it
will
be
a
sad
loss
the
squire
be
a
proud
man
in
his
way
but
he
be
a
true
gentleman
and
so
be
henry
and
a
more
popular
young
gent
than
gregory
has
never
been
known
in
the
county
it
a
wonderful
property
to
have
to
give
up
we
get
some
one
here
i
suppose
craske
predicted
pessimistically
who
made
pots
of
money
by
being
careful
and
goes
on
saving
pots
the
same
way
some
of
those
big
houses
the
way
they
do
go
through
their
books
and
talk
about
the
stores
to
you
why
here
mr
rawson
the
butler
entered
solemn
ponderous
and
dignified
as
ever
he
raised
his
black
bowler
hat
in
acknowledgment
of
the
greetings
which
assailed
him
from
all
sides
and
sank
slowly
into
a
chair
good
afternoon
gentlemen
he
said
pank
i
take
double
my
usual
quantity
of
scotch
whisky
with
me
rawson
the
grocer
insisted
we
missed
you
the
last
few
days
rawson
sighed
i
felt
too
worried
in
my
mind
for
company
he
confessed
it
no
secret
to
you
all
so
why
should
i
act
mysterious
about
it
skeery
doings
at
the
hall
there
was
a
little
rustle
of
interest
rawson
disposed
for
gossip
waited
until
his
drink
was
placed
in
his
hand
and
solemnly
pledged
its
donor
to
begin
with
he
confided
it
no
secret
now
that
we
in
trouble
we
may
have
acted
foolish
he
went
on
nothing
of
course
can
be
said
for
seventy
thousand
pounds
lost
at
newmarket
and
a
trifle
more
than
that
last
year
foolish
we
may
have
been
but
the
gentry
have
always
had
their
weaknesses
the
hounds
have
cost
us
a
cool
eight
thousand
a
year
for
the
last
five
years
and
subscriptions
getting
less
all
the
time
then
the
taxes
it
seems
whatever
sort
of
government
we
get
these
days
they
want
your
money
fingers
all
itching
for
it
get
you
all
ways
income
tax
and
land
tax
why
it
a
wonder
they
do
grab
the
breath
out
of
your
body
it
the
first
time
such
a
thing
happened
to
me
in
my
career
but
last
night
you
believe
me
gentlemen
i
had
my
notice
there
was
a
murmur
of
sympathy
rawson
raised
his
glass
and
drank
it
was
henry
as
usual
who
had
to
tackle
the
job
he
continued
he
sent
for
us
one
by
one
to
his
study
where
he
sat
as
prim
and
formal
as
ever
with
all
his
catalogues
around
and
his
books
of
reference
he
said
have
been
an
excellent
servant
but
conditions
render
it
necessary
for
my
brother
and
me
to
close
this
house
for
the
present
we
are
in
fact
ceasing
to
keep
an
establishment
i
am
compelled
therefore
to
ask
you
to
accept
a
month
notice
all
very
proper
and
regular
gentlemen
but
i
could
see
that
henry
were
feeling
it
shane
came
out
all
crying
i
seen
him
afterwards
though
and
he
were
just
the
same
as
usual
except
that
his
face
were
as
white
as
parchment
it
do
be
a
sad
loss
for
all
pank
declared
there
no
word
of
anything
but
good
in
these
parts
for
any
of
them
for
the
squire
or
henry
or
gregory
either
as
though
this
were
trouble
enough
rawson
proceeded
portentously
there
all
sorts
of
mysterious
doings
and
rumours
afloat
about
enough
to
drive
a
body
crazy
you
mind
the
young
man
fielding
who
called
himself
a
retired
schoolmaster
and
sat
in
the
corner
pretending
to
make
flies
the
hypocrite
craske
exclaimed
a
detective
that
what
he
was
rawson
went
on
not
a
police
detective
you
understand
but
one
of
them
that
goes
about
spying
for
a
living
now
he
is
up
and
swore
that
the
night
of
the
burglary
he
seen
some
one
leave
the
hall
by
the
oak
library
which
is
private
way
almost
twenty
minutes
or
half
an
hour
before
the
burglary
were
committed
there
was
a
little
buzz
of
exclamations
and
remarks
a
general
feeling
of
indignation
against
the
if
he
were
one
of
these
paid
spies
craske
enquired
who
were
paying
him
that
i
ca
say
for
sure
the
butler
acknowledged
but
i
have
my
suspicions
very
grave
suspicions
too
and
whom
might
you
be
fancying
to
be
the
man
mr
rawson
one
of
the
little
group
asked
him
as
has
taken
the
great
house
johnson
by
name
was
the
injured
reply
we
had
him
up
to
lunch
too
and
treated
him
as
it
were
beyond
his
station
i
glad
to
find
he
not
here
gentlemen
there
a
word
or
two
i
might
have
had
to
say
to
him
it
do
seem
most
mysterious
the
innkeeper
declared
what
do
you
suppose
this
johnson
has
got
to
do
with
it
all
rawson
that
he
putting
his
oar
in
johnson
the
butler
announced
has
come
to
these
parts
under
false
pretences
there
many
has
wondered
why
he
settled
here
and
many
asked
him
the
question
and
all
the
time
he
answered
innocent
like
that
he
just
wanted
the
country
and
the
house
suited
him
and
so
on
do
you
mind
all
on
you
when
he
pretended
to
be
surprised
about
the
murder
he
knew
about
it
all
the
time
he
was
endacott
partner
out
somewhere
in
foreign
parts
and
he
settled
down
here
in
a
mischievous
kind
of
way
to
make
trouble
and
disturbance
amongst
his
betters
well
i
never
pank
exclaimed
a
body
never
came
in
the
place
or
a
more
harmless
looking
there
nothing
fresh
is
there
rawson
about
the
murder
god
knows
was
the
butler
ponderous
pronouncement
there
strange
things
all
around
us
and
what
they
may
mean
or
where
they
may
lead
to
we
none
of
us
can
tell
at
this
present
moment
there
is
johnson
the
grocer
exclaimed
looking
out
over
the
muslin
blinds
and
inspector
cloutson
with
him
look
at
walking
together
so
confidential
like
i
like
to
know
what
they
saying
craske
confessed
heads
almost
touching
as
you
might
say
and
did
you
see
the
inspector
turn
around
and
look
across
towards
the
hall
the
two
men
halted
outside
the
postern
gate
presently
they
separated
and
with
a
brief
nod
johnson
entered
his
own
domain
whilst
inspector
cloutson
turned
and
made
his
way
back
towards
the
police
station
the
little
company
watched
johnson
retiring
figure
as
they
had
once
watched
his
progress
down
the
village
street
on
the
day
of
his
first
visit
in
my
opinion
rawson
declared
emphatically
that
the
man
brought
most
of
the
mischief
into
this
neighbourhood
i
not
one
to
wish
any
of
my
neighbours
harm
but
if
the
chap
who
broke
into
the
great
house
the
other
night
had
been
of
my
way
of
thinking
he
have
given
him
one
which
would
have
kept
him
quiet
for
a
bit
longer
than
this
johnson
moved
rather
wearily
to
his
favourite
seat
under
the
cedar
tree
and
sat
there
for
several
minutes
in
tired
contemplation
he
awoke
from
a
fit
of
brooding
to
find
katherine
besant
crossing
the
lawn
towards
him
she
was
bareheaded
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
had
been
running
he
rose
to
his
come
and
sit
down
he
begged
i
ca
stop
she
answered
i
just
came
in
i
wanted
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
he
took
her
hands
in
his
and
looked
at
her
steadily
she
was
a
little
flushed
with
her
hurrying
but
it
struck
him
that
her
hair
was
more
carefully
arranged
and
that
her
linen
frock
simple
though
its
fashion
was
becoming
the
slight
eagerness
in
her
manner
communicated
also
to
her
expression
gave
her
an
air
of
greater
life
and
vivacity
johnson
she
exclaimed
i
really
ca
stop
i
do
know
when
madame
may
want
me
but
what
does
it
all
mean
every
one
seems
wildly
unhappy
and
it
all
seems
to
centre
round
you
what
are
you
doing
to
everybody
you
were
so
kind
to
me
my
dear
he
replied
gently
it
would
take
a
long
time
to
explain
very
soon
you
will
know
everything
but
the
everything
that
i
am
to
know
seems
as
though
it
were
going
to
be
horrible
she
cried
madame
looks
as
if
she
were
about
to
die
every
moment
sir
bertram
rode
away
from
seeing
her
this
morning
looking
like
a
ghost
they
say
that
gregory
left
last
night
for
abroad
miss
endacott
sent
three
notes
to
him
yesterday
i
know
that
she
wanted
him
to
come
to
see
her
he
would
and
the
place
seems
full
full
of
phosphorescence
it
like
a
pause
before
a
thunder
storm
no
one
seems
to
know
quite
what
to
expect
is
it
you
who
have
been
stirring
up
all
this
trouble
he
shook
his
head
the
trouble
such
as
it
is
he
assured
her
solemnly
was
caused
by
those
who
must
suffer
for
it
who
are
they
she
demanded
he
pointed
over
his
shoulder
towards
the
hall
the
ballastons
he
answered
but
what
have
they
done
he
shook
his
head
do
ask
me
too
much
he
begged
it
an
ugly
story
and
you
know
it
soon
enough
only
believe
me
it
is
i
who
am
bringing
it
all
about
but
you
could
stop
it
she
expostulated
nothing
in
the
world
could
stop
it
he
answered
i
do
look
like
a
superstitious
man
do
i
miss
besant
i
should
have
said
so
she
admitted
i
have
this
belief
though
he
went
on
which
you
may
call
superstitious
or
you
may
not
there
are
some
things
which
a
man
who
meddles
with
must
suffer
for
i
have
seen
it
in
my
younger
days
in
egypt
and
i
have
seen
it
also
in
china
i
have
seen
a
man
who
posed
as
a
great
savant
and
egyptologist
destroy
a
sacred
tomb
the
newspapers
of
the
world
were
filled
with
accounts
of
the
treasure
he
discovered
he
died
within
a
few
months
and
to
this
day
no
one
knows
how
and
then
tell
me
this
by
what
right
does
a
young
man
like
gregory
ballaston
simply
because
he
has
courage
and
enterprise
and
because
he
is
faced
with
ruin
dare
to
come
out
to
a
strange
country
break
into
a
sacred
temple
and
rob
it
well
he
found
no
treasure
but
for
the
evil
which
has
come
because
of
his
you
must
not
blame
me
who
point
the
finger
to
his
guilt
you
must
blame
something
which
neither
you
nor
i
fully
understand
but
which
is
working
for
a
punishment
just
as
surely
but
you
do
think
she
faltered
you
ca
believe
that
gregory
ballaston
killed
mr
endacott
the
law
will
have
to
decide
that
he
answered
gravely
she
sat
for
several
moments
pensive
and
still
then
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
think
it
is
all
very
horrible
she
sighed
life
has
its
grim
and
terrible
side
he
declared
but
underlying
it
all
there
is
a
sense
of
justice
which
has
made
us
humans
frame
laws
and
institute
a
code
of
punishment
the
instinct
to
do
this
and
abide
by
the
results
is
a
part
of
nature
itself
no
one
really
escapes
the
consequences
of
will
you
promise
me
one
thing
miss
besant
she
had
been
in
the
act
of
turning
away
she
paused
everything
may
be
changed
here
in
a
few
days
he
went
on
and
of
course
i
may
be
pretty
unpopular
will
you
promise
me
that
you
will
not
go
away
without
seeing
me
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
she
gave
him
her
hand
quickly
to
his
surprise
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
i
promise
she
said
you
have
been
kind
to
me
at
any
rate
you
are
the
first
person
who
has
been
really
kind
to
me
for
years
she
moved
away
too
quickly
for
him
to
detain
her
johnson
returned
slowly
to
the
house
over
which
the
shadow
of
tragedy
seemed
once
more
to
be
brooding
chapter
xiii
doing
me
well
for
our
farewell
dinner
dad
gregory
murmured
appreciatively
as
he
set
down
his
glass
with
a
little
gesture
of
reverence
port
sir
bertram
smiled
pleasantly
it
was
not
for
the
two
footmen
standing
motionless
at
either
end
of
the
magnificent
sideboard
or
even
for
rawson
behind
his
master
chair
to
know
that
this
was
anything
but
an
ordinary
function
conversation
throughout
the
meal
had
taken
no
account
of
possible
catastrophe
they
had
talked
of
the
sporting
side
of
gregory
expedition
sir
bertram
himself
had
shot
big
game
in
canada
more
than
once
there
are
only
a
few
bottles
left
i
regret
to
say
sir
bertram
remarked
we
started
on
the
last
bin
at
the
commencement
of
the
year
this
is
the
cockburn
shipping
henry
put
in
we
have
always
considered
it
the
finer
wine
if
you
will
pass
the
decanter
bertram
i
will
indulge
in
my
second
glass
before
the
decanter
was
finished
rawson
and
his
satellites
had
departed
sir
bertram
glanced
at
his
watch
you
have
nearly
an
hour
he
said
what
time
did
you
tell
holmes
you
would
leave
at
ten
gregory
replied
the
train
leaves
norwich
at
sir
bertram
rose
from
his
place
they
strolled
into
the
library
drank
coffee
and
liqueurs
and
lit
cigarettes
there
was
still
nothing
in
their
conversation
to
indicate
the
great
crisis
henry
was
the
first
to
introduce
a
note
of
unexpectedness
if
i
may
claim
ten
minutes
of
your
time
gregory
he
said
it
would
gratify
me
if
you
would
pay
a
visit
to
my
room
you
too
i
trust
bertram
he
added
why
of
course
uncle
gregory
acquiesced
i
just
fill
my
case
with
these
cigarettes
if
you
do
mind
dad
may
save
me
opening
my
travelling
bag
by
all
means
his
father
begged
they
ascended
the
great
staircase
gregory
pausing
every
now
and
then
to
look
at
one
of
his
favourite
pictures
henry
led
the
way
to
his
own
room
with
its
quaint
air
of
monasticity
and
severity
accentuated
by
the
windows
he
closed
the
door
carefully
behind
him
i
should
like
before
you
depart
gregory
he
began
to
assure
you
that
my
sympathies
have
been
entirely
with
you
in
your
gallant
but
attempt
to
restore
the
fortunes
of
our
family
i
may
or
may
not
agree
with
you
in
your
decision
that
these
he
waved
his
hand
towards
the
two
images
should
remain
unbroken
there
are
times
he
went
on
when
i
fancy
that
our
friend
there
with
the
very
evil
and
mocking
leer
is
trying
to
boast
of
the
treasures
he
possesses
and
with
which
he
refuses
to
part
that
however
is
an
effort
of
the
imagination
in
which
i
seldom
indulge
it
occurred
to
me
further
that
i
should
like
before
you
leave
to
prove
to
you
that
my
sympathy
with
your
enterprise
was
not
confined
to
a
merely
passive
attitude
my
actions
may
not
have
been
entirely
judicious
but
they
were
it
was
i
who
on
a
certain
night
made
use
of
your
key
entered
the
great
house
in
i
must
confess
a
surreptitious
manner
relieved
myself
of
interference
on
the
part
of
johnson
i
am
afraid
in
somewhat
inconsiderate
fashion
and
purloined
the
manuscripts
which
i
had
hoped
might
help
us
towards
the
discovery
of
the
treasure
the
cigarette
which
sir
bertram
had
been
holding
between
his
fingers
slipped
on
to
the
carpet
and
lay
there
almost
unnoticed
he
gazed
at
his
brother
with
a
great
astonishment
in
his
face
gregory
taken
even
more
by
surprise
stared
at
him
speechless
and
neither
of
them
said
a
word
henry
stooped
down
picked
up
the
lighted
cigarette
and
threw
it
into
the
fireplace
henry
you
crazy
sir
bertram
exclaimed
at
last
uncle
henry
gregory
cried
something
which
was
finally
a
smile
parted
henry
lips
as
he
pointed
to
a
neat
package
upon
the
table
these
are
the
manuscripts
he
said
i
regret
to
say
that
my
expedition
was
a
failure
nothing
there
helps
us
in
any
degree
but
how
the
devil
do
you
know
gregory
demanded
whom
did
you
get
to
read
them
during
the
last
few
months
his
uncle
confided
with
a
view
to
making
this
enterprise
a
success
i
have
studied
and
read
chinese
god
bless
my
soul
sir
bertram
gasped
the
language
presented
its
difficulties
henry
admitted
during
my
last
visit
to
london
in
january
i
consulted
a
chinese
scholar
who
put
me
in
the
right
way
and
i
have
attained
to
a
certain
proficiency
enough
at
any
rate
for
the
purpose
it
struck
me
that
major
holmes
enquiries
into
the
matter
were
becoming
somewhat
unpleasant
and
i
thought
therefore
that
i
would
confide
the
truth
to
you
in
case
at
any
time
suspicion
should
fall
upon
another
person
this
parcel
containing
the
documents
contains
also
a
letter
from
me
acknowledging
my
exploit
and
a
letter
of
apology
to
miss
endacott
whose
property
i
suppose
they
must
be
considered
they
are
undamaged
and
except
for
the
slight
injury
to
johnson
which
i
regret
was
necessary
the
affair
seems
to
me
to
be
trivial
gregory
clasped
his
forehead
trivial
he
groaned
there
will
i
fear
be
a
certain
loss
of
dignity
should
i
be
called
upon
to
answer
for
my
misdoing
henry
concluded
but
i
can
assure
you
that
i
shall
take
no
steps
to
evade
any
action
which
may
ensue
that
i
think
is
all
it
only
remains
for
me
gregory
to
wish
you
success
abroad
of
our
own
future
here
we
will
not
speak
whilst
the
ballaston
treasures
and
heirlooms
remain
intact
my
place
is
with
them
a
pleasant
voyage
gregory
he
shook
hands
and
conducted
them
courteously
to
the
door
his
little
pat
on
his
nephew
shoulder
was
the
nearest
approach
to
affection
he
had
ever
shown
gregory
and
his
father
descended
the
stairs
almost
in
silence
when
they
reached
the
hall
gregory
sank
into
a
chair
and
held
his
head
in
his
hands
dad
was
that
a
dream
he
demanded
i
ca
conceive
it
uncle
henry
of
all
men
in
the
world
it
is
the
ballaston
spirit
concealed
sir
bertram
murmured
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
or
so
father
and
son
sat
in
the
great
hall
without
speech
there
was
a
curiously
intense
silence
broken
only
by
the
ticking
of
a
large
clock
and
through
the
window
the
twittering
of
a
nightingale
preparing
for
his
aftermath
of
song
sir
bertram
rose
at
last
to
his
feet
let
us
walk
on
the
terrace
gregory
he
suggested
the
car
will
be
round
in
a
few
minutes
they
strolled
out
together
sir
bertram
correct
and
debonair
from
the
polish
of
his
hair
to
the
pearl
studs
in
his
shirt
and
his
scrupulously
cut
dinner
clothes
gregory
in
travelling
tweeds
prepared
for
his
journey
sir
bertram
took
his
son
arm
as
they
commenced
their
leisurely
promenade
i
am
afraid
he
said
in
a
tone
of
very
rare
gravity
that
it
all
up
with
us
ballastons
gregory
you
young
and
fit
though
and
got
quite
enough
to
amuse
myself
with
it
will
have
to
be
france
i
suppose
or
spain
it
all
a
compromise
of
course
and
a
cursed
compromise
there
only
one
place
for
an
englishman
to
live
and
on
his
own
land
it
the
devil
own
luck
to
lose
ballaston
but
gone
the
limit
eh
gregory
to
try
to
keep
it
yes
gregory
admitted
we
made
a
bid
for
it
at
any
rate
even
uncle
henry
his
tone
had
grown
more
serious
the
shadow
of
something
unspoken
seemed
to
be
lying
between
them
personally
sir
bertram
continued
i
regret
nothing
i
blame
nobody
for
anything
i
consider
that
everything
was
justified
you
have
to
make
a
fresh
start
gregory
do
do
so
with
that
somewhat
bourgeois
impediment
a
slurred
conscience
what
has
been
done
has
been
done
and
is
finished
with
gregory
for
a
moment
did
not
reply
his
puzzled
eyes
sought
his
father
but
sought
them
in
vain
for
my
part
sir
bertram
repeated
steadily
i
regret
nothing
it
was
worth
the
effort
and
as
for
henry
god
bless
him
the
lights
of
the
car
flashed
from
the
stable
yard
and
so
my
dear
boy
his
father
concluded
in
his
ordinary
tone
you
swing
your
bundle
figuratively
speaking
at
the
end
of
your
stick
and
set
out
on
your
allegorical
journey
only
for
god
sake
do
come
back
lord
mayor
of
london
gregory
had
already
taken
his
seat
the
chauffeur
hand
was
upon
the
change
speeds
gear
when
rawson
hurried
forward
there
is
another
car
coming
up
the
avenue
sir
he
announced
would
it
be
as
well
to
wait
for
a
moment
gregory
looked
out
of
the
window
he
could
see
the
twin
lights
flashing
in
the
distance
gleaming
slantwise
through
the
trees
then
again
pools
of
light
in
the
for
only
a
moment
he
hesitated
but
during
that
moment
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
taking
leave
of
much
that
was
dear
in
life
then
he
stepped
out
of
the
car
and
stood
upon
the
edge
of
the
terrace
it
might
be
as
well
rawson
he
agreed
with
somewhat
elaborate
casualness
i
wonder
who
the
devil
it
can
be
at
this
time
of
the
night
sir
bertram
speculated
the
car
resolved
itself
into
shape
its
very
crudity
its
ugliness
seemed
symbolic
the
driver
was
in
plain
clothes
but
he
sat
stiffly
and
there
was
something
official
about
his
appearance
by
his
side
was
major
holmes
behind
sat
inspector
cloutson
the
two
latter
descended
as
the
car
drew
up
well
major
sir
bertram
exclaimed
what
new
thunderbolt
are
you
going
to
launch
the
chief
constable
rather
avoided
his
eyes
we
want
a
word
with
you
please
he
confided
laying
his
hand
lightly
upon
gregory
arm
they
all
entered
the
house
together
sir
bertram
led
the
way
to
the
library
thrust
open
the
door
and
closed
it
again
when
they
had
all
entered
now
what
the
devil
is
it
this
time
holmes
he
asked
a
little
testily
you
must
be
annoyed
with
me
if
i
say
that
i
am
getting
rather
tired
of
these
visitations
i
deeply
regret
the
necessity
for
the
present
one
was
the
grave
reply
gregory
ballaston
i
am
sorry
to
tell
you
that
inspector
cloutson
here
has
a
warrant
for
your
arrest
i
should
strongly
advise
you
to
make
no
reply
to
the
charge
and
to
come
with
us
to
norwich
what
is
the
charge
gregory
demanded
a
very
serious
one
i
am
afraid
major
holmes
announced
i
have
as
a
matter
of
fact
two
warrants
the
first
charging
you
gregory
ballaston
with
assault
on
one
peter
johnson
and
burglary
at
the
great
house
on
the
night
of
july
and
the
second
by
which
you
stand
charged
with
the
murder
of
ralph
endacott
at
the
great
house
on
june
of
last
year
there
is
nothing
to
be
gained
by
denial
or
comment
or
anything
else
at
the
present
moment
i
beg
you
gregory
not
to
attempt
any
reply
but
to
come
with
us
the
door
behind
had
been
opened
so
softly
that
no
one
heard
it
they
were
all
standing
motionless
when
henry
with
a
brown
paper
parcel
under
his
arm
entered
but
that
is
ridiculous
major
holmes
he
said
quietly
you
must
have
been
very
greatly
misled
it
was
i
who
was
guilty
of
the
burglary
here
in
this
parcel
you
will
find
all
the
documents
i
purloined
or
i
might
say
borrowed
the
instrument
with
which
i
cut
out
the
panel
of
the
door
another
with
which
i
picked
the
lock
instruments
i
may
say
obtained
with
the
greatest
possible
difficulty
from
an
establishment
in
london
there
was
a
moment
blank
silence
major
holmes
expression
after
the
first
shock
of
surprise
was
one
of
complete
incredulity
this
is
a
very
remarkable
statement
on
your
part
ballaston
he
observed
i
presume
you
wish
us
to
take
note
of
what
you
say
at
the
same
time
i
have
i
am
sorry
to
remind
you
a
warrant
against
your
nephew
on
a
more
serious
charge
henry
ballaston
apologised
with
dignity
i
regret
he
said
not
to
have
mentioned
the
two
affairs
together
i
also
on
june
of
last
year
after
a
few
words
of
unpleasant
discussion
with
endacott
shot
him
through
the
head
once
more
there
was
a
brief
spell
of
breathless
silence
henry
ballaston
was
entirely
master
of
the
situation
perfectly
slightly
apologetic
father
and
son
were
gazing
into
each
other
eyes
with
mutual
and
amazed
interrogation
you
see
henry
continued
in
explanatory
fashion
endacott
was
a
very
unreasonable
man
he
admitted
that
he
had
made
a
translation
of
the
manuscript
but
he
refused
to
give
it
to
me
he
desired
his
niece
to
profit
by
it
i
suppose
i
must
have
lost
my
temper
i
shot
him
and
secured
the
other
image
but
could
find
no
trace
of
the
manuscript
hence
my
second
effort
within
the
last
few
days
have
i
made
myself
quite
clear
sir
bertram
fingers
upon
his
son
arm
had
grown
like
the
grip
of
a
vice
he
leaned
forward
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
did
do
it
greg
he
whispered
hoarsely
before
god
i
did
was
the
passionate
reply
i
thought
it
was
you
chapter
xiv
johnson
that
same
evening
was
smoking
the
cigar
of
discontent
drinking
the
coffee
of
bitterness
and
sipping
the
brandy
of
fire
around
him
was
all
the
stillness
and
the
sweetness
of
the
summer
twilight
which
he
loved
so
much
stars
burning
in
a
violet
sky
the
breath
of
roses
in
the
air
the
peaceful
village
sounds
in
his
ears
more
lulling
and
soothing
than
absolute
silence
yet
he
was
filled
with
disquietude
he
rose
and
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
paced
the
long
strip
of
velvety
lawn
what
he
had
done
what
he
had
worked
for
seemed
to
him
to
be
a
simple
act
of
justice
yet
with
its
accomplishment
he
was
acutely
conscious
of
an
intense
isolation
no
one
was
in
sympathy
with
him
every
one
loved
the
wicked
ballastons
even
katherine
besant
had
left
him
her
eyes
streaming
with
tears
madame
had
sent
imploring
but
vain
messages
in
the
village
he
felt
that
it
was
barely
safe
to
show
himself
then
when
he
was
wondering
where
to
look
for
consolation
the
postern
gate
opened
quickly
two
women
entered
katherine
besant
and
claire
he
moved
forward
to
welcome
them
miss
endacott
katherine
explained
wants
to
see
you
immediately
and
talk
to
you
take
her
away
somewhere
i
will
wait
i
am
pleased
to
talk
to
miss
endacott
anywhere
she
wishes
johnson
acquiesced
in
the
study
quickly
claire
begged
she
swung
round
upon
him
as
soon
as
they
had
entered
the
room
superb
beautiful
but
furious
johnson
she
began
i
have
come
to
beseech
you
to
insist
that
you
move
no
further
in
this
horrible
affair
nothing
can
bring
my
uncle
back
to
life
nothing
can
ever
still
the
remorse
of
whoever
killed
him
beyond
that
let
it
rest
i
implore
you
johnson
to
do
nothing
more
my
dear
young
lady
he
replied
gravely
think
of
what
you
are
proposing
you
can
scarcely
be
content
to
let
your
uncle
murderer
go
scot
free
that
is
just
what
i
do
want
she
persisted
he
gained
nothing
by
it
and
i
am
quite
sure
that
whoever
it
was
he
was
not
altogether
sane
even
on
the
steamer
johnson
i
beg
you
to
believe
me
gregory
ballaston
was
under
the
influence
of
that
horrible
image
all
the
time
he
behaved
quite
strangely
as
soon
as
he
had
parted
from
it
he
was
as
different
as
possible
if
whoever
killed
my
uncle
came
from
the
house
where
that
image
is
it
a
terrible
thing
to
say
but
i
honestly
believe
it
they
could
help
it
they
were
responsible
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
shook
his
head
it
is
too
late
he
said
what
do
you
mean
too
late
she
demanded
with
a
sudden
fear
in
her
eyes
what
have
you
done
what
right
have
you
to
interfere
anyway
gregory
ballaston
is
going
abroad
that
is
the
best
thing
that
could
happen
it
is
nevertheless
too
late
johnson
declared
the
local
police
have
consulted
with
scotland
yard
by
telephone
and
they
have
decided
that
the
evidence
they
hold
at
present
against
gregory
ballaston
is
sufficient
for
them
to
stop
his
going
abroad
they
have
issued
two
warrants
he
will
be
arrested
i
should
say
within
the
next
few
minutes
she
seemed
suddenly
to
tower
above
him
white
passionate
menacing
her
eyes
blazed
her
fingers
seemed
to
seek
a
weapon
it
was
the
first
vital
fury
of
youth
you
brute
she
exclaimed
oh
gregory
for
a
moment
the
earth
seemed
to
darken
around
her
johnson
groaned
as
he
led
the
girl
to
a
couch
miss
endacott
he
said
this
is
a
terrible
business
but
believe
me
justice
must
be
done
murder
is
an
unforgivable
crime
to
take
another
man
life
have
you
thought
what
it
means
what
about
my
life
she
moaned
do
you
understand
i
was
content
never
to
see
him
again
i
lied
about
the
image
to
save
him
but
i
love
him
if
this
horrible
thing
happens
i
think
that
i
shall
kill
you
i
shall
either
do
that
or
die
myself
i
ca
bear
it
i
tell
you
i
bear
it
she
leaned
forward
in
her
chair
and
began
to
sob
johnson
mopped
his
forehead
feverishly
it
was
perhaps
in
his
eager
desire
to
escape
from
the
horror
of
the
moment
that
he
took
particular
note
of
the
long
key
which
was
attached
to
the
chain
which
hung
around
her
neck
and
which
had
temporarily
escaped
its
resting
place
what
key
is
that
he
asked
her
sharply
she
took
no
notice
at
first
he
repeated
his
question
she
looked
as
though
she
could
have
struck
him
key
she
echoed
scornfully
what
does
it
matter
why
do
you
ask
me
about
keys
at
a
moment
like
this
there
only
one
thing
that
matters
he
must
be
saved
you
must
do
something
take
back
something
you
have
said
of
course
i
know
he
did
it
or
i
should
be
with
him
at
this
moment
he
not
bad
he
must
be
killed
i
oh
my
god
she
began
to
sob
again
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
shoulder
listen
he
said
i
will
do
all
that
i
can
i
promise
you
but
you
must
tell
me
what
this
key
is
i
have
a
reason
for
asking
it
came
from
some
about
eleven
months
ago
she
answered
wearily
they
said
it
was
the
duplicate
which
my
uncle
had
ordered
the
last
time
he
was
in
london
he
removed
the
chain
from
her
neck
crossed
the
room
and
entered
the
little
annex
the
door
of
which
since
the
burglary
had
stood
open
and
where
in
a
corner
a
rusty
old
safe
had
been
fitted
into
the
wall
at
the
first
turn
the
key
slipped
in
and
the
lock
yielded
he
swung
the
door
open
in
the
darkness
there
was
the
gleam
of
a
bulky
white
envelope
he
took
it
out
it
was
addressed
to
claire
endacott
he
examined
it
for
a
moment
then
he
closed
the
safe
and
returned
to
the
library
miss
endacott
he
announced
that
key
of
yours
has
solved
something
which
has
puzzled
me
for
a
very
long
time
it
has
opened
the
old
safe
here
the
other
key
to
it
was
inside
this
letter
as
you
see
is
for
you
i
have
always
felt
convinced
that
your
uncle
before
his
death
had
succeeded
in
making
some
sort
of
a
translation
of
the
document
which
he
possessed
indicating
the
whereabouts
of
the
jewels
this
is
probably
the
solution
she
flung
the
letter
away
and
but
for
his
intervention
would
have
trampled
it
with
her
foot
upon
the
floor
do
something
she
begged
you
must
stop
what
is
going
to
happen
it
is
fair
it
is
right
he
rescued
the
letter
and
himself
broke
the
seal
she
snatched
it
from
his
fingers
do
waste
time
she
pleaded
do
something
letters
what
does
it
matter
about
letters
it
is
from
your
uncle
he
told
her
solemnly
probably
the
last
thing
he
ever
wrote
she
tore
open
the
envelope
with
quick
nervous
fingers
anxious
yet
reluctant
she
began
to
read
with
a
sort
of
sullen
indifference
then
she
seemed
suddenly
galvanised
into
a
new
and
amazingly
altered
state
of
living
johnson
as
he
watched
her
was
terrified
she
sprang
to
her
feet
and
shrieked
out
at
the
top
of
her
voice
read
it
read
it
yourself
she
cried
gripping
him
by
the
arm
so
that
her
fingers
bored
their
way
into
his
flesh
read
it
and
tell
me
that
it
is
the
truth
let
me
see
too
spell
it
out
read
it
their
heads
touched
her
breath
came
hot
upon
his
cheek
she
grasped
the
letter
as
though
afraid
it
might
be
torn
from
her
the
great
house
saturday
night
my
dear
claire
i
went
to
london
this
morning
with
the
shadow
of
a
fear
no
more
i
come
back
doomed
you
can
hear
all
about
it
if
you
like
from
sir
francis
moore
harley
street
three
months
to
live
and
much
suffering
i
think
not
i
shall
end
it
you
will
be
rich
much
richer
than
you
think
malcolm
have
my
will
you
and
your
aunt
will
share
alike
i
enclose
in
this
letter
a
translation
of
a
document
which
will
tell
you
unless
the
document
lies
how
to
obtain
the
treasure
in
the
images
use
it
as
you
will
i
have
no
interest
i
should
have
liked
a
year
or
two
here
but
i
prefer
what
is
to
come
to
an
increase
of
the
agony
of
which
i
have
already
had
a
foretaste
i
hope
that
you
will
be
happy
ralph
endacott
he
read
it
through
word
by
word
she
repeated
them
after
him
then
a
calm
seemed
to
come
upon
her
which
was
almost
unnatural
take
care
of
the
letter
he
enjoined
do
lose
it
he
rushed
out
across
the
lawn
and
through
the
postern
gate
down
the
great
avenue
from
the
house
he
could
see
the
lights
of
two
cars
flashing
he
ran
on
to
the
crossroads
and
stood
there
with
arms
extended
presently
they
swung
round
the
corner
and
at
the
sight
of
him
were
brought
to
a
standstill
with
a
grinding
of
the
brakes
in
the
front
one
were
major
holmes
sir
bertram
and
gregory
in
the
rear
one
cloutson
and
henry
ballaston
johnson
gripped
major
holmes
by
the
arm
major
he
exclaimed
an
amazing
thing
has
happened
you
must
come
round
to
the
great
house
at
once
major
holmes
frowned
i
am
afraid
johnson
he
said
it
is
too
late
for
any
sort
of
intervention
the
criminal
has
confessed
johnson
was
staggered
but
still
frantically
eloquent
there
can
be
nothing
to
confess
he
insisted
come
and
i
show
you
the
letter
i
show
you
where
i
found
it
you
must
come
you
in
charge
of
this
case
i
sane
it
was
i
who
wanted
justice
done
you
must
see
what
has
happened
see
the
open
safe
read
the
letter
major
holmes
descended
and
gave
an
order
to
the
sergeant
behind
both
cars
were
driven
to
the
great
house
almost
pushed
in
by
johnson
they
crowded
into
the
library
he
pointed
to
the
open
safe
visible
through
the
door
of
the
annex
miss
endacott
had
the
key
he
explained
i
noticed
it
round
her
neck
it
came
a
month
after
endacott
death
i
opened
the
safe
and
found
this
letter
that
you
must
all
read
i
will
swear
that
it
is
in
ralph
endacott
handwriting
his
niece
will
swear
it
i
took
it
from
the
safe
ralph
endacott
shot
himself
he
was
dying
he
shot
himself
gregory
gasped
there
is
a
doubt
about
it
johnson
declared
the
name
of
the
doctor
is
there
he
was
a
dying
man
across
the
room
their
eyes
met
gregory
and
claire
it
seemed
as
though
nothing
could
keep
them
apart
without
conscious
movement
he
was
by
her
side
her
hands
in
his
all
the
time
with
slow
deliberate
emphasis
major
holmes
was
reading
the
letter
aloud
reading
the
words
penned
by
a
dying
man
the
supreme
yet
ghastly
irony
of
which
no
one
properly
apprehended
in
those
few
minutes
of
immense
relief
why
did
you
tell
me
claire
faltered
as
soon
as
she
could
find
words
gregory
glanced
behind
at
the
little
group
and
drew
her
nearer
and
nearer
a
nightmare
was
passing
from
his
brain
i
thought
it
was
dad
he
whispered
under
his
breath
what
could
i
do
the
letter
appears
to
be
genuine
major
holmes
decided
looking
up
with
an
air
of
great
relief
and
the
name
of
the
doctor
fortunately
provides
us
with
corroborative
evidence
but
under
the
circumstances
i
must
confess
that
i
fail
to
understand
henry
ballaston
position
he
added
turning
towards
him
the
latter
coughed
a
little
nervously
it
has
never
been
my
custom
he
declared
to
countenance
any
deviation
from
the
truth
in
others
or
to
indulge
in
anything
approaching
a
falsehood
myself
i
have
to
admit
however
that
on
the
present
occasion
i
made
a
false
statement
which
i
beg
leave
to
withdraw
the
fact
is
he
confided
with
a
touch
of
that
ingenuousness
which
was
one
of
his
characteristics
i
never
doubted
for
a
moment
that
my
nephew
gregory
in
the
interests
of
the
family
was
guilty
of
this
misdemeanour
i
am
a
useless
person
in
this
world
he
is
a
young
man
and
our
direct
heir
i
did
what
i
thought
best
but
the
image
sir
bertram
demanded
in
bewilderment
the
second
image
of
the
soul
how
on
earth
did
that
get
to
the
hall
i
brought
it
was
henry
complacent
reply
but
when
gregory
asked
helplessly
on
the
night
of
endacott
unfortunate
decease
henry
replied
i
must
confess
that
on
the
previous
evening
i
paid
a
surreptitious
visit
here
i
had
no
idea
on
that
occasion
of
purloining
the
image
but
i
was
anxious
to
secure
if
possible
a
translation
of
any
of
the
chinese
documents
which
endacott
was
known
to
possess
which
might
assist
us
towards
the
recovery
of
the
jewels
i
found
endacott
however
at
work
and
i
was
unfortunate
enough
to
disturb
him
during
his
brief
absence
in
the
garden
i
endeavoured
to
peruse
his
papers
but
his
unexpectedly
prompt
return
forced
me
on
that
occasion
to
abandon
the
enterprise
on
the
following
evening
i
saw
gregory
leave
the
house
i
came
to
see
if
you
were
still
in
the
garden
gregory
interrupted
turning
to
claire
precisely
henry
acquiesced
but
i
was
not
at
that
time
aware
of
your
er
attachment
nor
did
i
attribute
any
sentimental
purpose
to
your
nocturnal
excursion
i
followed
you
and
at
the
side
gate
here
after
some
considerable
interval
i
heard
what
i
imagined
to
be
a
muffled
revolver
shot
i
crept
from
my
place
of
concealment
and
entered
the
library
endacott
was
lying
there
quite
dead
i
listened
for
a
moment
i
was
perhaps
unnerved
i
imagined
that
i
heard
your
retreating
footsteps
from
the
anteroom
into
the
courtyard
i
listened
again
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
the
image
was
lying
on
the
floor
by
endacott
side
he
had
probably
been
examining
it
prior
to
his
lamented
action
and
the
fall
of
his
body
had
displaced
it
i
considered
i
decided
that
your
nerve
gregory
had
failed
you
that
having
committed
the
preliminary
er
misdeed
you
had
hurried
away
without
the
image
i
accordingly
picked
it
up
and
brought
it
home
i
placed
it
by
the
side
of
the
other
in
my
room
it
has
been
there
ever
since
i
saw
the
shock
which
its
presence
caused
you
my
dear
brother
you
too
gregory
but
i
did
not
think
an
explanation
advisable
sir
bertram
laid
his
hand
upon
his
son
shoulder
my
god
gregory
he
muttered
i
thought
i
thought
of
course
that
it
was
you
gregory
groaned
and
i
he
explained
as
i
knew
it
was
i
thought
it
must
be
you
my
god
these
ballastons
major
holmes
exclaimed
with
amazed
fervour
a
wonderful
sir
bertram
had
slipped
away
and
was
on
his
knees
by
madame
couch
johnson
whilst
every
one
else
was
talking
confusedly
hastened
down
to
the
cellar
gregory
led
claire
out
into
the
garden
in
his
hand
was
the
paper
she
had
passed
over
to
him
the
images
he
whispered
let
go
and
find
them
they
drove
in
the
limousine
car
still
laden
with
his
luggage
through
the
scented
darkness
back
to
the
hall
his
arms
around
her
her
head
resting
contentedly
upon
his
shoulder
whilst
she
waited
he
ran
upstairs
to
the
amazement
of
rawson
and
the
footman
who
had
admitted
him
and
presently
returned
with
the
two
images
rawson
met
him
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
his
face
was
full
of
astonishment
and
piteous
appeal
you
will
excuse
me
gregory
sir
he
begged
if
there
any
news
gregory
staggered
past
him
borne
down
by
his
burden
everything
all
right
rawson
he
exclaimed
endacott
shot
himself
found
out
he
was
going
to
die
anyway
we
shall
be
back
all
three
of
us
to
sleep
i
may
not
be
going
abroad
at
all
get
yourself
a
bottle
of
wine
rawson
tell
you
more
about
it
when
we
get
back
another
drive
which
seemed
to
pass
like
a
dream
a
dream
during
which
the
agony
of
the
last
hour
appeared
to
fade
into
nothingness
then
the
great
house
again
the
images
upon
the
library
table
and
a
little
crowd
gathered
around
johnson
to
whom
gregory
had
passed
the
paper
called
out
the
instructions
you
press
the
right
eye
of
the
body
he
directed
and
press
at
the
same
time
the
inner
lobe
of
the
left
ear
then
you
move
the
image
forward
three
times
slowly
pressing
most
at
the
lowest
point
now
then
gregory
obeyed
the
instructions
at
the
end
of
the
third
movement
there
was
a
slight
noise
inside
like
the
whirring
of
a
spring
a
ticking
began
they
stood
a
little
distance
away
suddenly
the
right
eye
opened
and
a
stream
of
what
seemed
to
be
red
and
crystal
and
green
fire
came
out
and
discharged
itself
upon
the
tablecloth
every
one
drew
closer
fascinated
breathless
until
with
a
final
whirring
the
shower
ended
johnson
passed
his
hands
over
the
stones
the
finest
emeralds
i
ever
saw
he
declared
there
is
one
diamond
there
i
would
dare
to
now
for
the
soul
you
reverse
the
process
press
the
left
eye
and
the
lobe
of
the
right
ear
this
time
after
the
whirring
ended
the
left
eye
opened
and
a
slow
stream
of
pink
and
white
pearls
fell
on
to
the
table
the
tears
of
buddha
johnson
exclaimed
it
the
oldest
superstition
on
the
river
buddha
weeps
the
tears
are
pearls
again
they
watched
spellbound
this
stream
continued
even
longer
than
the
other
one
then
there
was
a
little
click
and
all
was
over
the
eye
slipped
back
the
image
seemed
to
smile
in
beneficent
fashion
fingers
tightened
upon
gregory
arm
without
expert
advice
johnson
pronounced
in
an
awed
tone
i
would
take
less
than
a
million
for
them
they
belong
to
you
every
stone
gregory
whispered
to
his
companion
she
laughed
up
at
him
does
it
matter
she
murmured
chapter
xv
once
more
five
men
from
a
safe
distance
behind
the
muslin
curtains
watched
the
approach
towards
the
village
inn
of
the
tenant
of
the
great
house
this
time
however
conditions
were
different
the
strip
of
road
lay
clean
and
hard
in
the
grip
of
a
four
days
frost
there
were
little
pools
of
ice
near
the
pavement
the
trees
leafless
and
stark
stood
motionless
against
the
clear
sky
although
it
was
early
in
the
afternoon
the
sun
was
already
sinking
beneath
a
bank
of
clouds
johnson
in
thick
tweeds
and
leggings
with
a
powdering
of
snow
upon
his
coat
carrying
a
gun
over
one
shoulder
and
a
cartridge
bag
suspended
from
the
other
made
his
appearance
coming
along
the
lane
from
the
hall
he
do
be
a
changed
man
that
for
sure
pank
observed
and
for
that
matter
craske
put
in
his
wife
be
a
changed
woman
i
mind
when
she
used
to
come
in
for
groceries
for
madame
always
looking
a
little
tired
almost
as
though
there
were
nothing
in
life
worth
caring
about
now
i
do
call
her
one
of
the
women
in
these
parts
it
worth
going
a
mile
to
see
her
and
gregory
together
either
on
horseback
or
out
with
the
beagles
they
say
the
innkeeper
began
hush
rawson
interrupted
i
believe
he
coming
in
johnson
had
hesitated
at
the
corner
and
glanced
at
his
watch
instead
of
taking
the
turn
to
the
great
house
he
swung
towards
the
inn
and
pausing
for
a
moment
outside
to
look
down
the
breech
of
his
gun
entered
with
a
cheery
greeting
rawson
at
once
stood
up
the
newcomer
waved
him
back
to
his
seat
do
let
me
disturb
any
one
he
begged
finding
a
convenient
corner
for
his
gun
and
relapsing
into
the
which
had
been
discreetly
vacated
by
craske
i
take
a
warming
drink
if
you
please
pank
a
wineglassful
of
sloe
gin
if
you
have
it
and
if
any
of
you
gentlemen
will
join
me
i
shall
be
proud
i
forgot
my
flask
this
morning
you
been
out
along
with
gregory
sir
rawson
enquired
we
been
after
snipe
on
the
mere
side
good
sport
but
chilly
shot
snipe
in
china
before
now
but
they
do
seem
in
such
a
hurry
as
these
norfolk
devils
gregory
wiped
my
eyes
more
than
once
gregory
a
fine
shot
at
what
i
may
call
the
irregular
birds
the
butler
ventured
snipe
and
woodcock
and
suchlike
you
pardon
me
saying
so
though
sir
i
rather
see
you
at
the
pheasants
i
noticed
the
last
twice
that
the
squire
put
you
at
the
awkward
corners
well
well
johnson
admitted
it
a
great
life
this
if
i
could
only
learn
to
stick
on
a
horse
foulds
you
have
to
keep
your
eye
open
for
another
one
up
to
my
weight
i
had
to
miss
a
day
hunting
last
week
i
do
that
with
pleasure
sir
the
veterinary
promised
there
a
sale
at
norwich
next
week
i
be
over
yonder
surely
johnson
drank
his
sloe
gin
and
held
out
the
glass
for
replenishment
good
warming
stuff
he
pronounced
you
may
all
like
to
know
that
i
heard
from
the
squire
this
morning
they
found
the
villa
at
cannes
in
great
shape
and
her
ladyship
has
walked
a
mile
every
day
since
they
been
there
it
do
seem
wonderful
the
innkeeper
declared
a
most
amazing
recovery
craske
echoed
to
see
her
lying
on
that
chair
month
after
month
no
one
would
ever
dream
that
she
end
her
days
marrying
and
walking
about
like
any
one
else
there
been
changes
in
these
parts
johnson
sir
since
you
come
the
latter
nodded
his
head
thoughtfully
there
have
indeed
he
agreed
one
did
feel
six
months
ago
the
grocer
continued
as
though
some
sort
of
cloud
were
hanging
over
the
village
what
with
the
poor
gentleman
as
we
thought
had
been
murdered
and
the
police
acting
so
round
the
place
and
all
the
time
talk
about
the
hall
and
the
ballaston
lands
coming
under
the
hammer
and
you
johnson
not
half
the
cheerful
gentleman
you
are
now
looking
so
solemn
as
though
you
had
something
on
your
mind
all
the
time
if
one
might
make
so
free
things
have
changed
certainly
johnson
acquiesced
knocking
out
the
ashes
from
his
pipe
and
relighting
it
preparatory
to
departure
the
ballaston
mortgages
for
instance
as
every
one
knows
have
been
paid
up
to
the
last
farthing
and
enough
left
over
from
little
enterprise
to
keep
every
one
in
