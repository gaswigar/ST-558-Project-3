amphitryon
a
play
by
moliere
translated
by
waller
amphitryon
was
played
for
the
first
time
in
paris
at
the
theatre
du
january
it
was
successfully
received
holding
the
boards
until
the
of
march
when
easter
intervened
after
the
of
the
theatre
it
was
played
half
a
dozen
times
more
the
same
year
and
continued
to
please
the
first
edition
was
published
in
note
it
is
perhaps
hardly
necessary
to
refer
the
reader
to
amphitryon
by
plautus
the
comedy
upon
which
moliere
charming
play
was
in
the
main
based
the
rendering
attempted
here
can
give
but
a
faint
reflection
of
the
original
for
hardly
any
comedy
of
moliere
loses
more
in
the
process
of
translation
amphitryon
prologue
mercury
on
a
cloud
night
in
a
chariot
drawn
by
two
horses
merc
wait
gentle
night
deign
to
stay
awhile
some
help
is
needed
from
you
i
have
two
words
to
say
to
you
from
jupiter
night
ah
ah
it
is
you
seigneur
mercury
who
would
have
thought
of
you
here
in
that
position
merc
well
feeling
tired
and
not
being
able
to
fulfil
the
different
duties
jupiter
ordered
me
i
quietly
sat
down
on
this
cloud
to
await
your
coming
night
you
jest
mercury
you
do
not
mean
it
does
it
become
the
gods
to
say
they
are
tired
merc
are
the
gods
made
of
iron
night
no
but
one
must
always
have
a
care
for
divine
decorum
there
are
certain
words
the
use
of
which
debases
this
sublime
quality
and
it
is
meet
that
these
should
be
left
to
men
because
they
are
unworthy
merc
you
speak
at
your
ease
fair
lady
from
a
swiftly
rolling
chariot
in
which
like
a
dame
free
from
care
you
are
drawn
by
two
fine
horses
wherever
you
like
but
it
is
not
the
same
with
me
such
is
my
miserable
fate
that
i
can
not
bear
the
poets
too
great
a
grudge
for
their
gross
impertinence
in
having
by
an
unjust
law
which
they
wish
to
retain
in
force
given
a
separate
conveyance
to
each
god
for
his
own
use
and
left
me
to
go
on
foot
me
like
a
village
messenger
though
as
everyone
knows
i
am
the
famous
messenger
of
the
sovereign
of
the
gods
on
the
earth
and
in
the
heavens
without
any
exaggeration
i
need
more
than
any
one
else
the
means
of
being
carried
about
because
of
all
the
duties
he
puts
upon
me
night
what
can
one
do
the
poets
do
what
pleases
them
it
is
not
the
only
stupidity
we
have
detected
in
these
gentlemen
but
surely
your
irritation
against
them
is
wrong
for
the
wings
at
your
feet
are
a
friendly
gift
of
theirs
merc
yes
but
does
going
more
quickly
tire
oneself
less
night
let
us
leave
the
matter
seigneur
mercury
and
learn
what
is
wanted
merc
jupiter
as
i
have
told
you
wishes
the
dark
aid
of
your
cloak
for
a
certain
gallant
adventure
which
a
new
love
affair
has
furnished
him
his
custom
is
not
new
to
you
i
believe
often
does
he
neglect
the
heavens
for
the
earth
and
you
are
not
ignorant
that
this
master
of
the
gods
loves
to
take
upon
himself
the
guise
of
man
to
woo
earthly
beauties
he
knows
a
hundred
ingenious
tricks
to
entrap
the
most
obdurate
he
has
felt
the
darts
of
alcmene
eyes
and
whilst
amphitryon
her
husband
commands
the
theban
troops
on
the
plains
of
boeotia
jupiter
has
taken
his
form
and
assuaged
his
pains
in
the
possession
of
the
sweetest
of
pleasures
the
condition
of
the
couple
is
propitious
to
his
desire
hymen
joined
them
only
a
few
days
ago
and
the
young
warmth
of
their
tender
love
suggested
to
jupiter
to
have
recourse
to
this
fine
artifice
his
stratagem
proved
successful
in
this
case
but
with
many
a
cherished
object
a
similar
disguise
would
not
be
of
any
use
it
is
not
always
a
sure
means
of
pleasing
to
adopt
the
form
of
a
husband
night
i
admire
jupiter
and
i
can
not
imagine
all
the
disguises
which
come
into
his
head
merc
by
these
means
he
wishes
to
taste
all
sorts
of
conditions
that
is
the
act
of
a
god
who
is
not
a
fool
however
mortals
may
regard
him
i
should
think
very
meanly
of
him
if
he
never
quitted
his
redoubtable
mien
and
were
always
in
the
heavens
standing
upon
his
dignity
in
my
opinion
there
is
nothing
more
idiotic
than
always
to
be
imprisoned
in
one
grandeur
above
all
a
lofty
rank
becomes
very
inconvenient
in
the
transports
of
amorous
ardour
jupiter
no
doubt
is
a
connoisseur
in
pleasure
and
he
knows
how
to
descend
from
the
height
of
his
supreme
glory
so
that
he
can
enter
into
everything
that
pleases
him
he
entirely
casts
aside
himself
and
then
it
is
no
longer
jupiter
who
appears
night
i
could
overlook
seeing
him
step
down
from
his
sublime
stage
to
that
of
men
since
he
wishes
to
enter
into
all
the
transports
which
their
natures
can
supply
and
join
in
their
jests
if
in
the
changes
which
take
his
fancy
he
would
confine
himself
to
nature
but
i
do
not
think
it
fitting
to
see
jupiter
as
a
bull
a
serpent
a
swan
or
what
not
and
it
does
not
astonish
me
that
it
is
sometimes
talked
about
merc
let
all
the
busybodies
talk
such
changes
have
their
own
charms
and
surpass
people
understanding
the
god
knows
what
he
does
in
this
affair
as
in
everything
else
in
the
movements
of
their
tender
passions
animals
are
not
so
loutish
as
one
might
think
night
let
us
return
to
the
lady
whose
favours
he
enjoys
if
by
his
stratagem
his
pursuit
is
successful
what
more
can
he
wish
what
can
i
do
merc
he
wishes
that
you
would
slacken
the
pace
of
your
horses
to
satisfy
the
passion
of
his
amorous
heart
and
so
make
of
a
delightful
night
the
longest
night
of
all
that
you
would
give
him
more
time
for
his
transports
and
retard
the
birth
of
day
since
it
will
hasten
the
return
of
him
whose
place
he
occupies
night
really
the
employment
which
the
great
jupiter
reserves
for
me
is
a
worthy
one
the
service
he
requires
of
me
passes
under
a
very
respectable
name
merc
you
are
somewhat
for
a
young
goddess
such
an
employment
is
not
debasing
except
among
people
of
mean
birth
when
one
has
the
happiness
of
belonging
to
lofty
rank
whatever
one
does
is
always
right
and
good
things
change
their
names
to
suit
what
one
may
be
night
you
know
more
about
such
matters
than
i
do
i
will
trust
to
your
enlightened
views
and
accept
this
employment
merc
come
come
now
madam
night
a
little
gently
i
beseech
you
the
world
gives
you
the
reputation
of
not
being
so
scrupulous
in
a
hundred
different
climes
you
are
made
the
confidant
of
many
gallant
adventures
and
if
i
may
speak
candidly
we
do
not
owe
each
other
anything
night
let
us
cease
these
reproaches
and
remain
what
we
are
let
us
not
give
men
cause
to
laugh
by
telling
each
other
the
truth
merc
adieu
i
am
going
there
to
play
my
part
in
this
business
promptly
to
strip
myself
of
the
form
of
mercury
and
to
take
in
its
place
the
figure
of
amphitryon
valet
night
i
am
going
to
keep
station
in
this
hemisphere
with
my
sombre
train
merc
good
day
night
night
adieu
mercury
mercury
descends
from
his
cloud
to
the
earth
and
night
goes
away
in
her
chariot
end
of
the
prologue
act
i
scene
i
sosie
who
goes
there
eh
my
fear
grows
with
every
step
gentlemen
i
am
a
friend
to
all
the
world
ah
what
unparalleled
boldness
to
be
out
at
this
hour
my
master
is
crowned
with
fame
but
what
a
villainous
trick
he
plays
me
here
what
if
he
had
any
love
for
his
neighbour
would
he
have
sent
me
out
in
such
a
black
night
could
he
not
just
as
well
have
waited
until
it
was
day
before
sending
me
to
announce
his
return
and
the
details
of
his
victory
to
what
servitude
are
thy
days
subjected
sosie
our
lot
is
far
more
hard
with
the
great
than
with
the
mean
they
insist
that
everything
in
nature
should
be
compelled
to
sacrifice
itself
for
them
night
and
day
hail
wind
peril
heat
cold
as
soon
as
they
speak
we
must
fly
twenty
years
of
assiduous
service
do
not
gain
us
any
consideration
from
them
the
least
little
whim
draws
down
upon
us
their
anger
notwithstanding
this
our
infatuated
hearts
cling
to
the
empty
honour
of
remaining
near
them
contented
with
the
false
idea
which
every
one
holds
that
we
are
happy
in
vain
reason
bids
us
retire
in
vain
our
spite
sometimes
consents
to
this
to
be
near
them
is
too
powerful
an
influence
on
our
zeal
and
the
least
favour
of
a
caressing
glance
immediately
us
but
at
last
i
see
our
house
through
the
darkness
and
my
fear
vanishes
i
must
prepare
some
speech
for
my
mission
i
must
give
alcmene
warlike
description
of
the
fierce
combat
which
put
our
enemies
to
flight
but
how
the
deuce
can
i
do
this
since
i
was
not
there
never
mind
let
us
talk
of
cut
and
thrust
as
though
i
were
an
eyewitness
how
many
people
describe
battles
from
which
they
remained
far
away
in
order
to
act
my
part
without
discredit
i
will
rehearse
it
a
little
this
is
the
chamber
into
which
i
am
ushered
as
the
messenger
this
lantern
is
alcmene
to
whom
i
have
to
speak
he
sets
his
lantern
on
the
ground
and
salutes
it
amphitryon
my
master
and
your
husband
good
that
is
a
fine
beginning
whose
mind
is
ever
full
of
your
charms
has
chosen
me
from
amongst
all
to
bring
tidings
of
the
success
of
his
arms
and
of
his
desire
to
be
near
you
really
my
poor
sosie
i
am
delighted
to
see
you
back
again
you
do
me
too
much
honour
my
lot
is
an
enviable
one
well
answered
is
amphitryon
as
a
man
of
courage
should
be
when
glory
leads
him
very
good
a
capital
idea
will
my
heart
be
charmed
and
satisfied
by
his
return
soon
as
possible
assuredly
madam
but
his
heart
desires
a
speedier
return
ah
what
state
has
the
war
left
him
what
says
he
what
does
he
ease
my
anxiety
he
says
less
than
he
does
madam
and
makes
his
enemies
tremble
plague
where
do
i
get
all
these
fine
speeches
are
the
rebels
doing
tell
me
what
is
their
condition
could
not
resist
our
efforts
madam
we
cut
them
to
pieces
put
their
chief
pterelas
to
death
took
telebos
by
assault
and
now
the
port
rings
with
our
prowess
what
a
success
ye
gods
who
could
ever
have
imagined
it
tell
me
sosie
how
it
happened
will
gladly
madam
and
without
boasting
i
can
tell
you
with
the
greatest
accuracy
the
details
of
this
victory
imagine
therefore
madam
that
telebos
is
on
this
side
he
marks
the
places
on
his
hand
or
on
the
ground
it
is
a
city
really
almost
as
large
as
thebes
the
river
is
say
there
here
our
people
encamped
and
that
space
was
occupied
by
our
enemies
on
a
height
somewhere
about
here
was
their
infantry
and
lower
down
on
the
right
side
was
their
cavalry
after
having
addressed
prayers
to
the
gods
and
issued
all
the
orders
the
signal
was
given
the
enemy
thinking
to
turn
our
flank
divided
their
horse
soldiers
into
three
platoons
but
we
soon
chilled
their
warmth
and
you
shall
see
how
here
is
our
vanguard
ready
to
begin
work
there
were
the
archers
of
our
king
creon
and
here
the
main
army
some
one
makes
a
slight
noise
which
was
just
going
to
stay
the
main
body
is
afraid
i
think
i
hear
some
noise
scene
ii
mercury
sosie
merc
under
the
form
of
sosie
under
this
mask
which
resembles
him
i
will
drive
away
the
babbler
from
here
his
unfortunate
arrival
may
disturb
the
pleasures
our
lovers
are
tasting
together
sos
my
heart
revives
a
little
perhaps
it
was
nothing
lest
anything
untoward
should
happen
however
i
will
go
in
to
finish
the
conversation
merc
i
shall
prevent
your
doing
that
unless
you
are
stronger
than
mercury
sos
this
night
seems
to
me
unusually
long
by
the
time
i
have
been
on
the
way
either
my
master
has
taken
evening
for
morning
or
lovely
phoebus
slumbers
too
long
in
bed
through
having
taken
too
much
wine
merc
with
what
irreverence
this
lubber
speaks
of
the
gods
my
arm
shall
soon
chastise
this
insolence
i
shall
have
a
fine
game
with
him
stealing
his
name
as
well
as
his
likeness
sos
ah
upon
my
word
i
was
right
i
am
done
for
miserable
creature
that
i
am
i
see
a
man
before
our
house
whose
mien
bodes
me
no
good
i
will
sing
a
little
to
show
some
semblance
of
assurance
he
sings
and
when
mercury
speaks
his
voice
weakens
little
by
little
merc
what
rascal
is
this
who
takes
the
unwarrantable
licence
of
singing
and
deafening
me
like
this
does
he
wish
me
to
curry
his
coat
for
him
sos
assuredly
that
fellow
does
not
like
music
merc
for
more
than
a
week
i
have
not
found
any
one
whose
bones
i
could
break
my
arm
will
lose
its
strength
in
this
idleness
i
must
look
out
for
some
one
back
to
get
my
wind
again
sos
what
the
deuce
of
a
fellow
is
this
my
heart
thrills
with
clutching
fear
but
why
should
i
tremble
thus
perhaps
the
rogue
is
as
much
afraid
as
i
am
and
talks
in
this
way
to
hide
his
fear
from
me
under
a
feigned
audacity
yes
yes
i
will
not
allow
him
to
think
me
a
goose
if
i
am
not
bold
i
will
try
to
appear
so
let
me
seek
courage
by
reason
he
is
alone
even
as
i
am
i
am
strong
i
have
a
good
master
and
there
is
our
house
merc
who
goes
there
sos
merc
who
i
sos
i
courage
sosie
merc
tell
me
what
is
your
condition
sos
to
be
a
man
and
to
speak
merc
are
you
a
master
or
a
servant
sos
as
fancy
takes
me
merc
where
are
you
going
sos
where
i
intend
to
go
merc
ah
this
annoys
me
sos
i
am
ravished
to
hear
it
merc
by
hook
or
by
crook
i
must
definitely
know
all
about
you
you
wretch
what
you
do
whence
you
come
before
the
day
breaks
where
you
are
going
and
who
you
may
be
sos
i
do
good
and
ill
by
turns
i
come
from
there
i
go
there
i
belong
to
my
master
merc
you
show
wit
and
i
see
you
think
to
play
the
man
of
importance
for
my
edification
i
feel
inclined
to
make
your
acquaintance
by
slapping
your
face
sos
mine
merc
yours
and
there
you
get
it
sharp
mercury
gives
him
a
slap
sos
ah
ah
this
is
a
fine
game
merc
no
it
is
only
a
laughing
matter
a
reply
to
your
quips
sos
good
heavens
friend
how
you
swing
out
your
arm
without
any
one
saying
anything
to
you
merc
these
are
my
lightest
clouts
little
ordinary
smacks
sos
if
i
were
as
hasty
as
you
we
should
have
a
fine
ado
merc
all
this
is
nothing
as
yet
it
is
merely
to
fill
up
time
we
shall
soon
see
something
else
but
let
us
continue
our
conversation
sos
i
give
up
the
game
he
turns
to
go
away
merc
where
are
you
going
sos
what
does
it
matter
to
you
merc
i
want
to
know
where
you
are
going
sos
i
am
going
to
open
that
door
why
do
you
detain
me
merc
if
you
dare
to
go
near

i
shall
rain
down
a
storm
of
blows
on
you

what
you
wish
to
hinder

from
entering

true

cease
therefore
to
jeer
at

and
leave
me
to
acquit
myself
where
my
duty
calls

stop
or
the
shortest
step
brings
down
upon
your

clattering
evidence
of
my
just
anger
all
you
have
just
said
is
mine
except
the
blows
it
is
i
whom
amphitryon
sent
to
alcmene
who
has
just
arrived
from
the
persian
port
i
who
have
come
to
announce
the
valour
of
his
arm
which
has
gained
us
a
glorious
victory
and
slain
the
chief
of
our
enemies
in
short
i
am
undoubtedly
sosie
son
of
dave
an
honest
shepherd
brother
of
arpage
who
died
in
a
foreign
land
husband
of
cleanthis
the
prude
whose
temper
drives
me
wild
i
who
received
a
thousand
cuts
from
a
whip
at
thebes
without
ever
saying
anything
about
it
and
who
was
once
publicly
branded
on
the
back
for
being
too
worthy
a
man
sos
he
is
right
if
he
were
not
sosie
he
could
not
know
all
he
says
all
this
is
so
astounding
that
even
i
begin
to
believe
him
a
little
in
fact
now
i
look
at
him
i
see
he
has
my
figure
looks
and
manners
i
wilt
ask
him
some
question
in
order
to
clear
up
this
mystery
what
did
amphitryon
obtain
as
his
share
of
all
the
plunder
taken
from
our
enemies
merc
five
fine
large
diamonds
beautifully
set
in
a
cluster
which
their
chief
wore
as
a
rare
piece
of
handicraft
sos
for
whom
does
he
intend
so
rich
a
present
merc
for
his
wife
he
intends
her
to
wear
it
sos
where
have
you
put
it
until
you
meet
her
merc
in
a
casket
sealed
with
the
arms
of
my
master
sos
he
does
not
tell
a
single
lie
at
any
turn
i
begin
to
doubt
myself
in
earnest
he
has
already
cowed
me
into
believing
him
to
be
sosie
and
he
might
even
reason
me
into
thinking
him
so
yet
when
i
touch
myself
and
recollect
it
seems
to
me
i
am
myself
where
can
i
find
some
light
that
will
clearly
make
my
way
plain
what
i
have
done
alone
and
what
no
one
has
seen
can
not
be
known
to
any
one
else
that
at
least
belongs
to
me
i
will
astonish
him
by
this
question
it
will
confound
him
and
we
shall
see
when
they
were
at
close
quarters
what
were
you
doing
in
our
tents
whither
you
ran
to
hide
yourself
away
merc
off
a
ham
sos
that
is
it
merc
which
i
unearthed
i
soon
cut
two
succulent
slices
they
suited
me
nicely
i
added
to
them
a
wine
which
was
usually
kept
dark
and
gloated
over
the
sight
of
it
before
i
tasted
it
so
i
took
heart
for
our
fighters
sos
this
unparalleled
proof
ends
matters
well
in
his
favour
and
unless
he
were
in
the
bottle
there
is
nothing
to
be
said
from
the
proofs
you
show
me
i
can
not
deny
that
you
are
sosie
i
admit
it
but
if
you
are
he
tell
me
whom
you
wish
me
to
be
for
i
must
be
someone
merc
when
i
shall
no
longer
be
sosie
you
may
be
he
i
consent
to
that
but
i
promise
you
it
shall
be
the
death
of
you
if
you
take
up
such
a
fancy
while
i
am
he
sos
all
this
confusion
turns
me
inside
out
for
reason
is
against
what
i
see
but
i
must
end
this
by
some
means
and
the
shortest
way
for
me
is
to
go
in
there
merc
oh
you
you
want
to
taste
the
stick
sos
what
is
the
matter
great
gods
he
makes
the
blows
ring
again
my
back
will
ache
for
a
month
i
will
leave
this
devil
of
a
fellow
and
return
to
the
harbour
o
just
heavens
what
a
fine
ambassador
i
have
been
merc
at
last
i
have
made
him
fly
this
treatment
has
paid
him
out

many
of
his
deeds

my
dear
alcmene

give
me
delight
in
enabling

they
might
betray
my

this
were
best
unrevealed
restrained
by
all
the
heavy
cares
with
which
the
glory
of
our
arms
held
me
bound
my
heart
has
stolen
from
the
duties
of
my
post
the
moments
it
has
just
given
to
your
charms
this
theft
which
i
have
consecrated
to
your
beauty
might
be
blamed
by
the
public
voice
and
the
only
witness
i
want
is
she
who
can
thank
me
for
it

i
take
great
interest

in
the
glory
which
your
illustrious
exploits
have
cast
upon
you
the
fame
of
your
victory
moves
my
heart
to
its
depths
but
when
i
see
that
this
disastrous
honour
keeps
my
lover
away
from
me
such
is
my
heart
feeling
that
i
can
not
forbear
to
think
ill
of
it
and
to
regret
the
high
order
which
makes
you
general
of
the
thebans
it
is
sweet
after
a
victory
to
see
the
glory
to
which
one
lover
has
been
raised
but
from
among
the
perils
attached
to
this
glory
a
deadly
blow
alas
may
soon
fall
with
how
many
fears
is
heart
wounded
at
the
report
of
the
least
skirmish
in
the
horror
of
such
a
thought
is
there
anything
that
can
console
for
the
threatened
stroke
and
with
whatever
laurels
the
victor
may
be
crowned
whatever
share
one
may
have
in
that
supreme
honour
is
it
worth
what
it
costs
a
tender
heart
which
trembles
every
moment
for
its
lover
jup
i
do
not
see
anything
in
you
but
what
inflames
my
passion
everything
shows
me
a
deeply
enamoured
heart
and
i
confess
it
is
a
great
delight
to
find
so
much
love
in
a
beloved
object
but
if
i
may
dare
say
so
one
scruple
in
the
tender
sentiments
which
you
show
me
causes
me
anxiety
and
in
order
to
enjoy
you
the
more
dear
alcmene
my
heart
would
rather
see
love
only
and
not
duty
in
the
favours
which
i
receive
from
you
may
they
arise
solely
from
affection
and
have
respect
to
my
person
only
let
not
my
condition
as
your
husband
be
the
reason
for
them
alc
yet
it
is
in
that
name
that
the
ardour
which
burns
me
holds
the
right
to
show
itself
i
do
not
understand
this
new
scruple
which
troubles
your
heart
jup
the
love
and
tenderness
which
i
have
for
you
far
exceeds
a
husband
in
these
sweet
moments
you
do
not
realise
its
delicacy
you
do
not
understand
that
a
heart
deeply
in
love
studiously
attaches
itself
to
a
hundred
little
trifles
and
is
restless
over
the
manner
of
being
happy
in
me
fair
and
charming
alcmene
you
see
a
lover
and
a
husband
but
to
speak
frankly
it
is
the
lover
that
appeals
to
me
when
near
you
i
feel
the
husband
restrains
him
this
lover
who
is
supremely
jealous
of
your
love
wishes
your
heart
to
abandon
itself
solely
to
him
his
passion
does
not
wish
anything
the
husband
gives
him
he
wishes
to
obtain
the
warmth
of
your
love
from
the
and
not
to
owe
anything
to
the
bonds
of
wedlock
or
to
a
duty
which
palls
and
makes
the
heart
sad
for
by
these
the
sweetness
of
the
most
cherished
favours
is
daily
poisoned
this
idea
in
short
tosses
him
to
and
fro
and
he
wishes
in
order
to
satisfy
his
scruples
that
you
would
differentiate
where
the
occasion
offends
him
the
husband
to
be
only
for
your
virtue
and
the
lover
to
have
the
whole
affection
and
tenderness
of
a
heart
known
to
be
full
of
kindness
alc
in
truth
amphitryon
you
must
be
jesting
to
talk
thus
i
should
be
afraid
anyone
who
heard
you
would
think
you
were
not
sane
jup
there
is
more
reason
in
this
discourse
alcmene
than
you
think
but
a
longer
stay
here
would
render
me
guilty
and
time
presses
for
my
return
to
port
adieu
the
stern
call
of
duty
tears
me
away
from
you
for
a
time
but
lovely
alcmene
i
beseech
you
at
least
to
think
of
the
lover
when
you
see
the
husband
alc
i
do
not
separate
what
the
gods
unite
both
husband
and
lover
are
very
precious
to
me
cle
o

how
delightful
are
the
caresses
of
an
ardently
cherished
husband
how
far
my
poor
husband
is
from
all
this
tenderness

i
must
tell

comes
a
certain
age

look
ridiculous

good
that
is
enough
leave
it
to
me
you
have
but
to
interrogate
me
amph
upon
the
order
which
i
lately
gave
you
sos
i
set
forth
under
skies
veiled
in
black
crape
swearing
bitterly
against
you
for
this
wretched
martyrdom
and
cursing
twenty
times
the
order
of
which
you
speak
amph
what
do
you
mean
you
villain
sos
you
have
only
to
speak
monsieur
and
i
shall
lie
if
you
desire
it
amph
that
is
how
a
valet
shows
his
zeal
for
us
never
mind
what
happened
to
you
on
the
way
sos
i
had
a
mortal
fright
at
the
least
thing
i
met
amph
poltroon
sos
nature
has
her
caprices
in
forming
us
she
gives
us
differing
inclinations
some
find
a
thousand
delights
in
exposing
themselves
i
find
them
in
taking
care
of
myself
amph
when
you
arrived
at
the
house
sos
when
i
reached
the
door
i
wished
to
rehearse
to
myself
for
a
short
time
in
what
tone
and
in
what
manner
i
should
give
a
glorious
account
of
the
battle
amph
what
followed
sos
some
one
came
to
annoy
and
trouble
me
amph
who
was
he
sos
sosie
another
i
jealous
of
your
orders
whom
you
sent
to
alcmene
from
the
port
and
who
has
as
full
knowledge
of
our
secrets
as
i
who
am
speaking
to
you
amph
what
nonsense
sos
no
monsieur
it
is
the
simple
truth
this
i
was
at
your
house
sooner
than
i
and
i
swear
to
you
i
was
there
before
i
had
arrived
amph
pray
where
does
all
this
cursed
nonsense
come
from
is
it
a
dream
is
it
drunkenness
or
a
sorry
joke
sos
no
it
is
the
thing
as
it
is
and
by
no
means
an
idle
tale
i
am
a
man
of
honour
i
give
you
my
word
and
you
must
please
believe
it
i
tell
you
believing
i
was
but
one
sosie
i
found
myself
two
at
your
house
and
of
these
two
i
piqued
with
jealousy
one
is
at
the
house
and
the
other
is
with
you
the
i
who
is
here
tired
out
found
the
other
i
fresh
jolly
and
active
having
no
other
anxiety
than
to
fight
and
break
bones
amph
i
confess
i
must
be
of
a
very
placid
temper
very
peaceable
very
gentle
to
permit
a
valet
to
entertain
me
with
such
nonsense
sos
if
you
become
angry
no
more
conference
between
us
you
know
all
will
be
over
at
once
amph
no
i
will
listen
to
you
without
being
carried
away
i
promised
it
but
tell
me
in
good
earnest
is
there
any
shadow
of
likelihood
in
this
new
mystery
which
you
have
just
told
me
sos
no
you
are
right
the
matter
must
appear
to
everyone
past
credit
it
is
a
fact
past
understanding
an
extravagant
ridiculous
tale
it
shocks
common
sense
but
it
is
none
the
less
a
fact
amph
how
can
anyone
believe
it
unless
he
has
taken
leave
of
his
senses
sos
i
myself
did
not
believe
it
without
extreme
difficulty
i
thought
i
was
losing
my
senses
when
i
saw
myself
two
and
for
a
long
time
i
treated
my
other
self
as
an
impostor
but
he
compelled
me
in
the
end
to
recognise
myself
i
saw
it
was
i
without
any
trickery
from
head
to
foot
he
is
like
a
noble
air
well
built
charming
manners
in
fact
two
peas
do
not
resemble
each
other
more
were
it
not
that
his
hands
are
a
little
too
heavy
i
should
be
perfectly
satisfied
amph
i
had
need
exhort
myself
to
patience
but
did
you
not
in
the
end
go
into
the
house
sos
good
go
in
ah
in
what
fashion
have
i
never
wished
to
listen
to
reason
did
i
not
forbid
myself
to
enter
our
door
amph
in
what
way
sos
with
a
stick
my
back
still
aches
from
it
amph
you
have
been
thrashed
sos
truly
amph
and
by
whom
sos
myself
amph
you
have
thrashed
yourself
sos
yes
i
not
the
i
who
is
here
but
the
i
from
the
house
who
whacks
soundly
amph
heaven
confound
you
for
talking
to
me
like
this
sos
i
am
not
joking
the
i
whom
i
have
just
met
has
great
advantages
over
the
i
who
speaks
to
you
he
has
a
strong
arm
and
great
courage
i
have
had
proofs
of
both

devil
of
an
i
has
licked
me
soundly

is
a
fellow
who
can
do
wonders

let
us
cease
this

you
seen
my
wife

no

why
not

for
a
sufficiently
strong
reason

who
hindered

scoundrel

yourself

must
i
repeat
the
same
thing
twenty
times
i
i
tell
you
this
i
who
is
more
robust
than
i
this
i
who
took
possession
of
the
door

force

i

made
me
slope
off

i
who
wishes
to
be
the
only

itself
known

is
at

house

i
who
has
shown
himself
to
be
my
master

has
racked
me
with
pain
amph
his
brain
must
be
addled
by
having
had
too
much
to
drink
this
morning
sos
may
i
be
hanged
if
i
have
had
anything
to
drink
but
water
i
take
my
oath
on
it
amph
then
your
senses
must
have
been
fast
asleep
some
silly
dream
has
shown
you
all
these
fairy
tales
and
confused
mysteries
which
you
wish
me
to
take
for
truths
sos
that
is
just
as
far
away
from
the
truth
i
have
not
slept
and
i
do
not
even
feel
inclined
that
way
i
am
speaking
to
you
i
was
wide
awake
this
morning
upon
my

so
well

me

order
you
to
be
silent
you
tire
my
brain
too
much
i
must
be
an
fool
to
have
the
patience
to
listen
to
the
nonsense
a
valet
has
to
say
sos
all
talk
is
nonsense
that
comes
from
a
man
who
is
unknown
if
a
great
man
were
to
say
it
it
would
be
exquisite
language
amph
let
us
go
in
without
waiting
any
longer
but
here
comes
alcmene
clothed
in
all
her
charms
doubtless
she
does
not
expect
me
so
soon
and
my
arrival
will
surprise
her
scene
ii
alcmene
cleanthis
amphitryon
sosie
alc
come
cleanthis
let
us
attend
the
gods
pay
them
our
homage
for
my
husband
sake
and
thank
them
for
the
glorious
success
of
which
thebes
by
his

reaps
the
advantage
o
ye
gods

grant
that
victorious
amphitryon
may
be
met
with
renewed
pleasure
by
his
wife
that
this
day
may
be
favourable
to
my
passion
and
restore
you
to
me
with
the
same
heart
may
i
again
find
as
much
love
as
my
heart
brings
to
you
alc
ah
have
you
returned
so
soon
amph
really
you
give
me
but
a
sorry
proof
of
your
love
this
have
you
returned
so
soon
is
scarcely
the
language
a
heart
really
inflamed
with
love
would
use
on
such
an
occasion
as
this
i
dared
to
flatter
myself
i
had
remained
away
from
you
too
long
the
expectation
of
an
ardently
longed
for
return
makes
each
moment
seem
of
great
length
the
absence
of
what
we
love
however
brief
it
may
be
is
always
too
long
alc
i
do
not
see
amph
no
alcmene
time
is
measured
in
such
cases
by
one
impatience
you
count
the
moments
of
absence
as
one
who
does
not
love
when
we
really
love
the
slightest
separation
kills
us
the
one
whom
we
love
to
see
never
returns
too
soon
i
confess
that
the
love
i
bear
you
has
cause
to
complain
of
your
reception
i
expected
different
expressions
of
joy
and
tenderness
from
your
heart
alc
i
can
not
understand
on
what
you
found
the
words
you
have
just
uttered
if
you
complain
of
me
upon
my
word
i
do
not
know
what
would
satisfy
you
i
think
i
showed
a
sufficiently
tender
joy
last
night
at
your
happy
return
my
heart
responded
by
every
means
you
could
wish
to
the
claims
of
your
affection
amph
in
what
way
alc
did
i
not
clearly
show
the
sudden
transports
of
a
perfect
joy
could
a
heart
feelings
be
better
expressed
at
the
return
of
a
husband
who
is
tenderly
loved
amph
what
do
you
say
alc
that
even
your
affection
showed
an
inconceivable
joy
at
my
reception
and
that
as
you
left
me
at
break
of
day
i
do
not
see
that
my
surprise
at
this
sudden
return
is
so
guilty
amph
did
you
in
a
dream
last
night
alcmene
anticipate
in
idea
the
reality
of
my
hastened
return
and
having
perhaps
treated
me
kindly
in
your
sleep
does
your
heart
think
it
has
fully
acquitted
itself
of
its
duty
to
my
passion
alc
has
some
malignant
vapour
in
your
mind
amphitryon
clouded
the
truth
of
last
night
return
does
your
heart
pretend
to
take
away
from
me
the
credit
of
all
the
gentle
affection
i
showed
you
in
my
tender
welcome
amph
this
vapour
you
attribute
to
me
seems
to
me
somewhat
strange
alc
it
is
in
return
for
the
dream
which
you
attribute
to
me
amph
unless
it
is
because
of
a
dream
what
you
have
just
now
told
me
is
entirely
inexcusable
alc
unless
it
is
a
vapour
which
troubles
your
mind
what
i
have
heard
from
you
can
not
be
justified
amph
let
us
leave
this
vapour
for
a
moment
alcmene
alc
let
us
leave
this
dream
for
a
moment
amphitryon
amph
one
can
not
jest
on
the
subject
in
question
without
being
carried
too
far
alc
undoubtedly
and
as
a
sure
proof
of
it
i
begin
to
feel
somewhat
uneasy
amph
is
it
thus
you
wish
to
try
to
make
amends
for
the
welcome
of
which
i
complain
alc
do
you
desire
to
try
to
amuse
yourself
by
this
feint
amph
for
heaven
sake
i
beseech
you
alcmene
let
us
cease
this
and
talk
seriously
alc
you
carry
your
amusement
too
far
amphitryon
let
there
be
an
end
to
this
raillery
amph
do
you
really
dare
maintain
to
my
face
that
i
was
seen
here
before
this
hour
alc
have
you
really
the
assurance
to
deny
that
you
came
here
early
yesterday
evening
amph
i
i
came
yesterday
alc
certainly
and
you
went
away
again
before
dawn
amph
heavens
was
ever
such
a
debate
as
this
heard
before
who
would
not
be
astonished
at
all
this
sosie
sos
she
needs
six
grains
of
hellebore
monsieur
her
brain
is
turned
amph
alcmene
in
the
name
of
all
the
gods
this
discourse
will
have
a
strange
ending
recollect
your
senses
a
little
better
and
think
what
you
say
alc
i
am
indeed
thinking
seriously
all
in
the
house
saw
your
arrival
i
am
ignorant
what
motive
makes
you
act
thus
but
if
the
thing
were
in
need
of
proof
if
it
were
true
that
such
a
thing
could
be
forgotten
from
whom
but
from
you
could
i
have
heard
the
news
of
the
latest
of
all
your
battles
and
of
the
five
diamonds
worn
by
pterelas
who
was
plunged
into
eternal
night
by
the
strength
of
your
arm
could
one
wish
for
surer
testimony
amph
what
i
have
already
given
you
the
cluster
of
diamonds
which
i
had
for
my
share
and
intended
for
you
alc
assuredly
it
is
not
difficult
to
convince
you
thoroughly
on
that
point
amph
how
alc
here
it
is
amph
sosie
sos
she
is
jesting
i
have
it
here
monsieur
the
feint
is
useless
amph
the
seal
is
whole
alc
is
it
a
vision
there
will
you
think
this
proof
strong
enough
amph
ah
heaven
o
just
heaven
alc
come
amphitryon
you
are
joking
in
acting
thus
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
it
amph
break
this
seal
quickly
sos
having
opened
the
casket
upon
my
word
the
casket
is
empty
it
must
have
been
taken
out
by
witchcraft
or
else
it
came
by
itself
a
guide
to
her
whom
it
knew
it
was
intended
to
adorn
amph
o
gods
whose
power
governs
all
things
what
is
this
adventure
what
can
i
augur
from
it
that
does
not
clutch
at
my
heart
sos
if
she
speaks
the
truth
we
have
the
same
lot
and
like
me
monsieur
you
are
double
amph
be
silent
alc
why
are
you
so
surprised
what
causes
all
this
confusion
amph
o
heaven
what
strange
perplexity
i
see
incidents
which
surpass
nature
and
my
honour
fears
an
adventure
which
my
mind
does
not
understand
alc
do
you
still
wish
to
deny
your
hasty
return
when
you
have
this
sensible
proof
of
it
amph
no
but
if
it
be
possible
deign
to
tell
me
what
passed
at
this
return
alc
since
you
ask
an
account
of
the
matter
you
still
say
it
was
not
you
amph
pardon
me
but
i
have
a
certain
reason
which
makes
me
ask
you
to
give
us
this
account
alc
have
the
important
cares
which
perhaps
engross
you
made
you
so
quickly
lose
the
remembrance
of
it
amph
perhaps
but
in
short
you
would
please
me
by
telling
me
the
whole
story
alc
the
story
is
not
long
i
advanced
towards
you
full
of
a
delighted
surprise
i
embraced
you
tenderly
and
showed
my
joy
more
than
once
amph
to
himself
ah
i
could
have
done
without
so
sweet
a
welcome
alc
you
first
made
me
this
valuable
gift
which
you
destined
for
me
from
the
spoils
of
the
conquered
your
heart
vehemently
unfolded
to
me
all
the
violence
of
its
love
and
the
annoying
duties
which
had
kept
it
enchained
the
happiness
of
seeing
me
again
the
torments
of
absence
all
the
care
which
your
impatience
to
return
had
given
you
never
has
your
love
on
similar
occasions
seemed
to
me
so
tender
and
so
passionate
amph
to
himself
can
one
be
more
cruelly
tortured
alc
as
you
may
well
believe
these
transports
and
this
tenderness
did
not
displease
me
if
i
must
confess
it
amphitryon
my
heart
found
a
thousand
charms
in
them
amph
what
followed
pray
alc
we
interrupted
each
other
with
a
thousand
questions
concerning
each
other
the
table

what
a
question

ah
this
is
the
most
cruel
stroke
of
all
my
jealous
passion
trembled
to
assure
itself
of

do
you
blush
so
deeply
at

done

treat

this
despair
makes
me
capable
of

unworthy

the
deed
speaks
for
itself
the
imposture
is
frightful
it
is
too
great
an
insult
to
accuse
me
of
infidelity
if
these
confused
transports
mean
that
you
seek
a
pretext
to
break
the
nuptial
bonds
which
hold
me
enchained
to
you
all
these
pretences
are
superfluous

determined

shall
be
broken

unworthy
affront
which
i
now
learn
has
been
done

what
you
must
prepare

that
can
be
expected

may
not
perhaps
remain
there
the
dishonour
is
sure
my
misery
is
made
plain
to
me

my
pride
in

would
hide
it
from

positively
avouch

not
leave

will
go

seek
him

that
i
may
confound
you
about

imputed
to

will
penetrate
to
the

apprehensive

should
abstain
from

have

ridiculous

maintain
theirs
is
a
worthless

which

the
justifiable
transports
of
a
fit
of
jealousy
jealousy
makes
impressions
the
force
of
which
oftentimes
carries
us
beyond
our
control
at
such
times
the
most
discreet
mind
no
doubt
finds
it
difficult
enough
to
answer
for
its
deeds
the
violence
of
a
heart
which
may
have
been
deluded
has
in
its
very
delusion
a
for
an
aggrieved
soul
and
the
love
that
gave
birth
to
its
fears
furnishes
in
spite
of
all
its
violence
at
least
some
reasons
to
urge
as
excuse
outbursts
such
as
these
ever
have
love
as
an
excuse
against
anger
for
love
gave
birth
to
them
and
we
can
easily
pardon
what
we
can
not
control
but
to
fly
into
uncontrollable
fury
in
gaiety
of
heart
and
so
causelessly
and
keenly
to
wound
the
tenderness
and
honour
of
a
heart
that
dearly
loves
you
ah
it
is
too
cruel
a
blow
my
grief
can
never
forget
it
jup
yes
you
are
right
alcmene
i
admit
it
this
action
is
unquestionably
an
odious
crime
i
do
not
pretend
to
justify
it
longer
yet
allow
my
heart
to
defend
itself
in
your
eyes
and
let
it
reveal
to
you
who
is
to
blame
for
this
insulting
fury
to
tell
you
frankly
it
is
the
husband
alcmene
who
has
done
this
wrong
it
is
the
husband
whom
you
must
blame
the
lover
has
no
share
in
this
churlish
anger
his
heart
is
not
capable
of
offending
you
he
has
too
much
respect
and
affection
for
you
ever
to
think
of
it
had
he
been
guilty
of
the
crime
of
doing
aught
that
could
wound
you
he
would
pierce
himself
with
a
hundred
stabs
before
your
eyes
but
the
husband
has
cast
aside
that
humble
submission
which
should
always
be
yours
by
his
harsh
deeds
the
husband
has
made
himself
known
he
thought
the
rights
of
marriage
allowed
him
everything
yes
it
is
he
no
doubt
who
is
guilty
towards
you
he
only
has
your
lovely
person
hate
detest
the
husband
i
consent
to
it
i
yield
him
to
your
mercy
but
alcmene
spare
the
lover
from
the
anger
which
such
an
offence
gives
you
do
not
let
him
suffer
differentiate
between
him
and
the
guilty
one
and
finally
in
order
to
be
just
do
not
punish
him
for
what
he
has
not
done
alc
oh
all
these
subtleties
are
but
frivolous
excuses
such
language
only
annoys
incensed
minds
in
vain
do
you
use
these
ridiculous
prevarications
i
do
not
make
any
distinction
in
him
who
offends
me
everything
in
him
becomes
the
object
of
my
anger
the
lover
and
the
husband
are
alike
confounded
in
its
just
violence
both
occupy
my
thoughts
both
are
painted
in
the
same
colours
by
my
wounded
heart
both
are
guilty
both
have
offended
me
and
both
are
odious
to
me
jup
well
then
since
you
wish
it
i
must
charge
myself
with
the
offence
yes
you
are
right
when
you
sacrifice
me
as
a
guilty
victim
to
your
resentment
anger
towards
me
sways
you
it
is
but
too
just
and
all
the
terrible
wrath
you
show
causes
me
to
suffer
only
lawful
torments
it
is
right
you
should
shun
my
presence
and
in
your
anger
threaten
to
flee
from
me
everywhere
i
must
be
a
detestable
object
to
you
you
are
right
in
thinking
ill
of
me
my
crime
in
being
offensive
in
your
charming
eyes
surpasses
every
horror
it
is
a
crime
that
offends
men
and
gods
in
short
as
punishment
for
my
insolence
i
deserve
that
your
hatred
should
vent
its
utmost
upon
me
i
beg
your
forgiveness
i
beg
it
upon
my
knees
i
beg
it
for
the
sake
of
the
most
lively
passion
of
the
tenderest
love
for
you
which
has
ever
been
kindled
in
a
human
breast
if
charming
alcmene
your
heart
refuses
me
the
pardon
which
i
have
the
audacity
to
seek
then
shall
a
stroke
put
an
end
to
my
life
and
release
me
from
the
harsh
severity
of
a
penalty
which
i
can
no
longer
bear
yes
this
state
of
things
drives
me
to
despair
do
not
think
alcmene
that
enamoured
as
i
am
of
your
celestial
charms
i
can
live
a
day
under
your
wrath
even
these
moments
agony
is
barbarously
prolonged
and
my
sad
heart
sinks
under
their
mortal
blows
the
cruel
wounds
of
a
thousand
vultures
are
not
comparable
in
any
way
to
my
lively
grief
alcmene
you
have
but
to
tell
me
i
need
not
hope
for
pardon
and
immediately
this
sword
by
a
happy
thrust
shall
pierce
the
heart
of
a
miserable
wretch
before
your
eyes
this
heart
this
traitorous
heart
too
deserving
of
death
since
it
has
offended
an
adorable
being
will
be
happy
if
in
descending
into
the
place
of
shades
my
death
appeases
your
anger
and
after
this
wretched
day
it
leaves
in
your
soul
no
impression
of
hatred
in
remembering
my
love
this
is
all
i
ask
as
a
sovereign
favour
alc
ah
cruel
husband
jup

alcmene

alc
must
i
still
keep
some
kindness
for
you
who
insult
me
by
so
many
indignities
jup
whatever
resentment
an
outrage
causes
us
can
it
hold
out
against
the
remorse
of
a
heart
deeply
in
love
alc
a
heart
full
of
passion
would
rather
expose
itself
to
a
thousand
deaths
than
offend
the
object
beloved
jup
the
more
one
loves
the
easier
it
is
alc
no
do
not
speak
to
me
any
longer
about
it
you
deserve
my
hatred
jup
you
hate
me
then
alc
i
make
every
effort
to
do
so
and
it
annoys
me
to
feel
that
all
your
insults
do
not
yet
carry
my
vengeance
so
far
as
yield
to
it
jup
but
why
this
violence
since
i
offer
to
kill
myself
to
satisfy
your
revenge
pronounce
the
sentence
and
immediately
i
will
obey
alc
it
is
impossible
to
wish
for
another
death
if
hatred
be
absent
jup
i
can
not
live
unless
you
abandon
the
wrath
that
overwhelms
me
and
unless
you
grant
me
the
favour
of
a
pardon
which
i
beg
at
your
feet
decide
to
do
one
or
the
other
quickly
to
punish
or
to
absolve
alc
alas
the
only
resolution
i
can
take
is
but
too
clearly
apparent
my
heart
has
too
plainly
betrayed
me
for
me
to
wish
to
maintain
this
anger
is
it
not
to
say
we
pardon
when
we
say
we
can
not

ah

oftentimes
produces
resemblances

some

have
adopted

it

inconceivable

be

glorious
a

should
be

to
believe
them
at
the

question
her
again
upon

a
silly
fancy
that

taken
advantage
of

do
not

to
anger

draw
my
sword

is
a
bad
way

more
gentle

more
certain
one
of

may
seem
