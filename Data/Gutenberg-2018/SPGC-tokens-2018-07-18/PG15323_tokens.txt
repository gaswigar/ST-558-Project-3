i
see
the

good
evening
sir
a
bit
gusty
very
much
so
sergeant
i
replied
i
think
i
will
step
into
your
hut
for
a
moment
and
light
my
pipe
if
i
may
certainly
sir
matches
are
too
scarce
nowadays
to
take
risks
with
but
it
looks
as
if
the
storm
had
blown
over
i
not
sorry
said
i
entering
the
little
hut
like
a
which
stands
at
the
entrance
to
this
old
village
high
street
for
accommodation
of
the
officer
on
point
duty
at
that
spot
i
have
a
longish
walk
before
me
yes
your
place
is
right
off
the
beat
is
it
mused
my
acquaintance
as
sheltered
from
the
keen
wind
i
began
to
load
my
briar
very
inconvenient
i
always
thought
it
for
a
gentleman
who
gets
about
as
much
as
you
do
that
why
i
like
it
i
explained
if
i
lived
anywhere
accessible
i
should
never
get
a
moment
peace
you
see
at
the
same
time
i
have
to
be
within
an
hour
journey
of
fleet
street
i
often
stopped
for
a
chat
at
this
point
and
i
was
acquainted
with
most
of
the
men
of
division
on
whom
the
duty
devolved
from
time
to
time
it
was
a
lonely
spot
at
night
when
the
residents
in
the
neighborhood
had
retired
so
that
the
darkened
houses
seemed
to
withdraw
yet
farther
into
the
gardens
separating
them
from
the
highroad
a
relic
of
the
days
when
trains
and
were
not
dusk
restored
something
of
an
atmosphere
to
the
village
street
disguising
the
red
brick
and
stucco
which
in
many
cases
had
displaced
the
houses
of
the
past
yet
it
was
possible
in
still
weather
to
hear
the
muted
bombilation
of
the
sleepless
city
and
when
the
wind
was
in
the
north
to
count
the
of
the
great
bell
of
paul
standing
in
the
shelter
of
the
little
hut
i
listened
to
the
rain
dripping
from
branches
and
to
the
gurgling
of
a
turgid
little
stream
which
flowed
along
the
gutter
near
my
feet
whilst
now
and
again
swift
gusts
of
the
expiring
tempest
would
set
tossing
the
branches
of
the
trees
which
lined
the
way
it
much
cooler
said
the
sergeant
i
nodded
being
in
the
act
of
lighting
my
pipe
the
storm
had
interrupted
a
spell
of
that
tropical
weather
which
sometimes
in
july
and
august
brings
the
breath
of
africa
to
london
and
this
coolness
resulting
from
the
storm
was
very
welcome
then
well
good
night
i
said
and
was
about
to
pursue
my
way
when
the
telephone
bell
in
the
rang
sharply
hullo
called
the
sergeant
i
paused
idly
curious
concerning
the
message
and
the
red
house
continued
the
sergeant
in
college
road
yes
i
know
it
it
on
bolton
beat
and
he
is
due
here
now
very
good
tell
him
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turning
to
me
smiled
and
nodded
his
head
resignedly
the
police
get
some
funny
jobs
sir
he
confided
only
last
night
a
gentleman
rang
up
the
station
and
asked
them
to
tell
me
to
stop
a
short
stout
lady
with
yellow
hair
and
a
big
blue
hat
that
was
the
only
description
as
she
passed
this
point
and
to
inform
her
that
her
husband
had
had
to
go
out
but
that
he
had
left
the
just
inside
the
he
laughed
now
he
resumed
here
somebody
just
rung
up
to
say
that
he
thinks
only
mind
you
that
he
has
forgotten
to
lock
his
garage
and
will
the
constable
on
that
beat
see
if
the
keys
have
been
left
behind
if
so
will
he
lock
the
door
from
the
inside
go
out
through
the
back
lock
that
door
and
leave
the
keys
at
the
station
on
coming
off
duty
yes
i
said
there
are
some
people
in
the
world
but
do
you
mean
the
red
house
in
college
road
that
it
replied
the
sergeant
stepping
out
of
the
hut
and
looking
intently
to
the
left
ah
here
comes
bolton
he
referred
to
a
stolid
constable
who
at
that
moment
came
plodding
across
the
muddy
road
and
a
job
for
you
bolton
he
cried
listen
you
know
the
red
house
in
college
road
bolton
removed
his
helmet
and
scratched
his
head
let
me
see
he
mused
it
on
the
right
no
no
i
interrupted
it
is
a
house
about
down
on
the
left
very
secluded
with
a
high
brick
wall
in
front
oh
you
mean
the
house
inquired
the
constable
just
what
i
was
about
to
remark
sergeant
said
i
turning
to
my
acquaintance
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
the
red
house
has
been
vacant
for
twelve
months
or
more
has
it
exclaimed
the
sergeant
that
funny
still
it
none
of
my
business
besides
it
may
have
been
let
within
the
last
few
days
anyway
listen
bolton
you
are
to
see
if
the
garage
is
unlocked
if
it
is
and
the
keys
are
there
go
in
and
lock
the
door
behind
you
there
another
door
at
the
other
end
go
out
and
lock
that
too
leave
the
keys
at
the
depôt
when
you
go
off
got
that
fixed
yes
replied
bolton
and
he
stood
helmet
in
hand
half
inaudibly
muttering
the
sergeant
instructions
evidently
with
the
idea
of
impressing
them
upon
his
memory
i
have
to
pass
the
red
house
constable
i
interrupted
and
as
you
seem
doubtful
respecting
its
whereabouts
i
will
point
the
place
out
to
you
thank
you
sir
said
bolton
replacing
his
helmet
and
ceasing
to
mutter
once
more
good
night
sergeant
i
cried
and
met
by
a
keen
gust
of
wind
which
came
sweeping
down
the
village
street
showering
cascades
of
water
from
the
leaves
above
i
set
out
in
step
with
my
stolid
companion
it
is
supposed
poetically
that
unusual
events
cast
their
shadows
before
them
and
i
am
prepared
to
maintain
the
correctness
of
such
a
belief
but
unless
the
silence
of
the
constable
who
walked
beside
me
was
due
to
the
unseen
presence
of
such
a
shadow
and
not
to
a
habitual
taciturnity
there
was
nothing
in
that
march
through
the
deserted
streets
calculated
to
arouse
me
to
the
fact
that
i
was
entering
upon
the
first
phase
of
an
experience
more
strange
and
infinitely
more
horrible
than
any
of
which
i
had
ever
known
or
even
read
the
shadow
had
not
yet
reached
me
we
talked
little
enough
on
the
way
for
the
breeze
when
it
came
was
keen
and
troublesome
so
that
i
was
often
engaged
in
clutching
my
hat
except
for
a
object
obviously
a
member
of
the
tramp
fraternity
who
passed
us
near
the
gate
of
the
old
chapel
we
met
never
a
soul
from
the
time
that
we
left
the
until
the
moment
when
the
high
brick
wall
guarding
the
red
house
came
into
view
beyond
a
line
of
glistening
wet
hedgerow
this
is
the
house
constable
i
said
the
garage
is
beyond
the
main
entrance
we
proceeded
as
far
as
the
closed
gates
whereupon
there
you
are
sir
said
bolton
triumphantly
i
told
you
it
was
empty
an
estate
agent
bill
faced
us
setting
forth
the
desirable
features
of
the
residence
the
number
of
bedrooms
and
reception
rooms
modern
conveniences
garage
together
with
the
extent
of
the
garden
lawn
and
orchard
a
faint
creaking
sound
drew
my
glance
upward
and
stepping
back
a
pace
i
stared
at
a
projecting
above
the
wall
which
bore
two
duplicates
of
the
bill
posted
upon
the
gate
that
seems
to
confirm
it
i
declared
peering
through
the
trees
in
the
direction
of
the
house
the
place
has
all
the
appearance
of
being
deserted
there
some
mistake
muttered
bolton
then
the
mistake
is
not
ours
i
replied
see
the
bills
are
headed
be
let
or
sold
the
red
house
etc
h
growled
bolton
it
a
funny
go
this
is
suppose
we
have
a
look
at
the
garage
we
walked
along
together
to
where
set
back
in
a
recess
i
had
often
observed
the
doors
of
a
garage
evidently
added
to
the
building
by
some
recent
occupier
dangling
from
a
key
placed
in
the
lock
was
a
ring
to
which
another
key
was
attached
well
i
blowed
said
bolton
this
a
funny
go
this
is
he
unlocked
the
door
and
swept
the
interior
of
the
place
with
a
ray
of
light
cast
by
his
lantern
there
were
one
or
two
petrol
cans
and
some
odd
lumber
suggesting
that
the
garage
had
been
recently
used
but
no
car
and
indeed
nothing
of
sufficient
value
to
have
interested
even
such
a
derelict
as
the
man
whom
we
had
passed
some
ten
minutes
before
that
is
if
i
except
a
large
and
which
rested
only
a
foot
or
so
from
the
entrance
so
as
partly
to
block
it
and
which
from
its
appearance
might
possibly
have
contained
spare
parts
i
noticed
with
vague
curiosity
a
device
crudely
representing
a
seated
cat
which
was
painted
in
green
upon
the
case
if
there
ever
was
anything
here
said
bolton
it
been
pinched
and
we
locking
the
stable
door
after
the
horse
has
gone
you
bear
me
out
sir
if
there
any
complaint
certainly
i
replied
technically
i
shall
be
trespassing
if
i
come
in
with
you
so
i
shall
say
good
night
good
night
sir
cried
the
constable
and
entering
the
empty
garage
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
i
set
off
briskly
alone
towards
the
cottage
which
i
had
made
my
home
i
have
since
thought
that
the
motives
which
had
induced
me
to
choose
this
secluded
residence
were
of
a
peculiarly
selfish
order
whilst
i
liked
sometimes
to
be
among
my
fellowmen
and
whilst
i
rarely
missed
an
important
first
night
in
london
my
inherent
weakness
for
obscure
studies
and
another
motive
to
which
i
may
refer
later
had
caused
me
to
abandon
my
chambers
in
the
temple
and
to
retire
with
my
library
to
this
odd
little
backwater
where
my
only
link
with
fleet
street
with
the
land
of
theaters
and
clubs
and
noise
and
glitter
was
the
telephone
i
scarcely
need
add
that
i
had
sufficient
private
means
to
enable
me
to
indulge
these
whims
otherwise
as
a
working
journalist
i
must
have
been
content
to
remain
nearer
to
the
heart
of
things
as
it
was
i
followed
the
careless
existence
of
the
independent
and
since
my
work
was
accounted
above
the
average
i
was
enabled
to
pick
and
choose
the
subjects
with
which
i
should
deal
mine
was
not
an
ambitious
nature
or
it
may
have
been
that
stimulus
was
lacking
and
all
i
wrote
i
wrote
for
the
mere
joy
of
writing
whilst
my
studies
of
which
i
shall
have
occasion
to
speak
presently
were
not
of
a
nature
calculated
to
swell
my
coffers
in
this
age
little
did
i
know
how
abruptly
this
chosen
calm
of
my
life
was
to
be
broken
nor
how
these
same
studies
were
to
be
turned
in
a
new
and
strange
direction
but
if
on
this
night
which
was
to
witness
the
overture
of
a
horrible
drama
i
had
not
hitherto
experienced
any
premonition
of
the
coming
of
those
dark
forces
which
were
to
change
the
whole
tenor
of
my
existence
suddenly
now
in
sight
of
the
elm
tree
which
stood
before
my
cottage
the
reached
me
only
thus
can
i
describe
a
feeling
otherwise
unaccountable
which
prompted
me
to
check
my
steps
and
to
listen
a
gust
of
wind
had
just
died
away
leaving
the
night
silent
save
for
the
dripping
of
rain
from
the
leaves
and
the
vague
and
remote
roar
of
the
town
once
faintly
i
thought
i
detected
the
howling
of
a
dog
i
had
heard
nothing
in
the
nature
of
following
footsteps
yet
turning
swiftly
i
did
not
doubt
that
i
should
detect
the
presence
of
a
follower
of
some
kind
this
conviction
seized
me
suddenly
and
as
i
have
said
unaccountably
nor
was
i
wrong
in
my
surmise
fifty
yards
behind
me
a
vaguely
defined
figure
showed
for
an
instant
outlined
against
the
light
of
a
distant
lamp
ere
melting
into
the
dense
shadow
cast
by
a
clump
of
trees
near
the
roadside
standing
quite
still
i
stared
in
the
direction
of
the
patch
of
shadow
for
several
moments
it
may
be
said
that
there
was
nothing
to
occasion
alarm
or
even
curiosity
in
the
appearance
of
a
stray
pedestrian
at
that
hour
for
it
was
little
after
midnight
indeed
thus
i
argued
with
myself
whereby
i
admit
that
at
sight
of
that
figure
i
had
experienced
a
sensation
which
was
compounded
not
only
of
alarm
and
curiosity
but
also
of
some
other
emotion
which
even
now
i
find
it
hard
to
define
instantly
i
knew
that
the
lithe
shape
glimpsed
but
instantaneously
was
that
of
no
chance
pedestrian
was
indeed
that
of
no
ordinary
being
at
the
same
moment
i
heard
again
unmistakably
the
howling
of
a
dog
having
said
so
much
why
should
i
not
admit
that
turning
again
very
quickly
i
hurried
on
to
the
gate
of
my
cottage
and
heaved
a
great
sigh
of
relief
when
i
heard
the
reassuring
bang
of
the
door
as
i
closed
it
behind
me
coates
my
batman
had
turned
in
having
placed
a
cold
repast
upon
the
table
in
the
little
but
although
i
required
nothing
to
eat
i
partook
of
a
stiff
whisky
and
soda
idly
glancing
at
two
or
three
letters
which
lay
upon
the
table
they
proved
to
contain
nothing
of
very
great
importance
and
having
smoked
a
final
cigarette
i
turned
out
the
light
in
the
and
walked
into
the
bedroom
for
the
cottage
was
of
bungalow
pattern
and
crossing
the
darkened
room
stood
looking
out
of
the
window
it
commanded
a
view
of
a
little
and
beyond
of
a
high
hedge
with
glimpses
of
sentinel
trees
lining
the
main
road
the
wind
had
dropped
entirely
but
clouds
were
racing
across
the
sky
at
a
tremendous
speed
so
that
the
nearly
full
moon
alternately
appeared
and
disappeared
producing
an
effect
of
light
and
shadow
at
one
moment
a
prospect
stretched
before
me
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
in
the
next
i
might
have
been
looking
into
a
cavern
as
some
angry
cloud
swept
across
the
face
of
the
moon
to
plunge
the
scene
into
utter
darkness
and
it
was
during
such
a
dark
spell
and
at
the
very
moment
that
i
turned
aside
to
light
the
lamp
that
i
saw
from
a
spot
ten
yards
removed
low
down
under
the
hedges
bordering
the
garden
they
looked
up
at
me
those
great
glittering
cat
eyes
so
that
i
stifled
an
exclamation
drawing
back
instinctively
from
the
window
a
tiger
i
thought
or
some
kindred
wild
beast
must
have
escaped
from
captivity
and
so
rapidly
does
the
mind
work
at
such
times
that
instinctively
i
had
reviewed
the
several
sporting
pieces
in
my
possession
and
had
selected
a
rifle
which
had
proved
serviceable
in
india
ere
i
had
taken
one
step
towards
the
door
before
that
step
could
be
taken
the
light
of
the
moon
again
flooded
the
garden
and
although
there
was
no
opening
in
the
hedge
by
which
even
a

chapter
ii
the
sign
of
the
cat
when
coates
brought
in
my
tea
newspapers
and
letters
in
the
morning
i
awakened
with
a
start
and
has
there
been
any
rain
during
the
night
coates
i
asked
coates
whose
unruffled
calm
at
all
times
provided
an
excellent
sedative
replied
not
since
a
little
before
midnight
sir
ah
said
i
and
have
you
been
in
the
garden
this
morning
coates
yes
sir
he
replied
for
raspberries
for
breakfast
sir
but
not
on
this
side
of
the
cottage
not
on
this
side
then
will
you
step
out
coates
keeping
carefully
to
the
paths
and
proceed
as
far
as
the
particularly
note
if
the
beds
have
been
disturbed
between
the
hedge
and
the
path
but
do
make
any
marks
yourself
you
are
looking
for
you
understand
spoor
very
good
sir
of
big
game
of
big
game

coates
unmoved
by
the
strangeness
of
his
instructions
coates
an
for
those
who
decry
the
excellence
of
british
army
disciplinary
methods
departed
it
was
with
not
a
little
curiosity
and
interest
that
i
awaited
his
report
as
i
sat
sipping
my
tea
i
could
hear
his
regular
tread
as
he
passed
along
the
garden
path
outside
the
window
then
it
ceased
and
was
followed
by
a
vague
muttering
he
had
found
something
all
traces
of
the
storm
had
disappeared
and
there
was
every
indication
of
a
renewal
of
the
but
i
knew
that
the
wet
soil
would
have
preserved
a
perfect
impression
of
any
imprint
made
upon
it
on
the
previous
night
nevertheless
with
the
early
morning
sun
streaming
into
my
window
out
of
a
sky
as
near
to
turquoise
as
i
had
ever
seen
it
in
england
i
found
it
impossible
to
recapture
that
uncanny
thrill
which
had
come
to
me
in
the
dark
hours
when
out
of
the
shadows
under
the
hedge
the
great
cat
eyes
had
looked
up
at
me
and
now
becoming
more
fully
awake
i
remembered
something
else
which
hitherto
i
had
not
associated
with
the
latter
phenomenon
i
remembered
that
lithe
and
evasive
pursuing
shape
which
i
had
detected
behind
me
on
the
road
even
now
however
it
was
difficult
to
associate
one
with
the
other
for
whereas
the
figure
had
resembled
that
of
a
man
or
more
closely
that
of
a
woman
the
eyes
had
looked
out
upon
me
from
a
point
low
down
near
the
ground
like
those
of
some
crouching
feline
coates
footsteps
sounded
again
upon
the
path
and
i
heard
him
walking
round
the
cottage
and
through
the
kitchen
finally
he
reëntered
the
bedroom
and
stood
just
within
the
doorway
in
that
attitude
of
attention
which
was
part
and
parcel
of
the
man
his
appearance
would
doubtless
have
violated
the
proprieties
of
the
albany
for
in
my
rural
retreat
he
was
called
upon
to
perform
other
and
more
important
services
than
those
of
a
valet
his
neatly
shaved
chin
stolid
red
countenance
and
perfectly
brushed
hair
were
unexceptionable
of
course
but
because
his
duties
would
presently
take
him
into
the
garden
he
wore
not
the
regulation
black
but
an
ancient
khaki
breeches
and
brown
gaiters
looking
every
inch
of
him
the
old
soldier
that
he
was
well
coates
said
i
he
cleared
his
throat
there
are
footprints
in
the
sir
he
reported
footprints
yes
sir
very
deep
as
though
some
one
had
jumped
over
the
hedge
and
landed
there
jumped
over
the
hedge
i
exclaimed
that
would
be
a
considerable
jump
coates
from
the
road
it
would
sir
maybe
she
scrambled
up
she
coates
cleared
his
throat
again
there
are
three
sets
of
prints
in
all
first
a
very
deep
one
where
the
party
had
landed
then
another
broken
up
like
where
she
had
turned
round
and
the
third
set
with
the
very
deep
where
she
had
sprung
back
over
the
hedge
she
i
shouted
the
prints
sir
resumed
coates
unmoved
are
those
of
a
shoes
i
sat
bolt
upright
in
bed
staring
at
the
man
and
scarcely
able
to
credit
my
senses
words
failed
me
whereupon
will
you
have
tea
or
coffee
for
breakfast
inquired
coates
tea
or
coffee
be
damned
coates
i
cried
i
going
out
to
look
at
those
footprints
if
you
had
seen
what
i
saw
last
night
even
your
old
mahogany
countenance
would
relax
for
once
i
assure
you
indeed
sir
said
coates
did
you
see
the
lady
then
lady
i
exclaimed
tumbling
out
of
bed
if
the
eyes
that
looked
at
me
last
night
belonged
to
a
either
i
am
mad
or
the
is
of
another
world
i
pulled
on
a
and
hurried
out
into
the
garden
coates
showing
me
the
spot
where
he
had
found
the
mysterious
a
very
brief
examination
sufficed
to
convince
me
that
his
account
had
been
correct
some
one
wearing
shoes
clearly
enough
had
stood
there
at
some
time
whilst
the
soil
was
quite
wet
and
as
no
track
led
to
or
from
the
marks
coates
conclusion
that
the
person
who
had
made
them
must
have
come
over
the
hedge
was
the
only
feasible
one
i
turned
to
him
in
amazement
but
recognizing
in
time
the
wildly
fantastic
nature
of
the
sight
which
i
had
seen
in
the
night
i
refrained
from
speaking
of
the
blazing
eyes
and
made
my
way
to
the
bathroom
wondering
if
some
chance
reflection
might
not
have
deceived
me
and
the
presence
of
a
woman
footmarks
at
the
same
spot
be
no
more
than
a
singular
coincidence
even
so
the
mystery
of
their
presence
there
remained
unexplained
my
thoughts
were
diverted
from
a
trend
of
profitless
conjecture
when
shortly
after
breakfast
time
my
bell
rang
it
was
the
editor
of
the
to
whom
i
had
been
indebted
for
a
number
of
special
commissions
including
my
fascinating
quest
of
the
giant
gnu
which
generally
supposed
to
be
extinct
was
reported
by
certain
natives
and
others
to
survive
in
a
remote
corner
of
the
dark
continent
readers
of
the
will
remember
that
although
i
failed
to
discover
the
gnu
i
came
upon
a
number
of
notable
things
on
my
journey
through
the
almost
unexplored
country
about
the
of
the
niger
a
most
extraordinary
case
has
cropped
up
he
said
quite
in
your
line
i
think
addison
evidently
a
murder
and
the
circumstances
seem
to
be
most
dramatic
and
unusual
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
take
it
up
i
inquired
without
much
enthusiasm
for
details
criminology
was
one
of
my
hobbies
and
in
several
instances
i
had
traced
cases
of
alleged
haunting
and
other
supposedly
supernatural
happenings
to
a
criminal
source
but
the
ordinary
sordid
murder
did
not
interest
me
the
body
of
sir
marcus
coverly
has
been
found
in
a
crate
explained
my
friend
the
crate
was
being
lowered
into
the
hold
of
the
at
the
west
india
docks
it
had
been
delivered
by
a
conveyance
specially
hired
for
the
purpose
apparently
as
the
is
due
to
sail
in
an
hour
there
are
all
sorts
of
curious
details
but
these
you
can
learn
for
yourself
do
trouble
to
call
at
the
office
proceed
straight
to
the
dock
right
i
said
shortly
i
start
immediately
and
this
sudden
decision
had
been
brought
about
by
the
mention
of
the
victim
name
indeed
as
i
replaced
the
receiver
on
the
hook
i
observed
that
my
hand
was
shaking
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
i
had
grown
pale
in
the
first
place
then
let
me
confess
that
my
retirement
to
the
odd
little
retreat
which
at
this
time
was
my
home
and
my
absorption
in
the
obscure
studies
to
which
i
have
referred
were
not
so
much
due
to
any
natural
liking
for
the
life
of
a
recluse
as
to
the
shattering
of
certain
matrimonial
designs
i
had
learned
of
the
wreck
of
my
hopes
upon
reading
a
press
paragraph
which
announced
the
engagement
of
isobel
merlin
to
eric
coverly
and
it
was
as
much
to
conceal
my
disappointment
from
the
world
as
for
any
better
reason
that
i
had
slunk
into
retirement
for
if
i
am
slow
to
come
to
a
decision
in
such
a
matter
once
come
to
it
is
of
no
light
moment
yet
although
i
had
breathed
no
word
of
my
lost
dreams
to
isobel
but
had
congratulated
her
with
the
rest
often
and
bitterly
i
had
cursed
myself
for
a
sluggard
too
late
i
had
learned
that
she
had
but
awaited
a
word
from
me
and
i
had
gone
off
to
mesopotamia
leaving
that
word
unspoken
during
my
absence
coverly
had
won
the
prize
which
i
had
thrown
away
he
was
heir
to
the
title
for
his
cousin
sir
marcus
was
unmarried
now
here
a
bolt
from
the
blue
came
the
news
of
his
cousin
death
it
can
well
be
imagined
with
what
intense
excitement
i
hurried
to
the
docks
all
other
plans
abandoned
coates
arrayed
in
his
neat
blue
uniform
ran
the
rover
round
from
the
garage
and
ere
long
we
were
jolting
along
the
hideously
uneven
commercial
road
east
dodging
drawing
strings
of
lorries
and
continually
meeting
delay
in
the
form
of
those
breakdowns
which
are
of
hourly
occurrence
in
this
congested
but
rugged
highway
in
the
west
india
dock
road
the
way
became
slightly
more
open
but
when
at
last
i
alighted
and
entered
the
dock
gates
i
recognized
that
every
newspaper
and
news
agency
in
the
kingdom
was
apparently
represented
jones
of
the
was
coming
out
as
i
went
in
and
hello
addison
he
cried
this
is
quite
in
your
line
it
as
mad
as
in
wonderland
i
did
not
delay
however
but
hurried
on
in
the
direction
of
a
dock
building
at
the
door
of
which
was
gathered
a
heterogeneous
group
comprising
newspaper
men
dock
officials
police
and
others
who
were
unclassifiable
half
a
dozen
acquaintances
greeted
me
as
i
came
up
and
i
saw
that
the
door
was
closed
and
that
a
constable
stood
on
duty
before
it
i
call
it
damned
impudence
addison
exclaimed
one
pressman
the
dock
people
are
refusing
everybody
information
until
inspector
arrives
from
new
scotland
yard
i
should
think
he
has
stopped
on
the
way
to
get
his
lunch
the
speaker
glanced
impatiently
at
his
watch
and
i
went
to
speak
to
the
man
on
duty
you
have
orders
to
admit
no
one
constable
i
asked
that
so
sir
he
replied
we
waiting
for
gatton
who
has
been
put
in
charge
of
the
case
ah
gatton
i
muttered
and
stepping
aside
from
the
expectant
group
i
filled
and
lighted
my
pipe
convinced
that
anything
to
be
learned
i
should
learn
from
inspector
gatton
for
he
and
i
were
old
friends
having
been
mutually
concerned
in
several
interesting
cases
a
few
minutes
later
the
inspector
arrived
a
very
bronzed
man
his
dark
hair
streaked
with
gray
and
with
all
the
appearance
of
a
retired
naval
officer
in
his
blue
serge
suit
and
soft
felt
hat
a
very
reserved
man
whose
blue
eyes
gave
him
that
frank
and
open
expression
which
is
more
often
associated
with
a
seaman
than
with
a
detective
he
nodded
to
several
acquaintances
in
the
group
and
then
observing
me
where
i
stood
came
over
and
shook
hands
open
the
door
constable
he
ordered
quietly
the
constable
produced
a
key
and
unlocked
the
door
of
the
small
stone
building
immediately
there
was
a
forward
movement
of
the
whole
waiting
group
but
if
you
please
gentlemen
said
gatton
raising
his
hand
i
must
make
my
examination
first
and
addison
he
added
seeing
the
resentment
written
upon
the
faces
of
my
disappointed
confrères
has
special
information
which
i
am
going
to
ask
him
to
place
at
my
disposal
the
constable
stood
aside
and
i
followed
inspector
gatton
into
the
stone
shed
lock
the
door
again
constable
he
ordered
no
one
is
to
be
admitted
thereupon
i
looked
about
me
and
the
scene
which
i
beheld
was
so
strange
and
gruesome
that
its
every
detail
remains
imprinted
upon
my
memory
the
building
then
was
lighted
by
four
barred
windows
set
so
high
in
the
walls
that
no
one
could
look
in
from
the
outside
blazing
sunlight
poured
in
at
the
two
southerly
windows
and
drew
a
sharp
black
pattern
of
the
bars
across
the
paved
floor
kneeling
beside
a
stretcher
fully
in
this
path
of
light
so
that
he
presented
a
curious
striped
appearance
was
a
man
who
presently
proved
to
be
the
divisional
surgeon
and
two
paces
beyond
stood
a
police
inspector
who
was
engaged
at
the
moment
of
our
entrance
in
making
entries
in
his
on
the
stretcher
so
covered
up
that
only
his
face
was
visible
lay
one
whom
at
first
i
failed
to
recognize
for
the
horribly
contorted
features
presented
a
kind
of
mottled
green
appearance
utterly
indescribable
stifling
an
exclamation
of
horror
i
stared
and
stared
at
that
ghastly
face
then
my
god
i
muttered
yes
it
sir
marcus
the
surgeon
stood
up
and
the
inspector
advanced
to
meet
gatton
but
my
horrified
gaze
had
strayed
from
the
stretcher
to
a
badly
damaged
and
splintered
which
was
the
only
other
object
in
the
otherwise
empty
shed
at
this
i
stared
as
much
aghast
as
i
had
stared
at
the
dead
man
the
iron
bands
were
broken
and
twisted
and
the
whole
of
one
side
lay
in
fragments
on
the
floor
but
upon
a
board
which
had
formed
part
of
the
top
i
perceived
the
figure
of
a
cat
roughly
traced
in
green
paint
beyond
any
shadow
of
doubt
this
crate
was
the
same
which
on
the
night
before
had
lain
in
the
garage
of
the
red
house
chapter
iii
the
green
image
yes
said
gatton
i
was
speaking
no
more
than
the
truth
when
i
told
them
that
you
had
special
information
which
i
hoped
you
would
place
at
my
disposal
some
of
the
particulars
were
given
to
me
over
the
you
see
and
i
was
glad
to
find
you
here
when
i
arrived
i
should
have
consulted
you
in
any
event
and
principally
about
that
he
pointed
to
an
object
which
i
held
in
my
hand
it
was
a
little
green
enamel
image
the
crouching
figure
of
a
woman
having
a
cat
head
a
piece
of
egyptian
workmanship
probably
of
the
fourth
century
considered
in
conjunction
with
the
figure
painted
upon
the
crate
the
presence
of
this
little
image
was
so
amazing
a
circumstance
that
from
the
moment
when
it
had
been
placed
in
my
hand
i
had
stood
staring
at
it
almost
dazedly
the
divisional
surgeon
had
gone
and
only
the
local
officer
remained
with
gatton
and
myself
in
the
building
sir
marcus
coverly
presented
all
the
frightful
appearance
of
one
who
has
died
by
asphyxia
and
although
of
course
there
would
be
an
autopsy
little
doubt
existed
respecting
the
mode
of
his
death
the
marks
of
violence
found
upon
the
body
could
be
accounted
for
by
the
fact
that
the
crate
had
fallen
a
distance
of
thirty
feet
into
the
hold
and
the
surgeon
was
convinced
that
the
injuries
to
the
body
had
all
been
received
after
death
death
having
taken
place
in
his
opinion
fully
twelve
hours
before
you
see
said
gatton
when
the
crate
broke
several
things
which
presumably
were
in
sir
marcus
pockets
were
found
lying
loose
amongst
the
wreckage
that
was
one
of
them
yet
it
may
not
have
been
in
any
of
his
pockets
at
all
said
i
it
not
agreed
gatton
but
that
it
was
somewhere
in
the
crate
is
beyond
dispute
i
think
besides
this
is
more
than
a
coincidence
and
he
pointed
to
the
painted
cat
upon
the
lid
of
the
i
had
already
told
him
of
the
episode
at
the
red
house
on
the
previous
night
and
now
the
fates
are
on
our
side
i
said
for
at
least
we
know
where
the
crate
was
despatched
from
quite
so
agreed
gatton
we
should
have
got
that
from
the
carter
later
of
course
but
every
minute
saved
in
an
affair
such
as
this
is
worth
considering
as
a
pressman
you
will
probably
disagree
with
me
but
i
propose
to
suppress
these
two
pieces
of
evidence
premature
publication
of
clews
too
often
handicaps
us
now
what
that
figure
exactly
it
is
a
votive
offering
of
a
kind
used
in
ancient
egypt
by
pilgrims
to
bubastis
it
is
a
genuine
antique
and
if
you
think
the
history
of
such
relics
is
likely
to
assist
the
investigation
i
can
give
you
some
further
particulars
this
evening
if
you
have
time
to
call
at
my
place
i
think
said
gatton
taking
the
figure
from
me
and
looking
at
it
with
a
singular
expression
on
his
face
that
the
history
of
the
thing
is
very
important
the
fact
that
a
rough
reproduction
of
a
somewhat
similar
figure
is
painted
upon
the
case
can
not
possibly
be
a
coincidence
i
stared
at
him
silently
for
a
moment
then
you
mean
that
the
crate
was
specially
designed
to
contain
the
body
i
asked
i
am
certainly
of
that
opinion
declared
inspector
heath
the
local
officer
it
is
of
just
the
right
size
and
shape
for
the
purpose
once
more
i
began
to
examine
the
fragments
stacked
upon
the
floor
and
then
i
looked
again
at
the
several
objects
which
lay
beside
the
crate
they
were
the
personal
belongings
of
the
dead
baronet
and
the
police
had
carefully
noted
in
which
of
his
pockets
each
object
had
been
found
he
was
in
evening
dress
and
a
light
had
been
packed
into
the
crate
beside
him
in
this
had
been
found
a
and
a
pair
of
gloves
a
wallet
containing
in
treasury
notes
and
a
number
of
cards
and
personal
papers
had
fallen
out
of
the
crate
together
with
the
cat
statuette
the
face
of
his
watch
was
broken
it
had
been
in
his
waistcoat
pocket
but
it
still
ticked
steadily
on
where
it
lay
there
beside
its
dead
owner
a
malacca
cane
also
figured
amongst
the
relics
of
the
gruesome
crime
so
that
whatever
had
been
the
object
of
the
murderer
that
of
robbery
was
out
of
the
question
the
next
thing
to
do
said
gatton
is
to
trace
sir
movements
from
the
time
that
he
left
home
last
night
to
the
time
that
he
met
his
death
i
am
going
out
now
to
to
the
yard
we
ought
to
have
succeeded
in
tracing
the
carter
who
brought
the
crate
here
before
the
evening
i
personally
shall
proceed
to
sir
marcus
rooms
and
then
to
this
red
house
around
which
it
seems
to
me
that
the
mystery
centers
he
put
the
enamel
figure
into
his
pocket
and
taking
up
the
broken
board
which
bore
the
painted
cat
you
are
carrying
a
he
said
hide
this
under
it
he
turned
to
inspector
heath
nodding
shortly
all
right
he
said
with
a
grim
smile
go
out
now
and
talk
to
the
crowd
having
issued
certain
telephonic
instructions
touching
the
carter
who
had
delivered
the
crate
to
the
docks
and
then
imparting
to
the
representatives
of
the
press
a
guarded
statement
for
publication
inspector
gatton
succeeded
in
wedging
himself
into
my
little
and
ere
long
we
were
lurching
and
bumping
along
the
streets
the
late
sir
marcus
london
address
which
had
been
unknown
to
me
we
had
learned
from
his
cards
and
it
was
with
the
keenest
anticipation
of
a
notable
discovery
that
i
presently
found
myself
with
gatton
mounting
the
stairs
to
the
chambers
of
the
murdered
baronet
at
the
very
moment
of
our
arrival
the
door
was
opened
and
a
man
quite
obviously
a
constable
in
plain
clothes
came
out
behind
him
i
observed
one
whom
i
took
to
be
the
late
sir
marcus
servant
a
pathetic
and
somewhat
disheveled
figure
hello
blythe
said
gatton
who
instructed
you
to
come
here
sir
marcus
man
morris
telephoned
the
yard
was
the
reply
as
he
could
understand
what
had
become
of
his
master
and
i
was
sent
along
to
see
him
oh
said
gatton
very
good
report
to
me
in
due
course
blythe
departed
and
gatton
and
i
entered
the
hall
the
man
morris
closed
the
door
and
led
us
into
a
small
library
beside
the
telephone
stood
a
tray
bearing
decanter
and
glasses
and
there
was
evidence
that
morris
had
partaken
of
a
hurried
breakfast
consisting
only
of
biscuits
and
whisky
and
soda
i
have
been
to
bed
all
night
gentlemen
he
began
the
moment
that
we
entered
the
room
sir
marcus
was
a
good
master
and
if
he
was
sleeping
away
from
home
he
never
failed
to
advise
me
so
that
i
knew
even
before
the
dreadful
news
reached
me
that
something
was
amiss
he
was
quite
unstrung
and
his
voice
was
unsteady
the
reputation
of
the
late
baronet
had
been
one
which
i
personally
did
not
envy
him
but
whatever
his
faults
and
i
knew
they
had
been
many
he
had
evidently
possessed
the
redeeming
virtue
of
being
a
good
employer
a
couple
of
hours
sleep
would
make
a
new
man
of
you
said
gatton
kindly
i
understand
your
feelings
but
no
amount
of
sorrow
can
mend
matters
unfortunately
now
i
do
want
to
worry
you
but
there
are
one
or
two
points
which
i
must
ask
you
to
clear
up
in
the
first
place
did
you
ever
see
this
before
from
his
pocket
he
took
out
the
little
figure
of
bâst
the
and
held
it
up
before
morris
the
man
stared
at
it
with
eyes
scratching
his
unshaven
chin
then
he
shook
his
head
slowly
never
he
declared
no
i
am
positive
i
never
saw
a
figure
like
that
before
then
secondly
continued
gatton
was
your
master
ever
in
egypt
not
that
i
am
aware
of
certainly
not
since
i
have
been
with
him
six
years
on
the
of
this
month
ah
said
gatton
now
when
did
you
last
see
sir
marcus
at
six
last
night
sir
he
was
dining
at
his
club
and
then
going
to
the
new
avenue
theater
i
booked
a
seat
for
him
myself
he
was
going
alone
then
yes
gatton
glanced
at
me
significantly
and
i
experienced
an
uncomfortable
thrill
in
the
inspector
glance
i
had
read
that
he
suspected
the
presence
of
a
woman
in
the
case
and
at
the
mention
of
the
new
avenue
theater
it
had
instantly
occurred
to
me
that
isobel
merlin
was
appearing
there
gatton
turned
again
to
morris
sir
marcus
had
not
led
you
to
suppose
that
there
was
any
likelihood
of
his
returning
last
night
no
sir
that
was
why
knowing
his
regular
custom
i
became
so
alarmed
when
he
failed
to
come
back
or
to
gatton
stared
hard
at
the
speaker
and
it
will
be
no
breach
of
confidence
on
your
part
he
said
speaking
slowly
and
deliberately
for
you
to
answer
my
next
question
the
best
service
you
can
do
your
late
master
now
will
be
to
help
us
to
apprehend
his
murderer
he
paused
a
moment
then
was
sir
marcus
interested
in
some
one
engaged
at
the
new
avenue
theater
he
asked
morris
glanced
from
face
to
face
in
a
pathetic
troubled
fashion
he
rubbed
the
stubble
on
his
chin
again
and
hesitated
finally
i
believe
he
replied
that
there
was
a
lady
there
who
he
paused
swallowing
and
yes
gatton
prompted
who
who
interested
sir
marcus
but
i
do
know
her
name
nor
anything
about
her
he
declared
i
knew
about
some
of
the
others
but
sir
marcus
was
very
reserved
about
this
lady
which
made
me
think
yes
that
he
perhaps
had
been
so
successful
morris
ceased
speaking
and
sat
staring
at
a
bookcase
vacantly
ah
murmured
gatton
then
abruptly
did
sir
marcus
ever
visit
any
one
who
lived
in
college
road
he
demanded
morris
looked
up
wearily
college
road
he
repeated
where
is
that
sir
it
does
matter
said
gatton
shortly
if
the
name
is
unfamiliar
to
you
had
sir
marcus
a
car
not
latterly
sir
any
other
servants
no
as
a
bachelor
he
had
no
use
for
a
large
establishment
and
friars
park
remains
in
the
possession
of
the
late
sir
widow
sir
burnham
sir
marcus
uncle
yes
what
living
relatives
had
sir
marcus
his
aunt
lady
burnham
coverly
with
whom
i
believe
he
was
on
bad
terms
her
own
son
who
ought
to
have
inherited
the
title
was
dead
you
see
i
think
she
felt
bitterly
towards
my
master
the
only
other
relative
i
ever
heard
of
was
eric
sir
marcus
second
cousin
now
eric
of
course
i
turned
aside
glancing
at
some
books
which
lay
scattered
on
the
table
the
wound
was
a
new
one
and
i
suppose
i
was
not
man
enough
to
hide
the
pain
which
mention
of
eric
coverly
still
occasioned
me
were
the
cousins
good
friends
continued
the
even
remorseless
voice
of
the
inquisitor
morris
looked
up
quickly
they
were
not
sir
he
answered
they
never
had
been
but
some
few
months
back
a
fresh
quarrel
arose
and
one
night
in
this
very
room
it
almost
came
to
blows
indeed
what
was
the
quarrel
about
the
old
hesitancy
claimed
morris
again
but
at
last
of
course
he
said
with
visible
embarrassment
it
was
a
woman
i
felt
my
heart
leaping
wildly
but
i
managed
to
preserve
an
outward
show
of
composure
what
woman
demanded
gatton
i
do
know
sir
do
you
mean
it
a
fierce
note
of
challenge
had
come
into
the
quiet
voice
but
morris
looked
up
and
met
gatton
searching
stare
unflinchingly
i
swear
it
he
said
i
never
was
an
eavesdropper
i
suggest
it
was
the
same
woman
that
sir
marcus
went
to
see
last
night
gatton
continued
the
examination
of
morris
had
reached
a
point
at
which
i
found
myself
hard
put
to
it
to
retain
even
a
seeming
of
composure
all
questions
had
been
leading
up
to
this
suggestion
as
i
now
perceived
clearly
enough
and
from
the
cousins
quarrel
to
isobel
who
was
engaged
at
the
new
avenue
theater
was
an
inevitable
step
but
possibly
sir
was
morris
only
answer
inspector
gatton
stared
hard
at
the
man
for
a
moment
or
so
then
very
well
he
said
take
my
advice
and
turn
in
there
will
be
much
for
you
to
do
presently
i
am
afraid
who
was
sir
marcus
solicitor
morris
gave
the
desired
information
in
a
tired
toneless
voice
and
we
departed
little
did
gatton
realize
that
his
words
were
barbed
when
as
we
descended
to
the
street
he
said
i
have
a
call
to
make
at
scotland
yard
next
after
which
my
first
visit
will
be
to
the
of
the
new
avenue
theater
can
i
be
of
further
assistance
to
you
at
the
moment
i
asked
endeavoring
to
speak
casually
thanks
no
but
i
should
welcome
your
company
this
afternoon
at
my
examination
of
the
red
house
i
understand
that
it
is
in
your
neighborhood
so
perhaps
as
you
are
also
professionally
interested
in
the
case
you
might
arrange
to
meet
me
there
are
you
returning
home
now
or
going
to
the
office
i
think
to
the
office
i
replied
in
any
event
there
making
an
appointment
and
i
will
meet
you
at
the
red
house
chapter
iv
isobel
ten
minutes
later
i
was
standing
in
a
charming
little
boudoir
which
too
often
figured
in
my
daydreams
my
own
photograph
was
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
in
isobel
dark
eyes
when
she
greeted
me
there
was
a
light
which
i
lacked
the
courage
to
try
to
understand
i
had
not
at
that
time
learned
what
i
learned
later
and
have
already
indicated
that
my
own
foolish
silence
had
wounded
isobel
as
deeply
as
her
subsequent
engagement
to
eric
coverly
had
wounded
me
the
psychology
of
a
woman
is
intriguing
in
its
very
naïveté
and
now
as
she
stood
before
me
slim
and
graceful
in
her
walking
costume
a
quick
flicker
of
red
flaming
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
alight
with
that
sweet
tantalizing
look
in
which
expectation
and
a
hot
pride
were
mingled
i
wondered
and
felt
sick
at
heart
desirable
she
was
beyond
any
other
woman
i
had
known
and
i
called
myself
witling
coward
to
have
avoided
putting
my
fortune
to
the
test
on
that
fatal
day
of
my
departure
for
mesopotamia
for
just
as
she
looked
at
me
now
she
had
looked
at
me
then
but
she
was
evidently
on
the
point
of
setting
out
i
did
not
doubt
with
the
purpose
of
meeting
eric
coverly
on
that
day
of
the
irrevocable
past
she
had
been
free
and
i
had
been
silent
you
nearly
missed
me
jack
she
said
gayly
i
was
just
going
out
by
the
very
of
her
greeting
she
restored
me
to
myself
and
enabled
me
to
stamp
down
at
least
temporarily
the
monster
through
whose
greedy
eyes
i
had
found
myself
considering
the
happiness
of
eric
coverly
i
am
afraid
isobel
i
replied
that
what
i
have
to
tell
you
is
not
by
any
means
pleasant
although
yes
she
prompted
noting
how
i
hesitated
although
it
means
that
you
are
now
the
future
lady
coverly
the
bright
color
left
her
cheeks
that
some
black
tragedy
underlay
my
words
she
had
intuitively
perceived
but
i
could
see
that
she
failed
to
grasp
the
whole
meaning
of
my
bald
statement
she
sank
down
slowly
into
a
cushioned
chair
so
that
a
beam
of
golden
light
pouring
in
through
the
opened
window
set
aglowing
the
russet
tints
in
her
dark
brown
hair
did
you
know
sir
marcus
i
asked
speaking
as
gently
as
i
could
with
what
intense
if
hidden
emotion
i
awaited
her
answer
it
were
impossible
to
describe
do
you
mean
she
met
my
glance
and
i
nodded
gravely
oh
jack
when
did
it
happen
last
night
but
you
have
not
told
me
if
you
knew
him
i
persisted
isobel
shook
her
head
not
in
any
way
intimately
she
replied
eric
she
hesitated
glancing
up
quickly
and
as
quickly
down
again
and
he
were
not
on
good
terms
but
you
had
met
him
i
persisted
for
i
had
detected
in
her
manner
a
reluctance
to
discuss
sir
marcus
which
i
failed
to
understand
i
used
to
meet
him
jack
when
when
you
were
away
he
came
once
or
twice
with
eric
they
were
not
good
friends
even
then
but
i
never
liked
him
i
quite
lost
sight
of
him
from
the
time
that
he
came
into
the
title
about
four
years
ago
was
it
not
until
quite
recently
he
had
been
in
russia
i
think
then
he
again
she
hesitated
it
was
odd
how
often
people
hesitated
as
if
seeking
for
words
when
speaking
of
the
late
baronet
he
called
at
the
theater
considering
that
he
knew
of
my
engagement
to
eric
his
manner
was
not
quite
nice
but
i
was
anxious
to
prevent
trouble
and
did
not
mention
the
visit
to
eric
sir
marcus
was
very
persistent
however
one
night
eric
saw
him
leaving
the
and
i
believe
there
was
a
dreadful
scene
at
eric
rooms
and
that
is
all
you
know
of
him
isobel
practically
all
except
what
i
have
heard
of
course
i
might
add
that
i
instructed
marie
to
tell
sir
marcus
i
was
engaged
whenever
he
might
call
in
future
and
did
he
call
again
marie
said
that
he
sent
his
card
up
on
several
occasions
but
she
knew
how
the
affair
worried
me
and
did
not
tell
me
at
the
time
i
saw
him
in
the
stalls
occasionally
and
oh
the
last
word
was
a
mere
murmur
isobel
expression
grew
more
than
ever
troubled
he
was
there
last
night
she
whispered
and
raising
her
eyes
to
me
tell
me
how
it
happened
and
where
but
ere
i
had
time
to
begin
there
was
an
interruption
dimly
a
telephone
bell
rang
i
could
hear
the
voice
of
marie
isobel
maid
answering
the
call
then
coverly
to
speak
to
you
madam
said
marie
entering
the
room
he
must
have
only
just
heard
the
news
cried
isobel
rising
swiftly
and
going
out
consumed
by
impatience
i
walked
up
and
down
the
dainty
apartment
listening
to
isobel
muffled
voice
speaking
in
the
lobby
twice
i
went
to
the
window
and
peered
down
into
the
street
expecting
to
see
the
figure
of
inspector
gatton
approaching
my
frame
of
mind
was
peculiar
and
troubled
gatton
inquiries
pointed
unmistakably
to
a
suspicion
that
sir
marcus
last
hours
had
been
spent
if
not
actually
with
at
any
rate
near
to
isobel
and
since
the
man
who
would
most
directly
profit
by
the
baronet
death
happened
also
to
be
isobel
i
foresaw
a
dreadful
ordeal
for
both
if
eric
coverly
was
not
in
a
position
to
establish
an
alibi
i
had
been
about
to
ask
her
if
coverly
had
been
in
her
company
on
the
previous
night
when
the
interruption
had
occurred
now
if
gatton
should
arrive
and
find
me
in
isobel
flat
what
construction
would
he
put
upon
my
presence
yet
again
i
went
to
the
window
and
peered
anxiously
up
and
down
the
street
every
cab
that
approached
i
expected
to
contain
the
inspector
and
i
heaved
a
sigh
of
relief
as
one
after
another
passed
the
door
pedestrians
who
turned
the
distant
corner
i
scrutinized
closely
and
was
so
employed
when
isobel
came
running
back
to
the
room
all
her
color
had
fled
and
her
eyes
were
wide
and
oh
jack
jack
she
cried
it
is
horrible
horrible
eric
is
at
his
solicitors
and
they
tell
him
that
suspicion
is
bound
to
fall
on
it
preposterous
unthinkable
it
must
have
been
some
fiend
who
committed
such
a
crime
not
a
human
being
then
i
interrupted
excitedly
coverly
was
not
with
you
last
night
no
that
is
the
crowning
tragedy
of
it
all
he
me
early
in
the
evening
saying
that
he
had
an
unavoidable
business
appointment
to
keep
from
the
tone
of
his
voice
she
ceased
speaking
abruptly
and
stared
at
me
rather
wildly
isobel
i
said
you
should
surely
know
that
you
can
trust
your
life
to
me
and
the
life
of
any
one
dear
to
you
she
quickly
laid
her
hand
on
my
arm
and
her
face
flushed
sweetly
i
fear
i
had
infused
my
words
with
an
ardor
which
exhibited
at
an
earlier
and
more
opportune
moment
might
have
changed
the
course
of
both
our
lives
of
course
i
know
jack
she
said
but
i
am
so
frightened
that
i
distrust
my
very
self
well
then
i
thought
that
i
noticed
a
change
in
eric
manner
last
night
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
in
fact
i
asked
him
if
i
had
done
anything
of
which
he
had
disapproved
she
gave
me
a
quick
little
embarrassed
glance
he
is
somewhat
exacting
you
know
he
laughed
at
the
idea
but
in
rather
a
forced
way
it
seemed
then
he
arranged
to
meet
me
for
lunch
at
the
carlton
but
surely
he
can
satisfactorily
account
for
his
movements
he
must
have
been
seen
by
those
who
know
him
isobel
frowned
in
a
troubled
manner
that
awakened
strange
wild
longings
i
can
not
make
it
out
she
replied
he
appears
to
be
keeping
something
back
he
is
very
he
will
certainly
have
to
make
up
his
mind
to
speak
out
when
inspector
gatton
examines
him
i
can
not
disguise
from
you
isobel
that
the
police
know
that
sir
marcus
was
at
the
new
avenue
last
night
and
since
his
death
occurred
some
hours
later
the
nature
of
their
suspicion
is
obvious
enough
are
you
joining
him
at
the
solicitors
isobel
yes
he
asked
me
to
do
so
then
come
along
at
once
i
expect
a
scotland
yard
man
to
arrive
at
any
moment
and
it
would
be
advisable
to
see
coverly
and
to
take
a
legal
opinion
before
you
give
your
testimony
but
jack
isobel
confronted
me
you
do
think
that
i
or
eric
have
anything
to
hide
certainly
not
you
must
know
that
i
do
not
think
so
but
on
the
other
hand
the
legal
mind
being
used
to
considering
problems
of
evidence
a
solicitor
will
be
able
to
advise
you
of
the
best
course
to
adopt
and
that
most
likely
to
result
in
your
being
spared
all
association
with
the
inquiry
meanwhile
let
us
hurry
i
prefer
to
give
inspector
gatton
my
own
account
of
this
visit
rather
than
to
be
discovered
here
by
him
he
will
learn
from
marie
that
i
have
called
of
course
but
that
does
matter
we
had
now
quitted
the
flat
and
were
descending
the
stairs
on
reaching
the
street
i
glanced
sharply
to
right
and
left
but
gatton
was
not
in
sight
i
secured
a
taxi
at
the
corner
and
isobel
set
out
for
the
office
of
coverly
solicitor
i
stood
looking
after
the
cab
until
it
was
out
of
sight
and
then
i
set
out
to
walk
to
the
office
by
the
time
that
i
had
reached
fleet
street
i
had
my
ideas
in
some
sort
of
order
and
i
sat
down
to
write
the
first
of
my
articles
on
the
mystery
for
under
that
title
the
murder
of
sir
marcus
coverly
was
destined
to
figure
as
the
of
the
moment
i
had
more
than
one
reason
for
reticence
and
indeed
i
experienced
no
little
difficulty
in
preparing
the
requisite
amount
of
copy
without
involving
isobel
and
eric
coverly
through
my
task
i
paused
laid
down
my
pen
and
was
on
the
point
of
tearing
up
the
pages
already
written
and
declining
the
commission
at
the
eleventh
hour
a
few
minutes
reflection
however
enabled
me
to
see
that
the
best
service
i
could
offer
to
the
suspected
man
always
assuming
that
he
had
no
alibi
to
offer
was
that
of
representing
the
facts
as
i
saw
them
to
the
vast
public
reached
by
this
influential
journal
in
my
own
mind
i
had
never
entertained
a
shadow
of
suspicion
that
coverly
was
the
culprit
underlying
the
horrible
case
i
thought
i
could
perceive
even
darker
things
a
mystery
within
a
mystery
a
horror
overtopping
horror
i
had
just
resumed
work
then
when
a
boy
came
in
to
inform
me
that
gatton
had
rung
up
and
wished
to
speak
to
me
half
fearful
of
what
i
should
hear
i
went
to
the
adjoining
room
and
took
up
the
receiver
presently
hullo
is
that
mr
addison
came
gatton
voice
yes
speaking
what
developments
gatton
several
i
got
the
report
of
the
and
i
seen
the
of
the
new
avenue
you
must
write
anything
until
i
see
you
but
in
order
to
regularize
things
a
bit
i
spoken
to
the
chief
and
formally
asked
his
permission
to
consult
you
on
the
case
about
the
egyptian
figures
you
know
he
remembered
you
at
once
so
it
all
square
but
i
got
a
bone
to
pick
with
you
what
is
that
never
mind
now
can
you
meet
me
at
the
red
house
at
five
yes
i
will
be
there
good
i
do
hope
for
much
it
the
strangest
case
i
ever
touched
we
are
dealing
with
unusual
people
not
ordinary
criminals
i
agree
if
there
is
any
man
in
london
who
can
see
daylight
through
the
mystery
i
believe
you
are
the
man
do
you
know
on
what
i
think
the
whole
thing
turns
on
some
undiscovered
incident
in
sir
marcus
past
beyond
a
doubt
probably
an
amorous
adventure
you
wrong
said
gatton
grimly
it
turns
on
the
figure
of
the
green
cat
five
chapter
v
the
interrupted
supper
i
arrived
at
the
red
house
before
inspector
gatton
a
constable
was
on
duty
at
the
gate
and
as
i
came
up
and
paused
he
regarded
me
rather
doubtfully
until
i
told
him
that
i
had
an
appointment
with
gatton
i
stared
up
the
drive
towards
the
house
it
was
not
apparently
a
very
old
building
presenting
some
of
the
worst
features
of
the
period
and
from
whence
it
derived
its
name
i
could
not
conjecture
unless
from
the
fact
that
the
greater
part
of
the
facade
was
overgrown
with
some
kind
of
red
creeper
the
formed
by
the
and
the
wall
bordering
the
road
was
filled
with
rather
unkempt
shrubbery
laurels
and
rhododendrons
for
the
most
part
from
amid
which
arose
several
big
trees
in
the
blaze
of
the
afternoon
sun
the
place
looked
commonplace
enough
with
estate
agents
bills
pasted
in
the
dirty
windows
and
it
was
difficult
to
conceive
that
it
had
been
the
scene
of
the
mysterious
crime
of
which
at
that
hour
all
london
was
talking
and
which
later
was
to
form
a
subject
of
debate
throughout
the
civilized
world
gatton
joined
me
within
a
few
minutes
of
my
arrival
he
was
accompanied
by
constable
bolton
with
whom
i
had
first
visited
the
red
house
bolton
was
now
in
plain
clothes
and
he
had
that
appearance
which
characterizes
the
constable
in
mufti
indeed
he
looked
rather
dazed
and
on
arriving
before
the
house
he
removed
his
bowler
and
mopped
his
red
face
with
a
large
handkerchief
nodding
to
me
as
he
did
so
good
afternoon
sir
it
was
lucky
you
came
along
with
me
last
night
i
thought
it
was
a
funny
go
and
i
was
right
it
seems
quite
right
said
gatton
shortly
and
now
here
are
the
keys
which
you
returned
to
the
depôt
this
morning
from
his
pocket
the
inspector
produced
a
steel
ring
bearing
a
large
and
a
small
key
which
i
recognized
as
that
which
had
hung
from
the
lock
of
the
garage
door
on
the
previous
night
we
walked
along
to
the
garage
and
inspector
gatton
placed
the
key
in
the
lock
then
turning
to
bolton
now
he
directed
show
us
exactly
what
you
did
bolton
replaced
his
bowler
which
hitherto
he
had
carried
in
his
hand
hesitated
for
a
moment
and
then
unlocked
the
door
of
course
i
had
my
lantern
with
me
last
night
he
explained
and
this
gentleman
and
myself
stood
looking
in
for
a
moment
addison
has
already
described
to
me
exactly
what
he
saw
said
gatton
show
us
what
you
did
after
addison
left
you
bolton
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
betokening
an
effort
of
retrospection
withdrew
the
key
from
the
lock
and
entered
the
garage
gatton
and
i
following
there
was
a
sky
window
to
light
the
place
so
that
when
bolton
reclosed
the
door
we
could
see
well
enough
his
movements
were
as
follows
relocking
the
door
from
the
inside
he
walked
slowly
along
to
a
smaller
door
at
the
opposite
end
and
with
the
other
key
attached
to
the
ring
unfastened
it
wait
a
moment
said
gatton
did
you
look
about
you
at
all
before
opening
this
door
only
long
enough
to
find
where
it
was
sir
just
about
as
long
as
i
showed
you
all
right
go
on
then
we
followed
bolton
out
into
a
very
narrow
path
evidently
a
tradesman
entrance
and
he
turned
and
locked
the
door
behind
him
slipping
the
keys
into
his
pocket
he
tramped
stolidly
out
to
the
main
road
whereon
we
emerged
immediately
beside
the
garage
ah
murmured
gatton
now
give
me
the
keys
and
as
the
man
did
so
throughout
all
this
time
did
you
see
or
hear
anything
of
an
unusual
nature
bolton
removed
his
bowler
once
more
i
had
gathered
by
this
time
that
he
regarded
fresh
air
as
an
aid
to
reflection
well
sir
he
replied
in
a
puzzled
way
that
first
door
well
said
gatton
as
the
man
hesitated
it
seemed
to
open
more
easily
just
now
than
it
did
last
night
there
seemed
to
be
a
sort
of
hitch
before
when
it
was
about
open
perhaps
the
crate
was
in
the
way
suggested
gatton
except
for
the
absence
of
the
crate
do
you
notice
anything
different
anything
missing
or
anything
there
now
that
was
not
there
before
bolton
shook
his
head
no
he
answered
it
looks
just
the
same
to
me
except
as
i
say
that
the
door
seemed
to
open
more
easily
h
muttered
gatton
and
you
carried
the
keys
in
your
pocket
until
you
went
off
duty
yes
sir
all
right
you
can
go
now
bolton
touched
his
bowler
and
departed
and
gatton
turned
to
me
with
a
grim
smile
we
just
step
inside
again
he
said
so
as
not
to
attract
any
undue
attention
he
again
unlocked
the
garage
door
and
closed
it
as
we
entered
now
said
he
before
we
go
any
further
what
was
your
idea
in
keeping
back
the
fact
that
one
of
the
missing
links
in
the
chain
of
evidence
was
already
in
your
possession
no
doubt
i
said
rather
guiltily
you
refer
to
the
fact
of
my
acquaintance
with
miss
isobel
merlin
i
do
said
gatton
and
to
the
fact
that
you
nipped
in
ahead
of
me
and
interviewed
this
important
witness
before
i
had
even
heard
of
her
existence
he
continued
to
smile
but
the
thoroughness
and
unflinching
pursuit
of
duty
which
were
the
outstanding
features
of
the
man
underlay
his
tone
of
badinage
i
want
to
say
he
continued
that
for
your
cooperation
which
has
been
very
useful
to
me
on
many
occasions
i
am
always
grateful
but
if
in
return
i
give
you
facilities
which
no
other
pressman
has
i
do
expect
you
to
abuse
them
really
inspector
i
replied
you
go
almost
too
far
i
have
done
nothing
to
prejudice
your
case
nor
could
i
possibly
have
known
until
my
interview
this
morning
with
miss
merlin
that
it
was
she
in
whom
the
late
sir
marcus
was
interested
h
said
gatton
but
still
rather
dubiously
his
frank
eyes
regarding
me
in
that
naïve
manner
which
was
so
deceptive
all
that
i
learned
i
continued
is
unequivocally
at
your
disposal
finally
i
may
tell
you
and
i
would
confess
it
to
few
men
that
miss
merlin
is
a
very
old
friend
and
might
have
been
something
more
if
i
had
not
been
a
fool
oh
said
gatton
and
his
expression
underwent
a
subtle
change
oh
that
rather
awkward
in
fact
he
frowned
perplexedly
it
damned
awkward
what
do
you
mean
i
demanded
well
said
he
i
do
know
what
account
miss
merlin
gave
to
you
of
her
relations
with
sir
marcus
relations
i
said
hotly
the
man
was
a
mere
acquaintance
she
had
even
seen
him
except
from
the
stage
for
some
months
past
oh
replied
gatton
is
that
so
he
looked
at
me
very
queerly
it
does
seem
to
dovetail
with
the
evidence
of
the
i
felt
myself
changing
color
and
what
then
does
the
assert
i
asked
gatton
continued
to
look
at
me
in
that
perplexed
way
and
believing
that
i
detected
the
trend
of
his
reflections
look
here
inspector
i
said
let
us
understand
one
another
whatever
may
be
the
evidence
of
and
others
upon
one
point
you
can
be
assured
miss
merlin
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
this
horrible
crime
the
idea
is
unthinkable
so
confident
am
i
of
this
that
you
can
be
perfectly
open
with
me
and
i
give
you
my
word
of
honor
that
i
shall
be
equally
frank
with
you
the
truth
of
the
matter
can
not
possibly
injure
her
in
the
end
and
i
am
as
anxious
to
discover
it
as
you
are
gatton
suddenly
extended
his
hand
and
good
he
said
we
understand
one
another
but
how
is
miss
merlin
going
to
explain
this
he
drew
a
from
his
pocket
turned
over
several
leaves
and
then
on
no
fewer
than
six
occasions
he
said
i
have
approximate
dates
here
sir
marcus
sent
his
card
to
miss
merlin
i
know
i
interrupted
him
he
persecuted
her
but
she
never
saw
him
wait
a
minute
last
night
gatton
glanced
at
me
sharply
marie
the
maid
came
down
after
sir
marcus
card
had
been
sent
to
the
and
talked
for
several
minutes
to
the
late
baronet
just
by
the
doorkeeper
box
but
out
of
earshot
that
was
at
ten
at
eleven
that
is
after
the
performance
sir
marcus
returned
and
again
marie
came
down
to
see
him
they
went
out
into
the
street
together
and
sir
marcus
entered
a
cab
which
was
waiting
and
drove
off
miss
merlin
left
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
our
glances
met
and
a
silence
of
some
moments
duration
fell
between
us
then
you
suggest
i
said
that
miss
merlin
had
arranged
a
rendezvous
with
him
and
to
save
appearances
had
joined
him
there
later
well
gatton
raised
his
eyebrows
what
do
suggest
i
found
myself
temporarily
at
a
loss
for
words
but
knowing
nothing
of
this
i
explained
naturally
i
was
not
in
a
position
to
tax
miss
merlin
with
it
possibly
you
have
done
so
what
is
her
explanation
i
have
not
seen
her
confessed
gatton
i
arrived
at
her
flat
ten
minutes
after
she
had
gone
out
with
you
you
saw
marie
unfortunately
marie
was
also
out
but
i
saw
an
old
charwoman
who
attends
daily
i
understand
and
it
was
from
her
that
i
learned
of
your
visit
marie
i
said
may
be
able
to
throw
some
light
on
the
matter
i
do
doubt
it
replied
gatton
grimly
meanwhile
we
have
sufficient
evidence
to
show
that
sir
marcus
drove
from
the
new
avenue
theater
to
this
house
he
may
not
have
driven
here
at
all
i
interrupted
he
may
have
driven
somewhere
else
and
performed
the
latter
part
of
his
journey
here
in
the
crate
cried
gatton
yes
you
are
right
his
body
may
actually
have
been
inside
the
crate
at
the
time
that
you
and
bolton
arrived
here
last
night
for
that
would
be
fully
an
hour
after
sir
marcus
left
the
but
who
can
have
rung
up
the
police
station
last
night
i
cried
and
what
can
have
been
the
object
of
this
unknown
person
that
we
have
to
find
out
said
gatton
quietly
undoubtedly
it
formed
part
of
a
scheme
planned
with
extraordinary
cunning
it
was
not
an
accident
or
an
oversight
i
mean
the
men
who
are
assisting
me
have
been
idle
for
we
have
already
learned
some
most
amazing
facts
about
the
case
i
have
yet
visited
the
house
myself
but
i
have
here
the
report
of
one
of
my
assistants
who
has
done
so
also
i
have
the
keys
the
garage
i
will
inspect
more
carefully
later
on
he
glanced
quickly
about
the
place
before
we
left
it
then
leaving
the
door
locked
behind
us
we
walked
along
to
the
gate
before
which
the
constable
stood
on
duty
and
from
thence
proceeded
up
the
drive
to
the
front
entrance
there
was
a
deep
porch
supported
by
pillars
and
densely
overgrown
with
creeper
i
noted
too
a
heavy
and
unhealthy
odor
as
of
decaying
leaves
and
observed
that
a
perfect
carpet
of
these
lay
on
the
path
in
the
shade
of
the
big
trees
it
was
comparatively
cool
but
the
heavy
malarious
smell
did
not
please
me
and
i
imagined
that
it
must
have
repelled
more
than
one
lessee
as
we
approached
the
porch
i
saw
that
the
windows
of
the
rooms
immediately
left
and
right
of
it
had
been
stripped
of
the
bills
for
i
could
see
where
fragments
of
paper
still
adhered
to
the
glass
there
were
no
bills
in
the
porch
either
but
when
gatton
opened
the
front
door
i
uttered
an
exclamation
of
surprise
we
stood
in
a
small
there
was
a
staircase
on
the
left
and
three
doors
opened
on
to
the
hall
but
although
the
red
house
was
palpably
unoccupied
the
hall
was
furnished
there
were
some
rugs
upon
the
polished
floor
a
heavy
bronze
in
front
of
the
grate
several
chairs
against
the
walls
and
a
large
palm
in
a
chinese
pot
why
i
exclaimed
the
place
is
furnished
and
the
stairs
are
carpeted
too
yes
said
gatton
looking
keenly
about
him
but
according
to
report
if
you
will
step
upstairs
you
will
get
a
surprise
what
do
you
mean
well
suppose
we
go
and
see
gatton
led
the
way
and
i
followed
up
the
stairs
as
far
as
the
first
landing
here
i
paused
in
amazement
for
at
this
point
all
attempts
at
furnishing
ceased
the
landing
was
quite
bare
and
so
were
the
stairs
above
it
seeing
my
expression
of
incredulous
surprise
yes
said
gatton
smiling
it
a
strange
arrangement
is
it
we
descended
again
to
the
furnished
hall
look
here
continued
my
companion
he
unlocked
a
door
on
the
left
having
tried
several
keys
from
the
bunch
which
he
carried
without
success
but
finally
discovering
the
right
one
a
long
rectangular
room
was
revealed
evidently
intended
for
a
it
was
empty
and
unfurnished
odds
and
ends
of
newspaper
and
other
rubbish
lying
here
and
there
upon
the
floor
my
astonishment
was
momentarily
increasing
a
second
door
that
in
the
center
gatton
opened
revealing
another
empty
room
but
i
have
reserved
this
one
for
the
last
he
said
you
will
find
that
it
is
unlocked
he
pointed
to
the
third
door
that
on
the
right
and
as
he
evidently
intended
me
to
open
it
i
stepped
forward
turned
the
handle
and
entered
a
small
square
room
exquisitely
furnished
a
heavy
persian
carpet
was
spread
upon
the
floor
and
the
windows
were
draped
with
some
kind
of
brightly
colored
madras
hung
upon
the
wall
there
was
a
quaint
cabinet
in
the
room
too
a
low
cushioned
settee
and
two
armchairs
in
the
center
was
a
table
upon
which
stood
a
lamp
with
a
large
mosaic
shade
two
chairs
were
set
to
the
table
and
the
table
was
laid
for
supper
a
bottle
of
wine
stood
in
an
in
which
the
ice
had
long
since
melted
and
a
tempting
cold
repast
was
spread
the
table
was
decorated
with
a
bowl
of
perfect
white
roses
the
silver
was
good
the
napery
was
snowy
like
a
fool
i
stood
gaping
at
the
spectacle
until
noting
the
direction
of
gatton
glance
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
mantelpiece
upon
which
a
clock
was
ticking
with
a
dull
and
solemn
note
standing
beside
the
clock
in
a
curious
carved
frame
was
a
large
photograph
of
isobel
chapter
vi
the
voice
this
is
where
the
mystery
centers
said
gatton
i
made
no
reply
for
i
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
of
that
discovery
in
the
deserted
supper
room
it
was
so
wholly
unexpected
and
yet
it
so
cruelly
confirmed
the
inspector
undisguised
suspicions
that
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
created
a
sort
of
impalpable
barrier
between
us
of
this
gatton
was
evidently
conscious
he
endeavored
to
arouse
my
interest
in
the
inquiries
which
he
was
conducting
in
the
garage
but
for
long
enough
i
saw
nothing
of
the
place
in
which
we
stood
i
could
only
see
that
photograph
smiling
at
me
inquiringly
through
a
haze
of
doubt
and
my
companion
words
reached
me
in
a
muffled
fashion
finally
however
i
succeeded
in
rousing
myself
from
this
dazed
condition
and
confident
as
ever
that
isobel
was
innocent
of
all
complicity
in
the
matter
the
presence
of
the
photograph
i
said
takes
us
a
step
further
do
you
see
inspector
that
this
is
a
deeply
and
cunningly
laid
trap
what
i
had
taken
for
a
series
of
unfortunate
coincidences
i
perceive
now
to
be
the
workings
of
an
elaborate
scheme
involving
perfectly
innocent
people
in
the
crime
h
said
gatton
doubtfully
it
may
be
as
you
suggest
at
any
rate
it
is
a
new
point
of
view
and
one
which
i
confess
had
not
occurred
to
me
there
is
one
witness
who
can
clear
up
any
doubt
on
the
subject
you
mean
marie
exactly
she
will
lie
beyond
doubt
but
we
shall
find
means
to
reach
the
truth
would
it
not
be
advisable
inspector
i
asked
excitedly
to
make
sure
of
her
at
once
gatton
smiled
grimly
and
marie
would
have
to
make
herself
invisible
to
evade
scotland
yard
now
he
replied
she
is
being
watched
closely
but
he
continued
what
do
you
make
of
these
marks
on
the
door
we
had
reclosed
the
garage
door
and
now
were
standing
immediately
inside
the
marks
to
which
my
companion
had
drawn
my
attention
were
situated
high
up
near
the
roof
this
may
account
for
the
statement
of
bolton
that
the
door
seemed
more
difficult
to
open
last
night
than
he
said
unless
i
am
greatly
mistaken
some
sort
of
attachment
existed
here
until
quite
recently
possibly
a
contrivance
for
reclosing
the
door
i
suggested
the
marks
in
fact
roughly
corresponded
to
those
which
would
be
made
by
the
presence
of
such
a
contrivance
and
there
seemed
to
have
been
some
attempt
where
it
had
been
removed
to
disguise
the
holes
left
by
the
screws
but
the
purpose
of
it
muttered
gatton
helplessly
god
knows
i
said
the
purpose
of
the
whole
thing
is
a
mystery
beyond
me
entirely
assuming
that
such
a
piece
of
mechanism
as
you
suggest
had
been
attached
to
the
door
mused
gatton
you
would
have
noticed
its
operation
last
night
unless
one
of
you
held
the
door
open
neither
of
us
held
the
door
i
interrupted
excitedly
i
remember
that
we
stood
just
outside
looking
in
i
was
behind
the
constable
and
he
was
directing
the
rays
of
his
lantern
into
the
place
h
muttered
gatton
then
it
was
a
contrivance
for
closing
the
door
it
was
something
else
suppose
we
investigate
the
other
door
we
proceeded
to
the
other
door
and
i
became
aware
of
an
intense
curiosity
respecting
what
we
should
find
and
of
a
conviction
too
that
there
would
be
evidence
here
of
another
attachment
in
this
i
was
quite
correct
some
piece
of
mechanism
had
evidently
been
fastened
to
this
door
also
together
we
stood
staring
up
at
these
and
then
rather
blankly
we
stared
at
one
another
we
only
lack
one
thing
said
gatton
the
scheme
upon
which
all
these
contrivances
and
apparently
isolated
episodes
were
hung
together
nothing
as
we
have
already
assumed
was
accident
and
nothing
coincidence
it
was
with
some
deliberate
purpose
that
the
constable
was
instructed
to
walk
through
this
garage
opening
and
shutting
the
doors
behind
him
from
whom
did
these
instructions
come
that
is
one
of
the
minor
points
which
i
have
already
cleared
up
he
replied
on
my
way
here
i
called
at
the
house
agent
as
you
know
since
i
have
the
keys
i
also
called
at
the
station
the
sergeant
who
was
on
duty
last
night
i
could
not
see
unfortunately
but
i
learned
that
it
was
a
woman
who
rang
up
my
heart
sank
lower
and
lower
it
seemed
to
me
as
we
stood
in
that
empty
garage
that
an
invisible
hand
was
drawing
a
net
closer
and
closer
about
isobel
and
my
ideas
became
increasingly
chaotic
for
the
purpose
of
it
all
eluded
me
try
how
i
would
to
conceive
of
a
scheme
by
which
any
one
could
profit
which
necessitated
the
imprisonment
or
worse
of
isobel
and
the
agent
i
asked
in
a
rather
toneless
voice
gatton
shook
his
head
i
have
no
reason
to
doubt
the
word
of
this
man
of
business
he
replied
because
at
the
time
when
i
saw
him
he
could
not
possibly
have
learned
of
the
crime
but
nevertheless
his
account
is
almost
unbelievable
it
appears
then
he
too
received
his
instructions
throughout
by
telephone
what
i
exclaimed
by
telephone
repeated
gatton
he
was
rung
up
about
ten
days
ago
by
some
one
who
made
a
verbal
offer
to
lease
the
red
house
for
a
period
of
twelve
months
a
foreigner
who
in
lieu
of
the
usual
references
was
prepared
to
pay
the
annual
rent
in
advance
as
the
red
house
to
use
an
irishism
was
regarded
as
something
of
a
white
elephant
the
agent
was
interested
apparently
and
when
on
the
following
day
the
sum
agreed
upon
arrived
by
post
he
did
not
demur
about
delivering
the
keys
to
the
prospective
lessee
who
desired
to
take
certain
measurements
in
regard
to
carpets
and
so
forth
wait
a
moment
i
interrupted
to
whom
did
he
deliver
these
keys
to
a
district
messenger
who
called
for
them
as
the
agent
had
been
advised
that
one
would
do
very
well
what
then
that
is
all
that
the
agent
had
to
say
what
that
is
all
substantially
there
is
nothing
more
it
is
quite
evident
that
the
sole
intention
of
this
unknown
lessee
was
to
secure
possession
of
the
house
for
the
purpose
of
the
crime
only
do
you
mean
that
from
first
to
last
no
one
but
the
district
messenger
appeared
in
the
matter
no
one
gatton
assured
me
and
the
rent
payment
of
which
quite
disarmed
the
agent
of
course
was
sent
in
the
form
of
treasury
notes
and
not
by
check
but
surely
some
name
some
address
must
have
been
given
a
name
was
given
replied
gatton
and
a
hotel
address
but
confirmation
of
their
accuracy
was
never
sought
after
the
receipt
of
the
money
and
the
voice
on
the
telephone
again
i
saw
that
odd
expression
creep
over
gatton
face
and
it
was
a
woman
voice
he
answered
great
heavens
i
muttered
what
does
it
all
mean
that
the
evidence
of
the
cabman
when
he
was
discovered
and
of
the
carter
who
had
taken
the
box
from
the
garage
to
the
docks
and
for
it
was
possibly
the
same
man
who
had
first
delivered
it
at
the
red
house
would
but
tighten
the
net
about
isobel
whom
i
knew
to
be
innocent
i
felt
assured
gatton
i
said
this
case
appears
to
me
to
resolve
itself
into
a
deliberate
conspiracy
of
which
the
end
was
not
the
assassination
of
sir
marcus
but
the
conviction
of
miss
merlin
gatton
looked
at
me
with
evident
complexity
written
all
over
him
i
begin
to
think
the
same
he
confessed
this
business
was
never
planned
and
carried
out
by
a
woman
i
swear
to
that
there
is
a
woman
concerned
in
it
for
at
every
point
we
come
upon
evidence
of
her
voice
issuing
the
mysterious
instructions
but
she
is
not
alone
in
the
matter
already
the
intricacy
of
the
thing
points
to
a
criminal
of
genius
when
we
know
the
whole
truth
if
we
ever
do
that
the
crime
was
planned
by
a
man
of
amazing
if
perverted
intellect
will
be
put
beyond
dispute
i
think
what
is
puzzling
me
gatton
i
said
is
the
connection
existing
between
the
incidents
which
took
place
in
this
garage
and
those
unknown
at
present
which
took
place
in
the
furnished
room
in
the
red
house
obviously
replied
gatton
a
supper
for
two
had
been
prepared
and
that
one
of
those
two
was
the
late
sir
marcus
is
perfectly
obvious
that
he
expected
the
other
to
be
miss
merlin
is
at
least
suggested
by
the
presence
of
her
photograph
in
the
room
for
you
will
have
noticed
that
it
is
the
photograph
there
nevertheless
i
said
firmly
i
am
positive
that
no
one
would
be
more
surprised
than
herself
to
learn
of
its
presence
and
as
i
have
already
said
replied
gatton
i
am
rapidly
coming
round
to
your
way
of
thinking
but
even
if
i
were
quite
sure
of
it
the
evidence
at
the
moment
is
all
the
other
way
you
will
admit
as
to
the
connection
between
this
garage
and
the
interrupted
supper
party
for
obviously
it
was
interrupted
this
it
must
be
my
business
to
find
out
do
you
think
i
said
that
we
are
attaching
perhaps
undue
importance
to
the
fact
that
some
kind
of
fittings
have
been
removed
from
the
doors
they
may
have
been
removed
by
the
late
occupier
and
the
call
to
the
police
depôt
may
have
been
made
with
the
idea
of
securing
a
witness
and
a
credible
one
to
the
presence
of
the
crate
here
on
the
night
of
the
murder
at
the
moment
replied
gatton
musingly
i
can
not
see
that
this
would
have
served
any
useful
purpose
but
nevertheless
you
may
be
right
i
am
going
to
assume
however
that
you
are
wrong
and
that
the
object
of
sending
bolton
here
last
night
was
to
open
and
shut
these
doors
i
propose
now
to
return
again
to
the
scene
of
the
interrupted
supper
leaving
the
garage
not
very
much
wiser
than
when
we
had
entered
it
we
paced
once
more
up
the
drive
in
the
shade
of
the
big
trees
and
were
greeted
again
by
the
malarious
smell
of
rotting
leaves
entering
the
red
house
gatton
and
i
proceeded
first
to
that
incredible
oasis
in
the
desert
of
empty
rooms
and
my
companion
made
a
detailed
examination
of
everything
in
the
place
even
sounding
the
walls
examining
the
fittings
of
the
door
and
finally
proceeding
through
the
hall
in
the
direction
of
the
south
wing
of
the
house
that
nearest
to
the
garage
what
he
expected
to
find
i
had
no
idea
but
his
attention
seemed
to
be
more
particularly
directed
towards
the
wainscot
and
the
of
the
empty
and
uncarpeted
rooms
which
we
entered
whatever
he
had
sought
he
failed
to
find
and
at
last
we
stood
in
a
desolate
apartment
looking
out
into
the
tangled
shrubbery
before
the
windows
the
back
of
the
garage
was
visible
from
there
and
i
viewed
it
dully
wondering
what
evil
secret
it
held
and
marveling
at
the
trick
of
fate
which
had
made
me
witness
of
an
act
in
this
gruesome
drama
of
course
gatton
i
said
we
are
all
along
assuming
that
sir
marcus
actually
met
his
death
in
this
house
we
must
remember
that
he
may
merely
have
been
brought
here
after
the
crime
such
a
short
period
elapsed
replied
the
inspector
between
his
leaving
the
new
avenue
theater
and
the
approximate
time
of
his
death
that
it
seems
unlikely
that
he
visited
any
intermediate
spot
but
he
may
not
have
been
in
the
crate
when
bolton
and
i
saw
it
i
do
believe
he
was
in
the
crate
then
replied
gatton
but
i
think
he
was
at
the
red
house
nevertheless
i
stared
at
him
with
curiosity
you
mean
that
he
was
in
the
house
at
the
time
that
the
constable
and
i
opened
the
garage
i
do
i
think
he
was
in
that
room
where
supper
was
laid
for
two
good
god
i
exclaimed
for
there
was
something
horrible
in
the
idea
of
the
man
who
now
lay
murdered
having
been
in
the
house
presumably
alive
whilst
bolton
and
i
had
stood
within
forty
yards
of
him
in
the
idea
that
it
had
lain
in
our
power
except
for
those
human
limitations
which
rendered
us
ignorant
of
his
presence
to
have
averted
his
fate
perhaps
to
have
checked
the
remorseless
movement
of
this
elaborate
murder
machine
which
seemingly
had
been
set
up
in
the
red
house
some
one
was
here
last
night
declared
gatton
suddenly
as
we
turned
to
leave
the
deserted
room
after
you
and
bolton
had
gone
everything
incriminating
the
assassin
has
been
removed
looking
at
the
matter
judicially
it
becomes
quite
evident
that
any
one
clever
enough
to
have
planned
this
crime
could
not
possibly
have
been
guilty
of
an
act
of
such
glaring
stupidity
as
that
of
accidentally
leaving
a
photograph
planted
upon
the
mantelpiece
that
this
fact
had
presented
itself
to
the
inspector
with
such
a
force
of
conviction
raised
a
great
load
from
my
mind
it
had
all
along
been
evident
to
me
but
i
had
feared
that
to
the
official
outlook
of
my
companion
and
the
official
outlook
is
always
peculiar
it
might
have
seemed
otherwise
the
clever
and
cunning
villain
who
planned
this
thing
i
said
has
overstepped
himself
as
you
say
gatton
if
the
murder
was
planned
artistically
in
his
attempt
to
throw
the
onus
of
the
crime
upon
innocent
shoulders
he
has
been
guilty
of
a
piece
of
very
mediocre
work
it
would
not
deceive
a
child
no
i
agree
with
you
there
the
discovery
of
that
photograph
has
done
more
to
convince
me
of
the
innocence
of
miss
merlin
than
any
amount
of
testimonials
to
her
good
character
could
ever
have
done
you
see
he
added
smiling
whimsically
all
sorts
of
people
hitherto
unsuspected
by
their
closest
friends
of
criminal
tendency
develop
that
taint
so
that
i
am
never
surprised
to
find
a
convicted
thief
or
assassin
possessed
of
credentials
which
would
do
justice
to
an
archbishop
but
when
i
see
an
obviously
artificial
clew
i
recognize
it
a
mile
off
real
clews
never
stare
you
in
the
face
like
that
coming
out
of
the
front
door
we
walked
down
the
drive
to
find
that
the
constable
on
duty
at
the
gate
had
been
joined
by
a
man
who
was
evidently
waiting
to
speak
to
the
inspector
yes
said
gatton
eagerly
at
sight
of
the
newcomer
we
have
her
sir
he
reported
tersely
does
he
refer
to
marie
i
asked
gatton
nodded
i
think
addison
he
said
i
will
proceed
immediately
to
bow
street
where
she
has
been
taken
to
be
interrogated
will
you
come
with
me
or
are
you
otherwise
engaged
i
hesitated
ere
i
replied
i
do
not
particularly
want
to
confront
this
woman
but
i
should
be
much
indebted
if
you
could
let
me
know
the
result
of
your
examination
i
shall
do
that
without
fail
said
gatton
and
some
time
i
should
be
obliged
if
you
could
provide
me
with
the
facts
concerning
the
little
which
you
said
you
had
in
your
possession
certainly
i
agreed
you
are
still
of
the
opinion
that
the
mark
upon
the
crate
and
the
image
of
the
have
an
important
bearing
upon
the
crime
i
do
doubt
it
was
the
reply
if
the
photograph
clew
is
a
false
one
the
cat
clew
is
a
true
one
and
one
to
be
followed
up
perhaps
he
added
it
would
be
as
well
if
you
returned
now
and
looked
out
the
points
which
you
think
would
be
of
interest
as
when
i
come
i
may
not
have
long
to
stay
i
will
do
so
i
said
although
i
think
i
can
lay
my
hands
upon
the
material
almost
immediately
accordingly
gatton
set
off
with
the
detective
who
had
brought
the
news
of
marie
arrest
and
i
turning
in
the
opposite
direction
proceeded
towards
my
cottage
in
such
a
state
of
mental
tumult
respecting
what
the
end
of
all
this
would
be
and
what
it
might
mean
for
isobel
that
i
found
myself
unable
to
think
connectedly
and
needless
to
say
i
failed
to
conjure
up
by
any
stretch
of
the
imagination
a
theory
which
could
cover
this
amazing
and
terrible
sequence
of
events
chapter
vii
the
cat
of
bubastis
she
belongs
to
the
innumerable
family
of
cats
which
suddenly
came
forth
from
the
ruins
of
tell
bastah
in
i
wrote
sir
gaston
maspero
egyptian
art
lying
before
me
on
the
table
and
were
in
a
few
years
scattered
over
the
whole
world
she
is
bâst
a
goddess
of
good
family
the
worship
of
whom
flourished
especially
in
the
east
of
the
delta
and
she
is
very
often
drawn
or
named
on
the
monuments
although
they
do
not
tell
us
enough
of
her
myths
or
her
origin
she
was
allied
or
related
to
the
sun
and
was
now
said
to
be
his
sister
or
wife
now
his
daughter
she
sometimes
filled
a
gracious
and
beneficent
rôle
protecting
men
against
contagious
diseases
or
evil
spirits
keeping
them
off
by
the
music
of
her
sistrum
she
had
also
her
hours
of
treacherous
perversity
during
which
she
played
with
her
victim
as
with
a
mouse
before
finishing
him
off
with
a
blow
of
her
claws
she
dwelt
by
preference
in
the
city
that
bore
her
name
poubastit
the
bubastis
of
classical
writers
her
temple
at
which
cheops
and
chephren
had
worked
while
building
their
pyramids
was
rebuilt
by
the
pharaohs
of
the
dynasty
enlarged
by
those
of
the
when
herodotus
visited
it
in
the
middle
of
the
fifth
century
he
considered
it
one
of
the
most
remarkable
he
had
seen
in
the
parts
of
egypt
through
which
he
had
traveled
the
fêtes
of
bâst
attracted
pilgrims
from
all
parts
of
egypt
as
at
the
present
day
those
of
sidi
ahmed
draw
people
to
the
modern
fair
of
tantah
the
people
of
each
village
crowded
into
large
boats
to
get
there
men
and
women
with
the
fixed
intention
of
enjoying
themselves
on
the
journey
a
thing
they
never
failed
to
do
they
accompanied
the
slow
progress
of
navigation
with
endless
songs
love
songs
rather
than
sacred
hymns
and
there
were
also
to
be
found
among
them
and
to
support
or
keep
time
to
the
voices
whenever
they
passed
by
a
town
they
approached
the
bank
as
near
as
they
could
without
landing
and
then
while
the
orchestra
redoubled
its
noise
the
passengers
threw
volleys
of
insults
and
coarse
remarks
at
the
women
standing
on
the
banks
they
retorted
and
when
they
had
exhausted
words
i
finished
my
notes
at
this
point
the
improper
behavior
of
the
ancient
egyptians
mentioned
by
the
great
egyptologist
having
no
possible
bearing
upon
the
matter
in
hand
i
thought
i
then
proceeded
to
add
some
facts
directly
relating
to
the
votive
offerings
laid
at
the
feet
of
the
goddess
the
greater
number
of
pilgrims
before
returning
home
left
a
souvenir
of
their
visit
at
the
feet
of
bâst
it
was
a
votive
stele
with
a
fine
inscription
and
a
picture
showing
the
donor
worshiping
his
goddess
or
a
statuette
in
blue
or
green
pottery
or
if
they
were
wealthy
in
bronze
silver
or
sometimes
gold
the
goddess
would
be
standing
seated
crouching
with
a
woman
body
and
a
cat
head
a
sistrum
or
an
ægis
in
her
hand
during
the
greek
period
the
figures
were
in
bronze
or
in
painted
or
gilded
wood
surmounted
by
a
cat
head
in
bronze
many
were
and
modeled
with
elaborate
art
they
had
eyes
of
enamel
and
amulets
on
the
forehead
the
learned
authority
went
on
to
explain
that
these
accumulated
offerings
were
after
a
time
stored
by
the
priests
in
cellars
or
in
pits
dug
expressly
for
them
veritable
similar
to
those
of
classical
times
they
accumulated
in
thousands
large
and
small
some
intact
and
fresh
as
when
just
made
others
already
out
of
shape
and
of
no
value
the
places
of
concealment
were
soon
forgotten
and
the
stores
hidden
therein
reposed
beyond
the
reach
of
men
until
the
day
when
the
chances
of
excavation
brought
them
to
light
my
notes
completed
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
little
image
of
green
enamel
ware
which
gatton
had
left
with
me
for
examination
it
was
not
possible
to
determine
the
period
at
which
it
was
buried
but
judging
from
the
contours
and
general
forms
together
with
the
aspect
of
the
enamel
i
thought
i
recognized
the
style
of
the
second
saïte
period
and
attributed
the
piece
to
the
early
ptolemies
or
the
fourth
century
it
was
the
time
when
the
worship
of
bâst
and
her
subordinate
forms
pakh
maît
was
most
popular
the
period
when
the
most
extensive
cemetery
of
cats
was
established
in
egypt
the
execution
of
the
little
figure
was
pure
egyptian
and
in
no
way
betrayed
greek
influence
so
far
had
my
studies
proceeded
when
i
heard
the
ring
and
coates
entered
the
room
gatton
to
see
you
sir
gatton
came
in
looking
if
anything
more
puzzled
than
when
i
had
left
him
at
the
red
house
also
i
thought
he
looked
tired
and
mix
yourself
a
drink
inspector
i
said
pointing
to
a
upon
which
refreshments
were
placed
thanks
replied
gatton
i
have
not
had
time
to
stop
for
a
drink
or
even
a
smoke
since
i
left
you
but
evidence
is
coming
in
quickly
enough
now
he
helped
himself
to
a
whisky
and
soda
being
an
old
visitor
and
one
used
to
the
bohemian
ways
of
my
household
then
setting
his
glass
upon
a
corner
of
my
he
dropped
into
the
armchair
and
began
in
leisurely
fashion
to
fill
his
pipe
although
the
hour
was
growing
late
sunset
was
still
a
long
way
off
and
the
prospect
visible
through
the
window
was
bathed
in
golden
light
from
where
i
sat
i
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
road
and
for
the
first
time
since
that
strange
experience
had
befallen
me
i
found
myself
wondering
if
the
follower
whom
i
had
detected
on
the
previous
night
and
those
blazing
feline
eyes
which
had
looked
out
at
me
from
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
hedge
could
have
had
any
possible
connection
with
the
tragedy
which
at
about
the
same
hour
was
being
enacted
in
the
red
house
i
determined
presently
to
confide
the
strange
particulars
to
my
friend
but
first
i
was
all
anxiety
to
learn
what
evidence
marie
had
given
and
that
this
evidence
to
which
he
had
referred
had
done
little
more
than
to
increase
gatton
perplexity
was
clear
enough
from
his
expression
therefore
tell
me
about
marie
i
said
gatton
smiled
grimly
took
a
drink
from
his
glass
and
then
she
began
of
course
as
i
had
anticipated
by
denying
all
knowledge
of
the
matter
but
recognizing
that
she
was
in
a
tight
corner
she
presently
changed
her
tactics
and
although
every
available
plan
was
tried
to
induce
her
to
change
her
ground
she
afterwards
stuck
to
the
extraordinary
story
which
we
first
extracted
from
her
briefly
it
was
this
the
late
sir
marcus
had
been
paying
unwelcome
attention
to
miss
merlin
for
a
long
time
and
marie
had
instructions
that
he
was
to
be
discouraged
as
much
as
possible
in
fact
i
am
pleased
to
say
that
your
theory
of
miss
merlin
ignorance
respecting
the
murder
plot
is
borne
out
by
the
testimony
of
her
maid
on
several
occasions
it
appears
when
he
sent
his
card
to
the
marie
returned
equivocal
messages
and
did
not
even
inform
her
mistress
of
sir
marcus
visit
this
had
been
going
on
for
some
time
when
one
night
whilst
miss
merlin
was
on
the
stage
a
telephone
call
came
for
marie
and
a
certain
proposal
was
made
to
her
it
was
this
if
on
the
following
night
sir
marcus
should
present
himself
she
was
to
tell
him
that
miss
merlin
would
take
supper
in
his
company
after
the
performance
but
that
he
was
to
observe
every
possible
precaution
marie
according
to
her
account
at
first
declined
to
entertain
the
proposal
but
being
informed
that
it
was
merely
intended
to
play
a
practical
joke
upon
the
baronet
she
ultimately
consented
i
may
add
that
the
promise
of
a
note
undoubtedly
hastened
her
decision
and
it
was
on
her
receipt
of
the
amount
by
post
on
the
following
morning
that
she
determined
to
carry
out
her
part
of
the
bargain
her
instructions
had
been
explicit
she
was
to
tell
sir
marcus
that
miss
merlin
would
see
him
after
the
performance
then
when
he
presented
himself
to
inform
him
that
her
mistress
had
decided
it
would
be
more
prudent
for
him
to
proceed
to
the
rendezvous
alone
where
she
would
join
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
she
was
to
give
him
the
door
key
which
had
arrived
with
the
money
and
to
direct
him
to
enter
and
wait
in
the
room
on
the
right
of
the
hall
a
cabman
who
knew
the
address
would
be
waiting
at
the
stage
door
gatton
paused
puffing
slowly
at
his
pipe
then
unknown
to
miss
merlin
he
continued
this
scheme
was
carried
out
sir
marcus
presented
himself
at
ten
and
received
marie
message
he
returned
about
eleven
and
she
told
him
as
she
had
been
instructed
that
her
mistress
would
join
him
in
a
quarter
of
an
hour
curiosity
respecting
the
joke
which
she
believed
was
being
played
upon
the
baronet
prompted
her
to
go
outside
the
to
see
if
there
was
actually
a
cab
waiting
there
was
and
she
heard
sir
marcus
ask
the
man
if
he
knew
the
address
to
which
he
was
to
drive
the
cabman
replied
that
he
did
and
marie
claims
to
know
no
more
about
the
matter
except
that
sir
marcus
drove
off
in
the
cab
and
that
her
mistress
returned
to
her
flat
alone
about
a
quarter
of
an
hour
later
next
point
inquiries
for
the
cabman
have
been
made
at
all
the
ranks
since
early
this
morning
and
he
turned
up
at
the
yard
about
a
couple
of
hours
ago
his
story
is
simple
enough
some
one
called
up
the
rank
where
he
chanced
to
be
standing
that
evening
instructing
him
to
call
for
sir
marcus
at
the
of
the
new
avenue
theater
and
to
drive
him
to
he
paused
yes
to
the
red
house
at
last
we
have
it
i
cried
excitedly
there
is
no
doubt
of
it
answered
gatton
the
cabman
drove
him
there
and
it
was
certainly
at
the
red
house
that
he
met
his
death
indeed
the
cabby
appears
to
be
the
last
witness
who
spoke
to
the
murdered
man
he
inquired
his
way
to
the
red
house
from
a
chance
pedestrian
a
tramp
whom
he
met
at
the
corner
of
college
road
he
has
even
described
this
person
to
us
but
i
do
think
his
evidence
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
our
searching
for
him
on
reaching
the
red
house
the
cabman
and
his
fare
found
it
to
be
vacant
sir
marcus
however
who
had
a
very
brusk
manner
with
his
inferiors
having
paid
the
cabman
curtly
dismissed
him
and
the
man
who
admits
having
bargained
for
a
double
fare
for
the
journey
because
it
was
such
an
spot
drove
away
vaguely
curious
but
not
so
curious
as
another
might
have
been
since
london
cabmen
are
used
to
strange
jobs
we
are
getting
near
the
heart
of
the
mystery
h
said
gatton
i
not
so
sure
the
deeper
we
go
the
darker
it
gets
a
man
has
been
scouring
the
neighborhood
all
day
in
quest
of
the
carter
who
delivered
the
crate
to
the
docks
but
so
far
without
results
i
consider
it
a
very
important
point
that
we
should
learn
not
only
how
and
when
the
crate
was
collected
but
when
and
by
whom
it
was
delivered
at
the
garage
another
question
i
said
although
i
believe
i
know
the
answer
was
it
a
man
or
a
woman
who
ordered
the
cab
both
in
the
case
of
marie
and
in
the
case
of
the
replied
gatton
it
was
a
woman
voice
that
spoke
thank
god
one
doubt
is
resolved
i
said
it
can
not
possibly
have
been
isobel
in
either
of
these
cases
right
agreed
gatton
promptly
i
am
as
glad
as
you
are
there
is
clearly
a
second
woman
in
the
case
yet
i
ca
bring
myself
to
believe
that
this
elaborate
scheme
was
the
work
of
a
woman
not
of
a
woman
i
suggested
not
of
any
woman
he
replied
besides
who
put
the
body
into
the
crate
what
kind
of
a
woman
would
it
be
who
could
do
a
deed
like
that
in
other
words
said
i
you
are
still
without
a
ghost
of
a
clew
to
the
identity
of
the
person
who
committed
the
murder
and
to
the
means
employed
resting
his
pipe
upon
an
the
inspector
took
up
from
my
the
little
image
of
bâst
and
held
it
up
between
finger
and
thumb
we
always
come
back
to
the
green
cat
he
said
slowly
i
will
trouble
you
now
addison
for
the
history
of
such
a
little
image
as
this
yes
i
replied
abstractedly
but
there
is
a
matter
about
which
i
have
not
spoken
to
you
hitherto
because
quite
frankly
i
had
doubted
if
it
had
any
existence
outside
my
imagination
but
every
new
development
of
the
case
is
so
utterly
fantastic
that
i
no
longer
regard
my
experience
as
being
in
the
least
degree
outside
the
province
of
possibility
before
we
go
further
therefore
into
the
purely
archæological
side
of
the
inquiry
and
i
have
still
serious
doubt
respecting
the
usefulness
of
such
a
quest
let
me
relate
a
peculiar
experience
which
i
had
last
night
after
i
had
left
bolton
gatton
listened
in
silence
whilst
i
gave
him
an
account
of
that
evasive
shadow
which
i
had
perceived
behind
me
and
then
of
the
great
cat
eyes
which
had
looked
in
through
the
window
his
expression
of
naïve
wonderment
was
almost
funny
and
when
i
had
concluded
well
addison
said
he
if
you
had
told
me
this
story
before
i
had
taken
up
mystery
for
so
i
observe
drawing
an
evening
paper
from
his
pocket
the
press
has
agreed
to
entitle
the
case
i
should
have
suggested
that
your
peculiar
studies
had
begun
to
tell
upon
your
nerves
but
this
voice
on
the
and
this
empty
house
in
which
only
one
room
was
furnished
finally
the
green
cat
painted
on
the
and
the
green
cat
which
stands
there
upon
the
table
have
prepared
me
for
even
stranger
things
than
your
adventure
of
last
night
yet
i
urged
there
is
no
visible
connection
between
the
episodes
of
the
case
and
this
strange
apparition
which
i
saw
in
the
garden
last
night
there
was
no
visible
connection
between
sir
marcus
body
in
a
in
the
hold
of
the
and
the
garage
of
the
house
in
college
road
until
we
found
one
retorted
gatton
anyway
i
am
glad
you
mentioned
the
matter
to
me
i
will
take
a
note
of
it
for
it
may
prove
to
provide
a
link
in
the
chain
and
now
taking
out
a
and
pencil
for
the
history
of
these
cat
things
i
sighed
rather
wearily
as
i
crossed
the
room
to
my
bookcase
and
took
down
the
volume
of
gaston
maspero
the
same
which
i
had
been
reading
but
had
returned
to
its
shelf
as
gatton
had
been
admitted
we
have
it
here
in
a
nutshell
i
said
gatton
methodically
noted
the
passages
which
i
read
to
him
the
task
concluded
h
he
muttered
scanning
his
notes
very
strange
very
strange
indeed
had
also
her
hours
of
treacherous
perversity
during
which
she
played
with
her
victim
as
with
a
mouse
before
finishing
him
off
with
a
blow
of
her
claws
he
raised
his
eyes
and
stared
at
me
strangely
she
played
with
her
victim
as
with
a
mouse
he
murmured
before
finishing
him
off
with
a
blow
chapter
viii
my
visitor
for
long
enough
after
gatton
departure
i
sat
thinking
over
our
conversation
despite
the
lateness
of
the
hour
at
which
he
had
departed
he
had
had
no
thought
of
rest
and
was
setting
out
in
quest
of
further
evidence
to
point
to
the
author
of
sir
marcus
death
the
room
was
laden
with
tobacco
smoke
for
our
conference
had
lasted
more
than
two
hours
but
dusk
was
very
fully
established
and
when
presently
as
i
sat
there
in
the
dark
contemplating
the
horrible
labyrinth
into
which
my
steps
had
drifted
coates
entered
ah
coates
i
said
light
up
he
switched
on
the
electric
light
and
i
saw
layers
of
smoke
clouds
drifting
from
the
open
window
towards
the
newly
opened
door
shall
you
be
going
out
again
sir
asked
coates
standing
rigidly
to
attention
as
was
his
custom
when
addressing
me
i
think
not
coates
i
replied
i
have
done
enough
for
one
day
but
i
should
be
glad
if
you
would
ring
up
the
new
avenue
theater
and
inquire
if
miss
merlin
will
speak
to
me
it
will
be
about
time
now
for
the
performance
to
have
finished
very
good
sir
said
coates
and
proceeded
to
make
the
call
whilst
i
sat
listlessly
smoking
and
listening
to
his
voice
presently
miss
merlin
did
not
appear
sir
he
announced
she
is
indisposed
i
thought
as
much
i
muttered
i
could
hardly
have
expected
after
such
a
day
of
horror
and
excitement
that
she
would
have
been
capable
of
appearing
ring
up
her
flat
coates
i
added
i
should
like
to
speak
to
her
for
i
know
she
is
in
great
trouble
indeed
sir
coates
permitted
himself
to
remark
is
it
something
to
do
with
the
discovery
at
the
docks
this
morning
sir
it
is
coates
i
replied
it
is
an
utterly
damnable
business
indeed
sir
said
coates
again
and
went
to
the
telephone
three
minutes
later
i
was
talking
to
isobel
i
find
it
utterly
impossible
to
tell
you
what
has
happened
she
declared
since
i
saw
you
last
i
feel
incapable
of
thinking
and
of
course
it
was
quite
out
of
the
question
for
me
to
go
to
the
theater
but
it
is
not
so
bad
as
it
might
have
been
she
hesitated
then
i
was
only
able
to
give
them
very
short
notice
unfortunately
but
from
a
selfish
point
of
view
as
you
know
i
was
leaving
the
stage
very
shortly
yes
i
answered
dully
i
know
but
have
you
seen
the
police
i
have
seen
inspector
gatton
she
replied
but
as
he
told
me
that
he
was
coming
along
to
you
no
doubt
you
know
what
took
place
no
i
replied
he
did
not
mention
the
visit
but
you
quite
recognize
the
fact
isobel
that
he
does
not
regard
you
as
being
in
any
way
concerned
in
this
ghastly
affair
he
was
awfully
kind
she
admitted
in
fact
i
quite
changed
my
opinion
regarding
the
methods
of
the
police
authorities
after
my
interview
with
inspector
gatton
but
although
he
was
so
extremely
tactful
with
me
i
really
can
not
forgive
him
his
suspicions
which
he
was
at
scarcely
any
pains
to
disguise
regarding
eric
regarding
eric
i
exclaimed
oh
continued
isobel
he
may
have
concealed
his
views
from
you
as
he
knows
that
you
are
a
friend
of
eric
but
he
was
less
careful
about
concealing
them
from
me
to
all
intents
and
purposes
eric
is
under
police
surveillance
but
this
is
utterly
incredible
said
i
you
do
mean
to
tell
me
isobel
that
coverly
has
persisted
in
his
silence
respecting
his
movements
last
night
if
he
has
done
so
in
the
circumstances
he
has
only
himself
to
thank
social
position
and
everything
else
counts
for
nothing
when
an
inquiry
concerning
a
murder
is
concerned
he
knows
that
perfectly
well
i
think
i
spoke
hotly
and
certainly
i
spoke
with
a
certain
indignation
for
i
very
strongly
resented
coverly
attitude
in
the
case
which
could
only
add
to
the
difficulties
and
sorrows
of
position
yet
a
moment
afterwards
i
regretted
that
i
had
done
so
for
are
going
to
quarrel
with
me
too
she
asked
pathetically
what
do
you
mean
who
has
been
quarreling
with
you
eric
quarreled
with
me
fiercely
at
the
solicitors
and
when
i
begged
of
him
to
be
frank
respecting
his
movements
last
night
his
attitude
became
she
hesitated
almost
unbearable
he
did
not
seem
to
realize
that
i
was
only
thinking
of
him
nor
did
he
seem
to
realize
the
construction
which
i
might
have
placed
upon
his
silence
i
mean
jack
what
can
he
possibly
have
to
conceal
temporarily
i
felt
myself
to
have
become
what
it
be
that
coverly
was
concealing
the
idea
of
complicity
in
the
crime
i
scouted
nothing
could
have
induced
me
to
believe
it
only
one
explanation
presented
itself
to
my
mind
as
evidently
it
had
presented
itself
to
isobel
another
woman
however
you
may
depend
i
said
endeavoring
to
speak
soothingly
that
he
has
some
good
and
sufficient
reason
for
this
silence
and
one
which
is
not
in
any
way
discreditable
nevertheless
he
will
have
to
reconsider
his
attitude
in
the
near
future
of
course
there
are
times
when
almost
every
one
of
us
would
be
hard
put
to
it
to
establish
an
alibi
if
we
were
called
upon
to
do
so
as
regards
witnesses
of
our
movements
i
mean
but
at
least
we
can
state
roughly
where
we
were
during
any
hour
of
the
day
even
if
we
have
to
trust
to
luck
to
find
witnesses
to
prove
the
truth
of
words
his
attitude
of
silence
isobel
is
ridiculous
have
you
seen
the
evening
papers
she
asked
pathetically
some
of
them
i
replied
they
have
got
my
name
in
already
she
continued
and
my
photograph
appears
in
one
it
is
outrageous
how
they
leap
at
an
opportunity
for
scandal
it
will
all
be
cleared
up
i
said
speaking
with
as
much
confidence
as
i
had
at
my
command
you
know
and
i
know
that
coverly
is
innocent
and
i
do
believe
that
gatton
thinks
him
guilty
a
while
longer
we
talked
and
then
i
returned
rather
wearily
to
my
chair
in
the
room
where
the
air
was
still
laden
with
tobacco
fumes
without
believing
it
to
contain
any
very
special
significance
as
i
had
supposed
but
merely
attracted
by
the
strangeness
of
the
passage
i
remembered
how
gatton
had
harped
upon
maspero
description
of
the
attributes
of
bâst
sometimes
she
plays
with
her
victim
as
with
a
mouse
etc
the
big
book
with
its
fine
plates
several
of
them
representing
cats
similar
to
that
which
gatton
had
left
behind
for
my
more
particular
examination
still
lay
open
upon
the
table
and
i
reread
those
passages
appertaining
to
the
character
of
the
which
i
had
marked
for
gatton
information
scarce
noting
what
i
read
for
all
the
time
i
was
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
manifold
problems
of
the
case
i
sat
there
for
an
hour
perhaps
in
fact
until
i
was
interrupted
by
the
entrance
of
coates
shall
you
require
me
again
sir
he
inquired
no
i
replied
you
had
better
turn
in
now
as
in
all
probability
we
shall
be
early
afoot
coates
inspector
gatton
will
probably
be
calling
for
me
very
good
sir
said
coates
and
performing
a
smart
he
walked
out
of
the
room
i
went
on
reading
not
in
quest
of
any
particular
information
but
in
that
idle
mood
when
one
reads
anything
interesting
or
otherwise
for
a
time
i
heard
my
conscientious
batman
fastening
doors
and
windows
as
was
his
nightly
custom
then
the
door
of
his
own
room
closed
and
i
heard
him
no
more
when
i
first
became
aware
of
the
howling
of
distant
dogs
i
know
not
but
it
was
with
a
great
start
that
i
was
aroused
from
my
by
the
ringing
of
the
i
realized
that
i
had
sat
much
longer
than
i
had
supposed
it
was
a
quarter
to
one
gatton
was
my
first
thought
there
must
be
an
unexpected
development
in
the
case
calling
in
some
way
for
my
services
coates
was
a
sound
sleeper
and
evidently
had
not
been
awakened
by
the
ringing
of
the
bell
therefore
arrayed
as
i
was
in
pajamas
slippers
and
for
this
during
the
hot
weather
was
my
indoor
costume
i
walked
out
along
the
little
corridor
unbolted
the
front
door
and
opened
it
a
woman
stood
there
for
a
moment
i
thought
foolishly
that
it
was
isobel
and
my
heart
gave
a
great
leap
but
the
delusion
was
instantly
dispelled
when
my
visitor
spoke
her
voice
had
a
totally
different
tone
from
that
of
isobel
it
was
a
low
almost
caressing
voice
with
a
vaguely
husky
note
in
it
fascinating
in
a
way
yet
although
i
found
myself
unable
to
account
for
the
fact
vaguely
uncanny
queer
please
excuse
me
she
said
you
will
naturally
wonder
what
has
brought
a
visitor
to
your
door
at
this
hour
of
the
night
and
indeed
my
explanation
is
a
strange
one
she
glanced
apprehensively
over
her
shoulder
as
she
spoke
out
into
the
darkness
of
the
roadway
i
observed
that
she
was
apparently
in
evening
dress
and
wore
a
very
handsome
cloak
having
a
thick
silk
scarf
so
draped
about
her
head
and
shoulders
that
her
face
was
quite
concealed
very
clearly
now
i
could
hear
the
howling
of
dogs
instinct
is
a
curious
thing
and
that
which
it
prompted
me
to
do
at
the
moment
when
i
found
myself
confronting
this
strange
woman
was
promptly
to
awaken
coates
honestly
i
was
afraid
of
her
and
wished
for
nothing
better
than
to
have
the
closed
door
between
us
this
was
all
the
more
unaccountable
as
she
had
the
appearance
and
manners
of
a
cultured
woman
presenting
indeed
a
figure
of
great
elegance
as
she
stood
there
with
her
tall
slender
form
outlined
by
the
moonlight
which
slanted
down
through
the
trees
to
form
a
scimitar
of
light
upon
the
path
behind
her
of
course
i
could
never
have
acted
upon
this
singular
instinct
but
the
decision
was
taken
out
of
my
hands
for
suddenly
my
visitor
uttered
a
low
cry
of
fear
swayed
dizzily
and
seemed
about
to
fall
perforce
i
stepped
forward
to
support
her
and
before
i
knew
what
had
happened
she
had
tottered
into
the
passage
resting
heavily
upon
my
shoulder
close
the
door
she
said
in
that
low
husky
voice
quick
quick
i
have
seen
them
again
an
unpleasant
chill
communicated
itself
to
me
the
eyes
she
whispered
two
great
eyes
have
followed
me
that
was
why
i
knocked
at
your
door
i
was
afraid
it
was
enough
the
mention
of
two
great
eyes
leaving
my
visitor
temporarily
to
take
care
of
herself
i
sprang
to
the
door
and
closed
it
hurriedly
as
i
turned
in
the
light
from
the
partly
open
study
door
i
saw
the
woman
walking
slowly
ahead
of
me
i
overtook
her
holding
the
door
fully
open
for
her
to
pass
in
please
sit
down
a
while
i
said
you
have
evidently
been
seriously
alarmed
still
there
was
no
sign
from
coates
whose
voice
would
have
been
welcome
music
to
my
ears
for
i
could
not
reconcile
myself
to
this
woman
presence
strive
how
i
might
nor
could
i
understand
how
she
had
come
to
be
wandering
alone
in
such
a
place
at
that
hour
one
bond
of
sympathy
there
was
between
us
i
could
forgive
any
one
fearing
those
awful
eyes
for
i
had
feared
them
myself
and
i
could
no
longer
doubt
that
some
strange
apparition
was
haunting
the
vicinity
believe
me
i
quite
understand
i
said
turning
to
my
visitor
it
is
most
extraordinary
but
i
believe
there
is
some
unusually
large
cat
frequenting
the
neighborhood
at
present
i
stood
by
the
side
table
and
was
on
the
point
of
pouring
out
a
glass
of
water
when
the
woman
raised
her
hand
in
a
gesture
of
refusal
thank
you
she
said
thank
you
but
i
am
quite
recovered
and
indeed
if
the
cause
of
my
alarm
is
no
more
than
a
cat
as
you
say
i
will
proceed
she
laughed
and
her
laughter
was
but
very
musical
in
the
light
of
the
shaded
i
could
see
the
gleam
of
white
teeth
through
her
veil
but
i
could
not
imagine
why
she
swathed
herself
in
that
manner
yet
in
spite
of
this
enwrapping
she
could
not
disguise
the
fact
that
she
possessed
remarkably
large
and
beautiful
eyes
she
seemed
now
to
have
recovered
her
composure
but
i
noted
that
she
made
no
attempt
to
remove
her
veil
are
you
quite
sure
that
you
will
not
be
nervous
on
your
way
i
asked
oh
no
i
am
staying
with
some
friends
quite
near
she
explained
detecting
my
curiosity
and
i
was
indiscreet
enough
to
wander
out
at
this
hour
to
post
a
letter
possibly
this
explanation
might
have
satisfied
me
it
is
even
possible
that
i
should
have
thought
little
more
about
the
incident
at
that
time
when
i
lived
in
a
constant
turmoil
of
episodes
even
stranger
but
by
one
of
those
accidents
which
sometimes
seem
to
be
directed
by
the
hand
of
an
impish
fate
i
was
to
learn
who
or
what
my
visitor
was
when
i
say
i
was
to
learn
what
she
was
perhaps
i
err
more
correctly
i
was
to
learn
what
she
was
not
namely
an
ordinary
human
being
it
was
as
she
rose
to
depart
that
the
hand
of
fate
intervened
i
had
only
one
lamp
burning
in
the
room
a
and
at
this
moment
preceded
by
a
sudden
accession
of
light
due
to
some
flaw
of
the
generating
plant
the
filament
expired
plunging
the
room
into
darkness
i
stood
up
with
a
startled
cry
i
do
not
deny
that
i
felt
ill
at
ease
in
the
gloom
with
my
strange
visitor
but
worse
was
to
come
looking
across
the
darkened
room
to
the
chair
upon
which
she
was
seated
i
saw
a
pair
of
blazing
eyes
regarding
me
fixedly
something
in
their
horrid
luminous
watchfulness
told
me
that
my
slightest
movement
was
perceptible
to
my
uncanny
visitor
of
whom
i
could
see
nothing
but
those
two
fiery
eyes
what
i
did
or
what
occurred
within
the
next
few
seconds
i
am
not
prepared
to
state
in
detail
i
know
i
uttered
a
hoarse
cry
and
threw
myself
back
from
those
dreadful
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
advancing
upon
me
the
cry
awakened
coates
i
heard
the
pad
of
his
bare
feet
upon
the
floor
as
he
leaped
out
of
bed
and
an
instant
later
his
door
was
opened
and
he
came
blundering
out
into
the
darkened
passage
hello
sir
he
cried
in
a
voice
here
coates
i
replied
and
my
tones
were
far
from
normal
falling
over
a
chair
on
his
way
coates
came
running
into
the
study
an
impression
i
had
of
a
flying
shape
and
the
dimly
seen
square
of
the
open
window
for
that
side
of
the
cottage
lay
in
shadow
seemed
momentarily
to
become
blackened
bring
a
light
coates
i
cried
the
lamp
has
gone
out
matches
on
the
table
sir
said
coates
instantly
i
remembered
that
this
was
the
case
that
they
lay
in
fact
near
to
my
hand
i
struck
one
and
in
its
flickering
light
looked
about
the
room
my
visitor
had
gone
palpably
through
the
window
for
certainly
the
front
door
had
not
been
opened
she
has
gone
coates
i
exclaimed
and
on
this
occasion
it
was
coates
who
repeated
in
an
amazed
voice
but
even
as
he
spoke
my
attention
had
become
diverted
i
was
staring
at
that
portion
of
the
table
upon
which
maspero
book
lay
beside
it
had
stood
the
little
bubastis
statuette
but
the
statuette
was
there
no
longer
chapter
ix
the
velvet
curtain
this
gets
me
well
out
of
my
depth
addison
said
inspector
gatton
we
were
standing
in
the
garden
at
a
point
near
to
my
open
study
window
a
small
intervened
between
the
path
and
the
high
privet
hedge
it
lay
much
in
shade
and
coates
had
set
tobacco
plants
there
but
the
soil
was
softer
here
than
elsewhere
clearly
marked
upon
it
were
the
imprints
of
little
shoes
it
seems
to
take
us
back
to
the
days
of
jack
my
friend
continued
which
was
before
my
time
i
do
think
mystery
was
ever
cleared
up
no
i
replied
meeting
his
questioning
glance
it
never
was
satisfactorily
therefore
the
analogy
is
an
unfortunate
one
but
as
you
say
it
certainly
looks
as
though
my
visitor
had
sprung
across
a
hedge
it
absolutely
mad
said
gatton
gloomily
far
from
helping
us
it
only
plunges
us
deeper
in
the
mire
we
returned
to
the
study
and
you
will
have
seen
the
daily
papers
asked
the
inspector
i
nodded
practically
all
of
them
they
give
a
hateful
prominence
to
the
name
of
miss
merlin
and
to
that
of
the
new
baronet
sir
eric
said
gatton
significantly
i
stared
at
him
straightly
do
you
seriously
believe
said
i
that
eric
coverly
had
anything
whatever
to
do
with
the
death
of
his
cousin
gatton
stirred
uneasily
in
his
chair
well
he
answered
ignoring
everything
else
for
the
moment
who
else
benefits
by
sir
marcus
coverly
death
it
was
a
poser
a
question
which
i
had
dreaded
because
i
had
known
it
to
be
unanswerable
he
inherits
the
title
continued
gatton
and
on
the
death
of
lady
burnham
coverly
he
inherits
friars
park
there
is
some
clause
or
entail
or
legal
hotchpotch
whereby
the
estate
and
revenue
remain
hers
during
her
lifetime
but
i
understand
the
estate
is
mortgaged
that
i
have
to
confirm
addison
replied
gatton
sir
solicitor
has
no
information
on
the
point
and
that
of
sir
marcus
man
of
business
is
inexact
but
even
supposing
that
only
the
title
is
concerned
many
a
man
has
lost
his
life
for
less
then
you
have
to
consider
miss
merlin
in
what
way
i
demanded
in
relation
to
the
attitude
of
sir
marcus
jealousy
makes
men
and
women
do
strange
and
desperate
things
the
character
of
eric
coverly
the
new
baronet
is
a
very
odd
one
he
is
headstrong
and
in
some
respects
weak
i
admitted
but
otherwise
he
is
an
ordinary
english
gentleman
with
the
traditions
of
an
old
name
and
a
public
school
to
back
him
up
i
tell
you
gatton
it
nonsense
his
army
career
alone
shows
him
to
be
a
sound
man
yes
murmured
gatton
he
was
awarded
a
decoration
for
distinguished
service
in
egypt
that
seemingly
simple
remark
struck
me
with
all
the
force
of
a
physical
blow
gatton
began
quietly
to
load
his
pipe
without
even
glancing
in
my
direction
but
the
covert
significance
of
his
words
was
all
too
apparent
gatton
i
said
what
the
devil
are
you
driving
at
he
slightly
shrugged
his
shoulders
what
you
may
term
the
side
of
the
case
he
replied
turns
on
matters
egyptian
does
it
very
well
who
else
that
we
know
about
is
associated
or
ever
has
been
associated
with
egypt
but
the
woman
ah
said
gatton
now
you
are
getting
down
to
the
depths
but
assuming
that
the
extraordinary
characteristics
of
this
visitor
of
yours
can
be
explained
in
some
way
by
deliberate
trickery
for
example
might
she
not
be
a
woman
whom
eric
coverly
met
in
egypt
i
stared
silently
a
while
and
then
in
short
a
rival
of
miss
merlin
i
suggested
precisely
the
trick
with
the
photograph
was
just
of
the
kind
one
would
expect
from
a
madly
jealous
woman
everything
planned
with
supreme
cunning
but
the
scene
at
which
the
hated
rival
enters
the
scheme
badly
overdone
and
you
believe
coverly
silence
to
be
due
to
the
fact
that
he
is
shielding
some
one
well
that
or
shielding
himself
what
else
can
it
mean
a
man
suspected
of
murder
does
hesitate
to
establish
an
alibi
unless
he
is
in
a
desperately
tight
corner
the
exact
position
of
your
acquaintance
in
the
case
is
not
apparent
to
me
at
the
moment
i
admit
but
i
seem
to
have
heard
that
there
have
been
rare
instances
of
human
beings
with
luminous
eyes
quite
right
inspector
i
agreed
i
hope
very
shortly
to
have
some
further
particulars
for
you
bearing
upon
this
point
i
am
endeavoring
to
obtain
a
work
by
dealing
with
teratology
as
to
her
extraordinary
activity
and
agility
gatton
continued
we
must
remember
that
a
privet
hedge
is
not
like
a
stone
wall
i
mean
she
may
not
have
actually
cleared
the
whole
six
feet
and
after
all
this
is
the
age
of
the
athletic
girl
there
are
women
athletes
who
can
perform
some
extraordinary
feats
of
of
course
there
are
still
a
number
of
witnesses
to
be
discovered
and
examined
but
i
know
by
now
exactly
what
to
expect
it
an
ingenious
idea
although
not
entirely
new
to
me
the
whole
thing
has
been
managed
by
means
of
the
telephone
a
powerful
ally
of
the
modern
criminal
briefly
what
happened
was
this
the
red
house
selected
because
of
its
lonely
position
but
also
because
it
was
fairly
accessible
was
leased
by
our
missing
assassin
without
any
personal
interview
taking
place
we
have
to
look
then
in
the
first
instance
for
some
one
possessing
considerable
financial
resources
it
was
by
the
effective
substitution
of
a
year
rent
in
cash
for
the
more
usual
references
that
our
man
or
woman
whom
i
will
call
secured
possession
of
the
keys
and
right
of
entry
to
the
premises
a
limited
amount
of
furniture
was
obtained
in
the
same
manner
we
have
found
the
firm
who
supplied
it
but
i
do
doubt
that
the
business
was
done
over
the
telephone
cash
being
paid
as
before
duplicate
keys
must
have
been
made
for
some
of
the
doors
i
think
a
simple
matter
we
shall
find
that
the
furnishing
people
as
well
as
the
caterer
who
later
on
supplied
the
supper
were
admitted
to
the
red
house
by
a
district
messenger
or
else
had
the
keys
posted
to
them
for
the
purpose
the
whole
business
was
built
up
around
a
central
idea
simple
in
itself
that
of
inveigling
sir
marcus
into
the
prepared
his
attendance
at
the
new
avenue
theater
last
night
was
doubtless
assured
although
we
may
never
prove
it
by
another
of
these
mysterious
telephone
messages
probably
purporting
to
come
from
miss
merlin
the
thoroughness
with
which
arranged
for
a
crate
to
be
delivered
at
the
garage
and
for
the
body
of
the
murdered
man
to
be
taken
to
the
docks
and
shipped
to
the
west
indies
illuminates
the
character
of
the
person
we
have
to
seek
discovery
sooner
or
later
was
inevitable
of
course
it
came
sooner
because
of
the
accident
at
the
docks
had
it
come
later
i
do
doubt
that
would
have
dismantled
the
red
house
again
so
that
the
investigation
would
have
been
severely
handicapped
as
it
is
the
only
dismantling
done
was
the
most
important
of
all
you
mean
i
said
with
keen
interest
the
answered
gatton
the
cunning
device
around
which
all
these
trappings
were
erected
we
do
have
to
wait
for
the
coroner
inquest
nor
the
pathologists
report
to
know
that
sir
marcus
was
asphyxiated
in
that
room
where
supper
was
laid
for
two
i
muttered
can
you
doubt
it
no
i
said
and
i
do
i
have
allowed
nothing
to
be
touched
continued
gatton
and
i
am
going
around
there
now
to
make
a
final
attempt
to
unravel
the
mystery
of
how
sir
marcus
met
his
death
there
is
one
detail
said
i
which
it
seems
impossible
to
fit
into
its
proper
place
in
the
scheme
the
figure
of
bâst
painted
upon
the
crate
you
have
that
at
scotland
yard
and
the
little
image
of
the
goddess
which
was
stolen
from
my
table
last
night
gatton
stood
up
uttering
a
sigh
i
have
always
found
addison
he
replied
that
it
is
these
outstanding
features
of
a
case
these
pieces
which
do
seem
to
fit
that
are
the
most
valuable
clews
it
the
apparently
simple
cases
in
which
there
is
no
outstanding
point
that
are
the
most
baffling
i
laughed
shortly
one
could
not
very
well
complain
of
the
lack
of
such
features
in
mystery
i
said
as
a
confrère
of
mine
remarked
when
the
body
of
sir
marcus
was
discovered
in
the
crate
the
whole
thing
is
as
mad
as
in
wonderland
gatton
presently
departed
for
the
red
house
and
i
accompanied
him
for
i
was
intensely
curious
to
learn
by
what
means
the
murder
of
sir
marcus
had
been
accomplished
as
i
proposed
later
in
the
morning
to
call
on
isobel
coates
drove
gatton
and
myself
as
far
as
the
red
house
and
i
instructed
the
man
to
wait
for
me
although
the
morning
was
still
young
the
prominence
given
by
the
press
to
this
sensational
crime
had
resulted
in
the
presence
of
quite
a
considerable
group
of
pilgrims
who
even
thus
early
had
arrived
to
look
upon
the
scene
of
the
mysterious
tragedy
london
is
a
city
of
onlookers
the
most
trivial
street
accident
never
lacks
its
interested
audience
and
a
house
in
which
a
murder
is
reputed
to
have
taken
place
becomes
a
center
upon
which
the
idly
curious
focus
from
the
four
points
of
the
compass
our
arrival
created
a
subdued
excitement
amongst
the
nondescript
group
gathered
upon
the
pavement
despite
the
efforts
of
a
constable
on
duty
men
women
and
children
persistently
gathered
before
the
gates
of
the
drive
peering
up
at
the
empty
house
as
if
they
anticipated
seeing
the
face
of
the
murderer
or
an
apparition
of
the
victim
appear
behind
one
of
the
windows
a
considerable
group
too
was
gathered
before
the
garage
but
as
gatton
and
i
descended
and
began
to
walk
up
the
drive
there
was
a
general
movement
in
our
direction
i
wonder
said
i
if
the
wanted
man
is
among
the
crowd
one
reads
that
murderers
are
irresistibly
drawn
back
to
the
scene
of
their
crimes
he
may
be
replied
gatton
anyway
there
are
two
men
there
for
certain
so
that
will
do
well
to
be
upon
his
guard
a
few
moments
later
i
found
myself
again
in
the
of
the
red
house
and
the
place
now
seemed
to
me
to
have
taken
on
an
air
of
oppressive
mystery
in
the
very
deserted
silence
of
the
house
i
detected
something
sinister
of
course
no
doubt
this
was
merely
an
effect
created
upon
my
mind
by
the
ghastly
associations
of
the
place
but
i
know
that
whereas
on
the
previous
day
surprise
and
curiosity
had
been
the
most
characteristic
emotions
aroused
by
our
discoveries
there
this
morning
something
darker
seemed
to
have
taken
their
place
and
i
found
myself
listening
for
a
sound
that
never
came
and
wondering
vaguely
and
vainly
what
secret
was
hidden
in
this
desolate
mansion
by
gatton
orders
the
room
in
which
that
gruesome
supper
was
laid
had
been
left
undisturbed
and
once
more
we
stood
surveying
the
spotless
napery
and
sparkling
silver
i
listened
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
upon
the
mantelpiece
and
stared
dully
at
the
wine
resting
in
the
which
now
contained
nothing
but
dirty
water
a
big
dish
of
fruit
stood
upon
the
table
peaches
and
apricots
and
nectarines
and
several
large
wasps
had
entered
through
one
of
the
windows
which
some
one
had
opened
and
were
buzzing
sleepily
around
the
dish
lastly
there
beside
the
clock
stood
isobel
photograph
for
any
evidence
of
a
struggle
i
looked
in
vain
but
the
nature
of
my
companion
investigation
was
more
obscure
again
the
whole
of
his
attention
seemed
to
be
directed
upon
the
wall
the
and
the
suddenly
ah
i
said
i
know
what
you
are
looking
for
some
connection
between
this
room
and
the
garage
gatton
who
was
kneeling
examining
a
lower
panel
of
the
door
looked
up
with
a
grim
smile
perhaps
i
am
he
replied
by
the
tone
of
his
voice
i
knew
that
whatever
he
had
sought
he
had
failed
once
more
to
find
presently
desisting
from
this
quest
of
his
he
stood
and
stared
curiously
for
some
time
at
a
recess
immediately
behind
one
of
the
chairs
drawn
up
to
the
supper
table
we
had
already
explored
this
recess
and
had
found
it
to
be
vacant
gatton
advanced
towards
it
and
drew
aside
the
curtain
which
was
draped
in
the
opening
it
was
a
recess
about
four
feet
wide
by
three
deep
and
it
contained
nothing
in
the
nature
of
furniture
or
ornament
does
anything
strike
you
as
curious
about
this
arrangement
said
my
companion
i
looked
for
a
long
time
but
failed
to
detect
anything
of
a
notable
nature
nothing
i
said
except
that
it
seems
a
peculiar
idea
to
drape
a
curtain
before
a
recess
in
that
way
and
such
a
curtain
said
gatton
fingering
the
texture
i
in
turn
touched
the
material
with
my
fingers
and
found
it
to
be
an
extremely
heavy
velvet
looking
upward
i
noticed
that
it
was
attached
to
a
rod
set
so
high
in
the
wall
on
either
side
that
the
top
of
the
drapery
actually
touched
the
ceiling
well
said
gatton
looking
at
me
oddly
in
addition
to
the
texture
of
the
curtain
do
you
notice
anything
else
no
i
confessed
well
he
continued
you
may
remember
that
yesterday
when
i
examined
this
place
i
had
to
drape
the
curtain
over
a
chair
which
i
moved
here
for
the
purpose
in
order
to
see
the
recess
so
you
did
i
said
i
remember
well
does
it
strike
you
as
odd
if
you
notice
the
way
it
is
fastened
above
you
will
see
that
it
is
not
upon
rings
in
other
words
it
is
not
intended
to
be
opened
you
see
that
it
is
in
one
piece
so
that
anybody
having
occasion
to
enter
the
recess
would
have
to
lift
it
aside
and
let
it
fall
to
behind
him
i
studied
the
arrangement
of
the
drapings
more
closely
and
saw
that
his
statement
was
correct
also
i
saw
something
else
and
this
room
has
been
lighted
by
gas
at
some
time
i
cried
here
up
under
the
is
a
plug
most
houses
are
provided
both
with
gas
and
electric
light
about
here
replied
gatton
abstractedly
but
even
before
he
had
finished
speaking
i
saw
his
expression
change
and
in
a
moment
he
had
dragged
a
chair
into
the
recess
hold
the
curtain
back
he
directed
sharply
standing
on
the
chair
he
began
to
examine
the
little
brass
plug
to
which
i
had
drawn
his
attention
for
some
time
i
watched
him
in
silence
and
then
what
do
you
think
you
have
found
i
inquired
he
glanced
down
over
his
shoulder
i
think
i
have
found
a
he
replied
chapter
x
hanging
evidence
isobel
came
into
the
room
and
approached
the
chair
from
which
i
had
arisen
in
her
plain
morning
frock
with
the
sun
bringing
out
those
wonderful
russet
tints
in
her
hair
but
having
that
frightened
look
still
in
her
eyes
she
had
never
seemed
more
beautiful
yet
i
saw
as
i
rose
to
greet
her
that
she
was
laboring
under
the
influence
of
dangerous
nervous
excitement
you
are
worried
about
eric
i
said
when
we
had
exchanged
those
rather
formal
greetings
in
which
i
think
we
took
mutual
shelter
certainly
i
did
and
later
i
was
to
know
that
isobel
did
so
too
every
day
seems
to
make
the
case
grow
blacker
against
him
she
replied
sinking
down
upon
the
settee
beside
me
and
indeed
the
shadow
which
had
fallen
upon
all
of
us
seemed
at
that
moment
almost
palpable
a
thing
to
be
felt
like
the
darkness
of
egypt
and
not
to
be
dispelled
even
by
the
brightness
of
the
morning
when
did
you
last
see
coverly
isobel
raised
her
head
wearily
last
night
and
he
seemed
to
think
that
some
one
was
following
him
a
detective
i
noticed
that
isobel
spoke
of
eric
coverly
with
a
certain
manner
of
restraint
for
which
i
could
not
account
yet
perhaps
it
was
only
natural
that
she
should
do
so
but
at
the
time
i
was
foolishly
blind
to
the
opposing
emotions
which
fought
and
conflicted
within
her
he
still
refused
to
explain
his
movements
on
the
night
of
the
murder
i
asked
yes
he
persisted
in
his
extraordinary
silence
said
isobel
the
look
of
trouble
in
her
eyes
grew
more
acute
what
i
can
not
understand
is
a
sort
of
attitude
of
resentment
which
he
has
lately
adopted
of
resentment
towards
whom
towards
but
oh
it
quite
incomprehensible
jack
and
it
is
making
me
horribly
unhappy
he
complained
so
bitterly
too
about
this
police
surveillance
to
which
he
is
subjected
he
realizes
that
the
coroner
is
almost
certain
to
put
a
wrong
construction
on
his
silence
but
instead
of
being
frank
about
it
he
adopts
even
when
alone
with
me
this
incomprehensible
attitude
of
resentment
in
fact
his
behavior
almost
suggests
that
am
responsible
for
his
present
misfortunes
he
must
be
mad
i
said
and
i
expect
i
spoke
bitterly
for
isobel
lowered
her
eyes
and
her
face
flushed
with
embarrassment
do
think
that
i
condemn
him
i
added
hastily
but
really
in
justice
to
you
if
not
in
order
to
clear
his
own
good
name
he
should
speak
out
at
once
are
you
expecting
to
see
him
isobel
nodded
i
am
expecting
him
at
almost
any
moment
she
replied
then
glancing
aside
at
a
number
of
daily
papers
which
lay
littered
upon
the
floor
beside
the
settee
of
course
you
have
seen
what
the
press
has
to
say
about
it
she
added
i
nodded
what
can
you
expect
said
i
it
is
one
of
those
cases
in
which
practically
all
the
evidence
although
it
is
of
a
purely
circumstantial
nature
points
to
an
innocent
man
as
the
culprit
i
feel
very
keenly
annoyed
with
coverly
for
not
only
is
he
involving
both
of
you
in
a
most
unsavory
case
but
he
is
also
hindering
the
work
of
justice
in
fact
by
his
inexplicable
silence
he
is
although
no
doubt
unconsciously
affording
the
murderer
time
to
elude
the
law
even
as
i
spoke
the
words
i
heard
a
cab
draw
up
in
the
street
below
and
glancing
out
of
the
window
i
saw
coverly
alight
from
the
cab
pay
the
man
and
enter
the
doorway
his
bearing
was
oddly
furtive
that
as
i
thought
with
a
sudden
pang
of
a
fugitive
a
few
moments
later
he
came
into
the
room
and
his
expression
when
he
found
me
there
was
one
of
marked
hostility
eric
coverly
bore
no
resemblance
whatever
to
the
deceased
baronet
from
whom
he
inherited
the
title
belonging
as
he
did
to
quite
another
branch
of
the
family
whereas
sir
marcus
had
been
of
a
dark
and
sallow
type
eric
coverly
was
one
of
those
fair
english
types
handsome
in
an
undistinguished
way
and
as
a
rule
of
a
light
and
careless
disposition
there
had
never
been
any
very
close
sympathy
between
us
for
the
studies
to
which
i
devoted
so
much
time
were
by
him
regarded
as
frankly
laughable
absurdities
although
well
enough
informed
he
was
typical
of
his
class
and
no
one
could
justly
have
catalogued
him
as
an
intellectual
good
morning
addison
he
said
having
greeted
isobel
in
a
perfunctory
fashion
which
i
assumed
to
be
accounted
for
by
my
unwelcome
presence
the
men
of
your
fleet
street
tribe
have
conspired
to
hang
me
i
see
do
talk
nonsense
coverly
i
said
bruskly
this
misapprehension
is
bound
to
arise
if
you
decline
to
give
any
account
of
your
movements
but
it
is
an
outrage
cried
coverly
hotly
what
the
devil
do
know
about
marcus
death
i
am
perfectly
convinced
that
you
know
nothing
whatever
but
then
i
have
known
you
for
many
years
the
street
tribe
to
whom
you
refer
merely
regard
you
as
a
unit
of
our
rather
large
population
in
a
case
of
this
kind
coverly
all
men
are
equal
whilst
i
had
been
delivering
myself
of
this
somewhat
priggish
speech
designed
i
may
add
in
to
spur
coverly
to
a
rejoinder
which
might
throw
some
light
upon
the
mystery
he
had
regarded
me
with
an
expression
of
ever
increasing
dislike
i
noted
that
there
were
shadows
under
his
eyes
and
that
he
was
in
a
highly
nervous
and
excited
condition
he
had
slept
but
little
i
judged
during
the
last
hours
and
had
possibly
had
recourse
to
stimulants
to
enable
him
to
face
the
new
trials
which
arose
with
every
day
i
do
feel
called
upon
he
said
angrily
to
give
an
account
of
my
movements
to
every
policeman
who
cares
to
inquire
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
the
matter
i
have
said
so
and
i
am
not
accustomed
to
have
my
word
doubted
my
dear
coverly
said
i
you
must
be
perfectly
well
aware
that
sooner
or
later
you
will
have
to
relinquish
this
heroic
pose
will
you
allow
no
one
to
advise
you
you
will
have
to
answer
the
coroner
and
if
you
persist
in
this
extraordinary
refusal
to
give
a
simple
answer
to
a
simple
question
surely
you
realize
that
the
matter
will
be
transferred
to
a
higher
tribunal
oh
i
told
you
that
they
had
hanged
me
in
fleet
street
already
isobel
cried
coverly
with
a
burst
of
unmirthful
laughter
but
and
no
man
could
have
construed
the
thing
favorably
to
coverly
to
my
anger
and
amazement
he
added
let
them
do
it
i
speak
if
i
choose
but
not
otherwise
that
i
was
annoyed
with
the
young
fool
already
my
remarks
to
him
which
had
transgressed
every
code
of
good
taste
must
sufficiently
have
shown
but
i
had
hoped
to
provoke
him
to
a
declaration
which
would
clear
his
name
from
the
shadow
which
was
settling
darkly
upon
it
and
which
would
raise
that
shadow
from
the
girl
who
stood
beside
him
watching
me
with
a
sort
of
reproachful
look
in
her
dark
eyes
now
i
recognized
that
i
could
remain
no
longer
and
keep
the
peace
therefore
perhaps
it
is
time
that
i
went
about
my
own
business
i
said
conjuring
up
a
smile
although
it
must
have
been
a
dreary
one
and
ceased
to
interfere
with
the
affairs
of
other
people
isobel
anything
i
can
do
you
know
you
may
command
coverly
i
am
deeply
sorry
about
this
business
he
barely
touched
my
extended
hand
but
instantly
turned
and
walked
to
the
bay
window
descending
to
the
street
i
had
immediate
confirmation
of
coverly
statement
that
his
movements
were
watched
in
the
porch
below
a
man
stood
talking
to
the
as
i
appeared
he
immediately
averted
his
face
and
began
to
light
a
cigarette
nevertheless
i
had
had
time
to
recognize
him
as
the
man
who
had
brought
gatton
news
of
marie
detention
it
was
in
a
truly
perturbed
frame
of
mind
that
i
proceeded
on
my
way
to
the
offices
i
would
have
sacrificed
much
to
have
been
afforded
means
to
comfort
isobel
a
furious
anger
towards
the
man
who
thus
deliberately
had
brought
doubt
and
unhappiness
upon
her
had
taken
up
permanent
quarters
in
my
mind
i
counted
coverly
declination
to
clear
himself
little
better
than
the
attitude
of
a
cad
i
read
religiously
through
a
pile
of
cuttings
bearing
upon
the
case
and
found
the
unmistakable
trend
of
opinion
to
be
directed
towards
coverly
as
the
culprit
the
use
made
of
isobel
name
enraged
me
to
boiling
point
and
i
presently
took
up
the
entire
bundle
of
cuttings
and
crammed
them
into
a
basket
i
was
engaged
in
stamping
them
down
with
my
foot
when
i
was
called
to
the
telephone
inspector
gatton
was
speaking
from
new
scotland
yard
and
his
voice
was
very
grave
can
you
possibly
come
along
at
once
he
asked
there
is
a
new
development
a
most
unpleasant
one
he
would
say
no
more
over
the
telephone
therefore
i
hurried
out
to
where
coates
was
waiting
and
in
ten
minutes
found
myself
in
one
of
those
bare
comfortless
apartments
which
characterize
the
headquarters
of
the
metropolitan
police
force
with
his
hat
off
gatton
looked
more
like
a
seaman
than
ever
for
he
had
short
crisply
curly
hair
and
that
kind
of
line
of
cranium
which
one
associates
with
members
of
the
senior
service
upon
a
chair
set
in
a
recess
formed
by
one
of
the
lofty
windows
a
leather
grip
rested
it
was
wet
and
stained
and
had
palpably
been
recovered
but
recently
from
the
water
seeing
my
glance
straying
towards
this
object
at
the
moment
of
my
entrance
the
inspector
nodded
yes
said
he
it
has
just
come
in
what
is
it
well
replied
gatton
sitting
upon
a
corner
of
the
table
and
folding
his
arms
it
is
a
piece
of
evidence
sufficient
to
hang
the
most
innocent
man
breathing
he
eyed
me
in
a
significant
manner
and
i
felt
my
heart
beginning
to
beat
more
rapidly
may
i
know
the
particulars
certainly
i
asked
you
to
come
along
for
the
purpose
of
telling
you
sir
eric
coverly
refusal
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
him
had
necessitated
his
being
watched
as
you
know
i
mean
to
say
sheerly
automatic
the
commissioner
himself
could
make
an
exception
well
last
night
he
left
his
chambers
and
started
for
miss
merlin
flat
he
came
out
of
a
back
door
and
went
along
a
narrow
passage
instead
of
going
out
at
the
front
he
evidently
thought
he
had
got
away
unobserved
he
was
carrying
that
good
heavens
i
said
the
young
fool
seems
determined
to
put
a
rope
around
his
own
neck
as
a
matter
of
fact
continued
gatton
he
was
unobserved
he
was
followed
right
across
james
park
by
the
lake
he
lingered
for
some
time
and
the
man
tracking
him
kept
carefully
out
of
sight
of
course
there
was
nobody
else
about
at
the
moment
and
presently
thinking
himself
safe
coverly
dropped
his
bag
in
the
water
immediately
he
set
off
walking
rapidly
again
and
he
was
followed
right
to
miss
merlin
door
but
the
spot
where
he
had
dropped
the
bag
had
been
marked
of
course
and
when
i
came
in
here
it
had
been
fished
up
and
placed
there
for
my
inspection
with
misgivings
what
does
it
contain
i
asked
inspector
gatton
walked
across
to
the
chair
and
threw
the
bag
open
first
he
took
out
several
lumps
of
wet
coal
to
weight
it
of
course
he
said
then
one
by
one
he
withdrew
from
the
clammy
interior
a
series
of
ragged
garments
the
garments
of
a
tramp
a
pair
of
heavy
boots
there
were
a
pair
of
patched
trousers
and
an
old
shabby
coat
a
greasy
cap
and
finally
a
threadbare
red
muffler
gatton
looked
hard
at
me
he
will
have
to
break
his
obstinate
silence
now
he
said
failing
our
discovery
of
new
clews
pointing
in
another
direction
this
is
hanging
evidence
it
is
maddening
i
cried
can
nothing
be
done
gatton
is
there
no
possible
line
of
inquiry
hitherto
neglected
which
might
lead
to
the
discovery
of
the
truth
for
whatever
your
own
ideas
may
be
personally
i
am
certain
that
coverly
is
innocent
gatton
replaced
the
sodden
garments
one
by
one
in
the
bag
frowning
as
he
did
so
and
it
occurred
to
me
this
morning
he
replied
that
there
one
inquiry
which
in
justice
to
the
suspected
man
and
in
order
to
round
off
the
investigation
should
be
instituted
i
afraid
coverly
will
have
a
bad
time
in
the
coroner
court
but
it
is
even
possible
that
something
might
be
done
before
the
inquest
now
he
looked
at
me
quizzically
and
knowing
your
keen
personal
interest
in
the
case
i
am
going
to
make
a
suggestion
it
is
probably
going
outside
the
intentions
of
the
chief
in
regard
to
your
share
of
the
inquiry
but
i
risk
that
i
stipulate
however
that
anything
you
learn
is
to
be
communicated
direct
to
me
not
to
the
is
this
arrangement
consistent
with
your
journalistic
conscience
quite
i
said
eagerly
my
contributions
to
the
are
always
subject
of
course
to
your
censorship
what
is
it
that
you
propose
i
should
do
this
said
gatton
tersely
i
should
like
to
know
under
what
circumstances
roger
coverly
died
roger
coverly
i
echoed
the
son
of
sir
burnham
coverly
continued
gatton
and
therefore
the
direct
heir
to
the
title
he
died
somewhere
abroad
about
five
or
six
years
ago
and
as
a
result
the
late
sir
marcus
inherited
the
baronetcy
on
the
death
of
his
uncle
sir
burnham
you
will
remember
that
the
man
morris
spoke
of
the
existing
between
lady
burnham
coverly
and
sir
marcus
because
of
the
premature
death
of
her
own
son
of
course
i
follow
you
i
said
eagerly
you
suggest
that
i
should
go
down
to
friar
park
and
interview
lady
burnham
coverly
exactly
replied
gatton
it
very
irregular
of
course
but
i
know
you
well
enough
to
take
my
chance
of
a
carpeting
i
may
send
a
man
down
as
well
i
too
much
to
do
in
town
to
think
of
going
myself
but
i
will
advise
you
of
any
such
step
the
motive
underlying
inspector
gatton
suggestion
was
perfectly
evident
to
me
and
i
experienced
a
feeling
of
gratitude
for
the
humanity
which
directed
it
i
held
out
my
hand
and
thanks
gatton
i
said
you
can
leave
the
matter
in
my
care
with
every
confidence
i
will
start
for
friar
park
good

gatton

you

chapter
xi
the
scarred
man
it
was
towards
the
hour
of
seven
in
the
evening
that
i
reached
the
abbey
inn
at
upper
crossleys
itself
among
the
most
hoary
buildings
of
the
ancient
village
it
belonged
to
the
days
when
brethren
from
the
once
great
monastery
of
had
labored
in
the
abbey
meadows
and
fished
in
the
little
stream
which
ran
slowly
through
a
neighboring
valley
time
had
scarred
it
deeply
and
the
balcony
overhanging
the
coachyard
sagged
in
a
rather
alarming
fashion
as
though
about
to
drop
down
from
sheer
old
age
the
surrounding
country
had
impressed
me
at
first
sight
there
were
long
billowing
hills
and
vales
much
of
their
surface
densely
wooded
but
with
wide
spaces
under
cultivation
and
even
greater
tracts
of
a
sort
of
very
wild
in
aspect
and
conjuring
up
pictures
of
outlaws
camps
and
the
clash
of
battling
feudal
days
hard
by
had
resided
of
old
a
warden
of
the
marches
and
the
ruins
of
his
stronghold
might
still
be
seen
on
the
crest
of
a
hill
from
the
room
allotted
to
me
i
could
look
out
over
a
varied
prospect
of
farmland
and
heath
terminated
by
the
woody
slopes
which
everywhere
hemmed
in
the
valley
peeping
above
the
outer
fringe
of
trees
showed
a
tower
of
some
old
house
whereof
the
rest
was
hidden
by
verdure
having
partaken
of
a
typical
country
dinner
the
small
number
of
courses
being
amply
compensated
by
their
quantity
i
lighted
my
pipe
and
went
down
to
the
being
minded
to
learn
something
of
the
neighborhood
at
first
hand
from
any
chance
visitor
who
might
serve
my
purpose
the
landlord
a
somewhat
taciturn
member
of
his
class
sat
behind
the
bar
pipe
in
mouth
as
i
entered
and
only
one
other
man
was
in
the
room
this
was
a
fellow
with
a
very
wild
eye
attired
in
the
manner
of
a
and
wearing
leggings
and
a
fur
cap
a
sporting
rifle
stood
in
the
corner
beside
him
the
landlord
nodded
and
the
other
gave
me
a
good
evening
as
i
entered
whereupon
i
determined
to
try
the
as
the
more
likely
source
of
information
and
is
the
shooting
good
hereabouts
i
asked
by
way
of
opening
a
conversation
my
inquiry
seemed
hugely
to
amuse
the
man
none
better
was
the
reply
it
thick
with
game
sir
it
is
for
sure
and
nobody
to
profit
only
he
winked
at
the
landlord
young
jim
corder
the
landlord
emitted
a
deep
grunt
which
was
evidently
recognized
by
the
other
as
a
laugh
for
he
himself
laughed
in
a
wild
and
not
wholly
pleasant
manner
whereby
i
concluded
that
young
jim
corder
was
a
standing
joke
in
the
neighborhood
you
look
as
though
you
knew
a
hare
from
a
partridge
said
i
so
i
take
your
word
for
it
this
remark
provoked
a
second
and
deeper
growl
from
the
landlord
and
a
further
burst
of
outlandish
laughter
from
my
acquaintance
the
presently
why
sir
if
i
tell
you
declared
the
latter
them
birds
all
know
me
like
i
was
their
father
they
do
i
says
morning
regular
and
them
birds
all
bows
to
me
they
does
when
the
laughter
had
subsided
scenting
possible
information
i
gather
said
i
that
you
get
few
nowadays
gloom
descended
upon
both
my
gossips
you
right
you
are
sir
replied
the
he
right
ai
he
martin
martin
the
landlord
growled
it
occurred
to
me
that
he
regarded
the
other
with
a
certain
disfavor
this
country
continued
the
vaguely
waving
his
arm
around
is
a
blighted
spot
a
blighted
spot
ai
it
martin
martin
growled
whilst
the
studied
him
covertly
since
sir
burnham
went
to
his
long
rest
these
parts
ai
knowed
themselves
i
tellin
you
sir
ai
knowed
it
all
that
quiet
winter
and
summer
alike
the
park
all
shut
up
and
the
park
the
park
in
them
days
war
it
martin
martin
achieved
speech
he
removed
his
pipe
and
it
were
hawkins
he
concurred
silence
fell
for
a
minute
or
two
my
new
acquaintance
hawkins
and
martin
both
seemed
to
be
pondering
upon
the
degeneracy
of
upper
crossleys
and
i
could
mot
help
thinking
that
hawkins
took
a
secret
delight
in
it
then
surely
the
park
is
still
occupied
by
lady
coverly
i
asked
aye
hawkins
nodded
she
kep
me
on
me
and
the
missus
she
has
like
the
real
lady
she
is
but
things
is
different
things
is
wrong
ai
they
martin
he
asked
with
a
mischievous
glance
at
the
stolid
host
things
is
agreed
martin
best
part
of
park
be
shut
up
declared
hawkins
horses
gone
carriages
gone
everybody
gone
only
me
and
my
old
woman
there
must
be
house
servants
i
interjected
my
old
woman
cried
hawkins
triumphantly
same
as
i
tellin
you
you
mean
that
lady
coverly
lives
alone
in
the
place
with
only
er
hawkins
to
look
after
her
it
was
martin
the
landlord
who
answered
my
question
things
ai
right
he
observed
and
returned
to
his
mouth
the
pipe
which
he
had
removed
for
the
purpose
of
addressing
me
you
do
know
half
of
it
declared
hawkins
what
job
for
instance
i
ask
you
what
is
it
having
thus
spoken
he
exchanged
a
significant
look
with
the
landlord
and
relapsed
into
silence
even
my
offer
to
replenish
his
tankard
although
it
was
accepted
did
not
result
in
any
further
confidences
prospects
of
crops
and
fruit
were
briefly
touched
upon
but
that
exchange
of
glances
between
mine
host
and
hawkins
seemed
to
have
been
mutually
understood
to
mean
that
the
conversation
touching
park
had
proceeded
far
enough
it
was
very
mystifying
and
naturally
it
served
only
to
pique
my
curiosity
a
certain
quality
of
loneliness
which
had
seemed
to
belong
to
the
village
even
in
the
brightness
of
the
summer
evening
now
asserted
itself
potently
seated
there
in
the
quiet
little
inn
parlor
i
recalled
that
many
of
the
cottages
to
right
and
left
of
the
abbey
inn
had
exhibited
every
indication
of
being
deserted
and
the
lack
of
patrons
instanced
by
the
emptiness
of
the
was
certainly
not
ascribable
to
the
quality
of
the
ale
which
was
excellent
a
sort
of
blight
it
would
seem
had
descended
upon
humanity
in
upper
crossleys
it
was
all
very
curious
reflecting
upon
the
matter
and
sometimes
interjecting
a
word
or
two
into
the
purely
technical
and
very
desultory
conversation
proceeding
between
the
landlord
and
hawkins
i
sat
looking
from
one
to
the
other
more
than
ever
convinced
that
no
friendship
was
lost
between
them
my
position
in
the
room
was
such
that
any
one
entering
would
not
detect
my
presence
until
he
was
right
up
to
the
bar
and
to
this
sheltered
seat
i
was
undoubtedly
indebted
for
a
very
strange
experience
during
a
lull
in
the
patently
forced
conversation
i
heard
footsteps
upon
the
cobbles
outside
hawkins
and
the
landlord
exchanged
a
swift
glance
and
then
to
my
surprise
they
both
stared
at
me
questioningly
before
a
word
could
be
exchanged
however
and
before
i
had
time
even
to
surmise
what
this
covert
uneasiness
might
portend
a
young
fellow
entered
whose
carriage
and
dress
immediately
attracted
my
attention
he
was
attired
then
in
a
sort
of
burlesque
fashionable
lounge
suit
and
wore
a
straw
hat
set
rakishly
backward
on
his
dark
hair
he
carried
gloves
and
a
malacca
cane
and
his
gait
was
one
of
assured
superiority
he
was
a
muscular
young
fellow
and
might
ordinarily
have
been
after
a
rustic
fashion
but
what
principally
rendered
him
noticeable
was
the
fact
that
he
wore
surgical
bandages
around
his
neck
in
lieu
of
a
collar
and
that
his
face
was
literally
a
mosaic
of
evening
martin
evening
hawkins
he
said
jauntily
and
advancing
to
the
bar
the
usual
martin
as
he
gave
the
order
and
as
the
landlord
turned
to
execute
it
exhibiting
a
sort
of
deference
the
embarrassed
glance
of
hawkins
who
was
watching
me
uncomfortably
drew
the
attention
to
my
presence
he
turned
in
a
flash
and
i
saw
those
parts
of
his
face
which
were
visible
between
the
pieces
of
strapping
to
turn
fierily
red
his
brown
eyes
glared
at
me
and
martin
he
cried
throwing
out
his
hand
in
the
landlord
direction
martin
damn
you
there
is
a
stranger
here
why
the
devil
did
you
tell
me
sorry
edward
said
the
landlord
setting
a
glass
of
whisky
before
the
excited
man
no
time
it
a
lie
cried
the
other
with
a
wild
fury
which
so
trivial
a
matter
did
not
seem
to
warrant
a
deliberate
damned
lie
you
want
to
make
me
the
of
the
place
taking
up
the
glass
he
dashed
it
violently
to
the
sanded
floor
so
that
it
was
shattered
to
bits
then
snatching
off
his
hat
he
held
it
as
a
shield
between
my
inquiring
gaze
and
his
plastered
face
and
ran
out
of
the
room
at
the
door
damn
you
all
he
shouted
back
at
us
i
heard
his
quick
footsteps
receding
then
as
he
turned
the
corner
the
sound
died
away
i
looked
across
at
hawkins
he
was
staring
into
his
tankard
with
which
he
was
describing
slow
circles
as
if
to
stir
the
contents
martin
having
raised
the
was
phlegmatically
engaged
in
sweeping
up
the
fragments
of
glass
into
a
dustpan
it
came
to
me
all
at
once
that
these
simple
folk
regarded
the
other
outburst
as
a
personal
matter
their
attitude
was
that
of
the
grieved
elders
of
a
family
some
member
of
which
has
misbehaved
himself
but
assuredly
i
was
not
prepared
to
concur
in
this
shielding
silence
the
pressman
within
me
demanded
an
explanation
a
strange
young
man
i
said
tentatively
very
touchy
i
should
think
touchy
repeated
hawkins
glancing
up
quickly
i
seen
him
take
tom
pike
by
the
scruff
of
his
neck
and
the
seat
of
his
pants
and
pitch
him
in
the
for
askin
of
him
who
his
tailor
was
i
have
indeed
said
i
a
local
carpentier
no
doubt
ah
said
martin
glancing
at
me
as
he
turned
to
his
seat
behind
the
bar
very
with
he
is
evidently
acutely
sensitive
of
his
present
disfigurement
might
i
suggest
that
his
most
recent
encounter
was
with
a
entanglement
but
to
my
acute
disappointment
martin
merely
growled
shaking
his
head
gloomily
and
in
this
significant
gesture
he
was
closely
imitated
by
hawkins
therefore
is
he
badly
disfigured
i
persisted
only
one
is
deep
replied
hawkins
glancing
almost
apologetically
at
the
landlord
the
unfortunate
incident
seemed
to
have
drawn
them
more
closely
together
the
one
on
his
neck
but
he
prides
himself
on
his
looks
do
he
martin
he
do
agreed
martin
i
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
i
never
neglect
an
opportunity
of
this
nature
for
however
irrelevant
to
the
matter
in
hand
an
episode
may
seem
to
be
not
infrequently
i
have
found
that
it
is
by
the
pursuit
of
such
chance
clews
that
one
is
led
to
the
very
piece
of
news
that
is
sought
drink
up
gentlemen
i
said
and
as
the
night
draws
on
we
shall
just
have
time
for
a
peg
of
whisky
before
ten
my
effort
proved
successful
for
whilst
martin
prepared
the
ordered
drinks
almost
with
alacrity
hawkins
became
quite
confidential
young
edward
hines
that
was
sir
he
confided
in
a
church
whisper
his
father
is
the
biggest
farmer
round
these
parts
and
young
edward
is
a
terror
with
the
gals
he
is
mind
you
he
straight
out
about
it
comes
in
here
he
do
and
says
straight
out
who
after
and
it
woe
betide
the
one
who
takes
him
up
on
it
i
glad
my
gal
is
up
to
london
with
that
edward
about
i
am
the
drinks
being
placed
upon
the
counter
he
ceased
and
good
health
said
i
then
yes
about
our
mutilated
young
friend
i
prompted
well
continued
hawkins
it
kind
o
funny
ai
it
martin
the
landlord
growled
edward
he
come
in
here
three
weeks
back
all
puffed
up
with
himself
said
he
got
an
appointment
with
a
lady
down
from
london
what
was
coming
all
the
way
from
west
wingham
to
see
him
did
he
martin
martin
corroborated
he
see
her
too
declared
hawkins
with
a
sort
of
schoolboy
naïveté
and
he
see
her
again
four
nights
after
she
give
him
a
present
a
keepsake
he
showed
us
then
he
seen
her
a
third
time
and
hawkins
ceased
speaking
and
looked
at
the
landlord
as
if
mutely
appealing
for
his
aid
in
making
clear
to
me
what
occurred
at
this
third
tryst
with
the
mysterious
lady
from
london
go
on
prompted
martin
tell
him
he
stopping
here
he
all
right
i
keenly
appreciated
the
compliment
conveyed
by
this
the
longest
speech
of
the
evening
and
raised
my
glass
to
him
well
then
hawkins
resumed
we
did
see
him
for
a
night
or
two
but
on
the
wednesday
the
thursday
corrected
martin
right
you
are
martin
agreed
hawkins
the
thursday
it
were
i
met
farmer
hines
comin
back
from
wingham
market
as
i
came
here
it
were
the
thursday
well
then
on
the
thursday
young
edward
he
turns
up
after
dark
sort
of
slinked
in
he
did
there
was
three
or
four
of
us
here
there
was
that
night
was
there
martin
it
were
market
day
slinked
in
he
did
and
his
face
was
like
you
see
it
only
worse
he
never
said
a
word
to
nobody
and
nobody
never
said
nothin
to
him
not
likely
just
gulped
down
a
double
scotch
and
slinked
out
what
do
you
think
about
that
for
a
story
eh
sir
he
looked
at
me
triumphantly
for
my
own
part
i
must
confess
i
was
disappointed
a
squabble
between
a
rustic
lothario
and
some
local
virago
did
not
excite
me
so
intensely
as
it
seemed
to
excite
my
companions
is
that
all
you
know
of
the
matter
i
asked
no
answered
martin
it
ai
tell
him
hawkins
aye
resumed
hawkins
he
might
as
well
know
as
he
livin
here
well
sir
young
edward
he
very
quiet
about
what
happened
to
him
maybe
we
should
have
thought
so
much
about
it
like
if
it
had
been
that
in
this
very
bar
six
months
ago
he
plagued
the
life
out
of
young
harry
adams
for
what
reason
i
asked
idly
the
conversation
was
beginning
to
bore
me
but
young
harry
adams
explained
hawkins
with
gusto
and
his
former
wicked
look
returning
to
his
eyes
at
one
time
was
edward
only
rival
with
the
gals
he
was
a
young
fellow
got
a
commission
in
the
war
he
did
he
up
to
london
now
well
six
months
ago
young
harry
adams
come
staggerin
in
here
one
night
with
blood
runnin
from
his
face
and
neck
he
fell
down
in
that
seat
where
sitting
now
and
fainted
right
off
did
he
martin
we
had
to
send
young
jim
corder
what
used
to
come
here
in
them
days
off
runnin
all
the
way
past
leeways
for
the
doctor
ah
that
were
a
night
it
were
agreed
martin
same
as
edward
continued
the
narrator
young
harry
adams
would
say
a
word
about
what
happened
to
him
but
when
edward
first
see
him
all
over
he
laughed
till
the
pots
nearly
fell
off
the
hooks
he
did
little
did
he
guess
his
own
turn
was
to
come
my
interest
revived
then
in
the
case
of
er
adams
i
said
you
never
had
any
particulars
whatever
never
replied
martin
time
please
gentlemen
aye
said
hawkins
rising
time
it
be
well
good
night
sir
good
night
martin
good
night
hawkins
moved
towards
the
door
and
indeed
was
on
the
point
of
going
out
when
i
remembered
something
which
i
had
meant
to
ask
earlier
but
which
owing
to
lack
of
opportunity
i
had
postponed
asking
you
spoke
of
a
gift
or
keepsake
which
the
lady
from
london
gave
to
hines
i
said
i
think
you
mentioned
that
he
had
shown
it
to
you
i
am
rather
curious
about
this
story
might
i
ask
the
nature
of
the
gift
aye
to
be
sure
answered
hawkins
standing
half
in
shadow
on
the
step
of
the
rifle
on
shoulder
where
i
thought
he
made
a
very
wild
figure
brought
it
here
he
did
all
of
us
see
it
that
stuck
up
about
it
he
was
not
as
i
should
have
thought
much
of
it
if
a
party
had
give
it
to
me
i
do
say
then
what
was
it
why
it
were
a
little
figure
like
gold
said
it
were
but
brass
i
reckon
ugly
it
were
but
he
says
he
goin
to
wear
it
on
his
good
night
sir
he
turned
and
departed
but
what
kind
of
figure
i
called
after
him
out
of
the
darkness
his
voice
came
back
a
sort
of
a
sir
and
i
heard
his
outlandish
laughter
dying
away
in
the
distance
chapter
xii
i
dream
of
green
eyes
it
was
long
enough
before
sleep
visited
me
that
night
for
nearly
half
an
hour
i
stood
at
my
open
window
looking
across
a
slope
to
where
a
tower
projected
ghostly
above
the
fringe
of
the
woods
the
landlord
had
informed
me
that
it
was
friar
park
which
could
thus
be
seen
peeping
out
from
the
trees
and
as
i
stood
watching
that
sentinel
tower
a
thousand
strange
ideas
visited
me
the
curious
air
of
loneliness
of
which
i
had
become
conscious
at
the
moment
of
my
arrival
was
emphasized
now
that
the
residents
in
the
district
had
retired
to
their
scattered
habitations
no
sound
of
bird
or
beast
disturbed
the
silence
from
the
time
that
the
footsteps
of
martin
the
landlord
had
passed
my
door
as
he
mounted
heavily
to
his
no
sound
had
reached
me
but
the
muffled
ticking
of
a
grandfather
clock
upon
the
landing
outside
my
room
and
even
this
sound
the
only
one
intruding
upon
the
stillness
i
weaved
into
my
imaginings
so
that
presently
it
began
to
resemble
the
ticking
of
the
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
in
that
gruesome
room
at
the
red
house
the
view
which
i
commanded
was
an
extensive
one
and
although
in
the
clear
country
air
i
could
quite
easily
discern
the
upstanding
wing
of
friar
park
actually
the
house
and
the
park
were
some
two
miles
distant
where
the
park
ended
and
the
woods
began
it
was
impossible
to
determine
yet
such
was
my
curious
mood
that
i
lingered
there
endeavoring
to
puzzle
out
those
details
which
were
veiled
from
me
by
distance
i
thought
i
should
be
seeking
admittance
to
that
house
among
the
trees
in
fact
so
great
was
my
anxiety
to
plumb
the
depths
of
the
mystery
in
the
hope
of
recovering
some
new
fact
which
should
exculpate
coverly
that
nothing
but
the
unseemly
lateness
of
the
hour
had
deterred
me
from
presenting
myself
that
very
evening
yet
my
night
of
idleness
had
not
been
altogether
unfruitful
i
had
met
the
scarred
man
and
from
hawkins
i
had
heard
something
of
his
singular
story
now
as
i
stood
there
drinking
in
as
it
were
the
loneliness
of
the
prospect
my
thoughts
turned
for
the
hundredth
time
to
the
account
of
what
had
befallen
the
two
rustic
i
admit
that
the
concluding
part
of
hawkins
story
quite
evidently
regarded
by
him
as
a
detail
of
no
importance
had
hope
which
had
been
at
lowest
ebb
in
the
hour
of
my
arrival
although
it
was
possible
that
the
gift
of
a
sort
of
cat
to
young
edward
hines
might
prove
on
investigation
to
be
not
a
clew
but
a
i
preferred
to
think
that
fate
or
the
acute
reasoning
of
inspector
gatton
had
sent
me
down
to
this
quiet
country
for
a
good
purpose
and
i
built
great
hopes
around
the
figure
of
the
lady
down
from
london
indeed
it
appeared
to
me
that
there
were
more
lines
of
investigation
demanding
attention
than
alone
i
could
hope
to
deal
with
in
the
short
time
at
my
disposal
except
that
i
was
determined
to
visit
friar
park
early
on
the
following
day
i
scarcely
knew
in
which
direction
next
to
prosecute
my
inquiries
determining
that
i
should
be
to
sleep
on
the
problem
i
presently
turned
in
and
when
i
blew
out
the
candle
with
which
the
chambermaid
had
provided
me
i
remember
thinking
that
the
moonlight
was
so
bright
that
it
would
have
been
possible
to
read
moderately
large
type
without
inconvenience
i
slept
perhaps
for
two
hours
or
more
an
unrefreshing
sleep
disturbed
by
dreams
of
a
wildly
grotesque
nature
figures
increasingly
horrible
and
menacing
crowded
upon
me
but
that
which
proved
the
culminating
horror
and
which
finally
awakened
me
bathed
in
cold
perspiration
was
a
dream
of
two
huge
green
eyes
regarding
me
with
a
fixed
stare
fascinating
and
hypnotic
against
which
evil
power
i
fought
in
my
dream
with
all
the
strength
of
my
will
vaguely
defined
as
if
in
smoke
i
could
perceive
the
body
of
the
creature
to
which
these
incredible
eyes
belonged
it
was
slender
and
sinuous
and
sometimes
i
thought
it
to
be
that
of
a
human
being
and
sometimes
that
of
an
animal
for
at
one
moment
it
possessed
all
the
lines
of
a
woman
form
and
in
the
next
with
those
terrible
eyes
regarding
me
from
low
down
upon
the
ground
it
had
assumed
the
shape
of
a
crouching
beast
of
prey
this
fearsome
apparition
seemed
to
be
creeping
towards
me
nearer
and
nearer
and
was
about
to
spring
i
thought
when
i
awakened
as
i
have
said
and
sat
suddenly
upright
one
thing
i
immediately
perceived
which
may
have
accounted
for
my
bad
dreams
i
had
been
sleeping
with
the
moonlight
shining
directly
upon
my
face
another
thing
i
thought
i
perceived
but
endeavored
to
assure
myself
that
it
represented
the
aftermath
of
an
unpleasant
nightmare
this
was
a
lithe
shape
streaking
through
my
open
window
a
figment
of
the
imagination
as
i
concluded
at
the
time
the
of
a
dream
visibly
retreating
in
the
moment
of
awakening
so
of
this
did
i
become
that
i
did
not
get
up
to
investigate
the
matter
nor
was
there
any
sound
from
the
road
below
to
suggest
that
the
figure
had
been
otherwise
than
imaginary
yet
i
found
it
difficult
to
woo
slumber
again
and
for
nearly
an
hour
i
lay
tossing
from
side
to
side
listening
to
the
ticking
of
the
grandfather
clock
and
constantly
seeing
in
my
mind
eye
that
deserted
at
the
red
house
and
presently
as
i
lay
thus
i
became
aware
of
two
things
first
of
the
howling
of
dogs
and
second
of
a
sort
of
muttered
conversation
which
seemed
to
be
taking
place
somewhere
near
me
listening
intently
i
thought
i
could
distinguish
the
voice
of
a
man
and
that
of
a
woman
possibly
i
was
not
the
only
wakeful
inhabitant
of
the
abbey
inn
was
my
first
and
most
natural
idea
but
it
presently
became
apparent
to
me
that
the
speakers
were
not
in
the
inn
but
outside
in
the
road
curiosity
at
last
overcame
inclination
of
the
exact
time
i
was
not
aware
but
i
think
dawn
could
not
have
been
far
off
and
i
naturally
wondered
who
these
might
be
that
conversed
beneath
my
window
at
such
an
hour
i
rose
quietly
and
crept
across
the
room
endeavoring
to
avoid
showing
my
head
in
the
moonlight
by
the
exercise
of
a
little
ingenuity
i
obtained
a
view
of
the
road
before
the
inn
doors
at
first
i
was
unable
to
make
out
from
whence
this
muttered
conversation
arose
until
fixing
my
attention
upon
a
patch
of
shadow
underlying
a
tall
tree
which
stood
almost
immediately
opposite
the
window
i
presently
made
out
two
figures
there
somewhere
a
dog
was
howling
mournfully
for
a
long
time
i
failed
to
distinguish
any
more
than
indefinite
outlines
nor
throughout
the
murmured
colloquy
did
i
once
detect
even
so
much
as
a
phrase
the
night
remained
perfect
and
the
moon
possessed
a
tropical
brilliance
casting
deep
and
sharply
defined
shadows
and
lending
to
the
whole
visible
landscape
a
quality
of
hardness
which
for
some
obscure
reason
set
me
thinking
of
a
painting
by
wiertz
the
voices
continued
in
what
i
thought
was
a
dispute
something
in
the
voice
of
the
woman
although
i
could
only
hear
her
occasionally
piqued
yet
eluded
my
memory
but
it
was
the
voice
of
a
young
woman
whilst
that
of
the
man
suggested
a
foreigner
of
some
sort
and
one
past
youth
subconsciously
pursuing
the
wiertz
idea
i
know
not
why
i
invested
the
speakers
with
distinct
personalities
the
man
became
asmodeus
master
of
the
revels
at
the
black
sabbath
and
the
young
woman
i
cast
for
that
young
witch
depicted
in
one
of
the
canvasses
of
the
weird
belgian
genius
everything
in
the
black
and
silver
scene
seemed
to
fit
the
picture
here
was
the
unholy
tryst
and
i
pictured
the
distant
woods
peopled
with
gray
things
the
branches
burdened
with
winged
creatures
arisen
from
the
pit
the
darkness
a
curtain
with
luminous
eyes
and
it
was
my
recollection
of
that
phrase
from
a
work
on
sorcery
which
now
set
every
nerve
tingling
closely
i
peered
into
the
masking
shadow
telling
myself
that
i
was
the
victim
of
a
subjective
hallucination
if
this
was
indeed
the
case
or
if
what
i
saw
was
actual
i
must
leave
each
who
reads
to
determine
for
himself
and
the
episodes
which
follow
and
which
i
must
presently
relate
will
doubtless
aid
the
decision
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
for
one
fleeting
moment
luminous
eyes
indeed
the
darkness
from
out
of
the
shade
below
the
big
tree
they
regarded
me
greenly
and
i
saw
them
no
more
a
while
longer
i
watched
but
could
not
detect
any
evidence
of
movement
in
the
shadow
patch
the
voices
too
had
ceased
so
that
presently
it
occurred
to
me
that
the
speakers
must
have
withdrawn
along
a
narrow
lane
which
i
had
observed
during
the
evening
and
which
communicated
with
a
footpath
across
the
meadows
i
realized
that
my
heart
was
beating
with
extraordinary
rapidity
so
powerful
and
so
unpleasant
was
the
impression
made
upon
my
mind
by
this
possibly
trivial
incident
and
by
the
extraordinary
dream
which
had
preceded
it
that
on
returning
to
bed
and
despite
the
warmth
of
the
night
i
closed
both
lattices
and
drew
the
curtains
whether
as
a
result
of
thus
excluding
the
moonlight
or
because
of
some
other
reason
i
know
not
but
i
soon
fell
into
a
sound
sleep
from
which
i
did
not
awaken
until
the
chambermaid
knocked
at
the
door
at
eight
neither
did
i
experience
any
return
of
those
terrifying
nightmares
which
had
disturbed
my
slumbers
earlier
in
the
night
my
breakfast
despatched
i
smoked
a
pipe
on
the
bench
in
the
porch
and
martin
who
evidently
had
few
visitors
became
almost
communicative
undesirable
patrons
he
gave
me
to
understand
had
done
his
business
much
harm
by
dint
of
growls
and
several
winks
he
sought
to
enlighten
me
respecting
the
identity
of
these
tradekillers
but
i
was
no
wiser
on
the
point
at
the
end
of
his
exposition
than
i
had
been
at
the
beginning
things
ai
right
in
these
parts
he
concluded
and
thereupon
retired
within
doors
certainly
whatever
the
reason
might
be
the
village
even
in
broad
daylight
retained
that
indefinable
aspect
of
neglect
of
loneliness
many
of
the
cottages
were
of
very
early
date
and
many
were
empty
a
deserted
mill
stood
at
one
end
of
the
village
street
having
something
very
mournful
and
depressing
about
it
with
its
black
motionless
wings
outspread
against
the
blue
sky
like
those
of
a
great
bat
transfixed
there
were
meadows
no
great
way
from
the
village
but
these
i
learned
formed
part
of
the
property
of
farmer
hines
and
farmer
hines
was
counted
an
inhabitant
of
the
next
parish
it
was
then
this
particular
country
about
upper
crossleys
over
which
the
cloud
hung
and
i
wondered
if
the
district
had
been
one
of
those
growing
rare
nowadays
which
had
flourished
under
the
protection
of
the
big
house
and
had
decayed
with
the
decay
of
the
latter
it
had
been
a
common
enough
happening
in
the
old
days
and
i
felt
disposed
to
adopt
this
explanation
my
brief
survey
completed
then
i
returned
to
the
abbey
inn
for
my
stick
and
camera
and
set
out
forthwith
for
friar
park
from
certain
atmospherical
indications
which
i
had
observed
i
had
anticipated
a
return
of
the
electrical
storm
which
a
few
days
before
had
interrupted
the
extraordinary
and
now
as
i
left
the
village
behind
and
came
out
on
the
dusty
highroad
a
faint
breeze
greeted
me
and
afar
off
i
discerned
a
black
cloud
low
down
upon
the
distant
hills
chapter
xiii
damar
greefe
as
the
crow
flies
friar
park
was
less
than
two
miles
from
the
abbey
inn
but
the
road
which
according
to
a
led
to
hainingham
followed
a
tortuous
course
through
the
valley
and
when
at
last
i
came
to
what
i
assumed
to
be
the
a
thunderous
ebony
cloud
crested
the
above
and
its
edge
catching
the
burning
rays
of
the
sun
glowed
fiercely
like
the
pall
of
avalon
in
the
torchlight
through
the
dense
ranks
of
firs
cloaking
the
slopes
a
breeze
presaging
the
coming
storm
whispered
evilly
and
here
in
the
hollow
the
birds
were
still
i
stared
rather
blankly
at
the
lodge
which
if
appearances
were
to
be
trusted
was
unoccupied
but
i
pushed
open
the
iron
gate
and
tugged
at
a
ring
which
was
suspended
from
the
wall
a
discordant
clangor
rewarded
my
efforts
the
cracked
note
of
a
bell
which
spoke
from
somewhere
high
up
in
the
building
that
seemed
to
be
buffeted
to
and
fro
from
fir
to
fir
until
it
died
away
mournfully
in
some
place
of
shadows
far
up
the
slope
in
the
voice
of
the
bell
there
was
something
lonesome
something
akin
to
the
atmosphere
of
desertion
which
seemed
to
lie
upon
the
whole
neighborhood
something
fearful
too
as
though
the
bell
would
whisper
return
beware
of
disturbing
the
dwellers
in
this
place
the
house
one
wing
of
which
i
have
said
was
visible
from
the
inn
window
could
not
be
seen
at
all
from
the
gate
indeed
i
had
lost
sight
of
it
at
the
moment
that
i
had
set
out
and
had
never
obtained
a
glimpse
of
it
since
ten
minutes
before
i
had
inquired
the
way
from
a
whom
i
had
met
on
the
road
and
he
had
answered
me
with
a
curiosity
but
thinly
veiled
his
directions
had
been
characterized
by
that
rustic
vagueness
which
assumes
in
the
inquirer
an
intimate
knowledge
of
local
landmarks
but
nevertheless
i
believed
i
had
come
aright
i
gathered
from
its
name
that
friar
park
was
in
part
at
least
a
former
monastic
building
and
certainly
the
cracked
bell
spoke
with
the
voice
of
ancient
monasteries
and
had
in
it
the
hush
of
cloisters
and
the
sigh
of
renunciation
although
i
had
mentioned
nothing
of
the
purpose
of
my
journey
to
mine
host
of
the
abbey
inn
or
to
any
of
his
cronies
and
these
were
few
in
number
i
had
hoped
to
find
hawkins
at
the
lodge
and
a
second
time
i
awoke
the
ghostly
but
nothing
responded
to
its
call
man
bird
and
beast
had
seemingly
deserted
friar
park
faintly
i
detected
the
lowing
of
cattle
in
some
distant
pasture
the
ranks
of
firs
whispered
secretly
one
to
another
and
the
pall
above
the
hills
grew
blacker
and
began
to
stretch
out
over
the
valley
amid
this
ominous
stillness
of
nature
i
began
to
ascend
the
path
evidently
enough
the
extensive
grounds
had
been
neglected
for
years
and
that
few
pedestrians
and
fewer
vehicles
ever
sought
friar
park
was
demonstrated
by
the
presence
of
luxurious
weeds
in
the
having
proceeded
for
some
distance
until
the
sheer
hillside
seemed
to
loom
over
me
like
the
wall
of
a
tower
i
paused
peering
about
in
the
ever
growing
darkness
i
was
aware
of
a
physical
chill
certainly
no
ray
of
sunlight
ever
penetrated
to
this
tunnel
through
the
firs
could
i
have
mistaken
the
path
and
be
proceeding
not
towards
the
house
but
away
from
it
and
into
the
gloom
of
the
woods
or
perhaps
the
deserted
lodge
was
that
of
some
other
empty
establishment
there
was
something
uncomfortable
in
this
reflection
momentarily
i
knew
a
childish
fear
of
the
dim
groves
i
thought
of
the
darkness
with
luminous
eyes
and
i
walked
forward
rapidly
ten
paces
brought
me
to
one
of
the
many
bends
in
the
winding
road
and
there
far
ahead
as
though
out
of
some
cavern
in
the
very
hillside
a
yellow
light
shone
i
pressed
on
with
greater
assurance
until
the
house
became
visible
now
i
perceived
that
i
had
indeed
strayed
from
the
carriage
sweep
in
some
way
for
the
path
that
i
was
following
terminated
at
the
foot
of
a
short
flight
of
steps
i
mounted
the
steps
and
found
myself
at
the
bottom
of
a
terrace
the
main
entrance
was
far
to
my
left
and
separated
from
the
terrace
by
a
neglected
lawn
that
portion
of
the
place
was
hanoverian
and
ugly
whilst
the
wing
nearest
to
me
was
tudor
and
picturesque
excepting
the
yellow
light
shining
out
from
a
window
on
the
right
of
the
porch
no
illuminations
were
visible
about
the
house
although
the
brewing
storm
had
already
plunged
the
hollow
into
premature
night
my
conception
of
friar
park
had
been
wide
of
the
reality
and
there
was
no
sign
of
occupancy
about
this
mansion
which
might
have
hidden
forgotten
for
centuries
in
the
of
the
hills
the
stillness
of
the
place
was
of
that
sort
which
almost
seems
to
be
palpable
that
can
be
seen
and
felt
a
humid
chill
arose
apparently
from
the
terrace
with
its
stone
pavings
outlined
in
moss
and
crept
up
from
the
wilderness
below
and
down
from
the
fir
woods
above
i
had
crossed
the
terrace
and
the
lawn
and
now
stood
looking
through
the
open
french
window
from
which
light
had
proceeded
into
a
room
that
evidently
adjoined
the
hall
a
great
still
darkness
had
come
and
on
a
littered
table
in
this
room
a
was
burning
the
room
was
furnished
as
a
library
every
available
foot
of
wall
space
was
occupied
by
laden
bookcases
the
volumes
were
nearly
all
old
and
many
of
them
were
in
strange
evidently
foreign
bindings
items
of
chemical
apparatus
and
cases
of
specimens
were
visible
also
as
well
as
an
amazing
collection
of
egyptian
relics
strewn
about
the
place
in
the
utmost
disorder
at
the
table
a
man
was
seated
deep
in
study
of
a
huge
volume
he
was
strangely
gaunt
and
apparently
very
tall
his
face
resembled
that
of
anubis
the
god
of
ancient
egypt
and
his
hair
which
was
growing
white
he
wore
long
and
brushed
back
from
his
bony
brow
his
skin
was
of
a
dull
even
yellow
color
and
his
long
thin
brown
hands
betrayed
to
me
the
fact
that
the
man
was
a
eurasian
the
crunching
of
a
piece
of
gravel
under
foot
revealed
my
presence
the
man
looked
up
swiftly
i
started
those
black
eyes
were
truly
in
their
dark
intensity
of
gaze
and
the
uncanny
resemblance
to
anubis
was
heightened
by
them
more
than
ever
convinced
that
i
had
made
a
mistake
forgive
me
for
so
rudely
disturbing
you
i
said
but
i
was
under
the
impression
that
this
was
friar
park
whereas
i
fear
i
have
trespassed
the
intense
gaze
never
left
my
face
for
a
moment
but
there
is
no
trespass
answered
the
man
at
the
table
speaking
in
a
high
harsh
voice
and
with
a
marked
but
evasive
accent
all
visitors
are
welcome
chance
ones
or
otherwise
but
you
have
certainly
lost
your
way
this
is
the
bell
house
and
am
i
far
from
friar
park
no
great
distance
may
i
ask
if
lady
coverly
knew
of
your
proposed
visit
she
did
not
i
said
with
surprise
then
i
fear
your
journey
has
been
fruitless
she
is
an
invalid
and
can
receive
no
one
there
was
something
peremptory
and
imperious
in
his
manner
which
i
resented
and
evidently
perceiving
this
resentment
i
am
lady
coverly
medical
adviser
added
the
eurasian
possibly
i
can
afford
you
some
assistance
in
any
event
i
fear
you
will
have
to
accept
my
poor
hospitality
for
the
nonce
the
alternative
is
a
drenching
even
as
he
spoke
the
hollow
was
illuminated
by
a
blinding
flash
of
lightning
and
indeed
his
last
words
were
drowned
in
the
thunder
that
boomed
and
crashed
in
deepening
peals
over
the
hills
in
a
sudden
tropical
torrent
the
rain
descended
and
i
stepped
forward
into
the
room
its
occupant
rose
to
his
great
height
to
greet
me
i
am
damar
greefe
he
said
and
bowed
formally
i
made
myself
known
to
him
in
turn
and
with
a
sort
of
stately
courtesy
he
set
a
chair
for
me
and
himself
resumed
his
former
seat
you
are
a
stranger
to
this
neighborhood
i
gather
he
continued
now
in
spite
of
his
polished
courtesy
there
was
that
about
damar
greefe
which
i
did
not
and
could
not
like
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
gentleman
but
the
face
was
a
mask
a
mask
of
anubis
and
seated
there
in
that
strange
untidy
apartment
amid
varied
relics
of
the
past
and
obscure
experiments
possibly
designed
to
pry
into
the
future
whilst
thunder
boomed
high
over
the
bell
house
i
determined
to
withhold
from
damar
greefe
the
true
nature
of
my
mission
in
fact
already
i
regretted
having
told
him
my
name
although
to
have
given
a
fictitious
one
would
have
been
a
gross
violation
of
hospitality
unhesitatingly
offered
even
now
i
find
it
hard
to
explain
the
mingled
sentiments
which
claimed
me
on
the
occasion
of
this
my
first
meeting
with
a
very
singular
man
i
am
taking
a
brief
rest
cure
i
replied
and
as
i
am
given
to
understand
that
friar
park
is
of
much
historical
interest
i
had
purposed
seeking
permission
to
look
over
the
place
and
if
possible
to
take
a
few
photographs
damar
greefe
inclined
his
head
gravely
a
former
monastic
house
addison
he
replied
and
as
you
say
of
great
archæological
interest
but
the
regrettably
poor
health
of
lady
coverly
makes
it
impossible
for
her
to
entertain
visitors
something
in
the
tone
of
his
voice
which
now
he
had
lowered
so
that
some
of
its
natural
harshness
was
disguised
set
me
wondering
where
i
had
heard
it
before
it
needed
no
further
scrutiny
of
the
hawk
face
to
convince
me
that
i
had
never
hitherto
met
damar
greefe
but
i
certainly
believed
that
i
had
previously
heard
his
voice
although
i
quite
failed
to
recall
where
and
under
what
circumstances
sir
burnham
has
been
dead
for
several
years
i
believe
i
asked
tentatively
for
several
years
yes
without
returning
to
the
peremptory
tone
which
had
distinguished
his
earlier
manner
damar
greefe
coldly
but
courteously
blocked
my
path
to
discussion
of
the
coverly
family
and
after
several
abortive
attempts
to
draw
him
out
upon
the
point
i
recognized
this
deliberate
design
and
abandoned
the
matter
the
storm
was
moving
westward
and
although
brilliant
flashes
of
lightning
several
times
lighted
up
the
queer
room
gleaming
upon
the
lid
of
an
egyptian
sarcophagus
or
throwing
into
horrid
relief
some
anatomical
specimen
in
one
of
the
cases
the
thunder
crashed
no
more
over
the
house
but
its
booming
reached
my
ears
from
away
upon
a
remote
spur
of
the
hills
i
became
aware
of
a
growing
uneasiness
in
the
company
of
my
chance
host
who
sat
by
the
oddly
littered
table
watching
me
with
those
birdlike
eyes
surely
i
said
the
rain
has
ceased
temporarily
he
replied
glancing
toward
the
terrace
but
i
should
advise
you
to
delay
a
few
minutes
longer
there
is
every
threat
of
a
concluding
downpour
to
come
ere
long
many
thanks
i
returned
i
risk
it
i
have
already
trespassed
unwarrantably
upon
your
time
greefe
it
was
good
of
you
to
give
me
shelter
he
rose
a
tall
thin
figure
vaguely
repellent
upon
realizing
that
i
was
set
on
departure
and
conducted
me
out
by
way
of
the
front
door
standing
in
the
porch
at
any
time
that
you
chance
to
be
again
in
my
neighborhood
addison
he
said
i
beg
of
you
to
call
i
have
few
visitors
by
what
process
whether
of
reasoning
or
intuition
i
came
to
the
conclusion
i
know
not
but
as
i
turned
the
bend
of
the
drive
and
saw
the
deserted
lodge
ahead
i
knew
beyond
any
possibility
of
doubt
that
damar
greefe
had
not
returned
to
his
studies
but
had
swiftly
passed
along
some
path
through
the
trees
so
as
to
head
me
off
his
purpose
in
so
doing
i
knew
not
but
that
he
had
cherished
this
purpose
and
proposed
to
act
upon
it
i
had
divined
in
some
way
at
the
moment
that
i
had
left
him
in
the
porch
now
hastening
my
steps
i
began
to
wonder
if
his
design
was
to
intercept
me
or
merely
to
watch
which
way
i
should
turn
on
gaining
the
main
road
that
it
was
the
latter
i
presently
learned
for
although
my
unpleasant
imagination
pictured
the
gaunt
figure
lurking
amid
the
shadows
which
hemmed
me
in
i
played
the
part
of
innocence
and
never
once
looked
back
coming
out
into
the
highroad
i
turned
sharply
left
retracing
the
route
by
which
i
had
come
to
the
eurasian
doctor
abode
if
he
had
suspected
that
i
had
intended
to
call
at
friar
park
despite
his
assurance
that
such
a
visit
would
prove
futile
then
he
was
disappointed
a
new
and
strange
theory
to
account
for
the
mystery
had
presented
itself
to
me
a
horrible
theory
yet
so
far
as
my
present
data
went
a
feasible
one
above
all
i
realized
that
i
had
committed
a
strategical
error
in
openly
seeking
an
interview
with
lady
coverly
but
i
had
not
when
i
had
formed
that
plan
known
of
the
existence
of
damar
greefe
i
uttered
a
sigh
of
relief
upon
emerging
upon
the
highroad
the
certainty
that
the
eurasian
was
dogging
me
through
the
trees
was
an
unpleasant
one
and
now
i
perceived
that
several
courses
presented
themselves
but
first
i
must
obtain
more
information
i
perceived
a
mystery
within
a
mystery
for
i
was
not
likely
to
forget
that
in
damar
greefe
collection
i
had
noted
a
number
of
chapter
xiv
the
black
doctor
my
mail
neatly
readdressed
by
coates
was
awaiting
me
when
i
returned
to
the
abbey
inn
the
postal
deliveries
in
upper
crossleys
were
eccentric
and
unreliable
but
having
glanced
through
the
cuttings
enclosed
i
partook
of
a
hasty
lunch
and
sat
down
to
the
task
of
preparing
a
column
for
the
which
should
not
deflect
public
interest
from
the
known
central
figures
in
the
tragedy
but
which
at
the
same
time
should
hint
at
new
developments
many
times
in
the
intervals
of
writing
i
glanced
through
my
open
window
across
the
valley
to
where
the
upstanding
wing
of
friar
park
jutted
above
the
trees
strange
and
terrible
ideas
flocked
to
my
mind
ideas
which
must
be
carefully
excluded
from
the
article
but
at
last
the
manuscript
was
completed
and
i
determined
to
walk
into
the
neighboring
town
some
miles
distant
to
post
it
and
at
the
same
time
to
despatch
a
code
telegram
to
inspector
gatton
the
long
walk
did
me
good
helping
me
to
clear
my
mind
of
morbid
vapors
therefore
my
business
finished
and
immune
from
suspicion
in
my
character
of
a
london
pedestrian
i
set
out
to
obtain
that
vital
information
which
i
lacked
a
natural
taciturnity
rendered
mine
host
of
the
abbey
inn
a
difficult
subject
for
interrogation
moreover
that
patriarchal
outlook
which
had
been
evidenced
in
his
attitude
towards
the
uncouth
edward
hines
clearly
enough
deterred
him
from
imparting
to
me
any
facts
detrimental
to
the
good
name
of
upper
crossleys
but
on
the
highroad
and
just
before
entering
the
outskirts
of
the
little
country
town
i
had
observed
an
inn
which
had
seemed
to
be
well
patronized
by
the
local
folks
and
since
your
typical
country
is
a
for
the
gossip
of
the
neighborhood
to
the
threshers
i
made
my
way
the
doors
had
only
just
been
opened
nevertheless
as
i
set
my
foot
upon
the
step
i
met
the
very
gossip
that
i
sought
hope
you
was
caught
in
the
shower
this
morning
sir
said
an
old
man
seated
solitary
in
an
armchair
in
the
corner
of
the
but
the
country
be
all
the
better
for
the
rain
he
eyed
me
and
there
many
a
fine
walk
hereabouts
he
averred
there
lots
comes
down
from
london
especially
of
a
sunday
no
doubt
said
i
encouragingly
stepping
up
to
the
counter
there
continued
the
ancient
you
can
see
the
sea
from
there
in
clear
weather
and
many
the
time
in
the
war
heard
the
guns
in
france
from
upper
crowbury
of
a
still
night
then
four
mile
away
there
the
old
friar
park
though
nobody
allowed
past
the
gate
not
as
nobody
wants
to
be
he
added
reflectively
how
is
that
i
understood
that
friar
park
was
of
great
interest
oh
ah
murmured
my
acquaintance
oh
ah
maybe
you
was
thinkin
of
lookin
over
it
like
i
was
yes
oh
ah
well
there
some
likes
a
bit
o
danger
danger
i
echoed
to
what
danger
do
you
refer
he
surveyed
me
with
cunning
old
rheumy
eyes
and
what
about
he
inquired
ai
dangerous
and
what
about
can
make
a
party
feel
sick
they
oh
ah
but
i
exclaimed
you
surely
do
mean
that
there
are
traps
laid
in
the
grounds
of
the
park
it
is
legal
and
why
should
any
one
shoot
at
visitors
maybe
they
told
to
he
shouted
aye
that
the
reason
as
like
as
not
they
told
to
who
are
old
gipsy
hawkins
as
used
to
be
sir
burnham
what
he
doin
of
up
there
at
park
all
day
layin
traps
and
such
that
what
he
doin
of
my
son
jim
knows
it
he
do
my
son
jim
found
one
of
and
left
best
part
of
a
pair
of
trousers
in
it
too
these
statements
if
true
would
seem
to
cast
an
unpleasant
sidelight
upon
the
character
of
my
acquaintance
of
the
abbey
inn
i
wondered
if
the
jim
referred
to
was
that
young
jim
corder
whose
name
seemed
to
be
a
standing
joke
with
the
man
hawkins
i
learned
later
that
it
was
so
and
i
wondered
if
martin
mysterious
references
to
certain
patrons
whose
patronage
had
damaged
his
business
might
not
have
referred
to
the
moreover
i
now
put
a
new
construction
upon
hawkins
sly
amusement
when
i
had
inquired
about
the
shooting
in
the
neighborhood
i
began
to
grow
keenly
interested
and
surely
you
took
some
steps
in
the
matter
i
asked
oh
ah
my
son
jim
did
he
lay
for
days
for
that
there
gipsy
hawkins
but
hawkins
was
too
wise
for
him
but
said
i
you
could
legally
have
claimed
damages
maybe
was
the
reply
but
i
reckon
they
have
asked
what
my
son
jim
was
doing
in
the
park
oh
ah
i
reckon
they
would
this
point
of
view
had
not
hitherto
presented
itself
to
me
but
that
it
was
a
just
one
i
did
not
doubt
what
is
the
object
of
all
this
i
asked
does
lady
coverly
object
to
any
one
entering
the
grounds
lady
coverly
confided
the
old
man
it
that
there
black
doctor
what
black
doctor
i
exclaimed
him
they
call
doctor
greefe
oh
said
i
you
call
him
the
black
doctor
is
he
a
negro
he
black
was
the
reply
black
he
is
although
his
hair
is
white
oh
ah
there
black
blood
in
him
all
right
and
what
has
he
to
do
with
the
in
the
park
has
put
there
has
put
there
he
does
but
what
for
surely
the
property
belongs
not
to
greefe
but
to
lady
coverly
belongs
to
her
her
own
soul
do
belong
to
her
i
was
conscious
of
a
growing
excitement
i
thought
that
i
was
about
to
learn
the
very
fact
which
i
was
seeking
and
accordingly
what
is
the
age
of
lady
burnham
coverly
i
asked
lady
burnham
well
let
me
see
she
were
not
about
i
reckon
when
sir
burnham
first
brought
her
to
the
park
them
was
the
days
them
was
these
parts
changed
cruel
since
i
was
a
young
man
then
it
was
soon
after
as
sir
burnham
went
off
to
egypt
for
government
and
eleven
years
afore
he
come
back
again
did
lady
burnham
accompany
him
to
egypt
i
asked
interestedly
oh
ah
for
sure
she
did
poor
roger
was
born
in
egypt
it
was
eight
years
come
october
they
returned
home
to
park
and
six
years
come
september
poor
young
roger
died
then
lady
coverly
must
be
something
over
forty
years
of
age
said
i
musingly
one
of
my
theories
a
wild
one
i
must
confess
was
shattered
by
this
piece
of
information
in
short
i
had
conceived
the
idea
and
the
news
that
lady
coverly
had
resided
for
some
years
in
egypt
had
strengthened
it
that
the
woman
in
the
case
was
none
other
than
the
mistress
of
friar
park
her
antipathy
towards
the
late
baronet
had
seemed
to
suggest
a
motive
for
the
crime
but
it
was
impossible
to
reconcile
the
figure
of
this
lonely
and
bereaved
woman
with
that
of
the
supernormally
agile
visitant
to
my
cottage
in
london
in
short
with
the
possessor
of
those
dreadful
green
eyes
i
determined
to
try
a
new
tack
and
remembering
that
the
real
object
of
my
journey
to
upper
crossleys
was
to
learn
particulars
respecting
the
early
death
of
roger
coverly
did
roger
coverly
die
in
england
i
inquired
oh
no
sir
he
died
in
foreign
parts
but
they
brought
him
home
to
bury
him
they
did
do
you
know
of
what
he
died
oh
ah
i
have
heard
tell
it
was
some
foreign
fever
like
took
him
off
sudden
and
him
only
a
lad
it
killed
poor
sir
burnham
it
did
then
sir
burnham
died
shortly
afterwards
two
years
afterwards
and
these
parts
has
never
been
the
same
since
but
what
has
greefe
to
do
with
all
this
ah
now
you
asking
seven
years
ago
he
settled
here
in
the
big
house
up
by
the
park
part
of
the
park
estate
it
is
and
there
been
ever
since
him
and
his
black
servant
black
servant
i
exclaimed
oh
ah
real
black
he
is
not
like
his
master
but
as
black
as
a
lump
o
coal
an
ugly
oh
ah
he
ugly
right
enough
goes
up
to
the
abbey
inn
of
a
night
he
do
him
and
that
there
gipsy
hawkins
the
prettiest
pair
o
rascals
in
upper
crossleys
drove
all
the
decent
folk
away
from
the
place
and
martin
keeps
the
best
beer
about
here
too
if
i
was
martin
continued
the
ancient
truculently
i
know
what
to
say
to
them
two
i
would
aye
and
what
to
do
to
he
added
with
great
ferocity
oh
said
i
for
this
unexpected
clearing
up
of
so
many
minor
mysteries
had
rather
taken
me
aback
then
greefe
is
not
popular
popular
echoed
the
old
man
he
drained
his
tankard
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
with
a
bang
he
been
the
ruin
o
these
parts
he
has
he
worse
than
the
but
in
what
way
is
he
responsible
for
these
evils
of
which
you
complain
the
old
man
peered
into
his
empty
mug
with
a
glance
of
such
eloquence
that
i
could
not
mistake
its
import
accordingly
i
caused
it
to
be
refilled
thus
preventing
any
check
in
the
flow
of
his
eloquence
and
in
what
way
he
asked
his
voice
raised
in
a
high
quavering
note
he
laughed
and
his
laughter
was
pitched
in
the
same
key
that
doctor
is
a
blot
on
the
country
when
sir
burnham
was
alive
and
afore
he
went
to
egypt
it
was
different
although
mind
you
it
my
belief
oh
ah
it
is
indeed
that
him
coming
here
had
as
much
to
do
with
sir
burnham
death
as
the
loss
of
his
son
what
i
told
you
about
that
my
belief
i
took
a
sip
from
my
replenished
mug
and
i
can
not
understand
i
said
why
the
presence
of
greefe
should
have
brought
about
the
death
of
sir
burnham
or
the
death
of
anybody
else
no
said
the
old
man
cunningly
you
ca
eh
well
there
be
things
none
of
us
can
understand
and
things
some
of
us
can
if
you
ever
clap
eyes
on
that
there
black
doctor
like
enough
this
be
one
of
the
things
you
be
able
to
understand
with
the
idea
of
drawing
yet
more
intimate
confidences
you
suggest
that
greefe
had
some
hold
upon
the
late
sir
burnham
i
do
suggest
nothing
some
hold
upon
lady
burnham
then
oh
ah
like
enough
do
think
i
added
solicitously
that
i
doubt
the
truth
of
your
statements
in
any
way
but
what
could
this
black
doctor
as
you
call
him
have
to
gain
by
persecuting
these
people
there
be
things
replied
my
aged
friend
what
none
of
us
can
understand
but
there
be
things
that
all
of
us
do
oh
ah
there
be
and
all
of
us
in
these
parts
knows
as
upper
crossleys
ai
been
the
same
since
that
black
doctor
settled
here
besides
first
roger
went
then
sir
burnham
went
now
i
do
read
in
this
paper
as
another
of
is
gone
he
held
up
two
gnarled
and
twitching
fingers
crossed
before
him
did
you
ever
hear
tell
of
the
evil
eye
he
asked
and
peered
at
me
cunningly
he
took
a
long
drink
from
his
mug
but
maybe
you
laugh
at
he
added
i
am
in
no
way
disposed
to
laugh
at
anything
you
have
told
me
i
assured
him
and
as
to
the
evil
eye
i
have
certainly
heard
of
such
a
thing
although
i
must
admit
and
i
am
glad
to
admit
that
i
have
never
met
with
it
i
do
trust
sir
responded
the
ancient
that
such
a
gent
may
never
meet
with
it
ah
i
do
trust
that
you
never
may
which
is
to
say
so
to
speak
as
i
do
trust
as
you
never
meet
that
black
doctor
if
ever
a
man
had
the
evil
eye
that
black
doctor
got
it
and
old
mother
shale
what
lives
in
the
cottage
on
the
heath
down
against
the
windmill
she
warned
me
she
did
three
days
after
he
come
here
corder
she
says
black
doctor
has
the
evil
eye
and
never
was
a
truer
word
spoke
he
been
the
bane
and
blight
of
this
place
he
has
he
paused
from
sheer
lack
of
breath
and
having
allowed
him
some
little
interval
of
repose
but
what
has
the
evil
eye
to
do
with
the
laying
of
and
the
shooting
of
visitors
who
may
chance
to
cross
the
estate
i
inquired
ah
that
it
but
the
evil
eye
i
told
goes
with
the
evil
heart
and
that
man
heart
as
black
as
his
face
blacker
he
added
on
second
thoughts
yet
you
have
no
positive
evidence
that
greefe
is
responsible
for
the
setting
of
these
and
the
attitude
of
hawkins
nobody
has
declared
my
acquaintance
earnestly
if
anybody
had
we
have
had
the
law
on
him
long
ago
and
is
lady
burnham
often
seen
about
i
inquired
never
was
the
reply
she
ai
passed
the
gates
of
the
park
this
twelve
months
and
more
he
looked
about
him
covertly
and
it
my
belief
he
affirmed
lowering
his
quavering
voice
almost
to
a
whisper
that
she
never
pass
them
gates
again
alive
oh
said
i
this
seems
to
be
a
very
cheerful
neighborhood
yet
in
spite
of
your
wishes
on
my
behalf
i
must
confess
i
should
like
a
glimpse
of
this
black
doctor
does
he
practice
about
here
practice
is
it
likely
then
he
has
private
means
his
house
belongs
to
the
estate
was
the
reply
and
you
ca
tell
me
he
ever
pays
any
rent
as
to
his
means
i
do
know
nothing
about
that
i
gathered
little
more
of
interest
from
my
acquaintance
of
the
threshers
but
indeed
i
had
gathered
enough
and
as
i
wended
my
way
back
to
the
abbey
inn
i
was
turning
over
in
my
mind
the
extraordinary
story
that
he
had
related
to
me
concerning
damar
greefe
clearly
the
man
lived
the
life
of
a
pariah
and
i
knew
not
whether
to
pity
him
or
otherwise
in
an
ignorant
community
it
is
a
dreadful
thing
to
earn
such
a
reputation
as
that
which
evidently
attached
to
the
eurasian
doctor
and
this
talk
of
the
evil
eye
took
me
back
automatically
to
the
early
days
of
this
quaint
spot
where
cut
off
from
the
larger
things
of
life
the
simple
folk
continued
to
hold
the
same
beliefs
which
had
stirred
their
forefathers
in
those
remote
times
when
the
white
brethren
from
the
neighboring
abbey
had
held
absolute
sway
in
that
the
life
history
of
one
accused
as
damar
greefe
was
now
accused
of
possessing
the
evil
eye
would
very
probably
have
terminated
upon
a
pile
of
faggots
by
order
of
mother
church
it
was
all
very
strange
and
apart
from
its
importance
in
the
eyes
of
the
ignorant
country
folk
seemed
to
contain
a
nucleus
of
something
more
germane
to
the
object
of
my
mission
than
the
imaginings
of
ancient
sorcery
which
still
lingered
in
the
minds
of
the
people
of
upper
crossleys
i
thought
how
i
had
looked
out
of
my
window
and
had
found
in
the
landscape
something
which
had
translated
my
ideas
to
that
strange
picture
of
wiertz
then
i
had
known
nothing
of
this
nebula
of
witchcraft
which
according
to
popular
tradition
rested
upon
the
vicinity
yet
i
had
pictured
the
night
as
a
curtain
with
luminous
eyes
and
i
could
only
suppose
that
my
mind
had
become
impressed
by
a
picture
conjured
up
by
this
focusing
of
local
thought
in
short
the
people
of
the
neighborhood
had
created
this
atmosphere
of
desolation
and
of
something
more
sinister
which
i
had
observed
in
the
very
hour
of
my
arrival
at
the
little
village
so
my
thoughts
ran
as
i
proceeded
back
to
the
abbey
inn
and
as
i
had
collected
much
new
and
valuable
information
i
determined
to
embody
it
in
a
long
report
to
gatton
furthermore
i
was
doubtful
as
to
my
next
step
the
bold
move
which
i
made
later
not
having
yet
presented
itself
to
my
mind
twice
during
the
evening
however
i
looked
into
the
but
neither
gipsy
hawkins
nor
the
black
servant
appeared
but
when
at
last
i
turned
in
i
closed
my
windows
and
drew
the
curtains
i
desired
no
repetition
of
the
dreams
which
had
made
hideous
my
first
night
at
the
abbey
inn
chapter
xv
i
receive
visitors
over
my
breakfast
on
the
following
morning
i
began
to
formulate
that
plan
which
was
to
lead
to
an
extraordinary
discovery
i
breakfasted
in
my
own
room
and
just
as
i
had
finished
and
was
about
to
light
my
pipe
martin
the
landlord
knocked
at
the
door
come
in
i
cried
he
entered
and
a
lady
has
called
to
see
you
sir
he
announced
the
manner
in
which
he
made
the
statement
evidenced
a
curious
mixture
of
disapproval
and
respect
for
my
own
part
it
is
perhaps
unnecessary
for
me
to
say
that
my
first
thought
as
always
was
isobel
in
the
very
moment
however
that
this
idea
visited
me
the
wish
being
father
of
the
thought
i
recognized
its
folly
a
lady
i
repeated
but
i
know
no
one
here
are
you
certain
that
it
was
for
me
she
asked
quite
sir
replied
the
landlord
who
was
evidently
flurried
out
of
his
usual
calm
by
what
i
gathered
to
be
an
episode
unprecedented
in
his
memories
of
the
abbey
inn
addison
she
asked
for
she
is
waiting
in
the
sir
wholly
at
a
loss
to
understand
who
my
visitor
could
be
i
made
my
way
to
the
little
apartment
at
the
side
of
the
which
martin
had
dignified
with
the
title
of
i
observed
upon
the
bench
before
the
door
a
fellow
whom
i
might
have
taken
to
be
some
local
tradesman
except
that
he
appeared
to
be
a
chance
visitor
and
was
evidently
unacquainted
with
martin
he
was
reading
a
newspaper
and
i
saw
a
cup
of
coffee
set
upon
the
bench
beside
him
this
was
a
hazy
morning
which
i
thought
betokened
another
hot
day
and
as
i
entered
the
i
found
it
to
be
pervaded
by
a
curious
not
unlike
that
of
summer
twilight
the
glow
of
the
sun
peering
redly
through
the
mist
added
warmth
to
this
soft
illumination
but
since
the
room
boasted
only
one
small
window
it
was
badly
lighted
even
at
noon
from
a
little
sofa
set
before
this
window
my
visitor
rose
to
greet
me
and
with
my
hand
upon
the
knob
of
the
door
i
paused
for
certainly
this
was
a
stranger
who
stood
before
me
she
was
tall
and
very
slender
attired
with
great
elegance
and
in
her
whole
appearance
there
was
something
markedly
foreign
or
perhaps
i
should
say
exotic
she
wore
a
small
hat
which
i
judged
to
be
parisian
and
expensive
and
from
its
brim
depended
a
figured
veil
which
effectually
disguised
her
features
without
being
able
or
perhaps
without
being
intended
to
disguise
her
brilliant
eyes
for
one
moment
a
dreadful
idea
presented
itself
to
me
but
the
most
appalling
memory
which
i
retained
of
those
other
around
which
so
much
mystery
clustered
was
their
brilliant
greenness
the
eyes
of
my
visitor
although
unusually
large
and
brilliant
were
totally
different
in
shape
being
long
and
narrow
and
apparently
of
a
wonderful
amber
color
when
she
spoke
her
voice
was
very
cultured
and
soft
yet
i
started
and
i
know
i
must
have
been
staring
very
hard
and
very
rudely
there
was
a
faint
huskiness
in
its
tone
a
caress
in
its
accents
which
irresistibly
reminded
me
of
the
scene
in
my
study
which
had
resulted
in
the
loss
of
the
image
of
bâst
i
think
i
have
already
indicated
that
i
am
one
of
those
who
arrive
at
a
decision
somewhat
laboriously
and
now
convinced
that
my
memory
of
the
luminous
eyes
was
threatening
to
become
an
obsession
so
that
i
looked
to
find
them
blazing
out
at
me
from
the
face
of
every
stranger
whom
i
encountered
i
forced
myself
to
believe
that
a
chance
resemblance
in
my
visitor
voice
to
the
voice
of
that
other
visitor
had
tricked
me
addison
she
said
i
afraid
you
will
think
this
call
somewhat
unconventional
but
she
paused
almost
imperceptibly
i
am
staying
at
friar
park
and
lady
coverly
has
heard
from
greefe
that
you
wish
to
see
the
house
really
i
murmured
it
was
good
of
you
to
take
so
much
trouble
but
it
was
no
trouble
at
all
she
declared
i
had
occasion
to
come
this
way
and
lady
coverly
asked
me
to
call
and
tell
you
that
whilst
she
is
not
well
enough
to
receive
visitors
you
are
quite
welcome
to
inspect
the
older
parts
of
the
house
i
am
much
indebted
i
said
having
so
spoken
i
ceased
and
was
aware
of
a
kind
of
embarrassment
for
whilst
i
was
naturally
anxious
to
avoid
unpleasant
suspicions
regarding
a
lady
who
apparently
had
gone
out
of
her
way
to
perform
an
act
of
courtesy
yet
i
could
not
place
this
elegant
figure
in
the
household
of
friar
park
as
that
household
had
been
depicted
by
my
old
gossip
of
the
threshers
i
mentally
determined
there
and
then
to
question
martin
and
if
possible
hawkins
upon
the
point
directly
an
opportunity
arose
and
the
former
immediately
my
visitor
had
departed
but
she
seemed
to
be
in
no
hurry
to
depart
you
have
never
visited
this
neighborhood
before
she
continued
in
the
soft
caressing
voice
which
persistently
awakened
memories
of
that
evening
in
my
cottage
she
herself
upon
the
sofa
leaving
me
no
alternative
but
to
sit
down
in
the
only
chair
which
the
boasted
i
could
not
fail
to
notice
however
that
although
she
addressed
me
as
addison
she
did
not
volunteer
her
own
name
furthermore
she
remained
throughout
with
her
back
to
the
window
never
i
replied
it
is
very
interesting
in
many
ways
i
believe
you
will
find
friar
park
most
fascinating
she
assured
me
it
stands
upon
the
site
of
one
of
the
oldest
and
largest
monasteries
in
the
south
of
england
indeed
some
parts
of
the
house
notably
the
chapel
and
the
west
tower
which
is
visible
from
here
i
think
are
remains
of
the
original
building
she
was
palpably
trying
to
interest
me
and
conscious
that
my
somewhat
frigid
attitude
was
churlish
if
she
was
really
what
she
professed
to
be
namely
a
friend
of
lady
coverly
i
endeavored
in
turn
to
display
an
intelligent
interest
in
the
history
of
the
old
monastic
house
i
do
not
regret
that
i
did
so
i
think
that
i
have
never
heard
the
dry
bones
of
history
clothed
so
fascinatingly
the
knowledge
displayed
by
my
unknown
visitor
of
the
history
of
that
old
monkish
corner
of
england
was
truly
amazing
the
coverlys
it
appeared
had
played
their
part
in
that
history
right
back
to
the
misty
times
of
saxon
england
the
scenes
conjured
up
by
my
first
sight
of
the
curiously
wild
country
which
lay
between
the
village
and
the
distant
parkland
were
presented
now
with
all
the
color
and
truth
of
real
life
this
woman
seemingly
was
acquainted
with
almost
every
act
of
importance
of
every
coverly
since
the
days
of
canute
and
with
the
doings
of
all
the
abbots
who
had
ever
ruled
over
finally
while
i
listened
in
ever
growing
wonder
fascinated
by
the
extent
of
this
strange
woman
knowledge
and
in
part
too
by
the
husky
music
of
her
voice
she
seemed
to
become
conscious
of
the
passage
of
time
and
rising
suddenly
she
laughed
and
her
laughter
again
awakened
a
memory
how
perfectly
absurd
of
me
mr
addison
she
said
you
will
certainly
think
i
am
more
than
eccentric
to
sit
here
fulfilling
the
part
of
a
local
guide
even
as
she
spoke
the
words
a
sound
intruded
from
the
road
outside
a
heavy
footstep
came
first
the
footstep
of
one
who
approached
the
door
of
the
inn
then
martin
i
heard
a
moment
please
it
was
damar
greefe
if
the
sound
of
his
voice
had
startled
me
its
effect
upon
my
visitor
was
truly
singular
taking
a
swift
step
towards
me
she
grasped
my
arm
with
her
strangely
slender
gloved
hand
now
that
she
stood
so
close
to
me
i
realized
that
she
was
even
taller
than
i
had
supposed
nearly
as
tall
as
myself
in
fact
her
swift
lithe
movements
possessed
an
indescribable
grace
which
as
i
thought
and
experienced
a
sudden
revulsion
were
oddly
uncanny
oh
addison
she
said
and
drew
even
nearer
so
that
i
could
feel
her
breath
upon
my
cheek
i
fear
that
man
as
one
fears
a
snake
i
am
going
to
ask
a
favor
of
you
i
see
that
there
is
another
door
to
this
room
and
i
have
a
particular
reason
for
wishing
to
avoid
him
i
do
know
where
that
doorway
leads
to
but
i
can
doubtless
find
my
way
out
her
grasp
upon
my
arm
tightened
dare
i
ask
you
she
added
pleadingly
to
conceal
from
him
if
necessary
the
fact
that
i
have
been
here
but
martin
knows
that
you
have
been
here
i
protested
my
mind
in
a
whirl
at
this
sudden
turn
of
affairs
and
the
man
sitting
on
the
bench
outside
must
have
seen
you
come
in
also
he
did
not
she
replied
rapidly
and
martin
does
not
know
who
i
am
it
was
on
the
tip
of
my
tongue
to
say
neither
do
i
but
please
she
pleaded
it
is
not
much
to
ask
but
it
means
so
much
to
me
thereupon
without
waiting
for
my
answer
she
turned
and
ran
out
through
the
little
doorway
which
opened
as
a
matter
of
fact
into
the
larder
of
the
inn
from
which
there
was
an
exit
into
a
i
could
hear
martin
the
landlord
talking
to
the
eurasian
doctor
in
the
passage
outside
the
and
before
i
had
time
to
open
the
door
there
came
a
peremptory
rap
the
door
was
opened
from
the
outside
and
damar
greefe
entered
in
spite
of
the
already
great
heat
of
the
morning
he
wore
a
heavy
black
overcoat
and
his
white
hair
showed
in
startling
relief
beneath
a
black
felt
hat
if
i
had
been
surprised
at
the
tallness
of
the
woman
who
had
so
suddenly
departed
the
stature
of
the
eurasian
was
curiously
illustrated
by
the
fact
that
he
had
to
lower
his
head
in
order
to
enter
the
little
doorway
ah
he
exclaimed
peering
towards
me
where
i
stood
in
the
badly
lighted
room
addison
i
believe
at
your
service
greefe
i
replied
i
understood
that
my
niece
was
here
your
niece
i
exclaimed
and
my
astonishment
was
quite
unfeigned
precisely
that
peremptory
manner
which
i
had
previously
resented
in
him
evinced
itself
now
and
even
had
i
lacked
reasons
other
than
personal
for
foiling
him
i
should
certainly
have
returned
a
reply
far
from
pacific
i
was
not
aware
he
continued
his
voice
and
harsh
that
you
were
acquainted
inform
me
all
the
time
he
was
peering
about
the
room
suspiciously
and
i
inform
you
that
we
are
not
i
said
but
if
we
were
i
can
not
conceive
that
our
acquaintance
would
concern
you
in
any
way
you
are
rude
sir
he
cried
and
bent
towards
me
so
that
i
could
see
the
fierce
hawk
face
set
in
a
vicious
scowl
i
should
be
sorry
to
think
so
i
said
indifferently
for
the
eurasian
behavior
transcended
the
merely
annoying
and
was
that
of
a
lunatic
i
would
not
willingly
provoke
a
sick
man
and
the
tone
and
manner
of
your
address
forcibly
suggest
to
me
that
your
temperature
is
not
normal
a
moment
he
stood
bending
towards
me
his
pose
that
of
one
about
to
spring
then
ah
he
exclaimed
yes
you
are
right
addison
i
live
much
alone
and
i
fear
my
manner
grows
brusk
overlook
it
she
has
gone
then
if
you
refer
to
a
lady
who
called
upon
me
half
an
hour
ago
yes
she
is
gone
he
drew
himself
upright
again
and
stood
there
gigantic
in
the
little
room
a
great
gaunt
figure
ah
and
she
was
not
my
niece
i
lack
the
pleasure
of
your
niece
acquaintance
dr
greefe
yes
you
said
so
good
day
mr
addison
he
turned
lowered
his
head
and
walked
out
of
the
room
when
i
in
turn
emerged
into
the
passage
i
saw
him
striding
out
of
the
inn
martin
was
standing
by
the
door
of
the
looking
very
confused
and
as
i
joined
him
intent
upon
a
chat
i
observed
that
the
stranger
had
departed
hullo
martin
i
exclaimed
i
thought
i
saw
a
customer
here
when
you
came
in
there
was
he
went
off
with
cassim
and
hawkins
they
was
goin
to
show
him
the
road
to
manton
cassim
aye
martin
growled
and
walked
behind
the
you
have
some
curious
residents
in
this
neighborhood
too
curious
by
half
cassim
for
instance
is
not
an
english
name
martin
indulged
in
that
rumbling
sound
which
was
his
only
form
of
laughter
english
he
said
he
as
black
as
your
hat
my
hat
chanced
to
be
gray
but
i
followed
the
idea
nevertheless
and
what
i
exclaimed
a
negro
a
blackamoor
that
all
i
know
or
care
and
dumb
dumb
and
a
friend
of
hawkins
god
knows
things
ai
right
do
you
know
if
a
lady
resides
with
dr
greefe
maybe
maybe
not
there
tales
told
substantially
this
was
all
i
learned
from
mine
host
but
having
lighted
my
pipe
i
sat
down
on
the
bench
before
the
door
and
set
my
mind
to
work
in
an
endeavor
to
marshal
all
the
facts
into
some
sort
of
order
the
reputation
locally
enjoyed
by
damar
greefe
i
could
afford
to
ignore
i
thought
but
from
my
personal
observation
of
the
man
i
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
much
about
him
which
i
did
not
and
could
not
understand
in
the
first
place
for
any
man
to
choose
to
live
solitary
in
such
an
abode
as
the
bell
house
was
remarkable
why
had
the
masterful
eurasian
retired
to
that
retreat
in
company
with
his
black
servitor
i
thought
of
my
own
case
but
it
did
not
seem
to
afford
a
strict
analogy
then
who
was
the
niece
so
closely
guarded
by
greefe
and
if
she
was
none
other
than
my
late
elegant
visitor
why
had
she
sought
the
interview
not
even
my
natural
modesty
which
in
such
matters
i
have
sometimes
thought
to
be
excessive
could
conceal
from
me
the
fact
that
she
had
found
my
society
pleasing
but
since
i
had
never
seen
her
before
did
this
theory
account
for
her
visit
recalling
again
that
huskily
caressing
voice
i
asked
myself
the
question
i
seen
her
before
perhaps
the
apparition
of
green
eyes
looking
up
to
my
window
from
the
lane
below
which
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
i
had
relegated
to
the
limbo
of
dreamland
had
been
verity
and
not
phantasm
if
that
were
so
then
the
uncanny
visitant
to
my
cottage
had
pursued
me
to
upper
crossleys
or
could
it
be
the
fact
that
she
had
preceded
me
perhaps
gatton
had
not
confided
the
whole
of
his
ideas
to
me
perhaps
as
i
had
already
suspected
the
heart
of
the
mystery
lay
here
and
not
in
london
the
result
of
my
meditations
was
that
i
determined
in
pursuit
of
my
original
plan
first
to
call
upon
edward
hines
and
having
inquired
of
martin
the
way
to
leeways
farm
i
took
my
stick
and
set
out
chapter
xvi
the
golden
cat
it
was
a
perfect
morning
and
although
the
sun
had
not
yet
attained
to
its
full
power
it
had
dispersed
the
early
mist
and
i
knew
that
in
another
hour
or
less
the
heat
would
once
more
have
become
tropical
during
the
first
part
of
my
walk
and
whilst
i
remained
in
the
neighborhood
of
upper
crossleys
i
met
never
a
wayfarer
and
memories
of
the
green
eyes
followed
me
step
by
step
so
that
i
was
often
tempted
to
look
back
over
my
shoulder
by
the
idea
that
i
should
detect
as
i
had
detected
once
before
the
presence
of
some
follower
i
resented
this
impulse
however
i
felt
that
my
imagination
was
adding
horrors
to
those
which
already
actually
existed
so
that
i
should
presently
find
myself
unable
to
distinguish
the
real
from
the
imaginary
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
steady
tramping
i
saw
before
me
a
place
where
a
wood
dipped
down
to
the
wayside
so
that
its
trees
cast
a
broad
shadow
across
the
path
i
knew
that
the
entrance
to
the
farm
lay
just
beyond
and
pressing
on
past
the
trees
i
saw
many
outbuildings
having
none
of
that
deserted
appearance
which
characterized
the
neighboring
homesteads
of
upper
crossleys
twenty
yards
beyond
the
farm
itself
appeared
in
view
there
was
some
sign
of
activity
about
the
yard
and
walking
briskly
forward
i
presently
found
myself
looking
into
a
place
containing
numbers
of
here
a
woman
was
engaged
in
sweeping
the
floor
and
i
have
called
to
see
edward
hines
i
said
can
you
tell
me
where
i
shall
find
him
the
woman
stared
at
me
in
a
strange
and
almost
stupefied
manner
is
he
a
friend
of
yours
she
inquired
he
is
not
exactly
a
friend
of
mine
i
continued
but
i
have
very
particular
business
with
him
she
continued
to
stare
in
that
curious
way
and
remained
silent
for
so
long
that
i
began
to
think
she
was
not
going
to
reply
when
if
edward
is
not
expecting
you
she
said
i
do
know
that
i
should
advise
you
to
go
in
he
is
not
very
well
just
now
and
he
is
sometimes
rather
strange
i
know
i
said
i
quite
understand
but
he
will
be
willing
to
see
me
when
he
knows
what
i
have
come
about
shall
i
find
him
yonder
i
pointed
towards
an
open
door
leading
to
which
was
a
neat
graveled
path
lined
by
and
which
i
took
to
be
the
main
entrance
to
the
farm
well
sir
said
the
woman
doubtfully
they
tell
you
there
if
edward
is
to
be
seen
but
i
do
advise
it
that
all
right
i
cried
and
proceeded
in
the
direction
of
the
doorway
i
presently
obtained
a
view
of
a
cozily
furnished
room
where
a
old
lady
was
bustling
about
engaged
in
some
domestic
duties
i
paused
at
the
threshold
my
name
is
addison
i
said
would
it
be
possible
for
me
to
have
a
few
minutes
conversation
with
edward
hines
the
old
lady
whom
i
suspected
to
be
the
mother
of
the
youth
whom
i
was
seeking
paused
in
the
midst
of
her
task
and
looked
at
me
in
a
troubled
way
it
was
evident
enough
that
the
reputation
of
edward
was
the
same
in
his
home
as
elsewhere
and
it
occurred
to
me
that
his
upbringing
must
have
been
a
very
bad
one
well
she
replied
after
this
eloquent
pause
he
up
in
his
room
certainly
but
he
does
like
to
see
visitors
i
know
he
will
be
perfectly
willing
to
see
i
said
confidently
i
have
news
of
importance
for
him
and
as
she
continued
to
look
at
me
in
that
troubled
way
i
know
of
his
present
disfigurement
i
explained
you
need
not
be
afraid
of
any
unpleasant
scenes
if
i
were
sure
of
that
she
said
hesitatingly
and
looked
me
over
with
a
critical
eye
does
he
know
you
sir
oh
yes
i
answered
we
have
met
before
i
assure
you
it
will
be
quite
all
right
if
you
will
just
let
me
walk
up
and
announce
myself
to
him
mrs
hines
if
i
had
had
any
doubt
upon
the
point
i
was
soon
to
learn
that
she
was
indeed
the
mother
of
the
notorious
edwards
for
ere
she
had
time
to
reply
a
querulous
voice
which
i
had
heard
before
cried
out
from
somewhere
above
if
that
any
one
for
me
mother
tell
him
to
go
away
you
know
perfectly
well
i
wo
see
any
one
there
you
are
sir
said
hines
unable
to
hide
her
embarrassment
i
told
you
he
would
see
you
please
give
me
permission
to
go
up
i
said
he
will
change
his
mind
when
he
hears
what
i
have
to
say
you
hear
mother
came
the
irritable
voice
i
break
his
neck
if
he
comes
up
here
judging
from
the
sound
of
the
voice
i
concluded
that
the
excited
young
man
was
located
in
a
room
immediately
above
that
at
the
door
of
which
i
stood
do
be
alarmed
madam
i
said
and
stepping
into
the
room
i
placed
my
hand
reassuringly
upon
the
old
lady
shoulder
without
waiting
for
any
further
protest
i
advanced
to
an
open
staircase
which
i
had
already
marked
as
leading
to
the
apartment
above
and
confidently
mounted
the
pressman
is
not
readily
excluded
and
a
few
moments
later
i
found
myself
in
an
extremely
untidy
bedroom
the
walls
of
which
were
decorated
with
sporting
prints
kirchner
drawings
and
photographs
of
many
damsels
the
scarred
young
man
his
face
still
a
mass
of
stood
with
clenched
fists
facing
me
and
get
out
was
his
greeting
before
i
throw
you
out
my
dear
sir
i
said
unless
you
particularly
want
to
figure
in
a
very
undignified
light
as
a
witness
in
a
trial
for
murder
sit
down
and
listen
to
me
edward
hines
hesitated
opening
and
closing
his
hands
and
glaring
at
me
in
a
preposterous
fury
what
the
game
he
demanded
what
are
you
talking
about
i
am
talking
of
mystery
i
replied
the
mystery
his
expression
changed
and
he
dropped
down
into
an
armchair
from
which
he
had
evidently
arisen
upon
hearing
my
voice
below
i
observed
a
copy
of
a
daily
paper
lying
upon
the
carpet
and
the
conspicuous
headline
was
sufficient
to
show
me
that
he
had
actually
been
reading
the
latest
reports
concerning
the
case
at
the
time
of
my
arrival
i
had
judged
my
man
pretty
accurately
by
this
time
and
drawing
up
another
chair
which
stood
near
me
i
sat
down
facing
him
holding
out
my
open
i
quite
understand
your
sensitiveness
in
the
circumstances
i
said
soothingly
but
there
is
no
occasion
to
suppose
that
i
have
come
to
remind
you
of
your
misfortune
have
a
cigar
i
want
a
chat
with
you
he
continued
to
watch
me
in
a
lowering
way
but
i
was
gradually
getting
him
in
hand
with
very
poor
grace
he
accepted
a
cigar
lighted
it
and
threw
the
match
away
without
offering
to
light
mine
i
did
not
appear
to
notice
his
churlishness
but
immediately
approached
the
matter
about
which
i
had
come
although
i
am
not
a
member
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
i
continued
i
am
nevertheless
in
a
sense
an
agent
of
scotland
yard
and
i
must
ask
you
to
listen
very
seriously
to
what
i
have
to
say
you
have
in
your
possession
a
certain
gold
amulet
he
was
on
his
feet
in
a
moment
the
patches
of
skin
visible
between
the
strapping
assuming
a
purple
color
a
more
choleric
young
man
i
had
never
met
damn
you
he
cried
what
has
it
to
do
with
you
sit
down
i
said
sternly
i
have
given
you
one
warning
i
shall
not
give
you
another
you
will
either
answer
my
questions
civilly
here
and
now
or
answer
them
in
court
whichever
you
please
i
shall
not
give
you
another
opportunity
of
choosing
i
will
repeat
my
remark
you
have
in
your
possession
a
certain
gold
amulet
in
the
form
i
believe
of
a
cat
he
was
choking
and
muttering
and
glaring
at
me
as
i
spoke
but
i
stared
at
him
coolly
and
finally
he
resumed
his
seat
and
reached
out
one
hand
towards
a
which
stood
beside
his
chair
pulling
one
of
the
drawers
open
he
took
out
a
little
gold
figure
of
bâst
and
holding
it
towards
me
is
this
the
thing
you
mean
he
jerked
uncivilly
it
is
i
replied
allow
me
to
examine
it
he
seemed
rather
reluctant
to
do
so
but
nevertheless
i
took
it
from
his
hand
and
looked
at
it
closely
beyond
doubt
it
was
of
ancient
egyptian
workmanship
and
probably
a
genuine
bubastite
votive
offering
raising
my
eyes
to
him
again
without
in
any
way
desiring
to
pry
into
your
affairs
i
said
would
you
be
good
enough
to
tell
me
how
this
came
into
your
possession
the
studied
coolness
of
my
manner
was
having
its
proper
effect
and
edward
hines
although
sulkily
replied
at
once
a
woman
gave
it
to
me
what
was
her
name
i
do
know
you
do
know
the
name
of
a
woman
who
gave
you
a
costly
trinket
of
this
kind
a
ridiculous
look
of
vanity
appeared
in
his
eyes
is
it
very
valuable
he
inquired
it
may
be
worth
as
much
as
i
answered
quietly
really
said
he
with
something
approaching
geniality
in
his
tones
well
it
an
extraordinary
thing
but
i
assure
you
i
do
know
her
name
of
course
i
said
with
machiavellian
cunning
i
do
expect
you
to
remember
the
name
of
every
girl
who
has
loved
you
but
this
is
an
unusual
present
to
receive
even
from
an
infatuated
woman
it
an
extraordinary
thing
is
it
repeated
edward
hines
full
of
i
ca
make
out
the
women
at
all
they
always
giving
me
presents
look
at
that
i
got
that
from
a
girl
i
had
only
seen
three
times
and
it
solid
silver
he
added
i
glanced
at
the
memento
indicated
and
observed
that
it
contained
a
photograph
of
hines
without
the
an
excellent
likeness
of
yourself
too
i
remarked
it
not
bad
said
he
disparagingly
it
was
done
by
one
of
the
big
people
up
in
london
the
girl
paid
for
it
but
even
that
i
pursued
even
that
is
not
so
remarkable
a
gift
as
this
valuable
piece
of
jewelry
which
i
hold
in
my
hand
no
said
the
youth
now
restored
to
the
utmost
by
my
undisguised
admiration
of
his
don
qualities
but
the
fact
remains
that
i
do
know
her
name
to
this
day
what
did
you
mean
he
continued
when
you
said
that
i
was
concerned
in
some
way
in
mystery
i
meant
i
explained
that
the
police
are
looking
for
a
woman
who
answers
to
the
description
of
your
friend
really
he
cried
a
tall
woman
very
fine
figure
beautifully
dressed
i
think
it
is
probably
the
same
i
said
had
she
any
peculiarities
of
appearance
or
manner
by
which
you
would
recognize
her
again
she
had
several
peculiarities
by
which
i
should
recognize
her
he
declared
a
note
of
resentment
now
proclaiming
itself
in
his
voice
and
they
were
hines
leaned
forward
tapping
me
on
the
knee
confidentially
i
met
her
by
accident
you
understand
he
confided
on
the
london
road
one
evening
about
sunset
set
she
asked
me
the
way
to
park
and
i
could
see
that
i
had
made
an
impression
at
once
it
was
just
an
excuse
to
speak
to
me
of
course
i
offered
to
walk
that
far
with
her
she
agreed
and
to
cut
a
long
story
short
the
usual
thing
of
course
she
wanted
to
meet
me
again
well
he
resumed
complacently
i
met
her
on
the
following
thursday
and
we
became
very
good
friends
you
understand
except
that
she
always
seemed
particularly
anxious
to
return
home
before
dusk
all
this
time
i
never
knew
who
she
was
or
even
where
she
lived
but
of
course
i
could
see
how
the
land
lay
she
was
some
lady
from
london
staying
at
one
of
the
big
houses
about
here
and
had
to
show
up
for
dinner
that
night
when
we
parted
she
gave
me
this
little
gold
thing
and
arranged
to
see
me
again
he
paused
knocking
ash
from
his
cigar
and
seemingly
reflecting
as
to
how
he
should
word
his
next
communication
but
finally
the
third
time
i
saw
her
he
said
i
managed
to
arrange
that
she
could
not
get
in
quite
so
early
you
understand
and
then
i
know
exactly
how
to
tell
you
i
am
not
a
chap
that
gets
in
a
panic
very
easily
but
i
may
mention
that
the
scene
took
place
in
a
wood
she
gave
me
the
biggest
scare
i
have
ever
had
in
my
life
he
bent
forward
and
again
tapped
me
on
the
knee
my
dear
addison
i
think
you
said
your
name
was
her
eyes
lighted
up
in
the
dark
like
a
cat
he
stared
at
me
with
some
return
of
his
old
truculence
as
if
anticipating
ridicule
and
prepared
to
resent
it
but
i
nodded
sternly
watching
him
as
if
enthralled
by
his
narrative
whereupon
yes
like
a
cat
he
repeated
and
i
admit
i
got
in
a
panic
i
do
know
if
she
thought
from
the
way
i
yelled
that
i
was
going
to
attack
her
or
what
but
the
next
thing
i
knew
she
was
at
my
throat
he
uttered
a
sort
of
choking
sound
tenderly
touched
the
bandages
about
his
neck
and
fingered
the
plaster
which
ornamented
his
face
at
your
throat
said
i
you
mean
she
tried
to
throttle
you
throttle
me
he
exclaimed
scornfully
she
seized
me
with
her
but
i
said
and
hesitated
for
i
feared
i
might
wound
his
curious
susceptibility
the
damage
to
your
face
damn
her
he
cried
damn
her
i
had
never
seen
her
without
her
gloves
you
understand
but
she
must
have
taken
them
off
that
night
for
he
indicated
his
plastered
countenance
is
what
she
did
with
her
nails
he
paused
staring
at
me
dully
and
then
with
a
hint
of
the
old
ridiculous
vanity
entering
his
voice
but
i
scored
after
all
he
said
tossing
the
little
amulet
into
the
drawer
from
which
he
had
taken
it
if
that
worth
it
will
more
than
pay
the
doctor
bill
i
think
following
a
brief
interval
of
course
i
said
you
would
recognize
the
woman
again
i
am
not
so
certain
declared
the
scarred
man
she
always
wore
some
sort
of
veil
but
you
may
be
sure
he
added
in
a
tone
of
supreme
condescension
that
she
was
a
very
pretty
woman
or
i
should
have
been
bothering
with
her
you
are
quite
sure
of
that
i
ventured
to
remark
no
doubt
about
it
at
all
most
extraordinary
eyes
too
damned
extraordinary
by
half
well
i
said
i
am
much
indebted
to
you
for
your
statement
and
you
may
be
confident
that
it
will
materially
assist
the
investigation
now
in
progress
do
mention
it
said
hines
airily
if
i
can
ever
do
anything
else
for
you
just
let
me
know
but
i
mean
to
say
i
rely
upon
you
not
to
bring
me
into
it
you
understand
what
i
mean
you
may
be
absolutely
certain
i
replied
that
no
hint
of
this
occurrence
will
ever
be
made
public
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
i
took
my
departure
from
leeways
farm
fully
satisfied
with
the
result
of
the
first
move
in
the
plan
of
campaign
upon
which
i
had
decided
returning
to
my
quarters
at
the
abbey
inn
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
the
afternoon
in
writing
a
detailed
account
of
my
interview
with
edward
hines
having
completed
this
i
set
out
for
the
town
as
by
posting
my
report
there
and
not
in
the
wayside
box
at
upper
crossleys
i
knew
that
i
could
count
upon
its
delivery
at
new
scotland
yard
by
the
first
mail
in
the
morning
in
leisurely
fashion
i
performed
the
journey
for
my
next
move
could
not
be
made
until
after
dusk
chapter
xvii
the
nubian
mute
i
returned
from
the
little
market
town
beneath
a
sky
of
tropical
brilliance
the
landscape
was
bathed
in
a
radiance
of
perfect
moonlight
and
under
the
trees
which
thickly
lined
the
way
the
shadows
had
a
velvet
quality
rarely
met
with
in
england
their
edges
showing
more
sharply
defined
than
i
ever
remembered
to
have
noticed
them
before
but
ere
long
i
grew
oblivious
even
of
the
beauty
of
the
night
becoming
absorbed
in
reflections
respecting
this
most
extraordinary
case
every
new
datum
acquired
instead
of
serving
to
elucidate
seemed
only
more
completely
to
obscure
the
issue
mystery
revealed
itself
within
mystery
and
this
was
indeed
a
labyrinth
to
the
heart
of
which
i
sometimes
despaired
of
penetrating
who
was
this
woman
whose
elusive
figure
appeared
at
every
turn
in
the
case
was
she
one
and
the
same
with
the
visitor
to
my
cottage
who
had
purloined
the
green
enameled
statuette
and
could
it
be
that
i
had
actually
sat
in
conversation
with
her
in
the
of
the
abbey
inn
and
had
failed
to
recognize
her
for
what
she
was
beyond
doubt
she
had
extraordinary
cleverness
and
was
a
weaver
of
spells
so
that
in
a
sense
she
could
temporarily
disguise
her
personality
whilst
at
one
moment
she
was
a
repellent
creature
at
another
she
was
a
fascinating
woman
of
the
world
versed
in
strange
lores
and
a
most
entertaining
companion
what
object
underlay
her
diverse
activities
assuming
that
she
was
concerned
in
the
murder
of
sir
marcus
coverly
the
purpose
of
her
visit
to
my
cottage
was
not
far
to
seek
she
had
come
to
recover
incriminating
evidence
and
had
been
aided
it
seemed
by
the
hand
of
fate
but
why
had
she
come
to
visit
me
at
the
abbey
inn
and
what
had
she
gained
by
this
interview
perhaps
i
reflected
as
i
plodded
along
the
deserted
country
road
she
had
been
interrupted
on
that
occasion
by
the
inopportune
appearance
of
damar
greefe
again
why
had
he
appeared
there
at
that
moment
if
not
because
he
had
suspected
her
presence
at
the
inn
and
what
was
the
relationship
existing
between
these
two
singular
people
that
the
strange
story
related
to
me
by
the
idiotic
edward
hines
simply
resolved
itself
into
an
idle
adventure
on
the
part
of
the
mysterious
woman
which
she
had
been
forced
to
terminate
somewhat
ferociously
i
admit
by
the
uncouth
ardor
of
this
rustic
swain
i
seemed
to
perceive
but
unless
her
visit
to
the
abbey
inn
portended
that
she
had
selected
me
as
edward
hines
successor
i
failed
to
fit
it
into
the
scheme
i
began
to
long
for
the
presence
of
inspector
gatton
for
the
assistance
of
his
trained
mind
in
plumbing
these
depths
which
defied
my
single
efforts
who
this
woman
could
be
i
failed
to
imagine
and
assuming
that
she
had
been
concerned
in
the
death
of
the
late
baronet
in
what
way
she
stood
to
profit
by
it
was
utterly
beyond
my
comprehension
as
was
the
position
of
damar
greefe
in
the
matter
on
i
walked
and
on
unconsciously
increasing
my
pace
as
is
my
way
when
i
am
lost
in
abstraction
and
perhaps
stimulated
to
greater
mental
clarity
by
the
exercise
some
of
my
doubts
were
dispersed
and
i
became
convinced
at
last
that
the
shadowy
figure
which
had
dogged
my
footsteps
on
the
night
of
the
crime
the
owner
of
those
blazing
eyes
which
had
watched
me
from
my
garden
the
woman
who
had
stolen
the
amulet
from
my
and
the
woman
who
had
mutilated
edward
hines
were
one
and
the
same
as
my
visitor
at
the
abbey
inn
and
the
unseen
speaker
who
had
conversed
beneath
my
window
on
the
night
of
my
arrival
at
upper
crossleys
here
then
was
a
definite
chain
linking
the
red
house
with
park
or
at
least
with
its
vicinity
and
now
so
clearly
did
my
ideas
fit
themselves
each
into
its
correct
place
that
i
determined
upon
the
identity
of
that
other
speaker
who
had
stood
in
the
shadows
opposite
the
inn
when
i
had
awakened
in
the
night
mentally
i
recaptured
the
high
rather
coarse
tones
of
his
voice
and
remembering
how
touched
by
the
spell
which
had
seemed
to
lie
upon
the
whole
i
had
thought
of
him
as
asmodeus
the
master
of
the
witches
revels
i
determined
that
my
judgment
had
been
not
inexact
for
now
i
identified
the
speaker
as
damar
greefe
so
far
my
meditations
had
proceeded
and
i
suppose
i
was
about
on
my
journey
towards
the
abbey
inn
when
all
at
once
i
became
aware
again
of
that
uncomfortable
feeling
of
surveillance
as
on
that
night
when
returning
from
the
red
house
to
my
cottage
i
had
experienced
a
conviction
that
i
was
followed
so
now
a
like
conviction
impressed
itself
upon
my
mind
but
whereas
on
the
former
occasion
i
had
been
less
fearful
than
curious
now
i
was
aware
of
a
positive
dread
of
this
follower
whose
presence
i
had
detected
by
what
sense
i
know
not
and
of
a
certainty
of
a
very
grave
menace
accordingly
i
determined
upon
a
certain
plan
which
i
proceeded
to
put
into
execution
without
delay
i
was
traversing
a
stretch
of
road
at
the
moment
that
i
first
fell
a
victim
to
this
unpleasant
suspicion
which
indeed
was
more
than
a
suspicion
when
ahead
of
me
i
observed
a
patch
some
twenty
yards
in
extent
which
was
entirely
overshadowed
by
trees
for
at
this
point
the
woods
clothing
a
slope
which
ran
right
down
to
the
road
closely
impinged
upon
the
highway
and
i
had
noticed
something
at
this
spot
on
my
outward
journey
which
i
now
proposed
to
employ
to
my
advantage
into
this
patch
of
darkness
i
walked
then
my
steps
sounding
crisply
along
the
road
on
i
went
for
some
twenty
yards
until
i
found
the
particular
spot
for
which
i
was
seeking
this
was
a
sort
of
little
bay
or
inlet
where
until
quite
recently
a
heap
of
stones
used
by
roadmenders
had
lain
and
into
this
i
marched
never
once
altering
my
pace
but
having
gained
it
i
performed
an
and
continued
to
mark
time
there
whilst
surveying
the
road
behind
me
the
object
of
this
trick
will
be
evident
enough
for
whilst
the
sound
of
my
footsteps
would
lead
one
in
pursuit
to
suppose
that
i
was
proceeding
upon
my
way
through
the
shadows
actually
i
was
staring
intently
back
in
quest
of
the
pursuer
of
whose
presence
i
had
become
assured
perhaps
in
spite
of
the
cautious
manner
in
which
he
had
advanced
he
had
made
some
slight
sound
which
subconsciously
detected
had
nevertheless
intruded
upon
my
reverie
and
in
this
way
had
acquainted
me
with
his
presence
for
now
continuing
that
steady
beat
but
watching
intently
i
saw
him
taking
every
advantage
of
the
shade
cast
by
the
hedge
on
the
right
of
the
road
a
figure
was
coming
towards
me
that
the
tracker
was
desirous
of
avoiding
observation
the
manner
of
his
approach
sufficiently
proved
and
if
i
had
had
any
doubts
respecting
his
purpose
they
would
have
been
resolved
in
a
manner
painful
to
myself
had
i
not
had
the
good
fortune
to
detect
him
in
time
a
piece
of
road
there
was
which
because
of
a
gap
in
the
hedge
afforded
no
shadow
and
as
the
gliding
shape
reached
this
point
and
passed
it
i
obtained
a
momentary
but
clear
view
of
my
pursuer
i
was
being
tracked
by
a
nubian
mute
that
one
glance
was
sufficient
to
convince
me
of
the
horrible
truth
the
man
was
stripped
to
the
waist
in
order
no
doubt
that
his
movements
might
not
be
impeded
and
i
beheld
a
torso
like
that
of
some
milo
wrought
in
ebony
the
cruel
animal
face
the
blubber
lips
the
partly
bared
teeth
all
spoke
of
the
fate
designed
for
me
i
knew
the
type
and
knew
what
scant
mercy
i
could
look
for
at
his
hands
indubitably
this
was
a
mute
such
as
is
sometimes
attached
to
the
harêms
of
great
eastern
houses
to
this
day
and
even
if
i
had
known
nothing
of
the
functions
of
such
a
servitor
the
fact
that
he
carried
something
in
his
left
hand
would
have
enlightened
me
it
was
a
i
smiled
grimly
respecting
the
identity
of
my
assassin
there
was
little
room
for
doubt
he
was
the
black
servant
of
damar
greefe
now
as
he
passed
the
bright
patch
of
roadway
and
began
to
glide
silently
nearer
through
the
shadows
i
marked
time
with
a
lighter
step
the
more
deeply
to
confuse
him
of
the
strange
nubian
dialect
i
knew
nothing
but
taking
it
for
granted
that
the
man
was
familiar
with
arabic
i
raised
my
voice
in
a
mournful
cry
and
in
the
arab
tongue
cassim
cassim
i
wailed
satan
is
calling
for
you
i
think
i
have
never
witnessed
such
an
exhibition
of
panic
fright
as
i
now
beheld
cassim
was
less
than
ten
yards
away
and
i
could
hear
his
teeth
chattering
cassim
i
cried
again
fly
fly
satan
is
here
a
horrible
tongueless
babbling
answered
the
cry
there
came
a
scuffling
and
i
saw
the
nubian
gleaming
body
leap
out
into
the
lighted
roadway
as
he
fled
faster
faster
cassim
i
wailed
he
is
behind
you
ah
he
is
cassim
staggered
turned
and
then
stood
still
looking
this
way
and
that
in
a
perfect
delirium
of
fear
finally
he
whirled
around
to
the
right
shrieking
wildly
i
think
some
nocturnal
insect
had
brushed
against
him
plunged
babbling
up
the
bank
to
the
hedge
and
heedless
of
the
fact
that
it
contained
many
thorns
which
must
have
cruelly
lacerated
his
bare
body
scrambled
half
through
it
and
half
over
it
into
the
plowed
field
beyond
against
such
an
enemy
there
is
no
more
potent
weapon
than
superstition
nevertheless
i
kept
my
hand
upon
the
pistol
in
my
pocket
and
proceeded
at
an
increased
pace
during
the
latter
half
of
my
journey
nor
am
i
ashamed
to
admit
that
the
lights
of
the
abbey
inn
were
a
welcome
sight
and
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
relief
that
leaving
the
highroad
behind
me
i
found
myself
again
in
the
village
street
of
upper
crossleys
what
to
expect
next
i
knew
not
the
other
party
had
made
a
false
move
for
i
now
had
definite
evidence
of
the
antagonism
of
damar
greefe
and
of
his
intent
to
cause
my
murder
through
the
agency
of
his
nubian
servant
my
plan
of
nocturnal
operations
already
sufficiently
dangerous
now
promised
to
lead
me
into
extreme
peril
i
would
have
given
much
for
the
company
of
gatton
but
if
i
must
act
alone
alone
i
would
set
out
if
i
am
slow
in
planning
at
least
i
can
state
with
truth
that
i
am
tenacious
in
execution
but
here
now
was
open
warfare
and
i
must
look
for

into

behind

he
seemed
to
be
immersed
in
the

before
him

although
useless
and
indeed
injurious
for

wear
are
ideal

and
further
looked
to
the
condition
and
readiness
of
my
pistol
finally
slipping
an
electric
torch
into
my
pocket
i
set
out
the
bar
was
closing
when
i
came
downstairs
martin
stared
at
me
dully
i
going
for
a
moonlight
ramble
i
explained
will
any
one
be
up
to
let
me
in
or
should
you
prefer
to
give

was
the
laconic
reply
come
in
when
you

to
a
such

piece
of
information
must
have
sounded
alarming
but
knowing
something
of
the
ways
of
these
country
communities
it
did
not
greatly
surprise
me
and
bidding
the
landlord
good
night

by

had
advanced
the
inquiry
further
than
any
unaided
endeavors
of
mine
could
well
have
done
clearly
enough
the
eurasian
regarded
my
presence
as
inimical
to
his
safety
in
admitting
so
much
he
had
admitted
guilt
of
some
kind
in
fact
i
felt
assured
that
he
was
determined
at
all
costs
to
prevent
my
visiting
friar
park
having
failed
in
his
unmistakable
endeavor
to
remove
me
entirely
for
so
i
construed
the
nubian
instructions
he
would
undoubtedly
recognize
that
the
game
was
up
he
was
clearly
a
desperate
man
and
i
recognized
that
the
only
hope
i
had
of
foiling
him
lay
in
acting
with
despatch
this
was
a
perfect
night
with
never
a
cloud
to
mar
the
blue
serenity
of
the
sky
but
in
spite
of
its
beauty
i
was
more
than
ever
conscious
of
that
sense
of
loneliness
and
desolateness
which
seemed
to
be
the
most
marked
characteristic
of
the
country
hereabouts
i
met
never
a
soul
upon
the
highway
nor
indeed
did
i
encounter
any
evidence
of
life
whatever
until
turning
into
a
narrow
lane
which
would
bring
me
to
that
road
in
the
valley
upon
which
stood
the
deserted
lodge
belonging
to
the
bell
house
an
owl
hooted
in
the
trees
above
my
head
keenly
alert
to
the
possibility
that
my
movements
might
be
watched
i
paused
wondering
if
the
sound
which
had
proceeded
from
a
low
bough
directly
above
me
had
really
been
made
by
an
owl
or
by
a
human
mimic
for
the
hoot
of
an
owl
being
easy
to
imitate
is
much
favored
for
signaling
purposes
taking
my
electric
torch
from
my
pocket
i
directed
its
ray
upward
into
the
close
foliage
of
the
oak
tree
whereupon
with
a
ghostly
fluttering
of
dark
wings
an
owl
flew
away
i
proceeded
confidently
down
the
sloping
road
amid
a
silence
so
intense
that
my
steps
seemed
to
create
a
positive
clamor
coming
to
the
corner
i
looked
along
to
the
left
where
the
lane
alternate
patches
of
silver
and
ebony
showed
deserted
as
far
as
i
could
see
this
was
the
direction
of
the
gate
of
the
bell
house
and
the
road
which
sloped
gently
downwards
on
that
side
rose
in
a
rather
sharper
activity
on
my
right
it
was
at
this
point
that
i
had
mistaken
the
way
on
my
first
journey
to
friar
park
therefore
i
proceeded
to
the
right
seeking
the
entrance
which
i
was
convinced
i
should
find
somewhere
within
the
next
two
hundred
yards
the
lane
inclined
gently
leftward
and
presently
as
i
had
anticipated
i
came
upon
a
lodge
overgrown
with
ivy
and
but
partly
visible
beyond
the
gates
which
barred
the
end
of
the
drive
that
this
was
the
entrance
to
friar
park
i
felt
assured
but
i
had
no
intention
of
seeking
admittance
in
the
usual
way
pursuing
a
high
wall
evidently
of
great
age
which
divided
the
grounds
from
the
road
i
walked
on
for
fully
three
hundred
yards
here
the
wall
which
enclosed
what
had
once
been
the
kitchen
garden
of
the
monastery
gave
place
to
a
lofty
hedge
in
which
i
presently
discovered
a
gap
wide
enough
to
allow
of
my
making
my
way
through
entering
i
found
myself
in
a
sort
of
parkland
boasting
many
majestic
and
venerable
trees
elms
for
the
most
part
where
the
parkland
ended
and
the
woods
began
it
was
impossible
to
make
out
but
away
to
my
left
i
could
follow
the
high
wall
to
where
clearly
visible
in
the
moonlight
which
at
this
point
was
unobstructed
by
trees
a
gate
appeared
towards
this
i
made
my
way
keeping
a
sharp
lookout
for
those
of
which
i
had
heard
and
equally
on
the
alert
for
any
hidden
human
presence
without
meeting
with
any
obstacle
however
i
reached
the
gate
only
to
find
that
it
was
closed
and
fastened
with
a
stout
padlock
there
was
a
dry
ditch
bordering
the
wall
and
i
followed
this
back
towards
the
highroad
hoping
that
somewhere
i
might
chance
upon
a
means
of
scaling
the
wall
i
made
slow
progress
for
presently
i
came
upon
a
quantity
of
undergrowth
which
i
distrusted
keenly
as
it
would
afford
admirable
cover
for
traps
in
this
way
i
had
come
nearly
back
to
the
hedge
lining
the
road
before
i
discovered
what
i
was
looking
for
here
a
grew
sufficiently
close
to
the
ditch
to
serve
my
purpose
its
lower
branches
were
within
easy
reach
whilst
further
up
i
espied
one
which
stretched
out
across
the
top
of
the
wall
looping
over
my
wrist
the
thong
attached
to
my
stick
i
scrambled
up
into
the
tree
and
soon
found
myself
astride
the
wall
beneath
me
was
a
neglected
orchard
and
beyond
to
the
right
a
wilderness
which
once
had
been
an
extensive
directly
before
me
lay
the
lodge
but
the
house
was
invisible
from
where
i
sat
being
evidently
situated
somewhere
beyond
a
dense
coppice
into
which
i
perceived
the
drive
to
lead
for
patched
here
and
there
by
the
moonlight
i
could
trace
it
running
through
the
trees
a
vine
grew
upon
the
wall
beneath
me
its
aged
tendrils
of
the
thickness
of
ropes
and
it
afforded
a
natural
ladder
whereby
i
made
my
descent
arrived
in
the
miniature
jungle
which
at
some
period
had
been
a
i
set
out
towards
the
lodge
prompted
to
do
so
by
the
presence
of
a
light
shining
out
from
one
of
the
windows
through
a
network
of
leaves
i
knew
not
if
i
should
look
for
within
the
place
enclosed
by
the
wall
but
nevertheless
i
neglected
no
precaution
picking
my
way
through
the
forest
of
weeds
which
had
supplanted
the
vegetables
and
sweet
herbs
to
which
doubtless
this
land
had
once
been
sacred
observing
even
greater
precaution
as
i
neared
the
building
i
presently
found
myself
looking
in
at
the
lighted
window
and
only
concealed
from
the
occupants
of
the
room
by
the
presence
of
a
tangled
bush
which
formed
a
sort
of
natural
curtain
the
room
into
which
i
was
peering
presented
a
scene
of
great
disorder
it
was
a
poorly
furnished
apartment
characteristic
of
the
rustic
workman
dwelling
and
was
evidently
the
living
room
of
the
it
was
in
process
of
being
dismantled
cupboards
and
chests
stood
open
and
my
acquaintance
hawkins
was
engaged
in
packing
various
belongings
into
a
large
wooden
box
set
in
the
center
of
the
floor
upon
the
bare
wooden
table
stood
the
oil
lamp
whose
light
i
had
seen
shining
out
of
the
window
and
bending
over
a
number
of
papers
apparently
engaged
in
making
up
some
sort
of
an
account
was
a
woman
whom
i
took
to
be
the
wife
of
the
she
had
oily
black
hair
and
a
very
lowering
and
unpleasant
cast
of
countenance
whilst
the
large
earrings
which
she
wore
added
to
her
gipsy
appearance
an
argument
of
some
kind
was
in
progress
between
the
two
for
ever
and
anon
the
woman
would
raise
her
eyes
from
her
task
and
dart
venomous
glances
at
the
man
who
knelt
upon
the
floor
packing
the
big
box
fragments
of
the
conversation
reached
me
through
the
partly
open
window
and
although
it
was
difficult
to
follow
i
gathered
that
the
woman
was
reproaching
her
husband
with
some
alleged
indiscretion
which
had
necessitated
the
departure
for
which
they
were
preparing
hawkins
retorted
with
a
savage
energy
which
displayed
the
darker
side
of
the
man
character
and
the
one
which
i
had
suspected
to
lie
beneath
his
rather
sinister
merriment
having
satisfied
myself
that
the
pair
were
deeply
occupied
with
their
personal
affairs
i
crept
out
upon
the
drive
and
began
to
approach
the
house
i
had
formed
a
rough
idea
of
the
distance
at
which
it
lay
from
the
road
and
this
was
proved
to
have
been
about
correct
the
drive
swung
round
in
a
wide
and
presently
majestic
in
the
moonlight
with
some
of
its
mediæval
charm
restored
by
the
magic
of
night
i
saw
friar
park
before
me
it
was
a
low
rambling
building
bespeaking
the
monastery
in
some
of
its
severe
outlines
and
showing
a
succession
of
cloisteresque
arches
on
the
left
terminated
by
a
chapel
beyond
which
rose
the
ancient
tower
visible
from
the
a
wonderful
example
of
saxon
architecture
and
closely
resembling
that
at
earl
barton
there
was
no
light
in
any
of
the
windows
and
indeed
as
i
peered
more
closely
across
the
wide
space
intervening
between
the
end
of
the
drive
and
the
main
entrance
of
the
house
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
place
was
more
of
a
ruin
than
a
habitable
establishment
unaware
of
what
eyes
might
be
watching
me
from
any
one
of
the
numerous
windows
i
stepped
into
the
shrubbery
beneath
the
trees
bordering
the
drive
and
set
out
to
make
a
detour
of
the
house
without
if
possible
revealing
my
presence
to
any
one
who
might
be
watching
from
within
in
the
prosecution
of
this
plan
i
met
with
not
a
little
difficulty
several
times
in
fact
i
had
to
show
myself
in
the
moonlight
upon
the
edge
of
the
unkempt
lawns
but
by
this
device
and
that
i
finally
achieved
my
purpose
and
returned
to
the
spot
from
whence
i
had
set
out
without
having
attracted
any
visible
notice
here
i
paused
to
consider
what
i
had
learned
the
most
notable
thing
was
this
only
one
wing
of
friar
park
that
remote
from
the
tower
exhibited
any
evidence
of
occupation
indeed
of
being
habitable
at
all
in
other
words
the
greater
part
of
the
building
was
no
more
than
a
majestic
ruin
eyeless
windows
there
were
and
crumbling
arches
whilst
the
chapel
which
had
looked
so
picturesque
from
a
distance
proved
on
closer
inspection
to
be
a
mere
shell
a
dense
shrubbery
grew
right
up
to
the
walls
of
the
east
wing
that
which
was
terminated
by
the
tower
and
i
had
been
enabled
to
peer
right
in
at
the
window
of
the
chapel
and
out
at
a
window
at
the
other
side
for
the
place
was
roofless
and
its
floor
carpeted
with
weeds
i
could
not
help
wondering
how
much
of
this
decay
dated
from
the
days
of
sir
burnham
for
certainly
i
could
not
reconcile
it
with
the
character
of
the
man
as
depicted
by
the
local
people
my
inquiry
then
was
considerably
narrowed
down
for
of
the
habitable
apartments
of
friar
park
i
had
only
been
enabled
to
count
seven
or
eight
although
two
of
these
appeared
to
be
of
great
extent
one
of
them
i
fancy
being
the
old
refectory
of
the
monastery
my
next
discovery
was
this
that
the
likeliest
point
of
entry
to
the
house
was
afforded
by
either
one
of
two
french
windows
which
opened
upon
a
small
lawn
some
twenty
yards
beyond
the
drive
but
in
order
to
approach
them
i
should
have
to
expose
myself
in
the
brilliant
moonlight
which
bathed
that
side
of
the
house
i
stood
there
listening
intently
and
wondering
if
i
dared
attempt
the
venture
not
a
sound
could
i
detect
however
and
the
night
was
so
still
that
scarce
a
leaf
stirred
about
me
i
determined
upon
the
plunge
and
walking
boldly
forward
i
approached
the
more
easterly
of
the
two
windows
three
stone
steps
led
up
to
it
and
linen
blinds
were
drawn
down
within
but
strengthened
by
the
memory
of
the
inn
door
which
was
never
locked
and
hoping
that
the
same
trustfulness
prevailed
in
friar
park
i
turned
the
handle
whose
brassy
glitter
i
had
previously
perceived
from
the
corner
of
the
shrubbery
it
operated
smoothly
and
upon
giving
a
gentle
push
the
window
opened
and
i
found
myself
standing
upon
a
polished
oak
floor
i
stood
listening
but
there
was
never
a
sound
and
partly
reclosing
the
window
i
pressed
the
button
of
my
electric
torch
and
looked
about
me
i
stood
in
a
long
lofty
room
which
i
supposed
to
have
been
a
it
was
empty
containing
not
a
single
item
of
furniture
from
my
pocket
i
took
two
pairs
of
thick
woolen
socks
and
drew
them
one
over
the
other
on
to
my
boots
to
deaden
my
footfalls
the
door
of
this
empty
and
desolate
room
was
open
and
stepping
softly
i
walked
out
into
a
wide
corridor
my
mind
filled
with
terrifying
recollections
of
the
red
house
three
other
rooms
i
explored
and
although
in
two
of
them
some
items
of
massive
furniture
remained
covered
with
no
sign
of
habitation
did
i
come
upon
the
whole
of
the
ground
floor
proved
to
be
vacant
and
a
broad
uncarpeted
stair
suggested
that
the
floors
above
were
also
deserted
by
their
occupants
i
mounted
softly
but
the
stairs
creaked
in
a
horrible
fashion
so
that
i
became
hotly
apprehensive
before
i
gained
the
top
i
had
nothing
to
fear
however
for
again
empty
rooms
alone
rewarded
my
search
my
most
significant
discovery
in
the
upper
part
of
the
house
was
that
of
a
bedroom
which
was
still
almost
completely
furnished
and
in
which
even
the
yet
remained
untidily
strewn
about
the
bed
but
there
were
thick
spiders
webs
stretching
from
the
coverlet
to
the
canopy
and
a
coating
of
dust
lay
everywhere
when
i
finally
returned
to
the
empty
i
had
convinced
myself
of
that
which
i
had
come
to
seek
friar
park
was
uninhabited
chapter
xix
the
man
on
the
tower
i
quitted
friar
park
unobserved
as
i
had
entered
it
walking
quickly
across
to
the
shrubbery
i
began
to
work
my
way
back
to
the
point
at
which
i
must
strike
westward
in
order
to
reach
the
at
the
risk
of
encountering
i
gave
the
lodge
a
wide
berth
and
came
out
in
sight
of
the
wall
at
a
point
much
nearer
the
lawns
of
the
house
than
that
from
which
i
had
entered
what
it
was
that
prompted
me
to
turn
and
take
a
final
look
at
the
house
i
can
not
say
but
before
commencing
to
make
my
way
through
the
wilderness
of
the
i
know
that
i
stood
and
looked
back
towards
the
ancient
saxon
tower
which
uprose
silvered
by
the
moonlight
above
the
trees
that
obscured
from
my
view
all
the
rest
of
the
house
right
to
the
embrasured
crest
it
was
sharply
outlined
by
the
brilliant
moon
and
as
i
looked
i
felt
my
heart
leap
suddenly
and
then
almost
holding
my
breath
i
crouched
distrusting
the
very
shadows
which
afforded
me
shelter
for
leaning
out
through
one
of
the
embrasures
at
the
top
of
the
tower
i
clearly
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
at
first
so
whitely
was
his
face
lighted
up
by
the
moon
that
i
had
no
doubt
of
the
figure
being
that
of
a
man
but
he
remained
so
still
seeming
always
to
look
in
a
fixed
way
in
the
same
direction
that
now
momentarily
i
doubted
until
a
slight
movement
betrayed
the
fact
that
my
first
impression
had
been
correct
who
he
was
i
could
not
possibly
tell
from
that
distance
but
of
his
occupation
i
became
assured
at
the
moment
that
he
moved
for
the
moonlight
glittered
brightly
on
the
lenses
of
the
binoculars
through
which
he
had
been
surveying
some
point
visible
only
from
that
elevation
still
i
watched
and
again
i
saw
the
man
of
the
tower
raise
his
glasses
and
resume
his
scrutiny
of
that
distant
object
which
so
closely
engaged
his
attention
remembering
that
a
patch
of
light
touched
the
top
of
the
wall
spearlike
at
the
point
where
i
must
cross
it
in
order
to
reach
the
fir
tree
i
abandoned
my
former
precautions
and
hurried
through
the
tangled
weeds
towards
the
fir
which
was
my
sailing
mark
hastily
i
scrambled
up
the
natural
ladder
formed
by
the
vine
and
without
pause
climbed
down
again
to
the
edge
of
the
dry
ditch
beyond
to
have
looked
back
over
the
wall
would
have
been
useless
since
from
that
point
the
tower
would
have
been
invisible
nor
indeed
had
i
any
desire
to
pause
in
my
precarious
journey
that
i
had
avoided
in
that
hurried
retreat
through
the
weeds
i
knew
not
whether
to
ascribe
to
good
luck
or
to
the
fact
that
none
were
set
there
but
now
in
the
more
open
ground
thickly
bestrewn
however
with
clumps
of
undergrowth
i
resumed
all
my
old
vigilance
and
carefully
retraced
the
path
so
well
as
i
could
remember
it
by
which
i
had
first
arrived
at
the
friendly
fir
when
at
last
i
found
myself
once
more
upon
the
highroad
and
free
of
the
ground
of
friar
park
i
stood
a
while
and
wondered
to
find
myself
bathed
in
perspiration
there
was
something
very
eerie
in
the
thought
that
i
had
explored
those
numerous
rooms
of
the
deserted
house
and
had
moreover
encircled
the
entire
building
habitable
and
otherwise
whilst
that
mysterious
watcher
all
the
time
had
been
lurking
up
there
in
the
tower
i
wondered
what
his
survey
portended
if
it
signified
that
he
had
detected
my
presence
at
the
moment
that
i
had
left
the
house
why
was
his
gaze
focused
upon
the
distance
and
not
upon
the
surrounding
grounds
if
he
had
not
seen
or
heard
me
then
i
must
compliment
myself
upon
a
very
successful
burglarious
feat
but
assuming
the
latter
explanation
to
be
the
correct
one
how
much
darker
became
the
mystery
of
the
man
presence
and
purpose
who
was
he
and
what
did
he
do
at
this
hour
in
deserted
friar
park
since
i
had
left
the
deeply
engaged
in
his
packing
operations
at
the
lodge
i
dismissed
the
idea
that
the
figure
on
the
tower
might
have
been
that
of
hawkins
nor
was
i
in
any
way
assisted
in
my
attempts
to
solve
the
mystery
by
what
i
had
seen
of
the
man
for
the
distance
had
been
too
great
to
allow
of
my
perceiving
his
face
with
anything
like
clearness
presently
then
i
set
out
upon
my
return
journey
to
the
abbey
inn
turning
over
in
my
mind
this
added
perplexity
which
had
entered
the
case
as
gatton
had
quite
recently
observed
every
new
piece
of
evidence
which
came
to
light
in
this
most
bewildering
affair
seemed
merely
to
plunge
the
issue
in
greater
obscurity
than
ever
my
feet
once
set
upon
the
slope
which
led
to
upper
crossleys
i
allowed
this
mood
of
abstraction
to
have
its
way
and
the
problem
with
which
i
found
myself
principally
engaged
was
that
of
the
disappearance
of
lady
burnham
coverly
as
i
remembered
the
suave
assurances
of
damar
greefe
that
the
of
lady
burnham
rendered
it
impossible
for
her
to
receive
visitors
i
wondered
anew
at
the
complex
villainy
of
this
formidable
eurasian
the
state
of
the
rooms
in
friar
park
clearly
demonstrated
the
fact
that
neither
lady
coverly
nor
any
other
had
resided
there
for
many
months
perhaps
many
years
what
then
did
it
all
mean
what
was
the
purpose
of
the
watch
and
ward
kept
by
the
gipsy
over
the
grounds
and
approaches
to
the
house
it
could
only
mean
that
this
was
a
device
of
damar
greefe
to
prevent
any
of
the
neighbors
from
seeking
admittance
to
the
house
and
thus
learning
the
strange
secret
which
its
emptiness
revealed
here
in
fact
in
this
old
monastic
establishment
would
seem
to
reside
the
very
genius
of
that
spirit
of
desolation
which
had
touched
me
unpleasantly
in
the
hour
of
my
arrival
in
crossleys
i
determined
to
ascertain
by
inquiries
amongst
the
local
tradespeople
none
of
whom
i
had
hitherto
met
by
what
means
the
fact
that
no
one
resided
at
friar
park
was
concealed
from
those
whose
ordinary
business
activities
would
demand
their
presenting
themselves
at
the
house
for
orders
etc
but
even
as
the
plan
suggested
itself
to
me
i
thought
i
perceived
an
answer
to
my
question
in
all
probability
i
determined
damar
greefe
or
the
hawkins
who
were
palpably
his
creatures
acted
as
a
barrier
between
the
tradespeople
and
the
missing
lady
of
the
park
but
what
it
could
all
portend
was
a
problem
beyond
the
power
of
my
imagination
or
deductive
reasoning
if
lady
coverly
had
changed
her
residence
for
some
reason
with
what
object
did
the
eurasian
continue
to
lead
every
one
in
the
neighborhood
to
suppose
that
she
still
resided
at
friar
park
it
was
all
a
hopeless
tangle
and
the
more
i
thought
about
it
the
more
discouraged
did
i
become
i
seemed
to
get
further
too
from
that
link
for
which
i
sought
the
link
connecting
the
mystery
with
that
other
which
i
always
associated
with
the
red
house
the
luminous
eyes
afforded
the
visible
link
this
i
could
not
doubt
but
what
relation
to
the
death
of
sir
marcus
did
the
disappearance
of
lady
burnham
coverly
bear
secondly
what
was
damar
greefe
place
in
the
scheme
and
thirdly
the
most
appalling
mystery
of
all
who
or
what
was
the
woman
with
the
cat
eyes
at
this
point
in
my
meditations
i
discovered
that
i
had
arrived
before
the
abbey
inn
now
plunged
in
darkness
and
believing
that
i
detected
the
sound
of
footsteps
behind
me
i
became
eventually
the
victim
of
a
sort
of
panic
which
perhaps
will
be
forgiven
me
under
the
circumstances
for
emerging
from
these
unpleasant
reflections
and
hearing
or
believing
that
i
heard
sounds
of
pursuit
from
the
lonely
road
behind
i
know
that
i
hurried
forward
to
the
side
door
and
silently
prayed
that
i
should
find
it
unfastened
as
martin
had
assured
me
that
it
would
be
in
this
particular
i
was
speedily
reassured
for
the
door
opened
to
my
touch
and
i
became
conscious
of
a
wish
that
there
might
be
some
means
of
fastening
it
from
within
however
i
could
find
none
but
hurrying
upstairs
i
determined
to
take
a
precaution
which
hitherto
i
had
not
adopted
and
that
night
to
lock
my
bedroom
door
entering
the
room
i
fumbled
for
a
box
of
matches
in
my
pocket
and
presently
discovering
them
struck
one
and
looked
about
me
for
the
candle
which
usually
stood
upon
a
little
cabinet
beside
the
bed
however
it
had
been
moved
for
some
reason
and
put
over
by
the
window
on
the
as
i
made
this
discovery
the
match
smoldered
out
and
at
the
moment
i
was
about
to
strike
another
the
sound
of
footsteps
which
i
had
formerly
detected
grew
louder
and
nearer
so
that
i
could
no
longer
doubt
that
some
one
was
running
along
the
road
towards
the
abbey
inn
a
great
curiosity
respecting
this
person
seized
me
and
without
striking
a
match
as
i
had
intended
to
do
i
walked
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
road
twenty
yards
away
i
saw
the
figure
of
a
man
who
seemed
to
be
come
almost
to
the
end
of
his
resources
for
i
could
hear
him
panting
as
he
ran
nor
did
my
wonder
decrease
when
as
he
came
nearer
and
stared
up
in
my
direction
i
recognized
him
for
the
person
whom
i
had
observed
that
morning
sitting
on
the
bench
before
the
inn
door
wondering
what
his
presence
might
portend
for
clearly
his
business
was
with
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
and
as
he
came
up
to
the
door
of
the
inn
i
saw
him
stagger
and
clutch
at
the
post
which
supported
the
swaying
dizzily
he
was
clearly
almost
exhausted
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
was
a
husky
whisper
do
light
your
candle
he
said
now
this
remark
coming
at
such
a
time
and
in
these
circumstances
struck
me
as
so
ludicrous
that
at
first
i
was
tempted
to
laugh
but
the
man
earnest
sincerity
as
evidenced
by
his
exhausted
condition
and
the
urgency
of
his
manner
did
not
fail
to
impress
me
and
why
not
i
asked
still
leaning
out
of
the
window
and
filled
with
a
great
wonderment
never
mind
he
panted
do
can
i
come
up
something
now
in
the
breathless
speech
of
the
man
below
struck
me
as
oddly
familiar
but
yet
so
dense
was
i
that
i
failed
to
recognize
the
truth
of
the
matter
and
certainly
i
said
i
will
bring
a
light
down
to
show
you
the
way
if
you
have
business
with
me
no
light
he
cried
hoarsely
if
you
value
your
life
do
strike
a
match
by
this
time
so
bewildered
had
i
become
that
i
scarce
knew
whether
to
descend
to
meet
this
apparent
madman
or
to
remain
where
i
was
do
hesitate

he
cried
now
beginning
to
recover
his
breath
do
exactly
as
i
tell
you
good
god
i
exclaimed
i
turned
and
ran
to
the
door
and
on
downstairs
for
at
last
i
had
recognized
the
voice
of
this
midnight
runner
throwing
open
the
door
i
held
out
my
hand
and
the
man
extended
his
in
return
i
cried
excitedly
gatton
what
on
earth
does
this
mean
why
have
you
been
masquerading
in
this
fashion
i
saw
you
here
this
morning
and
you
never
gave
me
the
slightest
sign
of
acknowledgment
i
never
intended
to
panted
the
inspector
staggering
rather
than
walking
up
the
stairs
but
i
have
performed
one
of
the
hardest
tasks
of
my
life
and
have
only
succeeded
by
a
few
seconds
we
were
now
at
the
door
of
my
room
but
do
go
in
said
gatton
shortly
let
me
think
what
we
must
do
but
i
do
understand
at
all
you
will
understand
in
a
moment
was
the
grim
reply
you
would
have
understood
already
if
you
had
lighted
your
candle
words
failed
me
altogether
at
that
we
stood
in
the
passage
for
some
moments
in
silence
then
we
have
got
to
risk
it
said
gatton
if
my
theory
is
to
be
put
to
the
test
risk
it
oh
i
can
assure
you
of
the
risk
he
declared
it
will
be
are
you
game
well
i
said
laughing
in
a
very
forced
fashion
this
has
been
a
night
of
such
intense
surprises
that
i
think
i
can
survive
one
more
very
well
replied
the
inspector
and
there
was
something
strange
in
hearing
the
familiar
voice
and
dimly
discerning
in
the
reflected
moonlight
which
shone
in
at
a
window
further
along
the
passage
the
unfamiliar
figure
before
me
what
have
we
to
do
we
have
to
take
a
chance
of
sudden
death
he
answered
but
we
will
minimize
it
as
much
as
possible
seeing
me
about
to
give
voice
to
one
of
the
many
questions
which
literally
burned
upon
my
tongue
explanations
can
come
later
said
he
where
can
i
find
a
candle
there
is
one
on
the
just
to
the
left
of
the
window
i
will
get
it
but
he
grasped
my
arm
roughly
and
this
is
business
wait
here
for
me
he
rapped
tersely
he
heard
the
rasp
of
the
match
upon
the
box
as
i
struck
a
light
to
guide
him
in
his
search
whereupon
i
thought
i
warned
you
he
cried
and
struck
the
match
from
my
hand
with
that
he
pushed
open
the
door
and
i
saw
his
square
figure
outlined
against
the
open
window
as
he
crossed
the
room
since
he
had
referred
to
the
peril
which
hung
over
us
it
was
with
bated
breath
that
i
awaited
his
return
not
in
the
least
knowing
what
to
expect
a
few
moments
later
he
returned
with
the
candlestick
now
said
he
carefully
reclosing
the
door
light
the
candle
awed
by
something
in
his
voice
and
manner
i
did
as
he
directed
without
demur
noting
with
amazement
in
the
light
thus
created
how
simple
yet
how
effective
was
the
disguise
which
my
friend
had
adopted
he
gave
me
no
time
for
comment
however
but
listen
said
he
i
going
to
put
this
candle
in
your
room
and
then
you
and
i
are
going
to
run
run
i
cried
exactly
run
for
our
lives
preferably
upstairs
is
there
any
vacant
room
above
from
which
we
can
look
out
in
the
same
direction
as
from
your
window
the
room
above
is
vacant
i
replied
and
probably
we
shall
find
the
door
unlocked
we
risk
that
then
said
gatton
you
might
start
and
lead
the
way
can
i
use
my
electric
torch
i
asked
on
the
stairs
replied
gatton
but
you
must
extinguish
it
when
we
enter
the
room
above
with
that
he
thrust
open
the
door
of
my
bedroom
ran
in
and
ran
out
again
banging
the
door
behind
him
as
though
pursued
by
devils
then
the
pair
of
us
were
racing
up
the
stairs
madly
for
the
room
above
i
vaguely
wondering
if
my
companion
had
taken
leave
of
his
senses
yet
of
the
verity
of
the
peril
which
he
dreaded
came
speedy
confirmation
at
the
very
moment
that
my
hand
touched
the
knob
of
the
door
above
and
ere
i
could
open
it
the
whole
fabric
of
the
abbey
inn
was
convulsed
the
floor
rocked
beneath
my
feet
and
there
ensued
the
sound
of
a
deafening
explosion
from
the
room
below
an
echo
or
what
sounded
like
an
echo
sharp
and
staccato
came
from
the
distant
hills
chapter
xx
gatton
story
it
no
good
going
in
now
said
gatton
in
a
weary
voice
in
fact
it
might
be
dangerous
we
have
to
consider
the
possibility
of
fire
however
he
added
voices
of
sleepers
awakened
and
cries
of
inquiry
sounded
now
from
all
over
the
inn
for
naturally
the
household
had
been
aroused
by
the
tremendous
noise
of
the
explosion
for
my
own
part
i
was
altogether
too
dazed
to
conjecture
what
had
happened
but
that
gatton
had
saved
me
from
some
deadly
peril
i
was
well
convinced
stirrings
and
the
noise
of
footsteps
came
from
an
adjoining
room
and
presently
in
his
night
attire
martin
appeared
very
bemused
addison
he
began
and
stared
from
me
to
my
companion
let
no
one
leave
their
rooms
said
gatton
decisively
until
i
give
them
permission
eh
began
martin
heavily
i
am
a
police
officer
added
gatton
and
you
will
all
do
as
i
direct
does
any
one
sleep
on
the
same
floor
as
mr
addison
no
sir
replied
martin
who
was
not
yet
more
than
half
awake
but
who
nevertheless
had
been
impressed
by
the
inspector
authoritative
manner
sounds
of
footsteps
from
the
floor
above
now
became
audible
whereupon
order
every
one
to
remain
in
their
rooms
repeated
gatton
martin
raising
his
voice
obeyed
him
what
are
your
arrangements
in
the
case
of
fire
continued
the
inspector
several
betousled
heads
were
peeping
down
from
the
landing
above
but
no
one
spoke
until
martin
collected
his
ideas
sufficiently
to
reply
there
buckets
in
the
stables
and
there
the
well
wilkins
sleeps
over
the
stables
can
you
make
him
hear
without
going
downstairs
i
can
try
was
the
answer
martin
walked
to
a
window
which
lighted
the
landing
and
threw
it
widely
open
leaning
out
wilkins
he
roared
wilkins
aye
aye
boss
came
faintly
from
somewhere
below
tell
him
to
stand
by
with
but
not
to
leave
the
yard
without
orders
from
me
directed
gatton
martin
issued
these
instructions
in
a
voice
which
must
have
been
audible
at
leeways
and
then
stood
scratching
his
head
stupidly
but
indeed
of
all
the
bewildered
company
who
gathered
that
night
beneath
the
roof
of
the
abbey
inn
i
think
i
was
the
most
nonplused
of
all
and
turning
to
gatton
for
god
sake
tell
me
what
it
all
means
i
said
it
means
he
answered
and
even
through
his
disguise
i
recognized
the
old
grim
smile
that
only
a
match
stood
between
you
and
eternity
even
now
we
can
not
afford
to
sit
down
but
i
am
not
anxious
to
pass
your
door
for
a
few
minutes
as
we
both
have
much
to
say
let
us
find
a
room
where
we
can
talk
accordingly
we
went
up
to
a
large
empty
room
at
the
back
of
the
inn
through
the
open
doorway
i
could
hear
the
excited
voices
of
the
entire
staff
of
the
establishment
who
had
congregated
in
martin
room
across
the
landing
never
in
the
history
of
the
abbey
inn
had
such
doings
taken
place
perhaps
continued
gatton
it
will
save
time
if
you
tell
me
exactly
what
you
have
done
first
very
well
i
said
but
before
i
begin
when
did
you
arrive
an
hour
and
a
half
after
receiving
your
code
telegram
i
came
by
car
the
car
is
at
manton
now
why
this
disguise
i
will
explain
in
a
moment
but
meanwhile
your
own
story
at
that
although
consumed
with
impatience
i
quickly
outlined
my
movements
from
the
time
of
my
arrival
at
upper
crossleys
the
inspector
following
me
closely
the
tale
concluded
now
gatton
i
cried
for
heaven
sake
tell
me
what
it
all
means
i
will
tell
you
all
i
know
he
replied
slowly
in
the
first
place
i
had
two
reasons
for
suggesting
the
visit
to
friar
park
i
had
formed
an
opinion
that
the
was
interested
in
whether
because
she
regarded
you
as
dangerous
or
from
some
other
cause
i
could
not
determine
and
i
thought
of
a
plan
for
finding
out
if
she
was
by
any
chance
associated
with
friar
park
it
was
to
send
you
down
here
a
to
make
straightforward
inquiries
and
b
to
the
cat
very
good
of
you
i
murmured
i
warned
you
it
was
dangerous
said
gatton
grimly
but
i
am
pleased
to
say
the
plan
worked
to
perfection
your
own
inquiries
have
been
highly
satisfactory
and
you
have
also
the
cat
now
just
to
show
you
how
dramatic
your
discoveries
really
were
i
will
explain
my
second
and
more
important
reason
and
the
one
which
primarily
had
prompted
me
to
turn
my
attention
to
friar
park
a
few
hours
before
you
came
to
the
yard
the
other
morning
to
see
the
bag
dropped
in
the
water
by
eric
coverly
i
had
been
in
touch
with
the
solicitors
who
had
acted
for
the
late
sir
burnham
ah
i
exclaimed
what
had
they
to
say
i
was
seeking
information
of
course
respecting
the
entail
in
short
trying
to
fathom
the
mystery
of
what
eric
coverly
would
have
had
to
gain
by
getting
his
cousin
out
of
the
way
i
learned
that
financially
he
gained
nothing
but
a
bundle
of
debts
friar
park
was
mortgaged
to
the
hilt
furthermore
lady
burnham
coverly
had
a
life
interest
in
the
property
under
the
will
of
her
husband
next
from
the
senior
partner
a
solicitor
of
the
old
school
who
still
retained
pleasant
memories
of
sir
burnham
port
i
learned
a
number
of
very
significant
details
he
paused
staring
at
me
oddly
and
the
familiar
expression
beneath
the
unfamiliar
disguise
was
very
curious
then
about
seven
or
eight
years
ago
he
resumed
shortly
after
his
return
from
according
to
hardacre
the
solicitor
something
occurred
which
made
a
changed
man
of
his
client
sir
burnham
you
will
note
addison
shortly
after
his
return
from
he
realized
upon
quantities
of
securities
and
raised
a
big
sum
of
ready
money
which
he
disposed
of
in
some
way
which
has
always
remained
a
mystery
to
hardacre
in
short
within
a
period
of
three
years
or
less
from
being
a
wealthy
man
he
became
a
poor
one
next
he
sent
roger
coverly
his
only
child
then
a
mere
lad
abroad
in
care
of
a
tutor
hardacre
never
knew
for
what
reason
as
there
was
apparently
nothing
wrong
with
the
boy
health
he
began
to
dismiss
his
servants
the
greater
part
of
friar
park
was
shut
up
and
allowed
to
fall
into
decay
finally
to
hardacre
surprise
and
grief
sir
burnham
mortgaged
the
property
but
it
was
the
terms
of
the
mortgage
which
i
was
privileged
to
inspect
which
aroused
my
curiosity
in
brief
the
mortgagee
agreed
in
the
event
of
sir
burnham
death
to
allow
the
widow
to
retain
possession
of
the
property
for
life
whether
payments
fell
in
arrears
or
otherwise
but
this
i
exclaimed
is
as
a
friend
of
yours
once
remarked
as
mad
as
in
wonderland
i
agree
but
to
continue
at
the
time
that
this
extraordinary
agreement
was
drawn
up
hardacre
went
down
to
friar
park
of
course
and
he
was
a
witness
of
several
most
singular
and
significant
occurrences
for
instance
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
whilst
he
was
dressing
for
dinner
sir
burnham
came
running
to
his
room
and
begged
of
him
to
lock
his
door
and
to
remain
in
his
room
until
his
host
gave
him
permission
to
come
out
he
was
particularly
warned
against
admitting
any
one
might
in
the
interval
good
heavens
i
cried
and
did
any
one
knock
no
one
but
about
half
an
hour
later
sir
burnham
came
and
released
him
hardacre
was
unspeakably
distressed
to
observe
that
sir
burnham
looked
white
and
ill
in
fact
in
hardacre
own
words
five
years
older
again
quite
by
accident
on
the
same
night
he
came
upon
his
host
kneeling
in
the
chapel
in
those
days
it
still
boasted
a
roof
deep
in
prayer
an
atmosphere
of
indescribable
horror
he
declared
had
settled
upon
friar
park
and
although
as
he
confessed
he
had
no
evidence
to
prove
the
correctness
of
his
theory
he
nevertheless
traced
this
to
the
person
of
the
mortgagee
for
it
seemed
to
correspond
roughly
with
the
appearance
in
the
neighborhood
of
this
man
whom
he
now
met
for
the
first
time
again
gatton
paused
taking
out
his
pipe
and
pouch
and
who
was
this
person
i
asked
a
certain
damar
greefe
good
god
i
cried
where
is
all
this
leading
us
gatton
it
is
leading
us
slowly
to
the
truth
addison
and
that
truth
when
we
come
to
it
is
going
to
be
more
horrible
than
we
even
suspect
passing
over
much
of
hardacre
evidence
i
come
to
the
death
in
switzerland
of
roger
coverly
under
circumstances
so
obscure
that
i
fear
we
shall
never
know
the
particulars
of
one
thing
however
i
am
assured
there
was
foul
play
you
mean
that
roger
coverly
was
murdered
i
really
do
doubt
it
replied
gatton
who
having
filled
his
pipe
now
lighted
it
i
believe
he
was
the
first
victim
the
victim
addison
i
agree
with
the
late
sir
burnham
solicitor
that
the
spider
at
the
heart
of
this
web
is
damar
greefe
the
shock
of
his
son
premature
death
led
to
a
collapse
from
which
sir
burnham
never
recovered
and
friar
park
entered
upon
the
final
phase
during
which
it
was
occupied
by
lady
burnham
who
seems
to
have
been
wholly
under
the
influence
of
this
eurasian
doctor
but
my
dear
gatton
i
cried
where
lady
burnham
in
my
opinion
dead
he
answered
solemnly
oh
it
sounds
preposterous
but
in
the
case
of
this
lonely
woman
who
had
apparently
no
living
relatives
and
who
was
estranged
from
sir
marcus
and
the
other
members
of
her
husband
family
it
was
no
very
difficult
matter
to
hush
up
the
fact
of
her
death
but
gatton
you
do
mean
that
she
too
met
with
foul
play
most
certainly
i
do
it
is
as
clear
as
day
that
the
whole
object
of
this
elaborate
secrecy
was
to
the
fact
of
her
death
she
was
infinitely
more
useful
alive
than
dead
addison
and
they
hoped
to
keep
up
the
solemn
farce
until
yes
until
sir
eric
was
hanged
for
the
murder
of
his
cousin
gatton
what
do
you
mean
he
is
the
last
of
the
coverlys
answered
gatton
simply
there
would
be
no
further
danger
of
any
one
paying
off
the
mortgage
danger
exactly
there
is
some
secret
at
friar
park
or
at
the
bell
house
which
necessitates
the
property
remaining
in
the
possession
of
damar
greefe
as
it
has
virtually
remained
since
sir
death
so
much
is
clear
and
although
eric
coverly
has
persisted
in
his
obstinate
silence
one
of
my
assistants
who
has
been
at
work
on
the
late
sir
marcus
papers
made
a
discovery
yesterday
which
together
with
what
i
had
learned
from
hardacre
and
your
code
message
brought
me
down
to
crossleys
post
haste
what
was
this
discovery
an
invitation
from
damar
greefe
dated
only
a
short
time
after
the
death
of
sir
burnham
to
sir
marcus
asking
him
to
visit
park
the
doctor
explained
that
the
state
of
lady
coverly
health
made
it
impossible
for
her
to
entertain
but
he
assured
sir
marcus
that
she
was
anxious
to
see
him
and
to
heal
any
breach
which
might
exist
between
them
most
significant
of
all
the
eurasian
proposed
that
sir
marcus
should
put
up
at
the
abbey
inn
exactly
now
the
room
of
the
inn
is
that
which
you
have
been
occupying
and
it
is
that
which
sir
marcus
would
have
occupied
had
he
accepted
the
doctor
invitation
listen
then
all
these
clews
seemed
to
point
to
friar
park
but
the
receipt
of
your
message
mentioning
one
damar
greefe
as
being
a
suspicious
party
and
asking
me
to
look
up
his
record
quite
tipped
the
scales
i
saw
frankly
that
you
had
made
a
false
move
but
nevertheless
it
served
my
purpose
and
i
determined
to
look
into
the
crossleys
end
of
the
inquiry
personally
without
giving
damar
greefe
reason
to
suspect
that
i
was
in
any
way
associated
with
the
matter
i
picked
up
one
or
two
hints
from
the
county
police
as
to
the
geography
as
well
as
the
of
the
neighborhood
and
the
plan
which
you
put
into
execution
i
had
adopted
last
night
what
you
visited
friar
park
i
did
but
i
did
not
enter
through
the
french
window
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
it
would
be
unfastened
i
had
come
provided
with
a
neat
set
of
burglars
tools
a
warrant
for
use
if
necessary
and
i
broke
into
the
kitchen
found
as
you
afterwards
found
that
the
place
had
obviously
been
deserted
for
a
long
time
i
was
badly
puzzled
but
my
search
was
more
detailed
than
yours
i
climbed
up
to
the
top
of
the
tower
to
the
top
of
the
tower
yes
i
tell
you
what
i
found
there
in
a
minute
but
briefly
beyond
learning
that
the
story
of
the
invalid
lady
coverly
was
a
myth
i
discovered
nothing
likely
to
help
the
inquiry
i
seriously
debated
the
idea
of
putting
damar
greefe
under
arrest
but
finally
i
determined
to
watch
him
for
a
time
without
showing
my
hand
i
had
the
good
fortune
to
meet
him
this
morning
here
at
the
abbey
inn
also
i
saw
your
mysterious
lady
visitor
lastly
i
got
into
conversation
with
the
man
hawkins
who
was
accompanied
by
your
friend
the
mute
leaving
this
dangerous
pair
i
made
a
rush
for
the
bell
house
thinking
i
saw
my
opportunity
to
examine
it
unmolested
i
was
too
late
though
one
of
my
assistants
warned
me
of
the
eurasian
return
just
as
i
was
about
to
enter
i
watched
the
house
all
day
but
it
was
not
until
some
time
after
dusk
that
the
eurasian
came
out
he
went
to
friar
park
and
i
followed
him
what
you
were
there
i
was
i
dogged
damar
greefe
determined
to
learn
the
nature
of
the
business
which
brought
him
to
friar
park
at
such
an
hour
i
may
add
that
it
was
only
by
the
merest
accident
or
good
luck
that
i
fathomed
it
after
all
i
had
no
idea
into
what
part
of
the
building
he
had
gone
but
knowing
that
he
was
somewhere
inside
i
watched
from
the
shrubbery
in
fact
i
was
still
in
the
grounds
when
arrived
then
it
was
you
i
saw
on
the
tower
oh
no
it
was
not
i
had
thoroughly
examined
the
tower
on
my
previous
visit
and
what
i
found
there
had
puzzled
me
badly
in
fact
it
was
not
until
your
admirable
withdrawal
from
friar
park
that
the
horrible
explanation
dawned
upon
me
and
i
realized
that
the
object
of
inviting
sir
marcus
to
upper
crossleys
was
to
him
the
first
plan
failed
of
course
he
never
came
he
went
back
again
on
duty
to
russia
i
believe
for
a
time
but
when
he
returned
a
second
was
adopted
at
the
red
house
however
the
erected
in
accordance
with
the
earlier
plan
was
still
there
where
i
cried
in
bewilderment
on
the
tower
of
friar
park
it
was
the
appearance
of
on
the
platform
of
the
tower
armed
with
binoculars
which
awakened
me
to
the
ghastly
truth
the
device
never
used
in
the
case
of
sir
marcus
was
not
to
be
wasted
but
was
to
be
employed
to
remove
a
dangerous
obstacle
from
the
conspirator
path
i
had
left
the
car
near
crossleys
you
see
and
never
in
my
life
have
i
run
as
i
ran
after
you
but
gatton
did
you
find
on
the
tower
and
what
connection
exists
between
the
tower
and
the
explosion
which
occurred
here
this
a
sort
of
small
howitzer
i
think
of
krupp
manufacture
but
you
would
be
better
able
to
judge
than
i
is
mounted
on
the
platform
of
the
tower
i
examined
it
addison
last
night
and
like
a
fool
concluded
that
it
had
been
used
at
some
time
for
a
local
celebration
and
never
dismounted
it
was
trained
as
i
remembered
nearly
too
late
and
laid
at
a
certain
elevation
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
evidently
never
meant
to
be
moved
yet
at
the
time
the
significance
of
this
did
not
strike
me
how
the
range
was
found
so
exactly
we
shall
probably
never
know
but
the
truth
suddenly
burst
upon
me
as
you
made
off
through
the
bushes
and
as
damar
greefe
came
out
and
began
to
peer
through
his
glasses
that
it
was
mechanically
set
in
such
a
manner
that
it
could
drop
a
projectile
into
the
window
above
the
porch
of
the
abbey
inn
good
god
it
hardly
credible
it
is
i
admit
but
weather
conditions
favored
him
there
was
a
breath
of
wind
and
that
he
succeeded
is
proved
by
the
fact
that
at
the
present
moment
your
room
below
is
probably
still
full
of
poison
gas
of
course
it
not
have
been
a
he
may
have
relied
as
well
he
might
do
on
the
burst
but
i
taking
no
chances
you
can
well
imagine
that
failing
a
knowledge
of
the
arrangement
on
the
tower
no
explanation
of
the
mystery
would
ever
have
been
found
a
would
be
the
popular
theory
and
if
any
fragments
of
shell
were
found
who
would
ever
know
from
where
it
had
been
fired
gatton
i
said
i
owe
you
my
life
but
why
did
this
fiend
try
to
murder
me
gatton
smiled
i
have
a
theory
addison
he
replied
and
it
is
this
i
believe
he
thought
that
the
indiscretion
of
a
certain
mysterious
lady
would
bring
about
his
ruin
if
i
am
not
mistaken
she
has
already
gone
far
to
put
his
neck
in
a
halter
and
he
was
determined
to
nip
this
latest
adventure
in
the
bud
by
removing
the
object
of
her
i
felt
myself
changing
color
and
for
heaven
sake
say
no
more
i
interrupted
it
is
a
gruesome
and
horrible
thought
yet
perhaps
you
are
right
what
must
we
do
gatton
these
people
have
rendered
the
neighborhood
uninhabitable
for
themselves
now
and
dimly
to
my
ears
came
the
sound
of
a
and
have
fled
cried
gatton
springing
up
quick
we
must
chance
the
gas
why
what
was
that
shot
a
signal
damar
greefe
and
cat
have
escaped
he
raced
out
across
the
landing
amid
a
chorus
of
frightened
inquiries
from
the
inn
staff
i
followed
him
into
a
front
room
and
this
comes
of
turning
my
attention
elsewhere
for
half
an
hour
he
cried
angrily
i
seem
to
be
cursed
with
fools
for
assistants
throwing
up
the
window
he
leaned
out
i
stood
at
his
elbow
and
as
i
looked
i
saw
a
great
red
glow
rising
from
the
distant
woods
the
sound
of
a
car
approaching
at
headlong
speed
reached
my
ears
and
at
the
same
moment
i
saw
the
headlights
hullo
there
cried
gatton
blythe
petersham
the
car
stopped
and
a
cry
came
back
we
lost
him
sir
and
the
bell
house
is
in
flames
chapter
xxi
in
london
again
then
the
sudden
change
in
the
police
attitude
towards
eric
said
isobel
is
not
due
to
any
discoveries
which
you
or
inspector
gatton
have
made
at
friar
park
that
i
can
not
say
i
replied
we
have
made
certain
discoveries
as
i
have
already
told
you
but
whilst
they
distinctly
point
to
some
criminal
whose
identity
is
not
yet
fully
established
unfortunately
i
can
not
say
that
in
a
legal
sense
they
clear
coverly
isobel
as
i
had
thought
at
the
first
moment
of
our
meeting
looked
very
tired
and
had
that
pathetic
expression
of
appeal
in
her
eyes
which
had
hurt
me
so
much
when
first
it
had
appeared
there
on
the
morning
after
the
tragedy
she
was
palpably
ill
at
ease
and
i
had
small
cause
to
wonder
at
this
although
a
veiled
paragraph
in
which
i
thought
i
could
detect
the
hand
of
gatton
had
appeared
in
the
press
on
the
previous
day
briefly
stating
that
evidence
had
been
volunteered
by
sir
eric
coverly
which
had
led
to
an
entirely
new
line
of
police
inquiry
the
item
of
news
which
had
naturally
excited
interest
had
never
been
amplified
amid
the
alarms
and
excursions
which
had
terminated
my
visit
to
upper
crossleys
gatton
i
supposed
had
forgotten
to
refer
to
this
matter
but
i
did
not
doubt
that
the
paragraph
was
an
inspired
one
issued
from
scotland
yard
my
friend
object
in
circulating
this
statement
was
not
by
any
means
evident
to
me
but
as
i
expected
to
see
him
later
that
day
i
hoped
to
be
able
to
obtain
from
him
some
explanation
of
his
new
tactics
many
hours
had
elapsed
since
with
the
flames
of
the
burning
bell
house
reddening
the
night
behind
me
and
throwing
into
lurid
relief
the
surrounding
damar
greefe
mysterious
stronghold
i
had
been
borne
along
the
road
towards
london
that
gatton
had
hoped
for
much
from
a
detailed
search
of
the
eurasian
establishment
i
knew
for
i
had
not
forgotten
his
anger
at
the
appearance
of
the
flames
above
the
tree
tops
which
had
told
of
the
foiling
of
his
plans
under
cover
of
the
conflagration
the
cunning
eurasian
had
escaped
every
possible
means
had
been
taken
to
intercept
him
and
whilst
gatton
inspired
by
i
know
not
what
hopes
had
hastened
to
the
burning
bell
house
i
had
set
out
in
the
police
car
in
pursuit
of
damar
greefe
accompanied
by
blythe
upon
whom
apparently
the
onus
of
the
fiasco
rested
in
despite
of
these
measures
the
hunted
man
had
made
good
his
retreat
and
blythe
and
i
had
entered
the
outskirts
of
london
without
once
sighting
the
car
in
which
dannar
greefe
had
fled
no
communication
reached
me
on
the
following
morning
and
i
found
myself
consumed
with
impatient
curiosity
temporarily
out
of
touch
with
gatton
then
shortly
after
came
a
telegram
endeavor
induce
sir
eric
come
to
your
house
eight
will
meet
him
there
gatton
welcoming
any
ground
for
action
since
to
remain
passive
at
such
a
time
was
torture
i
called
at
once
at
coverly
chambers
he
was
out
but
i
left
an
urgent
written
message
for
him
and
in
the
hope
of
finding
him
with
isobel
hurried
to
her
flat
he
had
not
been
there
that
day
however
and
now
i
could
only
hope
that
he
would
return
to
his
rooms
in
time
to
keep
the
appointment
for
that
gatton
had
some
good
reason
for
suggesting
the
meeting
i
did
not
doubt
gatton
and
i
were
now
agreed
that
damar
greefe
if
not
directly
responsible
for
the
death
of
sir
marcus
at
least
had
been
an
accessory
to
his
murder
at
any
rate
he
had
shown
his
hand
firstly
in
the
attempted
assault
upon
myself
by
his
nubian
servant
and
secondly
by
the
devilish
device
whereby
he
had
propelled
some
sort
of
gas
projectile
for
this
we
now
knew
it
to
have
been
from
the
tower
of
friar
park
into
my
room
at
the
abbey
inn
i
had
then
become
obnoxious
to
him
he
evidently
regarded
my
continued
existence
as
a
menace
to
his
own
two
explanations
of
his
attitude
presented
themselves
one
that
my
inquiries
had
led
me
daily
nearer
to
the
heart
of
the
mystery
or
two
that
the
doctor
mysterious
associate
the
possessor
of
the
green
eyes
had
adopted
an
attitude
towards
myself
which
the
eurasian
had
counted
sooner
or
later
as
certain
to
compromise
him
in
short
whilst
it
was
sufficiently
evident
to
me
that
these
mysterious
people
residing
at
upper
crossleys
were
the
criminals
for
whom
new
scotland
yard
was
searching
no
definite
link
between
their
admittedly
dangerous
activities
and
the
crime
we
sought
to
unravel
had
yet
been
brought
to
light
on
the
other
hand
whilst
it
was
not
feasible
to
suppose
that
any
relationship
existed
between
sir
eric
the
new
baronet
and
the
eurasian
or
the
woman
associated
with
the
eurasian
i
was
quite
well
aware
that
equally
there
was
no
evidence
to
show
that
such
an
association
did
not
exist
i
longed
to
be
able
to
offer
some
consolation
to
isobel
who
at
this
time
was
passing
through
days
and
nights
of
dreadful
apprehension
but
beyond
imparting
to
her
some
of
my
own
personal
convictions
i
was
unable
to
say
honestly
that
the
complicity
of
coverly
in
the
murder
was
definitely
and
legally
disproved
if
only
he
would
break
his
absurd
silence
she
said
suddenly
this
ridiculous
suspicion
which
still
seems
to
be
entertained
in
some
quarters
would
be
removed
of
course
but
his
every
act
since
the
night
of
the
tragedy
has
only
intensified
it
she
sat
facing
me
on
the
settee
her
hands
locked
in
her
lap
and
do
you
refer
to
any
new
act
of
his
i
asked
with
which
i
am
not
at
present
acquainted
she
nodded
slowly
yes
she
said
but
i
can
only
tell
you
in
confidence
for
it
is
something
which
inspector
gatton
does
not
know
please
tell
me
i
urged
for
you
are
aware
that
i
have
no
other
object
but
the
clearing
of
coverly
in
the
eyes
of
the
police
and
the
public
well
she
continued
with
hesitation
last
night
he
lodged
with
me
a
copy
of
a
which
he
assured
me
cleared
him
entirely
but
he
imposed
an
extraordinary
condition
what
was
that
i
asked
with
interest
it
was
only
to
be
used
in
the
event
of
the
worst
happening
she
said
what
do
you
mean
in
the
event
of
his
being
put
on
trial
for
murder
isobel
nodded
i
suppose
so
she
said
sadly
it
seems
madness
does
it
absolute
madness
i
agreed
if
he
is
in
a
position
to
establish
an
alibi
why
not
do
it
now
and
be
done
with
the
whole
unsavory
business
that
is
exactly
what
i
pointed
out
to
him
but
he
was
adamant
on
the
matter
and
became
dreadfully
irritable
and
excited
i
did
not
dare
to
press
the
point
so
of
course
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
resignedly
was
it
a
selfish
joy
i
wonder
which
possessed
me
as
i
noted
the
restrained
impatience
with
which
isobel
spoke
of
coverly
i
suppose
it
was
and
perhaps
it
was
even
indefensible
yet
i
record
it
desiring
to
be
perfectly
honest
with
myself
and
with
others
nevertheless
in
the
near
future
i
was
to
regret
the
sentiments
which
at
that
moment
i
entertained
towards
coverly
but
how
was
i
to
know
in
my
poor
human
blindness
that
his
innocence
would
soon
be
established
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
by
other
means
than
the
publication
of
the
statement
which
he
had
so
strangely
placed
with
isobel
since
excepting
the
telegram
no
communication
had
reached
me
from
gatton
i
could
only
assume
that
he
had
discovered
nothing
in
the
ruins
of
the
bell
house
of
sufficient
importance
to
justify
a
report
doubtless
he
had
reported
to
new
scotland
yard
but
that
his
discoveries
if
any
had
not
resulted
in
an
arrest
was
painfully
evident
my
latest
contribution
to
the
had
been
in
the
nature
of
a
discursive
essay
rather
than
an
informative
article
although
i
had
enlivened
it
with
some
account
of
my
experiences
at
upper
crossleys
but
at
the
moment
that
i
had
set
pen
to
paper
i
had
realized
the
difficulty
of
expressing
within
the
scope
of
a
newspaper
contribution
the
peculiar
conditions
which
ruled
in
that
oddly
deserted
village
and
at
gatton
request
i
had
been
most
guarded
in
my
treatment
of
the
two
abortive
attempts
made
upon
my
own
life
by
the
eurasian
doctor
the
appeal
in
isobel
eyes
as
i
have
said
was
very
difficult
to
resist
but
after
all
i
had
little
substantial
consolation
to
offer
and
in
the
circumstances
i
shall
be
understood
i
think
when
i
say
that
it
was
with
an
odd
sense
of
relief
that
i
finally
took
my
departure
from
her
flat
to
long
for
the
right
to
comfort
a
woman
as
only
a
lover
may
do
and
to
suspect
that
this
sweet
privilege
might
have
been
his
for
the
asking
is
a
torture
which
no
man
can
suffer
unmoved
anticipating
almost
hourly
a
further
message
from
gatton
i
went
first
to
the
offices
but
although
i
lunched
at
the
club
and
returned
later
no
news
reached
me
there
whereupon
i
proceeded
to
my
cottage
as
i
walked
down
the
of
the
onetime
village
passing
that
at
which
so
far
as
my
part
in
it
was
concerned
the
first
scenes
of
the
drama
actually
had
been
laid
i
was
seized
with
wonder
on
reflecting
that
all
these
episodes
strange
and
tragic
had
been
crowded
into
so
short
a
space
of
time
an
officer
was
on
duty
there
as
on
the
night
when
i
had
first
made
acquaintance
with
the
green
eyes
of
the
woman
of
mystery
but
i
did
not
know
the
man
and
i
walked
on
deep
in
meditation
until
arriving
at
the
red
house
other
and
dreadful
reflections
were
aroused
by
the
sight
of
that
deserted
building
there
were
no
spectators
for
the
first
excitement
aroused
by
the
crime
had
begun
to
subside
and
i
did
not
even
notice
a
constable
posted
there
whereby
i
concluded
that
the
investigations
at
the
red
house
had
been
terminated
and
that
no
more
was
hoped
for
from
an
examination
of
those
premises
coates
was
awaiting
me
as
i
entered
my
cottage
with
the
news
that
inspector
gatton
had
telephoned
an
hour
before
from
crossleys
confirming
his
telegram
and
stating
that
he
would
call
immediately
he
arrived
in
london
this
was
stimulating
and
i
only
regretted
that
i
had
not
been
at
home
personally
to
speak
to
him
then
sir
eric
coverly
also
rang
up
sir
continued
coates
at
about
three
and
said
that
he
would
be
calling
this
evening
at
eight
in
accordance
with
your
request
i
looked
at
the
military
figure
standing
bolt
upright
just
within
the
doorway
good
is
that
all
i
asked
that
was
all
the
message
sir
he
reported
i
walked
into
the
study
in
a
very
thoughtful
mood
and
from
the
open
window
contemplated
that
prospect
of
road
now
for
ever
to
be
associated
in
my
mind
with
the
darkest
places
in
the
tragedy
in
which
i
had
so
strangely
become
involved
gatton
i
knew
entertained
a
theory
that
the
selection
of
the
red
house
for
the
dreadful
purpose
for
which
it
had
been
employed
was
not
the
result
of
any
mere
accident
but
was
ascribable
to
the
fact
that
the
place
was
conveniently
situated
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
assassin
in
short
he
had
an
idea
that
the
london
headquarters
of
the
wanted
man
whom
we
had
now
definitely
invested
with
the
personality
of
damar
greefe
was
somewhere
within
my
immediate
neighborhood
it
was
a
startling
conclusion
and
one
which
rested
as
i
thought
upon
somewhat
slender
premises
but
nevertheless
i
found
it
disquieting
and
recognizing
how
the
more
sinister
manifestations
of
that
singular
creature
whom
i
could
never
think
of
as
a
woman
nor
indeed
regard
as
anything
quite
human
were
associated
with
darkness
a
significantly
feline
trait
i
confess
to
a
certain
apprehension
respecting
the
coming
night
this
apprehension
was
strengthened
no
doubt
by
my
memories
of
gatton
last
words
as
i
had
been
on
the
point
of
setting
out
from
upper
crossleys
with
their
friar
park
base
destroyed
addison
he
had
said
they
will
be
forced
to
fly
to
that
other
abode
at
present
unknown
from
which
i
believe
they
conducted
the
elaborate
assassination
of
sir
marcus
the
only
alternative
is
flight
from
the
country
and
the
mechanism
of
the
having
been
put
into
motion
this
we
may
regard
as
almost
impossible
especially
in
view
of
the
marked
personality
of
damar
greefe
of
course
he
had
added
they
may
have
some
other
residence
of
which
we
know
nothing
but
i
incline
to
the
idea
that
they
will
make
for
london
that
the
published
paragraph
relating
to
eric
coverly
alleged
evidence
was
in
some
way
associated
with
this
theory
of
gatton
i
knew
but
of
the
soundness
of
his
theory
i
had
yet
to
learn
since
as
isobel
had
that
day
informed
me
the
document
lodged
with
her
was
a
profound
secret
from
all
carton
inspired
paragraph
could
have
been
no
more
than
a
shot
in
the
dark
and
the
fact
that
it
had
hit
the
mark
one
of
those
seeming
coincidences
which
sometimes
rest
upon
mere
chance
but
which
rested
in
this
case
upon
a
process
of
careful
reasoning
the
inspector
was
certain
as
i
was
certain
of
coverly
innocence
and
he
had
credited
him
with
an
alibi
because
he
knew
that
if
he
would
but
consent
to
break
his
inexplicable
silence
he
was
in
a
position
to
establish
one
why
he
had
forestalled
coverly
i
knew
not
i
made
a
poor
and
hasty
dinner
for
i
was
too
excited
to
eat
and
returning
to
the
study
i
crossed
to
the
bookcase
and
took
down
maspero
egyptian
art
i
idly
glanced
again
through
those
passages
which
gatton
had
copied
into
his
the
passages
relating
to
the
attributes
of
bâst
the
my
mind
rested
particularly
i
remember
upon
the
line
she
plays
with
her
victim
as
with
a
mouse
stifling
a
somewhat
weary
sigh
i
returned
the
book
to
its
place
and
lingered
looking
out
of
the
open
window
into
the
deepening
dusk
mentally
my
mood
was
a
restless
one
but
it
did
not
reflect
itself
physically
for
i
stood
there
leaning
against
the
window
whilst
a
procession
of
all
the
figures
associated
with
the
mystery
raced
through
my
mind
and
presently
as
i
stood
there
contemplating
a
mental
image
of
the
eurasian
doctor
i
heard
the
telephone
bell
ring
the
sound
aroused
me
in
a
moment
and
walking
out
into
the
little
in
which
the
instrument
was
placed
i
took
it
up
anticipating
coates
who
had
immediately
come
in
from
the
garden
where
he
was
engaged
at
the
time
hello
i
said
a
voice
with
which
i
was
unfamiliar
a
man
voice
speaking
rather
thickly
replied
is
that
mr
addison
yes
i
have
just
arrived
from
crossleys
with
inspector
gatton
he
requests
me
to
ask
you
to
meet
him
by
the
at
the
corner
of
the
high
street
immediately
very
good
i
said
i
will
come
and
continued
the
voice
could
you
spare
coates
with
the
car
for
an
hour
certainly
i
replied
for
what
do
you
want
him
if
he
will
take
the
car
to
denmark
hill
station
and
be
there
by
a
quarter
past
eight
continued
the
voice
blythe
will
meet
him
there
is
a
large
box
he
added
which
inspector
gatton
wishes
to
have
taken
to
your
house
very
well
i
said
coates
will
start
in
ten
minutes
time
and
i
will
come
along
immediately
to
meet
inspector
gatton
i
replaced
the
telephone
upon
the
little
table
and
went
out
into
the
garden
whither
my
man
had
returned
coates
i
said
get
out
the
rover
coates
immediately
ceased
his
gardening
operations
and
stood
upright
in
an
attitude
of
attention
very
good
sir
you
will
just
have
time
to
get
ready
at
the
garage
and
return
here
to
admit
sir
eric
coverly
at
eight
i
am
going
out
now
to
meet
inspector
gatton
but
inform
sir
eric
that
i
shall
be
back
in
a
few
minutes
show
him
into
the
study
and
make
him
comfortable
you
will
then
proceed
in
the
rover
to
denmark
hill
station
you
will
meet
there
a
man
with
a
box
a
detective
from
scotland
yard
who
will
make
himself
known
to
you
his
name
is
blythe
you
have
to
bring
the
box
back
here
very
good
sir
repeated
coates
and
as
he
entered
the
house
he
was
already
stripping
off
the
old
shooting
jacket
which
he
wore
in
the
garden
for
my
part
i
slipped
a
light
over
my
somewhat
untidy
house
attire
and
taking
my
hat
and
a
stick
stepped
quickly
out
along
the
road
in
the
direction
of
the
village
street
a
brisk
walk
brought
me
to
the
little
under
the
trees
but
gatton
was
not
to
be
seen
indeed
with
the
exception
of
several
ordinary
pedestrians
who
were
obviously
returning
from
the
city
to
their
homes
all
of
whom
i
scrutinized
thinking
that
coverly
might
come
this
way
and
the
constable
on
duty
at
the
point
there
was
no
one
about
who
looked
in
the
least
like
either
of
my
expected
visitors
having
waited
for
some
ten
minutes
unavailingly
i
spoke
to
the
man
in
the
box
good
evening
constable
i
said
i
expected
to
meet
a
friend
here
inspector
gatton
of
scotland
yard
you
may
know
him
i
know
of
him
quite
well
sir
answered
the
constable
and
should
recognize
him
if
i
saw
him
but
he
has
not
been
here
this
evening
you
have
seen
no
one
hanging
about
who
might
have
been
sent
by
him
no
one
sir
strange
i
muttered
then
my
name
is
addison
constable
i
said
and
if
any
one
should
ask
for
me
will
you
direct
him
to
proceed
to
my
house
and
i
gave
the
man
instructions
respecting
its
whereabouts
i
will
answered
the
constable
and
wishing
him
good
night
i
retraced
my
steps
curious
respecting
the
matter
but
not
apprehensive
as
i
well
might
have
been
and
with
no
glimmering
of
the
ghastly
truth
penetrating
to
my
mind
chapter
xxii
the
gray
mist
i
was
about
on
my
return
journey
when
i
heard
a
car
racing
along
the
road
behind
me
and
as
it
came
nearer
i
detected
the
fact
that
it
was
slowing
down
ere
i
could
turn
hi
mr
addison
hailed
a
voice
i
stopped
turned
round
and
there
was
gatton
leaning
out
of
the
car
and
staring
towards
me
through
the
deepening
dusk
why
gatton
i
said
walking
up
to
him
i
waited
more
than
ten
minutes
for
you
and
then
gave
it
up
waited
for
me
yes
by
the
he
stared
in
evident
wonder
at
me
and
then
at
the
police
chauffeur
who
drove
the
car
whatever
prompted
you
to
do
that
he
said
coates
must
have
given
you
the
wrong
message
i
said
i
would
come
to
the
house
for
you
not
meet
you
in
the
street
still
i
remained
dense
to
the
truth
and
i
know
you
did
i
replied
i
refer
to
the
second
message
i
sent
no
second
message
what
get
in
cried
gatton
shortly
this
wants
explaining
i
stepped
into
the
car
and
as
it
moved
onward
again
i
explained
to
the
inspector
what
had
taken
place
as
i
talked
i
saw
his
expression
grow
darker
and
darker
until
finally
there
something
wrong
he
muttered
then
you
did
not
inspire
the
message
i
know
nothing
whatever
about
it
at
the
time
you
received
it
i
was
on
my
way
from
crossleys
i
have
been
traveling
for
the
last
hour
and
a
half
i
stared
at
him
very
blankly
the
object
of
such
a
communication
was
difficult
to
imagine
and
i
knew
of
nothing
incriminating
in
my
possession
which
might
have
tempted
the
assassin
to
lure
me
from
the
house
whilst
he
obtained
possession
of
it
in
excitement
i
watched
the
houses
slipping
behind
us
as
we
swept
along
then
we
came
to
the
expanse
of
road
immediately
leading
to
the
cottage
as
the
car
stopped
i
leaped
out
quickly
gatton
close
upon
my
heels
and
ran
up
the
path
to
the
door
from
certain
indications
with
which
i
was
familiar
i
observed
that
coates
was
out
whereby
i
concluded
that
he
had
set
off
to
meet
the
mythical
man
with
a
box
not
without
apprehension
i
inserted
the
key
in
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
as
i
did
so
i
beheld
a
most
singular
spectacle
the
careful
coates
had
closed
all
the
windows
as
usual
before
quitting
the
house
so
that
there
was
comparatively
little
draught
along
the
corridor
but
as
the
door
swung
open
i
perceived
a
sort
of
gray
vapor
floating
over
the
carpet
about
a
foot
in
depth
and
moving
in
slightly
sinuous
spirals
upward
towards
the
opened
door
at
this
phenomenon
i
stared
in
speechless
astonishment
for
whilst
it
resembled
steam
or
the
early
morning
mist
which
one
sometimes
sees
upon
the
grass
in
hot
weather
i
was
wholly
at
a
loss
to
account
for
its
presence
inside
my
cottage
good
heavens
cried
gatton
and
grasped
me
by
the
arm
with
so
strong
a
grip
that
i
almost
cried
out
look
what
the
devil
is
it
i
muttered
and
turning
i
stared
into
his
face
what
it
be
stand
back
he
said
strangely
and
pulled
me
out
into
the
porch
do
you
notice
a
peculiar
smell
i
do
a
most
foul
and
abominable
smell
gatton
nodded
grimly
god
knows
what
has
happened
here
since
you
left
he
said
but
of
one
thing
i
am
sure
you
must
certainly
bear
a
charmed
life
addison
there
has
been
a
third
attempt
at
your
removal
this
choking
smell
which
now
rose
to
my
nostrils
had
in
it
something
vaguely
familiar
yet
something
which
at
that
place
and
that
time
i
found
myself
unable
to
identify
but
we
shall
have
to
open
the
windows
rapped
gatton
suiting
the
action
to
the
word
he
took
out
his
handkerchief
and
holding
it
to
his
nostrils
went
running
along
the
corridor
his
feet
oddly
enveloped
in
that
mysterious
mist
a
moment
later
i
heard
the
bang
of
a
swiftly
raised
window
then
another
and
stand
clear
of
the
door
called
a
muffled
voice
a
moment
later
gatton
came
racing
back
again
coughing
and
choking
because
of
the
fumes
which
arose
from
that
supernatural
fog
carpeting
the
passages
the
chauffeur
now
appeared
upon
the
path
leading
from
the
gate
to
the
porch
but
stay
by
the
car
ordered
gatton
do
move
without
instructions
i
scarcely
noted
his
words
for
i
was
watching
the
gray
fog
in
the
dusk
i
could
see
it
streaming
out
that
deathly
mist
and
creeping
away
across
grass
and
right
and
left
of
the
door
give
it
a
chance
to
clear
said
gatton
i
fancy
one
good
whiff
would
finish
any
man
even
as
he
spoke
the
words
the
nature
of
this
vapor
suddenly
occurred
to
me
and
the
abbey
inn
i
whispered
the
abbey
inn
ah
said
he
you
solved
the
mystery
have
you
but
can
you
explain
how
this
stuff
comes
to
be
floating
about
the
floor
of
your
house
i
can
not
i
confessed
but
at
all
costs
we
must
go
in
we
must
learn
the
worst
yes
we
risk
it
now
said
the
inspector
close
together
we
entered
and
made
our
way
towards
the
study
as
we
passed
the
of
the
in
which
the
telephone
was
placed
i
glanced
aside
and
thereupon
my
god
gatton
i
groaned
look
he
pulled
up
and
the
two
of
us
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
looking
into
the
little
room
i
have
said
that
coates
invariably
closed
the
windows
before
leaving
the
house
but
here
the
window
was
open
prone
upon
the
floor
was
stretched
the
figure
of
a
man
he
wore
a
light
overcoat
and
his
hat
lay
under
the
telephone
table
where
it
had
evidently
rolled
at
the
moment
of
his
fall
the
poisonous
smell
was
more
apparent
here
than
elsewhere
and
looking
down
at
the
prone
figure
the
face
of
which
was
indiscernible
because
of
the
man
position
why
gatton
i
said
in
an
awed
whisper
look
he
was
speaking
to
some
one
i
looking
replied
gatton
grimly
grasped
rigidly
in
his
left
hand
the
fallen
man
held
the
telephone
we
want
for
this
job
said
the
inspector
his
words
were
true
enough
i
had
already
recognized
the
odor
of
the
foul
stuff
it
was
identical
with
that
which
as
we
had
come
down
from
the
upper
floor
of
the
abbey
inn
had
proceeded
from
the
room
wherein
the
mysterious
shell
had
exploded
in
a
word
my
cottage
was
filled
with
some
kind
of
we
must
risk
it
anyway
said
gatton
and
find
out
who
it
is
i
nodded
sick
with
foreboding
stooping
swiftly
he
succeeded
in
turning
over
the
prone
figure
whereupon
i
quite
failed
to
restrain
a
hoarse
cry
of
horror
was
eric
the
room
seemed
to
swim
around
me
as
i
looked
down
at
the
dreadfully
contorted
features
over
which
was
creeping
that
greenish
tint
which
had
characterized
the
face
of
sir
marcus
as
i
had
seen
it
on
the
morning
of
the
body
recovery
from
the
hold
of
the
drag
him
out
said
gatton
huskily
he
may
be
alive
but
even
as
we
bent
to
the
attempt
both
my
companion
and
i
were
seized
with
violent
nausea
for
the
wisps
of
gray
mist
which
still
floated
in
the
air
were
nevertheless
sufficiently
deadly
however
we
succeeded
at
last
in
dragging
eric
coverly
into
the
passage
here
it
became
necessary
to
detach
the
telephone
from
the
in
which
he
held
it
i
turned
my
head
aside
whilst
gatton
accomplished
this
task
then
together
we
bore
coverly
out
into
the
porch
at
this
point
we
were
both
overcome
again
by
the
fumes
gatton
was
the
first
to
recover
sufficiently
to
stoop
and
examine
the
victim
of
this
fiendish
outrage
i
clutched
dizzily
at
an
upright
of
the
porch
and
do
tell
me
he
dead
i
whispered
but
gatton
stood
up
and
nodded
sternly
he
was
the
last
he
said
strangely
they
have
triumphed
after
all
the
man
who
had
driven
the
car
and
who
now
stood
in
a
state
of
evident
stupefaction
looking
over
the
gate
where
he
had
been
warned
to
remain
by
the
inspector
came
forward
on
seeing
gatton
beckoning
to
him
notify
the
local
officer
in
charge
and
bring
a
doctor
said
gatton
he
turned
to
me
which
is
the
nearest
rapidly
i
gave
the
man
the
necessary
instructions
and
he
went
running
out
to
the
car
and
soon
was
speeding
away
towards
the
house
of
a
local
physician
i
find
it
difficult
to
recapture
the
peculiar
horror
of
the
next
few
minutes
during
which
of
entering
the
cottage
gatton
and
i
stood
in
the
little
sheltered
garden
adjoining
the
porch
looking
down
at
the
body
of
this
man
who
had
met
his
end
under
my
roof
in
circumstances
at
once
dreadful
and
incomprehensible
tragically
eric
coverly
was
vindicated
by
his
death
he
was
proved
innocent
and
by
the
manner
of
his
death
we
realized
that
he
had
fallen
a
victim
to
the
same
malign
agency
as
his
cousin
i
have
explained
that
my
cottage
stood
in
a
strangely
secluded
spot
although
so
near
to
the
sleepless
life
of
london
and
i
remember
that
throughout
the
period
between
the
departure
of
the
man
with
the
car
and
his
return
with
the
doctor
and
two
police
officers
whom
he
had
brought
from
the
local
depôt
only
one
pedestrian
passed
my
door
and
he
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
how
little
that
chance
traveler
suspected
what
a
scene
was
concealed
from
his
eyes
by
the
tall
hedges
which
divided
the
garden
from
the
highroad
it
was
as
the
footsteps
of
this
wayfarer
became
faint
in
the
distance
that
suddenly
come
along
said
gatton
we
might
chance
it
now
i
want
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
this
telephone
trick
we
returned
to
the
door
of
the
and
side
by
side
stood
looking
down
at
the
telephone
which
had
only
been
extracted
from
the
grip
of
the
dead
man
with
so
much
difficulty
the
inspector
stooped
and
took
it
up
from
the
floor
the
deadly
gray
mist
was
all
but
dissipated
now
and
together
we
stood
staring
stupidly
at
the
telephone
which
gatton
held
in
his
hand
to
all
outward
seeming
it
was
an
ordinary
instrument
and
my
number
was
written
upon
it
in
the
space
provided
for
the
purpose
then
all
at
once
as
we
stepped
into
the
room
i
observed
something
out
of
the
ordinary
i
could
see
a
length
of
green
cable
proceeding
from
the
through
the
open
window
the
cable
attached
to
the
instrument
which
gatton
held
did
not
come
from
the
proper
connection
at
all
but
came
through
the
window
and
was
evidently
connected
with
something
outside
in
the
garden
what
does
this
mean
gatton
i
cried
evidently
as
deeply
mystified
as
i
gatton
placed
the
telephone
on
the
little
table
and
fully
opening
the
window
leaned
out
hullo
he
cried
the
cable
leads
up
to
the
roof
of
the
to
the
roof
of
the
i
echoed
incredulously
but
gatton
did
not
heed
my
words
for
what
the
devil
have
we
here
he
continued
he
was
hauling
something
up
from
the
below
the
window
and
now
turning
to
me
he
held
out
a
second
telephone
why
gatton
i
cried
and
took
it
from
his
hand
is
the
authentic
instrument
see
it
is
connected
in
the
proper
way
i
see
quite
clearly
he
replied
it
was
simply
placed
outside
whilst
a
duplicate
one
was
substituted
for
it
i
observe
a
ladder
against
the
shed
let
us
trace
the
cable
attached
to
the
duplicate
the
ladder
was
one
used
by
coates
about
the
garden
and
now
climbing
out
of
the
window
gatton
mounted
it
and
surveyed
the
roof
of
the
which
i
used
as
a
ha
he
exclaimed
a
gas
cylinder
what
he
fingered
the
green
cable
this
is
not
cable
at
all
he
cried
it
do
you
see
he
descended
and
rejoined
me
you
see
he
continued
a
call
from
the
exchange
would
ring
the
bell
in
the
here
this
devilish
contrivance
he
pointed
to
the
false
telephone
is
really
hollow
the
weight
of
the
receiver
hermetically
closes
the
end
of
the
tube
no
doubt
but
any
one
answering
the
call
and
taking
up
the
duplicate
instrument
would
receive
the
full
benefit
of
the
contents
of
the
cylinder
which
lies
up
there
on
the
roof
my
god
gatton
i
muttered
the
fiends
but
why
was
the
contrivance
not
removed
they
had
time
he
said
grimly
they
had
not
counted
on
the
of
the
victim
i
heard
a
car
come
racing
up
to
the
gate
followed
by
the
sound
of
many
excited
voices
at
last
we
know
where
the
gray
mist
came
from
i
said
as
gatton
and
i
walked
through
the
cottage
to
meet
the
new
arrivals
we
know
more
than
that
he
retorted
we
know
how
died
gatton
i
cried
excitedly
as
we
approached
a
group
waiting
in
the
porch
do
you
mean
he
looked
at
me
grimly
i
mean
he
said
slowly
that
i
have
not
forgotten
the
in
the
wall
of
that
recess
in
the
at
the
red
house
the
only
thing
i
was
doubtful
about
the
means
by
which
the
victim
was
induced
to
admit
the
gas
into
the
room
is
now
as
clear
as
daylight
you
are
right
gatton
i
agreed
the
same
trick
has
succeeded
twice
the
same
trick
as
you
say
addison
with
one
trifling
variation
a
device
which
would
only
suggest
itself
to
such
a
brain
as
that
of
damar
greefe
i
cried
i
believe
you
are
right
and
now
fell
an
awesome
silence
for
whilst
gatton
and
i
stood
the
unfortunate
eric
coverly
was
being
carried
out
to
the
waiting
car
and
even
as
i
turned
my
eyes
away
in
horror
from
that
spectacle
i
was
endeavoring
to
frame
the
words
in
which
i
should
acquaint
isobel
with
this
second
ghastly
tragedy
here
indeed
was
a
new
development
of
the
mystery
and
so
queerly
does
the
mind
depart
from
the
actualities
at
such
a
moment
that
i
found
myself
thinking
even
whilst
gatton
was
talking
to
me
of
the
bold
which
would
greet
readers
of
the
press
in
the
morning
and
of
the
renewed
excitement
which
would
sweep
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
when
this
dreadful
alibi
was
proven
over
the
details
of
that
gruesome
tragedy
i
feel
myself
compelled
to
pass
lightly
for
even
now
the
horror
of
it
remains
with
me
the
fumes
of
the
poisonous
gray
mist
lingered
for
hours
in
the
house
and
there
were
official
visitations
testimonies
and
attestations
and
the
hundred
and
one
formalities
which
invariably
accompany
such
a
tragedy
but
which
i
need
not
deal
with
in
detail
here
coates
returned
with
the
rover
just
as
the
body
of
the
victim
was
being
removed
and
his
account
of
what
had
occurred
was
simple
enough
and
followed
the
lines
which
we
had
anticipated
he
had
locked
up
and
then
gone
to
the
garage
for
the
car
as
i
had
directed
him
to
do
returning
to
the
cottage
in
time
to
admit
eric
coverly
whom
he
showed
into
the
study
having
informed
him
that
i
should
be
back
in
less
than
ten
minutes
he
had
then
proceeded
to
denmark
hill
railway
station
only
to
find
as
i
had
found
that
the
appointment
was
a
hoax
and
the
man
with
a
box
a
myth
you
see
said
gatton
the
scheme
of
the
plotter
was
simply
this
to
get
coates
out
of
the
way
for
a
long
enough
time
to
allow
the
substitution
of
the
telephone
to
be
accomplished
the
fact
that
coates
had
closed
the
windows
before
leaving
the
house
did
interfere
very
much
with
the
scheme
it
an
catch
on
the
window
and
i
have
seen
the
marks
upon
the
where
it
was
forced
from
the
outside
with
the
blade
of
a
knife
for
the
person
who
opened
the
window
to
take
out
the
real
telephone
and
put
the
other
in
its
place
was
easy
and
all
that
remained
was
to
lift
the
on
to
the
shed
and
partly
reclose
the
window
as
we
found
it
coates
even
if
he
had
troubled
to
look
would
not
have
noticed
any
difference
in
the
dusk
it
is
the
next
move
however
which
find
most
interesting
gatton
spoke
with
repressed
excitement
and
what
do
you
mean
by
next
move
i
asked
well
he
replied
we
have
good
evidence
to
show
that
the
assassin
possesses
an
almost
napoleonic
capacity
for
working
by
the
witness
the
employment
of
constable
bolton
in
the
red
house
affair
which
showed
that
our
man
was
perfectly
acquainted
with
the
movements
of
the
officer
on
that
beat
and
timed
his
scheme
accordingly
very
well
having
laid
the
telephone
trap
in
your
did
our
man
hurry
away
and
make
the
call
which
brought
coverly
to
the
or
did
he
remain
watching
the
house
and
give
the
signal
to
one
to
do
it
i
can
not
imagine
gatton
nor
does
the
point
strike
me
as
important
no
said
gatton
smiling
triumphantly
then
i
must
explain
whereas
in
the
red
house
the
scheme
worked
for
the
time
of
sir
marcus
arrival
was
in
the
present
instance
some
one
had
to
watch
for
return
from
the
mythical
appointment
for
return
unquestionably
this
scheme
was
arranged
for
your
benefit
addison
unknowingly
poor
coverly
saved
you
from
a
dreadful
fate
at
the
price
of
his
own
life
you
see
they
did
not
know
that
coverly
was
coming
here
now
it
will
not
have
escaped
your
attention
that
he
wore
a
soft
felt
hat
a
light
overcoat
and
carried
a
black
cane
so
did
when
you
went
out
to
keep
the
appointment
made
by
the
assassin
he
paused
staring
at
me
hard
and
whoever
was
watching
for
your
return
he
said
solemnly
mistook
coverly
for
you
the
moment
that
coates
drove
away
the
signal
was
given
it
have
been
we
were
back
here
a
few
minutes
later
do
you
see
i
do
not
gatton
what
are
you
driving
at
at
this
the
telephone
call
have
been
made
from
somewhere
in
the
immediate
neighborhood
there
was
time
to
do
it
otherwise
and
there
is
no
public
call
office
within
a
mile
is
open
after
seven
good
heavens
i
cried
at
last
i
understand
gatton
looked
at
me
smiling
in
grim
triumph
and
damar
greefe
has
a
residence
somewhere
within
a
radius
of
this
house
he
declared
he
has
betrayed
himself
then
look
here
unscrewing
the
front
of
the
mouthpiece
of
the
false
telephone
he
took
out
the
strip
of
cardboard
upon
which
my
number
was
written
turned
it
over
and
there
upon
the
back
was
another
number
just
look
up
he
said
he
was
the
last
occupant
of
the
red
house
and
may
still
be
in
the
book
grasping
the
purpose
of
his
inquiry
excitedly
i
did
as
he
directed
and
there
sure
enough
the
number
appeared
the
identical
instrument
that
was
used
at
the
red
house
cried
gatton
note
the
artistic
finish
with
which
even
the
exchange
numbers
are
looked
up
i
sank
back
in
my
chair
silent
appalled
at
the
perverted
genius
of
this
fiend
whom
we
were
pitted
against
in
a
struggle
but
presently
what
was
the
object
of
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
garage
doors
at
the
red
house
i
asked
almost
mechanically
simple
enough
gatton
replied
whereas
here
the
telephone
was
installed
so
that
the
bell
could
be
rung
by
some
one
merely
calling
up
your
number
and
the
ringing
stopped
by
the
caller
telling
the
exchange
he
had
made
a
mistake
in
the
red
house
as
i
have
discovered
the
had
been
disconnected
shortly
after
left
the
place
then
the
opening
and
closing
of
the
doors
was
merely
a
device
for
ringing
the
bell
yes
the
opening
of
the
first
door
set
it
ringing
and
the
opening
of
the
second
probably
stopped
it
addison
he
stood
up
resting
his
hands
upon
the
table
and
regarding
me
fixedly
we
enter
upon
the
final
battle
of
wits
new
scotland
yard
damar
greefe
and
the
lady
of
bâst
regarding
the
latter
there
is
a
very
significant
point
what
is
that
the
on
this
last
occasion
was
that
not
of
a
woman
but
of
a
man
chapter
xxiii
the
inevitable
i
very
much
regret
having
to
trouble
you
miss
merlin
at
such
a
time
said
inspector
gatton
but
as
the
paper
lodged
with
you
by
the
late
sir
eric
coverly
may
throw
some
light
upon
a
very
dark
matter
perhaps
you
will
read
it
to
us
i
watched
the
play
of
expression
upon
isobel
face
with
a
depth
of
sympathy
which
i
can
not
attempt
to
describe
the
successive
trials
which
had
been
imposed
upon
her
in
so
short
a
time
had
robbed
her
cheeks
of
their
sweet
color
and
there
were
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
the
tumult
of
my
own
feelings
was
such
that
i
was
scarcely
capable
of
consistent
thought
nor
had
i
the
moral
courage
to
examine
those
emotions
which
stirred
so
wildly
within
me
late
on
the
previous
night
i
had
performed
the
unhappy
duty
of
breaking
to
her
the
news
of
coverly
dreadful
death
i
shall
never
forget
that
black
hour
her
courage
however
under
all
these
trials
had
been
admirable
and
although
i
well
knew
what
it
must
have
cost
her
she
replied
now
with
perfect
composure
look
i
took
it
out
of
my
bureau
when
i
heard
that
you
were
here
inspector
she
took
up
from
the
table
a
foolscap
envelope
sealed
and
having
her
name
written
upon
it
in
large
and
somewhat
unsteady
characters
i
would
suggest
said
gatton
with
a
delicacy
which
earned
my
gratitude
that
you
read
it
yourself
first
miss
merlin
if
there
is
anything
helpful
in
it
you
can
then
communicate
it
to
me
i
saw
isobel
biting
her
lip
hard
but
she
resolutely
tore
open
the
envelope
and
leaving
her
to
read
the
contents
i
joined
gatton
at
the
window
we
both
stood
staring
out
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
time
then
it
is
rather
long
said
isobel
in
a
low
voice
gatton
and
i
turned
together
and
saw
her
looking
even
more
pale
than
before
seated
by
the
table
holding
a
sheet
of
notepaper
in
her
hand
without
glancing
at
either
of
us
she
began
to
read
as
follows
in
an
even
and
monotonous
voice
which
i
knew
she
had
adopted
to
hide
her
emotion
this
account
of
my
movements
on
the
night
of
august
will
only
be
read
in
the
event
of
my
being
falsely
adjudged
guilty
of
the
murder
of
my
cousin
marcus
coverly
or
in
the
event
of
my
death
on
the
afternoon
of
that
date
i
was
informed
over
the
telephone
that
my
fiancée
isobel
merlin
was
meeting
sir
marcus
the
same
night
at
a
place
called
the
red
house
the
address
was
given
me
and
i
was
asked
in
case
i
doubted
the
word
of
the
speaker
to
watch
miss
merlin
movements
that
evening
i
had
already
quarreled
with
my
cousin
respecting
his
unwelcome
attentions
and
although
the
result
did
not
confirm
the
promise
of
the
informant
in
part
at
least
the
information
was
accurate
i
have
no
idea
of
the
speaker
identity
except
that
the
voice
was
the
voice
of
a
woman
not
desiring
to
trust
any
one
in
such
a
matter
i
myself
obtained
in
a
remote
district
the
dilapidated
garments
which
are
now
in
the
possession
of
the
police
and
respecting
which
they
have
subjected
me
to
close
examination
attired
in
these
and
having
my
face
and
hands
artificially
dirtied
as
a
further
disguise
i
left
my
chambers
by
a
back
entrance
about
nine
and
not
having
sufficient
confidence
in
my
to
enter
a
public
vehicle
walked
the
whole
of
the
way
to
college
road
i
had
little
difficulty
in
finding
the
red
house
but
on
discovering
that
it
was
vacant
i
immediately
suspected
a
hoax
however
i
determined
to
wait
in
the
neighborhood
until
the
time
at
which
the
voice
had
warned
me
the
meeting
was
to
take
place
there
were
very
few
people
about
and
a
tremendous
downfall
of
rain
drenched
me
to
the
skin
for
the
only
shelter
afforded
was
that
of
the
trees
bordering
the
road
unless
i
had
been
content
to
abandon
my
watch
just
before
the
downpour
ceased
but
after
it
had
abated
its
first
fury
i
came
out
from
my
inadequate
shelter
and
began
to
walk
in
the
direction
of
the
high
street
i
had
not
gone
more
than
twenty
paces
when
i
saw
a
cab
approaching
and
the
man
seeing
my
bedraggled
figure
slowed
up
and
to
my
astonishment
asked
me
the
way
to
the
red
house
i
immediately
peered
into
the
cab
to
find
that
the
passenger
was
none
other
than
marcus
coverly
i
had
begun
to
doubt
but
at
this
i
doubted
no
longer
i
gave
the
cabman
the
necessary
directions
and
slowly
following
on
foot
i
saw
from
the
shelter
of
the
trees
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
road
sir
marcus
dismiss
the
cab
and
walk
up
the
drive
of
the
empty
house
he
was
alone
and
since
i
knew
that
miss
merlin
had
not
preceded
him
i
could
only
conclude
that
she
would
be
following
later
accordingly
i
walked
slowly
away
from
the
red
house
again
in
the
direction
of
the
high
street
and
some
five
minutes
later
i
passed
a
constable
accompanied
by
a
man
wearing
a
light
burberry
and
a
soft
hat
whom
i
knew
later
although
i
failed
to
recognize
him
at
the
time
to
have
been
jack
addison
i
stood
at
the
corner
by
the
high
street
until
long
after
midnight
twice
i
returned
to
the
red
house
and
once
even
penetrated
as
far
as
the
porch
but
although
i
thought
i
could
detect
a
light
shining
out
through
the
shutters
of
the
room
on
the
right
of
the
door
i
could
not
be
sure
of
it
and
there
was
no
sound
of
movement
within
these
were
my
only
discoveries
and
very
wretched
and
dissatisfied
i
tramped
back
to
my
chambers
wondering
what
the
visit
of
marcus
coverly
to
this
apparently
empty
house
could
mean
and
why
he
had
remained
there
but
particularly
wondering
why
the
voice
had
told
me
this
which
had
turned
me
into
a
spy
unavailingly
the
discovery
made
at
the
docks
on
the
following
day
placed
a
new
and
dreadful
construction
upon
the
motives
of
the
speaker
and
i
awakened
to
the
fact
that
although
entirely
innocent
of
any
complicity
i
had
laid
myself
open
to
a
charge
of
having
been
concerned
in
the
murder
of
my
cousin
my
attempt
to
conceal
the
garments
which
i
had
used
as
a
disguise
and
of
which
i
had
not
known
how
to
dispose
was
dictated
by
panic
i
knew
the
police
were
watching
me
and
i
was
fool
enough
to
think
that
i
could
escape
their
vigilance
this
is
all
i
have
to
say
it
explains
nothing
and
it
does
not
exonerate
me
i
am
aware
but
i
swear
that
it
is
the
truth
signed
eric
coverly
bart
although
she
retained
so
brave
a
composure
i
recognized
the
strain
which
this
new
and
cruel
ordeal
had
imposed
upon
isobel
and
gatton
incurred
a
further
debt
of
gratitude
by
his
tactful
behavior
for
miss
merlin
he
said
earnestly
you
are
a
very
brave
woman
thank
you
i
only
wish
i
could
have
spared
you
this
shaking
me
warmly
by
the
hand
he
bowed
and
departed
leaving
me
alone
with
isobel
as
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
died
away
isobel
returned
again
to
the
seat
from
which
she
had
risen
and
a
silence
fell
between
us
my
own
feelings
i
can
not
attempt
to
depict
but
i
will
confess
that
i
was
afraid
of
my
humanity
at
that
moment
never
had
isobel
seemed
more
desirable
never
had
i
longed
as
i
longed
now
to
take
her
in
my
arms
the
tension
of
that
silence
becoming
insupportable
you
will
not
stay
here
alone
i
asked
in
an
unnatural
voice
isobel
without
looking
up
shook
her
head
i
am
going
to
wentworth
my
aunt
alison
she
replied
good
i
said
i
am
glad
to
know
that
you
will
be
in
her
cheery
company
wentworth
was
indeed
a
charming
old
lady
and
so
far
as
i
knew
isobel
only
relation
in
london
if
not
in
england
she
occupied
a
house
which
like
herself
was
small
scrupulously
neat
and
one
of
those
tiny
residences
which
once
counted
as
being
in
the
country
had
later
become
enmeshed
in
the
tentacles
of
greater
london
it
was
situated
on
the
northern
outskirts
of
the
and
although
rows
of
modern
villas
had
grown
up
around
it
within
the
walls
of
that
quaint
little
homestead
one
found
oneself
far
enough
removed
from
suburbia
when
are
you
going
isobel
i
asked
i
think
she
replied
in
the
morning
will
you
let
me
drive
you
in
the
rover
or
are
you
taking
too
much
baggage
oh
no
she
said
smiling
sadly
i
am
going
to
live
the
simple
life
for
a
week
going
out
shopping
with
aunt
alison
and
perhaps
sometimes
to
the
pictures
then
i
can
drive
you
over
yes
if
you
would
like
to
she
answered
simply
i
took
my
leave
shortly
afterwards
and
proceeded
to
the
office
i
had
work
to
do
but
i
must
admit
that
i
little
relished
the
idea
of
returning
to
my
cottage
diverted
now
from
the
notorious
red
house
public
interest
had
centered
upon
my
residence
and
the
seclusion
which
i
had
gone
so
far
to
seek
was
disturbed
almost
hourly
by
impertinent
callers
who
seemed
to
think
that
the
scene
of
a
sensational
crime
was
public
property
coates
had
effectually
disillusioned
several
of
them
on
this
point
but
nevertheless
the
cottage
had
become
distasteful
to
me
i
realized
that
i
must
seek
a
new
residence
without
delay
shall
i
add
that
the
primary
cause
of
my
reclusion
no
longer
operated
so
powerfully
of
my
dreams
at
this
time
i
will
speak
later
but
here
i
may
say
that
i
knew
and
accepted
the
knowledge
with
a
fearful
joy
that
if
my
new
house
of
hope
was
doomed
to
be
shattered
no
spot
in
broad
england
could
offer
me
rest
again
it
was
not
then
until
late
that
night
that
i
returned
to
my
once
peaceful
abode
coates
was
waiting
up
for
me
but
he
had
nothing
of
importance
to
report
apparently
until
when
i
had
dismissed
him
he
turned
in
the
doorway
and
excuse
me
sir
he
said
and
cleared
his
throat
yes
coates
about
half
an
hour
ago
sir
the
dogs
all
around
started
howling
sir
i
thought
i
better
mention
it
as
inspector
gatton
asked
me
this
morning
if
i
had
ever
heard
the
dogs
howling
i
looked
at
him
straightly
inspector
gatton
asked
you
thus
he
did
sir
so
i
have
reported
the
occurrence
good
night
sir
good
night
coates
i
replied
but
for
long
enough
after
his
departure
i
sat
there
in
the
armchair
in
my
study
thinking
over
this
seemingly
trivial
occurrence
from
where
i
sat
i
could
see
the
light
shining
upon
the
title
of
maspero
egyptian
art
and
my
thoughts
promised
to
be
ill
bedfellows
contrary
to
custom
i
slept
that
night
with
closed
windows
and
although
i
awakened
twice
once
at
two
and
again
at
four
thinking
that
i
had
heard
the
mournful
signal
of
the
dogs
nothing
but
my
own
uneasy
imagination
disturbed
my
slumbers
breakfast
despatched
and
my
correspondence
dealt
with
i
sent
coates
to
the
garage
for
my
little
car
and
since
i
should
have
another
companion
left
him
behind
and
myself
drove
to
isobel
flat
she
was
not
nearly
ready
and
there
was
much
bustling
on
the
part
of
the
repentant
marie
who
had
been
retained
in
spite
of
her
share
in
the
tragedy
of
sir
marcus
death
before
we
finally
set
out
for
wentworth
isobel
was
very
silent
on
the
way
but
once
i
intercepted
a
sidelong
glance
and
felt
my
heart
leaping
madly
when
she
blushed
wentworth
made
me
very
welcome
as
had
ever
been
her
way
she
was
an
eccentric
but
embarrassingly
straightforward
old
lady
and
if
i
had
heeded
her
simple
motherly
counsel
in
the
past
all
might
have
been
different
she
bore
isobel
off
to
her
room
leaving
me
to
my
own
devices
for
she
had
never
observed
any
ceremony
towards
me
in
all
the
years
that
i
had
known
her
but
had
taught
me
to
make
myself
at
home
beneath
her
hospitable
roof
i
knew
too
because
she
had
never
troubled
to
disguise
the
fact
that
she
regarded
isobel
and
me
as
made
for
one
another
isobel
engagement
to
poor
eric
coverly
wentworth
had
all
along
regarded
as
a
ghastly
farce
and
i
can
never
forget
her
reception
of
me
on
the
occasion
of
my
first
visit
after
returning
from
mesopotamia
half
an
hour
or
so
elapsed
then
before
isobel
returned
and
although
she
came
into
the
room
confidently
enough
the
old
tension
reasserted
itself
immediately
i
felt
that
commonplaces
would
choke
me
and
although
to
this
day
i
can
not
condone
my
behavior
for
the
good
of
my
soul
i
must
confess
the
truth
i
took
her
in
my
arms
held
her
fast
and
kissed
her
an
overwhelming
consciousness
of
guilt
came
to
me
even
as
her
lips
met
mine
and
releasing
her
i
turned
aside
groaning
isobel
i
said
hoarsely
isobel
forgive
me
i
was
a
cad
a
villain
to
but
it
was
inevitable
try
to
forget
that
i
was
so
weak
but
isobel
i
felt
her
hand
trembling
on
my
arm
we
must
try
to
forget
jack
she
whispered
i
grasped
her
hands
and
looked
eagerly
indeed
i
think
wildly
into
her
eyes
because
my
life
is
over
if
i
lose
you
i
said
i
suppose
i
was
mad
for
a
moment
tell
me
that
one
day
when
it
is
fit
and
proper
that
you
should
do
so
you
will
give
me
a
hearing
and
i
will
perform
any
penance
you
choose
i
acted
like
a
blackguard
stop
she
commanded
softly
she
raised
her
eyes
and
her
grave
sweet
glance
cooled
the
fever
which
consumed
me
and
brought
a
great
and
abiding
peace
to
my
heart
you
were
no
more
to
blame
than
i
she
said
and
because
i
understand
it
is
not
hard
to
forgive
i
do
try
to
excuse
myself
but
even
if
had
lived
i
could
never
have
gone
on
with
it
after
his
suspicions
oh
jack
why
did
you
leave
me
to
make
that
awful
mistake
my
dearest
i
replied
god
knows
i
have
suffered
for
it
please
she
said
and
her
voice
faltered
help
me
to
be
fair
to
never
never
speak
to
me
again
like
that
until
but
the
sentence
was
never
completed
for
at
this
moment
in
bustled
aunt
alison
in
appearance
a
little
matron
very
brisk
in
her
movements
and
very
a
dear
old
lady
dearer
than
ever
to
me
in
that
she
had
tried
so
hard
to
bring
isobel
and
my
laggard
self
together
she
had
as
usual
more
to
say
than
could
be
said
in
the
time
at
her
disposal
as
we
proceeded
to
the
now
then
you
boys
and
girls
i
starving
if
you
not
what
a
time
i
had
with
cook
not
knowing
when
you
might
be
here
leaving
to
be
married
i
afraid
she
neglected
this
dear
dear
what
love
will
do
for
people
minds
to
be
sure
put
your
hair
straight
isobel
dear
or
mary
will
think
jack
has
been
kissing
you
i
saw
her
kiss
the
postman
yesterday
mary
i
mean
you
eating
like
a
pigeon
jack
gracious
me
where
the
pepper
mary
ring
the
bell
isobel
i
must
speak
to
that
postman
he
made
mary
forget
to
put
any
pepper
in
the
cruet
and
any
one
might
have
seen
them
it
respectable
dear
aunt
alison
i
said
as
the
active
old
lady
ran
out
mary
not
being
promptly
enough
in
attendance
she
loves
to
keep
running
in
and
out
like
a
waiter
what
a
friend
she
has
been
to
me
isobel
you
could
not
be
in
better
company
at
such
a
time
she
a
darling
agreed
isobel
and
when
i
met
her
glance
across
the
table
she
blushed
entrancingly
then
in
a
moment
tears
were
in
her
eyes
and
knowing
of
whom
she
was
thinking
i
sat
abashed
guilty
and
repentant
i
had
transgressed
against
the
murdered
man
and
there
and
then
i
made
a
solemn
silent
vow
that
no
word
of
love
again
should
pass
my
lips
until
the
fit
and
proper
time
of
mourning
was
over
because
i
faithfully
kept
this
vow
i
dare
to
hope
that
my
sin
is
forgiven
me
luncheon
at
that
homely
house
with
isobel
was
an
unalloyed
delight
and
i
regretted
every
passing
minute
which
brought
me
nearer
to
the
time
when
i
must
depart
but
when
at
last
i
said
it
was
a
new
world
upon
which
i
looked
a
new
life
upon
which
i
entered
i
have
said
that
i
venture
to
hope
my
poor
human
transgression
is
forgiven
me
yet
it
did
not
go
unpunished
little
did
i
dream
in
my
strange
new
happiness
how
soon
i
was
to
return
to
that
house
how
soon
i
was
to
know
the
deadliest
terror
of
my
life
chapter
xxiv
a
conference
interrupted
the
case
has
narrowed
down
said
gatton
from
my
point
of
view
into
the
quest
of
one
man
damar
greefe
precisely
you
have
asked
me
what
i
found
at
friar
park
and
the
bell
house
and
i
can
answer
you
very
briefly
nothing
the
latter
place
had
quite
obviously
been
fired
in
a
systematic
and
deliberate
way
i
suspect
that
the
contents
of
the
rooms
had
been
soaked
with
petrol
it
burned
to
a
shell
and
then
collapsed
at
the
present
moment
it
is
merely
a
mound
of
smoking
ashes
of
course
the
local
was
hopelessly
but
even
with
the
most
appliances
i
doubt
if
the
conflagration
could
have
been
extinguished
the
men
watching
the
house
were
thrown
quite
off
their
guard
when
flames
began
to
leap
out
of
the
windows
hence
the
escape
of
damar
greefe
you
are
sure
he
escape
gatton
stared
at
me
grimly
to
whom
do
you
suppose
you
are
indebted
for
the
telephone
trick
he
asked
besides
blythe
the
fool
actually
heard
the
car
at
the
moment
that
it
came
out
on
to
the
highroad
oh
they
bungled
the
thing
villainously
my
marathon
feat
saved
your
life
addison
but
it
looks
like
losing
me
the
case
we
have
the
hawkins
couple
but
although
a
graceless
pair
they
were
more
dupes
than
knaves
i
am
convinced
personally
that
neither
of
them
suspected
that
lady
burnham
coverly
was
dead
damar
greefe
had
represented
to
them
that
she
had
lost
her
reason
good
heavens
what
a
scheme
what
a
scheme
indeed
hawkins
seems
to
have
considered
that
his
duty
which
was
merely
to
keep
intruders
out
of
the
park
was
dictated
by
necessity
he
thought
that
if
lady
coverly
real
condition
became
known
she
would
be
removed
to
a
madhouse
he
also
thought
that
a
was
in
attendance
a
nurse
yes
he
assured
me
that
he
had
heard
and
seen
her
hawkins
also
was
certain
on
the
point
neither
of
them
were
ever
allowed
in
the
house
by
the
way
but
damar
greefe
paid
them
well
and
they
were
satisfied
the
identity
of
the
is
evident
i
think
perfectly
evident
but
how
was
poor
lady
coverly
disposed
of
and
why
this
elaborate
secrecy
well
replied
gatton
slowly
out
of
the
multitude
of
notes
which
i
have
compiled
upon
the
case
i
have
worked
out
a
sort
of
summary
and
it
amounts
to
this
the
whole
series
of
outrages
turns
upon
something
in
the
financial
arrangements
of
the
late
sir
burnham
of
benefit
to
the
eurasian
doctor
it
may
be
that
damar
greefe
had
some
secret
locked
up
in
the
bell
house
which
he
could
not
very
well
remove
and
that
the
greatest
peril
he
feared
was
the
taking
over
of
the
park
property
by
an
heir
i
assume
he
had
complete
authority
over
the
late
lady
burnham
and
his
object
in
concealing
her
death
for
our
investigations
at
friar
park
have
definitely
established
the
fact
that
no
one
had
resided
there
for
twelve
months
at
least
was
clearly
this
he
hoped
to
carry
on
the
pretense
of
attending
upon
the
invalid
until
until
there
was
no
heir
to
the
property
remaining
alive
i
interrupted
excitedly
exactly
gatton
that
is
my
own
theory
too
we
have
now
received
continued
the
inspector
some
particulars
concerning
the
circumstances
of
roger
coverly
death
in
basle
whilst
there
was
no
direct
evidence
of
foul
play
and
at
that
time
at
any
rate
no
reason
to
suspect
it
i
am
convinced
that
the
local
physician
who
attended
him
at
the
hotel
and
the
specialist
who
was
sent
for
from
zurich
were
by
no
means
agreed
as
to
the
cause
of
death
the
symptoms
were
apparently
not
unlike
those
which
would
be
caused
by
a
for
instance
but
naturally
one
does
not
look
for
poisonous
snakes
in
switzerland
there
was
some
sort
of
inflammation
of
the
skin
apparently
he
consulted
a
page
of
his
which
might
have
been
eczema
or
something
similar
of
course
but
which
according
to
medical
evidence
had
no
apparent
connection
with
the
cause
of
his
death
this
was
given
in
the
certificate
simply
as
syncope
although
there
did
not
appear
to
be
any
hereditary
cardiac
trouble
or
anything
of
the
kind
to
account
for
a
young
fellow
of
that
age
dying
suddenly
of
heart
failure
and
there
had
been
nothing
in
his
life
during
his
sojourn
at
basle
which
would
help
to
clear
up
the
mystery
however
no
doubt
seems
to
have
arisen
at
the
time
as
you
can
well
understand
nevertheless
i
personally
count
the
death
of
roger
coverly
as
the
first
of
the
outrages
to
be
laid
to
the
credit
of
damar
greefe
the
object
of
the
whole
thing
is
still
completely
dark
to
me
i
declared
in
a
sense
it
is
dark
to
replied
gatton
but
considering
that
the
boy
died
at
a
time
when
the
health
of
his
father
sir
burnham
was
already
giving
cause
for
anxiety
i
maintain
that
he
was
removed
because
his
inheritance
of
friar
park
was
feared
by
some
one
the
invitation
from
damar
greefe
to
sir
marcus
is
a
very
significant
piece
of
evidence
of
course
and
when
we
consider
that
it
reached
sir
marcus
within
a
very
short
time
of
his
return
from
russia
the
conclusion
is
obvious
he
inherited
the
title
on
the
death
of
sir
burnham
whilst
he
was
on
service
in
archangel
being
in
russia
i
conclude
that
he
was
not
accessible
from
the
eurasian
doctor
point
of
view
directly
he
accessible
this
invitation
arrived
and
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
fate
intended
for
him
was
that
which
so
nearly
befell
yourself
remember
i
have
seen
the
gun
mounted
on
the
tower
of
friar
park
and
i
assure
you
it
was
not
placed
there
yesterday
in
short
i
have
no
doubt
that
it
was
put
there
in
anticipation
of
sir
marcus
visit
and
only
employed
in
your
case
as
a
sort
of
afterthought
the
red
house
plot
was
the
next
move
on
the
part
of
the
eurasian
and
it
succeeded
almost
faultlessly
the
accident
at
the
docks
prevented
the
scheme
being
carried
out
in
all
its
details
but
it
did
not
entirely
dislocate
the
murderer
arrangements
for
it
left
us
with
no
better
clew
to
his
identity
than
the
statuette
of
the
cat
the
presence
of
that
statuette
calls
for
some
explanation
gatton
i
said
gatton
very
carefully
lighted
his
pipe
that
is
true
he
admitted
but
i
will
come
to
this
side
of
the
case
later
at
present
i
am
summing
up
the
evidence
against
damar
greefe
who
is
certainly
the
acting
partner
in
this
series
of
outrages
against
the
members
of
the
house
of
coverly
observe
the
ingenuity
of
the
red
house
plot
he
hoped
by
this
not
only
to
bring
about
the
death
of
sir
marcus
but
also
by
conviction
for
his
murder
the
death
of
the
next
heir
eric
coverly
in
fact
so
well
was
his
plan
conducted
that
even
now
although
we
know
poor
sir
eric
to
have
been
innocent
you
will
note
that
he
has
been
unable
to
establish
an
alibi
even
by
a
full
confession
of
his
movements
on
the
night
of
the
crime
in
other
words
if
he
had
not
fallen
a
victim
to
the
precipitancy
of
his
enemies
his
name
would
be
under
as
black
a
cloud
as
ever
it
was
with
the
idea
of
clearing
him
that
i
caused
those
paragraphs
to
be
distributed
to
the
press
in
which
i
anticipated
the
existence
of
such
a
confession
as
he
had
actually
made
but
i
may
add
of
one
more
convincing
than
that
which
we
heard
miss
merlin
read
do
you
mean
gatton
i
said
looking
hard
at
him
that
by
professing
to
have
established
the
innocence
of
eric
coverly
you
hoped
to
draw
down
upon
him
the
renewed
activities
of
his
enemies
gatton
looked
rather
guilty
but
i
do
admit
it
he
said
nevertheless
he
did
not
fall
a
victim
to
this
trap
which
i
had
laid
for
him
in
his
own
best
interests
after
all
you
must
admit
that
his
death
was
an
accident
for
he
suffered
the
penalty
of
your
misdeeds
my
misdeeds
i
cried
gatton
smiled
grimly
i
say
misdeeds
he
continued
although
they
were
not
conscious
on
your
part
but
it
is
fairly
evident
i
think
that
whereas
the
unknown
partner
of
damar
greefe
was
an
active
enemy
of
the
coverlys
witness
the
evidence
of
voice
and
of
the
cat
statuette
it
is
to
damar
greefe
that
you
are
indebted
for
the
three
attempts
on
your
life
the
first
two
at
upper
crossleys
and
the
third
here
in
your
own
home
by
the
simple
but
deadly
expedient
of
substituting
for
your
own
the
duplicate
one
which
previously
had
been
employed
so
successfully
at
the
red
house
he
hoped
to
remove
a
dangerous
obstacle
from
his
path
and
a
menace
to
this
safety
but
my
dear
gatton
why
should
he
regard
as
a
menace
more
deadly
than
you
for
instance
the
reason
is
very
plain
answered
gatton
i
do
think
he
paid
you
the
compliment
of
regarding
your
investigations
as
likely
to
prove
more
successful
than
my
own
but
i
do
think
that
he
apprehended
danger
from
the
indiscretions
of
his
lady
accomplice
do
you
refer
to
the
woman
who
visited
me
at
the
abbey
inn
i
do
said
gatton
shortly
and
to
the
woman
who
visited
you
here
and
stole
the
statuette
of
bâst
the
history
of
edward
hines
and
his
predecessor
which
you
have
so
admirably
summarized
points
to
the
presence
in
the
upper
crossleys
neighborhood
of
such
a
character
as
we
have
been
seeking
ever
since
your
experience
here
i
refer
to
the
which
looked
in
through
the
window
i
begin
to
see
gatton
i
said
slowly
with
what
object
this
unknown
woman
visited
you
at
the
abbey
inn
i
can
not
conjecture
but
doubtless
this
would
have
been
revealed
had
not
her
visit
been
interrupted
and
terminated
by
the
appearance
of
the
eurasian
doctor
upon
the
scene
from
your
own
account
she
recognized
that
she
had
committed
an
indiscretion
by
coming
there
and
of
the
doctor
anger
which
he
was
quite
unable
to
conceal
you
have
told
me
note
also
that
the
next
episode
was
your
being
followed
by
cassim
the
nubian
undoubtedly
with
murderous
intent
then
recognizing
that
he
had
hopelessly
compromised
himself
the
eurasian
took
desperate
means
to
silence
you
for
ever
he
did
i
said
and
came
very
near
to
succeeding
but
to
return
gatton
to
this
problem
of
the
image
of
bâst
you
see
the
figure
of
a
cat
was
painted
upon
the
case
in
which
sir
marcus
body
was
found
and
the
image
of
a
cat
was
discovered
inside
the
case
then
you
will
not
have
overlooked
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
edward
hines
was
the
recipient
of
a
present
from
his
unknown
friend
which
also
took
the
form
of
a
gold
figure
of
a
cat
and
which
i
found
when
i
examined
it
to
be
of
ancient
egyptian
workmanship
right
said
gatton
and
emphatically
bringing
his
open
hand
down
upon
the
table
i
said
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
case
addison
that
it
turned
upon
the
history
of
this
egyptian
goddess
and
i
think
my
theory
has
been
substantiated
at
every
point
it
has
inspector
i
agreed
but
i
do
know
that
the
fact
enlightens
us
very
much
for
it
merely
indicates
that
the
man
whom
you
declare
to
be
the
central
figure
of
the
conspiracy
is
only
a
secondary
figure
and
that
all
we
know
about
the
person
whom
we
may
regard
as
the
prime
mover
is
that
she
is
a
woman
apparently
possessing
supernormal
eyes
which
glitter
in
the
dark
she
is
also
associated
in
some
way
with
the
figure
of
bâst
what
is
her
relation
to
damar
greefe
and
in
what
way
is
she
interested
in
the
destruction
of
the
coverly
family
gatton
smoked
in
silence
for
a
while
staring
at
me
reflectively
then
if
we
knew
that
addison
he
said
we
should
know
all
there
is
to
know
about
mystery
but
i
think
we
should
have
advanced
a
long
step
towards
this
information
if
we
could
apprehend
the
eurasian
of
course
we
have
gathered
up
all
the
ragged
details
of
the
red
house
incident
i
refer
to
the
carter
who
delivered
the
crate
and
collected
it
in
the
morning
of
the
caterer
who
supplied
the
supper
and
so
forth
as
i
had
fully
expected
none
of
the
evidence
helped
us
at
all
voice
i
began
exactly
the
same
beyond
a
doubt
and
the
whole
thing
worked
through
the
means
of
district
messengers
and
others
telephonically
instructed
no
one
appeared
throughout
mr
addison
yet
i
said
deliberately
there
was
one
point
at
which
some
one
have
appeared
yes
he
interrupted
some
one
dragged
the
body
out
of
that
down
to
the
garage
and
packed
it
in
the
crate
you
have
definitely
convinced
yourself
that
the
telephone
device
was
practiced
there
beyond
question
have
you
seen
the
exchange
number
that
plug
where
at
some
time
a
had
been
fixed
up
in
the
wall
you
remember
proved
on
investigation
to
communicate
with
an
empty
room
adjoining
the
gas
cylinder
was
placed
there
of
course
and
the
telephone
in
the
recess
of
the
where
fastened
in
by
the
velvet
curtain
any
one
using
the
poison
installation
would
be
suffocated
almost
immediately
good
god
gatton
i
cried
it
a
horrible
business
and
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
idea
what
the
next
step
should
be
i
a
bit
doubtful
myself
admitted
gatton
but
you
know
the
line
of
reasoning
which
has
led
me
to
the
conclusion
that
these
people
possess
a
base
of
operations
somewhere
in
this
district
i
am
having
the
neighborhood
scoured
pretty
thoroughly
and
i
think
it
is
merely
a
question
of
time
now
for
us
to
hem
in
the
wanted
man
and
the
wanted
woman
i
added
we
were
interrupted
by
a
knock
at
the
study
door
and
coates
came
in
with
the
evening
mail
excuse
me
gatton
i
said
for
i
had
observed
that
one
of
the
letters
was
from
isobel
eagerly
i
tore
open
the
envelope
and
what
i
read
struck
a
sudden
chill
to
my
heart
looking
up
gatton
i
cried
miss
merlin
has
received
by
post
a
small
statuette
of
bâst
what
from
her
brief
description
i
am
almost
tempted
to
believe
that
it
is
the
one
which
was
stolen
from
here
she
is
dreadfully
frightened
naturally
the
inspector
stood
up
we
must
see
it
he
said
rapidly
at
once
and
we
must
see
the
wrapping
it
came
in
and
the
postmark
it
is
maddening
he
burst
out
angrily
to
think
that
damar
greefe
may
be
somewhere
within
less
than
half
a
mile
of
us
as
we
sit
here
now
that
we
could
ring
him
up
if
we
knew
his
number
but
that
even
with
all
the
resources
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
at
work
we
may
yet
be
unable
to
find
him
even
an
outside
suburb
like
this
is
a
very
big
place
to
search
and
the
job
is
something
like
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack
my
own
frame
of
mind
was
one
of
horrible
doubt
and
indecision
i
knew
not
what
to
do
for
the
best
and
gatton
had
begun
to
pace
up
and
down
like
a
caged
wild
beast
therefore
fill
your
pipe
i
said
wearily
a
lot
may
depend
upon
our
next
move
to
make
a
false
one
would
perhaps
be
fatal
gatton
stared
at
me
almost
savagely
then
threw
himself
back
into
the
armchair
from
which
he
had
arisen
and
was
just
reaching
out
for
the
which
i
had
pushed
before
him
when
a
bell
rang
i
heard
coates
opening
the
front
door
and
wondering
whom
this
late
visitor
could
be
i
stared
questioningly
at
the
inspector
came
a
tap
upon
the
door
come
in
i
cried
coates
entered
and
standing
stiffly
in
the
doorway
damar
he
announced
unmoved
he
stood
aside
and
whilst
gatton
and
i
slowly
rose
from
our
chairs
in
a
state
of
utter
stupefaction
the
eurasian
doctor
entered
and
stood
a
tall
gaunt
figure
towering
over
the
burly
form
of
coates
in
the
doorway
his
hawk
eyes
blazed
feverishly
and
his
face
was
drawn
and
haggard
whilst
i
observed
with
a
sort
of
horrified
wonder
that
he
seemed
to
be
almost
too
weak
to
stand
for
as
gatton
and
i
came
finally
to
our
feet
he
clutched
at
the
edge
of
a
bookcase
but
recovered
himself
bowed
in
that
stately
fashion
which
immediately
translated
me
in
spirit
to
the
strange
library
in
the
bell
house
and
gentlemen
he
said
and
his
harsh
voice
rose
scarcely
above
a
whisper
pray
resume
your
seats
i
shall
not
detain
you
long
chapter
xxv
statement
of
damar
greefe
the
speaker
reeled
and
seemed
about
to
fall
whereupon
gatton
sprang
forward
and
placed
an
armchair
which
he
himself
had
occupied
for
damar
greefe
the
latter
inclined
his
head
in
acknowledgment
and
sank
down
weakly
clutching
at
both
arms
of
the
chair
for
my
own
part
i
had
not
yet
recovered
power
of
speech
but
damar
greefe
said
the
inspector
closely
watching
the
man
who
sat
there
collapsed
in
the
chair
i
arrest
you
on
a
charge
of
murder
i
have
to
warn
you
that
anything
you
now
say
will
be
used
in
evidence
against
you
the
eurasian
exerted
a
supreme
effort
straightening
his
gaunt
body
and
fixing
the
gaze
of
those
hawk
eyes
upon
inspector
gatton
when
he
spoke
his
harsh
voice
had
gained
strength
and
his
manner
was
imperious
gatton
he
replied
you
do
no
more
than
your
duty
i
have
come
here
only
with
the
utmost
difficulty
in
my
weak
state
therefore
you
need
apprehend
no
attempt
at
escape
on
my
part
i
have
come
with
a
purpose
this
purpose
i
shall
fulfill
after
which
he
shrugged
his
square
shoulders
i
shall
be
at
your
service
very
good
said
gatton
shortly
but
i
noted
that
his
face
was
flushed
in
a
way
which
betokened
repressed
excitement
giving
me
a
significant
glance
he
went
out
to
the
and
sydenham
i
heard
him
call
damar
greefe
closed
his
eyes
and
lay
back
in
the
chair
and
a
moment
later
hullo
said
gatton
gatton
speaking
from
willow
cottage
college
road
send
two
men
in
a
cab
here
at
once
to
remove
a
prisoner
right
he
came
in
again
and
closing
the
door
behind
him
stood
staring
at
damar
greefe
in
a
sort
of
wonderment
the
eurasian
wearily
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
slowly
from
side
to
side
then
pray
be
seated
inspector
gatton
he
said
i
have
a
communication
to
make
gatton
with
never
a
word
drew
up
a
chair
and
sat
down
i
do
not
desire
to
be
interrupted
continued
damar
greefe
until
my
communication
is
finished
you
understand
it
will
not
be
repeated
i
am
afraid
murmured
gatton
dryly
it
will
have
to
be
the
eurasian
fully
opened
his
glittering
black
eyes
and
fixing
them
upon
the
speaker
it
will
not
be
repeated
he
said
harshly
if
i
am
misunderstood
inform
me
his
peremptory
manner
in
the
circumstances
was
extraordinary
uncanny
as
i
had
perceived
in
the
first
hour
of
our
meeting
damar
greefe
was
a
man
possessing
tremendous
force
of
character
and
a
pride
of
intellect
which
clearly
rendered
him
indifferent
even
of
retribution
this
point
being
settled
he
continued
be
good
enough
inspector
gatton
and
he
turned
his
eyes
in
my
direction
addison
to
give
me
your
undivided
attention
his
manner
was
that
of
a
lecturer
of
a
lecturer
who
takes
it
for
granted
that
his
discourse
is
above
the
heads
of
his
audience
but
when
i
say
that
the
statement
now
made
by
this
strange
and
terrible
man
held
gatton
and
me
spellbound
i
say
no
more
than
the
truth
wearily
and
more
often
than
not
having
his
eyes
closed
damar
greefe
commenced
to
unfold
a
story
of
nameless
horrors
and
save
that
his
harsh
voice
grew
ever
weaker
and
weaker
he
displayed
not
the
slightest
trace
of
emotion
throughout
his
appalling
revelations
i
am
informing
you
he
said
of
these
facts
concerning
my
inquiries
in
the
realm
of
teratology
and
the
subjoined
province
of
animism
because
i
know
that
my
upon
this
subject
can
never
now
be
completed
it
having
been
necessary
for
me
to
destroy
my
papers
and
those
specimens
which
at
hideous
cost
i
had
accumulated
during
twenty
years
of
travel
through
some
of
the
most
barbaric
as
well
as
the
most
civilized
parts
of
the
world
this
present
brief
verbal
account
of
the
most
important
inquiry
of
all
shall
alone
survive
me
you
are
privileged
therefore
listen
two
important
facts
contributed
to
my
choice
of
a
special
study
the
social
ostracism
which
very
early
in
my
professional
career
i
found
to
be
my
lot
and
the
fact
that
in
myself
i
afforded
a
living
example
of
the
it
has
been
said
and
not
untruly
that
the
eurasian
hates
his
father
and
scorns
his
mother
certainly
this
unnatural
passion
is
reciprocated
by
the
parent
stock
for
the
eurasian
is
barely
acknowledged
by
his
dark
brethren
and
hardly
tolerated
by
the
white
in
spite
of
my
qualifications
i
am
a
doctor
of
medicine
a
master
of
arts
and
hold
other
degrees
of
leipzig
the
sorbonne
and
elsewhere
i
recognized
very
early
in
my
career
that
ordinary
practice
was
impossible
for
me
i
therefore
turned
my
attention
to
the
special
study
of
embryology
as
i
fortunately
possessed
sufficient
private
means
to
enable
me
by
careful
living
to
dispense
with
the
usual
proceeds
of
my
profession
in
short
i
hoped
to
triumph
over
my
hereditary
handicap
and
to
build
for
myself
a
reputation
which
should
rise
above
the
petty
disabilities
of
caste
and
place
my
name
upon
a
level
with
those
of
haeckel
weismann
wallace
focke
and
the
other
great
students
who
have
helped
to
advance
our
knowledge
of
the
science
of
evolution
i
early
turned
my
attention
to
the
traditions
associated
with
the
or
sacred
baboon
of
abyssinia
i
took
up
my
quarters
on
the
banks
of
the
hawash
and
succeeded
in
ingratiating
myself
with
the
amharûn
the
result
of
my
sojourn
amongst
these
strange
people
is
embodied
in
my
work
of
shoa
this
work
is
unpublished
and
may
never
see
the
light
but
briefly
i
may
state
that
the
amharûn
are
a
semitic
tribe
allied
to
the
falashas
and
have
been
settled
for
many
generations
in
this
southern
province
of
abyssinia
claiming
descent
from
menelek
son
of
suleiman
and
the
queen
of
sheba
they
have
always
been
regarded
as
unclean
pariahs
in
part
this
is
due
to
their
bestial
custom
of
eating
meat
cut
from
living
animals
but
it
is
more
particularly
attributable
to
the
periodical
appearance
among
them
of
these
or
which
form
the
subject
of
my
work
my
close
inquiries
into
the
physiological
history
of
these
monstrosities
were
only
conducted
with
the
utmost
difficulty
in
the
first
place
i
found
that
it
was
customary
among
the
amharûn
to
slay
the
creatures
at
birth
but
in
those
rare
cases
of
survival
the
were
banished
from
the
community
and
were
compelled
to
lead
a
wild
life
subsisting
as
best
they
might
in
the
foothills
of
the
desolate
mountain
region
thus
in
the
first
place
these
creatures
were
difficult
of
access
in
the
second
place
they
readily
contracted
tuberculosis
even
in
that
warm
dry
climate
and
in
the
third
place
their
ferocity
rendered
them
more
formidable
to
approach
than
any
tiger
in
its
lair
i
may
add
here
that
this
predisposition
to
pulmonary
disease
is
and
this
i
have
definitely
established
a
characteristic
of
all
mammalian
hybrids
nevertheless
my
studies
were
by
no
means
unfruitful
since
they
resulted
in
a
triumphant
vindication
of
my
theory
which
contrary
to
that
universally
received
and
more
closely
allied
to
the
mendel
law
ascribed
the
appearance
of
such
monsters
not
to
any
strict
physiological
process
but
to
a
hitherto
unclassified
law
of
embryology
which
i
had
hoped
would
one
day
take
its
place
in
science
under
my
name
armed
with
the
results
of
my
abyssinian
inquiry
i
next
proceeded
to
syria
for
among
certain
desert
tribes
i
hoped
to
find
further
evidence
to
support
my
theory
in
short
in
the
arabic
tradition
of
the
which
is
allied
to
the
medieval
and
universal
belief
in
the
or
and
in
the
indian
myth
of
the
woman
who
possessing
an
ordinary
human
form
by
day
assumes
that
of
a
tigress
by
night
i
thought
i
detected
a
profound
truth
since
my
is
destroyed
i
am
egotist
enough
to
desire
that
credit
for
it
should
not
accrue
to
another
i
do
not
propose
therefore
more
than
lightly
to
touch
upon
the
damar
greefe
law
but
i
may
say
that
in
its
essentials
it
is
this
such
strange
hybrids
do
actually
occur
periodically
and
in
rare
cases
survive
but
their
animal
proclivities
which
are
physically
demonstrable
and
the
possession
of
certain
animal
attributes
as
the
furry
body
of
the
the
claws
and
teeth
of
the
etc
are
reflections
of
a
process
taking
place
in
the
female
parent
he
glared
at
me
wildly
as
if
anticipating
contradiction
but
gatton
and
i
remaining
silent
there
is
no
physical
association
he
continued
between
the
hybrid
and
that
creature
whose
qualities
and
peculiarities
he
seemingly
inherits
i
have
proved
by
a
long
series
of
elaborate
experiments
that
a
hybrid
of
this
description
is
a
physiological
impossibility
but
that
a
hybrid
such
as
i
have
indicated
may
appear
is
a
fact
which
does
not
rest
solely
upon
my
studies
amongst
the
amharûn
nor
upon
my
subsequent
inquiries
throughout
assyria
somaliland
and
the
middle
valleys
of
the
yellow
river
he
paused
and
suddenly
turning
a
glance
of
the
eyes
upon
me
as
an
explorer
of
the
dark
continent
addison
he
said
and
also
if
i
mistake
not
something
of
an
orientalist
the
significance
of
this
itinerary
may
possibly
be
apparent
to
you
but
i
waste
time
the
discovery
which
triumphantly
crowned
my
life
work
by
what
some
may
deem
poetic
justice
was
destined
also
to
destroy
it
this
brings
me
to
the
matter
which
has
led
to
my
presence
here
my
preceding
remarks
were
a
necessary
foreword
i
come
to
the
year
when
i
was
established
in
cairo
whither
i
had
conveyed
the
results
of
the
labor
of
many
years
and
where
i
had
taken
up
my
quarters
in
a
large
native
house
not
twenty
yards
from
the
gatton
stirred
restlessly
in
his
chair
and
my
own
curiosity
knew
no
bounds
my
inquiries
at
this
time
had
nearly
exhausted
my
always
slender
financial
resources
and
the
proceeds
of
a
small
practice
which
i
succeeded
in
establishing
exclusively
amongst
the
extensive
colony
resident
in
this
neighborhood
proved
a
welcome
addition
to
my
income
it
was
due
to
the
fact
that
at
this
time
i
was
an
active
practitioner
that
i
came
in
touch
with
the
most
perfect
and
notable
example
of
a
which
i
had
ever
encountered
indeed
which
so
far
as
i
am
aware
has
ever
appeared
he
paused
again
as
if
overcome
with
faintness
and
in
anticipation
of
what
was
to
come
i
could
scarcely
contain
myself
when
at
this
time
he
resumed
in
a
yet
lower
voice
and
indeed
until
quite
recently
there
were
but
few
reliable
european
medical
men
in
cairo
and
during
the
summer
of
an
outbreak
of
cholera
temporarily
depleted
their
already
scanty
ranks
it
happened
then
that
one
night
whilst
i
sat
in
the
huge
lofty
room
once
the
principal
harem
apartment
of
the
house
which
i
had
appropriated
as
a
study
cassim
my
nubian
servant
communicated
to
me
by
means
of
a
which
i
had
taught
him
some
startling
news
my
immediate
presence
was
desired
at
the
residence
of
sir
burnham
coverly
then
newly
appointed
to
a
government
office
and
who
with
his
wife
had
only
arrived
in
the
country
some
few
months
earlier
i
thought
i
knew
the
nature
of
the
services
required
of
me
but
my
employment
by
this
typical
english
aristocrat
with
caste
traditions
as
he
could
not
fail
to
be
since
he
had
spent
five
years
of
his
official
life
in
india
surprised
me
very
greatly
i
was
later
to
learn
that
the
services
of
no
other
medical
man
or
of
no
medical
man
so
highly
qualified
as
myself
were
available
but
even
had
i
known
this
at
the
time
i
should
have
put
my
pride
in
my
pocket
and
for
this
reason
i
had
learned
from
a
native
acquaintance
of
a
certain
occurrence
which
had
taken
place
on
the
very
day
of
the
baronet
arrival
in
egypt
and
it
led
me
to
look
for
a
particular
manifestation
in
fact
i
will
boldly
declare
since
science
is
admittedly
a
callous
mistress
that
it
had
led
me
to
for
this
manifestation
however
unpleasant
it
might
prove
for
those
intimately
concerned
accordingly
having
made
suitable
preparation
i
accompanied
sir
burnham
servant
back
to
the
residence
of
the
baronet
i
heard
the
ring
and
i
heard
coates
regular
tread
as
he
proceeded
along
the
passage
there
was
a
brief
muttered
colloquy
a
rap
on
the
and
coates
entered
a
sergeant
of
police
and
a
constable
sir
to
see
inspector
gatton
damar
greefe
raised
his
thin
yellow
hand
his
voice
when
next
he
spoke
exhibited
no
trace
of
emotion
let
them
be
told
to
wait
he
said
i
have
not
finished
it
was
wildly
bizarre
that
scene
in
my
study
with
the
dignified
eurasian
doctor
palpably
laboring
against
some
deathly
sickness
sitting
there
unperturbed
his
brilliant
perverted
intellect
holding
him
aloof
from
the
ordinary
things
of
life
whilst
those
who
came
to
hale
him
to
a
felon
cell
waited
in
the
i
glanced
swiftly
at
gatton
and
he
nodded
impatiently
let
them
stay
in
the
coates
i
said
make
them
comfortable
very
good
sir
unmoved
coates
withdrew
and
i
saw
gatton
glance
at
his
watch
throughout
the
latter
part
of
his
strange
narrative
neither
gatton
nor
i
interrupted
the
narrator
therefore
i
give
his
story
so
far
as
i
remember
it
in
his
own
words
he
no
longer
addressed
either
of
us
directly
he
seemed
indeed
to
be
thinking
aloud
chapter
xxvi
statement
of
damar
greefe
continued
as
i
walked
along
through
the
deserted
native
streets
for
the
hour
was
late
i
reviewed
mentally
the
circumstances
of
that
affair
already
several
months
old
to
which
i
have
referred
since
it
proved
to
have
a
very
important
bearing
upon
my
own
life
and
unfortunately
the
lives
of
many
others
i
will
briefly
recount
it
here
sir
burnham
and
lady
coverly
having
arrived
at
port
said
were
proceeding
by
rail
to
cairo
when
an
accident
farther
up
the
line
necessitated
their
breaking
their
journey
at
zagazig
now
for
a
time
in
the
spring
of
the
previous
year
i
had
devoted
much
labor
to
an
inquiry
in
this
place
which
stands
of
course
roughly
upon
the
site
of
the
ancient
egyptian
city
of
in
those
myths
or
myths
of
the
ancient
egyptian
religion
which
represented
the
various
attributes
of
man
in
the
guises
of
animals
i
had
perceived
a
nucleus
of
wisdom
pointing
to
the
possibility
that
the
law
which
i
had
so
laboriously
established
might
have
been
known
to
the
early
egyptian
priesthood
indeed
i
was
partly
induced
to
inquire
into
the
myths
of
bâst
the
goddess
to
whom
of
old
this
town
was
dedicated
by
the
following
two
things
first
a
chance
reference
in
the
pages
of
herodotus
and
second
a
persistent
superstition
that
during
a
certain
season
of
the
year
occurred
in
this
town
by
dint
of
close
research
i
discovered
that
the
date
favored
by
the
inhabitants
of
zagazig
as
that
upon
which
such
creatures
were
born
there
corresponded
very
closely
with
the
sacred
sothic
month
formerly
sacred
to
bâst
the
titulary
goddess
of
the
place
corresponded
in
short
with
the
ancient
feast
of
bâst
my
inquiries
at
the
time
however
proved
futile
and
beyond
the
fact
that
the
town
was
remarkable
for
a
singular
number
of
cats
i
discovered
nothing
to
support
my
theory
however
as
i
have
already
stated
a
native
acquaintance
there
a
very
learned
moslem
to
whom
i
had
imparted
during
my
residence
some
idea
of
the
nature
of
my
studies
sent
me
a
long
communication
containing
particulars
of
the
event
which
had
befallen
lady
coverly
during
her
sojourn
in
zagazig
briefly
she
had
learned
from
a
native
attached
to
the
one
possible
hotel
which
the
town
boasted
of
the
tradition
associated
with
the
place
some
other
member
of
the
party
for
quite
a
large
company
had
been
detained
in
zagazig
by
the
mishap
unwisely
pointed
out
to
her
that
the
favored
date
was
that
upon
which
they
had
arrived
in
the
town
nothing
might
have
resulted
from
this
but
by
a
strange
fatality
or
because
of
the
operation
of
some
unsuspected
law
understood
by
the
ancients
but
misapprehended
the
matter
was
sealed
in
a
very
extraordinary
fashion
lady
coverly
room
opened
upon
a
balcony
and
during
the
night
one
of
those
huge
cats
of
the
kind
which
i
had
observed
myself
to
infest
the
neighborhood
gained
access
to
this
balcony
since
the
appearance
of
the
creature
produced
so
singular
and
disastrous
an
effect
it
must
certainly
have
been
an
unusually
large
specimen
of
its
kind
i
may
add
that
according
to
my
moslem
friend
who
although
a
man
of
great
culture
was
soaked
in
the
traditions
of
his
religion
it
was
none
other
than
a
member
of
the
an
or
evil
spirit
and
not
a
cat
of
flesh
and
blood
which
appeared
to
lady
coverly
i
leave
each
to
choose
his
own
explanation
but
let
it
suffice
that
lady
coverly
was
awakened
some
time
during
the
night
by
the
appearance
at
her
bedside
of
this
gaunt
and
creature
the
result
was
an
illness
of
a
kind
very
dangerous
to
one
in
her
delicate
state
of
health
reflecting
then
upon
these
matters
i
presently
came
to
the
official
residence
of
sir
burnham
coverly
and
my
expectations
regarding
the
nature
of
the
case
were
realized
footnote
part
of
the
statement
which
immediately
followed
being
of
a
purely
technical
nature
is
omitted
here
my
house
in
the
narrow
street
so
near
to
the
and
the
minarets
of
muayyâd
was
admirably
adapted
for
my
new
purpose
for
here
in
the
very
heart
of
native
cairo
with
my
great
house
which
had
been
built
as
are
all
oriental
houses
to
guard
secrets
i
was
as
safe
from
unwelcome
intrusion
as
one
upon
a
desert
island
whilst
at
the
same
time
i
was
denied
none
of
the
conveniences
and
facilities
of
civilization
lady
coverly
then
never
set
eyes
upon
her
firstborn
and
sir
burnham
who
did
readily
reconciled
himself
to
the
loss
of
such
a
daughter
the
announcement
which
should
have
appeared
joyfully
under
the
births
was
unobtrusively
inserted
under
deaths
and
sir
burnham
being
fortunately
far
from
the
haunts
of
the
social
paragraph
writers
this
unfortunate
event
aroused
comparatively
little
comment
in
the
english
journals
beyond
one
or
two
formal
condolences
it
passed
unnoticed
the
fever
of
research
at
last
had
led
me
into
my
first
definite
crime
against
society
if
so
it
can
be
called
i
had
rescued
alive
the
most
perfect
example
of
a
with
which
throughout
my
extensive
special
inquiries
i
had
ever
come
in
contact
lady
coverly
never
knew
her
unnatural
child
and
sir
burnham
as
well
as
the
old
family
nurse
who
had
accompanied
them
out
from
england
never
doubted
that
it
had
died
in
the
hour
of
birth
i
set
to
work
with
enthusiasm
upon
my
last
and
greatest
experiment
to
a
woman
upon
whom
i
knew
i
could
rely
for
she
was
deeply
indebted
to
me
i
entrusted
the
fostering
of
the
infant
hybrid
i
personally
supervised
every
detail
of
the
secret
nursery
cassim
procuring
for
me
everything
necessary
for
the
rearing
of
this
delicate
and
fragile
creature
over
the
early
years
of
her
life
i
will
hasten
on
three
occasions
i
despaired
of
preserving
her
existence
which
from
the
beginning
had
hung
by
a
thread
the
first
crisis
came
when
she
was
only
four
months
old
the
second
on
the
occasion
of
her
fourth
birthday
and
the
third
most
serious
of
all
when
she
was
eleven
at
which
age
she
had
become
a
woman
in
the
oriental
sense
and
was
physically
and
mentally
comparable
with
an
ordinary
european
girl
of
nineteen
or
twenty
with
what
scientific
ardor
did
i
study
her
development
noting
how
the
traits
at
certain
periods
corresponding
to
the
feast
of
bâst
proclaimed
themselves
above
the
human
traits
whilst
at
other
times
the
sank
into
a
sort
of
quietude
leaving
the
subject
almost
a
normal
woman
of
the
physical
reflections
which
were
the
visible
evidence
of
her
hybrid
mentality
i
have
already
spoken
at
length
refers
to
a
portion
of
the
statement
which
has
been
she
invariably
wore
gloves
out
of
doors
and
a
veil
to
conceal
the
chatoyant
eyes
she
could
as
i
have
explained
see
as
well
in
the
dark
as
in
daylight
and
her
agility
was
phenomenal
as
was
her
power
of
climbing
having
her
hands
and
feet
bare
i
have
repeatedly
seen
her
climb
to
the
top
platform
of
the
tower
of
friar
park
at
the
age
of
eleven
then
i
recognized
that
the
balance
of
character
was
definitely
established
and
that
the
two
outstanding
characteristics
of
the
subject
were
firstly
a
hereditary
trait
of
the
coverlys
an
intense
pride
of
race
and
a
fierce
jealousy
of
any
infringement
upon
what
she
regarded
as
prerogatives
of
birth
secondly
a
susceptibility
to
sudden
infatuations
which
invariably
terminated
in
a
mood
of
ferocious
cruelty
to
one
unacquainted
with
the
orient
thus
to
speak
of
this
girl
in
years
a
mere
child
as
one
speaks
of
a
mature
woman
would
seem
strange
if
not
unnatural
but
in
the
east
of
course
at
the
age
of
ten
a
girl
is
counted
marriageable
at
the
age
of
fourteen
she
is
not
infrequently
the
devoted
mother
of
a
family
significantly
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
damar
greefe
law
my
ward
had
grown
up
not
as
english
girls
grow
but
like
the
easterners
as
the
flower
grows
the
point
has
intense
interest
for
the
scientist
at
the
age
of
twelve
she
was
a
tall
slender
woman
beautifully
formed
and
with
a
natural
elegance
and
taste
which
came
from
the
coverly
stock
or
possibly
from
her
mother
side
during
eleven
months
of
every
year
it
would
have
been
possible
although
i
considered
it
undesirable
for
her
to
have
appeared
in
public
unveiled
she
possessed
features
of
perfect
egyptian
i
emphasize
the
point
her
eyes
during
the
day
were
those
of
a
handsome
native
woman
and
of
a
wonderful
amber
color
at
night
they
appeared
green
of
her
fingers
toes
and
the
peculiar
formation
of
certain
teeth
i
have
spoken
at
length
reference
to
a
deleted
i
will
deal
now
with
those
manifestations
which
proclaimed
themselves
during
the
sothic
month
of
each
year
formerly
associated
with
the
feast
of
bâst
at
such
times
which
i
always
dreaded
and
with
good
cause
her
innate
love
of
admiration
became
so
excessive
as
to
approach
nearly
to
mania
she
hungered
for
homage
for
praise
i
had
almost
said
for
adoration
what
i
may
term
for
convenience
the
side
of
her
hybrid
mentality
at
these
periods
undoubtedly
bordered
closely
upon
true
insanity
and
learning
from
the
eurasian
nurse
to
whom
i
have
referred
the
whole
history
of
her
birth
my
charge
to
whom
i
had
given
the
name
of
nahémah
students
will
recognize
its
significance
began
to
display
even
more
marked
evidence
of
a
sort
of
monomania
bâst
the
became
an
obsession
with
her
and
she
finally
conceived
the
idea
that
the
attributes
of
that
mystical
and
deity
were
active
within
her
that
she
was
bâst
and
certainly
during
one
month
of
every
year
her
condition
closely
resembled
that
which
was
termed
in
the
middle
ages
possession
at
such
times
moreover
a
phenomenon
with
which
i
have
dealt
at
length
in
my
work
on
the
subject
she
evinced
an
antipathy
towards
the
whole
of
the
species
which
was
reciprocated
in
a
singular
way
thus
when
contrary
to
my
express
orders
she
has
wandered
abroad
during
the
sothic
period
i
have
been
enabled
to
trace
her
movements
by
the
progressive
howling
of
dogs
since
i
had
enjoined
the
nurse
to
be
silent
upon
all
things
bearing
upon
nahémah
birth
i
was
enraged
at
this
breach
of
faith
and
sent
the
woman
away
but
a
new
situation
had
been
created
which
i
found
myself
called
upon
immediately
to
face
nahémah
demanded
news
of
her
family
as
i
have
made
sufficiently
evident
it
was
often
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
thwart
the
desires
of
my
protegée
to
condense
into
a
few
words
a
matter
which
occasioned
me
long
and
anxious
thought
i
may
say
that
i
made
the
necessary
arrangements
for
quitting
the
house
near
to
the
mosque
of
muayyâd
which
had
been
my
home
for
fifteen
years
i
recognized
the
danger
of
nahémah
traveling
in
the
ordinary
way
and
she
performed
the
journey
to
england
in
the
character
of
an
invalid
under
my
professional
care
equally
residence
at
any
public
establishment
was
out
of
the
question
and
although
i
found
myself
compelled
for
a
time
to
court
discovery
by
lodging
nahémah
in
a
private
suite
in
an
obscure
hotel
i
hastened
to
seek
a
house
in
some
quiet
suburb
which
should
reproduce
as
nearly
as
possible
the
advantages
of
my
abode
in
cairo
such
a
house
i
discovered
after
about
a
week
of
feverish
questing
for
apart
from
the
ordinary
dangers
of
discovery
to
which
my
protegée
was
subject
her
proclivity
for
adventures
at
the
most
unseasonable
times
greatly
enhanced
the
danger
which
i
apprehended
judge
then
of
my
satisfaction
when
i
succeeded
in
obtaining
the
lease
of
a
small
villa
indeed
i
might
almost
term
it
a
bungalow
in
one
of
those
odd
survivals
of
less
crowded
days
which
are
yet
counted
suburbs
or
parts
of
greater
london
this
house
stood
alone
in
some
two
acres
of
ground
and
because
of
its
lack
of
modern
conveniences
and
the
comparative
inaccessibility
of
its
position
my
application
was
eagerly
entertained
by
the
agent
interested
in
the
leasing
of
the
property
one
week
later
i
entered
into
possession
cassim
nahémah
and
myself
comprising
the
entire
household
much
of
my
valuable
indeed
i
may
say
unique
collection
i
had
been
compelled
to
store
for
my
new
quarters
lacked
the
necessary
space
for
the
purpose
but
although
i
was
unaware
of
the
fact
at
the
time
i
was
not
destined
to
be
long
deprived
of
a
suitable
home
for
the
records
of
my
life
work
nahémah
demand
for
some
understanding
between
herself
and
her
family
grew
daily
more
insistent
but
i
might
have
continued
to
oppose
her
wishes
had
it
not
been
for
the
fact
that
by
this
time
my
slender
resources
were
almost
exhausted
it
suddenly
became
evident
to
me
that
i
held
in
my
hand
an
instrument
whereby
i
might
force
sir
burnham
coverly
to
finance
the
new
experiments
upon
which
i
had
entered
at
this
time
with
all
the
enthusiasm
that
a
love
for
science
inspires
in
the
student
you
may
judge
me
unscrupulous
but
the
wheel
of
progress
is
at
least
as
unrelenting
it
was
not
however
without
much
searching
that
one
day
i
presented
myself
before
sir
burnham
coverly
at
park
if
i
had
had
any
scruples
prior
to
that
visit
they
were
instantly
dispelled
by
the
manner
of
my
reception
forgetful
of
the
service
which
as
he
believed
i
had
done
him
in
the
past
sir
burnham
allowed
all
the
prejudice
of
the
to
reveal
itself
in
his
first
greeting
because
i
am
an
eurasian
the
worst
traits
which
attach
to
such
a
parentage
and
of
which
i
am
only
too
painfully
conscious
revealed
themselves
in
me
my
heart
hardened
towards
this
man
whose
treatment
of
an
intellectual
superior
was
so
icily
so
offensively
condescending
knowing
that
i
had
it
in
my
power
to
deal
him
a
blow
from
which
he
might
never
recover
i
toyed
with
him
for
a
time
and
his
manner
growing
momentarily
more
objectionable
i
rejoiced
to
know
that
his
very
life
and
career
were
in
my
keeping
his
son
roger
coverly
at
that
time
a
boy
only
about
nine
years
old
as
the
prospective
heir
to
friar
park
was
cherished
as
an
only
child
is
always
cherished
in
these
circumstances
i
pictured
to
myself
the
meeting
of
brother
and
sister
yes
because
of
the
refined
and
deliberate
cruelty
which
sir
burnham
displayed
towards
myself
i
retaliated
with
a
poisoned
blade
having
led
the
conversation
in
the
direction
of
the
heir
i
threw
away
the
scabbard
of
pretense
i
launched
my
challenge
never
shall
i
forget
sir
burnham
change
of
countenance
he
tottered
a
stricken
man
with
a
sentence
of
ten
words
i
had
won
my
battle
upon
the
details
of
the
arrangement
which
presently
was
come
to
between
us
i
need
not
linger
for
this
statement
is
intended
not
as
a
defense
for
what
i
have
done
i
pay
the
price
but
as
a
résumé
of
this
crowning
inquiry
of
my
scientific
career
at
this
point
the
speaker
was
seized
with
an
alarming
spasm
of
pain
his
black
eyes
opened
widely
and
his
face
became
contorted
with
agony
i
sprang
to
his
assistance
for
villain
though
he
was
humanity
would
not
allow
of
any
man
witnessing
unmoved
such
paroxysms
in
a
fellow
creature
but
ere
i
could
reach
his
side
damar
greefe
clenching
his
teeth
and
clutching
at
the
so
that
his
knuckles
gleamed
in
the
like
white
marbles
turned
his
glance
upon
me
and
be
seated
sir
he
whispered
i
desire
you
to
be
seated
something
repellent
yet
something
powerful
there
was
in
word
and
glance
gatton
who
also
had
sprung
forward
hesitated
damar
greefe
raised
one
hand
from
the
and
waved
to
us
to
return
to
our
chairs
exchanging
wondering
glances
we
both
obeyed
thereupon
the
eurasian
doctor
whose
high
bony
forehead
was
dewed
with
a
deathly
perspiration
and
whose
had
assumed
an
indescribable
leaden
hue
drew
from
his
pocket
a
heavy
gold
watch
his
every
movement
intently
followed
by
the
alert
inspector
and
consulted
it
his
hand
shook
wildly
as
he
returned
the
timepiece
to
its
place
then
i
must
hasten
he
said
hoarsely
i
have
only
nineteen
minutes
gatton
looked
at
me
questioningly
but
i
could
only
shake
my
head
the
significance
of
the
eurasian
words
escaped
me
entirely
but
as
damar
greefe
begun
slowly
and
with
palpable
effort
to
speak
again
i
saw
a
queer
expression
stealing
over
the
face
of
the
watchful
gatton
chapter
xxvii
statement
of
damar
greefe
concluded
a
month
later
i
found
myself
installed
at
the
bell
house
a
property
belonging
to
the
friar
park
estate
and
in
the
commodious
apartments
of
this
establishment
i
had
ample
room
for
the
accommodation
of
my
library
and
my
priceless
specimens
nahémah
was
likewise
an
inmate
of
the
bell
house
but
recognizing
the
precarious
nature
of
my
tenure
i
had
taken
the
precaution
of
retaining
the
suburban
villa
to
which
i
have
already
referred
its
modest
rental
proving
no
tax
upon
my
greatly
increased
resources
blackmail
i
hear
you
exclaim
and
so
if
you
wish
you
may
construe
my
behavior
since
i
reply
science
first
science
last
to
have
been
deprived
of
the
means
to
pursue
my
experiments
at
this
time
would
have
been
i
believed
to
impoverish
the
world
for
not
even
science
could
reveal
to
me
that
my
life
work
was
destined
to
perish
amid
the
ashes
of
the
bell
house
my
studies
had
temporarily
led
me
into
a
and
apprehending
that
a
great
international
struggle
was
imminent
i
had
turned
my
investigations
in
a
new
direction
my
great
work
whose
publication
would
have
shattered
so
many
scientific
idols
was
complete
the
life
history
of
nahémah
had
crowned
my
inquiries
into
the
embryology
physiology
and
psychology
of
in
fact
the
presence
of
my
strange
protegée
promised
to
become
something
of
an
incubus
later
i
was
to
realize
that
she
was
an
means
of
renewing
those
funds
which
the
costly
character
of
my
new
studies
absorbed
at
rather
an
alarming
rate
perhaps
i
neglected
my
task
of
studying
the
mental
and
physical
development
of
nahémah
for
i
must
admit
that
lost
in
my
new
work
i
presently
awakened
to
the
fact
that
she
had
outgrown
the
control
which
i
had
formerly
exercised
over
her
there
were
unpleasant
episodes
for
example
in
spite
of
those
precautions
which
i
adopted
and
of
the
ceaseless
vigilance
of
cassim
the
existence
of
a
female
inmate
of
the
bell
house
was
soon
a
popular
scandal
throughout
upper
crossleys
for
this
i
cared
nothing
but
far
more
perturbing
was
nahémah
behavior
on
the
occasion
of
a
certain
visit
of
sir
burnham
legal
adviser
to
friar
park
in
some
way
she
secretly
gained
admission
to
the
house
the
episode
occurred
during
that
sothic
month
whose
annual
coming
i
had
learned
to
dread
sir
burnham
actually
saw
her
in
the
chapel
he
sent
a
messenger
to
the
and
i
finally
discovered
nahémah
in
hiding
and
insisted
upon
her
immediate
return
this
was
only
one
of
several
instances
of
her
perverse
behavior
which
truly
seemed
to
be
inspired
by
some
demon
bent
upon
the
destruction
of
both
of
us
her
mental
activity
was
extraordinary
and
unknown
to
me
she
had
followed
my
new
researches
with
that
intellectual
ardor
which
she
directly
inherited
from
the
coverlys
her
ferocious
jealousy
of
any
infringement
upon
those
family
rights
denied
her
by
her
father
had
also
developed
it
seemed
and
one
night
shortly
after
the
scene
to
which
i
have
referred
entering
my
study
she
placed
before
me
a
proposal
to
which
i
listened
with
absolute
horror
i
should
explain
that
sir
burnham
placing
the
repute
of
his
house
and
that
of
his
heir
above
all
other
considerations
with
one
possible
exception
the
necessity
for
concealing
the
appalling
truth
from
his
wife
had
consented
to
make
arrangements
for
the
support
of
nahémah
on
the
understanding
that
her
existence
was
to
remain
a
profound
secret
from
the
world
it
was
upon
this
understanding
that
i
leased
the
bell
house
and
although
in
certain
wild
indiscretions
i
had
recognized
in
nahémah
the
symptoms
of
revolt
against
such
a
monastic
existence
because
of
absorption
in
my
new
studies
i
had
not
realized
how
deep
was
her
resentment
of
this
enforced
anonymity
certainly
i
had
never
grasped
the
power
and
the
depth
of
her
hatred
of
her
brother
roger
coverly
now
on
this
fateful
night
in
one
of
the
outbursts
which
i
had
learned
to
dread
she
poured
out
her
loathing
and
detestation
of
her
brother
she
was
a
coverly
such
was
the
gist
of
her
plaint
and
the
doors
of
friar
park
were
closed
to
her
the
world
knew
nothing
of
her
existence
in
the
event
of
the
death
of
sir
burnham
then
roger
would
inherit
the
property
and
complete
disaster
would
be
our
lot
to
condense
the
purport
of
her
demand
it
was
this
that
i
should
test
the
efficacy
of
my
new
discovery
by
removing
this
objectionable
obstacle
from
her
path
of
my
subsequent
behavior
i
offer
no
defense
i
am
not
prepared
to
admit
that
i
was
forced
into
action
by
the
forceful
personality
of
my
protegée
in
fact
i
state
emphatically
that
a
chance
interview
with
the
heir
during
one
of
his
visits
to
friar
park
led
me
to
regard
the
matter
in
a
new
light
and
from
a
standpoint
almost
identical
with
that
of
nahémah
how
warning
was
conveyed
to
sir
burnham
i
know
not
unless
by
some
indiscretion
of
nahémah
but
instead
of
returning
to
the
public
school
from
which
he
had
come
to
friar
park
roger
coverly
was
sent
abroad
in
haste
accompanied
by
a
private
tutor
the
date
of
his
departure
corresponded
with
that
which
i
associate
with
the
beginning
of
my
downfall
nahémah
threatened
to
present
herself
to
her
mother
and
painfully
aware
that
such
a
course
which
nevertheless
i
recognized
her
to
be
quite
capable
of
adopting
would
spell
disaster
i
fell
in
with
her
wishes
two
months
later
we
were
established
nahémah
cassim
and
i
within
two
miles
of
the
new
residence
of
roger
coverly
and
his
tutor
in
basle
the
circumstances
attendant
upon
the
death
of
roger
coverly
have
hitherto
been
veiled
in
obscurity
and
although
sir
burnham
suspected
the
truth
in
the
first
place
he
had
no
evidence
and
in
the
second
place
because
of
the
existence
of
nahémah
i
knew
that
he
dared
not
attempt
to
prove
it
briefly
i
had
perfected
that
chinese
poison
called
in
the
northern
provinces
by
a
series
of
dangerous
experiments
i
had
convinced
myself
that
it
was
almost
identical
with
the
preparation
made
notorious
by
the
borgia
family
therefore
i
concluded
that
came
to
rome
from
the
east
possibly
via
palestine
inoculating
with
i
found
produced
death
in
two
hours
one
hour
and
minutes
leaving
no
trace
by
which
the
means
employed
could
be
discovered
by
the
subject
was
the
method
which
i
adopted
and
which
cæsar
borgia
had
adopted
before
me
so
that
no
chain
of
evidence
existed
all
that
was
necessary
was
for
a
scarf
a
collar
or
other
article
of
apparel
coming
in
direct
contact
with
the
skin
of
the
subject
to
be
placed
in
my
possession
a
glove
was
the
borgia
favorite
medium
it
was
painted
with
and
replaced
when
worn
an
intense
irritation
was
produced
and
a
cutaneous
eruption
which
if
scratched
even
very
lightly
resulted
in
a
puncture
of
the
skin
sufficient
to
allow
the
inimical
elements
of
the
poison
to
obtain
access
to
the
system
of
the
subject
i
do
not
propose
to
enter
into
details
but
so
it
was
that
roger
coverly
died
following
a
brief
sojourn
abroad
we
presently
returned
again
to
the
bell
house
this
gratification
of
her
bloodthirsty
desires
had
done
no
more
than
to
whet
the
feline
appetite
of
nahémah
and
she
forced
me
to
impose
new
and
almost
insupportable
conditions
upon
sir
burnham
with
the
result
as
is
known
that
from
being
a
very
wealthy
man
he
became
an
impoverished
one
i
even
held
a
mortgage
on
friar
park
on
behalf
of
nahémah
for
by
this
time
i
had
fully
recognized
the
fact
that
like
a
second
frankenstein
i
had
raised
up
a
monster
which
sooner
or
later
must
devour
me
her
indiscretions
threatened
daily
to
result
in
exposure
and
after
the
death
of
sir
burnham
which
occurred
a
short
time
later
these
increased
in
number
and
audacity
the
dying
baronet
had
impressed
upon
his
wife
the
necessity
of
following
my
guidance
in
all
things
undoubtedly
he
died
hoping
that
lady
coverly
might
live
out
her
days
in
ignorance
of
the
grim
secret
of
the
bell
house
this
dying
wish
of
his
was
gratified
the
loss
of
her
son
so
closely
followed
by
that
of
her
husband
prostrated
lady
coverly
in
a
mental
illness
from
which
she
never
recovered
although
i
exercised
all
my
skill
in
an
endeavor
to
restore
her
reason
she
spent
the
remainder
of
her
days
in
a
state
which
so
closely
resembled
death
that
to
this
present
moment
i
do
not
know
the
exact
hour
at
which
dissolution
took
place
in
the
man
hawkins
once
a
of
sir
burnham
i
found
an
instrument
ready
to
my
hand
i
closed
the
park
to
the
public
and
took
all
those
precautions
for
preserving
my
secret
which
prudence
dictated
this
at
the
cost
of
a
reputation
in
upper
crossleys
which
few
men
would
have
survived
but
which
troubled
me
not
at
all
since
it
left
me
undisturbed
to
those
studies
which
to
me
were
everything
the
death
of
sir
burnham
however
had
raised
a
new
danger
for
in
the
person
of
sir
marcus
coverly
the
heir
i
perceived
a
formidable
enemy
who
because
of
his
wealth
might
redeem
friar
park
and
because
of
the
fact
that
he
belonged
to
a
cadet
line
might
care
nothing
for
the
skeleton
in
sir
burnham
cupboard
i
have
said
that
science
is
callous
and
i
admit
that
it
needed
little
prompting
from
nahémah
to
urge
me
to
take
the
next
step
it
is
worthy
of
note
however
from
a
scientific
point
of
view
that
whilst
i
was
prompted
by
motives
of
expediency
she
was
actuated
solely
by
a
lust
to
destroy
everything
that
bore
the
name
of
coverly
my
experiments
for
some
time
past
had
been
directed
to
the
discovery
of
new
instruments
of
warfare
particularly
i
had
addressed
myself
to
the
preparation
of
a
which
should
possess
the
peculiar
properties
of
and
by
inhalation
affect
the
lung
tissues
thus
producing
instantaneous
results
in
this
i
had
succeeded
a
short
time
prior
to
sir
burnham
death
and
one
of
the
future
belligerents
had
approached
me
for
the
purpose
of
carrying
out
experiments
a
specially
designed
gun
was
brought
from
essen
and
installed
in
a
secluded
part
of
the
park
artillery
specialists
carried
out
a
number
of
tests
with
shells
of
various
patterns
but
because
i
bluntly
declined
to
divulge
the
formula
for
the
making
of
vapor
so
i
had
named
it
until
substantial
guarantees
were
given
negotiations
were
broken
off
i
retained
however
the
model
howitzer
as
well
as
a
number
of
special
light
shells
the
gun
was
one
of
extraordinary
accuracy
and
it
was
possible
given
suitable
weather
conditions
mechanically
to
train
it
upon
a
given
target
and
without
any
preliminary
searching
to
score
a
certain
hit
i
caused
the
piece
to
be
mounted
on
the
top
platform
of
the
tower
at
friar
park
and
having
completed
those
mathematical
calculations
with
the
result
of
which
addison
has
since
become
familiar
i
awaited
the
return
of
the
new
baronet
from
russia
shortly
after
his
arrival
i
invited
him
to
visit
upper
crossleys
he
refused
in
terms
which
provoked
an
outburst
on
nahémah
part
more
violent
than
i
had
ever
witnessed
but
on
his
final
return
to
england
she
made
it
her
business
closely
to
study
his
habits
and
movements
she
sought
feverishly
for
some
pregnable
point
of
attack
was
tried
three
times
and
three
times
failed
it
was
the
distorted
genius
of
nahémah
however
which
finally
dictated
a
new
line
of
action
she
learned
that
sir
marcus
was
paying
attention
to
isobel
merlin
the
fiancée
of
eric
coverly
who
in
the
event
of
sir
marcus
death
would
inherit
the
title
nahémah
propounded
to
me
a
theory
so
strange
and
so
novel
that
i
was
lost
in
admiration
of
that
brilliant
intellect
which
partly
inherited
from
her
forebears
was
stimulated
and
brightened
by
a
cunning
which
belonged
to
the
other
side
of
her
hybrid
personality
in
that
district
where
my
suburban
villa
was
situated
there
were
several
other
isolated
establishments
which
their
owners
experienced
some
difficulty
in
leasing
and
one
of
these
namely
the
red
house
particularly
suited
the
purpose
which
nahémah
had
in
view
the
extensive
resources
now
at
my
disposal
enabled
me
to
dispense
with
the
usual
formalities
which
beset
the
lessee
and
to
obtain
possession
of
the
red
house
without
even
appearing
in
person
the
deeper
to
complicate
the
issue
nahémah
carried
out
the
whole
of
the
negotiations
over
the
telephone
and
hers
was
the
voice
afterwards
rendered
notorious
by
the
press
which
issued
the
directions
culminating
in
the
death
of
marcus
coverly
i
recognize
that
the
inquiries
of
the
police
have
placed
in
your
possession
many
particulars
respecting
this
matter
so
that
i
will
not
repeat
them
here
but
will
content
myself
with
explaining
the
nature
of
the
device
employed
in
this
case
for
the
removal
of
the
subject
i
had
obtained
possession
of
an
old
telephone
and
had
adjusted
it
to
meet
my
requirements
in
a
recess
of
the
room
which
i
caused
sir
marcus
coverly
to
visit
at
the
red
house
i
placed
this
duplicate
telephone
the
false
cable
communicating
with
the
instrument
was
attached
to
a
plug
in
the
wall
above
but
communicated
with
a
gas
cylinder
in
the
adjoining
room
in
short
what
appeared
to
be
cable
was
in
reality
tubing
and
the
act
of
taking
the
receiver
from
the
hook
released
through
the
mouthpiece
a
sufficient
quantity
of
vapor
to
have
asphyxiated
a
dozen
men
in
order
to
insure
the
subject
receiving
the
benefit
of
the
whole
discharge
i
had
caused
a
very
heavy
curtain
to
be
draped
in
this
recess
which
thus
became
a
rough
following
the
first
discharge
the
subject
would
fall
to
the
floor
and
the
gas
being
a
heavy
one
he
would
there
receive
his
the
only
detail
which
occasioned
much
thought
was
that
of
the
bell
by
which
sir
marcus
should
be
summoned
to
this
prepared
telephone
for
it
formed
no
part
of
the
plan
for
myself
to
appear
anywhere
in
the
neighborhood
at
the
time
of
the
experiment
i
was
of
course
compelled
to
pay
a
secret
visit
to
the
red
house
for
the
purpose
of
installing
the
telephone
device
and
at
the
same
time
i
installed
the
bell
this
was
worked
from
a
small
storage
battery
and
i
arranged
that
by
the
opening
of
the
garage
door
the
bell
would
be
put
in
motion
and
by
the
closing
of
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
same
building
the
ringing
would
cease
a
simple
contrivance
screwed
to
both
doors
made
this
possible
but
i
know
not
by
whose
hand
the
ringing
would
have
been
accomplished
if
it
had
not
been
for
one
of
those
brilliant
suggestions
of
nahémah
which
hovered
between
the
domain
of
genius
and
that
of
fiendishness
she
proposed
that
she
should
ring
up
the
local
police
depôt
and
ask
the
constable
on
that
beat
to
lock
the
garage
thus
making
him
the
direct
instrument
for
the
removal
of
sir
marcus
i
knew
since
i
myself
had
been
a
resident
in
this
district
that
a
constable
patrolled
college
road
at
an
hour
roughly
corresponding
with
that
at
which
it
was
proposed
to
cause
sir
marcus
to
visit
the
red
house
and
because
all
strategy
is
based
upon
the
clock
a
brief
survey
of
the
facts
convinced
me
that
nahémah
plan
was
feasible
thus
it
was
bolton
whose
evidence
has
appeared
in
the
press
who
actually
killed
sir
marcus
coverly
i
come
now
to
the
dangerous
attitude
adopted
by
nahémah
immediately
after
the
event
we
had
had
a
case
of
suitable
dimensions
made
for
containing
the
body
and
had
had
it
delivered
at
the
red
house
garage
where
it
was
received
by
a
district
messenger
instructed
for
the
purpose
upon
me
devolved
the
task
of
carrying
the
body
from
the
to
the
garage
a
task
which
i
performed
shortly
after
the
departure
of
bolton
i
packed
the
body
removed
the
telephone
and
also
all
traces
of
the
the
same
carter
had
instructions
to
call
for
the
case
in
the
morning
and
the
garage
door
was
left
open
to
enable
him
to
collect
it
in
short
except
for
these
two
essential
visits
one
before
and
one
after
the
experiment
there
was
no
occasion
for
myself
or
nahémah
to
appear
in
the
neighborhood
of
the
red
house
but
that
spirit
of
impish
mischief
which
possessed
her
at
this
season
and
especially
at
night
together
with
an
almost
insane
joy
which
she
took
in
gloating
over
the
destruction
of
her
cousin
had
led
her
contrary
to
my
special
injunctions
to
haunt
the
vicinity
on
the
evening
of
the
experiment
thus
she
not
only
witnessed
the
arrival
of
the
doomed
man
but
also
saw
the
constable
perform
the
duty
imposed
upon
him
this
might
have
mattered
little
had
it
not
been
for
the
presence
of
addison
whom
an
unkind
fate
at
this
juncture
involved
in
the
matter
for
addison
nahémah
conceived
one
of
those
sudden
and
violent
infatuations
which
characterized
the
feline
element
of
her
complex
mentality
unknown
to
me
nahémah
followed
addison
to
his
home
in
the
neighborhood
and
indeed
was
actually
seen
by
him
i
believe
on
two
occasions
thus
far
all
might
yet
have
been
well
but
when
later
i
entered
the
red
house
to
carry
out
the
only
dangerous
part
of
the
scheme
to
my
consternation
nahémah
insisted
upon
accompanying
me
prompted
by
that
destructive
devil
which
sometimes
possessed
her
she
not
only
unknown
to
me
painted
a
figure
of
a
cat
upon
the
crate
but
also
she
placed
an
image
of
bâst
in
the
box
with
the
dead
man
the
premature
discovery
of
sir
marcus
owing
to
the
accident
at
the
docks
prevented
the
plan
being
carried
out
in
all
its
details
but
when
through
certain
rumors
which
began
to
creep
into
the
press
i
learned
of
the
presence
of
the
statuette
i
began
to
realize
the
dangerous
position
in
which
i
was
placed
and
the
handicap
of
such
an
accomplice
as
a
result
of
the
scene
which
ensued
nahémah
still
under
the
worst
influences
of
her
hybrid
disposition
openly
visited
addison
and
recovered
the
image
of
bâst
this
she
did
in
circumstances
which
hopelessly
compromised
both
of
us
since
they
revealed
in
a
hitherto
faultless
plan
the
presence
of
an
unsuspected
party
and
directed
the
police
inquiries
into
an
entirely
new
channel
i
thought
it
expedient
to
retire
immediately
to
the
bell
house
which
during
my
brief
absence
in
london
had
been
in
charge
of
cassim
all
approaches
to
friar
park
being
carefully
guarded
by
the
man
hawkins
at
this
point
i
may
touch
upon
a
previous
danger
which
had
been
met
and
overcome
provision
had
been
made
in
the
will
of
sir
burnham
for
the
retention
by
his
widow
of
friar
park
and
the
revenues
thereof
but
since
in
the
event
of
her
death
i
should
have
been
compelled
to
appear
in
the
character
of
the
mortgagee
it
was
contrary
to
our
interests
that
lady
coverly
should
die
whilst
any
heir
to
the
estate
remained
alive
nevertheless
despite
all
my
care
this
stricken
woman
had
died
six
months
prior
to
the
first
return
of
sir
marcus
from
russia
since
she
had
been
a
helpless
invalid
during
the
last
years
of
her
life
i
experienced
little
difficulty
in
concealing
the
fact
of
her
death
cassim
and
i
interred
her
by
night
in
the
family
mausoleum
where
she
lies
beside
her
husband
in
these
circumstances
judge
of
my
feelings
when
shortly
after
the
premature
discovery
termed
in
the
press
the
mystery
addison
one
day
presented
himself
at
the
bell
house
his
avowed
intention
of
calling
upon
lady
coverly
left
me
no
alternative
never
in
all
his
days
not
even
when
he
miraculously
escaped
the
vapor
at
the
abbey
inn
did
addison
stand
so
near
to
death
as
there
in
my
study
let
me
explain
the
situation
more
fully
the
fatal
sothic
month
which
i
have
learned
to
regard
with
horror
commenced
on
the
ultimo
and
does
not
terminate
for
another
five
days
nahémah
was
and
still
remains
possessed
you
will
understand
my
employment
of
the
term
on
the
night
preceding
this
visit
of
addison
i
had
traced
her
nocturnal
movements
by
the
howling
of
many
dogs
and
fearful
of
some
indiscretion
which
might
place
my
neck
in
a
noose
i
had
followed
her
i
found
her
in
a
narrow
footpath
which
leads
to
the
abbey
inn
despite
entreaties
threats
she
declined
to
give
any
explanation
of
her
behavior
but
finally
i
prevailed
upon
her
to
return
to
the
bell
house
the
appearance
of
addison
on
the
following
morning
opened
my
eyes
to
the
truth
with
the
scandal
still
attaching
to
the
names
of
edward
hines
and
another
man
called
i
believe
adams
a
subject
for
gossip
throughout
the
neighborhood
i
could
not
at
so
perilous
a
time
risk
the
consequences
of
a
third
intrigue
i
determined
that
addison
could
better
be
spared
by
the
community
than
nahémah
next
insanity
an
open
visit
to
the
abbey
inn
confirmed
my
opinion
thereupon
i
committed
my
first
mistake
cassim
the
nubian
mute
who
had
been
in
my
service
for
many
years
was
formerly
attached
to
a
great
household
in
stambûl
i
shall
probably
be
understood
i
instructed
him
and
addison
very
cleverly
playing
upon
his
superstitious
nature
cassim
failed
my
time
grows
short
i
will
touch
upon
my
second
folly
of
that
night
long
before
the
possibility
of
firing
a
projectile
from
the
tower
of
friar
park
into
the
upper
front
of
the
abbey
inn
had
presented
itself
to
me
in
the
light
of
a
feasible
experiment
unaware
that
inspector
gatton
was
watching
me
unaware
that
in
my
absence
he
had
actually
detected
the
presence
of
the
gun
upon
the
tower
i
played
my
last
card
and
lost
cassim
it
was
who
detected
the
fact
that
police
were
watching
the
bell
house
cassim
had
failed
me
once
i
instructed
him
a
second
time
i
near
the
end
of
my
statement
destruction
of
all
my
effects
of
all
evidence
of
my
work
and
crowning
tragedy
of
every
trace
of
a
research
was
unavoidable
knowing
that
every
railway
station
and
port
would
be
watched
and
that
my
marked
personality
could
not
hope
to
escape
the
vigilance
of
the
authorities
i
determined
to
make
a
bid
for
freedom
by
seeking
the
shelter
of
my
villa
in
london
cassim
systematically
fired
the
bell
house
and
perished
in
the
flames
under
cover
of
the
confusion
which
the
conflagration
occasioned
nahémah
and
i
succeeded
in
making
our
retirement
by
the
gate
opening
on
the
hainingham
road
but
in
my
attempts
upon
the
life
of
addison
i
had
not
counted
with
nahémah
i
had
raised
up
a
monster
that
monster
has
destroyed
me
chapter
xxviii
the
claws
of
the
cat
the
hoarse
voice
ceased
neither
gatton
nor
i
moved
or
spoke
then
i
have
three
minutes
or
less
whispered
damar
greefe
question
me
i
am
at
your
service
where
is
your
villa
asked
gatton
suddenly
it
is
called
the
laurels
the
laurels
i
cried
incredulously
it
is
called
so
whispered
the
eurasian
it
is
the
last
house
but
one
in
college
road
from
there
i
conducted
my
last
experiment
with
vapor
which
resulted
not
in
the
death
of
addison
but
in
that
of
eric
coverly
gatton
sprang
to
his
feet
come
along
mr
addison
he
cried
but
the
laurels
is
empty
came
ever
more
faintly
in
her
sothic
fury
nahémah
fled
the
bloodlust
is
upon
her
i
warn
you
she
is
more
dangerous
than
any
rabid
dog
tuberculosis
will
end
her
life
before
the
snows
come
but
there
is
time
for
her

ah
god
mercy
he
writhed
he
was
contorted
foam
appeared
upon
his
lips
he
moaned
touched
me
with
a
poisoned
needle
ago
he
rose
to
his
full
height
uttered
a
stifled
scream
and
crashed
down
upon
the
floor
dead
in
a
species
of
consternation
gatton
and
i
stood
looking
at
one
another
standing
rigidly
like
men
of
stone
one
on
either
side
of
that
long
thin
body
stretched
upon
my
study
floor
the
hawk
face
in
profile
was
startlingly
like
that
of
anubis
as
it
lay
against
the
red
carpet
neither
of
us
i
think
was
capable
of
grasping
the
fact
that
the
inquiry
was
all
but
ended
and
that
the
mysteries
which
had
seemed
so
dark
and
insoluble
were
cleared
up
and
the
inner
workings
of
this
strange
conspiracy
laid
bare
before
us
one
thought
i
believe
was
uppermost
in
both
our
minds
that
the
man
who
now
lay
dead
upon
the
floor
a
victim
of
one
of
his
own
devilish
inventions
was
no
more
than
a
brilliant
madman
if
his
great
work
on
the
of
abyssinia
and
that
greater
one
dealing
with
what
he
called
the
had
ever
had
existence
outside
his
own
strange
imagination
no
one
was
ever
likely
to
know
but
that
damar
greefe
was
a
genius
whom
much
learning
had
made
mad
neither
of
us
doubted
the
whole
thing
seemed
the
wildest
phantasy
and
for
a
time
in
doubting
the
reality
of
the
eurasian
work
i
found
myself
doubting
the
evidence
of
my
own
senses
and
seriously
wondering
if
this
possessed
whose
green
eyes
had
moved
like
satanic
lanterns
throughout
the
whole
phantasmagoria
had
any
more
palpable
existence
than
the
other
strange
things
spoken
of
by
the
unscrupulous
scientist
that
gatton
thoughts
had
been
running
parallel
with
my
own
was
presently
made
manifest
for
without
a
moment
delay
addison
he
said
speaking
like
a
man
newly
awakened
from
slumber
we
must
proceed
to
the
laurels
and
test
the
truth
of
what
we
have
heard
he
crossed
to
the
door
threw
it
open
and
sergeant
he
cried
come
in
the
prisoner
is
dead
as
the
sergeant
and
the
constable
who
were
waiting
came
into
the
study
and
stood
looking
in
stupefaction
at
the
body
stretched
on
the
floor
i
heard
the
telephone
bell
ring
i
started
nervously
that
sound
awakened
ghastly
memories
and
i
thought
of
the
man
who
only
a
few
hours
before
had
met
his
death
in
the
room
where
now
the
bell
was
ringing
its
summons
i
doubted
if
i
could
ever
spend
another
night
beneath
that
roof
for
here
damar
greefe
the
and
one
of
his
victims
both
had
met
their
ends
i
heard
the
voice
of
coates
speaking
in
the
adjoining
room
and
presently
as
gatton
went
to
the
door
miss
merlin
wishes
to
speak
to
you
sir
said
coates
i
ran
eagerly
to
the
and
hello
i
cried
is
that
you
isobel
yes
came
her
reply
and
i
noted
the
agitation
in
her
voice
i
am
more
dreadfully
frightened
than
i
have
ever
been
in
my
life
if
only
you
were
here
is
it
possible
for
you
to
come
at
once
what
has
alarmed
you
i
asked
anxiously
i
ca
explain
she
replied
it
is
a
dreadful
sense
of
foreboding
and
all
the
dogs
in
the
neighborhood
seem
to
have
gone
mad
dogs
i
cried
a
numbing
fear
creeping
over
me
you
mean
that
they
are
howling
howling
she
answered
i
have
never
heard
such
a
pandemonium
at
any
time
in
my
present
state
of
nerves
jack
i
did
the
wrong
thing
in
coming
to
this
funny
lonely
little
house
i
feel
deserted
and
hopeless
and
for
some
reason
in
terrible
danger
are
you
then
i
asked
in
ever
growing
anxiety
to
my
utter
consternation
yes
she
replied
aunt
alison
was
called
away
half
an
hour
ago
to
identify
some
one
at
a
hospital
who
had
asked
for
her
what
an
accident
i
suppose
so
but
the
servants
cook
left
this
morning
you
remember
aunt
told
you
she
was
leaving
there
is
the
girl
mary
aunt
for
her
to
join
her
at
the
hospital
what
i
do
understand
you
say
was
it
wentworth
who
no
i
think
not
one
of
the
nurses
mary
said
but
at
any
rate
she
has
gone
jack
and
i
frightened
to
death
there
something
else
she
added
yes
i
said
eagerly
she
laughed
in
a
way
that
sounded
almost
hysterical
since
mary
went
i
have
thought
once
or
twice
that
i
have
seen
some
one
or
something
creeping
around
outside
the
house
in
the
shadows
amongst
the
trees
and
just
a
while
ago
something
happened
which
really
prompted
me
to
you
what
was
it
i
heard
a
sort
of
scratching
at
an
upper
window
it
was
just
like
yes
yes
like
a
great
trying
to
gain
admittance
see
that
all
the
doors
and
windows
are
fastened
i
cried
whatever
happens
or
whoever
knocks
do
open
to
any
one
you
understand
we
will
be
with
you
in
less
than
half
an
hour
still
in
that
frightened
voice
for
heaven
sake
she
begged
do
be
long
jack
i
became
aware
of
a
singular
rasping
sound
on
the
wires
which
rendered
isobel
words
almost
unintelligible
then
jack
i
heard
in
a
faint
whisper
there
is
a
strange
noise
just
outside
the
room
silence
came
but
vaguely
above
that
rasping
sound
i
had
detected
the
words
cutting
telephone
wires
i
replaced
the
receiver
my
hand
was
shaking
wildly
gatton
i
said
do
you
understand
has
turned
its
attention
to
miss
merlin
then
raising
my
voice
coates
i
cried
coates
run
for
the
car
hurry
man
some
one
life
depends
on
your
speed
inspector
gatton
grabbed
the
telephone
directory
i
will
instruct
the
local
police
he
muttered
give
me
the
exact
address
addison
and
go
and
see
the
cab
that
outside
if
it
a
good
one
we
take
it
instead
of
waiting
out
i
dashed
spurred
by
a
sickly
terror
crying
address
as
i
ran
and
of
the
ensuing
five
minutes
i
retain
nothing
but
chaotic
memories
the
bewildered
cabman
the
police
bending
over
the
gaunt
form
on
my
study
floor
gatton
voice
shouting
orders
then
we
had
jumped
into
the
cab
and
enjoining
the
man
to
drive
like
fury
were
speeding
off
through
the
busy
london
streets
leaving
the
quietude
of
one
suburb
for
the
maelstrom
of
central
london
we
presently
emerged
into
an
equally
quiet
backwater
upon
the
northerly
outskirts
it
was
a
nightmare
journey
but
when
at
last
we
approached
the
house
for
which
we
were
bound
my
apprehension
and
excitement
grew
even
keener
it
was
infinitely
more
isolated
and
lonely
than
i
had
ever
realized
behind
its
high
brick
walls
of
the
local
police
there
was
no
sign
and
without
hesitation
we
ran
in
at
the
open
gate
and
up
the
path
towards
the
porch
every
window
in
the
house
was
brightly
illuminated
testifying
to
the
greatness
of
the
occupant
fear
gaining
the
porch
we
stopped
as
if
prompted
by
some
mutual
thought
and
listened
there
was
the
remote
murmuring
of
busy
london
but
here
surrounding
us
was
a
stillness
as
great
as
that
which
prevailed
in
my
own
neighborhood
and
as
we
stood
there
keenly
alert
distinctly
we
both
heard
the
howling
of
dogs
you
hear
it
rapped
gatton
i
do
i
replied
grasping
the
i
executed
a
vigorous
peal
upon
the
bell
there
was
a
light
in
the
hallway
but
my
ringing
elicited
no
response
until
my
god
look
cried
gatton
he
pulled
me
backward
out
of
the
porch
looking
upward
to
the
window
of
a
room
on
the
first
floor
a
silhouette
appeared
there
undoubtedly
that
of
isobel
she
seemed
to
be
endeavoring
to
pull
the
curtain
aside
when
the
shadow
of
a
long
arm
reached
out
to
her
and
she
was
plucked
irresistibly
back
the
sound
of
a
muffled
scream
reached
my
ears
and
great
heavens
has
got
in
whispered
gatton
he
raised
his
hand
and
the
shrill
note
of
a
police
whistle
split
the
silence
the
closed
door
was
obviously
too
strong
to
be
forced
without
the
aid
of
implements
for
the
purpose
and
we
began
to
run
around
the
house
looking
for
some
means
of
entrance
suddenly
there
the
way
said
gatton
and
pointed
up
to
where
the
branches
of
an
old
elm
tree
stretched
out
before
a
window
the
glass
of
the
window
was
entirely
shattered
except
for
some
few
points
which
glittered
like
daggers
around
the
edges
of
the
frame
can
you
do
it
in
the
circumstances
yes
i
said
without
more
ado
i
began
to
climb
the
elm
stimulated
by
memories
of
how
i
had
entered
friar
park
it
afforded
little
foothold
for
the
first
six
feet
and
proved
an
even
tougher
job
than
i
had
anticipated
but
at
last
i
reached
a
projecting
limb
the
bulk
of
which
had
been
sawn
off
gatton
agility
was
not
so
great
as
mine
but
at
the
moment
that
i
half
staggered
and
half
fell
into
the
room
i
heard
him
swinging
himself
onto
the
limb
behind
me
so
that
as
i
leaped
to
the
open
door
he
came
tumbling
in
through
the
window
and
the
pair
of
us
raced
side
by
side
along
the
corridor
towards
an
apartment
facing
front
from
which
horrifying
cries
and
sounds
of
conflict
now
arose
gaining
the
closed
door
of
this
room
i
literally
hurled
myself
upon
it
it
crashed
open
and
i
beheld
a
dreadful
spectacle
isobel
lay
forced
back
upon
a
settee
which
occupied
the
window
recess
and
bending
over
her
having
her
back
turned
towards
me
was
a
tall
lithe
woman
who
so
far
as
i
could
see
was
clutching
isobel
throat
and
forcing
her
further
backward
backward
upon
the
cushions
strewn
upon
the
settee
but
instant
upon
the
door
opening
this
horrible
scene
changed
with
never
a
backward
glance
so
that
neither
gatton
nor
i
had
even
a
momentary
glimpse
of
her
face
the
woman
sprang
to
the
window
opened
it
in
a
moment
and
to
my
dismay
and
astonishment
sprang
out
into
the
darkness
my
first
thought
was
for
isobel
but
gatton
leaped
across
the
room
and
craned
out
peering
on
to
the
path
below
indeed
even
as
i
dropped
on
my
knees
beside
the
swooning
girl
i
found
myself
listening
for
the
thud
of
the
falling
body
upon
the
gravel
path
but
no
sound
reached
me
that
uncanny
creature
must
have
alighted
truly
in
the
manner
of
a
cat
through
the
stillness
of
the
house
rang
the
flat
note
of
a
from
some
distant
spot
i
heard
a
faint
reply
for
long
i
failed
to
persuade
myself
that
isobel
had
not
sustained
some
ghastly
injury
from
the
attack
of
the
memories
uprose
starkly
before
me
of
that
and
the
other
dreadful
of
the
mad
eurasian
doctor
not
even
the
assurances
of
the
local
medical
man
who
had
been
summoned
in
haste
could
convince
me
for
i
recognized
how
petty
was
his
knowledge
in
comparison
with
that
of
damar
greefe
but
although
i
trembled
to
think
what
her
fate
might
have
been
if
we
had
arrived
a
few
minutes
later
the
fact
remained
and
i
returned
thanks
to
heaven
that
she
had
escaped
serious
physical
injury
at
the
hands
of
her
assailant
but
alas
to
this
very
hour
she
sometimes
awakes
shrieking
in
the
night
and
her
terrified
cry
is
always
the
same
the
green
eyes
of
bâst
the
of
bâst
chapter
xxix
an
afterword
i
wish
it
lay
in
my
power
to
satisfy
the
curiosity
in
all
quarters
expressed
respecting
the
identity
of
nahémah
the
or
who
figured
in
damar
greefe
statement
but
it
is
my
duty
as
chronicler
of
the
strange
and
awful
occurrences
which
at
this
period
disturbed
the
even
tenor
of
my
existence
to
state
that
from
the
moment
in
which
she
leaped
from
the
window
of
wentworth
house
to
the
path
below
neither
i
nor
any
other
witness
who
ever
came
forward
her
at
the
end
of
a
quest
which
exercised
the
intricate
machinery
of
new
scotland
yard
throughout
the
length
and
breadth
of
the
land
inspector
gatton
was
compelled
to
admit
himself
defeated
in
this
particular
and
his
explanation
of
the
failure
to
apprehend
the
central
figure
of
the
tragedies
which
had
exterminated
the
house
of
coverly
was
a
curious
one
you
know
addison
he
said
to
me
one
evening
the
more
i
think
of
this
nahémah
the
more
i
wonder
if
such
a
person
ever
really
existed
what
do
you
mean
gatton
i
asked
well
he
replied
i
mean
that
although
you
and
i
and
others
are
prepared
to
testify
to
the
existence
of
a
woman
in
the
case
what
do
we
really
know
about
her
leaving
damar
greefe
statement
out
of
the
question
except
that
she
possessed
very
remarkable
eyes
and
very
remarkable
agility
i
interrupted
yes
i
grant
you
that
he
said
her
agility
was
certainly
phenomenal
but
still
as
i
was
saying
except
for
this
definite
information
we
have
no
outside
the
statement
of
damar
greefe
that
such
a
person
as
nahémah
ever
existed
or
at
any
rate
that
there
ever
was
a
creature
possessing
the
attributes
which
he
ascribed
to
her
the
laurels
is
an
ordinary
suburban
house
which
has
been
leased
for
a
number
of
years
by
a
and
miss
da
costa
damar
greefe
no
doubt
and
a
female
companion
but
of
his
work
and
so
forth
there
not
a
trace
there
are
a
lot
of
egyptian
antiquities
i
admit
but
not
a
scrap
of
evidence
and
the
rooms
evidently
used
by
the
female
inmate
of
the
household
are
those
of
an
ordinary
cultured
englishwoman
but
good
heavens
gatton
i
cried
whatever
explanation
can
you
offer
of
a
series
of
crimes
which
were
palpably
directed
against
the
members
of
the
coverly
family
i
do
say
continued
gatton
that
there
was
a
sort
of
feud
or
vendetta
at
the
bottom
of
the
business
i
merely
mention
that
we
have
no
to
show
that
the
person
responsible
for
it
was
any
other
than
this
eurasian
doctor
but
what
could
have
been
his
object
i
could
suggest
several
but
my
point
at
the
moment
is
this
although
i
am
prepared
to
grant
that
he
had
a
woman
associate
of
some
kind
i
ca
see
that
there
is
any
evidence
to
prove
that
she
was
otherwise
than
an
ordinary
human
being
except
that
i
am
disposed
to
think
she
was
demented
you
are
probably
right
there
gatton
i
agreed
and
damar
greefe
was
by
no
means
normal
in
fact
i
think
he
was
a
dangerous
and
very
brilliant
maniac
at
any
rate
added
gatton
no
trace
of
this
nahémah
has
been
found
which
at
the
least
is
very
significant
significant
if
you
like
i
replied
but
for
my
own
part
i
have
no
ambition
whatever
to
see
again
those
dreadful
green
eyes
i
never
did
see
them
said
gatton
musingly
therefore
i
ca
speak
upon
the
matter
but
when
we
got
damar
greefe
i
think
we
had
the
head
of
the
conspiracy
how
much
of
his
is
true
and
how
much
the
product
of
a
diseased
mind
is
something
we
are
never
likely
to
know
nor
am
i
curious
to
know
it
i
assured
him
i
only
desire
to
forget
the
tragedies
associated
with
the
green
eyes
of
bâst
and
to
leave
the
darkness
of
the
past
behind
and
said
gatton
with
a
smile
less
grim
than
usual
you
have
my
best
wishes
for
the
future
the
end
greatest
pleasure
in
life
is
that
of
reading
why
not
then
own
the
books
of
great
novelists
when
the
price
is
so
all
the
amusements
which
can
possibly
be
imagined
for
a
man
after
his
daily
toil
or
in
its
intervals
there
is
nothing
like
reading
an
entertaining
book
it
calls
for
no
bodily
exertion
it
transports
him
into
a
livelier
and
gayer
and
more
diversified
and
interesting
scene
and
while
he
enjoys
himself
there
he
may
forget
the
evils
of
the
present
moment
nay
it
accompanies
him
to
his
next
day
work
and
gives
him
something
to
think
of
besides
the
mere
mechanical
drudgery
of
his
occupation
something
he
can
enjoy
while
absent
and
look
forward
with
pleasure
