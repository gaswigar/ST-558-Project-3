timaeus
by
plato
translated
by
benjamin
jowett
introduction
and
analysis
of
all
the
writings
of
plato
the
timaeus
is
the
most
obscure
and
repulsive
to
the
modern
reader
and
has
nevertheless
had
the
greatest
influence
over
the
ancient
and
mediaeval
world
the
obscurity
arises
in
the
infancy
of
physical
science
out
of
the
confusion
of
theological
mathematical
and
physiological
notions
out
of
the
desire
to
conceive
the
whole
of
nature
without
any
adequate
knowledge
of
the
parts
and
from
a
greater
perception
of
similarities
which
lie
on
the
surface
than
of
differences
which
are
hidden
from
view
to
bring
sense
under
the
control
of
reason
to
find
some
way
through
the
mist
or
labyrinth
of
appearances
either
the
highway
of
mathematics
or
more
devious
paths
suggested
by
the
analogy
of
man
with
the
world
and
of
the
world
with
man
to
see
that
all
things
have
a
cause
and
are
tending
towards
an
end
this
is
the
spirit
of
the
ancient
physical
philosopher
he
has
no
notion
of
trying
an
experiment
and
is
hardly
capable
of
observing
the
curiosities
of
nature
which
are
out
at
his
feet
or
of
interpreting
even
the
most
obvious
of
them
he
is
driven
back
from
the
nearer
to
the
more
distant
from
particulars
to
generalities
from
the
earth
to
the
stars
he
lifts
up
his
eyes
to
the
heavens
and
seeks
to
guide
by
their
motions
his
erring
footsteps
but
we
neither
appreciate
the
conditions
of
knowledge
to
which
he
was
subjected
nor
have
the
ideas
which
fastened
upon
his
imagination
the
same
hold
upon
us
for
he
is
hanging
between
matter
and
mind
he
is
under
the
dominion
at
the
same
time
both
of
sense
and
of
abstractions
his
impressions
are
taken
almost
at
random
from
the
outside
of
nature
he
sees
the
light
but
not
the
objects
which
are
revealed
by
the
light
and
he
brings
into
juxtaposition
things
which
to
us
appear
wide
as
the
poles
asunder
because
he
finds
nothing
between
them
he
passes
abruptly
from
persons
to
ideas
and
numbers
and
from
ideas
and
numbers
to
persons
from
the
heavens
to
man
from
astronomy
to
physiology
he
confuses
or
rather
does
not
distinguish
subject
and
object
first
and
final
causes
and
is
dreaming
of
geometrical
figures
lost
in
a
flux
of
sense
he
contrasts
the
perfect
movements
of
the
heavenly
bodies
with
the
imperfect
representation
of
them
and
he
does
not
always
require
strict
accuracy
even
in
applications
of
number
and
figure
his
mind
lingers
around
the
forms
of
mythology
which
he
uses
as
symbols
or
translates
into
figures
of
speech
he
has
no
implements
of
observation
such
as
the
telescope
or
microscope
the
great
science
of
chemistry
is
a
blank
to
him
it
is
only
by
an
effort
that
the
modern
thinker
can
breathe
the
atmosphere
of
the
ancient
philosopher
or
understand
how
under
such
unequal
conditions
he
seems
in
many
instances
by
a
sort
of
inspiration
to
have
anticipated
the
truth
the
influence
with
the
timaeus
has
exercised
upon
posterity
is
due
partly
to
a
misunderstanding
in
the
supposed
depths
of
this
dialogue
the
found
hidden
meanings
and
connections
with
the
jewish
and
christian
scriptures
and
out
of
them
they
elicited
doctrines
quite
at
variance
with
the
spirit
of
plato
believing
that
he
was
inspired
by
the
holy
ghost
or
had
received
his
wisdom
from
moses
they
seemed
to
find
in
his
writings
the
christian
trinity
the
word
the
church
the
creation
of
the
world
in
a
jewish
sense
as
they
really
found
the
personality
of
god
or
of
mind
and
the
immortality
of
the
soul
all
religions
and
philosophies
met
and
mingled
in
the
schools
of
alexandria
and
the
had
a
method
of
interpretation
which
could
elicit
any
meaning
out
of
any
words
they
were
really
incapable
of
distinguishing
between
the
opinions
of
one
philosopher
and
another
between
aristotle
and
plato
or
between
the
serious
thoughts
of
plato
and
his
passing
fancies
they
were
absorbed
in
his
theology
and
were
under
the
dominion
of
his
name
while
that
which
was
truly
great
and
truly
characteristic
in
him
his
effort
to
realize
and
connect
abstractions
was
not
understood
by
them
at
all
yet
the
genius
of
plato
and
greek
philosophy
reacted
upon
the
east
and
a
greek
element
of
thought
and
language
overlaid
and
partly
reduced
to
order
the
chaos
of
orientalism
and
kindred
spirits
like
augustine
even
though
they
were
acquainted
with
his
writings
only
through
the
medium
of
a
latin
translation
were
profoundly
affected
by
them
seeming
to
find
and
his
word
everywhere
insinuated
in
them
august
confess
there
is
no
danger
of
the
modern
commentators
on
the
timaeus
falling
into
the
absurdities
of
the
in
the
present
day
we
are
well
aware
that
an
ancient
philosopher
is
to
be
interpreted
from
himself
and
by
the
contemporary
history
of
thought
we
know
that
mysticism
is
not
criticism
the
fancies
of
the
are
only
interesting
to
us
because
they
exhibit
a
phase
of
the
human
mind
which
prevailed
widely
in
the
first
centuries
of
the
christian
era
and
is
not
wholly
extinct
in
our
own
day
but
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
interpretation
of
plato
and
in
spirit
they
are
opposed
to
him
they
are
the
feeble
expression
of
an
age
which
has
lost
the
power
not
only
of
creating
great
works
but
of
understanding
them
they
are
the
spurious
birth
of
a
marriage
between
philosophy
and
tradition
between
hellas
and
the
east
greek
whereas
the
mysticism
of
plato
is
purely
greek
arising
out
of
his
imperfect
knowledge
and
high
aspirations
and
is
the
growth
of
an
age
in
which
philosophy
is
not
wholly
separated
from
poetry
and
mythology
a
greater
danger
with
modern
interpreters
of
plato
is
the
tendency
to
regard
the
timaeus
as
the
centre
of
his
system
we
do
not
know
how
plato
would
have
arranged
his
own
dialogues
or
whether
the
thought
of
arranging
any
of
them
besides
the
two
which
he
has
expressly
connected
was
ever
present
to
his
mind
but
if
he
had
arranged
them
there
are
many
indications
that
this
is
not
the
place
which
he
would
have
assigned
to
the
timaeus
we
observe
first
of
all
that
the
dialogue
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
a
pythagorean
philosopher
and
not
of
socrates
and
this
is
required
by
dramatic
propriety
for
the
investigation
of
nature
was
expressly
renounced
by
socrates
in
the
phaedo
nor
does
plato
himself
attribute
any
importance
to
his
guesses
at
science
he
is
not
at
all
absorbed
by
them
as
he
is
by
the
idea
of
good
he
is
modest
and
hesitating
and
confesses
that
his
words
partake
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
subject
the
dialogue
is
primarily
concerned
with
the
animal
creation
including
under
this
term
the
heavenly
bodies
and
with
man
only
as
one
among
the
animals
but
we
can
hardly
suppose
that
plato
would
have
preferred
the
study
of
nature
to
man
or
that
he
would
have
deemed
the
formation
of
the
world
and
the
human
frame
to
have
the
same
interest
which
he
ascribes
to
the
mystery
of
being
and
or
to
the
great
political
problems
which
he
discusses
in
the
republic
and
the
laws
there
are
no
speculations
on
physics
in
the
other
dialogues
of
plato
and
he
himself
regards
the
consideration
of
them
as
a
rational
pastime
only
he
is
beginning
to
feel
the
need
of
further
divisions
of
knowledge
and
is
becoming
aware
that
besides
dialectic
mathematics
and
the
arts
there
is
another
field
which
has
been
hitherto
unexplored
by
him
but
he
has
not
as
yet
defined
this
intermediate
territory
which
lies
somewhere
between
medicine
and
mathematics
and
he
would
have
felt
that
there
was
as
great
an
impiety
in
ranking
theories
of
physics
first
in
the
order
of
knowledge
as
in
placing
the
body
before
the
soul
it
is
true
however
that
the
timaeus
is
by
no
means
confined
to
speculations
on
physics
the
deeper
foundations
of
the
platonic
philosophy
such
as
the
nature
of
god
the
distinction
of
the
sensible
and
intellectual
the
great
original
conceptions
of
time
and
space
also
appear
in
it
they
are
found
principally
in
the
first
half
of
the
dialogue
the
construction
of
the
heavens
is
for
the
most
part
ideal
the
cyclic
year
serves
as
the
connection
between
the
world
of
absolute
being
and
of
generation
just
as
the
number
of
population
in
the
republic
is
the
expression
or
symbol
of
the
transition
from
the
ideal
to
the
actual
state
in
some
passages
we
are
uncertain
whether
we
are
reading
a
description
of
astronomical
facts
or
contemplating
processes
of
the
human
mind
or
of
that
divine
mind
phil
which
in
plato
is
hardly
separable
from
it
the
characteristics
of
man
are
transferred
to
the
as
for
example
when
intelligence
and
knowledge
are
said
to
be
perfected
by
the
circle
of
the
same
and
true
opinion
by
the
circle
of
the
other
and
conversely
the
motions
of
the
reappear
in
man
its
amorphous
state
continues
in
the
child
and
in
both
disorder
and
chaos
are
gradually
succeeded
by
stability
and
order
it
is
not
however
to
passages
like
these
that
plato
is
referring
when
he
speaks
of
the
uncertainty
of
his
subject
but
rather
to
the
composition
of
bodies
to
the
relations
of
colours
the
nature
of
diseases
and
the
like
about
which
he
truly
feels
the
lamentable
ignorance
prevailing
in
his
own
age
we
are
led
by
plato
himself
to
regard
the
timaeus
not
as
the
centre
or
inmost
shrine
of
the
edifice
but
as
a
detached
building
in
a
different
style
framed
not
after
the
socratic
but
after
some
pythagorean
model
as
in
the
cratylus
and
parmenides
we
are
uncertain
whether
plato
is
expressing
his
own
opinions
or
appropriating
and
perhaps
improving
the
philosophical
speculations
of
others
in
all
three
dialogues
he
is
exerting
his
dramatic
and
imitative
power
in
the
cratylus
mingling
a
satirical
and
humorous
purpose
with
true
principles
of
language
in
the
parmenides
overthrowing
megarianism
by
a
sort
of
which
discovers
contradictions
in
the
one
as
great
as
those
which
have
been
previously
shown
to
exist
in
the
ideas
there
is
a
similar
uncertainty
about
the
timaeus
in
the
first
part
he
scales
the
heights
of
transcendentalism
in
the
latter
part
he
treats
in
a
bald
and
superficial
manner
of
the
functions
and
diseases
of
the
human
frame
he
uses
the
thoughts
and
almost
the
words
of
parmenides
when
he
discourses
of
being
and
of
essence
adopting
from
old
religion
into
philosophy
the
conception
of
god
and
from
the
megarians
the
idea
of
good
he
agrees
with
empedocles
and
the
atomists
in
attributing
the
greater
differences
of
kinds
to
the
figures
of
the
elements
and
their
movements
into
and
out
of
one
another
with
heracleitus
he
acknowledges
the
perpetual
flux
like
anaxagoras
he
asserts
the
predominance
of
mind
although
admitting
an
element
of
necessity
which
reason
is
incapable
of
subduing
like
the
pythagoreans
he
supposes
the
mystery
of
the
world
to
be
contained
in
number
many
if
not
all
the
elements
of
the
philosophy
are
included
in
the
timaeus
it
is
a
composite
or
eclectic
work
of
imagination
in
which
plato
without
naming
them
gathers
up
into
a
kind
of
system
the
various
elements
of
philosophy
which
preceded
him
if
we
allow
for
the
difference
of
subject
and
for
some
growth
in
plato
own
mind
the
discrepancy
between
the
timaeus
and
the
other
dialogues
will
not
appear
to
be
great
it
is
probable
that
the
relation
of
the
ideas
to
god
or
of
god
to
the
world
was
differently
conceived
by
him
at
different
times
of
his
life
in
all
his
later
dialogues
we
observe
a
tendency
in
him
to
personify
mind
or
god
and
he
therefore
naturally
inclines
to
view
creation
as
the
work
of
design
the
creator
is
like
a
human
artist
who
frames
in
his
mind
a
plan
which
he
executes
by
the
help
of
his
servants
thus
the
language
of
philosophy
which
speaks
of
first
and
second
causes
is
crossed
by
another
sort
of
phraseology
made
the
world
because
he
was
good
and
the
demons
ministered
to
him
the
timaeus
is
cast
in
a
more
theological
and
less
philosophical
mould
than
the
other
dialogues
but
the
same
general
spirit
is
apparent
there
is
the
same
dualism
or
opposition
between
the
ideal
and
actual
the
soul
is
prior
to
the
body
the
intelligible
and
unseen
to
the
visible
and
corporeal
there
is
the
same
distinction
between
knowledge
and
opinion
which
occurs
in
the
theaetetus
and
republic
the
same
enmity
to
the
poets
the
same
combination
of
music
and
gymnastics
the
doctrine
of
transmigration
is
still
held
by
him
as
in
the
phaedrus
and
republic
and
the
soul
has
a
view
of
the
heavens
in
a
prior
state
of
being
the
ideas
also
remain
but
they
have
become
types
in
nature
forms
of
men
animals
birds
fishes
and
the
attribution
of
evil
to
physical
causes
accords
with
the
doctrine
which
he
maintains
in
the
laws
respecting
the
involuntariness
of
vice
the
style
and
plan
of
the
timaeus
differ
greatly
from
that
of
any
other
of
the
platonic
dialogues
the
language
is
weighty
abrupt
and
in
some
passages
sublime
but
plato
has
not
the
same
mastery
over
his
instrument
which
he
exhibits
in
the
phaedrus
or
symposium
nothing
can
exceed
the
beauty
or
art
of
the
introduction
in
which
he
is
using
words
after
his
accustomed
manner
but
in
the
rest
of
the
work
the
power
of
language
seems
to
fail
him
and
the
dramatic
form
is
wholly
given
up
he
could
write
in
one
style
but
not
in
another
and
the
greek
language
had
not
as
yet
been
fashioned
by
any
poet
or
philosopher
to
describe
physical
phenomena
the
early
physiologists
had
generally
written
in
verse
the
prose
writers
like
democritus
and
anaxagoras
as
far
as
we
can
judge
from
their
fragments
never
attained
to
a
periodic
style
and
hence
we
find
the
same
sort
of
clumsiness
in
the
timaeus
of
plato
which
characterizes
the
philosophical
poem
of
lucretius
there
is
a
want
of
flow
and
often
a
defect
of
rhythm
the
meaning
is
sometimes
obscure
and
there
is
a
greater
use
of
apposition
and
more
of
repetition
than
occurs
in
plato
earlier
writings
the
sentences
are
less
closely
connected
and
also
more
involved
the
antecedents
of
demonstrative
and
relative
pronouns
are
in
some
cases
remote
and
perplexing
the
greater
frequency
of
participles
and
of
absolute
constructions
gives
the
effect
of
heaviness
the
descriptive
portion
of
the
timaeus
retains
traces
of
the
first
greek
prose
composition
for
the
great
master
of
language
was
speaking
on
a
theme
with
which
he
was
imperfectly
acquainted
and
had
no
words
in
which
to
express
his
meaning
the
rugged
grandeur
of
the
opening
discourse
of
timaeus
may
be
compared
with
the
more
harmonious
beauty
of
a
similar
passage
in
the
phaedrus
to
the
same
cause
we
may
attribute
the
want
of
plan
plato
had
not
the
command
of
his
materials
which
would
have
enabled
him
to
produce
a
perfect
work
of
art
hence
there
are
several
new
beginnings
and
resumptions
and
formal
or
artificial
connections
we
miss
the
junctura
of
the
earlier
dialogues
his
speculations
about
the
eternal
his
theories
of
creation
his
mathematical
anticipations
are
supplemented
by
desultory
remarks
on
the
one
immortal
and
the
two
mortal
souls
of
man
on
the
functions
of
the
bodily
organs
in
health
and
disease
on
sight
hearing
smell
taste
and
touch
he
soars
into
the
heavens
and
then
as
if
his
wings
were
suddenly
clipped
he
walks
ungracefully
and
with
difficulty
upon
the
earth
the
greatest
things
in
the
world
and
the
least
things
in
man
are
brought
within
the
compass
of
a
short
treatise
but
the
intermediate
links
are
missing
and
we
can
not
be
surprised
that
there
should
be
a
want
of
unity
in
a
work
which
embraces
astronomy
theology
physiology
and
natural
philosophy
in
a
few
pages
it
is
not
easy
to
determine
how
plato
cosmos
may
be
presented
to
the
reader
in
a
clearer
and
shorter
form
or
how
we
may
supply
a
thread
of
connexion
to
his
ideas
without
giving
greater
consistency
to
them
than
they
possessed
in
his
mind
or
adding
on
consequences
which
would
never
have
occurred
to
him
for
he
has
glimpses
of
the
truth
but
no
comprehensive
or
perfect
vision
there
are
isolated
expressions
about
the
nature
of
god
which
have
a
wonderful
depth
and
power
but
we
are
not
justified
in
assuming
that
these
had
any
greater
significance
to
the
mind
of
plato
than
language
of
a
neutral
and
impersonal
character
with
a
view
to
the
illustration
of
the
timaeus
i
propose
to
divide
this
introduction
into
sections
of
which
the
first
will
contain
an
outline
of
the
dialogue
i
shall
consider
the
aspects
of
nature
which
presented
themselves
to
plato
and
his
age
and
the
elements
of
philosophy
which
entered
into
the
conception
of
them
the
theology
and
physics
of
the
timaeus
including
the
soul
of
the
world
the
conception
of
time
and
space
and
the
composition
of
the
elements
in
the
fourth
section
i
shall
consider
the
platonic
astronomy
and
the
position
of
the
earth
there
will
remain
the
psychology
the
physiology
of
plato
and
his
analysis
of
the
senses
to
be
briefly
commented
upon
lastly
we
may
examine
in
what
points
plato
approaches
or
anticipates
the
discoveries
of
modern
science
section
socrates
begins
the
timaeus
with
a
summary
of
the
republic
he
lightly
touches
upon
a
few
points
the
division
of
labour
and
distribution
of
the
citizens
into
classes
the
double
nature
and
training
of
the
guardians
the
community
of
property
and
of
women
and
children
but
he
makes
no
mention
of
the
second
education
or
of
the
government
of
philosophers
and
now
he
desires
to
see
the
ideal
state
set
in
motion
he
would
like
to
know
how
she
behaved
in
some
great
struggle
but
he
is
unable
to
invent
such
a
narrative
himself
and
he
is
afraid
that
the
poets
are
equally
incapable
for
although
he
pretends
to
have
nothing
to
say
against
them
he
remarks
that
they
are
a
tribe
of
imitators
who
can
only
describe
what
they
have
seen
and
he
fears
that
the
sophists
who
are
plentifully
supplied
with
graces
of
speech
in
their
erratic
way
of
life
having
never
had
a
city
or
house
of
their
own
may
through
want
of
experience
err
in
their
conception
of
philosophers
and
statesmen
therefore
to
you
i
turn
timaeus
citizen
of
locris
who
are
at
once
a
philosopher
and
a
statesman
and
to
you
critias
whom
all
athenians
know
to
be
similarly
accomplished
and
to
hermocrates
who
is
also
fitted
by
nature
and
education
to
share
in
our
discourse
hermocrates
will
do
our
best
and
have
been
already
preparing
for
on
our
way
home
critias
told
us
of
an
ancient
tradition
which
i
wish
critias
that
you
would
repeat
to
socrates
will
if
timaeus
approves
approve
listen
then
socrates
to
a
tale
of
solon
who
being
the
friend
of
dropidas
my
told
it
to
my
grandfather
critias
and
he
told
me
the
narrative
related
to
ancient
famous
actions
of
the
athenian
people
and
to
one
especially
which
i
will
rehearse
in
honour
of
you
and
of
the
goddess
critias
when
he
told
this
tale
of
the
olden
time
was
ninety
years
old
i
being
not
more
than
ten
the
occasion
of
the
rehearsal
was
the
day
of
the
apaturia
called
the
registration
of
youth
at
which
our
parents
gave
prizes
for
recitation
some
poems
of
solon
were
recited
by
the
boys
they
had
not
at
that
time
gone
out
of
fashion
and
the
recital
of
them
led
some
one
to
say
perhaps
in
compliment
to
critias
that
solon
was
not
only
the
wisest
of
men
but
also
the
best
of
poets
the
old
man
brightened
up
at
hearing
this
and
said
had
solon
only
had
the
leisure
which
was
required
to
complete
the
famous
legend
which
he
brought
with
him
from
egypt
he
would
have
been
as
distinguished
as
homer
and
hesiod
what
was
the
subject
of
the
poem
said
the
person
who
made
the
remark
the
subject
was
a
very
noble
one
he
described
the
most
famous
action
in
which
the
athenian
people
were
ever
engaged
but
the
memory
of
their
exploits
has
passed
away
owing
to
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
extinction
of
the
actors
us
said
the
other
whole
story
and
where
solon
heard
the
story
he
replied
there
is
at
the
head
of
the
egyptian
delta
where
the
river
nile
divides
a
city
and
district
called
sais
the
city
was
the
birthplace
of
king
amasis
and
is
under
the
protection
of
the
goddess
neith
or
athene
the
citizens
have
a
friendly
feeling
towards
the
athenians
believing
themselves
to
be
related
to
them
hither
came
solon
and
was
received
with
honour
and
here
he
first
learnt
by
conversing
with
the
egyptian
priests
how
ignorant
he
and
his
countrymen
were
of
antiquity
perceiving
this
and
with
the
view
of
eliciting
information
from
them
he
told
them
the
tales
of
phoroneus
and
niobe
and
also
of
deucalion
and
pyrrha
and
he
endeavoured
to
count
the
generations
which
had
since
passed
thereupon
an
aged
priest
said
to
him
solon
solon
you
hellenes
are
ever
young
and
there
is
no
old
man
who
is
a
hellene
do
you
mean
he
asked
mind
replied
the
priest
mean
to
say
that
you
are
children
there
is
no
opinion
or
tradition
of
knowledge
among
you
which
is
white
with
age
and
i
will
tell
you
why
like
the
rest
of
mankind
you
have
suffered
from
convulsions
of
nature
which
are
chiefly
brought
about
by
the
two
great
agencies
of
fire
and
water
the
former
is
symbolized
in
the
hellenic
tale
of
young
phaethon
who
drove
his
father
horses
the
wrong
way
and
having
burnt
up
the
earth
was
himself
burnt
up
by
a
thunderbolt
for
there
occurs
at
long
intervals
a
derangement
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
then
the
earth
is
destroyed
by
fire
at
such
times
and
when
fire
is
the
agent
those
who
dwell
by
rivers
or
on
the
seashore
are
safer
than
those
who
dwell
upon
high
and
dry
places
who
in
their
turn
are
safer
when
the
danger
is
from
water
now
the
nile
is
our
saviour
from
fire
and
as
there
is
little
rain
in
egypt
we
are
not
harmed
by
water
whereas
in
other
countries
when
a
deluge
comes
the
inhabitants
are
swept
by
the
rivers
into
the
sea
the
memorials
which
your
own
and
other
nations
have
once
had
of
the
famous
actions
of
mankind
perish
in
the
waters
at
certain
periods
and
the
rude
survivors
in
the
mountains
begin
again
knowing
nothing
of
the
world
before
the
flood
but
in
egypt
the
traditions
of
our
own
and
other
lands
are
by
us
registered
for
ever
in
our
temples
the
genealogies
which
you
have
recited
to
us
out
of
your
own
annals
solon
are
a
mere
children
story
for
in
the
first
place
you
remember
one
deluge
only
and
there
were
many
of
them
and
you
know
nothing
of
that
fairest
and
noblest
race
of
which
you
are
a
seed
or
remnant
the
memory
of
them
was
lost
because
there
was
no
written
voice
among
you
for
in
the
times
before
the
great
flood
athens
was
the
greatest
and
best
of
cities
and
did
the
noblest
deeds
and
had
the
best
constitution
of
any
under
the
face
of
heaven
solon
marvelled
and
desired
to
be
informed
of
the
particulars
are
welcome
to
hear
them
said
the
priest
for
your
own
sake
and
for
that
of
the
city
and
above
all
for
the
sake
of
the
goddess
who
is
the
common
foundress
of
both
our
cities
nine
thousand
years
have
elapsed
since
she
founded
yours
and
eight
thousand
since
she
founded
ours
as
our
annals
record
many
laws
exist
among
us
which
are
the
counterpart
of
yours
as
they
were
in
the
olden
time
i
will
briefly
describe
them
to
you
and
you
shall
read
the
account
of
them
at
your
leisure
in
the
sacred
registers
in
the
first
place
there
was
a
caste
of
priests
among
the
ancient
athenians
and
another
of
artisans
also
castes
of
shepherds
hunters
and
husbandmen
and
lastly
of
warriors
who
like
the
warriors
of
egypt
were
separated
from
the
rest
and
carried
shields
and
spears
a
custom
which
the
goddess
first
taught
you
and
then
the
asiatics
and
we
among
asiatics
first
received
from
her
observe
again
what
care
the
law
took
in
the
pursuit
of
wisdom
searching
out
the
deep
things
of
the
world
and
applying
them
to
the
use
of
man
the
spot
of
earth
which
the
goddess
chose
had
the
best
of
climates
and
produced
the
wisest
men
in
no
other
was
she
herself
the
philosopher
and
warrior
goddess
so
likely
to
have
votaries
and
there
you
dwelt
as
became
the
children
of
the
gods
excelling
all
men
in
virtue
and
many
famous
actions
are
recorded
of
you
the
most
famous
of
them
all
was
the
overthrow
of
the
island
of
atlantis
this
great
island
lay
over
against
the
pillars
of
heracles
in
extent
greater
than
libya
and
asia
put
together
and
was
the
passage
to
other
islands
and
to
a
great
ocean
of
which
the
mediterranean
sea
was
only
the
harbour
and
within
the
pillars
the
empire
of
atlantis
reached
in
europe
to
tyrrhenia
and
in
libya
to
egypt
this
mighty
power
was
arrayed
against
egypt
and
hellas
and
all
the
countries
bordering
on
the
mediterranean
then
your
city
did
bravely
and
won
renown
over
the
whole
earth
for
at
the
peril
of
her
own
existence
and
when
the
other
hellenes
had
deserted
her
she
repelled
the
invader
and
of
her
own
accord
gave
liberty
to
all
the
nations
within
the
pillars
a
little
while
afterwards
there
were
great
earthquakes
and
floods
and
your
warrior
race
all
sank
into
the
earth
and
the
great
island
of
atlantis
also
disappeared
in
the
sea
this
is
the
explanation
of
the
shallows
which
are
found
in
that
part
of
the
atlantic
ocean
such
was
the
tale
socrates
which
critias
heard
from
solon
and
i
noticed
when
listening
to
you
yesterday
how
close
the
resemblance
was
between
your
city
and
citizens
and
the
ancient
athenian
state
but
i
would
not
speak
at
the
time
because
i
wanted
to
refresh
my
memory
i
had
heard
the
old
man
when
i
was
a
child
and
though
i
could
not
remember
the
whole
of
our
yesterday
discourse
i
was
able
to
recall
every
word
of
this
which
is
branded
into
my
mind
and
i
am
prepared
socrates
to
rehearse
to
you
the
entire
narrative
the
imaginary
state
which
you
were
describing
may
be
identified
with
the
reality
of
solon
and
our
antediluvian
ancestors
may
be
your
citizens
is
excellent
critias
and
very
appropriate
to
a
panathenaic
festival
the
truth
of
the
story
is
a
great
advantage
then
now
let
me
explain
to
you
the
order
of
our
entertainment
first
timaeus
who
is
a
natural
philosopher
will
speak
of
the
origin
of
the
world
going
down
to
the
creation
of
man
and
then
i
shall
receive
the
men
whom
he
has
created
and
some
of
whom
will
have
been
educated
by
you
and
introduce
them
to
you
as
the
lost
athenian
citizens
of
whom
the
egyptian
record
spoke
as
the
law
of
solon
prescribes
we
will
bring
them
into
court
and
acknowledge
their
claims
to
citizenship
see
replied
socrates
i
shall
be
well
entertained
and
do
you
timaeus
offer
up
a
prayer
and
begin
timaeus
all
men
who
have
any
right
feeling
at
the
beginning
of
any
enterprise
call
upon
the
gods
and
he
who
is
about
to
speak
of
the
origin
of
the
universe
has
a
special
need
of
their
aid
may
my
words
be
acceptable
to
them
and
may
i
speak
in
the
manner
which
will
be
most
intelligible
to
you
and
will
best
express
my
own
meaning
first
i
must
distinguish
between
that
which
always
is
and
never
becomes
and
which
is
apprehended
by
reason
and
reflection
and
that
which
always
becomes
and
never
is
and
is
conceived
by
opinion
with
the
help
of
sense
all
that
becomes
and
is
created
is
the
work
of
a
cause
and
that
is
fair
which
the
artificer
makes
after
an
eternal
pattern
but
whatever
is
fashioned
after
a
created
pattern
is
not
fair
is
the
world
created
or
uncreated
that
is
the
first
question
created
i
reply
being
visible
and
tangible
and
having
a
body
and
therefore
sensible
and
if
sensible
then
created
and
if
created
made
by
a
cause
and
the
cause
is
the
ineffable
father
of
all
things
who
had
before
him
an
eternal
archetype
for
to
imagine
that
the
archetype
was
created
would
be
blasphemy
seeing
that
the
world
is
the
noblest
of
creations
and
god
is
the
best
of
causes
and
the
world
being
thus
created
according
to
the
eternal
pattern
is
the
copy
of
something
and
we
may
assume
that
words
are
akin
to
the
matter
of
which
they
speak
what
is
spoken
of
the
unchanging
or
intelligible
must
be
certain
and
true
but
what
is
spoken
of
the
created
image
can
only
be
probable
being
is
to
becoming
what
truth
is
to
belief
and
amid
the
variety
of
opinions
which
have
arisen
about
god
and
the
nature
of
the
world
we
must
be
content
to
take
probability
for
our
rule
considering
that
i
who
am
the
speaker
and
you
who
are
the
judges
are
only
men
to
probability
we
may
attain
but
no
further
socrates
excellent
timaeus
i
like
your
manner
of
approaching
the
subject
proceed
timaeus
why
did
the
creator
make
the
world
he
was
good
and
therefore
not
jealous
and
being
free
from
jealousy
he
desired
that
all
things
should
be
like
himself
wherefore
he
set
in
order
the
visible
world
which
he
found
in
disorder
now
he
who
is
the
best
could
only
create
the
fairest
and
reflecting
that
of
visible
things
the
intelligent
is
superior
to
the
unintelligent
he
put
intelligence
in
soul
and
soul
in
body
and
framed
the
universe
to
be
the
best
and
fairest
work
in
the
order
of
nature
and
the
world
became
a
living
soul
through
the
providence
of
god
in
the
likeness
of
what
animal
was
the
world
made
that
is
the
third
question
the
form
of
the
perfect
animal
was
a
whole
and
contained
all
intelligible
beings
and
the
visible
animal
made
after
the
pattern
of
this
included
all
visible
creatures
are
there
many
worlds
or
one
only
that
is
the
fourth
question
one
only
for
if
in
the
original
there
had
been
more
than
one
they
would
have
been
the
parts
of
a
third
which
would
have
been
the
true
pattern
of
the
world
and
therefore
there
is
and
will
ever
be
but
one
created
world
now
that
which
is
created
is
of
necessity
corporeal
and
visible
and
tangible
visible
and
therefore
made
of
fire
tangible
and
therefore
solid
and
made
of
earth
but
two
terms
must
be
united
by
a
third
which
is
a
mean
between
them
and
had
the
earth
been
a
surface
only
one
mean
would
have
sufficed
but
two
means
are
required
to
unite
solid
bodies
and
as
the
world
was
composed
of
solids
between
the
elements
of
fire
and
earth
god
placed
two
other
elements
of
air
and
water
and
arranged
them
in
a
continuous
proportion
fire
air
water
and
air
water
earth
and
so
put
together
a
visible
and
palpable
heaven
having
harmony
and
friendship
in
the
union
of
the
four
elements
and
being
at
unity
with
itself
it
was
indissoluble
except
by
the
hand
of
the
framer
each
of
the
elements
was
taken
into
the
universe
whole
and
entire
for
he
considered
that
the
animal
should
be
perfect
and
one
leaving
no
remnants
out
of
which
another
animal
could
be
created
and
should
also
be
free
from
old
age
and
disease
which
are
produced
by
the
action
of
external
forces
and
as
he
was
to
contain
all
things
he
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
sphere
round
as
from
a
lathe
and
every
way
equidistant
from
the
centre
as
was
natural
and
suitable
to
him
he
was
finished
and
smooth
having
neither
eyes
nor
ears
for
there
was
nothing
without
him
which
he
could
see
or
hear
and
he
had
no
need
to
carry
food
to
his
mouth
nor
was
there
air
for
him
to
breathe
and
he
did
not
require
hands
for
there
was
nothing
of
which
he
could
take
hold
nor
feet
with
which
to
walk
all
that
he
did
was
done
rationally
in
and
by
himself
and
he
moved
in
a
circle
turning
within
himself
which
is
the
most
intellectual
of
motions
but
the
other
six
motions
were
wanting
to
him
wherefore
the
universe
had
no
feet
or
legs
and
so
the
thought
of
god
made
a
god
in
the
image
of
a
perfect
body
having
intercourse
with
himself
and
needing
no
other
but
in
every
part
harmonious
and
and
truly
blessed
the
soul
was
first
made
by
him
the
elder
to
rule
the
younger
not
in
the
order
in
which
our
wayward
fancy
has
led
us
to
describe
them
but
the
soul
first
and
afterwards
the
body
god
took
of
the
unchangeable
and
indivisible
and
also
of
the
divisible
and
corporeal
and
out
of
the
two
he
made
a
third
nature
essence
which
was
in
a
mean
between
them
and
partook
of
the
same
and
the
other
the
intractable
nature
of
the
other
being
compressed
into
the
same
having
made
a
compound
of
all
the
three
he
proceeded
to
divide
the
entire
mass
into
portions
related
to
one
another
in
the
ratios
of
and
proceeded
to
fill
up
the
double
and
triple
intervals
thus
over
over
over
over
over
over
over
over
in
which
double
series
of
numbers
are
two
kinds
of
means
the
one
exceeds
and
is
exceeded
by
equal
parts
of
the
extremes
the
other
kind
of
mean
is
one
which
is
equidistant
from
the
extremes
in
this
manner
there
were
formed
intervals
of
thirds
of
fourths
and
of
ninths
and
next
he
filled
up
the
intervals
of
a
fourth
with
ninths
leaving
a
remnant
which
is
in
the
ratio
of
the
entire
compound
was
divided
by
him
lengthways
into
two
parts
which
he
united
at
the
centre
like
the
letter
x
and
bent
into
an
inner
and
outer
circle
or
sphere
cutting
one
another
again
at
a
point
over
against
the
point
at
which
they
cross
the
outer
circle
or
sphere
was
named
the
sphere
of
the
same
the
inner
the
sphere
of
the
other
or
diverse
and
the
one
revolved
horizontally
to
the
right
the
other
diagonally
to
the
left
to
the
sphere
of
the
same
which
was
undivided
he
gave
dominion
but
the
sphere
of
the
other
or
diverse
was
distributed
into
seven
unequal
orbits
having
intervals
in
ratios
of
twos
and
threes
three
of
either
sort
and
he
bade
the
orbits
move
in
opposite
directions
to
one
another
three
of
them
the
sun
mercury
venus
with
equal
swiftness
and
the
remaining
four
the
moon
saturn
mars
jupiter
with
unequal
swiftness
to
the
three
and
to
one
another
but
all
in
due
proportion
when
the
creator
had
made
the
soul
he
made
the
body
within
her
and
the
soul
interfused
everywhere
from
the
centre
to
the
circumference
of
heaven
herself
turning
in
herself
began
a
divine
life
of
rational
and
everlasting
motion
the
body
of
heaven
is
visible
but
the
soul
is
invisible
and
partakes
of
reason
and
harmony
and
is
the
best
of
creations
being
the
work
of
the
best
and
being
composed
of
the
same
the
other
and
the
essence
these
three
and
also
divided
and
bound
in
harmonical
proportion
and
revolving
within
herself
the
soul
when
touching
anything
which
has
essence
whether
divided
or
undivided
is
stirred
to
utter
the
sameness
or
diversity
of
that
and
some
other
thing
and
to
tell
how
and
when
and
where
individuals
are
affected
or
related
whether
in
the
world
of
change
or
of
essence
when
reason
is
in
the
neighbourhood
of
sense
and
the
circle
of
the
other
or
diverse
is
moving
truly
then
arise
true
opinions
and
beliefs
when
reason
is
in
the
sphere
of
thought
and
the
circle
of
the
same
runs
smoothly
then
intelligence
is
perfected
when
the
father
who
begat
the
world
saw
the
image
which
he
had
made
of
the
eternal
gods
moving
and
living
he
rejoiced
and
in
his
joy
resolved
since
the
archetype
was
eternal
to
make
the
creature
eternal
as
far
as
this
was
possible
wherefore
he
made
an
image
of
eternity
which
is
time
having
an
uniform
motion
according
to
number
parted
into
months
and
days
and
years
and
also
having
greater
divisions
of
past
present
and
future
these
all
apply
to
becoming
in
time
and
have
no
meaning
in
relation
to
the
eternal
nature
which
ever
is
and
never
was
or
will
be
for
the
unchangeable
is
never
older
or
younger
and
when
we
say
that
he
or
be
we
are
mistaken
for
these
words
are
applicable
only
to
becoming
and
not
to
true
being
and
equally
wrong
are
we
in
saying
that
what
has
become
is
become
and
that
what
becomes
is
becoming
and
that
the
is
these
are
the
forms
of
time
which
imitate
eternity
and
move
in
a
circle
measured
by
number
thus
was
time
made
in
the
image
of
the
eternal
nature
and
it
was
created
together
with
the
heavens
in
order
that
if
they
were
dissolved
it
might
perish
with
them
and
god
made
the
sun
and
moon
and
five
other
wanderers
as
they
are
called
seven
in
all
and
to
each
of
them
he
gave
a
body
moving
in
an
orbit
being
one
of
the
seven
orbits
into
which
the
circle
of
the
other
was
divided
he
put
the
moon
in
the
orbit
which
was
nearest
to
the
earth
the
sun
in
that
next
the
morning
star
and
mercury
in
the
orbits
which
move
opposite
to
the
sun
but
with
equal
swiftness
this
being
the
reason
why
they
overtake
and
are
overtaken
by
one
another
all
these
bodies
became
living
creatures
and
learnt
their
appointed
tasks
and
began
to
move
the
nearer
more
swiftly
the
remoter
more
slowly
according
to
the
diagonal
movement
of
the
other
and
since
this
was
controlled
by
the
movement
of
the
same
the
seven
planets
in
their
courses
appeared
to
describe
spirals
and
that
appeared
fastest
which
was
slowest
and
that
which
overtook
others
appeared
to
be
overtaken
by
them
and
god
lighted
a
fire
in
the
second
orbit
from
the
earth
which
is
called
the
sun
to
give
light
over
the
whole
heaven
and
to
teach
intelligent
beings
that
knowledge
of
number
which
is
derived
from
the
revolution
of
the
same
thus
arose
day
and
night
which
are
the
periods
of
the
most
intelligent
nature
a
month
is
created
by
the
revolution
of
the
moon
a
year
by
that
of
the
sun
other
periods
of
wonderful
length
and
complexity
are
not
observed
by
men
in
general
there
is
moreover
a
cycle
or
perfect
year
at
the
completion
of
which
they
all
meet
and
coincide
to
this
end
the
stars
came
into
being
that
the
created
heaven
might
imitate
the
eternal
nature
thus
far
the
universal
animal
was
made
in
the
divine
image
but
the
other
animals
were
not
as
yet
included
in
him
and
god
created
them
according
to
the
patterns
or
species
of
them
which
existed
in
the
divine
original
there
are
four
of
them
one
of
gods
another
of
birds
a
third
of
fishes
and
a
fourth
of
animals
the
gods
were
made
in
the
form
of
a
circle
which
is
the
most
perfect
figure
and
the
figure
of
the
universe
they
were
created
chiefly
of
fire
that
they
might
be
bright
and
were
made
to
know
and
follow
the
best
and
to
be
scattered
over
the
heavens
of
which
they
were
to
be
the
glory
two
kinds
of
motion
were
assigned
to
them
first
the
revolution
in
the
same
and
around
the
same
in
peaceful
unchanging
thought
of
the
same
and
to
this
was
added
a
forward
motion
which
was
under
the
control
of
the
same
thus
then
the
fixed
stars
were
created
being
divine
and
eternal
animals
revolving
on
the
same
spot
and
the
wandering
stars
in
their
courses
were
created
in
the
manner
already
described
the
earth
which
is
our
nurse
clinging
around
the
pole
extended
through
the
universe
he
made
to
be
the
guardian
and
artificer
of
night
and
day
first
and
eldest
of
gods
that
are
in
the
interior
of
heaven
vain
would
be
the
labour
of
telling
all
the
figures
of
them
moving
as
in
dance
and
their
and
approximations
and
when
and
where
and
behind
what
other
stars
they
appear
to
disappear
to
tell
of
all
this
without
looking
at
a
plan
of
them
would
be
labour
in
vain
the
knowledge
of
the
other
gods
is
beyond
us
and
we
can
only
accept
the
traditions
of
the
ancients
who
were
the
children
of
the
gods
as
they
said
for
surely
they
must
have
known
their
own
ancestors
although
they
give
no
proof
we
must
believe
them
as
is
customary
they
tell
us
that
oceanus
and
tethys
were
the
children
of
earth
and
heaven
that
phoreys
cronos
and
rhea
came
in
the
next
generation
and
were
followed
by
zeus
and
here
whose
brothers
and
children
are
known
to
everybody
when
all
of
them
both
those
who
show
themselves
in
the
sky
and
those
who
retire
from
view
had
come
into
being
the
creator
addressed
them
thus
sons
of
gods
my
works
if
i
will
are
indissoluble
that
which
is
bound
may
be
dissolved
but
only
an
evil
being
would
dissolve
that
which
is
harmonious
and
happy
and
although
you
are
not
immortal
you
shall
not
die
for
i
will
hold
you
together
hear
me
then
three
tribes
of
mortal
beings
have
still
to
be
created
but
if
created
by
me
they
would
be
like
gods
do
ye
therefore
make
them
i
will
implant
in
them
the
seed
of
immortality
and
you
shall
weave
together
the
mortal
and
immortal
and
provide
food
for
them
and
receive
them
again
in
death
thus
he
spake
and
poured
the
remains
of
the
elements
into
the
cup
in
which
he
had
mingled
the
soul
of
the
universe
they
were
no
longer
pure
as
before
but
diluted
and
the
mixture
he
distributed
into
souls
equal
in
number
to
the
stars
and
assigned
each
to
a
star
then
having
mounted
them
as
in
a
chariot
he
showed
them
the
nature
of
the
universe
and
told
them
of
their
future
birth
and
human
lot
they
were
to
be
sown
in
the
planets
and
out
of
them
was
to
come
forth
the
most
religious
of
animals
which
would
hereafter
be
called
man
the
souls
were
to
be
implanted
in
bodies
which
were
in
a
perpetual
flux
whence
he
said
would
arise
first
sensation
secondly
love
which
is
a
mixture
of
pleasure
and
pain
thirdly
fear
and
anger
and
the
opposite
affections
and
if
they
conquered
these
they
would
live
righteously
but
if
they
were
conquered
by
them
unrighteously
he
who
lived
well
would
return
to
his
native
star
and
would
there
have
a
blessed
existence
but
if
he
lived
ill
he
would
pass
into
the
nature
of
a
woman
and
if
he
did
not
then
alter
his
evil
ways
into
the
likeness
of
some
animal
until
the
reason
which
was
in
him
reasserted
her
sway
over
the
elements
of
fire
air
earth
water
which
had
engrossed
her
and
he
regained
his
first
and
better
nature
having
given
this
law
to
his
creatures
that
he
might
be
guiltless
of
their
future
evil
he
sowed
them
some
in
the
earth
some
in
the
moon
and
some
in
the
other
planets
and
he
ordered
the
younger
gods
to
frame
human
bodies
for
them
and
to
make
the
necessary
additions
to
them
and
to
avert
from
them
all
but
evil
having
given
these
commands
the
creator
remained
in
his
own
nature
and
his
children
receiving
from
him
the
immortal
principle
borrowed
from
the
world
portions
of
earth
air
fire
water
hereafter
to
be
returned
which
they
fastened
together
not
with
the
adamantine
bonds
which
bound
themselves
but
by
little
invisible
pegs
making
each
separate
body
out
of
all
the
elements
subject
to
influx
and
efflux
and
containing
the
courses
of
the
soul
these
swelling
and
surging
as
in
a
river
moved
irregularly
and
irrationally
in
all
the
six
possible
ways
forwards
backwards
right
left
up
and
down
but
violent
as
were
the
internal
and
alimentary
fluids
the
tide
became
still
more
violent
when
the
body
came
into
contact
with
flaming
fire
or
the
solid
earth
or
gliding
waters
or
the
stormy
wind
the
motions
produced
by
these
impulses
pass
through
the
body
to
the
soul
and
have
the
name
of
sensations
uniting
with
the
current
they
shake
the
courses
of
the
soul
stopping
the
revolution
of
the
same
and
twisting
in
all
sorts
of
ways
the
nature
of
the
other
and
the
harmonical
ratios
of
twos
and
threes
and
the
mean
terms
which
connect
them
until
the
circles
are
bent
and
disordered
and
their
motion
becomes
irregular
you
may
imagine
a
position
of
the
body
in
which
the
head
is
resting
upon
the
ground
and
the
legs
are
in
the
air
and
the
top
is
bottom
and
the
left
right
and
something
similar
happens
when
the
disordered
motions
of
the
soul
come
into
contact
with
any
external
thing
they
say
the
same
or
the
other
in
a
manner
which
is
the
very
opposite
of
the
truth
and
they
are
false
and
foolish
and
have
no
guiding
principle
in
them
and
when
external
impressions
enter
in
they
are
really
conquered
though
they
seem
to
conquer
by
reason
of
these
affections
the
soul
is
at
first
without
intelligence
but
as
time
goes
on
the
stream
of
nutriment
abates
and
the
courses
of
the
soul
regain
their
proper
motion
and
apprehend
the
same
and
the
other
rightly
and
become
rational
the
soul
of
him
who
has
education
is
whole
and
perfect
and
escapes
the
worst
disease
but
if
a
education
be
neglected
he
walks
lamely
through
life
and
returns
good
for
nothing
to
the
world
below
this
however
is
an
at
present
we
are
only
concerned
with
the
creation
of
the
body
and
soul
the
two
divine
courses
were
encased
by
the
gods
in
a
sphere
which
is
called
the
head
and
is
the
god
and
lord
of
us
and
to
this
they
gave
the
body
to
be
a
vehicle
and
the
members
to
be
instruments
having
the
power
of
flexion
and
extension
such
was
the
origin
of
legs
and
arms
in
the
next
place
the
gods
gave
a
forward
motion
to
the
human
body
because
the
front
part
of
man
was
the
more
honourable
and
had
authority
and
they
put
in
a
face
in
which
they
inserted
organs
to
minister
in
all
things
to
the
providence
of
the
soul
they
first
contrived
the
eyes
into
which
they
conveyed
a
light
akin
to
the
light
of
day
making
it
flow
through
the
pupils
when
the
light
of
the
eye
is
surrounded
by
the
light
of
day
then
like
falls
upon
like
and
they
unite
and
form
one
body
which
conveys
to
the
soul
the
motions
of
visible
objects
but
when
the
visual
ray
goes
forth
into
the
darkness
then
unlike
falls
upon
unlike
the
eye
no
longer
sees
and
we
go
to
sleep
the
fire
or
light
when
kept
in
by
the
eyelids
equalizes
the
inward
motions
and
there
is
rest
accompanied
by
few
dreams
only
when
the
greater
motions
remain
they
engender
in
us
corresponding
visions
of
the
night
and
now
we
shall
be
able
to
understand
the
nature
of
reflections
in
mirrors
the
fires
from
within
and
from
without
meet
about
the
smooth
and
bright
surface
of
the
mirror
and
because
they
meet
in
a
manner
contrary
to
the
usual
mode
the
right
and
left
sides
of
the
object
are
transposed
in
a
concave
mirror
the
top
and
bottom
are
inverted
but
this
is
no
transposition
these
are
the
second
causes
which
god
used
as
his
ministers
in
fashioning
the
world
they
are
thought
by
many
to
be
the
prime
causes
but
they
are
not
so
for
they
are
destitute
of
mind
and
reason
and
the
lover
of
mind
will
not
allow
that
there
are
any
prime
causes
other
than
the
rational
and
invisible
ones
these
he
investigates
first
and
afterwards
the
causes
of
things
which
are
moved
by
others
and
which
work
by
chance
and
without
order
of
the
second
or
concurrent
causes
of
sight
i
have
already
spoken
and
i
will
now
speak
of
the
higher
purpose
of
god
in
giving
us
eyes
sight
is
the
source
of
the
greatest
benefits
to
us
for
if
our
eyes
had
never
seen
the
sun
stars
and
heavens
the
words
which
we
have
spoken
would
not
have
been
uttered
the
sight
of
them
and
their
revolutions
has
given
us
the
knowledge
of
number
and
time
the
power
of
enquiry
and
philosophy
which
is
the
great
blessing
of
human
life
not
to
speak
of
the
lesser
benefits
which
even
the
vulgar
can
appreciate
god
gave
us
the
faculty
of
sight
that
we
might
behold
the
order
of
the
heavens
and
create
a
corresponding
order
in
our
own
erring
minds
to
the
like
end
the
gifts
of
speech
and
hearing
were
bestowed
upon
us
not
for
the
sake
of
irrational
pleasure
but
in
order
that
we
might
harmonize
the
courses
of
the
soul
by
sympathy
with
the
harmony
of
sound
and
cure
ourselves
of
our
irregular
and
graceless
ways
thus
far
we
have
spoken
of
the
works
of
mind
and
there
are
other
works
done
from
necessity
which
we
must
now
place
beside
them
for
the
creation
is
made
up
of
both
mind
persuading
necessity
as
far
as
possible
to
work
out
good
before
the
heavens
there
existed
fire
air
water
earth
which
we
suppose
men
to
know
though
no
one
has
explained
their
nature
and
we
erroneously
maintain
them
to
be
the
letters
or
elements
of
the
whole
although
they
can
not
reasonably
be
compared
even
to
syllables
or
first
compounds
i
am
not
now
speaking
of
the
first
principles
of
things
because
i
can
not
discover
them
by
our
present
mode
of
enquiry
but
as
i
observed
the
rule
of
probability
at
first
i
will
begin
anew
seeking
by
the
grace
of
god
to
observe
it
still
in
our
former
discussion
i
distinguished
two
kinds
of
being
the
unchanging
or
invisible
and
the
visible
or
changing
but
now
a
third
kind
is
required
which
i
shall
call
the
receptacle
or
nurse
of
generation
there
is
a
difficulty
in
arriving
at
an
exact
notion
of
this
third
kind
because
the
four
elements
themselves
are
of
inexact
natures
and
easily
pass
into
one
another
and
are
too
transient
to
be
detained
by
any
one
name
wherefore
we
are
compelled
to
speak
of
water
or
fire
not
as
substances
but
as
qualities
they
may
be
compared
to
images
made
of
gold
which
are
continually
assuming
new
forms
somebody
asks
what
they
are
if
you
do
not
know
the
safest
answer
is
to
reply
that
they
are
gold
in
like
manner
there
is
a
universal
nature
out
of
which
all
things
are
made
and
which
is
like
none
of
them
but
they
enter
into
and
pass
out
of
her
and
are
made
after
patterns
of
the
true
in
a
wonderful
and
inexplicable
manner
the
containing
principle
may
be
likened
to
a
mother
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
and
we
may
also
remark
that
the
matter
which
receives
every
variety
of
form
must
be
formless
like
the
inodorous
liquids
which
are
prepared
to
receive
scents
or
the
smooth
and
soft
materials
on
which
figures
are
impressed
in
the
same
way
space
or
matter
is
neither
earth
nor
fire
nor
air
nor
water
but
an
invisible
and
formless
being
which
receives
all
things
and
in
an
incomprehensible
manner
partakes
of
the
intelligible
but
we
may
say
speaking
generally
that
fire
is
that
part
of
this
nature
which
is
inflamed
water
that
which
is
moistened
and
the
like
let
me
ask
a
question
in
which
a
great
principle
is
involved
is
there
an
essence
of
fire
and
the
other
elements
or
are
there
only
fires
visible
to
sense
i
answer
in
a
word
if
mind
is
one
thing
and
true
opinion
another
then
there
are
essences
but
if
mind
is
the
same
with
opinion
then
the
visible
and
corporeal
is
most
real
but
they
are
not
the
same
and
they
have
a
different
origin
and
nature
the
one
comes
to
us
by
instruction
the
other
by
persuasion
the
one
is
rational
the
other
is
irrational
the
one
is
movable
by
persuasion
the
other
immovable
the
one
is
possessed
by
every
man
the
other
by
the
gods
and
by
very
few
men
and
we
must
acknowledge
that
as
there
are
two
kinds
of
knowledge
so
there
are
two
kinds
of
being
corresponding
to
them
the
one
uncreated
indestructible
immovable
which
is
seen
by
intelligence
only
the
other
created
which
is
always
becoming
in
place
and
vanishing
out
of
place
and
is
apprehended
by
opinion
and
sense
there
is
also
a
third
nature
that
of
space
which
is
indestructible
and
is
perceived
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
without
the
help
of
sense
this
is
presented
to
us
in
a
dreamy
manner
and
yet
is
said
to
be
necessary
for
we
say
that
all
things
must
be
somewhere
in
space
for
they
are
the
images
of
other
things
and
must
therefore
have
a
separate
existence
and
exist
in
something
in
space
but
true
reason
assures
us
that
while
two
things
the
idea
and
the
image
are
different
they
can
not
inhere
in
one
another
so
as
to
be
one
and
two
at
the
same
time
to
sum
up
being
and
generation
and
space
these
three
existed
before
the
heavens
and
the
nurse
or
vessel
of
generation
moistened
by
water
and
inflamed
by
fire
and
taking
the
forms
of
air
and
earth
assumed
various
shapes
by
the
motion
of
the
vessel
the
elements
were
divided
and
like
grain
winnowed
by
fans
the
close
and
heavy
particles
settled
in
one
place
the
light
and
airy
ones
in
another
at
first
they
were
without
reason
and
measure
and
had
only
certain
faint
traces
of
themselves
until
god
fashioned
them
by
figure
and
number
in
this
as
in
every
other
part
of
creation
i
suppose
god
to
have
made
things
as
far
as
was
possible
fair
and
good
out
of
things
not
fair
and
good
and
now
i
will
explain
to
you
the
generation
of
the
world
by
a
method
with
which
your
scientific
training
will
have
made
you
familiar
fire
air
earth
and
water
are
bodies
and
therefore
solids
and
solids
are
contained
in
planes
and
plane
rectilinear
figures
are
made
up
of
triangles
of
triangles
there
are
two
kinds
one
having
the
opposite
sides
equal
isosceles
the
other
with
unequal
sides
scalene
these
we
may
fairly
assume
to
be
the
original
elements
of
fire
and
the
other
bodies
what
principles
are
prior
to
these
god
only
knows
and
he
of
men
whom
god
loves
next
we
must
determine
what
are
the
four
most
beautiful
figures
which
are
unlike
one
another
and
yet
sometimes
capable
of
resolution
into
one
another
of
the
two
kinds
of
triangles
the
has
but
one
form
the
has
an
infinite
variety
of
forms
and
there
is
none
more
beautiful
than
that
which
forms
the
half
of
an
equilateral
triangle
let
us
then
choose
two
triangles
one
the
isosceles
the
other
that
form
of
scalene
which
has
the
square
of
the
longer
side
three
times
as
great
as
the
square
of
the
lesser
side
and
affirm
that
out
of
these
fire
and
the
other
elements
have
been
constructed
i
was
wrong
in
imagining
that
all
the
four
elements
could
be
generated
into
and
out
of
one
another
for
as
they
are
formed
three
of
them
from
the
triangle
which
has
the
sides
unequal
the
fourth
from
the
triangle
which
has
equal
sides
three
can
be
resolved
into
one
another
but
the
fourth
can
not
be
resolved
into
them
nor
they
into
it
so
much
for
their
passage
into
one
another
i
must
now
speak
of
their
construction
from
the
triangle
of
which
the
hypotenuse
is
twice
the
lesser
side
the
three
first
regular
solids
are
formed
first
the
equilateral
pyramid
or
tetrahedron
secondly
the
octahedron
thirdly
the
icosahedron
and
from
the
isosceles
triangle
is
formed
the
cube
and
there
is
a
fifth
figure
which
is
made
out
of
twelve
pentagons
the
dodecahedron
this
god
used
as
a
model
for
the
twelvefold
division
of
the
zodiac
let
us
now
assign
the
geometrical
forms
to
their
respective
elements
the
cube
is
the
most
stable
of
them
because
resting
on
a
quadrangular
plane
surface
and
composed
of
isosceles
triangles
to
the
earth
then
which
is
the
most
stable
of
bodies
and
the
most
easily
modelled
of
them
may
be
assigned
the
form
of
a
cube
and
the
remaining
forms
to
the
other
elements
to
fire
the
pyramid
to
air
the
octahedron
and
to
water
the
icosahedron
according
to
their
degrees
of
lightness
or
heaviness
or
power
or
want
of
power
of
penetration
the
single
particles
of
any
of
the
elements
are
not
seen
by
reason
of
their
smallness
they
only
become
visible
when
collected
the
ratios
of
their
motions
numbers
and
other
properties
are
ordered
by
the
god
who
harmonized
them
as
far
as
necessity
permitted
the
probable
conclusion
is
as
follows
earth
when
dissolved
by
the
more
penetrating
element
of
fire
whether
acting
immediately
or
through
the
medium
of
air
or
water
is
decomposed
but
not
transformed
water
when
divided
by
fire
or
air
becomes
one
part
fire
and
two
parts
air
a
volume
of
air
divided
becomes
two
of
fire
on
the
other
hand
when
condensed
two
volumes
of
fire
make
a
volume
of
air
and
two
and
a
half
parts
of
air
condense
into
one
of
water
any
element
which
is
fastened
upon
by
fire
is
cut
by
the
sharpness
of
the
triangles
until
at
length
coalescing
with
the
fire
it
is
at
rest
for
similars
are
not
affected
by
similars
when
two
kinds
of
bodies
quarrel
with
one
another
then
the
tendency
to
decomposition
continues
until
the
smaller
either
escapes
to
its
kindred
element
or
becomes
one
with
its
conqueror
and
this
tendency
in
bodies
to
condense
or
escape
is
a
source
of
motion
where
there
is
motion
there
must
be
a
mover
and
where
there
is
a
mover
there
must
be
something
to
move
these
can
not
exist
in
what
is
uniform
and
therefore
motion
is
due
to
want
of
uniformity
but
then
why
when
things
are
divided
after
their
kinds
do
they
not
cease
from
motion
the
answer
is
that
the
circular
motion
of
all
things
compresses
them
and
as
abhors
a
vacuum
the
finer
and
more
subtle
particles
of
the
lighter
elements
such
as
fire
and
air
are
thrust
into
the
interstices
of
the
larger
each
of
them
penetrating
according
to
their
rarity
and
thus
all
the
elements
are
on
their
way
up
and
down
everywhere
and
always
into
their
own
places
hence
there
is
a
principle
of
inequality
and
therefore
of
motion
in
all
time
in
the
next
place
we
may
observe
that
there
are
different
kinds
of
fire
flame
light
that
burns
not
the
red
heat
of
the
embers
of
fire
and
there
are
varieties
of
air
as
for
example
the
pure
aether
the
opaque
mist
and
other
nameless
forms
water
again
is
of
two
kinds
liquid
and
fusile
the
liquid
is
composed
of
small
and
unequal
particles
the
fusile
of
large
and
uniform
particles
and
is
more
solid
but
nevertheless
melts
at
the
approach
of
fire
and
then
spreads
upon
the
earth
when
the
substance
cools
the
fire
passes
into
the
air
which
is
displaced
and
forces
together
and
condenses
the
liquid
mass
this
process
is
called
cooling
and
congealment
of
the
fusile
kinds
the
fairest
and
heaviest
is
gold
this
is
hardened
by
filtration
through
rock
and
is
of
a
bright
yellow
colour
a
shoot
of
gold
which
is
darker
and
denser
than
the
rest
is
called
adamant
another
kind
is
called
copper
which
is
harder
and
yet
lighter
because
the
interstices
are
larger
than
in
gold
there
is
mingled
with
it
a
fine
and
small
portion
of
earth
which
comes
out
in
the
form
of
rust
these
are
a
few
of
the
conjectures
which
philosophy
forms
when
leaving
the
eternal
nature
she
turns
for
innocent
recreation
to
consider
the
truths
of
generation
water
which
is
mingled
with
fire
is
called
liquid
because
it
rolls
upon
the
earth
and
soft
because
its
bases
give
way
this
becomes
more
equable
when
separated
from
fire
and
air
and
then
congeals
into
hail
or
ice
or
the
looser
forms
of
hoar
frost
or
snow
there
are
other
waters
which
are
called
juices
and
are
distilled
through
plants
of
these
we
may
mention
first
wine
which
warms
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
secondly
oily
substances
as
for
example
oil
or
pitch
thirdly
honey
which
relaxes
the
contracted
parts
of
the
mouth
and
so
produces
sweetness
fourthly
vegetable
acid
which
is
frothy
and
has
a
burning
quality
and
dissolves
the
flesh
of
the
kinds
of
earth
that
which
is
filtered
through
water
passes
into
stone
the
water
is
broken
up
by
the
earth
and
escapes
in
the
form
of
air
this
in
turn
presses
upon
the
mass
of
earth
and
the
earth
compressed
into
an
indissoluble
union
with
the
remaining
water
becomes
rock
rock
when
it
is
made
up
of
equal
particles
is
fair
and
transparent
but
the
reverse
when
of
unequal
earth
is
converted
into
pottery
when
the
watery
part
is
suddenly
drawn
away
or
if
moisture
remains
the
earth
when
fused
by
fire
becomes
on
cooling
a
stone
of
a
black
colour
when
the
earth
is
finer
and
of
a
briny
nature
then
two
bodies
are
formed
by
separating
the
water
soda
and
salt
the
strong
compounds
of
earth
and
water
are
not
soluble
by
water
but
only
by
fire
earth
itself
when
not
consolidated
is
dissolved
by
water
when
consolidated
by
fire
only
the
cohesion
of
water
when
strong
is
dissolved
by
fire
only
when
weak
either
by
air
or
fire
the
former
entering
the
interstices
the
latter
penetrating
even
the
triangles
air
when
strongly
condensed
is
indissoluble
by
any
power
which
does
not
reach
the
triangles
and
even
when
not
strongly
condensed
is
only
resolved
by
fire
compounds
of
earth
and
water
are
unaffected
by
water
while
the
water
occupies
the
interstices
in
them
but
begin
to
liquefy
when
fire
enters
into
the
interstices
of
the
water
they
are
of
two
kinds
some
of
them
like
glass
having
more
earth
others
like
wax
having
more
water
in
them
having
considered
objects
of
sense
we
now
pass
on
to
sensation
but
we
can
not
explain
sensation
without
explaining
the
nature
of
flesh
and
of
the
mortal
soul
and
as
we
can
not
treat
of
both
together
in
order
that
we
may
proceed
at
once
to
the
sensations
we
must
assume
the
existence
of
body
and
soul
what
makes
fire
burn
the
fineness
of
the
sides
the
sharpness
of
the
angles
the
smallness
of
the
particles
the
quickness
of
the
motion
moreover
the
pyramid
which
is
the
figure
of
fire
is
more
cutting
than
any
other
the
feeling
of
cold
is
produced
by
the
larger
particles
of
moisture
outside
the
body
trying
to
eject
the
smaller
ones
in
the
body
which
they
compress
the
struggle
which
arises
between
elements
thus
unnaturally
brought
together
causes
shivering
that
is
hard
to
which
the
flesh
yields
and
soft
which
yields
to
the
flesh
and
these
two
terms
are
also
relative
to
one
another
the
yielding
matter
is
that
which
has
the
slenderest
base
whereas
that
which
has
a
rectangular
base
is
compact
and
repellent
light
and
heavy
are
wrongly
explained
with
reference
to
a
lower
and
higher
in
place
for
in
the
universe
which
is
a
sphere
there
is
no
opposition
of
above
or
below
and
that
which
is
to
us
above
would
be
below
to
a
man
standing
at
the
antipodes
the
greater
or
less
difficulty
in
detaching
any
element
from
its
like
is
the
real
cause
of
heaviness
or
of
lightness
if
you
draw
the
earth
into
the
dissimilar
air
the
particles
of
earth
cling
to
their
native
element
and
you
more
easily
detach
a
small
portion
than
a
large
there
would
be
the
same
difficulty
in
moving
any
of
the
upper
elements
towards
the
lower
the
smooth
and
the
rough
are
severally
produced
by
the
union
of
evenness
with
compactness
and
of
hardness
with
inequality
pleasure
and
pain
are
the
most
important
of
the
affections
common
to
the
whole
body
according
to
our
general
doctrine
of
sensation
parts
of
the
body
which
are
easily
moved
readily
transmit
the
motion
to
the
mind
but
parts
which
are
not
easily
moved
have
no
effect
upon
the
patient
the
bones
and
hair
are
of
the
latter
kind
sight
and
hearing
of
the
former
ordinary
affections
are
neither
pleasant
nor
painful
the
impressions
of
sight
afford
an
example
of
these
and
are
neither
violent
nor
sudden
but
sudden
replenishments
of
the
body
cause
pleasure
and
sudden
disturbances
as
for
example
cuttings
and
burnings
have
the
opposite
effect
from
sensations
common
to
the
whole
body
we
proceed
to
those
of
particular
parts
the
affections
of
the
tongue
appear
to
be
caused
by
contraction
and
dilation
but
they
have
more
of
roughness
or
smoothness
than
is
found
in
other
affections
earthy
particles
entering
into
the
small
veins
of
the
tongue
which
reach
to
the
heart
when
they
melt
into
and
dry
up
the
little
veins
are
astringent
if
they
are
rough
or
if
not
so
rough
they
are
only
harsh
and
if
excessively
abstergent
like
potash
and
soda
bitter
purgatives
of
a
weaker
sort
are
called
salt
and
having
no
bitterness
are
rather
agreeable
inflammatory
bodies
which
by
their
lightness
are
carried
up
into
the
head
cutting
all
that
comes
in
their
way
are
termed
pungent
but
when
these
are
refined
by
putrefaction
and
enter
the
narrow
veins
of
the
tongue
and
meet
there
particles
of
earth
and
air
two
kinds
of
globules
are
formed
one
of
earthy
and
impure
liquid
which
boils
and
ferments
the
other
of
pure
and
transparent
water
which
are
called
bubbles
of
all
these
affections
the
cause
is
termed
acid
when
on
the
other
hand
the
composition
of
the
deliquescent
particles
is
congenial
to
the
tongue
and
disposes
the
parts
according
to
their
nature
this
remedial
power
in
them
is
called
sweet
smells
are
not
divided
into
kinds
all
of
them
are
transitional
and
arise
out
of
the
decomposition
of
one
element
into
another
for
the
simple
air
or
water
is
without
smell
they
are
vapours
or
mists
thinner
than
water
and
thicker
than
air
and
hence
in
drawing
in
the
breath
when
there
is
an
obstruction
the
air
passes
but
there
is
no
smell
they
have
no
names
but
are
distinguished
as
pleasant
and
unpleasant
and
their
influence
extends
over
the
whole
region
from
the
head
to
the
navel
hearing
is
the
effect
of
a
stroke
which
is
transmitted
through
the
ears
by
means
of
the
air
brain
and
blood
to
the
soul
beginning
at
the
head
and
extending
to
the
liver
the
sound
which
moves
swiftly
is
acute
that
which
moves
slowly
is
grave
that
which
is
uniform
is
smooth
and
the
opposite
is
harsh
loudness
depends
on
the
quantity
of
the
sound
of
the
harmony
of
sounds
i
will
hereafter
speak
colours
are
flames
which
emanate
from
all
bodies
having
particles
corresponding
to
the
sense
of
sight
some
of
the
particles
are
less
and
some
larger
and
some
are
equal
to
the
parts
of
the
sight
the
equal
particles
appear
transparent
the
larger
contract
and
the
lesser
dilate
the
sight
white
is
produced
by
the
dilation
black
by
the
contraction
of
the
particles
of
sight
there
is
also
a
swifter
motion
of
another
sort
of
fire
which
forces
a
way
through
the
passages
of
the
eyes
and
elicits
from
them
a
union
of
fire
and
water
which
we
call
tears
the
inner
fire
flashes
forth
and
the
outer
finds
a
way
in
and
is
extinguished
in
the
moisture
and
all
sorts
of
colours
are
generated
by
the
mixture
this
affection
is
termed
by
us
dazzling
and
the
object
which
produces
it
is
called
bright
there
is
yet
another
sort
of
fire
which
mingles
with
the
moisture
of
the
eye
without
flashing
and
produces
a
colour
like
blood
to
this
we
give
the
name
of
red
a
bright
element
mingling
with
red
and
white
produces
a
colour
which
we
call
auburn
the
law
of
proportion
however
according
to
which
compound
colours
are
formed
can
not
be
determined
scientifically
or
even
probably
red
when
mingled
with
black
and
white
gives
a
purple
hue
which
becomes
umber
when
the
colours
are
burnt
and
there
is
a
larger
admixture
of
black
is
a
mixture
of
auburn
and
dun
dun
of
white
and
black
yellow
of
white
and
auburn
white
and
bright
meeting
and
falling
upon
a
full
black
become
dark
blue
dark
blue
mingling
with
white
becomes
a
light
blue
the
union
of
and
black
makes
there
is
no
difficulty
in
seeing
how
other
colours
are
probably
composed
but
he
who
should
attempt
to
test
the
truth
of
this
by
experiment
would
forget
the
difference
of
the
human
and
divine
nature
god
only
is
able
to
compound
and
resolve
substances
such
experiments
are
impossible
to
man
these
are
the
elements
of
necessity
which
the
creator
received
in
the
world
of
generation
when
he
made
the
and
perfect
creature
using
the
secondary
causes
as
his
ministers
but
himself
fashioning
the
good
in
all
things
for
there
are
two
sorts
of
causes
the
one
divine
the
other
necessary
and
we
should
seek
to
discover
the
divine
above
all
and
for
their
sake
the
necessary
because
without
them
the
higher
can
not
be
attained
by
us
having
now
before
us
the
causes
out
of
which
the
rest
of
our
discourse
is
to
be
framed
let
us
go
back
to
the
point
at
which
we
began
and
add
a
fair
ending
to
our
tale
as
i
said
at
first
all
things
were
originally
a
chaos
in
which
there
was
no
order
or
proportion
the
elements
of
this
chaos
were
arranged
by
the
creator
and
out
of
them
he
made
the
world
of
the
divine
he
himself
was
the
author
but
he
committed
to
his
offspring
the
creation
of
the
mortal
from
him
they
received
the
immortal
soul
but
themselves
made
the
body
to
be
its
vehicle
and
constructed
within
another
soul
which
was
mortal
and
subject
to
terrible
affections
pleasure
the
inciter
of
evil
pain
which
deters
from
good
rashness
and
fear
foolish
counsellors
anger
hard
to
be
appeased
hope
easily
led
astray
these
they
mingled
with
irrational
sense
and
love
according
to
necessary
laws
and
so
framed
man
and
fearing
to
pollute
the
divine
element
they
gave
the
mortal
soul
a
separate
habitation
in
the
breast
parted
off
from
the
head
by
a
narrow
isthmus
and
as
in
a
house
the
women
apartments
are
divided
from
the
men
the
cavity
of
the
thorax
was
divided
into
two
parts
a
higher
and
a
lower
the
higher
of
the
two
which
is
the
seat
of
courage
and
anger
lies
nearer
to
the
head
between
the
midriff
and
the
neck
and
assists
reason
in
restraining
the
desires
the
heart
is
the
house
of
guard
in
which
all
the
veins
meet
and
through
them
reason
sends
her
commands
to
the
extremity
of
her
kingdom
when
the
passions
are
in
revolt
or
danger
approaches
from
without
then
the
heart
beats
and
swells
and
the
creating
powers
knowing
this
implanted
in
the
body
the
soft
and
bloodless
substance
of
the
lung
having
a
porous
and
springy
nature
like
a
sponge
and
being
kept
cool
by
drink
and
air
which
enters
through
the
trachea
the
part
of
the
soul
which
desires
meat
and
drink
was
placed
between
the
midriff
and
navel
where
they
made
a
sort
of
manger
and
here
they
bound
it
down
like
a
wild
animal
away
from
the
and
leaving
the
better
principle
undisturbed
to
advise
quietly
for
the
good
of
the
whole
for
the
creator
knew
that
the
belly
would
not
listen
to
reason
and
was
under
the
power
of
idols
and
fancies
wherefore
he
framed
the
liver
to
connect
with
the
lower
nature
contriving
that
it
should
be
compact
and
bright
and
sweet
and
also
bitter
and
smooth
in
order
that
the
power
of
thought
which
originates
in
the
mind
might
there
be
reflected
terrifying
the
belly
with
the
elements
of
bitterness
and
gall
and
a
suffusion
of
bilious
colours
when
the
liver
is
contracted
and
causing
pain
and
misery
by
twisting
out
of
its
place
the
lobe
and
closing
up
the
vessels
and
gates
and
the
converse
happens
when
some
gentle
inspiration
coming
from
intelligence
mirrors
the
opposite
fancies
giving
rest
and
sweetness
and
freedom
and
at
night
moderation
and
peace
accompanied
with
prophetic
insight
when
reason
and
sense
are
asleep
for
the
authors
of
our
being
in
obedience
to
their
will
and
in
order
to
make
men
as
good
as
they
could
gave
to
the
liver
the
power
of
divination
which
is
never
active
when
men
are
awake
or
in
health
but
when
they
are
under
the
influence
of
some
disorder
or
enthusiasm
then
they
receive
intimations
which
have
to
be
interpreted
by
others
who
are
called
prophets
but
should
rather
be
called
interpreters
of
prophecy
after
death
these
intimations
become
unintelligible
the
spleen
which
is
situated
in
the
neighbourhood
on
the
left
side
keeps
the
liver
bright
and
clean
as
a
napkin
does
a
mirror
and
the
evacuations
of
the
liver
are
received
into
it
and
being
a
hollow
tissue
it
is
for
a
time
swollen
with
these
impurities
but
when
the
body
is
purged
it
returns
to
its
natural
size
the
truth
concerning
the
soul
can
only
be
established
by
the
word
of
god
still
we
may
venture
to
assert
what
is
probable
both
concerning
soul
and
body
the
creative
powers
were
aware
of
our
tendency
to
excess
and
so
when
they
made
the
belly
to
be
a
receptacle
for
food
in
order
that
men
might
not
perish
by
insatiable
gluttony
they
formed
the
convolutions
of
the
intestines
in
this
way
retarding
the
passage
of
food
through
the
body
lest
mankind
should
be
absorbed
in
eating
and
drinking
and
the
whole
race
become
impervious
to
divine
philosophy
the
creation
of
bones
and
flesh
was
on
this
wise
the
foundation
of
these
is
the
marrow
which
binds
together
body
and
soul
and
the
marrow
is
made
out
of
such
of
the
primary
triangles
as
are
adapted
by
their
perfection
to
produce
all
the
four
elements
these
god
took
and
mingled
them
in
due
proportion
making
as
many
kinds
of
marrow
as
there
were
hereafter
to
be
kinds
of
souls
the
receptacle
of
the
divine
soul
he
made
round
and
called
that
portion
of
the
marrow
brain
intending
that
the
vessel
containing
this
substance
should
be
the
head
the
remaining
part
he
divided
into
long
and
round
figures
and
to
these
as
to
anchors
fastening
the
mortal
soul
he
proceeded
to
make
the
rest
of
the
body
first
forming
for
both
parts
a
covering
of
bone
the
bone
was
formed
by
sifting
pure
smooth
earth
and
wetting
it
with
marrow
it
was
then
thrust
alternately
into
fire
and
water
and
thus
rendered
insoluble
by
either
of
bone
he
made
a
globe
which
he
placed
around
the
brain
leaving
a
narrow
opening
and
around
the
marrow
of
the
neck
and
spine
he
formed
the
vertebrae
like
hinges
which
extended
from
the
head
through
the
whole
of
the
trunk
and
as
the
bone
was
brittle
and
liable
to
mortify
and
destroy
the
marrow
by
too
great
rigidity
and
susceptibility
to
heat
and
cold
he
contrived
sinews
and
flesh
the
first
to
give
flexibility
the
second
to
guard
against
heat
and
cold
and
to
be
a
protection
against
falls
containing
a
warm
moisture
which
in
summer
exudes
and
cools
the
body
and
in
winter
is
a
defence
against
cold
having
this
in
view
the
creator
mingled
earth
with
fire
and
water
and
mixed
with
them
a
ferment
of
acid
and
salt
so
as
to
form
pulpy
flesh
but
the
sinews
he
made
of
a
mixture
of
bone
and
unfermented
flesh
giving
them
a
mean
nature
between
the
two
and
a
yellow
colour
hence
they
were
more
glutinous
than
flesh
but
softer
than
bone
the
bones
which
have
most
of
the
living
soul
within
them
he
covered
with
the
thinnest
film
of
flesh
those
which
have
least
of
it
he
lodged
deeper
at
the
joints
he
diminished
the
flesh
in
order
not
to
impede
the
flexure
of
the
limbs
and
also
to
avoid
clogging
the
perceptions
of
the
mind
about
the
thighs
and
arms
which
have
no
sense
because
there
is
little
soul
in
the
marrow
and
about
the
inner
bones
he
laid
the
flesh
thicker
for
where
the
flesh
is
thicker
there
is
less
feeling
except
in
certain
parts
which
the
creator
has
made
solely
of
flesh
as
for
example
the
tongue
had
the
combination
of
solid
bone
and
thick
flesh
been
consistent
with
acute
perceptions
the
creator
would
have
given
man
a
sinewy
and
fleshy
head
and
then
he
would
have
lived
twice
as
long
but
our
creators
were
of
opinion
that
a
shorter
life
which
was
better
was
preferable
to
a
longer
which
was
worse
and
therefore
they
covered
the
head
with
thin
bone
and
placed
the
sinews
at
the
extremity
of
the
head
round
the
neck
and
fastened
the
jawbones
to
them
below
the
face
and
they
framed
the
mouth
having
teeth
and
tongue
and
lips
with
a
view
to
the
necessary
and
the
good
for
food
is
a
necessity
and
the
river
of
speech
is
the
best
of
rivers
still
the
head
could
not
be
left
a
bare
globe
of
bone
on
account
of
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
nor
be
allowed
to
become
dull
and
senseless
by
an
overgrowth
of
flesh
wherefore
it
was
covered
by
a
peel
or
skin
which
met
and
grew
by
the
help
of
the
cerebral
humour
the
diversity
of
the
sutures
was
caused
by
the
struggle
of
the
food
against
the
courses
of
the
soul
the
skin
of
the
head
was
pierced
by
fire
and
out
of
the
punctures
came
forth
a
moisture
part
liquid
and
part
of
a
skinny
nature
which
was
hardened
by
the
pressure
of
the
external
cold
and
became
hair
and
god
gave
hair
to
the
head
of
man
to
be
a
light
covering
so
that
it
might
not
interfere
with
his
perceptions
nails
were
formed
by
combining
sinew
skin
and
bone
and
were
made
by
the
creators
with
a
view
to
the
future
when
as
they
knew
women
and
other
animals
who
would
require
them
would
be
framed
out
of
man
the
gods
also
mingled
natures
akin
to
that
of
man
with
other
forms
and
perceptions
thus
trees
and
plants
were
created
which
were
originally
wild
and
have
been
adapted
by
cultivation
to
our
use
they
partake
of
that
third
kind
of
life
which
is
seated
between
the
midriff
and
the
navel
and
is
altogether
passive
and
incapable
of
reflection
when
the
creators
had
furnished
all
these
natures
for
our
sustenance
they
cut
channels
through
our
bodies
as
in
a
garden
watering
them
with
a
perennial
stream
two
were
cut
down
the
back
along
the
back
bone
where
the
skin
and
flesh
meet
one
on
the
right
and
the
other
on
the
left
having
the
marrow
of
generation
between
them
in
the
next
place
they
divided
the
veins
about
the
head
and
interlaced
them
with
each
other
in
order
that
they
might
form
an
additional
link
between
the
head
and
the
body
and
that
the
sensations
from
both
sides
might
be
diffused
throughout
the
body
in
the
third
place
they
contrived
the
passage
of
liquids
which
may
be
explained
in
this
way
finer
bodies
retain
coarser
but
not
the
coarser
the
finer
and
the
belly
is
capable
of
retaining
food
but
not
fire
and
air
god
therefore
formed
a
network
of
fire
and
air
to
irrigate
the
veins
having
within
it
two
lesser
nets
and
stretched
cords
reaching
from
both
the
lesser
nets
to
the
extremity
of
the
outer
net
the
inner
parts
of
the
net
were
made
by
him
of
fire
the
lesser
nets
and
their
cavities
of
air
the
two
latter
he
made
to
pass
into
the
mouth
the
one
ascending
by
the
from
the
lungs
the
other
by
the
side
of
the
from
the
belly
the
entrance
to
the
first
he
divided
into
two
parts
both
of
which
he
made
to
meet
at
the
channels
of
the
nose
that
when
the
mouth
was
closed
the
passage
connected
with
it
might
still
be
fed
with
air
the
cavity
of
the
network
he
spread
around
the
hollows
of
the
body
making
the
entire
receptacle
to
flow
into
and
out
of
the
lesser
nets
and
the
lesser
nets
into
and
out
of
it
while
the
outer
net
found
a
way
into
and
out
of
the
pores
of
the
body
and
the
internal
heat
followed
the
air
to
and
fro
these
as
we
affirm
are
the
phenomena
of
respiration
and
all
this
process
takes
place
in
order
that
the
body
may
be
watered
and
cooled
and
nourished
and
the
meat
and
drink
digested
and
liquefied
and
carried
into
the
veins
the
causes
of
respiration
have
now
to
be
considered
the
exhalation
of
the
breath
through
the
mouth
and
nostrils
displaces
the
external
air
and
at
the
same
time
leaves
a
vacuum
into
which
through
the
pores
the
air
which
is
displaced
enters
also
the
vacuum
which
is
made
when
the
air
is
exhaled
through
the
pores
is
filled
up
by
the
inhalation
of
breath
through
the
mouth
and
nostrils
the
explanation
of
this
double
phenomenon
is
as
follows
elements
move
towards
their
natural
places
now
as
every
animal
has
within
him
a
fountain
of
fire
the
air
which
is
inhaled
through
the
mouth
and
nostrils
on
coming
into
contact
with
this
is
heated
and
when
heated
in
accordance
with
the
law
of
attraction
it
escapes
by
the
way
it
entered
toward
the
place
of
fire
on
leaving
the
body
it
is
cooled
and
drives
round
the
air
which
it
displaces
through
the
pores
into
the
empty
lungs
this
again
is
in
turn
heated
by
the
internal
fire
and
escapes
as
it
entered
through
the
pores
the
phenomena
of
medical
of
swallowing
and
of
the
hurling
of
bodies
are
to
be
explained
on
a
similar
principle
as
also
sounds
which
are
sometimes
discordant
on
account
of
the
inequality
of
them
and
again
harmonious
by
reason
of
equality
the
slower
sounds
reaching
the
swifter
when
they
begin
to
pause
by
degrees
assimilate
with
them
whence
arises
a
pleasure
which
even
the
unwise
feel
and
which
to
the
wise
becomes
a
higher
sense
of
delight
being
an
imitation
of
divine
harmony
in
mortal
motions
streams
flow
lightnings
play
amber
and
the
magnet
attract
not
by
reason
of
attraction
but
because
abhors
a
vacuum
and
because
things
when
compounded
or
dissolved
move
different
ways
each
to
its
own
place
i
will
now
return
to
the
phenomena
of
respiration
the
fire
entering
the
belly
minces
the
food
and
as
it
escapes
fills
the
veins
by
drawing
after
it
the
divided
portions
and
thus
the
streams
of
nutriment
are
diffused
through
the
body
the
fruits
or
herbs
which
are
our
daily
sustenance
take
all
sorts
of
colours
when
intermixed
but
the
colour
of
red
or
fire
predominates
and
hence
the
liquid
which
we
call
blood
is
red
being
the
nurturing
principle
of
the
body
whence
all
parts
are
watered
and
empty
places
filled
the
process
of
repletion
and
depletion
is
produced
by
the
attraction
of
like
to
like
after
the
manner
of
the
universal
motion
the
external
elements
by
their
attraction
are
always
diminishing
the
substance
of
the
body
the
particles
of
blood
too
formed
out
of
the
newly
digested
food
are
attracted
towards
kindred
elements
within
the
body
and
so
fill
up
the
void
when
more
is
taken
away
than
flows
in
then
we
decay
and
when
less
we
grow
and
increase
the
young
of
every
animal
has
the
triangles
new
and
closely
locked
together
and
yet
the
entire
frame
is
soft
and
delicate
being
newly
made
of
marrow
and
nurtured
on
milk
these
triangles
are
sharper
than
those
which
enter
the
body
from
without
in
the
shape
of
food
and
therefore
they
cut
them
up
but
as
life
advances
the
triangles
wear
out
and
are
no
longer
able
to
assimilate
food
and
at
length
when
the
bonds
which
unite
the
triangles
of
the
marrow
become
undone
they
in
turn
unloose
the
bonds
of
the
soul
and
if
the
release
be
according
to
nature
she
then
flies
away
with
joy
for
the
death
which
is
natural
is
pleasant
but
that
which
is
caused
by
violence
is
painful
every
one
may
understand
the
origin
of
diseases
they
may
be
occasioned
by
the
disarrangement
or
disproportion
of
the
elements
out
of
which
the
body
is
framed
this
is
the
origin
of
many
of
them
but
the
worst
of
all
owe
their
severity
to
the
following
causes
there
is
a
natural
order
in
the
human
frame
according
to
which
the
flesh
and
sinews
are
made
of
blood
the
sinews
out
of
the
fibres
and
the
flesh
out
of
the
congealed
substance
which
is
formed
by
separation
from
the
fibres
the
glutinous
matter
which
comes
away
from
the
sinews
and
the
flesh
not
only
binds
the
flesh
to
the
bones
but
nourishes
the
bones
and
waters
the
marrow
when
these
processes
take
place
in
regular
order
the
body
is
in
health
but
when
the
flesh
wastes
and
returns
into
the
veins
there
is
discoloured
blood
as
well
as
air
in
the
veins
having
acid
and
salt
qualities
from
which
is
generated
every
sort
of
phlegm
and
bile
all
things
go
the
wrong
way
and
cease
to
give
nourishment
to
the
body
no
longer
preserving
their
natural
courses
but
at
war
with
themselves
and
destructive
to
the
constitution
of
the
body
the
oldest
part
of
the
flesh
which
is
hard
to
decompose
blackens
from
long
burning
and
from
being
corroded
grows
bitter
and
as
the
bitter
element
refines
away
becomes
acid
when
tinged
with
blood
the
bitter
substance
has
a
red
colour
and
this
when
mixed
with
black
takes
the
hue
of
grass
or
again
the
bitter
substance
has
an
auburn
colour
when
new
flesh
is
decomposed
by
the
internal
flame
to
all
which
phenomena
some
physician
or
philosopher
who
was
able
to
see
the
one
in
many
has
given
the
name
of
bile
the
various
kinds
of
bile
have
names
answering
to
their
colours
lymph
or
serum
is
of
two
kinds
first
the
whey
of
blood
which
is
gentle
secondly
the
secretion
of
dark
and
bitter
bile
which
when
mingled
under
the
influence
of
heat
with
salt
is
malignant
and
is
called
acid
phlegm
there
is
also
white
phlegm
formed
by
the
decomposition
of
young
and
tender
flesh
and
covered
with
little
bubbles
separately
invisible
but
becoming
visible
when
collected
the
water
of
tears
and
perspiration
and
similar
substances
is
also
the
watery
part
of
fresh
phlegm
all
these
humours
become
sources
of
disease
when
the
blood
is
replenished
in
irregular
ways
and
not
by
food
or
drink
the
danger
however
is
not
so
great
when
the
foundation
remains
for
then
there
is
a
possibility
of
recovery
but
when
the
substance
which
unites
the
flesh
and
bones
is
diseased
and
is
no
longer
renewed
from
the
muscles
and
sinews
and
instead
of
being
oily
and
smooth
and
glutinous
becomes
rough
and
salt
and
dry
then
the
fleshy
parts
fall
away
and
leave
the
sinews
bare
and
full
of
brine
and
the
flesh
gets
back
again
into
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
makes
the
previously
mentioned
disorders
still
greater
there
are
other
and
worse
diseases
which
are
prior
to
these
as
when
the
bone
through
the
density
of
the
flesh
does
not
receive
sufficient
air
and
becomes
stagnant
and
gangrened
and
crumbling
away
passes
into
the
food
and
the
food
into
the
flesh
and
the
flesh
returns
again
into
the
blood
worst
of
all
and
most
fatal
is
the
disease
of
the
marrow
by
which
the
whole
course
of
the
body
is
reversed
there
is
a
third
class
of
diseases
which
are
produced
some
by
wind
and
some
by
phlegm
and
some
by
bile
when
the
lung
which
is
the
steward
of
the
air
is
obstructed
by
rheums
and
in
one
part
no
air
and
in
another
too
much
enters
in
then
the
parts
which
are
unrefreshed
by
air
corrode
and
other
parts
are
distorted
by
the
excess
of
air
and
in
this
manner
painful
diseases
are
produced
the
most
painful
are
caused
by
wind
generated
within
the
body
which
gets
about
the
great
sinews
of
the
shoulders
these
are
termed
tetanus
the
cure
of
them
is
difficult
and
in
most
cases
they
are
relieved
only
by
fever
white
phlegm
which
is
dangerous
if
kept
in
by
reason
of
the
air
bubbles
is
not
equally
dangerous
if
able
to
escape
through
the
pores
although
it
variegates
the
body
generating
diverse
kinds
of
leprosies
if
when
mingled
with
black
bile
it
disturbs
the
courses
of
the
head
in
sleep
there
is
not
so
much
danger
but
if
it
assails
those
who
are
awake
then
the
attack
is
far
more
dangerous
and
is
called
epilepsy
or
the
sacred
disease
acid
and
salt
phlegm
is
the
source
of
catarrh
inflammations
originate
in
bile
which
is
sometimes
relieved
by
boils
and
swellings
but
when
detained
and
above
all
when
mingled
with
pure
blood
generates
many
inflammatory
disorders
disturbing
the
position
of
the
fibres
which
are
scattered
about
in
the
blood
in
order
to
maintain
the
balance
of
rare
and
dense
which
is
necessary
to
its
regular
circulation
if
the
bile
which
is
only
stale
blood
or
liquefied
flesh
comes
in
little
by
little
it
is
congealed
by
the
fibres
and
produces
internal
cold
and
shuddering
but
when
it
enters
with
more
of
a
flood
it
overcomes
the
fibres
by
its
heat
and
reaches
the
spinal
marrow
and
burning
up
the
cables
of
the
soul
sets
her
free
from
the
body
when
on
the
other
hand
the
body
though
wasted
still
holds
out
then
the
bile
is
expelled
like
an
exile
from
a
factious
state
causing
associating
diarrhoeas
and
dysenteries
and
similar
disorders
the
body
which
is
diseased
from
the
effects
of
fire
is
in
a
continual
fever
when
air
is
the
agent
the
fever
is
quotidian
when
water
the
fever
intermits
a
day
when
earth
which
is
the
most
sluggish
element
the
fever
intermits
three
days
and
is
with
difficulty
shaken
off
of
mental
disorders
there
are
two
sorts
one
madness
the
other
ignorance
and
they
may
be
justly
attributed
to
disease
excessive
pleasures
or
pains
are
among
the
greatest
diseases
and
deprive
men
of
their
senses
when
the
seed
about
the
spinal
marrow
is
too
abundant
the
body
has
too
great
pleasures
and
pains
and
during
a
great
part
of
his
life
he
who
is
the
subject
of
them
is
more
or
less
mad
he
is
often
thought
bad
but
this
is
a
mistake
for
the
truth
is
that
the
intemperance
of
lust
is
due
to
the
fluidity
of
the
marrow
produced
by
the
loose
consistency
of
the
bones
and
this
is
true
of
vice
in
general
which
is
commonly
regarded
as
disgraceful
whereas
it
is
really
involuntary
and
arises
from
a
bad
habit
of
the
body
and
evil
education
in
like
manner
the
soul
is
often
made
vicious
by
the
influence
of
bodily
pain
the
briny
phlegm
and
other
bitter
and
bilious
humours
wander
over
the
body
and
find
no
exit
but
are
compressed
within
and
mingle
their
own
vapours
with
the
motions
of
the
soul
and
are
carried
to
the
three
places
of
the
soul
creating
infinite
varieties
of
trouble
and
melancholy
of
rashness
and
cowardice
of
forgetfulness
and
stupidity
when
men
are
in
this
evil
plight
of
body
and
evil
forms
of
government
and
evil
discourses
are
superadded
and
there
is
no
education
to
save
them
they
are
corrupted
through
two
causes
but
of
neither
of
them
are
they
really
the
authors
for
the
planters
are
to
blame
rather
than
the
plants
the
educators
and
not
the
educated
still
we
should
endeavour
to
attain
virtue
and
avoid
vice
but
this
is
part
of
another
subject
enough
of
disease
i
have
now
to
speak
of
the
means
by
which
the
mind
and
body
are
to
be
preserved
a
higher
theme
than
the
other
the
good
is
the
beautiful
and
the
beautiful
is
the
symmetrical
and
there
is
no
greater
or
fairer
symmetry
than
that
of
body
and
soul
as
the
contrary
is
the
greatest
of
deformities
a
leg
or
an
arm
too
long
or
too
short
is
at
once
ugly
and
unserviceable
and
the
same
is
true
if
body
and
soul
are
disproportionate
for
a
strong
and
impassioned
soul
may
the
pigmy
body
to
decay
and
so
produce
convulsions
and
other
evils
the
violence
of
controversy
or
the
earnestness
of
enquiry
will
often
generate
inflammations
and
rheums
which
are
not
understood
or
assigned
to
their
true
cause
by
the
professors
of
medicine
and
in
like
manner
the
body
may
be
too
much
for
the
soul
darkening
the
reason
and
quickening
the
animal
desires
the
only
security
is
to
preserve
the
balance
of
the
two
and
to
this
end
the
mathematician
or
philosopher
must
practise
gymnastics
and
the
gymnast
must
cultivate
music
the
parts
of
the
body
too
must
be
treated
in
the
same
way
they
should
receive
their
appropriate
exercise
for
the
body
is
set
in
motion
when
it
is
heated
and
cooled
by
the
elements
which
enter
in
or
is
dried
up
and
moistened
by
external
things
and
if
given
up
to
these
processes
when
at
rest
it
is
liable
to
destruction
but
the
natural
motion
as
in
the
world
so
also
in
the
human
frame
produces
harmony
and
divides
hostile
powers
the
best
exercise
is
the
spontaneous
motion
of
the
body
as
in
gymnastics
because
most
akin
to
the
motion
of
mind
not
so
good
is
the
motion
of
which
the
source
is
in
another
as
in
sailing
or
riding
least
good
when
the
body
is
at
rest
and
the
motion
is
in
parts
only
which
is
a
species
of
motion
imparted
by
physic
this
should
only
be
resorted
to
by
men
of
sense
in
extreme
cases
lesser
diseases
are
not
to
be
irritated
by
medicine
for
every
disease
is
akin
to
the
living
being
and
has
an
appointed
term
just
as
life
has
which
depends
on
the
form
of
the
triangles
and
can
not
be
protracted
when
they
are
worn
out
and
he
who
instead
of
accepting
his
destiny
endeavours
to
prolong
his
life
by
medicine
is
likely
to
multiply
and
magnify
his
diseases
regimen
and
not
medicine
is
the
true
cure
when
a
man
has
time
at
his
disposal
enough
of
the
nature
of
man
and
of
the
body
and
of
training
and
education
the
subject
is
a
great
one
and
can
not
be
adequately
treated
as
an
appendage
to
another
to
sum
up
all
in
a
word
there
are
three
kinds
of
soul
located
within
us
and
any
one
of
them
if
remaining
inactive
becomes
very
weak
if
exercised
very
strong
wherefore
we
should
duly
train
and
exercise
all
three
kinds
the
divine
soul
god
lodged
in
the
head
to
raise
us
like
plants
which
are
not
of
earthly
origin
to
our
kindred
for
the
head
is
nearest
to
heaven
he
who
is
intent
upon
the
gratification
of
his
desires
and
cherishes
the
mortal
soul
has
all
his
ideas
mortal
and
is
himself
mortal
in
the
truest
sense
but
he
who
seeks
after
knowledge
and
exercises
the
divine
part
of
himself
in
godly
and
immortal
thoughts
attains
to
truth
and
immortality
as
far
as
is
possible
to
man
and
also
to
happiness
while
he
is
training
up
within
him
the
divine
principle
and
indwelling
power
of
order
there
is
only
one
way
in
which
one
person
can
benefit
another
and
that
is
by
assigning
to
him
his
proper
nurture
and
motion
to
the
motions
of
the
soul
answer
the
motions
of
the
universe
and
by
the
study
of
these
the
individual
is
restored
to
his
original
nature
thus
we
have
finished
the
discussion
of
the
universe
which
according
to
our
original
intention
has
now
been
brought
down
to
the
creation
of
man
completeness
seems
to
require
that
something
should
be
briefly
said
about
other
animals
first
of
women
who
are
probably
degenerate
and
cowardly
men
and
when
they
degenerated
the
gods
implanted
in
men
the
desire
of
union
with
them
creating
in
man
one
animate
substance
and
in
woman
another
in
the
following
manner
the
outlet
for
liquids
they
connected
with
the
living
principle
of
the
spinal
marrow
which
the
man
has
the
desire
to
emit
into
the
fruitful
womb
of
the
woman
this
is
like
a
fertile
field
in
which
the
seed
is
quickened
and
matured
and
at
last
brought
to
light
when
this
desire
is
unsatisfied
the
man
is
by
the
power
of
the
generative
organs
and
the
woman
is
subjected
to
disorders
from
the
obstruction
of
the
passages
of
the
breath
until
the
two
meet
and
pluck
the
fruit
of
the
tree
the
race
of
birds
was
created
out
of
innocent
men
who
thought
to
pursue
the
study
of
the
heavens
by
sight
these
were
transformed
into
birds
and
grew
feathers
instead
of
hair
the
race
of
wild
animals
were
men
who
had
no
philosophy
and
never
looked
up
to
heaven
or
used
the
courses
of
the
head
but
followed
only
the
influences
of
passion
naturally
they
turned
to
their
kindred
earth
and
put
their
forelegs
to
the
ground
and
their
heads
were
crushed
into
strange
oblong
forms
some
of
them
have
four
feet
and
some
of
them
more
than
four
the
latter
who
are
the
more
senseless
drawing
closer
to
their
native
element
the
most
senseless
of
all
have
no
limbs
and
trail
their
whole
body
on
the
ground
the
fourth
kind
are
the
inhabitants
of
the
waters
these
are
made
out
of
the
most
senseless
and
ignorant
and
impure
of
men
whom
god
placed
in
the
uttermost
parts
of
the
world
in
return
for
their
utter
ignorance
and
caused
them
to
respire
water
instead
of
the
pure
element
of
air
such
are
the
laws
by
which
animals
pass
into
one
another
and
so
the
world
received
animals
mortal
and
immortal
and
was
fulfilled
with
them
and
became
a
visible
god
comprehending
the
visible
made
in
the
image
of
the
intellectual
being
the
one
perfect
heaven
section
nature
in
the
aspect
which
she
presented
to
a
greek
philosopher
of
the
fourth
century
before
christ
is
not
easily
reproduced
to
modern
eyes
the
associations
of
mythology
and
poetry
have
to
be
added
and
the
unconscious
influence
of
science
has
to
be
subtracted
before
we
can
behold
the
heavens
or
the
earth
as
they
appeared
to
the
greek
the
philosopher
himself
was
a
child
and
also
a
man
a
child
in
the
range
of
his
attainments
but
also
a
great
intelligence
having
an
insight
into
nature
and
often
anticipations
of
the
truth
he
was
full
of
original
thoughts
and
yet
liable
to
be
imposed
upon
by
the
most
obvious
fallacies
he
occasionally
confused
numbers
with
ideas
and
atoms
with
numbers
his
a
priori
notions
were
out
of
all
proportion
to
his
experience
he
was
ready
to
explain
the
phenomena
of
the
heavens
by
the
most
trivial
analogies
of
earth
the
experiments
which
nature
worked
for
him
he
sometimes
accepted
but
he
never
tried
experiments
for
himself
which
would
either
prove
or
disprove
his
theories
his
knowledge
was
unequal
while
in
some
branches
such
as
medicine
and
astronomy
he
had
made
considerable
proficiency
there
were
others
such
as
chemistry
electricity
mechanics
of
which
the
very
names
were
unknown
to
him
he
was
the
natural
enemy
of
mythology
and
yet
mythological
ideas
still
retained
their
hold
over
him
he
was
endeavouring
to
form
a
conception
of
principles
but
these
principles
or
ideas
were
regarded
by
him
as
real
powers
or
entities
to
which
the
world
had
been
subjected
he
was
always
tending
to
argue
from
what
was
near
to
what
was
remote
from
what
was
known
to
what
was
unknown
from
man
to
the
universe
and
back
again
from
the
universe
to
man
while
he
was
arranging
the
world
he
was
arranging
the
forms
of
thought
in
his
own
mind
and
the
light
from
within
and
the
light
from
without
often
crossed
and
helped
to
confuse
one
another
he
might
be
compared
to
a
builder
engaged
in
some
great
design
who
could
only
dig
with
his
hands
because
he
was
unprovided
with
common
tools
or
to
some
poet
or
musician
like
tynnichus
ion
obliged
to
accommodate
his
lyric
raptures
to
the
limits
of
the
tetrachord
or
of
the
flute
the
hesiodic
and
orphic
cosmogonies
were
a
phase
of
thought
intermediate
between
mythology
and
philosophy
and
had
a
great
influence
on
the
beginnings
of
knowledge
there
was
nothing
behind
them
they
were
to
physical
science
what
the
poems
of
homer
were
to
early
greek
history
they
made
men
think
of
the
world
as
a
whole
they
carried
the
mind
back
into
the
infinity
of
past
time
they
suggested
the
first
observation
of
the
effects
of
fire
and
water
on
the
earth
surface
to
the
ancient
physics
they
stood
much
in
the
same
relation
which
geology
does
to
modern
science
but
the
greek
was
not
like
the
enquirer
of
the
last
generation
confined
to
a
period
of
six
thousand
years
he
was
able
to
speculate
freely
on
the
effects
of
infinite
ages
in
the
production
of
physical
phenomena
he
could
imagine
cities
which
had
existed
time
out
of
mind
states
laws
laws
or
forms
of
art
and
music
which
had
lasted
in
word
only
but
in
very
truth
for
ten
thousand
laws
he
was
aware
that
natural
phenomena
like
the
delta
of
the
nile
might
have
slowly
accumulated
in
long
periods
of
time
but
he
seems
to
have
supposed
that
the
course
of
events
was
recurring
rather
than
progressive
to
this
he
was
probably
led
by
the
fixedness
of
egyptian
customs
and
the
general
observation
that
there
were
other
civilisations
in
the
world
more
ancient
than
that
of
hellas
the
ancient
philosophers
found
in
mythology
many
ideas
which
if
not
originally
derived
from
nature
were
easily
transferred
to
her
such
for
example
as
love
or
hate
corresponding
to
attraction
or
repulsion
or
the
conception
of
necessity
allied
both
to
the
regularity
and
irregularity
of
nature
or
of
chance
the
nameless
or
unknown
cause
or
of
justice
symbolizing
the
law
of
compensation
are
of
the
fates
and
furies
typifying
the
fixed
order
or
the
extraordinary
convulsions
of
nature
their
own
interpretations
of
homer
and
the
poets
were
supposed
by
them
to
be
the
original
meaning
musing
in
themselves
on
the
phenomena
of
nature
they
were
relieved
at
being
able
to
utter
the
thoughts
of
their
hearts
in
figures
of
speech
which
to
them
were
not
figures
and
were
already
consecrated
by
tradition
hesiod
and
the
orphic
poets
moved
in
a
region
of
in
which
the
meaning
or
principle
appeared
through
the
person
in
their
vaster
conceptions
of
chaos
erebus
aether
night
and
the
like
the
first
rude
attempts
at
generalization
are
dimly
seen
the
gods
themselves
especially
the
greater
gods
such
as
zeus
poseidon
apollo
athene
are
universals
as
well
as
individuals
they
were
gradually
becoming
lost
in
a
common
conception
of
mind
or
god
they
continued
to
exist
for
the
purposes
of
ritual
or
of
art
but
from
the
sixth
century
onwards
or
even
earlier
there
arose
and
gained
strength
in
the
minds
of
men
the
notion
of
god
greatest
among
gods
and
men
who
was
all
sight
all
hearing
all
knowing
xenophanes
under
the
influence
of
such
ideas
perhaps
also
deriving
from
the
traditions
of
their
own
or
of
other
nations
scraps
of
medicine
and
astronomy
men
came
to
the
observation
of
nature
the
greek
philosopher
looked
at
the
blue
circle
of
the
heavens
and
it
flashed
upon
him
that
all
things
were
one
the
tumult
of
sense
abated
and
the
mind
found
repose
in
the
thought
which
former
generations
had
been
striving
to
realize
the
first
expression
of
this
was
some
element
rarefied
by
degrees
into
a
pure
abstraction
and
purged
from
any
tincture
of
sense
soon
an
inner
world
of
ideas
began
to
be
unfolded
more
absorbing
more
overpowering
more
abiding
than
the
brightest
of
visible
objects
which
to
the
eye
of
the
philosopher
looking
inward
seemed
to
pale
before
them
retaining
only
a
faint
and
precarious
existence
at
the
same
time
the
minds
of
men
parted
into
the
two
great
divisions
of
those
who
saw
only
a
principle
of
motion
and
of
those
who
saw
only
a
principle
of
rest
in
nature
and
in
themselves
there
were
born
heracliteans
or
eleatics
as
there
have
been
in
later
ages
born
aristotelians
or
platonists
like
some
philosophers
in
modern
times
who
are
accused
of
making
a
theory
first
and
finding
their
facts
afterwards
the
advocates
of
either
opinion
never
thought
of
applying
either
to
themselves
or
to
their
adversaries
the
criterion
of
fact
they
were
mastered
by
their
ideas
and
not
masters
of
them
like
the
heraclitean
fanatics
whom
plato
has
ridiculed
in
the
theaetetus
they
were
incapable
of
giving
a
reason
of
the
faith
that
was
in
them
and
had
all
the
animosities
of
a
religious
sect
yet
doubtless
there
was
some
first
impression
derived
from
external
nature
which
as
in
mythology
so
also
in
philosophy
worked
upon
the
minds
of
the
first
thinkers
though
incapable
of
induction
or
generalization
in
the
modern
sense
they
caught
an
inspiration
from
the
external
world
the
most
general
facts
or
appearances
of
nature
the
circle
of
the
universe
the
nutritive
power
of
water
the
air
which
is
the
breath
of
life
the
destructive
force
of
fire
the
seeming
regularity
of
the
greater
part
of
nature
and
the
irregularity
of
a
remnant
the
recurrence
of
day
and
night
and
of
the
seasons
the
solid
earth
and
the
impalpable
aether
were
always
present
to
them
the
great
source
of
error
and
also
the
beginning
of
truth
to
them
was
reasoning
from
analogy
they
could
see
resemblances
but
not
differences
and
they
were
incapable
of
distinguishing
illustration
from
argument
analogy
in
modern
times
only
points
the
way
and
is
immediately
verified
by
experiment
the
dreams
and
visions
which
pass
through
the
philosopher
mind
of
resemblances
between
different
classes
of
substances
or
between
the
animal
and
vegetable
world
are
put
into
the
refiner
fire
and
the
dross
and
other
elements
which
adhere
to
them
are
purged
away
but
the
contemporary
of
plato
and
socrates
was
incapable
of
resisting
the
power
of
any
analogy
which
occurred
to
him
and
was
drawn
into
any
consequences
which
seemed
to
follow
he
had
no
methods
of
difference
or
of
concomitant
variations
by
the
use
of
which
he
could
distinguish
the
accidental
from
the
essential
he
could
not
isolate
phenomena
and
he
was
helpless
against
the
influence
of
any
word
which
had
an
equivocal
or
double
sense
yet
without
this
crude
use
of
analogy
the
ancient
physical
philosopher
would
have
stood
still
he
could
not
have
made
even
guess
among
many
without
comparison
the
course
of
natural
phenomena
would
have
passed
unheeded
before
his
eyes
like
fair
sights
or
musical
sounds
before
the
eyes
and
ears
of
an
animal
even
the
fetichism
of
the
savage
is
the
beginning
of
reasoning
the
assumption
of
the
most
fanciful
of
causes
indicates
a
higher
mental
state
than
the
absence
of
all
enquiry
about
them
the
tendency
to
argue
from
the
higher
to
the
lower
from
man
to
the
world
has
led
to
many
errors
but
has
also
had
an
elevating
influence
on
philosophy
the
conception
of
the
world
as
a
whole
a
person
an
animal
has
been
the
source
of
hasty
generalizations
yet
this
general
grasp
of
nature
led
also
to
a
spirit
of
comprehensiveness
in
early
philosophy
which
has
not
increased
but
rather
diminished
as
the
fields
of
knowledge
have
become
more
divided
the
modern
physicist
confines
himself
to
one
or
perhaps
two
branches
of
science
but
he
comparatively
seldom
rises
above
his
own
department
and
often
falls
under
the
narrowing
influence
which
any
single
branch
when
pursued
to
the
exclusion
of
every
other
has
over
the
mind
language
two
exercised
a
spell
over
the
beginnings
of
physical
philosophy
leading
to
error
and
sometimes
to
truth
for
many
thoughts
were
suggested
by
the
double
meanings
of
words
greek
and
the
accidental
distinctions
of
words
sometimes
led
the
ancient
philosopher
to
make
corresponding
differences
in
things
greek
they
are
the
same
why
have
they
different
names
or
if
they
are
different
why
have
they
the
same
name
is
an
argument
not
easily
answered
in
the
infancy
of
knowledge
the
modern
philosopher
has
always
been
taught
the
lesson
which
he
still
imperfectly
learns
that
he
must
disengage
himself
from
the
influence
of
words
nor
are
there
wanting
in
plato
who
was
himself
too
often
the
victim
of
them
impressive
admonitions
that
we
should
regard
not
words
but
things
but
upon
the
whole
the
ancients
though
not
entirely
dominated
by
them
were
much
more
subject
to
the
influence
of
words
than
the
moderns
they
had
no
clear
divisions
of
colours
or
substances
even
the
four
elements
were
undefined
the
fields
of
knowledge
were
not
parted
off
they
were
bringing
order
out
of
disorder
having
a
small
grain
of
experience
mingled
in
a
confused
heap
of
a
priori
notions
and
yet
probably
their
first
impressions
the
illusions
and
mirages
of
their
fancy
created
a
greater
intellectual
activity
and
made
a
nearer
approach
to
the
truth
than
any
patient
investigation
of
isolated
facts
for
which
the
time
had
not
yet
come
could
have
accomplished
there
was
one
more
illusion
to
which
the
ancient
philosophers
were
subject
and
against
which
plato
in
his
later
dialogues
seems
to
be
struggling
the
tendency
to
mere
abstractions
not
perceiving
that
pure
abstraction
is
only
negation
they
thought
that
the
greater
the
abstraction
the
greater
the
truth
behind
any
pair
of
ideas
a
new
idea
which
comprehended
them
the
greek
as
it
was
technically
termed
began
at
once
to
appear
two
are
truer
than
three
one
than
two
the
words
or
or
essence
or
became
sacred
to
them
they
did
not
see
that
they
had
a
word
only
and
in
one
sense
the
most
unmeaning
of
words
they
did
not
understand
that
the
content
of
notions
is
in
inverse
proportion
to
their
universality
the
element
which
is
the
most
widely
diffused
is
also
the
thinnest
or
in
the
language
of
the
common
logic
the
greater
the
extension
the
less
the
comprehension
but
this
vacant
idea
of
a
whole
without
parts
of
a
subject
without
predicates
a
rest
without
motion
has
been
also
the
most
fruitful
of
all
ideas
it
is
the
beginning
of
a
priori
thought
and
indeed
of
thinking
at
all
men
were
led
to
conceive
it
not
by
a
love
of
hasty
generalization
but
by
a
divine
instinct
a
dialectical
enthusiasm
in
which
the
human
faculties
seemed
to
yearn
for
enlargement
we
know
that
is
only
the
verb
of
existence
the
copula
the
most
general
symbol
of
relation
the
first
and
most
meagre
of
abstractions
but
to
some
of
the
ancient
philosophers
this
little
word
appeared
to
attain
divine
proportions
and
to
comprehend
all
truth
being
or
essence
and
similar
words
represented
to
them
a
supreme
or
divine
being
in
which
they
thought
that
they
found
the
containing
and
continuing
principle
of
the
universe
in
a
few
years
the
human
mind
was
peopled
with
abstractions
a
new
world
was
called
into
existence
to
give
law
and
order
to
the
old
but
between
them
there
was
still
a
gulf
and
no
one
could
pass
from
the
one
to
the
other
number
and
figure
were
the
greatest
instruments
of
thought
which
were
possessed
by
the
greek
philosopher
having
the
same
power
over
the
mind
which
was
exerted
by
abstract
ideas
they
were
also
capable
of
practical
application
many
curious
and
to
the
early
thinker
mysterious
properties
of
them
came
to
light
when
they
were
compared
with
one
another
they
admitted
of
infinite
multiplication
and
construction
in
pythagorean
triangles
or
in
proportions
of
and
or
compounds
of
them
the
laws
of
the
world
seemed
to
be
more
than
half
revealed
they
were
also
capable
of
infinite
subdivision
a
wonder
and
also
a
puzzle
to
the
ancient
thinker
they
were
not
like
being
or
essence
mere
vacant
abstractions
but
admitted
of
progress
and
growth
while
at
the
same
time
they
confirmed
a
higher
sentiment
of
the
mind
that
there
was
order
in
the
universe
and
so
there
began
to
be
a
real
sympathy
between
the
world
within
and
the
world
without
the
numbers
and
figures
which
were
present
to
the
mind
eye
became
visible
to
the
eye
of
sense
the
truth
of
nature
was
mathematics
the
other
properties
of
objects
seemed
to
reappear
only
in
the
light
of
number
law
and
morality
also
found
a
natural
expression
in
number
and
figure
instruments
of
such
power
and
elasticity
could
not
fail
to
be
most
gracious
assistance
to
the
first
efforts
of
human
intelligence
there
was
another
reason
why
numbers
had
so
great
an
influence
over
the
minds
of
early
thinkers
they
were
verified
by
experience
every
use
of
them
even
the
most
trivial
assured
men
of
their
truth
they
were
everywhere
to
be
found
in
the
least
things
and
the
greatest
alike
one
two
three
counted
on
the
fingers
was
a
matter
a
little
instrument
out
of
which
to
create
a
world
but
from
these
and
by
the
help
of
these
all
our
knowledge
of
nature
has
been
developed
they
were
the
measure
of
all
things
and
seemed
to
give
law
to
all
things
nature
was
rescued
from
chaos
and
confusion
by
their
power
the
notes
of
music
the
motions
of
the
stars
the
forms
of
atoms
the
evolution
and
recurrence
of
days
months
years
the
military
divisions
of
an
army
the
civil
divisions
of
a
state
seemed
to
afford
a
of
them
what
would
have
become
of
man
or
of
the
world
if
deprived
of
number
the
mystery
of
number
and
the
mystery
of
music
were
akin
there
was
a
music
of
rhythm
and
of
harmonious
motion
everywhere
and
to
the
real
connexion
which
existed
between
music
and
number
a
fanciful
or
imaginary
relation
was
superadded
there
was
a
music
of
the
spheres
as
well
as
of
the
notes
of
the
lyre
if
in
all
things
seen
there
was
number
and
figure
why
should
they
not
also
pervade
the
unseen
world
with
which
by
their
wonderful
and
unchangeable
nature
they
seemed
to
hold
communion
two
other
points
strike
us
in
the
use
which
the
ancient
philosophers
made
of
numbers
first
they
applied
to
external
nature
the
relations
of
them
which
they
found
in
their
own
minds
and
where
nature
seemed
to
be
at
variance
with
number
as
for
example
in
the
case
of
fractions
they
protested
against
her
arist
having
long
meditated
on
the
properties
of
or
or
of
they
discovered
in
them
many
curious
correspondences
and
were
disposed
to
find
in
them
the
secret
of
the
universe
secondly
they
applied
number
and
figure
equally
to
those
parts
of
physics
such
as
astronomy
or
mechanics
in
which
the
modern
philosopher
expects
to
find
them
and
to
those
in
which
he
would
never
think
of
looking
for
them
such
as
physiology
and
psychology
for
the
sciences
were
not
yet
divided
and
there
was
nothing
really
irrational
in
arguing
that
the
same
laws
which
regulated
the
heavenly
bodies
were
partially
applied
to
the
erring
limbs
or
brain
of
man
astrology
was
the
form
which
the
lively
fancy
of
ancient
thinkers
almost
necessarily
gave
to
astronomy
the
observation
that
the
lower
principle
mechanics
is
always
seen
in
the
higher
in
the
phenomena
of
life
further
tended
to
perplex
them
plato
doctrine
of
the
same
and
the
other
ruling
the
courses
of
the
heavens
and
of
the
human
body
is
not
a
mere
vagary
but
is
a
natural
result
of
the
state
of
knowledge
and
thought
at
which
he
had
arrived
when
in
modern
times
we
contemplate
the
heavens
a
certain
amount
of
scientific
truth
imperceptibly
blends
even
with
the
cursory
glance
of
an
unscientific
person
he
knows
that
the
earth
is
revolving
round
the
sun
and
not
the
sun
around
the
earth
he
does
not
imagine
the
earth
to
be
the
centre
of
the
universe
and
he
has
some
conception
of
chemistry
and
the
cognate
sciences
a
very
different
aspect
of
nature
would
have
been
present
to
the
mind
of
the
early
greek
philosopher
he
would
have
beheld
the
earth
a
surface
only
not
mirrored
however
faintly
in
the
glass
of
science
but
indissolubly
connected
with
some
theory
of
one
two
or
more
elements
he
would
have
seen
the
world
pervaded
by
number
and
figure
animated
by
a
principle
of
motion
immanent
in
a
principle
of
rest
he
would
have
tried
to
construct
the
universe
on
a
quantitative
principle
seeming
to
find
in
endless
combinations
of
geometrical
figures
or
in
the
infinite
variety
of
their
sizes
a
sufficient
account
of
the
multiplicity
of
phenomena
to
these
a
priori
speculations
he
would
add
a
rude
conception
of
matter
and
his
own
immediate
experience
of
health
and
disease
his
cosmos
would
necessarily
be
imperfect
and
unequal
being
the
first
attempt
to
impress
form
and
order
on
the
primaeval
chaos
of
human
knowledge
he
would
see
all
things
as
in
a
dream
the
ancient
physical
philosophers
have
been
charged
by
whewell
and
others
with
wasting
their
fine
intelligences
in
wrong
methods
of
enquiry
and
their
progress
in
moral
and
political
philosophy
has
been
sometimes
contrasted
with
their
supposed
failure
in
physical
investigations
had
plenty
of
ideas
says
whewell
plenty
of
facts
but
their
ideas
did
not
accurately
represent
the
facts
with
which
they
were
acquainted
this
is
a
very
crude
and
misleading
way
of
describing
ancient
science
it
is
the
mistake
of
an
uneducated
person
uneducated
that
is
in
the
higher
sense
of
the
word
who
imagines
every
one
else
to
be
like
himself
and
explains
every
other
age
by
his
own
no
doubt
the
ancients
often
fell
into
strange
and
fanciful
errors
the
time
had
not
yet
arrived
for
the
slower
and
surer
path
of
the
modern
inductive
philosophy
but
it
remains
to
be
shown
that
they
could
have
done
more
in
their
age
and
country
or
that
the
contributions
which
they
made
to
the
sciences
with
which
they
were
acquainted
are
not
as
great
upon
the
whole
as
those
made
by
their
successors
there
is
no
single
step
in
astronomy
as
great
as
that
of
the
nameless
pythagorean
who
first
conceived
the
world
to
be
a
body
moving
round
the
sun
in
space
there
is
no
truer
or
more
comprehensive
principle
than
the
application
of
mathematics
alike
to
the
heavenly
bodies
and
to
the
particles
of
matter
the
ancients
had
not
the
instruments
which
would
have
enabled
them
to
correct
or
verify
their
anticipations
and
their
opportunities
of
observation
were
limited
plato
probably
did
more
for
physical
science
by
asserting
the
supremacy
of
mathematics
than
aristotle
or
his
disciples
by
their
collections
of
facts
when
the
thinkers
of
modern
times
following
bacon
undervalue
or
disparage
the
speculations
of
ancient
philosophers
they
seem
wholly
to
forget
the
conditions
of
the
world
and
of
the
human
mind
under
which
they
carried
on
their
investigations
when
we
accuse
them
of
being
under
the
influence
of
words
do
we
suppose
that
we
are
altogether
free
from
this
illusion
when
we
remark
that
greek
physics
soon
became
stationary
or
extinct
may
we
not
observe
also
that
there
have
been
and
may
be
again
periods
in
the
history
of
modern
philosophy
which
have
been
barren
and
unproductive
we
might
as
well
maintain
that
greek
art
was
not
real
or
great
because
it
had
nihil
simile
aut
secundum
as
say
that
greek
physics
were
a
failure
because
they
admire
no
subsequent
progress
the
charge
of
premature
generalization
which
is
often
urged
against
ancient
philosophers
is
really
an
anachronism
for
they
can
hardly
be
said
to
have
generalized
at
all
they
may
be
said
more
truly
to
have
cleared
up
and
defined
by
the
help
of
experience
ideas
which
they
already
possessed
the
beginnings
of
thought
about
nature
must
always
have
this
character
a
true
method
is
the
result
of
many
ages
of
experiment
and
observation
and
is
ever
going
on
and
enlarging
with
the
progress
of
science
and
knowledge
at
first
men
personify
nature
then
they
form
impressions
of
nature
at
last
they
conceive
or
laws
of
nature
they
pass
out
of
mythology
into
philosophy
early
science
is
not
a
process
of
discovery
in
the
modern
sense
but
rather
a
process
of
correcting
by
observation
and
to
a
certain
extent
only
the
first
impressions
of
nature
which
mankind
when
they
began
to
think
had
received
from
poetry
or
language
or
unintelligent
sense
of
all
scientific
truths
the
greatest
and
simplest
is
the
uniformity
of
nature
this
was
expressed
by
the
ancients
in
many
ways
as
fate
or
necessity
or
measure
or
limit
unexpected
events
of
which
the
cause
was
unknown
to
them
they
attributed
to
chance
but
their
conception
of
nature
was
never
that
of
law
interrupted
by
exceptions
a
somewhat
unfortunate
metaphysical
invention
of
modern
times
which
is
at
variance
with
facts
and
has
failed
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
thought
section
plato
account
of
the
soul
is
partly
mythical
or
figurative
and
partly
literal
not
that
either
he
or
we
can
draw
a
line
between
them
or
say
is
poetry
this
is
philosophy
for
the
transition
from
the
one
to
the
other
is
imperceptible
neither
must
we
expect
to
find
in
him
absolute
consistency
he
is
apt
to
pass
from
one
level
or
stage
of
thought
to
another
without
always
making
it
apparent
that
he
is
changing
his
ground
in
such
passages
we
have
to
interpret
his
meaning
by
the
general
spirit
of
his
writings
to
reconcile
his
inconsistencies
would
be
contrary
to
the
first
principles
of
criticism
and
fatal
to
any
true
understanding
of
him
there
is
a
further
difficulty
in
explaining
this
part
of
the
timaeus
the
natural
order
of
thought
is
inverted
we
begin
with
the
most
abstract
and
proceed
from
the
abstract
to
the
concrete
we
are
searching
into
things
which
are
upon
the
utmost
limit
of
human
intelligence
and
then
of
a
sudden
we
fall
rather
heavily
to
the
earth
there
are
no
intermediate
steps
which
lead
from
one
to
the
other
but
the
abstract
is
a
vacant
form
to
us
until
brought
into
relation
with
man
and
nature
god
and
the
world
are
mere
names
like
the
being
of
the
eleatics
unless
some
human
qualities
are
added
on
to
them
yet
the
negation
has
a
kind
of
unknown
meaning
to
us
the
priority
of
god
and
of
the
world
which
he
is
imagined
to
have
created
to
all
other
existences
gives
a
solemn
awe
to
them
and
as
in
other
systems
of
theology
and
philosophy
that
of
which
we
know
least
has
the
greatest
interest
to
us
there
is
no
use
in
attempting
to
define
or
explain
the
first
god
in
the
platonic
system
who
has
sometimes
been
thought
to
answer
to
god
the
father
or
the
world
in
whom
the
fathers
of
the
church
seemed
to
recognize
firstborn
of
every
creature
nor
need
we
discuss
at
length
how
far
plato
agrees
in
the
later
jewish
idea
of
creation
according
to
which
god
made
the
world
out
of
nothing
for
his
original
conception
of
matter
as
something
which
has
no
qualities
is
really
a
negation
moreover
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
the
creation
of
the
world
is
described
even
more
explicitly
than
in
the
timaeus
not
as
a
single
act
but
as
a
work
or
process
which
occupied
six
days
there
is
a
chaos
in
both
and
it
would
be
untrue
to
say
that
the
greek
any
more
than
the
hebrew
had
any
definite
belief
in
the
eternal
existence
of
matter
the
beginning
of
things
vanished
into
the
distance
the
real
creation
began
not
with
matter
but
with
ideas
according
to
plato
in
the
timaeus
god
took
of
the
same
and
the
other
of
the
divided
and
undivided
of
the
finite
and
infinite
and
made
essence
and
out
of
the
three
combined
created
the
soul
of
the
world
to
the
soul
he
added
a
body
formed
out
of
the
four
elements
the
general
meaning
of
these
words
is
that
god
imparted
determinations
of
thought
or
as
we
might
say
gave
law
and
variety
to
the
material
universe
the
elements
are
moving
in
a
disorderly
manner
before
the
work
of
creation
begins
and
there
is
an
eternal
pattern
of
the
world
which
like
the
of
good
is
not
the
creator
himself
but
not
separable
from
him
the
pattern
too
though
eternal
is
a
creation
a
world
of
thought
prior
to
the
world
of
sense
which
may
be
compared
to
the
wisdom
of
god
in
the
book
of
ecclesiasticus
or
to
the
in
the
form
of
a
globe
of
the
old
eleatic
philosophers
the
visible
which
already
exists
is
fashioned
in
the
likeness
of
this
eternal
pattern
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
truth
of
which
plato
is
more
firmly
convinced
than
of
the
priority
of
the
soul
to
the
body
both
in
the
universe
and
in
man
so
inconsistent
are
the
forms
in
which
he
describes
the
works
which
no
tongue
can
utter
his
language
as
he
himself
says
partaking
of
his
own
uncertainty
about
the
things
of
which
he
is
speaking
we
may
remark
in
passing
that
the
platonic
compared
with
the
jewish
description
of
the
process
of
creation
has
less
of
freedom
or
spontaneity
the
creator
in
plato
is
still
subject
to
a
remnant
of
necessity
which
he
can
not
wholly
overcome
when
his
work
is
accomplished
he
remains
in
his
own
nature
plato
is
more
sensible
than
the
hebrew
prophet
of
the
existence
of
evil
which
he
seeks
to
put
as
far
as
possible
out
of
the
way
of
god
and
he
can
only
suppose
this
to
be
accomplished
by
god
retiring
into
himself
and
committing
the
lesser
works
of
creation
to
inferior
powers
compare
however
laws
for
another
solution
of
the
difficulty
nor
can
we
attach
any
intelligible
meaning
to
his
words
when
he
speaks
of
the
visible
being
in
the
image
of
the
invisible
for
how
can
that
which
is
divided
be
like
that
which
is
undivided
or
that
which
is
changing
be
the
copy
of
that
which
is
unchanging
all
the
old
difficulties
about
the
ideas
come
back
upon
us
in
an
altered
form
we
can
imagine
two
worlds
one
of
which
is
the
mere
double
of
the
other
or
one
of
which
is
an
imperfect
copy
of
the
other
or
one
of
which
is
the
vanishing
ideal
of
the
other
but
we
can
not
imagine
an
intellectual
world
which
has
no
qualities
thing
in
itself
a
point
which
has
no
parts
or
magnitude
which
is
nowhere
and
nothing
this
can
not
be
the
archetype
according
to
which
god
made
the
world
and
is
in
reality
whether
in
plato
or
in
kant
a
mere
negative
residuum
of
human
thought
there
is
another
aspect
of
the
same
difficulty
which
appears
to
have
no
satisfactory
solution
in
what
relation
does
the
archetype
stand
to
the
creator
himself
for
the
idea
or
pattern
of
the
world
is
not
the
thought
of
god
but
a
separate
nature
of
which
creation
is
the
copy
we
can
only
reply
that
to
the
mind
of
plato
subject
and
object
were
not
yet
distinguished
that
he
supposes
the
process
of
creation
to
take
place
in
accordance
with
his
own
theory
of
ideas
and
as
we
can
not
give
a
consistent
account
of
the
one
neither
can
we
of
the
other
he
means
to
say
that
the
creation
of
the
world
is
not
a
material
process
of
working
with
legs
and
arms
but
ideal
and
intellectual
according
to
his
own
fine
expression
thought
of
god
made
the
god
that
was
to
be
he
means
to
draw
an
absolute
distinction
between
the
invisible
or
unchangeable
which
is
or
is
the
place
of
mind
or
being
and
the
world
of
sense
or
becoming
which
is
visible
and
changing
he
means
that
the
idea
of
the
world
is
prior
to
the
world
just
as
the
other
ideas
are
prior
to
sensible
objects
and
like
them
may
be
regarded
as
eternal
and
and
also
like
the
idea
of
good
may
be
viewed
apart
from
the
divine
mind
there
are
several
other
questions
which
we
might
ask
and
which
can
receive
no
answer
or
at
least
only
an
answer
of
the
same
kind
as
the
preceding
how
can
matter
be
conceived
to
exist
without
form
or
how
can
the
essences
or
forms
of
things
be
distinguished
from
the
eternal
ideas
or
essence
itself
from
the
soul
or
how
could
there
have
been
motion
in
the
chaos
when
as
yet
time
was
not
or
how
did
chaos
come
into
existence
if
not
by
the
will
of
the
creator
or
how
could
there
have
been
a
time
when
the
world
was
not
if
time
was
not
or
how
could
the
creator
have
taken
portions
of
an
indivisible
same
or
how
could
space
or
anything
else
have
been
eternal
when
time
is
only
created
or
how
could
the
surfaces
of
geometrical
figures
have
formed
solids
we
must
reply
again
that
we
can
not
follow
plato
in
all
his
inconsistencies
but
that
the
gaps
of
thought
are
probably
more
apparent
to
us
than
to
him
he
would
perhaps
have
said
that
first
things
are
known
only
to
god
and
to
him
of
men
whom
god
loves
how
often
have
the
gaps
in
theology
been
concealed
from
the
eye
of
faith
and
we
may
say
that
only
by
an
effort
of
metaphysical
imagination
can
we
hope
to
understand
plato
from
his
own
point
of
view
we
must
not
ask
for
consistency
everywhere
we
find
traces
of
the
platonic
theory
of
knowledge
expressed
in
an
objective
form
which
by
us
has
to
be
translated
into
the
subjective
before
we
can
attach
any
meaning
to
it
and
this
theory
is
exhibited
in
so
many
different
points
of
view
that
we
can
not
with
any
certainty
interpret
one
dialogue
by
another
the
timaeus
by
the
parmenides
or
phaedrus
or
philebus
the
soul
of
the
world
may
also
be
conceived
as
the
personification
of
the
numbers
and
figures
in
which
the
heavenly
bodies
move
imagine
these
as
in
a
pythagorean
dream
stripped
of
qualitative
difference
and
reduced
to
mathematical
abstractions
they
too
conform
to
the
principle
of
the
same
and
may
be
compared
with
the
modern
conception
of
laws
of
nature
they
are
in
space
but
not
in
time
and
they
are
the
makers
of
time
they
are
represented
as
constantly
thinking
of
the
same
for
thought
in
the
view
of
plato
is
equivalent
to
truth
or
law
and
need
not
imply
a
human
consciousness
a
conception
which
is
familiar
enough
to
us
but
has
no
place
hardly
even
a
name
in
ancient
greek
philosophy
to
this
principle
of
the
same
is
opposed
the
principle
of
the
other
the
principle
of
irregularity
and
disorder
of
necessity
and
chance
which
is
only
partially
impressed
by
mathematical
laws
and
figures
we
may
observe
by
the
way
that
the
principle
of
the
other
which
is
the
principle
of
plurality
and
variation
in
the
timaeus
has
nothing
in
common
with
the
of
the
sophist
which
is
the
principle
of
determination
the
element
of
the
same
dominates
to
a
certain
extent
over
the
other
the
fixed
stars
keep
the
of
the
inner
circle
in
their
courses
and
a
similar
principle
of
fixedness
or
order
appears
to
regulate
the
bodily
constitution
of
man
but
there
still
remains
a
rebellious
seed
of
evil
derived
from
the
original
chaos
which
is
the
source
of
disorder
in
the
world
and
of
vice
and
disease
in
man
but
what
did
plato
mean
by
essence
greek
which
is
the
intermediate
nature
compounded
of
the
same
and
the
other
and
out
of
which
together
with
these
two
the
soul
of
the
world
is
created
it
is
difficult
to
explain
a
process
of
thought
so
strange
and
unaccustomed
to
us
in
which
modern
distinctions
run
into
one
another
and
are
lost
sight
of
first
let
us
consider
once
more
the
meaning
of
the
same
and
the
other
the
same
is
the
unchanging
and
indivisible
the
heaven
of
the
fixed
stars
partaking
of
the
divine
nature
which
having
law
in
itself
gives
law
to
all
besides
and
is
the
element
of
order
and
permanence
in
man
and
on
the
earth
it
is
the
rational
principle
mind
regarded
as
a
work
as
creation
not
as
the
creator
the
old
tradition
of
parmenides
and
of
the
eleatic
being
the
foundation
of
so
much
in
the
philosophy
of
greece
and
of
the
world
was
lingering
in
plato
mind
the
other
is
the
variable
or
changing
element
the
residuum
of
disorder
or
chaos
which
can
not
be
reduced
to
order
nor
altogether
banished
the
source
of
evil
seen
in
the
errors
of
man
and
also
in
the
wanderings
of
the
planets
a
necessity
which
protrudes
through
nature
of
this
too
there
was
a
shadow
in
the
eleatic
philosophy
in
the
realm
of
opinion
which
like
a
mist
seemed
to
darken
the
purity
of
truth
in
so
far
the
words
of
plato
may
perhaps
find
an
intelligible
meaning
but
when
he
goes
on
to
speak
of
the
essence
which
is
compounded
out
of
both
the
track
becomes
fainter
and
we
can
only
follow
him
with
hesitating
steps
but
still
we
find
a
trace
reappearing
of
the
teaching
of
anaxagoras
was
confusion
and
then
mind
came
and
arranged
things
we
have
already
remarked
that
plato
was
not
acquainted
with
the
modern
distinction
of
subject
and
object
and
therefore
he
sometimes
confuses
mind
and
the
things
of
mind
greek
and
greek
by
greek
he
clearly
means
some
conception
of
the
intelligible
and
the
intelligent
it
belongs
to
the
class
of
greek
matter
being
the
same
the
eternal
for
any
of
these
terms
being
almost
vacant
of
meaning
is
equally
suitable
to
express
indefinite
existence
are
compared
or
united
with
the
other
or
diverse
and
out
of
the
union
or
comparison
is
elicited
the
idea
of
intelligence
the
in
many
brighter
than
any
promethean
fire
phil
which
with
them
and
so
forming
a
new
existence
is
or
becomes
the
intelligible
world
so
we
may
perhaps
venture
to
paraphrase
or
interpret
or
put
into
other
words
the
parable
in
which
plato
has
wrapped
up
his
conception
of
the
creation
of
the
world
the
explanation
may
help
to
fill
up
with
figures
of
speech
the
void
of
knowledge
the
entire
compound
was
divided
by
the
creator
in
certain
proportions
and
reunited
it
was
then
cut
into
two
strips
which
were
bent
into
an
inner
circle
and
an
outer
both
moving
with
an
uniform
motion
around
a
centre
the
outer
circle
containing
the
fixed
the
inner
the
wandering
stars
the
soul
of
the
world
was
diffused
everywhere
from
the
centre
to
the
circumference
to
this
god
gave
a
body
consisting
at
first
of
fire
and
earth
and
afterwards
receiving
an
addition
of
air
and
water
because
solid
bodies
like
the
world
are
always
connected
by
two
middle
terms
and
not
by
one
the
world
was
made
in
the
form
of
a
globe
and
all
the
material
elements
were
exhausted
in
the
work
of
creation
the
proportions
in
which
the
soul
of
the
world
as
well
as
the
human
soul
is
divided
answer
to
a
series
of
numbers
composed
of
the
two
pythagorean
progressions
and
of
which
the
number
represents
a
point
and
lines
and
and
the
squares
and
cubes
respectively
of
and
this
series
of
which
the
intervals
are
afterwards
filled
up
probably
represents
the
diatonic
scale
according
to
the
pythagoreans
and
plato
the
order
and
distances
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
may
possibly
contain
an
allusion
to
the
music
of
the
spheres
which
is
referred
to
in
the
myth
at
the
end
of
the
republic
the
meaning
of
the
words
that
bodies
are
always
connected
by
two
middle
terms
or
mean
proportionals
has
been
much
disputed
the
most
received
explanation
is
that
of
martin
who
supposes
that
plato
is
only
speaking
of
surfaces
and
solids
compounded
of
prime
numbers
of
numbers
not
made
up
of
two
factors
or
in
other
words
only
measurable
by
unity
the
square
of
any
such
number
represents
a
surface
the
cube
a
solid
the
squares
of
any
two
such
numbers
squared
squared
have
always
a
single
mean
proportional
and
have
the
single
mean
whereas
the
cubes
of
primes
cubed
and
cubed
have
always
two
mean
proportionals
but
to
this
explanation
of
martin
it
may
be
objected
that
plato
nowhere
says
that
his
proportion
is
to
be
limited
to
prime
numbers
that
the
limitation
of
surfaces
to
squares
is
also
not
to
be
found
in
his
words
nor
is
there
any
evidence
to
show
that
the
distinction
of
prime
from
other
numbers
was
known
to
him
what
plato
chiefly
intends
to
express
is
that
a
solid
requires
a
stronger
bond
than
a
surface
and
that
the
double
bond
which
is
given
by
two
means
is
stronger
than
the
single
bond
given
by
one
having
reflected
on
the
singular
numerical
phenomena
of
the
existence
of
one
mean
proportional
between
two
square
numbers
are
rather
perhaps
only
between
the
two
lowest
squares
and
of
two
mean
proportionals
between
two
cubes
perhaps
again
confining
his
attention
to
the
two
lowest
cubes
he
finds
in
the
latter
symbol
an
expression
of
the
relation
of
the
elements
as
in
the
former
an
image
of
the
combination
of
two
surfaces
between
fire
and
earth
the
two
extremes
he
remarks
that
there
are
introduced
not
one
but
two
elements
air
and
water
which
are
compared
to
the
two
mean
proportionals
between
two
cube
numbers
the
vagueness
of
his
language
does
not
allow
us
to
determine
whether
anything
more
than
this
was
intended
by
him
leaving
the
further
explanation
of
details
which
the
reader
will
find
discussed
at
length
in
boeckh
and
martin
we
may
now
return
to
the
main
argument
why
did
god
make
the
world
like
man
he
must
have
a
purpose
and
his
purpose
is
the
diffusion
of
that
goodness
or
good
which
he
himself
is
the
term
is
not
to
be
understood
in
this
passage
as
meaning
benevolence
or
love
in
the
christian
sense
of
the
term
but
rather
law
order
harmony
like
the
idea
of
good
in
the
republic
the
ancient
mythologers
and
even
the
hebrew
prophets
had
spoken
of
the
jealousy
of
god
and
the
greek
had
imagined
that
there
was
a
nemesis
always
attending
the
prosperity
of
mortals
but
plato
delights
to
think
of
god
as
the
author
of
order
in
his
works
who
like
a
father
lives
over
again
in
his
children
and
can
never
have
too
much
of
good
or
friendship
among
his
creatures
only
as
there
is
a
certain
remnant
of
evil
inherent
in
matter
which
he
can
not
get
rid
of
he
detaches
himself
from
them
and
leaves
them
to
themselves
that
he
may
be
guiltless
of
their
faults
and
sufferings
between
the
ideal
and
the
sensible
plato
interposes
the
two
natures
of
time
and
space
time
is
conceived
by
him
to
be
only
the
shadow
or
image
of
eternity
which
ever
is
and
never
has
been
or
will
be
but
is
described
in
a
figure
only
as
past
or
future
this
is
one
of
the
great
thoughts
of
early
philosophy
which
are
still
as
difficult
to
our
minds
as
they
were
to
the
early
thinkers
or
perhaps
more
difficult
because
we
more
distinctly
see
the
consequences
which
are
involved
in
such
an
hypothesis
all
the
objections
which
may
be
urged
against
doctrine
of
the
ideality
of
space
and
time
at
once
press
upon
us
if
time
is
unreal
then
all
which
is
contained
in
time
is
unreal
the
succession
of
human
thoughts
as
well
as
the
flux
of
sensations
there
is
no
connecting
link
between
greek
and
greek
yet
on
the
other
hand
we
are
conscious
that
knowledge
is
independent
of
time
that
truth
is
not
a
thing
of
yesterday
or
tomorrow
but
an
now
to
the
of
all
time
and
all
existence
the
universe
remains
at
rest
the
truths
of
geometry
and
arithmetic
in
all
their
combinations
are
always
the
same
the
generations
of
men
like
the
leaves
of
the
forest
come
and
go
but
the
mathematical
laws
by
which
the
world
is
governed
remain
and
seem
as
if
they
could
never
change
the
image
of
space
is
transferred
to
time
succession
is
conceived
as
extension
we
remark
that
plato
does
away
with
the
above
and
below
in
space
as
he
has
done
away
with
the
absolute
existence
of
past
and
future
the
course
of
time
unless
regularly
marked
by
divisions
of
number
partakes
of
the
indefiniteness
of
the
heraclitean
flux
by
such
reflections
we
may
conceive
the
greek
to
have
attained
the
metaphysical
conception
of
eternity
which
to
the
hebrew
was
gained
by
meditation
on
the
divine
being
no
one
saw
that
this
objective
was
really
a
subjective
and
involved
the
subjectivity
of
all
knowledge
in
tempore
sed
cum
tempore
finxit
deus
mundum
says
augustine
repeating
a
thought
derived
from
the
timaeus
but
apparently
unconscious
of
the
results
to
which
his
doctrine
would
have
led
the
contradictions
involved
in
the
conception
of
time
or
motion
like
the
infinitesimal
in
space
were
a
source
of
perplexity
to
the
mind
of
the
greek
who
was
driven
to
find
a
point
of
view
above
or
beyond
them
they
had
sprung
up
in
the
decline
of
the
eleatic
philosophy
and
were
very
familiar
to
plato
as
we
gather
from
the
parmenides
the
consciousness
of
them
had
led
the
great
eleatic
philosopher
to
describe
the
nature
of
god
or
being
under
negatives
he
sings
of
unbegotten
and
imperishable
unmoved
and
which
never
was
nor
will
be
but
always
is
one
and
continuous
which
can
not
spring
from
any
other
for
it
can
not
be
said
or
imagined
not
to
be
the
idea
of
eternity
was
for
a
great
part
a
negation
there
are
regions
of
speculation
in
which
the
negative
is
hardly
separable
from
the
positive
and
even
seems
to
pass
into
it
not
only
buddhism
but
greek
as
well
as
christian
philosophy
show
that
it
is
quite
possible
that
the
human
mind
should
retain
an
enthusiasm
for
mere
negations
in
different
ages
and
countries
there
have
been
forms
of
light
in
which
nothing
could
be
discerned
and
which
have
nevertheless
exercised
a
and
illumining
power
for
the
higher
intelligence
of
man
seems
to
require
not
only
something
above
sense
but
above
knowledge
which
can
only
be
described
as
mind
or
being
or
truth
or
god
or
the
unchangeable
and
eternal
element
in
the
expression
of
which
all
predicates
fail
and
fall
short
eternity
or
the
eternal
is
not
merely
the
unlimited
in
time
but
the
truest
of
all
being
the
most
real
of
all
realities
the
most
certain
of
all
knowledge
which
we
nevertheless
only
see
through
a
glass
darkly
the
passionate
earnestness
of
parmenides
contrasts
with
the
vacuity
of
the
thought
which
he
is
revolving
in
his
mind
space
is
said
by
plato
to
be
the
vessel
or
nurse
of
generation
reflecting
on
the
simplest
kinds
of
external
objects
which
to
the
ancients
were
the
four
elements
he
was
led
to
a
more
general
notion
of
a
substance
more
or
less
like
themselves
out
of
which
they
were
fashioned
he
would
not
have
them
too
precisely
distinguished
thus
seems
to
have
arisen
the
first
dim
perception
of
greek
or
matter
which
has
played
so
great
a
part
in
the
metaphysical
philosophy
of
aristotle
and
his
followers
but
besides
the
material
out
of
which
the
elements
are
made
there
is
also
a
space
in
which
they
are
contained
there
arises
thus
a
second
nature
which
the
senses
are
incapable
of
discerning
and
which
can
hardly
be
referred
to
the
intelligible
class
for
it
is
and
it
is
not
it
is
nowhere
when
filled
it
is
nothing
when
empty
hence
it
is
said
to
be
discerned
by
a
kind
of
spurious
or
analogous
reason
partaking
so
feebly
of
existence
as
to
be
hardly
perceivable
yet
always
reappearing
as
the
containing
mother
or
nurse
of
all
things
it
had
not
that
sort
of
consistency
to
plato
which
has
been
given
to
it
in
modern
times
by
geometry
and
metaphysics
neither
of
the
greek
words
by
which
it
is
described
are
so
purely
abstract
as
the
english
word
or
the
latin
neither
plato
nor
any
other
greek
would
have
spoken
of
greek
or
greek
in
the
same
manner
as
we
speak
of
and
yet
space
is
also
of
a
very
permanent
or
even
eternal
nature
and
plato
seems
more
willing
to
admit
of
the
unreality
of
time
than
of
the
unreality
of
space
because
as
he
says
all
things
must
necessarily
exist
in
space
we
on
the
other
hand
are
disposed
to
fancy
that
even
if
space
were
annihilated
time
might
still
survive
he
admits
indeed
that
our
knowledge
of
space
is
of
a
dreamy
kind
and
is
given
by
a
spurious
reason
without
the
help
of
sense
compare
the
hypotheses
and
images
of
it
is
true
that
it
does
not
attain
to
the
clearness
of
ideas
but
like
them
it
seems
to
remain
even
if
all
the
objects
contained
in
it
are
supposed
to
have
vanished
away
hence
it
was
natural
for
plato
to
conceive
of
it
as
eternal
we
must
remember
further
that
in
his
attempt
to
realize
either
space
or
matter
the
two
abstract
ideas
of
weight
and
extension
which
are
familiar
to
us
had
never
passed
before
his
mind
thus
far
god
working
according
to
an
eternal
pattern
out
of
his
goodness
has
created
the
same
the
other
and
the
essence
compare
the
three
principles
of
the
philebus
the
finite
the
infinite
and
the
union
of
the
two
and
out
of
them
has
formed
the
outer
circle
of
the
fixed
stars
and
the
inner
circle
of
the
planets
divided
according
to
certain
musical
intervals
he
has
also
created
time
the
moving
image
of
eternity
and
space
existing
by
a
sort
of
necessity
and
hardly
distinguishable
from
matter
the
matter
out
of
which
the
world
is
formed
is
not
absolutely
void
but
retains
in
the
chaos
certain
germs
or
traces
of
the
elements
these
plato
like
empedocles
supposed
to
be
four
in
number
fire
air
earth
and
water
they
were
at
first
mixed
together
but
already
in
the
chaos
before
god
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
the
greater
masses
of
the
elements
had
an
appointed
place
into
the
confusion
greek
which
preceded
plato
does
not
attempt
further
to
penetrate
they
are
called
elements
but
they
are
so
far
from
being
elements
greek
or
letters
in
the
higher
sense
that
they
are
not
even
syllables
or
first
compounds
the
real
elements
are
two
triangles
the
rectangular
isosceles
which
has
but
one
form
and
the
most
beautiful
of
the
many
forms
of
scalene
which
is
half
of
an
equilateral
triangle
by
the
combination
of
these
triangles
which
exist
in
an
infinite
variety
of
sizes
the
surfaces
of
the
four
elements
are
constructed
that
there
were
only
five
regular
solids
was
already
known
to
the
ancients
and
out
of
the
surfaces
which
he
has
formed
plato
proceeds
to
generate
the
four
first
of
the
five
he
perhaps
forgets
that
he
is
only
putting
together
surfaces
and
has
not
provided
for
their
transformation
into
solids
the
first
solid
is
a
regular
pyramid
of
which
the
base
and
sides
are
formed
by
four
equilateral
or
scalene
triangles
each
of
the
four
solid
angles
in
this
figure
is
a
little
larger
than
the
largest
of
obtuse
angles
the
second
solid
is
composed
of
the
same
triangles
which
unite
as
eight
equilateral
triangles
and
make
one
solid
angle
out
of
four
plane
angles
six
of
these
angles
form
a
regular
octahedron
the
third
solid
is
a
regular
icosahedron
having
twenty
triangular
equilateral
bases
and
therefore
rectangular
scalene
triangles
the
fourth
regular
solid
or
cube
is
formed
by
the
combination
of
four
isosceles
triangles
into
one
square
and
of
six
squares
into
a
cube
the
fifth
regular
solid
or
dodecahedron
can
not
be
formed
by
a
combination
of
either
of
these
triangles
but
each
of
its
faces
may
be
regarded
as
composed
of
thirty
triangles
of
another
kind
probably
plato
notices
this
as
the
only
remaining
regular
polyhedron
which
from
its
approximation
to
a
globe
and
possibly
because
as
plutarch
remarks
it
is
composed
of
x
scalene
triangles
platon
quaest
representing
thus
the
signs
and
degrees
of
the
zodiac
as
well
as
the
months
and
days
of
the
year
god
may
be
said
to
have
in
the
delineation
of
the
universe
according
to
plato
earth
was
composed
of
cubes
fire
of
regular
pyramids
air
of
regular
octahedrons
water
of
regular
icosahedrons
the
stability
of
the
last
three
increases
with
the
number
of
their
sides
the
elements
are
supposed
to
pass
into
one
another
but
we
must
remember
that
these
transformations
are
not
the
transformations
of
real
solids
but
of
imaginary
geometrical
figures
in
other
words
we
are
composing
and
decomposing
the
faces
of
substances
and
not
the
substances
themselves
it
is
a
house
of
cards
which
we
are
pulling
to
pieces
and
putting
together
again
compare
however
laws
yet
perhaps
plato
may
regard
these
sides
or
faces
as
only
the
forms
which
are
impressed
on
matter
it
is
remarkable
that
he
should
speak
of
each
of
these
solids
as
a
possible
world
in
itself
though
upon
the
whole
he
inclines
to
the
opinion
that
they
form
one
world
and
not
five
to
suppose
that
there
is
an
infinite
number
of
worlds
as
democritus
hippolyt
ref
haer
i
had
said
would
be
as
he
satirically
observes
characteristic
of
a
very
indefinite
and
ignorant
mind
the
twenty
triangular
faces
of
an
icosahedron
form
the
faces
or
sides
of
two
regular
octahedrons
and
of
a
regular
pyramid
x
and
therefore
according
to
plato
a
particle
of
water
when
decomposed
is
supposed
to
give
two
particles
of
air
and
one
of
fire
so
because
an
octahedron
gives
the
sides
of
two
pyramids
x
a
particle
of
air
is
resolved
into
two
particles
of
fire
the
transformation
is
effected
by
the
superior
power
or
number
of
the
conquering
elements
the
manner
of
the
change
is
a
separation
of
portions
of
the
elements
from
the
masses
in
which
they
are
collected
a
resolution
of
them
into
their
original
triangles
and
a
reunion
of
them
in
new
forms
plato
himself
proposes
the
question
why
does
motion
continue
at
all
when
the
elements
are
settled
in
their
places
he
answers
that
although
the
force
of
attraction
is
continually
drawing
similar
elements
to
the
same
spot
still
the
revolution
of
the
universe
exercises
a
condensing
power
and
thrusts
them
again
out
of
their
natural
places
thus
want
of
uniformity
the
condition
of
motion
is
produced
in
all
such
disturbances
of
matter
there
is
an
alternative
for
the
weaker
element
it
may
escape
to
its
kindred
or
take
the
form
of
the
stronger
becoming
denser
if
it
be
denser
or
rarer
if
rarer
this
is
true
of
fire
air
and
water
which
being
composed
of
similar
triangles
are
interchangeable
earth
however
which
has
triangles
peculiar
to
itself
is
capable
of
dissolution
but
not
of
change
of
the
interchangeable
elements
fire
the
rarest
can
only
become
a
denser
and
water
the
densest
only
a
rarer
but
air
may
become
a
denser
or
a
rarer
no
single
particle
of
the
elements
is
visible
but
only
the
aggregates
of
them
are
seen
the
subordinate
species
depend
not
upon
differences
of
form
in
the
original
triangles
but
upon
differences
of
size
the
obvious
physical
phenomena
from
which
plato
has
gathered
his
views
of
the
relations
of
the
elements
seem
to
be
the
effect
of
fire
upon
air
water
and
earth
and
the
effect
of
water
upon
earth
the
particles
are
supposed
by
him
to
be
in
a
perpetual
process
of
circulation
caused
by
inequality
this
process
of
circulation
does
not
admit
of
a
vacuum
as
he
tells
us
in
his
strange
account
of
respiration
of
the
phenomena
of
light
and
heavy
he
speaks
afterwards
when
treating
of
sensation
but
they
may
be
more
conveniently
considered
by
us
in
this
place
they
are
not
he
says
to
be
explained
by
and
which
in
the
universal
globe
have
no
existence
but
by
the
attraction
of
similars
towards
the
great
masses
of
similar
substances
fire
to
fire
air
to
air
water
to
water
earth
to
earth
plato
doctrine
of
attraction
implies
not
only
the
attraction
of
similar
elements
to
one
another
but
also
of
smaller
bodies
to
larger
ones
had
he
confined
himself
to
the
latter
he
would
have
arrived
though
perhaps
without
any
further
result
or
any
sense
of
the
greatness
of
the
discovery
at
the
modern
doctrine
of
gravitation
he
does
not
observe
that
water
has
an
equal
tendency
towards
both
water
and
earth
so
easily
did
the
most
obvious
facts
which
were
inconsistent
with
his
theories
escape
him
the
general
physical
doctrines
of
the
timaeus
may
be
summed
up
as
follows
plato
supposes
the
greater
masses
of
the
elements
to
have
been
already
settled
in
their
places
at
the
creation
they
are
four
in
number
and
are
formed
of
rectangular
triangles
variously
combined
into
regular
solid
figures
three
of
them
fire
air
and
water
admit
of
transformation
into
one
another
the
fourth
earth
can
not
be
similarly
transformed
different
sizes
of
the
same
triangles
form
the
lesser
species
of
each
element
there
is
an
attraction
of
like
to
like
smaller
masses
of
the
same
kind
being
drawn
towards
greater
there
is
no
void
but
the
particles
of
matter
are
ever
pushing
one
another
round
and
round
greek
like
the
atomists
plato
attributes
the
differences
between
the
elements
to
differences
in
geometrical
figures
but
he
does
not
explain
the
process
by
which
surfaces
become
solids
and
he
characteristically
ridicules
democritus
for
not
seeing
that
the
worlds
are
finite
and
not
infinite
section
the
astronomy
of
plato
is
based
on
the
two
principles
of
the
same
and
the
other
which
god
combined
in
the
creation
of
the
world
the
soul
which
is
compounded
of
the
same
the
other
and
the
essence
is
diffused
from
the
centre
to
the
circumference
of
the
heavens
we
speak
of
a
soul
of
the
universe
but
more
truly
regarded
the
universe
of
the
timaeus
is
a
soul
governed
by
mind
and
holding
in
solution
a
residuum
of
matter
or
evil
which
the
author
of
the
world
is
unable
to
expel
and
of
which
plato
can
not
tell
us
the
origin
the
creation
in
plato
sense
is
really
the
creation
of
order
and
the
first
step
in
giving
order
is
the
division
of
the
heavens
into
an
inner
and
outer
circle
of
the
other
and
the
same
of
the
divisible
and
the
indivisible
answering
to
the
two
spheres
of
the
planets
and
of
the
world
beyond
them
all
together
moving
around
the
earth
which
is
their
centre
to
us
there
is
a
difficulty
in
apprehending
how
that
which
is
at
rest
can
also
be
in
motion
or
that
which
is
indivisible
exist
in
space
but
the
whole
description
is
so
ideal
and
imaginative
that
we
can
hardly
venture
to
attribute
to
many
of
plato
words
in
the
timaeus
any
more
meaning
than
to
his
mythical
account
of
the
heavens
in
the
republic
and
in
the
phaedrus
compare
his
denial
of
the
opinion
that
there
are
planets
or
wandering
stars
all
alike
move
in
circles
laws
the
stars
are
the
habitations
of
the
souls
of
men
from
which
they
come
and
to
which
they
return
in
attributing
to
the
fixed
stars
only
the
most
perfect
motion
that
which
is
on
the
same
spot
or
circulating
around
the
same
he
might
perhaps
have
said
that
to
spectator
of
all
time
and
all
existence
to
borrow
once
more
his
own
grand
expression
or
viewed
in
the
language
of
spinoza
specie
aeternitatis
they
were
still
at
rest
but
appeared
to
move
in
order
to
teach
men
the
periods
of
time
although
absolutely
in
motion
they
are
relatively
at
rest
or
we
may
conceive
of
them
as
resting
while
the
space
in
which
they
are
contained
or
the
whole
anima
mundi
revolves
the
universe
revolves
around
a
centre
once
in
hours
but
the
orbits
of
the
fixed
stars
take
a
different
direction
from
those
of
the
planets
the
outer
and
the
inner
sphere
cross
one
another
and
meet
again
at
a
point
opposite
to
that
of
their
first
contact
the
first
moving
in
a
circle
from
left
to
right
along
the
side
of
a
parallelogram
which
is
supposed
to
be
inscribed
in
it
the
second
also
moving
in
a
circle
along
the
diagonal
of
the
same
parallelogram
from
right
to
left
or
in
other
words
the
first
describing
the
path
of
the
equator
the
second
the
path
of
the
ecliptic
the
motion
of
the
second
is
controlled
by
the
first
and
hence
the
oblique
line
in
which
the
planets
are
supposed
to
move
becomes
a
spiral
the
motion
of
the
same
is
said
to
be
undivided
whereas
the
inner
motion
is
split
into
seven
unequal
orbits
the
intervals
between
them
being
in
the
ratio
of
two
and
three
three
of
either
the
sun
moving
in
the
opposite
direction
to
mercury
and
venus
but
with
equal
swiftness
the
remaining
four
moon
saturn
mars
jupiter
with
unequal
swiftness
to
the
former
three
and
to
one
another
thus
arises
the
following
progression
moon
sun
venus
mercury
mars
jupiter
saturn
this
series
of
numbers
is
the
compound
of
the
two
pythagorean
ratios
having
the
same
intervals
though
not
in
the
same
order
as
the
mixture
which
was
originally
divided
in
forming
the
soul
of
the
world
plato
was
struck
by
the
phenomenon
of
mercury
venus
and
the
sun
appearing
to
overtake
and
be
overtaken
by
one
another
the
true
reason
of
this
namely
that
they
lie
within
the
circle
of
the
earth
orbit
was
unknown
to
him
and
the
reason
which
he
gives
that
the
two
former
move
in
an
opposite
direction
to
the
latter
is
far
from
explaining
the
appearance
of
them
in
the
heavens
all
the
planets
including
the
sun
are
carried
round
in
the
daily
motion
of
the
circle
of
the
fixed
stars
and
they
have
a
second
or
oblique
motion
which
gives
the
explanation
of
the
different
lengths
of
the
sun
course
in
different
parts
of
the
earth
the
fixed
stars
have
also
two
movements
a
forward
movement
in
their
orbit
which
is
common
to
the
whole
circle
and
a
movement
on
the
same
spot
around
an
axis
which
plato
calls
the
movement
of
thought
about
the
same
in
this
latter
respect
they
are
more
perfect
than
the
wandering
stars
as
plato
himself
terms
them
in
the
timaeus
although
in
the
laws
he
condemns
the
appellation
as
blasphemous
the
revolution
of
the
world
around
earth
which
is
accomplished
in
a
single
day
and
night
is
described
as
being
the
most
perfect
or
intelligent
yet
plato
also
speaks
of
an
magnus
or
cyclical
year
in
which
periods
wonderful
for
their
complexity
are
found
to
coincide
in
a
perfect
number
a
number
which
equals
the
sum
of
its
factors
as
this
although
not
literally
contradictory
is
in
spirit
irreconcilable
with
the
perfect
revolution
of
hours
the
same
remark
may
be
applied
to
the
complexity
of
the
appearances
and
occultations
of
the
stars
which
if
the
outer
heaven
is
supposed
to
be
moving
around
the
centre
once
in
hours
must
be
confined
to
the
effects
produced
by
the
seven
planets
plato
seems
to
confuse
the
actual
observation
of
the
heavens
with
his
desire
to
find
in
them
mathematical
perfection
the
same
spirit
is
carried
yet
further
by
him
in
the
passage
already
quoted
from
the
laws
in
which
he
affirms
their
wanderings
to
be
an
appearance
only
which
a
little
knowledge
of
mathematics
would
enable
men
to
correct
we
have
now
to
consider
the
much
discussed
question
of
the
rotation
or
immobility
of
the
earth
plato
doctrine
on
this
subject
is
contained
in
the
following
words
earth
which
is
our
nurse
compacted
or
revolving
around
the
pole
which
is
extended
through
the
universe
he
made
to
be
the
guardian
and
artificer
of
night
and
day
first
and
eldest
of
gods
that
are
in
the
interior
of
heaven
there
is
an
unfortunate
doubt
in
this
passage
about
the
meaning
of
the
word
greek
which
is
translated
either
or
and
is
equally
capable
of
both
explanations
a
doubt
may
also
be
raised
as
to
whether
the
words
of
day
and
night
are
consistent
with
the
mere
passive
causation
of
them
produced
by
the
immobility
of
the
earth
in
the
midst
of
the
circling
universe
we
must
admit
further
that
aristotle
attributed
to
plato
the
doctrine
of
the
rotation
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
on
the
other
hand
it
has
been
urged
that
if
the
earth
goes
round
with
the
outer
heaven
and
sun
in
hours
there
is
no
way
of
accounting
for
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
since
the
equal
motion
of
the
earth
and
sun
would
have
the
effect
of
absolute
immobility
to
which
it
may
be
replied
that
plato
never
says
that
the
earth
goes
round
with
the
outer
heaven
and
sun
although
the
whole
question
depends
on
the
relation
of
earth
and
sun
their
movements
are
nowhere
precisely
described
but
if
we
suppose
with
grote
that
the
diurnal
rotation
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
and
the
revolution
of
the
sun
and
outer
heaven
precisely
coincide
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
that
plato
was
unaware
of
the
consequence
for
though
he
was
ignorant
of
many
things
which
are
familiar
to
us
and
often
confused
in
his
ideas
where
we
have
become
clear
we
have
no
right
to
attribute
to
him
a
childish
want
of
reasoning
about
very
simple
facts
or
an
inability
to
understand
the
necessary
and
obvious
deductions
from
geometrical
figures
or
movements
of
the
causes
of
day
and
night
the
philosophers
and
especially
the
pythagoreans
gave
various
accounts
and
therefore
the
question
can
hardly
be
imagined
to
have
escaped
him
on
the
other
hand
it
may
be
urged
that
the
further
step
however
simple
and
obvious
is
just
what
plato
often
seems
to
be
ignorant
of
and
that
as
there
is
no
limit
to
his
insight
there
is
also
no
limit
to
the
blindness
which
sometimes
obscures
his
intelligence
compare
the
construction
of
solids
out
of
surfaces
in
his
account
of
the
creation
of
the
world
or
the
attraction
of
similars
to
similars
further
grote
supposes
not
that
greek
means
or
that
this
is
the
sense
in
which
aristotle
understood
the
word
but
that
the
rotation
of
the
earth
is
necessarily
implied
in
its
adherence
to
the
cosmical
axis
but
a
if
as
mr
grote
assumes
plato
did
not
see
that
the
rotation
of
the
earth
on
its
axis
and
of
the
sun
and
outer
heavens
around
the
earth
in
equal
times
was
inconsistent
with
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
neither
need
we
suppose
that
he
would
have
seen
the
immobility
of
the
earth
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
rotation
of
the
axis
and
b
what
proof
is
there
that
the
axis
of
the
world
revolves
at
all
c
the
comparison
of
the
two
passages
quoted
by
mr
grote
see
his
pamphlet
on
rotation
of
the
earth
from
aristotle
de
coelo
book
ii
greek
clearly
shows
although
this
is
a
matter
of
minor
importance
that
aristotle
as
proclus
and
simplicius
supposed
understood
greek
in
the
timaeus
to
mean
for
the
second
passage
in
which
motion
on
an
axis
is
expressly
mentioned
refers
to
the
first
but
this
would
be
unmeaning
unless
greek
in
the
first
passage
meant
rotation
on
an
axis
the
immobility
of
the
earth
is
more
in
accordance
with
plato
other
writings
than
the
opposite
hypothesis
for
in
the
phaedo
the
earth
is
described
as
the
centre
of
the
world
and
is
not
said
to
be
in
motion
in
the
republic
the
pilgrims
appear
to
be
looking
out
from
the
earth
upon
the
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
in
the
phaedrus
hestia
who
remains
immovable
in
the
house
of
zeus
while
the
other
gods
go
in
procession
is
called
the
first
and
eldest
of
the
gods
and
is
probably
the
symbol
of
the
earth
the
silence
of
plato
in
these
and
in
some
other
passages
laws
in
which
he
might
be
expected
to
speak
of
the
rotation
of
the
earth
is
more
favourable
to
the
doctrine
of
its
immobility
than
to
the
opposite
if
he
had
meant
to
say
that
the
earth
revolves
on
its
axis
he
would
have
said
so
in
distinct
words
and
have
explained
the
relation
of
its
movements
to
those
of
the
other
heavenly
bodies
the
meaning
of
the
words
of
day
and
night
is
literally
true
according
to
plato
view
for
the
alternation
of
day
and
night
is
not
produced
by
the
motion
of
the
heavens
alone
or
by
the
immobility
of
the
earth
alone
but
by
both
together
and
that
which
has
the
inherent
force
or
energy
to
remain
at
rest
when
all
other
bodies
are
moving
may
be
truly
said
to
act
equally
with
them
we
should
not
lay
too
much
stress
on
aristotle
or
the
writer
de
caelo
having
adopted
the
other
interpretation
of
the
words
although
alexander
of
aphrodisias
thinks
that
he
could
not
have
been
ignorant
either
of
the
doctrine
of
plato
or
of
the
sense
which
he
intended
to
give
to
the
word
greek
for
the
citations
of
plato
in
aristotle
are
frequently
misinterpreted
by
him
and
he
seems
hardly
ever
to
have
had
in
his
mind
the
connection
in
which
they
occur
in
this
instance
the
allusion
is
very
slight
and
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
diurnal
revolution
of
the
heavens
was
present
to
his
mind
hence
we
need
not
attribute
to
him
the
error
from
which
we
are
defending
plato
after
weighing
one
against
the
other
all
these
complicated
probabilities
the
final
conclusion
at
which
we
arrive
is
that
there
is
nearly
as
much
to
be
said
on
the
one
side
of
the
question
as
on
the
other
and
that
we
are
not
perfectly
certain
whether
as
bockh
and
the
majority
of
commentators
ancient
as
well
as
modern
are
inclined
to
believe
plato
thought
that
the
earth
was
at
rest
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
or
as
aristotle
and
grote
suppose
that
it
revolved
on
its
axis
whether
we
assume
the
earth
to
be
stationary
in
the
centre
of
the
universe
or
to
revolve
with
the
heavens
no
explanation
is
given
of
the
variation
in
the
length
of
days
and
nights
at
different
times
of
the
year
the
relations
of
the
earth
and
heavens
are
so
indistinct
in
the
timaeus
and
so
figurative
in
the
phaedo
phaedrus
and
republic
that
we
must
give
up
the
hope
of
ascertaining
how
they
were
imagined
by
plato
if
he
had
any
fixed
or
scientific
conception
of
them
at
all
section
the
soul
of
the
world
is
framed
on
the
analogy
of
the
soul
of
man
and
many
traces
of
anthropomorphism
blend
with
plato
highest
flights
of
idealism
the
heavenly
bodies
are
endowed
with
thought
the
principles
of
the
same
and
other
exist
in
the
universe
as
well
as
in
the
human
mind
the
soul
of
man
is
made
out
of
the
remains
of
the
elements
which
had
been
used
in
creating
the
soul
of
the
world
these
remains
however
are
diluted
to
the
third
degree
by
this
plato
expresses
the
measure
of
the
difference
between
the
soul
human
and
divine
the
human
soul
like
the
cosmical
is
framed
before
the
body
as
the
mind
is
before
the
soul
of
either
this
is
the
order
of
the
divine
work
and
the
finer
parts
of
the
body
which
are
more
akin
to
the
soul
such
as
the
spinal
marrow
are
prior
to
the
bones
and
flesh
the
brain
the
containing
vessel
of
the
divine
part
of
the
soul
is
nearly
in
the
form
of
a
globe
which
is
the
image
of
the
gods
who
are
the
stars
and
of
the
universe
there
is
however
an
inconsistency
in
plato
manner
of
conceiving
the
soul
of
man
he
can
not
get
rid
of
the
element
of
necessity
which
is
allowed
to
enter
he
does
not
like
kant
attempt
to
vindicate
for
men
a
freedom
out
of
space
and
time
but
he
acknowledges
him
to
be
subject
to
the
influence
of
external
causes
and
leaves
hardly
any
place
for
freedom
of
the
will
the
lusts
of
men
are
caused
by
their
bodily
constitution
though
they
may
be
increased
by
bad
education
and
bad
laws
which
implies
that
they
may
be
decreased
by
good
education
and
good
laws
he
appears
to
have
an
inkling
of
the
truth
that
to
the
higher
nature
of
man
evil
is
involuntary
this
is
mixed
up
with
the
view
which
while
apparently
agreeing
with
it
is
in
reality
the
opposite
of
it
that
vice
is
due
to
physical
causes
in
the
timaeus
as
well
as
in
the
laws
he
also
regards
vices
and
crimes
as
simply
involuntary
they
are
diseases
analogous
to
the
diseases
of
the
body
and
arising
out
of
the
same
causes
if
we
draw
together
the
opposite
poles
of
plato
system
we
find
that
like
spinoza
he
combines
idealism
with
fatalism
the
soul
of
man
is
divided
by
him
into
three
parts
answering
roughly
to
the
charioteer
and
steeds
of
the
phaedrus
and
to
the
greek
of
the
republic
and
nicomachean
ethics
first
there
is
the
immortal
nature
of
which
the
brain
is
the
seat
and
which
is
akin
to
the
soul
of
the
universe
this
alone
thinks
and
knows
and
is
the
ruler
of
the
whole
secondly
there
is
the
higher
mortal
soul
which
though
liable
to
perturbations
of
her
own
takes
the
side
of
reason
against
the
lower
appetites
the
seat
of
this
is
the
heart
in
which
courage
anger
and
all
the
nobler
affections
are
supposed
to
reside
there
the
veins
all
meet
it
is
their
centre
or
house
of
guard
whence
they
carry
the
orders
of
the
thinking
being
to
the
extremities
of
his
kingdom
there
is
also
a
third
or
appetitive
soul
which
receives
the
commands
of
the
immortal
part
not
immediately
but
mediately
through
the
liver
which
reflects
on
its
surface
the
admonitions
and
threats
of
the
reason
the
liver
is
imagined
by
plato
to
be
a
smooth
and
bright
substance
having
a
store
of
sweetness
and
also
of
bitterness
which
reason
freely
uses
in
the
execution
of
her
mandates
in
this
region
as
ancient
superstition
told
were
to
be
found
intimations
of
the
future
but
plato
is
careful
to
observe
that
although
such
knowledge
is
given
to
the
inferior
parts
of
man
it
requires
to
be
interpreted
by
the
superior
reason
and
not
enthusiasm
is
the
true
guide
of
man
he
is
only
inspired
when
he
is
demented
by
some
distemper
or
possession
the
ancient
saying
that
a
man
in
his
senses
can
judge
of
his
own
actions
is
approved
by
modern
philosophy
too
the
same
irony
which
appears
in
plato
remark
that
men
of
old
time
must
surely
have
known
the
gods
who
were
their
ancestors
and
we
should
believe
them
as
custom
requires
is
also
manifest
in
his
account
of
divination
the
appetitive
soul
is
seated
in
the
belly
and
there
imprisoned
like
a
wild
beast
far
away
from
the
council
chamber
as
plato
graphically
calls
the
head
in
order
that
the
animal
passions
may
not
interfere
with
the
deliberations
of
reason
though
the
soul
is
said
by
him
to
be
prior
to
the
body
yet
we
can
not
help
seeing
that
it
is
constructed
on
the
model
of
the
body
the
threefold
division
into
the
rational
passionate
and
appetitive
corresponding
to
the
head
heart
and
belly
the
human
soul
differs
from
the
soul
of
the
world
in
this
respect
that
it
is
enveloped
and
finds
its
expression
in
matter
whereas
the
soul
of
the
world
is
not
only
enveloped
or
diffused
in
matter
but
is
the
element
in
which
matter
moves
the
breath
of
man
is
within
him
but
the
air
or
aether
of
heaven
is
the
element
which
surrounds
him
and
all
things
pleasure
and
pain
are
attributed
in
the
timaeus
to
the
suddenness
of
our
sensations
the
first
being
a
sudden
restoration
the
second
a
sudden
violation
of
nature
the
sensations
become
conscious
to
us
when
they
are
exceptional
sight
is
not
attended
either
by
pleasure
or
pain
but
hunger
and
the
appeasing
of
hunger
are
pleasant
and
painful
because
they
are
extraordinary
section
i
shall
not
attempt
to
connect
the
physiological
speculations
of
plato
either
with
ancient
or
modern
medicine
what
light
i
can
throw
upon
them
will
be
derived
from
the
comparison
of
them
with
his
general
system
there
is
no
principle
so
apparent
in
the
physics
of
the
timaeus
or
in
ancient
physics
generally
as
that
of
continuity
the
world
is
conceived
of
as
a
whole
and
the
elements
are
formed
into
and
out
of
one
another
the
varieties
of
substances
and
processes
are
hardly
known
or
noticed
and
in
a
similar
manner
the
human
body
is
conceived
of
as
a
whole
and
the
different
substances
of
which
to
a
superficial
observer
it
appears
to
be
composed
the
blood
flesh
sinews
like
the
elements
out
of
which
they
are
formed
are
supposed
to
pass
into
one
another
in
regular
order
while
the
infinite
complexity
of
the
human
frame
remains
unobserved
and
diseases
arise
from
the
opposite
process
when
the
natural
proportions
of
the
four
elements
are
disturbed
and
the
secondary
substances
which
are
formed
out
of
them
namely
blood
flesh
sinews
are
generated
in
an
inverse
order
plato
found
heat
and
air
within
the
human
frame
and
the
blood
circulating
in
every
part
he
assumes
in
language
almost
unintelligible
to
us
that
a
network
of
fire
and
air
envelopes
the
greater
part
of
the
body
this
outer
net
contains
two
lesser
nets
one
corresponding
to
the
stomach
the
other
to
the
lungs
and
the
entrance
to
the
latter
is
forked
or
divided
into
two
passages
which
lead
to
the
nostrils
and
to
the
mouth
in
the
process
of
respiration
the
external
net
is
said
to
find
a
way
in
and
out
of
the
pores
of
the
skin
while
the
interior
of
it
and
the
lesser
nets
move
alternately
into
each
other
the
whole
description
is
figurative
as
plato
himself
implies
when
he
speaks
of
a
of
fire
which
we
compare
to
the
network
of
a
creel
he
really
means
by
this
what
we
should
describe
as
a
state
of
heat
or
temperature
in
the
interior
of
the
body
the
of
fire
or
heat
is
also
in
a
figure
the
circulation
of
the
blood
the
passage
is
partly
imagination
partly
fact
he
has
a
singular
theory
of
respiration
for
which
he
accounts
solely
by
the
movement
of
the
air
in
and
out
of
the
body
he
does
not
attribute
any
part
of
the
process
to
the
action
of
the
body
itself
the
air
has
a
double
ingress
and
a
double
exit
through
the
mouth
or
nostrils
and
through
the
skin
when
exhaled
through
the
mouth
or
nostrils
it
leaves
a
vacuum
which
is
filled
up
by
other
air
finding
a
way
in
through
the
pores
this
air
being
thrust
out
of
its
place
by
the
exhalation
from
the
mouth
and
nostrils
there
is
also
a
corresponding
process
of
inhalation
through
the
mouth
or
nostrils
and
of
exhalation
through
the
pores
the
inhalation
through
the
pores
appears
to
take
place
nearly
at
the
same
time
as
the
exhalation
through
the
mouth
and
conversely
the
internal
fire
is
in
either
case
the
propelling
cause
outwards
the
inhaled
air
when
heated
by
it
having
a
natural
tendency
to
move
out
of
the
body
to
the
place
of
fire
while
the
impossibility
of
a
vacuum
is
the
propelling
cause
inwards
thus
we
see
that
this
singular
theory
is
dependent
on
two
principles
largely
employed
by
plato
in
explaining
the
operations
of
nature
the
impossibility
of
a
vacuum
and
the
attraction
of
like
to
like
to
these
there
has
to
be
added
a
third
principle
which
is
the
condition
of
the
action
of
the
other
two
the
interpenetration
of
particles
in
proportion
to
their
density
or
rarity
it
is
this
which
enables
fire
and
air
to
permeate
the
flesh
plato
account
of
digestion
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
is
closely
connected
with
his
theory
of
respiration
digestion
is
supposed
to
be
effected
by
the
action
of
the
internal
fire
which
in
the
process
of
respiration
moves
into
the
stomach
and
minces
the
food
as
the
fire
returns
to
its
place
it
takes
with
it
the
minced
food
or
blood
and
in
this
way
the
veins
are
replenished
plato
does
not
enquire
how
the
blood
is
separated
from
the
faeces
of
the
anatomy
and
functions
of
the
body
he
knew
very
little
of
the
uses
of
the
nerves
in
conveying
motion
and
sensation
which
he
supposed
to
be
communicated
by
the
bones
and
veins
he
was
also
ignorant
of
the
distinction
between
veins
and
arteries
the
latter
term
he
applies
to
the
vessels
which
conduct
air
from
the
mouth
to
the
lungs
he
supposes
the
lung
to
be
hollow
and
bloodless
the
spinal
marrow
he
conceives
to
be
the
seed
of
generation
he
confuses
the
parts
of
the
body
with
the
states
of
the
body
the
network
of
fire
and
air
is
spoken
of
as
a
bodily
organ
he
has
absolutely
no
idea
of
the
phenomena
of
respiration
which
he
attributes
to
a
law
of
equalization
in
nature
the
air
which
is
breathed
out
displacing
other
air
which
finds
a
way
in
he
is
wholly
unacquainted
with
the
process
of
digestion
except
the
general
divisions
into
the
spleen
the
liver
the
belly
and
the
lungs
and
the
obvious
distinctions
of
flesh
bones
and
the
limbs
of
the
body
we
find
nothing
that
reminds
us
of
anatomical
facts
but
we
find
much
which
is
derived
from
his
theory
of
the
universe
and
transferred
to
man
as
there
is
much
also
in
his
theory
of
the
universe
which
is
suggested
by
man
the
microcosm
of
the
human
body
is
the
lesser
image
of
the
macrocosm
the
courses
of
the
same
and
the
other
affect
both
they
are
made
of
the
same
elements
and
therefore
in
the
same
proportions
both
are
intelligent
natures
endued
with
the
power
of
and
the
same
equipoise
is
maintained
in
both
the
animal
is
a
sort
of
to
the
particles
of
the
blood
which
circulate
in
it
all
the
four
elements
entered
into
the
original
composition
of
the
human
frame
the
bone

formed
out
of
smooth
earth
liquids
of
various
kinds

to
and
fro
the
network
of

and

the

infancy
and
childhood
is
the
chaos
or
first
turbid
flux
of
sense
prior
to
the
establishment
of
order
the
intervals
of
time
which
may
be
observed
in
some
intermittent
fevers
correspond
to
the
density
of
the
elements
the
spinal

including
the
brain
is
formed
out
of
the
finest
sorts
of
triangles
and
is
the
connecting
link
between

health
is
only
to
be
preserved
by
imitating
the
motions
of
the
world
in
space
which
is
the
mother
and
nurse
of

the
work
of

is
carried
on
by
the
superior
sharpness
of
the
triangles
forming
the
substances
of
the
human
body
to
those
which
are
introduced
into
it
in
the

freshest
and
acutest

are

in

but
they
become
more
obtuse
with
advancing
years
and
when
they
finally
wear
out
and
fall
to
pieces
old
age
and
death
supervene
as
in
the
republic
plato
is
still
the
enemy
of
the
purgative
treatment
of
physicians
which
except
in
extreme
cases
no
man
of
sense
will
ever
adopt
for
as
he
adds
with
an
insight
into
the
truth
disease
is
akin
to
the
nature
of
the
living
being
and
is
only
irritated
by
stimulants
he
is
of
opinion
that
nature
should
be
left
to
herself
and
is
inclined
to
think
that
physicians
are
in
vain
laws
where
he
says
that
warm
baths
would
be
more
beneficial
to
the
limbs
of
the
aged
rustic
than
the
prescriptions
of
a
not
doctor
if
he
seems
to
be
extreme
in
his
condemnation
of
medicine
and
to
rely
too
much
on
diet
and
exercise
he
might
appeal
to
nearly
all
the
best
physicians
of
our
own
age
in
support
of
his
opinions
who
often
speak
to
their
patients
of
the
worthlessness
of
drugs
for
we
ourselves
are
sceptical
about
medicine
and
very
unwilling
to
submit
to
the
purgative
treatment
of
physicians
may
we
not
claim
for
plato
an
anticipation
of
modern
ideas
as
about
some
questions
of
astronomy
and
physics
so
also
about
medicine
as
in
the
charmides
he
tells
us
that
the
body
can
not
be
cured
without
the
soul
so
in
the
timaeus
he
strongly
asserts
the
sympathy
of
soul
and
body
any
defect
of
either
is
the
occasion
of
the
greatest
discord
and
disproportion
in
the
other
here
too
may
be
a
presentiment
that
in
the
medicine
of
the
future
the
interdependence
of
mind
and
body
will
be
more
fully
recognized
and
that
the
influence
of
the
one
over
the
other
may
be
exerted
in
a
manner
which
is
not
now
thought
possible
section
in
plato
explanation
of
sensation
we
are
struck
by
the
fact
that
he
has
not
the
same
distinct
conception
of
organs
of
sense
which
is
familiar
to
ourselves
the
senses
are
not
instruments
but
rather
passages
through
which
external
objects
strike
upon
the
mind
the
eye
is
the
aperture
through
which
the
stream
of
vision
passes
the
ear
is
the
aperture
through
which
the
vibrations
of
sound
pass
but
that
the
complex
structure
of
the
eye
or
the
ear
is
in
any
sense
the
cause
of
sight
and
hearing
he
seems
hardly
to
be
aware
the
process
of
sight
is
the
most
complicated
and
consists
of
three
elements
the
light
which
is
supposed
to
reside
within
the
eye
the
light
of
the
sun
and
the
light
emitted
from
external
objects
when
the
light
of
the
eye
meets
the
light
of
the
sun
and
both
together
meet
the
light
issuing
from
an
external
object
this
is
the
simple
act
of
sight
when
the
particles
of
light
which
proceed
from
the
object
are
exactly
equal
to
the
particles
of
the
visual
ray
which
meet
them
from
within
then
the
body
is
transparent
if
they
are
larger
and
contract
the
visual
ray
a
black
colour
is
produced
if
they
are
smaller
and
dilate
it
a
white
other
phenomena
are
produced
by
the
variety
and
motion
of
light
a
sudden
flash
of
fire
at
once
elicits
light
and
moisture
from
the
eye
and
causes
a
bright
colour
a
more
subdued
light
on
mingling
with
the
moisture
of
the
eye
produces
a
red
colour
out
of
these
elements
all
other
colours
are
derived
all
of
them
are
combinations
of
bright
and
red
with
white
and
black
plato
himself
tells
us
that
he
does
not
know
in
what
proportions
they
combine
and
he
is
of
opinion
that
such
knowledge
is
granted
to
the
gods
only
to
have
seen
the
affinity
of
them
to
each
other
and
their
connection
with
light
is
not
a
bad
basis
for
a
theory
of
colours
we
must
remember
that
they
were
not
distinctly
defined
to
his
as
they
are
to
our
eyes
he
saw
them
not
as
they
are
divided
in
the
prism
or
artificially
manufactured
for
the
painter
use
but
as
they
exist
in
nature
blended
and
confused
with
one
another
we
can
hardly
agree
with
him
when
he
tells
us
that
smells
do
not
admit
of
kinds
he
seems
to
think
that
no
definite
qualities
can
attach
to
bodies
which
are
in
a
state
of
transition
or
evaporation
he
also
makes
the
subtle
observation
that
smells
must
be
denser
than
air
though
thinner
than
water
because
when
there
is
an
obstruction
to
the
breathing
air
can
penetrate
but
not
smell
the
affections
peculiar
to
the
tongue
are
of
various
kinds
and
like
many
other
affections
are
caused
by
contraction
and
dilation
some
of
them
are
produced
by
rough
others
by
abstergent
others
by
inflammatory
substances
these
act
upon
the
testing
instruments
of
the
tongue
and
produce
a
more
or
less
disagreeable
sensation
while
other
particles
congenial
to
the
tongue
soften
and
harmonize
them
the
instruments
of
taste
reach
from
the
tongue
to
the
heart
plato
has
a
lively
sense
of
the
manner
in
which
sensation
and
motion
are
communicated
from
one
part
of
the
body
to
the
other
though
he
confuses
the
affections
with
the
organs
hearing
is
a
blow
which
passes
through
the
ear
and
ends
in
the
region
of
the
liver
being
transmitted
by
means
of
the
air
the
brain
and
the
blood
to
the
soul
the
swifter
sound
is
acute
the
sound
which
moves
slowly
is
grave
a
great
body
of
sound
is
loud
the
opposite
is
low
discord
is
produced
by
the
swifter
and
slower
motions
of
two
sounds
and
is
converted
into
harmony
when
the
swifter
motions
begin
to
pause
and
are
overtaken
by
the
slower
the
general
phenomena
of
sensation
are
partly
internal
but
the
more
violent
are
caused
by
conflict
with
external
objects
proceeding
by
a
method
of
superficial
observation
plato
remarks
that
the
more
sensitive
parts
of
the
human
frame
are
those
which
are
least
covered
by
flesh
as
is
the
case
with
the
head
and
the
elbows
man
if
his
head
had
been
covered
with
a
thicker
pulp
of
flesh
might
have
been
a
animal
than
he
is
but
could
not
have
had
as
quick
perceptions
on
the
other
hand
the
tongue
is
one
of
the
most
sensitive
of
organs
but
then
this
is
made
not
to
be
a
covering
to
the
bones
which
contain
the
marrow
or
source
of
life
but
with
an
express
purpose
and
in
a
separate
mass
section
we
have
now
to
consider
how
far
in
any
of
these
speculations
plato
approximated
to
the
discoveries
of
modern
science
the
modern
physical
philosopher
is
apt
to
dwell
exclusively
on
the
absurdities
of
ancient
ideas
about
science
on
the
haphazard
fancies
and
a
priori
assumptions
of
ancient
teachers
on
their
confusion
of
facts
and
ideas
on
their
inconsistency
and
blindness
to
the
most
obvious
phenomena
he
measures
them
not
by
what
preceded
them
but
by
what
has
followed
them
he
does
not
consider
that
ancient
physical
philosophy
was
not
a
free
enquiry
but
a
growth
in
which
the
mind
was
passive
rather
than
active
and
was
incapable
of
resisting
the
impressions
which
flowed
in
upon
it
he
hardly
allows
to
the
notions
of
the
ancients
the
merit
of
being
the
by
which
he
has
himself
risen
to
a
higher
knowledge
he
never
reflects
how
great
a
thing
it
was
to
have
formed
a
conception
however
imperfect
either
of
the
human
frame
as
a
whole
or
of
the
world
as
a
whole
according
to
the
view
taken
in
these
volumes
the
errors
of
ancient
physicists
were
not
separable
from
the
intellectual
conditions
under
which
they
lived
their
genius
was
their
own
and
they
were
not
the
rash
and
hasty
generalizers
which
since
the
days
of
bacon
we
have
been
apt
to
suppose
them
the
thoughts
of
men
widened
to
receive
experience
at
first
they
seemed
to
know
all
things
as
in
a
dream
after
a
while
they
look
at
them
closely
and
hold
them
in
their
hands
they
begin
to
arrange
them
in
classes
and
to
connect
causes
with
effects
general
notions
are
necessary
to
the
apprehension
of
particular
facts
the
metaphysical
to
the
physical
before
men
can
observe
the
world
they
must
be
able
to
conceive
it
to
do
justice
to
the
subject
we
should
consider
the
physical
philosophy
of
the
ancients
as
a
whole
we
should
remember
that
the
nebular
theory
was
the
received
belief
of
several
of
the
early
physicists
that
the
development
of
animals
out
of
fishes
who
came
to
land
and
of
man
out
of
the
animals
was
held
by
anaximander
in
the
sixth
century
before
christ
plut
symp
quaest
plac
phil
that
even
by
philolaus
and
the
early
pythagoreans
the
earth
was
held
to
be
a
body
like
the
other
stars
revolving
in
space
around
the
sun
or
a
central
fire
that
the
beginnings
of
chemistry
are
discernible
in
the
particles
of
anaxagoras
also
they
knew
or
thought
that
there
was
a
sex
in
plants
as
well
as
in
animals
they
were
aware
that
musical
notes
depended
on
the
relative
length
or
tension
of
the
strings
from
which
they
were
emitted
and
were
measured
by
ratios
of
number
that
mathematical
laws
pervaded
the
world
and
even
qualitative
differences
were
supposed
to
have
their
origin
in
number
and
figure
the
annihilation
of
matter
was
denied
by
several
of
them
and
the
seeming
disappearance
of
it
held
to
be
a
transformation
only
for
although
one
of
these
discoveries
might
have
been
supposed
to
be
a
happy
guess
taken
together
they
seem
to
imply
a
great
advance
and
almost
maturity
of
natural
knowledge
we
should
also
remember
when
we
attribute
to
the
ancients
hasty
generalizations
and
delusions
of
language
that
physical
philosophy
and
metaphysical
too
have
been
guilty
of
similar
fallacies
in
quite
recent
times
we
by
no
means
distinguish
clearly
between
mind
and
body
between
ideas
and
facts
have
not
many
discussions
arisen
about
the
atomic
theory
in
which
a
point
has
been
confused
with
a
material
atom
have
not
the
natures
of
things
been
explained
by
imaginary
entities
such
as
life
or
phlogiston
which
exist
in
the
mind
only
has
not
disease
been
regarded
like
sin
sometimes
as
a
negative
and
necessary
sometimes
as
a
positive
or
malignant
principle
the
of
bacon
are
nearly
as
common
now
as
ever
they
are
inherent
in
the
human
mind
and
when
they
have
the
most
complete
dominion
over
us
we
are
least
able
to
perceive
them
we
recognize
them
in
the
ancients
but
we
fail
to
see
them
in
ourselves
such
reflections
although
this
is
not
the
place
in
which
to
dwell
upon
them
at
length
lead
us
to
take
a
favourable
view
of
the
speculations
of
the
timaeus
we
should
consider
not
how
much
plato
actually
knew
but
how
far
he
has
contributed
to
the
general
ideas
of
physics
or
supplied
the
notions
which
whether
true
or
false
have
stimulated
the
minds
of
later
generations
in
the
path
of
discovery
some
of
them
may
seem
but
may
nevertheless
have
had
a
great
influence
in
promoting
system
and
assisting
enquiry
while
in
others
we
hear
the
latest
word
of
physical
or
metaphysical
philosophy
there
is
also
an
intermediate
class
in
which
plato
falls
short
of
the
truths
of
modern
science
though
he
is
not
wholly
unacquainted
with
them
to
the
first
class
belongs
the
teleological
theory
of
creation
whether
all
things
in
the
world
can
be
explained
as
the
result
of
natural
laws
or
whether
we
must
not
admit
of
tendencies
and
marks
of
design
also
has
been
a
question
much
disputed
of
late
years
even
if
all
phenomena
are
the
result
of
natural
forces
we
must
admit
that
there
are
many
things
in
heaven
and
earth
which
are
as
well
expressed
under
the
image
of
mind
or
design
as
under
any
other
at
any
rate
the
language
of
plato
has
been
the
language
of
natural
theology
down
to
our
own
time
nor
can
any
description
of
the
world
wholly
dispense
with
it
the
notion
of
first
and
second
or
causes
which
originally
appears
in
the
timaeus
has
likewise
survived
to
our
own
day
and
has
been
a
great
between
theology
and
science
plato
also
approaches
very
near
to
our
doctrine
of
the
primary
and
secondary
qualities
of
matter
another
popular
notion
which
is
found
in
the
timaeus
is
the
feebleness
of
the
human
intellect
knows
the
original
qualities
of
things
man
can
only
hope
to
attain
to
probability
we
speak
in
almost
the
same
words
of
human
intelligence
but
not
in
the
same
manner
of
the
uncertainty
of
our
knowledge
of
nature
the
reason
is
that
the
latter
is
assured
to
us
by
experiment
and
is
not
contrasted
with
the
certainty
of
ideal
or
mathematical
knowledge
but
the
ancient
philosopher
never
experimented
in
the
timaeus
plato
seems
to
have
thought
that
there
would
be
impiety
in
making
the
attempt
he
for
example
who
tried
experiments
in
colours
would
the
difference
of
the
human
and
divine
natures
their
indefiniteness
is
probably
the
reason
why
he
singles
them
out
as
especially
incapable
of
being
tested
by
experiment
compare
the
saying
of
anaxagoras
sext
that
since
snow
is
made
of
water
and
water
is
black
snow
ought
to
be
black
the
greatest
of
the
ancients
was
the
supremacy
which
they
assigned
to
mathematics
in
all
the
realms
of
nature
for
in
all
of
them
there
is
a
foundation
of
mechanics
even
physiology
partakes
of
figure
and
number
and
plato
is
not
wrong
in
attributing
them
to
the
human
frame
but
in
the
omission
to
observe
how
little
could
be
explained
by
them
thus
we
may
remark
in
passing
that
the
most
fanciful
of
ancient
philosophies
is
also
the
most
nearly
verified
in
fact
the
fortunate
guess
that
the
world
is
a
sum
of
numbers
and
figures
has
been
the
most
fruitful
of
anticipations
the
scale
of
the
pythagoreans
and
plato
suggested
to
kepler
that
the
secret
of
the
distances
of
the
planets
from
one
another
was
to
be
found
in
mathematical
proportions
the
doctrine
that
the
heavenly
bodies
all
move
in
a
circle
is
known
by
us
to
be
erroneous
but
without
such
an
error
how
could
the
human
mind
have
comprehended
the
heavens
astronomy
even
in
modern
times
has
made
far
greater
progress
by
the
high
a
priori
road
than
could
have
been
attained
by
any
other
yet
strictly
speaking
and
the
remark
applies
to
ancient
physics
generally
this
high
a
priori
road
was
based
upon
a
posteriori
grounds
for
there
were
no
facts
of
which
the
ancients
were
so
well
assured
by
experience
as
facts
of
number
having
observed
that
they
held
good
in
a
few
instances
they
applied
them
everywhere
and
in
the
complexity
of
which
they
were
capable
found
the
explanation
of
the
equally
complex
phenomena
of
the
universe
they
seemed
to
see
them
in
the
least
things
as
well
as
in
the
greatest
in
atoms
as
well
as
in
suns
and
stars
in
the
human
body
as
well
as
in
external
nature
and
now
a
favourite
speculation
of
modern
chemistry
is
the
explanation
of
qualitative
difference
by
quantitative
which
is
at
present
verified
to
a
certain
extent
and
may
hereafter
be
of
far
more
universal
application
what
is
this
but
the
atoms
of
democritus
and
the
triangles
of
plato
the
ancients
should
not
be
wholly
deprived
of
the
credit
of
their
guesses
because
they
were
unable
to
prove
them
may
they
not
have
had
like
the
animals
an
instinct
of
something
more
than
they
knew
besides
general
notions
we
seem
to
find
in
the
timaeus
some
more
precise
approximations
to
the
discoveries
of
modern
physical
science
first
the
doctrine
of
equipoise
plato
affirms
almost
in
so
many
words
that
nature
abhors
a
vacuum
whenever
a
particle
is
displaced
the
rest
push
and
thrust
one
another
until
equality
is
restored
we
must
remember
that
these
ideas
were
not
derived
from
any
definite
experiment
but
were
the
original
reflections
of
man
fresh
from
the
first
observation
of
nature
the
latest
word
of
modern
philosophy
is
continuity
and
development
but
to
plato
this
is
the
beginning
and
foundation
of
science
there
is
nothing
that
he
is
so
strongly
persuaded
of
as
that
the
world
is
one
and
that
all
the
various
existences
which
are
contained
in
it
are
only
the
transformations
of
the
same
soul
of
the
world
acting
on
the
same
matter
he
would
have
readily
admitted
that
out
of
the
protoplasm
all
things
were
formed
by
the
gradual
process
of
creation
but
he
would
have
insisted
that
mind
and
intelligence
not
meaning
by
this
however
a
conscious
mind
or
person
were
prior
to
them
and
could
alone
have
created
them
into
the
workings
of
this
eternal
mind
or
intelligence
he
does
not
enter
further
nor
would
there
have
been
any
use
in
attempting
to
investigate
the
things
which
no
eye
has
seen
nor
any
human
language
can
express
lastly
there
remain
two
points
in
which
he
seems
to
touch
great
discoveries
of
modern
times
the
law
of
gravitation
and
the
circulation
of
the
blood
the
law
of
gravitation
according
to
plato
is
a
law
not
only
of
the
attraction
of
lesser
bodies
to
larger
ones
but
of
similar
bodies
to
similar
having
a
magnetic
power
as
well
as
a
principle
of
gravitation
he
observed
that
earth
water
and
air
had
settled
down
to
their
places
and
he
imagined
fire
or
the
exterior
aether
to
have
a
place
beyond
air
when
air
seemed
to
go
upwards
and
fire
to
pierce
through
air
when
water
and
earth
fell
downward
they
were
seeking
their
native
elements
he
did
not
remark
that
his
own
explanation
did
not
suit
all
phenomena
and
the
simpler
explanation
which
assigns
to
bodies
degrees
of
heaviness
and
lightness
proportioned
to
the
mass
and
distance
of
the
bodies
which
attract
them
never
occurred
to
him
yet
the
affinities
of
similar
substances
have
some
effect
upon
the
composition
of
the
world
and
of
this
plato
may
be
thought
to
have
had
an
anticipation
he
may
be
described
as
confusing
the
attraction
of
gravitation
with
the
attraction
of
cohesion
the
influence
of
such
affinities
and
the
chemical
action
of
one
body
upon
another
in
long
periods
of
time
have
become
a
recognized
principle
of
geology
plato
is
perfectly
aware
and
he
could
hardly
be
ignorant
that
blood
is
a
fluid
in
constant
motion
he
also
knew
that
blood
is
partly
a
solid
substance
consisting
of
several
elements
which
as
he
might
have
observed
in
the
use
of
decompose
and
die
when
no
longer
in
motion
but
the
specific
discovery
that
the
blood
flows
out
on
one
side
of
the
heart
through
the
arteries
and
returns
through
the
veins
on
the
other
which
is
commonly
called
the
circulation
of
the
blood
was
absolutely
unknown
to
him
a
further
study
of
the
timaeus
suggests
some
which
may
be
conveniently
brought
together
in
this
place
the
topics
which
i
propose
briefly
to
reconsider
are
a
the
relation
of
the
timaeus
to
the
other
dialogues
of
plato
and
to
the
previous
philosophy
b
the
nature
of
god
and
of
creation
c
the
morality
of
the
timaeus
a
the
timaeus
is
more
imaginative
and
less
scientific
than
any
other
of
the
platonic
dialogues
it
is
conjectural
astronomy
conjectural
natural
philosophy
conjectural
medicine
the
writer
himself
is
constantly
repeating
that
he
is
speaking
what
is
probable
only
the
dialogue
is
put
into
the
mouth
of
timaeus
a
pythagorean
philosopher
and
therefore
here
as
in
the
parmenides
we
are
in
doubt
how
far
plato
is
expressing
his
own
sentiments
hence
the
connexion
with
the
other
dialogues
is
comparatively
slight
we
may
fill
up
the
lacunae
of
the
timaeus
by
the
help
of
the
republic
or
phaedrus
we
may
identify
the
same
and
other
with
the
greek
of
the
philebus
we
may
find
in
the
laws
or
in
the
statesman
parallels
with
the
account
of
creation
and
of
the
first
origin
of
man
it
would
be
possible
to
frame
a
scheme
in
which
all
these
various
elements
might
have
a
place
but
such
a
mode
of
proceeding
would
be
unsatisfactory
because
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
plato
intended
his
scattered
thoughts
to
be
collected
in
a
system
there
is
a
common
spirit
in
his
writings
and
there
are
certain
general
principles
such
as
the
opposition
of
the
sensible
and
intellectual
and
the
priority
of
mind
which
run
through
all
of
them
but
he
has
no
definite
forms
of
words
in
which
he
consistently
expresses
himself
while
the
determinations
of
human
thought
are
in
process
of
creation
he
is
necessarily
tentative
and
uncertain
and
there
is
least
of
definiteness
whenever
either
in
describing
the
beginning
or
the
end
of
the
world
he
has
recourse
to
myths
these
are
not
the
fixed
modes
in
which
spiritual
truths
are
revealed
to
him
but
the
efforts
of
imagination
by
which
at
different
times
and
in
various
manners
he
seeks
to
embody
his
conceptions
the
clouds
of
mythology
are
still
resting
upon
him
and
he
has
not
yet
pierced
the
heaven
of
the
fixed
stars
which
is
beyond
them
it
is
safer
then
to
admit
the
inconsistencies
of
the
timaeus
or
to
endeavour
to
fill
up
what
is
wanting
from
our
own
imagination
inspired
by
a
study
of
the
dialogue
than
to
refer
to
other
platonic
writings
and
still
less
should
we
refer
to
the
successors
of
plato
for
the
elucidation
of
it
more
light
is
thrown
upon
the
timaeus
by
a
comparison
of
the
previous
philosophies
for
the
physical
science
of
the
ancients
was
traditional
descending
through
many
generations
of
ionian
and
pythagorean
philosophers
plato
does
not
look
out
upon
the
heavens
and
describe
what
he
sees
in
them
but
he
builds
upon
the
foundations
of
others
adding
something
out
of
the
of
his
own
socrates
had
already
spoken
of
god
the
creator
who
made
all
things
for
the
best
while
he
ridiculed
the
superficial
explanations
of
phenomena
which
were
current
in
his
age
he
recognised
the
marks
both
of
benevolence
and
of
design
in
the
frame
of
man
and
in
the
world
the
apparatus
of
winds
and
waters
is
contemptuously
rejected
by
him
in
the
phaedo
but
he
thinks
that
there
is
a
power
greater
than
that
of
any
atlas
in
the
phaedo
arist
plato
following
his
master
affirms
this
principle
of
the
best
but
he
acknowledges
that
the
best
is
limited
by
the
conditions
of
matter
in
the
generation
before
socrates
anaxagoras
had
brought
together
and
and
these
are
connected
by
plato
in
the
timaeus
but
in
accordance
with
his
own
mode
of
thinking
he
has
interposed
between
them
the
idea
or
pattern
according
to
which
mind
worked
the
circular
impulse
greek
of
the
one
philosopher
answers
to
the
circular
movement
greek
of
the
other
but
unlike
anaxagoras
plato
made
the
sun
and
stars
living
beings
and
not
masses
of
earth
or
metal
the
pythagoreans
again
had
framed
a
world
out
of
numbers
which
they
constructed
into
figures
plato
adopted
their
speculations
and
improved
upon
them
by
a
more
exact
knowledge
of
geometry
the
atomists
too
made
the
world
if
not
out
of
geometrical
figures
at
least
out
of
different
forms
of
atoms
and
these
atoms
resembled
the
triangles
of
plato
in
being
too
small
to
be
visible
but
though
the
physiology
of
the
timaeus
is
partly
borrowed
from
them
they
are
either
ignored
by
plato
or
referred
to
with
a
secret
contempt
and
dislike
he
looks
with
more
favour
on
the
pythagoreans
whose
intervals
of
number
applied
to
the
distances
of
the
planets
reappear
in
the
timaeus
it
is
probable
that
among
the
pythagoreans
living
in
the
fourth
century
there
were
already
some
who
like
plato
made
the
earth
their
centre
whether
he
obtained
his
circles
of
the
same
and
other
from
any
previous
thinker
is
uncertain
the
four
elements
are
taken
from
empedocles
the
interstices
of
the
timaeus
may
also
be
compared
with
his
greek
the
passage
of
one
element
into
another
is
common
to
heracleitus
and
several
of
the
ionian
philosophers
so
much
of
a
syncretist
is
plato
though
not
after
the
manner
of
the
neoplatonists
for
the
elements
which
he
borrows
from
others
are
fused
and
transformed
by
his
own
genius
on
the
other
hand
we
find
fewer
traces
in
plato
of
early
ionic
or
eleatic
speculation
he
does
not
imagine
the
world
of
sense
to
be
made
up
of
opposites
or
to
be
in
a
perpetual
flux
but
to
vary
within
certain
limits
which
are
controlled
by
what
he
calls
the
principle
of
the
same
unlike
the
eleatics
who
relegated
the
world
to
the
sphere
of
he
admits
creation
to
have
an
existence
which
is
real
and
even
eternal
although
dependent
on
the
will
of
the
creator
instead
of
maintaining
the
doctrine
that
the
void
has
a
necessary
place
in
the
existence
of
the
world
he
rather
affirms
the
modern
thesis
that
nature
abhors
a
vacuum
as
in
the
sophist
he
also
denies
the
reality
of
aristot
but
though
in
these
respects
he
differs
from
them
he
is
deeply
penetrated
by
the
spirit
of
their
philosophy
he
differs
from
them
with
reluctance
and
gladly
recognizes
the
depth
of
parmenides
there
is
a
similarity
between
the
timaeus
and
the
fragments
of
philolaus
which
by
some
has
been
thought
to
be
so
great
as
to
create
a
suspicion
that
they
are
derived
from
it
philolaus
is
known
to
us
from
the
phaedo
of
plato
as
a
pythagorean
philosopher
residing
at
thebes
in
the
latter
half
of
the
fifth
century
after
the
dispersion
of
the
original
pythagorean
society
he
was
the
teacher
of
simmias
and
cebes
who
became
disciples
of
socrates
we
have
hardly
any
other
information
about
him
the
story
that
plato
had
purchased
three
books
of
his
writings
from
a
relation
is
not
worth
repeating
it
is
only
a
fanciful
way
in
which
an
ancient
biographer
dresses
up
the
fact
that
there
was
supposed
to
be
a
resemblance
between
the
two
writers
similar
gossiping
stories
are
told
about
the
sources
of
the
republic
and
the
phaedo
that
there
really
existed
in
antiquity
a
work
passing
under
the
name
of
philolaus
there
can
be
no
doubt
fragments
of
this
work
are
preserved
to
us
chiefly
in
stobaeus
a
few
in
boethius
and
other
writers
they
remind
us
of
the
timaeus
as
well
as
of
the
phaedrus
and
philebus
when
the
writer
says
stob
eclog
that
all
things
are
either
finite
definite
or
infinite
indefinite
or
a
union
of
the
two
and
that
this
antithesis
and
synthesis
pervades
all
art
and
nature
we
are
reminded
of
the
philebus
when
he
calls
the
centre
of
the
world
greek
we
have
a
parallel
to
the
phaedrus
his
distinction
between
the
world
of
order
to
which
the
sun
and
moon
and
the
stars
belong
and
the
world
of
disorder
which
lies
in
the
region
between
the
moon
and
the
earth
approximates
to
plato
sphere
of
the
same
and
of
the
other
like
plato
tim
he
denied
the
above
and
below
in
space
and
said
that
all
things
were
the
same
in
relation
to
a
centre
he
speaks
also
of
the
world
as
one
and
indestructible
neither
from
within
nor
from
without
does
it
admit
of
destruction
tim
he
mentions
ten
heavenly
bodies
including
the
sun
and
moon
the
earth
and
the
greek
and
in
the
midst
of
them
all
he
places
the
central
fire
around
which
they
are
moving
this
is
hidden
from
the
earth
by
the
of
neither
is
there
any
trace
in
plato
who
makes
the
earth
the
centre
of
his
system
philolaus
magnifies
the
virtues
of
particular
numbers
especially
of
the
number
stob
eclog
and
descants
upon
odd
and
even
numbers
after
the
manner
of
the
later
pythagoreans
it
is
worthy
of
remark
that
these
mystical
fancies
are
nowhere
to
be
found
in
the
writings
of
plato
although
the
importance
of
number
as
a
form
and
also
an
instrument
of
thought
is
ever
present
to
his
mind
both
philolaus
and
plato
agree
in
making
the
world
move
in
certain
numerical
ratios
according
to
a
musical
scale
though
bockh
is
of
opinion
that
the
two
scales
of
philolaus
and
of
the
timaeus
do
not
correspond
we
appear
not
to
be
sufficiently
acquainted
with
the
early
pythagoreans
to
know
how
far
the
statements
contained
in
these
fragments
corresponded
with
their
doctrines
and
we
therefore
can
not
pronounce
either
in
favour
of
the
genuineness
of
the
fragments
with
bockh
and
zeller
or
with
valentine
rose
and
schaarschmidt
against
them
but
it
is
clear
that
they
throw
but
little
light
upon
the
timaeus
and
that
their
resemblance
to
it
has
been
exaggerated
that
there
is
a
degree
of
confusion
and
indistinctness
in
account
both
of
man
and
of
the
universe
has
been
already
acknowledged
we
can
not
tell
nor
could
plato
himself
have
told
where
the
figure
or
myth
ends
and
the
philosophical
truth
begins
we
can
not
explain
nor
could
plato
himself
have
explained
to
us
the
relation
of
the
ideas
to
appearance
of
which
one
is
the
copy
of
the
other
and
yet
of
all
things
in
the
world
they
are
the
most
opposed
and
unlike
this
opposition
is
presented
to
us
in
many
forms
as
the
antithesis
of
the
one
and
many
of
the
finite
and
infinite
of
the
intelligible
and
sensible
of
the
unchangeable
and
the
changing
of
the
indivisible
and
the
divisible
of
the
fixed
stars
and
the
planets
of
the
creative
mind
and
the
primeval
chaos
these
pairs
of
opposites
are
so
many
aspects
of
the
great
opposition
between
ideas
and
phenomena
they
easily
pass
into
one
another
and
sometimes
the
two
members
of
the
relation
differ
in
kind
sometimes
only
in
degree
as
in
aristotle
matter
and
form
the
connexion
between
them
is
really
inseparable
for
if
we
attempt
to
separate
them
they
become
devoid
of
content
and
therefore
indistinguishable
there
is
no
difference
between
the
idea
of
which
nothing
can
be
predicated
and
the
chaos
or
matter
which
has
no
perceptible
qualities
between
being
in
the
abstract
and
nothing
yet
we
are
frequently
told
that
the
one
class
of
them
is
the
reality
and
the
other
appearance
and
one
is
often
spoken
of
as
the
double
or
reflection
of
the
other
for
plato
never
clearly
saw
that
both
elements
had
an
equal
place
in
mind
and
in
nature
and
hence
especially
when
we
argue
from
isolated
passages
in
his
writings
or
attempt
to
draw
what
appear
to
us
to
be
the
natural
inferences
from
them
we
are
full
of
perplexity
there
is
a
similar
confusion
about
necessity
and
and
about
the
state
of
the
soul
after
death
also
he
sometimes
supposes
that
god
is
immanent
in
the
world
sometimes
that
he
is
transcendent
and
having
no
distinction
of
objective
and
subjective
he
passes
imperceptibly
from
one
to
the
other
from
intelligence
to
soul
from
eternity
to
time
these
contradictions
may
be
softened
or
concealed
by
a
judicious
use
of
language
but
they
can
not
be
wholly
got
rid
of
that
an
age
of
intellectual
transition
must
also
be
one
of
inconsistency
that
the
creative
is
opposed
to
the
critical
or
defining
habit
of
mind
or
time
has
been
often
repeated
by
us
but
as
plato
would
say
is
no
harm
in
repeating
twice
or
thrice
laws
what
is
important
for
the
understanding
of
a
great
author
it
has
not
however
been
observed
that
the
confusion
partly
arises
out
of
the
elements
of
opposing
philosophies
which
are
preserved
in
him
he
holds
these
in
solution
he
brings
them
into
relation
with
one
another
but
he
does
not
perfectly
harmonize
them
they
are
part
of
his
own
mind
and
he
is
incapable
of
placing
himself
outside
of
them
and
criticizing
them
they
grow
as
he
grows
they
are
a
kind
of
composition
with
which
his
own
philosophy
is
overlaid
in
early
life
he
fancies
that
he
has
mastered
them
but
he
is
also
mastered
by
them
and
in
language
sophist
which
may
be
compared
with
the
hesitating
tone
of
the
timaeus
he
confesses
in
his
later
years
that
they
are
full
of
obscurity
to
him
he
attributes
new
meanings
to
the
words
of
parmenides
and
heracleitus
but
at
times
the
old
eleatic
philosophy
appears
to
go
beyond
him
then
the
world
of
phenomena
disappears
but
the
doctrine
of
ideas
is
also
reduced
to
nothingness
all
of
them
are
nearer
to
one
another
than
they
themselves
supposed
and
nearer
to
him
than
he
supposed
all
of
them
are
antagonistic
to
sense
and
have
an
affinity
to
number
and
measure
and
a
presentiment
of
ideas
even
in
plato
they
still
retain
their
contentious
or
controversial
character
which
was
developed
by
the
growth
of
dialectic
he
is
never
able
to
reconcile
the
first
causes
of
the
philosophers
with
the
final
causes
of
socrates
himself
there
is
no
intelligible
account
of
the
relation
of
numbers
to
the
universal
ideas
or
of
universals
to
the
idea
of
good
he
found
them
all
three
in
the
pythagorean
philosophy
and
in
the
teaching
of
socrates
and
of
the
megarians
respectively
and
because
they
all
furnished
modes
of
explaining
and
arranging
phenomena
he
is
unwilling
to
give
up
any
of
them
though
he
is
unable
to
unite
them
in
a
consistent
whole
lastly
plato
though
an
idealist
philosopher
is
greek
and
not
oriental
in
spirit
and
feeling
he
is
no
mystic
or
ascetic
he
is
not
seeking
in
vain
to
get
rid
of
matter
or
to
find
absorption
in
the
divine
nature
or
in
the
soul
of
the
universe
and
therefore
we
are
not
surprised
to
find
that
his
philosophy
in
the
timaeus
returns
at
last
to
a
worship
of
the
heavens
and
that
to
him
as
to
other
greeks
nature
though
containing
a
remnant
of
evil
is
still
glorious
and
divine
he
takes
away
or
drops
the
veil
of
mythology
and
presents
her
to
us
in
what
appears
to
him
to
be
the
and
truer
far
of
mathematical
figures
it
is
this
element
in
the
timaeus
no
less
than
its
affinity
to
certain
pythagorean
speculations
which
gives
it
a
character
not
wholly
in
accordance
with
the
other
dialogues
of
plato
b
the
timaeus
contains
an
assertion
perhaps
more
distinct
than
is
found
in
any
of
the
other
dialogues
laws
of
the
goodness
of
god
was
good
himself
and
he
fashioned
the
good
everywhere
he
was
not
jealous
god
and
therefore
he
desired
that
all
other
things
should
be
equally
good
he
is
the
idea
of
good
who
has
now
become
a
person
and
speaks
and
is
spoken
of
as
god
yet
his
personality
seems
to
appear
only
in
the
act
of
creation
in
so
far
as
he
works
with
his
eye
fixed
upon
an
eternal
pattern
he
is
like
the
human
artificer
in
the
republic
here
the
theory
of
platonic
ideas
intrudes
upon
us
god
like
man
is
supposed
to
have
an
ideal
of
which
plato
is
unable
to
tell
us
the
origin
he
may
be
said
in
the
language
of
modern
philosophy
to
resolve
the
divine
mind
into
subject
and
object
the
first
work
of
creation
is
perfected
the
second
begins
under
the
direction
of
inferior
ministers
the
supreme
god
is
withdrawn
from
the
world
and
returns
to
his
own
accustomed
nature
as
in
the
statesman
he
retires
to
his
place
of
view
so
early
did
the
epicurean
doctrine
take
possession
of
the
greek
mind
and
so
natural
is
it
to
the
heart
of
man
when
he
has
once
passed
out
of
the
stage
of
mythology
into
that
of
rational
religion
for
he
sees
the
marks
of
design
in
the
world
but
he
no
longer
sees
or
fancies
that
he
sees
god
walking
in
the
garden
or
haunting
stream
or
mountain
he
feels
also
that
he
must
put
god
as
far
as
possible
out
of
the
way
of
evil
and
therefore
he
banishes
him
from
an
evil
world
plato
is
sensible
of
the
difficulty
and
he
often
shows
that
he
is
desirous
of
justifying
the
ways
of
god
to
man
yet
on
the
other
hand
in
the
tenth
book
of
the
laws
he
passes
a
censure
on
those
who
say
that
the
gods
have
no
care
of
human
things
the
creation
of
the
world
is
the
impression
of
order
on
a
previously
existing
chaos
the
formula
of
anaxagoras
things
were
in
chaos
or
confusion
and
then
mind
came
and
disposed
them
is
a
summary
of
the
first
part
of
the
timaeus
it
is
true
that
of
a
chaos
without
differences
no
idea
could
be
formed
all
was
not
mixed
but
one
and
therefore
it
was
not
difficult
for
the
later
platonists
to
draw
inferences
by
which
they
were
enabled
to
reconcile
the
narrative
of
the
timaeus
with
the
mosaic
account
of
the
creation
neither
when
we
speak
of
mind
or
intelligence
do
we
seem
to
get
much
further
in
our
conception
than
circular
motion
which
was
deemed
to
be
the
most
perfect
plato
like
anaxagoras
while
commencing
his
theory
of
the
universe
with
ideas
of
mind
and
of
the
best
is
compelled
in
the
execution
of
his
design
to
condescend
to
the
crudest
physics
c
the
morality
of
the
timaeus
is
singular
and
it
is
difficult
to
adjust
the
balance
between
the
two
elements
of
it
the
difficulty
which
plato
feels
is
that
which
all
of
us
feel
and
which
is
increased
in
our
own
day
by
the
progress
of
physical
science
how
the
responsibility
of
man
is
to
be
reconciled
with
his
dependence
on
natural
causes
and
sometimes
like
other
men
he
is
more
impressed
by
one
aspect
of
human
life
sometimes
by
the
other
in
the
republic
he
represents
man
as
freely
choosing
his
own
lot
in
a
state
prior
to
birth
a
conception
which
if
taken
literally
would
still
leave
him
subject
to
the
dominion
of
necessity
in
his
after
life
in
the
statesman
he
supposes
the
human
race
to
be
preserved
in
the
world
only
by
a
divine
interposition
while
in
the
timaeus
the
supreme
god
commissions
the
inferior
deities
to
avert
from
him
all
but
evils
words
which
imply
that
all
the
evils
of
men
are
really
and
here
like
plato
the
insertion
of
a
note
in
the
text
of
an
ancient
writer
is
a
literary
curiosity
worthy
of
remark
we
may
take
occasion
to
correct
an
error
for
we
too
hastily
said
that
plato
in
the
timaeus
regarded
all
and
crimes
as
involuntary
but
the
fact
is
that
he
is
inconsistent
with
himself
in
one
and
the
same
passage
vice
is
attributed
to
the
relaxation
of
the
bodily
frame
and
yet
we
are
exhorted
to
avoid
it
and
pursue
virtue
it
is
also
admitted
that
good
and
evil
conduct
are
to
be
attributed
respectively
to
good
and
evil
laws
and
institutions
these
can
not
be
given
by
individuals
to
themselves
and
therefore
human
actions
in
so
far
as
they
are
dependent
upon
them
are
regarded
by
plato
as
involuntary
rather
than
voluntary
like
other
writers
on
this
subject
he
is
unable
to
escape
from
some
degree
of
he
had
learned
from
socrates
that
vice
is
ignorance
and
suddenly
the
doctrine
seems
to
him
to
be
confirmed
by
observing
how
much
of
the
good
and
bad
in
human
character
depends
on
the
bodily
constitution
so
in
modern
times
the
speculative
doctrine
of
necessity
has
often
been
supported
by
physical
facts
the
timaeus
also
contains
an
anticipation
of
the
stoical
life
according
to
nature
man
contemplating
the
heavens
is
to
regulate
his
erring
life
according
to
them
he
is
to
partake
of
the
repose
of
nature
and
of
the
order
of
nature
to
bring
the
variable
principle
in
himself
into
harmony
with
the
principle
of
the
same
the
ethics
of
the
timaeus
may
be
summed
up
in
the
single
idea
of
to
feel
habitually
that
he
is
part
of
the
order
of
the
universe
is
one
of
the
highest
ethical
motives
of
which
man
is
capable
something
like
this
is
what
plato
means
when
he
speaks
of
the
soul
about
the
same
in
unchanging
thought
of
the
same
he
does
not
explain
how
man
is
acted
upon
by
the
lesser
influences
of
custom
or
of
opinion
or
how
the
commands
of
the
soul
watching
in
the
citadel
are
conveyed
to
the
bodily
organs
but
this
perhaps
to
use
once
more
expressions
of
his
own
part
of
another
subject
or
be
more
suitably
discussed
on
some
other
occasion
there
is
no
difficulty
by
the
help
of
aristotle
and
later
writers
in
criticizing
the
timaeus
of
plato
in
pointing
out
the
inconsistencies
of
the
work
in
dwelling
on
the
ignorance
of
anatomy
displayed
by
the
author
in
showing
the
fancifulness
or
unmeaningness
of
some
of
his
reasons
but
the
timaeus
still
remains
the
greatest
effort
of
the
human
mind
to
conceive
the
world
as
a
whole
which
the
genius
of
antiquity
has
bequeathed
to
us
one
more
aspect
of
the
timaeus
remains
to
be
considered
the
mythological
or
geographical
is
it
not
a
wonderful
thing
that
a
few
pages
of
one
of
plato
dialogues
have
grown
into
a
great
legend
not
confined
to
greece
only
but
spreading
far
and
wide
over
the
nations
of
europe
and
reaching
even
to
egypt
and
asia
like
the
tale
of
troy
or
the
legend
of
the
ten
tribes
ewald
hist
of
isr
which
perhaps
originated
in
a
few
verses
of
ii
esdras
it
has
become
famous
because
it
has
coincided
with
a
great
historical
fact
like
the
romance
of
king
arthur
which
has
had
so
great
a
charm
it
has
found
a
way
over
the
seas
from
one
country
and
language
to
another
it
inspired
the
navigators
of
the
fifteenth
and
sixteenth
centuries
it
foreshadowed
the
discovery
of
america
it
realized
the
fiction
so
natural
to
the
human
mind
because
it
answered
the
enquiry
about
the
origin
of
the
arts
that
there
had
somewhere
existed
an
ancient
primitive
civilization
it
might
find
a
place
wherever
men
chose
to
look
for
it
in
north
south
east
or
west
in
the
islands
of
the
blest
before
the
entrance
of
the
straits
of
gibraltar
in
sweden
or
in
palestine
it
mattered
little
whether
the
description
in
plato
agreed
with
the
locality
assigned
to
it
or
not
it
was
a
legend
so
adapted
to
the
human
mind
that
it
made
a
habitation
for
itself
in
any
country
it
was
an
island
in
the
clouds
which
might
be
seen
anywhere
by
the
eye
of
faith
it
was
a
subject
especially
congenial
to
the
ponderous
industry
of
certain
french
and
swedish
writers
who
delighted
in
heaping
up
learning
of
all
sorts
but
were
incapable
of
using
it
martin
has
written
a
valuable
dissertation
on
the
opinions
entertained
respecting
the
island
of
atlantis
in
ancient
and
modern
times
it
is
a
curious
chapter
in
the
history
of
the
human
mind
the
tale
of
atlantis
is
the
fabric
of
a
vision
but
it
has
never
ceased
to
interest
mankind
it
was
variously
regarded
by
the
ancients
themselves
the
stronger
heads
among
them
like
strabo
and
longinus
were
as
little
disposed
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
it
as
the
modern
reader
in
gulliver
or
robinson
crusoe
on
the
other
hand
there
is
no
kind
or
degree
of
absurdity
or
fancy
in
which
the
more
foolish
writers
both
of
antiquity
and
of
modern
times
have
not
indulged
respecting
it
the
loyal
to
their
master
like
some
commentators
on
the
christian
scriptures
sought
to
give
an
allegorical
meaning
to
what
they
also
believed
to
be
an
historical
fact
it
was
as
if
some
one
in
our
own
day
were
to
convert
the
poems
of
homer
into
an
allegory
of
the
christian
religion
at
the
same
time
maintaining
them
to
be
an
exact
and
veritable
history
in
the
middle
ages
the
legend
seems
to
have
been
until
revived
by
the
discovery
of
america
it
helped
to
form
the
utopia
of
sir
thomas
more
and
the
new
atlantis
of
bacon
although
probably
neither
of
those
great
men
were
at
all
imposed
upon
by
the
fiction
it
was
most
prolific
in
the
seventeenth
or
in
the
early
part
of
the
eighteenth
century
when
the
human
mind
seeking
for
utopias
or
inventing
them
was
glad
to
escape
out
of
the
dulness
of
the
present
into
the
romance
of
the
past
or
some
ideal
of
the
future
the
later
forms
of
such
narratives
contained
features
taken
from
the
edda
as
well
as
from
the
old
and
new
testament
also
from
the
tales
of
missionaries
and
the
experiences
of
travellers
and
of
colonists
the
various
opinions
respecting
the
island
of
atlantis
have
no
interest
for
us
except
in
so
far
as
they
illustrate
the
extravagances
of
which
men
are
capable
but
this
is
a
real
interest
and
a
serious
lesson
if
we
remember
that
now
as
formerly
the
human
mind
is
liable
to
be
imposed
upon
by
the
illusions
of
the
past
which
are
ever
assuming
some
new
form
when
we
have
shaken
off
the
rubbish
of
ages
there
remain
one
or
two
questions
of
which
the
investigation
has
a
permanent
value
did
plato
derive
the
legend
of
atlantis
from
an
egyptian
source
it
may
be
replied
that
there
is
no
such
legend
in
any
writer
previous
to
plato
neither
in
homer
nor
in
pindar
nor
in
herodotus
is
there
any
mention
of
an
island
of
atlantis
nor
any
reference
to
it
in
aristotle
nor
any
citation
of
an
earlier
writer
by
a
later
one
in
which
it
is
to
be
found
nor
have
any
traces
been
discovered
hitherto
in
egyptian
monuments
of
a
connexion
between
greece
and
egypt
older
than
the
eighth
or
ninth
century
it
is
true
that
proclus
writing
in
the
fifth
century
after
christ
tells
us
of
stones
and
columns
in
egypt
on
which
the
history
of
the
island
of
atlantis
was
engraved
the
statement
may
be
false
there
are
similar
tales
about
columns
set
up
the
canaanites
whom
joshua
drove
out
procop
but
even
if
true
it
would
only
show
that
the
legend
years
after
the
time
of
plato
had
been
transferred
to
egypt
and
inscribed
not
like
other
forgeries
in
books
but
on
stone
probably
in
the
alexandrian
age
when
egypt
had
ceased
to
have
a
history
and
began
to
appropriate
the
legends
of
other
nations
many
such
monuments
were
to
be
found
of
events
which
had
become
famous
in
that
or
other
countries
the
oldest
witness
to
the
story
is
said
to
be
crantor
a
stoic
philosopher
who
lived
a
generation
later
than
plato
and
therefore
may
have
borrowed
it
from
him
the
statement
is
found
in
proclus
but
we
require
better
assurance
than
proclus
can
give
us
before
we
accept
this
or
any
other
statement
which
he
makes
secondly
passing
from
the
external
to
the
internal
evidence
we
may
remark
that
the
story
is
far
more
likely
to
have
been
invented
by
plato
than
to
have
been
brought
by
solon
from
egypt
that
is
another
part
of
his
legend
which
plato
also
seeks
to
impose
upon
us
the
verisimilitude
which
he
has
given
to
the
tale
is
a
further
reason
for
suspecting
it
for
he
could
easily
egyptian
or
any
other
tales
phaedrus
are
not
the
words
truth
of
the
story
is
a
great
advantage
if
we
read
between
the
lines
an
indication
of
the
fiction
it
is
only
a
legend
that
solon
went
to
egypt
and
if
he
did
he
could
not
have
conversed
with
egyptian
priests
or
have
read
records
in
their
temples
the
truth
is
that
the
introduction
is
a
mosaic
work
of
small
touches
which
partly
by
their
minuteness
and
also
by
their
seeming
probability
win
the
confidence
of
the
reader
who
would
desire
better
evidence
than
that
of
critias
who
had
heard
the
narrative
in
youth
when
the
memory
is
strongest
at
the
age
of
ten
from
his
grandfather
critias
an
old
man
of
ninety
who
in
turn
had
heard
it
from
solon
himself
is
not
the
famous
expression
hellenes
are
ever
children
and
there
is
no
knowledge
among
you
hoary
with
age
really
a
compliment
to
the
athenians
who
are
described
in
these
words
as
young
and
is
the
thought
expressed
in
them
to
be
attributed
to
the
learning
of
the
egyptian
priest
and
not
rather
to
the
genius
of
plato
or
when
the
egyptian
says
at
our
leisure
we
will
take
up
the
written
documents
and
examine
in
detail
the
exact
truth
about
these
things
what
is
this
but
a
literary
trick
by
which
plato
sets
off
his
narrative
could
any
war
between
athens
and
the
island
of
atlantis
have
really
coincided
with
the
struggle
between
the
greeks
and
persians
as
is
sufficiently
hinted
though
not
expressly
stated
in
the
narrative
of
plato
and
whence
came
the
tradition
to
egypt
or
in
what
does
the
story
consist
except
in
the
war
between
the
two
rival
powers
and
the
submersion
of
both
of
them
and
how
was
the
tale
transferred
to
the
poem
of
solon
is
not
improbable
says
grote
solon
did
leave
an
unfinished
egyptian
poem
plato
but
are
probabilities
for
which
there
is
not
a
tittle
of
evidence
and
which
are
without
any
parallel
to
be
deemed
worthy
of
attention
by
the
critic
how
came
the
poem
of
solon
to
disappear
in
antiquity
or
why
did
plato
if
the
whole
narrative
was
known
to
him
break
off
almost
at
the
beginning
of
it
while
therefore
admiring
the
diligence
and
erudition
of
martin
we
can
not
for
a
moment
suppose
that
the
tale
was
told
to
solon
by
an
egyptian
priest
nor
can
we
believe
that
solon
wrote
a
poem
upon
the
theme
which
was
thus
suggested
to
him
a
poem
which
disappeared
in
antiquity
or
that
the
island
of
atlantis
or
the
antediluvian
athens
ever
had
any
existence
except
in
the
imagination
of
plato
martin
is
of
opinion
that
plato
would
have
been
terrified
if
he
could
have
foreseen
the
endless
fancies
to
which
his
island
of
atlantis
has
given
occasion
rather
he
would
have
been
infinitely
amused
if
he
could
have
known
that
his
gift
of
invention
would
have
deceived
martin
himself
into
the
belief
that
the
tradition
was
brought
from
egypt
by
solon
and
made
the
subject
of
a
poem
by
him
martin
may
also
be
gently
censured
for
citing
without
sufficient
discrimination
ancient
authors
having
very
different
degrees
of
authority
and
value
it
is
an
interesting
and
not
unimportant
question
which
is
touched
upon
by
martin
whether
the
atlantis
of
plato
in
any
degree
held
out
a
guiding
light
to
the
early
navigators
he
is
inclined
to
think
that
there
is
no
real
connexion
between
them
but
surely
the
discovery
of
the
new
world
was
preceded
by
a
prophetic
anticipation
of
it
which
like
the
hope
of
a
messiah
was
entering
into
the
hearts
of
men
and
this
hope
was
nursed
by
ancient
tradition
which
had
found
expression
from
time
to
time
in
the
celebrated
lines
of
seneca
and
in
many
other
places
this
tradition
was
sustained
by
the
great
authority
of
plato
and
therefore
the
legend
of
the
island
of
atlantis
though
not
closely
connected
with
the
voyages
of
the
early
navigators
may
be
truly
said
to
have
contributed
indirectly
to
the
great
discovery
the
timaeus
of
plato
like
the
protagoras
and
several
portions
of
the
phaedrus
and
republic
was
translated
by
cicero
into
latin
about
a
fourth
comprehending
with
lacunae
the
first
portion
of
the
dialogue
is
preserved
in
several
mss
these
generally
agree
and
therefore
may
be
supposed
to
be
derived
from
a
single
original
the
version
is
very
faithful
and
is
a
remarkable
monument
of
cicero
skill
in
managing
the
difficult
and
intractable
greek
in
his
treatise
de
natura
deorum
he
also
refers
to
the
timaeus
which
speaking
in
the
person
of
velleius
the
epicurean
he
severely
criticises
the
commentary
of
proclus
on
the
timaeus
is
a
wonderful
monument
of
the
silliness
and
prolixity
of
the
alexandrian
age
it
extends
to
about
thirty
pages
of
the
book
and
is
thirty
times
the
length
of
the
original
it
is
surprising
that
this
voluminous
work
should
have
found
a
translator
thomas
taylor
a
kindred
spirit
who
was
himself
a
after
the
fashion
not
of
the
fifth
or
sixteenth
but
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
commentary
is
of
little
or
no
value
either
in
a
philosophical
or
philological
point
of
view
the
writer
is
unable
to
explain
particular
passages
in
any
precise
manner
and
he
is
equally
incapable
of
grasping
the
whole
he
does
not
take
words
in
their
simple
meaning
or
sentences
in
their
natural
connexion
he
is
thinking
not
of
the
context
in
plato
but
of
the
contemporary
pythagorean
philosophers
and
their
wordy
strife
he
finds
nothing
in
the
text
which
he
does
not
bring
to
it
he
is
full
of
porphyry
iamblichus
and
plotinus
of
misapplied
logic
of
misunderstood
grammar
and
of
the
orphic
theology
although
such
a
work
can
contribute
little
or
nothing
to
the
understanding
of
plato
it
throws
an
interesting
light
on
the
alexandrian
times
it
realizes
how
a
philosophy
made
up
of
words
only
may
create
a
deep
and
widespread
enthusiasm
how
the
forms
of
logic
and
rhetoric
may
usurp
the
place
of
reason
and
truth
how
all
philosophies
grow
faded
and
discoloured
and
are
patched
and
made
up
again
like
garments
and
retain
only
a
existence
he
who
would
study
this
degeneracy
of
philosophy
and
of
the
greek
mind
in
the
original
can
not
do
better
than
devote
a
few
of
his
days
and
nights
to
the
commentary
of
proclus
on
the
timaeus
a
very
different
account
must
be
given
of
the
short
work
entitled
locrus
which
is
a
brief
but
clear
analysis
of
the
timaeus
of
plato
omitting
the
introduction
or
dialogue
and
making
a
few
small
additions
it
does
not
allude
to
the
original
from
which
it
is
taken
it
is
quite
free
from
mysticism
and
in
length
it
does
not
exceed
a
fifth
part
of
the
timaeus
it
is
written
in
the
doric
dialect
and
contains
several
words
which
do
not
occur
in
classical
greek
no
other
indication
of
its
date
except
this
uncertain
one
of
language
appears
in
it
in
several
places
the
writer
has
simplified
the
language
of
plato
in
a
few
others
he
has
embellished
and
exaggerated
it
he
generally
preserves
the
thought
of
the
original
but
does
not
copy
the
words
on
the
whole
this
little
tract
faithfully
reflects
the
meaning
and
spirit
of
the
timaeus
from
the
garden
of
the
timaeus
as
from
the
other
dialogues
of
plato
we
may
still
gather
a
few
flowers
and
present
them
at
parting
to
the
reader
there
is
nothing
in
plato
grander
and
simpler
than
the
conversation
between
solon
and
the
egyptian
priest
in
which
the
youthfulness
of
hellas
is
contrasted
with
the
antiquity
of
egypt
here
are
to
be
found
the
famous
words
solon
solon
you
hellenes
are
ever
young
and
there
is
not
an
old
man
among
you
which
may
be
compared
to
the
lively
saying
of
hegel
that
history
began
with
the
youth
achilles
and
left
off
with
the
youth
alexander
the
numerous
arts
of
verisimilitude
by
which
plato
insinuates
into
the
mind
of
the
reader
the
truth
of
his
narrative
have
been
already
referred
to
here
occur
a
sentence
or
two
not
wanting
in
platonic
irony
greek
a
word
to
the
wise
know
or
tell
the
origin
of
the
other
divinities
is
beyond
us
and
we
must
accept
the
traditions
of
the
men
of
old
time
who
affirm
themselves
to
be
the
offspring
of
the
gods
that
is
what
they
say
and
they
must
surely
have
known
their
own
ancestors
how
can
we
doubt
the
word
of
the
children
of
the
gods
although
they
give
no
probable
or
certain
proofs
still
as
they
declare
that
they
are
speaking
of
what
took
place
in
their
own
family
we
must
conform
to
custom
and
believe
them
creators
well
knew
that
women
and
other
animals
would
some
day
be
framed
out
of
men
and
they
further
knew
that
many
animals
would
require
the
use
of
nails
for
many
purposes
wherefore
they
fashioned
in
men
at
their
first
creation
the
rudiments
of
nails
or
once
more
let
us
reflect
on
two
serious
passages
in
which
the
order
of
the
world
is
supposed
to
find
a
place
in
the
human
soul
and
to
infuse
harmony
into
it
soul
when
touching
anything
that
has
essence
whether
dispersed
in
parts
or
undivided
is
stirred
through
all
her
powers
to
declare
the
sameness
or
difference
of
that
thing
and
some
other
and
to
what
individuals
are
related
and
by
what
affected
and
in
what
way
and
how
and
when
both
in
the
world
of
generation
and
in
the
world
of
immutable
being
and
when
reason
which
works
with
equal
truth
whether
she
be
in
the
circle
of
the
diverse
or
of
the
same
in
voiceless
silence
holding
her
onward
course
in
the
sphere
of
the
when
reason
i
say
is
hovering
around
the
sensible
world
and
when
the
circle
of
the
diverse
also
moving
truly
imparts
the
intimations
of
sense
to
the
whole
soul
then
arise
opinions
and
beliefs
sure
and
certain
but
when
reason
is
concerned
with
the
rational
and
the
circle
of
the
same
moving
smoothly
declares
it
then
intelligence
and
knowledge
are
necessarily
perfected
where
proceeding
in
a
similar
path
of
contemplation
he
supposes
the
inward
and
the
outer
world
mutually
to
imply
each
other
invented
and
gave
us
sight
to
the
end
that
we
might
behold
the
courses
of
intelligence
in
the
heaven
and
apply
them
to
the
courses
of
our
own
intelligence
which
are
akin
to
them
the
unperturbed
to
the
perturbed
and
that
we
learning
them
and
partaking
of
the
natural
truth
of
reason
might
imitate
the
absolutely
unerring
courses
of
god
and
regulate
our
own
vagaries
or
let
us
weigh
carefully
some
other
profound
thoughts
such
as
the
following
who
neglects
education
walks
lame
to
the
end
of
his
life
and
returns
imperfect
and
good
for
nothing
to
the
world
below
father
and
maker
of
all
this
universe
is
past
finding
out
and
even
if
we
found
him
to
tell
of
him
to
all
men
would
be
impossible
me
tell
you
then
why
the
creator
made
this
world
of
generation
he
was
good
and
the
good
can
never
have
jealousy
of
anything
and
being
free
from
jealousy
he
desired
that
all
things
should
be
as
like
himself
as
they
could
be
this
is
in
the
truest
sense
the
origin
of
creation
and
of
the
world
as
we
shall
do
well
in
believing
on
the
testimony
of
wise
men
god
desired
that
all
things
should
be
good
and
nothing
bad
so
far
as
this
was
attainable
this
is
the
leading
thought
in
the
timaeus
just
as
the
idea
of
good
is
the
leading
thought
of
the
republic
the
one
expression
describing
the
personal
the
other
the
impersonal
good
or
god
differing
in
form
rather
than
in
substance
and
both
equally
implying
to
the
mind
of
plato
a
divine
reality
the
slight
touch
perhaps
ironical
contained
in
the
words
we
shall
do
well
in
believing
on
the
testimony
of
wise
men
is
very
characteristic
of
plato
timaeus
persons
of
the
dialogue
socrates
critias
timaeus
hermocrates
socrates
one
two
three
but
where
my
dear
timaeus
is
the
fourth
of
those
who
were
yesterday
my
guests
and
are
to
be
my
entertainers
timaeus
he
has
been
taken
ill
socrates
for
he
would
not
willingly
have
been
absent
from
this
gathering
socrates
then
if
he
is
not
coming
you
and
the
two
others
must
supply
his
place
timaeus
certainly
and
we
will
do
all
that
we
can
having
been
handsomely
entertained
by
you
yesterday
those
of
us
who
remain
should
be
only
too
glad
to
return
your
hospitality
socrates
do
you
remember
what
were
the
points
of
which
i
required
you
to
speak
timaeus
we
remember
some
of
them
and
you
will
be
here
to
remind
us
of
anything
which
we
have
forgotten
or
rather
if
we
are
not
troubling
you
will
you
briefly
recapitulate
the
whole
and
then
the
particulars
will
be
more
firmly
fixed
in
our
memories
socrates
to
be
sure
i
will
the
chief
theme
of
my
yesterday
discourse
was
the
state
how
constituted
and
of
what
citizens
composed
it
would
seem
likely
to
be
most
perfect
timaeus
yes
socrates
and
what
you
said
of
it
was
very
much
to
our
mind
socrates
did
we
not
begin
by
separating
the
husbandmen
and
the
artisans
from
the
class
of
defenders
of
the
state
timaeus
yes
socrates
and
when
we
had
given
to
each
one
that
single
employment
and
particular
art
which
was
suited
to
his
nature
we
spoke
of
those
who
were
intended
to
be
our
warriors
and
said
that
they
were
to
be
guardians
of
the
city
against
attacks
from
within
as
well
as
from
without
and
to
have
no
other
employment
they
were
to
be
merciful
in
judging
their
subjects
of
whom
they
were
by
nature
friends
but
fierce
to
their
enemies
when
they
came
across
them
in
battle
timaeus
exactly
socrates
we
said
if
i
am
not
mistaken
that
the
guardians
should
be
gifted
with
a
temperament
in
a
high
degree
both
passionate
and
philosophical
and
that
then
they
would
be
as
they
ought
to
be
gentle
to
their
friends
and
fierce
with
their
enemies
timaeus
certainly
socrates
and
what
did
we
say
of
their
education
were
they
not
to
be
trained
in
gymnastic
and
music
and
all
other
sorts
of
knowledge
which
were
proper
for
them
timaeus
very
true
socrates
and
being
thus
trained
they
were
not
to
consider
gold
or
silver
or
anything
else
to
be
their
own
private
property
they
were
to
be
like
hired
troops
receiving
pay
for
keeping
guard
from
those
who
were
protected
by
them
the
pay
was
to
be
no
more
than
would
suffice
for
men
of
simple
life
and
they
were
to
spend
in
common
and
to
live
together
in
the
continual
practice
of
virtue
which
was
to
be
their
sole
pursuit
timaeus
that
was
also
said
socrates
neither
did
we
forget
the
women
of
whom
we
declared
that
their
natures
should
be
assimilated
and
brought
into
harmony
with
those
of
the
men
and
that
common
pursuits
should
be
assigned
to
them
both
in
time
of
war
and
in
their
ordinary
life
timaeus
that
again
was
as
you
say
socrates
and
what
about
the
procreation
of
children
or
rather
was
not
the
proposal
too
singular
to
be
forgotten
for
all
wives
and
children
were
to
be
in
common
to
the
intent
that
no
one
should
ever
know
his
own
child
but
they
were
to
imagine
that
they
were
all
one
family
those
who
were
within
a
suitable
limit
of
age
were
to
be
brothers
and
sisters
those
who
were
of
an
elder
generation
parents
and
grandparents
and
those
of
a
younger
children
and
grandchildren
timaeus
yes
and
the
proposal
is
easy
to
remember
as
you
say
socrates
and
do
you
also
remember
how
with
a
view
of
securing
as
far
as
we
could
the
best
breed
we
said
that
the
chief
magistrates
male
and
female
should
contrive
secretly
by
the
use
of
certain
lots
so
to
arrange
the
nuptial
meeting
that
the
bad
of
either
sex
and
the
good
of
either
sex
might
pair
with
their
like
and
there
was
to
be
no
quarrelling
on
this
account
for
they
would
imagine
that
the
union
was
a
mere
accident
and
was
to
be
attributed
to
the
lot
timaeus
i
remember
socrates
and
you
remember
how
we
said
that
the
children
of
the
good
parents
were
to
be
educated
and
the
children
of
the
bad
secretly
dispersed
among
the
inferior
citizens
and
while
they
were
all
growing
up
the
rulers
were
to
be
on
the
and
to
bring
up
from
below
in
their
turn
those
who
were
worthy
and
those
among
themselves
who
were
unworthy
were
to
take
the
places
of
those
who
came
up
timaeus
true
socrates
then
have
i
now
given
you
all
the
heads
of
our
discussion
or
is
there
anything
more
my
dear
timaeus
which
has
been
omitted
timaeus
nothing
socrates
it
was
just
as
you
have
said
socrates
i
should
like
before
proceeding
further
to
tell
you
how
i
feel
about
the
state
which
we
have
described
i
might
compare
myself
to
a
person
who
on
beholding
beautiful
animals
either
created
by
the
painter
art
or
better
still
alive
but
at
rest
is
seized
with
a
desire
of
seeing
them
in
motion
or
engaged
in
some
struggle
or
conflict
to
which
their
forms
appear
suited
this
is
my
feeling
about
the
state
which
we
have
been
describing
there
are
conflicts
which
all
cities
undergo
and
i
should
like
to
hear
some
one
tell
of
our
own
city
carrying
on
a
struggle
against
her
neighbours
and
how
she
went
out
to
war
in
a
becoming
manner
and
when
at
war
showed
by
the
greatness
of
her
actions
and
the
magnanimity
of
her
words
in
dealing
with
other
cities
a
result
worthy
of
her
training
and
education
now
i
critias
and
hermocrates
am
conscious
that
i
myself
should
never
be
able
to
celebrate
the
city
and
her
citizens
in
a
befitting
manner
and
i
am
not
surprised
at
my
own
incapacity
to
me
the
wonder
is
rather
that
the
poets
present
as
well
as
past
are
no
better
not
that
i
mean
to
depreciate
them
but
every
one
can
see
that
they
are
a
tribe
of
imitators
and
will
imitate
best
and
most
easily
the
life
in
which
they
have
been
brought
up
while
that
which
is
beyond
the
range
of
a
education
he
finds
hard
to
carry
out
in
action
and
still
harder
adequately
to
represent
in
language
i
am
aware
that
the
sophists
have
plenty
of
brave
words
and
fair
conceits
but
i
am
afraid
that
being
only
wanderers
from
one
city
to
another
and
having
never
had
habitations
of
their
own
they
may
fail
in
their
conception
of
philosophers
and
statesmen
and
may
not
know
what
they
do
and
say
in
time
of
war
when
they
are
fighting
or
holding
parley
with
their
enemies
and
thus
people
of
your
class
are
the
only
ones
remaining
who
are
fitted
by
nature
and
education
to
take
part
at
once
both
in
politics
and
philosophy
here
is
timaeus
of
locris
in
italy
a
city
which
has
admirable
laws
and
who
is
himself
in
wealth
and
rank
the
equal
of
any
of
his
he
has
held
the
most
important
and
honourable
offices
in
his
own
state
and
as
i
believe
has
scaled
the
heights
of
all
philosophy
and
here
is
critias
whom
every
athenian
knows
to
be
no
novice
in
the
matters
of
which
we
are
speaking
and
as
to
hermocrates
i
am
assured
by
many
witnesses
that
his
genius
and
education
qualify
him
to
take
part
in
any
speculation
of
the
kind
and
therefore
yesterday
when
i
saw
that
you
wanted
me
to
describe
the
formation
of
the
state
i
readily
assented
being
very
well
aware
that
if
you
only
would
none
were
better
qualified
to
carry
the
discussion
further
and
that
when
you
had
engaged
our
city
in
a
suitable
war
you
of
all
men
living
could
best
exhibit
her
playing
a
fitting
part
when
i
had
completed
my
task
i
in
return
imposed
this
other
task
upon
you
you
conferred
together
and
agreed
to
entertain
me
as
i
had
entertained
you
with
a
feast
of
discourse
here
am
i
in
festive
array
and
no
man
can
be
more
ready
for
the
promised
banquet
hermocrates
and
we
too
socrates
as
timaeus
says
will
not
be
wanting
in
enthusiasm
and
there
is
no
excuse
for
not
complying
with
your
request
as
soon
as
we
arrived
yesterday
at
the
of
critias
with
whom
we
are
staying
or
rather
on
our
way
thither
we
talked
the
matter
over
and
he
told
us
an
ancient
tradition
which
i
wish
critias
that
you
would
repeat
to
socrates
so
that
he
may
help
us
to
judge
whether
it
will
satisfy
his
requirements
or
not
critias
i
will
if
timaeus
who
is
our
other
partner
approves
timaeus
i
quite
approve
critias
then
listen
socrates
to
a
tale
which
though
strange
is
certainly
true
having
been
attested
by
solon
who
was
the
wisest
of
the
seven
sages
he
was
a
relative
and
a
dear
friend
of
my
dropides
as
he
himself
says
in
many
passages
of
his
poems
and
he
told
the
story
to
critias
my
grandfather
who
remembered
and
repeated
it
to
us
there
were
of
old
he
said
great
and
marvellous
actions
of
the
athenian
city
which
have
passed
into
oblivion
through
lapse
of
time
and
the
destruction
of
mankind
and
one
in
particular
greater
than
all
the
rest
this
we
will
now
rehearse
it
will
be
a
fitting
monument
of
our
gratitude
to
you
and
a
hymn
of
praise
true
and
worthy
of
the
goddess
on
this
her
day
of
festival
socrates
very
good
and
what
is
this
ancient
famous
action
of
the
athenians
which
critias
declared
on
the
authority
of
solon
to
be
not
a
mere
legend
but
an
actual
fact
critias
i
will
tell
an
story
which
i
heard
from
an
aged
man
for
critias
at
the
time
of
telling
it
was
as
he
said
nearly
ninety
years
of
age
and
i
was
about
ten
now
the
day
was
that
day
of
the
apaturia
which
is
called
the
registration
of
youth
at
which
according
to
custom
our
parents
gave
prizes
for
recitations
and
the
poems
of
several
poets
were
recited
by
us
boys
and
many
of
us
sang
the
poems
of
solon
which
at
that
time
had
not
gone
out
of
fashion
one
of
our
tribe
either
because
he
thought
so
or
to
please
critias
said
that
in
his
judgment
solon
was
not
only
the
wisest
of
men
but
also
the
noblest
of
poets
the
old
man
as
i
very
well
remember
brightened
up
at
hearing
this
and
said
smiling
yes
amynander
if
solon
had
only
like
other
poets
made
poetry
the
business
of
his
life
and
had
completed
the
tale
which
he
brought
with
him
from
egypt
and
had
not
been
compelled
by
reason
of
the
factions
and
troubles
which
he
found
stirring
in
his
own
country
when
he
came
home
to
attend
to
other
matters
in
my
opinion
he
would
have
been
as
famous
as
homer
or
hesiod
or
any
poet
and
what
was
the
tale
about
critias
said
amynander
about
the
greatest
action
which
the
athenians
ever
did
and
which
ought
to
have
been
the
most
famous
but
through
the
lapse
of
time
and
the
destruction
of
the
actors
it
has
not
come
down
to
us
tell
us
said
the
other
the
whole
story
and
how
and
from
whom
solon
heard
this
veritable
tradition
he
replied
in
the
egyptian
delta
at
the
head
of
which
the
river
nile
divides
there
is
a
certain
district
which
is
called
the
district
of
sais
and
the
great
city
of
the
district
is
also
called
sais
and
is
the
city
from
which
king
amasis
came
the
citizens
have
a
deity
for
their
foundress
she
is
called
in
the
egyptian
tongue
neith
and
is
asserted
by
them
to
be
the
same
whom
the
hellenes
call
athene
they
are
great
lovers
of
the
athenians
and
say
that
they
are
in
some
way
related
to
them
to
this
city
came
solon
and
was
received
there
with
great
honour
he
asked
the
priests
who
were
most
skilful
in
such
matters
about
antiquity
and
made
the
discovery
that
neither
he
nor
any
other
hellene
knew
anything
worth
mentioning
about
the
times
of
old
on
one
occasion
wishing
to
draw
them
on
to
speak
of
antiquity
he
began
to
tell
about
the
most
ancient
things
in
our
part
of
the
world
about
phoroneus
who
is
called
first
man
and
about
niobe
and
after
the
deluge
of
the
survival
of
deucalion
and
pyrrha
and
he
traced
the
genealogy
of
their
descendants
and
reckoning
up
the
dates
tried
to
compute
how
many
years
ago
the
events
of
which
he
was
speaking
happened
thereupon
one
of
the
priests
who
was
of
a
very
great
age
said
o
solon
solon
you
hellenes
are
never
anything
but
children
and
there
is
not
an
old
man
among
you
solon
in
return
asked
him
what
he
meant
i
mean
to
say
he
replied
that
in
mind
you
are
all
young
there
is
no
old
opinion
handed
down
among
you
by
ancient
tradition
nor
any
science
which
is
hoary
with
age
and
i
will
tell
you
why
there
have
been
and
will
be
again
many
destructions
of
mankind
arising
out
of
many
causes
the
greatest
have
been
brought
about
by
the
agencies
of
fire
and
water
and
other
lesser
ones
by
innumerable
other
causes
there
is
a
story
which
even
you
have
preserved
that
once
upon
a
time
paethon
the
son
of
helios
having
yoked
the
steeds
in
his
father
chariot
because
he
was
not
able
to
drive
them
in
the
path
of
his
father
burnt
up
all
that
was
upon
the
earth
and
was
himself
destroyed
by
a
thunderbolt
now
this
has
the
form
of
a
myth
but
really
signifies
a
declination
of
the
bodies
moving
in
the
heavens
around
the
earth
and
a
great
conflagration
of
things
upon
the
earth
which
recurs
after
long
intervals
at
such
times
those
who
live
upon
the
mountains
and
in
dry
and
lofty
places
are
more
liable
to
destruction
than
those
who
dwell
by
rivers
or
on
the
seashore
and
from
this
calamity
the
nile
who
is
our
saviour
delivers
and
preserves
us
when
on
the
other
hand
the
gods
purge
the
earth
with
a
deluge
of
water
the
survivors
in
your
country
are
herdsmen
and
shepherds
who
dwell
on
the
mountains
but
those
who
like
you
live
in
cities
are
carried
by
the
rivers
into
the
sea
whereas
in
this
land
neither
then
nor
at
any
other
time
does
the
water
come
down
from
above
on
the
fields
having
always
a
tendency
to
come
up
from
below
for
which
reason
the
traditions
preserved
here
are
the
most
ancient
the
fact
is
that
wherever
the
extremity
of
winter
frost
or
of
summer
sun
does
not
prevent
mankind
exist
sometimes
in
greater
sometimes
in
lesser
numbers
and
whatever
happened
either
in
your
country
or
in
ours
or
in
any
other
region
of
which
we
are
informed
if
there
were
any
actions
noble
or
great
or
in
any
other
way
remarkable
they
have
all
been
written
down
by
us
of
old
and
are
preserved
in
our
temples
whereas
just
when
you
and
other
nations
are
beginning
to
be
provided
with
letters
and
the
other
requisites
of
civilized
life
after
the
usual
interval
the
stream
from
heaven
like
a
pestilence
comes
pouring
down
and
leaves
only
those
of
you
who
are
destitute
of
letters
and
education
and
so
you
have
to
begin
all
over
again
like
children
and
know
nothing
of
what
happened
in
ancient
times
either
among
us
or
among
yourselves
as
for
those
genealogies
of
yours
which
you
just
now
recounted
to
us
solon
they
are
no
better
than
the
tales
of
children
in
the
first
place
you
remember
a
single
deluge
only
but
there
were
many
previous
ones
in
the
next
place
you
do
not
know
that
there
formerly
dwelt
in
your
land
the
fairest
and
noblest
race
of
men
which
ever
lived
and
that
you
and
your
whole
city
are
descended
from
a
small
seed
or
remnant
of
them
which
survived
and
this
was
unknown
to
you
because
for
many
generations
the
survivors
of
that
destruction
died
leaving
no
written
word
for
there
was
a
time
solon
before
the
great
deluge
of
all
when
the
city
which
now
is
athens
was
first
in
war
and
in
every
way
the
best
governed
of
all
cities
is
said
to
have
performed
the
noblest
deeds
and
to
have
had
the
fairest
constitution
of
any
of
which
tradition
tells
under
the
face
of
heaven
solon
marvelled
at
his
words
and
earnestly
requested
the
priests
to
inform
him
exactly
and
in
order
about
these
former
citizens
you
are
welcome
to
hear
about
them
solon
said
the
priest
both
for
your
own
sake
and
for
that
of
your
city
and
above
all
for
the
sake
of
the
goddess
who
is
the
common
patron
and
parent
and
educator
of
both
our
cities
she
founded
your
city
a
thousand
years
before
ours
observe
that
plato
gives
the
same
date
years
ago
for
the
foundation
of
athens
and
for
the
repulse
of
the
invasion
from
atlantis
receiving
from
the
earth
and
hephaestus
the
seed
of
your
race
and
afterwards
she
founded
ours
of
which
the
constitution
is
recorded
in
our
sacred
registers
to
be
years
old
as
touching
your
citizens
of
years
ago
i
will
briefly
inform
you
of
their
laws
and
of
their
most
famous
action
the
exact
particulars
of
the
whole
we
will
hereafter
go
through
at
our
leisure
in
the
sacred
registers
themselves
if
you
compare
these
very
laws
with
ours
you
will
find
that
many
of
ours
are
the
counterpart
of
yours
as
they
were
in
the
olden
time
in
the
first
place
there
is
the
caste
of
priests
which
is
separated
from
all
the
others
next
there
are
the
artificers
who
ply
their
several
crafts
by
themselves
and
do
not
intermix
and
also
there
is
the
class
of
shepherds
and
of
hunters
as
well
as
that
of
husbandmen
and
you
will
observe
too
that
the
warriors
in
egypt
are
distinct
from
all
the
other
classes
and
are
commanded
by
the
law
to
devote
themselves
solely
to
military
pursuits
moreover
the
weapons
which
they
carry
are
shields
and
spears
a
style
of
equipment
which
the
goddess
taught
of
asiatics
first
to
us
as
in
your
part
of
the
world
first
to
you
then
as
to
wisdom
do
you
observe
how
our
law
from
the
very
first
made
a
study
of
the
whole
order
of
things
extending
even
to
prophecy
and
medicine
which
gives
health
out
of
these
divine
elements
deriving
what
was
needful
for
human
life
and
adding
every
sort
of
knowledge
which
was
akin
to
them
all
this
order
and
arrangement
the
goddess
first
imparted
to
you
when
establishing
your
city
and
she
chose
the
spot
of
earth
in
which
you
were
born
because
she
saw
that
the
happy
temperament
of
the
seasons
in
that
land
would
produce
the
wisest
of
men
wherefore
the
goddess
who
was
a
lover
both
of
war
and
of
wisdom
selected
and
first
of
all
settled
that
spot
which
was
the
most
likely
to
produce
men
likest
herself
and
there
you
dwelt
having
such
laws
as
these
and
still
better
ones
and
excelled
all
mankind
in
all
virtue
as
became
the
children
and
disciples
of
the
gods
many
great
and
wonderful
deeds
are
recorded
of
your
state
in
our
histories
but
one
of
them
exceeds
all
the
rest
in
greatness
and
valour
for
these
histories
tell
of
a
mighty
power
which
unprovoked
made
an
expedition
against
the
whole
of
europe
and
asia
and
to
which
your
city
put
an
end
this
power
came
forth
out
of
the
atlantic
ocean
for
in
those
days
the
atlantic
was
navigable
and
there
was
an
island
situated
in
front
of
the
straits
which
are
by
you
called
the
pillars
of
heracles
the
island
was
larger
than
libya
and
asia
put
together
and
was
the
way
to
other
islands
and
from
these
you
might
pass
to
the
whole
of
the
opposite
continent
which
surrounded
the
true
ocean
for
this
sea
which
is
within
the
straits
of
heracles
is
only
a
harbour
having
a
narrow
entrance
but
that
other
is
a
real
sea
and
the
surrounding
land
may
be
most
truly
called
a
boundless
continent
now
in
this
island
of
atlantis
there
was
a
great
and
wonderful
empire
which
had
rule
over
the
whole
island
and
several
others
and
over
parts
of
the
continent
and
furthermore
the
men
of
atlantis
had
subjected
the
parts
of
libya
within
the
columns
of
heracles
as
far
as
egypt
and
of
europe
as
far
as
tyrrhenia
this
vast
power
gathered
into
one
endeavoured
to
subdue
at
a
blow
our
country
and
yours
and
the
whole
of
the
region
within
the
straits
and
then
solon
your
country
shone
forth
in
the
excellence
of
her
virtue
and
strength
among
all
mankind
she
was
in
courage
and
military
skill
and
was
the
leader
of
the
hellenes
and
when
the
rest
fell
off
from
her
being
compelled
to
stand
alone
after
having
undergone
the
very
extremity
of
danger
she
defeated
and
triumphed
over
the
invaders
and
preserved
from
slavery
those
who
were
not
yet
subjugated
and
generously
liberated
all
the
rest
of
us
who
dwell
within
the
pillars
but
afterwards
there
occurred
violent
earthquakes
and
floods
and
in
a
single
day
and
night
of
misfortune
all
your
warlike
men
in
a
body
sank
into
the
earth
and
the
island
of
atlantis
in
like
manner
disappeared
in
the
depths
of
the
sea
for
which
reason
the
sea
in
those
parts
is
impassable
and
impenetrable
because
there
is
a
shoal
of
mud
in
the
way
and
this
was
caused
by
the
subsidence
of
the
island
i
have
told
you
briefly
socrates
what
the
aged
critias
heard
from
solon
and
related
to
us
and
when
you
were
speaking
yesterday
about
your
city
and
citizens
the
tale
which
i
have
just
been
repeating
to
you
came
into
my
mind
and
i
remarked
with
astonishment
how
by
some
mysterious
coincidence
you
agreed
in
almost
every
particular
with
the
narrative
of
solon
but
i
did
not
like
to
speak
at
the
moment
for
a
long
time
had
elapsed
and
i
had
forgotten
too
much
i
thought
that
i
must
first
of
all
run
over
the
narrative
in
my
own
mind
and
then
i
would
speak
and
so
i
readily
assented
to
your
request
yesterday
considering
that
in
all
such
cases
the
chief
difficulty
is
to
find
a
tale
suitable
to
our
purpose
and
that
with
such
a
tale
we
should
be
fairly
well
provided
and
therefore
as
hermocrates
has
told
you
on
my
way
home
yesterday
i
at
once
communicated
the
tale
to
my
companions
as
i
remembered
it
and
after
i
left
them
during
the
night
by
thinking
i
recovered
nearly
the
whole
of
it
truly
as
is
often
said
the
lessons
of
our
childhood
make
a
wonderful
impression
on
our
memories
for
i
am
not
sure
that
i
could
remember
all
the
discourse
of
yesterday
but
i
should
be
much
surprised
if
i
forgot
any
of
these
things
which
i
have
heard
very
long
ago
i
listened
at
the
time
with
childlike
interest
to
the
old
man
narrative
he
was
very
ready
to
teach
me
and
i
asked
him
again
and
again
to
repeat
his
words
so
that
like
an
indelible
picture
they
were
branded
into
my
mind
as
soon
as
the
day
broke
i
rehearsed
them
as
he
spoke
them
to
my
companions
that
they
as
well
as
myself
might
have
something
to
say
and
now
socrates
to
make
an
end
of
my
preface
i
am
ready
to
tell
you
the
whole
tale
i
will
give
you
not
only
the
general
heads
but
the
particulars
as
they
were
told
to
me
the
city
and
citizens
which
you
yesterday
described
to
us
in
fiction
we
will
now
transfer
to
the
world
of
reality
it
shall
be
the
ancient
city
of
athens
and
we
will
suppose
that
the
citizens
whom
you
imagined
were
our
veritable
ancestors
of
whom
the
priest
spoke
they
will
perfectly
harmonize
and
there
will
be
no
inconsistency
in
saying
that
the
citizens
of
your
republic
are
these
ancient
athenians
let
us
divide
the
subject
among
us
and
all
endeavour
according
to
our
ability
gracefully
to
execute
the
task
which
you
have
imposed
upon
us
consider
then
socrates
if
this
narrative
is
suited
to
the
purpose
or
whether
we
should
seek
for
some
other
instead
socrates
and
what
other
critias
can
we
find
that
will
be
better
than
this
which
is
natural
and
suitable
to
the
festival
of
the
goddess
and
has
the
very
great
advantage
of
being
a
fact
and
not
a
fiction
how
or
where
shall
we
find
another
if
we
abandon
this
we
can
not
and
therefore
you
must
tell
the
tale
and
good
luck
to
you
and
i
in
return
for
my
yesterday
discourse
will
now
rest
and
be
a
listener
critias
let
me
proceed
to
explain
to
you
socrates
the
order
in
which
we
have
arranged
our
entertainment
our
intention
is
that
timaeus
who
is
the
most
of
an
astronomer
amongst
us
and
has
made
the
nature
of
the
universe
his
special
study
should
speak
first
beginning
with
the
generation
of
the
world
and
going
down
to
the
creation
of
man
next
i
am
to
receive
the
men
whom
he
has
created
and
of
whom
some
will
have
profited
by
the
excellent
education
which
you
have
given
them
and
then
in
accordance
with
the
tale
of
solon
and
equally
with
his
law
we
will
bring
them
into
court
and
make
them
citizens
as
if
they
were
those
very
athenians
whom
the
sacred
egyptian
record
has
recovered
from
oblivion
and
thenceforward
we
will
speak
of
them
as
athenians
and
socrates
i
see
that
i
shall
receive
in
my
turn
a
perfect
and
splendid
feast
of
reason
and
now
timaeus
you
i
suppose
should
speak
next
after
duly
calling
upon
the
gods
timaeus
all
men
socrates
who
have
any
degree
of
right
feeling
at
the
beginning
of
every
enterprise
whether
small
or
great
always
call
upon
god
and
we
too
who
are
going
to
discourse
of
the
nature
of
the
universe
how
created
or
how
existing
without
creation
if
we
be
not
altogether
out
of
our
wits
must
invoke
the
aid
of
gods
and
goddesses
and
pray
that
our
words
may
be
acceptable
to
them
and
consistent
with
themselves
let
this
then
be
our
invocation
of
the
gods
to
which
i
add
an
exhortation
of
myself
to
speak
in
such
manner
as
will
be
most
intelligible
to
you
and
will
most
accord
with
my
own
intent
first
then
in
my
judgment
we
must
make
a
distinction
and
ask
what
is
that
which
always
is
and
has
no
becoming
and
what
is
that
which
is
always
becoming
and
never
is
that
which
is
apprehended
by
intelligence
and
reason
is
always
in
the
same
state
but
that
which
is
conceived
by
opinion
with
the
help
of
sensation
and
without
reason
is
always
in
a
process
of
becoming
and
perishing
and
never
really
is
now
everything
that
becomes
or
is
created
must
of
necessity
be
created
by
some
cause
for
without
a
cause
nothing
can
be
created
the
work
of
the
creator
whenever
he
looks
to
the
unchangeable
and
fashions
the
form
and
nature
of
his
work
after
an
unchangeable
pattern
must
necessarily
be
made
fair
and
perfect
but
when
he
looks
to
the
created
only
and
uses
a
created
pattern
it
is
not
fair
or
perfect
was
the
heaven
then
or
the
world
whether
called
by
this
or
by
any
other
more
appropriate
name
assuming
the
name
i
am
asking
a
question
which
has
to
be
asked
at
the
beginning
of
an
enquiry
about
anything
was
the
world
i
say
always
in
existence
and
without
beginning
or
created
and
had
it
a
beginning
created
i
reply
being
visible
and
tangible
and
having
a
body
and
therefore
sensible
and
all
sensible
things
are
apprehended
by
opinion
and
sense
and
are
in
a
process
of
creation
and
created
now
that
which
is
created
must
as
we
affirm
of
necessity
be
created
by
a
cause
but
the
father
and
maker
of
all
this
universe
is
past
finding
out
and
even
if
we
found
him
to
tell
of
him
to
all
men
would
be
impossible
and
there
is
still
a
question
to
be
asked
about
him
which
of
the
patterns
had
the
artificer
in
view
when
he
made
the
world
the
pattern
of
the
unchangeable
or
of
that
which
is
created
if
the
world
be
indeed
fair
and
the
artificer
good
it
is
manifest
that
he
must
have
looked
to
that
which
is
eternal
but
if
what
can
not
be
said
without
blasphemy
is
true
then
to
the
created
pattern
every
one
will
see
that
he
must
have
looked
to
the
eternal
for
the
world
is
the
fairest
of
creations
and
he
is
the
best
of
causes
and
having
been
created
in
this
way
the
world
has
been
framed
in
the
likeness
of
that
which
is
apprehended
by
reason
and
mind
and
is
unchangeable
and
must
therefore
of
necessity
if
this
is
admitted
be
a
copy
of
something
now
it
is
that
the
beginning
of
everything
should
be
according
to
nature
and
in
speaking
of
the
copy
and
the
original
we
may
assume
that
words
are
akin
to
the
matter
which
they
describe
when
they
relate
to
the
lasting
and
permanent
and
intelligible
they
ought
to
be
lasting
and
unalterable
and
as
far
as
their
nature
allows
irrefutable
and
immovable
nothing
less
but
when
they
express
only
the
copy
or
likeness
and
not
the
eternal
things
themselves
they
need
only
be
likely
and
analogous
to
the
real
words
as
being
is
to
becoming
so
is
truth
to
belief
if
then
socrates
amid
the
many
opinions
about
the
gods
and
the
generation
of
the
universe
we
are
not
able
to
give
notions
which
are
altogether
and
in
every
respect
exact
and
consistent
with
one
another
do
not
be
surprised
enough
if
we
adduce
probabilities
as
likely
as
any
others
for
we
must
remember
that
i
who
am
the
speaker
and
you
who
are
the
judges
are
only
mortal
men
and
we
ought
to
accept
the
tale
which
is
probable
and
enquire
no
further
socrates
excellent
timaeus
and
we
will
do
precisely
as
you
bid
us
the
prelude
is
charming
and
is
already
accepted
by
us
may
we
beg
of
you
to
proceed
to
the
strain
timaeus
let
me
tell
you
then
why
the
creator
made
this
world
of
generation
he
was
good
and
the
good
can
never
have
any
jealousy
of
anything
and
being
free
from
jealousy
he
desired
that
all
things
should
be
as
like
himself
as
they
could
be
this
is
in
the
truest
sense
the
origin
of
creation
and
of
the
world
as
we
shall
do
well
in
believing
on
the
testimony
of
wise
men
god
desired
that
all
things
should
be
good
and
nothing
bad
so
far
as
this
was
attainable
wherefore
also
finding
the
whole
visible
sphere
not
at
rest
but
moving
in
an
irregular
and
disorderly
fashion
out
of
disorder
he
brought
order
considering
that
this
was
in
every
way
better
than
the
other
now
the
deeds
of
the
best
could
never
be
or
have
been
other
than
the
fairest
and
the
creator
reflecting
on
the
things
which
are
by
nature
visible
found
that
no
unintelligent
creature
taken
as
a
whole
was
fairer
than
the
intelligent
taken
as
a
whole
and
that
intelligence
could
not
be
present
in
anything
which
was
devoid
of
soul
for
which
reason
when
he
was
framing
the
universe
he
put
intelligence
in
soul
and
soul
in
body
that
he
might
be
the
creator
of
a
work
which
was
by
nature
fairest
and
best
wherefore
using
the
language
of
probability
we
may
say
that
the
world
became
a
living
creature
truly
endowed
with
soul
and
intelligence
by
the
providence
of
god
this
being
supposed
let
us
proceed
to
the
next
stage
in
the
likeness
of
what
animal
did
the
creator
make
the
world
it
would
be
an
unworthy
thing
to
liken
it
to
any
nature
which
exists
as
a
part
only
for
nothing
can
be
beautiful
which
is
like
any
imperfect
thing
but
let
us
suppose
the
world
to
be
the
very
image
of
that
whole
of
which
all
other
animals
both
individually
and
in
their
tribes
are
portions
for
the
original
of
the
universe
contains
in
itself
all
intelligible
beings
just
as
this
world
comprehends
us
and
all
other
visible
creatures
for
the
deity
intending
to
make
this
world
like
the
fairest
and
most
perfect
of
intelligible
beings
framed
one
visible
animal
comprehending
within
itself
all
other
animals
of
a
kindred
nature
are
we
right
in
saying
that
there
is
one
world
or
that
they
are
many
and
infinite
there
must
be
one
only
if
the
created
copy
is
to
accord
with
the
original
for
that
which
includes
all
other
intelligible
creatures
can
not
have
a
second
or
companion
in
that
case
there
would
be
need
of
another
living
being
which
would
include
both
and
of
which
they
would
be
parts
and
the
likeness
would
be
more
truly
said
to
resemble
not
them
but
that
other
which
included
them
in
order
then
that
the
world
might
be
solitary
like
the
perfect
animal
the
creator
made
not
two
worlds
or
an
infinite
number
of
them
but
there
is
and
ever
will
be
one
and
created
heaven
now
that
which
is
created
is
of
necessity
corporeal
and
also
visible
and
tangible
and
nothing
is
visible
where
there
is
no
fire
or
tangible
which
has
no
solidity
and
nothing
is
solid
without
earth
wherefore
also
god
in
the
beginning
of
creation
made
the
body
of
the
universe
to
consist
of
fire
and
earth
but
two
things
can
not
be
rightly
put
together
without
a
third
there
must
be
some
bond
of
union
between
them
and
the
fairest
bond
is
that
which
makes
the
most
complete
fusion
of
itself
and
the
things
which
it
combines
and
proportion
is
best
adapted
to
effect
such
a
union
for
whenever
in
any
three
numbers
whether
cube
or
square
there
is
a
mean
which
is
to
the
last
term
what
the
first
term
is
to
it
and
again
when
the
mean
is
to
the
first
term
as
the
last
term
is
to
the
mean
then
the
mean
becoming
first
and
last
and
the
first
and
last
both
becoming
means
they
will
all
of
them
of
necessity
come
to
be
the
same
and
having
become
the
same
with
one
another
will
be
all
one
if
the
universal
frame
had
been
created
a
surface
only
and
having
no
depth
a
single
mean
would
have
sufficed
to
bind
together
itself
and
the
other
terms
but
now
as
the
world
must
be
solid
and
solid
bodies
are
always
compacted
not
by
one
mean
but
by
two
god
placed
water
and
air
in
the
mean
between
fire
and
earth
and
made
them
to
have
the
same
proportion
so
far
as
was
possible
as
fire
is
to
air
so
is
air
to
water
and
as
air
is
to
water
so
is
water
to
earth
and
thus
he
bound
and
put
together
a
visible
and
tangible
heaven
and
for
these
reasons
and
out
of
such
elements
which
are
in
number
four
the
body
of
the
world
was
created
and
it
was
harmonized
by
proportion
and
therefore
has
the
spirit
of
friendship
and
having
been
reconciled
to
itself
it
was
indissoluble
by
the
hand
of
any
other
than
the
framer
now
the
creation
took
up
the
whole
of
each
of
the
four
elements
for
the
creator
compounded
the
world
out
of
all
the
fire
and
all
the
water
and
all
the
air
and
all
the
earth
leaving
no
part
of
any
of
them
nor
any
power
of
them
outside
his
intention
was
in
the
first
place
that
the
animal
should
be
as
far
as
possible
a
perfect
whole
and
of
perfect
parts
secondly
that
it
should
be
one
leaving
no
remnants
out
of
which
another
such
world
might
be
created
and
also
that
it
should
be
free
from
old
age
and
unaffected
by
disease
considering
that
if
heat
and
cold
and
other
powerful
forces
which
unite
bodies
surround
and
attack
them
from
without
when
they
are
unprepared
they
decompose
them
and
by
bringing
diseases
and
old
age
upon
them
make
them
waste
away
for
this
cause
and
on
these
grounds
he
made
the
world
one
whole
having
every
part
entire
and
being
therefore
perfect
and
not
liable
to
old
age
and
disease
and
he
gave
to
the
world
the
figure
which
was
suitable
and
also
natural
now
to
the
animal
which
was
to
comprehend
all
animals
that
figure
was
suitable
which
comprehends
within
itself
all
other
figures
wherefore
he
made
the
world
in
the
form
of
a
globe
round
as
from
a
lathe
having
its
extremes
in
every
direction
equidistant
from
the
centre
the
most
perfect
and
the
most
like
itself
of
all
figures
for
he
considered
that
the
like
is
infinitely
fairer
than
the
unlike
this
he
finished
off
making
the
surface
smooth
all
round
for
many
reasons
in
the
first
place
because
the
living
being
had
no
need
of
eyes
when
there
was
nothing
remaining
outside
him
to
be
seen
nor
of
ears
when
there
was
nothing
to
be
heard
and
there
was
no
surrounding
atmosphere
to
be
breathed
nor
would
there
have
been
any
use
of
organs
by
the
help
of
which
he
might
receive
his
food
or
get
rid
of
what
he
had
already
digested
since
there
was
nothing
which
went
from
him
or
came
into
him
for
there
was
nothing
beside
him
of
design
he
was
created
thus
his
own
waste
providing
his
own
food
and
all
that
he
did
or
suffered
taking
place
in
and
by
himself
for
the
creator
conceived
that
a
being
which
was
would
be
far
more
excellent
than
one
which
lacked
anything
and
as
he
had
no
need
to
take
anything
or
defend
himself
against
any
one
the
creator
did
not
think
it
necessary
to
bestow
upon
him
hands
nor
had
he
any
need
of
feet
nor
of
the
whole
apparatus
of
walking
but
the
movement
suited
to
his
spherical
form
was
assigned
to
him
being
of
all
the
seven
that
which
is
most
appropriate
to
mind
and
intelligence
and
he
was
made
to
move
in
the
same
manner
and
on
the
same
spot
within
his
own
limits
revolving
in
a
circle
all
the
other
six
motions
were
taken
away
from
him
and
he
was
made
not
to
partake
of
their
deviations
and
as
this
circular
movement
required
no
feet
the
universe
was
created
without
legs
and
without
feet
such
was
the
whole
plan
of
the
eternal
god
about
the
god
that
was
to
be
to
whom
for
this
reason
he
gave
a
body
smooth
and
even
having
a
surface
in
every
direction
equidistant
from
the
centre
a
body
entire
and
perfect
and
formed
out
of
perfect
bodies
and
in
the
centre
he
put
the
soul
which
he
diffused
throughout
the
body
making
it
also
to
be
the
exterior
environment
of
it
and
he
made
the
universe
a
circle
moving
in
a
circle
one
and
solitary
yet
by
reason
of
its
excellence
able
to
converse
with
itself
and
needing
no
other
friendship
or
acquaintance
having
these
purposes
in
view
he
created
the
world
a
blessed
god
now
god
did
not
make
the
soul
after
the
body
although
we
are
speaking
of
them
in
this
order
for
having
brought
them
together
he
would
never
have
allowed
that
the
elder
should
be
ruled
by
the
younger
but
this
is
a
random
manner
of
speaking
which
we
have
because
somehow
we
ourselves
too
are
very
much
under
the
dominion
of
chance
whereas
he
made
the
soul
in
origin
and
excellence
prior
to
and
older
than
the
body
to
be
the
ruler
and
mistress
of
whom
the
body
was
to
be
the
subject
and
he
made
her
out
of
the
following
elements
and
on
this
wise
out
of
the
indivisible
and
unchangeable
and
also
out
of
that
which
is
divisible
and
has
to
do
with
material
bodies
he
compounded
a
third
and
intermediate
kind
of
essence
partaking
of
the
nature
of
the
same
and
of
the
other
and
this
compound
he
placed
accordingly
in
a
mean
between
the
indivisible
and
the
divisible
and
material
he
took
the
three
elements
of
the
same
the
other
and
the
essence
and
mingled
them
into
one
form
compressing
by
force
the
reluctant
and
unsociable
nature
of
the
other
into
the
same
when
he
had
mingled
them
with
the
essence
and
out
of
three
made
one
he
again
divided
this
whole
into
as
many
portions
as
was
fitting
each
portion
being
a
compound
of
the
same
the
other
and
the
essence
and
he
proceeded
to
divide
after
this
manner
first
of
all
he
took
away
one
part
of
the
whole
and
then
he
separated
a
second
part
which
was
double
the
first
and
then
he
took
away
a
third
part
which
was
half
as
much
again
as
the
second
and
three
times
as
much
as
the
first
and
then
he
took
a
fourth
part
which
was
twice
as
much
as
the
second
and
a
fifth
part
which
was
three
times
the
third
and
a
sixth
part
which
was
eight
times
the
first
and
a
seventh
part
which
was
times
the
first
after
this
he
filled
up
the
double
intervals
between
and
the
triple
between
cutting
off
yet
other
portions
from
the
mixture
and
placing
them
in
the
intervals
so
that
in
each
interval
there
were
two
kinds
of
means
the
one
exceeding
and
exceeded
by
equal
parts
of
its
extremes
as
for
example
in
which
the
mean
is
of
more
than
and
of
less
than
the
other
being
that
kind
of
mean
which
exceeds
and
is
exceeded
by
an
equal
number
over
over
over
over
and
over
over
over
over
where
there
were
intervals
of
and
of
and
of
made
by
the
connecting
terms
in
the
former
intervals
he
filled
up
all
the
intervals
of
with
the
interval
of
leaving
a
fraction
over
and
the
interval
which
this
fraction
expressed
was
in
the
ratio
of
to
and
thus
the
whole
mixture
out
of
which
he
cut
these
portions
was
all
exhausted
by
him
this
entire
compound
he
divided
lengthways
into
two
parts
which
he
joined
to
one
another
at
the
centre
like
the
letter
x
and
bent
them
into
a
circular
form
connecting
them
with
themselves
and
each
other
at
the
point
opposite
to
their
original
and
comprehending
them
in
a
uniform
revolution
upon
the
same
axis
he
made
the
one
the
outer
and
the
other
the
inner
circle
now
the
motion
of
the
outer
circle
he
called
the
motion
of
the
same
and
the
motion
of
the
inner
circle
the
motion
of
the
other
or
diverse
the
motion
of
the
same
he
carried
round
by
the
side
of
the
rectangular
figure
supposed
to
be
inscribed
in
the
circle
of
the
same
to
the
right
and
the
motion
of
the
diverse
diagonally
across
the
rectangular
figure
from
corner
to
corner
to
the
left
and
he
gave
dominion
to
the
motion
of
the
same
and
like
for
that
he
left
single
and
undivided
but
the
inner
motion
he
divided
in
six
places
and
made
seven
unequal
circles
having
their
intervals
in
ratios
of
two
and
three
three
of
each
and
bade
the
orbits
proceed
in
a
direction
opposite
to
one
another
and
three
sun
mercury
venus
he
made
to
move
with
equal
swiftness
and
the
remaining
four
moon
saturn
mars
jupiter
to
move
with
unequal
swiftness
to
the
three
and
to
one
another
but
in
due
proportion
now
when
the
creator
had
framed
the
soul
according
to
his
will
he
formed
within
her
the
corporeal
universe
and
brought
the
two
together
and
united
them
centre
to
centre
the
soul
interfused
everywhere
from
the
centre
to
the
circumference
of
heaven
of
which
also
she
is
the
external
envelopment
herself
turning
in
herself
began
a
divine
beginning
of
and
rational
life
enduring
throughout
all
time
the
body
of
heaven
is
visible
but
the
soul
is
invisible
and
partakes
of
reason
and
harmony
and
being
made
by
the
best
of
intellectual
and
everlasting
natures
is
the
best
of
things
created
and
because
she
is
composed
of
the
same
and
of
the
other
and
of
the
essence
these
three
and
is
divided
and
united
in
due
proportion
and
in
her
revolutions
returns
upon
herself
the
soul
when
touching
anything
which
has
essence
whether
dispersed
in
parts
or
undivided
is
stirred
through
all
her
powers
to
declare
the
sameness
or
difference
of
that
thing
and
some
other
and
to
what
individuals
are
related
and
by
what
affected
and
in
what
way
and
how
and
when
both
in
the
world
of
generation
and
in
the
world
of
immutable
being
and
when
reason
which
works
with
equal
truth
whether
she
be
in
the
circle
of
the
diverse
or
of
the
same
in
voiceless
silence
holding
her
onward
course
in
the
sphere
of
the
when
reason
i
say
is
hovering
around
the
sensible
world
and
when
the
circle
of
the
diverse
also
moving
truly
imparts
the
intimations
of
sense
to
the
whole
soul
then
arise
opinions
and
beliefs
sure
and
certain
but
when
reason
is
concerned
with
the
rational
and
the
circle
of
the
same
moving
smoothly
declares
it
then
intelligence
and
knowledge
are
necessarily
perfected
and
if
any
one
affirms
that
in
which
these
two
are
found
to
be
other
than
the
soul
he
will
say
the
very
opposite
of
the
truth
when
the
father
and
creator
saw
the
creature
which
he
had
made
moving
and
living
the
created
image
of
the
eternal
gods
he
rejoiced
and
in
his
joy
determined
to
make
the
copy
still
more
like
the
original
and
as
this
was
eternal
he
sought
to
make
the
universe
eternal
so
far
as
might
be
now
the
nature
of
the
ideal
being
was
everlasting
but
to
bestow
this
attribute
in
its
fulness
upon
a
creature
was
impossible
wherefore
he
resolved
to
have
a
moving
image
of
eternity
and
when
he
set
in
order
the
heaven
he
made
this
image
eternal
but
moving
according
to
number
while
eternity
itself
rests
in
unity
and
this
image
we
call
time
for
there
were
no
days
and
nights
and
months
and
years
before
the
heaven
was
created
but
when
he
constructed
the
heaven
he
created
them
also
they
are
all
parts
of
time
and
the
past
and
future
are
created
species
of
time
which
we
unconsciously
but
wrongly
transfer
to
the
eternal
essence
for
we
say
that
he
he
he
be
but
the
truth
is
that
alone
is
properly
attributed
to
him
and
that
and
be
are
only
to
be
spoken
of
becoming
in
time
for
they
are
motions
but
that
which
is
immovably
the
same
can
not
become
older
or
younger
by
time
nor
ever
did
or
has
become
or
hereafter
will
be
older
or
younger
nor
is
subject
at
all
to
any
of
those
states
which
affect
moving
and
sensible
things
and
of
which
generation
is
the
cause
these
are
the
forms
of
time
which
imitates
eternity
and
revolves
according
to
a
law
of
number
moreover
when
we
say
that
what
has
become
is
become
and
what
becomes
is
becoming
and
that
what
will
become
is
about
to
become
and
that
the
is
all
these
are
inaccurate
modes
of
expression
compare
but
perhaps
this
whole
subject
will
be
more
suitably
discussed
on
some
other
occasion
time
then
and
the
heaven
came
into
being
at
the
same
instant
in
order
that
having
been
created
together
if
ever
there
was
to
be
a
dissolution
of
them
they
might
be
dissolved
together
it
was
framed
after
the
pattern
of
the
eternal
nature
that
it
might
resemble
this
as
far
as
was
possible
for
the
pattern
exists
from
eternity
and
the
created
heaven
has
been
and
is
and
will
be
in
all
time
such
was
the
mind
and
thought
of
god
in
the
creation
of
time
the
sun
and
moon
and
five
other
stars
which
are
called
the
planets
were
created
by
him
in
order
to
distinguish
and
preserve
the
numbers
of
time
and
when
he
had
made
their
several
bodies
he
placed
them
in
the
orbits
in
which
the
circle
of
the
other
was
revolving
in
seven
orbits
seven
stars
first
there
was
the
moon
in
the
orbit
nearest
the
earth
and
next
the
sun
in
the
second
orbit
above
the
earth
then
came
the
morning
star
and
the
star
sacred
to
hermes
moving
in
orbits
which
have
an
equal
swiftness
with
the
sun
but
in
an
opposite
direction
and
this
is
the
reason
why
the
sun
and
hermes
and
lucifer
overtake
and
are
overtaken
by
each
other
to
enumerate
the
places
which
he
assigned
to
the
other
stars
and
to
give
all
the
reasons
why
he
assigned
them
although
a
secondary
matter
would
give
more
trouble
than
the
primary
these
things
at
some
future
time
when
we
are
at
leisure
may
have
the
consideration
which
they
deserve
but
not
at
present
now
when
all
the
stars
which
were
necessary
to
the
creation
of
time
had
attained
a
motion
suitable
to
them
and
had
become
living
creatures
having
bodies
fastened
by
vital
chains
and
learnt
their
appointed
task
moving
in
the
motion
of
the
diverse
which
is
diagonal
and
passes
through
and
is
governed
by
the
motion
of
the
same
they
revolved
some
in
a
larger
and
some
in
a
lesser
orbit
those
which
had
the
lesser
orbit
revolving
faster
and
those
which
had
the
larger
more
slowly
now
by
reason
of
the
motion
of
the
same
those
which
revolved
fastest
appeared
to
be
overtaken
by
those
which
moved
slower
although
they
really
overtook
them
for
the
motion
of
the
same
made
them
all
turn
in
a
spiral
and
because
some
went
one
way
and
some
another
that
which
receded
most
slowly
from
the
sphere
of
the
same
which
was
the
swiftest
appeared
to
follow
it
most
nearly
that
there
might
be
some
visible
measure
of
their
relative
swiftness
and
slowness
as
they
proceeded
in
their
eight
courses
god
lighted
a
fire
which
we
now
call
the
sun
in
the
second
from
the
earth
of
these
orbits
that
it
might
give
light
to
the
whole
of
heaven
and
that
the
animals
as
many
as
nature
intended
might
participate
in
number
learning
arithmetic
from
the
revolution
of
the
same
and
the
like
thus
then
and
for
this
reason
the
night
and
the
day
were
created
being
the
period
of
the
one
most
intelligent
revolution
and
the
month
is
accomplished
when
the
moon
has
completed
her
orbit
and
overtaken
the
sun
and
the
year
when
the
sun
has
completed
his
own
orbit
mankind
with
hardly
an
exception
have
not
remarked
the
periods
of
the
other
stars
and
they
have
no
name
for
them
and
do
not
measure
them
against
one
another
by
the
help
of
number
and
hence
they
can
scarcely
be
said
to
know
that
their
wanderings
being
infinite
in
number
and
admirable
for
their
variety
make
up
time
and
yet
there
is
no
difficulty
in
seeing
that
the
perfect
number
of
time
fulfils
the
perfect
year
when
all
the
eight
revolutions
having
their
relative
degrees
of
swiftness
are
accomplished
together
and
attain
their
completion
at
the
same
time
measured
by
the
rotation
of
the
same
and
equally
moving
after
this
manner
and
for
these
reasons
came
into
being
such
of
the
stars
as
in
their
heavenly
progress
received
reversals
of
motion
to
the
end
that
the
created
heaven
might
imitate
the
eternal
nature
and
be
as
like
as
possible
to
the
perfect
and
intelligible
animal
thus
far
and
until
the
birth
of
time
the
created
universe
was
made
in
the
likeness
of
the
original
but
inasmuch
as
all
animals
were
not
yet
comprehended
therein
it
was
still
unlike
what
remained
the
creator
then
proceeded
to
fashion
after
the
nature
of
the
pattern
now
as
in
the
ideal
animal
the
mind
perceives
ideas
or
species
of
a
certain
nature
and
number
he
thought
that
this
created
animal
ought
to
have
species
of
a
like
nature
and
number
there
are
four
such
one
of
them
is
the
heavenly
race
of
the
gods
another
the
race
of
birds
whose
way
is
in
the
air
the
third
the
watery
species
and
the
fourth
the
pedestrian
and
land
creatures
of
the
heavenly
and
divine
he
created
the
greater
part
out
of
fire
that
they
might
be
the
brightest
of
all
things
and
fairest
to
behold
and
he
fashioned
them
after
the
likeness
of
the
universe
in
the
figure
of
a
circle
and
made
them
follow
the
intelligent
motion
of
the
supreme
distributing
them
over
the
whole
circumference
of
heaven
which
was
to
be
a
true
cosmos
or
glorious
world
spangled
with
them
all
over
and
he
gave
to
each
of
them
two
movements
the
first
a
movement
on
the
same
spot
after
the
same
manner
whereby
they
ever
continue
to
think
consistently
the
same
thoughts
about
the
same
things
the
second
a
forward
movement
in
which
they
are
controlled
by
the
revolution
of
the
same
and
the
like
but
by
the
other
five
motions
they
were
unaffected
in
order
that
each
of
them
might
attain
the
highest
perfection
and
for
this
reason
the
fixed
stars
were
created
to
be
divine
and
eternal
animals
and
revolving
after
the
same
manner
and
on
the
same
spot
and
the
other
stars
which
reverse
their
motion
and
are
subject
to
deviations
of
this
kind
were
created
in
the
manner
already
described
the
earth
which
is
our
nurse
clinging
or
around
the
pole
which
is
extended
through
the
universe
he
framed
to
be
the
guardian
and
artificer
of
night
and
day
first
and
eldest
of
gods
that
are
in
the
interior
of
heaven
vain
would
be
the
attempt
to
tell
all
the
figures
of
them
circling
as
in
dance
and
their
juxtapositions
and
the
return
of
them
in
their
revolutions
upon
themselves
and
their
approximations
and
to
say
which
of
these
deities
in
their
conjunctions
meet
and
which
of
them
are
in
opposition
and
in
what
order
they
get
behind
and
before
one
another
and
when
they
are
severally
eclipsed
to
our
sight
and
again
reappear
sending
terrors
and
intimations
of
the
future
to
those
who
can
not
calculate
their
movements
to
attempt
to
tell
of
all
this
without
a
visible
representation
of
the
heavenly
system
would
be
labour
in
vain
enough
on
this
head
and
now
let
what
we
have
said
about
the
nature
of
the
created
and
visible
gods
have
an
end
to
know
or
tell
the
origin
of
the
other
divinities
is
beyond
us
and
we
must
accept
the
traditions
of
the
men
of
old
time
who
affirm
themselves
to
be
the
offspring
of
the
gods
that
is
what
they
say
and
they
must
surely
have
known
their
own
ancestors
how
can
we
doubt
the
word
of
the
children
of
the
gods
although
they
give
no
probable
or
certain
proofs
still
as
they
declare
that
they
are
speaking
of
what
took
place
in
their
own
family
we
must
conform
to
custom
and
believe
them
in
this
manner
then
according
to
them
the
genealogy
of
these
gods
is
to
be
received
and
set
forth
oceanus
and
tethys
were
the
children
of
earth
and
heaven
and
from
these
sprang
phorcys
and
cronos
and
rhea
and
all
that
generation
and
from
cronos
and
rhea
sprang
zeus
and
here
and
all
those
who
are
said
to
be
their
brethren
and
others
who
were
the
children
of
these
now
when
all
of
them
both
those
who
visibly
appear
in
their
revolutions
as
well
as
those
other
gods
who
are
of
a
more
retiring
nature
had
come
into
being
the
creator
of
the
universe
addressed
them
in
these
words
children
of
gods
who
are
my
works
and
of
whom
i
am
the
artificer
and
father
my
creations
are
indissoluble
if
so
i
will
all
that
is
bound
may
be
undone
but
only
an
evil
being
would
wish
to
undo
that
which
is
harmonious
and
happy
wherefore
since
ye
are
but
creatures
ye
are
not
altogether
immortal
and
indissoluble
but
ye
shall
certainly
not
be
dissolved
nor
be
liable
to
the
fate
of
death
having
in
my
will
a
greater
and
mightier
bond
than
those
with
which
ye
were
bound
at
the
time
of
your
birth
and
now
listen
to
my
instructions
three
tribes
of
mortal
beings
remain
to
be
created
without
them
the
universe
will
be
incomplete
for
it
will
not
contain
every
kind
of
animal
which
it
ought
to
contain
if
it
is
to
be
perfect
on
the
other
hand
if
they
were
created
by
me
and
received
life
at
my
hands
they
would
be
on
an
equality
with
the
gods
in
order
then
that
they
may
be
mortal
and
that
this
universe
may
be
truly
universal
do
ye
according
to
your
natures
betake
yourselves
to
the
formation
of
animals
imitating
the
power
which
was
shown
by
me
in
creating
you
the
part
of
them
worthy
of
the
name
immortal
which
is
called
divine
and
is
the
guiding
principle
of
those
who
are
willing
to
follow
justice
and
you
of
that
divine
part
i
will
myself
sow
the
seed
and
having
made
a
beginning
i
will
hand
the
work
over
to
you
and
do
ye
then
interweave
the
mortal
with
the
immortal
and
make
and
beget
living
creatures
and
give
them
food
and
make
them
to
grow
and
receive
them
again
in
death
thus
he
spake
and
once
more
into
the
cup
in
which
he
had
previously
mingled
the
soul
of
the
universe
he
poured
the
remains
of
the
elements
and
mingled
them
in
much
the
same
manner
they
were
not
however
pure
as
before
but
diluted
to
the
second
and
third
degree
and
having
made
it
he
divided
the
whole
mixture
into
souls
equal
in
number
to
the
stars
and
assigned
each
soul
to
a
star
and
having
there
placed
them
as
in
a
chariot
he
showed
them
the
nature
of
the
universe
and
declared
to
them
the
laws
of
destiny
according
to
which
their
first
birth
would
be
one
and
the
same
for
all
no
one
should
suffer
a
disadvantage
at
his
hands
they
were
to
be
sown
in
the
instruments
of
time
severally
adapted
to
them
and
to
come
forth
the
most
religious
of
animals
and
as
human
nature
was
of
two
kinds
the
superior
race
would
hereafter
be
called
man
now
when
they
should
be
implanted
in
bodies
by
necessity
and
be
always
gaining
or
losing
some
part
of
their
bodily
substance
then
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
necessary
that
they
should
all
have
in
them
one
and
the
same
faculty
of
sensation
arising
out
of
irresistible
impressions
in
the
second
place
they
must
have
love
in
which
pleasure
and
pain
mingle
also
fear
and
anger
and
the
feelings
which
are
akin
or
opposite
to
them
if
they
conquered
these
they
would
live
righteously
and
if
they
were
conquered
by
them
unrighteously
he
who
lived
well
during
his
appointed
time
was
to
return
and
dwell
in
his
native
star
and
there
he
would
have
a
blessed
and
congenial
existence
but
if
he
failed
in
attaining
this
at
the
second
birth
he
would
pass
into
a
woman
and
if
when
in
that
state
of
being
he
did
not
desist
from
evil
he
would
continually
be
changed
into
some
brute
who
resembled
him
in
the
evil
nature
which
he
had
acquired
and
would
not
cease
from
his
toils
and
transformations
until
he
followed
the
revolution
of
the
same
and
the
like
within
him
and
overcame
by
the
help
of
reason
the
turbulent
and
irrational
mob
of
later
accretions
made
up
of
fire
and
air
and
water
and
earth
and
returned
to
the
form
of
his
first
and
better
state
having
given
all
these
laws
to
his
creatures
that
he
might
be
guiltless
of
future
evil
in
any
of
them
the
creator
sowed
some
of
them
in
the
earth
and
some
in
the
moon
and
some
in
the
other
instruments
of
time
and
when
he
had
sown
them
he
committed
to
the
younger
gods
the
fashioning
of
their
mortal
bodies
and
desired
them
to
furnish
what
was
still
lacking
to
the
human
soul
and
having
made
all
the
suitable
additions
to
rule
over
them
and
to
pilot
the
mortal
animal
in
the
best
and
wisest
manner
which
they
could
and
avert
from
him
all
but
evils
when
the
creator
had
made
all
these
ordinances
he
remained
in
his
own
accustomed
nature
and
his
children
heard
and
were
obedient
to
their
father
word
and
receiving
from
him
the
immortal
principle
of
a
mortal
creature
in
imitation
of
their
own
creator
they
borrowed
portions
of
fire
and
earth
and
water
and
air
from
the
world
which
were
hereafter
to
be
restored
these
they
took
and
welded
them
together
not
with
the
indissoluble
chains
by
which
they
were
themselves
bound
but
with
little
pegs
too
small
to
be
visible
making
up
out
of
all
the
four
elements
each
separate
body
and
fastening
the
courses
of
the
immortal
soul
in
a
body
which
was
in
a
state
of
perpetual
influx
and
efflux
now
these
courses
detained
as
in
a
vast
river
neither
overcame
nor
were
overcome
but
were
hurrying
and
hurried
to
and
fro
so
that
the
whole
animal
was
moved
and
progressed
irregularly
however
and
irrationally
and
anyhow
in
all
the
six
directions
of
motion
wandering
backwards
and
forwards
and
right
and
left
and
up
and
down
and
in
all
the
six
directions
for
great
as
was
the
advancing
and
retiring
flood
which
provided
nourishment
the
affections
produced
by
external
contact
caused
still
greater
tumult
when
the
body
of
any
one
met
and
came
into
collision
with
some
external
fire
or
with
the
solid
earth
or
the
gliding
waters
or
was
caught
in
the
tempest
borne
on
the
air
and
the
motions
produced
by
any
of
these
impulses
were
carried
through
the
body
to
the
soul
all
such
motions
have
consequently
received
the
general
name
of
which
they
still
retain
and
they
did
in
fact
at
that
time
create
a
very
great
and
mighty
movement
uniting
with
the
stream
in
stirring
up
and
violently
shaking
the
courses
of
the
soul
they
completely
stopped
the
revolution
of
the
same
by
their
opposing
current
and
hindered
it
from
predominating
and
advancing
and
they
so
disturbed
the
nature
of
the
other
or
diverse
that
the
three
double
intervals
between
and
the
three
triple
intervals
between
together
with
the
mean
terms
and
connecting
links
which
are
expressed
by
the
ratios
of
and
and
of
these
although
they
can
not
be
wholly
undone
except
by
him
who
united
them
were
twisted
by
them
in
all
sorts
of
ways
and
the
circles
were
broken
and
disordered
in
every
possible
manner
so
that
when
they
moved
they
were
tumbling
to
pieces
and
moved
irrationally
at
one
time
in
a
reverse
direction
and
then
again
obliquely
and
then
upside
down
as
you
might
imagine
a
person
who
is
upside
down
and
has
his
head
leaning
upon
the
ground
and
his
feet
up
against
something
in
the
air
and
when
he
is
in
such
a
position
both
he
and
the
spectator
fancy
that
the
right
of
either
is
his
left
and
the
left
right
if
when
powerfully
experiencing
these
and
similar
effects
the
revolutions
of
the
soul
come
in
contact
with
some
external
thing
either
of
the
class
of
the
same
or
of
the
other
they
speak
of
the
same
or
of
the
other
in
a
manner
the
very
opposite
of
the
truth
and
they
become
false
and
foolish
and
there
is
no
course
or
revolution
in
them
which
has
a
guiding
or
directing
power
and
if
again
any
sensations
enter
in
violently
from
without
and
drag
after
them
the
whole
vessel
of
the
soul
then
the
courses
of
the
soul
though
they
seem
to
conquer
are
really
conquered
and
by
reason
of
all
these
affections
the
soul
when
encased
in
a
mortal
body
now
as
in
the
beginning
is
at
first
without
intelligence
but
when
the
flood
of
growth
and
nutriment
abates
and
the
courses
of
the
soul
calming
down
go
their
own
way
and
become
steadier
as
time
goes
on
then
the
several
circles
return
to
their
natural
form
and
their
revolutions
are
corrected
and
they
call
the
same
and
the
other
by
their
right
names
and
make
the
possessor
of
them
to
become
a
rational
being
and
if
these
combine
in
him
with
any
true
nurture
or
education
he
attains
the
fulness
and
health
of
the
perfect
man
and
escapes
the
worst
disease
of
all
but
if
he
neglects
education
he
walks
lame
to
the
end
of
his
life
and
returns
imperfect
and
good
for
nothing
to
the
world
below
this
however
is
a
later
stage
at
present
we
must
treat
more
exactly
the
subject
before
us
which
involves
a
preliminary
enquiry
into
the
generation
of
the
body
and
its
members
and
as
to
how
the
soul
was
created
for
what
reason
and
by
what
providence
of
the
gods
and
holding
fast
to
probability
we
must
pursue
our
way
first
then
the
gods
imitating
the
spherical
shape
of
the
universe
enclosed
the
two
divine
courses
in
a
spherical
body
that
namely
which
we
now
term
the
head
being
the
most
divine
part
of
us
and
the
lord
of
all
that
is
in
us
to
this
the
gods
when
they
put
together
the
body
gave
all
the
other
members
to
be
servants
considering
that
it
partook
of
every
sort
of
motion
in
order
then
that
it
might
not
tumble
about
among
the
high
and
deep
places
of
the
earth
but
might
be
able
to
get
over
the
one
and
out
of
the
other
they
provided
the
body
to
be
its
vehicle
and
means
of
locomotion
which
consequently
had
length
and
was
furnished
with
four
limbs
extended
and
flexible
these
god
contrived
to
be
instruments
of
locomotion
with
which
it
might
take
hold
and
find
support
and
so
be
able
to
pass
through
all
places
carrying
on
high
the
of
the
most
sacred
and
divine
part
of
us
such
was
the
origin
of
legs
and
hands
which
for
this
reason
were
attached
to
every
man
and
the
gods
deeming
the
front
part
of
man
to
be
more
honourable
and
more
fit
to
command
than
the
hinder
part
made
us
to
move
mostly
in
a
forward
direction
wherefore
man
must
needs
have
his
front
part
unlike
and
distinguished
from
the
rest
of
his
body
and
so
in
the
vessel
of
the
head
they
first
of
all
put
a
face
in
which
they
inserted
organs
to
minister
in
all
things
to
the
providence
of
the
soul
and
they
appointed
this
part
which
has
authority
to
be
by
nature
the
part
which
is
in
front
and
of
the
organs
they
first
contrived
the
eyes
to
give
light
and
the
principle
according
to
which
they
were
inserted
was
as
follows
so
much
of
fire
as
would
not
burn
but
gave
a
gentle
light
they
formed
into
a
substance
akin
to
the
light
of
life
and
the
pure
fire
which
is
within
us
and
related
thereto
they
made
to
flow
through
the
eyes
in
a
stream
smooth
and
dense
compressing
the
whole
eye
and
especially
the
centre
part
so
that
it
kept
out
everything
of
a
coarser
nature
and
allowed
to
pass
only
this
pure
element
when
the
light
of
day
surrounds
the
stream
of
vision
then
like
falls
upon
like
and
they
coalesce
and
one
body
is
formed
by
natural
affinity
in
the
line
of
vision
wherever
the
light
that
falls
from
within
meets
with
an
external
object
and
the
whole
stream
of
vision
being
similarly
affected
in
virtue
of
similarity
diffuses
the
motions
of
what
it
touches
or
what
touches
it
over
the
whole
body
until
they
reach
the
soul
causing
that
perception
which
we
call
sight
but
when
night
comes
on
and
the
external
and
kindred
fire
departs
then
the
stream
of
vision
is
cut
off
for
going
forth
to
an
unlike
element
it
is
changed
and
extinguished
being
no
longer
of
one
nature
with
the
surrounding
atmosphere
which
is
now
deprived
of
fire
and
so
the
eye
no
longer
sees
and
we
feel
disposed
to
sleep
for
when
the
eyelids
which
the
gods
invented
for
the
preservation
of
sight
are
closed
they
keep
in
the
internal
fire
and
the
power
of
the
fire
diffuses
and
equalizes
the
inward
motions
when
they
are
equalized
there
is
rest
and
when
the
rest
is
profound
sleep
comes
over
us
scarce
disturbed
by
dreams
but
where
the
greater
motions
still
remain
of
whatever
nature
and
in
whatever
locality
they
engender
corresponding
visions
in
dreams
which
are
remembered
by
us
when
we
are
awake
and
in
the
external
world
and
now
there
is
no
longer
any
difficulty
in
understanding
the
creation
of
images
in
mirrors
and
all
smooth
and
bright
surfaces
for
from
the
communion
of
the
internal
and
external
fires
and
again
from
the
union
of
them
and
their
numerous
transformations
when
they
meet
in
the
mirror
all
these
appearances
of
necessity
arise
when
the
fire
from
the
face
coalesces
with
the
fire
from
the
eye
on
the
bright
and
smooth
surface
and
right
appears
left
and
left
right
because
the
visual
rays
come
into
contact
with
the
rays
emitted
by
the
object
in
a
manner
contrary
to
the
usual
mode
of
meeting
but
the
right
appears
right
and
the
left
left
when
the
position
of
one
of
the
two
concurring
lights
is
reversed
and
this
happens
when
the
mirror
is
concave
and
its
smooth
surface
repels
the
right
stream
of
vision
to
the
left
side
and
the
left
to
the
right
he
is
speaking
of
two
kinds
of
mirrors
first
the
plane
secondly
the
concave
and
the
latter
is
supposed
to
be
placed
first
horizontally
and
then
or
if
the
mirror
be
turned
vertically
then
the
concavity
makes
the
countenance
appear
to
be
all
upside
down
and
the
lower
rays
are
driven
upwards
and
the
upper
downwards
all
these
are
to
be
reckoned
among
the
second
and
causes
which
god
carrying
into
execution
the
idea
of
the
best
as
far
as
possible
uses
as
his
ministers
they
are
thought
by
most
men
not
to
be
the
second
but
the
prime
causes
of
all
things
because
they
freeze
and
heat
and
contract
and
dilate
and
the
like
but
they
are
not
so
for
they
are
incapable
of
reason
or
intellect
the
only
being
which
can
properly
have
mind
is
the
invisible
soul
whereas
fire
and
water
and
earth
and
air
are
all
of
them
visible
bodies
the
lover
of
intellect
and
knowledge
ought
to
explore
causes
of
intelligent
nature
first
of
all
and
secondly
of
those
things
which
being
moved
by
others
are
compelled
to
move
others
and
this
is
what
we
too
must
do
both
kinds
of
causes
should
be
acknowledged
by
us
but
a
distinction
should
be
made
between
those
which
are
endowed
with
mind
and
are
the
workers
of
things
fair
and
good
and
those
which
are
deprived
of
intelligence
and
always
produce
chance
effects
without
order
or
design
of
the
second
or
causes
of
sight
which
help
to
give
to
the
eyes
the
power
which
they
now
possess
enough
has
been
said
i
will
therefore
now
proceed
to
speak
of
the
higher
use
and
purpose
for
which
god
has
given
them
to
us
the
sight
in
my
opinion
is
the
source
of
the
greatest
benefit
to
us
for
had
we
never
seen
the
stars
and
the
sun
and
the
heaven
none
of
the
words
which
we
have
spoken
about
the
universe
would
ever
have
been
uttered
but
now
the
sight
of
day
and
night
and
the
months
and
the
revolutions
of
the
years
have
created
number
and
have
given
us
a
conception
of
time
and
the
power
of
enquiring
about
the
nature
of
the
universe
and
from
this
source
we
have
derived
philosophy
than
which
no
greater
good
ever
was
or
will
be
given
by
the
gods
to
mortal
man
this
is
the
greatest
boon
of
sight
and
of
the
lesser
benefits
why
should
i
speak
even
the
ordinary
man
if
he
were
deprived
of
them
would
bewail
his
loss
but
in
vain
thus
much
let
me
say
however
god
invented
and
gave
us
sight
to
the
end
that
we
might
behold
the
courses
of
intelligence
in
the
heaven
and
apply
them
to
the
courses
of
our
own
intelligence
which
are
akin
to
them
the
unperturbed
to
the
perturbed
and
that
we
learning
them
and
partaking
of
the
natural
truth
of
reason
might
imitate
the
absolutely
unerring
courses
of
god
and
regulate
our
own
vagaries
the
same
may
be
affirmed
of
speech
and
hearing
they
have
been
given
by
the
gods
to
the
same
end
and
for
a
like
reason
for
this
is
the
principal
end
of
speech
whereto
it
most
contributes
moreover
so
much
of
music
as
is
adapted
to
the
sound
of
the
voice
and
to
the
sense
of
hearing
is
granted
to
us
for
the
sake
of
harmony
and
harmony
which
has
motions
akin
to
the
revolutions
of
our
souls
is
not
regarded
by
the
intelligent
votary
of
the
muses
as
given
by
them
with
a
view
to
irrational
pleasure
which
is
deemed
to
be
the
purpose
of
it
in
our
day
but
as
meant
to
correct
any
discord
which
may
have
arisen
in
the
courses
of
the
soul
and
to
be
our
ally
in
bringing
her
into
harmony
and
agreement
with
herself
and
rhythm
too
was
given
by
them
for
the
same
reason
on
account
of
the
irregular
and
graceless
ways
which
prevail
among
mankind
generally
and
to
help
us
against
them
thus
far
in
what
we
have
been
saying
with
small
exception
the
works
of
intelligence
have
been
set
forth
and
now
we
must
place
by
the
side
of
them
in
our
discourse
the
things
which
come
into
being
through
necessity
for
the
creation
is
mixed
being
made
up
of
necessity
and
mind
mind
the
ruling
power
persuaded
necessity
to
bring
the
greater
part
of
created
things
to
perfection
and
thus
and
after
this
manner
in
the
beginning
when
the
influence
of
reason
got
the
better
of
necessity
the
universe
was
created
but
if
a
person
will
truly
tell
of
the
way
in
which
the
work
was
accomplished
he
must
include
the
other
influence
of
the
variable
cause
as
well
wherefore
we
must
return
again
and
find
another
suitable
beginning
as
about
the
former
matters
so
also
about
these
to
which
end
we
must
consider
the
nature
of
fire
and
water
and
air
and
earth
such
as
they
were
prior
to
the
creation
of
the
heaven
and
what
was
happening
to
them
in
this
previous
state
for
no
one
has
as
yet
explained
the
manner
of
their
generation
but
we
speak
of
fire
and
the
rest
of
them
whatever
they
mean
as
though
men
knew
their
natures
and
we
maintain
them
to
be
the
first
principles
and
letters
or
elements
of
the
whole
when
they
can
not
reasonably
be
compared
by
a
man
of
any
sense
even
to
syllables
or
first
compounds
and
let
me
say
thus
much
i
will
not
now
speak
of
the
first
principle
or
principles
of
all
things
or
by
whatever
name
they
are
to
be
called
for
this
reason
because
it
is
difficult
to
set
forth
my
opinion
according
to
the
method
of
discussion
which
we
are
at
present
employing
do
not
imagine
any
more
than
i
can
bring
myself
to
imagine
that
i
should
be
right
in
undertaking
so
great
and
difficult
a
task
remembering
what
i
said
at
first
about
probability
i
will
do
my
best
to
give
as
probable
an
explanation
as
any
other
or
rather
more
probable
and
i
will
first
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
try
to
speak
of
each
thing
and
of
all
once
more
then
at
the
commencement
of
my
discourse
i
call
upon
god
and
beg
him
to
be
our
saviour
out
of
a
strange
and
unwonted
enquiry
and
to
bring
us
to
the
haven
of
probability
so
now
let
us
begin
again
this
new
beginning
of
our
discussion
of
the
universe
requires
a
fuller
division
than
the
former
for
then
we
made
two
classes
now
a
third
must
be
revealed
the
two
sufficed
for
the
former
discussion
one
which
we
assumed
was
a
pattern
intelligible
and
always
the
same
and
the
second
was
only
the
imitation
of
the
pattern
generated
and
visible
there
is
also
a
third
kind
which
we
did
not
distinguish
at
the
time
conceiving
that
the
two
would
be
enough
but
now
the
argument
seems
to
require
that
we
should
set
forth
in
words
another
kind
which
is
difficult
of
explanation
and
dimly
seen
what
nature
are
we
to
attribute
to
this
new
kind
of
being
we
reply
that
it
is
the
receptacle
and
in
a
manner
the
nurse
of
all
generation
i
have
spoken
the
truth
but
i
must
express
myself
in
clearer
language
and
this
will
be
an
arduous
task
for
many
reasons
and
in
particular
because
i
must
first
raise
questions
concerning
fire
and
the
other
elements
and
determine
what
each
of
them
is
for
to
say
with
any
probability
or
certitude
which
of
them
should
be
called
water
rather
than
fire
and
which
should
be
called
any
of
them
rather
than
all
or
some
one
of
them
is
a
difficult
matter
how
then
shall
we
settle
this
point
and
what
questions
about
the
elements
may
be
fairly
raised
in
the
first
place
we
see
that
what
we
just
now
called
water
by
condensation
i
suppose
becomes
stone
and
earth
and
this
same
element
when
melted
and
dispersed
passes
into
vapour
and
air
air
again
when
inflamed
becomes
fire
and
again
fire
when
condensed
and
extinguished
passes
once
more
into
the
form
of
air
and
once
more
air
when
collected
and
condensed
produces
cloud
and
mist
and
from
these
when
still
more
compressed
comes
flowing
water
and
from
water
comes
earth
and
stones
once
more
and
thus
generation
appears
to
be
transmitted
from
one
to
the
other
in
a
circle
thus
then
as
the
several
elements
never
present
themselves
in
the
same
form
how
can
any
one
have
the
assurance
to
assert
positively
that
any
of
them
whatever
it
may
be
is
one
thing
rather
than
another
no
one
can
but
much
the
safest
plan
is
to
speak
of
them
as
follows
anything
which
we
see
to
be
continually
changing
as
for
example
fire
we
must
not
call
or
but
rather
say
that
it
is
such
a
nature
nor
let
us
speak
of
water
as
but
always
as
nor
must
we
imply
that
there
is
any
stability
in
any
of
those
things
which
we
indicate
by
the
use
of
the
words
and
supposing
ourselves
to
signify
something
thereby
for
they
are
too
volatile
to
be
detained
in
any
such
expressions
as
or
or
to
this
or
any
other
mode
of
speaking
which
represents
them
as
permanent
we
ought
not
to
apply
to
any
of
them
but
rather
the
word
which
expresses
the
similar
principle
circulating
in
each
and
all
of
them
for
example
that
should
be
called
which
is
of
such
a
nature
always
and
so
of
everything
that
has
generation
that
in
which
the
elements
severally
grow
up
and
appear
and
decay
is
alone
to
be
called
by
the
name
or
but
that
which
is
of
a
certain
nature
hot
or
white
or
anything
which
admits
of
opposite
qualities
and
all
things
that
are
compounded
of
them
ought
not
to
be
so
denominated
let
me
make
another
attempt
to
explain
my
meaning
more
clearly
suppose
a
person
to
make
all
kinds
of
figures
of
gold
and
to
be
always
transmuting
one
form
into
all
the
rest
somebody
points
to
one
of
them
and
asks
what
it
is
by
far
the
safest
and
truest
answer
is
that
is
gold
and
not
to
call
the
triangle
or
any
other
figures
which
are
formed
in
the
gold
as
though
they
had
existence
since
they
are
in
process
of
change
while
he
is
making
the
assertion
but
if
the
questioner
be
willing
to
take
the
safe
and
indefinite
expression
we
should
be
satisfied
and
the
same
argument
applies
to
the
universal
nature
which
receives
all
bodies
that
must
be
always
called
the
same
for
while
receiving
all
things
she
never
departs
at
all
from
her
own
nature
and
never
in
any
way
or
at
any
time
assumes
a
form
like
that
of
any
of
the
things
which
enter
into
her
she
is
the
natural
recipient
of
all
impressions
and
is
stirred
and
informed
by
them
and
appears
different
from
time
to
time
by
reason
of
them
but
the
forms
which
enter
into
and
go
out
of
her
are
the
likenesses
of
real
existences
modelled
after
their
patterns
in
a
wonderful
and
inexplicable
manner
which
we
will
hereafter
investigate
for
the
present
we
have
only
to
conceive
of
three
natures
first
that
which
is
in
process
of
generation
secondly
that
in
which
the
generation
takes
place
and
thirdly
that
of
which
the
thing
generated
is
a
resemblance
and
we
may
liken
the
receiving
principle
to
a
mother
and
the
source
or
spring
to
a
father
and
the
intermediate
nature
to
a
child
and
may
remark
further
that
if
the
model
is
to
take
every
variety
of
form
then
the
matter
in
which
the
model
is
fashioned
will
not
be
duly
prepared
unless
it
is
formless
and
free
from
the
impress
of
any
of
those
shapes
which
it
is
hereafter
to
receive
from
without
for
if
the
matter
were
like
any
of
the
supervening
forms
then
whenever
any
opposite
or
entirely
different
nature
was
stamped
upon
its
surface
it
would
take
the
impression
badly
because
it
would
intrude
its
own
shape
wherefore
that
which
is
to
receive
all
forms
should
have
no
form
as
in
making
perfumes
they
first
contrive
that
the
liquid
substance
which
is
to
receive
the
scent
shall
be
as
inodorous
as
possible
or
as
those
who
wish
to
impress
figures
on
soft
substances
do
not
allow
any
previous
impression
to
remain
but
begin
by
making
the
surface
as
even
and
smooth
as
possible
in
the
same
way
that
which
is
to
receive
perpetually
and
through
its
whole
extent
the
resemblances
of
all
eternal
beings
ought
to
be
devoid
of
any
particular
form
wherefore
the
mother
and
receptacle
of
all
created
and
visible
and
in
any
way
sensible
things
is
not
to
be
termed
earth
or
air
or
fire
or
water
or
any
of
their
compounds
or
any
of
the
elements
from
which
these
are
derived
but
is
an
invisible
and
formless
being
which
receives
all
things
and
in
some
mysterious
way
partakes
of
the
intelligible
and
is
most
incomprehensible
in
saying
this
we
shall
not
be
far
wrong
as
far
however
as
we
can
attain
to
a
knowledge
of
her
from
the
previous
considerations
we
may
truly
say
that
fire
is
that
part
of
her
nature
which
from
time
to
time
is
inflamed
and
water
that
which
is
moistened
and
that
the
mother
substance
becomes
earth
and
air
in
so
far
as
she
receives
the
impressions
of
them
let
us
consider
this
question
more
precisely
is
there
any
fire
and
do
all
those
things
which
we
call
exist
or
are
only
those
things
which
we
see
or
in
some
way
perceive
through
the
bodily
organs
truly
existent
and
nothing
whatever
besides
them
and
is
all
that
which
we
call
an
intelligible
essence
nothing
at
all
and
only
a
name
here
is
a
question
which
we
must
not
leave
unexamined
or
undetermined
nor
must
we
affirm
too
confidently
that
there
can
be
no
decision
neither
must
we
interpolate
in
our
present
long
discourse
a
digression
equally
long
but
if
it
is
possible
to
set
forth
a
great
principle
in
a
few
words
that
is
just
what
we
want
thus
i
state
my
view
if
mind
and
true
opinion
are
two
distinct
classes
then
i
say
that
there
certainly
are
these
ideas
unperceived
by
sense
and
apprehended
only
by
the
mind
if
however
as
some
say
true
opinion
differs
in
no
respect
from
mind
then
everything
that
we
perceive
through
the
body
is
to
be
regarded
as
most
real
and
certain
but
we
must
affirm
them
to
be
distinct
for
they
have
a
distinct
origin
and
are
of
a
different
nature
the
one
is
implanted
in
us
by
instruction
the
other
by
persuasion
the
one
is
always
accompanied
by
true
reason
the
other
is
without
reason
the
one
can
not
be
overcome
by
persuasion
but
the
other
can
and
lastly
every
man
may
be
said
to
share
in
true
opinion
but
mind
is
the
attribute
of
the
gods
and
of
very
few
men
wherefore
also
we
must
acknowledge
that
there
is
one
kind
of
being
which
is
always
the
same
uncreated
and
indestructible
never
receiving
anything
into
itself
from
without
nor
itself
going
out
to
any
other
but
invisible
and
imperceptible
by
any
sense
and
of
which
the
contemplation
is
granted
to
intelligence
only
and
there
is
another
nature
of
the
same
name
with
it
and
like
to
it
perceived
by
sense
created
always
in
motion
becoming
in
place
and
again
vanishing
out
of
place
which
is
apprehended
by
opinion
and
sense
and
there
is
a
third
nature
which
is
space
and
is
eternal
and
admits
not
of
destruction
and
provides
a
home
for
all
created
things
and
is
apprehended
without
the
help
of
sense
by
a
kind
of
spurious
reason
and
is
hardly
real
which
we
beholding
as
in
a
dream
say
of
all
existence
that
it
must
of
necessity
be
in
some
place
and
occupy
a
space
but
that
what
is
neither
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
has
no
existence
of
these
and
other
things
of
the
same
kind
relating
to
the
true
and
waking
reality
of
nature
we
have
only
this
dreamlike
sense
and
we
are
unable
to
cast
off
sleep
and
determine
the
truth
about
them
for
an
image
since
the
reality
after
which
it
is
modelled
does
not
belong
to
it
and
it
exists
ever
as
the
fleeting
shadow
of
some
other
must
be
inferred
to
be
in
another
in
space
grasping
existence
in
some
way
or
other
or
it
could
not
be
at
all
but
true
and
exact
reason
vindicating
the
nature
of
true
being
maintains
that
while
two
things
the
image
and
space
are
different
they
can
not
exist
one
of
them
in
the
other
and
so
be
one
and
also
two
at
the
same
time
thus
have
i
concisely
given
the
result
of
my
thoughts
and
my
verdict
is
that
being
and
space
and
generation
these
three
existed
in
their
three
ways
before
the
heaven
and
that
the
nurse
of
generation
moistened
by
water
and
inflamed
by
fire
and
receiving
the
forms
of
earth
and
air
and
experiencing
all
the
affections
which
accompany
these
presented
a
strange
variety
of
appearances
and
being
full
of
powers
which
were
neither
similar
nor
equally
balanced
was
never
in
any
part
in
a
state
of
equipoise
but
swaying
unevenly
hither
and
thither
was
shaken
by
them
and
by
its
motion
again
shook
them
and
the
elements
when
moved
were
separated
and
carried
continually
some
one
way
some
another
as
when
grain
is
shaken
and
winnowed
by
fans
and
other
instruments
used
in
the
threshing
of
corn
the
close
and
heavy
particles
are
borne
away
and
settle
in
one
direction
and
the
loose
and
light
particles
in
another
in
this
manner
the
four
kinds
or
elements
were
then
shaken
by
the
receiving
vessel
which
moving
like
a
winnowing
machine
scattered
far
away
from
one
another
the
elements
most
unlike
and
forced
the
most
similar
elements
into
close
contact
wherefore
also
the
various
elements
had
different
places
before
they
were
arranged
so
as
to
form
the
universe
at
first
they
were
all
without
reason
and
measure
but
when
the
world
began
to
get
into
order
fire
and
water
and
earth
and
air
had
only
certain
faint
traces
of
themselves
and
were
altogether
such
as
everything
might
be
expected
to
be
in
the
absence
of
god
this
i
say
was
their
nature
at
that
time
and
god
fashioned
them
by
form
and
number
let
it
be
consistently
maintained
by
us
in
all
that
we
say
that
god
made
them
as
far
as
possible
the
fairest
and
best
out
of
things
which
were
not
fair
and
good
and
now
i
will
endeavour
to
show
you
the
disposition
and
generation
of
them
by
an
unaccustomed
argument
which
i
am
compelled
to
use
but
i
believe
that
you
will
be
able
to
follow
me
for
your
education
has
made
you
familiar
with
the
methods
of
science
in
the
first
place
then
as
is
evident
to
all
fire
and
earth
and
water
and
air
are
bodies
and
every
sort
of
body
possesses
solidity
and
every
solid
must
necessarily
be
contained
in
planes
and
every
plane
rectilinear
figure
is
composed
of
triangles
and
all
triangles
are
originally
of
two
kinds
both
of
which
are
made
up
of
one
right
and
two
acute
angles
one
of
them
has
at
either
end
of
the
base
the
half
of
a
divided
right
angle
having
equal
sides
while
in
the
other
the
right
angle
is
divided
into
unequal
parts
having
unequal
sides
these
then
proceeding
by
a
combination
of
probability
with
demonstration
we
assume
to
be
the
original
elements
of
fire
and
the
other
bodies
but
the
principles
which
are
prior
to
these
god
only
knows
and
he
of
men
who
is
the
friend
of
god
and
next
we
have
to
determine
what
are
the
four
most
beautiful
bodies
which
are
unlike
one
another
and
of
which
some
are
capable
of
resolution
into
one
another
for
having
discovered
thus
much
we
shall
know
the
true
origin
of
earth
and
fire
and
of
the
proportionate
and
intermediate
elements
and
then
we
shall
not
be
willing
to
allow
that
there
are
any
distinct
kinds
of
visible
bodies
fairer
than
these
wherefore
we
must
endeavour
to
construct
the
four
forms
of
bodies
which
excel
in
beauty
and
then
we
shall
be
able
to
say
that
we
have
sufficiently
apprehended
their
nature
now
of
the
two
triangles
the
isosceles
has
one
form
only
the
scalene
or
has
an
infinite
number
of
the
infinite
forms
we
must
select
the
most
beautiful
if
we
are
to
proceed
in
due
order
and
any
one
who
can
point
out
a
more
beautiful
form
than
ours
for
the
construction
of
these
bodies
shall
carry
off
the
palm
not
as
an
enemy
but
as
a
friend
now
the
one
which
we
maintain
to
be
the
most
beautiful
of
all
the
many
triangles
and
we
need
not
speak
of
the
others
is
that
of
which
the
double
forms
a
third
triangle
which
is
equilateral
the
reason
of
this
would
be
long
to
tell
he
who
disproves
what
we
are
saying
and
shows
that
we
are
mistaken
may
claim
a
friendly
victory
then
let
us
choose
two
triangles
out
of
which
fire
and
the
other
elements
have
been
constructed
one
isosceles
the
other
having
the
square
of
the
longer
side
equal
to
three
times
the
square
of
the
lesser
side
now
is
the
time
to
explain
what
was
before
obscurely
said
there
was
an
error
in
imagining
that
all
the
four
elements
might
be
generated
by
and
into
one
another
this
i
say
was
an
erroneous
supposition
for
there
are
generated
from
the
triangles
which
we
have
selected
four
kinds
three
from
the
one
which
has
the
sides
unequal
the
fourth
alone
is
framed
out
of
the
isosceles
triangle
hence
they
can
not
all
be
resolved
into
one
another
a
great
number
of
small
bodies
being
combined
into
a
few
large
ones
or
the
converse
but
three
of
them
can
be
thus
resolved
and
compounded
for
they
all
spring
from
one
and
when
the
greater
bodies
are
broken
up
many
small
bodies
will
spring
up
out
of
them
and
take
their
own
proper
figures
or
again
when
many
small
bodies
are
dissolved
into
their
triangles
if
they
become
one
they
will
form
one
large
mass
of
another
kind
so
much
for
their
passage
into
one
another
i
have
now
to
speak
of
their
several
kinds
and
show
out
of
what
combinations
of
numbers
each
of
them
was
formed
the
first
will
be
the
simplest
and
smallest
construction
and
its
element
is
that
triangle
which
has
its
hypotenuse
twice
the
lesser
side
when
two
such
triangles
are
joined
at
the
diagonal
and
this
is
repeated
three
times
and
the
triangles
rest
their
diagonals
and
shorter
sides
on
the
same
point
as
a
centre
a
single
equilateral
triangle
is
formed
out
of
six
triangles
and
four
equilateral
triangles
if
put
together
make
out
of
every
three
plane
angles
one
solid
angle
being
that
which
is
nearest
to
the
most
obtuse
of
plane
angles
and
out
of
the
combination
of
these
four
angles
arises
the
first
solid
form
which
distributes
into
equal
and
similar
parts
the
whole
circle
in
which
it
is
inscribed
the
second
species
of
solid
is
formed
out
of
the
same
triangles
which
unite
as
eight
equilateral
triangles
and
form
one
solid
angle
out
of
four
plane
angles
and
out
of
six
such
angles
the
second
body
is
completed
and
the
third
body
is
made
up
of
triangular
elements
forming
twelve
solid
angles
each
of
them
included
in
five
plane
equilateral
triangles
having
altogether
twenty
bases
each
of
which
is
an
equilateral
triangle
the
one
element
that
is
the
triangle
which
has
its
hypotenuse
twice
the
lesser
side
having
generated
these
figures
generated
no
more
but
the
isosceles
triangle
produced
the
fourth
elementary
figure
which
is
compounded
of
four
such
triangles
joining
their
right
angles
in
a
centre
and
forming
one
equilateral
quadrangle
six
of
these
united
form
eight
solid
angles
each
of
which
is
made
by
the
combination
of
three
plane
right
angles
the
figure
of
the
body
thus
composed
is
a
cube
having
six
plane
quadrangular
equilateral
bases
there
was
yet
a
fifth
combination
which
god
used
in
the
delineation
of
the
universe
now
he
who
duly
reflecting
on
all
this
enquires
whether
the
worlds
are
to
be
regarded
as
indefinite
or
definite
in
number
will
be
of
opinion
that
the
notion
of
their
indefiniteness
is
characteristic
of
a
sadly
indefinite
and
ignorant
mind
he
however
who
raises
the
question
whether
they
are
to
be
truly
regarded
as
one
or
five
takes
up
a
more
reasonable
position
arguing
from
probabilities
i
am
of
opinion
that
they
are
one
another
regarding
the
question
from
another
point
of
view
will
be
of
another
mind
but
leaving
this
enquiry
let
us
proceed
to
distribute
the
elementary
forms
which
have
now
been
created
in
idea
among
the
four
elements
to
earth
then
let
us
assign
the
cubical
form
for
earth
is
the
most
immoveable
of
the
four
and
the
most
plastic
of
all
bodies
and
that
which
has
the
most
stable
bases
must
of
necessity
be
of
such
a
nature
now
of
the
triangles
which
we
assumed
at
first
that
which
has
two
equal
sides
is
by
nature
more
firmly
based
than
that
which
has
unequal
sides
and
of
the
compound
figures
which
are
formed
out
of
either
the
plane
equilateral
quadrangle
has
necessarily
a
more
stable
basis
than
the
equilateral
triangle
both
in
the
whole
and
in
the
parts
wherefore
in
assigning
this
figure
to
earth
we
adhere
to
probability
and
to
water
we
assign
that
one
of
the
remaining
forms
which
is
the
least
moveable
and
the
most
moveable
of
them
to
fire
and
to
air
that
which
is
intermediate
also
we
assign
the
smallest
body
to
fire
and
the
greatest
to
water
and
the
intermediate
in
size
to
air
and
again
the
acutest
body
to
fire
and
the
next
in
acuteness
to
air
and
the
third
to
water
of
all
these
elements
that
which
has
the
fewest
bases
must
necessarily
be
the
most
moveable
for
it
must
be
the
acutest
and
most
penetrating
in
every
way
and
also
the
lightest
as
being
composed
of
the
smallest
number
of
similar
particles
and
the
second
body
has
similar
properties
in
a
second
degree
and
the
third
body
in
the
third
degree
let
it
be
agreed
then
both
according
to
strict
reason
and
according
to
probability
that
the
pyramid
is
the
solid
which
is
the
original
element
and
seed
of
fire
and
let
us
assign
the
element
which
was
next
in
the
order
of
generation
to
air
and
the
third
to
water
we
must
imagine
all
these
to
be
so
small
that
no
single
particle
of
any
of
the
four
kinds
is
seen
by
us
on
account
of
their
smallness
but
when
many
of
them
are
collected
together
their
aggregates
are
seen
and
the
ratios
of
their
numbers
motions
and
other
properties
everywhere
god
as
far
as
necessity
allowed
or
gave
consent
has
exactly
perfected
and
harmonized
in
due
proportion
from
all
that
we
have
just
been
saying
about
the
elements
or
kinds
the
most
probable
conclusion
is
as
follows
earth
when
meeting
with
fire
and
dissolved
by
its
sharpness
whether
the
dissolution
take
place
in
the
fire
itself
or
perhaps
in
some
mass
of
air
or
water
is
borne
hither
and
thither
until
its
parts
meeting
together
and
mutually
harmonising
again
become
earth
for
they
can
never
take
any
other
form
but
water
when
divided
by
fire
or
by
air
on
may
become
one
part
fire
and
two
parts
air
and
a
single
volume
of
air
divided
becomes
two
of
fire
again
when
a
small
body
of
fire
is
contained
in
a
larger
body
of
air
or
water
or
earth
and
both
are
moving
and
the
fire
struggling
is
overcome
and
broken
up
then
two
volumes
of
fire
form
one
volume
of
air
and
when
air
is
overcome
and
cut
up
into
small
pieces
two
and
a
half
parts
of
air
are
condensed
into
one
part
of
water
let
us
consider
the
matter
in
another
way
when
one
of
the
other
elements
is
fastened
upon
by
fire
and
is
cut
by
the
sharpness
of
its
angles
and
sides
it
coalesces
with
the
fire
and
then
ceases
to
be
cut
by
them
any
longer
for
no
element
which
is
one
and
the
same
with
itself
can
be
changed
by
or
change
another
of
the
same
kind
and
in
the
same
state
but
so
long
as
in
the
process
of
transition
the
weaker
is
fighting
against
the
stronger
the
dissolution
continues
again
when
a
few
small
particles
enclosed
in
many
larger
ones
are
in
process
of
decomposition
and
extinction
they
only
cease
from
their
tendency
to
extinction
when
they
consent
to
pass
into
the
conquering
nature
and
fire
becomes
air
and
air
water
but
if
bodies
of
another
kind
go
and
attack
them
the
small
particles
the
latter
continue
to
be
dissolved
until
being
completely
forced
back
and
dispersed
they
make
their
escape
to
their
own
kindred
or
else
being
overcome
and
assimilated
to
the
conquering
power
they
remain
where
they
are
and
dwell
with
their
victors
and
from
being
many
become
one
and
owing
to
these
affections
all
things
are
changing
their
place
for
by
the
motion
of
the
receiving
vessel
the
bulk
of
each
class
is
distributed
into
its
proper
place
but
those
things
which
become
unlike
themselves
and
like
other
things
are
hurried
by
the
shaking
into
the
place
of
the
things
to
which
they
grow
like
now
all
unmixed
and
primary
bodies
are
produced
by
such
causes
as
these
as
to
the
subordinate
species
which
are
included
in
the
greater
kinds
they
are
to
be
attributed
to
the
varieties
in
the
structure
of
the
two
original
triangles
for
either
structure
did
not
originally
produce
the
triangle
of
one
size
only
but
some
larger
and
some
smaller
and
there
are
as
many
sizes
as
there
are
species
of
the
four
elements
hence
when
they
are
mingled
with
themselves
and
with
one
another
there
is
an
endless
variety
of
them
which
those
who
would
arrive
at
the
probable
truth
of
nature
ought
duly
to
consider
unless
a
person
comes
to
an
understanding
about
the
nature
and
conditions
of
rest
and
motion
he
will
meet
with
many
difficulties
in
the
discussion
which
follows
something
has
been
said
of
this
matter
already
and
something
more
remains
to
be
said
which
is
that
motion
never
exists
in
what
is
uniform
for
to
conceive
that
anything
can
be
moved
without
a
mover
is
hard
or
indeed
impossible
and
equally
impossible
to
conceive
that
there
can
be
a
mover
unless
there
be
something
which
can
be
moved
motion
can
not
exist
where
either
of
these
are
wanting
and
for
these
to
be
uniform
is
impossible
wherefore
we
must
assign
rest
to
uniformity
and
motion
to
the
want
of
uniformity
now
inequality
is
the
cause
of
the
nature
which
is
wanting
in
uniformity
and
of
this
we
have
already
described
the
origin
but
there
still
remains
the
further
point
why
things
when
divided
after
their
kinds
do
not
cease
to
pass
through
one
another
and
to
change
their
place
which
we
will
now
proceed
to
explain
in
the
revolution
of
the
universe
are
comprehended
all
the
four
elements
and
this
being
circular
and
having
a
tendency
to
come
together
compresses
everything
and
will
not
allow
any
place
to
be
left
void
wherefore
also
fire
above
all
things
penetrates
everywhere
and
air
next
as
being
next
in
rarity
of
the
elements
and
the
two
other
elements
in
like
manner
penetrate
according
to
their
degrees
of
rarity
for
those
things
which
are
composed
of
the
largest
particles
have
the
largest
void
left
in
their
compositions
and
those
which
are
composed
of
the
smallest
particles
have
the
least
and
the
contraction
caused
by
the
compression
thrusts
the
smaller
particles
into
the
interstices
of
the
larger
and
thus
when
the
small
parts
are
placed
side
by
side
with
the
larger
and
the
lesser
divide
the
greater
and
the
greater
unite
the
lesser
all
the
elements
are
borne
up
and
down
and
hither
and
thither
towards
their
own
places
for
the
change
in
the
size
of
each
changes
its
position
in
space
and
these
causes
generate
an
inequality
which
is
always
maintained
and
is
continually
creating
a
perpetual
motion
of
the
elements
in
all
time
in
the
next
place
we
have
to
consider
that
there
are
divers
kinds
of
fire
there
are
for
example
first
flame
and
secondly
those
emanations
of
flame
which
do
not
burn
but
only
give
light
to
the
eyes
thirdly
the
remains
of
fire
which
are
seen
in
embers
after
the
flame
has
been
extinguished
there
are
similar
differences
in
the
air
of
which
the
brightest
part
is
called
the
aether
and
the
most
turbid
sort
mist
and
darkness
and
there
are
various
other
nameless
kinds
which
arise
from
the
inequality
of
the
triangles
water
again
admits
in
the
first
place
of
a
division
into
two
kinds
the
one
liquid
and
the
other
fusile
the
liquid
kind
is
composed
of
the
small
and
unequal
particles
of
water
and
moves
itself
and
is
moved
by
other
bodies
owing
to
the
want
of
uniformity
and
the
shape
of
its
particles
whereas
the
fusile
kind
being
formed
of
large
and
uniform
particles
is
more
stable
than
the
other
and
is
heavy
and
compact
by
reason
of
its
uniformity
but
when
fire
gets
in
and
dissolves
the
particles
and
destroys
the
uniformity
it
has
greater
mobility
and
becoming
fluid
is
thrust
forth
by
the
neighbouring
air
and
spreads
upon
the
earth
and
this
dissolution
of
the
solid
masses
is
called
melting
and
their
spreading
out
upon
the
earth
flowing
again
when
the
fire
goes
out
of
the
fusile
substance
it
does
not
pass
into
a
vacuum
but
into
the
neighbouring
air
and
the
air
which
is
displaced
forces
together
the
liquid
and
still
moveable
mass
into
the
place
which
was
occupied
by
the
fire
and
unites
it
with
itself
thus
compressed
the
mass
resumes
its
equability
and
is
again
at
unity
with
itself
because
the
fire
which
was
the
author
of
the
inequality
has
retreated
and
this
departure
of
the
fire
is
called
cooling
and
the
coming
together
which
follows
upon
it
is
termed
congealment
of
all
the
kinds
termed
fusile
that
which
is
the
densest
and
is
formed
out
of
the
finest
and
most
uniform
parts
is
that
most
precious
possession
called
gold
which
is
hardened
by
filtration
through
rock
this
is
unique
in
kind
and
has
both
a
glittering
and
a
yellow
colour
a
shoot
of
gold
which
is
so
dense
as
to
be
very
hard
and
takes
a
black
colour
is
termed
adamant
there
is
also
another
kind
which
has
parts
nearly
like
gold
and
of
which
there
are
several
species
it
is
denser
than
gold
and
it
contains
a
small
and
fine
portion
of
earth
and
is
therefore
harder
yet
also
lighter
because
of
the
great
interstices
which
it
has
within
itself
and
this
substance
which
is
one
of
the
bright
and
denser
kinds
of
water
when
solidified
is
called
copper
there
is
an
alloy
of
earth
mingled
with
it
which
when
the
two
parts
grow
old
and
are
disunited
shows
itself
separately
and
is
called
rust
the
remaining
phenomena
of
the
same
kind
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
reasoning
out
by
the
method
of
probabilities
a
man
may
sometimes
set
aside
meditations
about
eternal
things
and
for
recreation
turn
to
consider
the
truths
of
generation
which
are
probable
only
he
will
thus
gain
a
pleasure
not
to
be
repented
of
and
secure
for
himself
while
he
lives
a
wise
and
moderate
pastime
let
us
grant
ourselves
this
indulgence
and
go
through
the
probabilities
relating
to
the
same
subjects
which
follow
next
in
order
water
which
is
mingled
with
fire
so
much
as
is
fine
and
liquid
being
so
called
by
reason
of
its
motion
and
the
way
in
which
it
rolls
along
the
ground
and
soft
because
its
bases
give
way
and
are
less
stable
than
those
of
earth
when
separated
from
fire
and
air
and
isolated
becomes
more
uniform
and
by
their
retirement
is
compressed
into
itself
and
if
the
condensation
be
very
great
the
water
above
the
earth
becomes
hail
but
on
the
earth
ice
and
that
which
is
congealed
in
a
less
degree
and
is
only
half
solid
when
above
the
earth
is
called
snow
and
when
upon
the
earth
and
condensed
from
dew
then
again
there
are
the
numerous
kinds
of
water
which
have
been
mingled
with
one
another
and
are
distilled
through
plants
which
grow
in
the
earth
and
this
whole
class
is
called
by
the
name
of
juices
or
saps
the
unequal
admixture
of
these
fluids
creates
a
variety
of
species
most
of
them
are
nameless
but
four
which
are
of
a
fiery
nature
are
clearly
distinguished
and
have
names
first
there
is
wine
which
warms
the
soul
as
well
as
the
body
secondly
there
is
the
oily
nature
which
is
smooth
and
divides
the
visual
ray
and
for
this
reason
is
bright
and
shining
and
of
a
glistening
appearance
including
pitch
the
juice
of
the
castor
berry
oil
itself
and
other
things
of
a
like
kind
thirdly
there
is
the
class
of
substances
which
expand
the
contracted
parts
of
the
mouth
until
they
return
to
their
natural
state
and
by
reason
of
this
property
create
sweetness
these
are
included
under
the
general
name
of
honey
and
lastly
there
is
a
frothy
nature
which
differs
from
all
juices
having
a
burning
quality
which
dissolves
the
flesh
it
is
called
opos
a
vegetable
acid
as
to
the
kinds
of
earth
that
which
is
filtered
through
water
passes
into
stone
in
the
following
manner
the
water
which
mixes
with
the
earth
and
is
broken
up
in
the
process
changes
into
air
and
taking
this
form
mounts
into
its
own
place
but
as
there
is
no
surrounding
vacuum
it
thrusts
away
the
neighbouring
air
and
this
being
rendered
heavy
and
when
it
is
displaced
having
been
poured
around
the
mass
of
earth
forcibly
compresses
it
and
drives
it
into
the
vacant
space
whence
the
new
air
had
come
up
and
the
earth
when
compressed
by
the
air
into
an
indissoluble
union
with
water
becomes
rock
the
fairer
sort
is
that
which
is
made
up
of
equal
and
similar
parts
and
is
transparent
that
which
has
the
opposite
qualities
is
inferior
but
when
all
the
watery
part
is
suddenly
drawn
out
by
fire
a
more
brittle
substance
is
formed
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
pottery
sometimes
also
moisture
may
remain
and
the
earth
which
has
been
fused
by
fire
becomes
when
cool
a
certain
stone
of
a
black
colour
a
like
separation
of
the
water
which
had
been
copiously
mingled
with
them
may
occur
in
two
substances
composed
of
finer
particles
of
earth
and
of
a
briny
nature
out
of
either
of
them
a
is
then
formed
soluble
in
water
the
one
soda
which
is
used
for
purging
away
oil
and
earth
the
other
salt
which
harmonizes
so
well
in
combinations
pleasing
to
the
palate
and
is
as
the
law
testifies
a
substance
dear
to
the
gods
the
compounds
of
earth
and
water
are
not
soluble
by
water
but
by
fire
only
and
for
this
reason
neither
fire
nor
air
melt
masses
of
earth
for
their
particles
being
smaller
than
the
interstices
in
its
structure
have
plenty
of
room
to
move
without
forcing
their
way
and
so
they
leave
the
earth
unmelted
and
undissolved
but
particles
of
water
which
are
larger
force
a
passage
and
dissolve
and
melt
the
earth
wherefore
earth
when
not
consolidated
by
force
is
dissolved
by
water
only
when
consolidated
by
nothing
but
fire
for
this
is
the
only
body
which
can
find
an
entrance
the
cohesion
of
water
again
when
very
strong
is
dissolved
by
fire
only
when
weaker
then
either
by
air
or
fire
the
former
entering
the
interstices
and
the
latter
penetrating
even
the
triangles
but
nothing
can
dissolve
air
when
strongly
condensed
which
does
not
reach
the
elements
or
triangles
or
if
not
strongly
condensed
then
only
fire
can
dissolve
it
as
to
bodies
composed
of
earth
and
water
while
the
water
occupies
the
vacant
interstices
of
the
earth
in
them
which
are
compressed
by
force
the
particles
of
water
which
approach
them
from
without
finding
no
entrance
flow
around
the
entire
mass
and
leave
it
undissolved
but
the
particles
of
fire
entering
into
the
interstices
of
the
water
do
to
the
water
what
water
does
to
earth
and
fire
to
air
the
text
seems
to
be
corrupt
and
are
the
sole
causes
of
the
compound
body
of
earth
and
water
liquefying
and
becoming
fluid
now
these
bodies
are
of
two
kinds
some
of
them
such
as
glass
and
the
fusible
sort
of
stones
have
less
water
than
they
have
earth
on
the
other
hand
substances
of
the
nature
of
wax
and
incense
have
more
of
water
entering
into
their
composition
i
have
thus
shown
the
various
classes
of
bodies
as
they
are
diversified
by
their
forms
and
combinations
and
changes
into
one
another
and
now
i
must
endeavour
to
set
forth
their
affections
and
the
causes
of
them
in
the
first
place
the
bodies
which
i
have
been
describing
are
necessarily
objects
of
sense
but
we
have
not
yet
considered
the
origin
of
flesh
or
what
belongs
to
flesh
or
of
that
part
of
the
soul
which
is
mortal
and
these
things
can
not
be
adequately
explained
without
also
explaining
the
affections
which
are
concerned
with
sensation
nor
the
latter
without
the
former
and
yet
to
explain
them
together
is
hardly
possible
for
which
reason
we
must
assume
first
one
or
the
other
and
afterwards
examine
the
nature
of
our
hypothesis
in
order
then
that
the
affections
may
follow
regularly
after
the
elements
let
us
presuppose
the
existence
of
body
and
soul
first
let
us
enquire
what
we
mean
by
saying
that
fire
is
hot
and
about
this
we
may
reason
from
the
dividing
or
cutting
power
which
it
exercises
on
our
bodies
we
all
of
us
feel
that
fire
is
sharp
and
we
may
further
consider
the
fineness
of
the
sides
and
the
sharpness
of
the
angles
and
the
smallness
of
the
particles
and
the
swiftness
of
the
motion
all
this
makes
the
action
of
fire
violent
and
sharp
so
that
it
cuts
whatever
it
meets
and
we
must
not
forget
that
the
original
figure
of
fire
the
pyramid
more
than
any
other
form
has
a
dividing
power
which
cuts
our
bodies
into
small
pieces
kepmatizei
and
thus
naturally
produces
that
affection
which
we
call
heat
and
hence
the
origin
of
the
name
thepmos
kepma
now
the
opposite
of
this
is
sufficiently
manifest
nevertheless
we
will
not
fail
to
describe
it
for
the
larger
particles
of
moisture
which
surround
the
body
entering
in
and
driving
out
the
lesser
but
not
being
able
to
take
their
places
compress
the
moist
principle
in
us
and
this
from
being
unequal
and
disturbed
is
forced
by
them
into
a
state
of
rest
which
is
due
to
equability
and
compression
but
things
which
are
contracted
contrary
to
nature
are
by
nature
at
war
and
force
themselves
apart
and
to
this
war
and
convulsion
the
name
of
shivering
and
trembling
is
given
and
the
whole
affection
and
the
cause
of
the
affection
are
both
termed
cold
that
is
called
hard
to
which
our
flesh
yields
and
soft
which
yields
to
our
flesh
and
things
are
also
termed
hard
and
soft
relatively
to
one
another
that
which
yields
has
a
small
base
but
that
which
rests
on
quadrangular
bases
is
firmly
posed
and
belongs
to
the
class
which
offers
the
greatest
resistance
so
too
does
that
which
is
the
most
compact
and
therefore
most
repellent
the
nature
of
the
light
and
the
heavy
will
be
best
understood
when
examined
in
connexion
with
our
notions
of
above
and
below
for
it
is
quite
a
mistake
to
suppose
that
the
universe
is
parted
into
two
regions
separate
from
and
opposite
to
each
other
the
one
a
lower
to
which
all
things
tend
which
have
any
bulk
and
an
upper
to
which
things
only
ascend
against
their
will
for
as
the
universe
is
in
the
form
of
a
sphere
all
the
extremities
being
equidistant
from
the
centre
are
equally
extremities
and
the
centre
which
is
equidistant
from
them
is
equally
to
be
regarded
as
the
opposite
of
them
all
such
being
the
nature
of
the
world
when
a
person
says
that
any
of
these
points
is
above
or
below
may
he
not
be
justly
charged
with
using
an
improper
expression
for
the
centre
of
the
world
can
not
be
rightly
called
either
above
or
below
but
is
the
centre
and
nothing
else
and
the
circumference
is
not
the
centre
and
has
in
no
one
part
of
itself
a
different
relation
to
the
centre
from
what
it
has
in
any
of
the
opposite
parts
indeed
when
it
is
in
every
direction
similar
how
can
one
rightly
give
to
it
names
which
imply
opposition
for
if
there
were
any
solid
body
in
equipoise
at
the
centre
of
the
universe
there
would
be
nothing
to
draw
it
to
this
extreme
rather
than
to
that
for
they
are
all
perfectly
similar
and
if
a
person
were
to
go
round
the
world
in
a
circle
he
would
often
when
standing
at
the
antipodes
of
his
former
position
speak
of
the
same
point
as
above
and
below
for
as
i
was
saying
just
now
to
speak
of
the
whole
which
is
in
the
form
of
a
globe
as
having
one
part
above
and
another
below
is
not
like
a
sensible
man
the
reason
why
these
names
are
used
and
the
circumstances
under
which
they
are
ordinarily
applied
by
us
to
the
division
of
the
heavens
may
be
elucidated
by
the
following
supposition
if
a
person
were
to
stand
in
that
part
of
the
universe
which
is
the
appointed
place
of
fire
and
where
there
is
the
great
mass
of
fire
to
which
fiery
bodies
gather
if
i
say
he
were
to
ascend
thither
and
having
the
power
to
do
this
were
to
abstract
particles
of
fire
and
put
them
in
scales
and
weigh
them
and
then
raising
the
balance
were
to
draw
the
fire
by
force
towards
the
uncongenial
element
of
the
air
it
would
be
very
evident
that
he
could
compel
the
smaller
mass
more
readily
than
the
larger
for
when
two
things
are
simultaneously
raised
by
one
and
the
same
power
the
smaller
body
must
necessarily
yield
to
the
superior
power
with
less
reluctance
than
the
larger
and
the
larger
body
is
called
heavy
and
said
to
tend
downwards
and
the
smaller
body
is
called
light
and
said
to
tend
upwards
and
we
may
detect
ourselves
who
are
upon
the
earth
doing
precisely
the
same
thing
for
we
often
separate
earthy
natures
and
sometimes
earth
itself
and
draw
them
into
the
uncongenial
element
of
air
by
force
and
contrary
to
nature
both
clinging
to
their
kindred
elements
but
that
which
is
smaller
yields
to
the
impulse
given
by
us
towards
the
dissimilar
element
more
easily
than
the
larger
and
so
we
call
the
former
light
and
the
place
towards
which
it
is
impelled
we
call
above
and
the
contrary
state
and
place
we
call
heavy
and
below
respectively
now
the
relations
of
these
must
necessarily
vary
because
the
principal
masses
of
the
different
elements
hold
opposite
positions
for
that
which
is
light
heavy
below
or
above
in
one
place
will
be
found
to
be
and
become
contrary
and
transverse
and
every
way
diverse
in
relation
to
that
which
is
light
heavy
below
or
above
in
an
opposite
place
and
about
all
of
them
this
has
to
be
considered
that
the
tendency
of
each
towards
its
kindred
element
makes
the
body
which
is
moved
heavy
and
the
place
towards
which
the
motion
tends
below
but
things
which
have
an
opposite
tendency
we
call
by
an
opposite
name
such
are
the
causes
which
we
assign
to
these
phenomena
as
to
the
smooth
and
the
rough
any
one
who
sees
them
can
explain
the
reason
of
them
to
another
for
roughness
is
hardness
mingled
with
irregularity
and
smoothness
is
produced
by
the
joint
effect
of
uniformity
and
density
the
most
important
of
the
affections
which
concern
the
whole
body
remains
to
be
considered
that
is
the
cause
of
pleasure
and
pain
in
the
perceptions
of
which
i
have
been
speaking
and
in
all
other
things
which
are
perceived
by
sense
through
the
parts
of
the
body
and
have
both
pains
and
pleasures
attendant
on
them
let
us
imagine
the
causes
of
every
affection
whether
of
sense
or
not
to
be
of
the
following
nature
remembering
that
we
have
already
distinguished
between
the
nature
which
is
easy
and
which
is
hard
to
move
for
this
is
the
direction
in
which
we
must
hunt
the
prey
which
we
mean
to
take
a
body
which
is
of
a
nature
to
be
easily
moved
on
receiving
an
impression
however
slight
spreads
abroad
the
motion
in
a
circle
the
parts
communicating
with
each
other
until
at
last
reaching
the
principle
of
mind
they
announce
the
quality
of
the
agent
but
a
body
of
the
opposite
kind
being
immobile
and
not
extending
to
the
surrounding
region
merely
receives
the
impression
and
does
not
stir
any
of
the
neighbouring
parts
and
since
the
parts
do
not
distribute
the
original
impression
to
other
parts
it
has
no
effect
of
motion
on
the
whole
animal
and
therefore
produces
no
effect
on
the
patient
this
is
true
of
the
bones
and
hair
and
other
more
earthy
parts
of
the
human
body
whereas
what
was
said
above
relates
mainly
to
sight
and
hearing
because
they
have
in
them
the
greatest
amount
of
fire
and
air
now
we
must
conceive
of
pleasure
and
pain
in
this
way
an
impression
produced
in
us
contrary
to
nature
and
violent
if
sudden
is
painful
and
again
the
sudden
return
to
nature
is
pleasant
but
a
gentle
and
gradual
return
is
imperceptible
and
vice
versa
on
the
other
hand
the
impression
of
sense
which
is
most
easily
produced
is
most
readily
felt
but
is
not
accompanied
by
pleasure
or
pain
such
for
example
are
the
affections
of
the
sight
which
as
we
said
above
is
a
body
naturally
uniting
with
our
body
in
the
for
cuttings
and
burnings
and
other
affections
which
happen
to
the
sight
do
not
give
pain
nor
is
there
pleasure
when
the
sight
returns
to
its
natural
state
but
the
sensations
are
clearest
and
strongest
according
to
the
manner
in
which
the
eye
is
affected
by
the
object
and
itself
strikes
and
touches
it
there
is
no
violence
either
in
the
contraction
or
dilation
of
the
eye
but
bodies
formed
of
larger
particles
yield
to
the
agent
only
with
a
struggle
and
then
they
impart
their
motions
to
the
whole
and
cause
pleasure
and
pain
pain
when
alienated
from
their
natural
conditions
and
pleasure
when
restored
to
them
things
which
experience
gradual
withdrawings
and
emptyings
of
their
nature
and
great
and
sudden
replenishments
fail
to
perceive
the
emptying
but
are
sensible
of
the
replenishment
and
so
they
occasion
no
pain
but
the
greatest
pleasure
to
the
mortal
part
of
the
soul
as
is
manifest
in
the
case
of
perfumes
but
things
which
are
changed
all
of
a
sudden
and
only
gradually
and
with
difficulty
return
to
their
own
nature
have
effects
in
every
way
opposite
to
the
former
as
is
evident
in
the
case
of
burnings
and
cuttings
of
the
body
thus
have
we
discussed
the
general
affections
of
the
whole
body
and
the
names
of
the
agents
which
produce
them
and
now
i
will
endeavour
to
speak
of
the
affections
of
particular
parts
and
the
causes
and
agents
of
them
as
far
as
i
am
able
in
the
first
place
let
us
set
forth
what
was
omitted
when
we
were
speaking
of
juices
concerning
the
affections
peculiar
to
the
tongue
these
too
like
most
of
the
other
affections
appear
to
be
caused
by
certain
contractions
and
dilations
but
they
have
besides
more
of
roughness
and
smoothness
than
is
found
in
other
affections
for
whenever
earthy
particles
enter
into
the
small
veins
which
are
the
testing
instruments
of
the
tongue
reaching
to
the
heart
and
fall
upon
the
moist
delicate
portions
of
flesh
when
as
they
are
dissolved
they
contract
and
dry
up
the
little
veins
they
are
astringent
if
they
are
rougher
but
if
not
so
rough
then
only
harsh
those
of
them
which
are
of
an
abstergent
nature
and
purge
the
whole
surface
of
the
tongue
if
they
do
it
in
excess
and
so
encroach
as
to
consume
some
part
of
the
flesh
itself
like
potash
and
soda
are
all
termed
bitter
but
the
particles
which
are
deficient
in
the
alkaline
quality
and
which
cleanse
only
moderately
are
called
salt
and
having
no
bitterness
or
roughness
are
regarded
as
rather
agreeable
than
otherwise
bodies
which
share
in
and
are
made
smooth
by
the
heat
of
the
mouth
and
which
are
inflamed
and
again
in
turn
inflame
that
which
heats
them
and
which
are
so
light
that
they
are
carried
upwards
to
the
sensations
of
the
head
and
cut
all
that
comes
in
their
way
by
reason
of
these
qualities
in
them
are
all
termed
pungent
but
when
these
same
particles
refined
by
putrefaction
enter
into
the
narrow
veins
and
are
duly
proportioned
to
the
particles
of
earth
and
air
which
are
there
they
set
them
whirling
about
one
another
and
while
they
are
in
a
whirl
cause
them
to
dash
against
and
enter
into
one
another
and
so
form
hollows
surrounding
the
particles
that
enter
which
watery
vessels
of
air
for
a
film
of
moisture
sometimes
earthy
sometimes
pure
is
spread
around
the
air
are
hollow
spheres
of
water
and
those
of
them
which
are
pure
are
transparent
and
are
called
bubbles
while
those
composed
of
the
earthy
liquid
which
is
in
a
state
of
general
agitation
and
effervescence
are
said
to
boil
or
ferment
of
all
these
affections
the
cause
is
termed
acid
and
there
is
the
opposite
affection
arising
from
an
opposite
cause
when
the
mass
of
entering
particles
immersed
in
the
moisture
of
the
mouth
is
congenial
to
the
tongue
and
smooths
and
oils
over
the
roughness
and
relaxes
the
parts
which
are
unnaturally
contracted
and
contracts
the
parts
which
are
relaxed
and
disposes
them
all
according
to
their
nature
that
sort
of
remedy
of
violent
affections
is
pleasant
and
agreeable
to
every
man
and
has
the
name
sweet
but
enough
of
this
the
faculty
of
smell
does
not
admit
of
differences
of
kind
for
all
smells
are
of
a
nature
and
no
element
is
so
proportioned
as
to
have
any
smell
the
veins
about
the
nose
are
too
narrow
to
admit
earth
and
water
and
too
wide
to
detain
fire
and
air
and
for
this
reason
no
one
ever
perceives
the
smell
of
any
of
them
but
smells
always
proceed
from
bodies
that
are
damp
or
putrefying
or
liquefying
or
evaporating
and
are
perceptible
only
in
the
intermediate
state
when
water
is
changing
into
air
and
air
into
water
and
all
of
them
are
either
vapour
or
mist
that
which
is
passing
out
of
air
into
water
is
mist
and
that
which
is
passing
from
water
into
air
is
vapour
and
hence
all
smells
are
thinner
than
water
and
thicker
than
air
the
proof
of
this
is
that
when
there
is
any
obstruction
to
the
respiration
and
a
man
draws
in
his
breath
by
force
then
no
smell
filters
through
but
the
air
without
the
smell
alone
penetrates
wherefore
the
varieties
of
smell
have
no
name
and
they
have
not
many
or
definite
and
simple
kinds
but
they
are
distinguished
only
as
painful
and
pleasant
the
one
sort
irritating
and
disturbing
the
whole
cavity
which
is
situated
between
the
head
and
the
navel
the
other
having
a
soothing
influence
and
restoring
this
same
region
to
an
agreeable
and
natural
condition
in
considering
the
third
kind
of
sense
hearing
we
must
speak
of
the
causes
in
which
it
originates
we
may
in
general
assume
sound
to
be
a
blow
which
passes
through
the
ears
and
is
transmitted
by
means
of
the
air
the
brain
and
the
blood
to
the
soul
and
that
hearing
is
the
vibration
of
this
blow
which
begins
in
the
head
and
ends
in
the
region
of
the
liver
the
sound
which
moves
swiftly
is
acute
and
the
sound
which
moves
slowly
is
grave
and
that
which
is
regular
is
equable
and
smooth
and
the
reverse
is
harsh
a
great
body
of
sound
is
loud
and
a
small
body
of
sound
the
reverse
respecting
the
harmonies
of
sound
i
must
hereafter
speak
there
is
a
fourth
class
of
sensible
things
having
many
intricate
varieties
which
must
now
be
distinguished
they
are
called
by
the
general
name
of
colours
and
are
a
flame
which
emanates
from
every
sort
of
body
and
has
particles
corresponding
to
the
sense
of
sight
i
have
spoken
already
in
what
has
preceded
of
the
causes
which
generate
sight
and
in
this
place
it
will
be
natural
and
suitable
to
give
a
rational
theory
of
colours
of
the
particles
coming
from
other
bodies
which
fall
upon
the
sight
some
are
smaller
and
some
are
larger
and
some
are
equal
to
the
parts
of
the
sight
itself
those
which
are
equal
are
imperceptible
and
we
call
them
transparent
the
larger
produce
contraction
the
smaller
dilation
in
the
sight
exercising
a
power
akin
to
that
of
hot
and
cold
bodies
on
the
flesh
or
of
astringent
bodies
on
the
tongue
or
of
those
heating
bodies
which
we
termed
pungent
white
and
black
are
similar
effects
of
contraction
and
dilation
in
another
sphere
and
for
this
reason
have
a
different
appearance
wherefore
we
ought
to
term
white
that
which
dilates
the
visual
ray
and
the
opposite
of
this
is
black
there
is
also
a
swifter
motion
of
a
different
sort
of
fire
which
strikes
and
dilates
the
ray
of
sight
until
it
reaches
the
eyes
forcing
a
way
through
their
passages
and
melting
them
and
eliciting
from
them
a
union
of
fire
and
water
which
we
call
tears
being
itself
an
opposite
fire
which
comes
to
them
from
an
opposite
direction
the
inner
fire
flashes
forth
like
lightning
and
the
outer
finds
a
way
in
and
is
extinguished
in
the
moisture
and
all
sorts
of
colours
are
generated
by
the
mixture
this
affection
is
termed
dazzling
and
the
object
which
produces
it
is
called
bright
and
flashing
there
is
another
sort
of
fire
which
is
intermediate
and
which
reaches
and
mingles
with
the
moisture
of
the
eye
without
flashing
and
in
this
the
fire
mingling
with
the
ray
of
the
moisture
produces
a
colour
like
blood
to
which
we
give
the
name
of
red
a
bright
hue
mingled
with
red
and
white
gives
the
colour
called
auburn
greek
the
law
of
proportion
however
according
to
which
the
several
colours
are
formed
even
if
a
man
knew
he
would
be
foolish
in
telling
for
he
could
not
give
any
necessary
reason
nor
indeed
any
tolerable
or
probable
explanation
of
them
again
red
when
mingled
with
black
and
white
becomes
purple
but
it
becomes
umber
greek
when
the
colours
are
burnt
as
well
as
mingled
and
the
black
is
more
thoroughly
mixed
with
them
greek
is
produced
by
a
union
of
auburn
and
dun
greek
and
dun
by
an
admixture
of
black
and
white
pale
yellow
greek
by
an
admixture
of
white
and
auburn
white
and
bright
meeting
and
falling
upon
a
full
black
become
dark
blue
greek
and
when
dark
blue
mingles
with
white
a
light
blue
greek
colour
is
formed
as
with
black
makes
leek
green
greek
there
will
be
no
difficulty
in
seeing
how
and
by
what
mixtures
the
colours
derived
from
these
are
made
according
to
the
rules
of
probability
he
however
who
should
attempt
to
verify
all
this
by
experiment
would
forget
the
difference
of
the
human
and
divine
nature
for
god
only
has
the
knowledge
and
also
the
power
which
are
able
to
combine
many
things
into
one
and
again
resolve
the
one
into
many
but
no
man
either
is
or
ever
will
be
able
to
accomplish
either
the
one
or
the
other
operation
these
are
the
elements
thus
of
necessity
then
subsisting
which
the
creator
of
the
fairest
and
best
of
created
things
associated
with
himself
when
he
made
the
and
most
perfect
god
using
the
necessary
causes
as
his
ministers
in
the
accomplishment
of
his
work
but
himself
contriving
the
good
in
all
his
creations
wherefore
we
may
distinguish
two
sorts
of
causes
the
one
divine
and
the
other
necessary
and
may
seek
for
the
divine
in
all
things
as
far
as
our
nature
admits
with
a
view
to
the
blessed
life
but
the
necessary
kind
only
for
the
sake
of
the
divine
considering
that
without
them
and
when
isolated
from
them
these
higher
things
for
which
we
look
can
not
be
apprehended
or
received
or
in
any
way
shared
by
us
seeing
then
that
we
have
now
prepared
for
our
use
the
various
classes
of
causes
which
are
the
material
out
of
which
the
remainder
of
our
discourse
must
be
woven
just
as
wood
is
the
material
of
the
carpenter
let
us
revert
in
a
few
words
to
the
point
at
which
we
began
and
then
endeavour
to
add
on
a
suitable
ending
to
the
beginning
of
our
tale
as
i
said
at
first
when
all
things
were
in
disorder
god
created
in
each
thing
in
relation
to
itself
and
in
all
things
in
relation
to
each
other
all
the
measures
and
harmonies
which
they
could
possibly
receive
for
in
those
days
nothing
had
any
proportion
except
by
accident
nor
did
any
of
the
things
which
now
have
names
deserve
to
be
named
at
all
as
for
example
fire
water
and
the
rest
of
the
elements
all
these
the
creator
first
set
in
order
and
out
of
them
he
constructed
the
universe
which
was
a
single
animal
comprehending
in
itself
all
other
animals
mortal
and
immortal
now
of
the
divine
he
himself
was
the
creator
but
the
creation
of
the
mortal
he
committed
to
his
offspring
and
they
imitating
him
received
from
him
the
immortal
principle
of
the
soul
and
around
this
they
proceeded
to
fashion
a
mortal
body
and
made
it
to
be
the
vehicle
of
the
soul
and
constructed
within
the
body
a
soul
of
another
nature
which
was
mortal
subject
to
terrible
and
irresistible
affections
first
of
all
pleasure
the
greatest
incitement
to
evil
then
pain
which
deters
from
good
also
rashness
and
fear
two
foolish
counsellors
anger
hard
to
be
appeased
and
hope
easily
led
astray
these
they
mingled
with
irrational
sense
and
with
love
according
to
necessary
laws
and
so
framed
man
wherefore
fearing
to
pollute
the
divine
any
more
than
was
absolutely
unavoidable
they
gave
to
the
mortal
nature
a
separate
habitation
in
another
part
of
the
body
placing
the
neck
between
them
to
be
the
isthmus
and
boundary
which
they
constructed
between
the
head
and
breast
to
keep
them
apart
and
in
the
breast
and
in
what
is
termed
the
thorax
they
encased
the
mortal
soul
and
as
the
one
part
of
this
was
superior
and
the
other
inferior
they
divided
the
cavity
of
the
thorax
into
two
parts
as
the
women
and
men
apartments
are
divided
in
houses
and
placed
the
midriff
to
be
a
wall
of
partition
between
them
that
part
of
the
inferior
soul
which
is
endowed
with
courage
and
passion
and
loves
contention
they
settled
nearer
the
head
midway
between
the
midriff
and
the
neck
in
order
that
it
might
be
under
the
rule
of
reason
and
might
join
with
it
in
controlling
and
restraining
the
desires
when
they
are
no
longer
willing
of
their
own
accord
to
obey
the
word
of
command
issuing
from
the
citadel
the
heart
the
knot
of
the
veins
and
the
fountain
of
the
blood
which
races
through
all
the
limbs
was
set
in
the
place
of
guard
that
when
the
might
of
passion
was
roused
by
reason
making
proclamation
of
any
wrong
assailing
them
from
without
or
being
perpetrated
by
the
desires
within
quickly
the
whole
power
of
feeling
in
the
body
perceiving
these
commands
and
threats
might
obey
and
follow
through
every
turn
and
alley
and
thus
allow
the
principle
of
the
best
to
have
the
command
in
all
of
them
but
the
gods
foreknowing
that
the
palpitation
of
the
heart
in
the
expectation
of
danger
and
the
swelling
and
excitement
of
passion
was
caused
by
fire
formed
and
implanted
as
a
supporter
to
the
heart
the
lung
which
was
in
the
first
place
soft
and
bloodless
and
also
had
within
hollows
like
the
pores
of
a
sponge
in
order
that
by
receiving
the
breath
and
the
drink
it
might
give
coolness
and
the
power
of
respiration
and
alleviate
the
heat
wherefore
they
cut
the
leading
to
the
lung
and
placed
the
lung
about
the
heart
as
a
soft
spring
that
when
passion
was
rife
within
the
heart
beating
against
a
yielding
body
might
be
cooled
and
suffer
less
and
might
thus
become
more
ready
to
join
with
passion
in
the
service
of
reason
the
part
of
the
soul
which
desires
meats
and
drinks
and
the
other
things
of
which
it
has
need
by
reason
of
the
bodily
nature
they
placed
between
the
midriff
and
the
boundary
of
the
navel
contriving
in
all
this
region
a
sort
of
manger
for
the
food
of
the
body
and
there
they
bound
it
down
like
a
wild
animal
which
was
chained
up
with
man
and
must
be
nourished
if
man
was
to
exist
they
appointed
this
lower
creation
his
place
here
in
order
that
he
might
be
always
feeding
at
the
manger
and
have
his
dwelling
as
far
as
might
be
from
the
making
as
little
noise
and
disturbance
as
possible
and
permitting
the
best
part
to
advise
quietly
for
the
good
of
the
whole
and
knowing
that
this
lower
principle
in
man
would
not
comprehend
reason
and
even
if
attaining
to
some
degree
of
perception
would
never
naturally
care
for
rational
notions
but
that
it
would
be
led
away
by
phantoms
and
visions
night
and
day
to
be
a
remedy
for
this
god
combined
with
it
the
liver
and
placed
it
in
the
house
of
the
lower
nature
contriving
that
it
should
be
solid
and
smooth
and
bright
and
sweet
and
should
also
have
a
bitter
quality
in
order
that
the
power
of
thought
which
proceeds
from
the
mind
might
be
reflected
as
in
a
mirror
which
receives
likenesses
of
objects
and
gives
back
images
of
them
to
the
sight
and
so
might
strike
terror
into
the
desires
when
making
use
of
the
bitter
part
of
the
liver
to
which
it
is
akin
it
comes
threatening
and
invading
and
diffusing
this
bitter
element
swiftly
through
the
whole
liver
produces
colours
like
bile
and
contracting
every
part
makes
it
wrinkled
and
rough
and
twisting
out
of
its
right
place
and
contorting
the
lobe
and
closing
and
shutting
up
the
vessels
and
gates
causes
pain
and
loathing
and
the
converse
happens
when
some
gentle
inspiration
of
the
understanding
pictures
images
of
an
opposite
character
and
allays
the
bile
and
bitterness
by
refusing
to
stir
or
touch
the
nature
opposed
to
itself
but
by
making
use
of
the
natural
sweetness
of
the
liver
corrects
all
things
and
makes
them
to
be
right
and
smooth
and
free
and
renders
the
portion
of
the
soul
which
resides
about
the
liver
happy
and
joyful
enabling
it
to
pass
the
night
in
peace
and
to
practise
divination
in
sleep
inasmuch
as
it
has
no
share
in
mind
and
reason
for
the
authors
of
our
being
remembering
the
command
of
their
father
when
he
bade
them
create
the
human
race
as
good
as
they
could
that
they
might
correct
our
inferior
parts
and
make
them
to
attain
a
measure
of
truth
placed
in
the
liver
the
seat
of
divination
and
herein
is
a
proof
that
god
has
given
the
art
of
divination
not
to
the
wisdom
but
to
the
foolishness
of
man
no
man
when
in
his
wits
attains
prophetic
truth
and
inspiration
but
when
he
receives
the
inspired
word
either
his
intelligence
is
enthralled
in
sleep
or
he
is
demented
by
some
distemper
or
possession
and
he
who
would
understand
what
he
remembers
to
have
been
said
whether
in
a
dream
or
when
he
was
awake
by
the
prophetic
and
inspired
nature
or
would
determine
by
reason
the
meaning
of
the
apparitions
which
he
has
seen
and
what
indications
they
afford
to
this
man
or
that
of
past
present
or
future
good
and
evil
must
first
recover
his
wits
but
while
he
continues
demented
he
can
not
judge
of
the
visions
which
he
sees
or
the
words
which
he
utters
the
ancient
saying
is
very
true
that
a
man
who
has
his
wits
can
act
or
judge
about
himself
and
his
own
affairs
and
for
this
reason
it
is
customary
to
appoint
interpreters
to
be
judges
of
the
true
inspiration
some
persons
call
them
prophets
they
are
quite
unaware
that
they
are
only
the
expositors
of
dark
sayings
and
visions
and
are
not
to
be
called
prophets
at
all
but
only
interpreters
of
prophecy
such
is
the
nature
of
the
liver
which
is
placed
as
we
have
described
in
order
that
it
may
give
prophetic
intimations
during
the
life
of
each
individual
these
intimations
are
plainer
but
after
his
death
the
liver
becomes
blind
and
delivers
oracles
too
obscure
to
be
intelligible
the
neighbouring
organ
the
spleen
is
situated
on
the
side
and
is
constructed
with
a
view
of
keeping
the
liver
bright
and
pure
like
a
napkin
always
ready
prepared
and
at
hand
to
clean
the
mirror
and
hence
when
any
impurities
arise
in
the
region
of
the
liver
by
reason
of
disorders
of
the
body
the
loose
nature
of
the
spleen
which
is
composed
of
a
hollow
and
bloodless
tissue
receives
them
all
and
clears
them
away
and
when
filled
with
the
unclean
matter
swells
and
festers
but
again
when
the
body
is
purged
settles
down
into
the
same
place
as
before
and
is
humbled
concerning
the
soul
as
to
which
part
is
mortal
and
which
divine
and
how
and
why
they
are
separated
and
where
located
if
god
acknowledges
that
we
have
spoken
the
truth
then
and
then
only
can
we
be
confident
still
we
may
venture
to
assert
that
what
has
been
said
by
us
is
probable
and
will
be
rendered
more
probable
by
investigation
let
us
assume
thus
much
the
creation
of
the
rest
of
the
body
follows
next
in
order
and
this
we
may
investigate
in
a
similar
manner
and
it
appears
to
be
very
meet
that
the
body
should
be
framed
on
the
following
principles
the
authors
of
our
race
were
aware
that
we
should
be
intemperate
in
eating
and
drinking
and
take
a
good
deal
more
than
was
necessary
or
proper
by
reason
of
gluttony
in
order
then
that
disease
might
not
quickly
destroy
us
and
lest
our
mortal
race
should
perish
without
fulfilling
its
end
intending
to
provide
against
this
the
gods
made
what
is
called
the
lower
belly
to
be
a
receptacle
for
the
superfluous
meat
and
drink
and
formed
the
convolution
of
the
bowels
so
that
the
food
might
be
prevented
from
passing
quickly
through
and
compelling
the
body
to
require
more
food
thus
producing
insatiable
gluttony
and
making
the
whole
race
an
enemy
to
philosophy
and
music
and
rebellious
against
the
divinest
element
within
us
the
bones
and
flesh
and
other
similar
parts
of
us
were
made
as
follows
the
first
principle
of
all
of
them
was
the
generation
of
the
marrow
for
the
bonds
of
life
which
unite
the
soul
with
the
body
are
made
fast
there
and
they
are
the
root
and
foundation
of
the
human
race
the
marrow
itself
is
created
out
of
other
materials
god
took
such
of
the
primary
triangles
as
were
straight
and
smooth
and
were
adapted
by
their
perfection
to
produce
fire
and
water
and
air
and
earth
these
i
say
he
separated
from
their
kinds
and
mingling
them
in
due
proportions
with
one
another
made
the
marrow
out
of
them
to
be
a
universal
seed
of
the
whole
race
of
mankind
and
in
this
seed
he
then
planted
and
enclosed
the
souls
and
in
the
original
distribution
gave
to
the
marrow
as
many
and
various
forms
as
the
different
kinds
of
souls
were
hereafter
to
receive
that
which
like
a
field
was
to
receive
the
divine
seed
he
made
round
every
way
and
called
that
portion
of
the
marrow
brain
intending
that
when
an
animal
was
perfected
the
vessel
containing
this
substance
should
be
the
head
but
that
which
was
intended
to
contain
the
remaining
and
mortal
part
of
the
soul
he
distributed
into
figures
at
once
round
and
elongated
and
he
called
them
all
by
the
name
and
to
these
as
to
anchors
fastening
the
bonds
of
the
whole
soul
he
proceeded
to
fashion
around
them
the
entire
framework
of
our
body
constructing
for
the
marrow
first
of
all
a
complete
covering
of
bone
bone
was
composed
by
him
in
the
following
manner
having
sifted
pure
and
smooth
earth
he
kneaded
it
and
wetted
it
with
marrow
and
after
that
he
put
it
into
fire
and
then
into
water
and
once
more
into
fire
and
again
into
water
in
this
way
by
frequent
transfers
from
one
to
the
other
he
made
it
insoluble
by
either
out
of
this
he
fashioned
as
in
a
lathe
a
globe
made
of
bone
which
he
placed
around
the
brain
and
in
this
he
left
a
narrow
opening
and
around
the
marrow
of
the
neck
and
back
he
formed
vertebrae
which
he
placed
under
one
another
like
pivots
beginning
at
the
head
and
extending
through
the
whole
of
the
trunk
thus
wishing
to
preserve
the
entire
seed
he
enclosed
it
in
a
casing
inserting
joints
and
using
in
the
formation
of
them
the
power
of
the
other
or
diverse
as
an
intermediate
nature
that
they
might
have
motion
and
flexure
then
again
considering
that
the
bone
would
be
too
brittle
and
inflexible
and
when
heated
and
again
cooled
would
soon
mortify
and
destroy
the
seed
within
having
this
in
view
he
contrived
the
sinews
and
the
flesh
that
so
binding
all
the
members
together
by
the
sinews
which
admitted
of
being
stretched
and
relaxed
about
the
vertebrae
he
might
thus
make
the
body
capable
of
flexion
and
extension
while
the
flesh
would
serve
as
a
protection
against
the
summer
heat
and
against
the
winter
cold
and
also
against
falls
softly
and
easily
yielding
to
external
bodies
like
articles
made
of
felt
and
containing
in
itself
a
warm
moisture
which
in
summer
exudes
and
makes
the
surface
damp
would
impart
a
natural
coolness
to
the
whole
body
and
again
in
winter
by
the
help
of
this
internal
warmth
would
form
a
very
tolerable
defence
against
the
frost
which
surrounds
it
and
attacks
it
from
without
he
who
modelled
us
considering
these
things
mixed
earth
with
fire
and
water
and
blended
them
and
making
a
ferment
of
acid
and
salt
he
mingled
it
with
them
and
formed
soft
and
succulent
flesh
as
for
the
sinews
he
made
them
of
a
mixture
of
bone
and
unfermented
flesh
attempered
so
as
to
be
in
a
mean
and
gave
them
a
yellow
colour
wherefore
the
sinews
have
a
firmer
and
more
glutinous
nature
than
flesh
but
a
softer
and
moister
nature
than
the
bones
with
these
god
covered
the
bones
and
marrow
binding
them
together
by
sinews
and
then
enshrouded
them
all
in
an
upper
covering
of
flesh
the
more
living
and
sensitive
of
the
bones
he
enclosed
in
the
thinnest
film
of
flesh
and
those
which
had
the
least
life
within
them
in
the
thickest
and
most
solid
flesh
so
again
on
the
joints
of
the
bones
where
reason
indicated
that
no
more
was
required
he
placed
only
a
thin
covering
of
flesh
that
it
might
not
interfere
with
the
flexion
of
our
bodies
and
make
them
unwieldy
because
difficult
to
move
and
also
that
it
might
not
by
being
crowded
and
pressed
and
matted
together
destroy
sensation
by
reason
of
its
hardness
and
impair
the
memory
and
dull
the
edge
of
intelligence
wherefore
also
the
thighs
and
the
shanks
and
the
hips
and
the
bones
of
the
arms
and
the
forearms
and
other
parts
which
have
no
joints
and
the
inner
bones
which
on
account
of
the
rarity
of
the
soul
in
the
marrow
are
destitute
of
reason
all
these
are
abundantly
provided
with
flesh
but
such
as
have
mind
in
them
are
in
general
less
fleshy
except
where
the
creator
has
made
some
part
solely
of
flesh
in
order
to
give
sensation
as
for
example
the
tongue
but
commonly
this
is
not
the
case
for
the
nature
which
comes
into
being
and
grows
up
in
us
by
a
law
of
necessity
does
not
admit
of
the
combination
of
solid
bone
and
much
flesh
with
acute
perceptions
more
than
any
other
part
the
framework
of
the
head
would
have
had
them
if
they
could
have
and
the
human
race
having
a
strong
and
fleshy
and
sinewy
head
would
have
had
a
life
twice
or
many
times
as
long
as
it
now
has
and
also
more
healthy
and
free
from
pain
but
our
creators
considering
whether
they
should
make
a
race
which
was
worse
or
a
race
which
was
better
came
to
the
conclusion
that
every
one
ought
to
prefer
a
shorter
span
of
life
which
was
better
to
a
longer
one
which
was
worse
and
therefore
they
covered
the
head
with
thin
bone
but
not
with
flesh
and
sinews
since
it
had
no
joints
and
thus
the
head
was
added
having
more
wisdom
and
sensation
than
the
rest
of
the
body
but
also
being
in
every
man
far
weaker
for
these
reasons
and
after
this
manner
god
placed
the
sinews
at
the
extremity
of
the
head
in
a
circle
round
the
neck
and
glued
them
together
by
the
principle
of
likeness
and
fastened
the
extremities
of
the
jawbones
to
them
below
the
face
and
the
other
sinews
he
dispersed
throughout
the
body
fastening
limb
to
limb
the
framers
of
us
framed
the
mouth
as
now
arranged
having
teeth
and
tongue
and
lips
with
a
view
to
the
necessary
and
the
good
contriving
the
way
in
for
necessary
purposes
the
way
out
for
the
best
purposes
for
that
is
necessary
which
enters
in
and
gives
food
to
the
body
but
the
river
of
speech
which
flows
out
of
a
man
and
ministers
to
the
intelligence
is
the
fairest
and
noblest
of
all
streams
still
the
head
could
neither
be
left
a
bare
frame
of
bones
on
account
of
the
extremes
of
heat
and
cold
in
the
different
seasons
nor
yet
be
allowed
to
be
wholly
covered
and
so
become
dull
and
senseless
by
reason
of
an
overgrowth
of
flesh
the
fleshy
nature
was
not
therefore
wholly
dried
up
but
a
large
sort
of
peel
was
parted
off
and
remained
over
which
is
now
called
the
skin
this
met
and
grew
by
the
help
of
the
cerebral
moisture
and
became
the
circular
envelopment
of
the
head
and
the
moisture
rising
up
under
the
sutures
watered
and
closed
in
the
skin
upon
the
crown
forming
a
sort
of
knot
the
diversity
of
the
sutures
was
caused
by
the
power
of
the
courses
of
the
soul
and
of
the
food
and
the
more
these
struggled
against
one
another
the
more
numerous
they
became
and
fewer
if
the
struggle
were
less
violent
this
skin
the
divine
power
pierced
all
round
with
fire
and
out
of
the
punctures
which
were
thus
made
the
moisture
issued
forth
and
the
liquid
and
heat
which
was
pure
came
away
and
a
mixed
part
which
was
composed
of
the
same
material
as
the
skin
and
had
a
fineness
equal
to
the
punctures
was
borne
up
by
its
own
impulse
and
extended
far
outside
the
head
but
being
too
slow
to
escape
was
thrust
back
by
the
external
air
and
rolled
up
underneath
the
skin
where
it
took
root
thus
the
hair
sprang
up
in
the
skin
being
akin
to
it
because
it
is
like
threads
of
leather
but
rendered
harder
and
closer
through
the
pressure
of
the
cold
by
which
each
hair
while
in
process
of
separation
from
the
skin
is
compressed
and
cooled
wherefore
the
creator
formed
the
head
hairy
making
use
of
the
causes
which
i
have
mentioned
and
reflecting
also
that
instead
of
flesh
the
brain
needed
the
hair
to
be
a
light
covering
or
guard
which
would
give
shade
in
summer
and
shelter
in
winter
and
at
the
same
time
would
not
impede
our
quickness
of
perception
from
the
combination
of
sinew
skin
and
bone
in
the
structure
of
the
finger
there
arises
a
triple
compound
which
when
dried
up
takes
the
form
of
one
hard
skin
partaking
of
all
three
natures
and
was
fabricated
by
these
second
causes
but
designed
by
mind
which
is
the
principal
cause
with
an
eye
to
the
future
for
our
creators
well
knew
that
women
and
other
animals
would
some
day
be
framed
out
of
men
and
they
further
knew
that
many
animals
would
require
the
use
of
nails
for
many
purposes
wherefore
they
fashioned
in
men
at
their
first
creation
the
rudiments
of
nails
for
this
purpose
and
for
these
reasons
they
caused
skin
hair
and
nails
to
grow
at
the
extremities
of
the
limbs
and
now
that
all
the
parts
and
members
of
the
mortal
animal
had
come
together
since
its
life
of
necessity
consisted
of
fire
and
breath
and
it
therefore
wasted
away
by
dissolution
and
depletion
the
gods
contrived
the
following
remedy
they
mingled
a
nature
akin
to
that
of
man
with
other
forms
and
perceptions
and
thus
created
another
kind
of
animal
these
are
the
trees
and
plants
and
seeds
which
have
been
improved
by
cultivation
and
are
now
domesticated
among
us
anciently
there
were
only
the
wild
kinds
which
are
older
than
the
cultivated
for
everything
that
partakes
of
life
may
be
truly
called
a
living
being
and
the
animal
of
which
we
are
now
speaking
partakes
of
the
third
kind
of
soul
which
is
said
to
be
seated
between
the
midriff
and
the
navel
having
no
part
in
opinion
or
reason
or
mind
but
only
in
feelings
of
pleasure
and
pain
and
the
desires
which
accompany
them
for
this
nature
is
always
in
a
passive
state
revolving
in
and
about
itself
repelling
the
motion
from
without
and
using
its
own
and
accordingly
is
not
endowed
by
nature
with
the
power
of
observing
or
reflecting
on
its
own
concerns
wherefore
it
lives
and
does
not
differ
from
a
living
being
but
is
fixed
and
rooted
in
the
same
spot
having
no
power
of
now
after
the
superior
powers
had
created
all
these
natures
to
be
food
for
us
who
are
of
the
inferior
nature
they
cut
various
channels
through
the
body
as
through
a
garden
that
it
might
be
watered
as
from
a
running
stream
in
the
first
place
they
cut
two
hidden
channels
or
veins
down
the
back
where
the
skin
and
the
flesh
join
which
answered
severally
to
the
right
and
left
side
of
the
body
these
they
let
down
along
the
backbone
so
as
to
have
the
marrow
of
generation
between
them
where
it
was
most
likely
to
flourish
and
in
order
that
the
stream
coming
down
from
above
might
flow
freely
to
the
other
parts
and
equalize
the
irrigation
in
the
next
place
they
divided
the
veins
about
the
head
and
interlacing
them
they
sent
them
in
opposite
directions
those
coming
from
the
right
side
they
sent
to
the
left
of
the
body
and
those
from
the
left
they
diverted
towards
the
right
so
that
they
and
the
skin
might
together
form
a
bond
which
should
fasten
the
head
to
the
body
since
the
crown
of
the
head
was
not
encircled
by
sinews
and
also
in
order
that
the
sensations
from
both
sides
might
be
distributed
over
the
whole
body
and
next
they
ordered
the
of
the
body
in
a
manner
which
i
will
describe
and
which
will
be
more
easily
understood
if
we
begin
by
admitting
that
all
things
which
have
lesser
parts
retain
the
greater
but
the
greater
can
not
retain
the
lesser
now
of
all
natures
fire
has
the
smallest
parts
and
therefore
penetrates
through
earth
and
water
and
air
and
their
compounds
nor
can
anything
hold
it
and
a
similar
principle
applies
to
the
human
belly
for
when
meats
and
drinks
enter
it
it
holds
them
but
it
can
not
hold
air
and
fire
because
the
particles
of
which
they
consist
are
smaller
than
its
own
structure
these
elements
therefore
god
employed
for
the
sake
of
distributing
moisture
from
the
belly
into
the
veins
weaving
together
a
network
of
fire
and
air
like
a
weel
having
at
the
entrance
two
lesser
weels
further
he
constructed
one
of
these
with
two
openings
and
from
the
lesser
weels
he
extended
cords
reaching
all
round
to
the
extremities
of
the
network
all
the
interior
of
the
net
he
made
of
fire
but
the
lesser
weels
and
their
cavity
of
air
the
network
he
took
and
spread
over
the
animal
in
the
following
manner
he
let
the
lesser
weels
pass
into
the
mouth
there
were
two
of
them
and
one
he
let
down
by
the
into
the
lungs
the
other
by
the
side
of
the
into
the
belly
the
former
he
divided
into
two
branches
both
of
which
he
made
to
meet
at
the
channels
of
the
nose
so
that
when
the
way
through
the
mouth
did
not
act
the
streams
of
the
mouth
as
well
were
replenished
through
the
nose
with
the
other
cavity
of
the
greater
weel
he
enveloped
the
hollow
parts
of
the
body
and
at
one
time
he
made
all
this
to
flow
into
the
lesser
weels
quite
gently
for
they
are
composed
of
air
and
at
another
time
he
caused
the
lesser
weels
to
flow
back
again
and
the
net
he
made
to
find
a
way
in
and
out
through
the
pores
of
the
body
and
the
rays
of
fire
which
are
bound
fast
within
followed
the
passage
of
the
air
either
way
never
at
any
time
ceasing
so
long
as
the
mortal
being
holds
together
this
process
as
we
affirm
the
named
inspiration
and
expiration
and
all
this
movement
active
as
well
as
passive
takes
place
in
order
that
the
body
being
watered
and
cooled
may
receive
nourishment
and
life
for
when
the
respiration
is
going
in
and
out
and
the
fire
which
is
fast
bound
within
follows
it
and
ever
and
anon
moving
to
and
fro
enters
through
the
belly
and
reaches
the
meat
and
drink
it
dissolves
them
and
dividing
them
into
small
portions
and
guiding
them
through
the
passages
where
it
goes
pumps
them
as
from
a
fountain
into
the
channels
of
the
veins
and
makes
the
stream
of
the
veins
flow
through
the
body
as
through
a
conduit
let
us
once
more
consider
the
phenomena
of
respiration
and
enquire
into
the
causes
which
have
made
it
what
it
is
they
are
as
follows
seeing
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
vacuum
into
which
any
of
those
things
which
are
moved
can
enter
and
the
breath
is
carried
from
us
into
the
external
air
the
next
point
is
as
will
be
clear
to
every
one
that
it
does
not
go
into
a
vacant
space
but
pushes
its
neighbour
out
of
its
place
and
that
which
is
thrust
out
in
turn
drives
out
its
neighbour
and
in
this
way
everything
of
necessity
at
last
comes
round
to
that
place
from
whence
the
breath
came
forth
and
enters
in
there
and
following
the
breath
fills
up
the
vacant
space
and
this
goes
on
like
the
rotation
of
a
wheel
because
there
can
be
no
such
thing
as
a
vacuum
wherefore
also
the
breast
and
the
lungs
when
they
emit
the
breath
are
replenished
by
the
air
which
surrounds
the
body
and
which
enters
in
through
the
pores
of
the
flesh
and
is
driven
round
in
a
circle
and
again
the
air
which
is
sent
away
and
passes
out
through
the
body
forces
the
breath
inwards
through
the
passage
of
the
mouth
and
the
nostrils
now
the
origin
of
this
movement
may
be
supposed
to
be
as
follows
in
the
interior
of
every
animal
the
hottest
part
is
that
which
is
around
the
blood
and
veins
it
is
in
a
manner
an
internal
fountain
of
fire
which
we
compare
to
the
network
of
a
creel
being
woven
all
of
fire
and
extended
through
the
centre
of
the
body
while
the
outer
parts
are
composed
of
air
now
we
must
admit
that
heat
naturally
proceeds
outward
to
its
own
place
and
to
its
kindred
element
and
as
there
are
two
exits
for
the
heat
the
one
out
through
the
body
and
the
other
through
the
mouth
and
nostrils
when
it
moves
towards
the
one
it
drives
round
the
air
at
the
other
and
that
which
is
driven
round
falls
into
the
fire
and
becomes
warm
and
that
which
goes
forth
is
cooled
but
when
the
heat
changes
its
place
and
the
particles
at
the
other
exit
grow
warmer
the
hotter
air
inclining
in
that
direction
and
carried
towards
its
native
element
fire
pushes
round
the
air
at
the
other
and
this
being
affected
in
the
same
way
and
communicating
the
same
impulse
a
circular
motion
swaying
to
and
fro
is
produced
by
the
double
process
which
we
call
inspiration
and
expiration
the
phenomena
of
medical
and
of
the
swallowing
of
drink
and
of
the
projection
of
bodies
whether
discharged
in
the
air
or
bowled
along
the
ground
are
to
be
investigated
on
a
similar
principle
and
swift
and
slow
sounds
which
appear
to
be
high
and
low
and
are
sometimes
discordant
on
account
of
their
inequality
and
then
again
harmonical
on
account
of
the
equality
of
the
motion
which
they
excite
in
us
for
when
the
motions
of
the
antecedent
swifter
sounds
begin
to
pause
and
the
two
are
equalized
the
slower
sounds
overtake
the
swifter
and
then
propel
them
when
they
overtake
them
they
do
not
intrude
a
new
and
discordant
motion
but
introduce
the
beginnings
of
a
slower
which
answers
to
the
swifter
as
it
dies
away
thus
producing
a
single
mixed
expression
out
of
high
and
low
whence
arises
a
pleasure
which
even
the
unwise
feel
and
which
to
the
wise
becomes
a
higher
sort
of
delight
being
an
imitation
of
divine
harmony
in
mortal
motions
moreover
as
to
the
flowing
of
water
the
fall
of
the
thunderbolt
and
the
marvels
that
are
observed
about
the
attraction
of
amber
and
the
heraclean
stones
in
none
of
these
cases
is
there
any
attraction
but
he
who
investigates
rightly
will
find
that
such
wonderful
phenomena
are
attributable
to
the
combination
of
certain
conditions
the
of
a
vacuum
the
fact
that
objects
push
one
another
round
and
that
they
change
places
passing
severally
into
their
proper
positions
as
they
are
divided
or
combined
such
as
we
have
seen
is
the
nature
and
such
are
the
causes
of
respiration
the
subject
in
which
this
discussion
originated
for
the
fire
cuts
the
food
and
following
the
breath
surges
up
within
fire
and
breath
rising
together
and
filling
the
veins
by
drawing
up
out
of
the
belly
and
pouring
into
them
the
cut
portions
of
the
food
and
so
the
streams
of
food
are
kept
flowing
through
the
whole
body
in
all
animals
and
fresh
cuttings
from
kindred
substances
whether
the
fruits
of
the
earth
or
herb
of
the
field
which
god
planted
to
be
our
daily
food
acquire
all
sorts
of
colours
by
their
but
red
is
the
most
pervading
of
them
being
created
by
the
cutting
action
of
fire
and
by
the
impression
which
it
makes
on
a
moist
substance
and
hence
the
liquid
which
circulates
in
the
body
has
a
colour
such
as
we
have
described
the
liquid
itself
we
call
blood
which
nourishes
the
flesh
and
the
whole
body
whence
all
parts
are
watered
and
empty
places
filled
now
the
process
of
repletion
and
evacuation
is
effected
after
the
manner
of
the
universal
motion
by
which
all
kindred
substances
are
drawn
towards
one
another
for
the
external
elements
which
surround
us
are
always
causing
us
to
consume
away
and
distributing
and
sending
off
like
to
like
the
particles
of
blood
too
which
are
divided
and
contained
within
the
frame
of
the
animal
as
in
a
sort
of
heaven
are
compelled
to
imitate
the
motion
of
the
universe
each
therefore
of
the
divided
parts
within
us
being
carried
to
its
kindred
nature
replenishes
the
void
when
more
is
taken
away
than
flows
in
then
we
decay
and
when
less
we
grow
and
increase
the
frame
of
the
entire
creature
when
young
has
the
triangles
of
each
kind
new
and
may
be
compared
to
the
keel
of
a
vessel
which
is
just
off
the
stocks
they
are
locked
firmly
together
and
yet
the
whole
mass
is
soft
and
delicate
being
freshly
formed
of
marrow
and
nurtured
on
milk
now
when
the
triangles
out
of
which
meats
and
drinks
are
composed
come
in
from
without
and
are
comprehended
in
the
body
being
older
and
weaker
than
the
triangles
already
there
the
frame
of
the
body
gets
the
better
of
them
and
its
newer
triangles
cut
them
up
and
so
the
animal
grows
great
being
nourished
by
a
multitude
of
similar
particles
but
when
the
roots
of
the
triangles
are
loosened
by
having
undergone
many
conflicts
with
many
things
in
the
course
of
time
they
are
no
longer
able
to
cut
or
assimilate
the
food
which
enters
but
are
themselves
easily
divided
by
the
bodies
which
come
in
from
without
in
this
way
every
animal
is
overcome
and
decays
and
this
affection
is
called
old
age
and
at
last
when
the
bonds
by
which
the
triangles
of
the
marrow
are
united
no
longer
hold
and
are
parted
by
the
strain
of
existence
they
in
turn
loosen
the
bonds
of
the
soul
and
she
obtaining
a
natural
release
flies
away
with
joy
for
that
which
takes
place
according
to
nature
is
pleasant
but
that
which
is
contrary
to
nature
is
painful
and
thus
death
if
caused
by
disease
or
produced
by
wounds
is
painful
and
violent
but
that
sort
of
death
which
comes
with
old
age
and
fulfils
the
debt
of
nature
is
the
easiest
of
deaths
and
is
accompanied
with
pleasure
rather
than
with
pain
now
every
one
can
see
whence
diseases
arise
there
are
four
natures
out
of
which
the
body
is
compacted
earth
and
fire
and
water
and
air
and
the
unnatural
excess
or
defect
of
these
or
the
change
of
any
of
them
from
its
own
natural
place
into
another
or
since
there
are
more
kinds
than
one
of
fire
and
of
the
other
elements
the
assumption
by
any
of
these
of
a
wrong
kind
or
any
similar
irregularity
produces
disorders
and
diseases
for
when
any
of
them
is
produced
or
changed
in
a
manner
contrary
to
nature
the
parts
which
were
previously
cool
grow
warm
and
those
which
were
dry
become
moist
and
the
light
become
heavy
and
the
heavy
light
all
sorts
of
changes
occur
for
as
we
affirm
a
thing
can
only
remain
the
same
with
itself
whole
and
sound
when
the
same
is
added
to
it
or
subtracted
from
it
in
the
same
respect
and
in
the
same
manner
and
in
due
proportion
and
whatever
comes
or
goes
away
in
violation
of
these
laws
causes
all
manner
of
changes
and
infinite
diseases
and
corruptions
now
there
is
a
second
class
of
structures
which
are
also
natural
and
this
affords
a
second
opportunity
of
observing
diseases
to
him
who
would
understand
them
for
whereas
marrow
and
bone
and
flesh
and
sinews
are
composed
of
the
four
elements
and
the
blood
though
after
another
manner
is
likewise
formed
out
of
them
most
diseases
originate
in
the
way
which
i
have
described
but
the
worst
of
all
owe
their
severity
to
the
fact
that
the
generation
of
these
substances
proceeds
in
a
wrong
order
they
are
then
destroyed
for
the
natural
order
is
that
the
flesh
and
sinews
should
be
made
of
blood
the
sinews
out
of
the
fibres
to
which
they
are
akin
and
the
flesh
out
of
the
clots
which
are
formed
when
the
fibres
are
separated
and
the
glutinous
and
rich
matter
which
comes
away
from
the
sinews
and
the
flesh
not
only
glues
the
flesh
to
the
bones
but
nourishes
and
imparts
growth
to
the
bone
which
surrounds
the
marrow
and
by
reason
of
the
solidity
of
the
bones
that
which
filters
through
consists
of
the
purest
and
smoothest
and
oiliest
sort
of
triangles
dropping
like
dew
from
the
bones
and
watering
the
marrow
now
when
each
process
takes
place
in
this
order
health
commonly
results
when
in
the
opposite
order
disease
for
when
the
flesh
becomes
decomposed
and
sends
back
the
wasting
substance
into
the
veins
then
an
of
blood
of
diverse
kinds
mingling
with
air
in
the
veins
having
variegated
colours
and
bitter
properties
as
well
as
acid
and
saline
qualities
contains
all
sorts
of
bile
and
serum
and
phlegm
for
all
things
go
the
wrong
way
and
having
become
corrupted
first
they
taint
the
blood
itself
and
then
ceasing
to
give
nourishment
to
the
body
they
are
carried
along
the
veins
in
all
directions
no
longer
preserving
the
order
of
their
natural
courses
but
at
war
with
themselves
because
they
receive
no
good
from
one
another
and
are
hostile
to
the
abiding
constitution
of
the
body
which
they
corrupt
and
dissolve
the
oldest
part
of
the
flesh
which
is
corrupted
being
hard
to
decompose
from
long
burning
grows
black
and
from
being
everywhere
corroded
becomes
bitter
and
is
injurious
to
every
part
of
the
body
which
is
still
uncorrupted
sometimes
when
the
bitter
element
is
refined
away
the
black
part
assumes
an
acidity
which
takes
the
place
of
the
bitterness
at
other
times
the
bitterness
being
tinged
with
blood
has
a
redder
colour
and
this
when
mixed
with
black
takes
the
hue
of
grass
and
again
an
auburn
colour
mingles
with
the
bitter
matter
when
new
flesh
is
decomposed
by
the
fire
which
surrounds
the
internal
flame
to
all
which
symptoms
some
physician
perhaps
or
rather
some
philosopher
who
had
the
power
of
seeing
in
many
dissimilar
things
one
nature
deserving
of
a
name
has
assigned
the
common
name
of
bile
but
the
other
kinds
of
bile
are
variously
distinguished
by
their
colours
as
for
serum
that
sort
which
is
the
watery
part
of
blood
is
innocent
but
that
which
is
a
secretion
of
black
and
acid
bile
is
malignant
when
mingled
by
the
power
of
heat
with
any
salt
substance
and
is
then
called
acid
phlegm
again
the
substance
which
is
formed
by
the
liquefaction
of
new
and
tender
flesh
when
air
is
present
if
inflated
and
encased
in
liquid
so
as
to
form
bubbles
which
separately
are
invisible
owing
to
their
small
size
but
when
collected
are
of
a
bulk
which
is
visible
and
have
a
white
colour
arising
out
of
the
generation
of
foam
all
this
decomposition
of
tender
flesh
when
intermingled
with
air
is
termed
by
us
white
phlegm
and
the
whey
or
sediment
of
phlegm
is
sweat
and
tears
and
includes
the
various
daily
discharges
by
which
the
body
is
purified
now
all
these
become
causes
of
disease
when
the
blood
is
not
replenished
in
a
natural
manner
by
food
and
drink
but
gains
bulk
from
opposite
sources
in
violation
of
the
laws
of
nature
when
the
several
parts
of
the
flesh
are
separated
by
disease
if
the
foundation
remains
the
power
of
the
disorder
is
only
half
as
great
and
there
is
still
a
prospect
of
an
easy
recovery
but
when
that
which
binds
the
flesh
to
the
bones
is
diseased
and
no
longer
being
separated
from
the
muscles
and
sinews
ceases
to
give
nourishment
to
the
bone
and
to
unite
flesh
and
bone
and
from
being
oily
and
smooth
and
glutinous
becomes
rough
and
salt
and
dry
owing
to
bad
regimen
then
all
the
substance
thus
corrupted
crumbles
away
under
the
flesh
and
the
sinews
and
separates
from
the
bone
and
the
fleshy
parts
fall
away
from
their
foundation
and
leave
the
sinews
bare
and
full
of
brine
and
the
flesh
again
gets
into
the
circulation
of
the
blood
and
makes
the
disorders
still
greater
and
if
these
bodily
affections
be
severe
still
worse
are
the
prior
disorders
as
when
the
bone
itself
by
reason
of
the
density
of
the
flesh
does
not
obtain
sufficient
air
but
becomes
mouldy
and
hot
and
gangrened
and
receives
no
nutriment
and
the
natural
process
is
inverted
and
the
bone
crumbling
passes
into
the
food
and
the
food
into
the
flesh
and
the
flesh
again
falling
into
the
blood
makes
all
maladies
that
may
occur
more
virulent
than
those
already
mentioned
but
the
worst
case
of
all
is
when
the
marrow
is
diseased
either
from
excess
or
defect
and
this
is
the
cause
of
the
very
greatest
and
most
fatal
disorders
in
which
the
whole
course
of
the
body
is
reversed
there
is
a
third
class
of
diseases
which
may
be
conceived
of
as
arising
in
three
ways
for
they
are
produced
sometimes
by
wind
and
sometimes
by
phlegm
and
sometimes
by
bile
when
the
lung
which
is
the
dispenser
of
the
air
to
the
body
is
obstructed
by
rheums
and
its
passages
are
not
free
some
of
them
not
acting
while
through
others
too
much
air
enters
then
the
parts
which
are
unrefreshed
by
air
corrode
while
in
other
parts
the
excess
of
air
forcing
its
way
through
the
veins
distorts
them
and
decomposing
the
body
is
enclosed
in
the
midst
of
it
and
occupies
the
midriff
thus
numberless
painful
diseases
are
produced
accompanied
by
copious
sweats
and
oftentimes
when
the
flesh
is
dissolved
in
the
body
wind
generated
within
and
unable
to
escape
is
the
source
of
quite
as
much
pain
as
the
air
coming
in
from
without
but
the
greatest
pain
is
felt
when
the
wind
gets
about
the
sinews
and
the
veins
of
the
shoulders
and
swells
them
up
and
so
twists
back
the
great
tendons
and
the
sinews
which
are
connected
with
them
these
disorders
are
called
tetanus
and
opisthotonus
by
reason
of
the
tension
which
accompanies
them
the
cure
of
them
is
difficult
relief
is
in
most
cases
given
by
fever
supervening
the
white
phlegm
though
dangerous
when
detained
within
by
reason
of
the
yet
if
it
can
communicate
with
the
outside
air
is
less
severe
and
only
discolours
the
body
generating
leprous
eruptions
and
similar
diseases
when
it
is
mingled
with
black
bile
and
dispersed
about
the
courses
of
the
head
which
are
the
divinest
part
of
us
the
attack
if
coming
on
in
sleep
is
not
so
severe
but
when
assailing
those
who
are
awake
it
is
hard
to
be
got
rid
of
and
being
an
affection
of
a
sacred
part
is
most
justly
called
sacred
an
acid
and
salt
phlegm
again
is
the
source
of
all
those
diseases
which
take
the
form
of
catarrh
but
they
have
many
names
because
the
places
into
which
they
flow
are
manifold
inflammations
of
the
body
come
from
burnings
and
inflamings
and
all
of
them
originate
in
bile
when
bile
finds
a
means
of
discharge
it
boils
up
and
sends
forth
all
sorts
of
tumours
but
when
imprisoned
within
it
generates
many
inflammatory
diseases
above
all
when
mingled
with
pure
blood
since
it
then
displaces
the
fibres
which
are
scattered
about
in
the
blood
and
are
designed
to
maintain
the
balance
of
rare
and
dense
in
order
that
the
blood
may
not
be
so
liquefied
by
heat
as
to
exude
from
the
pores
of
the
body
nor
again
become
too
dense
and
thus
find
a
difficulty
in
circulating
through
the
veins
the
fibres
are
so
constituted
as
to
maintain
this
balance
and
if
any
one
brings
them
all
together
when
the
blood
is
dead
and
in
process
of
cooling
then
the
blood
which
remains
becomes
fluid
but
if
they
are
left
alone
they
soon
congeal
by
reason
of
the
surrounding
cold
the
fibres
having
this
power
over
the
blood
bile
which
is
only
stale
blood
and
which
from
being
flesh
is
dissolved
again
into
blood
at
the
first
influx
coming
in
little
by
little
hot
and
liquid
is
congealed
by
the
power
of
the
fibres
and
so
congealing
and
made
to
cool
it
produces
internal
cold
and
shuddering
when
it
enters
with
more
of
a
flood
and
overcomes
the
fibres
by
its
heat
and
boiling
up
throws
them
into
disorder
if
it
have
power
enough
to
maintain
its
supremacy
it
penetrates
the
marrow
and
burns
up
what
may
be
termed
the
cables
of
the
soul
and
sets
her
free
but
when
there
is
not
so
much
of
it
and
the
body
though
wasted
still
holds
out
the
bile
is
itself
mastered
and
is
either
utterly
banished
or
is
thrust
through
the
veins
into
the
lower
or
upper
belly
and
is
driven
out
of
the
body
like
an
exile
from
a
state
in
which
there
has
been
civil
war
whence
arise
diarrhoeas
and
dysenteries
and
all
such
disorders
when
the
constitution
is
disordered
by
excess
of
fire
continuous
heat
and
fever
are
the
result
when
excess
of
air
is
the
cause
then
the
fever
is
quotidian
when
of
water
which
is
a
more
sluggish
element
than
either
fire
or
air
then
the
fever
is
a
tertian
when
of
earth
which
is
the
most
sluggish
of
the
four
and
is
only
purged
away
in
a
period
the
result
is
a
quartan
fever
which
can
with
difficulty
be
shaken
off
such
is
the
manner
in
which
diseases
of
the
body
arise
the
disorders
of
the
soul
which
depend
upon
the
body
originate
as
follows
we
must
acknowledge
disease
of
the
mind
to
be
a
want
of
intelligence
and
of
this
there
are
two
kinds
to
wit
madness
and
ignorance
in
whatever
state
a
man
experiences
either
of
them
that
state
may
be
called
disease
and
excessive
pains
and
pleasures
are
justly
to
be
regarded
as
the
greatest
diseases
to
which
the
soul
is
liable
for
a
man
who
is
in
great
joy
or
in
great
pain
in
his
unreasonable
eagerness
to
attain
the
one
and
to
avoid
the
other
is
not
able
to
see
or
to
hear
anything
rightly
but
he
is
mad
and
is
at
the
time
utterly
incapable
of
any
participation
in
reason
he
who
has
the
seed
about
the
spinal
marrow
too
plentiful
and
overflowing
like
a
tree
overladen
with
fruit
has
many
throes
and
also
obtains
many
pleasures
in
his
desires
and
their
offspring
and
is
for
the
most
part
of
his
life
deranged
because
his
pleasures
and
pains
are
so
very
great
his
soul
is
rendered
foolish
and
disordered
by
his
body
yet
he
is
regarded
not
as
one
diseased
but
as
one
who
is
voluntarily
bad
which
is
a
mistake
the
truth
is
that
the
intemperance
of
love
is
a
disease
of
the
soul
due
chiefly
to
the
moisture
and
fluidity
which
is
produced
in
one
of
the
elements
by
the
loose
consistency
of
the
bones
and
in
general
all
that
which
is
termed
the
incontinence
of
pleasure
and
is
deemed
a
reproach
under
the
idea
that
the
wicked
voluntarily
do
wrong
is
not
justly
a
matter
for
reproach
for
no
man
is
voluntarily
bad
but
the
bad
become
bad
by
reason
of
an
ill
disposition
of
the
body
and
bad
education
things
which
are
hateful
to
every
man
and
happen
to
him
against
his
will
and
in
the
case
of
pain
too
in
like
manner
the
soul
suffers
much
evil
from
the
body
for
where
the
acid
and
briny
phlegm
and
other
bitter
and
bilious
humours
wander
about
in
the
body
and
find
no
exit
or
escape
but
are
pent
up
within
and
mingle
their
own
vapours
with
the
motions
of
the
soul
and
are
blended
with
them
they
produce
all
sorts
of
diseases
more
or
fewer
and
in
every
degree
of
intensity
and
being
carried
to
the
three
places
of
the
soul
whichever
they
may
severally
assail
they
create
infinite
varieties
of
and
melancholy
of
rashness
and
cowardice
and
also
of
forgetfulness
and
stupidity
further
when
to
this
evil
constitution
of
body
evil
forms
of
government
are
added
and
evil
discourses
are
uttered
in
private
as
well
as
in
public
and
no
sort
of
instruction
is
given
in
youth
to
cure
these
evils
then
all
of
us
who
are
bad
become
bad
from
two
causes
which
are
entirely
beyond
our
control
in
such
cases
the
planters
are
to
blame
rather
than
the
plants
the
educators
rather
than
the
educated
but
however
that
may
be
we
should
endeavour
as
far
as
we
can
by
education
and
studies
and
learning
to
avoid
vice
and
attain
virtue
this
however
is
part
of
another
subject
there
is
a
corresponding
enquiry
concerning
the
mode
of
treatment
by
which
the
mind
and
the
body
are
to
be
preserved
about
which
it
is
meet
and
right
that
i
should
say
a
word
in
turn
for
it
is
more
our
duty
to
speak
of
the
good
than
of
the
evil
everything
that
is
good
is
fair
and
the
fair
is
not
without
proportion
and
the
animal
which
is
to
be
fair
must
have
due
proportion
now
we
perceive
lesser
symmetries
or
proportions
and
reason
about
them
but
of
the
highest
and
greatest
we
take
no
heed
for
there
is
no
proportion
or
disproportion
more
productive
of
health
and
disease
and
virtue
and
vice
than
that
between
soul
and
body
this
however
we
do
not
perceive
nor
do
we
reflect
that
when
a
weak
or
small
frame
is
the
vehicle
of
a
great
and
mighty
soul
or
conversely
when
a
little
soul
is
encased
in
a
large
body
then
the
whole
animal
is
not
fair
for
it
lacks
the
most
important
of
all
symmetries
but
the
due
proportion
of
mind
and
body
is
the
fairest
and
loveliest
of
all
sights
to
him
who
has
the
seeing
eye
just
as
a
body
which
has
a
leg
too
long
or
which
is
unsymmetrical
in
some
other
respect
is
an
unpleasant
sight
and
also
when
doing
its
share
of
work
is
much
distressed
and
makes
convulsive
efforts
and
often
stumbles
through
awkwardness
and
is
the
cause
of
infinite
evil
to
its
own
self
in
like
manner
we
should
conceive
of
the
double
nature
which
we
call
the
living
being
and
when
in
this
compound
there
is
an
impassioned
soul
more
powerful
than
the
body
that
soul
i
say
convulses
and
fills
with
disorders
the
whole
inner
nature
of
man
and
when
eager
in
the
pursuit
of
some
sort
of
learning
or
study
causes
wasting
or
again
when
teaching
or
disputing
in
private
or
in
public
and
strifes
and
controversies
arise
inflames
and
dissolves
the
composite
frame
of
man
and
introduces
rheums
and
the
nature
of
this
phenomenon
is
not
understood
by
most
professors
of
medicine
who
ascribe
it
to
the
opposite
of
the
real
cause
and
once
more
when
a
body
large
and
too
strong
for
the
soul
is
united
to
a
small
and
weak
intelligence
then
inasmuch
as
there
are
two
desires
natural
to
man
one
of
food
for
the
sake
of
the
body
and
one
of
wisdom
for
the
sake
of
the
diviner
part
of
us
then
i
say
the
motions
of
the
stronger
getting
the
better
and
increasing
their
own
power
but
making
the
soul
dull
and
stupid
and
forgetful
engender
ignorance
which
is
the
greatest
of
diseases
there
is
one
protection
against
both
kinds
of
disproportion
that
we
should
not
move
the
body
without
the
soul
or
the
soul
without
the
body
and
thus
they
will
be
on
their
guard
against
each
other
and
be
healthy
and
well
balanced
and
therefore
the
mathematician
or
any
one
else
whose
thoughts
are
much
absorbed
in
some
intellectual
pursuit
must
allow
his
body
also
to
have
due
exercise
and
practise
gymnastic
and
he
who
is
careful
to
fashion
the
body
should
in
turn
impart
to
the
soul
its
proper
motions
and
should
cultivate
music
and
all
philosophy
if
he
would
deserve
to
be
called
truly
fair
and
truly
good
and
the
separate
parts
should
be
treated
in
the
same
manner
in
imitation
of
the
pattern
of
the
universe
for
as
the
body
is
heated
and
also
cooled
within
by
the
elements
which
enter
into
it
and
is
again
dried
up
and
moistened
by
external
things
and
experiences
these
and
the
like
affections
from
both
kinds
of
motions
the
result
is
that
the
body
if
given
up
to
motion
when
in
a
state
of
quiescence
is
overmastered
and
perishes
but
if
any
one
in
imitation
of
that
which
we
call
the
and
nurse
of
the
universe
will
not
allow
the
body
ever
to
be
inactive
but
is
always
producing
motions
and
agitations
through
its
whole
extent
which
form
the
natural
defence
against
other
motions
both
internal
and
external
and
by
moderate
exercise
reduces
to
order
according
to
their
affinities
the
particles
and
affections
which
are
wandering
about
the
body
as
we
have
already
said
when
speaking
of
the
universe
he
will
not
allow
enemy
placed
by
the
side
of
enemy
to
stir
up
wars
and
disorders
in
the
body
but
he
will
place
friend
by
the
side
of
friend
so
as
to
create
health
now
of
all
motions
that
is
the
best
which
is
produced
in
a
thing
by
itself
for
it
is
most
akin
to
the
motion
of
thought
and
of
the
universe
but
that
motion
which
is
caused
by
others
is
not
so
good
and
worst
of
all
is
that
which
moves
the
body
when
at
rest
in
parts
only
and
by
some
external
agency
wherefore
of
all
modes
of
purifying
and
the
body
the
best
is
gymnastic
the
next
best
is
a
surging
motion
as
in
sailing
or
any
other
mode
of
conveyance
which
is
not
fatiguing
the
third
sort
of
motion
may
be
of
use
in
a
case
of
extreme
necessity
but
in
any
other
will
be
adopted
by
no
man
of
sense
i
mean
the
purgative
treatment
of
physicians
for
diseases
unless
they
are
very
dangerous
should
not
be
irritated
by
medicines
since
every
form
of
disease
is
in
a
manner
akin
to
the
living
being
whose
complex
frame
has
an
appointed
term
of
life
for
not
the
whole
race
only
but
each
individual
barring
inevitable
accidents
comes
into
the
world
having
a
fixed
span
and
the
triangles
in
us
are
originally
framed
with
power
to
last
for
a
certain
time
beyond
which
no
man
can
prolong
his
life
and
this
holds
also
of
the
constitution
of
diseases
if
any
one
regardless
of
the
appointed
time
tries
to
subdue
them
by
medicine
he
only
aggravates
and
multiplies
them
wherefore
we
ought
always
to
manage
them
by
regimen
as
far
as
a
man
can
spare
the
time
and
not
provoke
a
disagreeable
enemy
by
medicines
enough
of
the
composite
animal
and
of
the
body
which
is
a
part
of
him
and
of
the
manner
in
which
a
man
may
train
and
be
trained
by
himself
so
as
to
live
most
according
to
reason
and
we
must
above
and
before
all
provide
that
the
element
which
is
to
train
him
shall
be
the
fairest
and
best
adapted
to
that
purpose
a
minute
discussion
of
this
subject
would
be
a
serious
task
but
if
as
before
i
am
to
give
only
an
outline
the
subject
may
not
unfitly
be
summed
up
as
follows
i
have
often
remarked
that
there
are
three
kinds
of
soul
located
within
us
having
each
of
them
motions
and
i
must
now
repeat
in
the
fewest
words
possible
that
one
part
if
remaining
inactive
and
ceasing
from
its
natural
motion
must
necessarily
become
very
weak
but
that
which
is
trained
and
exercised
very
strong
wherefore
we
should
take
care
that
the
movements
of
the
different
parts
of
the
soul
should
be
in
due
proportion
and
we
should
consider
that
god
gave
the
sovereign
part
of
the
human
soul
to
be
the
divinity
of
each
one
being
that
part
which
as
we
say
dwells
at
the
top
of
the
body
and
inasmuch
as
we
are
a
plant
not
of
an
earthly
but
of
a
heavenly
growth
raises
us
from
earth
to
our
kindred
who
are
in
heaven
and
in
this
we
say
truly
for
the
divine
power
suspended
the
head
and
root
of
us
from
that
place
where
the
generation
of
the
soul
first
began
and
thus
made
the
whole
body
upright
when
a
man
is
always
occupied
with
the
cravings
of
desire
and
ambition
and
is
eagerly
striving
to
satisfy
them
all
his
thoughts
must
be
mortal
and
as
far
as
it
is
possible
altogether
to
become
such
he
must
be
mortal
every
whit
because
he
has
cherished
his
mortal
part
but
he
who
has
been
earnest
in
the
love
of
knowledge
and
of
true
wisdom
and
has
exercised
his
intellect
more
than
any
other
part
of
him
must
have
thoughts
immortal
and
divine
if
he
attain
truth
and
in
so
far
as
human
nature
is
capable
of
sharing
in
immortality
he
must
altogether
be
immortal
and
since
he
is
ever
cherishing
the
divine
power
and
has
the
divinity
within
him
in
perfect
order
he
will
be
perfectly
happy
now
there
is
only
one
way
of
taking
care
of
things
and
this
is
to
give
to
each
the
food
and
motion
which
are
natural
to
it
and
the
motions
which
are
naturally
akin
to
the
divine
principle
within
us
are
the
thoughts
and
revolutions
of
the
universe
these
each
man
should
follow
and
correct
the
courses
of
the
head
which
were
corrupted
at
our
birth
and
by
learning
the
harmonies
and
revolutions
of
the
universe
should
assimilate
the
thinking
being
to
the
thought
renewing
his
original
nature
and
having
assimilated
them
should
attain
to
that
perfect
life
which
the
gods
have
set
before
mankind
both
for
the
present
and
the
future
thus
our
original
design
of
discoursing
about
the
universe
down
to
the
creation
of
man
is
nearly
completed
a
brief
mention
may
be
made
of
the
generation
of
other
animals
so
far
as
the
subject
admits
of
brevity
in
this
manner
our
argument
will
best
attain
a
due
proportion
on
the
subject
of
animals
then
the
following
remarks
may
be
offered
of
the
men
who
came
into
the
world
those
who
were
cowards
or
led
unrighteous
lives
may
with
reason
be
supposed
to
have
changed
into
the
nature
of
women
in
the
second
generation
and
this
was
the
reason
why
at
that
time
the
gods
created
in
us
the
desire
of
sexual
intercourse
contriving
in
man
one
animated
substance
and
in
woman
another
which
they
formed
respectively
in
the
following
manner
the
outlet
for
drink
by
which
liquids
pass
through
the
lung
under
the
kidneys
and
into
the
bladder
which
receives
and
then
by
the
pressure
of
the
air
emits
them
was
so
fashioned
by
them
as
to
penetrate
also
into
the
body
of
the
marrow
which
passes
from
the
head
along
the
neck
and
through
the
back
and
which
in
the
preceding
discourse
we
have
named
the
seed
and
the
seed
having
life
and
becoming
endowed
with
respiration
produces
in
that
part
in
which
it
respires
a
lively
desire
of
emission
and
thus
creates
in
us
the
love
of
procreation
wherefore
also
in
men
the
organ
of
generation
becoming
rebellious
and
masterful
like
an
animal
disobedient
to
reason
and
maddened
with
the
sting
of
lust
seeks
to
gain
absolute
sway
and
the
same
is
the
case
with
the
womb
or
matrix
of
women
the
animal
within
them
is
desirous
of
procreating
children
and
when
remaining
unfruitful
long
beyond
its
proper
time
gets
discontented
and
angry
and
wandering
in
every
direction
through
the
body
closes
up
the
passages
of
the
breath
and
by
obstructing
respiration
drives
them
to
extremity
causing
all
varieties
of
disease
until
at
length
the
desire
and
love
of
the
man
and
the
woman
bringing
them
together
and
as
it
were
plucking
the
fruit
from
the
tree
sow
in
the
womb
as
in
a
field
animals
unseen
by
reason
of
their
smallness
and
without
form
these
again
are
separated
and
matured
within
they
are
then
finally
brought
out
into
the
light
and
thus
the
generation
of
animals
is
completed
thus
were
created
women
and
the
female
sex
in
general
but
the
race
of
birds
was
created
out
of
innocent
men
who
although
their
minds
were
directed
toward
heaven
imagined
in
their
simplicity
that
the
clearest
demonstration
of
the
things
above
was
to
be
obtained
by
sight
these
were
remodelled
and
transformed
into
birds
and
they
grew
feathers
instead
of
hair
the
race
of
wild
pedestrian
animals
again
came
from
those
who
had
no
philosophy
in
any
of
their
thoughts
and
never
considered
at
all
about
the
nature
of
the
heavens
because
they
had
ceased
to
use
the
courses
of
the
head
but
followed
the
guidance
of
those
parts
of
the
soul
which
are
in
the
breast
in
consequence
of
these
habits
of
theirs
they
had
their
and
their
heads
resting
upon
the
earth
to
which
they
were
drawn
by
natural
affinity
and
the
crowns
of
their
heads
were
elongated
and
of
all
sorts
of
shapes
into
which
the
courses
of
the
soul
were
crushed
by
reason
of
disuse
and
this
was
the
reason
why
they
were
created
quadrupeds
and
polypods
god
gave
the
more
senseless
of
them
the
more
support
that
they
might
be
more
attracted
to
the
earth
and
the
most
foolish
of
them
who
trail
their
bodies
entirely
upon
the
ground
and
have
no
longer
any
need
of
feet
he
made
without
feet
to
crawl
upon
the
earth
the
fourth
class
were
the
inhabitants
of
the
water
these
were
made
out
of
the
most
entirely
senseless
and
ignorant
of
all
whom
the
transformers
did
not
think
any
longer
worthy
of
pure
respiration
because
they
possessed
a
soul
which
was
made
impure
by
all
sorts
of
transgression
and
instead
of
the
subtle
and
pure
medium
of
air
they
gave
them
the
deep
and
muddy
sea
to
be
their
element
of
respiration
and
hence
arose
the
race
of
fishes
and
oysters
and
other
aquatic
animals
which
have
received
the
most
remote
habitations
as
a
punishment
of
their
outlandish
ignorance
these
are
the
laws
by
which
animals
pass
into
one
another
now
as
ever
changing
as
they
lose
or
gain
wisdom
and
folly
we
may
now
say
that
our
discourse
about
the
nature
of
the
universe
has
an
end
the
world
has
received
animals
mortal
and
immortal
and
is
fulfilled
with
them
and
has
become
a
visible
animal
containing
the
visible
the
sensible
god
who
is
the
image
of
the
intellectual
the
greatest
best
fairest
most
perfect
the
one
heaven
