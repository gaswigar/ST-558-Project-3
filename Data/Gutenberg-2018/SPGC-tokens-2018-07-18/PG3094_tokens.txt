ditchingham
may
my
dear
jehu
for
five
long
but
not
unhappy
years
seated
or
journeying
side
by
side
we
have
striven
as
royal
commissioners
to
find
a
means
whereby
our
coasts
may
be
protected
from
the
outrageous
flowing
surges
of
the
sea
i
quote
the
jurists
of
centuries
ago
the
idle
swamps
turned
to
fertility
and
the
barren
hills
clothed
with
forest
also
with
small
success
how
foreshore
may
be
best
defined
what
will
result
from
all
these
labours
i
do
not
know
nor
whether
grave
geologists
ever
read
romance
save
that
which
the
pen
of
time
inscribes
upon
the
rocks
still
in
memory
of
our
fellowship
in
them
i
offer
to
you
this
story
written
in
their
intervals
of
red
eve
the
dauntless
and
of
murgh
gateway
of
the
gods
whose
dreadful
galley
still
sails
from
east
to
west
and
from
west
to
east
yes
and
evermore
shall
sail
your

red
eve
murgh
the
death
they
knew
nothing
of
it
in
england
or
all
the
western
countries
in
those
days
before
crecy
was
fought
when
the
third
edward
sat
upon
the
throne
there
was
none
to
tell
them
of
the
doom
that
the
east
whence
come
light
and
life
death
and
the
decrees
of
god
had
loosed
upon
the
world
not
one
in
a
multitude
in
europe
had
ever
even
heard
of
those
vast
lands
of
far
cathay
peopled
with
hundreds
of
millions
of
yellow
men
lands
which
had
grown
very
old
before
our
own
familiar
states
and
empires
were
carved
out
of
mountain
of
forest
and
of
plain
yet
if
their
eyes
had
been
open
so
that
they
could
see
well
might
they
have
trembled
king
prince
priest
merchant
captain
citizen
and
poor
labouring
hind
well
might
they
all
have
trembled
when
the
east
sent
forth
her
gifts
look
across
the
world
beyond
that
curtain
of
thick
darkness
behold
a
vast
city
of
fantastic
houses
half
buried
in
winter
snows
and
reddened
by
the
lurid
sunset
breaking
through
a
canopy
of
cloud
everywhere
upon
the
temple
squares
and
open
spaces
great
fires
burning
a
strange
fuel
the
bodies
of
thousands
of
mankind
pestilence
was
king
of
that
city
a
pestilence
hitherto
unknown
innumerable
hordes
had
died
and
were
dying
yet
innumerable
hordes
remained
all
the
patient
east
bore
forth
those
still
shapes
that
had
been
theirs
to
love
or
hate
and
their
task
done
turned
to
the
banks
of
the
mighty
river
and
watched
down
the
broad
street
which
ran
between
the
fantastic
houses
advanced
a
procession
toward
the
brown
river
first
marched
a
company
of
priests
clad
in
black
robes
and
carrying
on
poles
lanterns
of
black
paper
lighted
although
the
sun
still
shone
behind
marched
another
company
of
priests
clad
in
white
robes
and
bearing
white
lanterns
also
lighted
but
at
these
none
looked
nor
did
they
listen
to
the
dirges
that
they
sang
for
all
eyes
were
fixed
upon
him
who
filled
the
centre
space
and
upon
his
two
companions
the
first
companion
was
a
lovely
woman
wearing
false
flowers
in
her
streaming
hair
and
beneath
her
bared
breasts
a
kirtle
of
white
silk
life
and
love
embodied
in
radiance
and
beauty
she
danced
in
front
looking
about
her
with
alluring
eyes
and
scattering
petals
of
dead
roses
from
a
basket
which
she
bore
different
was
the
second
companion
who
stalked
behind
so
thin
so
sexless
that
none
could
say
if
the
shape
were
that
of
man
or
woman
dry
streaming
locks
of
an
ashen
countenance
hollow
eyes
a
beetling
brow
lean
shanks
half
hidden
with
a
rotting
rag
hands
which
clutched
miserably
at
the
air
such
was
its
awful
fashion
that
of
new
death
in
all
its
terrors
between
them
touched
of
neither
went
a
man
naked
save
for
a
red
girdle
and
a
long
red
cloak
that
was
fastened
round
his
throat
and
hung
down
from
his
broad
shoulders
there
was
nothing
strange
about
this
man
unless
it
were
perhaps
the
strength
that
seemed
to
flow
from
him
and
the
glance
of
his
icy
eyes
he
was
just
a
burly
yellow
man
whose
age
none
could
tell
for
the
hood
of
the
red
cloak
hid
his
hair
one
who
seemed
to
be
far
removed
from
youth
and
yet
untouched
by
time
he
walked
on
steadily
intently
his
face
immovable
taking
no
heed
only
now
and
again
he
turned
those
long
eyes
of
his
upon
one
of
the
multitude
who
watched
him
pass
crouched
upon
their
knees
in
solemn
silence
always
upon
one
whether
it
were
man
woman
or
child
with
a
glance
meant
for
that
one
and
no
other
and
ever
the
one
upon
whom
it
fell
rose
from
the
knee
made
obeisance
and
departed
as
though
filled
with
some
inspired
purpose
down
to
the
quay
went
the
black
priests
the
white
priests
and
the
man
preceded
by
rose
life
followed
by
ashen
death
through
the
funeral
fires
they
wended
and
the
lurid
sunset
shone
upon
them
all
to
the
pillars
of
this
quay
was
fastened
a
strange
ship
with
crimson
sails
set
upon
her
masts
the
white
priests
and
the
black
priests
formed
lines
upon
either
side
of
the
broad
gangway
of
that
ship
and
bowed
as
the
man
walked
over
it
between
them
quite
alone
for
now
she
with
the
dead
roses
and
she
of
the
ashen
countenance
had
fallen
back
as
the
sun
sank
standing
on
the
lofty
stern
he
cried
aloud
here
the
work
is
done
now
i
the
eating
fire
i
the
messenger
get
me
to
the
west
among
you
for
a
while
i
cease
to
burn
yet
remember
me
for
i
shall
come
as
he
spoke
the
ropes
of
the
ship
were
loosened
the
wind
caught
her
crimson
sails
and
she
departed
into
the
night
one
spot
against
its
blackness
the
multitude
watched
until
they
could
see
her
no
longer
then
they
flamed
up
with
mingled
joy
and
rage
they
laughed
madly
they
cursed
him
who
had
departed
we
live
we
live
we
live
they
cried
murgh
is
gone
murgh
is
gone
kill
his
priests
make
sacrifice
of
his
shadows
murgh
is
gone
bearing
the
curse
of
the
east
into
the
bosom
of
the
west
look
it
follows
him
and
they
pointed
to
a
cloud
of
smoke
or
vapour
in
which
terrible
shapes
seemed
to
move
dimly
that
trailed
after
the
departing
ship
the
black
priests
and
the
white
priests
heard
without
struggle
without
complaint
as
though
they
were
but
taking
part
in
some
set
ceremony
they
kneeled
down
in
lines
upon
the
snow
naked
from
the
waist
up
executioners
with
great
swords
appeared
they
advanced
upon
the
kneeling
lines
without
haste
without
wrath
and
letting
fall
the
heavy
swords
upon
the
patient
outstretched
necks
did
their
grim
office
till
all
were
dead
then
they
turned
to
find
her
of
the
flowers
who
had
danced
before
and
her
of
the
tattered
weeds
who
had
followed
after
purposing
to
cast
them
to
the
funeral
flames
but
these
were
gone
though
none
had
seen
them
go
only
out
of
the
gathering
darkness
from
some
temple
or
a
voice
spoke
like
a
moaning
wind
fools
wailed
the
voice
still
with
you
is
murgh
the
second
thing
created
murgh
who
was
made
to
be
man
s
minister
murgh
the
messenger
shall
reappear
from
beyond
the
setting
sun
ye
can
not
kill
ye
can
not
spare
those
priests
you
seemed
to
slay
he
had
summoned
to
be
his
officers
afar
fools
ye
do
but
serve
as
serves
murgh
gateway
of
the
gods
life
and
death
are
not
in
your
hands
or
in

they
are
in
the
hands
of
the
master
of
murgh
helper
of

of
that
lord
whom
no
eye
hath
seen
but
whose
behests

who
are
born

even
the
mighty
murgh
looser
of
burdens
whom
in
your
foolishness
ye
so
spoke
this
voice
out
of
the
darkness
and
that
night
the
sword
of
the
great
pestilence
was
lifted
from
the
eastern
land
and
there
the
funeral
fires
flared
no
more
chapter
i
the
on
the
very
day
when
murgh
the
messenger
sailed
forth
into
that
uttermost
sea
a
young
man
and
a
maiden
met
together
at
the
blythburgh
marshes
near
to
dunwich
on
the
eastern
coast
of
england
in
this
the
month
of
february
of
the
year
hard
and
bitter
frost
held
suffolk
in
its
grip
the
muddy
stream
of
blyth
it
is
true
was
frozen
only
in
places
since
the
tide
flowing
up
from
the
southwold
harbour
where
it
runs
into
the
sea
between
that
ancient
town
and
the
hamlet
of
walberswick
had
broken
up
the
ice
but
all
else
was
set
hard
and
fast
and
now
toward
sunset
the
cold
was
bitter
stark
and
naked
stood
the
tall
dry
reeds
the
blackbirds
and
starlings
perched
upon
the
willows
seemed
swollen
into
feathery
balls
the
fur
started
on
the
backs
of
hares
and
a
wain
could
travel
in
safety
over
swamps
where
at
any
other
time
a
schoolboy
dared
not
set
his
foot
on
such
an
eve
with
snow
threatening
the
great
marsh
was
utterly
desolate
and
this
was
why
these
two
had
chosen
it
for
their
meeting
place
to
look
on
they
were
a
goodly
pair
the
girl
who
was
clothed
in
the
red
she
always
wore
tall
dark
well
shaped
with
large
black
eyes
and
a
determined
face
one
who
would
make
a
very
stately
woman
the
man
broad
shouldered
with
grey
eyes
that
were
quick
and
almost
fierce
long
limbed
hard
agile
and
healthy
one
who
had
never
known
sickness
who
looked
as
though
the
world
were
his
own
to
master
he
was
young
but
that
day
and
his
simple
dress
a
tunic
of
thick
wool
fastened
round
him
with
a
leathern
belt
to
which
hung
a
short
sword
showed
that
his
degree
was
modest
the
girl
although
she
seemed
his
elder
in
fact
was
only
in
her
twentieth
year
yet
from
her
who
had
been
reared
in
the
hard
school
of
that
cruel
age
childhood
had
long
departed
leaving
her
a
ripened
woman
before
her
time
this
pair
stood
looking
at
each
other
well
cousin
eve
clavering
said
the
man
in
his
clear
voice
why
did
your
message
bid
me
meet
you
in
this
cold
place
because
i
had
a
word
to
say
to
you
cousin
hugh
de
cressi
she
answered
boldly
and
the
marsh
being
so
cold
and
so
lonesome
i
thought
it
suited
to
my
purpose
does
grey
dick
watch
yonder
ay
behind
those
willows
arrow
on
string
and
god
help
him
on
whom
dick
draws
but
what
was
that
word
eve
one
easy
to
understand
she
replied
looking
him
in
the
eyes
farewell
he
shivered
as
though
with
the
cold
and
his
face
changed
an
ill
birthday
greeting
yet
i
feared
it
he
muttered
huskily
but
why
more
now
than
at
any
other
time
would
you
know
hugh
well
the
story
is
short
so
i
ll
let
it
out
our
the
heiress
of
the
de
cheneys
married
twice
did
she
not
and
from
the
first
husband
came
the
de
cressis
and
from
the
second
the
claverings
but
in
this
way
or
in
that
we
claverings
got
the
lands
or
most
of
them
and
you
de
cressis
the
nobler
stock
took
to
merchandise
now
since
those
days
you
have
grown
rich
with
your
fishing
fleets
your
wool
mart
and
your
ferry
dues
at
walberswick
and
southwold
we
too
are
rich
in
manors
and
land
counting
our
acres
by
the
thousand
but
yet
poor
lacking
your
gold
though
yonder
manor
and
she
pointed
to
some
towers
which
rose
far
away
above
the
trees
upon
the
high
land
has
many
mouths
to
feed
also
the
sea
has
robbed
us
at
dunwich
where
i
was
born
taking
our
great
house
and
sundry
streets
that
paid
us
rent
and
your
market
of
southwold
has
starved
out
ours
at
well
what
has
all
this
to
do
with
you
and
me
eve
much
hugh
as
you
should
know
who
have
been
bred
to
trade
and
she
glanced
at
his
merchant
s
dress
between
de
cressi
and
clavering
there
has
been
rivalry
and
feud
for
three
long
generations
when
we
were
children
it
abated
for
a
while
since
your
father
lent
money
to
mine
and
that
is
why
they
suffered
us
to
grow
up
side
by
side
but
then
they
quarrelled
about
the
ferry
that
we
had
set
in
pawn
and
your
father
asked
his
gold
back
again
and
not
getting
it
took
the
ferry
which
i
have
always
held
a
foolish
and
deed
since
from
that
day
forward
the
war
was
open
therefore
hugh
if
we
meet
at
all
it
must
be
in
these
frozen
reeds
or
behind
the
cover
of
a
thicket
like
a
village
slut
and
her
i
know
that
well
enough
eve
who
have
spoken
with
you
but
twice
in
nine
and
he
devoured
her
beautiful
face
with
hungry
eyes
but
of
that
word
farewell
of
that
ill
word
this
hugh
i
have
a
new
suitor
up
yonder
a
fine
french
suitor
a
very
great
lord
indeed
whose
wealth
i
am
told
none
can
number
from
his
mother
he
has
the
valley
of
the
waveney
up
to
bungay
town
ay
and
beyond
and
from
his
father
a
whole
county
in
normandy
five
french
knights
ride
behind
his
banner
and
with
them
ten
squires
and
i
know
not
how
many
there
is
feasting
yonder
at
the
manor
i
can
tell
you
ere
his
train
leaves
us
our
winter
provender
will
be
done
and
we
ll
have
to
drink
small
beer
till
the
wine
ships
come
from
france
in
and
what
is
this
lord
s
name
god
s
truth
he
has
several
she
answered
sir
edmund
acour
in
england
and
in
france
the
high
and
puissant
count
of
noyon
and
in
italy
near
to
the
city
of
venice
for
there
too
he
has
possessions
which
came
to
him
through
his
grandmother
the
seigneur
of
and
having
so
much
does
he
want
you
too
as
i
have
heard
eve
and
if
so
why
so
he
swears
she
answered
slowly
and
as
for
the
reason
why
i
suppose
you
must
seek
it
in
my
face
which
by
has
pleased
his
lordship
since
first
he
saw
it
a
month
ago
at
the
least
he
has
asked
me
in
marriage
of
my
father
who
jumped
at
him
like
a
winter
pike
and
so
i
m
and
do
you
want
him
eve
ay
i
want
him
as
far
as
the
sun
is
from
the
moon
or
the
world
from
either
i
want
him
in
heaven
or
beneath
the
earth
or
anywhere
away
from
at
these
words
a
light
shone
in
hugh
s
keen
grey
eyes
i
m
glad
of
that
eve
for
i
ve
been
told
much
of
this
fine
fellow
amongst
other
things
that
he
is
a
traitor
come
here
to
spy
on
england
but
should
i
be
a
match
for
him
man
to
man
eve
he
asked
after
a
little
pause
she
looked
him
up
and
down
then
answered
i
think
so
though
he
is
no
weakling
but
not
for
him
and
the
five
knights
and
the
ten
squires
and
my
noble
father
and
my
brother
and
the
rest
oh
hugh
hugh
she
added
bitterly
can
not
you
understand
that
you
are
but
a
merchant
s
lad
though
your
blood
be
as
noble
as
any
in
this
realm
a
merchant
s
lad
the
last
of
five
brothers
why
were
you
not
born
the
first
of
them
if
you
wished
for
eve
clavering
for
then
your
red
gold
might
have
bought
ask
that
of
those
who
begot
me
said
hugh
come
now
what
s
in
your
mind
you
re
not
one
to
be
sold
like
a
heifer
at
a
faring
and
go
whimpering
to
the
altar
and
i
am
not
one
to
see
you
led
there
while
i
stand
upon
my
feet
we
are
made
of
a
clay
too
stiff
for
a
french
lord
s
fingers
eve
though
it
is
true
that
they
may
drag
you
whither
you
would
not
no
she
answered
i
think
i
shall
take
some
marrying
against
my
wish
moreover
i
am
dunwich
what
of
that
eve
go
ask
your
godsire
and
my
friend
sir
andrew
arnold
the
old
priest
in
the
library
of
the
temple
there
he
showed
me
an
ancient
roll
a
copy
of
the
charter
granted
by
john
and
other
kings
of
england
to
the
citizens
of
what
said
this
writing
eve
it
said
among
other
things
that
no
man
or
maid
of
dunwich
can
be
forced
to
marry
against
their
will
even
in
the
lifetime
of
their
but
will
it
hold
ay
i
think
so
i
think
that
is
why
the
holy
sir
andrew
showed
it
to
me
knowing
something
of
our
case
for
he
is
my
confessor
when
i
can
get
to
then
sweet
you
are
safe
exclaimed
hugh
with
a
sigh
of
relief
ay
so
safe
that
father
nicholas
the
french
chaplain
in
his
train
has
been
warned
to
wed
me
to
my
lord
acour
that
is
if
i
m
there
to
and
if
this
acour
is
here
i
ll
seek
him
out
and
challenge
him
eve
and
hugh
laid
hand
upon
his
sword
doubtless
she
replied
sarcastically
sir
edmund
acour
count
of
noyon
seigneur
of
cattrina
will
find
it
honour
to
accept
the
challenge
of
hugh
de
cressi
the
merchant
s
youngest
son
oh
hugh
hugh
are
your
wits
frozen
like
this
winter
marsh
not
thus
can
you
save
the
young
man
thought
a
while
staring
at
the
ground
and
biting
his
lips
then
he
looked
up
suddenly
and
said
how
much
do
you
love
me
eve
with
a
slow
smile
she
opened
her
arms
and
next
moment
they
were
kissing
each
other
as
heartily
as
ever
man
and
maid
have
kissed
since
the
world
began
so
heartily
indeed
that
when
at
length
she
pushed
him
from
her
her
lovely
face
was
as
red
as
the
cloak
she
wore
you
know
well
that
i
love
you
to
my
sorrow
and
undoing
she
said
in
a
broken
voice
from
childhood
it
has
been
so
between
us
and
till
the
grave
takes
one
or
both
it
will
be
so
and
for
my
part
beyond
it
if
the
priests
speak
true
for
whatever
may
be
your
case
i
am
not
one
to
change
my
fancy
when
i
give
i
give
all
though
it
be
of
little
worth
in
truth
hugh
if
i
could
i
would
marry
you
though
you
are
naught
but
a
merchant
s
son
or
even
and
she
paused
wiping
her
eyes
with
the
back
of
her
slim
strong
hand
i
thank
you
he
answered
trembling
with
joy
so
it
is
with
me
for
you
and
no
other
woman
i
live
and
die
and
though
i
am
so
humble
i
ll
be
worthy
of
you
yet
if
god
keeps
me
in
breath
you
shall
not
blush
for
your
man
eve
well
i
am
not
great
at
words
so
let
us
come
to
deeds
will
you
away
with
me
now
i
think
that
father
arnold
would
find
you
lodging
for
the
night
and
an
altar
to
be
wed
at
and
our
ship
sails
for
flanders
and
for
yes
but
would
your
father
give
us
passage
in
it
hugh
why
not
it
could
not
deepen
the
feud
between
our
houses
which
already
has
no
bottom
and
if
he
refused
we
would
take
one
for
the
captain
is
my
friend
and
i
have
some
little
store
set
by
it
came
to
me
from
my
you
ask
much
she
said
all
a
woman
has
my
life
perchance
as
well
yet
there
it
is
i
ll
go
because
i
m
a
fool
hugh
and
as
it
chances
you
are
more
to
me
than
aught
and
i
hate
this
fine
french
lord
i
tell
you
i
sicken
at
his
glance
and
shiver
when
he
touches
me
why
if
he
came
too
near
i
should
murder
him
and
be
hanged
i
ll
go
though
god
alone
knows
the
end
of
our
purpose
being
honest
the
end
will
be
good
eve
though
perhaps
before
all
is
done
we
may
often
think
it
evil
and
now
let
s
away
though
i
wish
that
you
were
dressed
in
another
red
eve
they
name
me
and
red
is
my
badge
because
it
suits
my
dark
face
best
cavil
not
at
my
robe
hugh
for
it
is
the
only
dowry
you
will
get
with
eve
clavering
how
shall
we
go
by
the
walberswick
ferry
you
have
no
nay
but
i
have
a
skiff
hidden
in
the
reeds
five
miles
furlongs
off
we
must
keep
to
the
heath
above
walberswick
for
there
they
might
know
your
red
cloak
even
after
dark
and
i
would
not
have
you
seen
till
we
are
safe
with
sir
arnold
in
the
preceptory
mother
of
heaven
what
is
that
a
peewit
no
more
she
answered
indifferently
nay
it
is
my
man
dick
calling
like
a
peewit
that
is
his
sign
when
trouble
is
afoot
ah
here
he
as
he
spoke
a
tall
gaunt
man
appeared
advancing
towards
them
his
gait
was
a
shambling
trot
that
seemed
slow
although
in
truth
he
was
covering
the
ground
with
extraordinary
swiftness
moreover
he
moved
so
silently
that
even
on
the
soil
his
step
could
not
be
heard
and
so
carefully
that
not
a
reed
stirred
as
he
threaded
in
and
out
among
their
clumps
like
an
otter
his
head
crouched
down
and
his
long
bow
pointed
before
him
as
though
it
were
a
spear
half
a
minute
more
and
he
was
before
them
a
very
strange
man
to
see
his
years
were
not
so
many
thirty
perhaps
and
yet
his
face
looked
quite
old
because
of
its
lack
of
colouring
its
thinness
and
the
hard
lines
that
marked
where
the
muscles
ran
down
to
the
tight
straight
mouth
and
up
to
the
big
forehead
over
which
hung
hair
so
light
that
at
a
little
distance
he
seemed
only
in
this
cold
rocky
face
set
very
far
apart
were
two
eyes
which
just
now
when
he
chose
to
lift
their
lids
that
generally
kept
near
together
as
though
he
were
half
asleep
were
full
of
fire
and
quick
cunning
reaching
the
pair
this
strange
fellow
dropped
to
his
knee
and
raised
his
cap
to
eve
the
great
lady
of
the
claverings
red
eve
as
they
called
her
through
that
then
he
spoke
in
a
low
husky
voice
they
re
coming
master
you
and
your
mistress
must
to
earth
unless
you
mean
to
face
them
in
the
open
and
the
pale
eyes
glittered
as
he
tapped
his
great
black
bow
who
are
coming
dick
be
plain
man
sir
john
clavering
my
lady
s
father
young
john
my
lady
s
brother
the
fine
french
lord
who
wears
a
white
swan
for
a
crest
three
of
the
nights
his
companions
and
six
no
seven
also
from
the
other
side
of
the
grieve
thomas
of
kessland
and
with
him
his
marsh
men
and
and
what
are
they
coming
for
he
asked
again
have
they
hounds
and
hawk
on
wrist
nay
but
they
have
swords
and
knife
on
thigh
and
he
let
his
pale
eyes
fall
on
eve
oh
have
done
she
broke
in
they
come
to
take
me
and
i
ll
not
be
taken
they
come
to
kill
you
and
i
ll
not
see
you
slain
and
live
i
had
words
with
my
father
this
morning
about
the
frenchman
and
i
fear
let
out
the
truth
he
told
me
then
that
ere
the
dunwich
roses
bloomed
again
she
who
loved
you
would
have
naught
but
bones
to
kiss
dick
you
know
the
fen
where
can
we
hide
till
nightfall
follow
me
said
the
man
and
keep
low
plunging
into
the
dense
brake
of
reeds
through
which
he
glided
like
a
polecat
dick
led
them
over
ground
whereon
save
in
times
of
hard
frost
no
man
could
tread
heading
toward
the
river
bank
for
two
hundred
paces
or
more
they
went
thus
till
quite
near
to
the
lip
of
the
stream
they
came
to
a
patch
of
reeds
higher
and
thicker
than
the
rest
in
the
centre
of
which
was
a
little
mound
hid
in
a
tangle
of
scrub
and
rushes
once
perhaps
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
years
before
some
old
marsh
dweller
had
lived
upon
this
mound
or
been
buried
in
it
at
any
rate
on
its
southern
side
hidden
by
reeds
and
a
withered
willow
was
a
cavity
of
which
the
mouth
could
not
be
seen
that
might
have
been
a
chamber
for
the
living
or
the
dead
thrusting
aside
the
growths
that
masked
it
dick
bade
them
enter
and
lie
still
none
will
find
us
here
he
said
as
he
lifted
up
the
reeds
behind
them
unless
they
chance
to
have
hounds
which
i
did
not
see
hist
be
still
they
come
chapter
ii
the
fight
by
the
river
for
a
while
hugh
and
eve
heard
nothing
but
grey
dick
s
ears
were
sharper
than
theirs
quick
as
these
might
be
about
half
a
minute
later
however
they
caught
the
sound
of
horses
hoofs
ringing
on
the
hard
earth
followed
by
that
of
voices
and
the
crackle
of
breaking
reeds
two
of
the
speakers
appeared
and
pulled
up
their
horses
near
by
in
a
dry
hollow
that
lay
between
them
and
the
river
bank
peeping
between
the
reeds
that
grew
about
the
mouth
of
the
eve
saw
them
my
father
and
the
frenchman
she
whispered
look
and
she
slid
back
a
little
so
that
hugh
might
see
peering
through
the
stems
of
the
undergrowth
set
as
it
were
in
a
little
frame
against
the
red
and
ominous
sky
the
eyes
of
hugh
de
cressi
fell
upon
sir
edmund
acour
a
gallant
even
a
knight
that
was
his
first
impression
of
him
broad
shouldered
graceful
in
age
neither
young
nor
old
clean
featured
quick
eyed
with
a
mobile
mouth
and
a
little
beard
soft
and
languid
voiced
black
haired
richly
dressed
in
a
fur
robe
and
mounted
on
a
fine
black
horse
such
was
the
man
staring
at
acour
and
remembering
that
he
too
loved
red
eve
hugh
grew
suddenly
ashamed
how
could
a
mere
merchant
compare
himself
with
this
magnificent
lord
this
favourite
of
courts
and
of
fortune
how
could
he
rival
him
he
who
had
never
yet
travelled
a
hundred
miles
from
the
place
where
he
was
born
save
once
when
he
sailed
on
a
trading
voyage
to
calais
as
well
might
a
hooded
crow
try
to
match
a
peregrine
that
swooped
to
snatch
away
the
dove
from
beneath
its
claws
yes
he
hugh
was
the
grey
crow
eve
was
the
dove
whom
he
had
captured
and
yonder
count
was
the
fleet
fierce
peregrine
who
soon
would
tear
out
his
heart
and
bear
the
quarry
far
away
hugh
shivered
a
little
as
the
thought
struck
him
not
with
fear
for
himself
but
at
the
dread
of
that
great
and
close
bereavement
the
girl
at
his
side
felt
the
shiver
and
her
mind
quickened
by
love
and
peril
guessed
its
purport
she
said
nothing
for
words
were
dangerous
only
turning
her
beautiful
face
she
pressed
her
lips
upon
her
lover
s
hand
it
was
her
message
to
him
thereby
as
he
knew
well
humble
as
he
might
be
she
acknowledged
him
her
lord
forever
i
am
with
you
said
that
kiss
have
no
fear
in
life
or
in
death
none
shall
divide
us
he
looked
at
her
with
grateful
eyes
and
would
have
spoken
had
she
not
placed
her
hand
upon
his
mouth
and
pointed
acour
was
speaking
in
english
which
he
used
with
a
strong
french
accent
well
we
do
not
find
your
beautiful
runaway
sir
john
he
said
in
a
clear
and
cultivated
voice
and
although
i
am
not
vain
for
my
part
i
can
not
believe
that
she
has
come
to
such
a
place
as
this
to
meet
a
merchant
s
clerk
she
who
should
company
with
yet
i
fear
it
is
so
sir
edmund
answered
sir
john
clavering
a
stout
dark
man
of
middle
age
this
girl
of
mine
is
very
heady
as
i
give
warning
you
will
find
out
when
she
is
your
wife
for
years
she
has
set
her
fancy
upon
hugh
de
cressi
yes
since
they
were
boy
and
girl
together
as
i
think
and
while
he
lives
i
doubt
she
ll
never
change
while
he
lives
then
why
should
he
continue
to
live
sir
john
asked
the
count
indifferently
surely
the
world
will
not
miss
a
chapman
s
son
the
de
cressis
are
my
kin
although
i
hate
them
sir
edmund
also
they
are
rich
and
powerful
and
have
many
friends
in
high
places
if
this
young
man
died
by
my
command
it
would
start
a
blood
feud
of
which
none
can
tell
the
end
for
after
all
he
is
nobly
then
sir
john
he
shall
die
by
mine
no
not
at
my
own
hands
since
i
do
not
fight
with
traders
but
i
have
those
about
me
who
are
pretty
swordsmen
and
know
how
to
pick
a
quarrel
before
a
week
is
out
there
will
be
a
funeral
in
i
know
nothing
of
your
men
and
do
not
want
to
hear
of
their
quarrels
past
or
future
said
sir
john
testily
of
course
not
answered
the
count
i
pray
you
forget
my
words
name
of
god
what
an
accursed
and
spot
is
this
i
feel
as
though
i
were
standing
by
my
own
grave
it
came
upon
me
and
he
shivered
and
turned
pale
dick
lifted
his
bow
but
hugh
knocked
the
arrow
aside
ere
he
could
loose
it
to
those
who
talk
of
death
death
often
draws
near
replied
clavering
crossing
himself
though
i
find
the
place
well
enough
seeing
the
hour
and
do
you
do
you
sir
john
look
at
that
sky
look
at
the
river
beneath
which
has
turned
to
blood
hark
to
the
howl
of
the
wind
in
the
reeds
and
the
cry
of
the
birds
we
can
not
see
ay
and
look
at
our
shadows
on
the
snow
mine
lies
flat
by
a
great
hole
and
yours
rising
against
yonder
bank
is
that
of
a
hooded
man
with
hollow
eyes
death
himself
as
i
should
limn
him
there
it
is
gone
what
a
fool
am
i
or
how
strong
is
that
wine
of
yours
shall
we
be
going
also
nay
here
comes
my
son
with
tidings
well
jack
have
you
found
your
sister
he
added
addressing
a
dark
and
somewhat
saturnine
young
man
who
now
rode
up
to
them
from
over
the
crest
of
the
hollow
no
sir
though
we
have
beat
the
marsh
through
and
through
so
that
scarce
an
otter
could
have
escaped
us
and
yet
she
s
here
for
thomas
of
kessland
caught
sight
of
her
red
cloak
among
the
reeds
and
what
s
more
hugh
de
cressi
is
with
her
and
grey
dick
too
for
both
were
i
am
glad
there
s
a
third
said
sir
john
drily
though
god
save
me
from
his
arrows
this
grey
dick
he
added
to
the
count
is
a
wild
homeless
whom
they
call
hugh
de
cressi
s
shadow
but
the
finest
archer
in
suffolk
with
norfolk
thrown
in
one
who
can
put
a
shaft
through
every
button
on
your
doublet
at
fifty
paces
ay
and
bring
down
wild
geese
on
the
wing
twice
out
of
four
times
for
i
have
seen
him
do
it
with
that
black
bow
of
indeed
then
i
should
like
to
see
him
shoot
at
somebody
else
answered
acour
for
in
those
days
such
skill
was
of
interest
to
all
soldiers
kill
hugh
de
cressi
if
you
will
friend
but
spare
grey
dick
he
might
be
ay
sir
edmund
broke
in
the
young
man
furiously
i
ll
kill
him
if
i
can
catch
him
the
dog
who
dares
to
bring
scandal
on
my
sister
s
name
let
the
saints
but
give
me
five
minutes
face
to
face
with
him
alone
with
none
to
help
either
of
us
and
i
ll
beat
him
to
a
pulp
and
hang
what
s
left
of
him
upon
the
nearest
tree
to
be
a
warning
to
all
such
i
note
the
challenge
said
sir
edmund
and
should
the
chance
come
my
way
will
keep
the
lists
for
you
with
pleasure
since
whatever
this
hugh
may
be
i
doubt
that
from
his
blood
he
ll
prove
no
coward
but
young
sir
you
must
catch
your
puppy
ere
you
hang
him
and
if
he
is
in
this
marsh
he
must
have
gone
to
i
think
so
too
sir
edmund
but
if
so
we
ll
soon
start
the
badger
look
and
he
pointed
to
smoke
rising
at
several
spots
half
a
mile
or
more
away
what
have
you
done
son
asked
sir
john
anxiously
fired
the
reeds
he
said
with
a
savage
laugh
and
set
men
to
watch
that
the
game
does
not
break
back
oh
have
no
fear
father
red
eve
will
take
no
harm
the
girl
ever
loved
fire
moreover
if
she
is
there
she
will
run
to
the
water
before
it
and
be
fool
thundered
sir
john
do
you
know
your
sister
so
little
as
like
as
not
she
ll
stay
and
burn
and
then
i
ll
lose
my
girl
who
when
all
is
said
is
worth
ten
of
you
well
what
is
done
can
not
be
undone
but
if
death
comes
of
this
mad
trick
it
is
on
your
head
not
mine
to
the
bank
and
watch
with
me
sir
edmund
for
we
can
do
no
ten
minutes
later
and
the
fugitives
in
the
mound
peeping
out
from
their
hole
saw
clouds
of
smoke
floating
above
them
you
should
have
let
me
shoot
master
hugh
said
grey
dick
in
his
hard
dry
whisper
i
d
have
had
these
three
at
least
and
they
d
have
been
good
company
on
the
road
to
hell
which
now
we
must
walk
nay
answered
hugh
sternly
i
ll
murder
none
though
they
strive
to
murder
us
and
these
least
of
all
and
he
glanced
at
eve
who
sat
staring
out
of
the
mouth
of
the
hole
her
chin
resting
on
her
hand
you
had
best
give
in
sweetheart
he
said
hoarsely
fire
is
worse
than
foes
and
it
draws
i
fear
it
less
she
answered
moreover
marriage
is
worse
than
either
hugh
took
counsel
with
grey
dick
this
place
will
burn
like
tinder
he
said
pointing
to
the
dry
reeds
which
grew
thickly
all
about
them
and
to
the
masses
of
brushwood
and
other
rubbish
that
had
drifted
against
the
side
of
the
little
mound
in
times
of
flood
if
the
fire
reaches
us
we
must
perish
of
flame
or
smoke
or
ay
answered
dick
like
old
witch
sarah
when
they
burned
her
in
her
house
she
screeched
a
lot
though
some
say
it
was
her
cat
that
screeched
and
she
died
if
we
could
get
into
the
water
now
dick
he
shook
his
head
the
pools
are
frozen
moreover
as
well
die
of
heat
as
cold
i
love
not
what
counsel
then
dick
you
ll
not
take
the
best
master
to
loose
my
bow
upon
them
that
fine
fellow
did
well
to
be
afraid
for
had
you
not
knocked
up
my
hand
there
d
be
an
arrow
sticking
in
his
throat
by
now
he
was
right
death
walked
near
to
it
must
not
be
dick
unless
they
strike
first
what
else
perchance
when
the
smoke
begins
to
trouble
them
which
it
must
soon
they
ll
move
then
we
will
run
for
the
river
tis
but
fifty
yards
the
lady
eve
can
swim
like
a
duck
and
so
can
you
the
tide
has
turned
and
will
bear
you
to
the
point
and
i
ll
hold
the
bank
against
any
who
try
to
follow
and
take
my
chance
what
say
you
of
that
plan
lady
that
it
is
good
as
another
or
as
bad
she
answered
indifferently
let
s
bide
where
we
are
and
do
what
we
must
when
we
must
nay
waste
no
more
breath
hugh
i
ll
not
yield
and
go
home
like
a
naughty
child
to
be
married
it
was
you
who
snatched
away
grey
dick
s
shaft
not
i
and
now
i
ll
save
red
eve
that
s
red
eve
muttered
the
henchman
with
a
dry
chuckle
of
admiration
the
dead
trouble
neither
man
nor
woman
ah
she
knows
she
knows
after
this
there
was
silence
for
a
while
save
for
the
roar
of
the
fire
that
ever
drew
more
near
eve
held
her
cloak
pressed
against
her
mouth
to
filter
the
smoke
which
grew
thick
it
is
time
to
move
said
hugh
coughing
as
he
spoke
by
heaven
s
grace
we
are
too
late
look
as
he
spoke
suddenly
in
the
broad
belt
of
reeds
which
lay
between
them
and
the
river
bank
fire
appeared
in
several
places
caused
doubtless
by
the
flaming
flakes
which
the
strong
wind
had
carried
from
behind
the
mound
moreover
these
new
fires
burning
up
briskly
and
joining
themselves
together
began
to
advance
toward
the
three
in
the
hole
the
wind
has
turned
said
dick
now
it
is
fire
or
water
if
you
can
get
there
how
do
you
choose
to
die
and
as
he
spoke
he
unstrung
his
bow
and
slipped
it
into
its
leathern
case
neither
one
way
nor
the
other
answered
eve
some
may
die
but
we
shall
hugh
leapt
up
and
took
command
cover
your
faces
to
the
eyes
and
run
for
it
he
said
i
ll
go
first
then
you
eve
and
dick
behind
make
for
the
point
and
leap
the
water
is
deep
they
sprang
to
their
feet
and
forward
into
the
reeds
when
they
were
almost
at
the
edge
of
the
fire
a
shout
told
them
that
they
had
been
seen
eve
the
swift
of
foot
outpaced
hugh
and
was
the
first
to
leap
into
that
circle
of
tall
flames
she
was
through
it
they
were
all
through
it
scorched
but
unharmed
thirty
paces
away
was
the
little
point
of
land
where
nothing
grew
for
the
spring
tides
washed
it
that
jutted
out
into
the
waters
of
the
blythe
and
perhaps
a
hundred
to
their
right
the
claverings
poured
down
on
them
foot
and
horse
together
hugh
caught
his
foot
in
a
willow
root
and
fell
eve
and
grey
dick
sped
onward
unknowing
they
reached
the
point
above
the
water
turned
and
saw
dick
slipped
his
bow
from
its
case
strung
it
and
set
an
arrow
on
the
string
hugh
had
gained
his
feet
but
a
man
who
had
come
up
sprang
and
cast
his
arms
about
him
hugh
threw
him
to
the
ground
for
he
was
very
strong
and
shook
himself
free
then
he
drew
the
short
and
heavy
sword
that
he
wore
and
shouting
out
make
way
to
those
who
stood
between
him
and
the
little
promontory
started
to
run
again
these
opened
to
the
right
and
left
to
let
him
pass
for
they
feared
the
look
in
his
eyes
and
the
steel
in
his
hand
only
young
john
clavering
who
had
leapt
from
his
horse
would
not
budge
as
hugh
tried
to
push
past
him
he
struck
him
in
the
face
calling
out
we
have
caught
the
de
cressi
thief
take
him
and
hang
him
at
the
insult
of
the
blow
and
words
hugh
stopped
dead
and
turned
quite
white
whereupon
the
men
thinking
that
he
was
afraid
closed
in
upon
him
then
in
the
silence
the
harsh
croaking
voice
of
grey
dick
was
heard
saying
sir
john
of
clavering
bid
your
people
let
my
master
go
or
i
will
send
an
arrow
through
your
heart
and
he
lifted
the
long
bow
and
drew
it
sir
john
muttered
something
thinking
that
this
was
a
poor
way
to
die
and
again
the
men
fell
back
except
one
french
knight
who
perhaps
did
not
catch
or
understand
his
words
this
man
stretched
out
his
hand
to
seize
hugh
but
before
ever
it
fell
upon
his
shoulder
the
bow
twanged
and
acour
s
retainer
was
seen
whirling
round
and
round
cursing
with
pain
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
was
an
arrow
that
had
sunk
through
it
to
the
feathers
you
are
right
that
knave
shoots
well
said
the
count
to
sir
john
who
made
no
answer
now
again
all
fell
back
so
that
hugh
might
have
run
for
it
if
he
would
but
his
blood
was
up
and
he
did
not
stir
john
clavering
he
said
addressing
the
young
man
just
now
when
i
lay
hid
in
yonder
hole
i
heard
you
say
that
if
you
had
five
minutes
with
me
alone
you
d
beat
me
to
a
pulp
and
hang
what
was
left
of
me
on
the
nearest
tree
well
here
i
stand
and
there
s
a
tree
having
first
tried
to
burn
me
and
your
sister
you
have
struck
me
in
the
face
will
you
make
good
your
words
or
shall
i
strike
in
the
face
and
go
my
way
nay
keep
your
dogs
off
me
grey
dick
yonder
has
more
now
a
tumult
rose
some
saying
one
thing
and
some
another
but
all
keeping
an
eye
upon
grey
dick
and
his
bent
bow
at
last
sir
edmund
acour
rode
forward
and
in
his
polished
stately
way
said
to
john
young
sir
this
merchant
is
in
the
right
and
whatever
his
trade
may
be
his
blood
is
as
good
as
your
own
after
your
brave
words
either
you
should
fight
him
or
take
back
the
blow
you
then
he
leaned
down
and
whispered
into
john
s
ear
your
sword
is
longer
than
his
make
an
end
of
him
and
of
all
his
trouble
lest
men
should
laugh
at
you
as
an
empty
now
john
who
was
brave
and
needed
but
little
urging
turned
to
his
father
and
said
have
i
your
leave
to
whip
this
fellow
sir
you
should
have
asked
that
before
you
struck
him
in
the
face
replied
the
knight
you
are
a
man
grown
do
as
best
pleases
you
only
if
you
take
the
blow
begone
from
then
eve
who
all
this
time
had
been
listening
called
out
from
where
she
stood
above
the
river
brother
john
if
you
fight
your
cousin
hugh
who
is
my
affianced
husband
and
fall
on
your
own
head
be
it
for
know
your
blood
shall
not
stand
between
him
and
me
since
it
was
you
who
struck
him
and
not
he
you
be
warned
john
and
let
him
go
lest
he
should
send
you
farther
than
you
wish
to
travel
and
to
you
hugh
i
say
though
it
is
much
to
ask
if
he
throws
down
his
sword
forget
that
unknightly
blow
and
come
you
hear
said
hugh
shortly
to
john
now
because
she
is
your
sister
if
it
s
your
will
i
ll
begone
in
ay
answered
john
setting
his
thin
lips
because
you
are
a
coward
and
seek
to
live
that
you
may
bring
shame
upon
our
house
well
that
will
pass
when
you
die
presently
john
john
boast
not
cried
eve
who
has
shown
you
where
you
will
sleep
whether
i
shall
live
or
die
god
knows
alone
said
hugh
solemnly
but
what
i
seek
to
know
is
should
it
chance
to
be
your
lot
to
die
whether
your
people
or
this
frenchman
will
set
on
me
or
raise
a
against
me
tell
me
now
sir
john
if
you
kill
my
son
in
combat
he
being
the
challenger
answered
the
knight
none
shall
lift
hand
against
you
for
that
deed
if
i
can
hold
them
back
but
know
that
i
have
other
cause
of
quarrel
against
you
and
he
pointed
to
his
daughter
and
that
if
you
meddle
more
with
her
who
is
not
for
you
certainly
you
shall
and
young
sir
broke
in
sir
edmund
i
pray
you
to
understand
that
this
lady
eve
becomes
my
wife
with
the
will
of
her
father
and
her
kin
and
that
if
you
try
to
stand
between
us
although
i
may
not
fight
you
seeing
what
i
am
and
what
you
are
i
ll
kill
you
like
a
rat
when
and
where
i
get
the
chance
yes
he
added
in
a
savage
snarl
i
pledge
my
knightly
honour
that
i
will
kill
you
like
a
rat
if
i
must
follow
you
across
the
world
to
do
so
you
will
not
have
need
to
travel
far
if
i
have
my
will
answered
the
young
man
sternly
since
red
eve
is
mine
not
yours
and
living
or
dead
mine
she
will
remain
as
for
your
fine
knightly
honour
sir
edmund
acour
count
de
noyon
seigneur
of
cattrina
what
has
a
traitor
to
his
king
to
do
with
honour
one
who
is
here
as
a
spy
of
philip
of
france
as
the
poor
merchant
s
lad
knows
well
oh
take
you
hand
from
your
sword
of
which
you
say
i
am
not
worthy
and
since
you
say
also
that
i
have
so
many
enemies
let
me
begin
with
a
squire
of
my
own
now
at
these
bold
words
arose
a
clamour
of
voices
speaking
in
french
and
english
what
say
you
to
this
sir
edmund
shouted
sir
john
clavering
above
them
all
you
are
a
great
lord
and
a
wealthy
beloved
by
me
also
as
the
affianced
of
my
daughter
but
i
am
a
loyal
englishman
who
have
no
truck
with
traitors
to
my
what
say
i
asked
sir
edmund
calmly
i
say
that
if
this
fellow
can
fight
as
well
as
he
can
lie
your
son
has
but
a
poor
chance
with
him
as
you
know
well
i
came
hither
from
france
to
visit
my
estates
not
to
learn
what
strength
his
grace
of
england
my
liege
lord
gathers
for
the
new
war
with
enough
said
sir
john
though
this
is
the
first
i
have
heard
of
such
a
war
for
it
would
seem
that
you
know
more
of
king
edward
s
mind
than
i
do
the
light
begins
to
fail
there
is
no
time
for
talk
stand
clear
all
men
and
let
these
two
settle
ay
croaked
grey
dick
stand
clear
all
men
while
my
master
cuts
the
throat
of
his
cousin
clavering
since
he
who
stands
not
clear
shall
presently
lie
straight
and
he
tapped
his
terrible
bow
with
his
right
hand
then
instantly
seized
the
string
again
the
two
were
face
to
face
round
them
on
horse
and
on
foot
at
a
distance
perhaps
of
twenty
paces
were
gathered
the
clavering
men
and
the
french
count
s
troop
for
now
all
had
come
up
from
the
far
parts
of
the
marsh
only
toward
the
river
side
the
ring
was
open
whether
because
those
who
made
it
feared
grey
dick
s
arrows
or
in
order
that
he
and
red
eve
might
see
everything
that
chanced
the
pair
were
well
matched
for
though
hugh
was
the
taller
john
his
senior
by
a
year
was
thicker
set
and
better
trained
in
arms
but
the
sword
of
john
was
longer
by
a
hand
s
breadth
than
that
hugh
carried
as
a
merchant
which
was
heavy
of
such
a
make
as
the
ancient
romans
used
and
sharpened
on
either
edge
neither
of
them
wore
armour
since
hugh
had
no
right
to
do
so
and
john
had
not
come
out
to
fight
they
stood
still
for
a
moment
in
the
midst
of
a
breathless
silence
the
red
light
of
the
stormy
sunset
striking
across
them
both
everything
was
red
the
rising
from
the
sullen
burning
marsh
into
which
the
fire
was
still
eating
far
away
the
waters
of
the
blythe
brimful
with
the
tide
that
had
just
turned
toward
the
sea
the
snow
and
ice
itself
even
the
triangle
of
wild
swans
brought
by
the
hard
weather
from
the
northern
lands
looked
red
as
they
pursued
their
heavy
and
majestic
flight
toward
the
south
heedless
of
man
and
his
affairs
beneath
not
long
did
these
remain
heedless
however
since
either
to
show
his
skill
or
for
some
other
purpose
of
his
own
grey
dick
lifted
his
bow
and
loosed
an
arrow
almost
it
seemed
at
hazard
yet
that
arrow
pierced
the
leader
of
the
flock
so
that
down
it
came
in
wide
circles
and
in
a
last
struggle
hovered
for
a
moment
over
the
group
of
men
then
fell
among
them
with
a
thud
the
blood
from
its
pierced
breast
bespattering
sir
edmund
acour
and
john
clavering
s
black
hair
an
ill
omen
for
those
two
and
especially
for
him
who
wears
a
white
swan
for
a
crest
said
a
voice
but
at
the
moment
none
took
much
notice
except
grey
dick
who
chuckled
at
the
success
of
his
shot
since
all
were
intent
on
greater
matters
namely
which
of
those
two
young
men
should
die
sir
john
the
father
rode
forward
and
addressed
them
to
the
death
without
mercy
to
the
fallen
he
said
grimly
they
bent
their
heads
in
answer
now
he
cried
and
reined
back
his
horse
the
first
home
thrust
wins
whispered
acour
to
him
as
he
wiped
the
blood
of
the
swan
off
his
sleeve
thank
god
your
son
s
sword
is
the
longer
perhaps
the
pair
heard
this
whisper
or
perhaps
being
without
mail
they
knew
that
it
was
so
at
least
for
a
while
they
circled
round
and
round
each
other
but
out
of
reach
then
at
length
john
clavering
rushed
in
and
thrust
hugh
sprang
back
before
his
point
again
he
rushed
and
thrust
and
again
hugh
sprang
back
a
third
time
and
hugh
fairly
ran
whereon
a
shout
went
up
from
the
claverings
the
chapman
s
afraid
cried
one
give
him
a
yard
measure
shouted
another
he
can
not
handle
steel
eve
turned
her
face
and
her
very
eyes
were
sick
with
doubt
is
it
true
she
gasped
ay
answered
dick
the
archer
it
s
true
that
he
draws
him
to
the
river
bank
those
who
wait
will
learn
why
oh
the
swan
he
sees
not
the
swan
as
he
spoke
hugh
in
his
retreat
before
another
of
john
clavering
s
rushes
struck
his
foot
against
the
great
dead
bird
and
staggered
john
leapt
upon
him
and
he
went
down
is
he
pierced
muttered
eve
nay
missed
answered
dick
by
half
an
inch
ah
i
thought
so
as
the
words
left
his
lips
clavering
fell
sprawling
on
his
back
for
hugh
had
caught
his
leg
with
his
left
arm
and
thrown
him
so
that
they
lay
both
together
on
the
ground
there
they
closed
rolling
over
each
other
but
too
close
to
stab
now
john
said
dick
with
his
hoarse
chuckle
throat
him
master
throat
him
the
flurry
in
the
snow
was
at
an
end
john
lay
on
his
back
de
cressi
knelt
on
him
and
lifted
his
short
sword
do
you
yield
men
heard
him
say
nay
answered
clavering
then
suddenly
hugh
rose
and
suffered
his
adversary
to
do
likewise
i
ll
not
stick
you
like
a
hog
he
said
and
some
cried
well
done
for
the
act
seemed
noble
only
acour
muttered
fool
next
instant
they
were
at
it
again
but
this
time
it
was
hugh
who
attacked
and
john
who
gave
back
right
to
the
river
s
edge
for
skill
and
courage
seemed
to
fail
him
at
once
turn
your
head
lady
said
dick
for
now
one
must
but
eve
could
not
the
swords
flashed
for
the
last
time
in
the
red
light
then
that
of
de
cressi
vanished
clavering
threw
his
arms
wide
and
fell
backward
a
splash
as
of
a
great
stone
thrown
into
water
and
all
was
done
hugh
stood
a
moment
on
the
river
s
bank
staring
at
the
stream
beneath
then
he
turned
and
began
to
walk
slowly
toward
the
dead
swan
ere
ever
he
reached
it
sir
john
clavering
fell
from
his
horse
in
a
swoon
and
a
shout
of
rage
went
up
from
all
his
people
kill
him
they
yelled
and
leapt
forward
now
hugh
understood
and
ran
for
the
point
of
land
one
man
a
frenchman
got
in
front
of
him
he
cut
him
down
and
sped
on
what
now
said
eve
as
he
joined
them
he
did
not
answer
only
pointed
first
to
the
clavering
folk
and
next
to
the
water
showing
that
she
must
choose
between
the
two
swim
for
it
growled
grey
dick
i
ll
hold
them
back
a
while
and
then
join
you
and
as
he
spoke
his
bow
twanged
for
an
instant
eve
paused
then
threw
off
her
scarlet
cloak
remember
i
slew
your
brother
said
hugh
hoarsely
i
remember
that
he
would
have
slain
you
she
answered
and
leapt
straight
from
the
point
into
the
icy
flood
beneath
which
her
head
sank
when
it
rose
again
there
was
another
head
beside
it
that
of
dead
john
who
appeared
for
one
moment
to
be
seen
no
more
for
ever
since
ere
morning
the
ocean
had
him
now
hugh
leapt
after
her
and
presently
the
pair
of
them
were
swimming
side
by
side
to
the
river
s
further
shore
then
as
now
it
was
but
a
narrow
stream
yet
they
did
not
reach
it
easily
for
cumbered
as
they
were
with
clothes
and
numbed
by
the
water
the
fierce
tide
caught
them
and
carried
them
beyond
the
bend
there
they
were
lost
in
the
gathering
darkness
so
that
most
of
those
who
watched
believed
that
they
had
sunk
and
drowned
but
it
was
not
so
for
after
a
long
struggle
they
came
safe
to
shore
near
to
a
clump
of
willows
and
clambered
over
the
frozen
mud
to
the
heath
beyond
first
fire
then
water
said
hugh
in
a
mazed
voice
you
have
missed
out
love
and
death
answered
the
girl
a
full
feast
for
a
day
that
is
not
done
but
whither
now
to
take
sanctuary
at
the
preceptory
and
raise
my
kin
forward
eve
ere
you
i
think
there
is
that
in
me
which
will
not
freeze
she
answered
and
broke
into
a
run
now
night
closed
in
and
the
snow
which
had
been
threatening
all
day
began
to
fall
making
their
path
over
the
heath
difficult
we
need
grey
dick
to
guide
us
but
alack
i
fear
he
is
dead
muttered
hugh
i
think
others
will
be
dead
not
dick
she
answered
just
then
they
heard
a
footstep
behind
them
hugh
wheeled
round
and
drew
his
sword
but
almost
before
it
had
left
the
scabbard
a
long
figure
glided
out
of
the
snow
and
said
more
to
the
left
master
more
to
the
left
unless
you
would
make
your
peace
on
blythburgh
bridge
where
some
would
be
glad
to
meet
how
went
it
asked
hugh
shortly
not
well
i
shot
thrice
and
slew
three
men
two
of
the
french
knights
and
thomas
of
kessland
against
whom
i
had
a
score
that
now
is
settled
but
the
fourth
time
i
who
asked
eve
between
her
teeth
as
she
ran
beside
him
the
frenchman
who
means
to
marry
you
when
the
others
fell
back
he
came
at
me
on
his
horse
as
i
was
setting
a
fresh
arrow
thinking
to
get
me
i
had
to
shoot
quick
and
aimed
low
for
his
heart
because
in
that
light
i
could
not
make
certain
of
his
face
he
saw
and
jerked
up
the
horses
head
so
that
the
shaft
took
it
in
the
throat
and
killed
the
beast
without
hurting
its
rider
he
was
off
in
an
instant
and
at
me
with
others
before
i
could
draw
again
so
i
thought
it
time
to
go
which
i
did
backward
as
he
thrust
perhaps
he
thinks
he
killed
me
as
i
meant
he
should
only
when
he
looks
at
his
sword
he
ll
find
it
clean
that
s
and
again
grey
dick
chuckled
chapter
iii
father
andrew
none
were
abroad
in
the
streets
of
dunwich
on
that
bitter
winter
night
when
these
three
trudged
wearily
down
middlegate
street
through
the
driving
snow
to
the
door
of
the
grey
preceptory
of
the
knights
templar
in
a
window
above
the
porch
a
light
burned
dimly
the
only
one
to
be
seen
in
any
of
the
houses
round
about
for
by
now
all
men
were
abed
tis
father
arnold
s
room
said
eve
he
sits
there
at
his
books
i
ll
knock
and
call
him
but
do
you
two
go
lay
hold
of
the
ring
of
the
church
door
and
she
nodded
toward
a
grey
pile
that
stood
near
by
then
none
can
touch
you
and
how
know
we
who
may
be
in
this
house
i
ll
go
no
step
further
answered
hugh
sullenly
all
this
temple
ground
is
sanctuary
or
at
least
we
will
risk
and
seizing
the
knocker
he
hammered
at
the
door
the
light
in
the
window
vanished
and
presently
they
heard
a
sound
of
creaking
bolts
then
the
door
opened
revealing
a
tall
man
ancient
and
clad
in
a
frayed
furred
robe
worn
over
a
priest
s
cassock
who
held
a
lantern
in
his
hand
who
knocks
he
asked
does
some
soul
pass
that
you
disturb
me
after
curfew
ay
father
andrew
answered
hugh
souls
have
passed
and
souls
are
near
to
passing
let
us
in
and
we
will
tell
you
without
waiting
for
an
answer
he
entered
with
the
others
pushed
to
the
massive
door
and
bolted
it
again
what
s
this
a
woman
said
the
old
priest
eve
of
clavering
by
the
saints
yes
she
answered
calmly
though
her
teeth
chattered
eve
of
clavering
eve
the
red
this
time
with
the
blood
of
men
soaked
with
the
waters
of
the
blythe
frozen
with
the
snows
of
dunwich
heath
where
she
has
lain
hid
for
hours
with
a
furze
bush
for
shelter
eve
who
seeks
shriving
a
dry
rag
for
her
back
a
morsel
for
her
lips
and
fire
to
warm
her
which
in
the
name
of
christ
and
of
charity
she
prays
you
will
not
refuse
to
so
she
spoke
and
laughed
recklessly
almost
before
she
had
finished
her
wild
words
the
old
man
who
looked
what
he
was
a
knight
arrayed
in
priestly
robes
had
run
to
a
door
at
the
end
of
the
hall
and
was
calling
through
it
mother
agnes
mother
agnes
be
not
so
hasty
sir
andrew
answered
a
shrill
voice
a
posset
must
have
time
to
boil
it
is
meet
now
that
you
wear
a
tonsure
that
you
who
are
no
longer
a
centurion
should
forget
these
come
and
he
cometh
ways
when
the
water
s
hot
the
rest
of
that
speech
was
lost
for
father
arnold
muttering
some
word
belonging
to
his
centurion
days
dived
into
the
kitchen
to
reappear
presently
dragging
a
little
withered
old
woman
after
him
who
was
dressed
in
a
robe
of
conventual
make
peace
mother
agnes
peace
he
said
take
this
lady
dry
her
array
her
in
your
best
gown
give
her
food
warm
her
and
bring
her
back
to
me
short
what
care
i
if
the
robe
be
short
obey
or
it
will
not
be
come
and
he
cometh
but
go
and
she
goeth
and
then
who
will
shelter
one
who
talks
so
much
he
thrust
the
pair
of
them
through
the
kitchen
door
and
returning
led
hugh
and
grey
dick
up
a
broad
oak
stair
to
what
had
been
the
of
the
preceptory
on
its
first
floor
it
was
a
very
great
chamber
where
before
their
order
was
dispersed
all
the
knights
templar
had
been
wont
to
dine
with
those
who
visited
them
at
times
of
festival
tattered
banners
still
hung
among
the
cobwebs
of
the
ancient
roof
the
shields
of
past
masters
with
stately
blazonings
were
carved
in
stone
upon
the
walls
but
of
all
this
departed
splendour
but
little
could
be
seen
since
the
place
was
lit
only
by
a
single
lamp
of
whale
s
oil
and
a
fire
that
burned
upon
the
wide
stone
hearth
a
great
fire
since
father
arnold
who
had
spent
many
years
of
his
life
in
the
east
loved
warmth
now
hugh
de
cressi
he
said
what
have
you
done
slain
my
cousin
john
of
clavering
father
and
perhaps
another
in
fair
fight
very
fair
fight
croaked
grey
dick
who
doubts
it
can
a
de
cressi
be
a
murderer
asked
the
priest
and
you
richard
the
archer
what
have
you
done
shot
a
good
horse
and
three
bad
men
dead
with
arrows
at
least
they
should
be
dead
and
another
through
the
hand
standing
one
against
a
gallant
i
mean
an
evil
deed
broke
in
the
old
warrior
priest
though
once
it
happened
to
me
in
a
place
called
damascus
but
you
both
are
wet
also
come
into
my
chamber
i
can
furnish
you
with
garments
of
a
sort
and
richard
set
that
black
bow
of
yours
near
the
fire
but
not
too
fire
as
you
should
know
well
a
damp
string
is
ill
to
draw
with
nay
fear
not
to
leave
it
this
is
sanctuary
and
to
make
sure
i
will
lock
the
half
an
hour
was
gone
by
and
a
very
strange
company
had
gathered
round
the
big
fire
in
the
of
the
temple
eating
with
appetite
of
such
food
as
its
scanty
larder
could
provide
for
them
first
there
was
red
eve
in
a
woollen
garment
the
sunday
wear
of
mother
agnes
for
twenty
years
past
and
more
which
reached
but
little
below
her
knees
and
was
shaped
like
a
sack
on
her
feet
were
no
shoes
and
for
sole
adornment
her
curling
black
hair
fell
about
her
shoulders
for
so
she
had
arranged
it
because
the
gown
would
not
meet
across
her
bosom
yet
odd
as
it
might
be
in
this
costume
eve
looked
wonderfully
beautiful
perhaps
because
it
was
so
scant
and
the
leathern
strap
about
her
waist
caused
it
to
cling
close
to
her
shapely
form
by
her
stood
hugh
wearing
a
splendid
suit
of
chain
armour
it
had
been
sir
andrew
arnold
s
in
his
warlike
years
and
now
he
lent
it
to
his
godson
hugh
because
as
he
said
he
had
nothing
else
also
it
may
have
crossed
the
minds
of
both
of
them
that
such
mail
as
this
which
the
saracens
had
forged
if
somewhat
out
of
fashion
could
still
turn
swordcuts
then
there
was
grey
dick
whose
garments
seemed
to
consist
of
a
sack
with
holes
in
it
tied
round
him
with
a
rope
his
quiver
of
arrows
slung
over
it
for
ornament
he
sat
by
the
fire
on
a
stool
oiling
his
black
bow
with
a
rind
of
the
fat
bacon
that
he
had
been
eating
all
the
tale
had
been
told
and
father
arnold
looked
very
grave
indeed
i
have
known
strange
and
dreadful
stories
in
my
time
he
said
but
never
i
think
one
stranger
or
more
dreadful
what
would
you
do
now
godson
take
sanctuary
for
myself
and
grey
dick
because
of
the
slaying
of
john
clavering
and
others
and
afterward
be
married
by
you
to
be
married
to
the
sister
with
the
brother
s
blood
upon
your
hands
without
absolution
from
the
church
or
pardon
from
the
king
and
you
but
a
merchant
s
younger
son
and
she
one
of
the
greatest
heiresses
in
east
anglia
why
how
may
that
be
i
blame
him
not
broke
in
eve
john
whom
i
never
loved
strove
to
smoke
us
out
like
rats
because
he
was
in
the
pay
of
the
norman
my
lord
of
acour
john
struck
hugh
in
the
face
with
his
hand
and
slandered
him
with
his
tongue
john
was
given
his
life
once
and
afterwards
slain
in
fair
fight
oh
i
say
i
blame
him
not
nor
shall
john
s
blood
rise
between
him
and
me
yet
the
world
will
blame
him
and
you
too
eve
yes
even
those
who
love
you
both
a
while
must
go
by
say
a
year
at
least
i
ll
not
marry
you
at
once
and
can
not
if
i
would
with
both
your
fathers
living
and
unadvised
and
the
sheriff
waiting
at
the
gate
tell
me
now
do
any
know
that
you
have
entered
here
nay
said
dick
looking
up
from
his
bow
the
hunt
came
after
us
but
i
hid
these
two
in
a
bush
and
led
it
away
past
hinton
to
the
ipswich
road
keeping
but
just
ahead
in
the
snow
and
talking
in
three
voices
then
i
gave
them
the
slip
and
returned
they
ll
not
guess
that
we
have
come
to
dunwich
for
a
and
when
they
do
even
the
boldest
will
not
enter
this
holy
sanctuary
while
the
church
has
terrors
for
men
s
souls
yet
here
you
must
not
stay
for
long
lest
in
this
way
or
in
that
your
lives
pay
the
price
of
it
or
a
bloody
feud
break
out
between
the
claverings
of
blythburgh
and
the
de
cressis
of
dunwich
daughter
eve
get
you
to
bed
with
old
agnes
you
are
so
weary
that
you
will
not
mind
her
snores
ere
the
dawn
i
ll
talk
with
you
and
meanwhile
i
have
words
for
hugh
nay
have
no
fear
the
windows
are
all
barred
and
archer
dick
shall
watch
the
eve
went
unwillingly
enough
although
she
could
scarcely
walk
flashing
a
to
her
lover
with
her
fine
eyes
presently
grey
dick
also
went
to
sleep
like
a
dog
with
one
eye
open
in
the
little
near
to
the
great
door
now
hugh
said
father
arnold
when
they
were
left
alone
your
case
is
desperate
for
if
you
stay
here
certainly
these
claverings
will
have
your
blood
yet
if
you
can
be
got
away
safely
there
is
still
a
shaft
that
you
may
shoot
more
deadly
than
any
that
ever
left
grey
dick
s
quiver
but
yesterday
i
told
you
for
your
comfort
when
we
spoke
of
his
wooing
of
red
eve
that
this
norman
for
such
he
is
although
his
mother
was
english
and
he
was
english
born
is
a
traitor
to
king
edward
whom
he
pretends
to
ay
and
i
said
as
much
to
him
this
afternoon
when
he
prated
to
me
of
his
knightly
honour
and
though
i
had
no
time
to
take
note
of
faces
i
thought
he
liked
it
little
who
answered
hotly
that
i
was
a
i
am
sorry
hugh
it
may
put
him
on
his
guard
or
perhaps
he
ll
pay
no
heed
at
least
the
words
are
said
and
there
s
an
end
now
hearken
i
told
neither
you
nor
any
one
all
the
blackness
of
his
treachery
have
you
guessed
what
this
acour
is
here
to
do
spy
out
the
king
s
power
in
these
parts
i
more
than
that
and
he
dropped
his
voice
to
a
whisper
spy
out
a
safe
for
fifty
thousand
normans
upon
our
suffolk
coast
they
are
to
sail
hither
this
coming
summer
and
set
the
crown
of
england
upon
their
duke
john
who
will
hold
it
as
vassal
to
his
sire
philip
of
god
s
name
is
that
true
ay
though
in
such
a
devil
s
business
that
name
is
best
left
out
look
you
lad
i
had
warning
from
overseas
where
although
i
am
now
nothing
but
a
poor
old
priest
of
a
broken
order
i
still
have
friends
in
high
places
therefore
i
watched
and
found
that
messengers
were
passing
between
acour
and
france
one
of
these
messengers
a
priest
came
a
week
ago
to
dunwich
and
spent
the
night
in
a
tavern
waiting
for
his
ship
to
sail
in
the
morning
the
good
wife
who
keeps
that
tavern
ask
not
her
name
would
go
far
to
serve
me
that
night
this
priest
slept
sound
and
while
he
slept
a
letter
was
cut
from
the
lining
of
his
cassock
and
another
without
writing
sewn
there
in
place
of
it
so
that
he
ll
never
know
the
difference
till
he
reaches
john
of
normandy
and
then
not
where
he
lost
it
stay
you
shall
see
and
he
went
to
the
wall
and
from
some
secret
place
behind
the
hangings
produced
a
writing
which
he
handed
to
hugh
who
looked
at
it
then
gave
it
back
to
him
saying
read
it
to
me
father
english
i
can
spell
out
but
this
french
puzzles
my
so
he
read
hugh
listening
eagerly
to
every
word
my
lord
duke
this
by
a
faithful
hand
that
you
know
to
tell
you
all
goes
well
with
your
grace
s
business
and
with
that
of
your
royal
father
while
pretending
to
hunt
or
hawk
i
have
found
three
places
along
this
seaboard
at
any
one
of
which
the
army
can
land
next
summer
with
little
resistance
to
fear
for
though
the
land
is
rich
in
cattle
and
corn
the
people
are
few
these
places
of
which
i
have
made
survey
have
deep
water
up
to
the
beach
i
will
tell
you
of
them
more
particularly
when
i
return
meanwhile
i
linger
here
for
sundry
reasons
which
you
know
hoping
to
draw
those
of
whom
you
speak
to
me
to
your
cause
which
god
aiding
me
i
shall
do
since
he
of
england
has
wronged
one
of
them
and
slighted
the
others
so
that
they
are
bitter
against
him
and
ready
to
listen
to
the
promises
which
i
make
in
your
name
as
an
excuse
for
my
long
stay
that
has
caused
doubts
in
some
quarters
i
speak
of
my
suffolk
lands
which
need
my
care
also
i
court
the
daughter
of
my
host
here
the
knight
of
clavering
a
stubborn
englishman
who
can
not
be
won
but
a
man
of
great
power
and
repute
this
courtship
which
began
in
jest
has
ended
in
earnest
since
the
girl
is
very
haughty
and
beautiful
and
as
she
will
not
be
played
with
i
propose
with
your
good
leave
to
make
her
my
wife
her
father
accepts
my
suit
and
when
he
and
the
brother
are
out
of
the
way
as
doubtless
may
happen
after
your
army
comes
she
will
have
great
possessions
i
thank
your
grace
for
the
promise
of
the
wide
english
lands
of
which
i
spoke
to
you
and
the
title
that
goes
with
them
these
i
will
do
my
best
to
earn
nor
will
i
ask
for
them
till
i
kneel
before
you
when
you
are
crowned
king
of
england
at
westminster
as
i
doubt
not
god
will
bring
about
before
this
year
is
out
i
have
made
a
map
of
the
road
by
which
your
army
should
march
on
london
after
landing
and
of
the
towns
to
be
sacked
upon
the
way
thither
this
however
i
keep
since
although
not
one
in
ten
thousand
of
these
english
swine
can
read
french
or
any
other
tongue
should
it
chance
to
be
lost
all
can
understand
a
map
not
that
there
is
any
fear
of
loss
for
who
will
meddle
with
a
priest
who
carries
credentials
signed
by
his
holiness
himself
i
do
homage
to
your
grace
this
written
with
my
hand
from
blythburgh
in
suffolk
on
the
twentieth
day
of
february
edmund
of
noyon
father
arnold
ceased
reading
and
hugh
gasped
out
what
a
fool
is
this
most
men
are
my
son
in
this
way
or
in
that
and
the
few
wise
profit
by
their
folly
thus
this
letter
which
he
thought
so
safe
will
save
england
to
edward
and
his
race
you
from
many
dangers
your
betrothed
from
a
marriage
which
she
hates
that
is
if
you
can
get
safe
away
with
it
from
where
to
father
to
king
edward
in
london
with
another
that
i
will
write
for
you
ere
the
but
is
it
safe
father
to
trust
so
precious
a
thing
to
me
who
have
bitter
enemies
awaiting
me
and
may
as
like
as
not
be
crow
s
meat
by
father
arnold
looked
at
him
with
his
soft
and
dreamy
eyes
then
said
i
think
the
crow
s
not
hatched
that
will
pick
your
bones
hugh
though
at
the
last
there
be
crows
or
worms
for
all
of
why
not
father
doubtless
this
morning
young
john
of
clavering
thought
as
much
and
now
he
is
in
the
or
food
for
would
you
like
to
hear
hugh
and
will
you
keep
it
to
yourself
even
from
eve
ay
that
i
would
and
he
ll
think
me
mad
muttered
the
old
priest
to
himself
then
went
on
aloud
as
one
who
takes
a
sudden
resolution
well
i
ll
tell
you
leaving
you
to
make
what
you
will
of
a
story
that
till
now
has
been
heard
by
no
living
far
in
the
east
is
the
great
country
that
we
call
cathay
though
in
truth
it
has
many
other
names
and
i
alone
of
all
who
breathe
in
england
have
visited
that
how
did
you
get
there
asked
hugh
amazed
for
though
he
knew
dimly
that
father
arnold
had
travelled
much
in
his
youth
he
never
dreamed
that
he
had
reached
the
mystic
territories
of
cathay
or
indeed
that
such
a
place
really
was
except
in
fable
it
would
take
from
now
till
morning
to
tell
son
nor
even
then
would
you
understand
the
road
it
is
enough
to
say
that
i
went
on
a
pilgrimage
to
jerusalem
where
our
blessed
saviour
died
that
was
the
beginning
thence
i
travelled
with
arabs
to
the
red
sea
where
wild
men
made
a
slave
of
me
and
we
were
blown
across
the
indian
ocean
to
a
beauteous
island
named
ceylon
in
which
all
the
folk
are
black
from
this
place
i
escaped
in
a
vessel
called
a
junk
that
brought
me
to
the
town
of
singapore
thence
at
last
following
my
star
i
came
to
cathay
after
two
years
of
journeyings
there
i
dwelt
in
honour
for
three
more
years
moving
from
place
to
place
since
never
before
had
its
inhabitants
seen
a
western
man
and
they
made
much
of
me
always
sending
me
forward
to
new
cities
so
at
length
i
reached
the
greatest
of
them
all
which
is
called
kambaluc
or
peking
and
there
was
the
guest
of
its
emperor
timur
all
the
story
of
my
life
and
adventures
yonder
i
have
written
down
and
any
who
will
may
read
it
after
i
am
dead
but
of
these
i
have
no
time
to
speak
nor
have
they
anything
to
do
with
you
whilst
i
dwelt
in
kambaluc
as
the
guest
of
the
emperor
timur
i
made
study
of
the
religion
of
this
mighty
people
who
i
was
told
worshipped
gods
in
the
shape
of
men
i
visited
a
shrine
called
the
temple
of
heaven
hoping
that
there
i
should
see
such
a
god
who
was
named
tien
but
found
in
it
nothing
but
splendid
emptiness
then
i
asked
if
there
was
no
god
that
i
could
see
with
my
eyes
whereon
the
emperor
laughed
at
me
and
said
there
was
such
a
god
but
he
counselled
me
not
to
visit
him
i
prayed
him
to
suffer
me
to
do
so
since
i
who
worshipped
the
only
true
god
feared
no
other
whereon
growing
angry
he
commanded
some
of
his
servants
to
take
this
fool
to
the
house
of
murgh
and
let
him
see
whether
his
god
could
protect
him
against
having
said
this
he
bade
me
farewell
adding
that
though
every
man
must
meet
murgh
once
few
met
him
twice
and
therefore
he
did
not
think
that
he
should
see
me
again
now
in
my
heart
i
grew
afraid
but
none
would
tell
me
more
of
this
murgh
or
what
was
likely
to
happen
to
me
at
his
hands
still
i
would
not
show
any
fear
and
strong
in
the
faith
of
christ
i
determined
to
look
upon
this
idol
for
such
i
expected
him
to
be
that
night
the
servants
of
timur
bore
me
out
of
the
city
in
a
litter
and
by
the
starlight
i
saw
that
we
travelled
toward
a
hill
through
great
graveyards
where
people
were
burying
their
dead
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
they
set
me
down
upon
a
road
and
told
me
to
walk
up
it
and
that
at
dawn
i
should
see
the
house
of
murgh
whereof
the
gates
were
always
open
and
could
enter
there
if
i
wished
i
asked
if
they
would
wait
for
my
return
whereon
they
answered
smiling
that
if
i
so
desired
they
would
do
so
till
evening
but
that
it
seemed
scarcely
needful
since
they
did
not
suppose
that
i
should
return
do
yonder
pilgrims
to
the
house
of
murgh
return
asked
their
captain
pointing
towards
those
graveyards
which
we
had
passed
i
made
no
answer
but
walked
forward
up
a
broad
and
easy
road
unchallenged
of
any
till
i
came
to
what
even
in
that
dim
light
i
could
see
was
a
great
and
frowning
gateway
whereof
the
doors
appeared
to
be
open
now
at
first
i
thought
i
would
pass
this
gateway
at
once
and
see
what
lay
beyond
but
from
this
i
was
held
back
by
some
great
fear
for
which
i
could
find
no
cause
unless
it
were
bred
of
what
the
emperor
and
his
servants
had
said
to
me
so
i
remembered
their
words
namely
that
i
should
tarry
till
dawn
to
enter
the
house
there
then
i
tarried
seated
on
the
ground
before
the
gateway
and
feeling
as
though
yet
alive
i
had
descended
among
the
dead
indeed
the
silence
was
that
of
the
dead
no
voice
spoke
no
hound
barked
no
leaf
stirred
only
far
above
me
i
heard
a
continual
soughing
as
though
winged
souls
passed
to
and
fro
never
in
my
life
had
i
felt
so
much
alone
never
so
much
afraid
at
length
the
dawn
broke
and
oh
glad
was
i
to
see
its
light
for
fear
lest
i
should
die
in
darkness
now
i
saw
that
i
was
on
a
hilltop
where
grew
great
groves
of
cedar
trees
and
that
set
amid
them
was
a
temple
surrounded
by
a
wall
built
of
black
brick
it
was
not
a
great
place
although
the
gateway
which
was
surmounted
by
two
black
dragons
of
stone
or
iron
was
very
great
so
great
that
a
tall
ship
could
have
sailed
through
it
and
left
its
arch
untouched
i
kneeled
down
and
prayed
to
the
blessed
saints
and
the
guardian
angels
to
protect
me
then
i
arose
crossed
myself
to
scare
off
all
evil
things
by
that
holy
sign
and
set
forward
toward
the
mighty
gateway
oh
never
never
till
that
hour
had
i
understood
how
lowly
a
thing
is
man
on
that
broad
road
travelling
toward
the
awful
arch
beyond
which
lay
i
knew
not
what
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
was
the
only
man
left
in
the
world
i
whose
hour
had
come
to
enter
the
portals
of
destruction
i
passed
into
the
cold
shadow
of
the
gateway
unchallenged
by
any
watchman
and
found
myself
in
a
courtyard
surrounded
by
a
wall
also
built
of
black
brick
which
had
doors
in
it
that
seemed
to
be
of
dark
stone
or
iron
whither
these
doors
led
i
do
not
know
since
the
wall
cut
off
the
sight
of
any
buildings
that
may
have
lain
beyond
in
the
centre
of
this
courtyard
was
a
pool
of
still
black
water
and
at
the
head
of
the
pool
a
chair
of
black
sir
andrew
paused
and
hugh
said
a
plain
place
for
a
temple
father
without
adornments
or
images
but
perhaps
this
was
the
outer
court
and
the
temple
stood
ay
son
the
plainest
temple
that
ever
i
saw
who
have
seen
many
in
all
lands
though
what
was
beyond
it
i
do
not
know
and
yet
terrible
terrible
terrible
i
tell
you
that
those
black
walls
and
that
black
water
were
more
fearsome
to
look
on
than
any
churchyard
vault
grim
with
bones
or
a
where
victims
quiver
out
their
souls
midst
shrieks
and
groanings
and
yet
i
could
see
nothing
of
which
to
be
afraid
and
hear
nothing
save
that
soughing
of
invisible
wings
whereof
i
have
spoken
an
empty
chair
a
pool
of
water
some
walls
and
doors
and
above
the
quiet
sky
what
was
there
to
fear
in
such
things
as
these
still
so
greatly
did
i
fear
that
i
sank
to
my
knees
and
began
to
pray
once
more
this
time
to
the
blessed
saviour
himself
since
i
was
sure
that
none
else
could
help
me
when
i
looked
up
again
the
chair
was
no
longer
empty
hugh
a
man
sat
in
it
of
whom
i
thought
at
first
only
one
thing
that
he
must
be
very
strong
though
not
bigger
than
other
men
strength
seemed
to
flow
from
him
i
should
not
have
wondered
if
he
had
placed
his
hands
upon
the
massive
sides
of
that
stone
chair
and
torn
it
what
was
he
like
father
samson
or
goliath
i
never
saw
either
son
so
can
not
say
but
what
was
he
like
oh
i
can
not
say
that
either
although
still
i
see
him
in
my
heart
my
mortal
lips
will
not
tell
the
likeness
of
that
man
perhaps
because
he
seemed
to
be
like
all
men
and
yet
different
from
all
he
had
an
iron
brow
beneath
which
shone
deep
cold
eyes
he
was
or
perchance
his
face
grew
no
hair
his
lips
were
thick
and
still
and
his
features
did
not
change
like
those
of
other
men
he
looked
as
though
he
could
not
change
as
though
he
had
been
thus
for
infinite
ages
and
yet
remained
neither
young
nor
old
as
for
his
dress
he
wore
a
cloak
of
flaming
red
such
a
cloak
as
your
eve
loves
to
wear
and
white
sandals
on
his
feet
there
was
no
covering
on
his
shaven
head
which
gleamed
like
a
skull
his
breast
was
naked
but
across
it
hung
one
row
of
black
jewels
from
the
sheen
of
them
i
think
they
must
have
been
pearls
which
are
sometimes
found
of
that
colour
in
the
east
he
had
no
weapon
nor
staff
and
his
hands
hung
down
on
either
side
of
the
chair
for
a
long
while
i
watched
him
but
if
he
saw
me
he
took
no
note
as
i
watched
i
perceived
that
birds
were
coming
to
and
leaving
him
in
countless
numbers
and
thought
that
it
must
be
their
wings
which
made
the
constant
soughing
sound
that
filled
all
the
still
and
dreadful
what
kind
of
birds
were
they
father
i
am
not
sure
but
i
think
doves
at
least
their
flight
was
straight
and
swift
like
to
that
of
doves
yet
of
this
i
am
not
sure
either
since
i
saw
each
of
them
for
but
a
second
as
they
reached
the
man
they
appeared
out
of
nothingness
they
were
of
two
colours
and
the
white
appeared
upon
his
right
side
the
black
upon
his
left
side
each
bird
in
those
streams
hovered
for
an
instant
by
his
head
the
white
over
his
right
shoulder
the
black
over
his
left
shoulder
as
though
they
whispered
a
message
to
his
ear
and
having
whispered
were
gone
upon
their
what
was
that
errand
father
how
can
i
know
as
no
one
ever
told
me
yet
i
will
hazard
a
guess
that
it
had
to
do
with
the
mystery
of
life
and
death
souls
that
were
born
into
the
world
and
souls
departing
from
the
world
perchance
making
report
to
one
of
god
s
ministers
clothed
in
flesh
but
who
can
say
at
least
i
watched
those
magic
fowls
till
my
eyes
grew
dizzy
and
a
sort
of
slumber
began
to
creep
into
my
brain
how
long
i
stayed
thus
i
do
not
remember
for
i
had
lost
all
sense
of
time
in
the
end
however
i
was
awakened
by
a
cold
soft
voice
the
sound
of
which
seemed
to
flow
through
my
veins
like
ice
that
addressed
me
in
our
own
rough
english
tongue
spoken
as
you
and
i
learned
it
at
our
nurses
knees
to
what
god
were
you
praying
just
now
andrew
arnold
oh
sir
i
answered
how
do
you
who
dwell
in
cathay
where
i
am
a
stranger
know
my
language
and
my
name
he
lifted
his
cold
eyes
and
looked
at
me
and
i
felt
them
pierce
into
the
depths
of
my
soul
in
the
same
way
that
i
know
your
heart
he
said
but
do
not
ask
questions
answer
them
that
i
may
learn
whether
you
are
a
true
man
or
a
i
was
praying
to
christ
i
faltered
the
saviour
of
us
a
great
god
andrew
arnold
and
a
pure
though
his
followers
are
few
in
the
world
as
yet
but
do
you
think
that
he
can
save
you
from
me
as
you
were
asking
him
to
do
he
can
save
my
soul
i
replied
plucking
up
courage
who
would
not
deny
the
lord
even
in
a
devil
s
den
ah
your
soul
well
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
souls
except
to
count
them
as
they
pass
through
my
dominion
and
you
are
quite
right
to
pray
to
one
of
the
lords
of
that
into
which
you
go
now
man
what
is
your
business
with
me
and
why
do
you
visit
one
of
whom
you
are
so
much
afraid
o
murgh
i
began
then
ceased
for
i
knew
not
what
to
answer
so
they
have
told
you
my
name
now
i
will
tell
you
one
of
its
meanings
it
is
gate
of
the
why
did
you
dare
to
visit
gate
of
the
gods
you
fear
to
answer
listen
you
came
forth
to
see
some
painted
idol
or
some
bedizened
priest
muttering
rites
he
does
not
understand
to
that
which
is
not
and
lo
you
have
found
that
which
is
behind
all
idols
and
all
priests
you
sought
an
incensed
and
a
golden
shrine
and
you
have
found
only
the
black
and
iron
portals
which
every
man
must
pass
but
which
few
desire
to
enter
until
they
are
called
well
you
are
young
and
strong
come
try
a
fall
with
murgh
and
when
he
has
thrown
you
rise
and
choose
which
of
those
ways
you
will
and
he
swept
his
hand
toward
the
doors
around
him
then
forget
this
world
and
enter
into
that
which
you
have
now
because
i
could
not
help
myself
i
rose
from
my
knees
and
advanced
or
was
drawn
toward
that
dreadful
man
as
i
came
he
too
rose
from
his
chair
stretching
out
his
arms
as
a
wrestler
does
and
i
knew
that
within
the
circle
of
those
arms
lay
my
death
still
i
who
in
my
youth
was
held
brave
went
on
and
rushed
striving
to
clasp
him
next
moment
before
ever
i
touched
him
oh
well
was
it
for
me
that
i
touched
him
not
some
strength
seized
me
and
whirled
me
round
and
round
as
a
dead
leaf
is
whirled
by
the
wind
and
tossed
me
up
and
cast
me
down
and
left
me
prone
and
nerveless
rise
said
the
cold
voice
above
me
for
you
are
so
i
rose
and
felt
even
then
that
i
who
thought
that
every
bone
in
my
body
must
be
broken
was
stronger
than
i
had
ever
been
before
it
was
as
though
the
lamp
which
had
burnt
low
was
filled
suddenly
with
a
new
and
purer
oil
man
said
mine
adversary
and
i
thought
that
in
his
cold
eyes
there
was
something
like
a
smile
did
you
think
to
touch
murgh
and
live
did
you
think
to
wrestle
with
him
as
in
a
book
of
one
of
your
prophets
a
certain
jacob
wrestled
with
an
angel
and
conquered
until
it
was
his
turn
to
pass
the
gate
of
the
gods
now
i
stared
at
this
dweller
in
cathay
who
spoke
my
tongue
and
knew
the
tale
of
jacob
in
the
ancient
book
then
answered
sir
murgh
or
sir
gate
or
whatever
your
name
may
be
i
thought
to
do
nothing
you
drew
me
to
you
you
challenged
me
and
since
by
the
rule
of
my
order
i
may
refuse
no
challenge
from
one
who
is
not
a
christian
i
came
on
to
do
my
best
but
before
ever
i
laid
hand
on
you
i
was
cast
down
by
a
wind
that
is
all
the
story
save
that
it
has
pleased
you
to
let
me
live
who
evidently
could
have
slain
me
for
which
i
thank
you
are
wrong
sir
andrew
he
answered
i
did
not
draw
you
to
me
men
come
to
murgh
at
their
appointed
hour
murgh
does
not
come
to
them
you
sought
him
before
your
hour
and
therefore
he
refused
you
yet
you
will
meet
him
again
as
all
flesh
must
when
its
hour
comes
and
because
you
are
bold
and
have
not
cringed
before
my
strength
for
your
comfort
i
will
show
you
when
and
how
stand
by
me
but
lay
no
hand
on
me
or
my
robe
and
look
into
my
glass
while
for
a
moment
for
your
sake
i
stay
the
stream
of
time
and
show
you
what
lies
beneath
its
foam
that
blinds
the
eyes
of
he
waved
his
arms
and
the
black
doves
and
the
white
doves
ceased
to
appear
and
disappear
and
the
eternal
soughings
of
their
wings
was
silent
he
pointed
to
the
water
at
his
feet
and
i
saw
not
a
picture
but
a
scene
so
real
that
i
could
have
sworn
it
was
alive
about
me
yes
those
who
took
part
in
it
stood
in
front
of
me
as
though
the
pool
were
solid
ground
that
their
feet
pressed
were
one
of
them
son
were
one
of
them
and
the
old
knight
paused
supporting
himself
against
the
as
though
that
recollection
overcame
him
what
did
you
see
whispered
hugh
by
god
s
holy
name
i
saw
the
blythburgh
marshes
deep
in
snow
that
was
red
with
the
light
of
sunrise
oh
i
could
not
be
mistook
and
there
ran
the
wintry
river
there
the
church
tower
soared
there
were
the
frowning
banks
there
was
the
rough
moorland
over
which
the
east
wind
piped
for
the
dead
bracken
bent
before
it
and
not
twenty
paces
from
me
leaped
a
hare
disturbed
suddenly
from
its
form
by
a
hungry
fox
whose
red
head
peeped
through
the
reeds
yes
yes
i
saw
the
brute
s
white
teeth
gleam
as
it
licked
its
disappointed
lips
and
i
felt
glad
that
its
prey
had
beaten
it
when
you
look
upon
that
scene
hugh
as
one
day
you
shall
remember
the
hare
and
the
head
of
the
hungry
fox
and
by
these
judge
my
a
fox
and
a
hare
broke
in
hugh
i
d
show
you
such
was
there
no
more
ay
much
for
instance
a
hollow
in
the
marsh
an
open
grave
and
an
axe
yes
an
axe
that
had
delved
it
where
the
bog
was
soft
beneath
the
snow
grey
dick
held
the
axe
in
one
hand
and
his
black
bow
in
the
other
while
red
eve
your
eve
stood
at
its
edge
and
stared
into
it
like
one
in
a
dream
then
at
the
head
of
the
grave
an
old
old
man
clad
in
mail
beneath
his
priestly
robes
and
that
man
hugh
grown
very
ancient
but
still
myself
and
no
other
and
at
the
foot
of
the
grave
hugh
de
cressi
you
and
no
other
wayworn
and
fierce
but
also
clad
in
mail
and
wearing
a
knight
s
crest
upon
your
shield
you
with
drawn
sword
in
hand
and
facing
you
also
with
drawn
sword
rage
and
despair
on
his
dark
face
a
stately
man
whom
mine
eyes
have
never
seen
but
whom
i
should
know
again
midst
a
million
a
man
who
i
think
was
doomed
to
fill
the
grave
lastly
standing
on
a
little
mound
near
to
the
bank
of
the
swirling
river
where
jagged
sheets
of
ice
ground
against
each
other
like
the
teeth
of
the
wicked
in
hell
strangely
capped
and
clad
in
black
his
arms
crossed
upon
his
breast
and
a
light
smile
in
his
cold
eyes
he
who
was
called
murgh
in
cathay
he
who
named
himself
gateway
of
the
gods
for
a
moment
i
saw
then
all
was
gone
and
i
found
myself
i
know
not
why
walking
toward
the
mighty
arch
whereon
sat
the
iron
dragons
in
its
shadow
i
turned
and
looked
back
there
at
the
head
of
the
pool
the
man
was
seated
in
his
chair
and
to
right
and
to
left
of
him
came
the
black
doves
and
the
white
doves
in
countless
multitudes
all
the
thousands
of
them
that
had
been
stayed
in
their
flight
pouring
down
upon
him
at
once
or
so
i
thought
they
wheeled
about
his
head
they
hid
his
face
from
me
and
i
i
departed
into
the
shadow
of
the
arch
and
i
saw
him
and
them
no
chapter
iv
the
penance
the
tale
was
done
and
these
two
stood
staring
at
one
another
from
each
side
of
the
glowing
hearth
whose
red
light
illumined
their
faces
at
length
the
heavy
silence
was
broken
by
sir
andrew
i
read
your
heart
hugh
he
said
as
murgh
read
mine
for
i
think
that
he
gave
me
not
only
strength
but
something
of
his
wisdom
also
whereby
i
was
able
to
win
safe
back
to
england
and
to
this
hour
to
walk
unharmed
by
many
a
pit
i
read
your
heart
and
in
its
book
is
written
that
you
think
me
mad
one
who
pleases
his
old
age
with
tales
of
marvel
that
others
told
him
or
which
his
own
brain
not
so
father
answered
hugh
uneasily
for
in
truth
some
such
thoughts
were
passing
through
his
mind
only
only
the
thing
is
very
strange
and
it
happened
so
long
ago
before
eve
and
i
were
born
before
those
that
begot
us
were
born
either
yes
more
than
fifty
years
ago
it
may
be
sixty
i
forget
in
sixty
years
the
memory
plays
strange
tricks
with
men
no
doubt
so
how
can
i
blame
you
if
you
believe
what
you
do
believe
and
yet
hugh
he
went
on
after
a
pause
and
speaking
with
passion
this
was
no
dream
of
which
i
tell
you
why
do
you
suppose
that
among
all
those
that
have
grown
up
about
me
i
have
chosen
you
out
to
love
you
and
your
eve
not
because
a
chance
made
me
your
godsire
and
her
my
pupil
i
say
that
from
your
infancy
your
faces
haunted
me
ay
and
when
you
had
turned
childhood
s
corner
and
once
i
met
the
pair
of
you
walking
hand
in
hand
then
of
a
sudden
i
knew
that
it
was
you
two
and
no
others
whom
that
god
or
devil
had
showed
to
me
standing
by
the
open
grave
upon
the
banks
of
blythe
i
knew
it
of
dick
the
archer
also
and
can
i
be
mistaken
of
such
a
man
as
that
who
has
no
fellow
in
england
but
you
think
i
dreamed
it
all
and
perhaps
i
should
not
have
spoken
though
something
made
me
speak
well
in
a
day
to
come
you
may
change
your
mind
since
whatever
dangers
threaten
you
will
not
die
yet
hugh
tell
me
now
what
is
this
frenchman
like
who
would
marry
eve
i
have
never
seen
hugh
who
was
glad
to
get
back
to
the
things
of
earth
described
acour
as
best
he
could
ah
said
sir
andrew
much
such
a
man
as
stood
face
to
face
with
you
by
the
grave
while
murgh
watched
and
you
are
not
likely
to
be
friends
are
you
but
i
forgot
you
have
determined
that
it
was
but
a
dream
and
now
you
are
wondering
how
he
who
is
called
gate
of
the
gods
in
cathay
could
come
to
blythburgh
well
i
think
that
all
the
world
is
his
garden
given
to
him
by
god
but
doubtless
that
s
only
another
face
of
my
dream
whereof
we
ll
speak
no
more
at
present
now
for
your
troubles
which
are
no
dream
lie
you
down
to
sleep
on
the
skin
of
that
striped
beast
i
killed
it
in
cathay
in
my
day
of
dreams
and
now
it
shall
serve
for
yours
from
which
may
the
dead
eyes
of
john
clavering
be
absent
i
go
forth
to
seek
your
father
and
to
arrange
certain
matters
with
grey
dick
at
the
door
you
ll
be
safe
for
a
while
i
think
if
not
here
s
a
cupboard
where
you
may
and
drawing
aside
the
arras
he
showed
him
a
certain
secret
place
large
enough
to
hold
a
man
then
left
the
room
hugh
laid
himself
upon
the
skin
of
the
beast
which
had
been
a
tiger
though
he
did
not
know
it
by
that
name
so
weary
was
he
that
not
all
he
had
gone
through
that
day
or
even
the
old
s
marvellous
tale
in
which
he
and
eve
played
so
wonderful
a
part
could
keep
his
eyes
from
closing
presently
he
was
fast
asleep
and
so
remained
until
four
hours
later
something
disturbed
him
and
he
awoke
to
see
sir
andrew
writing
at
a
desk
rise
my
son
said
the
old
priest
without
looking
up
from
his
paper
early
as
it
is
you
must
be
stirring
if
you
would
be
clear
of
dunwich
by
daybreak
and
keep
a
whole
skin
i
have
set
a
taper
in
my
yonder
and
there
you
ll
find
water
to
wash
with
and
a
stool
to
kneel
on
for
your
prayers
neither
of
which
neglect
since
you
have
blood
on
your
hands
and
great
need
for
heaven
s
so
hugh
arose
yawning
and
stumbled
heavily
to
the
chamber
for
he
was
still
faint
with
sleep
which
would
not
leave
him
till
he
had
plunged
his
head
into
a
basin
of
icy
water
this
done
he
knelt
and
prayed
as
he
had
been
bidden
with
a
very
earnest
heart
and
afterward
came
back
to
the
seeing
folk
gathered
there
as
he
entered
he
laid
hand
on
sword
not
his
own
with
which
he
had
killed
his
cousin
but
a
long
and
knightly
weapon
that
sir
andrew
had
given
him
with
the
armour
drawing
it
he
advanced
boldly
for
he
thought
that
his
enemies
might
have
found
him
out
and
that
his
best
safety
lay
in
courage
thus
he
appeared
in
the
ring
of
the
lamplight
clad
in
gleaming
steel
and
with
raised
weapon
what
son
asked
a
testy
voice
which
he
knew
for
that
of
his
own
father
is
it
not
enough
to
have
killed
your
cousin
would
you
fall
on
your
brothers
and
me
also
that
you
come
at
us
clad
in
mail
and
with
bare
steel
in
hand
hearing
these
words
hugh
sheathed
the
sword
and
advancing
toward
the
speaker
a
handsome
portly
man
who
wore
a
merchant
s
robe
lined
with
rich
fur
sank
to
his
knee
before
him
your
pardon
my
father
he
said
sir
andrew
here
will
have
told
you
the
story
also
that
i
am
not
to
blame
for
this
i
think
you
need
to
ask
it
replied
master
de
cressi
and
if
you
and
that
lean
henchman
of
yours
are
not
to
blame
then
say
who
is
now
a
tall
slim
figure
glided
up
to
them
it
was
eve
clothed
in
her
own
robe
again
and
beautiful
as
ever
after
her
short
rest
sir
i
am
to
blame
she
said
in
her
full
low
voice
my
need
was
sore
and
i
sent
a
messenger
to
hugh
bidding
him
meet
me
in
the
blythburgh
marsh
there
we
were
set
on
and
there
john
clavering
my
brother
smote
hugh
in
the
face
would
you
a
de
cressi
have
had
him
take
the
blow
and
yield
me
up
to
the
frenchman
by
god
and
my
forefathers
no
least
of
all
from
one
of
your
stock
saving
your
presence
answered
the
merchant
in
truth
had
he
done
so
dead
or
living
from
that
day
i
would
have
called
him
no
son
of
mine
yet
red
eve
you
and
he
and
your
have
brought
much
trouble
on
me
and
my
house
look
now
what
it
means
a
feud
to
the
death
between
our
families
of
which
no
man
can
foresee
the
end
moreover
how
can
you
marry
seeing
that
a
brother
s
blood
runs
between
you
it
is
on
john
s
head
she
answered
sadly
not
on
hugh
s
hand
i
warned
him
and
hugh
spared
him
once
what
more
could
we
do
i
know
not
eve
i
only
know
what
you
have
done
you
and
hugh
and
grey
dick
four
dead
and
two
wounded
that
s
the
bill
i
must
discharge
as
best
i
may
doubtless
too
soon
there
will
be
more
to
follow
whether
they
be
claverings
or
de
cressis
well
we
must
take
things
as
god
sends
them
and
leave
him
to
balance
the
account
but
there
is
no
time
to
lose
if
hugh
s
neck
is
to
escape
a
halter
speak
you
father
andrew
who
are
wise
and
old
and
have
this
matter
in
hand
oh
hugh
hugh
you
were
born
a
fighter
not
a
merchant
like
your
brethren
and
he
pointed
to
three
young
men
who
all
this
while
had
stood
silently
behind
him
looking
upon
their
youngest
brother
with
grave
disapproval
yes
the
old
norman
blood
comes
out
in
you
and
the
norman
mail
suits
you
well
he
added
with
a
flash
of
pride
and
so
there
s
an
end
or
a
beginning
now
sir
andrew
master
de
cressi
said
the
old
priest
your
son
hugh
rides
to
london
on
an
errand
of
mine
which
i
think
will
save
his
neck
from
that
halter
whereof
you
spoke
but
now
are
those
four
mounted
men
that
you
promised
me
ready
to
companion
him
they
will
be
within
an
hour
father
but
not
before
since
six
good
horses
can
not
be
laid
hands
on
in
the
dead
of
night
being
stabled
without
the
gates
but
what
is
this
message
of
yours
and
to
whom
does
hugh
go
to
his
grace
edward
the
king
none
less
geoffrey
de
cressi
with
that
which
shall
earn
pardon
for
him
and
dick
the
archer
or
so
i
believe
as
for
what
it
is
i
may
not
tell
you
or
any
man
it
has
to
do
with
great
matters
of
state
that
are
for
the
king
s
ear
alone
and
i
charge
you
every
one
on
your
honour
and
your
safety
to
make
no
mention
of
this
mission
without
these
walls
do
you
swear
geoffrey
de
cressi
and
you
his
sons
then
one
by
one
they
swore
to
be
secret
as
the
grave
and
eve
swore
also
though
of
her
he
had
sought
no
promise
when
this
was
finished
sir
andrew
asked
if
any
of
his
brothers
accompanied
hugh
saying
that
if
so
they
must
arm
no
answered
master
de
cressi
one
of
the
family
is
enough
to
risk
as
well
as
four
of
our
best
servants
my
sons
bide
here
with
me
who
may
need
their
help
though
they
are
not
trained
to
perhaps
it
is
as
well
said
sir
andrew
drily
though
were
i
their
age
well
let
that
be
now
son
hugh
before
you
eat
do
you
and
eve
come
with
me
into
the
at
these
words
hugh
flushed
red
with
joy
and
opened
his
lips
to
speak
nay
nay
broke
in
sir
andrew
with
a
frown
for
a
different
purpose
to
that
which
is
in
your
mind
man
is
this
a
time
for
marrying
and
giving
in
marriage
and
if
it
were
could
i
marry
you
who
are
stained
with
blood
tis
that
you
both
may
be
absolved
from
the
guilt
of
that
blood
and
learn
the
penance
which
god
decrees
to
you
through
the
mouth
of
me
his
unworthy
minister
in
payment
of
its
shedding
thus
you
son
may
go
forth
upon
your
great
adventure
with
a
clean
heart
and
you
daughter
may
await
what
shall
befall
with
a
quiet
mind
say
are
you
willing
now
they
bowed
their
heads
and
answered
that
they
were
though
eve
whispered
to
hugh
that
she
misdoubted
her
of
this
talk
of
penance
so
do
i
he
replied
beneath
his
breath
but
he
is
a
merciful
confessor
and
loves
us
from
some
it
might
be
they
passed
down
the
stairs
followed
by
master
de
cressi
and
his
sons
into
the
entrance
hall
where
grey
dick
stood
watching
by
the
door
whither
go
they
he
asked
of
sir
andrew
for
their
road
is
to
confession
at
god
s
altar
answered
the
old
priest
do
you
come
also
richard
oh
he
replied
i
hoped
it
had
been
to
breakfast
as
for
confession
i
have
naught
upon
my
soul
save
that
i
shot
too
low
at
the
bide
where
you
are
o
man
of
blood
said
sir
andrew
sternly
and
pray
that
a
better
mood
be
given
to
you
before
it
is
too
ay
father
he
answered
unabashed
i
ll
pray
and
it
is
as
well
that
one
should
wait
to
watch
the
door
lest
you
should
all
presently
become
men
of
blood
against
your
turning
to
the
right
sir
andrew
led
them
down
steps
to
a
passage
underground
that
joined
the
temple
to
the
church
of
the
holy
virgin
and
john
it
was
but
short
and
at
the
end
of
it
they
found
a
massive
door
which
he
unbolted
and
passing
this
door
entered
the
great
building
whereof
the
silence
and
the
icy
cold
struck
them
like
blows
they
had
but
two
lanterns
between
them
one
of
which
master
de
cressi
and
his
elder
sons
took
with
them
to
the
nave
of
the
church
bearing
the
other
sir
andrew
departed
into
the
vestry
leaving
hugh
and
eve
seated
together
in
the
darkness
of
the
chancel
stalls
presently
his
light
reappeared
in
the
confessional
where
he
sat
robed
and
thither
at
his
summons
went
first
hugh
and
then
eve
when
their
tales
were
told
those
who
watched
in
the
nave
of
the
splendid
building
which
reared
by
the
knights
templar
was
already
following
that
great
order
to
decay
and
ruin
saw
the
star
of
light
he
bore
ascend
to
the
high
altar
here
he
set
it
down
and
advancing
to
the
rail
addressed
the
two
shadowy
figures
that
knelt
before
him
son
and
daughter
he
said
you
have
made
confession
with
contrite
hearts
and
the
church
has
given
you
absolution
for
your
sins
yet
penance
remains
and
because
those
sins
though
grievous
in
themselves
were
not
altogether
of
your
own
making
it
shall
be
light
hugh
de
cressi
and
eve
clavering
who
are
bound
together
by
lawful
love
between
man
and
woman
and
the
solemn
oath
of
betrothal
which
you
here
renew
before
god
this
is
the
penance
that
i
lay
upon
you
by
virtue
of
the
authority
in
me
vested
as
a
priest
of
christ
because
between
you
runs
the
blood
of
john
clavering
the
cousin
of
one
of
you
and
the
brother
of
the
other
slain
by
you
hugh
de
cressi
in
mortal
combat
but
yester
eve
i
decree
and
enjoin
that
for
a
full
year
from
this
day
you
shall
not
be
bound
together
as
man
and
wife
in
the
holy
bonds
of
matrimony
nor
converse
after
the
fashion
of
affianced
lovers
if
you
obey
this
her
command
faithfully
then
by
my
mouth
the
church
declares
that
after
the
year
has
gone
by
you
may
lawfully
be
wed
where
and
when
you
will
moreover
she
pronounces
her
solemn
blessing
on
you
both
and
her
dreadful
curse
upon
any
and
upon
all
who
shall
dare
to
sunder
you
against
your
desires
and
of
this
blessing
and
this
curse
let
all
the
congregation
take
now
hugh
and
eve
rose
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
when
they
had
gone
the
priest
celebrated
a
short
mass
but
two
or
three
prayers
and
a
blessing
which
done
all
of
them
returned
to
the
preceptory
as
they
had
come
here
food
was
waiting
for
them
prepared
by
the
old
sister
agnes
it
was
a
somewhat
silent
meal
of
which
no
one
ate
very
much
except
grey
dick
who
remarked
aloud
that
as
this
might
be
his
last
breakfast
it
should
be
plentiful
since
shriven
or
unshriven
it
was
better
to
die
upon
a
full
stomach
master
de
cressi
called
him
an
impious
knave
then
he
asked
him
if
he
had
plenty
of
arrows
because
if
not
he
would
find
four
dozen
of
the
best
that
could
be
made
in
norwich
done
up
in
a
cloak
on
the
grey
horse
he
was
to
ride
and
a
spare
bow
also
i
thank
you
for
the
arrows
master
but
as
for
the
bow
i
use
none
but
my
own
the
black
bow
which
the
sea
brought
to
me
and
death
alone
shall
part
from
me
perchance
both
will
be
wanted
since
the
claverings
will
scarcely
let
us
out
of
the
sanctuary
if
they
can
help
it
still
it
is
true
they
may
not
know
where
we
lie
hid
and
that
is
our
best
chance
of
eating
more
good
breakfasts
this
side
the
a
pest
on
your
evil
talk
said
de
cressi
with
an
uneasy
laugh
for
he
loved
hugh
best
of
all
his
sons
and
was
afraid
of
him
get
through
safely
man
and
though
i
like
not
your
grim
face
and
bloody
ways
you
shall
lose
little
by
it
i
promise
you
he
added
in
a
whisper
that
if
you
bring
my
boy
safe
home
again
you
shall
not
want
for
all
your
life
ay
and
if
there
is
need
i
ll
pay
your
for
thank
you
master
thank
you
i
ll
remember
and
for
my
part
promise
you
this
that
if
he
does
not
return
safe
dick
the
archer
never
will
but
i
think
i
ll
live
to
shoot
more
than
your
four
dozen
of
as
he
spoke
there
came
a
knock
upon
the
outer
door
and
every
one
sprang
up
fear
not
said
sir
andrew
doubtless
it
will
be
the
men
with
the
horses
i
ll
go
look
come
you
with
me
presently
he
returned
saying
that
it
was
so
and
that
master
de
cressi
s
servants
were
waiting
with
the
beasts
in
the
courtyard
also
that
they
brought
tidings
that
some
of
the
clavering
party
were
now
at
the
mayor
s
house
rousing
him
from
his
sleep
doubtless
to
lay
information
of
the
slayings
and
ask
for
warrant
to
take
those
who
wrought
them
should
they
be
in
the
borough
then
we
had
best
be
going
said
hugh
since
soon
they
will
be
here
with
or
without
their
ay
answered
sir
andrew
here
are
the
papers
take
them
hugh
and
hide
them
well
and
if
any
accident
should
befall
you
try
to
pass
them
on
to
richard
that
they
may
be
delivered
into
the
king
s
hands
at
westminster
say
that
sir
andrew
arnold
sends
you
on
business
that
has
to
do
with
his
grace
s
safety
and
neither
of
you
will
be
refused
a
hearing
then
act
as
he
may
command
you
and
maybe
ere
long
we
shall
see
you
back
at
dunwich
i
think
it
is
the
claverings
and
their
french
lord
who
need
pardon
not
i
said
hugh
but
be
that
as
it
may
what
of
eve
fear
not
for
eve
son
for
here
she
bides
in
sanctuary
until
the
frenchman
is
out
of
england
or
perchance
he
added
grimly
under
english
ay
ay
we
ll
guard
the
maid
broke
in
master
de
cressi
come
to
saddle
ere
you
be
so
they
descended
to
a
back
entrance
and
through
it
into
the
courtyard
where
the
four
armed
men
waited
with
six
good
horses
one
of
them
hugh
s
own
here
he
bade
farewell
to
his
brothers
to
his
father
who
kissed
him
on
the
brow
and
to
sir
andrew
who
stretched
his
hand
above
his
head
in
blessing
then
he
turned
to
eve
and
was
about
to
embrace
her
even
before
that
company
when
sir
andrew
looked
at
him
and
remembering
the
penance
that
had
been
laid
upon
him
he
but
pressed
her
hand
whispering
god
be
with
you
sweetheart
he
is
with
us
all
but
i
would
that
you
could
be
with
me
also
she
answered
in
the
same
low
voice
still
man
must
forth
to
battle
and
woman
must
wait
and
watch
for
that
is
the
world
s
way
whate
er
befalls
remember
that
dead
or
living
i
ll
be
wife
to
no
man
but
you
begone
now
ere
my
heart
fails
me
and
guard
yourself
well
remembering
that
you
bear
in
your
breast
not
one
life
but
then
hugh
swung
himself
to
the
saddle
of
which
grey
dick
had
already
tested
the
girths
and
stirrup
leathers
in
another
minute
the
six
of
them
were
clattering
over
the
stones
of
middlegate
street
while
the
burgesses
of
dunwich
peeped
from
their
window
places
wondering
what
knight
with
armed
men
rode
through
their
town
thus
early
just
as
the
grey
dawn
broke
they
passed
the
gate
which
there
being
peace
in
the
land
was
already
open
fifteen
minutes
later
they
were
on
the
lonely
westleton
heath
where
for
a
while
naught
was
to
be
heard
save
the
scream
of
the
curlew
and
the
rush
of
the
wings
of
the
passing
landward
from
the
sea
presently
however
another
sound
reached
their
ears
that
of
horses
galloping
behind
them
grey
dick
pulled
rein
and
listened
seven
i
think
not
more
he
said
now
master
do
you
stand
or
run
for
these
will
be
clavering
horses
hugh
thought
for
a
moment
his
aim
was
not
to
fight
but
to
get
through
to
london
yet
if
he
fled
the
pursuers
would
raise
the
country
on
them
as
they
came
so
that
in
the
end
they
must
be
taken
since
those
who
followed
would
find
fresh
horses
it
seems
best
to
stand
he
said
so
say
i
answered
grey
dick
and
led
the
way
to
a
little
hillock
by
the
roadside
on
which
grew
some
firs
here
they
dismounted
and
gave
their
horses
into
the
keeping
of
one
man
while
grey
dick
and
the
others
drew
their
bows
from
the
cases
and
strung
them
scarcely
had
they
done
so
when
the
mist
lifting
in
the
morning
breeze
showed
them
their
pursuers
seven
of
them
as
dick
had
said
headed
by
one
of
the
french
knights
and
riding
scattered
between
two
and
three
hundred
yards
away
at
the
same
moment
a
shout
told
them
that
they
had
been
seen
hark
now
all
said
hugh
i
would
shed
no
more
blood
if
it
may
be
so
who
have
earned
enough
of
penance
therefore
shoot
at
the
horses
not
at
the
riders
who
without
them
will
be
helpless
and
let
no
man
harm
a
clavering
unless
it
be
to
save
his
own
poor
sport
grunted
grey
dick
nevertheless
when
the
norman
knight
who
led
came
within
two
hundred
yards
shouting
to
them
in
french
to
surrender
dick
lifted
his
great
bow
drew
and
loosed
carelessly
as
though
he
shot
at
hazard
the
others
holding
their
bows
till
the
claverings
were
nearer
yet
there
was
little
of
hazard
when
grey
dick
shot
save
to
that
at
which
he
aimed
away
rushed
the
arrow
rising
high
and
as
it
seemed
bearing
somewhat
to
the
left
of
the
knight
yet
when
it
drew
near
to
that
knight
the
wind
told
on
it
and
bent
it
inward
as
he
knew
it
would
fair
and
full
it
struck
upon
the
horse
s
chest
piercing
through
to
the
heart
so
that
down
the
poor
beast
came
throwing
its
rider
to
the
ground
a
good
shot
enough
grumbled
grey
dick
still
it
is
a
shame
to
slay
nags
of
such
a
breed
and
let
the
rogues
who
ride
them
but
his
companions
only
stared
at
him
almost
in
awe
while
the
other
clavering
men
rode
on
before
they
had
covered
fifty
paces
again
the
great
bow
twanged
and
again
a
horse
was
seen
to
rear
itself
up
shaking
the
rider
from
its
back
and
then
plunge
away
to
die
now
hugh
s
also
lifted
their
bows
but
grey
dick
hissed
leave
them
to
me
this
is
fine
work
and
you
d
muddle
it
ere
the
words
had
ceased
to
echo
another
horse
was
down
then
as
those
who
remained
still
came
on
urged
by
the
knight
who
ran
shouting
behind
them
all
loosed
and
though
some
arrows
went
wide
the
end
of
it
was
that
ere
they
reached
the
little
mound
every
clavering
horse
was
dead
or
sore
wounded
while
on
the
heath
stood
or
lay
seven
helpless
men
now
said
grey
dick
let
us
go
and
talk
with
these
so
they
went
out
all
of
them
except
he
who
had
the
horses
and
hugh
called
aloud
that
the
first
man
of
the
claverings
who
lifted
a
bow
or
drew
a
sword
should
die
without
mercy
and
he
pointed
to
grey
dick
who
stood
beside
him
arrow
on
string
the
claverings
began
to
talk
together
excitedly
throw
down
your
weapons
commanded
hugh
still
they
hesitated
then
without
further
warning
dick
sent
an
artful
arrow
through
the
cap
of
one
of
them
lifting
it
from
his
head
and
instantly
set
another
shaft
to
his
string
after
this
down
went
the
swords
and
bows
daggers
and
knives
too
if
it
please
you
masters
then
these
followed
now
hugh
spoke
a
word
to
his
men
who
going
to
the
dead
and
dying
horses
took
from
them
the
and
and
therewith
bound
the
claverings
back
to
back
but
the
french
knight
in
acknowledgment
of
his
rank
they
trussed
up
by
himself
having
first
relieved
him
of
his
purse
by
way
of
fine
as
it
chanced
however
hugh
turned
and
saw
them
in
the
act
god
s
truth
would
you
make
common
thieves
of
us
he
said
angrily
their
weapons
and
harness
are
ours
by
right
of
war
but
i
ll
hunt
the
man
who
steals
their
money
out
of
my
so
the
purse
was
restored
when
it
was
safe
in
the
knight
s
pouch
again
hugh
saluted
him
begging
his
pardon
that
it
should
have
been
touched
but
how
are
you
named
sir
he
added
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
is
my
name
replied
the
knight
sadly
and
in
french
then
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
said
hugh
here
you
and
your
people
must
bide
until
some
come
to
set
you
free
which
as
this
place
is
lonely
and
little
crossed
in
winter
may
be
or
may
be
when
at
length
you
get
back
to
blythburgh
manor
however
or
to
dunwich
town
i
trust
it
to
your
honour
to
declare
that
hugh
de
cressi
has
dealt
well
with
you
for
whereas
he
might
have
slain
you
every
one
as
you
would
have
slain
him
and
his
if
you
could
he
has
harmed
no
hair
of
your
heads
as
for
your
horses
these
to
his
sorrow
he
was
obliged
to
kill
lest
they
should
be
used
to
ride
him
down
will
you
do
this
of
your
courtesy
ay
answered
the
knight
since
to
your
gentleness
we
owe
our
lives
but
with
your
leave
i
will
add
that
we
were
overcome
not
by
men
but
by
a
devil
and
he
nodded
toward
grey
dick
since
no
one
who
is
only
man
can
have
such
hellish
skill
in
archery
as
we
saw
yesterday
and
now
again
this
morning
moreover
he
went
on
contemplating
dick
s
ashen
hair
and
cold
eyes
set
wide
apart
in
the
rocky
face
like
to
those
of
a
suffolk
horse
the
man
s
air
shows
that
he
is
in
league
with
i
ll
not
render
your
words
into
our
english
talk
sir
pierre
replied
hugh
lest
he
of
whom
you
speak
should
take
them
amiss
and
send
you
where
you
might
learn
them
false
for
know
had
he
been
what
you
say
the
arrow
that
lies
in
your
horse
s
heart
would
have
nailed
the
breastplate
to
your
own
now
take
a
message
from
me
to
your
lord
sir
edmund
acour
the
traitor
tell
him
that
i
shall
return
ere
long
and
that
if
he
should
dare
to
attempt
ill
toward
the
lady
eve
who
is
my
betrothed
or
toward
my
father
and
brethren
or
any
of
my
house
i
promise
in
grey
dick
s
name
and
my
own
to
kill
him
or
those
who
may
aid
him
as
i
would
kill
a
forest
wolf
that
had
slunk
into
my
sheepfold
farewell
there
is
bracken
and
furze
yonder
where
you
may
lie
warm
till
some
pass
your
way
mount
men
so
they
rode
forward
bearing
all
the
clavering
weapons
with
them
which
a
mile
or
two
further
on
grey
dick
hid
in
an
empty
fox
s
earth
where
he
knew
he
could
find
them
again
only
he
kept
the
french
knight
s
beautiful
dagger
that
was
made
of
spanish
steel
inlaid
with
gold
and
used
it
to
his
life
s
end
here
it
may
be
told
that
it
was
not
until
hours
had
gone
by
as
hugh
learned
afterward
that
a
countryman
brought
this
knight
and
his
companions
more
dead
than
alive
to
dunwich
in
his
wain
as
he
was
travelling
across
westleton
heath
with
a
load
of
corn
to
be
ground
at
the
dunwich
mill
it
seemed
that
he
heard
voices
calling
feebly
and
guided
by
them
found
these
unhappy
men
half
buried
in
the
snow
that
had
fallen
on
that
day
and
so
rescued
them
from
death
but
when
sir
edmund
acour
knew
the
story
of
their
overthrow
and
of
the
message
that
hugh
had
sent
to
him
he
raved
at
them
and
especially
at
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
saying
that
the
worst
of
young
de
cressi
s
crimes
against
him
was
that
he
had
left
such
cowardly
hounds
alive
upon
the
earth
so
he
went
on
madly
till
sir
john
clavering
checked
him
bidding
him
wait
to
revile
these
men
until
he
and
not
his
horse
had
met
grey
dick
s
arrows
and
hugh
de
cressi
s
sword
for
he
added
it
may
happen
then
that
you
will
fare
no
better
than
they
have
done
or
than
did
john
my
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
after
they
left
dunwich
having
been
much
delayed
by
foul
weather
and
fouler
roads
hugh
de
cressi
and
his
company
came
at
length
to
london
they
had
suffered
no
further
adventure
on
their
way
for
though
the
times
were
rough
and
they
met
many
fellows
none
ventured
to
lift
hand
against
six
men
so
well
armed
and
sturdy
guided
by
one
of
their
number
who
had
often
been
to
london
on
master
de
cressi
s
business
they
rode
straight
to
westminster
having
stabled
their
horses
at
an
inn
near
by
and
cleaned
the
mire
of
the
road
from
their
mail
and
garments
they
went
up
to
the
palace
where
hugh
told
his
errand
to
an
officer
whom
he
found
on
duty
at
the
gate
then
it
is
a
fool
s
errand
said
the
captain
seeing
that
his
grace
rode
yesterday
to
his
castle
at
windsor
to
hunt
and
revel
and
will
be
gone
eight
days
at
the
then
to
windsor
i
must
follow
answered
hugh
chapter
v
grey
dick
shows
his
archery
so
sorely
did
the
horses
need
rest
that
hugh
and
his
people
could
not
ride
from
london
till
the
following
morning
and
evening
was
closing
in
before
they
found
themselves
drawing
near
the
gate
of
windsor
castle
in
the
of
the
little
town
they
pulled
rein
while
one
of
them
went
to
search
for
a
good
inn
at
which
they
might
lie
for
the
place
seemed
to
be
very
full
of
people
suddenly
as
they
stood
there
wondering
at
the
mighty
keep
which
towered
above
them
a
trumpet
was
blown
and
from
round
a
corner
appeared
a
gay
procession
of
men
and
with
them
some
ladies
who
carried
hawk
on
wrist
all
mounted
on
splendid
horses
now
the
people
who
had
gathered
to
study
the
strangers
or
tout
for
their
custom
took
off
their
bonnets
and
bent
low
saying
the
king
the
king
god
save
him
which
is
his
grace
asked
hugh
of
one
of
them
whereon
the
man
pointed
to
a
and
bearded
knight
still
in
early
middle
life
who
rode
toward
him
talking
to
a
gallant
youth
at
his
side
now
a
thought
came
into
hugh
s
mind
that
the
present
time
is
always
the
best
time
to
strike
leaping
from
his
horse
he
advanced
bowing
and
stood
in
the
pathway
of
the
king
seeing
this
two
of
the
fine
court
lords
spurred
their
horses
and
rode
straight
at
him
thinking
to
drive
him
back
but
he
held
his
ground
for
their
insolence
made
him
angry
and
catching
the
bridle
of
one
of
the
horses
threw
it
on
its
haunches
so
sharply
that
the
knight
who
rode
it
rolled
from
his
saddle
into
the
mire
whereupon
every
one
laughed
in
a
moment
he
was
on
his
feet
again
and
shouting
out
of
the
road
jackanapes
dressed
in
your
grandfather
s
mail
unless
you
would
stop
there
in
the
stocks
do
you
know
whose
path
you
block
that
of
his
grace
answered
hugh
for
whom
i
have
a
message
that
he
will
be
glad
to
hear
and
popinjay
this
for
yourself
were
it
not
for
his
presence
it
is
you
who
should
stop
upon
the
road
till
you
were
carried
now
noting
this
disturbance
the
king
spoke
to
the
youth
at
his
side
who
came
forward
and
said
in
a
pleasant
courteous
voice
addressing
hugh
sir
why
do
you
make
trouble
in
these
streets
and
tumble
the
good
sir
ambrose
lacey
from
his
horse
with
such
scant
ceremony
sir
answered
hugh
because
the
good
sir
ambrose
tried
to
ride
his
horse
over
me
for
no
offence
save
that
i
would
deliver
a
message
to
his
grace
which
he
will
wish
to
this
is
scarcely
a
time
for
the
giving
of
messages
replied
the
young
man
but
what
is
your
name
and
who
sends
the
message
i
am
the
prince
edward
he
added
modestly
so
you
may
speak
to
me
without
my
name
is
hugh
de
cressi
your
highness
and
i
am
sent
by
the
reverend
father
sir
andrew
arnold
of
dunwich
and
have
followed
his
grace
from
westminster
whither
i
and
my
men
rode
now
the
prince
went
to
the
king
and
spoke
to
him
and
returning
presently
said
my
father
says
that
he
knows
both
the
names
you
give
well
enough
and
holds
them
dear
he
bids
that
you
and
your
people
should
follow
him
to
the
castle
where
you
will
be
entertained
with
your
horses
sir
ambrose
he
added
the
king
desires
that
you
should
forget
your
choler
since
he
saw
what
passed
and
deems
that
this
young
stranger
did
well
to
check
your
horse
follow
on
hugh
de
cressi
the
officers
will
show
you
where
you
and
your
men
may
so
hugh
obeyed
and
rode
with
the
rest
of
the
train
and
his
folks
through
the
gates
of
windsor
castle
nor
did
they
do
so
unobserved
since
many
of
the
court
had
no
love
for
sir
ambrose
and
were
glad
to
see
him
tumbled
in
the
mire
after
they
had
stabled
their
beasts
as
hugh
followed
by
grey
dick
was
advancing
toward
a
hall
which
he
was
told
that
he
might
enter
an
officer
came
up
his
grace
desires
your
presence
before
you
sup
he
said
pointing
to
grey
dick
at
whom
the
officer
looked
doubtfully
hugh
asked
that
he
might
accompany
him
as
he
had
much
to
do
with
the
message
after
some
argument
they
were
led
through
various
passages
to
a
chamber
at
the
door
of
which
the
officer
wished
to
take
away
dick
s
bow
but
he
would
not
give
it
up
the
bow
and
i
do
not
part
he
said
in
his
croaking
voice
for
we
are
husband
and
wife
and
live
and
sleep
together
as
the
married
as
dick
spoke
the
door
was
opened
and
prince
edward
appeared
and
do
you
eat
together
also
good
fellow
he
asked
having
overheard
the
talk
ay
sir
we
feed
full
together
replied
dick
grimly
or
so
thought
some
on
blythburgh
marsh
a
few
days
i
should
like
to
hear
that
tale
said
the
prince
meanwhile
since
both
my
father
and
i
love
archers
let
him
pass
with
his
bow
only
keep
his
arrows
lest
it
should
happen
to
grow
hungry
then
they
entered
the
chamber
led
by
the
prince
it
was
a
fine
place
with
a
vaulted
stone
roof
and
windows
of
coloured
glass
that
looked
like
the
chancel
of
a
church
only
at
the
head
of
it
where
the
altar
should
have
been
was
a
kind
of
dais
on
this
dais
were
set
some
oaken
chairs
with
many
lanterns
behind
them
in
which
burned
tapers
that
together
with
a
great
wood
fire
gave
light
to
the
chamber
in
one
of
these
chairs
sat
a
gracious
lady
who
was
embroidering
something
silken
in
a
frame
this
was
queen
philippa
and
talking
to
her
stood
the
tall
king
clad
in
a
velvet
robe
lined
with
fur
behind
seated
at
a
little
table
on
which
lay
parchments
was
a
man
in
a
priest
s
robe
writing
there
was
no
one
else
in
the
room
hugh
and
dick
advanced
to
the
foot
of
the
dais
and
stood
there
bowing
who
are
these
asked
the
king
of
the
prince
oh
i
remember
the
man
who
overthrew
sir
ambrose
and
said
he
had
a
message
ay
sire
answered
the
prince
and

she
asked

her
soft
voice

of
the
colour
of
the
eyes
of
his
mistress
which
without
doubt
being
in
love
he
describes
falsely
on
with
the
letter
out
of
this
matter
continued
hugh
rose
a
feud
yesterday
during
which
hugh
de
cressi
killed
his
cousin
john
fighting
and
his
servant
richard
the
archer
who
accompanies
him
commonly
known
as

slew
three
men
with
as
many
arrows
two
of

being
normans
whose

are
unknown
to

and
the
third
a
grieve
to
sir
john

also
he

shaft
through

palm
of

george
said
the
king
but
here

shooting
were
they
near
to
you
grey
dick
not
so
far
away
sire
only
the
light
was
very
bad
or
i
should
have
had
the
fourth
i
aimed
low
sire
fearing
to
miss
his
skull
and
he
jerked
up
his
horse
s
head
to
take
the
a
good
trick
i
ve
played
it
myself
well
let
us
have
done
with
the
letter
and
then
we
ll
come
to
sire
read
on
hugh
i
ask
your
royal
pardon
to
hugh
de
cressi
and
richard
the
archer
for
these
slayings
believing
that
when
you
have
read
these
letters
it
will
be
that
remains
to
be
seen
muttered
the
king
sire
sir
edmund
acour
who
has
lands
here
in
suffolk
count
de
noyon
in
normandy
and
seigneur
of
cattrina
in
italy
i
know
the
man
exclaimed
edward
to
the
queen
and
so
do
you
a
handsome
knight
and
a
pleasant
but
one
of
whom
i
have
always
misdoubted
is
also
enamoured
of
eve
clavering
and
with
her
father
s
will
seeks
to
make
her
his
wife
though
she
hates
him
and
by
the
charter
of
dunwich
of
which
she
is
a
citizen
has
the
right
to
wed
whom
she
it
is
well
there
are
not
many
such
charters
the
old
story
brave
men
done
to
death
for
the
sake
of
a
woman
who
is
rightly
named
red
eve
mused
the
king
my
liege
i
pray
that
you
will
read
the
letter
herein
enclosed
hugh
de
cressi
will
tell
you
how
it
came
to
my
hand
since
i
lack
time
to
write
all
the
story
if
it
seems
good
to
your
grace
i
pray
you
scotch
this
snake
while
he
is
in
your
garden
lest
he
should
live
to
sting
you
when
you
walk
abroad
if
it
please
you
to
give
your
royal
warrant
to
the
bearer
of
this
letter
and
to
address
the
same
to
such
of
your
subjects
in
dunwich
as
you
may
think
good
i
doubt
not
but
that
men
can
be
found
to
execute
the
same
thus
would
a
great
and
traitorous
plot
be
brought
to
nothing
to
your
own
glory
and
the
discomfiture
of
your
foes
in
france
who
hope
to
lay
their
murderous
hands
upon
the
throne
of
england
your
humble
servant
and
subject
andrew
what
s
this
exclaimed
the
king
starting
from
his
seat
to
lay
hands
upon
the
throne
of
england
quick
with
the
other
letter
man
i
was
charged
that
it
is
for
your
grace
s
eye
alone
said
hugh
as
he
unfolded
the
paper
is
it
your
pleasure
that
i
read
it
aloud
if
i
can
for
it
is
writ
in
french
give
it
me
said
the
king
philippa
come
help
me
with
this
crabbed
then
they
withdrew
to
the
side
of
the
dais
and
standing
under
a
lantern
spelled
out
sir
edmund
acour
s
letter
to
the
duke
of
normandy
word
by
word
the
king
finished
the
letter
and
still
holding
it
in
his
hand
stood
for
a
minute
silent
then
his
rage
broke
out
he
of
england
he
quoted
that
s
your
husband
edward
lady
who
is
to
be
overthrown
and
killed
that
philip
s
son
may
take
his
seat
and
be
crowned
king
at
westminster
which
god
is
to
bring
about
before
this
year
is
out
yes
and
my
cities
are
to
be
sacked
and
my
people
slain
and
this
french
dog
edmund
acour
who
has
sworn
fealty
to
me
is
to
be
rewarded
with
wide
english
lands
and
high
english
titles
well
by
god
s
blood
i
swear
that
dead
or
living
he
shall
be
lifted
higher
than
he
hopes
though
not
by
normandy
or
my
brother
of
france
let
me
think
let
me
think
if
i
send
he
ll
hear
of
it
and
slip
away
did
not
good
old
sir
andrew
call
him
a
snake
now
where
s
this
girl
red
eve
in
sanctuary
sire
at
the
temple
church
in
dunwich
answered
hugh
ah
and
she
s
a
great
heiress
now
for
you
killed
her
brother
and
acour
although
he
has
wide
possessions
in
sundry
lands
was
ever
a
spendthrift
and
deep
in
debt
no
he
ll
not
leave
unless
he
can
get
the
girl
and
old
sir
andrew
will
guard
her
well
with
the
power
of
the
church
and
with
his
own
right
arm
if
need
be
for
he
s
still
more
knight
than
priest
so
there
s
no
hurry
tell
me
all
you
know
of
this
story
hugh
de
cressi
omitting
nothing
however
small
nay
have
no
fear
if
you
can
vouch
for
your
fellow
there
all
of
us
in
this
chamber
are
loyal
to
england
speak
out
so
hugh
began
and
told
of
the
de
cressis
and
the
claverings
and
their
feud
and
of
how
he
and
eve
had
always
loved
each
other
he
told
of
their
meeting
in
the
reeds
of
blythburgh
fen
and
of
the
death
of
john
de
clavering
at
his
hand
and
of
the
others
at
the
hand
of
grey
dick
and
of
the
escape
of
acour
from
the
fourth
arrow
he
told
how
he
and
eve
had
swum
the
blyth
in
flood
though
the
ice
cut
them
and
hid
on
the
moor
while
grey
dick
led
the
claverings
astray
and
came
at
last
safe
to
sanctuary
he
told
how
acour
s
letter
had
been
won
from
his
messenger
by
sir
andrew
s
loyal
guile
he
told
of
the
penance
that
sir
andrew
had
laid
upon
them
because
of
the
blood
of
john
clavering
of
the
flight
from
dunwich
and
the
shooting
of
the
horses
of
the
clavering
men
and
of
their
ride
to
london
and
to
windsor
he
told
everything
save
only
the
tale
of
what
sir
andrew
had
seen
in
the
house
of
murgh
in
far
cathay
when
at
last
he
had
finished
and
though
it
was
long
none
there
grew
weary
of
that
story
the
king
turned
to
the
clerk
and
said
brother
peter
make
out
a
full
pardon
to
hugh
de
cressi
of
dunwich
and
richard
archer
his
servant
for
all
slayings
or
other
deeds
wrought
by
them
contrary
to
our
general
peace
draw
it
wide
and
bring
the
same
to
me
for
execution
ere
i
sleep
make
out
a
commission
also
to
the
mayor
of
dunwich
nay
i
ll
think
that
matter
over
and
instruct
you
further
hugh
de
cressi
you
have
our
thanks
and
if
you
go
on
as
you
have
begun
you
shall
have
more
ere
long
for
i
need
such
men
about
me
you
also
strange
and
man
named
grey
dick
shall
not
lack
our
favour
if
it
proves
that
you
can
shoot
but
half
as
well
as
you
have
boasted
and
unless
you
lie
both
of
you
as
it
seems
that
you
have
done
and
now
to
supper
though
in
truth
this
news
does
not
kindle
appetite
son
see
that
this
gentleman
is
well
served
and
that
none
mock
him
more
about
the
fashion
of
his
armour
above
all
sir
ambrose
for
i
ll
not
suffer
it
plate
and
damascene
do
not
make
a
man
and
this
it
seems
was
borrowed
from
as
brave
ay
and
as
learned
a
knight
as
ever
bestrode
a
horse
in
war
come
lady
and
taking
the
queen
by
the
hand
he
left
the
chamber
that
evening
hugh
ate
his
food
seated
among
the
knights
of
the
household
at
a
high
table
in
the
great
hall
at
the
head
of
which
for
the
king
supped
in
private
was
placed
the
young
prince
edward
he
noted
that
now
none
laughed
at
him
about
the
fashion
of
his
mail
or
his
country
ways
indeed
when
after
supper
sir
ambrose
lacey
came
to
him
and
asked
his
pardon
for
the
talk
that
he
had
used
to
him
in
the
windsor
street
he
was
sure
that
some
word
had
been
sent
round
that
his
business
had
brought
him
favour
with
the
king
and
that
he
must
be
treated
with
all
courtesy
several
of
those
who
sat
round
him
tried
to
discover
what
that
business
was
but
of
this
he
would
say
nothing
parrying
their
questions
with
others
about
the
wars
in
france
and
listening
with
open
ears
to
the
tales
of
great
deeds
done
there
ah
would
that
i
could
see
such
things
he
said
to
which
one
of
them
answered
well
why
not
there
ll
be
chance
enough
ere
long
and
many
of
us
would
be
glad
of
a
square
built
like
now
at
lower
tables
in
that
vast
hall
hugh
s
servants
and
with
them
grey
dick
sat
among
the
of
the
king
s
guard
who
were
all
chosen
for
their
courage
and
skill
in
archery
these
soldiers
noting
the
fellow
who
ate
with
his
bow
resting
on
the
bench
beside
him
inquired
about
him
from
the
other
dunwich
men
and
soon
heard
enough
to
cause
them
to
open
their
eyes
when
the
ale
had
got
hold
of
them
they
opened
their
mouths
also
and
crowding
round
dick
asked
if
it
were
true
that
he
could
shoot
well
as
well
as
another
he
answered
and
would
say
no
more
then
they
looked
at
his
bow
and
saw
that
it
was
like
his
master
s
mail
and
of
some
foreign
make
and
wood
but
a
mighty
weapon
such
as
few
could
handle
and
hold
straight
lastly
they
began
to
challenge
him
to
a
match
upon
the
morrow
to
which
he
answered
who
also
had
been
drinking
ale
and
was
growing
angry
that
he
d
give
the
best
of
them
five
points
in
fifty
now
they
mocked
for
among
them
were
some
famous
archers
and
asked
at
what
range
at
any
ye
will
answered
grey
dick
from
twelve
score
yards
down
to
one
score
yards
now
trouble
me
no
longer
who
if
i
must
shoot
would
sleep
first
and
drink
no
more
of
your
strong
ale
that
breeds
bad
humours
in
one
reared
upon
dyke
then
seizing
his
bow
he
glided
away
in
his
curious
fashion
to
the
hole
where
he
had
been
shown
that
he
should
sleep
a
braggart
said
one
i
am
not
so
sure
answered
a
grizzled
captain
of
archers
who
had
fought
in
many
wars
braggarts
make
a
noise
but
this
fellow
only
spoke
when
we
squeezed
him
and
perhaps
what
came
out
of
those
thin
lips
was
truth
at
least
from
his
look
i
d
sooner
not
find
him
against
me
bow
to
then
they
fell
to
betting
which
of
them
would
beat
grey
dick
by
the
heaviest
points
next
morning
about
nine
o
clock
the
king
sent
a
messenger
to
hugh
bidding
him
and
his
servant
richard
wait
upon
them
they
went
with
this
messenger
who
led
them
to
a
little
chamber
where
his
grace
sat
attended
only
by
the
clerk
brother
peter
and
a
minister
whose
name
he
never
learned
hugh
de
cressi
and
richard
archer
said
edward
motioning
to
the
minister
to
hand
hugh
a
parchment
to
which
hung
a
great
seal
here
is
the
pardon
which
i
promised
you
no
need
to
stay
to
read
it
since
it
is
as
wide
as
windsor
keep
and
woe
betide
him
who
lifts
hand
against
either
of
you
for
aught
you
may
have
done
or
left
undone
in
the
past
contrary
to
the
laws
of
our
realm
yet
remember
well
that
this
grace
runs
not
to
the
future
now
that
matter
is
ended
and
we
come
to
one
that
is
greater
because
of
the
faith
put
in
you
by
our
loyal
and
beloved
subject
sir
andrew
arnold
your
godsire
and
because
we
like
the
fashion
of
you
hugh
de
cressi
and
hold
you
brave
and
honest
it
has
pleased
us
to
give
you
a
commission
under
which
we
direct
the
mayor
of
dunwich
and
all
true
and
lawful
men
of
that
town
and
hundred
to
aid
you
in
the
taking
or
if
need
be
in
the
slaying
of
our
subject
sir
edmund
acour
count
of
noyon
and
seigneur
of
cattrina
we
command
you
to
bring
this
man
before
us
alive
or
dead
that
his
cause
may
be
judged
of
our
courts
and
the
truth
of
the
matter
alleged
against
him
by
the
reverend
father
sir
andrew
arnold
therein
determined
nevertheless
we
command
you
not
to
wound
or
kill
the
said
knight
unless
he
resists
the
authority
of
us
by
you
conveyed
and
you
can
not
otherwise
hold
him
safe
from
escaping
from
out
this
our
realm
this
commission
you
will
presently
go
forth
to
execute
keeping
its
tenor
and
your
aim
secret
until
the
moment
comes
to
strike
and
as
you
perform
your
duty
of
which
you
will
return
and
make
report
to
us
so
shall
we
judge
and
reward
you
do
you
understand
sire
answered
hugh
bowing
i
understand
and
i
will
obey
to
my
last
good
when
the
parchments
are
engrossed
my
officer
here
will
read
them
to
you
and
explain
aught
that
may
need
it
meanwhile
we
have
an
hour
or
two
during
which
your
horses
can
eat
for
there
are
no
fresh
beasts
here
to
give
you
and
it
is
best
to
avoid
doubts
that
you
should
return
as
you
came
only
showing
your
powers
if
any
should
attempt
to
arrest
you
so
let
us
have
done
with
these
heavy
matters
and
disport
us
for
a
while
this
servant
of
yours
has
made
a
common
boast
that
he
will
outshoot
any
of
our
picked
archers
and
now
we
are
ready
to
go
forth
and
put
him
to
the
proof
of
the
butts
let
him
know
however
that
notwithstanding
our
words
of
yesterday
we
shall
not
hold
him
to
blame
if
he
fails
since
many
a
man
of
higher
degree
promises
more
at
night
than
he
can
perform
in
the
sire
i
ll
do
my
best
i
can
no
more
said
grey
dick
only
i
pray
that
none
may
be
suffered
to
hang
about
or
pester
me
at
the
butts
since
i
am
a
lonely
man
who
love
not
company
when
i
use
my
that
shall
be
so
said
the
king
and
now
to
the
the
sport
grumbled
grey
dick
when
he
and
hugh
were
alone
together
why
it
is
other
sport
we
should
be
seeking
with
acour
and
his
knaves
for
targets
go
to
the
king
master
and
show
him
that
while
we
linger
here
the
frenchman
may
slip
away
or
work
more
and
worse
i
can
not
dick
the
parchments
are
not
written
out
and
his
grace
is
bent
upon
this
pleasure
match
moreover
man
all
these
archers
here
yes
and
their
betters
also
would
say
that
you
had
fled
because
you
were
an
empty
boaster
who
dared
not
face
the
they
d
say
that
would
they
snarled
grey
dick
yes
they
d
say
that
which
would
be
bitter
hearing
for
you
and
me
well
they
shall
not
say
it
yet
i
tell
you
master
he
added
in
a
burst
of
words
although
i
know
not
why
i
d
rather
bear
their
scorn
and
be
away
on
the
road
to
it
may
not
be
dick
replied
hugh
shaking
his
head
doubtfully
see
here
they
come
to
fetch
in
a
glade
of
the
forest
of
windsor
situated
near
to
the
castle
and
measuring
some
score
yards
of
open
level
ground
stood
grey
dick
a
strange
uncouth
figure
at
whom
the
archers
of
the
guard
laughed
nudging
each
other
in
his
bony
hand
however
he
held
that
at
which
they
did
not
laugh
namely
the
great
black
bow
six
feet
six
inches
long
which
he
said
had
come
to
him
from
the
sea
and
was
fashioned
not
of
yew
but
of
some
heavy
wood
grown
perhaps
in
southern
or
even
in
far
eastern
lands
still
one
of
them
who
had
tried
to
draw
this
bow
to
his
ear
and
could
not
said
aloud
that
the
suffolk
man
would
do
naught
with
that
clumsy
whereat
grey
dick
who
heard
him
grinning
showing
his
white
teeth
like
an
angry
dog
near
by
on
horseback
and
on
foot
were
the
king
the
young
prince
edward
and
many
knights
and
ladies
while
on
the
other
side
stood
scores
of
soldiers
and
other
folk
from
the
castle
who
came
to
see
this
ugly
fellow
well
beaten
at
his
own
game
dick
whispered
hugh
shoot
now
as
you
never
shot
before
teach
them
a
lesson
for
the
honour
of
let
me
be
master
he
grumbled
i
told
you
i
would
do
my
then
he
sat
himself
down
on
the
grass
and
began
to
examine
his
arrows
one
by
one
to
all
appearance
taking
no
heed
of
anything
else
presently
came
the
first
test
at
a
distance
of
five
score
yards
was
set
a
little
clout
or
target
of
white
wood
not
more
than
two
feet
square
this
clout
had
a
red
mark
or
eye
three
inches
across
painted
in
its
centre
and
stood
not
very
high
above
the
sward
now
richard
said
the
king
three
of
the
best
archers
that
we
have
about
us
have
been
chosen
to
shoot
against
you
and
each
other
by
their
fellows
say
will
you
draw
first
or
last
last
sire
he
answered
that
i
may
know
their
then
a
man
stepped
forward
a
strong
and
gallant
looking
fellow
and
loosed
his
three
arrows
the
first
missed
the
clout
the
second
pierced
the
white
wood
and
the
third
hit
the
red
eye
the
clout
having
been
changed
and
the
old
one
brought
to
the
king
with
the
arrows
in
it
the
second
man
took
his
turn
this
time
all
three
of
the
arrows
hit
the
mark
one
of
them
being
in
the
red
again
it
was
changed
and
forth
came
the
great
archer
of
the
guard
a
tall
and
man
named
jack
green
and
whom
it
was
said
none
had
ever
beaten
he
drew
and
the
arrow
went
home
in
the
red
on
its
left
edge
he
drew
again
and
the
arrow
went
home
in
the
red
on
its
right
edge
he
drew
a
third
time
and
the
arrow
went
home
straight
in
the
very
centre
of
the
red
where
was
a
little
black
spot
now
a
great
laugh
went
up
since
clearly
the
suffolk
man
was
beaten
ere
ever
he
began
your
dick
may
do
as
well
he
can
do
no
better
said
the
king
when
the
target
was
brought
to
him
grey
dick
looked
at
it
a
boon
your
grace
said
dick
grant
that
this
clout
may
be
set
up
again
with
the
arrows
fast
any
may
know
them
from
mine
since
they
are
grey
whereas
those
i
make
are
black
for
i
am
a
fletcher
in
my
spare
hours
and
love
my
own
so
be
it
said
the
king
wondering
and
the
clout
was
replaced
upon
its
stand
now
grey
dick
stretched
himself
looked
at
the
clout
looked
at
his
bow
and
set
a
arrow
on
the
string
then
he
drew
it
seemed
but
lightly
and
carelessly
as
though
he
thought
the
distance
small
away
flew
the
shaft
and
sank
into
the
red
a
good
inch
within
the
leftmost
arrow
of
jack
green
ah
said
the
onlookers
a
lucky
shot
indeed
again
he
drew
and
again
the
arrow
sank
into
the
red
a
good
inch
within
the
rightmost
shot
of
jack
green
oh
said
the
onlookers
this
man
is
an
archer
but
jack
s
last
he
can
not
best
let
the
devil
help
him
how
he
in
the
devil
s
name
then
be
silent
wheezed
grey
dick
with
a
flash
of
his
eye
ay
be
silent
be
silent
said
the
king
we
do
not
see
such
shooting
every
now
dick
set
his
foot
apart
and
arrow
on
string
thrice
he
lifted
his
bow
and
thrice
let
it
sink
again
perhaps
because
he
felt
some
breath
of
wind
stir
the
still
air
a
fourth
time
he
lifted
and
drew
not
as
he
had
before
but
straight
to
the
ear
then
loosed
at
once
away
rushed
the
shaft
and
folk
noted
that
it
scarcely
seemed
to
rise
as
arrows
do
or
at
least
not
half
so
high
it
rushed
it
smote
and
there
was
silence
for
none
could
see
exactly
what
had
happened
then
he
who
stood
near
the
target
to
mark
ran
forward
and
screamed
out
by
god
s
name
he
has
shattered
jack
green
s
centre
arrow
and
shot
through
the
clout
then
from
all
sides
rose
the
old
archer
cry
he
he
he
while
the
young
prince
threw
his
cap
on
high
and
the
king
said
would
that
there
were
more
such
men
as
this
in
england
jack
green
it
seems
that
you
are
nay
said
grey
dick
seating
himself
again
upon
the
grass
there
is
naught
to
choose
between
us
in
this
round
what
next
your
grace
only
hugh
who
watched
him
saw
the
big
veins
swell
beneath
the
pale
skin
of
his
forehead
as
they
ever
did
when
he
was
moved
the
war
game
said
the
king
that
is
if
you
will
for
here
rough
knocks
may
be
going
set
it
out
one
of
then
a
captain
of
the
archers
explained
this
sport
in
short
it
was
that
man
should
stand
against
man
clad
in
leather
jerkins
and
wearing
a
vizor
to
protect
the
face
and
shoot
at
each
other
with
blunt
arrows
rubbed
with
chalk
he
who
first
took
what
would
have
been
a
mortal
wound
to
be
held
worsted
i
like
not
blunted
arrows
said
grey
dick
or
for
the
matter
of
that
any
other
arrows
save
my
own
against
how
many
must
i
play
the
three
the
captain
nodded
then
by
your
leave
i
will
take
them
all
at
now
some
said
that
this
was
not
fair
but
in
the
end
dick
won
his
point
and
those
archers
whom
he
had
beaten
among
them
jack
green
were
placed
against
him
standing
five
yards
apart
and
blunted
arrows
served
out
to
all
dick
set
one
of
them
on
the
string
and
laid
the
two
others
in
front
of
them
then
a
knight
rode
to
halfway
between
them
but
a
little
to
one
side
and
shouted
loose
as
the
word
struck
his
ear
dick
shot
with
wonderful
swiftness
and
almost
as
the
arrow
left
the
bow
flung
himself
down
grasping
another
as
he
fell
next
instant
three
shafts
whistled
over
where
he
had
stood
but
his
found
its
mark
on
the
body
of
him
at
whom
he
had
aimed
causing
the
man
to
stagger
backward
and
throw
down
his
bow
as
he
was
bound
to
do
if
hit
next
instant
dick
was
up
again
and
his
second
arrow
flew
striking
full
and
fair
before
ever
he
at
whom
it
was
aimed
had
drawn
now
there
remained
jack
green
alone
and
as
dick
set
the
third
arrow
but
before
he
could
draw
jack
green
shot
beat
said
dick
and
stood
quite
still
at
him
rushed
the
swift
shaft
and
passed
over
his
shoulder
within
a
hairbreadth
of
his
ear
then
came
dick
s
turn
on
jack
green
s
cap
was
an
archer
s
plume
mark
the
plume
lords
he
said
and
lo
the
feather
leapt
from
that
cap
now
there
was
silence
no
one
spoke
but
dick
drew
out
three
more
arrows
tell
me
captain
he
said
is
your
ground
marked
out
in
scores
and
what
is
the
farthest
that
any
one
of
you
has
sent
a
flighting
shot
ay
answered
the
officer
and
twenty
score
and
one
yard
is
the
farthest
nor
has
that
been
done
for
many
a
dick
steadied
himself
and
seemed
to
fill
his
lungs
with
air
then
stretching
his
long
arms
to
the
full
he
drew
the
great
bow
till
the
horns
looked
as
though
they
came
quite
close
together
and
loosed
high
and
far
flew
that
shaft
men
s
eyes
could
scarcely
follow
it
and
all
must
wait
long
before
a
man
came
running
to
say
where
it
had
fallen
twenty
score
and
two
yards
he
cried
not
much
to
win
by
grunted
dick
though
enough
i
have
done
twenty
and
one
score
once
but
that
was
somewhat
then
while
the
silence
still
reigned
he
set
the
second
arrow
on
the
string
and
waited
as
though
he
knew
not
what
to
do
presently
about
fifty
paces
from
him
a
wood
dove
flew
from
out
a
tree
and
as
such
birds
do
at
the
first
breath
of
spring
for
the
day
was
mild
and
sunny
hovered
a
moment
in
the
air
ere
it
dipped
toward
a
great
fir
where
doubtless
it
had
built
for
years
never
poor
fowl
was
it
destined
to
build
again
for
as
it
turned
its
beak
downward
dick
s
shaft
pierced
it
through
and
through
and
bore
it
onward
to
the
earth
still
in
the
midst
of
a
great
silence
dick
took
up
his
quiver
and
emptied
it
on
the
ground
then
gave
it
to
the
captain
of
the
archers
saying
and
you
will
step
sixty
nay
seventy
paces
and
set
this
mouth
upward
in
the
grass
where
a
man
may
see
it
the
captain
did
so
propping
the
quiver
straight
with
stones
and
a
bit
of
wood
then
having
studied
all
things
with
his
eyes
dick
shot
upward
but
softly
making
a
gentle
curve
the
arrow
turned
in
the
air
as
it
drew
near
the
quiver
and
fell
into
its
mouth
striking
it
flat
ill
done
grumbled
dick
had
i
shot
well
it
should
have
been
pinned
to
earth
well
yon
shadow
baulked
me
and
it
might
have
been
then
he
unstrung
his
bow
and
slipped
it
into
its
case
now
at
length
the
silence
was
broken
and
in
good
earnest
men
especially
those
of
dunwich
screamed
and
shouted
hurling
up
their
caps
jack
green
for
all
jealousy
was
forgotten
at
the
sight
of
this
wondrous
skill
ran
to
dick
clasped
him
in
his
arms
and
dragging
the
badge
from
off
his
breast
tried
to
pin
it
to
his
rough
doublet
the
young
prince
came
and
clapped
him
on
the
shoulder
saying
be
my
man
be
my
man
but
dick
only
growled
paws
off
what
have
i
done
that
i
have
not
done
a
score
of
times
before
with
no
fine
folk
to
watch
me
i
shot
to
please
my
master
and
for
the
honour
of
suffolk
not
for
you
and
because
some
dogs
keep
their
tails
too
tightly
a
sulky
fellow
said
the
prince
but
by
heaven
i
like
him
then
the
king
pushed
his
horse
through
the
throng
and
all
fell
back
before
his
grace
richard
archer
he
said
never
has
such
marksmanship
as
yours
been
seen
in
england
since
we
sat
upon
the
throne
nor
shall
it
go
unrewarded
the
twenty
angels
that
you
said
you
would
stake
last
night
shall
be
paid
to
you
by
the
treasurer
of
our
household
moreover
here
is
a
gift
from
edward
of
england
the
friend
of
archers
that
you
may
be
pleased
to
wear
and
taking
his
velvet
cap
from
off
his
head
the
king
unpinned
from
it
a
golden
arrow
of
which
the
barbed
head
was
cut
from
a
ruby
and
gave
it
to
him
i
thank
you
sire
said
dick
his
pale
skin
flushing
with
pride
and
pleasure
i
ll
wear
it
while
i
live
and
may
the
sight
of
it
mean
death
to
many
of
your
without
doubt
it
will
and
that
ere
long
richard
for
know
you
that
soon
we
sail
again
for
france
whence
the
tempest
held
us
back
and
it
is
my
pleasure
that
you
sail
with
us
therefore
i
name
you
one
of
our
fletchers
with
place
about
our
person
in
our
bodyguard
of
archers
jack
green
will
show
you
your
quarters
and
instruct
you
in
your
duties
and
soon
you
shall
match
your
skill
against
his
again
but
next
time
with
frenchmen
for
your
sire
said
dick
very
slowly
take
back
your
arrow
for
i
can
not
do
as
you
why
man
are
you
a
frenchman
asked
the
king
angrily
for
he
was
not
wont
to
have
his
favours
thus
refused
my
mother
never
told
me
so
sire
although
i
don
t
know
for
certain
who
my
father
may
have
been
still
i
think
not
since
i
hate
the
sight
of
that
breed
as
a
farmer
s
dog
hates
rats
but
sire
i
have
a
good
master
and
do
not
wish
to
change
him
for
one
who
saving
your
presence
may
prove
a
worse
since
king
s
favour
on
monday
has
been
known
to
mean
king
s
halter
on
tuesday
did
you
not
promise
to
whip
me
round
your
walls
last
night
unless
i
shot
as
well
as
i
thought
i
could
and
now
do
you
not
change
your
face
and
give
me
golden
arrows
at
these
bold
words
a
roar
of
laughter
went
up
from
all
who
heard
them
in
which
the
king
himself
joined
heartily
enough
silence
he
cried
presently
this
yeoman
s
tongue
is
as
sharp
as
his
shafts
i
am
pierced
let
us
hear
whom
he
will
hit
you
again
sire
i
think
went
on
dick
because
after
the
fashion
of
kings
you
are
unjust
you
praise
me
for
my
shooting
whereas
you
should
praise
god
seeing
that
it
is
no
merit
of
mine
but
a
gift
he
gave
me
at
my
birth
in
place
of
much
which
he
withheld
moreover
my
master
there
and
he
pointed
to
hugh
who
has
just
done
you
better
service
than
hitting
a
clout
in
the
red
and
a
dow
beneath
the
wing
you
forget
altogether
though
i
tell
you
he
can
shoot
almost
as
well
as
i
for
i
taught
dick
dick
broke
in
hugh
in
an
agony
of
shame
taking
no
heed
dick
went
on
imperturbably
and
is
the
best
man
with
a
sword
in
suffolk
as
the
ghost
of
john
clavering
knows
lastly
sire
you
send
this
master
of
mine
upon
a
certain
business
where
straight
arrows
may
be
wanted
as
well
as
sharp
swords
and
yet
you
d
keep
me
here
whittling
them
out
of
ashwood
who
if
i
could
have
had
my
will
would
have
been
on
the
road
these
two
hours
gone
is
that
a
king
s
wisdom
by
george
exclaimed
edward
i
think
that
i
should
make
you
councillor
as
well
as
fletcher
since
without
doubt
man
you
have
a
bitter
wit
and
what
is
more
rare
do
not
fear
to
speak
the
truth
as
you
see
it
moreover
in
this
matter
you
see
it
well
go
with
hugh
de
cressi
on
the
business
which
i
have
given
him
to
do
and
when
it
is
finished
should
both
or
either
of
you
live
neglect
not
our
command
to
rejoin
us
here
or
if
we
have
crossed
the
sea
in
france
edward
of
england
needs
the
service
of
such
a
sword
and
such
a
you
shall
have
them
both
sire
broke
in
hugh
for
what
they
are
worth
moreover
i
pray
your
grace
be
not
angry
with
grey
dick
s
words
for
if
god
gave
him
a
quick
eye
he
also
gave
him
a
rough
not
i
hugh
de
cressi
for
know
we
love
what
is
rough
if
it
be
also
honest
it
is
smooth
false
words
of
treachery
that
we
hate
such
words
as
are
ever
on
the
lips
of
one
whom
we
send
you
forth
to
bring
to
his
account
now
to
your
duty
farewell
till
we
meet
again
whether
it
be
here
or
where
all
men
true
or
traitors
must
foot
their
bill
at
chapter
vi
the
snare
about
noon
of
the
day
on
which
hugh
and
his
company
had
ridden
for
london
another
company
entered
dunwich
namely
sir
john
clavering
and
many
of
his
folk
though
with
him
were
neither
sir
edmund
acour
nor
any
of
his
french
train
sir
john
s
temper
had
never
been
of
the
best
for
he
was
a
man
who
whatever
his
prosperity
found
life
hard
and
made
it
harder
for
all
those
about
him
but
seldom
had
he
been
angrier
than
he
was
this
day
when
his
rage
was
mingled
with
real
sorrow
for
the
loss
of
his
only
son
slain
in
a
fight
brought
about
by
the
daughter
of
one
of
them
and
the
sister
of
the
other
and
urged
for
honour
s
sake
by
himself
the
father
of
them
both
moreover
the
marriage
on
which
he
had
set
his
heart
between
eve
and
the
glittering
french
lord
whose
future
seemed
so
great
had
been
brought
to
naught
and
this
turbulent
eve
had
fled
into
sanctuary
her
lover
too
the
youngest
son
of
a
merchant
had
ridden
away
to
london
doubtless
upon
some
mission
which
boded
no
good
to
him
or
his
leaving
a
blood
feud
behind
him
between
the
wealthy
de
cressis
and
all
the
clavering
kin
there
was
but
one
drop
of
comfort
in
his
cup
by
now
as
he
hoped
hugh
and
his
death
grey
dick
a
spawn
of
satan
that
all
the
country
feared
and
who
men
said
was
a
de
cressi
bastard
by
a
witch
were
surely
slain
or
taken
by
those
who
followed
upon
their
heels
sir
john
rode
to
the
preceptory
and
hammered
fiercely
on
its
oaken
door
presently
it
was
opened
by
sir
andrew
arnold
himself
who
stood
in
the
entrance
grey
and
grim
a
long
sword
girt
about
his
loins
and
armour
gleaming
beneath
his
monkish
robe
what
would
you
sir
john
clavering
that
you
knock
at
this
holy
house
thus
rudely
he
asked
my
daughter
priest
who
they
say
has
sheltered
they
say
well
knight
she
has
sheltered
here
beneath
the
wings
of
mary
and
john
begone
and
leave
her
in
i
make
no
more
of
such
wings
than
if
they
were
those
of
farmyard
geese
roared
the
furious
man
bring
her
or
i
will
pluck
her
do
so
replied
sir
andrew
if
you
live
to
pass
this
consecrated
sword
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
its
hilt
take
with
her
also
the
curse
of
the
mother
of
god
and
his
beloved
apostle
and
that
of
the
whole
church
of
christ
by
me
declared
upon
your
head
in
this
world
and
upon
your
soul
in
the
world
to
come
man
this
is
sanctuary
and
if
you
dare
to
set
foot
within
it
in
violence
may
your
body
perish
and
your
soul
scorch
everlastingly
in
the
fires
of
hell
and
you
he
added
raising
his
voice
till
it
rang
like
a
trumpet
addressing
the
followers
of
sir
john
on
you
also
let
the
curse
of
excommunication
fall
now
slay
me
and
enter
if
you
will
but
then
every
drop
of
blood
in
these
veins
shall
find
a
separate
tongue
and
cry
out
for
vengeance
on
you
before
the
judgment
seat
of
god
where
presently
i
summon
you
to
meet
then
he
crossed
himself
drew
the
great
sword
and
holding
it
in
his
left
hand
stretched
out
his
right
toward
them
in
malediction
the
clavering
men
heard
and
saw
they
looked
at
each
other
and
as
though
by
common
consent
turned
and
rode
away
crossing
themselves
also
in
truth
they
had
no
stomach
for
the
curse
of
the
church
when
it
was
thundered
forth
from
the
lips
of
such
a
monk
as
sir
andrew
arnold
who
they
knew
well
had
been
one
of
the
greatest
and
holiest
warriors
of
his
generation
and
so
said
rumour
was
a
white
wizard
to
boot
with
all
the
magic
of
the
east
at
his
command
your
men
have
gone
sir
john
said
the
old
priest
will
you
follow
them
or
will
you
enter
now
fear
drove
out
the
knight
s
rage
and
he
spoke
in
another
voice
sir
andrew
why
do
you
bring
all
these
wrongs
upon
me
my
boy
is
dead
at
the
hand
of
hugh
de
cressi
your
godson
and
he
has
robbed
me
of
my
daughter
whom
i
have
affianced
to
a
better
and
a
nobler
man
now
you
give
her
sanctuary
and
threaten
me
with
the
curse
of
the
church
because
i
would
claim
her
my
own
flesh
and
blood
ay
and
my
heiress
too
tell
me
as
one
man
to
another
why
do
you
do
these
things
and
tell
me
sir
john
clavering
why
for
the
sake
of
pelf
and
of
honours
that
you
will
never
harvest
do
you
seek
to
part
those
who
love
each
other
and
whom
god
has
willed
to
bring
together
why
would
you
sell
your
child
to
a
gilded
knave
whom
she
hates
nay
stop
me
not
i
d
call
him
that
and
more
to
his
face
and
none
have
ever
known
me
lie
why
did
you
suffer
this
frenchman
or
your
dead
son
or
both
of
them
to
try
to
burn
out
hugh
de
cressi
and
red
eve
as
though
they
were
rats
in
rubbish
would
you
know
father
then
i
ll
tell
you
because
i
wish
to
see
my
daughter
set
high
among
lords
and
princes
and
not
the
wife
of
a
merchant
s
lad
who
by
law
may
wear
cloth
only
and
rabbit
fur
because
also
i
hate
him
and
all
his
kin
and
if
this
is
true
of
yesterday
how
much
more
true
is
it
now
that
he
has
killed
my
son
and
by
the
arrows
of
that
who
dogs
his
heels
slain
my
guests
and
my
grieve
think
not
i
ll
rest
till
i
have
vengeance
of
him
and
all
his
cursed
house
i
ll
appeal
to
the
king
and
if
he
will
not
give
me
justice
i
ll
take
it
for
myself
ay
though
you
are
old
i
tell
you
you
shall
live
to
see
the
de
cressi
vault
crowded
with
the
de
cressi
sir
andrew
hid
his
eyes
for
a
moment
with
his
hand
then
let
it
fall
and
spoke
in
a
changed
voice
it
comes
upon
me
that
you
speak
truth
sir
john
for
since
i
met
a
certain
great
master
in
the
east
at
times
i
have
a
gift
of
foresight
i
think
that
much
sorrow
draws
near
this
land
ay
and
others
i
think
that
many
vaults
and
many
churchyards
too
will
ere
long
be
filled
with
dead
also
that
the
tomb
of
the
claverings
at
blythburgh
will
soon
be
opened
mayhap
the
end
of
this
world
draws
near
to
all
men
as
surely
it
draws
near
to
you
and
me
i
know
not
yet
truth
was
in
your
lips
just
now
and
in
mine
as
well
i
think
oh
man
man
he
went
on
after
a
pause
appeal
not
unto
the
world
s
cæsar
lest
cæsar
render
different
judgment
to
that
which
you
desire
get
you
home
and
on
your
knees
appeal
unto
god
to
forgive
you
your
proud
heart
sickness
draws
near
to
you
death
draws
near
to
you
and
after
death
hell
or
heaven
i
have
as
he
heard
these
words
sir
john
s
swarthy
face
grew
pale
and
for
a
little
while
his
rage
died
down
then
it
flared
up
again
don
t
dream
to
frighten
me
with
your
spells
old
wizard
he
said
i
m
a
hale
man
yet
though
i
do
lose
my
breath
at
times
when
my
mind
is
vexed
with
wrongs
and
i
ll
square
my
own
account
with
god
without
your
help
or
counsel
so
you
ll
not
give
me
my
daughter
nay
here
she
bides
in
sanctuary
for
so
long
as
it
shall
please
does
she
in
truth
perhaps
you
married
her
to
this
merchant
fellow
ere
he
rode
this
nay
sir
john
they
betrothed
themselves
before
the
altar
and
in
presence
of
his
kin
no
more
moreover
if
you
would
know
because
of
your
son
s
blood
which
runs
between
them
i
after
thought
and
prayer
speaking
in
the
name
of
the
church
swore
them
to
this
penance
that
for
a
year
from
yesterday
they
should
not
wed
nor
play
the
part
of
i
thank
you
priest
for
this
small
grace
answered
sir
john
with
a
bitter
laugh
and
in
my
turn
i
swear
this
that
after
the
year
they
shall
not
wed
since
the
one
of
them
will
be
clay
and
the
other
the
wife
of
the
man
whom
i
have
chosen
now
play
no
tricks
on
me
lest
i
burn
this
sanctuary
of
yours
about
your
head
and
throw
your
old
carcass
to
roast
among
the
sir
andrew
made
no
reply
only
resting
his
long
sword
on
the
threshold
he
leant
upon
its
hilt
and
fixed
his
clear
grey
eyes
upon
clavering
s
face
what
sir
john
saw
in
those
eyes
he
never
told
but
it
was
something
which
scared
him
at
least
that
shortening
of
the
breath
of
which
he
had
spoken
seemed
to
take
a
hold
of
him
for
he
swayed
upon
his
horse
as
though
he
were
about
to
fall
then
recovering
turned
and
rode
straight
for
blythburgh
it
was
the
second
night
after
that
day
when
sir
andrew
had
looked
john
clavering
in
the
eyes
secretly
and
in
darkness
those
three
whom
grey
dick
had
killed
were
borne
into
the
nave
of
blythburgh
church
and
there
laid
in
the
grave
which
had
been
made
ready
for
them
till
now
their
corpses
had
been
kept
above
ground
in
the
hope
that
the
body
of
john
clavering
the
younger
might
be
added
to
their
number
but
search
as
they
would
upon
seashore
and
nothing
of
him
was
ever
seen
again
this
funeral
was
celebrated
in
the
darkness
since
neither
sir
john
nor
acour
desired
that
all
men
should
see
three
bodies
that
had
been
slain
by
one
archer
aided
by
a
merchant
s
lad
standing
alone
against
a
score
and
know
to
say
naught
of
the
wounded
that
there
was
yet
another
to
be
added
to
the
tale
therefore
they
interred
them
by
night
with
no
notice
of
the
ceremony
it
was
a
melancholy
scene
the
nave
of
the
great
church
lighted
only
with
the
torches
borne
by
the
six
monks
of
the
black
augustines
from
the
neighbouring
priory
of
osyth
the
candles
little
stars
of
light
burning
far
away
upon
the
altar
the
bearers
of
the
household
of
the
claverings
and
the
uncoffined
corpses
lying
on
their
biers
by
the
edge
of
the
yawning
graves
the
mourners
in
their
mail
the
low
voice
of
the
celebrating
priest
a
frenchman
father
nicholas
chaplain
to
acour
who
hurried
through
the
latin
service
as
though
he
wished
to
be
done
with
it
the
deep
shadows
of
the
groined
roof
whereon
the
rain
pattered
such
were
the
features
of
this
interment
it
was
done
at
last
and
the
poor
dead
but
a
few
days
before
so
full
of
vigour
and
of
passion
were
left
to
their
last
sleep
in
the
unremembered
grave
then
the
mourners
marched
back
to
the
manor
across
the
middle
marsh
and
sought
their
beds
in
a
sad
silence
shortly
after
daybreak
they
were
called
from
them
again
by
the
news
that
those
who
had
followed
hugh
de
cressi
had
returned
quickly
they
rose
thinking
that
these
came
back
with
tidings
of
accomplished
vengeance
to
find
themselves
face
to
face
with
seven
starved
and
miserable
men
who
all
their
horses
being
dead
had
walked
hither
from
dunwich
the
wretched
story
was
learned
at
length
and
then
followed
that
violent
scene
which
has
been
told
already
when
acour
cursed
his
followers
as
cowards
and
clavering
sobered
perhaps
by
the
sadness
of
the
midnight
burial
or
by
the
memory
of
arnold
s
words
reproved
him
lastly
stung
by
the
taunts
that
were
heaped
upon
them
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
gave
hugh
s
message
that
if
they
lifted
hand
against
his
love
or
his
house
he
would
kill
them
like
ravening
wolves
which
i
think
he
certainly
will
do
for
none
can
conquer
him
and
his
henchman
he
added
shortly
then
sir
john
s
rage
flared
up
again
like
fire
when
fresh
fuel
is
thrown
on
ashes
he
cursed
hugh
and
grey
dick
he
cursed
his
daughter
he
even
cursed
acour
and
asked
for
the
second
time
how
it
came
about
that
he
who
had
brought
all
this
trouble
on
him
was
given
the
evil
name
of
traitor
i
know
not
answered
sir
edmund
fiercely
and
laying
his
hand
upon
his
sword
but
this
i
know
that
you
or
any
man
will
do
well
not
to
repeat
it
if
you
value
do
you
threaten
me
asked
sir
john
because
if
so
you
will
do
well
to
begone
out
of
this
house
of
shame
and
woe
lest
you
be
borne
out
feet
first
nay
nay
i
forgot
he
added
slowly
clasping
his
head
in
his
hands
you
are
my
daughter
s
affianced
are
you
not
and
will
give
her
high
place
and
many
famous
titles
and
her
son
shall
be
called
clavering
that
the
old
name
may
not
die
but
be
great
in
england
in
france
and
in
italy
you
must
bide
to
marry
her
lest
that
cuckoo
hugh
de
cressi
that
cuckoo
with
the
sharp
bill
should
creep
into
my
nest
i
ll
not
be
worsted
by
a
stripling
clad
in
merchant
s
cloth
who
slew
my
only
son
take
not
my
words
ill
noble
noyon
for
i
am
overdone
with
grief
for
the
past
and
fear
for
the
future
you
must
bide
to
marry
her
by
fair
means
or
by
foul
draw
her
from
the
sanctuary
and
marry
her
whether
she
say
you
yea
or
nay
you
have
my
leave
noble
noyon
and
so
speaking
he
swayed
and
fell
prone
upon
the
floor
at
first
they
thought
that
he
was
dead
but
the
chaplain
nicholas
who
was
a
leech
bled
him
and
he
came
to
himself
again
although
he
still
wandered
in
his
talk
and
lay
abed
then
acour
and
nicholas
took
counsel
together
what
is
to
be
done
said
sir
edmund
for
i
am
on
fire
for
this
maid
and
all
her
scorn
and
hate
do
but
fan
my
flame
moreover
she
is
now
very
rich
for
that
old
can
not
live
long
his
violent
humours
will
kill
him
and
as
you
know
father
although
i
have
great
possessions
my
costs
are
large
and
i
have
still
greater
debts
lastly
shall
de
noyon
and
his
knights
be
worsted
by
a
s
younger
son
a
mere
prentice
lad
and
his
henchman
a
common
archer
of
the
fens
show
me
how
to
get
her
nicholas
and
i
ll
make
an
abbot
of
you
yet
this
sanctuary
now
will
it
hold
if
we
stormed
the
place
and
took
her
would
the
holy
father
give
us
absolution
do
you
think
no
my
lord
answered
the
nicholas
the
church
is
great
because
the
church
is
one
and
what
the
priest
does
the
pope
upholds
especially
when
that
priest
is
no
mean
man
this
holy
monk
sir
andrew
arnold
has
reputation
throughout
europe
and
though
he
seems
so
humble
because
of
his
wisdom
is
in
the
counsel
of
many
great
men
whose
fathers
or
grandfathers
were
guided
by
him
long
ago
commit
what
crime
you
will
dip
yourself
to
the
lips
in
blood
and
you
may
find
forgiveness
but
touch
not
an
ancient
and
acknowledged
sanctuary
of
the
church
since
for
this
offence
there
will
be
what
then
nicholas
must
i
give
up
the
chase
and
fly
to
speak
truth
things
seem
to
threaten
me
why
has
that
hugh
twice
called
me
traitor
have
any
of
my
letters
fallen
into
strange
hands
think
you
i
have
written
several
and
you
know
my
mission
it
is
possible
lord
all
things
are
possible
but
i
think
not
i
think
that
he
only
draws
the
bow
at
a
hazard
which
is
more
than
grey
dick
does
he
added
with
a
chuckle
these
brute
english
hate
us
french
whom
they
know
to
be
their
masters
in
all
that
makes
a
man
and
traitor
to
their
fool
king
is
the
least
of
the
words
they
throw
at
well
priest
my
mother
was
english
as
my
wife
will
be
therefore
stay
your
tongue
on
that
matter
and
tell
me
how
i
am
to
make
her
my
wife
answered
acour
haughtily
the
chaplain
cringed
and
bowed
rubbing
his
thin
hands
together
i
thought
you
wished
to
speak
of
the
english
my
lord
otherwise
i
should
not
have
ventured
but
as
to
the
lady
eve
something
comes
to
me
why
does
she
stay
in
sanctuary
who
herself
has
committed
no
crime
is
it
not
such
is
her
madness
because
she
would
be
out
of
reach
of
you
and
your
endearments
now
if
she
believed
you
gone
far
enough
away
let
us
say
to
france
and
knew
that
her
father
lay
ill
why
then
and
he
paused
you
mean
that
she
might
come
out
of
sanctuary
of
her
own
accord
yes
lord
and
we
might
set
a
springe
to
catch
this
bird
so
rare
and
shy
and
though
she
d
flutter
flutter
flutter
and
peck
peck
peck
what
could
she
do
when
you
smoothed
her
plumage
with
your
loving
hand
and
a
priest
was
waiting
to
say
the
word
that
should
cause
her
to
forget
her
doubts
and
that
merchant
bumpkin
ah
nicholas
you
have
a
good
wit
and
if
all
goes
well
you
shall
certainly
be
an
abbot
but
would
her
father
do
you
think
lord
that
knight
is
in
such
a
rage
that
he
would
do
anything
what
did
he
say
just
before
the
stroke
took
him
that
you
were
to
marry
her
by
fair
means
or
by
foul
yes
and
he
told
me
an
hour
ago
that
if
only
he
knew
she
was
your
wife
he
would
die
happy
oh
you
have
his
warrant
for
anything
you
do
to
bring
about
this
end
still
there
is
no
need
to
tell
him
too
much
lest
it
should
cause
his
good
name
to
be
aspersed
by
the
vulgar
many
it
seems
love
this
red
eve
for
her
high
spirit
and
are
friends
to
the
de
cressis
an
race
who
know
how
to
bind
folk
to
them
listen
how
it
must
be
that
day
it
was
given
out
that
sir
edmund
acour
those
of
his
knights
who
remained
alive
and
all
his
following
were
about
to
leave
for
london
and
lay
their
cause
before
the
king
having
learned
that
hugh
de
cressi
had
gone
thither
to
prejudice
his
grace
on
his
own
behalf
it
was
added
moreover
that
they
would
not
return
to
suffolk
but
proposed
when
they
had
found
justice
or
the
promise
of
it
to
take
ship
at
dover
for
france
next
morning
accordingly
they
rode
away
from
blythburgh
manor
and
passed
through
dunwich
with
much
pomp
where
the
citizens
of
that
town
who
were
friends
of
the
de
cressis
stared
at
them
with
no
kind
eyes
indeed
one
of
these
as
they
crossed
the
called
to
them
to
be
careful
not
to
meet
hugh
de
cressi
and
grey
dick
upon
their
journey
lest
there
should
be
more
midnight
burials
and
turned
into
whereat
all
about
him
laughed
rudely
but
acour
did
not
laugh
he
ground
his
teeth
and
said
into
the
ear
of
nicholas
register
this
vow
for
me
priest
that
in
payment
for
that
jest
i
ll
sack
and
burn
dunwich
when
our
army
comes
and
give
its
men
and
children
to
the
sword
and
its
women
to
the
it
shall
be
done
lord
answered
the
chaplain
and
should
your
heart
soften
at
the
appointed
time
i
ll
put
you
in
memory
of
this
solemn
at
the
great
house
of
the
mayor
of
dunwich
sir
edmund
drew
rein
and
demanded
to
see
him
presently
this
mayor
a
timid
man
came
in
his
robes
of
office
and
asked
anxiously
what
might
be
the
cause
of
this
message
and
why
an
armed
band
halted
at
his
gate
for
no
ill
purpose
sir
answered
acour
though
little
of
justice
have
i
found
at
your
hands
who
therefore
must
seek
it
at
the
court
of
my
liege
lord
king
edward
all
i
ask
of
you
is
that
you
will
cause
this
letter
to
be
delivered
safely
to
the
lady
eve
clavering
who
lies
in
sanctuary
at
the
preceptory
of
mary
and
john
it
is
one
of
farewell
since
it
seems
that
this
lady
who
by
her
own
will
and
her
father
s
was
my
affianced
wishes
to
break
troth
and
i
am
not
a
man
who
needs
an
unwilling
bride
i
d
deliver
it
myself
only
that
old
knave
half
priest
and
half
knight
but
neither
good
you
d
best
speak
no
ill
of
sir
andrew
arnold
here
said
a
voice
in
the
crowd
only
the
master
of
the
preceptory
went
on
acour
changing
his
tone
somewhat
might
take
fright
and
think
i
wished
to
violate
his
sanctuary
if
i
came
there
with
thirty
spears
at
my
and
no
fool
either
said
the
voice
seeing
that
they
are
french
spears
and
his
is
an
english
therefore
continued
acour
i
pray
you
deliver
the
letter
perchance
when
we
meet
again
master
mayor
he
added
with
a
venomous
glance
of
his
dark
eyes
you
will
have
some
boon
to
ask
of
me
and
be
sure
i
ll
grant
it
if
i
then
without
waiting
for
an
answer
for
the
mob
of
sturdy
fishermen
many
of
whom
had
served
in
the
french
wars
looked
threatening
he
and
his
following
rode
away
through
the
ipswich
gate
and
out
on
to
the
moorlands
beyond
which
some
of
them
knew
but
too
well
all
the
rest
of
that
day
they
rode
slowly
but
when
night
came
having
halted
their
horses
at
a
farm
and
given
it
out
that
they
meant
to
push
on
to
woodbridge
they
turned
up
a
on
the
lonely
heath
and
unseen
by
any
made
their
through
the
darkness
to
a
certain
empty
house
in
the
marshes
not
far
from
beccles
town
this
house
called
frog
hall
was
part
of
acour
s
estate
and
because
of
the
ague
prevalent
there
in
autumn
had
been
long
unattended
nor
did
any
visit
it
at
this
season
of
the
year
when
no
cattle
grazed
upon
these
salt
marshes
here
then
he
and
his
people
lay
hid
cursing
their
fortunes
since
notwithstanding
the
provisions
that
they
had
conveyed
thither
in
secret
the
place
was
icy
cold
in
the
bitter
easterly
winds
which
tore
over
it
from
the
sea
so
lonely
was
it
also
that
the
frenchmen
swore
that
their
comrades
slain
by
grey
dick
haunted
them
at
nights
bidding
them
prepare
to
join
the
number
of
the
dead
indeed
had
not
acour
vowed
that
he
would
hang
the
first
man
who
attempted
to
desert
some
of
them
would
have
left
him
to
make
the
best
of
their
way
back
to
france
for
always
as
they
crouched
by
the
smoking
hearth
they
dreamed
of
grey
dick
and
his
terrible
arrows
sir
edmund
acour
s
letter
came
safely
into
the
hands
of
eve
brought
to
her
by
the
mayor
himself
it
read
thus
lady
you
will
no
more
of
me
so
however
much
you
should
live
to
ask
it
i
will
have
no
more
of
you
i
go
hang
your
merchant
lout
and
afterward
away
to
france
who
wish
to
have
done
with
your
cold
suffolk
where
you
may
buy
my
lands
cheap
if
you
will
yet
should
master
hugh
de
cressi
chance
to
escape
me
i
counsel
you
to
marry
him
for
i
can
wish
you
no
worse
fate
seeing
what
you
will
be
than
to
remember
what
you
might
have
been
meanwhile
it
is
my
duty
as
a
christian
to
tell
you
in
case
you
should
desire
to
speak
to
him
ere
it
be
too
late
that
your
father
lies
at
the
point
of
death
from
a
sickness
brought
on
by
his
grief
at
the
slaying
of
his
son
and
your
cruel
desertion
of
him
and
calls
for
you
in
his
ravings
may
god
forgive
you
as
i
try
to
do
all
the
evil
that
you
have
wrought
which
perhaps
is
not
done
with
yet
unless
fate
should
bring
us
together
again
for
as
aught
i
know
it
may
i
bid
you
farewell
forever
would
that
i
had
never
seen
your
face
but
well
are
you
named
red
eve
who
like
the
false
helen
in
a
story
you
have
never
heard
were
born
to
bring
brave
men
to
their
deaths
again
farewell
de
noyon
who
is
this
helen
asked
eve
of
sir
andrew
when
the
letter
had
been
read
a
fair
grecian
daughter
over
whom
nations
fought
when
the
world
was
young
because
of
her
ah
well
she
did
not
make
herself
beautiful
did
she
and
perchance
was
more
sinned
against
than
sinning
since
women
having
but
one
life
to
live
must
follow
their
own
hearts
but
this
helen
has
been
dead
a
long
while
so
let
her
rest
if
rest
she
may
and
now
it
seems
that
acour
is
away
and
that
my
father
lies
very
sick
what
shall
i
do
return
to
him
first
i
will
make
sure
that
the
frenchman
has
gone
and
then
we
will
see
so
sir
andrew
sent
out
messengers
who
reported
it
to
be
true
that
acour
had
ridden
straight
to
london
to
see
the
king
and
then
sail
for
dover
also
they
said
that
no
frenchmen
were
left
at
blythburgh
save
those
who
would
never
leave
the
place
again
and
that
sir
john
clavering
lay
sick
in
his
bed
at
the
manor
god
fights
for
us
said
sir
andrew
with
a
little
laugh
this
acour
s
greeting
at
court
may
be
warmer
than
he
thinks
and
at
the
least
you
and
dunwich
are
well
rid
of
him
though
i
had
sooner
that
you
stayed
here
daughter
you
shall
ride
to
blythburgh
should
your
father
die
as
i
think
he
will
ere
long
it
might
grieve
you
in
the
after
years
to
remember
that
you
had
bid
him
no
farewell
if
he
recovers
or
is
harsh
with
you
it
will
be
easy
for
you
to
seek
sanctuary
chapter
vii
the
love
philtre
so
it
came
about
that
on
the
morrow
eve
and
sir
andrew
accompanied
only
by
a
single
serving
man
fearing
no
guile
since
it
seemed
certain
that
the
frenchmen
were
so
far
away
rode
across
the
moor
to
blythburgh
at
the
they
found
the
drawbridge
up
the
watchman
at
the
gate
said
also
that
his
orders
were
to
admit
none
for
the
frenchmen
being
gone
there
were
but
few
to
guard
the
place
what
good
fellow
asked
eve
not
even
the
daughter
of
the
house
who
has
heard
that
her
father
lies
so
sick
ay
he
lies
sick
lady
the
man
replied
but
such
are
his
orders
yet
if
you
will
bide
here
a
while
i
ll
go
and
learn
his
so
he
went
and
returned
presently
saying
that
sir
john
commanded
that
his
daughter
was
to
be
admitted
but
that
if
sir
andrew
attempted
to
enter
he
should
be
driven
back
by
force
will
you
go
in
or
will
you
return
with
me
asked
her
companion
of
eve
god
s
truth
she
answered
am
i
one
to
run
away
from
my
father
however
bad
his
humour
i
ll
go
in
and
set
my
case
before
him
for
after
all
he
loves
me
in
his
own
fashion
and
when
he
understands
will
i
think
your
heart
is
your
best
guide
daughter
and
it
would
be
an
ill
task
for
me
to
stand
between
sire
and
child
enter
then
for
i
am
sure
that
the
saints
and
your
own
innocence
will
protect
you
from
all
harm
at
the
worst
you
can
come
or
send
to
me
for
so
they
parted
and
the
bridge
having
been
lowered
eve
walked
boldly
to
her
father
s
sleeping
chamber
where
she
was
told
he
lay
as
she
approached
the
door
she
met
several
of
the
household
leaving
it
with
scared
faces
who
scarcely
stayed
to
salute
her
among
these
were
two
servants
of
her
dead
brother
john
men
whom
she
had
never
liked
and
a
woman
the
wife
of
one
of
them
whom
she
liked
least
of
all
pushing
open
the
door
which
was
shut
behind
her
she
advanced
toward
sir
john
who
was
not
as
she
had
thought
in
bed
but
clad
in
a
furred
robe
and
standing
by
the
hearth
on
which
burnt
a
fire
he
watched
her
come
but
said
no
word
and
the
look
of
him
frightened
her
somewhat
father
she
said
i
heard
that
you
were
sick
and
alone
ay
he
broke
in
sick
very
sick
here
and
he
laid
his
hand
upon
his
heart
where
grief
strikes
a
man
alone
too
since
you
and
your
fellow
have
done
my
only
son
to
death
murdered
my
guests
and
caused
them
to
depart
from
so
bloody
a
now
eve
who
had
come
expecting
to
find
her
father
at
the
point
of
death
and
was
prepared
to
plead
with
him
at
these
violent
words
took
fire
as
was
her
nature
you
know
well
that
you
speak
what
is
not
true
she
said
you
and
your
frenchmen
strove
to
burn
us
out
of
middle
marsh
my
brother
john
struck
hugh
de
cressi
as
though
he
were
a
dog
and
used
words
toward
him
that
no
knave
would
bear
let
alone
one
better
born
than
we
are
moreover
afterward
once
he
spared
his
life
and
grey
dick
standing
alone
against
a
crowd
did
but
use
his
skill
to
save
us
is
it
murder
then
to
protect
our
honour
and
to
save
ourselves
from
death
and
am
i
wrong
to
refuse
to
marry
a
fine
french
knave
when
i
chance
to
love
an
honest
man
and
pray
am
i
your
father
girl
that
you
dare
to
scold
at
me
thus
shouted
sir
john
growing
purple
with
wrath
if
i
choose
a
husband
for
you
by
what
right
do
you
refuse
him
saying
that
you
love
a
dunwich
down
on
your
knees
and
beg
my
pardon
or
you
shall
have
the
whipping
you
have
now
eve
s
black
eyes
glittered
dangerously
ill
would
it
go
with
any
man
who
dared
to
lay
a
hand
upon
me
she
said
drawing
herself
up
and
grasping
the
dagger
in
her
girdle
yes
very
ill
even
though
he
were
my
own
father
look
at
me
and
say
am
i
one
to
threaten
ay
and
before
you
answer
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
those
at
my
call
who
can
strike
hard
and
that
among
them
i
think
you
ll
find
the
king
of
she
paused
what
hellish
plot
is
this
that
you
hatch
against
me
asked
sir
john
with
some
note
of
doubt
in
his
voice
what
have
i
to
fear
from
my
liege
lord
the
king
of
england
only
sir
that
you
consort
with
and
would
wed
me
to
one
who
although
you
may
not
know
it
has
i
am
told
much
to
fear
from
him
so
much
that
i
wonder
that
he
has
ridden
to
seek
his
grace
s
presence
well
you
are
ill
and
i
am
angered
and
together
we
are
but
as
steel
and
flint
from
the
meeting
of
which
comes
fire
that
may
burn
us
both
therefore
since
being
better
than
i
thought
you
need
me
not
and
have
only
cruel
words
for
greeting
i
ll
bid
you
farewell
and
get
me
back
to
those
who
are
kindlier
god
be
with
you
and
give
you
your
health
ah
said
or
rather
snarled
sir
john
i
thought
as
much
and
am
ready
for
the
trick
you
d
win
back
to
sanctuary
would
you
and
the
company
of
that
old
wizard
andrew
arnold
thence
to
make
a
mock
of
me
well
not
one
step
do
you
take
upon
that
road
while
i
live
and
pushing
past
her
he
opened
the
door
and
shouted
aloud
apparently
the
men
and
woman
whom
eve
had
met
in
the
passage
were
still
waiting
there
for
instantly
they
all
reappeared
now
fellows
said
sir
john
and
you
jane
mell
take
this
rebellious
girl
of
mine
to
the
chamber
in
the
prisoners
tower
whence
i
think
she
ll
find
it
hard
to
fly
to
sanctuary
there
lock
her
fast
feeding
her
with
the
bread
and
water
of
affliction
to
tame
her
proud
spirit
and
suffering
none
to
go
near
her
save
this
woman
jane
mell
stay
give
me
that
bodkin
which
she
wears
lest
she
who
has
learned
bloody
ways
of
late
should
do
some
of
you
or
herself
a
as
he
spoke
one
of
the
men
deftly
snatched
the
dagger
from
eve
s
girdle
and
handed
it
to
sir
john
who
threw
it
into
the
farthest
corner
of
the
room
then
he
turned
and
said
now
girl
will
you
go
or
must
you
be
dragged
she
raised
her
head
slowly
and
looked
him
in
the
eyes
mad
as
he
was
with
passion
there
was
something
in
her
face
that
frightened
him
can
you
be
my
father
she
said
in
a
strained
quiet
voice
oh
glad
am
i
that
my
mother
did
not
live
to
see
this
then
she
wheeled
round
and
addressed
the
men
hearken
fellows
he
who
lays
a
finger
on
me
dies
soon
or
late
assuredly
he
dies
as
he
would
not
wish
to
die
yes
even
if
you
murder
me
for
i
have
friends
who
will
learn
the
truth
and
pay
back
coin
for
coin
with
interest
a
hundredfold
now
i
ll
go
stand
clear
knaves
and
pray
to
god
that
never
again
may
red
eve
cross
the
threshold
of
her
prison
pray
also
that
never
again
may
you
look
on
hugh
de
cressi
s
sword
or
hear
grey
dick
s
arrows
sing
or
face
the
curse
of
old
sir
so
proud
and
commanding
was
her
mien
and
so
terrible
the
import
of
her
words
that
these
rough
hinds
shrank
away
from
her
and
the
woman
hid
her
face
in
her
hands
but
sir
john
thundered
threats
and
oaths
at
them
so
that
slowly
and
unwillingly
they
ringed
eve
round
then
with
head
held
high
she
walked
thence
in
the
midst
of
them
the
prisoners
chamber
beneath
the
leads
of
the
lofty
tower
was
cold
and
unfurnished
save
for
a
stool
and
a
it
had
a
great
door
of
oak
locked
and
barred
on
the
outer
side
with
a
grille
in
it
through
which
the
poor
wretch
within
could
be
observed
there
was
no
window
only
high
up
beneath
the
ceiling
were
slits
like
loopholes
that
not
a
child
could
have
passed
such
was
the
place
to
which
eve
was
led
here
they
left
her
at
nightfall
the
door
was
opened
and
jane
mell
entered
bearing
a
loaf
of
bread
and
a
jug
of
water
which
she
set
down
upon
the
floor
would
you
aught
else
she
asked
ay
woman
answered
eve
my
thick
red
woollen
cloak
from
my
chamber
and
hood
to
match
also
water
to
wash
me
for
this
place
is
cold
and
foul
and
i
would
die
warm
and
first
i
must
get
leave
from
my
lord
your
father
said
the
woman
in
a
surly
voice
get
it
then
and
be
swift
said
eve
or
leave
it
ungotten
i
care
mell
went
and
within
half
an
hour
returned
with
the
garments
the
water
and
some
other
things
setting
them
down
without
a
word
she
departed
locking
and
bolting
the
door
behind
her
while
there
remained
a
few
rays
of
light
to
see
by
eve
ate
and
drank
heartily
for
she
needed
food
then
having
prayed
according
to
her
custom
she
laid
herself
down
and
slept
as
a
child
sleeps
for
she
was
very
strong
of
will
and
one
who
had
always
taught
herself
to
make
the
best
of
evil
fortune
when
she
woke
the
daws
were
cawing
around
the
tower
and
the
sun
shone
through
the
loopholes
she
rose
refreshed
and
ate
the
remainder
of
her
bread
then
combed
her
hair
and
dressed
herself
as
best
she
could
two
or
three
hours
later
the
door
was
opened
and
her
father
entered
glancing
at
him
she
saw
that
little
sleep
had
visited
him
that
night
for
he
looked
old
and
very
weary
so
weary
that
she
motioned
to
him
to
sit
upon
the
stool
this
he
did
breathing
heavily
and
muttering
something
about
the
steepness
of
the
tower
stairs
presently
he
spoke
eve
he
said
is
your
proud
spirit
broken
yet
no
she
answered
nor
ever
will
be
living
or
dead
you
may
kill
my
body
but
my
spirit
is
me
and
that
you
will
never
kill
as
god
gave
it
so
i
will
return
it
to
him
he
stared
at
her
with
something
of
wonder
and
more
of
admiration
in
his
look
christ
s
truth
he
said
how
proud
i
could
be
of
you
if
only
you
d
let
me
i
deem
your
courage
comes
from
your
mother
but
she
never
had
your
shape
and
beauty
and
now
you
are
the
only
one
left
and
you
hate
me
with
all
your
proud
heart
you
the
heiress
of
the
claverings
whose
estate
is
this
she
answered
pointing
to
the
bare
stone
walls
think
you
my
father
that
such
treatment
as
i
have
met
with
at
your
hands
of
late
would
breed
love
in
the
humblest
heart
what
devil
drives
you
on
to
deal
with
me
as
you
have
done
no
devil
girl
but
a
desire
for
your
own
good
and
he
added
with
a
burst
of
truth
for
the
greatness
of
my
house
after
i
am
gone
which
will
be
soon
for
your
old
wizard
spoke
rightly
when
he
said
that
i
stand
near
to
will
marrying
me
to
a
man
i
hate
be
for
my
good
and
make
your
house
great
i
tell
you
sir
it
would
kill
me
and
bring
the
claverings
to
an
end
do
you
desire
also
that
your
broad
lands
should
go
to
patch
a
spendthrift
frenchman
s
cloak
but
what
matters
your
desire
seeing
that
i
ll
not
do
it
who
love
another
man
worth
a
score
of
him
one
too
who
will
sit
higher
than
any
count
of
noyon
ever
pish
he
said
tis
but
a
girl
s
whim
you
speak
folly
being
young
and
headstrong
now
to
have
done
with
all
this
mummer
s
talk
will
you
swear
to
me
by
our
saviour
and
on
the
welfare
of
your
soul
to
break
with
hugh
de
cressi
once
and
forever
for
if
so
i
ll
let
you
free
to
leave
me
if
you
will
and
dwell
where
it
pleases
she
opened
her
lips
to
answer
but
he
held
up
his
hand
saying
wait
ere
you
speak
i
have
not
done
if
you
take
my
offer
i
ll
not
even
press
sir
edmund
acour
on
you
that
matter
shall
stand
the
chance
of
time
and
tide
only
while
you
live
you
must
have
no
more
to
do
with
the
man
who
slew
your
brother
now
will
you
swear
not
i
she
answered
how
can
i
who
but
a
few
days
ago
before
god
s
altar
and
his
priest
vowed
myself
to
this
same
hugh
de
cressi
for
all
his
life
sir
john
rose
from
the
stool
and
walked
or
rather
tottered
to
the
door
then
stay
here
till
you
rot
he
said
quite
quietly
for
i
ll
give
you
no
burial
as
for
this
hugh
i
would
have
spared
him
but
you
have
signed
his
he
was
gone
the
heavy
door
shut
the
bars
clanged
into
their
sockets
thus
these
two
parted
for
when
they
met
once
more
no
word
passed
between
them
and
although
she
knew
not
how
these
things
would
end
eve
felt
that
parting
to
be
dreadful
turning
her
face
to
the
wall
for
a
while
she
wept
then
when
the
woman
mell
came
with
her
bread
and
water
wiped
away
her
tears
and
faced
her
calmly
after
all
she
could
have
answered
no
otherwise
her
soul
was
pure
of
sin
and
for
the
rest
god
must
rule
it
at
least
she
would
die
clean
and
honest
that
night
she
was
wakened
from
her
sleep
by
the
clatter
of
horses
hoofs
on
the
courtyard
stones
she
could
hear
no
more
because
a
wind
blew
that
drowned
all
sound
of
voices
for
a
while
a
wild
hope
had
filled
her
that
hugh
had
come
or
perchance
sir
andrew
with
the
dunwich
folk
but
presently
she
remembered
that
this
was
foolish
since
these
would
never
have
been
admitted
within
the
moat
so
sighing
sadly
she
turned
to
rest
again
thinking
to
herself
that
doubtless
her
father
had
called
in
some
of
his
vassal
tenants
from
the
outlying
lands
to
guard
the
manor
in
case
it
should
be
attacked
next
morning
the
woman
jane
mell
brought
her
better
garments
to
wear
of
her
best
indeed
and
though
she
wondered
why
they
were
sent
for
the
lack
of
anything
else
to
do
she
arrayed
herself
in
them
and
braided
her
hair
with
the
help
of
a
silver
mirror
that
was
among
the
garments
a
little
later
this
woman
appeared
again
bearing
not
bread
and
water
but
good
food
and
a
cup
of
wine
the
food
she
ate
with
thankfulness
but
the
wine
she
would
not
drink
because
she
knew
that
it
was
french
and
had
heard
acour
praise
it
the
morning
wore
away
to
noon
and
again
the
door
opened
and
there
stood
before
her
sir
edmund
acour
himself
gallantly
dressed
as
she
noticed
vaguely
in
tunic
of
velvet
long
shoes
that
turned
up
at
the
toes
and
a
cap
in
which
was
set
a
single
nodding
plume
she
rose
from
her
stool
and
set
her
back
against
the
wall
with
a
prayer
to
god
in
her
heart
but
no
word
upon
her
lips
for
she
felt
that
her
best
refuge
was
silence
he
drew
the
cap
from
his
head
and
began
to
speak
lady
he
said
you
will
wonder
to
see
me
here
after
my
letter
to
you
bidding
you
farewell
but
you
will
remember
that
in
this
letter
i
wrote
that
fate
might
bring
us
together
again
and
it
has
done
so
through
no
fault
or
wish
of
mine
the
truth
is
that
when
i
was
near
to
london
i
heard
that
danger
awaited
me
there
on
account
of
certain
false
accusations
such
danger
that
i
must
return
again
to
suffolk
and
seek
a
ship
at
some
eastern
port
well
i
came
here
last
night
and
learned
that
you
were
back
out
of
sanctuary
and
also
that
you
had
quarrelled
with
your
father
who
in
his
anger
had
imprisoned
you
in
this
poor
place
an
ill
deed
as
i
think
but
in
truth
he
is
so
distraught
with
grief
and
racked
with
sickness
that
he
scarce
knows
what
he
now
he
paused
but
as
eve
made
no
answer
went
on
pity
for
your
lot
yes
and
my
love
for
you
that
eats
my
heart
out
caused
me
to
seek
your
father
s
leave
to
visit
you
and
see
if
perchance
i
could
not
soften
your
wrath
against
again
he
paused
and
again
there
was
no
answer
moreover
he
added
i
have
news
for
you
which
i
fear
you
will
think
sad
and
which
believe
me
i
pray
you
it
pains
me
to
give
though
the
man
was
my
rival
and
my
enemy
hugh
de
cressi
to
whom
you
held
yourself
affianced
is
she
quivered
a
little
at
the
words
but
still
made
no
answer
for
her
will
was
very
strong
i
had
the
story
he
continued
from
two
of
his
own
men
whom
we
met
flying
back
to
dunwich
from
london
it
seems
that
messengers
from
your
father
reached
the
court
of
the
king
before
this
hugh
telling
him
of
the
slaying
in
blythburgh
marsh
then
came
hugh
himself
whereon
the
king
seized
him
and
his
henchman
the
archer
and
at
once
put
them
on
their
trial
as
the
murderers
of
john
clavering
of
my
knights
and
thomas
of
kessland
which
they
admitted
boldly
thereon
his
grace
who
was
beside
himself
with
rage
said
that
in
a
time
of
war
when
every
man
was
needed
to
fight
the
french
he
was
determined
by
a
signal
example
to
put
a
stop
to
the
shedding
of
blood
in
these
private
feuds
so
he
ordered
the
merchant
to
the
block
and
his
henchman
the
archer
to
the
gallows
giving
them
but
one
hour
to
make
their
peace
with
god
moreover
he
went
on
searching
her
cold
impassive
face
with
his
eyes
i
did
not
escape
his
wrath
for
he
gave
command
that
i
was
to
be
seized
wherever
i
might
be
found
and
cast
into
prison
till
i
could
be
put
upon
my
trial
and
my
knights
with
me
of
your
father
s
case
he
is
considering
since
his
only
son
has
been
slain
and
he
holds
him
in
regard
therefore
it
is
that
i
am
obliged
to
avoid
london
and
take
refuge
still
eve
remained
silent
and
in
his
heart
acour
cursed
her
stubbornness
lady
he
proceeded
though
with
somewhat
less
assurance
for
now
he
must
leave
lies
and
get
to
pleading
and
never
did
a
suit
seem
more
hopeless
these
things
being
so
through
no
fault
of
mine
whose
hands
are
innocent
of
any
share
in
this
young
man
s
end
i
come
to
pray
of
you
the
sword
of
death
having
cut
all
your
oaths
that
you
will
have
pity
on
my
love
and
take
me
as
your
husband
as
is
your
father
s
wish
and
my
heart
s
desire
let
not
your
young
life
be
swallowed
up
in
grief
but
make
it
joyous
in
my
company
i
can
give
you
greatness
i
can
give
you
wealth
but
most
of
all
i
can
give
you
such
tender
adoration
as
never
woman
had
before
oh
sweet
eve
your
answer
and
he
cast
himself
upon
the
ground
before
her
and
snatching
the
hem
of
her
robe
pressed
it
to
his
lips
then
at
length
eve
spoke
in
a
voice
that
rang
like
steel
get
you
gone
knave
whose
spurs
should
be
hacked
from
your
heels
by
scullions
get
you
gone
traitor
and
liar
for
well
i
know
that
hugh
de
cressi
is
not
dead
who
had
a
certain
tale
to
tell
of
you
to
the
king
of
england
get
you
back
to
the
duke
of
normandy
and
there
ask
the
price
of
your
betrayal
of
your
liege
lord
edward
and
show
him
the
plans
of
our
eastern
coast
and
the
shores
where
his
army
may
land
in
acour
sprang
to
his
feet
and
his
face
went
white
as
ashes
thrice
he
strove
to
speak
but
could
not
then
with
a
curse
he
turned
and
left
the
chamber
the
hunt
s
up
said
father
nicholas
when
he
had
heard
all
this
tale
a
little
later
and
now
lord
i
think
that
you
had
better
away
to
france
unless
you
desire
to
stop
without
companions
in
the
church
ay
priest
i
ll
away
but
by
god
s
blood
i
ll
take
that
red
eve
with
me
for
one
thing
she
knows
too
much
to
leave
her
behind
for
a
second
i
mean
to
pay
her
back
and
for
a
third
although
you
may
think
it
strange
i
m
mad
for
her
i
tell
you
she
looked
wondrous
standing
with
her
back
against
that
wall
her
marble
face
never
wincing
when
i
told
her
all
the
lie
about
young
de
cressi
s
death
which
will
be
holy
truth
when
i
get
a
chance
at
him
watching
me
out
of
those
great
dark
eyes
of
doubtless
lord
but
how
did
she
look
when
she
called
you
knave
and
traitor
i
think
you
said
those
were
her
wicked
words
oh
he
added
with
a
ring
of
earnestness
in
his
smooth
voice
let
this
red
eve
be
at
bed
or
board
she
s
no
mate
for
you
something
fights
at
her
side
be
it
angel
or
devil
or
just
raw
chance
at
the
least
she
ll
prove
your
ruin
unless
you
let
her
then
i
ll
be
ruined
nicholas
for
i
ll
not
leave
her
for
a
while
at
any
rate
what
de
noyon
whom
they
call
danger
of
dames
beaten
by
a
country
girl
who
has
never
seen
london
or
paris
i
d
sooner
as
well
may
chance
if
the
country
lad
and
the
country
archer
come
back
with
edward
s
warrant
in
their
pouch
answered
the
priest
shrugging
his
lean
shoulders
well
lord
what
is
your
plan
to
carry
her
off
can
t
we
manage
nine
stone
of
womanhood
between
us
if
she
were
dead
it
might
be
done
though
hardly
over
these
suffolk
roads
but
being
very
much
alive
with
a
voice
to
scream
with
hands
to
fight
with
a
brain
to
think
with
and
friends
who
know
her
from
here
to
yarmouth
or
to
hull
and
monsieur
grey
dick
s
arrows
pricking
us
behind
perchance
well
i
don
t
friend
said
acour
tapping
him
on
the
shoulder
meaningly
there
must
be
some
way
there
are
always
ways
and
i
pray
you
to
hunt
them
out
come
find
me
one
or
stay
here
alone
to
explain
affairs
first
to
this
dick
whom
you
have
so
much
upon
the
brain
and
afterward
to
edward
of
england
or
his
father
nicholas
looked
at
the
great
count
s
face
then
he
looked
at
the
ground
and
having
studied
it
a
while
without
result
turned
his
beady
eyes
to
the
heavens
where
it
would
seem
that
he
found
inspiration
i
am
a
stranger
to
love
thank
the
saints
he
said
but
as
you
know
lord
i
am
a
master
leech
and
amongst
other
things
have
studied
certain
medicines
which
breed
that
passion
in
the
human
love
philtres
queried
acour
doubtfully
yes
that
kind
of
thing
one
dose
and
those
who
hate
become
enamoured
and
those
who
are
enamoured
then
in
god
s
or
satan
s
name
give
her
one
only
be
careful
it
is
the
right
sort
for
if
you
made
a
mistake
so
that
she
hated
me
any
more
than
she
does
at
present
i
know
not
what
would
happen
also
if
you
kill
her
i
ll
dig
a
sword
point
through
you
how
would
the
stuff
work
she
ll
seem
somewhat
stupid
for
a
while
perhaps
not
speak
but
only
smile
kindly
that
will
last
twelve
hours
or
so
plenty
of
time
for
you
to
be
married
and
afterward
when
the
grosser
part
of
the
potion
passes
off
leaving
only
its
divine
essence
why
afterward
she
ll
love
you
a
powerful
medicine
truly
that
can
change
the
nature
of
woman
moreover
i
d
rather
that
she
loved
me
well
as
happy
brides
do
still
i
put
up
with
the
fury
provided
it
be
of
the
good
kind
and
now
how
is
it
to
be
done
leave
that
to
me
lord
said
nicholas
with
a
cunning
smile
give
me
a
purse
of
gold
not
less
than
ten
pieces
for
some
is
needed
to
melt
in
the
mixture
and
more
to
bribe
that
woman
and
others
for
the
rest
hold
yourself
ready
to
become
a
husband
before
sunset
go
see
sir
john
and
tell
him
that
the
lady
softens
send
men
on
to
king
s
lynn
also
to
bid
them
have
our
ship
prepared
to
sail
the
minute
we
appear
which
with
good
fortune
should
be
within
hours
from
now
above
all
forget
not
that
i
run
great
risk
to
soul
and
body
for
your
sake
and
that
there
are
abbeys
vacant
in
normandy
now
farewell
i
must
to
my
work
for
this
medicine
takes
much
skill
such
as
no
other
leech
has
save
myself
ay
and
much
prayer
also
that
naught
may
hinder
its
powerful
prayer
to
the
devil
i
think
said
his
master
looking
after
him
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
god
s
truth
if
any
one
had
told
me
three
months
gone
that
de
noyon
would
live
to
seek
the
aid
of
priests
and
potions
to
win
a
woman
s
favour
i
d
have
named
him
liar
to
his
face
what
would
those
who
have
gone
before
her
think
of
this
story
i
wonder
then
with
a
bitter
laugh
he
turned
and
went
about
his
business
which
was
to
lie
to
the
father
as
he
had
lied
to
the
daughter
only
in
this
second
case
he
found
one
more
willing
to
listen
and
easier
to
deceive
on
the
following
morning
as
it
chanced
eve
had
no
relish
for
the
food
that
was
brought
to
her
for
confinement
in
that
narrow
place
had
robbed
her
of
her
appetite
also
she
had
suffered
much
from
grievous
fear
and
doubt
for
whatever
she
might
say
to
acour
how
could
she
be
sure
that
his
story
was
not
true
how
could
she
be
sure
that
her
lover
did
not
in
fact
now
lie
dead
at
the
headsman
s
hands
such
things
often
happened
when
kings
were
wroth
and
would
not
listen
or
perhaps
acour
himself
had
found
and
murdered
him
or
hired
others
to
do
the
deed
she
did
not
know
and
imprisoned
here
without
a
friend
what
means
had
she
of
coming
at
the
truth
oh
if
only
she
could
escape
if
only
she
could
speak
with
sir
andrew
for
one
brief
minute
she
poor
fool
who
had
walked
into
this
trap
of
her
own
will
she
sent
away
the
food
and
bade
the
woman
mell
bring
her
milk
for
that
would
be
easy
to
swallow
and
give
her
sustenance
after
some
hours
it
came
mell
explaining
that
she
had
been
obliged
to
send
for
it
to
the
farmsteading
as
none
drank
milk
in
the
being
thirsty
eve
took
the
pitcher
and
drained
it
to
the
last
drop
then
threw
it
down
saying
that
the
vessel
was
foul
and
made
the
milk
taste
ill
the
woman
did
not
answer
only
smiled
a
little
as
she
left
the
chamber
and
eve
wondered
why
she
smiled
a
while
later
she
grew
very
sleepy
and
as
it
seemed
to
her
had
strange
dreams
in
her
sleep
she
dreamed
of
her
childhood
when
she
and
hugh
played
together
upon
the
dunwich
shore
she
dreamed
of
her
mother
and
thought
dimly
that
she
was
warning
her
of
something
she
heard
voices
about
her
and
thought
that
they
were
calling
her
to
be
free
yes
and
followed
them
readily
enough
or
so
it
seemed
in
her
dream
followed
them
out
of
that
hateful
prison
for
the
bolts
clanged
behind
her
down
stairs
and
into
the
courtyard
where
the
sun
s
light
almost
blinded
her
and
the
fresh
air
struck
her
hot
brow
like
ice
then
there
were
more
voices
and
people
moving
to
and
fro
and
the
drone
of
a
priest
praying
and
a
touch
upon
her
hand
from
which
she
shrank
and
oh
she
wished
that
dream
were
done
for
it
was
long
long
it
wearied
her
and
grasped
her
heart
with
a
cold
clutch
of
fear
chapter
viii
too
late
it
was
past
three
o
clock
on
this
same
day
when
eve
had
drunk
the
milk
and
some
hours
after
she
began
to
dream
that
hugh
de
cressi
and
his
men
safe
and
sound
but
weary
halted
their
tired
horses
at
the
door
of
the
preceptory
of
the
templars
in
dunwich
best
go
on
to
his
worship
the
mayor
and
serve
the
king
s
writ
upon
him
master
grumbled
grey
dick
as
they
rode
up
middlegate
street
you
wasted
good
time
in
a
shooting
bout
at
windsor
against
my
will
and
now
you
ll
waste
more
time
in
a
talking
match
at
dunwich
and
the
sun
grows
low
and
the
frenchmen
may
have
heard
and
be
on
the
wing
and
who
can
see
to
lay
a
shaft
at
night
nay
man
answered
hugh
testily
first
i
must
know
how
she
the
lady
eve
will
fare
neither
better
nor
worse
for
your
knowing
about
her
but
one
with
whom
you
should
talk
may
fare
further
for
doubtless
his
spies
are
out
but
have
your
way
and
leave
me
to
thank
god
that
no
woman
ever
found
a
chance
to
clog
my
leg
perhaps
because
i
was
not
born
an
it
is
doubtful
if
hugh
heard
these
pungent
and
practical
remarks
for
ere
dick
had
finished
speaking
them
he
was
off
his
horse
and
hammering
at
the
preceptory
door
some
while
passed
before
any
answer
came
for
sir
andrew
was
walking
in
the
garden
beyond
the
church
in
no
happy
mind
because
of
certain
rumours
that
had
reached
him
and
the
old
nun
agnes
spying
armed
men
and
not
knowing
who
they
were
was
afraid
to
open
so
it
came
about
that
fifteen
minutes
or
more
went
by
before
at
length
hugh
and
his
godsire
stood
face
to
face
how
is
eve
and
where
why
is
she
not
with
you
father
he
burst
out
one
question
at
a
time
son
for
whose
safe
return
i
thank
god
i
know
not
how
she
is
and
she
is
not
with
me
because
she
is
not
here
she
has
returned
to
her
father
at
why
gasped
hugh
you
swore
to
keep
her
peace
and
you
shall
learn
and
as
shortly
as
he
could
he
told
him
is
that
all
asked
hugh
doubtfully
for
he
saw
trouble
in
sir
andrew
s
face
not
quite
son
only
i
have
learned
that
acour
and
his
folk
never
went
to
london
and
are
back
again
at
blythburgh
so
much
the
better
father
for
now
i
have
the
king
s
warrant
addressed
to
the
mayor
and
all
his
grace
s
subject
in
dunwich
to
take
these
frenchmen
living
or
ah
but
i
have
learned
also
that
her
father
holds
eve
a
prisoner
suffering
her
to
speak
with
none
and
one
lamb
among
those
wolves
oh
god
why
didst
thou
suffer
my
wisdom
to
fail
me
doubtless
for
some
good
purpose
where
is
my
faith
yet
we
must
act
hie
you
there
he
called
to
one
of
the
go
to
master
de
cressi
s
house
and
bid
him
meet
us
by
the
mounted
and
armed
with
all
his
sons
and
people
and
you
get
out
my
horse
mother
agnes
bring
my
armour
since
i
have
no
other
squire
we
ll
go
to
the
mayor
now
while
i
don
my
harness
tell
me
all
that
s
passed
wasting
no
another
almost
had
gone
by
before
hugh
met
his
father
two
of
his
brothers
and
some
men
riding
into
the
they
greeted
in
haste
but
thankfulness
and
something
of
the
tale
was
told
while
they
passed
on
to
the
house
of
the
mayor
who
as
they
thought
had
already
been
warned
of
their
coming
by
messengers
but
here
disappointment
awaited
them
for
this
officer
a
man
of
wealth
and
honour
was
as
it
chanced
absent
on
a
visit
to
norwich
whence
it
was
said
that
he
would
not
return
for
three
full
days
now
what
shall
we
do
asked
sir
andrew
his
face
falling
it
is
certain
that
the
burgesses
of
dunwich
will
not
draw
sword
in
an
unknown
quarrel
except
upon
the
direct
order
of
their
chief
for
there
is
no
time
to
collect
them
and
publish
the
king
s
warrant
it
would
seem
that
we
must
wait
till
and
prepare
not
i
answered
hugh
the
warrant
is
to
me
as
well
as
to
the
mayor
i
ll
leave
it
with
his
clerk
which
is
good
delivery
and
away
to
blythburgh
manor
on
the
instant
with
any
who
will
follow
me
or
without
them
come
dick
for
night
draws
on
and
we
ve
lost
much
now
his
father
tried
to
dissuade
him
but
he
would
not
listen
for
the
fear
in
his
heart
urged
him
forward
so
the
end
of
it
was
that
the
whole
party
of
them
thirteen
men
in
all
counting
those
that
master
de
cressi
brought
rode
away
across
the
heath
to
blythburgh
though
the
horses
of
hugh
s
party
being
very
weary
not
so
fast
as
he
could
have
wished
just
as
the
sun
sank
they
mounted
the
slope
of
the
farther
hill
on
the
crest
of
which
stood
the
backed
by
winds
the
drawbridge
is
down
thanks
be
to
god
said
sir
andrew
which
shows
that
no
attack
is
feared
i
doubt
me
son
we
shall
find
acour
that
we
shall
know
presently
answered
hugh
now
dismount
all
and
follow
they
obeyed
though
some
of
them
who
knew
old
sir
john
s
temper
seemed
not
to
like
the
business
leaving
two
of
their
people
with
the
horses
they
crossed
the
bridge
thinking
to
themselves
that
the
great
house
seemed
strangely
silent
and
deserted
now
they
were
in
the
outer
court
on
one
side
of
which
stood
the
chapel
and
still
there
was
no
one
to
be
seen
dick
tapped
hugh
upon
the
shoulder
pointing
to
a
window
of
this
chapel
that
lay
in
the
shadow
through
which
came
a
faint
glimmering
of
light
as
though
tapers
burned
upon
the
altar
i
think
there
s
a
burying
yonder
he
whispered
at
which
all
men
hugh
blanched
for
might
it
not
be
eve
whom
they
buried
but
sir
andrew
noting
it
said
nay
nay
sir
john
was
sick
come
let
us
the
door
of
the
chapel
was
open
and
they
walked
through
it
as
quietly
as
they
could
to
find
the
place
which
was
not
very
large
filled
with
people
of
these
they
took
no
heed
for
the
last
rays
of
the
sunlight
flowing
through
the
western
window
showed
them
a
scene
that
held
their
eyes
a
priest
stood
before
the
lighted
altar
holding
his
hands
in
benediction
over
a
pair
who
kneeled
at
its
rail
one
of
these
wore
a
red
cloak
down
which
her
dark
hair
streamed
she
leaned
heavily
against
the
rail
as
a
person
might
who
is
faint
with
sleep
or
with
the
ardour
of
her
orisons
it
was
red
eve
no
other
at
her
side
clad
in
gleaming
mail
kneeled
a
knight
close
by
eve
stood
her
father
looking
at
her
with
a
troubled
air
and
behind
the
knight
were
other
knights
and
in
the
little
nave
were
all
the
people
of
the
manor
and
with
them
those
that
dwelt
around
every
one
of
them
intently
watching
the
pair
before
the
altar
the
priest
perceived
them
at
first
just
as
the
last
word
of
the
blessing
passed
his
lips
why
do
armed
strangers
disturb
god
s
house
he
asked
in
a
warning
voice
the
knight
at
the
altar
rails
sprang
up
and
turned
round
hugh
saw
that
it
was
acour
but
even
then
he
noted
that
the
woman
at
his
side
she
who
wore
eve
s
garment
never
stirred
from
her
knees
sir
john
clavering
glared
down
the
chapel
and
all
the
other
people
turned
to
look
at
them
now
hugh
and
his
company
halted
in
the
open
space
where
the
nave
joined
the
chancel
and
said
answering
the
priest
i
come
hither
with
my
companions
bearing
the
warrant
of
the
king
to
seize
edmund
acour
count
de
noyon
and
convey
him
to
london
there
to
stand
his
trial
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
toward
his
liege
lord
edward
of
england
yield
you
sir
edmund
at
these
bold
words
the
french
knights
and
squires
drew
their
swords
and
ringed
themselves
round
their
captain
whereon
hugh
and
his
party
also
drew
their
swords
stay
cried
old
sir
andrew
in
his
ringing
voice
let
no
blood
be
shed
in
the
holy
house
of
god
you
men
of
suffolk
know
that
you
harbour
a
foul
traitor
in
your
bosoms
one
who
plots
to
deliver
you
to
the
french
lift
no
hand
on
his
behalf
lest
on
you
also
should
fall
the
vengeance
of
the
king
who
has
issued
his
commands
to
all
his
officers
and
people
to
seize
acour
living
or
now
a
silence
fell
upon
the
place
for
none
liked
this
talk
of
the
king
s
warrant
and
in
the
midst
of
it
hugh
asked
do
you
yield
sir
edmund
acour
or
must
we
and
the
burgesses
of
dunwich
who
gather
without
seize
you
and
your
people
acour
turned
and
began
to
talk
rapidly
with
the
priest
nicholas
while
the
congregation
stared
at
each
other
then
sir
john
clavering
who
all
this
while
had
been
listening
like
a
man
in
a
dream
suddenly
stepped
forward
hugh
de
cressi
he
said
tell
me

the
king

writ
run

clavering

hugh
i

and
tell

the
eve

resting
her
hands
upon
the
altar
rails
slowly
she
raised
herself
to
her
feet
and
turned
her
white
face
toward
him
who
spoke
she
said
was
it
hugh
that
acour
swore

and
she
laughed
a
dreadful
laugh
in
the
name
of

thundered
old
sir
andrew
tell
me
john
clavering
what
means
this
play

hugh
answered
coldly
now
yield

sir
edmund
acour
the
king

clavering
springing
forward
and
drawing
his
sword
in
my
house
my

husband
and
so

stay
till

or
pope
part
them
out
of
this
hugh
de
cressi
with
all
your
accursed
chapman
hugh
walked
toward
acour
taking
no
heed
then
suddenly
sir
john
lifted
his
sword
and
smote
with
all
his
strength
the
blow
caught
hugh
on
the
skull
and
down
he
fell
his
mail
clattering
on
the
stones
and
lay
still
with
a
whine
of
rage
grey
dick
leapt
at
clavering
drawing
from
his
side
the
archer
s
axe
he
always
wore
but
old
sir
andrew
caught
and
held
him
in
his
arms
vengeance
is
god
s
not
ours
he
said
look
as
he
spoke
sir
john
began
to
sway
to
and
fro
he
let
fall
his
murdering
sword
he
pressed
his
hands
upon
his
heart
he
threw
them
high
then
suddenly
his
knees
gave
beneath
him
he
sank
to
the
floor
a
huddled
heap
and
sat
there
resting
against
the
altar
rail
over
which
his
head
hung
backward
open
mouthed
and
eyed
the
last
light
of
the
sky
went
out
only
that
of
the
tapers
remained
eve
awake
at
last
sent
up
shriek
after
shriek
sir
andrew
bending
over
the
two
fallen
men
the
murderer
and
the
murdered
began
to
shrive
them
swiftly
ere
the
last
beat
of
life
should
have
left
their
pulses
his
father
brothers
and
grey
dick
clustered
round
hugh
and
lifted
him
the
priest
nicholas
whispered
quick
words
into
the
ears
of
acour
and
his
knights
acour
nodded
and
took
a
step
toward
eve
who
just
then
fell
swooning
and
was
grasped
by
grey
dick
with
his
left
hand
for
in
his
right
he
still
held
the
axe
no
no
hissed
nicholas
dragging
sir
edmund
back
life
is
more
than
any
then
some
one
overset
the
tapers
so
that
the
place
was
plunged
in
gloom
and
through
it
none
saw
acour
and
his
train
creep
out
by
the
chancel
door
and
hurry
to
their
horses
which
waited
saddled
in
the
inner
yard
the
frightened
congregation
fled
from
the
nave
with
white
faces
each
seeking
his
own
place
or
any
other
that
was
far
from
blythburgh
manor
for
did
not
their
dead
master
s
guilt
cling
to
them
and
would
they
not
also
be
held
guilty
of
the
murder
of
the
king
s
officer
and
swing
for
it
from
the
gallows
so
it
came
about
that
when
at
last
lights
were
brought
hugh
s
people
found
themselves
alone
the
frenchmen
have
fled
cried
grey
dick
follow
me
men
and
with
most
of
them
he
ran
out
and
began
to
search
the
manor
till
at
length
they
found
a
woman
who
told
them
that
thirty
minutes
gone
acour
and
all
his
following
had
ridden
through
the
back
gates
and
vanished
at
full
gallop
into
the
darkness
of
the
woods
with
these
tidings
dick
returned
to
the
chapel
master
de
cressi
said
sir
andrew
when
he
had
heard
it
back
with
some
of
your
people
to
dunwich
and
raise
the
burgesses
warning
them
that
the
king
s
wrath
will
be
great
if
these
traitors
escape
the
land
send
swift
messengers
to
all
the
ports
discover
where
acour
rides
and
follow
him
in
force
and
if
you
come
up
with
him
take
him
dead
or
living
stop
not
to
talk
man
begone
nay
bide
here
richard
and
those
who
rode
with
you
to
london
for
acour
may
return
again
and
some
must
be
left
to
guard
the
lady
eve
and
your
master
quick
or
de
cressi
his
two
sons
and
servants
went
and
presently
were
riding
for
dunwich
faster
than
ever
they
rode
before
but
as
it
proved
acour
was
too
swift
for
them
when
at
length
a
messenger
galloped
into
lynn
whither
they
learned
that
he
had
fled
it
was
to
find
that
his
ship
which
awaited
him
with
sails
hoisted
had
cleared
the
port
three
hours
before
with
a
wind
behind
her
which
blew
straight
for
flanders
ah
said
grey
dick
when
he
heard
the
news
this
is
what
comes
of
wasting
arrows
upon
targets
which
should
have
been
saved
for
traitors
hearts
with
those
three
hours
of
daylight
in
hand
we
d
have
ringed
the
rogues
in
or
run
them
down
well
the
devil
s
will
be
done
he
does
but
spare
his
own
till
a
better
but
when
the
king
heard
the
news
he
was
very
wroth
not
with
hugh
de
cressi
but
with
the
burgesses
of
dunwich
whose
mayor
although
he
was
blameless
lost
his
office
over
the
matter
nor
was
there
any
other
chosen
afterward
in
his
place
as
those
who
read
the
records
of
that
ancient
port
may
discover
for
themselves
when
master
de
cressi
and
his
people
were
gone
having
first
searched
the
great
and
found
none
in
it
save
a
few
and
women
whom
he
swore
to
put
to
death
if
they
disobeyed
him
grey
dick
raised
the
drawbridge
then
all
being
made
safe
he
set
a
watch
upon
the
walls
and
saw
that
there
was
wood
in
the
iron
cradle
on
the
topmost
tower
in
case
it
should
be
needful
to
light
the
beacon
and
bring
aid
but
it
was
not
since
the
sun
rose
before
any
dared
to
draw
near
those
walls
and
then
those
that
came
proved
to
be
friendly
folk
from
dunwich
bearing
the
ill
news
that
the
frenchmen
were
clean
away
about
midnight
the
door
of
the
chamber
in
which
sir
andrew
knelt
by
a
bed
whereon
lay
hugh
de
cressi
opened
and
the
tall
eve
entered
bearing
a
taper
in
her
hand
for
now
her
mind
had
returned
to
her
and
she
knew
all
is
he
dead
father
she
asked
in
a
small
strange
voice
then
still
as
any
statue
awaited
the
answer
that
was
more
to
her
than
life
nay
daughter
down
on
your
knees
and
give
thanks
god
by
the
skill
i
gained
in
eastern
lands
has
stayed
the
flow
of
his
life
s
blood
and
i
say
that
he
will
then
he
showed
her
how
her
father
s
sword
had
glanced
from
the
short
hood
of
which
he
had
given
hugh
stunning
him
but
leaving
the
skull
unbroken
biting
into
the
neck
below
it
had
severed
the
outer
vein
only
this
he
had
tied
with
a
thread
of
silk
and
burned
with
a
hot
iron
leaving
a
scar
that
hugh
bore
to
his
death
but
staunching
the
flow
of
blood
how
know
you
that
he
will
live
asked
eve
again
seeing
that
he
lies
like
one
that
is
i
know
it
daughter
question
me
no
more
as
for
his
stillness
it
is
that
which
follows
a
heavy
blow
perhaps
it
may
hold
him
fast
many
days
since
certainly
he
will
be
sick
for
long
yet
fear
nothing
he
will
now
eve
uttered
a
great
sigh
her
breast
heaved
and
colour
returned
to
her
lips
she
knelt
down
and
gave
thanks
as
the
old
had
bidden
her
then
she
rose
took
his
hand
and
kissed
it
yet
one
more
question
father
she
said
it
is
of
myself
that
knave
drugged
me
i
drank
milk
and
save
some
dreams
remember
no
more
till
i
heard
hugh
s
voice
calling
now
they
tell
me
that
i
have
stood
at
the
altar
with
de
noyon
and
that
his
priest
read
the
mass
of
marriage
over
us
and
look
oh
i
never
noted
it
till
now
there
is
a
ring
upon
my
hand
and
she
cast
it
on
the
floor
tell
me
father
according
to
the
church
s
law
is
that
man
my
my
husband
sir
andrew
s
eloquent
dark
eyes
that
ever
shadowed
forth
the
thoughts
which
passed
within
him
grew
very
troubled
i
can
not
tell
you
he
answered
awkwardly
after
thinking
a
while
this
priest
nicholas
though
i
hold
him
a
foul
villain
is
doubtless
still
a
priest
clothed
with
all
the
authority
of
our
lord
himself
since
the
unworthiness
of
the
minister
does
not
invalidate
the
sacrament
were
it
otherwise
indeed
few
would
be
well
baptized
or
wed
or
shriven
moreover
although
i
suspect
that
himself
he
mixed
the
draught
yet
he
may
not
have
known
that
you
were
drugged
and
you
stood
silent
and
it
would
appear
consenting
the
ceremony
alas
was
completed
i
myself
heard
him
give
the
benediction
your
father
assisted
thereat
and
gave
you
to
the
groom
in
the
presence
of
a
congregation
the
drugging
is
a
matter
of
surmise
and
evidence
which
may
not
be
forthcoming
since
you
are
the
only
witness
and
where
is
the
proof
i
fear
me
daughter
that
according
to
the
church
s
law
you
are
de
noyon
s
lawful
wife
the
church
s
law
she
broke
in
how
about
god
s
law
there
lies
the
only
man
to
whom
i
owe
a
bond
and
i
ll
die
a
hundred
deaths
before
any
other
shall
even
touch
my
hand
ay
if
need
be
i
ll
kill
myself
and
reason
out
the
case
with
peter
in
the
hush
hush
speak
not
so
madly
the
knot
that
the
church
ties
it
can
unloose
this
matter
must
to
his
holiness
the
pope
it
shall
be
my
business
to
lay
it
before
him
yea
letters
shall
go
to
avignon
by
the
first
safe
hand
moreover
it
well
may
happen
that
god
himself
will
free
you
by
the
sword
of
his
servant
death
this
lord
of
yours
if
indeed
he
be
your
lord
is
a
foul
traitor
the
king
of
england
seeks
his
life
and
there
is
another
who
will
seek
it
also
ere
very
long
and
he
glanced
at
the
senseless
form
of
hugh
fret
not
yourself
overmuch
daughter
be
grateful
rather
that
matters
are
no
worse
and
that
you
remain
as
you
always
were
another
hour
and
you
might
have
been
snatched
away
beyond
our
finding
what
is
not
ended
can
still
be
mended
now
go
seek
the
rest
you
need
for
i
would
not
have
two
sick
folk
on
my
hands
oh
seek
it
with
a
thankful
heart
and
forget
not
to
pray
for
the
soul
of
your
erring
father
for
after
all
he
loved
you
and
strove
for
your
welfare
according
to
his
it
may
be
so
answered
eve
and
i
ll
pray
for
him
as
is
my
duty
i
ll
pray
also
that
i
may
never
find
such
another
friend
as
my
father
showed
himself
to
then
she
bent
for
a
moment
over
hugh
stretching
out
her
hands
above
him
as
though
in
blessing
and
departed
as
silently
as
she
had
come
three
days
went
by
before
hugh
found
his
mind
again
and
after
that
for
two
weeks
he
was
so
feeble
that
he
must
lie
quite
still
and
scarcely
talk
at
all
sir
andrew
who
nursed
him
continually
with
the
help
of
grey
dick
who
brought
his
master
possets
bow
on
back
and
axe
at
side
but
never
opened
his
grim
mouth
told
his
patient
that
eve
was
safe
and
sound
but
that
he
must
not
see
her
until
he
grew
strong
again
so
hugh
strove
to
grow
strong
and
nature
helping
him
not
in
vain
at
length
there
came
a
day
when
he
might
rise
from
his
bed
and
sit
on
a
bench
in
the
pleasant
spring
sunshine
by
the
open
window
walk
he
could
not
however
not
only
on
account
of
his
weakness
but
because
of
another
hurt
now
discovered
for
the
first
time
which
in
the
end
gave
him
more
trouble
than
did
the
dreadful
and
dangerous
blow
of
clavering
s
sword
it
seemed
that
when
he
had
fallen
suddenly
beneath
that
murderous
stroke
all
his
muscles
relaxed
as
though
he
were
dead
and
his
left
ankle
bent
up
under
him
wrenching
its
sinews
in
such
a
fashion
that
for
the
rest
of
his
life
he
walked
a
little
lame
especially
was
this
so
in
the
spring
season
though
whether
because
he
had
received
his
hurt
at
that
time
or
owing
to
the
quality
of
the
air
none
could
ever
tell
him
yet
on
that
happy
day
he
thought
little
of
these
harms
who
felt
the
running
once
more
strongly
through
his
veins
and
who
awaited
eve
s
advent
at
length
she
came
stately
kind
and
beautiful
for
now
her
grief
and
terror
had
passed
by
leaving
her
as
she
was
before
her
woes
fell
upon
her
she
came
and
in
sir
andrew
s
presence
for
he
would
not
leave
them
the
tale
was
told
hugh
learned
for
the
first
time
all
the
truth
of
her
imprisonment
and
of
her
shameful
drugging
he
learned
of
the
burying
of
sir
john
clavering
and
of
her
naming
as
sole
heiress
to
his
great
estates
to
these
however
acour
had
not
been
ashamed
to
submit
some
shadowy
claim
made
in
right
of
his
lawful
wife
dame
eve
acour
countess
de
noyon
which
claim
had
been
sent
by
him
from
france
addressed
to
all
whom
it
might
he
learned
of
the
king
s
wrath
at
the
escape
of
this
same
acour
and
of
his
grace
s
seizure
of
that
false
knight
s
lands
in
suffolk
which
however
proved
to
be
so
heavily
mortgaged
that
no
one
would
grow
rich
upon
them
lastly
he
learned
that
king
edward
in
a
letter
written
by
one
of
his
secretaries
to
sir
andrew
arnold
and
received
only
that
morning
said
that
he
held
him
hugh
de
cressi
not
to
blame
for
acour
s
escape
it
commanded
also
that
if
he
recovered
from
his
wound
for
the
giving
of
which
sir
john
clavering
should
have
paid
sharply
if
he
had
lived
he
and
the
archer
his
servant
should
join
him
either
in
england
or
in
france
whither
he
purposed
shortly
to
proceed
with
all
his
host
but
the
mayor
and
men
of
dunwich
he
did
not
hold
free
of
blame
the
letter
added
moreover
that
the
king
was
advised
that
edmund
acour
on
reaching
normandy
had
openly
thrown
off
his
allegiance
to
the
crown
of
england
and
there
was
engaged
in
raising
forces
to
make
war
upon
him
further
that
this
acour
alleged
himself
to
be
the
lawfully
married
husband
of
eve
clavering
the
heiress
of
sir
john
clavering
a
point
upon
which
his
grace
demanded
information
since
if
this
were
true
he
purposed
to
escheat
the
clavering
lands
with
this
brief
and
stern
announcement
the
letter
ended
by
god
s
mercy
eve
tell
me
are
you
this
fellow
s
wife
exclaimed
hugh
not
so
she
answered
can
a
woman
who
is
dunwich
born
be
wed
without
consent
and
can
a
woman
whose
will
is
foully
drugged
out
of
her
give
consent
to
that
which
she
hates
why
if
so
there
is
no
justice
in
the
tis
a
rare
jewel
in
these
evil
days
daughter
said
sir
andrew
with
a
sigh
still
fret
not
yourself
son
hugh
a
full
statement
of
the
case
drawn
by
skilled
clerks
and
testified
to
by
many
witnesses
has
gone
forward
already
to
his
holiness
the
pope
of
which
statement
true
copies
have
been
sent
to
the
king
and
to
the
bishops
of
norwich
and
of
canterbury
yet
be
warned
that
in
such
matters
the
law
ecclesiastic
moves
but
slowly
and
then
only
when
its
wheels
are
greased
with
well
answered
hugh
with
a
fierce
laugh
there
remains
another
law
which
moves
more
swiftly
and
its
wheels
are
greased
with
vengeance
the
law
of
the
sword
if
you
are
married
eve
i
swear
that
before
very
long
you
shall
be
widowed
or
i
dead
i
ll
not
let
de
noyon
slip
a
second
time
even
if
he
stands
before
the
holiest
altar
in
i
d
have
killed
him
in
the
chapel
yonder
muttered
grey
dick
who
had
entered
with
his
master
s
food
and
not
been
sent
away
only
he
added
looking
reproachfully
at
sir
andrew
my
hand
was
stayed
by
a
certain
holy
priest
s
command
to
which
alack
i
and
did
well
to
listen
man
since
otherwise
by
now
you
would
be
i
could
mock
at
that
said
dick
sullenly
who
make
confession
in
my
own
way
and
do
not
wish
to
be
married
and
care
not
the
worth
of
a
horseshoe
nail
how
and
where
i
am
buried
provided
those
i
hate
are
buried
richard
archer
graceless
wight
that
you
are
said
sir
andrew
i
say
you
stand
in
danger
of
your
ay
father
and
so
the
frenchman
acour
stood
in
danger
of
his
body
but
you
saved
it
so
perhaps
if
there
is
need
at
the
last
you
will
do
as
much
for
my
soul
if
not
it
must
take
its
chance
and
snatching
at
the
angrily
he
turned
and
left
the
chamber
well
commented
sir
andrew
shaking
his
head
sadly
if
the
fellow
s
heart
is
hard
it
is
honest
so
may
he
be
forgiven
who
has
something
to
forgive
like
the
rest
of
us
now
hearken
to
me
son
and
daughter
wrong
grievous
and
dreadful
has
been
done
to
you
both
yet
until
death
or
the
church
levels
it
a
wall
that
you
may
not
climb
stands
between
you
and
when
you
meet
it
must
be
as
friends
no
now
i
begin
to
wish
that
i
had
learned
in
grey
dick
s
school
said
hugh
but
whatever
she
thought
eve
set
her
lips
and
said
nothing
chapter
ix
crecy
field
it
was
saturday
the
of
august
in
the
year
the
harassed
english
host
but
a
little
host
after
all
retreating
for
its
life
from
paris
had
forced
the
passage
of
the
somme
by
the
ford
which
a
forgotten
traitor
gobin
agache
by
name
revealed
to
them
now
it
stood
at
bay
upon
the
plain
of
crecy
there
to
conquer
or
to
die
will
the
french
fight
what
think
you
asked
hugh
of
grey
dick
who
had
just
descended
from
an
which
grew
in
the
garden
of
a
cottage
here
he
had
been
engaged
on
the
twofold
business
of
surveying
the
disposition
of
the
english
army
and
in
gathering
a
pocketful
of
fruit
which
remained
upon
the
tree
s
topmost
boughs
i
think
that
these
are
very
good
apples
answered
dick
speaking
with
his
mouth
full
eat
while
you
get
the
chance
master
for
who
knows
the
next
you
set
your
teeth
in
may
be
of
the
kind
that
grew
upon
the
tree
of
life
in
a
very
old
garden
and
he
handed
him
two
of
the
best
then
he
turned
to
certain
archers
who
clustered
round
with
outstretched
hands
saying
why
should
i
give
you
my
apples
fellows
seeing
that
you
were
too
lazy
to
climb
and
get
them
for
yourselves
none
of
you
ever
gave
me
anything
when
i
was
hungry
after
the
sack
of
caen
in
which
my
master
being
squeamish
would
take
no
part
therefore
i
went
to
bed
supperless
because
as
i
remember
you
said
i
had
not
earned
it
still
as
i
don
t
want
to
fight
the
french
with
a
bellyache
go
scramble
for
then
with
a
quick
motion
he
flung
the
apples
to
a
distance
all
save
one
which
he
presented
to
a
tall
man
who
stood
near
adding
take
this
jack
green
in
token
of
fellowship
since
i
have
nothing
else
to
offer
you
i
beat
you
at
windsor
didn
t
i
when
we
shot
a
match
before
the
king
now
show
your
skill
and
beat
me
and
i
ll
say
thank
keep
count
of
your
arrows
shot
jack
and
i
ll
keep
count
of
mine
and
when
the
battle
is
over
he
who
has
grassed
most
frenchmen
shall
be
called
the
better
then
i
m
that
already
lad
answered
the
great
yeoman
with
a
grin
as
he
set
his
teeth
in
the
apple
for
look
you
having
served
at
court
i
ve
learned
how
to
lie
and
shall
swear
i
never
wasted
shaft
whereas
you
being
country
born
may
own
to
a
miss
or
two
for
shame
s
sake
or
likelier
still
those
french
will
have
one
or
both
of
us
in
their
bag
if
all
tales
are
true
there
is
such
a
countless
host
of
them
that
we
few
english
shall
not
see
the
sky
for
dick
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
was
about
to
answer
when
suddenly
a
sound
of
shouting
deep
and
glad
rose
from
the
serried
companies
upon
their
left
then
the
voice
of
an
officer
was
heard
calling
line
line
the
king
comes
another
minute
and
over
the
crest
of
a
little
rise
appeared
edward
of
england
clad
in
full
armour
he
wore
a
surtout
embroidered
with
the
arms
of
england
and
france
but
his
helm
hung
at
his
that
all
might
see
his
face
he
was
mounted
not
on
his
war
steed
but
on
a
small
white
ambling
palfrey
and
in
his
hand
he
bore
a
short
baton
with
him
came
two
marshalls
gaily
dressed
and
a
slim
young
man
clad
from
head
to
foot
in
plain
black
armour
and
wearing
a
great
ruby
in
his
helm
whom
all
knew
for
edward
prince
of
wales
on
he
rode
acknowledging
the
cheering
of
his
soldiers
with
smiles
and
courtly
bows
till
at
length
he
pulled
rein
just
in
front
of
the
triple
line
of
archers
among
whom
were
mingled
some
knights
and
for
the
order
of
battle
was
not
yet
fully
set
just
then
on
the
plain
beneath
riding
from
out
the
shelter
of
some
trees
and
as
they
thought
beyond
the
reach
of
arrows
appeared
four
splendid
french
knights
and
with
them
a
few
squires
there
they
halted
taking
stock
it
would
seem
of
the
disposition
of
the
english
army
who
are
those
that
wear
such
fine
feathers
asked
the
king
one
is
the
lord
of
bazeilles
answered
a
marshall
i
can
see
the
monk
upon
his
crest
but
the
blazons
of
the
others
i
can
not
read
they
spy
upon
us
sire
may
we
sally
out
and
take
them
nay
answered
edward
their
horses
are
fresher
than
ours
let
them
go
for
pray
god
we
shall
see
them
closer
so
the
french
knights
having
stared
their
full
turned
and
rode
away
slowly
but
one
of
their
squires
did
otherwise
dismounting
from
his
horse
which
he
left
with
another
squire
to
hold
he
ran
forward
a
few
paces
to
the
crest
of
a
little
knoll
thence
he
made
gestures
of
contempt
and
scorn
toward
the
english
army
as
he
did
so
shouting
foul
words
of
which
a
few
floated
to
them
in
the
stillness
now
said
edward
if
i
had
an
archer
who
could
reach
that
varlet
i
ll
swear
that
his
name
should
not
be
forgotten
in
england
but
alas
it
may
not
be
for
none
cam
make
an
arrow
fly
true
so
instantly
grey
dick
stepped
forward
sire
may
i
try
he
asked
stringing
his
great
black
bow
as
he
spoke
who
are
you
said
the
king
who
seem
to
have
been
rolled
in
ashes
and
wear
my
own
gold
arrow
in
your
cap
ah
i
remember
the
suffolk
man
who
showed
us
all
how
to
shoot
at
windsor
he
who
is
called
grey
dick
yes
try
grey
dick
try
if
you
think
that
you
can
reach
so
far
yet
for
the
honour
of
george
man
do
not
miss
for
all
the
host
will
see
fate
riding
on
your
for
one
moment
dick
hesitated
such
awful
words
seemed
to
shake
even
his
iron
nerve
i
ve
seen
you
do
as
much
dick
said
the
quiet
voice
of
hugh
de
cressi
behind
him
still
judge
then
dick
ground
his
heels
into
the
turf
and
laid
his
weight
against
the
bow
while
all
men
watched
breathless
he
drew
it
to
an
arc
he
drew
it
till
the
string
was
level
with
his
ear
he
loosed
then
slewing
round
straightened
himself
and
stared
down
at
the
earth
as
he
said
afterward
he
feared
to
watch
that
arrow
away
it
sped
while
all
men
gazed
high
high
it
flew
the
sunlight
glinting
on
its
polished
barb
down
it
came
at
length
and
the
king
muttered
short
but
while
the
word
passed
his
lips
that
shaft
seemed
to
recover
itself
as
though
by
magic
and
again
rushed
on
he
of
the
foul
words
and
gestures
saw
it
coming
and
turned
to
fly
as
he
leapt
forward
the
war
arrow
struck
him
full
in
the
small
of
the
back
just
where
the
spine
ends
severing
it
so
that
he
fell
all
of
a
heap
like
an
ox
beneath
the
axe
and
lay
a
still
and
huddled
shape
from
all
the
english
right
who
saw
this
wondrous
deed
there
went
up
such
a
shout
that
their
comrades
to
the
left
and
rear
thought
for
a
moment
that
battle
had
been
joined
the
king
and
the
prince
stared
amazed
hugh
flung
his
arms
about
dick
s
neck
and
kissed
him
jack
green
cried
no
archer
but
a
wizard
mere
man
could
not
have
sent
a
true
shaft
so
then
would
to
heaven
i
had
more
such
wizards
said
the
king
god
be
with
you
grey
dick
for
you
have
put
new
heart
into
my
and
all
our
company
mark
each
of
you
that
he
smote
him
in
the
back
smote
him
running
what
reward
would
you
have
man
none
answered
dick
in
a
surly
voice
my
reward
is
that
whatever
happens
yon
filthy
french
knave
will
never
mock
honest
english
folk
again
or
so
i
think
though
the
arrow
barely
reached
him
yet
sire
he
added
after
a
pause
you
might
knight
my
master
hugh
de
cressi
if
you
will
since
but
for
him
i
should
have
feared
to
risk
that
then
turning
aside
dick
unstrung
his
bow
and
pulling
the
remains
of
the
apple
out
of
his
pouch
began
to
munch
it
unconcernedly
hugh
de
cressi
said
the
king
ah
yes
i
mind
me
of
him
and
of
the
rogue
acour
and
the
maid
red
eve
well
hugh
i
am
told
you
fought
gallantly
at
two
days
gone
and
were
among
the
last
to
cross
the
somme
also
we
have
other
debts
to
pay
you
come
hither
sir
and
give
me
your
your
pardon
my
liege
said
hugh
colouring
but
i
ll
not
be
knighted
for
my
henchman
s
feats
or
at
all
until
i
have
done
some
of
my
ah
well
master
hugh
said
the
king
that
s
a
right
spirit
after
the
battle
perhaps
if
it
should
please
god
that
we
live
to
meet
again
in
honour
de
cressi
he
added
musingly
why
this
place
is
called
crecy
and
here
i
think
is
another
good
omen
at
crecy
shall
de
cressi
gain
great
honour
for
himself
and
for
george
of
england
you
are
luck
bringers
you
two
let
them
not
be
separated
in
the
battle
lest
the
luck
should
leave
them
see
to
it
if
it
please
you
my
lord
of
warwick
young
de
cressi
can
draw
a
bow
let
him
fight
amongst
the
archers
and
have
liberty
to
join
the
when
the
time
comes
or
stay
set
them
near
my
son
the
prince
for
there
surely
the
fight
will
be
hottest
and
now
you
men
of
england
whatever
your
degree
my
brothers
of
england
gentle
and
simple
philip
rolls
down
upon
us
with
all
the
might
of
france
our
heritage
which
he
has
stolen
our
heritage
and
yours
well
well
show
him
or
or
whenever
it
may
be
that
englishmen
put
not
their
faith
in
numbers
but
in
justice
and
their
own
great
hearts
oh
my
brothers
and
my
friends
let
not
edward
whom
you
are
pleased
to
serve
as
your
lawful
king
be
whipped
off
the
field
of
crecy
and
out
of
france
stand
to
your
banners
stand
to
your
king
stand
to
george
and
god
die
where
you
are
if
need
be
as
i
will
never
threaten
and
then
show
your
backs
like
that
knave
the
archer
shot
but
now
look
i
give
my
son
into
your
keeping
and
he
pointed
to
the
young
prince
who
all
this
while
sat
upon
his
horse
upright
and
silent
the
hope
of
england
shall
be
your
leader
but
if
he
flies
why
then
cut
him
down
and
fight
without
him
but
he
ll
not
fly
and
you
ll
not
fly
no
you
and
he
together
will
this
day
earn
a
name
that
shall
be
told
of
when
the
world
is
grey
with
age
great
is
the
chance
that
life
has
given
you
pluck
it
pluck
it
from
the
land
of
opportunity
and
dead

the

in

with
a
glad
smile
edward
took
his
young

and
shook
it
then
rode
away

son
edward
fare
you
well
also
meet
me
again
with
honour
or
never
it
was
not
yet
noon
when
king
edward
spoke
these
words
and
long
hours
were
to
go
by
before
the
battle
joined
indeed
most
thought
that
no
blow
would
be
struck
that
day
since
it
was
known
that
philip
had
slept
at
abbeville
whence
for
a
great
army
the
march
was
somewhat
long
still
when
all
was
made
ready
the
english
sat
them
down
in
their
ranks
bows
and
helmets
at
side
ate
their
meal
with
appetite
and
waited
whatever
fate
might
send
them
in
obedience
to
the
king
s
command
hugh
and
grey
dick
had
been
attached
to
the
immediate
person
of
the
prince
of
wales
who
had
about
him
besides
his
own
knights
a
small
band
of
chosen
archers
and
another
band
of
picked
for
their
strength
and
courage
these
soldiers
were
all
dismounted
since
the
order
had
gone
forth
that
knight
and
squire
must
fight
afoot
every
horse
having
been
sent
to
the
rear
for
that
day
the
english
expected
to
receive
charges
not
to
make
them
this
indeed
would
have
been
impossible
seeing
that
all
along
their
front
the
wild
welsh
had
laboured
for
hours
digging
pits
into
which
horses
might
plunge
and
fall
there
then
the
prince
s
battle
sat
a
small
force
after
all
perhaps
twelve
hundred
knights
and
with
three
or
four
thousand
archers
and
to
their
rear
as
many
of
the
savage
welsh
who
fought
that
day
under
the
banner
of
their
country
the
red
dragon
of
merlin
grey
dick
s
place
was
on
the
extreme
left
of
the
archer
bodyguard
and
hugh
s
on
the
extreme
right
of
that
of
the
so
that
they
were
but
a
few
yards
apart
and
could
talk
together
from
time
to
time
they
spoke
of
sundry
things
but
mostly
of
home
for
in
this
hour
of
danger
through
which
both
of
them
could
hardly
hope
to
live
even
if
one
did
their
thoughts
turned
thither
as
was
but
natural
i
wonder
how
it
fares
with
the
lady
eve
said
hugh
with
a
sigh
for
of
her
no
news
had
come
to
him
since
they
had
parted
some
months
before
after
he
recovered
from
the
wound
which
clavering
gave
him
well
enough
doubtless
why
not
replied
dick
she
is
strong
and
healthy
she
has
many
friends
and
servants
to
guard
her
and
no
enemy
there
to
harm
her
for
her
great
foe
is
yonder
and
he
nodded
towards
abbeville
oh
without
doubt
well
enough
it
is
she
who
should
wonder
how
it
fares
with
us
let
us
hope
that
having
naught
else
to
do
she
remembers
us
in
her
prayers
since
in
such
a
case
even
one
woman
s
prayers
are
worth
something
for
does
not
a
single
feather
sometimes
turn
the
scale
i
think
that
eve
would
rather
fight
than
pray
answered
hugh
with
a
smile
like
old
sir
andrew
who
would
give
half
his
remaining
days
to
sit
here
with
us
this
afternoon
well
he
is
better
where
he
is
dick
that
knave
acour
sent
only
insolent
words
in
answer
to
my
challenge
which
i
despatched
to
him
by
the
knight
i
took
and
spared
at
why
should
he
do
more
master
he
can
find
plenty
of
ways
of
dying
without
risking
a
single
combat
with
one
whom
he
has
wronged
and
who
is
therefore
very
dangerous
you
remember
his
crest
master
a
silver
swan
painted
on
his
shield
i
knew
it
and
that
is
why
i
shot
that
poor
fowl
just
before
you
killed
young
clavering
on
the
banks
of
blythe
to
teach
him
that
swans
are
not
proof
against
arrows
watch
for
the
swan
crest
master
when
the
battle
joins
and
so
will
i
i
promise
ay
i
ll
watch
said
hugh
grimly
god
help
all
swans
that
come
my
way
let
us
pray
that
this
one
has
not
taken
wing
for
if
so
i
too
must
learn
to
thus
they
talked
of
these
and
other
things
amongst
the
hum
of
the
great
camp
which
was
like
to
that
of
bees
on
a
in
summer
and
whilst
they
talked
the
blue
august
sky
became
suddenly
overcast
dense
and
heavy
clouds
hid
up
its
face
a
cold
and
fitful
wind
began
to
blow
increasing
presently
to
a
gale
which
caused
the
planted
standards
blazoned
with
lions
rampant
and
with
and
the
pennons
of
a
hundred
knights
set
here
and
there
among
the
long
battle
lines
first
to
flap
and
waver
and
then
to
stand
out
straight
as
though
they
were
cut
of
iron
a
word
of
command
was
called
from
rank
to
rank
sheath
bows
it
said
and
instantly
thousands
of
slender
points
were
lifted
and
sank
again
vanishing
into
the
leathern
cases
which
the
archers
bore
scarcely
were
these
snug
when
the
storm
broke
first
fell
a
few
heavy
drops
to
be
followed
by
such
a
torrent
that
all
who
had
cloaks
were
glad
to
wear
them
from
the
black
clouds
above
leapt
lightnings
that
were
succeeded
by
the
deep
and
solemn
roll
of
thunder
a
darkness
fell
upon
the
field
so
great
that
men
wondered
what
it
might
portend
for
their
minds
were
strained
that
which
at
other
times
would
have
passed
without
remark
now
became
portentous
indeed
afterward
some
declared
that
through
it
they
had
seen
angels
or
demons
in
the
air
and
others
that
they
had
heard
a
voice
prophesying
woe
and
death
to
whom
they
knew
not
it
is
nothing
but
a
harvest
tempest
said
dick
presently
as
he
shook
the
wet
from
him
like
a
dog
and
looked
to
the
covering
of
his
quiver
see
the
clouds
as
he
spoke
a
single
red
ray
from
the
westering
sun
shot
through
a
rift
in
the
sky
and
lay
across
the
english
host
like
a
sword
of
light
whereof
the
point
hung
over
the
eastern
plain
save
for
this
flaming
sword
all
else
was
dark
and
silent
also
for
the
rain
and
thunder
had
died
away
only
thousands
of
crows
frightened
from
the
woods
wheeled
to
and
fro
above
their
black
wings
turning
to
the
redness
of
blood
as
they
crossed
and
recrossed
that
splendid
path
of
light
and
their
hoarse
cries
filling
the
solemn
air
with
clamour
the
sight
and
sounds
were
strange
nor
did
the
fellow
crouched
upon
crecy
s
fateful
plain
ever
forget
them
till
his
dying
day
the
sky
cleared
by
slow
degrees
the
multitudes
of
crows
wheeled
off
toward
the
east
and
vanished
the
sun
shone
out
again
in
quiet
glory
pray
god
the
french
fight
us
said
hugh
as
he
took
off
his
cloak
and
rolled
it
up
why
master
because
dick
it
is
written
that
the
rain
falls
on
the
just
and
the
unjust
and
the
unjust
that
is
the
french
or
rather
the
italians
whom
they
hire
use
these
which
as
you
know
can
not
be
cased
like
ours
and
therefore
stretch
their
strings
in
master
remarked
dick
i
did
not
think
you
had
so
much
wit
that
is
since
you
fell
in
love
for
before
then
you
were
sharp
enough
well
you
are
right
and
a
little
matter
like
that
may
turn
a
battle
not
but
what
i
had
thought
of
it
hugh
was
about
to
answer
with
spirit
when
a
sound
of
distant
shouting
broke
upon
their
ears
a
very
mighty
sound
and
next
instant
some
outposts
were
seen
galloping
in
calling
arm
arm
the
french
the
french
suddenly
there
appeared
thousands
of
men
in
thick
wavering
lines
and
behind
them
the
points
of
thousands
of
spears
whose
bearers
as
yet
were
hidden
by
the
living
screen
of
the
italian
archers
yes
before
them
was
the
mighty
host
of
france
glittering
in
the
splendid
light
of
the
westering
sun
which
shone
full
into
their
faces
the
irregular
lines
halted
perhaps
there
was
something
in
the
aspect
of
those
bands
of
englishmen
still
seated
in
silence
on
the
ground
with
never
a
horse
among
them
that
gave
them
pause
then
as
though
at
a
word
of
command
the
genoese
men
set
up
a
terrific
shout
do
they
think
to
make
us
run
at
a
noise
like
hares
said
hugh
contemptuously
but
grey
dick
made
no
answer
for
already
his
pale
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
foe
with
a
stare
that
hugh
thought
was
terrible
and
his
long
fingers
were
playing
with
the
button
of
his
the
genoese
advanced
a
little
way
then
again
stood
and
shouted
but
still
the
english
sat
silent
a
third
time
they
advanced
and
shouted
more
loudly
than
before
then
began
to
wind
up
their
from
somewhere
in
the
english
centre
rose
a
heavy
thudding
sound
which
was
new
to
war
it
came
from
the
mouths
of
cannons
now
for
the
first
time
fired
on
a
field
of
battle
and
at
the
report
of
them
the
genoese
frightened
fell
back
a
little
seeing
that
the
balls
fell
short
and
did
but
hop
toward
them
slowly
they
took
courage
again
and
began
to
loose
their
bolts
you
re
right
master
exclaimed
grey
dick
in
a
fierce
chuckle
their
strings
wet
and
he
pointed
to
the
quarrels
that
like
the
cannon
balls
struck
short
some
within
fifty
paces
of
those
who
shot
them
so
that
no
man
was
hurt
now
came
a
swift
command
and
the
english
ranks
rose
to
their
feet
uncased
their
bows
and
strung
them
all
as
though
with
a
single
hand
a
second
command
and
every
bow
was
bent
a
third
and
with
a
noise
that
was
half
hiss
and
half
moan
thousands
of
arrows
leapt
forward
forward
they
leapt
and
swift
and
terrible
they
fell
among
the
ranks
of
the
advancing
genoese
yes
and
ere
ever
one
had
found
its
billet
its
was
hastening
on
its
path
then
oh
the
sunlight
showed
it
all
the
genoese
rolled
over
by
scores
their
frail
armour
bitten
through
and
through
by
the
grey
english
arrows
by
scores
that
grew
to
hundreds
that
grew
till
the
poor
helpless
men
who
were
yet
unhurt
among
them
wailed
out
in
their
fear
and
after
one
short
hesitant
moment
surged
back
upon
the
long
lines
of
behind
from
these
arose
a
great
shout
trahison
tuez
tuez
next
instant
the
appalling
sight
was
seen
of
the
chivalry
of
france
falling
upon
their
friends
whose
only
crime
was
that
their
were
wet
and
butchering
them
where
they
stood
so
awful
and
unexpected
was
this
spectacle
that
for
a
little
while
the
english
archers
all
except
grey
dick
and
a
few
others
cast
in
the
same
iron
mould
ceased
to
ply
their
bows
and
watched
amazed
the
long
shafts
began
to
fly
again
raining
alike
upon
the
slaughterers
and
the
slaughtered
a
few
minutes
five
perhaps
and
this
terrible
scene
was
over
for
of
the
seven
thousand
genoese
but
a
tithe
remained
upon
their
feet
and
the
interminable
french
lines
clad
in
sparkling
steel
and
waving
lance
and
sword
charged
down
upon
the
little
english
band
now
for
the
feast
screamed
grey
dick
that
was
but
a
snack
to
sharp
the
appetite
and
as
he
said
the
words
a
gorgeous
knight
died
with
his
arrow
through
the
heart
it
came
the
charge
came
nothing
could
stop
it
down
went
man
and
horse
line
upon
line
of
them
swept
to
death
by
the
pitiless
english
arrows
but
still
more
rushed
on
they
fell
in
the
pits
that
had
been
dug
they
died
beneath
the
shafts
and
the
hoofs
of
those
that
followed
but
still
they
struggled
on
shouting
philip
and
denis
and
waving
their
golden
banner
the
oriflamme
of
france
the
charge
crept
up
as
a
reluctant
outworn
wave
creeps
to
a
resisting
rock
it
foamed
upon
the
rock
the
archers
ceased
to
shoot
and
drew
their
axes
the
leapt
forward
the
battle
had
joined
at
last
breast
to
breast
they
wrestled
now
hugh
s
sword
was
red
and
red
was
grey
dick
s
axe
fight
as
they
would
the
english
were
borne
back
the
young
prince
waved
his
arm
screaming
something
and
at
that
sight
the
english
line
checked
its
retreat
stood
still
and
next
plunged
forward
with
a
roar
of
england
and
the
prince
that
assault
was
over
backward
rolled
the
ride
of
men
those
who
were
left
living
after
them
went
the
dark
welsh
their
commanders
ordered
them
to
stand
the
earl
of
warwick
ordered
them
to
stand
the
prince
himself
ordered
them
to
stand
running
in
front
of
them
only
to
be
swept
aside
like
a
straw
before
a
draught
of
wind
out
they
broke
grinning
and
gnashing
their
teeth
great
knives
in
their
hands
the
red
dragon
of
merlin
which
a
giant
bore
led
them
on
it
sank
it
fell
it
rose
again
the
giant
was
down
but
another
had
it
they
scrambled
over
the
mass
of
dead
and
dying
they
got
among
the
living
beyond
with
eerie
screams
they
houghed
the
horses
and
when
the
riders
fell
hacked
open
the
lacings
of
their
helms
and
unheeding
of
any
cries
for
mercy
drove
the
great
knives
home
at
length
all
were
dead
and
they
returned
again
waving
those
red
knives
and
singing
some
fierce
chant
in
their
unknown
tongue
the
battle
was
not
over
yet
fresh
horses
of
frenchmen
gathered
out
of
arrow
range
and
charged
again
under
the
banners
of
blois
alencon
lorraine
and
flanders
forward
they
swept
and
with
them
came
one
who
looked
like
a
king
for
he
wore
a
crown
upon
his
helm
the
dick
noted
him
and
that
his
bridle
was
bound
to
those
of
the
knights
who
rode
upon
his
either
side
on
them
he
rained
shafts
from
his
great
black
bow
for
grey
dick
never
shot
without
an
aim
and
after
the
battle
one
of
his
marked
arrows
was
found
fixed
in
the
throat
of
the
blind
king
of
bohemia
this
second
charge
could
not
be
stayed
step
by
step
the
english
knights
were
beaten
back
the
line
of
archers
was
broken
through
his
guard
formed
round
the
prince
hugh
among
them
heavy
horses
swept
on
to
them
beneath
the
hoofs
of
one
of
these
hugh
was
felled
but
stabbing
it
from
below
caused
the
poor
beast
to
leap
aside
he
gained
his
feet
again
the
prince
was
down
a
splendid
knight
it
was
the
count
of
flanders
who
had
sprung
from
his
horse
stood
over
him
his
sword
point
at
his
throat
and
called
on
him
to
yield
up
ran
robert
fitzsimmon
the
standard
bearer
shouting
to
the
son
of
the
king
to
the
son
of
the
king
he
struck
down
a
knight
with
the
pole
of
his
standard
hugh
sprang
like
a
at
louis
of
flanders
and
drove
his
sword
through
his
throat
richard
de
beaumont
flung
the
great
banner
of
wales
over
the
prince
hiding
him
till
more
help
came
to
beat
back
the
foe
then
the
prince
struggled
from
the
ground
gasping
i
thank
you
friends
and
once
more
the
french
retreated
the
welsh
banner
rose
again
and
that
danger
was
over
the
earl
of
warwick
ran
up
hugh
noted
that
his
armour
was
covered
with
blood
john
of
norwich
he
cried
to
an
aged
knight
who
stood
leaning
on
his
sword
take
one
with
you
away
to
the
king
and
pray
him
for
aid
the
french
gather
again
we
are
outworn
with

young

danger
of
his
life
or
liberty
begone
old
john
s
eyes
fell
on
hugh
come
with
me
you
suffolk
man
he
said
and
away
they
went
now
what
would
you
give
he
gasped
as
they
ran
to
be
drinking
a
stoup
of
ale
with
me
in
my
tower
of
mettingham
as
you
have
done
before
this
red
day
dawned
what
would
you
give
young
hugh
de
cressi
nothing
at
all
answered
hugh
rather
would
i
die
upon
this
field
in
glory
than
drink
all
the
ale
in
suffolk
for
a
hundred
well
said
young
man
grunted
john
so
do
i
think
would
i
though
i
have
never
longed
for
a
quart
of
liquor
they
came
to
a
windmill
and
climbed
its
steep
stairs
on
the
top
stage
amid
the
corn
sacks
stood
edward
of
england
looking
through
the
your
business
sir
john
he
said
scarcely
turning
his
head
the
old
knight
told
it
shortly
my
son
is
not
dead
and
is
not
wounded
replied
the
king
and
i
have
none
to
send
to
his
aid
bid
him
win
his
spurs
the
day
shall
yet
be
his
look
he
added
pointing
through
the
our
banners
have
not
given
back
a
spear
s
throw
and
in
front
of
them
the
field
is
paved
with
dead
i
tell
you
the
french
break
back
de
norwich
back
de
cressi
and
bid
the
prince
to
charge
some
one
thrust
a
cup
of
wine
into
hugh
s
hand
he
swallowed
it
glancing
at
the
wild
scene
below
and
presently
was
running
with
sir
john
toward
the
spot
where
they
saw
the
prince
s
banner
flying
they
came
to
warwick
and
told
him
the
king
s
answer
my
father
speaks
well
said
the
prince
let
none
share
our
glory
this
day
my
lord
form
up
the
lines
and
when
my
banner
is
lifted
thrice
give
the
word
to
charge
linger
not
the
dark
is
near
and
either
france
or
england
must
go
down
ere
forward
rolled
the
french
in
their
last
desperate
onset
horse
and
foot
mingled
together
forward
they
rolled
almost
in
silence
the
arrows
playing
on
their
dense
host
but
not
as
they
did
at
first
for
many
a
quiver
was
empty
once
twice
thrice
the
prince
s
banner
bowed
and
lifted
and
as
it
rose
for
the
third
time
there
rang
out
a
shout
of
charge
for
george
and
edward
then
england
that
all
these
long
hours
had
stood
still
suddenly
hurled
herself
upon
the
foe
hugh
leaping
over
a
heap
of
dead
and
dying
saw
in
front
of
him
a
knight
who
wore
a
helmet
shaped
like
a
wolf
s
head
and
had
a
wolf
painted
upon
his
shield
the
wolf
knight
charged
at
him
as
though
he
sought
him
alone
an
arrow
from
behind
it
was
grey
dick
s
sank
up
to
the
feathers
in
the
horse
s
neck
and
down
it
came
the
rider
shook
himself
clear
and
began
to
fight
hugh
was
beaten
to
his
knee
beneath
a
heavy
blow
that
his
helm
turned
he
rose
unhurt
and
rushed
at
the
knight
who
in
avoiding
his
onset
caught
his
spur
on
the
body
of
a
dead
man
and
fell
backward
hugh
leapt
on
to
him
striving
to
thrust
his
sword
up
beneath
his
gorget
and
make
an
end
of
him
grace
said
the
knight
in
french
i
yield
we
take
no
prisoners
answered
hugh
as
he
thrust
again
pity
then
said
the
knight
you
are
brave
would
you
butcher
a
fallen
man
if
you
had
tripped
i
would
have
spared
you
show
mercy
some
day
your
case
may
be
mine
and
it
will
be
repaid
to
hugh
hesitated
although
now
the
point
of
his
sword
was
through
the
lacing
of
the
gorget
for
your
lady
s
sake
pity
gasped
the
knight
as
he
felt
its
point
you
know
by
what
name
to
conjure
said
hugh
doubtfully
well
get
you
gone
if
you
can
and
pray
for
one
hugh
de
cressi
for
he
gives
you
your
the
knight
seemed
to
start
then
struggled
to
his
feet
and
seizing
a
loose
horse
by
the
bridle
swung
himself
to
the
saddle
and
galloped
off
into
the
shadows
master
croaked
a
voice
into
hugh
s
ear
i
ve
seen
the
swan
follow
me
my
arrows
are
all
gone
or
i
d
have
shot
god
s
truth
show
him
to
me
gasped
hugh
and
away
they
leapt
together
soon
they
had
outrun
even
the
slaughtering
welsh
and
found
themselves
mingled
with
fugitives
from
the
french
army
but
in
the
gathering
twilight
none
seemed
to
take
any
note
of
them
indeed
every
man
was
engaged
in
saving
his
own
life
and
thought
that
this
was
the
purpose
of
these
two
also
some
three
hundred
yards
away
certain
french
knights
mounted
often
two
upon
one
horse
or
afoot
were
flying
from
that
awful
field
striking
out
to
the
right
in
order
to
clear
themselves
of
the
cumbering
horde
of
fugitives
one
of
these
knights
lagged
behind
evidently
because
his
horse
was
wounded
he
turned
to
look
back
and
a
last
ray
from
the
dying
sun
lit
upon
him
look
said
dick
and
hugh
saw
that
on
the
knight
s
shield
was
blazoned
a
white
swan
and
that
he
wore
upon
his
helmet
a
swan
for
a
crest
the
knight
who
had
not
seen
them
spurred
his
horse
but
it
would
not
or
could
not
move
then
he
called
to
his
companions
for
help
but
they
took
no
heed
finding
himself
alone
he
dismounted
hastily
examined
the
horse
s
wound
and
having
unbuckled
a
cloak
from
his
saddle
cast
down
his
shield
in
order
that
he
might
run
more
lightly
thanks
to
god
he
is
mine
muttered
hugh
touch
him
not
dick
unless
i
fall
and
then
do
you
take
up
the
quarrel
till
you
so
speaking
he
leapt
upon
the
man
out
of
the
shadow
of
some
thorns
that
grew
there
lift
your
shield
and
fight
said
hugh
advancing
on
him
with
raised
sword
i
am
hugh
de
then
sir
i
yield
myself
your
prisoner
answered
the
knight
seeing
that
you
are
two
and
i
but
not
so
i
take
no
prisoners
who
seek
vengeance
not
ransom
and
least
of
all
from
you
my
companion
shall
not
touch
you
unless
i
fall
swift
now
the
light
dies
and
i
would
kill
you
the
knight
picked
up
his
shield
i
know
you
he
said
i
am
not
he
you
and
i
know
you
answered
hugh
now
no
words
of
them
there
have
been
enough
between
us
and
he
smote
at
him
for
two
minutes
or
more
they
fought
for
the
armour
of
both
was
good
and
one
was
full
of
rage
and
the
other
of
despair
there
was
little
fine
about
this
desperate
duel
the
light
was
too
low
for
it
they
struck
and
warded
that
was
all
while
grey
dick
stood
by
and
watched
grimly
some
more
fugitives
came
up
but
seeing
that
blows
passed
veered
off
to
the
left
for
of
blows
they
had
known
enough
that
day
the
swan
knight
missed
a
great
stroke
for
hugh
leapt
aside
then
as
the
frenchman
staggered
forward
struck
at
him
with
all
his
strength
the
heavy
sword
grasped
in
both
hands
for
hugh
had
thrown
aside
his
shield
caught
his
foe
where
neck
joins
shoulder
and
sank
through
his
mail
deep
into
the
flesh
beneath
down
he
went
it
was
finished
unlace
his
helm
dick
grasped
hugh
i
would
see
his
face
for
the
last
time
and
if
he
still
lives
dick
obeyed
cutting
the
lashings
of
the
helm
by
the
saints
he
said
presently
in
a
startled
voice
if
this
be
sir
edmund
acour
he
has
strangely
i
am
not
acour
lord
of
noyon
said
the
dying
man
in
a
hollow
voice
had
you
given
me
time
i
would
have
told
you
then
in
christ
s
name
who
are
you
asked
hugh
that
wear
de
noyon
s
cognizance
i
am
pierre
de
la
roche
one
of
his
knights
you
have
seen
me
in
england
i
was
with
him
there
and
you
made
me
prisoner
on
dunwich
heath
he
bade
me
change
arms
with
him
before
the
battle
promising
me
great
reward
because
he
knew
that
if
he
were
taken
edward
of
england
would
hang
him
as
a
traitor
whereas
me
they
might
ransom
also
he
feared
your
well
of
a
truth
you
have
the
reward
said
dick
looking
at
his
ghastly
wound
where
then
is
acour
gasped
hugh
i
know
not
he
fled
from
the
battle
an
hour
ago
with
the
king
of
france
but
i
who
was
doomed
would
not
fly
oh
that
i
could
find
a
priest
to
shrive
me
whither
does
he
fly
asked
hugh
again
i
know
not
he
said
that
if
the
battle
went
against
us
he
would
seek
his
castle
in
italy
where
edward
can
not
reach
what
armour
did
he
wear
asked
dick
mine
mine
a
wolf
upon
his
shield
a
wolf
s
head
for
hugh
reeled
as
though
an
arrow
had
passed
through
him
the
wolf
knight
acour
he
groaned
and
i
spared
his
a
very
foolish
deed
for
which
you
now
pay
the
price
said
dick
as
though
to
himself
we
met
in
the
battle
and
he
told
me
said
de
la
roche
speaking
very
slowly
for
he
grew
weak
yes
he
told
me
and
laughed
truly
we
are
fate
s
fools
all
of
us
and
he
smiled
a
ghastly
smile
and
died
hugh
hid
his
face
in
his
hands
and
sobbed
in
his
helpless
rage
the
innocent
slain
he
said
by
me
and
the
guilty
spared
by
me
oh
god
my
cup
is
full
take
his
arms
man
that
one
day
i
may
show
them
to
acour
and
let
us
be
going
ere
we
share
this
poor
knight
s
fate
ah
who
could
have
guessed
it
was
thus
that
i
and
sir
pierre
should
meet
and
part
chapter
x
the
king
s
champion
back
over
that
fearful
field
whereof
the
silence
was
broken
only
by
the
groans
of
the
wounded
and
the
dying
walked
hugh
and
grey
dick
they
came
to
the
great
rampart
of
dead
men
and
horses
that
surrounded
the
english
line
and
climbed
it
as
though
it
were
a
wall
on
the
further
side
bonfires
had
been
lit
to
lighten
the
darkness
and
by
the
flare
of
them
they
saw
edward
of
england
embracing
and
blessing
his
son
the
black
prince
who
unhelmeted
bowed
low
before
him
in
his
bloodstained
mail
who
were
they
besides
sir
robert
fitzsimmon
and
richard
de
beaumont
who
helped
you
when
you
were
down
my
son
asked
the
king
the
prince
looked
about
him
i
know
not
sire
many
but
here
is
one
of
them
and
he
pointed
to
hugh
who
just
then
appeared
within
the
circle
of
the
firelight
i
think
that
he
slew
the
count
louis
of
ah
said
the
king
our
young
merchant
of
dunwich
a
gallant
man
kneel
you
down
merchant
of
hugh
knelt
and
the
king
taking
the
red
sword
from
his
hand
struck
him
with
it
on
the
shoulder
saying
rise
sir
hugh
de
cressi
for
now
i
give
you
that
boon
which
your
deathfaced
servant
asked
before
the
battle
you
have
served
us
or
rather
england
well
both
of
you
but
whose
armour
is
that
the
archer
carries
sir
hugh
sir
edmund
acour
s
lord
de
noyon
sire
only
alack
another
man
was
within
the
your
meaning
said
the
king
briefly
and
in
few
words
hugh
told
the
tale
a
strange
story
sir
hugh
it
would
seem
that
god
fought
against
you
in
this
matter
also
i
am
wroth
my
orders
were
that
none
of
my
men
should
sally
out
though
i
fear
me
that
you
are
not
the
only
one
who
has
broken
them
and
for
your
great
deeds
i
forgive
sire
said
hugh
dropping
to
his
knee
again
a
boon
this
de
noyon
your
enemy
and
mine
has
cheated
and
mocked
me
grant
to
me
and
my
servant
richard
the
archer
permission
to
follow
after
him
and
be
avenged
upon
what
is
this
you
ask
sir
hugh
that
you
and
your
brave
henchman
should
wander
off
into
the
depths
of
france
there
to
perish
in
a
dungeon
or
be
hanged
like
felons
nay
nay
we
need
good
men
and
have
none
to
spare
for
private
quarrels
as
for
this
traitor
de
noyon
and
his
plot
that
egg
is
broken
ere
it
was
hatched
and
we
fear
him
no
more
you
follow
me
sir
hugh
and
your
servant
with
you
whom
we
make
a
captain
of
our
archers
until
calais
is
taken
leave
not
our
person
for
any
cause
and
ask
no
more
such
boons
lest
you
lose
our
favour
nay
we
have
no
more
words
for
you
since
many
others
seek
them
stand
back
sir
hugh
what
say
you
my
lord
of
warwick
ay
it
is
a
gruesome
task
but
let
the
welshmen
out
those
wounded
will
be
well
rid
of
their
pain
and
christ
have
mercy
on
their
souls
forget
not
when
it
is
finished
to
gather
all
men
that
they
may
give
thanks
to
god
for
his
great
well
nigh
a
year
had
gone
for
once
again
the
sun
shone
in
the
brazen
august
heavens
calais
had
fallen
at
last
only
that
day
six
of
her
noblest
citizens
had
come
forth
bearing
the
keys
of
the
fortress
clad
in
white
shirts
with
ropes
about
their
necks
and
been
rescued
from
instant
death
at
the
hands
of
the
headsman
by
the
prayer
of
queen
philippa
in
his
tent
sat
hugh
de
cressi
who
after
so
much
war
and
hardship
looked
older
than
his
years
perhaps
because
of
a
red
scar
across
the
forehead
which
he
had
come
by
during
the
siege
with
him
was
his
father
master
de
cressi
who
had
sailed
across
from
dunwich
with
a
cargo
of
provisions
whereof
if
the
truth
were
known
he
had
made
no
small
profit
for
they
were
sold
every
pound
of
them
before
they
left
the
ship
s
hold
though
it
is
true
the
money
remained
to
be
collected
you
say
that
eve
is
well
my
father
aye
well
enough
son
never
saw
i
woman
better
or
more
beautiful
though
she
wears
but
a
sad
face
i
asked
her
if
she
would
not
sail
with
me
and
visit
you
but
she
answered
nay
how
can
i
who
am
another
man
s
wife
sir
hugh
your
son
should
have
killed
the
wolf
and
let
the
poor
swan
go
when
the
wolf
is
dead
then
perchance
i
will
visit
him
but
meanwhile
say
to
him
that
red
eve
s
heart
is
where
it
always
was
and
that
like
all
dunwich
she
joys
greatly
in
his
fame
and
is
honoured
in
his
moreover
to
grey
dick
here
she
sends
many
messages
and
a
present
of
wines
and
spiced
foods
for
his
stomach
and
of
six
score
arrows
made
after
his
own
pattern
for
his
but
for
me
no
gift
father
said
hugh
nothing
son
save
her
love
which
she
said
was
enough
also
in
all
this
press
of
business
and
in
my
joy
at
finding
you
safe
i
had
almost
forgotten
it
there
is
a
letter
from
the
holy
father
sir
andrew
i
have
it
somewhere
in
my
pouch
amid
the
bills
of
exchange
and
he
began
to
hunt
through
the
parchments
which
he
carried
in
a
bag
within
his
robe
at
length
the
letter
was
found
it
ran
thus
to
sir
hugh
de
cressi
knight
my
beloved
godson
with
what
rejoicings
i
and
another
have
heard
of
your
knightly
deeds
through
the
letters
that
you
have
sent
to
us
and
from
the
mouths
of
wounded
soldiers
returned
from
the
war
your
honoured
father
will
tell
you
i
thank
god
for
them
and
pray
him
that
this
may
find
you
unhurt
and
growing
ever
in
glory
my
son
i
have
no
good
news
for
you
the
pope
at
avignon
having
studied
the
matter
if
indeed
it
ever
reached
his
own
ears
writes
by
one
of
his
secretaries
to
say
that
he
will
not
dissolve
the
alleged
marriage
between
the
count
of
noyon
and
the
lady
eve
of
clavering
until
the
parties
have
appeared
before
him
and
set
out
their
cause
to
his
face
therefore
eve
can
not
come
to
you
nor
must
you
come
to
her
while
de
noyon
lives
unless
the
mind
of
his
holiness
can
be
changed
should
france
become
more
quiet
so
that
english
folk
can
travel
there
in
safety
perchance
eve
and
i
will
journey
to
avignon
to
lay
her
plaint
before
the
holy
father
but
as
yet
this
seems
scarcely
possible
moreover
i
trust
that
the
traitor
acour
may
meet
his
end
in
this
way
or
in
that
and
so
save
us
the
necessity
for
as
you
know
such
cases
take
long
to
try
and
the
cost
of
them
is
great
moreover
at
the
court
of
avignon
the
cause
of
one
of
our
country
must
indeed
be
good
just
now
when
the
other
party
to
it
is
of
the
blood
of
france
soon
i
hope
to
write
to
you
again
who
at
present
have
no
more
to
say
save
that
notwithstanding
my
years
i
am
well
and
strong
and
would
that
i
sat
with
you
before
the
walls
of
calais
god
s
blessing
and
mine
be
on
you
and
to
richard
the
archer
greetings
dunwich
has
heard
how
he
shot
the
frenchman
before
the
great
battle
closed
and
the
townsfolk
lit
a
bonfire
on
the
walls
and
feasted
all
the
archers
in
his
honour
andrew
arnold
i
have
found
another
letter
said
master
de
cressi
when
hugh
had
finished
reading
which
i
remember
sir
andrew
charged
me
to
give
to
you
also
and
he
handed
him
a
paper
addressed
in
a
large
childish
hand
hugh
broke
its
silk
eagerly
for
he
knew
that
writing
hugh
it
began
simply
clement
the
pope
will
not
void
my
false
marriage
unless
i
appear
before
him
and
this
as
yet
i
can
not
do
because
of
the
french
wars
moreover
he
sets
the
curse
of
the
church
upon
me
and
any
man
with
whom
i
shall
dare
to
until
this
be
done
for
myself
i
would
defy
the
church
but
not
for
you
or
for
children
that
might
come
to
us
moreover
the
holy
father
sir
andrew
forbids
it
saying
that
god
will
right
all
in
his
season
and
that
we
must
not
make
him
wroth
therefore
hugh
lover
you
are
but
husband
you
may
not
be
while
de
noyon
lives
or
until
the
pope
gives
his
dispensation
of
divorce
which
latter
may
be
long
in
winning
for
the
knave
de
noyon
has
been
whispering
in
his
ear
hugh
this
is
my
counsel
get
you
to
the
king
again
and
crave
his
leave
to
follow
de
noyon
for
if
once
you
twain
can
come
face
to
face
i
know
well
how
the
fray
will
end
then
when
he
is
dead
return
to
one
who
waits
for
you
through
this
world
and
the
next
hugh
i
am
proud
of
your
great
deeds
no
longer
can
they
mock
you
as
the
merchant
s
son
sir
hugh
god
be
with
you
as
are
my
prayers
and
love
eve
i
forgot
to
tell
you
that
sir
andrew
is
disturbed
in
heart
he
looks
into
a
crystal
which
he
says
he
brought
with
him
from
the
east
and
swears
he
sees
strange
sights
there
pictures
of
woe
such
as
have
not
been
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
of
this
woe
he
preaches
to
the
folk
of
dunwich
warning
them
of
judgment
to
come
and
they
listen
affrighted
because
they
know
him
to
be
a
holy
man
who
has
a
gift
from
god
yet
he
says
that
you
and
i
eve
need
fear
nothing
may
it
be
so
now
when
he
had
thought
awhile
and
hidden
up
eve
s
letter
hugh
turned
to
his
father
and
asked
him
what
were
these
sermons
that
sir
andrew
preached
i
heard
but
one
of
them
son
answered
master
de
cressi
though
there
have
been
three
by
the
holy
mother
it
frightened
me
so
much
that
i
needed
no
more
of
that
medicine
nor
to
tell
truth
when
i
got
home
again
could
i
remember
all
he
said
save
that
it
was
of
some
frightful
ill
which
comes
upon
the
world
from
the
east
and
will
leave
it
and
what
think
folk
of
such
talk
father
indeed
son
they
know
not
what
to
think
most
say
that
he
is
mad
others
say
that
he
is
inspired
of
god
yet
others
declare
that
he
is
a
wizard
and
that
his
familiar
brings
him
tidings
from
cathay
where
once
he
dwelt
or
perchance
from
hell
itself
these
went
to
the
bishop
who
summoned
sir
andrew
and
was
closeted
with
him
for
three
hours
afterward
he
called
in
the
complainers
and
bade
them
cease
their
scandal
of
wizardry
since
he
was
sure
that
what
the
holy
father
said
came
from
above
and
not
from
below
he
added
that
they
would
do
well
to
mend
their
lives
and
prepare
to
render
their
account
as
for
his
part
he
should
also
since
the
air
was
thick
with
doom
then
he
gave
his
benediction
to
the
old
knight
and
turned
away
weeping
and
since
that
hour
none
talk
of
wizardry
but
all
of
judgment
men
in
dunwich
who
have
quarrelled
from
boyhood
forgive
each
other
and
sing
psalms
instead
of
swearing
oaths
and
i
have
been
paid
debts
that
have
been
owing
to
me
for
years
all
because
of
these
an
awesome
tale
truly
said
hugh
yet
like
this
bishop
i
believe
that
what
sir
andrew
says
will
come
to
pass
for
i
know
well
that
he
is
not
as
other
men
that
night
by
special
leave
hugh
waited
on
the
king
and
with
him
grey
dick
who
was
ever
his
shadow
what
is
it
now
sir
hugh
de
cressi
asked
edward
sire
after
the
great
battle
nigh
upon
a
year
ago
you
told
me
that
i
must
serve
you
till
calais
fell
i
have
served
as
best
i
could
and
calais
has
fallen
now
i
ask
your
leave
to
go
seek
my
enemy
and
yours
sir
edmund
acour
count
de
then
you
must
go
far
sir
hugh
for
i
have
tidings
that
this
rogue
who
was
not
ashamed
to
wear
another
man
s
armour
and
so
save
himself
from
your
sword
is
away
to
italy
this
six
months
gone
where
as
the
seigneur
de
cattrina
he
has
estates
near
venice
but
tell
me
how
things
stand
doubtless
that
red
eve
of
yours
strangely
enough
i
thought
of
her
at
crecy
when
the
sky
grew
so
wondrous
at
nightfall
is
at
the
bottom
of
that
is
so
sire
and
he
told
him
all
the
tale
a
strange
case
truly
sir
hugh
said
the
king
when
he
had
heard
it
out
i
ll
write
to
clement
for
you
both
but
i
doubt
me
whether
you
and
your
eve
will
get
justice
from
him
being
english
england
and
englishmen
find
little
favour
at
avignon
just
now
and
mayhap
philip
has
already
written
on
behalf
of
de
noyon
at
the
best
his
holiness
will
shear
you
close
and
keep
you
waiting
while
he
weighs
the
wool
no
red
eve
is
right
this
is
a
knot
soonest
severed
by
the
sword
if
you
should
find
him
de
noyon
could
scarce
refuse
to
meet
you
for
you
shall
fight
him
as
the
champion
of
our
cause
as
well
as
of
your
own
he
s
at
venice
for
our
envoy
there
reported
it
to
me
trying
to
raise
a
fresh
force
of
archers
for
the
french
you
have
leave
to
go
sir
hugh
who
deserve
much
more
having
served
us
well
went
on
the
king
we
ll
give
you
letters
to
sir
geoffrey
carleon
who
represents
us
there
and
through
him
to
the
doge
farewell
to
you
sir
hugh
de
cressi
and
to
you
captain
richard
the
archer
when
all
this
game
is
played
return
and
make
report
to
us
of
your
adventures
and
of
how
de
noyon
died
the
queen
will
love
to
hear
the
tale
and
your
nuptials
and
red
eve
s
shall
be
celebrated
at
westminster
in
our
presence
for
you
have
earned
no
less
master
secretary
get
your
tools
i
will
dictate
the
letters
after
they
are
signed
see
them
into
the
hands
of
sir
hugh
with
others
that
i
will
give
him
for
safe
carriage
for
alas
i
have
creditors
at
venice
make
out
an
open
patent
also
to
show
that
he
and
this
captain
travel
as
our
messengers
charging
all
that
do
us
service
to
forward
them
upon
their
three
days
later
hugh
and
grey
dick
in
the
character
of
royal
messengers
from
the
king
of
england
to
the
doge
of
venice
took
passage
in
a
great
vessel
bound
for
genoa
with
a
cargo
of
wool
and
other
goods
on
board
this
ship
before
he
sailed
hugh
handed
to
his
father
letters
for
eve
and
for
sir
andrew
arnold
also
he
received
from
him
money
in
plenty
for
his
faring
and
bills
of
exchange
upon
certain
merchants
of
italy
which
would
bring
him
more
should
it
be
needed
their
parting
was
very
sad
since
the
prophecies
of
sir
andrew
had
taken
no
small
hold
upon
master
de
cressi
s
mind
i
fear
me
greatly
dear
son
he
said
that
we
part
to
meet
no
more
well
such
is
the
lot
of
parents
they
breed
those
children
that
heaven
decrees
to
them
with
toil
and
thought
and
fears
they
rear
them
up
from
infancy
learning
to
love
them
more
than
their
own
souls
for
their
sakes
fighting
a
hard
world
then
the
sons
go
forth
north
and
south
and
the
daughters
find
husbands
and
joys
and
sorrows
of
their
own
and
both
half
forget
them
as
is
nature
s
way
last
of
all
those
parents
die
as
also
is
nature
s
way
and
the
half
forgetfulness
becomes
whole
as
surely
as
the
young
moon
grows
to
full
well
well
this
is
a
lesson
that
each
generation
must
learn
in
turn
as
you
will
know
ere
all
is
done
although
you
are
my
youngest
i
ll
not
shame
to
say
i
have
loved
you
best
of
all
hugh
moreover
i
ve
made
such
provision
as
i
can
for
you
who
have
raised
up
the
old
name
to
honour
and
who
as
i
hope
will
once
more
blend
the
de
cressis
and
the
claverings
the
foes
of
three
generations
into
a
single
speak
not
so
father
answered
hugh
who
was
moved
almost
to
tears
mayhap
it
is
i
who
shall
die
while
you
live
on
to
a
green
old
age
at
least
know
that
i
am
not
forgetful
of
your
love
and
kindness
seeing
that
after
eve
you
are
dearer
to
me
than
any
on
the
ay
ay
after
eve
and
eve
s
children
still
you
ll
have
a
kind
thought
for
me
now
and
then
the
old
merchant
who
so
often
thwarted
you
when
you
were
a
wayward
lad
for
your
own
good
as
he
held
for
what
more
can
a
father
hope
but
let
us
not
weep
before
all
these
stranger
men
farewell
son
hugh
of
whom
i
am
so
proud
farewell
son
hugh
and
he
embraced
him
and
went
across
the
gangway
for
the
sailors
were
already
singing
their
chanty
at
the
anchor
i
never
had
a
father
than
i
can
mind
said
grey
dick
aloud
to
himself
after
his
fashion
yet
now
i
wish
i
had
for
i
d
like
to
think
on
his
last
words
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
do
it
s
an
ugly
world
as
i
see
it
but
there
s
beauty
in
such
love
as
this
the
man
for
the
maid
and
the
maid
for
the
man
pish
they
want
each
other
but
the
father
and
the
mother
they
give
all
and
take
nothing
oh
there
s
beauty
in
such
love
as
this
so
perhaps
god
made
it
only
then
how
did
he
also
make
crecy
field
and
calais
siege
and
my
black
bow
and
me
the
death
who
draws
it
the
voyage
to
genoa
was
very
long
for
at
this
season
of
the
year
the
winds
were
light
and
for
the
most
part
contrary
at
length
however
hugh
and
dick
came
there
safe
and
sound
having
landed
and
bid
farewell
to
the
captain
and
crew
of
the
ship
they
waited
on
the
head
of
a
great
trading
house
with
which
master
de
cressi
had
dealings
this
signor
who
could
speak
french
gave
them
lodging
and
welcomed
them
well
both
for
the
sake
of
hugh
s
father
and
because
they
came
as
messengers
from
the
king
of
england
on
the
morrow
of
their
arrival
he
took
them
to
a
great
lord
in
authority
who
was
called
a
duke
this
duke
when
he
learned
that
one
was
a
knight
and
the
other
a
captain
archer
of
the
english
army
and
that
they
both
had
fought
at
crecy
where
so
many
of
his
countrymen
the
genoese
bowmen
had
been
slain
looked
on
them
somewhat
sourly
had
he
known
all
the
part
they
played
in
that
battle
in
truth
his
welcome
would
have
been
rough
but
hugh
with
the
guile
of
the
serpent
told
him
that
the
brave
genoese
had
been
slain
not
by
the
english
arrows
for
which
even
with
their
wet
strings
they
were
quite
a
match
here
dick
who
was
standing
to
one
side
grinned
faintly
and
stroked
the
case
of
his
black
bow
as
though
to
bid
it
keep
its
memories
to
itself
but
by
the
cowardly
french
their
allies
indeed
hugh
s
tale
of
that
horrible
and
treacherous
slaughter
was
so
moving
that
the
duke
burst
into
tears
and
swore
that
he
would
cut
the
throat
of
every
frenchman
on
whom
he
could
lay
hands
after
this
he
began
to
extol
the
merits
of
the
as
against
the
long
arm
of
the
english
and
hugh
agreed
that
there
was
much
in
what
he
said
but
grey
dick
who
was
no
courtier
did
not
agree
indeed
of
a
sudden
he
broke
in
offering
in
his
bad
french
to
fight
any
man
in
genoa
at
six
score
yards
so
that
the
duke
might
learn
which
was
the
better
weapon
but
hugh
trod
on
his
foot
and
explained
that
he
meant
something
quite
different
being
no
master
of
the
french
tongue
so
that
cloud
passed
by
the
end
of
it
was
that
this
duke
or
doge
whose
name
they
learned
was
simon
boccanera
gave
them
safe
conduct
through
all
his
dominion
with
an
order
for
relays
of
horses
also
he
made
use
of
them
to
take
a
letter
to
the
doge
of
venice
between
which
town
and
genoa
although
they
hated
each
other
bitterly
there
was
at
the
moment
some
kind
of
hollow
truce
so
having
drunk
a
cup
of
wine
with
him
they
bade
him
farewell
next
morning
the
horses
arrived
and
with
them
two
led
beasts
to
carry
their
baggage
in
charge
of
a
genoese
guide
so
they
departed
on
their
long
ride
of
something
over
two
hundred
english
miles
which
they
hoped
to
cover
in
about
a
week
in
fact
it
took
them
ten
days
for
the
roads
were
very
rough
and
the
slow
once
too
after
they
had
entered
the
territory
of
venice
they
were
set
on
in
a
defile
by
four
thieves
and
might
have
met
their
end
had
not
grey
dick
s
eyes
been
so
sharp
as
it
was
he
saw
them
coming
and
having
his
bow
at
hand
for
he
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
country
or
its
inhabitants
leaped
to
earth
and
shot
two
of
them
with
as
many
arrows
whereon
the
other
two
ran
away
before
they
went
however
they
shot
also
and
killed
a
so
that
the
englishmen
were
obliged
to
throw
away
some
of
their
gear
and
go
on
with
the
one
that
remained
at
length
on
the
eleventh
afternoon
they
saw
the
lovely
city
of
venice
sparkling
like
a
cluster
of
jewels
set
upon
its
many
islands
amid
the
blue
waters
of
the
adriatic
having
crossed
some
two
miles
of
open
water
by
a
ferry
which
plied
for
the
convenience
of
travellers
they
entered
the
town
through
the
western
gate
and
inquired
as
best
they
could
for
now
they
had
no
guide
the
genoese
having
left
them
long
before
for
the
house
of
sir
geoffrey
carleon
the
english
envoy
for
a
long
while
they
could
make
no
one
understand
indeed
the
whole
place
seemed
to
be
asleep
perhaps
because
of
the
dreadful
heat
which
lay
over
it
like
a
cloud
and
seemed
to
burn
them
to
the
very
bones
perplexed
and
outworn
at
last
hugh
produced
a
piece
of
gold
and
held
it
before
a
number
of
men
who
were
watching
them
idly
again
explaining
in
french
that
he
wished
to
be
led
to
the
house
of
the
english
ambassador
the
sight
of
the
money
seemed
to
wake
their
wits
for
two
or
three
of
the
fellows
ran
forward
quarrelling
with
each
other
till
one
of
them
getting
the
mastery
seized
hugh
s
tired
horse
by
the
bridle
and
dragged
it
down
a
side
street
to
the
banks
of
a
broad
canal
here
he
called
something
aloud
and
presently
two
men
appeared
rowing
a
large
punt
from
a
dock
where
it
was
hidden
into
this
boat
the
horses
and
were
driven
much
against
their
will
hugh
and
dick
having
followed
them
the
three
italians
began
to
punt
them
along
the
canal
which
was
bordered
with
tall
houses
a
mile
or
so
farther
on
it
entered
another
canal
where
the
houses
were
much
finer
and
built
in
a
style
of
which
they
had
never
seen
the
like
with
beautiful
and
fantastic
arches
supported
upon
pillars
at
length
to
their
great
joy
they
came
opposite
to
a
house
over
the
gateway
of
which
stirless
in
the
still
air
hung
a
flag
whereon
were
blazoned
the
leopards
of
england
here
the
boatmen
pulling
in
their
poles
save
one
to
which
they
made
the
punt
fast
in
showed
by
their
gestures
that
they
desired
to
be
paid
hugh
handed
the
piece
of
gold
to
the
man
who
had
led
them
to
the
boat
whereon
he
was
seized
with
a
fit
of
uncontrollable
fury
he
swore
he
raved
he
took
the
piece
of
gold
and
cast
it
down
on
the
he
spat
on
it
and
his
two
companions
did
likewise
surely
they
are
mad
said
hugh
mad
or
no
i
like
not
the
looks
of
them
answered
dick
have
a
care
they
are
drawing
their
knives
and
as
he
spoke
one
of
the
rogues
struck
him
in
the
face
while
another
strove
to
snatch
away
the
pouch
that
hung
at
his
side
now
grey
dick
awoke
as
it
were
to
the
man
who
had
tried
to
take
his
pouch
he
dealt
such
a
buffet
that
he
plunged
into
the
canal
but
him
who
had
struck
him
he
seized
by
the
arm
and
twisted
it
till
the
knife
fell
from
his
hand
then
gripping
his
neck
in
an
iron
grasp
he
forced
him
downward
and
rubbed
his
nose
backward
and
forward
upon
the
rough
edge
of
the
boat
for
the
italian
was
but
as
a
child
to
him
when
he
put
out
his
strength
in
vain
did
his
victim
yell
for
mercy
he
showed
him
none
till
at
length
wearying
of
the
game
he
dealt
him
such
a
kick
that
he
also
flew
over
the
thwarts
to
join
his
in
the
water
then
seeing
how
it
had
gone
with
his
companions
who
sorely
damaged
swam
to
the
farther
side
of
the
canal
and
vanished
the
third
man
he
whom
they
had
first
met
sheathed
his
knife
with
many
bows
and
cringes
he
pulled
up
the
pole
and
pushed
the
punt
to
the
steps
of
the
house
over
which
the
flag
hung
where
people
were
gathering
drawn
by
the
clamour
does
sir
geoffrey
carleon
dwell
here
asked
hugh
in
a
loud
voice
whereon
a
gentleman
with
a
pale
face
and
a
grizzled
beard
who
appeared
to
be
sick
for
he
was
leaning
on
a
staff
hobbled
from
out
the
porch
saying
ay
ay
that
is
my
name
who
are
you
that
make
this
tumult
at
my
gates
another
turbulent
englishman
i
ll
be
ay
sir
an
englishman
called
sir
hugh
de
cressi
and
his
companion
richard
the
archer
whom
these
rogues
have
tried
to
rob
and
murder
messengers
from
his
grace
king
now
sir
geoffrey
changed
his
tone
your
pardon
if
i
spoke
roughly
sir
hugh
but
we
poor
envoys
have
to
do
with
many
rufflers
from
our
own
land
enter
i
pray
you
my
servants
will
see
to
your
gear
and
horses
but
first
what
is
the
trouble
between
you
and
these
fellows
hugh
told
him
briefly
ah
he
said
a
common
trick
with
foreigners
well
for
you
that
night
had
not
fallen
since
otherwise
they
might
have
rowed
you
up
some
back
waterway
and
there
done
you
to
death
the
canals
of
venice
hide
the
traces
of
many
such
foul
deeds
mother
of
heaven
he
added
why
this
boatman
is
none
other
than
giuseppe
the
noted
bravo
and
he
turned
and
in
italian
bade
his
servants
seize
the
man
but
giuseppe
had
heard
enough
springing
into
the
water
he
swam
like
a
duck
for
the
farther
bank
of
the
canal
and
gaining
it
ran
swiftly
for
some
alley
where
he
vanished
he
s
gone
said
sir
geoffrey
and
as
well
hunt
with
a
lantern
for
a
rat
in
a
sewer
as
for
him
well
we
have
his
boat
which
shall
be
sent
to
the
magistrate
with
letters
of
complaint
only
sir
hugh
be
careful
to
wear
mail
when
you
walk
about
at
night
lest
that
villain
and
his
mates
should
come
to
collect
their
fare
with
a
stiletto
now
enter
and
fear
not
for
your
goods
my
folk
are
honest
god
s
name
how
fearful
is
this
heat
none
have
known
its
like
steward
give
me
your
an
hour
later
and
hugh
clad
in
fresh
garments
of
sweet
linen
bathed
and
shaved
sat
at
table
in
a
great
cool
room
with
sir
geoffrey
and
his
lady
a
and
woman
while
grey
dick
ate
at
a
lower
board
with
certain
of
the
envoy
s
household
i
have
read
the
letters
which
concern
the
business
of
his
grace
the
king
said
sir
geoffrey
who
was
toying
languidly
with
some
southern
fruits
for
he
would
touch
no
meat
they
have
to
do
with
moneys
that
his
grace
owes
to
great
bankers
of
this
city
but
does
not
yet
find
it
convenient
to
discharge
i
have
seen
their
like
before
and
must
deal
with
them
as
best
i
may
no
pleasant
business
for
these
usurers
grow
urgent
and
he
sighed
but
he
added
the
king
says
that
you
sir
hugh
de
cressi
whom
he
names
his
brave
trusty
and
most
well
beloved
knight
and
companion
in
war
and
he
bowed
courteously
to
hugh
have
another
business
which
he
commands
me
to
forward
by
every
means
in
my
power
and
that
without
fail
what
is
this
business
sir
hugh
it
is
set
out
sir
geoffrey
in
a
letter
from
his
grace
to
the
doge
of
venice
which
i
am
to
ask
you
to
deliver
here
it
is
be
pleased
to
read
it
it
is
the
envoy
took
the
letter
and
read
it
lifting
his
eyebrows
as
he
did
so
by
mark
he
s
the
right
saint
to
swear
by
in
venice
he
exclaimed
when
he
had
finished
this
is
a
strange
affair
you
have
travelled
hither
to
offer
single
combat
to
edmund
acour
count
of
noyon
and
seigneur
of
cattrina
the
doge
is
urged
by
his
friendship
to
the
throne
of
england
to
bring
about
this
combat
to
the
death
seeing
that
de
noyon
has
broken
his
oath
of
homage
has
plotted
to
overthrow
king
edward
has
fought
against
him
and
that
therefore
you
are
his
grace
s
champion
as
well
as
the
avenger
of
certain
private
wrongs
which
you
will
explain
that
s
the
letter
well
i
think
the
doge
will
listen
to
it
because
he
scarce
dare
do
otherwise
who
wishes
no
quarrel
with
our
country
just
now
when
it
is
victorious
also
this
de
noyon
whom
we
call
cattrina
here
has
allied
himself
with
certain
great
men
of
the
republic
with
whom
he
is
connected
by
blood
who
are
secret
enemies
to
the
doge
through
them
he
strives
to
stir
up
trouble
between
venice
and
england
and
to
raise
mercenaries
to
serve
the
flag
of
france
as
did
the
genoese
to
their
sorrow
therefore
i
think
that
in
the
doge
you
will
find
a
friend
i
think
also
that
the
matter
being
brought
forward
with
such
authority
the
seigneur
de
cattrina
will
scarcely
care
to
refuse
your
challenge
if
you
can
show
that
you
have
good
cause
for
quarrel
against
him
since
in
such
affairs
the
venetians
are
punctilious
but
now
tell
me
the
tale
that
i
may
judge
so
hugh
told
him
all
a
strange
story
and
a
good
cause
said
sir
geoffrey
when
he
had
done
only
this
cattrina
is
dangerous
had
he
known
you
came
to
venice
mayhap
you
had
never
lived
to
reach
my
house
go
armed
young
knight
especially
after
the
sun
sinks
i
ll
away
to
write
to
the
doge
setting
out
the
heads
of
the
matter
and
asking
audience
the
messenger
shall
leave
ere
i
sleep
if
sleep
i
may
in
this
heat
bide
you
here
and
talk
with
my
lady
if
it
so
pleases
you
for
i
would
show
you
my
letter
ere
we
bid
and
the
thing
is
pressing
we
must
catch
cattrina
before
he
gets
wind
of
your
presence
in
chapter
xi
the
challenge
how
long
is
it
since
you
have
seen
england
sir
hugh
asked
dame
carleon
languidly
some
eighteen
months
lady
although
in
truth
it
seems
more
for
many
things
have
happened
to
me
in
that
eighteen
months
only
why
tis
four
long
years
since
i
looked
upon
the
downs
of
sussex
which
are
my
home
the
dear
downs
of
sussex
that
i
shall
see
never
why
say
you
so
lady
who
should
have
many
years
of
life
before
you
because
they
are
done
sir
hugh
oh
in
my
heart
i
feel
that
they
are
done
that
should
not
grieve
me
since
my
only
child
is
buried
in
this
glittering
southern
city
whereof
i
hate
the
sounds
and
sights
that
men
call
so
beautiful
yet
i
would
that
i
might
have
been
laid
at
last
in
the
kind
earth
of
sussex
where
for
generations
my
forbears
have
been
borne
to
rest
and
suddenly
she
began
to
weep
what
ails
you
lady
you
are
not
well
oh
i
know
not
i
think
it
is
the
heat
or
some
presage
of
woe
to
come
not
to
me
only
but
to
all
men
look
nature
herself
is
sick
and
she
led
him
to
the
broad
balcony
of
the
chamber
and
pointed
to
long
lines
of
curious
mist
which
in
the
bright
moonlight
they
could
see
creeping
toward
venice
from
the
ocean
although
what
wind
there
was
appeared
to
be
off
land
those
fogs
are
unnatural
she
went
on
at
this
season
of
the
year
there
should
be
none
and
these
come
not
from
the
lagoons
but
up
from
the
sea
where
no
such
vapours
were
ever
known
to
rise
the
physicians
say
that
they
foretell
sickness
whereof
terrible
rumours
have
for
some
time
past
reached
us
from
the
east
though
none
know
whether
these
be
true
or
the
east
is
a
large
place
where
there
is
always
sickness
lady
or
so
i
have
ay
ay
it
is
the
home
of
death
and
i
think
that
he
travels
to
us
thence
and
not
only
i
not
only
i
half
the
folk
in
venice
think
the
same
though
why
they
can
not
tell
as
she
spoke
the
sound
of
solemn
chanting
broke
upon
hugh
s
ear
nearer
it
grew
and
nearer
till
presently
there
emerged
from
a
side
street
a
procession
of
black
monks
who
bore
in
front
of
them
a
crucifix
of
white
ivory
along
the
narrow
margin
which
lay
between
the
houses
and
the
canal
they
marched
followed
by
a
great
multitude
of
silent
people
it
is
a
dirge
for
the
dead
that
they
sing
said
dame
carleon
and
yet
they
bury
no
man
oh
months
ago
i
would
have
escaped
from
this
city
and
we
had
leave
to
go
but
then
came
orders
from
the
king
that
we
must
bide
here
because
of
his
creditors
so
here
we
bide
for
good
and
all
hush
i
hear
my
husband
coming
say
nothing
of
my
talk
it
angers
him
rest
you
well
sir
truly
that
lady
has
a
cheerful
mind
grumbled
grey
dick
when
she
had
gone
leaving
them
alone
upon
the
balcony
ten
minutes
more
of
her
and
i
think
i
should
go
hang
myself
or
squat
upon
these
stones
and
howl
at
the
moon
like
a
dog
or
those
whimpering
hugh
made
no
answer
for
he
was
thinking
of
his
father
s
tale
of
the
prophecies
of
sir
andrew
arnold
and
how
they
grew
sad
in
dunwich
also
in
truth
like
lady
carleon
he
found
it
in
his
heart
to
wish
that
he
too
were
clear
of
venice
which
he
had
reached
with
so
much
toil
bah
he
said
presently
this
place
stinks
foully
it
puts
me
in
mind
of
some
woman
most
beauteous
indeed
but
three
days
dead
let
us
go
on
the
following
morning
while
they
sat
at
breakfast
there
came
a
messenger
from
the
doge
of
venice
whose
name
hugh
learned
was
andrea
dandolo
bearing
a
letter
sealed
with
a
great
seal
this
letter
when
opened
was
found
to
be
from
some
high
officer
it
stated
that
the
doge
would
hold
a
court
at
noon
after
which
it
was
his
pleasure
to
receive
the
english
knight
who
came
as
a
messenger
from
the
mighty
monarch
king
edward
and
to
talk
with
him
on
matters
set
out
in
the
letter
of
sir
geoffrey
carleon
the
writing
added
that
the
seigneur
of
cattrina
who
in
france
was
known
as
the
count
de
noyon
and
in
england
as
sir
edmund
acour
would
be
present
at
the
court
and
doubtless
ready
to
answer
all
questions
that
might
be
put
to
him
then
at
last
we
shall
come
face
to
face
said
hugh
with
a
fierce
laugh
yes
master
put
in
dick
but
you
ve
done
that
several
times
before
and
always
ended
back
to
back
pray
the
saints
such
may
not
be
the
finish
of
this
meeting
then
he
turned
and
went
to
clean
his
master
s
armour
for
in
this
martial
dress
notwithstanding
the
great
heat
hugh
determined
to
appear
before
the
doge
it
was
good
armour
not
that
save
for
the
sword
which
sir
arnold
had
given
him
whereat
the
court
at
windsor
had
laughed
as
out
of
date
but
mail
of
a
newer
fashion
some
of
it
from
the
bodies
of
knights
who
fell
at
crecy
after
which
battle
such
wares
had
been
cheap
still
dick
could
have
wished
that
it
had
been
better
for
so
fine
an
occasion
seeing
that
it
was
marked
with
many
a
battle
dint
and
that
right
across
the
cressi
cognizance
which
hugh
had
painted
on
his
shield
after
he
was
knighted
a
golden
star
rising
from
an
argent
ocean
was
a
scar
left
by
the
of
a
calais
moreover
hugh
or
rather
dick
took
with
him
other
armour
namely
that
of
the
knight
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
whom
hugh
had
killed
at
crecy
thinking
that
he
was
edmund
acour
whose
mail
pierre
wore
for
the
rest
dick
clad
himself
in
his
uniform
of
a
captain
of
archers
of
king
edward
s
guard
wearing
a
green
tunic
over
his
mail
shirt
and
a
cap
from
which
rose
a
heron
s
plume
pinned
thereto
with
his
grace
s
golden
arrow
all
being
ready
they
started
in
a
painted
barge
accompanied
by
sir
geoffrey
carleon
who
wore
his
velvet
robe
of
office
and
grumbled
at
its
weight
and
warmth
a
row
of
some
fifteen
minutes
along
the
great
canal
brought
them
to
a
splendid
portal
upon
the
mole
with
marble
steps
hence
they
were
conducted
by
guards
across
a
courtyard
where
stood
many
gaily
dressed
people
who
watched
them
curiously
especially
grey
dick
whose
pale
sinister
face
caused
them
to
make
a
certain
sign
with
their
fingers
to
avert
the
evil
eye
as
sir
geoffrey
explained
to
them
leaving
this
courtyard
they
went
up
more
steps
and
along
great
corridors
into
the
finest
apartment
that
they
had
ever
seen
it
was
a
glitter
of
gold
and
marble
and
rich
with
paintings
here
on
a
kind
of
throne
sat
the
doge
dandolo
an
man
magnificently
attired
guards
stood
like
statues
behind
him
while
in
front
talking
together
and
moving
from
place
to
place
were
gathered
all
the
great
nobles
of
venice
with
their
beauteous
ladies
from
time
to
time
the
doge
summoned
one
or
other
of
these
who
was
called
to
him
by
a
secretary
advancing
with
bows
the
courtier
talked
to
him
a
while
then
was
dismissed
by
a
gracious
motion
of
the
hand
as
the
englishmen
entered
this
hall
a
herald
called
their
names
thus
from
a
written
slip
of
paper
the
cavalier
geoffrey
carleon
ambassador
of
england
the
cavalier
hugh
de
cressi
messenger
from
the
king
of
england
and
the
captain
richard
archer
his
now
all
talk
was
hushed
and
every
eye
turned
to
scan
these
strangers
of
whose
business
it
would
seem
something
was
already
known
a
fine
man
said
one
lady
to
another
of
hugh
but
why
does
he
come
here
in
dinted
armour
oh
he
is
english
and
the
english
are
barbarians
who
like
to
be
ready
to
cut
some
one
s
throat
answered
her
companion
but
holy
jesus
look
at
the
long
fellow
with
the
death
s
head
who
walks
behind
him
and
carries
his
luggage
in
a
sack
his
face
makes
my
back
fortunately
neither
hugh
nor
dick
understood
these
and
other
such
sayings
which
sir
geoffrey
repeated
to
them
afterward
and
therefore
walked
on
with
their
host
unconcerned
once
however
grey
dick
nudged
his
master
and
whispered
in
his
ear
be
glad
our
man
is
here
it
is
he
who
mocks
us
to
those
popinjays
nay
turn
not
to
look
you
will
see
plenty
of
his
sweet
face
now
they
stood
before
the
chair
of
state
from
which
the
doge
rose
and
advanced
two
steps
to
greet
the
ambassador
of
england
when
these
courtesies
were
over
sir
geoffrey
presented
hugh
to
him
to
whom
he
bowed
and
dick
whose
salute
he
acknowledged
with
a
wave
of
his
jewelled
hand
afterward
they
talked
all
crowding
round
to
listen
sir
geoffrey
himself
who
spoke
italian
well
acting
as
the
interpreter
you
come
hither
cavalier
de
cressi
said
the
doge
on
behalf
of
his
royal
grace
king
edward
who
speaks
of
you
in
his
letter
in
terms
of
which
any
knight
may
well
be
proud
we
understand
that
this
captain
with
you
is
your
companion
and
he
glanced
curiously
at
dick
out
of
the
corners
of
his
dark
eyes
adding
if
those
are
gifts
which
he
bears
in
that
leathern
sack
and
the
long
case
in
his
hand
let
our
servants
relieve
him
of
let
his
servants
leave
me
alone
growled
grey
dick
when
this
was
translated
say
to
this
fine
lord
sir
knight
that
the
gifts
in
the
sack
are
not
for
him
and
that
which
the
case
scatters
he
would
scarcely
care
to
sir
geoffrey
made
some
explanation
in
a
low
voice
and
with
a
smile
the
doge
waved
the
matter
by
then
said
will
the
noble
cavalier
be
so
good
as
to
set
out
his
business
unless
it
is
for
our
private
ear
alone
hugh
answered
that
it
was
for
the
public
ear
of
all
venice
and
especially
for
that
of
the
lord
who
was
called
sir
edmund
acour
in
england
the
count
de
noyon
in
france
and
the
seigneur
of
cattrina
in
italy
will
you
pleased
to
point
out
this
lord
to
us
said
the
doge
glancing
at
the
gorgeous
throng
which
was
gathered
behind
them
i
can
not
illustrious
doge
answered
hugh
that
is
with
certainty
as
it
chances
i
have
seen
his
face
but
twice
once
in
a
marsh
when
i
had
other
things
to
think
of
who
must
watch
my
enemy
s
sword
and
once
at
eve
in
the
corner
of
a
dark
chapel
where
he
had
just
gone
through
the
rite
of
marriage
with
a
lady
whom
he
had
drugged
which
lady
was
my
affianced
wife
often
afterward
i
sought
to
see
that
face
especially
in
the
great
fray
of
crecy
but
failed
in
a
case
which
with
your
leave
i
will
narrate
to
now
when
all
that
company
understood
the
meaning
of
these
outspoken
words
they
swayed
to
and
fro
and
whispered
like
reeds
in
an
evening
wind
presently
above
this
whispering
a
soft
yet
penetrating
voice
was
heard
to
say
if
this
english
knight
desires
to
study
the
poor
face
of
acour
de
noyon
and
cattrina
he
who
owns
it
is
much
honoured
and
prays
your
excellency
s
leave
to
wait
upon
his
so
saying
a
tall
and
man
who
wore
the
badge
of
a
white
swan
worked
in
pearls
upon
his
rich
tunic
stepped
forward
out
of
the
ring
of
courtiers
and
bowed
first
to
the
doge
and
next
to
hugh
de
cressi
looked
at
his
handsome
face
with
its
quick
dark
eyes
and
little
black
beard
and
answered
i
thank
you
sir
edmund
acour
for
i
take
it
you
are
he
now
i
shall
never
forget
you
again
for
though
a
man
may
shift
his
armour
he
can
not
change
his
countenance
a
saying
at
which
de
noyon
coloured
a
little
and
looked
down
uneasily
cavalier
de
cressi
he
whom
you
seek
is
before
you
we
ourselves
vouch
for
his
identity
said
the
doge
now
be
pleased
to
set
out
your
my
private
case
i
thrust
to
one
side
answered
hugh
sir
geoffrey
interpreting
all
the
time
for
it
is
a
matter
between
this
count
a
certain
lady
and
myself
and
can
wait
that
which
i
have
to
lay
before
you
illustrious
has
to
do
with
my
master
the
king
of
england
as
whose
champion
i
am
here
i
accuse
this
lord
of
the
three
names
of
black
treachery
to
his
august
liege
edward
all
details
of
which
treason
i
am
prepared
to
furnish
and
on
behalf
of
that
most
puissant
monarch
i
challenge
him
to
single
combat
as
i
am
empowered
and
commissioned
to
why
should
i
fight
the
king
of
england
s
bravoes
inquired
acour
in
a
languid
voice
of
those
who
stood
about
him
a
question
at
which
they
laughed
if
the
charge
of
treason
is
not
sufficient
went
on
hugh
i
ll
add
to
it
one
of
cowardice
at
the
battle
of
crecy
as
a
man
here
will
bear
me
witness
and
he
pointed
to
dick
i
overcame
in
single
combat
a
knight
who
wore
upon
his
shield
the
cognizance
of
a
wolf
and
on
his
helm
a
wolf
s
head
which
were
the
arms
of
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
at
this
knight
s
prayer
i
spared
his
life
for
that
day
we
took
no
prisoners
and
let
him
go
afterward
i
fought
with
another
knight
carrying
the
cognizance
of
a
white
swan
the
arms
of
the
count
de
noyon
and
slew
him
in
fair
and
single
fight
but
before
he
died
he
told
me
that
he
bore
that
armour
by
command
of
his
lord
the
count
de
noyon
and
that
the
said
count
fought
that
day
in
his
mail
because
he
feared
the
vengeance
of
the
king
of
england
and
my
own
thus
it
came
about
that
the
wolf
who
fought
paid
the
price
for
the
swan
who
fled
away
hid
in
the
armour
of
his
friend
whom
he
left
to
die
for
there
followed
a
great
silence
for
all
those
noble
lords
and
ladies
who
thought
little
of
treason
which
to
most
of
them
was
a
very
familiar
thing
were
not
a
little
stirred
by
this
tale
of
cowardice
and
false
arms
the
doge
said
noble
cattrina
you
have
heard
the
story
of
the
english
knight
what
do
you
answer
to
it
only
that
it
is
a
lie
illustrious
like
everything
else
that
he
has
told
us
replied
acour
with
a
shrug
of
his
broad
shoulders
you
said
that
you
had
a
witness
cavalier
de
cressi
said
the
doge
where
is
he
here
answered
hugh
stand
forward
dick
and
tell
what
you
dick
obeyed
and
in
his
low
rasping
voice
with
more
detail
than
hugh
had
given
set
out
the
story
of
those
two
combats
at
crecy
of
the
sparing
of
the
wolf
knight
and
the
slaying
of
the
swan
knight
what
say
you
now
noble
cattrina
asked
the
doge
i
say
that
the
man
lies
even
better
than
his
master
answered
acour
coolly
and
all
the
court
laughed
illustrious
said
hugh
doubtless
you
have
some
herald
at
your
court
i
pray
that
he
may
fetch
his
book
and
tell
us
what
are
the
arms
of
de
noyon
and
cattrina
with
all
their
colourings
and
the
doge
beckoned
to
an
officer
in
a
broidered
tabard
who
with
bows
without
needing
to
fetch
any
book
described
the
crest
and
arms
of
cattrina
in
full
particular
he
added
that
to
his
knowledge
these
were
borne
by
no
other
family
or
man
in
italy
france
or
england
then
you
would
know
them
if
you
saw
them
said
hugh
certainly
cavalier
on
it
i
stake
my
repute
as
a
now
while
all
wondered
what
this
talk
might
mean
the
doge
and
acour
most
of
any
although
the
latter
grew
uneasy
fearing
he
knew
not
what
hugh
whispered
to
dick
then
dick
loosed
the
mouth
of
the
leather
sack
he
carried
and
out
of
it
tumbled
on
to
the
marble
floor
a
whole
suit
of
armour
whence
came
these
asked
hugh
of
dick
off
the
body
of
the
night
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
whom
you
slew
at
crecy
i
stripped
him
of
them
whose
crest
and
cognizance
are
these
herald
asked
hugh
again
lifting
the
helm
and
shield
and
holding
them
on
high
that
all
might
see
the
herald
stepped
forward
and
examined
them
without
doubt
he
said
slowly
they
are
those
of
the
lord
of
cattrina
moreover
he
added
five
years
ago
i
limned
yonder
swan
upon
this
very
shield
with
my
own
hand
i
did
it
as
a
favour
to
cattrina
there
who
said
that
he
would
trust
the
task
to
none
but
an
now
the
silence
grew
intense
so
much
so
that
the
rustle
of
a
lady
s
dress
sounded
loud
in
the
great
hall
what
say
you
now
my
lord
of
cattrina
asked
the
doge
i
say
that
there
is
some
mistake
illustrious
even
if
there
were
none
he
added
slowly
for
their
own
good
and
lawful
purposes
knights
have
changed
armour
before
there
is
no
mistake
cried
hugh
in
a
ringing
voice
this
signor
of
so
many
names
is
a
signor
of
many
coats
also
which
he
can
change
to
save
his
skin
he
wore
that
of
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
to
protect
himself
from
the
vengeance
of
the
king
of
england
and
of
the
english
squire
whom
he
had
wronged
he
took
mercy
from
the
hand
of
that
squire
who
as
he
knew
well
would
have
shown
him
none
had
he
guessed
the
truth
he
left
the
poor
knight
whom
he
had
bribed
to
be
his
double
to
die
beneath
that
same
squire
s
hand
who
thought
him
named
de
noyon
therefore
the
blood
of
this
de
la
roche
is
on
his
head
yet
these
are
small
matters
of
private
conduct
and
one
that
is
greater
overtops
them
this
false
lord
as
sir
edmund
acour
swore
fealty
to
edward
of
england
yet
while
he
was
bound
by
that
sacred
oath
he
plotted
to
depose
edward
and
to
set
up
on
his
throne
the
duke
of
normandy
the
king
of
england
learned
of
that
plot
through
me
and
gave
me
charge
to
kill
or
capture
the
traitor
but
when
we
came
face
to
face
in
a
consecrated
church
where
i
thought
it
sacrilege
to
draw
sword
he
who
had
just
done
me
bitter
wrong
stayed
not
to
answer
the
wrong
he
slunk
away
into
the
darkness
leaving
me
felled
by
a
treacherous
blow
thence
he
fled
to
france
and
stirred
up
war
against
his
liege
lord
under
the
oriflamme
of
king
philip
now
that
this
banner
is
in
the
dust
he
has
fled
again
to
venice
and
here
as
i
have
heard
broods
more
mischief
once
when
after
the
sack
of
caen
i
sent
him
my
challenge
he
returned
to
me
an
insolent
answer
that
he
did
not
fight
with
merchants
sons
he
who
could
take
mercy
from
the
hand
of
a
merchant
s
son
now
that
for
deeds
done
a
king
has
made
me
knight
and
now
that
this
king
under
his
seal
and
sign
has
named
me
his
champion
in
your
presence
illustrious
and
in
that
of
all
your
court
i
challenge
cattrina
again
to
single
combat
to
the
death
with
lance
and
sword
and
dagger
yes
and
i
name
him
coward
and
scullion
if
he
refuses
this
king
edward
s
gage
and
mine
and
drawing
the
gauntlet
from
his
left
hand
hugh
cast
it
clattering
to
the
marble
floor
at
de
noyon
s
feet
a
babel
of
talk
broke
out
in
the
great
hall
and
with
it
some
and
clapping
of
hands
for
hugh
had
spoken
boldly
and
well
moreover
the
spectators
read
truth
in
his
grey
eyes
a
dark
figure
in
priest
s
robe
it
was
that
of
father
nicholas
the
secretary
who
had
brewed
red
eve
s
potion
glided
up
to
cattrina
and
whispered
swiftly
in
his
ear
then
the
doge
lifted
his
hand
and
there
was
silence
my
lord
of
cattrina
he
said
sir
hugh
de
cressi
speaking
as
the
champion
of
our
ally
the
king
of
england
has
challenged
you
to
single
combat
what
say
you
i
illustrious
he
answered
in
his
rich
voice
drawling
out
his
words
like
one
who
is
weary
oh
of
course
i
say
that
if
yon
brawler
wishes
to
find
a
grave
in
fair
venice
which
is
more
than
he
deserves
i
am
not
the
man
to
thwart
him
seeing
that
his
king
as
the
ambassador
of
that
king
i
protest
broke
in
sir
geoffrey
it
is
an
insult
that
such
a
word
should
be
used
before
i
accept
the
protest
of
his
excellency
who
forgot
his
noble
presence
replied
cattrina
bowing
back
seeing
that
his
king
who
is
not
a
here
a
titter
of
laughter
went
through
the
company
though
it
was
evident
from
the
frown
upon
his
face
that
the
doge
liked
the
jest
ill
has
chosen
to
make
a
knight
of
this
de
cressi
or
so
he
says
which
will
show
you
friends
all
how
hard
it
must
be
to
find
gentlemen
in
again
the
company
tittered
though
dick
s
grey
face
turned
scarlet
and
he
bit
upon
his
pale
lip
until
the
blood
ran
as
you
accept
the
challenge
broke
in
the
doge
shortly
cease
from
gibes
my
lord
which
more
befit
an
angry
woman
s
mouth
than
that
of
one
whose
life
is
about
to
be
put
to
hazard
and
take
up
the
gage
of
his
grace
of
cattrina
looked
round
and
bade
a
page
who
waited
on
his
person
obey
the
doge
s
command
saying
your
pardon
most
illustrious
if
i
do
not
touch
that
glove
myself
as
it
seems
somewhat
foul
i
think
it
must
have
served
its
owner
in
his
useful
labours
at
the
dyer
s
vat
before
his
master
made
him
now
it
was
hugh
s
turn
to
colour
but
when
he
understood
the
insult
grey
dick
could
contain
himself
no
more
ay
sir
cheat
and
traitor
he
said
in
his
hissing
voice
the
vat
in
which
it
has
been
dipped
was
that
of
the
of
your
dupe
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
and
of
many
a
nobler
norman
oh
did
we
not
stand
where
we
do
i
d
thrust
it
down
your
false
throat
and
with
it
twist
out
your
slanderous
peace
peace
cried
the
doge
while
those
present
who
understood
english
translated
dick
s
wild
words
to
their
neighbours
and
cattrina
laughed
mockingly
at
the
success
of
his
sneer
have
i
not
said
that
such
words
are
unseemly
ah
i
thought
it
well
my
lord
you
have
brought
it
on
for
while
he
spoke
the
page
a
mincing
young
man
tied
up
with
bows
and
ribbon
like
a
woman
had
lifted
the
glove
holding
it
between
his
thumb
and
forefinger
he
returned
it
to
hugh
with
a
low
mock
bow
being
careful
as
he
did
so
as
all
might
see
to
tread
upon
dick
s
foot
and
hustle
him
next
moment
two
things
happened
the
first
was
that
dropping
his
cased
bow
grey
dick
seized
that
young
in
his
iron
grip
and
hurled
him
into
the
air
so
that
he
fell
heavily
on
the
marble
floor
and
lay
there
stunned
the
blood
running
from
his
nose
and
mouth
the
second
was
that
seizing
his
gauntlet
hugh
strode
to
where
cattrina
stood
and
struck
him
with
it
across
the
face
saying
let
your
lips
kiss
what
your
fingers
are
too
fine
to
with
an
oath
cattrina
drew
his
sword
and
out
flashed
hugh
s
in
answer
as
he
cried
ay
here
and
now
if
you
will
here
and
now
then
the
guard
rushed
in
and
forced
them
apart
is
this
a
place
for
brawling
cried
dandolo
in
wrath
adding
yet
i
can
not
blame
the
englishmen
overmuch
seeing
that
they
were
sore
affronted
as
i
saw
with
my
eyes
and
heard
with
my
ears
be
silent
my
lord
of
cattrina
after
your
fashion
you
make
trouble
at
my
court
and
hearken
all
blood
so
hot
had
best
be
quickly
cooled
lest
one
or
other
of
these
knights
should
take
a
fever
moreover
the
noble
cattrina
has
but
asked
my
leave
to
ride
from
venice
having
urgent
business
at
avignon
at
the
court
of
pope
clement
so
i
decree
that
this
combat
shall
take
place
in
our
presence
on
the
campo
del
marte
three
hours
before
noon
ere
the
sun
grows
too
hot
to
all
the
details
of
the
combat
our
heralds
will
attend
forthwith
officer
take
soldiers
and
escort
the
ambassador
and
the
champion
of
his
grace
of
england
together
with
this
captain
of
archers
back
to
their
own
door
set
guards
there
and
see
that
none
molest
them
by
word
or
deed
under
pain
of
fine
and
strait
imprisonment
sir
geoffrey
carleon
your
requests
are
granted
be
pleased
to
write
it
to
the
most
puissant
edward
whom
you
serve
and
for
this
time
fare
you
well
why
what
is
it
captain
ambrosio
he
added
irritably
addressing
a
giant
of
a
man
clad
in
the
splendid
uniform
of
the
guard
who
stepped
before
his
throne
and
saluted
most
illustrious
said
ambrosio
in
bad
guttural
italian
my
mother
was
a
then
congratulations
to
the
swiss
ambrosio
but
what
of
it
very
illustrious
replied
the
captain
in
his
hollow
voice
the
swiss
are
brave
and
do
not
swallow
insults
that
lad
whom
the
englishman
kicked
or
smote
or
tossed
like
a
bull
and
he
pointed
to
the
poor
page
who
still
senseless
was
being
carried
from
the
hall
is
my
youngest
brother
who
resembles
our
venetian
father
somewhat
more
than
i
we
see
it
we
see
it
indeed
are
you
sure
that
the
father
was
and
the
doge
checked
himself
the
point
captain
we
would
illustrious
i
would
avenge
my
brother
and
myself
on
the
englishman
whom
i
will
beat
to
a
jelly
said
the
giant
i
crave
leave
to
fight
him
when
the
lord
cattrina
fights
his
master
and
advancing
toward
grey
dick
he
made
as
though
he
would
pull
his
nose
what
is
it
he
wants
asked
grey
dick
staring
up
at
the
great
fellow
with
a
look
in
his
eyes
that
caused
ambrosio
to
cease
flourishing
his
fists
the
challenge
was
translated
to
him
and
its
reason
oh
said
dick
tell
him
i
am
much
obliged
and
that
i
will
fight
him
with
the
bow
or
with
the
axe
and
dagger
or
with
all
three
then
we
will
see
whether
he
beats
me
to
a
jelly
or
whether
i
cut
him
into
collops
who
as
i
think
needs
now
the
captain
ambrosio
consulted
with
his
friends
who
with
much
earnestness
prayed
him
have
nothing
to
do
with
arrows
they
pointed
out
that
there
his
bulk
would
put
him
at
a
disadvantage
especially
in
dealing
with
an
english
archer
who
had
an
eye
like
a
snake
and
a
face
like
that
of
death
itself
in
short
one
and
all
they
recommended
the
and
the
dagger
as
his
most
appropriate
weapons
since
his
adversary
refused
swords
the
with
which
to
knock
him
down
as
he
could
easily
do
being
so
strong
and
the
dagger
with
which
to
finish
him
when
this
was
explained
to
grey
dick
he
assented
to
the
proposal
with
a
kind
of
unholy
joy
that
was
almost
alarming
to
those
who
saw
it
moreover
as
neither
of
them
had
gauntlets
to
throw
down
or
pick
up
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
seal
the
bargain
which
incautiously
enough
the
huge
swiss
accepted
dick
s
grasp
indeed
was
so
firm
and
long
that
presently
the
giant
was
observed
first
to
move
uneasily
secondly
to
begin
to
dance
and
thirdly
to
shout
out
with
pain
what
is
the
matter
asked
his
friends
the
matter
is
he
groaned
as
dick
let
go
that
this
son
of
satan
has
a
blacksmith
s
vise
in
place
of
a
hand
and
he
showed
his
great
fingers
from
beneath
the
nails
of
which
the
blood
was
oozing
his
venetian
companions
of
the
guard
looked
at
them
then
they
looked
at
grey
dick
and
gave
him
a
wide
berth
also
ambrosio
said
something
about
having
offered
to
fight
a
man
and
not
a
fiend
but
it
was
too
late
to
retract
for
the
doge
taking
as
was
natural
no
share
in
this
small
matter
had
already
left
his
throne
then
escorted
by
sir
geoffrey
and
the
city
guards
hugh
and
grey
dick
passed
through
that
splendid
company
away
home
to
dinner
dick
carrying
his
in
one
hand
and
the
sack
of
armour
which
de
noyon
had
not
thought
fit
to
claim
in
the
other
in
the
midst
of
dead
silence
they
departed
for
now
no
one
seemed
to
find
either
of
them
a
fit
subject
for
jest
indeed
there
were
some
who
said
as
they
watched
the
pair
pass
the
door
that
cattrina
and
the
giant
would
do
well
to
consult
a
lawyer
and
a
priest
that
night
chapter
xii
the
man
from
the
east
in
a
great
cool
room
of
his
splendid
venetian
palace
sir
edmund
acour
seigneur
of
cattrina
sat
in
consultation
with
the
priest
nicholas
clearly
he
was
ill
at
ease
his
face
and
his
quick
impatient
movements
showed
it
you
arrange
badly
he
said
in
a
voice
quite
devoid
of
its
ordinary
melodious
tones
everything
goes
wrong
how
is
it
you
did
not
know
that
this
accursed
englishman
and
his
death
were
coming
here
what
is
the
use
of
a
spy
who
never
spies
man
they
should
have
been
met
upon
the
road
for
who
can
be
held
answerable
for
what
brigands
do
or
at
the
least
i
might
have
started
for
avignon
two
days
am
i
omnipotent
lord
that
i
should
be
held
able
to
read
the
minds
of
men
in
far
countries
and
to
follow
their
footsteps
asked
the
aggrieved
nicholas
still
it
might
have
been
guessed
that
this
bulldog
of
a
briton
would
hang
to
your
heels
till
you
kick
out
his
brains
or
he
pulls
you
down
bah
the
sight
of
that
archer
who
can
not
miss
always
gives
me
a
cold
pain
in
the
stomach
as
though
an
were
working
through
my
vitals
i
pity
yonder
poor
fool
of
a
swiss
for
what
chance
has
he
against
a
wizard
ten
thousand
curses
on
the
swiss
said
acour
he
thrust
himself
into
the
affair
and
will
deserve
all
he
gets
i
pity
myself
you
know
i
am
no
coward
as
not
a
few
have
learned
before
but
i
have
little
luck
against
this
englishman
i
tell
you
that
there
at
crecy
i
went
down
before
him
like
a
ninepin
and
he
spared
my
life
my
god
he
spared
my
life
being
a
fool
like
all
his
breed
and
now
the
tale
is
known
against
me
and
that
of
the
changed
armour
too
why
could
not
de
la
roche
die
without
speaking
the
faithless
hound
whom
i
had
fed
so
well
so
so
regrets
are
vain
de
cressi
is
here
and
must
be
faced
or
i
be
you
may
be
killed
as
well
as
shamed
nicholas
suggested
unpleasantly
it
is
certain
that
either
you
or
that
englishman
will
die
since
he
s
set
for
no
fancy
tilting
with
waving
of
ladies
kerchiefs
and
tinsel
crowns
of
victory
and
so
forth
merchant
bred
or
not
he
is
a
sturdy
fighter
as
we
all
learned
in
france
moreover
his
heart
is
full
with
wrong
and
the
man
whose
quarrel
is
just
is
always
to
be
a
pest
on
you
snarled
cattrina
have
you
the
evil
eye
that
you
then
croak
disaster
in
my
ears
look
you
priest
i
must
come
through
this
game
unharmed
death
is
a
companion
i
do
not
seek
just
yet
who
have
too
much
to
live
for
power
and
wealth
and
high
renown
if
my
plans
succeed
and
as
you
should
know
they
are
well
laid
moreover
there
is
that
english
girl
red
eve
my
wife
from
whose
sweet
side
you
made
me
flee
i
tell
you
nicholas
i
burn
for
her
and
had
rather
taste
her
hate
than
the
love
of
any
other
woman
on
the
earth
now
too
the
pope
has
summoned
me
to
avignon
and
her
also
to
lay
our
causes
before
him
being
bold
mayhap
she
will
come
for
his
holiness
has
sent
her
under
his
own
hand
nor
has
he
mentioned
for
i
saw
a
copy
of
the
brief
that
the
same
business
will
take
me
to
avignon
about
this
time
well
if
she
comes
she
will
not
go
away
again
alone
the
french
roads
are
too
rough
for
ladies
to
travel
unescorted
and
if
she
does
not
come
at
least
our
marriage
will
be
declared
valid
and
i
ll
take
her
when
and
where
i
can
and
her
wealth
with
her
which
will
be
only
then
lord
you
must
not
die
nor
even
be
wounded
it
is
the
englishman
who
should
die
for
whatever
the
pope
may
decree
i
think
that
while
de
cressi
lives
the
slumbrous
eyes
of
that
eve
of
yours
will
find
a
way
to
charm
you
to
a
sleep
that
has
no
wakening
she
is
not
a
toy
that
weeps
forgets
and
at
last
grows
happy
in
her
babe
she
s
a
woman
to
make
men
or
break
them
oh
when
her
sense
came
back
to
her
for
a
flash
she
looked
me
cold
yonder
in
that
english
chapel
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
god
s
curse
was
in
her
you
ve
caught
the
terror
nicholas
like
so
many
just
now
in
venice
why
i
ve
not
met
a
man
or
woman
who
is
not
afraid
of
something
they
know
not
what
save
the
englishman
and
his
death
i
think
tis
the
unwholesome
air
of
this
strange
season
and
all
the
signs
and
omens
we
hear
of
on
every
side
that
conjure
vapours
to
the
yes
i
ve
the
terror
said
nicholas
with
something
like
a
groan
every
sin
i
ever
did
and
most
of
them
have
been
for
you
lord
seems
to
haunt
my
sleep
yes
and
to
walk
with
me
when
i
wake
preaching
woe
at
me
with
fiery
tongues
that
repentance
or
absolution
can
not
quench
or
yet
nicholas
i
think
that
you
must
add
one
more
to
their
count
or
a
share
of
it
which
should
weigh
light
among
so
many
either
i
or
de
cressi
must
pack
for
our
last
journey
and
if
we
meet
face
to
face
how
know
i
that
it
will
be
de
cressi
better
far
that
we
should
not
lord
lord
you
can
not
fly
he
is
king
edward
s
champion
so
proclaimed
before
all
whose
names
are
written
in
the
golden
book
of
venice
he
would
cry
your
shame
in
every
court
and
so
would
they
there
s
not
a
knight
in
europe
but
would
spit
upon
you
as
a
dastard
or
a
common
wench
but
would
turn
you
her
back
you
can
not
fly
nay
fool
but
he
can
die
and
before
what
makes
your
brain
so
dull
nicholas
it
is
not
its
ah
i
see
not
flight
murder
i
had
forgotten
it
is
not
a
usual
sauce
to
a
banquet
of
honour
even
in
italy
and
therefore
perhaps
the
safer
to
serve
but
how
is
it
to
be
done
poison
he
is
in
carleon
s
house
carleon
has
faithful
servants
though
perhaps
a
basket
of
rare
fruits
but
then
he
might
not
eat
them
those
englishmen
live
mostly
on
meat
the
signora
would
probably
eat
them
and
the
nay
no
more
of
your
drugs
your
skill
in
them
is
too
well
known
come
these
men
have
been
watched
since
they
set
foot
in
venice
have
they
offended
none
besides
myself
and
the
swiss
a
look
of
intelligence
crept
into
the
eyes
of
nicholas
now
that
you
mention
it
lord
they
have
there
is
a
certain
boatman
and
bravo
called
giuseppe
with
him
and
his
mates
they
quarrelled
about
their
fare
and
threw
them
into
the
canal
in
front
of
the
ambassador
s
house
just
because
they
drew
a
knife
or
two
a
woman
i
know
told
me
of
it
he
s
a
great
villain
this
giuseppe
who
would
do
anything
for
ten
pieces
also
revengeful
and
a
hater
of
cold
send
for
him
nicholas
or
send
this
woman
to
him
that
may
be
safer
ten
pieces
i
ll
pay
him
ay
lord
but
the
englishman
may
not
give
him
a
chance
only
fools
would
go
out
walking
in
venice
along
after
dark
if
they
should
happen
to
have
enemies
here
and
the
house
is
watched
by
the
doge
s
guards
yet
one
can
try
fortune
loves
the
brave
and
englishmen
are
very
great
fools
they
might
stroll
abroad
to
see
the
moon
rise
over
the
try
nicholas
try
as
you
never
tried
before
succeed
too
lest
you
and
i
should
part
company
and
you
never
be
named
abbot
after
the
afternoon
of
the
day
of
their
reception
by
the
doge
was
well
filled
for
hugh
and
dick
scarcely
had
they
eaten
with
their
host
when
the
marshal
and
his
officers
arrived
with
the
articles
of
the
morrow
s
combat
very
fully
drawn
up
each
of
which
must
be
considered
with
the
help
of
sir
geoffrey
carleon
lest
they
should
hide
some
trick
before
they
confirmed
them
with
their
signatures
not
that
hugh
was
about
the
details
as
he
said
to
sir
geoffrey
all
he
sought
was
to
come
face
to
face
with
his
enemy
even
if
he
had
but
a
club
for
a
weapon
at
length
these
articles
were
signed
and
the
marshal
departed
with
his
fee
for
they
must
be
paid
for
as
though
they
were
a
legal
document
next
hugh
must
try
various
horses
from
sir
geoffrey
s
stable
and
choose
one
of
them
as
his
war
steed
for
the
morrow
since
the
beast
he
had
ridden
to
venice
was
in
no
condition
to
bear
a
knight
in
the
end
he
selected
a
grey
gelding
quiet
of
temperament
and
rather
heavy
of
build
which
it
was
reported
had
been
used
by
its
former
owner
in
several
tournaments
and
there
borne
itself
handsomely
this
done
well
or
ill
his
armour
must
be
seen
to
and
dick
s
also
such
as
it
was
his
lance
tested
and
all
their
other
weapons
sharpened
on
a
whetstone
that
sir
geoffrey
borrowed
for
this
was
a
task
that
grey
dick
would
leave
to
no
other
hand
at
length
all
was
prepared
as
well
as
possible
in
such
haste
and
they
went
to
supper
with
lady
carleon
who
now
she
understood
that
they
were
to
fight
for
their
lives
on
the
morrow
was
more
mournful
even
than
she
had
been
on
the
previous
night
when
at
last
she
asked
what
they
desired
as
to
their
funerals
and
if
they
had
any
tokens
to
be
sent
to
friends
in
england
hugh
whose
thoughts
were
already
sad
enough
could
bear
no
more
of
it
so
he
rose
saying
that
he
would
seek
sir
geoffrey
who
was
already
in
his
cabinet
engaged
upon
a
letter
to
king
edward
descriptive
of
these
events
and
other
business
but
when
they
were
out
of
the
room
he
said
that
he
must
have
fresh
air
or
he
would
faint
which
was
not
strange
seeing
that
heat
prevailed
on
this
night
in
venice
of
an
intensity
unknown
there
at
this
season
of
the
year
whither
shall
we
go
asked
dick
mopping
his
brow
guards
stand
at
the
door
and
i
doubt
will
not
let
us
i
wish
to
see
the
place
where
we
are
to
fight
answered
hugh
so
as
to
form
my
judgment
of
it
if
only
we
may
come
at
this
moment
an
english
lad
of
sir
geoffrey
s
household
chanced
to
pass
by
having
come
to
ask
as
to
the
feeding
of
the
horse
which
hugh
should
ride
dick
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
asked
whether
he
could
get
them
out
of
the
house
secretly
so
that
the
guards
would
not
see
them
and
conduct
them
to
the
spot
called
the
place
of
arms
where
they
understood
they
were
to
fight
the
lad
whose
name
was
david
day
replied
somewhat
doubtfully
that
he
could
do
so
by
a
back
door
near
the
kitchen
and
guide
them
also
but
that
they
must
protect
him
from
the
anger
of
sir
geoffrey
this
hugh
promised
to
do
so
presently
they
started
carrying
their
weapons
but
wearing
no
mail
because
of
the
intense
heat
although
dick
reminded
his
master
how
they
had
been
told
that
they
should
not
venture
forth
without
body
armour
i
have
a
sword
and
you
have
bow
and
axe
answered
hugh
so
we
ll
risk
it
in
mail
we
should
surely
so
they
put
on
some
light
cloaks
made
of
black
silk
with
hoods
to
them
such
as
the
venetians
wore
at
their
masques
for
david
knew
where
these
were
to
be
found
slipping
out
quite
unobserved
by
the
kitchen
door
into
a
little
courtyard
they
passed
into
an
unlighted
back
street
through
a
postern
gate
whereof
the
lad
had
the
key
at
the
end
of
the
street
they
came
to
a
canal
where
david
who
talked
italian
perfectly
hailed
a
boat
into
which
they
entered
without
exciting
remark
for
this
sharp
youth
pointed
to
their
cloaks
and
told
the
boatman
that
they
were
gallants
engaged
upon
some
amorous
adventure
on
they
rowed
down
the
silent
lanes
of
water
through
the
slumbrous
city
of
palaces
turning
here
turning
there
till
soon
they
lost
all
knowledge
of
the
direction
in
which
they
headed
at
length
david
whispered
to
them
that
they
drew
near
the
place
where
they
must
land
everybody
seemed
to
speak
in
a
whisper
that
heavy
night
even
the
folk
generally
so
light
of
heart
and
quick
of
tongue
who
sat
on
the
steps
or
beneath
the
porticoes
of
their
houses
gasping
for
air
and
the
on
the
or
footwalks
that
bordered
the
canals
at
a
sign
from
david
the
boat
turned
inward
and
grated
against
the
steps
of
a
marble
quay
he
paid
the
boatman
who
seemed
to
have
no
energy
left
to
dispute
the
fare
telling
him
in
the
same
low
voice
that
if
he
cared
to
wait
he
might
perhaps
row
them
back
within
an
hour
or
so
then
they
climbed
steps
and
entered
a
narrow
street
where
there
was
no
canal
on
either
side
of
which
stood
tall
houses
or
dark
frowning
gateways
just
as
they
stepped
into
the
shadow
of
this
street
they
heard
the
prow
of
another
boat
grate
against
the
marble
steps
behind
them
and
caught
the
faint
sound
of
talk
apparently
between
their
rower
and
others
in
the
second
boat
forward
sir
hugh
said
day
a
little
nervously
this
part
of
venice
has
no
good
name
for
many
wicked
deeds
are
done
here
but
soon
we
shall
be
through
so
they
stepped
out
briskly
and
when
they
were
about
down
the
street
heard
other
steps
behind
them
they
turned
and
looked
back
through
the
gloom
whereon
the
sound
of
the
following
steps
died
away
they
pushed
on
again
and
so
unless
the
echo
deceived
them
did
those
quick
stealthy
steps
then
as
though
by
common
consent
though
no
one
gave
the
word
they
broke
into
a
run
and
gained
the
end
of
the
street
which
they
now
saw
led
into
a
large
open
space
lit
by
the
light
of
the
great
moon
that
broke
suddenly
through
the
veil
of
cloud
or
mist
again
as
though
by
common
consent
they
wheeled
round
hugh
drawing
his
sword
and
perceived
emerging
from
the
street
six
or
seven
cloaked
fellows
who
on
catching
sight
of
the
flash
of
steel
halted
and
melted
back
into
the
gloom
who
follow
us
so
fast
asked
hugh
thieves
i
think
answered
david
even
more
nervously
than
before
adding
but
if
so
we
are
safe
from
them
yes
sure
enough
said
grey
dick
for
i
can
shoot
by
moonlight
and
drawing
the
black
bow
from
its
case
which
he
threw
to
the
lad
to
carry
he
strung
it
after
which
they
saw
no
more
of
their
pursuers
having
waited
a
while
they
began
to
examine
the
spot
where
they
found
themselves
which
day
told
them
was
that
place
of
arms
where
they
must
fight
on
the
morrow
it
was
large
and
level
having
been
used
as
a
drilling
ground
for
generations
perhaps
it
measured
four
hundred
yards
square
and
almost
in
the
centre
of
it
rose
a
stand
of
painted
timber
roofed
with
canvas
and
ornamented
with
gilded
flagstaffs
from
which
hung
banners
on
this
stand
david
said
the
doge
and
nobles
would
take
their
seats
to
see
the
fray
for
in
front
of
it
the
charging
knights
must
meet
they
walked
up
and
down
the
course
taking
note
of
everything
and
especially
of
how
the
sun
would
shine
upon
them
and
the
foothold
of
the
soil
which
appeared
to
be
formed
of
fine
trodden
sand
i
ask
no
better
ground
to
fight
on
said
hugh
at
length
though
it
is
strange
to
think
he
added
with
a
sigh
that
here
within
a
dozen
hours
or
so
two
men
must
bid
the
world
ay
answered
dick
who
alone
seemed
untouched
by
the
melancholy
of
that
night
here
will
die
the
knave
with
three
names
and
the
big
fool
of
a
swiss
and
descend
to
greet
their
ancestors
in
a
place
that
is
even
hotter
than
this
venice
with
but
a
sorry
tale
to
tell
them
by
george
i
wish
it
were
nine
of
the
clock
brag
not
dick
said
hugh
with
a
sad
smile
for
war
is
an
uncertain
game
and
who
knows
which
of
us
will
be
talking
with
his
ancestors
and
praying
the
mercy
of
his
maker
by
this
time
night
then
having
learned
all
they
could
they
walked
across
the
ground
to
the
quay
that
bordered
it
on
the
seaward
side
here
as
they
guessed
from
the
stone
pillars
to
which
ships
were
made
fast
was
one
of
the
harbours
of
venice
although
as
it
happened
none
lay
at
that
quay
this
night
yet
as
they
looked
they
saw
one
coming
in
watched
curiously
by
groups
of
men
gathered
on
the
wall
never
knew
i
vessel
make
harbour
in
such
a
fashion
exclaimed
dick
presently
see
she
sails
stern
hugh
studied
her
and
saw
that
she
was
a
great
decked
galley
of
many
oars
such
as
the
venetians
used
in
trading
to
the
east
and
pooped
but
the
strange
thing
was
that
none
worked
these
oars
which
although
they
were
lashed
swung
to
and
fro
aimlessly
some
yet
whole
and
some
with
their
blades
broken
off
and
their
shafts
bundles
of
jagged
splinters
certain
sails
were
still
set
on
the
ship
s
mast
in
tatters
for
the
most
part
though
a
few
remained
sound
and
it
was
by
these
that
she
moved
for
with
the
moonrise
a
faint
wind
had
sprung
up
lastly
she
showed
no
light
at
peak
or
poop
and
no
sound
of
officer
s
command
or
of
boatswain
s
whistle
came
from
her
deck
only
slowly
and
yet
as
though
of
set
purpose
she
drifted
in
toward
the
quay
those
who
watched
her
sailors
such
as
ever
linger
about
harbours
seeking
their
bread
from
the
waters
though
among
these
were
mingled
people
from
the
town
who
had
come
to
this
open
place
to
escape
the
heat
began
to
talk
together
affrightedly
but
always
in
the
dread
whisper
that
was
the
voice
of
this
fearful
knight
yes
even
the
sailormen
whispered
like
a
dying
woman
she
s
no
ship
said
one
she
s
the
wraith
of
a
ship
when
i
was
a
lad
i
saw
such
a
craft
in
the
indian
seas
and
afterward
we
foundered
and
i
and
the
cook
s
mate
alone
were
pshaw
answered
another
she
s
a
ship
right
enough
look
at
the
weed
and
barnacles
on
her
sides
when
she
heaves
only
where
in
christ
s
name
are
her
crew
yes
said
a
third
and
how
could
she
win
through
all
the
secret
channels
without
a
pilot
what
use
would
be
a
pilot
said
a
fourth
if
there
are
none
to
work
the
rudder
and
shift
the
sails
do
i
not
know
who
am
of
the
trade
at
least
she
is
coming
straight
to
the
quay
exclaimed
a
fifth
though
what
sends
her
satan
alone
knows
for
the
tide
is
slack
and
this
wind
would
scarce
move
a
sponge
boat
stand
by
with
the
hawser
or
she
ll
swing
round
and
stave
herself
against
the
so
they
talked
and
all
the
while
the
great
galley
drifted
onward
with
a
slow
majestic
motion
her
decks
hid
in
shadow
for
a
sail
cut
off
the
light
of
the
low
moon
from
them
presently
too
even
this
was
gone
for
the
veil
of
cloud
crept
again
over
the
moon
s
face
obscuring
everything
then
of
a
sudden
a
meteor
blazed
out
in
the
sky
such
a
meteor
as
no
living
man
had
ever
seen
in
venice
for
the
size
of
it
was
that
of
the
sun
it
seemed
to
rise
out
of
the
ocean
to
the
east
and
to
travel
very
slowly
across
the
whole
arc
of
the
firmament
till
at
last
it
burst
with
a
terrible
noise
over
the
city
and
vanished
while
it
shone
the
light
it
gave
was
that
of
only
pale
blue
in
colour
turning
all
it
touched
to
a
livid
and
unnatural
white
it
showed
the
placid
sea
and
fish
leaping
on
its
silver
face
or
more
away
it
showed
the
distant
land
with
every
rock
and
house
and
bush
it
showed
the
wharf
and
the
watchers
on
it
among
them
hugh
noted
a
man
embracing
his
sweetheart
as
he
thought
under
cover
of
the
cloud
but
most
of
all
it
showed
that
galley
down
to
her
last
rope
and
even
the
lines
of
caulking
on
her
deck
oh
and
now
they
saw
the
rowers
for
they
lay
in
heaps
about
the
oars
some
of
them
even
hung
over
these
limply
moving
to
and
fro
as
they
swung
while
others
were
stretched
upon
the
benches
as
though
they
slept
they
were
dead
all
dead
the
wind
following
the
meteor
and
blowing
straight
on
shore
told
them
that
they
were
certainly
all
dead
three
hundred
men
and
more
upon
that
great
ship
and
all
dead
nay
not
all
for
now
on
the
high
poop
stood
a
single
figure
who
seemed
to
wear
a
strange
red
and
about
his
shoulders
a
black
robe
straight
and
silent
he
stood
a
very
fearful
figure
and
in
his
hand
a
coil
of
rope
the
sight
of
him
sent
those
watchers
mad
they
ceased
from
their
whisperings
they
raved
aloud
it
is
satan
they
shouted
satan
who
comes
to
drag
the
folk
of
venice
down
to
hell
kill
him
ere
he
lands
kill
him
even
grey
dick
went
mad
like
a
dog
when
he
meets
a
ghost
his
pale
hair
rose
upon
his
head
his
cold
quiet
eyes
started
he
set
an
arrow
on
the
string
of
the
black
bow
drew
it
to
his
ear
and
loosed
at
the
figure
on
the
poop
but
that
arrow
never
left
the
string
it
shattered
to
flinders
where
it
was
and
fell
tinkling
to
the
marble
floor
only
the
barb
of
it
turned
and
wounded
grey
dick
in
the
chin
yes
and
stuck
there
for
a
while
for
his
right
arm
was
numbed
so
that
he
could
not
lift
his
hand
to
pull
it
forth
truly
i
have
shot
at
the
fiend
and
hit
that
at
which
i
did
not
aim
muttered
grey
dick
and
sat
himself
down
on
a
post
of
the
quay
to
consider
the
matter
only
as
it
seemed
to
him
he
who
stood
on
the
poop
of
the
ship
not
ten
yards
away
smiled
a
little
unheeding
of
the
clamour
this
man
upon
the
poop
suddenly
lifted
the
coil
of
rope
and
threw
it
shoreward
it
was
a
thick
and
heavy
rope
with
a
noose
at
its
end
so
heavy
that
none
would
have
believed
that
one
mortal
could
handle
it
yet
it
shot
from
him
till
it
stood
out
stiff
as
an
iron
bar
yes
and
the
noose
fell
over
one
of
the
stone
posts
on
the
quay
and
caught
there
now
the
rope
grew
straighter
still
stretching
and
groaning
like
a
thing
in
pain
as
it
took
the
weight
of
the
great
drifting
ship
she
stayed
she
swung
round
slowly
and
ranged
herself
broadside
on
against
the
quay
as
a
berthed
ship
does
then
down
the
ladder
on
her
side
came
the
man
deliberately
he
set
his
feet
upon
the
quay
advanced
a
few
paces
into
the
full
light
of
the
bright
moon
and
stood
still
as
though
to
suffer
himself
to
be
seen
of
every
eye
truly
he
was
worth
the
seeing
hugh
noted
his
garments
first
and
particularly
the
which
caught
his
glance
and
held
it
for
never
had
he
known
such
a
one
before
it
was
a
cap
fitting
tight
to
the
skull
only
running
across
the
crown
of
it
was
a
stiff
raised
ridge
of
leather
perhaps
jagged
and
pointed
something
like
the
comb
of
a
cock
this
comb
of
brilliant
red
was
surmounted
at
its
highest
point
by
a
ball
of
black
of
the
size
of
a
small
apple
the
cap
itself
was
yellow
except
its
lowest
band
which
stood
out
from
it
and
was
also
black
in
the
centre
of
this
band
upon
the
forehead
glowed
a
stone
like
a
ruby
such
was
the
the
broad
shoulders
beneath
were
covered
with
a
cape
of
long
and
glossy
fur
blacker
than
coal
on
to
either
shoulder
of
which
drooped
made
of
rings
of
green
stone
which
afterward
hugh
came
to
know
was
jade
the
cape
of
fur
which
hung
down
to
the
knees
and
was
set
over
a
kind
of
surplice
of
yellow
silk
was
open
in
front
revealing
its
wearer
s
naked
bosom
that
was
clothed
only
with
row
upon
row
of
round
gems
of
the
size
of
a
hazel
nut
these
like
the
fur
were
black
but
shone
with
a
strange
and
lustrous
sheen
the
man
s
thick
arms
were
naked
but
on
his
hands
he
wore
white
leather
gloves
made
without
division
like
a
sock
as
though
to
match
the
white
sandals
on
his
feet
this
was
the
man
s
attire
now
for
him
who
wore
it
he
was
tall
but
not
taller
than
are
many
other
men
he
was
broad
but
not
broader
than
many
other
men
and
yet
he
looked
stronger
than
all
the
men
in
the
world
on
his
brow
which
was
prominent
smooth
black
hair
parted
in
the
middle
was
plastered
back
as
that
of
women
sometimes
is
making
hard
lines
against
the
yellow
skin
below
he
had
very
thin
eyebrows
that
ran
upward
on
either
side
of
a
wrinkle
in
the
centre
of
his
forehead
the
eyes
beneath
were
small
and
pale
paler
even
than
those
of
grey
dick
yet
their
glance
was
like
the
points
of
thrusting
swords
with
those
little
eyes
alone
he
seemed
to
smile
for
the
rest
of
his
countenance
did
not
move
the
nose
was
long
and
broad
at
the
end
with
wide
spreading
nostrils
and
a
deep
furrow
on
either
side
the
mouth
was
and
turned
downward
at
the
corners
and
the
chin
was
like
a
piece
of
iron
quite
hairless
and
lean
as
that
of
a
man
long
dead
there
he
stood
like
some
wild
vision
of
a
dream
smiling
with
those
small
unblinking
eyes
that
seemed
to
take
in
all
present
one
by
one
there
he
stood
in
the
moonlit
silence
for
the
mob
was
quiet
enough
now
for
a
little
while
that
yet
was
not
silence
because
of
a
soughing
noise
which
seemed
to
proceed
from
the
air
about
his
head
then
suddenly
the
tumult
broke
out
again
with
its
cries
of
kill
the
devil
tear
the
wizard
to
pieces
death
is
behind
him
he
brings
death
kill
kill
kill
a
score
of
knives
flashed
in
the
air
only
this
time
grey
dick
set
no
arrow
on
his
string
their
holders
ran
forward
then
the
man
lifted
his
hand
in
which
was
no
weapon
and
they
stopped
now
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
so
cold
that
to
hugh
s
excited
fancy
the
words
seemed
to
tinkle
like
falling
ice
as
one
by
one
they
came
from
his
lips
he
spoke
in
italian
perfect
italian
of
venice
and
young
day
whose
teeth
where
chattering
with
fear
translated
his
words
is
this
your
welcome
to
a
stranger
he
said
the
companions
of
whose
voyage
have
unhappily
met
with
misfortune
here
with
a
faint
motion
of
his
fingerless
glove
he
indicated
the
dead
who
lay
all
about
the
decks
of
that
fatal
ship
would
you
men
of
venice
kill
a
poor
unarmed
stranger
who
has
travelled
to
visit
you
from
the
farthest
east
and
seen
much
sorrow
on
his
way
ay
we
would
sorcerer
shouted
one
our
brothers
were
in
that
ship
which
we
know
and
you
have
murdered
how
did
you
learn
italian
in
the
farthest
east
asked
another
then
for
the
second
time
like
hounds
closing
in
on
a
stag
at
bay
they
sprang
toward
him
with
their
poised
knives
again
he
lifted
his
hand
again
the
halted
as
though
it
must
and
again
he
spoke
are
there
none
here
who
will
befriend
a
stranger
in
a
strange
land
none
who
are
ashamed
to
see
a
poor
unarmed
stranger
from
the
east
done
to
death
by
these
wolves
who
call
themselves
children
of
the
white
christ
of
mercy
now
hugh
touched
dick
upon
the
shoulder
rise
and
come
he
said
it
is
our
fate
and
dick
obeyed
only
after
he
had
translated
the
man
s
words
david
fell
down
flat
upon
the
quay
and
lay
there
they
stepped
to
the
man
and
stood
on
each
side
of
him
hugh
drawing
his
sword
and
dick
the
that
he
carried
beneath
his
robe
of
silk
we
will
said
hugh
shortly
in
english
now
there
are
three
of
us
went
on
the
man
the
stranger
from
the
east
has
found
defenders
from
the
west
on
defenders
for
i
do
not
fight
thus
and
he
folded
his
arms
across
his
broad
breast
and
smiled
with
the
awful
eyes
hugh
and
dick
knew
no
italian
yet
they
both
of
them
understood
and
with
a
shout
leaped
forward
toward
those
hungry
knives
but
their
holders
never
waited
for
them
some
sudden
panic
seized
them
all
so
that
they
turned
and
ran
ran
straight
across
the
wide
place
of
arms
and
vanished
into
the
network
of
narrow
streets
by
which
it
was
surrounded
chapter
xiii
murgh
s
arrow
hugh
and
dick
came
back
something
seemed
to
call
them
back
although
no
blow
had
been
struck
the
man
stood
where
they
had
left
him
staring
at
nothing
in
particular
apparently
he
was
engaged
in
meditation
thanking
his
gods
because
they
have
saved
him
from
sudden
death
muttered
grey
dick
if
he
s
got
any
gods
he
added
doubtfully
now
the
three
or
rather
the
four
of
them
for
david
day
had
recovered
and
once
more
stood
upon
his
feet
from
time
to
time
glancing
at
the
stranger
s
costume
with
a
frightened
eye
were
left
alone
upon
the
great
place
with
no
company
save
the
shipful
of
dead
behind
them
and
the
wild
white
moon
above
the
silence
that
save
for
the
soughing
sound
for
which
they
could
not
account
was
intense
oppressed
them
as
also
did
the
heat
grey
dick
coughed
but
the
man
took
no
notice
then
he
dropped
his
axe
with
a
clatter
on
the
marble
flooring
of
the
quay
and
picked
it
up
again
but
still
the
man
took
no
notice
evidently
his
eastern
imperturbability
was
not
to
be
disturbed
by
such
trifles
what
was
worse
or
so
thought
dick
his
master
hugh
had
fallen
into
a
very
similar
mood
he
stood
there
staring
at
the
man
while
the
man
stared
over
or
through
him
at
nothing
in
particular
grey
dick
felt
aggrieved
an
arrow
had
burst
to
pieces
unaccountably
in
his
bow
numbing
his
arm
and
wounding
him
on
the
chin
and
now
he
was
outpaced
at
his
own
game
of
cold
silence
he
grew
angry
and
dug
david
in
the
ribs
with
his
elbow
tell
that
foreigner
he
said
that
my
master
and
i
have
saved
his
life
those
italian
have
run
away
and
if
he
is
a
gentleman
he
should
say
thank
david
hesitated
whereon
dick
gave
him
another
dig
harder
than
the
first
and
asked
if
he
heard
what
he
said
then
david
obeyed
addressing
the
man
as
most
illustrious
as
though
he
were
the
doge
and
ending
his
speech
with
a
humble
apology
in
case
he
should
have
interrupted
his
pious
thanksgiving
the
man
seemed
to
awake
taking
no
notice
of
day
he
addressed
himself
to
dick
speaking
in
english
and
using
just
that
dialect
of
it
to
which
he
dick
had
been
accustomed
from
his
childhood
in
the
neighbourhood
of
dunwich
not
even
the
familiar
suffolk
whine
was
forgotten
you
and
your
master
have
saved
my
life
have
you
he
said
well
neighbour
why
did
you
try
to
save
my
life
by
shooting
at
me
with
that
great
black
bow
of
yours
which
i
see
is
made
of
eastern
woods
he
stared
at
the
case
in
which
it
was
now
again
hidden
as
though
tanned
leather
were
no
obstacle
to
his
sight
then
went
on
do
not
answer
i
will
tell
you
why
you
shot
at
me
because
you
were
afraid
of
me
and
fear
is
ever
cruel
is
it
not
only
something
happened
to
your
arrow
something
that
has
never
happened
to
any
arrow
of
yours
before
oh
yes
you
have
saved
me
from
the
italian
and
being
a
gentleman
i
thank
you
very
much
only
why
did
the
arrow
burst
in
your
bow
and
he
smiled
with
those
dreadful
eyes
of
his
now
feeling
overwhelmed
for
the
second
time
that
night
grey
dick
sat
himself
down
upon
a
quay
post
it
was
clear
to
him
that
to
argue
with
this
person
in
a
yellow
cap
who
talked
suffolk
so
well
was
quite
useless
why
then
waste
breath
which
was
probably
his
last
everybody
seemed
to
be
falling
into
meditation
again
when
the
man
shifting
his
head
slowly
began
to
consider
hugh
what
is
your
name
and
which
is
your
country
o
my
second
saviour
he
asked
still
speaking
in
english
only
now
the
english
was
of
a
different
and
more
refined
sort
to
that
which
he
had
used
when
he
addressed
dick
such
english
for
instance
as
came
from
the
lips
of
sir
geoffrey
carleon
or
from
those
of
the
lords
of
edward
s
court
i
am
sir
hugh
de
cressi
of
dunwich
in
the
county
of
suffolk
in
england
answered
hugh
slowly
england
i
have
heard
of
england
and
dunwich
i
have
heard
of
dunwich
indeed
i
travel
thither
having
an
appointment
with
an
old
friend
in
that
now
a
light
came
into
hugh
s
bewildered
face
but
he
said
nothing
i
seem
to
have
touched
some
chord
of
recollection
in
your
mind
o
my
saviour
of
dunwich
said
the
man
look
at
me
and
tell
me
who
am
i
hugh
looked
and
shook
his
head
i
never
saw
you
before
nor
any
one
at
all
like
you
he
answered
no
no
you
never
saw
me
though
i
have
been
very
near
to
you
once
or
twice
yet
your
pardon
look
hugh
obeyed
and
this
time
for
a
second
only
perceived
that
the
man
s
head
was
surrounded
by
a
multitude
of
doves
two
endless
lines
of
doves
one
line
black
and
the
other
line
white
stretched
from
his
right
shoulder
and
from
his
left
shoulder
till
miles
away
they
melted
into
the
lofty
gloom
of
the
sky
that
was
full
of
the
soughing
sound
of
their
wings
now
he
knew
and
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
fell
upon
his
knees
to
a
man
or
to
what
bore
the
semblance
of
man
you
are
named
murgh
gate
of
the
gods
he
said
murgh
whom
old
sir
andrew
saw
in
that
courtyard
over
which
the
iron
dragons
watch
in
the
country
called
cathay
that
courtyard
with
the
pool
of
water
and
the
many
ay
answered
the
man
in
a
new
voice
a
great
voice
that
seemed
to
fill
the
air
like
the
mutter
of
distant
thunder
i
am
murgh
gateway
of
the
gods
and
since
you
have
striven
to
defend
murgh
he
who
is
the
friend
of
all
men
although
they
know
it
not
will
above
all
be
your
friend
and
the
friend
of
those
you
he
stretched
out
his
long
arms
and
laid
his
hands
for
an
instant
one
of
them
upon
hugh
s
head
and
one
on
the
shoulder
of
grey
dick
who
sat
upon
the
pillar
of
stone
hugh
muttered
i
thank
you
not
knowing
what
else
to
say
but
in
his
heart
he
wondered
what
kind
of
friendship
this
mighty
and
awful
being
would
show
to
him
and
his
perhaps
he
might
hold
that
the
truest
kindness
would
be
to
remove
him
and
them
from
the
miseries
of
a
sinful
world
if
murgh
read
his
thoughts
he
only
answered
them
with
that
smile
of
his
cold
eyes
which
was
more
awful
than
the
frown
of
any
mortal
man
turning
his
head
slowly
he
began
to
contemplate
dick
sitting
on
his
stone
if
i
had
a
son
he
said
by
that
face
of
yours
you
might
be
perchance
answered
dick
since
i
never
knew
for
certain
who
my
father
was
only
i
have
always
heard
that
life
begets
not
death
you
honour
me
with
a
great
name
well
life
and
death
are
one
and
you
and
i
are
one
with
the
moon
and
the
stars
above
us
and
many
other
things
and
beings
that
you
can
not
see
therefore
the
begetter
and
the
begotten
are
one
in
the
hand
that
holds
them
ay
answered
dick
and
so
my
bow
and
i
are
one
i
ve
often
thought
it
only
you
nearly
made
me
one
with
my
own
arrow
which
is
closer
kinship
than
i
seek
and
he
touched
the
cut
upon
his
chin
since
you
are
so
wise
my
father
or
my
son
tell
me
what
is
this
hand
that
holds
them
all
gladly
only
if
i
do
first
i
must
ask
you
to
die
then
say
in
a
minute
or
two
you
shall
dick
peered
at
him
doubtfully
and
said
if
that
be
so
i
think
i
ll
wait
for
the
answer
which
i
am
sure
to
learn
soon
or
ah
many
men
have
thought
the
same
and
you
have
sent
some
to
seek
it
have
you
not
being
so
good
an
archer
for
instance
that
was
a
long
shaft
you
shot
before
crecy
fray
at
the
filthy
fool
who
mocked
your
english
host
doubtless
now
he
knows
the
answer
to
your
who
told
you
of
that
asked
dick
springing
up
a
friend
of
mine
who
was
in
the
battle
he
said
also
that
your
name
was
richard
the
a
friend
i
believe
that
you
were
there
yourself
as
if
you
are
death
you
may
well
have
perhaps
you
are
right
richard
have
i
not
just
told
you
that
we
all
are
one
yes
even
the
slayer
and
the
slain
therefore
if
my
friend
did
you
call
him
death
was
there
i
was
there
if
you
were
there
i
was
there
and
it
was
my
hand
that
drew
yonder
great
black
bow
of
yours
and
my
eye
that
guided
the
straight
shaft
which
laid
the
foulmouthed
jester
low
why
did
you
not
say
as
much
yourself
when
your
master
here
bade
farewell
to
his
father
in
the
ship
at
calais
what
were
the
words
oh
i
remember
them
you
wondered
how
one
i
may
not
name
and
he
bowed
his
solemn
head
came
to
make
that
black
bow
and
yours
and
you
the
death
that
draw
now
at
length
grey
dick
s
courage
gave
out
of
no
man
upon
earth
am
i
afraid
he
said
but
from
you
o
god
or
devil
who
read
the
secret
hearts
of
men
and
hear
their
secret
words
my
blood
flows
backward
as
it
did
when
first
my
eyes
fell
on
you
you
would
kill
me
because
i
dared
to
shoot
at
you
well
kill
but
do
not
torture
it
is
unworthy
of
a
knight
even
if
he
took
his
accolade
in
hell
and
he
placed
his
hands
before
his
eyes
and
stood
before
him
with
bent
head
waiting
for
the
end
why
give
me
such
high
names
richard
the
fatherless
when
you
have
heard
two
humbler
ones
call
me
murgh
as
do
my
friends
or
call
me
the
gate
as
do
those
who
as
yet
know
me
less
well
but
talk
not
of
gods
or
devils
lest
suddenly
one
of
them
should
answer
you
nay
man
have
no
fear
those
who
seek
death
he
often
flees
as
i
think
he
flees
from
you
yet
let
us
see
if
we
can
not
send
a
longer
shaft
you
and
i
than
that
which
we
loosed
on
crecy
field
give
me
the
dick
although
he
had
never
suffered
living
man
to
shoot
with
it
before
handed
him
the
black
bow
and
with
it
a
war
shaft
which
he
drew
from
his
quiver
tell
me
archer
dick
have
you
any
enemy
in
this
town
of
venice
because
if
so
we
might
try
a
shot
at
one
or
two
gate
murgh
answered
dick
still
whatever
your
half
of
me
may
do
my
bit
of
you
does
not
love
to
strike
down
men
by
magic
in
the
well
said
and
better
thought
then
bethink
you
of
something
that
belongs
to
an
enemy
which
will
serve
as
well
for
a
test
of
shooting
ah
i
thank
you
well
thought
again
yes
i
see
the
mark
though
tis
far
is
it
not
now
set
your
mind
on
it
but
stay
first
will
you
know
this
arrow
again
surely
answered
dick
i
made
it
myself
moreover
though
two
of
the
feathers
are
black
the
third
is
white
with
four
black
spots
and
a
little
splash
of
brown
look
on
it
sir
hugh
it
can
not
be
hugh
looked
and
nodded
speak
he
could
not
for
the
life
of
him
then
murgh
began
to
play
a
little
with
the
bow
and
oh
strange
and
dreadful
was
the
music
that
came
from
its
string
beneath
the
touch
of
his
gloved
fingers
it
sang
like
a
harp
and
wailed
like
a
woman
so
fearfully
indeed
that
the
lad
day
who
all
this
while
stood
by
aghast
stopped
his
ears
with
his
fingers
and
hugh
groaned
then
this
awful
archer
swiftly
set
the
arrow
on
the
string
now
think
with
your
mind
and
shoot
with
your
heart
he
said
in
his
cold
voice
and
so
saying
drew
and
loosed
as
though
at
a
hazard
out
toward
venice
leaped
the
shaft
with
a
rushing
sound
like
to
that
of
wings
and
as
it
seemed
to
the
watchers
light
went
with
it
for
it
travelled
like
a
beam
of
light
far
over
the
city
it
travelled
describing
a
mighty
arc
such
as
no
arrow
ever
flew
before
then
sank
down
and
vanished
behind
some
palace
tower
a
very
good
bow
said
the
shooter
as
he
handed
it
back
to
dick
never
have
i
used
a
better
who
have
used
thousands
made
of
many
a
substance
indeed
i
think
that
i
remember
it
did
you
chance
to
find
it
years
ago
by
the
seashore
yes
well
it
was
a
gift
of
mine
to
a
famous
archer
who
died
upon
a
ship
nay
it
is
not
strained
i
can
judge
of
the
breaking
strength
of
a
bow
whether
or
no
i
can
judge
of
the
flight
of
an
arrow
you
will
learn
hereafter
but
that
this
one
flew
fast
and
far
can
not
be
doubted
since
did
you
watchers
note
it
its
speed
made
it
shine
like
fire
this
is
caused
by
the
rubbing
of
the
air
when
aught
travels
through
it
very
quickly
this
night
you
have
seen
a
meteor
glow
in
the
same
fashion
only
because
the
air
fretted
it
in
its
passage
in
the
east
whence
i
come
we
produce
fire
just
so
and
now
let
us
be
going
for
i
have
much
to
do
and
would
look
upon
this
fair
venice
ere
i
sleep
i
ll
lead
the
way
having
seen
a
map
of
the
town
which
a
traveller
brought
to
the
east
i
studied
it
and
now
it
comes
back
to
my
mind
stay
let
that
youth
give
me
his
garment
and
he
pointed
to
david
day
who
wore
a
silk
cloak
like
the
others
since
my
foreign
dress
might
excite
remark
as
it
did
but
in
a
moment
day
had
stripped
himself
of
his
light
gown
and
in
another
moment
it
was
on
the
person
of
murgh
though
how
it
got
there
when
they
came
to
think
of
it
afterward
none
could
remember
still
the
yellow
and
red
the
silky
furs
the
yellow
skirt
the
gleaming
pearls
all
vanished
beneath
it
nothing
remained
visible
except
the
white
fingerless
gloves
why
were
they
fingerless
and
what
lay
beneath
them
hugh
wondered
and
the
white
shoes
forward
they
went
across
the
place
of
arms
past
the
timber
stand
ornamented
with
banners
which
murgh
stayed
to
contemplate
for
an
instant
until
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
the
street
up
which
men
had
followed
them
apparently
with
evil
intent
sir
murgh
said
hugh
stepping
forward
you
had
best
let
me
and
my
companion
grey
dick
walk
first
down
this
place
lest
you
should
come
to
harm
when
we
passed
it
a
while
ago
we
thought
that
we
heard
robbers
behind
us
and
in
venice
as
we
are
told
such
men
use
thank
you
for
your
warning
sir
hugh
and
even
beneath
the
shadow
of
the
silk
hood
hugh
thought
that
he
saw
his
eyes
smile
and
seeing
remembered
all
the
folly
of
such
talk
yet
i
ll
risk
these
robbers
do
you
two
and
the
lad
keep
behind
me
he
added
in
a
sterner
voice
so
they
advanced
down
the
narrow
street
the
man
called
murgh
going
first
hugh
grey
dick
and
the
lad
following
meekly
behind
him
as
they
entered
its
shadows
a
low
whistle
sounded
but
nothing
happened
for
a
while
when
they
had
traversed
about
half
its
length
however
men
five
or
six
of
them
in
all
darted
out
of
the
gloom
of
a
gateway
and
rushed
at
them
the
faint
light
showed
that
they
were
masked
and
gleamed
upon
the
blue
steel
of
the
daggers
in
their
hands
two
of
these
men
struck
at
murgh
with
their
knives
while
the
others
tried
to
pass
him
doubtless
to
attack
his
companions
but
failed
why
they
failed
hugh
and
dick
never
knew
all
they
saw
was
that
murgh
stretched
out
his
hands
and
they
fell
back
the
men
who
had
struck
at
him
fell
back
also
their
daggers
dropping
to
the
ground
and
fled
away
followed
by
their
companions
all
except
one
whom
murgh
had
seized
hugh
noted
that
he
was
a
tall
thin
fellow
and
that
unlike
the
rest
he
had
drawn
no
weapon
although
it
was
at
his
signal
that
the
other
bravoes
had
rushed
on
this
man
murgh
seemed
to
hold
with
one
hand
while
with
the
other
he
ripped
the
mask
off
his
face
turning
him
so
that
the
light
shone
on
him
hugh
and
dick
saw
the
face
and
knew
it
for
that
of
the
priest
who
had
accompanied
acour
to
england
it
was
he
who
had
drugged
red
eve
and
read
the
mass
of
marriage
over
her
while
she
was
drugged
who
are
you
asked
murgh
in
his
light
cold
voice
by
your
shaven
head
a
priest
i
think
one
who
serves
some
god
of
love
and
mercy
and
yet
you
come
upon
this
ill
errand
as
a
captain
of
assassins
why
do
you
seek
to
do
murder
o
priest
of
the
god
of
mercy
now
some
power
seemed
to
drag
the
answer
from
father
nicholas
because
i
must
he
said
i
have
sold
myself
and
must
pay
the
price
step
leads
to
step
and
he
who
runs
may
not
stop
upon
no
priest
nicholas
since
ever
they
grow
more
narrow
and
more
steep
yet
at
the
foot
of
them
is
the
dark
abyss
and
murderer
nicholas
you
have
reached
the
last
of
all
your
steps
look
at
me
and
with
one
hand
he
threw
back
the
hood
next
instant
they
saw
nicholas
rush
staggering
down
the
street
screaming
with
terror
as
he
went
then
as
all
the
bravoes
had
gone
they
continued
their
march
filled
with
reflections
till
they
came
to
the
little
where
they
had
left
the
boat
it
was
still
there
though
the
boatman
had
gone
let
us
borrow
this
boat
said
murgh
as
from
my
study
of
the
map
i
know
these
i
will
be
steersman
and
that
lad
shall
row
and
tell
me
if
i
go
wrong
first
i
will
take
you
to
the
house
where
i
think
you
said
you
lodged
and
thence
to
go
seek
friends
of
my
own
in
this
city
who
will
show
me
they
glided
on
down
the
long
canals
in
utter
silence
that
was
broken
only
by
the
soft
dipping
of
the
oars
the
night
was
somewhat
cooler
now
for
the
bursting
of
the
great
meteor
seemed
to
have
cleared
the
air
or
perhaps
the
gentle
breeze
that
had
sprung
up
blowing
from
the
open
sea
tempered
its
stifling
heat
so
it
came
about
that
although
it
grew
late
many
people
were
gathered
on
the
or
on
the
balconies
of
the
fine
houses
which
they
passed
for
the
most
part
doubtless
discussing
the
travelling
star
that
had
been
seen
in
the
sky
or
perhaps
they
had
already
heard
rumours
of
the
strange
visitor
who
had
come
to
venice
although
however
fast
such
news
may
fly
this
seemed
scarcely
probable
at
the
least
there
they
were
men
and
women
talking
earnestly
together
and
about
them
the
three
englishmen
noted
a
strange
thing
as
their
boat
slipped
by
some
influence
seemed
to
pass
from
it
to
the
minds
of
all
these
people
their
talk
died
out
and
was
succeeded
by
a
morne
and
heavy
silence
they
looked
at
it
as
though
wondering
why
a
sight
so
usual
should
draw
their
eyes
then
after
a
few
irresolute
moments
the
groups
on
the
footpaths
separated
and
went
their
ways
without
bidding
each
other
good
night
as
they
went
many
of
them
made
the
sign
with
their
fingers
that
these
italians
believed
could
avert
evil
which
gave
them
the
appearance
of
all
pointing
at
the
boat
or
its
occupants
those
in
the
balconies
did
the
same
thing
and
disappeared
through
the
open
more
than
any
of
the
wonderful
things
that
he
had
done
perhaps
this
effect
of
the
eastern
stranger
s
presence
struck
terror
and
foreboding
to
hugh
s
heart
at
length
they
came
to
the
end
of
that
little
street
where
they
had
hired
the
boat
for
although
none
had
told
him
the
way
thither
their
dread
steersman
brought
them
without
fault
the
lad
david
laid
down
his
oars
and
mounted
the
steps
that
led
to
the
street
which
was
quite
deserted
even
the
bordering
houses
being
in
darkness
hugh
de
cressi
and
richard
the
fatherless
said
murgh
you
have
seen
wonderful
things
this
night
and
made
a
strange
friend
as
you
may
think
by
chance
although
truly
in
all
the
wide
universe
there
is
no
room
for
such
a
thing
as
chance
now
my
counsel
to
you
and
your
companion
is
that
you
speak
no
word
of
these
matters
lest
you
should
be
set
upon
as
wizards
we
part
but
we
shall
meet
again
twice
more
and
after
many
years
a
third
time
but
that
third
meeting
do
not
seek
for
it
will
be
when
the
last
grains
of
sand
are
running
from
the
glass
also
you
may
see
me
at
other
times
but
if
so
unless
i
speak
to
you
do
not
speak
to
me
now
go
your
ways
fearing
nothing
however
great
may
seem
your
peril
i
say
to
you
fear
nothing
soon
you
will
hear
ill
things
spoken
of
me
yet
and
here
a
touch
of
human
wistfulness
came
into
his
inhuman
voice
i
pray
you
believe
them
not
when
i
am
named
murgh
the
fiend
and
murgh
the
sword
then
think
of
me
as
murgh
the
helper
what
i
do
is
decreed
by
that
which
is
greater
than
i
and
if
you
could
understand
it
leads
by
terrible
ways
to
a
goal
of
good
as
all
things
do
richard
the
archer
i
will
answer
the
riddle
that
you
asked
yourself
upon
the
ship
at
calais
the
strength
which
made
your
black
bow
an
instrument
of
doom
made
you
who
loose
its
shafts
and
me
who
can
outshoot
you
far
as
the
arrow
travels
whither
it
is
sent
and
there
does
its
appointed
work
so
do
you
travel
and
so
do
i
and
many
another
thing
seen
and
unseen
and
therefore
i
told
you
truly
that
although
we
differ
in
degree
yet
we
are
one
yes
even
murgh
the
eating
fire
murgh
the
gate
and
that
bent
wand
of
yours
are
one
in
the
hand
that
shaped
and
holds
us
then
divesting
himself
of
the
long
robe
which
he
had
borrowed
from
the
lad
he
handed
it
to
hugh
and
taking
the
oars
rowed
away
clad
in
his
rich
fantastic
garb
which
now
as
at
first
could
be
seen
by
all
he
rowed
away
and
for
a
while
the
three
whom
he
had
left
behind
heard
the
soughing
of
the
innumerable
wings
that
went
ever
with
him
after
which
came
silence
silence
but
not
for
long
for
presently
from
the
borders
of
the
great
canal
into
which
his
skiff
must
enter
rose
shouts
of
fear
and
rage
near
by
at
first
then
farther
and
farther
off
till
these
too
were
lost
in
silence
oh
sir
hugh
sobbed
poor
david
day
who
and
what
is
that
dreadful
man
i
think
his
name
is
death
answered
hugh
solemnly
while
dick
nodded
his
head
but
said
nothing
then
we
must
die
went
on
david
in
his
terror
and
i
am
not
fit
to
i
think
not
said
hugh
again
be
comforted
death
has
passed
us
by
only
be
warned
also
and
as
he
bade
you
say
nothing
of
all
that
you
have
heard
and
by
death
himself
i
ll
say
nothing
for
my
life
s
sake
he
replied
faintly
for
he
was
shaking
in
every
limb
then
they
walked
up
the
street
to
the
yard
door
as
they
went
hugh
asked
dick
what
it
was
that
he
had
in
his
mind
as
a
mark
for
the
arrow
that
murgh
had
shot
that
arrow
which
to
his
charmed
sight
had
seemed
to
rush
over
venice
like
a
flake
of
fire
i
ll
not
tell
you
master
answered
dick
lest
you
should
think
me
madder
than
i
am
which
would
be
very
mad
indeed
stay
though
i
ll
tell
david
here
that
he
may
be
a
witness
to
my
folly
and
he
called
the
young
man
to
him
and
spoke
with
him
apart
then
they
unlocked
the
courtyard
gate
and
entered
the
house
by
the
kitchen
door
as
it
chanced
quite
unobserved
for
now
all
the
servants
were
abed
indeed
of
that
household
none
ever
knew
that
they
had
been
outside
its
walls
this
night
since
no
one
saw
them
go
or
return
and
sir
geoffrey
and
his
lady
thought
that
they
had
retired
to
their
chamber
they
came
to
the
door
of
their
room
david
still
with
them
for
the
place
where
he
slept
was
at
the
end
of
this
same
passage
bide
here
a
while
said
dick
to
him
my
master
and
i
may
have
a
word
to
say
to
you
then
they
lit
tapers
from
a
little
roman
lamp
that
burned
all
night
in
the
passage
and
entered
the
room
dick
walked
at
once
to
the
looked
and
laughed
a
little
the
arrow
has
missed
he
said
or
rather
he
added
doubtfully
the
target
is
what
target
asked
hugh
wearily
for
now
he
desired
sleep
more
than
he
had
ever
done
in
all
his
life
then
he
turned
the
taper
in
his
hand
and
started
back
suddenly
pointing
to
something
which
hung
upon
his
that
stood
opposite
to
the
window
who
nails
his
helm
upon
my
bed
he
said
is
this
a
challenge
from
some
knight
of
venice
dick
stepped
forward
and
looked
an
omen
not
a
challenge
i
think
come
and
see
for
yourself
he
said
this
is
what
hugh
saw
fixed
to
the
post
by
a
shaft
which
pierced
it
and
the
carved
olivewood
from
side
to
side
was
the
helm
that
they
had
stripped
from
the
body
of
sir
pierre
de
la
roche
the
helm
of
sir
edmund
acour
which
sir
pierre
had
worn
at
crecy
and
dick
had
tumbled
out
of
his
sack
in
the
presence
of
the
doge
before
cattrina
s
face
on
his
return
to
the
house
of
sir
geoffrey
carleon
he
had
set
it
down
in
the
centre
of
the
open
and
left
it
there
when
they
went
out
to
survey
the
ground
where
they
must
fight
upon
the
morrow
having
studied
it
for
a
moment
dick
went
to
the
door
and
called
to
david
friend
he
said
standing
between
him
and
the
bed
so
that
he
could
see
nothing
what
was
it
that
just
now
i
told
you
was
in
my
mind
when
yonder
murgh
asked
me
at
what
target
he
should
shoot
with
my
bow
on
the
place
of
arms
a
knight
s
helm
answered
david
which
stood
in
the
window
of
your
room
at
the
ambassador
s
house
a
knight
s
helmet
that
had
a
swan
for
its
you
hear
said
dick
to
hugh
now
come
both
of
you
and
see
what
is
that
which
hangs
upon
the
answer
you
david
for
perchance
my
sight
is
a
knight
s
helm
answered
david
bearing
the
crest
of
a
floating
swan
and
held
there
by
an
arrow
which
has
pierced
it
what
was
the
arrow
like
which
i
gave
this
night
to
one
murgh
master
asked
dick
again
it
was
a
war
shaft
having
two
black
feathers
and
the
third
white
but
chequered
with
four
black
spots
and
a
smear
of
brown
answered
hugh
then
is
that
the
same
arrow
master
which
this
murgh
loosed
from
more
than
a
mile
away
hugh
examined
it
with
care
thrice
he
examined
it
point
and
shaft
and
feathers
then
in
a
low
voice
he
answered
chapter
xiv
at
the
place
of
arms
notwithstanding
all
that
has
been
told
hugh
and
dick
never
slept
more
soundly
than
they
did
that
night
nor
was
their
rest
broken
by
any
dreams
at
half
past
five
in
the
morning
for
they
must
be
stirring
early
david
came
to
call
them
he
too
it
seemed
had
slept
well
also
in
the
light
of
day
the
worst
of
his
fear
had
left
him
i
am
wondering
sir
hugh
he
said
looking
at
him
curiously
whether
i
saw
certain
things
last
night
down
yonder
at
the
place
of
arms
and
in
the
boat
or
whether
i
thought
i
saw
doubtless
you
thought
you
saw
them
david
answered
hugh
adding
with
meaning
and
it
is
not
always
well
to
talk
of
things
we
think
that
we
have
the
lad
who
was
sharp
enough
nodded
but
as
he
turned
to
hand
hugh
some
garment
his
eye
fell
upon
the
helm
that
was
still
nailed
by
the
long
with
two
black
feathers
and
one
white
to
the
carved
olivewood
post
of
the
bed
it
must
have
been
a
mighty
arm
that
shot
this
arrow
sir
hugh
he
said
reflectively
which
could
pierce
a
casque
of
milan
steel
from
side
to
side
and
a
hardwood
post
beyond
well
for
the
owner
of
the
helm
that
his
head
was
not
inside
of
very
well
and
a
very
mighty
arm
david
so
mighty
that
i
should
say
nothing
about
it
for
fear
lest
it
should
set
another
arrow
upon
another
string
and
shoot
god
s
truth
not
i
exclaimed
david
and
for
your
comfort
sir
know
that
none
saw
us
leave
this
house
or
reënter
it
last
then
hugh
and
dick
clothed
themselves
and
saw
to
their
weapons
and
mail
but
this
they
did
not
don
as
yet
fearing
lest
the
weight
of
it
should
weary
them
in
that
great
heat
although
the
day
was
so
young
this
heat
was
terrible
more
oppressive
indeed
than
any
they
had
yet
known
in
venice
when
they
were
ready
david
left
them
to
see
to
the
horse
which
de
cressi
would
ride
in
his
combat
with
cattrina
hugh
as
became
a
knight
whom
sir
andrew
arnold
had
instructed
from
childhood
crossed
himself
knelt
down
and
said
his
prayers
which
that
morning
were
long
and
earnest
indeed
he
would
have
confessed
himself
also
if
he
could
only
there
was
no
priest
at
hand
who
knew
his
language
sir
geoffrey
s
chaplain
being
away
after
watching
him
a
while
even
grey
dick
whose
prayers
were
few
followed
his
example
kneeling
in
front
of
his
bow
as
though
it
were
an
image
that
he
worshipped
when
they
had
risen
again
he
said
you
grieve
that
there
is
none
to
shrive
us
master
but
i
hold
otherwise
since
when
it
was
told
what
company
we
kept
last
night
absolution
might
be
lacking
this
would
weigh
on
you
if
not
on
me
who
after
what
i
have
learned
of
father
nicholas
and
others
love
but
one
priest
and
he
far
yet
it
is
well
to
have
the
blessings
of
holy
church
ere
such
a
business
as
ours
dick
that
is
if
it
can
be
come
mayhap
master
but
for
my
part
i
am
content
with
that
of
murgh
which
he
gave
us
you
may
remember
or
so
i
understood
him
moreover
did
he
not
teach
that
he
and
all
are
but
ministers
of
him
above
therefore
i
go
straight
to
the
head
of
the
stair
and
he
nodded
toward
the
sky
i
am
content
to
skip
all
those
steps
which
are
called
priests
and
altars
and
popes
and
saints
and
folk
living
or
dead
if
murgh
s
wisdom
be
true
as
i
think
these
are
but
garnishings
to
the
dish
which
can
well
be
spared
by
the
hungry
that
may
be
hugh
answered
dubiously
for
his
faith
in
such
matters
was
that
of
his
time
yet
were
i
you
dick
i
d
not
preach
that
philosophy
too
loud
lest
the
priests
and
popes
should
have
something
to
say
to
it
the
saints
also
for
aught
i
know
since
i
have
always
heard
that
they
love
not
to
be
left
out
of
our
account
with
well
if
so
answered
dick
i
ll
quote
murgh
to
them
who
is
a
very
fitting
patron
for
an
then
once
again
he
glanced
at
the
helm
and
the
arrow
with
something
not
unlike
fear
in
his
cold
eye
presently
they
went
down
to
the
eating
chamber
where
they
had
been
told
that
breakfast
would
be
ready
for
them
at
seven
of
the
clock
there
they
found
sir
geoffrey
awaiting
them
i
trust
that
you
have
slept
well
sir
hugh
he
said
you
were
a
wise
knight
to
go
to
rest
so
early
having
before
you
such
a
trial
of
your
strength
and
manhood
and
so
to
speak
the
honour
of
our
king
upon
your
very
well
indeed
thank
you
sir
answered
hugh
and
you
oh
ill
extremely
ill
i
do
not
know
what
is
the
matter
with
me
or
venice
either
whereof
the
very
air
seems
poisoned
feel
the
heat
and
see
the
haze
it
is
most
unnatural
moreover
although
in
your
bed
doubtless
you
saw
it
not
a
great
ball
of
fire
blazed
and
burnt
over
the
city
last
night
so
bright
was
it
that
even
in
a
darkened
room
each
of
us
could
see
the
colour
of
the
other
s
eyes
later
too
as
i
watched
at
the
window
there
came
a
thin
streak
of
flame
that
seemed
to
alight
on
or
about
this
very
house
indeed
i
thought
i
heard
a
sound
as
of
iron
striking
upon
iron
but
could
find
no
cause
for
wondrous
happenings
sir
said
grey
dick
glad
am
i
that
we
were
not
with
you
lest
the
sight
of
them
should
have
made
us
fearful
on
this
morning
of
wondrous
happenings
indeed
friend
richard
said
sir
geoffrey
excitedly
but
you
have
not
heard
the
half
of
them
the
herald
who
has
just
been
here
with
the
final
articles
of
your
fray
signed
by
the
doge
and
cattrina
has
told
me
much
that
i
can
scarce
believe
he
says
that
the
great
galley
from
this
port
which
is
called
of
the
drifted
up
to
the
quay
at
the
place
of
arms
last
night
on
her
return
voyage
from
cyprus
filled
with
dead
and
with
no
living
thing
aboard
her
save
the
devil
himself
in
a
yellow
robe
and
a
like
a
cock
with
a
red
eye
he
swears
that
this
fiend
landed
and
that
the
mob
set
on
him
whereon
two
some
say
three
other
devils
clad
in
long
black
gowns
appeared
out
of
the
water
and
drove
them
back
also
it
seems
that
this
same
cock
satan
stole
a
boat
and
rowed
about
the
city
afterward
but
now
none
can
find
him
although
they
have
got
the
then
they
should
be
well
satisfied
said
hugh
since
its
owner
has
lost
nothing
but
the
hire
which
with
satan
at
the
oars
is
better
than
might
be
hoped
perhaps
he
was
not
there
after
all
sir
i
know
not
but
at
least
the
galley
of
the
is
there
for
ever
since
the
dawn
they
have
been
taking
the
dead
out
of
her
to
bury
them
of
these
they
say
things
too
terrible
to
repeat
for
no
doctor
can
tell
of
what
sickness
they
died
never
having
seen
its
like
for
my
part
i
pray
it
may
not
be
catching
were
i
the
doge
i
would
have
towed
her
out
to
sea
and
scuttled
her
cargo
and
all
well
well
enough
of
these
wild
tales
of
which
god
alone
knows
the
truth
come
eat
if
you
can
in
this
heat
we
must
be
on
the
place
of
arms
by
eight
you
and
the
captain
go
thither
in
my
own
boat
sir
hugh
your
horse
david
day
takes
on
presently
now
while
you
breakfast
i
ll
explain
to
you
these
articles
one
by
one
for
they
are
writ
in
italian
which
you
can
not
read
see
you
forget
them
not
these
venetians
are
punctilious
of
such
forms
and
ceremonies
especially
when
the
case
is
that
of
combat
to
the
death
which
is
rare
among
the
articles
which
were
lengthy
had
been
read
and
the
breakfast
or
so
much
as
they
could
eat
of
it
consumed
at
last
hugh
accompanied
by
a
venetian
squire
of
high
birth
sent
by
the
doge
to
bear
his
casque
and
other
armour
stood
in
the
vestibule
waiting
for
the
ambassador
s
barge
of
state
with
him
was
grey
dick
accompanied
by
no
one
and
carrying
the
mail
shirt
in
which
he
was
to
fight
like
a
housewife
s
parcel
beneath
his
arm
although
he
wore
bow
on
back
axe
and
dagger
at
side
and
iron
cap
upon
his
head
presently
while
they
lingered
thus
out
from
a
appeared
lady
carleon
clothed
in
a
white
garment
such
as
women
wear
when
their
dressing
is
half
done
down
which
her
grey
hair
hung
dishevelled
i
am
come
thus
unkempt
sir
hugh
she
said
for
not
feeling
well
i
could
not
rise
early
to
bid
you
since
i
am
sure
that
we
shall
not
meet
again
however
much
that
doge
may
press
it
i
can
not
go
down
yonder
to
see
my
countrymen
butchered
in
this
heat
oh
oh
and
she
pressed
her
hand
upon
her
heart
what
s
the
matter
madam
asked
hugh
anxiously
a
pain
in
my
breast
that
is
all
as
though
some
one
drove
a
dagger
through
me
there
there
tis
i
thank
you
for
your
goodness
lady
carleon
said
hugh
when
she
was
herself
again
then
paused
for
he
knew
not
what
to
add
not
so
sir
hugh
not
so
tis
for
your
sakes
in
truth
since
you
remember
you
never
told
me
what
you
would
wish
done
afterward
your
possessions
also
where
are
they
to
be
sent
doubtless
you
have
money
and
other
things
of
value
be
sure
that
they
shall
be
sealed
up
i
ll
see
to
it
myself
but
how
shall
i
dispose
of
them
madame
i
will
tell
you
when
i
return
said
hugh
shortly
nay
nay
sir
hugh
pray
do
not
return
those
who
are
gone
had
best
keep
gone
i
think
who
always
have
had
a
loathing
of
ghosts
therefore
i
beg
you
tell
me
now
but
do
not
come
back
shining
like
a
saint
and
gibbering
like
a
monkey
at
dead
of
night
because
if
you
do
i
am
sure
i
shall
not
understand
and
if
there
is
an
error
who
will
set
it
straight
hugh
leaned
against
a
marble
pillar
in
the
hall
and
looked
at
his
hostess
helplessly
while
sir
geoffrey
catching
her
drift
at
length
broke
in
cease
such
talk
wife
think
you
that
it
is
of
a
kind
to
give
brave
men
a
stomach
in
a
fight
to
the
end
i
know
not
geoffrey
but
surely
tis
better
to
have
these
matters
settled
for
as
you
often
say
death
is
always
near
ay
madam
broke
in
grey
dick
who
could
bear
no
more
of
it
death
is
always
near
to
all
of
us
and
especially
so
in
venice
just
now
therefore
i
pray
you
tell
me
in
case
we
should
live
and
should
die
you
and
all
about
you
whether
you
have
any
commands
to
give
as
to
what
should
be
done
with
your
gold
and
articles
of
value
or
any
messages
to
leave
for
friends
in
then
having
uttered
this
grim
jest
dick
took
his
master
by
the
arm
and
drew
him
through
the
door
afterward
for
a
reason
that
shall
be
told
he
was
sorry
that
it
had
ever
passed
his
lips
still
in
the
boat
sir
geoffrey
applauded
him
saying
that
his
lady
s
melancholy
had
grown
beyond
all
bearing
and
that
she
did
little
but
prate
to
him
about
his
will
and
what
colour
of
marble
he
desired
for
his
tomb
after
a
journey
that
seemed
long
to
hugh
who
wished
to
have
this
business
over
they
came
to
the
place
of
arms
their
route
there
however
was
not
the
same
which
they
had
followed
on
the
previous
night
leaving
the
short
way
through
the
low
part
of
the
town
untraversed
they
rowed
from
one
of
the
canals
into
the
harbour
itself
where
they
were
joined
by
many
other
boats
which
waited
for
them
and
so
on
to
the
quay
hugh
saw
at
once
that
the
death
ship
of
the
was
gone
and
incautiously
said
as
much
to
sir
geoffrey
yes
he
answered
one
of
my
rowers
tells
me
that
they
have
towed
her
to
an
island
out
at
sea
since
the
stench
from
her
holds
was
more
than
could
be
borne
but
how
did
you
know
that
she
lay
at
this
particular
quay
sir
hugh
i
thought
you
said
so
he
answered
carelessly
adding
to
change
the
subject
look
our
fray
will
not
lack
for
spectators
and
he
pointed
to
the
thousands
gathered
upon
the
great
no
no
all
venice
will
be
there
for
these
people
love
a
show
especially
if
there
be
death
in
mayhap
they
will
see
more
of
him
than
they
wish
before
all
is
done
muttered
grey
dick
pausing
from
the
task
of
whetting
his
axe
s
edge
with
a
little
stone
which
he
carried
in
his
pouch
then
he
replaced
the
axe
in
its
hanger
and
drawing
hugh
s
sword
from
its
sheath
began
to
give
some
final
touches
to
its
razor
edge
saying
father
sir
andrew
arnold
blessed
it
which
should
be
enough
but
milan
steel
is
hard
and
his
old
battle
blade
will
bite
none
the
worse
for
an
extra
sharpening
go
for
his
throat
master
go
for
his
throat
the
mail
is
always
thinnest
god
above
us
what
a
grim
man
exclaimed
sir
geoffrey
and
so
thought
all
in
that
boat
and
in
those
around
them
at
least
they
looked
at
dick
askance
as
he
whetted
and
whetted
and
then
plucking
out
one
of
the
pale
hairs
from
his
head
drew
it
along
the
edge
of
the
steel
which
severed
it
in
twain
there
that
ll
do
said
grey
dick
cheerfully
as
he
returned
the
long
sword
to
its
sheath
and
god
help
this
cattrina
i
say
for
he
comes
to
his
last
battle
that
is
unless
he
runs
away
he
added
after
reflection
now
they
landed
and
were
received
by
heralds
blowing
trumpets
and
conducted
through
a
great
multitude
of
people
with
much
pomp
and
ceremony
to
a
pavilion
which
had
been
pitched
for
them
where
they
must
arm
and
make
ready
this
then
they
did
helped
or
hindered
by
bowing
squires
whose
language
they
could
not
understand
at
length
when
it
lacked
but
a
quarter
to
the
hour
of
nine
david
day
led
hugh
s
horse
into
the
wide
entrance
of
the
pavilion
where
they
examined
its
armour
bridle
selle
and
trappings
the
beast
sweats
already
said
hugh
and
so
do
i
who
to
tell
truth
dread
this
heat
more
than
cattrina
s
sword
pray
that
they
get
to
the
business
quickly
or
i
shall
melt
like
butter
on
a
hot
then
his
lance
was
given
to
him
a
lance
that
was
sharp
and
strong
when
they
had
been
tested
by
them
both
hugh
mounted
the
grey
and
at
the
agreed
signal
of
a
single
blast
upon
a
trumpet
walked
it
slowly
from
the
pavilion
dick
going
at
his
side
on
foot
at
their
coming
a
shout
went
up
from
the
assembled
thousands
for
in
truth
it
seemed
as
sir
geoffrey
had
said
as
though
all
the
folk
in
venice
were
gathered
on
that
place
when
they
had
finished
shouting
the
people
began
to
criticise
finding
much
in
the
appearance
of
this
pair
that
moved
their
ready
wit
indeed
there
was
little
show
about
them
for
hugh
s
plain
armour
which
lacked
all
ornament
or
inlay
was
worn
with
war
and
travel
and
his
horse
came
along
as
soberly
as
if
it
were
going
out
to
plough
nor
was
there
anything
fine
about
the
apparel
of
grey
dick
who
wore
a
loose
chain
shirt
much
out
of
fashion
it
was
that
which
sir
andrew
had
given
to
hugh
an
iron
cap
with
and
leather
buskins
on
his
legs
in
his
hand
was
his
axe
heavy
but
not
over
large
at
his
side
hung
a
great
knife
and
on
his
back
was
the
long
black
bow
and
a
quiver
of
arrows
thus
arrayed
taking
no
heed
of
the
jests
and
chatter
of
the
multitude
they
were
led
to
the
front
of
the
bedecked
timber
stand
which
they
had
seen
on
the
previous
night
in
the
centre
of
this
stand
occupying
a
kind
of
tribune
sat
the
doge
dandolo
in
state
and
with
him
many
nobles
and
captains
while
to
right
and
left
the
whole
length
of
the
course
for
the
stand
was
very
long
were
packed
a
countless
number
of
the
men
and
women
in
venice
these
however
were
but
a
tithe
of
the
spectators
who
encircled
the
place
of
arms
in
one
serried
horde
which
was
kept
back
by
a
line
of
soldiers
arriving
in
front
of
the
doge
s
tribune
the
pair
halted
and
saluted
him
whereon
he
and
his
escort
rose
and
saluted
them
in
turn
then
another
trumpet
blew
and
from
a
second
pavilion
at
the
other
end
of
the
course
appeared
cattrina
wearing
a
splendid
suit
of
white
armour
damascened
in
gold
with
a
silver
swan
upon
the
helm
and
a
swan
painted
on
his
shield
very
fine
isn
t
it
said
grey
dick
to
his
master
only
this
time
i
hope
he
s
inside
the
steel
ask
to
see
his
face
before
you
fight
on
came
cattrina
on
a
noble
black
horse
which
pawed
and
caracoled
notwithstanding
the
heat
while
after
him
strode
a
gigantic
figure
also
clad
from
top
to
toe
in
white
mail
who
fiercely
brandished
a
ambrosio
said
dick
now
i
ought
to
feel
as
much
afraid
as
though
that
fellow
wore
a
yellow
cap
and
fur
cape
and
pearls
like
another
warrior
whom
we
met
last
night
yet
to
speak
the
truth
i
believe
he
has
the
fainter
heart
of
the
two
also
if
he
swings
that
chopper
about
so
much
he
ll
grow
to
the
multitude
however
the
gallant
appearance
of
this
pair
whom
they
looked
on
as
the
champions
of
venice
against
foreigners
appealed
not
a
little
amidst
clapping
of
hands
and
they
advanced
to
the
doge
s
tribune
and
there
made
their
salutations
which
the
illustrious
acknowledged
as
he
had
those
of
the
englishmen
then
the
heralds
intervened
and
again
all
the
articles
of
combat
were
read
and
translated
although
to
these
of
which
they
were
weary
hugh
and
dick
listened
little
next
they
were
asked
if
they
had
any
objections
to
make
and
with
one
voice
answered
but
on
the
same
question
being
put
to
their
adversaries
the
swiss
ambrosio
said
that
he
with
whom
he
must
fight
appeared
to
be
armed
with
a
bow
which
was
against
the
articles
thereon
dick
handed
the
bow
and
quiver
to
david
bidding
him
guard
them
until
he
asked
for
them
again
as
he
would
his
own
life
in
the
event
of
his
death
however
david
was
to
give
them
to
sir
hugh
or
if
they
both
should
die
to
his
own
master
sir
geoffrey
all
of
these
things
david
promised
to
do
next
followed
a
long
discussion
as
to
whether
the
four
of
them
were
to
fight
in
pairs
cattrina
and
ambrosio
against
hugh
and
dick
simultaneously
or
whether
ambrosio
was
to
fight
alone
with
dick
and
cattrina
with
hugh
upon
cattrina
and
ambrosio
being
asked
their
wishes
the
former
said
that
he
desired
to
fight
alone
as
he
feared
lest
the
english
archer
if
he
overcame
ambrosio
should
turn
on
him
also
or
perhaps
hamstring
his
horse
then
the
englishmen
were
asked
what
they
wished
and
replied
that
they
did
not
care
how
it
was
arranged
being
ready
to
fight
either
together
or
separately
as
the
doge
might
decree
the
end
of
it
was
that
after
long
consultations
with
sundry
experts
in
such
matters
the
most
illustrious
decided
that
the
captains
ambrosio
and
richard
the
archer
should
first
engage
on
foot
and
when
that
business
was
settled
the
two
knights
should
take
their
place
in
the
arena
so
the
end
of
it
was
that
more
than
half
an
hour
after
the
combat
should
have
begun
dick
and
the
gigantic
ambrosio
found
themselves
standing
face
to
face
waiting
for
the
signal
to
engage
the
swiss
shouting
threats
and
defiance
and
grey
dick
grinning
and
watching
him
out
of
his
eyes
at
length
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
single
blast
upon
a
trumpet
now
seeing
that
dick
stood
quite
still
not
even
raising
his
axe
the
swiss
advanced
and
struck
a
mighty
blow
at
him
which
dick
avoided
by
stepping
aside
recovering
himself
again
ambrosio
struck
this
blow
dick
caught
upon
his
shield
then
as
though
he
were
afraid
began
to
retreat
slowly
at
first
but
afterward
faster
till
his
walk
broke
into
a
run
at
this
sight
all
that
mighty
audience
set
up
a
hooting
coward
dog
pig
of
an
englishman
they
yelled
and
the
louder
they
yelled
the
more
quickly
did
grey
dick
run
till
at
last
even
hugh
grew
puzzled
wondering
what
was
in
his
mind
and
hoping
that
he
would
change
it
soon
so
the
audience
hooted
and
grey
dick
ran
and
the
giant
swiss
lumbered
along
after
him
bellowing
triumphantly
and
brandishing
his
which
it
was
noted
never
seemed
to
be
quite
long
enough
to
reach
his
flying
foe
when
this
had
gone
on
for
two
or
three
minutes
grey
dick
stumbled
and
fell
the
swiss
who
was
following
fast
likewise
tripped
and
fell
over
him
heavily
whereon
the
multitude
shouted
foul
play
a
dirty
foreign
trick
in
an
instant
dick
was
up
again
and
had
leapt
upon
the
prostrate
swiss
as
all
thought
to
kill
him
but
instead
the
only
thing
he
did
was
to
get
behind
him
and
kick
him
with
his
foot
until
he
also
rose
thereat
some
laughed
but
others
who
had
bets
upon
their
champion
groaned
now
the
swiss
having
lost
his
shield
in
his
fall
rushed
at
dick
grasping
his
axe
with
both
hands
as
before
the
englishman
avoided
the
blow
but
for
the
first
time
he
struck
back
catching
the
giant
on
the
shoulder
though
not
very
heavily
then
with
a
shout
of
st
george
and
england
he
went
in
at
him
hither
and
thither
sprang
dick
now
out
of
reach
of
the
axe
of
the
swiss
and
now
beneath
his
guard
but
ever
as
he
sprang
he
delivered
blow
upon
blow
each
harder
than
the
last
till
there
appeared
scars
and
rents
in
the
fine
white
mail
soon
it
became
clear
that
the
great
swiss
was
overmatched
and
spent
he
breathed
heavily
his
strokes
grew
wild
he
recovered
himself
and
at
last
in
his
turn
began
to
fly
in
good
earnest
now
after
him
went
dick
battering
at
his
back
but
as
all
might
see
with
the
flat
of
his
axe
not
with
its
edge
yes
he
was
beating
him
as
a
man
might
beat
a
carpet
beating
him
till
he
roared
with
pain
fight
ambrosio
fight
don
t
fly
shouted
the
crowd
and
he
tried
to
wheel
round
only
to
be
knocked
prostrate
by
a
single
blow
upon
the
head
which
the
englishman
delivered
with
the
back
of
his
axe
then
dick
was
seen
to
kneel
upon
him
and
cut
the
lashings
of
his
helmet
with
his
dagger
doubtless
to
give
the
de
or
so
they
thought
our
man
is
murdered
yelled
the
common
people
while
those
of
the
better
sort
remained
shamed
and
silent
dick
rose
and
they
groaned
thinking
that
all
was
done
but
lo
stooping
down
he
helped
the
breathless
swiss
whom
he
had
disarmed
to
his
feet
then
taking
him
by
the
nape
of
the
neck
which
was
easy
as
his
helmet
was
off
with
one
hand
while
in
the
other
he
held
his
bared
knife
dick
thrust
him
before
him
till
they
reached
the
tribune
of
the
doge
be
pleased
to
tell
the
illustrious
he
said
to
sir
geoffrey
that
this
braggart
having
surrendered
i
spared
his
life
and
now
return
him
to
his
brother
the
page
quite
unharmed
since
i
did
not
wish
to
wound
one
who
was
in
my
power
from
the
first
only
when
he
gets
home
i
pray
that
he
will
look
at
his
back
in
a
glass
and
judge
which
of
us
it
is
that
has
been
beaten
to
a
let
him
return
thanks
also
to
his
patron
saint
who
put
pity
in
my
heart
so
that
i
did
not
cut
him
into
collops
as
i
promised
for
know
sir
that
when
i
walked
out
yonder
it
was
my
purpose
to
hew
off
his
hands
and
shorten
him
at
the
knees
stay
one
word
more
if
yonder
boaster
has
more
brothers
who
really
wish
to
fight
i
ll
take
them
one
by
one
and
swear
to
them
that
this
time
i
ll
not
give
back
a
step
unless
i
m
do
you
indeed
yield
and
accept
the
englishman
s
mercy
asked
the
doge
in
a
stern
voice
the
poor
ambrosio
making
no
answer
blundered
forward
among
the
crowd
and
there
vanished
and
this
was
the
last
that
dick
ever
saw
or
heard
of
him
but
although
he
waited
there
a
while
feeling
the
edge
of
his
axe
and
glaring
about
him
none
of
the
captain
s
companions
came
forward
to
accept
his
challenge
at
length
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
dick
turned
having
taken
his
bow
and
quiver
from
david
who
could
not
conceal
his
indecent
joy
at
the
utter
humiliation
of
ambrosio
whom
he
hated
with
a
truly
british
hate
he
walked
slowly
to
where
hugh
sat
upon
his
horse
the
jest
is
done
master
and
now
for
good
earnest
since
tis
your
turn
the
saints
save
me
such
another
cow
hunt
in
this
hell
s
heat
had
i
killed
him
at
once
i
should
be
cooler
now
but
it
came
into
my
mind
to
let
the
hound
live
indeed
to
speak
truth
i
thought
that
i
heard
the
voice
of
murgh
behind
me
saying
spare
and
knew
that
i
must
i
hope
he
will
say
nothing
of
the
sort
to
me
presently
answered
hugh
if
he
is
here
which
i
doubt
why
what
is
it
now
those
marshals
are
talking
talking
they
were
evidently
at
the
instance
of
cattrina
or
his
counsellors
who
had
raised
some
new
objections
which
sir
geoffrey
stepped
forward
to
explain
to
them
but
hugh
would
not
even
hear
him
out
tell
the
man
and
all
whom
it
may
concern
he
said
in
an
angry
voice
that
i
am
ready
to
fight
him
as
he
will
on
horse
or
on
foot
with
lance
or
sword
or
axe
or
dagger
or
any
or
all
of
them
in
mail
or
without
it
or
if
it
pleases
him
stripped
to
the
shirt
only
let
him
settle
swiftly
since
unless
the
sweat
runs
into
my
eyes
and
dims
them
it
seems
to
me
that
night
is
coming
before
it
is
you
are
right
answered
sir
geoffrey
this
gathering
gloom
is
ominous
and
fearful
i
think
that
some
awesome
tempest
must
be
about
to
burst
also
it
seems
to
me
that
cattrina
has
no
stomach
for
this
fray
else
he
would
not
raise
so
many
points
of
martial
law
and
then
wiping
his
brow
with
a
silken
handkerchief
he
returned
to
deliver
the
message
now
hugh
and
dick
watching
saw
that
cattrina
and
those
who
advised
him
could
find
no
further
loophole
for
argument
they
saw
moreover
that
the
doge
grew
angry
for
he
rose
in
his
seat
throwing
off
his
velvet
robe
of
office
of
which
it
appeared
that
he
could
no
longer
bear
the
weight
and
spoke
in
a
hard
voice
to
cattrina
and
his
squires
next
once
more
the
titles
of
the
combatants
were
read
and
their
cause
of
combat
and
while
this
went
on
hugh
bade
dick
bind
about
his
right
arm
a
certain
red
ribbon
that
eve
had
given
him
saying
that
he
wished
to
fight
wearing
his
lady
s
favour
dick
obeyed
muttering
that
he
thought
such
humours
foolish
and
that
a
knight
might
as
well
wear
a
woman
s
petticoat
as
her
ribbon
by
now
so
dim
had
the
light
grown
he
could
scarce
see
to
tie
the
knot
indeed
the
weather
was
very
strange
from
the
dark
lowering
sky
above
a
palpable
blackness
sank
downward
as
though
the
clouds
themselves
were
falling
of
their
own
weight
while
from
the
sea
great
rolls
of
vapour
came
sweeping
in
like
waves
also
this
sea
itself
had
found
a
voice
for
although
it
was
so
calm
it
moaned
like
a
world
in
pain
the
great
multitude
began
to
murmur
and
their
faces
lifted
upward
toward
the
sky
grew
ghastly
white
fear
they
knew
not
of
what
had
got
hold
of
them
a
voice
cried
shrilly
let
them
fight
and
have
done
we
would
get
home
ere
the
tempest
the
first
trumpet
blew
and
the
horses
of
the
knights
which
whinnied
uneasily
were
led
to
their
stations
the
second
trumpet
blew
and
the
knights
laid
their
lances
in
rest
then
ere
the
third
trumpet
could
sound
suddenly
the
darkness
of
midnight
swallowed
all
the
scene
dick
groped
his
way
to
hugh
s
side
bide
where
you
are
he
said
the
end
of
the
world
is
here
let
us
meet
it
like
men
and
ay
answered
hugh
and
his
voice
rang
hollow
through
his
closed
visor
without
doubt
it
is
the
end
of
the
world
and
murgh
the
minister
has
been
sent
to
open
the
doors
of
heaven
and
hell
god
have
mercy
on
us
all
so
they
stayed
there
hearkening
to
the
groans
and
prayers
of
the
terrified
multitude
about
them
dick
holding
the
bridle
of
the
horse
which
shook
from
head
to
foot
but
never
stirred
for
some
minutes
they
remained
thus
till
suddenly
the
sky
began
to
lighten
but
with
no
natural
light
the
colour
of
it
of
the
earth
beneath
and
of
the
air
between
was
a
deep
terrible
red
that
caused
all
things
to
seem
as
though
they
were
dyed
in
blood
lighter
and
lighter
and
redder
and
redder
it
grew
the
long
stand
and
the
pavilions
became
visible
and
after
them
the
dense
deep
ring
of
spectators
many
of
these
were
kneeling
while
others
who
could
find
no
space
to
kneel
held
their
hands
upstretched
toward
heaven
or
beat
their
breasts
and
wept
in
the
emotional
fashion
of
the
country
yet
not
on
them
were
the
eyes
of
hugh
and
grey
dick
fixed
but
rather
on
a
single
figure
which
stood
quite
alone
in
the
midst
of
that
great
arena
where
cattrina
and
his
horse
should
have
been
where
they
had
been
indeed
but
a
little
while
before
the
figure
was
clothed
in
a
red
and
yellow
cap
shaped
like
a
cock
in
black
furs
a
yellow
robe
and
white
gloves
and
sandals
yonder
it
stood
fantastic
fearful
its
bare
and
brawny
arms
crossed
upon
its
breast
its
head
bowed
as
though
it
contemplated
the
ground
there
was
not
an
eye
of
all
the
tens
of
thousands
of
those
who
were
present
that
did
not
see
it
there
was
not
a
voice
that
did
not
break
into
a
yell
of
terror
and
hate
till
the
earth
shook
with
such
a
sound
as
might
reverberate
through
the
choked
abyss
of
hell
the
fiend
the
fiend
the
fiend
said
the
shout
kill
him
kill
him
kill
him
the
figure
looked
up
the
red
light
shone
upon
its
stony
face
that
seemed
one
blotch
of
white
amidst
its
glow
then
it
stooped
down
and
lifted
from
the
sand
a
knight
s
lance
such
as
cattrina
had
held
it
raised
the
lance
and
with
it
pointed
four
times
east
and
west
and
north
and
south
holding
it
finally
for
a
while
in
the
direction
of
the
tribune
where
sat
the
doge
with
all
his
noble
company
and
of
venice
beyond
lastly
with
a
quick
and
easy
motion
it
cast
the
lance
toward
the
sky
whence
it
fell
remaining
fixed
point
downward
in
the
earth
then
a
tongue
of
mist
that
had
crept
up
from
the
sea
enveloped
it
and
when
that
mist
cleared
away
the
shape
was
gone
now
the
red
haze
thinned
and
for
the
first
time
that
morning
the
sun
shone
out
in
a
sickly
fashion
although
their
nerves
were
torn
by
the
unnatural
darkness
and
the
apparition
that
followed
it
which
all
saw
yet
none
quite
believed
that
they
had
seen
the
multitude
shouted
for
the
combat
to
proceed
once
more
hugh
laid
his
lance
in
rest
thinking
that
cattrina
was
there
although
he
could
not
see
him
then
the
third
trumpet
rang
out
in
that
silence
it
sounded
like
the
blast
of
doom
and
hugh
spurred
his
horse
forward
a
little
way
but
halted
for
he
could
perceive
no
foe
advancing
against
him
he
stared
about
him
and
at
last
in
a
rage
threw
his
lance
to
a
squire
and
turning
his
horse
galloped
to
the
tribune
there
he
pulled
it
to
his
haunches
and
shouted
out
in
a
great
voice
where
is
cattrina
am
i
to
be
fooled
who
appear
here
as
the
champion
of
the
king
of
england
where
is
cattrina
produce
cattrina
that
i
may
slay
him
or
be
slain
or
chivalry
of
venice
be
forever
shamed
the
doge
rose
uttering
swift
commands
and
heralds
ran
here
and
there
knights
and
captains
searched
the
pavilions
and
every
other
place
where
a
mounted
man
might
hide
but
they
never
found
cattrina
and
returning
at
length
confessed
as
much
with
bowed
heads
the
doge
maddened
by
this
ignominy
seized
the
great
gold
chain
upon
his
beast
and
burst
it
in
two
cattrina
has
fled
he
shouted
or
satan
himself
has
carried
him
away
at
the
least
let
his
name
be
erased
from
the
golden
book
of
venice
and
until
he
prove
himself
innocent
let
no
noble
of
venice
stretch
out
to
him
the
hand
of
fellowship
men
of
venice
for
you
cattrina
and
his
house
are
will
none
take
up
his
cause
and
fight
for
him
asked
hugh
through
sir
geoffrey
and
presently
at
the
doge
s
command
the
challenge
was
repeated
thrice
by
the
herald
but
to
it
no
answer
came
of
this
afterward
hugh
was
glad
since
it
was
cattrina
s
life
he
sought
not
that
of
any
other
man
then
hugh
spoke
again
saying
i
claim
o
illustrious
that
i
be
written
down
as
victor
in
this
combat
to
the
death
bloodless
through
no
fault
of
it
shall
be
so
written
noble
hugh
de
cressi
said
the
doge
let
all
venice
take
notice
as
the
words
left
his
lips
the
solid
earth
began
to
heave
and
rock
at
the
first
heave
hugh
leaped
from
his
horse
which
screamed
aloud
and
fled
away
and
gripped
hold
of
grey
dick
at
the
second
the
multitude
broke
out
into
wild
cries
prayers
and
blasphemies
and
rushed
this
way
and
that
at
the
third
which
came
quite
slowly
and
was
the
greatest
of
them
all
the
long
stand
of
timber
bent
its
flags
toward
him
as
though
in
salute
then
with
a
slow
grinding
crash
fell
over
entangling
all
within
it
beneath
its
ruin
also
in
the
city
beyond
houses
whole
streets
of
them
gabled
churches
and
tall
towers
sank
to
the
earth
while
where
they
had
been
rose
up
wreathed
columns
of
dust
to
the
south
the
sea
became
agitated
spouts
of
foam
appeared
upon
its
smooth
face
it
drew
back
from
the
land
revealing
the
slime
of
ages
and
embedded
therein
wrecks
it
heaped
itself
up
like
a
mountain
then
with
a
swift
and
dreadful
motion
advanced
again
in
one
vast
wave
in
an
instant
all
that
multitude
were
in
full
flight
hugh
and
dick
fled
like
the
rest
and
with
them
david
though
whither
they
went
they
knew
not
all
they
knew
was
that
the
ground
leapt
and
quivered
beneath
their
feet
while
behind
them
came
the
horrible
seething
hiss
of
water
on
the
crest
of
which
men
were
tossed
up
and
down
like
bits
of
floating
wood
chapter

the
death
at
work
presently
hugh
halted
taking
shelter
with
his
two
companions
behind
the
stone
wall
of
a
shed
that
the
earthquake
had
shattered
for
here
they
could
not
be
trodden
down
by
the
mob
of
fugitives
the
wave
has
spent
itself
he
said
pointing
to
the
line
of
foam
that
now
retreated
toward
the
ocean
taking
with
it
many
drowned
or
drowning
men
let
us
return
and
seek
for
sir
geoffrey
it
will
be
shameful
if
we
leave
him
trapped
yonder
like
a
dick
nodded
and
making
a
wide
circuit
to
avoid
the
maddened
crowd
they
came
safely
to
the
wrecked
stand
where
they
had
last
seen
sir
geoffrey
talking
with
the
doge
every
minute
indeed
the
mob
grew
thinner
since
the
most
of
them
had
already
passed
treading
the
life
out
of
those
who
fell
as
they
went
from
this
stand
more
than
three
fourths
of
those
who
were
seated
there
had
already
broken
out
since
it
had
not
fallen
utterly
and
by
good
fortune
was
open
on
all
sides
some
however
tangled
in
the
canvas
roof
were
still
trying
to
escape
other
poor
creatures
had
been
crushed
to
death
or
lay
helpless
or
worse
still
were
held
down
beneath
the
fallen
beams
several
of
these
they
freed
whereon
those
who
were
unharmed
at
once
ran
away
without
thanking
them
but
for
a
long
while
they
could
find
no
trace
of
sir
geoffrey
indeed
they
were
near
to
abandoning
their
search
for
the
sights
and
sounds
were
sickening
even
to
men
who
were
accustomed
to
those
of
battlefields
when
dick
s
quick
ears
caught
the
tones
of
an
english
voice
calling
for
help
apparently
it
came
from
the
back
of
the
doge
s
tribune
where
lay
a
heap
of
dead
gaily
dressed
folk
who
had
fallen
in
the
flight
and
been
crushed
not
by
the
earthquake
but
by
the
feet
of
their
fellows
these
blackened
and
disfigured
men
and
women
they
dragged
away
with
much
toil
and
at
last
to
their
joy
beneath
them
all
found
sir
geoffrey
carleon
in
another
few
minutes
he
must
have
died
for
he
was
almost
suffocated
indeed
he
would
certainly
have
perished
with
the
others
had
he
not
been
thrown
under
a
fixed
bench
whence
one
leg
projected
which
as
they
could
see
at
once
was
crushed
and
broken
they
drew
him
out
as
gently
as
they
could
and
gave
him
water
to
drink
whereof
mercifully
for
them
all
since
by
now
they
were
utterly
parched
with
thirst
they
had
discovered
a
large
silver
pitcher
full
standing
in
the
corner
of
a
little
to
the
tribune
it
was
half
hidden
with
fragments
of
fine
dresses
and
even
jewels
torn
from
the
persons
of
the
lords
and
ladies
i
thank
you
friends
he
said
faintly
i
prayed
them
to
keep
seated
but
they
went
mad
and
would
not
listen
those
behind
trod
down
those
in
front
till
that
doorway
was
choked
and
i
was
hurled
beneath
the
bench
oh
it
was
terrible
to
hear
them
dying
about
me
and
to
know
that
soon
i
must
follow
this
had
it
not
been
for
you
i
should
have
done
for
my
leg
is
crushed
and
there
was
no
then
having
drunk
and
drunk
until
even
their
raging
thirst
was
satisfied
they
found
a
plank
laying
sir
geoffrey
on
it
they
departed
from
that
human
shambles
whence
the
piteous
cries
of
those
still
imprisoned
there
whom
they
could
not
reach
pursued
them
horribly
thus
slowly
enough
for
there
were
but
three
of
them
two
hampered
by
their
mail
they
bore
sir
geoffrey
across
the
place
of
arms
save
for
the
dead
and
dying
and
some
knaves
who
plundered
them
by
this
time
it
was
almost
deserted
indeed
a
large
band
of
these
wretches
who
had
emerged
like
wolves
from
their
lairs
in
the
lowest
quarters
of
the
great
city
catching
sight
of
the
gold
chain
sir
geoffrey
wore
ran
up
with
drawn
daggers
to
kill
and
rob
them
seeing
them
come
grey
dick
slipped
the
black
bow
from
its
case
and
sent
an
arrow
singing
through
the
heart
of
the
villain
who
captained
them
thereon
the
rest
left
him
where
he
fell
and
ran
off
to
steal
and
slay
elsewhere
then
without
a
word
dick
unstrung
the
bow
and
once
more
laid
hold
of
an
end
of
the
plank
they
came
to
the
mouth
of
that
street
where
the
bravoes
had
waylaid
them
on
the
previous
night
only
to
find
that
they
could
not
pass
this
way
here
most
of
the
houses
were
thrown
down
and
from
their
ruins
rose
smoke
and
the
hideous
screams
of
those
who
perished
it
was
this
part
of
venice
the
home
of
the
poorer
folk
which
suffered
most
from
the
earthquake
that
had
scarcely
touched
many
of
the
finer
quarters
still
it
was
reckoned
afterward
that
in
all
it
took
a
toll
of
nearly
ten
thousand
lives
turning
from
this
street
they
made
their
way
to
the
banks
of
a
great
canal
that
here
ran
into
the
harbour
that
on
which
they
had
been
rowed
to
the
place
of
arms
here
by
good
luck
they
found
a
small
boat
floating
keep
uppermost
for
it
had
been
overturned
by
the
number
of
people
who
crowded
into
it
this
boat
they
righted
with
much
toil
and
discovered
within
it
a
drowned
lady
also
an
oar
caught
beneath
the
seat
after
this
their
dreadful
journey
was
easy
at
least
by
comparison
for
now
all
the
gloom
had
rolled
away
the
sun
shone
out
and
a
fresh
and
pleasant
wind
blew
from
the
sea
toward
the
land
so
at
last
passing
many
sad
and
strange
scenes
that
need
not
be
described
they
came
safely
to
the
steps
of
the
ambassador
s
beautiful
house
which
was
quite
uninjured
here
they
found
several
of
his
servants
wringing
their
hands
and
weeping
for
word
had
been
brought
to
them
that
he
was
dead
also
in
the
hall
they
were
met
by
another
woe
for
there
on
a
couch
lay
stretched
the
lady
carleon
smitten
with
some
dread
sickness
which
caused
blood
to
flow
from
her
mouth
and
ears
a
physician
was
bending
over
her
for
by
good
fortune
one
had
been
found
sir
geoffrey
asked
him
what
ailed
his
wife
he
answered
that
he
did
not
know
having
never
seen
the
like
till
that
morning
when
he
had
been
called
in
to
attend
three
such
cases
in
houses
far
apart
whereof
one
died
within
ten
minutes
of
being
struck
just
then
lady
carleon
s
senses
returned
and
opening
her
eyes
she
saw
sir
geoffrey
whom
they
had
laid
down
upon
another
couch
close
to
her
oh
they
told
me
that
you
were
dead
husband
she
said
crushed
or
swallowed
in
the
earthquake
but
i
thank
god
they
lied
yet
what
ails
you
sweetheart
that
you
do
not
stand
upon
your
feet
little
dear
wife
little
he
answered
in
a
cheerful
voice
my
foot
is
somewhat
crushed
that
is
all
still
tis
true
that
had
it
not
been
for
this
brave
knight
and
his
squire
i
must
have
lain
where
i
was
till
i
now
lady
carleon
raised
herself
slightly
and
looked
at
hugh
and
dick
who
stood
together
bewildered
and
overwhelmed
heaven
s
blessings
be
on
your
heads
she
exclaimed
for
these
venetians
would
surely
have
left
him
to
his
doom
ah
i
thought
that
it
was
you
who
must
die
but
now
i
know
it
is
i
and
perchance
my
lord
physician
she
added
after
a
pause
trouble
not
with
me
for
my
hour
has
come
i
feel
it
at
my
heart
tend
my
lord
there
who
unless
this
foul
sickness
takes
him
also
may
yet
be
so
they
carried
them
both
to
their
own
large
sleeping
chamber
on
the
upper
floor
there
the
surgeon
set
sir
geoffrey
s
broken
bone
skilfully
enough
though
when
he
saw
the
state
of
the
crushed
limb
he
shook
his
head
and
said
it
would
be
best
to
cut
it
off
this
however
sir
geoffrey
would
not
suffer
to
be
done
it
will
kill
me
i
am
sure
or
if
not
then
the
pest
which
that
ship
of
the
has
brought
here
from
cyprus
will
do
its
work
on
me
but
i
care
nothing
for
since
you
say
that
my
wife
must
die
i
would
die
with
her
and
be
at
at
sunset
lady
carleon
died
ere
she
passed
away
she
sent
for
hugh
and
dick
her
bed
by
her
command
had
been
moved
to
an
open
window
for
she
seemed
to
crave
air
by
it
was
placed
that
of
sir
geoffrey
so
that
the
two
of
them
could
hold
each
other
s
hand
i
would
die
looking
toward
england
sir
hugh
she
said
with
a
faint
smile
though
alas
i
may
not
sleep
in
that
churchyard
on
the
sussex
downs
where
i
had
hoped
that
i
might
lie
at
last
now
sir
hugh
i
pray
this
of
your
christian
charity
and
by
the
english
blood
which
runs
in
us
that
you
will
swear
to
me
that
you
and
your
squire
will
not
leave
my
lord
alone
among
these
southern
folk
but
that
you
will
bide
with
him
and
nurse
him
till
he
recovers
or
dies
as
god
may
will
also
that
you
will
see
me
buried
by
the
bones
of
my
child
they
will
tell
you
wife
broke
in
sir
geoffrey
this
knight
is
not
of
our
kin
doubtless
he
has
business
elsewhere
how
can
he
bide
with
me
here
mayhap
for
weeks
but
lady
carleon
who
could
speak
no
more
only
looked
at
hugh
who
answered
fear
nothing
here
we
will
stay
until
he
recovers
unless
he
added
we
ourselves
should
she
smiled
at
him
gratefully
then
turned
her
face
toward
sir
geoffrey
and
pressed
his
hand
so
presently
she
passed
away
the
tears
running
from
her
faded
eyes
when
it
was
over
and
the
women
had
covered
her
hugh
and
dick
left
the
room
for
they
could
bear
no
more
i
have
seen
sad
sights
said
hugh
with
something
like
a
sob
but
never
before
one
so
ay
answered
dick
that
of
the
wounded
dying
on
crecy
field
was
a
may
day
revel
compared
to
this
though
it
is
but
one
old
woman
who
has
gone
oh
how
heavily
they
parted
who
have
dwelt
together
these
forty
years
and
twas
my
careless
tongue
this
morning
that
foretold
it
as
a
jest
in
the
hall
they
met
the
physician
who
rushed
through
the
doorway
to
ask
how
his
patients
fared
ah
he
said
to
them
in
french
when
he
knew
well
signors
that
noble
lady
has
not
gone
alone
i
tell
you
that
scores
of
whom
i
know
are
already
dead
in
venice
swept
off
by
this
swift
and
horrible
plague
death
and
all
his
angels
stalk
through
the
city
they
say
that
he
himself
appeared
last
night
and
this
morning
on
the
tilting
ground
by
the
quay
and
by
god
s
mercy
if
he
has
any
left
for
us
i
can
well
believe
it
the
doge
and
his
council
but
now
have
issued
a
decree
that
all
who
perish
must
be
buried
at
once
see
to
it
signors
lest
the
officers
come
and
bear
her
away
to
some
common
grave
from
which
her
rank
will
not
protect
then
he
went
to
visit
sir
geoffrey
returning
presently
he
gave
them
some
directions
as
to
his
treatment
and
rushed
out
as
he
had
rushed
in
they
never
saw
him
again
two
days
later
they
learned
that
he
himself
was
dead
of
the
pest
that
night
they
buried
lady
carleon
in
her
son
s
grave
which
dick
had
helped
to
prepare
for
her
since
no
sexton
could
be
bribed
to
do
the
work
indeed
these
were
all
busy
enough
attending
to
the
interment
of
the
great
ones
of
venice
in
that
churchyard
alone
they
saw
six
buryings
in
progress
also
after
the
priest
had
read
his
hurried
office
as
they
left
the
gates
whence
lady
carleon
s
bearers
had
already
fled
affrighted
they
met
more
melancholy
processions
heralded
by
a
torch
or
two
whereof
the
light
fell
upon
some
sheeted
and
uncoffined
form

hugh
only
groaned
in
answer
such
was
the
beginning
of
the
awful
plague
which
travelled
from
the
east
to
venice
and
all
europe
and
afterward
became
known
by
the
name
of
the
black
death
day
by
day
the
number
of
its
victims
increased
the
hundreds
of
yesterday
were
the
thousands
of
the
morrow
soon
the
graveyards
were
full
the
plague
pits
long
and
deep
were
full
and
the
dead
were
taken
out
to
sea
by
shiploads
and
there
cast
into
the
ocean
at
length
even
this
could
not
be
done
since
none
were
forthcoming
who
would
dare
the
task
for
it
became
known
that
those
who
did
so
themselves
would
surely
die
so
where
folk
fell
there
they
lay
in
the
houses
were
many
of
them
they
cumbered
and
poisoned
the
streets
and
the
very
churches
even
the
animals
sickened
and
perished
until
that
great
city
was
turned
into
an
open
tomb
the
reek
of
it
tainted
the
air
for
miles
around
so
that
even
those
who
passed
it
in
ships
far
out
to
sea
turned
faint
and
presently
themselves
sickened
and
died
but
ere
they
died
they
bore
on
the
fatal
gift
to
other
lands
moreover
starvation
fell
upon
the
place
though
the
houses
were
full
of
riches
these
would
scarce
suffice
to
buy
bread
for
those
who
remained
alive
the
doge
and
some
of
his
council
passed
laws
to
lighten
the
misery
of
the
people
but
soon
few
heeded
these
laws
which
none
were
left
to
enforce
the
vagabonds
and
men
who
began
by
robbing
the
deserted
houses
of
jewels
money
and
plate
ended
by
searching
them
for
food
and
casting
aside
their
treasures
as
worthless
dross
it
was
even
said
that
some
of
them
did
worse
things
things
not
to
be
named
since
in
its
extremities
nature
knows
no
shame
only
if
bread
and
meat
were
scarce
wine
remained
in
plenty
in
the
midst
of
death
men
yes
and
women
who
perhaps
had
deserted
their
wives
their
husbands
or
their
children
fearing
to
take
the
evil
from
them
made
the
nights
horrible
by
their
drunken
blasphemies
and
revellings
as
sailors
sometimes
do
upon
a
sinking
ship
knowing
that
they
must
die
they
wished
to
die
merry
sir
geoffrey
carleon
lived
a
long
while
after
the
death
of
his
wife
when
he
passed
away
at
last
ten
days
or
so
later
it
was
painlessly
of
the
mortification
of
his
broken
limb
not
of
the
pest
which
went
by
him
as
though
it
knew
that
he
was
already
doomed
all
this
time
hugh
grey
dick
and
david
day
nursed
him
without
ceasing
indeed
with
the
exception
of
a
woman
so
ancient
and
shrivelled
that
nothing
seemed
able
to
harm
her
any
more
no
one
else
was
left
in
the
great
for
all
the
rest
of
the
household
had
perished
or
fled
away
this
woman
who
was
the
grandmother
of
one
of
the
servants
now
dead
of
the
plague
cooked
their
food
of
such
provision
fortunately
there
was
much
laid
up
in
the
storerooms
for
use
in
the
winter
since
lady
carleon
had
been
a
good
and
provident
housewife
so
those
three
did
not
starve
although
sir
geoffrey
would
touch
little
of
the
salted
stuff
he
existed
on
a
few
fruits
when
they
could
get
them
and
after
these
were
gone
on
wine
mingled
with
water
at
length
came
the
end
for
two
days
he
had
lain
senseless
one
night
however
david
who
was
watching
in
his
chamber
crept
into
the
room
where
hugh
slept
hard
by
and
told
them
that
sir
geoffrey
was
awake
and
calling
them
they
rose
and
went
to
him
by
the
light
of
the
moon
which
shone
in
at
the
open
window
that
same
window
through
which
lady
carleon
had
looked
toward
england
ere
she
passed
away
they
saw
him
lying
quietly
a
happy
smile
upon
his
face
friends
he
said
in
a
weak
voice
by
the
mercy
of
god
i
go
out
of
this
hell
to
heaven
or
so
i
think
but
if
indeed
this
be
not
the
end
of
the
world
i
hope
that
you
who
have
lived
so
long
will
continue
to
live
and
i
have
sent
for
you
to
bless
you
and
to
thank
you
both
in
yonder
case
are
certain
papers
that
have
to
do
with
the
king
s
business
i
pray
you
deliver
them
to
his
grace
if
you
can
and
with
them
my
homage
and
my
thanks
for
the
trust
that
he
has
reposed
in
me
tell
him
what
i
have
not
written
in
the
letters
and
here
he
smiled
faintly
that
i
think
that
few
of
his
creditors
in
venice
will
trouble
him
at
present
though
afterward
their
heirs
if
they
have
left
any
may
do
so
say
too
to
the
doge
who
i
believe
still
lives
that
i
send
him
my
good
wishes
and
respects
also
that
i
grieve
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
hand
him
my
letters
of
recall
in
person
since
the
king
who
summons
me
sends
none
so
much
for
business
but
there
are
two
things
more
i
have
no
relatives
living
save
my
wife
s
sister
therefore
sir
hugh
and
captain
richard
i
have
made
you
my
joint
heirs
with
her
my
testament
duly
signed
and
witnessed
is
in
that
case
with
the
other
papers
my
wealth
is
not
great
still
there
are
certain
land
and
manors
in
england
a
sum
of
money
placed
with
a
merchant
in
london
whose
name
you
will
find
written
in
the
testament
my
plate
and
gold
coin
here
though
the
former
you
may
not
be
able
to
move
therefore
i
charge
you
to
bury
it
and
return
for
it
later
on
if
you
can
it
is
of
value
since
all
my
life
i
have
collected
such
trinkets
i
beg
you
to
make
provision
also
for
this
good
lad
david
should
he
be
he
paused
a
while
for
he
was
growing
very
weak
then
added
another
thing
is
that
i
ask
you
if
it
be
possible
to
row
my
body
out
to
sea
and
there
sink
it
in
deep
water
deep
clean
water
far
from
this
place
of
stench
and
pestilence
for
i
would
not
lie
in
the
common
pit
at
last
now
kneel
down
and
pray
for
my
passing
soul
since
there
is
no
priest
to
give
me
absolution
and
i
must
seek
it
straight
from
god
nay
thank
me
not
i
have
done
with
the
world
and
its
affairs
kneel
down
and
pray
as
i
pray
for
you
that
you
may
be
spared
on
earth
and
that
we
may
meet
again
in
heaven
where
my
wife
and
others
await
they
obeyed
weeping
yes
even
grey
dick
wept
a
little
presently
when
they
looked
up
they
saw
that
sir
geoffrey
was
dead
dead
without
pain
or
sorrow
of
the
first
he
had
suffered
none
for
days
and
the
second
was
far
from
him
who
wished
to
die
leaving
the
ancient
woman
in
charge
of
the
house
which
she
barred
and
bolted
next
morning
they
took
a
boat
and
the
three
of
them
rowed
the
body
of
the
old
knight
a
league
out
into
the
quiet
sea
there
after
a
brief
prayer
they
cast
him
into
the
deep
weighted
with
stones
so
that
he
might
never
rise
again
then
they
returned
not
too
soon
for
they
found
thieves
in
the
act
of
breaking
into
the
house
probably
in
search
of
food
these
miserable
men
they
spared
though
they
could
have
killed
them
easily
enough
they
even
gave
them
a
pouch
full
of
biscuit
and
dried
meat
ere
they
dismissed
them
this
they
did
quickly
since
one
of
them
as
they
could
see
was
already
stricken
by
the
plague
and
had
not
long
to
live
when
they
were
gone
the
old
woman
being
out
of
the
house
whence
she
had
fled
on
hearing
the
robbers
they
collected
all
sir
geoffrey
s
and
his
lady
s
jewels
and
plate
of
which
there
was
much
for
he
lived
in
state
in
venice
as
became
an
ambassador
these
they
buried
in
three
large
iron
boxes
beneath
the
flagstones
of
the
cellar
the
safest
place
that
they
could
find
having
thrown
the
excavated
earth
into
the
canal
under
cover
of
the
dark
they
replaced
these
stones
and
strewed
dust
over
them
wondering
whether
it
would
ever
be
their
lot
to
look
upon
these
chests
and
their
contents
again
they
left
the
cellar
to
find
the
old
woman
knocking
at
the
back
door
of
the
house
whither
she
had
returned
frightened
by
the
sights
and
sounds
in
the
city
they
bade
her
bring
them
food
which
they
needed
much
who
had
laboured
so
hard
on
that
sorrowful
day
and
after
they
had
eaten
took
counsel
together
seeing
that
all
three
of
us
are
still
in
health
as
if
there
is
anything
in
the
promises
of
murgh
we
should
remain
is
it
not
time
master
asked
grey
dick
that
we
left
this
accursed
venice
now
that
sir
geoffrey
is
gone
there
is
naught
to
keep
us
one
thing
i
have
to
do
first
answered
hugh
and
it
is
to
learn
whether
sir
edmund
acour
lord
of
cattrina
is
dead
or
living
and
if
living
where
he
hides
himself
away
while
sir
geoffrey
lay
dying
we
could
not
leave
him
to
make
search
but
now
it
is
ay
master
though
i
think
you
ll
find
the
task
hard
in
this
hive
of
pestilence
and
i
have
heard
that
the
plague
is
at
work
in
cattrina
s
palace
broke
in
david
but
when
i
asked
whether
he
were
there
or
no
none
could
tell
me
that
is
not
a
house
where
you
ll
be
welcomed
sir
still
i
will
make
bold
to
knock
at
his
doors
answered
hugh
now
let
us
seek
what
we
all
need
so
on
the
following
morning
shortly
after
sunrise
hugh
and
grey
dick
guided
by
david
took
boat
and
rowed
through
most
fearful
scenes
and
sounds
to
the
palazzo
cattrina
a
splendid
but
somewhat
dilapidated
building
situated
in
a
part
of
the
city
that
like
itself
had
seen
more
prosperous
times
the
great
doors
of
the
place
set
in
a
marble
archway
stood
half
open
over
them
were
cut
the
cognizance
of
the
floating
swan
and
beneath
in
letters
of
faded
gold
the
titles
of
acour
de
noyon
and
cattrina
no
wonder
they
were
open
since
the
porter
s
lodge
was
occupied
only
by
a
grisly
corpse
that
lay
rotting
on
the
floor
a
heavy
key
in
its
hand
the
courtyard
beyond
was
empty
and
so
save
for
a
dead
horse
were
the
stables
to
the
right
passing
up
the
steps
of
the
hall
that
also
stood
open
they
entered
here
the
place
was
in
confusion
as
though
those
who
dwelt
there
had
left
in
haste
the
mouldering
remains
of
a
meal
lay
on
the
broad
oak
table
a
great
inlaid
with
ivory
but
half
filled
with
arms
and
armour
stood
wide
a
silver
crucifix
that
had
hung
above
was
torn
down
and
cast
upon
the
floor
perchance
by
thieves
who
had
found
it
too
heavy
to
bear
away
the
earthquake
had
thrown
over
a
carved
cabinet
and
some
bowls
of
glazed
ware
that
stood
upon
it
these
lay
about
shattered
amidst
shields
and
swords
thrown
from
the
walls
where
pictures
of
saints
or
perchance
of
dead
cattrinas
hung
all
awry
in
short
if
an
army
had
sacked
it
this
stately
hall
could
scarce
have
seemed
more
ruined
hugh
and
dick
crossed
it
to
a
stairway
of
chestnut
wood
whereof
every
was
surmounted
by
the
crest
of
a
swan
and
searched
the
saloons
above
where
also
there
was
wreck
and
ruin
then
still
mounting
the
stair
they
came
to
the
from
one
of
these
they
retreated
hastily
since
on
entering
it
hundreds
of
flies
buzzing
in
a
corner
advised
them
that
something
lay
there
which
they
did
not
wish
to
see
let
us
be
going
i
grow
sick
exclaimed
hugh
but
dick
who
had
the
ears
of
a
fox
held
up
his
hand
and
said
hark
i
hear
a
following
the
sound
he
led
his
master
down
two
long
corridors
that
ended
in
a
chapel
there
lying
before
the
altar
they
found
a
man
clad
in
a
filthy
priest
s
robe
a
dying
man
who
still
had
the
strength
to
cry
for
help
or
mercy
although
in
truth
he
was
wasted
to
a
skeleton
since
the
plague
which
had
taken
him
was
of
the
most
lingering
sort
indeed
little
seemed
to
be
left
of
him
save
his
rolling
eyes
prominent
nose
and
high
cheekbones
covered
with
yellow
parchment
that
had
been
skin
and
a
stubbly
growth
of
unshaven
hair
dick
scanned
him
dick
who
never
forgot
a
face
then
stepped
forward
and
said
so
once
more
we
meet
in
a
chapel
father
nicholas
say
how
has
it
fared
with
you
since
you
fled
through
the
chancel
door
of
that
at
blythburgh
manor
no
i
forgot
that
was
not
the
last
time
we
met
a
man
in
a
yellow
cap
ripped
off
your
mask
in
a
near
the
place
of
arms
one
night
and
said
something
which
it
did
not
please
you
to
water
moaned
nicholas
for
christ
s
sake
give
me
water
why
should
i
give
you
water
in
payment
for
your
midnight
steel
yonder
in
the
narrow
street
what
kind
of
water
was
it
that
you
gave
red
eve
far
away
at
blythburgh
town
asked
dick
in
his
hissing
voice
which
sounded
like
that
of
an
angry
snake
but
hugh
who
could
bear
no
more
of
it
ran
down
to
the
courtyard
where
he
had
seen
a
pitcher
standing
by
a
well
and
brought
water
thank
god
that
you
have
come
again
said
the
wretched
priest
as
he
snatched
at
it
for
i
can
not
bear
to
die
with
this
devil
glaring
at
me
and
he
pointed
to
grey
dick
who
leaned
against
the
chancel
wall
his
arms
folded
on
his
breast
smiling
coldly
then
he
drank
greedily
hugh
holding
the
pitcher
to
his
lips
for
his
wasted
arms
could
not
bear
its
weight
now
said
hugh
when
his
thirst
was
satisfied
tell
me
where
is
your
master
cattrina
god
or
the
fiend
can
say
alone
when
he
found
that
i
was
smitten
with
the
plague
he
left
me
to
perish
as
did
the
and
as
we
shall
do
unless
you
tell
me
whither
my
enemy
has
gone
and
hugh
made
as
though
to
leave
the
place
the
priest
clutched
at
him
with
his
filthy
hand
for
christ
s
sake
do
not
desert
me
he
moaned
let
one
christian
soul
be
near
me
at
the
last
ere
the
curse
of
that
wizard
with
the
yellow
cap
is
fulfilled
on
me
for
the
sake
of
jesus
stay
i
ll
tell
all
i
speak
then
and
be
swift
you
have
no
time
to
spare
i
when
the
darkness
fell
there
in
the
place
of
arms
began
nicholas
while
you
knights
were
waiting
for
the
third
blast
of
the
trumpet
cattrina
fled
under
cover
as
i
thought
the
accursed
coward
exclaimed
hugh
bitterly
nay
to
be
just
it
was
not
all
cowardice
the
wizard
in
the
yellow
cap
he
who
showed
himself
to
the
people
afterward
and
called
down
this
black
death
on
venice
appeared
to
him
in
the
darkness
and
said
something
to
him
that
turned
his
heart
to
water
i
think
it
was
that
if
he
stayed
within
five
short
minutes
he
d
be
dead
who
otherwise
if
he
fled
had
yet
a
breathing
space
of
life
so
he
ay
but
whither
man
whither
here
to
his
house
where
he
disguised
himself
and
bade
me
prepare
to
travel
with
him
only
then
the
sickness
took
me
and
i
could
not
so
he
went
with
some
of
his
people
riding
for
what
to
do
at
avignon
to
obtain
the
confirmation
of
his
marriage
with
the
lady
eve
clavering
it
has
been
promised
to
him
by
certain
cardinals
at
court
who
have
the
ear
of
his
holiness
the
ah
i
thought
it
what
more
only
this
tidings
reached
him
that
the
lady
clavering
with
the
old
templar
sir
andrew
arnold
journeys
to
avignon
from

the
dissolution
of
their
marriage
with
sir
edmund
acour
count
de
noyon
lord
of
cattrina
in
avignon
however
the
cause
may
go
cattrina
purposes
to
snare
and
make
her
his
which
will
be
easy
for
there
he
has
many
friends
and
she
has
except
god
exclaimed
hugh
grinding
his
teeth
and
sir
andrew
arnold
broke
in
dick
who
like
some
others
is
i
think
one
of
his
ministers
still
we
had
better
be
riding
nay
nay
cried
nicholas
in
a
hoarse
scream
tarry
a
while
and
i
ll
tell
you
that
which
will
force
the
pope
to
void
this
marriage
yes
it
shall
be
set
in
writing
and
signed
by
me
and
witnessed
ere
i
die
there
is
ink
and
parchment
in
yonder
little
that
s
a
good
thought
said
hugh
dick
fetch
the
tools
for
if
we
try
to
move
this
fellow
he
will
go
farther
than
we
can
follow
dick
went
and
returned
presently
with
an
a
roll
of
parchment
pens
and
a
little
table
then
hugh
sat
himself
down
on
the
altar
rail
placing
the
table
in
front
of
him
and
said
say
on
i
ll
write
since
you
can
not
now
nicholas
having
before
his
glazing
eyes
the
vision
of
imminent
judgment
briefly
but
clearly
told
all
the
truth
at
last
he
told
how
he
had
drugged
red
eve
giving
the
name
of
the
bane
which
he
mixed
in
the
milk
she
drank
he
told
how
when
her
mind
was
sleeping
though
her
body
was
awake
none
knowing
the
wickedness
that
had
been
wrought
save
he
and
acour
and
least
of
all
her
father
they
had
led
her
to
the
altar
like
a
lamb
to
the
slaughter
and
there
married
her
to
the
man
she
hated
he
told
how
although
he
had
fled
from
england
to
save
his
life
acour
had
never
ceased
to
desire
her
and
to
plot
to
get
her
into
his
power
any
more
than
he
had
ceased
to
fear
hugh
s
vengeance
for
this
reason
he
said
he
had
clad
himself
in
the
armour
of
another
knight
at
crecy
and
in
that
guise
accepted
mercy
at
hugh
s
hand
leaving
de
la
roche
to
die
in
his
place
beneath
that
same
hand
for
this
reason
also
he
had
commanded
him
nicholas
to
bring
about
the
death
of
hugh
de
cressi
and
his
squire
beneath
the
daggers
of
assassins
in
the
streets
of
venice
a
fate
from
which
they
had
been
saved
only
by
the
wizard
in
the
yellow
cap
whom
no
steel
could
harm
the
villain
hissed
dick
well
for
your
comfort
holy
priest
i
ll
tell
you
who
that
wizard
is
he
is
death
himself
death
the
sword
death
the
fire
death
the
helper
and
presently
you
ll
meet
him
i
knew
it
i
knew
it
groaned
the
wretched
man
oh
such
is
the
end
of
sin
whereof
we
think
so
little
in
our
day
of
nay
broke
in
hugh
you
ll
meet
not
the
minister
but
him
whom
he
serves
and
in
his
hand
are
mercies
be
silent
dick
for
this
wretch
makes
confession
and
his
time
is
short
spare
the
tool
and
save
your
wrath
for
him
who
wielded
it
go
now
and
fetch
david
day
that
he
may
witness
so
dick
went
and
nicholas
continued
his
tale
throwing
light
into
many
a
dark
place
though
there
was
little
more
that
hugh
thought
worthy
of
record
presently
david
came
and
started
back
in
horror
at
the
sight
of
that
yellow
tortured
face
set
upon
a
living
skeleton
then
the
writing
was
read
and
nicholas
held
up
by
dick
set
his
signature
with
a
trembling
hand
to
this
his
confession
of
the
truth
this
done
they
signed
as
witnesses
all
three
of
them
now
hugh
whose
pity
was
stirred
wished
to
move
nicholas
and
lay
him
on
a
bed
in
some
chamber
and
if
they
could
find
someone
to
watch
him
till
the
end
but
the
priest
refused
this
charity
let
me
die
before
the
altar
he
said
where
i
may
set
my
eyes
upon
him
whom
i
have
betrayed
afresh
and
he
pointed
to
the
carved
ivory
crucifix
which
hung
above
it
oh
be
warned
be
warned
my
brethren
he
went
on
in
a
wailing
voice
you
are
all
of
you
still
young
you
may
be
led
astray
as
i
was
by
the
desire
for
power
by
the
hope
of
wealth
you
may
sell
yourselves
to
the
wicked
as
i
did
i
who
once
was
good
and
strove
toward
the
right
if
satan
tempts
you
thus
then
remember
nicholas
the
priest
and
his
dreadful
death
and
see
how
he
pays
his
servants
the
plague
has
taken
others
yet
they
have
died
at
peace
but
i
i
die
in
hell
before
i
see
its
not
so
said
hugh
you
have
repented
and
i
against
whom
you
have
sinned
perhaps
more
than
all
forgive
you
as
i
am
sure
my
lady
would
could
she
then
it
is
more
than
i
do
muttered
grey
dick
to
himself
why
should
i
forgive
him
because
he
rots
alive
as
many
a
better
man
has
done
and
goes
to
reap
what
he
has
sown
who
if
he
had
won
his
way
would
have
sent
us
before
him
at
the
dagger
s
point
yet
who
knows
each
of
us
sins
in
his
own
fashion
and
perchance
sin
is
born
of
the
blood
and
not
of
the
will
if
ever
i
meet
murgh
again
i
ll
ask
him
but
perhaps
he
will
not
thus
reflected
dick
half
to
david
who
feared
and
did
not
understand
him
and
half
to
himself
ere
ever
he
had
finished
with
his
thoughts
which
were
not
such
as
sir
andrew
would
have
approved
father
nicholas
began
to
die
it
was
not
a
pleasant
sight
this
death
of
his
though
of
its
physical
part
nothing
shall
be
written
let
that
be
buried
with
other
records
of
the
great
plague
only
in
this
case
his
mind
triumphed
for
a
while
over
the
dissolution
of
his
body
when
there
was
little
left
of
him
save
bone
and
sinew
still
he
found
strength
to
cry
out
to
god
for
mercy
yes
and
to
raise
himself
and
cast
what
had
been
arms
about
the
ivory
rood
and
kiss
its
feet
with
what
had
been
lips
and
in
his
last
death
struggle
to
drag
it
down
and
pant
out
his
ultimate
breath
beneath
its
weight
so
there
they
left
him
a
horrible
huddled
heap
upon
which
gleamed
the
ivory
crucifix
and
went
their
way
gasping
into
the
air
chapter
xvi
at
avignon
hard
upon
two
months
had
gone
by
when
at
length
these
three
hugh
grey
dick
and
david
day
set
eyes
upon
the
towers
of
stately
avignon
standing
red
against
the
sunset
and
encircled
by
the
blue
waters
of
the
rhone
terrible
beyond
imagination
had
been
the
journey
of
these
men
who
followed
in
the
footsteps
of
murgh
they
saw
him
not
it
is
true
but
always
they
saw
his
handiwork
death
death
everywhere
death
nothing
but
death
one
night
they
supped
at
an
inn
with
the
host
his
family
and
servants
twelve
folk
in
all
in
seeming
health
when
they
rose
in
the
morning
one
old
woman
and
a
little
child
alone
remained
the
rest
were
dead
or
dying
one
day
they
were
surprised
and
taken
by
robbers
desperate
outcasts
of
the
mountains
who
gave
them
hours
to
make
their
peace
with
heaven
ere
they
hanged
them
because
they
had
slain
so
many
of
the
band
before
they
were
overpowered
but
when
those
hours
of
grace
had
elapsed
it
would
have
been
easy
for
them
to
hang
all
who
remained
of
those
robbers
themselves
so
they
took
the
best
of
their
horses
and
their
gold
and
rode
on
again
leaving
the
murderers
murdered
by
a
stronger
power
than
man
they
went
through
desolate
villages
where
the
crops
rotted
in
the
fields
they
went
through
stricken
towns
whereof
the
moan
and
the
stench
rose
in
a
foul
incense
to
heaven
they
crossed
rivers
where
the
very
fish
had
died
by
thousands
poisoned
of
the
dead
that
rolled
seaward
in
their
waters
the
pleasant
land
had
become
a
hell
and
untouched
unharmed
they
plodded
onward
through
those
deeps
of
hell
but
a
night
or
two
before
they
had
slept
in
a
city
whereof
the
population
or
those
who
remained
alive
of
them
seemed
to
have
gone
mad
in
one
place
they
danced
and
sang
and
made
love
in
an
open
square
in
another
bands
of
naked
creatures
marched
the
streets
singing
hymns
and
flogging
themselves
till
the
blood
ran
down
to
their
heels
while
the
prostrated
themselves
before
them
these
were
the
forerunners
of
the
mad
dancers
of
the
following
year
in
a
field
outside
of
this
city
they
came
upon
even
a
more
dreadful
sight
here
forty
or
fifty
frenzied
people
most
of
them
drunk
were
engaged
in
burning
a
poor
jew
his
wife
and
two
children
upon
a
great
fire
made
of
the
staves
of
which
they
had
plundered
from
some
neighbouring
cellars
when
hugh
and
his
companions
came
upon
the
scene
the
jew
had
already
burned
and
this
crowd
of
devils
were
preparing
to
cast
his
wife
and
children
into
the
flames
which
they
had
been
forced
to
see
devour
their
husband
and
father
indeed
with
yells
of
brutal
laughter
they
were
thrusting
the
children
into
two
great
casks
ere
they
rolled
them
into
the
heart
of
the
fire
while
the
wretched
mother
stood
by
and
shrieked
what
do
you
sirs
asked
hugh
riding
up
to
them
we
burn
wizards
and
their
spawn
sir
knight
answered
the
ringleader
know
that
these
accursed
jews
have
poisoned
the
wells
of
our
town
we
have
witnesses
who
saw
them
do
it
and
thus
brought
the
plague
upon
us
moreover
she
and
he
pointed
to
the
woman
was
seen
talking
not
fourteen
days
ago
to
the
devil
in
a
yellow
cap
who
appears
everywhere
before
the
death
begins
now
roll
them
in
roll
them
in
hugh
drew
his
sword
for
this
sight
was
more
than
his
english
flesh
and
blood
could
bear
dick
also
unsheathed
the
black
bow
while
young
david
produced
a
great
knife
which
he
carried
free
those
children
said
hugh
to
the
man
with
whom
he
had
spoken
a
fat
fellow
with
rolling
bloodshot
eyes
get
you
to
hell
stranger
he
answered
or
we
ll
throw
you
on
the
fire
also
as
a
jew
in
knight
s
free
those
children
said
hugh
again
in
a
terrible
voice
or
i
send
you
before
them
be
warned
i
speak
be
you
warned
stranger
for
i
speak
truth
also
replied
the
man
mimicking
him
now
friends
he
added
tuck
up
the
devil
s
brats
in
their
warm
they
were
his
last
words
for
hugh
thrust
with
his
sword
and
down
he
went
now
a
furious
clamour
arose
the
mob
snatched
up
burning
staves
bludgeons
knives
or
whatever
they
had
at
hand
and
prepared
to
kill
the
three
without
waiting
for
orders
dick
began
to
shoot
david
a
bold
young
man
rushed
at
one
of
the
most
violent
and
stabbed
him
and
hugh
who
had
leapt
from
his
horse
set
himself
back
to
back
with
the
other
two
thrice
dick
shot
and
at
the
third
deadly
arrow
these
drunken
fellows
grew
sober
enough
to
understand
that
they
wished
no
more
of
them
suddenly
acting
on
a
common
impulse
they
fled
away
every
one
only
leaving
behind
them
those
who
had
fallen
beneath
the
arrows
and
the
sword
but
some
who
were
so
full
of
wine
that
they
could
not
run
tumbled
headlong
and
lay
there
helpless
woman
said
hugh
when
they
had
departed
your
husband
is
lost
but
you
and
your
children
are
saved
now
go
your
ways
and
thank
whatever
god
you
worship
for
his
small
alas
sir
knight
the
poor
creature
a
still
young
and
not
unhandsome
jewess
wailed
in
answer
whither
shall
i
go
if
i
return
to
that
town
those
christian
men
will
surely
murder
me
and
my
children
as
they
have
already
murdered
my
husband
kill
us
now
by
the
sword
or
the
bow
it
will
be
a
kindness
but
leave
us
not
here
to
be
tortured
by
the
christian
men
according
to
their
fashion
with
us
poor
are
you
willing
to
go
to
avignon
asked
hugh
after
thinking
awhile
ay
sir
knight
or
anywhere
away
from
these
christians
indeed
at
avignon
i
have
a
brother
who
perchance
will
protect
then
mount
my
horse
said
hugh
dick
and
david
draw
those
two
youngsters
from
the
tubs
and
set
them
on
your
beasts
we
can
so
the
children
two
comely
little
girls
of
eight
and
six
years
of
age
or
thereabout
were
dragged
out
of
their
dreadful
prisons
and
lifted
to
the
saddle
the
wretched
widow
running
to
the
bonfire
snatched
from
it
her
husband
s
hand
and
hid
it
in
the
bosom
of
her
filthy
robe
then
she
took
some
of
the
white
ashes
and
threw
them
toward
that
city
muttering
curses
as
she
did
so
what
do
you
asked
hugh
curiously
i
pray
sir
to
jehovah
the
god
of
the
jews
that
for
every
grain
of
these
ashes
he
may
take
a
life
in
payment
for
that
of
my
murdered
husband
and
i
think
that
he
will
like
enough
answered
hugh
crossing
himself
but
woman
can
you
wonder
that
we
christians
hold
you
sorcerers
when
we
hear
such
prayers
from
your
lips
she
turned
with
a
tragic
motion
and
pointing
to
the
bones
of
her
husband
smouldering
in
the
fire
answered
and
can
you
wonder
sir
that
we
wretched
creatures
utter
such
prayers
when
you
our
masters
do
such
deeds
as
this
no
answered
hugh
i
can
not
let
us
be
going
from
this
so
they
went
a
melancholy
procession
if
ever
there
one
was
seen
upon
this
earth
as
the
three
englishmen
marched
behind
the
horses
with
their
weeping
burdens
grey
dick
reflected
aloud
after
his
fashion
jew
and
christian
he
said
the
jews
killed
one
man
who
chanced
to
be
a
god
though
they
knew
it
not
and
ever
since
the
christians
have
killed
thousands
of
the
jews
now
which
is
the
most
wicked
those
jews
who
killed
the
man
who
was
a
god
because
he
said
he
was
a
god
or
those
christians
who
throw
a
man
into
a
fire
to
burn
before
his
wife
s
and
children
s
eyes
a
man
who
never
said
that
he
was
a
god
but
who
they
said
put
poison
into
their
wells
which
he
did
not
do
but
which
they
believed
he
did
because
he
was
one
of
the
race
that
thirteen
hundred
years
ago
killed
their
god
ah
well
jew
and
christian
i
think
the
same
devil
dwells
in
them
all
but
murgh
alone
knows
the
truth
of
the
matter
if
ever
we
meet
again
i
ll
ask
him
of
it
meanwhile
we
go
to
avignon
in
strange
company
whereof
all
the
holy
priests
yonder
if
any
of
them
still
live
to
say
nothing
of
the
people
may
demand
an
account
of
so
spoke
dick
as
one
who
seeks
an
answer
but
neither
of
his
companions
gave
him
any
on
they
went
through
the
ruined
land
unpursued
although
they
had
just
brought
sundry
men
to
their
deaths
for
now
neither
law
nor
justice
was
left
and
those
killed
who
could
and
those
died
who
must
unwept
and
unavenged
only
certain
travellers
flying
they
knew
not
whither
flying
from
doom
to
doom
eyed
them
with
hate
and
loathing
because
of
their
companions
those
who
consorted
with
jews
must
they
thought
be
the
enemies
of
every
christian
soul
well
was
it
for
them
perhaps
that
the
early
winter
night
was
closing
in
when
they
reached
the
wonderful
bridge
of
bénézet
now
quite
unguarded
since
a
worse
foe
reigned
in
avignon
than
any
that
it
could
fear
from
without
they
crossed
it
unnoted
for
here
none
lingered
in
the
gloom
and
rain
save
one
poor
woman
who
called
out
to
them
that
all
she
loved
were
dead
and
that
she
went
to
seek
them
then
before
they
could
interfere
she
scrambled
to
the
parapet
of
the
bridge
and
with
a
wild
cry
leapt
into
the
foaming
waters
that
rushed
beneath
god
forgive
and
rest
her
muttered
hugh
crossing
himself
the
others
only
shrugged
their
shoulders
such
dreadful
sights
fed
their
eyes
daily
till
they
learned
to
take
little
note
of
them
in
a
deserted
place
on
the
farther
side
of
the
bridge
they
halted
and
hugh
said
to
the
jewish
widow
woman
here
is
avignon
where
you
tell
us
there
are
those
who
will
befriend
you
so
now
let
us
part
we
have
done
what
we
can
for
you
and
it
is
not
safe
either
for
you
or
for
us
that
we
should
be
seen
together
in
this
christian
sir
you
speak
well
she
answered
be
pleased
ere
we
separate
to
meet
no
more
perchance
to
tell
me
your
names
that
i
may
remember
them
and
hand
them
down
among
my
people
from
generation
to
so
he
told
her
and
thrust
onto
her
a
gift
of
money
and
the
most
of
such
food
as
remained
to
them
then
the
poor
woman
lifted
up
her
arms
and
said
i
rebecca
daughter
of
onias
and
wife
of
nathan
call
down
on
you
hugh
de
cressi
richard
archer
and
david
day
and
on
your
children
forever
the
blessings
of
jehovah
because
you
have
rescued
the
widow
and
her
children
from
the
fire
and
avenged
the
murder
of
the
husband
and
the
father
o
god
of
my
people
as
thou
didst
save
lot
and
his
house
from
the
flames
of
sodom
so
save
these
and
merciful
men
turn
from
them
the
sword
of
thy
wrath
when
it
smites
the
sinful
cities
cast
the
cloak
of
thy
protection
about
them
and
all
they
love
prosper
their
handiwork
in
peace
and
in
war
fulfil
their
desire
upon
their
enemies
and
at
last
let
them
die
full
of
years
and
honour
and
so
be
gathered
into
thy
eternal
bosom
thus
prayeth
rebecca
the
daughter
of
onias
and
thus
shall
it
then
leading
her
children
she
turned
and
vanished
into
the
darkness
now
said
dick
when
she
had
gone
although
they
were
spoken
by
a
jew
whom
men
call
accursed
because
their
forefathers
fulfilling
prophecy
or
some
few
of
them
wrought
a
great
crime
when
the
world
was
young
and
thereby
brought
about
the
salvation
of
mankind
as
we
believe
those
are
among
the
most
comfortable
words
to
which
my
ears
have
listened
especially
such
of
them
as
dealt
with
the
fulfilling
of
our
desire
upon
our
enemies
in
war
well
they
are
spoke
and
i
doubt
not
registered
in
a
book
which
will
not
be
lost
so
master
let
us
seek
a
lodging
in
this
city
of
avignon
which
for
my
part
i
do
with
a
light
hugh
nodded
and
his
heart
also
was
lightened
by
those
words
of
blessing
and
good
omen
mounting
their
horses
they
took
a
street
that
led
them
past
the
great
roches
des
doms
on
the
crest
of
which
stood
the
mighty
palace
of
the
popes
as
yet
unfinished
but
still
one
of
the
vastest
buildings
they
had
ever
seen
here
on
the
battlements
and
in
front
of
the
gateway
burned
great
fires
lit
by
order
of
his
holiness
to
purify
the
air
and
protect
him
and
his
court
from
the
plague
leaving
this
place
on
their
right
they
rode
slowly
along
one
of
the
principal
streets
of
the
town
seeking
an
inn
soon
they
found
one
a
large
place
that
had
a
sign
on
which
three
shepherds
were
painted
and
turned
to
enter
its
gateway
but
when
they
saw
them
out
of
that
gateway
rushed
a
mob
of
frantic
people
waving
swords
and
cudgels
and
saying
that
they
would
have
no
strangers
there
to
bring
the
death
among
them
let
us
go
on
said
hugh
for
here
it
seems
we
are
not
so
they
went
and
tried
three
other
inns
in
turn
at
two
of
them
they
met
with
a
like
greeting
but
the
doors
of
the
third
were
closed
and
the
place
was
deserted
then
for
a
crowd
began
to
gather
round
them
wearily
enough
they
turned
up
another
street
at
hazard
thus
they
wended
their
way
back
toward
the
great
central
rock
thinking
that
there
they
might
find
some
more
hospitable
tavern
following
this
new
street
they
reached
a
less
crowded
suburb
of
the
town
where
large
dwellings
stood
in
their
own
gardens
one
of
these
they
saw
by
the
flare
of
some
of
those
fires
which
burned
all
about
the
city
in
this
time
of
pestilence
seemed
to
be
a
small
castle
at
least
it
had
a
moat
round
it
and
a
drawbridge
which
was
down
seeing
that
lamps
burned
in
its
windows
hugh
who
was
worn
out
with
their
long
journeyings
took
a
sudden
resolution
doubtless
some
knight
dwells
in
this
fine
house
he
said
to
his
companions
let
us
go
up
and
declare
our
names
and
degree
and
by
virtue
of
them
claim
the
hospitality
which
is
our
be
it
so
grumbled
dick
we
can
not
be
worse
treated
there
than
we
were
at
the
inns
unless
the
owner
adds
arrows
to
the
swords
and
they
rode
across
the
drawbridge
to
the
gateway
of
the
little
castle
which
was
open
and
finding
no
one
there
through
a
small
courtyard
to
the
door
which
also
was
open
david
dismounted
and
knocked
on
it
but
none
answered
an
empty
house
belongs
to
no
one
said
dick
at
any
rate
in
these
times
let
us
they
did
so
and
saw
that
the
place
was
sumptuously
appointed
though
ancient
it
was
not
large
having
as
they
afterward
discovered
been
a
fortification
on
an
outer
wall
now
demolished
which
had
been
turned
to
the
purposes
of
a
dwelling
leaving
the
hall
out
of
which
opened
the
refectory
they
mounted
a
stone
stair
to
the
upper
chambers
and
entered
one
of
them
here
they
saw
a
strange
and
piteous
sight
on
a
bed
about
which
candles
still
burned
lay
a
young
woman
who
had
been
very
beautiful
arrayed
in
a
bride
s
robe
dead
of
the
plague
said
hugh
and
deserted
at
her
death
well
she
had
better
luck
than
many
since
she
was
not
left
to
die
alone
her
dress
and
these
candles
show
ay
answered
dick
but
fear
took
the
watchers
at
last
and
they
are
fled
well
we
will
fill
their
place
and
if
they
do
not
return
give
her
honourable
burial
in
her
own
courtyard
here
be
fine
lodgings
for
us
master
so
let
us
bide
in
them
until
the
rightful
owners
cast
us
out
come
david
and
help
me
raise
that
fine
lodgings
these
proved
to
be
indeed
since
as
they
found
no
house
in
avignon
was
better
furnished
with
all
things
needful
but
and
this
will
show
how
dreadful
were
the
times
during
these
days
that
they
made
this
their
home
they
never
so
much
as
learned
the
name
of
that
poor
lady
arrayed
in
the
bride
s
dress
and
laid
out
upon
her
marriage
bed
in
the
butteries
and
cellar
were
plentiful
provisions
of
food
having
eaten
of
it
with
thankfulness
they
chose
out
one
of
the
and
slept
there
quite
undisturbed
till
the
morning
sun
shone
in
at
the
and
awoke
them
then
they
arose
and
digging
a
shallow
grave
in
the
courtyard
with
some
garden
tools
which
they
found
in
a
shed
they
bore
out
the
poor
bride
and
removing
only
her
jewels
which
were
rich
enough
buried
her
there
in
her
wedding
dress
this
sad
duty
finished
they
washed
themselves
with
water
from
the
well
and
breakfasted
after
they
had
eaten
they
consulted
as
to
what
they
should
do
next
we
came
here
to
lay
a
certain
cause
before
his
holiness
said
hugh
let
us
go
up
to
the
palace
declare
our
business
and
estate
and
ask
so
leaving
david
in
charge
of
the
house
which
they
named
the
bride
s
tower
because
of
the
dead
lady
and
the
little
keep
which
rose
above
it
and
of
the
horses
that
they
had
stalled
in
the
stable
they
went
out
and
made
their
way
to
the
great
entrance
of
the
pope
s
palace
here
they
found
the
gates
shut
and
barred
with
a
huge
fire
burning
behind
them
still
they
knocked
until
some
guards
appeared
armed
with
and
asked
their
business
they
said
they
desired
to
see
his
holiness
or
at
least
one
of
his
secretaries
whereon
the
guards
asked
whence
they
came
they
replied
from
italy
and
were
told
that
if
so
they
would
find
no
entrance
there
since
the
death
had
come
from
italy
now
hugh
gave
his
name
and
stated
his
business
on
hearing
which
the
guards
laughed
at
him
annulment
of
a
false
marriage
said
their
captain
go
lay
your
petition
before
death
who
will
do
your
business
swiftly
if
he
has
not
done
it
already
get
you
gone
you
english
knight
with
your
squire
we
want
no
english
here
at
the
best
of
times
and
least
of
all
if
they
hail
from
come
on
master
said
dick
there
are
more
ways
into
a
house
than
by
the
front
door
and
we
won
t
want
to
leave
our
brains
to
grease
its
so
they
went
away
wondering
whither
they
should
betake
themselves
or
what
they
could
do
next
as
it
chanced
they
had
not
long
to
wait
for
an
answer
presently
a
notary
in
a
frayed
russet
gown
who
must
have
been
watching
their
movements
approached
them
and
asked
them
what
had
been
their
business
at
the
pope
s
palace
hugh
told
him
whereon
the
lawyer
finding
that
he
was
a
person
of
high
degree
became
deferential
in
his
manner
moreover
he
announced
that
he
was
a
notary
named
basil
of
tours
and
one
of
the
legal
secretaries
of
his
holiness
who
just
now
was
living
without
the
gates
of
the
palace
by
express
command
in
order
to
attend
to
the
affairs
of
suitors
at
the
papal
court
during
the
great
sickness
he
added
however
that
he
was
able
to
communicate
with
those
within
and
that
doubtless
it
might
be
in
his
power
to
forward
the
cause
of
the
noble
knight
sir
hugh
de
cressi
in
which
already
he
took
much
interest
there
would
be
a
fee
suggested
dick
looking
at
the
man
coldly
basil
answered
with
a
smirk
that
fees
and
legal
affairs
were
inseparable
the
latter
naturally
involved
the
former
not
that
he
cared
for
money
he
remarked
especially
in
this
time
of
general
woe
still
it
would
never
do
for
a
lawyer
however
humble
to
create
a
precedent
which
might
be
used
against
his
craft
in
better
days
then
he
named
a
sum
hugh
handed
him
double
what
he
asked
whereon
he
began
to
manifest
great
zeal
in
his
case
indeed
he
accompanied
them
to
the
fortified
house
that
they
had
named
the
bride
s
tower
which
he
alleged
with
or
without
truth
he
had
never
seen
before
there
he
wrote
down
all
particulars
of
the
suit
sir
edmund
acour
count
de
noyon
seigneur
of
cattrina
he
said
presently
why
i
think
that
a
lord
of
those
names
had
audience
with
his
holiness
some
while
ago
just
before
the
pest
grew
bad
in
avignon
and
the
gates
of
the
palace
were
ordered
to
be
shut
i
know
not
what
passed
on
the
occasion
not
having
been
retained
in
the
cause
but
i
will
find
out
and
tell
you
find
out
also
if
it
pleases
you
learned
basil
said
hugh
whether
or
no
this
knight
with
the
three
names
is
still
in
avignon
if
so
i
have
a
word
or
two
to
say
to
i
will
i
will
answered
the
notary
yet
i
think
it
most
unlikely
that
any
one
who
can
buy
or
beg
a
horse
to
ride
away
on
should
stay
in
this
old
city
just
now
unless
indeed
the
laws
of
his
order
bind
him
to
do
so
that
he
may
minister
to
the
afflicted
well
if
the
pest
spares
me
and
you
morning
i
will
be
back
here
at
this
hour
to
tell
you
all
that
i
can
how
did
this
sickness
begin
in
avignon
asked
grey
dick
noble
squire
none
know
for
certain
in
the
autumn
we
had
great
rains
heavy
mists
and
other
things
contrary
to
the
usual
course
of
nature
such
as
strange
lights
shining
in
the
heavens
and
so
forth
then
after
a
day
of
much
heat
one
evening
a
man
clad
in
a
red
and
yellow
cap
who
wore
a
cloak
of
thick
black
furs
and
necklaces
of
black
pearls
was
seen
standing
in
the
indeed
i
saw
him
myself
there
was
something
so
strange
and
dreadful
about
the
appearance
of
this
man
although
it
is
true
that
some
say
he
was
no
more
than
a
common
mountebank
arrayed
thus
to
win
pence
that
the
people
set
upon
him
they
hurled
stones
at
him
they
attacked
him
with
swords
and
every
other
weapon
and
thought
that
they
had
killed
him
when
suddenly
he
appeared
outside
the
throng
unhurt
then
he
stretched
out
his
hand
toward
them
and
melted
into
the
gloom
only
added
basil
nervously
it
was
noted
afterward
that
all
those
who
had
tried
to
injure
the
man
were
among
the
first
to
die
of
the
pest
thank
god
i
was
not
one
of
them
indeed
i
did
my
best
to
hold
them
back
which
perhaps
is
the
reason
why
i
am
alive
a
strange
story
said
hugh
though
i
have
heard
something
like
it
in
other
cities
through
which
we
have
passed
well
till
at
this
hour
friend
we
have
learned
two
things
master
said
dick
when
the
lawyer
had
bowed
himself
out
first
that
acour
is
or
has
been
in
avignon
and
secondly
that
murgh
the
messenger
murgh
the
sword
has
been
or
is
in
avignon
let
us
go
seek
for
one
of
the
other
of
them
since
for
my
part
i
desire
to
meet
them
so
all
that
day
they
sought
but
found
neither
next
morning
basil
reappeared
according
to
his
promise
and
informed
them
that
their
business
was
on
foot
also
he
said
that
it
was
likely
to
prove
more
difficult
than
he
anticipated
indeed
he
understood
that
he
who
was
named
de
noyon
and
cattrina
having
friends
among
the
cardinals
had
already
obtained
some
provisional
ratification
of
his
marriage
with
the
lady
eve
clavering
this
ratification
it
would
now
be
costly
and
difficult
to
set
aside
hugh
answered
that
if
only
he
could
be
granted
an
audience
with
his
holiness
he
had
evidence
which
would
make
the
justice
of
his
cause
plain
what
he
sought
was
an
audience
the
notary
scratched
his
lantern
jaws
and
asked
how
that
could
be
brought
about
when
every
gate
of
the
palace
was
shut
because
of
the
plague
still
perhaps
it
might
be
managed
he
added
if
a
certain
sum
were
forthcoming
to
bribe
various
janitors
and
persons
in
authority
hugh
gave
him
the
sum
out
of
the
store
of
gold
they
had
taken
from
the
robbers
in
the
mountains
with
something
over
for
himself
so
basil
departed
saying
that
he
would
return
at
the
same
hour
on
the
morrow
if
the
plague
spared
him
and
them
his
patrons
as
he
prayed
the
saints
that
it
might
do
hugh
watched
him
go
then
turned
to
dick
and
said
i
mistrust
me
of
that
hungry
wolf
in
sheep
s
clothing
who
talks
so
large
and
yet
does
nothing
let
us
go
out
and
search
avignon
again
perchance
we
may
meet
acour
or
at
least
gather
some
tidings
of
so
they
went
leaving
the
tower
locked
and
barred
who
perchance
would
have
been
wiser
to
follow
basil
a
debased
and
fraudulent
lawyer
of
no
character
at
all
this
man
lived
upon
such
fees
as
he
could
wring
without
authority
from
those
who
came
to
lay
their
suits
before
the
papal
court
playing
upon
their
hopes
and
fears
and
pretending
to
a
power
which
he
did
not
possess
had
they
done
so
they
might
have
seen
him
turn
up
a
certain
side
street
and
when
he
was
sure
that
none
watched
him
slip
into
the
portal
of
an
ancient
house
where
visitors
of
rank
were
accustomed
to
lodge
mounting
some
stairs
without
meeting
any
one
for
this
house
like
many
others
seemed
to
be
deserted
in
that
time
of
pestilence
he
knocked
upon
a
door
begone
whoever
you
are
growled
a
voice
from
within
here
there
are
neither
sick
to
be
tended
nor
dead
to
be
borne
had
they
been
there
to
hear
it
hugh
and
dick
might
have
found
that
voice
familiar
noble
lord
he
replied
i
am
the
notary
basil
and
come
upon
your
maybe
said
the
voice
but
how
know
i
that
you
have
not
been
near
some
case
of
foul
sickness
and
will
not
bring
it
here
have
no
fear
lord
i
have
been
waiting
on
the
healthy
not
on
the
sick
a
task
which
i
leave
to
others
who
have
more
taste
that
then
the
door
was
opened
cautiously
and
from
the
room
beyond
it
came
a
pungent
odour
of
aromatic
essences
basil
passed
in
shutting
it
quickly
behind
him
before
him
at
the
further
side
of
the
table
and
near
to
a
blazing
fire
stood
acour
himself
he
was
clothed
in
a
long
robe
and
held
a
piece
of
linen
that
was
soaked
in
some
substance
before
his
nose
and
mouth
nay
come
no
nearer
he
said
to
the
clerk
for
this
infection
is
most
subtle
and
be
so
good
as
to
cast
off
that
filthy
cloak
of
yours
and
leave
it
by
the
basil
obeyed
revealing
an
undergarment
that
was
still
more
foul
he
was
not
one
who
wasted
money
on
new
apparel
well
man
said
acour
surveying
him
with
evident
disgust
and
throwing
a
handful
of
dried
herbs
upon
the
fire
what
news
now
has
my
cause
been
laid
before
his
holiness
i
trust
so
for
know
that
i
grow
weary
of
being
cooped
up
here
like
a
falcon
in
a
cage
with
the
dread
of
a
loathsome
death
and
a
handful
of
frightened
servants
as
companions
who
do
nothing
but
drone
out
prayers
all
day
yes
lord
it
has
i
have
it
straight
from
clement
s
own
secretary
and
the
answer
is
that
his
holiness
will
attend
to
the
matter
when
the
pest
has
passed
away
from
avignon
and
not
before
he
adds
also
that
when
it
does
so
if
ever
all
the
parties
to
the
cause
by
themselves
or
by
their
representatives
must
appear
before
him
he
will
give
no
judgment
upon
an
issue
which
from
letters
that
have
reached
him
appears
to
be
complicated
and
mother
of
heaven
exclaimed
acour
what
a
fool
am
i
to
let
you
in
to
tell
me
such
tidings
well
if
that
is
all
you
have
to
say
the
sooner
i
am
out
of
this
hateful
city
the
better
i
ride
this
afternoon
or
if
need
be
walk
on
indeed
said
basil
then
you
leave
behind
you
some
who
are
not
so
frightened
of
their
health
but
who
bide
here
upon
a
very
similar
errand
doubtless
as
often
happens
to
the
bold
they
will
find
a
way
to
fulfil
and
who
may
these
be
fellow
a
bold
and
warlike
knight
a
squire
with
hair
like
tow
and
a
face
that
might
be
worn
by
death
himself
and
a
young
english
serving
acour
started
up
from
the
chair
in
which
he
had
sat
down
no
need
to
tell
me
their
names
he
said
but
how
by
hell
s
gate
came
de
cressi
and
his
familiar
by
the
road
i
imagine
lord
like
others
at
least
a
few
days
ago
they
were
seen
travelling
toward
the
bridge
of
bénézet
in
the
company
of
certain
jews
whom
i
am
informed
they
had
rescued
from
the
just
reward
of
their
witchcraft
i
have
a
note
of
all
the
facts
which
include
the
slaying
of
sundry
good
christians
on
behalf
of
the
said
jews
why
that
is
enough
to
hang
them
in
these
times
but
what
do
they
here
and
where
do
they
lodge
like
your
lordship
they
strive
to
see
the
pope
they
desire
that
an
alleged
marriage
between
one
sir
edmund
acour
count
of
noyon
and
seigneur
of
cattrina
and
one
lady
eve
clavering
an
englishwoman
may
be
declared
null
and
void
as
they
have
been
so
good
as
to
honour
me
with
their
confidence
and
appoint
me
their
agent
i
am
able
to
detail
the
facts
therefore
i
will
tell
you
at
once
that
the
case
of
this
knight
de
cressi
appears
to
be
excellent
since
it
includes
the
written
confession
of
a
certain
father
nicholas
of
whom
perhaps
you
have
the
written
confession
of
nicholas
have
you
seen
it
not
as
yet
so
far
i
have
been
trusted
with
no
original
documents
is
it
your
will
that
i
should
try
to
possess
myself
of
these
because
if
so
i
will
do
my
best
provided
and
he
looked
at
the
pocket
of
acour
s
robe
how
much
asked
acour
the
man
named
a
great
sum
half
to
be
paid
down
and
half
on
the
delivery
of
the
papers
i
ll
double
it
said
acour
if
you
can
bring
it
about
that
these
insolent
englishmen
die
of
the
how
can
i
do
that
lord
asked
basil
with
a
sour
smile
such
tricks
might
work
backward
i
might
die
or
you
still
these
men
have
committed
crimes
and
just
now
there
is
a
prejudice
against
ay
said
acour
the
englishmen
are
sorcerers
i
tell
you
that
in
venice
they
were
seen
in
the
company
of
that
fiend
of
the
yellow
cap
and
the
fur
robe
who
appears
everywhere
before
the
prove
it
exclaimed
basil
and
the
citizens
of
avignon
will
rid
you
of
their
then
they
debated
long
together
and
the
end
of
it
was
that
basil
departed
saying
that
he
would
return
again
on
the
morrow
and
make
report
as
to
certain
matters
chapter
xvii
a
meeting
hugh
grey
dick
and
david
trudged
up
and
down
through
the
streets
of
avignon
all
that
long
day
they
trudged
seeking
news
and
finding
little
again
and
again
they
asked
at
the
inns
whether
a
knight
who
bore
the
name
of
acour
or
de
noyon
or
cattrina
was
or
had
been
a
guest
there
but
none
whom
they
asked
seemed
to
know
anything
of
such
a
person
they
asked
it
of
citizens
also
of
holy
priests
good
men
who
careless
of
their
own
lives
followed
biers
or
cartloads
of
dead
destined
to
the
plague
pit
or
the
river
that
they
might
pronounce
over
them
the
last
blessings
of
the
church
they
asked
it
of
physicians
some
few
of
whom
still
remained
alive
as
they
hurried
from
house
to
house
to
administer
to
the
sick
or
dying
but
all
of
these
either
did
not
answer
at
all
or
else
shrugged
their
shoulders
and
went
on
their
melancholy
business
only
one
of
them
called
back
that
he
had
no
time
to
waste
in
replying
to
foolish
questions
and
that
probably
the
knight
they
sought
was
dead
long
ago
or
had
fled
from
the
city
another
man
an
officer
of
customs
who
seemed
half
dazed
with
misery
and
fear
said
that
he
remembered
the
lord
cattrina
entering
avignon
with
a
good
many
followers
since
he
himself
had
levied
the
customary
tolls
on
his
company
as
for
how
long
it
was
ago
he
could
not
say
since
his
recollection
failed
him
so
much
had
happened
since
so
he
bade
them
farewell
until
they
met
in
heaven
which
he
added
doubtless
would
be
soon
the
evening
drew
on
wearily
enough
they
had
trudged
round
the
great
roche
des
doms
looking
up
at
the
huge
palace
of
the
pope
where
the
fires
burned
night
and
day
and
the
guards
watched
at
the
shut
gates
that
forbidden
palace
into
which
no
man
might
enter
leaving
it
they
struck
down
a
street
that
was
new
to
them
which
led
toward
their
borrowed
dwelling
of
the
bride
s
tower
this
street
was
very
empty
save
for
a
few
miserable
creatures
some
of
whom
lay
dead
or
dying
in
the
gutters
others
lurked
about
in
doorways
or
behind
the
pillars
of
gates
probably
for
no
good
purpose
they
heard
the
footsteps
of
a
man
following
them
who
seemed
to
keep
in
the
shadow
but
took
no
heed
since
they
set
him
down
as
some
wretched
thief
who
would
never
dare
to
attack
three
armed
men
it
did
not
occur
to
them
that
this
was
none
other
than
the
notary
basil
clad
in
a
new
robe
who
for
purposes
of
his
own
was
spying
upon
their
movements
they
came
to
a
large
house
of
which
the
gateway
attracted
grey
dick
s
sharp
eyes
what
does
that
entrance
remind
you
of
master
he
asked
hugh
looked
at
it
carelessly
and
answered
why
of
the
preceptory
at
dunwich
see
there
are
the
same
arms
upon
the
stone
shield
doubtless
once
the
knights
templar
dwelt
there
sir
andrew
may
have
visited
this
place
in
his
as
the
words
left
his
lips
two
men
came
out
of
the
gateway
one
of
them
a
physician
to
judge
by
the
robe
and
the
case
of
medicines
which
he
carried
the
other
a
very
tall
person
wrapped
in
a
long
cloak
the
physician
was
speaking
she
may
live
or
she
may
die
he
said
she
seems
strong
the
pest
you
say
has
been
on
her
for
four
days
which
is
longer
than
most
endure
it
she
has
no
swellings
and
has
not
bled
from
the
lungs
though
on
the
other
hand
she
is
now
insensible
which
often
precedes
the
end
i
can
say
no
more
it
is
in
the
hands
of
god
yes
i
will
ask
you
to
pay
me
the
fee
now
who
knows
if
you
will
be
alive
to
do
so
if
she
dies
before
then
i
recommend
you
to
throw
her
into
the
river
which
the
pope
has
blessed
it
is
cleaner
burial
than
the
plague
pit
i
presume
she
is
your
a
beautiful
woman
pity
she
should
be
wasted
thus
but
many
others
are
in
a
like
case
if
she
awakes
give
her
good
food
and
if
you
can
not
get
that
wine
of
which
there
is
plenty
five
gold
pieces
thank
you
and
he
hurried
away
little
have
you
told
me
physician
that
i
did
not
know
already
said
the
tall
hooded
figure
in
a
deep
voice
the
sound
of
which
thrilled
hugh
to
his
marrow
yet
you
are
right
it
is
in
the
hands
of
god
and
to
those
hands
i
trust
not
in
vain
i
sir
said
hugh
addressing
him
out
of
the
shadow
in
which
he
stood
be
pleased
to
tell
me
if
you
will
whether
you
have
met
in
this
town
a
knight
of
the
name
of
sir
edmund
acour
for
of
him
i
am
in
search
sir
edmund
acour
answered
the
figure
no
i
have
not
met
him
in
avignon
though
it
is
like
enough
that
he
is
here
yet
i
have
known
of
this
knight
far
away
in
was
it
at
blythburgh
in
suffolk
perchance
asked
hugh
ay
at
blythburgh
in
suffolk
but
who
are
you
that
speak
in
english
and
know
of
blythburgh
in
suffolk
oh
cried
hugh
what
do
you
here
sir
andrew
arnold
the
old
man
threw
back
his
hood
and
stared
at
him
hugh
de
cressi
by
christ
s
holy
name
he
exclaimed
yes
and
richard
the
archer
also
the
light
is
bad
i
did
not
see
your
faces
welcome
hugh
thrice
welcome
and
he
threw
his
arms
about
him
and
embraced
him
come
enter
my
lodgings
i
have
much
to
say
to
one
thing
i
desire
to
learn
most
of
all
father
the
rest
can
wait
who
is
the
sick
lady
of
whom
you
spoke
to
yonder
physician
she
that
he
thought
was
your
who
could
it
be
hugh
except
eve
eve
gasped
hugh
eve
dying
of
the
pest
nay
son
who
said
so
she
is
ill
not
dying
who
i
believe
will
live
for
many
you
believe
father
you
believe
why
this
foul
plague
scarce
spares
one
in
ten
oh
why
do
you
believe
god
teaches
me
to
do
so
answered
the
old
knight
solemnly
i
only
sent
for
that
physician
because
he
has
medicines
which
i
lack
but
it
is
not
in
him
and
his
drugs
that
i
put
my
trust
come
let
us
go
in
and
see
so
they
went
up
the
stairs
and
turned
down
a
long
passage
into
which
the
light
flowed
dimly
through
large
open
casements
who
is
that
asked
hugh
suddenly
i
thought
that
one
brushed
past
me
though
i
could
see
ay
broke
in
the
lad
david
who
was
following
and
i
felt
a
cold
wind
as
though
some
one
stirred
the
grey
dick
also
opened
his
lips
to
speak
then
changed
his
mind
and
was
silent
but
sir
andrew
said
impatiently
i
saw
no
one
therefore
there
was
no
one
to
see
enter
and
he
opened
the
door
now
they
found
themselves
in
a
lighted
room
beyond
which
lay
another
room
bide
you
here
richard
with
your
companion
said
sir
andrew
hugh
follow
me
and
let
us
learn
whether
i
have
trusted
to
god
in
then
very
gently
he
opened
the
door
and
they
passed
in
together
closing
it
behind
them
this
is
what
hugh
saw
at
the
far
end
of
the
room
was
a
bed
near
to
which
stood
a
lamp
that
showed
sitting
up
in
the
bed
a
beautiful
young
woman
whose
dark
hair
fell
all
about
her
her
face
was
flushed
but
not
wasted
or
made
dreadful
by
the
sickness
as
happened
to
so
many
there
she
sat
staring
before
her
with
her
large
dark
eyes
and
a
smile
upon
her
sweet
lips
like
one
that
muses
on
happy
things
see
whispered
sir
andrew
she
is
awakened
from
her
swoon
i
think
i
did
not
trust
in
vain
my
she
caught
the
tones
of
his
voice
and
spoke
is
that
you
father
she
asked
dreamily
draw
near
for
i
have
such
a
strange
story
to
tell
he
obeyed
leaving
hugh
in
the
shadow
and
she
went
on
just
now
i
awoke
from
my
sleep
and
saw
a
man
standing
by
my
yes
yes
sir
andrew
said
the
physician
whom
i
sent
for
to
see
do
physicians
in
avignon
wear
caps
of
red
and
yellow
and
robes
of
black
fur
and
strings
of
great
black
pearls
that
to
tell
truth
i
coveted
sorely
she
asked
laughing
a
little
no
no
if
this
were
a
physician
he
is
of
the
sort
that
heals
souls
indeed
now
that
i
think
of
it
when
i
asked
him
his
name
and
business
he
answered
that
the
first
was
the
helper
and
the
second
to
bring
peace
to
those
in
well
daughter
and
what
else
did
the
man
say
asked
sir
andrew
soothingly
you
think
i
wander
she
said
interpreting
the
tone
of
his
voice
and
not
his
words
but
indeed
it
is
not
so
well
he
said
little
only
that
i
had
been
very
ill
near
to
death
in
truth
much
nearer
than
i
thought
but
that
now
i
should
recover
and
within
a
day
or
two
be
quite
well
and
strong
again
i
asked
him
why
he
had
come
to
tell
me
this
he
replied
because
he
thought
that
i
should
like
to
know
that
he
had
met
one
whom
i
loved
in
the
city
of
venice
in
italy
one
who
was
named
hugh
de
cressi
yes
father
he
said
hugh
de
cressi
who
with
his
squire
an
archer
had
befriended
him
there
and
that
this
hugh
was
well
and
would
remain
so
and
that
soon
i
should
see
him
again
also
he
added
that
he
had
met
one
whom
i
hated
who
was
named
the
lord
of
cattrina
and
that
if
this
cattrina
threatened
me
i
should
do
wisely
to
fly
back
to
england
since
there
i
should
find
peace
and
safety
then
suddenly
just
before
you
came
in
he
was
you
have
strange
dreams
eve
said
sir
andrew
yet
there
is
truth
in
their
madness
now
be
strong
lest
joy
should
kill
you
as
it
has
done
by
many
a
one
then
he
turned
to
the
shadow
behind
him
and
said
next
instant
hugh
was
kneeling
at
eve
s
bedside
and
pressing
his
lips
upon
her
hand
oh
they
had
much
to
say
to
each
other
so
much
that
the
half
of
it
remained
unsaid
still
hugh
learned
that
she
and
sir
andrew
had
come
to
avignon
upon
the
pope
s
summons
to
lay
this
matter
of
her
alleged
marriage
before
him
in
person
when
they
reached
the
town
they
found
it
already
in
the
grip
of
the
great
plague
and
that
to
see
his
holiness
was
almost
impossible
since
he
had
shut
himself
up
in
his
palace
and
would
admit
no
one
yet
an
interview
was
promised
through
sir
andrew
s
friends
only
then
the
sickness
struck
eve
and
she
could
not
go
nor
was
sir
andrew
allowed
to
do
so
since
he
was
nursing
one
who
lay
then
hugh
began
to
tell
his
tale
to
which
eve
and
sir
andrew
arnold
listened
greedily
of
murgh
for
sundry
reasons
he
said
nothing
and
of
the
fight
from
which
acour
had
fled
in
venice
before
the
earthquake
but
little
he
told
them
however
that
he
had
heard
that
this
acour
had
been
or
was
in
avignon
and
that
he
had
learned
from
a
notary
named
basil
whom
he
hugh
had
retained
that
acour
had
won
from
the
pope
a
confirmation
of
his
marriage
a
lie
interrupted
sir
andrew
his
holiness
caused
me
to
be
informed
expressly
that
he
would
give
no
decision
in
this
cause
until
all
the
case
was
before
as
he
said
the
words
a
disturbance
arose
in
the
outer
room
and
the
harsh
voice
of
grey
dick
was
heard
saying
back
you
dog
would
you
thrust
yourself
into
the
chamber
of
the
lady
of
clavering
back
or
i
will
cast
you
through
the
sir
andrew
went
to
see
what
was
the
matter
and
hugh
breaking
off
his
tale
followed
him
to
find
the
notary
basil
on
his
knees
with
grey
dick
gripping
him
by
the
collar
of
his
robe
sir
knight
said
basil
recognizing
hugh
should
i
your
faithful
agent
be
treated
thus
by
this
squire
of
yours
that
depends
on
what
you
have
done
sir
lawyer
answered
hugh
motioning
to
dick
to
loose
the
man
all
i
have
done
sir
knight
is
to
follow
you
into
a
house
where
i
chanced
to
see
you
enter
in
order
to
give
you
some
good
tidings
then
this
fellow
caught
me
by
the
throat
and
said
that
if
i
dared
to
break
in
upon
the
privacy
of
one
whom
he
called
red
eve
and
lady
clavering
he
would
kill
he
had
his
orders
then
sir
knight
he
might
have
executed
them
less
roughly
had
he
but
told
me
that
you
were
alone
with
some
lady
i
should
have
understand
and
withdrawn
for
a
while
although
to
do
so
would
have
been
to
let
precious
moments
slip
and
the
knave
leered
horribly
cease
your
foul
talk
and
state
your
business
interrupted
sir
andrew
thrusting
himself
in
front
of
hugh
who
he
feared
would
strike
the
fellow
and
pray
who
may
you
be
asked
the
lawyer
glancing
up
at
the
tall
figure
that
towered
above
him
sir
andrew
threw
back
his
hood
revealing
his
aged
countenance
his
dark
and
flashing
eyes
and
his
hair
and
beard
if
you
would
learn
man
he
said
in
his
great
voice
in
the
world
i
was
known
as
sir
andrew
arnold
one
of
the
priors
of
the
order
of
the
templars
which
is
a
name
that
you
may
have
heard
but
now
that
i
have
laid
aside
all
worldly
pomp
and
greatness
i
am
but
father
andrew
of
dunwich
in
yes
yes
i
have
heard
the
name
who
has
not
said
the
lawyer
humbly
also
you
are
here
as
guardian
to
the
lady
eve
clavering
are
you
not
to
lay
a
certain
cause
before
his
holiness
oh
do
not
start
all
these
matters
came
to
my
knowledge
who
am
concerned
in
every
great
business
in
avignon
as
the
chief
agent
and
procurator
of
the
papal
court
though
it
is
true
that
this
tiding
has
reached
me
only
within
the
last
few
minutes
and
from
the
lips
of
your
own
people
holy
father
i
pray
your
pardon
for
breaking
in
upon
you
which
i
did
only
because
the
matter
is
very
pressing
sir
hugh
de
cressi
here
has
a
cause
to
lay
before
the
pope
with
which
you
may
be
acquainted
well
for
two
days
i
have
striven
to
win
him
an
audience
and
now
through
my
sole
influence
behold
tis
granted
see
here
and
he
produced
a
parchment
that
purported
to
be
signed
by
the
pope
s
secretary
and
countersigned
by
a
cardinal
and
read
if
the
english
knight
sir
hugh
de
cressi
and
his
squire
the
captain
richard
will
be
in
the
chamber
of
audience
at
the
palace
at
seven
of
the
clock
this
evening
that
is
within
something
less
than
half
an
hour
his
holiness
will
be
pleased
to
receive
them
as
a
most
special
boon
having
learned
that
the
said
sir
hugh
is
a
knight
much
in
favour
with
his
grace
of
england
who
appointed
him
his
champion
in
a
combat
that
was
lately
to
be
fought
at
that
s
true
enough
though
i
know
not
how
the
pope
heard
of
it
interrupted
hugh
through
me
sir
knight
for
i
learn
everything
none
have
so
much
power
in
avignon
as
i
although
it
often
pleases
me
to
seem
poor
and
of
no
account
but
let
that
pass
either
you
must
take
this
opportunity
or
be
content
not
to
see
his
holiness
at
all
orders
have
been
issued
because
of
the
increase
of
this
pest
in
avignon
that
from
forward
none
shall
be
admitted
to
the
palace
upon
any
pretext
whatsoever
no
not
even
a
then
i
had
best
go
said
hugh
ay
answered
sir
andrew
and
return
here
with
your
tidings
as
soon
as
may
be
yet
he
added
in
a
low
voice
to
grey
dick
i
love
not
the
look
of
this
scurvy
guide
of
yours
could
not
your
master
have
found
a
better
attorney
perhaps
answered
dick
that
is
if
one
is
left
alive
in
avignon
being
in
haste
we
took
the
first
that
came
to
hand
and
it
seems
that
he
will
serve
our
turn
at
least
if
he
plays
tricks
i
promise
it
will
be
the
worse
for
him
and
he
looked
grimly
at
the
rogue
who
was
talking
to
david
day
and
appeared
to
hear
nothing
so
they
went
and
with
them
david
who
had
witnessed
the
confession
of
father
nicholas
therefore
they
thought
it
best
that
he
should
accompany
them
to
testify
to
it
if
there
were
need
bid
my
lady
keep
a
good
heart
and
say
that
i
will
be
with
her
again
ere
long
said
hugh
as
they
descended
the
stairs
in
haste
following
the
guidance
of
basil
they
turned
first
this
way
and
then
that
till
soon
in
the
gathering
darkness
they
knew
not
where
they
were
what
was
the
name
of
the
street
in
which
sir
andrew
had
his
lodging
asked
hugh
halting
rue
benezet
answered
basil
forward
we
have
no
time
to
did
you
tell
sir
andrew
where
we
dwelt
master
said
dick
presently
for
i
did
by
my
faith
dick
no
it
slipped
my
then
it
will
be
hard
for
him
to
find
us
if
he
has
need
master
in
this
rabbit
warren
of
a
town
still
that
can
t
be
mended
now
i
wish
we
were
clear
of
this
business
for
it
seems
to
me
that
yon
fellow
is
not
leading
us
toward
the
palace
almost
am
i
minded
and
he
looked
at
basil
then
checked
himself
presently
dick
wished
it
still
more
taking
yet
another
turn
they
found
themselves
in
an
open
square
or
garden
that
was
surrounded
by
many
mean
houses
in
this
square
great
burned
lighting
it
luridly
by
the
flare
of
them
they
saw
that
hundreds
of
people
were
gathered
there
listening
to
a
friar
who
was
preaching
to
them
from
the
top
of
a
as
they
drew
near
to
the
crowd
through
which
basil
was
leading
them
hugh
heard
the
friar
shouting
men
of
avignon
this
pest
which
kills
us
is
the
work
not
of
god
but
of
the
jew
blasphemers
and
of
the
sorcerers
who
are
in
league
with
them
i
tell
you
that
two
such
sorcerers
who
pass
as
englishmen
are
in
your
city
now
and
have
been
consorting
with
the
jews
plotting
your
destruction
one
looks
like
a
young
knight
but
the
other
has
the
face
of
death
himself
and
both
of
them
wrought
murders
in
a
neighbouring
town
to
protect
the
jews
until
you
kill
the
accursed
jews
this
plague
will
never
pass
you
will
die
every
one
of
you
with
your
wives
and
children
if
you
do
not
kill
the
jews
and
their
just
then
the
man
rolling
his
wild
eyes
about
caught
sight
of
hugh
and
dick
see
he
screamed
there
are
the
wizards
who
in
venice
were
seen
in
the
company
of
the
enemy
of
mankind
that
good
christian
basil
has
brought
them
face
to
face
with
you
as
he
promised
me
that
he
as
he
heard
these
words
hugh
drew
his
sword
and
leapt
at
basil
but
the
rogue
was
watching
with
a
yell
of
fear
he
threw
himself
among
the
crowd
and
there
vanished
out
weapons
and
back
to
back
cried
hugh
for
we
are
so
the
three
of
them
ranged
themselves
together
facing
outward
in
front
of
them
gleamed
grey
dick
s
axe
hugh
s
sword
and
david
s
great
knife
in
a
moment
the
furious
mob
was
surging
round
them
like
the
sea
howling
down
with
the
foreign
wizards
kill
the
friends
of
the
jews
one
solid
wall
of
changing
white
faces
a
man
struck
at
them
with
a
halbert
but
the
blow
fell
short
for
he
was
afraid
to
come
too
near
grey
dick
leapt
forward
and
in
a
moment
was
back
again
leaving
that
man
dead
smitten
through
from
skull
to
chin
for
a
while
there
was
silence
since
this
sudden
death
gave
them
pause
and
in
it
hugh
cried
out
are
blameless
men
to
be
murdered
thus
have
we
no
friends
in
avignon
some
answered
a
voice
from
the
outer
shadow
though
who
spoke
they
could
not
see
save
the
protectors
of
the
jews
cried
the
voice
again
then
came
a
rush
and
a
fighting
began
around
them
in
which
they
took
no
share
when
it
had
passed
over
them
like
a
gust
of
wind
david
day
was
gone
killed
or
trodden
down
as
his
companions
thought
now
master
we
are
alone
said
grey
dick
set
your
shoulders
against
mine
and
let
us
die
a
death
that
these
dogs
of
avignon
will
ay
ay
answered
hugh
but
don
t
overreach
dick
tis
ever
the
archer
s
the
mob
closed
in
on
them
then
rolled
back
like
water
from
a
rock
leaving
some
behind
again
they
closed
in
and
again
rolled
back
bring
bows
they
cried
widening
out
bring
bows
and
shoot
them
ah
gasped
dick
that
is
a
game
two
can
play
now
that
i
have
arm
almost
before
the
words
had
left
his
lips
the
great
black
bow
he
bore
was
out
and
strung
next
instant
the
shafts
began
to
rush
piercing
all
before
them
till
at
the
third
arrow
those
in
front
of
him
melted
away
save
such
as
would
stir
no
more
only
now
missiles
began
to
come
in
answer
from
this
side
and
from
that
although
as
yet
none
struck
them
unstring
your
bow
dick
and
let
us
charge
said
hugh
we
have
no
other
chance
save
flight
they
ll
pelt
us
dick
did
not
seem
to
hear
at
least
he
shot
on
as
one
who
was
not
minded
to
die
unavenged
an
arrow
whistled
through
hugh
s
cap
lifting
it
from
his
head
and
another
glanced
from
the
mail
on
his
shoulder
he
ground
his
teeth
with
rage
for
now
none
would
come
within
reach
of
his
long
sword
friend
dick
he
said
i
die
charging
and
with
a
cry
of
a
cressi
a
cressi
he
sprang
forward
one
leap
and
dick
was
at
his
side
who
had
only
bided
to
sheath
his
bow
the
mob
in
front
melted
away
before
the
flash
of
the
white
sword
and
the
gleam
of
the
grey
axe
still
they
must
have
fallen
for
their
pursuers
closed
in
behind
them
like
hunting
hounds
when
they
view
the
quarry
and
there
were
none
to
guard
their
backs
but
once
more
the
shrill
voice
cried
help
the
friends
of
the
jews
save
those
who
saved
rebecca
and
her
children
then
again
there
came
a
rush
of
men
who
hissed
and
whistled
as
they
fought
so
fierce
was
the
rush
that
those
who
followed
them
were
cut
off
and
dick
glancing
back
over
his
shoulder
saw
the
priest
their
leader
go
down
like
an
ox
beneath
the
blow
of
a
leaded
bludgeon
a
score
of
strides
and
they
were
out
of
the
range
of
the
firelight
another
score
and
they
were
hidden
by
the
gloom
in
the
mouth
of
one
of
the
narrow
streets
which
way
now
gasped
hugh
looking
back
at
the
square
where
in
the
flare
of
the
great
fires
christians
and
jews
fighting
furiously
looked
like
devils
struggling
in
the
mouth
of
hell
as
he
spoke
a
lad
darted
up
to
them
and
dick
lifted
his
axe
to
cut
him
down
friend
he
said
in
a
guttural
voice
not
foe
i
know
where
you
dwell
trust
and
follow
me
who
am
of
the
kin
of
rebecca
wife
of
lead
on
then
kin
of
rebecca
exclaimed
hugh
but
know
that
if
you
cheat
us
you
swift
swift
cried
the
lad
lest
those
swine
should
reach
your
house
before
you
and
catching
hugh
by
the
hand
he
began
to
run
like
a
hare
down
the
dark
streets
they
went
past
the
great
rock
where
the
fires
burned
at
the
gates
of
the
palace
of
the
pope
then
along
more
streets
and
across
an
open
place
where
thieves
and
peered
at
them
curiously
but
at
the
sight
of
their
drawn
steel
slunk
away
at
length
their
guide
halted
see
he
said
there
is
your
dwelling
enter
now
and
up
with
the
bridge
hark
they
come
he
was
gone
from
down
the
street
to
their
left
rose
shouts
and
the
sound
of
many
running
feet
but
there
in
front
of
them
loomed
the
tower
against
the
black
and
rainy
sky
they
dashed
across
the
little
drawbridge
that
spanned
the
moat
and
seizing
the
cranks
wound
furiously
slowly
ah
how
slowly
it
rose
for
it
was
heavy
and
they
were
but
two
tired
men
also
the
chains
and
cogs
were
rusty
with
disuse
yet
it
did
rise
and
as
it
came
home
at
last
the
fierce
mob
thirsting
for
their
blood
and
guessing
where
they
would
refuge
appeared
in
front
of
it
and
by
the
light
of
some
torches
which
they
bore
caught
sight
of
them
come
in
friends
mocked
grey
dick
as
they
ran
up
and
down
the
edge
of
the
moat
howling
with
rage
and
disappointment
come
in
if
you
would
sup
on
such
as
this
and
he
sent
one
of
his
deadly
shafts
through
the
breast
of
a
fellow
who
waved
a
torch
in
one
hand
and
a
blacksmith
s
hammer
in
the
other
then
they
drew
back
taking
the
dead
man
with
them
but
as
they
went
one
cried
the
jews
shall
not
save
you
again
wizards
for
if
we
can
not
come
at
you
to
kill
you
we
ll
starve
you
till
you
die
stay
there
and
rot
or
step
forth
and
be
torn
to
pieces
as
it
pleases
you
english
then
they
all
slunk
back
and
vanished
or
seemed
to
vanish
down
the
mouths
of
the
dark
streets
that
ran
into
the
open
place
in
front
of
the
dwelling
which
hugh
had
named
the
bride
s
tower
now
said
dick
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
brow
as
they
barred
the
massive
door
of
the
house
we
are
safe
for
this
night
at
least
and
can
eat
and
sleep
in
peace
see
you
master
i
have
taken
stock
of
this
old
place
which
must
have
been
built
in
rough
times
for
scarce
a
wall
of
it
is
less
than
five
feet
thick
the
moat
is
deep
all
round
fire
can
not
harm
it
and
it
is
for
arrows
and
not
commanded
by
any
other
building
having
the
open
place
in
front
and
below
the
wide
fosse
of
the
ancient
wall
upon
which
it
stands
therefore
even
with
this
poor
garrison
of
two
it
can
be
taken
only
by
storm
this
while
we
have
bows
and
arrows
will
cost
them
something
seeing
that
we
could
hold
the
tower
from
stair
to
ay
dick
answered
hugh
sadly
doubtless
we
can
make
a
fight
for
it
and
take
some
with
us
to
a
quieter
world
if
they
are
foolish
enough
to
give
us
a
chance
but
what
did
that
fellow
shout
as
to
starving
us
out
how
stand
we
for
provisions
foreseeing
something
of
the
sort
i
have
reckoned
that
up
master
there
s
good
water
in
the
courtyard
well
and
those
who
owned
this
tower
whoever
they
may
have
been
laid
in
great
store
perchance
for
the
marriage
feast
or
perchance
when
the
plague
began
knowing
that
it
would
bring
scarcity
the
cupboards
and
the
butteries
are
filled
with
flour
dried
flesh
wine
olives
and
oil
for
burning
even
if
these
should
fail
us
there
are
the
horses
in
the
stable
which
we
can
kill
and
cook
for
of
forage
and
fuel
i
have
found
then
the
pope
should
not
be
more
safe
than
we
dick
said
hugh
with
a
weary
smile
if
any
are
safe
in
avignon
well
let
us
go
and
eat
of
all
this
plenty
but
oh
i
wish
i
had
told
sir
andrew
where
we
dwelt
or
could
be
sure
in
which
of
that
maze
of
streets
he
and
red
eve
are
lodged
dick
dick
that
knave
basil
has
fooled
us
ay
master
said
dick
setting
his
grim
lips
but
let
him
pray
his
saint
that
before
all
is
done
i
do
not
fool
chapter
xviii
the
plague
pit
seven
long
days
had
gone
by
and
still
hugh
and
grey
dick
held
out
in
their
tower
fortress
though
as
yet
unhurt
they
were
weary
indeed
since
they
must
watch
all
night
and
could
only
sleep
by
snatches
in
the
daytime
one
lying
down
to
rest
while
the
other
kept
guard
as
they
had
foreseen
except
by
direct
assault
the
place
proved
impregnable
its
moat
protecting
it
upon
three
sides
and
the
sheer
wall
of
the
old
city
terminating
in
the
deep
fosse
upon
the
fourth
in
its
little
armoury
among
other
weapons
they
had
found
a
great
store
of
arrows
and
some
good
bows
whereof
hugh
took
the
best
and
longest
thus
armed
with
these
they
placed
themselves
behind
the
loopholes
of
the
embattled
gateway
whence
they
could
sweep
the
space
before
them
or
if
danger
threatened
them
elsewhere
there
were
embrasures
whence
they
could
command
the
bases
of
the
walls
lastly
also
there
was
the
central
tower
whereof
they
could
hold
each
landing
with
the
sword
thrice
they
had
been
attacked
since
there
seemed
to
be
hundreds
of
folk
in
avignon
bent
upon
their
destruction
but
each
time
their
bitter
arrows
that
rarely
seemed
to
miss
had
repulsed
the
foe
with
loss
even
when
an
onslaught
was
delivered
on
the
main
gateway
at
night
they
had
beaten
their
assailants
by
letting
fall
upon
them
through
the
or
overhanging
apertures
great
stones
that
had
been
piled
up
there
perhaps
generations
before
when
the
place
was
built
still
the
attacks
did
not
slacken
indeed
the
hate
of
the
citizens
of
avignon
against
these
two
bold
englishmen
whose
courage
and
resource
they
attributed
to
help
given
to
them
by
the
powers
of
evil
seemed
to
grow
from
day
to
day
even
as
the
plague
grew
in
the
streets
of
that
city
from
their
walls
they
could
see
friars
preaching
a
kind
of
crusade
against
them
they
pointed
toward
the
tower
with
crucifixes
invoking
their
hearers
to
pull
it
stone
from
stone
and
slay
the
wizards
within
the
wizards
who
had
conspired
with
the
accursed
jews
even
beneath
the
eyes
of
his
holiness
the
pope
to
bring
doom
on
avignon
the
eighth
morn
broke
at
length
and
its
first
red
rays
discovered
hugh
and
dick
kneeling
side
by
side
behind
the
battlements
of
the
gateway
each
of
them
was
making
petition
to
heaven
in
his
own
fashion
for
forgiveness
of
his
sins
since
they
were
outworn
and
believed
that
this
day
would
be
their
last
what
did
you
pray
for
dick
asked
hugh
glancing
at
his
companion
s
fierce
face
which
in
that
half
light
looked
deathlike
and
unearthly
what
did
i
pray
for
well
for
the
first
part
let
it
be
that
s
betwixt
me
and
whatever
power
sent
me
out
to
do
its
business
on
the
earth
but
for
the
last
i
ll
tell
you
it
was
that
we
may
go
hence
with
such
a
guard
of
dead
french
as
never
yet
escorted
two
englishmen
from
avignon
to
heaven
or
hell
ay
and
we
will
master
for
as
they
shouted
to
us
they
ll
storm
this
tower
but
if
our
strength
holds
out
there
s
many
a
one
who
ll
never
win
its
rather
would
i
have
died
peacefully
dick
yet
the
blood
of
these
hounds
will
not
weigh
upon
my
soul
seeing
that
they
seek
to
murder
us
for
no
fault
except
that
we
saved
a
woman
and
two
children
from
their
cruel
devilries
oh
could
i
but
know
that
red
eve
and
sir
andrew
were
safe
away
i
d
die
a
happy
i
think
we
shall
know
that
and
much
more
before
s
dawn
master
or
never
know
anything
again
look
they
gather
yonder
now
let
us
eat
for
perhaps
later
we
shall
find
no
the
afternoon
drew
on
toward
evening
and
still
these
two
lived
of
all
the
hundreds
of
missiles
which
were
shot
or
hurled
at
them
although
a
few
struck
not
one
of
them
had
pierced
their
armour
so
as
to
do
them
hurt
the
walls
and
battlements
or
some
good
fate
had
protected
them
thrice
had
the
french
come
on
and
thrice
they
had
retreated
before
those
arrows
that
could
not
miss
and
as
yet
bridge
and
doors
were
safe
look
said
dick
as
he
set
down
a
cup
of
wine
that
he
had
drained
for
his
thirst
was
raging
they
send
an
embassy
and
he
pointed
to
a
priest
the
same
fellow
who
preached
in
the
square
when
the
notary
basil
led
them
into
a
trap
and
to
a
man
with
him
who
bore
a
white
cloth
upon
a
lance
shall
i
shoot
them
nay
answered
hugh
why
kill
crazed
folk
who
think
that
they
serve
god
in
their
own
fashion
we
will
hear
what
they
have
to
presently
the
pair
stood
within
speaking
distance
and
the
priest
called
out
hearken
you
wizards
so
far
your
master
the
devil
has
protected
you
but
now
your
hour
has
come
we
have
authority
from
those
who
rule
this
city
and
from
the
church
to
summon
you
to
surrender
and
if
you
will
not
then
to
slay
you
that
you
shameless
friar
answered
hugh
you
have
been
striving
to
do
these
many
days
yet
it
is
not
we
who
have
been
slain
although
we
stand
but
two
men
against
a
multitude
but
if
we
surrender
what
then
then
you
shall
be
put
upon
your
trial
wizards
and
if
found
guilty
burned
if
innocent
set
put
upon
our
trial
before
our
executioners
why
i
think
those
fires
are
alight
already
nay
nay
mad
priest
go
back
and
tell
those
whom
you
have
fooled
that
if
they
want
us
they
can
come
and
take
us
which
they
ll
not
do
then
the
furious
friar
began
to
curse
them
hurling
at
them
the
anathemas
of
the
church
till
at
length
dick
called
to
him
to
begone
or
he
would
send
an
arrow
to
help
him
on
the
road
so
they
went
and
presently
the
sun
sank
now
let
us
beware
said
dick
the
moon
is
near
her
full
and
will
rise
soon
they
ll
attack
between
times
when
we
can
not
see
to
ay
answered
hugh
moreover
now
this
gateway
is
no
place
for
us
of
arrows
there
are
few
left
nor
could
we
see
to
use
them
in
the
dark
the
stones
too
are
all
spent
and
therefore
they
can
bridge
the
moat
and
batter
down
the
doors
what
then
asked
dick
as
we
can
not
fly
where
shall
we
die
on
the
roof
of
the
old
tower
i
think
whence
we
can
hurl
ourselves
at
last
and
so
perhaps
escape
being
taken
alive
and
torment
look
you
dick
that
tower
is
mounted
by
three
straight
flights
of
steps
the
first
two
of
these
we
ll
hold
with
such
arrows
as
remain
to
us
there
are
three
and
twenty
as
i
think
and
the
last
with
axe
and
sword
listen
they
come
take
a
brand
from
the
hall
hearth
and
let
us
go
light
the
so
they
went
and
set
fire
to
the
great
torches
of
wood
and
tallow
that
were
set
in
their
iron
holders
to
light
the
steps
of
the
tower
ere
the
last
of
them
was
burning
they
heard
their
enemies
ravening
without
listen
said
hugh
as
they
descended
to
the
head
of
the
first
flight
of
stairs
they
are
across
the
as
he
spoke
the
massive
doors
crashed
in
beneath
the
blows
of
a
baulk
of
timber
now
said
hugh
as
they
strung
their
bows
six
arrows
apiece
here
if
we
can
get
off
so
many
and
the
odd
eleven
at
our
next
stand
ah
they
the
mob
rushed
into
the
hall
below
waving
torches
and
swords
and
hunting
it
as
dogs
hunt
a
covert
the
english
wizards
have
hid
themselves
away
cried
a
voice
let
us
burn
the
place
for
so
we
are
sure
to
catch
nay
nay
answered
another
voice
that
of
the
mad
friar
we
must
have
them
beneath
the
torture
that
we
may
learn
how
to
lift
the
curse
from
avignon
and
the
names
of
their
accomplices
on
earth
and
in
hell
search
search
search
little
need
to
search
said
grey
dick
stepping
out
on
to
the
landing
devil
go
join
your
in
that
hell
you
talk
of
and
he
sent
an
arrow
through
his
heart
for
a
moment
there
followed
the
silence
of
consternation
while
the
mob
stood
staring
at
their
fallen
leader
then
with
a
yell
of
rage
they
charged
the
stair
and
that
fray
began
which
was
told
of
in
avignon
for
generations
hugh
and
dick
shot
their
arrows
nor
could
they
miss
seeing
what
was
their
target
indeed
some
of
those
from
the
great
black
bow
pinned
foe
to
foe
beneath
them
but
so
crowded
were
the
assailants
on
the
narrow
stair
that
they
could
not
shoot
back
they
advanced
helpless
thrust
to
their
doom
by
the
weight
of
those
who
pressed
behind
now
they
were
near
the
dead
still
on
their
feet
being
borne
forward
by
the
living
to
whom
they
served
as
shields
hugh
and
dick
ran
to
the
head
of
the
second
flight
and
thence
shot
off
the
arrows
that
remained
dick
loosed
the
last
of
them
and
of
this
fearful
shaft
it
was
said
that
it
slew
three
men
piercing
through
the
body
of
one
the
throat
of
the
second
and
burying
its
barb
in
the
skull
of
the
third
on
the
lowest
step
now
dick
unstrung
his
bow
and
thrust
it
into
its
case
on
his
shoulder
for
he
was
minded
that
they
should
go
together
at
the
last
shafts
have
sung
their
song
he
said
with
a
fierce
laugh
now
it
is
the
turn
of
the
axe
and
sword
to
make
another
then
he
gripped
sir
hugh
by
the
hand
saying
farewell
master
oh
i
hold
this
a
merry
death
such
as
the
saints
grant
to
few
ay
and
so
would
you
were
you
as
free
as
i
am
well
doubtless
your
lady
has
gone
before
or
at
worst
soon
she
will
follow
after
and
greet
you
in
the
gate
of
death
where
murgh
sits
and
keeps
his
count
of
passing
farewell
friend
answered
hugh
be
she
quick
or
dead
thus
red
eve
would
wish
that
i
should
die
cressi
a
cressi
he
cried
and
drove
his
sword
through
the
throat
of
a
soldier
who
rushed
at
him
they
fought
a
very
good
fight
as
doubtless
the
dead
were
telling
each
other
while
they
passed
from
that
red
stair
to
such
rest
as
they
had
won
they
had
fought
a
very
good
fight
and
it
was
hard
to
say
which
had
done
the
best
hugh
s
white
sword
or
dick
s
grey
axe
and
now
unwounded
still
save
for
a
bruise
or
two
they
stood
there
in
the
moonlight
upon
the
stark
edge
of
the
tall
tower
the
foe
in
front
and
black
space
beneath
there
they
stood
leaning
on
axe
and
sword
and
drawing
their
breath
in
great
sobs
those
two
great
harvestmen
who
that
day
had
toiled
so
hard
in
the
rich
fields
of
death
for
a
while
the
crowd
of
their
assailants
remained
still
staring
at
them
then
the
leaders
began
to
whisper
to
each
other
for
they
scarcely
seemed
to
dare
to
talk
aloud
what
shall
we
do
asked
one
these
are
not
men
no
men
could
have
fought
as
they
have
fought
us
for
seven
days
and
at
last
have
slain
us
like
sparrows
in
a
net
and
themselves
remained
no
answered
another
and
no
mortal
archer
could
send
his
shaft
through
the
bodies
of
three
still
it
is
finished
now
unless
they
find
wings
and
fly
away
so
let
us
take
yes
yes
broke
in
grey
dick
with
his
hissing
laugh
come
and
take
us
you
curs
of
avignon
having
our
breath
again
we
are
ready
to
be
taken
and
he
lifted
his
axe
and
shook
it
seize
them
shouted
the
leader
of
the
french
seize
them
echoed
those
who
poured
up
the
stairs
behind
but
there
the
matter
ended
since
none
could
find
stomach
to
face
that
axe
and
sword
so
at
length
they
took
another
counsel
bring
bows
and
shoot
them
through
the
legs
thus
we
shall
bring
them
living
to
their
trial
commanded
the
captain
of
the
men
of
avignon
he
was
their
fourth
captain
on
that
one
day
for
the
other
three
lay
upon
the
stairs
or
in
the
hall
now
hugh
and
dick
spoke
together
few
words
and
swift
as
to
whether
they
should
charge
or
leap
from
the
wall
and
have
done
with
it
while
they
spoke
a
little
cloud
floated
over
the
face
of
the
moon
so
that
until
it
had
gone
the
french
could
not
see
to
shoot
it
s
too
risky
said
hugh
if
they
capture
us
we
must
die
a
death
to
which
i
have
no
mind
let
us
hurl
our
weapons
at
them
then
so
be
it
whispered
dick
do
you
aim
at
the
captain
on
the
left
and
i
will
take
the
other
ready
now
i
think
one
creeps
near
to
i
think
so
too
hugh
whispered
back
i
felt
the
touch
of
his
garments
only
he
seemed
to
pass
us
from
behind
which
can
not
the
cloud
passed
and
once
again
they
were
bathed
in
silver
light
it
showed
the
men
of
avignon
already
bending
their
bows
it
showed
hugh
and
grey
dick
lifting
axe
and
sword
to
hurl
them
but
between
them
and
their
mark
it
showed
also
a
figure
that
they
knew
well
a
stern
and
terrible
figure
wearing
a
strange
cap
of
red
and
yellow
and
a
cape
of
rich
black
fur
o
god
of
heaven
tis
murgh
the
helper
gasped
hugh
ay
murgh
the
fire
murgh
the
sword
said
dick
adding
quietly
it
is
true
i
was
wondering
whether
he
would
prove
as
good
as
his
word
look
now
look
they
see
him
also
see
him
they
did
indeed
and
for
a
moment
there
was
silence
on
that
crowded
tower
top
where
stood
at
least
a
score
of
men
while
their
fellows
packed
the
hall
and
stair
below
by
hundreds
all
stared
at
murgh
and
murgh
stared
back
at
them
with
his
cold
eyes
then
a
voice
screamed
satan
satan
come
from
hell
to
guard
his
own
death
himself
is
with
you
fly
men
of
avignon
fly
small
need
was
there
for
this
command
already
casting
down
their
bows
those
on
the
tower
top
were
rushing
to
the
mouth
of
the
stair
and
since
it
was
blocked
with
men
using
their
swords
upon
them
to
hew
a
road
now
those
below
thinking
that
it
was
the
english
wizards
who
slew
them
struck
back
presently
all
that
stair
and
the
crowded
hall
below
black
as
the
mouth
of
the
pit
for
such
lights
as
still
burned
soon
were
swept
away
rang
with
the
screams
and
curses
and
stifled
groans
of
the
trodden
down
or
dying
in
the
pitchy
darkness
brother
smote
brother
friend
trampled
out
the
life
of
friend
till
the
steep
steps
were
piled
high
and
the
doorways
blocked
with
dead
so
hideous
were
the
sounds
indeed
that
hugh
and
grey
dick
crossed
themselves
thinking
that
hell
had
come
to
avignon
or
avignon
sunk
down
to
hell
but
murgh
only
folded
his
hands
upon
his
breast
and
smiled
at
length
save
for
the
moaning
of
those
hurt
men
who
still
lived
the
dreadful
tumult
sank
to
silence
then
murgh
turned
and
spoke
in
his
slow
and
icy
voice
you
were
about
to
seek
me
in
the
fosse
of
this
high
tower
were
you
not
hugh
de
cressi
and
richard
archer
a
foolish
thought
in
truth
and
a
sinful
so
sinful
that
it
would
have
served
you
well
if
i
had
let
you
come
but
your
strait
was
sore
and
your
faith
was
weak
and
i
had
no
such
command
therefore
i
have
come
to
others
whose
names
were
written
in
my
book
ay
and
being
half
human
after
all
for
does
not
your
creed
tell
you
that
i
was
born
of
sin
i
rejoice
that
it
is
given
to
me
to
protect
those
who
would
have
protected
when
seemed
to
stand
helpless
in
the
hands
of
cruel
men
nay
thank
me
not
what
need
have
i
of
your
thanks
which
are
due
to
god
alone
and
question
me
not
for
why
should
i
answer
your
questions
even
if
i
know
those
answers
only
do
my
bidding
this
night
seek
whom
you
will
in
avignon
but
ere
the
dawn
ride
away
for
we
three
must
meet
again
at
a
place
appointed
before
this
winter
s
snows
are
o
dread
lord
of
death
one
thing
only
one
began
hugh
but
murgh
held
up
his
hand
and
replied
have
i
not
said
that
i
answer
no
questions
now
go
forth
and
follow
the
promptings
of
your
heart
till
we
meet
then
gliding
to
the
head
of
the
stair
he
vanished
in
the
shadow
say
what
shall
we
do
asked
hugh
in
amazed
voice
it
matters
little
what
we
do
or
leave
undone
master
seeing
that
we
are
men
whom
as
i
think
none
can
harm
until
a
day
that
will
not
dawn
nor
yet
awhile
therefore
let
us
wash
ourselves
and
eat
and
borrow
new
garments
if
we
can
find
any
that
are
not
soiled
and
then
if
the
horses
are
still
unharmed
mount
and
ride
from
this
accursed
avignon
for
nay
dick
since
first
we
must
learn
whether
or
no
we
leave
friends
behind
us
ay
master
if
you
will
but
since
yonder
murgh
said
nothing
of
them
it
was
in
my
mind
that
they
are
either
dead
or
not
dead
i
pray
dick
oh
i
am
sure
not
dead
and
i
left
living
when
red
eve
and
i
met
murgh
had
been
with
her
and
promised
that
she
would
recover
and
be
strong
answered
hugh
bravely
although
there
was
a
note
of
terror
in
his
voice
red
eve
has
other
foes
in
avignon
besides
the
pest
muttered
grey
dick
adding
still
let
us
have
faith
it
is
a
good
friend
to
man
did
not
yonder
helper
chide
us
for
our
lack
of
it
they
forced
a
way
down
the
tower
stair
crawling
through
the
darkness
over
the
bodies
of
the
fallen
they
crossed
the
hall
that
also
was
full
of
dead
and
of
wounded
whose
pitiful
groans
echoed
from
the
vaulted
roof
and
climbed
another
stair
to
their
chamber
in
the
gateway
tower
here
from
a
spark
of
fire
that
still
smouldered
on
the
hearth
they
lit
the
lamps
of
and
by
the
light
of
them
washed
off
the
stains
of
battle
and
refreshed
themselves
with
food
and
wine
these
things
done
dick
returned
to
the
hall
and
presently
brought
thence
two
suits
of
armour
and
some
cloaks
which
he
had
taken
either
from
the
walls
or
from
off
the
slain
in
these
they
disguised
themselves
as
best
they
could
as
de
noyon
had
disguised
himself
at
crecy
then
having
collected
a
store
of
arrows
whereof
many
lay
about
they
departed
by
the
back
entrance
the
great
front
doorway
was
so
choked
with
corpses
that
they
could
not
pass
it
since
here
had
raged
the
last
fearful
struggle
to
escape
going
to
the
little
where
they
found
their
horses
unharmed
in
the
stalls
although
frightened
by
the
tumult
and
stiff
from
lack
of
exercise
they
fed
and
saddled
them
and
led
them
out
so
presently
they
looked
their
last
upon
the
bride
s
tower
that
had
sheltered
them
so
well
it
has
served
our
turn
said
hugh
glancing
back
at
it
from
the
other
side
of
the
deserted
square
but
oh
i
pray
heaven
that
we
may
never
see
that
again
as
he
spoke
a
figure
appeared
from
the
shadow
of
a
doorway
and
ran
toward
them
thinking
it
was
that
of
some
foe
dick
lifted
his
axe
to
cut
him
down
whereon
a
voice
cried
in
english
hold
i
am
david
david
exclaimed
hugh
then
thanks
be
to
god
for
know
we
thought
you
dead
these
many
ay
sir
answered
the
young
man
as
i
thought
you
the
rumour
reached
the
jews
among
whom
i
have
been
hiding
while
i
recovered
of
my
hurts
that
the
mad
monk
and
his
fellows
had
stormed
the
tower
and
killed
you
both
therefore
i
crept
out
to
learn
for
myself
now
i
have
found
you
by
your
voices
who
never
again
hoped
to
look
upon
you
living
and
he
began
to
sob
in
his
relief
and
joy
come
on
lad
said
grey
dick
kindly
this
is
no
place
for
whither
go
you
sir
asked
david
as
he
walked
forward
alongside
of
the
horses
to
seek
that
house
where
we
saw
sir
andrew
arnold
and
the
lady
eve
answered
hugh
if
by
any
chance
it
can
be
that
is
easy
sir
said
david
as
it
happens
i
passed
it
not
much
more
than
an
hour
ago
and
knew
it
did
you
see
any
one
there
asked
hugh
eagerly
nay
the
windows
were
dark
also
the
jew
guiding
me
said
he
had
heard
that
all
who
dwelt
in
that
house
were
dead
of
the
plague
still
of
this
matter
he
knew
nothing
for
hugh
groaned
but
only
answered
forward
as
they
went
david
told
them
his
story
it
seemed
that
when
he
was
struck
down
in
the
square
where
the
crazy
friar
preached
and
like
to
be
stabbed
and
trampled
to
death
some
of
the
jews
dragged
him
into
the
shadow
and
rescued
him
afterward
they
took
him
to
a
horrid
and
squalid
quarter
called
la
juiverie
into
which
no
christian
dare
enter
here
he
lay
sick
of
his
hurts
and
unable
to
get
out
until
that
very
afternoon
the
widow
rebecca
whom
they
had
saved
nursing
him
all
the
while
did
you
hear
aught
of
us
asked
dick
ay
at
first
that
you
were
holding
dead
bride
s
tower
bravely
so
as
soon
as
i
might
i
came
to
join
you
there
if
i
could
win
in
and
you
still
lived
but
they
told
me
that
you
had
fallen
at
ah
said
dick
well
as
it
chances
it
was
not
we
who
fell
but
that
tale
is
long
still
david
you
are
a
brave
lad
who
would
have
come
to
die
with
us
and
my
master
will
thank
you
when
he
can
give
his
mind
to
such
things
say
did
you
hear
aught
else
ay
dick
i
heard
two
days
ago
that
the
french
lord
cattrina
whom
sir
hugh
was
to
have
fought
at
venice
had
left
avignon
none
knew
why
or
whither
he
doubtless
because
of
the
plague
and
he
wished
to
go
where
there
was
none
answered
dick
but
hugh
groaned
again
thinking
to
himself
that
acour
would
scarcely
have
left
avignon
if
eve
were
still
alive
within
its
walls
after
this
they
went
on
in
silence
meeting
very
few
and
speaking
with
none
for
the
part
of
the
great
city
through
which
they
passed
seemed
to
be
almost
deserted
indeed
in
this
quarter
the
pest
was
so
fearful
that
all
who
remained
alive
and
could
do
so
had
fled
elsewhere
leaving
behind
them
only
the
sick
and
those
who
plundered
houses
one
thing
i
forgot
to
say
said
david
presently
the
jews
told
me
that
they
had
certain
information
that
the
notary
knave
basil
was
paid
by
the
lord
cattrina
to
lead
us
to
that
square
where
the
fires
burned
in
order
that
we
might
be
murdered
there
further
our
death
was
to
be
the
signal
for
the
massacre
of
all
the
jews
only
as
it
chanced
their
plan
went
as
will
basil
s
neck
if
ever
i
meet
him
again
muttered
grey
dick
beneath
his
breath
lord
what
fools
we
were
to
trust
that
man
well
we
ve
paid
the
price
and
please
god
so
shall
they
turned
the
corner
and
rode
down
another
street
till
presently
david
said
halt
yonder
is
the
house
see
the
cognizance
above
the
gateway
hugh
and
dick
leapt
from
their
horses
the
latter
bidding
david
lead
them
into
the
courtyard
and
hold
them
there
then
they
entered
the
house
of
which
the
door
was
ajar
and
by
the
shine
of
the
moon
that
struggled
through
the
crept
up
the
stairs
and
passages
till
they
reached
those
rooms
where
sir
andrew
and
eve
had
lodged
hist
said
dick
and
he
pointed
to
a
line
of
light
that
showed
beneath
the
closed
door
hugh
pushed
it
gently
and
it
opened
a
little
they
looked
through
the
crack
and
within
saw
a
man
in
a
dark
robe
who
was
seated
at
a
table
counting
out
gold
by
the
light
of
a
lamp
just
then
he
lifted
his
head
having
felt
the
draught
of
air
from
the
open
door
it
was
the
notary
basil
without
a
word
they
entered
the
room
closing
and
bolting
the
door
behind
them
then
dick
leapt
on
basil
as
a
wolf
leaps
and
held
him
fat
while
hugh
ran
past
him
and
threw
wide
the
door
of
that
chamber
in
which
eve
had
lain
sick
it
was
empty
back
he
came
again
and
in
a
terrible
voice
said
now
sir
notary
where
are
the
lady
eve
and
sir
andrew
her
guardian
alas
sir
knight
began
the
knave
in
a
quavering
voice
both
of
them
are
what
cried
hugh
supporting
himself
against
the
wall
for
at
this
terrible
news
his
knees
trembled
beneath
him
have
you
or
your
patron
cattrina
murdered
them
murdered
them
sir
knight
i
do
murder
i
a
christian
and
a
man
of
peace
never
and
the
noble
lord
of
cattrina
count
de
noyon
why
he
wished
to
marry
the
lady
not
to
murder
her
indeed
he
swore
that
she
was
his
so
you
know
all
these
things
do
you
villain
said
grey
dick
shaking
him
as
a
terrier
shakes
a
rat
sir
knight
went
on
the
frightened
fellow
blame
me
not
for
the
acts
of
god
he
slew
these
noble
persons
not
i
i
myself
saw
the
lovely
lady
carried
from
this
house
wrapped
in
a
red
so
you
were
in
the
house
were
you
said
grey
dick
shaking
him
again
well
whither
did
they
carry
her
thief
of
the
night
to
the
plague
pit
good
sir
where
else
in
these
times
now
hugh
groaned
aloud
his
eyes
closed
and
he
seemed
as
though
he
were
about
to
fall
grey
dick
noting
it
for
a
moment
let
go
of
the
notary
and
turned
as
though
to
help
his
master
like
a
flash
basil
drew
a
dagger
from
under
his
dirty
robe
and
struck
at
dick
s
back
the
blow
was
well
aimed
nor
could
an
unprotected
man
on
whom
it
fell
have
escaped
death
but
although
basil
did
not
see
it
because
of
dick
s
long
cloak
beneath
this
cloak
he
wore
the
best
of
mail
and
on
that
mail
the
slender
dagger
broke
its
point
falling
harmless
to
the
ground
next
instant
dick
had
him
again
in
his
iron
grip
paying
no
further
heed
to
hugh
who
had
sunk
to
the
floor
a
huddled
heap
he
began
to
speak
into
the
lawyer
s
ear
in
his
slow
hissing
voice
devil
he
said
whether
or
no
you
murdered
red
eve
and
sir
andrew
arnold
the
saint
i
can
not
say
for
certain
though
doubtless
i
shall
learn
in
time
at
least
a
while
ago
you
who
had
taken
our
money
strove
to
murder
both
of
us
or
cause
us
to
be
torn
in
pieces
upon
yonder
square
where
the
fires
burned
now
too
you
have
striven
to
murder
me
with
that
bodkin
of
yours
not
knowing
fool
that
i
am
safe
from
all
men
well
say
your
prayers
since
you
too
journey
to
the
plague
pit
for
so
the
gatherers
of
the
dead
will
think
you
sir
gasped
the
terrified
wretch
spare
me
and
i
will
speak
more
lies
hissed
dick
into
his
ear
nay
go
tell
them
to
the
father
of
lies
for
i
have
no
time
to
waste
in
hearkening
to
them
take
your
pay
traitor
a
few
seconds
later
basil
lay
dead
upon
the
floor
grey
dick
looked
at
him
kneeling
down
he
thrust
his
hands
into
the
man
s
pockets
and
took
thence
the
gold
that
he
had
been
hiding
away
when
they
came
upon
him
no
small
sum
as
it
chanced
our
own
come
back
with
interest
he
said
with
one
of
his
silent
laughs
and
we
shall
need
monies
for
our
faring
why
here
s
a
writing
also
which
may
tell
those
who
can
read
it
he
cast
it
on
the
table
then
turned
to
his
master
who
was
awakening
from
his
swoon
dick
helped
him
to
his
feet
what
has
passed
asked
hugh
in
a
hollow
voice
murgh
answered
dick
pointing
to
the
dead
man
on
the
floor
have
you
killed
him
friend
ay
sure
enough
as
he
strove
to
kill
me
and
again
he
pointed
this
time
to
the
broken
dagger
hugh
made
no
answer
only
seeing
the
writing
on
the
table
took
it
up
and
began
to
read
like
one
who
knows
not
what
he
does
presently
his
eyes
brightened
and
he
said
what
does
this
mean
i
wonder
rogue
you
have
cheated
me
as
you
cheat
all
men
and
now
i
follow
her
who
has
gone
be
sure
however
that
you
shall
reap
your
reward
in
due
season
de
i
know
not
said
dick
and
the
interpreter
is
silent
and
he
kicked
the
body
of
basil
perhaps
i
was
a
little
over
hasty
who
might
have
squeezed
the
truth
out
of
him
before
the
her
who
is
gone
reflected
hugh
aloud
tis
red
eve
who
is
gone
and
de
noyon
is
scarcely
the
man
to
seek
her
among
passed
souls
moreover
the
jews
swear
that
he
rode
from
avignon
two
days
ago
come
dick
let
that
carrion
lie
and
to
the
plague
an
hour
later
and
they
stood
on
the
edge
of
that
dreadful
place
hearing
and
seeing
things
which
are
best
left
untold
a
priest
came
up
to
them
one
of
those
good
men
who
caring
nothing
for
themselves
still
dared
to
celebrate
the
last
rites
of
the
church
above
the
poor
departed
friends
he
said
you
seem
to
be
in
trouble
can
i
help
you
for
jesus
sake
perchance
holy
father
answered
hugh
tell
us
you
who
watch
this
dreadful
place
was
a
woman
wrapped
in
a
red
cloak
thrown
in
here
two
or
three
days
gone
alas
yes
said
the
priest
with
a
sigh
for
i
read
the
office
over
her
and
others
nay
what
are
you
about
to
do
by
now
she
is
two
fathoms
deep
and
burned
away
with
lime
so
that
none
could
know
her
if
you
enter
there
the
guards
will
not
let
you
thence
living
moreover
it
is
useless
pray
to
god
to
comfort
you
poor
man
as
i
will
who
am
sure
it
will
not
be
then
dick
led
or
rather
carried
hugh
from
the
brink
of
that
awesome
common
grave
chapter
xix
the
doom
it
was
the
last
night
of
february
the
bitterest
night
perhaps
of
all
that
sad
winter
when
at
length
hugh
de
cressi
grey
dick
and
david
day
rode
into
the
town
of
dunwich
only
that
morning
they
had
landed
at
yarmouth
after
a
long
long
journey
whereof
the
perils
and
the
horrors
may
be
guessed
but
need
not
be
written
france
through
which
they
had
passed
seemed
to
be
but
one
vast
grave
over
which
the
wail
of
those
who
still
survived
went
up
without
cease
to
the
cold
unpitying
heavens
here
in
england
the
tale
was
still
the
same
thus
in
the
great
seaport
of
yarmouth
scarcely
enough
people
were
left
alive
to
inter
the
unshriven
dead
nor
of
these
would
any
stay
to
speak
with
them
fearing
lest
they
had
brought
a
fresh
curse
from
overseas
even
the
horses
that
they
rode
they
took
from
a
stable
where
they
whinnied
hungrily
none
being
there
to
feed
them
leaving
in
their
place
a
writing
of
the
debt
betwixt
yarmouth
and
dunwich
they
had
travelled
through
smitten
towns
and
villages
where
a
few
wandered
fearfully
distraught
with
sorrow
or
seeking
food
in
the
streets
the
very
dogs
lay
dead
and
in
the
fields
they
saw
the
carcasses
of
cattle
dragged
from
the
smokeless
and
deserted
steadings
and
half
hidden
in
a
of
snow
for
the
black
plague
spared
neither
man
nor
beast
at
the
little
port
of
lowestoft
they
met
a
sullen
sailorman
who
stood
staring
at
the
beach
whereon
his
fishing
boat
lay
overturned
and
awash
for
lack
of
hands
to
drag
it
out
of
reach
of
the
angry
sea
they
asked
him
if
he
knew
of
how
it
fared
with
dunwich
by
way
of
answer
he
cursed
them
adding
must
i
be
forever
pestered
as
to
dunwich
this
is
the
third
time
of
late
that
i
have
heard
of
dunwich
from
wandering
folk
begone
thither
and
gather
tidings
for
yourselves
which
i
hope
will
please
you
as
well
as
they
do
now
if
i
were
not
in
haste
i
would
stay
a
while
to
teach
you
manners
you
churl
muttered
grey
dick
between
his
teeth
let
the
fellow
be
said
hugh
wearily
the
men
of
lowestoft
have
ever
hated
those
of
dunwich
and
it
seems
that
a
common
woe
does
not
soften
hearts
soon
enough
we
shall
learn
the
ay
you
ll
learn
it
soon
enough
shouted
the
brute
after
them
dunwich
boats
won
t
steel
lowestoft
herrings
for
many
a
year
so
they
rode
on
through
kessland
which
they
reached
as
night
was
closing
in
through
benacre
and
wrentham
also
past
houses
in
which
none
seemed
to
dwell
murgh
has
been
here
before
us
i
think
said
dick
at
length
then
i
hope
that
we
may
overtake
him
answered
hugh
with
a
smile
for
i
need
his
tidings
or
his
rest
oh
dick
dick
he
added
i
wonder
has
ever
man
borne
a
heavier
burden
for
all
this
weary
while
if
i
were
sure
it
would
not
be
so
bad
for
when
earthly
hope
is
done
we
may
turn
to
other
comfort
but
i
m
not
sure
basil
may
have
lied
the
priest
by
the
pit
could
only
swear
to
the
red
cloak
of
which
there
are
many
though
few
be
buried
in
them
and
dick
there
are
worse
things
than
that
perchance
acour
got
her
after
and
perchance
he
didn
t
answered
dick
well
fret
on
if
you
will
the
thing
does
not
trouble
me
who
for
my
part
am
sure
of
what
man
of
what
of
seeing
the
lady
eve
ere
in
this
world
or
the
next
dick
in
this
i
don
t
reckon
of
the
next
mayhap
there
we
shall
be
blind
and
not
see
besides
of
what
use
is
that
world
to
you
where
it
is
written
that
they
neither
marry
nor
are
given
in
marriage
but
are
as
the
angels
you
ll
make
no
good
angel
i
m
thinking
while
as
for
the
lady
eve
she
s
too
human
for
it
as
why
do
you
think
we
shall
see
her
on
earth
asked
hugh
ignoring
these
reflections
because
he
who
is
called
the
helper
said
as
much
and
whatever
he
may
be
he
is
no
liar
do
you
not
remember
what
red
eve
told
you
when
she
awoke
from
that
dream
of
hers
which
was
no
dream
and
do
you
not
remember
what
sir
andrew
told
you
as
to
a
certain
meeting
in
the
snow
pest
upon
it
and
he
wiped
some
of
the
driving
flakes
from
his
face
sir
andrew
who
is
a
saint
and
therefore
like
murgh
can
be
no
liar
if
you
think
thus
said
hugh
in
a
new
voice
why
did
you
not
say
so
before
because
i
love
not
argument
master
and
if
i
had
you
would
ever
have
reasoned
with
me
from
avignon
to
yarmouth
town
and
spoilt
my
sleep
of
nights
oh
where
is
your
faith
what
is
faith
dick
the
gift
of
belief
master
a
very
great
gift
seeing
what
a
man
believes
is
and
will
be
true
for
him
however
false
it
may
prove
for
others
he
who
believes
nothing
sows
nothing
and
therefore
reaps
nothing
good
or
who
taught
you
these
things
dick
one
whom
i
am
not
likely
to
forget
or
you
either
one
who
is
my
master
at
archery
and
whose
words
like
his
arrows
though
they
be
few
yet
strike
the
heart
of
hidden
truth
oh
fear
not
doubtless
sorrow
waits
you
yonder
and
he
pointed
toward
dunwich
yet
it
comes
to
my
lips
that
there
s
joy
beyond
the
sorrows
the
joy
of
battle
and
of
love
for
those
who
care
for
love
which
i
think
foolishness
there
stands
a
farm
and
the
farmer
is
a
friend
of
mine
or
used
to
be
let
us
go
thither
and
feed
these
poor
beasts
and
ourselves
or
i
think
we
will
never
come
to
dunwich
through
this
cold
and
snow
moreover
he
added
thoughtfully
joy
or
sorrow
or
both
of
them
are
best
met
by
full
men
and
i
wish
to
look
to
your
harness
and
my
own
for
sword
and
axe
are
rusted
with
the
sea
who
knows
but
that
we
may
need
them
in
dunwich
or
beyond
when
we
meet
with
murgh
as
he
promised
that
we
so
they
rode
up
to
the
house
and
found
dick
s
friend
the
farmer
lying
dead
there
in
his
own
yard
whither
his
family
had
dragged
him
ere
they
determined
to
fly
the
place
still
there
was
fodder
in
the
stable
and
they
lit
a
fire
in
the
kitchen
hearth
and
drank
of
the
wine
which
they
had
brought
with
them
from
the
ship
and
ate
of
the
bacon
which
still
hung
from
the
rafters
this
done
they
lay
down
to
sleep
a
while
about
one
in
the
morning
however
hugh
roused
dick
and
david
saying
that
he
could
rest
no
more
and
that
something
in
his
heart
bade
him
push
on
to
dunwich
then
let
us
follow
your
heart
master
said
dick
yawning
yet
i
wish
it
had
waited
till
dawn
to
move
you
yes
let
us
follow
your
heart
to
good
or
evil
david
go
you
out
and
saddle
up
those
for
dick
had
worked
late
at
their
mail
and
weapons
which
now
were
bright
and
sharp
again
and
was
very
weary
it
was
after
three
in
the
morning
when
at
length
leaving
the
heath
they
rode
up
to
dunwich
middlegate
expecting
to
find
it
shut
against
them
at
such
an
hour
but
it
stood
open
nor
did
any
challenge
them
from
the
guardhouse
they
keep
an
ill
watch
in
dunwich
grumbled
dick
well
perchance
there
is
one
here
to
whom
they
can
trust
that
hugh
made
no
answer
only
pressed
on
down
the
narrow
street
that
was
deep
and
dumb
with
snow
till
at
length
they
drew
reign
before
the
door
of
his
father
s
house
in
the
the
great
house
where
he
was
born
he
looked
at
the
windows
and
noted
that
although
they
were
unshuttered
no
friendly
light
shone
in
them
he
called
aloud
but
echo
was
his
only
answer
echo
and
the
moan
of
the
bitter
wind
and
the
sullen
roar
of
the
sea
doubtless
all
men
are
asleep
he
said
why
should
it
be
otherwise
at
such
an
hour
let
us
enter
and
waken
yes
yes
answered
dick
as
he
dismounted
and
threw
the
reins
of
his
horse
to
david
they
are
like
the
rest
of
dunwich
so
they
entered
and
began
to
search
the
house
by
the
dim
light
of
the
moon
first
they
searched
the
lower
chambers
then
those
where
hugh
s
father
and
his
brothers
had
slept
and
lastly
the
attics
here
they
found
the
pallets
of
the
upon
the
floor
but
none
at
rest
upon
them
the
house
is
deserted
said
hugh
heavily
yes
yes
answered
dick
again
in
a
cheerful
voice
doubtless
master
de
cressi
and
your
brothers
have
moved
away
to
escape
the
pray
god
they
have
escaped
it
muttered
hugh
this
place
stifles
me
he
added
let
us
whither
shall
we
go
master
to
blythburgh
manor
he
answered
for
there
i
may
win
tidings
david
bide
you
here
and
if
you
can
learn
aught
follow
us
across
the
moor
the
manor
can
not
be
so
once
more
hugh
and
dick
mounted
their
horses
and
rode
away
through
the
town
stopping
now
and
again
before
some
house
they
knew
and
calling
to
its
inmates
but
though
they
called
loudly
none
answered
soon
they
grew
sure
that
this
was
because
there
were
none
to
answer
since
of
those
houses
many
of
the
doors
stood
open
only
one
living
creature
did
they
see
in
dunwich
as
they
turned
the
corner
near
to
the
blythburgh
gate
they
met
a
man
wrapped
up
in
tattered
blankets
which
were
tied
about
him
with
haybands
he
carried
in
his
hand
a
beautiful
flagon
of
silver
doubtless
he
had
stolen
it
from
some
church
seeing
them
he
cast
this
flagon
into
the
snow
and
began
to
whimper
like
a
dog
mad
tom
said
dick
recognizing
the
poor
fellow
tell
us
thomas
where
are
the
folk
of
dunwich
dead
dead
all
dead
he
wailed
and
fled
away
stay
what
of
master
de
cressi
called
hugh
but
the
tower
of
the
church
round
which
he
had
vanished
only
echoed
back
across
the
snow
what
of
master
de
cressi
then
at
last
hugh
understood
the
awful
truth
it
was
that
save
those
who
had
fled
the
people
of
dunwich
were
slain
with
the
sword
of
pestilence
and
all
his
kin
among
them
they
were
on
the
blythburgh
marshes
travelling
thither
by
the
shortest
road
the
moon
was
down
and
the
darkness
dense
for
the
hid
the
stars
let
us
bide
here
a
while
said
grey
dick
as
their
horses
blundered
through
the
thick
reeds
it
will
soon
be
sunrise
and
if
we
go
on
in
this
gloom
we
shall
fall
into
some
boghole
or
into
the
river
which
i
hear
running
on
our
so
they
halted
their
weary
horses
and
sat
still
for
in
his
wretchedness
hugh
cared
not
what
he
did
at
length
the
east
began
to
lighten
turning
the
sky
to
a
smoky
red
then
the
rim
of
the
sun
rising
out
of
the
ocean
threw
athwart
the
desolate
marsh
a
fierce
ray
that
lay
upon
the
snows
like
a
sword
of
blood
they
were
standing
on
the
crest
of
a
little
mound
and
dick
looking
about
him
knew
the
place
see
he
said
pointing
toward
the
river
that
ran
near
by
it
is
just
here
that
you
killed
young
clavering
this
day
two
years
ago
yonder
also
i
shot
the
french
knights
and
red
eve
and
you
leapt
into
the
blythe
and
swam
ay
said
hugh
looking
up
idly
but
did
you
say
two
years
dick
nay
surely
tis
a
score
why
he
added
in
a
changed
voice
who
may
that
be
in
the
hollow
and
he
pointed
to
a
tall
figure
which
stood
beneath
them
at
a
distance
by
the
dank
let
us
go
and
see
said
dick
speaking
almost
in
a
whisper
for
there
was
that
about
this
figure
which
sent
the
blood
to
his
throat
and
cheeks
he
drove
the
spurs
into
his
tired
horse
s
sides
causing
it
to
leap
forward
half
a
minute
later
they
had
ridden
down
the
slope
of
the
hollow
a
puff
of
wind
that
came
with
the
sun
drove
away
the
mist
dick
uttered
a
choking
cry
and
leapt
from
his
saddle
for
there
calm
terrible
mighty
clothed
in
his
red
and
yellow
cap
and
robe
of
ebon
furs
stood
he
who
was
named
murgh
the
fire
murgh
the
sword
murgh
the
helper
murgh
gateway
of
the
gods
they
knelt
before
him
in
the
snow
while
screaming
in
their
fright
the
horses
fled
away
knight
and
archer
said
murgh
in
his
icy
voice
counting
with
the
thumb
of
his
right
hand
upon
the
hidden
fingers
of
his
left
friends
you
keep
your
tryst
but
there
are
more
to
come
have
patience
there
are
more
to
then
he
became
quiet
nor
dared
they
ask
him
any
questions
only
at
a
motion
of
his
arm
they
rose
from
their
knees
and
stood
before
him
a
long
while
they
stood
thus
in
silence
till
under
murgh
s
dreadful
gaze
hugh
s
brain
began
to
swim
he
looked
about
him
seeking
some
natural
thing
to
feed
his
eyes
lo
yonder
was
that
which
he
might
watch
a
hare
crouching
in
its
form
not
ten
paces
distant
see
out
of
the
reeds
crept
a
great
red
fox
the
hare
smelt
or
saw
and
leaped
away
the
fox
sprang
at
it
too
late
for
the
white
fangs
closed
emptily
behind
its
scut
then
with
a
little
snarl
of
hungry
rage
it
turned
and
vanished
into
the
brake
the
hare
and
the
fox
the
dead
reeds
the
rising
sun
the
snow
oh
who
had
told
him
of
these
things
ah
he
remembered
now
and
that
memory
set
the
blood
pulsing
in
his
veins
for
where
these
creatures
were
should
be
more
besides
grey
dick
and
himself
and
the
man
of
many
names
he
looked
toward
murgh
to
see
that
he
had
bent
himself
and
with
his
gloved
hand
was
drawing
lines
upon
the
snow
those
lines
when
they
were
done
enclosed
the
shape
of
a
grave
archer
said
murgh
unsheath
your
axe
and
as
though
he
understood
dick
obeyed
and
began
to
hollow
out
a
grave
in
the
soft
and
boggy
soil
hugh
watched
him
like
one
who
dreams
wondering
who
was
destined
to
fill
that
grave
presently
a
sound
behind
caused
him
to
turn
his
head
oh
certainly
he
was
mad
for
there
over
the
rise
not
a
dozen
yards
away
came
the
beautiful
ghost
of
eve
clavering
clad
in
her
red
cloak
with
her
was
another
ghost
that
of
old
sir
andrew
arnold
blood
running
down
the
armour
beneath
his
robe
and
in
his
hand
the
hilt
of
a
broken
sword
hugh
tried
to
speak
but
his
lips
were
dumb
nor
did
these
ghosts
take
any
heed
of
him
for
their
eyes
were
fixed
elsewhere
to
murgh
they
went
and
stood
before
him
silent
for
a
while
he
looked
at
them
then
asked
in
his
cold
voice
who
am
i
eve
clavering
the
man
who
came
to
visit
me
in
my
dream
at
avignon
and
told
me
that
i
should
live
she
answered
slowly
and
who
say
you
that
i
am
andrew
arnold
priest
of
christ
the
god
he
whom
i
visited
in
my
youth
in
far
cathay
answered
the
old
knight
in
an
awed
whisper
he
who
sat
beside
the
pool
behind
the
doors
and
was
named
gateway
of
the
gods
he
who
showed
to
me
that
we
should
meet
again
in
such
a
place
and
hour
as
whence
come
you
now
priest
and
woman
and
why
we
come
from
avignon
we
fled
thence
from
one
who
would
have
done
this
maiden
grievous
wrong
he
followed
us
not
an
hour
gone
he
overtook
us
with
his
knaves
he
set
them
on
to
seize
this
woman
hanging
back
himself
old
as
i
am
i
slew
them
both
and
got
my
death
in
it
and
he
touched
the
great
wound
in
his
side
with
the
hilt
of
the
broken
sword
our
horses
were
the
better
we
fled
across
the
swamp
for
blythburgh
he
hunting
us
and
seeking
my
life
and
her
honour
thus
we
found
you
as
it
was
murgh
turned
his
eyes
following
their
glance
for
the
first
time
they
saw
hugh
de
cressi
and
near
him
grey
dick
labouring
at
the
grave
eve
stretched
out
her
arms
and
so
stood
with
head
thrown
back
the
light
of
the
daybreak
shining
in
her
lovely
eyes
and
on
her
outspread
hair
hugh
opened
his
lips
to
speak
but
murgh
lifted
his
hand
and
pointed
behind
them
they
turned
and
there
not
twenty
paces
from
them
clad
in
armour
and
seated
on
a
horse
was
edmund
acour
count
de
noyon
seigneur
of
cattrina
he
saw
then
wheeled
round
to
fly
archer
to
your
work
said
murgh
you
know
ere
the
words
had
left
his
lips
the
great
black
bow
was
bent
and
ere
the
echoes
died
away
the
horse
struck
in
its
side
by
the
keen
arrow
sank
dying
to
the
ground
then
murgh
beckoned
to
the
rider
and
he
came
as
a
man
who
must
but
throwing
down
the
bow
grey
dick
once
more
began
to
labour
at
the
grave
like
one
who
takes
no
further
heed
of
aught
save
his
allotted
task
acour
stood
before
murgh
like
a
criminal
before
his
judge
man
said
the
awful
figure
addressing
him
where
have
you
been
and
what
have
you
done
since
last
we
spoke
together
in
the
midday
dark
at
venice
now
dragged
word
by
slow
word
from
his
unwilling
lips
came
the
answer
of
the
traitor
s
heart
i
fled
from
the
field
at
venice
because
i
feared
this
knight
and
you
o
spirit
of
death
i
journeyed
to
avignon
in
france
and
there
strove
to
possess
myself
of
yonder
woman
whom
here
in
england
with
the
help
of
one
nicholas
i
had
wed
when
she
was
foully
drugged
i
strove
to
possess
myself
of
her
by
fraud
and
by
violence
but
some
fate
was
against
me
she
and
that
aged
priest
bribed
the
knave
whom
i
trusted
he
caused
a
dead
man
and
woman
dressed
in
their
garments
to
be
borne
from
their
lodging
to
the
plague
pit
while
they
fled
from
avignon
here
for
a
moment
grey
dick
paused
from
his
labours
at
the
grave
and
looked
up
at
hugh
then
he
fell
to
them
again
throwing
out
the
peaty
soil
with
both
hands
my
enemy
and
his
familiar
for
man
he
can
scarcely
be
went
on
acour
pointing
first
to
hugh
and
then
to
dick
survived
all
my
plans
to
kill
them
and
instead
killed
those
whom
i
had
sent
after
them
i
learned
that
the
woman
and
the
priest
were
not
dead
but
fled
and
followed
them
and
after
me
came
my
enemy
and
his
familiar
twice
we
passed
each
other
on
the
road
once
we
slept
in
the
same
house
i
knew
them
but
they
knew
me
not
and
the
fate
which
blinded
me
from
them
saved
them
also
from
all
my
plots
to
bring
them
to
their
doom
the
woman
and
the
priest
took
ship
to
england
and
i
followed
in
another
ship
being
made
mad
with
desire
and
with
jealous
rage
for
there
i
knew
my
enemy
would
find
and
win
her
in
the
darkness
before
this
very
dawn
i
overtook
the
woman
and
the
priest
at
last
and
set
my
fellows
on
to
kill
the
man
myself
i
would
strike
no
blow
fearing
lest
my
death
should
come
upon
me
and
so
i
should
be
robbed
of
her
but
god
fought
with
his
aged
servant
who
in
his
youth
was
the
first
of
knights
he
slew
my
men
then
fled
on
with
the
woman
eve
of
clavering
i
followed
knowing
that
he
was
sore
wounded
and
must
die
and
that
then
the
beauty
which
has
lured
me
to
shame
and
ruin
would
be
mine
if
only
for
an
hour
i
followed
and
here
at
this
place
of
evil
omen
where
first
i
saw
my
foe
i
found
o
incarnate
sword
of
murgh
unfolded
his
bare
arms
and
lifted
his
head
which
was
sunk
upon
his
breast
your
pardon
he
said
gently
my
name
is
hand
of
fate
and
not
sword
of
vengeance
there
is
no
vengeance
save
that
which
men
work
upon
themselves
what
fate
may
be
and
vengeance
may
be
i
know
not
fully
and
none
will
ever
know
until
they
have
passed
the
gateway
of
the
gods
archer
the
grave
is
deep
enough
come
forth
now
and
let
us
learn
who
it
is
decreed
shall
fill
it
knights
the
hour
is
at
hand
for
you
to
finish
that
which
you
began
at
crecy
and
at
hugh
heard
and
drew
his
sword
acour
drew
his
sword
also
then
cried
out
pointing
to
grey
dick
here
be
two
against
one
if
i
conquer
he
will
shoot
me
with
his
have
no
fear
sir
thief
and
liar
hissed
grey
dick
for
that
shaft
will
not
be
needed
slay
the
master
if
you
can
and
go
safe
from
the
squire
and
he
unstrung
his
black
bow
and
hid
it
in
its
case
now
hugh
stepped
to
where
red
eve
stood
the
wounded
sir
andrew
leaning
on
her
shoulder
bending
down
he
kissed
her
on
the
lips
saying
soon
very
soon
my
sweet
whom
i
have
lost
and
found
again
you
will
be
mine
on
earth
or
i
shall
be
yours
in
heaven
this
then
in
greeting
or
in
greeting
beloved
not
in
farewell
she
answered
as
she
kissed
him
back
for
if
you
die
know
that
i
follow
hard
upon
your
road
yet
i
say
that
yonder
grave
was
not
dug
for
nay
not
for
you
son
not
for
you
said
sir
andrew
lifting
his
faint
head
one
fights
for
you
whom
you
do
not
see
and
against
him
satan
and
his
servant
can
not
stand
and
letting
fall
the
sword
hilt
he
stretched
out
his
thin
hand
and
blessed
him
now
when
acour
saw
that
embrace
his
jealous
fury
prevailed
against
his
fears
with
a
curse
upon
his
lips
he
leapt
at
hugh
and
smote
thinking
to
take
him
unawares
but
hugh
was
watching
and
sprang
back
and
then
the
fray
began
if
fray
it
can
be
called
a
wild
joy
shining
in
his
eyes
hugh
grasped
his
long
sword
with
both
hands
and
struck
so
great
was
that
blow
that
it
bit
through
acour
s
armour
beneath
his
right
arm
deep
into
the
flesh
and
sent
him
staggering
back
again
he
struck
and
wounded
him
in
the
shoulder
a
third
time
and
clove
his
helm
so
that
the
blood
poured
down
into
his
eyes
and
blinded
him
back
reeled
acour
back
to
the
very
edge
of
the
grave
and
stood
there
swaying
to
and
fro
at
the
sight
of
his
helplessness
hugh
s
fury
seemed
to
leave
him
his
lifted
sword
sank
downward
let
god
deal
with
you
knave
he
said
for
i
can
not
for
a
while
there
was
silence
there
they
stood
and
stared
at
the
smitten
man
waiting
the
end
whatever
it
might
be
they
all
stared
save
murgh
who
fixed
his
stony
eyes
upon
the
sky
presently
it
came
the
sword
falling
from
acour
s
hand
into
the
grave
rested
there
point
upward
with
a
last
effort
he
drew
his
dagger
dashing
the
blood
from
his
eyes
he
hurled
it
with
all
his
dying
strength
not
at
hugh
but
at
red
eve
past
her
ear
it
hissed
severing
a
little
tress
of
her
long
hair
which
floated
down
on
to
the
snow
then
acour
threw
his
arms
wide
and
fell
backward
fell
backward
and
vanished
in
the
grave
dick
ran
to
look
there
he
lay
dead
pierced
through
back
and
bosom
by
the
point
of
his
own
sword
for
one
brief
flash
of
time
a
black
bird
was
seen
hovering
round
the
head
of
murgh
finished
said
dick
straightening
himself
well
i
had
hoped
to
see
a
better
fight
but
cowards
die
as
cowards
leaning
on
red
eve
s
shoulder
sir
andrew
limped
to
the
side
of
the
grave
they
both
looked
down
on
that
which
lay
therein
daughter
said
the
old
man
through
many
dangers
it
has
come
about
as
i
foretold
the
bond
that
in
your
drugged
sleep
bound
you
to
this
highborn
knave
is
severed
by
god
s
sword
of
death
christ
have
pity
on
his
sinful
soul
now
sir
hugh
de
cressi
come
hither
and
be
swift
for
my
time
is
hugh
obeyed
and
at
a
sign
took
eve
by
the
hand
then
speaking
very
low
and
as
quickly
as
he
might
for
all
his
life
was
draining
from
him
through
the
red
wound
in
his
side
the
old
priest
spoke
the
hallowed
words
that
bound
these
two
together
till
death
should
part
them
yes
there
by
the
graveside
over
the
body
of
the
dead
acour
there
in
the
red
light
of
the
morning
amidst
the
lonely
snows
was
celebrated
the
strangest
marriage
the
world
has
ever
seen
in
nature
s
church
it
was
celebrated
with
the
grim
grey
archer
for
a
clerk
and
death
s
own
fearful
minister
for
congregation
it
was
done
and
with
uplifted
trembling
hands
sir
andrew
blessed
them
both
them
and
the
fruit
of
their
bodies
which
was
to
be
he
blessed
them
in
the
name
of
the
god
he
served
he
bade
them
put
aside
their
grief
for
those
whom
they
had
lost
soon
he
said
their
short
day
done
the
lost
would
be
found
again
made
glorious
and
with
them
himself
who
loving
them
both
on
earth
would
love
them
through
eternity
then
while
their
eyes
grew
blind
with
tears
and
even
the
fierce
archer
turned
aside
his
face
sir
andrew
staggered
to
where
he
stood
who
in
the
land
of
sunrise
had
been
called
gateway
of
the
gods
before
him
he
bent
his
grey
and
ancient
head
o
thou
who
dwellest
here
below
to
do
the
will
of
heaven
to
thee
i
come
as
once
thou
badest
me
he
said
and
was
silent
murgh
let
his
eyes
rest
on
him
then
stretching
out
his
hand
he
touched
him
very
gently
on
the
breast
and
as
he
touched
him
smiled
a
sweet
and
wondrous
smile
good
and
faithful
servant
he
said
thy
work
is
done
on
earth
now
i
whom
all
men
fear
though
i
be
their
friend
and
helper
am
bidden
by
the
lord
of
life
and
death
to
call
thee
home
look
up
and
pass
the
old
priest
obeyed
it
seemed
to
those
who
watched
that
the
radiance
on
the
face
of
murgh
had
fallen
upon
him
also
he
smiled
he
stretched
his
arms
upward
as
though
to
clasp
what
they
might
not
see
then
down
he
sank
gently
as
though
upon
a
bed
and
lay
white
and
still
in
the
white
still
snow
the
helper
turned
to
the
three
who
remained
alive
farewell
for
a
little
time
he
said
i
must
be
gone
but
when
we
meet
again
as
meet
we
shall
then
fear
me
not
for
have
you
not
seen
that
to
those
who
love
me
i
am
gentle
hugh
de
cressi
and
red
eve
made
no
answer
for
they
knew
not
what
to
say
but
grey
dick
spoke
out
boldly
sir
lord
or
sir
spirit
he
said
save
once
at
the
beginning
when
the
arrow
burst
upon
my
string
i
never
feared
you
nor
do
i
fear
your
gifts
and
he
pointed
to
the
grave
and
to
dead
sir
andrew
which
of
late
have
been
plentiful
throughout
the
world
as
we
of
dunwich
know
therefore
i
dare
to
ask
you
one
question
ere
we
part
for
a
while
why
do
you
take
one
and
leave
another
is
it
because
you
must
or
because
every
shaft
does
not
hit
its
mark
now
murgh
looked
him
up
and
down
with
his
sunken
eyes
then
answered
come
hither
archer
and
i
will
lay
my
hand
upon
your
heart
also
and
you
shall
nay
cried
grey
dick
for
now
i
have
the
answer
to
the
riddle
since
i
know
you
can
not
lie
when
we
die
we
still
live
and
know
therefore
i
m
content
to
again
that
smile
swept
across
murgh
s
awful
face
though
that
smile
was
cold
as
the
winter
dawn
then
he
turned
and
slowly
walked
away
toward
the
west
they
watched
him
go
till
he
became
but
a
blot
of
fantastic
colour
that
soon
vanished
on
the
moorland
hugh
spoke
to
red
eve
and
said
wife
let
us
away
from
this
haunted
place
and
take
what
joy
we
can
who
knows
when
murgh
may
return
again
and
make
us
as
are
all
the
others
whom
we
love
ay
husband
won
at
last
she
answered
who
knows
yet
after
so
much
fear
and
sorrow
first
i
would
rest
a
while
with
so
hand
in
hand
they
went
till
they
too
grew
small
and
vanished
on
the
snowy
marsh
but
grey
dick
stayed
there
alone
with
the
dead
and
presently
spoke
aloud
for
company
the
woman
has
him
heart
and
soul
he
said
as
is
fitting
and
where
s
the
room
between
the
two
for
an
to
lodge
mayhap
after
all
i
should
have
done
well
to
take
yonder
murgh
for
lord
when
i
had
the
chance
man
or
god
or
ghost
he
s
a
fellow
to
my
liking
and
once
he
had
led
me
through
the
gates
no
woman
would
have
dared
to
come
to
part
us
well
hugh
de
cressi
till
you
are
sick
of
kisses
and
the
long
shafts
begin
to
fly
again
for
then
you
will
bethink
you
of
a
certain
bow
and
of
him
who
alone
can
bend
having
spoken
thus
in
his
hissing
voice
whereof
the
sound
resembled
that
of
an
arrow
in
its
flight
grey
dick
descended
into
the
grave
and
trod
the
earth
over
acour
s
false
and
handsome
face
hiding
it
from
the
sight
of
men
forever
then
he
lifted
up
the
dead
sir
andrew
in
his
strong
arms
and
slowly
bore
him
thence
to
burial
