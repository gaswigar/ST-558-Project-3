an
autobiography

london
second
edition
preface
it
is
a
difficult
thing
to
tell
the
story
of
a
life
and
yet
more
difficult
when
that
life
is
one
own
at
the
best
the
telling
has
a
savour
of
vanity
and
the
only
excuse
for
the
proceeding
is
that
the
life
being
an
average
one
reflects
many
others
and
in
troublous
times
like
ours
may
give
the
experience
of
many
rather
than
of
one
and
so
the
autobiographer
does
his
work
because
he
thinks
that
at
the
cost
of
some
unpleasantness
to
himself
he
may
throw
light
on
some
of
the
typical
problems
that
are
vexing
the
souls
of
his
contemporaries
and
perchance
may
stretch
out
a
helping
hand
to
some
brother
who
is
struggling
in
the
darkness
and
so
bring
him
cheer
when
despair
has
him
in
its
grip
since
all
of
us
men
and
women
of
this
restless
and
eager
generation
surrounded
by
forces
we
dimly
see
but
can
not
as
yet
understand
discontented
with
old
ideas
and
half
afraid
of
new
greedy
for
the
material
results
of
the
knowledge
brought
us
by
science
but
looking
askance
at
her
agnosticism
as
regards
the
soul
fearful
of
superstition
but
still
more
fearful
of
atheism
turning
from
the
husks
of
outgrown
creeds
but
filled
with
desperate
hunger
for
spiritual
ideals
since
all
of
us
have
the
same
anxieties
the
same
griefs
the
same
yearning
hopes
the
same
passionate
desire
for
knowledge
it
may
well
be
that
the
story
of
one
may
help
all
and
that
the
tale
of
one
should
that
went
out
alone
into
the
darkness
and
on
the
other
side
found
light
that
struggled
through
the
storm
and
on
the
other
side
found
peace
may
bring
some
ray
of
light
and
of
peace
into
the
darkness
and
the
storm
of
other
lives

out
of
the
everywhere
into
the
here
on
october
i
am
credibly
informed
my
baby
eyes
opened
to
the
light
of
a
london
afternoon
at
a
friendly
astrologer
has
drawn
for
me
the
following
chart
showing
the
position
of
the
planets
at
this
to
me
fateful
moment
but
i
know
nothing
of
astrology
so
feel
no
wiser
as
i
gaze
upon
my
horoscope
keeping
in
view
the
way
in
which
sun
moon
and
planets
influence
the
physical
condition
of
the
earth
there
is
nothing
incongruous
with
the
orderly
course
of
nature
in
the
view
that
they
also
influence
the
physical
bodies
of
men
these
being
part
of
the
physical
earth
and
largely
moulded
by
its
conditions
any
one
who
knows
the
characteristics
ascribed
to
those
who
are
born
under
the
several
signs
of
the
zodiac
may
very
easily
pick
out
the
different
types
among
his
own
acquaintances
and
he
may
then
get
them
to
go
to
some
astrologer
and
find
out
under
what
signs
they
were
severally
born
he
will
very
quickly
discover
that
two
men
of
completely
opposed
types
are
not
born
under
the
same
sign
and
the
invariability
of
the
concurrence
will
convince
him
that
law
and
not
chance
is
at
work
we
are
born
into
earthly
life
under
certain
conditions
just
as
we
were
physically
affected
by
them
and
these
will
have
their
bearing
on
our
subsequent
physical
evolution
at
the
most
astrology
as
it
is
now
practised
can
only
calculate
the
interaction
between
these
physical
conditions
at
any
given
moment
and
the
conditions
brought
to
them
by
a
given
person
whose
general
constitution
and
natal
condition
are
known
it
can
not
say
what
the
person
will
do
nor
what
will
happen
to
him
but
only
what
will
be
the
physical
district
so
to
speak
in
which
he
will
find
himself
and
the
impulses
that
will
play
upon
him
from
external
nature
and
from
his
own
body
even
on
those
matters
modern
astrology
is
not
quite
reliable
judging
from
the
many
blunders
made
or
else
its
professors
are
very
badly
instructed
but
that
there
is
a
real
science
of
astrology
i
have
no
doubt
and
there
are
some
men
who
are
past
masters
in
it
illustration
horoscope
of
annie
besant
it
has
always
been
somewhat
of
a
grievance
to
me
that
i
was
born
in
london
within
the
sound
of
bow
bells
when
of
my
blood
and
all
my
heart
are
irish
my
dear
mother
was
of
purest
irish
descent
and
my
father
was
irish
on
his
mother
side
though
belonging
to
the
devonshire
woods
on
his
father
the
woods
were
yeomen
of
the
sturdy
english
type
farming
their
own
land
in
honest
independent
fashion
of
late
years
they
seem
to
have
developed
more
in
the
direction
of
brains
from
the
time
in
fact
that
matthew
wood
became
mayor
of
london
town
fought
queen
caroline
battles
against
her
most
religious
and
gracious
royal
husband
aided
the
duke
of
kent
with
no
niggard
hand
and
received
a
baronetcy
for
his
services
from
the
duke
of
kent
royal
daughter
since
then
they
have
given
england
a
lord
chancellor
in
the
person
of
the
and
lord
hatherley
while
others
have
distinguished
themselves
in
various
ways
in
the
service
of
their
country
but
i
feel
playfully
inclined
to
grudge
the
english
blood
they
put
into
my
father
veins
with
his
irish
mother
his
galway
birth
and
his
trinity
college
dublin
education
for
the
irish
tongue
is
musical
in
my
ear
and
the
irish
nature
dear
to
my
heart
only
in
ireland
is
it
that
if
you
stop
to
ask
a
ragged
woman
the
way
to
some
old
monument
she
will
say
sure
then
my
darlin
it
just
up
the
hill
and
round
the
corner
and
then
any
one
will
tell
you
the
way
and
it
there
you
see
the
place
where
the
blessed
saint
patrick
set
his
foot
and
his
blessing
be
on
yer
old
women
as
poor
as
she
in
other
nations
would
never
be
as
bright
and
as
friendly
and
as
garrulous
and
where
out
of
ireland
will
you
see
a
whole
town
crowd
into
a
station
to
say
to
half
a
dozen
emigrants
till
the
platform
is
a
heaving
mass
of
men
and
women
struggling
climbing
over
each
other
for
a
last
kiss
crying
keening
laughing
all
in
a
breath
till
all
the
air
is
throbbing
and
there
a
lump
in
your
throat
and
tears
in
your
eyes
as
the
train
steams
out
where
out
of
ireland
will
you
be
bumping
along
the
streets
on
an
outside
car
beside
a
taciturn
jarvey
who
on
suddenly
discovering
that
you
are
shadowed
by
castle
spies
becomes
loquaciously
friendly
and
points
out
everything
that
he
thinks
will
interest
you
blessings
on
the
quick
tongues
and
warm
hearts
on
the
people
so
easy
to
lead
so
hard
to
drive
and
blessings
on
the
ancient
land
once
inhabited
by
mighty
men
of
wisdom
that
in
later
times
became
the
island
of
saints
and
shall
once
again
be
the
island
of
sages
when
the
wheel
turns
round
my
maternal
grandfather
was
a
typical
irishman
much
admired
by
me
and
somewhat
feared
also
in
the
childish
days
he
belonged
to
a
decayed
irish
family
the
maurices
and
in
a
gay
youth
with
a
beautiful
wife
as
as
himself
he
had
merrily
run
through
what
remained
to
him
in
the
way
of
fortune
in
his
old
age
with
abundant
hair
he
still
showed
the
hot
irish
blood
on
the
lightest
provocation
stormily
angry
for
a
moment
and
easily
appeased
my
mother
was
the
second
daughter
in
a
large
family
in
a
family
that
grew
more
numerous
as
pounds
grew
fewer
and
she
was
adopted
by
a
maiden
aunt
a
quaint
memory
of
whom
came
through
my
mother
childhood
into
mine
and
had
its
moulding
effect
on
both
our
characters
this
maiden
aunt
was
as
are
most
irish
folk
of
decayed
families
very
proud
of
her
family
tree
with
its
roots
in
the
inevitable
kings
her
particular
kings
were
the
seven
kings
of
france
the
milesian
kings
and
the
tree
grew
up
a
parchment
in
all
its
impressive
majesty
over
the
mantelpiece
of
their
descendant
modest
this
heraldic
monster
was
regarded
with
deep
respect
by
child
emily
a
respect
in
no
wise
deserved
i
venture
to
suppose
by
the
disreputable
royalties
of
whom
she
was
a
fortunately
distant
twig
chased
out
of
france
doubtless
for
cause
shown
they
had
come
over
the
sea
to
ireland
and
there
continued
their
reckless
plundering
lives
but
so
strangely
turns
the
wheel
of
time
that
these
and
barbarous
scamps
became
a
kind
of
moral
thermometer
in
the
home
of
the
gentle
irish
lady
in
the
early
half
of
the
present
century
for
my
mother
has
told
me
that
when
she
had
committed
some
act
of
childish
naughtiness
her
aunt
would
say
looking
gravely
over
her
spectacles
at
the
small
culprit
emily
your
conduct
is
unworthy
of
the
descendant
of
the
seven
kings
of
france
and
emily
with
her
sweet
grey
irish
eyes
and
her
curling
masses
of
raven
black
hair
would
cry
in
penitent
shame
over
her
unworthiness
with
some
vague
idea
that
those
royal
and
to
her
very
real
ancestors
would
despise
her
small
sweet
rosebud
self
so
wholly
unworthy
of
their
disreputable
majesties
thus
those
shadowy
forms
influenced
her
in
childhood
and
exercised
over
her
a
power
that
made
her
shrink
from
aught
that
was
unworthy
petty
or
mean
to
her
the
lightest
breath
of
dishonour
was
to
be
avoided
at
any
cost
of
pain
and
she
wrought
into
me
her
only
daughter
that
same
proud
and
passionate
horror
at
any
taint
of
shame
or
merited
disgrace
to
the
world
always
a
brave
front
was
to
be
kept
and
a
stainless
reputation
for
suffering
might
be
borne
but
dishonour
never
a
gentlewoman
might
starve
but
she
must
not
run
in
debt
she
might
break
her
heart
but
it
must
be
with
a
smile
on
her
face
i
have
often
thought
that
the
training
in
this
reticence
and
pride
of
honour
was
a
strange
preparation
for
my
stormy
public
much
attacked
and
slandered
life
and
certain
it
is
that
this
inwrought
shrinking
from
all
criticism
that
touched
personal
purity
and
personal
honour
added
a
keenness
of
suffering
to
the
fronting
of
public
odium
that
none
can
appreciate
who
has
not
been
trained
in
some
similar
school
of
dignified
and
yet
perhaps
there
was
another
result
from
it
that
in
value
outweighed
the
added
pain
it
was
the
stubbornly
resistant
feeling
that
rose
and
inwardly
asserted
its
own
purity
in
face
of
foulest
lie
and
turning
scornful
face
against
the
foe
too
proud
either
to
justify
itself
or
to
defend
said
to
itself
in
its
own
heart
when
condemnation
was
loudest
i
am
not
what
you
think
me
and
your
verdict
does
not
change
my
own
self
you
can
not
make
me
vile
whatever
you
think
of
me
and
i
will
never
in
my
own
eyes
be
that
which
you
deem
me
to
be
now
and
the
very
pride
became
a
shield
against
degradation
for
however
lost
my
public
reputation
i
could
never
bear
to
become
sullied
in
my
own
sight
and
that
is
a
thing
not
without
its
use
to
a
woman
cut
off
as
i
was
at
one
time
from
home
and
friends
and
society
so
peace
to
the
maiden
aunt
ashes
and
to
those
of
her
absurd
kings
for
i
owe
them
something
after
all
and
i
keep
grateful
memory
of
that
unknown
for
what
she
did
in
training
my
dear
mother
the
tenderest
sweetest
proudest
purest
of
women
it
is
well
to
be
able
to
look
back
to
a
mother
who
served
as
ideal
of
all
that
was
noblest
and
dearest
during
childhood
and
girlhood
whose
face
made
the
beauty
of
home
and
whose
love
was
both
sun
and
shield
no
other
experience
in
life
could
quite
make
up
for
missing
the
perfect
tie
between
mother
and
child
a
tie
that
in
our
case
never
relaxed
and
never
weakened
though
her
grief
at
my
change
of
faith
and
consequent
social
ostracism
did
much
to
hasten
her
it
never
brought
a
cloud
between
our
hearts
though
her
pleading
was
the
hardest
of
all
to
face
in
later
days
and
brought
the
bitterest
agony
it
made
no
gulf
between
us
it
cast
no
chill
upon
our
mutual
love
and
i
look
back
at
her
with
the
same
loving
gratitude
as
ever
encircled
her
to
me
in
her
earthly
life
i
have
never
met
a
woman
more
selflessly
devoted
to
those
she
loved
more
passionately
contemptuous
of
all
that
was
mean
or
base
more
keenly
sensitive
on
every
question
of
honour
more
iron
in
will
more
sweet
in
tenderness
than
the
mother
who
made
my
girlhood
sunny
as
dreamland
who
guarded
me
until
my
marriage
from
every
touch
of
pain
that
she
could
ward
off
or
bear
for
me
who
suffered
more
in
every
trouble
that
touched
me
in
later
life
than
i
did
myself
and
who
died
in
the
little
house
i
had
taken
for
our
new
home
in
norwood
worn
out
ere
old
age
touched
her
by
sorrow
poverty
and
pain
in
may
my
earliest
personal
recollections
are
of
a
house
and
garden
that
we
lived
in
when
i
was
three
and
four
years
of
age
situated
in
grove
road
john
wood
i
can
remember
my
mother
hovering
round
the
to
see
that
all
was
bright
for
the
husband
my
brother
two
years
older
than
myself
and
i
watching
for
papa
the
loving
welcome
the
game
of
romps
that
always
preceded
the
dinner
of
the
elder
folks
i
can
remember
on
the
of
october
jumping
up
in
my
little
cot
and
shouting
out
triumphantly
papa
mamma
i
am
four
years
old
and
the
grave
demand
of
my
brother
conscious
of
superior
age
at
may
not
annie
have
a
knife
as
she
is
four
years
old
it
was
a
sore
grievance
during
that
same
year
that
i
was
not
judged
old
enough
to
go
to
the
great
exhibition
and
i
have
a
faint
memory
of
my
brother
consolingly
bringing
me
home
one
of
those
folding
pictured
strips
that
are
sold
in
the
streets
on
which
were
imaged
glories
that
i
longed
only
the
more
to
see
dusky
trivial
memories
these
what
a
pity
it
is
that
a
baby
can
not
notice
can
not
observe
can
not
remember
and
so
throw
light
on
the
fashion
of
the
dawning
of
the
external
world
on
the
human
consciousness
if
only
we
could
remember
how
things
looked
when
they
were
first
imaged
on
the
retinae
what
we
felt
when
first
we
became
conscious
of
the
outer
world
what
the
feeling
was
as
faces
of
father
and
mother
grew
out
of
the
surrounding
chaos
and
became
familiar
things
greeted
with
a
smile
lost
with
a
cry
if
only
memory
would
not
become
a
mist
when
in
later
years
we
strive
to
throw
our
glances
backward
into
the
darkness
of
our
infancy
what
lessons
we
might
learn
to
help
our
stumbling
psychology
how
many
questions
might
be
solved
whose
answers
we
are
groping
for
in
the
west
in
vain
the
next
scene
that
stands
out
clearly
against
the
background
of
the
past
is
that
of
my
father
the
events
which
led
to
his
death
i
know
from
my
dear
mother
he
had
never
lost
his
fondness
for
the
profession
for
which
he
had
been
trained
and
having
many
medical
friends
he
would
now
and
then
accompany
them
on
their
hospital
rounds
or
share
with
them
the
labours
of
the
it
chanced
that
during
the
dissection
of
the
body
of
a
person
who
had
died
of
rapid
consumption
my
father
cut
his
finger
against
the
edge
of
the
the
cut
did
not
heal
easily
and
the
finger
became
swollen
and
inflamed
i
would
have
that
finger
off
wood
if
i
were
you
said
one
of
the
surgeons
a
day
or
two
afterwards
on
seeing
the
state
of
the
wound
but
the
others
laughed
at
the
suggestion
and
my
father
at
first
inclined
to
submit
to
the
amputation
was
persuaded
to
leave
nature
alone
about
the
middle
of
august
he
got
wet
through
riding
on
the
top
of
an
omnibus
and
the
wetting
resulted
in
a
severe
cold
which
settled
on
his
chest
one
of
the
most
eminent
doctors
of
the
day
as
able
as
he
was
rough
in
manner
was
called
to
see
him
he
examined
him
carefully
sounded
his
lungs
and
left
the
room
followed
by
my
mother
well
she
asked
scarcely
anxious
as
to
the
answer
save
as
it
might
worry
her
husband
to
be
kept
idly
at
home
you
must
keep
up
his
spirits
was
the
thoughtless
answer
he
is
in
a
galloping
consumption
you
will
not
have
him
with
you
six
weeks
longer
the
wife
staggered
back
and
fell
like
a
stone
on
the
floor
but
love
triumphed
over
agony
and
half
an
hour
later
she
was
again
at
her
husband
side
never
to
leave
it
again
for
ten
minutes
at
a
time
night
or
day
till
he
was
lying
with
closed
eyes
asleep
in
death
i
was
lifted
on
to
the
bed
to
say
to
dear
papa
on
the
day
before
his
death
and
i
remember
being
frightened
at
his
eyes
which
looked
so
large
and
his
voice
which
sounded
so
strange
as
he
made
me
promise
always
to
be
a
very
good
girl
to
darling
mamma
as
papa
was
going
right
away
i
remember
insisting
that
papa
should
kiss
cherry
a
doll
given
me
on
my
birthday
three
days
before
by
his
direction
and
being
removed
crying
and
struggling
from
the
room
he
died
on
the
following
day
october
and
i
do
not
think
that
my
elder
brother
and
i
who
were
staying
at
our
maternal
grandfather
went
to
the
house
again
until
the
day
of
the
funeral
with
the
death
my
mother
broke
down
and
when
all
was
over
they
carried
her
senseless
from
the
room
i
remember
hearing
afterwards
how
when
she
recovered
her
senses
she
passionately
insisted
on
being
left
alone
and
locked
herself
into
her
room
for
the
night
and
how
on
the
following
morning
her
mother
at
last
persuading
her
to
open
the
door
started
back
at
the
face
she
saw
with
the
cry
good
god
emily
your
hair
is
white
it
was
even
so
her
hair
black
glossy
and
abundant
which
contrasting
with
her
large
grey
eyes
had
made
her
face
so
strangely
attractive
had
turned
grey
in
that
night
of
agony
and
to
me
my
mother
face
is
ever
framed
in
exquisite
silver
bands
of
hair
as
white
as
the
driven
unsullied
snow
i
have
heard
that
the
love
between
my
father
and
mother
was
a
very
beautiful
thing
and
it
most
certainly
stamped
her
character
for
life
he
was
keenly
intellectual
and
splendidly
educated
a
mathematician
and
a
good
classical
scholar
thoroughly
master
of
french
german
italian
spanish
and
portuguese
with
a
smattering
of
hebrew
and
gaelic
the
treasures
of
ancient
and
of
modern
literature
were
his
daily
household
delight
nothing
pleased
him
so
well
as
to
sit
with
his
wife
reading
aloud
to
her
while
she
worked
now
translating
from
some
foreign
poet
now
rolling
forth
melodiously
the
exquisite
cadences
of
queen
mab
student
of
philosophy
as
he
was
he
was
deeply
and
steadily
sceptical
and
a
very
religious
relative
has
told
me
that
he
often
drove
her
from
the
room
by
his
light
playful
mockery
of
the
tenets
of
the
christian
faith
his
mother
and
sister
were
strict
roman
catholics
and
near
the
end
forced
a
priest
into
his
room
but
the
priest
was
promptly
ejected
by
the
wrath
of
the
dying
man
and
by
the
almost
fierce
resolve
of
the
wife
that
no
messenger
of
the
creed
he
detested
should
trouble
her
darling
at
the
last
deeply
read
in
philosophy
he
had
outgrown
the
orthodox
beliefs
of
his
day
and
his
wife
who
loved
him
too
much
to
criticise
was
wont
to
reconcile
her
own
piety
and
his
scepticism
by
holding
that
women
ought
to
be
religious
while
men
had
a
right
to
read
everything
and
think
as
they
would
provided
that
they
were
upright
and
honourable
in
their
lives
but
the
result
of
his
liberal
and
unorthodox
thought
was
to
insensibly
modify
and
partially
rationalise
her
own
beliefs
and
she
put
on
one
side
as
errors
the
doctrines
of
eternal
punishment
the
vicarious
atonement
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
the
equality
of
the
son
with
the
father
in
the
trinity
and
other
orthodox
beliefs
and
rejoiced
in
her
later
years
in
the
writings
of
such
men
as
jowett
colenso
and
stanley
the
last
named
indeed
was
her
ideal
christian
gentleman
suave
polished
devout
in
a
stately
way
the
baldness
of
a
typical
evangelical
service
outraged
her
taste
as
much
as
the
crudity
of
evangelical
dogmas
outraged
her
intellect
she
liked
to
feel
herself
a
christian
in
a
dignified
and
artistic
manner
and
to
be
surrounded
by
solemn
music
and
splendid
architecture
when
she
attended
divine
service
familiarity
with
celestial
personages
was
detestable
to
her
and
she
did
her
duty
of
saluting
them
in
a
courtly
and
reverent
fashion
westminster
abbey
was
her
favourite
church
with
its
dim
light
and
shadowy
distances
there
in
a
carven
stall
with
choristers
chanting
in
solemn
rhythm
with
the
glories
of
the
painted
windows
repeating
themselves
on
upspringing
arch
and
clustering
pillars
with
the
rich
harmonies
of
the
pealing
organ
throbbing
up
against
screen
and
monument
with
the
ashes
of
the
mighty
dead
around
and
all
the
stately
memories
of
the
past
inwrought
into
the
very
masonry
there
religion
appeared
to
her
to
be
intellectually
dignified
and
emotionally
satisfactory
to
me
who
took
my
religion
in
strenuous
fashion
this
dainty
and
piety
seemed
perilously
like
laodicean
lukewarmness
while
my
headlong
vigour
of
conviction
and
practice
often
jarred
on
her
as
alien
from
the
delicate
balance
and
absence
of
extremes
that
should
characterise
the
gentlewoman
she
was
of
the
old
i
of
the
stuff
from
which
fanatics
are
made
and
i
have
often
thought
in
looking
back
that
she
must
have
had
on
her
lips
many
a
time
unspoken
a
phrase
that
dropped
from
them
when
she
lay
my
little
one
you
have
never
made
me
sad
or
sorry
except
for
your
own
sake
you
have
always
been
too
religious
and
then
she
murmured
to
herself
yes
it
has
been
darling
annie
only
fault
she
has
always
been
too
religious
methinks
that
as
the
world
judges
the
dying
voice
spake
truly
and
the
dying
eyes
saw
with
a
real
insight
for
though
i
was
then
kneeling
beside
her
bed
heretic
and
outcast
the
heart
of
me
was
religious
in
its
very
fervour
of
repudiation
of
a
religion
and
in
its
rebellious
uprising
against
dogmas
that
crushed
the
reason
and
did
not
satisfy
the
soul
i
went
out
into
the
darkness
alone
not
because
religion
was
too
good
for
me
but
because
it
was
not
good
enough
it
was
too
meagre
too
commonplace
too
little
exacting
too
bound
up
with
earthly
interests
too
calculating
in
its
accommodations
to
social
conventionalities
the
roman
catholic
church
had
it
captured
me
as
it
nearly
did
would
have
sent
me
on
some
mission
of
danger
and
sacrifice
and
utilised
me
as
a
martyr
the
church
established
by
law
transformed
me
into
an
unbeliever
and
an
antagonist
for
as
a
child
i
was
mystical
and
imaginative
religious
to
the
very
and
with
a
certain
faculty
for
seeing
visions
and
dreaming
dreams
this
faculty
is
not
uncommon
with
the
keltic
races
and
makes
them
seem
superstitious
to
more
peoples
thus
on
the
day
of
my
father
funeral
my
mother
sat
with
vacant
eyes
and
fixed
pallid
face
the
picture
comes
back
to
me
yet
it
so
impressed
my
childish
imagination
following
the
funeral
service
stage
after
stage
and
suddenly
with
the
words
it
is
all
over
fell
back
fainting
she
said
afterwards
that
she
had
followed
the
hearse
had
attended
the
service
had
walked
behind
the
coffin
to
the
grave
certain
it
is
that
a
few
weeks
later
she
determined
to
go
to
the
kensal
green
cemetery
where
the
body
of
her
husband
had
been
laid
and
went
thither
with
a
relative
he
failed
to
find
the
grave
and
while
another
of
the
party
went
in
search
of
an
official
to
identify
the
spot
my
mother
said
if
you
will
take
me
to
the
chapel
where
the
first
part
of
the
service
was
read
i
will
find
the
grave
the
idea
seemed
to
her
friend
of
course
to
be
absurd
but
he
would
not
cross
the
widow
so
took
her
to
the
chapel
she
looked
round
left
the
chapel
door
and
followed
the
path
along
which
the
corpse
had
been
borne
till
she
reached
the
grave
where
she
was
quietly
standing
when
the
caretaker
arrived
to
point
it
out
the
grave
is
at
some
distance
from
the
chapel
and
is
not
on
one
of
the
main
roads
it
had
nothing
on
it
to
mark
it
save
the
wooden
peg
with
the
number
and
this
would
be
no
help
to
identification
at
a
distance
since
all
the
graves
are
thus
marked
and
at
a
little
way
off
these
pegs
are
not
visible
how
she
found
the
grave
remained
a
mystery
in
the
family
as
no
one
believed
her
straightforward
story
that
she
had
been
present
at
the
funeral
with
my
present
knowledge
the
matter
is
simple
enough
for
i
now
know
that
the
consciousness
can
leave
the
body
take
part
in
events
going
on
at
a
distance
and
returning
impress
on
the
physical
brain
what
it
has
experienced
the
very
fact
that
she
asked
to
be
taken
to
the
chapel
is
significant
showing
that
she
was
picking
up
a
memory
of
a
previous
going
from
that
spot
to
the
grave
she
could
only
find
the
grave
if
she
started
from
place
from
which
she
had
started
another
proof
of
this
capacity
was
given
a
few
months
later
when
her
infant
son
who
had
been
pining
himself
ill
for
papa
was
lying
one
night
in
her
arms
on
the
next
morning
she
said
to
her
sister
alf
is
going
to
die
the
child
had
no
definite
disease
but
was
wasting
away
and
it
was
argued
to
her
that
the
returning
spring
would
restore
the
health
lost
during
the
winter
no
was
her
answer
he
was
lying
asleep
in
my
arms
last
night
and
william
her
husband
came
to
me
and
said
that
he
wanted
alf
with
him
but
that
i
might
keep
the
other
two
in
vain
she
was
assured
that
she
had
been
dreaming
that
it
was
quite
natural
that
she
should
dream
about
her
husband
and
that
her
anxiety
for
the
child
had
given
the
dream
its
shape
nothing
would
persuade
her
that
she
had
not
seen
her
husband
or
that
the
information
he
had
given
her
was
not
true
so
it
was
no
matter
of
surprise
to
her
when
in
the
following
march
her
arms
were
empty
and
a
waxen
form
lay
lifeless
in
the
baby
cot
my
brother
and
i
were
allowed
to
see
him
just
before
he
was
placed
in
his
coffin
i
can
see
him
still
so
white
and
beautiful
with
a
black
spot
in
the
middle
of
the
fair
waxen
forehead
and
i
remember
the
deadly
cold
which
startled
me
when
i
was
told
to
kiss
my
little
brother
it
was
the
first
time
that
i
had
touched
death
that
black
spot
made
a
curious
impression
on
me
and
long
afterwards
asking
what
had
caused
it
i
was
told
that
at
the
moment
after
his
death
my
mother
had
passionately
kissed
the
baby
brow
pathetic
thought
that
the
mother
kiss
of
farewell
should
have
been
marked
by
the
first
sign
of
corruption
on
the
child
face
i
do
not
mention
these
stories
because
they
are
in
any
fashion
remarkable
or
out
of
the
way
but
only
to
show
that
the
sensitiveness
to
impressions
other
than
physical
ones
that
was
a
marked
feature
in
my
own
childhood
was
present
also
in
the
family
to
which
i
belonged
for
the
physical
nature
is
inherited
from
parents
and
sensitiveness
to
psychic
impressions
is
a
property
of
the
physical
body
in
our
family
as
in
so
many
irish
ones
belief
in
ghosts
of
all
descriptions
was
general
and
my
mother
has
told
me
of
the
banshee
that
she
had
heard
wailing
when
the
of
one
of
the
family
was
near
to
me
in
my
childhood
elves
and
fairies
of
all
sorts
were
very
real
things
and
my
dolls
were
as
really
children
as
i
was
myself
a
child
punch
and
judy
were
living
entities
and
the
tragedy
in
which
they
bore
part
cost
me
many
an
agony
of
tears
to
this
day
i
can
remember
running
away
when
i
heard
the
squawk
of
the
coming
punch
and
burying
my
head
in
the
pillows
that
i
might
shut
out
the
sound
of
the
blows
and
the
cry
of
the
baby
all
the
objects
about
me
were
to
me
alive
the
flowers
that
i
kissed
as
much
as
the
kitten
i
petted
and
i
used
to
have
a
splendid
time
making
believe
and
living
out
all
sorts
of
lovely
stories
among
my
treasured
and
inanimate
playthings
but
there
was
a
more
serious
side
to
this
dreamful
fancy
when
it
joined
hands
with
religion
chapter
ii
early
childhood
and
now
began
my
mother
time
of
struggle
and
of
anxiety
hitherto
since
her
marriage
she
had
known
no
money
troubles
for
her
husband
was
earning
a
good
income
he
was
apparently
vigorous
and
well
no
thought
of
anxiety
clouded
their
future
when
he
died
he
believed
that
he
left
his
wife
and
children
safe
at
least
from
pecuniary
distress
it
was
not
so
i
know
nothing
of
the
details
but
the
outcome
of
all
was
that
nothing
was
left
for
the
widow
and
children
save
a
trifle
of
ready
money
the
resolve
to
which
my
mother
came
was
characteristic
two
of
her
husband
relatives
western
and
sir
william
wood
offered
to
educate
her
son
at
a
good
city
school
and
to
start
him
in
commercial
life
using
their
great
city
influence
to
push
him
forward
but
the
young
lad
father
and
mother
had
talked
of
a
different
future
for
their
eldest
boy
he
was
to
go
to
a
public
school
and
then
to
the
university
and
was
to
enter
one
of
the
learned
professions
to
take
orders
the
mother
wished
to
go
to
the
bar
the
father
hoped
on
his
there
was
nothing
more
earnestly
urged
by
my
father
than
that
harry
should
receive
the
best
possible
education
and
the
widow
was
resolute
to
fulfil
that
last
wish
in
her
eyes
a
city
school
was
not
the
best
possible
education
and
the
irish
pride
rebelled
against
the
idea
of
her
son
not
being
a
university
man
many
were
the
lectures
poured
out
on
the
young
widow
head
about
her
foolish
pride
especially
by
the
female
members
of
the
wood
family
and
her
persistence
in
her
own
way
caused
a
considerable
alienation
between
herself
and
them
but
western
and
william
though
remained
her
friends
and
lent
many
a
helping
hand
to
her
in
her
first
difficult
struggles
after
much
cogitation
she
resolved
that
the
boy
should
be
educated
at
harrow
where
the
fees
are
comparatively
low
to
lads
living
in
the
town
and
that
he
should
go
thence
to
cambridge
or
to
oxford
as
his
tastes
should
direct
a
bold
scheme
for
a
penniless
widow
but
carried
out
to
the
letter
for
never
dwelt
in
a
delicate
body
a
more
resolute
mind
and
will
than
that
of
my
dear
mother
in
a
few
months
time
during
which
we
lived
poorly
enough
in
richmond
terrace
clapham
close
to
her
father
and
mother
to
harrow
then
she
betook
herself
into
lodgings
over
a
grocer
shop
and
set
herself
to
look
for
a
house
this
grocer
was
a
very
pompous
man
fond
of
long
words
and
patronised
the
young
widow
exceedingly
and
one
day
my
mother
related
with
much
amusement
how
he
had
told
her
that
she
was
sure
to
get
on
if
she
worked
hard
look
at
me
he
said
swelling
visibly
with
importance
i
was
once
a
poor
boy
without
a
penny
of
my
own
and
now
i
am
a
comfortable
man
and
have
my
submarine
villa
to
go
to
every
evening
that
submarine
villa
was
an
object
of
amusement
when
we
passed
it
in
our
walks
for
many
a
long
day
there
is
submarine
villa
some
one
would
say
laughing
and
i
too
used
to
laugh
merrily
because
my
elders
did
though
my
understanding
of
the
difference
between
suburban
and
submarine
was
on
a
par
with
that
of
the
honest
grocer
my
mother
had
fortunately
found
a
boy
whose
parents
were
glad
to
place
him
in
her
charge
of
about
the
age
of
her
own
son
to
educate
with
him
and
by
this
means
she
was
able
to
pay
for
a
tutor
to
prepare
the
two
boys
for
school
the
tutor
had
a
cork
leg
which
was
a
source
of
serious
trouble
to
me
for
it
stuck
out
straight
behind
when
we
knelt
down
to
family
prayers
conduct
which
struck
me
as
irreverent
and
unbecoming
but
which
i
always
felt
a
desire
to
imitate
after
about
a
year
my
mother
found
a
house
which
she
thought
would
suit
her
scheme
namely
to
obtain
permission
from
vaughan
the
then
of
harrow
to
take
some
boys
into
her
house
and
so
gain
means
of
education
for
her
own
son
vaughan
who
must
have
been
won
by
the
gentle
strong
little
woman
from
that
time
forth
became
her
earnest
friend
and
helper
and
to
the
counsel
and
active
assistance
both
of
himself
and
of
his
wife
was
due
much
of
the
success
that
crowned
her
toil
he
made
only
one
condition
in
granting
the
permission
she
asked
and
that
was
that
she
should
also
have
in
her
house
one
of
the
masters
of
the
school
so
that
the
boys
should
not
suffer
from
the
want
of
a
this
condition
of
course
she
readily
accepted
and
the
arrangement
lasted
for
ten
years
until
after
her
son
had
left
school
for
cambridge
the
house
she
took
is
now
i
am
sorry
to
say
pulled
down
and
replaced
by
a
hideous
structure
it
was
very
old
and
rambling
in
front
behind
it
stood
on
the
top
of
harrow
hill
between
the
church
and
the
school
and
had
once
been
the
vicarage
of
the
parish
but
the
vicar
had
left
it
because
it
was
so
far
removed
from
the
part
of
the
village
where
all
his
work
lay
the
opened
by
an
which
proved
a
constant
source
of
grief
to
me
for
whenever
i
had
on
a
new
frock
i
always
tore
it
on
the
bolt
as
i
flew
through
into
a
large
garden
which
sloped
down
one
side
of
the
hill
and
was
filled
with
the
most
delightful
old
trees
fir
and
laurel
may
mulberry
hazel
apple
pear
and
damson
not
to
mention
currant
and
gooseberry
bushes
innumerable
and
large
strawberry
beds
spreading
down
the
sunny
slopes
there
was
not
a
tree
there
that
i
did
not
climb
and
one
a
widespreading
portugal
laurel
was
my
private
country
house
i
had
there
my
bedroom
and
my
my
study
and
my
larder
the
larder
was
supplied
by
the
from
which
i
was
free
to
pick
as
i
would
and
in
the
study
i
would
sit
for
hours
with
some
favourite
book
milton
paradise
lost
the
chief
favourite
of
all
the
birds
must
often
have
felt
startled
when
from
the
small
swinging
form
perching
on
a
branch
came
out
in
childish
tones
the
thrones
dominations
princedoms
virtues
powers
of
stately
and
sonorous
verse
i
liked
to
personify
satan
and
to
declaim
the
grand
speeches
of
the
and
many
a
happy
hour
did
i
pass
in
milton
heaven
and
hell
with
for
companions
satan
and
the
son
gabriel
and
abdiel
then
there
was
a
terrace
running
by
the
side
of
the
churchyard
always
dry
in
the
wettest
weather
and
bordered
by
an
old
wooden
fence
over
which
clambered
roses
of
every
shade
never
was
such
a
garden
for
roses
as
that
of
the
old
vicarage
at
the
end
of
the
terrace
was
a
little
and
in
this
a
in
the
fence
which
swung
open
and
displayed
one
of
the
fairest
views
in
england
sheer
from
your
feet
downwards
went
the
hill
and
then
far
below
stretched
the
wooded
country
till
your
eye
reached
the
towers
of
windsor
castle
far
away
on
the
horizon
it
was
the
view
at
which
byron
was
never
tired
of
gazing
as
he
lay
on
the
flat
tombstone
close
by
byron
tomb
as
it
is
still
called
of
which
he
wrote
again
i
behold
where
for
hours
i
have
pondered
as
reclining
at
eve
on
yon
tombstone
i
lay
or
round
the
steep
brow
of
the
churchyard
i
wandered
to
catch
the
last
gleam
of
the
sun
setting
ray
reader
mine
if
ever
you
go
to
harrow
ask
permission
to
enter
the
old
garden
and
try
the
effect
of
that
sudden
burst
of
beauty
as
you
swing
back
the
small
at
the
terrace
end
into
this
house
we
moved
on
my
eighth
birthday
and
for
eleven
years
it
was
home
to
me
left
always
with
regret
returned
to
always
with
joy
almost
immediately
afterwards
i
left
my
mother
for
the
first
time
for
one
day
visiting
a
family
who
lived
close
by
i
found
a
stranger
sitting
in
the
a
lame
lady
with
a
strong
face
which
softened
marvellously
as
she
smiled
at
the
child
who
came
dancing
in
she
called
me
to
her
presently
and
took
me
on
her
lap
and
talked
to
me
and
on
the
following
day
our
friend
came
to
see
my
mother
to
ask
if
she
would
let
me
go
away
and
be
educated
with
this
lady
niece
coming
home
for
the
holidays
regularly
but
leaving
my
education
in
her
hands
at
first
my
mother
would
not
hear
of
it
for
she
and
i
scarcely
ever
left
each
other
my
love
for
her
was
an
idolatry
hers
for
me
a
devotion
a
foolish
little
story
about
which
i
was
unmercifully
teased
for
years
marked
that
absolute
idolatry
of
her
which
has
not
yet
faded
from
my
heart
in
tenderest
rallying
one
day
of
the
child
who
trotted
after
her
everywhere
content
to
sit
or
stand
or
wait
if
only
she
might
touch
hand
or
dress
of
mamma
she
said
little
one
the
name
by
which
she
always
called
me
if
you
cling
to
mamma
in
this
way
i
must
really
get
a
string
and
tie
you
to
my
apron
and
how
will
you
like
that
o
mamma
darling
came
the
fervent
answer
do
let
it
be
in
a
knot
and
indeed
the
tie
of
love
between
us
was
so
tightly
knotted
that
nothing
ever
loosened
it
till
the
sword
of
death
cut
that
which
pain
and
trouble
never
availed
to
slacken
in
the
slightest
degree
but
it
was
urged
upon
her
that
the
advantages
of
education
offered
were
such
as
no
money
could
purchase
for
me
that
it
would
be
a
disadvantage
for
me
to
grow
up
in
a
houseful
of
boys
and
in
truth
i
was
as
good
a
cricketer
and
climber
as
the
best
of
them
that
my
mother
would
soon
be
obliged
to
send
me
to
school
unless
she
accepted
an
offer
which
gave
me
every
advantage
of
school
without
its
disadvantages
at
last
she
yielded
and
it
was
decided
that
miss
marryat
on
returning
home
should
take
me
with
her
miss
marryat
the
favourite
sister
of
captain
marryat
the
famous
novelist
was
a
maiden
lady
of
large
means
she
had
nursed
her
brother
through
the
illness
that
ended
in
his
death
and
had
been
living
with
her
mother
at
wimbledon
park
on
her
mother
death
she
looked
round
for
work
which
would
make
her
useful
in
the
world
and
finding
that
one
of
her
brothers
had
a
large
family
of
girls
she
offered
to
take
charge
of
one
of
them
and
to
educate
her
thoroughly
chancing
to
come
to
harrow
my
good
fortune
threw
me
in
her
way
and
she
took
a
fancy
to
me
and
thought
she
would
like
to
teach
two
little
girls
rather
than
one
hence
her
offer
to
my
mother
miss
marryat
had
a
perfect
genius
for
teaching
and
took
in
it
the
greatest
delight
from
time
to
time
she
added
another
child
to
our
party
sometimes
a
boy
sometimes
a
girl
at
first
with
amy
marryat
and
myself
there
was
a
little
boy
walter
powys
son
of
a
clergyman
with
a
large
family
and
him
she
trained
for
some
years
and
then
sent
him
on
to
school
admirably
prepared
she
chose
her
children
as
she
loved
to
call
us
in
very
definite
fashion
each
must
be
gently
born
and
gently
trained
but
in
such
position
that
the
education
freely
given
should
be
a
relief
and
aid
to
a
slender
parental
purse
it
was
her
delight
to
seek
out
and
aid
those
on
whom
poverty
presses
most
heavily
when
the
need
for
education
for
the
children
weighs
on
the
proud
and
the
poor
auntie
we
all
called
her
for
she
thought
miss
marryat
seemed
too
cold
and
stiff
she
taught
us
everything
herself
except
music
and
for
this
she
had
a
master
practising
us
in
composition
in
recitation
in
reading
aloud
english
and
french
and
later
german
devoting
herself
to
training
us
in
the
soundest
most
thorough
fashion
no
words
of
mine
can
tell
how
much
i
owe
her
not
only
of
knowledge
but
of
that
love
of
knowledge
which
has
remained
with
me
ever
since
as
a
constant
spur
to
study
her
method
of
teaching
may
be
of
interest
to
some
who
desire
to
train
children
with
least
pain
and
the
most
enjoyment
to
the
little
ones
themselves
first
we
never
used
a
that
torment
of
the
small
child
nor
an
english
grammar
but
we
wrote
letters
telling
of
the
things
we
had
seen
in
our
walks
or
told
again
some
story
we
had
read
these
childish
compositions
she
would
read
over
with
us
correcting
all
faults
of
spelling
of
grammar
of
style
of
cadence
a
clumsy
sentence
would
be
read
aloud
that
we
might
hear
how
unmusical
it
sounded
an
error
in
observation
or
expression
pointed
out
then
as
the
letters
recorded
what
we
had
seen
the
day
before
the
faculty
of
observation
was
drawn
out
and
trained
oh
dear
i
have
nothing
to
say
would
come
from
a
small
child
hanging
over
a
slate
did
you
not
go
out
for
a
walk
yesterday
auntie
would
question
yes
would
be
sighed
out
but
there
nothing
to
say
about
it
nothing
to
say
and
you
walked
in
the
lanes
for
an
hour
and
saw
nothing
little
you
must
use
your
eyes
better
then
there
was
a
very
favourite
lesson
which
proved
an
excellent
way
of
teaching
spelling
we
used
to
write
out
lists
of
all
the
words
we
could
think
of
which
sounded
the
same
but
were
differently
spelt
thus
key
quay
knight
night
and
so
on
and
great
was
the
glory
of
the
child
who
found
the
largest
number
our
french
lessons
as
the
german
later
included
reading
from
the
very
first
on
the
day
on
which
we
began
german
we
began
reading
schiller
wilhelm
tell
and
the
verbs
given
to
us
to
copy
out
were
those
that
had
occurred
in
the
reading
we
learned
much
by
heart
but
always
things
that
in
themselves
were
worthy
to
be
learned
we
were
never
given
the
dry
questions
and
answers
which
lazy
teachers
so
much
affect
we
were
taught
history
by
one
reading
aloud
while
the
others
worked
the
boys
as
well
as
the
girls
learning
the
use
of
the
needle
it
like
a
girl
to
sew
said
a
little
fellow
indignantly
one
day
it
is
like
a
baby
to
have
to
run
after
a
girl
if
you
want
a
button
sewn
on
quoth
auntie
geography
was
learned
by
painting
skeleton
maps
an
exercise
much
delighted
in
by
small
fingers
and
by
putting
together
puzzle
maps
in
which
countries
in
the
map
of
a
continent
or
counties
in
the
map
of
a
country
were
always
cut
out
in
their
proper
shapes
i
liked
big
empires
in
those
days
there
was
a
solid
satisfaction
in
putting
down
russia
and
seeing
what
a
large
part
of
the
map
was
filled
up
thereby
the
only
grammar
that
we
ever
learned
as
grammar
was
the
latin
and
that
not
until
composition
had
made
us
familiar
with
the
use
of
the
rules
therein
given
auntie
had
a
great
horror
of
children
learning
by
rote
things
they
did
not
understand
and
then
fancying
they
knew
them
what
do
you
mean
by
that
expression
annie
she
would
ask
me
after
feeble
attempts
to
explain
i
would
answer
indeed
auntie
i
know
in
my
own
head
but
i
ca
explain
then
indeed
annie
you
do
not
know
in
your
own
head
or
you
could
explain
so
that
i
might
know
in
my
own
head
and
so
a
healthy
habit
was
fostered
of
clearness
of
thought
and
of
expression
the
latin
grammar
was
used
because
it
was
more
perfect
than
the
modern
grammars
and
served
as
a
solid
foundation
for
modern
languages
miss
marryat
took
a
beautiful
place
fern
hill
near
charmouth
in
dorsetshire
on
the
borders
of
devon
and
there
she
lived
for
some
five
years
a
centre
of
beneficence
in
the
district
she
started
a
sunday
school
and
a
bible
class
after
awhile
for
the
lads
too
old
for
the
school
who
clamoured
for
admission
to
her
class
in
it
she
visited
the
poor
taking
help
wherever
she
went
and
sending
food
from
her
own
table
to
the
sick
it
was
characteristic
of
her
that
she
would
never
give
scraps
to
the
poor
but
would
have
a
basin
brought
in
at
dinner
and
would
cut
the
best
slice
to
tempt
the
invalid
appetite
money
she
rarely
if
ever
gave
but
she
would
find
a
day
work
or
busy
herself
to
seek
permanent
employment
for
any
one
seeking
aid
stern
in
rectitude
herself
and
iron
to
the
fawning
or
the
dishonest
her
influence
whether
she
was
feared
or
loved
was
always
for
good
of
the
strictest
sect
of
the
evangelicals
she
was
an
evangelical
on
the
sunday
no
books
were
allowed
save
the
bible
or
the
sunday
at
home
but
she
would
try
to
make
the
day
bright
by
various
little
devices
by
a
walk
with
her
in
the
garden
by
the
singing
of
hymns
always
attractive
to
children
by
telling
us
wonderful
missionary
stories
of
moffat
and
livingstone
whose
adventures
with
savages
and
wild
beasts
were
as
exciting
as
any
tale
of
mayne
reid
we
used
to
learn
passages
from
the
bible
and
hymns
for
repetition
a
favourite
amusement
was
a
bible
puzzle
such
as
a
description
of
some
bible
scene
which
was
to
be
recognised
by
the
description
then
we
taught
in
the
sunday
school
for
auntie
would
tell
us
that
it
was
useless
for
us
to
learn
if
we
did
not
try
to
help
those
who
had
no
one
to
teach
them
the
lessons
had
to
be
carefully
prepared
on
the
saturday
for
we
were
always
taught
that
work
given
to
the
poor
should
be
work
that
cost
something
to
the
giver
this
principle
regarded
by
her
as
an
illustration
of
the
text
shall
i
give
unto
the
lord
my
god
that
which
has
cost
me
nothing
ran
through
all
her
precept
and
her
practice
when
in
some
public
distress
we
children
went
to
her
crying
and
asking
whether
we
could
not
help
the
little
children
who
were
starving
her
prompt
reply
was
what
will
you
give
up
for
them
and
then
she
said
that
if
we
liked
to
give
up
the
use
of
sugar
we
might
thus
each
save
sixpence
a
week
to
give
away
i
doubt
if
a
healthier
lesson
can
be
given
to
children
than
that
of
personal
for
the
good
of
others
daily
when
our
lessons
were
over
we
had
plenty
of
fun
long
walks
and
rides
rides
on
a
lovely
pony
who
found
small
children
most
amusing
and
on
which
the
coachman
taught
us
to
stick
firmly
whatever
his
eccentricities
of
the
moment
delightful
picnics
in
the
lovely
country
round
charmouth
auntie
our
merriest
playfellow
never
was
a
healthier
home
physically
and
mentally
made
for
young
things
than
in
that
quiet
village
and
then
the
delight
of
the
holidays
the
pride
of
my
mother
at
the
good
report
of
her
darling
progress
and
the
renewal
of
acquaintance
with
every
nook
and
corner
in
the
dear
old
house
and
garden
the
dreamy
tendency
in
the
child
that
on
its
worldly
side
is
fancy
imagination
on
its
religious
side
is
the
germ
of
mysticism
and
i
believe
it
to
be
far
more
common
than
many
people
think
but
the
remorseless
materialism
of
the
day
not
the
philosophic
materialism
of
the
few
but
the
religious
materialism
of
the
many
crushes
out
all
the
delicate
buddings
forth
of
the
childish
thought
and
bandages
the
eyes
that
might
otherwise
see
at
first
the
child
does
not
distinguish
between
what
it
sees
and
what
it
fancies
the
one
is
as
real
as
objective
to
it
as
the
other
and
it
will
talk
to
and
play
with
its
as
merrily
as
with
children
like
itself
as
a
child
i
myself
very
much
preferred
the
former
and
never
knew
what
it
was
to
be
lonely
but
clumsy
come
along
and
tramp
right
through
the
and
crush
the
and
push
the
aside
and
then
say
in
their
loud
harsh
voices
not
soft
and
singable
like
the
you
must
not
tell
such
naughty
stories
miss
annie
you
give
me
the
shivers
and
your
mamma
will
be
very
vexed
with
you
but
this
tendency
in
me
was
too
strong
to
be
stifled
and
it
found
its
food
in
the
fairy
tales
i
loved
and
in
the
religious
allegories
that
i
found
yet
more
entrancing
how
or
when
i
learned
to
read
i
do
not
know
for
i
can
not
remember
the
time
when
a
book
was
not
a
delight
at
five
years
of
age
i
must
have
read
easily
for
i
remember
being
often
unswathed
from
a
delightful
curtain
in
which
i
used
to
roll
myself
with
a
book
and
told
to
go
and
play
while
i
was
still
a
dot
and
i
had
a
habit
of
losing
myself
so
completely
in
the
book
that
my
name
might
be
called
in
the
room
where
i
was
and
i
never
hear
it
so
that
i
used
to
be
blamed
for
wilfully
hiding
myself
when
i
had
simply
been
away
in
fairyland
or
lying
trembling
beneath
some
friendly
as
a
giant
went
by
i
was
between
seven
and
eight
years
of
age
when
i
first
came
across
some
children
allegories
of
a
religious
kind
and
a
very
little
later
came
pilgrim
progress
and
milton
paradise
lost
thenceforth
my
busy
fancies
carried
me
ever
into
the
fascinating
world
where
kept
some
outpost
for
their
absent
prince
bearing
a
shield
with
his
sign
of
a
red
cross
on
it
where
devils
shaped
as
dragons
came
swooping
down
on
the
pilgrim
but
were
driven
away
defeated
after
hard
struggle
where
angels
came
and
talked
with
little
children
and
gave
them
some
talisman
which
warned
them
of
coming
danger
and
lost
its
light
if
they
were
leaving
the
right
path
what
a
dull
world
it
was
that
i
had
to
live
in
i
used
to
think
to
myself
when
i
was
told
to
be
a
good
child
and
not
to
lose
my
temper
and
to
be
tidy
and
not
mess
my
pinafore
at
dinner
how
much
easier
to
be
a
christian
if
one
could
have
a
shield
and
a
white
banner
and
have
a
real
devil
to
fight
with
and
a
beautiful
divine
prince
to
smile
at
you
when
the
battle
was
over
how
much
more
exciting
to
struggle
with
a
winged
and
clawed
dragon
that
you
knew
meant
mischief
than
to
look
after
your
temper
that
you
never
remembered
you
ought
to
keep
until
you
had
lost
it
if
i
had
been
eve
in
the
garden
that
old
serpent
would
never
have
got
the
better
of
me
but
how
was
a
little
girl
to
know
that
she
might
not
pick
out
the
rosiest
prettiest
apple
from
a
tree
that
had
no
serpent
to
show
it
was
a
forbidden
one
and
as
i
grew
older
the
dreams
and
fancies
grew
less
fantastic
but
more
tinged
with
real
enthusiasm
i
read
tales
of
the
early
christian
martyrs
and
passionately
regretted
i
was
born
so
late
when
no
suffering
for
religion
was
practicable
i
would
spend
many
an
hour
in
daydreams
in
which
i
stood
before
roman
judges
before
dominican
inquisitors
was
flung
to
lions
tortured
on
the
rack
burned
at
the
stake
one
day
i
saw
myself
preaching
some
great
new
faith
to
a
vast
crowd
of
people
and
they
listened
and
were
converted
and
i
became
a
great
religious
leader
but
always
with
a
shock
i
was
brought
back
to
earth
where
there
were
no
heroic
deeds
to
do
no
lions
to
face
no
judges
to
defy
but
only
some
dull
duty
to
be
performed
and
i
used
to
fret
that
i
was
born
so
late
when
all
the
grand
things
had
been
done
and
when
there
was
no
chance
of
preaching
and
suffering
for
a
new
religion
from
the
age
of
eight
my
education
accented
the
religious
side
of
my
character
under
miss
marryat
training
my
religious
feeling
received
a
strongly
evangelical
bent
but
it
was
a
subject
of
some
distress
to
me
that
i
could
never
look
back
to
an
hour
of
conversion
when
others
gave
their
experiences
and
spoke
of
the
sudden
change
they
had
felt
i
used
to
be
sadly
conscious
that
no
such
change
had
occurred
in
me
and
i
felt
that
my
dreamy
longings
were
very
poor
things
compared
with
the
vigorous
sense
of
sin
spoken
of
by
the
preachers
and
used
dolefully
to
wonder
if
i
were
saved
then
i
had
an
uneasy
sense
that
i
was
often
praised
for
my
piety
when
emulation
and
vanity
were
more
to
the
front
than
religion
as
when
i
learned
by
heart
the
epistle
of
james
far
more
to
distinguish
myself
for
my
good
memory
than
from
any
love
of
the
text
itself
the
sonorous
cadences
of
many
parts
of
the
old
and
new
testaments
pleased
my
ear
and
i
took
a
dreamy
pleasure
in
repeating
them
aloud
just
as
i
would
recite
for
my
own
amusement
hundreds
of
lines
of
milton
paradise
lost
as
i
sat
swinging
on
some
branch
of
a
tree
lying
back
often
on
some
swaying
bough
and
gazing
into
the
unfathomable
blue
of
the
sky
till
i
lost
myself
in
an
ecstasy
of
sound
and
colour
half
chanting
the
melodious
sentences
and
peopling
all
the
blue
with
misty
forms
this
facility
of
learning
by
heart
and
the
habit
of
dreamy
recitation
made
me
very
familiar
with
the
bible
and
very
apt
with
its
phrases
this
stood
me
in
good
stead
at
the
dear
to
the
evangelical
in
which
we
all
took
part
in
turn
we
were
called
on
to
pray
aloud
a
terrible
ordeal
to
me
for
i
was
painfully
shy
when
attention
was
called
to
me
i
used
to
suffer
agonies
while
i
waited
for
the
dreaded
words
now
annie
dear
will
you
speak
to
our
lord
but
when
my
trembling
lips
had
forced
themselves
into
speech
all
the
nervousness
used
to
vanish
and
i
was
swept
away
by
an
enthusiasm
that
readily
clothed
itself
in
balanced
sentences
and
alack
at
the
end
i
too
often
hoped
that
god
and
auntie
had
noticed
that
i
prayed
very
nicely
a
vanity
certainly
not
intended
to
be
fostered
by
the
pious
exercise
on
the
whole
the
somewhat
calvinistic
teaching
tended
i
think
to
make
me
a
little
morbid
especially
as
i
always
fretted
silently
after
my
mother
i
remember
she
was
surprised
on
one
of
my
when
miss
marryat
noted
cheerfulness
as
a
want
in
my
character
for
at
home
i
was
ever
the
blithest
of
children
despite
my
love
of
solitude
but
away
there
was
always
an
aching
for
home
and
the
stern
religion
cast
somewhat
of
a
shadow
over
me
though
strangely
enough
hell
never
came
into
my
dreamings
except
in
the
interesting
shape
it
took
in
paradise
lost
after
reading
that
the
devil
was
to
me
no
horned
and
hoofed
horror
but
the
beautiful
shadowed
archangel
and
i
always
hoped
that
jesus
my
ideal
prince
would
save
him
in
the
end
the
things
that
really
frightened
me
were
vague
misty
presences
that
i
felt
were
near
but
could
not
see
they
were
so
real
that
i
knew
just
where
they
were
in
the
room
and
the
peculiar
terror
they
excited
lay
largely
in
the
feeling
that
i
was
just
going
to
see
them
if
by
chance
i
came
across
a
ghost
story
it
haunted
me
for
months
for
i
saw
whatever
unpleasant
spectre
was
described
and
there
was
one
horrid
old
woman
in
a
tale
by
sir
walter
scott
who
glided
up
to
the
foot
of
your
bed
and
sprang
on
it
in
some
eerie
fashion
and
glared
at
you
and
who
made
my
going
to
bed
a
terror
to
me
for
many
weeks
i
can
still
recall
the
feeling
so
vividly
that
it
almost
frightens
me
now
chapter
iii
girlhood
in
the
spring
of
miss
marryat
announced
her
intention
of
going
abroad
and
asked
my
dear
mother
to
let
me
accompany
her
a
little
nephew
whom
she
had
adopted
was
suffering
from
cataract
and
she
desired
to
place
him
under
the
care
of
the
famous
düsseldorf
oculist
amy
marryat
had
been
recalled
home
soon
after
the
death
of
her
mother
who
had
died
in
giving
birth
to
the
child
adopted
by
miss
marryat
and
named
at
her
desire
after
her
favourite
brother
frederick
captain
marryat
her
place
had
been
taken
by
a
girl
a
few
months
older
than
myself
emma
mann
one
of
the
daughters
of
a
clergyman
who
had
married
miss
stanley
closely
related
indeed
if
i
remember
rightly
a
sister
of
the
miss
mary
stanley
who
did
such
noble
work
in
nursing
in
the
crimea
for
some
months
we
had
been
diligently
studying
german
for
miss
marryat
thought
it
wise
that
we
should
know
a
language
fairly
well
before
we
visited
the
country
of
which
it
was
the
native
tongue
we
had
been
trained
also
to
talk
french
daily
during
dinner
so
we
were
not
quite
helpless
foreigners
when
we
steamed
away
from
catherine
docks
and
found
ourselves
on
the
following
day
in
antwerp
amid
what
seemed
to
us
a
very
babel
of
conflicting
tongues
alas
for
our
carefully
spoken
french
articulated
laboriously
we
were
lost
in
that
swirl
of
disputing
and
could
not
understand
a
word
but
miss
marryat
was
quite
equal
to
the
occasion
being
by
no
means
new
to
travelling
and
her
french
stood
the
test
triumphantly
and
steered
us
safely
to
a
hotel
on
the
morrow
we
started
again
through
to
bonn
the
town
which
lies
on
the
borders
of
the
exquisite
scenery
of
which
the
siebengebirge
and
rolandseck
serve
as
the
magic
portal
our
experiences
in
bonn
were
not
wholly
satisfactory
dear
auntie
was
a
maiden
lady
looking
on
all
young
men
as
wolves
to
be
kept
far
from
her
growing
lambs
bonn
was
a
university
town
and
there
was
a
mania
just
then
prevailing
there
for
all
things
english
emma
was
a
plump
rosy
typical
english
maiden
full
of
frolic
and
harmless
fun
i
a
very
slight
pale
girl
alternating
between
wild
fun
and
extreme
pensiveness
in
the
to
which
we
went
at
first
the
château
du
rhin
a
beautiful
place
overhanging
the
broad
blue
rhine
there
chanced
to
be
staying
the
two
sons
of
the
late
duke
of
hamilton
the
marquis
of
douglas
and
lord
charles
with
their
tutor
they
had
the
whole
floor
we
a
on
the
ground
floor
and
bedrooms
above
the
lads
discovered
that
miss
marryat
did
not
like
her
children
to
be
on
speaking
terms
with
any
of
the
male
sect
here
was
a
fine
source
of
amusement
they
would
make
their
horses
caracole
on
the
gravel
in
front
of
our
window
they
would
be
just
starting
for
their
ride
as
we
went
for
walk
or
drive
and
would
salute
us
with
doffed
hat
and
low
bow
they
would
waylay
us
on
our
way
downstairs
with
demure
good
morning
they
would
go
to
church
and
post
themselves
so
that
they
could
survey
our
pew
and
lord
charles
who
possessed
the
power
of
moving
at
will
the
whole
skin
of
the
scalp
would
wriggle
his
hair
up
and
down
till
we
were
choking
with
laughter
to
our
own
imminent
risk
after
a
month
of
this
auntie
was
literally
driven
out
of
the
pretty
château
and
took
refuge
in
a
girls
school
much
to
our
disgust
but
still
she
was
not
allowed
to
be
at
rest
mischievous
students
would
pursue
us
wherever
we
went
sentimental
germans
with
gashed
cheeks
would
whisper
complimentary
phrases
as
we
passed
mere
boyish
nonsense
of
most
harmless
kind
but
the
rather
stern
english
lady
thought
it
not
proper
and
after
three
months
of
bonn
we
were
sent
home
for
the
holidays
somewhat
in
disgrace
but
we
had
some
lovely
excursions
during
those
months
such
clambering
up
mountains
such
rows
on
the
rhine
such
wanderings
in
exquisite
valleys
i
have
a
long
to
retire
into
when
i
want
to
think
of
something
fair
in
recalling
the
moon
as
it
silvered
the
rhine
at
the
foot
of
drachenfels
or
the
soft
island
where
dwelt
the
lady
who
is
consecrated
for
ever
by
roland
love
a
couple
of
months
later
we
rejoined
miss
marryat
in
paris
where
we
spent
seven
happy
workful
months
on
wednesdays
and
saturdays
we
were
free
from
lessons
and
many
a
long
afternoon
was
passed
in
the
galleries
of
the
louvre
till
we
became
familiar
with
the
masterpieces
of
art
gathered
there
from
all
lands
i
doubt
if
there
was
a
beautiful
church
in
paris
that
we
did
not
visit
during
those
weekly
wanderings
that
of
germain
de
was
my
favourite
the
church
whose
bell
gave
the
signal
for
the
massacre
of
bartholomew
for
it
contained
such
marvellous
stained
glass
deepest
purest
glory
of
colour
that
i
had
ever
seen
the
solemn
beauty
of
notre
dame
the
somewhat
gaudy
magnificence
of
la
sainte
chapelle
the
stateliness
of
la
madeleine
the
impressive
gloom
of
roch
were
all
familiar
to
us
other
delights
were
found
in
mingling
with
the
bright
crowds
which
passed
along
the
champs
elysees
and
sauntered
in
the
bois
de
boulogne
in
strolling
in
the
garden
of
the
tuileries
in
climbing
to
the
top
of
every
monument
whence
view
of
paris
could
be
gained
the
empire
was
then
in
its
heyday
of
glitter
and
we
much
enjoyed
seeing
the
brilliant
escort
of
the
imperial
carriage
with
plumes
and
gold
and
silver
dancing
and
glistening
in
the
sunlight
while
in
the
carriage
sat
the
exquisitely
lovely
empress
with
the
little
boy
beside
her
touching
his
cap
shyly
but
with
something
of
her
own
grace
in
answer
to
a
greeting
the
boy
who
was
thought
to
be
born
to
an
imperial
crown
but
whose
brief
career
was
to
find
an
ending
from
the
spears
of
savages
in
a
quarrel
in
which
he
had
no
concern
in
the
spring
of
it
chanced
that
the
bishop
of
ohio
visited
paris
and
forbes
then
english
chaplain
at
the
church
of
the
rue
arranged
to
have
a
confirmation
as
said
above
i
was
under
deep
religious
impressions
and
in
fact
with
the
exception
of
that
little
aberration
in
germany
i
was
decidedly
a
pious
girl
i
looked
on
theatres
never
having
been
to
one
as
traps
set
by
satan
for
the
destruction
of
foolish
souls
i
was
quite
determined
never
to
go
to
a
ball
and
was
prepared
to
suffer
for
conscience
sake
little
prig
that
i
was
if
i
was
desired
to
go
to
one
i
was
consequently
quite
prepared
to
take
upon
myself
the
vows
made
in
my
name
at
my
baptism
and
to
renounce
the
world
the
flesh
and
the
devil
with
a
heartiness
and
sincerity
only
equalled
by
my
profound
ignorance
of
the
things
i
so
readily
resigned
that
confirmation
was
to
me
a
very
solemn
matter
the
careful
preparation
the
prolonged
prayers
the
wondering
awe
as
to
the
gifts
of
the
spirit
which
were
to
be
given
by
the
laying
on
of
hands
all
tended
to
excitement
i
could
scarcely
control
myself
as
i
knelt
at
the
altar
rails
and
felt
as
though
the
gentle
touch
of
the
aged
bishop
which
fluttered
for
an
instant
on
my
bowed
head
were
the
very
touch
of
the
wing
of
that
holy
spirit
heavenly
dove
whose
presence
had
been
so
earnestly
invoked
is
there
anything
easier
i
wonder
than
to
make
a
young
and
sensitive
girl
intensely
religious
this
stay
in
paris
roused
into
activity
an
aspect
of
my
religious
nature
that
had
hitherto
been
latent
i
discovered
the
sensuous
enjoyment
that
lay
in
introducing
colour
and
fragrance
and
pomp
into
religious
services
so
that
the
gratification
of
the
aesthetic
emotions
became
dignified
with
the
garb
of
piety
the
of
the
louvre
crowded
with
madonnas
and
saints
the
roman
catholic
churches
with
their
air
and
exquisite
music
brought
a
new
joy
into
my
life
a
more
vivid
colour
to
my
dreams
insensibly
the
colder
cruder
evangelicalism
that
i
had
never
thoroughly
assimilated
grew
warmer
and
more
brilliant
and
the
ideal
divine
prince
of
my
childhood
took
on
the
more
pathetic
lineaments
of
the
man
of
sorrows
the
deeper
attractiveness
of
the
suffering
saviour
of
men
keble
christian
year
took
the
place
of
paradise
lost
and
as
my
girlhood
began
to
bud
towards
womanhood
all
its
deeper
currents
set
in
the
direction
of
religious
devotion
my
mother
did
not
allow
me
to
read
love
stories
and
my
daydreams
of
the
future
were
scarcely
touched
by
any
of
the
ordinary
hopes
and
fears
of
a
girl
lifting
her
eyes
towards
the
world
she
is
shortly
to
enter
they
were
filled
with
broodings
over
the
days
when
were
blessed
with
visions
of
the
king
of
martyrs
when
sweet
agnes
saw
her
celestial
bridegroom
and
angels
stooped
to
whisper
melodies
in
cecilia
raptured
ear
why
then
and
not
now
my
heart
would
question
and
i
would
lose
myself
in
these
fancies
never
happier
than
when
alone
the
summer
of
was
spent
with
miss
marryat
at
sidmouth
and
wise
woman
that
she
was
she
now
carefully
directed
our
studies
with
a
view
to
our
coming
enfranchisement
from
the
schoolroom
more
and
more
were
we
trained
to
work
alone
our
were
slackened
so
that
we
never
felt
them
save
when
we
blundered
and
i
remember
that
when
i
once
complained
in
loving
fashion
that
she
was
teaching
me
so
little
she
told
me
that
i
was
getting
old
enough
to
be
trusted
to
work
by
myself
and
that
i
must
not
expect
to
have
auntie
for
a
crutch
all
through
life
and
i
venture
to
say
that
this
gentle
withdrawal
of
constant
supervision
and
teaching
was
one
of
the
wisest
and
kindest
things
that
this
woman
ever
did
for
us
it
is
the
usual
custom
to
keep
girls
in
the
schoolroom
until
they
come
out
then
suddenly
they
are
left
to
their
own
devices
and
bewildered
by
their
unaccustomed
freedom
they
waste
time
that
might
be
priceless
for
their
intellectual
growth
lately
the
opening
of
universities
to
women
has
removed
this
danger
for
the
more
ambitious
but
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
writing
no
one
dreamed
of
the
changes
soon
to
be
made
in
the
direction
of
the
higher
education
of
women
during
the
winter
of
miss
marryat
was
in
london
and
for
a
few
months
i
remained
there
with
her
attending
the
admirable
french
classes
of
roche
in
the
spring
i
returned
home
to
harrow
going
up
each
week
to
the
classes
and
when
these
were
over
auntie
told
me
that
she
thought
all
she
could
usefully
do
was
done
and
that
it
was
time
that
i
should
try
my
wings
alone
so
well
however
had
she
succeeded
in
her
aims
that
my
emancipation
from
the
schoolroom
was
but
the
of
more
eager
study
though
now
the
study
turned
into
the
lines
of
thought
towards
which
my
personal
tendencies
most
attracted
me
german
i
continued
to
read
with
a
master
and
music
under
the
marvellously
able
teaching
of
john
farmer
musical
director
of
harrow
school
took
up
much
of
my
time
my
dear
mother
had
a
passion
for
music
and
beethoven
and
bach
were
her
favourite
composers
there
was
scarcely
a
sonata
of
beethoven
that
i
did
not
learn
scarcely
a
fugue
of
bach
that
i
did
not
master
mendelssohn
lieder
gave
a
lighter
recreation
and
many
a
happy
evening
did
we
spend
my
mother
and
i
over
the
stately
strains
of
the
blind
titan
and
the
sweet
melodies
of
the
german
wordless
orator
musical
at
homes
too
were
favourite
amusements
at
harrow
and
at
these
my
facile
fingers
made
me
a
welcome
guest
thus
set
free
from
the
schoolroom
at
an
only
daughter
i
could
do
with
my
time
as
i
would
save
for
the
couple
of
hours
a
day
given
to
music
for
the
satisfaction
of
my
mother
from
then
till
i
became
engaged
just
before
i
was
my
life
flowed
on
smoothly
one
current
visible
to
all
and
dancing
in
the
sunlight
the
other
running
underground
but
full
and
deep
and
strong
as
regards
my
outer
life
no
girl
had
a
brighter
happier
life
than
mine
studying
all
the
mornings
and
most
of
the
afternoons
in
my
own
way
and
spending
the
latter
part
of
the
day
in
games
and
walks
and
rides
varied
with
parties
at
which
i
was
one
of
the
merriest
of
guests
i
practised
archery
so
zealously
that
i
carried
up
triumphantly
as
prize
for
the
best
score
the
first
ring
i
ever
possessed
while
croquet
found
me
a
most
eager
devotee
my
darling
mother
certainly
spoiled
me
so
far
as
were
concerned
all
the
small
roughnesses
of
life
she
never
allowed
a
trouble
of
any
kind
to
touch
me
and
cared
only
that
all
worries
should
fall
on
her
all
joys
on
me
i
know
now
what
i
never
dreamed
then
that
her
life
was
one
of
serious
anxiety
the
heavy
burden
of
my
brother
school
and
college
life
pressed
on
her
constantly
and
her
need
of
money
was
often
serious
a
lawyer
whom
she
trusted
absolutely
cheated
her
systematically
using
for
his
own
purposes
the
remittances
she
made
for
payment
of
liabilities
thus
keeping
upon
her
a
constant
drain
yet
for
me
all
that
was
wanted
was
ever
there
was
it
a
ball
to
which
we
were
going
i
need
never
think
of
what
i
would
wear
till
the
time
for
dressing
arrived
and
there
laid
out
ready
for
me
was
all
i
wanted
every
detail
complete
from
top
to
toe
no
hand
but
hers
must
dress
my
hair
which
loosed
fell
in
dense
curly
masses
nearly
to
my
knees
no
hand
but
hers
must
fasten
dress
and
deck
with
flowers
and
if
i
sometimes
would
coaxingly
ask
if
i
might
not
help
by
sewing
in
laces
or
by
doing
some
trifle
in
aid
she
would
kiss
me
and
bid
me
run
to
my
books
or
my
play
telling
me
that
her
only
pleasure
in
life
was
caring
for
her
treasure
alas
how
lightly
we
take
the
labour
that
makes
life
so
easy
ere
yet
we
have
known
what
life
means
when
the
protecting
motherwing
is
withdrawn
so
guarded
and
shielded
had
been
my
childhood
and
youth
from
every
touch
of
pain
and
anxiety
that
love
could
bear
for
me
that
i
never
dreamed
that
life
might
be
a
heavy
burden
save
as
i
saw
it
in
the
poor
i
was
sent
to
help
all
the
joy
of
those
happy
years
i
took
not
ungratefully
i
hope
but
certainly
with
as
glad
unconsciousness
of
anything
rare
in
it
as
i
took
the
sunlight
passionate
love
indeed
i
gave
to
my
darling
but
i
never
knew
all
i
owed
her
till
i
passed
out
of
her
tender
guardianship
till
i
left
my
mother
home
is
such
training
wise
i
am
not
sure
it
makes
the
ordinary
roughnesses
of
life
come
with
so
stunning
a
shock
when
one
goes
out
into
the
world
that
one
is
apt
to
question
whether
some
earlier
initiation
into
life
sterner
mysteries
would
not
be
wiser
for
the
young
yet
it
is
a
fair
thing
to
have
that
joyous
youth
to
look
back
upon
and
at
least
it
is
a
treasury
of
memory
that
no
thief
can
steal
in
the
struggles
of
later
life
sunshine
they
called
me
in
those
bright
days
of
merry
play
and
earnest
study
but
that
study
showed
the
bent
of
my
thought
and
linked
itself
to
the
hidden
life
for
the
fathers
of
the
early
christian
church
now
became
my
chief
companions
and
i
pored
over
the
shepherd
of
hernias
the
epistles
of
polycarp
barnabas
ignatius
and
clement
the
commentaries
of
chrysostom
the
confessions
of
augustine
with
these
i
studied
the
writings
of
pusey
liddon
and
keble
with
many
another
smaller
light
joying
in
the
great
conception
of
a
catholic
church
lasting
through
the
centuries
built
on
the
foundations
of
apostles
and
of
martyrs
stretching
from
the
days
of
christ
himself
down
to
our
own
one
lord
one
faith
one
baptism
and
i
myself
a
child
of
that
holy
church
the
hidden
life
grew
stronger
constantly
fed
by
these
streams
of
study
weekly
communion
became
the
centre
round
which
my
devotional
life
revolved
with
its
ecstatic
meditation
its
growing
intensity
of
conscious
contact
with
the
divine
i
fasted
according
to
the
ordinances
of
the
church
occasionally
flagellated
myself
to
see
if
i
could
bear
physical
pain
should
i
be
fortunate
enough
ever
to
tread
the
pathway
trodden
by
the
saints
and
ever
the
christ
was
the
figure
round
which
clustered
all
my
hopes
and
longings
till
i
often
felt
that
the
very
passion
of
my
devotion
would
draw
him
down
from
his
throne
in
heaven
present
visibly
in
form
as
i
felt
him
invisibly
in
spirit
to
serve
him
through
his
church
became
more
and
more
a
definite
ideal
in
my
life
and
my
thoughts
began
to
turn
towards
some
kind
of
religious
life
in
which
i
might
prove
my
love
by
sacrifice
and
turn
my
passionate
gratitude
into
active
service
looking
back
over
my
life
i
see
that
its
keynote
through
all
the
blunders
and
the
blind
mistakes
and
clumsy
follies
has
been
this
longing
for
sacrifice
to
something
felt
as
greater
than
the
self
it
has
been
so
strong
and
so
persistent
that
i
recognise
it
now
as
a
tendency
brought
over
from
a
previous
life
and
dominating
the
present
one
and
this
is
shown
by
the
fact
that
to
follow
it
is
not
the
act
of
a
deliberate
and
conscious
will
forcing
self
into
submission
and
giving
up
with
pain
something
the
heart
desires
but
the
following
it
is
a
joyous
springing
forward
along
the
easiest
path
the
sacrifice
being
the
supremely
attractive
thing
not
to
make
which
would
be
to
deny
the
deepest
longings
of
the
soul
and
to
feel
oneself
polluted
and
dishonoured
and
it
is
here
that
the
misjudgment
comes
in
of
many
generous
hearts
who
have
spoken
sometimes
lately
so
strongly
in
my
praise
for
the
efforts
to
serve
have
not
been
painful
acts
of
but
the
yielding
to
an
overmastering
desire
we
do
not
praise
the
mother
who
impelled
by
her
protecting
love
feeds
her
crying
infant
and
stills
its
wailings
at
her
breast
rather
should
we
blame
her
if
she
turned
aside
from
its
weeping
to
play
with
some
toy
and
so
with
all
those
whose
ears
are
opened
to
the
wailings
of
the
great
orphan
humanity
they
are
less
to
be
praised
for
helping
than
they
would
be
to
be
blamed
if
they
stood
aside
i
now
know
that
it
is
those
wailings
that
have
stirred
my
heart
through
life
and
that
i
brought
with
me
the
ears
open
to
hear
them
from
previous
lives
of
service
paid
to
men
it
was
those
lives
that
drew
for
the
child
the
alluring
pictures
of
martyrdom
breathed
into
the
girl
the
passion
of
devotion
sent
the
woman
out
to
face
scoff
and
odium
and
drove
her
finally
into
the
theosophy
that
rationalises
sacrifice
while
opening
up
possibilities
of
service
beside
which
all
other
hopes
grow
pale
the
easter
of
was
a
memorable
date
in
my
life
i
was
introduced
to
the
clergyman
i
married
and
i
met
and
conquered
my
first
religious
doubt
a
little
mission
church
had
been
opened
the
preceding
christmas
in
a
very
poor
district
of
clapham
my
grandfather
house
was
near
at
hand
in
albert
square
and
a
favourite
aunt
and
myself
devoted
ourselves
a
good
deal
to
this
little
church
as
enthusiastic
girls
and
women
will
at
easter
we
decorated
it
with
spring
flowers
with
dewy
primroses
and
fragrant
violets
and
with
the
yellow
bells
of
the
wild
daffodil
to
the
huge
delight
of
the
poor
who
crowded
in
and
of
the
little
london
children
who
had
many
of
them
never
seen
a
flower
here
i
met
the
rev
frank
besant
a
young
cambridge
man
who
had
just
taken
orders
and
was
serving
the
little
mission
church
as
deacon
strange
that
at
the
same
time
i
should
meet
the
man
i
was
to
marry
and
the
doubts
which
were
to
break
the
marriage
tie
for
in
the
holy
week
preceding
that
easter
eve
i
had
been
as
english
and
roman
catholics
are
wont
to
do
trying
to
throw
the
mind
back
to
the
time
when
the
commemorated
events
occurred
and
to
follow
step
by
step
the
last
days
of
the
son
of
man
living
as
it
were
through
those
last
hours
so
that
i
might
be
ready
to
kneel
before
the
cross
on
good
friday
to
stand
beside
the
sepulchre
on
easter
day
in
order
to
facilitate
the
realisation
of
those
last
sacred
days
of
god
incarnate
on
earth
working
out
man
salvation
i
resolved
to
write
a
brief
history
of
that
week
compiled
from
the
four
gospels
meaning
them
to
try
and
realise
each
day
the
occurrences
that
had
happened
on
the
corresponding
date
in
and
so
to
follow
those
blessed
feet
step
by
step
till
they
were
nailed
for
our
advantage
to
the
bitter
cross
with
the
fearlessness
which
springs
from
ignorance
i
sat

at
i
became
uneasy
as
i
proceeded
with
my
task
for
discrepancies
leaped
at
me
from
my
four
columns
the
uneasiness
grew
as
the
contradictions
increased
until
i
saw
with
a
shock
of
horror
that
my
harmony
was
a
discord
and
a
doubt
of
the
veracity
of
the
story
sprang
up
like
a
serpent
hissing
in
my
face
it
was
struck
down
in
a
moment
for
to
me
to
doubt
was
sin
and
to
have
doubted
on
the
very
eve
of
the
passion
was
an
added
crime
quickly
i
assured
myself
that
these
apparent
contradictions
were
necessary
as
tests
of
faith
and
i
forced
myself
to
repeat
tertullian
famous
credo
quia
impossible
till
from
a
wooden
recital
it
became
a
triumphant
affirmation
i
reminded
myself
that
peter
had
said
of
the
pauline
epistles
that
in
them
were
some
things
hard
to
be
understood
which
they
that
are
unlearned
and
unstable
wrest
unto
their
own
destruction
i
shudderingly
recognised
that
i
must
be
very
unlearned
and
unstable
to
find
discord
among
the
holy
evangelists
and
imposed
on
myself
an
extra
fast
as
penance
for
my
ignorance
and
lack
of
firmness
in
the
faith
for
my
mental
position
was
one
to
which
doubt
was
one
of
the
worst
of
sins
i
knew
that
there
were
people
like
colenso
who
questioned
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
but
i
remembered
how
the
apostle
john
had
fled
from
the
baths
when
cerinthus
entered
them
lest
the
roof
should
fall
on
the
heretic
and
crush
any
one
in
his
neighbourhood
and
i
looked
on
all
heretics
with
holy
horror
pusey
had
indoctrinated
me
with
his
stern
hatred
of
all
heresy
and
i
was
content
to
rest
with
him
on
that
faith
which
must
be
old
because
it
is
eternal
and
must
be
unchangeable
because
it
is
true
i
would
not
even
read
the
works
of
my
mothers
favourite
stanley
because
he
was
unsound
and
because
pusey
had
condemned
his
variegated
use
of
words
which
destroys
all
definiteness
of
meaning
a
clever
and
pointed
description
be
it
said
in
passing
of
the
dean
exquisite
phrases
capable
of
so
many
readings
it
can
then
be
imagined
with
what
a
stab
of
pain
this
first
doubt
struck
me
and
with
what
haste
i
smothered
it
up
buried
it
and
smoothed
the
turf
over
its
grave
it
had
been
and
it
left
its
mark
chapter
iv
marriage
the
last
year
of
my
girlish
freedom
was
drawing
to
its
close
how
shall
i
hope
to
make
commonsense
readers
understand
how
i
became
betrothed
maiden
ere
yet
nineteen
when
twenty
years
had
struck
looking
back
over
years
i
feel
a
profound
pity
for
the
girl
standing
at
that
critical
point
of
life
so
utterly
hopelessly
ignorant
of
all
that
marriage
meant
so
filled
with
impossible
dreams
so
unfitted
for
the
of
wife
as
i
have
said
my
held
little
place
for
love
partly
from
the
absence
of
love
novels
from
my
reading
partly
from
the
mystic
fancies
that
twined
themselves
round
the
figure
of
the
christ
catholic
books
of
devotion
english
or
roman
it
matters
not
for
to
a
large
extent
they
are
translations
of
the
same
hymns
and
prayers
are
exceedingly
glowing
in
their
language
and
the
dawning
feelings
of
womanhood
unconsciously
lend
to
them
a
passionate
fervour
i
longed
to
spend
my
time
in
worshipping
jesus
and
was
as
far
as
my
inner
life
was
concerned
absorbed
in
that
passionate
love
of
the
saviour
which
among
emotional
catholics
really
is
the
human
passion
of
love
transferred
to
an
ideal
for
women
to
jesus
for
men
to
the
virgin
mary
in
order
to
show
that
i
am
not
here
exaggerating
i
subjoin
a
few
of
the
prayers
in
which
i
found
daily
delight
and
i
do
this
in
order
to
show
how
an
emotional
girl
may
be
attracted
by
these
devotional
exercises
o
crucified
love
raise
in
me
fresh
ardours
of
love
and
consolation
that
it
may
henceforth
be
the
greatest
torment
i
can
endure
ever
to
offend
thee
that
it
may
be
my
greatest
delight
to
please
thee
let
the
remembrance
of
thy
death
o
lord
jesu
make
me
to
desire
and
pant
after
thee
that
i
may
delight
in
thy
gracious
presence
o
most
sweet
jesu
christ
i
unworthy
sinner
yet
redeemed
by
thy
precious
blood
thine
i
am
and
will
be
in
life
and
in
death
o
jesu
beloved
fairer
than
the
sons
of
men
draw
me
after
thee
with
the
cords
of
thy
love
blessed
are
thou
o
most
merciful
god
who
didst
vouchsafe
to
espouse
me
to
the
heavenly
bridegroom
in
the
waters
of
baptism
and
hast
imparted
thy
body
and
blood
as
a
new
gift
of
espousal
and
the
meet
consummation
of
thy
love
o
most
sweet
lord
jesu
transfix
the
affections
of
my
inmost
soul
with
that
most
joyous
and
most
healthful
wound
of
thy
love
with
true
serene
most
holy
apostolical
charity
that
my
soul
may
ever
languish
and
melt
with
entire
love
and
longing
for
thee
let
it
desire
thee
and
faint
for
thy
courts
long
to
be
dissolved
and
be
with
thee
oh
that
i
could
embrace
thee
with
that
most
burning
love
of
angels
let
him
kiss
me
with
the
kisses
of
his
mouth
for
thy
love
is
better
than
wine
draw
me
we
will
run
after
thee
the
king
hath
brought
me
into
his
chambers
let
my
soul
o
lord
feel
the
sweetness
of
thy
presence
may
it
taste
how
sweet
thou
art
may
the
sweet
and
burning
power
of
thy
love
i
beseech
thee
absorb
my
soul
all
girls
have
in
them
the
germ
of
passion
and
the
line
of
its
development
depends
on
the
character
brought
into
the
world
and
the
surrounding
influences
of
education
i
had
but
two
ideals
in
my
childhood
and
youth
round
whom
twined
these
budding
tendrils
of
passion
they
were
my
mother
and
the
christ
i
know
this
may
seem
strange
but
i
am
trying
to
state
things
as
they
were
in
this
and
not
give
mere
conventionalisms
and
so
it
was
i
had
men
friends
but
no
lovers
at
least
to
my
knowledge
for
i
have
since
heard
that
my
mother
received
two
or
three
offers
of
marriage
for
me
but
declined
them
on
account
of
my
youth
and
my
childishness
friends
with
whom
i
liked
to
talk
because
they
knew
more
than
i
did
but
they
had
no
place
in
my
these
were
more
and
more
filled
with
the
one
ideal
man
and
my
hopes
turned
towards
the
life
of
the
sister
of
mercy
who
ever
worships
the
christ
and
devotes
her
life
to
the
service
of
his
poor
i
knew
my
dear
mother
would
set
herself
against
this
idea
but
it
nestled
warm
at
my
heart
for
ever
that
idea
of
escaping
from
the
humdrum
of
ordinary
life
by
some
complete
sacrifice
lured
me
onwards
with
its
overmastering
fascination
now
one
unlucky
result
of
this
view
of
religion
is
the
idealisation
of
the
clergyman
the
special
messenger
and
chosen
servant
of
the
lord
far
more
lofty
than
any
title
bestowed
by
earthly
monarch
is
that
patent
of
nobility
straight
from
the
hand
of
the
king
of
kings
that
seems
to
give
to
the
mortal
something
of
the
authority
of
the
immortal
and
to
crown
the
head
of
the
priest
with
the
diadem
that
belongs
to
those
who
are
kings
and
priests
unto
god
viewed
in
this
way
the
position
of
the
priest
wife
seems
second
only
to
that
of
the
nun
and
has
therefore
a
wonderful
attractiveness
an
attractiveness
in
which
the
particular
clergyman
affected
plays
a
very
subordinate
part
it
is
the
sacred
office
the
nearness
to
holy
things
the
consecration
which
seems
to
include
the
wife
it
is
these
things
that
shed
a
glamour
over
the
clerical
life
which
attracts
most
those
who
are
most
apt
to
most
swayed
by
imagination
and
the
saddest
pity
of
all
this
is
that
the
glamour
is
most
over
those
whose
brains
are
quick
whose
hearts
are
pure
who
are
responsive
to
all
forms
of
noble
emotions
all
suggestions
of
personal
if
such
in
later
life
rise
to
the
higher
emotions
whose
shadows
have
attracted
them
and
to
that
higher
whose
whispers
reached
them
in
their
early
youth
then
the
false
prophet
veil
is
raised
the
poverty
of
the
conception
seen
and
the
life
is
either
wrecked
or
through
and
surge
of
battling
billows
with
loss
of
mast
and
sail
is
steered
by
firm
hand
into
the
port
of
a
nobler
faith
that
summer
of
saw
me
engaged
to
the
young
clergyman
i
had
met
at
the
mission
church
in
the
spring
our
knowledge
of
each
other
being
an
almost
negligeable
quantity
we
were
thrown
together
for
a
week
the
only
two
young
ones
in
a
small
party
of
and
in
our
walks
rides
and
drives
we
were
naturally
companions
an
hour
or
two
before
he
left
he
asked
me
to
marry
him
taking
my
consent
for
granted
as
i
had
allowed
him
such
full
companionship
a
perfectly
fair
assumption
with
girls
accustomed
to
look
on
all
men
as
possible
husbands
but
wholly
mistaken
as
regarded
myself
whose
thoughts
were
in
quite
other
directions
startled
and
my
sensitive
pride
touched
by
what
seemed
to
my
strict
views
an
assumption
that
i
had
been
flirting
i
hesitated
did
not
follow
my
first
impulse
of
refusal
but
took
refuge
in
silence
my
suitor
had
to
catch
his
train
and
bound
me
over
to
silence
till
he
could
himself
speak
to
my
mother
urging
authoritatively
that
it
would
be
dishonourable
of
me
to
break
his
confidence
and
left
me
the
most
upset
and
distressed
little
person
on
the
sussex
coast
the
fortnight
that
followed
was
the
first
unhappy
one
of
my
life
for
i
had
a
secret
from
my
mother
a
secret
which
i
passionately
longed
to
tell
her
but
dared
not
speak
at
the
risk
of
doing
a
dishonourable
thing
on
meeting
my
suitor
on
our
return
to
town
i
positively
refused
to
keep
silence
any
longer
and
then
out
of
sheer
weakness
and
fear
of
inflicting
pain
i
drifted
into
an
engagement
with
a
man
i
did
not
pretend
to
love
drifted
is
the
right
word
for
two
or
three
months
passed
on
the
ground
that
i
was
so
much
of
a
child
before
my
mother
would
consent
to
a
definite
engagement
my
dislike
of
the
thought
of
marriage
faded
before
the
idea
of
becoming
the
wife
of
a
priest
working
ever
in
the
church
and
among
the
poor
i
had
no
outlet
for
my
growing
desire
for
usefulness
in
my
happy
and
peaceful
where
all
religious
enthusiasm
was
regarded
as
unbalanced
and
unbecoming
all
that
was
deepest
and
truest
in
my
nature
chafed
against
my
easy
useless
days
longed
for
work
yearned
to
devote
itself
as
i
had
read
women
saints
had
done
to
the
service
of
the
church
and
of
the
poor
to
the
battling
against
sin
and
misery
what
empty
names
sin
and
misery
then
were
to
me
you
will
have
more
opportunities
for
doing
good
as
a
clergyman
wife
than
as
anything
else
was
one
of
the
pleas
urged
on
my
reluctance
in
the
autumn
i
was
definitely
betrothed
and
i
married
fourteen
months
later
once
in
the
interval
i
tried
to
break
the
engagement
but
on
my
broaching
the
subject
to
my
mother
all
her
pride
rose
up
in
revolt
would
i
her
daughter
break
my
word
would
i
dishonour
myself
by
jilting
a
man
i
had
pledged
myself
to
marry
she
could
be
stern
where
honour
was
involved
that
sweet
mother
of
mine
and
i
yielded
to
her
wish
as
i
had
been
ever
wont
to
do
for
a
look
or
a
word
from
her
had
ever
been
my
law
save
where
religion
was
concerned
so
i
married
in
the
winter
of
with
no
more
idea
of
the
marriage
relation
than
if
i
had
been
four
years
old
instead
of
twenty
my
dreamy
life
into
which
no
knowledge
of
evil
had
been
allowed
to
penetrate
in
which
i
had
been
guarded
from
all
pain
shielded
from
all
anxiety
kept
innocent
on
all
questions
of
sex
was
no
preparation
for
married
existence
and
left
me
defenceless
to
face
a
rude
awakening
looking
back
on
it
all
i
deliberately
say
that
no
more
fatal
blunder
can
be
made
than
to
train
a
girl
to
womanhood
in
ignorance
of
all
life
duties
and
burdens
and
then
to
let
her
face
them
for
the
first
time
away
from
all
the
old
associations
the
old
helps
the
old
refuge
on
the
mother
breast
that
perfect
innocence
may
be
very
beautiful
but
it
is
a
perilous
possession
and
eve
should
have
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
ere
she
wanders
forth
from
the
paradise
of
a
mother
love
many
an
unhappy
marriage
dates
from
its
very
beginning
from
the
terrible
shock
to
a
young
girl
sensitive
modesty
and
pride
her
helpless
bewilderment
and
fear
men
with
their
public
school
and
college
education
or
the
knowledge
that
comes
by
living
in
the
outside
world
may
find
it
hard
to
realise
the
possibility
of
such
infantile
ignorance
in
many
girls
none
the
less
such
ignorance
is
a
fact
in
the
case
of
some
girls
at
least
and
no
mother
should
let
her
daughter
blindfold
slip
her
neck
under
the
marriage
yoke
before
leaving
the
harbourage
of
girlhood
to
set
sail
on
the
troublous
sea
of
life
there
is
an
occurrence
of
which
i
must
make
mention
as
it
marks
my
first
awakening
of
interest
in
the
outer
world
of
political
struggle
in
the
autumn
of
my
mother
and
i
were
staying
with
some
dear
friends
of
ours
the
robertses
at
pendleton
near
manchester
roberts
was
the
poor
man
lawyer
in
the
affectionate
phrase
used
of
him
by
many
a
hundred
men
he
was
a
close
friend
of
ernest
jones
and
was
always
ready
to
fight
a
poor
battle
without
fee
he
worked
hard
in
the
agitation
which
saved
women
from
working
in
the
mines
and
i
have
heard
him
tell
how
he
had
seen
them
toiling
naked
to
the
waist
with
short
petticoats
barely
reaching
to
their
knees
rough
brutalised
out
of
all
womanly
decency
and
grace
and
how
he
had
seen
little
children
working
there
too
babies
of
three
and
four
set
to
watch
a
door
and
falling
asleep
at
their
work
to
be
roused
by
curse
and
kick
to
the
unfair
toil
the
old
man
eye
would
begin
to
flash
and
his
voice
to
rise
as
he
told
of
these
horrors
and
then
his
face
would
soften
as
he
added
that
after
it
was
all
over
and
the
slavery
was
put
an
end
to
as
he
went
through
a
coal
district
the
women
standing
at
their
doors
would
lift
up
their
children
to
see
lawyer
roberts
go
by
and
would
bid
god
bless
him
for
what
he
had
done
this
dear
old
man
was
my
first
tutor
in
radicalism
and
i
was
an
apt
pupil
i
had
taken
no
interest
in
politics
but
had
unconsciously
reflected
more
or
less
the
decorous
whiggism
which
had
always
surrounded
me
i
regarded
the
poor
as
folk
to
be
educated
looked
after
charitably
dealt
with
and
always
treated
with
most
perfect
courtesy
the
courtesy
being
due
from
me
as
a
lady
to
all
equally
whether
they
were
rich
or
poor
but
to
roberts
the
poor
were
the
the
wealth
producers
with
a
right
to
not
to
looking
after
with
a
right
to
justice
not
to
charity
and
he
preached
his
doctrines
to
me
in
season
and
out
of
season
i
was
a
pet
of
his
and
used
often
to
drive
him
to
his
office
in
the
morning
glorying
much
in
the
fact
that
my
skill
was
trusted
in
guiding
a
horse
through
the
crowded
manchester
streets
during
these
drives
and
on
all
other
available
occasions
roberts
would
preach
to
me
the
cause
of
the
people
what
do
you
think
of
john
bright
he
demanded
suddenly
one
day
looking
at
me
with
fiery
eyes
from
under
heavy
brows
i
have
never
thought
of
him
at
all
was
the
careless
answer
is
he
a
rather
rough
sort
of
man
who
goes
about
making
rows
there
i
thought
so
he
thundered
at
me
fiercely
just
what
i
say
i
believe
some
of
you
fine
ladies
would
not
go
to
heaven
if
you
had
to
rub
shoulders
with
john
bright
the
noblest
man
god
ever
gave
to
the
cause
of
the
poor
this
was
the
and
lovable
demagogue
as
he
was
called
with
whom
we
were
staying
when
colonel
kelly
and
captain
deasy
two
fenian
leaders
were
arrested
in
manchester
and
put
on
their
trial
the
whole
irish
population
became
seething
with
excitement
and
on
september
the
police
van
carrying
them
to
salford
gaol
was
stopped
at
the
bellevue
railway
arch
by
the
sudden
fall
of
one
of
the
horses
shot
from
the
side
of
the
road
in
a
moment
the
van
was
surrounded
and
crowbars
were
wrenching
at
the
van
door
it
resisted
a
body
of
police
was
rapidly
approaching
and
if
the
rescue
was
to
be
effective
the
door
must
be
opened
the
rescuers
shouted
to
brett
the
constable
inside
to
pass
out
his
keys
he
refused
and
some
one
exclaimed
blow
off
the
lock
in
a
moment
the
muzzle
of
a
revolver
was
against
the
lock
and
it
was
blown
off
but
brett
stooping
down
to
look
through
the
keyhole
received
the
bullet
in
his
head
and
fell
dying
as
the
door
flew
open
another
moment
and
allen
a
lad
of
seventeen
had
wrenched
open
the
doors
of
the
compartments
occupied
by
kelly
and
deasy
dragged
them
out
and
while
two
or
three
hurried
them
off
to
a
place
of
safety
the
others
threw
themselves
between
the
fugitives
and
the
police
and
with
levelled
revolvers
guarded
their
flight
the
fenian
leaders
once
safe
they
scattered
and
young
william
allen
whose
one
thought
had
been
for
his
chiefs
seeing
them
safe
fired
his
revolver
in
the
air
for
he
would
not
shed
blood
in
his
own
defence
disarmed
by
his
own
act
he
was
set
on
by
the
police
brutally
struck
down
kicked
and
stoned
and
was
dragged
off
to
gaol
faint
and
bleeding
to
meet
there
some
of
his
comrades
in
much
the
same
plight
as
himself
then
manchester
went
mad
and
flared
up
into
flame
no
irish
workman
was
safe
in
a
crowd
of
englishmen
no
englishman
safe
in
the
irish
quarter
the
friends
of
the
prisoners
besieged
lawyer
roberts
house
praying
his
aid
and
he
threw
his
whole
fiery
soul
into
their
defence
the
man
who
had
fired
the
accidentally
fatal
shot
was
safely
out
of
the
way
and
none
of
the
others
had
hurt
a
human
being
a
special
commission
was
issued
with
justice
blackburn
at
its
head
the
hanging
judge
groaned
roberts
and
it
was
soon
in
manchester
for
all
roberts
efforts
to
get
the
venue
of
the
trial
changed
were
futile
though
of
fair
trial
then
in
manchester
there
was
no
chance
on
october
the
prisoners
were
actually
brought
up
before
the
magistrates
in
irons
and
ernest
jones
their
counsel
failing
in
his
protest
against
this
outrage
threw
down
his
brief
and
left
the
court
so
great
was
the
haste
with
which
the
trial
was
hurried
on
that
on
the
allen
larkin
gould
maguire
and
condon
were
standing
in
the
dock
before
the
commission
charged
with
murder
my
first
experience
of
an
angry
crowd
was
on
that
day
as
we
drove
to
the
court
the
streets
were
barricaded
the
soldiers
were
under
arms
every
approach
to
the
court
crowded
with
surging
throngs
at
last
our
carriage
was
stopped
as
we
were
passing
at
a
foot
pace
through
an
irish
section
of
the
crowd
and
various
vehement
fists
came
through
the
window
with
hearty
curses
at
the
d
d
english
who
were
going
to
see
the
boys
murdered
the
situation
was
critical
for
we
were
two
women
and
three
girls
when
i
bethought
myself
that
we
were
unknown
and
gently
touched
the
nearest
fist
friends
these
are
roberts
wife
and
daughters
roberts
lawyer
roberts
god
bless
roberts
let
his
carriage
through
and
all
the
scowling
faces
became
and
curses
changed
to
cheers
as
a
road
to
the
court
steps
was
cleared
for
us
alas
if
there
was
passion
on
behalf
of
the
prisoners
outside
there
was
passion
against
them
within
and
the
very
opening
of
the
trial
showed
the
spirit
that
animated
the
prosecution
and
the
bench
digby
seymour
and
ernest
jones
were
briefed
for
the
defence
and
roberts
did
not
think
that
they
exercised
sufficiently
their
right
of
challenge
he
knew
as
we
all
did
that
many
on
the
panel
had
loudly
proclaimed
their
hostility
to
the
irish
and
roberts
persisted
in
challenging
them
as
his
counsel
would
not
in
vain
judge
blackburn
threatened
to
commit
the
rebellious
solicitor
these
men
lives
are
at
stake
my
lord
was
his
indignant
plea
remove
that
man
cried
the
angry
judge
but
as
the
officers
of
the
court
came
forward
very
slowly
for
all
poor
men
loved
and
honoured
the
sturdy
fighter
he
changed
his
mind
and
let
him
stay
despite
all
his
efforts
the
jury
contained
a
man
who
had
declared
that
he
did
care
what
the
evidence
was
he
would
hang
every
d
d
irishman
of
the
lot
and
the
result
showed
that
he
was
not
alone
in
his
view
for
evidence
of
the
most
disreputable
kind
was
admitted
women
of
the
lowest
type
were
put
into
the
box
as
witnesses
and
their
word
taken
as
unchallengeable
thus
was
destroyed
an
for
maguire
afterwards
accepted
by
the
crown
a
free
pardon
being
issued
on
the
strength
of
it
nothing
could
save
the
doomed
men
from
the
determined
verdict
and
i
could
see
from
where
i
was
sitting
into
a
little
room
behind
the
bench
where
an
official
was
quietly
preparing
the
black
caps
before
the
verdict
had
been
delivered
the
foregone
guilty
was
duly
repeated
as
verdict
on
each
of
the
five
cases
and
the
prisoners
asked
if
they
had
anything
to
say
why
sentence
of
death
should
not
be
passed
on
them
allen
boy
as
he
was
made
a
very
brave
and
manly
speech
he
had
not
fired
save
in
the
air
if
he
had
done
so
he
might
have
escaped
he
had
helped
to
free
kelly
and
deasy
and
did
not
regret
it
he
was
willing
to
die
for
ireland
maguire
and
condon
he
also
was
reprieved
declared
they
were
not
present
but
like
allen
were
ready
to
die
for
their
country
sentence
of
death
was
passed
and
as
echo
to
the
sardonic
the
lord
have
mercy
on
your
souls
rang
back
from
the
dock
in
five
clear
voices
with
never
a
quiver
of
fear
in
them
god
save
ireland
and
the
men
passed
one
by
one
from
the
sight
of
my
eyes
it
was
a
sorrowful
time
that
followed
the
despair
of
the
girl
who
was
allen
sweetheart
and
who
cried
to
us
on
her
knees
save
my
william
was
hard
to
see
nothing
we
or
any
one
could
do
availed
to
avert
the
doom
and
on
november
allen
larkin
and
were
hanged
outside
salford
gaol
had
they
striven
for
freedom
in
italy
england
would
have
honoured
them
here
she
buried
them
as
common
murderers
in
quicklime
in
the
prison
yard
i
have
found
with
a
keen
sense
of
pleasure
that
bradlaugh
and
myself
were
in
to
some
extent
although
we
knew
not
of
each
other
existence
and
although
he
was
doing
much
and
i
only
giving
such
poor
sympathy
as
a
young
girl
might
who
was
only
just
awakening
to
the
duty
of
political
work
i
read
in
the
for
november
that
in
the
preceding
week
he
was
pleading
on
clerkenwell
green
for
these
men
lives
according
to
the
evidence
at
the
trial
deasy
and
kelly
were
illegally
arrested
they
had
been
arrested
for
vagrancy
of
which
no
evidence
was
given
and
apparently
remanded
for
felony
without
a
shadow
of
justification
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
in
england
the
same
state
of
things
existed
as
in
ireland
he
had
yet
to
learn
that
an
illegal
arrest
was
sufficient
ground
to
detain
any
of
the
citizens
of
any
country
in
the
prisons
of
this
one
if
he
were
illegally
held
he
was
justified
in
using
enough
force
to
procure
his
release
wearing
a
policeman
coat
gave
no
authority
when
the
officer
exceeded
his
jurisdiction
he
had
argued
this
before
lord
chief
justice
erie
in
the
court
of
common
pleas
and
that
learned
judge
did
not
venture
to
contradict
the
argument
which
he
submitted
there
was
another
reason
why
they
should
spare
these
men
although
he
hardly
expected
the
government
to
listen
because
the
government
sent
down
one
of
the
judges
who
was
predetermined
to
convict
the
prisoners
it
was
that
the
offence
was
purely
a
political
one
the
death
of
brett
was
a
sad
mischance
but
no
one
who
read
the
evidence
could
regard
the
killing
of
brett
as
an
intentional
murder
legally
it
was
murder
morally
it
was
homicide
in
the
rescue
of
a
political
captive
if
it
were
a
question
of
the
rescue
of
the
political
captives
of
varignano
or
of
political
captives
in
bourbon
in
naples
or
in
poland
or
in
paris
even
earls
might
be
found
so
to
argue
wherein
is
our
sister
ireland
less
than
these
in
executing
these
men
they
would
throw
down
the
gauntlet
for
terrible
reprisals
it
was
a
grave
and
solemn
question
it
had
been
said
by
a
previous
speaker
that
they
were
prepared
to
go
to
any
lengths
to
save
these
irishmen
they
were
not
he
wished
they
were
if
they
were
if
the
men
of
england
from
one
end
to
the
other
were
prepared
to
say
men
shall
not
be
executed
they
would
not
be
he
was
afraid
they
had
not
pluck
enough
for
that
their
moral
courage
was
not
equal
to
their
physical
strength
therefore
he
would
not
say
that
they
were
prepared
to
do
so
they
must
plead
he
appealed
to
the
press
which
represented
the
power
of
england
to
that
press
which
in
its
moments
had
done
much
harm
and
which
ought
now
to
save
these
four
doomed
men
if
the
press
demanded
it
no
government
would
be
mad
enough
to
resist
the
memory
of
the
blood
which
was
shed
in
rose
up
like
a
bloody
ghost
against
them
he
only
feared
that
what
they
said
upon
the
subject
might
do
the
poor
men
more
harm
than
good
if
it
were
not
so
he
would
coin
words
that
should
speak
in
words
of
fire
as
it
was
he
could
only
say
to
the
government
you
are
strong
you
hold
these
men
lives
in
your
hands
but
if
you
want
to
reconcile
their
country
to
you
if
you
want
to
win
back
ireland
if
you
want
to
make
her
children
love
you
then
do
not
embitter
their
hearts
still
more
by
taking
the
lives
of
these
men
temper
your
strength
with
mercy
do
not
use
the
sword
of
justice
like
one
of
vengeance
for
the
day
may
come
when
it
shall
be
broken
in
your
hands
and
you
yourselves
brained
by
the
hilt
of
the
weapon
you
have
so
wickedly
wielded
in
october
he
had
printed
a
plea
for
ireland
strong
and
earnest
asking
where
is
our
boasted
english
freedom
when
you
cross
to
kingstown
pier
where
has
it
been
for
near
two
years
the
habeas
corpus
act
suspended
the
gaols
crowded
the
steamers
searched
spies
listening
at
shebeen
shops
for
sedition
and
the
end
of
it
a
fenian
panic
in
england
oh
before
it
be
too
late
before
more
blood
stain
the
pages
of
our
present
history
before
we
exasperate
and
arouse
bitter
animosities
let
us
try
and
do
justice
to
our
sister
land
abolish
once
and
for
all
the
land
laws
which
in
their
iniquitous
operation
have
ruined
her
peasantry
sweep
away
the
church
which
has
sucked
her
vitality
and
has
given
her
back
no
word
even
of
comfort
in
her
degradation
turn
her
barracks
into
flax
mills
encourage
a
spirit
of
independence
in
her
citizens
restore
to
her
people
the
protection
of
the
law
so
that
they
may
speak
without
fear
of
arrest
and
beg
them
to
plainly
and
boldly
state
their
grievances
let
a
commission
of
the
best
and
wisest
amongst
irishmen
with
some
of
our
highest
english
judges
added
sit
solemnly
to
hear
all
complaints
and
then
let
us
honestly
legislate
not
for
the
punishment
of
the
discontented
but
to
remove
the
causes
of
the
discontent
it
is
not
the
fenians
who
have
depopulated
strength
and
increased
her
misery
it
is
not
the
fenians
who
have
evicted
tenants
by
the
score
it
is
not
the
fenians
who
have
checked
cultivation
those
who
have
caused
the
wrong
at
least
should
frame
the
remedy
in
december
i
sailed
out
of
the
safe
harbour
of
my
happy
and
peaceful
girlhood
on
to
the
wide
sea
of
life
and
the
waves
broke
roughly
as
soon
as
the
bar
was
crossed
we
were
an
pair
my
husband
and
i
from
the
very
outset
he
with
very
high
ideas
of
a
husband
authority
and
a
wife
submission
holding
strongly
to
the
theory
thinking
much
of
the
details
of
home
arrangements
precise
methodical
easily
angered
and
with
difficulty
appeased
i
accustomed
to
freedom
indifferent
to
home
details
impulsive
very
and
proud
as
lucifer
i
had
never
had
a
harsh
word
spoken
to
me
never
been
ordered
to
do
anything
had
had
my
way
smoothed
for
my
feet
and
never
a
worry
had
touched
me
harshness
roused
first
incredulous
wonder
then
a
storm
of
indignant
tears
and
after
a
time
a
proud
defiant
resistance
cold
and
hard
as
iron
the
sunshiny
enthusiastic
girl
changed
and
changed
pretty
rapidly
into
a
grave
proud
reticent
woman
burying
deep
in
her
own
heart
all
her
hopes
her
fears
and
her
disillusions
i
must
have
been
a
very
unsatisfactory
wife
from
the
beginning
though
i
think
other
treatment
might
gradually
have
turned
me
into
a
fair
imitation
of
the
proper
conventional
article
beginning
with
the
ignorance
before
alluded
to
and
so
scared
and
outraged
at
heart
from
the
very
first
knowing
nothing
of
household
management
or
economical
use
of
money
i
had
never
had
an
allowance
or
even
bought
myself
a
pair
of
gloves
though
eager
to
perform
my
new
duties
creditably
unwilling
to
potter
over
little
things
and
liking
to
do
swiftly
what
i
had
to
do
and
then
turn
to
my
beloved
books
at
heart
fretting
for
my
mother
but
rarely
speaking
of
her
as
i
found
my
longing
for
her
presence
raised
jealous
vexation
with
strangers
about
me
with
whom
i
had
no
sympathy
visited
by
ladies
who
talked
to
me
only
about
babies
and
servants
troubles
of
which
i
knew
nothing
and
which
bored
me
unutterably
and
who
were
as
uninterested
in
all
that
had
filled
my
life
in
theology
in
politics
in
science
as
i
was
uninterested
in
the
discussions
on
the
housemaid
young
man
and
on
the
extravagance
in
using
butter
when
dripping
would
have
done
perfectly
well
my
dear
was
it
wonderful
that
i
became
timid
dull
and
depressed
all
my
eager
passionate
enthusiasm
so
attractive
to
men
in
a
young
girl
were
doubtless
incompatible
with
the
solid
comfort
of
a
wife
and
i
must
have
been
inexpressibly
tiring
to
the
rev
frank
besant
and
in
truth
i
ought
never
to
have
married
for
under
the
soft
loving
pliable
girl
there
lay
hidden
as
much
unknown
to
herself
as
to
her
surroundings
a
woman
of
strong
dominant
will
strength
that
panted
for
expression
and
rebelled
against
restraint
fiery
and
passionate
emotions
that
were
seething
under
compression
a
most
undesirable
partner
to
sit
in
the
lady
on
the
domestic
rug
before
the
fire
le
diable
dans
cette
galère
i
have
often
thought
looking
back
at
my
past
self
and
asking
why
did
that
foolish
girl
make
her
bed
so
foolishly
but
shows
the
contradictories
in
my
nature
that
led
me
into
so
mistaken
a
course
i
have
ever
been
the
queerest
mixture
of
weakness
and
strength
and
have
paid
heavily
for
the
weakness
as
a
child
i
used
to
suffer
tortures
of
shyness
and
if
my
was
untied
would
feel
shamefacedly
that
every
eye
was
fixed
on
the
unlucky
string
as
a
girl
i
would
shrink
away
from
strangers
and
think
myself
unwanted
and
unliked
so
that
i
was
full
of
eager
gratitude
to
any
one
who
noticed
me
kindly
as
the
young
mistress
of
a
house
i
was
afraid
of
my
servants
and
would
let
careless
work
pass
rather
than
bear
the
pain
of
reproving
the
when
i
have
been
lecturing
and
debating
with
no
lack
of
spirit
on
the
platform
i
have
preferred
to
go
without
what
i
wanted
at
the
hotel
rather
than
to
ring
and
make
the
waiter
fetch
it
combative
on
the
platform
in
defence
of
any
cause
i
cared
for
i
shrink
from
quarrel
or
disapproval
in
the
home
and
am
a
coward
at
heart
in
private
while
a
good
fighter
in
public
how
often
have
i
passed
unhappy
quarters
of
an
hour
screwing
up
my
courage
to
find
fault
with
some
subordinate
whom
my
duty
compelled
me
to
reprove
and
how
often
have
i
jeered
at
myself
for
a
fraud
as
the
doughty
platform
combatant
when
shrinking
from
blaming
some
lad
or
lass
for
doing
their
work
badly
an
unkind
look
or
word
has
availed
to
make
me
shrink
into
myself
as
a
snail
into
its
shell
while
on
the
platform
opposition
makes
me
speak
my
best
so
i
slid
into
marriage
blindly
and
stupidly
fearing
to
give
pain
fretted
my
heart
out
for
a
year
then
roused
by
harshness
and
injustice
stiffened
and
hardened
and
lived
with
a
wall
of
ice
round
me
within
which
i
waged
mental
conflicts
that
nearly
killed
me
and
learned
at
last
how
to
live
and
work
in
armour
that
turned
the
edge
of
the
weapons
that
struck
it
and
left
the
flesh
beneath
unwounded
armour
laid
aside
but
in
the
presence
of
a
very
few
my
first
serious
attempts
at
writing
were
made
in
and
i
took
up
two
very
different
lines
of
composition
i
wrote
some
short
stories
of
a
very
flimsy
type
and
also
a
work
of
a
much
more
ambitious
character
the
lives
of
the
black
letter
saints
for
the
sake
of
the
unecclesiastically
trained
it
may
be
as
well
to
mention
that
in
the
calendar
of
the
church
of
england
there
are
a
number
of
saints
days
some
of
these
are
printed
in
red
and
are
red
letter
days
for
which
services
are
appointed
by
the
church
others
are
printed
in
black
and
are
black
letter
days
and
have
no
special
services
fixed
for
them
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
would
be
interesting
to
take
each
of
these
days
and
write
a
sketch
of
the
life
of
the
saint
belonging
to
it
and
accordingly
i
set
to
work
to
do
so
and
gathered
various
books
of
history
and
legend
to
collect
my
facts
i
do
not
in
the
least
know
what
became
of
that
valuable
book
i
tried
macmillans
with
it
and
it
was
sent
on
by
them
to
some
one
who
was
preparing
a
series
of
church
books
for
the
young
later
i
had
a
letter
from
a
church
brotherhood
offering
to
publish
it
if
i
would
give
it
as
an
act
of
piety
to
their
order
its
ultimate
fate
is
to
me
unknown
the
short
stories
were
more
fortunate
i
sent
the
first
to
the
and
some
weeks
afterwards
received
a
letter
from
which
dropped
a
cheque
as
i
opened
it
dear
me
i
have
earned
a
good
deal
of
money
since
by
my
pen
but
never
any
that
gave
me
the
intense
delight
of
that
first
thirty
shillings
it
was
the
first
money
i
had
ever
earned
and
the
pride
of
the
earning
was
added
to
the
pride
of
authorship
in
my
childish
delight
and
practical
religion
i
went
down
on
my
knees
and
thanked
god
for
sending
it
to
me
and
i
saw
myself
earning
heaps
of
golden
guineas
and
becoming
quite
a
support
of
the
household
besides
it
was
my
very
own
i
thought
and
a
delightful
sense
of
independence
came
over
me
i
had
not
then
realised
the
beauty
of
the
english
law
and
the
dignified
position
in
which
it
placed
the
married
woman
i
did
not
understand
that
all
a
married
woman
earned
by
law
belonged
to
her
owner
and
that
she
could
have
nothing
that
belonged
to
her
of
right
i
did
not
want
the
money
i
was
only
so
glad
to
have
something
of
my
own
to
give
and
it
was
rather
a
shock
to
learn
that
it
was
not
really
mine
at
all
from
time
to
time
after
that
i
earned
a
few
pounds
for
stories
in
the
same
journal
and
the
let
me
say
has
one
peculiarity
which
should
render
it
beloved
by
poor
authors
it
pays
its
contributor
when
it
accepts
the
paper
whether
it
prints
it
immediately
or
not
thus
my
first
story
was
not
printed
for
some
weeks
after
i
received
the
cheque
and
it
was
the
same
with
all
the
others
accepted
by
the
same
journal
encouraged
by
these
small
successes
i
began
writing
a
novel
it
took
a
long
time
to
do
but
was
at
last
finished
and
sent
off
to
the
the
poor
thing
came
back
but
with
a
kind
note
telling
me
that
it
was
too
political
for
their
pages
but
that
if
i
would
write
one
of
purely
domestic
interest
and
up
to
the
same
level
it
would
probably
be
accepted
but
by
that
time
i
was
in
the
full
struggle
of
theological
doubt
and
that
novel
of
purely
domestic
interest
never
got
itself
written
i
contributed
further
to
the
literature
of
my
country
a
theological
pamphlet
of
which
i
forget
the
exact
title
but
it
dealt
with
the
duty
of
fasting
incumbent
on
all
faithful
christians
and
was
very
patristic
in
its
tone
in
january
my
little
son
was
born
and
as
i
was
very
ill
for
some
months
before
and
was
far
too
much
interested
in
the
tiny
creature
afterwards
to
devote
myself
to
pen
and
paper
my
literary
career
was
checked
for
a
while
the
baby
gave
a
new
interest
and
a
new
pleasure
to
life
and
as
we
could
not
afford
a
nurse
i
had
plenty
to
do
in
looking
after
his
small
majesty
my
energy
in
reading
became
less
feverish
when
it
was
done
by
the
side
of
the
baby
cradle
and
the
little
one
presence
almost
healed
the
abiding
pain
of
my
loss
i
may
pass
very
quickly
over
the
next
two
years
in
august
a
little
sister
was
born
to
my
son
and
the
recovery
was
slow
and
tedious
for
my
general
health
had
been
failing
for
some
time
illustration
a
photograph
by
dighton
art
studio
annie
besant
the
boy
was
a
bright
healthy
little
fellow
but
the
girl
was
delicate
from
birth
suffering
from
her
mother
unhappiness
and
born
somewhat
prematurely
in
consequence
of
a
shock
when
in
the
spring
of
the
two
children
caught
the
whooping
cough
my
mabel
delicacy
made
the
ordeal
fatal
to
her
she
was
very
young
for
so
trying
a
disease
and
after
a
while
bronchitis
set
in
and
was
followed
by
congestion
of
the
lungs
for
weeks
she
lay
in
hourly
peril
of
death
we
arranged
a
screen
round
the
fire
like
a
tent
and
kept
it
full
of
steam
to
ease
the
panting
breath
and
there
i
sat
day
and
night
all
through
those
weary
weeks
the
tortured
baby
on
my
knees
i
loved
my
little
ones
passionately
for
their
clinging
love
soothed
the
aching
at
my
heart
and
their
baby
eyes
could
not
critically
scan
the
unhappiness
that
grew
deeper
month
by
month
and
that
tent
became
my
world
and
there
alone
i
fought
with
death
for
my
child
the
doctor
said
that
recovery
was
impossible
and
that
in
one
of
the
paroxysms
of
coughing
she
must
die
the
most
distressing
thing
was
that
at
last
even
a
drop
or
two
of
milk
would
bring
on
the
terrible
convulsive
choking
and
it
seemed
cruel
to
add
to
the
pain
of
the
apparently
dying
child
at
length
one
morning
the
doctor
said
she
could
not
last
through
the
day
i
had
sent
for
him
hurriedly
for
the
body
had
suddenly
swollen
up
as
a
result
of
the
perforation
of
one
of
the
pleurae
and
the
consequent
escape
of
air
into
the
cavity
of
the
chest
while
he
was
there
one
of
the
fits
of
coughing
came
on
and
it
seemed
as
though
it
must
be
the
last
he
took
a
small
bottle
of
chloroform
out
of
his
pocket
and
putting
a
drop
on
a
handkerchief
held
it
near
the
child
face
till
the
drug
soothed
the
convulsive
struggle
it
do
any
harm
at
this
stage
he
said
and
it
checks
the
suffering
he
went
away
saying
that
he
feared
he
would
never
see
the
child
alive
again
one
of
the
kindest
friends
i
had
in
my
married
life
was
that
same
doctor
lauriston
winterbotham
he
was
as
good
as
he
was
clever
and
like
so
many
of
his
noble
profession
he
had
the
merits
of
discretion
and
silence
he
never
breathed
a
word
as
to
my
unhappiness
until
in
he
came
up
to
town
to
give
evidence
as
to
cruelty
which
had
the
deed
of
separation
not
been
held
as
condonation
would
have
secured
me
a
divorce
mensa
et
the
child
however
recovered
and
her
recovery
was
due
i
think
to
that
chance
thought
of
winterbotham
about
the
chloroform
for
i
used
it
whenever
the
first
sign
of
a
fit
of
coughing
appeared
and
so
warded
off
the
convulsive
attack
and
the
profound
exhaustion
that
followed
in
which
a
mere
flicker
of
breath
at
the
top
of
the
throat
was
the
only
sign
of
life
and
sometimes
even
that
disappeared
and
i
thought
her
gone
for
years
the
child
remained
ailing
and
delicate
requiring
the
tenderest
care
but
those
weeks
of
anguish
left
a
deeper
trace
on
mother
than
on
child
once
she
was
out
of
danger
i
collapsed
physically
and
lay
in
bed
for
a
week
unmoving
and
then
rose
to
face
a
struggle
which
lasted
for
three
years
and
two
months
and
nearly
cost
me
my
life
the
struggle
which
transformed
me
from
a
christian
into
an
atheist
the
agony
of
the
struggle
was
in
the
first
nineteen
months
a
time
to
be
looked
back
upon
with
shrinking
as
it
was
a
hell
to
live
through
at
the
time
for
no
one
who
has
not
felt
it
knows
the
fearful
anguish
inflicted
by
doubt
on
the
earnestly
religious
soul
there
is
in
life
no
other
pain
so
horrible
so
keen
in
its
torture
so
crushing
in
its
weight
it
seems
to
shipwreck
everything
to
destroy
the
one
steady
gleam
of
happiness
on
the
other
side
that
no
earthly
storm
could
obscure
to
make
all
life
gloomy
with
a
horror
of
despair
a
darkness
that
verily
may
be
felt
nothing
but
an
imperious
intellectual
and
moral
necessity
can
drive
into
doubt
a
religious
mind
for
it
is
as
though
an
earthquake
shook
the
foundations
of
the
soul
and
the
very
being
quivers
and
sways
under
the
shock
no
life
in
the
empty
sky
no
gleam
in
the
blackness
of
the
night
no
voice
to
break
the
deadly
silence
no
hand
outstretched
to
save
triflers
who
have
never
tried
to
think
who
take
their
creed
as
they
take
their
fashions
speak
of
atheism
as
the
outcome
of
foul
life
and
vicious
desires
in
their
shallow
heartlessness
and
shallower
thought
they
can
not
even
dimly
imagine
the
anguish
of
entering
the
mere
penumbra
of
the
eclipse
of
faith
much
less
the
horror
of
that
great
darkness
in
which
the
orphaned
soul
cries
out
into
the
infinite
emptiness
is
it
a
devil
that
has
made
the
world
is
the
echo
ye
have
no
father
true
is
all
blind
chance
is
all
the
clash
of
unconscious
forces
or
are
we
the
sentient
toys
of
an
almighty
power
that
sports
with
our
agony
whose
peals
of
awful
mockery
of
laughter
ring
back
answer
to
the
wailings
of
our
despair
how
true
are
the
noble
words
of
hamilton
king
for
some
may
follow
truth
from
dawn
to
dark
as
a
child
follows
by
his
mother
hand
knowing
no
fear
rejoicing
all
the
way
and
unto
some
her
face
is
as
a
star
set
through
an
avenue
of
thorns
and
fires
and
waving
branches
black
without
a
leaf
and
still
it
draws
them
though
the
feet
must
bleed
though
garments
must
be
rent
and
eyes
be
scorched
and
if
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
be
passed
and
to
the
level
road
they
come
still
with
their
faces
to
the
polar
star
it
is
not
with
the
same
looks
the
same
limbs
but
halt
and
maimed
and
of
infirmity
and
for
the
rest
of
the
way
they
have
to
go
it
is
not
day
but
night
and
oftentimes
a
night
of
clouds
wherein
the
stars
are
lost
aye
but
never
lost
is
the
star
of
truth
to
which
the
face
is
set
and
while
that
shines
all
lesser
lights
may
go
it
was
the
long
months
of
suffering
through
which
i
had
been
passing
with
the
seemingly
purposeless
torturing
of
my
little
one
as
a
climax
that
struck
the
first
stunning
blow
at
my
belief
in
god
as
a
merciful
father
of
men
i
had
been
visiting
the
poor
a
good
deal
and
had
marked
the
patient
suffering
of
their
lives
my
idolised
mother
had
been
defrauded
by
a
lawyer
she
had
trusted
and
was
plunged
into
debt
by
his
of
the
sums
that
should
have
passed
through
his
hands
to
others
my
own
bright
life
had
been
enshrouded
by
pain
and
rendered
to
me
degraded
by
an
intolerable
sense
of
bondage
and
here
was
my
helpless
sinless
babe
tortured
for
weeks
and
left
frail
and
suffering
the
smooth
brightness
of
my
previous
life
made
all
the
disillusionment
more
startling
and
the
sudden
plunge
into
conditions
so
new
and
so
unfavourable
dazed
and
stunned
me
my
religious
past
became
the
worst
enemy
of
the
suffering
present
all
my
personal
belief
in
christ
all
my
intense
faith
in
his
constant
direction
of
affairs
all
my
habit
of
continual
prayer
and
of
realisation
of
his
presence
all
were
against
me
now
the
very
height
of
my
trust
was
the
measure
of
the
shock
when
the
trust
gave
way
to
me
he
was
no
abstract
idea
but
a
living
reality
and
all
my
heart
rose
up
against
this
person
in
whom
i
believed
and
whose
individual
finger
i
saw
in
my
baby
agony
my
own
misery
the
breaking
of
my
proud
heart
under
a
load
of
debt
and
all
the
bitter
suffering
of
the
poor
the
presence
of
pain
and
evil
in
a
world
made
by
a
good
god
the
pain
falling
on
the
innocent
as
on
my
seven
months
old
babe
the
pain
begun
here
reaching
on
into
eternity
unhealed
a
world
a
lurid
hopeless
hell
all
these
while
i
still
believed
drove
me
desperate
and
instead
of
like
the
devils
believing
and
trembling
i
believed
and
hated
all
the
hitherto
dormant
and
unsuspected
strength
of
my
nature
rose
up
in
rebellion
i
did
not
yet
dream
of
denial
but
i
would
no
longer
kneel
as
the
first
stirrings
of
this
hot
rebellion
moved
in
my
heart
i
met
a
clergyman
of
a
very
noble
type
who
did
much
to
help
me
by
his
ready
and
wise
sympathy
besant
brought
him
to
see
me
during
the
crisis
of
the
child
illness
he
said
little
but
on
the
following
day
i
received
from
him
the
following
note
my
dear
besant
i
am
painfully
conscious
that
i
gave
you
but
little
help
in
your
trouble
yesterday
it
is
needless
to
say
that
it
was
not
from
want
of
sympathy
perhaps
it
would
be
nearer
the
truth
to
say
that
it
was
from
excess
of
sympathy
i
shrink
intensely
from
meddling
with
the
sorrow
of
any
one
whom
i
feel
to
be
of
a
sensitive
nature
heart
hath
its
own
bitterness
and
the
stranger
meddleth
not
therewith
it
is
to
me
a
positively
fearful
thought
that
i
might
awaken
such
a
reflection
as
common
was
the
commonplace
and
vacant
chaff
well
meant
for
grain
conventional
consolations
conventional
verses
out
of
the
bible
and
conventional
prayers
are
it
seems
to
me
an
intolerable
aggravation
of
suffering
and
so
i
acted
on
a
principle
that
i
mentioned
to
your
husband
that
is
no
power
so
great
as
that
of
one
human
faith
looking
upon
another
human
faith
the
promises
of
god
the
love
of
christ
for
little
children
and
all
that
has
been
given
to
us
of
hope
and
comfort
are
as
deeply
planted
in
your
heart
as
in
mine
and
i
did
not
care
to
quote
them
but
when
i
talk
face
to
face
with
one
who
is
in
sore
need
of
them
my
faith
in
them
suddenly
becomes
so
vast
and
that
i
think
i
must
help
most
by
talking
naturally
and
letting
the
faith
find
its
own
way
from
soul
to
soul
indeed
i
could
not
find
words
for
it
if
i
tried
and
yet
i
am
compelled
as
a
messenger
of
the
glad
tidings
of
god
to
solemnly
assure
you
that
all
is
well
we
have
no
key
to
the
of
pain
excepting
the
cross
of
christ
but
there
is
another
and
a
deeper
solution
in
the
hands
of
our
father
and
it
will
be
ours
when
we
can
understand
it
there
is
in
the
place
to
which
we
travelsome
blessed
explanation
of
your
baby
pain
and
your
grief
which
will
fill
with
light
the
darkest
heart
now
you
must
believe
without
having
seen
that
is
true
faith
you
must
a
hand
through
time
to
catch
the
interest
of
tears
that
you
may
have
strength
so
to
do
is
part
of
your
share
in
the
prayers
of
yours
very
faithfully
w
d
a
noble
letter
but
the
storm
was
beating
too
fiercely
to
be
stilled
and
one
night
in
that
summer
of
stands
out
clearly
before
me
besant
was
away
and
there
had
been
a
fierce
quarrel
before
he
left
i
was
outraged
desperate
with
no
door
of
escape
from
a
life
that
losing
its
hope
in
god
had
not
yet
learned
to
live
for
hope
for
man
no
door
of
escape
the
thought
came
like
a
flash
there
is
one
and
before
me
there
swung
open
with
lure
of
peace
and
of
safety
the
gateway
into
silence
and
security
the
gateway
of
the
tomb
i
was
standing
by
the
window
staring
hopelessly
at
the
evening
sky
with
the
thought
came
the
remembrance
that
the
means
was
at
hand
the
chloroform
that
had
soothed
my
baby
pain
and
that
i
had
locked
away
upstairs
i
ran
up
to
my
room
took
out
the
bottle
and
carried
it
downstairs
standing
again
at
the
window
in
the
summer
twilight
glad
that
the
struggle
was
over
and
peace
at
hand
i
uncorked
the
bottle
and
was
raising
it
to
my
lips
when
as
though
the
words
were
spoken
softly
and
clearly
i
heard
o
coward
coward
who
used
to
dream
of
martyrdom
and
can
not
bear
a
few
short
years
of
pain
a
rush
of
shame
swept
over
me
and
i
flung
the
bottle
far
away
among
the
shrubs
in
the
garden
at
my
feet
and
for
a
moment
i
felt
strong
as
for
a
struggle
and
then
fell
fainting
on
the
floor
only
once
again
in
all
the
strifes
of
my
career
did
the
thought
of
suicide
recur
and
then
it
was
but
for
a
moment
to
be
put
aside
as
unworthy
a
strong
soul
my
new
friend
d
proved
a
very
real
help
the
endless
torture
of
hell
the
vicarious
sacrifice
of
christ
the
trustworthiness
of
revelation
doubts
on
all
these
hitherto
accepted
doctrines
grew
and
heaped
themselves
on
my
bewildered
soul
my
questionings
were
neither
shirked
nor
discouraged
by
d
he
was
not
horrified
nor
was
he
sanctimoniously
rebukeful
but
met
them
all
with
a
wide
comprehension
inexpressibly
soothing
to
one
writhing
in
the
first
agonies
of
doubt
he
left
cheltenham
in
the
early
autumn
of
but
the
following
extracts
from
a
letter
written
in
november
will
show
the
kind
of
net
in
which
i
was
struggling
i
had
been
reading
campbell
work
on
the
atonement
you
forget
one
great
principle
that
god
is
impassive
can
not
suffer
christ
god
did
not
suffer
but
as
son
of
and
in
his
humanity
still
it
may
be
correctly
stated
that
he
felt
to
sin
and
sinners
god
eternally
feels
abhorrence
of
sin
and
love
of
the
but
to
infer
from
that
that
the
father
in
his
godhead
feels
the
sufferings
which
christ
experienced
solely
in
humanity
and
because
incarnate
is
i
think
wrong
i
felt
strongly
inclined
to
blow
you
up
for
the
last
part
of
your
letter
you
assume
i
think
quite
gratuitously
that
god
condemns
the
major
part
of
his
children
to
objectless
future
suffering
you
say
that
if
he
does
not
he
places
a
book
in
their
hands
which
threatens
what
he
does
not
mean
to
inflict
but
how
utterly
this
seems
to
me
opposed
to
the
gospel
of
christ
all
christ
references
to
eternal
punishment
may
be
resolved
into
references
to
the
valley
of
hinnom
by
way
of
imagery
with
the
exception
of
the
dives
parable
where
is
distinctly
inferred
a
moral
amendment
beyond
the
grave
i
speak
of
the
unselfish
desire
of
dives
to
save
his
brothers
the
more
i
see
of
the
controversy
the
more
baseless
does
the
eternal
punishment
theory
appear
it
seems
then
to
me
that
instead
of
feeling
aggrieved
and
shaken
you
ought
to
feel
encouraged
and
thankful
that
god
is
so
much
better
than
you
were
taught
to
believe
him
you
will
have
discovered
by
this
time
in
is
revelation
i
suppose
you
have
the
too
that
god
truth
is
our
truth
and
his
love
is
our
love
only
more
perfect
and
full
there
is
no
position
more
utterly
defeated
in
modern
philosophy
and
theology
than
dean
mansel
attempt
to
show
that
love
justice
are
different
in
kind
from
ours
mill
and
maurice
from
totally
alien
points
of
view
have
shown
up
the
preposterous
nature
of
the
notion
a
good
deal
of
what
you
have
thought
is
i
fancy
based
on
a
strange
forgetfulness
of
your
former
experience
if
you
have
known
christ
whom
to
know
is
eternal
life
and
that
you
have
known
him
i
am
certain
can
you
really
say
that
a
few
intellectual
difficulties
nay
a
few
moral
difficulties
if
you
will
are
able
at
once
to
obliterate
the
testimony
of
that
higher
state
of
being
why
the
keynote
of
all
my
theology
is
that
christ
is
lovable
because
and
because
he
is
the
perfection
of
all
that
i
know
to
be
noble
and
generous
and
loving
and
tender
and
true
if
an
angel
from
heaven
brought
me
a
gospel
which
contained
doctrines
that
would
not
stand
the
test
of
such
perfect
lovableness
doctrines
hard
or
cruel
or
unjust
i
should
reject
him
and
his
trumpery
gospel
with
scorn
knowing
that
neither
could
be
christ
know
christ
and
judge
religions
by
him
do
judge
him
by
religions
and
then
complain
because
they
find
yourself
looking
at
him
through
a
glass
i
am
saturating
myself
with
maurice
who
is
the
antidote
given
by
god
to
this
age
against
all
dreary
doublings
and
temptings
of
the
devil
to
despair
many
a
one
in
this
age
of
controversy
over
all
things
once
held
sacred
has
found
peace
and
new
light
on
this
line
of
thought
and
has
succeeded
in
thus
reconciling
theological
doctrines
with
the
demands
of
the
conscience
for
love
and
justice
in
a
world
made
by
a
just
and
loving
god
i
could
not
do
so
the
awakening
to
what
the
world
was
to
the
facts
of
human
misery
to
the
ruthless
tramp
of
nature
and
of
events
over
the
human
heart
making
no
difference
between
innocent
and
guilty
the
shock
had
been
too
great
for
the
equilibrium
to
be
restored
by
arguments
that
appealed
to
the
emotions
and
left
the
intellect
unconvinced
months
of
this
mental
anguish
wrought
their
natural
effects
on
physical
health
and
at
last
i
broke
down
completely
and
lay
for
weeks
helpless
and
prostrate
in
raging
and
unceasing
unable
to
sleep
unable
to
bear
the
light
lying
like
a
log
on
the
bed
not
unconscious
but
indifferent
to
everything
consciousness
centred
as
it
were
in
the
ceaseless
pain
the
doctor
tried
every
form
of
relief
but
entrenched
in
its
citadel
the
pain
defied
his
puny
efforts
he
covered
my
head
with
ice
he
gave
me
opium
which
only
drove
me
mad
he
did
all
that
skill
and
kindness
could
do
but
all
in
vain
finally
the
pain
wore
itself
out
and
the
moment
he
dared
to
do
so
he
tried
mental
diversion
he
brought
me
books
on
anatomy
on
science
and
persuaded
me
to
study
them
and
out
of
his
busy
life
would
steal
an
hour
to
explain
to
me
knotty
points
on
physiology
he
saw
that
if
i
were
to
be
brought
back
to
reasonable
life
it
could
only
be
by
diverting
thought
from
the
channels
in
which
the
current
had
been
running
to
a
dangerous
extent
i
have
often
felt
that
i
owed
life
and
sanity
to
that
good
man
who
felt
for
the
helpless
bewildered
beaten
down
by
the
cyclone
of
doubt
and
misery
so
it
will
easily
be
understood
that
my
religious
wretchedness
only
increased
the
unhappiness
of
homelife
for
how
absurd
it
was
that
any
reasonable
human
being
should
be
so
tossed
with
anguish
over
intellectual
and
moral
difficulties
on
religious
matters
and
should
make
herself
ill
over
these
unsubstantial
troubles
surely
it
was
a
woman
business
to
attend
to
her
husband
comforts
and
to
see
after
her
children
and
not
to
break
her
heart
over
misery
here
and
hell
hereafter
and
distract
her
brain
with
questions
that
had
puzzled
the
greatest
thinkers
and
still
remained
unsolved
and
truly
women
or
men
who
get
themselves
concerned
about
the
universe
at
large
would
do
well
not
to
plunge
hastily
into
marriage
for
they
do
not
run
smoothly
in
the
of
that
honourable
estate
und
should
be
faced
alone
and
the
soul
should
go
out
alone
into
the
wilderness
to
be
tempted
of
the
devil
and
not
bring
his
majesty
and
all
his
imps
into
the
placid
circle
of
the
home
unhappy
they
who
go
into
marriage
with
the
glamour
of
youth
upon
them
and
the
destiny
of
conflict
imprinted
on
their
nature
for
they
make
misery
for
their
partner
in
marriage
as
well
as
for
themselves
and
if
that
partner
strong
in
traditional
authority
and
conventional
habits
seeks
to
break
in
the
turbulent
and
creature
well
it
comes
to
a
mere
trial
of
strength
and
endurance
whether
that
driven
creature
will
fall
panting
and
crushed
or
whether
it
will
turn
in
its
despair
assert
its
divine
right
to
intellectual
liberty
rend
its
fetters
in
pieces
and
discovering
its
own
strength
in
its
extremity
speak
at
all
risks
its
no
when
bidden
to
live
a
lie
when
that
physical
crisis
was
over
i
decided
on
my
line
of
action
i
resolved
to
take
christianity
as
it
had
been
taught
in
the
churches
and
carefully
and
thoroughly
examine
its
dogmas
one
by
one
so
that
i
should
never
again
say
i
believe
where
i
had
not
proved
and
that
however
diminished
my
area
of
belief
what
was
left
of
it
might
at
least
be
firm
under
my
feet
i
found
that
four
chief
problems
were
pressing
for
solution
and
to
these
i
addressed
myself
how
many
are
the
souls
facing
just
these
problems
and
disputing
every
inch
of
their
old
ground
of
faith
with
the
steadily
advancing
waves
of
historical
and
scientific
criticism
alas
for
the
many
canutes
as
the
waves
wash
over
their
feet
these
problems
were
the
eternity
of
punishment
after
death
the
meaning
of
goodness
and
love
as
applied
to
a
god
who
had
made
this
world
with
all
its
sin
and
misery
the
nature
of
the
atonement
of
christ
and
the
justice
of
god
in
accepting
a
vicarious
suffering
from
christ
and
a
vicarious
righteousness
from
the
sinner
the
meaning
of
inspiration
as
applied
to
the
bible
and
the
reconciliation
of
the
perfections
of
the
author
with
the
blunders
and
immoralities
of
the
work
it
will
be
seen
that
the
deeper
problems
of
religion
the
deity
of
christ
the
existence
of
god
the
immortality
of
the
soul
were
not
yet
brought
into
question
and
looking
back
i
can
not
but
see
how
orderly
was
the
progression
of
thought
how
steady
the
growth
after
that
first
terrible
earthquake
and
the
first
wild
swirl
of
agony
the
points
that
i
set
myself
to
study
were
those
which
would
naturally
be
first
faced
by
any
one
whose
first
rebellion
against
the
dogmas
of
the
churches
was
a
rebellion
of
the
moral
nature
rather
than
of
the
intellectual
a
protest
of
the
conscience
rather
than
of
the
brain
it
was
not
a
desire
for
moral
licence
which
gave
me
the
impulse
that
finally
landed
me
in
atheism
it
was
the
sense
of
outraged
justice
and
insulted
right
i
was
a
wife
and
mother
blameless
in
moral
life
with
a
deep
sense
of
duty
and
a
proud
it
was
while
i
was
this
that
doubt
struck
me
and
while
i
was
in
the
guarded
circle
of
the
home
with
no
dream
of
outside
work
or
outside
liberty
that
i
lost
all
faith
in
christianity
my
education
my
mother
example
my
inner
timidity
and
all
fenced
me
in
from
temptations
from
without
it
was
the
uprising
of
an
outraged
conscience
that
made
me
a
rebel
against
the
churches
and
finally
an
unbeliever
in
god
and
i
place
this
on
record
because
the
progress
of
materialism
will
never
be
checked
by
diatribes
against
unbelievers
as
though
they
became
unbelievers
from
desire
for
vice
and
for
licence
to
do
evil
what
religion
has
to
face
in
the
controversies
of
is
not
the
unbelief
of
the
sty
but
the
unbelief
of
the
educated
conscience
and
of
the
soaring
intellect
and
unless
it
can
arm
itself
with
a
loftier
ethic
and
a
grander
philosophy
than
its
opponent
it
will
lose
its
hold
over
the
purest
and
the
strongest
of
the
younger
generation
chapter
the
storm
of
doubt
my
reading
of
heretical
and
broad
church
works
on
one
side
and
of
orthodox
ones
on
the
other
now
occupied
a
large
part
of
my
time
and
our
removal
to
sibsey
in
lincolnshire
an
agricultural
village
with
a
scattered
population
increased
my
leisure
i
read
the
works
of
robertson
stopford
brooke
stanley
greg
matthew
arnold
liddon
mansel
and
many
another
and
my
scepticism
grew
deeper
and
deeper
as
i
read
the
broad
church
arguments
appeared
to
me
to
be
of
the
nature
of
special
pleading
skilful
evasions
of
difficulties
rather
than
the
real
meeting
and
solving
of
them
for
the
problem
was
given
a
good
god
how
can
he
have
created
mankind
knowing
beforehand
that
the
vast
majority
of
those
whom
he
created
were
to
be
tortured
for
ever
given
a
just
god
how
can
he
punish
people
for
being
sinful
when
they
have
inherited
a
sinful
nature
without
their
own
choice
and
of
necessity
given
a
righteous
god
how
can
he
allow
sin
to
exist
for
ever
so
that
evil
shall
be
as
eternal
as
good
and
satan
shall
reign
in
hell
as
long
as
christ
in
heaven
worst
of
all
puzzles
perhaps
was
that
of
the
existence
of
evil
and
of
misery
and
the
racking
doubt
whether
god
be
good
and
yet
look
on
the
evil
and
the
misery
of
the
world
unmoved
and
untouched
it
seemed
so
impossible
to
believe
that
a
creator
could
be
either
cruel
enough
to
be
indifferent
to
the
misery
or
weak
enough
to
be
unable
to
stop
it
the
old
dilemma
faced
me
incessantly
if
he
can
prevent
it
and
does
not
he
is
not
good
if
he
wishes
to
prevent
it
and
can
not
he
is
not
almighty
i
racked
my
brains
for
an
answer
i
searched
writings
of
believers
for
a
clue
but
i
found
no
way
of
escape
not
yet
had
any
doubt
of
the
existence
of
god
crossed
my
mind
d
continued
to
write
me
striving
to
guide
me
along
the
path
which
had
led
his
own
soul
to
contentment
but
i
can
only
find
room
here
for
two
brief
extracts
which
will
show
how
to
himself
he
solved
the
problem
he
thought
me
mistaken
in
my
view
of
the
nature
of
the
and
which
is
supposed
to
grieve
god
i
take
it
that
sin
is
an
absolutely
necessary
factor
in
the
production
of
the
perfect
man
it
was
foreseen
and
allowed
as
means
to
an
end
as
in
fact
an
education
the
view
of
all
the
sin
and
misery
in
the
world
can
not
grieve
god
any
more
than
it
can
grieve
you
to
see
digby
fail
in
his
first
attempt
to
build
a
or
a
all
is
part
of
the
training
god
looks
at
the
ideal
man
to
which
all
tends
no
besant
i
never
feel
at
all
inclined
to
give
up
the
search
or
to
suppose
that
the
other
side
may
be
right
i
claim
no
merit
for
it
but
i
have
an
invincible
faith
in
the
morality
of
god
and
the
moral
order
of
the
world
i
have
no
more
doubt
about
the
falsehood
of
the
popular
theology
than
i
have
about
the
unreality
of
six
robbers
who
attacked
me
three
nights
ago
in
a
horrid
dream
i
exult
and
rejoice
in
the
grandeur
and
freedom
of
the
little
bit
of
truth
it
has
been
given
me
to
see
i
am
told
that
papers
by
bishop
ewing
edited
are
a
wonderful
help
many
of
them
to
puzzled
people
i
mean
to
get
them
but
i
am
sure
you
will
find
that
the
truth
will
even
so
little
as
we
may
be
able
to
find
out
grow
on
you
make
you
free
light
your
path
and
dispel
at
no
distant
time
your
difficulties
and
doubts
i
should
say
on
no
account
give
up
your
reading
i
think
with
you
that
you
could
not
do
without
it
it
will
be
a
wonderful
source
of
help
and
peace
to
you
for
there
are
struggles
far
more
fearful
than
those
of
intellectual
doubt
i
am
keenly
alive
to
the
sadness
of
which
your
last
two
pages
are
an
expression
i
was
sorrier
than
i
can
say
to
read
them
they
reminded
me
of
a
long
and
very
dark
time
in
my
own
life
when
i
thought
the
light
never
would
come
thank
god
it
came
or
i
think
i
could
not
have
held
out
much
longer
but
you
have
evidently
strength
to
bear
it
now
the
more
dangerous
time
i
should
fancy
has
passed
you
will
have
to
mind
that
the
fermentation
leaves
clear
spiritual
wine
and
not
as
too
often
vinegar
i
wish
i
could
write
something
more
helpful
to
you
in
this
great
matter
but
as
i
sit
in
front
of
my
large
bay
window
and
see
the
shadows
on
the
grass
and
the
sunlight
on
the
leaves
and
the
soft
glimmer
of
the
rosebuds
left
by
the
storms
i
can
but
believe
that
all
will
be
very
well
in
the
lord
wait
patiently
for
him
they
are
trite
words
but
he
made
the
grass
the
leaves
the
rosebuds
and
the
sunshine
and
he
is
the
father
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
and
now
the
trite
words
have
swelled
into
a
mighty
argument
i
found
more
help
in
theistic
writers
like
grey
and
agnostic
like
arnold
than
i
did
in
the
broad
church
teachers
but
these
of
course
served
to
make
return
to
the
old
faith
more
and
more
impossible
the
church
services
were
a
weekly
torture
but
feeling
as
i
did
that
i
was
only
a
doubter
i
kept
my
doubts
to
myself
it
was
possible
i
felt
that
all
my
difficulties
might
be
cleared
up
and
i
had
no
right
to
shake
the
faith
of
others
while
in
uncertainty
myself
others
had
doubted
and
had
afterwards
recovered
their
faith
for
the
doubter
silence
was
a
duty
the
blinded
had
better
keep
their
misery
to
themselves
during
these
weary
months
of
anxiety
and
torment
i
found
some
relief
from
the
mental
strain
in
practical
parish
work
nursing
the
sick
trying
to
brighten
the
lot
of
the
poor
i
learned
then
some
of
the
lessons
as
to
the
agricultural
labourer
and
the
land
that
i
was
able
in
to
teach
from
the
platform
the
movement
among
the
agricultural
labourers
due
to
the
energy
and
devotion
of
joseph
arch
was
beginning
to
be
discussed
in
the
fens
and
my
sympathies
went
strongly
with
the
claims
of
the
labourers
for
i
knew
their
in
one
cottage
i
had
found
four
generations
sleeping
in
one
room
the
and
his
wife
the
unmarried
grandmother
the
unmarried
mother
the
little
child
three
men
lodgers
completed
the
tale
of
eight
human
beings
crowded
into
that
narrow
garret
other
cottages
were
hovels
through
the
broken
roofs
of
which
poured
the
rain
and
wherein
rheumatism
and
ague
lived
with
the
human
dwellers
how
could
i
do
aught
but
sympathise
with
any
combination
that
aimed
at
the
raising
of
these
poor
but
the
agricultural
labourers
union
was
bitterly
opposed
by
the
farmers
and
they
would
give
no
work
to
a
union
man
one
example
may
serve
for
all
there
was
a
young
married
man
with
two
small
children
who
was
sinful
enough
to
go
to
a
union
meeting
and
sinful
enough
to
talk
of
it
on
his
return
home
no
farmer
would
employ
him
in
all
the
district
round
he
tramped
about
vainly
looking
for
work
grew
reckless
and
took
to
drink
visiting
his
cottage
consisting
of
one
room
and
a
i
found
his
wife
ill
with
fever
a
babe
in
her
arms
the
second
child
lying
dead
on
the
bed
in
answer
to
my
questions
yes
she
was
pining
starving
there
was
no
work
why
did
she
leave
the
dead
child
on
the
bed
because
she
had
no
other
place
for
it
till
the
coffin
came
and
at
night
the
unhappy
driven
man
the
wife
the
child
the
dead
child
all
lay
in
the
one
bed
the
farmers
hated
the
union
because
its
success
meant
higher
wages
for
the
men
and
it
never
struck
them
that
they
might
well
pay
less
rent
to
the
absent
landlord
and
higher
wage
to
the
men
who
tilled
their
fields
they
had
only
civil
words
for
the
burden
that
crushed
them
hard
words
for
the
mowers
of
their
harvests
and
the
of
their
ricks
they
made
common
cause
with
their
enemies
instead
of
with
their
friends
and
instead
of
leaguing
themselves
together
with
the
labourers
as
forming
together
the
true
agricultural
interest
they
leagued
themselves
with
the
landlords
against
the
labourers
and
so
made
ruinous
fratricidal
strife
instead
of
easy
victory
over
the
common
foe
and
seeing
all
this
i
learned
some
useful
lessons
and
the
political
education
progressed
while
the
theological
strife
went
on
within
in
the
early
autumn
a
ray
of
light
broke
the
darkness
i
was
in
london
with
my
mother
and
wandered
one
sunday
morning
into
hall
where
the
rev
charles
voysey
was
preaching
there
to
my
delight
i
found
on
listening
to
the
sermon
and
buying
some
literature
on
sale
in
the
that
there
were
people
who
had
passed
through
my
own
difficulties
and
had
given
up
the
dogmas
that
i
found
so
revolting
i
went
again
on
the
following
sunday
and
when
the
service
was
over
i
noticed
that
the
outgoing
stream
of
people
were
passing
by
and
voysey
and
that
many
who
were
evidently
strangers
spoke
a
word
of
thanks
to
him
as
they
went
on
moved
by
a
strong
desire
after
the
long
months
of
lonely
striving
to
speak
to
one
who
had
struggled
out
of
christian
difficulties
i
said
to
voysey
as
i
passed
in
my
turn
i
must
thank
you
for
very
great
help
in
what
you
said
this
morning
for
in
truth
never
having
yet
doubted
the
existence
of
god
the
teaching
of
voysey
that
he
was
loving
unto
man
and
his
tender
mercy
over
his
works
came
like
a
gleam
of
light
across
the
stormy
sea
of
doubt
and
distress
on
which
i
had
so
long
been
tossing
the
next
sunday
saw
me
again
at
the
hall
and
voysey
gave
me
a
cordial
invitation
to
visit
them
in
their
dulwich
home
i
found
their
theism
was
free
from
the
defects
that
had
revolted
me
in
christianity
and
they
opened
up
to
me
new
views
of
religion
i
read
theodore
parker
discourse
on
religion
francis
works
those
of
miss
frances
power
cobbe
and
of
others
the
anguish
of
the
tension
relaxed
the
nightmare
of
an
almighty
evil
passed
away
my
belief
in
god
not
yet
touched
was
cleared
from
all
the
dark
spots
that
had
sullied
it
and
i
no
longer
doubted
whether
the
dogmas
that
had
shocked
my
conscience
were
true
or
false
i
shook
them
off
once
for
all
with
all
their
pain
and
horror
and
darkness
and
felt
with
joy
and
relief
inexpressible
that
they
were
delusions
of
the
ignorance
of
man
not
the
revelations
of
a
god
but
there
was
one
belief
that
had
not
been
definitely
challenged
but
of
which
the
was
gone
with
the
orthodox
dogmas
now
definitely
renounced
the
doctrine
of
the
deity
of
christ
the
whole
teaching
of
the
broad
church
school
tends
of
course
to
emphasise
the
humanity
of
christ
at
the
expense
of
his
deity
and
when
eternal
punishment
and
the
substitutionary
atonement
had
gone
there
seemed
no
reason
remaining
sufficient
to
account
for
so
tremendous
a
miracle
as
the
incarnation
of
the
deity
in
the
course
of
my
reading
i
had
become
familiar
with
the
idea
of
avatâras
in
eastern
creeds
and
i
saw
that
the
incarnate
god
was
put
forward
as
a
fact
by
all
ancient
religions
and
thus
the
way
was
paved
for
challenging
the
especially
christian
teaching
when
the
doctrines
morally
repulsive
were
cleared
away
but
i
shrank
from
the
thought
of
placing
in
the
crucible
a
doctrine
so
dear
from
all
the
associations
of
the
past
there
was
so
much
that
was
soothing
and
ennobling
in
the
idea
of
a
union
between
man
and
god
between
a
perfect
man
and
a
divine
life
between
a
human
heart
and
an
almighty
strength
jesus
as
god
was
interwoven
with
all
art
and
all
beauty
in
religion
to
break
with
the
deity
of
jesus
was
to
break
with
music
with
painting
with
literature
the
divine
babe
in
his
arms
the
divine
man
in
his
passion
and
his
triumph
the
friend
of
man
encircled
with
the
majesty
of
the
godhead
did
inexorable
truth
demand
that
this
ideal
figure
with
all
its
pathos
its
beauty
its
human
love
should
pass
away
into
the
pantheon
of
the
dead
gods
of
the
past
nor
was
this
all
if
i
gave
up
belief
in
christ
as
god
i
must
give
up
christianity
as
creed
once
challenge
the
unique
position
of
the
christ
and
the
name
christian
seemed
to
me
to
be
a
hypocrisy
and
its
renouncement
a
duty
binding
on
the
upright
mind
i
was
a
wife
what
would
be
the
effect
of
such
a
step
hitherto
mental
pain
alone
had
been
the
price
demanded
inexorably
from
the
searcher
after
truth
but
with
the
renouncing
of
christ
outer
warfare
would
be
added
to
the
inner
and
who
might
guess
the
result
upon
my
life
the
struggle
was
keen
but
short
i
decided
to
carefully
review
the
evidence
for
and
against
the
deity
of
christ
with
the
result
that
that
belief
followed
the
others
and
i
stood
no
longer
christian
face
to
face
with
a
dim
future
in
which
i
sensed
the
coming
conflict
one
effort
i
made
to
escape
it
i
appealed
to
pusey
thinking
that
if
he
could
not
answer
my
questionings
no
answer
to
them
could
be
reasonably
hoped
for
i
had
a
brief
correspondence
with
him
but
was
referred
only
to
lines
of
argument
familiar
to
me
as
those
of
liddon
in
his
bampton
lectures
and
finally
on
his
invitation
went
down
to
oxford
to
see
him
i
found
a
short
stout
gentleman
dressed
in
a
cassock
looking
like
a
comfortable
monk
but
keen
eyes
steadfastly
gazing
straight
into
mine
told
of
the
force
and
subtlety
enshrined
in
the
fine
impressive
head
but
the
learned
doctor
took
the
wrong
line
of
treatment
he
probably
saw
i
was
anxious
shy
and
nervous
and
he
treated
me
as
a
penitent
going
to
confession
and
seeking
the
advice
of
a
director
instead
of
as
an
inquirer
struggling
after
truth
and
resolute
to
obtain
some
firm
in
the
sea
of
doubt
he
would
not
deal
with
the
question
of
the
deity
of
jesus
as
a
question
for
argument
you
are
speaking
of
your
judge
he
retorted
sternly
when
i
pressed
a
difficulty
the
mere
suggestion
of
an
imperfection
in
the
character
of
jesus
made
him
shudder
and
he
checked
me
with
raised
hand
you
are
blaspheming
the
very
thought
is
a
terrible
sin
would
he
recommend
me
any
books
that
might
throw
light
on
the
subject
no
no
you
have
read
too
much
already
you
must
pray
you
must
pray
when
i
urged
that
i
could
not
believe
without
proof
i
was
told
blessed
are
they
that
have
not
seen
and
yet
have
believed
and
my
further
questioning
was
checked
by
the
murmur
o
my
child
how
undisciplined
how
impatient
truly
he
must
have
found
in
me
hot
eager
passionate
in
my
determination
to
resolute
not
to
profess
belief
while
belief
was
absent
nothing
of
the
meek
chastened
submissive
spirit
with
which
he
was
wont
to
deal
in
penitents
seeking
his
counsel
as
their
spiritual
guide
in
vain
did
he
bid
me
pray
as
though
i
believed
in
vain
did
he
urge
the
duty
of
blind
submission
to
the
authority
of
the
church
of
blind
unreasoning
faith
that
questioned
not
i
had
not
trodden
the
thorny
path
of
doubt
to
come
to
the
point
from
which
i
had
started
i
needed
and
would
have
solid
grounds
ere
i
believed
he
had
no
conception
of
the
struggles
of
a
sceptical
spirit
he
had
evidently
never
felt
the
pangs
of
doubt
his
own
faith
was
solid
as
a
rock
firm
satisfied
unshakable
he
would
as
soon
have
committed
suicide
as
have
doubted
of
the
infallibility
of
the
universal
church
it
is
not
your
duty
to
ascertain
the
truth
he
told
me
sternly
it
is
your
duty
to
accept
and
believe
the
truth
as
laid
down
by
the
church
at
your
peril
you
reject
it
the
responsibility
is
not
yours
so
long
as
you
dutifully
accept
that
which
the
church
has
laid
down
for
your
acceptance
did
not
the
lord
promise
that
the
presence
of
the
spirit
should
be
ever
with
his
church
to
guide
her
into
all
truth
but
the
fact
of
the
promise
and
its
value
are
just
the
very
points
on
which
i
am
doubtful
i
answered
he
shuddered
pray
pray
he
said
father
forgive
her
for
she
knows
not
what
she
says
it
was
in
vain
that
i
urged
on
him
the
sincerity
of
my
seeking
pointing
out
that
i
had
everything
to
gain
by
following
his
directions
everything
to
lose
by
going
my
own
way
but
that
it
seemed
to
me
untruthful
to
pretend
to
accept
what
was
not
really
believed
everything
to
lose
yes
indeed
you
will
be
lost
for
time
and
lost
for
eternity
lost
or
not
i
rejoined
i
must
and
will
try
to
find
out
what
is
true
and
i
will
not
believe
till
i
am
sure
you
have
no
right
to
make

to
what
you
will
believe
or
what
you
will
not

you
are
full
of
intellectual
pride
i
sighed
hopelessly
little
feeling
of
pride
was
there
in
me
just
then
but
only
a
despairful
feeling
that
in
this
rigid
unyielding
dogmatism
there
was
no
comprehension
of
my
difficulties
no
help
for
me
in
my
strugglings
i
rose
and
thanking
him
for
his
courtesy
said
that
i
would
not
waste
his
time
further
that
i
must
go
home
and
face
the
difficulties
openly
leaving
the
church
and
taking
the
consequences
then
for
the
first
time
his
serenity
was
ruffled

forbid
you
to
speak

your
disbelief

cried
i
forbid
you
to
lead
into
your
own
lost
state

thomas
scott
slowly
and
sadly
i
took
my
way
back
to
the
station
knowing
that
my
last
chance
of
escape
had
failed
me
i
recognised
in
this
famous
divine
the
spirit
of
that
could
be
tender
and
pitiful
to
the
sinner
repentant
humble
submissive
but
that
was
iron
to
the
doubter
the
heretic
and
would
crush
out
all
questionings
of
revealed
truth
silencing
by
force
not
by
argument
all
challenge
of
the
traditions
of
the
church
out
of
such
men
were
made
the
inquisitors
of
the
middle
ages
perfectly
conscientious
perfectly
rigid
perfectly
merciless
to
the
heretic
to
them
heretics
are
centres
of
infectious
disease
and
charity
to
the
heretic
is
the
worst
cruelty
to
the
souls
of
men
certain
that
they
hold
by
no
merit
of
our
own
but
by
the
mercy
of
our
god
the
one
truth
which
he
has
revealed
they
can
permit
no
questionings
they
can
accept
nought
but
the
most
complete
submission
but
while
man
aspires
after
truth
while
his
mind
yearns
after
knowledge
while
his
intellect
soars
upward
into
the
empyrean
of
speculation
and
beats
the
air
with
tireless
wing
so
long
shall
those
who
demand
faith
from
him
be
met
by
challenge
for
proof
and
those
who
would
blind
him
shall
be
defeated
by
his
resolve
to
gaze
unblenching
on
the
face
of
truth
even
though
her
eyes
should
turn
him
into
stone
it
was
during
this
same
autumn
of
that
i
first
met
and
scott
introduced
to
them
by
voysey
at
that
time
thomas
scott
was
an
old
man
with
beautiful
white
hair
and
eyes
like
those
of
a
hawk
gleaming
from
under
shaggy
eyebrows
he
had
been
a
man
of
magnificent
physique
and
though
his
frame
was
then
enfeebled
the
splendid
head
kept
its
impressive
strength
and
beauty
and
told
of
a
unique
personality
well
born
and
wealthy
he
had
spent
his
earlier
life
in
adventure
in
all
parts
of
the
world
and
after
his
marriage
he
had
settled
down
at
ramsgate
and
had
made
his
home
a
centre
of
heretical
thought
his
wife
his
right
hand
as
he
justly
called
her
was
young
enough
to
be
his
daughter
a
sweet
strong
gentle
noble
woman
worthy
of
her
husband
and
than
that
no
higher
praise
could
be
spoken
scott
for
many
years
issued
monthly
a
series
of
pamphlets
all
heretical
though
very
varying
in
their
shades
of
thought
all
were
well
written
cultured
and
polished
in
tone
and
to
this
rule
scott
made
no
exception
his
writers
might
say
what
they
liked
but
they
must
have
something
to
say
and
must
say
it
in
good
english
his
correspondence
was
enormous
from
prime
ministers
downwards
at
his
house
met
people
of
the
most
varied
opinions
it
was
a
veritable
heretical
colenso
of
natal
edward
maitland
vansittart
neale
charles
bray
sarah
hennell
and
hundreds
more
clerics
and
laymen
scholars
and
thinkers
all
coming
to
this
one
house
to
which
the
was
gained
only
by
love
of
truth
and
desire
to
spread
freedom
among
men
for
thomas
scott
my
first
freethought
essay
was
written
a
few
months
after
on
the
deity
of
jesus
of
nazareth
by
the
wife
of
a
benefited
clergyman
my
name
was
not
mine
to
use
so
it
was
agreed
that
any
essays
from
my
pen
should
be
anonymous
and
now
came
the
return
to
sibsey
and
with
it
the
need
for
definite
steps
as
to
the
church
for
now
i
no
longer
doubted
i
had
rejected
and
the
time
for
silence
was
past
i
was
willing
to
attend
the
church
services
taking
no
part
in
any
not
directed
to
god
himself
but
i
could
no
longer
attend
the
holy
communion
for
in
that
service
full
of
recognition
of
jesus
as
deity
and
of
his
atoning
sacrifice
i
could
no
longer
take
part
without
hypocrisy
this
was
agreed
to
and
well
do
i
remember
the
pain
and
trembling
wherewith
on
the
first
sacrament
sunday
after
my
return
i
rose
and
left
the
church
that
the
wife
should
communicate
was
as
much
a
matter
of
course
as
that
the
vicar
should
administer
i
had
never
done
anything
in
public
that
would
draw
attention
to
me
and
a
feeling
of
deadly
sickness
nearly
overcame
me
as
i
made
my
exit
conscious
that
every
eye
was
on
me
and
that
my
would
be
the
cause
of
unending
comment
as
a
matter
of
fact
every
one
naturally
thought
i
was
taken
suddenly
ill
and
i
was
overwhelmed
with
calls
and
inquiries
to
any
direct
question
i
answered
quietly
that
i
was
unable
to
take
part
in
the
profession
of
faith
required
by
an
honest
communicant
but
the
statement
was
rarely
necessary
as
the
idea
of
heresy
in
a
vicar
wife
is
slow
to
suggest
itself
to
the
ordinary
bucolic
mind
and
i
proffered
no
information
where
no
question
was
asked
it
happened
that
shortly
after
that
to
me
memorable
christmas
of
a
sharp
epidemic
of
typhoid
fever
broke
out
in
the
village
of
sibsey
the
drainage
there
was
of
the
most
primitive
type
and
the
contagion
spread
rapidly
naturally
fond
of
nursing
i
found
in
this
epidemic
work
just
fitted
to
my
hand
and
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
be
able
to
lend
personal
help
that
made
me
welcome
in
the
homes
of
the
stricken
poor
the
mothers
who
slept
exhausted
while
i
watched
beside
their
darlings
bedsides
will
never
i
like
to
fancy
think
of
the
heretic
whose
hand
was
as
tender
and
often
more
skilful
than
their
own
i
think
mother
nature
meant
me
for
a
nurse
for
i
take
a
sheer
delight
in
nursing
any
one
provided
only
that
there
is
peril
in
the
sickness
so
that
there
is
the
strange
and
solemn
feeling
of
the
struggle
between
the
human
skill
one
wields
and
the
supreme
enemy
death
there
is
a
strange
fascination
in
fighting
death
step
by
step
and
this
is
of
course
felt
to
the
full
where
one
fights
for
life
as
life
and
not
for
a
life
one
loves
when
the
patient
is
beloved
the
struggle
is
touched
with
agony
but
where
one
fights
with
death
over
the
body
of
a
stranger
there
is
a
weird
enchantment
in
the
contest
without
personal
pain
and
as
one
forces
back
the
hated
foe
there
is
a
curious
triumph
in
the
feeling
which
marks
the
yielding
up
its
prey
as
one
snatches
back
to
earth
the
life
which
had
perished
the
spring
of
brought
me
knowledge
of
a
power
that
was
to
mould
much
of
my
future
life
i
delivered
my
first
lecture
but
delivered
it
to
rows
of
empty
pews
in
sibsey
church
a
queer
whim
took
me
that
i
would
like
to
know
how
it
felt
to
preach
and
vague
fancies
stirred
in
me
that
i
could
speak
if
i
had
the
chance
i
saw
no
platform
in
the
distance
nor
had
any
idea
of
possible
speaking
in
the
future
dawned
upon
me
but
the
longing
to
find
outlet
in
words
came
upon
me
and
i
felt
as
though
i
had
something
to
say
and
was
able
to
say
it
so
locked
alone
in
the
great
silent
church
whither
i
had
gone
to
practise
some
organ
exercises
i
ascended
the
pulpit
steps
and
delivered
my
first
lecture
on
the
inspiration
of
the
bible
i
shall
never
forget
the
feeling
of
power
and
delight
but
especially
of
power
that
came
upon
me
as
i
sent
my
voice
ringing
down
the
aisles
and
the
passion
in
me
broke
into
balanced
sentences
and
never
paused
for
musical
cadence
or
for
rhythmical
expression
all
i
wanted
then
was
to
see
the
church
full
of
upturned
faces
alive
with
throbbing
sympathy
instead
of
the
dreary
emptiness
of
silent
pews
and
as
though
in
a
dream
the
solitude
was
peopled
and
i
saw
the
listening
faces
and
the
eager
eyes
and
as
the
sentences
flowed
unbidden
from
my
lips
and
my
own
tones
echoed
back
to
me
from
the
pillars
of
the
ancient
church
i
knew
of
a
verity
that
the
gift
of
speech
was
mine
and
that
if
ever
and
then
it
seemed
so
impossible
if
ever
the
chance
came
to
me
of
public
work
this
power
of
melodious
utterance
should
at
least
win
hearing
for
any
message
i
had
to
bring
but
the
knowledge
remained
a
secret
all
to
my
own
self
for
many
a
long
month
for
i
quickly
felt
ashamed
of
that
foolish
speechifying
in
an
empty
church
but
foolish
as
it
was
i
note
it
here
as
it
was
the
first
effort
of
that
expression
in
spoken
words
which
later
became
to
me
one
of
the
deepest
delights
of
life
and
indeed
none
can
know
save
they
who
have
felt
it
what
joy
there
is
in
the
full
rush
of
language
that
moves
and
sways
to
feel
a
crowd
respond
to
the
lightest
touch
to
see
the
faces
brighten
or
darken
at
your
bidding
to
know
that
the
sources
of
human
emotion
and
human
passion
gush
forth
at
the
word
of
the
speaker
as
the
stream
from
the
riven
rock
to
feel
that
the
thought
which
thrills
through
a
thousand
hearers
has
its
impulse
from
you
and
throbs
back
to
you
the
fuller
from
a
thousand
is
there
any
emotional
joy
in
life
more
brilliant
than
this
fuller
of
passionate
triumph
and
of
the
very
essence
of
intellectual
delight
in
my
marriage
tie
was
broken
i
took
no
new
step
but
my
absence
from
the
communion
led
to
some
gossip
and
a
relative
of
besant
pressed
on
him
views
of
the
social
and
professional
dangers
which
would
accrue
if
my
heresy
became
known
my
health
never
really
restored
since
the
autumn
of
grew
worse
and
worse
serious
heart
trouble
having
arisen
from
the
constant
strain
under
which
i
lived
at
last
in
july
or
august
the
crisis
came
i
was
told
that
i
must
conform
to
the
outward
observances
of
the
church
and
attend
the
communion
i
refused
then
came
the
distinct
alternative
conformity
or
exclusion
from
home
in
other
words
hypocrisy
or
expulsion
i
chose
the
latter
a
bitterly
sad
time
followed
my
dear
mother
was
to
her
with
her
wide
and
vague
form
of
christianity
loosely
held
the
intensity
of
my
feeling
that
where
i
did
not
believe
i
would
not
pretend
belief
was
incomprehensible
she
recognised
far
more
fully
than
i
did
all
that
a
separation
from
my
home
meant
for
me
and
the
difficulties
that
would
surround
a
young
woman
not
yet
living
alone
she
knew
how
brutally
the
world
judges
and
how
the
mere
fact
that
a
woman
was
young
and
alone
justified
any
coarseness
of
slander
then
i
did
not
guess
how
cruel
men
and
women
could
be
how
venomous
their
tongues
now
knowing
it
having
faced
slander
and
lived
it
down
i
deliberately
say
that
were
the
choice
again
before
me
i
would
choose
as
i
chose
then
i
would
rather
go
through
it
all
again
than
live
in
society
under
the
burden
of
an
acted
lie
the
hardest
struggle
was
against
my
mother
tears
and
pleading
to
cause
her
pain
was
tenfold
pain
to
me
against
harshness
i
had
been
rigid
as
steel
but
it
was
hard
to
remain
steadfast
when
my
darling
mother
whom
i
loved
as
i
loved
nothing
else
on
earth
threw
herself
on
her
knees
before
me
imploring
me
to
yield
it
seemed
like
a
crime
to
bring
such
anguish
on
her
and
i
felt
as
a
murderer
as
the
snowy
head
was
pressed
against
my
knees
and
yet
to
live
a
lie
not
even
for
her
was
that
shame
possible
in
that
worst
crisis
of
blinding
agony
my
will
clung
fast
to
truth
and
it
is
true
now
as
it
ever
was
that
he
who
loves
father
or
mother
better
than
truth
is
not
worthy
of
her
and
the
path
of
honesty
is
the
way
to
light
and
peace
then
there
were
the
children
the
two
little
ones
who
worshipped
me
who
was
to
them
mother
nurse
and
playfellow
were
they
too
demanded
at
my
hands
not
wholly
for
a
time
facts
which
i
need
not
touch
on
here
enabled
my
brother
to
obtain
for
me
a
legal
separation
and
when
everything
was
arranged
i
found
myself
guardian
of
my
little
daughter
and
possessor
of
a
small
monthly
income
sufficient
for
respectable
starvation
with
a
great
price
i
had
obtained
my
freedom
but
i
was
free
home
friends
social
position
were
the
price
demanded
and
paid
and
being
free
i
wondered
what
to
do
with
my
freedom
i
could
have
had
a
home
with
my
brother
if
i
would
give
up
my
heretical
friends
and
keep
quiet
but
i
had
no
mind
to
put
my
limbs
into
fetters
again
and
in
my
youthful
inexperience
i
determined
to
find
something
to
do
the
difficulty
was
the
something
and
i
spent
various
shillings
in
agencies
with
a
quite
wonderful
unanimity
of
failures
i
tried
fancy
offered
to
ladies
in
reduced
circumstances
and
earned
by
some
weeks
of
stitching
i
experimented
with
a
birmingham
firm
who
generously
offered
every
one
the
opportunity
of
adding
to
their
incomes
and
on
sending
the
small
fee
demanded
received
a
with
an
explanation
that
i
was
to
sell
little
articles
of
that
description
going
as
far
as
to
my
friends
i
did
not
feel
equal
to
springing
and
on
my
acquaintances
so
did
not
enter
on
that
line
of
business
and
similar
failures
in
numerous
efforts
made
me
feel
as
so
many
others
have
found
that
the
is
hard
to
open
however
i
was
resolute
to
build
a
nest
for
my
wee
daughter
my
mother
and
myself
and
the
first
thing
to
do
was
to
save
my
monthly
pittance
to
buy
furniture
i
found
a
tiny
house
in
colby
road
upper
norwood
near
the
scotts
who
were
more
than
good
to
me
and
arranged
to
take
it
in
the
spring
and
then
accepted
a
loving
invitation
to
folkestone
where
my
grandmother
and
two
aunts
were
living
to
look
for
work
there
and
found
it
the
vicar
wanted
a
governess
and
one
of
my
aunts
suggested
me
as
a
and
thither
i
went
with
my
little
mabel
our
board
and
lodging
being
payment
for
my
work
i
became
head
cook
governess
and
nurse
glad
enough
to
have
found
something
to
do
that
enabled
me
to
save
my
little
income
but
i
do
not
think
i
will
ever
take
to
cooking
for
a
permanence
broiling
and
frying
are
all
right
and
making
is
rather
pleasant
but
saucepans
and
kettles
blister
your
hands
there
is
a
charm
in
making
a
stew
to
the
unaccustomed
cook
from
the
excitement
of
wondering
what
the
result
will
be
and
whether
any
flavour
save
that
of
onions
will
survive
the
competition
in
the
mixture
on
the
whole
my
cooking
strictly
by
cookery
book
was
a
success
but
my
sweeping
was
bad
for
i
lacked
muscle
this
curious
episode
came
to
an
abrupt
end
for
one
of
my
little
pupils
fell
ill
with
diphtheria
and
i
was
transformed
from
cook
to
nurse
mabel
i
despatched
to
her
grandmother
who
adored
her
with
a
love
condescendingly
returned
by
the
little
fairy
of
three
and
never
was
there
a
prettier
picture
than
the
curls
nestled
against
the
white
the
in
exquisite
contrast
with
the
worn
stateliness
of
her
tender
nurse
scarcely
was
my
little
patient
out
of
danger
when
the
youngest
boy
fell
ill
of
scarlet
fever
we
decided
to
isolate
him
on
the
top
floor
and
i
cleared
away
carpets
and
curtains
hung
sheets
over
the
doorways
and
kept
them
wet
with
chloride
of
lime
shut
myself
up
there
with
the
boy
having
my
meals
left
on
the
landing
and
when
all
risk
was
over
proudly
handed
back
my
charge
the
disease
touching
no
one
else
in
the
house
and
now
the
spring
of
had
come
and
in
a
few
weeks
my
mother
and
i
were
to
set
up
house
together
how
we
had
planned
all
and
had
knitted
on
the
new
life
together
we
anticipated
to
the
old
one
we
remembered
how
we
had
discussed
mabel
education
and
the
share
which
should
fall
to
each
never
to
be
realised
my
mother
went
up
to
town
and
in
a
week
or
two
i
received
a
telegram
saying
she
was
dangerously
ill
and
as
fast
as
express
train
would
take
me
i
was
beside
her
dying
the
doctor
said
three
days
she
might
live
no
more
i
told
her
the
but
she
said
resolutely
i
do
not
feel
that
i
am
going
to
die
just
yet
and
she
was
right
there
was
an
attack
of
fearful
prostration
the
valves
of
the
heart
had
failed
a
very
wrestling
with
death
and
then
the
grim
shadow
drew
backwards
i
nursed
her
day
and
night
with
a
very
desperation
of
tenderness
for
now
fate
had
touched
the
thing
dearest
to
me
in
life
a
second
horrible
crisis
came
and
for
the
second
time
her
tenacity
and
my
love
beat
back
the
she
did
not
wish
to
die
the
love
of
life
was
strong
in
her
i
would
not
let
her
die
between
us
we
kept
the
foe
at
bay
then
dropsy
supervened
and
the
end
loomed
slowly
sure
it
was
then
after
eighteen
months
abstention
that
i
took
the
sacrament
for
the
last
time
my
mother
had
an
intense
longing
to
communicate
before
she
died
but
absolutely
refused
to
do
so
unless
i
took
it
with
her
if
it
be
necessary
to
salvation
she
persisted
doggedly
i
will
not
take
it
if
darling
annie
is
to
be
shut
out
i
would
rather
be
lost
with
her
than
saved
without
her
i
went
to
a
clergyman
i
knew
well
and
laid
the
case
before
him
as
i
expected
he
refused
to
allow
me
to
communicate
i
tried
a
second
with
the
same
result
at
last
a
thought
struck
me
there
was
dean
stanley
my
mother
favourite
a
man
known
to
be
of
the
broadest
school
within
the
church
of
england
suppose
i
asked
him
i
did
not
know
him
and
i
felt
the
request
would
be
an
impertinence
but
there
was
just
the
chance
that
he
might
consent
and
what
would
i
not
do
to
make
my
darling
easier
i
said
nothing
to
any
one
but
set
out
to
the
deanery
westminster
timidly
asked
for
the
dean
and
followed
the
servant
upstairs
with
a
sinking
heart
i
was
left
for
a
moment
alone
in
the
library
and
then
the
dean
came
in
i
do
think
i
ever
in
my
life
felt
more
intensely
uncomfortable
than
i
did
in
that
interval
as
he
stood
waiting
for
me
to
speak
his
clear
grave
piercing
eyes
gazing
questioningly
into
mine
very
falteringly
it
must
have
been
very
clumsily
i
preferred
my
request
stating
boldly
with
abrupt
honesty
that
i
was
not
a
christian
that
my
mother
was
dying
that
she
was
fretting
to
take
the
sacrament
that
she
would
not
take
it
unless
i
took
it
with
her
that
two
clergymen
had
refused
to
allow
me
to
take
part
in
the
service
that
i
had
come
to
him
in
despair
feeling
how
great
was
the
intrusion
but
she
was
dying
his
face
changed
to
a
great
softness
you
were
quite
right
to
come
to
me
he
answered
in
that
low
musical
voice
of
his
his
keen
gaze
having
altered
into
one
no
less
direct
but
marvellously
gentle
of
course
i
will
go
and
see
your
mother
and
i
have
little
doubt
that
if
you
will
not
mind
talking
over
your
position
with
me
we
may
see
our
way
clear
to
doing
as
your
mother
wishes
i
could
barely
speak
my
thanks
so
much
did
the
kindly
sympathy
move
me
the
revulsion
from
the
anxiety
and
fear
of
rebuff
was
strong
enough
to
be
almost
pain
but
dean
stanley
did
more
than
i
asked
he
suggested
that
he
should
call
that
afternoon
and
have
a
quiet
chat
with
my
mother
and
then
come
again
on
the
following
day
to
administer
the
sacrament
a
stranger
presence
is
always
trying
to
a
sick
person
he
said
with
rare
delicacy
of
thought
and
joined
to
the
excitement
of
the
service
it
might
be
too
much
for
your
dear
mother
if
i
spend
half
an
hour
with
her
and
administer
the
sacrament
it
will
i
think
be
better
for
her
so
dean
stanley
came
that
afternoon
all
the
way
to
brompton
and
remained
talking
with
my
mother
for
about
half
an
hour
and
then
set
himself
to
understand
my
own
position
he
finally
told
me
that
conduct
was
far
more
important
than
theory
and
that
he
regarded
all
as
christians
who
recognised
and
tried
to
follow
the
moral
law
of
christ
on
the
question
of
the
absolute
deity
of
jesus
he
laid
but
little
stress
jesus
was
in
a
special
sense
the
son
of
god
but
it
was
folly
to
quarrel
over
words
with
only
human
meanings
when
dealing
with
the
mystery
of
the
divine
existence
and
above
all
it
was
folly
to
make
such
words
into
dividing
walls
between
earnest
souls
the
one
important
matter
was
the
recognition
of
duty
to
god
and
man
and
all
who
were
one
in
that
recognition
might
rightfully
join
in
an
act
of
worship
the
essence
of
which
was
not
acceptance
of
dogma
but
love
of
god
and
for
man
the
holy
communion
he
concluded
in
his
soft
tones
was
never
meant
to
divide
from
each
other
hearts
that
are
searching
after
the
one
true
god
it
was
meant
by
its
founder
as
a
symbol
of
unity
not
of
strife
on
the
following
day
dean
stanley
celebrated
the
holy
communion
by
the
bedside
of
my
dear
mother
and
well
was
i
repaid
for
the
struggle
it
had
cost
me
to
ask
so
great
a
kindness
from
a
stranger
when
i
saw
the
comfort
that
gentle
noble
heart
had
given
to
her
he
soothed
away
all
her
anxiety
about
my
heresy
with
tactful
wisdom
bidding
her
have
no
fear
of
differences
of
opinion
where
the
heart
was
set
on
truth
remember
she
told
me
he
said
to
her
remember
that
our
god
is
the
god
of
truth
and
that
therefore
the
honest
search
for
truth
can
never
be
displeasing
in
his
eyes
once
again
after
that
he
came
and
after
his
visit
to
my
mother
we
had
another
long
talk
i
ventured
to
ask
him
the
conversation
having
turned
that
way
how
with
views
so
broad
as
his
he
found
it
possible
to
remain
in
communion
with
the
church
of
england
i
think
he
answered
gently
that
i
am
of
more
service
to
true
religion
by
remaining
in
the
church
and
striving
to
widen
its
boundaries
from
within
than
if
i
left
it
and
worked
from
without
and
he
went
on
to
explain
how
as
dean
of
westminster
he
was
in
a
rarely
independent
position
and
could
make
the
abbey
of
a
wider
national
service
than
would
otherwise
be
possible
in
all
he
said
on
this
his
love
for
and
his
pride
in
the
glorious
abbey
were
manifest
and
it
was
easy
to
see
that
old
historical
associations
love
of
music
of
painting
of
stately
architecture
were
the
bonds
that
held
him
bound
to
the
old
historic
church
of
england
his
emotions
not
his
intellect
kept
him
churchman
and
he
shrank
with
the
of
the
cultured
scholar
from
the
idea
of
allowing
the
old
traditions
to
be
handled
roughly
by
inartistic
hands
naturally
of
a
refined
and
delicate
nature
he
had
been
rendered
yet
more
exquisitely
sensitive
by
the
training
of
the
college
and
the
court
the
polished
courtesy
of
his
manners
was
but
the
natural
expression
of
a
noble
and
lofty
mind
a
mind
whose
very
gentleness
sometimes
veiled
its
strength
i
have
often
heard
dean
stanley
harshly
spoken
of
i
have
heard
his
honesty
roughly
challenged
but
never
has
he
been
attacked
in
my
presence
that
i
have
not
uttered
my
protest
against
the
injustice
done
him
and
thus
striven
to
repay
some
small
fraction
of
that
great
debt
of
gratitude
which
i
shall
ever
owe
his
memory
and
now
the
end
came
swiftly
i
had
hurriedly
furnished
a
couple
of
rooms
in
the
little
house
now
ours
that
i
might
take
my
mother
into
the
purer
air
of
norwood
and
permission
was
given
to
drive
her
down
in
an
invalid
carriage
the
following
evening
she
was
suddenly
taken
worse
we
lifted
her
into
bed
and
telegraphed
for
the
doctor
but
he
could
do
nothing
and
she
herself
felt
that
the
hand
of
death
had
gripped
her
selfless
to
the
last
she
thought
but
for
my
loneliness
i
am
leaving
you
alone
she
sighed
from
time
to
time
and
truly
i
felt
with
an
anguish
i
did
not
dare
to
realise
that
when
she
died
i
should
indeed
be
alone
on
earth
for
two
days
longer
she
was
with
me
my
beloved
and
i
never
left
her
side
for
five
minutes
on
may
the
weakness
passed
into
gentle
delirium
but
even
then
the
faithful
eyes
followed
me
about
the
room
until
at
length
they
closed
for
ever
and
as
the
sun
sank
low
in
the
heavens
the
breath
came
slower
and
slower
till
the
silence
of
death
came
down
upon
us
and
she
was
gone
stunned
and
dazed
with
the
loss
i
went
mechanically
through
the
next
few
days
i
would
have
none
touch
my
dead
save
myself
and
her
favourite
sister
who
was
with
us
at
the
last
cold
and
i
remained
even
when
they
hid
her
from
me
with
the
even
all
the
dreary
way
to
kensal
green
where
her
husband
and
her
were
sleeping
and
when
we
left
her
alone
in
the
chill
earth
damp
with
the
rains
of
spring
i
could
not
believe
that
our
was
dead
and
buried
and
the
home
in
ruins
ere
yet
it
was
fairly
built
truly
my
house
was
left
unto
me
desolate
and
the
rooms
filled
with
sunshine
but
unlighted
by
her
presence
seemed
to
echo
from
their
bare
walls
you
are
all
alone
but
my
little
daughter
was
there
and
her
sweet
face
and
dancing
feet
broke
the
solitude
while
her
imperious
claims
for
love
and
tendance
forced
me
into
attention
to
the
daily
needs
of
life
and
life
was
hard
in
those
days
of
spring
and
summer
resources
small
and
work
difficult
to
find
in
truth
the
two
months
after
my
mother
death
were
the
dreariest
my
life
has
known
and
they
were
months
of
tolerably
hard
struggle
the
little
house
in
colby
road
taxed
my
slender
resources
heavily
and
the
search
for
work
was
not
yet
successful
i
do
not
know
how
i
should
have
managed
but
for
the
help
ever
at
hand
of
and
thomas
scott
during
this
time
i
wrote
for
scott
pamphlets
on
inspiration
atonement
mediation
and
salvation
eternal
torture
religious
education
of
children
natural
revealed
religion
and
the
few
guineas
thus
earned
were
very
valuable
their
house
too
was
always
open
to
me
and
this
was
no
small
help
for
often
in
those
days
the
little
money
i
had
was
enough
to
buy
food
for
two
but
not
enough
to
buy
it
for
three
and
i
would
go
out
and
study
all
day
at
the
british
museum
so
as
to
have
my
dinner
in
town
the
said
dinner
being
conspicuous
by
its
absence
if
i
was
away
for
two
evenings
running
from
the
hospitable
house
in
the
terrace
scott
would
come
down
to
see
what
had
happened
and
many
a
time
the
supper
there
was
of
real
physical
value
to
me
well
might
i
write
in
when
thomas
scott
lay
dead
it
was
thomas
scott
whose
house
was
open
to
me
when
my
need
was
sorest
and
he
never
knew
this
generous
noble
heart
how
sometimes
when
i
went
in
weary
and
overdone
from
a
long
day
study
in
the
british
museum
with
scarce
food
to
struggle
through
the
day
he
never
knew
how
his
genial
little
lady
in
welcoming
tone
cheered
the
then
utter
loneliness
of
my
life
to
no
living
man
save
one
do
i
owe
the
debt
of
gratitude
that
i
owe
to
thomas
scott
the
small
amount
of
jewellery
i
possessed
and
all
my
superfluous
clothes
were
turned
into
more
necessary
articles
and
the
child
at
least
never
suffered
a
solitary
touch
of
want
my
servant
mary
was
a
wonderful
contriver
and
kept
house
on
the
very
slenderest
funds
that
could
be
put
into
a
servant
hands
and
she
also
made
the
little
place
so
bright
and
that
it
was
always
a
pleasure
to
go
into
it
recalling
those
days
of
hard
living
i
can
now
look
on
them
without
regret
more
i
am
glad
to
have
passed
through
them
for
they
have
taught
me
how
to
sympathise
with
those
who
are
struggling
as
i
struggled
then
and
i
never
can
hear
the
words
fall
from
pale
lips
i
am
hungry
without
remembering
how
painful
a
thing
hunger
is
and
without
curing
that
pain
at
least
for
the
moment
the
presence
of
the
child
was
good
for
me
keeping
alive
my
aching
lonely
heart
she
would
play
contentedly
for
hours
while
i
was
working
a
word
now
and
again
being
enough
for
happiness
when
i
had
to
go
out
without
her
she
would
run
to
the
door
with
me
and
the
would
come
from
lips
she
was
ever
watching
at
the
window
for
my
return
and
the
sunny
face
was
always
the
first
to
welcome
me
home
many
and
many
a
time
have
i
been
coming
home
weary
hungry
and
and
the
glimpse
of
the
little
face
watching
has
reminded
me
that
i
must
not
carry
in
a
grave
face
to
sadden
my
darling
and
the
effort
to
throw
off
the
depression
for
her
sake
threw
it
off
altogether
and
brought
back
the
sunshine
she
was
the
sweetness
and
joy
of
my
life
my
darling
with
her
hair
and
glorious
eyes
and
passionate
wilful
loving
nature
the
torn
bruised
tendrils
of
my
heart
gradually
twined
round
this
little
life
she
gave
something
to
love
and
to
tend
and
thus
gratified

was

had

my

must
be
above
his
highest
creature
but
is
there
such
a
being
the
ground
says
the
rev
charles
voysey
on
which
our
belief
in
god
rests
is
man
man
parent
of
bibles
and
churches
inspirer
of
all
good
thoughts
and
good
deeds
man
the
masterpiece
of
god
thought
on
earth
man
the
of
all
spiritual
knowledge
neither
miraculous
nor
infallible
man
is
nevertheless
the
only
trustworthy
record
of
the
divine
mind
in
things
pertaining
to
god
man
reason
conscience
and
affections
are
the
only
true
revelation
of
his

but
what
if
god
were
only
own
image
reflected
in
the
mirror
of
man
mind
what
if
man
were
the
creator
not
the
revelation
of
his
god
it
was
inevitable
that
such
thoughts
should
arise
after
the
more
palpably
indefensible
doctrines
of
christianity
had
been
discarded
once
encourage
the
human
mind
to
think
and
bounds
to
the
thinking
can
never
again
be
set
by
authority
once
challenge
traditional
beliefs
and
the
challenge
will
ring
on
every
shield
which
is
hanging
in
the
intellectual
arena
around
me
was
the
atmosphere
of
conflict
and
freed
from
its
long
repression
my
mind
leapt
up
to
share
in
the
strife
with
a
joy
in
the
intellectual
tumult
the
intellectual
strain
i
often
attended
south
place
chapel
where
moncure
conway
was
then
preaching
and
discussion
with
him
did
something
towards
widening
my
views
on
the
deeper
religious
problems
i
dean
bampton
lectures
and
they
did
much
towards
turning
me
in
the
direction
of
atheism
i
mill
examination
of
sir
william
hamilton
philosophy
and
studied
carefully
comte
philosophie
positive
gradually
i
recognised
the
limitations
of
human
intelligence
and
its
incapacity
for
understanding
the
nature
of
god
presented
as
infinite
and
absolute
i
had
given
up
the
use
of
prayer
as
a
blasphemous
absurdity
since
an
god
could
not
need
my
suggestions
nor
an
god
require
my
promptings
but
god
fades
out
of
the
daily
life
of
those
who
never
pray
a
personal
god
who
is
not
a
providence
is
a
superfluity
when
from
the
heaven
does
not
smile
a
listening
father
it
soon
becomes
an
empty
space
whence
resounds
no
echo
of
man
cry
i
could
then
reach
no
loftier
conception
of
the
divine
than
that
offered
by
the
orthodox
and
that
broke
hopelessly
away
as
i
analysed
it
at
last
i
said
to
scott
scott
may
i
write
a
tract
on
the
nature
and
existence
of
god
he
glanced
at
me
keenly
ah
little
lady
you
are
facing
then
that
problem
at
last
i
thought
it
must
come
write
away
while
this
pamphlet
was
in
an
event
occurred
which
coloured
all
my
succeeding
life
i
met
charles
bradlaugh
one
day
in
the
late
spring
talking
with
conway
one
of
the
sweetest
and
steadiest
natures
whom
it
has
been
my
lot
to
meet
and
to
whom
as
to
her
husband
i
owe
much
for
kindness
generously
shown
when
i
was
poor
and
had
but
few
friends
she
asked
me
if
i
had
been
to
the
hall
of
science
old
street
i
answered
with
the
stupid
ignorant
reflection
of
other
people
prejudices
so
sadly
common
no
i
have
never
been
there
bradlaugh
is
rather
a
rough
sort
of
speaker
is
he
not
he
is
the
finest
speaker
of
that
i
have
ever
heard
she
answered
except
perhaps
john
bright
and
his
power
over
a
crowd
is
something
marvellous
whether
you
agree
with
him
or
not
you
should
hear
him
in
the
following
july
i
went
into
the
shop
of
edward
truelove
high
holborn
in
search
of
some
comtist
publications
having
come
across
his
name
as
a
publisher
in
the
course
of
my
study
at
the
british
museum
on
the
counter
was
a
copy
of
the
and
attracted
by
the
title
i
bought
it
i
read
it
placidly
in
the
omnibus
on
my
way
to
victoria
station
and
found
it
excellent
and
was
sent
into
convulsions
of
inward
merriment
when
glancing
up
i
saw
an
old
gentleman
gazing
at
me
with
horror
speaking
from
every
line
of
his
countenance
to
see
a
young
woman
respectably
dressed
in
crape
reading
an
atheistic
journal
had
evidently
upset
his
peace
of
mind
and
he
looked
so
hard
at
the
paper
that
i
was
tempted
to
offer
it
to
him
but
repressed
the
mischievous
inclination
this
first
copy
of
the
paper
with
which
i
was
to
be
so
closely
connected
bore
date
july
and
contained
two
long
letters
from
a
arnold
of
northampton
attacking
bradlaugh
and
a
brief
and
singularly
answer
from
the
latter
there
was
also
an
article
on
the
national
secular
society
which
made
me
aware
that
there
was
an
organisation
devoted
to
the
propagandism
of
free
thought
i
felt
that
if
such
a
society
existed
i
ought
to
belong
to
it
and
i
consequently
wrote
a
short
note
to
the
editor
of
the
asking
whether
it
was
necessary
for
a
person
to
profess
atheism
before
being
admitted
to
the
society
the
answer
appeared
in
the
to
be
a
member
of
the
national
secular
society
it
is
only
necessary
to
be
able
honestly
to
accept
the
four
principles
as
given
in
the
of
june
this
any
person
may
do
without
being
required
to
avow
himself
an
atheist
candidly
we
can
see
no
logical
between
the
entire
acceptance
of
authority
as
in
the
roman
catholic
church
and
the
most
extreme
rationalism
if
on
again
looking
to
the
principles
of
the
society
you
can
accept
them
we
repeat
to
you
our
invitation
i
sent
my
name
in
as
an
active
member
and
find
it
is
recorded
in
the
of
august
having
received
an
intimation
that
londoners
could
receive
their
certificates
at
the
hall
of
science
from
bradlaugh
on
any
sunday
evening
i
betook
myself
thither
and
it
was
on
august
that
i
first
set
foot
in
a
freethought
hall
the
hall
was
crowded
to
suffocation
and
at
the
very
moment
announced
for
the
lecture
a
roar
of
cheering
burst
forth
a
tall
figure
passed
swiftly
up
the
hall
to
the
platform
and
with
a
slight
bow
in
answer
to
the
voluminous
greeting
charles
bradlaugh
took
his
seat
i
looked
at
him
with
interest
impressed
and
surprised
the
grave
quiet
stern
strong
face
the
massive
head
the
keen
eyes
the
magnificent
breadth
and
height
of
forehead
was
this
the
man
i
had
heard
described
as
a
blatant
agitator
an
ignorant
demagogue
he
began
quietly
and
simply
tracing
out
the
resemblances
between
the
krishna
and
the
christ
myths
and
as
he
went
from
point
to
point
his
voice
grew
in
force
and
resonance
till
it
rang
round
the
hall
like
a
trumpet
familiar
with
the
subject
i
could
test
the
value
of
his
treatment
of
it
and
saw
that
his
knowledge
was
as
sound
as
his
language
was
splendid
eloquence
fire
sarcasm
pathos
passion
all
in
turn
were
bent
against
christian
superstition
till
the
great
audience
carried
away
by
the
torrent
of
the
orator
force
hung
silent
breathing
soft
as
he
went
on
till
the
silence
that
followed
a
magnificent
peroration
broke
the
spell
and
a
hurricane
of
cheers
relieved
the
tension
he
came
down
the
hall
with
some
certificates
in
his
hand
glanced
round
and
handed
me
mine
with
a
questioning
mrs
besant
then
he
said
referring
to
my
question
as
to
a
profession
of
atheism
that
he
would
willingly
talk
over
the
subject
of
atheism
with
me
if
i
would
make
an
appointment
and
offered
me
a
book
he
had
been
using
in
his
lecture
long
afterwards
i
asked
him
how
he
knew
me
whom
he
had
never
seen
that
he
came
straight
to
me
in
such
fashion
he
laughed
and
said
he
did
not
know
but
glancing
over
the
faces
he
felt
sure
that
i
was
annie
besant
from
that
first
meeting
in
the
hall
of
science
dated
a
friendship
that
lasted
unbroken
till
death
severed
the
earthly
bond
and
that
to
me
stretches
through
death
gateway
and
links
us
together
still
as
friends
not
as
strangers
we
met
swift
recognition
as
it
were
leaping
from
eye
to
eye
and
i
know
now
that
the
instinctive
friendliness
was
in
very
truth
an
outgrowth
of
strong
friendship
in
other
lives
and
that
on
that
august
day
we
took
up
again
an
ancient
tie
we
did
not
begin
a
new
one
and
so
in
lives
to
come
we
shall
meet
again
and
help
each
other
as
we
helped
each
other
in
this
and
let
me
here
place
on
record
as
i
have
done
before
some
word
of
what
i
owe
him
for
his
true
friendship
though
indeed
how
great
is
my
debt
to
him
i
can
never
tell
some
of
his
wise
phrases
have
ever
remained
in
my
memory
you
should
never
say
you
have
an
opinion
on
a
subject
until
you
have
tried
to
study
the
strongest
things
said
against
the
view
to
which
you
are
inclined
you
must
not
think
you
know
a
subject
until
you
are
acquainted
with
all
that
the
best
minds
have
said
about
it
no
steady
work
can
be
done
in
public
unless
the
worker
study
at
home
far
more
than
he
talks
outside
be
your
own
harshest
judge
listen
to
your
own
speech
and
criticise
it
read
abuse
of
yourself
and
see
what
grains
of
truth
are
in
it
do
not
waste
time
by
reading
opinions
that
are
mere
echoes
of
your
own
read
opinions
you
disagree
with
and
you
will
catch
aspects
of
truth
you
do
not
readily
see
through
our
long
comradeship
he
was
my
sternest
as
well
as
gentlest
critic
pointing
out
to
me
that
in
a
party
like
ours
where
our
own
education
and
knowledge
were
above
those
whom
we
led
it
was
very
easy
to
gain
indiscriminate
praise
and
unstinted
admiration
on
the
other
hand
we
received
from
christians
equally
indiscriminate
abuse
and
hatred
it
was
therefore
needful
that
we
should
be
our
own
harshest
judges
and
that
we
should
be
sure
that
we
knew
thoroughly
every
subject
that
we
taught
he
saved
me
from
the
superficiality
that
my
fatal
facility
of
speech
might
so
easily
have
induced
and
when
i
began
to
taste
the
intoxication
of
easily
won
applause
his
criticism
of
weak
points
his
challenge
of
weak
arguments
his
trained
judgment
were
of
priceless
service
to
me
and
what
of
value
there
is
in
my
work
is
very
largely
due
to
his
influence
which
at
once
stimulated
and
restrained
one
very
charming
characteristic
of
his
was
his
extreme
courtesy
in
private
life
especially
to
women
this
outward
polish
which
sat
so
gracefully
on
his
massive
frame
and
stately
presence
was
foreign
rather
than
english
for
the
english
as
a
rule
save
such
as
go
to
court
are
a
singularly
unpolished
people
and
it
gave
his
manner
a
peculiar
charm
i
asked
him
once
where
he
had
learned
his
gracious
fashions
that
were
so
he
would
stand
with
uplifted
hat
as
he
asked
a
question
of
a
maidservant
or
handed
a
woman
into
a
carriage
and
he
answered
with
a
that
it
was
only
in
england
he
was
an
outcast
from
society
in
france
in
spain
in
italy
he
was
always
welcomed
among
men
and
women
of
the
highest
social
rank
and
he
supposed
that
he
had
unconsciously
caught
the
foreign
tricks
of
manner
moreover
he
was
absolutely
indifferent
to
all
questions
of
social
position
peer
or
artisan
it
was
to
him
exactly
the
same
he
never
seemed
conscious
of
the
distinctions
of
which
men
make
so
much
our
first
conversation
after
the
meeting
at
the
hall
of
science
took
place
a
day
or
two
later
in
his
little
study
in
turner
street
commercial
road
a
wee
room
overflowing
with
books
in
which
he
looked
singularly
out
of
place
later
i
learned
that
he
had
failed
in
business
in
consequence
of
christian
persecution
and
resolute
to
avoid
bankruptcy
he
had
sold
everything
he
possessed
save
his
books
had
sent
his
wife
and
daughters
to
live
in
the
country
with
his
had
taken
two
tiny
rooms
in
turner
street
where
he
could
live
for
a
mere
trifle
and
had
bent
himself
to
the
task
of
paying
off
the
liabilities
he
had
incurred
incurred
in
consequence
of
his
battling
for
political
and
religious
liberty
i
took
with
me
my
essay
on
the
nature
and
existence
of
god
and
it
served
as
the
basis
for
our
conversation
we
found
there
was
little
difference
in
our
views
you
have
thought
yourself
into
atheism
without
knowing
it
he
said
and
all
that
i
changed
in
the
essay
was
the
correction
of
the
vulgar
error
that
the
atheist
says
there
is
no
god
by
the
insertion
of
a
passage
disclaiming
this
position
from
an
essay
pointed
out
to
me
by
bradlaugh
and
at
this
stage
of
my
it
is
necessary
to
put
very
clearly
the
position
i
took
up
and
held
so
many
years
as
atheist
because
otherwise
the
further
evolution
into
theosophist
will
be
wholly
incomprehensible
it
will
lead
me
into
metaphysics
and
to
some
readers
these
are
dry
but
if
any
one
would
understand
the
evolution
of
a
soul
he
must
be
willing
to
face
the
questions
which
the
soul
faces
in
its
growth
and
the
position
of
the
philosophic
atheist
is
so
misunderstood
that
it
is
the
more
necessary
to
put
it
plainly
and
theosophists
at
least
in
reading
it
will
see
how
theosophy
stepped
in
finally
as
a
further
evolution
towards
knowledge
rendering
rational
and
therefore
acceptable
the
loftiest
spirituality
that
the
human
mind
can
as
yet
conceive
in
order
that
i
may
not
colour
my
past
thinkings
by
my
present
thought
i
take
my
statements
from
pamphlets
written
when
i
adopted
the
atheistic
philosophy
and
while
i
continued
an
adherent
thereof
no
charge
can
then
be
made
that
i
have
softened
my
old
opinions
for
the
sake
of
reconciling
them
with
those
now
held
chapter
vii
atheism
as
i
knew
and
taught
it
the
first
step
which
leaves
behind
the
idea
of
a
limited
and
personal
god
an
creator
and
leads
the
student
to
the
point
whence
atheism
and
pantheism
diverge
is
the
recognition
that
a
profound
unity
of
substance
underlies
the
infinite
diversities
of
natural
phenomena
the
discernment
of
the
one
beneath
the
many
this
was
the
step
i
had
taken
ere
my
first
meeting
with
charles
bradlaugh
and
i
had
written
it
is
manifest
to
all
who
will
take
the
trouble
to
think
steadily
that
there
can
be
only
one
eternal
and
underived
substance
and
that
matter
and
spirit
must
therefore
only
be
varying
manifestations
of
this
one
substance
the
distinction
made
between
matter
and
spirit
is
then
simply
made
for
the
sake
of
convenience
and
clearness
just
as
we
may
distinguish
perception
from
judgment
both
of
which
however
are
alike
processes
of
thought
matter
is
in
its
constituent
elements
the
same
as
spirit
existence
is
however
manifold
in
its
phenomena
life
is
one
however
multiform
in
its
evolution
as
the
heat
of
the
coal
differs
from
the
coal
itself
so
do
memory
perception
judgment
emotion
and
will
differ
from
the
brain
which
is
the
instrument
of
thought
but
nevertheless
they
are
all
equally
products
of
the
one
sole
substance
varying
only
in
their
conditions
i
find
myself
then
compelled
to
believe
that
one
only
substance
exists
in
all
around
me
that
the
universe
is
eternal
or
at
least
eternal
so
far
as
our
faculties
are
concerned
since
we
can
not
as
some
one
has
quaintly
put
it
to
the
outside
of
everywhere
that
a
deity
can
not
be
conceived
of
as
apart
from
the
universe
that
the
worker
and
the
work
are
inextricably
interwoven
and
in
some
sense
eternally
and
indissolubly
combined
having
got
so
far
we
will
proceed
to
examine
into
the
possibility
of
proving
the
existence
of
that
one
essence
popularly
called
by
the
name
of
under
the
conditions
strictly
defined
by
the
orthodox
having
demonstrated
as
i
hope
to
do
that
the
orthodox
idea
of
god
is
unreasonable
and
absurd
we
will
endeavour
to
ascertain
whether
idea
of
god
worthy
to
be
called
an
idea
is
attainable
in
the
present
state
of
our
faculties
the
deity
must
of
necessity
be
that
one
and
only
substance
out
of
which
all
things
are
evolved
under
the
uncreated
conditions
and
eternal
laws
of
the
universe
he
must
be
as
theodore
parker
somewhat
oddly
puts
it
materiality
of
matter
as
well
as
the
spirituality
of
spirit
these
must
both
be
products
of
this
one
substance
a
truth
which
is
readily
accepted
as
soon
as
spirit
and
matter
are
seen
to
be
but
different
modes
of
one
essence
thus
we
identify
substance
with
the
and
vivifying
force
of
nature
and
in
so
doing
we
simply
reduce
to
a
physical
impossibility
the
existence
of
the
being
described
by
the
orthodox
as
a
god
possessing
the
attributes
of
personality
the
deity
becomes
identified
with
nature
with
the
universe
but
the
of
the
orthodox
no
longer
exists
we
may
change
the
signification
of
god
and
use
the
word
to
express
a
different
idea
but
we
can
no
longer
mean
by
it
a
personal
being
in
the
orthodox
sense
possessing
an
individuality
which
divides
him
from
the
rest
of
the
universe
proceeding
to
search
whether
idea
of
god
was
attainable
i
came
to
the
conclusion
that
evidence
of
the
existence
of
a
conscious
power
was
lacking
and
that
the
ordinary
proofs
offered
were
inconclusive
that
we
could
grasp
phenomena
and
no
more
there
appears
also
to
be
a
possibility
of
a
mind
in
nature
though
we
have
seen
that
intelligence
is
strictly
speaking
impossible
there
can
not
be
perception
memory
comparison
or
judgment
but
may
there
not
be
a
perfect
mind
unchanging
calm
and
still
our
faculties
fail
us
when
we
try
to
estimate
the
deity
and
we
are
betrayed
into
contradictions
and
absurdities
but
does
it
therefore
follow
that
he
not
it
seems
to
me
that
to
deny
his
existence
is
to
overstep
the
boundaries
of
our
almost
as
much
as
to
try
and
define
it
we
pretend
to
know
the
unknown
if
we
declare
him
to
be
the
unknowable
unknowable
to
us
at
present
yes
unknowable
for
ever
in
other
possible
stages
of
existence
we
have
reached
a
region
into
which
we
can
not
penetrate
here
all
human
faculties
fail
us
we
bow
our
heads
on
threshold
of
the
unknown
the
ear
of
man
can
not
hear
and
the
eye
of
man
can
not
see
but
if
we
could
see
and
hear
this
vision
were
it
not
he
thus
sings
alfred
tennyson
the
poet
of
metaphysics
we
could
see
and
hear
alas
it
is
always
an
this
refusal
to
believe
without
evidence
and
the
declaration
that
anything
behind
phenomena
is
unknowable
to
man
as
at
present
constituted
these
are
the
two
chief
planks
of
the
atheistic
platform
as
atheism
was
held
by
charles
bradlaugh
and
myself
in
this
position
was
clearly
reaffirmed
it
is
necessary
to
put
briefly
the
atheistic
position
for
no
position
is
more
continuously
and
more
persistently
misrepresented
atheism
is
god
it
does
not
assert
god
atheist
does
not
say
there
is
no
god
but
he
says
i
know
not
what
you
mean
by
god
i
am
without
idea
of
god
the
word
god
is
to
me
a
sound
conveying
no
clear
or
distinct
affirmation
i
do
not
deny
god
because
i
can
not
deny
that
of
which
i
have
no
conception
and
the
conception
of
which
by
its
affirmer
is
so
imperfect
that
he
is
unable
to
define
it
to
me
charles
bradlaugh
freethinker
p
the
atheist
neither
affirms
nor
denies
the
possibility
of
phenomena
differing
from
those
recognised
by
human
experience
as
his
knowledge
of
the
universe
is
extremely
limited
and
very
imperfect
the
atheist
declines
either
to
deny
or
to
affirm
anything
with
regard
to
modes
of
existence
of
which
he
knows
nothing
further
he
refuses
to
believe
anything
concerning
that
of
which
he
knows
nothing
and
affirms
that
that
which
can
never
be
the
subject
of
knowledge
ought
never
to
be
the
object
of
belief
while
the
atheist
then
neither
affirms
nor
denies
the
unknown
he
deny
all
which
conflicts
with
the
knowledge
to
which
he
has
already
attained
for
example
he
that
one
is
one
and
that
three
times
one
are
three
he
that
three
times
one
are
or
can
be
one
the
position
of
the
atheist
is
a
clear
and
a
reasonable
one
i
know
nothing
about
and
therefore
i
do
not
believe
in
him
or
in
it
what
you
tell
me
about
your
god
is
and
is
therefore
incredible
i
do
not
deny
which
is
an
unknown
tongue
to
me
i
do
deny
your
god
who
is
an
impossibility
i
am
without
god
up
to
i
find
myself
writing
on
the
same
lines
no
man
can
rationally
affirm
is
no
god
until
the
word
has
for
him
a
definite
meaning
and
until
everything
that
exists
is
known
to
him
and
known
with
what
leibnitz
calls
knowledge
the
atheist
denial
of
the
gods
begins
only
when
these
gods
are
defined
or
described
never
yet
has
a
god
been
defined
in
terms
which
were
not
palpably
and
absurd
never
yet
has
a
god
been
described
so
that
a
concept
of
him
was
made
possible
to
human
thought
nor
is
anything
gained
by
the
assertors
of
deity
when
they
allege
that
he
is
incomprehensible
if
exists
and
is
incomprehensible
his
incomprehensibility
is
an
admirable
reason
for
being
silent
about
him
but
can
never
justify
the
affirmation
of
propositions
and
the
threatening
of
people
with
damnation
if
they
do
not
accept
them
the
belief
of
the
atheist
stops
where
his
evidence
stops
he
believes
in
the
existence
of
the
universe
judging
the
accessible
proof
thereof
to
be
adequate
and
he
finds
in
this
universe
sufficient
cause
for
the
happening
of
all
phenomena
he
finds
no
intellectual
satisfaction
in
placing
a
gigantic
conundrum
behind
the
universe
which
only
adds
its
own
unintelligibility
to
the
already
sufficiently
difficult
problem
of
existence
our
lungs
are
not
fitted
to
breathe
beyond
the
atmosphere
which
surrounds
our
globe
and
our
faculties
can
not
breathe
outside
the
atmosphere
of
the
phenomenal
and
i
summed
up
this
essay
with
the
words
i
do
not
believe
in
god
my
mind
finds
no
grounds
on
which
to
build
up
a
reasonable
faith
my
heart
revolts
against
the
spectre
of
an
almighty
indifference
to
the
pain
of
sentient
beings
my
conscience
rebels
against
the
injustice
the
cruelty
the
inequality
which
surround
me
on
every
side
but
i
believe
in
man
in
redeeming
power
in
man
remoulding
energy
in
man
approaching
triumph
through
knowledge
love
and
work
these
views
of
existence
naturally
colour
all
views
of
life
and
of
the
existence
of
the
soul
and
here
steps
in
the
profound
difference
between
atheism
and
pantheism
both
posit
an
existence
at
present
inscrutable
by
human
faculties
of
which
all
phenomena
are
modes
but
to
the
atheist
that
existence
manifests
as
unconscious
unintelligent
while
to
the
pantheist
it
manifests
as
conscious
intelligent
to
the
one
life
and
consciousness
are
attributes
properties
dependent
upon
arrangements
of
matter
to
the
other
they
are
fundamental
essential
and
only
limited
in
their
manifestation
by
arrangements
of
matter
despite
the
attraction
held
for
me
in
spinoza
luminous
arguments
the
sway
which
science
was
beginning
to
exercise
over
me
drove
me
to
seek
for
the
explanation
of
all
problems
of
life
and
mind
at
the
hands
of
the
biologist
and
the
chemist
they
had
done
so
much
explained
so
much
could
they
not
explain
all
surely
i
thought
the
one
safe
ground
is
that
of
experiment
and
the
remembered
agony
of
doubt
made
me
very
slow
to
believe
where
i
could
not
prove
so
i
was
fain
to
regard
life
as
an
attribute
and
this
again
strengthened
the
atheistic
position
scientifically
regarded
life
is
not
an
entity
but
a
property
it
is
not
a
mode
of
existence
but
a
characteristic
of
certain
modes
life
is
the
result
of
an
arrangement
of
matter
and
when
rearrangement
occurs
the
former
result
can
no
longer
be
present
we
call
the
result
of
the
changed
arrangement
death
life
and
death
are
two
convenient
words
for
expressing
the
general
outcome
of
two
arrangements
of
matter
one
of
which
is
always
found
to
precede
the
other
and
then
having
resorted
to
chemistry
for
one
illustration
i
took
another
from
one
of
those
striking
and
easily
grasped
analogies
facility
for
seeing
and
presenting
which
has
ever
been
one
of
the
secrets
of
my
success
as
a
propagandist
like
pictures
they
impress
the
mind
of
the
hearer
with
a
vivid
sense
of
reality
every
one
knows
the
exquisite
iridiscence
of
the
tender
delicate
hues
which
melt
into
each
other
glowing
with
soft
radiance
how
different
is
the
dull
dead
surface
of
a
piece
of
wax
yet
take
that
dull
black
wax
and
mould
it
so
closely
to
the
surface
of
the
that
it
shall
take
every
delicate
marking
of
the
shell
and
when
you
raise
it
the
glory
shall
smile
at
you
from
the
erstwhile
colourless
surface
for
though
it
be
to
the
naked
eye
imperceptible
all
the
surface
of
the
is
in
delicate
ridges
and
furrows
like
the
surface
of
a
field
and
when
the
waves
of
light
come
dashing
up
against
the
ridged
surface
they
are
broken
like
the
waves
on
a
shingly
shore
and
are
flung
backwards
so
that
they
cross
each
other
and
the
oncoming
waves
and
as
every
ray
of
white
light
is
made
up
of
waves
of
seven
colours
and
these
waves
differ
in
length
each
from
the
others
the
fairy
ridges
fling
them
backward
separately
and
each
ray
reaches
the
eye
by
itself
so
that
the
colour
of
the
is
really
the
spray
of
the
light
waves
and
comes
from
arrangement
of
matter
once
again
give
the
dull
black
wax
the
same
ridges
and
furrows
and
its
glory
shall
differ
in
nothing
from
that
of
the
shell
to
apply
our
illustration
as
the
colour
belongs
to
one
arrangement
of
matter
and
the
dead
surface
to
another
so
life
belongs
to
some
arrangements
of
matter
and
is
their
resultant
while
the
resultant
of
other
arrangements
is
death
the
same
line
of
reasoning
naturally
was
applied
to
the
existence
of
spirit
in
man
and
it
was
argued
that
mental
activity
the
domain
of
the
spirit
was
dependent
on
bodily
organisation
when
the
babe
is
born
it
shows
no
sign
of
mind
for
a
brief
space
hunger
and
repletion
cold
and
warmth
are
its
only
sensations
slowly
the
specialised
senses
begin
to
function
still
more
slowly
muscular
movements
at
first
aimless
and
reflex
become
and
consciously
directed
there
is
no
sign
here
of
an
intelligent
spirit
controlling
a
mechanism
there
is
every
sign
of
a
learning
and
developing
intelligence
developing
with
the
organism
of
which
it
is
a
function
as
the
body
grows
the
mind
grows
with
it
and
the
childish
mind
of
the
child
develops
into
the
hasty
unbalanced
youthful
mind
of
the
youth
with
maturity
of
years
comes
maturity
of
mind
and
body
and
mind
are
vigorous
and
in
their
prime
as
old
age
comes
on
and
the
bodily
functions
decay
the
mind
decays
also
until
age
passes
into
senility
and
body
and
mind
sink
into
second
childhood
has
the
immortal
spirit
decayed
with
the
organisation
or
is
it
dwelling
in
sorrow
bound
in
its
of
clay
if
this
be
so
the
must
be
unconscious
or
else
separate
from
the
very
individual
whose
essence
it
is
supposed
to
be
for
the
old
man
does
not
suffer
when
his
mind
is
senile
but
is
contented
as
a
little
child
and
not
only
is
this
constant
simultaneous
growth
and
decay
of
body
and
mind
to
be
observed
but
we
know
that
mental
functions
are
disordered
and
suspended
by
various
physical
conditions
alcohol
many
drugs
fever
disorder
the
mind
a
blow
on
the
cranium
suspends
its
functions
and
the
returns
with
the
surgeon
trepanning
does
the
take
part
in
dreams
is
it
absent
from
the
idiot
from
the
lunatic
is
it
guilty
of
manslaughter
when
the
madman
murders
or
does
it
helplessly
watch
its
own
instrument
performing
actions
at
which
it
shudders
if
it
can
only
work
here
through
an
organism
is
its
nature
changed
in
its
independent
life
severed
from
all
with
which
it
was
identified
can
it
in
its
state
have
anything
in
common
with
its
past
it
will
be
seen
that
my
unbelief
in
the
existence
of
the
soul
or
spirit
was
a
matter
of
cold
calm
reasoning
as
i
wrote
in
for
many
of
us
evidence
must
precede
belief
i
would
gladly
believe
in
a
happy
immortality
for
all
as
i
would
gladly
believe
that
all
misery
and
crime
and
poverty
will
disappear
in
i
but
i
am
unable
to
believe
an
improbable
proposition
unless
convincing
evidence
is
brought
in
support
of
it
immortality
is
most
improbable
no
evidence
is
brought
forward
in
its
favour
i
can
not
believe
only
because
i
wish
such
was
the
philosophy
by
which
i
lived
from
to
when
first
some
researches
that
will
be
dealt
with
in
their
proper
place
and
which
led
me
ultimately
to
the
evidence
i
had
before
vainly
demanded
began
to
shake
my
confidence
in
its
adequacy
amid
outer
storm
and
turmoil
and
conflict
i
found
it
satisfy
my
intellect
while
lofty
ideals
of
morality
fed
my
emotions
i
called
myself
atheist
and
rightly
so
for
i
was
without
god
and
my
horizon
was
bounded
by
life
on
earth
i
gloried
in
the
name
then
as
it
is
dear
to
my
heart
now
for
all
the
associations
with
which
it
is
connected
atheist
is
one
of
the
grandest
titles
a
man
can
wear
it
is
the
order
of
merit
of
the
world
heroes
most
great
discoverers
most
philosophers
most
earnest
reformers
most
toiling
pioneers
of
progress
have
in
their
turn
had
flung
at
them
the
name
of
atheist
it
was
howled
over
the
grave
of
copernicus
it
was
clamoured
round
the
of
bruno
it
was
yelled
at
vanini
at
spinoza
at
priestley
at
voltaire
at
paine
it
has
become
the
of
the
hero
the
halo
of
the
martyr
in
the
world
history
it
has
meant
the
pioneer
of
progress
and
where
the
cry
of
is
raised
there
may
we
be
sure
that
another
step
is
being
taken
towards
the
redemption
of
humanity
the
saviours
of
the
world
are
too
often
howled
at
as
atheists
and
then
worshipped
as
deities
the
atheists
are
the
vanguard
of
the
army
of
freethought
on
whom
falls
the
brunt
of
the
battle
and
are
shivered
the
hardest
of
the
blows
their
feet
trample
down
the
thorns
that
others
may
tread
unwounded
their
bodies
fill
up
the
ditch
that
by
the
bridge
thus
made
others
may
pass
to
victory
honour
to
the
pioneers
of
progress
honour
to
the
vanguard
of
liberty
army
honour
to
those
who
to
improve
earth
have
forgotten
heaven
and
who
in
their
zeal
for
man
have
forgotten
god
this
poor
sketch
of
the
conception
of
the
universe
to
which
i
had
conquered
my
way
at
the
cost
of
so
much
pain
and
which
was
the
inner
centre
round
which
my
life
revolved
for
twelve
years
may
perhaps
show
that
the
atheistic
philosophy
is
misjudged
sorely
when
it
is
scouted
as
vile
or
condemned
as
intellectually
degraded
it
has
outgrown
anthropomorphic
deities
and
it
leaves
us
face
to
face
with
nature
open
to
all
her
purifying
strengthening
inspirations
there
is
only
one
kind
of
prayer
it
says
which
is
reasonable
and
that
is
the
deep
silent
adoration
of
the
greatness
and
beauty
and
order
around
us
as
revealed
in
the
realms
of
life
and
in
humanity
as
we
bow
our
heads
before
the
laws
of
the
universe
and
mould
our
lives
into
obedience
to
their
voice
we
find
a
strong
calm
peace
steal
over
our
hearts
a
perfect
trust
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
the
right
a
quiet
determination
to
our
lives
sublime
before
our
own
high
ideals
before
those
lives
which
show
us
high
the
tides
of
divine
life
have
risen
in
the
human
world
we
stand
with
hushed
voice
and
veiled
face
from
them
we
draw
strength
to
emulate
and
even
dare
struggle
to
excel
the
contemplation
of
the
ideal
is
true
prayer
it
inspires
it
strengthens
it
ennobles
the
other
part
of
prayer
is
work
from
contemplation
to
labour
from
the
forest
to
the
street
study
nature
laws
conform
to
them
work
in
harmony
with
them
and
work
becomes
a
prayer
and
a
thanksgiving
an
adoration
of
the
universal
wisdom
and
a
true
obedience
to
the
universal
law
to
a
woman
of
my
temperament
filled
with
passionate
desire
for
the
bettering
of
the
world
the
elevation
of
humanity
a
lofty
system
of
ethics
was
of
even
more
importance
than
a
logical
intellectual
conception
of
the
universe
and
the
total
loss
of
all
faith
in
a
righteous
god
only
made
me
more
strenuously
assertive
of
the
binding
nature
of
duty
and
the
overwhelming
importance
of
conduct
in
this
conviction
found
voice
in
a
pamphlet
on
the
true
basis
of
morality
and
in
all
the
years
of
my
propaganda
on
the
platform
of
the
national
secular
society
no
subject
was
more
frequently
dealt
with
in
my
lectures
than
that
of
human
ethical
growth
and
the
duty
of
man
to
man
no
thought
was
more
constantly
in
my
mind
than
that
of
the
importance
of
morals
and
it
was
voiced
at
the
very
outset
of
my
public
career
speaking
of
the
danger
lest
in
these
stirring
times
of
inquiry
old
sanctions
of
right
conduct
should
be
cast
aside
ere
new
ones
were
firmly
established
i
wrote
it
therefore
becomes
the
duty
of
every
one
who
fights
in
the
ranks
of
freethought
and
who
ventures
to
attack
the
dogmas
of
the
churches
and
to
strike
down
the
superstitions
which
enslave
men
intellect
to
beware
how
he
uproots
sanctions
of
morality
which
he
is
too
weak
to
replace
or
how
before
he
is
prepared
with
better
ones
he
removes
the
barriers
which
do
yet
however
poorly
to
some
extent
check
vice
and
repress
crime
that
which
touches
morality
touches
the
heart
of
society
a
high
and
pure
morality
is
the
of
humanity
mistakes
in
belief
are
inevitable
and
are
of
little
moment
mistakes
in
life
destroy
happiness
and
their
destructive
consequences
spread
far
and
wide
it
is
then
a
very
important
question
whether
we
who
are
endeavouring
to
take
away
from
the
world
the
authority
on
which
has
hitherto
been
based
all
its
morality
can
offer
a
new
and
firm
ground
whereupon
may
safely
be
built
up
the
fair
edifice
of
a
noble
life
i
then
proceeded
to
analyse
revelation
and
intuition
as
a
basis
for
morals
and
discarding
both
i
asserted
the
true
basis
of
morality
is
utility
that
is
the
adaptation
of
our
actions
to
the
promotion
of
the
general
welfare
and
happiness
the
endeavour
so
to
rule
our
lives
that
we
may
serve
and
bless
mankind
and
i
argued
for
this
basis
showing
that
the
effort
after
virtue
was
implied
in
the
search
for
happiness
virtue
is
an
indispensable
part
of
all
true
and
solid
happiness
but
it
is
after
all
only
reasonable
that
happiness
should
be
the
ultimate
test
of
right
and
wrong
if
we
live
as
we
do
in
a
realm
of
law
obedience
to
law
must
necessarily
result
in
harmony
and
disobedience
in
discord
but
if
obedience
to
law
result
in
harmony
it
must
also
result
in
happiness
all
through
nature
obedience
to
law
results
in
happiness
and
through
obedience
each
living
thing
fulfils
the
perfection
of
its
being
and
in
that
perfection
finds
its
true
happiness
it
seemed
to
me
most
important
to
remove
morality
from
the
controversies
about
religion
and
to
give
it
a
basis
of
its
own
as
then
the
grave
subject
of
the
existence
of
deity
is
a
matter
of
dispute
it
is
evidently
of
deep
importance
to
society
that
morality
should
not
be
dragged
into
this
battlefield
to
stand
or
totter
with
the
various
theories
of
the
divine
nature
which
human
thought
creates
and
destroys
if
we
can
found
morality
on
a
basis
apart
from
theology
we
shall
do
humanity
a
service
which
can
scarcely
be
overestimated
a
study
of
the
facts
of
nature
of
the
consequences
of
man
in
society
seemed
sufficient
for
such
a
basis
our
faculties
do
not
suffice
to
tell
us
about
god
they
do
suffice
to
study
phenomena
and
to
deduce
laws
from
correlated
facts
surely
then
we
should
do
wisely
to
concentrate
our
strength
and
our
energies
on
the
discovery
of
the
attainable
instead
of
on
the
search
after
the
unknowable
if
we
are
told
that
morality
consists
in
obedience
to
the
supposed
will
of
a
supposed
perfectly
moral
being
because
in
so
doing
we
please
god
then
we
are
at
once
placed
in
a
region
where
our
faculties
are
useless
to
us
and
where
our
judgment
is
at
fault
but
if
we
are
told
that
we
are
to
lead
noble
lives
because
nobility
of
life
is
desirable
for
itself
alone
because
in
so
doing
we
are
acting
in
harmony
with
the
laws
of
nature
because
in
so
doing
we
spread
happiness
around
our
pathway
and
gladden
our
then
indeed
motives
are
appealed
to
which
spring
forward
to
meet
the
call
and
chords
are
struck
in
our
hearts
which
respond
in
music
to
the
touch
it
was
to
the
establishment
of
this
secure
basis
that
i
bent
my
energies
this
that
was
to
me
of
supreme
moment
amid
the
fervid
movement
of
society
with
its
wild
theories
and
crude
social
reforms
with
its
righteous
fury
against
oppression
and
its
unconsidered
notions
of
wider
freedom
and
gladder
life
it
is
of
vital
importance
that
morality
should
stand
on
a
foundation
unshakable
that
so
through
all
political
and
religious
revolutions
human
life
may
grow
purer
and
nobler
may
rise
upwards
into
settled
freedom
and
not
sink
downwards
into
anarchy
only
utility
can
afford
us
a
sure
basis
the
reasonableness
of
which
will
be
accepted
alike
by
thoughtful
student
and
artisan
utility
appeals
to
all
alike
and
sets
in
action
motives
which
are
found
equally
in
every
human
heart
well
shall
it
be
for
humanity
that
creeds
and
dogmas
pass
away
that
superstition
vanishes
and
the
clear
light
of
freedom
and
science
dawns
on
a
regenerated
earth
but
well
only
if
men
draw
tighter
and
closer
the
links
of
trustworthiness
of
honour
and
of
truth
equality
before
the
law
is
necessary
and
just
liberty
is
the
birthright
of
every
man
and
woman
free
individual
development
will
elevate
and
glorify
the
race
but
little
worth
these
priceless
jewels
little
worth
liberty
and
equality
with
all
their
promise
for
mankind
little
worth
even
wider
happiness
if
that
happiness
be
selfish
if
true
fraternity
true
brotherhood
do
not
knit
man
to
man
and
heart
to
heart
in
loyal
service
to
the
common
need
and
generous
to
the
common
good
to
the
forwarding
of
this
moral
growth
of
man
two
things
seemed
to
me
necessary
an
ideal
which
should
stir
the
emotions
and
impel
to
action
and
a
clear
understanding
of
the
sources
of
evil
and
of
the
methods
by
which
they
might
be
drained
into
the
drawing
of
the
first
i
threw
all
the
passion
of
my
nature
striving
to
paint
the
ideal
in
colours
which
should
enthral
and
fascinate
so
that
love
and
desire
to
realise
might
stir
man
to
effort
if
morality
touched
by
emotion
be
religion
then
truly
was
i
the
most
religious
of
atheists
finding
in
this
dwelling
on
and
glorifying
of
the
ideal
full
satisfaction
for
the
loftiest
emotions
to
meet
the
fascination
exercised
over
men
hearts
by
the
man
of
sorrows
i
raised
the
image
of
man
triumphant
man
perfected
rightly
is
the
ideal
christian
type
of
humanity
a
man
of
sorrows
jesus
with
worn
and
wasted
body
with
sad
thin
lips
curved
into
a
mournful
droop
of
penitence
for
human
sin
with
weary
eyes
gazing
up
to
heaven
because
despairing
of
earth
bowed
down
and
aged
with
grief
and
pain
with
long
anguish
with
unresisted
such
is
the
ideal
man
of
the
christian
creed
beautiful
with
a
certain
pathetic
beauty
telling
of
the
long
travail
of
earth
eloquent
of
the
sufferings
of
humanity
but
not
the
model
type
to
which
men
should
conform
their
lives
if
they
would
make
humanity
glorious
and
therefore
in
radiant
contrast
with
this
stands
out
in
the
sunshine
and
under
the
blue
summer
sky
far
from
graveyards
and
torture
of
death
agony
the
fair
ideal
humanity
of
the
atheist
in
form
strong
and
fair
perfect
in
physical
development
as
the
hercules
of
grecian
art
radiant
with
love
glorious
in
power
with
lips
bent
firm
to
resist
oppression
and
melting
into
soft
curves
of
passion
and
of
pity
with
deep
eyes
gazing
piercingly
into
the
secrets
of
the
unknown
and
resting
lovingly
on
the
beauties
around
him
with
hands
strong
to
work
in
the
present
with
heart
full
of
hope
which
the
future
shall
realise
making
earth
glad
with
his
labour
and
beautiful
with
his
skill
this
this
is
the
ideal
man
enshrined
in
the
atheist
heart
the
ideal
humanity
of
the
christian
is
the
humanity
of
the
slave
poor
meek
humble
submissive
to
authority
however
oppressive
and
unjust
the
ideal
humanity
of
the
atheist
is
the
humanity
of
the
free
man
who
knows
no
lord
who
brooks
no
tyranny
who
relies
on
his
own
strength
who
makes
his
brother
quarrel
his
proud
loyal
brave
a
view
yes
but
a
very
natural
outcome
of
a
sunny
nature
for
years
held
down
by
unhappiness
and
the
harshness
of
an
outgrown
creed
it
was
the
rebound
of
such
a
nature
suddenly
set
free
rejoicing
in
its
liberty
and
strength
and
it
carried
with
it
a
great
power
of
rousing
the
sympathetic
enthusiasm
of
men
and
women
deeply
conscious
of
their
own
restrictions
and
their
own
longings
it
was
the
cry
of
the
freed
soul
that
had
found
articulate
expression
and
the
many
inarticulate
and
prisoned
souls
answered
to
it
tumultously
with
fluttering
of
caged
wings
with
hot
insistence
i
battled
for
the
inspiration
to
be
drawn
from
the
beauty
and
grandeur
of
which
human
life
was
capable
will
any
one
exclaim
are
taking
all
beauty
out
of
human
life
all
hope
all
warmth
all
inspiration
you
give
us
cold
duty
for
filial
obedience
and
inexorable
law
in
the
place
of

all
beauty
from
life
is
there
then
no
beauty
in
the
idea
of
forming
part
of
the
great
life
of
the
universe
no
beauty
in
conscious
harmony
with

no
beauty
in

no
beauty

why
i

i
give
you

if
i
bid
you

with
the
knowledge
that
this

will

to

london
or

you
are

as
you
gaze
at
the
wounds
of
jesus
dead
in

long

and
find
no

dying

his

your

but
you
see
no
pathos
in
the

obedience
what

you

obedience

true
our
creed
a
stern
one
stern
with
the
beautiful
sternness
of
nature
but
if
we
be
in
the
right
look
to
yourselves
laws
do
not
check
their
action
for
your
ignorance
fire
will
not
cease
to
scorch
because
you
not
know
with
equal
vigour
did
i
maintain
that
virtue
was
its
own
reward
and
that
payment
on
the
other
side
of
the
grave
was
unnecessary
as
an
incentive
to
right
living
what
shall
we
say
to
miss
contention
that
duty
will
grey
and
cold
without
god
and
immortality
yes
for
those
with
whom
duty
is
a
matter
of
selfish
calculation
and
who
are
virtuous
only
because
they
look
for
a
crown
in
payment
on
the
other
side
the
grave
those
of
us
who
find
joy
in
who
work
because
work
is
useful
to
our
fellows
who
live
well
because
in
such
living
we
pay
our
contribution
to
the
world
wealth
leaving
earth
richer
than
we
found
it
we
need
no
paltry
payment
after
death
for
our
life
labour
for
in
that
labour
is
its
own
great
reward
but
did
any
one
yearn
for
immortality
that
not
all
of
me
shall
die
is
it
true
that
atheism
has
no
immortality
what
is
true
immortality
is
beethoven
true
immortality
in
his
continued
personal
consciousness
or
in
his
glorious
music
deathless
while
the
world
endures
is
shelley
true
life
in
his
existence
in
some
heaven
or
in
the
pulsing
liberty
his
lyrics
send
through
men
hearts
when
they
respond
to
the
strains
of
his
lyre
music
does
not
die
though
one
instrument
be
broken
thought
does
not
die
though
one
brain
be
shivered
love
does
not

though
one

strings
be
rent
and
no
great
thinker
dies
so
long
as
his
thought
through
the
ages
its
melody
the
the
more
human
brains
send
its
music
on
not
only
to
the
hero
and
the
sage
is
this
immortality
given
it
belongs
to
each
according
to
the
measure
of
his
deeds
life
for
service
straitened
life
for
straitened
work
each
reaps
as
he
sows
and
the
harvest
is
gathered
by
each
in
his
rightful
order
this
longing
to
leave
behind
a
name
that
will
live
among
men
by
right
of
service
done
them
this
yearning
for
human
love
and
approval
that
springs
naturally
from
the
practical
and
intense
realisation
of
human
brotherhood
these
will
be
found
as
strong
motives
in
the
breasts
of
the
most
earnest
men
and
women
who
have
in
our
generation
identified
themselves
with
the
freethought
cause
they
shine
through
the
written
and
spoken
words
of
charles
bradlaugh
all
through
his
life
and
every
friend
of
his
knows
how
often
he
has
expressed
the
longing
that
when
the
grass
grows
green
over
my
grave
men
may
love
me
a
little
for
the
work
i
tried
to
do
needless
to
say
that
in
the
many
controversies
in
which
i
took
part
it
was
often
urged
against
me
that
such
motives
were
insufficient
that
they
appealed
only
to
natures
already
ethically
developed
and
left
the
average
man
and
above
all
the
man
below
the
average
with
no
sufficiently
constraining
motive
for
right
conduct
i
resolutely
held
to
my
faith
in
human
nature
and
the
inherent
response
of
the
human
heart
when
appealed
to
from
the
highest
grounds
strange
i
often
think
now
this
instinctive
certainty
i
had
of
man
innate
grandeur
that
governed
all
my
thought
inconsistent
as
that
certainty
was
with
my
belief
in
his
purely
animal
ancestry
pressed
too
hard
i
would
take
refuge
in
a
passionate
disdain
for
all
who
did
not
hear
the
thrilling
voice
of
virtue
and
love
her
for
her
own
sweet
sake
i
have
myself
heard
the
question
asked
should
i
seek
for
truth
and
why
should
i
lead
a
good
life
if
there
be
no
immortality
in
which
to
reap
a
reward
to
this
question
the
freethinker
has
one
clear
and
short
answer
is
no
reason
why
you
should
seek
truth
if
to
you
the
search
has
no
attracting
power
there
is
no
reason
why
you
should
lead
a
noble
life
if
you
find
your
happiness
in
leading
a
poor
and
a
base
one
friends
no
one
can
enjoy
a
happiness
which
is
too
high
for
his
capabilities
a
book
may
be
of
intensest
interest
but
a
dog
will
very
much
prefer
being
given
a
bone
to
him
whose
highest
interest
is
centred
in
his
own
miserable
self
to
him
who
cares
only
to
gain
his
own
ends
to
him
who
seeks
only
his
own
individual
comfort
to
that
man
freethought
can
have
no
attraction
such
a
man
may
indeed
be
made
religious
by
a
bribe
of
heaven
he
may
be
led
to
seek
for
truth
because
he
hopes
to
gain
his
reward
hereafter
by
the
search
but
truth
disdains
the
service
of
the
she
can
not
be
grasped
by
a
hand
that
itches
for
reward
if
truth
is
not
loved
for
her
own
pure
sake
if
to
lead
a
noble
life
if
to
make
men
happier
if
to
spread
brightness
around
us
if
to
leave
the
world
better
than
we
found
it
if
these
aims
have
no
attraction
for
us
if
these
thoughts
do
not
inspire
us
then
we
are
not
worthy
to
be
secularists
we
have
no
right
to
the
proud
title
of
freethinkers
if
you
want
to
be
paid
for
your
good
lives
by
living
for
ever
in
a
lazy
and
useless
fashion
in
an
idle
heaven
if
you
want
to
be
bribed
into
nobility
of
life
if
like
silly
children
you
learn
your
lesson
not
to
gain
knowledge
but
to
win
then
you
had
better
go
back
to
your
creeds
and
your
churches
they
are
all
you
are
fit
for
you
are
not
worthy
to
be
free
but
we
who
having
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
beauty
of
truth
deem
the
possession
of
her
worth
more
than
all
the
world
beside
who
have
made
up
our
minds
to
do
our
work
ungrudgingly
asking
for
no
reward
beyond
the
results
which
spring
up
from
our
labour
we
will
spread
the
gospel
of
freethought
among
men
until
the
sad
minor
melodies
of
christianity
have
sobbed
out
their
last
mournful
notes
on
the
dying
evening
breeze
and
on
the
fresh
morning
winds
shall
ring
out
the
chorus
of
hope
and
joyfulness
from
the
glad
lips
of
men
whom
the
truth
has
at
last
set
free
the
intellectual
comprehension
of
the
sources
of
evil
and
the
method
of
its
extinction
was
the
second
great
plank
in
my
ethical
platform
the
study
of
darwin
and
herbert
spencer
of
huxley
büchner
and
haeckel
had
not
only
convinced
me
of
the
truth
of
evolution
but
with
help
from
clifford
lubbock
buckle
lecky
and
many
another
had
led
me
to
see
in
the
evolution
of
the
social
instinct
the
explanation
of
the
growth
of
conscience
and
of
the
strengthening
of
man
mental
and
moral
nature
if
man
by
study
of
the
conditions
surrounding
him
and
by
the
application
of
intelligence
to
the
subdual
of
external
nature
had
already
accomplished
so
much
why
should
not
further
persistence
along
the
same
road
lead
to
his
complete
emancipation
all
the
evil
side
of
his
nature
was
an
inheritance
from
his
brute
ancestry
and
could
be
gradually
eradicated
he
could
not
only
let
the
ape
and
tiger
die
but
he
could
kill
them
out
it
may
be
frankly
acknowledged
that
man
inherits
from
his
brute
progenitors
various
bestial
tendencies
which
are
in
course
of
elimination
the
desire
to
fight
is
one
of
these
and
this
has
been
encouraged
not
checked
by
religion
another
bestial
tendency
is
the
lust
of
the
male
for
the
female
apart
from
love
duty
and
loyalty
this
again
has
been
encouraged
by
religion
as
witness
the
polygamy
and
concubinage
of
the
hebrews
as
in
abraham
david
and
solomon
not
to
mention
the
precepts
of
the
mosaic
laws
the
bands
of
male
and
female
prostitutes
in
connection
with
pagan
temples
and
the
curious
outbursts
of
sexual
passion
in
connection
with
religious
revivals
and
missions
another
bestial
tendency
is
greed
the
strongest
grabbing
all
he
can
and
trampling
down
the
weak
in
the
mad
struggle
for
wealth
how
and
when
has
religion
modified
this
tendency
sanctified
as
it
is
in
our
present
civilisation
all
these
bestial
tendencies
will
be
eradicated
only
by
the
recognition
of
human
duty
of
the
social
bond
religion
has
not
eradicated
them
but
science
by
tracing
them
to
their
source
in
our
brute
ancestry
has
explained
them
and
has
shown
them
in
their
true
light
as
each
recognises
that
the
tendencies
are
the
bestial
tendencies
in
man
and
that
man
in
evolving
further
must
evolve
out
of
these
each
also
feels
it
part
of
his
personal
duty
to
curb
these
in
himself
and
so
to
rise
further
from
the
brute
this
rational
with
nature
distinguishes
the
scientific
from
the
religious
person
and
this
constraining
sense
of
obligation
is
becoming
stronger
and
stronger
in
all
those
who
in
losing
faith
in
god
have
gained
hope
for
man
for
this
rational
setting
of
oneself
on
the
side
of
the
forces
working
for
evolution
implied
active
by
personal
purity
and
nobility
to
the
atheist
it
seems
that
the
knowledge
that
the
perfecting
of
the
race
is
only
possible
by
the
improvement
of
the
individual
supplies
the
most
constraining
motive
which
can
be
imagined
for
efforts
after
personal
perfection
the
theist
may
desire
personal
perfection
but
his
desire
is
each
righteous
individual
is
righteous
as
it
were
alone
and
his
righteousness
does
not
benefit
his
fellows
save
as
it
may
make
him
helpful
and
loving
in
his
dealings
with
them
the
atheist
desires
personal
perfection
not
only
for
his
joy
in
it
as
beautiful
in
itself
but
because
science
has
taught
him
the
unity
of
the
race
and
he
knows
that
each
fresh
conquest
of
his
over
the
baser
parts
of
his
nature
and
each
strengthening
of
the
higher
is
a
gain
for
all
and
not
for
himself
alone
besides
all
this
the
struggle
against
evil
regarded
as
transitory
and
as
a
necessary
concomitant
of
evolution
loses
its
bitterness
in
dealing
with
evil
atheism
is
full
of
hope
instead
of
despair
to
the
christian
evil
is
as
everlasting
as
good
it
exists
by
the
permission
of
god
and
therefore
by
the
will
of
god
our
nature
is
corrupt
inclined
to
evil
the
devil
is
ever
near
us
working
all
sin
and
all
misery
what
hope
has
the
christian
face
to
face
with
a
wickedness
what
answer
to
the
question
whence
comes
sin
to
the
atheist
the
terrible
problem
has
in
it
no
figure
of
despair
evil
comes
from
ignorance
we
say
ignorance
of
physical
and
of
moral
facts
primarily
from
ignorance
of
physical
order
parents
who
dwell
in
filthy
unventilated
unweathertight
houses
who
live
on
insufficient
innutritious
unwholesome
food
will
necessarily
be
unhealthy
will
lack
vitality
will
probably
have
disease
lurking
in
their
veins
such
parents
will
bring
into
the
world
children
in
whom
the
brain
will
generally
be
the
least
developed
part
of
the
body
such
children
by
their
very
formation
will
incline
to
the
animal
rather
than
to
the
human
and
by
leading
an
animal
or
natural
life
will
be
deficient
in
those
qualities
which
are
necessary
in
social
life
their
surroundings
as
they
grow
up
the
home
the
food
the
associates
all
are
bad
they
are
trained
into
vice
educated
into
criminality
so
surely
as
from
the
sown
corn
rises
the
so
from
the
sowing
of
misery
filth
and
starvation
shall
arise
crime
and
the
root
of
all
is
poverty
and
ignorance
educate
the
children
and
give
them
fair
wage
for
fair
work
in
their
maturity
and
crime
will
gradually
diminish
and
ultimately
disappear
man
is
says
theism
man
is
says
atheism
man
is
the
resultant
of
what
his
parents
were
of
what
his
surroundings
have
been
and
are
and
of
what
they
have
made
him
himself
the
result
of
the
past
he
modifies
the
actual
and
so
the
action
and
reaction
go
on
he
himself
the
effect
of
what
is
past
and
one
of
the
causes
of
what
is
to
come
make
the
circumstances
good
and
the
results
will
be
good
for
healthy
bodies
and
healthy
brains
may
be
built
up
and
from
a
state
composed
of
such
the
disease
of
crime
will
have
disappeared
thus
is
our
work
full
of
hope
no
terrible
will
of
god
have
we
to
struggle
against
no
despairful
future
to
look
forward
to
of
a
world
growing
more
and
more
evil
until
it
is
at
last
to
burned
up
but
a
glad
fair
future
of
an
race
where
more
equal
laws
more
general
education
more
just
division
shall
eradicate
pauperism
destroy
ignorance
nourish
independence
a
future
to
be
made
the
grander
by
our
struggles
a
future
to
be
made
the
nearer
by
our
toil
this
joyous
facing
of
the
world
with
the
resolute
determination
to
improve
it
is
characteristic
of
the
noblest
atheism
of
our
day
and
it
is
thus
a
distintly
elevating
factor
in
the
midst
of
the
selfishness
luxury
and
greed
of
modern
civilisation
it
is
a
virile
virtue
in
the
midst
of
the
calculating
and
slothful
spirit
which
too
ofter
veils
itself
under
the
pretence
or
religion
it
will
have
no
putting
off
of
justice
to
a
day
of
reckoning
and
it
is
ever
spurred
on
by
the
feeling
the
night
cometh
when
no
man
can
work
bereft
of
all
hope
of
a
personal
future
it
binds
up
its
hopes
with
that
of
the
race
unbelieving
in
any
aid
from
deity
it
struggles
the
more
strenuously
to
work
out
man
salvation
by
his
own
strength
to
us
there
is
but
small
comfort
in
miss
cobbe
assurance
that
wrongs
and
agonies
be
righted
hereafter
granting
for
a
moment
that
man
survives
death
what
certainty
have
we
that
next
world
will
be
any
improvement
on
this
miss
cobbe
assures
us
that
this
is
world
whose
world
will
the
next
be
if
not
also
his
will
he
be
stronger
there
or
better
that
he
should
set
right
in
that
world
the
wrongs
he
has
permitted
here
will
he
have
changed
his
mind
or
have
become
weary
of
the
contemplation
of
suffering
to
me
the
thought
that
the
world
was
in
the
hands
of
a
god
who
permitted
all
the
present
wrongs
and
pains
to
exist
would
be
intolerable
maddening
in
its
hopelessness
there
is
every
hope
of
righting
earth
wrongs
and
of
curing
earth
pains
if
the
reason
and
skill
of
man
which
have
already
done
so
much
are
free
to
do
the
rest
but
if
they
are
to
strive
against
omnipotence
hopeless
indeed
is
the
future
of
the
world
it
is
in
this
sense
that
the
atheist
looks
on
good
as
final
goal
of
ill
and
believing
that
that
goal
will
be
reached
the
sooner
the
more
strenuous
the
efforts
of
each
individual
he
works
in
the
glad
certainty
that
he
is
aiding
the
world
progress
thitherward
not
dreaming
of
a
personal
reward
hereafter
not
craving
a
personal
payment
from
heavenly
treasury
he
works
and
loves
content
that
he
is
building
a
future
fairer
than
his
present
joyous
that
he
is
creating
a
new
earth
for
a
happier
race
such
was
the
creed
and
such
the
morality
which
governed
my
life
and
thoughts
from
to
and
with
some
misgivings
to
and
from
which
i
drew
strength
and
happiness
amid
all
outer
struggles
and
distress
and
i
shall
ever
remain
grateful
for
the
intellectual
and
moral
training
it
gave
me
for
the
it
nurtured
for
the
altruism
it
inculcated
for
the
deep
feeling
of
the
unity
of
man
that
it
fostered
for
the
inspiration
to
work
that
it
lent
and
perhaps
the
chief
debt
of
gratitude
i
owe
to
freethought
is
that
it
left
the
mind
ever
open
to
new
truth
encouraged
the
most
unshrinking
questioning
of
nature
and
shrank
from
no
new
conclusions
however
adverse
to
the
old
that
were
based
on
solid
evidence
i
admit
sorrowfully
that
all
freethinkers
do
not
learn
this
lesson
but
i
worked
side
by
side
with
charles
bradlaugh
and
the
freethought
we
strove
to
spread
was
and
the
antagonism
which
as
we
shall
see
in
a
few
moments
blazed
out
against
me
from
the
commencement
of
my
platform
work
was
based
partly
on
ignorance
was
partly
aroused
by
my
direct
attacks
on
christianity
and
by
the
combative
spirit
i
myself
showed
in
those
attacks
and
very
largely
by
my
extreme
radicalism
in
politics
i
had
against
me
all
the
conventional
beliefs
and
traditions
of
society
in
general
and
i
attacked
them
not
with
bated
breath
and
abundant
apologies
but
joyously
and
defiantly
with
sheer
delight
in
the
intellectual
strife
i
was
fired
too
with
passionate
sympathy
for
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
for
the
overburdened
overdriven
masses
of
the
people
not
only
here
but
in
every
land
and
wherever
a
blow
was
struck
at
liberty
or
justice
my
pen
or
tongue
brake
silence
it
was
a
perpetual
carrying
of
the
fiery
cross
and
the
comfortable
did
not
thank
me
for
shaking
them
out
of
their
soft
repose
the
antagonism
that
grew
out
of
ignorance
regarded
atheism
as
implying
degraded
morality
and
bestial
life
and
they
assailed
my
conduct
not
on
evidence
that
it
was
evil
but
on
the
presumption
that
an
atheist
must
be
immoral
thus
a
christian
opponent
at
leicester
assailed
me
as
a
teacher
of
free
love
fathering
on
me
views
which
were
maintained
in
a
book
that
i
had
not
read
but
which
before
i
had
ever
seen
the
had
been
reviewed
in
its
columns
as
it
was
reviewed
in
other
london
papers
and
had
been
commended
for
its
clear
statement
of
the
malthusian
position
but
not
for
its
contention
as
to
free
love
a
theory
to
which
bradlaugh
was
very
strongly
opposed
nor
were
the
attacks
confined
to
the
ascription
to
me
of
theories
which
i
did
not
hold
but
agents
of
the
christian
evidence
society
in
their
street
preaching
made
the
foulest
accusations
against
me
of
personal
immorality
remonstrances
addressed
to
the
rev
engström
the
secretary
of
the
society
brought
voluble
protestations
of
disavowal
and
disapproval
but
as
the
peccant
agents
were
continued
in
their
employment
the
apologies
were
of
small
value
no
accusation
was
too
coarse
no
slander
too
baseless
for
circulation
by
these
men
and
for
a
long
time
these
indignities
caused
me
bitter
suffering
outraging
my
pride
and
soiling
my
good
name
the
time
was
to
come
when
i
should
throw
that
good
name
to
the
winds
for
the
sake
of
the
miserable
but
in
those
early
days
i
had
done
nothing
to
merit
even
ostensibly
such
attacks
even
by
educated
writers
who
should
have
known
better
the
most
wanton
accusations
of
violence
and
destructiveness
were
brought
against
atheists
thus
miss
frances
power
cobbe
wrote
in
the
that
loss
of
faith
in
god
would
bring
about
the
secularisation
of
all
cathedrals
churches
and
chapels
why
i
wrote
in
answer
should
cathedrals
churches
and
chapels
be
destroyed
atheism
will
utilise
not
destroy
the
beautiful
edifices
which
once
wasted
on
god
shall
hereafter
be
consecrated
for
man
destroy
westminster
abbey
with
its
exquisite
arches
its
glorious
tones
of
soft
rich
colour
its
stonework
light
as
if
of
cloud
its
dreamy
subdued
twilight
soothing
as
the
of
a
great
rock
in
a
weary
land
nay
but
reconsecrate
it
to
humanity
the
fat
cherubs
who
tumble
over
guns
and
banners
on
soldiers
graves
will
fitly
be
removed
to
some
spot
where
their
clumsy
forms
will
no
longer
mar
the
grace
of
lines
of
pillar
and
of
arch
but
the
glorious
building
wherein
now
barbaric
psalms
are
chanted
and
droning
canons
preach
of
eastern
follies
shall
hereafter
echo
the
majestic
music
of
wagner
and
beethoven
and
the
teachers
of
the
future
shall
there
unveil
to
thronging
multitudes
the
beauties
and
the
wonders
of
the
world
the
and
spires
will
not
be
effaced
but
they
will
no
longer
be
symbols
of
a
religion
which
sacrifices
earth
to
heaven
and
man
to
god
between
the
cultured
and
the
uncultured
burlesques
of
atheism
we
came
off
pretty
badly
being
for
the
most
part
regarded
as
the
late
cardinal
manning
termed
us
as
mere
cattle
the
moral
purity
and
elevation
of
atheistic
teaching
were
overlooked
by
many
who
heard
only
of
my
bitter
attacks
on
christian
theology
against
the
teachings
of
eternal
torture
of
the
vicarious
atonement
of
the
infallibility
of
the
bible
i
levelled
all
the
strength
of
my
brain
and
tongue
and
i
exposed
the
history
of
the
christian
church
with
unsparing
hand
its
persecutions
its
religious
wars
its
cruelties
its
oppressions
smarting
under
the
suffering
inflicted
on
myself
and
wroth
with
the
cruel
pressure
continually
put
on
freethinkers
by
christian
employers
speaking
under
constant
threats
of
prosecution
identifying
christianity
with
the
political
and
social
tyrannies
of
christendom
i
used
every
weapon
that
history
science
criticism
scholarship
could
give
me
against
the
churches
eloquence
sarcasm
mockery
all
were
called
on
to
make
breaches
in
the
wall
of
traditional
belief
and
crass
superstition
to
argument
and
reason
i
was
ever
ready
to
listen
but
i
turned
a
front
of
stubborn
defiance
to
all
attempts
to
compel
assent
to
christianity
by
appeals
to
force
the
threat
and
the
enforcement
of
legal
and
social
penalties
against
unbelief
can
never
compel
belief
belief
must
be
gained
by
demonstration
it
can
never
be
forced
by
punishment
persecution
makes
the
stronger
among
us
bitter
the
weaker
among
us
hypocrites
it
never
has
made
and
never
can
make
an
honest
convert
that
men
and
women
are
now
able
to
speak
and
think
as
openly
as
they
do
that
a
broader
spirit
is
visible
in
the
churches
that
heresy
is
no
longer
regarded
as
morally
disgraceful
these
things
are
very
largely
due
to
the
active
and
militant
propaganda
carried
on
under
the
leadership
of
charles
bradlaugh
whose
nearest
and
most
trusted
friend
i
was
that
my
tongue
was
in
the
early
days
bitterer
than
it
should
have
been
i
frankly
acknowledge
that
i
ignored
the
services
done
by
christianity
and
threw
light
only
on
its
crimes
thus
committing
injustice
i
am
ready
to
admit
but
these
faults
were
conquered
long
ere
i
left
the
atheistic
camp
and
they
were
the
faults
of
my
personality
not
of
the
atheistic
philosophy
and
my
main
contentions
were
true
and
needed
to
be
made
from
many
a
christian
pulpit
may
be
heard
the
echo
of
the
freethought
teachings
men
minds
have
been
awakened
their
knowledge
enlarged
and
while
i
condemn
the
unnecessary
harshness
of
some
of
my
language
i
rejoice
that
i
played
my
part
in
that
educating
of
england
which
has
made
impossible
for
evermore
the
crude
superstitions
of
the
past
and
the
repetition
of
the
cruelties
and
injustices
under
which
preceding
heretics
suffered
but
my
extreme
political
views
had
also
much
to
do
with
the
general
feeling
of
hatred
with
which
i
was
regarded
politics
as
such
i
cared
not
for
at
all
for
the
necessary
compromises
of
political
life
were
intolerable
to
me
but
wherever
they
touched
on
the
life
of
the
people
they
became
to
me
of
burning
interest
the
land
question
the
incidence
of
taxation
the
cost
of
royalty
the
obstructive
power
of
the
house
of
lords
these
were
the
matters
to
which
i
put
my
hand
i
was
a
home
ruler
too
of
course
and
a
passionate
opponent
of
all
injustice
to
nations
weaker
than
ourselves
so
that
i
found
myself
always
in
opposition
to
the
government
of
the
day
against
our
aggressive
and
oppressive
policy
in
ireland
in
the
transvaal
in
india
in
afghanistan
in
burmah
in
egypt
i
lifted
up
my
voice
in
all
our
great
towns
trying
to
touch
the
consciences
of
the
people
and
to
make
them
feel
the
immorality
of
a
piratical
policy
against
war
against
capital
punishment
against
flogging
demanding
national
education
instead
of
big
guns
public
libraries
instead
of
warships
no
wonder
i
was
denounced
as
an
agitator
a
firebrand
and
that
all
orthodox
society
turned
up
at
me
its
most
respectable
nose
chapter
viii
at
work
from
this
sketch
of
the
inner
sources
of
action
let
me
turn
to
the
actions
themselves
and
see
how
the
outer
life
was
led
which
fed
itself
at
these
springs
i
have
said
that
the
friendship
between
bradlaugh
and
myself
dated
from
our
first
meeting
and
a
few
days
after
our
talk
in
turner
street
he
came
down
to
see
me
at
norwood
it
was
characteristic
of
the
man
that
he
refused
my
first
invitation
and
bade
me
to
think
well
ere
i
asked
him
to
my
house
he
told
me
that
he
was
so
hated
by
english
society
that
any
friend
of
his
would
be
certain
to
suffer
and
that
i
should
pay
heavily
for
any
friendship
extended
to
him
when
however
i
wrote
to
him
repeating
my
invitation
and
telling
him
that
i
had
counted
the
cost
he
came
to
see
me
his
words
came
true
my
friendship
for
him
alienated
from
me
even
many
professed
freethinkers
but
the
strength
and
the
happiness
of
it
outweighed
a
thousand
times
the
loss
it
brought
and
never
has
a
shadow
of
regret
touched
me
that
i
clasped
hands
with
him
in
and
won
the
noblest
friend
that
woman
ever
had
he
never
spoke
to
me
a
harsh
word
where
we
differed
he
never
tried
to
override
my
judgment
nor
force
on
me
his
views
we
discussed
all
points
of
difference
as
equal
friends
he
guarded
me
from
all
suffering
as
far
as
friend
might
and
shared
with
me
all
the
pain
he
could
not
turn
aside
all
the
brightness
of
my
stormy
life
came
to
me
through
him
from
his
tender
thoughtfulness
his
sympathy
his
generous
love
he
was
the
most
unselfish
man
i
ever
knew
and
as
patient
as
he
was
strong
my
quick
impulsive
nature
found
in
him
the
restful
strength
it
needed
and
learned
from
him
the
it
lacked
he
was
the
merriest
of
companions
in
our
rare
hours
of
relaxation
for
many
years
he
was
wont
to
come
to
my
house
in
the
morning
after
the
hours
always
set
aside
by
him
for
receiving
poor
men
who
wanted
advice
on
legal
and
other
matters
for
he
was
a
veritable
poor
man
lawyer
always
ready
to
help
and
counsel
and
bringing
his
books
and
papers
he
would
sit
writing
hour
after
hour
i
equally
busy
with
my
own
work
now
and
then
perhaps
exchanging
a
word
breaking
off
just
for
lunch
and
dinner
and
working
on
again
in
the
evening
till
about
ten
he
always
went
early
to
bed
when
at
home
he
would
take
himself
off
again
to
his
lodgings
about
of
a
mile
away
sometimes
he
would
play
cards
for
an
hour
euchre
being
our
favourite
game
but
while
we
were
mostly
busy
and
grave
we
would
make
holiday
sometimes
and
then
he
was
like
a
boy
brimming
over
with
mirth
full
of
quaint
turns
of
thought
and
speech
all
the
country
round
london
has
for
me
bright
memories
of
our
wanderings
richmond
where
we
tramped
across
the
park
and
sat
under
its
mighty
trees
windsor
with
its
groves
of
bracken
kew
where
we
had
tea
in
a
funny
little
room
with
watercress
hampton
court
with
its
dishevelled
beauties
maidenhead
and
taplow
where
the
river
was
the
attraction
and
above
all
broxbourne
where
he
delighted
to
spend
the
day
with
his
wandering
along
the
river
of
which
he
knew
every
eddy
for
he
was
a
great
fisherman
and
he
taught
me
all
the
mysteries
of
the
craft
mirthfully
disdainful
of
my
dislike
of
the
fish
when
i
had
caught
them
and
in
those
days
he
would
talk
of
all
his
hopes
of
the
future
of
his
work
of
his
duty
to
the
thousands
who
looked
to
him
for
guidance
of
the
time
when
he
would
sit
in
parliament
as
member
for
northampton
and
help
to
pass
into
laws
the
projects
of
reform
for
which
he
was
battling
with
pen
and
tongue
how
often
he
would
voice
his
love
of
england
his
admiration
of
her
parliament
his
pride
in
her
history
keenly
alive
to
the
blots
upon
it
in
her
sinful
wars
of
conquest
in
the
cruel
wrongs
inflicted
upon
subject
peoples
he
was
yet
an
englishman
to
the
heart
core
but
feeling
above
all
the
englishman
duty
as
one
of
a
race
that
had
gripped
power
and
held
it
to
understand
the
needs
of
those
he
ruled
and
to
do
justice
willingly
since
compulsion
to
justice
there
was
none
his
service
to
india
in
the
latest
years
of
his
life
was
no
suddenly
accepted
task
he
had
spoken
for
her
pleaded
for
her
for
many
a
long
year
through
press
and
on
platform
and
his
spurs
as
member
for
india
were
won
long
ere
he
was
member
of
parliament
a
place
on
the
staff
of
the
was
offered
me
by
bradlaugh
a
few
days
after
our
first
meeting
and
the
small
weekly
salary
thus
earned
it
was
only
a
guinea
for
national
reformers
are
always
poor
was
a
very
welcome
addition
to
my
resources
my
first
contribution
appeared
in
the
number
for
august
over
the
signature
of
ajax
and
i
wrote
in
it
regularly
until
bradlaugh
died
from
until
his
death
i
it
so
as
to
free
him
from
all
the
technical
trouble
and
the
weary
reading
of
copy
and
for
part
of
this
period
was
also
i
wrote
at
first
under
a
de
because
the
work
i
was
doing
for
scott
would
have
been
prejudiced
had
my
name
appeared
in
the
columns
of
the
terrible
and
until
this
work
commenced
and
paid
for
was
concluded
i
did
not
feel
at
liberty
to
use
my
own
name
afterwards
i
signed
my
articles
and
the
tracts
written
for
scott
appeared
anonymously
the
name
was
suggested
by
the
famous
statue
of
ajax
crying
for
light
a
cast
of
which
may
be
seen
in
the
centre
walk
by
any
visitor
to
the
crystal
palace
sydenham
the
cry
through
the
darkness
for
light
even
though
light
should
bring
destruction
was
one
that
awoke
the
keenest
sympathy
of
response
from
my
heart
if
our
fate
be
death
give
light
and
let
us
die
to
see
to
know
to
understand
even
though
the
seeing
blind
though
the
knowledge
sadden
though
the
understanding
shatter
the
dearest
hopes
such
has
ever
been
the
craving
of
the
mind
in
man
some
regard
it
as
a
weakness
as
a
folly
but
i
am
sure
that
it
exists
most
strongly
in
some
of
the
noblest
of
our
race
that
from
the
lips
of
those
who
have
done
most
in
lifting
the
burden
of
ignorance
from
the
overstrained
and
bowed
shoulders
of
a
stumbling
world
has
gone
out
most
often
into
the
empty
darkness
the
pleading
impassioned
cry
give
light
the
light
may
come
with
a
blinding
flash
but
it
is
light
none
the
less
and
we
can
see
and
now
the
time
had
come
when
i
was
to
use
that
gift
of
speech
which
i
had
discovered
in
sibsey
church
that
i
possessed
and
to
use
it
to
move
hearts
and
brains
all
over
the
english
land
in
tentatively
and
in
definitely
i
took
up
this
keen
weapon
and
have
used
it
ever
since
my
first
attempt
was
at
a
garden
party
in
a
brief
informal
debate
and
i
found
that
words
came
readily
and
smoothly
the
second
in
a
discussion
at
the
liberal
social
union
on
the
opening
of
museums
and
art
galleries
on
sunday
my
first
lecture
was
given
at
the
institute
castle
street
oxford
street
on
august
greening
then
i
think
the
secretary
had
invited
me
to
read
a
paper
before
the
society
and
had
left
me
the
choice
of
the
subject
i
resolved
that
my
first
public
lecture
should
be
on
behalf
of
my
own
sex
so
i
selected
for
my
theme
the
political
status
of
women
and
wrote
thereon
a
paper
but
it
was
a
very
nervous
person
who
presented
herself
at
the
institute
on
that
august
evening
when
a
visit
to
the
dentist
is
made
and
one
stands
on
the
steps
outside
desiring
to
run
away
ere
the
neat
little
boy
in
buttons
opens
the
door
and
beams
on
one
with
a
smile
of
compassionate
superiority
and
implike
triumph
then
the
world
seems
dark
and
life
is
as
a
huge
blunder
but
all
such
feelings
are
poor
and
weak
as
compared
with
the
sinking
of
the
heart
and
the
trembling
of
the
knees
which
seize
upon
the
unhappy
lecturer
as
he
advances
towards
his
first
audience
and
as
before
his
eyes
rises
a
ghastly
vision
of
a
lecturer
facing
rows
of
listening
faces
listening
to
silence
but
to
my
surprise
all
this
miserable
feeling
vanished
the
moment
i
was
on
my
feet
and
was
looking
at
the
faces
before
me
i
felt
no
tremor
of
nervousness
from
the
first
word
to
the
last
and
as
i
heard
my
own
voice
ring
out
over
the
attentive
listeners
i
was
conscious
of
power
and
of
pleasure
not
of
fear
and
from
that
day
to
this
my
experience
has
been
the
same
before
a
lecture
i
am
horribly
nervous
wishing
myself
at
the
ends
of
the
earth
heart
beating
violently
and
sometimes
overcome
by
deadly
sickness
once
on
my
feet
i
feel
perfectly
at
my
ease
ruler
of
the
crowd
master
of
myself
i
often
jeer
at
myself
mentally
as
i
feel
myself
throbbing
and
fearful
knowing
that
when
i
stand
up
i
shall
be
all
right
and
yet
i
can
not
conquer
the
physical
terror
and
trembling
illusory
as
i
know
them
to
be
people
often
say
to
me
you
look
too
ill
to
go
on
the
platform
and
i
smile
feebly
and
say
i
am
all
right
and
i
often
fancy
that
the
more
miserably
nervous
i
am
in
the
the
better
i
speak
when
once
on
the
platform
my
second
lecture
was
delivered
on
september
at
moncure
chapel
in
paul
road
camden
town
and
redelivered
a
few
weeks
later
at
a
unitarian
chapel
where
the
rev
peter
dean
was
minister
this
was
on
the
true
basis
of
morality
and
was
later
printed
as
a
pamphlet
which
attained
a
wide
circulation
this
was
all
i
did
in
the
way
of
speaking
in
but
i
took
silent
part
in
an
electioneering
struggle
at
northampton
where
a
seat
for
the
house
of
commons
had
fallen
vacant
by
the
death
of
charles
gilpin
bradlaugh
had
contested
the
borough
as
a
radical
in
obtaining
votes
and
again
in
february
when
he
received
of
these
no
less
than
were
plumpers
while
his
four
opponents
had
only
and
plumpers
respectively
this
band
formed
the
compact
and
personally
loyal
following
which
was
to
win
the
seat
for
its
chief
in
after
twelve
years
of
steady
struggle
and
to
return
him
over
and
over
again
to
parliament
during
the
long
contest
which
followed
his
election
and
which
ended
in
his
final
triumph
they
never
wavered
in
their
allegiance
to
our
charlie
but
stood
by
him
through
evil
report
and
good
report
when
he
was
outcast
as
when
he
was
triumphant
loving
him
with
a
deep
passionate
devotion
as
honourable
to
them
as
it
was
precious
to
him
i
have
seen
him
cry
like
a
child
at
evidences
of
their
love
for
him
he
whose
courage
no
danger
could
daunt
and
who
was
never
seen
to
blench
before
hatred
nor
change
his
stern
immobility
in
the
face
of
his
foes
iron
to
enmity
he
was
soft
as
a
woman
to
kindness
unbending
as
steel
to
pressure
he
was
ductile
as
wax
to
love
john
stuart
mill
had
the
insight
in
to
see
his
value
and
the
courage
to
recognise
it
he
strongly
supported
his
candidature
and
sent
a
donation
to
his
election
expenses
in
his
autobiography
he
wrote
pp
he
had
the
support
of
the
working
classes
having
heard
him
speak
i
knew
him
to
be
a
man
of
ability
and
he
had
proved
that
he
was
the
reverse
of
a
demagogue
by
placing
himself
in
strong
opposition
to
the
prevailing
opinion
of
the
democratic
party
on
two
such
important
subjects
as
malthusianism
and
proportional
representation
men
of
this
sort
who
while
sharing
the
democratic
feeling
of
the
working
classes
judge
political
questions
for
themselves
and
have
the
courage
to
assert
their
individual
convictions
against
popular
opposition
were
needed
as
it
seemed
to
me
in
parliament
and
i
did
not
think
that
bradlaugh
opinions
even
though
he
had
been
intemperate
in
the
expression
of
them
ought
to
exclude
him
it
has
been
said
that
mill
support
of
candidature
at
northampton
cost
him
his
own
seat
at
westminster
and
so
bitter
was
bigotry
at
that
time
that
the
statement
is
very
likely
to
be
true
on
this
mill
himself
said
it
was
the
right
thing
to
do
and
if
the
election
were
yet
to
take
place
i
would
do
it
again
at
this
election
of
september
the
second
in
the
year
for
the
general
election
had
taken
place
in
the
february
and
bradlaugh
had
been
put
up
and
defeated
during
his
absence
in
america
i
went
down
to
northampton
to
report
electioneering
incidents
for
the
and
spent
some
days
there
in
the
whirl
of
the
struggle
the
whig
party
was
more
bitter
against
bradlaugh
than
was
the
tory
strenuous
efforts
were
made
to
procure
a
liberal
candidate
who
would
be
able
at
least
to
prevent
return
and
by
dividing
the
liberal
and
radical
party
should
let
in
a
tory
rather
than
the
detested
radical
bell
and
james
and
pearce
came
on
the
scene
only
to
disappear
jacob
bright
and
arnold
morley
were
vainly
suggested
ayrton
name
was
whispered
major
lumley
was
recommended
by
bernal
osborne
kenealy
proclaimed
himself
ready
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
whigs
tillett
of
norwich
cox
of
belper
were
invited
but
neither
would
consent
to
oppose
a
good
radical
who
had
fought
two
elections
at
northampton
and
had
been
the
chosen
of
the
radical
workers
for
six
years
at
last
william
fowler
a
banker
accepted
the
task
of
handing
over
the
representation
of
a
liberal
and
radical
borough
to
a
tory
and
duly
succeeded
in
giving
the
seat
to
mereweather
a
very
reputable
tory
lawyer
bradlaugh
polled
thus
adding
another
voters
to
those
who
had
polled
for
him
in
the
previous
february
that
election
gave
me
my
first
experience
of
anything
in
the
nature
of
rioting
the
violent
abuse
levelled
against
bradlaugh
by
the
whigs
and
the
foul
and
wicked
slanders
circulated
against
him
assailing
his
private
life
and
family
relations
had
angered
almost
to
madness
those
who
knew
and
loved
him
and
when
it
was
found
that
the
unscrupulous
whig
devices
had
triumphed
had
turned
the
election
against
him
and
given
over
the
borough
to
a
tory
the
fury
broke
out
into
open
violence
one
illustration
may
be
given
as
a
type
of
these
cruel
slanders
it
was
known
that
bradlaugh
was
separated
from
his
wife
and
it
was
alleged
that
being
an
atheist
and
therefore
an
opponent
of
marriage
he
had
deserted
his
wife
and
children
and
left
them
to
the
workhouse
the
cause
of
the
separation
was
known
to
very
few
for
bradlaugh
was
chivalrously
honourable
to
women
and
he
would
not
shield
his
own
good
name
at
the
cost
of
that
of
the
wife
of
his
youth
and
the
mother
of
his
children
but
since
his
death
his
only
remaining
child
has
in
devotion
to
her
father
memory
stated
the
melancholy
truth
that
bradlaugh
gave
way
to
drink
that
for
long
years
he
bore
with
her
and
did
all
that
man
could
do
to
save
her
that
finally
hopeless
of
cure
he
broke
up
his
home
and
placed
his
wife
in
the
care
of
her
parents
in
the
country
leaving
her
daughters
with
her
while
he
worked
for
their
support
no
man
could
have
acted
more
generously
and
wisely
under
these
cruel
circumstances
than
he
did
but
it
was
perhaps
going
to
an
extreme
of
quixotism
that
he
concealed
the
real
state
of
the
case
and
let
the
public
blame
him
as
it
would
his
northampton
followers
did
not
know
the
facts
but
they
knew
him
as
an
upright
noble
man
and
these
brutal
attacks
on
his
personal
character
drove
them
wild
stray
fights
had
taken
place
during
the
election
over
these
slanders
and
defeated
by
such
foul
weapons
the
people
lost
control
of
their
passions
as
bradlaugh
was
sitting
exhausted
in
the
hotel
after
the
declaration
of
the
poll
the
landlord
rushed
in
crying
to
him
to
go
out
and
try
to
stop
the
people
or
there
would
be
murder
done
at
the
palmerston
fowler
headquarters
the
crowd
was
charging
the
door
and
the
windows
were
being
broken
with
showers
of
stones
weary
as
he
was
bradlaugh
sprang
to
his
feet
and
swiftly
made
his
way
to
the
rescue
of
those
who
had
maligned
and
defeated
him
flinging
himself
before
the
doorway
from
which
the
door
had
just
been
battered
down
he
knocked
down
one
or
two
of
the
most
violent
drove
the
crowd
back
argued
and
scolded
them
into
quietness
and
finally
dispersed
them
but
at
nine
he
had
to
leave
northampton
to
catch
the
mail
steamer
for
america
at
queenstown
and
after
he
had
left
word
went
round
that
he
had
gone
and
the
riot
he
had
quelled
broke
out
afresh
the
riot
act
was
at
last
read
the
soldiers
were
called
out
stones
flew
freely
heads
and
windows
were
broken
but
no
very
serious
harm
was
done
the
palmerston
and
the
of
the
the
whig
organ
were
the
principal
sufferers
doors
and
windows
disappearing
somewhat
completely
the
day
after
the
election
i
returned
home
and
soon
after
fell
ill
with
a
severe
attack
of
congestion
of
the
lungs
soon
after
my
recovery
i
left
norwood
and
settled
in
a
house
in
westbourne
terrace
bayswater
where
i
remained
till
in
the
following
january
after
much
thought
and
i
resolved
to
give
myself
wholly
to
propagandist
work
as
a
freethinker
and
a
social
reformer
and
to
use
my
tongue
as
well
as
my
pen
in
the
struggle
i
counted
the
cost
ere
i
determined
on
this
step
for
i
knew
that
it
would
not
only
outrage
the
feelings
of
such
new
friends
as
i
had
already
made
but
would
be
likely
to
imperil
my
custody
of
my
little
girl
i
knew
that
an
atheist
was
outside
the
law
obnoxious
to
its
penalties
but
deprived
of
its
protection
and
that
the
step
i
contemplated
might
carry
me
into
conflicts
in
which
everything
might
be
lost
and
nothing
could
be
gained
but
the
desire
to
spread
liberty
and
truer
thought
among
men
to
war
against
bigotry
and
superstition
to
make
the
world
freer
and
better
than
i
found
it
all
this
impelled
me
with
a
force
that
would
not
be
denied
i
seemed
to
hear
the
voice
of
truth
ringing
over
the
battlefield
who
will
go
who
will
speak
for
me
and
i
sprang
forward
with
passionate
enthusiasm
with
resolute
cry
here
am
i
send
me
nor
have
i
ever
regretted
for
one
hour
that
resolution
come
to
in
solitude
carried
out
amid
the
surging
life
of
men
to
devote
to
that
sacred
cause
every
power
of
brain
and
tongue
that
i
possessed
very
solemn
to
me
is
the
responsibility
of
the
public
teacher
standing
forth
in
press
and
on
platform
to
partly
mould
the
thought
of
his
time
swaying
thousands
of
readers
and
hearers
year
after
year
no
weighter
responsibility
can
any
take
no
more
sacred
charge
the
written
and
the
spoken
word
start
forces
none
may
measure
set
working
brain
after
brain
influence
numbers
unknown
to
the
forthgiver
of
the
word
work
for
good
or
for
evil
all
down
the
stream
of
time
feeling
the
greatness
of
the
career
the
solemnity
of
the
duty
i
pledged
my
word
then
to
the
cause
i
loved
that
no
effort
on
my
part
should
be
wanted
to
render
myself
worthy
of
the
privilege
of
service
that
i
took
that
i
would
read
and
study
and
would
train
every
faculty
that
i
had
that
i
would
polish
my
language
discipline
my
thought
widen
my
knowledge
and
this
at
least
i
may
say
that
if
i
have
written
and
spoken
much
i
have
studied
and
thought
more
and
that
i
have
not
given
to
my
mistress
truth
that
which
hath
cost
me
nothing
this
same
year
that
saw
me
launched
on
the
world
as
a
public
advocate
of
freethought
saw
also
the
founding
of
the
theosophical
society
to
which
my
freethought
was
to
lead
me
i
have
often
since
thought
with
pleasure
that
at
the
very
time
i
began
lecturing
in
england
blavatsky
was
at
work
in
the
united
states
preparing
the
foundation
on
which
in
november
the
theosophical
society
was
to
be
raised
and
with
deeper
pleasure
yet
have
i
found
her
writing
of
what
she
called
the
noble
work
against
superstition
done
by
charles
bradlaugh
and
myself
rendering
the
propaganda
of
theosophy
far
more
practicable
and
safer
than
it
would
otherwise
have
been
the
fight
soon
began
and
with
some
queer
little
skirmishes
i
was
a
member
of
the
liberal
social
union
and
one
night
a
discussion
arose
as
to
the
admissibility
of
atheists
to
the
society
zerffi
declared
that
he
would
not
remain
a
member
if
avowed
atheists
were
admitted
i
promptly
declared
that
i
was
an
atheist
and
that
the
basis
of
the
union
was
liberty
of
opinion
the
result
was
that
i
found
myself
and
those
that
had
been
warmly
cordial
to
me
merely
as
a
looked
askance
at
me
when
i
had
avowed
that
my
scepticism
had
advanced
beyond
their
limits
of
religious
thought
the
liberal
social
union
soon
knew
me
no
more
but
in
the
wider
field
of
work
open
before
me
the
of
this
petty
clique
troubled
me
not
at
all
i
started
my
definite
lecturing
work
at
south
place
chapel
in
january
moncure
conway
presiding
for
me
and
i
find
in
the
for
january
the
announcement
that
annie
besant
will
lecture
at
south
place
chapel
finsbury
on
and
religious
liberty
thus
i
threw
off
my
pseudonym
and
rode
into
the
field
of
battle
with
uplifted
visor
the
identification
led
to
an
odd
little
exhibition
of
bigotry
i
had
been
invited
by
the
dialectical
society
to
read
a
paper
and
had
selected
for
subject
the
existence
of
god
it
may
be
noted
in
passing
that
young
students
and
speakers
always
select
the
most
tremendous
subjects
for
their
discourses
one
advances
in
modesty
as
one
advances
in
knowledge
and
after
eighteen
years
of
platform
work
i
am
far
more
dubious
than
i
was
at
their
beginning
as
to
my
power
of
dealing
in
any
sense
adequately
with
the
problems
of
life
the
dialectical
society
had
for
some
years
held
their
meetings
in
a
room
in
adam
street
rented
from
the
social
science
association
when
the
members
gathered
as
usual
on
february
the
door
was
found
to
be
locked
and
they
had
to
gather
on
the
stairs
they
found
that
ajax
as
yet
undelivered
paper
was
too
much
for
social
science
nerves
and
that
entrance
to
their
ordinary
was
then
and
thenceforth
denied
them
so
they
with
ajax
found
refuge
at
the
charing
cross
hotel
and
speculated
merrily
on
the
eccentricities
of
religious
bigotry
on
february
i
started
on
my
first
provincial
lecturing
tour
and
after
speaking
at
birkenhead
that
evening
went
on
by
the
night
mail
to
glasgow
some
races
dog
races
i
think
had
been
going
on
and
very
unpleasant
were
many
of
the
passengers
waiting
on
the
platform
some
birkenhead
friends
had
secured
me
a
compartment
and
watched
over
me
till
the
train
began
to
move
then
after
we
had
fairly
started
the
door
was
flung
open
by
a
porter
and
a
man
was
thrust
in
who
half
tumbled
on
to
the
seat
as
he
slowly
recovered
he
stood
up
and
as
his
money
rolled
out
of
his
hand
on
to
the
floor
and
he
gazed
vaguely
at
it
i
saw
to
my
horror
that
he
was
drunk
the
position
was
not
pleasant
for
the
train
was
an
express
and
was
not
timed
to
stop
for
a
considerable
time
my
odious
spent
some
time
on
the
floor
hunting
after
his
scattered
coins
then
he
slowly
gathered
himself
up
and
presently
became
conscious
of
my
presence
he
studied
me
for
some
time
and
then
proposed
to
shut
the
window
i
assented
quietly
not
wanting
to
discuss
a
trifle
and
feeling
in
deadly
terror
alone
at
night
in
an
express
with
a
man
not
drunk
enough
to
be
helpless
but
too
drunk
to
be
controlled
never
before
nor
since
have
i
felt
so
thoroughly
frightened
i
can
see
him
still
swaying
as
he
stood
with
eyes
bleared
and
pendulous
lips
but
i
sat
there
quiet
and
outwardly
unmoved
as
is
always
my
impulse
in
danger
till
i
see
some
way
of
escape
only
grasping
a
penknife
in
my
pocket
with
a
desperate
resolve
to
use
my
feeble
weapon
as
soon
as
the
need
arose
the
man
came
towards
me
with
a
fatuous
leer
when
a
jarring
noise
was
heard
and
the
train
began
to
slacken
what
is
that
stammered
my
drunken
companion
they
are
putting
on
the
brakes
to
stop
the
train
i
answered
very
slowly
and
distinctly
though
a
very
passion
of
relief
made
it
hard
to
say
quietly
the
measured
words
the
man
sat
down
stupidly
staring
at
me
and
in
a
minute
or
two
the
train
pulled
up
at
a
station
it
had
been
stopped
by
signal
my
immobility
was
gone
in
a
moment
i
was
at
the
window
called
the
guard
and
explained
rapidly
that
i
was
a
woman
travelling
alone
and
that
a
man
was
in
the
carriage
with
the
usual
kindness
of
a
railway
official
he
at
once
moved
me
and
my
baggage
into
another
compartment
into
which
he
locked
me
and
he
kept
a
friendly
watch
over
me
at
every
station
at
which
we
stopped
until
he
landed
me
safely
at
glasgow
at
glasgow
a
room
had
been
taken
for
me
at
a
temperance
hotel
and
it
seemed
to
me
so
new
and
lonely
a
thing
to
be
all
on
my
own
account
in
a
strange
hotel
in
a
strange
city
that
i
wanted
to
sit
down
and
cry
this
feeling
to
which
i
was
too
proud
to
yield
was
probably
partly
due
to
the
extreme
greyness
and
grubbiness
of
my
surroundings
things
are
better
now
but
in
those
days
temperance
hotels
were
for
the
most
part
lacking
in
cleanliness
abstinence
from
alcohol
and
a
superfluity
of
matter
in
the
wrong
place
do
not
seem
necessary
correlatives
yet
i
rarely
went
to
a
temperance
hotel
in
which
water
was
liberally
used
for
other
purposes
than
that
of
drinking
from
glasgow
i
went
north
to
aberdeen
where
i
found
a
very
stern
and
critical
audience
not
a
sound
broke
the
stillness
as
i
walked
up
the
hall
not
a
sound
as
i
ascended
the
platform
and
faced
the
people
the
canny
scot
was
not
going
to
applaud
a
stranger
at
sight
he
was
going
to
see
what
she
was
like
first
in
grim
silence
they
listened
i
could
not
move
them
they
were
granite
like
their
own
granite
city
and
i
felt
i
would
like
to
take
off
my
head
and
throw
it
at
them
if
only
to
break
that
hard
wall
after
about
twenty
minutes
a
fortunate
phrase
drew
a
hiss
from
some
child
of
the
covenanters
i
made
a
quick
retort
there
was
a
burst
of
cheering
and
the
granite
vanished
never
after
that
did
i
have
to
complain
of
the
coldness
of
an
aberdeen
audience
back
to
london
from
aberdeen
and
a
long
weary
journey
it
was
in
a
carriage
in
the
cold
month
of
february
but
the
labour
had
in
it
a
joy
that
outpaid
all
physical
discomfort
and
the
feeling
that
i
had
found
my
work
in
the
world
gave
a
new
happiness
to
life
on
february
i
stood
for
the
first
time
on
the
platform
of
the
hall
of
science
old
street
luke
london
and
was
received
with
that
warmth
of
greeting
which
secularists
are
always
so
ready
to
extend
to
any
who
sacrifice
aught
to
join
their
ranks
that
hall
is
identified
in
my
mind
with
many
a
bitter
struggle
with
both
victory
and
defeat
but
whether
in
victory
or
in
defeat
i
found
there
always
welcome
and
the
love
and
the
courage
wherewith
secularists
stood
by
me
have
overpaid
a
thousandfold
any
poor
services
i
was
fortunate
enough
to
render
while
in
their
ranks
to
the
cause
of
liberty
and
wholly
prevent
any
bitterness
arising
in
my
mind
for
any
unfriendliness
shown
me
by
some
who
have
perhaps
overstepped
kindness
and
justice
in
their
sorrowful
wrath
at
my
renunciation
of
materialism
and
atheism
so
far
as
health
was
concerned
the
lecturing
acted
as
a
tonic
my
chest
had
always
been
a
little
delicate
and
when
i
consulted
a
doctor
on
the
possibility
of
my
standing
platform
work
he
answered
it
will
either
kill
you
or
cure
you
it
entirely
cured
the
lung
weakness
and
i
grew
strong
and
vigorous
instead
of
being
frail
and
delicate
as
of
old
it
would
be
wearisome
to
go
step
by
step
over
eighteen
years
of
platform
work
so
i
will
only
select
here
and
there
incidents
illustrative
of
the
whole
and
here
let
me
say
that
the
frequent
attacks
made
on
myself
and
others
that
we
were
attracted
to
propaganda
by
the
gains
it
offered
formed
a
somewhat
grotesque
contrast
to
the
facts
on
one
occasion
i
spent
eight
days
in
northumberland
and
durham
gave
twelve
lectures
and
made
a
deficit
of
eleven
shillings
on
the
whole
of
course
such
a
thing
could
not
happen
in
later
years
when
i
had
made
my
name
by
sheer
hard
work
but
i
fancy
that
every
secularist
lecturer
could
tell
of
similar
experiences
in
the
early
days
of
winning
his
way
the
fact
is
that
from
bradlaugh
downwards
every
one
of
us
could
have
earned
a
competence
with
comparative
ease
in
any
other
line
of
work
and
could
have
earned
it
with
public
approval
instead
of
amid
popular
reproach
much
of
my
early
lecturing
was
done
in
northumberland
and
durham
the
miners
there
are
as
a
rule
shrewd
and
men
and
very
cordial
is
the
greeting
given
by
them
to
those
they
have
reason
to
trust
at
seghill
and
at
bedlington
i
have
slept
in
their
cottages
and
have
been
welcomed
to
their
tables
and
i
have
a
vivid
memory
of
one
evening
at
seghill
after
a
lecture
when
my
host
himself
a
miner
invited
about
a
dozen
of
his
comrades
to
supper
to
meet
me
the
talk
ran
on
politics
and
i
soon
found
that
my
companions
knew
more
of
english
politics
had
a
far
shrewder
notion
of
political
methods
and
were
therefore
much
better
worth
talking
to
than
most
of
the
ordinary
men
met
at
dinner
parties
in
society
they
were
of
the
uneducated
class
despised
by
gentlemen
and
had
not
then
the
franchise
but
politically
they
were
far
better
educated
than
their
social
superiors
and
were
far
better
fitted
to
discharge
the
duties
of
citizenship
how
well
too
do
i
remember
a
drive
in
a
butcher
cart
to
give
a
lecture
in
an
spot
unapproached
by
railway
such
was
the
jolting
as
we
rattled
over
rough
roads
and
stony
places
that
i
felt
as
though
all
my
bones
were
broken
and
as
though
i
should
collapse
on
the
platform
like
a
bag
with
stones
how
kind
they
were
to
me
those
genial
cordial
miners
how
careful
for
my
comfort
and
how
motherly
were
the
women
ah
if
opponents
of
my
views
who
did
not
know
me
were
often
cruel
and
malignant
there
was
compensation
in
the
love
and
honour
in
which
good
men
and
women
all
the
country
over
held
me
and
their
devotion
outweighed
the
hatred
and
many
a
time
and
often
soothed
a
weary
and
aching
heart
lecturing
in
june
at
leicester
i
came
for
the
first
time
across
a
falsehood
that
brought
sore
trouble
and
cost
me
more
pain
than
i
care
to
tell
an
irate
christian
opponent
in
the
discussion
that
followed
the
lecture
declared
that
i
was
responsible
for
a
book
entitled
the
elements
of
social
science
which
was
he
averred
the
bible
of
secularists
i
had
never
heard
of
the
book
but
as
he
stated
that
it
was
in
favour
of
the
abolition
of
marriage
and
that
bradlaugh
agreed
with
it
i
promptly
contradicted
him
for
while
i
knew
nothing
about
the
book
i
knew
a
great
deal
about
bradlaugh
and
i
knew
that
on
the
marriage
question
he
was
conservative
rather
than
revolutionary
he
detested
free
love
doctrines
and
had
thrown
himself
strongly
on
the
side
of
the
agitation
led
so
heroically
for
many
years
by
josephine
butler
on
my
return
to
london
after
the
lecture
i
naturally
made
inquiry
as
to
the
volume
and
its
contents
and
i
found
that
it
had
been
written
by
a
doctor
of
medicine
some
years
before
and
sent
to
the
for
review
as
to
other
journals
in
ordinary
course
of
business
it
consisted
of
three
parts
the
first
advocated
from
the
standpoint
of
medical
science
what
is
roughly
known
as
free
love
the
second
was
entirely
medical
the
third
consisted
of
a
clear
and
able
exposition
of
the
law
of
population
as
laid
down
by
the
rev
malthus
and
following
the
lines
of
john
stuart
mill
insisted
that
it
was
the
duty
of
married
persons
to
voluntarily
limit
their
families
within
their
means
of
subsistence
bradlaugh
in
reviewing
the
book
said
that
it
was
written
with
honest
and
pure
intent
and
purpose
and
recommended
to
working
men
the
exposition
of
the
law
of
population
his
enemies
took
hold
of
this
recommendation
declared
that
he
shared
the
views
on
the
impermanence
of
the
marriage
tie
and
despite
his
reiterated
contradictions
they
used
extracts
against
marriage
from
the
book
as
containing
his
views
anything
more
meanly
vile
it
would
be
difficult
to
conceive
but
such
were
the
weapons
used
against
him
all
his
life
and
used
often
by
men
whose
own
lives
contrasted
most
unfavourably
with
his
own
unable
to
find
anything
in
his
own
writings
to
serve
their
purpose
they
used
this
book
to
damage
him
with
those
who
knew
nothing
at
of
his
views
what
his
enemies
feared
were
not
his
views
on
marriage
which
as
i
have
said
was
conservative
but
his
radicalism
and
his
atheism
to
discredit
him
as
politician
they
maligned
him
socially
and
the
idea
that
a
man
desires
to
abolish
marriage
and
the
home
is
a
most
convenient
poniard
and
the
one
most
certain
to
wound
this
was
the
origin
of
his
worst
difficulties
to
be
intensified
ere
long
by
his
defence
of
malthusianism
on
me
also
fell
the
same
lash
and
i
found
myself
held
up
to
hatred
as
upholder
of
views
that
i
abhorred
i
may
add
that
far
warmer
praise
than
that
bestowed
on
this
book
by
bradlaugh
was
given
by
other
writers
who
were
never
attacked
in
the
same
way
in
the
edited
by
george
jacob
holyoake
i
find
warmer
praise
of
it
than
in
the
in
the
review
the
following
passage
appears
in
some
respects
all
books
of
this
class
are
evils
but
it
would
be
weakness
and
criminal
prudery
a
prudery
as
criminal
as
vice
itself
not
to
say
that
such
a
book
as
the
one
in
question
is
not
only
a
far
lesser
evil
than
the
one
that
it
combats
but
in
one
sense
a
book
which
it
is
a
mercy
to
issue
and
courage
to
publish
the
reviewing
the
same
book
declared
it
to
be
a
very
valuable
though
rather
heterogeneous
book
this
is
we
believe
the
only
book
that
has
fully
honestly
and
in
a
scientific
spirit
recognised
all
the
elements
in
the
problem
how
are
mankind
to
triumph
over
poverty
with
its
train
of
attendant
evils
and
fearlessly
endeavoured
to
find
a
practical
solution
the
journal
of
wrote
though
quite
out
of
the
province
of
our
journal
we
can
not
refrain
from
stating
that
this
work
is
unquestionably
the
most
remarkable
one
in
many
respects
we
have
ever
met
with
though
we
differ
from
the
author
in
his
views
of
religion
and
morality
and
hold
some
of
his
remedies
to
tend
rather
to
a
dissolution
than
a
reconstruction
of
society
yet
we
are
bound
to
admit
the
benevolence
and
philanthropy
of
his
motives
the
scope
of
the
work
is
nothing
less
than
the
whole
field
of
political
economy
ernest
jones
and
others
wrote
yet
more
strongly
but
out
of
all
these
charles
bradlaugh
alone
has
been
selected
for
reproach
and
has
had
the
peculiar
views
of
the
anonymous
author
fathered
on
himself
some
of
the
lecture
work
in
those
days
was
pretty
rough
in
darwen
lancashire
in
june
was
regarded
as
a
fair
argument
addressed
to
the
atheist
lecturer
at
swansea
in
march
the
fear
of
violence
was
so
great
that
a
guarantee
against
damage
to
the
hall
was
exacted
by
the
proprietor
and
no
local
friend
had
the
courage
to
take
the
chair
for
me
in
september
at
hoyland
thanks
to
the
exertions
of
hebblethwaite
a
primitive
methodist
and
two
protestant
missionaries
i
found
the
hall
packed
with
a
crowd
that
yelled
at
me
with
great
vigour
stood
on
forms
shook
fists
at
me
and
otherwise
showed
feelings
more
warm
than
friendly
taking
advantage
of
a
lull
in
the
noise
i
began
to
speak
and
the
tumult
sank
into
quietness
but
as
i
was
leaving
the
hall
it
broke
out
afresh
and
i
walked
slowly
through
a
crowd
that
yelled
and
swore
and
struck
at
me
but
somehow
those
nearest
always
shrank
back
and
let
me
pass
in
the
dark
outside
the
hall
they
took
to
kicking
but
only
one
kick
reached
me
and
the
attempts
to
overturn
the
cab
were
foiled
by
the
driver
who
put
his
horse
at
a
gallop
later
in
the
same
month
bradlaugh
and
i
visited
congleton
together
having
been
invited
there
by
and
wolstenholme
elmy
bradlaugh
lectured
on
the
first
evening
to
an
accompaniment
of
broken
windows
and
i
sitting
with
elmy
facing
the
platform
received
a
rather
heavy
blow
on
the
back
of
the
head
from
a
stone
thrown
by
some
one
in
the
room
we
had
a
mile
and
a
half
to
walk
from
the
hall
to
the
house
and
were
accompanied
all
the
way
by
a
crowd
who
sang
hymns
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
with
interludes
of
curses
and
foul
words
on
the
following
evening
i
lectured
and
our
admirers
escorted
us
to
the
hall
in
the
middle
of
the
lecture
a
man
shouted
put
her
out
and
a
wrestler
of
the
neighbourhood
named
burbery
who
had
come
to
the
hall
with
some
friends
to
break
up
the
meeting
stood
up
as
at
a
signal
in
front
of
the
platform
and
loudly
interrupted
bradlaugh
who
was
in
the
chair
told
him
to
sit
down
and
as
he
persisted
in
interrupting
informed
him
that
he
must
either
be
quiet
or
go
out
put
me
out
shouted
burbery
striking
an
attitude
bradlaugh
left
the
platform
and
walked
up
to
the
noisy
swashbuckler
who
at
once
grappled
with
him
and
tried
to
throw
him
but
burbery
had
not
reckoned
on
the
massive
strength
of
his
opponent
and
when
the
throw
was
complete
burbery
was
underneath
amid
much
excitement
burbery
was
propelled
towards
the
door
being
gently
used
on
the
way
as
a
against
his
friends
who
rushed
to
the
rescue
and
at
the
door
was
handed
over
to
the
police
the
chairman
then
resumed
his
normal
duties
with
a
brief
go
on
to
me
and
i
promptly
went
on
finishing
the
lecture
in
peace
but
outside
the
hall
there
was
plenty
of
and
elmy
received
a
cut
on
the
temple
from
a
flint
this
stormy
work
gradually
lessened
and
my
experience
of
it
was
a
mere
trifle
compared
to
that
which
my
predecessors
had
faced
bradlaugh
early
experiences
involved
much
serious
rioting
and
harriet
law
a
woman
of
much
courage
and
of
strong
natural
ability
had
many
a
rough
meeting
in
her
lecturing
days
in
september
bradlaugh
again
sailed
for
america
still
to
earn
money
there
to
pay
his
debts
unhappily
he
was
struck
down
by
typhoid
fever
and
all
his
hopes
of
freeing
himself
thus
were
destroyed
his
life
was
despaired
of
but
the
admirable
skill
of
physician
and
nurse
pulled
him
through
said
the
this
long
and
severe
illness
has
disappointed
the
hopes
and
retarded
the
object
for
which
he
came
to
this
country
but
he
is
gentleness
and
patience
itself
in
his
sickness
in
this
strange
land
and
has
endeared
himself
greatly
to
his
physicians
and
attendants
by
his
gratitude
and
appreciation
of
the
slightest
attention
his
fortitude
in
face
of
death
was
also
much
commented
on
lying
there
as
he
did
far
from
home
and
from
all
he
loved
best
never
a
quiver
of
fear
touched
him
as
he
walked
down
into
the
valley
of
the
shadow
of
death
the
rev
frothingham
bore
public
and
admiring
testimony
in
his
own
church
to
bradlaugh
noble
serenity
at
once
fearless
and
unpretending
and
himself
a
theist
gave
willing
witness
to
the
atheist
calm
strength
he
came
back
to
us
at
the
end
of
september
worn
to
a
shadow
weak
as
a
child
and
for
many
a
long
month
he
bore
the
traces
of
his
wrestle
with
death
one
part
of
my
autumn
work
during
his
absence
was
the
delivery
and
subsequent
publication
of
six
lectures
on
the
french
revolution
that
stormy
time
had
for
me
an
intense
fascination
i
brooded
over
it
dreamed
over
it
and
longed
to
tell
the
story
from
the
people
point
of
view
i
consequently
read
a
large
amount
of
the
current
literature
of
the
time
as
well
as
louis
blanc
monumental
work
and
the
histories
of
michelet
lamartine
and
others
fortunately
for
me
bradlaugh
had
a
splendid
collection
of
books
on
the
subject
and
ere
we
left
england
he
brought
me
two
of
volumes
aristocratic
ecclesiastical
democratic
and
i
studied
all
these
diligently
and
lived
in
them
till
the
french
revolution
became
to
me
as
a
drama
in
which
i
had
myself
taken
part
and
the
actors
were
to
me
as
personal
friends
and
foes
in
this
again
as
in
so
much
of
my
public
work
i
have
to
thank
bradlaugh
for
the
influence
which
led
me
to
read
fully
all
sides
of
a
question
and
to
read
most
carefully
those
from
which
i
differed
most
ere
i
considered
myself
competent
to
write
or
to
speak
thereon
from
onwards
i
held
office
as
one
of
the
of
the
national
secular
society
a
society
founded
on
a
broad
basis
of
liberty
with
the
inspiring
motto
we
search
for
truth
bradlaugh
was
president
and
i
held
office
under
him
till
he
resigned
his
post
in
february
nine
months
after
i
had
joined
the
theosophical
society
the
under
his
judicious
and
leadership
became
a
real
force
in
the
country
theologically
and
politically
embracing
large
numbers
of
men
and
women
who
were
freethinkers
as
well
as
radicals
and
forming
a
nucleus
of
earnest
workers
able
to
gather
round
them
still
larger
numbers
of
others
and
thus
to
powerfully
affect
public
opinion
once
a
year
the
society
met
in
conference
and
many
a
strong
and
lasting
friendship
between
men
living
far
apart
dated
from
these
yearly
gatherings
so
that
all
over
the
country
spread
a
of
comradeship
between
the
staunch
followers
of
our
charlie
these
were
the
men
and
women
who
paid
his
election
expenses
over
and
over
again
supported
him
in
his
parliamentary
struggle
came
up
to
london
to
swell
the
demonstrations
in
his
favour
and
round
them
grew
up
a
huge
party
the
largest
personal
following
of
any
public
man
since
gladstone
it
was
once
said
by
an
eminent
man
who
differed
from
him
in
theology
but
passionately
supported
him
in
politics

who
loved
him
to
the
last
chapter
ix
the
knowlton
pamphlet
the
year
dawned
and
in
its
early
days
began
a
struggle
which
ending
in
victory
all
along
the
line
brought
with
it
pain
and
anguish
that
i
scarcely
care
to
recall
an
american
physician
charles
knowlton
convinced
of
the
truth
of
the
teaching
of
the
rev
malthus
and
seeing
that
that
teaching
had
either
no
practical
value
or
tended
to
the
great
increase
of
prostitution
unless
married
people
were
taught
to
limit
their
families
within
their
means
of
livelihood
wrote
a
pamphlet
on
the
voluntary
limitation
of
the
family
it
was
published
somewhere
in
the
thirties
about
i
think
and
was
sold
unchallenged
in
england
as
well
as
in
america
for
some
forty
years
philosophers
of
the
bentham
school
like
john
stuart
mill
endorsed
its
teachings
and
the
bearing
of
population
on
poverty
was
an
axiom
in
economic
literature
knowlton
work
was
a
physiological
treatise
advocating
conjugal
prudence
and
parental
responsibility
it
argued
in
favour
of
early
marriage
with
a
view
to
the
purity
of
social
life
but
as
early
marriage
between
persons
of
small
means
generally
implies
a
large
family
leading
either
to
pauperism
or
to
lack
of
necessary
food
clothing
education
and
fair
start
in
life
for
the
children
knowlton
advocated
the
restriction
of
the
number
of
the
family
within
the
means
of
subsistence
and
stated
the
methods
by
which
this
restriction
could
be
carried
out
the
book
was
never
challenged
till
a
disreputable
bristol
bookseller
put
some
copies
on
sale
to
which
he
added
some
improper
pictures
and
he
was
prosecuted
and
convicted
the
publisher
of
the
and
of
bradlaugh
and
my
books
and
pamphlets
had
taken
over
a
stock
of
knowlton
pamphlets
among
other
literature
he
bought
and
he
was
prosecuted
and
to
our
great
dismay
pleaded
guilty
we
at
once
removed
our
publishing
from
his
hands
and
after
careful
deliberation
we
decided
to
publish
the
incriminated
pamphlet
in
order
to
test
the
right
of
discussion
on
the
population
question
when
with
the
advice
to
limit
the
family
information
was
given
as
to
how
that
advice
could
be
followed
we
took
a
little
shop
printed
the
pamphlet
and
sent
notice
to
the
police
that
we
would
commence
the
sale
at
a
certain
day
and
hour
and
ourselves
sell
the
pamphlet
so
that
no
one
else
might
be
endangered
by
our
action
we
resigned
our
offices
in
the
national
secular
society
that
we
might
not
injure
the
society
but
the
executive
first
and
then
the
annual
conference
refused
to
accept
the
resignations
our
position
as
regarded
the
pamphlet
was
simple
and
definite
had
it
been
brought
to
us
for
publication
we
stated
we
should
not
have
published
it
for
it
was
not
a
treatise
of
high
merit
but
prosecuted
as
immoral
because
it
advised
the
limitation
of
the
family
it
at
once
embodied
the
right
of
publication
in
a
preface
to
the
republished
edition
we
wrote
we
republish
this
pamphlet
honestly
believing
that
on
all
questions
affecting
the
happiness
of
the
people
whether
they
be
theological
political
or
social
fullest
right
of
free
discussion
ought
to
be
maintained
at
all
hazards
we
do
not
personally
endorse
all
that
knowlton
says
his
proem
seems
to
us
full
of
philosophical
mistakes
and
as
we
are
neither
of
us
doctors
we
are
not
prepared
to
endorse
his
medical
views
but
since
progress
can
only
be
made
through
discussion
and
no
discussion
is
possible
where
differing
opinions
are
suppressed
we
claim
the
right
to
publish
all
opinions
so
that
the
public
enabled
to
see
all
sides
of
a
question
may
have
the
materials
for
forming
a
sound
judgment
we
were
not
blind
to
the
danger
to
which
this
defiance
of
the
authorities
exposed
us
but
it
was
not
the
danger
of
failure
with
the
prison
as
penalty
that
gave
us
pause
it
was
the
horrible
misconceptions
that
we
saw
might
arise
the
odious
imputations
on
honour
and
purity
that
would
follow
could
we
the
teachers
of
a
lofty
morality
venture
to
face
a
prosecution
for
publishing
what
would
be
technically
described
as
an
obscene
book
and
risk
the
ruin
of
our
future
dependent
as
that
was
on
our
fair
fame
to
bradlaugh
it
meant
as
he
felt
the
almost
certain
destruction
of
his
parliamentary
position
the
forging
by
his
own
hands
of
a
weapon
that
in
the
hands
of
his
foes
would
be
fatal
to
me
it
meant
the
loss
of
the
pure
reputation
i
prized
the
good
name
i
had
guarded
scandal
the
most
terrible
a
woman
could
face
but
i
had
seen
the
misery
of
the
poor
of
my
with
children
crying
for
bread
the
wages
of
the
workmen
were
often
sufficient
for
four
but
eight
or
ten
they
could
not
maintain
should
i
set
my
own
safety
my
own
good
name
against
the
helping
of
these
did
it
matter
that
my
reputation
should
be
ruined
if
its
ruin
helped
to
bring
remedy
to
this
otherwise
hopeless
wretchedness
of
thousands
what
was
worth
all
my
talk
about
and
if
brought
to
the
test
i
failed
so
with
heart
aching
but
steady
i
came
to
my
resolution
and
though
i
know
now
that
i
was
wrong
intellectually
and
blundered
in
the
remedy
i
was
right
morally
in
the
will
to
sacrifice
all
to
help
the
poor
and
i
can
rejoice
that
i
faced
a
storm
of
obloquy
fiercer
and
harder
to
bear
than
any
other
which
can
ever
touch
me
again
i
learned
a
lesson
of
stern
indifference
to
all
judgments
from
without
that
were
not
endorsed
by
condemnation
from
within
the
long
suffering
that
followed
was
a
splendid
school
for
the
teaching
of
endurance
the
day
before
the
pamphlet
was
put
on
sale
we
ourselves
delivered
copies
to
the
chief
clerk
of
the
magistrates
at
guildhall
to
the
officer
in
charge
at
the
city
police
office
in
old
jewry
and
to
the
solicitor
for
the
city
of
london
with
each
pamphlet
was
a
notice
that
we
would
attend
and
sell
the
book
from
to
on
the
following
day
saturday
march
this
we
accordingly
did
and
in
order
to
save
trouble
we
offered
to
attend
daily
at
the
shop
from
to
to
facilitate
our
arrest
should
the
authorities
determine
to
prosecute
the
offer
was
readily
accepted
and
after
some
little
delay
during
which
a
deputation
from
the
christian
evidence
society
waited
upon
cross
to
urge
the
tory
government
to
prosecute
us
warrants
were
issued
against
us
and
we
were
arrested
on
april
letters
of
approval
and
encouragement
came
from
the
most
diverse
quarters
including
among
their
writers
general
garibaldi
the
economist
yves
guyot
the
great
french
constitutional
lawyer
emile
acollas
together
with
letters
literally
by
the
hundred
from
poor
men
and
women
thanking
and
blessing
us
for
the
stand
taken
noticeable
were
the
numbers
of
letters
from
clergymen
wives
and
wives
of
ministers
of
all
denominations
after
our
arrest
we
were
taken
to
the
in
bridewell
place
and
thence
to
the
guildhall
where
alderman
figgins
was
sitting
before
whom
we
duly
appeared
while
in
the
back
of
the
court
waited
what
an
official
described
as
a
regular
of
bail
we
were
quickly
released
the
preliminary
investigation
being
fixed
for
ten
days
later
april
at
the
close
of
the
day
the
magistrate
released
us
on
our
own
recognisances
without
bail
and
it
was
so
fully
seen
on
all
sides
that
we
were
fighting
for
a
principle
that
no
bail
was
asked
for
during
the
various
stages
of
the
trial
two
days
later
we
were
committed
for
trial
at
the
central
criminal
court
but
bradlaugh
moved
for
a
writ
of
to
remove
the
trial
to
the
court
of
queen
bench
lord
chief
justice
cockburn
said
he
would
grant
the
writ
if
upon
looking
at
it
the
book
we
think
its
object
is
the
legitimate
one
of
promoting
knowledge
on
a
matter
of
human
interest
but
not
if
the
science
were
only
a
cover
for
impurity
and
he
directed
that
copies
of
the
book
should
be
handed
in
for
perusal
by
himself
and
justice
mellor
having
read
the
book
they
granted
the
writ
the
trial
commenced
on
june
before
the
lord
chief
justice
of
england
and
a
special
jury
sir
hardinge
giffard
the
of
the
tory
government
leading
against
us
and
we
defending
ourselves
the
lord
chief
justice
summed
up
strongly
for
an
acquittal
as
a
morning
paper
said
he
declared
that
a
more
and
more
injudicious
proceeding
in
the
way
of
a
prosecution
was
probably
never
brought
into
a
court
of
justice
and
described
us
as
two
enthusiasts
who
have
been
actuated
by
a
desire
to
do
good
in
a
particular
department
of
society
he
then
went
on
to
a
splendid
statement
of
the
law
of
population
and
ended
by
praising
our
straightforwardness
and
asserting
knowlton
honesty
of
intention
every
one
in
court
thought
that
we
had
won
our
case
but
they
had
not
taken
into
account
the
religious
and
political
hatred
against
us
and
the
presence
on
the
jury
of
such
men
as
walter
of
the
after
an
hour
and
minutes
of
delay
the
verdict
was
a
compromise
we
are
unanimously
of
opinion
that
the
book
in
question
is
calculated
to
deprave
public
morals
but
at
the
same
time
we
entirely
exonerate
the
defendants
from
any
corrupt
motive
in
publishing
it
the
lord
chief
justice
looked
troubled
and
said
that
he
should
have
to
translate
the
verdict
into
one
of
guilty
and
on
that
some
of
the
jury
turned
to
leave
the
box
it
having
been
agreed
we
heard
later
from
one
of
them
that
if
the
verdict
were
not
accepted
in
that
form
they
should
retire
again
as
six
of
the
jury
were
against
convicting
us
but
the
foreman
who
was
bitterly
hostile
jumped
at
the
chance
of
snatching
a
conviction
and
none
of
those
in
our
favour
had
the
courage
to
contradict
him
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
so
the
foreman
guilty
passed
and
the
judge
set
us
free
on
bradlaugh
recognisances
to
come
up
for
judgment
that
day
week
on
that
day
we
moved
to
quash
the
indictment
and
for
a
new
trial
partly
on
a
technical
ground
and
partly
on
the
ground
that
the
verdict
having
acquitted
us
of
wrong
motive
was
in
our
favour
not
against
us
on
this
the
court
did
not
agree
with
us
holding
that
the
part
of
the
indictment
alleging
corrupt
motive
was
superfluous
then
came
the
question
of
sentence
and
on
this
the
lord
chief
justice
did
his
best
to
save
us
we
were
acquitted
of
any
intent
to
violate
the
law
would
we
submit
to
the
verdict
of
the
jury
and
promise
not
to
sell
the
book
no
we
would
not
we
claimed
the
right
to
sell
and
meant
to
vindicate
it
the
judge
pleaded
argued
finally
got
angry
with
us
and
at
last
compelled
to
pass
sentence
he
stated
that
if
we
would
have
yielded
he
would
have
let
us
go
free
without
penalty
but
that
as
we
would
set
ourselves
against
the
law
break
it
and
defy
it
a
sore
offence
from
the
judge
point
of
view
he
could
only
pass
a
heavy
sentence
on
each
of
six
months
imprisonment
a
fine
of
and
recognisances
of
for
two
years
and
this
as
he
again
repeated
upon
the
assumption
that
they
do
intend
to
set
the
law
at
defiance
even
despite
this
he
made
us
misdemeanants
then
as
bradlaugh
stated
that
we
should
move
for
a
writ
of
error
he
liberated
us
on
bradlaugh
recognisance
for
the
queerest
comment
on
his
view
of
the
case
and
of
our
characters
since
we
were
liable
jointly
to
under
the
sentence
to
say
nothing
of
the
imprisonment
but
prison
and
money
penalties
vanished
into
thin
air
for
the
writ
of
error
was
granted
proved
successful
and
the
verdict
was
quashed
then
ensued
a
somewhat
anxious
time
we
were
resolute
to
continue
selling
were
our
opponents
equally
resolved
to
prosecute
us
we
could
not
tell
i
wrote
a
pamphlet
entitled
the
law
of
population
giving
the
arguments
which
had
convinced
me
of
its
truth
the
terrible
distress
and
degradation
entailed
on
families
by
overcrowding
and
the
lack
of
the
necessaries
of
life
pleading
for
early
marriages
that
prostitution
might
be
destroyed
and
limitation
of
the
family
that
pauperism
might
be
avoided
finally
giving
the
information
which
rendered
early
marriage
without
these
evils
possible
this
pamphlet
was
put
in
circulation
as
representing
our
view
of
the
subject
and
we
again
took
up
the
sale
of
knowlton
bradlaugh
carried
the
war
into
the
enemy
country
and
commenced
an
action
against
the
police
for
the
recovery
of
some
pamphlets
they
had
seized
he
carried
the
action
to
a
successful
issue
recovered
the
pamphlets
bore
them
off
in
triumph
and
we
sold
them
all
with
an
inscription
across
them
recovered
from
the
police
we
continued
the
sale
of
knowlton
tract
for
some
time
until
we
received
an
intimation
that
no
further
prosecution
would
be
attempted
and
on
this
we
at
once
dropped
its
publication
substituting
for
it
my
law
of
population
illustration
charles
bradlaugh
but
the
worst
part
of
the
fight
for
me
was
to
come
prosecution
of
the
law
of
population
was
threatened
but
never
commenced
a
worse
weapon
against
me
was
in
store
an
attempt
had
been
made
in
august
to
deprive
me
of
the
custody
of
my
little
girl
by
hiding
her
away
when
she
went
on
her
annual
visit
of
one
month
to
her
father
but
i
had
promptly
recovered
her
by
threatening
to
issue
a
writ
of
now
it
was
felt
that
the
knowlton
trial
might
be
added
to
the
charges
of
blasphemy
that
could
be
urged
against
me
and
that
this
gun
might
be
discharged
with
effect
i
received
notice
in
january
that
an
application
was
to
be
made
to
the
high
court
of
chancery
to
deprive
me
of
the
child
but
the
petition
was
not
filed
till
the
following
april
mabel
was
dangerously
ill
with
scarlet
fever
at
the
time
and
though
this
fact
was
communicated
to
her
father
i
received
a
copy
of
the
petition
while
sitting
at
her
bedside
the
petition
alleged
that
the
said
annie
besant
is
by
addresses
lectures
and
writings
endeavouring
to
propagate
the
principles
of
atheism
and
has
published
a
book
entitled
gospel
of
atheism
she
has
also
associated
herself
with
an
infidel
lecturer
and
author
named
charles
bradlaugh
in
giving
lectures
and
in
publishing
books
and
pamphlets
whereby
the
truth
of
the
christian
religion
is
impeached
and
disbelief
in
all
religion
inculcated
it
further
alleged
against
me
the
publication
of
the
knowlton
pamphlet
and
the
writing
of
the
law
of
population
unhappily
the
petition
came
for
hearing
before
the
then
master
of
the
rolls
sir
george
jessel
a
man
animated
by
the
old
spirit
of
hebrew
bigotry
to
which
he
had
added
the
morality
of
a
man
of
the
world
sceptical
as
to
all
sincerity
and
contemptuous
of
all
devotion
to
an
unpopular
cause
the
treatment
i
received
at
his
hands
on
my
first
appearance
in
court
told
me
what
i
had
to
expect
i
had
already
had
some
experience
of
english
judges
the
stately
kindness
and
gentleness
of
the
lord
chief
justice
the
perfect
impartiality
and
dignified
courtesy
of
the
lords
justices
of
appeal
my
astonishment
then
can
be
imagined
when
in
answer
to
a
statement
by
ince
that
i
appeared
in
person
i
heard
a
harsh
loud
voice
exclaim
appear
in
person
a
lady
appear
in
person
never
heard
of
such
a
thing
does
the
lady
really
appear
in
person
as
the
london
papers
had
been
full
of
my
appearing
in
person
in
the
other
courts
and
had
contained
the
high
compliments
of
the
lord
chief
justice
on
my
conduct
of
my
own
case
sir
george
jessel
pretended
astonishment
seemed
a
little
overdone
after
a
variety
of
similar
remarks
delivered
in
the
most
grating
tones
and
in
the
roughest
manner
sir
george
jessel
tried
to
obtain
his
object
by
browbeating
me
directly
is
this
the
lady
i
am
the
respondent
my
lord
mrs
besant
then
i
advise
you
besant
to
employ
counsel
to
represent
you
if
you
can
afford
it
and
i
suppose
you
can
with
all
submission
to
your
lordship
i
am
afraid
i
must
claim
my
right
of
arguing
my
case
in
person
you
will
do
so
if
you
please
of
course
but
i
think
you
had
much
better
appear
by
counsel
i
give
you
notice
that
if
you
do
not
you
must
not
expect
to
be
shown
any
consideration
you
will
not
be
heard
by
me
at
any
greater
length
than
the
case
requires
nor
allowed
to
go
into
irrelevant
matter
as
persons
who
argue
their
own
cases
usually
do
i
trust
i
shall
not
do
so
my
lord
but
in
any
case
i
shall
be
arguing
under
your
lordship
complete
control
this
encouraging
beginning
may
be
taken
as
a
sample
of
the
case
it
was
one
long
fight
against
clever
counsel
aided
by
a
counsel
instead
of
a
judge
on
the
bench
only
once
did
judge
and
counsel
fall
out
ince
and
bardswell
had
been
arguing
that
my
atheism
and
malthusianism
made
me
an
unfit
guardian
for
my
child
ince
declared
that
mabel
educated
by
me
would
be
helpless
for
good
in
this
world
and
hopeless
for
good
hereafter
outcast
in
this
life
and
damned
in
the
next
bardswell
implored
the
judge
to
consider
that
my
custody
of
her
would
be
detrimental
to
the
future
prospects
of
the
child
in
society
to
say
nothing
of
her
eternal
prospects
had
not
the
matter
been
to
me
of
such
importance
i
could
have
laughed
at
the
mixture
of
grundy
marriage
establishment
and
hell
presented
as
an
argument
for
robbing
a
mother
of
her
child
but
bardswell
carelessly
forgot
that
sir
george
jessel
was
a
jew
and
lifting
eyes
to
heaven
in
horrified
appeal
he
gasped
out
your
lordship
i
think
will
scarcely
credit
it
but
besant
says
in
a
later
affidavit
that
she
took
away
the
testament
from
the
child
because
it
contained
coarse
passages
unfit
for
a
child
to
read
the
opportunity
was
too
tempting
for
a
jew
to
refrain
from
striking
at
a
book
written
by
apostate
jews
and
sir
george
jessel
answered
sharply
it
is
not
true
to
say
there
are
no
passages
unfit
for
a
reading
because
i
think
there
are
a
great
many
i
do
not
know
of
any
passages
that
could
fairly
be
called
coarse
i
can
not
quite
assent
to
that
barring
this
little
episode
judge
and
counsel
showed
a
charming
unanimity
i
distinctly
said
i
was
an
atheist
that
i
had
withdrawn
the
child
from
religious
instruction
at
the
she
attended
that
i
had
written
various
books
and
so
on
but
i
claimed
the
child
custody
on
the
ground
that
the
deed
of
separation
distinctly
gave
it
to
me
and
had
been
executed
by
her
father
after
i
had
left
the
christian
church
and
that
my
opinions
were
not
sufficient
to
invalidate
it
it
was
admitted
on
the
other
side
that
the
child
was
admirably
cared
for
and
there
was
no
attempt
at
attacking
my
personal
character
the
judge
stated
that
i
had
taken
the
greatest
possible
care
of
the
child
but
decided
that
the
mere
fact
of
my
refusing
to
give
the
child
religious
instruction
was
sufficient
ground
for
depriving
me
of
her
custody
secular
education
he
regarded
as
not
only
reprehensible
but
detestable
and
likely
to
work
utter
ruin
to
the
child
and
i
certainly
should
upon
this
ground
alone
decide
that
this
child
ought
not
to
remain
another
day
under
the
care
of
her
mother
sir
george
jessel
denounced
also
my
malthusian
views
in
a
fashion
at
once
so
brutal
and
so
untruthful
as
to
facts
that
some
years
later
another
judge
the
senior
puisne
judge
of
the
supreme
court
of
new
south
wales
declared
in
a
judgment
delivered
in
his
own
court
that
there
was
no
language
used
by
lord
cockburn
which
justified
the
master
of
the
rolls
in
assuming
that
lord
cockburn
regarded
the
book
as
obscene
and
that
little
weight
is
to
be
attached
to
his
opinion
on
a
point
not
submitted
for
his
decision
he
went
on
to
administer
a
sharp
rebuke
for
the
way
in
which
sir
george
jessel
travelled
outside
the
case
and
remarked
that
abuse
however
of
an
unpopular
opinion
whether
indulged
in
by
judges
or
other
people
is
not
argument
nor
can
the
vituperation
of
opponents
in
opinion
prove
them
to
be
immoral
however
sir
george
jessel
was
in
his
own
court
and
he
deprived
me
of
my
child
refusing
to
stay
the
order
even
until
the
hearing
of
my
appeal
against
his
decision
a
messenger
from
the
father
came
to
my
house
and
the
little
child
was
carried
away
by
main
force
shrieking
and
struggling
still
weak
from
the
fever
and
nearly
frantic
with
fear
and
passionate
resistance
no
access
to
her
was
given
me
and
i
gave
notice
that
if
access
were
denied
me
i
would
sue
for
a
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
merely
that
i
might
see
my
children
but
the
strain
had
been
too
great
and
i
nearly
went
mad
spending
hours
pacing
up
and
down
the
empty
rooms
striving
to
weary
myself
to
exhaustion
that
i
might
forget
the
loneliness
and
silence
of
the
house
of
which
my
darling
had
always
been
the
sunshine
and
the
music
weighed
on
me
like
an
evil
dream
i
listened
for
the
patter
of
the
dancing
feet
and
merry
thrilling
laughter
that
rang
through
the
garden
the
sweet
music
of
the
childish
voice
during
my
sleepless
nights
i
missed
in
the
darkness
the
soft
breathing
of
the
little
child
each
morning
i
longed
in
vain
for
the
clinging
arms
and
soft
sweet
kisses
at
last
health
broke
down
and
fever
struck
me
and
mercifully
gave
me
the
rest
of
pain
and
delirium
instead
of
the
agony
of
conscious
loss
through
that
terrible
illness
day
after
day
bradlaugh
came
to
me
and
sat
writing
beside
me
feeding
me
with
ice
and
milk
refused
from
all
others
and
behaving
more
like
a
tender
mother
than
a
man
friend
he
saved
my
life
though
it
seemed
to
me
for
awhile
of
little
value
till
the
first
months
of
lonely
pain
were
over
when
recovered
i
took
steps
to
set
aside
an
order
obtained
by
besant
during
my
illness
forbidding
me
to
bring
any
suit
against
him
and
even
the
master
of
the
rolls
on
hearing
that
all
access
had
been
denied
to
me
and
the
money
due
to
me
stopped
uttered
words
of
strong
condemnation
of
the
way
in
which
i
had
been
treated
finally
the
deed
of
separation
executed
in
was
held
to
be
good
as
protecting
besant
from
any
suit
brought
by
me
whether
for
divorce
or
for
restitution
of
conjugal
rights
while
the
clauses
giving
me
the
custody
of
the
child
were
set
aside
the
court
of
appeal
in
april
upheld
the
decision
the
absolute
right
of
the
father
as
against
a
married
mother
being
upheld
this
ignoring
of
all
right
to
her
children
on
the
part
of
the
married
mother
is
a
scandal
and
a
wrong
that
has
since
been
redressed
by
parliament
and
the
husband
has
no
longer
in
his
grasp
this
instrument
of
torture
whose
power
to
agonise
depends
on
the
tenderness
and
strength
of
the
motherliness
of
the
wife
in
the
days
when
the
law
took
my
child
from
me
it
virtually
said
to
all
women
choose
which
of
these
two
positions
as
wife
and
mother
you
will
occupy
if
you
are
legally
your
husband
wife
you
can
have
no
legal
claim
to
your
children
if
legally
you
are
your
husband
mistress
your
rights
as
mother
are
secure
that
stigma
on
marriage
is
now
removed
one
thing
i
gained
in
the
court
of
appeal
the
court
expressed
a
strong
view
as
to
my
right
of
access
and
directed
me
to
apply
to
sir
george
jessel
for
it
adding
that
it
could
not
doubt
he
would
grant
it
under
cover
of
this
i
applied
to
the
master
of
the
rolls
and
obtained
liberal
access
to
the
children
but
i
found
that
my
visits
kept
mabel
in
a
continual
state
of
longing
and
fretting
for
me
while
the
ingenious
forms
of
petty
insult
that
were
devised
against
me
and
used
in
the
children
presence
would
soon
become
palpable
to
them
and
cause
continual
pain
so
after
a
painful
struggle
with
myself
i
resolved
to
give
up
the
right
of
seeing
them
feeling
that
thus
only
could
i
save
them
from
constantly
recurring
conflict
destructive
of
all
happiness
and
of
all
respect
for
one
or
the
other
parent
resolutely
i
turned
my
back
on
them
that
i
might
spare
them
trouble
and
determined
that
robbed
of
my
own
i
would
be
a
mother
to
all
helpless
children
i
could
aid
and
cure
the
pain
at
my
own
heart
by
soothing
the
pain
of
others
as
far
as
regards
this
whole
struggle
over
the
knowlton
pamphlet
victory
was
finally
won
all
along
the
line
not
only
did
we
as
related
recover
all
our
seized
pamphlets
and
continue
the
sale
till
all
prosecution
and
threat
of
prosecution
were
definitely
surrendered
but
my
own
tract
had
an
enormous
sale
so
that
when
i
withdrew
it
from
sale
in
june
i
was
offered
a
large
sum
for
the
copyright
an
offer
which
i
of
course
refused
since
that
time
not
a
copy
has
been
sold
with
my
knowledge
or
permission
but
long
ere
that
the
pamphlet
had
received
a
very
complete
legal
vindication
for
while
it
circulated
untouched
in
england
a
prosecution
was
attempted
against
it
in
new
south
wales
but
was
put
an
end
to
by
an
eloquent
and
luminous
judgment
by
the
senior
puisne
judge
of
the
supreme
court
justice
windmeyer
in
december
this
judge
the
most
respected
in
the
great
australian
colony
spoke
out
plainly
and
strongly
on
the
morality
of
such
teaching
take
the
case
he
said
of
a
woman
married
to
a
drunken
husband
steadily
ruining
his
constitution
and
hastening
to
the
drunkard
doom
loss
of
employment
for
himself
for
his
family
and
finally
death
without
a
shilling
to
leave
those
whom
he
has
brought
into
the
world
but
armed
with
the
authority
of
the
law
to
treat
his
wife
as
his
slave
ever
brutally
insisting
on
the
indulgence
of
his
marital
rights
where
is
the
immorality
if
already
broken
in
health
from
unresting
maternity
having
already
a
larger
family
than
she
can
support
when
the
miserable
breadwinner
has
drunk
himself
to
death
the
woman
avails
herself
of
the
information
given
in
this
book
and
so
averts
the
consequences
of
yielding
to
her
husband
brutal
insistence
on
his
marital
rights
already
weighted
with
a
family
that
she
is
unable
to
decently
bring
up
the
immorality
it
seems
to
me
would
be
in
the
reckless
and
criminal
disregard
of
precautions
which
would
prevent
her
bringing
into
the
world
daughters
whose
future
outlook
as
a
career
would
be
prostitution
or
sons
whose
inherited
taint
of
alcoholism
would
soon
drag
them
down
with
their
sisters
to
herd
with
the
seething
mass
of
degenerate
and
criminal
humanity
that
constitutes
the
dangerous
classes
of
great
cities
in
all
these
cases
the
appeal
is
from
thoughtless
unreasoning
prejudice
to
conscience
and
if
listened
to
its
voice
will
be
heard
unmistakably
indicating
where
the
path
of
duty
lies
the
judge
forcibly
refused
to
be
any
party
to
the
prohibition
of
such
a
pamphlet
regarding
it
as
of
high
service
to
the
community
he
said
so
strong
is
the
dread
of
the
world
censure
upon
this
topic
that
few
have
the
courage
openly
to
express
their
views
upon
it
and
its
nature
is
such
that
it
is
only
amongst
thinkers
who
discuss
all
subjects
or
amongst
intimate
acquaintances
that
community
of
thought
upon
the
question
is
discovered
but
let
any
one
inquire
amongst
those
who
have
sufficient
education
and
ability
to
think
for
themselves
and
who
do
not
idly
float
slaves
to
the
current
of
conventional
opinion
and
he
will
discover
that
numbers
of
men
and
women
of
purest
lives
of
noblest
aspirations
pious
cultivated
and
refined
see
no
wrong
in
teaching
the
ignorant
that
it
is
wrong
to
bring
into
the
world
children
to
whom
they
can
not
do
justice
and
who
think
it
folly
to
stop
short
in
telling
them
simply
and
plainly
how
to
prevent
it
a
more
robust
view
of
morals
teaches
that
it
is
puerile
to
ignore
human
passions
and
human
physiology
a
clearer
perception
of
truth
and
the
safety
of
trusting
to
it
teaches
that
in
law
as
in
religion
it
is
useless
trying
to
limit
the
knowledge
of
mankind
by
any
inquisitorial
attempts
to
place
upon
a
judicial
index
expurgatorius
works
written
with
an
earnest
purpose
and
commending
themselves
to
thinkers
of
minds
i
will
be
no
party
to
any
such
attempt
i
do
not
believe
that
it
was
ever
meant
that
the
obscene
publication
act
should
apply
to
cases
of
this
kind
but
only
to
the
publication
of
such
matter
as
all
good
men
would
regard
as
lewd
and
filthy
to
lewd
and
bawdy
novels
pictures
and
exhibitions
evidently
published
and
given
for
lucre
sake
it
could
never
have
been
intended
to
stifle
the
expression
of
thought
by
the
on
a
subject
of
transcendent
national
importance
like
the
present
and
i
will
not
strain
it
for
that
purpose
as
pointed
out
by
lord
cockburn
in
the
case
of
the
queen
bradlaugh
and
besant
all
prosecutions
of
this
kind
should
be
regarded
as
mischievous
even
by
those
who
disapprove
the
opinions
sought
to
be
stifled
inasmuch
as
they
only
tend
more
widely
to
diffuse
the
teaching
objected
to
to
those
on
the
other
hand
who
desire
its
promulgation
it
must
be
a
matter
of
congratulation
that
this
like
all
attempted
persecutions
of
thinkers
will
defeat
its
own
object
and
that
truth
like
a
torch
more
it
shook
it
shines
the
argument
of
justice
windmeyer
for
the
position
was
as
any
one
may
see
who
reads
the
full
text
of
the
judgment
one
of
the
most
luminous
and
cogent
i
have
ever
read
the
judgment
was
spoken
of
at
the
time
in
the
english
press
as
a
brilliant
triumph
for
besant
and
so
i
suppose
it
was
but
no
legal
judgment
could
undo
the
harm
wrought
on
the
public
mind
in
england
by
malignant
and
persistent
misrepresentation
what
that
trial
and
its
results
cost
me
in
pain
no
one
but
myself
will
ever
know
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
passionate
gratitude
evidenced
by
letters
from
thousands
of
poor
married
women
many
from
the
wives
of
country
clergymen
and
curates
thanking
and
blessing
me
for
showing
them
how
to
escape
from
the
veritable
hell
in
which
they
lived
the
upper
classes
of
society
know
nothing
about
the
way
in
which
the
poor
live
how
their
overcrowding
destroys
all
sense
of
personal
dignity
of
modesty
of
outward
decency
till
human
life
as
bishop
fraser
justly
said
is
degraded
below
the
level
of
the
swine
to
such
and
among
such
i
went
and
i
could
not
grudge
the
price
that
then
seemed
to
me
as
the
ransom
for
their
redemption
to
me
indeed
it
meant
the
losing
of
all
that
made
life
dear
but
for
them
it
seemed
to
be
the
gaining
of
all
that
gave
hope
of
a
better
future
so
how
could
i
hesitate
i
whose
heart
had
been
fired
by
devotion
to
an
ideal
humanity
inspired
by
that
materialism
that
is
of
love
and
not
of
hate
and
now
in
august
we
find
the
world
the
representative
organ
of
orthodox
christian
protestantism
proclaiming
the
right
and
the
duty
of
voluntary
limitation
of
the
family
in
a
leading
article
after
a
number
of
letters
had
been
inserted
it
said
the
conditions
are
assuredly
wrong
which
bring
one
member
of
the
married
partnership
into
a
bondage
so
cruel
it
is
no
less
evident
that
the
cause
of
the
bondage
in
such
cases
lies
in
the
too
rapid
multiplication
of
the
family
there
was
a
time
when
any
idea
of
voluntary
limitation
was
regarded
by
pious
people
as
interfering
with
providence
we
are
beyond
that
now
and
have
become
capable
of
recognising
that
providence
works
through
the
common
sense
of
individual
brains
we
limit
population
just
as
much
by
deferring
marriage
from
prudential
motives
as
by
any
action
that
may
be
taken
after
it
apart
from
certain
methods
of
limitation
the
morality
of
which
is
gravely
questioned
by
many
there
are
certain
physiological
laws
of
the
subject
the
failure
to
know
and
to
observe
which
is
inexcusable
on
the
part
either
of
men
or
women
in
these
circumstances
it
is
worth
noting
in
this
connection
that
billings
in
his
article
in
this
month
on
the
diminishing
of
the
united
states
gives
as
one
of
the
reasons
the
greater
diffusion
of
intelligence
by
means
of
popular
and
school
treatises
on
physiology
than
formerly
prevailed
thus
has
opinion
changed
in
sixteen
years
and
all
the
obloquy
poured
on
us
is
seen
to
have
been
the
outcome
of
ignorance
and
bigotry
as
for
the
children
what
was
gained
by
their
separation
from
me
the
moment
they
were
old
enough
to
free
themselves
they
came
back
to
me
my
little
girl
too
brief
stay
with
me
being
ended
by
her
happy
marriage
and
i
fancy
the
fears
expressed
for
her
eternal
future
will
prove
as
groundless
as
the
fears
for
her
temporal
ruin
have
proved
to
be
not
only
so
but
both
are
treading
in
my
steps
as
regards
their
views
of
the
nature
and
destiny
of
man
and
have
joined
in
their
bright
youth
the
theosophical
society
to
which
after
so
many
struggles
i
won
my
way
the
struggle
on
the
right
to
discuss
the
prudential
restraint
of
population
did
not
however
conclude
without
a
martyr
edward
truelove
alluded
to
above
was
prosecuted
for
selling
a
treatise
by
robert
dale
owen
on
moral
physiology
and
a
pamphlet
entitled
individual
family
and
national
poverty
he
was
tried
on
february
before
the
lord
chief
justice
in
the
court
of
queen
bench
and
was
most
ably
defended
by
professor
hunter
the
jury
spent
two
hours
in
considering
their
verdict
and
returned
into
court
and
stated
that
they
were
unable
to
agree
the
majority
of
the
jury
were
ready
to
convict
if
they
felt
sure
that
truelove
would
not
be
punished
but
one
of
them
boldly
declared
in
court
as
to
the
book
it
is
written
in
plain
language
for
plain
people
and
i
think
that
many
more
persons
ought
to
know
what
the
contents
of
the
book
are
the
jury
was
discharged
in
consequence
of
this
one
man
courage
but
truelove
persecutors
the
vice
society
were
determined
not
to
let
their
victim
free
they
proceeded
to
trial
a
second
time
and
wisely
endeavoured
to
secure
a
special
jury
feeling
that
as
prudential
restraint
would
raise
wages
by
limiting
the
supply
of
labour
they
would
be
more
likely
to
obtain
a
verdict
from
a
jury
of
gentlemen
than
from
one
composed
of
workers
this
attempt
was
circumvented
by
truelove
legal
advisers
who
let
a
go
which
sent
back
the
trial
to
the
old
bailey
the
second
trial
was
held
on
may
at
the
central
criminal
court
before
baron
pollock
and
a
common
jury
professor
hunter
and
davidson
appearing
for
the
defence
the
jury
convicted
and
the
brave
old
man
years
of
age
was
condemned
to
four
months
imprisonment
and
fine
for
selling
a
pamphlet
which
had
been
sold
unchallenged
during
a
period
of
years
by
james
watson
george
jacob
holyoake
austin
holyoake
and
charles
watts
mr
grain
the
counsel
employed
by
the
vice
society
most
unfairly
used
against
truelove
my
law
of
population
a
pamphlet
which
contained
baron
pollock
said
the
head
and
front
of
the
offence
in
the
other
the
knowlton
case
i
find
an
indignant
protest
against
this
odious
unfairness
in
the
for
may
my
of
population
was
used
against
truelove
as
an
aggravation
of
his
offence
passing
over
the
utter
meanness
worthy
only
of
collette
of
using
against
a
prisoner
a
book
whose
author
has
never
been
attacked
for
writing
it
does
collette
or
do
the
authorities
imagine
that
the
severity
shown
to
truelove
will
in
any
fashion
deter
me
from
continuing
the
malthusian
propaganda
let
me
here
assure
them
one
and
all
that
it
will
do
nothing
of
the
kind
i
shall
continue
to
sell
the
of
population
and
to
advocate
scientific
checks
to
population
just
as
though
collette
and
his
vice
society
were
all
dead
and
buried
in
commonest
justice
they
are
bound
to
prosecute
me
and
if
they
get
and
keep
a
verdict
against
me
and
succeed
in
sending
me
to
prison
they
will
only
make
people
more
anxious
to
read
my
book
and
make
me
more
personally
powerful
as
a
teacher
of
the
views
which
they
attack
a
persistent
attempt
was
made
to
obtain
a
writ
of
error
in
truelove
case
but
the
tory
sir
john
holker
refused
it
although
the
ground
on
which
it
was
asked
was
one
of
the
grounds
on
which
a
similar
writ
had
been
granted
to
bradlaugh
and
myself
truelove
was
therefore
compelled
to
suffer
his
sentence
but
memorials
signed
by
persons
asking
for
his
release
were
sent
to
the
home
secretary
from
every
part
of
the
country
and
a
crowded
meeting
in
james
hall
london
demanded
his
liberation
with
only
six
dissentients
the
whole
agitation
did
not
shorten
truelove
sentence
by
a
single
day
and
he
was
not
released
from
coldbath
fields
prison
until
september
on
the
of
the
same
month
the
hall
of
science
was
crowded
with
enthusiastic
friends
who
assembled
to
do
him
honour
and
he
was
presented
with
a
address
and
a
purse
containing
subsequent
subscriptions
raised
the
amount
to
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
say
that
one
of
the
results
of
the
prosecution
was
a
great
agitation
throughout
the
country
and
a
wide
popularisation
of
malthusian
views
some
huge
demonstrations
were
held
in
favour
of
free
discussion
on
one
occasion
the
free
trade
hall
manchester
was
crowded
to
the
doors
on
another
the
star
music
hall
bradford
was
crammed
in
every
corner
on
another
the
town
hall
birmingham
had
not
a
seat
or
a
bit
of
unoccupied
wherever
we
went
separately
or
together
it
was
the
same
story
and
not
only
were
malthusian
lectures
eagerly
attended
and
malthusian
literature
eagerly
bought
but
curiosity
brought
many
to
listen
to
our
radical
and
freethought
lectures
and
thousands
heard
for
the
first
time
what
secularism
really
meant
the
press
both
london
and
provincial
agreed
in
branding
the
prosecution
as
foolish
and
it
was
generally
remarked
that
it
resulted
only
in
the
wider
circulation
of
the
indicted
book
and
the
increased
popularity
of
those
who
had
stood
for
the
right
of
publication
the
furious
attacks
since
made
upon
us
have
been
made
chiefly
by
those
who
differ
from
us
in
theological
creed
and
who
have
found
a
misrepresentation
of
our
prosecution
served
them
as
a
convenient
weapon
of
attack
during
the
last
few
years
public
opinion
has
been
gradually
coming
round
to
our
side
in
consequence
of
the
pressure
of
poverty
resulting
from
widespread
depression
of
trade
and
during
the
sensation
caused
in
by
the
bitter
cry
of
outcast
london
many
writers
in
the
notably
sims
boldly
alleged
that
the
distress
was
to
a
great
extent
due
to
the
large
families
of
the
poor
and
mentioned
that
we
had
been
prosecuted
for
giving
the
very
knowledge
which
would
bring
salvation
to
the
sufferers
in
our
great
cities
among
the
useful
results
of
the
prosecution
was
the
establishment
of
the
malthusian
league
to
agitate
for
the
abolition
of
all
penalties
on
the
public
discussion
of
the
population
question
and
to
spread
among
the
people
by
all
practicable
means
a
knowledge
of
the
law
of
population
of
its
consequences
and
of
its
bearing
upon
human
conduct
and
morals
the
first
general
meeting
of
the
league
was
held
at
the
hall
of
science
on
july
and
a
council
of
twenty
persons
was
elected
and
this
council
on
august
elected
drysdale
president
swaagman
treasurer
besant
secretary
shearer
and
hember
financial
secretary
since
the
league
under
the
same
indefatigable
president
has
worked
hard
to
carry
out
its
objects
it
has
issued
a
large
number
of
leaflets
and
tracts
it
supports
a
monthly
journal
the
numerous
lectures
have
been
delivered
under
its
auspices
in
all
parts
of
the
country
and
it
has
now
a
medical
branch
into
which
none
but
duly
qualified
medical
men
and
women
are
admitted
with
members
in
all
european
countries
another
result
of
the
prosecution
was
the
accession
of
to
the
staff
of
the
this
able
and
thoughtful
writer
came
forward
and
joined
our
ranks
as
soon
as
he
heard
of
the
attack
on
us
and
he
further
volunteered
to
conduct
the
journal
during
our
expected
imprisonment
from
that
time
to
this
a
period
of
fifteen
years
articles
from
his
pen
appeared
in
its
columns
week
by
week
and
during
all
that
time
not
one
solitary
difficulty
arose
between
editors
and
contributor
in
public
a
trustworthy
colleague
in
private
a
warm
and
sincere
friend
proved
an
unmixed
benefit
bestowed
upon
us
by
the
prosecution
nor
was
the
only
friend
brought
to
us
by
our
foes
i
can
not
ever
think
of
that
time
without
remembering
that
the
prosecution
brought
me
first
into
close
intimacy
with
annie
parris
the
wife
of
touzeau
parris
the
secretary
of
the
defence
committee
throughout
all
the
fight
a
lady
who
during
that
long
struggle
and
during
the
for
me
far
worse
struggle
that
succeeded
it
over
the
custody
of
my
daughter
proved
to
me
the
most
loving
and
sisterly
of
friends
one
or
two
other
friendships
which
will
i
hope
last
my
life
date
from
that
same
time
of
strife
and
anxiety
the
amount
of
money
subscribed
by
the
public
during
the
knowlton
and
succeeding
prosecutions
gives
some
idea
of
the
interest
felt
in
the
struggle
the
defence
fund
committee
in
march
presented
a
showing
subscriptions
amounting
to
and
total
expenditure
in
the
queen
bradlaugh
and
besant
the
queen
truelove
and
the
appeal
against
vaughan
order
the
last
two
up
to
date
of
this
account
was
then
closed
and
the
balance
of
passed
on
to
a
new
fund
for
the
defence
of
truelove
the
carrying
on
of
the
appeal
against
the
destruction
of
the
knowlton
pamphlet
and
the
bearing
of
the
costs
incident
on
the
petition
lodged
against
myself
in
july
this
new
fund
had
reached
and
after
paying
the
remainder
of
the
costs
in
truelove
case
a
balance
of
was
carried
on
this
again
rose
to
and
the
fund
bore
the
expenses
of
bradlaugh
successful
appeal
on
the
knowlton
pamphlet
the
petition
and
subsequent
proceedings
in
which
i
was
concerned
in
the
court
of
chancery
and
an
appeal
on
truelove
behalf
unfortunately
unsuccessful
against
an
order
for
the
destruction
of
the
dale
owen
pamphlet
this
last
decision
was
given
on
february
and
on
this
the
defence
fund
was
closed
on
truelove
release
as
mentioned
above
a
testimonial
to
the
amount
of
was
presented
to
him
and
after
the
close
of
the
struggle
some
anonymous
friend
sent
to
me
personally
as
thanks
for
the
courage
and
ability
shown
in
addition
to
all
this
the
malthusian
league
received
no
less
than
during
the
first
year
of
its
life
and
started
on
its
second
year
with
a
balance
in
hand
of
a
somewhat
similar
prosecution
in
america
in
which
the
bookseller
bennett
sold
a
book
with
which
he
did
not
agree
and
was
imprisoned
led
to
our
giving
him
a
warm
welcome
when
after
his
release
he
visited
england
we
entertained
him
at
the
hall
of
science
at
a
crowded
gathering
and
i
was
deputed
as
spokesman
to
present
him
with
a
testimonial
this
i
did
in
the
following
speech
quoted
here
in
order
to
show
the
spirit
then
animating
me
friends
bradlaugh
has
spoken
of
the
duty
that
calls
us
here
it
is
pleasant
to
think
that
in
our
work
that
duty
is
one
to
which
we
are
not
unaccustomed
in
our
army
there
are
more
true
soldiers
than
traitors
more
that
are
faithful
to
the
trust
of
keeping
the
truth
than
those
who
shrink
when
the
hour
of
danger
comes
and
i
would
ask
bennett
not
to
measure
english
feeling
towards
him
by
the
mere
number
of
those
present
they
that
are
here
are
representatives
of
many
thousands
of
our
glance
down
this
middle
table
and
you
will
see
that
it
is
not
without
some
right
that
we
claim
to
welcome
you
in
the
name
of
multitudes
of
the
citizens
of
england
there
are
those
who
taunt
us
with
want
of
loyalty
and
with
the
name
of
infidels
in
what
church
will
they
find
men
and
women
more
loyal
to
truth
and
conscience
the
name
infidel
is
not
for
us
so
long
as
we
are
faithful
to
the
truth
we
know
if
i
speak
as
i
have
done
of
national
representation
in
this
hall
this
evening
tell
me
you
who
know
those
who
sit
here
who
have
watched
some
of
them
for
years
others
of
them
but
for
a
brief
time
do
i
not
speak
truth
take
them
one
by
one
your
president
but
a
little
while
ago
in
circumstances
similar
to
those
wherein
our
guest
himself
was
placed
with
the
true
lover
keenness
that
recognises
the
mistress
under
all
disguise
beholding
his
mistress
liberty
in
danger
under
circumstances
that
would
have
blinded
less
sure
eyes
leapt
to
her
rescue
he
risked
the
ambition
of
his
life
rather
than
be
disloyal
to
liberty
and
next
is
seated
a
woman
who
student
of
a
noble
profession
thought
that
liberty
had
greater
claim
upon
her
than
even
her
work
when
we
stood
in
worse
peril
than
even
loss
of
liberty
she
risked
her
own
good
name
for
the
truth
sake
one
also
is
here
who
eminent
in
his
own
profession
came
with
the
weight
of
his
position
and
his
right
to
speak
and
gave
a
kindred
testimony
one
step
further
and
you
see
one
who
soldier
to
liberty
throughout
a
long
and
spotless
life
when
the
task
was
far
harder
than
it
is
when
there
were
no
greetings
no
welcomes
when
to
serve
was
to
peril
name
as
well
as
liberty
never
flinched
from
the
first
until
now
he
is
crowned
with
the
glory
of
the
jail
that
was
his
for
no
crime
but
for
claiming
the
right
to
publish
that
wherein
the
noblest
thought
is
uttered
in
the
bravest
words
and
next
to
him
is
another
who
speaks
for
liberty
who
has
brought
culture
university
degree
position
in
men
sight
and
many
friends
and
cast
them
all
at
her
beloved
feet
sir
not
alone
the
past
and
the
present
greet
you
the
future
also
greets
you
with
us
we
have
here
also
those
who
are
training
themselves
to
walk
in
the
footsteps
of
the
one
most
dear
to
them
who
shall
carry
on
when
we
have
passed
away
the
work
which
we
shall
have
dropped
from
our
hands
but
he
whom
we
delight
to
honour
at
this
hour
in
truth
honours
us
in
that
he
allows
us
to
offer
him
the
welcome
that
it
is
our
glory
and
our
pleasure
to
give
he
has
fought
bravely
the
christian
creed
had
in
its
beginning
more
traitors
and
less
true
hearts
than
the
creed
of
we
are
happy
not
only
in
the
thought
of
what
manner
of
men
we
have
for
leaders
but
in
the
thought
of
what
manner
of
men
we
have
as
soldiers
in
our
army
jesus
had
twelve
apostles
one
betrayed
him
for
thirty
pieces
of
silver
a
second
denied
him
they
all
forsook
him
and
fled
we
can
scarcely
point
to
one
who
has
thus
deserted
our
sacred
cause
the
traditions
of
our
party
tell
us
of
many
who
went
to
jail
because
they
claimed
for
all
that
right
of
free
speech
which
is
the
heritage
of
all
one
of
the
most
famous
members
of
our
body
in
england
richard
carlile
turned
bookseller
to
sell
books
that
were
prosecuted
this
man
became
driven
thereto
by
the
bigotry
and
wickedness
of
the
churches
he
sold
the
books
of
hone
not
because
he
agreed
with
them
but
because
hone
was
prosecuted
he
saw
that
the
book
in
whose
prosecution
freedom
was
attacked
was
the
book
for
the
freeman
to

and
the
story
of
our
guest
shows
that
in
all
this
england
and
america
are
one
those
who
gave
milton
to
the
world
can
yet
bring
forth
men
of
the
same
stamp
in
continents
leagues
asunder
because
our
friend
was
loyal
and
true
prison
had
to
him
no
dread
it
was
far
far
less
of
dishonour
to
wear
the
garb
of
the
convict
than
to
wear
that
of
the
hypocrite
the
society
we
represent
like
his
society
in
america
pleads
for
free
thought
speaks
for
free
speech
claims
for
every
one
however
antagonistic
the
right
to
speak
the
thought
he
feels
it
is
better
that
this
should
be
even
though
the
thought
be
wrong
for
thus
the
sooner
will
its
error
be
discovered
better
if
the
thought
be
right
for
then
the
sooner
does
the
gladness
of
a
new
truth
find
place
in
the
heart
of
man
as
the
mouthpiece
sir
of
our
national
secular
society
and
of
its
thousands
of
members
i
speak
to
you
now
seek
for
bennett
asking
you
to
accept
at
the
hands
of
the
national
secular
society
of
england
this
symbol
of
cordial
sympathy
and
brotherly
welcome
we
are
but
putting
into
act
the
motto
of
our
society
we
seek
for
truth
is
our
badge
and
it
is
as
truthseeker
that
we
do
you
homage
without
free
speech
no
search
for
truth
is
possible
without
free
speech
no
discovery
of
truth
is
useful
without
free
speech
progress
is
checked
and
the
nations
no
longer
march
forward
towards
the
nobler
life
which
the
future
holds
for
man
better
a
thousandfold
abuse
of
free
speech
than
denial
of
free
speech
the
abuse
dies
in
a
day
the
denial
slays
the
life
of
the
people
and
entombs
the
hope
of
the
race
your
own
country
you
have
pleaded
for
free
speech
and
when
under
a
wicked
and
an
odious
law
one
of
your
was
imprisoned
for
the
publication
of
his
opinions
you
not
sharing
the
opinions
but
faithful
to
liberty
sprang
forward
to
defend
in
him
the
principle
of
free
speech
which
you
claimed
for
yourself
and
sold
his
book
while
he
lay
in
prison
for
this
act
you
were
in
turn
arrested
and
sent
to
jail
and
the
country
which
won
its
freedom
by
the
aid
of
paine
in
the
eighteenth
century
disgraced
itself
in
the
nineteenth
by
the
imprisonment
of
a
heretic
the
republic
of
the
united
states
dishonoured
herself
and
not
you
in
albany
penitentiary
two
hundred
thousand
of
your
countrymen
pleaded
for
your
release
but
bigotry
was
too
strong
we
sent
you
greeting
in
your
captivity
we
rejoiced
when
the
time
came
for
your
release
we
offer
you
our
thanks
and
our
hope
thanks
for
the
heroism
which
never
flinched
in
the
hour
of
battle
hope
for
a
more
peaceful
future
in
which
the
memory
of
a
past
pain
may
be
a
sacred
heritage
and
not
a
regret
bradlaugh
soldier
of
liberty
we
give
you
this
do
in
the
future
the
same
good
service
that
you
have
done
in
the
past
and
your
reward
shall
be
in
the
love
that
true
men
shall
bear
to
you
that
however
which
no
force
could
compel
me
to
do
which
i
refused
to
threats
of
fine
and
prison
to
separation
from
my
children
to
social
ostracism
and
to
insults
and
ignominy
worse
to
bear
than
death
i
surrendered
freely
when
all
the
struggle
was
over
and
a
great
part
of
society
and
of
public
opinion
had
adopted
the
view
that
cost
bradlaugh
and
myself
so
dear
i
may
as
well
complete
the
story
here
so
as
not
to
have
to
refer
to
it
again
i
gave
up
in
april
its
renunciation
being
part
of
the
outcome
of
two
years
instruction
from
mdme
blavatsky
who
showed
me
that
however
justifiable
might
be
while
man
was
regarded
only
as
the
most
perfect
outcome
of
physical
evolution
it
was
wholly
incompatible
with
the
view
of
man
as
a
spiritual
being
whose
material
form
and
environment
were
the
results
of
his
own
mental
activity
why
and
how
i
embraced
theosophy
and
accepted
blavatsky
as
teacher
will
soon
be
told
in
its
proper
place
here
i
am
concerned
only
with
the
why
and
how
of
my
renunciation
of
the
teaching
for
which
i
had
fought
so
hard
and
suffered
so
much
when
i
built
my
life
on
the
basis
of
materialism
i
judged
all
actions
by
their
effect
on
human
happiness
in
this
world
now
and
in
future
generations
regarding
man
as
an
organism
that
lived
on
earth
and
there
perished
with
activities
confined
to
earth
and
limited
by
physical
laws
the
object
of
life
was
the
ultimate
of
a
physically
mentally
morally
perfect
man
by
the
cumulative
effects
of
heredity
mental
and
moral
tendencies
being
regarded
as
the
outcome
of
material
conditions
to
be
slowly
but
surely
evolved
by
rational
selection
and
the
transmission
to
offspring
of
qualities
carefully
acquired
by
and
developed
in
parents
the
most
characteristic
note
of
this
serious
and
lofty
materialism
had
been
struck
by
professor
clifford
in
his
noble
article
on
the
ethics
of
belief
taking
this
view
of
human
duty
in
regard
to
the
rational
with
nature
in
the
evolution
of
the
human
race
it
became
of
the
first
importance
to
rescue
the
control
of
the
generation
of
offspring
from
mere
blind
brute
passion
and
to
transfer
it
to
the
reason
and
to
the
intelligence
to
impress
on
parents
the
sacredness
of
the
parental
office
the
tremendous
responsibility
of
the
exercise
of
the
creative
function
and
since
further
one
of
the
most
pressing
problems
for
solution
in
the
older
countries
is
that
of
poverty
the
horrible
slums
and
dens
into
which
are
crowded
and
in
which
are
festering
families
of
eight
and
ten
children
whose
parents
are
earning
an
uncertain
and
a
week
since
an
immediate
palliative
is
wanted
if
popular
risings
impelled
by
starvation
are
to
be
avoided
since
the
lives
of
men
and
women
of
the
poorer
classes
and
of
the
worst
paid
professional
classes
are
one
long
struggle
to
make
both
ends
meet
and
keep
respectable
since
in
the
middle
class
marriage
is
often
avoided
or
delayed
till
late
in
life
from
the
dread
of
the
large
family
and
late
marriage
is
followed
by
its
shadow
the
prevalence
of
vice
and
the
moral
and
social
ruin
of
thousands
of
women
for
these
and
many
other
reasons
the
teaching
of
the
duty
of
limiting
the
family
within
the
means
of
subsistence
is
the
logical
outcome
of
materialism
linked
with
the
scientific
view
of
evolution
and
with
a
knowledge
of
the
physical
law
by
which
evolution
is
accelerated
or
retarded
seeking
to
improve
the
physical
type
scientific
materialism
it
seemed
to
me
must
forbid
parentage
to
any
but
healthy
married
couples
it
must
restrict
childbearing
within
the
limits
consistent
with
the
thorough
health
and
physical
of
the
mother
it
must
impose
it
as
a
duty
never
to
bring
children
into
the
world
unless
the
conditions
for
their
fair
nurture
and
development
are
present
regarding
it
as
hopeless
as
well
as
mischievous
to
preach
asceticism
and
looking
on
the
conjunction
of
nominal
celibacy
with
widespread
prostitution
as
inevitable
from
the
constitution
of
human
nature
scientific
materialism
quite
rationally
and
logically
advises
deliberate
restriction
of
the
production
of
offspring
while
sanctioning
the
exercise
of
the
sexual
instinct
within
the
limits
imposed
by
temperance
the
highest
physical
and
mental
efficiency
the
good
order
and
dignity
of
society
and
the
of
the
individual
in
all
this
there
is
nothing
which
for
one
moment
implies
approval
of
licentiousness
profligacy
unbridled
on
the
contrary
it
is
a
and
scheme
of
human
evolution
regarding
all
natural
instincts
as
matters
for
regulation
not
for
destruction
and
seeking
to
develop
the
perfectly
healthy
and
physical
body
as
the
necessary
basis
for
the
healthy
and
mind
if
the
premises
of
materialism
be
true
there
is
no
answer
to
the
conclusions
for
even
those
socialists
who
have
bitterly
opposed
the
promulgation
of
regarding
it
as
a
red
herring
intended
to
draw
the
attention
of
the
proletariat
away
from
the
real
cause
of
poverty
the
monopoly
of
land
and
capital
by
a
class
admit
that
when
society
is
built
on
the
foundation
of
common
property
in
all
that
is
necessary
for
the
production
of
wealth
the
time
will
come
for
the
consideration
of
the
population
question
nor
do
i
now
see
any
more
than
i
saw
then
how
any
materialist
can
rationally
avoid
the
position
for
if
man
be
the
outcome
of
purely
physical
causes
it
is
with
these
that
we
must
deal
in
guiding
his
future
evolution
if
he
be
related
but
to
terrestrial
existence
he
is
but
the
loftiest
organism
of
earth
and
failing
to
see
his
past
and
his
future
how
should
my
eyes
not
have
been
then
blinded
to
the
causes
of
his
present
woe
i
brought
a
material
cure
to
a
disease
which
appeared
to
me
to
be
of
material
origin
but
how
when
the
evil
came
from
a
subtler
source
and
its
causes
lay
not
on
the
material
plane
how
if
the
remedy
only
set
up
new
causes
for
a
future
evil
and
while
immediately
a
palliative
strengthened
the
disease
itself
and
ensured
its
reappearance
in
the
future
this
was
the
view
of
the
problem
set
before
me
by
blavatsky
when
she
unrolled
the
story
of
man
told
of
his
origin
and
his
destiny
showed
me
the
forces
that
went
to
the
making
of
man
and
the
true
relation
between
his
past
his
present
and
his
future
for
what
is
man
in
the
light
of
theosophy
he
is
a
spiritual
intelligence
eternal
and
uncreate
treading
a
vast
cycle
of
human
experience
born
and
reborn
on
earth
millennium
after
millennium
evolving
slowly
into
the
ideal
man
he
is
not
the
product
of
matter
but
is
encased
in
matter
and
the
forms
of
matter
with
which
he
clothes
himself
are
of
his
own
making
for
the
intelligence
and
will
of
man
are
creative
forces
not
creative
but
creative
as
is
the
brain
of
the
painter
and
these
forces
are
exercised
by
man
in
every
act
of
thought
thus
he
is
ever
creating
round
him
moulding
subtlest
matter
into
shape
by
these
energies
forms
which
persist
as
tangible
realities
when
the
body
of
the
thinker
has
long
gone
back
to
earth
and
air
and
water
when
the
time
for
rebirth
into
this
comes
for
the
soul
these
its
own
progeny
help
to
form
the
tenuous
model
into
which
the
molecules
of
physical
matter
are
builded
for
the
making
of
the
body
and
matter
is
thus
moulded
for
the
new
body
in
which
the
soul
is
to
dwell
on
the
lines
laid
down
by
the
intelligent
and
volitional
life
of
the
previous
or
of
many
previous
incarnations
so
does
each
man
create
for
himself
in
verity
the
form
wherein
he
functions
and
what
he
is
in
his
present
is
the
inevitable
outcome
of
his
own
creative
energies
in
his
past
applying
this
to
the
theory
we
see
in
sexual
love
not
only
a
passion
which
man
has
in
common
with
the
brute
and
which
forms
at
the
present
stage
of
evolution
a
necessary
part
of
human
nature
but
an
animal
passion
that
may
be
trained
and
purified
into
a
human
emotion
which
may
be
used
as
one
of
the
levers
in
human
progress
one
of
the
factors
in
human
growth
but
instead
of
this
man
in
the
past
has
made
his
intellect
the
servant
of
his
passions
the
abnormal
development
of
the
sexual
instinct
in
man
in
whom
it
is
far
greater
and
more
continuous
than
in
any
brute
is
due
to
the
mingling
with
it
of
the
intellectual
element
all
sexual
thoughts
desires
and
imaginations
having
created
which
have
been
wrought
into
the
human
race
giving
rise
to
a
continual
demand
far
beyond
nature
and
in
marked
contrast
with
the
temperance
of
normal
animal
life
hence
it
has
become
one
of
the
most
fruitful
sources
of
human
misery
and
human
degradation
and
the
satisfaction
of
its
imperious
cravings
in
civilised
countries
lies
at
the
root
of
our
worst
social
evils
this
excessive
development
has
to
be
fought
against
and
the
instinct
reduced
within
natural
limits
and
this
will
certainly
never
be
done
by
within
the
marital
relation
any
more
than
by
outside
it
by
none
other
road
than
that
of
and
can
men
and
women
now
set
going
the
causes
which
will
build
for
them
brains
and
bodies
of
a
higher
type
for
their
future
return
to
they
have
to
hold
this
instinct
in
complete
control
to
transmute
it
from
passion
into
tender
and
affection
to
develop
the
intellectual
at
the
expense
of
the
animal
and
thus
to
raise
the
whole
man
to
the
human
stage
in
which
every
intellectual
and
physical
capacity
shall
subserve
the
purposes
of
the
soul
from
all
this
it
follows
that
theosophists
should
sound
the
note
of
within
marriage
and
the
gradual
for
with
the
mass
it
can
not
be
sudden
restriction
of
the
sexual
relation
to
the
perpetuation
of
the
race
such
was
the
bearing
of
theosophical
teaching
on
as
laid
before
me
by
blavatsky
and
when
i
urged
out
of
my
bitter
knowledge
of
the
miseries
endured
by
the
poor
that
it
surely
might
for
a
time
at
least
be
recommended
as
a
palliative
as
a
defence
in
the
hands
of
a
woman
against
intolerable
oppression
and
enforced
suffering
she
bade
me
look
beyond
the
moment
and
see
how
the
suffering
must
come
back
and
back
with
every
generation
unless
we
sought
to
remove
the
roots
of
wrong
i
do
not
judge
a
woman
she
said
who
has
resort
to
such
means
of
defence
in
the
midst
of
circumstances
so
evil
and
whose
ignorance
of
the
real
causes
of
all
this
misery
is
her
excuse
for
snatching
at
any
relief
but
it
is
not
for
you
an
occultist
to
continue
to
teach
a
method
which
you
now
know
must
tend
to
the
perpetuation
of
the
sorrow
i
felt
that
she
was
right
and
though
i
shrank
from
the
decision
for
my
heart
somewhat
failed
me
at
withdrawing
from
the
knowledge
of
the
poor
so
far
as
i
could
a
temporary
palliative
of
evils
which
too
often
wreck
their
lives
and
bring
many
to
an
early
grave
worn
old
before
even
middle
age
has
touched
them
yet
the
decision
was
made
i
refused
to
reprint
the
law
of
population
or
to
sell
the
copyright
giving
pain
as
i
sadly
knew
to
all
the
brave
and
loyal
friends
who
had
so
generously
stood
by
me
in
that
long
and
bitter
struggle
and
who
saw
the
results
of
victory
thrown
away
on
grounds
to
them
inadequate
and
mistaken
will
it
always
be
i
wonder
in
man
climbing
upward
that
every
step
must
be
set
on
his
own
heart
and
on
the
hearts
of
those
he
loves
chapter
x
at
war
all
round
coming
back
to
my
work
after
my
long
and
dangerous
illness
i
took
up
again
its
thread
heartsick
but
with
courage
unshaken
and
i
find
myself
in
the
for
september
saying
in
a
brief
note
of
thanks
that
neither
the
illness
nor
the
trouble
which
produced
it
has
in
any
fashion
lessened
my
determination
to
work
for
the
cause
in
truth
i
plunged
into
work
with
added
vigour
for
only
in
that
did
i
find
any
solace
but
the
pamphlets
written
at
this
time
against
christianity
were
marked
with
considerable
bitterness
for
it
was
christianity
that
had
robbed
me
of
my
child
and
i
struck
mercilessly
at
it
in
return
in
the
political
struggles
of
that
time
when
the
beaconsfield
government
was
in
full
swing
with
its
policy
of
annexation
and
aggression
i
played
my
part
with
tongue
and
pen
and
my
articles
in
defence
of
an
honest
and
policy
in
india
against
the
invasion
of
afghanistan
and
other
outrages
laid
in
many
an
indian
heart
a
foundation
of
affection
for
me
and
seem
to
me
now
as
a
preparation
for
the
work
among
indians
to
which
much
of
my
time
and
thought
are
given
in
november
of
this
same
year
i
wrote
a
little
book
on
england
india
and
afghanistan
that
has
brought
me
many
a
warm
letter
of
thanks
and
with
this
the
carrying
on
of
the
suit
against
besant
before
alluded
to
two
and
often
three
lectures
every
sunday
to
say
nothing
of
the
editorial
work
on
the
the
secretarial
work
on
the
malthusian
league
and
stray
lectures
during
the
week
my
time
was
fairly
well
filled
but
i
found
that
in
my
reading
i
developed
a
tendency
to
let
my
thoughts
wander
from
the
subject
in
hand
and
that
they
would
drift
after
my
lost
little
one
so
i
resolved
to
fill
up
the
gaps
in
my
scientific
education
and
to
amuse
myself
by
reading
up
for
some
examinations
i
thought
it
would
serve
as
an
absorbing
form
of
recreation
from
my
other
work
and
would
at
the
same
time
by
making
my
knowledge
exact
render
me
more
useful
as
a
speaker
on
behalf
of
the
causes
to
which
my
life
was
given
at
the
opening
of
the
new
year
i
met
for
the
first
time
a
man
to
whom
i
subsequently
owed
much
in
this
department
of
work
edward
aveling
a
of
london
university
and
a
marvellously
able
teacher
of
scientific
subjects
the
very
ablest
in
fact
that
i
have
ever
met
clear
and
accurate
in
his
knowledge
with
a
singular
gift
for
lucid
exposition
enthusiastic
in
his
love
of
science
and
taking
vivid
pleasure
in
imparting
his
knowledge
to
others
he
was
an
ideal
teacher
this
young
man
in
january
began
writing
under
initials
for
the
and
in
february
i
became
his
pupil
with
the
view
of
matriculating
in
june
at
the
london
university
an
object
which
was
duly
accomplished
and
here
let
me
say
to
any
one
in
mental
trouble
that
they
might
find
an
immense
relief
in
taking
up
some
intellectual
recreation
of
this
kind
during
that
spring
in
addition
to
my
ordinary
work
of
writing
lecturing
and
editing
and
the
lecturing
meant
travelling
from
one
end
of
england
to
the
other
i
translated
a
french
volume
and
had
the
of
pleading
my
case
for
the
custody
of
my
daughter
in
the
court
of
appeal
as
well
as
the
case
before
the
master
of
the
rolls
and
i
found
it
the
very
greatest
relief
to
turn
to
algebra
geometry
and
physics
and
forget
the
harassing
legal
struggles
in
wrestling
with
formulae
and
problems
the
full
access
i
gained
to
my
children
marked
a
step
in
the
long
battle
of
freethinkers
against
disabilities
for
as
noted
in
the
by
bradlaugh
it
was
won
with
a
pleading
unequalled
in
any
case
on
record
for
the
boldness
of
its
affirmation
of
freethought
a
pleading
of
which
he
generously
said
that
it
deserved
well
of
the
party
as
the
most
powerful
pleading
for
freedom
of
opinion
to
which
it
has
ever
been
our
good
fortune
to
listen
in
the
london
some
powerful
letters
of
protest
appeared
one
from
lord
harberton
in
which
he
declared
that
the
inquisition
acted
on
no
other
principle
than
that
applied
to
me
and
a
second
from
mr
band
in
which
he
sarcastically
observed
that
this
christian
community
has
for
some
time
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
her
courts
repeatedly
springing
engines
of
torture
upon
a
young
mother
a
clergyman
wife
who
dared
to
disagree
with
his
creed
and
her
evident
anguish
her
long
and
expensive
struggles
to
save
her
child
have
proved
that
so
far
as
heretical
mothers
are
concerned
modern
defenders
of
the
faith
need
not
envy
the
past
those
persuasive
instruments
which
so
long
secured
the
unity
of
the
church
in
making
besant
an
example
the
master
of
the
rolls
and
lord
justice
james
have
been
careful
not
to
allow
any
of
the
effect
to
be
lost
by
confusion
of
the
main
point
the
intellectual
heresy
with
side
questions
there
was
a
malthusian
matter
in
the
case
but
the
judges
were
very
clear
in
stating
that
without
any
reference
whatever
to
that
they
would
simply
on
the
ground
of
besant
or
opinions
take
her
child
from
her
the
great
provincial
papers
took
a
similar
tone
the
going
so
far
as
to
say
of
the
ruling
of
the
judges
we
do
not
say
they
have
done
so
wrongly
we
only
say
that
the
effect
of
their
judgment
is
cruel
and
it
shows
that
the
holding
of
unpopular
opinions
is
in
the
eye
of
the
law
an
offence
which
despite
all
we
had
thought
to
the
contrary
may
be
visited
with
the
severest
punishment
a
woman
and
a
mother
can
be
possibly
called
on
to
bear
the
outcome
of
all
this
long
struggle
and
of
another
case
of
sore
injustice
in
which
a
roman
catholic
was
separated
from
her
children
by
a
judicial
decision
obtained
against
her
by
her
husband
a
protestant
was
a
change
in
the
law
which
had
vested
all
power
over
the
children
in
the
hands
of
the
father
and
from
thenceforth
the
rights
of
the
married
mother
were
recognised
to
a
limited
extent
a
small
was
with
the
national
sunday
league
the
president
of
which
lord
thurlow
strongly
objected
to
me
as
one
of
the
taylor
and
others
at
once
resigned
their
offices
and
on
the
calling
of
a
general
meeting
lord
thurlow
was
rejected
as
president
taylor
was
requested
to
assume
the
presidency
and
the
who
had
resigned
were
with
myself
little
battles
of
this
sort
were
a
running
accompaniment
of
graver
struggles
during
all
these
battling
years
and
through
all
the
struggles
the
organised
strength
of
the
freethought
party
grew
new
members
being
enrolled
in
the
national
secular
society
in
the
year
and
in
july
the
public
adhesion
of
edward
aveling
brought
into
the
ranks
a
pen
of
rare
force
and
power
and
gave
a
strong
impulse
to
the
educational
side
of
our
movement
i
presided
for
him
at
his
first
lecture
at
the
hall
of
science
on
august
and
he
soon
paid
the
penalty
of
his
boldness
finding
himself
a
few
months
later
dismissed
from
the
chair
of
comparative
anatomy
at
the
london
hospital
though
the
board
admitted
that
all
his
duties
were
discharged
with
punctuality
and
ability
one
of
the
first
results
of
his
adhesion
was
the
establishment
of
two
classes
under
the
science
and
art
department
at
south
kensington
and
these
grew
year
after
year
attended
by
numbers
of
young
men
and
women
till
in
we
had
thirteen
classes
in
full
swing
as
well
as
latin
and
london
university
matriculation
classes
all
these
were
taught
by
aveling
and
pupils
that
he
had
trained
i
took
advanced
certificates
one
in
honours
and
so
became
qualified
as
a
science
teacher
in
eight
different
sciences
and
alice
and
hypatia
bradlaugh
followed
a
similar
course
so
that
winter
after
winter
we
kept
these
classes
going
from
september
to
the
following
may
from
until
the
year
in
addition
to
these
miss
bradlaugh
carried
on
a
choral
union
personally
i
found
that
this
study
and
teaching
together
with
attendance
at
classes
held
for
teachers
at
south
kensington
the
study
for
passing
the
first
and
prel
sc
examinations
at
london
university
and
the
study
for
the
degree
at
london
at
which
i
failed
in
practical
chemistry
three
times
a
thing
that
puzzled
me
not
a
little
at
the
time
as
i
had
passed
a
far
more
difficult
practical
chemical
examination
for
teachers
at
south
kensington
all
this
gave
me
a
knowledge
of
science
that
has
stood
me
in
good
stead
in
my
public
work
but
even
here
theological
and
social
hatred
pursued
me
when
miss
bradlaugh
and
myself
applied
for
permission
to
attend
the
botany
class
at
university
college
we
were
refused
i
for
my
sins
and
she
only
for
being
her
father
daughter
when
i
had
qualified
as
teacher
i
stood
back
from
claiming
recognition
from
the
department
for
a
year
in
order
not
to
prejudice
the
claims
of
daughters
and
later
when
i
had
been
recognised
sir
henry
tyler
in
the
house
of
commons
attacked
the
education
department
for
accepting
me
and
actually
tried
to
prevent
the
government
grant
being
paid
to
the
hall
of
science
schools
because
aveling
the
misses
bradlaugh
and
myself
were
unbelievers
in
christianity
when
i
asked
permission
to
go
to
the
botanical
gardens
in
regent
park
the
curator
refused
it
on
the
ground
that
his
daughters
studied
there
on
every
side
repulse
and
insult
hard
to
struggle
against
bitter
to
bear
it
was
against
difficulties
of
this
kind
on
every
side
that
we
had
to
make
our
way
handicapped
in
every
effort
by
our
heresy
let
our
work
be
as
good
as
it
might
and
our
science
school
was
exceptionally
successful
the
subtle
fragrance
of
heresy
was
everywhere
distinguishable
and
when
bradlaugh
and
myself
are
blamed
for
bitterness
in
our
advocacy
this
constant
gnawing
annoyance
and
petty
persecution
should
be
taken
into
account
for
him
it
was
especially
trying
for
he
saw
his
daughters
girls
of
ability
and
of
high
character
whose
only
crime
was
that
they
were
his
insulted
sneered
at
slandered
continually
put
at
a
disadvantage
because
they
were
his
children
and
loved
and
honoured
him
beyond
all
others
it
was
in
october
that
i
first
met
herbert
burrows
though
i
did
not
become
intimately
acquainted
with
him
till
the
socialist
troubles
of
the
autumn
of
drew
us
into
a
common
stream
of
work
he
came
as
a
delegate
from
the
tower
hamlets
radical
association
to
a
preliminary
conference
called
by
bradlaugh
at
the
hall
of
science
on
october
to
consider
the
advisability
of
holding
a
great
london
convention
on
land
law
reform
to
be
attended
by
delegates
from
all
parts
of
the
kingdom
he
was
appointed
on
the
executive
committee
with
bradlaugh
mottershead
nieass
and
others
the
convention
was
successfully
held
and
an
advanced
platform
of
land
law
reform
adopted
used
later
by
bradlaugh
as
a
basis
for
some
of
the
proposals
he
laid
before
parliament
chapter
xi
bradlaugh
struggle
and
now
dawned
the
year
the
memorable
year
in
which
commenced
bradlaugh
long
parliamentary
battle
after
a
long
and
bitter
struggle
he
was
elected
with
labouchere
as
member
for
northampton
at
the
general
election
and
so
the
prize
so
long
fought
for
was
won
shall
i
ever
forget
that
election
day
april
how
at
four
bradlaugh
came
into
the
room
at
the
george
where
his
daughters
and
i
were
sitting
flung
himself
into
a
chair
with
there
nothing
more
to
do
our
last
man
is
polled
then
the
waiting
for
the
declaration
through
the
long
weary
hours
of
suspense
till
as
the
time
drew
near
we
knelt
by
the
window
listening
listening
to
the
hoarse
murmur
of
the
crowd
knowing
that
presently
there
would
be
a
roar
of
triumph
or
a
howl
of
anger
when
the
numbers
were
read
out
from
the
steps
of
the
town
hall
and
now
silence
sank
and
we
knew
the
moment
had
come
and
we
held
our
breath
and
then
a
roar
a
wild
roar
of
joy
and
exultation
cheer
after
cheer
ringing
throbbing
pealing
and
then
the
mighty
surge
of
the
crowd
bringing
him
back
their
member
at
last
waving
hats
handkerchiefs
a
very
madness
of
tumultuous
delight
and
the
shrill
strains
of
bradlaugh
for
northampton
with
a
ring
of
triumph
in
them
they
had
never
had
before
and
he
very
grave
somewhat
shaken
by
the
outpour
of
love
and
exultation
very
silent
feeling
the
weight
of
new
responsibility
more
than
the
gladness
of
victory
and
then
the
next
morning
as
he
left
the
town
the
mass
of
men
and
women
one
sea
of
heads
from
hotel
to
station
every
window
crowded
his
colours
waving
everywhere
men
fighting
to
get
near
him
to
touch
him
women
sobbing
the
cries
our
charlie
our
charlie
we
got
you
and
we
keep
you
how
they
loved
him
how
they
joyed
in
the
triumph
won
after
twelve
years
of
strife
ah
me
we
thought
the
struggle
over
and
it
was
only
beginning
we
thought
our
hero
victorious
and
a
fiercer
crueller
fight
lay
in
front
true
he
was
to
win
that
fight
but
his
life
was
to
be
the
price
of
the
winning
victory
for
him
was
to
be
final
complete
but
the
was
to
fall
upon
a
grave
illustration
a
photograph
by
westley
vernon
street
charles
bradlaugh
and
henry
labouchere
the
outburst
of
anger
from
the
more
bigoted
of
the
christian
community
was
as
savage
as
the
outburst
of
delight
had
been
exultant
but
we
recked
little
of
it
was
he
not
member
duly
elected
without
possibility
of
assailment
in
his
legal
right
parliament
was
to
meet
on
april
the
beginning
on
the
following
day
and
bradlaugh
had
taken
counsel
with
some
other
freethinking
members
as
to
the
right
of
freethinkers
to
affirm
he
held
that
under
the
act
and
vict
and
the
evidence
amendment
acts
and
the
right
to
substitute
affirmation
for
oath
was
clear
he
was
willing
to
take
the
oath
as
a
necessary
form
if
obligatory
but
believing
it
to
be
optional
he
preferred
affirmation
on
may
he
presented
himself
and
according
to
the
evidence
of
sir
erskine
may
the
clerk
of
the
house
given
before
the
second
select
committee
on
his
case
he
came
to
the
table
and
delivered
the
following
statement
in
writing
to
the
clerk
the
right
honourable
the
speaker
of
the
house
of
commons
i
the
undersigned
charles
bradlaugh
beg
respectfully
to
claim
to
be
allowed
to
affirm
as
a
person
for
the
time
being
by
law
permitted
to
make
a
solemn
affirmation
or
declaration
instead
of
taking
an
oath
signed
charles
bradlaugh
and
being
asked
by
the
clerk
upon
what
grounds
he
claimed
to
make
an
affirmation
he
answered
virtue
of
the
evidence
amendment
acts
and
whereupon
the
clerk
reported
to
speaker
the
claim
and
speaker
told
bradlaugh
that
he
might
address
the
house
on
the
matter
observations
were
very
short
he
repeated
that
he
relied
upon
the
evidence
further
amendment
act
and
the
evidence
amendment
act
adding
have
repeatedly
for
nine
years
past
made
an
affirmation
in
the
highest
courts
of
jurisdiction
in
this
realm
i
am
ready
to
make
such
a
declaration
or
affirmation
substantially
those
were
the
words
which
he
addressed
to
the
speaker
this
was
the
simple
quiet
and
dignified
scene
which
took
place
in
the
house
bradlaugh
was
directed
to
withdraw
and
he
withdrew
and
after
debate
a
select
committee
was
appointed
to
consider
whether
he
could
make
affirmation
that
committee
decided
against
the
claim
and
gave
in
its
report
on
may
on
the
following
day
bradlaugh
presented
himself
at
the
table
of
the
house
to
take
the
oath
in
the
form
prescribed
by
the
law
and
on
the
objection
of
sir
henry
drummond
wolff
who
submitted
a
motion
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
take
the
oath
another
committee
was
appointed
before
this
committee
bradlaugh
stated
his
case
and
pointed
out
that
the
legal
obligation
lay
on
him
to
take
the
oath
adding
any
form
that
i
went
through
any
oath
that
i
took
i
should
regard
as
binding
upon
my
conscience
in
the
fullest
degree
i
would
go
through
no
form
i
would
take
no
oath
unless
i
meant
it
to
be
so
binding
he
wrote
in
the
same
sense
to
the
saying
that
he
should
regard
himself
as
bound
not
by
the
letter
of
its
words
but
by
the
spirit
which
the
affirmation
would
have
conveyed
had
i
been
permitted
to
use
it
the
committee
reported
against
him
and
on
june
he
was
heard
at
the
bar
of
the
house
and
made
a
speech
so
so
noble
so
dignified
that
the
house
in
defiance
of
all
its
own
rules
broke
out
over
and
over
again
into
applause
in
the
debate
that
preceded
his
speech
members
had
lost
sight
of
the
ordinary
rules
of
decency
and
had
used
expressions
against
myself
wholly
gratuitous
in
such
a
quarrel
the
grave
rebuke
to
him
who
was
wanting
in
chivalry
because
while
i
can
answer
for
myself
and
am
able
to
answer
for
myself
nothing
justified
the
introduction
of
any
other
name
beside
my
own
to
make
prejudice
against
me
brought
irrepressible
cheers
his
appeal
was
wholly
to
the
law
i
have
not
yet
used
i
trust
no
passion
may
tempt
me
into
using
any
words
that
would
seem
to
savour
of
even
a
desire
to
enter
into
conflict
with
this
house
i
have
always
taught
preached
and
believed
the
supremacy
of
parliament
and
it
is
not
because
for
a
moment
the
judgment
of
one
chamber
of
parliament
should
be
hostile
to
me
that
i
am
going
to
deny
the
ideas
i
have
always
held
but
i
submit
that
one
chamber
of
parliament
even
its
grandest
chamber
as
i
have
always
held
this
to
be
had
no
right
to
override
the
law
the
law
gives
me
the
right
to
sign
that
roll
to
take
and
subscribe
the
oath
and
to
take
my
seat
there
with
a
gesture
towards
the
benches
i
admit
that
the
moment
i
am
in
the
house
without
any
reason
but
your
own
good
will
you
can
send
me
away
that
is
your
right
you
have
full
control
over
your
members
but
you
can
not
send
me
away
until
i
have
been
heard
in
my
place
not
a
suppliant
as
i
am
now
but
with
the
rightful
audience
that
each
member
has
always
had
i
am
ready
to
admit
if
you
please
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
every
opinion
i
hold
is
wrong
and
deserves
punishment
let
the
law
punish
it
if
you
say
the
law
can
not
then
you
admit
that
you
have
no
right
and
i
appeal
to
public
opinion
against
the
iniquity
of
a
decision
which
overrides
the
law
and
denies
me
justice
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
and
that
of
the
house
too
if
in
this
warmth
there
seems
to
lack
respect
for
its
dignity
and
as
i
shall
have
if
your
decision
be
against
me
to
come
to
that
table
when
your
decision
is
given
i
beg
you
before
the
step
is
taken
in
which
we
may
both
lose
our
dignity
mine
is
not
much
but
yours
is
that
of
the
commons
of
england
i
beg
you
before
the
gauntlet
is
fatally
thrown
i
beg
you
not
in
any
sort
of
menace
not
in
any
sort
of
boast
but
as
one
man
against
six
hundred
to
give
me
that
justice
which
on
the
other
side
of
this
hall
the
judges
would
give
me
were
i
pleading
there
before
them
but
no
eloquence
no
plea
for
justice
could
stay
the
tide
of
tory
and
religious
bigotry
and
the
house
voted
that
he
should
not
be
allowed
to
take
the
oath
summoned
to
the
table
to
hear
the
decision
communicated
by
the
speaker
he
answered
that
decision
with
the
words
firmly
spoken
i
respectfully
refuse
to
obey
the
order
of
the
house
because
that
order
was
against
the
law
the
speaker
appealed
to
the
house
for
direction
and
on
a
division
during
which
the
speaker
and
charles
bradlaugh
were
left
together
in
the
chamber
the
house
ordered
the
enforcement
of
bradlaugh
withdrawal
once
more
the
order
is
given
once
more
the
refusal
made
and
then
the
was
bidden
to
remove
him
strange
was
the
scene
as
little
captain
cosset
walked
up
to
the
member
of
herculean
proportions
and
men
wondered
how
the
order
would
be
enforced
but
charles
bradlaugh
was
not
the
man
to
make
a
vulgar
brawl
and
the
light
touch
on
his
shoulder
was
to
him
the
touch
of
an
authority
he
admitted
and
to
which
he
bowed
so
he
gravely
accompanied
his
small
captor
and
was
lodged
in
the
clock
tower
of
the
house
as
prisoner
until
the
house
should
further
consider
what
to
do
with
him
the
most
awkward
prisoner
it
had
ever
had
in
that
in
his
person
it
was
imprisoning
the
law
in
a
special
issue
of
the
giving
an
account
of
the
committee
work
and
of
bradlaugh
committal
to
the
clock
tower
i
find
the
following
from
my
own
pen
the
tory
party
beaten
at
the
polls
by
the
nation
has
thus
for
the
moment
triumphed
in
the
house
of
commons
the
man
chosen
by
the
radicals
of
northampton
has
been
committed
to
prison
on
the
motion
of
the
tory
of
the
exchequer
simply
because
he
desires
to
discharge
the
duty
laid
upon
him
by
his
constituency
and
by
the
law
of
the
land
as
this
paper
goes
to
press
i
go
to
westminster
to
receive
from
him
his
directions
as
to
the
conduct
of
the
struggle
with
the
nation
into
which
the
house
of
commons
has
so
recklessly
plunged
i
found
him
busily
writing
prepared
for
all
events
ready
for
a
long
imprisonment
on
the
following
day
a
leaflet
from
my
pen
law
makers
and
law
breakers
appealed
to
the
people
after
reciting
what
had
happened
it
concluded
let
the
people
speak
gladstone
and
bright
are
for
liberty
and
the
help
denied
them
within
the
house
must
come
to
them
from
without
no
time
must
be
lost
while
we
remain
idle
a
representative
of
the
people
is
illegally
held
in
prison
northampton
is
insulted
and
in
this
great
constituency
every
constituency
is
threatened
on
freedom
of
election
depends
our
liberty
on
freedom
of
conscience
depends
our
progress
tory
squires
and
lordlings
have
defied
the
people
and
measured
their
strength
against
the
masses
let
the
masses
speak
but
there
was
no
need
to
make
appeals
for
the
outrage
itself
caused
so
swiftly
a
growl
of
anger
that
on
the
very
next
day
the
prisoner
was
set
free
and
there
came
protest
upon
protest
against
the
action
of
the
house
in
westminster
hall
people
gathered
to
cheer
bradlaugh
when
he
came
to
the
house
on
the
day
after
his
liberation
in
less
than
a
week
meetings
had
thundered
out
their
protest
liberal
associations
clubs
societies
sent
up
messages
of
anger
and
of
demand
for
justice
in
trafalgar
square
there
gathered
so
said
the
papers
the
largest
crowd
ever
seen
there
and
on
the
thursday
following
the
meeting
was
held
on
monday
the
house
of
commons
rescinded
its
resolution
refusing
to
allow
bradlaugh
to
affirm
and
admitted
him
on
friday
july
to
take
his
seat
after
affirmation
at
last
the
bitter
struggle
is
over
i
wrote
and
law
and
right
have
triumphed
the
house
of
commons
has
by
rescinding
the
resolution
passed
by
tories
and
ultramontanes
its
good
name
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
the
triumph
is
not
one
of
freethought
over
christianity
nor
is
it
over
the
house
of
commons
it
is
the
triumph
of
law
brought
about
by
good
men
of
all
shades
of
opinion
but
of
one
faith
in
justice
over
tory
contempt
of
law
and
ultramontane
bigotry
it
is
the
reassertion
of
civil
and
religious
liberty
under
the
most
difficult
circumstances
the
declaration
that
the
house
of
commons
is
the
creation
of
the
people
and
not
a
club
of
the
aristocracy
with
the
right
of
blackballing
in
its
own
hands
the
battle
between
charles
bradlaugh
and
his
persecutors
was
now
transferred
to
the
law
courts
as
soon
as
he
had
taken
his
seat
he
was
served
with
a
writ
for
having
voted
without
having
taken
the
oath
and
this
began
the
wearisome
proceedings
by
which
his
defeated
enemies
boasted
that
they
would
make
him
bankrupt
and
so
vacate
the
seat
he
had
so
hardly
gained
rich
men
like
newdegate
sued
him
putting
forward
a
man
of
straw
as
nominal
plaintiff
for
many
a
weary
month
bradlaugh
kept
all
his
enemies
at
bay
fighting
each
case
himself
defeated
time
after
time
he
fought
on
finally
carrying
the
cases
to
the
house
of
lords
and
there
winning
them
triumphantly
but
they
were
won
at
such
heavy
cost
of
physical
strength
and
of
money
that
they
undermined
his
strength
and
burdened
him
heavily
with
debt
for
all
this
time
he
had
not
only
to
fight
in
the
law
courts
and
to
attend
scrupulously
to
his
parliamentary
duties
but
he
had
to
earn
his
living
by
lecturing
and
writing
so
that
his
nights
away
from
the
house
were
spent
in
travelling
and
his
days
in
incessant
labour
many
of
his
defeated
foes
turned
their
weapons
against
me
hoping
thus
to
give
him
pain
thus
admiral
sir
john
hay
at
wigton
used
language
of
me
so
coarse
that
the
and
refused
to
print
it
and
the
editor
of
the
described
it
as
language
so
coarse
that
it
could
have
hardly
dropped
from
a
yahoo
august
found
me
at
brussels
whither
i
went
with
miss
hypatia
bradlaugh
to
represent
the
english
freethinkers
at
the
international
freethought
conference
it
was
an
interesting
gathering
attended
by
men
of
reputation
including
ludwig
büchner
a
man
of
noble
and
kindly
nature
an
international
federation
of
freethinkers
was
there
founded
which
did
something
towards
bringing
together
the
freethinkers
of
different
countries
and
held
interesting
congresses
in
the
following
years
in
london
and
amsterdam
but
beyond
these
meetings
it
did
little
and
lacked
energy
and
vitality
in
truth
the
freethought
party
in
each
country
had
so
much
to
do
in
holding
its
own
that
little
time
and
thought
could
be
given
to
international
organisation
for
myself
my
introduction
to
büchner
led
to
much
interesting
correspondence
and
i
translated
with
his
approval
his
mind
in
animals
and
the
enlarged
fourteenth
edition
of
force
and
matter
as
well
as
one
or
two
pamphlets
this
autumn
of
found
the
liberal
government
in
full
tilt
against
the
irish
leaders
and
i
worked
hard
to
raise
english
feeling
in
defence
of
irish
freedom
even
against
attack
by
one
so
much
honoured
as
was
gladstone
it
was
uphill
work
for
harsh
language
had
been
used
against
england
and
all
things
english
but
i
showed
by
definite
figures
all
up
and
down
england
that
life
and
property
were
far
safer
in
ireland
than
in
england
that
ireland
was
singularly
free
from
crime
save
in
agrarian
disputes
and
i
argued
that
these
would
disappear
if
the
law
should
step
in
between
landlord
and
tenant
and
by
stopping
the
crimes
of
and
most
brutal
eviction
put
an
end
to
the
horrible
retaliations
that
were
born
of
despair
and
revenge
a
striking
point
on
these
evictions
i
quoted
from
who
using
gladstone
words
that
a
sentence
of
eviction
was
a
sentence
of
starvation
told
of
processes
of
eviction
issued
in
that
one
year
the
autumn
work
was
varied
by
the
teaching
of
science
classes
a
debate
with
a
clergyman
of
the
church
of
england
and
an
operation
which
kept
me
in
bed
for
three
weeks
but
which
on
the
other
hand
was
useful
for
i
learned
to
write
while
lying
on
my
back
and
accomplished
in
this
fashion
a
good
part
of
the
translation
of
mind
in
animals
and
here
let
me
point
a
moral
about
hard
work
hard
work
kills
no
one
i
find
a
note
in
the
in
from
the
pen
of
bradlaugh
it
is
we
fear
useless
to
add
that
in
the
judgment
of
her
best
friends
besant
has
worked
far
too
hard
during
the
last
two
years
this
is
and
the
thirteen
years
interval
has
been
full
of
incessant
work
and
i
am
working
harder
than
ever
now
and
in
splendid
health
looking
over
the
for
all
these
years
it
seems
to
me
that
it
did
really
fine
educational
work
bradlaugh
strenuous
utterances
on
political
and
theological
matters
aveling
luminous
and
beautiful
scientific
teachings
and
to
my
share
fell
much
of
the
educative
work
on
questions
of
political
and
national
morality
in
our
dealings
with
weaker
nations
we
put
all
our
hearts
into
our
work
and
the
influence
exercised
was
distinctly
in
favour
of
pure
living
and
high
thinking
in
the
spring
of
the
court
of
appeal
decided
against
bradlaugh
right
to
affirm
as
member
of
parliament
and
his
seat
was
declared
vacant
but
he
was
at
once
returned
again
by
the
borough
of
northampton
despite
the
virulence
of
slander
directed
against
him
so
that
he
rightly
described
the
election
as
the
most
bitter
i
have
ever
fought
his
work
in
the
house
had
won
him
golden
opinions
in
the
country
and
he
was
already
recognised
as
a
power
there
so
tory
fear
was
added
to
bigoted
hatred
and
the
efforts
to
keep
him
out
of
the
house
were
increased
he
was
introduced
to
the
house
as
a
new
member
to
take
his
seat
by
labouchere
and
burt
but
sir
stafford
northcote
intervened
and
after
a
lengthy
debate
which
included
a
speech
from
bradlaugh
at
the
bar
a
majority
of
refused
to
allow
him
to
take
the
oath
after
a
prolonged
scene
during
which
bradlaugh
declined
to
withdraw
and
the
house
hesitated
to
use
force
the
house
adjourned
and
finally
the
government
promised
to
bring
in
an
affirmation
bill
and
bradlaugh
promised
with
the
consent
of
his
constituents
to
await
the
decision
of
the
house
on
this
bill
meantime
a
league
for
the
defence
of
constitutional
rights
was
formed
and
the
agitation
in
the
country
grew
wherever
bradlaugh
went
to
speak
vast
crowds
awaited
him
and
he
travelled
from
one
end
of
the
country
to
the
other
the
people
answering
his
appeal
for
justice
with
no
uncertain
voice
on
july
in
consequence
of
tory
obstruction
gladstone
wrote
to
bradlaugh
that
the
government
were
going
to
drop
the
affirmation
bill
and
bradlaugh
thereupon
determined
to
present
himself
once
more
in
the
house
and
fixed
on
august
as
the
date
of
such
action
so
that
the
irish
land
bill
might
get
through
the
house
ere
any
delay
in
business
was
caused
by
him
the
house
was
then
closely
guarded
with
police
the
great
gates
were
closed
reserves
of
police
were
packed
in
the
law
courts
and
all
through
july
this
state
of
siege
continued
on
august
there
was
a
large
meeting
in
trafalgar
square
at
which
delegates
were
present
from
all
parts
of
england
and
from
as
far
north
as
edinburgh
and
on
wednesday
august
bradlaugh
went
down
to
the
house
his
last
words
to
me
were
the
people
know
you
better
than
they
know
any
one
save
myself
whatever
happens
mind
whatever
happens
let
them
do
no
violence
i
trust
to
you
to
keep
them
quiet
he
went
to
the
house
entrance
with
aveling
and
into
the
house
alone
his
daughters
and
i
went
together
and
with
some
hundreds
of
others
carrying
petitions
ten
only
with
each
petition
and
the
ten
rigidly
counted
and
allowed
to
pass
through
the
gate
sufficiently
opened
to
let
one
through
at
a
time
reached
westminster
hall
where
we
waited
on
the
steps
leading
to
the
passage
of
the
lobby
an
inspector
ordered
us
off
i
gently
intimated
that
we
were
within
our
rights
dramatic
order
four
officers
this
way
up
they
marched
and
looked
at
us
and
we
looked
at
them
i
think
you
had
better
consult
inspector
denning
before
you
use
violence
i
remarked
placidly
they
thought
they
had
and
in
a
few
moments
up
came
the
inspector
and
seeing
that
we
were
standing
in
a
place
where
we
had
a
right
to
be
and
were
doing
no
harm
he
rebuked
his
subordinates
and
they
retired
and
left
us
in
peace
a
man
of
much
tact
and
discretion
was
inspector
denning
indeed
all
through
this
the
house
of
commons
police
behaved
admirably
well
even
in
the
attack
they
were
ordered
to
make
on
bradlaugh
the
police
used
as
little
violence
as
they
could
it
was
erskine
the
deputy
and
his
ushers
who
showed
the
brutality
as
aveling
wrote
at
the
time
the
police
disliked
their
work
and
as
brave
men
had
a
sympathy
for
a
brave
man
their
orders
they
obeyed
rigidly
this
done
they
were
kindness
itself
gradually
the
crowd
of
petitioners
grew
and
grew
angry
murmurs
were
heard
for
no
news
came
from
the
house
and
they
loved
charlie
and
were
mostly
north
country
men
sturdy
and
independent
they
thought
they
had
a
right
to
go
into
the
lobby
and
suddenly
with
the
impulse
that
will
sway
a
crowd
to
a
single
action
there
was
a
roar
petition
petition
justice
justice
and
they
surged
up
the
steps
charging
at
the
policemen
who
held
the
door
flashed
into
my
mind
my
chief
charge
his
words
i
trust
to
you
to
keep
them
quiet
and
as
the
police
sprang
forward
to
meet
the
crowd
i
threw
myself
between
them
with
all
the
advantage
of
the
position
of
the
top
of
the
steps
that
i
had
chosen
so
that
every
man
in
the
charging
crowd
saw
me
and
as
they
checked
themselves
in
surprise
i
bade
them
stop
for
his
sake
and
keep
for
him
the
peace
which
he
had
bade
us
should
not
be
broken
i
heard
afterwards
that
as
i
sprang
forward
the
police
laughed
they
must
have
thought
me
a
fool
to
face
the
rush
of
the
charging
men
but
i
knew
his
friends
would
never
trample
me
down
and
as
the
crowd
stopped
the
laugh
died
out
and
they
drew
back
and
left
me
my
own
way
sullenly
the
men
drew
back
mastering
themselves
with
effort
reining
in
their
wrath
still
for
his
sake
ah
had
i
known
what
was
going
on
inside
would
i
have
kept
his
trust
unbroken
and
as
many
a
man
said
to
me
afterwards
in
northern
towns
oh
if
you
had
let
us
go
we
would
have
carried
him
into
the
house
up
to
the
speaker
chair
we
heard
a
crash
inside
and
listened
and
there
was
sound
of
breaking
glass
and
splintering
wood
and
in
a
few
minutes
a
messenger
came
to
me
he
is
in
palace
yard
and
we
went
thither
and
saw
him
standing
still
and
white
face
set
like
marble
coat
torn
motionless
as
though
carved
in
stone
facing
the
members
door
now
we
know
the
whole
shameful
story
how
as
that
one
man
stood
alone
on
his
way
to
claim
his
right
alone
so
that
he
could
do
no
violence
fourteen
men
said
the
central
news
police
and
ushers
flung
themselves
upon
him
pushed
and
pulled
him
down
the
stairs
smashing
in
their
violence
the
glass
and
wood
of
the
passage
door
how
he
struck
no
blow
but
used
only
his
great
strength
in
passive
resistance
of
all
i
have
ever
seen
i
never
saw
one
man
struggle
with
ten
like
that
said
one
of
the
chiefs
angrily
disdainful
of
the
wrong
he
was
forced
to
do
till
they
flung
him
out
into
palace
yard
an
thus
reported
the
scene
in
the
press
the
strong
broad
heavy
powerful
frame
of
bradlaugh
was
hard
to
move
with
its
every
nerve
and
muscle
strained
to
resist
the
coercion
bending
and
straining
against
the
overpowering
numbers
he
held
every
inch
with
surprising
tenacity
and
only
surrendered
it
after
almost
superhuman
exertions
to
retain
it
the
sight
little
of
it
as
was
seen
from
the
outside
soon
became
sickening
the
overborne
man
appeared
almost
at
his
last
gasp
the
face
in
spite
of
the
warmth
of
the
struggle
had
an
ominous
pallor
the
limbs
barely
sustained
him
the
trafalgar
square
phrase
that
this
man
might
be
broken
but
not
bent
occurred
to
minds
apprehensive
at
the
present
appearance
of
him
they
flung
him
out
and
swift
short
words
were
there
interchanged
i
nearly
did
wrong
at
the
door
he
said
afterwards
i
was
very
angry
i
said
to
inspector
denning
shall
come
again
with
force
enough
to
overcome
it
he
said
i
said
a
minute
if
i
raise
my
hand
he
stood
in
palace
yard
and
there
outside
the
gate
was
a
vast
sea
of
heads
the
men
who
had
journeyed
from
all
parts
of
england
for
love
of
him
and
in
defence
of
the
great
right
he
represented
of
a
constituency
to
send
to
parliament
the
man
of
its
choice
ah
he
was
never
greater
than
in
that
moment
of
outrage
and
of
triumphant
wrong
with
all
the
passion
of
a
proud
man
surging
within
him
insulted
by
physical
violence
injured
by
the
cruel
wrenching
of
all
his
muscles
so
that
for
weeks
his
arms
had
to
be
swathed
in
bandages
he
was
never
greater
than
when
he
conquered
his
own
wrath
crushed
down
his
own
longing
for
battle
stirred
to
flame
by
the
bodily
struggle
and
the
bodily
injury
and
with
thousands
waiting
within
sound
of
his
voice
longing
to
leap
to
his
side
he
gave
the
word
to
tell
them
to
meet
him
that
evening
away
from
the
scene
of
conflict
and
meanwhile
to
disperse
quietly
no
riot
no
disorder
but
how
he
suffered
mentally
no
words
of
mine
may
tell
and
none
can
understand
how
it
wrung
his
heart
who
does
not
know
how
he
reverenced
the
great
parliament
of
england
how
he
honoured
law
how
he
believed
in
justice
being
done
it
was
the
breaking
down
of
his
national
ideals
of
his
pride
in
his
country
of
his
belief
that
faith
would
be
kept
with
a
foe
by
english
gentlemen
who
with
all
their
faults
he
thought
held
honour
and
chivalry
dear
no
man
will
sleep
in
gaol
for
me
he
said
to
me
that
day
no
woman
can
blame
me
for
her
husband
killed
or
wounded
but
a
wave
of
agony
swept
over
his
face
and
from
that
fatal
day
charles
bradlaugh
was
never
the
same
man
some
hold
their
ideals
lightly
but
his
were
twined
round
his
some
care
little
for
their
country
he
was
an
englishman
to
his
heart
core
of
the
type
of
the
patriot
holding
england
honour
dear
it
was
the
treachery
that
broke
his
heart
he
had
gone
alone
believing
in
the
honour
of
his
foes
ready
to
submit
to
expulsion
to
imprisonment
and
it
was
the
latter
that
he
expected
but
he
never
dreamed
that
going
alone
amongst
his
foes
they
would
use
brutal
and
cowardly
violence
and
shame
every
parliamentary
tradition
by
personal
outrage
on
a
member
outrage
more
worthy
of
a
slum
than
of
the
great
commons
house
the
house
of
hampden
and
of
vane
the
house
that
had
guarded
its
own
from
royal
violence
and
had
maintained
its
privileges
in
the
teeth
of
kings
these
stormy
scenes
brought
about
a
promise
of
government
aid
bradlaugh
failed
to
get
any
legal
redress
as
indeed
he
expected
to
fail
on
the
ground
that
the
officials
of
the
house
were
covered
by
the
house
order
but
the
government
promised
to
support
his
claim
to
his
seat
during
the
next
session
and
thus
prevented
the
campaign
against
them
on
which
we
had
resolved
i
had
solely
on
my
own
responsibility
organised
a
great
band
of
people
pledged
to
refrain
from
the
use
of
all
excisable
articles
after
a
certain
date
and
to
withdraw
all
their
moneys
in
the
savings
bank
thus
seriously
crippling
the
financial
resources
of
the
government
the
response
from
the
workers
to
my
appeal
to
stop
the
supplies
was
great
and
touching
one
man
wrote
that
as
he
never
drank
nor
smoked
he
would
leave
off
tea
others
that
though
tobacco
was
their
one
luxury
they
would
forego
it
and
so
on
somewhat
reluctantly
i
asked
the
people
to
lay
aside
this
formidable
weapon
as
we
have
no
right
to
embarrass
the
government
financially
save
when
they
refuse
to
do
the
first
duty
of
a
government
to
maintain
law
they
have
now
promised
to
do
justice
and
we
must
wait
meanwhile
the
injuries
inflicted
on
bradlaugh
rupturing
the
sheaths
of
some
of
the
muscles
of
the
arm
laid
him
prostrate
and
various
small
fights
went
on
during
the
temporary
truce
in
the
great
struggle
i
turned
up
in
the
house
two
or
three
times
haled
thither
though
not
in
person
by
the
people
who
kept
bradlaugh
out
and
a
speech
of
mine
became
the
subject
of
a
question
by
ritchie
while
sir
henry
tyler
waged
war
on
the
science
classes
another
joy
was
added
to
life
by
the
use
of
my
name
which
by
all
these
struggles
had
gained
a
marketable
value
as
author
of
pamphlets
i
had
never
seen
and
this
forgery
of
my
name
by
unscrupulous
people
in
the
colonies
caused
me
a
good
deal
of
annoyance
in
the
strengthening
of
the
constitutional
agitation
in
the
country
the
holding
of
an
international
congress
of
freethinkers
in
london
the
studying
and
teaching
of
science
the
delivering
of
courses
of
scientific
lectures
in
the
hall
of
science
a
sharp
correspondence
with
the
bishop
of
manchester
who
had
libelled
secularists
and
which
led
to
a
fiery
pamphlet
god
views
on
marriage
as
retort
in
all
these
matters
the
autumn
months
sped
rapidly
away
one
incident
of
that
autumn
i
record
with
regret
i
was
misled
by
very
partial
knowledge
of
the
nature
of
the
experiments
performed
and
by
my
fear
that
if
scientific
men
were
forbidden
to
experiment
on
animals
with
drugs
they
would
perforce
experiment
with
them
on
the
poor
in
hospitals
to
write
two
articles
republished
as
a
pamphlet
against
sir
eardley
wilmot
bill
for
the
total
suppression
of
vivisection
i
limited
my
approval
to
highly
skilled
men
engaged
in
original
investigations
and
took
the
representations
made
of
the
character
of
the
experiments
without
sufficient
care
to
verify
them
hence
the
publication
of
the
one
thing
i
ever
wrote
for
which
i
feel
deep
regret
and
shame
as
against
the
whole
trend
and
efforts
of
my
life
i
am
thankful
to
say
that
anna
kingsford
answered
my
articles
and
i
readily
inserted
her
replies
in
the
paper
in
which
mine
had
appeared
our
and
she
touched
that
question
of
the
moral
sense
to
which
my
nature
at
once
responded
ultimately
i
looked
carefully
into
the
subject
found
that
vivisection
abroad
was
very
different
from
vivisection
in
england
saw
that
it
was
in
very
truth
the
fiendishly
cruel
thing
that
its
opponents
alleged
and
destroyed
my
partial
defence
of
even
its
less
brutal
form
saw
no
cessation
of
the
struggles
in
which
bradlaugh
and
those
who
stood
by
him
were
involved
on
february
he
was
heard
for
the
third
time
at
the
bar
of
the
house
of
commons
and
closed
his
speech
with
an
offer
that
accepted
would
have
closed
the
contest
i
am
ready
to
stand
aside
say
for
four
or
five
weeks
without
coming
to
that
table
if
the
house
within
that
time
or
within
such
time
as
its
great
needs
might
demand
would
discuss
whether
an
affirmation
bill
should
pass
or
not
i
want
to
obey
the
law
and
i
tell
you
how
i
might
meet
the
house
still
further
if
the
house
will
pardon
me
for
seeming
to
advise
it
hon
members
have
said
that
would
be
a
bradlaugh
relief
bill
bradlaugh
is
more
proud
than
you
are
let
the
bill
pass
without
applying
to
elections
that
have
taken
place
previously
and
i
will
undertake
not
to
claim
my
seat
and
when
the
bill
has
passed
i
will
apply
for
the
chiltern
hundreds
i
have
no
fear
if
i
am
not
fit
for
my
constituents
they
shall
dismiss
me
but
you
never
shall
the
grave
alone
shall
make
me
yield
but
the
house
would
do
nothing
he
had
asked
for
signatures
in
favour
of
his
constitutional
right
and
on
february
and
petitions
bearing
signatures
were
presented
the
house
treated
them
with
contemptuous
indifference
the
house
refused
to
declare
his
seat
vacant
and
also
refused
to
allow
him
to
fill
it
thus
northampton
while
closing
every
avenue
to
legal
redress
labouchere
who
did
all
a
loyal
colleague
could
do
to
assist
his
brother
member
brought
in
an
affirmation
bill
it
was
blocked
gladstone
appealed
to
support
the
law
declared
by
his
own
refused
to
do
anything
an
was
created
and
all
the
enemies
of
freedom
rejoiced
out
of
this
position
of
what
the
called
quiet
omnipotence
the
house
was
shaken
by
an
audacious
defiance
for
on
february
the
member
it
was
trying
to
hold
at
arm
length
took
the
oath
in
its
startled
face
went
to
his
seat
and
waited
events
the
house
then
expelled
him
and
indeed
it
could
scarcely
do
anything
else
after
such
defiance
and
labouchere
moved
for
a
new
writ
declaring
that
northampton
was
ready
its
candidate
was
charles
bradlaugh
expelled
this
house
northampton
ever
steadfast
returned
him
for
the
third
time
the
vote
in
his
favour
showing
an
increase
of
over
the
second
and
the
triumph
was
received
in
all
the
great
towns
of
england
with
wild
enthusiasm
by
the
small
majority
of
fifteen
in
a
house
of
members
and
this
due
to
the
vacillation
of
the
government
he
was
again
refused
the
right
to
take
his
seat
but
now
the
whole
liberal
press
took
up
his
quarrel
the
oath
question
became
a
test
question
for
every
candidate
for
parliament
and
the
government
was
warned
that
it
was
alienating
its
best
friends
the
mall
voiced
the
general
feeling
what
is
the
evidence
that
an
oaths
bill
would
injure
the
government
in
the
country
of
one
thing
we
may
be
sure
that
if
they
shirk
the
bill
they
will
do
no
good
to
themselves
at
the
elections
nobody
doubts
that
it
will
be
made
a
test
question
and
any
liberal
who
declines
to
vote
for
such
a
bill
will
certainly
lose
the
support
of
the
northampton
sort
of
radicalism
in
every
constituency
the
liberal
press
throughout
the
country
is
absolutely
unanimous
the
political
are
for
it
the
local
clubs
are
for
it
all
that
is
wanted
is
that
the
government
should
pick
up
a
little
more
moral
courage
and
recognise
that
even
in
practice
honesty
is
the
best
policy
the
government
did
not
think
so
and
they
paid
the
penalty
for
one
of
the
causes
that
led
to
their
defeat
at
the
polls
was
the
disgust
felt
at
their
vacillation
and
cowardice
in
regard
to
the
rights
of
constituencies
not
untruly
did
i
write
in
may
that
charles
bradlaugh
was
a
man
who
by
the
infliction
of
a
great
wrong
had
become
the
incarnation
of
a
great
principle
for
the
agitation
in
the
country
grew
and
grew
until
returned
again
to
parliament
at
the
general
election
he
took
the
oath
and
his
seat
brought
in
and
carried
an
oaths
bill
not
only
giving
members
of
parliament
the
right
to
affirm
but
making
freethinkers
competent
as
jurymen
and
relieving
witnesses
from
the
insult
hitherto
put
upon
those
who
objected
to
swearing
he
thus
ended
an
unprecedented
struggle
by
a
complete
victory
weaving
his
name
for
ever
into
the
constitutional
history
of
his
country
in
the
house
of
lords
lord
redesdale
brought
in
a
bill
disqualifying
atheists
from
sitting
in
parliament
but
in
face
of
the
feeling
aroused
in
the
country
the
lords
with
many
pathetic
expressions
of
regret
declined
to
pass
it
but
meanwhile
sir
henry
tyler
in
the
commons
was
calling
out
for
prosecutions
for
blasphemy
to
be
brought
against
bradlaugh
and
his
friends
while
he
carried
on
his
crusade
against
bradlaugh
daughters
aveling
and
myself
as
science
teachers
i
summed
up
the
position
in
the
spring
of
in
the
following
somewhat
strong
language
this
declaration
bill
is
but
one
of
the
many
clouds
which
presage
a
storm
of
prosecution
the
reiterated
attempts
in
the
house
of
commons
to
force
the
government
into
prosecuting
heretics
for
blasphemy
the
petty
and
vicious
attacks
on
the
science
classes
at
the
hall
the
odious
and
wicked
efforts
of
newdegate
to
drive
bradlaugh
into
the
bankruptcy
court
all
these
are
but
signs
that
the
heterogeneous
army
of
pious
and
bigoted
christians
are
gathering
together
their
forces
for
a
furious
attack
on
those
who
have
silenced
them
in
argument
but
whom
they
hope
to
conquer
by
main
force
by
sheer
brutality
let
them
come
were
never
so
strong
never
so
united
never
so
well
organised
as
they
are
strong
in
the
goodness
of
our
cause
in
our
faith
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
truth
in
our
willingness
to
give
up
all
save
fidelity
to
the
sacred
cause
of
liberty
of
human
thought
and
human
speech
we
await
gravely
and
fearlessly
the
successors
of
the
men
who
burned
bruno
who
imprisoned
galileo
who
tortured
vanini
the
men
who
have
in
their
hands
the
cross
of

of

in
their
hearts
the
love
of
god
and
the
hate

of
those
imprisoned
on
suspicion
for
indemnity
for
those
who
before
the
land
act
had
striven
against
wrongs
the
land
act
had
been
carried
to
prevent
and
i
urged
that
no
chance
is
given
for
the
healing
measures
to
cure
the
sore
of
irish
disaffection
until
not
only
are
the
prisoners
in
ireland
set
at
liberty
but
until
the
brave
unfortunate
michael
davitt
stands
once
more
a
free
man
on
irish
soil
at
last
the
government
reconsidered
its
policy
and
resolved
on
juster
dealings
it
sent
lord
frederick
cavendish
over
to
ireland
carrying
with
him
the
release
of
the
suspects
and
scarcely
had
he
landed
ere
the
knife
of
assassination
struck
him
a
foul
and
cowardly
murder
of
an
innocent
messenger
of
peace
i
was
at
blackburn
to
lecture
on
the
irish
question
and
as
i
was
walking
towards
the
platform
my
heart
full
of
joy
for
the
dawning
hope
of
peace
a
telegram
announcing
the
assassination
was
placed
in
my
hands
never
shall
i
forget
the
shock
the
incredulous
horror
the
wave
of
despair
it
is
not
only
two
men
they
have
killed
i
wrote
a
day
or
two
later
they
have
stabbed
the
hope
of
friendship
between
two
countries
and
have
reopened
the
gulf
of
hatred
that
was
just
beginning
to
close
alas
the
crime
succeeded
in
its
object
and
hurried
the
government
into
new
wrong
hastily
a
new
coercion
bill
was
brought
in
and
rushed
through
its
stages
in
parliament
and
facing
the
storm
of
public
excitement
i
pleaded
still
force
no
remedy
despite
the
hardship
of
the
task
there
is
excessive
difficulty
in
dealing
with
the
irish
difficulty
at
the
present
moment
tories
are
howling
for
revenge
on
a
whole
nation
as
answer
to
the
crime
committed
by
a
few
whigs
are
swelling
the
outcry
many
radicals
are
swept
away
by
the
current
and
feeling
that
must
be
done
they
endorse
the
government
action
forgetting
to
ask
whether
the
proposed
is
the
wisest
thing
a
few
stand
firm
but
they
are
very
few
too
few
to
prevent
the
new
coercion
bill
from
passing
into
law
but
few
though
we
be
who
lift
up
the
voice
of
protest
against
the
wrong
which
we
are
powerless
to
prevent
we
may
yet
do
much
to
make
the
new
act
of
brief
duration
by
so
rousing
public
opinion
as
to
bring
about
its
early
repeal
when
the
measure
is
understood
by
the
public
half
the
battle
will
be
won
it
is
accepted
at
the
moment
from
faith
in
the
government
it
will
be
rejected
when
its
true
character
is
grasped
the
murders
which
have
given
birth
to
this
repressive
measure
came
with
a
shock
upon
the
country
which
was
the
more
terrible
from
the
sudden
change
from
gladness
and
hope
to
darkness
and
despair
the
new
policy
was
welcomed
so
joyfully
the
messenger
of
the
new
policy
was
slain
ere
yet
the
pen
was
dry
which
had
signed
the
orders
of
mercy
and
of
liberty
small
wonder
that
cry
of
horror
should
be
followed
by
measures
of
vengeance
but
the
murders
were
the
work
of
a
few
criminals
while
the
measure
of
vengeance
strikes
the
whole
of
the
irish
people
i
plead
against
the
panic
which
confounds
political
agitation
and
political
redressal
of
wrong
with
crime
and
its
punishment
the
government
measure
gags
every
mouth
in
ireland
and
puts
as
we
shall
see
all
political
effort
at
the
mercy
of
the
the
magistracy
and
the
police
i
then
sketched
the
misery
of
the
peasants
in
the
grip
of
absentee
landlords
the
turning
out
on
the
roadside
to
die
of
the
mother
with
babe
at
her
breast
the
loss
of
all
thought
of
the
sanctity
of
human
life
when
the
lives
of
the
dearest
are
reckoned
as
less
worth
than
the
shillings
of
overdue
i
analysed
the
new
act
when
this
act
passes
trial
by
jury
right
of
public
meeting
liberty
of
press
sanctity
of
house
will
one
and
all
be
held
at
the
will
of
the
the
irresponsible
autocrat
of
ireland
while
liberty
of
person
will
lie
at
the
mercy
of
every
constable
such
is
england
way
of
governing
ireland
in
the
year
and
this
is
supposed
to
be
a
bill
for
the
of
crime
bluntly
i
put
the
bald
truth
the
plain
fact
is
that
the
murderers
have
succeeded
they
saw
in
the
new
policy
the
reconciliation
of
england
and
ireland
they
knew
that
friendship
would
follow
justice
and
that
the
two
countries
for
the
first
time
in
history
would
clasp
hands
to
prevent
this
they
dug
a
new
gulf
which
they
hoped
the
english
nation
would
not
span
they
sent
a
river
of
blood
across
the
road
of
friendship
and
they
flung
two
corpses
to
bar
the
gate
of
reconciliation
and
peace
they
have
succeeded
into
this
whirl
of
political
and
social
strife
came
the
first
whisper
to
me
of
the
theosophical
society
in
the
shape
of
a
statement
of
its
principles
which
conveyed
i
remarked
no
very
definite
idea
of
the
requirements
for
membership
beyond
a
dreamy
emotional
scholarly
interest
in
the
fancies
of
the
past
also
a
report
of
an
address
by
colonel
olcott
which
led
me
to
suppose
that
the
society
held
to
some
strange
theory
of
of
the
dead
and
to
some
existence
outside
the
physical
and
apart
from
it
these
came
to
me
from
some
hindû
freethinkers
who
asked
my
opinion
as
to
secularists
joining
the
theosophical
society
and
theosophists
being
admitted
to
the
national
secular
society
i
replied
judging
from
these
reports
that
while
secularists
would
have
no
right
to
refuse
to
enrol
theosophists
if
they
desired
it
among
their
members
there
is
a
radical
difference
between
the
mysticism
of
theosophy
and
the
scientific
materialism
of
secularism
the
exclusive
devotion
to
this
world
implied
in
the
profession
of
secularism
leaves
no
room
for
and
consistent
members
of
our
body
can
not
join
a
society
which
professes
belief
therein
blavatsky
penned
a
brief
article
in
the
for
august
in
which
she
commented
on
my
paragraph
remarking
in
her
generous
way
that
it
must
have
been
written
while
labouring
under
entirely
misconceived
notions
about
the
real
nature
of
our
society
for
one
so
highly
intellectual
and
keen
as
that
renowned
writer
to
dogmatise
and
issue
autocratic
ukases
after
she
has
herself
suffered
so
cruelly
and
undeservedly
at
the
hands
of
blind
bigotry
and
social
prejudice
in
her
lifelong
struggle
for
of
seems
to
say
the
least
absurdly
inconsistent
after
quoting
my
paragraph
she
went
on
until
proofs
to
the
contrary
we
prefer
to
believe
that
the
above
lines
were
dictated
to
besant
by
some
crafty
misrepresentations
from
madras
inspired
by
a
mean
personal
revenge
rather
than
a
desire
to
remain
consistent
with
the
principles
of
scientific
materialism
of
secularism
we
beg
to
assure
the
radical
editors
of
the
that
they
were
both
very
strangely
misled
by
false
reports
about
the
radical
editors
of
the
the
term
can
no
more
apply
to
the
latter
than
to
besant
and
c
bradlaugh
blavatsky
when
she
commented
as
she
occasionally
did
on
the
struggles
going
on
in
england
took
of
them
a
singularly
and
generous
view
she
referred
with
much
admiration
to
bradlaugh
work
and
to
his
parliamentary
struggle
and
spoke
warmly
of
the
services
he
had
rendered
to
liberty
again
in
pointing
out
that
spiritualistic
trance
orations
by
no
means
transcended
speeches
that
made
no
such
claim
i
find
her
first
mention
of
myself
another
lady
orator
of
deservedly
great
fame
both
for
eloquence
and
learning
the
good
annie
besant
without
believing
in
controlling
spirits
or
for
that
matter
in
her
own
spirit
yet
speaks
and
writes
such
sensible
and
wise
things
that
we
might
almost
say
that
one
of
her
speeches
or
chapters
contains
more
matter
to
benefit
humanity
than
would
equip
a
modern
for
an
entire
oratorical
career
i
have
sometimes
wondered
of
late
years
whether
had
i
met
her
then
or
seen
any
of
her
writings
i
should
have
become
her
pupil
i
fear
not
i
was
still
too
much
dazzled
by
the
triumphs
of
western
science
too
too
fond
of
combat
too
much
at
the
mercy
of
my
own
emotions
too
sensitive
to
praise
and
blame
i
needed
to
sound
yet
more
deeply
the
depths
of
human
misery
to
hear
yet
more
loudly
the
moaning
of
the
great
orphan
humanity
to
feel
yet
more
keenly
the
lack
of
wider
knowledge
and
of
clearer
light
if
i
were
to
give
effective
help
to
man
ere
i
could
bow
my
pride
to
crave
admittance
as
pupil
to
the
school
of
occultism
ere
i
could
put
aside
my
prejudices
and
study
the
science
of
the
soul
the
attempts
of
sir
henry
tyler
and
his
friends
to
stimulate
persecutions
for
blasphemy
at
length
took
practical
shape
and
in
july
foote
the
editor
ramsey
the
publisher
and
whittle
the
printer
of
the
were
summoned
for
blasphemy
by
sir
henry
tyler
himself
an
attempt
was
made
to
involve
bradlaugh
in
the
proceedings
and
the
solicitors
promised
to
drop
the
case
against
the
editor
and
printer
if
bradlaugh
would
himself
sell
them
some
copies
of
the
paper
but
however
ready
bradlaugh
had
always
shown
himself
to
shield
his
subordinates
by
taking
his
sins
on
his
own
shoulders
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
assume
responsibility
for
a
paper
over
which
he
had
no
control
and
which
was
he
thought
by
its
caricatures
lowering
the
tone
of
freethought
advocacy
and
giving
an
unnecessary
handle
to
its
foes
he
therefore
answered
that
he
would
sell
the
solicitors
any
works
published
by
himself
or
with
his
authority
and
sent
them
a
catalogue
of
the
whole
of
such
works
the
object
of
this
effort
of
sir
henry
tyler
was
obvious
enough
and
bradlaugh
commented
the
above
letters
make
it
pretty
clear
that
sir
henry
tyler
having
failed
in
his
endeavour
to
get
the
science
classes
stopped
at
the
hall
of
science
having
also
failed
in
his
attempt
to
induce
sir
vernon
harcourt
to
prosecute
myself
and
besant
as
editors
and
publishers
of
this
journal
desires
to
make
me
personally
and
criminally
responsible
for
the
contents
of
a
journal
i
neither
edit
nor
publish
over
which
i
have
not
a
shadow
of
control
and
in
which
i
have
not
the
smallest
interest
why
does
sir
tyler
so
ardently
desire
to
prosecute
me
for
blasphemy
is
it
because
two
convictions
will
under
the
and
will
iii
cap
render
me
ever
incapable
of
sitting
in
parliament
the
frankly
put
this
forward
as
an
object
to
be
gained
and
bradlaugh
was
summoned
to
the
mansion
house
on
a
charge
of
publishing
blasphemous
libels
in
the
meanwhile
sir
henry
tyler
put
a
notice
on
the
order
book
to
deprive
the
daughters
of
charles
bradlaugh
of
the
grant
they
had
earned
as
science
teachers
and
got
an
order
which
proved
to
be
invalid
but
which
was
acted
on
to
inspect
bradlaugh
and
my
own
private
banking
accounts
i
being
no
party
to
the
case
looking
back
i
marvel
at
the
incredible
meannesses
to
which
sir
henry
tyler
and
others
stooped
in
defence
of
religion
heaven
save
the
mark
let
me
add
that
his
motion
in
the
house
of
commons
was
a
complete
failure
and
it
was
emphasised
by
the
publication
at
the
same
time
of
the
successful
work
both
as
teachers
and
as
students
of
the
daughters
of
charles
bradlaugh
and
of
my
being
the
only
student
in
all
england
who
had
succeeded
in
taking
honours
in
botany
i
must
pause
a
moment
to
chronicle
in
september
the
death
of
pusey
whom
i
had
sought
in
the
whirl
of
my
early
religious
struggles
i
wrote
an
article
on
him
in
the
and
ended
by
laying
a
tribute
on
his
grave
a
strong
man
and
a
good
man
utterly
out
of
harmony
with
the
spirit
of
his
own
time
looking
with
eyes
on
all
the
eager
research
the
joyous
love
of
nature
the
earnest
inquiry
into
a
world
doomed
to
be
burnt
up
at
the
coming
of
its
judge
an
ascetic
pure
in
life
stern
in
faith
harsh
to
unbelievers
because
sincere
in
his
own
cruel
creed
generous
and
tender
to
all
who
accepted
his
doctrines
and
submitted
to
his
church
he
never
stooped
to
slander
those
with
whom
he
disagreed
his
hatred
of
heresy
led
him
not
to
blacken
the
character
of
heretics
nor
to
descend
to
the
vulgar
abuse
used
by
pettier
priests
and
therefore
i
who
honour
courage
and
sincerity
wherever
i
find
them
i
who
do
homage
to
steadfastness
wherever
i
find
it
i
atheist
lay
my
small
tribute
of
respect
on
the
bier
of
this
noblest
of
the
edward
bouverie
pusey
as
a
practical
answer
to
the
numberless
attacks
made
on
us
and
as
a
result
of
the
enormous
increase
of
circulation
given
to
our
theological
and
political
writings
by
these
harassing
persecutions
we
moved
our
publishing
business
to
fleet
street
at
the
end
of
september
a
shop
facing
that
at
which
richard
carlile
had
carried
on
his
publishing
business
for
a
great
time
and
so
seemed
still
redolent
with
memories
of
his
gallant
struggles
two
of
the
first
things
sold
here
were
a
pamphlet
of
mine
a
strong
protest
against
our
shameful
egyptian
policy
and
a
critical
volume
on
genesis
which
bradlaugh
found
time
to
write
in
the
intervals
of
his
busy
life
here
i
worked
daily
save
when
out
of
london
until
bradlaugh
death
in
assisted
in
the
conduct
of
the
business
by
bradlaugh
elder
daughter
a
woman
of
strong
character
with
many
noble
qualities
who
died
rather
suddenly
in
december
and
in
the
work
on
the
first
by
aveling
and
then
by
john
robertson
its
present
editor
here
too
from
onwards
worked
with
me
thornton
smith
one
of
bradlaugh
most
devoted
disciples
who
became
one
of
the
leading
speakers
of
the
national
secular
society
like
her
chief
she
was
ever
a
good
friend
and
a
good
fighter
and
to
me
the
most
loyal
and
loving
of
colleagues
one
of
the
few
the
very
few
freethinkers
who
were
and
generous
enough
not
to
turn
against
me
when
i
became
a
theosophist
a
second
of
these
alas
i
could
count
them
on
my
fingers
was
the
john
robertson
above
mentioned
a
man
of
rare
ability
and
wide
culture
somewhat
too
scholarly
for
popular
propagandism
of
the
most
generally
effective
order
but
a
man
who
is
a
strength
to
any
movement
always
on
the
side
of
noble
living
and
high
thinking
as
the
true
scot
should
be
incapable
of
meanness
or
treachery
and
the
most
genial
and
generous
of
friends
among
the
new
literary
ventures
that
followed
on
our
taking
the
large
publishing
premises
in
fleet
street
was
a
sixpenny
magazine
edited
by
myself
and
entitled
its
first
number
was
dated
january
and
for
six
years
it
appeared
regularly
and
served
me
as
a
useful
mouthpiece
in
my
socialist
and
labour
propagandist
work
among
its
contributors
were
moncure
conway
professor
ludwig
büchner
yves

ernst
haeckel
bernard
shaw
constance
naden
aveling
levy
joynes
edgren
john
robertson
and
many
another
charles
bradlaugh
and
i
writing
regularly
each
month
broke
stormily
fights
on
every
hand
and
a
huge
constitutional
agitation
going
on
in
the
country
which
forced
the
government
into
bringing
in
an
affirmation
bill
resolutions
from
liberal
associations
all
over
the
land
preparations
to
oppose
the
of
disloyal
members
no
less
than
a
thousand
delegates
sent
up
to
london
by
clubs
trade
unions
associations
of
every
sort
a
meeting
that
packed
trafalgar
square
an
uneasy
crowd
in
westminster
hall
a
request
from
inspector
denning
that
bradlaugh
would
go
out
to
them
they
feared
for
his
safety
inside
a
word
from
him
the
government
have
pledged
themselves
to
bring
in
an
affirmation
bill
at
once
roar
after
roar
of
cheering
a
veritable
people
victory
on
that
of
february
it
was
the
answer
of
the
country
to
the
appeal
for
justice
the
rebuke
of
the
electors
to
the
house
that
had
defied
them
scarcely
was
this
over
when
a
second
prosecution
for
blasphemy
against
foote
ramsey
and
kemp
began
and
was
hurried
on
in
the
central
criminal
court
before
justice
north
a
bigot
of
the
sternest
type
the
trial
ended
in
a
disagreement
of
the
jury
foote
defending
himself
in
a
splendid
speech
the
judge
acted
very
harshly
throughout
interrupted
foote
continuously
and
even
refused
bail
to
the
defendants
during
the
interval
between
the
first
and
second
trial
they
were
therefore
confined
in
newgate
from
thursday
to
monday
and
we
were
only
allowed
to
see
them
through
iron
bars
and
lattice
as
they
exercised
in
the
prison
yard
between
and
brought
up
to
trial
again
on
monday
they
were
convicted
and
foote
was
sentenced
to
a
year
imprisonment
ramsey
to
nine
months
and
kemp
to
three
months
foote
especially
behaved
with
great
dignity
and
courage
in
a
most
difficult
position
and
heard
his
cruel
sentence
without
wincing
and
with
the
calm
words
my
lord
i
thank
you
it
is
worthy
your
creed
a
few
of
us
at
once
stepped
in
to
preserve
to
ramsey
his
shop
and
to
foote
his
literary
property
aveling
undertook
the
editing
of
the
and
of
foote
magazine
the
immediate
necessities
of
their
families
were
seen
to
and
forder
took
charge
of
the
shop
and
within
a
few
days
all
was
in
working
order
disapproving
as
many
of
us
did
of
the
policy
of
the
paper
there
was
no
time
to
think
of
that
when
a
blasphemy
prosecution
had
proved
successful
and
we
all
closed
up
in
the
support
of
men
imprisoned
for
conscience
sake
i
commenced
a
series
of
articles
on
the
christian
creed
what
it
is
blasphemy
to
deny
showing
what
christians
must
believe
under
peril
of
prosecution
everywhere
a
tremendous
impulse
was
given
to
the
freethought
movement
as
men
awakened
to
the
knowledge
that
blasphemy
laws
were
not
obsolete
from
over
the
sea
came
a
word
of
sympathy
from
the
pen
of
blavatsky
in
the
we
prefer
foote
actual
position
to
that
of
his
severe
judge
aye
and
were
we
in
his
guilty
skin
we
would
feel
more
proud
even
in
the
poor
editor
present
position
than
we
would
under
the
wig
of
justice
north
in
april
the
long
legal
struggles
of
bradlaugh
against
newdegate
and
his
common
informer
that
had
lasted
from
july
till
april
ended
in
his
complete
victory
by
the
judgment
of
the
house
of
lords
in
his
favour
court
after
court
decided
against
me
he
wrote
and
whig
and
tory
journals
alike
mocked
at
me
for
my
persistent
resistance
even
some
good
friends
thought
that
my
fight
was
hopeless
and
that
the
bigots
held
me
fast
in
their
toils
i
have
however
at
last
shaken
myself
free
of
newdegate
and
his
common
informer
the
judgment
of
the
house
of
lords
in
my
favour
is
final
and
conclusive
and
the
boasts
of
the
tories
that
i
should
be
made
bankrupt
for
the
penalties
have
now
for
ever
come
to
naught
yet
but
for
the
many
poor
folk
who
have
stood
by
me
with
their
help
and
sympathy
i
should
have
long
since
been
ruined
the
days
and
weeks
spent
in
the
law
courts
the
harassing
work
connected
with
each
stage
of
litigation
the
watching
daily
when
each
hearing
was
imminent
the
absolute
hindrance
of
all
provincial
lecturing
it
is
hardly
possible
for
any
one
to
judge
the
terrible
mental
and
pecuniary
strain
of
all
this
struggle
aye
it
killed
him
at
last
twenty
years
before
his
time
sapping
his
splendid
vitality
undermining
his
iron
constitution
the
blasphemy
trial
of
bradlaugh
foote
and
ramsey
now
came
on
but
this
time
in
the
queen
bench
before
the
lord
chief
justice
coleridge
i
had
the
honour
of
sitting
between
bradlaugh
and
foote
charged
with
the
duty
of
having
ready
for
the
former
all
his
references
and
with
a
duplicate
brief
to
mark
off
point
after
point
as
he
dealt
with
it
foote
and
ramsey
were
brought
up
in
custody
but
were
brave
and
bright
with
courage
unbroken
bradlaugh
applied
to
have
his
case
taken
separately
as
he
denied
responsibility
for
the
paper
and
the
judge
granted
the
application
it
was
clearly
proved
that
he
and
i
the
freethought
publishing
company
had
never
had
anything
to
do
with
the
production
of
the
paper
that
until
november
we
published
it
and
then
refused
to
publish
it
any
longer
that
the
reason
for
the
refusal
was
the
addition
of
comic
bible
illustrations
as
a
feature
of
the
paper
i
was
called
as
witness
and
began
with
a
difficulty
claiming
to
affirm
i
was
asked
by
the
judge
if
the
oath
would
not
be
binding
on
my
conscience
i
answered
that
any
promise
was
binding
on
me
whatever
the
form
and
after
some
little
argument
the
judge
found
a
way
out
of
the
insulting
form
by
asking
whether
the
invocation
of
the
deity
added
anything
to
it
of
a
binding
nature
added
any
sanction
none
my
lord
was
the
prompt
reply
and
i
was
allowed
to
affirm
sir
hardinge
giffard
subjected
me
to
a
very
stringent
doing
his
best
to
entangle
me
but
the
perfect
frankness
of
my
answers
broke
all
his
weapons
of
finesse
and
inuendo
some
of
the
incidents
of
the
trial
were
curious
sir
hardinge
giffard
opening
speech
was
very
able
and
very
unscrupulous
all
facts
in
bradlaugh
favour
were
distorted
or
hidden
anything
that
could
be
used
against
him
was
tricked
out
in
most
seductive
fashion
among
the
many
monstrous
perversions
of
the
truth
made
by
this
most
pious
counsel
was
the
statement
that
changes
of
publisher
and
of
registration
of
the
were
made
in
consequence
of
a
question
as
to
prosecuting
it
put
in
the
house
of
commons
the
change
of
publisher
was
admittedly
made
in
november
the
registration
was
made
for
the
first
time
in
november
and
could
not
be
changed
as
there
was
no
previous
one
the
house
of
commons
was
not
sitting
in
november
the
question
alluded
to
was
asked
in
the
following
february
this
one
deliberate
lie
of
the
defender
of
the
faith
will
do
as
well
as
quoting
a
score
of
others
to
show
how
wickedly
and
maliciously
he
endeavoured
to
secure
an
unjust
verdict
the
speech
over
a
number
of
witnesses
were
called
sir
hardinge
did
not
call
witnesses
who
knew
the
facts
such
as
norrish
the
shopman
or
whittle
the
printer
these
he
carefully
avoided
although
he
subpoenaed
both
because
he
did
not
want
the
real
facts
to
come
out
but
he
put
in
two
solicitor
clerks
who
had
been
hanging
about
the
premises
and
buying
endless
and
sheaves
of
them
which
were
never
used
but
by
which
sir
hardinge
hoped
to
convey
the
impression
of
a
mass
of
criminality
he
put
in
a
gentleman
from
the
british
museum
who
produced
two
large
books
presumed
to
be
and
what
they
were
brought
for
nobody
understood
the
counsel
for
the
crown
as
little
as
any
one
and
the
judge
surveying
them
over
his
spectacles
treated
them
with
supreme
contempt
as
utterly
irrelevant
then
a
man
came
to
prove
that
bradlaugh
was
rated
for
stonecutter
street
a
fact
no
one
disputed
two
policemen
came
to
say
they
had
seen
him
go
in
you
saw
many
people
go
in
i
suppose
queried
the
lord
chief
justice
on
the
whole
the
most
miserably
weak
and
obviously
malicious
case
that
could
be
brought
into
a
court
of
law
one
witness
however
must
not
be
forgotten
woodhams
bank
manager
when
he
stated
that
maloney
the
junior
counsel
for
the
crown
had
inspected
bradlaugh
banking
account
a
murmur
of
surprise
and
indignation
ran
round
the
court
oh
oh
was
heard
from
the
crowd
of
barristers
behind
the
judge
looked
down
incredulously
and
for
a
moment
the
examination
was
stopped
by
the
general
movement
unless
sir
hardinge
giffard
is
a
splendid
actor
he
was
not
aware
of
the
infamous
proceeding
for
he
looked
as
startled
as
the
rest
of
his
legal
brethren
another
queer
incident
occurred
showing
perhaps
more
than
aught
else
bradlaugh
swift
perception
of
the
situation
and
adaptation
to
the
environment
he
wanted
to
read
the
mansion
house
deposition
of
norrish
to
show
why
he
was
not
called
the
judge
objected
and
declined
to
allow
it
to
be
read
a
pause
while
you
might
count
five
then
well
i
think
i
may
say
the
learned
counsel
did
not
call
norrish
because
and
then
the
whole
substance
of
the
deposition
was
given
in
supposititious
form
the
judge
looked
down
a
minute
and
then
went
off
into
silent
laughter
impossible
to
control
at
the
adroit
change
of
means
and
persistent
gaining
of
end
barristers
all
round
broke
into
ripples
of
laughter
unrestrained
a
broad
smile
pervaded
the
jury
box
the
only
unmoved
person
was
the
defendant
who
proceeded
in
his
grave
statement
as
to
what
norrish
might
have
been
asked
the
nature
of
the
defence
was
very
clearly
stated
by
bradlaugh
i
shall
ask
you
to
find
that
this
prosecution
is
one
of
the
steps
in
a
vindictive
attempt
to
oppress
and
to
crush
a
political
opponent
that
it
was
a
struggle
that
commenced
on
my
return
to
parliament
in
if
the
prosecutor
had
gone
into
the
box
i
should
have
shown
you
that
he
was
one
of
the
first
then
in
the
house
to
use
the
suggestion
of
blasphemy
against
me
there
since
then
i
have
never
had
any
peace
until
the
monday
of
this
week
writs
for
penalties
have
been
served
and
suits
of
all
kinds
have
been
taken
against
me
on
monday
last
the
house
of
lords
cleared
me
from
the
whole
of
one
set
and
gentlemen
i
ask
you
to
clear
me
from
another
three
times
i
have
been
by
my
constituents
and
what
sir
henry
tyler
asks
you
to
do
is
to
send
me
to
them
branded
with
the
dishonour
of
a
conviction
branded
not
with
the
conviction
for
publishing
heresy
but
branded
with
the
conviction
dishonourable
to
me
of
having
lied
in
this
matter
i
have
no
desire
to
have
a
prison
walls
closed
on
me
but
i
would
sooner
ten
times
that
than
that
my
constituents
should
think
that
for
one
moment
i
lied
to
escape
the
penalties
i
am
not
indicted
for
anything
i
have
ever
written
or
caused
to
be
written
as
my
lord
at
the
very
first
stage
this
morning
pointed
out
it
is
no
question
with
me
are
the
matters
indicted
blasphemous
or
are
they
not
blasphemous
are
they
defensible
or
are
they
not
defensible
that
is
not
my
duty
here
on
this
i
make
no
comment
i
have
no
duty
here
of
even
discussing
the
policy
of
the
blasphemy
laws
although
i
can
not
help
thinking
that
if
i
were
here
making
my
defence
against
them
i
might
say
that
they
were
bad
laws
unfairly
revived
doing
more
mischief
to
those
who
revive
them
than
to
those
whom
they
are
revived
against
but
it
is
not
for
anything
i
have
said
myself
it
is
not
for
anything
i
have
written
myself
it
is
not
for
anything
i
have
published
myself
it
is
an
endeavour
to
make
me
technically
liable
for
a
publication
with
which
i
have
nothing
whatever
to
do
and
i
will
ask
you
to
defeat
that
here
every
time
i
have
succeeded
i
have
been
met
with
some
new
thing
when
i
first
fought
it
was
hoped
to
defeat
my
election
when
i
was
it
was
sought
to
make
me
bankrupt
by
enormous
penalties
and
when
i
escaped
the
suit
for
enormous
penalties
they
hope
now
to
destroy
me
by
this
i
have
no
question
here
about
defending
my
heresy
not
because
i
am
not
ready
to
defend
it
when
it
is
challenged
in
the
right
way
and
it
there
be
anything
in
it
that
the
law
can
challenge
i
have
never
gone
back
from
anything
i
have
ever
said
i
have
never
gone
back
from
anything
i
have
ever
written
i
have
never
gone
back
from
anything
i
have
ever
done
and
i
ask
you
not
to
allow
this
sir
henry
whatley
tyler
who
dares
not
come
here
to
use
you
as
the
assassin
uses
the
dagger
to
stab
a
man
from
behind
whom
he
never
dares
to
face
the
summing
up
by
lord
coleridge
was
perfect
in
eloquence
in
thought
in
feeling
nothing
more
touching
could
be
imagined
than
the
conflict
between
the
real
religious
feeling
abhorrent
of
heresy
and
the
determination
to
be
just
despite
all
prejudice
the
earnest
effort
lest
the
prejudice
he
felt
as
a
christian
should
weigh
also
in
the
minds
of
the
jury
and
should
cause
them
to
pervert
justice
the
absolute
pleading
to
them
to
do
what
was
right
and
not
to
admit
against
the
unbeliever
what
they
would
not
admit
in
ordinary
cases
then
the
protest
against
prosecution
of
opinions
the
admission
of
the
difficulties
in
the
hebrew
scriptures
and
the
pathetic
fear
lest
by
persecution
the
sacred
truths
might
be
struck
through
the
sides
of
those
who
are
their
enemies
for
intellectual
clearness
and
moral
elevation
this
exquisite
piece
of
eloquence
delivered
in
a
voice
of
silvery
beauty
would
be
hard
to
excel
and
lord
coleridge
did
this
piece
of
service
to
the
religion
so
dear
to
his
heart
that
he
showed
that
a
christian
judge
could
be
just
and
righteous
in
dealing
with
a
foe
of
his
creed
there
was
a
time
of
terrible
strain
waiting
for
the
verdict
and
when
at
last
it
came
not
guilty
a
sharp
clap
of
applause
hailed
it
sternly
and
rightly
reproved
by
the
judge
it
was
echoed
by
the
country
which
almost
unanimously
condemned
the
prosecution
as
an
iniquitous
attempt
on
the
part
of
bradlaugh
political
enemies
to
put
a
stop
to
his
political
career
thus
the
mall
wrote
whatever
may
be
the
personal
or
political
or
religious
aversion
which
is
excited
by
bradlaugh
it
is
impossible
for
even
his
bitterest
opponents
to
deny
the
brilliance
of
the
series
of
victories
which
he
has
won
in
the
law
courts
his
acquittal
in
the
blasphemy
prosecution
of
saturday
was
but
the
latest
of
a
number
of
encounters
in
which
he
has
succeeded
in
turning
the
tables
upon
his
opponents
in
the
most
decisive
fashion
the
policy
of
baiting
bradlaugh
which
has
been
persisted
in
so
long
savours
so
strongly
of
a
petty
and
malignant
species
of
persecution
that
it
is
well
that
those
who
indulge
in
it
should
be
made
to
smart
for
their
pains
the
wise
and
weighty
words
used
by
the
lord
chief
justice
in
summing
up
should
be
taken
seriously
to
heart
persons
are
to
be
deprecated
who
would
pervert
the
law
even
with
the
best
intentions
and
do
evil
that
good
may
come
whose
damnation
says
the
apostle
is
just
without
emulating
the
severity
of
the
apostle
we
may
say
that
it
is
satisfactory
that
the
promoters
of
all
these
prosecutions
should
be
condemned
in
costs
in
the
separate
trial
of
foote
and
ramsey
foote
again
defended
himself
in
a
speech
of
marked
ability
and
spoken
of
by
the
judge
as
very
striking
lord
coleridge
made
a
noble
charge
to
the
jury
in
which
he
strongly
condemned
prosecutions
of
unpopular
opinions
pointing
out
that
no
prosecution
short
of
extermination
could
be
effective
and
caustically
remarking
on
the
very
easy
form
of
virtue
indulged
in
by
persecutors
as
a
general
rule
he
said
persecution
unless
far
more
extreme
than
in
england
in
the
nineteenth
century
is
possible
is
certain
to
be
in
vain
it
is
also
true
and
i
can
not
help
assenting
to
it
that
it
is
a
very
easy
form
of
virtue
it
is
a
more
difficult
form
of
virtue
quietly
and
unostentatiously
to
obey
what
we
believe
to
be
god
will
in
our
own
lives
it
is
not
very
easy
to
do
it
and
it
makes
much
less
noise
in
the
world
it
is
very
easy
to
turn
upon
somebody
else
who
differs
from
us
and
in
the
guise
of
zeal
of
god
honour
to
attack
somebody
of
a
difference
of
opinion
whose
life
may
be
more
pleasing
to
god
and
more
conducive
to
his
honour
than
our
own
and
when
it
is
done
by
persons
whose
own
lives
are
not
free
from
reproach
and
who
take
that
particular
form
of
zeal
for
god
which
consists
in
putting
the
criminal
law
in
force
against
others
that
no
doubt
does
more
to
create
a
sympathy
with
the
defendant
than
with
the
prosecutor
and
if
it
should
be
done
by
those
who
enjoy
the
wit
of
voltaire
and
who
do
not
turn
away
from
the
sneers
of
gibbon
and
rather
relish
the
irony
of
hume
our
feelings
do
not
go
with
the
prosecutors
and
we
are
rather
disposed
to
sympathise
with
the
defendant
it
is
still
worse
if
the
person
who
takes
such
a
course
takes
it
not
from
a
kind
of
notion
that
god
wants
his
assistance
and
that
he
can
give
it
less
on
his
own
account
than
by
prosecuting
others
but
it
is
mixed
up
with
anything
of
partisan
or
political
feeling
then
nothing
can
be
more
foreign
to
what
is
or
religious
or
noble
in
men
conduct
and
indeed
it
seems
to
me
that
any
one
who
will
do
that
not
for
the
honour
of
god
but
for
the
purpose
of
the
ban
deserves
the
most
disdainful
disapprobation
the
jury
disagreed
and
a
was
entered
the
net
results
of
the
trials
were
a
large
addition
to
the
membership
of
the
national
secular
society
an
increase
of
circulation
of
freethought
literature
the
raising
of
foote
for
a
time
to
a
position
of
great
influence
and
popularity
and
the
placing
of
his
name
in
history
as
a
brave
martyr
for
liberty
of
speech
the
offence
against
good
taste
will
be
forgotten
the
loyalty
to
conviction
and
to
courage
will
remain
history
does
not
ask
if
men
who
suffered
for
heresy
ever
published
a
rough
word
it
asks
were
they
brave
in
their
steadfastness
were
they
faithful
to
the

be
well

foote
punishment
for
blasphemy
he
spent
hours
out
of
the
alone
in
his
cell
his
only
seat
was
a
stool
without
a
back
his
employment
was
picking
matting
his
bed
was
a
plank
with
a
thin
mattress

the
latter
part
of
his
imprisonment

chapter
xiii
socialism
the
rest
of
passed
in
the
usual
way
of
hard
work
the
affirmation
bill
was
rejected
and
the
agitation
for
constitutional
right
grew
steadily
the
liberal
press
was
won
over
and
bradlaugh
was
beginning
to
earn
golden
opinions
on
all
sides
for
his
courage
his
tenacity
and
his
a
successful
international
congress
at
amsterdam
took
some
of
us
over
to
the
northern
venice
where
a
most
successful
gathering
was
held
to
me
personally
the
year
has
a
special
interest
as
being
the
one
in
which
my
attention
was
called
though
only
partially
to
the
socialist
movement
i
had
heard
louise
michelle
lecture
in
the
early
spring
a
brief
controversy
in
the
had
interested
me
but
i
had
not
yet
concerned
myself
with
the
economic
basis
of
socialism
i
had
realised
that
the
land
should
be
public
property
but
had
not
gone
into
the
deeper
economic
causes
of
poverty
though
the
question
was
pressing
with
force
on
heart
and
brain
of
socialist
teaching
i
knew
nothing
having
studied
only
the
older
english
economists
in
my
younger
days
in
a
more
definite
call
to
consider
these
teachings
was
to
come
and
i
may
perhaps
open
the
record
of
with
the
words
of
greeting
spoken
by
me
to
our
readers
in
the
first
number
of
the
for
that
year
what
tests
may
have
for
our
courage
what
strains
on
our
endurance
what
trials
of
our
loyalty
none
can
tell
but
this
we
know
that
every
test
of
courage
successfully
met
every
strain
of
endurance
steadily
borne
every
trial
of
loyalty
nobly
surmounted
leaves
courage
braver
endurance
stronger
loyalty
truer
than
each
was
before
and
therefore
for
our
own
and
for
the
world
sake
i
will
not
wish
you
friends
an
in
which
there
shall
be
no
toil
and
no
battling
but
i
will
wish
you
each
and
all
the
hero
heart
and
the
hero
patience
in
the
struggle
for
the
world
raising
that
will
endure
through
the
coming
year
on
february
i
came
for
the
first
time
across
a
paper
called
in
which
bradlaugh
was
attacked
and
which
gave
an
account
of
a
meeting
of
the
democratic
federation
not
yet
the
social
democratic
in
which
a
man
had
apparently
unrebuked
said
that
all
means
were
justifiable
to
attain
ends
i
protested
strongly
against
the
advocacy
of
criminal
means
declaring
that
those
who
urged
the
use
of
such
means
were
the
worst
foes
of
social
progress
a
few
weeks
later
the
repeated
a
speech
of
hyndman
in
which
a
bloodier
revolution
than
that
of
france
was
prophesied
and
the
extinction
of
seemed
coupled
with
the
success
of
socialism
and
this
again
i
commented
on
but
i
had
the
pleasure
a
week
later
of
reprinting
from
a
sensible
paragraph
condemning
the
advocacy
of
violence
so
long
as
free
agitation
was
allowed
the
spring
was
marked
by
two
events
on
which
i
have
not
time
or
space
to
dwell
the
resignation
by
bradlaugh
of
his
seat
on
the
reiteration
of
the
resolution
of
exclusion
and
his
triumphant
return
for
the
fourth
time
by
an
increased
majority
a
vote
of
a
higher
poll
than
that
of
the
general
election
and
the
release
of
foote
on
february
from
holloway
whence
he
was
escorted
by
a
procession
a
quarter
of
a
mile
in
length
on
the
of
march
he
and
his
received
a
magnificent
reception
and
were
presented
with
valuable
testimonials
at
the
hall
of
science
taking
up
again
the
thread
of
socialism
the
great
debate
in
james
hall
london
between
bradlaugh
and
hyndman
on
april
roused
me
to
a
serious
study
of
the
questions
raised
socialism
has
in
england
no
more
devoted
no
more
advocate
than
henry
hyndman
a
man
of
wide
and
deep
reading
wielding
most
ably
a
singularly
fascinating
pen
with
talents
that
would
have
made
him
wealthy
in
any
career
he
adopted
he
has
sacrificed
himself
without
a
murmur
to
the
people
cause
he
has
borne
obloquy
from
without
suspicion
and
unkindness
from
those
he
served
and
surrounded
by
temptations
to
betray
the
people
he
has
never
swerved
from
his
integrity
he
has
said
rash
things
has
been
stirred
to
passionate
outbursts
and
reckless
phrases
but
love
to
the
people
and
sympathy
with
suffering
lay
at
the
root
of
his
wildest
words
and
they
count
but
little
as
against
his
faithful
service
personally
my
debt
to
him
is
of
a
mixed
character
he
kept
me
from
socialism
for
some
time
by
his
bitter
and
very
unjust
antagonism
to
bradlaugh
but
it
was
the
debate
at
james
hall
that
while
i
angrily
resented
his
injustice
made
me
feel
that
there
was
something
more
in
practical
socialism
than
i
had
imagined
especially
when
i
read
it
over
afterwards
away
from
the
magic
of
bradlaugh
commanding
eloquence
and
personal
magnetism
it
was
a
sore
pity
that
english
socialists
from
the
outset
of
their
movement
treated
bradlaugh
so
unfairly
so
that
his
friends
were
set
against
socialists
ere
they
began
to
examine
their
arguments
i
must
confess
that
my
deep
attachment
to
him
led
me
into
injustice
to
his
socialist
foes
in
those
early
days
and
often
made
me
ascribe
to
them
calculated
malignity
instead
of
hasty
and
prejudiced
assertion
added
to
this
their
uncurbed
violence
in
discussion
their
constant
interruptions
during
the
speeches
of
opponents
their
reckless
inaccuracy
in
matters
of
fact
were
all
bars
standing
in
the
way
of
the
thoughtful
when
i
came
to
know
them
better
i
found
that
the
bulk
of
their
speakers
were
very
young
men
overworked
and
underpaid
who
spent
their
scanty
leisure
in
efforts
to
learn
to
educate
themselves
to
train
themselves
and
i
learned
to
pardon
faults
which
grew
out
of
the
bitter
sense
of
injustice
and
which
were
due
largely
to
the
terrible
pressure
of
our
system
on
characters
not
yet
strong
enough
how
few
are
strong
enough
to
bear
grinding
injustice
without
loss
of
balance
and
of
impartiality
none
save
those
who
have
worked
with
them
know
how
much
of
real
nobility
of
heroic
of
constant
of
brotherly
affection
there
is
among
the
social
democrats
at
this
time
also
i
met
george
bernard
shaw
one
of
the
most
brilliant
of
socialist
writers
and
most
provoking
of
men
a
man
with
a
perfect
genius
for
aggravating
the
enthusiastically
earnest
and
with
a
passion
for
representing
himself
as
a
scoundrel
on
my
first
experience
of
him
on
the
platform
at
south
place
institute
he
described
himself
as
a
loafer
and
i
gave
an
angry
snarl
at
him
in
the
for
a
loafer
was
my
detestation
and
behold
i
found
that
he
was
very
poor
because
he
was
a
writer
with
principles
and
preferred
starving
his
body
to
starving
his
conscience
that
he
gave
time
and
earnest
work
to
the
spreading
of
socialism
spending
night
after
night
in
workmen
clubs
and
that
a
loafer
was
only
an
amiable
way
of
describing
himself
because
he
did
not
carry
a
hod
of
course
i
had
to
apologise
for
my
sharp
criticism
as
doing
him
a
serious
injustice
but
privately
felt
somewhat
injured
at
having
been
entrapped
into
such
a
blunder
meanwhile
i
was
more
and
more
turning
aside
from
politics
and
devoting
myself
to
the
social
condition
of
the
people
i
find
myself
in
june
protesting
against
sir
john
bill
which
fixed
a
day
as
the
limit
of
a
young
person
toil
a
of
twelve
hours
is
brutal
i
wrote
if
the
law
fixes
twelve
hours
as
a
day
that
law
will
largely
govern
custom
i
declare
that
a
day
should
be
eight
hours
on
five
days
in
the
week
and
not
more
than
five
hours
on
the
sixth
if
the
labour
is
of
an
exhausting
character
these
hours
are
too
long
on
every
side
now
the
socialist
controversy
grew
and
i
listened
read
and
thought
much
but
said
little
the
inclusion
of
john
robertson
in
the
staff
of
the
brought
a
highly
intellectual
socialist
into
closer
touch
with
us
and
slowly
i
found
that
the
case
for
socialism
was
intellectually
complete
and
ethically
beautiful
the
trend
of
my
thought
was
shown
by
urging
the
feeding
of
board
school
children
breaking
down
under
the
combination
of
education
and
starvation
and
i
asked
why
should
people
be
pauperised
by
a
meal
and
not
pauperised
by
police
drainage
c
socialism
in
its
splendid
ideal
appealed
to
my
heart
while
the
economic
soundness
of
its
basis
convinced
my
head
all
my
life
was
turned
towards
the
progress
of
the
people
the
helping
of
man
and
it
leaped
forward
to
meet
the
stronger
hope
the
lofty
ideal
of
social
brotherhood
the
rendering
possible
to
all
of
freer
life
so
long
had
i
been
striving
thitherward
and
here
there
opened
up
a
path
to
the
goal
how
strong
were
the
feelings
surging
in
my
heart
may
be
seen
in
a
brief
extract
from
an
article
published
second
week
of
january
christian
charity
we
know
its
work
it
gives
a
of
coal
and
five
pounds
of
beef
once
a
year
to
a
family
whose
head
could
earn
a
hundred
such
doles
if
christian
justice
allowed
him
fair
wage
for
the
work
he
performs
it
plunders
the
workers
of
the
wealth
they
make
and
then
flings
back
at
them
a
thousandth
part
of
their
own
product
as
it
builds
hospitals
for
the
poor
whom
it
has
poisoned
in
filthy
courts
and
alleys
and
workhouses
for
the
creatures
from
whom
it
has
wrung
every
energy
every
hope
every
joy
miss
cobbe
summons
us
to
admire
christian
civilisation
and
we
see
idlers
flaunting
in
the
robes
woven
by
the
toilers
a
glittering
tinselled
founded
on
the
tears
the
strugglings
the
grey
hopeless
misery
of
the
poor
this
first
month
of
january
brought
on
me
the
first
attack
for
my
socialistic
tendencies
from
the
pen
of
ball
who
wrote
to
the
complaining
of
my
paragraph
quoted
above
in
which
i
had
advocated
meals
for
board
school
children
a
brief
controversy
thus
arose
in
which
i
supported
my
opinion
waiving
the
question
as
to
my
being
at
heart
a
socialist
in
truth
i
dreaded
to
make
the
plunge
of
publicly
allying
myself
with
the
advocates
of
socialism
because
of
the
attitude
of
bitter
hostility
they
had
adopted
towards
bradlaugh
on
his
strong
tenacious
nature
nurtured
on
individualism
the
arguments
of
the
younger
generation
made
no
impression
he
could
not
change
his
methods
because
a
new
tendency
was
rising
to
the
surface
and
he
did
not
see
how
different
was
the
socialism
of
our
day
to
the
socialist
dreams
of
the
past
noble
ideals
of
a
future
not
immediately
realisable
in
truth
but
to
be
worked
towards
and
rendered
possible
in
the
days
to
come
could
i
take
public
action
which
might
bring
me
into
collision
with
the
dearest
of
my
friends
which
might
strain
the
strong
and
tender
tie
so
long
existing
between
us
my
affection
my
gratitude
all
warred
against
the
idea
of
working
with
those
who
wronged
him
so
bitterly
but
the
cry
of
starving
children
was
ever
in
my
ears
the
sobs
of
women
poisoned
in
lead
works
exhausted
in
nail
works
driven
to
prostitution
by
starvation
made
old
and
haggard
by
ceaseless
work
i
saw
their
misery
was
the
result
of
an
evil
system
was
inseparable
from
private
ownership
of
the
instruments
of
wealth
production
that
while
the
worker
was
himself
but
an
instrument
selling
his
labour
under
the
law
of
supply
and
demand
he
must
remain
helpless
in
the
grip
of
the
employing
classes
and
that
trade
combinations
could
only
mean
increased
warfare
necessary
indeed
for
the
time
as
weapons
of
defence
but
meaning
war
not
brotherly
of
all
for
the
good
of
all
a
conflict
which
was
stripped
of
all
covering
a
conflict
between
a
personal
tie
and
a
call
of
duty
could
not
last
long
and
with
a
heavy
heart
i
made
up
my
mind
to
profess
socialism
openly
and
work
for
it
with
all
my
energy
happily
bradlaugh
was
as
tolerant
as
he
was
strong
and
our
private
friendship
remained
unbroken
but
he
never
again
felt
the
same
confidence
in
my
judgment
as
he
felt
before
nor
did
he
any
more
consult
me
on
his
own
policy
as
he
had
done
ever
since
we
first
clasped
hands
a
series
of
articles
in
on
the
redistribution
of
political
power
on
the
evolution
of
society
on
modern
socialism
made
my
position
clear
over
against
those
who
laud
the
present
state
of
society
with
its
unjustly
rich
and
its
unjustly
poor
with
its
palaces
and
its
slums
its
millionaires
and
its
paupers
be
it
ours
to
proclaim
that
there
is
a
higher
ideal
in
life
than
that
of
being
first
in
the
race
for
wealth
most
successful
in
the
scramble
for
gold
be
it
ours
to
declare
steadfastly
that
health
comfort
leisure
culture
plenty
for
every
individual
are
far
more
desirable
than
breathless
struggle
for
existence
furious
trampling
down
of
the
weak
by
the
strong
huge
fortunes
accumulated
out
of
the
toil
of
others
to
be
handed
down
to
those
who
had
done
nothing
to
earn
them
be
it
ours
to
maintain
that
the
greatness
of
a
nation
depends
not
on
the
number
of
its
great
proprietors
on
the
wealth
of
its
great
capitalists
or
the
splendour
of
its
great
nobles
but
on
the
absence
of
poverty
among
its
people
on
the
education
and
refinement
of
its
masses
on
the
universality
of
enjoyment
in
life
enough
for
each
of
work
of
leisure
of
joy
too
little
for
none
too
much
for
none
such
is
the
social
ideal
better
to
strive
after
it
worthily
and
fail
than
to
die
without
striving
for
it
at
all
then
i
differentiated
the
methods
of
the
socialist
and
the
radical
individualist
pleading
for
union
among
those
who
formed
the
wings
of
the
army
of
labour
and
urging
union
of
all
workers
against
the
idlers
for
the
weakness
of
the
people
has
ever
been
in
their
divisions
in
the
readiness
of
each
section
to
turn
its
weapons
against
other
sections
instead
of
against
the
common
foe
all
privileged
classes
when
they
are
attacked
sink
their
differences
and
present
a
serried
front
to
their
assailants
the
people
alone
fight
with
each
other
while
the
battle
between
themselves
and
the
privileged
is
raging
i
strove
as
so
many
others
were
striving
to
sound
in
the
ears
of
the
thoughtless
and
the
careless
the
cry
of
the
sufferings
of
the
poor
endeavouring
to
make
articulate
their
misery
thus
in
a
description
of
edinburgh
slums
came
the
following
i
saw
in
a
which
was
made
by
boarding
up
part
of
a
passage
which
had
no
window
and
in
which
it
was
necessary
to
burn
an
oil
lamp
all
day
thus
adding
to
the
burden
of
the
rent
a
family
of
three
man
wife
and
child
whose
lot
was
hardly
their
own
making
the
man
was
tall
and
bronzed
but
he
was
dying
of
heart
disease
he
could
not
do
hard
work
and
he
was
too
clumsy
for
light
work
so
he
sat
there
after
two
days
fruitless
search
patiently
nursing
his
miserable
scrofulous
baby
in
his
dim
and
narrow
den
the
cases
of
individual
hopeless
suffering
are
heartbreaking
in
one
room
lay
a
dying
child
dying
of
low
fever
brought
on
by
want
of
food
hae
no
faither
sobbed
the
mother
and
for
a
moment
i
did
not
catch
the
meaning
that
the
father
had
left
to
the
mother
all
the
burden
of
a
child
unallowed
by
law
in
another
lay
the
corpse
of
a
mother
with
the
children
round
her
and
women
came
in
to
take
back
to
their
overcrowded
beds
mitherless
bairns
in
yet
another
a
woman
shrunken
and
yellow
crouched
over
a
glimmer
of
fire
i
am
dying
of
cancer
of
the
womb
she
said
with
that
pathetic
resignation
to
the
inevitable
so
common
among
the
poor
i
sat
chatting
for
a
few
minutes
again
deary
she
said
as
i
rose
to
go
gey
dull
sitting
here
the
day
through
the
article
in
which
these
among
other
descriptions
occurred
was
closed
with
the
following
passing
out
of
the
slums
into
the
streets
of
the
town
only
a
few
steps
separating
the
horror
and
the
beauty
i
felt
with
a
vividness
more
intense
than
ever
the
fearful
contrasts
between
the
lots
of
men
and
with
more
pressing
urgency
the
question
seemed
to
ring
in
my
ears
there
no
remedy
must
there
always
be
rich
and
poor
some
say
that
it
must
be
so
that
the
palace
and
the
slum
will
for
ever
exist
as
the
light
and
the
shadow
not
so
do
i
believe
i
believe
that
the
poverty
is
the
result
of
ignorance
and
of
bad
social
arrangements
and
that
therefore
it
may
be
eradicated
by
knowledge
and
by
social
change
i
admit
that
for
many
of
these
adult
dwellers
in
the
slums
there
is
no
hope
poor
victims
of
a
civilisation
that
hides
its
brutality
beneath
a
veneer
of
culture
and
of
grace
for
them
individually
there
is
alas
no
salvation
but
for
their
children
yes
healthy
surroundings
good
food
mental
and
physical
training
plenty
of
play
and
carefully
chosen
work
these
might
save
the
young
and
prepare
them
for
happy
life
but
they
are
being
left
to
grow
up
as
their
parents
were
and
even
when
a
few
hours
of
school
are
given
them
the
home
what
the
education
effects
the
scanty
aid
given
is
generally
begrudged
the
education
is
to
be
but
elementary
as
little
as
possible
is
doled
out
yet
these
children
have
each
one
of
them
hopes
and
fears
possibilities
of
virtue
and
of
crime
a
life
to
be
made
or
marred
we
shower
money
on
generals
and
on
nobles
we
keep
paupers
living
on
the
national
charity
we
squander
wealth
with
both
hands
on
army
and
navy
on
churches
and
palaces
but
we
grudge
every
halfpenny
that
increases
the
education
rate
and
howl
down
every
proposal
to
build
decent
houses
for
the
poor
we
cover
our
heartlessness
and
indifference
with
fine
phrases
about
sapping
the
independence
of
the
poor
and
destroying
their
with
loathsome
hypocrisy
we
repair
a
prince
palace
for
him
and
let
him
live
in
it
without
one
word
about
the
degradation
involved
in
his
thus
living
upon
charity
while
we
refuse
to
the
toiler
by
erecting
decent
buildings
in
which
he
may
live
not
like
the
prince
but
only
paying
a
rent
which
shall
cover
the
cost
of
erection
and
maintenance
instead
of
one
which
gives
a
yearly
profit
to
a
speculator
and
so
year
after
year
the
misery
grows
and
every
great
city
has
on
its
womb
a
cancer
sapping
its
vitality
poisoning
its
every
great
city
is
breeding
in
its
slums
a
race
which
is
reverting
through
the
savage
to
the
brute
a
brute
more
dangerous
in
that
degraded
humanity
has
possibilities
of
evil
in
it
beyond
the
reach
of
the
mere
wild
beast
if
not
for
love
sake
then
for
fear
if
not
for
justice
or
for
human
pity
then
for
sheer
desire
of
i
appeal
to
the
wise
and
to
the
wealthy
to
set
their
hands
to
the
cure
of
social
evil
ere
stolidity
gives
place
to
passion
and
dull
patience
vanishes
before
fury
and
they
at
last
in
some
wild
hour
how
much
the
wretched
dare
because
it
was
less
hotly
antagonistic
to
the
radicals
than
the
two
other
socialist
organisations
i
joined
the
fabian
society
and
worked
hard
with
it
as
a
speaker
and
lecturer
sidney
webb
bernard
shaw
hubert
and
mrs
bland
graham
wallas
these
were
some
of
those
who
gave
time
thought
incessant
work
to
the
popularising
of
socialist
thought
the
spreading
of
sound
economics
the
effort
to
turn
the
workers
energy
toward
social
rather
than
merely
political
reform
we
lectured
at
workmen
clubs
wherever
we
could
gain
a
hearing
till
we
leavened
london
radicalism
with
socialist
thought
and
by
treating
the
radical
as
the
unevolved
socialist
rather
than
as
the
we
gradually
won
him
over
to
socialist
views
we
circulated
questions
to
be
put
to
all
candidates
for
parliamentary
or
other
offices
stirred
up
interest
in
local
elections
educated
men
and
women
into
an
understanding
of
the
causes
of
their
poverty
won
recruits
for
the
army
of
propagandists
from
the
younger
of
the
educated
middle
class
that
the
london
working
classes
are
so
largely
socialist
is
greatly
due
to
the
years
of
work
done
among
them
by
members
of
the
fabian
society
as
well
to
the
splendid
if
occasionally
too
militant
energy
of
the
social
democratic
federation
and
to
the
devotion
of
that
noble
and
generous
genius
william
morris
during
this
same
year
a
movement
was
set
on
foot
in
england
to
draw
attention
to
the
terrible
sufferings
of
the
russian
political
prisoners
and
it
was
decided
at
a
meeting
held
in
my
house
to
form
a
society
of
the
friends
of
russia
which
should
seek
to
spread
accurate
and
careful
information
about
the
present
condition
of
russia
at
that
meeting
were
present
charles
bradlaugh
stepniak
and
many
others
pease
acting
as
honorary
secretary
it
is
noteworthy
that
some
of
the
most
prominent
russian
exiles
such
as
kropotkin
take
the
view
that
the
tzar
himself
is
not
allowed
to
know
what
occurs
and
is
very
largely
the
victim
of
the
bureaucracy
that
surrounds
him
another
matter
that
increased
as
the
months
went
on
was
the
attempt
of
the
police
authorities
to
stop
socialist
speaking
in
the
open
air
christians
freethinkers
salvationists
agitators
of
all
kinds
were
for
the
most
part
left
alone
but
there
was
a
regular
crusade
against
the
socialists
liberal
and
tory
journals
alike
condemned
the
way
in
which
in
dod
street
in
september
the
socialists
meetings
were
attacked
quiet
persistence
was
shown
by
the
promoters
members
of
the
social
democratic
federation
and
they
were
well
supported
by
other
socialists
and
by
the
radical
clubs
i
volunteered
to
speak
on
october
my
first
sunday
in
london
after
the
summoning
and
imprisoning
of
the
speakers
had
commenced
but
the
attitude
of
the
people
was
so
determined
on
the
preceding
sunday
that
all
interference
was
withdrawn
herbert
burrows
stood
for
the
school
board
for
the
tower
hamlets
in
the
november
of
this
year
and
i
find
a
paragraph
in
the
in
which
i
heartily
wished
him
success
especially
as
the
first
candidate
who
had
put
forward
a
demand
for
industrial
education
in
this
as
in
so
many
practical
proposals
socialists
have
led
the
way
he
polled
votes
despite
the
furious
opposition
of
the
clergy
to
him
as
a
freethinker
of
the
publicans
to
him
as
a
teetotaler
of
the
maintainers
of
the
present
social
system
to
him
as
a
socialist
and
his
fight
did
much
to
make
possible
my
own
success
in
with
this
autumn
too
began
in
connection
with
the
struggle
for
the
right
of
meeting
the
helping
of
the
workmen
to
fair
trial
by
providing
of
bail
and
legal
defence
the
first
case
that
i
bailed
out
was
that
of
lewis
lyons
sent
to
gaol
for
two
months
with
hard
labour
by
saunders
of
the
thames
police
court
oh
the
weary
sickening
waiting
in
the
court
for
my
prisoner
the
sordid
vice
the
revolting
details
of
human
depravity
to
which
my
unwilling
eyes
and
ears
were
witnesses
i
carried
lyons
off
in
triumph
and
the
middlesex
magistrates
quashed
the
conviction
the
evidence
being
pronounced
by
them
to
be
confusing
contradictory
and
worthless
yet
but
for
the
chance
of
one
of
us
stepping
forward
to
offer
bail
and
to
provide
the
means
for
an
appeal
i
acted
on
bradlaugh
suggestion
and
advice
for
he
acted
as
counsellor
to
me
all
through
the
weary
struggles
that
lasted
till
putting
his
great
legal
knowledge
at
my
disposal
though
he
often
disapproved
my
action
thinking
me
quixotic
but
for
this
lewis
lyons
would
have
had
to
suffer
his
heavy
sentence
the
general
election
took
place
this
autumn
and
northampton
returned
bradlaugh
for
the
fifth
time
thus
putting
an
end
to
the
long
struggle
for
he
took
the
oath
and
his
seat
in
the
following
january
and
at
once
gave
notice
of
an
oaths
bill
to
give
to
all
who
claimed
it
under
all
circumstances
the
right
to
affirm
he
was
returned
with
the
largest
vote
ever
polled
for
him
and
he
entered
parliament
with
all
the
prestige
of
his
great
struggle
and
went
to
the
front
at
once
one
of
the
recognised
forces
in
the
house
the
action
of
speaker
peel
promptly
put
an
end
to
an
attempted
obstruction
sir
michael
hicks
beach
cecil
raikes
and
sir
john
hennaway
had
written
to
the
speaker
asking
his
interference
but
the
speaker
declared
that
he
had
no
authority
no
right
to
stand
between
a
duly
elected
member
and
the
duty
of
taking
the
oath
prescribed
by
statute
thus
ended
the
constitutional
struggle
of
six
years
that
left
the
victor
bankrupt
in
health
and
in
purse
and
sent
him
to
a
comparatively
early
grave
he
lived
long
enough
to
justify
his
election
to
prove
his
value
to
the
house
and
to
his
country
but
he
did
not
live
long
enough
to
render
to
england
all
the
services
which
his
long
training
his
wide
knowledge
his
courage
and
his
honesty
so
eminently
fitted
him
to
yield
illustration
norwich
branch
of
the
socialist
league
now
served
as
a
valuable
aid
in
socialist
propaganda
and
its
monthly
socialist
notes
became
a
record
of
socialist
progress
in
all
lands
we
were
busy
during
the
spring
in
organising
a
conference
for
the
discussion
of
the
present
commercial
system
and
the
better
utilisation
of
national
wealth
for
the
benefit
of
the
community
and
this
was
successfully
held
at
south
place
institute
on
june
the
three
days
being
given
respectively
to
the
utilisation
of
land
the
utilisation
of
capital
and
the
democratic
policy
on
the
bradlaugh
spoke
on
the
utilisation
of
waste
lands
arguing
that
in
a
thickly
populated
country
no
one
had
the
right
to
keep
cultivable
land
uncultivated
and
that
where
land
was
so
kept
there
should
be
compulsory
expropriation
the
state
taking
the
land
and
letting
it
out
to
cultivating
tenants

the
other
speakers

sidney

john

william
saunders
donnisthorpe
edward
aveling
charlotte

fenwick
miller
hubert
bland
pankhurst
and
myself
men
and
women
of
many
views
met
to
compare
methods
and
so
help
on
the
cause
of
social
regeneration
bitter
attacks
were
made
on
me
for
my
socialist
advocacy
by
some
of
the
radicals
in
the
freethought
party
and
looking
back
i
find
myself
condemned
as
a
saint
athanasius
in
petticoats
and
as
possessing
a
mind
like
a
this
same
courteous
critic
remarked
i
have
heard
besant
described
as
being
like
most
women
at
the
mercy
of
her
last
male
acquaintance
for
her
views
on
economics
i
was
foolish
enough
to
break
a
lance
in
with
this
assailant
not
having
then
learned
that
was
a
waste
of
time
that
might
be
better
employed
in
doing
work
for
others
i
certainly
should
not
now
take
the
trouble
to
write
such
a
paragraph
as
the
following
the
moment
a
man
uses
a
woman
sex
to
discredit
her
arguments
the
thoughtful
reader
knows
that
he
is
unable
to
answer
the
arguments
themselves
but
really
these
silly
sneers
at
woman
ability
have
lost
their
force
and
are
best
met
with
a
laugh
at
the
stupendous
of
the
writer
i
may
add
that
such
shafts
are
specially
pointless
against
myself
a
woman
who
thought
her
way
out
of
christianity
and
whiggism
into
freethought
and
radicalism
absolutely
alone
who
gave
up
every
old
friend
male
and
female
rather
than
resign
the
beliefs
she
had
struggled
to
in
solitude
who
again
in
embracing
active
socialism
has
run
counter
to
the
views
of
her
nearest
friends
such
a
woman
may
very
likely
go
wrong
but
i
think
she
may
venture
without
conceit
to
at
least
claim
independence
of
judgment
i
did
not
make
the
acquaintance
of
one
of
my
present
socialist
comrades
male
or
female
until
i
had
embraced
socialism
a
foolish
paragraph
as
are
all
and
a
mischievous
one
as
all
retort
breeds
fresh
strife
but
not
yet
had
come
the
that
estimates
the
judgments
of
others
at
their
true
value
that
recks
not
of
praise
and
blame
not
yet
had
i
learned
that
evil
should
not
be
met
with
evil
wrath
with
wrath
not
yet
were
the
words
of
the
buddha
the
law
to
which
i
strove
to
render
obedience
hatred
ceases
not
by
hatred
at
any
time
hatred
ceases
by
love
the
year
was
a
terrible
one
for
labour
everywhere
reductions
of
wages
everywhere
increase
of
the
numbers
of
the
unemployed
turning
over
the
pages
of
i
see
socialist
notes
filled
month
after
month
with
a
monotonous
tale
there
is
a
reduction
of
wages
at
such
and
such
a
place
so
many
men
have
been
discharged
at
owing
to
the
slackness
of
trade
our
hearts
sank
lower
and
lower
as
summer
passed
into
autumn
and
the
coming
winter
threatened
to
add
to
starvation
the
bitter
pains
of
cold
the
agitation
for
the
eight
hours
day
increased
in
strength
as
the
unemployed
grew
more
numerous
week
by
week
we
ca
stand
it
a
sturdy
quiet
fellow
had
said
to
me
during
the
preceding
winter
flesh
and
blood
ca
stand
it
and
two
months
of
this
bitter
cold
too
we
may
as
well
starve
idle
as
starve
working
had
said
another
with
a
fierce
laugh
and
a
spirit
of
sullen
discontent
was
spreading
everywhere
discontent
that
was
wholly
justified
by
facts
but
ah
how
patient
they
were
for
the
most
part
how
sadly
pathetically
patient
this
crucified
christ
humanity
wrongs
that
would
set
my
heart
and
my
tongue
afire
would
be
accepted
as
a
matter
of
course
o
blind
and
mighty
people
how
my
heart
went
out
to
you
trampled
on
abused
derided
asking
so
little
and
needing
so
much
so
pathetically
grateful
for
the
pettiest
services
so
loving
and
so
loyal
to
those
who
offered
you
but
their
poor
services
and
helpless
love
deeper
and
deeper
into
my
innermost
nature
ate
the
growing
desire
to
succour
to
suffer
for
to
save
i
had
long
given
up
my
social
reputation
i
now
gave
up
with
surrender
ease
comfort
time
the
passion
of
pity
grew
stronger
and
stronger
fed
by
each
new
sacrifice
and
each
sacrifice
led
me
nearer
and
nearer
to
the
threshold
of
that
gateway
beyond
which
stretched
a
path
of
renunciation
i
had
never
dreamed
of
which
those
might
tread
who
were
ready
wholly
to
strip
off
self
for
man
sake
who
for
love
sake
would
surrender
love
return
from
those
they
served
and
would
go
out
into
the
darkness
for
themselves
that
they
might
with
their
own
souls
as
fuel
feed
the
light
of
the
world
as
the
suffering
deepened
with
the
darkening
months
the
meetings
of
the
unemployed
grew
in
number
and
the
murmurs
of
discontent
became
louder
the
social
democratic
federation
carried
on
an
outdoor
agitation
not
without
making
blunders
being
composed
of
human
beings
but
with
abundant
courage
and
the
policy
of
breaking
up
socialist
meetings
went
on
while
other
meetings
were
winked
at
and
john
williams
a
fiery
speaker
but
a
man
with
a
record
of
pathetic
struggle
and
patient
heroism
was
imprisoned
for
two
months
for
speaking
in
the
open
air
and
so
nearly
starved
in
gaol
that
he
came
out
with
his
health
broken
for
life
dawned
the
year
that
was
to
close
so
stormily
and
socialists
everywhere
were
busying
themselves
on
behalf
of
the
unemployed
urging
vestries
to
provide
remunerative
work
for
those
applying
for
relief
assailing
the
local
government
board
with
practicable
proposals
for
utilising
the
productive
energies
of
the
unemployed
circulating
suggestions
to
municipalities
and
other
local
representative
bodies
urging
remedial
measures
a
four
days
oral
debate
with
foote
and
a
written
debate
with
bradlaugh
occupied
some
of
my
energies
and
helped
in
the
process
of
education
to
which
public
opinion
was
being
subjected
both
these
debates
were
largely
circulated
as
pamphlets
a
series
of
afternoon
debates
between
representative
speakers
was
organised
at
south
place
institute
and
corrie
grant
and
myself
had
a
lively
discussion
i
affirming
that
the
existence
of
classes
who
live
upon
unearned
incomes
is
detrimental
to
the
welfare
of
the
community
and
ought
to
be
put
an
end
to
by
legislation
another
debate
in
this
very
quarrelsome
spring
of
was
a
written
one
in
the
between
the
rev
handel
rowe
and
myself
on
the
proposition
is
atheism
logically
tenable
and
is
there
a
satisfactory
atheistic
system
for
the
guidance
of
human
conduct
and
so
the
months
went
on
and
the
menace
of
misery
grew
louder
and
louder
till
in
september
i
find
myself
writing
this
one
thing
is
clear
society
must
deal
with
the
unemployed
or
the
unemployed
will
deal
with
society
stormier
and
stormier
becomes
the
social
outlook
and
they
at
least
are
not
the
worst
enemies
of
society
who
seek
to
find
some
way
through
the
breakers
by
which
the
ship
of
the
commonwealth
may
pass
into
quiet
waters
some
amusement
turned
up
in
the
shape
of
a
charing
cross
parliament
in
which
we
debated
with
much
vigour
the
burning
questions
of
the
day
we
organised
a
compact
socialist
party
defeated
a
liberal
government
took
the
reins
of
office
and
after
a
queen
speech
in
which
her
majesty
addressed
her
loyal
commons
with
a
plainness
of
speech
never
before
or
since
heard
from
the
throne
we
brought
in
several
bills
of
a
decidedly
heroic
character
bernard
shaw
as
president
of
the
local
government
board
and
i
as
home
secretary
came
in
for
a
good
deal
of
criticism
in
connection
with
various
drastic
measures
an
international
freethought
congress
held
in
london
entailed
fairly
heavy
work
and
the
science
classes
were
ever
with
us
another
written
debate
came
with
october
this
time
on
the
teachings
of
christianity
making
the
fifth
of
these
set
discussions
held
by
me
during
the
year
this
same
month
brought
a
change
painful
but
just
i
resigned
my
position
as
of
the
reformer
and
the
number
for
october
bore
charles
bradlaugh
name
alone
the
change
did
not
affect
my
work
on
the
paper
but
i
became
merely
a
subordinate
though
remaining
of
course
joint
proprietor
the
reason
can
not
be
more
accurately
given
than
in
the
paragraph
penned
at
the
time
for
a
considerable
time
past
and
lately
in
increasing
number
complaints
have
reached
me
from
various
quarters
of
the
inconvenience
and
uncertainty
that
result
from
the
divided
editorial
policy
of
this
paper
on
the
question
of
socialism
some
months
ago
i
proposed
to
avoid
this
difficulty
by
resigning
my
share
in
the
editorship
but
my
colleague
with
characteristic
liberality
asked
me
to
let
the
proposal
stand
over
and
see
if
matters
would
not
adjust
themselves
but
the
difficulty
instead
of
disappearing
has
only
become
more
pressing
and
we
both
feel
that
our
readers
have
a
right
to
demand
that
it
be
solved
when
i
became
of
this
paper
i
was
not
a
socialist
and
although
i
regard
socialism
as
the
necessary
and
logical
outcome
of
the
radicalism
which
for
so
many
years
the
has
taught
still
as
in
avowing
myself
a
socialist
i
have
taken
a
distinct
step
the
partial
separation
of
my
policy
in
labour
questions
from
that
of
my
colleague
has
been
of
my
own
making
and
not
of
his
and
it
is
therefore
for
me
to
go
away
over
by
far
the
greater
part
of
our
sphere
of
action
we
are
still
substantially
agreed
and
are
likely
to
remain
so
but
since
as
socialism
becomes
more
and
more
a
question
of
practical
politics
differences
of
theory
tend
to
produce
differences
in
conduct
and
since
a
political
paper
must
have
a
single
editorial
programme
in
practical
politics
it
would
obviously
be
most
inconvenient
for
me
to
retain
my
position
as
i
therefore
resume
my
former
position
as
contributor
only
thus
clearing
the
of
all
responsibility
for
the
views
i
hold
to
this
bradlaugh
added
the
following
i
need
hardly
add
to
this
how
very
deeply
i
regret
the
necessity
for
besant
resignation
of
the
joint
editorship
of
this
journal
and
the
real
grief
i
feel
in
accepting
this
break
in
a
position
in
which
she
has
rendered
such
enormous
service
to
the
freethought
and
radical
cause
as
a
most
valued
contributor
i
trust
the
may
never
lose
the
efficient
aid
of
her
brain
and
pen
for
thirteen
years
this
paper
has
been
richer
for
good
by
the
measure
of
her
and
most
useful
work
i
agree
with
her
that
a
journal
must
have
a
distinct
editorial
policy
and
i
think
this
distinctness
the
more
necessary
when
as
in
the
present
case
every
contributor
has
the
greatest
freedom
of
expression
i
recognise
in
the
fullest
degree
the
spirit
of
in
which
the
lines
to
which
i
add
these
words
have
been
penned
by
besant
charles
bradlaugh
it
was
a
wrench
this
breaking
of
a
tie
for
which
a
heavy
price
had
been
paid
thirteen
years
before
but
it
was
just
any
one
who
makes
a
change
with
which
pain
is
connected
is
bound
in
honour
and
duty
to
take
that
pain
as
much
as
possible
on
himself
he
must
not
put
his
sacrifice
on
others
nor
pay
his
own
ransom
with
their
coin
there
must
be
honour
kept
in
the
life
that
reaches
towards
the
ideal
for
broken
faith
to
that
is
the
only
real
infidelity
and
there
was
another
reason
for
the
change
that
i
dared
not
name
to
him
for
his
quick
loyalty
would
then
have
made
him
stubbornly
determined
against
change
i
saw
the
swift
turning
of
public
opinion
the
gradual
approach
to
him
among
liberals
who
had
hitherto
held
aloof
and
i
knew
that
they
looked
upon
me
as
a
clog
and
a
burden
and
that
were
i
less
prominently
with
him
his
way
would
be
the
easier
to
tread
so
i
slipped
more
and
more
into
the
background
no
longer
went
with
him
to
his
meetings
my
use
to
him
in
public
was
over
for
i
had
become
hindrance
instead
of
help
while
he
was
outcast
and
hated
i
had
the
pride
of
standing
at
his
side
when
all
the
friends
came
buzzing
round
him
i
served
him
best
by
and
i
never
loved
him
better
than
when
i
stood
aside
but
i
continued
all
the
literary
work
unaltered
and
no
change
of
opinions
touched
his
kindness
to
me
although
when
a
little
later
i
joined
the
theosophical
society
he
lost
his
trust
in
my
reasoning
powers
and
judgment
in
this
same
month
of
october
the
unemployed
began
walking
in
procession
through
the
streets
and
harshness
on
the
part
of
the
police
led
to
some
rioting
sir
charles
warren
thought
it
his
duty
to
dragoon
london
meetings
after
the
fashion
of
continental
prefects
with
the
inevitable
result
that
an
grew
up
between
the
people
and
the
police
at
last
we
formed
a
socialist
defence
association
in
order
to
help
poor
workmen
brought
up
and
sentenced
on
police
evidence
only
without
any
chance
being
given
them
of
proper
legal
defence
and
i
organised
a
band
of
men
and
women
who
promised
to
obey
a
telegraphic
summons
night
or
day
and
to
bail
out
any
prisoner
arrested
for
exercising
the
ancient
right
of
walking
in
procession
and
speaking
to
take
one
instance
burleigh
the
war
correspondent
and
winks
were
arrested
and
run
in
with
knight
a
workman
for
seditious
language
i
went
down
to
the
to
offer
bail
for
the
latter
howard
accepted
bail
for
burleigh
and
winks
but
refused
it
for
knight
the
next
day
at
the
the
preposterous
bail
of
was
demanded
for
knight
and
supplied
by
my
faithful
band
and
on
the
next
hearing
poland
solicitor
to
the
treasury
withdrew
the
charge
against
him
for
lack
of
evidence
then
came
the
closing
of
trafalgar
square
and
the
unexpected
and
order
that
cost
some
men
their
lives
many
their
liberty
and
hundreds
the
most
serious
injuries
the
metropolitan
radical
federation
had
called
a
meeting
for
november
to
protest
against
the
imprisonment
of
and
as
matthews
from
his
place
in
the
house
had
stated
that
there
was
no
intention
of
interfering
with
political
meetings
the
radical
clubs
did
not
expect
police
interference
on
november
sir
charles
warren
had
issued
an
order
forbidding
all
meetings
in
the
square
but
the
clubs
trusted
the
promise
of
the
home
secretary
on
saturday
evening
only
november
when
all
arrangements
were
completed
did
he
issue
a
peremptory
order
forbidding
processions
within
a
certain
area
with
this
trap
suddenly
sprung
upon
them
the
delegates
from
the
clubs
the
fabian
society
the
social
democratic
federation
and
the
socialist
league
met
on
that
same
saturday
evening
to
see
to
any
details
that
had
been
possibly
left
unsettled
it
was
finally
decided
to
go
to
the
square
as
arranged
and
if
challenged
by
the
police
to
protest
formally
against
the
illegal
interference
then
to
break
up
the
processions
and
leave
the
members
to
find
their
own
way
to
the
square
it
was
also
decided
to
go
sunday
after
sunday
to
the
square
until
the
right
of
public
meetings
was
vindicated
the
procession
i
was
in
started
from
clerkenwell
green
and
walked
with
its
banner
in
front
and
the
chosen
speakers
including
myself
immediately
behind
the
flag
as
we
were
moving
slowly
and
quietly
along
one
of
the
narrow
streets
debouching
on
trafalgar
square
wondering
whether
we
should
be
challenged
there
was
a
sudden
charge
and
without
a
word
the
police
were
upon
us
with
uplifted
truncheons
the
banner
was
struck
down
and
men
and
women
were
falling
under
a
hail
of
blows
there
was
no
attempt
at
resistance
the
people
were
too
much
astounded
at
the
unprepared
attack
they
scattered
leaving
some
of
their
number
on
the
ground
too
much
injured
to
move
and
then
made
their
way
in
twos
and
threes
to
the
square
it
was
garrisoned
by
police
drawn
up
in
serried
rows
that
could
only
have
been
broken
by
a
deliberate
charge
our
orders
were
to
attempt
no
violence
and
we
attempted
none
cunninghame
graham
and
john
burns
tried
to
pass
through
the
police
and
were
savagely
cut
about
the
head
and
arrested
then
ensued
a
scene
to
be
remembered
the
horse
police
charged
in
squadrons
at
a
rolling
men
and
women
over
like
ninepins
while
the
foot
police
struck
recklessly
with
their
truncheons
cutting
a
road
through
the
crowd
that
closed
immediately
behind
them
i
got
on
a
waggonette
and
tried
to
persuade
the
driver
to
pull
his
trap
across
one
of
the
roads
and
to
get
others
in
line
so
as
to
break
the
charges
of
the
mounted
police
but
he
was
afraid
and
drove
away
to
the
embankment
so
i
jumped
out
and
went
back
to
the
square
at
last
a
rattle
of
cavalry
and
up
came
the
life
guards
cleverly
handled
but
hurting
none
trotting
their
horses
gently
and
shouldering
the
crowd
apart
and
then
the
scots
guards
with
bayonets
fixed
marched
through
and
occupied
the
north
of
the
square
then
the
people
retreated
as
we
passed
round
the
word
go
home
go
home
the
soldiers
were
ready
to
fire
the
people
unarmed
it
would
have
been
but
a
massacre
slowly
the
square
emptied
and
all
was
still
all
other
processions
were
treated
as
ours
had
been
and
the
injuries
inflicted
were
terrible
peaceable
workmen
who
had
never
dreamed
of
rioting
were
left
with
broken
legs
broken
arms
wounds
of
every
description
one

almost
immediately

a
gallant

rescue

an
air

and
we
kept
together
until
i
saw
the
men
into

omnibus

with

bitter
feelings
now
roused

should
again
arise
we
formed

to

thus
rescued

of

done

and
the
following
paragraph
shows
how
generously
he
could
praise
one
not
acting
on
his
own
lines
as
i
have
on
most
serious
matters
of
principle
recently
differed
very
widely
from
my
brave
and
loyal
and
as
the
difference
has
been
regrettably
emphasised
by
her
resignation
of
her
editorial
functions
on
this
journal
it
is
the
more
necessary
that
i
should
say
how
thoroughly
i
approve
and
how
grateful
i
am
to
her
for
her
conduct
in
not
only
obtaining
bail
and
providing
legal
assistance
for
the
helpless
unfortunates
in
the
hands
of
the
police
but
also
for
her
daily
personal
attendance
and
wise
conduct
at
the
and
where
she
has
done
so
much
to
abate
harsh
treatment
on
the
one
hand
and
rash
folly
on
the
other
while
i
should
not
have
marked
out
this
as
fitting
woman
work
especially
in
the
recent
very
inclement
weather
i
desire
to
record
my
view
that
it
has
been
bravely
done
well
done
and
most
usefully
done
and
i
wish
to
mark
this
the
more
emphatically
as
my
views
and
those
of
besant
seem
wider
apart
than
i
could
have
deemed
possible
on
many
of
the
points
of
principle
underlying
what
is
every
day
growing
into
a
most
serious
struggle
ever
did
i
find
charles
bradlaugh
thus
tolerant
of
difference
of
opinion
generously
eager
to
approve
what
to
him
seemed
right
even
in
a
policy
he
disapproved
the
indignation
grew
and
grew
the
police
were
silently
boycotted
but
the
people
were
so
persistent
and
so
tactful
that
no
excuse
for
violence
was
given
until
the
strain
on
the
police
force
began
to
tell
and
the
tory
government
felt
that
london
was
being
hopelessly
alienated
so
at
last
sir
charles
warren
fell
and
a
wiser
hand
was
put
at
the
helm
chapter
xiv
through
storm
to
peace
out
of
all
this
turmoil
and
stress
rose
a
brotherhood
that
had
in
it
the
promise
of
a
fairer
day
stead
and
i
had
become
close
friends
he
christian
i
atheist
burning
with
one
common
love
for
man
one
common
hatred
against
oppression
and
so
in
for
february
i
wrote
lately
there
has
been
dawning
on
the
minds
of
men
far
apart
in
questions
of
theology
the
idea
of
founding
a
new
brotherhood
in
which
service
of
man
should
take
the
place
erstwhile
given
to
service
of
god
a
brotherhood
in
which
work
should
be
worship
and
love
should
be
baptism
in
which
none
should
be
regarded
as
alien
who
was
willing
to
work
for
human
good
one
day
as
i
was
walking
towards
millbank
gaol
with
the
rev
headlam
on
the
way
to
liberate
a
prisoner
i
said
to
him
headlam
we
ought
to
have
a
new
church
which
should
include
all
who
have
the
common
ground
of
faith
in
and
love
for
man
and
a
little
later
i
found
that
my
friend
stead
editor
of
the
mall
gazette
had
long
been
brooding
over
a
similar
thought
and
wondering
whether
men
not
be
persuaded
to
be
as
earnest
about
making
this
world
happy
as
they
are
over
saving
their
souls
the
teaching
of
social
duty
the
upholding
of
social
righteousness
the
building
up
of
a
true
commonwealth
such
would
be
among
the
aims
of
the
church
of
the
future
is
the
hope
too
fair
for
realisation
is
the
winning
of
such
beatific
vision
yet
once
more
the
dream
of
the
enthusiast
but
surely
the
one
fact
that
persons
so
deeply
differing
in
theological
creeds
as
those
who
have
been
toiling
for
the
last
three
months
to
aid
and
relieve
the
oppressed
can
work
in
absolute
harmony
side
by
side
for
the
one
end
surely
this
proves
that
there
is
a
bond
which
is
stronger
than
our
antagonisms
a
unity
which
is
deeper
than
the
speculative
theories
which
divide
how
unconsciously
i
was
marching
towards
the
theosophy
which
was
to
become
the
glory
of
my
life
groping
blindly
in
the
darkness
for
that
very
brotherhood
definitely
formulated
on
these
very
lines
by
those
elder
brothers
of
our
race
at
whose
feet
i
was
so
soon
to
throw
myself
how
deeply
this
longing
for
something
loftier
than
i
had
yet
found
had
wrought
itself
into
my
life
how
strong
the
conviction
was
growing
that
there
was
something
to
be
sought
to
which
the
service
of
man
was
the
road
may
be
seen
in
the
following
passage
from
the
same
article
it
has
been
thought
that
in
these
days
of
factories
and
of
tramways
of
shoddy
and
of
adulteration
that
all
life
must
tread
with
even
rhythm
of
measured
footsteps
and
that
the
glory
of
the
ideal
could
no
longer
glow
over
the
greyness
of
a
modern
horizon
but
signs
are
not
awanting
that
the
breath
of
the
older
heroism
is
beginning
to
stir
men
breasts
and
that
the
passion
for
justice
and
for
liberty
which
thrilled
through
the
veins
of
the
world
greatest
in
the
past
and
woke
our
pulses
to
responsive
throb
has
not
yet
died
wholly
out
of
the
hearts
of
men
still
the
quest
of
the
holy
grail
exercises
its
deathless
fascination
but
the
seekers
no
longer
raise
eyes
to
heaven
nor
search
over
land
and
sea
for
they
know
that
it
waits
them
in
the
suffering
at
their
doors
that
the
consecration
of
the
holiest
is
on
the
agonising
masses
of
the
poor
and
the
despairing
the
cup
is
crimson
with
the
blood
of
the
the
speechless
christ
if
there
be
a
faith
that
can
remove
the
mountains
of
ignorance
and
evil
it
is
surely
that
faith
in
the
ultimate
triumph
of
right
in
the
final
enthronement
of
justice
which
alone
makes
life
worth
the
living
and
which
gems
the
blackest
cloud
of
depression
with
the
arch
of
an
immortal
hope
as
a
step
towards
bringing
about
some
such
union
of
those
ready
to
work
for
man
stead
and
i
projected
the
a
halfpenny
weekly
the
spirit
of
which
was
described
in
its
motto
taken
from
victor
hugo
the
people
are
silence
i
will
be
the
advocate
of
this
silence
i
will
speak
for
the
dumb
i
will
speak
of
the
small
to
the
great
and
of
the
feeble
to
the
strong
i
will
speak
for
all
the
despairing
silent
ones
i
will
interpret
this
stammering
i
will
interpret
the
grumblings
the
murmurs
the
tumults
of
crowds
the
complaints
and
all
these
cries
of
beasts
that
through
ignorance
and
through
suffering
man
is
forced
to
utter
i
will
be
the
word
of
the
people
i
will
be
the
bleeding
mouth
whence
the
gag
is
snatched
out
i
will
say
everything
it
announced
its
object
to
be
the
building
up
of
a
new
church
dedicated
to
the
service
of
man
and
what
we
want
to
do
is
to
establish
in
every
village
and
in
every
street
some
man
or
woman
who
will
sacrifice
time
and
labour
as
systematically
and
as
cheerfully
in
the
temporal
service
of
man
as
others
do
in
what
they
believe
to
be
the
service
of
god
week
after
week
we
issued
our
little
paper
and
it
became
a
real
light
in
the
darkness
there
the
petty
injustices
inflicted
on
the
poor
found
voice
there
the
starvation
wages
paid
to
women
found
exposure
there
sweating
was
brought
to
public
notice
a

of
boots
paid
per

for

driven
to
rid
herself
of
life
from

another
part
of
our
work
was
defending
people
from
unjust
landlords
exposing
workhouse
scandals
enforcing
the
employers
liability
act
charles
bradlaugh
truck
act
forming

circles
whose
members
kept
watch
in
their

district
over
cases
of
cruelty
to
children
extortion
insanitary
workshops
sweating
reporting
each
case
to
me
into
this
work
came
herbert
burrows
who
had
joined
hands
with
me
over
the
trafalgar
square
defence
and
who
wrote
some
noble
articles
in
the
a
man
loving
the
people
with
passionate
devotion
hating
oppression
and
injustice
with
equal
passion
working
himself
with
remorseless
energy
breaking
his
heart
over
wrongs
he
could
not
remedy
his
whole
character
once
came
out
in
a
sentence
when
he
was
lying
delirious
and
thought
himself
dying
tell
the
people
how
i
have
loved
them
always
in
our
crusade
for
the
poor
we
worked
for
the
dockers
morning
in
london
alone
to
adult
men
wrote
sidney
webb
will
fight
like
savages
for
permission
to
labour
in
the
docks
for
an
hour
and
of
them
will
fight
in
vain
and
be
turned
workless
away
we
worked
for
children
dinners
if
we
insist
on
these
children
being
educated
is
it
not
necessary
that
they
shall
be
fed
if
not
we
waste
on
them
knowledge
they
can
not
assimilate
and
torture
many
of
them
to
death
poor
waifs
of
humanity
we
drive
them
into
the
school
and
bid
them
learn
and
the
pitiful
wistful
eyes
question
us
why
we
inflict
this
strange
new
suffering
and
bring
into
their
dim
lives
this
new
pang
not
leave
us
alone
the
pathetically
patient
little
faces
why
not
indeed
since
for
these
child
martyrs
of
the
slums
society
has
only
formulas
not
food
we
cried
out
against
cheap
goods
that
meant
sweated
and
therefore
stolen
goods
the
ethics
of
buying
should
surely
be
simply
enough
we
want
a
particular
thing
and
we
do
not
desire
to
obtain
it
either
by
begging
or
by
robbery
but
if
in
becoming
possessed
of
it
we
neither
beg
it
nor
steal
we
must
give
for
it
something
equivalent
in
exchange
so
much
of
our
neighbour
labour
has
been
put
into
the
thing
we
desire
if
we
will
not
yield
him
fair
equivalent
for
that
labour
yet
take
his
article
we
defraud
him
and
if
we
are
not
willing
to
give
that
fair
equivalent
we
have
no
right
to
become
the
owners
of
his
product
this
branch
of
our
work
led
to
a
big
fight
a
fight
most
happy
in
its
results
at
a
meeting
of
the
fabian
society
miss
clementina
black
gave
a
capital
lecture
on
female
labour
and
urged
the
formation
of
a
consumers
league
pledged
only
to
buy
from
shops
certificated
clean
from
unfair
wage
champion
in
the
discussion
that
followed
drew
attention
to
the
wages
paid
by
bryant
may
limited
while
paying
an
enormous
dividend
to
their
shareholders
so
that
the
value
of
the
original
shares
was
quoted
at
herbert
burrows
and
i
interviewed
some
of
the
girls
got
lists
of
wages
of
fines
a
typical
case
is
that
of
a
girl
of
sixteen
a
she
earns
a
week
and
lives
with
a
sister
employed
by
the
same
firm
who
good
money
as
much
as
or
a
week
out
of
the
earnings
a
week
is
paid
for
the
rent
of
one
room
the
child
lives
only
on
bread
and
butter
and
tea
alike
for
breakfast
and
dinner
but
related
with
dancing
eyes
that
once
a
month
she
went
to
a
meal
where
get
coffee
and
bread
and
butter
and
jam
and
marmalade
and
lots
of
it
we
published
the
facts
under
the
title
of
white
slavery
in
london
and
called
for
a
boycott
of
bryant
may
matches
it
is
time
some
one
came
and
helped
us
said
two
girls
to
me
and
i
asked
who
will
help
plenty
of
people
wish
well
to
any
good
cause
but
very
few
care
to
exert
themselves
to
help
it
and
still
fewer
will
risk
anything
in
its
support
one
ought
to
do
it
but
why
should
i
is
the
ever
phrase
of
amiability
one
ought
to
do
it
so
why
i
is
the
cry
of
some
earnest
servant
of
man
eagerly
forward
springing
to
face
some
perilous
duty
between
those
two
sentences
lie
whole
centuries
of
moral
evolution
i
was
promptly
threatened
with
an
action
for
libel
but
nothing
came
of
it
it
was
easier
to
strike
at
the
girls
and
a
few
days
later
fleet
street
was
enlivened
by
the
irruption
of
a
crowd
of
demanding
annie
besant
i
could
speechify
to
in
fleet
street
so
asked
that
a
deputation
should
come
and
explain
what
they
wanted
up
came
three
women
and
told
their
story
they
had
been
asked
to
sign
a
paper
certifying
that
they
were
well
treated
and
contented
and
that
my
statements
were
untrue
they
refused
you
had
spoke
up
for
us
explained
one
and
we
were
going
back
on
you
a
girl
pitched
on
as
their
leader
was
threatened
with
dismissal
she
stood
firm
next
day
she
was
discharged
for
some
trifle
and
they
all
threw
down
their
work
some
of
them
and
then
a
crowd
of
them
started
off
to
me
to
ask
what
to
do
next
if
we
ever
worked
in
our
lives
herbert
burrows
and
i
worked
for
the
next
fortnight
and
a
pretty
hubbub
we
created
we
asked
for
money
and
it
came
pouring
in
we
registered
the
girls
to
receive
strike
pay
wrote
articles
roused
the
clubs
held
public
meetings
got
bradlaugh
to
ask
questions
in
parliament
stirred
up
constituencies
in
which
shareholders
were
members
till
the
whole
country
rang
with
the
struggle
frederick
charrington
lent
us
a
hall
for
registration
sidney
webb
and
others
moved
the
national
liberal
club
to
action
we
led
a
procession
of
the
girls
to
the
house
of
commons
and
interviewed
with
a
deputation
of
them
members
of
parliament
who
them
the
girls
behaved
splendidly
stuck
together
kept
brave
and
bright
all
through
hobart
of
the
social
democratic
federation
shaw
bland
and
oliver
and
headlam
of
the
fabian
society
miss
clementina
black
and
many
another
helped
in
the
heavy
work
the
london
trades
council
finally
consented
to
act
as
arbitrators
and
a
satisfactory
settlement
was
arrived
at
the
girls
went
in
to
work
fines
and
deductions
were
abolished
better
wages
paid
the
union
was
established
still
the
strongest
trades
union
in
england
and
for
years
i
acted
as
secretary
till
under
press
of
other
duties
i
resigned
and
my
work
was
given
by
the
girls
to
thornton
smith
herbert
burrows
became
and
still
is
the
treasurer
for
a
time
there
was
friction
between
the
company
and
the
union
but
it
gradually
disappeared
under
the
influence
of
common
sense
on
both
sides
and
we
have
found
the
manager
ready
to
consider
any
just
grievance
and
to
endeavour
to
remove
it
while
the
company
have
been
liberal
supporters
of
the
working
women
club
at
bow
founded
by
blavatsky
illustration
strike
committee
of
the
matchmakers
union
the
worst
suffering
of
all
was
among
the
thrown
out
of
work
by
the
strike
and
they
were
hard
to
reach
per
gross
of
boxes
and
buy
your
own
string
and
paste
is
not
wealth
but
when
the
work
went
more
rapid
starvation
came
oh
those
trudges
through
the
lanes
and
alleys
round
bethnal
green
junction
late
at
night
when
our
day
work
was
over
children
lying
about
on
shavings
rags
anything
famine
looking
out
of
baby
faces
out
of
women
eyes
out
of
the
tremulous
hands
of
men
heart
grew
sick
and
eyes
dim
and
ever
louder
sounded
the
question
where
is
the
cure
for
sorrow
what
the
way
of
rescue
for
the
world
in
august
i
asked
for
a
it
will
want
a
piano
tables
for
papers
for
games
for
light
literature
so
that
it
may
offer
a
bright
homelike
refuge
to
these
girls
who
now
have
no
real
homes
no
playground
save
the
streets
it
is
not
proposed
to
build
an
with
stern
and
rigid
discipline
and
enforcement
of
prim
behaviour
but
to
open
a
home
filled
with
the
genial
atmosphere
of
cordial
comradeship
and
freedom
the
atmosphere
so
familiar
to
all
who
have
grown
up
in
the
blessed
shelter
of
a
happy
home
so
strange
alas
to
too
many
of
our
east
london
girls
in
the
same
month
of
august
two
years
later
blavatsky
opened
such
a
home
then
came
a
cry
for
help
from
south
london
from
makers
illegally
fined
and
in
many
cases
grievously
mutilated
by
the
of
machinery
then
aid
to
shop
assistants
also
illegally
fined
legal
defences
by
the
score
still
continued
a
vigorous
agitation
for
a
free
meal
for
children
and
for
fair
wages
to
be
paid
by
all
public
bodies
work
for
the
dockers
and
exposure
of
their
wrongs
a
visit
to
the
cradley
heath
speeches
to
them
writing
for
them
a
contest
for
the
school
board
for
the
tower
hamlets
division
and
triumphant
return
at
the
head
of
the
poll
such
were
some
of
the
ways
in
which
the
autumn
days
were
spent
to
say
nothing
of
scores
of
lectures
secularist
labour
socialist
and
scores
of
articles
written
for
the
winning
of
daily
bread
when
the
school
board
work
was
added
i
felt
that
i
had
as
much
work
as
one
woman
strength
could
do
thus
was
ushered
in
the
to
me
year
in
which
i
found
my
way
home
and
had
the
priceless
good
fortune
of
meeting
and
of
becoming
the
pupil
of
blavatsky
ever
more
and
more
had
been
growing
on
me
the
feeling
that
something
more
than
i
had
was
needed
for
the
cure
of
social
ills
the
socialist
position
sufficed
on
the
economic
side
but
where
to
gain
the
inspiration
the
motive
which
should
lead
to
the
realisation
of
the
brotherhood
of
man
our
efforts
to
really
organise
bands
of
unselfish
workers
had
failed
much
indeed
had
been
done
but
there
was
not
a
real
movement
of
devotion
in
which
men
worked
for
love
sake
only
and
asked
but
to
give
not
to
take
where
was
the
material
for
the
nobler
social
order
where
the
hewn
stones
for
the
building
of
the
temple
of
man
a
great
despair
would
oppress
me
as
i
sought
for
such
a
movement
and
found
it
not
illustration
members
of
the
matchmakers
union
not
only
so
but
since
there
had
been
slowly
growing
up
a
conviction
that
my
philosophy
was
not
sufficient
that
life
and
mind
were
other
than
more
than
i
had
dreamed
psychology
was
advancing
with
rapid
strides
hypnotic
experiments
were
revealing
complexities
in
human
consciousness
strange
riddles
of
multiplex
personalities
and
most
startling
of
all
vivid
intensities
of
mental
action
when
the
brain
that
should
be
the
generator
of
thought
was
reduced
to
a
comatose
state
fact
after
fact
came
hurtling
in
upon
me
demanding
explanation
i
was
incompetent
to
give
i
studied
the
obscurer
sides
of
consciousness
dreams
hallucinations
illusions
insanity
into
the
darkness
shot
a
ray
of
light
occult
world
with
its
wonderfully
suggestive
letters
expounding
not
the
supernatural
but
a
nature
under
law
wider
than
i
had
dared
to
conceive
i
added
spiritualism
to
my
studies
experimenting
privately
finding
the
phenomena
indubitable
but
the
spiritualistic
explanation
of
them
incredible
the
phenomena
of
clairvoyance
clairaudience
were
found
to
be
real
under
all
the
rush
of
the
outer
life
already
sketched
these
questions
were
working
in
my
mind
their
answers
were
being
diligently
sought
i
read
a
variety
of
books
but
could
find
little
in
them
that
satisfied
me
i
experimented
in
various
ways
suggested
in
them
and
got
some
to
me
curious
results
i
finally
convinced
myself
that
there
was
some
hidden
thing
some
hidden
power
and
resolved
to
seek
until
i
found
and
by
the
early
spring
of
i
had
grown
desperately
determined
to
find
at
all
hazards
what
i
sought
at
last
sitting
alone
in
deep
thought
as
i
had
become
accustomed
to
do
after
the
sun
had
set
filled
with
an
intense
but
nearly
hopeless
longing
to
solve
the
riddle
of
life
and
mind
i
heard
a
voice
that
was
later
to
become
to
me
the
holiest
sound
on
earth
bidding
me
take
courage
for
the
light
was
near
a
fortnight
passed
and
then
stead
gave
into
my
hands
two
large
volumes
can
you
review
these
my
young
men
all
fight
shy
of
them
but
you
are
quite
mad
enough
on
these
subjects
to
make
something
of
them
i
took
the
books
they
were
the
two
volumes
of
the
secret
doctrine
written
by
blavatsky
home
i
carried
my
burden
and
sat
me
down
to
read
as
i
turned
over
page
after
page
the
interest
became
absorbing
but
how
familiar
it
seemed
how
my
mind
leapt
forward
to
presage
the
conclusions
how
natural
it
was
how
coherent
how
subtle
and
yet
how
intelligible
i
was
dazzled
blinded
by
the
light
in
which
disjointed
facts
were
seen
as
parts
of
a
mighty
whole
and
all
my
puzzles
riddles
problems
seemed
to
disappear
the
effect
was
partially
illusory
in
one
sense
in
that
they
all
had
to
be
slowly
unravelled
later
the
brain
gradually
assimilating
that
which
the
swift
intuition
had
grasped
as
truth
but
the
light
had
been
seen
and
in
that
flash
of
illumination
i
knew
that
the
weary
search
was
over
and
the
very
truth
was
found
i
wrote
the
review
and
asked
stead
for
an
introduction
to
the
writer
and
then
sent
a
note
asking
to
be
allowed
to
call
i
received
the
most
cordial
of
notes
bidding
me
come
and
in
the
soft
spring
evening
herbert
burrows
and
i
for
his
aspirations
were
as
mine
on
this
matter
walked
from
netting
hill
station
wondering
what
we
should
meet
to
the
door
of
lansdowne
road
a
pause
a
swift
passing
through
hall
and
outer
room
through
thrown
back
a
figure
in
a
large
chair
before
a
table
a
voice
vibrant
compelling
my
dear
besant
i
have
so
long
wished
to
see
you
and
i
was
standing
with
my
hand
in
her
firm
grip
and
looking
for
the
first
time
in
this
life
straight
into
the
eyes
of
i
was
conscious
of
a
sudden
leaping
forth
of
my
heart
was
it
recognition
and
then
i
am
ashamed
to
say
a
fierce
rebellion
a
fierce
withdrawal
as
of
some
wild
animal
when
it
feels
a
mastering
hand
i
sat
down
after
some
introductions
that
conveyed
no
ideas
to
me
and
listened
she
talked
of
travels
of
various
countries
easy
brilliant
talk
her
eyes
veiled
her
exquisitely
moulded
fingers
rolling
cigarettes
incessantly
nothing
special
to
record
no
word
of
occultism
nothing
mysterious
a
woman
of
the
world
chatting
with
her
evening
visitors
we
rose
to
go
and
for
a
moment
the
veil
lifted
and
two
brilliant
piercing
eyes
met
mine
and
with
a
yearning
throb
in
the
voice
oh
my
dear
besant
if
you
would
only
come
among
us
i
felt
a
uncontrollable
desire
to
bend
down
and
kiss
her
under
the
compulsion
of
that
yearning
voice
those
compelling
eyes
but
with
a
flash
of
the
old
unbending
pride
and
an
inward
jeer
at
my
own
folly
i
said
a
commonplace
polite
and
turned
away
with
some
inanely
courteous
and
evasive
remark
child
she
said
to
me
long
afterwards
your
pride
is
terrible
you
are
as
proud
as
lucifer
himself
but
truly
i
think
i
never
showed
it
to
her
again
after
that
first
evening
though
it
sprang
up
wrathfully
in
her
defence
many
and
many
a
time
until
i
learned
the
pettiness
and
the
worthlessness
of
all
criticism
and
knew
that
the
blind
were
objects
of
compassion
not
of
scorn
once
again
i
went
and
asked
about
the
theosophical
society
wishful
to
join
but
fighting
against
it
for
i
saw
distinct
and
clear
with
painful
distinctness
indeed
what
that
joining
would
mean
i
had
largely
conquered
public
prejudice
against
me
by
my
work
on
the
london
school
board
and
a
smoother
road
stretched
before
me
whereon
effort
to
help
should
be
praised
not
blamed
was
i
to
plunge
into
a
new
vortex
of
strife
and
make
myself
a
mark
for
ridicule
worse
than
hatred
and
fight
again
the
weary
fight
for
an
unpopular
truth
must
i
turn
against
materialism
and
face
the
shame
of
publicly
confessing
that
i
had
been
wrong
misled
by
intellect
to
ignore
the
soul
must
i
leave
the
army
that
had
battled
for
me
so
bravely
the
friends
who
through
all
brutality
of
social
ostracism
had
held
me
dear
and
true
and
he
the
strongest
and
truest
friend
of
all
whose
confidence
i
had
shaken
by
my
socialism
must
he
suffer
the
pang
of
seeing
his
his
of
whom
he
had
been
so
proud
to
whom
he
had
been
so
generous
go
over
to
the
opposing
hosts
and
leave
the
ranks
of
materialism
what
would
be
the
look
in
charles
eyes
when
i
told
him
that
i
had
become
a
theosophist
the
struggle
was
sharp
and
keen
but
with
none
of
the
anguish
of
old
days
in
it
for
the
soldier
had
now
fought
many
fights
and
was
hardened
by
many
wounds
and
so
it
came
to
pass
that
i
went
again
to
lansdowne
road
to
ask
about
the
theosophical
society
blavatsky
looked
at
me
piercingly
for
a
moment
have
you
read
the
report
about
me
of
the
society
for
psychical
research
no
i
never
heard
of
it
so
far
as
i
know
go
and
read
it
and
if
after
reading
it
you
come
back
well
and
nothing
more
would
she
say
on
the
subject
but
branched
off
to
her
experiences
in
many
lands
i
borrowed
a
copy
of
the
report
read
and
it
quickly
i
saw
how
slender
was
the
foundation
on
which
the
imposing
structure
was
built
the
continual
assumptions
on
which
conclusions
were
based
the
incredible
character
of
the
allegations
and
most
damning
fact
of
all
the
foul
source
from
which
the
evidence
was
derived
everything
turned
on
the
veracity
of
the
coulombs
and
they
were
as
partners
in
the
alleged
frauds
could
i
put
such
against
the
frank
fearless
nature
that
i
had
caught
a
glimpse
of
against
the
proud
fiery
truthfulness
that
shone
at
me
from
the
clear
blue
eyes
honest
and
fearless
as
those
of
a
noble
child
was
the
writer
of
the
secret
doctrine
this
miserable
impostor
this
accomplice
of
tricksters
this
foul
and
loathsome
deceiver
this
conjuror
with
and
sliding
panels
i
laughed
aloud
at
the
absurdity
and
flung
the
report
aside
with
the
righteous
scorn
of
an
honest
nature
that
knew
its
own
kin
when
it
met
them
and
shrank
from
the
foulness
and
baseness
of
a
lie
the
next
day
saw
me
at
the
theosophical
publishing
company
office
at
duke
street
adelphi
where
countess
wachtmeister
one
of
the
lealest
of
friends
was
at
work
and
i
signed
an
application
to
be
admitted
as
fellow
of
the
theosophical
society
on
receiving
my
diploma
i
betook
myself
to
lansdowne
road
where
i
found
alone
i
went
over
to
her
bent
down
and
kissed
her
but
said
no
word
you
have
joined
the
society
yes
you
have
read
the
report
yes
well
i
knelt
down
before
her
and
clasped
her
hands
in
mine
looking
straight
into
her
eyes
my
answer
is
will
you
accept
me
as
your
pupil
and
give
me
the
honour
of
proclaiming
you
my
teacher
in
the
face
of
the
world
her
stern
set
face
softened
the
unwonted
gleam
of
tears
sprang
to
her
eyes
then
with
a
dignity
more
than
regal
she
placed
her
hand
upon
my
head
you
are
a
noble
woman
may
master
bless
you
from
that
day
the
of
may
until
now
two
years
three
and
half
months
after
she
left
her
body
on
may
my
faith
in
her
has
never
wavered
my
trust
in
her
has
never
been
shaken
i
gave
her
my
faith
on
an
imperious
intuition
i
proved
her
true
day
after
day
in
closest
intimacy
living
by
her
side
and
i
speak
of
her
with
the
reverence
due
from
a
pupil
to
a
teacher
who
never
failed
her
with
the
passionate
gratitude
which
in
our
school
is
the
natural
meed
of
the
one
who
opens
the
gateway
and
points
out
the
path
folly
fanaticism
scoffs
the
englishman
of
the
nineteenth
century
be
it
so
i
have
seen
and
i
can
wait
i
have
been
told
that
i
plunged
headlong
into
theosophy
and
let
my
enthusiasm
carry
me
away
i
think
the
charge
is
true
in
so
far
as
the
decision
was
swiftly
taken
but
it
had
been
long
led
up
to
and
realised
the
dreams
of
childhood
on
the
higher
planes
of
intellectual
womanhood
and
let
me
here
say
that
more
than
all
i
hoped
for
in
that
first
plunge
has
been
realised
and
a
certainty
of
knowledge
has
been
gained
on
doctrines
seen
as
true
as
that
swift
flash
of
illumination
i
by
personal
experiment
that
the
soul
exists
and
that
my
soul
not
my
body
is
myself
that
it
can
leave
the
body
at
will
that
it
can
disembodied
reach
and
learn
from
living
human
teachers
and
bring
back
and
impress
on
the
physical
brain
that
which
it
has
learned
that
this
process
of
transferring
consciousness
from
one
range
of
being
as
it
were
to
another
is
a
very
slow
process
during
which
the
body
and
brain
are
gradually
correlated
with
the
subtler
form
which
is
essentially
that
of
the
soul
and
that
my
own
experience
of
it
still
so
imperfect
so
fragmentary
when
compared
with
the
experience
of
the
highly
trained
is
like
the
first
struggles
of
a
child
learning
to
speak
compared
with
the
perfect
oratory
of
the
practised
speaker
that
consciousness
so
far
from
being
dependent
on
the
brain
is
more
active
when
freed
from
the
gross
forms
of
matter
than
when
encased
within
them
that
the
great
sages
spoken
of
by
blavatsky
exist
that
they
wield
powers
and
possess
knowledge
before
which
our
control
of
nature
and
knowledge
of
her
ways
is
but
as
child
play
all
this
and
much
more
have
i
learned
and
i
am
but
a
pupil
of
low
grade
as
it
were
in
the
infant
class
of
the
occult
school
so
the
first
plunge
has
been
successful
and
the
intuition
has
been
justified
this
same
path
of
knowledge
that
i
am
treading
is
open
to
all
others
who
will
pay
the
toll
demanded
at
the
gateway
and
that
toll
is
willingness
to
renounce
everything
for
the
sake
of
spiritual
truth
and
willingness
to
give
all
the
truth
that
is
won
to
the
service
of
man
keeping
back
no
shred
for
self
on
june
in
a
review
of
the
secret
doctrine
in
the
reformer
the
following
passages
occur
and
show
how
swiftly
some
of
the
main
points
of
the
teaching
had
been
grasped
there
is
a
blunder
in
the
statement
that
of
the
seven
modifications
of
matter
science
knows
only
four
and
till
lately
knew
only
three
these
four
are
only
of
the
lowest
plane
after
saying
that
the
englishman
would
be
but
too
likely
to
be
repelled
if
he
only
skimmed
the
book
i
went
on
with
telescope
and
with
microscope
with
scalpel
and
with
battery
western
science
interrogates
nature
adding
fact
to
fact
storing
experience
after
experience
but
coming
ever
to
gulfs
unfathomable
by
its
plummets
to
heights
unscalable
by
its
ladders
wide
and
masterful
in
its
answers
to
the
the
ever
eludes
it
and
causes
remain
enwrapped
in
gloom
eastern
science
uses
as
its
scientific
instrument
the
penetrating
faculties
of
the
mind
alone
and
regarding
the
material
plane
as
illusion
seeks
in
the
mental
and
spiritual
planes
of
being
the
causes
of
the
material
effects
there
too
is
the
only
reality
there
the
true
existence
of
which
the
visible
universe
is
but
the
shadow
it
is
clear
that
from
such
investigations
some
further
mental
equipment
is
necessary
than
that
normally
afforded
by
the
human
body
and
here
comes
the
parting
of
the
ways
between
east
and
west
for
the
study
of
the
material
universe
our
five
senses
aided
by
the
instruments
invented
by
science
may
suffice
for
all
we
can
hear
and
see
taste
and
handle
these
accustomed
servitors
though
often
blundering
are
the
best
available
guides
to
knowledge
but
it
lies
in
the
nature
of
the
case
that
they
are
useless
when
the
investigation
is
to
be
into
modes
of
existence
which
can
not
impress
themselves
on
our
for
instance
what
we
know
as
colour
is
the
vibration
frequency
of
etheric
waves
striking
on
the
retina
of
the
eye
between
certain
definite
limits
trillions
of
blows
from
the
maximum
trillions
from
the
minimum
these
waves
give
rise
in
us
to
the
sensation
which
the
brain
translates
into
colour
why
the
trillion
blows
at
one
end
of
a
nerve
become
at
the
other
end
we
do
not
know
we
chronicle
the
fact
but
can
not
explain
it
but
our
capacity
to
respond
to
the
vibration
can
not
limit
the
vibrational
capacity
of
the
ether
to
the
higher
and
lower
rates
of
vibration
do
not
exist
but
if
our
sense
of
vision
were
more
sensitive
we
should
see
where
now
we
are
blind
following
this
line
of
thought
we
realise
that
matter
may
exist
in
forms
unknown
to
us
in
modifications
to
which
our
senses
are
unable
to
respond
now
steps
in
the
eastern
sage
and
says
which
you
say
be
we
have
developed
and
cultivated
senses
as
much
superior
to
yours
as
your
eye
is
superior
to
that
of
the
we
have
evolved
mental
and
spiritual
faculties
which
enable
us
to
investigate
on
the
higher
planes
of
being
with
as
much
certainty
as
you
are
investigating
on
the
physical
plane
there
is
nothing
in
the
business
any
more
than
your
knowledge
is
supernatural
though
much
above
that
accessible
to
the
fish
we
do
not
speculate
on
these
higher
forms
of
existence
we
them
by
personal
study
just
as
you
know
the
fauna
and
flora
of
your
world
the
powers
we
possess
are
not
supernatural
they
are
latent
in
every
human
being
and
will
be
evolved
as
the
race
progresses
all
that
we
have
done
is
to
evolve
them
more
rapidly
than
our
neighbours
by
a
procedure
as
open
to
you
as
it
was
to
us
matter
is
everywhere
but
it
exists
in
seven
modifications
of
which
you
only
know
four
and
until
lately
only
knew
three
in
those
higher
forms
reside
the
causes
of
which
you
see
the
effects
in
the
lower
and
to
know
these
causes
you
must
develop
the
capacity
to
take
cognisance
of
the
higher
planes
then
followed
a
brief
outline
of
the
cycle
of
evolution
and
i
went
on
what
part
does
man
play
in
this
vast
drama
of
a
universe
needless
to
say
he
is
not
the
only
living
form
in
a
cosmos
which
for
the
most
part
is
uninhabitable
by
him
as
science
has
shown
living
forms
everywhere
on
the
material
plane
races
in
each
drop
of
water
life
throbbing
in
every
leaf
and
blade
so
the
points
to
living
forms
on
higher
planes
of
existence
each
suited
to
its
environment
till
all
space
thrills
with
life
and
nowhere
is
there
death
but
only
change
amid
these
myriads
are
some
evolving
towards
humanity
some
evolving
away
from
humanity
as
we
know
it
divesting
themselves
of
its
grosser
parts
for
man
is
regarded
as
a
sevenfold
being
four
of
these
parts
belonging
to
the
animal
body
and
perishing
at
or
soon
after
death
while
three
form
his
higher
self
his
true
individuality
and
these
persist
and
are
immortal
these
form
the
ego
and
it
is
this
which
passes
through
many
incarnations
learning
life
lesson
as
it
goes
working
out
its
own
redemption
within
the
limits
of
an
inexorable
law
sowing
seeds
of
which
it
ever
reaps
the
harvest
building
its
own
fate
with
tireless
fingers
and
finding
nowhere
in
the
measureless
time
and
space
around
it
any
that
can
lift
for
it
one
weight
it
has
created
one
burden
it
has
gathered
unravel
for
it
one
tangle
it
has
twisted
close
for
it
one
gulf
it
has
digged
then
after
noting
the
approaches
of
western
science
to
eastern
came
the
final
words
it
is
of
curious
interest
to
note
how
some
of
the
latest
theories
seem
to
catch
glimpses
of
the
occult
doctrines
as
though
science
were
standing
on
the
very
threshold
of
knowledge
which
shall
make
all
her
past
seem
small
already
her
hand
is
trembling
towards
the
grasp
of
forces
beside
which
all
those
now
at
her
command
are
insignificant
how
soon
will
her
grip
fasten
on
them
let
us
hope
not
until
social
order
has
been
transformed
lest
they
should
only
give
more
to
those
who
have
and
leave
the
wretched
still
wretcheder
by
force
of
contrast
knowledge
used
by
selfishness
widens
the
gulf
that
divides
man
from
man
and
race
from
race
and
we
may
well
shrink
from
the
idea
of
new
powers
in
nature
being
yoked
to
the
car
of
greed
hence
the
wisdom
of
those
in
whose
name
madame
blavatsky
speaks
has
ever
denied
the
knowledge
which
is
power
until
lesson
has
been
learned
and
has
given
only
into
the
hands
of
the
selfless
the
control
of
those
natural
forces
which
misused
would
wreck
society
this
review
and
the
public
announcement
demanded
by
honesty
that
i
had
joined
the
theosophical
society
naturally
raised
somewhat
of
a
storm
of
criticism
and
the
of
june
contained
the
following
the
review
of
madame
blavatsky
book
in
the
last
and
an
announcement
in
the
have
brought
me
several
letters
on
the
subject
of
theosophy
i
am
asked
for
an
explanation
as
to
what
theosophy
is
and
as
to
my
own
opinion
on
theosophy
the
word
is
old
and
was
used
among
the
from
the
dictionary
its
new
meaning
appears
to
be
who
claims
to
have
a
knowledge
of
god
or
of
the
laws
of
nature
by
means
of
internal
illumination
an
atheist
certainly
can
not
be
a
theosophist
a
deist
might
be
a
theosophist
a
monist
can
not
be
a
theosophist
theosophy
must
at
least
involve
dualism
modern
theosophy
according
to
madame
blavatsky
as
set
out
in
last
issue
asserts
much
that
i
do
not
believe
and
alleges
some
things
that
to
me
are
certainly
not
true
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
of
reading
madame
blavatsky
two
volumes
but
i
have
read
during
the
past
ten
years
many
publications
from
the
pen
of
herself
colonel
olcott
and
of
other
theosophists
they
appear
to
me
to
have
sought
to
rehabilitate
a
kind
of
spiritualism
in
eastern
phraseology
i
think
many
of
their
allegations
utterly
erroneous
and
their
reasonings
wholly
unsound
i
very
deeply
regret
indeed
that
my
colleague
and
has
with
somewhat
of
suddenness
and
without
any
interchange
of
ideas
with
myself
adopted
as
facts
matters
which
seem
to
me
to
be
as
unreal
as
it
is
possible
for
any
fiction
to
be
my
regret
is
greater
as
i
know
besant
devotion
to
any
course
she
believes
to
be
true
i
know
that
she
will
always
be
earnest
in
the
advocacy
of
any
views
she
undertakes
to
defend
and
i
look
to
possible
developments
of
her
theosophic
views
with
the
very
gravest
misgiving
the
editorial
policy
of
this
paper
is
unchanged
and
is
directly
antagonistic
to
all
forms
of
theosophy
i
would
have
preferred
on
this
subject
to
have
held
my
peace
for
the
public
disagreeing
with
besant
on
her
adoption
of
socialism
has
caused
pain
to
both
but
on
reading
her
article
and
taking
the
public
announcement
made
of
her
having
joined
the
theosophical
organisation
i
owe
it
to
those
who
look
to
me
for
guidance
to
say
this
with
clearness
charles
bradlaugh
it
is
not
possible
for
me
here
to
state
fully
my
reasons
for
joining
the
theosophical
society
the
three
objects
of
which
are
to
found
a
universal
brotherhood
without
distinction
of
race
or
creed
to
forward
the
study
of
aryan
literature
and
philosophy
to
investigate
unexplained
laws
of
nature
and
the
physical
powers
latent
in
man
on
matters
of
religious
opinion
the
members
are
absolutely
free
the
founders
of
the
society
deny
a
personal
god
and
a
somewhat
subtle
form
of
pantheism
is
taught
as
the
theosophic
view
of
the
universe
though
even
this
is
not
forced
on
members
of
the
society
i
have
no
desire
to
hide
the
fact
that
this
form
of
pantheism
appears
to
me
to
promise
solution
of
some
problems
especially
problems
in
psychology
which
atheism
leaves
untouched
annie
besant
theosophy
as
its
students
well
know
so
far
from
involving
dualism
is
based
on
the
one
which
becomes
two
on
manifestation
just
as
atheism
posits
one
existence
only
cognisable
in
the
duality
force
and
matter
and
as
philosophic
though
not
popular
theism
teaches
one
deity
whereof
are
spirit
and
matter
bradlaugh
temperate
disapproval
was
not
copied
in
its
temperance
by
some
other
freethought
leaders
and
foote
especially
distinguished
himself
by
the
bitterness
of
his
attacks
in
the
midst
of
the
whirl
i
was
called
away
to
paris
to
attend
with
herbert
burrows
the
great
labour
congress
held
there
from
july
to
july
and
spent
a
day
or
two
at
fontainebleau
with
blavatsky
who
had
gone
abroad
for
a
few
weeks
rest
there
i
found
her
translating
the
wonderful
fragments
from
the
book
of
the
golden
precepts
now
so
widely
known
under
the
name
of
the
voice
of
the
silence
she
wrote
it
swiftly
without
any
material
copy
before
her
and
in
the
evening
made
me
read
it
aloud
to
see
if
the
english
was
decent
herbert
burrows
was
there
and
candler
a
staunch
american
theosophist
and
we
sat
round
while
i
read
the
translation
was
in
perfect
and
beautiful
english
flowing
and
musical
only
a
word
or
two
could
we
find
to
alter
and
she
looked
at
us
like
a
startled
child
wondering
at
our
praises
praises
that
any
one
with
the
literary
sense
would
endorse
if
they
read
that
exquisite
prose
poem
a
little
earlier
in
the
same
day
i
had
asked
her
as
to
the
agencies
at
work
in
producing
the
taps
so
constantly
heard
at
spiritualistic
you
do
use
spirits
to
produce
taps
she
said
see
here
she
put
her
hand
over
my
head
not
touching
it
and
i
heard
and
felt
slight
taps
on
the
bone
of
my
skull
each
sending
a
little
electric
thrill
down
the
spine
she
then
carefully
explained
how
such
taps
were
producible
at
any
point
desired
by
the
operator
and
how
interplay
of
the
currents
to
which
they
were
due
might
be
caused
otherwise
than
by
conscious
human
volition
it
was
in
this
fashion
that
she
would
illustrate
her
verbal
teachings
proving
by
experiment
the
statements
made
as
to
the
existence
of
subtle
forces
controllable
by
the
trained
mind
the
phenomena
all
belonged
to
the
scientific
side
of
her
teaching
and
she
never
committed
the
folly
of
claiming
authority
for
her
philosophic
doctrines
on
the
ground
that
she
was
a
and
constantly
she
would
remind
us
that
there
was
no
such
thing
as
miracle
that
all
the
phenomena
she
had
produced
were
worked
by
virtue
of
a
knowledge
of
nature
deeper
than
that
of
average
people
and
by
the
force
of
a
mind
and
will
some
of
them
were
what
she
would
describe
as
psychological
tricks
the
creation
of
images
by
force
of
imagination
and
in
pressing
them
on
others
as
a
collective
hallucination
others
such
as
the
moving
of
solid
articles
either
by
an
astral
hand
projected
to
draw
them
towards
her
or
by
using
an
elemental
others
by
reading
in
the
astral
light
and
so
on
but
the
proof
of
the
reality
of
her
mission
from
those
whom
she
spoke
of
as
masters
lay
not
in
these
comparatively
trivial
physical
and
mental
phenomena
but
in
the
splendour
of
her
heroic
endurance
the
depth
of
her
knowledge
the
selflessness
of
her
character
the
lofty
spirituality
of
her
teaching
the
untiring
passion
of
her
devotion
the
incessant
ardour
of
her
work
for
the
enlightening
of
men
it
was
these
and
not
her
phenomena
that
won
for
her
our
faith
and
confidence
we
who
lived
beside
her
knowing
her
daily
life
and
we
gratefully
accepted
her
teaching
not
because
she
claimed
any
authority
but
because
it
woke
in
us
powers
the
possibility
of
which
in
ourselves
we
had
not
dreamed
of
energies
of
the
soul
that
demonstrated
their
own
existence
returning
to
london
from
paris
it
became
necessary
to
make
a
very
clear
and
definite
presentment
of
my
change
of
views
and
in
the
of
august
i
find
the
following
many
statements
are
being
made
just
now
about
me
and
my
beliefs
some
of
which
are
absurdly
and
some
of
which
are
maliciously
untrue
i
must
ask
my
friends
not
to
give
credence
to
them
it
would
not
be
fair
to
my
friend
bradlaugh
to
ask
him
to
open
the
columns
of
this
journal
to
an
exposition
of
theosophy
from
my
pen
and
so
bring
about
a
long
controversy
on
a
subject
which
would
not
interest
the
majority
of
the
readers
of
the
this
being
so
i
can
not
here
answer
the
attacks
made
on
me
i
feel
however
that
the
party
with
which
i
have
worked
for
so
long
has
a
right
to
demand
of
me
some
explanation
of
the
step
i
have
taken
and
i
am
therefore
preparing
a
pamphlet
dealing
fully
with
the
question
further
i
have
arranged
with
smith
to
take
as
subject
of
the
lectures
to
be
delivered
by
me
at
the
hall
of
science
on
august
and
i
became
a
theosophist
meanwhile
i
think
that
my
years
of
service
in
the
ranks
of
the
freethought
party
give
me
the
right
to
ask
that
i
should
not
be
condemned
unheard
and
i
even
venture
to
suggest
in
view
of
the
praises
bestowed
on
me
by
freethinkers
in
the
past
that
it
is
possible
that
there
may
be
something
to
be
said
from
the
intellectual
standpoint
in
favour
of
theosophy
the
caricatures
of
it
which
have
appeared
from
some
freethinkers
pens
represent
it
about
as
accurately
as
the
christian
evidence
caricatures
of
atheism
represent
that
dignified
philosophy
of
life
and
remembering
how
much
they
are
themselves
misrepresented
i
ask
them
to
wait
before
they
judge
the
lectures
were
delivered
and
were
condensed
into
a
pamphlet
bearing
the
same
title
which
has
had
a
very
great
circulation
it
closed
as
follows
there
remains
a
great
stumblingblock
in
the
minds
of
many
freethinkers
which
is
certain
to
prejudice
them
against
theosophy
and
which
offers
to
opponents
a
cheap
subject
for
sarcasm
the
assertion
that
there
exist
other
living
beings
than
the
men
and
animals
found
on
our
own
globe
it
may
be
well
for
people
who
at
once
turn
away
when
such
an
assertion
is
made
to
stop
and
ask
themselves
whether
they
really
and
seriously
believe
that
throughout
this
mighty
universe
in
which
our
little
planet
is
but
as
a
tiny
speck
of
sand
in
the
sahara
this
one
planet
only
is
inhabited
by
living
things
is
all
the
universe
dumb
save
for
voices
eyeless
save
for
vision
dead
save
for
life
such
a
preposterous
belief
was
well
enough
in
the
days
when
christianity
regarded
our
world
as
the
centre
of
the
universe
the
human
race
as
the
one
for
which
the
creator
had
deigned
to
die
but
now
that
we
are
placed
in
our
proper
position
one
among
countless
myriads
of
worlds
what
ground
is
there
for
the
preposterous
conceit
which
arrogates
as
ours
all
sentient
existence
earth
air
water
all
are
teeming
with
living
things
suited
to
their
environment
our
globe
is
overflowing
with
life
but
the
moment
we
pass
in
thought
beyond
our
atmosphere
everything
is
to
be
changed
neither
reason
nor
analogy
support
such
a
supposition
it
was
one
of
bruno
crimes
that
he
dared
to
teach
that
other
worlds
than
ours
were
inhabited
but
he
was
wiser
than
the
monks
who
burned
him
all
the
theosophists
aver
is
that
each
phase
of
matter
has
living
things
suited
to
it
and
that
all
the
universe
is
pulsing
with
life
shriek
the
bigoted
it
is
no
more
superstition
than
the
belief
in
bacteria
or
in
any
other
living
thing
invisible
to
the
ordinary
human
eye
is
a
misleading
word
for
historically
it
connotes
immateriality
and
a
supernatural
kind
of
existence
and
the
theosophist
believes
neither
in
the
one
nor
the
other
with
him
all
living
things
act
in
and
through
a
material
basis
and
and
are
not
found
dissociated
but
he
alleges
that
matter
exists
in
states
other
than
those
at
present
known
to
science
to
deny
this
is
to
be
about
as
sensible
as
was
the
hindû
prince
who
denied
the
existence
of
ice
because
water
in
his
experience
never
became
solid
refusal
to
believe
until
proof
is
given
is
a
rational
position
denial
of
all
outside
of
our
own
limited
experience
is
absurd
one
last
word
to
my
secularist
friends
if
you
say
to
me
our
ranks
i
will
leave
them
i
force
myself
on
no
party
and
the
moment
i
feel
myself
unwelcome
i
will
go
it
has
cost
me
pain
enough
and
to
spare
to
admit
that
the
materialism
from
which
i
hoped
all
has
failed
me
and
by
such
admission
to
bring
on
myself
the
disapproval
of
some
of
my
nearest
friends
but
here
as
at
other
times
in
my
life
i
dare
not
purchase
peace
with
a
lie
an
imperious
necessity
forces
me
to
speak
the
truth
as
i
see
it
whether
the
speech
please
or
displease
whether
it
bring
praise
or
blame
that
one
loyalty
to
truth
i
must
keep
stainless
whatever
friendships
fail
me
or
human
ties
be
broken
she
may
lead
me
into
the
wilderness
yet
i
must
follow
her
she
may
strip
me
of
all
love
yet
i
must
pursue
her
though
she
slay
me
yet
will
i
trust
in
her
and
i
ask
no
other
epitaph
on
my
tomb
but
tried
to
follow
truth
meanwhile
with
this
new
controversy
on
my
hands
the
school
board
work
went
on
rendered
possible
i
ought
to
say
by
the
generous
assistance
of
friends
unknown
to
me
who
sent
me
a
year
during
the
last
year
and
a
half
so
also
went
on
the
vigorous
socialist
work
and
the
continual
championship
of
struggling
labour
movements
prominent
here
being
the
organisation
of
the
south
london
into
a
union
and
the
aiding
of
the
movement
for
shortening
the
hours
of
tram
and
men
the
meetings
for
which
had
to
be
held
after
midnight
the
feeding
and
clothing
of
children
also
occupied
much
time
and
attention
for
the
little
ones
in
my
district
were
thousands
of
them
desperately
poor
my
studies
i
pursued
as
best
i
could
reading
in
railway
carriages
tramcars
omnibuses
and
stealing
hours
for
listening
to
by
shortening
the
nights
in
october
bradlaugh
shaken
strength
received
its
though
he
was
to
live
yet
another
fifteen
months
he
collapsed
suddenly
under
a
most
severe
attack
of
congestion
and
lay
in
imminent
peril
devotedly
nursed
by
his
only
remaining
child
bonner
his
elder
daughter
having
died
the
preceding
autumn
slowly
he
struggled
back
to
life
after
four
weeks
in
bed
and
ordered
by
his
physician
to
take
rest
and
if
possible
a
sea
voyage
he
sailed
for
india
on
november
to
attend
the
national
congress
where
he
was
enthusiastically
acclaimed
as
member
for
india
in
november
i
argued
a
libel
suit
brought
by
me
against
the
rev
hoskyns
vicar
of
stepney
who
had
selected
some
vile
passages
from
a
book
which
was
not
mine
and
had
circulated
them
as
representing
my
views
during
the
school
board
election
of
i
had
against
me
the
sir
edward
clarke
at
the
bar
and
baron
huddleston
on
the
bench
both
counsel
and
judge
did
their
best
to
browbeat
me
and
to
use
the
coarsest
language
endeavouring
to
prove
that
by
advocating
the
limitation
of
the
family
i
had
condemned
chastity
as
a
crime
five
hours
of
brutal
left
my
denial
of
such
teachings
unshaken
and
even
the
pleadings
of
the
judge
for
the
clergyman
defending
his
parishioners
against
an
unbeliever
and
his
laying
down
as
law
that
the
statement
was
privileged
did
not
avail
to
win
a
verdict
the
jury
disagreed
not
as
one
of
them
told
me
afterwards
on
the
question
of
the
libel
but
on
some
feeling
that
a
clergyman
ought
not
to
be
mulcted
in
damages
for
his
in
defence
of
his
faith
against
the
ravening
wolf
of
unbelief
while
others
regarding
the
libel
as
a
very
cruel
one
would
not
agree
to
a
verdict
that
did
not
carry
substantial
damages
i
did
not
carry
the
case
to
a
new
trial
feeling
that
it
was
not
worth
while
to
waste
time
over
it
further
my
innocence
of
the
charge
itself
having
been
fully
proved
busily
the
months
rolled
on
and
early
in
the
year
had
given
to
her
to
use
in
her
discretion
for
human
service
and
if
she
thought
well
in
the
service
of
women
after
a
good
deal
of
discussion
she
fixed
on
the
establishment
of
a
club
in
east
london
for
working
girls
and
with
her
approval
miss
laura
cooper
and
i
hunted
for
a
suitable
place
finally
we
fixed
on
a
very
large
and
old
house
bow
road
and
some
months
went
in
its
complete
renovation
and
the
building
of
a
hall
attached
to
it
on
august
it
was
opened
by
madame
blavatsky
and
dedicated
by
her
to
the
brightening
of
the
lot
of
hardworking
and
underpaid
girls
it
has
nobly
fulfilled
its
mission
for
the
last
three
years
very
tender
was
heart
to
human
suffering
especially
to
that
of
women
and
children
she
was
very
poor
towards
the
end
of
her
earthly
life
having
spent
all
on
her
mission
and
refusing
to
take
time
from
her
theosophical
work
to
write
for
the
russian
papers
which
were
ready
to
pay
highly
for
her
pen
but
her
slender
purse
was
swiftly
emptied
when
any
human
pain
that
money
could
relieve
came
in
her
way
one
day
i
wrote
a
letter
to
a
comrade
that
was
shown
to
her
about
some
little
children
to
whom
i
had
carried
a
quantity
of
country
flowers
and
i
had
spoken
of
their
faces
pinched
with
want
the
following
characteristic
note
came
to
me
my
dearest
friend
i
have
just
read
your
letter
to
and
my
heart
is
sick
for
the
poor
little
ones
look
here
i
have
but
of
own
of
which
i
can
dispose
for
as
you
know
i
am
a
pauper
and
proud
of
it
but
i
want
you
to
take
them
and
say
a
this
may
buy
thirty
dinners
for
thirty
poor
little
starving
wretches
and
i
may
feel
happier
for
thirty
minutes
at
the
thought
now
do
say
a
word
and
do
it
take
them
to
those
unfortunate
babies
who
loved
your
flowers
and
felt
happy
forgive
your
old
uncouth
friend
in
this
world
ever
yours
it
was
this
tenderness
of
hers
that
led
us
after
she
had
gone
to
found
the
home
for
little
children
and
one
day
we
hope
to
fulfil
her
expressed
desire
that
a
large
but
homelike
refuge
for
outcast
children
should
be
opened
under
the
auspices
of
the
theosophical
society
the
lease
of
lansdowne
road
expiring
in
the
early
summer
of
it
was
decided
that
avenue
road
should
be
turned
into
the
headquarters
of
the
theosophical
society
in
europe
a
hall
was
built
for
the
meetings
of
the
blavatsky
lodge
the
lodge
founded
by
her
and
various
alterations
made
in
july
her
staff
of
workers
was
united
under
one
roof
thither
came
archibald
and
bertram
keightley
who
had
devoted
themselves
to
her
service
years
before
and
the
countess
wachtmeister
who
had
thrown
aside
all
the
luxuries
of
wealth
and
of
high
social
rank
to
give
all
to
the
cause
she
served
and
the
friend
she
loved
with
deep
and
faithful
loyajty
and
george
mead
her
secretary
and
earnest

more
devoted
bringing
practical
knowledge
to
the
help
of
the
work
and
making
possible
the
large
development
of
our
printing
department
these
with
myself
were
at
first
the
resident
staff
miss
cooper
and
herbert
burrows
who
were
also
identified
with
the
work
being
prevented
by
other
obligations
from
living
always
as
part
of
the
household
the
rules
of
the
house
were
and
are
very
simple
but
insisted
on
great
regularity
of
life
we
breakfasted
at
worked
till
lunch
at
then
again
till
dinner
at
after
dinner
the
outer
work
for
the
society
was
put
aside
and
we
gathered
in
room
where
we
would
sit
talking
over
plans
receiving
instructions
listening
to
her
explanation
of
knotty
points
by
midnight
all
the
lights
had
to
be
extinguished
my
public
work
took
me
away
for
many
hours
unfortunately
for
myself
but
such
was
the
regular
run
of
our
busy
lives
she
herself
wrote
incessantly
always
suffering
but
of
indomitable
will
she
drove
her
body
through
its
tasks
merciless
to
its
weaknesses
and
its
pains
her
pupils
she
treated
very
variously
adapting
herself
with
nicest
accuracy
to
their
differing
natures
as
a
teacher
she
was
marvellously
patient
explaining
a
thing
over
and
over
again
in
different
fashions
until
sometimes
after
prolonged
failure
she
would
throw
herself
back
in
her
chair
my
god
the
easy
mon
dieu
of
the
foreigner
am
i
a
fool
that
you
ca
understand
here
to
some
one
on
whose
countenance
a
faint
gleam
of
comprehension
was
discernible
tell
these
flapdoodles
of
the
ages
what
i
mean
with
vanity
conceit
pretence
of
knowledge
she
was
merciless
if
the
pupil
were
a
promising
one
keen
shafts
of
irony
would
pierce
the
sham
with
some
she
would
get
very
angry
lashing
them
out
of
their
lethargy
with
fiery
scorn
and
in
truth
she
made
herself
a
mere
instrument
for
the
training
of
her
pupils
careless
what
they
or
any
one
else
thought
of
her
providing
that
the
resulting
benefit
to
them
was
secured
and
we
who
lived
around
her
who
in
closest
intimacy
watched
her
day
after
day
we
bear
witness
to
the
unselfish
beauty
of
her
life
the
nobility
of
her
character
and
we
lay
at
her
feet
our
most
reverent
gratitude
for
knowledge
gained
lives
purified
strength
developed
o
noble
and
heroic
soul
whom
the
outside
purblind
world
misjudges
but
whom
your
pupils
partly
saw
never
through
lives
and
deaths
shall
we
repay
the
debt
of
gratitude
we
owe
to
you
and
thus
i
came
through
storm
to
peace
not
to
the
peace
of
an
untroubled
sea
of
outer
life
which
no
strong
soul
can
crave
but
to
an
inner
peace
that
outer
troubles
may
not
avail
to
ruffle
a
peace
which
belongs
to
the
eternal
not
to
the
transitory
to
the
depths
not
to
the
shallows
of
life
it
carried
me
scatheless
through
the
terrible
spring
of
when
death
struck
down
charles
bradlaugh
in
the
plenitude
of
his
usefulness
and
unlocked
the
gateway
into
rest
for
blavatsky
through
anxieties
and
responsibilities
heavy
and
numerous
it
has
borne
me
every
strain
makes
it
stronger
every
trial
makes
it
serener
every
assault
leaves
it
more
radiant
quiet
confidence
has
taken
the
place
of
doubt
a
strong
security
the
place
of
anxious
dread
in
life
through
death
to
life
i
am
but
the
servant
of
the
great
brotherhood
and
those
on
whose
heads
but
for
a
moment
the
touch
of
the
master
has
rested
in
blessing
can
never
again
look
upon
the
world
save
through
eyes
made
luminous
with
the
radiance
of
the
eternal
peace
peace
to
all
beings
