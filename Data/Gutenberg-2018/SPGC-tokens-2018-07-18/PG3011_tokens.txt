preface
when
i
first
saw
osgood
beautiful
illustrated
edition
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
i
asked
him
to
let
me
use
some
of
the
cuts
in
a
cheaper
annotated
edition
for
school
and
household
use
and
the
present
volume
is
the
result
the
text
of
the
poem
has
given
me
unexpected
trouble
when
i
edited
some
of
gray
poems
several
years
ago
i
found
that
they
had
not
been
correctly
printed
for
more
than
half
a
century
but
in
the
case
of
scott
i
supposed
that
the
text
of
black
author
edition
could
be
depended
upon
as
accurate
almost
at
the
start
however
i
detected
sundry
obvious
misprints
in
one
of
the
many
forms
in
which
this
edition
is
issued
and
an
examination
of
others
showed
that
they
were
as
bad
in
their
way
the
shilling
issue
was
no
worse
than
the
costly
illustrated
one
of
which
had
its
own
assortment
of
slips
of
the
type
no
two
editions
that
i
could
obtain
agreed
exactly
in
their
readings
i
tried
in
vain
to
find
a
copy
of
the
editio
princeps
in
cambridge
and
boston
but
succeeded
in
getting
one
through
a
london
bookseller
this
i
compared
line
by
line
with
the
edinburgh
edition
of
from
the
harvard
library
with
lockhart
first
edition
the
globe
edition
and
about
a
dozen
others
english
and
american
i
found
many
misprints
and
corruptions
in
all
except
the
edition
of
and
a
few
even
in
that
for
instance
in
i
scott
wrote
found
in
each
cliff
a
narrow
bower
and
it
is
so
printed
in
the
first
edition
but
in
every
other
that
i
have
seen
cliff
appears
in
place
of
clift
to
the
manifest
injury
of
the
passage
in
ii
every
edition
that
i
have
seen
since
that
of
has
i
meant
not
all
my
heart
might
say
which
is
worse
than
nonsense
the
correct
reading
being
my
heat
in
vi
the
scottish
boune
though
it
occurs
twice
in
other
parts
of
the
poem
has
been
changed
to
bound
in
all
editions
since
and
eight
lines
below
the
old
word
barded
has
become
barbed
scores
of
similar
corruptions
are
recorded
in
my
notes
and
need
not
be
cited
here
i
have
restored
the
reading
of
the
first
edition
except
in
cases
where
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
later
reading
is
the
poet
own
correction
or
alteration
there
are
obvious
misprints
in
the
first
edition
which
scott
himself
overlooked
see
on
ii
vi
etc
and
it
is
sometimes
difficult
to
decide
whether
a
later
reading
a
change
of
a
plural
to
a
singular
or
like
trivial
variation
is
a
misprint
or
the
author
correction
of
an
earlier
misprint
i
have
done
the
best
i
could
with
the
means
at
my
command
to
settle
these
questions
and
am
at
least
certain
that
the
text
as
i
give
it
is
nearer
right
than
in
any
edition
since
as
all
the
variae
lectiones
are
recorded
in
the
notes
the
reader
who
does
not
approve
of
the
one
i
adopt
can
substitute
that
which
he
prefers
i
have
retained
all
scott
notes
a
few
of
them
have
been
somewhat
abridged
and
all
those
added
by
lockhart
my
own
i
have
made
as
concise
as
possible
there
are
of
course
many
of
them
which
many
of
my
readers
will
not
need
but
i
think
there
are
none
that
may
not
be
of
service
or
at
least
of
interest
to
some
of
them
and
i
hope
that
no
one
will
turn
to
them
for
help
without
finding
it
scott
is
much
given
to
the
use
of
elizabethan
words
and
constructions
and
i
have
quoted
many
parallelisms
from
shakespeare
and
his
contemporaries
i
believe
i
have
referred
to
my
edition
of
shakespeare
in
only
a
single
instance
on
iii
but
teachers
and
others
who
have
that
edition
will
find
many
additional
illustrations
in
the
notes
on
the
passages
cited
while
correcting
the
errors
of
former
editors
i
may
have
overlooked
some
of
my
own
i
am
already
indebted
to
the
careful
proofreaders
of
the
university
press
for
the
detection
of
occasional
slips
in
quotations
or
references
and
i
shall
be
very
grateful
to
my
readers
for
a
memorandum
of
any
others
that
they
may
discover

the
scene
of
the

chiefly
in
the

clattered
a
hundred
steeds
along

failing
din

hill

the
heights

roused

now
upon
the
mountain
southern
brow
where
broad
extended
far
beneath
the
varied
realms
of
fair
menteith
with
anxious
eye
he
wandered
mountain
and
meadow
moss
and
moor
and
pondered
refuge
from
his
toil
by
far
lochard
or
aberfoyle
but
nearer
was
the

waved
and

flagged
upon

the
stragglers
following

reached
the
lake
of

when
the
brigg
of

was
won
the
headmost
horseman
rode

alone

with
unbated
zeal

horseman
plied

for

with

with

with

the
hunter
marked
that
mountain
high
the
lone
lake
western
boundary
and
deemed
the
stag
must
turn
to
bay
where
that
huge
rampart
barred
the
way
already
glorying
in
the
prize
measured
his
antlers
with
his
eyes
for
the
and
mustered
his
breath
his
whinyard
drew
but
thundering
as
he
came
prepared
with
ready
arm
and
weapon
bared
the
wily
quarry
shunned
the
shock
and
turned
him
from
the
opposing
rock
then
dashing
down
a
darksome
glen
soon
lost
to
hound
and
hunter
ken
in
the
deep
trosachs
wildest
nook
his
solitary
refuge
took
there
while
close
couched
the
thicket
shed
cold
dews
and
wild
flowers
on
his
head
he
heard
the
baffled
dogs
in
vain
rave
through
the
hollow
pass
amain
chiding
the
rocks
that
yelled
again

close
on
the
hounds
the
hunter
came
to
cheer
them
on
the
vanished
game
but
stumbling
in
the
rugged
dell
the
gallant
horse
exhausted
fell
the
impatient
rider
strove
in
vain
to
rouse
him
with
the
spur
and
rein
for
the
good
steed
his
labors
stretched
his
stiff
limbs
to
rise
no
more
then
touched
with
pity
and
remorse
he
sorrowed
the
expiring
horse
little
thought
when
first
thy
rein
i
slacked
upon
the
banks
of
seine
that
highland
eagle
should
feed
on
thy
fleet
limbs
my
matchless
steed
woe
worth
the
chase
woe
worth
the
day
that
costs
thy
life
my
gallant
gray
x
then
through
the
dell
his
horn
resounds
from
vain
pursuit
to
call
the
hounds
back
limped
with
slow
and
crippled
pace
the
sulky
leaders
of
the
chase
close
to
their
master
side
they
pressed
with
drooping
tail
and
humbled
crest
but
still
the
dingle
hollow
throat
prolonged
the
swelling
the
owlets
started
from
their
dream
the
eagles
answered
with
their
scream
round
and
around
the
sounds
were
cast
till
echo
seemed
an
answering
blast
and
on
the
hunter
tried
his
way
to
join
some
comrades
of
the
day
yet
often
paused
so
strange
the
road
so
wondrous
were
the
scenes
it
showed
xi
the
western
waves
of
ebbing
day
rolled
the
glen
their
level
way
each
purple
peak
each
flinty
spire
was
bathed
in
floods
of
living
fire
but
not
a
setting
beam
could
glow
within
the
dark
ravines
below
where
twined
the
path
in
shadow
hid
round
many
a
rocky
pyramid
shooting
abruptly
from
the
dell
its
pinnacle
round
many
an
insulated
mass
the
native
bulwarks
of
the
pass
huge
as
the
tower

builders
vain
presumptuous
piled
on

fantastically

these
castles

their
shivered
brows

the
unfathomable
glade

a

inlet
still
and
deep
affording
scarce
such
breadth

the
wild
duck
brood
to
swim
lost
for
a

through
thickets

broader

its
channels

the
shaggy
mounds

them
from

retiring
claims
to
be
an

now
to
issue
from

no
pathway
meets

he
climb
with
footing
nice
a
precipice
the
broom
tough
roots
his
ladder
made
the
hazel
saplings

their
aid

thus
an
airy
point
he
won
where
gleaming
with
the
setting
sun
one
burnished
sheet
of
living
gold
loch
katrine
lay
beneath
him
rolled
in
all
her
length
far
winding
lay
with
promontory

islands

empurpled
bright
floated
amid
the
livelier
light

mountains

like
giants
stand
to
sentinel
enchanted
land
high
on
the

huge
benvenue
down
to
the
lake
in
masses
threw
crags
knolls
and
mounds
confusedly
hurled
the
fragments
of
an
earlier
world
a
wildering
forest
feathered
his
ruined
sides

summit
hoar
while
on
the
north
through
middle
air
heaved
high
his
forehead
bare

from
the
steep
promontory
gazed
the
stranger
raptured
and
amazed
and
a
scene
were
here
he
cried
princely
pomp
or
churchman
pride
on
this
bold
brow
a
lordly
tower
in
that
soft
vale
a
lady
bower
on
yonder
meadow
far
away
the
turrets
of
a
cloister

how
blithely
might
the
chide
on
the
lake
the
lingering
morn
how
sweet
at
eve
the
lover
lute
chime
when
the
groves
were
still
and
mute
and
when
the
midnight
moon
should
lave
her
forehead
in
the
silver
wave
how
solemn
on
the
ear
would
come
the
holy
matins
distant
hum
while
the
deep
peal
commanding
tone
should
wake
in
yonder
islet
lone
a
sainted
hermit
from
his
cell
to
drop
a
bead
with
every
knell
and
bugle
lute
and
bell
and
all
should
each
bewildered
stranger
call
to
friendly
feast
and
lighted

merriment

the

that

this

has
been
tried

but
scarce
again
his
horn
he
wound
when
lo
forth
starting
at
the
sound
from
underneath
an
aged
oak
that
slanted
from
the
islet
rock
a
damsel
guider
of
its
way
a
little
skiff
shot
to
the
bay
that
round
the
promontory
steep
led
its
deep
line
in
graceful
sweep
eddying
in
almost
viewless
wave
the
weeping
willow
twig
to
rave
and
kiss
with
whispering
sound
and
slow
the
beach
of
pebbles
bright
as
snow
the
boat
had
touched
this
silver
strand
just
as
the
hunter
left
his
stand
and
stood
concealed
amid
the
brake
to
view
this
lady
of
the
lake
the
maiden
paused
as
if
again
she
thought
to
catch
the
distant
strain
with
head
upraised
and
look
intent
and
eye
and
ear
attentive
bent
and
locks
flung
back
and
lips
apart
like
monument
of
grecian
art
in
listening
mood
she
seemed
to
stand
the
guardian
naiad
of
the
strand
xviii
and
did
grecian
chisel
trace
a
nymph
a
naiad
or
a
grace
of
finer
form
or
lovelier
face
what
though
the
sun
with
ardent
frown
had
slightly
tinged
her
cheek
with
brown
the
sportive
toil
which
short
and
light
had
dyed
her
glowing
hue
so
bright
served
too
in
hastier
swell
to
show
short
glimpses
of
a
breast
of
snow
what
though
no
rule
of
courtly
grace
to
measured
mood
had
trained
her
pace
a
foot
more
light
a
step
more
true
from
the
dashed
the
dew
the
slight
harebell
raised
its
head
elastic
from
her
airy
tread
what
though
upon
her
speech
there
hung
the
accents
of
the
mountain
tongue
those
silver
sounds
so
soft
so
dear
the
listener
held
his
breath
to
hear
xix
a
chieftain
daughter
seemed
the
maid
her
satin
snood
her
silken
plaid
her
golden
brooch
such
birth
betrayed
and
seldom
was
a
snood
amid
such
wild
luxuriant
ringlets
hid
whose
glossy
black
to
shame
might
bring
the
plumage
of
the
raven
wing
and
seldom
a
breast
so
fair
mantled
a
plaid
with
modest
care
and
never
brooch
the
folds
combined
above
a
heart
more
good
and

her
kindness

her
worth

more

the
guileless
movements
of

breast
whether
joy
danced
in
her
dark
eye
or
woe
or
pity
claimed
a
sigh
or
filial
love
was
glowing
there
or
meek
devotion
poured
a
prayer
or
tale
of
injury
called
forth
the
indignant
spirit
of
the
north
one
only
passion
unrevealed
with
maiden
pride
the
maid
concealed
yet
not
less
purely
felt
the
flame
o
need
i
tell
that
passion
name
xx
impatient
of
the
silent
horn
now
on
the
gale
her
voice
was
borne
she
cried
the
rocks
around
loved
to
prolong
the
gentle
sound
awhile
she
paused
no
answer
came
was
thine
the
blast
the
name
less
resolutely
uttered
fell
the
echoes
could
not
catch
the
swell
stranger
i
the
huntsman
said
advancing
from
the
hazel
shade
the
maid
alarmed
with
hasty
oar
pushed
her
light
shallop
from
the
shore
and
when
a
space
was
gained
between
closer
she
drew
her
bosom
screen
so
forth
the
startled
swan
would
swing
so
turn
to
prune
his
ruffled
wing
then
safe
though
fluttered
and
amazed
she
paused
and
on
the
stranger
gazed
not
his
the
form
nor
his
the
eye
that
youthful
maidens
wont
to
fly
xxi
on
his
bold
visage
middle
age
had
slightly
pressed
its
signet
sage
yet
had
not
quenched
the
open
truth
and
fiery
vehemence
of
youth
forward
and
frolic
glee
was
there
the
will
to
do
the
soul
to
dare
the
sparkling
glance
soon
blown
to
fire
of
hasty
love
or
headlong
ire
his
limbs
were
cast
in
manly
could
for
hardy
sports
or
contest
bold
and
though
in
peaceful
garb
arrayed
and
weaponless
except
his
blade
his
stately
mien
as
well
implied
a
heart
a
martial
pride
as
if
a
baron
crest
he
wore
and
sheathed
in
armor
bode
the
shore
slighting
the
petty
need
he
showed
he
told
of
his
benighted
road
his
ready
speech
flowed
fair
and
free
in
phrase
of
gentlest
courtesy
yet
seemed
that
tone
and
gesture
bland
less
used
to
sue
than
to
command

awhile
the
maid
the
stranger
eyed
and
reassured
at
length
replied
that

halls
were
open
still
to

you
unexpected

replied
as

approached

believe
that
before

yet
as

as
yesternight
old
foretold
your

bade
that

i
held
his

deemed

the

with
smile
suppressed
and
sly
the
toil
unwonted
saw
him
try
for
seldom
sure
if
before
his
noble
hand
had
grasped
an

yet
with
main
strength
his
strokes
he
drew

the

the
stranger
viewed
the
shore
around

all
so
close
with
copsewood
bound
nor
track
nor
pathway
might
declare
that
human
foot
frequented
there
until
the
mountain
maiden
showed
a
clambering
unsuspected
road
that
winded
through
the
tangled
screen
and
opened
on
a
narrow
green
where
weeping
birch
and
willow
round
with
their
long
fibres
swept
the
ground
here
for
retreat
in
dangerous
hour
some
chief
had
framed
a
rustic
bower
xxvi
it
was
a
lodge
of
ample
size
but
strange
of
structure
and
device
of
such
materials
as
around
the
workman
hand
had
readiest
found
lopped
of
their
boughs
their

by

rudely
squared
to
give
the
walls
their
destined
height
the
sturdy
oak
and
ash
unite
while
moss
and
clay
and

combined
to
fence
each
crevice
from

wind
the

slender
length
for

spread
and
withered
heath
and
rushes
dry
supplied
a
russet

aloft
on

my

must
be
my
gentle

in

thee
he
crossed
the
threshold
and
a
clang
of
angry
steel
that
instant
rang
to
his
bold
brow
his
spirit
rushed
but
soon
for
vain
alarm
he
blushed
when
on
the
floor
he
saw
displayed
cause
of
the
din
a
naked
blade
dropped
from
the
sheath
that
careless
flung
upon
a

all
to

the

xxviii
the
wondering
stranger
round
him
gazed
and
next
the
fallen
weapon
raised
few
were
the
arms
whose
sinewy
strength
sufficed
to
stretch
it
forth
at
length
and
as
the

he
poised

swayed
never
knew

one

said

brook
to
wield
a

smiled

took
the

the

iv
as
died
the
sounds
upon
the
tide
the
shallop
reached
the
mainland
side
and
ere
his
onward
way
he
took
the
stranger
cast
a
lingering
look
where
easily
his
eye
might
reach
the
harper
on
the
islet
beach
reclined
against
a
blighted
tree
as
wasted
gray
and
worn
as
he
to
minstrel
meditation
given
his
reverend
brow
was
raised
to
heaven
as
from
the
rising
sun
to
claim
a
sparkle
of
inspiring
flame
his
hand
reclined
upon
the
wire
seemed
watching
the
awakening
fire
so
still
he
sat
as
those
who
wait
till
judgment
speak
the
doom
of
fate
so
still
as
if
no
breeze
might
dare
to
lift
one
lock
of
hoary
hair
so
still
as
life
itself
were
fled
in
the
last
sound
his
harp
had
sped
upon
a
rock
with
lichens
wild
beside
him
ellen
sat
and
smiled
she
to
see
the
stately
drake
lead
forth
his
fleet
upon
the
lake
while
her
vexed
spaniel
from
the
beach
bayed
at
the
prize
beyond
his
reach
yet
tell
me
then
the
maid
who
knows
why
deepened
on
her
cheek
the
rose
forgive
forgive
fidelity
perchance
the
maiden
smiled
to
see
yon
parting
lingerer
wave
adieu
and
stop
and
turn
to
wave
anew
and
lovely
ladies
ere
your
ire
condemn
the
heroine
of
my
lyre
show
me
the
fair
would
scorn
to
spy
and
prize
such
conquest
of
her
eve
vi
while
yet
he
loitered
on
the
spot
it
seemed
as
ellen
marked
him
not
but
when
he
turned
him
to
the
glade
one
courteous
parting
sign
she
made
and
after
oft
the
knight
would
say
that
not
when
prize
of
festal
day
was
dealt
him
by
the
brightest
fair
who
wore
jewel
in
her
hair
so
highly
did
his
bosom
swell
as
at
that
simple
mute
farewell
now
with
a
trusty
and
his
dark
by
his
side

parts
the
maid
unconscious
still
watched
him
wind
slowly
round
the
hill
but
when
his
stately
form
was
hid
the
guardian
in
her
bosom
chid
malcolm
vain
and
selfish
maid
was
thus
upbraiding

so
had
malcolm
idly
hung
on
the
smooth
phrase
of
southern
tongue
not
so
had
malcolm
strained
his
eye
another
step
than
thine
to
spy
aloud
she
cried
to
the
old
minstrel
by
her
side
thee
from
thy
moody
dream
i
give
thy
harp
heroic
theme
and
warm
thee
with
a
noble
name
pour
forth
the
glory
of
the
graeme
scarce
from
her
lip
the
word
had
rushed
when
deep
the
conscious
maiden
blushed
for
of
his
clan
in
hall
and
bower
young
malcolm
graeme
was
held
the
flower
vii
the
minstrel
waked
his
harp
three
times
arose
the
martial
chimes
and
thrice
their
high
heroic
pride
in
melancholy
murmurs
died
thou
bidst
o
noble
maid
clasping
his
withered
hands
he
said
thou
bidst
me
wake
the
strain
though
all
unwont
to
bid
in
vain
alas
than
mine
a
mightier
hand
has
tuned
my
harp
my
strings
has
spanned
i
touch
the
chords
of
joy
but
low
and
mournful
answer
notes
of
woe
and
the
proud
march
which
victors
tread
sinks
in
the
wailing
for
the
dead
o
well
for
me
if
mine
alone
that
dirge

tone
if
as
my
tuneful
fathers
said

thus
its

foretell

welcome
be
the
minstrel
knell
viii
ah
dear
lady
thus
it
sighed
the
eve
thy
sainted
mother
died
and
such
the
sounds
which
while
i
strove
to
wake
a
lay
of
war
or
love
came
marring
all
the
festal
mirth
appalling
me
who
gave
them
birth
and
disobedient
to
my
call
wailed
loud
through
bothwell
bannered

ere
douglases
to
ruin
driven
were
exiled
from
their
native

if
yet
worse
mishap
and
woe

must
undergo

aught
but
weal
to
ellen
fair
brood
in
these
accents
of
despair
no

shall
fling
triumph

rapture
from
thy

short
one
final
strain
shall
flow
fraught
with
unutterable
woe
then
shivered
shall
thy
fragments
lie
thy

down
and

stooped
and
looking
round
plucked
a
blue
harebell
from
the
ground
me
whose

scarce
conveys
an
image
of

splendid

far
up

alone
among

young
compeers
was
brian
from
his
infant
years
a
moody
and
boy
estranged
from
sympathy
and
joy
bearing
each
taunt
which
careless
tongue
on
his
mysterious
lineage
flung
whole
nights
he
spent
by
moonlight
pale
to
wood
and
stream
his
teal
to
wail
till
frantic
he
as
truth
received
what
of
his
birth
the
crowd
believed
and
sought
in
mist
and
meteor
fire
to
meet
and
know
his
phantom
sire
in
vain
to
soothe
his
wayward
fate
the
cloister
oped

pitying
gate
in
vain
the
learning
of
the
age
unclasped
the
page
even
in
its
treasures
he
could
find
food
for
the
fever
of
his
mind
eager
he
read
whatever
tells
of
magic
cabala
and
spells
and
every
dark
pursuit
allied
to
curious
and
presumptuous
pride
till
with
fired
brain
and
nerves
and
heart
with
mystic
horrors
wrung
desperate
he
sought
benharrow
den
and
hid
him
from
the
haunts
of
men
vii
the
desert
gave
him
visions
wild
such
as
might
suit
the
spectre
child
where
with
black
cliffs
the
torrents
toil
he
watched
the
wheeling
eddies
boil
jill
from
their
foam
his
dazzled
eyes
beheld

the
mountain
mist
took
form

limb
of
noontide
hag
or

grim
the

came
wild
and
dread
swelled
with
the
voices
of
the
dead
far
on
the

his
eye
beheld
the
ranks
of
death
thus
the
lone
seer
from
mankind
hurled
shaped
forth
a
disembodied
world
one
lingering
sympathy
of
mind
still
bound
him
to
the
mortal
kind
the
only
parent
he
could
claim
of
ancient
alpine
lineage
came
late
had
he
heard
in
prophet

the
fatal
boding
scream

come
in

blast
of
charging
steeds
careering
fast
along
benharrow
shingly
side
where
mortal
horseman
might
ride
the
thunderbolt
had
split
the
pine
all
augured
ill
to
alpine
line
he
girt
his
loins
and
came
to
show
the
signals
of
impending
woe
and
now
stood
prompt
to
bless
or
ban
as
bade
the
chieftain
of
his
clan

was
all
prepared
and
from
the
rock
a
goat
the
patriarch
of

pierced
by

the
sickening
victim
eyed
the
ebb
in
crimson
tide
down
his
clogged
beard
and
shaggy
limb
till
darkness
glazed
his
eyeballs
dim
the
grisly
priest
with
murmuring
prayer
a
slender
crosslet
framed
with
care
a
cubit
length
in
measure
due
the
shaft
and
limbs
were
rods
of
yew
whose
parents
in
wave
their
shadows
grave
and
answering
lomond
breezes
deep
soothe
many
a
chieftain
endless
sleep
the
cross
thus
formed
he
held
on
high
with
wasted
hand
and
haggard
eye
and
strange
and
mingled
feelings
woke
while
his
anathema
he
spoke
ix
to
the
clansman
who
shall
view
this
symbol
of
sepulchral
yew
forgetful
that
its
branches
grew
where
weep
the
heavens
their
holiest
dew
on
alpine
dwelling
low
deserter
of
his
chieftain
trust
he
shall
mingle
with
their
dust
but
from
his
sires
and
kindred
thrust
each
clansman
execration
just
shall
doom
him
wrath
and
woe
he
paused
the
word
the
vassals
took
with
forward
step
and
fiery
look
on
high
their
naked
brands
they
shook
their
clattering
targets
wildly
strook
and
first
in
murmur
low
then
like
the
billow
in
his
course
that
far
to
seaward
finds
his
source
and
flings
to
shore
his
mustered
force
burst
with
loud
roar
their
answer
hoarse
to
the
traitor
woe
gray
scalp
the
accents
knew
the
joyous
wolf
from
covert
drew
the
exulting
eagle
screamed
afar
they
knew
the
voice
of
alpine
war
x
the
shout
was
hushed
on
lake
and
fell
the
monk
resumed
his
muttered
spell
dismal
and
low
its
accents
came
the
while
he
scathed
the
cross
with
flame
and
the
few
words
that
reached
the
air
although
the
holiest
name
was
there
had
more
of
blasphemy
than
prayer
but
when
he
shook
above
the
crowd
its
kindled
points
he
spoke
aloud
to
the
wretch
who
fails
to
rear
at
this
dread
sign
the
ready
spear
for
as
the
flames
this
symbol
sear
his
home
the
refuge
of
his
fear
a
kindred
fate
shall
know
far
its
roof
the
volumed
flame
vengeance
shall
proclaim
while
maids
and
matrons
on
his
name
shall
call
down
wretchedness
and
shame
and
infamy
and
woe
then
rose
the
cry
of
females
shrill
as
goshawk
whistle
on
the
hill
denouncing
misery
and
ill
mingled
with
childhood
babbling
trill
of
curses
stammered
slow
answering
with
imprecation
dread
be
his
home
in
embers
red
and
cursed
be
the
meanest
shed
that
shall
hide
the
houseless
head
we
doom
to
want
and
woe
a
sharp
and
shrieking
echo
gave
thy
goblin
cave
and
the
gray
pass
where
birches
wave
on
xi
then
deeper
paused
the
priest
anew
and
hard
his
laboring
breath
he
drew
while
with
set
teeth
and
clenched
hand
and
eyes
that
glowed
like
fiery
brand
he
meditated
curse
more
dread
and
deadlier
on
the
clansman
head
who
summoned
to
his
chieftain
aid
the
signal
saw
and
disobeyed
the
crosslet
points
of
sparkling
wood
he
quenched
among
the
bubbling
blood
and
as
again
the
sign
he
reared
hollow
and
hoarse
his
voice
was
heard
flits
this
cross
from
man
to
man
summons
to
his
clan
burst
be
the
ear
that
fails
to
heed
palsied
the
foot
that
shuns
to

ravens
tear
the

wolves
make

heart
their

his

by

ceased
no

the
deep
amen

then
roderick
with

the

from

this
certain
that
a
band
of

has
for
two

been
ready
boune
at
prompt
command
to
march
from
doune
king
james
the
while
with
princely
powers
holds
revelry
in
stirling
towers
soon
will
this
dark
and
gathering
cloud
speak
on
our
glens
in
thunder
loud
inured
to
bide
such
bitter
bout
the
warrior
plaid
may
bear
it
out
but
norman
how
wilt
thou
provide
a
shelter
for
thy
bonny
bride
know
ye
not
that
roderick
care
to
the
lone
isle
hath
caused
repair
each
maid
and
matron
of
the
clan
and
every
child
and
aged
man
unfit
for
arms
and
given
his
charge
nor
skiff
nor
shallop
boat
nor
barge
upon
these
lakes
shall
float
at
large
but
all
beside
the
islet
moor
that
such
dear
pledge
may
rest
secure
iv
is
well
advised
the
chieftain
plan
bespeaks
the
father
of
his
clan
but
wherefore
sleeps
sir
roderick
dhu
apart
from
all
his
followers
true
is
because
last
brian
an
augury
hath
tried
of
that
dread
kind
which
must
not
be
unless
in
dread
extremity
the
taghairm
called
by
which
afar
our
sires
foresaw
the
events
of
war
duncraggan
bull
they
slew
malise
well
the
gallant
brute
i
knew
the
choicest
of
the
prey
we
had
when
swept
our
merrymen
gallangad
his
hide
was
snow
his
horns
were
dark
his
red
eye
glowed
like
fiery
spark
so
fierce
so
tameless
and
so
fleet
sore
did
he
cumber
our
retreat
and
kept
our
stoutest
kerns
in
awe
even
at
the
pass
of
beal
but
steep
and
flinty
was
the
road
and
sharp
the
hurrying
pikeman
goad
and
when
we
came
to
dennan
row
a
child
might
scathless
stroke
his
brow
norman
bull
was
slain
his
reeking
hide
they
stretched
the
cataract
beside
whose
waters
their
wild
tumult
toss
adown
the
black
and
craggy
boss
of
that
huge
cliff
whose
ample
verge
tradition
calls
the
hero
targe
couched
on
a
shelf
beneath
its
brink
close
where
the
thundering
torrents
sink
rocking
beneath
their
headlong
sway
and
drizzled
by
the
ceaseless
spray
midst
groan
of
rock
and
roar
of
stream
the
wizard
waits
prophetic
dream
nor
distant
rests
the
chief
but
hush
see
gliding
slow
through
mist
and
bush
the
hermit
gains
yon
rock
and
stands
to
gaze
upon
our
slumbering
bands
seems
he
not
malise
dike
a
ghost
that
hovers
a
slaughtered
host
or
raven
on
the
blasted
oak
that
watching
while
the
deer
is
broke
his
morsel
claims
with
sullen
croak
malise
peace
to
other
than
to
me
thy
words
were
evil
augury
but
still
i
hold
sir
roderick
blade
omen
and
her
aid
not
aught
that
gleaned
from

yon

now
together
they
descend

and
as
they
came
with

the
hermit
monk
held
solemn

it
is
a
fearful
strife
for
man
endowed
with
mortal
life
whose
shroud
of
sentient
clay
can
still
feel
feverish
pang
and
fainting
chill
whose
eye
can
stare
in
stony
trance
whose
hair
can
rouse
like

lance

hard
for
such
to

unfurled
the
curtain
of

every

my
sunken

my

who
bred
between
the
living

gifted
beyond

had
survived
to
say
he
saw
at

the
fateful
answer
came
in
characters
of
living
flame
not
spoke
in

nor
blazed
in

borne
and
branded
on
my
soul
which
spills
the

it

are
cowed
by

saw
their
boats
with
many
a
light
floating
the
livelong
yesternight
shifting
like
flashes
darted
forth
by
the
red
streamers
of
the
north
i
marked
at
morn
how
close
they
ride
thick
moored
by
the
lone
islet
side
like
wild
ducks
couching
in
the
fen
when
stoops
the
hawk
upon
the
glen
since
this
rude
race
dare
not
abide
the
peril
on

shall
not
thy
noble

care
some
safe
retreat
for
thee
prepare
ellen
allan
no

so
kind
my
wakeful
terrors
could
not
blind
when
in
such
tender
tone
yet
grave
douglas
a
parting
blessing
gave
the
tear
that
glistened
in
his
eye
drowned
not
his
purpose
fixed
and
high
my
soul
though
feminine
and
weak
can
image
his
as
the
lake
itself
disturbed
by
slightest
stroke
reflects
the
invulnerable
rock
he
hears
report
of
battle
rife
he
deems
himself
the
cause
of
strife
i
saw
him
redden
when
the
theme
turned

on
thine
idle
dream
of
malcolm

thou

then
was
gone
the

aghast

hastily
shot
past
he
joined
his

wending
down

took

a

blighted
by
wrath

in
tattered

array
stood
on

glancing
round
her

upon

the

seemed
naught
to

all
to
spy
her
brow
was
wreathed
with
gaudy
broom
with
gesture

she
waved
a
plume
of
feathers
which
the
eagles
fling
to
crag

from
dusky

such
spoils
her
desperate
step
had
sought

scarce
was

all

drew
for

the

knew

then
her
hands
she
wildly
wrung

then
she
wept

then
she
sung

sung
the

in

might
chime

thy

he
whistled
shrill
and
he
was
answered
from

wild
as
the
scream
of
the
curlew
from

that
whistle
garrisoned
the

at

with

five
hundred
men
as
if
the
yawning
hill
to
heaven
a
subterranean
host
had
given
watching
their
leader
beck
and
will
all
silent
there
they
stood
and
still
like
the
loose
crags
whose
threatening
mass
lay
tottering
the
hollow
pass
as
if
an
infant
touch
could
urge
their
headlong
passage
down

to
his

the
thrilled
with
sudden
start
he
manned
himself
with
dauntless
air
returned
the
chief
his
haughty
stare
his
back
against
a
rock
he
bore
and
firmly
placed
his
foot
before
one
come
all
this
rock
shall
fly
from
its
firm
base
as
soon
as
i
sir
roderick
marked
and
in
his
eyes
respect
was
mingled
with
surprise
and
the
stern
joy
which
warriors
feel
in
foeman
worthy
of
their
steel
short
space
he
stood
then
waved
his
hand
down
sunk
the
disappearing

each
warrior
vanished
where
he
stood
in

or
bracken
heath
or
wood
sunk

and
spear
and
bended
bow
in
osiers
pale
and
copses
low
it
seemed
as
if
their
mother
earth
had
swallowed
up
her
warlike
birth
the
wind
last
breath
had
tossed
in
air
pennon
and
plaid
and
plumage
fair
the
next
but
swept
a
lone
where
heath
and
fern
were
waving
wide
the
sun
last
glance
was
glinted
back
from
spear
and
glaive
from
targe
and
jack

next
all
unreflected
shone
on
bracken
green
and
cold
gray
stone
xi
looked
round
yet
scarce
believed
the
witness
that
his
sight
received
such
apparition
well
might
seem
delusion
of
a
dreadful
dream
sir
roderick
in
suspense
he
eyed
and
to
his
look
the
chief
replied
naught
nay
that
i
need
not
say
but
doubt
not
aught
from
mine
array
thou
art
my
guest
i
pledged
my
word
as
far
as
coilantogle
ford
nor
would
i
call
a

for

against
one
valiant
hand
though
on
our
strife
lay
every
vale
rent
by
the
saxon
from

gael
so
move
we
on
i
only
meant
to
show
the
reed
on

you
leant

you
might
pursue
without

brave
as

knight
that
belted
glaive
yet
dare
not
say
that
now
his
blood
kept
on
its
wont
and
tempered
flood
as
following
roderick
stride
he
drew
that
seeming
lonesome
pathway
through
which
yet
by
fearful
proof
was
rife
with
lances
that
to
take
his
life
waited
but
signal
from
a
guide
so
late
dishonored
and
defied
ever
by
stealth
his
eye
sought
round
the
vanished
guardians
of
the

and
stir
from

deep

peep
and
in
the
plover
shrilly
strain
the
signal
whistle
heard
again
nor
breathed
he
free
till
far
behind
the
pass
was
left
for
then
they
wind
along
a
wide
and
level
green
where
neither
tree
nor
tuft
was
seen
nor
rush
nor
bush
of

was
near
to
hide
a
bonnet

a
spear
xii
the
chief
in
silence
strode
before
and
reached
that
torrent
sounding
shore
which
daughter
of
three
mighty
lakes
from
vennachar
in
silver
breaks
sweeps
through
the
plain
and
ceaseless
mines
on
bochastle
the
mouldering
lines
where
rome
the
empress
of
the
world
of
yore
her
eagle
wings
unfurled
and
here
his

the

stayed
threw
down
his

just
has
discharged
his

the

when

xiv
dark
lightning
flashed
from
roderick
eye
thy
presumption
then
so
high
because
a
wretched
kern
ye
slew
homage
to
name
to
roderick
dhu
he
yields
not

to

nor

but
fuel
to
my
hate
my

demands
revenge
not
yet
prepared
by

i
change
my

and
hold
thy
valor
light
as
that
of
some
vain
carpet
knight
who
ill
deserved
my
courteous
care
and
whose
best
boast
is
but
to
wear
a
braid
of
his
fair
lady
hair
thank
thee
roderick
for
the
word
it
nerves
my
heart
it
steels
my

for
i
have
sworn
this
braid
to
stain
in
the
best
blood
that
warms
thy
vein
now
truce
farewell
and
rush
begone
yet
think
not
that
by
thee
alone
proud
chief
can
courtesy
be
shown
though
not
from

start
at

clansmen
stern
of

one

would
fearful
odds

thee
cast

fear
not

not

thou

try
this

then
each
at

his

drew
each
on
the

his
scabbard
threw

as

they
might
see

darkly
closed
xv
ill
fared
it
then
with
roderick
dhu
that
on
the
field
his
targe
he
threw
whose
brazen
studs
and
tough
had
death
so
often
dashed
aside
for
trained
abroad
his
arms

practised
every

to
feint
to

while
less
expert

stronger
far
the
gael
maintained
unequal
war
three
times
in
closing

they
stood
and
thrice
the
saxon
blade
drank
blood
no
stinted
draught
no
scanty
tide
the
gushing
flood
the
tartars
dyed
fierce
roderick
felt
the
fatal
drain
and
showered
his
blows
like
wintry
rain
and
as
firm
rock
or
against
the
winter
shower
is
proof
the
foe
invulnerable
still
foiled
his
wild
rage
by
steady
skill
till
at
advantage
his
brand
forced
roderick
weapon
from
his
hand
and
backward
borne
upon
the
lea
brought
the
proud
chieftain
to
his
knee
xvi
now
yield
thee

by
him
who
made

recreant
yield

fears
to

like
adder
darting
from

like
wolf
that
dashes
through
the
toil
like
who
guards
her
young
full
at

he
sprung
received
but
recked
not
of
a
wound
and
locked
his
arms
his
foeman
round
now
gallant
saxon
hold
thine
own
no
maiden
hand
is
round
thee
thrown
that
desperate
grasp
thy

through
bars

down
down
they

the

above

the
chieftain
gripe
his
throat
compressed
his
knee
was
planted
on
his
breast
his
clotted
locks
he
backward
threw
across
his
brow
his
hand
he
drew
from
blood
and
mist
to
clear
his
sight
then
gleamed
aloft
his
dagger
bright
but
hate
and
fury
ill
supplied
the
stream
of

exhausted
tide

all
too
late
the
advantage
came
to
turn
the
odds

deadly
game
for

the
dagger
gleamed
on

reeled
soul

reeled
brain
and
eye
down
came
the
blow
but
in
the
heath
the
erring
blade
found
bloodless
sheath

struggling
foe
may
now
unclasp
the
fainting
chief
relaxing
grasp
unwounded
from
the
dreadful
close

breathless
all
arose
xvii
he
faltered
thanks
to
heaven
for
life
redeemed
unhoped
from
desperate
strife
next
on
his
foe
his
look
he
cast
whose
every
gasp
appeared
his
last
in
roderick
gore
he
dipped
the
braid
blanche
thy
wrongs
are
dearly
paid
yet
with
thy
foe
must
die
or
live
the
praise
that
faith
and
valor
give
with
that
he
blew
a
bugle
note
undid
the
collar
from
his
throat
unbonneted
and
by
the
wave
sat
down
his
brow
and
hands
to
rave
then
faint
afar
are
heard
the
feet
of
rushing
steeds
in
gallop
fleet
the
sounds
increase
and
now
are
seen
four
mounted
squires
in
lincoln
green
two
who
bear
lance
and
two
who
lead
by
loosened
rein
a
saddled
steed
each
onward
held
his
headlong
course

by
reined
up
his
horse
with
wonder
viewed

bloody
spot

and

and
bind
the
wounds
of
yonder
knight
let
the
gray
palfrey
bear
his

we
destined
for
a
fairer
freight
and
bring
him
on

xviii
bayard

the
steed
obeyed
with
arching
neck
and
bended
head
and
glancing
eye
and
quivering
ear
as
if
he
loved
his
lord
to
hear
no
foot
in
stirrup
stayed
no
grasp
upon
the
saddle
laid
but
wreathed
his
left

in
the
mane
and
lightly
bounded
from

on
the

heel
and
stirred
his
courage
with
the

bounded
the
fiery
steed
in

the
rider
sat
erect
and
fair
then
like
a

from

forth
launched
along

find
in

so
lone

darkly
glooms

that
swathes
as
with

purple
shroud
benledi
distant

is
it
the
thunder
solemn
sound
that
mutters
deep
and
dread
or
echoes
from

groaning
ground
the

measured
tread
is
it
the

quivering

a
twilight
forest
frowned
their
barded
horsemen
in
the
rear
the

battalia
crowned
no
cymbal
clashed
no
clarion
rang
still
were
the
pipe
and

save
heavy
tread
and
armor
clang
the
sullen
march
was
dumb
there
breathed
no
wind
their
crests
to
shake
or
wave
their
flags
abroad
scarce
the
frail
aspen
seemed
to
quake
that
shadowed
their
road
their
vaward
scouts
no

bring
can
rouse
no
lurking
foe
nor
spy
a
trace
of

no

the

now
they
gain
a
narrow
and
a
broken
plain
before
the
trosachs
rugged
jaws
and
here
the
horse

introduction
the
lady
of
the
lake
was
first
published
in
when
scott
was
and
it
was
dedicated
to
the
most
noble
john
james
marquis
of
abercorn
eight
thousand
copies
were
sold
between
june
and
september
and
repeated
editions
were
subsequently
called
for
in
the
following
introduction
was
prefixed
to
the
poem
by
the
author
after
the
success
of
marmion
i
felt
inclined
to
exclaim
with
ulysses
in
the
odyssey
greek
letters
odys
x
one
venturous
game
my
hand
has
won
another
gallants
yet
remains
to
play
the
ancient
manners
the
habits
and
customs
of
the
aboriginal
race
by
whom
the
highlands
of
scotland
were
inhabited
had
always
appeared
to
me
peculiarly
adapted
to
poetry
the
change
in
their
manners
too
had
taken
place
almost
within
my
own
time
or
at
least
i
had
learned
many
particulars
concerning
the
ancient
state
of
the
highlands
from
the
old
men
of
the
last
generation
i
had
always
thought
the
old
scottish
gael
highly
adapted
for
poetical
composition
the
feuds
and
political
dissensions
which
half
a
century
earlier
would
have
rendered
the
richer
and
wealthier
part
of
the
kingdom
indisposed
to
countenance
a
poem
the
scene
of
which
was
laid
in
the
highlands
were
now
sunk
in
the
generous
compassion
which
the
english
more
than
any
other
nation
feel
for
the
misfortunes
of
an
honourable
foe
the
poems
of
ossian
had
by
their
popularity
sufficiently
shown
that
if
writings
on
highland
subjects
were
qualified
to
interest
the
reader
mere
national
prejudices
were
in
the
present
day
very
unlikely
to
interfere
with
their
success
i
had
also
read
a
great
deal
seen
much
and
heard
more
of
that
romantic
country
where
i
was
in
the
habit
of
spending
some
time
every
autumn
and
the
scenery
of
lock
katrine
was
connected
with
the
recollection
of
many
a
dear
friend
and
merry
expedition
of
former
days
this
poem
the
action
of
which
lay
among
scenes
so
beautiful
and
so
deeply
imprinted
on
my
recollections
was
a
labour
of
love
and
it
was
no
less
so
to
recall
the
manners
and
incidents
introduced
the
frequent
custom
of
james
and
particularly
of
james
to
walk
through
their
kingdom
in
disguise
afforded
me
the
hint
of
an
incident
which
never
fails
to
be
interesting
if
managed
with
the
slightest
address
or
dexterity
i
may
now
confess
however
that
the
employment
though
attended
with
great
pleasure
was
not
without
its
doubts
and
anxieties
a
lady
to
whom
i
was
nearly
related
and
with
whom
i
lived
during
her
whole
life
on
the
most
brotherly
terms
of
affection
was
residing
with
me
at
the
time
when
the
work
was
in
progress
and
used
to
ask
me
what
i
could
possibly
do
to
rise
so
early
in
the
morning
that
happening
to
be
the
most
convenient
to
me
for
composition
at
last
i
told
her
the
subject
of
my
meditations
and
i
can
never
forget
the
anxiety
and
affection
expressed
in
her
reply
do
not
be
so
rash
she
said
my
dearest
cousin
you
are
already
popular
more
so
perhaps
than
you
yourself
will
believe
or
than
even
i
or
other
partial
friends
can
fairly
allow
to
your
merit
you
stand
high
do
not
rashly
attempt
to
climb
higher
and
incur
the
risk
of
a
fall
for
depend
upon
it
a
favourite
will
not
be
permitted
even
to
stumble
with
impunity
i
replied
to
this
affectionate
expostulation
in
the
words
of
montrose
either
fears
his
fate
too
much
or
his
deserts
are
small
who
dares
not
put
it
to
the
touch
to
gain
or
lose
it
all
if
i
fail
i
said
for
the
dialogue
is
strong
in
my
recollection
it
is
a
sign
that
i
ought
never
to
have
succeeded
and
i
will
write
prose
for
life
you
shall
see
no
change
in
my
temper
nor
will
i
eat
a
single
meal
the
worse
but
if
i
succeed
with
the
bonnie
blue
bonnet
the
dirk
and
the
feather
and
a
afterwards
i
showed
my
affectionate
and
anxious
critic
the
first
canto
of
the
poem
which
reconciled
her
to
my
imprudence
nevertheless
although
i
answered
thus
confidently
with
the
obstinacy
often
said
to
be
proper
to
those
who
bear
my
surname
i
acknowledge
that
my
confidence
was
considerably
shaken
by
the
warning
of
her
excellent
taste
and
unbiased
friendship
nor
was
i
much
comforted
by
her
retraction
of
the
unfavourable
judgment
when
i
recollected
how
likely
a
natural
partiality
was
to
effect
that
change
of
opinion
in
such
cases
affection
rises
like
a
light
on
the
canvas
improves
any
favourable
tints
which
it
formerly
exhibited
and
throws
its
defects
into
the
shade
i
remember
that
about
the
same
time
a
friend
started
in
to
heeze
up
my
hope
like
the
sportsman
with
his
cutty
gun
in
the
old
song
he
was
bred
a
farmer
but
a
man
of
powerful
understanding
natural
good
taste
and
warm
poetical
feeling
perfectly
competent
to
supply
the
wants
of
an
imperfect
or
irregular
education
he
was
a
passionate
admirer
of
which
we
often
pursued
together
as
this
friend
happened
to
dine
with
me
at
ashestiel
one
day
i
took
the
opportunity
of
reading
to
him
the
first
canto
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
in
order
to
ascertain
the
effect
the
poem
was
likely
to
produce
upon
a
person
who
was
but
too
favourable
a
representative
of
readers
at
large
it
is
of
course
to
be
supposed
that
i
determined
rather
to
guide
my
opinion
by
what
my
friend
might
appear
to
feel
than
by
what
he
might
think
fit
to
say
his
reception
of
my
recitation
or
prelection
was
rather
singular
he
placed
his
hand
across
his
brow
and
listened
with
great
attention
through
the
whole
account
of
the
till
the
dogs
threw
themselves
into
the
lake
to
follow
their
master
who
embarks
with
ellen
douglas
he
then
started
up
with
a
sudden
exclamation
struck
his
hand
on
the
table
and
declared
in
a
voice
of
censure
calculated
for
the
occasion
that
the
dogs
must
have
been
totally
ruined
by
being
permitted
to
take
the
water
after
such
a
severe
chase
i
own
i
was
much
encouraged
by
the
species
of
revery
which
had
possessed
so
zealous
a
follower
of
the
sports
of
the
ancient
nimrod
who
had
been
completely
surprised
out
of
all
doubts
of
the
reality
of
the
tale
another
of
his
remarks
gave
me
less
pleasure
he
detected
the
identity
of
the
king
with
the
wandering
knight
when
he
winds
his
bugle
to
summon
his
attendants
he
was
probably
thinking
of
the
lively
but
somewhat
licentious
old
ballad
in
which
the
denouement
of
a
royal
intrigue
takes
place
as
follows
he
took
a
bugle
frae
his
side
he
blew
both
loud
and
shrill
and
four
and
twenty
belted
knights
came
skipping
over
the
hill
then
he
took
out
a
little
knife
let
a
his
duddies
fa
and
he
was
the
brawest
gentleman
that
was
amang
them
a
and
we
go
no
more
a
roving
etc
this
discovery
as
pepys
says
of
the
rent
in
his
camlet
cloak
was
but
a
trifle
yet
it
troubled
me
and
i
was
at
a
good
deal
of
pains
to
efface
any
marks
by
which
i
thought
my
secret
could
be
traced
before
the
conclusion
when
i
relied
on
it
with
the
same
hope
of
producing
effect
with
which
the
irish
is
said
to
reserve
a
trot
for
the
avenue
i
took
uncommon
pains
to
verify
the
accuracy
of
the
local
circumstances
of
this
story
i
recollect
in
particular
that
to
ascertain
whether
i
was
telling
a
probable
tale
i
went
into
perthshire
to
see
whether
king
james
could
actually
have
ridden
from
the
banks
of
loch
vennachar
to
stirling
castle
within
the
time
supposed
in
the
poem
and
had
the
pleasure
to
satisfy
myself
that
it
was
quite
practicable
after
a
considerable
delay
the
lady
of
the
lake
appeared
in
june
and
its
success
was
certainly
so
extraordinary
as
to
induce
me
for
the
moment
to
conclude
that
i
had
at
last
fixed
a
nail
in
the
proverbially
inconstant
wheel
of
fortune
whose
stability
in
behalf
of
an
individual
who
had
so
boldly
courted
her
favours
for
three
successive
times
had
not
as
yet
been
shaken
i
had
attained
perhaps
that
degree
of
reputation
at
which
prudence
or
certainly
timidity
would
have
made
a
halt
and
discontinued
efforts
by
which
i
was
far
more
likely
to
diminish
my
fame
than
to
increase
it
but
as
the
celebrated
john
wilkes
is
said
to
have
explained
to
his
late
majesty
that
he
himself
amid
his
full
tide
of
popularity
was
never
a
wilkite
so
i
can
with
honest
truth
exculpate
myself
from
having
been
at
any
time
a
partisan
of
my
own
poetry
even
when
it
was
in
the
highest
fashion
with
the
million
it
must
not
be
supposed
that
i
was
either
so
ungrateful
or
so
superabundantly
candid
as
to
despise
or
scorn
the
value
of
those
whose
voice
had
elevated
me
so
much
higher
than
my
own
opinion
told
me
i
deserved
i
felt
on
the
contrary
the
more
grateful
to
the
public
as
receiving
that
from
partiality
to
me
which
i
could
not
have
claimed
from
merit
and
i
endeavoured
to
deserve
the
partiality
by
continuing
such
exertions
as
i
was
capable
of
for
their
amusement
it
may
be
that
i
did
not
in
this
continued
course
of
scribbling
consult
either
the
interest
of
the
public
or
my
own
but
the
former
had
effectual
means
of
defending
themselves
and
could
by
their
coldness
sufficiently
check
any
approach
to
intrusion
and
for
myself
i
had
now
for
several
years
dedicated
my
hours
so
much
to
literary
labour
that
i
should
have
felt
difficulty
in
employing
myself
otherwise
and
so
like
dogberry
i
generously
bestowed
all
my
tediousness
on
the
public
comforting
myself
with
the
reflection
that
if
posterity
should
think
me
undeserving
of
the
favour
with
which
i
was
regarded
by
my
contemporaries
they
could
not
but
say
i
had
the
crown
and
had
enjoyed
for
a
time
that
popularity
which
is
so
much
coveted
i
conceived
however
that
i
held
the
distinguished
situation
i
had
obtained
however
unworthily
rather
like
the
champion
of
pugilism
on
the
condition
of
being
always
ready
to
show
proofs
of
my
skill
than
in
the
manner
of
the
champion
of
chivalry
who
performs
his
duties
only
on
rare
and
solemn
occasions
i
was
in
any
case
conscious
that
i
could
not
long
hold
a
situation
which
the
caprice
rather
than
the
judgment
of
the
public
had
bestowed
upon
me
and
preferred
being
deprived
of
my
precedence
by
some
more
worthy
rival
to
sinking
into
contempt
for
my
indolence
and
losing
my
reputation
by
what
scottish
lawyers
call
the
negative
prescription
accordingly
those
who
choose
to
look
at
the
introduction
to
rokeby
will
be
able
to
trace
the
steps
by
which
i
declined
as
a
poet
to
figure
as
a
novelist
as
the
ballad
says
queen
eleanor
sunk
at
charing
cross
to
rise
again
at
queenhithe
it
only
remains
for
me
to
say
that
during
my
short
of
popularity
i
faithfully
observed
the
rules
of
moderation
which
i
had
resolved
to
follow
before
i
began
my
course
as
a
man
of
letters
if
a
man
is
determined
to
make
a
noise
in
the
world
he
is
as
sure
to
encounter
abuse
and
ridicule
as
he
who
gallops
furiously
through
a
village
must
reckon
on
being
followed
by
the
curs
in
full
cry
experienced
persons
know
that
in
stretching
to
flog
the
latter
the
rider
is
very
apt
to
catch
a
bad
fall
nor
is
an
attempt
to
chastise
a
malignant
critic
attended
with
less
danger
to
the
author
on
this
principle
i
let
parody
burlesque
and
squibs
find
their
own
level
and
while
the
latter
hissed
most
fiercely
i
was
cautious
never
to
catch
them
up
as
schoolboys
do
to
throw
them
back
against
the
naughty
boy
who
fired
them
off
wisely
remembering
that
they
are
in
such
cases
apt
to
explode
in
the
handling
let
me
add
that
my
reign
since
byron
has
so
called
it
was
marked
by
some
instances
of
as
well
as
patience
i
never
refused
a
literary
person
of
merit
such
services
in
smoothing
his
way
to
the
public
as
were
in
my
power
and
i
had
the
advantage
rather
an
uncommon
one
with
our
irritable
race
to
enjoy
general
favour
without
incurring
permanent
so
far
as
is
known
to
me
among
any
of
my
contemporaries
abbotsford
april
our
limits
do
not
permit
us
to
add
any
extended
selections
from
the
many
critical
notices
of
the
poem
the
verdict
of
jeffrey
in
the
edinburgh
review
on
its
first
appearance
has
been
generally
endorsed
upon
the
whole
we
are
inclined
to
think
more
highly
of
the
lady
of
the
lake
than
of
either
of
its
author
former
publications
the
lay
and
marmion
we
are
more
sure
however
that
it
has
fewer
faults
than
that
it
has
greater
beauties
and
as
its
beauties
bear
a
strong
resemblance
to
those
with
which
the
public
has
been
already
made
familiar
in
these
celebrated
works
we
should
not
be
surprised
if
its
popularity
were
less
splendid
and
remarkable
for
our
own
parts
however
we
are
of
opinion
that
it
will
be
oftener
read
hereafter
than
either
of
them
and
that
if
it
had
appeared
first
in
the
series
their
reception
would
have
been
less
favourable
than
that
which
it
has
experienced
it
is
more
polished
in
its
diction
and
more
regular
in
its
versification
the
story
is
constructed
with
infinitely
more
skill
and
address
there
is
a
greater
proportion
of
pleasing
and
tender
passages
with
much
less
antiquarian
detail
and
upon
the
whole
a
larger
variety
of
characters
more
artfully
and
judiciously
contrasted
there
is
nothing
so
fine
perhaps
as
the
battle
in
marmion
or
so
picturesque
as
some
of
the
scattered
sketches
in
the
lay
but
there
is
a
richness
and
a
spirit
in
the
whole
piece
which
does
not
pervade
either
of
those
poems
a
profusion
of
incident
and
a
shifting
brilliancy
of
colouring
that
reminds
us
of
the
witchery
of
ariosto
and
a
constant
elasticity
and
occasional
energy
which
seem
to
belong
more
peculiarly
to
the
author
now
before
us
canto
first
each
canto
is
introduced
by
one
or
more
spenserian
stanzas
forming
a
kind
of
prelude
to
it
those
prefixed
to
the
first
canto
serve
as
an
introduction
to
the
whole
poem
which
is
inspired
by
the
spirit
of
the
old
scottish
minstrelsy
the

wych
elm
ulmus
montana
indigenous
to
scotland
forked
branches
of
the
tree
were
used

supposed
to
insure

luck

scott
has
the
following
note
here
when
the
stag
turned
to
bay
the
ancient
hunter
had
the
perilous
task
of
going
in
upon
and
killing
or
disabling
the
desperate
animal
at
certain
times
of
the
year
this
was
held
particularly
dangerous
a
wound
received
from
a
stag
horn
being
then
deemed
poisonous
and
more
dangerous
than
one
from
the
tusks
of
a
boar
as
the
old
rhyme
testifies
thou
be
hurt
with
hart
it
bring
thee
to
thy
bier
but
barber
hand
will
boar
hurt
heal
therefore
thou
not
fear
at
all
times
however
the
task
was
dangerous
and
to
be
adventured
upon
wisely
and
warily
either
by
getting
behind
the
stag
while
he
was
gazing
on
the
hounds
or
by
watching
an
opportunity
to
gallop
roundly
in
upon
him
and
kill
him
with
the
sword
see
many
directions
to
this
purpose
in
the
booke
of
hunting
chap
wilson
the
historian
has
recorded
a
providential
escape
which
befell
him
in
the
hazardous
sport
while
a
youth
and
follower
of
the
earl
of
essex
peter
lee
of
lime
in
cheshire
invited
my
lord
one
summer
to
hunt
the
stagg
and
having
a
great
stagg
in
chase
and
many
gentlemen
in
the
pursuit
the
stag
took
soyle
and
divers
whereof
i
was
one
alighted
and
stood
with
swords
drawne
to
have
a
cut
at
him
at
his
coming
out
of
the
water
the
staggs
there
being
wonderfully
fierce
and
dangerous
made
us
youths
more
eager
to
be
at
him
but
he
escaped
us
all
and
it
was
my
misfortune
to
be
hindered
of
my
coming
nere
him
the
way
being
sliperie
by
a
falle
which
gave
occasion
to
some
who
did
not
know
mee
to
speak
as
if
i
had
falne
for
feare
which
being
told
mee
i
left
the
stagg
and
followed
the
gentleman
who
first
spake
it
but
i
found
him
of
that
cold
temper
that
it
seems
his
words
made
an
escape
from
him
as
by
his
denial
and
repentance
it
appeared
but
this
made
mee
more
violent
in
the
pursuit
of
the
stagg
to
recover
my
reputation
and
i
happened
to
be
the
only
horseman
in
when
the
dogs
sett
him
up
at
bay
and
approaching
near
him
on
horsebacke
he
broke
through
the
dogs
and
run
at
mee
and
tore
my
horse
side
with
his
hornes
close
by
my
thigh
then
i
quitted
my
horse
and
grew
more
cunning
for
the
dogs
had
sette
him
up
againe
stealing
behind
him
with
my
sword
and
cut
his
hamstrings
and
then
got
upon
his
back
and
cut
his
throate
which
as
i
was
doing
the
company
came
in
and
blamed
my
rashness
for

this

was
written
amid
the
scenery

delineates
in
the
summer
of
the
quarterly
review
may
says
of
the
poet
he
sees
everything
with
a
painter
eye
whatever
he
represents
has
a
character
of
individuality
and
is
drawn
with
an
accuracy
and
minuteness
of
discrimination
which
we
are
not
accustomed
to
expect
from
mere
verbal
description
it
is
because
scott
usually
delineates
those
objects
with
which
he
is
perfectly
familiar
that
his
touch
is
so
easy
correct
and
animated
the
rocks
the
ravines
and
the
torrents
which
he
exhibits
are
not
the
imperfect
sketches
of
a
hurried
traveller
but
the
finished
studies
of
a
resident
artist

in

the

the

of

strings
they
strike

the

are

in

at
what
period
these
instruments
ceased
to
be
used
is
not
on
record
and
tradition
is
silent
on
this
head
but
as
irish
harpers
occasionally
visited
the
highlands
and
western
isles
till
lately
the
harp
might
have
been
extant
so
late
as
the
middle
of
the
present
century
thus
far
we
know
that
from
remote
times
down
to
the
present
harpers
were
received
as
welcome
guests
particularly
in
the
highlands
of
scotland
and
so
late
as
the
latter
end
of
the
sixteenth
century
as
appears
by
the
above
quotations
the
harp
was
in
common
use
among
the
natives
of
the
western
isles
how
it
happened
that
the
noisy
and
inharmonious
bagpipe
banished
the
soft
and
expressive
harp
we
can
not
say
but
certain
it
is
that
the
bagpipe
is
now
the
only
instrument
that
obtains
universally

at

where
two
of

were
set
at
a
good
distance
at
the
lower
end
of
a
long
table
with
a
parcel
of
highlanders
of
no
extraordinary
appearance
over
a
cup
of

poor
inspiration
they
were
not
asked
to
drink
a

though
the
whole

consisted
only
of
the
great
man
one
of
his
near
relations
and
myself
after
some
little
time
the
chief
ordered
one
of
them
to
sing
me
a
highland
song
the
bard
readily
obeyed
and
with
a
hoarse
voice
and
in
a
tune
of
few
various
notes
began
as
i
was
told
one
of
his
own
lyricks
and
when
he
had
proceeded
to
the
fourth
of
fifth
stanza
i
perceived
by
the
names
of
several
persons
glens
and
mountains
which
i
had
known

heard
of
before
that
it
was
an
account
of
some
clan
battle

in
his
going
on
the
chief
who
piques
himself
upon

some
particular
passage
bid
him
cease

nothing

this
you
may
believe
was
very
edifying

scott
says
the
downfall
of
the
douglases
of
the
house
of
angus
during
the
reign
of
james
is
the
event
alluded
to
in
the
text
the
earl
of
angus
it
will
be
remembered
had
married
the
queen
dowager
and
availed
himself
of
the
right
which
he
thus
acquired
as
well
as
of
his
extensive
power
to
retain
the
king
in
a
sort
of
tutelage
which
approached
very
near
to
captivity
several
open
attempts
were
made
to
rescue
james
from
this
thraldom
with
which
he
was
well
known
to
be
deeply
disgusted
but
the
valor
of
the
douglases
and
their
allies
gave
them
the
victory
in
every
conflict
at
length
the
king
while
residing
at
falkland
contrived
to
escape
by
night
out
of
his
own
court
and
palace
and
rode
full
speed
to
stirling
castle
where
the
governor
who
was
of
the
opposite
faction
joyfully
received
him
being
thus
at
liberty
james
speedily
summoned
around
him
such
peers
as
he
knew
to
be
most
inimical
to
the
domination
of
angus
and
laid
his
complaint
before
them
says
pitscottie
great
lamentations
showing
to
them
how
he
was
holding
in
subjection
thir
years
bygone
by
the
earl
of
angus
and
his
kin
and
friends
who
oppressed
the
whole
country
and
spoiled
it
under
the
pretence
of
justice
and
his
authority
and
had
slain
many
of
his
lieges
kinsmen
and
friends
because
they
would
have
had
it
mended
at
their
hands
and
put
him
at
liberty
as
he
ought
to
have
been
at
the
counsel
of
his
whole
lords
and
not
have
been
subjected
and
corrected
with
no
particular
men
by
the
rest
of
his
nobles
therefore
said
he
i
desire
my
lords
that
i
may
be
satisfied
of
the
said
earl
his
kin
and
friends
for
i
avow
that
scotland
shall
not
hold
us
both
while
till
i
be
revenged
on
him
and
his
lords
hearing
the
king
complaint
and
lamentation
and
also
the
great
rage
fury
and
malice
that
he
bure
toward
the
earl
of
angus
his
kin
and
friends
they
concluded
all
and
thought
it
best
that
he
should
be
summoned
to
underly
the
law
if
he
fand
not
caution
nor
yet
compear
himself
that
he
should
be
put
to
the
horn
with
all
his
kin
and
friends
so
many
as
were
contained
in
the

further
the
lords
ordained
by
advice
of
his

that
his

should
be
summoned
to
find
caution
to
underly
the
law
within
a
certain
day
or
else
be
put
to

but
the
earl
appeared
not

none

him

so
he
was

the

epithet

he
tined

lost

followers
in

battle
which
he
fought
he
was
vanquished
as
every

must
remember
in
the
bloody
battle
of
near
wooler
where
he
himself
lost
an
eye
and
was
made
prisoner
by
hotspur
he
was
no
less
unfortunate
when
allied
with
percy
being
wounded
and
taken
at
the
battle
of
shrewsbury
he
was
so
unsuccessful
in
an
attempt
to
beseige
roxburgh

that
it
was
called
the
raid
or

expedition
his
ill
fortune
left
him
indeed
at
the
battle
of
beauge
in
france
but
it
was
only
to
return
with
double
emphasis
at
the
subsequent
action
of
vernoil
the
last
and
most
unlucky
of
his
encounters
in
which
he
fell
with

scott
says
here
the
ancient
warriors
whose
hope
and
confidence
rested
chiefly
in
their
blades
were
accustomed
to
deduce
omens
from
them
especially
from
such
as
were
supposed
to
have
been
fabricated
by
enchanted
skill
of
which
we
have
various
instances
in
the
romances
and
legends
of
the
time
the
wonderful
sword
skofnung
wielded
by
the
celebrated
hrolf
kraka
was
of
this
description
it
was
deposited
in
the
tomb
of
the
monarch
at
his
death
and
taken
from
thence
by
skeggo
a
celebrated
pirate
who
bestowed
it
upon
his
kormak
with
the
following
curious
directions
the
manner
of
using
it
will
appear
strange
to
you
a
small
bag
is
attached
to
it
which
take
heed
not
to
violate
let
not
the
rays
of
the
sun
touch
the
upper
part
of
the
handle
nor
unsheathe
it
unless
thou
art
ready
for
battle
but
when
thou
comest
to
the
place
of
fight
go
aside
from
the
rest
grasp
and
extend
the
sword
and
breathe
upon
it
then
a
small
worm
will
creep
out
of
the
handle
lower
the
handle
that
he
may
more
easily
return
into
it
kormak
after
having
received
the
sword
returned
home
to
his
mother
he
showed
the
sword
and
attempted
to
draw
it
as
unnecessarily
as
ineffectually
for
he
could
not
pluck
it
out
of
the
sheath
his
mother
dalla
exclaimed
do
not
despise
the
counsel
given
to
thee
my
son
kormak
however
repeating
his
efforts
pressed
down
the
handle
with
his
feet
and
tore
off
the
bag
when
skofung
emitted
a
hollow
groan
but
still
he
could
not
unsheathe
the
sword
kormak
then
went
out
with
bessus
whom
he
had
challenged
to
fight
with
him
and
drew
apart
at
the
place
of
combat
he
sat
down
upon
the
ground
and
ungirding
the
sword
which
he
bore
above
his
vestments
did
not
remember
to
shield
the
hilt
from
the
rays
of
the
sun
in
vain
he
endeavored
to
draw
it
till
he
placed
his
foot
against
the
hilt
then
the
worm
issued
from
it
but
kormak
did
not
rightly
handle
the
weapon
in
consequence
whereof
good
fortune
deserted
it
as
he
unsheathed
skofnung

to
the
history
of
this
sentient
and
prescient
weapon
i
beg
leave
to
add
from
memory
the
following
legend
for
which
i
can
not
produce
any
better
authority
a
young
nobleman
of
high
hopes
and
fortune
chanced
to
lose
his
way
in
the
town
which
he
inhabited
the
capital
if
i
mistake
not
of
a
german
province
he
had
accidentally
involved
himself
among
the
narrow
and
winding
streets
of
a
suburb
inhabited
by
the
lowest
order
of
the
people
and
an
approaching
determined
him
to
ask
a
short
refuge
in
the
most
decent
habitation
that
was
near
him
he
knocked
at
the
door
which
was
opened
by
a
tall
man
of
a
grisly
and
ferocious
aspect
and
sordid
dress
the
stranger
was
readily
ushered
to
a
chamber
where
swords
scourges
and
machines
which
seemed
to
be
implements
of
torture
were
suspended
on
the
wall
one
of
these
swords
dropped
from
its
scabbard
as
the
nobleman
after
a
moment
hesitation
crossed
the
threshold
his
host
immediately
stared
at
him
with
such
a
marked
expression
that
the
young
man
could
not
help
demanding
his
name
and
business
and
the
meaning
of
his
looking
at
him
so
fixedly
am
answered
the
man
public
executioner
of
this
city
and
the
incident
you
have
observed
is
a
sure
augury
that
i
shall
in
discharge
of
my
duty
one
day
cut
off
your
head
with
the
weapon
which
has
just
now
spontaneously
unsheathed
itself
the
nobleman
lost
no
time
in
leaving
his
place
of
refuge
but
engaging
in
some
of
the
plots
of
the
period
was
shortly
after

peculiar
i
think
to
the

western

of
scotland
it
is
performed
on
a
bagpipe
and
differs
totally
from
all
other
music
its
rhythm
is
so
irregular
and
its
notes
especially
in
the
quick
movement
so
mixed
and
huddled
together
that
a
stranger
finds
it
impossible
to
reconcile
his

it

as
to

its
modulation
some

besides
his
ordinary
name
and
surname
which
were
chiefly
used
in
the
intercourse
with
the

every
highland
chief
had
an
epithet
expressive
of
his
patriarchal
dignity
as
head
of
the
clan
and
which
was
common
to
all
his
predecessors
and
successors
as
pharaoh
to
the
kings
of
egypt
or
arsaces
to
those
of
parthia
this
name
was
usually
a
patronymic
expressive
of
his
descent
from
the
founder
of
the
family
thus
the
duke
of
argyll
is
called
maccallum
more
or
the

it

stag
but
besides
this
title
which
belonged
to
his
office
and
dignity
the
chieftain
had
usually
another
peculiar
to
himself
which
distinguished
him
from
the
chieftains
of
the
same
race
this
was
sometimes
derived
from
complexion
as
dhu
or
roy
sometimes
from
size
as
beg
or
more
at
other
times
from
some
peculiar

the

of
the
highlanders
which
were
usually
composed
in

here

is
called
which
encircles
the
lower
extremity
of

was
peculiarly
exposed
to

incursions
of

mountaineers
who
inhabited
the
inaccessible
fastnesses
at
the
upper
end
of
the
lake
and
the
neighboring
district
of
loch
katrine
these
were
often
marked
by
circumstances
of
great
ferocity
of
which
the
noted
conflict
of
glen
fruin
is
a
celebrated
instance
this
was
a
in
which
the
macgregors
headed
by
allaster
macgregor
chief
of
the
clan
encountered
the
sept
of
colquhouns
commanded
by
sir
humphry
colquhoun
of
luss
it
is
on
all
hands
allowed
that
the
action
was
desperately
fought
and
that
the
colquhouns
were
defeated
with
slaughter
leaving
two
hundred
of
their
name
dead
upon
the
field
but
popular
tradition
has
added
other
horrors
to
the
tale
it
is
said
that
sir
humphry
colquhoun
who
was
on
horseback
escaped
to
the
castle
of
benechra
or
bannochar
and
was
next
day
dragged
out
and
murdered
by
the
victorious
macgregors
in
cold
blood
buchanan
of
auchmar
however
speaks
of
his
slaughter
as
a
subsequent
event
and
as
perpetrated
by
the
macfarlanes
again
it
is
reported
that
the
macgregors
murdered
a
number
of
youths
whom
report
of
the
intended
battle
had
brought
to
be
spectators
and
whom
the
colquhouns
anxious
for
their
safety
had
shut
up
in
a
barn
to
be
out
of
danger
one
account
of
the
macgregors
denies
this
circumstance
entirely
another
ascribes
it
to
the
savage
and
bloodthirsty
disposition
of
a
single
individual
the
bastard
brother
of
the
laird
of
macgregor
who
amused
himself
with
this
second
massacre
of
the
innocents
in
express
disobedience
to
the
chief
by
whom
he
was
left
their
guardian
during
the
pursuit
of
the
colquhouns
it
is
added
that
macgregor
bitterly
lamented
this
atrocious
action
and
prophesied
the
ruin
which
it
must
bring
upon
their
ancient
clan
the
consequences
of
the
battle
of
glen
fruin
were
very
calamitous
to
the
family
of
macgregor
who
had
already
been
considered
as
an
unruly
clan

widows
of
the
slain
colquhouns

the
complaints
of
this
of

that
he
let
loose
his
vengeance
against
the
macgregors
without
either
bounds
or
moderation
the
very
name
of
the
clan
was
proscribed
and
those
by
whom
it
had
been
borne
were
given
up
to
sword

hunted

had

the

the
border
robbers
who
during
the
license
of
his
minority
and
the
troubles
which
followed
had
committed
many
exorbitances
accordingly
he
assembled
a
flying
army
of
ten
thousand
men
consisting
of
his
principal
nobility
and
their
followers
who
were
directed
to
bring
their
hawks

with
them
that
the
monarch
might
refresh
himself
with

during
the
intervals

who
was
distinguished
by
the
title

the
most
noted
victim
of
justice
during
that
expedition
was
john
armstrong

confiding
in

were
hanged
at

expressed
it

was

scott
says
here
hardihood
was
in
every
respect
so
essential
to
the
character
of
a
highlander
that
the
reproach
of
effeminacy
was
the
most
bitter
which
could
be
thrown
upon
him
yet
it
was
sometimes
hazarded
on
what
we
might
presume
to
think
slight
grounds
it
is
reported
of
old
sir
ewen
cameron
of
lochiel
when
upwards
of
seventy
that
he
was
surprised
by
night
on
a
hunting
or
military
expedition
he
wrapped
him
in
his
plaid
and
lay
contentedly
down
upon
the
snow
with
which
the
ground
happened
to
be
covered
among
his
attendants
who
were
preparing
to
take
their
rest
in
the
same
manner
he
observed
that
one
of
his
grandsons
for
his
better
accommodation
had
rolled
a
large
and
placed
it
below
his
head
the
wrath
of
the
ancient
chief
was
awakened
by
a
symptom
of
what
he
conceived
to
be
degenerate
luxury
upon
thee
said
he
kicking
the
frozen
bolster
from
the
head
which
it
supported

so
effeminate
as
to
need
a
pillow
the
officer
of
engineers
whose
curious
letters
from
the
highlands
have
been
more
than
once
quoted
tells
a
similar
story
of
macdonald
of
keppoch
and
subjoins
the
following
remarks
and
many
other
stories
are
romantick
but
there
is
one
thing
that
at
first
thought
might
seem
very
romantick
of
which
i
have
been
credibly
assured
that
when
the
highlanders
are
constrained
to
lie
among
the
hills
in
cold
dry
weather
they
sometimes
soak
the
plaid
in
some
river
or
burn
brook
and
then
holding
up
a
corner
of
it
a
little
above
their
heads
they
turn
themselves
round
and
round
till
they
are
enveloped
by
the
whole
mantle
they
then
lay
themselves
down
on
the
heath
upon
the
leeward
side
of
some
hill
where
the
wet
and
the
warmth
of
their
bodies
make
a
steam
like
that
of
a
boiling
kettle
the
wet
they
say
keeps
them
warm
by
thickening
the
stuff
and
keeping
the
wind
from
penetrating
i
must
confess
i
should
have
been
apt
to
question
this
fact
had
i
not
frequently
seen
them
wet
from
morning
to
night
and
even
at
the
beginning
of
the
rain
not
so
much
as
stir
a
few
yards
to
shelter
but
continue
in
it
without
necessity
till
they
were
as
we
say
wet
through
and
through
and
that
is
soon
effected
by
the
looseness
and
spunginess
of
the
plaiding
but
the
bonnet
is
frequently
taken
off
and
wrung
like
a
dishclout
and
then
put
on
again
they
have
been
accustomed
from
their
infancy
to
be
often
wet
and
to
take
the
water
like
spaniels
and
this
is
become
a
second
nature
and
can
scarcely
be
called
a
hardship
to
them
insomuch
that
i
used
to
say
they
seemed
to
be
of
the
duck
kind
and
to
love
water
as
well
though
i
never
saw
this
preparation
for
sleep
in
windy
weather
yet
setting
out
early
in
a
morning
from
one
of
the
huts
i
have
seen
the
marks
of
their
lodging
where
the
ground
has
been
free
from

snow

remained

being

warmed

at

the
dispute
grew
very
hot
a
youth
who
was
henchman
not
understanding
one
word
of
english
imagined
his
chief
was
insulted
and
thereupon
drew
his
pistol
from
his
side
and
snapped
it
at
the
officer
head
but
the
pistol
missed
fire
otherwise
it
is
more
than
probable
he
might
have
suffered
death
from
the
hand
of
that
little
vermin
but
it
is
very
disagreeable
to
an
englishman
over
a

with
the

have
his

of
the
fiery
cross
scott
says
here
when
a
chieftain
designed
to
summon
his
clan
upon
any
sudden
or
important
emergency
he
slew
a
goat
and
making
a
cross
of
any
light
wood
seared
its
extremities
in
the
fire
and
extinguished
them
in
the
blood
of
the
animal
this
was
called
the
fiery
cross
also
crean
tarigh
or
the
cross
of
shame
because
disobedience
to
what
the
symbol
implied
inferred
infamy
it
was
delivered
to
a
swift
and
trusty
messenger
who
ran
full
speed
with
it
to
the
next
hamlet
where
he
presented
it
to
the
principal
person
with
a
single
word
implying
the
place
of
rendezvous
he
who
received
the
symbol
was
bound
to
send
it
forward
with
equal
despatch
to
the
next
village
and
thus
it
passed
with
incredible
celerity
through
all
the
district
which
owed
allegiance
to
the
chief
and
also
among
his
allies
and
neighbours
if
the
danger
was
common
to
them
at
sight
of
the
fiery
cross
every
man
from
sixteen
years
old
to
sixty
capable
of
bearing
arms
was
obliged
instantly
to
repair
in
his
best
arms
and
accoutrements
to
the
place
of
rendezvous
he
who
failed
to
appear
suffered
the
extremities
of
fire
and
sword
which
were
emblematically
denounced
to
the
disobedient
by
the
bloody
and
burnt
marks
upon
this
warlike
signal
during
the
civil
war
of
the
fiery
cross
often
made
its
circuit
and
upon
one
occasion
it
passed
through
the
whole
district
of
breadalbane
a
tract
of
miles
in
three
hours
the
late
alexander
stewart
of
invernahyle
described
to
me
his
having
sent
round
the
fiery
cross
through
the
district
of
appine
during
the
same
commotion
the
coast
was
threatened
by
a
descent
from
two
english
trigates
and
the
flower
of
the
young
men
were
with
the
army
of
prince
charles
edward
then
in
england
yet
the
summons
was
so
effectual
that
even
old
age
and
childhood
obeyed
it
and
a
force
was
collected
in
a
few
hours
so
numerous
and
so
enthusiastic
that
all
attempt
at
the
intended
diversion
upon
the
country
of
the
absent
warriors
was
in
prudence
abandoned
as
desperate
the
summer
dawn
reflected
hue
etc
ruskin
says
modern
painters
iii
and
thus
nature
becomes
dear
to
scott
in
a
threefold
way
dear
to
him
first
as
containing
those
remains
or
memories
of
the
past
which
he
can
not
find
in
cities
and
giving
hope
of
praetorian
mound
or
knight
grave
in
every
green
slope
and
shade
of
its
desolate
places
dear
secondly
in
its
moorland
liberty
which
has
for
him
just
as
high
a
charm
as
the
fenced
garden
had
for
the
mediaeval
and
dear
to
him
finally
in
that
perfect
beauty
denied
alike
in
cities
and
in
men
for
which
every
modern
heart
had
begun
at
last
to
thirst
and
scott
in
its
freshness
and
power
of
all
men
most
earnestly
and
in
this
love
of
beauty
observe
that
the
love
of
colour
is
a
leading
element
his
healthy
mind
being
incapable
of
losing
under
any
modern
false
teaching
its
joy
in
brilliancy
of
hue
in
general
if
he
does
not
mean
to
say
much
about
things
the
one
character
which
he
will
give
is
colour
using
it
with
the
most
perfect
mastery
and
faithfulness
after
giving
many
illustrations
of
scott
use
of
colour
in
his
poetry
ruskin
quotes
the
present
passage
which
he
says
is
still
more
interesting
because
it
has
no
form
in
it
at
all
except
in
one
word
chalice
but
wholly
composes
its
imagery
either
of
colour
or
of
that
delicate
life
which
we
have
seen
to
be
so
important
an
element
in
modern
landscape
two
more
considerations
he
adds
are
however
suggested
by
the
above
passage
the
first
that
the
love
of
natural
history
excited
by
the
continual
attention
now
given
to
all
wild
landscape
heightens
reciprocally
the
interest
of
that
landscape
and
becomes
an
important
element
in
scott
description
leading
him
to
finish
down
to
the
minutest
speckling
of
breast
and
slightest
shade
of
attributed
emotion
the
portraiture
of
birds
and
animals
in
strange
opposition
to
slightly
named
who
have
care
of
the
works
of
the
sea
and
dante
of
undefined
species
compare
carefully
the
and
stanzas
of
rokeby
the
second
point
i
have
to
note
is
scott
habit
of
drawing
a
slight
moral
from
every
scene
and
that
this
slight
moral
is
almost
always
melancholy
here
he
has
stopped
short
without
entirely
expressing
it
the
lie
like
future
joys
to
fancy
eye
his
completed
thought
would
be
that
these
future
joys
like
the
were
never
to
be
attained
it
occurs
fully
uttered
in
many
other
places
he
seems
to
have
been
constantly
rebuking
his
own
worldly
pride
and
vanity
but
never
purposefully
on
her
eddies
ride
thick
as
the
schemes
of
human
pride
that
down
life
current
drive
amain
as
frail
as
frothy
and
as
vain
ruskin
adds
among
other
illustrations
the
reference
to
foxglove
and
nightshade
in
i
above
like
future
joys
etc
this
passage
quoted
by
ruskin
above
also
illustrates
what
is
comparatively
rare
in
figurative
language
taking
the
immaterial
to
exemplify
the
material
the
latter
is
constantly
used
to
symbolize
or
elucidate
the
former
but
one
would
have
to
search
long
in
our
modern
poetry
to
find
a
dozen
instances
where
as
here
the
relation
is
reversed
cf
below
we
have
another
example
in
the
second
passage
quoted
by
ruskin

says
here

religion
in

ages
afforded
considerable
facilities
for
those
whose
mode
of
life
excluded
them
from

secure
nevertheless

ghostly

of

willing

of
their
doctrine

objected
this
to
them
that
there
were

for

years
were
still
unable

there

scott
has
the

note
here
the

with
which
as
scottish
lass
braided
her
hair
had
an
emblematical
signification
and
applied
to
her
maiden
character
it
was
exchanged
for
the
curch

when
she
passed
by

if
the
damsel
was
so
unfortunate
as
to
lose
pretensions
to
the
name
of
maiden
without
gaining
a
right
to
that
of
matron
she
was
neither
permitted
to
use
the
snood
nor
advanced
to
the
graver
dignity
of
the

there
occur

scott
says
here
in
adopting
the
legend
concerning
the
birth
of
the
founder
of
the
church
of
kilmallie
the
author
has
endeavored
to
trace
the
effects
which
such
a
belief
was
likely
to
produce
in
a
barbarous
age
on
the
person
to
whom
it
related
it
seems
likely
that
he
must
have
become
a
fanatic
or
an
impostor
or
that
mixture
of
both
which
forms
a
more
frequent
character
than
either
of
them
as
existing
separately
in
truth
mad
persons
are
frequently
more
anxious
to
impress
upon
others
a
faith
in
their
visions
than
they
are
themselves
confirmed
in
their
reality
as
on
the
other
hand
it
is
difficult
for
the
most
impostor
long
to
personate
an
enthusiast
without
in
some
degree
believing
what
he
is
so
eager
to
have
believed
it
was
a
natural
attribute
of
such
a
character
as
the
supposed
hermit
that
he
should
credit
the
numerous
superstitions
with
which
the
minds
of
ordinary
highlanders
are
almost
always
imbued
a
few
of
these
are
slightly
alluded
to
in
this
stanza
the
river
demon
or
for
it
is
that
form
which
he
commonly
assumes

the
kelpy
of
the

an
evil
and
malicious
spirit
delighting
to
forebode
and
to
witness
calamity
he
frequents
most
highland
lakes
and
rivers
and
one
of
his
most
memorable
exploits
was
performed
upon
the
banks
of
loch
vennachar
in
the
very
district
which
forms
the
scene
of

it
consisted
in
the

of

with
all
its

where
any
unusual
appearance
produced
by

the

scott
has
the
following
note
here
most
great
families
in
the
highlands
were
supposed
to
have
a
tutelar
or
rather
a
domestic
spirit
attached
to
them
who
took
an
interest
in
their
prosperity
and
intimated
by
its
wailings
any
approaching
disaster
that

of

an

the

and
many
other
examples
might
be
mentioned
the
implies
the
female
fairy
whose
lamentations
were
often
supposed
to
precede
the
death
of
a
chieftain
of
particular
families
when
she
is
visible
it
is
in
the
form
of
an
old
woman
with
a
blue
mantle
and
streaming
hair
a
superstition
of
the
same
kind
is
i
believe
universally
received
by
the
inferior
ranks
of
the
native
irish
the
death
of
the
head
of
a
highland
family
is
also
sometimes
supposed
to
be
announced
by
a
chain
of

of

scott
says
a
presage
of
the
kind
alluded
to
in
the
text
is
still
believed
to
announce
death
to
the
ancient
highland
family
of
of
lochbuy
the
spirit
of
an
ancestor
slain
in

is
heard
to
gallop
along
a
stony
bank
and
then
to
ride
thrice
around
the
family
residence
ringing
his
fairy
bridle
and
thus
intimating
the
approaching
calamity
how
easily
the
eye
as
well
as
the
ear
may
be
deceived
upon
such
occasions
is
evident
from
the
stories
of
armies
in
the
air
and
other
spectral
phenomena
with
which
history
abounds
such
an
apparition
is
said
to
have
been
witnessed
upon
the
side
of
southfell
mountain
between
penrith
and
keswick
upon
the

by
two
persons
william
lancaster
of

and
daniel

his
servant
whose
attestation
to
the
fact
with
a
full
account
of
the
apparition
dated
the
of
july
is
printed
in
survey
of
the
lakes
the
apparition
consisted
of
several
troops
of
horse
moving
in
regular
order
with
a
steady
rapid
motion
making
a
curved
sweep
around
the
fell
and
seeming
to
the
spectators
to
disappear
over
the
ridge
of
the
mountain
many
persons
witnessed
this
phenomenon
and
observed
the
last
or

but
one
of
the
supposed
troop
occasionally
leave
his
rank
and
pass
at
a

to
the
front
when
he
resumed
the
steady
pace

may
be

an

irrespective

an
animation
which
scott
loves

sympathizes
with
as
he
would
with
a

creature
forgetting
himself
altogether
and
subduing
his
own
humanity
before
what

him

scott
has
the
following
note
here
the
coronach
of
the
highlanders
like
the
ululatus
of
the
romans
and
the
ululoo
of
the
irish
was
a
wild
expression
of
lamentation
poured
forth
by
the
mourners
over
the
body
of
a
departed
friend
when
the
words
of
it
were
articulate
they
expressed
the
praises
of
the
deceased
and
the
loss
the
clan
would
sustain
by
his
death
the
following
is
a
lamentation
of
this
kind
literally
translated
from
the
gaelic
to
some
of
the
ideas
of
which
the
text
stands
indebted
the
tune
is
so
popular
that
it
has
since
become
the
or
gathering
of
the
clan
coronach

sir
lauchlan
chief
of
maclean
of

trace
thy

up
to

but
macvuirih
the
son
of
fergus
no
sooner
had
thine
ancient
stately
tree
taken
firm
root
in
albin
than
one
of
thy
forefathers

then
we
lost

chief
of
deathless

no

beltain

wide
around

spread
its
lofty
branches
but
the
topmost
bough

hast
forsaken

thy
oh
courteous
champion
of
montrose
oh
stately
warrior
of

celtic
isles
thou
shalt
buckle
thy
harness
on
no
more
the
coronach
has
for
some
years
past
been
suspended
at
funerals
by
the
use
of
the
bagpipe
and
that
also
is
like
many
other
highland
peculiarities
falling
into
disuse
unless
in
remote
districts
he
is
gone
etc
as
taylor
remarks
the
metre
of
this
dirge
seems
to
be
amphibrachic
that
is
made
up
of
feet
or
metrical
divisions
of
three
syllables
the
second
of
which
is
accented
some
of
the
lines
appear
to
be
anapestic
made
up
of
trisyllabic
feet
with
the
last
syllable
accented
but
the
rhythm
of
these
is
amphibrachic
that
is
the
rhythmic
pause
is
after
the
syllable
that
follows
the
accent
he
is
gone
on
the
mountain
like
a
dried
fountain
ten
lines
out
of
are
distinctly
amphibrachic
as
to
duncan
no
morrow
so
that
it
seems
best
to
treat
the
rest
as
amphibrachic
with
a
superfluous
unaccented
syllable
at
the
beginning
of
the
line
taylor
adds
the

very

scott

here
it
may
be

to
inform
the

that
the

to
that
the
sheep
may
have
the
advantage
of
the

custom

simile

scott
has
the
following
note
here
the
deep
and
implicit
respect
paid
by
the
highland
clansmen
to
their
chief
rendered
this
both
a
common
and
a
solemn
oath
in
other
respects
they
were
like
most
savage
nations
capricious
in
their
ideas
concerning
the
obligatory
power
of
oaths
one
solemn
mode
of
swearing
was
by
kissing
the
dirk
imprecating
upon
themselves
death
by
that
or
a
similar
weapon
if
they
broke
their
vow
but
for
oaths
in
the
usual
form
they
are
said
to
have
had
little
respect
as
for
the
reverence
due
to
the
chief
it
may
be
guessed
from
the
following
odd
example
of
a
highland
point
of
honour
clan
whereto
the
tribe
belongs
is
the
only
one
i
have
heard
of
which
is
without
a
chief
that
is
being
divided
into
families
under
several
chieftains
without
any
particular
patriarch
of
the
whole
name
and
this
is
a
great
reproach
as
may
appear
from
an
affair
that
fell
out
at
my
table
in
the

between
one
of
that
name
and
a

provocation
given
by
the
latter
was

it

having

notice

it

sent

prevented

has
the
following
note
here
this
is
a
very
steep
and
most
romantic
hollow
in
the
mountain
of
benvenue
overhanging
the
southeastern
extremity
of
loch
katrine
it
is
surrounded
with
stupendous
rocks
and
overshadowed
with
mingled
with
oaks
the
spontaneous
production
of
the
mountain
even
where
its
cliffs
appear
denuded
of
soil
a
dale
in
so
wild
a
situation
and
amid
a
people
whose
genius
bordered
on
the
romantic
did
not
remain
without
appropriate
deities
the
name
literally
implies
the
corri
or
den
of
the
wild
or
shaggy
men
perhaps
this
as
conjectured
by
alexander
campbell
journey
from
edinburgh
may
have
originally
only
implied
its
being
the
haunt
of
a
ferocious
banditti
but
tradition
has
ascribed
to
the
urisk
who
gives
name
to
the
cavern
a
figure
between
a
goat
and
a
man
in
short
however
much
the
classical
reader
may
be
startled
precisely
that
of
the
grecian
satyr
the
urisk
seems
not
to
have
inherited
with
the
form
the
petulance
of
the
silvan
deity
of
the
classics
his
occupation
on
the
contrary
resembled
those
of
milton
lubbar
fiend
or
of
the
scottish
brownie
though
he
differed
from
both
in
name
and
appearance
urisks
says
graham
a
sort
of
lubberly
supernaturals
who
like
the
brownies
could
be
gained
over
by
kind
attention
to
perform
the
drudgery
of
the
farm
and
it
was
believed
that
many
families
in
the
highlands
had
one
of
the
order
attached
to
it
they
were
supposed
to
be
dispersed
over
the
highlands
each
in
his
own
wild
recess
but
the
solemn
stated
meetings
of
the
order
were
regularly
held
in
this
cave
of
benvenue
this
current
superstition
no
doubt
alludes
to
some
circumstance
in
the
ancient
history
of
this
country
scenery
on
the
southern
confines
of
perthshire
it
must
be
owned
that
the
coir
or
den
does
not
in
its
present
state
meet
our
ideas
of
a
subterraneous
grotto
or
cave
being
only
a
small
and
narrow
cavity
among
huge
fragments
of
rocks
rudely
piled
together
but
such
a
scene
is
liable
to
convulsions
of
nature
which
a
lowlander
can
not
estimate
and
which
may
have
choked
up
what
was
originally
a
cavern
at
least
the
name
and
tradition
warrant
the
author
of
a
fictitious
tale
to
assert
its
having
been
such
at
the
remote
period

which
this
scene
is
laid
with

a
glimpse

scott
says
a
highland
chief
being
as
absolute
in
his
patriarchal
authority
as
any
prince
had
a
corresponding
number
of
officers
attached
to
his
person
he
had
his
called
luichttach
picked
from
his
clan
for
strength
activity
and
entire
devotion
to
his
person
these
according
to
their
deserts
were
sure
to
share
abundantly
in
the
rude
profusion
of
his
hospitality
it
is
recorded
for
example
by
tradition
that
allan
maclean
chief
of
that
clan
happened
upon
a
time
to
hear
one
of
these
favorite
retainers
observe
to
his
comrade
that
their
chief
grew
old
do
you
infer
that
replied
the
other
was
it
rejoined
the
first
a
solider
of
allan
was
obliged
as
i
am
now
not
only
to
eat
the
flesh
from
the
bone
but
even
to
tear
off
the
inner
skin
or
filament
the
hint
was
quite
sufficient
and
maclean
next
morning
to
relieve
his
followers
from
such
dire
necessity
undertook
an
inroad
on
the
mainland
the
ravage
of
which
altogether
effaced
the
memory
of
his
former
expeditions
for
the
like
purpose
our
officer
of
engineers
so
often
quoted
has
given
us
a
distinct
list
of
the
domestic
officers
who
independent
of
luichttach
or

belonged
to
the
establishment
of
a

although
this
appeared
naturally
enough
very
ridiculous
to
an
english
officer
who
considered
the
master
of
such
a
retinue
as
no
more
than
an
english
gentleman
of
a
year
yet
in
the
circumstances
of
the
chief
whose
strength
and
importance
consisted
in
the
number
and
attachment
of
his
followers
it
was
of
the
last
consequence
in
point
of
policy
to
have
in
his
gift
subordinate
offices
which
called
immediately
round
his
person
those
who
were
most
devoted
to
him
and
being
of
value
in
their
estimation
were
also
the

the

scott
says
here
the
highlanders
like
all
rude
people
had
various
superstitious
modes
of
inquiring
into
futurity
one
of
the
most
noted
was
the
taghairm
mentioned
in
the
text
a
person
was
wrapped
up
in
the
skin
of
a
bullock
and
deposited
beside
a
waterfall
or
at
the
bottom
of
a
precipice
or
in
some
other
strange
wild
and
unusual
situation
where
the
scenery
around
him
suggested
nothing
but
objects
of
horror
in
this
situation
he
revolved
in
his
mind
the
question
proposed
and
whatever
was
impressed
upon
him
by
his
exalted
imagination
passed
for
the
inspiration
of
the
disembodied
spirits
who
haunt
these
desolate
recesses
in
some
of
the
hebrides
they
attributed
the
same
oracular
power
to
a
large
black
stone
by
the
which
they
approached
with
certain
solemnities
and
considered
the
first
fancy
which
came
into
their
own
minds
after
they
did
so
to
be
the
undoubted
dictate
of
the
tutelar
deity
of
the
stone
and
as
such
to
be
if
possible
punctually
complied
with
gallangad

do
not
find
this
name
elsewhere

it
probably
belongs
to
some
part

i

this

is
taken
almost
literally
from

of
an
old
highland
kern

ketteran

they
were
called

used
to
narrate
the
merry
doings
of

he
was

this
leader
on
one
occasion
thought
proper
to
make
a
descent
upon
the
lower
part
of
the
loch
lomond
district
and
summoned
all
the
heritors
and
farmers
to
meet
at
the
kirk
of
drymen
to
pay
him
tribute
for
forbearance
and
protection
as
this
invitation
was
supported
by
a
band
of
thirty
or
forty
stout
fellows
only
one
gentleman
an
ancestor
if
i

not
of

ventured
to
decline
compliance
rob
roy
instantly
swept
his
land
of
all
he
could
drive
away
and
among
the
spoil
was
a
bull
of
the
old
scottish
wild
breed

ferocity
occasioned

note

in

long
dissertation
upon

published
in

minstrelsy
of
the
scottish
border
the
most
valuable
part
of
which
was
supplied
by
my
learned
and
indefatigable
friend
john
leyden
most
of
the
circumstances
are
collected
which
can
throw
light
upon
the
popular
belief
which
even
yet
prevails
respecting
them
in
scotland
grahame
author
of
an
entertaining
work
upon
the
scenery
of
the
perthshire
highlands
already
frequently
quoted
has
recorded
with
great
accuracy
the
peculiar
tenets
held
by
the
highlanders
on
this
topic
in
the
vicinity
of
loch
katrine
the
learned
author
is
inclined
to
deduce
the
whole
mythology
from
the
druidical
system
an
opinion
to
which
there
are
many
objections
daoine
shi
or
men
of
peace
of
the
highlanders
though
not
absolutely
malevolent
are
believed
to
be
a
peevish
repining
race
of
beings
who
possessing
themselves
but
a
scanty
portion
of
happiness
are
supposed
to
envy
mankind
their
more
complete
and
substantial
enjoyments
they
are
supposed
to
enjoy
in
their
subterraneous
recesses
a
sort
of
shadowy
happiness
a
tinsel
grandeur
which
however
they
would
willingly
exchange
for
the
more
solid
joys
of
mortality
are
believed
to
inhabit
certain
round
grassy
eminences
where
they
celebrate
their
nocturnal
festivities
by
the
light
of
the
moon
about
a
mile
beyond
the
source
of
the
forth
above
loch
con
there
is
a
placed
called
or
the
cove
of
the
men
of
peace
which
is
still
supposed
to
be
a
favorite
place
of
their
residence
in
the
neighborhood
are
to
be
seen
many
round
conical
eminences
particularly
one
near
the
head
of
the
lake
by
the
skirts
of
which
many
are
still
afraid
to
pass
after
sunset
it
is
believed
that
if
on
any
person
alone
goes
round
one
of
these
hills
nine
times
towards
the
left
hand
sinistrorsum
a
door
shall
open
by
which
he
will
be
admitted
into
their
subterraneous
abodes
many
it
is
said
of
mortal
race
have
been
entertained
in
their
secret
recesses
there
they
have
been
received
into
the
most
splendid
apartments
and
regaled
with
the
most
sumptuous
banquets
and
delicious
wines
their
females
surpass
the
daughters
of
men
in
beauty
the
seemingly
happy
inhabitants
pass
their
time
in
festivity
and
in
dancing
to
notes
of
the
softest
music
but
unhappy
is
the
mortal
who
joins
in
their
joys
or
ventures
to
partake
of
their
dainties
by
this
indulgence
he
forfeits
for
ever
the
society
of
men
and
is
bound
down
irrevocably
to
the
condition
of
or
man
of
peace
why
sounds
etc
it
has
been
already
observed
that
fairies
if
not
positively
malevolent
are
capricious
and
easily
offended
they
are
like
other
proprietors
of
forests
peculiarly
jealous
of
their
rights
of
vert
and
venison
this
jealousy
was
also
an
attribute
of
the
northern
duergar
or
dwarfs
to
many
of
whose
distinctions
the
fairies
seem
so
have
succeeded
if
indeed
they
are
not
the
same
class
of
beings
in
the
huge
metrical
record
of
german
chivalry
entitled
the
sir
hildebrand
and
the
other
heroes
of
whom
it
treats

engaged
in
one
of
their
most
desperate
adventures
from
a
rash
violation
of
the
of
an
elfin
or
dwarf
king
there
are
yet
traces
of
a
belief
in
this
worst
and
most
malicious
order
of
fairies

leyden

introduced
such
a

with

northumberland
legend
with
which
i
was
lately
favored
by
my
learned
and
kind
friend
surtees
of
mainsforth
who
has
bestowed
indefatigable
labor
upon
the
antiquities
of
the
english
border
counties
the
subject
is
in
itself
so
curious
that
the
length
of
the
note
will
i
hope
be
pardoned
have
only
one
record
to
offer
of
the
appearance
of
our
northumbrian
duergar
my
narratrix
is
elizabeth
cockburn
and
old
wife
of
offerton
in
this
country
whose
credit
in
a
case
of
this
kind
will
not
i
hope
be
much
impeached
when
i
add
that
she
is
by
her
dull
neighbors
supposed
to
be
occasionally
insane
but
by
herself
to
be
at
those
times
endowed
with
a
faculty
of
seeing
visions
and
spectral
appearances
which
shun
the
common
ken
the
year
before
the
great
rebellion
two
young
men
from
newcastle
were
sporting
on
the
high
moors
above
eldson
and
after
pursuing
their
game
several
hours
sat
down
to
dine
in
a
green
glen
near
one
of
the
mountain
streams
after
their
repast
the
younger
lad
ran
to
the
brook
for
water
and
after
stooping
to
drink
was
surprised
on
lifting
his
head
again
by
the
appearance
of
a
brown
dwarf
who
stood
on
a
crag
covered
with
brackens
across
the
burn
this
extraordinary
personage
did
not
appear
to
be
above
half
the
stature
of
a
common
man
but
was
uncommonly
stout
and
having
the
appearance
of
vast
strength
his
dress
was
entirely
brown
the
color
of
the
brackens
and
his
head
covered
with
frizzled
red
hair
his
countenance
was
expressive
of
the
most
savage
ferocity
and
his
eyes
glared
like
a
bull
it
seems
he
addressed
the
young
man
first
threatening
him
with
his
vengeance
for
having
trespassed
on
his
demesnes
and
asking
him
if
he
knew
in
whose
presence
he
stood
the
youth
replied
that
he
now
supposed
him
to
be
the
lord
of
the
moors
that
he
offended
through
ignorance
and
offered
to
bring
him
the
game
he
had
killed
the
dwarf
was
a
little
mollified
by
this
submission
but
remarked
that
nothing
could
be
more
offensive
to
him
than
such
an
offer
as
he
considered
the
wild
animals
as
his
subjects
and
never
failed
to
avenge
their
destruction
he
condescended
further
to
inform
him
that
he
was
like
himself
mortal
though
of
years
far
exceeding
the
lot
of
common
humanity
and
what
i
should
not
have
had
an
idea
of
that
he
hoped
for
salvation
he
never
he
added
fed
on
anything
that
had
life
but
lived
in
the
summer
on
whortleberries
and
in
winter
on
nuts
and
apples
of
which
he
had
great
store
in
the
woods
finally
he
invited
his
new
acquaintance
to
accompany
him
home
and
partake
his
hospitality
an
offer
which
the
youth
was
on
the
point
of
accepting
and
was
just
going
to
spring
across
the
brook
which
if
he
had
done
says
elizabeth
the
dwarf
would
certainly
have
torn
him
in
pieces
when
his
foot
was
arrested
by
the
voice
of
his
companion
who
thought
he
had
tarried
long
and
on
looking
round
again
the
wee
brown
man
was
fled
the
story
adds
that
he
was
imprudent
enough
to
slight
the
admonition
and
to
sport
over
the
moors
on
his
way
homewards
but
soon
after
his
return
he
fell
into
a
lingering
disorder
and
died
within
the
year

wore

habits
they
were
supposed
to
take
offence
when
any

ventured
to

favorite
color
indeed
from
some
reason
which
has
been
perhaps
originally
a
general
superstition

to

reason
that

splendour
it
has
been
already
noticed
in
the
former
quotations
from
grahame
entertaining
volume
and
may
be
confirmed
by
the
following
highland
tradition
woman
whose
child
had
been
conveyed
by
them
into
their
secret
abodes
was
also
carried
thither
herself
to
remain
however
only
until
she
should
suckle
her
infant
she
one
day
during
this
period
observed
the
busily
employed
in
mixing
various
ingredients
in
a
boiling
caldron
and
as
soon
as
the
composition
was
prepared
she
remarked
that
they
all
carefully
anointed
their
eyes
with
it
laying
the
remainder
aside
for
future
use
in
a
moment
when
they
were
all
absent
she
also
attempted
to
anoint
her
eyes
with
the
precious
drug
but
had
time
to
apply
it
to
one
eye
only
when
the
daoine
shi
returned
but
with
that
eye
she
was
henceforth
enabled
to
see
everything
as
it
really
passed
in
their
secret
abodes
she
saw
every
object
not
as
she
hitherto
had
done
in
deceptive
splendour
and
elegance
but
in
its
genuine
colours
and
form
the
gaudy
ornaments
of
the
apartment
were
reduced
to
the
walls
of
a
gloomy
cavern
soon
after
having
discharged
her
office
she
was
dismissed
to
her
own
home
still
however
she
retained
the
faculty
of
seeing
with
her
medicated
eye
everything
that
was
done
anywhere
in
her
presence
by
the
deceptive
art
of
the
order
one
day
amidst
a
throng
of
people
she
chanced
to
observe
the
or
man
of
peace
in
whose
possession
she
had
left
her
child
though
to
every
other
eye
invisible
prompted
by
maternal
affection
she
inadvertently
accosted
him
and
began
to
inquire
after
the
welfare
of
her
child
the
man
of
peace
astonished
at
being
thus
recognized
by
one
of
mortal
race
demanded
how
she
had
been
enabled
to
discover
him
awed
by
the
terrible
frown
of
his
countenance
she
acknowledged
what
she
had
done
he
spat
in
her
eye
and
extinguished
it
for
ever
it
is
very
remarkable
that
this
story
translated
by
grahame
from
popular
gaelic
tradition
is
to
be
found
in
the
otia
imperialia
of
gervase
of
tilbury
fn
a
work
of
great
interest
might
be
compiled
upon
the
original
of
popular
fiction
and
the
transmission
of
similar
tales
from
age
to
age
and
from
country
to
country
the
mythology
of
one
period
would
then
appear
to
pass
into
the
romance
of
the
next
century
and
that
into
the
nursery
tale
of
the
subsequent
ages
such
an
investigation
while
it
went
greatly
to
diminish
our
ideas
of
the
richness
of
human
invention
would
also
show
that
these
fictions
however
wild
and
childish
possess
such
charms
for
the
populace
as
enable
them
to
penetrate
into
countries
unconnected
by
manners
and
language
and
having
no
apparent
intercourse
to
afford
the
means
of
transmission
it
would
carry
me
far
beyond
my
bounds
to
produce
instances
of
fable
among
nations
who
never
borrowed
from
each
other
any
thing
intrinsically
worth
learning
indeed
the
wide
diffusion
of
popular
factions
may
be
compared
to
the
facility
with
which
straws
and
feathers
are
dispersed
abroad
by
the
wind
while
valuable
metals
can
not
be
transported
without
trouble

labour

only
one
gentleman

unlimited
acquaintance
with
this

enable
him
to
do
it
justice

this

seems
unjust
the
cruelty
of
roderick
raids
in

has
already
been
hinted
at
and
the
sight
of
the

dress
might
well
stir
associations
in
the
poor
girl
mind
which
would
lead
her
to
look
to
the
knight
for
help
and
protection
and
also
to
warn
him
of
his
danger
it
is
plain
from
murdoch
surprise
that
her
being
out
of
her
captors
sight
is
looked
on
as
dangerous
from
which
we
may
infer
that
she
is
not
entirely
crazed
her
song
is
not
the
only
hint
that
follows

scott
says
john
actually
used
this
illustration
when
engaged
in
confuting
the
plea
of
law
proposed
for
the
unfortunate
earl
of
strafford
was
true
we
gave
laws
to
hares
and
deer
because
they
are
beasts
of
chase
but
it
was
never
accounted
either
cruelty
or
foul
play
to
knock
foxes
or
wolves
on
the
head
as
they
can
be
found
because
they
are
beasts
of
prey
in
a
word
the
law
and
humanity
were
alike
the
one
being
more
fallacious
and
the
other
more
barbarous
than
in
any
age
had
been
vented
in
such
an
clarendon
history
of
the
rebellion
the
hardened
flesh
of
mountain
deer
the
scottish
highlanders
in
former
times
had
a
concise
mode
of
cooking
their
venison
or
rather
of
dispensing
with
cooking
it
which
appears
greatly
to
have
surprised
the
french
whom
chance
made
acquainted
with
it
the
vidame
of
chartres
when
a
hostage
in
england
during
the
reign
of
edward
was
permitted
to
travel
into
scotland
and
penetrated
as
far
as
to
the
remote
highlands
au
fin
fond
des
sauvages
after
a
great
at
which
a
most
wonderful
quantity
of
game
was
destroyed
he
saw
these
scottish
savages
devour
a
part
of
their
venison
raw
without
any
farther
preparation
than
compressing
it
between
two
batons
of
wood
so
as
to
force
out
the
blood
and
render
it
extremely
hard
this
they
reckoned
a
great
delicacy
and
when
the
vidame
partook
of
it
his
compliance
with
their
taste
rendered
him
extremely
popular
this
curious
trait
of
manners
was
communicated
by
mons
de
montmorency
a
great
friend
of
the
vidame
to
brantome
by
whom
it
is
recorded
in
vies
des
hommes
illustres
lxxxix
after
all
it
may
be
doubted
whether
la
chaire
nostree
for
so
the
french
called
the
venison
thus
summarily
prepared
was
anything
more
than
a

waiting
an
answer
to

alarming
question
he
whistled
and
the
english
officer
with
his
small

surrounded
by
a
body
of
highlanders

numbers
put

the

scott
says
the
duellists
of
former
times
did
not
always
stand
upon
those
punctilios
respecting
equality
of
arms
which
are
not
judged
essential
to
fair
combat
it
is
true
that
in
formal
combats
in
the
lists
the
parties
were
by
the
judges
of
the
field
put
as
nearly
as
possible
in
the
same
circumstances
but
in
private
duel
it
was
often
otherwise
in
that
desperate
combat
which
was
fought
between
quelus
a
minion
of
henry
iii
of
france
and
antraguet
with
two
seconds
on
each
side
from
which
only
two
persons
escaped
alive
quelus
complained
that
his
antagonist
had
over
him
the
advantage
of
a
poniard
which
he
used
in
parrying
while
his
left
hand
which
he
was
forced
to
employ
for
the
same
purpose
was
cruelly
mangled
when
he
charged
antraguet
with
this
odds
hast
done
wrong
answered
he
forget
thy
dagger
at
home
we
are
here
to
fight
and
not
to
settle
punctilios
of
arms
in
a
similar
duel
however
a
young
brother
of
the
house
of
aubayne
in
angoulesme
behaved
more
generously
on
the
like
occasion
and
at
once
threw
away
his
dagger
when
his
enemy
challenged
it
as
an
undue
advantage
but
at
this
time
hardly
anything
can
be
conceived
more
horridly
brutal
and
savage
than
the
mode
in
which
private
quarrels
were
conducted
in
france
those
who
were
most
jealous
of
the
point
of

acquired

the

was
the

him
a

partial

the

frolic
at
such

as
we
are
describing
this
sporting
in
which
kings
did
not

to
be
actors
was
prohibited
in

upon
the

by
a
statute
of

would

accordingly
they
raised
a

serious
tumult

at
length
made
prisoners
the
magistrates

endeavored
to
suppress
it
and
would
not
release
them
till
they
extorted
a
formal
promise
that
no

should
be
punished
for
his

of
the
disturbance
it
would
seem
from

complaints
of

assembly
of
the
kirk

these
profane
festivities
were
continued

person

of

behavior
during
an
unexpected
interview
with
the
laird
of
kilspindie
one
of
the
banished
douglases
under
circumstances
similar
to
those
in
the
text
is
imitated
from
a
real
story
told
by
hume
of
godscroft
i
would
have
availed
myself
more
fully
of
the
simple
and
affecting
circumstances
of
the
old
history
had
they
not
been
already
woven
into
a
pathetic
ballad
by
my
friend
finlay
the
king
implacability
towards
the
family
of
douglas
did
also
appear
in
his
carriage
towards
archibald
of
kilspinke
whom
he
when
he
was
a
child
loved
singularly
well
for
his
ability
of
body
and
was
wont
to
call
him
his
archibald
being
banished
into
england
could
not
well
comport
with
the
humor
of
that
nation
which
he
thought
to
be
too
proud
and
that
they
had
too
high
a
conceit
of
themselves
joined
with
a
contempt
and
despising
of
all
others
wherefore
being
wearied
of
that
life
and
remembering
the
king
favor
of
old
towards
him
he
determined
to
try
the
king
mercifulness
and
clemency
so
he
comes
into
scotland
and
taking
occasion
of
the
hunting
in
the
park
at
stirling
he
casts
himself
to
be
in
his
way
as
he
was
coming
home
to
the
castle
so
soon
as
the
king
saw
him
afar
off
ere
he
came
near
he
guessed
it
was
he
and
said
to
one
of
his
courtiers
yonder
is
my
archibald
of
kilspindie
if
he
be
alive
the
other
answered
that
it
could
not
be
he
and
that
he
durst
not
come
into
the
king
presence
the
king
approaching
he
fell
upon
his
knees
and
craved
pardon
and
promised
from
thenceforward
to
abstain
from
meddling
in
public
affairs
and
to
lead
a
quiet
and
private
life
the
king
went
by
without
giving
him
any
answer
and
trotted
a
good
round
pace
up
the
hill
kilspindie
followed
and
though
he
wore
on
him
a
secret
or
shirt
of
mail
for
his
particular
enemies
was
as
soon
at
the
castle
gate
as
the
king
there
he
sat
him
down
upon
a
stone
without
and
entreated
some
of
the
king
servants
for
a
cup
of
drink
being
weary
and
thirsty
but
they
fearing
the
king
displeasure
durst
gave
him
none
when
the
king
was
set
at
his
dinner
he
asked
what
he
had
done
what
he
had
said
and
whither
he
had
gone
it
was
told
him
that
he
had
desired
a
cup
of
drink
and
had
gotten
none
the
king
reproved
them
very
sharply
for
their
discourtesy
and
told
them
that
if
he
had
not
taken
an
oath
that
no
douglas
should
ever
serve
him
he
would
have
received
him
into
his
service
for
he
had
seen
him
sometime
a
man
of
great
ability
then
he
sent
him
word
to
go
to
leith
and
expect
his
further
pleasure
then
some
kinsman
of
david
falconer
the
cannonier
that
was
slain
at
tantallon
began
to
quarrel
with
archibald
about
the
matter
wherewith
the
king
showed
himself
not
well
pleased
when
he
heard
of
it
then
he
commanded
him
to
go
to
france
for
a
certain
space
till
he
heard
further
from
him
and
so
he
did
and
died
shortly
after
this
gave
occasion
to
the
king
of

overstrained

gives
us
a
vigorous
picture
of

of
men

played
a
very
important

in

time
of

these
invaders
not
venturing
to
ascend
by

ladders
along

took
a
more
circuitous
road
through
the
heart
of

most
frequented
path
at

scott

this
discovery
will

remind
the
reader
of
the
beautiful
arabian
tale
of
il
bondocani
yet
the
incident
is
not
borrowed
from
that
elegant
story
but
from
scottish
tradition
james
of
whom
we
are
treating
was
a
monarch
whose
good
and
benevolent
intentions
often
rendered
his
romantic
freaks
venial
if
not
respectable
since
from
his
anxious
attention
to
the
interests
of
the
lower
and
most
oppressed
class
of
his
subjects
he
was
as
we
have
seen
popularly
termed
the
king
of
the
commons
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
that
justice
was
regularly
administered
and
frequently
from
the
less
justifiable
motive
of
gallantry
he
used
to
traverse
the
vicinage
of
his
several
palaces
in
various
disguises
the
two
excellent
comic
songs
entitled
the
gaberlunzie
man
and
we
gae
nae
mair
a
roving
are
said
to
have
been
founded
upon
the
success
of
his
amorous
adventures
when
travelling
in
the
disguise
of
a
beggar
the
latter
is
perhaps
the
best
comic
ballad
in
any
language
another
adventure
which
had
nearly
cost
james
his
life
is
said
to
have
taken
place
at
the
village
of
cramond
near
edinburgh
where
he
had
rendered
his
addresses
acceptable
to
a
pretty
girl
of
the
lower
rank
four
or
five
persons
whether
relations
or
lovers
of
his
mistress
is
uncertain
beset
the
disguised
monarch
as
he
returned
from
his
rendezvous
naturally
gallant
and
an
admirable
master
of
his
weapon
the
king
took
post
on
the
high
and
narrow
bridge
over
the
almond
river
and
defended
himself
bravely
with
his
sword
a
peasant
who
was
thrashing
in
a
neighboring
barn
came
out
upon
the
noise
and
whether
moved
by
compassion
or
by
natural
gallantry
took
the
weaker
side
and
laid
about
with
his
flail
so
effectually
as
to
disperse
the
assailants
well
thrashed
even
according
to
the
letter
he
then
conducted
the
king
into
his
barn
where
his
guest
requested
a
basin
and
a
towel
to
remove
the
stains
of
the
broil
this
being
procured
with
difficulty
james
employed
himself
in
learning
what
was
the
summit
of
the
deliverer
earthly
wishes
and
found
that
they
were
bounded
by
the
desire
of
possessing
in
property
the
farm
of
braehead
upon
which
he
labored
as
a
bondsman
the
lands
chanced
to
belong
to
the
crown
and
james
directed
him
to
come
to
the
palace
of
holyrood
and
inquire
for
the
guidman
that
is
farmer
of
ballenguich
a
name
by
which
he
was
known
in
his
excursions
and
which
answered
to
the
il
bondocani
of
haroun
alraschid
he
presented
himself
accordingly
and
found
with
due
astonishment
that
he
had
saved
his
monarch
life
and
that
he
was
to
be
gratified
with
a
crown
charter
of
the
lands
of
braehead
under
the
service
of
presenting
a
ewer
basin
and
towel
for
the
king
to
wash
his
hands
when
he
shall
happen
to
pass
the
bridge
of
cramond
this
person
was
ancestor
of
the
howisons
of
braehead
in
a
respectable
family
who
continue
to
hold
the
lands
now
passed
into
the
female
line
under
the
same
tenure
another
of
james
frolics
is
thus
narrated
by
campbell
from
the
statistical
account
once
benighted
when
out
and
separated
from
his
attendants
he
happened
to
enter
a
cottage
in
the
midst
of
a
moor
at
the
foot
of
the
ochil
hills
near
alloa
where
unknown
he
was
kindly
received
in
order
to
regale
their
unexpected
guest
the
gudeman
desired
the
gudewife
to
fetch
the
hen
that
roosted
nearest
the
cock
which
is
always
the
plumpest
for
the
supper
the
king
highly
pleased
with
his
night
lodging
and
hospitable
entertainment
told
mine
host
at
parting
that
he
should
be
glad
to
return
his
civility
and
requested
that
the
first
time
he
came
to
stirling
he
would
call
at
the
castle
and
inquire
for
the
gudeman
of
ballenguich
donaldson
the
landlord
did
not
fail
to
call
on
the
gudeman
of
ballenguich
when
his
astonishment
at
finding
that
the
king
had
been
his
guest
afforded
no
small
amusement
to
the
merry
monarch
and
his
courtiers
and
to
carry
on
the
pleasantry
he
was
thenceforth
designated
by
james
with
the
title
of
king
of
the
moors
which
name
and
designation
have
descended
from
father
to
son
ever
since
and
they
have
continued
in
possession
of
the
identical
spot
the
property
of
erskine
of
mar
till
very
lately
when
this
gentleman
with
reluctance
turned
out
the
descendant
and
representative
of
the
king
of
the
moors
on
account
of
his
majesty
invincible
indolence
and
great
dislike
to
reform
or
innovation
of
any
kind
although
from
the
spirited
example
of
his
neighbor
tenants
on
the
same
estate
he
is
convinced
similar
exertion
would
promote
his
advantage
the
author
requests
permission
yet
farther
to
verify
the
subject
of
his
poem
by
an
extract
from
the
genealogical
work
of
buchanan
of
auchmar
upon
scottish
surnames
essay
upon
the
family
of
buchanan
john
buchanan
of
auchmar
and
arnpryor
was
afterwards
termed
king
of
kippen
a
small
district
of
perthshire
upon
the
following
account
king
james
a
very
sociable
debonair
prince
residing
at
stirling
in
buchanan
of
arnpryor
time
carriers
were
very
frequently
passing
along
the
common
road
being
near
arnpryor
house
with
necessaries
for
the
use
of
the
king
family
and
he
having
some
extraordinary
occasion
ordered
one
of
these
carriers
to
leave
his
load
at
his
house
and
he
would
pay
him
for
it
which
the
carrier
refused
to
do
telling
him
he
was
the
king
carrier
and
his
load
for
his
majesty
use
to
which
arnpryor
seemed
to
have
small
regard
compelling
the
carrier
in
the
end
to
leave
his
load
telling
him
if
king
james
was
king
of
scotland
he
was
king
of
kippen
so
that
it
was
reasonable
he
should
share
with
his
neighbor
king
in
some
of
these
loads
so
frequently
carried
that
road
the
carrier
representing
these
usage
and
telling
the
story
as
arnpryor
spoke
it
to
some
of
the
king
servants
it
came
at
length
to
his
majesty
ears
who
shortly
thereafter
with
a
few
attendants
came
to
visit
his
neighbor
king
who
was
in
the
meantime
at
dinner
king
james
having
sent
a
servant
to
demand
access
was
denied
the
same
by
a
tall
fellow
with
a
who
stood
porter
at
the
gate
telling
there
could
be
no
access
till
dinner
was
over
this
answer
not
satisfying
the
king
he
sent
to
demand
access
a
second
time
upon
which
he
was
desired
by
the
porter
to
desist
otherwise
he
would
find
cause
to
repent
his
rudeness
his
majesty
finding
this
method
would
not
do
desired
the
porter
to
tell
his
master
that
the
goodman
of
ballangeigh
desired
to
speak
with
the
king
of
kippen
the
porter
telling
arnpryor
so
much
he
in
all
humble
manner
came
and
received
the
king
and
having
entertained
him
with
much
sumptuousness
and
jollity
became
so
agreeable
to
king
james
that
he
allowed
him
to
take
so
much
of
any
provision
he
found
carrying
that
road
as
he
had
occasion
for
and
seeing
he
made
the
first
visit
desired
arnpryor
in
a
few
days
to
return
him
a
second
to
stirling
which
he
performed
and
continued
in
very
much
favor
with
the
king
always
thereafter
being
termed
king
of
kippen
while
he
lived
the
readers
of
ariosto
must
give
credit
for
the
amiable
features
with
which
james
is
represented
since
he
is
generally
considered
as
the
prototype
of
zerbino
the
most
interesting
hero
of

and
adds

not
have

of

probably

to

fantastically
adopted

from

that

was
the

derived
from

of

a
minute
collation
of
the
text
with
that
of
the
ed
and
our
own
shows
that
scott
carefully
revised
the
poem
for
this
and
that
the
changes
he
afterwards
made
in
it
were
few
and
unimportant
for
instance
the
text
includes
the
verbal
changes
which
we
have
adopted
in

in

fol
it
reads
including
the
omissions

insertions
as

in

the
pointing
is
the
same
as
in
the
ed
and
in
i
the
reading
is
dear
in
ii
it
varies
from
the
pointing
of
the
ed
but
we
are
inclined
to
regard
this
as
a
misprint
not
a
correction
in
ii
this
ed
has
lingerewave
for
lingerer
wave
and
in
ii
it
repeats
the
preposterous
misprint
of
his
glee
from
the
ed
if
scott
could
overlook
such
palpable
errors
as
these
he
might
easily
fail
to
detect
the
misplacing
of
a
comma
we
have
our
doubts
as
to
i
where
the
and
eds
agree
but
there
a
misprint
may
have
been
left
uncorrected
