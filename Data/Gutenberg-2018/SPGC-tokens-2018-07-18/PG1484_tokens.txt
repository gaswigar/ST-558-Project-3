in

they
were
to
have
met
in
the
garden
of
the
chapelle
expiatoire
at
five
o
clock
in
the
afternoon
but
julio
desnoyers
with
the
impatience
of
a
lover
who
hopes
to
advance
the
moment
of
meeting
by
presenting
himself
before
the
appointed
time
arrived
an
half
hour
earlier
the
change
of
the
seasons
was
at
this
time
greatly
confused
in
his
mind
and
evidently
demanded
some
readjustment
five
months
had
passed
since
their
last
interview
in
this
square
had
afforded
the
wandering
lovers
the
refuge
of
a
damp
depressing
calmness
near
a
boulevard
of
continual
movement
close
to
a
great
railroad
station
the
hour
of
the
appointment
was
always
five
and
julio
was
accustomed
to
see
his
beloved
approaching
by
the
reflection
of
the
recently
lit
street
lamps
her
figure
enveloped
in
furs
and
holding
her
muff
before
her
face
as
if
it
were
a
her
sweet
voice
greeting
him
had
breathed
forth
a
cloud
of
vapor
white
and
tenuous
congealed
by
the
cold
after
various
hesitating
interviews
they
had
abandoned
the
garden
their
love
had
acquired
the
majestic
importance
of
acknowledged
fact
and
from
five
to
seven
had
taken
refuge
in
the
fifth
floor
of
the
rue
de
la
pompe
where
julio
had
an
artist
s
studio
the
curtains
well
drawn
over
the
double
glass
windows
the
cosy
sending
forth
its
ruddy
flame
as
the
only
light
of
the
room
the
monotonous
song
of
the
samovar
bubbling
near
the
cups
of
tea
all
the
seclusion
of
life
isolated
by
an
idolizing
love
had
dulled
their
perceptions
to
the
fact
that
the
afternoons
were
growing
longer
that
outside
the
sun
was
shining
later
and
later
into
the
depths
of
the
clouds
and
that
a
timid
and
pallid
spring
was
beginning
to
show
its
green
finger
tips
in
the
buds
of
the
branches
suffering
the
last
nips
of
winter
that
wild
black
boar
who
so
often
turned
on
his
tracks
then
julio
had
made
his
trip
to
buenos
aires
encountering
in
the
other
hemisphere
the
last
smile
of
autumn
and
the
first
icy
winds
from
the
pampas
and
just
as
his
mind
was
becoming
reconciled
to
the
fact
that
for
him
winter
was
an
eternal
season
since
it
always
came
to
meet
him
in
his
change
of
domicile
from
one
extreme
of
the
planet
to
the
other
lo
summer
was
unexpectedly
confronting
him
in
this
dreary
garden
a
swarm
of
children
was
racing
and
screaming
through
the
short
avenues
around
the
monument
on
entering
the
place
the
first
thing
that
julio
encountered
was
a
hoop
which
came
rolling
toward
his
legs
trundled
by
a
childish
hand
then
he
stumbled
over
a
ball
around
the
chestnut
trees
was
gathering
the
usual
crowd
seeking
the
blue
shade
perforated
with
points
of
light
many
from
the
neighboring
houses
were
working
and
chattering
here
following
with
indifferent
glances
the
rough
games
of
the
children
confided
to
their
care
near
them
were
the
men
who
had
brought
their
papers
down
into
the
garden
under
the
impression
that
they
could
read
them
in
the
midst
of
peaceful
groves
all
of
the
benches
were
full
a
few
women
were
occupying
camp
stools
with
that
feeling
of
superiority
which
ownership
always
confers
the
iron
chairs
were
serving
as
resting
places
for
various
suburban
dames
loaded
down
with
packages
who
were
waiting
for
straggling
members
of
their
families
in
order
to
take
the
train
in
the
gare
saint
lazare
and
julio
in
his
special
delivery
letter
had
proposed
meeting
in
this
place
supposing
that
it
would
be
as
little
frequented
as
in
former
times
she
too
with
the
same
thoughtlessness
had
in
her
reply
set
the
usual
hour
of
five
o
clock
believing
that
after
passing
a
few
minutes
in
the
printemps
or
the
galeries
on
the
pretext
of
shopping
she
would
be
able
to
slip
over
to
the
unfrequented
garden
without
risk
of
being
seen
by
any
of
her
numerous
acquaintances
desnoyers
was
enjoying
an
almost
forgotten
sensation
that
of
strolling
through
vast
spaces
crushing
as
he
walked
the
grains
of
sand
under
his
feet
for
the
past
twenty
days
his
rovings
had
been
upon
planks
following
with
the
automatic
precision
of
a
riding
school
the
oval
promenade
on
the
deck
of
a
ship
his
feet
accustomed
to
insecure
ground
still
were
keeping
on
terra
firma
a
certain
sensation
of
elastic
unsteadiness
his
goings
and
comings
were
not
awakening
the
curiosity
of
the
people
seated
in
the
open
for
a
common
preoccupation
seemed
to
be
monopolizing
all
the
men
and
women
the
groups
were
exchanging
impressions
those
who
happened
to
have
a
paper
in
their
hands
saw
their
neighbors
approaching
them
with
a
smile
of
interrogation
there
had
suddenly
disappeared
that
distrust
and
suspicion
which
impels
the
inhabitants
of
large
cities
mutually
to
ignore
one
another
taking
each
other
s
measure
at
a
glance
as
though
they
were
enemies
they
are
talking
about
the
war
said
desnoyers
to
himself
at
this
time
all
paris
speaks
of
nothing
but
the
possibility
of
outside
of
the
garden
he
could
see
also
the
same
anxiety
which
was
making
those
around
him
so
fraternal
and
sociable
the
venders
of
newspapers
were
passing
through
the
boulevard
crying
the
evening
editions
their
furious
speed
repeatedly
slackened
by
the
eager
hands
of
the
contending
for
the
papers
every
reader
was
instantly
surrounded
by
a
group
begging
for
news
or
trying
to
decipher
over
his
shoulder
the
great
headlines
at
the
top
of
the
sheet
in
the
rue
des
mathurins
on
the
other
side
of
the
square
a
circle
of
workmen
under
the
awning
of
a
tavern
were
listening
to
the
comments
of
a
friend
who
accompanied
his
words
with
oratorical
gestures
and
wavings
of
the
paper
the
traffic
in
the
streets
the
general
bustle
of
the
city
was
the
same
as
in
other
days
but
it
seemed
to
julio
that
the
vehicles
were
whirling
past
more
rapidly
that
there
was
a
feverish
agitation
in
the
air
and
that
people
were
speaking
and
smiling
in
a
different
way
the
women
of
the
garden
were
looking
even
at
him
as
if
they
had
seen
him
in
former
days
he
was
able
to
approach
them
and
begin
a
conversation
without
experiencing
the
slightest
strangeness
they
are
talking
of
the
war
he
said
again
but
with
the
commiseration
of
a
superior
intelligence
which
foresees
the
future
and
feels
above
the
impressions
of
the
vulgar
crowd
he
knew
exactly
what
course
he
was
going
to
follow
he
had
disembarked
at
ten
o
clock
the
night
before
and
as
it
was
not
yet
hours
since
he
had
touched
land
his
mentality
was
still
that
of
a
man
who
comes
from
afar
across
oceanic
immensities
from
boundless
horizons
and
is
surprised
at
finding
himself
in
touch
with
the
preoccupations
which
govern
human
communities
after
disembarking
he
had
spent
two
hours
in
a
cafe
in
boulogne
listlessly
watching
the
families
who
passed
their
time
in
the
monotonous
placidity
of
a
life
without
dangers
then
the
special
train
for
the
passengers
from
south
america
had
brought
him
to
paris
leaving
him
at
four
in
the
morning
on
a
platform
of
the
gare
du
nord
in
the
embrace
of
pepe
argensola
the
young
spaniard
whom
he
sometimes
called
my
secretary
or
my
valet
because
it
was
difficult
to
define
exactly
the
relationship
between
them
in
reality
he
was
a
mixture
of
friend
and
parasite
the
poor
comrade
complacent
and
capable
in
his
companionship
with
a
rich
youth
on
bad
terms
with
his
family
sharing
with
him
the
ups
and
downs
of
fortune
picking
up
the
crumbs
of
prosperous
days
or
inventing
expedients
to
keep
up
appearances
in
the
hours
of
poverty
what
about
the
war
argensola
had
asked
him
before
inquiring
about
the
result
of
his
trip
you
have
come
a
long
ways
and
should
know
soon
he
was
sound
asleep
in
his
dear
old
bed
while
his
secretary
was
pacing
up
and
down
the
studio
talking
of
servia
russia
and
the
kaiser
this
youth
too
skeptical
as
he
generally
was
about
everything
not
connected
with
his
own
interests
appeared
infected
by
the
general
excitement
when
desnoyers
awoke
he
found
her
note
awaiting
him
setting
their
meeting
at
five
that
afternoon
and
also
containing
a
few
words
about
the
threatened
danger
which
was
claiming
the
attention
of
all
paris
upon
going
out
in
search
of
lunch
the
concierge
on
the
pretext
of
welcoming
him
back
had
asked
him
the
war
news
and
in
the
restaurant
the
cafe
and
the
street
always
war
the
possibility
of
war
with
germany
julio
was
an
optimist
what
did
all
this
restlessness
signify
to
a
man
who
had
just
been
living
more
than
twenty
days
among
germans
crossing
the
atlantic
under
the
flag
of
the
empire
he
had
sailed
from
buenos
aires
in
a
steamer
of
the
hamburg
line
the
koenig
frederic
august
the
world
was
in
blessed
tranquillity
when
the
boat
left
port
only
the
whites
and
of
mexico
were
exterminating
each
other
in
conflicts
in
order
that
nobody
might
believe
that
man
is
an
animal
degenerated
by
peace
on
the
rest
of
the
planet
the
people
were
displaying
unusual
prudence
even
aboard
the
transatlantic
liner
the
little
world
of
passengers
of
most
diverse
nationalities
appeared
a
fragment
of
future
society
implanted
by
way
of
experiment
in
modern
times
a
sketch
of
the
hereafter
without
frontiers
or
race
antagonisms
one
morning
the
ship
band
which
every
sunday
had
sounded
the
choral
of
luther
awoke
those
sleeping
in
the
cabins
with
the
most
serenade
desnoyers
rubbed
his
eyes
believing
himself
under
the
hallucinations
of
a
dream
the
german
horns
were
playing
the
marseillaise
through
the
corridors
and
decks
the
steward
smiling
at
his
astonishment
said
the
fourteenth
of
july
on
the
german
steamers
they
celebrate
as
their
own
the
great
festivals
of
all
the
nations
represented
by
their
cargo
and
passengers
their
captains
are
careful
to
observe
scrupulously
the
rites
of
this
religion
of
the
flag
and
its
historic
commemoration
the
most
insignificant
republic
saw
the
ship
decked
in
its
honor
affording
one
more
diversion
to
help
combat
the
monotony
of
the
voyage
and
further
the
lofty
ends
of
the
germanic
propaganda
for
the
first
time
the
great
festival
of
france
was
being
celebrated
on
a
german
vessel
and
whilst
the
musicians
continued
escorting
a
racy
marseillaise
in
double
quick
time
through
the
different
floors
the
morning
groups
were
commenting
on
the
event
what
finesse
exclaimed
the
south
american
ladies
these
germans
are
not
so
phlegmatic
as
they
seem
it
is
an
attention
something
very
distinguished
and
is
it
possible
that
some
still
believe
that
they
and
the
french
might
come
to
blows
the
very
few
frenchmen
who
were
travelling
on
the
steamer
found
themselves
admired
as
though
they
had
increased
immeasurably
in
public
esteem
there
were
only
three
an
old
jeweller
who
had
been
visiting
his
branch
shops
in
america
and
two
from
the
rue
de
la
paix
the
most
timid
and
persons
aboard
vestals
with
bright
eyes
and
disdainful
noses
who
held
themselves
stiffly
aloof
in
this
uncongenial
atmosphere
at
night
there
was
a
gala
banquet
in
the
dining
room
at
the
end
of
which
the
french
flag
and
that
of
the
empire
formed
a
flaunting
conspicuous
drapery
all
the
german
passengers
were
in
dress
suits
and
their
wives
were
wearing
gowns
the
uniforms
of
the
attendants
were
as
resplendent
as
on
a
day
of
a
grand
review
during
dessert
the
tapping
of
a
knife
upon
a
glass
reduced
the
table
to
sudden
silence
the
commandant
was
going
to
speak
and
this
brave
mariner
who
united
to
his
nautical
functions
the
obligation
of
making
harangues
at
banquets
and
opening
the
dance
with
the
lady
of
most
importance
began
unrolling
a
string
of
words
like
the
noise
of
clappers
between
long
intervals
of
silence
desnoyers
knew
a
little
german
as
a
souvenir
of
a
visit
to
some
relatives
in
berlin
and
so
was
able
to
catch
a
few
words
the
commandant
was
repeating
every
few
minutes
peace
and
a
table
neighbor
a
commercial
commissioner
offered
his
services
as
interpreter
to
julio
with
that
obsequiousness
which
lives
on
advertisement
the
commandant
asks
god
to
maintain
peace
between
germany
and
france
and
hopes
that
the
two
peoples
will
become
increasingly
another
orator
arose
at
the
same
table
he
was
the
most
influential
of
the
german
passengers
a
rich
manufacturer
from
dusseldorf
who
had
just
been
visiting
his
agents
in
america
he
was
never
mentioned
by
name
he
bore
the
title
of
commercial
counsellor
and
among
his
countrymen
was
always
herr
comerzienrath
and
his
wife
was
entitled
frau
rath
the
counsellor
s
lady
much
younger
than
her
important
husband
had
from
the
first
attracted
the
attention
of
desnoyers
she
too
had
made
an
exception
in
favor
of
this
young
argentinian
abdicating
her
title
from
their
first
conversation
call
me
bertha
she
said
as
condescendingly
as
a
duchess
of
versailles
might
have
spoken
to
a
handsome
abbot
seated
at
her
feet
her
husband
also
protested
upon
hearing
desnoyers
call
him
counsellor
like
his
compatriots
my
friends
he
said
call
me
i
command
a
company
of
the
and
the
air
with
which
the
manufacturer
accompanied
these
words
revealed
the
melancholy
of
an
unappreciated
man
scorning
the
honors
he
has
in
order
to
think
only
of
those
he
does
not
possess
while
he
was
delivering
his
discourse
julio
was
examining
his
small
head
and
thick
neck
which
gave
him
a
certain
resemblance
to
a
bull
dog
in
imagination
he
saw
the
high
and
oppressive
collar
of
a
uniform
making
a
double
roll
of
fat
above
its
stiff
edge
the
waxed
upright
moustaches
were
bristling
aggressively
his
voice
was
sharp
and
dry
as
though
he
were
shaking
out
his
words
thus
the
emperor
would
utter
his
harangues
so
the
martial
burgher
with
instinctive
imitation
was
contracting
his
left
arm
supporting
his
hand
upon
the
hilt
of
an
invisible
sword
in
spite
of
his
fierce
and
oratorical
gesture
of
command
all
the
listening
germans
laughed
uproariously
at
his
first
words
like
men
who
knew
how
to
appreciate
the
sacrifice
of
a
herr
comerzienrath
when
he
deigns
to
divert
a
festivity
he
is
saying
very
witty
things
about
the
french
volunteered
the
interpreter
in
a
low
voice
but
they
are
not
julio
had
guessed
as
much
upon
hearing
repeatedly
the
word
franzosen
he
almost
understood
what
the
orator
was
saying
franzosen
great
children
amusing
improvident
the
things
that
they
might
do
together
if
they
would
only
forget
past
grudges
the
attentive
germans
were
no
longer
laughing
the
counsellor
was
laying
aside
his
irony
that
grandiloquent
crushing
irony
weighing
many
tons
as
enormous
as
a
ship
then
he
began
unrolling
the
serious
part
of
his
harangue
so
that
he
himself
was
also
greatly
affected
he
says
sir
reported
julio
s
neighbor
that
he
wishes
france
to
become
a
very
great
nation
so
that
some
day
we
may
march
together
against
other
enemies
against
others
and
he
winked
one
eye
smiling
maliciously
with
that
smile
of
common
intelligence
which
this
allusion
to
the
mysterious
enemy
always
awakened
finally
the
raised
his
glass
in
a
toast
to
france
hoch
he
yelled
as
though
he
were
commanding
an
evolution
of
his
soldierly
reserves
three
times
he
sounded
the
cry
and
all
the
german
contingent
springing
to
their
feet
responded
with
a
lusty
hoch
while
the
band
in
the
corridor
blared
forth
the
marseillaise
desnoyers
was
greatly
moved
thrills
of
enthusiasm
were
coursing
up
and
down
his
spine
his
eyes
became
so
moist
that
when
drinking
his
champagne
he
almost
believed
that
he
had
swallowed
some
tears
he
bore
a
french
name
he
had
french
blood
in
his
veins
and
this
that
the
gringoes
were
doing
although
generally
they
seemed
to
him
ridiculous
and
ordinary
was
really
worth
acknowledging
the
subjects
of
the
kaiser
celebrating
the
great
date
of
the
revolution
he
believed
that
he
was
witnessing
a
great
historic
event
very
well
done
he
said
to
the
other
south
americans
at
the
near
tables
we
must
admit
that
they
have
done
the
handsome
then
with
the
vehemence
of
his
years
he
accosted
the
jeweller
in
the
passage
way
reproaching
him
for
his
silence
he
was
the
only
french
citizen
aboard
he
should
have
made
a
few
words
of
acknowledgment
the
fiesta
was
ending
awkwardly
through
his
fault
and
why
have
you
not
spoken
as
a
son
of
france
retorted
the
jeweller
i
am
an
argentinian
citizen
replied
julio
and
he
left
the
older
man
believing
that
he
ought
to
have
spoken
and
making
explanations
to
those
around
him
it
was
a
very
dangerous
thing
he
protested
to
meddle
in
diplomatic
affairs
furthermore
he
had
not
instructions
from
his
government
and
for
a
few
hours
he
believed
that
he
had
been
on
the
point
of
playing
a
great
role
in
history
desnoyers
passed
the
rest
of
the
evening
in
the
smoking
room
attracted
thither
by
the
presence
of
the
counsellor
s
lady
the
captain
of
the
landsturm
sticking
a
preposterous
cigar
between
his
moustachios
was
playing
poker
with
his
countrymen
ranking
next
to
him
in
dignity
and
riches
his
wife
stayed
beside
him
most
of
the
time
watching
the
goings
and
comings
of
the
stewards
carrying
great
bocks
without
daring
to
share
in
this
tremendous
consumption
of
beer
her
special
preoccupation
was
to
keep
vacant
near
her
a
seat
which
desnoyers
might
occupy
she
considered
him
the
most
distinguished
man
on
board
because
he
was
accustomed
to
taking
champagne
with
all
his
meals
he
was
of
medium
height
a
decided
brunette
with
a
small
foot
which
obliged
her
to
tuck
hers
under
her
skirts
and
a
triangular
face
under
two
masses
of
hair
straight
black
and
glossy
as
lacquer
the
very
opposite
of
the
type
of
men
about
her
besides
he
was
living
in
paris
in
the
city
which
she
had
never
seen
after
numerous
trips
in
both
hemispheres
oh
paris
paris
she
sighed
opening
her
eyes
and
pursing
her
lips
in
order
to
express
her
admiration
when
she
was
speaking
alone
to
the
argentinian
how
i
should
love
to
go
there
and
in
order
that
he
might
feel
free
to
tell
her
things
about
paris
she
permitted
herself
certain
confidences
about
the
pleasures
of
berlin
but
with
a
blushing
modesty
admitting
in
advance
that
in
the
world
there
was
more
much
more
that
she
wished
to
become
acquainted
with
while
pacing
around
the
chapelle
expiatoire
julio
recalled
with
a
certain
remorse
the
wife
of
counsellor
erckmann
he
who
had
made
the
trip
to
america
for
a
woman
s
sake
in
order
to
collect
money
and
marry
her
then
he
immediately
began
making
excuses
for
his
conduct
nobody
was
going
to
know
furthermore
he
did
not
pretend
to
be
an
ascetic
and
bertha
erckmann
was
certainly
a
tempting
adventure
in
mid
ocean
upon
recalling
her
his
imagination
always
saw
a
race
horse
large
spare
roan
colored
and
with
a
long
stride
she
was
an
german
who
admitted
no
defect
in
her
country
except
the
excessive
weight
of
its
women
combating
in
her
person
this
national
menace
with
every
known
system
of
dieting
for
her
every
meal
was
a
species
of
torment
and
the
procession
of
bocks
in
the
smoking
room
a
tantalizing
agony
the
slenderness
achieved
and
maintained
by
will
power
only
made
more
prominent
the
size
of
her
frame
the
powerful
skeleton
with
heavy
jaws
and
large
teeth
strong
and
dazzling
which
perhaps
suggested
desnoyers
disrespectful
comparison
she
is
thin
but
enormous
nevertheless
was
always
his
conclusion
but
then
he
considered
her
notwithstanding
the
most
distinguished
woman
on
board
distinguished
for
the
sea
elegant
in
the
style
of
munich
with
clothes
of
indescribable
colors
that
suggested
persian
art
and
the
vignettes
of
mediaeval
manuscripts
the
husband
admired
bertha
s
elegance
lamenting
her
childlessness
in
secret
almost
as
though
it
were
a
crime
of
high
treason
germany
was
magnificent
because
of
the
fertility
of
its
women
the
kaiser
with
his
artistic
hyperbole
had
proclaimed
that
the
true
german
beauty
should
have
a
waist
measure
of
at
least
a
yard
and
a
half
when
desnoyers
entered
into
the
smoking
room
in
order
to
take
the
seat
which
bertha
had
reserved
for
him
her
husband
and
his
wealthy
had
their
pack
of
cards
lying
idle
upon
the
green
felt
herr
rath
was
continuing
his
discourse
and
his
listeners
taking
their
cigars
from
their
mouths
were
emitting
grunts
of
approbation
the
arrival
of
julio
provoked
a
general
smile
of
amiability
here
was
france
coming
to
fraternize
with
them
they
knew
that
his
father
was
french
and
that
fact
made
him
as
welcome
as
though
he
came
in
direct
line
from
the
palace
of
the
quai
d
orsay
representing
the
highest
diplomacy
of
the
republic
the
craze
for
proselyting
made
them
all
promptly
concede
to
him
unlimited
importance
we
continued
the
counsellor
looking
fixedly
at
desnoyers
as
if
he
were
expecting
a
solemn
declaration
from
him
we
wish
to
live
on
good
terms
with
the
youth
nodded
his
head
so
as
not
to
appear
inattentive
it
appeared
to
him
a
very
good
thing
that
these
peoples
should
not
be
enemies
and
as
far
as
he
was
concerned
they
might
affirm
this
relationship
as
often
as
they
wished
the
only
thing
that
was
interesting
him
just
at
that
time
was
a
certain
knee
that
was
seeking
his
under
the
table
transmitting
its
gentle
warmth
through
a
double
curtain
of
silk
but
france
complained
the
manufacturer
is
most
unresponsive
towards
us
for
many
years
past
our
emperor
has
been
holding
out
his
hand
with
noble
loyalty
but
she
pretends
not
to
see
it
that
you
must
admit
is
not
as
it
should
just
here
desnoyers
believed
that
he
ought
to
say
something
in
order
that
the
spokesman
might
not
divine
his
more
engrossing
occupation
perhaps
you
are
not
doing
enough
if
first
of
all
you
would
return
that
which
you
took
away
from
france
stupefied
silence
followed
this
remark
as
if
the
alarm
signal
had
sounded
through
the
boat
some
of
those
who
were
about
putting
their
cigars
in
their
mouths
remained
with
hands
immovable
within
two
inches
of
their
lips
their
eyes
almost
popping
out
of
their
heads
but
the
captain
of
the
landsturm
was
there
to
formulate
their
mute
protest
return
he
said
in
a
voice
almost
extinguished
by
the
sudden
swelling
of
his
neck
we
have
nothing
to
return
for
we
have
taken
nothing
that
which
we
possess
we
acquire
by
our
the
hidden
knee
with
its
agreeable
friction
made
itself
more
insinuating
as
though
counselling
the
youth
to
greater
prudence
do
not
say
such
things
breathed
bertha
thus
only
the
republicans
corrupted
by
paris
talk
a
youth
so
distinguished
who
has
been
in
berlin
and
has
relatives
in
germany
but
desnoyers
felt
a
hereditary
impulse
of
aggressiveness
before
each
of
her
husband
s
statements
enunciated
in
haughty
tones
and
responded
coldly
it
is
as
if
i
should
take
your
watch
and
then
propose
that
we
should
be
friends
forgetting
the
occurrence
although
you
might
forget
the
first
thing
for
me
to
do
would
be
to
return
the
counsellor
erckmann
wished
to
retort
with
so
many
things
at
once
that
he
stuttered
horribly
leaping
from
one
idea
to
the
other
to
compare
the
reconquest
of
alsace
to
a
robbery
a
german
country
the
race
the
language
the
history
but
when
did
they
announce
their
wish
to
be
german
asked
the
youth
without
losing
his
calmness
when
have
you
consulted
their
opinion
the
counsellor
hesitated
not
knowing
whether
to
argue
with
this
insolent
fellow
or
crush
him
with
his
scorn
young
man
you
do
not
know
what
you
are
talking
about
he
finally
blustered
with
withering
contempt
you
are
an
argentinian
and
do
not
understand
the
affairs
of
and
the
others
agreed
suddenly
repudiating
the
citizenship
which
they
had
attributed
to
him
a
little
while
before
the
counsellor
with
military
rudeness
brusquely
turned
his
back
upon
him
and
taking
up
the
pack
distributed
the
cards
the
game
was
renewed
desnoyers
seeing
himself
isolated
by
the
scornful
silence
felt
greatly
tempted
to
break
up
the
playing
by
violence
but
the
hidden
knee
continued
counselling
and
an
invisible
hand
had
sought
his
right
pressing
it
sweetly
that
was
enough
to
make
him
recover
his
serenity
the
counsellor
s
lady
seemed
to
be
absorbed
in
the
progress
of
the
game
he
also
looked
on
a
malignant
smile
contracting
slightly
the
lines
of
his
mouth
as
he
was
mentally
ejaculating
by
way
of
consolation
captain
captain
you
little
know
what
is
awaiting
you
on
terra
firma
he
would
never
again
have
approached
these
men
but
life
on
a
transatlantic
liner
with
its
inevitable
promiscuousness
obliges
forgetfulness
the
following
day
the
counsellor
and
his
friends
came
in
search
of
him
flattering
his
sensibilities
by
erasing
every
irritating
memory
he
was
a
distinguished
youth
belonging
to
a
wealthy
family
and
all
of
them
had
shops
and
business
in
his
country
the
only
thing
was
that
he
should
be
careful
not
to
mention
his
french
origin
he
was
an
argentinian
and
thereupon
the
entire
chorus
interested
itself
in
the
grandeur
of
his
country
and
all
the
nations
of
south
america
where
they
had
agencies
or
investments
exaggerating
its
importance
as
though
its
petty
republics
were
great
powers
commenting
with
gravity
upon
the
deeds
and
words
of
its
political
leaders
and
giving
him
to
understand
that
in
germany
there
was
no
one
who
was
not
concerned
about
the
future
of
south
america
predicting
for
all
its
divisions
most
glorious
prosperity
a
reflex
of
the
empire
always
provided
of
course
that
they
kept
under
germanic
influence
in
spite
of
these
flatteries
desnoyers
was
no
longer
presenting
himself
with
his
former
assiduity
at
the
hour
of
poker
the
counsellor
s
wife
was
retiring
to
her
stateroom
earlier
than
usual
their
approach
to
the
equator
inducing
such
an
irresistible
desire
for
sleep
that
she
had
to
abandon
her
husband
to
his
card
playing
julio
also
had
mysterious
occupations
which
prevented
his
appearance
on
deck
until
after
midnight
with
the
precipitation
of
a
man
who
desires
to
be
seen
in
order
to
avoid
suspicion
he
was
accustomed
to
enter
the
smoking
room
talking
loudly
as
he
seated
himself
near
the
husband
and
his
boon
companions
the
game
had
ended
and
an
orgy
of
beer
and
fat
cigars
from
hamburg
was
celebrating
the
success
of
the
winners
it
was
the
hour
of
teutonic
expansion
of
intimacy
among
men
of
heavy
sluggish
jokes
of
stories
the
counsellor
was
presiding
with
much
majesty
over
the
diableries
of
his
chums
prudent
business
men
from
the
hanseatic
ports
who
had
big
accounts
in
the
deutsche
bank
or
were
shopkeepers
installed
in
the
republic
of
the
la
plata
with
an
innumerable
family
he
was
a
warrior
a
captain
and
on
applauding
every
heavy
jest
with
a
laugh
that
distended
his
fat
neck
he
fancied
that
he
was
among
his
comrades
at
arms
in
honor
of
the
south
americans
who
tired
of
pacing
the
deck
had
dropped
in
to
hear
what
the
gringoes
were
saying
they
were
turning
into
spanish
the
witticisms
and
licentious
anecdotes
awakened
in
the
memory
by
a
superabundance
of
beer
julio
was
marvelling
at
the
ready
laugh
of
all
these
men
while
the
foreigners
were
remaining
unmoved
they
would
break
forth
into
loud
throwing
themselves
back
in
their
seats
and
when
the
german
audience
was
growing
cold
the
would
resort
to
an
infallible
expedient
to
remedy
his
lack
of
success
they
told
this
yarn
to
the
kaiser
and
when
the
kaiser
heard
it
he
laughed
it
was
not
necessary
to
say
more
they
all
laughed
then
ha
ha
ha
with
a
spontaneous
roar
but
a
short
one
a
laugh
in
three
blows
since
to
prolong
it
might
be
interpreted
as
a
lack
of
respect
to
his
majesty
as
they
neared
europe
a
batch
of
news
came
to
meet
the
boat
the
employees
in
the
wireless
telegraphy
office
were
working
incessantly
one
night
on
entering
the
smoking
room
desnoyers
saw
the
german
notables
gesticulating
with
animated
countenances
they
were
no
longer
drinking
beer
they
had
had
bottles
of
champagne
uncorked
and
the
counsellor
s
lady
much
impressed
had
not
retired
to
her
stateroom
captain
erckmann
spying
the
young
argentinian
offered
him
a
glass
it
is
war
he
shouted
with
enthusiasm
war
at
last
the
hour
has
come
desnoyers
made
a
gesture
of
astonishment
war
what
war
like
all
the
others
he
had
read
on
the
news
bulletin
outside
a
radiogram
stating
that
the
austrian
government
had
just
sent
an
ultimatum
to
servia
but
it
made
not
the
slightest
impression
on
him
for
he
was
not
at
all
interested
in
the
balkan
affairs
those
were
but
the
quarrels
of
a
miserable
little
nation
monopolizing
the
attention
of
the
world
distracting
it
from
more
worthwhile
matters
how
could
this
event
concern
the
martial
counsellor
the
two
nations
would
soon
come
to
an
understanding
diplomacy
sometimes
amounted
to
something
no
insisted
the
german
ferociously
it
is
war
blessed
war
russia
will
sustain
servia
and
we
will
support
our
ally
what
will
france
do
do
you
know
what
france
will
do
julio
shrugged
his
shoulders
testily
as
though
asking
to
be
left
out
of
all
international
discussions
it
is
war
asserted
the
counsellor
the
preventive
war
that
we
need
russia
is
growing
too
fast
and
is
preparing
to
fight
us
four
years
more
of
peace
and
she
will
have
finished
her
strategic
railroads
and
her
military
power
united
to
that
of
her
allies
will
be
worth
as
much
as
ours
it
is
better
to
strike
a
powerful
blow
now
it
is
necessary
to
take
advantage
of
this
opportunity
war
preventive
war
all
his
clan
were
listening
in
silence
some
did
not
appear
to
feel
the
contagion
of
his
enthusiasm
war
in
imagination
they
saw
their
business
paralyzed
their
agencies
bankrupt
the
banks
cutting
down
credit
a
catastrophe
more
frightful
to
them
than
the
slaughters
of
battles
but
they
applauded
with
nods
and
grunts
all
of
erckmann
s
ferocious
demonstrations
he
was
a
herr
rath
and
an
officer
besides
he
must
be
in
the
secrets
of
the
destiny
of
his
country
and
that
was
enough
to
make
them
drink
silently
to
the
success
of
the
war
julio
thought
that
the
counsellor
and
his
admirers
must
be
drunk
look
here
captain
he
said
in
a
conciliatory
tone
what
you
say
lacks
logic
how
could
war
possibly
be
acceptable
to
industrial
germany
every
moment
its
business
is
increasing
every
month
it
conquers
a
new
market
and
every
year
its
commercial
balance
soars
upward
in
unheard
of
proportions
sixty
years
ago
it
had
to
man
its
boats
with
berlin
hack
drivers
arrested
by
the
police
now
its
commercial
fleets
and
war
vessels
cross
all
oceans
and
there
is
no
port
where
the
german
merchant
marine
does
not
occupy
the
greatest
part
of
the
docks
it
would
only
be
necessary
to
continue
living
in
this
way
to
put
yourselves
beyond
the
exigencies
of
war
twenty
years
more
of
peace
and
the
germans
would
be
lords
of
the
world
s
commerce
conquering
england
the
former
mistress
of
the
seas
in
a
bloodless
struggle
and
are
they
going
to
risk
all
this
like
a
gambler
who
stakes
his
entire
fortune
on
a
single
card
in
a
struggle
that
might
result
unfavorably
no
war
insisted
the
counsellor
furiously
preventive
war
we
live
surrounded
by
our
enemies
and
this
state
of
things
can
not
go
on
it
is
best
to
end
it
at
once
either
they
or
we
germany
feels
herself
strong
enough
to
challenge
the
world
we
ve
got
to
put
an
end
to
this
russian
menace
and
if
france
doesn
t
keep
herself
quiet
so
much
the
worse
for
her
and
if
anyone
else
anyone
dares
to
come
in
against
us
so
much
the
worse
for
him
when
i
set
up
a
new
machine
in
my
shops
it
is
to
make
it
produce
unceasingly
we
possess
the
finest
army
in
the
world
and
it
is
necessary
to
give
it
exercise
that
it
may
not
rust
he
then
continued
with
heavy
emphasis
they
have
put
a
band
of
iron
around
us
in
order
to
throttle
us
but
germany
has
a
strong
chest
and
has
only
to
expand
in
order
to
burst
its
bands
we
must
awake
before
they
manacle
us
in
our
sleep
woe
to
those
who
then
oppose
us
desnoyers
felt
obliged
to
reply
to
this
arrogance
he
had
never
seen
the
iron
circle
of
which
the
germans
were
complaining
the
nations
were
merely
unwilling
to
continue
living
unsuspecting
and
inactive
before
boundless
german
ambition
they
were
simply
preparing
to
defend
themselves
against
an
almost
certain
attack
they
wished
to
maintain
their
dignity
repeatedly
violated
under
most
absurd
pretexts
i
wonder
if
it
is
not
the
others
he
concluded
who
are
obliged
to
defend
themselves
because
you
represent
a
menace
to
the
world
an
invisible
hand
sought
his
under
the
table
as
it
had
some
nights
before
to
recommend
prudence
but
now
he
clasped
it
forcibly
with
the
authority
of
a
right
acquired
oh
sir
sighed
the
sweet
bertha
to
talk
like
that
a
youth
so
distinguished
who
has
she
was
not
able
to
finish
for
her
husband
interrupted
they
were
no
longer
in
american
waters
and
the
counsellor
expressed
himself
with
the
rudeness
of
a
master
of
his
house
i
have
the
honor
to
inform
you
young
man
he
said
imitating
the
cutting
coldness
of
the
diplomats
that
you
are
merely
a
south
american
and
know
nothing
of
the
affairs
of
he
did
not
call
him
an
indian
but
julio
heard
the
implication
as
though
he
had
used
the
word
itself
ah
if
that
hidden
handclasp
had
not
held
him
with
its
sentimental
thrills
but
this
contact
kept
him
calm
and
even
made
him
smile
thanks
captain
he
said
to
himself
it
is
the
least
you
can
do
to
get
even
with
me
here
his
relations
with
the
german
and
his
clientele
came
to
an
end
the
merchants
as
they
approached
nearer
and
nearer
to
their
native
land
began
casting
off
that
servile
desire
of
ingratiating
themselves
which
they
had
assumed
in
all
their
trips
to
the
new
world
they
now
had
more
important
things
to
occupy
them
the
telegraphic
service
was
working
without
cessation
the
commandant
of
the
vessel
was
conferring
in
his
apartment
with
the
counsellor
as
his
compatriot
of
most
importance
his
friends
were
hunting
out
the
most
obscure
places
in
order
to
talk
confidentially
with
one
another
even
bertha
commenced
to
avoid
desnoyers
she
was
still
smiling
distantly
at
him
but
that
smile
was
more
of
a
souvenir
than
a
reality
between
lisbon
and
the
coast
of
england
julio
spoke
with
her
husband
for
the
last
time
every
morning
was
appearing
on
the
bulletin
board
the
alarming
news
transmitted
by
radiograph
the
empire
was
arming
itself
against
its
enemies
god
would
punish
them
making
all
manner
of
troubles
fall
upon
them
desnoyers
was
motionless
with
astonishment
before
the
last
piece
of
news
three
hundred
thousand
revolutionists
are
now
besieging
paris
the
suburbs
are
beginning
to
burn
the
horrors
of
the
commune
have
broken
out
my
but
these
germans
have
gone
mad
exclaimed
the
disgusted
youth
to
the
curious
group
surrounding
the
we
are
going
to
lose
the
little
sense
that
we
have
left
what
revolutionists
are
they
talking
about
how
could
a
revolution
break
out
in
paris
if
the
men
of
the
government
are
not
reactionary
a
gruff
voice
sounded
behind
him
rude
authoritative
as
if
trying
to
banish
the
doubts
of
the
audience
it
was
the
herr
comerzienrath
who
was
speaking
young
man
these
notices
are
sent
us
by
the
first
agencies
of
germany
and
germany
never
after
this
affirmation
he
turned
his
back
upon
them
and
they
saw
him
no
more
on
the
following
morning
the
last
day
of
the
voyage
desnoyers
steward
awoke
him
in
great
excitement
herr
come
up
on
deck
a
most
beautiful
spectacle
the
sea
was
veiled
by
the
fog
but
behind
its
hazy
curtains
could
be
distinguished
some
silhouettes
like
islands
with
great
towers
and
sharp
pointed
minarets
the
islands
were
advancing
over
the
oily
waters
slowly
and
majestically
with
impressive
dignity
julio
counted
eighteen
they
appeared
to
fill
the
ocean
it
was
the
channel
fleet
which
had
just
left
the
english
coast
by
government
order
sailing
around
simply
to
show
its
strength
seeing
this
procession
of
dreadnoughts
for
the
first
time
desnoyers
was
reminded
of
a
flock
of
marine
monsters
and
gained
a
better
idea
of
the
british
power
the
german
ship
passed
among
them
shrinking
humiliated
quickening
its
speed
one
might
suppose
mused
the
youth
that
she
had
an
uneasy
conscience
and
wished
to
scud
to
a
south
american
passenger
near
him
was
jesting
with
one
of
the
germans
what
if
they
have
already
declared
war
what
if
they
should
make
us
prisoners
after
midday
they
entered
southampton
roads
the
frederic
august
hurried
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
and
transacted
business
with
dizzying
celerity
the
cargo
of
passengers
and
baggage
was
enormous
two
launches
approached
the
transatlantic
and
discharged
an
avalanche
of
germans
residents
in
england
who
invaded
the
decks
with
the
joy
of
those
who
tread
friendly
soil
desiring
to
see
hamburg
as
soon
as
possible
then
the
boat
sailed
through
the
channel
with
a
speed
most
unusual
in
these
places
the
people
leaning
on
the
railing
were
commenting
on
the
extraordinary
encounters
in
this
marine
boulevard
usually
frequented
by
ships
of
peace
certain
smoke
lines
on
the
horizon
were
from
the
french
squadron
carrying
president
poincare
who
was
returning
from
russia
the
european
alarm
had
interrupted
his
trip
then
they
saw
more
english
vessels
patrolling
the
coast
line
like
aggressive
and
vigilant
dogs
two
north
american
battleships
could
be
distinguished
by
their
in
the
form
of
baskets
then
a
russian
battleship
white
and
glistening
passed
at
full
steam
on
its
way
to
the
baltic
bad
said
the
south
american
passengers
regretfully
very
bad
it
looks
this
time
as
if
it
were
going
to
be
serious
and
they
glanced
uneasily
at
the
neighboring
coasts
on
both
sides
although
they
presented
the
usual
appearance
behind
them
perhaps
a
new
period
of
history
was
in
the
making
the
transatlantic
was
due
at
boulogne
at
midnight
where
it
was
supposed
to
wait
until
daybreak
to
discharge
its
passengers
comfortably
it
arrived
nevertheless
at
ten
dropped
anchor
outside
the
harbor
and
the
commandant
gave
orders
that
the
disembarkation
should
take
place
in
less
than
an
hour
for
this
reason
they
had
quickened
their
speed
consuming
a
vast
amount
of
extra
coal
it
was
necessary
to
get
away
as
soon
as
possible
seeking
the
refuge
of
hamburg
the
radiographic
apparatus
had
evidently
been
working
to
some
purpose
by
the
glare
of
the
bluish
searchlights
which
were
spreading
a
livid
clearness
over
the
sea
began
the
unloading
of
passengers
and
baggage
for
paris
from
the
transatlantic
into
the
tenders
hurry
hurry
the
seamen
were
pushing
forward
the
ladies
of
slow
step
who
were
recounting
their
valises
believing
that
they
had
lost
some
the
stewards
loaded
themselves
up
with
babies
as
though
they
were
bundles
the
general
precipitation
dissipated
the
usual
exaggerated
and
oily
teutonic
amiability
they
are
regular
bootlickers
thought
desnoyers
they
believe
that
their
hour
of
triumph
has
come
and
do
not
think
it
necessary
to
pretend
any
he
was
soon
in
a
launch
that
was
bobbing
up
and
down
on
the
waves
near
the
black
and
immovable
hulk
of
the
great
liner
dotted
with
many
circles
of
light
and
filled
with
people
waving
handkerchiefs
julio
recognized
bertha
who
was
waving
her
hand
without
seeing
him
without
knowing
in
which
tender
he
was
but
feeling
obliged
to
show
her
gratefulness
for
the
sweet
memories
that
now
were
being
lost
in
the
mystery
of
the
sea
and
the
night
adieu
frau
rath
the
distance
between
the
departing
transatlantic
and
the
lighters
was
widening
as
though
it
had
been
awaiting
this
moment
with
impunity
a
stentorian
voice
on
the
upper
deck
shouted
with
a
noisy
guffaw
see
you
later
soon
we
shall
meet
you
in
paris
and
the
marine
band
the
very
same
band
that
three
days
before
had
astonished
desnoyers
with
its
unexpected
marseillaise
burst
forth
into
a
military
march
of
the
time
of
frederick
the
great
a
march
of
grenadiers
with
an
accompaniment
of
trumpets
that
had
been
the
night
before
although
hours
had
not
yet
passed
by
desnoyers
was
already
considering
it
as
a
distant
event
of
shadowy
reality
his
thoughts
always
disposed
to
take
the
opposite
side
did
not
share
in
the
general
alarm
the
insolence
of
the
counsellor
now
appeared
to
him
but
the
boastings
of
a
burgher
turned
into
a
soldier
the
disquietude
of
the
people
of
paris
was
but
the
nervous
agitation
of
a
city
which
lived
placidly
and
became
alarmed
at
the
first
hint
of
danger
to
its
comfort
so
many
times
they
had
spoken
of
an
immediate
war
always
settling
things
peacefully
at
the
last
moment
furthermore
he
did
not
want
war
to
come
because
it
would
upset
all
his
plans
for
the
future
and
the
man
accepted
as
logical
and
reasonable
everything
that
suited
his
selfishness
placing
it
above
reality
no
there
will
not
be
war
he
repeated
as
he
continued
pacing
up
and
down
the
garden
these
people
are
beside
themselves
how
could
a
war
possibly
break
out
in
these
days
and
after
disposing
of
his
doubts
which
certainly
would
in
a
short
time
come
up
again
he
thought
of
the
joy
of
the
moment
consulting
his
watch
five
o
clock
she
might
come
now
at
any
minute
he
thought
that
he
recognized
her
afar
off
in
a
lady
who
was
passing
through
the
grating
by
the
rue
pasquier
she
seemed
to
him
a
little
different
but
it
occurred
to
him
that
possibly
the
summer
fashions
might
have
altered
her
appearance
but
soon
he
saw
that
he
had
made
a
mistake
she
was
not
alone
another
lady
was
with
her
they
were
perhaps
english
or
north
american
women
who
worshipped
the
memory
of
marie
antoinette
and
wished
to
visit
the
chapelle
expiatoire
the
old
tomb
of
the
executed
queen
julio
watched
them
as
they
climbed
the
flights
of
steps
and
crossed
the
interior
patio
in
which
were
interred
the
eight
hundred
swiss
soldiers
killed
in
the
attack
of
the
tenth
of
august
with
other
victims
of
revolutionary
fury
disgusted
at
his
error
he
continued
his
tramp
his
ill
humor
made
the
monument
with
which
the
bourbon
restoration
had
adorned
the
old
cemetery
of
the
madeleine
appear
uglier
than
ever
to
him
time
was
passing
but
she
did
not
come
every
time
that
he
turned
he
looked
hungrily
at
the
entrances
of
the
garden
and
then
it
happened
as
in
all
their
meetings
she
suddenly
appeared
as
if
she
had
fallen
from
the
sky
or
risen
up
from
the
ground
like
an
apparition
a
cough
a
slight
rustling
of
footsteps
and
as
he
turned
julio
almost
collided
with
her
marguerite
oh
marguerite
it
was
she
and
yet
he
was
slow
to
recognize
her
he
felt
a
certain
strangeness
in
seeing
in
full
reality
the
countenance
which
had
occupied
his
imagination
for
three
months
each
time
more
spirituelle
and
shadowy
with
the
idealism
of
absence
but
his
doubts
were
of
short
duration
then
it
seemed
as
though
time
and
space
were
eliminated
that
he
had
not
made
any
voyage
and
but
a
few
hours
had
intervened
since
their
last
interview
marguerite
divined
the
expansion
which
might
follow
julio
s
exclamations
the
vehement
perhaps
something
more
so
she
kept
herself
calm
and
serene
no
not
here
she
said
with
a
grimace
of
repugnance
what
a
ridiculous
idea
for
us
to
have
met
here
they
were
about
to
seat
themselves
on
the
iron
chairs
in
the
shadow
of
some
shrubbery
when
she
rose
suddenly
those
who
were
passing
along
the
boulevard
might
see
them
by
merely
casting
their
eyes
toward
the
garden
at
this
time
many
of
her
friends
might
be
passing
through
the
neighborhood
because
of
its
proximity
to
the
big
shops
they
therefore
sought
refuge
at
a
corner
of
the
monument
placing
themselves
between
it
and
the
rue
des
mathurins
desnoyers
brought
two
chairs
near
the
hedge
so
that
when
seated
they
were
invisible
to
those
passing
on
the
other
side
of
the
railing
but
this
was
not
solitude
a
few
steps
away
a
fat
nearsighted
man
was
reading
his
paper
and
a
group
of
women
were
chatting
and
embroidering
a
woman
with
a
red
wig
and
two
dogs
some
housekeeper
who
had
come
down
into
the
garden
in
order
to
give
her
pets
an
airing
passed
several
times
near
the
amorous
pair
smiling
discreetly
how
annoying
groaned
marguerite
why
did
we
ever
come
to
this
place
the
two
scrutinized
each
other
carefully
wishing
to
see
exactly
what
transformation
time
had
wrought
you
are
darker
than
ever
she
said
you
look
like
a
man
of
the
julio
was
finding
her
even
lovelier
than
before
and
felt
sure
that
possessing
her
was
well
worth
all
the
contrarieties
which
had
brought
about
his
trip
to
south
america
she
was
taller
than
he
with
an
elegantly
proportioned
slenderness
she
has
the
musical
step
desnoyers
had
told
himself
when
seeing
her
in
his
imagination
and
now
on
beholding
her
again
the
first
thing
that
he
admired
was
her
rhythmic
tread
light
and
graceful
as
she
passed
through
the
garden
seeking
another
seat
her
features
were
not
regular
but
they
had
a
piquant
fascination
a
true
parisian
face
everything
that
had
been
invented
for
the
embellishment
of
feminine
charm
was
used
about
her
person
with
the
most
exquisite
fastidiousness
she
had
always
lived
for
herself
only
a
few
months
before
had
she
abdicated
a
part
of
this
sweet
selfishness
sacrificing
reunions
teas
and
calls
in
order
to
give
desnoyers
some
of
the
afternoon
hours
stylish
and
painted
like
a
priceless
doll
with
no
loftier
ambition
than
to
be
a
model
interpreting
with
personal
elegance
the
latest
confections
of
the
modistes
she
was
at
last
experiencing
the
same
preoccupations
and
joys
as
other
women
creating
for
herself
an
inner
life
the
nucleus
of
this
new
life
hidden
under
her
former
frivolity
was
desnoyers
just
as
she
was
imagining
that
she
had
reorganized
her
existence
adjusting
the
satisfactions
of
worldly
elegance
to
the
delights
of
love
in
intimate
secrecy
a
fulminating
catastrophe
the
intervention
of
her
husband
whose
possible
appearance
she
seemed
to
have
overlooked
had
disturbed
her
thoughtless
happiness
she
who
was
accustomed
to
think
herself
the
centre
of
the
universe
imagining
that
events
ought
to
revolve
around
her
desires
and
tastes
had
suffered
this
cruel
surprise
with
more
astonishment
than
grief
and
you
how
do
you
think
i
look
marguerite
queried
i
must
tell
you
that
the
fashion
has
changed
the
sheath
skirt
has
passed
away
now
it
is
worn
short
and
with
more
desnoyers
had
to
interest
himself
in
her
apparel
with
the
same
devotion
mixing
his
appreciation
of
the
latest
freak
of
the
with
his
eulogies
of
marguerite
s
beauty
have
you
thought
much
about
me
she
continued
you
have
not
been
unfaithful
to
me
a
single
time
not
even
once
tell
me
the
truth
you
know
i
can
always
tell
when
you
are
i
have
always
thought
of
you
he
said
putting
his
hand
on
his
heart
as
if
he
were
swearing
before
a
judge
and
he
said
it
roundly
with
an
accent
of
truth
since
in
his
infidelities
now
completely
forgotten
the
memory
of
marguerite
had
always
been
present
but
let
us
talk
about
you
added
julio
what
have
you
been
doing
all
the
time
he
had
brought
his
chair
nearer
to
hers
and
their
knees
touched
he
took
one
of
her
hands
patting
it
and
putting
his
finger
in
the
glove
opening
oh
that
accursed
garden
which
would
not
permit
greater
intimacy
and
obliged
them
to
speak
in
a
low
tone
after
three
months
absence
in
spite
of
his
discretion
the
man
who
was
reading
his
paper
raised
his
head
and
looked
irritably
at
them
over
his
spectacles
as
though
a
fly
were
distracting
him
with
its
buzzing
the
very
idea
of
talking
in
a
public
garden
when
all
europe
was
threatened
with
calamity
repelling
the
audacious
hand
marguerite
spoke
tranquilly
of
her
existence
during
the
last
months
i
have
passed
my
life
the
best
i
could
but
i
have
been
greatly
bored
you
know
that
i
am
now
living
with
mama
and
mama
is
a
lady
of
the
old
regime
who
does
not
understand
our
tastes
i
have
been
to
the
theatres
with
my
brother
i
have
made
many
calls
on
the
lawyer
in
order
to
learn
the
progress
of
my
divorce
and
hurry
it
along
and
nothing
and
your
husband
don
t
let
s
talk
about
him
do
you
want
to
i
pity
the
poor
man
so
good
so
correct
the
lawyer
assures
me
that
he
agrees
to
everything
and
will
not
impose
any
obstacles
they
tell
me
that
he
does
not
come
to
paris
that
he
lives
in
his
factory
our
old
home
is
closed
there
are
times
when
i
feel
remorseful
over
the
way
i
have
treated
and
i
queried
julio
withdrawing
his
hand
you
are
right
she
returned
smiling
you
are
life
it
is
cruel
but
it
is
human
we
have
to
live
our
lives
without
taking
others
into
consideration
it
is
necessary
to
be
selfish
in
order
to
be
the
two
remained
silent
the
remembrance
of
the
husband
had
swept
across
them
like
a
glacial
blast
julio
was
the
first
to
brighten
up
and
you
have
not
danced
in
all
this
time
no
how
could
i
the
very
idea
a
woman
in
divorce
proceedings
i
have
not
been
to
a
single
chic
party
since
you
went
away
i
wanted
to
preserve
a
certain
decorous
mourning
fiesta
how
horrible
it
was
it
needed
you
the
master
they
had
again
clasped
hands
and
were
smiling
memories
of
the
previous
months
were
passing
before
their
eyes
visions
of
their
life
from
five
to
seven
in
the
afternoon
dancing
in
the
hotels
of
the
champs
elysees
where
the
tango
had
been
inexorably
associated
with
a
cup
of
tea
she
appeared
to
tear
herself
away
from
these
recollections
impelled
by
a
tenacious
obsession
which
had
slipped
from
her
mind
in
the
first
moments
of
their
meeting
do
you
know
much
about
what
s
happening
tell
me
all
people
talk
so
much
do
you
really
believe
that
there
will
be
war
don
t
you
think
that
it
will
all
end
in
some
kind
of
settlement
desnoyers
comforted
her
with
his
optimism
he
did
not
believe
in
the
possibility
of
a
war
that
was
ridiculous
i
say
so
too
ours
is
not
the
epoch
of
savages
i
have
known
some
germans
chic
and
persons
who
surely
must
think
exactly
as
we
do
an
old
professor
who
comes
to
the
house
was
explaining
yesterday
to
mama
that
wars
are
no
longer
possible
in
these
progressive
times
in
two
months
time
there
would
scarcely
be
any
men
left
in
three
the
world
would
find
itself
without
money
to
continue
the
struggle
i
do
not
recall
exactly
how
it
was
but
he
explained
it
all
very
clearly
in
a
manner
most
delightful
to
she
reflected
in
silence
trying
to
her
confused
recollections
but
dismayed
by
the
effort
required
added
on
her
own
account
just
imagine
what
war
would
mean
how
horrible
society
life
paralyzed
no
more
parties
nor
clothes
nor
theatres
why
it
is
even
possible
that
they
might
not
design
any
more
fashions
all
the
women
in
mourning
can
you
imagine
it
and
paris
deserted
how
beautiful
it
seemed
as
i
came
to
meet
you
this
afternoon
no
no
it
can
not
be
next
month
you
know
we
go
to
vichy
mama
needs
the
waters
then
to
biarritz
after
that
i
shall
go
to
a
castle
on
the
loire
and
besides
there
are
our
affairs
my
divorce
our
marriage
which
may
take
place
the
next
year
and
is
war
to
hinder
and
cut
short
all
this
no
no
it
is
not
possible
my
brother
and
others
like
him
are
foolish
enough
to
dream
of
danger
from
germany
i
am
sure
that
my
husband
too
who
is
only
interested
in
serious
and
bothersome
matters
is
among
those
who
believe
that
war
is
imminent
and
prepare
to
take
part
in
it
what
nonsense
tell
me
that
it
is
all
nonsense
i
need
to
hear
you
say
tranquilized
by
the
affirmations
of
her
lover
she
then
changed
the
trend
of
the
conversation
the
possibility
of
their
approaching
marriage
brought
to
mind
the
object
of
the
voyage
which
desnoyers
had
just
made
there
had
not
been
time
for
them
to
write
to
each
other
during
their
brief
separation
did
you
succeed
in
getting
the
money
the
joy
of
seeing
you
made
me
forget
all
about
such
things
adopting
the
air
of
a
business
expert
he
replied
that
he
had
brought
back
less
than
he
expected
for
he
had
found
the
country
in
the
throes
of
one
of
its
periodical
panics
but
still
he
had
managed
to
get
together
about
four
hundred
thousand
francs
in
his
purse
he
had
a
check
for
that
amount
later
on
they
would
send
him
further
remittances
a
ranchman
in
argentina
a
sort
of
relative
was
looking
after
his
affairs
marguerite
appeared
satisfied
and
in
spite
of
her
frivolity
adopted
the
air
of
a
serious
woman
money
money
she
exclaimed
sententiously
and
yet
there
is
no
happiness
without
it
with
your
four
hundred
thousand
and
what
i
have
we
shall
be
able
to
get
along
i
told
you
that
my
husband
wishes
to
give
me
back
my
dowry
he
has
told
my
brother
so
but
the
state
of
his
business
and
the
increased
size
of
his
factory
do
not
permit
him
to
return
it
as
quickly
as
he
would
like
i
can
t
help
but
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
man
so
honorable
and
so
upright
in
every
way
if
he
only
were
not
so
commonplace
again
marguerite
seemed
to
regret
these
tardy
spontaneous
eulogies
which
were
chilling
their
interview
so
again
she
changed
the
trend
of
her
chatter
and
your
family
have
you
seen
them
desnoyers
had
been
to
his
father
s
home
before
starting
for
the
chapelle
expiatoire
a
stealthy
entrance
into
the
great
house
on
the
avenue
victor
hugo
and
then
up
to
the
first
floor
like
a
tradesman
then
he
had
slipt
into
the
kitchen
like
a
soldier
sweetheart
of
the
maids
his
mother
had
come
there
to
embrace
him
poor
dona
luisa
weeping
and
kissing
him
frantically
as
though
she
had
feared
to
lose
him
forever
close
behind
her
mother
had
come
luisita
nicknamed
chichi
who
always
surveyed
him
with
sympathetic
curiosity
as
if
she
wished
to
know
better
a
brother
so
bad
and
adorable
who
had
led
decent
women
from
the
paths
of
virtue
and
committed
all
kinds
of
follies
then
desnoyers
had
been
greatly
surprised
to
see
entering
the
kitchen
with
the
air
of
a
tragedy
queen
a
noble
mother
of
the
drama
his
aunt
elena
the
one
who
had
married
a
german
and
was
living
in
berlin
surrounded
with
innumerable
children
she
has
been
in
paris
a
month
she
is
going
to
make
a
little
visit
to
our
castle
and
it
appears
that
her
eldest
son
my
cousin
the
sage
whom
i
have
not
seen
for
years
is
also
coming
the
home
interview
had
several
times
been
interrupted
by
fear
your
father
is
at
home
be
careful
his
mother
had
said
to
him
each
time
that
he
had
spoken
above
a
whisper
and
his
aunt
elena
had
stationed
herself
at
the
door
with
a
dramatic
air
like
a
stage
heroine
resolved
to
plunge
a
dagger
into
the
tyrant
who
should
dare
to
cross
the
threshold
the
entire
family
was
accustomed
to
submit
to
the
rigid
authority
of
don
marcelo
desnoyers
oh
that
old
man
exclaimed
julio
referring
to
his
father
he
may
live
many
years
yet
but
how
he
weighs
upon
us
all
his
mother
who
had
never
wearied
of
looking
at
him
finally
had
to
bring
the
interview
to
an
end
frightened
by
certain
approaching
sounds
go
he
might
surprise
us
and
he
would
be
so
julio
had
fled
the
paternal
home
caressed
by
the
tears
of
the
two
ladies
and
the
admiring
glances
of
chichi
by
turns
ashamed
and
proud
of
a
brother
who
had
caused
such
enthusiasm
and
scandal
among
her
friends
marguerite
also
spoke
of
senor
desnoyers
a
terrible
tyrant
of
the
old
school
with
whom
they
could
never
come
to
an
understanding
the
two
remained
silent
looking
fixedly
at
each
other
now
that
they
had
said
the
things
of
greatest
urgency
present
interests
became
more
absorbing
more
immediate
things
unspoken
seemed
to
well
up
in
their
timid
and
vacillating
eyes
before
escaping
in
the
form
of
words
they
did
not
dare
to
talk
like
lovers
here
every
minute
the
cloud
of
witnesses
seemed
increasing
around
them
the
woman
with
the
dogs
and
the
red
wig
was
passing
with
greater
frequency
shortening
her
turns
through
the
square
in
order
to
greet
them
with
a
smile
of
complicity
the
reader
of
the
daily
paper
was
now
exchanging
views
with
a
friend
on
a
neighboring
bench
regarding
the
possibilities
of
war
the
garden
had
become
a
thoroughfare
the
modistes
upon
going
out
from
their
establishments
and
the
ladies
returning
from
shopping
were
crossing
through
the
square
in
order
to
shorten
their
walk
the
little
avenue
was
a
popular
all
the
pedestrians
were
casting
curious
glances
at
the
elegant
lady
and
her
companion
seated
in
the
shadow
of
the
shrubbery
with
the
timid
yet
natural
look
of
those
who
desire
to
hide
themselves
yet
at
the
same
time
feign
a
casual
air
how
exasperating
sighed
marguerite
they
are
going
to
find
us
out
a
girl
looked
at
her
so
searchingly
that
she
thought
she
recognized
in
her
an
employee
of
a
celebrated
modiste
besides
some
of
her
personal
friends
who
had
met
her
in
the
crowded
shops
but
an
hour
ago
might
be
returning
home
by
way
of
the
garden
let
us
go
she
said
rising
hurriedly
if
they
should
spy
us
here
together
just
think
what
they
might
say
and
just
when
they
are
becoming
a
little
forgetful
desnoyers
protested
crossly
go
away
paris
had
become
a
shrunken
place
for
them
nowadays
because
marguerite
refused
to
go
to
a
single
place
where
there
was
a
possibility
of
their
being
surprised
in
another
square
in
a
restaurant
wherever
they
might
go
they
would
run
the
same
risk
of
being
recognized
she
would
only
consider
meetings
in
public
places
and
yet
at
the
same
time
dreaded
the
curiosity
of
the
people
if
marguerite
would
like
to
go
to
his
studio
of
such
sweet
memories
to
your
home
no
no
indeed
she
replied
emphatically
i
can
not
forget
the
last
time
i
was
but
julio
insisted
foreseeing
a
break
in
that
firm
negative
where
could
they
be
more
comfortable
besides
weren
t
they
going
to
marry
as
soon
as
possible
i
tell
you
no
she
repeated
who
knows
but
my
husband
may
be
watching
me
what
a
complication
for
my
divorce
if
he
should
surprise
us
in
your
house
now
it
was
he
who
eulogized
the
husband
insisting
that
such
watchfulness
was
incompatible
with
his
character
the
engineer
had
accepted
the
facts
considering
them
irreparable
and
was
now
thinking
only
of
reconstructing
his
life
no
it
is
better
for
us
to
separate
she
continued
tomorrow
we
shall
see
each
other
again
you
will
hunt
a
more
favorable
place
think
it
over
and
you
will
find
a
solution
for
it
but
he
wished
an
immediate
solution
they
had
abandoned
their
seats
going
slowly
toward
the
rue
des
mathurins
julio
was
speaking
with
a
trembling
and
persuasive
eloquence
no
now
they
had
only
to
call
a
taxicab
it
would
be
only
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
and
then
the
isolation
the
mystery
the
return
to
a
sweet
past
to
that
intimacy
in
the
studio
where
they
had
passed
their
happiest
hours
they
would
believe
that
no
time
had
elapsed
since
their
first
meetings
no
she
faltered
with
a
weakening
accent
seeking
a
last
resistance
besides
your
secretary
might
be
there
that
spaniard
who
lives
with
you
how
ashamed
i
would
be
to
meet
him
again
julio
laughed
argensola
how
could
that
comrade
who
knew
all
about
their
past
be
an
obstacle
if
they
should
happen
to
meet
him
in
the
house
he
would
be
sure
to
leave
immediately
more
than
once
he
had
had
to
go
out
so
as
not
to
be
in
the
way
his
discretion
was
such
that
he
had
foreseen
events
probably
he
had
already
left
conjecturing
that
a
near
visit
would
be
the
most
logical
thing
his
chum
would
simply
go
wandering
through
the
streets
in
search
of
news
marguerite
was
silent
as
though
yielding
on
seeing
her
pretexts
exhausted
desnoyers
was
silent
too
construing
her
stillness
as
assent
they
had
left
the
garden
and
she
was
looking
around
uneasily
terrified
to
find
herself
in
the
open
street
beside
her
lover
and
seeking
a
suddenly
she
saw
before
her
the
little
red
door
of
an
automobile
opened
by
the
hand
of
her
adorer
get
in
ordered
julio
and
she
climbed
in
hastily
anxious
to
hide
herself
as
soon
as
possible
the
vehicle
started
at
great
speed
marguerite
immediately
pulled
down
the
shade
of
the
window
on
her
side
but
before
she
had
finished
and
could
turn
her
head
she
felt
a
hungry
mouth
kissing
the
nape
of
her
neck
no
not
here
she
said
in
a
pleading
tone
let
us
be
sensible
and
while
he
rebellious
at
these
exhortations
persisted
in
his
advances
the
voice
of
marguerite
again
sounded
above
the
noise
of
the
rattling
machinery
of
the
automobile
as
it
bounded
over
the
pavement
do
you
really
believe
that
there
will
be
no
war
do
you
believe
that
we
will
be
able
to
marry
tell
me
again
i
want
you
to
encourage
me
i
need
to
hear
it
from
your
chapter
ii
madariaga
the
centaur
in
marcelo
desnoyers
was
nineteen
years
old
he
was
born
in
the
suburbs
of
paris
an
only
child
his
father
interested
in
little
building
speculations
maintained
his
family
in
modest
comfort
the
mason
wished
to
make
an
architect
of
his
son
and
marcelo
was
in
the
midst
of
his
preparatory
studies
when
his
father
suddenly
died
leaving
his
affairs
greatly
involved
in
a
few
months
he
and
his
mother
descended
the
slopes
of
ruin
and
were
obliged
to
give
up
their
snug
quarters
and
live
like
laborers
when
the
boy
had
to
choose
a
trade
he
learned
wood
carving
this
craft
was
an
art
related
to
the
tastes
awakened
in
marcelo
by
his
abandoned
studies
his
mother
retired
to
the
country
living
with
some
relatives
while
the
lad
advanced
rapidly
in
the
shops
aiding
his
master
in
all
the
important
orders
which
he
received
from
the
provinces
the
first
news
of
the
war
with
prussia
surprised
him
in
marseilles
working
on
the
decorations
of
a
theatre
marcelo
was
opposed
to
the
empire
like
all
the
youths
of
his
generation
he
was
also
much
influenced
by
the
older
workmen
who
had
taken
part
in
the
republic
of
and
who
still
retained
vivid
recollections
of
the
coup
d
etat
of
the
second
of
december
one
day
he
saw
in
the
streets
of
marseilles
a
popular
manifestation
in
favor
of
peace
which
was
practically
a
protest
against
the
government
the
old
republicans
in
their
implacable
struggle
with
the
emperor
the
companies
of
the
international
which
had
just
been
organized
and
a
great
number
of
italians
and
spaniards
who
had
fled
their
countries
on
account
of
recent
insurrections
composed
the
procession
a
consumptive
student
was
carrying
the
flag
it
is
peace
that
we
want
a
peace
which
may
unite
all
mankind
chanted
the
paraders
but
on
this
earth
the
noblest
propositions
are
seldom
heard
since
destiny
amuses
herself
in
perverting
them
and
turning
them
aside
scarcely
had
the
friends
of
peace
entered
the
rue
cannebiere
with
their
hymn
and
standard
when
war
came
to
meet
them
obliging
them
to
resort
to
fist
and
club
the
day
before
some
battalions
of
zouaves
from
algiers
had
disembarked
in
order
to
reinforce
the
army
on
the
frontier
and
these
veterans
accustomed
to
colonial
existence
and
undiscriminating
as
to
the
cause
of
disturbances
seized
the
opportunity
to
intervene
in
this
manifestation
some
with
bayonets
and
others
with
ungirded
belts
hurrah
for
war
and
a
rain
of
lashes
and
blows
fell
upon
the
unarmed
singers
marcelo
saw
the
innocent
student
the
of
peace
knocked
down
wrapped
in
his
flag
by
the
merry
kicks
of
the
zouaves
then
he
knew
no
more
since
he
had
received
various
blows
with
a
leather
strap
and
a
knife
thrust
in
his
shoulder
he
had
to
run
the
same
as
the
others
that
day
developed
for
the
first
time
his
fiery
stubborn
character
irritable
before
contradiction
even
to
the
point
of
adopting
the
most
extreme
resolution
down
with
war
since
it
was
not
possible
for
him
to
protest
in
any
other
way
he
would
leave
the
country
the
emperor
might
arrange
his
affairs
as
best
he
could
the
struggle
was
going
to
be
long
and
disastrous
according
to
the
enemies
of
the
empire
if
he
stayed
he
would
in
a
few
months
be
drawn
for
the
soldiery
desnoyers
renounced
the
honor
of
serving
the
emperor
he
hesitated
a
little
when
he
thought
of
his
mother
but
his
country
relatives
would
not
turn
her
out
and
he
planned
to
work
very
hard
and
send
her
money
who
knew
what
riches
might
be
waiting
for
him
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
france
thanks
to
his
savings
a
harbor
official
found
it
to
his
interest
to
offer
him
the
choice
of
three
boats
one
was
sailing
to
egypt
another
to
australia
another
to
montevideo
and
buenos
aires
which
made
the
strongest
appeal
to
him
desnoyers
remembering
his
readings
wished
to
consult
the
wind
and
follow
the
course
that
it
indicated
as
he
had
seen
various
heroes
of
novels
do
but
that
day
the
wind
blew
from
the
sea
toward
france
he
also
wished
to
toss
up
a
coin
in
order
to
test
his
fate
finally
he
decided
upon
the
vessel
sailing
first
not
until
with
his
scanty
baggage
he
was
actually
on
the
deck
of
the
next
boat
to
anchor
did
he
take
any
interest
in
its
course
for
the
rio
de
la
and
he
accepted
these
words
with
a
fatalistic
shrug
very
well
let
it
be
south
america
the
country
was
not
distasteful
to
him
since
he
knew
it
by
certain
travel
publications
whose
illustrations
represented
herds
of
cattle
at
liberty
plumed
indians
and
hairy
cowboys
whirling
over
their
heads
serpentine
lassos
tipped
with
balls
the
millionaire
desnoyers
never
forgot
that
trip
to
america
days
navigating
in
a
little
steamer
that
rattled
like
a
heap
of
old
iron
groaned
in
all
its
joints
at
the
slightest
roughness
of
the
sea
and
had
to
stop
four
times
for
repairs
at
the
mercy
of
the
winds
and
waves
in
montevideo
he
learned
of
the
reverses
suffered
by
his
country
and
that
the
french
empire
no
longer
existed
he
felt
a
little
ashamed
when
he
heard
that
the
nation
was
now
defending
itself
gallantly
behind
the
walls
of
paris
and
he
had
fled
months
afterwards
the
events
of
the
commune
consoled
him
for
his
flight
if
he
had
remained
wrath
at
the
national
downfall
his
relations
with
his
the
air
in
which
he
lived
everything
would
surely
have
dragged
him
along
to
revolt
in
that
case
he
would
have
been
shot
or
consigned
to
a
colonial
prison
like
so
many
of
his
former
comrades
so
his
determination
crystallized
and
he
stopped
thinking
about
the
affairs
of
his
the
necessities
of
existence
in
a
foreign
land
whose
language
he
was
beginning
to
pick
up
made
him
think
only
of
himself
the
turbulent
and
adventurous
life
of
these
new
nations
compelled
him
to
most
absurd
expedients
and
varied
occupations
yet
he
felt
himself
strong
with
an
audacity
and
which
he
never
had
in
the
old
world
i
am
equal
to
everything
he
said
if
they
only
give
me
time
to
prove
it
although
he
had
fled
from
his
country
in
order
not
to
take
up
arms
he
even
led
a
soldier
s
life
for
a
brief
period
in
his
adopted
land
receiving
a
wound
in
one
of
the
many
hostilities
between
the
whites
and
reds
in
the
unsettled
districts
in
buenos
aires
he
again
worked
as
a
woodcarver
the
city
was
beginning
to
expand
breaking
its
shell
as
a
large
village
desnoyers
spent
many
years
ornamenting
salons
and
facades
it
was
a
laborious
existence
sedentary
and
remunerative
but
one
day
he
became
tired
of
this
slow
saving
which
could
only
bring
him
a
mediocre
fortune
after
a
long
time
he
had
gone
to
the
new
world
to
become
rich
like
so
many
others
and
at
he
started
forth
again
a
adventurer
avoiding
the
cities
wishing
to
snatch
money
from
untapped
natural
sources
he
worked
farms
in
the
forests
of
the
north
but
the
locusts
obliterated
his
crops
in
a
few
hours
he
was
a
with
the
aid
of
only
two
peons
driving
a
herd
of
oxen
and
mules
over
the
snowy
solitudes
of
the
andes
to
bolivia
and
chile
in
this
life
making
journeys
of
many
months
duration
across
interminable
plains
he
lost
exact
account
of
time
and
space
just
as
he
thought
himself
on
the
verge
of
winning
a
fortune
he
lost
it
all
by
an
unfortunate
speculation
and
in
a
moment
of
failure
and
despair
being
now
thirty
years
old
he
became
an
employee
of
julio
madariaga
he
knew
of
this
rustic
millionaire
through
his
purchases
of
flocks
a
spaniard
who
had
come
to
the
country
when
very
young
adapting
himself
very
easily
to
its
customs
and
living
like
a
cowboy
after
he
had
acquired
enormous
properties
the
country
folk
wishing
to
put
a
title
of
respect
before
his
name
called
him
don
madariaga
comrade
he
said
to
desnoyers
one
day
when
he
happened
to
be
in
a
good
humor
a
very
rare
thing
for
him
you
must
have
passed
through
many
ups
and
downs
your
lack
of
silver
may
be
smelled
a
long
ways
off
why
lead
such
a
dog
s
life
trust
in
me
frenchy
and
remain
here
i
am
growing
old
and
i
need
a
after
the
frenchman
had
arranged
to
stay
with
madariaga
every
landed
proprietor
living
within
fifteen
or
twenty
leagues
of
the
ranch
stopped
the
new
employee
on
the
road
to
prophesy
all
sorts
of
misfortune
you
will
not
stay
long
nobody
can
get
along
with
don
madariaga
we
have
lost
count
of
his
overseers
he
is
a
man
who
must
be
killed
or
deserted
soon
you
will
go
too
desnoyers
did
not
doubt
but
that
there
was
some
truth
in
all
this
madariaga
was
an
impossible
character
but
feeling
a
certain
sympathy
with
the
frenchman
had
tried
not
to
annoy
him
with
his
irritability
he
s
a
regular
pearl
this
frenchy
said
the
plainsman
as
though
trying
to
excuse
himself
for
his
considerate
treatment
of
his
latest
acquisition
i
like
him
because
he
is
very
serious
that
is
the
way
i
like
a
desnoyers
did
not
know
exactly
what
this
seriousness
could
be
but
he
felt
a
secret
pride
in
seeing
him
aggressive
with
everybody
else
even
his
family
whilst
he
took
with
him
a
tone
of
paternal
bluffness
the
family
consisted
of
his
wife
misia
petrona
whom
he
always
called
the
china
and
two
grown
daughters
who
had
gone
to
school
in
buenos
aires
but
on
returning
to
the
ranch
had
reverted
somewhat
to
their
original
rusticity
madariaga
s
fortune
was
enormous
he
had
lived
in
the
field
since
his
arrival
in
america
when
the
white
race
had
not
dared
to
settle
outside
the
towns
for
fear
of
the
indians
he
had
gained
his
first
money
as
a
fearless
trader
taking
merchandise
in
a
cart
from
fort
to
fort
he
had
killed
indians
was
twice
wounded
by
them
and
for
a
while
had
lived
as
a
captive
with
an
indian
chief
whom
he
finally
succeeded
in
making
his
staunch
friend
with
his
earnings
he
had
bought
land
much
land
almost
worthless
because
of
its
insecurity
devoting
it
to
the
raising
of
cattle
that
he
had
to
defend
gun
in
hand
from
the
pirates
of
the
plains
then
he
had
married
his
china
a
young
who
was
running
around
barefoot
but
owned
many
of
her
forefathers
fields
they
had
lived
in
an
almost
savage
poverty
on
their
property
which
would
have
taken
many
a
day
s
journey
to
go
around
afterwards
when
the
government
was
pushing
the
indians
towards
the
frontiers
and
offering
the
abandoned
lands
for
sale
considering
it
a
patriotic
sacrifice
on
the
part
of
any
one
wishing
to
acquire
them
madariaga
bought
and
bought
at
the
lowest
figure
and
longest
terms
to
get
possession
of
vast
tracts
and
populate
it
with
blooded
stock
became
the
mission
of
his
life
at
times
galloping
with
desnoyers
through
his
boundless
fields
he
was
not
able
to
repress
his
pride
tell
me
something
frenchy
they
say
that
further
up
the
country
there
are
some
nations
about
the
size
of
my
ranches
is
that
so
the
frenchman
agreed
the
lands
of
madariaga
were
indeed
greater
than
many
principalities
this
put
the
old
plainsman
in
rare
good
humor
and
he
exclaimed
in
the
cowboy
vernacular
which
had
become
second
nature
to
him
then
it
wouldn
t
be
absurd
to
proclaim
myself
king
some
day
just
imagine
it
frenchy
don
madariaga
the
first
the
worst
of
it
all
is
that
i
would
also
be
the
last
for
the
china
will
not
give
me
a
son
she
is
a
weak
cow
the
fame
of
his
vast
territories
and
his
wealth
in
stock
reached
even
to
buenos
aires
every
one
knew
of
madariaga
by
name
although
very
few
had
seen
him
when
he
went
to
the
capital
he
passed
unnoticed
because
of
his
country
aspect
the
same
leggings
that
he
was
used
to
wearing
in
the
fields
his
poncho
wrapped
around
him
like
a
muffler
above
which
rose
the
aggressive
points
of
a
necktie
a
tormenting
ornament
imposed
by
his
daughters
who
in
vain
arranged
it
with
loving
hands
that
he
might
look
a
little
more
respectable
one
day
he
entered
the
office
of
the
richest
merchant
of
the
capital
sir
i
know
that
you
need
some
young
bulls
for
the
european
market
and
i
have
come
to
sell
you
a
the
man
of
affairs
looked
haughtily
at
the
poor
cowboy
he
might
explain
his
errand
to
one
of
the
employees
he
could
not
waste
his
time
on
such
small
matters
but
the
malicious
grin
on
the
rustic
s
face
awoke
his
curiosity
and
how
many
are
you
able
to
sell
my
good
man
about
thirty
thousand
it
was
not
necessary
to
hear
more
the
supercilious
merchant
sprang
from
his
desk
and
obsequiously
offered
him
a
seat
you
can
be
no
other
than
don
at
the
service
of
god
and
yourself
sir
he
responded
in
the
manner
of
a
spanish
countryman
that
was
the
most
glorious
moment
of
his
existence
in
the
outer
office
of
the
directors
of
the
bank
the
clerks
offered
him
a
seat
until
the
personage
the
other
side
of
the
door
should
deign
to
receive
him
but
scarcely
was
his
name
announced
than
that
same
director
ran
to
admit
him
and
the
employee
was
stupefied
to
hear
the
ranchman
say
by
way
of
greeting
i
have
come
to
draw
out
three
hundred
thousand
dollars
i
have
abundant
pasturage
and
i
wish
to
buy
a
ranch
or
two
in
order
to
stock
his
arbitrary
and
contradictory
character
weighed
upon
the
inhabitants
of
his
lands
with
both
cruel
and
tyranny
no
vagabond
ever
passed
by
the
ranch
without
being
rudely
assailed
by
its
owner
from
the
outset
don
t
tell
me
any
of
your
stories
friend
he
would
yell
as
if
he
were
going
to
beat
him
under
the
shed
is
a
skinned
beast
cut
and
eat
as
much
as
you
wish
and
so
help
yourself
to
continue
your
journey
but
no
more
of
your
yarns
and
he
would
turn
his
back
upon
the
tramp
after
giving
him
a
few
dollars
one
day
he
became
infuriated
because
a
peon
was
nailing
the
wire
fencing
too
deliberately
on
the
posts
everybody
was
robbing
him
the
following
day
he
spoke
of
a
large
sum
of
money
that
he
would
have
to
pay
for
having
endorsed
the
note
of
an
acquaintance
completely
bankrupt
poor
fellow
his
luck
is
worse
than
mine
upon
finding
in
the
road
the
skeleton
of
a
recently
killed
sheep
he
was
beside
himself
with
indignation
it
was
not
because
of
the
loss
of
the
meat
hunger
knows
no
law
and
god
has
made
meat
for
mankind
to
eat
but
they
might
at
least
have
left
the
skin
and
he
would
rage
against
such
wickedness
always
repeating
lack
of
religion
and
good
habits
the
next
time
the
bandits
stripped
the
flesh
off
of
three
cows
leaving
the
skins
in
full
view
and
the
ranchman
said
smiling
that
is
the
way
i
like
people
honorable
and
doing
no
his
vigor
as
a
tireless
centaur
had
helped
him
powerfully
in
his
task
of
populating
his
lands
he
was
capricious
despotic
and
with
the
same
paternal
instincts
as
his
compatriots
who
centuries
before
when
conquering
the
new
world
had
clarified
its
native
blood
like
the
castilian
conquistadors
he
had
a
fancy
for
beauty
with
oblique
eyes
and
straight
hair
when
desnoyers
saw
him
going
off
on
some
sudden
pretext
putting
his
horse
at
full
gallop
toward
a
neighboring
ranch
he
would
say
to
himself
smilingly
he
is
going
in
search
of
a
new
peon
who
will
help
work
his
land
fifteen
years
from
the
personnel
of
the
ranch
often
used
to
comment
on
the
resemblance
of
certain
youths
laboring
here
the
same
as
the
others
galloping
from
the
first
streak
of
dawn
over
the
fields
attending
to
the
various
duties
of
pasturing
the
overseer
celedonio
a
thirty
years
old
generally
detested
for
his
hard
and
avaricious
character
also
bore
a
distant
resemblance
to
the
patron
almost
every
year
some
woman
from
a
great
distance
dirty
and
presented
herself
at
the
ranch
leading
by
the
hand
a
little
mongrel
with
eyes
like
live
coals
she
would
ask
to
speak
with
the
proprietor
alone
and
upon
being
confronted
with
her
he
usually
recalled
a
trip
made
ten
or
twelve
years
before
in
order
to
buy
a
herd
of
cattle
you
remember
patron
that
you
passed
the
night
on
my
ranch
because
the
river
had
risen
the
patron
did
not
remember
anything
about
it
but
a
vague
instinct
warned
him
that
the
woman
was
probably
telling
the
truth
well
what
of
it
patron
here
he
is
it
is
better
for
him
to
grow
to
manhood
by
your
side
than
in
any
other
and
she
presented
him
with
the
little
hybrid
one
more
and
offered
with
such
simplicity
lack
of
religion
and
good
habits
then
with
sudden
modesty
he
doubted
the
woman
s
veracity
why
must
it
necessarily
be
his
but
his
wavering
was
generally
if
it
s
mine
put
it
with
the
the
mother
went
away
tranquilly
seeing
the
youngster
s
future
assured
because
this
man
so
lavish
in
violence
was
equally
so
in
generosity
in
time
there
would
be
a
bit
of
land
and
a
good
flock
of
sheep
for
the
urchin
these
adoptions
at
first
aroused
in
misia
petrona
a
little
rebellion
the
only
ones
of
her
life
but
the
centaur
soon
reduced
her
to
terrified
silence
and
you
dare
to
complain
of
me
you
weak
cow
a
woman
who
has
only
given
me
daughters
you
ought
to
be
ashamed
of
the
same
hand
that
negligently
extracted
from
his
pocket
a
wad
of
bills
rolled
into
a
ball
giving
them
away
capriciously
without
knowing
just
how
much
also
wore
a
lash
hanging
from
the
wrist
it
was
supposed
to
be
for
his
horse
but
it
was
used
with
equal
facility
when
any
of
his
peons
incurred
his
wrath
i
strike
because
i
can
he
would
say
to
pacify
himself
one
day
the
man
receiving
the
blow
took
a
step
backward
hunting
for
the
knife
in
his
belt
you
are
not
going
to
beat
me
patron
i
was
not
born
in
these
parts
i
come
from
the
patron
remained
with
upraised
thong
is
it
true
that
you
were
not
born
here
then
you
are
right
i
can
not
beat
you
here
are
five
dollars
for
when
desnoyers
came
on
the
place
madariaga
was
beginning
to
lose
count
of
those
who
were
under
his
dominion
in
the
old
latin
sense
and
could
take
his
blows
there
were
so
many
that
confusion
often
reigned
the
frenchman
admired
the
patron
s
expert
eye
for
his
business
it
was
enough
for
him
to
contemplate
for
a
few
moments
a
herd
of
cattle
to
know
its
exact
number
he
would
go
galloping
along
with
an
indifferent
air
around
an
immense
group
of
horned
and
stamping
beasts
and
then
would
suddenly
begin
to
separate
the
different
animals
he
had
discovered
that
they
were
sick
with
a
buyer
like
madariaga
all
the
tricks
and
sharp
practice
of
the
drovers
came
to
naught
his
serenity
before
trouble
was
also
admirable
a
drought
suddenly
strewed
his
plains
with
dead
cattle
making
the
land
seem
like
an
abandoned
battlefield
everywhere
great
black
hulks
in
the
air
great
spirals
of
crows
coming
from
leagues
away
at
other
times
it
was
the
cold
an
unexpected
drop
in
the
thermometer
would
cover
the
ground
with
dead
bodies
ten
thousand
animals
fifteen
thousand
perhaps
more
all
perished
what
a
madariaga
would
exclaim
with
resignation
without
such
troubles
this
earth
would
be
a
paradise
now
the
thing
to
do
is
to
save
the
skins
and
he
would
rail
against
the
false
pride
of
the
emigrants
against
the
new
customs
among
the
poor
which
prevented
his
securing
enough
hands
to
strip
the
victims
quickly
so
that
thousands
of
hides
had
to
be
lost
their
bones
whitened
the
earth
like
heaps
of
snow
the
peoncitos
little
peons
went
around
putting
the
skulls
of
cows
with
crumpled
horns
on
the
posts
of
the
wire
fences
a
rustic
decoration
which
suggested
a
procession
of
grecian
lyres
it
is
lucky
that
the
land
is
left
anyway
added
the
ranchman
he
loved
to
race
around
his
immense
fields
when
they
were
beginning
to
turn
green
in
the
late
rains
he
had
been
among
the
first
to
convert
these
virgin
wastes
into
rich
supplementing
the
natural
pasturage
with
alfalfa
where
one
beast
had
found
sustenance
before
he
now
had
three
the
table
is
set
he
would
chuckle
we
must
now
go
in
search
of
the
and
he
kept
on
buying
at
ridiculous
prices
herds
dying
of
hunger
in
others
uncultivated
fields
constantly
increasing
his
opulent
lands
and
stock
one
morning
desnoyers
saved
his
life
the
old
ranchman
had
raised
his
lash
against
a
recently
arrived
peon
who
returned
the
attack
knife
in
hand
madariaga
was
defending
himself
as
best
he
could
convinced
from
one
minute
to
another
that
he
was
going
to
receive
the
deadly
when
desnoyers
arrived
and
drawing
his
revolver
overcame
and
disarmed
the
adversary
thanks
frenchy
said
the
ranchman
much
touched
you
are
an
man
and
i
am
going
to
reward
you
from
this
day
i
shall
speak
to
you
as
i
do
to
my
desnoyers
did
not
know
just
what
this
familiar
talk
might
amount
to
for
his
employer
was
so
peculiar
certain
personal
favors
nevertheless
immediately
began
to
improve
his
position
he
was
no
longer
allowed
to
eat
in
the
administration
building
the
proprietor
insisting
imperiously
that
henceforth
desnoyers
should
sit
at
his
own
table
and
thus
he
was
admitted
into
the
intimate
life
of
the
madariaga
family
the
wife
was
always
silent
when
her
husband
was
present
she
was
used
to
rising
in
the
middle
of
the
night
in
order
to
oversee
the
breakfasts
of
the
peons
the
distribution
of
biscuit
and
the
boiling
of
the
great
black
kettles
of
coffee
or
shrub
tea
she
looked
after
the
chattering
and
lazy
maids
who
so
easily
managed
to
get
lost
in
the
nearby
groves
in
the
kitchen
too
she
made
her
authority
felt
like
a
regular
but
the
minute
that
she
heard
her
husband
s
voice
she
shrank
into
a
respectful
and
timorous
silence
upon
sitting
down
at
table
the
china
would
look
at
him
with
devoted
submission
her
great
round
eyes
fixed
on
him
like
an
owl
s
desnoyers
felt
that
in
this
mute
admiration
was
mingled
great
astonishment
at
the
energy
with
which
the
ranchman
already
over
seventy
was
continuing
to
bring
new
occupants
to
live
on
his
demesne
the
two
daughters
luisa
and
elena
accepted
with
enthusiasm
the
new
arrival
who
came
to
enliven
the
monotonous
conversations
in
the
dining
room
so
often
cut
short
by
their
father
s
wrathful
outbursts
besides
he
was
from
paris
paris
sighed
elena
the
younger
one
rolling
her
eyes
and
desnoyers
was
henceforth
consulted
in
all
matters
of
style
every
time
they
ordered
any
confections
from
the
shops
of
buenos
aires
the
interior
of
the
house
reflected
the
different
tastes
of
the
two
generations
the
girls
had
a
parlor
with
a
few
handsome
pieces
of
furniture
placed
against
the
cracked
walls
and
some
showy
lamps
that
were
never
lighted
the
father
with
his
boorishness
often
invaded
this
room
so
cherished
and
admired
by
the
two
sisters
making
the
carpets
look
shabby
and
faded
under
his
muddy
upon
the
gilt
he
loved
to
lay
his
lash
samples
of
maize
scattered
its
grains
over
a
silk
sofa
which
the
young
ladies
tried
to
keep
very
choice
as
though
they
feared
it
might
break
near
the
entrance
to
the
dining
room
was
a
weighing
machine
and
madariaga
became
furious
when
his
daughters
asked
him
to
remove
it
to
the
offices
he
was
not
going
to
trouble
himself
to
go
outside
every
time
that
he
wanted
to
know
the
weight
of
a
leather
skin
a
piano
came
into
the
ranch
and
elena
passed
the
hours
practising
exercises
with
desperate
good
will
heavens
and
earth
she
might
at
least
play
the
jota
or
the
perican
or
some
other
lively
spanish
dance
and
the
irate
father
at
the
hour
of
siesta
betook
himself
to
the
nearby
eucalyptus
trees
to
sleep
upon
his
poncho
this
younger
daughter
whom
he
dubbed
la
romantica
was
the
special
victim
of
his
wrath
and
ridicule
where
had
she
picked
up
so
many
tastes
which
he
and
his
good
china
never
had
had
music
books
were
piled
on
the
piano
in
a
corner
of
the
absurd
parlor
were
some
wooden
boxes
that
had
held
preserves
which
the
ranch
carpenter
had
been
made
to
press
into
service
as
a
bookcase
look
here
frenchy
scoffed
madariaga
all
these
are
novels
and
poems
pure
lies
hot
air
he
had
his
private
library
vastly
more
important
and
glorious
and
occupying
less
space
in
his
desk
adorned
with
guns
thongs
and
chaps
studded
with
silver
was
a
little
compartment
containing
deeds
and
various
legal
documents
which
the
ranchman
surveyed
with
great
pride
pay
attention
now
and
hear
marvellous
things
announced
the
master
to
desnoyers
as
he
took
out
one
of
his
memorandum
books
this
volume
contained
the
pedigree
of
the
famous
animals
which
had
improved
his
breeds
of
stock
the
genealogical
trees
the
patents
of
nobility
of
his
aristocratic
beasts
he
would
have
to
read
its
contents
to
him
since
he
did
not
permit
even
his
family
to
touch
these
records
and
with
his
spectacles
on
the
end
of
his
nose
he
would
spell
out
the
credentials
of
each
animal
celebrity
diamond
iii
grandson
of
diamond
i
owned
by
the
king
of
england
son
of
diamond
ii
winner
in
the
his
diamond
had
cost
him
many
thousands
but
the
finest
horses
on
the
ranch
those
which
brought
the
most
marvellous
prices
were
his
descendants
that
horse
had
more
sense
than
most
people
he
only
lacked
the
power
to
talk
he
s
the
one
that
s
stuffed
near
the
door
of
the
parlor
the
girls
wanted
him
thrown
out
just
let
them
dare
to
touch
him
i
d
chuck
them
out
first
then
he
would
continue
reading
the
history
of
a
dynasty
of
bulls
with
distinctive
names
and
a
succession
of
roman
numbers
the
same
as
kings
animals
acquired
by
the
stubborn
ranchman
in
the
great
cattle
fairs
of
england
he
had
never
been
there
but
he
had
used
the
cable
in
order
to
compete
in
pounds
sterling
with
the
british
owners
who
wished
to
keep
such
valuable
stock
in
their
own
country
thanks
to
these
sires
that
had
crossed
the
ocean
with
all
the
luxury
of
millionaire
passengers
he
had
been
able
to
exhibit
in
the
concourses
of
buenos
aires
animals
which
were
veritable
towers
of
meat
edible
elephants
with
their
sides
as
fit
and
sleek
as
a
table
that
book
amounts
to
something
don
t
you
think
so
frenchy
it
is
worth
more
than
all
those
pictures
of
moons
lakes
lovers
and
other
gewgaws
that
my
romantica
puts
on
the
walls
to
catch
the
and
he
would
point
out
in
contrast
the
precious
diplomas
which
were
adorning
his
desk
the
metal
vases
and
other
trophies
won
in
the
fairs
by
the
descendants
of
his
blooded
stock
luisa
the
elder
daughter
called
chicha
in
the
south
american
fashion
was
much
more
respected
by
her
father
she
is
my
poor
china
right
over
again
he
said
the
same
good
nature
and
the
same
faculty
for
work
but
more
of
a
desnoyers
entirely
agreed
with
him
and
yet
the
father
s
description
seemed
to
him
weak
and
incomplete
he
could
not
admit
that
the
pale
modest
girl
with
the
great
black
eyes
and
smile
of
childish
mischief
bore
the
slightest
resemblance
to
the
respectable
matron
who
had
brought
her
into
existence
the
great
fiesta
for
chicha
was
the
sunday
mass
it
represented
a
journey
of
three
leagues
to
the
nearest
village
a
weekly
contact
with
people
unlike
those
of
the
ranch
a
carriage
drawn
by
four
horses
took
the
senora
and
the
two
senoritas
in
the
latest
suits
and
hats
arrived
via
buenos
aires
from
europe
at
the
suggestion
of
chicha
desnoyers
accompanied
them
in
the
capacity
of
driver
the
father
remained
at
home
taking
advantage
of
this
opportunity
to
survey
his
fields
in
their
sunday
solitude
thus
keeping
a
closer
oversight
on
the
shiftlessness
of
his
hands
he
was
very
religious
religion
and
good
manners
you
but
had
he
not
given
thousands
of
dollars
toward
building
the
neighboring
church
a
man
of
his
fortune
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
same
obligations
as
ragamuffins
during
the
sunday
lunch
the
young
ladies
were
apt
to
make
comments
upon
the
persons
and
merits
of
the
young
men
of
the
village
and
neighboring
ranches
who
had
lingered
at
the
church
door
in
order
to
chat
with
them
don
t
fool
yourselves
girls
observed
the
father
shrewdly
you
believe
that
they
want
you
for
your
elegance
don
t
you
what
those
shameless
fellows
really
want
are
the
dollars
of
old
madariaga
and
once
they
had
them
they
would
probably
give
you
a
daily
for
a
while
the
ranch
received
numerous
visitors
some
were
young
men
of
the
neighborhood
who
arrived
on
spirited
steeds
performing
all
kinds
of
tricks
of
fancy
horsemanship
they
wanted
to
see
don
julio
on
the
most
absurd
pretexts
and
at
the
same
time
improved
the
opportunity
to
chat
with
chicha
and
luisa
at
other
times
they
were
youths
from
buenos
aires
asking
for
a
lodging
at
the
ranch
as
they
were
just
passing
by
don
madariaga
would
growl
another
scamp
who
comes
in
search
of
the
spanish
ranchman
if
he
doesn
t
move
on
soon
i
ll
kick
him
out
but
the
suitor
did
not
stand
long
on
the
order
of
his
going
intimidated
by
the
ominous
silence
of
the
patron
this
silence
of
late
had
persisted
in
an
alarming
manner
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
ranch
was
no
longer
receiving
visitors
madariaga
appeared
abstracted
and
all
the
family
including
desnoyers
respected
and
feared
this
taciturnity
he
ate
scowling
with
lowered
head
suddenly
he
would
raise
his
eyes
looking
at
chicha
then
at
desnoyers
finally
fixing
them
upon
his
wife
as
though
asking
her
to
give
an
account
of
things
his
romantica
simply
did
not
exist
for
him
the
only
notice
that
he
ever
took
of
her
was
to
give
an
ironical
snort
when
he
happened
to
see
her
leaning
at
sunset
against
the
doorway
looking
at
the
reddening
glow
one
elbow
on
the
door
frame
and
her
cheek
in
her
hand
in
imitation
of
the
posture
of
a
certain
white
lady
that
she
had
seen
in
a
chromo
awaiting
the
knight
of
her
dreams
desnoyers
had
been
five
years
in
the
house
when
one
day
he
entered
his
master
s
private
office
with
the
brusque
air
of
a
timid
person
who
has
suddenly
reached
a
decision
don
julio
i
am
going
to
leave
and
i
would
like
our
accounts
madariaga
looked
at
him
slyly
going
to
leave
eh
what
for
but
in
vain
he
repeated
his
questions
the
frenchman
was
floundering
through
a
series
of
incoherent
explanations
i
m
going
i
ve
got
to
ah
you
thief
you
false
prophet
shouted
the
ranchman
in
stentorian
tones
but
desnoyers
did
not
quail
before
the
insults
he
had
often
heard
his
patron
use
these
same
words
when
holding
somebody
up
to
ridicule
or
haggling
with
certain
cattle
drovers
ah
you
thief
you
false
prophet
do
you
suppose
that
i
do
not
know
why
you
are
going
do
you
suppose
old
madariaga
has
not
seen
your
languishing
looks
and
those
of
my
dead
fly
of
a
daughter
clasping
each
others
hands
in
the
presence
of
poor
china
who
is
blinded
in
her
judgment
it
s
not
such
a
bad
stroke
frenchy
by
it
you
would
be
able
to
get
possession
of
half
of
the
old
spaniard
s
dollars
and
then
say
that
you
had
made
it
in
and
while
he
was
storming
or
rather
howling
all
this
he
had
grasped
his
lash
and
with
the
butt
end
kept
poking
his
manager
in
the
stomach
with
such
insistence
that
it
might
be
construed
in
an
affectionate
or
hostile
way
for
this
reason
i
have
come
to
bid
you
said
desnoyers
haughtily
i
know
that
my
love
is
absurd
and
i
wish
to
the
gentleman
would
go
away
the
ranchman
continued
spluttering
the
gentleman
believes
that
here
one
can
do
what
one
pleases
no
siree
here
nobody
commands
but
old
madariaga
and
i
order
you
to
stay
ah
these
women
they
only
serve
to
antagonize
men
and
yet
we
can
t
live
without
them
he
took
several
turns
up
and
down
the
room
as
though
his
last
words
were
making
him
think
of
something
very
different
from
what
he
had
just
been
saying
desnoyers
looked
uneasily
at
the
thong
which
was
still
hanging
from
his
wrist
suppose
he
should
attempt
to
whip
him
as
he
did
the
peons
he
was
still
undecided
whether
to
hold
his
own
against
a
man
who
had
always
treated
him
with
benevolence
or
while
his
back
was
turned
to
take
refuge
in
discreet
flight
when
the
ranchman
planted
himself
before
him
you
really
love
her
really
he
asked
are
you
sure
that
she
loves
you
be
careful
what
you
say
for
love
is
blind
and
deceitful
i
too
when
i
married
my
china
was
crazy
about
her
do
you
love
her
honestly
and
truly
well
then
take
her
you
devilish
frenchy
somebody
has
to
take
her
and
may
she
not
turn
out
a
weak
cow
like
her
mother
let
us
have
the
ranch
full
of
grandchildren
in
voicing
this
s
wish
again
appeared
the
great
breeder
of
beasts
and
men
and
as
though
he
considered
it
necessary
to
explain
his
concession
he
added
i
do
all
this
because
i
like
you
and
i
like
you
because
you
are
again
the
frenchman
was
plunged
in
doubt
not
knowing
in
just
what
this
greatly
appreciated
seriousness
consisted
at
his
wedding
desnoyers
thought
much
of
his
mother
if
only
the
poor
old
woman
could
witness
this
extraordinary
stroke
of
good
fortune
but
she
had
died
the
year
before
believing
her
son
enormously
rich
because
he
had
been
sending
her
sixty
dollars
every
month
taken
from
the
wages
that
he
had
earned
on
the
ranch
desnoyers
entrance
into
the
family
made
his
pay
less
attention
to
business
city
life
with
all
its
untried
enchantments
and
snares
now
attracted
madariaga
and
he
began
to
speak
with
contempt
of
country
women
poorly
groomed
and
inspiring
him
with
disgust
he
had
given
up
his
cowboy
attire
and
was
displaying
with
childish
satisfaction
the
new
suits
in
which
a
tailor
of
the
capital
was
trying
to
disguise
him
when
elena
wished
to
accompany
him
to
buenos
aires
he
would
wriggle
out
of
it
trumping
up
some
absorbing
business
no
you
go
with
your
the
fate
of
his
fields
and
flocks
gave
him
no
uneasiness
his
fortune
managed
by
desnoyers
was
in
good
hands
he
is
very
serious
again
affirmed
the
old
spaniard
to
his
family
assembled
in
the
dining
roam
as
serious
as
i
am
nobody
can
make
a
fool
of
him
and
finally
the
frenchman
concluded
that
when
his
spoke
of
seriousness
he
was
referring
to
his
strength
of
character
according
to
the
spontaneous
declaration
of
madariaga
he
had
from
the
very
first
day
that
he
had
dealings
with
desnoyers
perceived
in
him
a
nature
like
his
own
more
hard
and
firm
perhaps
but
without
splurges
of
eccentricities
on
this
account
he
had
treated
him
with
such
extraordinary
circumspection
foreseeing
that
a
clash
between
the
two
could
never
be
adjusted
their
only
disagreements
were
about
the
expenses
established
by
madariaga
during
his
regime
since
the
was
managing
the
ranches
the
work
was
costing
less
and
the
people
working
more
diligently
and
that
too
without
yells
and
without
strong
words
and
deeds
with
only
his
presence
and
brief
orders
the
old
man
was
the
only
one
defending
the
capricious
system
of
a
blow
followed
by
a
gift
he
revolted
against
a
minute
and
mechanical
administration
always
the
same
without
any
arbitrary
extravagance
or
tyranny
very
frequently
some
of
the
peons
whom
a
malicious
public
supposed
to
be
closely
related
to
the
ranchman
would
present
themselves
before
desnoyers
with
senor
manager
the
old
patron
say
that
you
are
to
give
me
five
the
senor
manager
would
refuse
and
soon
after
madariaga
would
rush
in
in
a
furious
temper
but
measuring
his
words
nevertheless
remembering
that
his
s
disposition
was
as
serious
as
his
own
i
like
you
very
much
my
son
but
here
no
one
overrules
me
ah
frenchy
you
are
like
all
the
rest
of
your
countrymen
once
you
get
your
claws
on
a
penny
it
goes
into
your
stocking
and
nevermore
sees
the
light
of
day
even
though
they
crucify
you
did
i
say
five
dollars
give
him
ten
i
command
it
and
that
is
the
frenchman
paid
shrugging
his
shoulders
whilst
his
satisfied
with
his
triumph
fled
to
buenos
aires
it
was
a
good
thing
to
have
it
well
understood
that
the
ranch
still
belonged
to
madariaga
the
spaniard
from
one
of
these
trips
he
returned
with
a
companion
a
young
german
who
according
to
him
knew
everything
and
could
do
everything
his
was
working
too
hard
this
karl
hartrott
would
assist
him
in
the
bookkeeping
desnoyers
accepted
the
situation
and
in
a
few
days
felt
increasing
esteem
for
the
new
incumbent
although
they
belonged
to
two
unfriendly
nations
it
didn
t
matter
there
are
good
people
everywhere
and
this
karl
was
a
subordinate
worth
considering
he
kept
his
distance
from
his
equals
and
was
hard
and
inflexible
toward
his
inferiors
all
his
faculties
seemed
concentrated
in
service
and
admiration
for
those
above
him
scarcely
would
madariaga
open
his
lips
before
the
german
s
head
began
nodding
in
agreement
anticipating
his
words
if
he
said
anything
funny
his
clerk
s
laugh
would
break
forth
in
scandalous
roars
with
desnoyers
he
appeared
more
taciturn
working
without
stopping
for
hours
at
a
time
as
soon
as
he
saw
the
manager
entering
the
office
he
would
leap
from
his
seat
holding
himself
erect
with
military
precision
he
was
always
ready
to
do
anything
whatever
unasked
he
spied
on
the
workmen
reporting
their
carelessness
and
mistakes
this
last
service
did
not
especially
please
his
superior
officer
but
he
appreciated
it
as
a
sign
of
interest
in
the
establishment
the
old
man
bragged
triumphantly
of
the
new
acquisition
urging
his
also
to
rejoice
a
very
useful
fellow
isn
t
he
these
gringoes
from
germany
work
well
know
a
good
many
things
and
cost
little
then
too
so
disciplined
so
servile
i
am
sorry
to
praise
him
so
to
you
because
you
are
a
frenchy
and
your
nation
has
in
them
a
very
powerful
enemy
his
people
are
a
desnoyers
replied
with
a
shrug
of
indifference
his
country
was
far
away
and
so
was
germany
who
knew
if
they
would
ever
return
they
were
both
argentinians
now
and
ought
to
interest
themselves
in
present
affairs
and
not
bother
about
the
past
and
how
little
pride
they
have
sneered
madariaga
in
an
ironical
tone
every
one
of
these
gringoes
when
he
is
a
clerk
at
the
capital
sweeps
the
shop
prepares
the
meals
keeps
the
books
sells
to
the
customers
works
the
typewriter
translates
four
or
five
languages
and
dances
attendance
on
the
proprietor
s
lady
friend
as
though
she
were
a
grand
senora
all
for
dollars
a
month
who
can
compete
with
such
people
you
frenchy
you
are
like
me
very
serious
and
would
die
of
hunger
before
passing
through
certain
things
but
mark
my
words
on
this
very
account
they
are
going
to
become
a
terrible
people
after
brief
reflection
the
ranchman
added
perhaps
they
are
not
so
good
as
they
seem
just
see
how
they
treat
those
under
them
it
may
be
that
they
affect
this
simplicity
without
having
it
and
when
they
grin
at
receiving
a
kick
they
are
saying
inside
just
wait
till
my
turn
comes
and
i
ll
give
you
three
then
he
suddenly
seemed
to
repent
of
his
suspicions
at
any
rate
this
karl
is
a
poor
fellow
a
simpleton
who
the
minute
i
say
anything
opens
his
jaws
like
a
he
insists
that
he
comes
of
a
great
family
but
who
knows
anything
about
these
gringoes
all
of
us
dead
with
hunger
when
we
reach
america
claim
to
be
sons
of
madariaga
had
placed
himself
on
a
familiar
footing
with
his
teutonic
treasure
not
through
gratitude
as
with
desnoyers
but
in
order
to
make
him
feel
his
inferiority
he
had
also
introduced
him
on
an
equal
footing
in
his
home
but
only
that
he
might
give
piano
lessons
to
his
younger
daughter
the
romantica
was
no
longer
framing
herself
in
the
doorway
in
the
gloaming
watching
the
sunset
reflections
when
karl
had
finished
his
work
in
the
office
he
was
now
coming
to
the
house
and
seating
himself
beside
elena
who
was
tinkling
away
with
a
persistence
worthy
of
a
better
fate
at
the
end
of
the
hour
the
german
accompanying
himself
on
the
piano
would
sing
fragments
from
wagner
in
such
a
way
that
it
put
madariaga
to
sleep
in
his
armchair
with
his
great
paraguay
cigar
sticking
out
of
his
mouth
elena
meanwhile
was
contemplating
with
increasing
interest
the
singing
gringo
he
was
not
the
knight
of
her
dreams
awaited
by
the
fair
lady
he
was
almost
a
servant
a
blond
immigrant
with
reddish
hair
fat
heavy
and
with
bovine
eyes
that
reflected
an
eternal
fear
of
disagreeing
with
his
chiefs
but
day
by
day
she
was
finding
in
him
something
which
rather
modified
these
impressions
his
feminine
fairness
except
where
he
was
burned
by
the
sun
the
increasingly
martial
aspect
of
his
moustachios
the
agility
with
which
he
mounted
his
horse
his
air
of
a
troubadour
intoning
with
a
rather
weak
tenor
voluptuous
romances
whose
words
she
did
not
understand
one
night
just
before
supper
the
impressionable
girl
announced
with
a
feverish
excitement
which
she
could
no
longer
repress
that
she
had
made
a
grand
discovery
papa
karl
is
of
noble
birth
he
belongs
to
a
great
the
plainsman
made
a
gesture
of
indifference
other
things
were
vexing
him
in
those
days
but
during
the
evening
feeling
the
necessity
of
venting
on
somebody
the
wrath
which
had
been
gnawing
at
his
vitals
since
his
last
trip
to
buenos
aires
he
interrupted
the
singer
see
here
gringo
what
is
all
this
nonsense
about
nobility
which
you
have
been
telling
my
girl
karl
left
the
piano
that
he
might
draw
himself
up
to
the
approved
military
position
before
responding
under
the
influence
of
his
recent
song
his
pose
suggested
lohengrin
about
to
reveal
the
secret
of
his
life
his
father
had
been
general
von
hartrott
one
of
the
commanders
in
the
war
of
the
emperor
had
rewarded
his
services
by
giving
him
a
title
one
of
his
uncles
was
an
intimate
councillor
of
the
king
of
prussia
his
older
brothers
were
conspicuous
in
the
most
select
regiments
he
had
carried
a
sword
as
a
lieutenant
bored
with
all
this
grandeur
madariaga
interrupted
him
lies
nonsense
hot
air
the
very
idea
of
a
gringo
talking
to
him
about
nobility
he
had
left
europe
when
very
young
in
order
to
cast
in
his
lot
with
the
revolting
democracies
of
america
and
although
nobility
now
seemed
to
him
something
and
incomprehensible
still
he
stoutly
maintained
that
the
only
true
nobility
was
that
of
his
own
country
he
would
yield
first
place
to
the
gringoes
for
the
invention
of
machinery
and
ships
and
for
breeding
priceless
animals
but
all
the
counts
and
marquises
of
appeared
to
him
to
be
fictitious
characters
all
tomfoolery
he
blustered
there
isn
t
any
nobility
in
your
country
nor
have
you
five
dollars
all
told
to
rub
against
each
other
if
you
had
you
wouldn
t
come
over
here
to
play
the
gallant
to
women
who
are
you
know
what
they
are
as
well
as
i
to
the
astonishment
of
desnoyers
the
german
received
this
onslaught
with
much
humility
nodding
his
head
in
agreement
with
the
patron
s
last
words
if
there
s
any
truth
in
all
this
twaddle
about
titles
continued
madariaga
implacably
swords
and
uniforms
what
did
you
come
here
for
what
in
the
devil
did
you
do
in
your
own
country
that
you
had
to
leave
it
now
karl
hung
his
head
confused
and
stuttering
papa
papa
pleaded
elena
the
poor
little
fellow
how
can
you
humiliate
him
so
just
because
he
is
poor
and
she
felt
a
deep
gratitude
toward
her
when
he
broke
through
his
usual
reserve
in
order
to
come
to
the
rescue
of
the
german
oh
yes
of
course
he
s
a
fellow
said
madariaga
excusing
himself
but
he
comes
from
a
land
that
i
when
desnoyers
made
a
trip
to
buenos
aires
a
few
days
afterward
the
cause
of
the
old
man
s
wrath
was
explained
it
appeared
that
for
some
months
past
madariaga
had
been
the
financial
guarantor
and
devoted
swain
of
a
german
prima
donna
stranded
in
south
america
with
an
italian
opera
company
it
was
she
who
had
recommended
karl
an
unfortunate
countryman
who
after
wandering
through
many
parts
of
the
continent
was
now
living
with
her
as
a
sort
of
gentlemanly
singer
madariaga
had
joyously
expended
upon
this
courtesan
many
thousands
of
dollars
a
childish
enthusiasm
had
accompanied
him
in
this
novel
existence
midst
urban
dissipations
until
he
happened
to
discover
that
his
fraulein
was
leading
another
life
during
his
absence
laughing
at
him
with
the
parasites
of
her
retinue
whereupon
he
arose
in
his
wrath
and
bade
her
farewell
to
the
accompaniment
of
blows
and
broken
furniture
the
last
adventure
of
his
life
desnoyers
suspected
his
abdication
upon
hearing
him
admit
his
age
for
the
first
time
he
did
not
intend
to
return
to
the
capital
it
was
all
false
glitter
existence
in
the
country
surrounded
by
all
his
family
and
doing
good
to
the
poor
was
the
only
sure
thing
and
the
terrible
centaur
expressed
himself
with
the
idyllic
tenderness
and
firm
virtue
of
years
already
insensible
to
temptation
after
his
scene
with
karl
he
had
increased
the
german
s
salary
trying
as
usual
to
counteract
the
effects
of
his
violent
outbreaks
with
generosity
that
which
he
could
not
forget
was
his
dependent
s
nobility
constantly
making
it
the
subject
of
new
jests
that
glorious
boast
had
brought
to
his
mind
the
genealogical
trees
of
the
illustrious
ancestry
of
his
prize
cattle
the
german
was
a
pedigreed
fellow
and
thenceforth
he
called
him
by
that
nickname
seated
on
summer
nights
under
the
awning
he
surveyed
his
family
around
him
with
a
sort
of
patriarchal
ecstasy
in
the
evening
hush
could
be
heard
the
buzzing
of
insects
and
the
croaking
of
the
frogs
from
the
distant
ranches
floated
the
songs
of
the
peons
as
they
prepared
their
suppers
it
was
harvest
time
and
great
bands
of
immigrants
were
encamped
in
the
fields
for
the
extra
work
madariaga
had
known
many
of
the
hard
old
days
of
wars
and
violence
upon
his
arrival
in
south
america
he
had
witnessed
the
last
years
of
the
tyranny
of
rosas
he
loved
to
enumerate
the
different
provincial
and
national
revolutions
in
which
he
had
taken
part
but
all
this
had
disappeared
and
would
never
return
these
were
the
times
of
peace
work
and
abundance
just
think
of
it
frenchy
he
said
driving
away
the
mosquitoes
with
the
puffs
of
his
cigar
i
am
spanish
you
french
karl
german
my
daughters
argentinians
the
cook
russian
his
assistant
greek
the
stable
boy
english
the
kitchen
servants
chinas
natives
galicians
or
italians
and
among
the
peons
there
are
many
castes
and
laws
and
yet
we
all
live
in
peace
in
europe
we
would
have
probably
been
in
a
grand
fight
by
this
time
but
here
we
are
all
he
took
much
pleasure
in
listening
to
the
music
of
the
laborers
laments
from
italian
songs
to
the
accompaniment
of
the
accordion
spanish
guitars
and
creole
choruses
wild
voices
chanting
of
love
and
death
this
is
a
regular
noah
s
ark
exulted
the
vainglorious
patriarch
he
means
the
tower
of
babel
thought
desnoyers
to
himself
but
it
s
all
the
same
thing
to
the
old
i
believe
he
rambled
on
that
we
live
thus
because
in
this
part
of
the
world
there
are
no
kings
and
a
very
small
army
and
mankind
is
thinking
only
of
enjoying
itself
as
much
as
possible
thanks
to
its
work
but
i
also
believe
that
we
live
so
peacefully
because
there
is
such
abundance
that
everyone
gets
his
share
how
quickly
we
would
spring
to
arms
if
the
rations
were
less
than
the
people
again
he
fell
into
reflective
silence
shortly
after
announcing
the
result
of
his
meditations
be
that
as
it
may
be
we
must
recognize
that
here
life
is
more
tranquil
than
in
the
other
world
men
are
taken
for
what
they
are
worth
and
mingle
together
without
thinking
whether
they
came
from
one
country
or
another
over
here
fellows
do
not
come
in
droves
to
kill
other
fellows
whom
they
do
not
know
and
whose
only
crime
is
that
they
were
born
in
an
unfriendly
country
man
is
a
bad
beast
everywhere
i
know
that
but
here
he

goodness
of

there
are
too
many
they

in
heaps
getting
in

frenchy

the

can
live
comfortably
and
runs
no

of
being
killed
for
things
he
doesn

understand
there
is

and
as
though
an
echo
of
the
rustic
s
reflections
karl
seated
at
the
piano
began
chanting
in
a
low
voice
one
of
beethoven
s
hymns
we
sing
the
joy
of
life
we
sing
of
liberty
we
ll
ne
er
betray
our
though
great
the
guerdon

a
few
days
afterward
desnoyers
recalled
bitterly
the
old
man
s
illusion
for
war
domestic
war
broke
loose
in
this
idyllic
of
ranch
life
run
senor
manager
the
old
patron
has
unsheathed
his
knife
and
is
going
to
kill
the
german
and
desnoyers
had
hurried
from
his
office
warned
by
the
peon
s
summons
madariaga
was
chasing
karl
knife
in
hand
stumbling
over
everything
that
blocked
his
way
only
his
dared
to
stop
him
and
disarm
him
that
shameless
pedigreed
fellow
bellowed
the
livid
old
man
as
he
writhed
in
desnoyers
firm
clutch
half
famished
all
he
thinks
he
has
to
do
is
to
come
to
my
house
and
take
away
my
daughters
and
dollars
let
me
go
i
tell
you
let
me
loose
that
i
may
kill
and
in
order
to
free
himself
from
desnoyers
he
tried
further
to
explain
the
difficulty
he
had
accepted
the
frenchman
as
a
husband
for
his
daughter
because
he
was
to
his
liking
modest
honest
and
serious
but
this
singing
pedigreed
fellow
with
all
his
airs
he
was
a
man
that
he
had
gotten
from
well
he
didn
t
wish
to
say
just
where
and
the
frenchman
though
knowing
perfectly
well
what
his
introduction
to
karl
had
been
pretended
not
to
understand
him
as
the
german
had
by
this
time
made
good
his
escape
the
ranchman
consented
to
being
pushed
toward
his
house
talking
all
the
time
about
giving
a
beating
to
the
romantica
and
another
to
the
china
for
not
having
informed
him
of
the
courtship
he
had
surprised
his
daughter
and
the
gringo
holding
hands
and
exchanging
kisses
in
a
grove
near
the
house
he
s
after
my
dollars
howled
the
irate
father
he
wants
america
to
enrich
him
quickly
at
the
expense
of
the
old
spaniard
and
that
is
the
reason
for
so
much
truckling
so
much
and
so
much
nobility
imposter
musician
and
he
repeated
the
word
musician
with
contempt
as
though
it
were
the
sum
and
substance
of
everything
vile
very
firmly
and
with
few
words
desnoyers
brought
the
wrangling
to
an
end
while
her
protected
her
retreat
the
romantica
clinging
to
her
mother
had
taken
refuge
in
the
top
of
the
house
sobbing
and
moaning
oh
the
poor
little
fellow
everybody
against
him
her
sister
meanwhile
was
exerting
all
the
powers
of
a
discreet
daughter
with
the
rampageous
old
man
in
the
office
and
desnoyers
had
gone
in
search
of
karl
finding
that
he
had
not
yet
recovered
from
the
shock
of
his
terrible
surprise
he
gave
him
a
horse
advising
him
to
betake
himself
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
nearest
railway
station
although
the
german
was
soon
far
from
the
ranch
he
did
not
long
remain
alone
in
a
few
days
the
romantica
followed
him
iseult
of
the
white
hands
went
in
search
of
tristan
the
knight
this
event
did
not
cause
madariaga
s
desperation
to
break
out
as
violently
as
his
had
expected
for
the
first
time
he
saw
him
weep
his
gay
and
robust
old
age
had
suddenly
fallen
from
him
the
news
having
clapped
ten
years
on
to
his
four
score
like
a
child
whimpering
and
tremulous
he
threw
his
arms
around
desnoyers
moistening
his
neck
with
tears
he
has
taken
her
away
that
son
of
a
great
flea
has
taken
her
away
this
time
he
did
not
lay
all
the
blame
on
his
china
he
wept
with
her
and
as
if
trying
to
console
her
by
a
public
confession
kept
saying
over
and
over
it
is
my
fault
it
has
all
been
because
of
my
very
very
great
now
began
for
desnoyers
a
period
of
difficulties
and
conflicts
the
fugitives
on
one
of
his
visits
to
the
capital
threw
themselves
on
his
mercy
imploring
his
protection
the
romantica
wept
declaring
that
only
her
the
most
knightly
man
in
the
world
could
save
her
karl
gazed
at
him
like
a
faithful
hound
trusting
in
his
master
these
trying
interviews
were
repeated
on
all
his
trips
then
on
returning
to
the
ranch
he
would
find
the
old
man
moody
looking
fixedly
ahead
of
him
as
though
seeing
invisible
power
and
wailing
it
is
my
punishment
the
punishment
for
my
the
memory
of
the
discreditable
circumstances
under
which
he
had
made
karl
s
acquaintance
before
bringing
him
into
his
home
tormented
the
old
centaur
with
remorse
some
afternoons
he
would
have
a
horse
saddled
going
full
gallop
toward
the
neighboring
village
but
he
was
no
longer
hunting
hospitable
ranches
he
needed
to
pass
some
time
in
the
church
speaking
alone
with
the
images
that
were
there
only
for
him
since
he
had
footed
the
bills
for
them
through
my
sin
through
my
very
great
sin
but
in
spite
of
his
desnoyers
had
to
work
very
hard
to
get
any
kind
of
a
settlement
out
of
the
old
penitent
whenever
he
suggested
legalizing
the
situation
and
making
the
necessary
arrangements
for
their
marriage
the
old
tyrant
would
not
let
him
go
on
do
what
you
think
best
but
don
t
say
anything
to
me
about
several
months
passed
by
one
day
the
frenchman
approached
him
with
a
certain
air
of
mystery
elena
has
a
son
and
has
named
him
julio
after
and
you
you
great
useless
hulk
stormed
the
ranchman
and
that
weak
cow
of
a
wife
of
yours
you
dare
to
live
tranquilly
on
without
giving
me
a
grandson
ah
frenchy
that
is
why
the
germans
will
finally
overwhelm
you
you
see
it
right
here
that
bandit
has
a
son
while
you
after
four
years
of
marriage
nothing
i
want
a
grandson
do
you
understand
that
and
in
order
to
console
himself
for
this
lack
of
little
ones
around
his
own
hearth
he
betook
himself
to
the
ranch
of
his
overseer
celedonio
where
a
band
of
little
gathered
tremblingly
and
hopefully
about
him
suddenly
china
died
the
poor
misia
petrona
passed
away
as
discreetly
as
she
had
lived
trying
even
in
her
last
hours
to
avoid
all
annoyance
for
her
husband
asking
his
pardon
with
an
imploring
look
for
any
trouble
which
her
death
might
cause
him
elena
came
to
the
ranch
in
order
to
see
her
mother
s
body
for
the
last
time
and
desnoyers
who
for
more
than
a
year
had
been
supporting
them
behind
his
s
back
took
advantage
of
this
occasion
to
overcome
the
old
man
s
resentment
well
i
ll
forgive
her
said
the
ranchman
finally
i
ll
do
it
for
the
sake
of
my
poor
wife
and
for
you
she
may
remain
on
the
ranch
and
that
shameless
gringo
may
come
with
but
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
him
the
german
was
to
be
an
employee
under
desnoyers
and
they
could
live
in
the
office
building
as
though
they
did
not
belong
to
the
family
he
would
never
say
a
word
to
karl
but
scarcely
had
the
german
returned
before
he
began
giving
him
orders
rudely
as
though
he
were
a
perfect
stranger
at
other
times
he
would
pass
by
him
as
though
he
did
not
know
him
upon
finding
elena
in
the
house
with
his
older
daughter
he
would
go
on
without
speaking
to
her
in
vain
his
romantica
transfigured
by
maternity
improved
all
opportunities
for
putting
her
child
in
his
way
calling
him
loudly
by
name
julio
julio
they
want
that
brat
of
a
singing
gringo
that
carrot
top
with
a
face
like
a
skinned
kid
to
be
my
grandson
i
prefer
celedonio
and
by
way
of
emphasizing
his
protest
he
entered
the
dwelling
of
his
overseer
scattering
among
his
dusky
brood
handfuls
of
dollars
after
seven
years
of
marriage
the
wife
of
desnoyers
found
that
she
too
was
going
to
become
a
mother
her
sister
already
had
three
sons
but
what
were
they
worth
to
madariaga
compared
to
the
grandson
that
was
going
to
come
it
will
be
a
boy
he
announced
positively
because
i
need
one
so
it
shall
be
named
julio
and
i
hope
that
it
will
look
like
my
poor
dead
since
the
death
of
his
wife
he
no
longer
called
her
the
china
feeling
something
of
a
posthumous
love
for
the
poor
woman
who
in
her
lifetime
had
endured
so
much
so
timidly
and
silently
now
my
poor
dead
wife
cropped
out
every
other
instant
in
the
conversation
of
the
remorseful
ranchman
his
desires
were
fulfilled
luisa
gave
birth
to
a
boy
who
bore
the
name
of
julio
and
although
he
did
not
show
in
his
somewhat
sketchy
features
any
striking
resemblance
to
his
grandmother
still
he
had
the
black
hair
and
eyes
and
olive
skin
of
a
brunette
welcome
this
was
a
grandson
in
the
generosity
of
his
joy
he
even
permitted
the
german
to
enter
the
house
for
the
baptismal
ceremony
when
julio
desnoyers
was
two
years
old
his
grandfather
made
the
rounds
of
his
estates
holding
him
on
the
saddle
in
front
of
him
he
went
from
ranch
to
ranch
in
order
to
show
him
to
the
populace
like
an
ancient
monarch
presenting
his
heir
later
on
when
the
child
was
able
to
say
a
few
words
he
entertained
himself
for
hours
at
a
time
talking
with
the
tot
under
the
shade
of
the
eucalyptus
tree
a
certain
mental
failing
was
beginning
to
be
noticed
in
the
old
man
although
not
exactly
in
his
dotage
his
aggressiveness
was
becoming
very
childish
even
in
his
most
affectionate
moments
he
used
to
contradict
everybody
and
hunt
up
ways
of
annoying
his
relatives
come
here
you
false
prophet
he
would
say
to
julio
you
are
a
the
grandchild
protested
as
though
he
had
been
insulted
his
mother
had
taught
him
that
he
was
an
argentinian
and
his
father
had
suggested
that
she
also
add
spanish
in
order
to
please
the
grandfather
very
well
then
if
you
are
not
a
frenchy
shout
down
with
napoleon
and
he
looked
around
him
to
see
if
desnoyers
might
be
near
believing
that
this
would
displease
him
greatly
but
his
pursued
the
even
tenor
of
his
way
shrugging
his
shoulders
down
with
napoleon
repeated
julio
and
he
instantly
held
out
his
hand
while
his
grandfather
went
through
his
pockets
karl
s
sons
now
four
in
number
used
to
circle
around
their
grandparent
like
a
humble
chorus
kept
at
a
distance
and
stare
enviously
at
these
gifts
in
order
to
win
his
favor
they
one
day
when
they
saw
him
alone
came
boldly
up
to
him
shouting
in
unison
down
with
napoleon
you
insolent
gringoes
ranted
the
old
man
that
s
what
that
shameless
father
has
taught
you
if
you
say
that
again
i
ll
chase
you
with
a
the
very
idea
of
insulting
a
great
man
in
that
way
while
he
tolerated
this
blond
brood
he
never
would
permit
the
slightest
intimacy
desnoyers
and
his
wife
often
had
to
come
to
their
rescue
accusing
the
grandfather
of
injustice
and
in
order
to
pour
the
vials
of
his
wrath
out
on
someone
the
old
plainsman
would
hunt
up
celedonio
the
best
of
his
listeners
who
invariably
replied
yes
patron
that
s
so
they
re
not
to
blame
agreed
the
old
man
but
i
can
t
abide
them
besides
they
are
so
like
their
father
so
fair
with
hair
like
a
shredded
carrot
and
the
two
oldest
wearing
specs
as
if
they
were
court
clerks
they
don
t
seem
like
folks
with
those
glasses
they
look
like
madariaga
had
never
seen
any
sharks
but
he
imagined
them
without
knowing
why
with
round
glassy
eyes
like
the
bottoms
of
bottles
by
the
time
he
was
eight
years
old
julio
was
a
famous
little
equestrian
to
horse
peoncito
his
grandfather
would
cry
and
away
they
would
race
streaking
like
lightning
across
the
fields
midst
thousands
and
thousands
of
horned
herds
the
peoncito
proud
of
his
title
obeyed
the
master
in
everything
and
so
learned
to
whirl
the
lasso
over
the
steers
leaving
them
bound
and
conquered
upon
making
his
pony
take
a
deep
ditch
or
creep
along
the
edge
of
the
cliffs
he
sometimes
fell
under
his
mount
but
clambered
up
gamely
ah
fine
cowboy
exclaimed
the
grandfather
bursting
with
pride
in
his
exploits
here
are
five
dollars
for
you
to
give
a
handkerchief
to
some
the
old
man
in
his
increasing
mental
confusion
did
not
gauge
his
gifts
exactly
with
the
lad
s
years
and
the
infantile
horseman
while
keeping
the
money
was
wondering
what
china
was
referred
to
and
why
he
should
make
her
a
present
desnoyers
finally
had
to
drag
his
son
away
from
the
baleful
teachings
of
his
grandfather
it
was
simply
useless
to
have
masters
come
to
the
house
or
to
send
julio
to
the
country
school
madariaga
would
always
steal
his
grandson
away
and
then
they
would
scour
the
plains
together
so
when
the
boy
was
eleven
years
old
his
father
placed
him
in
a
big
school
in
the
capital
the
grandfather
then
turned
his
attention
to
julio
s
sister
exhibiting
her
before
him
as
he
had
her
brother
as
he
took
her
from
ranch
to
ranch
everybody
called
chicha
s
little
girl
chichi
but
the
grandfather
bestowed
on
her
the
same
nickname
that
he
had
given
her
brother
the
and
chichi
who
was
growing
up
wild
vigorous
and
wilful
breakfasting
on
meat
and
talking
in
her
sleep
of
roast
beef
readily
fell
in
with
the
old
man
s
tastes
she
was
dressed
like
a
boy
rode
astride
like
a
man
and
in
order
to
win
her
grandfather
s
praises
as
fine
cowboy
carried
a
knife
in
the
back
of
her
belt
the
two
raced
the
fields
from
sun
to
sun
madariaga
following
the
flying
pigtail
of
the
little
amazon
as
though
it
were
a
flag
when
nine
years
old
she
too
could
lasso
the
cattle
with
much
dexterity
what
most
irritated
the
ranchman
was
that
his
family
would
remember
his
age
he
received
as
insults
his
s
counsels
to
remain
quietly
at
home
becoming
more
aggressive
and
reckless
as
he
advanced
in
years
exaggerating
his
activity
as
if
he
wished
to
drive
death
away
he
accepted
no
help
except
from
his
when
karl
s
children
great
hulking
youngsters
hastened
to
his
assistance
and
offered
to
hold
his
stirrup
he
would
repel
them
with
snorts
of
indignation
so
you
think
i
am
no
longer
able
to
help
myself
eh
there
s
still
enough
life
in
me
to
make
those
who
are
waiting
for
me
to
die
so
as
to
grab
my
dollars
chew
their
disappointment
a
long
while
yet
since
the
german
and
his
wife
were
kept
pointedly
apart
from
the
family
life
they
had
to
put
up
with
these
allusions
in
silence
karl
needing
protection
constantly
shadowed
the
frenchman
improving
every
opportunity
to
overwhelm
him
with
his
eulogies
he
never
could
thank
him
enough
for
all
that
he
had
done
for
him
he
was
his
only
champion
he
longed
for
a
chance
to
prove
his
gratitude
to
die
for
him
if
necessary
his
wife
admired
him
with
enthusiasm
as
the
most
gifted
knight
in
the
and
desnoyers
received
their
devotion
in
gratified
silence
accepting
the
german
as
an
excellent
comrade
as
he
controlled
absolutely
the
family
fortune
he
aided
karl
very
generously
without
arousing
the
resentment
of
the
old
man
he
also
took
the
initiative
in
bringing
about
the
realization
of
karl
s
pet
ambition
a
visit
to
the
fatherland
so
many
years
in
america
for
the
very
reason
that
desnoyers
himself
had
no
desire
to
return
to
europe
he
wished
to
facilitate
karl
s
trip
and
gave
him
the
means
to
make
the
journey
with
his
entire
family
the
had
no
curiosity
as
to
who
paid
the
expenses
let
them
go
he
said
gleefully
and
may
they
never
return
their
absence
was
not
a
very
long
one
for
they
spent
their
year
s
allowance
in
three
months
karl
who
had
apprised
his
parents
of
the
great
fortune
which
his
marriage
had
brought
him
wished
to
make
an
impression
as
a
millionaire
in
full
enjoyment
of
his
riches
elena
returned
radiant
speaking
with
pride
of
her
relatives
of
the
baron
colonel
of
hussars
of
the
captain
of
the
guard
of
the
councillor
at
court
asserting
that
all
countries
were
most
insignificant
when
compared
with
her
husband
s
she
even
affected
a
certain
condescension
toward
desnoyers
praising
him
as
a
very
worthy
man
but
without
ancient
lineage
or
distinguished
family
and
french
karl
on
the
other
hand
showed
the
same
devotion
as
before
keeping
himself
submissively
in
the
background
when
with
his
who
had
the
keys
of
the
cash
box
and
was
his
only
defense
against
the
browbeating
old
patron
he
had
left
his
two
older
sons
in
a
school
in
germany
years
afterwards
they
reached
an
equal
footing
with
the
other
grandchildren
of
the
spaniard
who
always
begrudged
them
their
existence
perfect
frights
with
carroty
hair
and
eyes
like
a
suddenly
the
old
man
became
very
lonely
for
they
had
also
carried
off
his
second
the
good
chicha
could
not
tolerate
her
daughter
s
growing
up
like
a
boy
parading
round
on
horseback
all
the
time
and
glibly
repeating
her
grandfather
s
vulgarities
so
she
was
now
in
a
convent
in
the
capital
where
the
sisters
had
to
battle
valiantly
in
order
to
tame
the
mischievous
rebellion
of
their
wild
little
pupil
when
julio
and
chichi
returned
to
the
ranch
for
their
vacations
the
grandfather
again
concentrated
his
fondness
on
the
first
as
though
the
girl
had
merely
been
a
substitute
desnoyers
was
becoming
indignant
at
his
son
s
dissipated
life
he
was
no
longer
at
college
and
his
existence
was
that
of
a
student
in
a
rich
family
who
makes
up
for
parental
parsimony
with
all
sorts
of
imprudent
borrowings
but
madariaga
came
to
the
defense
of
his
grandson
ah
the
fine
cowboy
seeing
him
again
on
the
ranch
he
admired
the
dash
of
the
good
looking
youth
testing
his
muscles
in
order
to
convince
himself
of
their
strength
and
making
him
to
recount
his
nightly
escapades
as
ringleader
of
a
band
of
toughs
in
the
capital
he
longed
to
go
to
buenos
aires
himself
just
to
see
the
youngster
in
the
midst
of
this
gay
wild
life
but
alas
he
was
not
seventeen
like
his
grandson
he
had
already
passed
eighty
come
here
you
false
prophet
tell
me
how
many
children
you
have
you
must
have
a
great
many
children
you
know
father
protested
chicha
who
was
always
hanging
around
fearing
her
parent
s
bad
teachings
stop
nagging
at
me
yelled
the
irate
old
fellow
in
a
towering
temper
i
know
what
i
m
paternity
figured
largely
in
all
his
amorous
fancies
he
was
almost
blind
and
the
loss
of
his
sight
was
accompanied
by
an
increasing
mental
upset
his
crazy
senility
took
on
a
lewd
character
expressing
itself
in
language
which
scandalized
or
amused
the
community
oh
you
rascal
what
a
pretty
fellow
you
are
he
said
leering
at
julio
with
eyes
which
could
no
longer
distinguish
things
except
in
a
shadowy
way
you
are
the
living
image
of
my
poor
dead
wife
have
a
good
time
for
grandpa
is
always
here
with
his
money
if
you
could
only
count
on
what
your
father
gives
you
you
would
live
like
a
hermit
these
frenchies
are
a
lot
but
i
am
looking
out
for
you
peoncito
spend
and
enjoy
yourself
that
s
what
your
granddaddy
has
piled
up
the
silver
for
when
the
desnoyers
children
returned
to
the
capital
he
spent
his
lonesome
hours
in
going
from
ranch
to
ranch
a
young
would
set
the
water
for
his
to
boiling
on
the
hearth
and
the
old
man
would
wonder
confusedly
if
she
were
his
daughter
another
fifteen
years
old
would
offer
him
a
gourd
filled
with
the
bitter
liquid
and
a
silver
pipe
with
which
to
sip
it
a
grandchild
perhaps
he
wasn
t
sure
and
so
he
passed
the
afternoons
silent
and
sluggish
drinking
gourd
after
gourd
of
shrub
tea
surrounded
by
families
who
stared
at
him
with
admiration
and
fear
every
time
he
mounted
his
horse
for
these
excursions
his
older
daughter
would
protest
at
years
would
it
not
be
better
for
him
to
remain
quietly
at
home
some
day
something
terrible
would
happen
and
the
terrible
thing
did
happen
one
evening
the
patron
s
horse
came
slowly
home
without
its
rider
the
old
man
had
fallen
on
the
sloping
highway
and
when
they
found
him
he
was
dead
thus
died
the
centaur
as
he
had
lived
with
the
lash
hanging
from
his
wrist
with
his
legs
bowed
by
the
saddle
a
spanish
notary
almost
as
old
as
he
produced
the
will
the
family
was
somewhat
alarmed
at
seeing
what
a
voluminous
document
it
was
what
terrible
bequests
had
madariaga
dictated
the
reading
of
the
first
part
tranquilized
karl
and
elena
the
old
father
had
left
considerable
more
to
the
wife
of
desnoyers
but
there
still
remained
an
enormous
share
for
the
romantica
and
her
children
i
do
this
he
said
in
memory
of
my
poor
dead
wife
and
so
that
people
won
t
after
this
came
legacies
individuals
women
and
men
who
had
lived
on
the
ranch
for
many
years
as
tenants
and
retainers
were
to
receive
the
last
paternal
munificence
of
the
old
patriarch
at
the
head
of
these
was
celedonio
whom
madariaga
had
greatly
enriched
in
his
lifetime
for
no
heavier
work
than
listening
to
him
and
repeating
that
s
so
patron
that
s
true
more
than
a
million
dollars
were
represented
by
these
bequests
in
lands
and
herds
the
one
who
completed
the
list
of
beneficiaries
was
julio
desnoyers
the
grandfather
had
made
special
mention
of
this
namesake
leaving
him
a
plantation
to
meet
his
private
expenses
making
up
for
that
which
his
father
would
not
give
but
that
represents
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dollars
protested
karl
who
had
been
making
himself
almost
obnoxious
in
his
efforts
to
assure
himself
that
his
wife
had
not
been
overlooked
in
the
will
the
days
following
the
reading
of
this
will
were
very
trying
ones
for
the
family
elena
and
her
children
kept
looking
at
the
other
group
as
though
they
had
just
waked
up
contemplating
them
in
an
entirely
new
light
they
seemed
to
forget
what
they
were
going
to
receive
in
their
envy
of
the
much
larger
share
of
their
relatives
desnoyers
benevolent
and
conciliatory
had
a
plan
an
expert
in
administrative
affairs
he
realized
that
the
distribution
among
the
heirs
was
going
to
double
the
expenses
without
increasing
the
income
he
was
calculating
besides
the
complications
and
disbursements
necessary
for
a
judicial
division
of
nine
immense
ranches
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cattle
deposits
in
the
banks
houses
in
the
city
and
debts
to
collect
would
it
not
be
better
for
them
all
to
continue
living
as
before
had
they
not
lived
most
peaceably
as
a
united
family
the
german
received
this
suggestion
by
drawing
himself
up
haughtily
no
to
each
one
should
be
given
what
was
his
let
each
live
in
his
own
sphere
he
wished
to
establish
himself
in
europe
spending
his
wealth
freely
there
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
return
to
his
as
they
looked
squarely
at
each
other
desnoyers
saw
an
unknown
karl
a
karl
whose
existence
he
had
never
suspected
when
he
was
under
his
protection
timid
and
servile
the
frenchman
too
was
beginning
to
see
things
in
a
new
light
very
well
he
assented
let
each
take
his
own
that
seems
fair
to
chapter
iii
the
desnoyers
family
the
madariagan
succession
as
it
was
called
in
the
language
of
the
legal
men
interested
in
prolonging
it
in
order
to
augment
their
fees
was
divided
into
two
groups
separated
by
the
ocean
the
desnoyers
moved
to
buenos
aires
the
hartrotts
moved
to
berlin
as
soon
as
karl
could
sell
all
the
legacy
to
it
in
lands
and
industrial
enterprises
in
his
own
country
desnoyers
no
longer
cared
to
live
in
the
country
for
twenty
years
now
he
had
been
the
head
of
an
enormous
agricultural
and
stock
raising
business
overseeing
hundreds
of
men
in
the
various
ranches
the
parcelling
out
of
the
old
man
s
fortune
among
elena
and
the
other
legatees
had
considerably
constricted
the
radius
of
his
authority
and
it
angered
him
to
see
established
on
the
neighboring
lands
so
many
foreigners
almost
all
germans
who
had
bought
of
karl
furthermore
he
was
getting
old
his
wife
s
inheritance
amounted
to
about
twenty
millions
of
dollars
and
perhaps
his
was
showing
the
better
judgment
in
returning
to
europe
so
he
leased
some
of
the
plantations
handed
over
the
superintendence
of
others
to
those
mentioned
in
the
will
who
considered
themselves
members
of
the
family
of
which
desnoyers
as
the
patron
received
their
submissive
allegiance
and
moved
to
buenos
aires
by
this
move
he
was
able
to
keep
an
eye
on
his
son
who
continued
living
a
dissipated
life
without
making
any
headway
in
his
engineering
studies
then
too
chichi
was
now
almost
a
woman
her
robust
development
making
her
look
older
than
she
was
and
it
was
not
expedient
to
keep
her
on
the
estate
to
become
a
rustic
senorita
like
her
mother
dona
luisa
had
also
tired
of
ranch
life
the
social
triumphs
of
her
sister
making
her
a
little
restless
she
was
incapable
of
feeling
jealous
but
material
ambitions
made
her
anxious
that
her
children
should
not
bring
up
the
rear
of
the
procession
in
which
the
other
grandchildren
were
cutting
such
a
dashing
figure
during
the
year
most
wonderful
reports
from
germany
were
finding
their
way
to
the
desnoyers
home
in
the
capital
the
aunt
from
berlin
as
the
children
called
her
kept
sending
long
letters
filled
with
accounts
of
dances
dinners
hunting
parties
and
titles
many
and
military
titles
our
brother
the
colonel
our
cousin
the
baron
our
uncle
the
intimate
councillor
our
the
truly
all
the
extravagances
of
the
german
social
ladder
which
incessantly
manufactures
new
titles
in
order
to
satisfy
the
thirst
for
honors
of
a
people
divided
into
castes
were
enumerated
with
delight
by
the
old
romantica
she
even
mentioned
her
husband
s
secretary
a
nobody
who
through
working
in
the
public
offices
had
acquired
the
title
of
rechnungarath
councillor
of
calculations
she
also
referred
with
much
pride
to
the
retired
oberpedell
which
she
had
in
her
house
explaining
that
that
meant
superior
the
news
about
her
children
was
no
less
glorious
the
oldest
was
the
wise
one
of
the
family
he
was
devoted
to
philology
and
the
historical
sciences
but
his
sight
was
growing
weaker
all
the
time
because
of
his
omnivorous
reading
soon
he
would
be
a
doctor
and
before
he
was
thirty
a
herr
professor
the
mother
lamented
that
he
had
not
military
aspirations
considering
that
his
tastes
had
somewhat
distorted
the
lofty
destinies
of
the
family
professorships
sciences
and
literature
were
more
properly
the
perquisites
of
the
jews
unable
because
of
their
race
to
obtain
preferment
in
the
army
but
she
was
trying
to
console
herself
by
keeping
in
mind
that
a
celebrated
professor
could
in
time
acquire
a
social
rank
almost
equal
to
that
of
a
colonel
her
other
four
sons
would
become
officers
their
father
was
preparing
the
ground
so
that
they
might
enter
the
guard
or
some
aristocratic
regiment
without
any
of
the
members
being
able
to
vote
against
their
admission
the
two
daughters
would
surely
marry
when
they
had
reached
a
suitable
age
with
officers
of
the
hussars
whose
names
bore
the
magic
von
of
petty
nobility
haughty
and
charming
gentlemen
about
whom
the
daughter
of
misia
petrona
waxed
most
enthusiastic
the
establishment
of
the
hartrotts
was
in
keeping
with
these
new
relationships
in
the
home
in
berlin
the
servants
wore
and
white
wigs
on
the
nights
of
great
banquets
karl
had
bought
an
old
castle
with
pointed
towers
ghosts
in
the
cellars
and
various
legends
of
assassinations
assaults
and
abductions
which
enlivened
its
history
in
an
interesting
way
an
architect
decorated
with
many
foreign
orders
and
bearing
the
title
of
councillor
of
construction
was
engaged
to
modernize
the
mediaeval
edifice
without
sacrificing
its
terrifying
aspect
the
romantica
described
in
anticipation
the
receptions
in
the
gloomy
salon
the
light
diffused
by
electricity
simulating
torches
the
crackling
of
the
emblazoned
hearth
with
its
imitation
logs
bristling
with
flames
of
gas
all
the
splendor
of
modern
luxury
combined
with
the
souvenirs
of
an
epoch
of
omnipotent
nobility
the
best
according
to
her
in
history
and
the
hunting
parties
the
future
hunting
parties
in
an
annex
of
sandy
and
loose
soil
with
pine
woods
in
no
way
comparable
to
the
rich
ground
of
their
native
ranch
but
which
had
the
honor
of
being
trodden
centuries
ago
by
the
princes
of
brandenburg
founders
of
the
reigning
house
of
prussia
and
all
this
advancement
in
a
single
year
they
had
of
course
to
compete
with
other
oversea
families
who
had
amassed
enormous
fortunes
in
the
united
states
brazil
or
the
pacific
coast
but
these
were
germans
without
lineage
coarse
plebeians
who
were
struggling
in
vain
to
force
themselves
into
the
great
world
by
making
donations
to
the
imperial
works
with
all
their
millions
the
very
most
that
they
could
ever
hope
to
attain
would
be
to
marry
their
daughters
with
ordinary
soldiers
whilst
karl
the
relatives
of
karl
and
the
romantica
let
her
pen
run
on
glorifying
a
family
in
whose
bosom
she
fancied
she
had
been
born
from
time
to
time
were
enclosed
with
elena
s
effusions
brief
crisp
notes
directed
to
desnoyers
the
continued
giving
an
account
of
his
operations
the
same
as
when
living
on
the
ranch
under
his
protection
but
with
this
deference
was
now
mixed
a
badly
concealed
pride
an
evident
desire
to
retaliate
for
his
times
of
voluntary
humiliation
everything
that
he
was
doing
was
grand
and
glorious
he
had
invested
his
millions
in
the
industrial
enterprises
of
modern
germany
he
was
stockholder
of
munition
factories
as
big
as
towns
and
of
navigation
companies
launching
a
ship
every
half
year
the
emperor
was
interesting
himself
in
these
works
looking
benevolently
on
all
those
who
wished
to
aid
him
besides
this
karl
was
buying
land
at
first
sight
it
seemed
foolish
to
have
sold
the
fertile
fields
of
their
inheritance
in
order
to
acquire
sandy
prussian
wastes
that
yielded
only
to
much
artificial
fertilizing
but
by
becoming
a
land
owner
he
now
belonged
to
the
agrarian
party
the
aristocratic
and
conservative
group
par
excellence
and
thus
he
was
living
in
two
different
but
equally
distinguished
worlds
that
of
the
great
industrial
friends
of
the
emperor
and
that
of
the
junkers
knights
of
the
countryside
guardians
of
the
old
traditions
and
the
of
the
officials
of
the
king
of
prussia
on
hearing
of
these
social
strides
desnoyers
could
not
but
think
of
the
pecuniary
sacrifices
which
they
must
represent
he
knew
karl
s
past
for
on
the
ranch
under
an
impulse
of
gratitude
the
german
had
one
day
revealed
to
the
frenchman
the
cause
of
his
coming
to
america
he
was
a
former
officer
in
the
german
army
but
the
desire
of
living
ostentatiously
without
other
resources
than
his
salary
had
dragged
him
into
committing
such
reprehensible
acts
as
abstracting
funds
belonging
to
the
regiment
incurring
debts
of
honor
and
paying
for
them
with
forged
signatures
these
crimes
had
not
been
officially
prosecuted
through
consideration
of
his
father
s
memory
but
the
members
of
his
division
had
submitted
him
to
a
tribunal
of
honor
his
brothers
and
friends
had
advised
him
to
shoot
himself
as
the
only
remedy
but
he
loved
life
and
had
fled
to
south
america
where
in
spite
of
humiliations
he
had
finally
triumphed
wealth
effaces
the
spots
of
the
past
even
more
rapidly
than
time
the
news
of
his
fortune
on
the
other
side
of
the
ocean
made
his
family
give
him
a
warm
reception
on
his
first
voyage
home
introducing
him
again
into
their
world
nobody
could
remember
shameful
stories
about
a
few
hundred
marks
concerning
a
man
who
was
talking
about
his
s
lands
more
extensive
than
many
german
principalities
now
upon
installing
himself
definitely
in
his
country
all
was
forgotten
but
oh
the
contributions
levied
upon
his
vanity
desnoyers
shrewdly
guessed
at
the
thousands
of
marks
poured
with
both
hands
into
the
charitable
works
of
the
empress
into
the
imperialistic
propagandas
into
the
societies
of
veterans
into
the
clubs
of
aggression
and
expansion
organized
by
german
ambition
the
frugal
frenchman
thrifty
in
his
expenditures
and
free
from
social
ambitions
smiled
at
the
grandeurs
of
his
he
considered
karl
an
excellent
companion
although
of
a
childish
pride
he
recalled
with
satisfaction
the
years
that
they
had
passed
together
in
the
country
he
could
not
forget
the
german
who
was
always
hovering
around
him
affectionate
and
submissive
as
a
younger
brother
when
his
family
commented
with
a
somewhat
envious
vivacity
upon
the
glories
of
their
berlin
relatives
desnoyers
would
say
smilingly
leave
them
in
peace
they
are
paying
very
dear
for
their
but
the
enthusiasm
which
the
letters
from
germany
breathed
finally
created
an
atmosphere
of
disquietude
and
rebellion
chichi
led
the
attack
why
were
they
not
going
to
europe
like
other
folks
all
their
friends
had
been
there
even
the
italian
and
spanish
shopkeepers
were
making
the
voyage
while
she
the
daughter
of
a
frenchman
had
never
seen
paris
oh
paris
the
doctors
in
attendance
on
melancholy
ladies
were
announcing
the
existence
of
a
new
and
terrible
disease
the
mania
for
dona
luisa
supported
her
daughter
why
had
she
not
gone
to
live
in
europe
like
her
sister
since
she
was
the
richer
of
the
two
even
julio
gravely
declared
that
in
the
old
world
he
could
study
to
better
advantage
america
is
not
the
land
of
the
learned
infected
by
the
general
unrest
the
father
finally
began
to
wonder
why
the
idea
of
going
to
europe
had
not
occurred
to
him
long
before
years
without
going
to
that
country
which
was
not
his
it
was
high
time
to
start
he
was
living
too
near
to
his
business
in
vain
the
retired
ranchman
had
tried
to
keep
himself
indifferent
to
the
money
market
everybody
was
coining
money
around
him
in
the
club
in
the
theatre
wherever
he
went
the
people
were
talking
about
purchases
of
lands
of
sales
of
stock
of
quick
negotiations
with
a
triple
profit
of
portentous
balances
the
amount
of
money
that
he
was
keeping
idle
in
the
banks
was
beginning
to
weigh
upon
him
he
finally
ended
by
involving
himself
in
some
speculation
like
a
gambler
who
can
not
see
the
roulette
wheel
without
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
his
family
was
right
to
paris
for
in
the
desnoyers
mind
to
go
to
europe
meant
of
course
to
go
to
paris
let
the
aunt
from
berlin
keep
on
chanting
the
glories
of
her
husband
s
country
it
s
sheer
nonsense
exclaimed
julio
who
had
made
grave
geographical
and
ethnic
comparisons
in
his
nightly
forays
there
is
no
place
but
paris
chichi
saluted
with
an
ironical
smile
the
slightest
doubt
of
it
perhaps
they
make
as
elegant
fashions
in
germany
as
in
paris
bah
dona
luisa
took
up
her
children
s
cry
paris
never
had
it
even
occurred
to
her
to
go
to
a
lutheran
land
to
be
protected
by
her
sister
let
it
be
paris
then
said
the
frenchman
as
though
he
were
speaking
of
an
unknown
city
he
had
accustomed
himself
to
believe
that
he
would
never
return
to
it
during
the
first
years
of
his
life
in
america
the
trip
would
have
been
an
impossibility
because
of
the
military
service
which
he
had
evaded
then
he
had
vague
news
of
different
amnesties
after
the
time
for
conscription
had
long
since
passed
an
inertness
of
will
had
made
him
consider
a
return
to
his
country
as
somewhat
absurd
and
useless
on
the
other
side
nothing
remained
to
attract
him
he
had
even
lost
track
of
those
country
relatives
with
whom
his
mother
had
lived
in
his
heaviest
hours
he
had
tried
to
occupy
his
activity
by
planning
an
enormous
mausoleum
all
of
marble
in
la
recoleta
the
cemetery
of
the
rich
in
order
to
move
thither
the
remains
of
madariaga
as
founder
of
the
dynasty
following
him
with
all
his
own
when
their
hour
should
come
he
was
beginning
to
feel
the
weight
of
age
he
was
nearly
seventy
years
old
and
the
rude
life
of
the
country
the
horseback
rides
in
the
rain
the
rivers
forded
upon
his
swimming
horse
the
nights
passed
in
the
open
air
had
brought
on
a
rheumatism
that
was
torturing
his
best
days
his
family
however
reawakened
his
enthusiasm
to
paris
he
began
to
fancy
that
he
was
twenty
again
and
forgetting
his
habitual
parsimony
wished
his
household
to
travel
like
royalty
in
the
most
luxurious
staterooms
and
with
personal
servants
two
country
girls
born
on
the
ranch
and
elevated
to
the
rank
of
maids
to
the
senora
and
her
daughter
accompanied
them
on
the
voyage
their
oblique
eyes
betraying
not
the
slightest
astonishment
before
the
greatest
novelties
once
in
paris
desnoyers
found
himself
quite
bewildered
he
confused
the
names
of
streets
proposed
visits
to
buildings
which
had
long
since
disappeared
and
all
his
attempts
to
prove
himself
an
expert
authority
on
paris
were
attended
with
disappointment
his
children
guided
by
recent
reading
up
knew
paris
better
than
he
he
was
considered
a
foreigner
in
his
own
country
at
first
he
even
felt
a
certain
strangeness
in
using
his
native
tongue
for
he
had
remained
on
the
ranch
without
speaking
a
word
of
his
language
for
years
at
a
time
he
was
used
to
thinking
in
spanish
and
translating
his
ideas
into
the
speech
of
his
ancestors
spattered
his
french
with
all
kinds
of
creole
dialect
where
a
man
makes
his
fortune
and
raises
his
family
there
is
his
true
country
he
said
sententiously
remembering
madariaga
the
image
of
that
distant
country
dominated
him
with
insistent
obsession
as
soon
as
the
impressions
of
the
voyage
had
worn
off
he
had
no
french
friends
and
upon
going
into
the
street
his
feet
instinctively
took
him
to
the
places
where
the
argentinians
gathered
together
it
was
the
same
with
them
they
had
left
their
country
only
to
feel
with
increasing
intensity
the
desire
to
talk
about
it
all
the
time
there
he
read
the
papers
commenting
on
the
rising
prices
in
the
fields
on
the
prospects
for
the
next
harvests
and
on
the
sales
of
cattle
returning
home
his
thoughts
were
still
in
america
and
he
chuckled
with
delight
as
he
recalled
the
way
in
which
the
two
chinas
had
defied
the
professional
dignity
of
the
french
cook
preparing
their
native
stews
and
other
dishes
in
creole
style
he
had
settled
the
family
in
an
ostentatious
house
in
the
avenida
victor
hugo
for
which
he
paid
a
rental
of
thousand
francs
dona
luisa
had
to
go
and
come
many
times
before
she
could
accustom
herself
to
the
imposing
aspect
of
the
concierges
he
decorated
with
gold
trimmings
on
his
black
uniform
and
wearing
white
whiskers
like
a
notary
in
a
comedy
she
with
a
chain
of
gold
upon
her
exuberant
bosom
and
receiving
the
tenants
in
a
red
and
gold
salon
in
the
rooms
above
was
luxury
gilded
and
glacial
with
white
walls
and
glass
doors
with
tiny
panes
which
exasperated
desnoyers
who
longed
for
the
complicated
carvings
and
rich
furniture
in
vogue
during
his
youth
he
himself
directed
the
arrangement
and
furnishings
of
the
various
rooms
which
always
seemed
empty
chichi
protested
against
her
father
s
avarice
when
she
saw
him
buying
slowly
and
with
much
calculation
and
hesitation
avarice
no
he
retorted
it
is
because
i
know
the
worth
of
nothing
pleased
him
that
he
had
not
acquired
at
of
its
value
beating
down
those
who
overcharged
but
proved
the
superiority
of
the
buyer
paris
offered
him
one
delightful
spot
which
he
could
not
find
anywhere
else
in
the
world
the
hotel
drouot
he
would
go
there
every
afternoon
that
he
did
not
find
other
important
auctions
advertised
in
the
papers
for
many
years
there
was
no
famous
failure
in
parisian
life
with
its
consequent
liquidation
from
which
he
did
not
carry
something
away
the
use
and
need
of
these
prizes
were
matters
of
secondary
interest
the
great
thing
was
to
get
them
for
ridiculous
prices
so
the
trophies
from
the
now
began
to
inundate
the
apartment
which
at
the
beginning
he
had
been
furnishing
with
such
desperate
slowness
his
daughter
now
complained
that
the
home
was
getting
overcrowded
the
furnishings
and
ornaments
were
handsome
but
too
many
far
too
many
the
white
walls
seemed
to
scowl
at
the
magnificent
sets
of
chairs
and
the
overflowing
glass
cabinets
rich
and
velvety
carpets
over
which
had
passed
many
generations
covered
all
the
compartments
showy
curtains
not
finding
a
vacant
frame
in
the
salons
adorned
the
doors
leading
into
the
kitchen
the
wall
mouldings
gradually
disappeared
under
an
overlay
of
pictures
placed
close
together
like
the
scales
of
a
cuirass
who
now
could
accuse
desnoyers
of
avarice
he
was
investing
far
more
than
a
fashionable
contractor
would
have
dreamed
of
spending
the
underlying
idea
still
was
to
acquire
all
this
for
a
fourth
of
its
price
an
exciting
bait
which
lured
the
economical
man
into
continuous
dissipation
he
could
sleep
well
only
when
he
had
driven
a
good
bargain
during
the
day
he
bought
at
auction
thousands
of
bottles
of
wine
consigned
by
bankrupt
firms
and
he
who
scarcely
ever
drank
packed
his
wine
cellars
to
overflowing
advising
his
family
to
use
the
champagne
as
freely
as
ordinary
wine
the
failure
of
a
furrier
induced
him
to
buy
for
fourteen
thousand
francs
pelts
worth
ninety
thousand
in
consequence
the
entire
desnoyers
family
seemed
suddenly
to
be
suffering
as
frightfully
from
cold
as
though
a
polar
iceberg
had
invaded
the
avenida
victor
hugo
the
father
kept
only
one
fur
coat
for
himself
but
ordered
three
for
his
son
chichi
and
dona
luisa
appeared
arrayed
in
all
kinds
of
silky
and
luxurious
skins
one
day
chinchilla
other
days
blue
fox
marten
or
seal
the
enraptured
buyer
would
permit
no
one
but
himself
to
adorn
the
walls
with
his
new
acquisitions
using
the
hammer
from
the
top
of
a
in
order
to
save
the
expense
of
a
professional
picture
hanger
he
wished
to
set
his
children
the
example
of
economy
in
his
idle
hours
he
would
change
the
position
of
the
heaviest
pieces
of
furniture
trying
every
kind
of
combination
this
employment
reminded
him
of
those
happy
days
when
he
handled
great
sacks
of
wheat
and
bundles
of
hides
on
the
ranch
whenever
his
son
noticed
that
he
was
looking
thoughtfully
at
a
monumental
sideboard
or
heavy
piece
he
prudently
betook
himself
to
other
haunts
desnoyers
stood
a
little
in
awe
of
the
two
very
solemn
correct
creatures
always
in
dress
suit
who
could
not
hide
their
astonishment
at
seeing
a
man
with
an
income
of
more
than
a
million
francs
engaged
in
such
work
finally
it
was
the
two
coppery
maids
who
aided
their
patron
the
three
working
contentedly
together
like
companions
in
exile
four
automobiles
completed
the
luxuriousness
of
the
family
the
children
would
have
been
more
content
with
one
small
and
dashing
in
the
very
latest
style
but
desnoyers
was
not
the
man
to
let
a
bargain
slip
past
him
so
one
after
the
other
he
had
picked
up
the
four
tempted
by
the
price
they
were
as
enormous
and
majestic
as
coaches
of
state
their
entrance
into
a
street
made
the
turn
and
stare
the
chauffeur
needed
two
assistants
to
help
him
keep
this
flock
of
mastodons
in
order
but
the
proud
owner
thought
only
of
the
skill
with
which
he
had
gotten
the
best
of
the
salesmen
anxious
to
get
such
monuments
out
of
their
sight
to
his
children
he
was
always
recommending
simplicity
and
economy
we
are
not
as
rich
as
you
suppose
we
own
a
good
deal
of
property
but
it
produces
a
scanty
and
then
after
refusing
a
domestic
expenditure
of
two
hundred
francs
he
would
put
five
thousand
into
an
unnecessary
purchase
just
because
it
would
mean
a
great
loss
to
the
seller
julio
and
his
sister
kept
protesting
to
their
mother
dona
luisa
chichi
even
going
so
far
as
to
announce
that
she
would
never
marry
a
man
like
her
father
hush
hush
exclaimed
the
scandalized
creole
he
has
his
little
peculiarities
but
he
is
very
good
never
has
he
given
me
any
cause
for
complaint
i
only
hope
that
you
may
be
lucky
enough
to
find
his
her
husband
s
quarrelsomeness
his
irritable
character
and
his
masterful
will
all
sank
into
insignificance
when
she
thought
of
his
unvarying
fidelity
in
so
many
years
of
married
life
nothing
his
faithfulness
had
been
unexceptional
even
in
the
country
where
many
surrounded
by
beasts
and
intent
on
increasing
their
flocks
had
seemed
to
become
contaminated
by
the
general
animalism
she
remembered
her
father
only
too
well
even
her
sister
was
obliged
to
live
in
apparent
calmness
with
the
vainglorious
karl
quite
capable
of
disloyalty
not
because
of
any
special
lust
but
just
to
imitate
the
doings
of
his
superiors
desnoyers
and
his
wife
were
plodding
through
life
in
a
routine
affection
reminding
dona
luisa
in
her
limited
imagination
of
the
yokes
of
oxen
on
the
ranch
who
refused
to
budge
whenever
another
animal
was
substituted
for
the
regular
companion
her
husband
certainly
was
quick
tempered
holding
her
responsible
for
all
the
whims
with
which
he
exasperated
his
children
yet
he
could
never
bear
to
have
her
out
of
his
sight
the
afternoons
at
the
hotel
drouot
would
be
most
insipid
for
him
unless
she
was
at
his
side
the
confidante
of
his
plans
and
wrathful
outbursts
there
is
to
be
a
sale
of
jewels
shall
we
go
he
would
make
this
proposition
in
such
a
gentle
and
coaxing
voice
the
voice
that
dona
luisa
remembered
in
their
first
talks
around
the
old
home
and
so
they
would
go
together
but
by
different
routes
she
in
one
of
the
monumental
vehicles
because
accustomed
to
the
leisurely
carriage
rides
of
the
ranch
she
no
longer
cared
to
walk
and
desnoyers
although
owner
of
the
four
automobiles
heartily
abominating
them
because
he
was
conservative
and
uneasy
with
the
complications
of
new
machinery
on
foot
under
the
pretext
that
through
lack
of
work
his
body
needed
the
exercise
when
they
met
in
the
crowded
salesrooms
they
proceeded
to
examine
the
jewels
together
fixing
beforehand
the
price
they
would
offer
but
he
quick
to
become
exasperated
by
opposition
always
went
further
hurling
numbers
at
his
competitors
as
though
they
were
blows
after
such
excursions
the
senora
would
appear
as
majestic
and
dazzling
as
a
basilica
of
byzantium
ears
and
neck
decorated
with
great
pearls
her
bosom
a
constellation
of
brilliants
her
hands
radiating
points
of
light
of
all
colors
of
the
rainbow
too
much
mama
chichi
would
protest
they
will
take
you
for
a
pawnbroker
s
lady
but
the
creole
satisfied
with
her
splendor
the
crowning
glory
of
a
humble
life
attributed
her
daughter
s
faultfinding
to
envy
chichi
was
only
a
girl
now
but
later
on
she
would
thank
her
for
having
collected
all
these
gems
for
her
already
the
home
was
unable
to
accommodate
so
many
purchases
in
the
cellars
were
piled
up
enough
paintings
furniture
statues
and
draperies
to
equip
several
other
dwellings
don
marcelo
began
to
complain
of
the
cramped
space
in
an
apartment
costing
thousand
francs
a
year
in
reality
large
enough
for
a
family
four
times
the
size
of
his
he
was
beginning
to
deplore
being
obliged
to
renounce
some
very
tempting
furniture
bargains
when
a
real
estate
agent
smelled
out
the
foreigner
and
relieved
him
of
his
embarrassment
why
not
buy
a
castle
the
entire
family
was
delighted
with
the
idea
an
historic
castle
the
most
historic
that
could
be
found
would
supplement
their
luxurious
establishment
chichi
paled
with
pride
some
of
her
friends
had
castles
others
of
old
colonial
family
who
were
accustomed
to
look
down
upon
her
for
her
country
bringing
up
would
now
cry
with
envy
upon
learning
of
this
acquisition
which
was
almost
a
patent
of
nobility
the
mother
smiled
in
the
hope
of
months
in
the
country
which
would
recall
the
simple
and
happy
life
of
her
youth
julio
was
less
enthusiastic
the
old
man
would
expect
him
to
spend
much
time
away
from
paris
but
he
consoled
himself
by
reflecting
that
the
suburban
place
would
provide
excuse
for
frequent
automobile
trips
desnoyers
thought
of
the
relatives
in
berlin
why
should
he
not
have
his
castle
like
the
others
the
bargains
were
alluring
historic
mansions
by
the
dozen
were
offered
him
their
owners
exhausted
by
the
expense
of
maintaining
them
were
more
than
anxious
to
sell
so
he
bought
the
castle
of
built
in
the
time
of
the
religious
wars
a
mixture
of
palace
and
fortress
with
an
italian
renaissance
facade
gloomy
towers
with
pointed
hoods
and
moats
in
which
swans
were
swimming
he
could
now
live
with
some
tracts
of
land
over
which
to
exercise
his
authority
struggling
again
with
the
resistance
of
men
and
things
besides
the
vast
proportions
of
the
rooms
of
the
castle
were
very
tempting
and
bare
of
furniture
this
opportunity
for
placing
the
overflow
from
his
cellars
plunged
him
again
into
buying
with
this
atmosphere
of
lordly
gloom
the
antiques
would
harmonize
beautifully
without
that
cry
of
protest
which
they
always
seemed
to
make
when
placed
in
contact
with
the
glaring
white
walls
of
modern
habitations
the
historic
residence
required
an
endless
outlay
on
that
account
it
had
changed
owners
so
many
times
but
he
and
the
land
understood
each
other
beautifully
so
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
filling
the
salons
he
was
going
to
begin
farming
and
in
the
extensive
parks
a
reproduction
in
miniature
of
his
enterprises
in
south
america
the
property
ought
to
be
made
not
that
he
had
any
fear
of
the
expenses
but
he
did
not
intend
to
lose
money
on
the
proposition
the
acquisition
of
the
castle
brought
desnoyers
a
true
friendship
the
chief
advantage
in
the
transaction
he
became
acquainted
with
a
neighbor
senator
lacour
who
twice
had
been
minister
of
state
and
was
now
vegetating
in
the
senate
silent
during
its
sessions
but
restless
and
voluble
in
the
corridors
in
order
to
maintain
his
influence
he
was
a
prominent
figure
of
the
republican
nobility
an
aristocrat
of
the
new
regime
that
had
sprung
from
the
agitations
of
the
revolution
just
as
the
titled
nobility
had
won
their
spurs
in
the
crusades
his
had
belonged
to
the
convention
his
father
had
figured
in
the
republic
of
he
as
the
son
of
an
exile
who
had
died
in
banishment
had
when
very
young
marched
behind
the
grandiloquent
figure
of
gambetta
and
always
spoke
in
glowing
terms
of
the
master
in
the
hope
that
some
of
his
rays
might
be
reflected
on
his
disciple
his
son
rene
a
pupil
of
the
ecole
centrale
regarded
his
father
as
a
rare
old
sport
laughing
a
little
at
his
romantic
and
humanitarian
republicanism
he
nevertheless
was
counting
much
on
that
same
official
protection
treasured
by
four
generations
of
lacours
dedicated
to
the
service
of
the
republic
to
assist
him
when
he
became
an
engineer
don
marcelo
who
used
to
look
uneasily
upon
any
new
friendship
fearing
a
demand
for
a
loan
gave
himself
up
with
enthusiasm
to
intimacy
with
this
grand
the
personage
admired
riches
and
recognized
besides
a
certain
genius
in
this
millionaire
from
the
other
side
of
the
sea
accustomed
to
speaking
of
limitless
pastures
and
immense
herds
their
intercourse
was
more
than
the
mere
friendliness
of
a
country
neighborhood
and
continued
on
after
their
return
to
paris
finally
rene
visited
the
home
on
the
avenida
victor
hugo
as
though
it
were
his
own
the
only
disappointments
in
desnoyers
new
life
came
from
his
children
chichi
irritated
him
because
of
the
independence
of
her
tastes
she
did
not
like
antiques
no
matter
how
substantial
and
magnificent
they
might
be
much
preferring
the
frivolities
of
the
latest
fashion
she
accepted
all
her
father
s
gifts
with
great
indifference
before
an
exquisite
blonde
piece
of
lace
centuries
old
picked
up
at
auction
she
made
a
wry
face
saying
i
would
much
rather
have
had
a
new
dress
costing
three
hundred
she
and
her
brother
were
solidly
opposed
to
everything
old
now
that
his
daughter
was
already
a
woman
he
had
confided
her
absolutely
to
the
care
of
dona
luisa
but
the
former
peoncito
was
not
showing
much
respect
for
the
advice
and
commands
of
the
good
natured
creole
she
had
taken
up
with
enthusiasm
regarding
it
as
the
most
elegant
of
diversions
she
would
go
every
afternoon
to
the
ice
palace
dona
luisa
chaperoning
her
although
to
do
this
she
was
obliged
to
give
up
accompanying
her
husband
to
his
sales
oh
the
hours
of
deadly
weariness
before
that
frozen
oval
ring
watching
the
white
circle
of
balancing
human
monkeys
gliding
by
on
runners
to
the
sound
of
an
organ
her
daughter
would
pass
and
repass
before
her
tired
eyes
rosy
from
the
exercise
spirals
of
hair
escaped
from
her
hat
streaming
out
behind
the
folds
of
her
skirt
swinging
above
her
skates
handsome
athletic
and
amazonian
with
the
rude
health
of
a
child
who
according
to
her
father
had
been
weaned
on
finally
dona
luisa
rebelled
against
this
troublesome
vigilance
preferring
to
accompany
her
husband
on
his
hunt
for
underpriced
riches
chichi
went
to
the
skating
rink
with
one
of
the
maids
passing
the
afternoons
with
her
sporty
friends
of
the
new
world
together
they
ventilated
their
ideas
under
the
glare
of
the
easy
life
of
paris
freed
from
the
scruples
and
conventions
of
their
native
land
they
all
thought
themselves
older
than
they
were
delighting
to
discover
in
each
other
unsuspected
charms
the
change
from
the
other
hemisphere
had
altered
their
sense
of
values
some
were
even
writing
verses
in
french
and
desnoyers
became
alarmed
giving
free
rein
to
his
bad
humor
when
chichi
of
evenings
would
bring
forth
as
aphorisms
that
which
she
and
her
friends
had
been
discussing
as
a
summary
of
their
readings
and
life
is
life
and
one
must
live
i
will
marry
the
man
i
love
no
matter
who
he
may
be
but
the
daughter
s
independence
was
as
nothing
compared
to
the
worry
which
the
other
child
gave
the
desnoyers
ay
that
other
one
julio
upon
arriving
in
paris
had
changed
the
bent
of
his
aspirations
he
no
longer
thought
of
becoming
an
engineer
he
wished
to
become
an
artist
don
marcelo
objected
in
great
consternation
but
finally
yielded
let
it
be
painting
the
important
thing
was
to
have
some
regular
profession
the
father
while
he
considered
property
and
wealth
as
sacred
rights
felt
that
no
one
should
enjoy
them
who
had
not
worked
to
acquire
them
recalling
his
apprenticeship
as
a
wood
carver
he
began
to
hope
that
the
artistic
instincts
which
poverty
had
extinguished
in
him
were
perhaps
reappearing
in
his
son
what
if
this
lazy
boy
this
lively
genius
hesitating
before
taking
up
his
walk
in
life
should
turn
out
to
be
a
famous
painter
after
all
so
he
agreed
to
all
of
julio
s
caprices
the
budding
artist
insisting
that
for
his
first
efforts
in
drawing
and
coloring
he
needed
a
separate
apartment
where
he
could
work
with
more
freedom
his
father
therefore
established
him
near
his
home
in
the
rue
de
la
pompe
in
the
former
studio
of
a
foreign
painter
the
workroom
and
its
annexes
were
far
too
large
for
an
amateur
but
the
owner
had
died
and
desnoyers
improved
the
opportunity
offered
by
the
heirs
and
bought
at
a
remarkable
bargain
the
entire
plant
pictures
and
furnishings
dona
luisa
at
first
visited
the
studio
daily
like
a
good
mother
caring
for
the
of
her
son
that
he
may
work
to
better
advantage
taking
off
her
gloves
she
emptied
the
brass
trays
filled
with
cigar
stubs
and
dusted
the
furniture
powdered
with
the
ashes
fallen
from
the
pipes
julio
s
visitors
young
men
who
spoke
of
things
that
she
could
not
understand
seemed
to
her
rather
careless
in
their
manners
later
on
she
also
met
there
women
very
lightly
clad
and
was
received
with
scowls
by
her
son
wasn
t
his
mother
ever
going
to
let
him
work
in
peace
so
the
poor
lady
starting
out
in
the
morning
toward
the
rue
de
la
pompe
stopped
midway
and
went
instead
to
the
church
of
saint
honore
d
eylau
the
father
displayed
more
prudence
a
man
of
his
years
could
not
expect
to
mingle
with
the
chums
of
a
young
artist
in
a
few
months
time
julio
passed
entire
weeks
without
going
to
sleep
under
the
paternal
roof
finally
he
installed
himself
permanently
in
his
studio
occasionally
making
a
flying
trip
home
that
his
family
might
know
that
he
was
still
in
existence
some
mornings
desnoyers
would
arrive
at
the
rue
de
la
pompe
in
order
to
ask
a
few
questions
of
the
concierge
it
was
ten
o
clock
the
artist
was
sleeping
upon
returning
at
midday
he
learned
that
the
heavy
sleep
still
continued
soon
after
lunch
another
visit
to
get
better
news
it
was
two
o
clock
the
young
gentleman
was
just
arising
so
the
father
would
retire
muttering
stormily
but
when
does
this
painter
ever
paint
at
first
julio
had
tried
to
win
renown
with
his
brush
believing
that
it
would
prove
an
easy
task
in
true
artist
fashion
he
collected
his
friends
around
him
south
american
boys
with
nothing
to
do
but
enjoy
life
scattering
money
ostentatiously
so
that
everybody
might
know
of
their
generosity
with
serene
audacity
the
young
undertook
to
paint
portraits
he
loved
good
painting
distinctive
painting
with
the
cloying
sweetness
of
a
romance
that
copied
only
the
forms
of
women
he
had
money
a
good
studio
his
father
was
standing
behind
him
ready
to
help
why
shouldn
t
he
accomplish
as
much
as
many
others
who
lacked
his
opportunities
so
he
began
his
work
by
coloring
a
canvas
entitled
the
dance
of
the
hours
a
mere
pretext
for
copying
pretty
girls
and
selecting
buxom
models
these
he
would
sketch
at
a
mad
speed
filling
in
the
outlines
with
blobs
of
paint
and
up
to
this
point
all
went
well
then
he
would
begin
to
vacillate
remaining
idle
before
the
picture
only
to
put
it
in
the
corner
in
hope
of
later
inspiration
it
was
the
same
way
with
his
various
studies
of
feminine
heads
finding
that
he
was
never
able
to
finish
anything
he
soon
became
resigned
like
one
who
pants
with
fatigue
before
an
obstacle
waiting
for
a
providential
interposition
to
save
him
the
important
thing
was
to
be
a
painter
even
though
he
might
not
paint
anything
this
afforded
him
the
opportunity
on
the
plea
of
lofty
aestheticism
of
sending
out
cards
of
invitation
and
asking
light
women
to
his
studio
he
lived
during
the
night
don
marcelo
upon
investigating
the
artist
s
work
could
not
contain
his
indignation
every
morning
the
two
desnoyers
were
accustomed
to
greet
the
first
hours
of
dawn
the
father
leaping
from
his
bed
the
son
on
his
way
home
to
his
studio
to
throw
himself
upon
his
couch
not
to
wake
till
midday
the
credulous
dona
luisa
would
invent
the
most
absurd
explanations
to
defend
her
son
who
could
tell
perhaps
he
had
the
habit
of
painting
during
the
night
utilizing
it
for
original
work
men
resort
to
so
many
devilish
things
desnoyers
knew
very
well
what
these
nocturnal
gusts
of
genius
were
amounting
to
scandals
in
the
restaurants
of
montmartre
and
scrimmages
many
scrimmages
he
and
his
gang
who
believed
that
at
seven
a
full
dress
or
tuxedo
was
indispensable
were
like
a
band
of
indians
bringing
to
paris
the
wild
customs
of
the
plains
champagne
always
made
them
quarrelsome
so
they
broke
and
paid
but
their
generosities
were
almost
invariably
followed
by
a
scuffle
no
one
could
surpass
julio
in
the
quick
slap
and
the
ready
card
his
father
heard
with
a
heavy
heart
the
news
brought
him
by
some
friends
thinking
to
flatter
his
vanity
his
son
was
always
victorious
in
these
gentlemanly
encounters
he
it
was
who
always
scratched
the
enemy
s
skin
the
painter
knew
more
about
fencing
than
art
he
was
a
champion
with
various
weapons
he
could
box
and
was
even
skilled
in
the
favorite
blows
of
the
prize
fighters
of
the
slums
useless
as
a
drone
and
as
dangerous
too
fretted
his
father
and
yet
in
the
back
of
his
troubled
mind
fluttered
an
irresistible
satisfaction
an
animal
pride
in
the
thought
that
this
terror
was
his
own
for
a
while
he
thought
that
he
had
hit
upon
a
way
of
withdrawing
his
son
from
such
an
existence
the
relatives
in
berlin
had
visited
the
desnoyers
in
their
castle
of
villeblanche
with
superiority
karl
von
hartrott
had
appreciated
the
rich
and
rather
absurd
accumulations
of
his
they
were
not
bad
he
admitted
that
they
gave
a
certain
cachet
to
the
home
in
paris
and
to
the
castle
they
smacked
of
the
possessions
of
titled
nobility
but
germany
the
comforts
and
luxuries
in
his
country
he
just
wished
his
to
admire
the
way
he
lived
and
the
noble
friendships
that
embellished
his
opulence
and
so
he
insisted
in
his
letters
that
the
desnoyers
family
should
return
their
visit
this
change
of
environment
might
tone
julio
down
a
little
perhaps
his
ambition
might
waken
on
seeing
the
diligence
of
his
cousins
each
with
a
career
the
frenchman
had
besides
an
underlying
belief
in
the
more
corrupt
influence
of
paris
as
compared
with
the
purity
of
the
customs
in
patriarchal
germany
they
were
there
four
months
in
a
little
while
desnoyers
felt
ready
to
retreat
each
to
his
own
kind
he
would
never
be
able
to
understand
such
people
exceedingly
amiable
with
an
abject
amiability
and
evident
desire
to
please
but
constantly
blundering
through
a
tactless
desire
to
make
their
grandeur
felt
the
friends
of
hartrott
emphasized
their
love
for
france
but
it
was
the
pious
love
that
a
weak
and
mischievous
child
inspires
needing
protection
and
they
would
accompany
their
affability
with
all
manner
of
inopportune
memories
of
the
wars
in
which
france
had
been
conquered
everything
in
germany
a
monument
a
railroad
station
a
simple
device
instantly
gave
rise
to
glorious
comparisons
in
france
you
do
not
have
this
of
course
you
never
saw
anything
like
this
in
don
marcelo
came
away
fatigued
by
so
much
condescension
and
his
wife
and
daughter
refused
to
be
convinced
that
the
elegance
of
berlin
could
be
superior
to
paris
chichi
with
audacious
sacrilege
scandalized
her
cousins
by
declaring
that
she
could
not
abide
the
corseted
officers
with
immovable
monocle
who
bowed
to
the
women
with
such
automatic
rigidity
blending
their
gallantries
with
an
air
of
superiority
julio
guided
by
his
cousins
was
saturated
in
the
virtuous
atmosphere
of
berlin
with
the
oldest
the
sage
he
had
nothing
to
do
he
was
a
poor
creature
devoted
to
his
books
who
patronized
all
the
family
with
a
protecting
air
it
was
the
others
the
or
military
students
who
proudly
showed
him
the
rounds
of
german
joy
julio
was
accordingly
introduced
to
all
the
night
restaurants
imitations
of
those
in
paris
but
on
a
much
larger
scale
the
women
who
in
paris
might
be
counted
by
the
dozens
appeared
here
in
hundreds
the
scandalous
drunkenness
here
never
came
by
chance
but
always
by
design
as
an
indispensable
part
of
the
gaiety
all
was
grandiose
glittering
colossal
the
libertines
diverted
themselves
in
platoons
the
public
got
drunk
in
companies
the
harlots
presented
themselves
in
regiments
he
felt
a
sensation
of
disgust
before
these
timid
and
servile
females
accustomed
to
blows
who
were
so
eagerly
trying
to
reimburse
themselves
for
the
losses
and
exposures
of
their
business
for
him
it
was
impossible
to
celebrate
with
hoarse
like
his
cousins
the
discomfiture
of
these
women
when
they
realized
that
they
had
wasted
so
many
hours
without
accomplishing
more
than
abundant
drinking
the
gross
obscenity
so
public
and
noisy
like
a
parade
of
riches
was
loathsome
to
julio
there
is
nothing
like
this
in
paris
his
cousins
repeatedly
exulted
as
they
admired
the
stupendous
salons
the
hundreds
of
men
and
women
in
pairs
the
thousands
of
tipplers
no
there
certainly
was
nothing
like
that
in
he
was
sick
of
such
boundless
pretension
he
seemed
to
be
attending
a
fiesta
of
hungry
mariners
anxious
at
one
swoop
to
make
amends
for
all
former
privations
like
his
father
he
longed
to
get
away
it
offended
his
aesthetic
sense
don
marcelo
returned
from
this
visit
with
melancholy
resignation
those
people
had
undoubtedly
made
great
strides
he
was
not
such
a
blind
patriot
that
he
could
not
admit
what
was
so
evident
within
a
few
years
they
had
transformed
their
country
and
their
industry
was
astonishing
but
well
it
was
simply
impossible
to
have
anything
to
do
with
them
each
to
his
own
but
may
they
never
take
a
notion
to
envy
their
neighbor
then
he
immediately
repelled
this
last
suspicion
with
the
optimism
of
a
business
man
they
are
going
to
be
very
rich
he
thought
their
affairs
are
prospering
and
he
that
is
rich
does
not
hunt
quarrels
that
war
of
which
some
crazy
fools
are
always
dreaming
would
be
an
impossible
young
desnoyers
renewed
his
parisian
existence
living
entirely
in
the
studio
and
going
less
and
less
to
his
father
s
home
dona
luisa
began
to
speak
of
a
certain
argensola
a
very
learned
young
spaniard
believing
that
his
counsels
might
prove
most
helpful
to
julio
she
did
not
know
exactly
whether
this
new
companion
was
friend
master
or
servant
the
studio
habitues
also
had
their
doubts
the
literary
ones
always
spoke
of
argensola
as
a
painter
the
painters
recognized
only
his
ability
as
a
man
of
letters
he
was
among
those
who
used
to
come
up
to
the
studio
of
winter
afternoons
attracted
by
the
ruddy
glow
of
the
stove
and
the
wines
secretly
provided
by
the
mother
holding
forth
authoritatively
before
the
bottle
and
the
box
of
cigars
lying
open
on
the
table
one
night
he
slept
on
the
divan
as
he
had
no
regular
quarters
after
that
first
night
he
lived
entirely
in
the
studio
julio
soon
discovered
in
him
an
admirable
reflex
of
his
own
personality
he
knew
that
argensola
had
come
from
madrid
with
twenty
francs
in
his
pocket
in
order
to
capture
glory
to
use
his
own
words
upon
observing
that
the
spaniard
was
painting
with
as
much
difficulty
as
himself
with
the
same
wooden
and
childish
strokes
which
are
so
characteristic
of
the
artists
and
the
routine
workers
concerned
themselves
with
color
and
other
rank
fads
argensola
was
a
psychological
artist
a
painter
of
souls
and
his
disciple
felt
astonished
and
almost
displeased
on
learning
what
a
comparatively
simple
thing
it
was
to
paint
a
soul
upon
a
bloodless
countenance
with
a
chin
as
sharp
as
a
dagger
the
gifted
spaniard
would
trace
a
pair
of
nearly
round
eyes
and
at
the
centre
of
each
pupil
he
would
aim
a
white
brush
stroke
a
point
of
light
the
soul
then
planting
himself
before
the
canvas
he
would
proceed
to
classify
this
soul
with
his
inexhaustible
imagination
attributing
to
it
almost
every
kind
of
stress
and
extremity
so
great
was
the
sway
of
his
rapture
that
julio
too
was
able
to
see
all
that
the
artist
flattered
himself
into
believing
that
he
had
put
into
the
owlish
eyes
he
also
would
paint
souls
souls
of
women
in
spite
of
the
ease
with
which
he
developed
his
psychological
creations
argensola
preferred
to
talk
stretched
on
a
divan
or
to
read
hugging
the
fire
while
his
friend
and
protector
was
outside
another
advantage
this
fondness
for
reading
gave
young
desnoyers
was
that
he
was
no
longer
obliged
to
open
a
volume
scanning
the
index
and
last
pages
just
to
get
the
formerly
when
frequenting
society
functions
he
had
been
guilty
of
coolly
asking
an
author
which
was
his
best
book
his
smile
of
a
clever
man
giving
the
writer
to
understand
that
he
merely
enquired
so
as
not
to
waste
time
on
the
other
volumes
now
it
was
no
longer
necessary
to
do
this
argensola
would
read
for
him
as
soon
as
julio
would
see
him
absorbed
in
a
book
he
would
demand
an
immediate
share
tell
me
the
so
the
secretary
not
only
gave
him
the
plots
of
comedies
and
novels
but
also
detailed
the
argument
of
schopenhauer
or
of
nietzsche
dona
luisa
almost
wept
on
hearing
her
visitors
with
that
benevolence
which
wealth
always
inspires
speak
of
her
son
as
a
rather
gay
young
man
but
wonderfully
well
read
in
exchange
for
his
lessons
argensola
received
much
the
same
treatment
as
did
the
greek
slaves
who
taught
rhetoric
to
the
young
patricians
of
decadent
rome
in
the
midst
of
a
dissertation
his
lord
and
friend
would
interrupt
him
with
get
my
dress
suit
ready
i
am
invited
out
this
at
other
times
when
the
instructor
was
luxuriating
in
bodily
comfort
with
a
book
in
one
hand
near
the
roaring
stove
seeing
through
the
windows
the
gray
and
rainy
afternoon
his
disciple
would
suddenly
appear
saying
quick
get
out
there
s
a
woman
coming
and
argensola
like
a
dog
who
gets
up
and
shakes
himself
would
disappear
to
continue
his
reading
in
some
miserable
little
coffee
house
in
the
neighborhood
in
his
official
capacity
this
widely
gifted
man
often
descended
from
the
peaks
of
intellectuality
to
the
vulgarities
of
everyday
life
he
was
the
steward
of
the
lord
of
the
manor
the
intermediary
between
the
pocketbook
and
those
who
appeared
bill
in
hand
money
he
would
say
laconically
at
the
end
of
the
month
and
desnoyers
would
break
out
into
complaints
and
curses
where
on
earth
was
he
to
get
it
he
would
like
to
know
his
father
was
as
regular
as
a
machine
and
would
never
allow
the
slightest
advance
upon
the
following
month
he
had
to
submit
to
a
rule
of
misery
three
thousand
francs
a
month
what
could
any
decent
person
do
with
that
he
was
even
trying
to
cut
that
down
to
tighten
the
band
interfering
in
the
running
of
his
house
so
that
dona
luisa
could
not
make
presents
to
her
son
in
vain
he
had
appealed
to
the
various
usurers
of
paris
telling
them
of
his
property
beyond
the
ocean
these
gentlemen
had
the
youth
of
their
own
country
in
the
hollow
of
their
hand
and
were
not
obliged
to
risk
their
capital
in
other
lands
the
same
hard
luck
pursued
him
when
with
sudden
demonstrations
of
affection
he
had
tried
to
convince
don
marcelo
that
three
thousand
francs
a
month
was
but
a
niggardly
trifle
the
millionaire
fairly
snorted
with
indignation
three
thousand
francs
a
trifle
and
the
debts
besides
that
he
often
had
to
pay
for
his
son
why
when
i
was
your
age
he
would
begin
saying
but
julio
would
suddenly
bring
the
dialogue
to
a
close
he
had
heard
his
father
s
story
too
many
times
ah
the
stingy
old
miser
what
he
had
been
giving
him
all
these
months
was
no
more
than
the
interest
on
his
grandfather
s
legacy
and
by
the
advice
of
argensola
he
ventured
to
get
control
of
the
field
he
was
planning
to
hand
over
the
management
of
his
land
to
celedonio
the
old
overseer
who
was
now
such
a
grandee
in
his
country
that
julio
ironically
called
him
my
desnoyers
accepted
this
rebellion
coldly
it
appears
just
to
me
you
are
now
of
age
then
he
promptly
reduced
to
extremes
his
oversight
of
his
home
forbidding
dona
luisa
to
handle
any
money
henceforth
he
regarded
his
son
as
an
adversary
treating
him
during
his
lightning
apparitions
at
the
avenue
victor
hugo
with
glacial
courtesy
as
though
he
were
a
stranger
for
a
while
a
transitory
opulence
enlivened
the
studio
julio
had
increased
his
expenses
considering
himself
rich
but
the
letters
from
his
uncle
in
america
soon
dissipated
these
illusions
at
first
the
remittances
exceeded
very
slightly
the
monthly
allowance
that
his
father
had
made
him
then
it
began
to
diminish
in
an
alarming
manner
according
to
celedonio
all
the
calamities
on
earth
seemed
to
be
falling
upon
his
plantation
the
pasture
land
was
yielding
scantily
sometimes
for
lack
of
rain
sometimes
because
of
floods
and
the
herds
were
perishing
by
hundreds
julio
required
more
income
and
the
crafty
sent
him
what
he
asked
for
but
simply
as
a
loan
reserving
the
return
until
they
should
adjust
their
accounts
in
spite
of
such
aid
young
desnoyers
was
suffering
great
want
he
was
gambling
now
in
an
elegant
circle
thinking
thus
to
compensate
for
his
periodical
scrimpings
but
this
resort
was
only
making
the
remittances
from
america
disappear
with
greater
rapidity
that
such
a
man
as
he
was
should
be
tormented
so
for
the
lack
of
a
few
thousand
francs
what
else
was
a
millionaire
father
for
if
the
creditors
began
threatening
the
poor
youth
had
to
bring
the
secretary
into
play
ordering
him
to
see
the
mother
immediately
he
himself
wished
to
avoid
her
tears
and
reproaches
so
argensola
would
slip
like
a
pickpocket
up
the
service
stairway
of
the
great
house
on
the
avenue
victor
hugo
the
place
in
which
he
transacted
his
ambassadorial
business
was
the
kitchen
with
great
danger
that
the
terrible
desnoyers
might
happen
in
there
on
one
of
his
perambulations
as
a
laboring
man
and
surprise
the
intruder
dona
luisa
would
weep
touched
by
the
heartrending
tales
of
the
messenger
what
could
she
do
she
was
as
poor
as
her
maids
she
had
jewels
many
jewels
but
not
a
franc
then
argensola
came
to
the
rescue
with
a
solution
worthy
of
his
experience
he
would
smooth
the
way
for
the
good
mother
leaving
some
of
her
jewels
at
the
he
knew
the
way
to
raise
money
on
them
so
the
lady
accepted
his
advice
giving
him
however
only
jewels
of
medium
value
as
she
suspected
that
she
might
never
see
them
again
later
scruples
made
her
at
times
refuse
flatly
suppose
don
marcelo
should
ever
find
it
out
what
a
scene
but
the
spaniard
deemed
it
unseemly
to
return
and
always
bore
away
a
basket
of
bottles
from
the
of
the
desnoyers
every
morning
dona
luisa
went
to
eylau
to
pray
for
her
son
she
felt
that
this
was
her
own
church
it
was
a
hospitable
and
familiar
island
in
the
unexplored
ocean
of
paris
here
she
could
exchange
discreet
salutations
with
her
neighbors
from
the
different
republics
of
the
new
world
she
felt
nearer
to
god
and
the
saints
when
she
could
hear
in
the
vestibule
conversations
in
her
language
it
was
moreover
a
sort
of
salon
in
which
took
place
the
great
events
of
the
south
american
colony
one
day
was
a
wedding
with
flowers
orchestra
and
chanting
chorals
with
chichi
beside
her
she
greeted
those
she
knew
congratulating
the
bride
and
groom
another
day
it
was
the
funeral
of
an
of
some
republic
or
some
other
foreign
dignitary
ending
in
paris
his
turbulent
existence
poor
president
poor
general
dona
luisa
remembered
the
dead
man
she
had
seen
him
many
times
in
that
church
devoutly
attending
mass
and
she
was
indignant
at
the
evil
tongues
which
under
the
cover
of
a
funeral
oration
recalled
the
shootings
and
bank
failures
in
his
country
such
a
good
and
religious
gentleman
may
god
receive
his
soul
in
glory
and
upon
going
out
into
the
square
she
would
look
with
tender
eyes
upon
the
young
men
and
women
on
horseback
going
to
the
bois
de
boulogne
the
luxurious
automobiles
the
morning
radiant
in
the
sunshine
all
the
primeval
freshness
of
the
early
hours
realizing
what
a
beautiful
thing
it
is
to
live
her
devout
expression
of
gratitude
for
mere
existence
usually
included
the
monument
in
the
centre
of
the
square
all
bristling
with
wings
as
if
about
to
fly
away
from
the
ground
victor
hugo
it
was
enough
for
her
to
have
heard
this
name
on
the
lips
of
her
son
to
make
her
contemplate
the
statue
with
a
family
interest
the
only
thing
that
she
knew
about
the
poet
was
that
he
had
died
of
this
she
was
almost
sure
and
she
imagined
that
in
life
he
was
a
great
friend
of
julio
s
because
she
had
so
often
heard
her
son
repeat
his
name
ay
her
son
all
her
thoughts
her
conjectures
her
desires
converged
on
him
and
her
husband
she
longed
for
the
men
to
come
to
an
understanding
and
put
an
end
to
a
struggle
in
which
she
was
the
principal
victim
would
not
god
work
this
miracle
like
an
invalid
who
goes
from
one
sanitarium
to
another
in
pursuit
of
health
she
gave
up
the
church
on
her
street
to
attend
the
spanish
chapel
on
the
avenue
friedland
here
she
considered
herself
even
more
among
her
own
in
the
midst
of
the
fine
and
elegant
south
american
ladies
who
looked
as
if
they
had
just
escaped
from
a
fashion
sheet
her
eyes
sought
other
women
not
so
well
dressed
fat
with
theatrical
ermine
and
antique
jewelry
when
these
dames
met
each
other
in
the
vestibule
they
spoke
with
heavy
voices
and
expressive
gestures
emphasizing
their
words
energetically
the
daughter
of
the
ranch
ventured
to
salute
them
because
she
had
subscribed
to
all
their
pet
charities
and
upon
seeing
her
greeting
returned
she
felt
a
satisfaction
which
made
her
momentarily
forget
her
woes
they
belonged
to
those
families
which
her
father
had
so
greatly
admired
without
knowing
why
they
came
from
the
mother
country
and
to
the
good
chicha
were
all
excelentisimas
or
altisimas
related
to
kings
she
did
not
know
whether
to
give
them
her
hand
or
bend
the
knee
as
she
had
vaguely
heard
was
the
custom
at
court
but
soon
she
recalled
her
preoccupation
and
went
forward
to
wrestle
in
prayer
with
god
ay
that
he
would
mercifully
remember
her
that
he
would
not
long
forget
her
son
it
was
glory
that
remembered
julio
stretching
out
to
him
her
arms
of
light
so
that
he
suddenly
awoke
to
find
himself
surrounded
by
all
the
honors
and
advantages
of
celebrity
fame
cunningly
surprises
mankind
on
the
most
crooked
and
unexpected
of
roads
neither
the
painting
of
souls
nor
a
fitful
existence
full
of
extravagant
love
affairs
and
complicated
duels
had
brought
desnoyers
this
renown
it
was
glory
that
put
him
on
his
feet
a
new
pleasure
for
the
delight
of
humanity
had
come
from
the
other
side
of
the
seas
people
were
asking
one
another
in
the
mysterious
tones
of
the
initiated
who
wish
to
recognize
a
familiar
spirit
do
you
know
how
to
tango
the
tango
had
taken
possession
of
the
world
it
was
the
heroic
hymn
of
a
humanity
that
was
suddenly
concentrating
its
aspirations
on
the
harmonious
rhythm
of
the
thigh
joints
measuring
its
intelligence
by
the
agility
of
its
feet
an
incoherent
and
monotonous
music
of
african
inspiration
was
satisfying
the
artistic
ideals
of
a
society
that
required
nothing
better
the
world
was
dancing
dancing
dancing
a
negro
dance
from
cuba
introduced
into
south
america
by
mariners
who
shipped
jerked
beef
to
the
antilles
conquered
the
entire
earth
in
a
few
months
completely
encircling
it
bounding
victoriously
from
nation
to
nation
like
the
marseillaise
it
was
even
penetrating
into
the
most
ceremonious
courts
overturning
all
traditions
of
conservation
and
etiquette
like
a
song
of
the
revolution
the
revolution
of
frivolity
the
pope
even
had
to
become
a
master
of
the
dance
recommending
the
furlana
instead
of
the
tango
since
all
the
christian
world
regardless
of
sects
was
united
in
the
common
desire
to
agitate
its
feet
with
the
tireless
frenzy
of
the
possessed
of
the
middle
ages
julio
desnoyers
upon
meeting
this
dance
of
his
childhood
in
full
swing
in
paris
devoted
himself
to
it
with
the
confidence
that
an
old
love
inspires
who
could
have
foretold
that
when
as
a
student
he
was
frequenting
the
lowest
dance
halls
in
buenos
aires
watched
by
the
police
that
he
was
really
serving
an
apprenticeship
to
glory
from
five
to
seven
in
the
salons
of
the
champs
d
elysees
where
it
cost
five
francs
for
a
cup
of
tea
and
the
privilege
of
joining
in
the
sacred
dance
hundreds
of
eyes
followed
him
with
admiration
he
has
the
key
said
the
women
appraising
his
slender
elegance
medium
stature
and
muscular
springs
and
he
in
abbreviated
jacket
and
expansive
shirt
bosom
with
his
small
girlish
feet
encased
in
patent
leathers
with
white
tops
danced
gravely
thoughtfully
silently
like
a
mathematician
working
out
a
problem
under
the
lights
that
shed
bluish
tones
upon
his
plastered
glossy
locks
ladies
asked
to
be
presented
to
him
in
the
sweet
hope
that
their
friends
might
envy
them
when
they
beheld
them
in
the
arms
of
the
master
invitations
simply
rained
upon
julio
the
most
exclusive
salons
were
thrown
open
to
him
so
that
every
afternoon
he
made
a
dozen
new
acquaintances
the
fashion
had
brought
over
professors
from
the
other
side
of
the
sea
compatriots
from
the
slums
of
buenos
aires
haughty
and
confused
at
being
applauded
like
famous
lecturers
or
tenors
but
julio
triumphed
over
these
vulgarians
who
danced
for
money
and
the
incidents
of
his
former
life
were
considered
by
the
women
as
deeds
of
romantic
gallantry
you
are
killing
yourself
argensola
would
say
you
are
dancing
too
the
glory
of
his
friend
and
master
was
only
making
more
trouble
for
him
his
placid
readings
before
the
fire
were
now
subject
to
daily
interruptions
it
was
impossible
to
read
more
than
a
chapter
the
celebrated
man
was
continually
ordering
him
to
betake
himself
to
the
street
a
new
lesson
sighed
the
parasite
and
when
he
was
alone
in
the
studio
numerous
callers
all
women
some
inquisitive
and
aggressive
others
sad
with
a
deserted
air
were
constantly
interrupting
his
thoughtful
pursuits
one
of
them
terrified
the
occupants
of
the
studio
with
her
insistence
she
was
a
north
american
of
uncertain
age
somewhere
between
and
with
short
skirts
that
whenever
she
sat
down
seemed
to
fly
up
as
if
moved
by
a
spring
various
dances
with
desnoyers
and
a
visit
to
the
rue
de
la
pompe
she
seemed
to
consider
as
her
sacred
rights
and
she
pursued
the
master
with
the
desperation
of
an
abandoned
zealot
julio
had
made
good
his
escape
upon
learning
that
this
beauty
of
youthful
elegance
when
seen
from
the
back
had
two
grandchildren
master
desnoyers
has
gone
out
argensola
would
invariably
say
upon
receiving
her
and
thereupon
she
would
burst
into
tears
and
threats
longing
to
kill
herself
then
and
there
that
her
corpse
might
frighten
away
those
other
women
who
would
come
to
rob
her
of
what
she
considered
her
special
privilege
now
it
was
argensola
who
sped
his
companion
to
the
street
when
he
wished
to
be
alone
he
had
only
to
remark
casually
i
believe
that
yankee
is
coming
and
the
great
man
would
beat
a
hasty
retreat
oftentimes
in
his
desperate
flight
availing
himself
of
the
back
stairs
at
this
time
began
to
develop
the
most
important
event
in
julio
s
existence
the
desnoyers
family
was
to
be
united
with
that
of
senator
lacour
rene
his
only
son
had
succeeded
in
awakening
in
chichi
a
certain
interest
that
was
almost
love
the
dignitary
enjoyed
thinking
of
his
son
allied
to
the
boundless
plains
and
immense
herds
whose
description
always
affected
him
like
a
marvellous
tale
he
was
a
widower
but
he
enjoyed
giving
at
his
home
famous
banquets
and
parties
every
new
celebrity
immediately
suggested
to
him
the
idea
of
giving
a
dinner
no
illustrious
person
passing
through
paris
polar
explorer
or
famous
singer
could
escape
being
exhibited
in
the
dining
room
of
lacour
the
son
of
desnoyers
at
whom
he
had
scarcely
glanced
before
now
inspired
him
with
sudden
interest
the
senator
was
a
thoroughly
man
who
did
not
classify
glory
nor
distinguish
reputations
it
was
enough
for
him
that
a
name
should
be
on
everybody
s
lips
for
him
to
accept
it
with
enthusiasm
when
julio
responded
to
his
invitation
he
presented
him
with
pride
to
his
friends
and
came
very
near
to
calling
him
dear
the
tango
was
monopolizing
all
conversation
nowadays
even
in
the
academy
they
were
taking
it
up
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
the
youth
of
ancient
athens
had
diverted
itself
in
a
somewhat
similar
way
and
lacour
had
dreamed
all
his
life
of
an
athenian
republic
at
these
reunions
desnoyers
became
acquainted
with
the
lauriers
he
was
an
engineer
who
owned
a
for
automobiles
in
the
outskirts
of
paris
a
man
about
tall
rather
heavy
and
silent
with
a
deliberate
air
as
though
he
wished
to
see
deeply
into
men
and
things
she
was
of
a
light
frivolous
character
loving
life
for
the
satisfactions
and
pleasures
which
it
brought
her
appearing
to
accept
with
smiling
conformity
the
silent
and
grave
adoration
of
her
husband
she
could
not
well
do
less
with
a
man
of
his
merits
besides
she
had
brought
to
the
marriage
a
dowry
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
a
capital
which
had
enabled
the
engineer
to
enlarge
his
business
the
senator
had
been
instrumental
in
arranging
this
marriage
he
was
interested
in
laurier
because
he
was
the
son
of
an
old
friend
upon
marguerite
laurier
the
presence
of
julio
flashed
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
in
the
tiresome
salon
of
lacour
she
was
dancing
the
fad
of
the
hour
and
frequenting
the
tango
teas
where
reigned
the
adored
desnoyers
and
to
think
that
she
was
being
entertained
with
this
celebrated
and
interesting
man
that
the
other
women
were
raving
about
in
order
that
he
might
not
take
her
for
a
mere
woman
like
the
other
guests
at
the
senator
s
party
she
spoke
of
her
modistes
all
from
the
rue
de
la
paix
declaring
gravely
that
no
woman
who
had
any
could
possibly
walk
through
the
streets
wearing
a
gown
costing
less
than
eight
hundred
francs
and
that
the
hat
of
a
thousand
francs
but
a
few
years
ago
an
astonishing
novelty
was
nowadays
a
very
ordinary
affair
this
acquaintanceship
made
the
little
laurier
as
her
friends
called
her
notwithstanding
her
tallness
much
sought
by
the
master
of
the
dance
in
spite
of
the
looks
of
wrath
and
envy
hurled
at
her
by
the
others
what
a
triumph
for
the
wife
of
a
simple
engineer
who
was
used
to
going
everywhere
in
her
mother
s
automobile
julio
at
first
had
supposed
her
like
all
the
others
who
were
languishing
in
his
arms
following
the
rhythmic
complications
of
the
dance
but
he
soon
found
that
she
was
very
different
her
coquetry
after
the
first
confidential
words
but
increased
his
admiration
he
really
had
never
before
been
thrown
with
a
woman
of
her
class
those
of
his
first
social
period
were
the
habituees
of
the
night
restaurants
paid
for
their
witchery
now
glory
was
tossing
into
his
arms
ladies
of
high
position
but
with
an
unconfessable
past
anxious
for
novelties
although
exceedingly
mature
this
middle
class
woman
who
would
advance
so
confidently
toward
him
and
then
retreat
with
such
capricious
outbursts
of
modesty
was
a
new
type
for
him
the
tango
salons
soon
began
to
suffer
a
great
loss
desnoyers
was
permitting
himself
to
be
seen
there
with
less
frequency
handing
glory
over
to
the
professionals
sometimes
entire
weeks
slipped
by
without
the
devotees
being
able
to
admire
his
black
locks
and
his
tiny
patent
leathers
twinkling
under
the
lights
in
time
with
his
graceful
movements
marguerite
was
also
avoiding
these
places
the
meetings
of
the
two
were
taking
place
in
accordance
with
what
she
had
read
in
the
love
stories
of
paris
she
was
going
in
search
of
julio
fearing
to
be
recognized
tremulous
with
emotion
selecting
her
most
inconspicuous
suit
and
covering
her
face
with
a
close
veil
the
veil
of
adultery
as
her
friends
called
it
they
had
their
trysts
in
the
squares
of
the
district
frequently
changing
the
places
like
timid
birds
that
at
the
slightest
disturbance
fly
to
perch
a
little
further
away
sometimes
they
would
meet
in
the
buttes
chaumont
at
others
they
preferred
the
gardens
on
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
the
luxembourg
and
even
the
distant
parc
de
montsouris
she
was
always
in
tremors
of
terror
lest
her
husband
might
surprise
them
although
she
well
knew
that
the
industrious
engineer
was
in
his
factory
a
great
distance
away
her
agitated
aspect
her
excessive
precautions
in
order
to
slip
by
unseen
only
served
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
although
julio
was
waxing
impatient
with
the
annoyance
of
this
wandering
love
affair
which
only
amounted
to
a
few
fugitive
kisses
he
finally
held
his
peace
dominated
by
marguerite
s
pleadings
she
did
not
wish
merely
to
be
one
in
the
procession
of
his
sweethearts
it
was
necessary
to
convince
herself
first
that
this
love
was
going
to
last
forever
it
was
her
first
slip
and
she
wanted
it
to
be
the
last
ay
her
former
spotless
reputation
what
would
people
say
the
two
returned
to
their
adolescent
period
loving
each
other
as
they
had
never
loved
before
with
the
confident
and
childish
passion
of
julio
had
leaped
from
childhood
to
libertinism
taking
his
initiation
into
life
at
a
single
bound
she
had
desired
marriage
in
order
to
acquire
the
respect
and
liberty
of
a
married
woman
but
feeling
towards
her
husband
only
a
vague
gratitude
we
end
where
others
begin
she
had
said
to
desnoyers
their
passion
took
the
form
of
an
intense
reciprocal
and
vulgar
love
they
felt
a
romantic
sentimentality
in
clasping
hands
or
exchanging
kisses
on
a
garden
bench
in
the
twilight
he
was
treasuring
a
ringlet
of
marguerite
s
although
he
doubted
its
genuineness
with
a
vague
suspicion
that
it
might
be
one
of
the
latest
wisps
of
fashion
she
would
cuddle
down
with
her
head
on
his
shoulder
as
though
imploring
his
protection
although
always
in
the
open
air
if
julio
ever
attempted
greater
intimacy
in
a
carriage
madame
would
repel
him
most
vigorously
a
contradictory
duality
appeared
to
inspire
her
actions
every
morning
on
awaking
she
would
decide
to
yield
but
then
when
near
him
her
respectability
jealous
of
its
reputation
kept
her
faithful
to
her
mother
s
teachings
one
day
she
agreed
to
visit
his
studio
with
the
interest
that
the
haunts
of
the
loved
one
always
inspires
promise
that
you
will
not
take
advantage
of
he
readily
promised
swearing
that
everything
should
be
as
marguerite
wished
but
from
that
day
they
were
no
longer
seen
in
the
gardens
nor
wandering
around
persecuted
by
the
winter
winds
they
preferred
the
studio
and
argensola
had
to
rearrange
his
existence
seeking
the
stove
of
another
artist
friend
in
order
to
continue
his
reading
this
state
of
things
lasted
two
months
they
never
knew
what
secret
force
suddenly
disturbed
their
tranquility
perhaps
one
of
her
friends
guessing
at
the
truth
had
told
the
husband
anonymously
perhaps
it
was
she
herself
unconsciously
with
her
inexpressible
happiness
her
tardy
returns
home
when
dinner
was
already
served
and
the
sudden
aversion
which
she
showed
toward
the
engineer
in
their
hours
alone
trying
to
keep
her
heart
faithful
to
her
lover
to
divide
her
interest
between
her
legal
companion
and
the
man
she
loved
was
a
torment
that
her
simple
and
vehement
enthusiasm
could
not
tolerate
while
she
was
hurrying
one
night
through
the
rue
de
la
pompe
looking
at
her
watch
and
trembling
with
impatience
at
not
finding
an
automobile
or
even
a
cab
a
man
stood
in
front
of
her
etienne
laurier
she
always
shuddered
with
fear
on
recalling
that
hour
for
a
moment
she
believed
that
he
was
going
to
kill
her
serious
men
quiet
and
diffident
are
most
terrible
in
their
explosions
of
wrath
her
husband
knew
everything
with
the
same
patience
that
he
employed
in
solving
his
industrial
problems
he
had
been
studying
her
day
by
day
without
her
ever
suspecting
the
watchfulness
behind
that
impassive
countenance
then
he
had
followed
her
in
order
to
complete
the
evidence
of
his
misfortune
marguerite
had
never
supposed
that
he
could
be
so
common
and
noisy
in
his
anger
she
had
expected
that
he
would
accept
the
facts
coldly
with
that
slight
tinge
of
philosophical
irony
usually
shown
by
distinguished
men
as
the
husbands
of
her
friends
had
done
but
the
poor
engineer
who
outside
of
his
work
saw
only
his
wife
loving
her
as
a
woman
and
adoring
her
as
a
dainty
and
superior
being
a
model
of
grace
and
elegance
could
not
endure
the
thought
of
her
downfall
and
cried
and
threatened
without
reserve
so
that
the
scandal
became
known
throughout
their
entire
circle
of
friends
the
senator
felt
greatly
annoyed
in
remembering
that
it
was
in
his
exclusive
home
that
the
guilty
ones
had
become
acquainted
but
his
displeasure
was
visited
upon
the
husband
what
lack
of
good
taste
women
will
be
women
and
everything
is
capable
of
adjustment
but
before
the
imprudent
outbursts
of
this
frantic
devil
no
elegant
solution
was
possible
and
there
was
now
nothing
to
do
but
to
begin
divorce
proceedings
desnoyers
senior
was
very
indignant
upon
learning
of
this
last
escapade
of
his
son
he
had
always
had
a
great
liking
for
laurier
that
instinctive
bond
which
exists
between
men
of
industry
patient
and
silent
had
made
them
very
congenial
at
the
senator
s
receptions
he
had
always
talked
with
the
engineer
about
the
progress
of
his
business
interesting
himself
in
the
development
of
that
factory
of
which
he
always
spoke
with
the
affection
of
a
father
the
millionaire
in
spite
of
his
reputation
for
miserliness
had
even
volunteered
his
disinterested
support
if
at
any
time
it
should
become
necessary
to
enlarge
the
plant
and
it
was
this
good
man
s
happiness
that
his
son
a
frivolous
and
useless
dancer
was
going
to
steal
at
first
laurier
spoke
of
a
duel
his
wrath
was
that
of
a
work
horse
who
breaks
the
tight
reins
of
his
laboring
outfit
tosses
his
mane
neighs
wildly
and
bites
the
father
was
greatly
distressed
at
the
possibility
of
such
an
outcome
one
scandal
more
julio
had
dedicated
the
greater
part
of
his
existence
to
the
handling
of
arms
he
will
kill
the
poor
man
he
said
to
the
senator
i
am
sure
that
he
will
kill
him
it
is
the
logic
of
life
the
always
kill
those
who
amount
to
but
there
was
no
killing
the
father
of
the
republic
knew
how
to
handle
the
clashing
parties
with
the
same
skill
that
he
always
employed
in
the
corridors
of
the
senate
during
a
ministerial
crisis
the
scandal
was
hushed
up
marguerite
went
to
live
with
her
mother
and
took
the
first
steps
for
a
divorce
some
evenings
when
the
studio
clock
was
striking
seven
she
would
yawn
and
say
sadly
i
must
go
i
have
to
go
although
this
is
my
true
home
ah
what
a
pity
that
we
are
not
married
and
he
feeling
a
whole
garden
of
bourgeois
virtues
hitherto
ignored
bursting
into
bloom
repeated
in
a
tone
of
conviction
that
s
so
why
are
we
not
married
their
wishes
could
be
realized
the
husband
was
facilitating
the
step
by
his
unexpected
intervention
so
young
desnoyers
set
forth
for
south
america
in
order
to
raise
the
money
and
marry
marguerite
chapter
iv
the
cousin
from

the
studio
of
julio
desnoyers
was
on
the
top
floor
both
the
stairway
and
the
elevator
stopping
before
his
door
the
two
tiny
apartments
at
the
back
were
lighted
by
an
interior
court
their
only
means
of
communication
being
the

went

the
garrets

was
away
argensola
had
made
the
acquaintance
of
those
in
the
neighboring
lodgings
the
largest
of
the
apartments
was
empty
during
the
day
its
occupants
not
returning
till
after
they
had
taken
their
evening
meal
in
a
restaurant
as
both
husband
and
wife
were
employed
outside
they
could
not
remain
at
home
except
on
holidays
the
man
vigorous
and
of
a
martial
aspect
was
superintendent
in
a
big
department
store
he
had
been
a
soldier
in
africa
wore
a
military
decoration
and
had
the
rank
of
in
the
reserves
she
was
a
blonde
heavy
and
rather
anaemic
with
bright
eyes
and
a
sentimental
expression
on
holidays
she
spent
long
hours
at
the
piano
playing
musical
reveries
always
the
same
at
other
times
argensola
saw
her
through
the
interior
window
working
in
the
kitchen
aided
by
her
companion
the
two
laughing
over
their
clumsiness
and
inexperience
in
preparing
the
sunday
dinner
the
concierge
thought
that
this
woman
was
a
german
but
she
herself
said
that
she
was
swiss
she
was
a
cashier
in
a
shop
not
the
one
in
which
her
husband
was
employed
in
the
mornings
they
left
home
together
separating
in
the
place
d
etoile
at
seven
in
the
evening
they
met
here
greeting
each
other
with
a
kiss
like
lovers
who
meet
for
the
first
time
and
then
after
supper
they
returned
to
their
nest
in
the
rue
de
la
pompe
all
argensola
s
attempts
at
friendliness
with
these
neighbors
were
repulsed
because
of
their
they
responded
with
freezing
courtesy
they
lived
only
for
themselves
the
other
apartment
of
two
rooms
was
occupied
by
a
single
man
he
was
a
russian
or
pole
who
almost
always
returned
with
a
package
of
books
and
passed
many
hours
writing
near
the
patio
window
from
the
very
first
the
spaniard
took
him
to
be
a
mysterious
man
probably
a
very
distinguished
one
a
true
hero
of
a
novel
the
foreign
appearance
of
this
tchernoff
made
a
great
impression
upon
him
his
dishevelled
beard
and
oily
locks
his
spectacles
upon
a
large
nose
that
seemed
deformed
by
a
there
emanated
from
him
like
an
invisible
nimbus
an
odor
of
cheap
wine
and
soiled
clothing
when
argensola
caught
a
glimpse
of
him
through
the
service
door
he
would
say
to
himself
ah
friend
tchernoff
is
returning
and
thereupon
he
would
saunter
out
to
the
stairway
in
order
to
have
a
chat
with
his
neighbor
for
a
long
time
the
stranger
discouraged
all
approach
to
his
quarters
which
fact
led
the
spaniard
to
infer
that
he
devoted
himself
to
alchemy
and
kindred
mysteries
when
he
finally
was
allowed
to
enter
he
saw
only
books
many
books
books
everywhere
scattered
on
the
floor
heaped
upon
benches
piled
in
corners
overflowing
on
to
chairs
old
tables
and
a
bed
that
was
only
made
up
now
and
then
when
the
owner
alarmed
by
the
increasing
invasion
of
dust
and
cobwebs
was
obliged
to
call
in
the
aid
of
his
friend
the
concierge
argensola
finally
realized
not
without
a
certain
disenchantment
that
there
was
nothing
mysterious
in
the
life
of
the
man
what
he
was
writing
near
the
window
were
merely
translations
some
of
them
ordered
others
volunteer
work
for
the
socialist
periodicals
the
only
marvellous
thing
about
him
was
the
quantity
of
languages
that
he
knew
he
knows
them
all
said
the
spaniard
when
describing
their
neighbor
to
desnoyers
he
has
only
to
hear
of
a
new
one
to
master
it
he
holds
the
key
the
secret
of
all
languages
living
or
dead
he
speaks
castilian
as
well
as
we
do
and
yet
he
has
never
been
in
a
argensola
again
felt
a
thrill
of
mystery
upon
reading
the
titles
of
many
of
the
volumes
the
majority
were
old
books
many
of
them
in
languages
that
he
was
not
able
to
decipher
picked
up
for
a
song
at
shops
or
on
the
book
stands
installed
upon
the
parapets
of
the
seine
only
a
man
holding
the
key
of
tongues
could
get
together
such
volumes
an
atmosphere
of
mysticism
of
superhuman
insight
of
secrets
intact
for
many
centuries
appeared
to
emanate
from
these
heaps
of
dusty
volumes
with
leaves
and
mixed
with
these
ancient
tomes
were
others
red
and
conspicuous
pamphlets
of
socialistic
propaganda
leaflets
in
all
the
languages
of
europe
and
periodicals
many
periodicals
with
revolutionary
titles
tchernoff
did
not
appear
to
enjoy
visits
and
conversation
he
would
smile
enigmatically
into
his
black
beard
and
was
very
sparing
with
his
words
so
as
to
shorten
the
interview
but
argensola
possessed
the
means
of
winning
over
this
sullen
personage
it
was
only
necessary
for
him
to
wink
one
eye
with
the
expressive
invitation
do
we
go
and
the
two
would
soon
be
settled
on
a
bench
in
the
kitchen
of
desnoyers
studio
opposite
a
bottle
which
had
come
from
the
avenue
victor
hugo
the
costly
wines
of
don
marcelo
made
the
russian
more
communicative
although
in
spite
of
this
aid
the
spaniard
learned
little
of
his
neighbor
s
real
existence
sometimes
he
would
mention
jaures
and
other
socialistic
orators
his
surest
means
of
existence
was
the
translation
of
periodicals
or
party
papers
on
various
occasions
the
name
of
siberia
escaped
from
his
lips
and
he
admitted
that
he
had
been
there
a
long
time
but
he
did
not
care
to
talk
about
a
country
visited
against
his
will
he
would
merely
smile
modestly
showing
plainly
that
he
did
not
wish
to
make
any
further
revelations
the
morning
after
the
return
of
julio
desnoyers
while
argensola
was
talking
on
the
stairway
with
tchernoff
the
bell
rang
how
annoying
the
russian
who
was
well
up
in
advanced
politics
was
just
explaining
the
plans
advanced
by
jaures
there
were
still
many
who
hoped
that
war
might
be
averted
he
had
his
motives
for
doubting
it
he
tchernoff
was
commenting
on
these
illusions
with
the
smile
of
a
sphinx
when
the
bell
rang
for
a
second
time
so
that
argensola
was
obliged
to
break
away
from
his
interesting
friend
and
run
to
open
the
main
door
a
gentleman
wished
to
see
julio
he
spoke
very
correct
french
though
his
accent
was
a
revelation
for
argensola
upon
going
into
the
bedroom
in
search
of
his
master
who
was
just
arising
he
said
confidently
it
s
the
cousin
from
berlin
who
has
come
to
say
it
could
not
be
anyone
when
the
three
came
together
in
the
studio
desnoyers
presented
his
comrade
in
order
that
the
visitor
might
not
make
any
mistake
in
regard
to
his
social
status
i
have
heard
him
spoken
of
the
gentleman
is
argensola
a
very
deserving
doctor
julius
von
hartrott
said
this
with
the
of
a
man
who
knows
everything
and
wishes
to
be
agreeable
to
an
inferior
conceding
him
the
alms
of
his
attention
the
two
cousins
confronted
each
other
with
a
curiosity
not
altogether
free
from
distrust
although
closely
related
they
knew
each
other
very
slightly
tacitly
admitting
complete
divergence
in
opinions
and
tastes
after
slowly
examining
the
sage
argensola
came
to
the
conclusion
that
he
looked
like
an
officer
dressed
as
a
civilian
he
noticed
in
his
person
an
effort
to
imitate
the
soldierly
when
occasionally
discarding
uniform
the
ambition
of
every
german
burgher
wishing
to
be
taken
for
the
superior
class
his
trousers
were
narrow
as
though
intended
to
be
tucked
into
cavalry
boots
his
coat
with
two
rows
of
buttons
had
the
contracted
waist
with
very
full
skirt
and
upstanding
lapels
suggesting
vaguely
a
military
great
coat
the
reddish
moustachios
strong
jaw
and
shaved
head
completed
his
martial
appearance
but
his
eyes
large
and
were
the
eyes
of
a
student
taking
refuge
behind
great
thick
glasses
which
gave
him
the
aspect
of
a
man
of
peace
desnoyers
knew
that
he
was
an
assistant
professor
of
the
university
that
he
had
published
a
few
volumes
fat
and
heavy
as
bricks
and
that
he
was
a
member
of
an
academic
society
collaborating
in
documentary
research
directed
by
a
famous
historian
in
his
lapel
he
was
wearing
the
badge
of
a
foreign
order
julio
s
respect
for
the
learned
member
of
the
family
was
not
unmixed
with
contempt
he
and
his
sister
chichi
had
from
childhood
felt
an
instinctive
hostility
toward
the
cousins
from
berlin
it
annoyed
him
too
to
have
his
family
everlastingly
holding
up
as
a
model
this
pedant
who
only
knew
life
as
it
is
in
books
and
passed
his
existence
investigating
what
men
had
done
in
other
epochs
in
order
to
draw
conclusions
in
harmony
with
germany
s
views
while
young
desnoyers
had
great
facility
for
admiration
and
reverenced
all
those
whose
arguments
argensola
had
doled
out
to
him
he
drew
the
line
at
accepting
the
intellectual
grandeur
of
this
illustrious
relative
during
his
stay
in
berlin
a
german
word
of
vulgar
invention
had
enabled
him
to
classify
this
prig
heavy
books
of
minute
investigation
were
every
month
being
published
by
the
dozens
in
the
fatherland
there
was
not
a
professor
who
could
resist
the
temptation
of
constructing
from
the
simplest
detail
an
enormous
volume
written
in
a
dull
involved
style
the
people
therefore
appreciating
that
these
authors
were
incapable
of
any
genial
vision
of
comradeship
called
them
sitzfleisch
haben
because
of
the
very
long
sittings
which
their
works
represented
that
was
what
this
cousin
was
for
him
a
mere
sitzfleisch
haben
doctor
von
hartrott
on
explaining
his
visit
spoke
in
spanish
he
availed
himself
of
this
language
used
by
the
family
during
his
childhood
as
a
precaution
looking
around
repeatedly
as
if
he
feared
to
be
heard
he
had
come
to
bid
his
cousin
farewell
his
mother
had
told
him
of
his
return
and
he
had
not
wished
to
leave
paris
without
seeing
him
he
was
leaving
in
a
few
hours
since
matters
were
growing
more
strained
but
do
you
really
believe
that
there
will
be
war
asked
desnoyers
war
will
be
declared
or
the
day
after
nothing
can
prevent
it
now
it
is
necessary
for
the
welfare
of
silence
followed
this
speech
julio
and
argensola
looking
with
astonishment
at
this
man
who
had
just
spoken
with
such
martial
arrogance
the
two
suspected
that
the
professor
was
making
this
visit
in
order
to
give
vent
to
his
opinions
and
enthusiasms
at
the
same
time
perhaps
he
was
trying
to
find
out
what
they
might
think
and
know
as
one
of
the
many
viewpoints
of
the
people
in
paris
you
are
not
french
he
added
looking
at
his
cousin
you
were
born
in
argentina
so
before
you
i
may
speak
the
and
were
you
not
born
there
asked
julio
smiling
the
doctor
made
a
gesture
of
protest
as
though
he
had
just
heard
something
insulting
no
i
am
a
german
no
matter
where
a
german
may
be
born
he
always
belongs
to
his
mother
then
turning
to
argensola
this
gentleman
too
is
a
foreigner
he
comes
from
noble
spain
which
owes
to
us
the
best
that
it
has
the
worship
of
honor
the
knightly
the
spaniard
wished
to
remonstrate
but
the
sage
would
not
permit
adding
in
an
oracular
tone
you
were
miserable
celts
sunk
in
the
vileness
of
an
inferior
and
mongrel
race
whose
domination
by
rome
but
made
your
situation
worse
fortunately
you
were
conquered
by
the
goths
and
others
of
our
race
who
implanted
in
you
a
sense
of
personal
dignity
do
not
forget
young
man
that
the
vandals
were
the
ancestors
of
the
prussians
of
again
argensola
tried
to
speak
but
his
friend
signed
to
him
not
to
interrupt
the
professor
who
appeared
to
have
forgotten
his
former
reserve
and
was
working
up
to
an
enthusiastic
pitch
with
his
own
words
we
are
going
to
witness
great
events
he
continued
fortunate
are
those
born
in
this
epoch
the
most
interesting
in
history
at
this
very
moment
humanity
is
changing
its
course
now
the
true
civilization
the
war
according
to
him
was
going
to
be
of
a
brevity
hitherto
unseen
germany
had
been
preparing
herself
to
bring
about
this
event
without
any
long
economic
a
single
month
would
be
enough
to
crush
france
the
most
to
be
feared
of
their
adversaries
then
they
would
march
against
russia
who
with
her
slow
clumsy
movements
could
not
oppose
an
immediate
defense
finally
they
would
attack
haughty
england
so
isolated
in
its
archipelago
that
it
could
not
obstruct
the
sweep
of
german
progress
this
would
make
a
series
of
rapid
blows
and
overwhelming
victories
requiring
only
a
summer
in
which
to
play
this
magnificent
role
the
fall
of
the
leaves
in
the
following
autumn
would
greet
the
definite
triumph
of
germany
with
the
assurance
of
a
professor
who
does
not
expect
his
dictum
to
be
refuted
by
his
hearers
he
explained
the
superiority
of
the
german
race
all
mankind
was
divided
into
two
groups
dolicephalous
and
the
brachicephalous
according
to
the
shape
of
the
skull
another
scientific
classification
divided
men
into
the
and
the
dolicephalous
arched
heads
represented
purity
of
race
and
superior
mentality
the
brachicephalous
flat
heads
were
mongrels
with
all
the
stigma
of
degeneration
the
german
dolicephalous
par
excellence
was
the
only
descendant
of
the
primitive
aryans
all
the
other
nations
especially
those
of
the
south
of
europe
called
latins
belonged
to
a
degenerate
humanity
the
spaniard
could
not
contain
himself
any
longer
but
no
person
with
any
intelligence
believes
any
more
in
those
antique
theories
of
race
what
if
there
no
longer
existed
a
people
of
absolutely
pure
blood
owing
to
thousands
of
admixtures
due
to
historical
conquests
many
germans
bore
the
identical
ethnic
marks
which
the
professor
was
attributing
to
the
inferior
races
there
is
something
in
that
admitted
hartrott
but
although
the
german
race
may
not
be
perfectly
pure
it
is
the
least
impure
of
all
races
and
therefore
should
have
dominion
over
the
his
voice
took
on
an
ironic
and
cutting
edge
when
speaking
of
the
celts
inhabitants
of
the
lands
of
the
south
they
had
retarded
the
progress
of
humanity
deflecting
it
in
the
wrong
direction
the
celt
is
individualistic
and
consequently
an
ungovernable
revolutionary
who
tends
to
socialism
furthermore
he
is
a
humanitarian
and
makes
a
virtue
of
mercy
defending
the
existence
of
the
weak
who
do
not
amount
to
anything
the
illustrious
german
places
above
everything
else
method
and
power
elected
by
nature
to
command
the
impotent
races
he
possesses
all
the
qualifications
that
distinguish
the
superior
leader
the
french
revolution
was
merely
a
clash
between
teutons
and
celts
the
nobility
of
france
were
descended
from
germanic
warriors
established
in
the
country
after
the
invasion
of
the
barbarians
the
middle
and
lower
classes
were
the
element
the
inferior
race
had
conquered
the
superior
disorganizing
the
country
and
perturbing
the
world
celtism
was
the
inventor
of
democracy
of
the
doctrines
of
socialism
and
anarchy
now
the
hour
of
germanic
retaliation
was
about
to
strike
and
the
northern
race
would
order
since
god
had
favored
it
by
demonstrating
its
indisputable
superiority
a
nation
he
added
can
aspire
to
great
destinies
only
when
it
is
fundamentally
teutonic
the
less
german
it
is
the
less
its
civilization
amounts
to
we
represent
the
aristocracy
of
humanity
the
salt
of
the
earth
as
our
william
argensola
was
listening
with
astonishment
to
this
outpouring
of
conceit
all
the
great
nations
had
passed
through
the
fever
of
imperialism
the
greeks
aspired
to
because
they
were
the
most
civilized
and
believed
themselves
the
most
fit
to
give
civilization
to
the
rest
of
mankind
the
romans
upon
conquering
countries
implanted
law
and
the
rule
of
justice
the
french
of
the
revolution
and
the
empire
justified
their
invasions
on
the
plea
that
they
wished
to
liberate
mankind
and
spread
abroad
new
ideas
even
the
spaniards
of
the
sixteenth
century
when
battling
with
half
of
europe
for
religious
unity
and
the
extermination
of
heresy
were
working
toward
their
ideals
obscure
and
perhaps
erroneous
but
disinterested
all
the
nations
of
history
had
been
struggling
for
something
which
they
had
considered
generous
and
above
their
own
interests
germany
alone
according
to
this
professor
was
trying
to
impose
itself
upon
the
world
in
the
name
of
racial
superiority
a
superiority
that
nobody
had
recognized
that
she
was
arrogating
to
herself
coating
her
affirmations
with
a
varnish
of
false
science
until
now
wars
have
been
carried
on
by
the
soldiery
continued
hartrott
that
which
is
now
going
to
begin
will
be
waged
by
a
combination
of
soldiers
and
professors
in
its
preparation
the
university
has
taken
as
much
part
as
the
military
staff
german
science
leader
of
all
sciences
is
united
forever
with
what
the
latin
revolutionists
disdainfully
term
militarism
force
mistress
of
the
world
is
what
creates
right
that
which
our
truly
unique
civilization
imposes
our
armies
are
the
representatives
of
our
culture
and
in
a
few
weeks
we
shall
free
the
world
from
its
decadence
completely
rejuvenating
the
vision
of
the
immense
future
of
his
race
was
leading
him
on
to
expose
himself
with
lyrical
enthusiasm
william
i
bismarck
all
the
heroes
of
past
victories
inspired
his
veneration
but
he
spoke
of
them
as
dying
gods
whose
hour
had
passed
they
were
glorious
ancestors
of
modest
pretensions
who
had
confined
their
activities
to
enlarging
the
frontiers
and
to
establishing
the
unity
of
the
empire
afterwards
opposing
themselves
with
the
prudence
of
valetudinarians
to
the
daring
of
the
new
generation
their
ambitions
went
no
further
than
a
continental
hegemony
but
now
william
ii
had
leaped
into
the
arena
the
complex
hero
that
the
country
required
lamprecht
my
master
has
pictured
his
greatness
it
is
tradition
and
the
future
method
and
audacity
like
his
grandfather
the
emperor
holds
the
conviction
of
what
monarchy
by
the
grace
of
god
represents
but
his
vivid
and
modern
intelligence
recognizes
and
accepts
modern
conditions
at
the
same
time
that
he
is
romantic
feudal
and
a
supporter
of
the
agrarian
conservatives
he
is
also
an
man
who
seeks
practical
solutions
and
shows
a
utilitarian
spirit
in
him
are
correctly
balanced
instinct
and
germany
guided
by
this
hero
had
according
to
hartrott
been
concentrating
its
strength
and
recognizing
its
true
path
the
universities
supported
him
even
more
unanimously
than
the
army
why
store
up
so
much
power
and
maintain
it
without
employment
the
empire
of
the
world
belongs
to
the
german
people
the
historians
and
philosophers
disciples
of
treitschke
were
taking
it
upon
themselves
to
frame
the
rights
that
would
justify
this
universal
domination
and
lamprecht
the
psychological
historian
like
the
other
professors
was
launching
the
belief
in
the
absolute
superiority
of
the
germanic
race
it
was
just
that
it
should
rule
the
world
since
it
only
had
the
power
to
do
so
this
telurian
germanization
was
to
be
of
immense
benefit
to
mankind
the
earth
was
going
to
be
happy
under
the
dictatorship
of
a
people
born
for
mastery
the
german
state
tentacular
potency
would
eclipse
with
its
glory
the
most
imposing
empire
of
the
past
and
present
gott
mit
uns
who
will
be
able
to
deny
as
my
master
says
that
there
exists
a
christian
german
god
the
great
ally
who
is
showing
himself
to
our
enemies
the
foreigners
as
a
strong
and
jealous
divinity
desnoyers
was
listening
to
his
cousin
with
astonishment
and
at
the
same
time
looking
at
argensola
who
with
a
flutter
of
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
saying
to
him
he
is
mad
these
germans
are
simply
mad
with
meanwhile
the
professor
unable
to
curb
his
enthusiasm
continued
expounding
the
grandeur
of
his
race
from
his
viewpoint
the
providential
kaiser
had
shown
inexplicable
weakenings
he
was
too
good
and
too
kind
deliciae
generis
humani
as
had
said
professor
lasson
another
of
hartrott
s
masters
able
to
overthrow
everything
with
his
annihilating
power
the
emperor
was
limiting
himself
merely
to
maintaining
peace
but
the
nation
did
not
wish
to
stop
there
and
was
pushing
its
leader
until
it
had
him
started
it
was
useless
now
to
put
on
the
brakes
he
who
does
not
advance
recedes
that
was
the
cry
of
pangermanism
to
the
emperor
he
must
press
on
in
order
to
conquer
the
entire
world
and
now
war
comes
continued
the
pedant
we
need
the
colonies
of
the
others
even
though
bismarck
through
an
error
of
his
stubborn
old
age
exacted
nothing
at
the
time
of
universal
distribution
letting
england
and
france
get
possession
of
the
best
lands
we
must
control
all
countries
that
have
germanic
blood
and
have
been
civilized
by
our
hartrott
enumerated
these
countries
holland
and
belgium
were
german
france
through
the
franks
was
teutonic
blood
italy
here
the
professor
hesitated
recalling
the
fact
that
this
nation
was
still
an
ally
certainly
a
little
insecure
but
still
united
by
diplomatic
bonds
he
mentioned
nevertheless
the
longobards
and
other
races
coming
from
the
north
spain
and
portugal
had
been
populated
by
the
ruddy
goth
and
also
belonged
to
the
dominant
race
and
since
the
majority
of
the
nations
of
america
were
of
spanish
and
portuguese
origin
they
should
also
be
included
in
this
recovery
it
is
a
little
premature
to
think
of
these
last
nations
just
yet
added
the
doctor
modestly
but
some
day
the
hour
of
justice
will
sound
after
our
continental
triumph
we
shall
have
time
to
think
of
their
fate
north
america
also
should
receive
our
civilizing
influence
for
there
are
living
millions
of
germans
who
have
created
its
he
was
talking
of
the
future
conquests
as
though
they
were
marks
of
distinction
with
which
his
country
was
going
to
favor
other
countries
these
were
to
continue
living
politically
the
same
as
before
with
their
individual
governments
but
subject
to
the
teutons
like
minors
requiring
the
strong
hand
of
a
master
they
would
form
the
universal
united
states
with
an
hereditary
and
president
the
emperor
of
germany
receiving
all
the
benefits
of
germanic
culture
working
disciplined
under
his
industrial
direction
but
the
world
is
ungrateful
and
human
badness
always
opposes
itself
to
progress
we
have
no
illusions
sighed
the
professor
with
lofty
sadness
we
have
no
friends
all
look
upon
us
with
jealousy
as
dangerous
beings
because
we
are
the
most
intelligent
the
most
active
and
have
proved
ourselves
superior
to
all
others
but
since
they
no
longer
love
us
let
them
fear
us
as
my
friend
mann
says
although
kultur
is
the
spiritual
organization
of
the
world
it
does
not
exclude
bloody
savagery
when
that
becomes
necessary
kultur
sanctifies
the
demon
within
us
and
is
above
morality
reason
and
science
we
are
going
to
impose
kultur
by
force
of
the
argensola
continued
saying
with
his
eyes
they
are
crazy
crazy
with
pride
what
can
the
world
expect
of
such
people
desnoyers
here
intervened
in
order
to
brighten
this
gloomy
monologue
with
a
little
optimism
war
had
not
yet
been
positively
declared
the
diplomats
were
still
trying
to
arrange
matters
perhaps
it
might
all
turn
out
peaceably
at
the
last
minute
as
had
so
often
happened
before
his
cousin
was
seeing
things
entirely
distorted
by
an
aggressive
enthusiasm
oh
the
ironical
ferocious
and
cutting
smile
of
the
doctor
argensola
had
never
known
old
madariaga
but
it
nevertheless
occurred
to
him
that
in
this
fashion
sharks
must
smile
although
he
too
had
never
seen
a
shark
it
is
war
boomed
hartrott
when
i
left
germany
fifteen
days
ago
i
knew
that
war
was
the
certainty
with
which
he
said
this
dissipated
all
julio
s
hope
moreover
this
man
s
trip
on
the
pretext
of
seeing
his
mother
disquieted
him
on
what
mission
had
doctor
julius
von
hartrott
come
to
paris
well
then
asked
desnoyers
why
so
many
diplomatic
interviews
why
does
the
german
government
intervene
at
all
although
in
such
a
lukewarm
way
in
the
struggle
between
austria
and
servia
would
it
not
be
better
to
declare
war
right
out
the
professor
replied
with
simplicity
our
government
undoubtedly
wishes
that
the
others
should
declare
the
war
the
role
of
outraged
dignity
is
always
the
most
pleasing
one
and
justifies
all
ulterior
resolutions
however
extreme
they
may
seem
there
are
some
of
our
people
who
are
living
comfortably
and
do
not
desire
war
it
is
expedient
to
make
them
believe
that
those
who
impose
it
upon
us
are
our
enemies
so
that
they
may
feel
the
necessity
of
defending
themselves
only
superior
minds
reach
the
conviction
of
the
great
advancement
that
can
be
accomplished
by
the
sword
alone
and
that
war
as
our
grand
treitschke
says
is
the
highest
form
of
again
he
smiled
with
a
ferocious
expression
morality
from
his
point
of
view
should
exist
among
individuals
only
to
make
them
more
obedient
and
disciplined
for
morality
per
se
impedes
governments
and
should
be
suppressed
as
a
useless
obstacle
for
the
state
there
exists
neither
truth
nor
falsehood
it
only
recognizes
the
utility
of
things
the
glorious
bismarck
in
order
to
consummate
the
war
with
france
the
base
of
german
grandeur
had
not
hesitated
to
falsify
a
telegraphic
despatch
and
remember
that
he
is
the
most
glorious
hero
of
our
time
history
looks
leniently
upon
his
heroic
feat
who
would
accuse
the
one
who
triumphs
professor
hans
delbruck
has
written
with
reason
blessed
be
the
hand
that
falsified
the
telegram
of
ems
it
was
convenient
to
have
the
war
break
out
immediately
in
order
that
events
might
result
favorably
for
germany
whose
enemies
are
totally
unprepared
preventive
war
was
recommended
by
general
bernhardi
and
other
illustrious
patriots
it
would
be
dangerous
indeed
to
defer
the
declaration
of
war
until
the
enemies
had
fortified
themselves
so
that
they
should
be
the
ones
to
make
war
besides
to
the
germans
what
kind
of
deterrents
could
law
and
other
fictions
invented
by
weak
nations
possibly
be
no
they
had
the
power
and
power
creates
new
laws
if
they
proved
to
be
the
victors
history
would
not
investigate
too
closely
the
means
by
which
they
had
conquered
it
was
germany
that
was
going
to
win
and
the
priests
of
all
cults
would
finally
sanctify
with
their
chants
the
blessed
war
if
it
led
to
triumph
we
are
not
making
war
in
order
to
punish
the
servian
regicides
nor
to
free
the
poles
nor
the
others
oppressed
by
russia
stopping
there
in
admiration
of
our
disinterested
magnanimity
we
wish
to
wage
it
because
we
are
the
first
people
of
the
earth
and
should
extend
our
activity
over
the
entire
planet
germany
s
hour
has
sounded
we
are
going
to
take
our
place
as
the
powerful
mistress
of
the
world
the
place
which
spain
occupied
in
former
centuries
afterwards
france
and
england
what
those
people
accomplished
in
a
struggle
of
many
years
we
are
going
to
bring
about
in
four
months
the
of
the
empire
is
now
going
to
wave
over
nations
and
oceans
the
sun
is
going
to
shine
on
a
great
slaughter
old
rome
sick
unto
death
called
barbarians
the
germans
who
opened
the
grave
the
world
also
smells
death
and
will
surely
call
us
barbarians
so
be
it
when
tangiers
and
toulouse
amberes
and
calais
have
become
submissive
to
german
barbarism
then
we
will
speak
further
of
this
matter
we
have
the
power
and
who
has
that
needs
neither
to
hesitate
nor
to
argue
power
that
is
the
beautiful
word
the
only
word
that
rings
true
and
clear
power
one
sure
stab
and
all
argument
is
answered
forever
but
are
you
so
sure
of
victory
asked
desnoyers
sometimes
destiny
gives
us
great
surprises
there
are
hidden
forces
that
we
must
take
into
consideration
or
they
may
overturn
the
the
smile
of
the
doctor
became
increasingly
scornful
and
arrogant
everything
had
been
foreseen
and
studied
out
long
ago
with
the
most
minute
germanic
method
what
had
they
to
fear
the
enemy
most
to
be
reckoned
with
was
france
incapable
of
resisting
the
enervating
moral
influences
the
sufferings
the
strain
and
the
privations
of
war
a
nation
physically
debilitated
and
so
poisoned
by
revolutionary
spirit
that
it
had
laid
aside
the
use
of
arms
through
an
exaggerated
love
of
comfort
our
generals
he
announced
are
going
to
leave
her
in
such
a
state
that
she
will
never
again
cross
our
there
was
russia
too
to
consider
but
her
amorphous
masses
were
slow
to
assemble
and
unwieldy
to
move
the
executive
staff
of
berlin
had
timed
everything
by
measure
for
crushing
france
in
four
weeks
and
would
then
lead
its
enormous
forces
against
the
russian
empire
before
it
could
begin
action
we
shall
finish
with
the
bear
after
killing
the
cock
affirmed
the
professor
triumphantly
but
guessing
at
some
objection
from
his
cousin
he
hastened
on
i
know
what
you
are
going
to
tell
me
there
remains
another
enemy
one
that
has
not
yet
leaped
into
the
lists
but
which
all
the
germans
are
waiting
for
that
one
inspires
more
hatred
than
all
the
others
put
together
because
it
is
of
our
blood
because
it
is
a
traitor
to
the
race
ah
how
we
loathe
it
and
in
the
tone
in
which
these
words
were
uttered
throbbed
an
expression
of
hatred
and
a
thirst
for
vengeance
which
astonished
both
listeners
even
though
england
attack
us
continued
hartrott
we
shall
conquer
notwithstanding
this
adversary
is
not
more
terrible
than
the
others
for
the
past
century
she
has
ruled
the
world
upon
the
fall
of
napoleon
she
seized
the
continental
hegemony
and
will
fight
to
keep
it
but
what
does
her
energy
amount
to
as
our
bernhardi
says
the
english
people
are
merely
a
nation
of
renters
and
sportsmen
their
army
is
formed
from
the
dregs
of
the
nation
the
country
lacks
military
spirit
we
are
a
people
of
warriors
and
it
will
be
an
easy
thing
for
us
to
conquer
the
english
debilitated
by
a
false
conception
of
the
doctor
paused
and
then
added
we
are
counting
on
the
internal
corruption
of
our
enemies
on
their
lack
of
unity
god
will
aid
us
by
sowing
confusion
among
these
detested
people
in
a
few
days
you
will
see
his
hand
revolution
is
going
to
break
out
in
france
at
the
same
time
as
war
the
people
of
paris
will
build
barricades
in
the
streets
and
the
scenes
of
the
commune
will
repeat
themselves
tunis
algiers
and
all
their
other
possessions
are
about
to
rise
against
the
argensola
seized
the
opportunity
to
smile
with
an
aggressive
incredulity
i
repeat
it
insisted
hartrott
that
this
country
is
going
to
have
internal
revolution
and
colonial
insurrection
i
know
perfectly
well
what
i
am
talking
about
russia
also
will
break
out
into
revolution
with
a
red
flag
that
will
force
the
czar
to
beg
for
mercy
on
his
knees
you
have
only
to
read
in
the
papers
of
the
recent
strikes
in
saint
petersburg
and
the
manifestations
of
the
strikers
with
the
pretext
of
president
poincare
s
visit
england
will
see
her
appeals
to
her
colonies
completely
ignored
india
is
going
to
rise
against
her
and
egypt
too
will
seize
this
opportunity
for
her
julio
was
beginning
to
be
impressed
by
these
affirmations
enunciated
with
such
oracular
certainty
and
he
felt
almost
irritated
at
the
incredulous
argensola
who
continued
looking
insolently
at
the
seer
repeating
with
his
winking
eyes
he
is
insane
insane
with
the
man
certainly
must
have
strong
reasons
for
making
such
awful
prophecies
his
presence
in
paris
just
at
this
time
was
difficult
for
desnoyers
to
understand
and
gave
to
his
words
a
mysterious
authority
but
the
nations
will
defend
themselves
he
protested
to
his
cousin
victory
will
not
be
such
a
very
simple
thing
as
you
yes
they
will
defend
themselves
and
the
struggle
will
be
fiercely
contested
it
appears
that
of
late
years
france
has
been
paying
some
attention
to
her
army
we
shall
undoubtedly
encounter
some
resistance
triumph
may
be
somewhat
difficult
but
we
are
going
to
prevail
you
have
no
idea
to
what
extent
the
offensive
power
of
germany
has
attained
nobody
knows
with
certainty
beyond
the
frontiers
if
our
foes
should
comprehend
it
in
all
its
immensity
they
would
fall
on
their
knees
beforehand
to
beg
for
mercy
thus
obviating
the
necessity
for
useless
there
was
a
long
silence
julius
von
hartrott
appeared
lost
in
reverie
the
very
thought
of
the
accumulated
strength
of
his
race
submerged
him
in
a
species
of
mystic
adoration
the
preliminary
victory
he
suddenly
exclaimed
we
gained
some
time
ago
our
enemies
therefore
hate
us
and
yet
they
imitate
us
all
that
bears
the
stamp
of
germany
is
in
demand
throughout
the
world
the
very
countries
that
are
trying
to
resist
our
arms
copy
our
methods
in
their
universities
and
admire
our
theories
even
those
which
do
not
attain
success
in
germany
oftentimes
we
laugh
among
ourselves
like
the
roman
augurs
upon
seeing
the
servility
with
which
they
follow
us
and
yet
they
will
not
admit
our
superiority
for
the
first
time
argensola
s
eyes
and
general
expression
approved
the
words
of
hartrott
what
he
had
just
said
was
only
too
true
the
world
was
a
victim
of
the
german
an
intellectual
cowardice
the
fear
of
force
had
made
it
admire
en
masse
and
indiscriminately
everything
of
teutonic
origin
just
because
of
the
intensity
of
its
glitter
gold
mixed
with
talcum
the
latins
dazed
with
admiration
were
with
unreasonable
pessimism
becoming
doubtful
of
their
ability
and
thus
were
the
first
to
decree
their
own
death
and
the
conceited
germans
merely
had
to
repeat
the
words
of
these
pessimists
in
order
to
strengthen
their
belief
in
their
own
superiority
with
that
southern
temperament
which
leaps
rapidly
from
one
extreme
to
another
many
latins
had
proclaimed
that
in
the
world
of
the
future
there
would
be
no
place
for
the
latin
peoples
now
in
their
adding
that
germany
alone
preserved
the
latent
forces
of
civilization
the
french
who
declaimed
among
themselves
with
the
greatest
exaggeration
unconscious
that
folks
were
listening
the
other
side
of
the
door
had
proclaimed
repeatedly
for
many
years
past
that
france
was
degenerating
rapidly
and
would
soon
vanish
from
the
earth
then
why
should
they
resent
the
scorn
of
their
enemies
why
shouldn
t
the
germans
share
in
their
beliefs
the
professor
misinterpreting
the
silent
agreement
of
the
spaniard
who
until
then
had
been
listening
with
such
a
hostile
smile
added
now
is
the
time
to
try
out
in
france
the
german
culture
implanting
it
there
as
here
argensola
interrupted
and
what
if
there
is
no
such
thing
as
german
culture
as
a
celebrated
teuton
says
it
had
become
necessary
to
contradict
this
pedant
who
had
become
insufferable
with
his
egotism
hartrott
almost
jumped
from
his
chair
on
hearing
such
a
doubt
what
german
is
that
the
professor
looked
at
him
pityingly
nietzsche
had
said
to
mankind
be
harsh
affirming
that
a
righteous
war
sanctifies
every
he
had
exalted
bismarck
he
had
taken
part
in
the
war
of
he
was
glorifying
germany
when
he
spoke
of
the
smiling
lion
and
the
blond
but
argensola
listened
with
the
tranquillity
of
one
sure
of
his
ground
oh
hours
of
placid
reading
near
the
studio
chimney
listening
to
the
rain
beating
against
the
pane
the
philosopher
did
say
that
he
admitted
and
he
said
many
other
very
different
things
like
all
great
thinkers
his
doctrine
is
one
of
pride
but
of
individual
pride
not
that
of
a
nation
or
race
he
always
spoke
against
the
insidious
fallacy
of
argensola
recalled
his
philosophy
word
for
word
culture
according
to
nietzsche
was
unity
of
style
in
all
the
manifestations
of
science
did
not
necessarily
include
culture
great
knowledge
might
be
accompanied
with
great
barbarity
by
the
absence
of
style
or
by
the
chaotic
confusion
of
all
styles
germany
according
to
the
philosopher
had
no
genuine
culture
owing
to
its
lack
of
style
the
french
he
had
said
were
at
the
head
of
an
authentic
and
fruitful
culture
whatever
their
valor
might
be
and
until
now
everybody
had
drawn
upon
their
hatreds
were
concentrated
within
their
own
country
i
can
not
endure
germany
the
spirit
of
servility
and
pettiness
penetrates
everywhere
i
believe
only
in
french
culture
and
what
the
rest
of
europe
calls
culture
appears
to
me
to
be
a
mistake
the
few
individual
cases
of
lofty
culture
that
i
met
in
germany
were
of
french
you
know
continued
argensola
that
in
quarrelling
with
wagner
about
the
excess
of
germanism
in
his
art
nietzsche
proclaimed
the
necessity
of
mediterraneanizing
music
his
ideal
was
a
culture
for
all
europe
but
with
a
latin
julius
von
hartrott
replied
most
disdainfully
to
this
repeating
the
spaniard
s
very
words
men
who
thought
much
said
many
things
besides
nietzsche
was
a
poet
completely
demented
at
his
death
and
was
no
authority
among
the
university
sages
his
fame
had
only
been
recognized
in
foreign
lands
and
he
paid
no
further
attention
to
the
youth
ignoring
him
as
though
he
had
evaporated
into
thin
air
after
his
presumption
all
the
professor
s
attention
was
now
concentrated
on
desnoyers
this
country
he
resumed
is
dying
from
within
how
can
you
doubt
that
revolution
will
break
out
the
minute
war
is
declared
have
you
not
noticed
the
agitation
of
the
boulevard
on
account
of
the
caillaux
trial
reactionaries
and
revolutionists
have
been
assaulting
each
other
for
the
past
three
days
i
have
seen
them
challenging
one
another
with
shouts
and
songs
as
if
they
were
going
to
come
to
blows
right
in
the
middle
of
the
street
this
division
of
opinion
will
become
accentuated
when
our
troops
cross
the
frontier
it
will
then
be
civil
war
the
are
clamoring
mournfully
believing
that
it
is
in
the
power
of
the
government
to
prevent
the
clash
a
country
degenerated
by
democracy
and
by
the
inferiority
of
the
triumphant
celt
greedy
for
full
liberty
we
are
the
only
free
people
on
earth
because
we
know
how
to
this
paradox
made
julio
smile
germany
the
only
free
people
it
is
so
persisted
hartrott
energetically
we
have
the
liberty
best
suited
to
a
great
people
economical
and
intellectual
and
political
liberty
the
professor
received
this
question
with
a
scornful
shrug
political
liberty
only
decadent
and
ungovernable
people
inferior
races
anxious
for
equality
and
democratic
confusion
talk
about
political
liberty
we
germans
do
not
need
it
we
are
a
nation
of
masters
who
recognize
the
sacredness
of
government
and
we
wish
to
be
commanded
by
those
of
superior
birth
we
possess
the
genius
of
that
according
to
the
doctor
was
the
grand
german
secret
and
the
teutonic
race
upon
taking
possession
of
the
world
would
share
its
discovery
with
all
the
nations
would
then
be
so
organized
that
each
individual
would
give
the
maximum
of
service
to
society
humanity
banded
in
regiments
for
every
class
of
production
obeying
a
superior
officer
like
machines
contributing
the
greatest
possible
output
of
labor
there
you
have
the
perfect
state
liberty
was
a
purely
negative
idea
if
not
accompanied
with
a
positive
concept
which
would
make
it
useful
the
two
friends
listened
with
astonishment
to
this
description
of
the
future
which
teutonic
superiority
was
offering
to
the
world
every
individual
submitted
to
intensive
production
the
same
as
a
bit
of
land
from
which
its
owner
wishes
to
get
the
greatest
number
of
vegetables
mankind
reduced
to
mechanics
no
useless
operations
that
would
not
produce
immediate
results
and
the
people
who
heralded
this
awful
idea
were
the
very
philosophers
and
idealists
who
had
once
given
contemplation
and
reflection
the
first
place
in
their
existence
hartrott
again
harked
back
to
the
inferiority
of
their
racial
enemies
in
order
to
combat
successfully
it
required
an
unquenchable
confidence
in
the
superiority
of
their
own
powers
at
this
very
hour
in
berlin
everyone
is
accepting
war
everyone
is
believing
that
victory
is
sure
while
here
i
do
not
say
that
the
french
are
afraid
they
have
a
brave
past
that
galvanizes
them
at
certain
times
but
they
are
so
depressed
that
it
is
easy
to
guess
that
they
will
make
almost
any
sacrifices
in
order
to
evade
what
is
coming
upon
them
the
people
first
will
shout
with
enthusiasm
as
it
always
cheers
that
which
carries
it
to
perdition
the
upper
classes
have
no
faith
in
the
future
they
are
keeping
quiet
but
the
presentiment
of
disaster
may
easily
be
conjectured
yesterday
i
was
talking
with
your
father
he
is
french
and
he
is
rich
he
was
indignant
against
the
government
of
his
country
for
involving
the
nation
in
the
european
conflict
in
order
to
defend
a
distant
and
uninteresting
people
he
complains
of
the
exalted
patriots
who
have
opened
the
abyss
between
germany
and
france
preventing
a
reconciliation
he
says
that
alsace
and
lorraine
are
not
worth
what
a
war
would
cost
in
men
and
money
he
recognizes
our
greatness
and
is
convinced
that
we
have
progressed
so
rapidly
that
the
other
countries
can
not
come
up
to
us
and
as
your
father
thinks
so
do
many
others
all
those
who
are
wrapped
in
creature
comfort
and
fear
to
lose
it
believe
me
a
country
that
hesitates
and
fears
war
is
conquered
before
the
first
julio
evinced
a
certain
disquietude
as
though
he
would
like
to
cut
short
the
conversation
just
leave
my
father
out
of
it
he
speaks
that
way
because
war
is
not
yet
an
accomplished
fact
and
he
has
to
contradict
and
vent
his
indignation
on
whoever
comes
near
him
he
will
say
just
the
opposite
my
father
is
a
the
professor
looked
at
his
watch
he
must
go
there
were
still
many
things
which
he
had
to
do
before
going
to
the
station
the
germans
living
in
paris
had
fled
in
great
bands
as
though
a
secret
order
had
been
circulating
among
them
that
afternoon
the
last
of
those
who
had
been
living
ostensibly
in
the
capital
would
depart
i
have
come
to
see
you
because
of
our
family
interest
because
it
was
my
duty
to
give
you
fair
warning
you
are
a
foreigner
and
nothing
holds
you
here
if
you
are
desirous
of
witnessing
a
great
historic
event
remain
but
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
go
the
war
is
going
to
be
ruthless
very
ruthless
and
if
paris
attempts
resistance
as
formerly
we
shall
see
terrible
things
modes
of
offense
have
greatly
desnoyers
made
a
gesture
of
indifference
the
same
as
your
father
observed
the
professor
last
night
he
and
all
your
family
responded
in
the
same
way
even
my
mother
prefers
to
remain
with
her
sister
saying
that
the
germans
are
very
good
very
civilized
and
there
is
nothing
to
apprehend
in
their
this
good
opinion
seemed
to
be
troubling
the
doctor
they
don
t
understand
what
modern
warfare
means
they
ignore
the
fact
that
our
generals
have
studied
the
art
of
overcoming
the
enemy
and
they
will
apply
it
mercilessly
ruthlessness
is
the
only
means
since
it
perturbs
the
intelligence
of
the
enemy
paralyzes
his
action
and
pulverizes
his
resistance
the
more
ferocious
the
war
the
more
quickly
it
is
concluded
to
punish
with
cruelty
is
to
proceed
humanely
therefore
germany
is
going
to
be
cruel
with
a
cruelty
hitherto
unseen
in
order
that
the
conflict
may
not
be
he
had
risen
and
was
standing
cane
and
straw
hat
in
hand
argensola
was
looking
at
him
with
frank
hostility
the
professor
obliged
to
pass
near
him
did
so
with
a
stiff
and
disdainful
nod
then
he
started
toward
the
door
accompanied
by
his
cousin
the
farewell
was
brief
i
repeat
my
counsel
if
you
do
not
like
danger
go
it
may
be
that
i
am
mistaken
and
that
this
nation
convinced
of
the
uselessness
of
defense
may
give
itself
up
voluntarily
at
any
rate
we
shall
soon
see
i
shall
take
great
pleasure
in
returning
to
paris
when
the
flag
of
the
empire
is
floating
over
the
eiffel
tower
a
mere
matter
of
three
or
four
weeks
certainly
by
the
beginning
of
france
was
going
to
disappear
from
the
map
to
the
doctor
her
death
was
a
foregone
conclusion
paris
will
remain
he
admitted
benevolently
the
french
will
remain
because
a
nation
is
not
easily
suppressed
but
they
will
not
retain
their
former
place
we
shall
govern
the
world
they
will
continue
to
occupy
themselves
in
inventing
fashions
in
making
life
agreeable
for
visiting
foreigners
and
in
the
intellectual
world
we
shall
encourage
them
to
educate
good
actresses
to
produce
entertaining
novels
and
to
write
witty
comedies
nothing
desnoyers
laughed
as
he
shook
his
cousin
s
hand
pretending
to
take
his
words
as
a
paradox
i
mean
it
insisted
hartrott
the
last
hour
of
the
french
republic
as
an
important
nation
has
sounded
i
have
studied
it
at
close
range
and
it
deserves
no
better
fate
license
and
lack
of
confidence
above
sterile
enthusiasm
upon
turning
his
head
he
again
caught
argensola
s
malicious
smile
we
know
all
about
that
kind
of
study
he
added
aggressively
we
are
accustomed
to
examine
the
nations
of
the
past
to
dissect
them
fibre
by
fibre
so
that
we
recognize
at
a
glance
the
psychology
of
the
the
bohemian
fancied
that
he
saw
a
surgeon
talking
about
the
mysteries
of
the
will
before
a
corpse
what
did
this
pedantic
interpreter
of
dead
documents
know
about
life
when
the
door
closed
he
approached
his
friend
who
was
returning
somewhat
dismayed
argensola
no
longer
considered
doctor
julius
von
hartrott
crazy
what
a
brute
he
exclaimed
throwing
up
his
hands
and
to
think
that
they
are
at
large
these
originators
of
gloomy
errors
who
would
ever
believe
that
they
belong
to
the
same
land
that
produced
kant
the
pacifist
the
serene
goethe
and
beethoven
to
think
that
for
so
many
years
we
have
believed
that
they
were
forming
a
nation
of
dreamers
and
philosophers
occupied
in
working
disinterestedly
for
all
mankind
the
sentence
of
a
german
geographer
recurred
to
him
the
german
is
bicephalous
with
one
head
he
dreams
and
poetizes
while
with
the
other
he
thinks
and
desnoyers
was
now
beginning
to
feel
depressed
at
the
certainty
of
war
this
professor
seemed
to
him
even
worse
than
the
herr
counsellor
and
the
other
germans
that
he
had
met
on
the
steamer
his
distress
was
not
only
because
of
his
selfish
thought
as
to
how
the
catastrophe
was
going
to
affect
his
plans
with
marguerite
he
was
suddenly
discovering
that
in
this
hour
of
uncertainty
he
loved
france
he
recognized
it
as
his
father
s
native
land
and
the
scene
of
the
great
revolution
although
he
had
never
mixed
in
political
campaigns
he
was
a
republican
at
heart
and
had
often
ridiculed
certain
of
his
friends
who
adored
kings
and
emperors
thinking
it
a
great
sign
of
distinction
argensola
tried
to
cheer
him
up
who
knows
this
is
a
country
of
surprises
one
must
see
the
frenchman
when
he
tries
to
remedy
his
want
of
foresight
let
that
barbarian
of
a
cousin
of
yours
say
what
he
will
there
is
order
there
is
enthusiasm
worse
off
than
we
were
those
who
lived
in

days
before

disorganized

themselves

an
astonishing
bit

changed

the

compressed
the

waste

and
that
which
was

was
the

were
beginning
the
bombardment
of
belgrade
william
ii
fearing
that
the
intervention
of
the
powers
might
settle
the
differences
between
the
czar
and
the
emperor
of
austria
was
forcing
the
course
of
events
by
declaring
war
upon
russia
then
germany
began
isolating
herself
cutting
off
railroad
and
telegraphic
communications
in
order
to
shroud
in
mystery
her
invading
forces
france
was
watching
this
avalanche
of
events
temperate
in
its
words
and
enthusiasm
a
cool
and
grave
resolution
was
noticeable
everywhere
two
generations
had
come
into
the
world
informed
as
soon
as
they
reached
a
reasonable
age
that
some
day
there
would
undoubtedly
be
war
nobody
wanted
it
the
adversary
imposed
it
but
all
were
accepting
it
with
the
firm
intention
of
fulfilling
their
duty
during
the
daytime
paris
was
very
quiet
concentrating
the
mind
on
the
work
in
hand
only
a
few
groups
of
exalted
patriots
following
the
tricolored
flag
were
passing
through
the
place
de
la
concorde
in
order
to
salute
the
statue
of
strasbourg
the
people
were
accosting
each
other
in
a
friendly
way
in
the
streets
everybody
seemed
to
know
everybody
else
although
they
might
not
have
met
before
eye
attracted
eye
and
smiles
appeared
to
broaden
mutually
with
the
sympathy
of
a
common
interest
the
women
were
sad
but
speaking
cheerily
in
order
to
hide
their
emotions
in
the
long
summer
twilight
the
boulevards
were
filling
with
crowds
those
from
the
outlying
districts
were
converging
toward
the
centre
of
the
city
as
in
the
remote
revolutionary
days
banding
together
in
groups
forming
an
endless
multitude
from
which
came
shouts
and
songs
these
manifestations
were
passing
through
the
centre
under
the
electric
lights
that
were
just
being
turned
on
the
processions
generally
lasting
until
midnight
with
the
national
banner
floating
above
the
walking
crowds
escorted
by
the
flags
of
other
nations
it
was
on
one
of
these
nights
of
sincere
enthusiasm
that
the
two
friends
heard
an
unexpected
astonishing
piece
of
news
they
have
killed
jaures
the
groups
were
repeating
it
from
one
to
another
with
an
amazement
which
seemed
to
overpower
their
grief
jaures
assassinated
and
what
for
the
best
popular
element
which
instinctively
seeks
an
explanation
of
every
proceeding
remained
in
suspense
not
knowing
which
way
to
turn
the
tribune
dead
at
the
very
moment
that
his
word
as
welder
of
the
people
was
most
needed
argensola
thought
immediately
of
tchernoff
what
will
our
neighbors
say
the
quiet
orderly
people
of
paris
were
fearing
a
revolution
and
for
a
few
moments
desnoyers
believed
that
his
cousin
s
auguries
were
about
to
be
fulfilled
this
assassination
with
its
retaliations
might
be
the
signal
for
civil
war
but
the
masses
of
the
people
worn
out
with
grief
at
the
death
of
their
hero
were
waiting
in
tragic
silence
all
were
seeing
beyond
his
dead
body
the
image
of
the
country
by
the
following
morning
the
danger
had
vanished
the
laboring
classes
were
talking
of
generals
and
war
showing
each
other
their
little
military
memorandums
announcing
the
date
of
their
departure
as
soon
as
the
order
of
mobilization
should
be
published
i
go
the
second
i
the
those
of
the
standing
army
who
were
on
leave
were
recalled
individually
to
the
barracks
all
these
events
were
tending
in
the
same
direction
war
the
germans
were
invading
luxembourg
the
germans
were
ordering
their
armies
to
invade
the
french
frontier
when
their
ambassador
was
still
in
paris
making
promises
of
peace
on
the
day
after
the
death
of
jaures
the
first
of
august
the
people
were
crowding
around
some
pieces
of
paper
written
by
hand
and
in
evident
haste
these
papers
were
copies
of
other
larger
printed
sheets
headed
by
two
crossed
flags
it
has
come
it
is
now
a
fact
it
was
the
order
for
general
mobilization
all
france
was
about
to
take
up
arms
and
chests
seemed
to
expand
with
a
sigh
of
relief
eyes
were
sparkling
with
excitement
the
nightmare
was
at
last
over
cruel
reality
was
preferable
to
the
uncertainty
of
days
and
days
each
as
long
as
a
week
in
vain
president
poincare
animated
by
a
last
hope
was
explaining
to
the
french
that
mobilization
is
not
necessarily
war
that
a
call
to
arms
may
be
simply
a
preventive
it
is
war
inevitable
war
said
the
populace
with
a
fatalistic
expression
and
those
who
were
going
to
start
that
very
night
or
the
following
day
were
the
most
eager
and
now
those
who
seek
us
are
going
to
find
us
vive
la
france
the
chant
du
depart
the
martial
hymn
of
the
volunteers
of
the
first
republic
had
been
exhumed
by
the
instinct
of
a
people
which
seek
the
voice
of
art
in
its
most
critical
moments
the
stanzas
of
the
conservative
chenier
adapted
to
a
music
of
warlike
solemnity
were
resounding
through
the
streets
at
the
same
time
as
the
marseillaise
la
republique
nous
appelle
sachons
vaincre
ou
sachons
perir

francais

the
mobilization
began
at
midnight
to
the
minute
at
dusk
groups
of
men
began
moving
through
the
streets
towards
the
stations
their
families
were
walking
beside
them
carrying
the
valise
or
bundle
of
clothes
they
were
escorted
by
the
friends
of
their
district
the
tricolored
flag
borne
aloft
at
the
head
of
these
platoons
the
reserves
were
donning
their
old
uniforms
which
presented
all
the
difficulties
of
suits
long
ago
forgotten
with
new
leather
belts
and
their
revolvers
at
their
sides
they
were
betaking
themselves
to
the
railway
which
was
to
carry
them
to
the
point
of
concentration
one
of
their
children
was
carrying
the
old
sword
in
its
cloth
sheath
the
wife
was
hanging
on
his
arm
sad
and
proud
at
the
same
time
giving
her
last
counsels
in
a
loving
whisper
street
cars
automobiles
and
cabs
rolled
by
with
crazy
velocity
nobody
had
ever
seen
so
many
vehicles
in
the
paris
streets
yet
if
anybody
needed
one
he
called
in
vain
to
the
conductors
for
none
wished
to
serve
mere
civilians
all
means
of
transportation
were
for
military
men
all
roads
ended
at
the
railroad
stations
the
heavy
trucks
of
the
administration
filled
with
sacks
were
saluted
with
general
enthusiasm
hurrah
for
the
army
the
soldiers
in
mechanic
s
garb
on
top
of
the
swaying
pyramid
replied
to
the
cheers
waving
their
arms
and
uttering
shouts
that
nobody
pretended
to
understand
fraternity
had
created
a
tolerance
hitherto
unknown
the
crowds
were
pressing
forward
but
in
their
encounters
invariably
preserved
good
order
vehicles
were
running
into
each
other
and
when
the
conductors
resorted
to
the
customary
threats
the
crowds
would
intervene
and
make
them
shake
hands
three
cheers
for
france
the
pedestrians
escaping
between
the
wheels
of
the
automobiles
were
laughing
and
reproaching
the
chauffeur
with
would
you
kill
a
frenchman
on
his
way
to
his
regiment
and
the
conductor
would
reply
i
too
am
going
in
a
few
hours
this
is
my
last
as
night
approached
cars
and
cabs
were
running
with
increasing
irregularity
many
of
the
employees
having
abandoned
their
posts
to
take
leave
of
their
families
and
make
the
train
all
the
life
of
paris
was
concentrating
itself
in
a
human
rivers
emptying
in
the
stations
desnoyers
and
argensola
met
in
a
boulevard
cafe
toward
midnight
both
were
exhausted
by
the
day
s
emotions
and
under
that
nervous
depression
which
follows
noisy
and
violent
spectacles
they
needed
to
rest
war
was
a
fact
and
now
that
it
was
a
certainty
they
felt
no
anxiety
to
get
further
news
remaining
in
the
cafe
proved
impossible
in
the
hot
and
smoky
atmosphere
the
occupants
were
singing
and
shouting
and
waving
tiny
flags
all
the
battle
hymns
of
the
past
and
present
were
here
intoned
in
chorus
to
an
accompaniment
of
glasses
and
plates
the
rather
cosmopolitan
clientele
was
reviewing
the
european
nations
all
absolutely
all
were
going
to
enroll
themselves
on
the
side
of
france
hurrah
hurrah
an
old
man
and
his
wife
were
seated
at
a
table
near
the
two
friends
they
were
tenants
of
an
orderly
humdrum
walk
in
life
who
perhaps
in
all
their
existence
had
never
been
awake
at
such
an
hour
in
the
general
enthusiasm
they
had
come
to
the
boulevards
in
order
to
see
war
a
little
the
foreign
tongue
used
by
his
neighbors
gave
the
husband
a
lofty
idea
of
their
importance
do
you
believe
that
england
is
going
to
join
us
argensola
knew
as
much
about
it
as
he
but
he
replied
authoritatively
of
course
she
will
that
s
a
sure
thing
the
old
man
rose
to
his
feet
hurrah
for
england
and
he
began
chanting
a
forgotten
patriotic
song
marking
time
with
his
arms
in
a
spirited
way
to
the
great
admiration
of
his
old
wife
and
urging
all
to
join
in
the
chorus
that
very
few
were
able
to
follow
the
two
friends
had
to
take
themselves
home
on
foot
they
could
not
find
a
vehicle
that
would
stop
for
them
all
were
hurrying
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
the
stations
they
were
both
in
a
bad
humor
but
argensola
couldn
t
keep
his
to
himself
ah
these
women
desnoyers
knew
all
about
his
relations
so
far
honorable
with
a
midinette
from
the
rue

sunday
strolls
in
the
suburbs
of
paris
various
trips
to
the
moving
picture
shows
comments
upon
the
fine
points
of
the
latest
novel
published
in
the
sheets
of
a
popular
paper
kisses
of
farewell
when
she
took
the
night
train
from
bois
colombes
in
order
to
sleep
at
home
that
was
all
but
argensola
was
wickedly
counting
on
father
time
to
mellow
the
sharpest
virtues
that
evening
they
had
taken
some
refreshment
with
a
french
friend
who
was
going
the
next
morning
to
join
his
regiment
the
girl
had
sometimes
seen
him
with
argensola
without
noticing
him
particularly
but
now
she
suddenly
began
admiring
him
as
though
he
were
another
person
she
had
given
up
the
idea
of
returning
home
that
night
she
wanted
to
see
how
a
war
begins
the
three
had
dined
together
and
all
her
interest
had
centred
upon
the
one
who
was
going
away
she
even
took
offense
with
sudden
modesty
when
argensola
tried
as
he
had
often
done
before
to
squeeze
her
hand
under
the
table
meanwhile
she
was
almost
leaning
her
head
on
the
shoulder
of
the
future
hero
enveloping
him
with
admiring
gaze
and
they
have
gone
they
have
gone
away
together
said
the
spaniard
bitterly
i
had
to
leave
them
in
order
not
to
make
my
hard
luck
any
worse
to
have
worked
so
long
for
another
he
was
silent
for
a
few
minutes
then
changing
the
trend
of
his
ideas
he
added
i
recognize
nevertheless
that
her
behavior
is
beautiful
the
generosity
of
these
women
when
they
believe
that
the
moment
for
sacrifice
has
come
she
is
terribly
afraid
of
her
father
and
yet
she
stays
away
from
home
all
night
with
a
person
whom
she
hardly
knows
and
whom
she
was
not
even
thinking
of
in
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
entire
nation
feels
gratitude
toward
those
who
are
going
to
imperil
their
lives
and
she
poor
child
wishing
to
do
something
too
for
those
destined
for
death
to
give
them
a
little
pleasure
in
their
last
hour
is
giving
the
best
she
has
that
which
she
can
never
recover
i
have
sketched
her
role
poorly
perhaps
laugh
at
me
if
you
want
to
but
admit
that
it
is
desnoyers
laughed
heartily
at
his
friend
s
discomfiture
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
he
too
was
suffering
a
good
deal
of
secret
annoyance
he
had
seen
marguerite
but
once
since
the
day
of
his
return
the
only
news
of
her
that
he
had
received
was
by
letter
this
cursed
war
what
an
upset
for
happy
people
marguerite
s
mother
was
she
was
brooding
over
the
departure
of
her
son
an
officer
on
the
first
day
of
the
mobilization
marguerite
too
was
uneasy
about
her
brother
and
did
not
think
it
expedient
to
come
to
the
studio
while
her
mother
was
grieving
at
home
when
was
this
situation
ever
to
end
that
check
for
four
hundred
thousand
francs
which
he
had
brought
from
america
was
also
worrying
him
the
day
before
the
bank
had
declined
to
pay
it
for
lack
of
the
customary
official
advice
afterward
they
said
that
they
had
received
the
advice
but
did
not
give
him
the
money
that
very
afternoon
when
the
trust
companies
had
closed
their
doors
the
government
had
already
declared
a
moratorium
in
order
to
prevent
a
general
bankruptcy
due
to
the
general
panic
when
would
they
pay
him
perhaps
when
the
war
which
had
not
yet
begun
was
ended
perhaps
never
he
had
no
other
money
available
except
the
two
thousand
francs
left
over
from
his
travelling
expenses
all
of
his
friends
were
in
the
same
distressing
situation
unable
to
draw
on
the
sums
which
they
had
in
the
banks
those
who
had
any
money
were
obliged
to
go
from
shop
to
shop
or
form
in
line
at
the
bank
doors
in
order
to
get
a
bill
changed
oh
this
war
this
stupid
war
in
the
champs
elysees
they
saw
a
man
with
a
hat
who
was
walking
slowly
ahead
of
them
and
talking
to
himself
argensola
recognized
him
as
he
passed
near
the
street
lamp
friend
upon
returning
their
greeting
the
russian
betrayed
a
slight
odor
of
wine
uninvited
he
had
adjusted
his
steps
to
theirs
accompanying
them
toward
the
arc
de
triomphe
julio
had
merely
exchanged
silent
nods
with
argensola
s
new
acquaintance
when
encountering
him
in
the
vestibule
but
sadness
softens
the
heart
and
makes
us
seek
the
friendship
of
the
humble
as
a
refreshing
shelter
tchernoff
on
the
contrary
looked
at
desnoyers
as
though
he
had
known
him
all
his
life
the
man
had
interrupted
his
monologue
heard
only
by
the
black
masses
of
vegetation
the
blue
shadows
perforated
by
the
reddish
tremors
of
the
street
lights
the
summer
night
with
its
cupola
of
warm
breezes
and
twinkling
stars
he
took
a
few
steps
without
saying
anything
as
a
mark
of
consideration
to
his
companions
and
then
renewed
his
arguments
taking
them
up
where
he
had
broken
off
without
offering
any
explanation
as
though
he
were
still
talking
to
himself
and
at
this
very
minute
they
are
shouting
with
enthusiasm
the
same
as
they
are
doing
here
honestly
believing
that
they
are
going
to
defend
their
outraged
country
wishing
to
die
for
their
families
and
firesides
that
nobody
has
who
are
they
tchernoff
asked
argensola
the
russian
stared
at
him
as
though
surprised
at
such
a
question
they
he
said
laconically
the
two
understood
they
it
could
not
be
anyone
else
i
have
lived
ten
years
in
germany
he
continued
connecting
up
his
words
now
that
he
found
himself
listened
to
i
was
daily
correspondent
for
a
paper
in
berlin
and
i
know
these
people
passing
along
these
thronged
boulevards
i
have
been
seeing
in
my
imagination
what
must
be
happening
there
at
this
hour
they
too
are
singing
and
shouting
with
enthusiasm
as
they
wave
their
flags
on
the
outside
they
seem
just
alike
but
oh
what
a
difference
within
last
night
the
people
beset
a
few
babblers
in
the
boulevard
who
were
yelling
to
berlin
a
slogan
of
bad
memories
and
worse
taste
france
does
not
wish
conquests
her
only
desire
is
to
be
respected
to
live
in
peace
without
humiliations
or
disturbances
two
of
the
mobilized
men
said
on
leaving
when
we
enter
germany
we
are
going
to
make
it
a
republic
a
republic
is
not
a
perfect
thing
but
it
is
better
than
living
under
an
irresponsible
monarchy
by
the
grace
of
god
it
at
least
presupposes
tranquillity
and
absence
of
the
personal
ambitions
that
disturb
life
i
was
impressed
by
the
generous
thought
of
these
laboring
men
who
instead
of
wishing
to
exterminate
their
enemies
were
planning
to
give
them
something
tchernoff
remained
silent
a
few
minutes
smiling
ironically
at
the
picture
which
his
imagination
was
calling
forth
in
berlin
the
masses
are
expressing
their
enthusiasm
in
the
lofty
phraseology
befitting
a
superior
people

the

we

in

there
is
another

one
that
elevates
the

and
does
not
permit
human

to
suffer
without
protesting
against
continual
humiliations
a
swiss
living
in
his
wooden

and
considering
himself
the
equal
of
the
other

of

is
more
civilized

i

something
about
that

opposed

always
existed
a

the
rest
has
a

a
lofty

which
faces
danger
and
sacrifice
because
of
liberty
and
truth
and
germany
who
there
has
ever
raised

corrected
with

so
as
to
crush
completely
the

at

if
such
ever
really
existed
and
when
his

were
threatening
him
with

the
ferocious

merely
put

roared
with
the
most
insolent
of
horse
laughs
a
revolution
in
prussia
nothing
at
all
as
he
knew
his
people
tchernoff
was
not
a
patriot
many
a
time
argensola
had
heard
him
railing
against
his
country
but
now
he
was
indignant
in
view
of
the
contempt
with
which
teutonic
haughtiness
was
treating
the
russian
nation
where
in
the
last
forty
years
of
imperial
grandeur
was
that
universal
supremacy
of
which
the
germans
were
everlastingly
boasting
excellent
workers
in
science
tenacious
and
academicians
each
wrapped
in
his
specialty
benedictines
of
the

who
experimented
painstakingly
and
occasionally
hit
upon
something
in
spite
of
enormous
blunders
given
out
as

because
they
were
their
own
that
was
all
and
side
by
side
with
such
patient
laboriosity
really
worthy
of
respect
what
charlatanism
what
great

exploited
as
a

how
many

turned
into

of

inferior

who

without
stooping
to
form

german
science
continued
tchernoff
has
given
much
to
humanity
i
admit
that
but
the
science
of
other
nations
has
done
as
much
only
a
nation
puffed
up
with
conceit
could
imagine
that
it
has
done
everything
for
civilization
and
the
others
nothing
apart
from
their
learned
specialists
what
genius
has
been
produced
in
our
day
by
this
germany
which
believes
itself
so
transcendent
wagner
the
last
of
the
romanticists
closes
an
epoch
and
belongs
to
the
past
nietzsche
took
pains
to
proclaim
his
polish
origin
and
abominated
germany
a
country
according
to
him
of
pedants
his
slavism
was
so
pronounced
that
he
even
prophesied
the
overthrow
of
the
prussians
by
the
slavs
and
there
are
others
we
although
a
savage
people
have
given
the
world
of
modern
times
an
admirable
moral
grandeur
tolstoi
and
dostoievsky
are
what
names
can
the
germany
of
william
ii
put
ahead
of
these
his
country
was
the
country
of
music
but
the
russian
musicians
of
are
more
original
than
the
mere
followers
of
wagner
the
copyists
who
take
refuge
in
orchestral
exasperations
in
order
to
hide
their
mediocrity
in
its
time
of
stress
the
german
nation
had
men
of
genius
before
had
been
born
when
the
empire
did
not
exist
goethe
schiller
beethoven
were
subjects
of
little
principalities
they
received
influence
from
other
countries
and
contributed
their
share
to
the
universal
civilization
like
citizens
of
the
world
without
insisting
that
the
world
should
therefore
become
czarism
had
committed
atrocities
tchernoff
knew
that
by
experience
and
did
not
need
the
germans
to
assure
him
of
it
but
all
the
illustrious
classes
of
russia
were
enemies
of
that
tyranny
and
were
protesting
against
it
where
in
germany
were
the
intellectual
enemies
of
prussian
czarism
they
were
either
holding
their
peace
or
breaking
forth
into
adulation
of
the
anointed
of
the
lord
a
musician
and
comedian
like
nero
of
a
sharp
and
superficial
intelligence
who
believed
that
by
merely
skimming
through
anything
he
knew
it
all
eager
to
strike
a
spectacular
pose
in
history
he
had
finally
afflicted
the
world
with
the
greatest
of
calamities
why
must
the
tyranny
that
weighs
upon
my
country
necessarily
be
russian
the
worst
czars
were
imitators
of
prussia
every
time
that
the
russian
people
of
our
day
have
attempted
to
revindicate
their
rights
the
reactionaries
have
used
the
kaiser
as
a
threat
proclaiming
that
he
would
come
to
their
aid
of
the
russian
aristocracy
is
german
the
functionaries
who
advise
and
support
despotism
are
germans
german
too
are
the
generals
who
have
distinguished
themselves
by
massacring
the
people
german
are
the
officials
who
undertake
to
punish
the
laborers
strikes
and
the
rebellion
of
their
allies
the
reactionary
slav
is
brutal
but
he
has
the
fine
sensibility
of
a
race
in
which
many
princes
have
become
nihilists
he
raises
the
lash
with
facility
but
then
he
repents
and
oftentimes
weeps
i
have
seen
russian
officials
kill
themselves
rather
than
march
against
the
people
or
through
remorse
for
slaughter
committed
the
german
in
the
service
of
the
czar
feels
no
scruples
nor
laments
his
conduct
he
kills
coldly
with
the
minuteness
and
exactitude
with
which
he
does
everything
the
russian
is
a
barbarian
who
strikes
and
regrets
german
civilization
shoots
without
hesitation
our
slav
czar
in
a
humanitarian
dream
favored
the
utopian
idea
of
universal
peace
organizing
the
conference
of
the
hague
the
kaiser
of
culture
meanwhile
has
been
working
years
and
years
in
the
erection
and
establishment
of
a
destructive
organ
of
an
immensity
heretofore
unknown
in
order
to
crush
all
europe
the
russian
is
a
humble
christian
socialistic
democratic
thirsting
for
justice
the
german
prides
himself
upon
his
christianity
but
is
an
idolator
like
the
german
of
other
centuries
his
religion
loves
blood
and
maintains
castes
his
true
worship
is
that
of
odin
only
that
nowadays
the
god
of
slaughter
has
changed
his
name
and
calls
himself
the
state
tchernoff
paused
an
instant
perhaps
in
order
to
increase
the
wonder
of
his
companions
and
then
said
with
simplicity
i
am
a
argensola
who
already
knew
the
ideas
and
history
of
the
russian
started
with
astonishment
and
julio
persisted
in
his
suspicion
surely
tchernoff
is
it
is
true
declared
the
russian
earnestly
that
i
do
not
worry
about
god
nor
do
i
believe
in
dogmas
but
my
soul
is
christian
as
is
that
of
all
revolutionists
the
philosophy
of
modern
democracy
is
lay
christianity
we
socialists
love
the
humble
the
needy
the
weak
we
defend
their
right
to
life
and
as
did
the
greatest
lights
of
the
religious
world
who
saw
a
brother
in
every
unfortunate
we
exact
respect
for
the
poor
in
the
name
of
justice
the
others
ask
for
it
in
the
name
of
charity
that
only
separates
us
but
we
strive
that
mankind
may
by
common
consent
lead
a
better
life
that
the
strong
may
sacrifice
for
the
weak
the
lofty
for
the
lowly
and
the
world
be
ruled
by
brotherliness
seeking
the
greatest
equality
the
slav
reviewed
the
history
of

greek
thought
had
brought
comfort
a
sense
of
on
the

but
only
for
the
few
for
the
citizens
of
the
little
democracies
for
the
free
men
leaving
the
slaves
and
barbarians
who
constituted
the
majority
in
their
misery
christianity
the
religion
of
the
lowly
had
recognized
the
right
of
happiness
for
all
mankind
but
this
happiness
was
placed
in
heaven
far
from
this
world
this
vale
of
the
revolution
and
its
heirs
the
socialists
were
trying
to
place
happiness
in
the
immediate
realities
of
earth
like
the
ancients
but
making
all
humanity
participants
in
it
like
the
christians
where
is
the
christianity
of
modern
germany
there
is
far
more
genuine
christian
spirit
in
the
fraternal
laity
of
the
french
republic
defender
of
the
weak
than
in
the
religiosity
of
the
conservative
junkers
germany
has
made
a
god
in
her
own
image
believing
that
she
adores
it
but
in
reality
adoring
her
own
image
the
german
god
is
a
reflex
of
the
german
state
which
considers
war
as
the
first
activity
of
a
nation
and
the
noblest
of
occupations
other
christian
peoples
when
they
have
to
go
to
war
feel
the
contradiction
that
exists
between
their
conduct
and
the
teachings
of
the
gospel
and
excuse
themselves
by
showing
the
cruel
necessity
which
impels
them
germany
declares
that
war
is
acceptable
to
god
i
have
heard
german
sermons
proving
that
jesus
was
in
favor
of
militarism
teutonic

the
conviction
that
its

is
providentially
destined
to
dominate

far
above
their
differences

that
god
of
the

which
is
german
the
warrior
god
to
whom
william
is
probably
referring
as
my
worthy
religions
always
tend
toward
universality
their
aim
is
to
place
humanity
in
relationship
with

and
to
sustain
these
relations
among
mankind
prussia
has
retrograded
to
barbarism
creating
for
its
personal
use
a
second
jehovah
a
divinity
hostile
to
the
greater
part
of
the
human
race
who
makes
his
own
the
grudges

tchernoff
then
explained
in
his
own
way
the
creation
of
this

the
germans

comparatively
recent
christians
their
christianity
was
not
more
than
six
centuries
old

the
crusades
were
drawing
to
a
close
the
prussians
were
still
living
in
paganism
pride
of
race
impelling
them
to
war
had
revived
these
dead
divinities
the
god
of
the
gospel
was
now
adorned
by
the
germans
with
lance
and
shield
like
the
old
teutonic
god
who
was
a
military
chief
christianity
in
berlin
wears
helmet
and
riding
boots
god
at
this
moment
is
seeing
himself
mobilized
the
same
as
otto
fritz
and
franz
in
order
to
punish
the
enemies
of
his
chosen
people
that
the
lord
has
commanded
thou
shalt
not
kill
and
his
son
has
said
to
the
world
blessed
are
the
peacemakers
no
longer

christianity
according
to
its
german
priests
of
all
creeds
can
only
influence
the
individual
betterment
of
mankind
and
should
not
mix
itself
in
affairs
of

the
prussian
god
of
the

the
old
german
god
the
lineal
descendant
of

ferocious

the
acrid
odor

german
religiosity
continued
the
russian
is
the
disavowal
of
christianity
in
its
eyes
men
are
no
longer
equal
before
god
their
god
is
interested
only
in
the
strong
and
favors
them
with
his
support
so
that
they
may
dare
anything
those
born
weak
must
either
submit
or
disappear
neither
are
nations
equal
but
are
divided
into
leaders

inferior
races
whose
destiny
is
to
be
sifted
out

absorbed
by
their

is
the
action
of
a
state
that
organizes
and
assimilates
individuals
and
communities
in
order
to
utilize
them
for
its
own

and
these
ends
consist
mainly
in

overwhelming
them
with

or
what
is
the

thing
with
their
haughty
and
violent
by
this
time
the
three
had
reached
the
place
de
l
etoile
the
dark
outline
of
the
arc
de
triomphe
stood
forth
clearly
in
the
starry
expanse
the
avenues
extended
in
all
directions
a
double
file
of
lights
those
around
the
monument
illuminated
its
gigantic
bases
and
the
feet
of
the
sculptured
groups
further
up
the
vaulted
spaces
were
so
locked
in
shadow
that
they
had
the
black
density
of
ebony
upon
passing
under
the
arch
which
greatly
intensified
the
echo
of
their
footsteps
they
came
to
a
standstill
the
night
breeze
had
a
wintry
chill
as
it
whistled
past
and
the
curved
masses
seemed
melting
into
the
diffused
blue
of
space
instinctively
the
three
turned
to
glance
back
at
the
champs
elysees
they
saw
only
a
river
of
shadow
on
which
were
floating
rosaries
of
red
stars
among
the
two
long
black
scarfs
formed
by
the
buildings
but
they
were
so
well
acquainted
with
this
panorama
that
in
imagination
they
mentally
saw
the
majestic
sweep
of
the
avenue
the
double
row
of
palaces
the
place
de
la
concorde
in
the
background
with
the
egyptian
obelisk
and
the
trees
of
the
tuileries
how
beautiful
it
is
exclaimed
tchernoff
who
was
seeing
something
beyond
the
shadows
an
entire
civilization
loving
peace
and
pleasure
has
passed
through
a
memory
greatly
affected
the
russian
many
an
afternoon
after
lunch
he
had
met
in
this
very
spot
a
robust
man
stocky
with
reddish
beard
and
kindly
eyes
a
man
who
looked
like
a
giant
who
had
just
stopped
growing
he
was
always
accompanied
by
a
dog
it
was
jaures
his
friend
jaures
who
before
going
to
the
senate
was
accustomed
to
taking
a
walk
toward
the
arch
from
his
home
in
passy
he
liked
to
come
just
where
we
are
now
he
loved
to
look
at
the
avenues
the
distant
gardens
all
of
paris
which
can
be
seen
from
this
height
and
filled
with
admiration
he
would
often
say
to
me
this
is
magnificent
one
of
the
most
beautiful
perspectives
that
can
be
found
in
the
entire
poor
jaures
through
association
of
ideas
the
russian
evoked
the
image
of
his
compatriot
michael
bakounine
another
revolutionist
the
father
of
anarchy
weeping
with
emotion
at
a
concert
after
hearing
the
symphony
with
beethoven
chorals
directed
by
a
young
friend
of
his
named
richard
wagner
when
our
revolution
comes
he
cried
clasping
the
hand
of
the
master
whatever
else
may
perish
this
must
be
saved
at
any
cost
tchernoff
roused
himself
from
his
reveries
to
look
around
him
and
say
with
sadness
they
have
passed
through
here
every
time
that
he
walked
through
the
arch
the
same
vision
would
spring
up
in
his
mind
they
were
thousands
of
helmets
glistening
in
the
sun
thousands
of
heavy
boots
lifted
with
mechanical
rigidity
at
the
same
time
horns
fifes
drums
large
and
small
clashing
against
the
majestic
silence
of
these
stones
the
warlike
march
from
lohengrin
sounding
in
the
deserted
avenues
before
the
closed
houses
he
who
was
a
foreigner
always
felt
attracted
by
the
spell
exerted
by
venerable
buildings
guarding
the
glory
of
a
bygone
day
he
did
not
wish
to
know
who
had
erected
it
as
soon
as
its
pride
is
flattered
mankind
tries
immediately
to
solidify
it
then
humanity
intervenes
with
a
broader
vision
that
changes
the
original
significance
of
the
work
enlarges
it
and
strips
it
of
its
first
egotistical
import
the
greek
statues
models
of
the
highest
beauty
had
been
originally
mere
images
of
the
temple
donated
by
the
piety
of
the
devotees
of
those
times
upon
evoking
roman
grandeur
everybody
sees
in
imagination
the
enormous
coliseum
circle
of
butcheries
or
the
arches
erected
to
the
glory
of
the
inept
caesars
the
representative
works
of
nations
have
two
significations
the
interior
or
immediate
one
which
their
creators
gave
them
and
the
exterior
or
universal
interest
the
symbolic
value
which
the
centuries
have
given
them
this
arch
continued
tchernoff
is
french
within
with
its
names
of
battles
and
generals
open
to
criticism
on
the
outside
it
is
the
monument
of
the
people
who
carried
through
the
greatest
revolution
for
liberty
ever
known
the
glorification
of
man
is
there
below
in
the
column
of
the
place
vendome
here
there
is
nothing
individual
its
builders
erected
it
to
the
memory
of
la
grande
armee
and
that
grand
army
was
the
people
in
arms
who
spread
revolution
throughout
europe
the
artists
great
inventors
foresaw
the
true
significance
of
this
work
the
warriors
of
rude
who
are
chanting
the
marseillaise
in
the
group
at
the
left
are
not
professional
soldiers
they
are
armed
citizens
marching
to
work
out
their
sublime
and
violent
mission
their
nudity
makes
them
appear
to
me
like
in
grecian
helmets
here
there
is
more
than
the
glory
and
egoism
of
a
great
nation
all
europe
is
awake
to
new
life
thanks
to
these
crusaders
of
liberty
the
nations
call
to
mind
certain
images
if
i
think
of
greece
i
see
the
columns
of
the
parthenon
rome
mistress
of
the
world
is
the
coliseum
and
the
arch
of
trajan
and
revolutionary
france
is
the
arc
de
the
arch
was
even
more
according
to
the
russian
it
represented
a
great
historical
retaliation
the
nations
of
the
south
called
the
latin
races
replying
after
many
centuries
to
the
invasion
which
had
destroyed
the
roman
jurisdiction
the
mediterranean
peoples
spreading
themselves
as
conquerors
through
the
lands
of
the
ancient
barbarians
retreating
immediately
they
had
swept
away
the
past
like
a
tidal
wave
the
great
surf
depositing
all
that
it
contained
like
the
waters
of
certain
rivers
which
fructify
by
overflowing
this
recession
of
the
human
tide
had
left
the
soil
enriched
with
new
and
generous
ideas
if
they
should
return
added
tchernoff
with
a
look
of
uneasiness
if
they
again
should
tread
these
stones
before
they
were
folk
stunned
by
their
rapid
who
passed
through
here
like
a
farmer
through
a
salon
they
were
content
with
money
for
the
pocket
and
two
provinces
which
should
perpetuate
the
memory
of
their
victory
but
now
they
will
not
be
the
soldiers
only
who
march
against
paris
at
the
tail
of
the
armies
come
the
maddened
the
herr
professors
carrying
at
the
side
the
little
keg
of
wine
with
the
powder
which
crazes
the
barbarian
the
wine
of
kultur
and
in
the
vans
come
also
an
enormous
load
of
scientific
savagery
a
new
philosophy
which
glorifies
force
as
a
principle
and
sanctifier
of
everything
denies
liberty
suppresses
the
weak
and
places
the
entire
world
under
the
charge
of
a
minority
chosen
by
god
just
because
it
possesses
the
surest
and
most
rapid
methods
of
slaughter
humanity
may
well
tremble
for
the
future
if
again
resounds
under
this
archway
the
tramp
of
boots
following
a
march
of
wagner
or
any
other
they
left
the
arch
following
the
avenue
victor
hugo
tchernoff
walking
along
in
dogged
silence
as
though
the
vision
of
this
imaginary
procession
had
overwhelmed
him
suddenly
he
continued
aloud
the
course
of
his
reflections
and
if
they
should
enter
what
does
it
matter
on
that
account
the
cause
of
right
will
not
die
it
suffers
eclipses
but
is
born
again
it
may
be
ignored
and
trampled
under
foot
but
it
does
not
therefore
cease
to
exist
and
all
good
souls
recognize
it
as
the
only
rule
of
life
a
nation
of
madmen
wishes
to
place
might
upon
the
pedestal
that
others
have
raised
to
right
useless
endeavor
the
eternal
hope
of
mankind
will
ever
be
the
increasing
power
of
more
liberty
more
brotherliness
more
the
russian
appeared
to
calm
himself
with
this
statement
he
and
his
friends
spoke
of
the
spectacle
which
paris
was
presenting
in
its
preparation
for
war
tchernoff
bemoaned
the
great
suffering
produced
by
the
catastrophe
the
thousands
and
thousands
of
domestic
tragedies
that
were
unrolling
at
that
moment
apparently
nothing
had
changed
in
the
centre
of
the
city
and
around
the
stations
there
was
unusual
agitation
but
the
rest
of
the
immense
city
did
not
appear
affected
by
the
great
overthrow
of
its
existence
the
solitary
street
was
presenting
its
usual
aspect
the
breeze
was
gently
moving
the
leaves
a
solemn
peace
seemed
to
be
spreading
itself
through
space
the
houses
appeared
wrapped
in
slumber
but
behind
the
closed
windows
might
be
surmised
the
insomnia
of
the
reddened
eyes
the
sighs
from
hearts
anguished
by
the
threatened
danger
the
tremulous
agility
of
the
hands
preparing
the
war
outfit
perhaps
the
last
loving
greetings
exchanged
without
pleasure
with
kisses
ending
in
sobs
tchernoff
thought
of
his
neighbors
the
husband
and
wife
who
occupied
the
other
interior
apartment
behind
the
studio
she
was
no
longer
playing
the
piano
the
russian
had
overheard
disputes
the
banging
of
doors
locked
with
violence
and
the
footsteps
of
a
man
in
the
middle
of
the
night
fleeing
from
a
woman
s
cries
there
had
begun
to
develop
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
a
regulation
drama
a
repetition
of
hundreds
of
others
all
taking
place
at
the
same
time
she
is
a
german
volunteered
the
russian
our
concierge
has
ferreted
out
her
nationality
he
must
have
gone
by
this
time
to
join
his
regiment
last
night
i
could
hardly
sleep
i
heard
the
lamentations
through
the
thin
wall
partition
the
steady
desperate
weeping
of
an
abandoned
child
and
the
voice
of
a
man
who
was
vainly
trying
to
quiet
her
ah
what
a
rain
of
sorrows
is
now
falling
upon
the
world
that
same
evening
on
leaving
the
house
he
had
met
her
by
her
door
she
appeared
like
another
woman
with
an
old
look
as
though
in
these
agonizing
hours
she
had
been
suffering
for
fifteen
years
in
vain
the
kindly
tchernoff
had
tried
to
cheer
her
up
urging
her
to
accept
quietly
her
husband
s
absence
so
as
not
to
harm
the
little
one
who
was
coming
for
the
unhappy
creature
is
going
to
be
a
mother
he
said
sadly
she
hides
her
condition
with
a
certain
modesty
but
from
my
window
i
have
often
seen
her
making
the
dainty
the
woman
had
listened
to
him
as
though
she
did
not
understand
words
were
useless
before
her
desperation
she
could
only
sob
as
though
talking
to
herself
i
am
a
german
he
has
gone
he
has
to
go
away
alone
alone
forever
she
is
thinking
all
the
time
of
her
nationality
which
is
separating
her
from
her
husband
she
is
thinking
of
the
concentration
camp
to
which
they
will
take
her
with
her
compatriots
she
is
fearful
of
being
abandoned
in
the
enemy
s
country
obliged
to
defend
itself
against
the
attack
of
her
own
country
and
all
this
when
she
is
about
to
become
a
mother
what
miseries
what
agonies
the
three
reached
the
rue
de
la
pompe
and
on
entering
the
house
tchernoff
began
to
take
leave
of
his
companions
in
order
to
climb
the
service
stairs
but
desnoyers
wished
to
prolong
the
conversation
he
dreaded
being
alone
with
his
friend
still
chagrined
over
the
evening
s
events
the
conversation
with
the
russian
interested
him
so
they
all
went
up
in
the
elevator
together
argensola
suggested
that
this
would
be
a
good
opportunity
to
uncork
one
of
the
many
bottles
which
he
was
keeping
in
the
kitchen
tchernoff
could
go
home
through
the
studio
door
that
opened
on
the
stairway
the
great
window
had
its
glass
doors
wide
open
the
transoms
on
the
patio
side
were
also
open
a
breeze
kept
the
curtains
swaying
moving
too
the
old
lanterns
flags
and
other
adornments
of
the
romantic
studio
they
seated
themselves
around
the
table
near
a
window
some
distance
from
the
light
which
was
illuminating
the
other
end
of
the
big
room
they
were
in
the
shadow
with
their
backs
to
the
interior
court
opposite
them
were
tiled
roofs
and
an
enormous
rectangle
of
blue
shadow
perforated
by
the
stars
the
city
lights
were
coloring
the
shadowy
space
with
a
bloody
reflection
tchernoff
drank
two
glasses
testifying
to
the
excellence
of
the
liquid
by
smacking
his
lips
the
three
were
silent
with
the
wondering
and
thoughtful
silence
which
the
grandeur
of
the
night
imposes
their
eyes
were
glancing
from
star
to
star
grouping
them
in
fanciful
lines
forming
them
into
triangles
or
squares
of
varying
irregularity
at
times
the
twinkling
radiance
of
a
heavenly
body
appeared
to
broaden
the
rays
of
light
almost
hypnotizing
them
the
russian
without
coming
out
of
his
revery
availed
himself
of
another
glass
then
he
smiled
with
cruel
irony
his
bearded
face
taking
on
the
semblance
of
a
tragic
mask
peeping
between
the
curtains
of
the
night
i
wonder
what
those
men
up
there
are
thinking
he
muttered
i
wonder
if
any
star
knows
that
bismarck
ever
existed
i
wonder
if
the
planets
are
aware
of
the
divine
mission
of
the
german
nation
and
he
continued
laughing
some
and
uncertain
noise
disturbed
the
stillness
of
the
night
slipping
through
some
of
the
chinks
that
cut
the
immense
plain
of
roofs
the
three
turned
their
heads
so
as
to
hear
better
the
sound
of
voices
cut
through
the
thick
silence
of
night
a
masculine
chorus
chanting
a
hymn
simple
monotonous
and
solemn
they
guessed
at
what
it
must
be
although
they
could
not
hear
very
well
various
single
notes
floating
with
greater
intensity
on
the
night
wind
enabled
argensola
to
piece
together
the
short
song
ending
in
a
melodious
triumphant
yell
a
true
war
song
c
est
l
alsace
et
la
lorraine
c
est
l
alsace
qu
il
nous
faut
oh
oh
oh
oh
a
new
band
of
men
was
going
away
through
the
streets
below
toward
the
railway
station
the
gateway
of
the
war
they
must
be
from
the
outlying
districts
perhaps
from
the
country
and
passing
through
paris
they
felt
like
singing
of
the
great
national
hope
that
those
who
were
watching
behind
the
dark
facades
might
feel
comforted
knowing
that
they
were
not
alone
just
as
it
is
in
the
opera
said
julio
listening
to
the
last
notes
of
the
invisible
chorus
dying
away
into
the
night
tchernoff
continued
drinking
but
with
a
distracted
air
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
red
cloud
that
floated
over
the
roofs
the
two
friends
conjectured
his
mental
labor
from
his
concentrated
look
and
the
low
exclamations
which
were
escaping
him
like
the
echoes
of
an
interior
monologue
suddenly
he
leaped
from
thought
to
word
without
any
forewarning
continuing
aloud
the
course
of
his
reasoning
and
when
the
sun
arises
in
a
few
hours
the
world
will
see
coursing
through
its
fields
the
four
horsemen
enemies
of
mankind
already
their
wild
steeds
are
pawing
the
ground
with
impatience
already
the
riders
have
come
together
and
are
exchanging
the
last
words
before
leaping
into
the
what
horsemen
are
these
asked
argensola
those
which
go
before
the
the
two
friends
thought
this
reply
as
unintelligible
as
the
preceding
words
desnoyers
again
said
mentally
he
is
drunk
but
his
curiosity
forced
him
to
ask
what
beast
is
that
that
of
the
there
was
a
brief
silence
but
the
russian
s
terseness
of
speech
did
not
last
long
he
felt
the
necessity
of
expressing
his
enthusiasm
for
the
dreamer
on
the
island
rock
of
patmos
the
poet
of
great
and
mystic
vision
was
exerting
across
two
thousand
years
his
influence
over
this
mysterious
revolutionary
tucked
away
on
the
top
floor
of
a
house
in
paris
john
had
foreseen
it
all
his
visions
unintelligible
to
the
masses
nevertheless
held
within
them
the
mystery
of
great
human
events
tchernoff
described
the
apocalyptic
beast
rising
from
the
depths
of
the
sea
he
was
like
a
leopard
his
feet
like
those
of
a
bear
his
mouth
like
the
snout
of
a
lion
he
had
seven
heads
and
ten
horns
and
upon
the
horns
were
ten
crowns
and
upon
each
of
his
heads
the
name
of
a
blasphemy
the
evangelist
did
not
say
just
what
these
blasphemies
were
perhaps
they
differed
according
to
the
epochs
modified
every
thousand
years
when
the
beast
made
a
new
apparition
the
russian
seemed
to
be
reading
those
that
were
flaming
on
the
heads
of
the
monster
blasphemies
against
humanity
against
justice
against
all
that
makes
life
sweet
and
bearable
might
is
superior
to
right
the
weak
should
not
be
harsh
in
order
to
be
and
the
beast
in
all
its
hideousness
was
attempting
to
govern
the
world
and
make
mankind
render
him
homage
but
the
four
horsemen
persisted
desnoyers
the
four
horsemen
were
preceding
the
appearance
of
the
monster
in
john
s
vision
the
seven
seals
of
the
book
of
mystery
were
broken
by
the
lamb
in
the
presence
of
the
great
throne
where
was
seated
one
who
shone
like
jasper
the
rainbow
round
about
the
throne
was
in
sight
like
unto
an
emerald
thrones
were
in
a
semicircle
around
the
great
throne
and
upon
them
elders
with
white
robes
and
crowns
of
gold
four
enormous
animals
covered
with
eyes
and
each
having
six
wings
seemed
to
be
guarding
the
throne
the
sounding
of
trumpets
was
greeting
the
breaking
of
the
first
seal
come
and
see
cried
one
of
the
beasts
in
a
stentorian
tone
to
the
poet
and
the
first
horseman
appeared
on
a
white
horse
in
his
hand
he
carried
a
bow
and
a
crown
was
given
unto
him
he
was
conquest
according
to
some
the
plague
according
to
others
he
might
be
both
things
at
the
same
time
he
wore
a
crown
and
that
was
enough
for
tchernoff
come
forth
shouted
the
second
animal
removing
his
thousand
eyes
and
from
the
broken
seal
leaped
a
steed
his
rider
brandished
over
his
head
an
enormous
sword
he
was
war
peace
fled
from
the
world
before
his
furious
gallop
humanity
was
going
to
be
exterminated
and
when
the
third
seal
was
broken
another
of
the
winged
animals
bellowed
like
a
thunder
clap
come
and
see
and
john
saw
a
black
horse
he
who
mounted
it
held
in
his
hand
a
scale
in
order
to
weigh
the
maintenance
of
mankind
he
was
famine
the
fourth
animal
saluted
the
breaking
of
the
fourth
seal
with
a
great
roaring
come
and
see
and
there
appeared
a
horse
his
rider
was
called
death
and
power
was
given
him
to
destroy
with
the
sword
and
with
hunger
and
with
death
and
with
the
beasts
of
the
earth
the
four
horsemen
were
beginning
their
mad
desolating
course
over
the
heads
of
terrified
humanity
tchernoff
was
describing
the
four
scourges
of
the
earth
exactly
as
though
he
were
seeing
them
the
horseman
on
the
white
horse
was
clad
in
a
showy
and
barbarous
attire
his
oriental
countenance
was
contracted
with
hatred
as
if
smelling
out
his
victims
while
his
horse
continued
galloping
he
was
bending
his
bow
in
order
to
spread
pestilence
abroad
at
his
back
swung
the
brass
quiver
filled
with
poisoned
arrows
containing
the
germs
of
all
diseases
those
of
private
life
as
well
as
those
which
envenom
the
wounded
soldier
on
the
battlefield
the
second
horseman
on
the
red
steed
was
waving
the
enormous
sword
over
his
hair
bristling
with
the
swiftness
of
his
course
he
was
young
but
the
fierce
scowl
and
the
scornful
mouth
gave
him
a
look
of
implacable
ferocity
his
garments
blown
open
by
the
motion
of
his
wild
race
disclosed
the
form
of
a
muscular
athlete
bald
old
and
horribly
skinny
was
the
third
horseman
bouncing
up
and
down
on
the
rawboned
back
of
his
black
steed
his
shrunken
legs
clanked
against
the
thin
flanks
of
the
lean
beast
in
one
withered
hand
he
was
holding
the
scales
symbol
of
the
scarcity
of
food
that
was
going
to
become
as
valuable
as
gold
the
knees
of
the
fourth
horseman
sharp
as
spurs
were
pricking
the
ribs
of
the
pale
horse
his
skin
betrayed
the
lines
and
hollows
of
his
skeleton
the
front
of
his
face
was
twisted
with
the
sardonic
laugh
of
destruction
his
arms
were
whirling
aloft
a
gigantic
sickle
from
his
angular
shoulders
was
hanging
a
ragged
filthy
shroud
and
the
furious
cavalcade
was
passing
like
a
hurricane
over
the
immense
assemblage
of
human
beings
the
heavens
showed
above
their
heads
a
livid
cloud
from
the
west
horrible
monsters
and
deformities
were
swarming
in
spirals
above
the
furious
horde
like
a
repulsive
escort
poor
humanity
crazed
with
fear
was
fleeing
in
all
directions
on
hearing
the
thundering
pace
of
the
plague
war
hunger
and
death
men
and
women
young
and
old
were
knocking
each
other
down
and
falling
to
the
ground
overwhelmed
by
terror
astonishment
and
desperation
and
the
white
horse
the
red
the
black
and
the
pale
were
crushing
all
with
their
relentless
iron
tread
the
athletic
man
was
hearing
the
crashing
of
his
broken
ribs
the
nursing
babe
was
writhing
at
its
mother
s
breast
and
the
aged
and
feeble
were
closing
their
eyes
forever
with
a
childlike
sob
god
is
asleep
forgetting
the
world
continued
the
russian
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
he
awakes
and
while
he
sleeps
the
four
feudal
horsemen
of
the
beast
will
course
through
the
land
as
its
only
tchernoff
was
overpowered
by
the
intensity
of
his
dramatic
vision
springing
from
his
seat
he
paced
up
and
down
with
great
strides
but
his
picture
of
the
fourfold
catastrophe
revealed
by
the
gloomy
poet
s
trance
seemed
to
him
very
weak
indeed
a
great
painter
had
given
corporeal
form
to
these
terrible
dreams
i
have
a
book
he
murmured
a
rare
and
suddenly
he
left
the
studio
and
went
to
his
own
quarters
he
wanted
to
bring
the
book
to
show
to
his
friends
argensola
accompanied
him
and
they
returned
in
a
few
minutes
with
the
volume
leaving
the
doors
open
behind
them
so
as
to
make
a
stronger
current
of
air
among
the
hollows
of
the
facades
and
the
interior
patio
tchernoff
placed
his
precious
book
under
the
light
it
was
a
volume
printed
in
with
latin
text
and
engravings
desnoyers
read
the
title
the
apocalypse
the
engravings
were
by
albert
durer
a
youthful
effort
when
the
master
was
only
years
old
the
three
were
fascinated
by
the
picture
portraying
the
wild
career
of
the
apocalyptic
horsemen
the
quadruple
scourge
on
fantastic
mounts
seemed
to
be
precipitating
itself
with
a
realistic
sweep
crushing
humanity
suddenly
something
happened
which
startled
the
three
men
from
their
contemplative
admiration
something
unusual
indefinable
a
dreadful
sound
which
seemed
to
enter
directly
into
their
brains
without
passing
through
their
ears
a
clutch
at
the
heart
instinctively
they
knew
that
something
very
grave
had
just
happened
they
stared
at
each
other
silently
for
a
few
interminable
seconds
through
the
open
door
a
cry
of
alarm
came
up
from
the
patio
with
a
common
impulse
the
three
ran
to
the
interior
window
but
before
reaching
them
the
russian
had
a
presentiment
my
neighbor
it
must
be
my
neighbor
perhaps
she
has
killed
herself
looking
down
they
could
see
lights
below
people
moving
around
a
form
stretched
out
on
the
tiled
floor
the
alarm
had
instantly
filled
all
the
court
windows
for
it
was
a
sleepless
night
a
night
of
nervous
apprehension
when
everyone
was
keeping
a
sad
vigil
she
has
killed
herself
said
a
voice
which
seemed
to
come
up
from
a
well
the
german
woman
has
committed
the
explanation
of
the
concierge
leaped
from
window
to
window
up
to
the
top
floor
the
russian
was
shaking
his
head
with
a
fatalistic
expression
the
unhappy
woman
had
not
taken
the
of
her
own
accord
someone
had
intensified
her
desperation
someone
had
pushed
her
the
horsemen
the
four
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
already
they
were
in
the
saddle
already
they
were
beginning
their
merciless
gallop
of
destruction
the
blind
forces
of
evil
were
about
to
be
let
loose
throughout
the
world
the
agony
of
humanity
under
the
brutal
sweep
of
the
four
horsemen
was
already
begun
part
ii
chapter
i
what
don
marcelo
envied
upon
being
convinced
that
war
really
was
inevitable
the
elder
desnoyers
was
filled
with
amazement
humanity
had
gone
crazy
was
it
possible
that
war
could
happen
in
these
days
of
so
many
railroads
so
many
merchant
marines
so
many
inventions
so
much
activity
developed
above
and
below
the
earth
the
nations
would
ruin
themselves
forever
they
were
now
accustomed
to
luxuries
and
necessities
unknown
a
century
ago
capital
was
master
of
the
world
and
war
was
going
to
wipe
it
out
in
its
turn
war
would
be
wiped
out
in
a
few
months
time
through
lack
of
funds
to
sustain
it
his
soul
of
a
business
man
revolted
before
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
millions
that
this
foolhardy
event
was
going
to
convert
into
smoke
and
slaughter
as
his
indignation
had
to
fix
upon
something
close
at
hand
he
made
his
own
countrymen
responsible
for
this
insanity
too
much
talk
about
la
revanche
the
very
idea
of
worrying
for
years
over
the
two
lost
provinces
when
the
nation
was
mistress
of
enormous
and
undeveloped
lands
in
other
countries
now
they
were
going
to
pay
the
penalty
for
such
exasperating
and
clamorous
foolishness
for
him
war
meant
disaster
writ
large
he
had
no
faith
in
his
country
france
s
day
had
passed
now
the
victors
were
of
the
northern
peoples
and
especially
that
germany
which
he
had
seen
so
close
admiring
with
a
certain
terror
its
discipline
and
its
rigorous
organization
the
former
felt
the
conservative
and
selfish
instinct
of
all
those
who
have
amassed
millions
he
scorned
political
ideals
but
through
class
interest
he
had
of
late
years
accepted
the
declarations
against
the
scandals
of
the
government
what
could
a
corrupt
and
disorganized
republic
do
against
the
solidest
and
strongest
empire
in
the
world
we
are
going
to
our
deaths
he
said
to
himself
worse
than
we
are
going
to
see
horrible
things
the
good
order
and
enthusiasm
with
which
the
french
responded
to
their
country
s
call
and
transformed
themselves
into
soldiers
were
most
astonishing
to
him
this
moral
shock
made
his
national
faith
begin
to
revive
the
great
majority
of
frenchmen
were
good
after
all
the
nation
was
as
valiant
as
in
former
times
years
of
suffering
and
alarm
had
developed
their
old
bravery
but
the
leaders
where
were
they
going
to
get
leaders
to
march
to
victory
many
others
were
asking
themselves
the
same
question
the
silence
of
the
democratic
government
was
keeping
the
country
in
complete
ignorance
of
their
future
commanders
everybody
saw
the
army
increasing
from
hour
to
hour
very
few
knew
the
generals
one
name
was
beginning
to
be
repeated
from
mouth
to
mouth
joffre
his
first
pictures
made
the
curious
crowds
struggle
to
get
a
glimpse
of
them
desnoyers
studied
them
very
carefully
he
looks
like
a
very
capable
his
methodical
instincts
were
gratified
by
the
grave
and
confident
look
of
the
general
of
the
republic
suddenly
he
felt
the
great
confidence
that
bank
directors
always
inspired
in
him
he
could
entrust
his
interests
to
this
gentleman
sure
that
he
would
not
act
impulsively
finally
against
his
will
desnoyers
was
drawn
into
the
whirlpool
of
enthusiasm
and
emotion
like
everyone
around
him
he
lived
minutes
that
were
hours
and
hours
that
were
years
events
kept
on
overlapping
each
other
within
a
week
the
world
seemed
to
have
made
up
for
its
long
period
of
peace
the
old
man
fairly
lived
in
the
street
attracted
by
the
spectacle
of
the
multitude
of
civilians
saluting
the
multitude
of
uniformed
men
departing
for
the
seat
of
war
at
night
he
saw
the
processions
passing
through
the
boulevards
the
tricolored
flag
was
fluttering
its
colors
under
the
electric
lights
the
cafes
were
overflowing
with
people
sending
forth
from
doors
and
windows
the
excited
musical
notes
of
patriotic
songs
suddenly
amidst
applause
and
cheers
the
crowd
would
make
an
opening
in
the
street
all
europe
was
passing
here
all
europe
less
the
arrogant
enemy
and
was
saluting
france
in
her
hour
of
danger
with
hearty
spontaneity
flags
of
different
nations
were
filing
by
of
all
tints
of
the
rainbow
and
behind
them
were
the
russians
with
bright
and
mystical
eyes
the
english
with
heads
uncovered
intoning
songs
of
religious
gravity
the
greeks
and
roumanians
of
aquiline
profile
the
scandinavians
white
and
red
the
north
americans
with
the
noisiness
of
a
somewhat
puerile
enthusiasm
the
hebrews
without
a
country
friends
of
the
nation
of
socialistic
revolutions
the
italians
as
spirited
as
a
choir
of
heroic
tenors
the
spanish
and
south
americans
tireless
in
their
huzzas
they
were
students
and
apprentices
who
were
completing
their
courses
in
the
schools
and
workshops
and
refugees
who
like
shipwrecked
mariners
had
sought
shelter
on
the
hospitable
strand
of
paris
their
cheers
had
no
special
significance
but
they
were
all
moved
by
their
desire
to
show
their
love
for
the
republic
and
desnoyers
touched
by
the
sight
felt
that
france
was
still
of
some
account
in
the
world
that
she
yet
exercised
a
moral
force
among
the
nations
and
that
her
joys
and
sorrows
were
still
of
interest
to
humanity
in
berlin
and
vienna
too
he
said
to
himself
they
must
also
be
cheering
enthusiastically
at
this
moment
but
germans
only
no
others
assuredly
no
foreigner
is
joining
in
their
the
nation
of
the
revolution
legislator
of
the
rights
of
mankind
was
harvesting
the
gratitude
of
the
throngs
but
was
beginning
to
feel
a
certain
remorse
before
the
enthusiasm
of
the
foreigners
who
were
offering
their
blood
for
france
many
were
lamenting
that
the
government
should
delay
twenty
days
until
after
they
had
finished
the
operations
of
mobilization
in
admitting
the
volunteers
and
he
a
frenchman
born
a
few
hours
before
had
been
mistrusting
his
country
in
the
daytime
the
popular
current
was
running
toward
the
gare
de
l
est
crowded
against
the
gratings
was
a
surging
mass
of
humanity
stretching
its
tentacles
through
the
nearby
streets
the
station
that
was
acquiring
the
importance
of
a
historic
spot
appeared
like
a
narrow
tunnel
through
which
a
great
human
river
was
trying
to
flow
with
many
rippling
encounters
and
much
heavy
pressure
against
its
banks
a
large
part
of
france
in
arms
was
coursing
through
this
exit
from
paris
toward
the
battlefields
at
the
frontier
desnoyers
had
been
in
the
station
only
twice
when
going
and
coming
from
germany
others
were
now
taking
the
same
road
the
crowds
were
swarming
in
from
the
environs
of
the
city
in
order
to
see
the
masses
of
human
beings
in
geometric
bodies
uniformly
clad
disappearing
within
the
entrance
with
flash
of
steel
and
the
rhythm
of
clanking
metal
the
crystal
archways
that
were
glistening
in
the
sun
like
fiery
mouths
were
swallowing
and
swallowing
people
when
night
fell
the
processions
were
still
coming
on
by
light
of
the
electric
lamps
through
the
iron
grills
were
passing
thousands
and
thousands
of
draught
horses
men
with
their
breasts
crossed
with
metal
and
bunches
of
horsehair
hanging
from
their
helmets
like
paladins
of
bygone
centuries
enormous
cases
that
were
serving
as
cages
for
the
aeronautic
condors
strings
of
cannon
long
and
narrow
painted
grey
and
protected
by
metal
screens
more
like
astronomical
instruments
than
mouths
of
death
masses
and
masses
of
red
kepis
military
caps
moving
in
marching
rhythm
rows
and
rows
of
muskets
some
black
and
stark
like
reed
plantations
others
ending
in
bayonets
like
shining
spikes
and
over
all
these
restless
fields
of
seething
throngs
the
flags
of
the
regiments
were
fluttering
in
the
air
like
colored
birds
a
white
body
a
blue
wing
or
a
red
one
a
cravat
of
gold
on
the
neck
and
above
the
metal
tip
pointing
toward
the
clouds
don
marcelo
would
return
home
from
these
vibrating
with
nervous
fatigue
as
one
who
had
just
participated
in
a
scene
of
racking
emotion
in
spite
of
his
tenacious
character
which
always
stood
out
against
admitting
a
mistake
the
old
man
began
to
feel
ashamed
of
his
former
doubts
the
nation
was
quivering
with
life
france
was
a
grand
nation
appearances
had
deceived
him
as
well
as
many
others
perhaps
the
most
of
his
countrymen
were
of
a
light
and
flippant
character
given
to
excessive
interest
in
the
sensuous
side
of
life
but
when
danger
came
they
were
fulfilling
their
duty
simply
without
the
necessity
of
the
harsh
force
to
which
the
organizations
were
submitting
their
people
on
leaving
home
on
the
morning
of
the
fourth
day
of
the
mobilization
desnoyers
instead
of
betaking
himself
to
the
centre
of
the
city
went
in
the
opposite
direction
toward
the
rue
de
la
pompe
some
imprudent
words
dropped
by
chichi
and
the
uneasy
looks
of
his
wife
and
made
him
suspect
that
julio
had
returned
from
his
trip
he
felt
the
necessity
of
seeing
at
least
the
outside
of
the
studio
windows
as
if
they
might
give
him
news
and
in
order
to
justify
a
trip
so
at
variance
with
his
policy
of
ignoring
his
son
he
remembered
that
the
carpenter
lived
in
the
same
street
i
must
hunt
up
robert
he
promised
a
week
ago
that
he
would
come
this
robert
was
a
husky
young
fellow
who
to
use
his
own
words
was
emancipated
from
boss
tyranny
and
was
working
independently
in
his
own
home
a
tiny
almost
subterranean
room
was
serving
him
for
dwelling
and
workshop
a
woman
he
called
my
affinity
was
looking
carefully
after
his
hearth
and
home
with
a
baby
boy
clinging
to
her
skirts
desnoyers
was
accustomed
to
humor
robert
s
tirades
against
his
fellow
citizens
because
the
man
had
always
humored
his
whimseys
about
the
incessant
rearrangement
of
his
furniture
in
the
luxurious
apartment
in
the
avenue
victor
hugo
the
carpenter
would
sing
la
internacional
while
using
hammer
and
saw
and
his
employer
would
overlook
his
audacity
of
speech
because
of
the
cheapness
of
his
work
upon
arriving
at
the
shop
he
found
the
man
with
cap
over
one
ear
broad
trousers
like
a
mameluke
s
hobnailed
boots
and
various
pennants
and
rosettes
fastened
to
the
lapels
of
his
jacket
you
ve
come
too
late
boss
he
said
cheerily
i
am
just
going
to
close
the
factory
the
proprietor
has
been
mobilized
and
in
a
few
hours
will
join
his
and
he
pointed
to
a
written
paper
posted
on
the
door
of
his
dwelling
like
the
printed
cards
on
all
establishments
signifying
that
employer
and
employees
had
obeyed
the
order
of
mobilization
it
had
never
occurred
to
desnoyers
that
his
carpenter
might
become
a
soldier
since
he
was
so
opposed
to
all
kinds
of
authority
he
hated
the
flics
the
paris
police
with
whom
he
had
more
than
once
exchanged
fisticuffs
and
clubbings
militarism
was
his
special
aversion
in
the
meetings
against
the
despotism
of
the
barracks
he
had
always
been
one
of
the
noisiest
participants
and
was
this
revolutionary
fellow
going
to
war
naturally
and
voluntarily
robert
spoke
enthusiastically
of
his
regiment
of
life
among
comrades
with
death
but
four
steps
away
i
believe
in
my
ideas
boss
the
same
as
before
he
explained
as
though
guessing
the
other
s
thought
but
war
is
war
and
teaches
many
things
among
others
that
liberty
must
be
accompanied
with
order
and
authority
it
is
necessary
that
someone
direct
that
the
rest
may
follow
willingly
by
common
consent
but
they
must
follow
when
war
actually
comes
one
sees
things
very
differently
from
when
living
at
home
doing
as
one
the
night
that
they
assassinated
jaures
he
howled
with
rage
announcing
that
the
following
morning
the
murder
would
be
avenged
he
had
hunted
up
his
associates
in
the
district
in
order
to
inform
them
what
retaliation
was
being
planned
against
the
malefactors
but
war
was
about
to
break
out
there
was
something
in
the
air
that
was
opposing
civil
strife
that
was
placing
private
grievances
in
momentary
abeyance
concentrating
all
minds
on
the
common
weal
a
week
ago
he
exclaimed
i
was
an
how
far
away
that
seems
now
as
if
a
year
had
gone
by
i
keep
thinking
as
before
i
love
peace
and
hate
war
like
all
my
comrades
but
the
french
have
not
offended
anybody
and
yet
they
threaten
us
wishing
to
enslave
us
but
we
french
can
be
fierce
since
they
oblige
us
to
be
and
in
order
to
defend
ourselves
it
is
just
that
nobody
should
shirk
that
all
should
obey
discipline
does
not
quarrel
with
revolution
remember
the
armies
of
the
first
republic
all
citizens
generals
as
well
as
soldiers
but
hoche
kleber
and
the
others
were
unpolished
benefactors
who
knew
how
to
command
and
exact
the
carpenter
was
well
read
besides
the
papers
and
pamphlets
of
the
idea
he
had
also
read
on
stray
sheets
the
views
of
michelet
and
other
liberal
actors
on
the
stage
of
history
we
are
going
to
make
war
on
war
he
added
we
are
going
to
fight
so
that
this
war
will
be
the
this
statement
did
not
seem
to
be
expressed
with
sufficient
clearness
so
he
recast
his
thought
we
are
going
to
fight
for
the
future
we
are
going
to
die
in
order
that
our
grandchildren
may
not
have
to
endure
a
similar
calamity
if
the
enemy
triumphs
the
will
triumph
and
conquest
will
be
the
only
means
of
growth
first
they
will
overcome
europe
then
the
rest
of
the
world
later
on
those
who
have
been
pillaged
will
rise
up
in
their
wrath
more
wars
we
do
not
want
conquests
we
desire
to
regain
alsace
and
lorraine
for
their
inhabitants
wish
to
return
to
us
and
nothing
more
we
shall
not
imitate
the
enemy
appropriating
territory
and
jeopardizing
the
peace
of
the
world
we
had
enough
of
that
with
napoleon
we
must
not
repeat
that
experience
we
are
going
to
fight
for
our
immediate
security
and
at
the
same
time
for
the
security
of
the
world
for
the
life
of
the
weaker
nations
if
this
were
a
war
of
aggression
of
mere
vanity
of
conquest
then
we
socialists
would
bethink
ourselves
of
our
but
this
is
and
the
government
has
not
been
at
fault
since
we
are
attacked
we
must
be
united
in
our
the
carpenter
who
was
also
was
now
showing
a
more
generous
tolerance
an
amplitude
of
ideas
that
embraced
all
mankind
the
day
before
he
had
met
at
the
administration
office
a
reservist
who
was
just
leaving
to
join
his
regiment
at
a
glance
he
saw
that
this
man
was
a
priest
i
am
a
carpenter
he
had
said
to
him
by
way
of
introduction
and
you
comrade
are
working
in
the
churches
he
employed
this
figure
of
speech
in
order
that
the
priest
might
not
suspect
him
of
anything
offensive
the
two
had
clasped
hands
i
do
not
take
much
stock
in
the
clerical
cowl
robert
explained
to
desnoyers
for
some
time
i
have
not
been
on
friendly
terms
with
religion
but
in
every
walk
of
life
there
must
be
good
people
and
the
good
people
ought
to
understand
each
other
in
a
crisis
like
this
don
t
you
think
so
boss
the
war
coincided
with
his
socialistic
tendencies
before
this
when
speaking
of
future
revolution
he
had
felt
a
malign
pleasure
in
imagining
all
the
rich
deprived
of
their
fortunes
and
having
to
work
in
order
to
exist
now
he
was
equally
enthusiastic
at
the
thought
that
all
frenchmen
would
share
the
same
fate
without
class
distinction
all
with
knapsacks
on
their
backs
and
eating
at
and
he
was
even
extending
this
military
sobriety
to
those
who
remained
behind
the
army
war
was
going
to
cause
great
scarcity
of
provisions
and
all
would
have
to
come
down
to
very
plain
fare
you
too
boss
who
are
too
old
to
go
to
war
you
with
all
your
millions
will
have
to
eat
the
same
as
admit
that
it
is
a
beautiful
desnoyers
was
not
offended
by
the
malicious
satisfaction
that
his
future
privations
seemed
to
inspire
in
the
carpenter
he
was
very
thoughtful
a
man
of
his
stamp
an
enemy
of
existing
conditions
who
had
no
property
to
defend
was
going
to
war
to
death
perhaps
because
of
a
generous
and
distant
ideal
in
order
that
future
generations
might
never
know
the
actual
horrors
of
war
to
do
this
he
was
not
hesitating
at
the
sacrifice
of
his
former
cherished
beliefs
all
that
he
had
held
sacred
till
now
and
he
who
belonged
to
the
privileged
class
who
possessed
so
many
tempting
things
requiring
defense
had
given
himself
up
to
doubt
and
criticism
hours
after
he
again
saw
the
carpenter
near
the
arc
de
triomphe
he
was
one
of
a
group
of
workmen
looking
much
as
he
did
and
this
group
was
joining
others
and
still
others
that
represented
every
social
class
citizens
stylish
and
anaemic
young
men
graduate
students
with
worn
jackets
pale
faces
and
thick
glasses
and
youthful
priests
who
were
smiling
rather
shamefacedly
as
though
they
had
been
caught
at
some
ridiculous
escapade
at
the
head
of
this
human
herd
was
a
sergeant
and
as
a
rear
guard
various
soldiers
with
guns
on
their
shoulders
forward
march
reservists
and
a
musical
cry
a
solemn
harmony
like
a
greek
chant
menacing
and
monotonous
surged
up
from
this
mass
with
open
mouths
swinging
arms
and
legs
that
were
opening
and
shutting
like
compasses
robert
was
singing
the
martial
chorus
with
such
great
energy
that
his
eyes
and
gallic
moustachios
were
fairly
trembling
in
spite
of
his
corduroy
suit
and
his
bulging
linen
hand
bag
he
had
the
same
grand
and
heroic
aspect
as
the
figures
by
rude
in
the
arc
de
triomphe
the
affinity
and
the
boy
were
trudging
along
the
sidewalk
so
as
to
accompany
him
to
the
station
for
a
moment
he
took
his
eyes
from
them
to
speak
with
a
companion
in
the
line
shaven
and
undoubtedly
the
priest
whom
he
had
met
the
day
before
now
they
were
talking
confidentially
intimately
with
that
brotherliness
which
contact
with
death
inspires
in
mankind
the
millionaire
followed
the
carpenter
with
a
look
of
respect
immeasurably
increased
since
he
had
taken
his
part
in
this
human
avalanche
and
this
respect
had
in
it
something
of
envy
the
envy
that
springs
from
an
uneasy
conscience
whenever
don
marcelo
passed
a
bad
night
suffering
from
nightmare
a
certain
terrible
thing
always
the
same
would
torment
his
imagination
rarely
did
he
dream
of
mortal
peril
to
his
family
or
self
the
frightful
vision
was
always
that
certain
notes
bearing
his
signature
were
presented
for
collection
which
he
marcelo
desnoyers
the
man
always
faithful
to
his
bond
with
a
past
of
immaculate
probity
was
not
able
to
pay
such
a
possibility
made
him
tremble
and
long
after
waking
his
heart
would
be
oppressed
with
terror
to
his
imagination
this
was
the
greatest
disgrace
that
a
man
could
suffer
now
that
war
was
overturning
his
existence
with
its
agitations
the
same
agonies
were
reappearing
completely
awake
with
full
powers
of
reasoning
he
was
suffering
exactly
the
same
distress
as
when
in
his
horrible
dreams
he
saw
his
dishonored
signature
on
a
protested
document
all
his
past
was
looming
up
before
his
eyes
with
such
extraordinary
clearness
that
it
seemed
as
though
until
then
his
mind
must
have
been
in
hopeless
confusion
the
threatened
land
of
france
was
his
native
country
fifteen
centuries
of
history
had
been
working
for
him
in
order
that
his
opening
eyes
might
survey
progress
and
comforts
that
his
ancestors
did
not
even
know
many
generations
of
desnoyers
had
prepared
for
his
advent
into
life
by
struggling
with
the
land
and
defending
it
that
he
might
be
born
into
a
free
family
and
fireside
and
when
his
turn
had
come
for
continuing
this
effort
when
his
time
had
arrived
in
the
rosary
of
generations
he
had
fled
like
a
debtor
evading
payment
on
coming
into
his
fatherland
he
had
contracted
obligations
with
the
human
group
to
whom
he
owed
his
existence
this
obligation
should
be
paid
with
his
arms
with
any
sacrifice
that
would
repel
danger
and
he
had
eluded
the
acknowledgment
of
his
signature
fleeing
his
country
and
betraying
his
trust
to
his
forefathers
ah
miserable
coward
the
material
success
of
his
life
the
riches
acquired
in
a
remote
country
were
comparatively
of
no
importance
there
are
failures
that
millions
can
not
blot
out
the
uneasiness
of
his
conscience
was
proving
it
now
proof
too
was
in
the
envy
and
respect
inspired
by
this
poor
mechanic
marching
to
meet
his
death
with
others
equally
humble
all
kindled
with
the
satisfaction
of
duty
fulfilled
of
sacrifice
accepted
the
memory
of
madariaga
came
to
his
memory
where
we
make
our
riches
and
found
a
family
there
is
our
no
the
statement
of
the
centaur
was
not
correct
in
normal
times
perhaps
far
from
one
s
native
land
when
it
is
not
exposed
to
danger
one
may
forget
it
for
a
few
years
but
he
was
living
now
in
france
and
france
was
being
obliged
to
defend
herself
against
enemies
wishing
to
overpower
her
the
sight
of
all
her
people
rising
en
masse
was
becoming
an
increasingly
shameful
torture
for
desnoyers
making
him
think
all
the
time
of
what
he
should
have
done
in
his
youth
of
what
he
had
dodged
the
veterans
of
were
passing
through
the
streets
with
the
green
and
black
ribbon
in
their
lapel
souvenirs
of
the
privations
of
the
siege
of
paris
and
of
heroic
and
disastrous
campaigns
the
sight
of
these
men
satisfied
with
their
past
made
him
turn
pale
nobody
was
recalling
his
but
he
knew
it
and
that
was
enough
in
vain
his
reason
would
try
to
lull
this
interior
tempest
those
times
were
different
then
there
was
none
of
the
present
unanimity
the
empire
was
unpopular
everything
was
lost
but
the
recollection
of
a
celebrated
sentence
was
fixing
itself
in
his
mind
as
an
obsession
france
still
remained
many
had
thought
as
he
did
in
his
youth
but
they
had
not
therefore
evaded
military
service
they
had
stood
by
their
country
in
a
last
and
desperate
resistance
useless
was
his
reasoning
nobler
thoughts
showed
him
the
fallacy
of
this
beating
around
the
bush
explanations
and
demonstrations
are
unnecessary
to
the
understanding
of
patriotic
and
religious
ideals
true
patriotism
does
not
need
them
one
s
country
is
one
s
country
and
the
laboring
man
skeptical
and
jesting
the
farmer
the
solitary
pastor
all
had
sprung
to
action
at
the
sound
of
this
conjuring
word
comprehending
it
instantly
without
previous
instruction
it
is
necessary
to
pay
don
marcelo
kept
repeating
mentally
i
ought
to
pay
my
as
in
his
dreams
he
was
constantly
feeling
the
anguish
of
an
upright
and
desperate
man
who
wishes
to
meet
his
obligations
pay
and
how
it
was
now
very
late
for
a
moment
the
heroic
resolution
came
into
his
head
of
offering
himself
as
a
volunteer
of
marching
with
his
bag
at
his
side
in
some
one
of
the
groups
of
future
combatants
the
same
as
the
carpenter
but
the
uselessness
of
the
sacrifice
came
immediately
into
his
mind
of
what
use
would
it
be
he
looked
robust
and
was
for
his
age
but
he
was
over
seventy
and
only
the
young
make
good
soldiers
combat
is
but
one
incident
in
the
struggle
equally
necessary
are
the
hardship
and
in
the
form
of
interminable
marches
extremes
of
temperature
nights
in
the
open
air
shoveling
earth
digging
trenches
loading
carts
suffering
hunger
no
it
was
too
late
he
could
not
even
leave
an
illustrious
name
that
might
serve
as
an
example
instinctively
he
glanced
behind
he
was
not
alone
in
the
world
he
had
a
son
who
could
assume
his
father
s
debt
but
that
hope
only
lasted
a
minute
his
son
was
not
french
he
belonged
to
another
people
half
of
his
blood
was
from
another
source
besides
how
could
the
boy
be
expected
to
feel
as
he
did
would
he
even
understand
if
his
father
should
explain
it
to
him
it
was
useless
to
expect
anything
from
this
dancing
clown
from
this
fellow
of
senseless
bravado
who
was
constantly
exposing
his
life
in
duels
in
order
to
satisfy
a
silly
sense
of
honor
oh
the
meekness
of
the
bluff
senor
desnoyers
after
these
reflections
his
family
felt
alarmed
at
seeing
the
humility
and
gentleness
with
which
he
moved
around
the
house
the
two
had
gone
to
join
their
regiments
and
to
them
the
most
surprising
result
of
the
declaration
of
war
was
the
sudden
kindness
of
their
master
the
lavishness
of
his
farewell
gifts
the
paternal
care
with
which
he
supervised
their
preparations
for
departure
the
terrible
don
marcelo
embraced
them
with
moist
eyes
and
the
two
had
to
exert
themselves
to
prevent
his
accompanying
them
to
the
station
outside
of
his
home
he
was
slipping
about
humbly
as
though
mutely
asking
pardon
of
the
many
people
around
him
to
him
they
all
appeared
his
superiors
it
was
a
period
of
economic
crisis
for
the
time
being
the
rich
also
were
experiencing
what
it
was
to
be
poor
and
worried
the
banks
had
suspended
operations
and
were
paying
only
a
small
part
of
their
deposits
for
some
weeks
the
millionaire
was
deprived
of
his
wealth
and
felt
restless
before
the
uncertain
future
how
long
would
it
be
before
they
could
send
him
money
from
south
america
was
war
going
to
take
away
fortunes
as
well
as
lives
and
yet
desnoyers
had
never
appreciated
money
less
nor
disposed
of
it
with
greater
generosity
numberless
mobilized
men
of
the
lower
classes
who
were
going
alone
toward
the
station
met
a
gentleman
who
would
timidly
stop
them
put
his
hand
in
his
pocket
and
leave
in
their
right
hand
a
bill
of
twenty
francs
fleeing
immediately
before
their
astonished
eyes
the
who
were
returning
weeping
from
saying
to
their
husbands
saw
this
same
gentleman
smiling
at
the
children
who
were
with
them
patting
their
cheeks
and
hastening
away
leaving
a
piece
in
their
hands
don
marcelo
who
had
never
smoked
was
now
frequenting
the
tobacco
shops
coming
out
with
hands
and
pockets
filled
in
order
that
he
might
with
lavish
generosity
press
the
packages
upon
the
first
soldier
he
met
at
times
the
recipient
smiling
courteously
would
thank
him
with
a
few
words
revealing
his
superior
breeding
afterwards
passing
the
gift
on
to
others
clad
in
cloaks
as
coarse
and
badly
cut
as
his
own
the
mobilization
universally
obligatory
often
caused
him
to
make
these
mistakes
the
rough
hands
pressing
his
with
a
grateful
clasp
left
him
satisfied
for
a
few
moments
ah
if
he
could
only
do
more
the
government
in
mobilizing
its
vehicles
had
appropriated
three
of
his
monumental
automobiles
and
desnoyers
felt
very
sorry
that
they
were
not
also
taking
the
fourth
mastodon
of
what
use
were
they
to
him
the
shepherds
of
this
monstrous
herd
the
chauffeur
and
his
assistants
were
now
in
the
army
everybody
was
marching
away
finally
he
and
his
son
would
be
the
only
ones
left
two
useless
creatures
he
roared
with
wrath
on
learning
of
the
enemy
s
entrance
into
belgium
considering
this
the
most
treason
in
history
he
suffered
agonies
of
shame
at
remembering
that
at
first
he
had
held
the
exalted
patriots
of
his
country
responsible
for
the
war
what
perfidy
methodically
carried
out
after
long
years
of
preparation
the
accounts
of
the
sackings
fires
and
butcheries
made
him
turn
pale
and
gnash
his
teeth
to
him
to
marcelo
desnoyers
might
happen
the
very
same
thing
that
belgium
was
enduring
if
the
barbarians
should
invade
france
he
had
a
home
in
the
city
a
castle
in
the
country
and
a
family
through
association
of
ideas
the
women
assaulted
by
the
soldiery
made
him
think
of
chichi
and
the
dear
dona
luisa
the
mansions
in
flames
called
to
his
mind
the
rare
and
costly
furnishings
accumulated
in
his
expensive
dwellings
the
armorial
bearings
of
his
social
elevation
the
old
folk
that
were
shot
the
women
foully
mutilated
the
children
with
their
hands
cut
off
all
the
horrors
of
a
war
of
terror
aroused
the
violence
of
his
character
and
such
things
could
happen
with
impunity
in
this
day
and
generation
in
order
to
convince
himself
that
punishment
was
near
that
vengeance
was
overtaking
the
guilty
ones
he
felt
the
necessity
of
mingling
daily
with
the
people
crowding
around
the
gare
de
l
est
although
the
greater
part
of
the
troops
were
operating
on
the
frontiers
that
was
not
diminishing
the
activity
in
paris
entire
battalions
were
no
longer
going
off
but
day
and
night
soldiers
were
coming
to
the
station
singly
or
in
groups
these
were
reserves
without
uniform
on
their
way
to
enroll
themselves
with
their
companies
officials
who
until
then
had
been
busy
with
the
work
of
the
mobilization
platoons
in
arms
destined
to
fill
the
great
gaps
opened
by
death
the
multitude
pressed
against
the
railing
was
greeting
those
who
were
going
off
following
them
with
their
eyes
while
they
were
crossing
the
large
square
the
latest
editions
of
the
daily
papers
were
announced
with
hoarse
yells
and
instantly
the
dark
throng
would
be
spotted
with
white

reading

avidity

and
while
these
dialogues
inspired
by
the
latest
news
were
taking
place
many
young
girls
were
going
among
the
groups
offering
little
flags
and
tricolored
cockades
and
passing
through
the
patio
men
and
still
more
men
were
disappearing
behind
the
glass
doors
on
their
way
to
the

a
of
the

with
his
bag
on
his

was
accompanied
by

toward

of
policemen
keeping
the

desnoyers
saw
in
the
young
officer
a
certain
resemblance
to
his
son
the
father
was
wearing
in
his
lapel
the
black
and
green
ribbon
of
a
decoration
which
always
filled
desnoyers
with
remorse
he
was
tall
and
gaunt
but
was
still
trying
to
hold
himself
erect
with
a
heavy
frown
he
wanted
to
show
himself
fierce
inhuman
in

to
hide
his
emotion

did
not
clasp
hands
and
each
was
avoiding
looking
at

the
official
was
smiling
like
an
automaton
the
father
turned
his
back
brusquely
and
threading
his
way
through
the
throng
entered
a
cafe
where
for
some
time
he
needed
the
most
retired
seat
in
the
darkest
earner
to
hide
his
emotion
and
don
marcelo
envied
his
grief
some
of
the
reservists
came
along
singing
preceded
by
a
flag
they
were
joking
and
jostling
each
other
betraying
in
excited
actions
long
halts
at
all
the
taverns
along
the
way
one
of
them
without
interrupting
his
song
was
pressing
the
hand
of
an
old
woman
marching
beside
him
cheerful
and
the
mother
was
concentrating
all
her
strength
in
order
with
feigned
happiness
to
accompany
this
strapping
lad
to
the
last
minute
others
were
coming
along
singly
separated
from

but
not
on

the

was
hanging
from

by

shooting
in

of

four
children
were
walking
along
lined
up
according
to

they
kept
turning
their
heads
to
admire
their
father
suddenly
glorified
by
his
military
trappings
at
his
side
was
marching
his

affable
and

in

a

who
a

singing

demanding
the
abolishment
of

and
the
brotherhood
of
all
mankind
was
now
going
in
quest
of

his
wife
choking
back
her
sobs
was
admiring
him
greatly
affection
and
commiseration
made
her
insist
upon
giving
him
a
few
last
counsels
in
his
knapsack
she
had
put
his
best
handkerchiefs
the
few

in

the

in

was
jesting
over
the
somewhat
misshapen
figure
of
his

saluting
the
coming
citizen
and
prophesying
that

would
be

many

grasped

convulsively
many

chapter

new
life
when
marguerite
was
able
to
return
to
the
studio
in
the
rue
de
la
pompe
julio
who
had
been
living
in
a
perpetual
bad
humor
seeing
everything
in
the
blackest
colors
suddenly
felt
a
return
of
his
old
optimism
the
war
was
not
going
to
be
so
cruel
as
they
all
had
at
first
imagined
the
days
had
passed
by
and
the
movements
of
the
troops
were
beginning
to
be
less
noticeable
as
the
number
of
men
diminished
in
the
streets
the
feminine
population
seemed
to
have
increased
although
there
was
great
scarcity
of
money
the
banks
still
remaining
closed
the
necessity
for
it
was
increasingly
great
in
order
to
secure
provisions
memories
of
the
famine
of
the
siege
of
tormented
the
imagination
since
war
had
broken
out
with
the
same
enemy
it
seemed
but
logical
to
everybody
to
expect
a
repetition
of
the
same
happenings
the
storehouses
were
besieged
by
women
who
were
securing
stale
food
at
exorbitant
prices
in
order
to
store
it
in
their
homes
future
hunger
was
producing
more
terror
than
immediate
dangers
for
young
desnoyers
these
were
about
all
the
transformations
that
war
was
creating
around
him
people
would
finally
become
accustomed
to
the
new
existence
humanity
has
a
certain
reserve
force
of
adaptation
which
enables
it
to
mould
itself
to
circumstances
and
continue
existing
he
was
hoping
to
continue
his
life
as
though
nothing
had
happened
it
was
enough
for
him
that
marguerite
should
continue
faithful
to
their
past
together
they
would
see
events
slipping
by
them
with
the
cruel
luxuriousness
of
those
who
from
an
inaccessible
height
contemplate
a
flood
without
the
slightest
risk
to
themselves
this
selfish
attitude
had
also
become
habitual
to
argensola
let
us
be
neutral
the
bohemian
would
say
neutrality
does
not
necessarily
mean
indifference
let
us
enjoy
the
great
spectacle
since
nothing
like
it
will
ever
happen
again
in
our
it
was
unfortunate
that
war
should
happen
to
come
when
they
had
so
little
money
argensola
was
hating
the
banks
even
more
than
the
central
powers
distinguishing
with
special
antipathy
the
trust
company
which
was
delaying
payment
of
julio
s
check
how
lovely
it
would
have
been
with
this
sum
available
to
have
forestalled
events
by
laying
in
every
class
of
commodity
in
order
to
supplement
the
domestic
scrimping

and
the

was
now
living
in

unconcern
the
mother
like
other
house
mistresses
had
stored
up
provisions
for
months
and
months
to
come
buying
whatever
eatables
she
was
able
to
lay
hands
on
argensola
took
advantage
of
this
abundance
repeating
his
visits
to
the
home
in
the
avenue
victor
hugo
descending
its
service
stairway
with
great
packages
which
were
swelling
the
supplies
in
the
studio
he
felt
all
the
joys
of
a
good
housekeeper
in
surveying
the
treasures
piled
up
in
the
kitchen
great
tins
of
canned
meat
pyramids
of
butter
crocks
and
bags
of
dried
vegetables
he
had
accumulated
enough
there
to
maintain
a
large
family
the
war
had
now
offered
a
new
pretext
for
him
to
visit
don
marcelo
s
let
them
come
he
would
say
with
a
heroic
gesture
as
he
took
stock
of
his
treasure
trove
let
them
come
when
they
will
we
are
ready
for
them
the
care
and
increase
of
his
provisions
and
the
investigation
of
news
were
the
two
functions
of
his
existence
it
seemed
necessary
to
procure
ten
twelve
fifteen
papers
a
day
some
because
they
were
reactionary
and
the
novelty
of
seeing
all
the
french
united
filled
him
with
enthusiasm
others
because
they
were
radical
and
must
be
better
informed
of
the
news
received
from
the
government
they
generally
appeared
at
midday
at
three
at
four
and
at
five
in
the
afternoon
an
half
hour
s
delay
in
the
publication
of
the
sheet
raised
great
hopes
in
the
public
on
the
qui
vive
for
stupendous
news
all
the
last
supplements
were
snatched
up
everybody
had
his
pockets
stuffed
with
papers
waiting
anxiously
the
issue
of
extras
in
order
to
buy
them
too
yet
all
the
sheets
were
saying
approximately
the
same
thing
argensola
was
developing
a
credulous
enthusiastic
soul
capable
of
admitting
many
improbable
things
he
presumed
that
this
same
spirit
was
probably
animating
everybody
around
him
at
times
his
old
critical
attitude
would
threaten
to
rebel
but
doubt
was
repulsed
as
something
dishonorable
he
was
living
in
a
new
world
and
it
was
but
natural
that
extraordinary
things
should
occur
that
could
be
neither
measured
nor
explained
by
the
old
processes
of
reasoning
so
he
commented
with
infantile
joy
on
the
marvellous
accounts
in
the
daily
papers
of
combats
between
a
single
belgian
platoon
and
entire
regiments
of
enemies
putting
them
to
disorderly
flight
of
the
german
fear
of
the
bayonet
that
made
them
run
like
hares
the
instant
that
the
charge
sounded
of
the
inefficiency
of
the
german
artillery
whose
projectiles
always
missed
fire
it
was
logical
and
natural
that
little
belgium
should
conquer
gigantic
germany
a
repetition
of
david
and
goliath
with
all
the
metaphors
and
images
that
this
unequal
contest
had
inspired
across
so
many
centuries
like
the
greater
part
of
the
nation
he
had
the
mentality
of
a
reader
of
tales
of
chivalry
who
feels
himself
defrauded
if
the
hero
fails
to
cleave
a
thousand
enemies
with
one
fell
stroke
he
purposely
chose
the
most
sensational
papers
those
which
published
many
stories
of
single
encounters
of
individual
deeds
about
which
nobody
could
know
with
any
degree
of
certainty
the
intervention
of
england
on
the
seas
made
him
imagine
a
frightful
famine
coming
providentially
like
a
to
torture
the
enemy
he
honestly
believed
that
ten
days
of
this
maritime
blockade
would
convert
germany
into
a
group
of
shipwrecked
sailors
floating
on
a
raft
this
vision
made
him
repeat
his
visits
to
the
kitchen
to
gloat
over
his
packages
of
provisions
ah
what
they
would
give
in
berlin
for
my
treasures
never
had
argensola
eaten
with
greater
avidity
consideration
of
the
great
privations
suffered
by
the
adversary
was
sharpening
his
appetite
to
a
monstrous
capacity
white
bread
golden
brown
and
crusty
was
stimulating
him
to
an
almost
religious
ecstasy
if
friend
william
could
only
get
his
claws
on
this
he
would
chuckle
to
his
companion
so
he
chewed
and
swallowed
with
increasing
relish
solids
and
liquids
on
passing
through
his
mouth
seemed
to
be
acquiring
a
new
flavor
rare
and
divine
distant
hunger
for
him
was
a
stimulant
a
sauce
of
endless
delight
while
france
was
inspiring
his
enthusiasm
he
was
conceding
greater
credit
to
russia
ah
those
cossacks
he
was
accustomed
to
speak
of
them
as
intimate
friends
he
loved
to
describe
the
unbridled
gallop
of
the
wild
horsemen
impalpable
as
phantoms
and
so
terrible
in
their
wrath
that
the
enemy
could
not
look
them
in
the
face
the
concierge
and
the
used
to
listen
to
him
with
all
the
respect
due
to
a
foreign
gentleman
knowing
much
of
the
great
outside
world
with
which
they
were
not
familiar
the
cossacks
will
adjust
the
accounts
of
these
bandits
he
would
conclude
with
absolute
assurance
within
a
month
they
will
have
entered
and
his
public
composed
of
women
wives
and
mothers
of
those
who
had
gone
to
war
would
modestly
agree
with
him
with
that
irresistible
desire
which
we
all
feel
of
placing
our
hopes
on
something
distant
and
mysterious
the
french
would
defend
the
country
reconquering
besides
the
lost
territories
but
the
cossacks
of
whom
so
many
were
speaking
but
so
few
had
seen
were
going
to
give
the
death
blow
the
only
person
who
knew
them
at
first
hand
was
tchernoff
and
to
argensola
s
astonishment
he
listened
to
his
words
without
showing
any
enthusiasm
the
cossacks
were
for
him
simply
one
body
of
the
russian
army
good
enough
soldiers
but
incapable
of
working
the
miracles
that
everybody
was
expecting
from
them
that
tchernoff
exclaimed
argensola
since
he
hates
the
czar
he
thinks
the
entire
country
mad
he
is
a
revolutionary
fanatic
and
i
am
opposed
to
all
julio
was
listening
to
the
news
brought
by
his
companion
the
vibrating
statements
recited
in
declamatory
tones
the
plans
of
the
campaign
traced
out
on
an
enormous
map
fastened
to
the
wall
of
the
studio
and
bristling
with
tiny
flags
that
marked
the
camps
of
the
belligerent
armies
every
issue
of
the
papers
obliged
the
spaniard
to
arrange
a
new
dance
of
the
pins
on
the
map
followed
by
his
comments
of
optimism
we
have
entered
into
alsace
very
good
it
appears
now
that
we
abandon
alsace
splendid
i
suspect
the
cause
it
is
in
order
to
enter
again
in
a
better
place
getting
at
the
enemy
from
behind
they
say
that
liege
has
fallen
what
a
lie
and
if
it
does
fall
it
doesn
t
matter
just
an
incident
nothing
more
the
others
remain
the
others
that
are
advancing
on
the
eastern
side
and
are
going
to
enter
the
news
from
the
russian
front
was
his
favorite
but
obliged
him
to
remain
in
suspense
every
time
that
he
tried
to
find
on
the
map
the
obscure
names
of
the
places
where
the
admired
cossacks
were
exhibiting
their
wonderful
exploits
meanwhile
julio
was
continuing
the
course
of
his
own
reflections
marguerite
she
had
come
back
at
last
and
yet
each
time
seemed
to
be
drifting
further
away
from
him
in
the
first
days
of
the
mobilization
he
had
haunted
her
neighborhood
trying
to
appease
his
longing
by
this
illusory
proximity
marguerite
had
written
to
him
urging
patience
how
fortunate
it
was
that
he
was
a
foreigner
and
would
not
have
to
endure
the
hardship
of
war
her
brother
an
officer
in
the
artillery
reserves
was
going
at
almost
any
minute
her
mother
who
made
her
home
with
this
bachelor
son
had
kept
an
astonishing
serenity
up
to
the
last
minute
although
she
had
wept
much
while
the
war
was
still
but
a
possibility
she
herself
had
prepared
the
soldier
s
outfit
so
that
the
small
valise
might
contain
all
that
was
indispensable
for
campaign
life
but
marguerite
had
divined
her
poor
mother
s
secret
struggles
not
to
reveal
her
despair
in
moist
eyes
and
trembling
hands
it
was
impossible
to
leave
her
alone
at
such
a
time
then
had
come
the
farewell
god
be
with
you
my
son
do
your
duty
but
be
not
a
tear
nor
a
sign
of
weakness
all
her
family
had
advised
her
not
to
accompany
her
son
to
the
railway
station
so
his
sister
had
gone
with
him
and
upon
returning
home
marguerite
had
found
her
mother
rigid
in
her
arm
chair
with
a
set
face
avoiding
all
mention
of
her
son
speaking
of
the
friends
who
also
had
sent
their
boys
to
the
war
as
if
they
only
could
comprehend
her
torture
poor
mama
i
ought
to
be
with
her
now
more
than
ever
if
i
can
i
shall
come
to
see
when
at
last
she
returned
to
the
rue
de
la
pompe
her
first
care
was
to
explain
to
julio
the
conservatism
of
her
tailored
suit
the
absence
of
jewels
in
the
adornment
of
her
person
the
war
my
dear
now
it
is
the
chic
thing
to
adapt
oneself
to
the
depressing
conditions
to
be
frugal
and
inconspicuous
like
soldiers
who
knows
what
we
may
expect
her
infatuation
with
dress
still
accompanied
her
in
every
moment
of
her
life
julio
noticed
a
persistent
about
her
it
seemed
as
though
her
spirit
abandoning
her
body
was
wandering
to
places
her
eyes
were
looking
at
him
but
she
seldom
saw
him
she
would
speak
very
slowly
as
though
wishing
to
weigh
every
word
fearful
of
betraying
some
secret
this
spiritual
alienation
did
not
however
prevent
her
slipping
bodily
along
the
smooth
path
of
custom
although
afterwards
she
would
seem
to
feel
a
vague
remorse
i
wonder
if
it
is
right
to
do
this
is
it
not
wrong
to
live
like
this
when
so
many
sorrows
are
falling
on
the
world
julio
hushed
her
scruples
with
but
if
we
are
going
to
marry
as
soon
as
possible
if
we
are
already
the
same
as
husband
and
wife
she
replied
with
a
gesture
of
strangeness
and
dismay
to
marry
ten
days
ago
she
had
had
no
other
wish
now
the
possibility
of
marriage
was
recurring
less
and
less
in
her
thoughts
why
think
about
such
remote
and
uncertain
events
more
immediate
things
were
occupying
her
mind
the
farewell
to
her
brother
in
the
station
was
a
scene
which
had
fixed
itself
ineradicably
in
her
memory
upon
going
to
the
studio
she
had
planned
not
to
speak
about
it
foreseeing
that
she
might
annoy
her
lover
with
this
account
but
alas
she
had
only
to
vow
not
to
mention
a
thing
to
feel
an
irresistible
impulse
to
talk
about
it
she
had
never
suspected
that
she
could
love
her
brother
so
dearly
her
former
affection
for
him
had
been
mingled
with
a
silent
sentiment
of
jealousy
because
her
mother
had
preferred
the
older
child
besides
he
was
the
one
who
had
introduced
laurier
to
his
home
the
two
held
diplomas
as
industrial
engineers
and
had
been
close
friends
from
their
school
days
but
upon
seeing
the
boy
ready
to
depart
marguerite
suddenly
discovered
that
this
brother
who
had
always
been
of
secondary
interest
to
her
was
now
occupying
a
place
in
her
affections
he
was
so
handsome
so
interesting
in
his
lieutenant
s
uniform
he
looked
like
another
person
i
will
admit
to
you
that
i
was
very
proud
to
walk
beside
him
leaning
on
his
arm
people
thought
that
we
were
married
seeing
me
weep
some
poor
women
tried
to
console
me
saying
courage
madame
your
man
will
come
he
just
laughed
at
hearing
these
mistakes
the
only
thing
that
was
really
saddening
him
was
thinking
about
our
they
had
separated
at
the
door
of
the
station
the
sentries
would
not
let
her
go
any
further
so
she
had
handed
over
his
sword
that
she
had
wished
to
carry
till
the
last
moment
it
is
lovely
to
be
a
man
she
exclaimed
enthusiastically
i
would
love
to
wear
a
uniform
to
go
to
war
to
be
of
some
real
use
she
tried
not
to
say
more
about
it
as
though
she
suddenly
realized
the
inopportuneness
of
her
last
words
perhaps
she
noticed
the
scowl
on
julio
s
face
she
was
however
so
wrought
up
by
the
memory
of
that
farewell
that
after
a
long
pause
she
was
unable
to
resist
the
temptation
of
again
putting
her
thought
into
words
at
the
station
entrance
while
she
was
kissing
her
brother
for
the
last
time
she
had
an
encounter
a
great
surprise
he
had
approached
also
clad
as
an
artillery
officer
but
alone
having
to
entrust
his
valise
to
a
man
from
the
crowd
julio
shot
her
a
questioning
look
who
was
he
he
suspected
but
feigned
ignorance
as
though
fearing
to
learn
the
truth
laurier
she
replied
laconically
my
former
the
lover
displayed
a
cruel
irony
it
was
a
cowardly
thing
to
ridicule
this
man
who
had
responded
to
the
call
of
duty
he
recognized
his
vileness
but
a
malign
and
irresistible
instinct
made
him
keep
on
with
his
sneers
in
order
to
discredit
the
man
before
marguerite
laurier
a
soldier
he
must
cut
a
pretty
figure
dressed
in
uniform
laurier
the
warrior
he
continued
in
a
voice
so
sarcastic
and
strange
that
it
seemed
to
be
coming
from
somebody
else
poor
creature
she
hesitated
in
her
response
not
wishing
to
exasperate
desnoyers
any
further
but
the
truth
was
uppermost
in
her
mind
and
she
said
simply
no
no
he
didn
t
look
so
bad
quite
the
contrary
perhaps
it
was
the
uniform
perhaps
it
was
his
sadness
at
going
away
alone
completely
alone
without
a
single
hand
to
clasp
his
i
didn
t
recognize
him
at
first
seeing
my
brother
he
started
toward
us
but
then
when
he
saw
me
he
went
his
own
way
poor
man
i
feel
sorry
for
him
her
feminine
instinct
must
have
told
her
that
she
was
talking
too
much
and
she
cut
her
chatter
suddenly
short
the
same
instinct
warned
her
that
julio
s
countenance
was
growing
more
and
more
saturnine
and
his
mouth
taking
a
very
bitter
curve
she
wanted
to
console
him
and
added
what
luck
that
you
are
a
foreigner
and
will
not
have
to
go
to
the
war
how
horrible
it
would
be
for
me
to
lose
you
she
said
it
sincerely
a
few
moments
before
she
had
been
envying
men
admiring
the
gallantry
with
which
they
were
exposing
their
lives
and
now
she
was
trembling
before
the
idea
that
her
lover
might
have
been
one
of
these
this
did
not
please
his
amorous
egoism
to
be
placed
apart
from
the
rest
as
a
delicate
and
fragile
being
only
fit
for
feminine
adoration
he
preferred
to
inspire
the
envy
that
she
had
felt
on
beholding
her
brother
decked
out
in
his
warlike
accoutrement
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
was
coming
between
him
and
marguerite
that
would
never
disappear
that
would
go
on
expanding
repelling
them
in
contrary
directions
far
very
far
even
to
the
point
of
not
recognizing
each
other
when
their
glances
met
he
continued
to
be
conscious
of
this
impalpable
obstacle
in
their
following
interviews
marguerite
was
extremely
affectionate
in
her
speech
and
would
look
at
him
with
moist
and
loving
eyes
but
her
caressing
hands
appeared
more
like
those
of
a
mother
than
a
lover
and
her
tenderness
was
accompanied
with
a
certain
disinterestedness
and
extraordinary
modesty
she
seemed
to
prefer
remaining
obstinately
in
the
studio
declining
to
go
into
the
other
rooms
we
are
so
comfortable
here
i
would
rather
not
it
is
not
worth
while
i
should
feel
remorse
afterwards
why
think
of
such
things
in
these
anxious
times
the
world
around
her
seemed
saturated
with
love
but
it
was
a
new
love
a
love
for
the
man
who
is
suffering
desire
for
abnegation
for
sacrifice
this
love
called
forth
visions
of
white
caps
of
tremulous
hands
healing
and
bleeding
flesh
every
advance
on
julio
s
part
but
aroused
in
marguerite
a
vehement
and
modest
protest
as
though
they
were
meeting
for
the
first
time
it
is
impossible
she
protested
i
keep
thinking
of
my
brother
and
of
so
many
that
i
know
that
may
be
dying
at
this
very
news
of
battles
were
beginning
to
arrive
and
blood
was
beginning
to
flow
in
great
quantities
no
no
i
can
not
she
kept
repeating
and
when
julio
finally
triumphed
he
found
that
her
thoughts
were
still
following
independently
the
same
line
of
mental
stress
one
afternoon
marguerite
announced
that
henceforth
she
would
see
him
less
frequently
she
was
attending
classes
now
and
had
only
two
free
days
desnoyers
listened
dumbfounded
classes
what
were
her
studies
she
seemed
a
little
irritated
at
his
mocking
expression
yes
she
was
studying
for
the
past
week
she
had
been
attending
classes
now
the
lessons
were
going
to
be
more
regular
the
course
of
instruction
had
been
fully
organized
and
there
were
many
more
instructors
i
wish
to
be
a
trained
nurse
i
am
distressed
over
my
uselessness
of
what
good
have
i
ever
been
till
now
she
was
silent
for
a
few
moments
as
though
reviewing
her
past
at
times
i
almost
think
she
mused
that
war
with
all
its
horrors
still
has
some
good
in
it
it
helps
to
make
us
useful
to
our
fellowmen
we
look
at
life
more
seriously
trouble
makes
us
realize
that
we
have
come
into
the
world
for
some
purpose
i
believe
that
we
must
not
love
life
only
for
the
pleasures
that
it
brings
us
we
ought
to
find
satisfaction
in
sacrifice
in
dedicating
ourselves
to
others
and
this
satisfaction
i
don
t
know
just
why
perhaps
because
it
is
new
appears
to
me
superior
to
all
other
julio
looked
at
her
in
surprise
trying
to
imagine
what
was
going
on
in
that
idolized
and
frivolous
head
what
ideas
were
forming
back
of
that
thoughtful
forehead
which
until
then
had
merely
reflected
the
slightest
shadow
of
thoughts
as
swift
and
flitting
as
birds
but
the
former
marguerite
was
still
alive
he
saw
her
constantly
reappearing
in
a
funny
way
among
the
sombre
preoccupations
with
which
war
was
overshadowing
all
lives
we
have
to
study
very
hard
in
order
to
earn
our
diplomas
as
nurses
have
you
noticed
our
uniform
it
is
most
distinctive
and
the
white
is
so
becoming
both
to
blondes
and
brunettes
then
the
cap
which
allows
little
curls
over
the
ears
the
fashionable
coiffure
and
the
blue
cape
over
the
white
suit
make
a
splendid
contrast
with
this
outfit
a
woman
well
shod
and
with
few
jewels
may
present
a
truly
chic
appearance
it
is
a
mixture
of
nun
and
great
lady
which
is
vastly
she
was
going
to
study
with
a
regular
fury
in
order
to
become
really
useful
and
sooner
to
wear
the
admired
uniform
poor
desnoyers
the
longing
to
see
her
and
the
lack
of
occupation
in
these
interminable
afternoons
which
hitherto
had
been
employed
so
delightfully
compelled
him
to
haunt
the
neighborhood
of
the
unoccupied
palace
where
the
government
had
just
established
the
training
school
for
nurses
stationing
himself
at
the
corner
watching
the
fluttering
skirts
and
quick
steps
of
the
feminine
feet
on
the
sidewalk
he
imagined
that
the
course
of
time
must
have
turned
backward
and
that
he
was
still
but
eighteen
the
same
as
when
he
used
to
hang
around
the
establishments
of
some
celebrated
modiste
the
groups
of
women
that
at
certain
hours
came
out
of
the
palace
suggested
these
former
days
they
were
dressed
extremely
quietly
the
aspect
of
many
of
them
as
humble
as
that
of
the
seamstresses
but
they
were
ladies
of
the
class
some
even
coming
in
automobiles
driven
by
chauffeurs
in
military
uniform
because
they
were
ministerial
vehicles
these
long
waits
often
brought
him
unexpected
encounters
with
the
elegant
students
who
were
going
and
coming
desnoyers
some
feminine
voices
would
exclaim
behind
him
isn
t
it
desnoyers
and
he
would
find
himself
obliged
to
relieve
their
doubts
saluting
the
ladies
who
were
looking
at
him
as
though
he
were
a
ghost
they
were
friends
of
a
remote
epoch
of
six
months
ago
ladies
who
had
admired
and
pursued
him
trusting
sweetly
to
his
masterly
wisdom
to
guide
them
through
the
seven
circles
of
the
science
of
the
tango
they
were
now
scrutinizing
him
as
if
between
their
last
encounter
and
the
present
moment
had
occurred
a
great
cataclysm
transforming
all
the
laws
of
existence
as
if
he
were
the
sole
survivor
of
a
vanished
race
eventually
they
all
asked
the
same
questions
are
you
not
going
to
the
war
how
is
it
that
you
are
not
wearing
a
uniform
he
would
attempt
to
explain
but
at
his
first
words
they
would
interrupt
him
that
s
so
you
are
a
they
would
say
it
with
a
certain
envy
doubtless
thinking
of
their
loved
ones
now
suffering
the
privations
and
dangers
of
war
but
the
fact
that
he
was
a
foreigner
would
instantly
create
a
vague
atmosphere
of
spiritual
aloofness
an
alienation
that
julio
had
not
known
in
the
good
old
days
when
people
sought
each
other
without
considering
nationality
without
feeling
that
disavowal
of
danger
which
isolates
and
concentrates
human
groups
the
ladies
generally
bade
him
adieu
with
malicious
suspicion
what
was
he
doing
hanging
around
there
in
search
of
his
usual
lucky
adventure
and
their
smiles
were
rather
grave
the
smiles
of
older
folk
who
know
the
true
significance
of
life
and
commiserate
the
deluded
ones
still
seeking
diversion
in
frivolities
this
attitude
was
as
annoying
to
julio
as
though
it
were
a
manifestation
of
pity
they
were
supposing
him
still
exercising
the
only
function
of
which
he
was
capable
he
wasn
t
good
for
anything
else
on
the
other
hand
these
empty
heads
still
keeping
something
of
their
old
appearance
now
appeared
animated
by
the
grand
sentiment
of
maternity
an
abstract
maternity
which
seemed
to
be
extending
to
all
the
men
of
the
nation
a
desire
for
of
knowing
the
privations
of
the
lowly
and
aiding
all
the
ills
that
flesh
is
heir
to
this
same
yearning
was
inspiring
marguerite
when
she
came
away
from
her
lessons
she
was
advancing
from
one
overpowering
dread
to
another
accepting
the
first
rudiments
of
surgery
as
the
greatest
of
scientific
marvels
at
the
same
time
she
was
astonished
at
the
avidity
with
which
she
was
assimilating
these
hitherto
unsuspected
mysteries
sometimes
with
a
funny
assumption
of
assurance
she
would
even
believe
she
had
mistaken
her
vocation
who
knows
but
what
i
was
born
to
be
a
famous
doctor
she
would
exclaim
her
great
fear
was
that
she
might
lose
her
when
the
time
came
to
put
her
newly
acquired
knowledge
into
practice
to
see
herself
before
the
foul
odors
of
decomposing
flesh
to
contemplate
the
flow
of
blood
a
horrible
thing
for
her
who
had
always
felt
an
invincible
repugnance
toward
all
the
unpleasant
conditions
of
ordinary
life
but
these
hesitations
were
short
and
she
was
suddenly
animated
by
a
dashing
energy
these
were
times
of
sacrifice
were
not
the
men
snatched
every
day
from
the
comforts
of
sensuous
existence
to
endure
the
rude
life
of
a
soldier
she
would
be
a
soldier
in
petticoats
facing
pain
battling
with
it
plunging
her
hands
into
putrefaction
flashing
like
a
ray
of
sunlight
into
the
places
where
soldiers
were
expecting
the
approach
of
death
she
proudly
narrated
to
desnoyers
all
the
progress
that
she
was
making
in
the
training
school
the
complicated
bandages
that
she
was
learning
to
adjust
sometimes
over
a
mannikin
at
others
over
the
flesh
of
an
employee
trying
to
play
the
part
of
a
sorely
wounded
patient
she
so
dainty
so
incapable
in
her
own
home
of
the
slightest
physical
effort
was
learning
the
most
skilful
ways
of
lifting
a
human
body
from
the
ground
and
carrying
it
on
her
back
who
knew
but
that
she
might
render
this
very
service
some
day
on
the
battlefield
she
was
ready
for
the
greatest
risks
with
the
ignorant
audacity
of
women
impelled
by
flashes
of
heroism
all
her
admiration
was
for
the
english
army
nurses
slender
women
of
nervous
vigor
whose
photographs
were
appearing
in
the
papers
wearing
pantaloons
riding
boots
and
white
helmets
julio
listened
to
her
with
astonishment
was
this
woman
really
marguerite
war
was
obliterating
all
her
winning
vanities
she
was
no
longer
fluttering
about
in
fashion
her
feet
were
treading
the
earth
with
resolute
firmness
calm
and
secure
in
the
new
strength
which
was
developing
within
when
one
of
his
caresses
would
remind
her
that
she
was
a
woman
she
would
always
say
the
same
thing
what
luck
that
you
are
a
foreigner
what
happiness
to
know
that
you
do
not
have
to
go
to
war
in
her
anxiety
for
sacrifice
she
wanted
to
go
to
the
battlefields
and
yet
at
the
same
time
she
was
rejoicing
to
see
her
lover
exempt
from
military
duty
this
preposterous
lack
of
logic
was
not
gratefully
received
by
julio
but
irritated
him
as
an
unconscious
offense
one
might
suppose
that
she
was
protecting
me
he
thought
she
is
the
man
and
rejoices
that
i
the
weak
comrade
should
be
protected
from
danger
what
a
grotesque
situation
fortunately
at
times
when
marguerite
presented
herself
at
the
studio
she
was
again
her
old
self
making
him
temporarily
forget
his
annoyance
she
would
arrive
with
the
same
joy
in
a
vacation
that
the
college
student
or
the
employee
feels
on
a
holiday
responsibility
was
teaching
her
to
know
the
value
of
time
no
classes
she
would
call
out
on
entering
and
tossing
her
hat
on
a
divan
she
would
begin
a
retreating
with
infantile
coquetry
from
the
arms
of
her
lover
but
in
a
few
minutes
she
would
recover
her
customary
gravity
the
serious
look
that
had
become
habitual
with
her
since
the
outbreak
of
hostilities
she
spoke
often
of
her
mother
always
sad
but
striving
to
hide
her
grief
and
keeping
herself
up
in
the
hope
of
a
letter
from
her
son
she
spoke
too
of
the
war
commenting
on
the
latest
events
with
the
rhetorical
optimism
of
the
official
dispatches
she
could
describe
the
first
flag
taken
from
the
enemy
as
minutely
as
though
it
were
a
garment
of
unparalleled
elegance
from
a
window
she
had
seen
the
minister
of
war
she
was
very
much
affected
when
repeating
the
story
of
some
fugitive
belgians
recently
arrived
at
the
hospital
they
were
the
only
patients
that
she
had
been
able
to
assist
until
now
paris
was
not
receiving
the
soldiers
wounded
in
battle
by
order
of
the
government
they
were
being
sent
from
the
front
to
the
hospitals
in
the
south
she
no
longer
evinced
toward
julio
the
resistance
of
the
first
few
days
her
training
as
a
nurse
was
giving
her
a
certain
passivity
she
seemed
to
be
ignoring
material
attractions
stripping
them
of
the
spiritual
importance
which
she
had
hitherto
attributed
to
them
she
wanted
to
make
julio
happy
although
her
mind
was
concentrated
on
other
matters
one
afternoon
she
felt
the
necessity
of
communicating
certain
news
which
had
been
filling
her
mind
since
the
day
before
springing
up
from
the
couch
she
hunted
for
her
handbag
which
contained
a
letter
she
wanted
to
read
it
again
to
tell
its
contents
to
somebody
with
that
irresistible
impulse
which
forestalls
confession
it
was
a
letter
which
her
brother
had
sent
her
from
the
vosges
in
it
he
spoke
of
laurier
more
than
of
himself
they
belonged
to
different
batteries
but
were
in
the
same
division
and
had
taken
part
in
the
same
combats
the
officer
was
filled
with
admiration
for
his
former
who
could
have
guessed
that
a
future
hero
was
hidden
within
that
silent
and
tranquil
engineer
but
he
was
a
genuine
hero
just
the
same
all
the
officials
had
agreed
with
marguerite
s
brother
on
seeing
how
calmly
he
fulfilled
his
duty
facing
death
with
the
same
coolness
as
though
he
were
in
his
factory
near
paris
he
had
asked
for
the
dangerous
post
of
lookout
slipping
as
near
as
possible
to
the
enemy
s
lines
in
order
to
verify
the
exactitude
of
the
artillery
discharge
rectifying
it
by
telephone
a
german
shell
had
demolished
the
house
on
the
roof
of
which
he
was
concealed
and
laurier
on
crawling
out
unhurt
from
the
ruins
had
readjusted
his
telephone
and
gone
tranquilly
on
continuing
the
same
work
in
the
shelter
of
a
nearby
grove
his
battery
picked
out
by
the
enemy
s
aeroplanes
had
received
the
concentrated
fire
of
the
artillery
opposite
in
a
few
minutes
all
the
force
were
rolling
on
the
ground
the
captain
and
many
soldiers
dead
officers
wounded
and
almost
all
the
gunners
there
only
remained
as
chief
laurier
the
impassive
as
his
comrades
nicknamed
him
and
aided
by
the
few
artillerymen
still
on
their
feet
he
continued
firing
under
a
rain
of
iron
and
fire
so
as
to
cover
the
retreat
of
a
battalion
he
has
been
mentioned
twice
in
dispatches
marguerite
continued
reading
i
do
not
believe
that
it
will
be
long
before
they
give
him
the
cross
he
is
valiant
in
every
way
who
would
have
supposed
all
this
a
few
weeks
ago
she
did
not
share
the
general
astonishment
living
with
laurier
had
many
times
shown
her
the
intrepidity
of
his
character
the
fearlessness
concealed
under
that
placid
exterior
on
that
account
her
instincts
had
warned
her
against
rousing
her
husband
s
wrath
in
the
first
days
of
her
infidelity
she
still
remembered
the
way
he
looked
the
night
he
surprised
her
leaving
julio
s
home
his
was
the
passion
that
kills
and
nevertheless
he
had
not
attempted
the
least
violence
with
her
the
memory
of
his
consideration
was
awakening
in
marguerite
a
sentiment
of
gratitude
perhaps
he
had
loved
her
as
no
other
man
had
her
eyes
with
an
irresistible
desire
for
comparison
sought
julio
s
admiring
his
youthful
grace
and
distinction
the
image
of
laurier
heavy
and
ordinary
came
into
her
mind
as
a
consolation
certainly
the
officer
whom
she
had
seen
at
the
station
when
saying
to
her
brother
did
not
seem
to
her
like
her
old
husband
but
marguerite
wished
to
forget
the
pallid
lieutenant
with
the
sad
countenance
who
had
passed
before
her
eyes
preferring
to
remember
him
only
as
the
manufacturer
preoccupied
with
profits
and
incapable
of
comprehending
what
she
was
accustomed
to
call
the
delicate
refinements
of
a
chic
decidedly
julio
was
the
more
fascinating
she
did
not
repent
of
her
past
she
did
not
wish
to
repent
of
it
and
her
loving
selfishness
made
her
repeat
once
more
the
same
old
exclamation
how
fortunate
that
you
are
a
foreigner
what
a
relief
to
know
that
you
are
safe
from
the
dangers
of
war
julio
felt
the
usual
exasperation
at
hearing
this
he
came
very
near
to
closing
his
beloved
s
mouth
with
his
hand
was
she
trying
to
make
fun
of
him
it
was
fairly
insulting
to
place
him
apart
from
other
men
meanwhile
with
blind
irrelevance
she
persisted
in
talking
about
laurier
commenting
upon
his
achievements
i
do
not
love
him
i
never
have
loved
him
do
not
look
so
cross
how
could
the
poor
man
ever
be
compared
with
you
you
must
admit
though
that
his
new
existence
is
rather
interesting
i
rejoice
in
his
brave
deeds
as
though
an
old
friend
had
done
them
a
family
visitor
whom
i
had
not
seen
for
a
long
time
the
poor
man
deserved
a
better
fate
he
ought
to
have
married
some
other
woman
some
companion
more
on
a
level
with
his
ideals
i
tell
you
that
i
really
pity
him
and
this
pity
was
so
intense
that
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
awakening
the
tortures
of
jealousy
in
her
lover
after
these
interviews
desnoyers
was
more
and
despondent
than
ever
i
am
beginning
to
realize
that
we
are
in
a
false
position
he
said
one
morning
to
argensola
life
is
going
to
become
increasingly
painful
it
is
difficult
to
remain
tranquil
continuing
the
same
old
existence
in
the
midst
of
a
people
at
his
companion
had
about
come
to
the
same
conclusion
he
too
was
beginning
to
feel
that
the
life
of
a
young
foreigner
in
paris
was
insufferable
now
that
it
was
so
upset
by
war
one
has
to
keep
showing
passports
all
the
time
in
order
that
the
police
may
be
sure
that
they
have
not
discovered
a
deserter
in
the
street
car
the
other
afternoon
i
had
to
explain
that
i
was
a
spaniard
to
some
girls
who
were
wondering
why
i
was
not
at
the
front
one
of
them
as
soon
as
she
learned
my
nationality
asked
me
with
great
simplicity
why
i
did
not
offer
myself
as
a
volunteer
now
they
have
invented
a
word
for
the
calling
them
les
embusques
the
hidden
ones
i
am
sick
and
tired
of
the
ironical
looks
shot
at
me
wherever
i
go
it
makes
me
wild
to
be
taken
for
an
a
flash
of
heroism
was
galvanizing
the
impressionable
bohemian
now
that
everybody
was
going
to
the
war
he
was
wishing
to
do
the
same
thing
he
was
not
afraid
of
death
the
only
thing
that
was
disturbing
him
was
the
military
service
the
uniform
the
mechanical
obedience
to
the
blind
subservience
to
the
chiefs
fighting
was
not
offering
any
difficulties
for
him
but
his
nature
capriciously
resented
everything
in
the
form
of
discipline
the
foreign
groups
in
paris
were
trying
to
organize
each
its
own
legion
of
volunteers
and
he
too
was
planning
his
a
battalion
of
spaniards
and
south
americans
reserving
naturally
the
presidency
of
the
organizing
committee
for
himself
and
later
the
command
of
the
body
he
had
inserted
notices
in
the
papers
making
the
studio
in
the
rue
de
la
pompe
the
recruiting
office
in
ten
days
two
volunteers
had
presented
themselves
a
clerk
shivering
in
midsummer
who
stipulated
that
he
should
be
an
officer
because
he
was
wearing
a
suitable
jacket
and
a
spanish
who
at
the
very
outset
had
wished
to
rob
argensola
of
his
command
on
the
futile
pretext
that
he
was
a
soldier
in
his
youth
while
the
bohemian
was
only
an
artist
twenty
spanish
battalions
were
attempted
with
the
same
result
in
different
parts
of
paris
each
enthusiast
wished
to
be
commander
of
the
others
with
the
individual
haughtiness
and
aversion
to
discipline
so
characteristic
of
the
race
finally
the
future
generalissimos
decided
to
enlist
as
simple
volunteers
but
in
a
french
regiment
i
am
waiting
to
see
what
the
garibaldis
do
said
argensola
modestly
perhaps
i
may
go
with
this
glorious
name
made
military
service
conceivable
to
him
but
then
he
vacillated
he
would
certainly
have
to
obey
somebody
in
this
body
of
volunteers
and
he
did
not
believe
in
an
obedience
that
was
not
preceded
by
long
discussions
what
next
life
has
changed
in
a
fortnight
he
continued
it
seems
as
if
we
were
living
in
another
planet
our
former
achievements
are
not
appreciated
others
most
obscure
and
poor
those
who
formerly
had
the
least
consideration
are
now
promoted
to
the
first
ranks
the
refined
man
of
complex
spirituality
has
disappeared
for
who
knows
how
many
years
now
the
man
climbs
triumphantly
to
the
top
because
though
his
ideas
are
limited
they
are
sure
and
he
knows
how
to
obey
we
are
no
longer
the
desnoyers
assented
it
was
so
they
were
no
longer
fashionable
none
knew
that
better
than
he
for
he
who
was
once
the
sensation
of
the
day
was
now
passing
as
a
stranger
among
the
very
people
who
a
few
months
before
had
raved
over
him
your
reign
is
over
laughed
argensola
the
fact
that
you
are
a
handsome
fellow
doesn
t
help
you
one
bit
nowadays
in
a
uniform
and
with
a
cross
on
my
breast
i
could
soon
get
the
best
of
you
in
a
rival
love
affair
in
times
of
peace
the
officers
only
set
the
girls
of
the
provinces
to
dreaming
but
now
that
we
are
at
war
there
has
awakened
in
every
woman
the
ancestral
enthusiasm
that
her
remote
grandmothers
used
to
feel
for
the
strong
and
aggressive
beast
the
dames
who
a
few
months
ago
were
complicating
their
desires
with
psychological
subtleties
are
now
admiring
the
military
man
with
the
same
simplicity
that
the
maid
has
for
the
common
soldier
before
a
uniform
they
feel
the
humble
and
servile
enthusiasm
of
the
female
of
the
lower
animals
before
the
crests
foretops
and
gay
plumes
of
the
fighting
males
look
out
master
we
shall
have
to
follow
the
new
course
of
events
or
resign
ourselves
to
everlasting
obscurity
the
tango
is
and
desnoyers
agreed
that
truly
they
were
two
beings
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
life
which
at
one
bound
had
changed
its
course
there
was
no
longer
any
place
in
the
new
existence
for
that
poor
painter
of
souls
nor
for
that
hero
of
a
frivolous
life
who
from
five
to
seven
every
afternoon
had

chapter
iii
the
retreat
war
had
extended
one
of
its
antennae
even
to
the
avenue
victor
hugo
it
was
a
silent
war
in
which
the
enemy
bland
shapeless
and
gelatinous
seemed
constantly
to
be
escaping
from
the
hands
only
to
renew
hostilities
a
little
later
on
i
have
germany
in
my
own
house
growled
marcelo
desnoyers
germany
was
dona
elena
the
wife
of
von
hartrott
why
had
not
her
son
that
professor
of
inexhaustible
sufficiency
whom
he
now
believed
to
have
been
a
spy
taken
her
home
with
him
for
what
sentimental
caprice
had
she
wished
to
stay
with
her
sister
losing
the
opportunity
of
returning
to
berlin
before
the
frontiers
were
closed
the
presence
of
this
woman
in
his
home
was
the
cause
of
many
compunctions
and
alarms
fortunately
the
chauffeur
and
all
the
were
in
the
army
the
two
chinas
received
an
order
in
a
threatening
tone
they
must
be
very
careful
when
talking
to
the
french
maids
not
the
slightest
allusion
to
the
nationality
of
dona
elena
s
husband
nor
to
the
residence
of
her
family
dona
elena
was
an
argentinian
but
in
spite
of
the
silence
of
the
maids
don
marcelo
was
always
in
fear
of
some
outburst
of
exalted
patriotism
and
that
his
wife
s
sister
might
suddenly
find
herself
confined
in
a
concentration
camp
under
suspicion
of
having
dealings
with
the
enemy
frau
von
hartrott
made
his
uneasiness
worse
instead
of
keeping
a
discreet
silence
she
was
constantly
introducing
discord
into
the
home
with
her
opinions
during
the
first
days
of
the
war
she
kept
herself
locked
in
her
room
joining
the
family
only
when
summoned
to
the
dining
room
with
tightly
puckered
mouth
and
an
air
she
would
then
seat
herself
at
the
table
pretending
not
to
hear
don
marcelo
s
verbal
outpourings
of
enthusiasm
he
enjoyed
describing
the
departure
of
the
troops
the
moving
scenes
in
the
streets
and
at
the
stations
commenting
on
events
with
an
optimism
sure
of
the
first
news
of
the
war
two
things
were
beyond
all
discussion
the
bayonet
was
the
secret
of
the
french
and
the
germans
were
shuddering
with
terror
before
its
fatal
glistening
point
the
cannon
had
proved
itself
a
unique
jewel
its
shots
being
absolutely
sure
he
was
really
feeling
sorry
for
the
enemy
s
artillery
since
its
projectiles
so
seldom
exploded
even
when
well
aimed
furthermore
the
french
troops
had
entered
victoriously
into
alsace
many
little
towns
were
already
theirs
now
it
is
as
it
was
in
the
s
he
would
exult
brandishing
his
fork
and
waving
his
napkin
we
are
going
to
kick
them
back
to
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
kick
them
that
s
the
chichi
always
agreed
gleefully
while
dona
elena
was
raising
her
eyes
to
heaven
as
though
silently
calling
upon
somebody
hidden
in
the
ceiling
to
bear
witness
to
such
errors
and
blasphemies
the
kind
dona
luisa
always
sought
her
out
afterwards
in
the
retirement
of
her
room
believing
it
necessary
to
give
sisterly
counsel
to
one
living
so
far
from
home
the
romantica
did
not
maintain
her
austere
silence
before
the
sister
who
had
always
venerated
her
superior
instruction
so
now
the
poor
lady
was
overwhelmed
with
accounts
of
the
stupendous
forces
of
germany
enunciated
with
all
the
authority
of
a
wife
of
a
great
teutonic
patriot
and
a
mother
of
an
almost
celebrated
professor
according
to
her
graphic
picture
millions
of
men
were
now
surging
forth
in
enormous
streams
thousands
of
cannons
were
filing
by
and
tremendous
mortars
like
monstrous
turrets
and
towering
above
all
this
vast
machinery
of
destruction
was
a
man
who
alone
was
worth
an
army
a
being
who
knew
everything
and
could
do
everything
handsome
intelligent
and
infallible
as
a
god
the
emperor
the
french
just
don
t
know
what
s
ahead
of
them
declared
dona
elena
we
are
going
to
annihilate
them
it
is
merely
a
matter
of
two
weeks
before
august
is
ended
the
emperor
will
have
entered
senora
desnoyers
was
so
greatly
impressed
by
these
dire
prophecies
that
she
could
not
hide
them
from
her
family
chichi
waxed
indignant
at
her
mother
s
credulity
and
her
aunt
s
germanism
martial
fervor
was
flaming
up
in
the
former
peoncito
ay
if
the
women
could
only
go
to
war
she
enjoyed
picturing
herself
on
horseback
in
command
of
a
regiment
of
dragoons
charging
the
enemy
with
other
amazons
as
dashing
and
buxom
as
she
then
her
fondness
for
skating
would
predominate
over
her
tastes
for
the
cavalry
and
she
would
long
to
be
an
alpine
hunter
a
diable
bleu
among
those
who
slid
on
long
runners
with
musket
slung
across
the
back
and
alpenstock
in
hand
over
the
snowy
slopes
of
the
vosges
but
the
government
did
not
appreciate
the
valorous
women
and
she
could
obtain
no
other
part
in
the
war
but
to
admire
the
uniform
of
her
rene
lacour
converted
into
a
soldier
the
senator
s
son
certainly
looked
beautiful
he
was
tall
and
fair
of
a
rather
feminine
type
recalling
his
dead
mother
in
his
fiancee
s
opinion
rene
was
just
a
little
sugar
at
first
she
had
been
very
proud
to
walk
the
streets
by
the
side
of
this
warrior
believing
that
his
uniform
had
greatly
augmented
his
personal
charm
but
little
by
little
a
revulsion
of
feeling
was
clouding
her
joy
the
senatorial
prince
was
nothing
but
a
common
soldier
his
illustrious
father
fearful
that
the
war
might
cut
off
forever
the
dynasty
of
the
lacours
indispensable
to
the
welfare
of
the
state
had
had
his
son
mustered
into
the
auxiliary
service
of
the
army
by
this
arrangement
his
heir
need
not
leave
paris
ranking
about
as
high
as
those
who
were
kneading
the
bread
or
mending
the
soldiers
cloaks
only
by
going
to
the
front
could
he
claim
as
a
student
of
the
ecole
centrale
his
title
of
in
the
artillery
reserves
what
happiness
for
me
that
you
have
to
stay
in
paris
how
delighted
i
am
that
you
are
just
a
private
and
yet
at
the
same
time
chichi
was
thinking
enviously
of
her
friends
whose
lovers
and
brothers
were
officers
they
could
parade
the
streets
escorted
by
a
kepis
that
attracted
the
notice
of
the
and
the
respectful
salute
of
the
lower
ranks
each
time
that
dona
luisa
terrified
by
the
forecasts
of
her
sister
undertook
to
communicate
her
dismay
to
her
daughter
the
girl
would
rage
up
and
down
exclaiming
what
lies
my
aunt
tells
you
since
her
husband
is
a
german
she
sees
everything
as
he
wishes
it
to
be
papa
knows
more
rene
s
father
is
better
informed
about
these
things
we
are
going
to
give
them
a
thorough
hiding
what
fun
it
will
be
when
they
hit
my
uncle
and
all
my
snippy
cousins
in
berlin
hush
groaned
her
mother
do
not
talk
such
nonsense
the
war
has
turned
you
as
crazy
as
your
the
good
lady
was
scandalized
at
hearing
the
outburst
of
savage
desires
that
the
mere
mention
of
the
kaiser
always
aroused
in
her
daughter
in
times
of
peace
chichi
had
rather
admired
this
personage
he
s
not
so
she
had
commented
but
with
a
very
ordinary
now
all
her
wrath
was
concentrated
upon
him
the
thousands
of
women
that
were
weeping
through
his
fault
the
mothers
without
sons
the
wives
without
husbands
the
poor
children
left
in
the
burning
towns
ah
the
vile
wretch
and
she
would
brandish
her
knife
of
the
old
peoncito
days
a
dagger
with
silver
handle
and
sheath
richly
chased
a
gift
that
her
grandfather
had
exhumed
from
some
forgotten
souvenirs
of
his
childhood
in
an
old
valise
the
very
first
german
that
she
came
across
was
doomed
to
death
dona
luisa
was
terrified
to
find
her
flourishing
this
weapon
before
her
dressing
mirror
she
was
no
longer
yearning
to
be
a
cavalryman
nor
a
diable
bleu
she
would
be
entirely
content
if
they
would
leave
her
alone
in
some
closed
space
with
the
detested
monster
in
just
five
minutes
she
would
settle
the
universal
conflict
defend
yourself
boche
she
would
shriek
standing
at
guard
as
in
her
childhood
she
had
seen
the
peons
doing
on
the
ranch
and
with
a
above
and
below
she
would
pierce
his
imperial
vitals
immediately
there
resounded
in
her
imagination
shouts
of
joy
the
gigantic
sigh
of
millions
of
women
freed
at
last
from
the
bloody
nightmare
thanks
to
her
playing
the
role
of
judith
or
charlotte
corday
or
a
blend
of
all
the
heroic
women
who
had
killed
for
the
common
weal
her
savage
fury
made
her
continue
her
imaginary
slaughter
dagger
in
hand
second
stroke
the
crown
prince
rolling
to
one
side
and
his
head
to
the
other
a
rain
of
dagger
thrusts
all
the
invincible
generals
of
whom
her
aunt
had
been
boasting
fleeing
with
their
insides
in
their
hands
and
bringing
up
the
rear
that
fawning
lackey
who
wished
to
receive
the
same
things
as
those
of
highest
rank
the
uncle
from
berlin
ay
if
she
could
only
get
the
chance
to
make
these
longings
a
reality
you
are
mad
protested
her
mother
completely
mad
how
can
a
ladylike
girl
talk
in
such
a
way
surprising
her
niece
in
the
ecstasy
of
these
delirious
ravings
dona
elena
would
raise
her
eyes
to
heaven
abstaining
thenceforth
from
communicating
her
opinions
reserving
them
wholly
for
the
mother
don
marcelo
s
indignation
took
another
bound
when
his
wife
repeated
to
him
the
news
from
her
sister
all
a
lie
the
war
was
progressing
finely
on
the
eastern
frontier
the
french
troops
had
advanced
through
the
interior
of
alsace
and
lorraine
but
belgium
is
invaded
isn
t
it
asked
dona
luisa
and
those
poor
belgians
desnoyers
retorted
indignantly
that
invasion
of
belgium
is
treason
and
a
treason
never
amounts
to
anything
among
decent
he
said
it
in
all
good
faith
as
though
war
were
a
duel
in
which
the
traitor
was
henceforth
ruled
out
and
unable
to
continue
his
outrages
besides
the
heroic
resistance
of
belgium
was
nourishing
the
most
absurd
illusions
in
his
heart
the
belgians
were
certainly
supernatural
men
destined
to
the
most
stupendous
achievements
and
to
think
that
heretofore
he
had
never
taken
this
plucky
little
nation
into
account
for
several
days
he
considered
liege
a
holy
city
before
whose
walls
the
teutonic
power
would
be
completely
confounded
upon
the
fall
of
liege
his
unquenchable
faith
sought
another
handle
there
were
still
remaining
many
other
lieges
in
the
interior
the
germans
might
force
their
way
further
in
then
we
would
see
how
many
of
them
ever
succeeded
in
getting
out
the
entry
into
brussels
did
not
disquiet
him
an
unprotected
city
its
surrender
was
a
foregone
conclusion
now
the
belgians
would
be
better
able
to
defend
antwerp
neither
did
the
advance
of
the
germans
toward
the
french
frontier
alarm
him
at
all
in
vain
his
with
malicious
brevity
mentioned
in
the
the
progress
of
the
invasion
so
confusedly
outlined
in
the
daily
papers
the
germans
were
already
at
the
frontier
and
what
of
that
yelled
don
marcelo
soon
they
will
meet
someone
to
talk
to
joffre
is
going
to
meet
them
our
armies
are
in
the
east
in
the
very
place
where
they
ought
to
be
on
the
true
frontier
at
the
door
of
their
home
but
they
have
to
deal
with
a
treacherous
and
cowardly
opponent
that
instead
of
marching
face
to
face
leaps
the
walls
of
the
corral
like
their
underhand
tricks
won
t
do
them
any
good
though
the
french
are
already
in
belgium
and
adjusting
the
accounts
of
the
germans
we
shall
smash
them
so
effectually
that
never
again
will
they
be
able
to
disturb
the
peace
of
the
world
and
that
accursed
individual
with
the
rampant
moustache
we
are
going
to
put
in
a
cage
and
exhibit
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
inspired
by
the
paternal
braggadocio
chichi
also
launched
forth
exultingly
an
imaginary
series
of
avenging
torments
and
insults
as
a
complement
to
this
imperial
exhibition
these
allusions
to
the
emperor
aggravated
frau
von
hartrott
more
than
anything
else
in
the
first
days
of
the
war
her
sister
had
surprised
her
weeping
before
the
newspaper
caricatures
and
leaflets
sold
in
the
streets
such
an
excellent
man
so
knightly
such
a
good
father
to
his
family
he
wasn
t
to
blame
for
anything
it
was
his
enemies
who
forced
him
to
assume
the
her
veneration
for
exalted
personages
was
making
her
take
the
attacks
upon
this
admired
grandee
as
though
they
were
directed
against
her
own
family
one
night
in
the
dining
room
she
abandoned
her
tragic
silence
certain
sarcasms
shot
by
desnoyers
at
her
hero
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
and
this
sentimental
indulgence
turned
her
thoughts
upon
her
sons
who
were
undoubtedly
taking
part
in
the
invasion
her
was
longing
for
the
extermination
of
all
the
enemy
may
every
barbarian
be
exterminated
every
one
of
the
bandits
in
pointed
helmets
who
have
just
burned
louvain
and
other
towns
shooting
defenceless
peasants
old
men
women
and
children
you
forget
that
i
am
a
mother
sobbed
frau
von
hartrott
you
forget
that
among
those
whose
extermination
you
are
imploring
are
my
her
violent
weeping
made
desnoyers
realize
more
than
ever
the
abyss
yawning
between
him
and
this
woman
lodged
in
his
own
house
his
resentment
however
overleapt
family
considerations
she
might
weep
for
her
sons
all
she
wanted
to
that
was
her
right
but
these
sons
were
aggressors
and
wantonly
doing
evil
it
was
the
other
mothers
who
were
inspiring
his
pity
those
who
were
living
tranquilly
in
their
smiling
little
belgian
towns
when
their
sons
were
suddenly
shot
down
their
daughters
violated
and
their
houses
burned
to
the
ground
as
though
this
description
of
the
horrors
of
war
were
a
fresh
insult
to
her
dona
elena
wept
harder
than
ever
what
falsehoods
the
kaiser
was
an
excellent
man
his
soldiers
were
gentlemen
the
german
army
was
a
model
of
civilization
and
goodness
her
husband
had
belonged
to
this
army
her
sons
were
marching
in
its
ranks
and
she
knew
her
sons
and
incapable
of
these
belgian
calumnies
she
could
no
longer
listen
to
and
with
dramatic
abandon
she
flung
herself
into
the
arms
of
her
sister
senor
desnoyers
raged
against
the
fate
that
condemned
him
to
live
under
the
same
roof
with
this
woman
what
an
unfortunate
complication
for
the
family
and
the
frontiers
were
closed
making
it
impossible
to
get
rid
of
her
very
well
then
he
thundered
let
us
talk
no
more
about
it
we
shall
never
reach
an
understanding
for
we
belong
to
two
different
worlds
it
s
a
great
pity
that
you
can
t
go
back
to
your
own
after
that
he
refrained
from
mentioning
the
war
in
his
s
presence
chichi
was
the
only
one
keeping
up
her
aggressive
and
noisy
enthusiasm
upon
reading
in
the
papers
the
news
of
the
shootings
sackings
burning
of
cities
and
the
dolorous
flight
of
those
who
had
seen
their
all
reduced
to
ashes
she
again
felt
the
necessity
of
assuming
the
role
of
ay
if
she
could
only
once
get
her
hands
on
one
of
those
bandits
what
did
the
men
amount
to
anyway
if
they
couldn
t
exterminate
the
whole
lot
then
she
would
look
at
rene
in
his
exquisitely
fresh
uniform
and
smiling
as
though
all
war
meant
to
him
was
a
mere
change
of
attire
and
she
would
exclaim
enigmatically
what
luck
that
you
will
never
have
to
go
to
the
front
how
fine
that
you
don
t
run
any
risks
and
her
lover
would
accept
these
words
as
but
another
proof
of
her
affectionate
interest
one
day
don
marcelo
was
able
to
appreciate
the
horrors
of
the
war
without
leaving
paris
three
thousand
belgian
refugees
were
quartered
provisionally
in
the
circus
before
being
distributed
among
the
provinces
when
desnoyers
entered
this
place
he
saw
in
the
vestibule
the
same
posters
which
had
been
flaunting
their
spectacular
gayeties
when
he
had
visited
it
a
few
months
before
with
his
family
now
he
noticed
the
odor
from
a
sick
and
miserable
multitude
crowded
together
like
the
exhalation
from
a
prison
or
poorhouse
infirmary
he
saw
a
throng
that
seemed
crazy
or
stupefied
with
grief
they
did
not
know
exactly
where
they
were
they
had
come
thither
they
didn
t
know
how
the
terrible
spectacle
of
the
invasion
was
still
so
persistent
in
their
minds
that
it
left
room
for
no
other
impression
they
were
still
seeing
the
helmeted
men
in
their
peaceful
hamlets
their
homes
in
flames
the
soldiery
firing
upon
those
who
were
fleeing
the
mutilated
women
done
to
death
by
incessant
adulterous
assault
the
old
men
burned
alive
the
children
stabbed
in
their
cradles
by
human
beasts
inflamed
by
alcohol
and
license
some
of
the
octogenarians
were
weeping
as
they
told
how
the
soldiers
of
a
civilized
nation
were
cutting
off
the
breasts
from
the
women
in
order
to
nail
them
to
the
doors
how
they
had
passed
around
as
a
trophy
a
babe
spiked
on
a
bayonet
how
they
had
shot
aged
men
in
the
very
armchair
in
which
they
were
huddled
in
their
sorrowful
weakness
torturing
them
first
with
their
jests
and
taunts
they
had
fled
blindly
pursued
by
fire
and
shot
as
crazed
with
terror
as
the
people
of
the
middle
ages
trying
not
to
be
ridden
down
by
the
hordes
of
galloping
huns
and
mongols
and
this
flight
had
been
across
the
country
in
its
loveliest
festal
array
in
the
most
productive
of
months
when
the
earth
was
bristling
with
ears
of
grain
when
the
august
sky
was
most
brilliant
and
when
the
birds
were
greeting
the
opulent
harvest
with
their
glad
songs
in
that
circus
filled
with
the
wandering
crowds
the
immense
crime
was
living
again
the
children
were
crying
with
a
sound
like
the
bleating
of
lambs
the
men
were
looking
wildly
around
with
terrified
eyes
the
frenzied
women
were
howling
like
the
insane
families
had
become
separated
in
the
terror
of
flight
a
mother
of
five
little
ones
now
had
but
one
the
parents
as
they
realized
the
number
missing
were
thinking
with
anguish
of
those
who
had
disappeared
would
they
ever
find
them
again
or
were
they
already
dead
don
marcelo
returned
home
grinding
his
teeth
and
waving
his
cane
in
an
alarming
manner
ah
the
bandits
if
only
his
could
change
her
sex
why
wasn
t
she
a
man
it
would
be
better
still
if
she
could
suddenly
assume
the
form
of
her
husband
von
hartrott
what
an
interesting
interview
the
two
would
have
the
war
was
awakening
religious
sentiment
in
the
men
and
increasing
the
devotion
of
the
women
the
churches
were
filled
dona
luisa
was
no
longer
confining
herself
to
those
of
her
neighborhood
with
the
courage
induced
by
extraordinary
events
she
was
traversing
paris
afoot
and
going
from
the
madeleine
to
notre
dame
or
to
the
sacre
coeur
on
the
heights
of
montmartre
religious
festivals
were
now
thronged
like
popular
assemblies
the
preachers
were
tribunes
patriotic
enthusiasm
interrupted
many
sermon
with
applause
each
morning
on
opening
the
papers
before
reading
the
war
news
senora
desnoyers
would
hunt
other
notices
where
was
father
amette
going
to
be
then
under
the
arched
vaultings
of
that
temple
would
she
unite
her
voice
with
the
devout
chorus
imploring
supernatural
intervention
lord
save
france
patriotic
religiosity
was
putting
sainte
genevieve
at
the
head
of
the
favored
ones
so
from
all
these
fiestas
dona
luisa
tremulous
with
faith
would
return
in
expectation
of
a
miracle
similar
to
that
which
the
patron
saint
of
paris
had
worked
before
the
invading
hordes
of
attila
dona
elena
was
also
visiting
the
churches
but
those
nearest
the
house
her
saw
her
one
afternoon
entering
d
eylau
the
building
was
filled
with
the
faithful
and
on
the
altar
was
a
sheaf
of
flags
france
and
the
allied
nations
the
imploring
crowd
was
not
composed
entirely
of
women
desnoyers
saw
men
of
his
age
pompous
and
grave
moving
their
lips
and
fixing
steadfast
eyes
on
the
altar
on
which
were
reflected
like
lost
stars
the
flames
of
the
candles
and
again
he
felt
envy
they
were
fathers
who
were
recalling
their
childhood
prayers
thinking
of
their
sons
in
battle
don
marcelo
who
had
always
considered
religion
with
indifference
suddenly
recognized
the
necessity
of
faith
he
wanted
to
pray
like
the
others
with
a
vague
indefinite
supplication
including
all
beings
who
were
struggling
and
dying
for
a
land
that
he
had
not
tried
to
defend
he
was
scandalized
to
see
von
hartrott
s
wife
kneeling
among
these
people
raising
her
eyes
to
the
cross
in
a
look
of
anguished
entreaty
she
was
begging
heaven
to
protect
her
husband
the
german
who
perhaps
at
this
moment
was
concentrating
all
his
devilish
faculties
on
the
best
organization
for
crushing
the
weak
she
was
praying
for
her
sons
officers
of
the
king
of
prussia
who
revolver
in
hand
were
entering
villages
and
farmlands
driving
before
them
a
crowd
leaving
behind
them
fire
and
death
and
these
orisons
were
going
to
mingle
with
those
of
the
mothers
who
were
praying
for
the
youth
trying
to
check
the
onslaught
of
the
barbarians
with
the
petitions
of
these
earnest
men
rigid
in
their
tragic
grief
he
had
to
make
a
great
effort
not
to
protest
aloud
and
he
left
the
church
his
had
no
right
to
kneel
there
among
those
people
they
ought
to
put
her
out
he
growled
indignantly
she
is
compromising
god
with
her
absurd
but
in
spite
of
his
annoyance
he
had
to
endure
her
living
in
his
household
and
at
the
same
time
had
taken
great
pains
to
prevent
her
nationality
being
known
outside
it
was
a
severe
trial
for
don
marcelo
to
be
obliged
to
keep
silent
when
at
table
with
his
family
he
had
to
avoid
the
hysterics
of
his
who
promptly
burst
into
sighs
and
sobs
at
the
slightest
allusion
to
her
hero
and
he
feared
equally
the
complaints
of
his
wife
always
ready
to
defend
her
sister
as
though
she
were
the
victim
that
a
man
in
his
own
home
should
have
to
curb
his
tongue
and
speak
tactfully
the
only
satisfaction
permitted
him
was
to
announce
the
military
moves
the
french
had
entered
belgium
it
appears
that
the
boches
have
had
a
good
the
slightest
clash
of
cavalry
a
simple
encounter
with
the
advance
troops
he
would
glorify
as
a
decisive
victory
in
lorraine
too
we
are
making
great
headway
but
suddenly
the
fountain
of
his
bubbling
optimism
seemed
to
become
choked
up
to
judge
from
the
periodicals
nothing
extraordinary
was
occurring
they
continued
publishing
so
as
to
keep
enthusiasm
at
but
nothing
definite
the
government
too
was
issuing
communications
of
vague
and
rhetorical
verbosity
desnoyers
became
alarmed
his
instinct
warning
him
of
danger
there
is
something
wrong
he
thought
there
s
a
spring
broken
somewhere
this
lack
of
encouraging
news
coincided
exactly
with
the
sudden
rise
in
dona
elena
s
spirits
with
whom
had
that
woman
been
talking
whom
did
she
meet
when
she
was
on
the
street
without
dropping
her
pose
as
a
martyr
with
the
same
woebegone
look
and
drooping
mouth
she
was
talking
and
talking
treacherously
the
torment
of
don
marcelo
in
being
obliged
to
listen
to
the
enemy
harbored
within
his
gates
the
french
had
been
vanquished
in
lorraine
and
in
belgium
at
the
same
time
a
body
of
the
army
had
deserted
the
colors
many
prisoners
many
cannon
were
captured
lies
german
exaggerations
howled
desnoyers
and
chichi
with
the
derisive
s
of
an
insolent
girl
drowned
out
the
triumphant
communications
of
the
aunt
from
berlin
i
don
t
know
of
course
said
the
unwelcome
lodger
with
mock
humility
perhaps
it
is
not
authentic
i
have
heard
it
her
host
was
furious
where
had
she
heard
it
said
who
was
giving
her
such
news
and
in
order
to
ventilate
his
wrath
he
broke
forth
into
tirades
against
the
enemy
s
espionage
against
the
carelessness
of
the
police
force
in
permitting
so
many
germans
to
remain
hidden
in
paris
then
he
suddenly
became
quiet
thinking
of
his
own
behavior
in
this
line
he
too
was
involuntarily
contributing
toward
the
maintenance
and
support
of
the
foe
the
fall
of
the
ministry
and
the
constitution
of
a
government
of
national
defense
made
it
apparent
that
something
very
important
must
have
taken
place
the
alarms
and
tears
of
dona
luisa
increased
his
nervousness
the
good
lady
was
no
longer
returning
from
the
churches
cheered
and
strengthened
her
confidential
talks
with
her
sister
were
filling
her
with
a
terror
that
she
tried
in
vain
to
communicate
to
her
husband
all
is
lost
elena
is
the
only
one
that
knows
the
desnoyers
went
in
search
of
senator
lacour
he
would
know
all
the
ministers
no
one
could
be
better
informed
yes
my
friend
said
the
important
man
sadly
two
great
losses
at
morhange
and
charleroi
at
the
east
and
the
north
the
enemy
is
going
to
invade
french
soil
but
our
army
is
intact
and
will
retreat
in
good
order
good
fortune
may
still
be
ours
a
great
calamity
but
all
is
not
preparations
for
the
defense
of
paris
were
being
pushed
forward
rather
late
the
forts
were
supplying
themselves
with
new
cannon
houses
built
in
the
danger
zone
in
the
piping
times
of
peace
were
now
disappearing
under
the
blows
of
the
official
demolition
the
trees
on
the
outer
avenues
were
being
felled
in
order
to
enlarge
the
horizon
barricades
of
sacks
of
earth
and
tree
trunks
were
heaped
at
the
doors
of
the
old
walls
the
curious
were
skirting
the
suburbs
in
order
to
gaze
at
the
recently
dug
trenches
and
the
barbed
wire
fences
the
bois
de
boulogne
was
filled
with
herds
of
cattle
near
heaps
of
dry
alfalfa
steers
and
sheep
were
grouped
in
the
green
meadows
protection
against
famine
was
uppermost
in
the
minds
of
a
people
still
remembering
the
suffering
of
every
night
the
street
lighting
was
less
and
less
the
sky
on
the
other
hand
was
streaked
incessantly
by
the
shafts
from
the
searchlights
fear
of
aerial
invasion
was
increasing
the
public
uneasiness
timid
people
were
speaking
of
zeppelins
attributing
to
them
irresistible
powers
with
all
the
exaggeration
that
accompanies
mysterious
dangers
in
her
panic
dona
luisa
greatly
distressed
her
husband
who
was
passing
the
days
in
continual
alarm
yet
trying
to
put
heart
into
his
trembling
and
anxious
wife
they
are
going
to
come
marcelo
my
heart
tells
me
so
the
girl
the
girl
she
was
accepting
blindly
all
the
statements
made
by
her
sister
the
only
thing
that
comforted
her
being
the
chivalry
and
discipline
of
those
troops
to
which
her
nephews
belonged
the
news
of
the
atrocities
committed
against
the
women
of
belgium
were
received
with
the
same
credulity
as
the
enemy
s
advances
announced
by
elena
our
girl
marcelo
our
girl
and
the
girl
object
of
so
much
solicitude
would
laugh
with
the
assurance
of
vigorous
youth
on
hearing
of
her
mother
s
anxiety
just
let
the
shameless
fellows
come
i
shall
take
great
pleasure
in
seeing
them
face
to
face
and
she
clenched
her
right
hand
as
though
it
already
clutched
the
avenging
knife
the
father
became
tired
of
this
situation
he
still
had
one
of
his
monumental
automobiles
that
an
outside
chauffeur
could
manage
senator
lacour
obtained
the
necessary
passports
and
desnoyers
gave
his
wife
her
orders
in
a
tone
that
admitted
of
no
remonstrance
they
must
go
to
biarritz
or
to
some
of
the
summer
resorts
in
the
north
of
spain
almost
all
the
south
american
families
had
already
gone
in
the
same
direction
dona
luisa
tried
to
object
it
was
impossible
for
her
to
separate
herself
from
her
husband
never
before
in
their
many
years
of
married
life
had
they
once
been
separated
but
a
harsh
negative
from
don
marcelo
cut
her
pleadings
short
he
would
remain
then
the
poor
senora
ran
to
the
rue
de
la
pompe
her
son
julio
scarcely
listened
to
his
mother
ay
he
too
would
stay
so
finally
the
imposing
automobile
lumbered
toward
the
south
carrying
dona
luisa
her
sister
who
hailed
with
delight
this
withdrawal
before
the
admired
troops
of
the
emperor
and
chichi
pleased
that
the
war
was
necessitating
an
excursion
to
the
fashionable
beaches
frequented
by
her
friends
don
marcelo
was
at
last
alone
the
two
coppery
maids
had
followed
by
rail
the
flight
of
their
mistresses
at
first
the
old
man
felt
a
little
bewildered
by
this
solitude
which
obliged
him
to
eat
uncomfortable
meals
in
a
restaurant
and
pass
the
nights
in
enormous
and
deserted
rooms
still
bearing
traces
of
their
former
occupants
the
other
apartments
in
the
building
had
also
been
vacated
all
the
tenants
were
foreigners
who
had
discreetly
decamped
or
french
families
surprised
by
the
war
when
summering
at
their
country
seats
instinctively
he
turned
his
steps
toward
the
rue
de
la
pompe
gazing
from
afar
at
the
studio
windows
what
was
his
son
doing
undoubtedly
continuing
his
gay
and
useless
life
such
men
only
existed
for
their
own
selfish
folly
desnoyers
felt
satisfied
with
the
stand
he
had
taken
to
follow
the
family
would
be
sheer
cowardice
the
memory
of
his
youthful
flight
to
south
america
was
sufficient
martyrdom
he
would
finish
his
life
with
all
the
compensating
bravery
that
he
could
muster
no
they
will
not
come
he
said
repeatedly
with
the
optimism
of
enthusiasm
i
have
a
presentiment
that
they
will
never
reach
paris
and
even
if
they
do
come
the
absence
of
his
family
brought
him
a
joyous
valor
and
a
sense
of
bold
youthfulness
although
his
age
might
prevent
his
going
to
war
in
the
open
air
he
could
still
fire
a
gun
immovable
in
a
trench
without
fear
of
death
let
them
come
he
was
longing
for
the
struggle
with
the
anxiety
of
a
punctilious
business
man
wishing
to
cancel
a
former
debt
as
soon
as
possible
in
the
streets
of
paris
he
met
many
groups
of
fugitives
they
were
from
the
north
and
east
of
france
and
had
escaped
before
the
german
advance
of
all
the
tales
told
by
this
despondent
crowd
not
knowing
where
to
go
and
dependent
upon
the
charity
of
the
people
he
was
most
impressed
with
those
dealing
with
the
disregard
of
property
shootings
and
assassinations
made
him
clench
his
fists
with
threats
of
vengeance
but
the
robberies
authorized
by
the
heads
the
wholesale
sackings
by
superior
order
followed
by
fire
appeared
to
him
so
that
he
was
silent
with
stupefaction
his
speech
seeming
to
be
temporarily
paralyzed
and
a
people
with
laws
could
wage
war
in
this
fashion
like
a
tribe
of
indians
going
to
combat
in
order
to
rob
his
adoration
of
property
rights
made
him
beside
himself
with
wrath
at
these
sacrileges
he
began
to
worry
about
his
castle
at
villeblanche
all
that
he
owned
in
paris
suddenly
seemed
to
him
of
slight
importance
to
what
he
had
in
his
historic
mansion
his
best
paintings
were
there
adorning
the
gloomy
salons
there
too
the
furnishings
captured
from
the
antiquarians
after
an
auctioneering
battle
and
the
crystal
cabinets
the
tapestries
the
silver
services
he
mentally
reviewed
all
of
these
objects
not
letting
a
single
one
escape
his
inventory
things
that
he
had
forgotten
came
surging
up
in
his
memory
and
the
fear
of
losing
them
seemed
to
give
them
greater
lustre
increasing
their
size
and
intensifying
their
value
all
the
riches
of
villeblanche
were
concentrated
in
one
certain
acquisition
which
desnoyers
admired
most
of
all
for
to
his
mind
it
stood
for
all
the
glory
of
his
immense
fortune
in
fact
the
most
luxurious
appointment
that
even
a
millionaire
could
possess
my
golden
bath
he
thought
i
have
there
my
tub
of
this
bath
of
priceless
metal
he
had
procured
after
much
financial
wrestling
from
an
auction
and
he
considered
the
purchase
the
culminating
achievement
of
his
wealth
no
one
knew
exactly
its
origin
perhaps
it
had
been
the
property
of
luxurious
princes
perhaps
it
owed
its
existence
to
the
caprice
of
a
fond
of
display
he
and
his
had
woven
a
legend
around
this
golden
cavity
adorned
with
lions
claws
dolphins
and
busts
of
naiads
undoubtedly
it
was
once
a
king
s
chichi
gravely
affirmed
that
it
had
been
marie
antoinette
s
and
the
entire
family
thought
that
the
home
on
the
avenue
victor
hugo
was
altogether
too
modest
and
plebeian
to
enshrine
such
a
jewel
they
therefore
agreed
to
put
it
in
the
castle
where
it
was
greatly
venerated
although
it
was
useless
and
solemn
as
a
museum
piece
and
was
he
to
permit
the
enemy
in
their
advance
toward
the
marne
to
carry
off
this
priceless
treasure
as
well
as
the
other
gorgeous
things
which
he
had
accumulated
with
such
patience
ah
no
his
soul
of
a
collector
would
be
capable
of
the
greatest
heroism
before
he
would
let
that
go
each
day
was
bringing
a
fresh
sheaf
of
bad
news
the
papers
were
saying
little
and
the
government
was
so
veiling
its
communications
that
the
mind
was
left
in
great
perplexity
nevertheless
the
truth
was
mysteriously
forcing
its
way
impelled
by
the
pessimism
of
the
alarmists
and
the
manipulation
of
the
enemy
s
spies
who
were
remaining
hidden
in
paris
the
fatal
news
was
being
passed
along
in
whispers
they
have
already
crossed
the
frontier
they
are
already
in
they
were
advancing
at
the
rate
of
miles
a
day
the
name
of
von
kluck
was
beginning
to
have
a
familiar
ring
english
and
french
were
retreating
before
the
enveloping
progression
of
the
invaders
some
were
expecting
another
sedan
desnoyers
was
following
the
advance
of
the
germans
going
daily
to
the
gare
du
nord
every
hours
was
lessening
the
radius
of
travel
bulletins
announcing
that
tickets
would
not
be
sold
for
the
northern
districts
served
to
indicate
how
these
places
were
falling
one
after
the
other
into
the
power
of
the
invader
the
shrinkage
of
national
territory
was
going
on
with
such
methodical
regularity
that
with
watch
in
hand
and
allowing
an
advance
of
miles
daily
one
might
gauge
the
hour
when
the
lances
of
the
first
uhlans
would
salute
the
eiffel
tower
the
trains
were
running
full
great
bunches
of
people
overflowing
from
their
coaches
in
this
time
of
greatest
anxiety
desnoyers
again
visited
his
friend
senator
lacour
in
order
to
astound
him
with
the
most
petitions
he
wished
to
go
immediately
to
his
castle
while
everybody
else
was
fleeing
toward
paris
he
earnestly
desired
to
go
in
the
opposite
direction
the
senator
couldn
t
believe
his
ears
you
are
beside
yourself
he
exclaimed
it
is
necessary
to
leave
paris
but
toward
the
south
i
will
tell
you
confidentially
and
you
must
not
tell
because
it
is
a
secret
we
are
leaving
at
any
minute
we
are
all
going
the
president
the
government
the
chambers
we
are
going
to
establish
ourselves
at
bordeaux
as
in
the
enemy
is
surely
approaching
it
is
only
a
matter
of
days
of
hours
we
know
little
of
just
what
is
happening
but
all
the
news
is
bad
the
army
still
holds
firm
is
yet
intact
but
retreating
retreating
all
the
time
yielding
ground
believe
me
it
will
be
better
for
you
to
leave
paris
gallieni
will
defend
it
but
the
defense
is
going
to
be
hard
and
horrible
although
paris
may
surrender
france
will
not
necessarily
surrender
the
war
will
go
on
if
necessary
even
to
the
frontiers
of
spain
but
it
is
sad
very
sad
and
he
offered
to
take
his
friend
with
him
in
that
flight
to
bordeaux
of
which
so
few
yet
knew
desnoyers
shook
his
head
no
he
wanted
to
go
the
castle
of
villeblanche
his
furniture
his
riches
his
parks
but
you
will
be
taken
prisoner
protested
the
senator
perhaps
they
will
kill
you
a
shrug
of
indifference
was
the
only
response
he
considered
himself
energetic
enough
to
struggle
against
the
entire
german
army
in
the
defense
of
his
property
the
important
thing
was
to
get
there
and
then
just
let
anybody
dare
to
touch
his
things
the
senator
looked
with
astonishment
at
this
civilian
infuriated
by
the
lust
of
possession
it
reminded
him
of
some
arab
merchants
that
he
had
once
known
ordinarily
mild
and
pacific
who
quarrelled
and
killed
like
wild
beasts
when
bedouin
thieves
seized
their
wares
this
was
not
the
moment
for
discussion
and
each
must
map
out
his
own
course
so
the
influential
senator
finally
yielded
to
the
desire
of
his
friend
if
such
was
his
pleasure
let
him
carry
it
through
so
he
arranged
that
his
mad
petitioner
should
depart
that
very
night
on
a
military
train
that
was
going
to
meet
the
army
that
journey
put
don
marcelo
in
touch
with
the
extraordinary
movement
which
the
war
had
developed
on
the
railroads
his
train
took
fourteen
hours
to
cover
the
distance
normally
made
in
two
it
was
made
up
of
freight
cars
filled
with
provisions
and
cartridges
with
the
doors
stamped
and
sealed
a
car
was
occupied
by
the
train
escort
a
detachment
of
provincial
guards
he
was
installed
in
a
compartment
with
the
lieutenant
in
command
of
this
guard
and
certain
officials
on
their
way
to
join
their
regiments
after
having
completed
the
business
of
mobilization
in
the
small
towns
in
which
they
were
stationed
before
the
war
the
crowd
habituated
to
long
detentions
was
accustomed
to
getting
out
and
settling
down
before
the
motionless
locomotive
or
scattering
through
the
nearby
fields
in
the
stations
of
any
importance
all
the
tracks
were
occupied
by
rows
of
cars
engines
were
whistling
impatient
to
be
off
groups
of
soldiers
were
hesitating
before
the
different
trains
making
mistakes
getting
out
of
one
coach
to
enter
others
the
employees
calm
but
were
going
from
side
to
side
giving
explanations
about
mountains
of
all
sorts
of
freight
and
arranging
them
for
transport
in
the
convoy
in
which
desnoyers
was
placed
the
territorials
were
sleeping
accustomed
to
the
monotony
of
acting
as
guard
those
in
charge
of
the
horses
had
opened
the
sliding
doors
seating
themselves
on
the
floor
with
their
legs
hanging
over
the
edge
the
train
went
very
slowly
during
the
night
across
shadowy
fields
stopping
here
and
there
before
red
lanterns
and
announcing
its
presence
by
prolonged
whistling
in
some
stations
appeared
young
girls
clad
in
white
with
cockades
and
pennants
on
their
breasts
day
and
night
they
were
there
in
relays
so
that
no
train
should
pass
through
without
a
visit
they
offered
in
baskets
and
trays
their
gifts
to
the
soldiers
bread
chocolate
fruit
many
already
surfeited
tried
to
resist
but
had
to
yield
eventually
before
the
pleading
countenance
of
the
maidens
even
desnoyers
was
laden
down
with
these
gifts
of
patriotic
enthusiasm
he
passed
a
great
part
of
the
night
talking
with
his
travelling
companions
only
the
officers
had
vague
directions
as
to
where
they
were
to
meet
their
regiments
for
the
operations
of
war
were
daily
changing
the
situation
faithful
to
duty
they
were
passing
on
hoping
to
arrive
in
time
for
the
decisive
combat
the
chief
of
the
guard
had
been
over
the
ground
and
was
the
only
one
able
to
give
any
account
of
the
retreat
after
each
stop
the
train
made
less
progress
everybody
appeared
confused
why
the
retreat
the
army
had
undoubtedly
suffered
reverses
but
it
was
still
united
and
in
his
opinion
ought
to
seek
an
engagement
where
it
was
the
retreat
was
leaving
the
advance
of
the
enemy
unopposed
to
what
point
were
they
going
to
retreat
they
who
two
weeks
before
were
discussing
in
their
garrisons
the
place
in
belgium
where
their
adversaries
were
going
to
receive
their
death
blow
and
through
what
places
their
victorious
troops
would
invade
germany
their
admission
of
the
change
of
tactics
did
not
reveal
the
slightest
discouragement
an
indefinite
but
firm
hope
was
hovering
triumphantly
above
their
vacillations
the
generalissimo
was
the
only
one
who
possessed
the
secret
of
events
and
desnoyers
approved
with
the
blind
enthusiasm
inspired
by
those
in
whom
we
have
confidence
joffre
that
serious
and
calm
leader
would
finally
bring
things
out
all
right
nobody
ought
to
doubt
his
ability
he
was
the
kind
of
man
who
always
says
the
decisive
word
at
daybreak
don
marcelo
left
the
train
good
luck
to
you
and
he
clasped
the
hands
of
the
brave
young
fellows
who
were
going
to
die
perhaps
in
a
very
short
time
finding
the
road
unexpectedly
open
the
train
started
immediately
and
desnoyers
found
himself
alone
in
the
station
in
normal
times
a
branch
road
would
have
taken
him
on
to
villeblanche
but
the
service
was
now
suspended
for
lack
of
a
train
crew
the
employees
had
been
transferred
to
the
lines
crowded
with
the
war
transportation
in
vain
he
sought
with
most
generous
offers
a
horse
a
simple
cart
drawn
by
any
kind
of
old
beast
in
order
to
continue
his
trip
the
mobilization
had
appropriated
the
best
and
all
other
means
of
transportation
had
disappeared
with
the
flight
of
the
terrified
he
would
have
to
walk
the
eight
miles
the
old
man
did
not
hesitate
forward
march
and
he
began
his
course
along
the
dusty
straight
white
highway
running
between
an
endless
succession
of
plains
some
groups
of
trees
some
green
hedges
and
the
roofs
of
various
farms
broke
the
monotony
of
the
countryside
the
fields
were
covered
with
stubble
from
the
recent
harvest
the
haycocks
dotted
the
ground
with
their
yellowish
cones
now
beginning
to
darken
and
take
on
a
tone
of
oxidized
gold
in
the
valleys
the
birds
were
flitting
about
shaking
off
the
dew
of
dawn
the
first
rays
of
the
sun
announced
a
very
hot
day
around
the
hay
stacks
desnoyers
saw
knots
of
people
who
were
getting
up
shaking
out
their
clothes
and
awaking
those
who
were
still
sleeping
they
were
fugitives
camping
near
the
station
in
the
hope
that
some
train
would
carry
them
further
on
they
knew
not
where
some
had
come
from
districts
they
had
heard
the
cannon
had
seen
war
approaching
and
for
several
days
had
been
going
forward
directed
by
chance
others
infected
with
the
contagion
of
panic
had
fled
fearing
to
know
the
same
horrors
among
them
he
saw
mothers
with
their
little
ones
in
their
arms
and
old
men
who
could
only
walk
with
a
cane
in
one
hand
and
the
other
arm
in
that
of
some
member
of
the
family
and
a
few
old
women
withered
and
motionless
as
mummies
who
were
sleeping
as
they
were
trundled
along
in
wheelbarrows
when
the
sun
awoke
this
miserable
band
they
gathered
themselves
together
with
heavy
step
still
stiffened
by
the
night
many
were
going
toward
the
station
in
the
hope
of
a
train
which
never
came
thinking
that
perhaps
they
might
have
better
luck
during
the
day
that
was
just
dawning
some
were
continuing
their
way
down
the
track
hoping
that
fate
might
be
more
propitious
in
some
other
place
don
marcelo
walked
all
the
morning
long
the
white
rectilinear
ribbon
of
roadway
was
spotted
with
approaching
groups
that
on
the
horizon
line
looked
like
a
file
of
ants
he
did
not
see
a
single
person
going
in
his
direction
all
were
fleeing
toward
the
south
and
on
meeting
this
city
gentleman
with
walking
stick
and
straw
hat
going
on
alone
toward
the
country
which
they
were
abandoning
in
terror
they
showed
the
greatest
astonishment
they
concluded
that
he
must
be
some
functionary
some
celebrity
from
the
government
at
midday
he
was
able
to
get
a
bit
of
bread
a
little
cheese
and
a
bottle
of
white
wine
from
a
tavern
near
the
road
the
proprietor
was
at
the
front
his
wife
sick
and
moaning
in
her
bed
the
mother
a
rather
deaf
old
woman
surrounded
by
her
grandchildren
was
watching
from
the
doorway
the
procession
of
fugitives
which
had
been
filing
by
for
the
last
three
days
monsieur
why
do
they
flee
she
said
to
desnoyers
war
only
concerns
the
soldiers
we
countryfolk
have
done
no
wrong
to
anybody
and
we
ought
not
to
be
four
hours
later
on
descending
one
of
the
hills
that
bounded
the
valley
of
the
marne
he
saw
afar
the
roofs
of
villeblanche
clustered
around
the
church
and
further
on
beyond
a
little
grove
the
slatey
points
of
the
round
towers
of
his
castle
the
streets
of
the
village
were
deserted
only
on
the
outer
edges
of
the
square
did
he
see
some
old
women
sitting
as
in
the
placid
evenings
of
bygone
summers
half
of
the
neighborhood
had
fled
the
others
were
staying
by
their
firesides
through
sedentary
routine
or
deceiving
themselves
with
a
blind
optimism
if
the
prussians
should
approach
what
could
they
do
to
them
they
would
obey
their
orders
without
attempting
any
resistance
and
it
is
impossible
to
punish
people
who
obey
anything
would
be
preferable
to
losing
the
homes
built
by
their
forefathers
which
they
had
never
left
in
the
square
he
saw
the
mayor
and
the
principal
inhabitants
grouped
together
like
the
women
they
all
stared
in
astonishment
at
the
owner
of
the
castle
he
was
the
most
unexpected
of
apparitions
while
so
many
were
fleeing
toward
paris
this
parisian
had
come
to
join
them
and
share
in
their
fate
a
smile
of
affection
a
look
of
sympathy
began
to
appear
on
the
rough
countenances
of
the
suspicious
rustics
for
a
long
time
desnoyers
had
been
on
bad
terms
with
the
entire
village
he
had
harshly
insisted
on
his
rights
showing
no
tolerance
in
matters
touching
his
property
he
had
spoken
many
times
of
bringing
suit
against
the
mayor
and
sending
half
of
the
neighborhood
to
prison
so
his
enemies
had
retaliated
by
treacherously
invading
his
lands
poaching
in
his
hunting
preserves
and
causing
him
great
trouble
with
and
involved
claims
his
hatred
of
the
community
had
even
united
him
with
the
priest
because
he
was
on
terms
of
permanent
hostility
with
the
mayor
but
his
relations
with
the
church
turned
out
as
fruitless
as
his
struggles
with
the
state
the
priest
was
a
kindly
old
soul
who
bore
a
certain
resemblance
to
renan
and
seemed
interested
only
in
getting
alms
for
his
poor
out
of
don
marcelo
even
carrying
his
boldness
so
far
as
to
try
to
excuse
the
marauders
on
his
property
how
remote
these
struggles
of
a
few
months
ago
now
seemed
to
him
the
millionaire
was
greatly
surprised
to
see
the
priest
on
leaving
his
house
to
enter
the
church
greet
the
mayor
as
he
passed
with
a
friendly
smile
after
long
years
of
hostile
silence
they
had
met
on
the
evening
of
august
first
at
the
foot
of
the
church
tower
the
bell
was
ringing
the
alarm
announcing
the
mobilization
to
the
men
who
were
in
the
field
and
the
two
enemies
had
instinctively
clasped
hands
all
french
this
affectionate
unanimity
also
came
to
meet
the
detested
owner
of
the
castle
he
had
to
exchange
greetings
first
on
one
side
then
on
the
other
grasping
many
a
horny
hand
behind
his
back
the
people
broke
out
into
kindly
excuses
a
good
man
with
no
fault
except
a
little
bad
temper
and
in
a
few
minutes
monsieur
desnoyers
was
basking
in
the
delightful
atmosphere
of
popularity
as
the
old
gentleman
approached
his
castle
he
concluded
that
although
the
fatigue
of
the
long
walk
was
making
his
knees
tremble
the
trip
had
been
well
worth
while
never
had
his
park
appeared
to
him
so
extensive
and
so
majestic
as
in
that
summer
twilight
never
so
glistening
white
the
swans
that
were
gliding
double
over
the
quiet
waters
never
so
imposing
the
great
group
of
towers
whose
inverted
images
were
repeated
in
the
glassy
green
of
the
moats
he
felt
eager
to
see
at
once
the
stables
with
their
herds
of
animals
then
a
brief
glance
showed
him
that
the
stalls
were
comparatively
empty
mobilization
had
carried
off
his
best
work
horses
the
driving
and
riding
horses
also
had
disappeared
those
in
charge
of
the
grounds
and
the
various
stable
boys
were
also
in
the
army
the
warden
a
man
upwards
of
fifty
and
consumptive
was
the
only
one
of
the
personnel
left
at
the
castle
with
his
wife
and
daughter
he
was
keeping
the
mangers
filled
and
from
time
to
time
was
milking
the
neglected
cows
within
the
noble
edifice
he
again
congratulated
himself
on
the
adamantine
will
which
had
brought
him
thither
how
could
he
ever
give
up
such
riches
he
gloated
over
the
paintings
the
crystals
the
draperies
all
bathed
in
gold
by
the
splendor
of
the
dying
day
and
he
felt
more
than
proud
to
be
their
possessor
this
pride
awakened
in
him
an
absurd
impossible
courage
as
though
he
were
a
gigantic
being
from
another
planet
and
all
humanity
merely
an
ant
hill
that
he
could
grind
under
foot
just
let
the
enemy
come
he
could
hold
his
own
against
the
whole
lot
then
when
his
common
sense
brought
him
out
of
his
heroic
delirium
he
tried
to
calm
himself
with
an
equally
illogical
optimism
they
would
not
come
he
did
not
know
why
it
was
but
his
heart
told
him
that
they
would
not
get
that
far
he
passed
the
following
morning
reconnoitering
the
artificial
meadows
that
he
had
made
behind
the
park
lamenting
their
neglected
condition
due
to
the
departure
of
the
men
trying
himself
to
open
the
sluice
gates
so
as
to
give
some
water
to
the
pasture
lands
which
were
beginning
to
dry
up
the
grape
vines
were
extending
their
branches
the
length
of
their
supports
and
the
full
bunches
nearly
ripe
were
beginning
to
show
their
triangular
lusciousness
among
the
leaves
ay
who
would
gather
this
abundant
fruit
by
afternoon
he
noted
an
extraordinary
amount
of
movement
in
the
village
georgette
the
warden
s
daughter
brought
the
news
that
many
enormous
automobiles
and
soldiers
french
soldiers
were
beginning
to
pass
through
the
main
street
in
a
little
while
a
procession
began
filing
past
on
the
high
road
near
the
castle
leading
to
the
bridge
over
the
marne
this
was
composed
of
motor
trucks
open
and
closed
that
still
had
their
old
commercial
signs
under
their
covering
of
dust
and
spots
of
mud
many
of
them
displayed
the
names
of
business
firms
in
paris
others
the
names
of
provincial
establishments
with
these
industrial
vehicles
requisitioned
by
mobilization
were
others
from
the
public
service
which
produced
in
desnoyers
the
same
effect
as
a
familiar
face
in
a
throng
of
strangers
on
their
upper
parts
were
the
names
of
their
old
routes
etc
probably
he
had
travelled
many
times
in
these
very
vehicles
now
shabby
and
aged
by
twenty
days
of
intense
activity
with
dented
planks
and
twisted
metal
perforated
like
sieves
but
rattling
crazily
on
some
of
the
conveyances
displayed
white
discs
with
a
red
cross
in
the
center
others
had
certain
letters
and
figures
comprehensible
only
to
those
initiates
in
the
secrets
of
military
administration
within
these
vehicles
the
only
new
and
strong
motors
he
saw
soldiers
many
soldiers
but
all
wounded
with
head
and
legs
bandaged
ashy
faces
made
still
more
tragic
by
their
growing
beards
feverish
eyes
looking
fixedly
ahead
mouths
so
sadly
immobile
that
they
seemed
carven
by
agonizing
groans
doctors
and
nurses
were
occupying
various
carriages
in
this
convoy
escorted
by
several
platoons
of
horsemen
and
mingled
with
the
slowly
moving
horses
and
automobiles
were
marching
groups
of
with
cloaks
unbuttoned
or
hanging
from
their
shoulders
like
capes
wounded
men
who
were
able
to
walk
and
joke
and
sing
some
with
arms
in
splints
across
their
breasts
others
with
bandaged
heads
with
clotted
blood
showing
through
the
thin
white
strips
the
millionaire
longed
to
do
something
for
these
brave
fellows
but
he
had
hardly
begun
to
distribute
some
bottles
of
wine
and
loaves
of
bread
before
a
doctor
interposed
upbraiding
him
as
though
he
had
committed
a
crime
his
gifts
might
result
fatally
so
he
had
to
stand
beside
the
road
sad
and
helpless
looking
after
the
sorrowful
convoy
by
nightfall
the
vehicles
filled
with
the
sick
were
no
longer
filing
by
he
now
saw
hundreds
of
drays
some
hermetically
sealed
with
the
prudence
that
explosive
material
requires
others
with
bundles
and
boxes
that
were
sending
out
a
stale
odor
of
provisions
then
came
great
herds
of
cattle
raising
thick
whirling
clouds
of
dust
in
the
narrow
parts
of
the
road
prodded
on
by
the
sticks
and
yells
of
the
shepherds
in
kepis
his
thoughts
kept
him
wakeful
all
night
this
then
was
the
retreat
of
which
the
people
of
paris
were
talking
but
in
which
many
wished
not
to
believe
the
retreat
reaching
even
there
and
continuing
its
indefinite
retirement
since
nobody
knew
what
its
end
might
be
his
optimism
aroused
a
ridiculous
hope
perhaps
this
was
only
the
retreat
of
the
hospitals
and
stores
which
always
follows
an
army
the
troops
wishing
to
be
rid
of
impedimenta
were
sending
them
forward
by
railway
and
highway
that
must
be
it
so
all
through
the
night
he
interpreted
the
incessant
bustle
as
the
passing
of
vehicles
filled
with
the
wounded
with
munitions
and
eatables
like
those
which
had
filed
by
in
the
afternoon
toward
morning
he
fell
asleep
through
sheer
weariness
and
when
he
awoke
late
in
the
day
his
first
glance
was
toward
the
road
he
saw
it
filled
with
men
and
horses
dragging
some
rolling
objects
but
these
men
were
carrying
guns
and
were
formed
in
battalions
and
regiments
the
animals
were
pulling
the
pieces
of
artillery
it
was
an
army
it
was
the
retreat
desnoyers
ran
to
the
edge
of
the
road
to
be
more
convinced
of
the
truth
alas
they
were
regiments
such
as
he
had
seen
leaving
the
stations
of
paris
but
with
what
a
very
different
aspect
the
blue
cloaks
were
now
ragged
and
yellowing
garments
the
trousers
faded
to
the
color
of
a
brick
the
shoes
great
cakes
of
mud
the
faces
had
a
desperate
expression
with
layers
of
dust
and
sweat
in
all
their
grooves
and
openings
with
beards
of
recent
growth
sharp
as
spikes
with
an
air
of
great
weariness
showing
the
longing
to
drop
down
somewhere
forever
killing
or
dying
but
without
going
a
step
further
they
were
tramping
tramping
tramping
some
marches
had
lasted
thirty
hours
at
a
stretch
the
enemy
was
on
their
tracks
and
the
order
was
to
go
on
and
not
to
fight
freeing
themselves
by
their
from
the
involved
movements
of
the
invader
the
chiefs
suspected
the
discouraged
exhaustion
of
their
men
they
might
exact
of
them
complete
sacrifice
of
life
but
to
order
them
to
march
day
and
night
forever
fleeing
before
the
enemy
when
they
did
not
consider
themselves
vanquished
when
they
were
animated
by
that
ferocious
wrath
which
is
the
mother
of
heroism
their
despairing
expressions
mutely
sought
the
nearest
officers
the
leaders
even
the
colonel
they
simply
could
go
no
further
such
a
long
devastating
march
in
such
a
few
days
and
what
for
the
superior
officers
who
knew
no
more
than
their
men
seemed
to
be
replying
with
their
eyes
as
though
they
possessed
a
secret
courage
one
more
effort
this
is
going
to
come
to
an
end
very
the
vigorous
beasts
having
no
imagination
were
resisting
less
than
the
men
but
their
aspect
was
deplorable
how
could
these
be
the
same
strong
horses
with
glossy
coats
that
he
had
seen
in
the
paris
processions
at
the
beginning
of
the
previous
month
a
campaign
of
twenty
days
had
aged
and
exhausted
them
their
dull
gaze
seemed
to
be
imploring
pity
they
were
weak
and
emaciated
the
outline
of
their
skeletons
so
plainly
apparent
that
it
made
their
eyes
look
larger
their
harness
as
they
moved
showed
the
skin
raw
and
bleeding
yet
they
were
pushing
on
with
a
mighty
effort
concentrating
their
last
powers
as
though
human
demands
were
beyond
their
obscure
instincts
some
could
go
no
further
and
suddenly
collapsed
from
sheer
fatigue
desnoyers
noticed
that
the
artillerymen
rapidly
unharnessed
them
pushing
them
out
of
the
road
so
as
to
leave
the
way
open
for
the
rest
there
lay
the
frames
with
stiffened
legs
and
glassy
eyes
staring
fixedly
at
the
first
flies
already
attracted
by
their
miserable
carrion
the
cannons
painted
gray
the
the
artillery
equipment
all
that
don
marcelo
had
seen
clean
and
shining
with
the
enthusiastic
friction
that
man
has
given
to
arms
from
remote
epochs
even
more
persistent
than
that
which
woman
gives
to
household
utensils
were
now
dirty
overlaid
with
the
marks
of
endless
use
with
the
wreckage
of
unavoidable
neglect
the
wheels
were
deformed
with
mud
the
metal
darkened
by
the
smoke
of
explosion
the
gray
paint
spotted
with
mossy
dampness
in
the
free
spaces
in
this
file
in
the
parentheses
opened
between
battery
and
regiment
were
sandwiched
crowds
of
civilians
miserable
groups
driven
on
by
the
invasion
populations
of
entire
towns
that
had
disintegrated
following
the
army
in
its
retreat
the
approach
of
a
new
division
would
make
them
leave
the
road
temporarily
continuing
their
march
in
the
adjoining
fields
then
at
the
slightest
opening
in
the
troops
they
would
again
slip
along
the
white
and
even
surface
of
the
highway
they
were
mothers
who
were
pushing
heaped
high
with
pyramids
of
furniture
and
tiny
babies
the
sick
who
could
hardly
drag
themselves
along
old
men
carried
on
the
shoulders
of
their
grandsons
old
women
with
little
children
clinging
to
their
skirts
a
pitiful
silent
brood
nobody
now
opposed
the
liberality
of
the
owner
of
the
castle
his
entire
vintage
seemed
to
be
overflowing
on
the
highway
casks
from
the
last
were
rolled
out
to
the
roadside
and
the
soldiers
filled
the
metal
ladles
hanging
from
their
belts
with
the
red
stream
then
the
bottled
wine
began
making
its
appearance
by
order
of
date
and
was
instantly
lost
in
the
river
of
men
continually
flowing
by
desnoyers
observed
with
much
satisfaction
the
effects
of
his
munificence
the
smiles
were
reappearing
on
the
despairing
faces
the
french
jest
was
leaping
from
row
to
row
and
on
resuming
their
march
the
groups
began
to
sing
then
he
went
to
see
the
officers
who
in
the
village
square
were
giving
their
horses
a
brief
rest
before
rejoining
their
columns
with
perplexed
countenances
and
heavy
eyes
they
were
talking
among
themselves
about
this
retreat
so
incomprehensible
to
them
all
days
before
in
guise
they
had
routed
their
pursuers
and
yet
now
they
were
continually
withdrawing
in
obedience
to
a
severe
and
endless
order
we
do
not
understand
it
they
were
saying
we
do
not
an
ordered
and
methodical
tide
was
dragging
back
these
men
who
wanted
to
fight
yet
had
to
retreat
all
were
suffering
the
same
cruel
doubt
we
do
not
and
doubt
was
making
still
more
distressing
this
march
with
only
the
briefest
rests
because
the
heads
of
the
divisions
were
in
hourly
fear
of
being
cut
off
from
the
rest
of
the
army
one
effort
more
boys
courage
soon
we
shall
rest
the
columns
in
their
retirement
were
extending
hundreds
of
miles
desnoyers
was
seeing
only
one
division
others
and
still
others
were
doing
exactly
this
same
thing
at
that
very
hour
their
recessional
extending
across
half
of
france
all
with
the
same
disheartened
obedience
were
falling
back
the
men
exclaiming
the
same
as
the
officials
we
don
t
understand
we
don
t
understand
don
marcelo
soon
felt
the
same
sadness
and
bewilderment
as
these
soldiers
he
didn
t
understand
either
he
saw
the
obvious
thing
what
all
were
able
to
see
the
territory
invaded
without
the
germans
encountering
any
stubborn
resistance
entire
counties
cities
villages
hamlets
remaining
in
the
power
of
the
enemy
at
the
back
of
an
army
that
was
constantly
withdrawing
his
enthusiasm
suddenly
collapsed
like
a
pricked
balloon
and
all
his
former
pessimism
returned
the
troops
were
displaying
energy
and
discipline
but
what
did
that
amount
to
if
they
had
to
keep
retreating
all
the
time
unable
on
account
of
strict
orders
to
fight
or
defend
the
land
just
as
it
was
in
the
s
he
sighed
outwardly
there
is
more
order
but
the
result
is
going
to
be
the
as
though
a
negative
reply
to
his
he
overheard
the
voice
of
a
soldier
reassuring
a
farmer
we
are
retreating
yes
only
that
we
may
pounce
upon
the
boches
with
more
strength
grandpa
joffre
is
going
to
put
them
in
his
pocket
when
and
where
he
the
mere
sound
of
the
marshal
s
name
revived
don
marcelo
s
hope
perhaps
this
soldier
who
was
keeping
his
faith
intact
in
spite
of
the
interminable
and
demoralizing
marches
was
nearer
the
truth
than
the
reasoning
and
studious
officers
he
passed
the
rest
of
the
day
making
presents
to
the
last
detachments
of
the
column
his
wine
cellars
were
gradually
emptying
by
order
of
dates
he
continued
distributing
thousands
of
bottles
stored
in
the
subterranean
parts
of
the
castle
by
evening
he
was
giving
to
those
who
appeared
weakest
bottles
covered
with
the
dust
of
many
years
as
the
lines
filed
by
the
men
seemed
weaker
and
more
exhausted
stragglers
were
now
passing
painfully
drawing
their
raw
and
bleeding
feet
from
their
shoes
some
had
already
freed
themselves
from
these
torture
cases
and
were
marching
barefoot
with
their
heavy
boots
hanging
from
their
shoulders
and
staining
the
highway
with
drops
of
blood
although
staggering
with
deadly
fatigue
they
kept
their
arms
and
outfits
believing
that
the
enemy
was
near
desnoyers
liberality
stupefied
many
of
them
they
were
accustomed
to
crossing
their
native
soil
having
to
struggle
with
the
selfishness
of
the
producer
nobody
had
been
offering
anything
fear
of
danger
had
made
the
country
folk
hide
their
eatables
and
refuse
to
lend
the
slightest
aid
to
their
compatriots
who
were
fighting
for
them
the
millionaire
slept
badly
this
second
night
in
his
pompous
bed
with
columns
and
plushes
that
had
belonged
to
henry
iv
according
to
the
declarations
of
the
salesmen
the
troops
no
longer
were
marching
past
from
time
to
time
there
straggled
by
a
single
battalion
a
battery
a
group
of
horsemen
the
last
forces
of
the
rear
guard
that
had
taken
their
position
on
the
outskirts
of
the
village
in
order
to
cover
the
retreat
the
profound
silence
that
followed
the
turmoil
of
transportation
awoke
in
his
mind
a
sense
of
doubt
and
disquietude
what
was
he
doing
there
when
the
soldiers
had
gone
was
he
not
crazy
to
remain
there
but
immediately
there
came
galloping
into
his
mind
the
great
riches
which
the
castle
contained
if
he
could
only
take
it
all
away
that
was
impossible
now
through
want
of
means
and
time
besides
his
stubborn
will
looked
upon
such
flight
as
a
shameful
concession
we
must
finish
what
we
have
begun
he
said
to
himself
he
had
made
the
trip
on
purpose
to
guard
his
own
and
he
must
not
flee
at
the
approach
of
danger
the
following
morning
when
he
went
down
into
the
village
he
saw
hardly
any
soldiers
only
a
single
detachment
of
dragoons
was
still
in
the
neighborhood
the
horsemen
were
scouring
the
woods
and
pushing
forward
the
stragglers
at
the
same
time
that
they
were
opposing
the
advance
of
the
enemy
the
troopers
had
obstructed
the
street
with
a
barricade
of
carts
and
furniture
standing
behind
this
crude
barrier
they
were
watching
the
white
strip
of
roadway
which
ran
between
the
two
hills
covered
with
trees
occasionally
there
sounded
stray
shots
like
the
snapping
of
cords
ours
said
the
troopers
these
were
the
last
detachments
of
sharpshooters
firing
at
the
advancing
uhlans
the
cavalry
of
the
rear
guard
had
the
task
of
opposing
a
continual
resistance
to
the
enemy
repelling
the
squads
of
germans
who
were
trying
to
work
their
way
along
to
the
retreating
columns
desnoyers
saw
approaching
along
the
highroad
the
last
stragglers
from
the
infantry
they
were
not
walking
they
rather
appeared
to
be
dragging
themselves
forward
with
the
firm
intention
of
advancing
but
were
betrayed
by
emaciated
legs
and
bleeding
feet
some
had
sunk
down
for
a
moment
by
the
roadside
agonized
with
weariness
in
order
to
breathe
without
the
weight
of
their
knapsacks
and
draw
their
swollen
feet
from
their
leather
prisons
and
wipe
off
the
sweat
but
upon
trying
to
renew
their
march
they
found
it
impossible
to
rise
their
bodies
seemed
made
of
stone
fatigue
had
brought
them
to
a
condition
bordering
on
catalepsy
so
unable
to
move
they
were
seeing
dimly
the
rest
of
the
army
passing
on
as
a
fantastic
file
battalions
more
battalions
batteries
troops
of
horses
then
the
silence
the
night
the
sleep
on
the
stones
and
dust
shaken
by
most
terrible
nightmare
at
daybreak
they
were
awakened
by
bodies
of
horsemen
exploring
the
ground
rounding
up
the
remnants
of
the
retreat
ay
it
was
impossible
to
move
the
dragoons
revolver
in
hand
had
to
resort
to
threats
in
order
to
rouse
them
only
the
certainty
that
the
pursuer
was
near
and
might
make
them
prisoners
gave
them
a
momentary
vigor
so
they
were
forcing
themselves
up
by
superhuman
effort
staggering
dragging
their
legs
and
supporting
themselves
on
their
guns
as
though
they
were
canes
many
of
these
were
young
men
who
had
aged
in
an
hour
and
changed
into
confirmed
invalids
poor
fellows
they
would
not
go
very
far
their
intention
was
to
follow
on
to
join
the
column
but
on
entering
the
village
they
looked
at
the
houses
with
supplicating
eyes
desiring
to
enter
them
feeling
such
a
craving
for
immediate
relief
that
they
forgot
even
the
nearness
of
the
enemy
villeblanche
was
now
more
military
than
before
the
arrival
of
the
troops
the
night
before
a
great
part
of
the
inhabitants
had
fled
having
become
infected
with
the
same
fear
that
was
driving
on
the
crowds
following
the
army
the
mayor
and
the
priest
remained
reconciled
with
the
owner
of
the
castle
through
his
unexpected
presence
in
their
midst
and
admiring
his
liberality
the
municipal
official
approached
to
give
him
some
news
the
engineers
were
mining
the
bridge
over
the
marne
they
were
only
waiting
for
the
dragoons
to
cross
before
blowing
it
up
if
he
wished
to
go
there
was
still
time
again
desnoyers
hesitated
certainly
it
was
foolhardy
to
remain
there
but
a
glance
at
the
woods
over
whose
branches
rose
the
towers
of
his
castle
settled
his
doubts
no
no
we
must
finish
what
we
have
begun
the
very
last
band
of
troopers
now
made
their
appearance
coming
out
of
the
woods
by
different
paths
they
were
riding
their
horses
slowly
as
though
they
deplored
this
retreat
they
kept
looking
behind
carbine
in
hand
ready
to
halt
and
shoot
the
others
who
had
been
occupying
the
barricade
were
already
on
their
mounts
the
division
reformed
the
commands
of
the
officers
were
heard
and
a
quick
trot
accompanied
by
the
clanking
of
metal
told
don
marcelo
that
the
last
of
the
army
had
left
he
remained
near
the
barricade
in
a
solitude
of
intense
silence
as
though
the
world
were
suddenly
depopulated
two
dogs
abandoned
by
the
flight
of
their
masters
leaped
and
sniffed
around
him
coaxing
him
for
protection
they
were
unable
to
get
the
desired
scent
in
that
land
trodden
down
and
disfigured
by
the
transit
of
thousands
of
men
a
family
cat
was
watching
the
birds
that
were
beginning
to
return
to
their
haunts
with
timid
flutterings
they
were
picking
at
what
the
horses
had
left
and
an
ownerless
hen
was
disputing
the
banquet
with
the
winged
band
until
then
hidden
in
the
trees
and
roofs
the
silence
intensified
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
the
hum
of
the
insects
the
summer
respiration
of
the
sunburnt
soil
which
appeared
to
have
contracted
timorously
under
the
weight
of
the
men
in
arms
desnoyers
was
losing
exact
track
of
the
passing
of
time
he
was
beginning
to
believe
that
all
which
had
gone
before
must
have
been
a
bad
dream
the
calm
surrounding
him
made
what
had
been
happening
here
seem
most
improbable
suddenly
he
saw
something
moving
at
the
far
end
of
the
road
at
the
very
highest
point
where
the
white
ribbon
of
the
highway
touched
the
blue
of
the
horizon
there
were
two
men
on
horseback
two
little
tin
soldiers
who
appeared
to
have
escaped
from
a
box
of
toys
he
had
brought
with
him
a
pair
of
field
glasses
that
had
often
surprised
marauders
on
his
property
and
by
their
aid
he
saw
more
clearly
the
two
riders
clad
in
greenish
gray
they
were
carrying
lances
and
wearing
helmets
ending
in
a
horizontal
plate
they
he
could
not
doubt
it
before
his
eyes
were
the
first
uhlans
for
some
time
they
remained
motionless
as
though
exploring
the
horizon
then
from
the
obscure
masses
of
vegetation
that
bordered
the
roadside
others
and
still
others
came
sallying
forth
in
groups
the
little
tin
soldiers
no
longer
were
showing
their
silhouettes
against
the
horizon
s
blue
the
whiteness
of
the
highway
was
now
making
their
background
ascending
behind
their
heads
they
came
slowly
down
like
a
band
that
fears
ambush
examining
carefully
everything
around
the
advisability
of
prompt
retirement
made
don
marcelo
bring
his
investigations
to
a
close
it
would
be
most
disastrous
for
him
if
they
surprised
him
here
but
on
lowering
his
glasses
something
extraordinary
passed
across
his
field
of
vision
a
short
distance
away
so
that
he
could
almost
touch
them
with
his
hand
he
saw
many
men
skulking
along
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
on
both
sides
of
the
road
his
surprise
increased
as
he
became
convinced
that
they
were
frenchmen
wearing
kepis
where
were
they
coming
from
he
examined
more
closely
with
his
spy
glass
they
were
stragglers
in
a
lamentable
state
of
body
and
a
picturesque
variety
of
uniforms
infantry
zouaves
dragoons
without
their
horses
and
with
them
were
forest
guards
and
officers
from
the
villages
that
had
received
too
late
the
news
of
the
retreat
altogether
about
fifty
a
few
were
fresh
and
vigorous
others
were
keeping
themselves
up
by
supernatural
effort
all
were
carrying
arms
they
finally
made
the
barricade
looking
continually
behind
them
in
order
to
watch
in
the
shelter
of
the
trees
the
slow
advance
of
the
uhlans
at
the
head
of
this
heterogeneous
troop
was
an
official
of
the
police
old
and
fat
with
a
revolver
in
his
right
hand
his
moustache
bristling
with
excitement
and
a
murderous
glitter
in
his
blue
eyes
the
band
was
continuing
its
advance
through
the
village
slipping
over
to
the
other
side
of
the
barricade
of
carts
without
paying
much
attention
to
their
curious
countryman
when
suddenly
sounded
a
loud
detonation
making
the
horizon
vibrate
and
the
houses
tremble
what
is
that
asked
the
officer
looking
at
desnoyers
for
the
first
time
he
explained
that
it
was
the
bridge
which
had
just
been
blown
up
the
leader
received
the
news
with
an
oath
but
his
confused
followers
brought
together
by
chance
remained
as
indifferent
as
though
they
had
lost
all
contact
with
reality
might
as
well
die
here
as
anywhere
continued
the
official
many
of
the
fugitives
acknowledged
this
decision
with
prompt
obedience
since
it
saved
them
the
torture
of
continuing
their
march
they
were
almost
rejoicing
at
the
explosion
which
had
cut
off
their
progress
instinctively
they
were
gathering
in
the
places
most
sheltered
by
the
barricade
some
entered
the
abandoned
houses
whose
doors
the
dragoons
had
forced
in
order
to
utilize
the
upper
floors
all
seemed
satisfied
to
be
able
to
rest
even
though
they
might
soon
have
to
fight
the
officer
went
from
group
to
group
giving
his
orders
they
must
not
fire
till
he
gave
the
word
don
marcelo
watched
these
preparations
with
the
immovability
of
surprise
so
rapid
and
noiseless
had
been
the
apparition
of
the
stragglers
that
he
imagined
he
must
still
be
dreaming
there
could
be
no
danger
in
this
unreal
situation
it
was
all
a
lie
and
he
remained
in
his
place
without
understanding
the
deputy
who
was
ordering
his
departure
with
roughest
words
obstinate
civilian
the
reverberation
of
the
explosion
had
filled
the
highway
with
horsemen
they
were
coming
from
all
directions
forming
themselves
into
the
advance
group
the
uhlans
were
galloping
around
under
the
impression
that
the
village
was
abandoned
fire
desnoyers
was
enveloped
in
a
rain
of
crackling
noises
as
though
the
trunks
of
all
the
trees
had
split
before
his
eyes
the
impetuous
band
halted
suddenly
some
of
their
men
were
rolling
on
the
ground
some
were
bending
themselves
double
trying
to
get
across
the
road
without
being
seen
others
remained
stretched
out
on
their
backs
or
face
downward
with
their
arms
in
front
the
riderless
horses
were
racing
wildly
across
the
fields
with
reins
dragging
urged
on
by
the
loose
stirrups
and
after
this
rude
shock
which
had
brought
them
surprise
and
death
the
band
disappeared
instantly
swallowed
up
by
the
trees
chapter
iv
near
the
sacred
grotto
argensola
had
found
a
new
occupation
even
more
exciting
than
marking
out
on
the
map
the
manoeuvres
of
the
armies
i
am
now
devoting
myself
to
the
taube
he
announced
it
appears
from
four
to
five
with
the
precision
a
punctilious
guest
coming
to
take
every
afternoon
at
the
appointed
hour
a
german
aeroplane
was
flying
over
paris
dropping
bombs
this
intimidation
was
producing
no
terror
the
people
accepting
the
visit
as
an
interesting
and
extraordinary
spectacle
in
vain
the
aviators
were
flinging
in
the
city
streets
german
flags
bearing
ironic
messages
giving
accounts
of
the
defeat
of
the
retreating
army
and
the
failures
of
the
russian
offensive
lies
all
lies
in
vain
they
were
dropping
bombs
destroying
garrets
killing
or
wounding
old
men
women
and
babes
ah
the
bandits
the
crowds
would
threaten
with
their
fists
the
malign
mosquito
scarcely
visible
feet
above
them
and
after
this
outburst
they
would
follow
it
with
straining
eyes
from
street
to
street
or
stand
motionless
in
the
square
in
order
to
study
its
evolutions
the
most
punctual
of
all
the
spectators
was
argensola
at
four
o
clock
he
was
in
the
place
de
la
concorde
with
upturned
face
and
eyes
in
most
cordial
with
all
the
bystanders
it
was
as
though
they
were
holding
season
tickets
at
the
same
theatre
becoming
acquainted
through
seeing
each
other
so
often
will
it
come
will
it
not
come
the
women
appeared
to
be
the
most
vehement
some
of
them
rushing
up
flushed
and
breathless
fearing
that
they
might
have
arrived
too
late
for
the
show
a
great
cry
there
it
comes
there
it
is
and
thousands
of
hands
were
pointing
to
a
vague
spot
on
the
horizon
with
field
glasses
and
telescopes
they
were
aiding
their
vision
the
popular
venders
offering
every
kind
of
optical
instruments
and
for
an
hour
the
thrilling
spectacle
of
an
aerial
hunt
was
played
out
noisy
and
useless
the
great
insect
was
trying
to
reach
the
eiffel
tower
and
from
its
base
would
come
sharp
reports
at
the
same
time
that
the
different
platforms
spit
out
a
fierce
stream
of
shrapnel
as
it
zigzagged
over
the
city
the
discharge
of
rifles
would
crackle
from
roof
and
street
everyone
that
had
arms
in
his
house
was
firing
the
soldiers
of
the
guard
and
the
english
and
belgians
on
their
way
through
paris
they
knew
that
their
shots
were
perfectly
useless
but
they
were
firing
for
the
fun
of
retorting
hoping
at
the
same
time
that
one
of
their
chance
shots
might
achieve
a
miracle
but
the
only
miracle
was
that
the
shooters
did
not
kill
each
other
with
their
precipitate
and
ineffectual
fire
as
it
was
a
few
did
fall
wounded
by
balls
from
unknown
sources
argensola
would
tear
from
street
to
street
following
the
evolutions
of
the
inimical
bird
trying
to
guess
where
its
projectiles
would
fall
anxious
to
be
the
first
to
reach
the
bombarded
house
excited
by
the
shots
that
were
answering
from
below
and
to
think
that
he
had
no
gun
like
those
englishmen
or
those
belgians
in
barrick
cap
with
tassel
over
the
front
finally
the
taube
tired
of
manoeuvering
would
disappear
until
ejaculated
the
spaniard
perhaps
s
show
may
be
even
more
interesting
he
employed
his
free
hours
between
his
geographical
observations
and
his
aerial
contemplations
in
making
the
rounds
of
the
stations
watching
the
crowds
of
travellers
making
their
escape
from
paris
the
sudden
vision
of
the
truth
after
the
illusion
which
the
government
had
been
creating
with
its
optimistic
dispatches
the
certainty
that
the
germans
were
actually
near
when
a
week
before
they
had
imagined
them
completely
routed
the
taubes
flying
over
paris
the
mysterious
threat
of
the
zeppelins
all
these
dangerous
signs
were
filling
a
part
of
the
community
with
frenzied
desperation
the
railroad
stations
guarded
by
the
soldiery
were
only
admitting
those
who
had
secured
tickets
in
advance
some
had
been
waiting
entire
days
for
their
turn
to
depart
the
most
impatient
were
starting
to
walk
eager
to
get
outside
of
the
city
as
soon
as
possible
the
roads
were
black
with
the
crowds
all
going
in
the
same
directions
toward
the
south
they
were
fleeing
by
automobile
in
carriages
in
gardeners
carts
on
foot
argensola
surveyed
this
hegira
with
serenity
he
would
remain
because
he
had
always
admired
those
men
who
witnessed
the
siege
of
paris
in
now
it
was
going
to
be
his
good
fortune
to
observe
an
historical
drama
perhaps
even
more
interesting
the
wonders
that
he
would
be
able
to
relate
in
the
future
but
the
distraction
and
indifference
of
his
present
audience
were
annoying
him
greatly
he
would
hasten
back
to
the
studio
in
feverish
excitement
to
communicate
the
latest
gratifying
news
to
desnoyers
who
would
listen
as
though
he
did
not
hear
him
the
night
that
he
informed
him
that
the
government
the
chambers
the
diplomatic
corps
and
even
the
actors
of
the
comedie
francaise
were
going
that
very
hour
on
special
trains
for
bordeaux
his
companion
merely
replied
with
a
shrug
of
indifference
desnoyers
was
worrying
about
other
things
that
morning
he
had
received
a
note
from
marguerite
only
two
lines
scrawled
in
great
haste
she
was
leaving
starting
immediately
accompanied
by
her
mother
adieu
and
nothing
more
the
panic
had
caused
many
to
be
forgotten
had
broken
off
long
intimacies
but
marguerite
s
temperament
was
above
such
incoherencies
from
mere
flight
julio
felt
that
her
terseness
was
very
ominous
why
not
mention
the
place
to
which
she
was
going
in
the
afternoon
he
took
a
bold
step
which
she
had
always
forbidden
he
went
to
her
home
and
talked
a
long
time
with
the
concierge
in
order
to
get
some
news
the
good
woman
was
delighted
to
work
off
on
him
the
loquacity
so
brusquely
cut
short
by
the
flight
of
tenants
and
servants
the
lady
on
the
first
floor
marguerite
s
mother
had
been
the
last
to
abandon
the
house
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
she
was
really
sick
over
her
son
s
departure
they
had
left
the
day
before
without
saying
where
they
were
going
the
only
thing
that
she
knew
was
that
they
took
the
train
in
the
gare
d
orsay
they
were
going
toward
the
south
like
all
the
rest
of
the
rich
and
she
supplemented
her
revelations
with
the
vague
news
that
the
daughter
had
seemed
very
much
upset
by
the
information
that
she
had
received
from
the
front
someone
in
the
family
was
wounded
perhaps
it
was
the
brother
but
she
really
didn
t
know
with
so
many
surprises
and
strange
things
happening
it
was
difficult
to
keep
track
of
everything
her
husband
too
was
in
the
army
and
she
had
her
own
affairs
to
worry
about
where
can
she
have
gone
julio
asked
himself
all
day
long
why
does
she
wish
to
keep
me
in
ignorance
of
her
whereabouts
when
his
comrade
told
him
that
night
about
the
transfer
of
the
seat
of
government
with
all
the
mystery
of
news
not
yet
made
public
desnoyers
merely
replied
they
are
doing
the
best
thing
i
too
will
go
tomorrow
if
i
why
remain
longer
in
paris
his
family
was
away
his
father
according
to
argensola
s
investigations
also
had
gone
off
without
saying
whither
now
marguerite
s
mysterious
flight
was
leaving
him
entirely
alone
in
a
solitude
that
was
filling
him
with
remorse
that
afternoon
when
strolling
through
the
boulevards
he
had
stumbled
across
a
friend
considerably
older
than
himself
an
acquaintance
in
the
fencing
club
which
he
used
to
frequent
this
was
the
first
time
they
had
met
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
they
ran
over
the

inquiries
were
answered
by
the
older
man
he
had
been
wounded
in
lorraine
and
was
now
in
a
hospital
in
the
south
another
friend
dead
in
the
vosges
another
disappeared
at

and
thus
had
continued

heroic
and

living
doing
brave
things
the
members
of
foreign
birth
young
poles
english
residents
in
paris
and
south

had
finally
enlisted
as
volunteers
the

might
well
be
proud
of
its
young
men
who
had
practised
arms
in
times
of
peace
for
now
they
were
all

their
existence
at
the
front
desnoyers
turned
his
face
away
as
though
he
feared
to
meet
in
the
eyes
of
his
friend
an
ironical
and
questioning
expression
why
had
he
not
gone
with
the
others
to
defend
the
land
in
which
he
was
living
i
will
go
repeated
julio
depressed
by
this
recollection
but
he
went
toward
the
south
like
all
those
who
were
fleeing
from
the
war
the
following
morning
argensola
was
charged
to
get
him
a
railroad
ticket
for
bordeaux
the
value
of
money
had
greatly
increased
but
fifty
francs
opportunely
bestowed
wrought
the
miracle
and
procured
a
bit
of
numbered
cardboard
whose
conquest
represented
many
days
of
waiting
it
is
good
only
for
said
the
spaniard
you
will
have
to
take
the
night
packing
was
not
a
very
serious
matter
as
the
trains
were
refusing
to
admit
anything
more
than
argensola
did
not
wish
to
accept
the
liberality
of
julio
who
tried
to
leave
all
his
money
with
him
heroes
need
very
little
and
the
painter
of
souls
was
inspired
with
heroic
resolution
the
brief
harangue
of
gallieni
in
taking
charge
of
the
defense
of
paris
he
had
adopted
as
his
own
he
intended
to
keep
up
his
courage
to
the
last
just
like
the
hardy
general
let
them
come
he
exclaimed
with
a
tragic
expression
they
will
find
me
at
my
post
his
post
was
the
studio
from
which
he
could
witness
the
happenings
which
he
proposed
relating
to
coming
generations
he
would
entrench
himself
there
with
the
eatables
and
wines
besides
he
had
the
plan
just
as
soon
as
his
partner
should
disappear
of
bringing
to
live
there
with
him
certain
who
were
wandering
around
in
search
of
a
problematical
dinner
and
feeling
timid
in
the
solitude
of
their
own
quarters
danger
often
gathers
congenial
folk
together
and
adds
a
new
attractiveness
to
the
pleasures
of
a
community
the
tender
affections
of
the
prisoners
of
the
terror
when
they
were
expecting
momentarily
to
be
conducted
to

guillotine
flashed
through

at

draught
since

the
studio
of
the
rue
de

was
about
to
witness
the
mad
and
desperate
revels
of
a
castaway
bark
with
provisions
desnoyers
left
the
gare
d
orsay
in
a
compartment
mentally
praising
the
good
order
with
which
the
authorities
had
arranged
everything
so
that
every
traveller
could
have
his
own
seat
at
the
austerlitz
station
however
a
human
avalanche
assaulted
the
train
the
doors
were
broken
open
packages
and
children
came
in
through
the
windows
like
projectiles
the
people
pushed
with
the
unreason
of
a
crowd
fleeing
before
a
fire
in
the
space
reserved
for
eight
persons
fourteen
installed
themselves
the
passageways
were
heaped
with
mountains
of
bags
and
valises
that
served
later
travellers
for
seats
all
class
distinctions
had
disappeared
the
villagers
invaded
by
preference
the
best
coaches
believing
that
they
would
there
find
more
room
those
holding
tickets
hunted
up
the
plainer
coaches
in
the
vain
hope
of
travelling
without
being
crowded
on
the
cross
roads
were
waiting
from
the
day
before
long
trains
made
up
of
cattle
cars
all
the
stables
on
wheels
were
filled
with
people
seated
on
the
wooden
floor
or
in
chairs
brought
from
their
homes
every
train
load
was
an
encampment
eager
to
take
up
its
march
whenever
it
halted
layers
of
greasy
papers
hulls
and
fruit
skins
collected
along
its
entire
length
the
invaders
pushing
their
way
in
put
up
with
many
annoyances
and
pardoned
one
another
in
a
brotherly
way
in
war
times
war
measures
they
would
always
say
as
a
last
excuse
and
each
one
was
pressing
closer
to
his
neighbor
in
order
to
make
a
few
more
inches
of
room
and
helping
to
wedge
his
scanty
baggage
among
the
other
bundles
swaying
most
precariously
above
little
by
little
desnoyers
was
losing
all
his
advantage
as
a
first
comer
these
poor
people
who
had
been
waiting
for
the
train
from
four
in
the
morning
till
eight
at
night
awakened
his
pity
the
women
groaning
with
weariness
were
standing
in
the
corridors
looking
with
ferocious
envy
at
those
who
had
seats
the
children
were
bleating
like
hungry
kids
julio
finally
gave
up
his
place
sharing
with
the
needy
and
improvident
the
bountiful
supply
of
eatables
with
which
argensola
had
provided
him
the
station
restaurants
had
all
been
emptied
of
food
during
the
train
s
long
wait
soldiers
only
were
seen
on
the
platform
soldiers
who
were
hastening
at
the
call
of
the
trumpet
to
take
their
places
again
in
the
strings
of
cars
which
were
constantly
steaming
toward
paris
at
the
signal
stations
long
war
trains
were
waiting
for
the
road
to
be
clear
that
they
might
continue
their
journey
the
cuirassiers
wearing
a
yellow
vest
over
their
steel
breastplate
were
seated
with
hanging
legs
in
the
doorways
of
the
stable
cars
from
whose
interior
came
repeated
neighing
upon
the
flat
cars
were
rows
of
gun
carriages
the
slender
throats
of
the
cannon
of
were
pointed
upwards
like
telescopes
young
desnoyers
passed
the
night
in
the
aisle
seated
on
a
valise
noting
the
sodden
sleep
of
those
around
him
worn
out
by
weariness
and
exhaustion
it
was
a
cruel
and
endless
night
of
jerks
shrieks
and
stops
punctuated
by
snores
at
every
station
the
trumpets
were
sounding
precipitously
as
though
the
enemy
were
right
upon
them
the
soldiers
from
the
south
were
hurrying
to
their
posts
and
at
brief
intervals
another
detachment
of
men
was
dragged
along
the
rails
toward
paris
they
all
appeared
gay
and
anxious
to
reach
the
scene
of
slaughter
as
soon
as
possible
many
were
regretting
the
delays
fearing
that
they
might
arrive
too
late
leaning
out
of
the
window
julio
heard
the
dialogues
and
shouts
on
the
platforms
impregnated
with
the
acrid
odor
of
men
and
mules
all
were
evincing
an
unquenchable
confidence
the
boches
very
numerous
with
huge
cannons
with
many
mitrailleuse
but
we
only
have
to
charge
with
our
bayonets
to
make
them
run
like
rabbits
the
attitude
of
those
going
to
meet
death
was
in
sharp
contrast
to
the
panic
and
doubt
of
those
who
were
deserting
paris
an
old
and
gentleman
type
of
a
jubilee
functionary
kept
questioning
desnoyers
whenever
the
train
started
on
again
do
you
believe
that
they
will
get
as
far
as
tours
before
receiving
his
reply
he
would
fall
asleep
brutish
sleep
was
marching
down
the
aisles
with
leaden
feet
at
every
junction
the
old
man
would
start
up
and
suddenly
ask
do
you
believe
that
we
will
get
as
far
as
bordeaux
and
his
great
desire
not
to
halt
until
with
his
family
he
had
reached
an
absolutely
secure
refuge
made
him
accept
as
oracles
all
the
vague
responses
at
daybreak
they
saw
the
territorialists
guarding
the
roads
they
were
armed
with
old
muskets
and
were
wearing
the
red
kepis
as
their
only
military
distinction
they
were
following
the
opposite
course
of
the
military
trains
in
the
station
at
bordeaux
the
civilian
crowds
struggling
to
get
out
or
to
enter
other
cars
were
mingling
with
the
troops
the
trumpets
were
incessantly
sounding
their
brazen
notes
calling
the
soldiers
together
many
were
men
of
darkest
coloring
natives
with
wide
gray
breeches
and
red
caps
above
their
black
or
bronzed
faces
julio
saw
a
train
bearing
wounded
from
the
battles
of
flanders
and
lorraine
their
worn
and
dirty
uniforms
were
enlivened
by
the
whiteness
of
the
bandages
sustaining
the
wounded
limbs
or
protecting
the
broken
heads
all
were
trying
to
smile
although
with
livid
mouths
and
feverish
eyes
at
their
first
glimpse
of
the
land
of
the
south
as
it
emerged
from
the
mist
bathed
in
the
sunlight
and
covered
with
the
regal
vestures
of
its
vineyards
the
men
from
the
north
stretched
out
their
hands
for
the
fruit
that
the
women
were
offering
them
tasting
with
delight
the
sweet
grapes
of
the
country
for
four
days
the
distracted
lover
lived
in
bordeaux
stunned
and
bewildered
by
the
agitation
of
a
provincial
city
suddenly
converted
into
a
capital
the
hotels
were
overcrowded
many
notables
contenting
themselves
with
servants
quarters
there
was
not
a
vacant
seat
in
the
cafes
the
sidewalks
could
not
accommodate
the
extraordinary
assemblage
the
president
was
installed
in
the
prefecture
the
state
departments
were
established
in
the
schools
and
museums
two
theatres
were
fitted
up
for
the
future
reunions
of
the
senate
and
the
chamber
of
deputies
julio
was
lodged
in
a
filthy
disreputable
hotel
at
the
end
of
a
alley
a
little
cupid
adorned
the
crystals
of
the
door
and
the
in
his
room
was
scratched
with
names
and
unspeakable
phrases
souvenirs
of
the
occupants
of
an
hour
and
yet
many
grand
ladies
hunting
in
vain
for
temporary
residence
would
have
envied
him
his
good
fortune
all
his
investigations
proved
fruitless
the
friends
whom
he
encountered
in
the
fugitive
crowd
were
thinking
only
of
their
own
affairs
they
could
talk
of
nothing
but
incidents
of
the
installation
repeating
the
news
gathered
from
the
ministers
with
whom
they
were
living
on
familiar
terms
or
mentioning
with
a
mysterious
air
the
great
battle
which
was
going
on
stretching
from
the
vicinity
of
paris
to
verdun
a
pupil
of
his
days
of
glory
whose
former
elegance
was
now
attired
in
the
uniform
of
a
nurse
gave
him
some
vague
information
the
little
madame
laurier
i
remember
hearing
that
she
was
living
somewhere
near
here
perhaps
in
julio
needed
no
more
than
this
to
continue
his
journey
to
biarritz
the
first
person
that
he
encountered
on
his
arrival
was
chichi
she
declared
that
the
town
was
impossible
because
of
the
families
of
rich
spaniards
who
were
summering
there
the
boches
are
in
the
majority
and
i
pass
a
miserable
existence
quarrelling
with
them
i
shall
finally
have
to
live
then
he
met
his
mother
embraces
and
tears
afterwards
he
saw
his
aunt
elena
in
the
hotel
parlors
most
enthusiastic
over
the
country
and
the
summer
colony
she
could
talk
at
great
length
with
many
of
them
about
the
decadence
of
france
they
were
all
expecting
to
receive
the
news
from
one
moment
to
another
that
the
kaiser
had
entered
the
capital
ponderous
men
who
had
never
done
anything
in
all
their
lives
were
criticizing
the
defects
and
indolence
of
the
republic
young
men
whose
aristocracy
aroused
dona
elena
s
enthusiasm
broke
forth
into
apostrophes
against
the
corruption
of
paris
corruption
that
they
had
studied
thoroughly
from
sunset
to
sunrise
in
the
virtuous
schools
of
montmartre
they
all
adored
germany
where
they
had
never
been
or
which
they
knew
only
through
the
reels
of
the
moving
picture
films
they
criticized
events
as
though
they
were
witnessing
a
bull
fight
the
germans
have
the
snap
you
can
t
fool
with
them
they
are
fine
brutes
and
they
appeared
to
admire
this
inhumanity
as
the
most
admirable
characteristic
why
will
they
not
say
that
in
their
own
home
on
the
other
side
of
the
frontier
chichi
would
protest
why
do
they
come
into
their
neighbor
s
country
to
ridicule
his
troubles
possibly
they
consider
it
a
sign
of
their
wonderful
but
julio
had
not
gone
to
biarritz
to
live
with
his
family
the
very
day
of
his
arrival
he
saw
marguerite
s
mother
in
the
distance
she
was
alone
his
inquiries
developed
the
information
that
her
daughter
was
living
in
pau
she
was
a
trained
nurse
taking
care
of
a
wounded
member
of
the
family
her
brother
undoubtedly
it
is
her
brother
thought
julio
and
he
again
continued
his
trip
this
time
going
to
pau
his
visits
to
the
hospitals
there
were
also
unavailing
nobody
seemed
to
know
marguerite
every
day
a
train
was
arriving
with
a
new
load
of
bleeding
flesh
but
her
brother
was
not
among
the
wounded
a
sister
of
charity
believing
that
he
was
in
search
of
someone
of
his
family
took
pity
on
him
and
gave
him
some
helpful
directions
he
ought
to
go
to
lourdes
there
were
many
of
the
wounded
there
and
many
of
the
military
nurses
so
desnoyers
immediately
took
the
short
cut
between
pau
and
lourdes
he
had
never
visited
the
sacred
city
whose
name
was
so
frequently
on
his
mother
s
lips
for
dona
luisa
the
french
nation
was
lourdes
in
her
discussions
with
her
sister
and
other
foreign
ladies
who
were
praying
that
france
might
be
exterminated
for
its
impiety
the
good
senora
always
summed
up
her
opinions
in
the
same
words
when
the
virgin
wished
to
make
her
appearance
in
our
day
she
chose
france
this
country
therefore
can
not
be
as
bad
as
you
say
when
i
see
that
she
appears
in
berlin
we
will
then
the
but
desnoyers
was
not
there
to
confirm
his
mother
s
artless
opinions
just
as
soon
as
he
had
found
a
room
in
a
hotel
near
the
river
he
had
hastened
to
the
big
hostelry
now
converted
into
a
hospital
the
guard
told
him
that
he
could
not
speak
to
the
director
until
the
afternoon
in
order
to
curb
his
impatience
he
walked
through
the
street
leading
to
the
basilica
past
all
the
booths
and
shops
with
pictures
and
pious
souvenirs
which
have
converted
the
place
into
a
big
bazaar
here
and
in
the
gardens
adjoining
the
church
he
saw
wounded
convalescents
with
uniforms
stained
with
traces
of
the
combat
their
cloaks
were
greatly
soiled
in
spite
of
repeated
brushings
the
mud
the
blood
and
the
rain
had
left
indelible
spots
and
made
them
as
stiff
as
cardboard
some
of
the
wounded
had
cut
their
sleeves
in
order
to
avoid
the
cruel
friction
on
their
shattered
arms
others
still
showed
on
their
trousers
the
rents
made
by
the
devastating
shells
they
were
fighters
of
all
ranks
and
of
many
races
infantry
cavalry
artillerymen
soldiers
from
the
metropolis
and
from
the
colonies
french
farmers
and
african
sharpshooters
red
heads
faces
of
mohammedan
olive
and
the
black
countenances
of
the
sengalese
with
eyes
of
fire
and
thick
bluish
blubber
lips
some
showing
the
and
sedentary
obesity
of
the
man
suddenly
converted
into
a
warrior
others
sinewy
alert
with
the
aggressive
profile
of
men
born
to
fight
and
experienced
in
foreign
fields
the
city
formerly
visited
by
the
hopeful
catholic
sick
was
now
invaded
by
a
crowd
no
less
dolorous
but
clad
in
carnival
colors
all
in
spite
of
their
physical
distress
had
a
certain
air
of
good
cheer
and
satisfaction
they
had
seen
death
very
near
slipping
out
from
his
bony
claws
into
a
new
joy
and
zest
in
life
with
their
cloaks
adorned
with
medals
their
theatrical
moorish
garments
their
kepis
and
their
african
headdresses
this
heroic
band
presented
nevertheless
a
lamentable
aspect
very
few
still
preserved
the
noble
vertical
carriage
the
pride
of
the
superior
human
being
they
were
walking
along
bent
almost
double
limping
dragging
themselves
forward
by
the
help
of
a
staff
or
friendly
arm
others
had
to
let
themselves
be
pushed
along
stretched
out
on
the
which
had
so
often
conducted
the
devout
sick
from
the
station
to
the
grotto
of
the
virgin
some
were
feeling
their
way
along
blindly
leaning
on
a
child
or
nurse
the
first
encounters
in
belgium
and
in
the
east
a
mere
battles
had
been
enough
to
produce
these
physical
wrecks
still
showing
a
manly
nobility
in
spite
of
the
most
horrible
outrages
these
organisms
struggling
so
tenaciously
to
regain
their
hold
on
life
bringing
their
reviving
energies
out
into
the
sunlight
represented
but
the
most
minute
part
of
the
number
mowed
down
by
the
scythe
of
death
back
of
them
were
thousands
and
thousands
of
comrades
groaning
on
hospital
beds
from
which
they
would
probably
never
rise
thousands
and
thousands
were
hidden
forever
in
the
bosom
of
the
earth
moistened
by
their
death
agony
fatal
land
which
upon
receiving
a
hail
of
projectiles
brought
forth
a
harvest
of
bristling
crosses
war
now
showed
itself
to
desnoyers
with
all
its
cruel
hideousness
he
had
been
accustomed
to
speak
of
it
heretofore
as
those
in
robust
health
speak
of
death
knowing
that
it
exists
and
is
horrible
but
seeing
it
afar
off
so
far
off
that
it
arouses
no
real
emotion
the
explosion
of
the
shells
were
accompanying
their
destructive
brutality
with
a
ferocious
mockery
grotesquely
disfiguring
the
human
body
he
saw
wounded
objects
just
beginning
to
recover
their
vital
force
who
were
but
rough
skeletons
of
men
frightful
caricatures
human
rags
saved
from
the
tomb
by
the
audacities
of
science
trunks
with
heads
which
were
dragged
along
on
wheeled
platforms
fragments
of
skulls
whose
brains
were
throbbing
under
an
artificial
cap
beings
without
arms
and
without
legs
resting
in
the
bottom
of
little
wagons
like
bits
of
plaster
models
or
scraps
from
the
dissecting
room
faces
without
noses
that
looked
like
skulls
with
great
black
nasal
openings
and
these
were
talking
smoking
laughing
satisfied
to
see
the
sky
to
feel
the
caress
of
the
sun
to
have
come
back
to
life
dominated
by
that
sovereign
desire
to
live
which
trustingly
forgets
present
misery
in
the
confident
hope
of
something
better
so
strongly
was
julio
impressed
that
for
a
little
while
he
forgot
the
purpose
which
had
brought
him
thither
if
those
who
provoke
war
from
diplomatic
chambers
or
from
the
tables
of
the
military
staff
could
but
see
it
not
in
the
field
of
battle
fired
with
the
enthusiasm
which
prejudices
judgments
but
in
cold
blood
as
it
is
seen
in
the
hospitals
and
cemeteries
in
the
wrecks
left
in
its
trail
to
julio
s
imagination
this
terrestrial
globe
appeared
like
an
enormous
ship
sailing
through
infinity
its
crews
poor
humanity
had
spent
century
after
century
in
exterminating
each
other
on
the
deck
they
did
not
even
know
what
existed
under
their
feet
in
the
hold
of
the
vessel
to
occupy
the
same
portion
of
the
surface
in
the
sunlight
seemed
to
be
the
ruling
desire
of
each
group
men
considered
superior
human
beings
were
pushing
these
masses
to
extermination
in
order
to
scale
the
last
bridge
and
hold
the
helm
controlling
the
course
of
the
boat
and
all
those
who
felt
the
overmastering
ambition
for
absolute
command
knew
the
same
thing
nothing
not
one
of
them
could
say
with
certainty
what
lay
beyond
the
visible
horizon
nor
whither
the
ship
was
drifting
the
sullen
hostility
of
mystery
surrounded
them
all
their
life
was
precarious
necessitating
incessant
care
in
order
to
maintain
it
yet
in
spite
of
that
the
crew
for
ages
and
ages
had
never
known
an
instant
of
agreement
of
team
work
of
clear
reason
periodically
half
of
them
would
clash
with
the
other
half
they
killed
each
other
that
they
might
enslave
the
vanquished
on
the
rolling
deck
floating
over
the
abyss
they
fought
that
they
might
cast
their
victims
from
the
vessel
filling
its
wake
with
cadavers
and
from
the
demented
throng
there
were
still
springing
up
gloomy
sophistries
to
prove
that
a
state
of
war
was
the
perfect
state
that
it
ought
to
go
on
forever
that
it
was
a
bad
dream
on
the
part
of
the
crew
to
wish
to
regard
each
other
as
brothers
with
a
common
destiny
enveloped
in
the
same
unsteady
environment
of
mystery
ah
human
misery
julio
was
drawn
out
of
these
pessimistic
reflections
by
the
childish
glee
which
many
of
the
convalescents
were
evincing
some
were
mussulmans
sharpshooters
from
algeria
and
morocco
in
lourdes
as
they
might
be
anywhere
they
were
interested
only
in
the
gifts
which
the
people
were
showering
upon
them
with
patriotic
affection
they
all
surveyed
with
indifference
the
basilica
inhabited
by
the
white
lady
their
only
preoccupation
being
to
beg
for
cigars
and
sweets
finding
themselves
regaled
by
the
dominant
race
they
became
greatly
puffed
up
daring
everything
like
mischievous
children
what
pleased
them
most
was
the
fact
that
the
ladies
would
take
them
by
the
hand
blessed
war
that
permitted
them
to
approach
and
touch
these
white
women
perfumed
and
smiling
as
they
appeared
in
their
dreams
of
the
paradise
of
the
blest
lady
lady
they
would
sigh
looking
at
them
with
dark
sparkling
eyes
and
not
content
with
the
hand
their
dark
paws
would
venture
the
length
of
the
entire
arm
while
the
ladies
laughed
at
this
tremulous
adoration
others
would
go
through
the
crowds
offering
their
right
hand
to
all
the
women
we
touch
and
then
they
would
go
away
satisfied
after
receiving
the
hand
clasp
desnoyers
wandered
a
long
time
around
the
basilica
where
in
the
shadow
of
the
trees
were
long
rows
of
wheeled
chairs
occupied
by
the
wounded
officers
and
soldiers
rested
many
hours
in
the
blue
shade
watching
their
comrades
who
were
able
to
use
their
legs
the
sacred
grotto
was
resplendent
with
the
lights
from
hundreds
of
candles
devout
crowds
were
kneeling
in
the
open
air
fixing
their
eyes
in
supplication
on
the
sacred
stones
whilst
their
thoughts
were
flying
far
away
to
the
fields
of
battle
making
their
petitions
with
that
confidence
in
divinity
which
accompanies
every
distress
among
the
kneeling
mass
were
many
soldiers
with
bandaged
heads
kepis
in
hand
and
tearful
eyes
up
and
down
the
double
staircase
of
the
basilica
were
flitting
women
clad
in
white
with
spotless
headdresses
that
fluttered
in
such
a
way
that
they
appeared
like
flying
doves
these
were
the
nurses
and
sisters
of
charity
guiding
the
steps
of
the
injured
desnoyers
thought
he
recognized
marguerite
in
every
one
of
them
but
the
prompt
disillusion
following
each
of
these
discoveries
soon
made
him
doubtful
about
the
outcome
of
his
journey
she
was
not
in
lourdes
either
he
would
never
find
her
in
that
france
so
immeasurably
expanded
by
the
war
that
it
had
converted
every
town
into
a
hospital
his
afternoon
explorations
were
no
more
successful
the
employees
listened
to
his
interrogations
with
a
distraught
air
he
could
come
back
again
just
now
they
were
taken
up
with
the
announcement
that
another
hospital
train
was
on
the
way
the
great
battle
was
still
going
on
near
paris
they
had
to
improvise
lodgings
for
the
new
consignment
of
mutilated
humanity
in
order
to
pass
away
the
time
until
his
return
desnoyers
went
back
to
the
garden
near
the
grotto
he
was
planning
to
return
to
pau
that
night
there
was
evidently
nothing
more
to
do
at
lourdes
in
what
direction
should
he
now
continue
his
search
suddenly
he
felt
a
thrill
down
his
back
the
same
indefinable
sensation
which
used
to
warn
him
of
her
presence
when
they
were
meeting
in
the
gardens
of
paris
marguerite
was
going
to
present
herself
unexpectedly
as
in
the
old
days
without
his
knowing
from
exactly
what
spot
as
though
she
came
up
out
of
the
earth
or
descended
from
the
clouds
after
a
second
s
thought
he
smiled
bitterly
mere
tricks
of
his
desire
illusions
upon
turning
his
head
he
recognized
the
falsity
of
his
hope
nobody
was
following
his
footsteps
he
was
the
only
being
going
down
the
center
of
the
avenue
near
him
in
the
diaphanous
white
of
a
guardian
angel
was
a
nurse
poor
blind
man
desnoyers
was
passing
on
when
a
quick
movement
on
the
part
of
the
woman
an
evident
desire
to
escape
notice
to
hide
her
face
by
looking
at
the
plants
attracted
his
attention
he
was
slow
in
recognizing
her
two
little
ringlets
escaping
from
the
band
of
her
cap
made
him
guess
the
hidden
head
of
hair
the
feet
shod
in
white
were
the
signs
which
enabled
him
to
reconstruct
the
person
somewhat
disfigured
by
the
severe
uniform
her
face
was
pale
and
sad
there
wasn
t
a
trace
left
in
it
of
the
old
vanities
that
used
to
give
it
its
childish
beauty
in
the
depths
of
those
great
eyes
life
seemed
to
be
reflected
in
new
forms
marguerite
they
stared
at
one
another
for
a
long
while
as
though
hypnotized
with
surprise
she
looked
alarmed
when
desnoyers
advanced
a
step
toward
her
no
no
her
eyes
her
hands
her
entire
body
seemed
to
protest
to
repel
his
approach
to
hold
him
motionless
fear
that
he
might
come
near
her
made
her
go
toward
him
she
said
a
few
words
to
the
soldier
who
remained
on
the
bench
receiving
across
the
bandage
on
his
face
a
ray
of
sunlight
which
he
did
not
appear
to
feel
then
she
rose
going
to
meet
julio
and
continued
forward
indicating
by
a
gesture
that
they
must
find
some
place
further
on
where
the
wounded
man
could
not
hear
them
she
led
the
way
to
a
side
path
from
which
she
could
see
the
blind
man
confided
to
her
care
they
stood
motionless
face
to
face
desnoyers
wished
to
say
many
things
many
but
he
hesitated
not
knowing
how
to
frame
his
complaints
his
pleadings
his
endearments
far
above
all
these
thoughts
towered
one
fatal
dominant
and
wrathful
who
is
that
man
the
spiteful
accent
the
harsh
voice
with
which
he
said
these
words
surprised
him
as
though
they
came
from
someone
else
s
mouth
the
nurse
looked
at
him
with
her
great
limpid
eyes
eyes
that
seemed
forever
freed
from
contractions
of
surprise
or
fear
her
response
slipped
from
her
with
equal
directness
it
is
laurier
it
is
my
laurier
julio
looked
doubtfully
and
for
a
long
time
at
the
soldier
before
he
could
be
convinced
that
blind
officer
motionless
on
the
bench
that
figure
of
heroic
grief
was
laurier
at
first
glance
he
appeared
prematurely
old
with
roughened
and
bronzed
skin
so
furrowed
with
lines
that
they
converged
like
rays
around
all
the
openings
of
his
face
his
hair
was
beginning
to
whiten
on
the
temples
and
in
the
beard
which
covered
his
cheeks
he
had
lived
twenty
years
in
that
one
month
at
the
same
time
he
appeared
younger
with
a
youthfulness
that
was
radiating
an
inward
vigor
with
the
strength
of
a
soul
which
has
suffered
the
most
violent
emotions
and
firm
and
serene
in
the
satisfaction
of
duty
fulfilled
can
no
longer
know
fear
as
desnoyers
contemplated
him
he
felt
both
admiration
and
jealousy
he
was
ashamed
to
admit
the
aversion
inspired
by
the
wounded
man
so
sorely
wounded
that
he
was
unable
to
see
what
was
going
on
around
him
his
hatred
was
a
form
of
cowardice
terrifying
in
its
persistence
how
pensive
were
marguerite
s
eyes
if
she
took
them
off
her
patient
for
a
few
seconds
she
had
never
looked
at
him
in
that
way
he
knew
all
the
amorous
gradations
of
her
glance
but
her
fixed
gaze
at
this
injured
man
was
something
entirely
different
something
that
he
had
never
seen
before
he
spoke
with
the
fury
of
a
lover
who
discovers
an
infidelity
and
for
this
thing
you
have
run
away
without
warning
without
a
word
you
have
abandoned
me
in
order
to
go
in
search
of
him
tell
me
why
did
you
come
why
did
you
come
i
came
because
it
was
my
then
she
spoke
like
a
mother
who
takes
advantage
of
a
parenthesis
of
surprise
in
an
irascible
child
s
temper
in
order
to
counsel
and
explained
how
it
had
all
happened
she
had
received
the
news
of
laurier
s
wounding
just
as
she
and
her
mother
were
preparing
to
leave
paris
she
had
not
hesitated
an
instant
her
duty
was
to
hasten
to
the
aid
of
this
man
she
had
been
doing
a
great
deal
of
thinking
in
the
last
few
weeks
the
war
had
made
her
ponder
much
on
the
values
in
life
her
eyes
had
been
getting
glimpses
of
new
horizons
our
destiny
is
not
mere
pleasure
and
selfish
satisfaction
we
ought
to
take
our
part
in
pain
and
sacrifice
she
had
wanted
to
work
for
her
country
to
share
the
general
stress
to
serve
as
other
women
did
and
since
she
was
disposed
to
devote
herself
to
strangers
was
it
not
natural
that
she
should
prefer
to
help
this
man
whom
she
had
so
greatly
wronged
there
still
lived
in
her
memory
the
moment
in
which
she
had
seen
him
approach
the
station
completely
alone
among
so
many
who
had
the
consolation
of
loving
arms
when
departing
in
search
of
death
her
pity
had
become
still
more
acute
on
hearing
of
his
misfortune
a
shell
had
exploded
near
him
killing
all
those
around
him
of
his
many
wounds
the
only
serious
one
was
that
on
his
face
he
had
completely
lost
the
sight
of
one
eye
and
the
doctors
were
keeping
the
other
bound
up
hoping
to
save
it
but
she
was
very
doubtful
about
it
she
was
almost
sure
that
laurier
would
be
blind
marguerite
s
voice
trembled
when
saying
this
as
if
she
were
going
to
cry
although
her
eyes
were
tearless
they
did
not
now
feel
the
irresistible
necessity
for
tears
weeping
had
become
something
superfluous
like
many
other
luxuries
of
peaceful
days
her
eyes
had
seen
so
much
in
so
few
days
how
you
love
him
exclaimed
julio
fearing
that
they
might
be
overheard
and
in
order
to
keep
him
at
a
distance
she
had
been
speaking
as
though
to
a
friend
but
her
lover
s
sadness
broke
down
her
reserve
no
i
love
you
i
shall
always
love
the
simplicity
with
which
she
said
this
and
her
sudden
tenderness
of
tone
revived
desnoyers
hopes
and
the
other
one
he
asked
anxiously
upon
receiving
her
reply
it
seemed
to
him
as
though
something
had
just
passed
across
the
sun
veiling
its
light
temporarily
it
was
as
though
a
cloud
had
drifted
over
the
land
and
over
his
thoughts
enveloping
them
in
an
unbearable
chill
i
love
him
she
said
it
with
a
look
that
seemed
to
implore
pardon
with
the
sad
sincerity
of
one
who
has
given
up
lying
and
weeps
in
foreseeing
the
injury
that
the
truth
must
inflict
he
felt
his
hard
wrath
suddenly
dwindling
like
a
crumbling
mountain
ah
marguerite
his
voice
was
tremulous
and
despairing
could
it
be
possible
that
everything
between
these
two
was
going
to
end
thus
simply
were
her
former
vows
mere
lies
they
had
been
attracted
to
each
other
by
an
irresistible
affinity
in
order
to
be
together
forever
to
be
one
and
now
suddenly
hardened
by
indifference
were
they
to
drift
apart
like
two
unfriendly
bodies
what
did
this
absurdity
about
loving
him
at
the
same
time
that
she
loved
her
former
husband
mean
anyway
marguerite
hung
her
head
murmuring
desperately
you
are
a
man
i
am
a
woman
you
would
never
understand
me
no
matter
what
i
might
say
men
are
not
able
to
comprehend
certain
of
our
mysteries
a
woman
would
be
better
able
to
appreciate
the
desnoyers
felt
that
he
must
know
his
fate
in
all
its
cruelty
she
might
speak
without
fear
he
felt
strong
enough
to
bear
the
blow
what
had
laurier
said
when
he
found
that
he
was
being
so
tenderly
cared
for
by
marguerite
he
does
not
know
who
i
am
he
believes
me
to
be
a
like
the
rest
who
pities
him
seeing
him
alone
and
blind
with
no
relatives
to
write
to
him
or
visit
him
at
certain
times
i
have
almost
suspected
that
he
guesses
the
truth
my
voice
the
touch
of
my
hands
made
him
shiver
at
first
as
though
with
an
unpleasant
sensation
i
have
told
him
that
i
am
a
beigian
lady
who
has
lost
her
loved
ones
and
is
alone
in
the
world
he
has
told
me
his
life
story
very
sketchily
as
if
he
desired
to
forget
a
hated
past
never
one
disagreeable
word
about
his
former
wife
there
are
nights
when
i
think
that
he
knows
me
that
he
takes
advantage
of
his
blindness
in
order
to
prolong
his
feigned
ignorance
and
that
distresses
me
i
long
for
him
to
recover
his
sight
for
the
doctors
to
save
that
doubtful
eye
and
yet
at
the
same
time
i
feel
afraid
what
will
he
say
when
he
recognizes
me
but
no
it
is
better
that
he
should
see
no
matter
what
may
result
you
can
not
understand
my
anxiety
you
can
not
know
what
i
am
she
was
silent
for
an
instant
trying
to
regain
her
again
tortured
with
the
agony
of
her
soul
oh
the
war
she
resumed
what
changes
in
our
life
two
months
ago
my
present
situation
would
have
appeared
impossible
unimaginable
i
caring
for
my
husband
fearing
that
he
would
discover
my
identity
and
leave
me
yet
at
the
same
time
wishing
that
he
would
recognize
me
and
pardon
me
it
is
only
one
week
that
i
have
been
with
him
i
disguise
my
voice
when
i
can
and
avoid
words
that
may
reveal
the
truth
but
this
can
not
keep
up
much
longer
it
is
only
in
novels
that
such
painful
situations
turn
out
doubt
suddenly
overwhelmed
her
i
believe
she
continued
that
he
has
recognized
me
from
the
first
he
is
silent
and
feigns
ignorance
because
he
despises
me
because
he
can
never
bring
himself
to
pardon
me
i
have
been
so
bad
i
have
wronged
him
so
she
was
recalling
the
long
and
reflective
silences
of
the
wounded
man
after
she
had
dropped
some
imprudent
words
after
two
days
of
submission
to
her
care
he
had
been
somewhat
rebellious
avoiding
going
out
with
her
for
a
walk
because
of
his
blind
helplessness
and
comprehending
the
uselessness
of
his
resistance
he
had
finally
yielded
in
passive
silence
let
him
think
what
he
will
concluded
marguerite
courageously
let
him
despise
me
i
am
here
where
i
ought
to
be
i
need
his
forgiveness
but
if
he
does
not
pardon
me
i
shall
stay
with
him
just
the
same
there
are
moments
when
i
wish
that
he
may
never
recover
his
sight
so
that
he
may
always
need
me
so
that
i
may
pass
my
life
at
his
side
sacrificing
everything
for
and
i
said
desnoyers
marguerite
looked
at
him
with
clouded
eyes
as
though
she
were
just
awaking
it
was
true
and
the
other
one
kindled
by
the
proposed
sacrifice
which
was
to
be
her
expiation
she
had
forgotten
the
man
before
her
you
she
said
after
a
long
pause
you
must
leave
me
life
is
not
what
we
have
thought
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
war
we
might
perhaps
have
realized
our
dream
but
now
listen
carefully
and
try
to
understand
for
the
remainder
of
my
life
i
shall
carry
the
heaviest
burden
and
yet
at
the
same
time
it
will
be
sweet
since
the
more
it
weighs
me
down
the
greater
will
my
atonement
be
never
will
i
leave
this
man
whom
i
have
so
grievously
wronged
now
that
he
is
more
alone
in
the
world
and
will
need
protection
like
a
child
why
do
you
come
to
share
my
fate
how
could
it
be
possible
for
you
to
live
with
a
nurse
constantly
at
the
side
of
a
blind
and
worthy
man
whom
we
would
constantly
offend
with
our
passion
no
it
is
better
for
us
to
part
go
your
way
alone
and
untrammelled
leave
me
you
will
meet
other
women
who
will
make
you
more
happy
than
yours
is
the
temperament
that
finds
new
pleasures
at
every
she
stood
firmly
to
her
decision
her
voice
was
calm
but
back
of
it
trembled
the
emotion
of
a
last
farewell
to
a
joy
which
was
going
from
her
forever
the
man
would
be
loved
by
others
and
she
was
giving
him
up
but
the
noble
sadness
of
the
sacrifice
restored
her
courage
only
by
this
renunciation
could
she
expiate
her
sins
julio
dropped
his
eyes
vanquished
and
perplexed
the
picture
of
the
future
outlined
by
marguerite
terrified
him
to
live
with
her
as
a
nurse
taking
advantage
of
her
patient
s
blindness
would
be
to
offer
him
fresh
insult
every
day
ah
no
that
would
be
villainy
indeed
he
was
now
ashamed
to
recall
the
malignity
with
which
a
little
while
before
he
had
regarded
this
innocent
unfortunate
he
realized
that
he
was
powerless
to
contend
with
him
weak
and
helpless
as
he
was
sitting
there
on
the
garden
bench
he
was
stronger
and
more
deserving
of
respect
than
julio
desnoyers
with
all
his
youth
and
elegance
the
victim
had
amounted
to
something
in
his
life
he
had
done
what
julio
had
not
dared
to
do
this
sudden
conviction
of
his
inferiority
made
him
cry
out
like
an
abandoned
child
what
will
become
of
me
marguerite
too
contemplating
the
love
which
was
going
from
her
forever
her
vanished
hopes
the
future
illumined
by
the
satisfaction
of
duty
fulfilled
but
monotonous
and
painful
cried
out
and
what
will
become
of
me
as
though
he
had
suddenly
found
a
solution
which
was
reviving
his
courage
desnoyers
said
listen
marguerite
i
can
read
your
soul
you
love
this
man
and
you
do
well
he
is
superior
to
me
and
women
are
always
attracted
by
superiority
i
am
a
coward
yes
do
not
protest
i
am
a
coward
with
all
my
youth
with
all
my
strength
why
should
you
not
have
been
impressed
by
the
conduct
of
this
man
but
i
will
atone
for
past
wrongs
this
country
is
yours
marguerite
i
will
fight
for
it
do
not
say
no
and
moved
by
his
hasty
heroism
he
outlined
the
plan
more
definitely
he
was
going
to
be
a
soldier
soon
she
would
hear
him
well
spoken
of
his
idea
was
either
to
be
stretched
on
the
battlefield
in
his
first
encounter
or
to
astound
the
world
by
his
bravery
in
this
way
the
impossible
situation
would
settle
itself
either
the
oblivion
of
death
or
glory
no
no
interrupted
marguerite
in
an
anguished
tone
you
no
one
is
enough
how
horrible
you
too
wounded
mutilated
forever
perhaps
dead
no
you
must
live
i
want
you
to
live
even
though
you
might
belong
to
another
let
me
know
that
you
exist
let
me
see
you
sometimes
even
though
you
may
have
forgotten
me
even
though
you
may
pass
me
with
indifference
as
if
you
did
not
know
in
this
outburst
her
deep
love
for
him
rang
true
her
heroic
and
inflexible
love
which
would
accept
all
penalties
for
herself
if
only
the
beloved
one
might
continue
to
live
but
then
in
order
that
julio
might
not
feel
any
false
hopes
she
added
live
you
must
not
die
that
would
be
for
me
another
torment
but
live
without
me
no
matter
how
much
we
may
talk
about
it
my
destiny
beside
the
other
one
is
marked
out
ah
how
you
love
him
how
you
have
deceived
me
in
a
last
desperate
attempt
at
explanation
she
again
repeated
what
she
had
said
at
the
beginning
of
their
interview
she
loved
julio
and
she
loved
her
husband
they
were
different
kinds
of
love
she
could
not
say
which
was
the
stronger
but
misfortune
was
forcing
her
to
choose
between
the
two
and
she
was
accepting
the
most
difficult
the
one
demanding
the
greatest
sacrifices
you
are
a
man
and
you
will
never
be
able
to
understand
me
a
woman
would
comprehend
it
seemed
to
julio
as
he
looked
around
him
as
though
the
afternoon
were
undergoing
some
celestial
phenomenon
the
garden
was
still
illuminated
by
the
sun
but
the
green
of
the
trees
the
yellow
of
the
ground
the
blue
of
the
sky
all
appeared
to
him
as
dark
and
shadowy
as
though
a
rain
of
ashes
were
falling
then
all
is
over
between
us
his
pleading
trembling
voice
charged
with
tears
made
her
turn
her
head
to
hide
her
emotion
then
in
the
painful
silence
the
two
despairs
formed
one
and
the
same
question
as
if
interrogating
the
shades
of
the
future
what
will
become
of
me
murmured
the
man
and
like
an
echo
her
lips
repeated
what
will
become
of
me
all
had
been
said
hopeless
words
came
between
the
two
like
an
obstacle
momentarily
increasing
in
size
impelling
them
in
opposite
directions
why
prolong
the
painful
interview
marguerite
showed
the
ready
and
energetic
decision
of
a
woman
who
wishes
to
bring
a
scene
to
a
close
her
face
had
assumed
a
yellowish
cast
her
pupils
had
become
dull
and
clouded
like
the
glass
of
a
lantern
when
the
light
dies
out
she
must
go
to
her
patient
she
went
away
without
looking
at
him
and
desnoyers
instinctively
went
in
the
opposite
direction
as
he
became
more
and
turned
to
look
at
her
again
he
saw
her
moving
on
and
giving
her
arm
to
the
blind
man
without
once
turning
her
head
he
now
felt
convinced
that
he
should
never
see
her
again
and
became
oppressed
by
an
almost
suffocating
agony
and
could
two
beings
who
had
formerly
considered
the
universe
concentrated
in
their
persons
thus
easily
be
separated
forever
his
desperation
at
finding
himself
alone
made
him
accuse
himself
of
stupidity
now
his
thoughts
came
tumbling
over
each
other
in
a
tumultuous
throng
and
each
one
of
them
seemed
to
him
sufficient
to
have
convinced
marguerite
he
certainly
had
not
known
how
to
express
himself
he
would
have
to
talk
with
her
again
and
he
decided
to
remain
in
lourdes
he
passed
a
night
of
torture
in
the
hotel
listening
to
the
ripple
of
the
river
among
its
stones
insomnia
had
him
in
his
fierce
jaws
gnawing
him
with
interminable
agony
he
turned
on
the
light
several
times
but
was
not
able
to
read
his
eyes
looked
with
stupid
fixity
at
the
patterns
of
the
wall
paper
and
the
pious
pictures
around
the
room
which
had
evidently
served
as
the
lodging
place
of
some
rich
traveller
he
remained
motionless
and
as
abstracted
as
an
oriental
who
thinks
himself
into
an
absolute
lack
of
thought
one
idea
only
was
dancing
in
the
vacuum
in
his
skull
i
shall
never
see
her
again
can
such
a
thing
be
possible
he
drowsed
for
a
few
seconds
only
to
be
awakened
with
the
sensation
that
some
horrible
explosion
was
sending
him
through
the
air
and
so
with
sweats
of
anguish
he
wakefully
passed
the
hours
until
in
the
gloom
of
his
room
the
dawn
showed
a
milky
rectangle
of
light
and
began
to
be
reflected
on
the
window
curtains
the
caress
of
day
finally
closed
his
eyes
upon
awaking
he
found
that
the
morning
was
well
advanced
and
he
hurried
to
the
garden
of
the
grotto
oh
the
hours
of
tremulous
and
unavailing
waiting
believing
that
he
recognized
marguerite
in
every
lady
that
came
along
guiding
a
wounded
patient
by
afternoon
after
a
lunch
whose
dishes
filed
past
him
untouched
he
returned
to
the
garden
in
search
of
her
beholding
her
in
the
distance
with
the
blind
man
leaning
on
her
arm
a
feeling
of
faintness
came
over
him
she
looked
to
him
taller
thinner
her
face
sharper
with
two
dark
hollows
in
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
bright
with
fever
the
lids
drawn
with
weariness
he
suspected
that
she
too
had
passed
an
anguished
night
of
tenacious
thought
of
grievous
stupefaction
like
his
own
in
the
room
of
her
hotel
suddenly
he
felt
all
the
weight
of
insomnia
and
listlessness
all
the
depressing
emotion
of
the
cruel
sensations
experienced
in
the
last
few
hours
oh
how
miserable
they
both
were
she
was
walking
warily
looking
from
one
side
to
the
other
as
though
foreseeing
danger
upon
discovering
him
she
clung
to
her
charge
casting
upon
her
former
lover
a
look
of
entreaty
of
desperation
imploring
pity
ay
that
look
he
felt
ashamed
of
himself
his
personality
appeared
to
be
unrolling
itself
before
him
and
he
surveyed
himself
with
the
eyes
of
a
judge
what
was
this
seduced
and
useless
man
called
julio
desnoyers
doing
there
tormenting
with
his
presence
a
poor
woman
trying
to
turn
her
from
her
righteous
repentance
insisting
on
his
selfish
and
petty
desires
when
all
humanity
was
thinking
of
other
things
his
cowardice
angered
him
like
a
thief
taking
advantage
of
the
sleep
of
his
victim
he
was
stalking
around
this
brave
and
true
man
who
could
not
see
him
who
could
not
defend
himself
in
order
to
rob
him
of
the
only
affection
that
he
had
in
the
world
which
had
so
miraculously
returned
to
him
very
well
gentleman
desnoyers
ah
what
a
scoundrel
he
was
such
subconscious
insults
made
him
draw
himself
erect
in
haughty
cruel
and
inexorable
defiance
against
that
other
i
who
so
richly
deserved
the
judge
s
scorn
he
turned
his
head
away
he
could
not
meet
marguerite
s
piteous
eyes
he
feared
their
mute
reproach
neither
did
he
dare
to
look
at
the
blind
man
in
his
shabby
and
heroic
uniform
with
his
countenance
aged
by
duty
and
glory
he
feared
him
like
remorse
so
the
vanquished
lover
turned
his
back
on
the
two
and
went
away
with
a
firm
step
love
goodbye
happiness
he
marched
quickly
and
bravely
on
a
miracle
had
just
taken
place
within
him
he
had
found
the
right
road
at
last
to
paris
a
new
impetus
was
going
to
fill
the
vacuum
of
his
objectless
existence
chapter
v
the
invasion
don
marcelo
was
fleeing
to
take
refuge
in
his
castle
when
he
met
the
mayor
of
villeblanche
the
noise
of
the
firing
had
made
him
hurry
to
the
barricade
when
he
learned
of
the
apparition
of
the
group
of
stragglers
he
threw
up
his
hands
in
despair
they
were
crazy
their
resistance
was
going
to
be
fatal
for
the
village
and
he
ran
on
to
beg
them
to
cease
for
some
time
nothing
happened
to
disturb
the
morning
calm
desnoyers
had
climbed
to
the
top
of
his
towers
and
was
surveying
the
country
with
his
field
glasses
he
couldn
t
make
out
the
highway
through
the
nearest
group
of
trees
but
he
suspected
that
underneath
their
branches
great
activity
was
going
on
masses
of
men
on
guard
troops
preparing
for
the
attack
the
unexpected
defense
of
the
fugitives
had
upset
the
advance
of
the
invasion
desnoyers
thought
despairingly
of
that
handful
of
mad
fellows
and
their
stubborn
chief
what
was
their
fate
going
to
be
focussing
his
glasses
on
the
village
he
saw
the
red
spots
of
kepis
waving
like
poppies
over
the
green
of
the
meadows
they
were
the
retreating
men
now
convinced
of
the
uselessness
of
their
resistance
perhaps
they
had
found
a
ford
or
forgotten
boat
by
which
they
might
cross
the
maine
and
so
were
continuing
their
retreat
toward
the
river
at
any
minute
now
the
germans
were
going
to
enter
villeblanche
half
an
hour
of
profound
silence
passed
by
the
village
lay
silhouetted
against
a
background
of
hills
a
mass
of
roofs
beneath
the
church
tower
finished
with
its
cross
and
iron
weather
cock
everything
seemed
as
tranquil
as
in
the
best
days
of
peace
suddenly
he
noticed
that
the
grove
was
vomiting
forth
something
noisy
and
penetrating
a
bubble
of
vapor
accompanied
by
a
deafening
report
something
was
hurtling
through
the
air
with
a
strident
curve
then
a
roof
in
the
village
opened
like
a
crater
vomiting
forth
flying
wood
fragments
of
plaster
and
broken
furniture
all
the
interior
of
the
house
seemed
to
be
escaping
in
a
stream
of
smoke
dirt
and
splinters
the
invaders
were
bombarding
villeblanche
before
attempting
attack
as
though
fearing
to
encounter
persistent
resistance
in
its
streets
more
projectiles
fell
some
passed
over
the
houses
exploding
between
the
hamlet
and
the
castle
the
towers
of
the
desnoyers
property
were
beginning
to
attract
the
aim
of
the
artillerymen
the
owner
was
therefore
about
to
abandon
his
dangerous
observatory
when
he
saw
something
white
like
a
tablecloth
or
sheet
floating
from
the
church
tower
his
neighbors
had
hoisted
this
signal
of
peace
in
order
to
avoid
bombardment
a
few
more
missiles
fell
and
then
there
was
silence
when
don
marcelo
reached
his
park
he
found
the
warden
burying
at
the
foot
of
a
tree
the
sporting
rifles
still
remaining
in
his
castle
then
he
went
toward
the
great
iron
gates
the
enemies
were
going
to
come
and
he
had
to
receive
them
while
uneasily
awaiting
their
arrival
his
compunctions
again
tormented
him
what
was
he
doing
there
why
had
he
remained
but
his
obstinate
temperament
immediately
put
aside
the
promptings
of
fear
he
was
there
because
he
had
to
guard
his
own
besides
it
was
too
late
now
to
think
about
such
things
suddenly
the
morning
stillness
was
broken
by
a
sound
like
the
deafening
tearing
of
strong
cloth
shots
master
said
the
warden
firing
it
must
be
in
the
a
few
minutes
after
they
saw
running
toward
them
a
woman
from
the
village
an
old
soul
dried
up
and
darkened
by
age
who
was
panting
from
her
great
exertion
and
looking
wildly
around
her
she
was
fleeing
blindly
trying
to
escape
from
danger
and
shut
out
horrible
visions
desnoyers
and
the
keeper
s
family
listened
to
her
explanations
interrupted
with
hiccoughs
of
terror
the
germans
were
in
villeblanche
they
had
entered
first
in
an
automobile
driven
at
full
speed
from
one
end
of
the
village
to
the
other
its
mitrailleuse
was
firing
at
random
against
closed
houses
and
open
doors
knocking
down
all
the
people
in
sight
the
old
woman
flung
up
her
arms
with
a
gesture
of
terror
dead
many
dead
wounded
blood
then
other
vehicles
had
stopped
in
the
square
and
behind
them
cavalrymen
battalions
of
infantry
many
battalions
coming
from
everywhere
the
helmeted
men
seemed
furious
they
accused
the
villagers
of
having
fired
at
them
in
the
square
they
had
struck
the
mayor
and
villagers
who
had
come
forward
to
meet
them
the
priest
bending
over
some
of
the
dying
had
also
been
trodden
under
foot
all
prisoners
the
germans
were
talking
of
shooting
them
the
old
dame
s
words
were
cut
short
by
the
rumble
of
approaching
automobiles
open
the
gates
commanded
the
owner
to
the
warden
the
massive
iron
grill
work
swung
open
and
was
never
again
closed
all
property
rights
were
at
an
end
an
enormous
automobile
covered
with
dust
and
filled
with
men
stopped
at
the
entrance
behind
them
sounded
the
horns
of
other
vehicles
that
were
putting
on
the
brakes
desnoyers
saw
soldiers
leaping
out
all
wearing
the
uniform
with
a
sheath
of
the
same
tone
covering
the
pointed
casque
the
one
who
marched
at
their
head
put
his
revolver
to
the
millionaire
s
forehead
where
are
the
sharpshooters
he
asked
he
was
pale
with
the
pallor
of
wrath
vengeance
and
fear
his
face
was
trembling
under
the
influence
of
his
triple
emotion
don
marcelo
explained
slowly
contemplating
at
a
short
distance
from
his
eyes
the
black
circle
of
the
threatening
tube
he
had
not
seen
any
sharpshooters
the
only
inhabitants
of
the
castle
were
the
warden
with
his
family
and
himself
the
owner
of
the
castle
the
officer
surveyed
the
edifice
and
then
examined
desnoyers
with
evident
astonishment
as
though
he
thought
his
appearance
too
unpretentious
for
a
proprietor
he
had
taken
him
for
a
simple
employee
and
his
respect
for
social
rank
made
him
lower
his
revolver
he
did
not
however
alter
his
haughty
attitude
he
pressed
don
marcelo
into
the
service
as
a
guide
making
him
search
ahead
of
him
while
forty
soldiers
grouped
themselves
at
his
back
they
advanced
in
two
files
to
the
shelter
of
the
trees
which
bordered
the
central
avenue
with
their
guns
ready
to
shoot
and
looking
uneasily
at
the
castle
windows
as
though
expecting
to
receive
from
them
hidden
shots
desnoyers
marched
tranquilly
through
the
centre
and
the
official
who
had
been
imitating
the
precautions
of
his
men
finally
joined
him
when
he
was
crossing
the
drawbridge
the
armed
men
scattered
through
the
rooms
in
search
of
the
enemy
they
ran
their
bayonets
through
beds
and
divans
some
with
automatic
destructiveness
slit
the
draperies
and
the
rich
bed
coverings
the
owner
protested
what
was
the
sense
in
such
useless
destruction
he
was
suffering
unbearable
torture
at
seeing
the
enormous
boots
spotting
the
rugs
with
mud
on
hearing
the
clash
of
guns
and
knapsacks
against
the
most
fragile
choicest
pieces
of
furniture
poor
historic
mansion
the
officer
looked
amazed
that
he
should
protest
for
such
trifling
cause
but
he
gave
orders
in
german
and
his
men
ceased
their
rude
explorations
then
in
justification
of
this
extraordinary
respect
he
added
in
french
i
believe
that
you
are
going
to
have
the
honor
of
entertaining
here
the
general
of
our
the
certainty
that
the
castle
did
not
hold
any
hidden
enemies
made
him
more
amiable
he
nevertheless
persisted
in
his
wrath
against
the
sharpshooters
a
group
of
the
villagers
had
opened
fire
upon
the
uhlans
when
they
were
entering
unsuspiciously
after
the
retreat
of
the
french
desnoyers
felt
it
necessary
to
protest
they
were
neither
inhabitants
nor
sharpshooters
they
were
french
soldiers
he
took
good
care
to
be
silent
about
their
presence
at
the
barricade
but
he
insisted
that
he
had
distinguished
their
uniforms
from
a
tower
of
the
castle
the
official
made
a
threatening
face
you
too
you
who
appear
a
reasonable
man
can
repeat
such
yarns
as
these
and
in
order
to
close
the
conversation
he
said
arrogantly
they
were
wearing
uniforms
then
if
you
persist
in
saying
so
but
they
were
sharpshooters
just
the
same
the
french
government
has
distributed
arms
and
uniforms
among
the
farmers
that
they
may
assassinate
us
belgium
did
the
same
thing
but
we
know
their
tricks
and
we
know
how
to
punish
them
too
the
village
was
going
to
be
burned
it
was
necessary
to
avenge
the
four
german
dead
lying
on
the
outskirts
of
villeblanche
near
the
barricade
the
mayor
the
priest
the
principal
inhabitants
would
all
be
shot
by
the
time
they
reached
the
top
floor
desnoyers
could
see
floating
above
the
boughs
of
his
park
dark
clouds
whose
outlines
were
reddened
by
the
sun
the
top
of
the
bell
tower
was
the
only
thing
that
he
could
distinguish
at
that
distance
around
the
iron
weathercock
were
flying
long
thin
fringes
like
black
cobwebs
lifted
by
the
breeze
an
odor
of
burning
wood
came
toward
the
castle
the
german
greeted
this
spectacle
with
a
cruel
smile
then
on
descending
to
the
park
he
ordered
desnoyers
to
follow
him
his
liberty
and
his
dignity
had
come
to
an
end
henceforth
he
was
going
to
be
an
underling
at
the
beck
and
call
of
these
men
who
would
dispose
of
him
as
their
whims
directed
ay
why
had
he
remained
he
obeyed
climbing
into
an
automobile
beside
the
officer
who
was
still
carrying
his
revolver
in
his
right
hand
his
men
distributed
themselves
through
the
castle
and
outbuildings
in
order
to
prevent
the
flight
of
an
imaginary
enemy
the
warden
and
his
family
seemed
to
be
saying
to
him
with
their
eyes
perhaps
they
were
taking
him
to
his
death
beyond
the
castle
woods
a
new
world
was
coming
into
existence
the
short
cut
to
villeblanche
seemed
to
desnoyers
a
leap
of
millions
of
leagues
a
fall
into
a
red
planet
where
men
and
things
were
covered
with
the
film
of
smoke
and
the
glare
of
fire
he
saw
the
village
under
a
dark
canopy
spotted
with
sparks
and
glowing
embers
the
bell
tower
was
burning
like
an
enormous
torch
the
roof
of
the
church
was
breaking
into
flames
with
a
crashing
fury
the
glare
of
the
holocaust
seemed
to
shrivel
and
grow
pale
in
the
impassive
light
of
the
sun
running
across
the
fields
with
the
haste
of
desperation
were
shrieking
women
and
children
the
animals
had
escaped
from
the
stables
and
driven
forth
by
the
flames
were
racing
wildly
across
the
country
the
cow
and
the
work
horse
were
dragging
their
halters
broken
by
their
flight
their
flanks
were
smoking
and
smelt
of
burnt
hair
the
pigs
the
sheep
and
the
chickens
were
all
tearing
along
mingled
with
the
cats
and
the
dogs
all
the
domestic
animals
were
returning
to
a
brute
existence
fleeing
from
civilized
man
shots
were
heard
and
hellish
s
the
soldiers
outside
of
the
village
were
making
themselves
merry
in
this
hunt
for
fugitives
their
guns
were
aimed
at
beasts
and
were
hitting
people
desnoyers
saw
men
many
men
men
everywhere
they
were
like
gray
ants
marching
in
endless
files
towards
the
south
coming
out
from
the
woods
filling
the
roads
crossing
the
fields
the
green
of
vegetation
was
disappearing
under
their
tread
the
dust
was
rising
in
spirals
behind
the
dull
roll
of
the
cannons
and
the
measured
trot
of
thousands
of
horses
on
the
roadside
several
battalions
had
halted
with
their
accompaniment
of
vehicles
and
draw
horses
they
were
resting
before
renewing
their
march
he
knew
this
army
he
had
seen
it
in
berlin
on
parade
and
yet
it
seemed
to
have
changed
its
former
appearance
there
now
remained
very
little
of
the
heavy
and
imposing
glitter
of
the
mute
and
vainglorious
haughtiness
which
had
made
his
weep
with
admiration
war
with
its
realism
had
wiped
out
all
that
was
theatrical
about
this
formidable
organization
of
death
the
soldiers
appeared
dirty
and
tired
out
the
respiration
of
fat
and
sweaty
bodies
mixed
with
the
strong
smell
of
leather
floated
over
the
regiments
all
the
men
had
hungry
faces
for
days
and
nights
they
had
been
following
the
heels
of
an
enemy
which
was
always
just
eluding
their
grasp
in
this
forced
advance
the
provisions
of
the
administration
would
often
arrive
so
late
at
the
cantonments
that
they
could
depend
only
on
what
they
happened
to
have
in
their
knapsacks
desnoyers
saw
them
lined
up
near
the
road
devouring
hunks
of
black
bread
and
mouldy
sausages
some
had
scattered
through
the
fields
to
dig
up
beet
roots
and
other
tubers
chewing
with
loud
crunchings
the
hard
pulp
to
which
the
grit
still
adhered
an
ensign
was
shaking
the
fruit
trees
using
as
a
the
flag
of
his
regiment
that
glorious
standard
adorned
with
souvenirs
of
was
serving
as
a
receptacle
for
green
plums
those
who
were
seated
on
the
ground
were
improving
this
rest
by
drawing
their
perspiring
swollen
feet
from
high
boots
which
were
sending
out
an
insufferable
smell
the
regiments
of
infantry
which
desnoyers
had
seen
in
berlin
reflecting
the
light
on
metal
and
leather
straps
the
magnificent
and
terrifying
hussars
the
cuirassiers
in
pure
white
uniform
like
the
paladins
of
the
holy
grail
the
artillerymen
with
breasts
crossed
with
white
bands
all
the
military
variations
that
on
parade
had
drawn
forth
the
hartrotts
sighs
of
admiration
these
were
now
all
unified
and
mixed
together
of
uniform
color
all
in
greenish
mustard
like
the
dusty
lizards
that
slipping
along
try
to
be
confounded
with
the
earth
the
persistency
of
the
iron
discipline
was
easily
discernible
a
word
from
the
chiefs
the
sound
of
a
whistle
and
they
all
grouped
themselves
together
the
human
being
disappearing
in
the
throngs
of
automatons
but
danger
weariness
and
the
uncertainty
of
triumph
had
for
the
time
being
brought
officers
and
men
nearer
together
obliterating
caste
distinction
the
officers
were
coming
part
way
out
of
their
overbearing
haughty
seclusion
and
were
condescending
to
talk
with
the
lower
orders
so
as
to
revive
their
courage
one
effort
more
and
they
would
overwhelm
both
french
and
english
repeating
the
triumph
of
sedan
whose
anniversary
they
were
going
to
celebrate
in
a
few
days
they
were
going
to
enter
paris
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
week
paris
great
shops
filled
with
luxurious
things
famous
restaurants
women
champagne
money
and
the
men
flattered
that
their
commanders
were
stooping
to
chat
with
them
forgot
fatigue
and
hunger
reviving
like
the
throngs
of
the
crusade
before
the
image
of
jerusalem
nach
paris
the
joyous
shout
circulated
from
the
head
to
the
tail
of
the
marching
columns
to
paris
to
paris
the
scarcity
of
their
food
supply
was
here
supplemented
by
the
products
of
a
country
rich
in
wines
when
sacking
houses
they
rarely
found
eatables
but
invariably
a
wine
cellar
the
humble
german
the
perpetual
beer
drinker
who
had
always
looked
upon
wine
as
a
privilege
of
the
rich
could
now
open
up
casks
with
blows
from
his
weapons
even
bathing
his
feet
in
the
stream
of
precious
liquid
every
battalion
left
as
a
souvenir
of
its
passing
a
wake
of
empty
bottles
a
halt
in
camp
sowed
the
land
with
glass
cylinders
the
regimental
trucks
unable
to
renew
their
stores
of
provisions
were
accustomed
to
seize
the
wine
in
all
the
towns
the
soldier
lacking
bread
would
receive
alcohol
this
donation
was
always
accompanied
by
the
good
counsels
of
the
officers
war
is
war
no
pity
toward
our
adversaries
who
do
not
deserve
it
the
french
were
shooting
their
prisoners
and
their
women
were
putting
out
the
eyes
of
the
wounded
every
dwelling
was
a
den
of
traps
the
and
innocent
german
entering
therein
was
going
to
certain
death
the
beds
were
made
over
subterranean
caves
the
wardrobes
were
doors
in
every
corner
was
lurking
an
assassin
this
traitorous
nation
which
was
arranging
its
ground
like
the
scenario
of
a
melodrama
would
have
to
be
chastised
the
municipal
officers
the
priests
the
schoolmasters
were
directing
and
protecting
the
sharpshooters
desnoyers
was
shocked
at
the
indifference
with
which
these
men
were
stalking
around
the
burning
village
they
did
not
appear
to
see
the
fire
and
destruction
it
was
just
an
ordinary
spectacle
not
worth
looking
at
ever
since
they
had
crossed
the
frontier
smoldering
and
blasted
villages
fired
by
the
advance
guard
had
marked
their
halting
places
on
belgian
and
french
soil
when
entering
villeblanche
the
automobile
had
to
lower
its
speed
burned
walls
were
bulging
out
over
the
street
and
beams
were
obstructing
the
way
obliging
the
vehicle
to
zigzag
through
the
smoking
rubbish
the
vacant
lots
were
burning
like
fire
pans
between
the
houses
still
standing
with
doors
broken
but
not
yet
in
flames
desnoyers
saw
within
these
rectangular
spaces
partly
burned
wood
chairs
beds
sewing
machines
iron
stoves
all
the
household
goods
of
the
countryman
being
consumed
or
twisted
into
shapeless
masses
sometimes
he
would
spy
an
arm
sticking
out
of
the
ruins
beginning
to
burn
like
a
long
wax
candle
no
it
could
not
be
possible
and
then
the
smell
of
cooking
flesh
began
to
mingle
with
that
of
the
soot
wood
and
plaster
he
closed
his
eyes
not
able
to
look
any
longer
he
thought
for
a
moment
he
must
be
dreaming
it
was
unbelievable
that
such
horrors
could
take
place
in
less
than
an
hour
human
wickedness
at
its
worst
he
had
supposed
incapable
of
changing
the
aspect
of
a
village
in
such
a
short
time
an
abrupt
stoppage
of
the
motor
made
him
look
around
involuntarily
this
time
the
obstruction
was
the
dead
bodies
in
the
street
two
men
and
a
woman
they
had
probably
fallen
under
the
rain
of
bullets
from
the
machine
gun
which
had
passed
through
the
town
preceding
the
invasion
some
soldiers
were
seated
a
little
beyond
them
with
their
backs
to
the
victims
as
though
ignoring
their
presence
the
chauffeur
yelled
to
them
to
clear
the
track
with
their
guns
and
feet
they
pushed
aside
the
bodies
still
warm
at
every
turn
leaving
a
trail
of
blood
the
space
was
hardly
opened
before
the
vehicle
shot
through
a
thud
a
leap
the
back
wheels
had
evidently
crushed
some
very
fragile
obstacle
desnoyers
was
still
huddled
in
his
seat
benumbed
and
with
closed
eyes
the
horror
around
him
made
him
think
of
his
own
fate
whither
was
this
lieutenant
taking
him
he
soon
saw
the
town
hall
flaming
in
the
square
the
church
was
now
nothing
but
a
stone
shell
bristling
with
flames
the
houses
of
the
prosperous
villagers
had
had
their
doors
and
windows
chopped
out
by
within
them
soldiers
were
moving
about
methodically
they
entered
and
came
out
loaded
with
furniture
and
clothing
others
in
the
upper
stories
were
flinging
out
various
objects
accompanying
their
trophies
with
jests
and
guffaws
suddenly
they
had
to
come
out
flying
for
fire
was
breaking
out
with
the
violence
and
rapidity
of
an
explosion
following
their
footsteps
was
a
group
of
men
with
big
boxes
and
metal
cylinders
someone
at
their
head
was
pointing
out
the
buildings
into
whose
broken
windows
were
to
be
thrown
the
lozenges
and
liquid
streams
which
would
produce
catastrophe
with
lightning
rapidity
out
of
one
of
these
flaming
buildings
two
men
who
seemed
but
bundles
of
rags
were
being
dragged
by
some
germans
above
the
blue
sleeves
of
their
military
cloaks
don
marcelo
could
distinguish
blanched
faces
and
eyes
immeasurably
distended
with
suffering
their
legs
were
dragging
on
the
ground
sticking
out
between
the
tatters
of
their
red
pantaloons
one
of
them
still
had
on
his
kepis
blood
was
gushing
from
different
parts
of
their
bodies
and
behind
them
like
white
serpents
were
trailing
their
loosened
bandages
they
were
wounded
frenchmen
stragglers
who
had
remained
in
the
village
because
too
weak
to
keep
up
with
the
retreat
perhaps
they
had
joined
the
group
which
finding
its
escape
cut
off
had
attempted
that
insane
resistance
wishing
to
make
that
matter
more
clearly
understood
desnoyers
looked
at
the
official
beside
him
attempting
to
speak
but
the
officer
silenced
him
instantly
french
sharpshooters
in
disguise
who
are
going
to
get
the
punishment
they
the
german
bayonets
were
sunk
deep
into
their
bodies
then
blows
with
the
guns
fell
on
the
head
of
one
of
them
and
these
blows
were
repeated
with
dull
thumps
upon
their
skulls
crackling
as
they
burst
open
again
the
old
man
wondered
what
his
fate
would
be
where
was
this
lieutenant
taking
him
across
such
visions
of
horror
they
had
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
village
where
the
dragoons
had
built
their
barricade
the
carts
were
still
there
but
at
one
side
of
the
road
they
climbed
out
of
the
automobile
and
he
saw
a
group
of
officers
in
gray
with
sheathed
helmets
like
the
others
the
one
who
had
brought
him
to
this
place
was
standing
rigidly
erect
with
one
hand
to
his
visor
speaking
to
a
military
man
standing
a
few
paces
in
front
of
the
others
he
looked
at
this
man
who
was
scrutinizing
him
with
his
little
hard
blue
eyes
that
had
carved
his
spare
furrowed
countenance
with
lines
he
must
be
the
general
his
arrogant
and
piercing
gaze
was
sweeping
him
from
head
to
foot
don
marcelo
felt
a
presentiment
that
his
life
was
hanging
on
this
examination
should
an
evil
suggestion
a
cruel
caprice
flash
across
this
brain
he
was
surely
lost
the
general
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
said
a
few
words
in
a
contemptuous
tone
then
entered
his
automobile
with
two
of
his
aids
and
the
group
disbanded
the
cruel
uncertainty
the
interminable
moments
before
the
official
returned
to
his
side
filled
desnoyers
with
dread
his
excellency
is
very
gracious
announced
the
lieutenant
he
might
have
shot
you
but
he
pardons
you
and
yet
you
people
say
that
we
are
savages
with
involuntary
contempt
he
further
explained
that
he
had
conducted
him
thither
fully
expecting
that
he
would
be
shot
the
general
was
planning
to
punish
all
the
prominent
residents
of
villeblanche
and
he
had
inferred
on
his
own
initiative
that
the
owner
of
the
castle
must
be
one
of
them
military
duty
sir
war
exacts
after
this
excuse
the
petty
official
renewed
his
eulogies
of
his
excellency
he
was
going
to
make
his
headquarters
in
don
marcelo
s
property
and
on
that
account
granted
him
his
life
he
ought
to
thank
him
then
again
his
face
trembled
with
wrath
he
pointed
to
some
bodies
lying
near
the
road
they
were
the
corpses
of
uhlans
covered
with
some
cloaks
from
which
were
protruding
the
enormous
soles
of
their
boots
plain
murder
he
exclaimed
a
crime
for
which
the
guilty
are
going
to
pay
dearly
his
indignation
made
him
consider
the
death
of
four
soldiers
as
an
and
monstrous
outrage
as
though
in
was
only
the
enemy
ought
to
fall
keeping
safe
and
sound
the
lives
of
his
compatriots
a
band
of
infantry
commanded
by
an
officer
approached
as
their
ranks
opened
desnoyers
saw
the
gray
uniforms
roughly
pushing
forward
some
of
the
inhabitants
their
clothes
were
torn
and
some
had
blood
on
face
and
hands
he
recognized
them
one
by
one
as
they
were
lined
up
against
the
mud
wall
at
twenty
paces
from
the
firing
squad
of
soldiers
the
mayor
the
priest
the
forest
guard
and
some
rich
villagers
whose
houses
he
had
seen
falling
in
flames
they
are
going
to
shoot
them
in
order
to
prevent
any
doubt
about
it
the
lieutenant
explained
i
wanted
you
to
see
this
it
will
serve
as
an
object
lesson
in
this
way
you
will
feel
more
appreciative
of
the
leniency
of
his
the
prisoners
were
mute
their
voices
had
been
exhausted
in
vain
protest
all
their
life
was
concentrated
in
their
eyes
looking
around
them
in
stupefaction
and
was
it
possible
that
they
would
kill
them
in
cold
blood
without
hearing
their
testimony
without
admitting
the
proofs
of
their
innocence
the
certainty
of
approaching
death
soon
gave
almost
all
of
them
a
noble
serenity
it
was
useless
to
complain
only
one
rich
countryman
famous
for
his
avarice
was
whimpering
desperately
saying
over
and
over
i
do
not
wish
to
die
i
do
not
want
to
die
trembling
and
with
eyes
overflowing
with
tears
desnoyers
hid
himself
behind
his
implacable
guide
he
knew
them
all
he
had
battled
with
them
all
and
repented
now
of
his
former
wrangling
the
mayor
had
a
red
stain
on
his
forehead
from
a
long
skin
wound
upon
his
breast
fluttered
a
tattered
tricolor
the
municipality
had
placed
it
there
that
he
might
receive
the
invaders
who
had
torn
most
of
it
away
the
priest
was
holding
his
little
round
body
as
erect
as
possible
wishing
to
embrace
in
a
look
of
resignation
the
victims
the
executioners
earth
and
heaven
he
appeared
larger
than
usual
and
more
imposing
his
black
girdle
broken
by
the
roughness
of
the
soldiers
left
his
cassock
loose
and
floating
his
waving
silvery
hair
was
dripping
blood
spotting
with
its
red
drops
the
white
clerical
collar
upon
seeing
him
cross
the
fatal
field
with
unsteady
step
because
of
his
obesity
a
savage
roar
cut
the
tragic
silence
the
unarmed
soldiers
who
had
hastened
to
witness
the
execution
greeted
the
venerable
old
man
with
shouts
of
laughter
death
to
the
priest
the
fanaticism
of
the
religious
wars
vibrated
through
their
mockery
almost
all
of
them
were
devout
catholics
or
fervent
protestants
but
they
believed
only
in
the
priests
of
their
own
country
outside
of
germany
everything
was
despicable
even
their
own
religion
the
mayor
and
the
priest
changed
their
places
in
the
file
seeking
one
another
each
with
solemn
courtesy
was
offering
the
other
the
central
place
in
the
group
here
your
honor
is
your
place
as
mayor
at
the
head
of
no
after
you
monsieur
le
they
were
disputing
for
the
last
time
but
in
this
supreme
moment
each
one
was
wishing
to
yield
precedence
to
the
other
instinctively
they
had
clasped
hands
looking
straight
ahead
at
the
firing
squad
that
had
lowered
its
guns
in
a
rigid
horizontal
line
behind
them
sounded
laments
my
children
adieu
life
i
do
not
wish
to
die
i
do
not
want
to
die
the
two
principal
men
felt
the
necessity
of
saying
something
of
closing
the
page
of
their
existence
with
an
affirmation
vive
la
republique
cried
the
mayor
vive
la
france
said
the
priest
desnoyers
thought
that
both
had
said
the
same
thing
two
uprights
flashed
up
above
their
heads
the
arm
of
the
priest
making
the
sign
of
the
cross
and
the
sabre
of
the
commander
of
the
shooters
glistening
at
the
same
instant
a
dry
dull
thunderclap
followed
by
some
scattering
tardy
shots
don
marcelo
s
compassion
for
that
forlorn
cluster
of
massacred
humanity
was
intensified
on
beholding
the
grotesque
forms
which
many
assumed
in
the
moment
of
death
some
collapsed
like
sacks
others
rebounded
from
the
ground
like
balls
some
leaped
like
gymnasts
with
upraised
arms
falling
on
their
backs
or
face
downward
like
a
swimmer
in
that
human
heap
he
saw
limbs
writhing
in
the
agony
of
death
some
soldiers
advanced
like
hunters
bagging
their
prey
from
the
palpitating
mass
fluttered
locks
of
white
hair
and
a
feeble
hand
trying
to
repeat
the
sacred
sign
a
few
more
shots
and
blows
on
the
livid
mangled
mass
and
the
last
tremors
of
life
were
extinguished
forever
the
officer
had
lit
a
cigar
whenever
you
wish
he
said
to
desnoyers
with
ironical
courtesy
they
the
automobile
in
order
to
return
to
the
castle
by
the
way
of
villeblanche
the
increasing
number
of
fires
and
the
dead
bodies
in
the
streets
no
longer
impressed
the
old
man
he
had
seen
so
much
what
could
now
affect
his
sensibilities
he
was
longing
to
get
out
of
the
village
as
soon
as
possible
to
try
to
find
the
peace
of
the
country
but
the
country
had
disappeared
under
the
invasion
soldier
s
horses
cannons
everywhere
wherever
they
stopped
to
rest
they
were
destroying
all
that
they
came
in
contact
with
the
marching
battalions
noisy
and
automatic
as
a
machine
were
preceded
by
the
fifes
and
drums
and
every
now
and
then
in
order
to
cheer
their
drooping
spirits
were
breaking
into
their
joyous
cry
nach
paris
the
castle
too
had
been
disfigured
by
the
invasion
the
number
of
guards
had
greatly
increased
during
the
owner
s
absence
he
saw
an
entire
regiment
of
infantry
encamped
in
the
park
thousands
of
men
were
moving
about
under
the
trees
preparing
the
dinner
in
the
movable
kitchens
the
flower
borders
of
the
gardens
the
exotic
plants
the
carefully
swept
and
gravelled
avenues
were
all
broken
and
spoiled
by
this
avalanche
of
men
beasts
and
vehicles
a
chief
wearing
on
his
sleeve
the
band
of
the
military
administration
was
giving
orders
as
though
he
were
the
proprietor
he
did
not
even
condescend
to
look
at
this
civilian
walking
beside
the
lieutenant
with
the
downcast
look
of
a
prisoner
the
stables
were
vacant
desnoyers
saw
his
last
animals
being
driven
off
with
sticks
by
the
helmeted
shepherds
the
costly
progenitors
of
his
herds
were
all
beheaded
in
the
park
like
mere
animals
in
the
chicken
houses
and
dovecotes
there
was
not
a
single
bird
left
the
stables
were
filled
with
thin
horses
who
were
gorging
themselves
before
overflowing
mangers
the
feed
from
the
barns
was
being
lavishly
distributed
through
the
avenue
much
of
it
lost
before
it
could
be
used
the
cavalry
horses
of
various
divisions
were
turned
loose
in
the
meadows
destroying
with
their
hoofs
the
canals
the
edges
of
the
slopes
the
level
of
the
ground
all
the
work
of
many
months
the
dry
wood
was
uselessly
burning
in
the
park
through
carelessness
or
mischief
someone
had
set
the
wood
piles
on
fire
the
trees
with
the
bark
dried
by
the
summer
heat
were
crackling
on
being
licked
by
the
flame
the
building
was
likewise
occupied
by
a
multitude
of
men
under
this
same
superintendent
the
open
windows
showed
a
continual
shifting
through
the
rooms
desnoyers
heard
great
blows
that
within
his
breast
ay
his
historic
mansion
the
general
was
going
to
establish
himself
in
it
after
having
examined
on
the
banks
of
the
marne
the
works
of
the
pontoon
builders
who
had
been
constructing
several
military
bridges
for
the
troops
don
marcelo
s
outraged
sense
of
ownership
forced
him
to
speak
he
feared
that
they
would
break
the
doors
of
the
locked
rooms
he
would
like
to
go
for
the
keys
in
order
to
give
them
up
to
those
in
charge
the
commissary
would
not
listen
to
him
but
continued
ignoring
his
existence
the
lieutenant
replied
with
cutting
amiability
it
is
not
necessary
do
not
trouble
yourself
after
this
considerate
remark
he
started
to
rejoin
his
regiment
but
deemed
it
prudent
before
losing
sight
of
desnoyers
to
give
him
a
little
advice
he
must
remain
quietly
at
the
castle
outside
he
might
be
taken
for
a
spy
and
he
already
knew
how
promptly
the
soldiers
of
the
emperor
settled
all
such
little
matters
he
could
not
remain
in
the
garden
looking
at
his
dwelling
from
any
distance
because
the
germans
who
were
going
and
coming
were
diverting
themselves
by
playing
practical
jokes
upon
him
they
would
march
toward
him
in
a
straight
line
as
though
they
did
not
see
him
and
he
would
have
to
hurry
out
of
their
way
to
avoid
being
thrown
down
by
their
mechanical
and
rigid
advance
finally
he
sought
refuge
in
the
lodge
of
the
keeper
whose
good
wife
stared
with
astonishment
at
seeing
him
drop
into
a
kitchen
chair
breathless
and
downcast
suddenly
aged
by
losing
the
remarkable
energy
that
had
been
the
wonder
of
his
advanced
years
ah
master
poor
master
of
all
the
events
attending
the
invasion
the
most
unbelievable
for
this
poor
woman
was
seeing
her
employer
take
refuge
in
her
cottage
what
is
ever
going
to
become
of
us
she
groaned
her
husband
was
in
constant
demand
by
the
invaders
his
excellency
s
assistants
installed
in
the
basement
apartments
of
the
castle
were
incessantly
calling
him
to
tell
them
the
whereabouts
of
things
which
they
could
not
find
from
every
trip
he
would
return
humiliated
his
eyes
filled
with
tears
on
his
forehead
was
the
black
and
blue
mark
of
a
blow
and
his
jacket
was
badly
torn
these
were
souvenirs
of
a
futile
attempt
at
opposition
during
his
master
s
absence
to
the
german
plundering
of
stables
and
castle
rooms
the
millionaire
felt
himself
linked
by
misfortune
to
these
people
considered
until
then
with
indifference
he
was
very
grateful
for
the
loyalty
of
this
sick
and
humble
man
and
the
poor
woman
s
interest
in
the
castle
as
though
it
were
her
own
touched
him
greatly
the
presence
of
their
daughter
brought
chichi
to
his
mind
he
had
passed
near
her
without
noting
the
transformation
in
her
seeing
her
just
the
same
as
when
with
her
little
dog
trot
she
had
accompanied
the
master
s
daughter
on
her
rounds
through
the
parks
and
grounds
now
she
was
a
woman
slender
and
full
grown
with
the
first
feminine
graces
showing
subtly
in
her
figure
her
mother
would
not
let
her
leave
the
lodge
fearing
the
soldiery
which
was
invading
every
other
spot
with
its
overflowing
current
filtering
into
all
open
places
breaking
every
obstacle
which
impeded
their
course
desnoyers
broke
his
despairing
silence
to
admit
that
he
was
feeling
hungry
he
was
ashamed
of
this
bodily
want
but
the
emotions
of
the
day
the
executions
seen
so
near
the
danger
still
threatening
had
awakened
in
him
a
nervous
appetite
the
fact
that
he
was
so
impotent
in
the
midst
of
his
riches
and
unable
to
avail
himself
of
anything
on
his
estate
but
aggravated
his
necessity
poor
master
again
exclaimed
the
faithful
soul
and
the
woman
looked
with
astonishment
at
the
millionaire
devouring
a
bit
of
bread
and
a
triangle
of
cheese
the
only
food
that
she
could
find
in
her
humble
dwelling
the
certainty
that
he
would
not
be
able
to
find
any
other
nourishment
no
matter
how
much
he
might
seek
it
greatly
sharpened
his
cravings
to
have
acquired
an
enormous
fortune
only
to
perish
with
hunger
at
the
end
of
his
existence
the
good
wife
as
though
guessing
his
thoughts
sighed
raising
her
eyes
beseechingly
to
heaven
since
the
early
morning
hours
the
world
had
completely
changed
its
course
ay
this
war
the
rest
of
the
afternoon
and
a
part
of
the
night
the
proprietor
kept
receiving
news
from
the
keeper
after
his
visits
to
the
castle
the
general
and
numerous
officers
were
now
occupying
the
rooms
not
a
single
door
was
locked
all
having
been
opened
with
blows
of
the
axe
or
gun
many
things
had
completely
disappeared
the
man
did
not
know
exactly
how
but
they
had
vanished
perhaps
destroyed
or
perhaps
carried
off
by
those
who
were
coming
and
going
the
chief
with
the
banded
sleeve
was
going
from
room
to
room
examining
everything
dictating
in
german
to
a
soldier
who
was
writing
down
his
orders
meanwhile
the
general
and
his
staff
were
in
the
dining
room
drinking
heavily
consulting
the
maps
spread
out
on
the
floor
and
ordering
the
warden
to
go
down
into
the
vaults
for
the
very
best
wines
by
nightfall
an
onward
movement
was
noticeable
in
the
human
tide
that
had
been
overflowing
the
fields
as
far
as
the
eye
could
reach
some
bridges
had
been
constructed
across
the
marne
and
the
invasion
had
renewed
its
march
shouting
enthusiastically
nach
paris
those
left
behind
till
the
following
day
were
to
live
in
the
ruined
houses
or
the
open
air
desnoyers
heard
songs
under
the
splendor
of
the
evening
stars
the
soldiers
had
grouped
themselves
in
musical
knots
chanting
a
sweet
and
solemn
chorus
of
religious
gravity
above
the
trees
was
floating
a
red
cloud
intensified
by
the
dusk
a
reflection
of
the
still
burning
village
afar
off
were
bonfires
of
farms
and
homesteads
twinkling
in
the
night
with
their
lights
the
bewildered
proprietor
of
the
castle
finally
fell
asleep
in
a
bed
in
the
lodge
made
mercifully
unconscious
by
the
heavy
and
stupefying
slumber
of
exhaustion
without
fright
nor
nightmare
he
seemed
to
be
falling
falling
into
a
bottomless
pit
and
on
awaking
fancied
that
he
had
slept
but
a
few
minutes
the
sun
was
turning
the
window
shades
to
an
orange
hue
spattered
with
shadows
of
waving
boughs
and
birds
fluttering
and
twittering
among
the
leaves
he
shared
their
joy
in
the
cool
refreshing
dawn
of
the
summer
day
it
certainly
was
a
fine
morning
but
whose
dwelling
was
this
he
gazed
dumbfounded
at
his
bed
and
surroundings
suddenly
the
reality
assaulted
his
brain
that
had
been
so
sweetly
dulled
by
the
first
splendors
of
the
day
step
by
step
the
host
of
emotions
compressed
into
the
preceding
day
came
climbing
up
the
long
stairway
of
his
memory
to
the
last
black
and
red
landing
of
the
night
before
and
he
had
slept
tranquilly
surrounded
by
enemies
under
the
surveillance
of
an
arbitrary
power
which
might
destroy
him
in
one
of
its
caprices
when
he
went
into
the
kitchen
the
warden
gave
him
some
news
the
germans
were
departing
the
regiment
encamped
in
the
park
had
left
at
daybreak
and
after
them
others
and
still
others
in
the
village
there
was
still
one
regiment
occupying
the
few
houses
yet
standing
and
the
ruins
of
the
charred
ones
the
general
had
gone
also
with
his
numerous
staff
there
was
nobody
in
the
castle
now
but
the
head
of
a
reserve
brigade
whom
his
aide
called
the
count
and
a
few
officials
upon
receiving
this
information
the
proprietor
ventured
to
leave
the
lodge
he
saw
his
gardens
destroyed
but
still
beautiful
the
trees
were
still
stately
in
spite
of
the
damage
done
to
their
trunks
the
birds
were
flying
about
excitedly
rejoicing
to
find
themselves
again
in
possession
of
the
spaces
so
recently
flooded
by
the
human
inundation
suddenly
desnoyers
regretted
having
sallied
forth
five
huge
trucks
were
lined
up
near
the
moat
before
the
castle
bridge
gangs
of
soldiers
were
coming
out
carrying
on
their
shoulders
enormous
pieces
of
furniture
like
peons
conducting
a
moving
a
bulky
object
wrapped
in
damask
curtains
an
excellent
substitute
for
sacking
was
being
pushed
by
four
men
toward
one
of
the
drays
the
owner
suspected
immediately
what
it
must
be
his
bath
the
famous
tub
of
gold
then
with
an
abrupt
revulsion
of
feeling
he
felt
no
grief
at
his
loss
he
now
detested
the
ostentatious
thing
attributing
to
it
a
fatal
influence
on
account
of
it
he
was
here
but
ay
the
other
furnishings
piled
up
in
the
drays
in
that
moment
he
suffered
the
extreme
agony
of
misery
and
impotence
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
defend
his
property
to
dispute
with
the
head
thief
who
was
sacking
his
castle
tranquilly
ignoring
the
very
existence
of
the
owner
robbers
thieves
and
he
fled
back
to
the
lodge
he
passed
the
remainder
of
the
morning
with
his
elbow
on
the
table
his
head
in
his
hands
the
same
as
the
day
before
letting
the
hours
grind
slowly
by
trying
not
to
hear
the
rolling
of
the
vehicles
that
were
bearing
away
these
credentials
of
his
wealth
toward
midday
the
keeper
announced
that
an
officer
who
had
arrived
a
few
hours
before
in
an
automobile
was
inquiring
for
him
responding
to
this
summons
desnoyers
encountered
outside
the
lodge
a
captain
arrayed
like
the
others
in
sheathed
and
pointed
helmet
in
uniform
red
leather
boots
sword
revolver
and
geographic
map
hanging
in
a
case
from
his
belt
he
appeared
young
on
his
sleeve
was
the
staff
emblem
do
you
know
me
i
did
not
wish
to
pass
through
here
without
seeing
he
spoke
in
castilian
and
don
marcelo
felt
greater
surprise
at
this
than
at
the
many
things
which
he
had
been
experiencing
so
painfully
during
the
last
hours
you
really
do
not
know
me
queried
the
german
always
in
spanish
i
am
otto
captain
otto
von
the
old
man
s
mind
went
painfully
down
the
staircase
of
memory
stopping
this
time
at
a
landing
there
he
saw
the
old
ranch
and
his
announcing
the
birth
of
his
second
son
i
shall
give
him
bismarck
s
name
karl
had
said
then
climbing
back
past
many
other
platforms
desnoyers
saw
himself
in
berlin
during
his
visit
to
the
von
hartrott
home
where
they
were
speaking
proudly
of
otto
almost
as
learned
as
the
older
brother
but
devoting
his
talents
entirely
to
martial
matters
he
was
then
a
lieutenant
and
studying
for
admission
to
the
general
staff
who
knows
but
he
may
turn
out
to
be
another
moltke
said
the
proud
father
and
the
charming
chichi
had
thereupon
promptly
bestowed
upon
the
warlike
wonder
a
nickname
accepted
through
the
family
from
that
time
otto
was
moltkecito
the
baby
moltke
to
his
parisian
relatives
desnoyers
was
astounded
by
the
transformation
which
had
meanwhile
taken
place
in
the
youth
this
vigorous
captain
with
the
insolent
air
who
might
shoot
him
at
any
minute
was
the
same
urchin
whom
he
had
seen
running
around
the
ranch
the
beardless
moltkecito
who
had
been
the
butt
of
his
daughter
s
ridicule
the
soldier
meanwhile
was
explaining
his
presence
there
he
belonged
to
another
division
there
were
many
many
they
were
advancing
rapidly
forming
an
extensive
and
solid
wall
from
verdun
to
paris
his
general
had
sent
him
to
maintain
the
contact
with
the
next
division
but
finding
himself
near
the
castle
he
had
wished
to
visit
it
a
family
tie
was
not
a
mere
word
he
still
remembered
the
days
that
he
had
spent
at
villeblanche
when
the
hartrott
family
had
paid
a
long
visit
to
their
relatives
in
france
the
officials
now
occupying
the
edifice
had
detained
him
that
he
might
lunch
with
them
one
of
them
had
casually
mentioned
that
the
owner
of
the
castle
was
somewhere
about
although
nobody
knew
exactly
where
this
had
been
a
great
surprise
to
captain
von
hartrott
who
had
tried
to
find
him
regretting
to
see
him
taking
refuge
in
the
warden
s
quarters
you
must
leave
this
hut
you
are
my
uncle
he
said
haughtily
return
to
your
castle
where
you
belong
my
comrades
will
be
much
pleased
to
make
your
acquaintance
they
are
very
distinguished
he
very
much
regretted
whatever
the
old
gentleman
might
have
suffered
he
did
not
know
exactly
in
what
that
suffering
had
consisted
but
surmised
that
the
first
moments
of
the
invasion
had
been
cruel
ones
for
him
but
what
else
can
you
expect
he
repeated
several
times
that
is
at
the
same
time
he
approved
of
his
having
remained
on
his
property
they
had
special
orders
to
seize
the
goods
of
the
fugitives
germany
wished
the
inhabitants
to
remain
in
their
dwellings
as
though
nothing
extraordinary
had
occurred
desnoyers
protested
but
if
the
invaders
were
shooting
the
innocent
ones
and
burning
their
homes
his
nephew
prevented
his
saying
more
he
turned
pale
an
ashy
hue
spreading
over
his
face
his
eyes
snapped
and
his
face
trembled
like
that
of
the
lieutenant
who
had
taken
possession
of
the
castle
you
refer
to
the
execution
of
the
mayor
and
the
others
my
comrades
have
just
been
telling
me
about
it
yet
that
castigation
was
very
mild
they
should
have
completely
destroyed
the
entire
village
they
should
have
killed
even
the
women
and
children
we
ve
got
to
put
an
end
to
these
his
uncle
looked
at
him
in
amazement
his
moltkecito
was
as
formidable
and
ferocious
as
the
others
but
the
captain
brought
the
conversation
to
an
abrupt
close
by
repeating
the
monstrous
and
everlasting
excuse
very
horrible
but
what
else
can
you
expect
that
is
he
then
inquired
after
his
mother
rejoicing
to
learn
that
she
was
in
the
south
he
had
been
uneasy
at
the
idea
of
her
remaining
in
paris
especially
with
all
those
revolutions
which
had
been
breaking
out
there
lately
desnoyers
looked
doubtful
as
if
he
could
not
have
heard
correctly
what
revolutions
were
those
but
the
officer
without
further
explanation
resumed
his
conversation
about
his
family
taking
it
for
granted
that
his
relative
would
be
impatient
to
learn
the
fate
of
his
german
kin
they
were
all
in
magnificent
state
their
illustrious
father
was
president
of
various
patriotic
societies
since
his
years
no
longer
permitted
him
to
go
to
war
and
was
besides
organizing
future
industrial
enterprises
to
improve
the
conquered
countries
his
brother
the
sage
was
giving
lectures
about
the
nations
that
the
imperial
victory
was
bound
to
annex
censuring
severely
those
whose
ambitions
were
unpretending
or
weak
the
remaining
brothers
were
distinguishing
themselves
in
the
army
one
of
them
having
been
presented
with
a
medal
at
lorraine
the
two
sisters
although
somewhat
depressed
by
the
absence
of
their
fiances
lieutenants
of
the
hussars
were
employing
their
time
in
visiting
the
hospitals
and
begging
god
to
chastise
traitorous
england
captain
von
hartrott
was
slowly
conducting
his
uncle
toward
the
castle
the
gray
and
unbending
soldiers
who
until
then
had
been
ignoring
the
existence
of
don
marcelo
looked
at
him
with
interest
now
that
he
was
in
intimate
conversation
with
a
member
of
the
general
staff
he
perceived
that
these
men
were
about
to
humanize
themselves
by
casting
aside
temporarily
their
inexorable
and
aggressive
automatonism
upon
entering
his
mansion
something
in
his
heart
contracted
with
an
agonizing
shudder
everywhere
he
could
see
dreadful
vacancies
which
made
him
recall
the
objects
which
had
formerly
been
there
rectangular
spots
of
stronger
color
announced
the
theft
of
furniture
and
paintings
with
what
despatch
and
system
the
gentleman
of
the
armlet
had
been
doing
his
work
to
the
sadness
that
the
cold
and
orderly
spoliation
caused
was
added
his
indignation
as
an
economical
man
gazing
upon
the
slashed
curtains
spotted
rugs
broken
crystal
and
porcelain
all
the
debris
from
a
ruthless
and
unscrupulous
occupation
his
nephew
divining
his
thoughts
could
only
offer
the
same
old
excuse
what
a
mess
but
that
is
war
with
moltkecito
he
did
not
have
to
subside
into
the
respectful
civilities
of
fear
that
is
not
war
he
thundered
bitterly
it
is
an
expedition
of
bandits
your
comrades
are
nothing
less
than
captain
von
hartrott
swelled
up
with
a
jerk
separating
himself
from
the
complainant
and
looking
fixedly
at
him
he
spoke
in
a
low
voice
hissing
with
wrath
look
here
uncle
it
is
a
lucky
thing
for
you
that
you
have
expressed
yourself
in
spanish
and
those
around
you
could
not
understand
you
if
you
persist
in
such
comments
you
will
probably
receive
a
bullet
by
way
of
an
answer
the
emperor
s
officials
permit
no
and
his
threatening
attitude
demonstrated
the
facility
with
which
he
could
forget
his
relationship
if
he
should
receive
orders
to
proceed
against
don
marcelo
thus
silenced
the
vanquished
proprietor
hung
his
head
what
was
he
going
to
do
the
captain
now
renewed
his
affability
as
though
he
had
forgotten
what
he
had
just
said
he
wished
to
present
him
to
his
his
excellency
count
meinbourg
the
major
general
upon
learning
that
he
was
a
relative
of
the
von
hartrotts
had
done
him
the
honor
of
inviting
him
to
his
table
invited
into
his
own
demesne
he
finally
reached
the
dining
room
filled
with
men
in
mustard
color
and
high
boots
instinctively
he
made
an
inventory
of
the
room
all
in
good
order
nothing
broken
walls
draperies
and
furniture
still
intact
but
an
appraising
glance
within
the
sideboard
again
caused
a
clutch
at
his
heart
two
entire
table
services
of
silver
and
another
of
old
porcelain
had
disappeared
without
leaving
the
most
insignificant
of
their
pieces
he
was
obliged
to
respond
gravely
to
the
presentations
which
his
nephew
was
making
and
take
the
hand
which
the
count
was
extending
with
aristocratic
languor
the
adversary
began
considering
him
with
benevolence
on
learning
that
he
was
a
millionaire
from
a
distant
land
where
riches
were
acquired
very
rapidly
soon
he
was
seated
as
a
stranger
at
his
own
table
eating
from
the
same
dishes
that
his
family
were
accustomed
to
use
served
by
men
with
shaved
heads
wearing
coarse
striped
aprons
over
their
uniforms
that
which
he
was
eating
was
his
the
wine
was
from
his
vaults
all
that
adorned
the
room
he
had
bought
the
trees
whose
boughs
were
waving
outside
the
window
also
belonged
to
him
and
yet
he
felt
as
though
he
were
in
this
place
for
the
first
time
with
all
the
discomfort
and
diffidence
of
a
total
stranger
he
ate
because
he
was
hungry
but
the
food
and
wines
seemed
to
have
come
from
another
planet
he
continued
looking
with
consternation
at
those
occupying
the
places
of
his
wife
children
and
the
lacours
they
were
speaking
in
german
among
themselves
but
those
having
a
limited
knowledge
of
french
frequently
availed
themselves
of
that
language
in
order
that
their
guest
might
understand
them
those
who
could
only
mumble
a
few
words
repeated
them
to
an
accompaniment
of
amiable
smiles
all
were
displaying
an
amicable
desire
to
propitiate
the
owner
of
the
castle
you
are
going
to
lunch
with
the
barbarians
said
the
count
offering
him
a
seat
at
his
side
aren
t
you
afraid
that
we
may
eat
you
alive
the
germans
burst
into
roars
of
laughter
at
the
wit
of
his
excellency
they
all
took
great
pains
to
demonstrate
by
word
and
manner
that
barbarity
was
wrongly
attributed
to
them
by
their
enemies
don
marcelo
looked
from
one
to
another
the
fatigues
of
war
especially
the
forced
march
of
the
last
days
were
very
apparent
in
their
persons
some
were
tall
and
slender
with
an
angular
slimness
others
were
stocky
and
corpulent
with
short
neck
and
head
sunk
between
the
shoulders
these
had
lost
much
of
their
fat
in
a
month
s
campaign
the
wrinkled
and
flabby
skin
hanging
in
folds
in
various
parts
of
their
bodies
all
had
shaved
heads
the
same
as
the
soldiers
around
the
table
shone
two
rows
of
cranial
spheres
reddish
or
dark
their
ears
stood
out
grotesquely
and
their
jaw
bones
were
in
strong
relief
owing
to
their
thinness
some
had
preserved
the
upright
moustache
in
the
style
of
the
emperor
the
most
of
them
were
shaved
or
had
a
stubby
tuft
like
a
brush
a
golden
bracelet
glistened
on
the
wrist
of
the
count
stretched
on
the
table
he
was
the
oldest
of
them
all
and
the
only
one
that
kept
his
hair
of
a
frosty
red
carefully
combed
and
glistening
with
pomade
although
about
fifty
years
old
he
still
maintained
a
youthful
vigor
cultivated
by
exercise
wrinkled
bony
and
strong
he
tried
to
dissimulate
his
uncouthness
as
a
man
of
battle
under
a
suave
and
indolent
laziness
the
officers
treated
him
with
the
greatest
respect
hartrott
told
his
uncle
that
the
count
was
a
great
artist
musician
and
poet
the
emperor
was
his
friend
they
had
known
each
other
from
boyhood
before
the
war
certain
scandals
concerning
his
private
life
had
exiled
him
from
court
mere
lampoons
of
the
socialists
and
the
kaiser
had
always
kept
a
secret
affection
for
his
former
chum
everybody
remembered
his
dance
the
caprices
of
scheherazade
represented
with
the
greatest
luxury
in
berlin
through
the
endorsement
of
his
powerful
friend
william
ii
the
count
had
lived
many
years
in
the
orient
in
fact
he
was
a
great
gentleman
and
an
artist
of
exquisite
sensibility
as
well
as
a
soldier
since
desnoyers
was
now
his
guest
the
count
could
not
permit
him
to
remain
silent
so
he
made
an
opportunity
of
bringing
him
into
the
conversation
did
you
see
any
of
the
insurrections
did
the
troops
have
to
kill
many
people
how
about
the
assassination
of
poincare
he
asked
these
questions
in
quick
succession
and
don
marcelo
bewildered
by
their
absurdity
did
not
know
how
to
reply
he
believed
that
he
must
have
fallen
in
with
a
feast
of
fools
then
he
suspected
that
they
were
making
fun
of
him
uprisings
assassinations
of
the
president
some
gazed
at
him
with
pity
because
of
his
ignorance
others
with
suspicion
believing
that
he
was
merely
pretending
not
to
know
of
these
events
which
had
happened
so
near
him
his
nephew
insisted
the
daily
papers
in
germany
have
been
full
of
accounts
of
these
matters
fifteen
days
ago
the
people
of
paris
revolted
against
the
government
bombarding
the
palais
de
l
elysee
and
assassinating
the
president
the
army
had
to
resort
to
the
machine
guns
before
order
could
be
restored
everybody
knows
but
desnoyers
insisted
that
he
did
not
know
it
that
nobody
had
seen
such
things
and
as
his
words
were
received
in
an
atmosphere
of
malicious
doubt
he
preferred
to
be
silent
his
excellency
superior
spirit
incapable
of
being
associated
with
the
popular
credulity
here
intervened
to
set
matters
straight
the
report
of
the
assassination
was
perhaps
not
certain
the
german
periodicals
might
have
unconsciously
exaggerated
it
just
a
few
hours
ago
the
general
of
the
staff
had
told
him
of
the
flight
of
the
french
government
to
bordeaux
and
the
statement
about
the
revolution
in
paris
and
the
firing
of
the
french
troops
was
indisputable
the
gentleman
has
seen
it
all
without
doubt
but
does
not
wish
to
admit
desnoyers
felt
obliged
to
contradict
this
lordling
but
his
negative
was
not
even
listened
to
paris
this
name
made
all
eyes
glisten
and
everybody
talkative
as
soon
as
possible
they
wished
to
reach
the
eiffel
tower
to
enter
victorious
into
the
city
to
receive
their
recompense
for
the
privations
and
fatigues
of
a
month
s
campaign
they
were
devotees
of
military
glory
they
considered
war
necessary
to
existence
and
yet
they
were
bewailing
the
hardship
that
it
was
imposing
upon
them
the
count
exhaled
the
plaint
of
the
craftsmaster
oh
the
havoc
that
this
war
has
brought
in
my
plans
he
sighed
this
winter
they
were
going
to
bring
out
my
dance
in
paris
they
all
protested
at
his
sadness
his
work
would
surely
be
presented
after
the
triumph
and
the
french
would
have
to
recognize
it
it
will
not
be
the
same
thing
complained
the
count
i
confess
that
i
adore
paris
what
a
pity
that
these
people
have
never
wished
to
be
on
familiar
terms
with
us
and
he
relapsed
into
the
silence
of
the
unappreciated
man
desnoyers
suddenly
recognized
in
one
of
the
officers
who
was
talking
with
eyes
bulging
with
covetousness
of
the
riches
of
paris
the
chief
thief
with
the
band
on
his
arm
he
it
was
who
so
methodically
had
sacked
the
castle
as
though
divining
the
old
frenchman
s
thought
the
commissary
began
excusing
himself
it
is
war
monsieur
the
same
as
the
others
war
had
to
be
paid
with
the
treasures
of
the
conquered
that
was
the
new
german
system
the
healthy
return
to
the
wars
of
ancient
days
tributes
imposed
on
the
cities
and
each
house
sacked
separately
in
this
way
the
enemy
s
resistance
would
be
more
effectually
overcome
and
the
war
soon
brought
to
a
close
he
ought
not
to
be
downcast
over
the
appropriations
for
his
furnishings
and
ornaments
would
all
be
sold
in
germany
after
the
french
defeat
he
could
place
a
remonstrance
claim
with
his
government
petitioning
it
to
indemnify
his
loss
his
relatives
in
berlin
would
support
his
demand
desnoyers
listened
in
consternation
to
his
counsels
what
kind
of
mentality
had
these
men
anyway
were
they
insane
or
were
they
trying
to
have
some
fun
at
his
expense
when
the
lunch
was
at
last
ended
the
officers
arose
and
adjusted
their
swords
for
service
captain
von
hartrott
rose
too
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
return
to
his
general
he
had
already
dedicated
too
much
time
to
family
expansion
his
uncle
accompanied
him
to
the
automobile
where
moltkecito
once
more
justified
the
ruin
and
plunder
of
the
castle
it
is
war
we
have
to
be
very
ruthless
that
it
may
not
last
long
true
kindness
consists
in
being
cruel
because
then
the
enemy
gives
in
sooner
and
so
the
world
suffers
don
marcelo
shrugged
his
shoulders
before
this
sophistry
in
the
doorway
the
captain
gave
some
orders
to
a
soldier
who
soon
returned
with
a
bit
of
chalk
which
had
been
used
to
number
the
lodging
places
von
hartrott
wished
to
protect
his
uncle
and
began
tracing
on
the
wall
near
the
door
bitte
nicht
plundern
es
sind
freundliche
in
response
to
the
old
man
s
repeated
questions
he
then
translated
the
inscription
it
means
please
do
not
sack
this
house
its
occupants
are
kind
people
friendly
ah
no
desnoyers
repelled
this
protection
vehemently
he
did
not
wish
to
be
kind
he
was
silent
because
he
could
not
be
anything
else
but
a
friend
of
the
invaders
of
his
country
no
no
no
his
nephew
rubbed
out
part
of
the
lettering
leaving
the
first
words
bitte
nicht
then
he
repeated
the
scrawled
request
at
the
entrance
of
the
park
he
thought
this
notice
advisable
because
his
excellency
might
go
away
and
other
officials
might
be
installed
in
the
castle
von
hartrott
had
seen
much
and
his
smile
seemed
to
imply
that
nothing
could
surprise
him
no
matter
how
outrageous
it
might
be
but
his
relative
continued
scorning
his
protection
and
laughing
bitterly
at
the
impromptu
signboard
what
more
could
they
carry
off
had
they
not
already
stolen
the
best
uncle
soon
we
shall
meet
in
and
the
captain
climbed
into
his
automobile
extending
a
soft
cold
hand
that
seemed
to
repel
the
old
man
with
its
flabbiness
upon
returning
to
his
castle
he
saw
a
table
and
some
chairs
in
the
shadow
of
a
group
of
trees
his
excellency
was
taking
his
coffee
in
the
open
air
and
obliged
him
to
take
a
seat
beside
him
only
three
officers
were
keeping
him
company
there
was
here
a
grand
consumption
of
liquors
from
his
wine
cellars
they
were
talking
together
in
german
and
for
an
hour
don
marcelo
remained
there
anxious
to
go
but
never
finding
the
opportune
moment
to
leave
his
seat
and
disappear
he
employed
his
time
in
imagining
the
great
stir
among
the
troops
hidden
by
the
trees
another
division
of
the
army
was
passing
by
with
the
incessant
deafening
roar
of
the
sea
an
inexplicable
phenomenon
kept
the
luminous
calm
of
the
afternoon
in
a
continuous
state
of
vibration
a
constant
thundering
sounded
afar
off
as
though
an
invisible
storm
were
always
approaching
from
beyond
the
blue
horizon
line
the
count
noticing
his
evident
interest
in
the
noise
interrupted
his
german
chat
to
explain
it
is
the
cannon
a
battle
is
going
on
soon
we
shall
join
in
the
the
possibility
of
having
to
give
up
his
quarters
here
the
most
comfortable
that
he
had
found
in
all
the
campaign
put
his
excellency
in
a
bad
humor
war
he
sighed
a
glorious
life
but
dirty
and
deadening
in
an
entire
month
is
the
first
that
i
have
lived
as
a
and
as
though
attracted
by
the
luxuries
that
he
might
shortly
have
to
abandon
he
rose
and
went
toward
the
castle
two
of
the
germans
betook
themselves
toward
the
village
and
desnoyers
remained
with
the
other
officer
who
was
delightfully
sampling
his
liquors
he
was
the
chief
of
the
battalion
encamped
in
the
village
this
is
a
sad
war
monsieur
he
said
in
french
of
all
the
inimical
group
this
man
was
the
only
one
for
whom
don
marcelo
felt
a
vague
attraction
although
a
german
he
appears
a
good
sort
meditated
the
old
man
eyeing
him
carefully
in
times
of
peace
he
must
have
been
stout
but
now
he
showed
the
loose
and
flaccid
exterior
of
one
who
has
just
lost
much
in
weight
desnoyers
surmised
that
the
man
had
formerly
lived
in
tranquil
and
vulgar
sensuousness
in
a
happiness
suddenly
cut
short
by
war
what
a
life
monsieur
the
officer
rambled
on
may
god
punish
well
those
who
have
provoked
this
catastrophe
the
frenchman
was
almost
affected
this
man
represented
the
germany
that
he
had
many
times
imagined
a
sweet
and
tranquil
germany
composed
of
burghers
a
little
heavy
and
slow
perhaps
but
atoning
for
their
natural
uncouthness
by
an
innocent
and
poetic
sentimentalism
this
blumhardt
whom
his
companions
called
was
undoubtedly
the
good
father
of
a
large
family
he
fancied
him
walking
with
his
wife
and
children
under
the
lindens
of
a
provincial
square
all
listening
with
religious
unction
to
the
melodies
played
by
a
military
band
then
he
saw
him
in
the
beer
gardens
with
his
friends
discussing
metaphysical
problems
between
business
conversations
he
was
a
man
from
old
germany
a
character
from
a
romance
by
goethe
perhaps
the
glory
of
the
empire
had
modified
his
existence
and
instead
of
going
to
the
beer
gardens
he
was
now
accustomed
to
frequent
the
officers
casino
while
his
family
maintained
a
separate
existence
separated
from
the
civilians
by
the
superciliousness
of
military
caste
but
at
heart
he
was
always
the
good
german
ready
to
weep
copiously
before
an
affecting
family
scene
or
a
fragment
of
good
music
commandant
blumhardt
meanwhile
was
thinking
of
his
family
living
in
cassel
there
are
eight
children
monsieur
he
said
with
a
visible
effort
to
control
emotion
the
two
eldest
are
preparing
to
become
officers
the
youngest
is
starting
school
this
year
he
is
just
so
and
with
his
right
hand
he
measured
off
the
child
s
diminutive
stature
he
trembled
with
laughter
and
grief
at
recalling
the
little
chap
then
he
broke
forth
into
eulogies
about
his
wife
excellent
manager
of
the
home
a
mother
who
was
always
modestly
sacrificing
herself
for
her
children
and
husband
ay
the
sweet
augusta
after
twenty
years
of
married
life
he
adored
her
as
on
the
day
he
first
saw
her
in
a
pocket
of
his
uniform
he
was
keeping
all
the
letters
that
she
had
written
him
since
the
beginning
of
the
campaign
look
at
her
monsieur
there
are
my
from
his
breast
pocket
he
had
drawn
forth
a
silver
medallion
adorned
with
the
art
of
munich
and
touching
a
spring
he
displayed
the
pictures
of
all
the
family
the
frau
kommandeur
of
an
austere
and
frigid
beauty
imitating
the
air
and
coiffure
of
the
empress
the
frauleine
kommandeur
clad
in
white
with
uplifted
eyes
as
though
they
were
singing
a
musical
romance
and
at
the
end
the
children
in
the
uniforms
of
the
army
schools
or
private
institutions
and
to
think
that
he
might
lose
these
beloved
beings
if
a
bit
of
iron
should
hit
him
and
he
had
to
live
far
from
them
now
that
it
was
such
fine
weather
for
long
walks
in
the
country
sad
war
he
again
said
may
god
punish
the
english
with
a
solicitude
that
don
marcelo
greatly
appreciated
he
in
turn
inquired
about
the
frenchman
s
family
he
pitied
him
for
having
so
few
children
and
smiled
a
little
over
the
enthusiasm
with
which
the
old
gentleman
spoke
of
his
daughter
saluting
fraulein
chichi
as
a
witty
sprite
and
expressing
great
sympathy
on
learning
that
the
only
son
was
causing
his
parents
great
sorrow
by
his
conduct
commandant
he
was
the
first
rational
and
human
being
that
he
had
met
in
this
hell
of
an
invasion
there
are
good
people
everywhere
he
told
himself
he
hoped
that
this
new
acquaintance
would
not
be
moved
from
the
castle
for
if
the
germans
had
to
stay
there
it
would
better
be
this
man
than
the
others
an
orderly
came
to
summon
don
marcelo
to
the
presence
of
his
excellency
after
passing
through
the
salons
with
closed
eyes
so
as
to
avoid
useless
distress
and
wrath
he
found
the
count
in
his
own
bedroom
the
doors
had
been
forced
open
the
floors
stripped
of
carpet
and
the
window
frames
of
curtains
only
the
pieces
of
furniture
broken
in
the
first
moments
now
occupied
their
former
places
the
sleeping
rooms
had
been
stripped
more
methodically
everything
having
been
taken
that
was
not
required
for
immediate
use
because
the
general
with
his
suite
had
been
lodging
there
the
night
before
this
apartment
had
escaped
the
arbitrary
destruction
the
count
received
him
with
the
civility
of
a
grandee
who
wishes
to
be
attentive
to
his
guests
he
could
not
consent
that
herr
desnoyers
a
relative
of
a
von
hartrott
whom
he
vaguely
remembered
having
seen
at
court
should
be
staying
in
the
keeper
s
lodge
he
must
return
to
his
own
room
occupying
that
bed
solemn
as
a
catafalque
with
columns
and
plumes
which
had
had
the
honor
a
few
hours
before
of
serving
as
the
of
an
illustrious
general
of
the
empire
i
myself
prefer
to
sleep
here
he
added
condescendingly
this
other
habitation
accords
better
with
my
while
saying
this
he
was
entering
dona
luisa
s
rooms
admiring
its
louis
quinze
furniture
of
genuine
value
with
its
dull
golds
and
tapestries
mellowed
by
time
it
was
one
of
the
most
successful
purchases
that
don
marcelo
had
made
the
count
smiled
with
an
artist
s
scorn
as
he
recalled
the
man
who
had
superintended
the
official
sacking
what
an
ass
to
think
that
he
left
this
behind
supposing
that
it
was
old
and
ugly
then
he
looked
the
owner
of
the
castle
squarely
in
the
face
monsieur
desnoyers
i
do
not
believe
that
i
am
committing
any
indiscretion
and
even
imagine
that
i
am
interpreting
your
desires
when
i
inform
you
that
i
intend
taking
this
set
of
furniture
with
me
it
will
serve
as
a
souvenir
of
our
acquaintance
a
testimony
to
the
friendship
springing
up
between
us
if
it
remains
here
it
will
run
the
risk
of
being
destroyed
warriors
of
course
are
not
obliged
to
be
artists
i
will
guard
these
excellent
treasures
in
germany
where
you
may
see
them
whenever
you
wish
we
are
all
going
to
be
one
nation
you
know
my
friend
the
emperor
is
soon
to
be
proclaimed
sovereign
of
the
desnoyers
remained
silent
how
could
he
reply
to
that
look
of
cruel
irony
to
the
grimace
with
which
the
noble
lord
was
underscoring
his
words
when
the
war
is
ended
i
will
send
you
a
gift
from
berlin
he
added
in
a
patronizing
tone
the
old
collector
could
say
nothing
to
that
either
he
was
looking
at
the
vacant
spots
which
many
small
pictures
had
left
on
the
walls
paintings
by
famous
masters
of
the
xviii
century
the
banded
brigand
must
also
have
passed
these
by
as
too
insignificant
to
carry
off
but
the
smirk
illuminating
the
count
s
face
revealed
their
ultimate
destination
he
had
carefully
scrutinized
the
entire
apartment
the
adjoining
bedroom
chichi
s
the
bathroom
even
the
feminine
of
the
family
which
still
contained
some
of
the
daughter
s
gowns
the
warrior
fondled
with
delight
the
fine
silky
folds
of
the
materials
gloating
over
their
cool
softness
this
contact
made
him
think
of
paris
of
the
fashions
of
the
establishments
of
the
great
modistes
the
rue
de
la
paix
was
the
spot
which
he
most
admired
in
his
visits
to
the
enemy
s
city
don
marcelo
noticed
the
strong
mixture
of
perfumes
which
came
from
his
hair
his
moustache
his
entire
body
various
little
jars
from
the
dressing
table
were
on
the
mantel
what
a
filthy
thing
war
is
exclaimed
the
german
this
morning
i
was
at
last
able
to
take
a
bath
after
a
week
s
abstinence
at
noon
i
shall
take
another
by
the
way
my
dear
sir
these
perfumes
are
good
but
they
are
not
elegant
when
i
have
the
pleasure
of
being
presented
to
the
ladies
i
shall
give
them
the
addresses
of
my
source
of
supply
i
use
in
my
home
essences
from
turkey
i
have
many
friends
there
at
the
close
of
the
war
i
will
send
a
consignment
to
the
while
speaking
the
count
s
eyes
had
been
fixed
upon
some
photographs
upon
the
table
examining
the
portrait
of
madame
desnoyers
he
guessed
that
she
must
be
dona
luisa
he
smiled
before
the
bewitchingly
mischievous
face
of
mademoiselle
chichi
very
enchanting
he
specially
admired
her
militant
boyish
expression
but
he
scrutinized
the
photograph
of
julio
with
special
interest
splendid
type
of
youth
he
murmured
an
interesting
head
and
artistic
too
he
would
create
a
great
sensation
in
a
ball
what
a
persian
prince
he
would
make
a
white
aigrette
on
his
head
fastened
with
a
great
jewel
the
breast
bared
a
black
tunic
with
golden
birds
and
he
continued
seeing
in
his
mind
s
eye
the
heir
of
the
desnoyers
arrayed
in
all
the
gorgeous
raiment
of
an
oriental
monarch
the
proud
father
because
of
the
interest
which
his
son
was
inspiring
began
to
feel
a
glimmer
of
sympathy
with
the
man
a
pity
that
he
should
select
so
unerringly
and
appropriate
the
choicest
things
in
the
castle
near
the
head
of
the
bed
don
marcelo
saw
lying
upon
a
book
of
devotions
forgotten
by
his
wife
a
medallion
containing
another
photograph
it
did
not
belong
to
his
family
and
the
count
following
the
direction
of
his
eyes
wished
to
show
it
to
him
the
hands
of
this
son
of
mars
trembled
his
disdainful
haughtiness
had
suddenly
disappeared
an
official
of
the
hussars
of
death
was
smiling
from
the
case
his
sharp
profile
with
a
beak
curved
like
a
bird
of
prey
was
surmounted
by
a
cap
adorned
with
skull
and
my
best
friend
said
the
count
in
tremulous
tones
the
being
that
i
love
most
in
all
the
world
and
to
think
that
at
this
moment
he
may
be
fighting
and
they
may
kill
him
to
think
that
i
too
may
die
desnoyers
believed
that
he
must
be
getting
a
glimpse
into
a
romance
of
the
nobleman
s
past
that
hussar
was
undoubtedly
his
natural
son
his
simplicity
of
mind
could
not
conceive
of
anything
else
only
a
father
s
tenderness
could
so
express
itself
and
he
was
almost
touched
by
this
tenderness
here
the
interview
came
to
an
end
the
warrior
turning
his
back
as
he
left
the
room
in
order
to
hide
his
emotion
a
few
minutes
after
was
heard
on
the
floor
below
the
sound
of
a
grand
piano
which
the
commissary
had
not
been
able
to
carry
off
owing
to
the
general
s
interposition
his
voice
was
soon
heard
above
the
chords
that
he
was
playing
it
was
rather
a
lifeless
baritone
but
he
managed
to
impart
an
impassioned
tremolo
to
his
romance
the
listening
old
man
was
now
really
affected
he
did
not
understand
the
words
but
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
he
thought
of
his
family
of
the
sorrows
and
dangers
about
them
and
of
the
difficulties
surrounding
his
return
to
them
as
though
under
the
spell
of
the
melody
little
by
little
he
descended
the
stairs
what
an
artist
s
soul
that
haughty
scoffer
had
at
first
sight
the
germans
with
their
rough
exterior
and
their
discipline
which
made
them
commit
the
greatest
atrocities
gave
one
a
wrong
impression
one
had
to
live
intimately
with
them
to
appreciate
their
true
worth
by
the
time
the
music
had
ceased
he
had
reached
the
castle
bridge
a
was
watching
the
graceful
movements
of
the
swans
gliding
double
over
the
waters
of
the
moat
he
was
a
young
doctor
of
laws
who
just
now
was
serving
as
secretary
to
his
excellency
a
university
man
mobilized
by
the
war
on
speaking
with
don
marcelo
he
immediately
revealed
his
academic
training
the
order
for
departure
had
surprised
the
professor
in
a
private
institute
he
was
just
about
to
be
married
and
all
his
plans
had
been
upset
what
a
calamity
sir
what
an
overturning
for
the
world
yet
many
of
us
have
foreseen
that
this
catastrophe
simply
had
to
come
we
have
felt
strongly
that
it
might
break
out
any
day
capital
accursed
capital
is
to
the
speaker
was
a
socialist
he
did
not
hesitate
to
admit
his
in
certain
acts
of
his
party
that
had
brought
persecutions
and
to
his
career
but
the
was
now
being
accepted
by
the
emperor
and
flattered
by
the
most
reactionary
junkers
all
were
now
one
the
deputies
of
his
party
were
forming
in
the
reichstag
the
group
most
obedient
to
the
government
the
only
belief
that
it
retained
from
its
former
creed
was
its
anathematization
of
capital
responsible
for
the
war
desnoyers
ventured
to
disagree
with
this
enemy
who
appeared
of
an
amiable
and
tolerant
character
did
he
not
think
that
the
real
responsibility
rested
with
german
militarism
had
it
not
sought
and
prepared
this
conflict
by
its
arrogance
preventing
any
settlement
the
socialist
denied
this
roundly
his
deputies
were
supporting
the
war
and
therefore
must
have
good
reason
everything
that
he
said
showed
an
absolute
submission
to
discipline
the
eternal
german
discipline
blind
and
obedient
which
was
dominating
even
the
most
advanced
parties
in
vain
the
frenchman
repeated
arguments
and
facts
which
everybody
had
read
from
the
beginning
of
the
war
his
words
simply
slid
over
the
calloused
brains
of
this
revolutionist
accustomed
to
delegating
all
his
reasoning
functions
to
others
who
can
tell
he
finally
said
perhaps
we
have
made
a
mistake
but
just
at
this
moment
all
is
confused
the
premises
which
would
enable
us
to
draw
exact
conclusions
are
lacking
when
the
conflict
ends
we
shall
know
the
truly
guilty
parties
and
if
they
are
ours
we
shall
throw
the
responsibility
upon
desnoyers
could
hardly
keep
from
laughing
at
his
simplicity
to
wait
till
the
end
of
the
war
to
know
who
was
to
blame
and
if
the
empire
should
come
out
conqueror
what
responsibility
could
the
socialists
exact
in
the
full
pride
of
victory
they
who
always
confined
themselves
to
electoral
battles
without
the
slightest
attempt
at
rebellion
whatever
the
cause
may
be
concluded
the
socialist
this
war
is
very
sad
how
many
dead
i
was
at
charleroi
one
has
to
see
modern
warfare
close
by
we
shall
conquer
we
are
going
to
enter
paris
so
they
say
but
many
of
our
men
must
fall
before
obtaining
the
final
and
as
though
wishing
to
put
these
visions
of
death
out
of
his
mind
he
resumed
his
diversion
of
watching
the
swans
offering
them
bits
of
bread
so
as
to
make
them
swing
around
in
their
slow
and
majestic
course
the
keeper
and
his
family
were
continually
crossing
and
recrossing
the
bridge
seeing
their
master
on
such
friendly
terms
with
the
invaders
they
had
lost
some
of
the
fear
which
had
kept
them
shut
up
in
their
cottage
to
the
woman
it
seemed
but
natural
that
don
marcelo
s
authority
should
be
recognized
by
these
people
the
master
is
always
the
master
and
as
though
she
had
received
a
part
of
this
authority
she
was
entering
the
castle
fearlessly
followed
by
her
daughter
in
order
to
put
in
order
her
master
s
sleeping
room
they
had
decided
to
pass
the
night
in
rooms
near
his
that
he
might
not
feel
so
lonely
among
the
germans
the
two
women
were
carrying
bedding
and
mattresses
from
the
lodge
to
the
top
floor
the
keeper
was
occupied
in
heating
a
second
bath
for
his
excellency
while
his
wife
was
bemoaning
with
gestures
of
despair
the
sacking
of
the
castle
how
many
exquisite
things
had
disappeared
desirous
of
saving
the
remainder
she
besought
her
master
to
make
complaints
as
though
he
could
prevent
the
individual
and
stealthy
robberies
the
orderlies
and
followers
of
the
count
were
pocketing
everything
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
saying
smilingly
that
they
were
souvenirs
later
on
the
woman
approached
desnoyers
with
a
mysterious
air
to
impart
a
new
revelation
she
had
seen
a
head
officer
force
open
the
chiffoniers
where
her
mistress
was
accustomed
to
keep
her
lingerie
and
he
was
making
up
a
package
of
the
finest
pieces
including
a
great
quantity
of
blonde
lace
that
s
the
one
master
she
said
soon
after
pointing
to
a
german
who
was
writing
in
the
garden
where
an
oblique
ray
of
sunlight
was
filtering
through
the
branches
upon
his
table
don
marcelo
recognized
him
with
surprise
commandant
blumhardt
too
but
immediately
he
excused
the
act
he
supposed
it
was
only
natural
that
this
official
should
want
to
take
something
away
from
the
castle
since
the
count
had
set
the
example
besides
he
took
into
account
the
quality
of
the
objects
which
he
was
appropriating
they
were
not
for
himself
they
were
for
the
wife
for
the
daughters
a
good
father
of
his
family
for
more
than
an
hour
now
he
had
been
sitting
before
that
table
writing
incessantly
conversing
pen
in
hand
with
his
augusta
and
all
the
family
in
cassel
better
that
this
good
man
should
carry
off
his
stuff
than
those
other
domineering
officers
with
cutting
voices
and
insolent
stiffness
desnoyers
noticed
too
that
the
writer
raised
his
head
every
time
that
georgette
the
warden
s
daughter
passed
by
following
her
with
his
eyes
the
poor
father
undoubtedly
he
was
comparing
her
with
his
two
girls
home
in
germany
with
all
their
thoughts
on
the
war
he
too
was
thinking
of
chichi
fearing
sometimes
that
he
might
never
see
her
again
in
one
of
her
trips
from
the
castle
to
her
home
blumhardt
called
the
child
to
him
she
stopped
before
the
table
timid
and
shrinking
as
though
she
felt
a
presentiment
of
danger
but
making
an
effort
to
smile
the
prussian
father
meanwhile
chatted
with
her
and
patted
her
cheeks
with
his
great
paws
a
sight
which
touched
desnoyers
deeply
the
memories
of
a
pacific
and
virtuous
life
were
rising
above
the
horrors
of
war
decidedly
this
one
enemy
was
a
good
man
anyway
because
of
his
conclusion
the
millionaire
smiled
indulgently
when
the
commandant
leaving
the
table
came
toward
him
after
delivering
his
letter
and
a
bulky
package
to
a
soldier
to
take
to
the
battalion
in
the
village
it
is
for
my
family
he
explained
i
do
not
let
a
day
pass
without
sending
them
a
letter
theirs
are
so
precious
to
me
i
am
also
sending
them
a
few
desnoyers
was
on
the
point
of
protesting
but
with
a
shrug
of
indifference
he
concluded
to
keep
silence
as
if
he
did
not
object
the
commandant
continued
talking
of
the
sweet
augusta
and
their
children
while
the
invisible
tempest
kept
on
thundering
beyond
the
serene
twilight
horizon
each
time
the
cannonading
was
more
intense
the
battle
continued
blumhardt
always
a
battle
surely
it
is
the
last
and
we
are
going
to
win
within
the
week
we
shall
be
entering
paris
but
how
many
will
never
see
it
so
many
dead
i
understand
that
we
shall
not
be
here
all
the
reserves
are
to
combine
with
the
attack
so
as
to
overcome
the
last
resistance
if
only
i
do
not
fall
thoughts
of
the
possibility
of
death
the
following
day
contracted
his
forehead
in
a
scowl
of
hatred
a
deep
vertical
line
was
parting
his
eyebrows
he
frowned
ferociously
at
desnoyers
as
though
making
him
responsible
for
his
death
and
the
trouble
of
his
family
for
a
few
moments
don
marcelo
could
hardly
recognize
this
man
transformed
by
warlike
passions
as
the
and
friendly
blumhardt
of
a
little
while
before
the
sun
was
beginning
to
set
when
a
the
one
of
the
came
running
in
search
of
the
commandant
desnoyers
could
not
understand
what
was
the
matter
because
they
were
speaking
in
german
but
following
the
direction
of
the
messenger
s
continual
pointing
he
saw
beyond
the
iron
gates
a
group
of
country
people
and
some
soldiers
with
guns
blumhardt
after
a
brief
reflection
started
toward
the
group
and
don
marcelo
behind
him
soon
he
saw
a
village
lad
in
the
charge
of
some
germans
who
were
holding
their
bayonets
to
his
breast
his
face
was
colorless
with
the
whiteness
of
a
wax
candle
his
shirt
blackened
with
soot
was
so
badly
torn
that
it
told
of
a
struggle
on
one
temple
was
a
gash
bleeding
badly
a
short
distance
away
was
a
woman
with
dishevelled
hair
holding
a
baby
and
surrounded
by
four
children
all
covered
with
black
grime
as
though
coming
from
a
coal
mine
the
woman
was
pleading
desperately
raising
her
hands
appealingly
her
sobs
interrupting
her
story
which
she
was
uselessly
trying
to
tell
the
soldiers
incapable
of
understanding
her
the
petty
officer
convoying
the
band
spoke
in
german
with
the
commandant
while
the
woman
besought
the
intervention
of
desnoyers
when
she
recognized
the
owner
of
the
castle
she
suddenly
regained
her
serenity
believing
that
he
could
intercede
for
her
that
husky
young
boy
was
her
son
they
had
all
been
hiding
since
the
day
before
in
the
cellar
of
their
burned
house
hunger
and
the
danger
of
death
from
asphyxiation
had
forced
them
finally
to
venture
forth
as
soon
as
the
germans
had
seen
her
son
they
had
beaten
him
and
were
going
to
shoot
him
as
they
were
shooting
all
the
young
men
they
believed
that
the
lad
was
twenty
years
old
the
age
of
a
soldier
and
in
order
that
he
might
not
join
the
french
army
they
were
going
to
kill
him
it
s
a
lie
shrieked
the
mother
he
is
not
more
than
eighteen
not
eighteen
a
little
less
he
s
only
she
turned
to
those
who
were
following
behind
in
order
to
implore
their
testimony
sad
women
equally
dirty
their
ragged
garments
smelling
of
fire
poverty
and
death
all
assented
adding
their
outcries
to
those
of
the
mother
some
even
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
the
overgrown
boy
was
only
sixteen
fifteen
and
to
this
feminine
chorus
was
added
the
wailing
of
the
little
ones
looking
at
their
brother
with
eyes
distended
with
terror
the
commandant
examined
the
prisoner
while
he
listened
to
the
official
an
employee
of
the
township
had
said
carelessly
that
the
child
was
about
twenty
never
dreaming
that
with
this
inaccuracy
he
was
causing
his
death
it
was
a
lie
repeated
the
mother
guessing
instinctively
what
they
were
saying
that
man
made
a
mistake
my
boy
is
robust
and
therefore
looks
older
than
he
is
but
he
is
not
twenty
the
gentleman
from
the
castle
who
knows
him
can
tell
you
so
is
it
not
so
monsieur
desnoyers
since
in
her
maternal
desperation
she
had
appealed
to
his
protection
don
marcelo
believed
that
he
ought
to
intervene
and
so
he
spoke
to
the
commandant
he
knew
this
youth
very
well
he
did
not
ever
remember
having
seen
him
before
and
believed
that
he
really
was
under
twenty
and
even
if
he
were
of
age
he
added
is
that
a
crime
to
shoot
a
man
for
blumhardt
did
not
reply
since
he
had
recovered
his
functions
of
command
he
ignored
absolutely
don
marcelo
s
existence
he
was
about
to
say
something
to
give
an
order
but
hesitated
it
might
be
better
to
consult
his
excellency
and
seeing
that
he
was
going
toward
the
castle
desnoyers
marched
by
his
side
commandant
this
can
not
be
he
commenced
saying
this
lacks
common
sense
to
shoot
a
man
on
the
suspicion
that
he
may
be
twenty
years
old
but
the
commandant
remained
silent
and
continued
on
his
way
as
they
crossed
the
bridge
they
heard
the
sound
of
the
piano
a
good
omen
desnoyers
thought
the
aesthete
who
had
so
touched
him
with
his
impassioned
voice
was
going
to
say
the
saving
word
on
entering
the
salon
he
did
not
at
first
recognize
his
excellency
he
saw
a
man
sitting
at
the
piano
wearing
no
clothing
but
a
japanese
dressing
gown
a
woman
s
kimono
embroidered
with
golden
birds
belonging
to
chichi
at
any
other
time
he
would
have
burst
into
roars
of
laughter
at
beholding
this
scrawny
bony
warrior
with
the
cruel
eyes
with
his
brawny
braceleted
arms
appearing
through
the
loose
sleeves
after
taking
his
bath
the
count
had
delayed
putting
on
his
uniform
luxuriating
in
the
silky
contact
of
the
feminine
tunic
so
like
his
oriental
garments
in
berlin
blumhardt
did
not
betray
the
slightest
astonishment
at
the
aspect
of
his
general
in
the
customary
attitude
of
military
erectness
he
spoke
in
his
own
language
while
the
count
listened
with
a
bored
air
meanwhile
passing
his
fingers
idly
over
the
keys
a
shaft
of
sunlight
from
a
nearby
window
was
enveloping
the
piano
and
musician
in
a
halo
of
gold
through
the
window
too
was
wafting
the
poetry
of
the
sunset
the
rustling
of
the
leaves
the
hushed
song
of
the
birds
and
the
hum
of
the
insects
whose
transparent
wings
were
glowing
like
sparks
in
the
last
rays
of
the
sun
the
general
annoyed
that
his
dreaming
melancholy
should
be
interrupted
by
this
inopportune
visit
cut
short
the
commandant
s
story
with
a
gesture
of
command
and
a
word
one
word
only
he
said
no
more
he
took
two
puffs
from
a
turkish
cigarette
that
was
slowly
scorching
the
wood
of
the
piano
and
again
ran
his
hands
over
the
ivory
keys
catching
up
the
broken
threads
of
the
vague
and
tender
improvisation
inspired
by
the
gloaming
thanks
your
excellency
said
the
gratified
desnoyers
surmising
his
magnanimous
response
the
commandant
had
disappeared
nor
could
the
frenchman
find
him
outside
the
castle
a
soldier
was
pacing
up
and
down
near
the
iron
gates
in
order
to
transmit
commands
and
the
guards
were
pushing
back
with
blows
from
their
guns
a
screaming
group
of
women
and
tiny
children
the
entrance
was
entirely
cleared
undoubtedly
the
crowds
were
returning
to
the
village
after
the
general
s
pardon
desnoyers
was
half
way
down
the
avenue
when
he
heard
a
howling
sound
composed
of
many
voices
a
shriek
such
as
only
womanly
desperation
can
send
forth
at
the
same
time
the
air
was
vibrating
with
snaps
the
loud
cracking
sound
that
he
knew
from
the
day
before
shots
he
imagined
that
on
the
other
side
of
the
iron
railing
there
were
some
writhing
bodies
struggling
to
escape
from
powerful
arms
and
others
fleeing
with
bounds
of
fear
he
saw
running
toward
him
a
sobbing
woman
with
her
hands
to
her
head
it
was
the
wife
of
the
keeper
who
a
little
while
before
had
joined
the
desperate
group
of
women
oh
don
t
go
on
master
she
called
stopping
his
hurried
step
they
have
killed
him
they
have
just
shot
don
marcelo
stood
rooted
to
the
ground
shot
and
after
the
general
s
pardon
suddenly
he
ran
back
to
the
castle
hardly
knowing
what
he
was
doing
and
soon
reached
the
salon
his
excellency
was
still
at
the
piano
humming
in
low
tones
his
eyes
moistened
by
the
poesy
of
his
dreams
but
the
breathless
old
gentleman
did
not
stop
to
listen
they
have
shot
him
your
excellency
they
have
just
killed
him
in
spite
of
your
the
smile
which
crossed
the
count
s
face
immediately
informed
him
of
his
mistake
that
is
war
my
dear
sir
said
the
player
pausing
for
a
moment
war
with
its
cruel
necessities
it
is
always
expedient
to
destroy
the
enemy
of
and
with
a
pedantic
air
as
though
he
were
giving
a
lesson
he
discoursed
about
the
orientals
great
masters
of
the
art
of
living
one
of
the
personages
most
admired
by
him
was
a
certain
sultan
of
the
turkish
conquest
who
with
his
own
hands
had
strangled
the
sons
of
the
adversary
our
foes
do
not
come
into
the
world
on
horseback
and
brandishing
the
lance
said
that
hero
all
are
born
as
children
and
it
is
advisable
to
wipe
them
from
the
face
of
the
earth
before
they
grow
desnoyers
listened
without
taking
it
in
one
thought
only
was
occupying
his
mind
that
man
that
he
had
supposed
just
that
sentimentalist
so
affected
by
his
own
singing
had
between
two
arpeggios
coldly
given
the
order
for
death
the
count
made
a
gesture
of
impatience
he
might
retire
now
and
he
counselled
him
to
be
more
discreet
in
the
future
avoiding
mixing
himself
up
in
the
affairs
of
the
service
then
he
turned
his
back
running
his
hands
over
the
piano
and
giving
himself
up
to
harmonious
melancholy
for
don
marcelo
there
now
began
an
absurd
life
of
the
most
extraordinary
events
an
experience
which
was
going
to
last
four
days
in
his
life
history
this
period
represented
a
long
parenthesis
of
stupefaction
slashed
by
the
most
horrible
visions
not
wishing
to
meet
these
men
again
he
abandoned
his
own
bedroom
taking
refuge
on
the
top
floor
in
the
servants
quarters
near
the
room
selected
by
the
warden
and
his
family
in
vain
the
good
woman
kept
offering
him
things
to
eat
as
the
night
came
on
he
had
no
appetite
he
lay
stretched
out
on
the
bed
preferring
to
be
alone
with
his
thoughts
in
the
dark
when
would
this
martyrdom
ever
come
to
an
end
there
came
into
his
mind
the
recollection
of
a
trip
which
he
had
made
to
london
some
years
ago
in
his
imagination
he
again
saw
the
british
museum
and
certain
assyrian
relics
of
bestial
humanity
which
had
filled
him
with
terror
the
warriors
were
represented
as
burning
the
towns
the
prisoners
were
beheaded
in
heaps
the
pacific
countrymen
were
marching
in
lines
with
chains
on
their
necks
forming
strings
of
slaves
until
that
moment
he
had
never
realized
the
advance
which
civilization
had
made
through
the
centuries
wars
were
still
breaking
out
now
and
then
but
they
had
been
regulated
by
the
march
of
progress
the
life
of
the
prisoner
was
now
held
sacred
the
captured
towns
must
be
respected
there
existed
a
complete
code
of
international
law
to
regulate
how
men
should
be
killed
and
nations
should
combat
causing
the
least
possible
harm
but
now
he
had
just
seen
the
primitive
realities
of
war
the
same
as
that
of
thousands
of
years
ago
the
men
with
the
helmets
were
proceeding
in
exactly
the
same
way
as
those
ferocious
and
perfumed
satraps
with
blue
mitre
and
curled
beard
the
adversary
was
shot
although
not
carrying
arms
the
prisoner
died
of
shot
or
blow
from
the
gun
the
civilian
captives
were
sent
in
crowds
to
germany
like
those
of
other
centuries
of
what
avail
was
all
our
progress
where
was
our
boasted
civilization
he
was
awakened
by
the
light
of
a
candle
in
his
eyes
the
warden
s
wife
had
come
up
again
to
see
if
he
needed
anything
oh
what
a
night
master
just
hear
them
yelling
and
singing
the
bottles
that
they
have
emptied
they
are
in
the
dining
room
you
better
not
see
them
now
they
are
amusing
themselves
by
breaking
the
furniture
even
the
count
is
drunk
drunk
too
is
that
commandant
that
you
were
talking
with
and
all
the
rest
some
of
them
are
dancing
she
evidently
wished
to
keep
quiet
about
certain
details
but
her
love
of
talking
got
the
better
of
her
discretion
some
of
the
officers
had
dressed
themselves
up
in
the
hats
and
gowns
of
her
mistress
and
were
dancing
and
shouting
imitating
feminine
seductiveness
and
affectations
one
of
them
had
been
greeted
with
roars
of
enthusiasm
upon
presenting
himself
with
no
other
clothing
than
a
combination
of
mademoiselle
chichi
s
many
were
taking
obscene
delight
in
soiling
the
rugs
and
filling
the
sideboard
drawers
with
indescribable
filth
using
the
finest
linens
that
they
could
lay
their
hands
on
her
master
silenced
her
peremptorily
why
tell
him
such
vile
disgusting
things
and
we
are
obliged
to
wait
on
them
wailed
the
woman
they
are
beside
themselves
they
appear
like
different
beings
the
soldiers
are
saying
that
they
are
going
to
resume
their
march
at
daybreak
there
is
a
great
battle
on
and
they
are
going
to
win
it
but
it
is
necessary
that
everyone
of
them
should
fight
in
it
my
poor
sick
husband
just
can
t
stand
it
any
longer
so
many
humiliations
and
my
little
girl
my
little
girl
the
child
was
her
greatest
anxiety
she
had
her
well
hidden
away
but
she
was
watching
uneasily
the
goings
and
comings
of
some
of
these
men
maddened
with
alcohol
the
most
terrible
of
them
all
was
that
fat
officer
who
had
patted
georgette
so
paternally
apprehension
for
her
daughter
s
safety
made
her
hurry
restlessly
away
saying
over
and
over
god
has
forgotten
the
world
ay
what
is
ever
going
to
become
of
us
don
marcelo
was
now
tinglingly
awake
through
the
open
window
was
blowing
the
clear
night
air
the
cannonading
was
still
going
on
prolonging
the
conflict
way
into
the
night
below
the
castle
the
soldiers
were
intoning
a
slow
and
melodious
chant
that
sounded
like
a
psalm
from
the
interior
of
the
edifice
rose
the
whoopings
of
brutal
laughter
the
crash
of
breaking
furniture
and
the
mad
chase
of
dissolute
pursuit
when
would
this
diabolical
orgy
ever
wear
itself
down
for
a
long
time
he
was
not
at
all
sleepy
but
was
gradually
losing
consciousness
of
what
was
going
on
around
him
when
he
was
roused
with
a
start
near
him
on
the
same
floor
a
door
had
fallen
with
a
crash
unable
to
resist
a
succession
of
formidable
batterings
this
was
followed
immediately
by
the
screams
of
a
woman
weeping
desperate
supplications
the
noise
of
a
struggle
reeling
steps
and
the
thud
of
bodies
against
the
wall
he
had
a
presentiment
that
it
was
georgette
shrieking
and
trying
to
defend
herself
before
he
could
put
his
feet
to
the
floor
he
heard
a
man
s
voice
which
he
was
sure
was
the
keeper
s
she
was
safe
ah
you
villain
then
the
outbreak
of
a
second
struggle
a
shot
silence
rushing
down
the
hallway
that
ended
at
the
stairway
desnoyers
saw
lights
and
many
men
who
came
trooping
up
the
stairs
bounding
over
several
steps
at
a
time
he
almost
fell
over
a
body
from
which
escaped
a
groan
of
agony
at
his
feet
lay
the
warden
his
chest
moving
like
a
pair
of
bellows
his
eyes
glassy
and
unnaturally
distended
his
mouth
covered
with
blood
near
him
glistened
a
kitchen
knife
then
he
saw
a
man
with
a
revolver
in
one
hand
and
holding
shut
with
the
other
a
broken
door
that
someone
was
trying
to
open
from
within
don
marcelo
recognized
him
in
spite
of
his
greenish
pallor
and
wild
look
it
was
blumhardt
another
blumhardt
with
a
bestial
expression
of
terrifying
ferocity
and
lust
don
marcelo
could
see
clearly
how
it
had
all
happened
the
debauchee
rushing
through
the
castle
in
search
of
his
prey
the
anxious
father
in
close
pursuit
the
cries
of
the
girl
the
unequal
struggle
between
the
consumptive
with
his
emergency
weapon
and
the
warrior
triumphant
the
fury
of
his
youth
awoke
in
the
old
frenchman
sweeping
everything
before
it
what
did
it
matter
if
he
did
die
ah
you
villain
he
yelled
as
the
poor
father
had
done
and
with
clenched
fists
he
marched
up
to
the
german
who
smiled
coldly
and
held
his
revolver
to
his
eyes
he
was
just
going
to
shoot
him
but
at
that
instant
desnoyers
fell
to
the
floor
knocked
down
by
those
who
were
leaping
up
the
stairs
he
received
many
blows
the
heavy
boots
of
the
invaders
hammering
him
with
their
heels
he
felt
a
hot
stream
pouring
over
his
face
blood
he
did
not
know
whether
it
was
his
own
or
that
of
the
palpitating
mortal
slowly
dying
beside
him
then
he
found
himself
lifted
from
the
floor
by
many
hands
which
pushed
him
toward
a
man
it
was
his
excellency
with
his
uniform
burst
open
and
smelling
of
wine
eyes
and
voice
were
both
trembling
my
dear
sir
he
stuttered
trying
to
recover
this
suave
irony
i
warned
you
not
to
interfere
in
our
affairs
and
you
have
not
obeyed
me
you
may
now
take
the
consequences
of
your
lack
of
he
gave
an
order
and
the
old
man
felt
himself
pushed
downstairs
to
the
cellars
underneath
the
castle
those
conducting
him
were
soldiers
under
the
command
of
a
petty
officer
whom
he
recognized
as
the
socialist
this
young
professor
was
the
only
one
sober
but
he
maintained
himself
erect
and
unapproachable
with
the
ferocity
of
discipline
he
put
his
prisoner
into
an
arched
vault
without
any
except
a
tiny
window
on
a
level
with
the
floor
many
broken
bottles
and
chests
with
some
straw
were
all
that
was
in
the
cave
you
have
insulted
a
head
officer
said
the
official
roughly
and
they
will
probably
shoot
you
your
only
salvation
lies
in
the
continuance
of
the
revels
in
which
case
they
may
forget
as
the
door
of
this
was
broken
like
all
the
others
in
the
building
a
pile
of
boxes
and
furniture
was
heaped
in
the
entrance
way
don
marcelo
passed
the
rest
of
the
night
tormented
with
the
cold
the
only
thing
which
worried
him
just
then
he
had
abandoned
all
hope
of
life
even
the
images
of
his
family
seemed
blotted
from
his
memory
he
worked
in
the
dark
in
order
to
make
himself
more
comfortable
on
the
chests
burrowing
down
into
the
straw
for
the
sake
of
its
heat
when
the
morning
breeze
began
to
sift
in
through
the
little
window
he
fell
slowly
into
a
heavy
overpowering
sleep
like
that
of
criminals
condemned
to
death
or
duellists
before
the
fatal
morning
he
thought
he
heard
shouts
in
german
the
galloping
of
horses
a
distant
sound
of
tattoo
and
whistle
such
as
the
battalions
of
the
invaders
made
with
their
fifes
and
drums
then
he
lost
all
consciousness
of
his
surroundings
on
opening
his
eyes
again
a
ray
of
sunlight
slipping
through
the
window
was
tracing
a
little
golden
square
on
the
wall
giving
a
regal
splendor
to
the
hanging
cobwebs
somebody
was
removing
the
barricade
before
the
door
a
woman
s
voice
timid
and
distressed
was
calling
repeatedly
master
are
you
here
he
sprang
up
quickly
wishing
to
aid
the
worker
outside
and
pushing
vigorously
he
thought
that
the
invaders
must
have
left
in
no
other
way
could
he
imagine
the
warden
s
wife
daring
to
try
to
get
him
out
of
his
cell
yes
they
have
gone
she
said
nobody
is
left
in
the
as
soon
as
he
was
able
to
get
out
don
marcelo
looked
inquiringly
at
the
woman
with
her
bloodshot
eyes
dishevelled
hair
and
face
the
night
had
weighed
her
down
pitilessly
with
the
pressure
of
many
years
all
the
energy
with
which
she
had
been
working
to
free
desnoyers
disappeared
on
seeing
him
again
oh
master
master
she
moaned
convulsively
and
she
flung
herself
into
his
arms
bursting
into
tears
don
marcelo
did
not
need
to
ask
anything
further
he
dreaded
to
know
the
truth
nevertheless
he
asked
after
her
husband
now
that
he
was
awake
and
free
he
cherished
the
fleeting
hope
that
what
he
had
gone
through
the
night
before
was
but
another
of
his
nightmares
perhaps
the
poor
man
was
still
living
they
killed
him
monsieur
that
man
who
seemed
so
good
murdered
him
and
i
don
t
know
where
his
body
is
nobody
will
tell
she
had
a
suspicion
that
the
corpse
was
in
the
fosse
the
green
and
tranquil
waters
had
closed
mysteriously
over
this
victim
of
the
night
desnoyers
suspected
that
another
sorrow
was
troubling
the
mother
still
more
but
he
kept
modestly
silent
it
was
she
who
finally
spoke
between
outbursts
of
grief
georgette
was
now
in
the
lodge
and
shuddering
she
had
fled
there
when
the
invaders
had
left
the
castle
they
had
kept
her
in
their
power
until
the
last
minute
oh
master
don
t
look
at
her
she
is
trembling
and
sobbing
at
the
thought
that
you
may
speak
with
her
about
what
she
has
gone
through
she
is
almost
out
of
her
mind
she
longs
to
die
ay
my
little
girl
and
is
there
no
one
who
will
punish
these
monsters
they
had
come
up
from
the
cellars
and
crossed
the
bridge
the
woman
looking
fixedly
into
the
silent
waters
the
dead
body
of
a
swan
was
floating
upon
them
before
their
departure
while
their
horses
were
being
saddled
two
officers
had
amused
themselves
by
chasing
with
revolver
shots
the
birds
swimming
in
the
moat
the
aquatic
plants
were
spotted
with
blood
among
the
leaves
were
floating
some
tufts
of
limp
white
plumage
like
a
bit
of
washing
escaped
from
the
hands
of
a
laundress
don
marcelo
and
the
woman
exchanged
a
compassionate
glance
and
then
looked
pityingly
at
each
other
as
the
sunlight
brought
out
more
strongly
their
aging
wan
appearance
the
passing
of
these
people
had
destroyed
everything
there
was
no
food
left
in
the
castle
except
some
crusts
of
dry
bread
forgotten
in
the
kitchen
and
we
have
to
live
monsieur
exclaimed
the
woman
with
reviving
energy
as
she
thought
of
her
daughter
s
need
we
have
to
live
if
only
to
see
how
god
punishes
them
the
old
man
shrugged
his
shoulders
in
despair
god
but
the
woman
was
right
they
had
to
live
with
the
famished
audacity
of
his
early
youth
when
he
was
travelling
over
boundless
tracts
of
land
driving
his
herds
of
cattle
he
now
rushed
outside
the
park
hunting
for
some
form
of
sustenance
he
saw
the
valley
fair
and
green
basking
in
the
sun
the
groups
of
trees
the
plots
of
yellowish
soil
with
the
hard
spikes
of
stubble
the
hedges
in
which
the
birds
were
singing
all
the
summer
splendor
of
a
countryside
developed
and
cultivated
during
fifteen
centuries
by
dozens
and
dozens
of
generations
and
yet
here
he
was
alone
at
the
mercy
of
chance
likely
to
perish
with
hunger
more
alone
than
when
he
was
crossing
the
towering
heights
of
the
andes
those
irregular
slopes
of
rocks
and
snow
wrapped
in
endless
silence
only
broken
from
time
to
time
by
the
flapping
of
the
condor
s
wings
nobody
his
gaze
could
not
distinguish
a
single
movable
point
everything
fixed
motionless
crystallized
as
though
contracted
with
fear
before
the
peals
of
thunder
which
were
still
rumbling
around
the
horizon
he
went
on
toward
the
village
a
mass
of
black
walls
with
a
few
houses
still
intact
and
a
roofless
bell
tower
with
its
cross
twisted
by
fire
nobody
in
the
streets
sown
with
bottles
charred
chunks
of
wood
and
rubbish
the
dead
bodies
had
disappeared
but
a
nauseating
smell
of
decomposing
and
burned
flesh
assailed
his
nostrils
he
saw
a
mound
of
earth
where
the
shooting
had
taken
place
and
from
it
were
protruding
two
feet
and
a
hand
at
his
approach
several
black
forms
flew
up
into
the
air
from
a
trench
so
shallow
that
the
bodies
within
were
exposed
to
view
a
whirring
of
stiff
wings
beat
the
air
above
him
flying
off
with
the
croakings
of
wrath
he
explored
every
nook
and
corner
even
approaching
the
place
where
the
troopers
had
erected
their
barricade
the
carts
were
still
by
the
roadside
he
then
retraced
his
steps
calling
out
before
the
least
injured
houses
and
putting
his
head
through
the
doors
and
windows
that
were
unobstructed
or
but
half
consumed
was
nobody
left
in
villeblanche
he
descried
among
the
ruins
something
advancing
on
all
fours
a
species
of
reptile
that
stopped
its
crawling
with
movements
of
hesitation
and
fear
ready
to
retreat
or
slip
into
its
hole
under
the
ruins
suddenly
the
creature
stopped
and
stood
up
it
was
a
man
an
old
man
other
human
larvae
were
coming
forth
conjured
by
his
shouts
poor
beings
who
hours
ago
had
given
up
the
standing
position
which
would
have
attracted
the
bullets
of
the
enemy
and
had
been
enviously
imitating
the
lower
organisms
squirming
through
the
dirt
as
fast
as
they
could
scurry
into
the
bosom
of
the
earth
they
were
mostly
women
and
children
all
filthy
and
black
with
snarled
hair
the
fierceness
of
animal
appetite
in
their
eyes
the
faintness
of
the
weak
animal
in
their
hanging
jaws
they
were
all
living
hidden
in
the
ruins
of
their
homes
fear
had
made
them
temporarily
forget
their
hunger
but
finding
that
the
enemy
had
gone
they
were
suddenly
assailed
by
all
necessitous
demands
intensified
by
hours
of
anguish
desnoyers
felt
as
though
he
were
surrounded
by
a
tribe
of
brutalized
and
famished
indians
like
those
he
had
often
seen
in
his
adventurous
voyages
he
had
brought
with
him
from
paris
a
quantity
of
gold
pieces
and
he
pulled
out
a
coin
which
glittered
in
the
sun
bread
was
needed
everything
eatable
was
needed
he
would
pay
without
haggling
the
flash
of
gold
aroused
looks
of
enthusiasm
and
greediness
but
this
impression
was
all
eyes
contemplating
the
yellow
discs
with
indifference
don
marcelo
was
himself
convinced
that
the
miraculous
charm
had
lost
its
power
they
all
chanted
a
chorus
of
sorrow
and
horrors
with
slow
and
plaintive
voice
as
though
they
stood
weeping
before
a
bier

one

was
lamenting
something
worse
than

my
girl
my
poor
girl
her
look
of
hatred
and
wild
desperation
revealed
the
secret
tragedy
her
outcries
and
tears
recalled
that
other

who
was
sobbing
in
the

way
up
at
the
castle
in
the
depths
of
some
cave
was
lying
the
victim
with
fatigue
shaken
with
a
wild
delirium
in
which
she
still
saw
the
succession
of
brutal
faces
inflamed
with
simian
passion
the
miserable
group
forming
themselves
into
a
circle
around
him
stretched
out
their
hands
beseechingly
toward
the
man
whom
they
knew
to
be

showed
him

implored
as

gave

had
in
his
hand
and
distributed
more
to
the
others
they
took
them
without
looking
at
them
and
continued
their
lament

he
had
gone

on

forming

completely
filling
the

they
were
all
going
in

a

the

were

and

as

they
also
imitated
their
freezing

repellent

there
came
out
of
the

hundreds
of
folding
cots
which
were
placed
in

in
the
different
rooms
the
furniture
that
still
remained
was
thrown
out
in
a
heap
under
the
trees
squads
of
soldiers
were
obeying
with
mechanical
promptitude
the
brief
and
imperious
orders
an
odor
of
an
apothecary
shop
of

now
pervaded
the
quarters
mixed
with
the
strong
smell
of
the
antiseptics
with
which
they
were
sprinkling
the

in

to
disinfect
the

with

this

filled

entire

the

were
carrying

carrying

wrapped
in

which

recognized

were

the

was
soon
converted
into

cemetery
no

was
the

retreat
large
enough
to
hold

now
they
were
bringing
them
down
by
the

dumping
them
in
like
the
rubbish
from

demolished
building
don
marcelo
felt
an
abnormal
delight
in
contemplating
this
increasing
number
of
vanquished
enemies
yet
he
grieved
at
the
same
time
that
this
precipitation
of
intruders
should
be
deposited
forever
on
his
property
at
nightfall
overwhelmed
by
so
many
emotions
he
again
suffered
the
torments
of
hunger
all
day
long
he
had
eaten
nothing
but
the
crust
of
bread
found
in
the
kitchen
by
the
warden
s
wife
the
rest
he
had
left
for
her
and
her
daughter
a
distress
as
harrowing
to
him
as
his
hunger
was
the
sight
of
poor
georgette
s
shocked
despondency
she
was
always
trying
to
escape
from
his
presence
in
an
agony
of
shame
don
t
let
the
master
see
me
she
would
cry
hiding
her
face
since
his
presence
seemed
to
recall
more
vividly
the
memory
of
her
assaults
desnoyers
tried
while
in
the
lodge
to
avoid
going
near
her
desperate
with
the
gnawings
of
his
empty
stomach
he
accosted
several
doctors
who
were
speaking
french
but
all
in
vain
they
would
not
listen
to
him
and
when
he
repeated
his
petitions
they
pushed
him
roughly
out
of
their
way
he
was
not
going
to
perish
with
hunger
in
the
midst
of
his
riches
those
people
were
eating
the
indifferent
nurses
had
established
themselves
in
his
kitchen
but
the
time
passed
on
without
encountering
anybody
who
would
take
pity
on
this
old
man
dragging
himself
weakly
from
one
place
to
another
in
the
misery
of
an
old
age
intensified
by
despair
and
suffering
in
every
part
of
the
body
the
results
of
the
blows
of
the
night
before
he
now
knew
the
gnawings
of
a
hunger
far
worse
than
that
which
he
had
suffered
when
journeying
over
the
desert
plains
a
hunger
among
men
in
a
civilized
country
wearing
a
belt
filled
with
gold
surrounded
with
towers
and
castle
halls
which
were
his
but
in
the
control
of
others
who
would
not
condescend
to
listen
to
him
and
for
this
piteous
ending
of
his
life
he
had
amassed
millions
and
returned
to
europe
ah
the
irony
of
fate
he
saw
a
doctor
s
assistant
leaning
up
against
a
tree
about
to
devour
a
slab
of
bread
and
sausage
his
envious
eyes
scrutinized
this
fellow
tall
his
jaws
bristling
with
a
great
red
beard
the
trembling
old
man
staggered
up
to
him
begging
for
the
food
by
signs
and
holding
out
a
piece
of
money
the
german
s
eyes
glistened
at
the
sight
of
the
gold
and
a
beatific
smile
stretched
his
mouth
from
ear
to
ear
ya
he
responded
and
grabbing
the
money
he
handed
over
the
food
don
marcelo
commenced
to
swallow
it
with
avidity
never
had
he
so
appreciated
the
sheer
ecstasy
of
eating
as
at
that
instant
in
the
midst
of
his
gardens
converted
into
a
cemetery
before
his
despoiled
castle
where
hundreds
of
human
beings
were
groaning
in
agony
a
grayish
arm
passed
before
his
eyes
it
belonged
to
the
german
who
had
returned
with
two
slices
of
bread
and
a
bit
of
meat
snatched
from
the
kitchen
he
repeated
his
smirking
ya
and
after
his
victim
had
secured
it
by
means
of
another
gold
coin
he
was
able
to
take
it
to
the
two
women
hidden
in
the
cottage
during
the
night
a
night
of
painful
watching
cut
with
visions
of
horror
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
roar
of
the
artillery
was
coming
nearer
it
was
a
scarcely
perceptible
difference
perhaps
the
effect
of
the
silence
of
the
night
which
always
intensifies
sound
the
ambulances
continued
coming
from
the
front
discharging
their
cargoes
of
riddled
humanity
and
going
back
for
more
desnoyers
surmised
that
his
castle
was
but
one
of
the
many
hospitals
established
in
a
line
of
more
than
eighty
miles
and
that
on
the
other
side
behind
the
french
were
many
similar
ones
in
which
the
same
activity
was
going
on
the
consignments
of
dying
men
succeeding
each
other
with
terrifying
frequency
many
of
the
combatants
were
not
even
having
the
satisfaction
of
being
taken
from
the
battle
field
but
were
lying
groaning
on
the
ground
burying
their
bleeding
members
in
the
dust
or
mud
and
weltering
in
the
ooze
from
their
wounds
and
don
marcelo
who
a
few
hours
before
had
been
considering
himself
the
unhappiest
of
mortals
now
experienced
a
cruel
joy
in
reflecting
that
so
many
thousands
of
vigorous
men
at
the
point
of
death
could
well
envy
him
for
his
hale
old
age
and
for
the
tranquillity
with
which
he
was
reposing
on
that
humble
bed
the
next
morning
the
orderly
was
waiting
for
him
in
the
same
place
holding
out
a
napkin
filled
with
eatables
good
man
helpful
and
kind
and
he
offered
him
the
piece
of
gold
nein
replied
the
fellow
with
a
broad
malicious
grin
two
gleaming
gold
pieces
appeared
between
don
marcelo
s
fingers
another
leering
nein
and
a
shake
of
the
head
ah
the
robber
how
he
was
taking
advantage
of
his
necessity
and
not
until
he
had
produced
five
gold
coins
was
he
able
to
secure
the
package
he
soon
began
to
notice
all
around
him
a
silent
and
sly
conspiracy
to
get
possession
of
his
money
a
giant
in
a
sergeant
s
uniform
put
a
shovel
in
his
hand
pushing
him
roughly
forward
he
soon
found
himself
in
a
corner
of
the
park
that
had
been
transformed
into
a
graveyard
near
the
cart
of
cadavers
there
he
had
to
shovel
dirt
on
his
own
ground
in
company
with
the
indignant
prisoners
he
averted
his
eyes
so
as
not
to
look
at
the
rigid
and
grotesque
bodies
piled
above
him
at
the
edge
of
the
pit
ready
to
be
tumbled
in
the
ground
was
sending
forth
an
insufferable
odor
for
decomposition
had
already
set
in
in
the
nearby
trenches
the
persistence
with
which
his
overseers
accosted
him
and
the
crafty
smile
of
the
sergeant
made
him
see
through
the
scheme
the
must
be
at
the
bottom
of
all
this
putting
his
hand
in
his
pocket
he
dropped
the
shovel
with
a
look
of
interrogation
ya
replied
the
sergeant
after
handing
over
the
required
sum
the
tormented
old
man
was
permitted
to
stop
and
wander
around
at
his
pleasure
he
knew
however
what
was
probably
in
store
for
him
those
men
were
going
to
submit
him
to
a
merciless
exploitation
another
day
passed
by
like
its
predecessor
in
the
morning
of
the
following
day
his
perceptions
sharpened
by
apprehension
made
him
conjecture
that
something
extraordinary
had
occurred
the
automobiles
were
arriving
and
departing
with
greater
rapidity
and
there
was
greater
disorder
and
confusion
among
the
executive
force
the
telephone
was
ringing
with
mad
precipitation
and
the
wounded
arrivals
seemed
more
depressed
the
day
before
they
had
been
singing
when
taken
from
the
vehicles
hiding
their
woe
with
laughter
and
bravado
all
talking
of
the
near
victory
and
regretting
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
witness
the
triumphal
entry
into
paris
now
they
were
all
very
silent
with
furrowed
brows
thinking
no
longer
about
what
was
going
on
behind
them
wondering
only
about
their
own
fate
outside
the
park
was
the
buzz
of
the
approaching
throng
which
was
blackening
the
roads
the
invasion
was
beginning
again
but
with
a
refluent
movement
for
hours
at
a
time
great
strings
of
gray
trucks
went
puffing
by
then
regiments
of
infantry
squadrons
rolling
stock
they
were
marching
very
slowly
with
a
deliberation
that
puzzled
desnoyers
who
could
not
make
out
whether
this
recessional
meant
flight
or
change
of
position
the
only
thing
that
gave
him
any
satisfaction
was
the
stupefied
and
downcast
appearance
of
the
soldiers
the
gloomy
sulks
of
the
officers
nobody
was
shouting
they
all
appeared
to
have
forgotten
their
nach
paris
the
greenish
gray
monster
still
had
its
armed
head
stretched
across
the
other
side
of
the
marne
but
its
tail
was
beginning
to
uncoil
with
uneasy
wrigglings
after
night
had
settled
down
the
troops
were
still
continuing
to
fall
back
the
cannonading
was
certainly
coming
nearer
some
of
the
thunderous
claps
sounded
so
close
that
they
made
the
glass
tremble
in
the
windows
a
fugitive
farmer
trying
to
find
refuge
in
the
park
gave
don
marcelo
some
news
the
germans
were
in
full
retreat
they
had
installed
some
of
their
batteries
on
the
banks
of
the
marne
in
order
to
attempt
a
new
resistance
and
the
new
arrival
remained
without
attracting
the
attention
of
the
invaders
who
a
few
days
before
would
have
shot
him
on
the
slightest
suspicion
the
mechanical
workings
of
discipline
were
evidently
out
of
gear
doctors
and
nurses
were
running
from
place
to
place
shouting
orders
and
breaking
out
into
a
volley
of
curses
every
time
a
fresh
ambulance
load
arrived
the
drivers
were
commanded
to
take
their
patients
on
ahead
to
another
hospital
near
the
orders
had
been
received
to
evacuate
the
castle
that
very
night
in
spite
of
this
prohibition
one
of
the
ambulances
unloaded
its
relay
of
wounded
men
so
deplorable
was
their
state
that
the
doctors
accepted
them
judging
it
useless
for
them
to
continue
their
journey
they
remained
in
the
garden
lying
on
the
same
stretchers
that
they
had
occupied
within
the
vehicle
by
the
light
of
the
lanterns
desnoyers
recognized
one
of
the
dying
it
was
the
secretary
to
his
excellency
the
socialist
professor
who
had
shut
him
in
the
cellar
vaults
at
the
sight
of
the
owner
of
the
castle
he
smiled
as
though
he
had
met
a
comrade
his
was
the
only
familiar
face
among
all
those
people
who
were
speaking
his
language
he
was
ghastly
in
hue
with
sunken
features
and
an
impalpable
glaze
spreading
over
his
eyes
he
had
no
visible
wounds
but
from
under
the
cloak
spread
over
his
abdomen
his
torn
intestines
exhaled
a
fatal
warning
the
presence
of
don
marcelo
made
him
guess
where
they
had
brought
him
and
little
by
little
he
his
recollections
as
though
the
old
gentleman
might
be
interested
in
the
whereabouts
of
his
comrades
he
told
him
all
he
knew
in
a
weak
and
strained
voice
bad
luck
for
their
brigade
they
had
reached
the
front
at
a
critical
moment
for
the
reserve
troops
commandant
blumhardt
had
died
at
the
very
first
a
shell
of
taking
off
his
head
dead
too
were
all
the
officers
who
had
lodged
in
the
castle
his
excellency
had
had
his
jaw
bone
torn
off
by
a
fragment
of
shell
he
had
seen
him
on
the
ground
howling
with
pain
drawing
a
portrait
from
his
breast
and
trying
to
kiss
it
with
his
broken
mouth
he
had
himself
been
hit
in
the
stomach
by
the
same
shell
he
had
lain
hours
on
the
field
before
he
was
picked
up
by
the
ambulance
corps
and
with
the
mania
of
the
university
man
whose
hobby
is
to
see
everything
reasoned
out
and
logically
explained
he
added
in
that
supreme
moment
with
the
tenacity
of
those
who
die
talking
sad
war
sir
many
premises
are
lacking
in
order
to
decide
who
is
the
culpable
party
when
the
war
is
ended
they
will
have
to
will
have
to
and
he
closed
his
eyes
overcome
by
the
effort
desnoyers
left
the
dead
man
thinking
to
himself
poor
fellow
he
was
placing
the
hour
of
justice
at
the
termination
of
the
war
and
meanwhile
hundreds
like
him
were
dying
disappearing
with
all
their
scruples
of
ponderous
and
disciplined
reasoning
that
night
there
was
no
sleep
on
the
place
the
walls
of
the
lodge
were
creaking
the
glass
crashing
and
breaking
the
two
women
in
the
adjoining
room
crying
out
nervously
the
noise
of
the
german
fire
was
beginning
to
mingle
with
that
of
other
explosives
close
at
hand
he
surmised
that
this
was
the
smashing
of
the
french
projectiles
which
were
coming
in
search
of
the
enemy
s
artillery
above
the
marne
for
a
few
minutes
his
hopes
revived
as
the
possibility
of
victory
flashed
into
his
mind
but
he
was
so
depressed
by
his
forlorn
situation
that
such
a
hope
evaporated
as
quickly
as
it
had
come
his
own
troops
were
advancing
but
this
advance
did
not
perhaps
represent
more
than
a
local
gain
the
line
of
battle
was
so
extensive
it
was
going
to
be
as
in
the
french
would
achieve
partial
victories
modified
at
the
last
moment
by
the
strategy
of
the
enemies
until
they
were
turned
into
complete
defeat
after
midnight
the
cannonading
ceased
but
silence
was
by
no
means
automobiles
were
rolling
around
the
lodge
midst
hoarse
shouts
of
command
it
must
be
the
hospital
convoy
that
was
evacuating
the
castle
then
near
daybreak
the
thudding
of
horses
hoofs
and
the
wheels
of
chugging
machines
thundered
through
the
gates
making
the
ground
tremble
half
an
hour
afterwards
sounded
the
tramp
of
multitudes
moving
at
a
quick
pace
dying
away
in
the
depths
of
the
park
at
dawn
the
old
gentleman
leaped
from
his
bed
and
the
first
thing
he
spied
from
the
cottage
window
was
the
flag
of
the
red
cross
still
floating
from
the
top
of
the
castle
there
were
no
more
cots
under
the
trees
on
the
bridge
he
met
one
of
the
doctors
and
several
assistants
the
hospital
force
had
gone
with
all
its
transportable
patients
there
only
remained
in
the
castle
under
the
care
of
a
company
those
most
gravely
wounded
the
valkyries
of
the
health
department
had
also
disappeared
the
shylock
was
among
those
left
behind
and
on
seeing
don
marcelo
afar
off
he
smiled
and
immediately
vanished
a
few
minutes
after
he
returned
with
full
hands
never
before
had
he
been
so
generous
foreseeing
pressing
necessity
the
hungry
man
put
his
hands
in
his
pockets
as
usual
but
was
astonished
to
learn
from
the
orderly
s
emphatic
gestures
that
he
did
not
wish
any
money
nein
nein
what
generosity
was
this
the
german
persisted
in
his
negatives
his
enormous
mouth
expanded
in
an
ingratiating
grin
as
he
laid
his
heavy
paws
on
marcelo
s
shoulders
he
appeared
like
a
good
dog
a
meek
dog
fawning
and
licking
the
hands
of
the
coaxing
to
be
taken
along
with
him
franzosen
he
did
not
know
how
to
say
any
more
but
the
frenchman
read
in
his
words
the
desire
to
make
him
understand
that
he
had
always
been
in
great
sympathy
with
the
french
something
very
important
was
evidently
transpiring
the
air
of
those
left
behind
in
the
castle
and
the
sudden
servility
of
this
plowman
in
uniform
made
it
very
apparent
some
distance
beyond
the
castle
he
saw
soldiers
many
soldiers
a
battalion
of
infantry
had
spread
itself
along
the
walls
with
trucks
draught
horses
and
swift
mounts
with
their
pikes
the
soldiers
were
making
small
openings
in
the
mud
walls
shaping
them
into
a
border
of
little
pinnacles
others
were
kneeling
or
sitting
near
the
apertures
taking
off
their
knapsacks
in
order
that
they
might
be
less
hampered
afar
off
the
cannon
were
booming
and
in
the
intervals
between
their
detonations
could
be
heard
the
bursting
of
shrapnel
the
bubbling
of
frying
oil
the
grinding
of
a
and
the
incessant
crackling
of
fleecy
clouds
were
floating
over
the
fields
giving
to
near
objects
the
indefinite
lines
of
unreality
the
sun
was
a
faint
spot
seen
between
curtains
of
mist
the
trees
were
weeping
fog
moisture
from
all
the
cracks
in
their
bark
a
thunderclap
rent
the
air
so
forcibly
that
it
seemed
very
near
the
castle
desnoyers
trembled
believing
that
he
had
received
a
blow
in
the
chest
the
other
men
remained
impassive
with
their
customary
indifference
a
cannon
had
just
been
discharged
but
a
few
feet
away
from
him
and
not
till
then
did
he
realize
that
two
batteries
had
been
installed
in
the
park
the
pieces
of
artillery
were
hidden
under
mounds
of
branches
the
gunners
having
felled
trees
in
order
to
mask
their
monsters
more
perfectly
he
saw
them
arranging
the
last
with
shovels
they
were
forming
a
border
of
earth
a
foot
in
width
around
each
piece
this
border
guarded
the
feet
of
the
operators
whose
bodies
were
protected
by
steel
shields
on
both
sides
of
them
then
they
raised
a
breastwork
of
trunks
and
boughs
leaving
only
the
mouth
of
the
cylindrical
mortar
visible
by
degrees
don
marcelo
became
accustomed
to
the
firing
which
seemed
to
be
creating
a
vacuum
within
his
cranium
he
ground
his
teeth
and
clenched
his
fists
at
every
detonation
but
stood
with
no
desire
to
leave
dominated
by
the
violence
of
the
explosions
admiring
the
serenity
of
these
men
who
were
giving
orders
erect
and
coolly
or
moving
like
humble
menials
around
their
roaring
metal
beasts
all
his
ideas
seemed
to
have
been
snatched
away
by
that
first
discharge
of
cannon
his
brain
was
living
in
the
present
moment
only
he
turned
his
eyes
insistently
toward
the
white
and
red
banner
which
was
waving
from
the
mansion
that
is
treachery
he
thought
a
breach
of
far
away
on
the
other
side
of
the
marne
the
french
artillery
were
belching
forth
their
deadly
fire
he
could
imagine
their
handiwork
from
the
little
yellowish
clouds
that
were
floating
in
the
air
and
the
columns
of
smoke
which
were
spouting
forth
at
various
points
of
the
landscape
where
the
german
troops
were
hidden
forming
a
line
which
appeared
to
lose
itself
in
infinity
an
atmosphere
of
protection
and
respect
seemed
to
be
enveloping
the
castle
the
morning
mists
had
dissolved
the
sun
was
finally
showing
its
bright
and
limpid
light
lengthening
the
shadows
of
men
and
trees
to
fantastic
dimensions
hills
and
woods
came
forth
from
the
haze
fresh
and
dripping
after
their
morning
bath
the
entire
valley
was
now
completely
exposed
and
desnoyers
was
surprised
to
see
the
river
from
the
spot
to
which
he
had
been
rooted
the
cannon
having
opened
great
windows
in
the
woods
that
had
hid
it
from
view
what
most
astonished
him
in
looking
over
this
landscape
smiling
and
lovely
in
the
morning
light
was
that
nobody
was
to
be
seen
absolutely
nobody
mountain
tops
and
forests
were
bellowing
without
anyone
s
being
in
evidence
there
must
be
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
men
in
the
space
swept
by
his
piercing
gaze
and
yet
not
a
human
being
was
visible
the
deadly
boom
of
arms
was
causing
the
air
to
vibrate
without
leaving
any
optical
trace
there
was
no
other
smoke
but
that
of
the
explosions
the
black
spirals
that
were
flinging
their
great
shells
to
burst
on
the
ground
these
were
rising
on
all
sides
encircling
the
castle
like
a
ring
of
giant
tops
but
not
one
of
that
orderly
circle
ventured
to
touch
the
edifice
don
marcelo
again
stared
at
the
red
cross
flag
it
is
treachery
he
kept
repeating
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
selfishly
rejoicing
in
the
base
expedient
since
it
served
to
defend
his
property
the
battalion
was
at
last
completely
installed
the
entire
length
of
the
wall
opposite
the
river
the
soldiers
kneeling
were
supporting
their
guns
on
the
newly
made
turrets
and
grooves
and
seemed
satisfied
with
this
rest
after
a
night
of
battling
retreat
they
all
appeared
sleeping
with
their
eyes
open
little
by
little
they
were
letting
themselves
drop
back
on
their
heels
or
seeking
the
support
of
their
knapsacks
snores
were
heard
in
the
brief
spaces
between
the
artillery
fire
the
officials
standing
behind
them
were
examining
the
country
with
their
field
glasses
or
talking
in
knots
some
appeared
disheartened
others
furious
at
the
backward
flight
that
had
been
going
on
since
the
day
before
the
majority
appeared
calm
with
the
passivity
of
obedience
the
battle
front
was
immense
who
could
foresee
the
outcome
there
they
were
in
full
retreat
but
in
other
places
perhaps
their
comrades
might
be
advancing
with
decided
gains
until
the
very
last
moment
no
soldier
knows
certainly
the
fate
of
the
struggle
what
was
most
grieving
this
detachment
was
the
fact
that
it
was
all
the
time
getting
further
away
from
paris
don
marcelo
s
eye
was
caught
by
a
sparkling
circle
of
glass
a
monocle
fixed
upon
him
with
aggressive
insistence
a
lank
lieutenant
with
the
corseted
waist
of
the
officers
that
he
had
seen
in
berlin
a
genuine
junker
was
a
few
feet
away
sword
in
hand
behind
his
men
like
a
wrathful
and
glowering
shepherd
what
are
you
doing
here
he
said
gruffly
desnoyers
explained
that
he
was
the
owner
of
the
castle
french
continued
the
lieutenant
yes
the
official
scowled
in
hostile
meditation
feeling
the
necessity
of
saying
something
against
the
enemy
the
shouts
and
antics
of
his
put
a
summary
end
to
his
reflections
they
were
all
staring
upward
and
the
old
man
followed
their
gaze
for
an
hour
past
there
had
been
streaking
through
the
air
frightful
roarings
enveloped
in
yellowish
vapors
strips
of
cloud
which
seemed
to
contain
wheels
revolving
with
frenzied
rotation
they
were
the
projectiles
of
the
heavy
german
artillery
which
fired
from
various
distances
threw
their
great
shells
over
the
castle
certainly
that
could
not
be
what
was
interesting
the
officials
he
half
shut
his
eyes
in
order
to
see
better
and
finally
near
the
edge
of
a
cloud
he
distinguished
a
species
of
mosquito
flashing
in
the
sunlight
between
brief
intervals
of
silence
could
be
heard
the
distant
faint
buzz
announcing
its
presence
the
officers
nodded
their
heads
franzosen
desnoyers
thought
so
too
he
could
not
believe
that
the
enemy
s
two
black
crosses
were
between
those
wings
instead
he
saw
with
his
mind
s
eye
two
tricolored
rings
like
the
circular
spots
which
color
the
fluttering
wings
of
butterflies
this
explained
the
agitation
of
the
germans
the
french
remained
motionless
for
a
few
seconds
over
the
castle
regardless
of
the
white
bubbles
exploding
underneath
and
around
it
in
vain
the
cannon
nearest
hurled
their
deadly
fire
it
wheeled
rapidly
and
returned
to
the
place
from
which
it
came
it
must
have
taken
in
the
whole
situation
thought
the
old
frenchman
it
has
found
them
out
it
knows
what
is
going
on
he
guessed
rightly
that
this
information
would
swiftly
change
the
course
of
events
everything
which
had
been
happening
in
the
early
morning
hours
was
going
to
sink
into
insignificance
compared
with
what
was
coming
now
he
shuddered
with
fear
the
irresistible
fear
of
the
unknown
and
yet
at
the
same
time
he
was
filled
with
curiosity
impatience
and
nervous
dread
before
a
danger
that
threatened
and
would
not
stay
its
relentless
course
outside
the
park
but
a
short
distance
from
the
mud
wall
sounded
a
strident
explosion
like
a
stupendous
blow
from
a
gigantic
axe
an
axe
as
big
as
his
castle
there
began
flying
through
the
air
entire
treetops
trunks
split
in
two
great
chunks
of
earth
with
the
vegetation
still
clinging
a
rain
of
dirt
that
obscured
the
heavens
some
stones
fell
down
from
the
wall
the
germans
crouched
but
with
no
visible
emotion
they
knew
what
it
meant
they
had
been
expecting
it
as
something
inevitable
after
seeing
the
french
aeroplane
the
red
cross
flag
could
no
longer
deceive
the
enemy
s
artillery
don
marcelo
had
not
time
to
recover
from
his
surprise
before
there
came
a
second
explosion
nearer
the
mud
wall
a
third
inside
the
park
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
been
suddenly
flung
into
another
world
from
which
he
was
seeing
men
and
things
across
a
fantastic
atmosphere
which
roared
and
rocked
and
destroyed
with
the
violence
of
its
reverberations
he
was
stunned
with
the
awfulness
of
it
all
and
yet
he
was
not
afraid
until
then
he
had
imagined
fear
in
a
very
different
form
he
felt
an
agonizing
vacuum
in
his
stomach
he
staggered
violently
all
the
time
as
though
some
force
were
pushing
him
about
giving
him
first
a
blow
on
the
chest
and
then
another
on
the
back
to
straighten
him
up
a
strong
smell
of
acids
penetrated
the
atmosphere
making
respiration
very
difficult
and
filling
his
eyes
with
smarting
tears
on
the
other
hand
the
uproar
no
longer
disturbed
him
it
did
not
exist
for
him
he
supposed
it
was
still
going
on
from
the
trembling
air
the
shaking
of
things
around
him
in
the
whirlwind
which
was
bending
men
double
but
was
not
reacting
within
his
body
he
had
lost
the
faculty
of
hearing
all
the
strength
of
his
senses
had
concentrated
themselves
in
looking
his
eyes
appeared
to
have
acquired
multiple
facets
like
those
of
certain
insects
he
saw
what
was
happening
before
beside
behind
him
simultaneously
witnessing
extraordinary
things
as
though
all
the
laws
of
life
had
been
capriciously
overthrown
an
official
a
few
feet
away
suddenly
took
an
inexplicable
flight
he
began
to
rise
without
losing
his
military
rigidity
still
helmeted
with
furrowed
brow
moustache
blond
and
short
chest
and
gloved
hands
still
holding
and
map
but
there
his
individuality
stopped
the
lower
extremities
in
their
grayish
leggings
remained
on
the
ground
inanimate
as
reddening
empty
moulds
the
trunk
in
its
violent
ascent
spread
its
contents
abroad
like
a
bursting
rocket
further
on
some
gunners
standing
upright
were
suddenly
stretched
full
length
converted
into
a
motionless
row
bathed
in
blood
the
line
of
infantry
was
lying
close
to
the
ground
the
men
had
huddled
themselves
together
near
the
loopholes
through
which
they
aimed
their
guns
trying
to
make
themselves
less
visible
many
had
placed
their
knapsacks
over
their
heads
or
at
their
backs
to
defend
themselves
from
the
flying
bits
of
shell
if
they
moved
at
all
it
was
only
to
worm
their
way
further
into
the
earth
trying
to
hollow
it
out
with
their
stomachs
many
of
them
had
changed
position
with
mysterious
rapidity
now
lying
stretched
on
their
backs
as
though
asleep
one
had
his
uniform
torn
open
across
the
abdomen
showing
between
the
rents
of
the
cloth
slabs
of
flesh
blue
and
red
that
protruded
and
swelled
up
with
a
bubbling
expansion
another
had
his
legs
shot
away
and
was
looking
around
with
surprised
eyes
and
a
black
mouth
rounded
into
an
effort
to
howl
but
from
which
no
sound
ever
came
desnoyers
had
lost
all
notion
of
time
he
could
not
tell
whether
he
had
been
rooted
to
that
spot
for
many
hours
or
for
a
single
moment
the
only
thing
that
caused
him
anxiety
was
the
persistent
trembling
of
his
legs
which
were
refusing
to
sustain
him
something
fell
behind
him
it
was
raining
ruin
turning
his
head
he
saw
his
castle
completely
transformed
half
of
the
tower
had
just
been
carried
off
the
pieces
of
slate
were
scattered
everywhere
in
tiny
chips
the
walls
were
crumbling
loose
window
frames
were
balancing
on
edge
like
fragments
of
stage
scenery
and
the
old
wood
of
the
tower
hood
was
beginning
to
burn
like
a
torch
the
spectacle
of
this
instantaneous
change
in
his
property
impressed
him
more
than
the
ravages
of
death
making
him
realize
the
cyclopean
power
of
the
blind
avenging
forces
raging
around
him
the
vital
force
that
had
been
concentrated
in
his
eyes
now
spread
to
his
feet
and
he
started
to
run
without
knowing
whither
feeling
the
same
necessity
to
hide
himself
as
had
those
men
enchained
by
discipline
who
were
trying
to
flatten
themselves
into
the
earth
in
imitation
of
the
reptile
s
pliant
invisibility
his
instinct
was
pushing
him
toward
the
lodge
but
half
way
up
the
avenue
he
was
stopped
by
another
lot
of
astounding
transformations
an
unseen
hand
had
just
snatched
away
half
of
the
cottage
roof
the
entire
side
wall
doubled
over
forming
a
cascade
of
bricks
and
dust
the
interior
rooms
were
now
exposed
to
view
like
a
theatrical
setting
the
kitchen
where
he
had
eaten
the
upper
floor
with
the
room
in
which
he
descried
his
still
unmade
bed
the
poor
women
he
turned
around
running
now
toward
the
castle
trying
to
make
the
in
which
he
had
been
fastened
for
the
night
and
when
he
finally
found
himself
under
those
dusty
cobwebs
he
felt
as
though
he
were
in
the
most
luxurious
salon
and
he
devoutly
blessed
the
good
workmanship
of
the
castle
builders
the
subterranean
silence
began
gradually
to
bring
back
his
sense
of
hearing
the
cannonading
of
the
germans
and
the
bursting
of
the
french
shells
sounded
from
his
retreat
like
a
distant
tempest
there
came
into
his
mind
the
eulogies
which
he
had
been
accustomed
to
lavish
upon
the
cannon
of
without
knowing
anything
about
it
except
by
hearsay
now
he
had
witnessed
its
effects
it
shoots
too
well
he
muttered
in
a
short
time
it
would
finish
destroying
his
castle
he
was
finding
such
perfection
excessive
but
he
soon
repented
of
these
selfish
lamentations
an
idea
tenacious
as
remorse
had
fastened
itself
in
his
brain
it
now
seemed
to
him
that
all
he
was
passing
through
was
an
expiation
for
the
great
mistake
of
his
youth
he
had
evaded
the
service
of
his
country
and
now
he
was
enveloped
in
all
the
horrors
of
war
with
the
humiliation
of
a
passive
and
defenseless
being
without
any
of
the
soldier
s
satisfaction
of
being
able
to
return
the
blows
he
was
going
to
die
he
was
sure
of
that
but
a
shameful
death
unknown
and
inglorious
the
ruins
of
his
mansion
were
going
to
become
his
sepulchre
and
the
certainty
of
dying
there
in
the
darkness
like
a
rat
that
sees
the
openings
of
his
hole
being
closed
up
made
this
refuge
intolerable
above
him
the
tornado
was
still
raging
a
peal
like
thunder
boomed
above
his
head
and
then
came
the
crash
of
a
landslide
another
projectile
must
have
fallen
upon
the
building
he
heard
shrieks
of
agony
yells
and
precipitous
steps
on
the
floor
above
him
perhaps
the
shell
in
its
blind
fury
had
blown
to
pieces
many
of
the
dying
in
the
salons
fearing
to
remain
buried
in
his
retreat
he
bounded
up
the
cellar
stairs
two
steps
at
a
time
as
he
scudded
across
the
first
floor
he
saw
the
sky
through
the
shattered
roofs
along
the
edges
were
hanging
sections
of
wood
fragments
of
swinging
tile
and
furniture
stopped
halfway
in
its
flight
crossing
the
hall
he
had
to
clamber
over
much
rubbish
he
stumbled
over
broken
and
twisted
iron
parts
of
beds
rained
from
the
upper
rooms
into
the
mountain
of
debris
in
which
he
saw
convulsed
limbs
and
heard
anguished
voices
that
he
could
not
understand
he
leaped
as
he
ran
feeling
the
same
longing
for
light
and
free
air
as
those
who
rush
from
the
hold
to
the
deck
of
a
shipwreck
while
sheltered
in
the
darkness
more
time
had
elapsed
than
he
had
supposed
the
sun
was
now
very
high
he
saw
in
the
garden
more
corpses
in
tragic
and
grotesque
postures
the
wounded
were
doubled
over
with
pain
or
lying
on
the
ground
or
propping
themselves
against
the
trees
in
painful
silence
some
had
opened
their
knapsacks
and
drawn
out
their
sanitary
kits
and
were
trying
to
care
for
their
cuts
the
infantry
was
now
firing
incessantly
the
number
of
riflemen
had
increased
new
bands
of
soldiers
were
entering
the
park
some
with
a
sergeant
at
their
head
others
followed
by
an
officer
carrying
a
revolver
at
his
breast
as
though
guiding
his
men
with
it
this
must
be
the
infantry
expelled
from
their
position
near
the
river
which
had
come
to
reinforce
the
second
line
of
defense
the
mitrailleuses
were
adding
their
to
the
cracks
of
the
fusileers
the
hum
of
the
invisible
swarms
was
buzzing
incessantly
thousands
of
sticky
were
droning
around
desnoyers
without
his
even
seeing
them
the
bark
of
the
trees
was
being
stripped
by
unseen
hands
the
leaves
were
falling
in
torrents
the
boughs
were
shaken
by
opposing
forces
the
stones
on
the
ground
were
being
crushed
by
a
mysterious
foot
all
inanimate
objects
seemed
to
have
acquired
a
fantastic
life
the
zinc
spoons
of
the
soldiers
the
metallic
parts
of
their
outfit
the
pails
of
the
artillery
were
all
clanking
as
though
in
an
imperceptible
hailstorm
he
saw
a
cannon
lying
on
its
side
with
the
wheels
broken
and
turned
over
among
many
men
who
appeared
asleep
he
saw
soldiers
who
stretched
themselves
out
without
a
contraction
without
a
sound
as
though
overcome
by
sudden
drowsiness
others
were
howling
and
dragging
themselves
forward
in
a
sitting
position
the
old
man
felt
an
extreme
sensation
of
heat
the
pungent
perfume
of
explosive
drugs
brought
the
tears
to
his
eyes
and
clawed
at
his
throat
at
the
same
time
he
was
chilly
and
felt
his
forehead
freezing
in
a
glacial
sweat
he
had
to
leave
the
bridge
several
soldiers
were
passing
bearing
the
wounded
to
the
edifice
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
it
was
falling
in
ruins
suddenly
he
was
sprinkled
from
head
to
foot
as
if
the
earth
had
opened
to
make
way
for
a
waterspout
a
shell
had
fallen
into
the
moat
throwing
up
an
enormous
column
of
water
making
the
carp
sleeping
in
the
mud
fly
into
fragments
breaking
a
part
of
the
edges
and
grinding
to
powder
the
white
balustrades
with
their
great
urns
of
flowers
he
started
to
run
on
with
the
blindness
of
terror
when
he
suddenly
saw
before
him
the
same
little
round
crystal
examining
him
coolly
it
was
the
junker
the
officer
of
the
monocle
with
the
end
of
his
revolver
the
german
pointed
to
two
pails
a
short
distance
away
ordering
desnoyers
to
fill
them
from
the
lagoon
and
give
the
water
to
the
men
overcome
by
the
sun
although
the
imperious
tone
admitted
of
no
reply
don
marcelo
tried
nevertheless
to
resist
he
received
a
blow
from
the
revolver
on
his
chest
at
the
same
time
that
the
lieutenant
slapped
him
in
the
face
the
old
man
doubled
over
longing
to
weep
longing
to
perish
but
no
tears
came
nor
did
life
escape
from
his
body
under
this
affront
as
he
wished
with
the
two
buckets
in
his
hands
he
found
himself
dipping
up
water
from
the
canal
carrying
it
the
length
of
the
file
giving
it
to
men
who
each
in
his
turn
dropped
his
gun
to
gulp
the
liquid
with
the
avidity
of
panting
beasts
he
was
no
longer
afraid
of
the
shrill
shrieks
of
invisible
bodies
his
one
great
longing
was
to
die
he
was
strongly
convinced
that
he
was
going
to
die
his
sufferings
were
too
great
there
was
no
longer
any
place
in
the
world
for
him
he
had
to
pass
by
breaches
opened
in
the
wall
by
the
bursting
shells
there
was
no
natural
object
to
arrest
the
eye
looking
through
these
gaps
hedges
and
groves
had
been
swept
away
or
blotted
out
by
the
fire
of
the
artillery
he
descried
at
the
foot
of
the
highway
near
his
castle
several
of
the
attacking
columns
which
had
crossed
the
marne
the
advancing
forces
were
coming
doggedly
on
apparently
unmoved
by
the
steady
deadly
fire
of
the
germans
soon
they
were
rushing
forward
with
leaps
and
bounds
by
companies
shielding
themselves
behind
bits
of
upland
in
bends
of
the
road
in
order
to
send
forth
their
blasts
of
death
the
old
man
was
now
fired
with
a
desperate
resolution
since
he
had
to
die
let
a
french
ball
kill
him
and
he
advanced
very
erect
with
his
two
pails
among
those
men
shooting
lying
down
then
with
a
sudden
fear
he
stood
still
hanging
his
head
a
second
thought
had
told
him
that
the
bullet
which
he
might
receive
would
be
one
danger
less
for
the
enemy
it
would
be
better
for
them
to
kill
the
germans
and
he
began
to
cherish
the
hope
that
he
might
get
possession
of
some
weapon
from
those
dying
around
him
and
fall
upon
that
junker
who
had
struck
him
he
was
filling
his
pails
for
the
third
time
and
murderously
contemplating
the
lieutenant
s
back
when
something
occurred
so
absurd
and
unnatural
that
it
reminded
him
of
the
fantastic
flash
of
the
cinematograph
the
officer
s
head
suddenly
disappeared
two
jets
of
blood
spurted
from
his
severed
neck
and
his
body
collapsed
like
an
empty
sack
at
the
same
time
a
cyclone
was
sweeping
the
length
of
the
wall
tearing
up
groves
overturning
cannon
and
carrying
away
people
in
a
whirlwind
as
though
they
were
dry
leaves
he
inferred
that
death
was
now
blowing
from
another
direction
until
then
it
had
come
from
the
front
on
the
river
side
battling
with
the
enemy
s
line
ensconced
behind
the
walls
now
with
the
swiftness
of
an
atmospheric
change
it
was
blustering
from
the
depths
of
the
park
a
skillful
manoeuver
of
the
aggressors
the
use
of
a
distant
road
a
chance
bend
in
the
german
line
had
enabled
the
french
to
collect
their
cannon
in
a
new
position
attacking
the
occupants
of
the
castle
with
a
flank
movement
it
was
a
lucky
thing
for
don
marcelo
that
he
had
lingered
a
few
moments
on
the
bank
of
the
fosse
sheltered
by
the
bulk
of
the
edifice
the
fire
of
the
hidden
battery
passed
the
length
of
the
avenue
carrying
off
the
living
destroying
for
a
second
time
the
dead
killing
horses
breaking
the
wheels
of
vehicles
and
making
the
gun
carriages
fly
through
the
air
with
the
flames
of
a
volcano
in
whose
red
and
bluish
depths
black
bodies
were
leaping
he
saw
hundreds
of
fallen
men
he
saw
disembowelled
horses
trampling
on
their
entrails
the
death
harvest
was
not
being
reaped
in
sheaves
the
entire
field
was
being
mowed
down
with
a
single
flash
of
the
sickle
and
as
though
the
batteries
opposite
divined
the
catastrophe
they
redoubled
their
fire
sending
down
a
torrent
of
shells
they
fell
on
all
sides
beyond
the
castle
at
the
end
of
the
park
craters
were
opening
in
the
woods
vomiting
forth
the
entire
trunks
of
trees
the
projectiles
were
hurling
from
their
pits
the
bodies
interred
the
night
before
those
still
alive
were
firing
through
the
gaps
in
the
walls
then
they
sprang
up
with
the
greatest
haste
some
grasped
their
bayonets
pale
with
clamped
lips
and
a
mad
glare
in
their
eyes
others
turned
their
backs
running
toward
the
exit
from
the
park
regardless
of
the
shouts
of
their
officers
and
the
revolver
shots
sent
after
the
fugitives
all
this
occurred
with
dizzying
rapidity
like
a
nightmare
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
came
a
murmur
swelling
in
volume
like
that
of
the
sea
desnoyers
heard
shouts
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
some
hoarse
discordant
voices
were
singing
the
marseillaise
the
were
working
with
the
swift
steadiness
of
sewing
machines
the
attack
was
going
to
be
opposed
with
furious
resistance
the
germans
crazed
with
fury
shot
and
shot
in
one
of
the
breaches
appeared
a
red
kepis
followed
by
legs
of
the
same
color
trying
to
clamber
over
the
ruins
but
this
vision
was
instantly
blotted
out
by
the
sprinkling
from
the
machine
guns
making
the
invaders
fall
in
great
heaps
on
the
other
side
of
the
wall
don
marcelo
never
knew
exactly
how
the
change
took
place
suddenly
he
saw
the
red
trousers
within
the
park
with
irresistible
bounds
they
were
springing
over
the
wall
slipping
through
the
yawning
gaps
and
darting
out
from
the
depths
of
the
woods
by
invisible
paths
they
were
little
soldiers
husky
panting
perspiring
with
torn
cloaks
and
mingled
with
them
in
the
disorder
of
the
charge
african
marksmen
with
devilish
eyes
and
foaming
mouths
zouaves
in
wide
breeches
and
chasseurs
in
blue
uniforms
the
german
officers
wanted
to
die
with
upraised
swords
after
having
exhausted
the
shots
in
their
revolvers
they
advanced
upon
their
assailants
followed
by
the
soldiers
who
still
obeyed
them
there
was
a
scuffle
a
wild
melee
to
the
trembling
spectator
it
seemed
as
though
the
world
had
fallen
into
profound
silence
the
yells
of
the
combatants
the
thud
of
colliding
bodies
the
clang
of
arms
seemed
as
nothing
after
the
cannon
had
quieted
down
he
saw
men
pierced
through
the
middle
by
gun
points
whose
reddened
ends
came
out
through
their
kidneys
muskets
raining
blows
adversaries
that
grappled
in
tussles
rolling
over
and
over
on
the
ground
trying
to
gain
the
advantage
by
kicks
and
bites
the
fronts
had
entirely
disappeared
and
he
now
saw
only
backs
of
that
color
fleeing
toward
the
exit
filtering
among
the
trees
falling
midway
in
their
flight
when
hit
by
the
pursuing
balls
many
of
the
invaders
were
unable
to
chase
the
fugitives
because
they
were
occupied
in
repelling
with
rude
thrusts
of
their
bayonets
the
bodies
falling
upon
them
in
agonizing
convulsions
don
marcelo
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
very
thick
of
these
mortal
combats
jumping
up
and
down
like
a
child
waving
his
hands
and
shouting
with
all
his
might
when
he
came
to
himself
again
he
was
hugging
the
grimy
head
of
a
young
french
officer
who
was
looking
at
him
in
astonishment
he
probably
thought
him
crazy
on
receiving
his
kisses
on
hearing
his
incoherent
torrent
of
words
emotionally
exhausted
the
worn
old
man
continued
to
weep
after
the
officer
had
freed
himself
with
a
jerk
he
needed
to
give
vent
to
his
feelings
after
so
many
days
of
anguished
vive
la
france
his
beloved
french
were
already
within
the
park
gates
they
were
running
bayonets
in
hand
in
pursuit
of
the
last
remnants
of
the
german
battalion
trying
to
escape
toward
the
village
a
group
of
horsemen
passed
along
the
road
they
were
dragoons
coming
to
complete
the
rout
but
their
horses
were
fagged
out
nothing
but
the
fever
of
victory
transmitted
from
man
to
beast
had
sustained
their
painful
pace
one
of
the
equestrians
came
to
a
stop
near
the
entrance
of
the
park
the
famished
horse
eagerly
devouring
the
herbage
while
his
rider
settled
down
in
the
saddle
as
though
asleep
desnoyers
touched
him
on
the
hip
in
order
to
waken
him
but
he
immediately
rolled
off
on
the
opposite
side
he
was
dead
with
his
entrails
protruding
from
his
body
but
swept
on
with
the
others
he
had
been
brought
thus
far
on
his
steady
steed
enormous
tops
of
iron
and
smoke
now
began
falling
in
the
neighborhood
the
german
artillery
was
opening
a
retaliatory
fire
against
its
lost
positions
the
advance
continued
there
passed
toward
the
north
battalions
squadrons
and
batteries
worn
weary
and
grimy
covered
with
dust
and
mud
but
kindled
with
an
ardor
that
galvanized
their
flagging
energy
the
french
cannon
began
thundering
on
the
village
side
bands
of
soldiers
were
exploring
the
castle
and
the
nearest
woods
from
the
ruined
rooms
from
the
depths
of
the
cellars
from
the
clumps
of
shrubbery
in
the
park
from
the
stables
and
burned
garage
came
surging
forth
men
dressed
in
greenish
gray
and
pointed
helmets
they
all
threw
up
their
arms
extending
their
open
hands
kamarades
kamarades
non
with
the
restlessness
of
remorse
they
were
in
dread
of
immediate
execution
they
had
suddenly
lost
all
their
haughtiness
on
finding
that
they
no
longer
had
any
official
powers
and
were
free
from
discipline
some
of
those
who
knew
a
little
french
spoke
of
their
wives
and
children
in
order
to
soften
the
enemies
that
were
threatening
them
with
their
bayonets
a
brawny
teuton
came
up
to
desnoyers
and
clapped
him
on
the
back
it
was
redbeard
he
pressed
his
heart
and
then
pointed
to
the
owner
of
the
castle
franzosen
great
friend
of
the
franzosen
and
he
grinned
ingratiatingly
at
his
protector
don
marcelo
remained
at
the
castle
until
the
following
morning
and
was
astounded
to
see
georgette
and
her
mother
emerge
unexpectedly
from
the
depths
of
the
ruined
lodge
they
were
weeping
at
the
sight
of
the
french
uniforms
it
could
not
go
on
sobbed
the
widow
god
does
not
after
a
bad
night
among
the
ruins
the
owner
decided
to
leave
villeblanche
what
was
there
for
him
to
do
now
in
the
destroyed
castle
the
presence
of
so
many
dead
was
racking
his
nerves
there
were
hundreds
there
were
thousands
the
soldiers
and
the
farmers
were
interring
great
heaps
of
them
wherever
he
went
digging
burial
trenches
close
to
the
castle
in
all
the
avenues
of
the
park
in
the
garden
paths
around
the
outbuildings
even
the
depths
of
the
circular
lagoon
were
filled
with
corpses
how
could
he
ever
live
again
in
that
tragic
community
composed
mostly
of
his
enemies
farewell
forever
castle
of
villeblanche
he
turned
his
steps
toward
paris
planning
to
get
there
the
best
way
he
could
he
came
upon
corpses
everywhere
but
they
were
not
all
the
uniform
many
of
his
countrymen
had
fallen
in
the
gallant
offensive
many
would
still
fall
in
the
last
throes
of
the
battle
that
was
going
on
behind
them
agitating
the
horizon
with
its
incessant
uproar
everywhere
red
pantaloons
were
sticking
up
out
of
the
stubble
hobnailed
boots
glistening
in
upright
position
near
the
roadside
livid
heads
amputated
bodies
stray
limbs
and
scattered
through
this
funereal
medley
red
kepis
and
oriental
caps
helmets
with
tufts
of
horse
hair
twisted
swords
broken
bayonets
guns
and
great
mounds
of
cannon
cartridges
dead
horses
were
strewing
the
plain
with
their
swollen
carcasses
artillery
wagons
with
their
charred
wood
and
bent
iron
frames
revealed
the
tragic
moment
of
the
explosion
rectangles
of
overturned
earth
marked
the
situation
of
the
enemy
s
batteries
before
their
retreat
amidst
the
broken
cannons
and
trucks
were
cones
of
carbonized
material
the
remains
of
men
and
horses
burned
by
the
germans
on
the
night
before
their
withdrawal
in
spite
of
these
barbarian
holocausts
corpses
were
every
where
in
infinite
numbers
there
seemed
to
be
no
end
to
their
number
it
seemed
as
though
the
earth
had
expelled
all
the
bodies
that
it
had
received
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
the
sun
was
impassively
flooding
the
fields
of
death
with
its
waves
of
light
in
its
yellowish
glow
the
pieces
of
the
bayonets
the
metal
plates
the
fittings
of
the
guns
were
sparkling
like
bits
of
crystal
the
damp
night
the
rain
the
rust
of
time
had
not
yet
modified
with
their
corrosive
action
these
relics
of
combat
but
decomposition
had
begun
to
set
in
graveyard
odors
were
all
along
the
road
increasing
in
intensity
as
desnoyers
plodded
on
toward
paris
every
half
hour
the
evidence
of
corruption
became
more
pronounced
many
of
the
dead
on
this
side
of
the
river
having
lain
there
for
three
or
four
days
bands
of
crows
at
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
rose
up
lazily
flapping
their
wings
but
returning
soon
to
blacken
the
earth
surfeited
but
not
satisfied
having
lost
all
fear
of
mankind
from
time
to
time
the
sad
pedestrian
met
living
bands
of
men
platoons
of
cavalry
gendarmes
zouaves
and
chasseurs
encamped
around
the
ruined
farmsteads
exploring
the
country
in
pursuit
of
german
fugitives
don
marcelo
had
to
explain
his
business
there
showing
the
passport
that
lacour
had
given
him
in
order
to
make
his
trip
on
the
military
train
only
in
this
way
could
he
continue
his
journey
these
soldiers
many
of
them
slightly
wounded
were
still
stimulated
by
victory
they
were
laughing
telling
stories
and
narrating
the
great
dangers
which
they
had
escaped
a
few
days
before
always
ending
with
we
are
going
to
kick
them
across
the
frontier
their
indignation
broke
forth
afresh
as
they
looked
around
at
the
blasted
towns
farms
and
single
houses
all
burned
like
skeletons
of
prehistoric
beasts
many
steel
frames
twisted
by
the
flames
were
scattered
over
the
plains
the
brick
chimneys
of
the
factories
were
either
levelled
to
the
ground
or
pierced
with
the
round
holes
made
by
shells
were
standing
up
like
giant
pastoral
flutes
forced
into
the
earth
near
the
ruined
villages
the
women
were
removing
the
earth
and
trying
to
dig
burial
trenches
but
their
labor
was
almost
useless
because
it
required
an
immense
force
to
inter
so
many
dead
we
are
all
going
to
die
after
gaining
the
victory
mused
the
old
man
the
plague
is
going
to
break
out
among
the
water
of
the
river
must
also
be
contaminated
by
this
contagion
so
when
his
thirst
became
intolerable
he
drank
in
preference
from
a
nearby
pond
but
alas
on
raising
his
head
he
saw
some
greenish
legs
on
the
surface
of
the
shallow
water
the
boots
sunk
in
the
muddy
banks
the
head
of
the
german
was
in
the
depths
of
the
pool
he
had
been
trudging
on
for
several
hours
when
he
stopped
before
a
ruined
house
which
he
believed
that
he
recognized
yes
it
was
the
tavern
where
he
had
lunched
a
few
days
ago
on
his
way
to
the
castle
he
forced
his
way
in
among
the
blackened
walls
where
a
persistent
swarm
of
flies
came
buzzing
around
him
the
smell
of
decomposing
flesh
attracted
his
attention
a
leg
which
looked
like
a
piece
of
charred
cardboard
was
wedged
in
the
ruins
looking
at
it
bitterly
he
seemed
to
hear
again
the
old
woman
with
her
grandchildren
clinging
to
her
skirts
monsieur
why
are
the
people
fleeing
war
only
concerns
the
soldiers
we
countryfolk
have
done
no
wrong
to
anybody
and
we
ought
not
to
be
half
an
hour
later
on
descending
a
hilly
path
the
traveller
had
the
most
unexpected
of
encounters
he
saw
there
a
taxicab
an
automobile
from
paris
the
chauffeur
was
walking
tranquilly
around
the
vehicle
as
if
it
were
at
the
cab
stand
and
he
promptly
entered
into
conversation
with
this
gentleman
who
appeared
to
him
as
downcast
and
dirty
as
a
tramp
with
half
of
his
livid
face
discolored
from
a
blow
he
had
brought
out
here
in
his
machine
some
parisians
who
had
wanted
to
see
the
battlefield
they
were
reporters
and
he
was
waiting
there
to
take
them
back
at
nightfall
don
marcelo
buried
his
right
hand
in
his
pocket
two
hundred
francs
if
the
man
would
drive
him
to
paris
the
chauffeur
declined
with
the
gravity
of
a
man
faithful
to
his
obligations
five
hundred
and
he
showed
his
fist
bulging
with
gold
coins
the
man
s
only
response
was
a
twirl
of
the
handle
which
started
the
machine
to
snorting
and
away
they
sped
there
was
not
a
battle
in
the
neighborhood
of
paris
every
day
in
the
year
his
other
clients
could
just
wait
and
settling
back
into
the
desnoyers
saw
the
horrors
of
the
battle
field
flying
past
at
a
dizzying
speed
and
disappearing
behind
him
he
was
rolling
toward
human
life
he
was
returning
to
civilization
as
they
came
into
paris
the
nearly
empty
streets
seemed
to
him
to
be
crowded
with
people
never
had
he
seen
the
city
so
beautiful
he
whirled
through
the
avenue
de
l
opera
whizzed
past
the
place
de
la
concorde
and
thought
he
must
be
dreaming
as
he
realized
the
gigantic
leap
that
he
had
taken
within
the
hour
he
compared
all
that
was
now
around
him
with
the
sights
on
that
plain
of
death
but
a
few
miles
away
no
no
it
was
not
possible
one
of
the
extremes
of
this
contrast
must
certainly
be
false
the
automobile
was
beginning
to
slow
down
he
must
be
now
in
the
avenue
victor
hugo
he
couldn
t
wake
up
was
that
really
his
home
the
majestic
concierge
unable
to
understand
his
forlorn
appearance
greeted
him
with
amazed
consternation
ah
monsieur
where
has
monsieur
been
in
hell
muttered
don
marcelo
his
wonderment
continued
when
he
found
himself
actually
in
his
own
apartment
going
through
its
various
rooms
he
was
somebody
once
more
the
sight
of
the
fruits
of
his
riches
and
the
enjoyment
of
home
comforts
restored
his
at
the
same
time
that
the
contrast
recalled
to
his
mind
the
recollection
of
all
the
humiliations
and
outrages
that
he
had
suffered
ah
the
scoundrels
two
mornings
later
the
door
bell
rang
a
visitor
there
came
toward
him
a
soldier
a
little
soldier
of
the
infantry
timid
with
his
kepis
in
his
hand
stuttering
excuses
in
spanish
i
knew
that
you
were
here
i
come
to
that
voice
dragging
him
from
the
dark
hallway
don
marcelo
conducted
him
to
the
balcony
how
handsome
he
looked
the
kepis
was
red
but
darkened
with
wear
the
cloak
too
large
was
torn
and
darned
the
great
shoes
had
a
strong
smell
of
leather
yet
never
had
his
son
appeared
to
him
so
elegant
so
as
now
fitted
out
in
these
rough
clothes
you
you
the
father
embraced
him
convulsively
crying
like
a
child
and
trembling
so
that
he
could
no
longer
stand
he
had
always
hoped
that
they
would
finally
understand
each
other
his
blood
was
coursing
through
the
boy
s
veins
he
was
good
with
no
other
defect
than
a
certain
obstinacy
he
was
excusing
him
now
for
all
the
past
blaming
himself
for
a
great
part
of
it
he
had
been
too
hard
you
a
soldier
he
kept
exclaiming
over
and
over
you
defending
my
country
when
it
is
not
yours
and
he
kissed
him
again
receding
a
few
steps
so
as
to
get
a
better
look
at
him
decidedly
he
was
more
fascinating
now
in
his
grotesque
uniform
than
when
he
was
so
celebrated
for
his
skill
as
a
dancer
and
idolized
by
the
women
when
the
delighted
father
was
finally
able
to
control
his
emotion
his
eyes
still
filled
with
tears
glowed
with
a
malignant
light
a
spasm
of
hatred
furrowed
his
face
go
he
said
simply
you
do
not
know
what
war
is
i
have
just
come
from
it
i
have
seen
it
close
by
this
is
not
a
war
like
other
wars
with
rational
enemies
it
is
a
hunt
of
wild
beasts
shoot
without
a
scruple
against
them
all
every
one
that
you
overcome
rids
humanity
of
a
dangerous
he
hesitated
a
few
seconds
and
then
added
with
tragic
calm
perhaps
you
may
encounter
familiar
faces
family
ties
are
not
always
formed
to
our
tastes
men
of
your
blood
are
on
the
other
side
if

of
them

not

shoot
he
is

in
biarritz
so
far
from
her
husband
in
vain
la
romantica
discoursed
on
the
dangers
of
a
return
the
government
was
still
in
bordeaux
the
president
of
the
republic
and
the
ministry
making
only
the
most
hurried
apparitions
in
the
capital
the
course
of
the
war
might
change
at
any
minute
that
little
affair
of
the
marne
was
but
a
momentary
relief
but
the
good
senora
after
having
read
don
marcelo
s
letters
opposed
an
adamantine
will
to
all
contrary
suggestions
besides
she
was
thinking
of
her
son
her
julio
now
a
soldier
she
believed
that
by
returning
to
paris
she
might
in
some
ways
be
more
in
touch
with
him
than
at
this
seaside
resort
near
the
spanish
frontier
chichi
also
wished
to
return
because
rene
was
now
filling
the
greater
part
of
her
thoughts
absence
had
shown
her
that
she
was
really
in
love
with
him
such
a
long
time
without
seeing
her
little
sugar
soldier
so
the
family
abandoned
their
hotel
life
and
returned
to
the
avenue
victor
hugo
since
the
shock
of
the
first
september
days
paris
had
been
gradually
changing
its
aspect
the
nearly
two
million
inhabitants
who
had
been
living
quietly
in
their
homes
without
letting
themselves
be
drawn
into
the
panic
had
accepted
the
victory
with
grave
serenity
none
of
them
could
explain
the
exact
course
of
the
battle
they
would
learn
all
about
it
when
it
was
entirely
finished
one
september
sunday
at
the
hour
when
the
parisians
are
accustomed
to
take
advantage
of
the
lovely
twilight
they
had
learned
from
the
newspapers
of
the
great
triumph
of
the
allies
and
of
the
great
danger
which
they
had
so
narrowly
escaped
the
people
were
delighted
but
did
not
however
abandon
their
calm
demeanor
six
weeks
of
war
had
radically
changed
the
temperament
of
turbulent
and
impressionable
paris
the
victory
was
slowly
restoring
the
capital
to
its
former
aspect
a
street
that
was
practically
deserted
a
few
weeks
before
was
now
filled
with
transients
the
shops
were
reopening
the
neighbors
accustomed
to
the
conventional
silence
of
their
deserted
apartment
houses
again
heard
sounds
of
returning
life
in
the
homes
above
and
below
them
don
marcelo
s
satisfaction
in
welcoming
his
family
home
was
considerably
clouded
by
the
presence
of
dona
elena
she
was
germany
returning
to
the
encounter
the
enemy
again
established
within
his
tents
would
he
never
be
able
to
free
himself
from
this
bondage
she
was
silent
in
her
s
presence
because
recent
events
had
rather
bewildered
her
her
countenance
was
stamped
with
a
wondering
expression
as
though
she
were
gazing
at
the
upsetting
of
the
most
elemental
physical
laws
in
reflective
silence
she
was
puzzling
over
the
marne
enigma
unable
to
understand
how
it
was
that
the
germans
had
not
conquered
the
ground
on
which
she
was
treading
and
in
order
to
explain
this
failure
she
resorted
to
the
most
absurd
suppositions
one
especially
engrossing
matter
was
increasing
her
sadness
her
sons
what
would
become
of
her
sons
don
marcelo
had
never
told
her
of
his
meeting
with
captain
von
hartrott
he
was
maintaining
absolute
silence
about
his
sojourn
at
villeblanche
he
had
no
desire
to
recount
his
adventures
at
the
battle
of
the
marne
what
was
the
use
of
saddening
his
loved
ones
with
such
miseries
he
simply
told
dona
luisa
who
was
alarmed
about
the
possible
fate
of
the
castle
that
they
would
not
be
able
to
go
there
for
many
years
to
come
because
the
hostilities
had
rendered
it
uninhabitable
a
covering
of
zinc
sheeting
had
been
substituted
for
the
ancient
roof
in
order
to
prevent
further
injury
from
wind
and
rain
to
the
wrecked
interior
later
on
after
peace
had
been
declared
they
would
think
about
its
renovation
just
now
it
had
too
many
inhabitants
and
all
the
ladies
including
dona
elena
shuddered
in
imagining
the
thousands
of
buried
bodies
forming
their
ghastly
circle
around
the
building
this
vision
made
frau
von
hartrott
again
groan
ay
my
sons
finally
for
humanity
s
sake
her
set
her
mind
at
rest
regarding
the
fate
of
one
of
them
the
captain
von
hartrott
he
was
in
perfect
health
at
the
beginning
of
the
battle
he
knew
that
this
was
so
from
a
friend
who
had
conversed
with
him
and
he
did
not
wish
to
talk
further
about
him
dona
luisa
was
spending
a
part
of
each
day
in
the
churches
trying
to
quiet
her
uneasiness
with
prayer
these
petitions
were
no
longer
vague
and
generous
for
the
fate
of
millions
of
unknown
men
for
the
victory
of
an
entire
people
with
maternal
they
were
focussed
on
one
single
person
her
son
who
was
a
soldier
like
the
others
and
perhaps
at
this
very
moment
was
exposed
to
the
greatest
danger
the
tears
that
he
had
cost
her
she
had
implored
that
he
and
his
father
might
come
to
understand
each
other
and
finally
just
as
god
was
miraculously
granting
her
supplication
julio
had
taken
himself
off
to
the
field
of
death
her
entreaties
never
went
alone
to
the
throne
of
grace
someone
was
praying
near
her
formulating
identical
requests
the
tearful
eyes
of
her
sister
were
raised
at
the
same
time
as
hers
to
the
figure
of
the
crucified
savior
lord
save
my
son
when
uttering
these
words
dona
luisa
always
saw
julio
as
he
looked
in
a
pale
photograph
which
he
had
sent
his
father
from
the
trenches
with
kepis
and
military
cloak
a
gun
in
his
right
hand
and
his
face
shadowed
by
a
growing
beard
o
lord
have
mercy
upon
us
and
dona
elena
was
at
the
same
time
contemplating
a
group
of
officers
with
helmets
and
reseda
uniforms
reinforced
with
leather
pouches
for
the
revolver
field
glasses
and
maps
with
of
the
same
material
oftentimes
when
don
marcelo
saw
them
setting
forth
together
toward
saint
honore
d
eylau
he
would
wax
very
indignant
they
are
juggling
with
god
this
is
most
unreasonable
how
could
he
grant
such
contrary
petitions
ah
these
women
and
then
with
that
superstition
which
danger
awakens
he
began
to
fear
that
his
might
cause
some
grave
disaster
to
his
son
divinity
fatigued
with
so
many
contradictory
prayers
was
going
to
turn
his
back
and
not
listen
to
any
of
them
why
did
not
this
fatal
woman
take
herself
off
he
felt
as
exasperated
at
her
presence
in
his
home
as
he
had
at
the
beginning
of
hostilities
dona
luisa
was
still
innocently
repeating
her
sister
s
statements
submitting
them
to
the
superior
criticism
of
her
husband
in
this
way
don
marcelo
had
learned
that
the
victory
of
the
marne
had
never
really
happened
it
was
an
invention
of
the
allies
the
german
generals
had
deemed
it
prudent
to
retire
through
profound
strategic
foresight
deferring
till
a
little
later
the
conquest
of
paris
and
the
french
had
done
nothing
but
follow
them
over
the
ground
which
they
had
left
free
that
was
all
she
knew
the
opinions
of
military
men
of
neutral
countries
she
had
been
talking
in
biarritz
with
some
people
of
unusual
intelligence
she
knew
what
the
german
papers
were
saying
about
it
nobody
over
there
believed
that
yarn
about
the
marne
the
people
did
not
even
know
that
there
had
been
such
a
battle
your
sister
said
that
interrupted
desnoyers
pale
with
wrath
and
amazement
but
he
could
do
nothing
but
keep
on
longing
for
the
bodily
transformation
of
this
enemy
planted
under
his
roof
ay
if
she
could
only
be
changed
into
a
man
if
only
the
evil
genius
of
her
husband
could
but
take
her
place
for
a
brief
half
hour
but
the
war
still
goes
on
said
dona
luisa
in
artless
perplexity
the
enemy
is
still
in
france
what
good
did
the
battle
of
the
marne
do
she
accepted
his
explanations
with
intelligent
noddings
of
the
head
seeming
to
take
them
all
in
and
an
hour
afterwards
would
be
repeating
the
same
doubts
she
nevertheless
began
to
evince
a
mute
hostility
toward
her
sister
until
now
she
had
been
tolerating
her
enthusiasms
in
favor
of
her
husband
s
country
because
she
always
considered
family
ties
of
more
importance
than
the
rivalries
of
nations
just
because
desnoyers
happened
to
be
a
frenchman
and
karl
a
german
she
was
not
going
to
quarrel
with
elena
but
suddenly
this
forbearance
had
vanished
her
son
was
now
in
danger
better
that
all
the
von
hartrotts
should
die
than
that
julio
should
receive
the
most
insignificant
wound
she
began
to
share
the
bellicose
sentiments
of
her
daughter
recognizing
in
her
an
exceptional
talent
for
appraising
events
and
now
desiring
all
of
chichi
s
dagger
thrusts
to
be
converted
into
reality
fortunately
la
romantica
took
herself
off
before
this
antipathy
crystallized
she
was
accustomed
to
pass
the
afternoons
somewhere
outside
and
on
her
return
would
repeat
the
news
gleaned
from
friends
unknown
to
the
rest
of
the
family
this
made
don
marcelo
wax
very
indignant
because
of
the
spies
still
hidden
in
paris
what
mysterious
world
was
his
frequenting
suddenly
she
announced
that
she
was
leaving
the
following
morning
she
had
obtained
a
passport
to
switzerland
and
from
there
she
would
go
to
germany
it
was
high
time
for
her
to
be
returning
to
her
own
she
was
most
appreciative
of
the
hospitality
shown
her
by
the
family
and
desnoyers
bade
her
with
aggressive
irony
his
regards
to
von
hartrott
he
was
hoping
to
pay
him
a
visit
in
berlin
as
soon
as
possible
one
morning
dona
luisa
instead
of
entering
the
neighboring
church
as
usual
continued
on
to
the
rue
de
la
pompe
pleased
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
studio
once
more
it
seemed
to
her
that
in
this
way
she
might
put
herself
more
closely
in
touch
with
her
son
this
would
be
a
new
pleasure
even
greater
than
poring
over
his
photograph
or
his
last
letter
she
was
hoping
to
meet
argensola
the
friend
of
good
counsels
for
she
knew
that
he
was
still
living
in
the
studio
twice
he
had
come
to
see
her
by
the
service
stairway
as
in
the
old
days
but
she
had
been
out
as
she
went
up
in
the
elevator
her
heart
was
palpitating
with
pleasure
and
distress
it
occurred
to
the
good
lady
that
the
foolish
virgins
must
have
had
feelings
like
this
when
for
the
first
time
they
fell
from
the
heights
of
virtue
the
tears
came
to
her
eyes
when
she
beheld
the
room
whose
furnishings
and
pictures
so
vividly
recalled
the
absent
argensola
hastened
from
the
door
at
the
end
of
the
room
agitated
confused
and
greeting
her
with
expressions
of
welcome
at
the
same
time
that
he
was
putting
sundry
objects
out
of
sight
a
woman
s
sweater
lying
on
the
divan
he
covered
with
a
piece
of
oriental
drapery
a
hat
trimmed
with
flowers
he
sent
flying
into
a
corner
dona
luisa
fancied
that
she
saw
a
bit
of
gauzy
feminine
negligee
embroidered
in
pink
flitting
past
the
window
frame
upon
the
divan
were
two
big
coffee
cups
and
bits
of
toast
evidently
left
from
a
double
breakfast
these
artists
the
same
as
her
son
and
she
was
moved
to
compassion
over
the
bad
life
of
julio
s
counsellor
my
honored
dona
luisa
my
dear
madame
desnoyers
he
was
speaking
in
french
and
at
the
top
of
his
voice
looking
frantically
at
the
door
through
which
the
white
and
rosy
garments
had
flitted
he
was
trembling
at
the
thought
that
his
hidden
companion
not
understanding
the
situation
might
in
a
jealous
fit
compromise
him
by
a
sudden
apparition
then
he
spoke
to
his
unexpected
guest
about
the
soldier
exchanging
news
with
her
dona
luisa
repeated
almost
word
for
word
the
paragraphs
of
his
letters
so
frequently
read
argensola
modestly
refrained
from
displaying
his
the
two
friends
were
accustomed
to
an
epistolary
style
which
would
have
made
the
good
lady
blush
a
valiant
man
affirmed
the
spaniard
proudly
looking
upon
the
deeds
of
his
comrade
as
though
they
were
his
own
a
true
hero
and
i
madame
desnoyers
know
something
about
what
that
means
his
chiefs
know
how
to
appreciate
julio
was
a
sergeant
after
having
been
only
two
months
in
the
campaign
the
captain
of
his
company
and
the
other
officials
of
the
regiment
belonged
to
the
fencing
club
in
which
he
had
had
so
many
triumphs
what
a
career
he
enthused
he
is
one
of
those
who
in
youth
reach
the
highest
ranks
like
the
generals
of
the
revolution
and
what
wonders
he
has
accomplished
the
budding
officer
had
merely
referred
in
the
most
casual
way
to
some
of
exploits
with
the
indifference
of
one
accustomed
to
danger
and
expecting
the
same
attitude
from
his
comrades
but
his
chum
exaggerated
them
enlarging
upon
them
as
though
they
were
the
culminating
events
of
the
war
he
had
carried
an
order
across
an
infernal
fire
after
three
messengers
trying
to
accomplish
the
same
feat
had
fallen
dead
he
had
been
the
first
to
attack
many
trenches
and
had
saved
many
of
his
comrades
by
means
of
the
blows
from
his
bayonet
and
hand
to
hand
encounters
whenever
his
superior
officers
needed
a
reliable
man
they
invariably
said
let
sergeant
desnoyers
be
called
he
rattled
off
all
this
as
though
he
had
witnessed
it
as
if
he
had
just
come
from
the
seat
of
war
making
dona
luisa
tremble
and
pour
forth
tears
of
joy
mingled
with
fear
over
the
glories
and
dangers
of
her
son
that
argensola
certainly
possessed
the
gift
of
affecting
his
hearers
by
the
realism
with
which
he
told
his
stories
in
gratitude
for
these
eulogies
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
show
some
interest
in
his
affairs
what
had
he
been
doing
of
late
i
madame
have
been
where
i
ought
to
be
i
have
not
budged
from
this
spot
i
have
witnessed
the
siege
of
in
vain
his
reason
protested
against
the
inexactitude
of
that
word
under
the
influence
of
his
readings
about
the
war
of
he
had
classed
as
a
siege
all
those
events
which
had
developed
near
paris
during
the
course
of
the
battle
of
the
marne
he
pointed
modestly
to
a
diploma
in
a
gold
frame
hanging
above
the
piano
against
a
tricolored
flag
it
was
one
of
the
papers
sold
in
the
streets
a
certificate
of
residence
in
the
capital
during
the
week
of
danger
he
had
filled
in
the
blanks
with
his
name
and
description
of
his
person
and
at
the
foot
were
very
conspicuous
the
signatures
of
two
residents
of
the
rue
de
la
pompe
a
and
a
friend
of
the
concierge
the
district
commissary
of
police
with
stamp
and
seal
had
guaranteed
the
respectability
of
these
honorable
witnesses
nobody
could
remain
in
doubt
after
such
precautions
as
to
whether
he
had
or
had
not
witnessed
the
siege
of
paris
he
had
such
incredulous
friends
in
order
to
bring
the
scene
more
dramatically
before
his
amiable
listener
he
recalled
the
most
striking
of
his
impressions
for
her
special
benefit
once
in
broad
daylight
he
had
seen
a
flock
of
sheep
in
the
boulevard
near
the
madeleine
their
tread
had
resounded
through
the
deserted
streets
like
echoes
from
the
city
of
the
dead
he
was
the
only
pedestrian
on
the
sidewalks
thronged
with
cats
and
dogs
his
military
recollections
excited
him
like
tales
of
glory
i
have
seen
the
march
of
the
soldiers
from
morocco
i
have
seen
the
zouaves
in
automobiles
the
very
night
that
julio
had
gone
to
bordeaux
he
had
wandered
around
till
sunrise
traversing
half
of
paris
from
the
lion
of
belfort
to
the
gare
de
l
est
twenty
thousand
men
with
all
their
campaign
outfit
coming
from
morocco
had
disembarked
at
marseilles
and
arrived
at
the
capital
making
part
of
the
trip
by
rail
and
the
rest
afoot
they
had
come
to
take
part
in
the
great
battle
then
beginning
they
were
troops
composed
of
europeans
and
africans
the
vanguard
on
entering
through
the
orleans
gate
had
swung
into
rhythmic
pace
thus
crossing
half
paris
toward
the
gare
de
l
est
where
the
trains
were
waiting
for
them
the
people
of
paris
had

with

and

colonial
artillerymen
and

from

these
were
professional
warriors
soldiers
who
in
times
of

led
a
life
of
continual
fighting
in
the
colonies
men
with
energetic
profiles
bronzed
faces
and
the
eyes
of
beasts
of
prey
they
had
remained
motionlesss
in
the
streets
for
hours
at
a
time
until
room
could
be
found
for
them
in
the
military
trains
and
argensola
had
followed
this
armed
impassive
mass
of
humanity
from
the
boulevards
talking
with
the
officials
and
listening
to
the
primitive
cries
of
the
african
warriors
who
had
never
seen
paris
and
who
passed
through
it
without
curiosity
asking
where
the
enemy
was
they
had
arrived
in
time
to
attack
von
kluck
on
the
banks
of
the
ourq
obliging
him
to
fall
back
or
be
completely
overwhelmed
a
fact
which
argensola
did
not
relate
to
his
sympathetic
guest
was
that
his
nocturnal
excursion
the
entire
length
of
this
division
of
the
army
had
been
accompanied
by
the
amiable
damsel
within
and
two
other
friends
an
enthusiastic
and
generous
coterie
distributing
flowers
and
kisses
to
the
swarthy
soldiers
and
laughing
at
their
consternation
and
gleaming
white
teeth
another
day
he
had
seen
the
most
extraordinary
of
all
the
spectacles
of
the
war
all
the
taxicabs
some
two
thousand
vehicles
conveying
battalions
of
zouaves
eight
men
to
a
motor
car
had
gone
rolling
past
him
at
full
speed
bristling
with
guns
and
red
caps
they
had
presented
a
most
picturesque
train
in
the
boulevards
like
a
kind
of
interminable
wedding
procession
and
these
soldiers
got
out
of
the
automobiles
on
the
very
edge
of
the
battle
field
opening
fire
the
instant
that
they
leaped
from
the
steps
gallieni
had
launched
all
the
men
who
knew
how
to
handle
a
gun
against
the
extreme
right
of
the
adversary
at
the
supreme
moment
when
the
most
insignificant
weight
might
tip
the
scales
in
favor
of
the
victory
which
was
hanging
in
the
balance
the
clerks
and
secretaries
of
the
military
offices
the
orderlies
of
the
government
and
the
civil
police
all
had
marched
to
give
that
final
push
forming
a
mass
of
heterogenous
colors
and
one
sunday
afternoon
when
with
his
three
companions
of
the
siege
he
was
strolling
with
thousands
of
other
parisians
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
he
had
learned
from
the
extras
that
the
combat
which
had
developed
so
near
to
the
city
was
turning
into
a
great
battle
a
victory
i
have
seen
much
madame
desnoyers
i
can
relate
great
and
she
agreed
with
him
of
course
argensola
had
seen
much
and
on
taking
her
departure
she
offered
him
all
the
assistance
in
her
power
he
was
the
friend
of
her
son
and
she
was
used
to
his
petitions
times
had
changed
don
marcelo
s
generosity
now
knew
no
bounds
but
the
bohemian
interrupted
her
with
a
lordly
gesture
he
was
living
in
luxury
julio
had
made
him
his
trustee
the
draft
from
america
had
been
honored
by
the
bank
as
a
deposit
and
he
had
the
use
of
the
interest
in
accordance
with
the
regulations
of
the
moratorium
his
friend
was
sending
him
regularly
whatever
money
was
needed
for
household
expenses
never
had
he
been
in
such
prosperous
condition
war
had
its
good
side
too
but
not
wishing
to
break
away
from
old
customs
he
announced
that
once
more
he
would
mount
the
service
stairs
in
order
to
bear
away
a
basket
of
bottles
after
her
sister
s
departure
dona
luisa
went
alone
to
the
churches
until
chichi
in
an
outburst
of
devotional
ardor
suddenly
surprised
her
with
the
announcement
mama
i
am
going
with
you
the
new
devotee
was
no
longer
agitating
the
household
by
her
rollicking
boyish
joy
she
was
no
longer
threatening
the
enemy
with
imaginary
dagger
thrusts
she
was
pale
and
with
dark
circles
under
her
eyes
her
head
was
drooping
as
though
weighed
down
with
a
set
of
serious
entirely
new
thoughts
on
the
other
side
of
her
forehead
dona
luisa
observed
her
in
the
church
with
an
almost
indignant
jealousy
her
headstrong
child
s
eyes
were
moist
and
she
was
praying
as
fervently
as
the
mother
but
it
was
surely
not
for
her
brother
julio
had
passed
to
second
place
in
her
remembrance
another
man
was
now
completely
filling
her
thoughts
the
last
of
the
lacours
was
no
longer
a
simple
soldier
nor
was
he
now
in
paris
upon
her
return
from
biarritz
chichi
had
listened
anxiously
to
the
reports
from
her
little
sugar
soldier
throbbing
with
eagerness
she
wanted
to
know
all
about
the
dangers
which
he
had
been
experiencing
and
the
young
warrior
in
the
auxiliary
service
told
her
of
his
restlessness
in
the
office
during
the
interminable
days
in
which
the
troops
were
battling
around
paris
hearing
afar
off
the
boom
of
the
artillery
his
father
had
wished
to
take
him
with
him
to
bordeaux
but
the
administrative
confusion
of
the
last
hour
had
kept
him
in
the
capital
he
had
done
something
more
on
the
day
of
the
great
crisis
when
the
acting
governor
had
sent
out
all
the
available
men
in
automobiles
he
had
unasked
seized
a
gun
and
occupied
a
motor
with
others
from
his
office
he
had
not
seen
anything
more
than
smoke
burning
houses
and
wounded
men
not
a
single
german
had
passed
before
his
eyes
excepting
a
band
of
uhlan
prisoners
but
for
some
hours
he
had
been
shooting
on
the
edge
of
the
road
and
nothing
more
for
a
while
that
was
enough
for
chichi
she
felt
very
proud
to
be
the
betrothed
of
a
hero
of
the
marne
even
though
his
intervention
had
lasted
but
a
few
hours
in
a
few
days
however
her
enthusiasm
became
rather
clouded
it
was
becoming
annoying
to
stroll
through
the
streets
with
rene
a
simple
soldier
and
in
the
auxiliary
service
besides
the
women
of
the
town
excited
by
the
recollection
of
their
men
fighting
at
the
front
or
clad
in
mourning
because
of
the
death
of
some
loved
one
would
look
at
them
with
aggressive
insolence
the
refinement
and
elegance
of
the
republican
prince
seemed
to
irritate
them
several
times
she
overheard
uncomplimentary
words
hurled
against
the
the
fact
that
her
brother
who
was
not
french
was
in
the
thick
of
the
fighting
made
the
lacour
situation
still
more
intolerable
she
had
an
embusque
for
a
lover
how
her
friends
would
laugh
at
her
the
senator
s
son
soon
read
her
thoughts
and
began
to
lose
some
of
his
smiling
serenity
for
three
days
he
did
not
present
himself
at
the
desnoyers
home
and
they
all
supposed
that
he
was
detained
by
work
at
the
office
one
morning
as
chichi
was
going
toward
the
bois
de
boulogne
escorted
by
one
of
the
maids
she
noticed
a
soldier
coming
toward
her
he
was
wearing
a
bright
uniform
of
the
new
the
horizon
blue
just
adopted
by
the
french
army
the
chin
strap
of
his
kepi
was
gilt
and
on
his
sleeve
there
was
a
little
strip
of
gold
his
smile
his
outstretched
hands
the
confidence
with
which
he
advanced
toward
her
made
her
recognize
him
rene
an
officer
her
betrothed
a
yes
of
course
i
could
do
nothing
else
i
had
heard
enough
without
his
father
s
knowledge
and
assisted
by
his
friends
he
had
in
a
few
days
wrought
this
wonderful
transformation
as
a
graduate
of
the
ecole
centrale
he
held
the
rank
of
a
of
the
reserve
artillery
and
he
had
requested
to
be
sent
to
the
front
to
the
auxiliary
service
within
two
days
he
was
going
to
start
for
the
war
you
have
done
this
exclaimed
chichi
you
have
done
this
although
very
pale
she
gazed
fondly
at
him
with
her
great
eyes
eyes
that
seemed
to
devour
him
with
admiration
come
here
my
poor
boy
come
here
my
sweet
little
soldier
i
owe
you
and
turning
her
back
on
the
maid
she
asked
him
to
come
with
her
round
the
corner
it
was
just
the
same
there
the
cross
street
was
just
as
thronged
as
the
avenue
but
what
did
she
care
for
the
stare
of
the
curious
rapturously
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
blind
and
insensible
to
everything
and
everybody
but
him
there
there
and
she
planted
on
his
face
two
vehement
sonorous
aggressive
kisses
then
trembling
and
shuddering
she
suddenly
weakened
and
fumbling
for
her
handkerchief
broke
down
in
desperate
weeping
chapter
ii
in
the
studio
upon
opening
the
studio
door
one
afternoon
argensola
stood
motionless
with
surprise
as
though
rooted
to
the
ground
an
old
gentleman
was
greeting
him
with
an
amiable
smile
i
am
the
father
of
and
he
walked
into
the
apartment
with
the
confidence
of
a
man
entirely
familiar
with
his
surroundings
by
good
luck
the
artist
was
alone
and
was
not
obliged
to
tear
frantically
from
one
end
of
the
room
to
the
other
hiding
the
traces
of
convivial
company
but
he
was
a
little
slow
in
regaining
his
he
had
heard
so
much
about
don
marcelo
and
his
bad
temper
that
he
was
very
uncomfortable
at
this
unexpected
appearance
in
the
studio
what
could
the
fearful
man
want
his
tranquillity
was
restored
after
a
furtive
appraising
glance
his
friend
s
father
had
aged
greatly
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
he
no
longer
had
that
air
of
tenacity
and
that
had
made
him
unapproachable
his
eyes
were
sparkling
with
childish
glee
his
hands
were
trembling
slightly
and
his
back
was
bent
argensola
who
had
always
dodged
him
in
the
street
and
had
thrilled
with
fear
when
sneaking
up
the
stairway
in
the
avenue
home
now
felt
a
sudden
confidence
the
transformed
old
man
was
beaming
on
him
like
a
comrade
and
making
excuses
to
justify
his
visit
he
had
wished
to
see
his
son
s
home
poor
old
man
he
was
drawn
thither
by
the
same
attraction
which
leads
the
lover
to
lessen
his
solitude
by
haunting
the
places
that
his
beloved
has
frequented
the
letters
from
julio
were
not
enough
he
needed
to
see
his
old
abode
to
be
on
familiar
terms
with
the
objects
which
had
surrounded
him
to
breathe
the
same
air
to
chat
with
the
young
man
who
was
his
boon
companion
his
fatherly
glance
now
included
argensola
a
very
interesting
fellow
that
argensola
and
as
he
thought
this
he
forgot
completely
that
without
knowing
him
he
had
been
accustomed
to
refer
to
him
as
shameless
just
because
he
was
sharing
his
son
s
prodigal
life
desnoyers
glance
roamed
delightedly
around
the
studio
he
knew
well
these
tapestries
and
furnishings
all
the
decorations
of
the
former
owner
he
easily
remembered
everything
that
he
had
ever
bought
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
so
many
his
eyes
then
sought
the
personal
effects
everything
that
would
call
the
absent
occupant
to
mind
and
he
pored
over
the
miserably
executed
paintings
the
unfinished
dabs
which
filled
all
the
corners
were
they
all
julio
s
many
of
the
canvases
belonged
to
argensola
but
affected
by
the
old
man
s
emotion
the
artist
displayed
a
marvellous
generosity
yes
everything
was
julio
s
handiwork
and
the
father
went
from
canvas
to
canvas
halting
admiringly
before
the
vaguest
daubs
as
though
he
could
almost
detect
signs
of
genius
in
their
nebulous
confusion
you
think
he
has
talent
really
he
asked
in
a
tone
that
implored
a
favorable
reply
i
always
thought
him
very
intelligent
a
little
of
the
diable
perhaps
but
character
changes
with
years
now
he
is
an
altogether
different
and
he
almost
wept
at
hearing
the
spaniard
with
his
ready
enthusiastic
speech
lauding
the
departed
diable
graphically
setting
forth
the
way
in
which
his
great
genius
was
going
to
take
the
world
when
his
turn
should
come
the
painter
of
souls
finally
worked
himself
up
into
feeling
as
much
affected
as
the
father
and
began
to
admire
this
old
frenchman
with
a
certain
remorse
not
wishing
to
remember
how
he
had
ranted
against
him
not
so
very
long
ago
what
injustice
don
marcelo
clasped
his
hand
like
an
old
comrade
all
of
his
son
s
friends
were
his
friends
he
knew
the
life
that
young
men
lived
if
at
any
time
he
should
be
in
any
difficulties
if
he
needed
an
allowance
so
as
to
keep
on
with
his
painting
there
he
was
anxious
to
help
him
he
then
and
there
invited
him
to
dine
at
his
home
that
very
night
and
if
he
would
care
to
come
every
evening
so
much
the
better
he
would
eat
a
family
dinner
entirely
informal
war
had
brought
about
a
great
many
changes
but
he
would
always
be
as
welcome
to
the
intimacy
of
the
hearth
as
though
he
were
in
his
father
s
home
then
he
spoke
of
spain
in
order
to
place
himself
on
a
more
congenial
footing
with
the
artist
he
had
never
been
there
but
once
and
then
only
for
a
short
time
but
after
the
war
he
was
going
to
know
it
better
his
was
a
spaniard
his
wife
had
spanish
blood
and
in
his
home
the
language
of
the
family
was
always
castilian
ah
spain
the
country
with
a
noble
past
and
illustrious
men
argensola
had
a
strong
suspicion
that
if
he
had
been
a
native
of
any
other
land
the
old
gentleman
would
have
praised
it
in
the
same
way
all
this
affection
was
but
a
reflex
of
his
love
for
his
absent
son
but
it
so
pleased
the
impressionable
fellow
that
he
almost
embraced
don
marcelo
when
he
took
his
departure
after
that
his
visits
to
the
studio
were
very
frequent
the
artist
was
obliged
to
recommend
his
friends
to
take
a
good
long
walk
after
lunch
abstaining
from
reappearing
in
the
rue
de
la
pompe
until
nightfall
sometimes
however
don
marcelo
would
unexpectedly
present
himself
in
the
morning
and
then
the
soulful
impressionist
would
have
to
scurry
from
place
to
place
hiding
here
concealing
there
in
order
that
his
workroom
should
preserve
its
appearance
of
virtuous
labor
youth
youth
the
visitor
would
murmur
with
a
smile
of
tolerance
and
he
actually
had
to
make
an
effort
to
recall
the
dignity
of
his
years
in
order
not
to
ask
argensola
to
present
him
to
the
fair
fugitives
whose
presence
he
suspected
in
the
interior
rooms
perhaps
they
had
been
his
boy
s
friends
too
they
represented
a
part
of
his
past
anyway
and
that
was
enough
to
make
him
presume
that
they
had
great
charms
which
made
them
interesting
these
surprises
with
their
upsetting
consequences
finally
made
the
painter
rather
regret
this
new
friendship
and
the
invitations
to
dinner
which
he
was
constantly
receiving
bored
him
too
he
found
the
desnoyers
table
most
excellent
but
too
tedious
for
the
father
and
mother
could
talk
of
nothing
but
their
absent
son
chichi
scarcely
looked
at
her
brother
s
friend
her
attention
was
entirely
concentrated
on
the
war
the
irregularity
in
the
mails
was
exasperating
her
so
that
she
began
composing
protests
to
the
government
whenever
a
few
days
passed
by
without
bringing
any
letter
from
lacour
argensola
excused
himself
on
various
pretexts
from
continuing
to
dine
in
the
avenue
victor
hugo
it
pleased
him
far
more
to
haunt
the
cheap
restaurants
with
his
female
flock
his
host
accepted
his
negatives
with
resignation
not
either
and
in
order
to
compensate
for
his
guest
s
he
would
present
himself
at
the
studio
earlier
than
ever
on
the
day
following
it
was
an
exquisite
pleasure
for
the
doting
father
to
let
the
time
slip
by
seated
on
the
divan
which
still
seemed
to
guard
the
very
hollow
made
by
julio
s
body
gazing
at
the
canvases
covered
with
color
by
his
brush
toasting
his
toes
by
the
beat
of
a
stove
which
roared
so
cosily
in
the
profound
conventual
silence
it
certainly
was
an
agreeable
refuge
full
of
memories
in
the
midst
of
monotonous
paris
so
saddened
by
the
war
that
he
could
not
meet
a
friend
who
was
not
preoccupied
with
his
own
troubles
his
former
purchasing
dissipations
had
now
lost
all
charm
for
him
the
hotel
drouot
no
longer
tempted
him
at
that
time
the
goods
of
german
residents
seized
by
the
government
were
being
auctioned
off
a
felicitous
retaliation
for
the
enforced
journey
which
the
fittings
of
the
castle
of
villeblanche
had
taken
on
the
road
to
berlin
but
the
agents
told
him
in
vain
of
the
few
competitors
which
he
would
now
meet
he
no
longer
felt
attracted
by
these
extraordinary
bargains
why
buy
anything
more
of
what
use
was
such
useless
stuff
whenever
he
thought
of
the
hard
life
of
millions
of
men
in
the
open
field
he
felt
a
longing
to
lead
an
ascetic
life
he
was
beginning
to
hate
the
ostentatious
splendors
of
his
home
on
the
avenue
victor
hugo
he
now
recalled
without
a
regretful
pang
the
destruction
of
the
castle
no
he
was
far
better
off
there
and
there
was
always
the
studio
of
julio
argensola
began
to
form
the
habit
of
working
in
the
presence
of
don
marcelo
he
knew
that
the
resolute
soul
abominated
inactive
people
so
under
the
contagious
influence
of
dominant
he
began
several
new
pieces
desnoyers
would
follow
with
interest
the
motions
of
his
brush
and
accept
all
the
explanations
of
the
soulful
delineator
for
himself
he
always
preferred
the
old
masters
and
in
his
bargains
had
acquired
the
work
of
many
a
dead
artist
but
the
fact
that
julio
had
thought
as
his
partner
did
was
now
enough
for
the
devotee
of
the
antique
and
made
him
admit
humbly
all
the
spaniard
s
superior
theories
the
artist
s
laborious
zeal
was
always
of
short
duration
after
a
few
moments
he
always
found
that
he
preferred
to
rest
on
the
divan
and
converse
with
his
guest
the
first
subject
of
course
was
the
absentee
they
would
repeat
fragments
of
the
letters
they
had
received
and
would
speak
of
the
past
with
the
most
discreet
allusions
the
painter
described
julio
s
life
before
the
war
as
an
existence
dedicated
completely
to
art
the
father
ignored
the
inexactitude
of
such
words
and
gratefully
accepted
the
lie
as
a
proof
of
friendship
argensola
was
such
a
clever
comrade
never
in
his
loftiest
verbal
flights
making
the
slightest
reference
to
madame
laurier
the
old
gentleman
was
often
thinking
about
her
nowadays
for
he
had
seen
her
in
the
street
giving
her
arm
to
her
husband
now
recovered
from
his
wounds
the
illustrious
lacour
had
informed
him
with
great
satisfaction
of
their
reconciliation
the
engineer
had
lost
but
one
eye
now
he
was
again
at
the
head
of
his
factory
requisitioned
by
the
government
for
the
manufacture
of
shells
he
was
a
captain
and
was
wearing
two
decorations
of
honor
the
senator
did
not
know
exactly
how
this
unexpected
agreement
had
come
about
he
had
one
day
seen
them
coming
home
together
looking
affectionately
at
each
other
in
complete
oblivion
of
the
past
who
remembers
things
that
happened
before
the
war
said
the
politic
sage
they
and
their
friends
have
completely
forgotten
all
about
their
divorce
nowadays
we
are
all
living
a
new
existence
i
believe
that
the
two
are
happier
than
ever
desnoyers
had
had
a
presentiment
of
this
happiness
when
he
saw
them
together
and
the
man
of
inflexible
morality
who
was
the
year
before
anathematizing
his
son
s
behavior
toward
laurier
considering
it
the
most
unpardonable
of
his
adventures
now
felt
a
certain
indignation
in
seeing
marguerite
devoted
to
her
husband
and
talking
to
him
with
such
affectionate
interest
this
matrimonial
felicity
seemed
to
him
like
the
basest
ingratitude
a
woman
who
had
had
such
an
influence
over
the
life
of
julio
could
she
thus
easily
forget
her
love
the
two
had
passed
on
as
though
they
did
not
recognize
him
perhaps
captain
laurier
did
not
see
very
clearly
but
she
had
looked
at
him
frankly
and
then
hastily
averted
her
eyes
so
as
to
evade
his
greeting
the
old
man
felt
sad
over
such
indifference
not
on
his
own
account
but
on
his
son
s
poor
julio
the
unbending
parent
in
complete
mental
immorality
found
himself
lamenting
this
indifference
as
something
monstrous
the
war
was
the
other
topic
of
conversation
during
the
afternoons
passed
in
the
studio
argensola
was
not
now
stuffing
his
pockets
with
printed
sheets
as
at
the
beginning
of
hostilities
a
serene
and
resigned
calm
had
succeeded
the
excitement
of
those
first
moments
when
the
people
were
daily
looking
for
miraculous
interventions
all
the
periodicals
were
saying
about
the
same
thing
he
was
content
with
the
official
report
and
he
had
learned
to
wait
for
that
document
without
impatience
foreseeing
that
with
but
few
exceptions
it
would
say
the
same
thing
as
the
day
before
the
fever
of
the
first
months
with
its
illusions
and
optimisms
now
appeared
to
argensola
somewhat
chimerical
those
not
actually
engaged
in
the
war
were
returning
gradually
to
their
habitual
occupations
life
had
recovered
its
regular
rhythm
one
must
live
said
the
people
and
the
struggle
for
existence
filled
their
thoughts
with
its
immediate
urgency
those
whose
relatives
were
in
the
army
were
still
thinking
of
them
but
their
occupations
were
so
blunting
the
edge
of
memory
that
they
were
becoming
accustomed
to
their
absence
regarding
the
unusual
as
the
normal
condition
at
first
the
war
made
sleep
out
of
the
question
food
impossible
to
swallow
and
embittered
every
pleasure
with
its
funereal
pall
now
the
shops
were
slowly
opening
money
was
in
circulation
and
people
were
able
to
laugh
they
talked
of
the
great
calamity
but
only
at
certain
hours
as
something
that
was
going
to
be
long
very
long
and
would
exact
great
resignation
to
its
inevitable
fatalism
humanity
accustoms
itself
easily
to
trouble
said
argensola
provided
that
the
trouble
lasts
long
enough
in
this
lies
our
don
marcelo
was
not
in
sympathy
with
the
general
resignation
the
war
was
going
to
be
much
shorter
than
they
were
all
imagining
his
enthusiasm
had
settled
on
a
speedy
termination
within
the
next
three
months
the
next
spring
probably
if
peace
were
not
declared
in
the
spring
it
surely
would
be
in
the
summer
a
new
talker
took
part
in
these
conversations
desnoyers
had
become
acquainted
with
the
russian
neighbor
of
whom
argensola
had
so
frequently
spoken
since
this
odd
personage
had
also
known
his
son
that
was
enough
to
make
tchernoff
arouse
his
interest
in
normal
times
he
would
have
kept
him
at
a
distance
the
millionaire
was
a
great
believer
in
law
and
order
he
abominated
revolutionists
with
the
instinctive
fear
of
all
the
rich
who
have
built
up
a
fortune
and
remember
their
humble
beginnings
tchernoff
s
socialism
and
nationality
brought
vividly
to
his
mind
a
series
of
feverish
images
bombs
daggers
stabbings
deserved
expiations
on
the
gallows
and
exile
to
siberia
no
he
was
not
desirable
as
a
friend
but
now
don
marcelo
was
experiencing
an
abrupt
reversal
of
his
convictions
regarding
alien
ideas
he
had
seen
so
much
the
revolting
proceedings
of
the
invasion
the
unscrupulous
methods
of
the
german
chiefs
the
tranquillity
with
which
their
submarines
were
sinking
boats
filled
with
defenseless
passengers
the
deeds
of
the
aviators
who
were
hurling
bombs
upon
unguarded
cities
destroying
women
and
children
all
this
was
causing
the
events
of
revolutionary
terrorism
which
years
ago
used
to
arouse
his
wrath
to
sink
into
relative
unimportance
and
to
think
he
said
that
we
used
to
be
as
infuriated
as
though
the
world
were
coming
to
an
end
just
because
someone
threw
a
bomb
at
a
grandee
those
titled
victims
had
had
certain
reprehensible
qualities
which
had
justified
their
execution
they
had
died
in
consequence
of
acts
which
they
undertook
knowing
well
what
the
punishment
would
be
they
had
brought
retribution
on
themselves
without
trying
to
evade
it
rarely
taking
any
precautions
while
the
terrorists
of
this
war
with
the
violence
of
his
imperious
character
the
old
conservative
now
swung
to
the
opposite
extreme
the
true
anarchists
are
yet
on
top
he
said
with
an
ironical
laugh
those
who
terrified
us
formerly
all
put
together
were
but
a
few
miserable
creatures
in
a
few
seconds
these
of
our
day
kill
more
innocent
people
than
those
others
did
in
thirty
the
gentleness
of
tchernoff
his
original
ideas
his
incoherencies
of
thought
bounding
from
reflection
to
word
without
any
preparation
finally
won
don
marcelo
so
completely
over
that
he
formed
the
habit
of
consulting
him
about
all
his
doubts
his
admiration
made
him
too
overlook
the
source
of
certain
bottles
with
which
argensola
sometimes
treated
his
neighbor
he
was
delighted
to
have
tchernoff
consume
these
souvenirs
of
the
time
when
he
was
living
at
swords
points
with
his
son
after
sampling
the
wine
from
the
avenue
victor
hugo
the
russian
would
indulge
in
a
visionary
loquacity
similar
to
that
of
the
night
when
he
evoked
the
fantastic
cavalcade
of
the
four
horsemen
of
the
apocalypse
what
his
new
convert
most
admired
was
his
facility
for
making
things
clear
and
fixing
them
in
the
imagination
the
battle
of
the
marne
with
its
subsequent
combats
and
the
course
of
both
armies
were
events
easily
explained
if
the
french
only
had
not
been
so
fatigued
after
their
triumph
of
the
marne
but
human
powers
continued
tchernoff
have
their
limits
and
the
french
soldier
with
all
his
enthusiasm
is
a
man
like
the
rest
in
the
first
place
the
most
rapid
of
marches
from
the
east
to
the
north
in
order
to
resist
the
invasion
of
belgium
then
the
combats
then
the
swift
retreat
that
they
might
not
be
surrounded
finally
a
seven
days
battle
and
all
this
in
a
period
of
three
weeks
no
more
in
their
moment
of
triumph
the
victors
lacked
the
legs
to
follow
up
their
advantage
and
they
lacked
the
cavalry
to
pursue
the
fugitives
their
beasts
were
even
more
exhausted
than
the
men
when
those
who
were
retreating
found
that
they
were
being
spurred
on
with
lessening
tenacity
they
had
stretched
themselves
with
fatigue
on
the
field
excavating
the
ground
and
forming
a
refuge
for
themselves
the
french
also
flung
themselves
down
scraping
the
soil
together
so
as
not
to
lose
what
they
had
gained
and
in
this
way
began
the
war
of
the
then
each
line
with
the
intention
of
wrapping
itself
around
that
of
the
enemy
had
gone
on
prolonging
itself
toward
the
northeast
and
from
these
successive
stretchings
had
resulted
the
double
course
toward
the
sea
forming
the
greatest
battle
front
ever
known
to
history
when
don
marcelo
with
optimistic
enthusiasm
announced
the
end
of
the
war
in
the
following
spring
or
summer
in
four
months
at
the
outside
the
russian
shook
his
head
it
will
be
long
very
long
it
is
a
new
war
the
genuine
modern
warfare
the
germans
began
hostilities
in
the
old
way
as
though
they
had
observed
nothing
since
a
war
of
involved
movements
of
battles
in
the
open
field
the
same
as
moltke
might
have
planned
imitating
napoleon
they
were
desirous
of
bringing
it
to
a
speedy
conclusion
and
were
sure
of
triumph
why
employ
new
methods
but
the
encounter
of
the
marne
twisted
their
plans
making
them
shift
from
the
aggressive
to
the
defensive
they
then
brought
into
service
all
that
the
war
staff
had
learned
in
the
campaigns
of
the
japanese
and
russians
beginning
the
war
of
the
trenches
the
subterranean
struggle
which
is
the
logical
outcome
of
the
reach
and
number
of
shots
of
the
modern
armament
the
conquest
of
half
a
mile
of
territory
stands
for
more
than
did
the
assault
of
a
stone
fortress
a
century
ago
neither
side
is
going
to
make
any
headway
for
a
long
time
perhaps
they
may
never
make
a
definite
advance
the
war
is
bound
to
be
long
and
tedious
like
the
athletic
conquests
between
opponents
who
are
equally
but
it
will
have
to
come
to
an
end
sometime
interpolated
desnoyers
undoubtedly
but
who
knows
when
and
in
what
condition
will
they
both
be
when
it
is
all
over
he
was
counting
upon
a
rapid
finale
when
it
was
least
expected
through
the
exhaustion
of
one
of
the
contestants
carefully
dissimulated
until
the
last
moment
germany
will
be
vanquished
he
added
with
firm
conviction
i
do
not
know
when
nor
how
but
she
will
fall
logically
she
failed
in
her
in
not
entering
paris
and
overcoming
its
opposition
all
the
trumps
in
her
pack
of
cards
were
then
played
she
did
not
win
but
continues
playing
the
game
because
she
holds
many
cards
and
she
will
prolong
it
for
a
long
time
to
come
but
what
she
could
not
do
at
first
she
will
never
be
able
to
for
tchernoff
the
final
defeat
did
not
mean
the
destruction
of
germany
nor
the
annihilation
of
the
german
people
excessive
patriotism
irritates
me
he
pursued
hearing
people
form
plans
for
the
definite
extinction
of
germany
seems
to
me
like
listening
to
the
of
berlin
when
they
talk
of
dividing
up
the
then
he
summed
up
his
opinion
imperialism
will
have
to
be
crushed
for
the
sake
of
the
tranquillity
of
the
world
the
great
war
machine
which
menaces
the
peace
of
nations
will
have
to
be
suppressed
since
we
have
all
been
living
in
dread
of
it
for
forty
years
the
war
has
been
averted
but
in
all
that
time
what
apprehension
what
was
most
irritating
tchernoff
was
the
moral
lesson
born
of
this
situation
which
had
ended
by
overwhelming
the
world
the
glorification
of
power
the
sanctification
of
success
the
triumph
of
materialism
the
respect
for
the
accomplished
fact
the
mockery
of
the
noblest
sentiments
as
though
they
were
merely
sonorous
and
absurd
phrases
the
reversal
of
moral
values
a
philosophy
of
bandits
which
pretended
to
be
the
last
word
of
progress
and
was
no
more
than
a
return
to
despotism
violence
and
the
barbarity
of
the
most
primitive
epochs
of
history
while
he
was
longing
for
the
suppression
of
the
representatives
of
this
tendency
he
would
not
therefore
demand
the
extermination
of
the
german
people
this
nation
has
great
merits
jumbled
with
bad
conditions
inherited
from
a
not
barbarous
past
it
possesses
the
genius
of
organization
and
work
and
is
able
to
lend
great
service
to
humanity
but
first
it
is
necessary
to
give
it
a
douche
the
douche
of
downfall
the
germans
are
mad
with
pride
and
their
madness
threatens
the
security
of
the
world
when
those
who
have
poisoned
them
with
the
illusion
of
universal
hegemony
have
disappeared
when
misfortune
has
freshened
their
imagination
and
transformed
them
into
a
community
of
humans
neither
superior
nor
inferior
to
the
rest
of
mankind
they
will
become
a
tolerant
people
useful
and
who
knows
but
they
may
even
prove
sympathetic
according
to
tchernoff
there
was
not
in
existence
a
more
dangerous
nation
its
political
organization
was
converting
it
into
a
warrior
horde
educated
by
kicks
and
submitted
to
continual
humiliations
in
order
that
the
willpower
which
always
resists
discipline
might
be
completely
nullified
it
is
a
nation
where
all
receive
blows
and
desire
to
give
them
to
those
lower
down
the
kick
that
the
kaiser
gives
is
transmitted
from
back
to
back
down
to
the
lowest
rung
of
the
social
ladder
the
blows
begin
in
the
school
and
are
continued
in
the
barracks
forming
part
of
the
education
the
apprenticeship
of
the
prussian
crown
princes
has
always
consisted
in
receiving
fisticuffs
and
cowhidings
from
their
progenitor
the
king
the
kaiser
beats
his
children
the
officer
his
soldiers
the
father
his
wife
and
children
the
schoolmaster
his
pupils
and
when
the
superior
is
not
able
to
give
blows
he
subjects
those
under
him
to
the
torment
of
moral
on
this
account
when
they
abandoned
their
ordinary
avocations
taking
up
arms
in
order
to
fall
upon
another
human
group
they
did
so
with
implacable
ferocity
each
one
of
them
continued
the
russian
carries
on
his
back
the
marks
of
kicks
and
when
his
turn
comes
he
seeks
consolation
in
passing
them
on
to
the
unhappy
creatures
whom
war
puts
into
his
power
this
nation
of
as
they
love
to
call
themselves
aspires
to
lordship
but
outside
of
the
country
within
it
are
the
ones
who
least
appreciate
human
dignity
and
therefore
long
vehemently
to
spread
their
dominant
will
over
the
face
of
the
earth
passing
from
lackeys
to
suddenly
don
marcelo
stopped
going
with
such
frequency
to
the
studio
he
was
now
haunting
the
home
and
office
of
the
senator
because
this
friend
had
upset
his
tranquillity
lacour
had
been
much
depressed
since
the
heir
to
the
family
glory
had
broken
through
the
protecting
paternal
net
in
order
to
go
to
war
one
night
while
dining
with
the
desnoyers
family
an
idea
popped
into
his
head
which
filled
him
with
delight
would
you
like
to
see
your
son
he
needed
to
see
rene
and
had
begun
negotiating
for
a
permit
from
headquarters
which
would
allow
him
to
visit
the
front
his
son
belonged
to
the
same
army
division
as
julio
perhaps
their
camps
were
rather
far
apart
but
an
automobile
makes
many
revolutions
before
it
reaches
the
end
of
its
journey
it
was
not
necessary
to
say
more
desnoyers
instantly
felt
the
most
overmastering
desire
to
see
his
boy
since
for
so
many
months
he
had
had
to
content
himself
with
reading
his
letters
and
studying
the
snap
shot
which
one
of
his
comrades
had
made
of
his
soldier
son
from
that
time
on
he
besieged
the
senator
as
though
he
were
a
political
supporter
desiring
an
office
he
visited
him
in
the
mornings
in
his
home
invited
him
to
dinner
every
evening
and
hunted
him
down
in
the
salons
of
the
luxembourg
before
the
first
word
of
greeting
could
be
exchanged
his
eyes
were
formulating
the
same
interrogation
when
will
you
get
that
permit
the
great
man
could
only
reply
by
lamenting
the
indifference
of
the
military
department
toward
the
civilian
element
it
always
had
been
inimical
toward
parliamentarism
besides
joffre
is
showing
himself
most
unapproachable
he
does
not
encourage
the
curious
i
will
see
the
a
few
days
later
he
arrived
at
the
house
in
the
avenue
victor
hugo
with
an
expression
of
radiant
satisfaction
that
filled
don
marcelo
with
joy
it
has
come
it
has
come
we
start
the
day
after
desnoyers
went
the
following
afternoon
to
the
studio
in
the
rue
de
la
pompe
i
am
going
the
artist
was
very
eager
to
accompany
him
would
it
not
be
possible
for
him
to
go
too
as
secretary
to
the
senator
don
marcelo
smiled
benevolently
the
authorization
was
only
for
lacour
and
one
companion
he
was
the
one
who
was
going
to
pose
as
secretary
valet
or
utility
man
to
his
future
at
the
end
of
the
afternoon
he
left
the
studio
accompanied
to
the
elevator
by
the
lamentations
of
argensola
to
think
that
he
could
not
join
that
expedition
he
believed
that
he
had
lost
the
opportunity
to
paint
his
masterpiece
just
outside
of
his
home
he
met
tchernoff
don
marcelo
was
in
high
good
humor
the
certainty
that
he
was
soon
going
to
see
his
son
filled
him
with
boyish
good
spirits
he
almost
embraced
the
russian
in
spite
of
his
slovenly
aspect
his
tragic
beard
and
his
enormous
hat
which
made
every
one
turn
to
look
after
him
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
the
arc
de
triomphe
stood
forth
against
a
sky
crimsoned
by
the
sunset
a
red
cloud
was
floating
around
the
monument
reflected
on
its
whiteness
with
purpling
palpitations
desnoyers
recalled
the
four
horsemen
and
all
that
argensola
had
told
him
before
presenting
him
to
the
russian
blood
shouted
jubilantly
all
the
sky
seems
to
be
it
is
the
apocalyptic
beast
who
has
received
his
soon
we
shall
see
him
tchernoff
smiled
too
but
his
was
a
melancholy
smile
no
the
beast
does
not
die
it
is
the
eternal
companion
of
man
it
hides
spouting
blood
forty
sixty
a
hundred
years
but
eventually
it
reappears
all
that
we
can
hope
is
that
its
wound
may
be
long
and
deep
that
it
may
remain
hidden
so
long
that
the
generation
that
now
remembers
it
may
never
see
it
chapter
iii
war
don
marcelo
was
climbing
up
a
mountain
covered
with
woods
the
forest
presented
a
tragic
desolation
a
silent
tempest
had
installed
itself
therein
placing
everything
in
violent
unnatural
positions
not
a
single
tree
still
preserved
its
upright
form
and
abundant
foliage
as
in
the
days
of
peace
the
groups
of
pines
recalled
the
columns
of
ruined
temples
some
were
still
standing
erect
but
without
their
crowns
like
shafts
that
might
have
lost
their
capitals
others
were
pierced
like
the
mouthpiece
of
a
flute
or
like
pillars
struck
by
a
thunderbolt
some
had
splintery
threads
hanging
around
their
cuts
like
used
toothpicks
a
sinister
force
of
destruction
had
been
raging
among
these
beeches
spruce
and
oaks
great
tangles
of
their
cut
boughs
were
cluttering
the
ground
as
though
a
band
of
gigantic
woodcutters
had
just
passed
by
the
trunks
had
been
severed
a
little
distance
from
the
ground
with
a
clean
and
glistening
stroke
as
though
with
a
single
blow
of
the
axe
around
the
disinterred
roots
were
quantities
of
stones
mixed
with
sod
stones
that
had
been
sleeping
in
the
recesses
of
the
earth
and
had
been
brought
to
the
surface
by
explosions
at
intervals
gleaming
among
the
trees
or
blocking
the
roadway
with
an
importunity
which
required
some
zigzagging
was
a
series
of
pools
all
alike
of
regular
geometrical
circles
to
desnoyers
they
seemed
like
sunken
basins
for
the
use
of
the
invisible
titans
who
had
been
hewing
the
forest
their
great
depth
extended
to
their
very
edges
a
swimmer
might
dive
into
these
lagoons
without
ever
touching
bottom
their
water
was
greenish
still
water
rain
water
with
a
scum
of
vegetation
perforated
by
the
respiratory
bubbles
of
the
little
organisms
coming
to
life
in
its
vitals
bordering
the
hilly
pathway
through
the
pines
were
many
mounds
with
crosses
of
wood
tombs
of
french
soldiers
topped
with
little
tricolored
flags
upon
these
graves
were
the
old
kepis
of
the
gunners
the
ferocious
in
destroying
this
woods
had
also
blindly
demolished
many
of
the
ants
swarming
around
the
trunks
don
marcelo
was
wearing
leggings
a
broad
hat
and
on
his
shoulders
a
fine
poncho
arranged
like
a
shawl
garments
which
recalled
his
life
on
the
ranch
behind
him
came
lacour
trying
to
preserve
his
senatorial
dignity
in
spite
of
his
gasps
and
puffs
of
fatigue
he
also
was
wearing
high
boots
and
a
soft
hat
but
he
had
kept
to
his
solemn
in
order
not
to
abandon
entirely
his
parliamentary
uniform
before
them
marched
two
captains
as
guides
they
were
on
a
mountain
occupied
by
the
french
artillery
and
were
climbing
to
the
top
where
were
hidden
cannons
and
cannons
forming
a
line
some
miles
in
length
the
german
artillery
had
caused
the
woodland
ruin
around
the
visitors
in
their
return
of
the
french
fire
the
circular
pools
were
the
hollows
dug
by
the
german
shells
in
the
limy
soil
which
preserved
all
the
runnels
of
rain
the
visiting
party
had
left
their
automobile
at
the
foot
of
the
mountain
one
of
the
officers
a
former
artilleryman
explained
this
precaution
to
them
it
was
necessary
to
climb
this
roadway
very
cautiously
they
were
within
reach
of
the
enemy
and
an
automobile
might
attract
the
attention
of
their
gunners
a
little
fatiguing
this
climb
he
continued
courage
senator
lacour
we
are
almost
they
began
to
meet
artillerymen
many
of
them
not
in
uniform
but
wearing
the
military
kepis
they
looked
like
workmen
from
a
metal
factory
foundrymen
with
jackets
and
pantaloons
of
corduroy
their
arms
were
bare
and
some
had
put
on
wooden
shoes
in
order
to
get
over
the
mud
with
greater
security
they
were
former
iron
laborers
mobilized
into
the
artillery
reserves
their
sergeants
had
been
factory
overseers
and
many
of
them
officials
engineers
and
proprietors
of
big
workshops
suddenly
the
excursionists
stumbled
upon
the
iron
inmates
of
the
woods
when
these
spoke
the
earth
trembled
the
air
shuddered
and
the
native
inhabitants
of
the
forest
the
crows
rabbits
butterflies
and
ants
fled
in
terrified
flight
trying
to
hide
themselves
from
the
fearful
convulsion
which
seemed
to
be
bringing
the
world
to
an
end
just
at
present
the
bellowing
monsters
were
silent
so
that
they
came
upon
them
unexpectedly
something
was
sticking
up
out
of
the
greenery
like
a
gray
beam
at
other
times
this
apparition
would
emerge
from
a
conglomeration
of
dry
trunks
around
this
obstacle
was
cleared
ground
occupied
by
men
who
lived
slept
and
worked
about
this
huge
manufactory
on
wheels
the
senator
who
had
written
verse
in
his
youth
and
composed
oratorical
poetry
when
dedicating
various
monuments
in
his
district
saw
in
these
solitary
men
on
the
mountain
side
blackened
by
the
sun
and
smoke
with
naked
breasts
and
bare
arms
a
species
of
priests
dedicated
to
the
service
of
a
fatal
divinity
that
was
receiving
from
their
hands
offerings
of
enormous
explosive
capsules
hurling
them
forth
in
thunderclaps
hidden
under
the
branches
in
order
to
escape
the
observation
of
the
enemy
s
birdmen
the
french
cannon
were
scattered
among
the
hills
and
hollows
of
the
highland
range
in
this
herd
of
steel
there
were
enormous
pieces
with
wheels
reinforced
by
metal
plates
somewhat
like
the
farming
engines
which
desnoyers
had
used
on
his
ranch
for
plowing
like
smaller
beasts
more
agile
and
playful
in
their
incessant
yelping
the
groups
of
were
mingled
with
the
terrific
monsters
the
two
captains
had
received
from
the
general
of
their
division
orders
to
show
senator
lacour
minutely
the
workings
of
the
artillery
and
lacour
was
accepting
their
observations
with
corresponding
gravity
while
his
eyes
roved
from
side
to
side
in
the
hope
of
recognizing
his
son
the
interesting
thing
for
him
was
to
see
rene
but
recollecting
the
official
pretext
of
his
journey
he
followed
submissively
from
cannon
to
cannon
listening
patiently
to
all
explanations
the
operators
next
showed
him
the
servants
of
these
pieces
great
oval
cylinders
extracted
from
subterranean
storehouses
called
shelters
these
storage
places
were
deep
burrows
oblique
wells
reinforced
with
sacks
of
stones
and
wood
they
served
as
a
refuge
to
those
off
duty
and
kept
the
munitions
away
from
the
enemy
s
shell
an
artilleryman
exhibited
two
pouches
of
white
cloth
joined
together
and
very
full
they
looked
like
a
double
sausage
and
were
the
charge
for
one
of
the
large
cannons
the
open
packet
showed
some
leaves
and
the
senator
greatly
admired
this
dainty
paste
which
looked
like
an
article
for
the
dressing
table
instead
of
one
of
the
most
terrible
explosives
of
modern
warfare
i
am
sure
said
lacour
that
if
i
had
found
one
of
these
delicate
packets
on
the
street
i
should
have
thought
that
it
had
been
dropped
from
some
lady
s
vanity
bag
or
by
some
careless
clerk
from
a
perfumery
shop
anything
but
an
explosive
and
with
this
trifle
that
looks
as
if
it
were
made
for
the
lips
it
is
possible
to
blow
up
an
edifice
as
they
continued
their
visit
of
investigation
they
came
upon
a
partially
destroyed
round
tower
in
the
highest
part
of
the
mountain
this
was
the
most
dangerous
post
from
it
an
officer
was
examining
the
enemy
s
line
in
order
to
gauge
the
correctness
of
the
aim
of
the
gunners
while
his
comrades
were
under
the
ground
or
hidden
by
the
branches
he
was
fulfilling
his
mission
from
this
visible
point
a
short
distance
from
the
tower
a
subterranean
passageway
opened
before
their
eyes
they
descended
through
its
murky
recesses
until
they
found
the
various
rooms
excavated
in
the
ground
one
side
of
the
mountain
cut
in
points
formed
its
exterior
facade
narrow
little
windows
cut
in
the
stone
gave
light
and
air
to
these
quarters
an
old
commandant
in
charge
of
the
section
came
out
to
meet
them
desnoyers
thought
that
he
must
be
the
floorwalker
of
some
big
department
store
in
paris
his
manners
were
so
exquisite
and
his
voice
so
suave
that
he
seemed
to
be
imploring
pardon
at
every
word
or
addressing
a
group
of
ladies
offering
them
goods
of
the
latest
novelty
but
this
impression
only
lasted
a
moment
this
soldier
with
gray
hair
and
glasses
who
in
the
midst
of
war
was
retaining
his
customary
manner
of
a
building
director
receiving
his
clients
showed
on
moving
his
arms
some
bandages
and
surgical
dressings
within
his
sleeves
he
was
wounded
in
both
wrists
by
the
explosion
of
a
shell
but
he
was
nevertheless
sticking
to
his
post
a
devil
of
a
syrupy
gentleman
mused
don
marcelo
yet
he
is
undoubtedly
an
exceptional
person
by
this
time
they
had
entered
into
the
main
office
a
vast
room
which
received
its
light
through
a
horizontal
window
about
ten
feet
wide
and
only
a
palm
and
a
half
high
reminding
one
of
the
open
space
between
the
slats
of
a
venetian
blind
below
it
was
a
pine
table
filled
with
papers
and
surrounded
by
stools
when
occupying
one
of
these
seats
one
s
eyes
could
sweep
the
entire
plain
on
the
walls
were
electric
apparatus
acoustic
tubes
and
telephones
many
telephones
the
commandant
sorted
and
piled
up
the
papers
offering
the
stools
with
punctilio
here
senator
desnoyers
humble
attendant
took
a
seat
at
his
side
the
commandant
now
appeared
to
be
the
manager
of
a
theatre
preparing
to
exhibit
an
extraordinary
show
he
spread
upon
the
table
an
enormous
paper
which
reproduced
all
the
features
of
the
plain
extended
before
them
roads
towns
fields
heights
and
valleys
upon
this
map
was
a
triangular
group
of
red
lines
in
the
form
of
an
open
fan
the
vertex
represented
the
place
where
they
were
and
the
broad
part
of
the
triangle
was
the
limit
of
the
horizon
which
they
were
sweeping
with
their
eyes
we
are
going
to
fire
at
that
grove
said
the
artilleryman
pointing
to
one
end
of
the
map
there
it
is
he
continued
designating
a
little
dark
line
take
your
but
before
they
could
adjust
the
binoculars
the
commandant
placed
a
new
paper
on
top
of
the
map
it
was
an
enormous
and
somewhat
hazy
photograph
upon
whose
plan
appeared
a
fan
of
red
lines
like
the
other
one
our
aviators
explained
the
gunner
courteously
have
taken
this
morning
some
views
of
the
enemy
s
positions
this
is
an
enlargement
from
our
photographic
laboratory
according
to
this
information
there
are
two
german
regiments
encamped
in
that
don
marcelo
saw
on
the
print
the
spot
of
woods
and
within
it
white
lines
which
represented
roads
and
groups
of
little
squares
which
were
blocks
of
houses
in
a
village
he
believed
he
must
be
in
an
aeroplane
contemplating
the
earth
from
a
height
of
three
thousand
feet
then
he
raised
the
glasses
to
his
eyes
following
the
direction
of
one
of
the
red
lines
and
saw
enlarged
in
the
circle
of
the
glass
a
black
bar
somewhat
like
a
heavy
line
of
ink
the
grove
the
refuge
of
the
foe
whenever
you
say
senator
lacour
we
will
begin
said
the
commandant
reaching
the
topmost
notch
of
his
courtesy
are
you
ready
desnoyers
smiled
slightly
for
what
was
his
illustrious
friend
to
make
himself
ready
what
difference
could
it
possibly
make
to
a
mere
spectator
much
interested
in
the
novelty
of
the
show
there
sounded
behind
them
numberless
bells
gongs
that
called
and
gongs
that
answered
the
acoustic
tubes
seemed
to
swell
out
with
the
gallop
of
words
the
electric
wire
filled
the
silence
of
the
room
with
the
palpitations
of
its
mysterious
life
the
bland
chief
was
no
longer
occupied
with
his
guests
they
conjectured
that
he
was
behind
them
his
mouth
at
the
telephone
conversing
with
various
officials
some
distance
off
yet
the
urbane
and
hero
was
not
abandoning
for
one
moment
his
candied
courtesy
will
you
be
kind
enough
to
tell
me
when
you
are
ready
to
begin
they
heard
him
saying
to
a
distant
officer
i
shall
be
much
pleased
to
transmit
the
don
marcelo
felt
a
slight
nervous
tremor
near
one
of
his
legs
it
was
lecour
on
the
qui
vive
over
the
approaching
novelty
they
were
going
to
begin
firing
something
was
going
to
happen
that
he
had
never
seen
before
the
cannons
were
above
their
heads
the
roughly
vaulted
roof
was
going
to
tremble
like
the
deck
of
a
ship
when
they
shot
over
it
the
room
with
its
acoustic
tubes
and
its
vibrations
from
the
telephones
was
like
the
bridge
of
a
vessel
at
the
moment
of
clearing
for
action
the
noise
that
it
was
going
to
make
a
few
seconds
flitted
by
that
to
them
seemed
unusually
long
and
then
suddenly
a
sound
like
a
distant
peal
of
thunder
which
appeared
to
come
from
the
clouds
desnoyers
no
longer
felt
the
nervous
twitter
against
his
knee
the
senator
seemed
surprised
his
expression
seemed
to
say
and
is
that
all
the
heaps
of
earth
above
them
had
deadened
the
report
so
that
the
discharge
of
the
great
machine
seemed
no
more
than
the
blow
of
a
club
upon
a
mattress
far
more
impressive
was
the
scream
of
the
projectile
sounding
at
a
great
height
but
displacing
the
air
with
such
violence
that
its
waves
reached
even
to
the
window
it
went
flying
flying
its
roar
lessening
some
time
passed
before
they
noticed
its
effects
and
the
two
friends
began
to
believe
that
it
must
have
been
lost
in
space
it
will
not
strike
it
will
not
strike
they
were
thinking
suddenly
there
surged
up
on
the
horizon
exactly
in
the
spot
indicated
over
the
blur
of
the
woods
a
tremendous
column
of
smoke
a
whirling
tower
of
black
vapor
followed
by
a
volcanic
explosion
how
dreadful
it
must
be
to
be
there
said
the
senator
he
and
desnoyers
were
experiencing
a
sensation
of
animal
joy
a
selfish
hilarity
in
seeing
themselves
in
such
a
safe
place
several
yards
underground
the
germans
are
going
to
reply
at
any
moment
said
don
marcelo
to
his
friend
the
senator
was
of
the
same
opinion
undoubtedly
they
would
retaliate
carrying
on
an
artillery
duel
all
of
the
french
batteries
had
opened
fire
the
mountain
was
thundering
the
shell
whining
the
horizon
still
tranquil
was
bristling
with
black
spiral
columns
the
two
realized
more
and
more
how
snug
they
were
in
this
retreat
like
a
box
at
the
theatre
someone
touched
lacour
on
the
shoulder
it
was
one
of
the
captains
who
was
conducting
them
through
the
front
we
are
going
above
he
said
simply
you
must
see
close
by
how
our
cannons
are
working
the
sight
will
be
well
worth
the
above
the
illustrious
man
was
as
perplexed
as
astonished
as
though
he
had
suggested
an
interplanetary
trip
above
when
the
enemy
was
going
to
reply
from
one
minute
to
another
the
captain
explained
that
lacour
was
perhaps
awaiting
his
father
by
telephone
they
had
advised
his
battery
stationed
a
little
further
on
it
would
be
necessary
to
go
now
in
order
to
see
him
so
they
again
climbed
up
to
the
light
through
the
mouth
of
the
tunnel
the
senator
then
drew
himself
up
majestically
erect
they
are
going
to
fire
at
us
said
a
voice
in
his
interior
the
foe
is
going
to
but
he
adjusted
his
coat
like
a
tragic
mantle
and
advanced
at
a
circumspect
and
solemn
pace
if
those
military
men
adversaries
of
parliamentarism
fancied
that
they
were
going
to
laugh
up
their
sleeve
at
the
timidity
of
a
civilian
he
would
show
them
their
mistake
desnoyers
could
not
but
admire
the
resolution
with
which
the
great
man
made
his
exit
from
the
shelter
exactly
as
if
he
were
going
to
march
against
the
foe
at
a
little
distance
the
atmosphere
was
rent
into
tumultuous
waves
making
their
legs
tremble
their
ears
hum
and
their
necks
feel
as
though
they
had
just
been
struck
they
both
thought
that
the
germans
had
begun
to
return
the
fire
but
it
was
the
french
who
were
shooting
a
feathery
stream
of
vapor
came
up
out
of
the
woods
a
dozen
yards
away
dissolving
instantly
one
of
the
largest
pieces
hidden
in
the
nearby
thicket
had
just
been
discharged
the
captains
continued
their
explanations
without
stopping
their
journey
it
was
necessary
to
pass
directly
in
front
of
the
spitting
monster
in
spite
of
the
violence
of
its
reports
so
as
not
to
venture
out
into
the
open
woods
near
the
watch
tower
they
were
expecting
from
one
second
to
another
now
the
response
from
their
neighbors
across
the
way
the
guide
accompanying
don
marcelo
congratulated
him
on
the
fearlessness
with
which
he
was
enduring
the
cannonading
my
friend
is
well
acquainted
with
it
remarked
the
senator
proudly
he
was
in
the
battle
of
the
the
two
soldiers
evidently
thought
this
very
strange
considering
desnoyers
advanced
age
to
what
section
had
he
belonged
in
what
capacity
had
he
served
merely
as
a
victim
was
the
modest
reply
an
officer
came
running
toward
them
from
the
tower
side
across
the
cleared
space
he
waved
his
kepi
several
times
that
they
might
see
him
better
lacour
trembled
for
him
the
enemy
might
descry
him
he
was
simply
making
a
target
of
himself
by
cutting
across
that
open
space
in
order
to
reach
them
the
sooner
and
he
trembled
still
more
as
he
came
nearer
it
was
rene
his
hands
returned
with
some
astonishment
the
strong
muscular
grasp
he
noticed
that
the
outlines
of
his
son
s
face
were
more
pronounced
and
darkened
with
the
tan
of
camp
life
an
air
of
resolution
of
confidence
in
his
own
powers
appeared
to
emanate
from
his
person
six
months
of
intense
life
had
transformed
him
he
was
the
same
but
and
more
stalwart
the
gentle
and
sweet
features
of
his
mother
were
lost
under
the
virile
mask
lacour
recognized
with
pride
that
he
now
resembled
himself
after
greetings
had
been
exchanged
rene
paid
more
attention
to
don
marcelo
than
to
his
father
because
he
reminded
him
of
chichi
he
inquired
after
her
wishing
to
know
all
the
details
of
her
life
in
spite
of
their
ardent
and
constant
correspondence
the
senator
meanwhile
still
under
the
influence
of
his
recent
emotion
had
adopted
a
somewhat
oratorical
air
toward
his
son
he
forthwith
improvised
a
fragment
of
discourse
in
honor
of
that
soldier
of
the
republic
bearing
the
glorious
name
of
lacour
deeming
this
an
opportune
time
to
make
known
to
these
professional
soldiers
the
lofty
lineage
of
his
family
do
your
duty
my
son
the
lacours
inherit
warrior
traditions
remember
our
ancestor
the
deputy
of
the
convention
who
covered
himself
with
glory
in
the
defense
of
mayence
while
he
was
discoursing
they
had
started
forward
doubling
a
point
of
the
greenwood
in
order
to
get
behind
the
cannons
here
the
racket
was
less
violent
the
great
engines
after
each
discharge
were
letting
escape
through
the
rear
chambers
little
clouds
of
smoke
like
those
from
a
pipe
the
sergeants
were
dictating
numbers
communicated
in
a
low
voice
by
another
gunner
who
had
a
telephone
receiver
at
his
ear
the
workmen
around
the
cannon
were
obeying
silently
they
would
touch
a
little
wheel
and
the
monster
would
raise
its
grey
snout
moving
it
from
side
to
side
with
the
intelligent
expression
and
agility
of
an
elephant
s
trunk
at
the
foot
of
the
nearest
piece
stood
the
operator
rod
in
hand
and
with
impassive
face
he
must
be
deaf
yet
his
facial
inertia
was
stamped
with
a
certain
authority
for
him
life
was
no
more
than
a
series
of
shots
and
detonations
he
knew
his
importance
he
was
the
servant
of
the
tempest
the
guardian
of
the
thunderbolt
fire
shouted
the
sergeant
and
the
thunder
broke
forth
in
fury
everything
appeared
to
be
trembling
but
the
two
visitors
were
by
this
time
so
accustomed
to
the
din
that
the
present
uproar
seemed
but
a
secondary
affair
lacour
was
about
to
take
up
the
thread
of
his
discourse
about
his
glorious
forefather
in
the
convention
when
something
interfered
they
are
firing
said
the
man
at
the
telephone
simply
the
two
officers
repeated
to
the
senator
this
news
from
the
watch
tower
had
he
not
said
that
the
enemy
was
going
to
fire
obeying
a
sane
instinct
of
preservation
and
pushed
at
the
same
time
by
his
son
he
found
himself
in
the
refuge
of
the
battery
he
certainly
did
not
wish
to
hide
himself
in
this
cave
so
he
remained
near
the
entrance
with
a
curiosity
which
got
the
best
of
his
disquietude
he
felt
the
approach
of
the
invisible
projectile
in
spite
of
the
roar
of
the
neighboring
cannon
he
perceived
with
rare
sensibility
its
passage
through
the
air
above
the
other
closer
and
more
powerful
sounds
it
was
a
squealing
howl
that
was
swelling
in
intensity
that
was
opening
out
as
it
advanced
filling
all
space
soon
it
ceased
to
be
a
shriek
becoming
a
rude
roar
formed
by
divers
collisions
and
frictions
like
the
descent
of
an
electric
tram
through
a
hillside
road
or
the
course
of
a
train
which
passes
through
a
station
without
stopping
he
saw
it
approach
in
the
form
of
a
cloud
bulging
as
though
it
were
going
to
explode
over
the
battery
without
knowing
just
how
it
happened
the
senator
suddenly
found
himself
in
the
bottom
of
the
shelter
his
hands
in
cold
contact
with
a
heap
of
steel
cylinders
lined
up
like
bottles
they
were
projectiles
if
a
german
shell
he
thought
should
explode
above
this
burrow
what
a
frightful
blowing
up
but
he
calmed
himself
by
reflecting
on
the
solidity
of
the
arched
vault
with
its
beams
and
sacks
of
earth
several
yards
thick
suddenly
he
was
in
absolute
darkness
another
had
sought
refuge
in
the
shelter
obstructing
the
light
with
his
body
perhaps
his
friend
desnoyers
a
year
passed
by
while
his
watch
was
registering
a
single
second
then
a
century
at
the
same
rate
and
finally
the
awaited
thunder
burst
forth
making
the
refuge
vibrate
but
with
a
kind
of
dull
elasticity
as
though
it
were
made
of
rubber
in
spite
of
its
thud
the
explosion
wrought
horrible
damage
other
minor
explosions
playful
and
whistling
followed
behind
the
first
in
his
imagination
lacour
saw
the
cataclysm
a
writhing
serpent
vomiting
sparks
and
smoke
a
species
of
wagnerian
monster
that
upon
striking
the
ground
was
disgorging
thousands
of
fiery
little
snakes
that
were
covering
the
earth
with
their
deadly
contortions
the
shell
must
have
burst
nearby
perhaps
in
the
very
square
occupied
by
this
battery
he
came
out
of
the
shelter
expecting
to
encounter
a
sickening
display
of
dismembered
bodies
and
he
saw
his
son
smiling
smoking
a
cigar
and
talking
with
desnoyers
that
was
a
mere
nothing
the
gunners
were
tranquilly
finishing
the
charging
of
a
huge
piece
they
had
raised
their
eyes
for
a
moment
as
the
enemy
s
shell
went
screaming
by
and
then
had
continued
their
work
it
must
have
fallen
about
three
hundred
yards
away
said
rene
cheerfully
the
senator
impressionable
soul
felt
suddenly
filled
with
heroic
confidence
it
was
not
worth
while
to
bother
about
his
personal
safety
when
other
men
just
like
him
only
differently
dressed
were
not
paying
the
slightest
attention
to
the
danger
and
as
the
other
projectiles
soared
over
his
head
to
lose
themselves
in
the
woods
with
the
explosions
of
a
volcano
he
remained
by
his
son
s
side
with
no
other
sign
of
tension
than
a
slight
trembling
of
the
knees
it
seemed
to
him
now
that
it
was
only
the
french
missiles
because
they
were
on
his
side
that
were
hitting
the
bull
s
eye
the
others
must
be
going
up
in
the
air
and
losing
themselves
in
useless
noise
of
just
such
illusions
is
valor
often
compounded
and
is
that
all
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
asking
he
now
recalled
rather
shamefacedly
his
retreat
to
the
shelter
he
was
beginning
to
feel
that
he
could
live
in
the
open
the
same
as
rene
the
german
missiles
were
getting
considerably
more
frequent
they
were
no
longer
lost
in
the
wood
and
their
detonations
were
sounding
nearer
and
nearer
the
two
officials
exchanged
glances
they
were
responsible
for
the
safety
of
their
distinguished
charge
now
they
are
warming
up
said
one
of
them
rene
as
though
reading
their
thoughts
prepared
to
go
father
they
were
needing
him
in
his
battery
the
senator
tried
to
resist
he
wished
to
prolong
the
interview
but
found
that
he
was
hitting
against
something
hard
and
inflexible
that
repelled
all
his
influence
a
senator
amounted
to
very
little
with
people
accustomed
to
discipline
farewell
my
boy
all
success
to
you
remember
who
you
are
the
father
wept
as
he
embraced
his
son
lamenting
the
brevity
of
the
interview
and
thinking
of
the
dangers
awaiting
him
when
rene
had
disappeared
the
captains
again
recommended
their
departure
it
was
getting
late
they
ought
to
reach
a
certain
cantonment
before
nightfall
so
they
went
down
the
hill
in
the
shelter
of
a
cut
in
the
mountain
seeing
the
enemy
s
shells
flying
high
above
them
in
a
hollow
they
came
upon
several
groups
of
the
famed
spread
about
through
the
woods
hidden
by
piles
of
underbrush
like
snapping
dogs
howling
and
sticking
up
their
gray
muzzles
the
great
cannon
were
roaring
only
at
intervals
while
the
steel
pack
of
hounds
were
yelping
incessantly
without
the
slightest
break
in
their
noisy
wrath
like
the
endless
tearing
of
a
piece
of
cloth
the
pieces
were
many
the
volleys
dizzying
and
the
shots
uniting
in
one
prolonged
shriek
as
a
series
of
dots
unite
to
form
a
single
line
the
chiefs
stimulated
by
the
din
were
giving
their
orders
in
yells
and
waving
their
arms
from
behind
the
pieces
the
cannon
were
sliding
over
the
motionless
gun
carriages
advancing
and
receding
like
automatic
pistols
each
charge
dropped
an
empty
shell
and
introduced
a
fresh
one
into
the
smoking
chamber
behind
the
battery
the
air
was
racking
in
furious
waves
with
every
shot
lacour
and
his
companion
received
a
blow
on
the
breast
the
violent
contact
with
an
invisible
hand
pushing
them
backward
and
forward
they
had
to
adjust
their
breathing
to
the
rhythm
of
the
concussions
during
the
hundredth
part
of
a
second
between
the
passing
of
one
aerial
wave
and
the
advance
of
the
next
their
chests
felt
the
agony
of
vacuum
desnoyers
admired
the
baying
of
those
gray
dogs
he
knew
well
their
bite
extending
across
many
kilometres
now
they
were
fresh
and
at
home
in
their
own
kennels
to
lacour
it
seemed
as
though
the
rows
of
cannon
were
chanting
a
measure
monotonous
and
fiercely
impassioned
that
must
be
the
martial
hymn
of
the
humanity
of
prehistoric
times
this
music
of
dry
deafening
delirious
notes
was
awakening
in
the
two
what
is
sleeping
in
the
depths
of
every
soul
the
savagery
of
a
remote
ancestry
the
air
was
hot
with
acrid
odors
pungent
and
brutishly
intoxicating
the
perfumes
from
the
explosions
were
penetrating
to
the
brain
through
the
mouth
the
eyes
and
the
ears
they
began
to
be
infected
with
the
same
ardor
as
the
directors
shouting
and
swinging
their
arms
in
the
midst
of
the
thundering
the
empty
capsules
were
mounting
up
in
thick
layers
behind
the
cannon
fire
always
fire
we
must
sprinkle
them
well
yelled
the
chiefs
we
must
give
a
good
soaking
to
the
groves
where
the
boches
are
so
the
mouths
of
rained
without
interruption
inundating
the
remote
thickets
with
their
shells
inflamed
by
this
deadly
activity
frenzied
by
the
destructive
celerity
dominated
by
the
dizzying
sway
of
the
ruby
leaves
lacour
and
desnoyers
found
themselves
waving
their
hats
leaping
from
one
side
to
another
as
though
they
were
dancing
the
sacred
dance
of
death
and
shouting
with
mouths
dry
from
the
acrid
vapor
of
the
powder
hurrah
hurrah
the
automobile
rode
all
the
afternoon
long
stopping
only
when
it
met
long
files
of
convoys
it
traversed
uncultivated
fields
with
skeletons
of
dwellings
and
ran
through
burned
towns
which
were
no
more
than
a
succession
of
blackened
facades
now
it
is
your
turn
said
the
senator
to
desnoyers
we
are
going
to
see
your
at
nightfall
they
ran
across
groups
of
infantry
soldiers
with
long
beards
and
blue
uniforms
discolored
by
the
inclemency
of
the
weather
they
were
returning
from
the
intrenchments
carrying
over
the
hump
of
their
knapsacks
spades
picks
and
other
implements
for
removing
the
ground
that
had
acquired
the
importance
of

of

they
were
covered
with
mud
from

to
foot
all
looked
old
in
full
youth
their
joy
at
returning
to
the
cantonment
after
a
week
in
the
trenches
made
them
fill
the
silence
of
the
plain
with
songs
in
time
to
the
tramp
of
their
nailed
boots
through
the
violet
twilight
drifted
the
winged
strophes
of
the
marseillaise

the
heroic
affirmations
of
the

of

france

their
charges
for
the
night
in
a
town
where
one
of
their
divisions
had
its
headquarters
and
then
took
their
leave
others
would
act
as
their
escort
the
following
morning
the
two
friends
were
lodging
in
the
hotel
de

an
old
inn
with
its
front
gnawed
by
the
proprietor
showed
them
with
pride
a
window
broken
in
the
form
of
a
crater
this
window
had
made
the

of

with
the

of

into

occupying

to

had
received
the
mark
of

anxious
to

it
out

before
they
went
to

everything
was
broken

of
splinters
in
the

a
fringe
of
tatters
hanging
from
the
walls
through
an
enormous
hole
they
could
see
the
stars
and
feel
the
chill
of
the
night
the
owner
stated
that
this
destruction
was
not
the
work
of
the
germans
but
was
caused
by
a
projectile
from
one
of
the
when
repelling
the
invaders
from
the

and
he
beamed
on
the
ruin
with
patriotic
pride
repeating
there

of

marksmanship
for
you
how
do
you

think
of

of
the

of
the
journey
don
marcelo
slept
badly
excited
by
the
thought
that
his
son
was
not
far
away
an
hour
before
daybreak
they
left
the
village
in
an
automobile
guided
by
another
official
on
both
sides
of
the
road
they
saw
camps
and
camps
they
left
behind
the
parks
of
munitions
passed
the
third
line
of
troops
and
then
the
second
thousands
and
thousands
of
men
were
bivouacking
there
in
the
open
improvising
as
best
they
could
their
habitations
these
human
seemed
vaguely
to
recall
with
the
variety
of
uniforms
and
races
some
of
the
mighty
invasions
of
history
but
it
was
not
a
nation
en
marche
the
exodus
of
people
takes
with
it
the
women
and
children
here
there
were
nothing
but
men
men
everywhere
all
kinds
of
housing
ever
used
by
humanity
were
here
utilized
these
military
assemblages
beginning
with
the
cave
caverns
and
quarries
were
serving
as
barracks
some
low
huts
recalled
the
american
ranch
others
high
and
conical
were
facsimiles
of
the
gurbi
of
africa
many
of
the
soldiers
had
come
from
the
colonies
some
had
been
living
as
business
men
in
the
new
world
and
upon
having
to
provide
a
house
more
stable
than
the
canvas
tent
had
recalled
the
architecture
of
the
tribes
with
which
they
had
had
dealings
in
this
conglomerate
of
combatants
there
were
also
moors
blacks
and
asiatics
who
were
accustomed
to
live
outside
the
cities
and
had
acquired
in
the
open
a
physical
superiority
which
made
them
more
masterful

civilized
peoples

was
flapping
white
clothing
hung
out
to
dry
rows
of
men
with
bared
breasts
were
out
in
the
morning
freshness
leaning
over
the
streams
washing
themselves
with
noisy
ablutions
followed
by
vigorous
rubbings
on
a
bridge
was
a
soldier
writing
utilizing
a
parapet
as
a
table
the
cooks
were
moving
around
their
savory
kettles
and
a
warm
exhalation
of
morning
soup
was
mixed
with
the
resinous
perfume
of
the
trees
and
the
smell
of
the
damp
earth
long
low
barracks
of
wood
and
zinc
served
the
cavalry
and
artillery
for
their
animals
and
stores
in
the
open
air
the
soldiers
were
currying
and
shoeing
the
glossy
plump
horses
which
the
was
maintaining
in
placid
obesity
if
they
had
only
been
like
that
at
the
battle
of
the
marne
sighed
desnoyers
to
his
friend
now
the
cavalry
was
leading
an
existence
of
interminable
rest
the
troopers
were
fighting
on
foot
and
finding
it
necessary
to
exercise
their
steeds
to
keep
them
from
getting
sick
with
their
full
mangers
there
were
spread
over
the
fields
several
aeroplanes
like
great
gray
dragon
flies
poised
for
the
flight
many
of
the
men
were
grouped
around
them
the
farmers
transformed
into
soldiers
were
watching
with
great
admiration
their
comrade
charged
with
the
management
of
these
machines
they
looked
upon
him
as
one
of
the
wizards
so
venerated
and
feared
in
all
the
countryside
don
marcelo
was
struck
by
the
general
transformation
in
the
french
uniforms
all
were
now
clad
in
from
head
to
foot
the
trousers
of
bright
scarlet
cloth
the
red
kepis
which
he
had
hailed
with
such
joy
in
the
expedition
of
the
marne
no
longer
existed
all
the
men
passing
along
the
roads
were
soldiers
all
the
vehicles
even
the
were
guided
by
military
men
suddenly
the
automobile
stopped
before
some
ruined
houses
blackened
by
fire
here
we
are
announced
the
official
now
we
shall
have
to
walk
a
the
senator
and
his
friend
started
along
the
highway
not
that
way
no
the
guide
turned
to
say
grimly
that
road
is
bad
for
the
health
we
must
keep
out
of
the
currents
of
he
further
explained
that
the
germans
had
their
cannon
and
intrenchments
at
the
end
of
this
highroad
which
sloped
suddenly
and
again
appeared
as
a
white
ribbon
on
the
horizon
line
between
two
rows
of
trees
and
burned
houses
the
pale
morning
light
with
its
hazy
mist
was
sheltering
them
from
the
enemy
s
fire
on
a
sunny
day
the
arrival
of
their
automobile
would
have
been
saluted
with
a
shell
that
is
war
he
concluded
one
is
always
near
to
death
without
seeing
the
two
recalled
the
warning
of
the
general
with
whom
they
had
dined
the
day
before
be
very
careful
the
war
of
the
trenches
is
in
the
sweep
of
plains
unrolled
before
them
not
a
man
was
visible
it
seemed
like
a
country
sunday
when
the
farmers
are
in
their
homes
and
the
land
scene
lying
in
silent
meditation
some
shapeless
objects
could
be
seen
in
the
fields
like
agricultural
implements
deserted
for
a
day
of
rest
perhaps
they
were
broken
automobiles
or
artillery
carriages
destroyed
by
the
force
of
their
volleys
this
way
said
the
officer
who
had
added
four
soldiers
to
the
party
to
carry
the
various
bags
and
packages
which
desnoyers
had
brought
out
on
the
roof
of
the
automobile
they
proceeded
in
a
single
file
the
length
of
a
wall
of
blackened
bricks
down
a
steep
hill
after
a
few
steps
the
surface
of
the
ground
was
about
to
their
knees
further
on
up
to
their
waists
and
thus
they
disappeared
within
the
earth
seeing
above
their
heads
only
a
narrow
strip
of
sky
they
were
now
under
the
open
field
having
left
behind
them
the
mass
of
ruins
that
hid
the
entrance
of
the
road
they
were
advancing
in
an
absurd
way
as
though
they
scorned
direct
lines
in
in
curves
in
angles
other
pathways
no
less
complicated
branched
off
from
this
ditch
which
was
the
central
avenue
of
an
immense
subterranean
cavity
they
walked
and
walked
and
walked
a
quarter
of
an
hour
went
by
a
half
an
entire
hour
lacour
and
his
friend
thought
longingly
of
the
roadways
flanked
with
trees
of
their
tramp
in
the
open
air
where
they
could
see
the
sky
and
meadows
they
were
not
going
twenty
steps
in
the
same
direction
the
official
marching
ahead
was
every
moment
vanishing
around
a
new
bend
those
who
were
coming
behind
were
panting
and
talking
unseen
having
to
quicken
their
steps
in
order
not
to
lose
sight
of
the
party
every
now
and
then
they
had
to
halt
in
order
to
unite
and
count
the
little
band
to
make
sure
that
no
one
had
been
lost
in
a
transverse
gallery
the
ground
was
exceedingly
slippery
in
some
places
almost
liquid
mud
white
and
caustic
like
the
drip
from
the
scaffolding
of
a
house
in
the
course
of
construction
the
thump
of
their
footsteps
and
the
friction
of
their
shoulders
brought
down
chunks
of
earth
and
smooth
stones
from
the
sides
little
by
little
they
climbed
through
the
main
artery
of
this
underground
body
and
the
veins
connected
with
it
again
they
were
near
the
surface
where
it
required
but
little
effort
to
see
the
blue
above
the
but
here
the
fields
were
uncultivated
surrounded
with
wire
fences
yet
with
the
same
appearance
of
sabbath
calm
knowing
by
sad
experience
what
curiosity
oftentimes
cost
the
official
would
not
permit
them
to
linger
here
keep
right
ahead
forward
march
for
an
hour
and
a
half
the
party
kept
doggedly
on
until
the
senior
members
became
greatly
bewildered
and
fatigued
by
their
serpentine
meanderings
they
could
no
longer
tell
whether
they
were
advancing
or
receding
the
sudden
steeps
and
the
continual
turning
bringing
on
an
attack
of
vertigo
have
we
much
further
to
go
asked
the
senator
there
responded
the
guide
pointing
to
some
heaps
of
earth
above
them
there
was
a
bell
tower
surrounded
by
a
few
charred
houses
that
could
be
seen
a
long
ways
off
the
remains
of
a
hamlet
which
had
been
taken
and
retaken
by
both
sides
by
going
in
a
direct
line
on
the
surface
they
would
have
compassed
this
distance
in
half
an
hour
to
the
angles
of
the
underground
road
arranged
to
impede
the
advance
of
an
enemy
there
had
been
added
the
obstacles
of
campaign
fortification
tunnels
cut
with
wire
lattice
work
large
hanging
cages
of
wire
which
on
falling
could
block
the
passage
and
enable
the
defenders
to
open
fire
across
their
gratings
they
began
to
meet
soldiers
with
packs
and
pails
of
water
who
were
soon
lost
in
the
tortuous
cross
roads
some
seated
on
piles
of
wood
were
smiling
as
they
read
a
little
periodical
published
in
the
trenches
the
soldiers
stepped
aside
to
make
way
for
the
visiting
procession
bearded
and
curious
faces
peeping
out
of
the
alleyways
afar
off
sounded
a
crackling
of
short
snaps
as
though
at
the
end
of
the
winding
lanes
were
a
shooting
lodge
where
a
group
of
sportsmen
were
killing
pigeons
the
morning
was
still
cloudy
and
cold
in
spite
of
the
humid
atmosphere
a
buzzing
like
that
of
a
horsefly
hummed
several
times
above
the
two
visitors
bullets
said
their
conductor
laconically
desnoyers
meanwhile
had
lowered
his
head
a
little
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
insectivorous
sound
the
senator
walked
on
more
briskly
temporarily
forgetting
his
weariness
they
came
to
a
halt
before
a
who
received
them
like
an
engineer
exhibiting
his
workshops
like
a
naval
officer
showing
off
the
batteries
and
turrets
of
his
battleships
he
was
the
chief
of
the
battalion
occupying
this
section
of
the
trenches
don
marcelo
studied
him
with
special
interest
knowing
that
his
son
was
under
his
orders
to
the
two
friends
these
subterranean
fortifications
bore
a
certain
resemblance
to
the
lower
parts
of
a
vessel
they
passed
from
trench
to
trench
of
the
last
line
the
oldest
dark
galleries
into
which
penetrated
streaks
of
light
across
the
loopholes
and
broad
low
windows
of
the
mitrailleuse
the
long
line
of
defense
formed
a
tunnel
cut
by
short
open
spaces
they
had
to
go
stumbling
from
light
to
darkness
and
from
darkness
to
light
with
a
visual
suddenness
very
fatiguing
to
the
eyes
the
ground
was
higher
in
the
open
spaces
there
were
wooden
benches
placed
against
the
sides
so
that
the
observers
could
put
out
the
head
or
examine
the
landscape
by
means
of
the
periscope
the
enclosed
space
answered
both
for
batteries
and
sleeping
quarters
as
the
enemy
had
been
repelled
and
more
ground
had
been
gained
the
combatants
who
had
been
living
all
winter
in
these
first
quarters
had
tried
to
make
themselves
more
comfortable
over
the
trenches
in
the
open
air
they
had
laid
beams
from
the
ruined
houses
over
the
beams
planks
doors
and
windows
and
on
top
of
the
wood
layers
of
sacks
of
earth
these
sacks
were
covered
by
a
top
of
fertile
soil
from
which
sprouted
grass
and
herbs
giving
the
roofs
of
the
trenches
an
appearance
of
pastoral
placidity
the
temporary
arches
could
thus
resist
the
shock
of
the
abuses
which
went
ploughing
into
the
earth
without
causing
any
special
damage
when
an
explosion
was
pounding
too
noisily
and
weakening
the
structure
the
troglodytes
would
swarm
out
in
the
night
like
watchful
ants
and
skilfully
readjust
the
roof
of
their
primitive
dwellings
everything
appeared
clean
with
that
simple
and
rather
clumsy
cleanliness
exercised
by
men
living
far
from
women
and
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
the
galleries
were
something
like
the
cloisters
of
a
monastery
the
corridors
of
a
prison
and
the
middle
sections
of
a
ship
their
floors
were
a
half
yard
lower
than
that
of
the
open
spaces
which
joined
the
trenches
together
in
order
that
the
officers
might
avoid
so
many
ups
and
downs
some
planks
had
been
laid
forming
a
sort
of
scaffolding
from
doorway
to
doorway
upon
the
approach
of
their
chief
the
soldiers
formed
themselves
in
line
their
heads
being
on
a
level
with
the
waist
of
those
passing
over
the
planks
desnoyers
ran
his
eye
hungrily
over
the
file
of
men
where
could
julio
be
he
noticed
the
individual
contour
of
the
different
redoubts
they
all
seemed
to
have
been
constructed
in
about
the
same
way
but
their
occupants
had
modified
them
with
their
special
personal
decorations
the
exteriors
were
always
cut
with
loopholes
in
which
there
were
guns
pointed
toward
the
enemy
and
windows
for
the
mitrailleuses
the
watchers
near
these
openings
were
looking
over
the
lonely
landscape
like
quartermasters
surveying
the
sea
from
the
bridge
within
were
the
armories
and
the
sleeping
rooms
three
rows
of
berths
made
with
planks
like
the
beds
of
seamen
the
desire
for
artistic
ornamentation
which
even
the
simplest
souls
always
feel
had
led
to
the
embellishment
of
the
underground
dwellings
each
soldier
had
a
private
museum
made
with
prints
from
the
papers
and
colored
postcards
photographs
of
soubrettes
and
dancers
with
their
painted
mouths
smiled
from
the
shiny
cardboard
enlivening
the
chaste
aspect
of
the
redoubt
don
marcelo
was
growing
more
and
more
impatient
at
seeing
so
many
hundreds
of
men
but
no
julio
the
senator
complying
with
his
imploring
glance
spoke
a
few
words
to
the
chief
preceding
him
with
an
aspect
of
great
deference
the
official
had
at
first
to
think
very
hard
to
recall
julio
to
mind
but
he
soon
remembered
the
exploits
of
sergeant
desnoyers
an
excellent
soldier
he
said
he
will
be
sent
for
immediately
senator
lacour
he
is
on
duty
now
with
his
section
in
the
first
line
the
father
in
his
anxiety
to
see
him
proposed
that
they
betake
themselves
to
that
advanced
site
but
his
petition
made
the
chief
and
the
others
smile
those
open
trenches
within
a
hundred
or
fifty
yards
from
the
enemy
with
no
other
defence
but
barbed
wire
and
sacks
of
earth
were
not
for
the
visits
of
civilians
they
were
always
filled
with
mud
the
visitors
would
have
to
crawl
around
exposed
to
bullets
and
under
the
dropping
chunks
of
earth
loosened
by
the
shells
none
but
the
combatants
could
get
around
in
these
outposts
it
is
always
dangerous
there
said
the
chief
there
is
always
random
shooting
just
listen
to
the
firing
desnoyers
indeed
perceived
a
distant
crackling
that
he
had
not
noted
before
and
he
felt
an
added
anguish
at
the
thought
that
his
son
must
be
in
the
thick
of
it
realization
of
the
dangers
to
which
he
must
be
daily
exposed
now
stood
forth
in
high
relief
what
if
he
should
die
in
the
intervening
moments
before
he
could
see
him
time
dragged
by
with
desperate
sluggishness
for
don
marcelo
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
messenger
who
had
been
despatched
for
him
would
never
arrive
he
paid
scarcely
any
attention
to
the
affairs
which
the
chief
was
so
courteously
showing
them
the
caverns
which
served
the
soldiers
as
toilet
rooms
and
bathrooms
of
most
primitive
arrangement
the
cave
with
the
sign
cafe
de
la
victoire
another
in
fanciful
lettering
lacour
was
taking
a
lively
interest
in
all
this
lauding
the
french
gaiety
which
laughs
and
sings
in
the
presence
of
danger
while
his
friend
continued
brooding
about
julio
when
would
he
ever
see
him
they
stopped
near
one
of
the
embrasures
of
a
position
stationing
themselves
at
the
recommendations
of
the
soldiers
on
both
sides
of
the
horizontal
opening
keeping
their
bodies
well
back
but
putting
their
heads
far
enough
forward
to
look
out
with
one
eye
they
saw
a
very
deep
excavation
and
the
opposite
edge
of
ground
a
short
distance
away
were
several
rows
of
x
s
of
wood
united
by
barbed
wire
forming
a
compact
fence
about
three
hundred
feet
further
on
was
a
second
wire
fence
there
reigned
a
profound
silence
here
a
silence
of
absolute
loneliness
as
though
the
world
was
asleep
there
are
the
trenches
of
the
boches
said
the
commandant
in
a
low
tone
where
asked
the
senator
making
an
effort
to
see
the
chief
pointed
to
the
second
wire
fence
which
lacour
and
his
friend
had
supposed
belonged
to
the
french
it
was
the
german
intrenchment
line
we
are
only
a
hundred
yards
away
from
them
he
continued
but
for
some
time
they
have
not
been
attacking
from
this
the
visitors
were
greatly
moved
at
learning
that
the
foe
was
such
a
short
distance
off
hidden
in
the
ground
in
a
mysterious
invisibility
which
made
it
all
the
more
terrible
what
if
they
should
pop
out
now
with
their
bayonets
liquids
and
asphyxiating
bombs
to
assault
this
stronghold
from
this
window
they
could
observe
more
clearly
the
intensity
of
the
firing
on
the
outer
line
the
shots
appeared
to
be
coming
nearer
the
commandant
brusquely
ordered
them
to
leave
their
observatory
fearing
that
the
fire
might
become
general
the
soldiers
with
their
customary
promptitude
without
receiving
any
orders
approached
their
guns
which
were
in
horizontal
position
pointing
through
the
loopholes
again
the
visitors
walked
in
single
file
going
down
into
cavernous
spaces
that
had
been
the
old
of
former
houses
the
officers
had
taken
up
their
abode
in
these
dens
utilizing
all
the
residue
of
the
ruins
a
street
door
on
two
wooden
horses
served
as
a
table
the
ceilings
and
walls
were
covered
with
cretonnes
from
the
paris
warehouses
photographs
of
women
and
children
adorned
the
side
wall
between
the
nickeled
glitter
of
telegraphic
and
telephonic
instruments
desnoyers
saw
above
one
door
an
ivory
crucifix
yellowed
with
years
probably
with
centuries
transmitted
from
generation
to
generation
that
must
have
witnessed
many
agonies
of
soul
in
another
den
he
noticed
in
a
conspicuous
place
a
horseshoe
with
seven
holes
religious
creeds
were
spreading
their
wings
very
widely
in
this
atmosphere
of
danger
and
death
and
yet
at
the
same
time
the
most
grotesque
superstitions
were
acquiring
new
values
without
any
one
laughing
at
them
upon
leaving
one
of
the
cells
in
the
middle
of
an
open
space
the
yearning
father
met
his
son
he
knew
that
it
must
be
julio
by
the
chief
s
gesture
and
because
the
smiling
soldier
was
coming
toward
him
holding
out
his
hands
but
this
time
his
paternal
instinct
which
he
had
heretofore
considered
an
infallible
thing
had
given
him
no
warning
how
could
he
recognize
julio
in
that
sergeant
whose
feet
were
two
cakes
of
moist
earth
whose
faded
cloak
was
a
mass
of
tatters
covered
with
mud
even
up
to
the
shoulders
smelling
of
damp
wool
and
leather
after
the
first
embrace
he
drew
back
his
head
in
order
to
get
a
good
look
at
him
without
letting
go
of
him
his
olive
pallor
had
turned
to
a
bronze
tone
he
was
growing
a
beard
a
beard
black
and
curly
which
reminded
don
marcelo
of
his
the
centaur
madariaga
had
certainly
come
to
life
in
this
warrior
hardened
by
camping
in
the
open
air
at
first
the
father
grieved
over
his
dirty
and
tired
aspect
but
a
second
glance
made
him
sure
that
he
was
now
far
more
handsome
and
interesting
than
in
his
days
of
society
glory
what
do
you
need
what
do
you
want
his
voice
was
trembling
with
tenderness
he
was
speaking
to
the
tanned
and
robust
combatant
in
the
same
tone
that
he
was
wont
to
use
twenty
years
ago
when
holding
the
child
by
the
hand
he
had
halted
before
the
preserve
cupboards
of
buenos
aires
would
you
like
money
he
had
brought
a
large
sum
with
him
to
give
to
his
son
but
the
soldier
gave
a
shrug
of
indifference
as
though
he
had
offered
him
a
plaything
he
had
never
been
so
rich
as
at
this
moment
he
had
a
lot
of
money
in
paris
and
he
didn
t
know
what
to
do
with
it
he
didn
t
need
anything
send
me
some
cigars
for
me
and
my
he
was
constantly
receiving
from
his
mother
great
baskets
full
of
choice
goodies
tobacco
and
clothing
but
he
never
kept
anything
all
was
passed
on
to
his
sons
of
poor
families
or
alone
in
the
world
his
munificence
had
spread
from
his
intimates
to
the
company
and
from
that
to
the
entire
battalion
don
marcelo
divined
his
great
popularity
in
the
glances
and
smiles
of
the
soldiers
passing
near
them
he
was
the
generous
son
of
a
millionaire
and
this
popularity
seemed
to
include
even
him
when
the
news
went
around
that
the
father
of
sergeant
desnoyers
had
arrived
a
potentate
who
possessed
fabulous
wealth
on
the
other
side
of
the
sea
i
guessed
that
you
would
want
cigars
chuckled
the
old
man
and
his
gaze
sought
the
bags
brought
from
the
automobile
through
the
windings
of
the
underground
road
all
of
the
son
s
valorous
deeds
extolled
and
magnified
by
argensola
now
came
trooping
into
his
mind
he
had
the
original
hero
before
his
very
eyes
are
you
content
satisfied
you
do
not
repent
of
your
decision
yes
i
am
content
father
very
julio
spoke
without
boasting
modestly
his
life
was
very
hard
but
just
like
that
of
millions
of
other
men
in
his
section
of
a
few
dozens
of
soldiers
there
were
many
superior
to
him
in
intelligence
in
studiousness
in
character
but
they
were
all
courageously
undergoing
the
test
experiencing
the
satisfaction
of
duty
fulfilled
the
common
danger
was
helping
to
develop
the
noblest
virtues
of
these
men
never
in
times
of
peace
had
he
known
such
comradeship
what
magnificent
sacrifices
he
had
witnessed
when
all
this
is
over
men
will
be
better
more
generous
those
who
survive
will
do
great
yes
of
course
he
was
content
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
he
was
tasting
the
delights
of
knowing
that
he
was
a
useful
being
that
he
was
good
for
something
that
his
passing
through
the
world
would
not
be
fruitless
he
recalled
with
pity
that
desnoyers
who
had
not
known
how
to
occupy
his
empty
life
and
had
filled
it
with
every
kind
of
frivolity
now
he
had
obligations
that
were
taxing
all
his
powers
he
was
collaborating
in
the
formation
of
a
future
he
was
a
man
at
last
i
am
content
he
repeated
with
conviction
his
father
believed
him
yet
he
fancied
that
in
a
corner
of
that
frank
glance
he
detected
something
sorrowful
a
memory
of
a
past
which
perhaps
often
forced
its
way
among
his
present
emotions
there
flitted
through
his
mind
the
lovely
figure
of
madame
laurier
her
charm
was
doubtless
still
haunting
his
son
and
to
think
that
he
could
not
bring
her
here
the
austere
father
of
the
preceding
year
contemplated
himself
with
astonishment
as
he
caught
himself
formulating
this
immoral
regret
they
passed
a
quarter
of
an
hour
without
loosening
hands
looking
into
each
other
s
eyes
julio
asked
after
his
mother
and
chichi
he
frequently
received
letters
from
them
but
that
was
not
enough
for
his
curiosity
he
laughed
heartily
at
hearing
of
argensola
s
amplified
and
abundant
life
these
interesting
bits
of
news
came
from
a
world
not
much
more
than
sixty
miles
distant
in
a
direct
line
but
so
far
so
very
far
away
suddenly
the
father
noticed
that
his
boy
was
listening
with
less
attention
his
senses
sharpened
by
a
life
of
alarms
and
ambushed
attacks
appeared
to
be
withdrawing
itself
from
the
company
attracted
by
the
firing
those
were
no
longer
scattered
shots
they
had
combined
into
a
continual
crackling
the
senator
who
had
left
father
and
son
together
that
they
might
talk
more
freely
now
reappeared
we
are
dismissed
from
here
my
friend
he
announced
we
have
no
luck
in
our
soldiers
were
no
longer
passing
to
and
fro
all
had
hastened
to
their
posts
like
the
crew
of
a
ship
which
clears
for
action
while
julio
was
taking
up
the
rifle
which
he
had
left
against
the
wall
a
bit
of
dust
whirled
above
his
father
s
head
and
a
little
hole
appeared
in
the
ground
quick
get
out
of
here
he
said
pushing
don
marcelo
then
in
the
shelter
of
a
covered
trench
came
the
nervous
very
brief
farewell
father
a
kiss
and
he
was
gone
he
had
to
return
as
quickly
as
possible
to
the
side
of
his
men
the
firing
had
become
general
all
along
the
line
the
soldiers
were
shooting
serenely
as
though
fulfilling
an
ordinary
function
it
was
a
combat
that
took
place
every
day
without
anybody
s
knowing
exactly
who
started
it
in
consequence
of
the
two
armies
being
installed
face
to
face
and
such
a
short
distance
apart
the
chief
of
the
battalion
was
also
obliged
to
desert
his
guests
fearing
a
again
the
officer
charged
with
their
safe
conduct
put
himself
at
the
head
of
the
file
and
they
began
to
retrace
their
steps
through
the
slippery
maze
desnoyers
was
tramping
sullenly
on
angry
at
the
intervention
of
the
enemy
which
had
cut
short
his
happiness
before
his
inward
gaze
fluttered
the
vision
of
julio
with
his
black
curly
beard
which
to
him
was
the
greatest
novelty
of
the
trip
he
heard
again
his
grave
voice
that
of
a
man
who
has
taken
up
life
from
a
new
viewpoint
i
am
content
father
i
am
the
firing
growing
constantly
more
distant
gave
the
father
great
uneasiness
then
he
felt
an
instinctive
faith
absurd
very
firm
he
saw
his
son
beautiful
and
immortal
as
a
god
he
had
a
conviction
that
he
would
come
out
safe
and
sound
from
all
dangers
that
others
should
die
was
but
natural
but
julio
as
they
got
further
and
further
away
from
the
soldier
boy
hope
appeared
to
be
singing
in
his
ears
and
as
an
echo
of
his
pleasing
musings
the
father
kept
repeating
mentally
no
one
will
kill
him
my
heart
which
never
deceives
me
tells
me
so
no
one
will
kill
him
chapter
iv
no
one
will
kill
him
four
months
later
don
marcelo
s
confidence
received
a
rude
shock
julio
was
wounded
but
at
the
same
time
that
lacour
bought
him
this
news
lamentably
delayed
he
tranquilized
him
with
the
result
of
his
investigations
in
the
war
ministry
sergeant
desnoyers
was
now
a
his
wound
was
almost
healed
and
thanks
to
the
of
the
senator
he
was
coming
to
pass
a
fortnight
with
his
family
while
convalescing
an
exceptionally
brave
fellow
concluded
the
influential
man
i
have
read
what
his
chiefs
say
about
him
at
the
head
of
his
platoon
he
attacked
a
german
company
he
killed
the
captain
with
his
own
hand
he
did
i
don
t
know
how
many
more
brave
things
besides
they
have
presented
him
with
the
military
medal
and
have
made
him
an
officer
a
regular
hero
and
the
rapidly
aging
father
weeping
with
emotion
but
with
increasing
enthusiasm
shook
his
head
and
trembled
he
repented
now
of
his
momentary
lack
of
faith
when
the
first
news
of
his
wounded
boy
reached
him
how
absurd
no
one
would
kill
julio
his
heart
told
him
so
soon
after
he
saw
him
coming
home
amid
the
cries
and
delighted
exclamations
of
the
women
poor
dona
luisa
wept
as
she
embraced
him
hanging
on
his
neck
with
sobs
of
emotion
chichi
contemplated
him
with
grave
reflection
putting
half
of
her
mind
on
the
recent
arrival
while
the
rest
flew
far
away
in
search
of
the
other
warrior
the
dusky
south
american
maids
fought
each
other
for
the
opening
in
the
curtains
peering
through
the
crack
with
the
gaze
of
an
antelope
the
father
admired
the
little
scrap
of
gold
on
the
sleeve
of
the
gray
cloak
with
the
skirts
buttoning
behind
examining
afterwards
the
dark
blue
cap
with
its
low
brim
adopted
by
the
french
for
the
war
in
the
trenches
the
traditional
kepi
had
disappeared
a
suitable
visor
like
that
of
the
men
in
the
spanish
infantry
now
shadowed
julio
s
face
don
marcelo
noted
too
the
short
and
beard
very
different
from
the
one
he
had
seen
in
the
trenches
the
boy
was
coming
home
groomed
and
polished
from
his
recent
stay
in
the
hospital
isn
t
it
true
that
he
looks
like
me
queried
the
old
man
proudly
dona
luisa
responded
with
the
inconsequence
that
mothers
always
show
in
matters
of
resemblance
he
has
always
been
the
living
image
of
you
having
made
sure
that
he
was
well
and
happy
the
entire
family
suddenly
felt
a
certain
disquietude
they
wished
to
examine
his
wound
so
as
to
convince
themselves
that
he
was
completely
out
of
danger
oh
it
s
nothing
at
all
protested
the
a
bullet
wound
in
the
shoulder
the
doctor
feared
at
first
that
i
might
lose
my
left
arm
but
it
has
healed
well
and
it
isn
t
worth
while
to
think
any
more
about
chichi
s
appraising
glance
swept
julio
from
head
to
foot
taking
in
all
the
details
of
his
military
elegance
his
cloak
was
worn
thin
and
dirty
the
leggings
were
with
mud
he
smelled
of
leather
sweaty
cloth
and
strong
tobacco
but
on
one
wrist
he
was
wearing
a
watch
and
on
the
other
his
identity
medal
fastened
with
a
gold
chain
she
had
always
admired
her
brother
for
his
natural
good
taste
so
she
stowed
away
all
these
little
details
in
her
memory
in
order
to
pass
them
on
to
rene
then
she
surprised
her
mother
with
a
demand
for
a
loan
that
she
might
send
a
little
gift
to
her
artilleryman
don
marcelo
gloated
over
the
fifteen
days
of
satisfaction
ahead
of
him
desnoyers
found
it
impossible
to
go
out
alone
for
his
father
was
always
pacing
up
and
down
the
reception
hall
before
the
military
cap
which
was
shedding
modest
splendor
and
glory
upon
the
hat
rack
scarcely
had
julio
put
it
on
his
head
before
his
sire
appeared
also
with
hat
and
cane
ready
to
sally
forth
will
you
permit
me
to
accompany
you
i
will
not
bother
this
would
be
said
so
humbly
with
such
an
evident
desire
to
have
his
request
granted
that
his
son
had
not
the
heart
to
refuse
him
in
order
to
take
a
walk
with
argensola
he
had
to
scurry
down
the
back
stairs
or
resort
to
other
schoolboy
tricks
never
had
the
elder
desnoyers
promenaded
the
streets
of
paris
with
such
solid
satisfaction
as
by
the
side
of
this
muscular
youth
in
his
gloriously
worn
cloak
on
whose
breast
were
glistening
his
two
decorations
the
cross
of
war
and
the
military
medal
he
was
a
hero
and
this
hero
was
his
son
he
accepted
as
homage
to
them
both
the
sympathetic
glances
of
the
public
in
the
street
cars
and
subways
the
interest
with
which
the
women
regarded
the
youth
tickled
him
immensely
all
the
other
military
men
that
they
met
no
matter
how
many
bands
and
crosses
they
displayed
appeared
to
the
doting
father
mere
embusques
unworthy
of
comparison
with
his
julio
the
wounded
men
who
got
out
of
the
coaches
by
the
aid
of
staffs
and
crutches
inspired
him
with
the
greatest
pity
poor
fellows
they
did
not
bear
the
charmed
life
of
his
son
nobody
could
kill
him
and
when
by
chance
he
had
received
a
wound
the
scars
had
immediately
disappeared
without
detriment
to
his
handsome
person
sometimes
especially
at
night
desnoyers
senior
would
show
an
unexpected
magnanimity
letting
julio
fare
forth
alone
since
before
the
war
his
son
had
led
a
life
filled
with
triumphant
what
might
he
not
achieve
now
with
the
added
prestige
of
a
distinguished
officer
passing
through
his
room
on
his
way
to
bed
the
father
imagined
the
hero
in
the
charming
company
of
some
aristocratic
lady
none
but
a
feminine
celebrity
was
worthy
of
him
his
paternal
pride
could
accept
nothing
less
and
it
never
occurred
to
him
that
julio
might
be
with
argensola
in
a
or
in
a
show
enjoying
the
simple
and
monotonous
diversions
of
a
paris
sobered
by
war
with
the
homely
tastes
of
a
whose
amorous
conquests
were
no
more
than
the
renewal
of
some
old
friendships
one
evening
as
don
marcelo
was
accompanying
his
son
down
the
champs
elysees
he
started
at
recognizing
a
lady
approaching
from
the
opposite
direction
it
was
madame
laurier
would
she
recognize
julio
he
noted
that
the
youth
turned
pale
and
began
looking
at
the
other
people
with
feigned
interest
she
continued
straight
ahead
erect
unseeing
the
old
gentleman
was
almost
irritated
at
such
coldness
to
pass
by
his
son
without
feeling
his
presence
instinctively
ah
these
women
he
turned
his
head
involuntarily
to
look
after
her
but
had
to
avert
his
inquisitive
glance
immediately
he
had
surprised
marguerite
motionless
behind
them
pallid
with
surprise
and
fixing
her
gaze
earnestly
on
the
soldier
who
was
separating
himself
from
her
don
marcelo
read
in
her
eyes
admiration
love
all
of
the
past
that
was
suddenly
surging
up
in
her
memory
poor
woman
he
felt
for
her
a
paternal
affection
as
though
she
were
the
wife
of
julio
his
friend
lacour
had
again
spoken
to
him
about
the
lauriers
he
knew
that
marguerite
was
going
to
become
a
mother
and
the
old
man
without
taking
into
account
the
reconciliation
nor
the
passage
of
time
felt
as
much
moved
at
the
thought
of
this
approaching
maternity
as
though
the
child
were
going
to
be
julio
s
meanwhile
julio
was
marching
right
on
without
turning
his
head
without
being
conscious
of
the
burning
gaze
fixed
upon
him
colorless
but
humming
a
tune
to
hide
his
emotion
he
always
believed
that
marguerite
had
passed
near
him
without
recognizing
him
since
his
father
did
not
betray
her
one
of
don
marcelo
s
pet
occupations
was
to
make
his
son
tell
about
the
encounter
in
which
he
had
been
hurt
no
visitor
ever
came
to
see
the
but
the
father
always
made
the
same
petition
tell
us
how
you
were
wounded
explain
how
you
killed
that
german
julio
tried
to
excuse
himself
with
visible
annoyance
he
was
already
surfeited
with
his
own
history
to
please
his
father
he
had
related
the
facts
to
the
senator
to
argensola
and
to
tchernoff
in
his
studio
and
to
other
family
friends
he
simply
could
not
do
it
again
so
the
father
began
the
narration
on
his
own
account
giving
the
relief
and
details
of
the
deed
as
though
seen
with
his
own
eyes
he
had
to
take
possession
of
the
ruins
of
a
sugar
refinery
in
front
of
the
trench
the
germans
had
been
expelled
by
the
french
cannon
a
reconnoitring
survey
under
the
charge
of
a
trusty
man
was
then
necessary
and
the
heads
as
usual
had
selected
sergeant
desnoyers
at
daybreak
the
platoon
had
advanced
stealthily
without
encountering
any
difficulty
the
soldiers
scattered
among
the
ruins
julio
then
went
on
alone
examining
the
positions
of
the
enemy
on
turning
around
a
corner
of
the
wall
he
had
the
most
unexpected
of
encounters
a
german
captain
was
standing
in
front
of
him
they
had
almost
bumped
into
each
other
they
looked
into
each
other
s
eyes
with
more
suspense
than
hate
yet
at
the
same
time
they
were
trying
instinctively
to
kill
each
other
each
one
trying
to
get
the
advantage
by
his
swiftness
the
captain
had
dropped
the
map
that
he
was
carrying
his
right
hand
sought
his
revolver
trying
to
draw
it
from
its
case
without
once
taking
his
eyes
off
his
enemy
then
he
had
to
give
this
up
as
useless
it
was
too
late
with
his
eyes
distended
by
the
proximity
of
death
he
kept
his
gaze
fixed
upon
the
frenchman
who
had
raised
his
gun
to
his
face
a
shot
from
a
barrel
almost
touching
him
and
the
german
fell
dead
not
till
then
did
the
victor
notice
the
captain
s
orderly
who
was
but
a
few
steps
behind
he
shot
desnoyers
wounding
him
in
the
shoulder
the
french
hurried
to
the
spot
killing
the
corporal
then
there
was
a
sharp
with
the
enemy
s
company
which
had
halted
a
little
ways
off
while
their
commander
was
exploring
the
ground
julio
in
spite
of
his
wound
continued
at
the
head
of
his
section
defending
the
factory
against
superior
forces
until
supports
arrived
and
the
land
remained
definitely
in
the
power
of
the
french
wasn
t
that
about
the
way
of
it
don
marcelo
would
always
wind
up
the
son
assented
desirous
that
his
annoyance
with
the
persistent
story
should
come
to
an
end
as
soon
as
possible
yes
that
was
the
way
of
it
but
what
the
father
didn
t
know
what
julio
would
never
tell
was
the
discovery
that
he
had
made
after
killing
the
captain
the
two
men
during
the
interminable
second
in
which
they
had
confronted
each
other
had
showed
in
their
eyes
something
more
than
the
surprise
of
an
encounter
and
the
wish
to
overcome
the
other
desnoyers
knew
that
man
the
captain
knew
him
too
he
guessed
it
from
his
expression
but
was
more
insistent
than
recollection
and
prevented
them
both
from
their
thoughts
desnoyers
had
fired
with
the
certainty
that
he
was
killing
someone
that
he
knew
afterwards
while
directing
the
defense
of
the
position
and
guarding
against
the
approach
of
reinforcements
he
had
a
suspicion
that
the
enemy
whose
corpse
was
lying
a
few
feet
away
might
possibly
be
a
member
of
the
von
hartrott
family
no
he
looked
much
older
than
his
cousins
yet
younger
than
his
uncle
karl
who
at
his
age
would
be
no
mere
captain
of
infantry
when
weakened
by
the
loss
of
blood
they
were
about
to
carry
him
to
the
trenches
the
sergeant
expressed
a
wish
to
see
again
the
body
of
his
victim
his
doubt
continued
before
the
face
blanched
by
death
the
eyes
still
seemed
to
retain
their
startled
expression
the
man
had
undoubtedly
recognized
him
his
face
was
familiar
who
was
he
suddenly
in
his
mind
s
eye
julio
saw
the
heaving
ocean
a
great
steamer
a
tall
blonde
woman
looking
at
him
with
eyes
of
invitation
a
corpulent
moustached
man
making
speeches
in
the
style
of
the
kaiser
rest
in
peace
captain
erckmann
thus
culminated
in
a
corner
of
france
the
discussions
started
at
table
in
he
excused
himself
mentally
as
though
he
were
in
the
presence
of
the
sweet
bertha
he
had
had
to
kill
in
order
not
to
be
killed
such
is
war
he
tried
to
console
himself
by
thinking
that
erckmann
perhaps
had
failed
to
identify
him
without
realizing
that
his
slayer
was
the
shipmate
of
the
summer
and
he
kept
carefully
hidden
in
the
depths
of
his
memory
this
encounter
arranged
by
fate
he
did
not
even
tell
argensola
who
knew
of
the
incidents
of
the
passage
when
he
least
expected
it
don
marcelo
found
himself
at
the
end
of
that
delightful
and
proud
existence
which
his
son
s
presence
had
brought
him
the
fortnight
had
flown
by
so
swiftly
the
had
returned
to
his
post
and
all
the
family
after
this
period
of
reality
had
had
to
fall
back
on
the
fond
illusions
of
hope
watching
again
for
the
arrival
of
his
letters
making
conjectures
about
the
silence
of
the
absent
one
sending
him
packet
after
packet
of
everything
that
the
market
was
offering
for
the
soldiery
for
the
most
part
useless
and
absurd
things
the
mother
became
very
despondent
julio
s
visit
home
but
made
her
feel
his
absence
with
greater
intensity
seeing
him
hearing
those
tales
of
death
that
her
husband
was
so
fond
of
repeating
made
her
realize
all
the
more
clearly
the
dangers
constantly
surrounding
her
son
fatality
appeared
to
be
warning
her
with
funereal
presentiments
they
are
going
to
kill
him
she
kept
saying
to
desnoyers
that
wound
was
a
forewarning
from
when
passing
through
the
streets
she
trembled
with
emotion
at
sight
of
the
invalid
soldiers
the
convalescents
of
energetic
appearance
filled
her
with
the
greatest
pity
they
made
her
think
of
a
certain
trip
with
her
husband
to
san
sebastian
where
a
bull
fight
had
made
her
cry
out
with
indignation
and
compassion
pitying
the
fate
of
the
poor
gored
horses
with
entrails
hanging
they
were
taken
to
the
corrals
and
submitted
to
a
hurried
adjustment
in
order
that
they
might
return
to
the
arena
stimulated
by
a
false
energy
again
and
again
they
were
reduced
to
this
makeshift
cobbling
until
finally
a
fatal
goring
finished
them
these
recently
cured
men
continually
brought
to
her
mind
those
poor
beasts
some
had
been
wounded
three
times
since
the
beginning
of
the
war
and
were
returning
surgically
patched
together
and
to
take
another
chance
in
the
lottery
of
fate
always
in
the
expectation
of
the
supreme
blow
ay
her
son
desnoyers
waxed
very
indignant
over
his
wife
s
low
spirits
retorting
but
i
tell
you
that
nobody
will
kill
julio
he
is
my
son
in
my
youth
i
too
passed
through
great
dangers
they
wounded
me
too
in
the
wars
in
the
other
world
and
nevertheless
here
i
am
at
a
ripe
old
events
seemed
to
reinforce
his
blind
faith
calamities
were
raining
around
the
family
and
saddening
his
relatives
yet
not
one
grazed
the
intrepid
who
was
persisting
in
his
daring
deeds
with
the
heroic
nerve
of
a
musketeer
dona
luisa
received
a
letter
from
germany
her
sister
wrote
from
berlin
transmitting
her
letters
through
the
kindness
of
a
south
american
in
switzerland
this
time
the
good
lady
wept
for
some
one
besides
her
son
she
wept
for
elena
and
the
enemies
in
germany
there
were
mothers
too
and
she
put
the
sentiment
of
maternity
above
all
patriotic
differences
poor
frau
von
hartrott
her
letter
written
a
month
before
had
contained
nothing
but
death
notices
and
words
of
despair
captain
otto
was
dead
dead
too
was
one
of
his
younger
brothers
the
fact
that
the
latter
had
fallen
in
a
territory
dominated
by
their
nation
at
least
gave
the
mother
the
sad
comfort
of
being
able
to
weep
near
his
grave
but
the
captain
was
buried
on
french
soil
nobody
knew
where
and
she
would
never
be
able
to
find
his
remains
mingled
with
hundreds
of
others
a
third
son
was
wounded
in
poland
her
two
daughters
had
lost
their
promised
lovers
and
the
sight
of
their
silent
grief
was
intensifying
the
mother
s
suffering
von
hartrott
continued
presiding
over
patriotic
societies
and
making
plans
of
expansion
after
the
near
victory
but
he
had
aged
greatly
in
the
last
few
months
the
sage
was
the
only
one
still
holding
his
own
the
family
afflictions
were
aggravating
the
ferocity
of
professor
julius
von
hartrott
he
was
calculating
in
a
book
he
was
writing
the
hundreds
of
thousands
of
millions
that
germany
must
exact
after
her
triumph
and
the
various
nations
that
she
would
have
to
annex
to
the
fatherland
dona
luisa
imagined
that
in
the
avenue
victor
hugo
she
could
hear
the
mother
s
tears
falling
in
her
home
in
berlin
you
will
understand
luisa
my
despair
we
were
all
so
happy
may
god
punish
those
who
have
brought
such
sorrow
on
the
world
the
emperor
is
innocent
his
adversaries
are
to
blame
for
it
all
don
marcelo
was
silent
about
the
letter
in
his
wife
s
presence
he
pitied
elena
for
her
losses
so
he
overlooked
her
political
connections
he
was
touched
too
at
dona
luisa
s
distress
about
otto
she
had
been
his
godmother
and
desnoyers
his
godfather
that
was
so
don
marcelo
had
forgotten
all
about
it
and
the
fact
recalled
to
his
mental
vision
the
placid
life
of
the
ranch
and
the
play
of
the
blonde
children
that
he
had
petted
behind
their
grandfather
s
back
before
julio
was
born
for
many
years
he
had
lavished
great
affection
on
these
youngsters
when
dismayed
at
julio
s
delayed
arrival
he
was
really
affected
at
thinking
of
what
must
be
karl
s
despair
but
then
as
soon
as
he
was
alone
a
selfish
coldness
would
blot
out
this
compassion
war
was
war
and
the
germans
had
sought
it
france
had
to
defend
herself
and
the
more
enemies
fell
the
better
the
only
soldier
who
interested
him
now
was
julio
and
his
faith
in
the
destiny
of
his
son
made
him
feel
a
brutal
joy
a
paternal
satisfaction
almost
amounting
to
ferocity
no
one
will
kill
him
my
heart
tells
me
a
nearer
trouble
shook
his
peace
of
mind
when
he
returned
to
his
home
one
evening
he
found
dona
luisa
with
a
terrified
aspect
holding
her
hands
to
her
head
the
daughter
marcelo
our
daughter
chichi
was
stretched
out
on
a
sofa
in
the
salon
pale
with
an
olive
tinge
looking
fixedly
ahead
of
her
as
if
she
could
see
somebody
in
the
empty
air
she
was
not
crying
but
a
slight
palpitation
was
making
her
swollen
eyes
tremble
spasmodically
i
want
to
see
him
she
was
saying
hoarsely
i
must
see
him
the
father
conjectured
that
something
terrible
must
have
happened
to
lacour
s
son
that
was
the
only
thing
that
could
make
chichi
show
such
desperation
his
wife
was
telling
him
the
sad
news
rene
was
wounded
very
seriously
wounded
a
shell
had
exploded
over
his
battery
killing
many
of
his
comrades
the
young
officer
had
been
dragged
out
from
a
mountain
of
dead
one
hand
was
gone
he
had
injuries
in
the
legs
chest
and
head
i
ve
got
to
see
him
reiterated
chichi
and
don
marcelo
had
to
concentrate
all
his
efforts
in
making
his
daughter
give
up
this
dolorous
insistence
which
made
her
exact
an
immediate
journey
to
the
front
trampling
down
all
obstacles
in
order
to
reach
her
wounded
lover
the
senator
finally
convinced
her
of
the
uselessness
of
it
all
she
would
simply
have
to
wait
he
the
father
had
to
be
patient
he
was
negotiating
for
rene
to
be
transferred
to
a
hospital
in
paris
the
great
man
moved
desnoyers
to
pity
he
was
making
such
heroic
efforts
to
preserve
the
stoic
serenity
of
ancient
days
by
recalling
his
glorious
ancestors
and
all
the
illustrious
figures
of
the
roman
republic
but
these
oratorical
illusions
had
suddenly
fallen
flat
and
his
old
friend
surprised
him
weeping
more
than
once
an
only
child
and
he
might
have
to
lose
him
chichi
s
dumb
woe
made
him
feel
even
greater
commiseration
her
grief
was
without
tears
or
faintings
her
sallow
face
the
feverish
brilliancy
of
her
eyes
and
the
rigidity
that
made
her
move
like
an
automaton
were
the
only
signs
of
her
emotion
she
was
living
with
her
thoughts
far
away
with
no
knowledge
of
what
was
going
on
around
her
when
the
patient
arrived
in
paris
his
father
and
fiancee
were
transfigured
they
were
going
to
see
him
and
that
was
enough
to
make
them
imagine
that
he
was
already
recuperated
chichi
hastened
to
the
hospital
with
her
mother
and
the
senator
then
she
went
alone
and
insisted
on
remaining
there
on
living
at
the
wounded
man
s
side
waging
war
on
all
regulations
and
clashing
with
sisters
of
charity
trained
nurses
and
all
who
roused
in
her
the
hatred
of
rivalry
soon
realizing
that
all
her
violence
accomplished
nothing
she
humiliated
herself
and
became
suddenly
very
submissive
trying
with
her
wiles
to
win
the
women
over
one
by
one
finally
she
was
permitted
to
spend
the
greater
part
of
the
day
with
rene
when
desnoyers
first
saw
the
wounded
artilleryman
in
bed
he
had
to
make
a
great
effort
to
keep
the
tears
back
ay
his
son
too
might
be
brought
to
this
sad
pass
the
man
looked
to
him
like
an
egyptian
mummy
because
of
his
complete
envelopment
in
tight
bandage
wrappings
the
sharp
hulls
of
the
shell
had
fairly
riddled
him
there
could
only
be
seen
a
pair
of
sweet
eyes
and
a
blond
bit
of
moustache
sticking
up
between
white
bands
the
poor
fellow
was
trying
to
smile
at
chichi
who
was
hovering
around
him
with
a
certain
authority
as
though
she
were
in
her
own
home
two
months
rolled
by
rene
was
better
almost
well
his
betrothed
had
never
doubted
his
recovery
from
the
moment
that
they
permitted
her
to
remain
with
him
no
one
that
i
love
ever
dies
she
asserted
with
a
ring
of
her
father
s
as
if
i
would
ever
permit
the
boches
to
leave
me
without
a
husband
she
had
her
little
sugar
soldier
back
again
but
oh
in
what
a
lamentable
state
never
had
don
marcelo
realized
the
horrors
of
war
as
when
he
saw
entering
his
home
this
convalescent
whom
he
had
known
months
before
elegant
and
slender
with
a
delicate
and
somewhat
feminine
beauty
his
face
was
now
furrowed
by
a
network
of
scars
that
had
transformed
it
into
a
purplish
arabesque
within
his
body
were
hidden
many
such
his
left
hand
had
disappeared
with
a
part
of
the
forearm
the
empty
sleeve
hanging
over
the
remainder
the
other
hand
was
supported
on
a
cane
a
necessary
aid
in
order
to
be
able
to
move
a
leg
that
would
never
recover
its
elasticity
but
chichi
was
content
she
surveyed
her
dear
little
soldier
with
more
enthusiasm
than
ever
a
little
deformed
perhaps
but
very
interesting
with
her
mother
she
accompanied
the
convalescent
in
his
constitutionals
through
the
bois
de
boulogne
when
in
crossing
a
street
automobilists
or
coachmen
failed
to
stop
their
vehicles
in
order
to
give
the
invalid
the
right
of
way
her
eyes
shot
lightning
shafts
as
she
thundered
shameless
embusques
she
was
now
feeling
the
same
fiery
resentment
as
those
women
of
former
days
who
used
to
insult
her
rene
when
he
was
well
and
happy
she
trembled
with
satisfaction
and
pride
when
returning
the
greetings
of
her
friends
her
eloquent
eyes
seemed
to
be
saying
yes
he
is
my
betrothed
a
hero
she
was
constantly
arranging
the
war
cross
on
his
blouse
of
horizon
blue
taking
pains
to
place
it
as
conspicuously
as
possible
she
also
spent
much
time
in
prolonging
the
life
of
his
shabby
uniform
always
the
same
one
the
old
one
which
he
was
wearing
when
wounded
a
new
one
would
give
him
the
officery
look
of
the
soldiers
who
never
left
paris
as
he
grew
stronger
rene
vainly
tried
to
emancipate
himself
from
her
dominant
supervision
it
was
simply
useless
to
try
to
walk
with
more
celerity
or
freedom
lean
on
me
and
he
had
to
take
his
fiancee
s
arm
all
her
plans
for
the
future
were
based
on
the
devotion
with
which
she
was
going
to
protect
her
husband
on
the
solicitude
that
she
was
going
to
dedicate
to
his
crippled
condition
my
poor
dear
invalid
she
would
murmur
lovingly
so
ugly
and
so
helpless
those
blackguards
have
left
you
but
luckily
you
have
me
and
i
adore
you
it
makes
no
difference
to
me
that
one
of
your
hands
is
gone
i
will
care
for
you
you
shall
be
my
little
son
you
will
just
see
after
we
are
married
how
elegant
and
stylish
i
am
going
to
keep
you
but
don
t
you
dare
to
look
at
any
of
the
other
women
the
very
first
moment
that
you
do
my
precious
little
invalid
i
ll
leave
you
alone
in
your
helplessness
desnoyers
and
the
senator
were
also
concerned
about
their
future
but
in
a
very
definite
way
they
must
be
married
as
soon
as
possible
what
was
the
use
of
waiting
the
war
was
no
longer
an
obstacle
they
would
be
married
as
quietly
as
possible
this
was
no
time
for
wedding
pomp
so
rene
lacour
remained
permanently
in
the
house
on
the
avenida
victor
hugo
after
the
nuptial
ceremony
witnessed
by
a
dozen
people
don
marcelo
had
had
dreams
of
other
things
for
his
daughter
a
grand
wedding
to
which
the
daily
papers
would
devote
much
space
a
with
a
brilliant
future
but
ay
this
war
everybody
was
having
his
fondest
hopes
dashed
to
pieces
every
few
hours
he
took
what
comfort
he
could
out
of
the
situation
what
more
did
they
want
chichi
was
happy
with
a
rollicking
and
selfish
happiness
which
took
no
interest
in
anything
but
her
own
the
desnoyers
business
returns
could
not
be
improved
upon
after
the
first
crisis
had
passed
the
necessities
of
the
belligerents
had
begun
utilizing
the
output
of
his
ranches
and
never
before
had
meat
brought
such
high
prices
money
was
flowing
in
with
greater
volume
than
formerly
while
the
expenses
were
diminishing
julio
was
in
daily
danger
of
death
but
the
old
ranchman
was
buoyed
up
by
his
conviction
that
his
son
led
a
charmed
life
no
harm
could
touch
him
his
chief
preoccupation
therefore
was
to
keep
himself
tranquil
avoiding
all
emotional
storms
he
had
been
reading
with
considerable
alarm
of
the
frequency
with
which
persons
politicians
artists
and
writers
were
dying
in
paris
war
was
not
doing
all
its
killing
at
the
front
its
shocks
were
falling
like
arrows
over
the
land
causing
the
fall
of
the
weak
the
crushed
and
the
exhausted
who
in
normal
times
would
probably
have
lived
to
a
far
greater
age
attention
marcelo
he
said
to
himself
with
grim
humor
keep
cool
now
you
must
avoid
friend
tchernoff
s
four
horsemen
you
know
he
spent
an
afternoon
in
the
studio
going
over
the
war
news
in
the
papers
the
french
had
begun
an
offensive
in
champagne
with
great
advances
and
many
prisoners
desnoyers
could
not
but
think
of
the
loss
of
life
that
this
must
represent
julio
s
fate
however
gave
him
no
uneasiness
for
his
son
was
not
in
that
part
of
the
front
but
yesterday
he
had
received
a
letter
from
him
dated
the
week
before
they
all
took
about
that
length
of
time
to
reach
him
desnoyers
was
as
blithe
and
reckless
as
ever
they
were
going
to
promote
him
again
he
was
among
those
proposed
for
the
legion
d
honneur
these
facts
intensified
don
marcelo
s
vision
of
himself
as
the
father
of
a
general
as
young
as
those
of
the
revolution
and
as
he
contemplated
the
daubs
and
sketches
around
him
he
marvelled
at
the
extraordinary
way
in
which
the
war
had
twisted
his
son
s
career
on
his
way
home
he
passed
marguerite
laurier
dressed
in
mourning
the
senator
had
told
him
a
few
days
before
that
her
brother
the
artilleryman
had
just
been
killed
at
verdun
how
many
are
falling
he
said
mournfully
to
himself
how
hard
it
will
be
for
his
poor
mother
but
he
smiled
immediately
after
at
the
thought
of
those
to
be
born
never
before
had
the
people
been
so
occupied
in
accelerating
their
reproduction
even
madame
laurier
now
showed
with
pride
the
very
visible
curves
of
her
approaching
maternity
and
desnoyers
noted
sympathetically
the
vital
volume
apparent
beneath
her
long
mourning
veil
again
he
thought
of
julio
without
taking
into
account
the
flight
of
time
he
felt
as
interested
in
the
little
newcomer
as
though
he
were
in
some
way
related
to
it
and
he
promised
himself
to
aid
generously
the
laurier
baby
if
he
ever
had
the
opportunity
on
entering
his
house
he
was
met
in
the
hall
by
dona
luisa
who
told
him
that
lacour
was
waiting
for
him
very
good
he
responded
gaily
let
us
see
what
our
illustrious
has
to
his
good
wife
was
uneasy
she
had
felt
alarmed
without
knowing
exactly
why
at
the
senator
s
solemn
appearance
with
that
feminine
instinct
which
perforates
all
masculine
precautions
she
surmised
some
hidden
mission
she
had
noticed
too
that
rene
and
his
father
were
talking
together
in
a
low
tone
with
repressed
emotion
moved
by
an
irresistible
impulse
she
hovered
near
the
closed
door
hoping
to
hear
something
definite
her
wait
was
not
long
suddenly
a
cry
a
groan
the
groan
that
can
come
only
from
a
body
from
which
all
vitality
is
escaping
and
dona
luisa
rushed
in
just
in
time
to
support
her
husband
as
he
was
falling
to
the
floor
the
senator
was
excusing
himself
confusedly
to
the
walls
the
furniture
and
turning
his
back
in
his
agitation
on
the
dismayed
rene
the
only
one
who
could
have
listened
to
him
he
did
not
let
me
finish
he
guessed
from
the
very
first
word
hearing
the
outcry
chichi
hastened
in
in
time
to
see
her
father
slipping
from
his
wife
s
arms
to
the
sofa
and
from
there
to
the
floor
with
glassy
staring
eyes
and
foaming
at
the
mouth
from
the
luxurious
rooms
came
forth
the
cry
always
the
same
from
the
humblest
home
to
the
highest
and
loneliest
oh
julio
oh
my
son
my
son
chapter
v
the
burial
fields
the
automobile
was
going
slowly
forward
under
the
colorless
sky
of
a
winter
morning
in
the
distance
the
earth
s
surface
seemed
trembling
with
white
fluttering
things
resembling
a
band
of
butterflies
poised
on
the
furrows
on
one
of
the
fields
the
swarm
was
of
great
size
on
others
it
was
broken
into
small
groups
as
the
machine
approached
these
white
butterflies
they
seemed
to
be
taking
on
other
colors
one
wing
was
turning
blue
another
they
were
little
flags
by
the
hundreds
by
the
thousands
which
palpitated
night
and
day
in
the
mild
sunny
morning
breeze
in
the
damp
drip
of
the
dull
mornings
in
the
biting
cold
of
the
interminable
nights
the
rains
had
washed
and
them
stealing
away
the
most
of
their
color
some
of
the
borders
of
the
restless
little
strips
were
mildewed
by
the
dampness
while
others
were
scorched
by
the
sun
like
insects
which
have
just
grazed
the
flames
in
the
midst
of
the
fluttering
flags
could
be
seen
the
black
crosses
of
wood
on
these
were
hanging
dark
kepis
red
caps
and
helmets
topped
with
tufts
of
horsehair
slowly
disintegrating
and
weeping
atmospheric
tears
at
every
point
how
many
are
dead
sighed
don
marcelo
s
voice
from
the
automobile
and
rene
who
was
seated
in
front
of
him
sadly
nodded
his
head
dona
luisa
was
looking
at
the
mournful
plain
while
her
lips
trembled
slightly
in
constant
prayer
chichi
turned
her
great
eyes
in
astonishment
from
one
side
to
the
other
she
appeared
larger
more
capable
in
spite
of
the
pallor
which
blanched
her
olive
skin
the
two
ladies
were
dressed
in
deepest
mourning
the
father
too
was
in
mourning
huddled
down
in
the
seat
in
a
crushed
attitude
his
legs
carefully
covered
with
the
great
fur
rugs
rene
was
wearing
his
campaign
uniform
under
his
storm
coat
in
spite
of
his
injuries
he
had
not
wished
to
retire
from
the
army
he
had
been
transferred
to
a
technical
office
till
the
termination
of
the
war
the
desnoyers
family
were
on
the
way
to
carry
out
their
hope
upon
recovering
consciousness
after
the
fatal
news
the
father
had
concentrated
all
his
will
power
in
one
petition
i
must
see
him
oh
my
son
my
son
vain
were
the
senator
s
efforts
to
show
him
the
impossibility
of
such
a
journey
the
fighting
was
still
going
on
in
the
zone
where
julio
had
fallen
later
on
perhaps
it
might
be
possible
to
visit
it
i
want
to
see
it
persisted
the
old
man
it
was
necessary
for
him
to
see
his
son
s
grave
before
dying
himself
and
lacour
had
to
requisition
all
his
powers
for
four
long
months
formulating
requests
and
overcoming
much
opposition
in
order
that
don
marcelo
might
be
permitted
to
make
the
trip
finally
a
military
automobile
came
one
morning
for
the
entire
desnoyers
family
the
senator
could
not
accompany
them
rumors
of
an
approaching
change
in
the
cabinet
were
floating
about
and
he
felt
obliged
to
show
himself
in
the
senate
in
case
the
republic
should
again
wish
to
avail
itself
of
his
unappreciated
services
they
passed
the
night
in
a
provincial
city
where
there
was
a
military
post
and
rene
collected
considerable
information
from
officers
who
had
witnessed
the
great
combat
with
his
map
before
him
he
followed
the
explanations
until
he
thought
he
could
recognize
the
very
plot
of
ground
which
julio
s
regiment
had
occupied
the
following
morning
they
renewed
their
expedition
a
soldier
who
had
taken
part
in
the
battle
acted
as
their
guide
seated
beside
the
chauffeur
from
time
to
time
rene
consulted
the
map
spread
out
on
his
knees
and
asked
questions
of
the
soldier
whose
regiment
had
fought
very
close
to
that
of
desnoyers
but
he
could
not
remember
exactly
the
ground
which
they
had
gone
over
so
many
months
before
the
landscape
had
undergone
many
transformations
and
had
presented
a
very
different
appearance
when
covered
with
men
its
deserted
aspect
bewildered
him
and
the
motor
had
to
go
very
slowly
veering
to
the
north
of
the
line
of
graves
following
the
central
highway
level
and
white
entering
crossroads
and
winding
through
ditches
muddied
with
deep
pools
through
which
they
splashed
with
great
bounds
and
jar
on
the
springs
at
times
they
drove
across
fields
from
one
plot
of
crosses
to
another
their
pneumatic
tires
crushing
flat
from
the
furrows
opened
by
the
plowman
tombs
tombs
on
all
sides
the
white
locusts
of
death
were
swarming
over
the
entire
countryside
there
was
no
corner
free
from
their
quivering
wings
the
recently
plowed
earth
the
yellowing
roads
the
dark
woodland
everything
was
pulsating
in
weariless
undulation
the
soil
seemed
to
be
clamoring
and
its
words
were
the
vibrations
of
the
restless
little
flags
and
the
thousands
of
cries
endlessly
repeated
across
the
days
and
nights
were
intoning
in
rhythmic
chant
the
terrible
onslaught
which
this
earth
had
witnessed
and
from
which
it
still
felt
tragic
shudderings
dead
dead
murmured
chichi
following
the
rows
of
crosses
incessantly
slipping
past
the
sides
of
the
automobile
o
lord
for
them
for
their
mothers
moaned
dona
luisa
renewing
her
prayers
here
had
taken
place
the
fiercest
part
of
the
battle
the
fight
in
the
old
way
man
to
man
outside
of
the
trenches
with
bayonets
with
guns
with
fists
with
teeth
the
guide
who
was
beginning
to
get
his
bearings
was
pointing
out
the
various
points
on
the
desolate
horizon
there
were
the
african
sharpshooters
further
on
the
chasseurs
the
very
large
groups
of
graves
were
where
the
light
infantry
had
charged
with
their
bayonets
on
the
sides
of
the
road
the
automobile
came
to
a
stop
rene
climbed
out
after
the
soldier
in
order
to
examine
the
inscriptions
on
a
few
of
the
crosses
perhaps
these
might
have
belonged
to
the
regiment
they
were
seeking
chichi
also
alighted
mechanically
with
the
irresistible
desire
of
aiding
her
husband
each
grave
contained
several
men
the
number
of
bodies
within
could
be
told
by
the
mouldering
kepis
or
rusting
helmets
hanging
on
the
arms
of
the
cross
the
number
of
the
regiments
could
still
be
deciphered
between
the
rows
of
ants
crawling
over
the
caps
the
wreaths
with
which
affection
had
adorned
some
of
the
sepulchres
were
blackened
and
stripped
of
their
leaves
on
some
of
the
crucifixes
the
names
of
the
dead
were
still
clear
but
others
were
beginning
to
fade
out
and
soon
would
be
entirely
illegible
what
a
horrible
death
what

sadly
not
even
the
names
of
the
greater
part
of
these
vigorous
men
cut
down
in
the
strength
of
their
youth
were
going
to
survive
nothing
would
remain
but
the
memory
which
would
from
time
to
time
overwhelm
some
old
countrywoman
driving
her
cow
along
the
french
highway
murmuring
between
her
sobs
my
little
one
i
wonder
where
they
buried
my
little
one
or
perhaps
it
would
live
in
the
heart
of
the
village
woman
clad
in
mourning
who
did
not
know
how
to
solve
the
problem
of
existence
or
in
the
minds
of
the
children
going
to
school
in
black
blouses
and
saying
with
ferocious
energy
when
i
grow
up
i
am
going
to
kill
the
boches
to
avenge
my
father
s
death
and
dona
luisa
motionless
in
her
seat
followed
with
her
eyes
chichi
s
course
among
the
graves
while
returning
to
her
interrupted
prayer
lord
for
the
mothers
without
sons
for
the
little
ones
without
fathers
may
thy
wrath
not
be
turned
against
us
and
may
thy
smile
shine
upon

once
more
her
husband
shrunken
in
his
seat
was
also
looking
over
the
funereal
fields
but
his
eyes
were
fixed
most
tenaciously
on
some
mounds
without
wreaths
or
flags
simple
crosses
with
a
little
board
bearing
the
briefest
inscription
these
were
the
german
bodies
which
seemed
to
have
a
page
to
themselves
in
the
book
of
death
on
one
side
the
innumerable
french
tombs
with
inscriptions
as
small
as
possible
simple
numbers
one
two
three
dead
on
the
other
in
each
of
the
spacious
unadorned
sepulchres
great
quantities
of
soldiers
with
a
number
of
terrifying
terseness
fences
of
wooden
strips
narrow
and
wide
surrounded
these
latter
ditches
filled
to
the
top
with
bodies
the
earth
was
as
bleached
as
though
covered
with
snow
or
saltpetre
this
was
the
lime
returning
to
mix
with
the
land
the
crosses
raised
above
these
huge
mounds
bore
each
an
inscription
stating
that
it
contained
germans
and
then
a
number
such
appalling
figures
obliged
desnoyers
to
exert
his
imagination
it
was
not
easy
to
evoke
with
exactitude
the
vision
of
three
hundred
carcasses
in
helmets
boots
and
cloaks
in
all
the
revolting
aspects
of
death
piled
in
rows
as
though
they
were
bricks
locked
forever
in
the
depths
of
a
great
trench
and
this
funereal
alignment
was
repeated
at
intervals
all
over
the
great
immensity
of
the
plain
the
mere
sight
of
them
filled
don
marcelo
with
a
kind
of
savage
joy
as
his
mourning
fatherhood
tasted
the
fleeting
consolation
of
vengeance
julio
had
died
and
he
was
going
to
die
too
not
having
strength
to
survive
his
bitter
woe
but
how
many
hundreds
of
the
enemy
wasting
in
these
awful
trenches
were
also
leaving
in
the
world
loved
beings
who
would
remember
them
as
he
was
remembering
his
son
he
imagined
them
as
they
must
have
been
before
the
death
call
sounded
as
he
had
seen
them
in
the
advance
around
his
castle
some
of
them
the
most
prominent
and
terrifying
probably
still
showed
on
their
faces
the
theatrical
cicatrices
of
their
university
duels
they
were
the
soldiers
who
carried
books
in
their
knapsacks
and
after
the
fusillade
of
a
lot
of
country
folk
or
the
sacking
and
burning
of
a
hamlet
devoted
themselves
to
reading
the
poets
and
philosophers
by
the
glare
of
the
blaze
which
they
had
kindled
they
were
bloated
with
science
as
with
the
puffiness
of
a
toad
proud
of
their
pedantic
and
intellectuality
sons
of
sophistry
and
grandsons
of
cant
they
had
considered
themselves
capable
of
proving
the
greatest
absurdities
by
the
mental
capers
to
which
they
had
accustomed
their
acrobatic
intellects
they
had
employed
the
favorite
method
of
the
thesis
antithesis
and
synthesis
in
order
to
demonstrate
that
germany
ought
to
be
the
mistress
of
the
world
that
belgium
was
guilty
of
her
own
ruin
because
she
had
defended
herself
that
true
happiness
consisted
in
having
all
humanity
dominated
by
prussia
that
the
supreme
idea
of
existence
consisted
in
a
clean
stable
and
a
full
manger
that
liberty
and
justice
were
nothing
more
than
illusions
of
the
romanticism
of
the
french
that
every
deed
accomplished
became
virtuous
from
the
moment
it
triumphed
and
that
right
was
simply
a
derivative
of
might
these
metaphysical
athletes
with
guns
and
sabres
were
accustomed
to
consider
themselves
the
paladins
of
a
crusade
of
civilization
they
wished
the
blond
type
to
triumph
definitely
over
the
brunette
they
wished
to
enslave
the
worthless
man
of
the
south
consigning
him
forever
to
a
world
regulated
by
the
salt
of
the
earth
the
aristocracy
of
everything
on
the
page
of
history
that
had
amounted
to
anything
was
german
the
ancient
greeks
had
been
of
germanic
origin
german
too
the
great
artists
of
the
italian
renaissance
the
men
of
the
mediterranean
countries
with
the
inherent
badness
of
their
extraction
had
falsified
history
that
s
the
best
place
for
you
you
are
better
where
you
are
buried
you
pitiless
pedants
thought
desnoyers
recalling
his
conversations
with
his
friend
the
russian
what
a
shame
that
there
were
not
here
too
all
the
herr
professors
of
the
german
universities
those
wise
men
so
unquestionably
skilful
in
altering
the
trademarks
of
intellectual
products
and
changing
the
terminology
of
things
those
men
with
flowing
beards
and
spectacles
pacific
rabbits
of
the
laboratory
and
the
professor
s
chair
that
had
been
preparing
the
ground
for
the
present
war
with
their
sophistries
and
their
unblushing
effrontery
their
guilt
was
far
greater
than
that
of
the
herr
lieutenant
of
the
tight
corset
and
the
gleaming
monocle
who
in
his
thirst
for
strife
and
slaughter
was
simply
and
logically
working
out
the
professional
charts
while
the
german
soldier
of
the
lower
classes
was
plundering
what
he
could
and
drunkenly
shooting
whatever
crossed
his
path
the
warrior
student
was
reading
by
the
camp
glow
hegel
and
nietzsche
he
was
too
enlightened
to
execute
with
his
own
hands
these
acts
of
historical
justice
but
he
with
the
professors
was
rousing
all
the
bad
instincts
of
the
teutonic
beast
and
giving
them
a
varnish
of
scientific
justification
lie
there
in
your
sepulchre
you
intellectual
scourge
continued
desnoyers
mentally
the
fierce
moors
the
negroes
of
infantile
intelligence
the
sullen
hindus
appeared
to
him
more
deserving
of
respect
than
all
the
togas
parading
haughtily
and
aggressively
through
the
cloisters
of
the
german
universities
what
peacefulness
for
the
world
if
their
wearers
should
disappear
forever
he
preferred
the
simple
and
primitive
barbarity
of
the
savage
to
the
refined
deliberate
and
merciless
barbarity
of
the
greedy
sage
it
did
less
harm
and
was
not
so
hypocritical
for
this
reason
the
only
ones
in
the
enemy
s
ranks
who
awakened
his
commiseration
were
the
lowly
and
unlettered
dead
interred
beneath
the
sod
they
had
been
peasants
factory
hands
business
clerks
german
gluttons
of
measureless
intestinal
capacity
who
had
seen
in
the
war
an
opportunity
for
satisfying
their
appetites
for
beating
somebody
and
ordering
them
about
after
having
passed
their
lives
in
their
country
obeying
and
receiving
kicks
the
history
of
their
country
was
nothing
more
than
a
series
of
raids
like
the
indian
forays
in
order
to
plunder
the
property
of
those
who
lived
in
the
mild
mediterranean
climes
the
herr
professors
had
proved
to
their
countrymen
that
such
sacking
incursions
were
indispensable
to
the
highest
civilization
and
that
the
german
was
marching
onward
with
the
enthusiasm
of
a
good
father
sacrificing
himself
in
order
to
secure
bread
for
his
family
hundreds
of
thousands
of
letters
written
by
their
relatives
with
tremulous
hands
were
following
the
great
germanic
horde
across
the
invaded
countries
desnoyers
had
overheard
the
reading
of
some
of
these
at
nightfall
before
his
ruined
castle
these
were
some
of
the
messages
found
in
the
pockets
of
the
imprisoned
or
dead
don
t
show
any
pity
for
the
red
pantaloons
kill
whomever
you
can
and
show
no
mercy
even
to
the
little
we
would
thank
you
for
the

a

our
neighbor
the
captain
has
sent
his
wife
a
necklace
of
pearls
and
you
send
only
such
insignificant
things
the
virtuous
german
had
been
advancing
heroically
with
the
double
desire
of
enlarging
his
country
and
of
making
valuable
gifts
to
his
offspring
deutschland
uber
alles
but
their
most
cherished
illusions
had
fallen
into
the
burial
ditch
in
company
with
thousands
of
fed
on
the
same
dreams
desnoyers
could
imagine
the
impatience
on
the
other
side
of
the
rhine
the
pitiful
women
who
were
waiting
and
waiting
the
lists
of
the
dead
had
perhaps
overlooked
the
missing
ones
and
the
letters
kept
coming
and
coming
to
the
german
lines
many
of
them
never
reaching
their
destination
why
don
t
you
answer
perhaps
you
are
not
writing
so
as
to
give
us
a
great
surprise
don
t
forget
the
necklace
send
us
a
piano
a
carved
china
cabinet
for
the
dining
room
would
please
us
greatly
the
french
have
so
many
beautiful
things
the
bare
cross
rose
stark
and
motionless
above
the
land
near
it
the
little
flags
were
fluttering
their
wings
moving
from
side
to
side
like
a
head
shaking
out
a
smiling
ironical
protest
no
no
the
automobile
continued
on
its
painful
way
the
guide
was
now
pointing
to
a
distant
group
of
graves
that
was
undoubtedly
the
place
where
the
regiment
had
been
fighting
so
the
vehicle
left
the
main
road
sinking
its
wheels
in
the
soft
earth
having
to
make
wide
detours
in
order
to
avoid
the
mounds
scattered
about
so
capriciously
by
the
casualties
of
the
combat
almost
all
of
the
fields
were
ploughed
the
work
of
the
farmer
extended
from
tomb
to
tomb
making
them
more
prominent
as
the
morning
sun
forced
its
way
through
the
enshrouding
mists
nature
blind
unfeeling
and
silent
ignoring
individual
existence
and
taking
to
her
bosom
with
equal
indifference
a
poor
little
animal
or
a
million
corpses
was
beginning
to
smile
under
the
late
winter
suns
the
fountains
were
still
crusted
with
their
beards
of
ice
the
earth
snapped
as
the
feet
weighed
down
its
hidden
crystals
the
trees
black
and
sleeping
were
still
retaining
the
coat
of
metallic
green
in
which
the
winter
had
clothed
them
from
the
depths
of
the
earth
still
issued
an
acute
deadly
chill
like
that
of
planets
but
spring
had
already
girded
herself
with
flowers
in
her
palace
in
the
tropics
and
was
saddling
with
green
her
trusty
steed
neighing
with
impatience
soon
they
would
race
through
the
fields
driving
before
them
in
disordered
flight
the
black
goblins
of
winter
and
leaving
in
their
wake
green
growing
things
and
tender
subtle
perfumes
the
wayside
greenery
robing
itself
in
tiny
buds
was
already
heralding
their
arrival
the
birds
were
venturing
forth
from
their
retreats
in
order
to
wing
their
way
among
the
crows
croaking
wrathfully
above
the
closed
tombs
the
landscape
was
beginning
to
smile
in
the
sunlight
with
the
artless
deceptive
smile
of
a
child
who
looks
candidly
around
while
his
pockets
are
stuffed
with
stolen
goodies
the
husbandmen
had
ploughed
the
fields
and
filled
the
furrows
with
seed
men
might
go
on
killing
each
other
as
much
as
they
liked
the
soil
had
no
concern
with
their
hatreds
and
on
that
account
did
not
propose
to
alter
its
course
as
every
year
the
metal
cutter
had
opened
its
usual
lines
obliterating
with
its
ridges
the
traces
of
man
and
beast
undismayed
and
with
stubborn
diligence
filling
up
the
tunnels
which
the
bombs
had
made
sometimes
the
ploughshare
had
struck
against
an
obstacle
underground
an
unknown
unburied
man
but
the
cultivator
had
continued
on
its
way
without
pity
every
now
and
then
it
was
stopped
by
less
yielding
obstructions
projectiles
which
had
sunk
into
the
ground
intact
the
rustic
had
dug
up
these
instruments
of
death
which
occasionally
had
exploded
their
delayed
charge
in
his
hands
but
the
man
of
the
soil
knows
no
fear
when
in
search
of
sustenance
and
so
was
doggedly
continuing
his
rectilinear
advance
swerving
only
before
the
visible
tombs
there
the
furrows
had
curved
mercifully
making
little
islands
of
the
mounds
surmounted
by
crosses
and
flags
the
seeds
of
future
bread
were
preparing
to
extend
their
tentacles
like
devil
fish
among
those
who
but
a
short
time
before
were
animated
by
such
monstrous
ambition
life
was
about
to
renew
itself
once
more
the
automobile
came
to
a
standstill
the
guide
was
running
about
among
the
crosses
stooping
over
in
order
to
examine
their
inscriptions
here
we
are
he
had
found
above
one
grave
the
number
of
the
regiment
chichi
and
her
husband
promptly
dismounted
again
then
dona
luisa
with
sad
resolution
biting
her
lips
to
keep
the
tears
back
then
the
three
devoted
themselves
to
assisting
the
father
who
had
thrown
off
his
fur
poor
desnoyers
on
touching
the
ground
he
swayed
back
and
forth
moving
forward
with
the
greatest
effort
lifting
his
feet
with
difficulty
and
sinking
his
staff
in
the
hollows
lean
on
me
my
poor
dear
said
the
old
wife
offering
her
arm
the
masterful
head
of
the
family
could
no
longer
take
a
single
step
without
their
aid
then
began
their
slow
painful
pilgrimage
among
the
graves
the
guide
was
still
exploring
the
spot
bristling
with
crosses
spelling
out
the
names
and
hesitating
before
the
faded
lettering
rene
was
doing
the
same
on
the
other
side
of
the
road
chichi
went
on
alone
the
wind
whirling
her
black
veil
around
her
and
making
the
little
curls
escape
from
under
her
mourning
hat
every
time
she
leaned
over
to
decipher
a
name
her
daintily
shod
feet
sunk
deep
into
the
ruts
and
she
had
to
gather
her
skirts
about
her
in
order
to
move
more
comfortably
revealing
thus
at
every
step
evidences
of
the
joy
of
living
of
hidden
beauty
of
consummated
love
following
her
course
through
this
land
of
death
and
desolation
in
the
distance
sounded
feebly
her
father
s
voice
not
yet
the
two
elders
were
growing
impatient
anxious
to
find
their
son
s
resting
place
as
soon
as
possible
a
half
hour
thus
dragged
by
without
any
result
always
unfamiliar
names
anonymous
crosses
or
the
numbers
of
other
regiments
don
marcelo
was
no
longer
able
to
stand
their
passage
across
the
irregularities
of
the
soft
earth
had
been
torment
for
him
he
was
beginning
to
despair
ay
they
would
never
find
julio
s
remains
the
parents
too
had
been
scrutinizing
the
plots
nearest
them
bending
sadly
before
cross
after
cross
they
stopped
before
a
long
narrow
hillock
and
read
the
name
no
he
was
not
there
either
and
they
continued
desperately
along
the
painful
path
of
alternate
hopes
and
disappointments
it
was
chichi
who
notified
them
with
a
cry
here
here
it
is
the
old
folks
tried
to
run
almost
falling
at
every
step
all
the
family
were
soon
grouped
around
a
heap
of
earth
in
the
vague
outline
of
a
bier
and
beginning
to
be
covered
with
herbage
at
the
head
was
a
cross
with
letters
cut
in
deep
with
the
point
of
a
knife
the
kind
deed
of
some
of
his
then
in
military
abbreviations
the
rank
regiment
and
company
a
long
silence
dona
luisa
had
knelt
instantly
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
cross
those
great
bloodshot
eyes
that
could
no
longer
weep
till
then
tears
had
been
constantly
in
her
eyes
but
now
they
deserted
her
as
though
overcome
by
the
immensity
of
a
grief
incapable
of
expressing
itself
in
the
usual
ways
the
father
was
staring
at
the
rustic
grave
in
dumb
amazement
his
son
was
there
there
forever
and
he
would
never
see
him
again
he
imagined
him
sleeping
unshrouded
below
in
direct
contact
with
the
earth
just
as
death
had
surprised
him
in
his
miserable
and
heroic
old
uniform
he
recalled
the
exquisite
care
which
the
lad
had
always
given
his
body
the
long
bath
the
massage
the
invigorating
exercise
of
boxing
and
fencing
the
cold
shower
the
elegant
and
subtle
perfume
all
that
he
might
come
to
this
that
he
might
be
interred
just
where
he
had
fallen
in
his
tracks
like
a
wornout
beast
of
burden
the
bereaved
father
wished
to
transfer
his
son
immediately
from
the
official
burial
fields
but
he
could
not
do
it
yet
as
soon
as
possible
it
should
be
done
and
he
would
erect
for
him
a
mausoleum
fit
for
a
king
and
what
good
would
that
do
he
would
merely
be
changing
the
location
of
a
mass
of
bones
but
his
body
his
physical
semblance
all
that
had
contributed
to
the
charm
of
his
personality
would
be
mixed
with
the
earth
the
son
of
the
rich
desnoyers
would
have
become
an
inseparable
part
of
a
poor
field
in
champagne
ah
the
pity
of
it
all
and
for
this
had
he
worked
so
hard
and
so
long
to
accumulate
his
millions
he
could
never
know
how
julio
s
death
had
happened
nobody
could
tell
him
his
last
words
he
was
ignorant
as
to
whether
his
end
had
been
instantaneous
overwhelming
his
idol
going
out
of
the
world
with
his
usual
gay
smile
on
his
lips
or
whether
he
had
endured
long
hours
of
agony
abandoned
in
the
field
writhing
like
a
reptile
or
passing
through
phases
of
hellish
torment
before
collapsing
in
merciful
oblivion
he
was
also
ignorant
of
just
how
much
was
beneath
this
mound
whether
an
entire
body
discreetly
touched
by
the
hand
of
death
or
an
assemblage
of
shapeless
remnants
from
the
devastating
hurricane
of
steel
and
he
would
never
see
him
again
and
that
julio
who
had
been
filling
his
thoughts
would
become
simply
a
memory
a
name
that
would
live
while
his
parents
lived
fading
away
little
by
little
after
they
had
disappeared
he
was
startled
to
hear
a
moan
a
sob
then
he
recognized
dully
that
they
were
his
own
that
he
had
been
accompanying
his
reflections
with
groans
of
grief
his
wife
was
still
at
his
feet
kneeling
alone
with
her
heartbreak
fixing
her
dry
eyes
on
the
cross
with
a
gaze
of
hypnotic
tenacity
there
was
her
son
near
her
knees
lying
stretched
out
as
she
had
so
often
watched
him
when
sleeping
in
his
cradle
the
father
s
sobs
were
wringing
her
heart
too
but
with
an
unbearable
depression
without
his
wrathful
exasperation
and
she
would
never
see
him
again
could
it
be
possible
chichi
s
presence
interrupted
the
despairing
thoughts
of
her
parents
she
had
run
to
the
automobile
and
was
returning
with
an
armful
of
flowers
she
hung
a
wreath
on
the
cross
and
placed
a
great
spray
of
blossoms
at
the
foot
then
she
scattered
a
shower
of
petals
over
the
entire
surface
of
the
grave
sadly
intensely
as
though
performing
a
religious
rite
accompanying
the
offering
with
her
outspoken
thoughts
for
you
who
so
loved
life
for
its
beauties
and
pleasures
for
you
who
knew
so
well
how
to
make
yourself
beloved
and
as
her
tears
fell
her
affectionate
memories
were
as
full
of
admiration
as
of
grief
had
she
not
been
his
sister
she
would
have
liked
to
have
been
his
beloved
and
having
exhausted
the
rain
of
she
wandered
away
so
as
not
to
disturb
the
lamentations
of
her
parents
before
the
uselessness
of
his
bitter
plaints
don
marcelo
s
former
dominant
character
had
come
to
life
raging
against
destiny
he
looked
at
the
horizon
where
so
often
he
had
imagined
the
adversary
to
be
and
clenched
his
fists
in
a
paroxysm
of
fury
his
disordered
mind
believed
that
it
saw
the
beast
the
nemesis
of
humanity
and
how
much
longer
would
the
evil
be
allowed
to
go
unpunished
there
was
no
justice
the
world
was
ruled
by
blind
chance
all
lies
mere
words
of
consolation
in
order
that
mankind
might
exist
unterrified
by
the
hopeless
abandon
in
which
it
lived
it
appeared
to
him
that
from
afar
was
echoing
the
gallop
of
the
four
apocalyptic
horsemen
riding
over
all
his
he
saw
the
strong
and
brutal
giant
with
the
sword
of
war
the
archer
with
his
repulsive
smile
shooting
his
pestilential
arrows
the
miser
with
the
scales
of
famine
the
spectre
with
the
scythe
of
death
he
recognized
them
as
only
divinities
familiar
and
had
made
their
presence
felt
by
mankind
all
the
rest
was
a
dream
the
four
horsemen
were
the
reality
suddenly
by
the
mysterious
process
of
telepathy
he
seemed
to
read
the
thoughts
of
the
one
grieving
at
his
feet
the
mother
impelled
by
her
own
sorrow
was
thinking
of
that
of
others
she
too
was
looking
toward
the
distant
horizon
there
she
seemed
to
see
a
procession
of
the
enemy
grieving
in
the
same
way
as
were
her
family
she
saw
elena
with
her
daughters
going
in
and
out
among
the
burial
grounds
seeking
a
loved
one
falling
on
their
knees
before
a
cross
ay
this
mournful
satisfaction
she
could
never
know
completely
it
would
be
forever
impossible
for
her
to
pass
to
the
opposite
side
in
search
of
the
other
grave
for
even
after
some
time
had
passed
by
she
could
never
find
it
the
beloved
body
of
otto
would
have
disappeared
forever
in
one
of
the
nameless
pits
which
they
had
just
passed
o
lord
why
did
we
ever
come
to
these
lands
why
did
we
not
continue
living
in
the
land
where
we
were
born
desnoyers
too
uniting
his
thoughts
with
hers
was
seeing
again
the
pampas
the
immense
green
plains
of
the
ranch
where
he
had
become
acquainted
with
his
wife
again
he
could
hear
the
tread
of
the
herds
he
recalled
madariaga
on
tranquil
nights
proclaiming
under
the
splendor
of
the
stars
the
joys
of
peace
the
sacred
brotherhood
of
these
people
of
most
diverse
extraction
united
by
labor
abundance
and
the
lack
of
political
ambition
and
as
his
thoughts
swung
back
to
the
lost
son
he
too
exclaimed
with
his
wife
oh
why
did
we
ever
come
he
too
with
the
solidarity
of
grief
began
to
sympathize
with
those
on
the
other
side
of
the
battle
front
they
were
suffering
just
as
he
was
they
had
lost
their
sons
human
grief
is
the
same
everywhere
but
then
he
revolted
against
his
commiseration
karl
had
been
an
advocate
of
this
war
he
was
among
those
who
had
looked
upon
war
as
the
perfect
state
for
mankind
who
had
prepared
it
with
their
provocations
it
was
just
that
war
should
devour
his
sons
he
ought
not
to
bewail
their
loss
but
he
who
had
always
loved
peace
he
who
had
only
one
son
only
one
and
now
he
was
losing
him
forever
he
was
going
to
die
he
was
sure
that
he
was
going
to
die
only
a
few
months
of
life
were
left
in
him
and
his
pitiful
devoted
companion
kneeling
at
his
feet
she
too
would
soon
pass
away
she
could
not
long
survive
the
blow
which
they
had
just
received
there
was
nothing
further
for
them
to
do
nobody
needed
them
any
longer
their
daughter
was
thinking
only
of
herself
of
founding
a
separate
home
interest
with
the
hard
instinct
of
independence
which
separates
children
from
their
parents
in
order
that
humanity
may
continue
its
work
of
renovation
julio
was
the
only
one
who
would
have
prolonged
the
family
passing
on
the
name
the
desnoyers
had
died
his
daughter
s
children
would
be
lacour
all
was
ended
don
marcelo
even
felt
a
certain
satisfaction
in
thinking
of
his
approaching
death
more
than
anything
else
he
wished
to
pass
out
of
the
world
he
no
longer
had
any
curiosity
as
to
the
end
of
this
war
in
which
he
had
been
so
interested
whatever
the
end
might
be
it
would
be
sure
to
turn
out
badly
although
the
beast
might
be
mutilated
it
would
again
come
forth
years
afterward
as
the
eternal
curse
of
mankind
for
him
the
only
important
thing
now
was
that
the
war
had
robbed
him
of
his
son
all
was
gloomy
all
was
black
the
world
was
going
to
its
ruin
he
was
going
to
rest
chichi
had
clambered
up
on
the
hillock
which
contained
perhaps
more
than
their
dead
with
furrowed
brow
she
was
contemplating
the
plain
graves
graves
everywhere
the
recollection
of
julio
had
already
passed
to
second
place
in
her
mind
she
could
not
bring
him
back
no
matter
how
much
she
might
weep
this
vision
of
the
fields
of
death
made
her
think
all
the
more
of
the
living
as
her
eyes
roved
from
side
to
side
she
tried
with
her
hands
to
keep
down
the
whirling
of
her
skirts
rene
was
standing
at
the
foot
of
the
knoll
and
several
times
after
a
sweeping
glance
at
the
numberless
mounds
around
them
she
looked
thoughtfully
at
him
as
though
trying
to
establish
a
relationship
between
her
husband
and
those
below
and
he
had
exposed
his
life
in
combats
just
as
these
men
had
done
and
you
my
poor
darling
she
continued
aloud
at
this
very
moment
you
too
might
be
lying
here
under
a
heap
of
earth
with
a
wooden
cross
at
your
head
just
like
these
poor
unfortunates
the
smiled
sadly
yes
it
was
so
come
here
climb
up
here
said
chichi
impetuously
i
want
to
give
you
something
as
soon
as
he
approached
her
she
flung
her
arms
around
his
neck
pressed
him
against
the
warm
softness
of
her
breast
exhaling
a
perfume
of
life
and
love
and
kissed
him
passionately
without
a
thought
of
her
brother
without
seeing
her
aged
parents
grieving
below
them
and
longing
to
die
and
her
skirts
freed
by
the
breeze
molded
her
figure
in
the
superb
sweep
of
the
curves
of
a
grecian
vase
