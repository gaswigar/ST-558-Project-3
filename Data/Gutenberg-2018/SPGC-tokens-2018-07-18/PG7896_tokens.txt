note
these
adventures
were
told
to
me
in
the
old
days
by
arsène
lupin
as
though
they
had
happened
to
a
friend
of
his
named
prince
rénine
as
for
me
considering
the
way
in
which
they
were
conducted
the
actions
the
behaviour
and
the
very
character
of
the
hero
i
find
it
very
difficult
not
to
identify
the
two
friends
as
one
and
the
same
person
arsène
lupin
is
gifted
with
a
powerful
imagination
and
is
quite
capable
of
attributing
to
himself
adventures
which
are
not
his
at
all
and
of
disowning
those
which
are
really
his
the
reader
will

hortense
daniel
pushed
her
window
ajar
and
whispered
are
you
there
rossigny
i
am
here
replied
a
voice
from
the
shrubbery
at
the
front
of
the
house
leaning
forward
she
saw
a
rather
fat
man
looking
up
at
her
out
of
a
gross
red
face
with
its
cheeks
and
chin
set
in
unpleasantly
fair
whiskers
well
he
asked
well
i
had
a
great
argument
with
my
uncle
and
aunt
last
night
they
absolutely
refuse
to
sign
the
document
of
which
my
lawyer
sent
them
the
draft
or
to
restore
the
dowry
squandered
by
my
husband
but
your
uncle
is
responsible
by
the
terms
of
the
no
matter
he
refuses
well
what
do
you
propose
to
do
are
you
still
determined
to
run
away
with
me
she
asked
with
a
laugh
more
so
than
ever
your
intentions
are
strictly
honourable
remember
just
as
you
please
you
know
that
i
am
madly
in
love
with
you
unfortunately
i
am
not
madly
in
love
with
you
then
what
made
you
choose
me
chance
i
was
bored
i
was
growing
tired
of
my
humdrum
existence
so
ready
to
run
risks
here
my
luggage
catch
she
let
down
from
the
window
a
couple
of
large
leather
rossigny
caught
them
in
his
arms
the
die
is
cast
she
whispered
go
and
wait
for
me
with
your
car
at
the
if
i
shall
come
on
horseback
hang
it
i
ca
run
off
with
your
horse
he
will
go
home
by
himself
capital
oh
by
the
way
what
is
it
who
is
this
prince
rénine
who
been
here
the
last
three
days
and
whom
nobody
seems
to
know
i
do
know
much
about
him
my
uncle
met
him
at
a
friend
shoot
and
asked
him
here
to
stay
you
seem
to
have
made
a
great
impression
on
him
you
went
for
a
long
ride
with
him
yesterday
he
a
man
i
do
care
for
in
two
hours
i
shall
have
left
the
house
in
your
company
the
scandal
will
cool
him
off
well
we
talked
long
enough
we
have
no
time
to
lose
for
a
few
minutes
she
stood
watching
the
fat
man
bending
under
the
weight
of
her
traps
as
he
moved
away
in
the
shelter
of
an
empty
avenue
then
she
closed
the
window
outside
in
the
park
the
huntsmen
horns
were
sounding
the
reveille
the
hounds
burst
into
frantic
baying
it
was
the
opening
day
of
the
hunt
that
morning
at
the
château
de
la
marèze
where
every
year
in
the
first
week
in
september
the
comte
a
mighty
hunter
before
the
lord
and
his
countess
were
accustomed
to
invite
a
few
personal
friends
and
the
neighbouring
landowners
hortense
slowly
finished
dressing
put
on
a
which
revealed
the
lines
of
her
supple
figure
and
a
felt
hat
which
encircled
her
lovely
face
and
auburn
hair
and
sat
down
to
her
at
which
she
wrote
to
her
uncle
a
farewell
letter
to
be
delivered
to
him
that
evening
it
was
a
difficult
letter
to
word
and
after
beginning
it
several
times
she
ended
by
giving
up
the
idea
i
will
write
to
him
later
she
said
to
herself
when
his
anger
has
cooled
down
and
she
went
downstairs
to
the
enormous
logs
were
blazing
in
the
hearth
of
the
lofty
room
the
walls
were
hung
with
trophies
of
rifles
and
shotguns
the
guests
were
flocking
in
from
every
side
shaking
hands
with
the
comte
one
of
those
typical
country
squires
heavily
and
powerfully
built
who
lives
only
for
hunting
and
shooting
he
was
standing
before
the
fire
with
a
large
glass
of
old
brandy
in
his
hand
drinking
the
health
of
each
new
arrival
hortense
kissed
him
absently
what
uncle
you
who
are
usually
so
sober
pooh
he
said
a
man
may
surely
indulge
himself
a
little
once
a
year
aunt
will
give
you
a
scolding
your
aunt
has
one
of
her
sick
headaches
and
is
not
coming
down
besides
he
added
gruffly
it
is
not
her
business
and
still
less
is
it
yours
my
dear
child
prince
rénine
came
up
to
hortense
he
was
a
young
man
very
smartly
dressed
with
a
narrow
and
rather
pale
face
whose
eyes
held
by
turns
the
gentlest
and
the
harshest
the
most
friendly
and
the
most
satirical
expression
he
bowed
to
her
kissed
her
hand
and
said
may
i
remind
you
of
your
kind
promise
dear
madame
my
promise
yes
we
agreed
that
we
should
repeat
our
delightful
excursion
of
yesterday
and
try
to
go
over
that
old
place
the
look
of
which
made
us
so
curious
it
seems
to
be
known
as
the
domaine
de
halingre
she
answered
a
little
curtly
i
extremely
sorry
monsieur
but
it
would
be
rather
far
and
i
feeling
a
little
done
up
i
shall
go
for
a
canter
in
the
park
and
come
indoors
again
there
was
a
pause
then
serge
rénine
said
smiling
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
hers
and
in
a
voice
which
she
alone
could
hear
i
am
sure
that
you
keep
your
promise
and
that
you
let
me
come
with
you
it
would
be
better
for
whom
for
you
you
mean
for
you
too
i
assure
you
she
coloured
slightly
but
did
not
reply
shook
hands
with
a
few
people
around
her
and
left
the
room
a
groom
was
holding
the
horse
at
the
foot
of
the
steps
she
mounted
and
set
off
towards
the
woods
beyond
the
park
it
was
a
cool
still
morning
through
the
leaves
which
barely
quivered
the
sky
showed
crystalline
blue
hortense
rode
at
a
walk
down
winding
avenues
which
in
half
an
hour
brought
her
to
a
of
ravines
and
bluffs
intersected
by
the
she
stopped
there
was
not
a
sound
rossigny
must
have
stopped
his
engine
and
concealed
the
car
in
the
thickets
around
the
if
she
was
five
hundred
yards
at
most
from
that
circular
space
after
hesitating
for
a
few
seconds
she
dismounted
tied
her
horse
carelessly
so
that
he
could
release
himself
by
the
least
effort
and
return
to
the
house
shrouded
her
face
in
the
long
brown
veil
that
hung
over
her
shoulders
and
walked
on
as
she
expected
she
saw
rossigny
directly
she
reached
the
first
turn
in
the
road
he
ran
up
to
her
and
drew
her
into
the
coppice
quick
quick
oh
i
was
so
afraid
that
you
would
be
late
or
even
change
your
mind
and
here
you
are
it
seems
too
good
to
be
true
she
smiled
you
appear
to
be
quite
happy
to
do
an
idiotic
thing
i
should
think
i
happy
and
so
will
you
be
i
swear
you
will
your
life
will
be
one
long
you
shall
have
every
luxury
and
all
the
money
you
can
wish
for
i
want
neither
money
nor
luxuries
what
then
happiness
you
can
safely
leave
your
happiness
to
me
she
replied
jestingly
i
rather
doubt
the
quality
of
the
happiness
which
you
would
give
me
wait
you
see
you
see
they
had
reached
the
motor
rossigny
still
stammering
expressions
of
delight
started
the
engine
hortense
stepped
in
and
wrapped
herself
in
a
wide
cloak
the
car
followed
the
narrow
grassy
path
which
led
back
to
the
and
rossigny
was
accelerating
the
speed
when
he
was
suddenly
forced
to
pull
up
a
shot
had
rung
out
from
the
neighbouring
wood
on
the
right
the
car
was
swerving
from
side
to
side
a
front
tire
burst
shouted
rossigny
leaping
to
the
ground
not
a
bit
of
it
cried
hortense
somebody
fired
impossible
my
dear
do
be
so
absurd
at
that
moment
two
slight
shocks
were
felt
and
two
more
reports
were
heard
one
after
the
other
some
way
off
and
still
in
the
wood
rossigny
snarled
the
back
tires
burst
now
both
of
them
but
who
in
the
name
can
the
ruffian
be
just
let
me
get
hold
of
him
that
all
he
clambered
up
the
slope
there
was
no
one
there
moreover
the
leaves
of
the
coppice
blocked
the
view
damn
it
damn
it
he
swore
you
were
right
somebody
was
firing
at
the
car
oh
this
is
a
bit
thick
we
shall
be
held
up
for
hours
three
tires
to
mend
but
what
are
you
doing
dear
girl
hortense
herself
had
alighted
from
the
car
she
ran
to
him
greatly
excited
i
going
but
why
i
want
to
know
some
one
fired
i
want
to
know
who
it
was
do
let
us
separate
please
do
you
think
i
going
to
wait
here
for
you
for
hours
what
about
your
running
away
all
our
plans
we
discuss
that
go
back
to
the
house
take
back
my
things
with
you
and
for
the
present
she
hurried
left
him
had
the
good
luck
to
find
her
horse
and
set
off
at
a
gallop
in
a
direction
leading
away
from
la
marèze
there
was
not
the
least
doubt
in
her
mind
that
the
three
shots
had
been
fired
by
prince
rénine
it
was
he
she
muttered
angrily
it
was
he
no
one
else
would
be
capable
of
such
behaviour
besides
he
had
warned
her
in
his
smiling
masterful
way
that
he
would
expect
her
she
was
weeping
with
rage
and
humiliation
at
that
moment
had
she
found
herself
face
to
face
with
prince
rénine
she
could
have
struck
him
with
her
before
her
was
the
rugged
and
picturesque
stretch
of
country
which
lies
between
the
orne
and
the
sarthe
above
alençon
and
which
is
known
as
little
switzerland
steep
hills
compelled
her
frequently
to
moderate
her
pace
the
more
so
as
she
had
to
cover
some
six
miles
before
reaching
her
destination
but
though
the
speed
at
which
she
rode
became
less
headlong
though
her
physical
effort
gradually
slackened
she
nevertheless
persisted
in
her
indignation
against
prince
rénine
she
bore
him
a
grudge
not
only
for
the
unspeakable
action
of
which
he
had
been
guilty
but
also
for
his
behaviour
to
her
during
the
last
three
days
his
persistent
attentions
his
assurance
his
air
of
excessive
politeness
she
was
nearly
there
in
the
bottom
of
a
valley
an
old
full
of
cracks
and
covered
with
moss
and
weeds
revealed
the
of
a
château
and
a
few
windows
with
closed
shutters
this
was
the
domaine
de
halingre
she
followed
the
wall
and
turned
a
corner
in
the
middle
of
the
space
before
which
lay
the
serge
rénine
stood
waiting
beside
his
horse
she
sprang
to
the
ground
and
as
he
stepped
forward
hat
in
hand
thanking
her
for
coming
she
cried
one
word
monsieur
to
begin
with
something
quite
inexplicable
happened
just
now
three
shots
were
fired
at
a
in
which
i
was
sitting
did
you
fire
those
shots
yes
she
seemed
dumbfounded
then
you
confess
it
you
have
asked
a
question
madame
and
i
have
answered
it
but
how
dared
you
what
gave
you
the
right
i
was
not
exercising
a
right
madame
i
was
performing
a
duty
indeed
and
what
duty
pray
the
duty
of
protecting
you
against
a
man
who
is
trying
to
profit
by
your
troubles
i
forbid
you
to
speak
like
that
i
am
responsible
for
my
own
actions
and
i
decided
upon
them
in
perfect
liberty
madame
i
overheard
your
conversation
with
rossigny
this
morning
and
it
did
not
appear
to
me
that
you
were
accompanying
him
with
a
light
heart
i
admit
the
ruthlessness
and
bad
taste
of
my
interference
and
i
apologise
for
it
humbly
but
i
risked
being
taken
for
a
ruffian
in
order
to
give
you
a
few
hours
for
reflection
i
have
reflected
fully
monsieur
when
i
have
once
made
up
my
mind
to
a
thing
i
do
not
change
it
yes
madame
you
do
sometimes
if
not
why
are
you
here
instead
of
there
hortense
was
confused
for
a
moment
all
her
anger
had
subsided
she
looked
at
rénine
with
the
surprise
which
one
experiences
when
confronted
with
certain
persons
who
are
unlike
their
fellows
more
capable
of
performing
unusual
actions
more
generous
and
disinterested
she
realised
perfectly
that
he
was
acting
without
any
ulterior
motive
or
calculation
that
he
was
as
he
had
said
merely
fulfilling
his
duty
as
a
gentleman
to
a
woman
who
has
taken
the
wrong
turning
speaking
very
gently
he
said
i
know
very
little
about
you
madame
but
enough
to
make
me
wish
to
be
of
use
to
you
you
are
years
old
and
have
lost
both
your
parents
seven
years
ago
you
became
the
wife
of
the
comte
nephew
by
marriage
who
proved
to
be
of
unsound
mind
half
insane
indeed
and
had
to
be
confined
this
made
it
impossible
for
you
to
obtain
a
divorce
and
compelled
you
since
your
dowry
had
been
squandered
to
live
with
your
uncle
and
at
his
expense
it
a
depressing
environment
the
count
and
countess
do
not
agree
years
ago
the
count
was
deserted
by
his
first
wife
who
ran
away
with
the
countess
first
husband
the
abandoned
husband
and
wife
decided
out
of
spite
to
unite
their
fortunes
but
found
nothing
but
disappointment
and
in
this
second
marriage
and
you
suffer
the
consequences
they
lead
a
monotonous
narrow
lonely
life
for
eleven
months
or
more
out
of
the
year
one
day
you
met
rossigny
who
fell
in
love
with
you
and
suggested
an
elopement
you
did
not
care
for
him
but
you
were
bored
your
youth
was
being
wasted
you
longed
for
the
unexpected
for
adventure
in
a
word
you
accepted
with
the
very
definite
intention
of
keeping
your
admirer
at
arm
length
but
also
with
the
rather
ingenuous
hope
that
the
scandal
would
force
your
uncle
hand
and
make
him
account
for
his
trusteeship
and
assure
you
of
an
independent
existence
that
is
how
you
stand
at
present
you
have
to
choose
between
placing
yourself
in
rossigny
hands
or
trusting
yourself
to
me
she
raised
her
eyes
to
his
what
did
he
mean
what
was
the
purport
of
this
offer
which
he
made
so
seriously
like
a
friend
who
asks
nothing
but
to
prove
his
devotion
after
a
moment
silence
he
took
the
two
horses
by
the
bridle
and
tied
them
up
then
he
examined
the
heavy
gates
each
of
which
was
strengthened
by
two
planks
nailed
an
electoral
poster
dated
twenty
years
earlier
showed
that
no
one
had
entered
the
domain
since
that
time
rénine
tore
up
one
of
the
iron
posts
which
supported
a
railing
that
ran
round
the
crescent
and
used
it
as
a
lever
the
rotten
planks
gave
way
one
of
them
uncovered
the
lock
which
he
attacked
with
a
big
knife
containing
a
number
of
blades
and
implements
a
minute
later
the
gate
opened
on
a
waste
of
bracken
which
led
up
to
a
long
dilapidated
building
with
a
turret
at
each
corner
and
a
sort
of
a
belvedere
built
on
a
taller
tower
in
the
middle
the
prince
turned
to
hortense
you
are
in
no
hurry
he
said
you
will
form
your
decision
this
evening
and
if
rossigny
succeeds
in
persuading
you
for
the
second
time
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
i
shall
not
cross
your
path
until
then
grant
me
the
privilege
of
your
company
we
made
up
our
minds
yesterday
to
inspect
the
château
let
us
do
so
will
you
it
is
as
good
a
way
as
any
of
passing
the
time
and
i
have
a
notion
that
it
will
not
be
uninteresting
he
had
a
way
of
talking
which
compelled
obedience
he
seemed
to
be
commanding
and
entreating
at
the
same
time
hortense
did
not
even
seek
to
shake
off
the
enervation
into
which
her
will
was
slowly
sinking
she
followed
him
to
a
flight
of
steps
at
the
top
of
which
was
a
door
likewise
strengthened
by
planks
nailed
in
the
form
of
a
cross
rénine
went
to
work
in
the
same
way
as
before
they
entered
a
spacious
hall
paved
with
white
and
black
flagstones
furnished
with
old
sideboards
and
and
adorned
with
a
carved
escutcheon
which
displayed
the
remains
of
armorial
bearings
representing
an
eagle
standing
on
a
block
of
stone
all
behind
a
veil
of
cobwebs
which
hung
down
over
a
pair
of
the
door
of
the
evidently
said
rénine
he
found
this
more
difficult
to
open
and
it
was
only
by
repeatedly
charging
it
with
his
shoulder
that
he
was
able
to
move
one
of
the
doors
hortense
had
not
spoken
a
word
she
watched
not
without
surprise
this
series
of
forcible
entries
which
were
accomplished
with
a
really
masterly
skill
he
guessed
her
thoughts
and
turning
round
said
in
a
serious
voice
it
to
me
i
was
a
locksmith
once
she
seized
his
arm
and
whispered
listen
to
what
he
asked
she
increased
the
pressure
of
her
hand
to
demand
silence
the
next
moment
he
murmured
it
really
very
strange
listen
listen
hortense
repeated
in
bewilderment
can
it
be
possible
they
heard
not
far
from
where
they
were
standing
a
sharp
sound
the
sound
of
a
light
tap
recurring
at
regular
intervals
and
they
had
only
to
listen
attentively
to
recognise
the
ticking
of
a
clock
yes
it
was
this
and
nothing
else
that
broke
the
profound
silence
of
the
dark
room
it
was
indeed
the
deliberate
ticking
rhythmical
as
the
beat
of
a
metronome
produced
by
a
heavy
brass
pendulum
that
was
it
and
nothing
could
be
more
impressive
than
the
measured
pulsation
of
this
trivial
mechanism
which
by
some
miracle
some
inexplicable
phenomenon
had
continued
to
live
in
the
heart
of
the
dead
château
and
yet
stammered
hortense
without
daring
to
raise
her
voice
no
one
has
entered
the
house
no
one
and
it
is
quite
impossible
for
that
clock
to
have
kept
going
for
twenty
years
without
being
wound
up
quite
impossible
then
serge
rénine
opened
the
three
windows
and
threw
back
the
shutters
he
and
hortense
were
in
a
as
he
had
thought
and
the
room
showed
not
the
least
sign
of
disorder
the
chairs
were
in
their
places
not
a
piece
of
furniture
was
missing
the
people
who
had
lived
there
and
who
had
made
it
the
most
individual
room
in
their
house
had
gone
away
leaving
everything
just
as
it
was
the
books
which
they
used
to
read
the
on
the
tables
and
consoles
rénine
examined
the
old
grandfather
clock
contained
in
its
tall
carved
case
which
showed
the
disk
of
the
pendulum
through
an
oval
pane
of
glass
he
opened
the
door
of
the
clock
the
weights
hanging
from
the
cords
were
at
their
lowest
point
at
that
moment
there
was
a
click
the
clock
struck
eight
with
a
serious
note
which
hortense
was
never
to
forget
how
extraordinary
she
said
extraordinary
indeed
said
he
for
the
works
are
exceedingly
simple
and
would
hardly
keep
going
for
a
week
and
do
you
see
nothing
out
of
the
common
no
nothing
or
at
least
he
stooped
and
from
the
back
of
the
case
drew
a
metal
tube
which
was
concealed
by
the
weights
holding
it
up
to
the
light
a
telescope
he
said
thoughtfully
why
did
they
hide
it
and
they
left
it
drawn
out
to
its
full
length
that
odd
what
does
it
mean
the
clock
as
is
sometimes
usual
began
to
strike
a
second
time
sounding
eight
strokes
rénine
closed
the
case
and
continued
his
inspection
without
putting
his
telescope
down
a
wide
arch
led
from
the
to
a
smaller
apartment
a
sort
of
this
also
was
furnished
but
contained
a
glass
case
for
guns
of
which
the
rack
was
empty
hanging
on
a
panel
near
by
was
a
calendar
with
the
date
of
the
of
september
oh
cried
hortense
in
astonishment
the
same
date
as
they
tore
off
the
leaves
until
the
of
september
and
this
is
the
anniversary
what
an
astonishing
coincidence
astonishing
he
echoed
it
the
anniversary
of
their
departure
twenty
years
ago
you
must
admit
she
said
that
all
this
is
incomprehensible
yes
of
course
but
all
the
same
perhaps
not
have
you
any
idea
he
waited
a
few
seconds
before
replying
what
puzzles
me
is
this
telescope
hidden
dropped
in
that
corner
at
the
last
moment
i
wonder
what
it
was
used
for
from
the
windows
you
see
nothing
but
the
trees
in
the
garden
and
the
same
i
expect
from
all
the
windows
we
are
in
a
valley
without
the
least
open
horizon
to
use
the
telescope
one
would
have
to
go
up
to
the
top
of
the
house
shall
we
go
up
she
did
not
hesitate
the
mystery
surrounding
the
whole
adventure
excited
her
curiosity
so
keenly
that
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
accompanying
rénine
and
assisting
him
in
his
investigations
they
went
upstairs
accordingly
and
on
the
second
floor
came
to
a
landing
where
they
found
the
spiral
staircase
leading
to
the
belvedere
at
the
top
of
this
was
a
platform
in
the
open
air
but
surrounded
by
a
parapet
over
six
feet
high
there
must
have
been
battlements
which
have
been
filled
in
since
observed
prince
rénine
look
here
there
were
at
one
time
they
may
have
been
blocked
in
any
case
she
said
the
telescope
was
of
no
use
up
here
either
and
we
may
as
well
go
down
again
i
do
agree
he
said
logic
tells
us
that
there
must
have
been
some
gap
through
which
the
country
could
be
seen
and
this
was
the
spot
where
the
telescope
was
used
he
hoisted
himself
by
his
wrists
to
the
top
of
the
parapet
and
then
saw
that
this
point
of
vantage
commanded
the
whole
of
the
valley
including
the
park
with
its
tall
trees
marking
the
horizon
and
beyond
a
depression
in
a
wood
surmounting
a
hill
at
a
distance
of
some
seven
or
eight
hundred
yards
stood
another
tower
squat
and
in
ruins
covered
with
ivy
from
top
to
bottom
rénine
resumed
his
inspection
he
seemed
to
consider
that
the
key
to
the
problem
lay
in
the
use
to
which
the
telescope
was
put
and
that
the
problem
would
be
solved
if
only
they
could
discover
this
use
he
studied
the
one
after
the
other
one
of
them
or
rather
the
place
which
it
had
occupied
attracted
his
attention
above
the
rest
in
the
middle
of
the
layer
of
plaster
which
had
served
to
block
it
there
was
a
hollow
filled
with
earth
in
which
plants
had
grown
he
pulled
out
the
plants
and
removed
the
earth
thus
clearing
the
mouth
of
a
hole
some
five
inches
in
diameter
which
completely
penetrated
the
wall
on
bending
forward
rénine
perceived
that
this
deep
and
narrow
opening
inevitably
carried
the
eye
above
the
dense
tops
of
the
trees
and
through
the
depression
in
the
hill
to
the
tower
at
the
bottom
of
this
channel
in
a
sort
of
groove
which
ran
through
it
like
a
gutter
the
telescope
fitted
so
exactly
that
it
was
quite
impossible
to
shift
it
however
little
either
to
the
right
or
to
the
left
rénine
after
wiping
the
outside
of
the
lenses
while
taking
care
not
to
disturb
the
lie
of
the
instrument
by
a
hair
breadth
put
his
eye
to
the
small
end
he
remained
for
thirty
or
forty
seconds
gazing
attentively
and
silently
then
he
drew
himself
up
and
said
in
a
husky
voice
it
terrible
it
really
terrible
what
is
she
asked
anxiously
look
she
bent
down
but
the
image
was
not
clear
to
her
and
the
telescope
had
to
be
focussed
to
suit
her
sight
the
next
moment
she
shuddered
and
said
it
two
scarecrows
is
it
both
stuck
up
on
the
top
but
why
look
again
he
said
look
more
carefully
under
the
hats
the
faces
oh
she
cried
turning
faint
with
horror
how
awful
the
field
of
the
telescope
like
the
circular
picture
shown
by
a
magic
lantern
presented
this
spectacle
the
platform
of
a
broken
tower
the
walls
of
which
were
higher
in
the
more
distant
part
and
formed
as
it
were
a
over
which
surged
waves
of
ivy
in
front
amid
a
cluster
of
bushes
were
two
human
beings
a
man
and
a
woman
leaning
back
against
a
heap
of
fallen
stones
but
the
words
man
and
woman
could
hardly
be
applied
to
these
two
forms
these
two
sinister
puppets
which
it
is
true
wore
clothes
and
hats
or
rather
shreds
of
clothes
and
remnants
of
hats
but
had
lost
their
eyes
their
cheeks
their
chins
every
particle
of
flesh
until
they
were
actually
and
positively
nothing
more
than
two
skeletons
two
skeletons
stammered
hortense
two
skeletons
with
clothes
on
who
carried
them
up
there
nobody
but
still
that
man
and
that
woman
must
have
died
at
the
top
of
the
tower
years
and
years
ago
and
their
flesh
rotted
under
their
clothes
and
the
ravens
ate
them
but
it
hideous
hideous
cried
hortense
pale
as
death
her
face
drawn
with
horror
half
an
hour
later
hortense
daniel
and
rénine
left
the
château
de
halingre
before
their
departure
they
had
gone
as
far
as
the
tower
the
remains
of
an
old
more
than
half
demolished
the
inside
was
empty
there
seemed
to
have
been
a
way
of
climbing
to
the
top
at
a
comparatively
recent
period
by
means
of
wooden
stairs
and
ladders
which
now
lay
broken
and
scattered
over
the
ground
the
tower
backed
against
the
wall
which
marked
the
end
of
the
park
a
curious
fact
which
surprised
hortense
was
that
prince
rénine
had
neglected
to
pursue
a
more
minute
enquiry
as
though
the
matter
had
lost
all
interest
for
him
he
did
not
even
speak
of
it
any
longer
and
in
the
inn
at
which
they
stopped
and
took
a
light
meal
in
the
nearest
village
it
was
she
who
asked
the
landlord
about
the
abandoned
château
but
she
learnt
nothing
from
him
for
the
man
was
new
to
the
district
and
could
give
her
no
particulars
he
did
not
even
know
the
name
of
the
owner
they
turned
their
horses
heads
towards
la
marèze
again
and
again
hortense
recalled
the
squalid
sight
which
had
met
their
eyes
but
rénine
who
was
in
a
lively
mood
and
full
of
attentions
to
his
companion
seemed
utterly
indifferent
to
those
questions
but
after
all
she
exclaimed
impatiently
we
ca
leave
the
matter
there
it
calls
for
a
solution
as
you
say
he
replied
a
solution
is
called
for
rossigny
has
to
know
where
he
stands
and
you
have
to
decide
what
to
do
about
him
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
he
of
no
importance
for
the
moment
the
thing
is
what
is
to
know
what
those
two
dead
bodies
are
still
rossigny
rossigny
can
wait
but
i
ca
you
have
shown
me
a
mystery
which
is
now
the
only
thing
that
matters
what
do
you
intend
to
do
to
do
yes
there
are
two
bodies
you
inform
the
police
i
suppose
gracious
goodness
he
exclaimed
laughing
what
for
well
there
a
riddle
that
has
to
be
cleared
up
at
all
costs
a
terrible
tragedy
we
do
need
any
one
to
do
that
what
do
you
mean
to
say
that
you
understand
it
almost
as
plainly
as
though
i
had
read
it
in
a
book
told
in
full
detail
with
explanatory
illustrations
it
all
so
simple
she
looked
at
him
askance
wondering
if
he
was
making
fun
of
her
but
he
seemed
quite
serious
well
she
asked
quivering
with
curiosity
the
light
was
beginning
to
wane
they
had
trotted
at
a
good
pace
and
the
hunt
was
returning
as
they
neared
la
marèze
well
he
said
we
shall
get
the
rest
of
our
information
from
people
living
round
about
from
your
uncle
for
instance
and
you
will
see
how
logically
all
the
facts
fit
in
when
you
hold
the
first
link
of
a
chain
you
are
bound
whether
you
like
it
or
not
to
reach
the
last
it
the
greatest
fun
in
the
world
once
in
the
house
they
separated
on
going
to
her
room
hortense
found
her
luggage
and
a
furious
letter
from
rossigny
in
which
he
bade
her
and
announced
his
departure
then
rénine
knocked
at
her
door
your
uncle
is
in
the
library
he
said
will
you
go
down
with
me
sent
word
that
i
am
coming
she
went
with
him
he
added
one
word
more
this
morning
when
i
thwarted
your
plans
and
begged
you
to
trust
me
i
naturally
undertook
an
obligation
towards
you
which
i
mean
to
fulfill
without
delay
i
want
to
give
you
a
positive
proof
of
this
she
laughed
the
only
obligation
which
you
took
upon
yourself
was
to
satisfy
my
curiosity
it
shall
be
satisfied
he
assured
her
gravely
and
more
fully
than
you
can
possibly
imagine
was
alone
he
was
smoking
his
pipe
and
drinking
sherry
he
offered
a
glass
to
rénine
who
refused
well
hortense
he
said
in
a
rather
thick
voice
you
know
that
pretty
dull
here
except
in
these
september
days
you
must
make
the
most
of
them
have
you
had
a
pleasant
ride
with
rénine
that
just
what
i
wanted
to
talk
about
my
dear
sir
interrupted
the
prince
you
must
excuse
me
but
i
have
to
go
to
the
station
in
ten
minutes
to
meet
a
friend
of
my
wife
oh
ten
minutes
will
be
ample
just
the
time
to
smoke
a
cigarette
no
longer
he
took
a
cigarette
from
the
case
which
handed
to
him
lit
it
and
said
i
must
tell
you
that
our
ride
happened
to
take
us
to
an
old
domain
which
you
are
sure
to
know
the
domaine
de
halingre
certainly
i
know
it
but
it
has
been
closed
boarded
up
for
years
or
so
you
were
able
to
get
in
i
suppose
yes
we
were
really
was
it
interesting
extremely
we
discovered
the
strangest
things
what
things
asked
the
count
looking
at
his
watch
rénine
described
what
they
had
seen
on
a
tower
some
way
from
the
house
there
were
two
dead
bodies
two
skeletons
rather
a
man
and
a
woman
still
wearing
the
clothes
which
they
had
on
when
they
were
murdered
come
come
now
murdered
yes
and
that
is
what
we
have
come
to
trouble
you
about
the
tragedy
must
date
back
to
some
twenty
years
ago
was
nothing
known
of
it
at
the
time
certainly
not
declared
the
count
i
never
heard
of
any
such
crime
or
disappearance
oh
really
said
rénine
looking
a
little
disappointed
i
hoped
to
obtain
a
few
particulars
i
sorry
in
that
case
i
apologise
he
consulted
hortense
with
a
glance
and
moved
towards
the
door
but
on
second
thought
could
you
not
at
least
my
dear
sir
bring
me
into
touch
with
some
persons
in
the
neighbourhood
some
members
of
your
family
who
might
know
more
about
it
of
my
family
and
why
because
the
domaine
de
halingre
used
to
belong
and
no
doubt
still
belongs
to
the
the
arms
are
an
eagle
on
a
heap
of
stones
on
a
rock
this
at
once
suggested
the
connection
this
time
the
count
appeared
surprised
he
pushed
back
his
decanter
and
his
glass
of
sherry
and
said
what
this
you
telling
me
i
had
no
idea
that
we
had
any
such
neighbours
rénine
shook
his
head
and
smiled
i
should
be
more
inclined
to
believe
sir
that
you
were
not
very
eager
to
admit
any
relationship
between
yourself
and
the
unknown
owner
of
the
property
then
he
not
a
respectable
man
the
man
to
put
it
plainly
is
a
murderer
what
do
you
mean
the
count
had
risen
from
his
chair
hortense
greatly
excited
said
are
you
really
sure
that
there
has
been
a
murder
and
that
the
murder
was
done
by
some
one
belonging
to
the
house
quite
sure
but
why
are
you
so
certain
because
i
know
who
the
two
victims
were
and
what
caused
them
to
be
killed
prince
rénine
was
making
none
but
positive
statements
and
his
method
suggested
the
belief
that
he
supported
by
the
strongest
proofs
strode
up
and
down
the
room
with
his
hands
behind
his
back
he
ended
by
saying
i
always
had
an
instinctive
feeling
that
something
had
happened
but
i
never
tried
to
find
out
now
as
a
matter
of
fact
twenty
years
ago
a
relation
of
mine
a
distant
cousin
used
to
live
at
the
domaine
de
halingre
i
hoped
because
of
the
name
i
bear
that
this
story
which
as
i
say
i
never
knew
but
suspected
would
remain
hidden
for
ever
so
this
cousin
killed
somebody
yes
he
was
obliged
to
rénine
shook
his
head
i
am
sorry
to
have
to
amend
that
phrase
my
dear
sir
the
truth
on
the
contrary
is
that
your
cousin
took
his
victims
lives
in
cold
blood
and
in
a
cowardly
manner
i
never
heard
of
a
crime
more
deliberately
and
craftily
planned
what
is
it
that
you
know
the
moment
had
come
for
rénine
to
explain
himself
a
solemn
and
moment
the
full
gravity
of
which
hortense
understood
though
she
had
not
yet
divined
any
part
of
the
tragedy
which
the
prince
unfolded
step
by
step
it
a
very
simple
story
he
said
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
was
married
and
that
there
was
another
couple
living
in
the
neighbourhood
with
whom
the
owner
of
the
domaine
de
halingre
were
on
friendly
terms
what
happened
one
day
which
of
these
four
persons
first
disturbed
the
relations
between
the
two
households
i
am
unable
to
say
but
a
likely
version
which
at
once
occurs
to
the
mind
is
that
your
wife
madame
was
in
the
habit
of
meeting
the
other
husband
in
the
tower
which
had
a
door
opening
outside
the
estate
on
discovering
the
intrigue
your
cousin
resolved
to
be
revenged
but
in
such
a
manner
that
there
should
be
no
scandal
and
that
no
one
even
should
ever
know
that
the
guilty
pair
had
been
killed
now
he
had
ascertained
as
i
did
just
now
that
there
was
a
part
of
the
house
the
belvedere
from
which
you
can
see
over
the
trees
and
the
undulations
of
the
park
the
tower
standing
eight
hundred
yards
away
and
that
this
was
the
only
place
that
overlooked
the
top
of
the
tower
he
therefore
pierced
a
hole
in
the
parapet
through
one
of
the
former
loopholes
and
from
there
by
using
a
telescope
which
fitted
exactly
in
the
grove
which
he
had
hollowed
out
he
watched
the
meetings
of
the
two
lovers
and
it
was
from
there
also
that
after
carefully
taking
all
his
measurements
and
calculating
all
his
distances
on
a
sunday
the
of
september
when
the
house
was
empty
he
killed
them
with
two
shots
the
truth
was
becoming
apparent
the
light
of
day
was
breaking
the
count
muttered
yes
that
what
must
have
happened
i
expect
that
my
cousin
the
murderer
rénine
continued
stopped
up
the
loophole
neatly
with
a
clod
of
earth
no
one
would
ever
know
that
two
dead
bodies
were
decaying
on
the
top
of
that
tower
which
was
never
visited
and
of
which
he
took
the
precaution
to
demolish
the
wooden
stairs
nothing
therefore
remained
for
him
to
do
but
to
explain
the
disappearance
of
his
wife
and
his
friend
this
presented
no
difficulty
he
accused
them
of
having
eloped
together
hortense
gave
a
start
suddenly
as
though
the
last
sentence
were
a
complete
and
to
her
an
absolutely
unexpected
revelation
she
understood
what
rénine
was
trying
to
convey
what
do
you
mean
she
asked
i
mean
that
accused
his
wife
and
his
friend
of
eloping
together
no
no
she
cried
i
ca
allow
that
you
are
speaking
of
a
cousin
of
my
uncle
why
mix
up
the
two
stories
why
mix
up
this
story
with
another
which
took
place
at
that
time
said
the
prince
but
i
am
not
mixing
them
up
my
dear
madame
there
is
only
one
story
and
i
am
telling
it
as
it
happened
hortense
turned
to
her
uncle
he
sat
silent
with
his
arms
folded
and
his
head
remained
in
the
shadow
cast
by
the
why
had
he
not
protested
rénine
repeated
in
a
firm
tone
there
is
only
one
story
on
the
evening
of
that
very
day
the
of
september
at
eight
doubtless
alleging
as
his
reason
that
he
was
going
in
pursuit
of
the
runaway
couple
left
his
house
after
boarding
up
the
entrance
he
went
away
leaving
all
the
rooms
as
they
were
and
removing
only
the
firearms
from
their
glass
case
at
the
last
minute
he
had
a
presentiment
which
has
been
justified
that
the
discovery
of
the
telescope
which
had
played
so
great
a
part
in
the
preparation
of
his
crime
might
serve
as
a
clue
to
an
enquiry
and
he
threw
it
into
the
where
as
luck
would
have
it
it
interrupted
the
swing
of
the
pendulum
this
unreflecting
action
one
of
those
which
every
criminal
inevitably
commits
was
to
betray
him
twenty
years
later
just
now
the
blows
which
i
struck
to
force
the
door
of
the
released
the
pendulum
the
clock
was
set
going
struck
eight
and
i
possessed
the
clue
of
thread
which
was
to
lead
me
through
the
labyrinth
proofs
stammered
hortense
proofs
proofs
replied
rénine
in
a
loud
voice
why
there
are
any
number
of
proofs
and
you
know
them
as
well
as
i
do
who
could
have
killed
at
that
distance
of
eight
hundred
yards
except
an
expert
shot
an
ardent
sportsman
you
agree
do
you
not
proofs
why
was
nothing
removed
from
the
house
nothing
except
the
guns
those
guns
which
an
ardent
sportsman
can
not
afford
to
leave
behind
you
agree
those
guns
which
we
find
here
hanging
in
trophies
on
the
walls
proofs
what
about
that
date
the
of
september
which
was
the
date
of
the
crime
and
which
has
left
such
a
horrible
memory
in
the
criminal
mind
that
every
year
at
this
time
at
this
time
alone
he
surrounds
himself
with
distractions
and
that
every
year
on
this
same
of
september
he
forgets
his
habits
of
temperance
well
is
the
of
september
proofs
why
if
there
were
any
others
would
that
not
be
enough
for
you
and
rénine
flinging
out
his
arm
pointed
to
the
comte
who
terrified
by
this
evocation
of
the
past
had
sunk
huddled
into
a
chair
and
was
hiding
his
head
in
his
hands
hortense
did
not
attempt
to
argue
with
him
she
had
never
liked
her
uncle
or
rather
her
husband
uncle
she
now
accepted
the
accusation
laid
against
him
sixty
seconds
passed
then
walked
up
to
them
and
said
whether
the
story
be
true
or
not
you
ca
call
a
husband
a
criminal
for
avenging
his
honour
and
killing
his
faithless
wife
no
replied
rénine
but
i
have
told
only
the
first
version
of
the
story
there
is
another
which
is
infinitely
more
serious
and
more
probable
one
to
which
a
more
thorough
investigation
would
be
sure
to
lead
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
this
it
may
not
be
a
matter
of
a
husband
taking
the
law
into
his
own
hands
as
i
charitably
supposed
it
may
be
a
matter
of
a
ruined
man
who
covets
his
friend
money
and
his
friend
wife
and
who
with
this
object
in
view
to
secure
his
freedom
to
get
rid
of
his
friend
and
of
his
own
wife
draws
them
into
a
trap
suggests
to
them
that
they
should
visit
that
lonely
tower
and
kills
them
by
shooting
them
from
a
distance
safely
under
cover
no
no
the
count
protested
no
all
that
is
untrue
i
do
say
it
is
i
am
basing
my
accusation
on
proofs
but
also
on
intuitions
and
arguments
which
up
to
now
have
been
extremely
accurate
all
the
same
i
admit
that
the
second
version
may
be
incorrect
but
if
so
why
feel
any
remorse
one
does
not
feel
remorse
for
punishing
guilty
people
one
does
for
taking
life
it
is
a
crushing
burden
to
bear
was
it
to
give
himself
greater
strength
to
bear
this
burden
that
afterwards
married
his
victim
widow
for
that
sir
is
the
crux
of
the
question
what
was
the
motive
of
that
marriage
was
penniless
was
the
woman
he
was
taking
as
his
second
wife
rich
or
were
they
both
in
love
with
each
other
and
did
plan
with
her
to
kill
his
first
wife
and
the
husband
of
his
second
wife
these
are
problems
to
which
i
do
not
know
the
answer
they
have
no
interest
for
the
moment
but
the
police
with
all
the
means
at
their
disposal
would
have
no
great
difficulty
in
elucidating
them
staggered
and
had
to
steady
himself
against
the
back
of
a
chair
livid
in
the
face
he
spluttered
are
you
going
to
inform
the
police
no
no
said
rénine
to
begin
with
there
is
the
statute
of
limitations
then
there
are
twenty
years
of
remorse
and
dread
a
memory
which
will
pursue
the
criminal
to
his
dying
hour
accompanied
no
doubt
by
domestic
discord
hatred
a
daily
hell
and
in
the
end
the
necessity
of
returning
to
the
tower
and
removing
the
traces
of
the
two
murders
the
frightful
punishment
of
climbing
that
tower
of
touching
those
skeletons
of
undressing
them
and
burying
them
that
will
be
enough
we
will
not
ask
for
more
we
will
not
give
it
to
the
public
to
batten
on
and
create
a
scandal
which
would
recoil
upon
niece
no
let
us
leave
this
disgraceful
business
alone
the
count
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
with
his
hands
clutching
his
forehead
and
asked
then
why
why
do
i
interfere
said
rénine
what
you
mean
is
that
i
must
have
had
some
object
in
speaking
that
is
so
there
must
indeed
be
a
penalty
however
slight
and
our
interview
must
lead
to
some
practical
result
but
have
no
fear
will
be
let
off
lightly
the
contest
was
ended
the
count
felt
that
he
had
only
a
small
formality
to
fulfil
a
sacrifice
to
accept
and
recovering
some
of
his
he
said
in
an
almost
sarcastic
tone
what
your
price
rénine
burst
out
laughing
splendid
you
see
the
position
only
you
make
a
mistake
in
drawing
me
into
the
business
i
working
for
the
glory
of
the
thing
in
that
case
you
will
be
called
upon
at
most
to
make
restitution
restitution
rénine
leant
over
the
table
and
said
in
one
of
those
drawers
is
a
deed
awaiting
your
signature
it
is
a
draft
agreement
between
you
and
your
niece
hortense
daniel
relating
to
her
private
fortune
which
fortune
was
squandered
and
for
which
you
are
responsible
sign
the
deed
gave
a
start
do
you
know
the
amount
i
do
wish
to
know
it
and
if
i
refuse
i
shall
ask
to
see
the
comtesse
without
further
hesitation
the
count
opened
a
drawer
produced
a
document
on
stamped
paper
and
quickly
signed
it
here
you
are
he
said
and
i
hope
you
hope
as
i
do
that
you
and
i
may
never
have
any
future
dealings
convinced
of
it
i
shall
leave
this
evening
your
niece
no
doubt
tomorrow
in
the
which
was
still
empty
while
the
guests
at
the
house
were
dressing
for
dinner
rénine
handed
the
deed
to
hortense
she
seemed
dazed
by
all
that
she
had
heard
and
the
thing
that
bewildered
her
even
more
than
the
relentless
light
shed
upon
her
uncle
past
was
the
miraculous
insight
and
amazing
lucidity
displayed
by
this
man
the
man
who
for
some
hours
had
controlled
events
and
conjured
up
before
her
eyes
the
actual
scenes
of
a
tragedy
which
no
one
had
beheld
are
you
satisfied
with
me
he
asked
she
gave
him
both
her
hands
you
have
saved
me
from
rossigny
you
have
given
me
back
my
freedom
and
my
independence
i
thank
you
from
the
bottom
of
my
heart
oh
that
not
what
i
am
asking
you
to
say
he
answered
my
first
and
main
object
was
to
amuse
you
your
life
seemed
so
humdrum
and
lacking
in
the
unexpected
has
it
been
so
how
can
you
ask
such
a
question
i
have
had
the
strangest
and
most
stirring
experiences
that
is
life
he
said
when
one
knows
how
to
use
one
eyes
adventure
exists
everywhere
in
the
meanest
hovel
under
the
mask
of
the
wisest
of
men
everywhere
if
you
are
only
willing
you
will
find
an
excuse
for
excitement
for
doing
good
for
saving
a
victim
for
ending
an
injustice
impressed
by
his
power
and
authority
she
murmured
who
are
you
exactly
an
adventurer
nothing
more
a
lover
of
adventures
life
is
not
worth
living
except
in
moments
of
adventure
the
adventures
of
others
or
personal
adventures
has
upset
you
because
it
affected
the
innermost
depths
of
your
being
but
those
of
others
are
no
less
stimulating
would
you
like
to
make
the
experiment
how
become
the
companion
of
my
adventures
if
any
one
calls
on
me
for
help
help
him
with
me
if
chance
or
instinct
puts
me
on
the
track
of
a
crime
or
the
trace
of
a
sorrow
let
us
both
set
out
together
do
you
consent
yes
she
said
but
she
hesitated
as
though
trying
to
guess
rénine
secret
intentions
but
he
said
expressing
her
thoughts
for
her
with
a
smile
you
are
a
trifle
sceptical
what
you
are
saying
to
yourself
is
far
does
that
lover
of
adventures
want
to
make
me
go
it
is
quite
obvious
that
i
attract
him
and
sooner
or
later
he
would
not
be
sorry
to
receive
payment
for
his
services
you
are
quite
right
we
must
have
a
formal
contract
very
formal
said
hortense
preferring
to
give
a
jesting
tone
to
the
conversation
let
me
hear
your
proposals
he
reflected
for
a
moment
and
continued
well
we
say
this
the
clock
at
halingre
gave
eight
strokes
this
afternoon
the
day
of
the
first
adventure
will
you
accept
its
decree
and
agree
to
carry
out
seven
more
of
these
delightful
enterprises
with
me
during
a
period
for
instance
of
three
months
and
shall
we
say
that
at
the
eighth
you
will
be
pledged
to
grant
me
what
he
deferred
his
answer
observe
that
you
will
always
be
at
liberty
to
leave
me
on
the
road
if
i
do
not
succeed
in
interesting
you
but
if
you
accompany
me
to
the
end
if
you
allow
me
to
begin
and
complete
the
eighth
enterprise
with
you
in
three
months
on
the
of
december
at
the
very
moment
when
the
eighth
stroke
of
that
clock
sounds
and
it
will
sound
you
may
be
sure
of
that
for
the
old
brass
pendulum
will
not
stop
swinging
again
you
will
be
pledged
to
grant
me
what
she
repeated
a
little
unnerved
by
waiting
he
was
silent
he
looked
at
the
beautiful
lips
which
he
had
meant
to
claim
as
his
reward
he
felt
perfectly
certain
that
hortense
had
understood
and
he
thought
it
unnecessary
to
speak
more
plainly
the
mere
delight
of
seeing
you
will
be
enough
to
satisfy
me
it
is
not
for
me
but
for
you
to
impose
conditions
name
them
what
do
you
demand
she
was
grateful
for
his
respect
and
said
laughingly
what
do
i
demand
yes
can
i
demand
anything
i
like
however
difficult
and
impossible
everything
is
easy
and
everything
is
possible
to
the
man
who
is
bent
on
winning
you
then
she
said
i
demand
that
you
shall
restore
to
me
a
small
antique
clasp
made
of
a
cornelian
set
in
a
silver
mount
it
came
to
me
from
my
mother
and
everyone
knew
that
it
used
to
bring
her
happiness
and
me
too
since
the
day
when
it
vanished
from
my
i
have
had
nothing
but
unhappiness
restore
it
to
me
my
good
genius
when
was
the
clasp
stolen
she
answered
gaily
seven
years
ago
or
eight
or
nine
i
do
know
exactly
i
know
where
i
do
know
how
i
know
nothing
about
it
i
will
find
it
rénine
declared
and
you
shall
be
happy
ii
the
four
days
after
she
had
settled
down
in
paris
hortense
daniel
agreed
to
meet
prince
rénine
in
the
bois
it
was
a
glorious
morning
and
they
sat
down
on
the
terrace
of
the
restaurant
impérial
a
little
to
one
side
hortense
feeling
glad
to
be
alive
was
in
a
playful
mood
full
of
attractive
grace
rénine
lest
he
should
startle
her
refrained
from
alluding
to
the
compact
into
which
they
had
entered
at
his
suggestion
she
told
him
how
she
had
left
la
marèze
and
said
that
she
had
not
heard
of
rossigny
i
have
said
rénine
i
heard
of
him
oh
yes
he
sent
me
a
challenge
we
fought
a
duel
this
morning
rossigny
got
a
scratch
in
the
shoulder
that
finished
the
duel
let
talk
of
something
else
there
was
no
further
mention
of
rossigny
rénine
at
once
expounded
to
hortense
the
plan
of
two
enterprises
which
he
had
in
view
and
in
which
he
offered
with
no
great
enthusiasm
to
let
her
share
the
finest
adventure
he
declared
is
that
which
we
do
not
foresee
it
comes
unexpectedly
unannounced
and
no
one
save
the
initiated
realizes
that
an
opportunity
to
act
and
to
expend
one
energies
is
close
at
hand
it
has
to
be
seized
at
once
a
moment
hesitation
may
mean
that
we
are
too
late
we
are
warned
by
a
special
sense
like
that
of
a
which
distinguishes
the
right
scent
from
all
the
others
that
cross
it
the
terrace
was
beginning
to
fill
up
around
them
at
the
next
table
sat
a
young
man
reading
a
newspaper
they
were
able
to
see
his
insignificant
profile
and
his
long
dark
moustache
from
behind
them
through
an
open
window
of
the
restaurant
came
the
distant
strains
of
a
band
in
one
of
the
rooms
a
few
couples
were
dancing
as
rénine
was
paying
for
the
refreshments
the
young
man
with
the
long
moustache
stifled
a
cry
and
in
a
choking
voice
called
one
of
the
waiters
what
do
i
owe
you
no
change
oh
good
lord
hurry
up
rénine
without
a
moment
hesitation
had
picked
up
the
paper
after
casting
a
swift
glance
down
the
page
he
read
under
his
breath
maître
dourdens
the
counsel
for
the
defence
in
the
trial
of
jacques
aubrieux
has
been
received
at
the
élysée
we
are
informed
that
the
president
of
the
republic
has
refused
to
reprieve
the
condemned
man
and
that
the
execution
will
take
place
morning
after
crossing
the
terrace
the
young
man
found
himself
faced
at
the
entrance
to
the
garden
by
a
lady
and
gentleman
who
blocked
his
way
and
the
latter
said
excuse
me
sir
but
i
noticed
your
agitation
it
about
jacques
aubrieux
is
it
yes
yes
jacques
aubrieux
the
young
man
stammered
jacques
the
friend
of
my
childhood
i
hurrying
to
see
his
wife
she
must
be
beside
herself
with
grief
can
i
offer
you
my
assistance
i
am
prince
rénine
this
lady
and
i
would
be
happy
to
call
on
madame
aubrieux
and
to
place
our
services
at
her
disposal
the
young
man
upset
by
the
news
which
he
had
read
seemed
not
to
understand
he
introduced
himself
awkwardly
my
name
is
dutreuil
gaston
dutreuil
rénine
beckoned
to
his
chauffeur
who
was
waiting
at
some
little
distance
and
pushed
gaston
dutreuil
into
the
car
asking
what
address
where
does
madame
aubrieux
live
avenue
du
roule
after
helping
hortense
in
rénine
repeated
the
address
to
the
chauffeur
and
as
soon
as
they
drove
off
tried
to
question
gaston
dutreuil
i
know
very
little
of
the
case
he
said
tell
it
to
me
as
briefly
as
you
can
jacques
aubrieux
killed
one
of
his
near
relations
did
he
he
is
innocent
sir
replied
the
young
man
who
seemed
incapable
of
giving
the
least
explanation
innocent
i
swear
it
i
been
friend
for
twenty
years
he
is
innocent
and
it
would
be
monstrous
there
was
nothing
to
be
got
out
of
him
besides
it
was
only
a
short
drive
they
entered
neuilly
through
the
porte
des
sablons
and
two
minutes
later
stopped
before
a
long
narrow
passage
between
high
walls
which
led
them
to
a
small
house
gaston
dutreuil
rang
madame
is
in
the
with
her
mother
said
the
maid
who
opened
the
door
i
go
in
to
the
ladies
he
said
taking
rénine
and
hortense
with
him
it
was
a
room
which
in
ordinary
times
must
have
been
used
also
as
a
study
two
women
sat
weeping
one
of
whom
elderly
and
came
up
to
gaston
dutreuil
he
explained
the
reason
for
rénine
presence
and
she
at
once
cried
amid
her
sobs
my
daughter
husband
is
innocent
sir
jacques
a
better
man
never
lived
he
was
so
murder
his
cousin
but
he
worshipped
his
cousin
i
swear
that
he
not
guilty
sir
and
they
are
going
to
commit
the
infamy
of
putting
him
to
death
oh
sir
it
will
kill
my
daughter
rénine
realized
that
all
these
people
had
been
living
for
months
under
the
obsession
of
that
innocence
and
in
the
certainty
that
an
innocent
man
could
never
be
executed
the
news
of
the
execution
which
was
now
inevitable
was
driving
them
mad
he
went
up
to
a
poor
creature
bent
in
two
whose
face
a
quite
young
face
framed
in
pretty
flaxen
hair
was
convulsed
with
desperate
grief
hortense
who
had
already
taken
a
seat
beside
her
gently
drew
her
head
against
her
shoulder
rénine
said
to
her
madame
i
do
not
know
what
i
can
do
for
you
but
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
if
any
one
in
this
world
can
be
of
use
to
you
it
is
myself
i
therefore
implore
you
to
answer
my
questions
as
though
the
clear
and
definite
wording
of
your
replies
were
able
to
alter
the
aspect
of
things
and
as
though
you
wished
to
make
me
share
your
opinion
of
jacques
aubrieux
for
he
is
innocent
is
he
not
oh
sir
indeed
he
is
she
exclaimed
and
the
woman
whole
soul
was
in
the
words
you
are
certain
of
it
but
you
were
unable
to
communicate
your
certainty
to
the
court
well
you
must
now
compel
me
to
share
it
i
am
not
asking
you
to
go
into
details
and
to
live
again
through
the
hideous
torment
which
you
have
suffered
but
merely
to
answer
certain
questions
will
you
do
this
i
will
rénine
influence
over
her
was
complete
with
a
few
sentences
rénine
had
succeeded
in
subduing
her
and
inspiring
her
with
the
will
to
obey
and
once
more
hortense
realized
all
the
man
power
authority
and
persuasion
what
was
your
husband
he
asked
after
begging
the
mother
and
gaston
dutreuil
to
preserve
absolute
silence
an
lucky
in
business
until
last
year
yes
so
there
have
been
financial
difficulties
during
the
past
few
months
yes
and
the
murder
was
committed
when
last
march
on
a
sunday
who
was
the
victim
a
distant
cousin
guillaume
who
lived
at
suresnes
what
was
the
sum
stolen
sixty
notes
which
this
cousin
had
received
the
day
before
in
payment
of
a
debt
did
your
husband
know
that
yes
his
cousin
told
him
of
it
on
the
sunday
in
the
course
of
a
conversation
on
the
telephone
and
jacques
insisted
that
his
cousin
ought
not
to
keep
so
large
a
sum
in
the
house
and
that
he
ought
to
pay
it
into
a
bank
next
day
was
this
in
the
morning
at
one
in
the
afternoon
jacques
was
to
have
gone
to
guillaume
on
his
but
he
felt
tired
and
told
him
that
he
would
not
go
out
so
he
remained
here
all
day
alone
yes
the
two
servants
were
out
i
went
to
the
cinéma
des
ternes
with
my
mother
and
our
friend
dutreuil
in
the
evening
we
learnt
that
guillaume
had
been
murdered
next
morning
jacques
was
arrested
on
what
evidence
the
poor
creature
hesitated
to
reply
the
evidence
of
guilt
had
evidently
been
overwhelming
then
obeying
a
sign
from
rénine
she
answered
without
a
pause
the
murderer
went
to
suresnes
on
a
motorcycle
and
the
tracks
discovered
were
those
of
my
husband
machine
they
found
a
handkerchief
with
my
husband
initials
and
the
revolver
which
was
used
belonged
to
him
lastly
one
of
our
neighbours
maintains
that
he
saw
my
husband
go
out
on
his
bicycle
at
three
and
another
that
he
saw
him
come
in
at
four
the
murder
was
committed
at
four
and
what
does
jacques
aubrieux
say
in
his
defence
he
declares
that
he
slept
all
the
afternoon
during
that
time
some
one
came
who
managed
to
unlock
the
and
take
the
to
go
to
suresnes
as
for
the
handkerchief
and
the
revolver
they
were
in
the
there
would
be
nothing
surprising
in
the
murderer
using
them
it
seems
a
plausible
explanation
yes
but
the
prosecution
raised
two
objections
in
the
first
place
nobody
absolutely
nobody
knew
that
my
husband
was
going
to
stay
at
home
all
day
because
on
the
contrary
it
was
his
habit
to
go
out
on
his
every
sunday
afternoon
and
the
second
objection
she
flushed
and
murmured
the
murderer
went
to
the
pantry
at
guillaume
and
drank
half
a
bottle
of
wine
straight
out
of
the
bottle
which
shows
my
husband
fingerprints
it
seemed
as
though
her
strength
was
exhausted
and
as
though
at
the
same
time
the
unconscious
hope
which
rénine
intervention
had
awakened
in
her
had
suddenly
vanished
before
the
accumulation
of
adverse
facts
again
she
collapsed
withdrawn
into
a
sort
of
silent
meditation
from
which
affectionate
attentions
were
unable
to
distract
her
the
mother
stammered
he
not
guilty
is
he
sir
and
they
ca
punish
an
innocent
man
they
have
the
right
to
kill
my
daughter
oh
dear
oh
dear
what
have
we
done
to
be
tortured
like
this
my
poor
little
madeleine
she
will
kill
herself
said
dutreuil
in
a
scared
voice
she
will
never
be
able
to
endure
the
idea
that
they
are
guillotining
jacques
she
will
kill
herself
presently
this
very
night
rénine
was
striding
up
and
down
the
room
you
can
do
nothing
for
her
can
you
asked
hortense
it
eleven
now
he
replied
in
an
anxious
tone
and
it
to
happen
morning
do
you
think
he
guilty
i
do
know
i
do
know
the
poor
woman
conviction
is
too
impressive
to
be
neglected
when
two
people
have
lived
together
for
years
they
can
hardly
be
mistaken
about
each
other
to
that
degree
and
yet
he
stretched
himself
out
on
a
sofa
and
lit
a
cigarette
he
smoked
three
in
succession
without
a
word
from
any
one
to
interrupt
his
train
of
thought
from
time
to
time
he
looked
at
his
watch
every
minute
was
of
such
importance
at
last
he
went
back
to
madeleine
aubrieux
took
her
hands
and
said
very
gently
you
must
not
kill
yourself
there
is
hope
left
until
the
last
minute
has
come
and
i
promise
you
that
for
my
part
i
will
not
be
disheartened
until
that
last
minute
but
i
need
your
calmness
and
your
confidence
i
will
be
calm
she
said
with
a
pitiable
air
and
confident
and
confident
well
wait
for
me
i
shall
be
back
in
two
hours
from
now
will
you
come
with
us
m
dutreuil
as
they
were
stepping
into
his
car
he
asked
the
young
man
do
you
know
any
small
unfrequented
restaurant
not
too
far
inside
paris
there
the
brasserie
lutetia
on
the
of
the
house
in
which
i
live
on
the
place
des
ternes
capital
that
will
be
very
handy
they
scarcely
spoke
on
the
way
rénine
however
said
to
gaston
dutreuil
so
far
as
i
remember
the
numbers
of
the
notes
are
known
are
they
yes
guillaume
had
entered
the
sixty
numbers
in
his
rénine
muttered
a
moment
later
that
where
the
whole
problem
lies
where
are
the
notes
if
we
could
lay
our
hands
on
them
we
should
know
everything
at
the
brasserie
lutetia
there
was
a
telephone
in
the
private
room
where
he
asked
to
have
lunch
served
when
the
waiter
had
left
him
alone
with
hortense
and
dutreuil
he
took
down
the
receiver
with
a
resolute
air
hullo
prefecture
of
police
please
hullo
hullo
is
that
the
prefecture
of
police
please
put
me
on
to
the
criminal
investigation
department
i
have
a
very
important
communication
to
make
you
can
say
prince
rénine
holding
the
receiver
in
his
hand
he
turned
to
gaston
dutreuil
i
can
ask
some
one
to
come
here
i
suppose
we
shall
be
quite
undisturbed
quite
he
listened
again
the
secretary
to
the
head
of
the
criminal
investigation
department
oh
excellent
secretary
i
have
on
several
occasions
been
in
communication
with
dudouis
and
have
given
him
information
which
has
been
of
great
use
to
him
he
is
sure
to
remember
prince
rénine
i
may
be
able
to
show
him
where
the
sixty
notes
are
hidden
which
aubrieux
the
murderer
stole
from
his
cousin
if
he
interested
in
the
proposal
beg
him
to
send
an
inspector
to
the
brasserie
lutetia
place
des
ternes
i
shall
be
there
with
a
lady
and
dutreuil
aubrieux
friend
good
day
mr
secretary
when
rénine
hung
up
the
instrument
he
saw
the
amazed
faces
of
hortense
and
of
gaston
dutreuil
confronting
him
hortense
whispered
then
you
know
you
discovered
nothing
he
said
laughing
well
well
i
acting
as
though
i
knew
it
not
a
bad
method
let
have
some
lunch
shall
we
the
clock
marked
a
quarter
to
one
the
man
from
the
prefecture
will
be
here
he
said
in
twenty
minutes
at
latest
and
if
no
one
comes
hortense
objected
that
would
surprise
me
of
course
if
i
had
sent
a
message
to
dudouis
saying
is
innocent
i
should
have
failed
to
make
any
impression
it
not
the
least
use
on
the
eve
of
an
execution
to
attempt
to
convince
the
gentry
of
the
police
or
of
the
law
that
a
man
condemned
to
death
is
innocent
no
from
henceforth
jacques
aubrieux
belongs
to
the
executioner
but
the
prospect
of
securing
the
sixty
is
a
windfall
worth
taking
a
little
trouble
over
just
think
that
was
the
weak
point
in
the
indictment
those
sixty
notes
which
they
were
unable
to
trace
but
as
you
know
nothing
of
their
whereabouts
my
dear
girl
i
hope
you
do
mind
my
calling
you
so
my
dear
girl
when
a
man
ca
explain
this
or
that
physical
phenomenon
he
adopts
some
sort
of
theory
which
explains
the
various
manifestations
of
the
phenomenon
and
says
that
everything
happened
as
though
the
theory
were
correct
what
i
am
doing
that
amounts
to
saying
that
you
are
going
upon
a
supposition
rénine
did
not
reply
not
until
some
time
later
when
lunch
was
over
did
he
say
obviously
i
am
going
upon
a
supposition
if
i
had
several
days
before
me
i
should
take
the
trouble
of
first
verifying
my
theory
which
is
based
upon
intuition
quite
as
much
as
upon
a
few
scattered
facts
but
i
have
only
two
hours
and
i
am
embarking
on
the
unknown
path
as
though
i
were
certain
that
it
would
lead
me
to
the
truth
and
suppose
you
are
wrong
i
have
no
choice
besides
it
is
too
late
there
a
knock
oh
one
word
more
whatever
i
may
say
do
contradict
me
nor
you
m
dutreuil
he
opened
the
door
a
thin
man
with
a
red
imperial
entered
prince
rénine
yes
sir
you
of
course
are
from
m
dudouis
yes
and
the
newcomer
gave
his
name
morisseau
i
am
obliged
to
you
for
coming
so
promptly
said
prince
rénine
and
i
hope
that
dudouis
will
not
regret
having
placed
you
at
my
disposal
at
your
entire
disposal
in
addition
to
two
inspectors
whom
i
have
left
in
the
square
outside
and
who
have
been
in
the
case
with
me
from
the
first
i
shall
not
detain
you
for
any
length
of
time
said
rénine
and
i
will
not
even
ask
you
to
sit
down
we
have
only
a
few
minutes
in
which
to
settle
everything
you
know
what
it
all
about
the
sixty
notes
stolen
from
guillaume
i
have
the
numbers
here
rénine
ran
his
eyes
down
the
slip
of
paper
which
the
handed
him
and
said
that
right
the
two
lists
agree
inspector
morisseau
seemed
greatly
excited
the
chief
attaches
the
greatest
importance
to
your
discovery
so
you
will
be
able
to
show
me
rénine
was
silent
for
a
moment
and
then
declared
a
personal
investigation
and
a
most
exhaustive
investigation
it
was
as
i
will
explain
to
you
presently
has
revealed
the
fact
that
on
his
return
from
suresnes
the
murderer
after
replacing
the
in
the
shed
in
the
avenue
du
roule
ran
to
the
ternes
and
entered
this
house
this
house
yes
but
what
did
he
come
here
for
to
hide
the
proceeds
of
his
theft
the
sixty
how
do
you
mean
where
in
a
flat
of
which
he
had
the
key
on
the
fifth
floor
gaston
dutreuil
exclaimed
in
amazement
but
there
only
one
flat
on
the
fifth
floor
and
that
the
one
i
live
in
exactly
and
as
you
were
at
the
cinema
with
madame
aubrieux
and
her
mother
advantage
was
taken
of
your
absence
impossible
no
one
has
the
key
except
myself
one
can
get
in
without
a
key
but
i
have
seen
no
marks
of
any
kind
morisseau
intervened
come
let
us
understand
one
another
you
say
the
were
hidden
in
dutreuil
flat
yes
then
as
jacques
aubrieux
was
arrested
the
next
morning
the
notes
ought
to
be
there
still
that
my
opinion
gaston
dutreuil
could
not
help
laughing
but
that
absurd
i
should
have
found
them
did
you
look
for
them
no
but
i
should
have
come
across
them
at
any
moment
the
place
is
big
enough
to
swing
a
cat
in
would
you
care
to
see
it
however
small
it
may
be
it
large
enough
to
hold
sixty
bits
of
paper
of
course
everything
is
possible
said
dutreuil
still
i
must
repeat
that
nobody
to
my
knowledge
has
been
to
my
rooms
that
there
is
only
one
key
that
i
am
my
own
housekeeper
and
that
i
ca
quite
understand
hortense
too
could
not
understand
with
her
eyes
fixed
on
prince
rénine
she
was
trying
to
read
his
innermost
thoughts
what
game
was
he
playing
was
it
her
duty
to
support
his
statements
she
ended
by
saying
since
prince
rénine
maintains
that
the
notes
have
been
put
away
upstairs
would
the
simplest
thing
be
to
go
and
look
dutreuil
will
take
us
up
wo
you
this
minute
said
the
young
man
as
you
say
that
will
be
simplest
they
all
four
climbed
the
five
storys
of
the
house
and
after
dutreuil
had
opened
the
door
entered
a
tiny
set
of
chambers
consisting
of
a
bedroom
kitchen
and
bathroom
all
arranged
with
fastidious
neatness
it
was
easy
to
see
that
every
chair
in
the
occupied
a
definite
place
the
pipes
had
a
rack
to
themselves
so
had
the
matches
three
arranged
according
to
their
length
hung
from
three
nails
on
a
little
table
before
the
window
a
filled
with
awaited
the
felt
hat
which
dutreuil
carefully
placed
in
it
he
laid
his
gloves
beside
it
on
the
lid
he
did
all
this
with
sedate
and
mechanical
movements
like
a
man
who
loves
to
see
things
in
the
places
which
he
has
chosen
for
them
indeed
no
sooner
did
rénine
shift
something
than
dutreuil
made
a
slight
gesture
of
protest
took
out
his
hat
again
stuck
it
on
his
head
opened
the
window
and
rested
his
elbows
on
the
sill
with
his
back
turned
to
the
room
as
though
he
were
unable
to
bear
the
sight
of
such
vandalism
you
positive
are
you
not
the
inspector
asked
rénine
yes
yes
i
positive
that
the
sixty
notes
were
brought
here
after
the
murder
let
look
for
them
this
was
easy
and
soon
done
in
half
an
hour
not
a
corner
remained
unexplored
not
a
unlifted
nothing
said
inspector
morisseau
shall
we
continue
no
replied
rénine
the
notes
are
no
longer
here
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
that
they
have
been
removed
by
whom
ca
you
make
a
more
definite
accusation
rénine
did
not
reply
but
gaston
dutreuil
wheeled
round
he
was
choking
and
spluttered
mr
inspector
would
you
like
to
make
the
accusation
more
definite
as
conveyed
by
this
gentleman
remarks
it
all
means
that
there
a
dishonest
man
here
that
the
notes
hidden
by
the
murderer
were
discovered
and
stolen
by
that
dishonest
man
and
deposited
in
another
and
safer
place
that
is
your
idea
sir
is
it
not
and
you
accuse
me
of
committing
this
theft
do
you
he
came
forward
drumming
his
chest
with
his
fists
me
me
i
found
the
notes
did
i
and
kept
them
for
myself
you
dare
to
suggest
that
rénine
still
made
no
reply
dutreuil
flew
into
a
rage
and
taking
inspector
morisseau
aside
exclaimed
mr
inspector
i
strongly
protest
against
all
this
farce
and
against
the
part
which
you
are
unconsciously
playing
in
it
before
your
arrival
prince
rénine
told
this
lady
and
myself
that
he
knew
nothing
that
he
was
venturing
into
this
affair
at
random
and
that
he
was
following
the
first
road
that
offered
trusting
to
luck
do
you
deny
it
sir
rénine
did
not
open
his
lips
answer
me
will
you
explain
yourself
for
really
you
are
putting
forward
the
most
improbable
facts
without
any
proof
whatever
it
easy
enough
to
say
that
i
stole
the
notes
and
how
were
you
to
know
that
they
were
here
at
all
who
brought
them
here
why
should
the
murderer
choose
this
flat
to
hide
them
in
it
all
so
stupid
so
illogical
and
absurd
give
us
your
proofs
sir
one
single
proof
inspector
morisseau
seemed
perplexed
he
questioned
rénine
with
a
glance
rénine
said
since
you
want
specific
details
we
will
get
them
from
madame
aubrieux
herself
she
on
the
telephone
let
go
downstairs
we
shall
know
all
about
it
in
a
minute
dutreuil
shrugged
his
shoulders
as
you
please
but
what
a
waste
of
time
he
seemed
greatly
irritated
his
long
wait
at
the
window
under
a
blazing
sun
had
thrown
him
into
a
sweat
he
went
to
his
bedroom
and
returned
with
a
bottle
of
water
of
which
he
took
a
few
sips
afterwards
placing
the
bottle
on
the
come
along
he
said
prince
rénine
chuckled
you
seem
to
be
in
a
hurry
to
leave
the
place
i
in
a
hurry
to
show
you
up
retorted
dutreuil
slamming
the
door
they
went
downstairs
to
the
private
room
containing
the
telephone
the
room
was
empty
rénine
asked
gaston
dutreuil
for
the
aubrieuxs
number
took
down
the
instrument
and
was
put
through
the
maid
who
came
to
the
telephone
answered
that
madame
aubrieux
had
fainted
after
giving
way
to
an
access
of
despair
and
that
she
was
now
asleep
fetch
her
mother
please
prince
rénine
speaking
it
urgent
he
handed
the
second
receiver
to
morisseau
for
that
matter
the
voices
were
so
distinct
that
dutreuil
and
hortense
were
able
to
hear
every
word
exchanged
is
that
you
madame
yes
prince
rénine
i
believe
prince
rénine
oh
sir
what
news
have
you
for
me
is
there
any
hope
asked
the
old
lady
in
a
tone
of
entreaty
the
enquiry
is
proceeding
very
satisfactorily
said
rénine
and
you
may
hope
for
the
best
for
the
moment
i
want
you
to
give
me
some
very
important
particulars
on
the
day
of
the
murder
did
gaston
dutreuil
come
to
your
house
yes
he
came
to
fetch
my
daughter
and
myself
after
lunch
did
he
know
at
the
time
that
guillaume
had
sixty
thousand
francs
at
his
place
yes
i
told
him
and
that
jacques
aubrieux
was
not
feeling
very
well
and
was
proposing
not
to
take
his
usual
but
to
stay
at
home
and
sleep
yes
you
are
sure
absolutely
certain
and
you
all
three
went
to
the
cinema
together
yes
and
you
were
all
sitting
together
oh
no
there
was
no
room
he
took
a
seat
farther
away
a
seat
where
you
could
see
him
no
but
he
came
to
you
during
the
interval
no
we
did
not
see
him
until
we
were
going
out
there
is
no
doubt
of
that
none
at
all
very
well
madame
i
will
tell
you
the
result
of
my
efforts
in
an
time
but
above
all
do
wake
up
madame
aubrieux
and
suppose
she
wakes
of
her
own
accord
reassure
her
and
give
her
confidence
everything
is
going
well
very
well
indeed
he
hung
up
the
receiver
and
turned
to
dutreuil
laughing
ha
ha
my
boy
things
are
beginning
to
look
clearer
what
do
you
say
it
was
difficult
to
tell
what
these
words
meant
or
what
conclusions
rénine
had
drawn
from
his
conversation
the
silence
was
painful
and
oppressive
you
have
some
of
your
men
outside
have
you
two
it
important
that
they
should
be
there
please
also
ask
the
manager
not
to
disturb
us
on
any
account
and
when
morisseau
returned
rénine
closed
the
door
took
his
stand
in
front
of
dutreuil
and
speaking
in
a
but
emphatic
tone
said
it
amounts
to
this
young
man
that
the
ladies
saw
nothing
of
you
between
three
and
five
on
that
sunday
that
rather
a
curious
detail
a
perfectly
natural
detail
dutreuil
retorted
and
one
moreover
which
proves
nothing
at
all
it
proves
young
man
that
you
had
a
good
two
hours
at
your
disposal
obviously
two
hours
which
i
spent
at
the
cinema
or
somewhere
else
dutreuil
looked
at
him
somewhere
else
yes
as
you
were
free
you
had
plenty
of
time
to
go
wherever
you
liked
to
suresnes
for
instance
oh
said
the
young
man
jesting
in
his
turn
suresnes
is
a
long
way
off
it
quite
close
had
you
your
friend
jacques
aubrieux
a
fresh
pause
followed
these
words
dutreuil
had
knitted
his
brows
as
though
he
were
trying
to
understand
at
last
he
was
heard
to
whisper
so
that
is
what
he
was
trying
to
lead
up
to
the
brute
rénine
brought
down
his
hand
on
dutreuil
shoulder
no
more
talk
facts
gaston
dutreuil
you
are
the
only
person
who
on
that
day
knew
two
essential
things
first
that
cousin
guillaume
had
sixty
thousand
francs
in
his
house
secondly
that
jacques
aubrieux
was
not
going
out
you
at
once
saw
your
chance
the
was
available
you
slipped
out
during
the
performance
you
went
to
suresnes
you
killed
cousin
guillaume
you
took
the
sixty
and
left
them
at
your
rooms
and
at
five
you
went
back
to
fetch
the
ladies
dutreuil
had
listened
with
an
expression
at
once
mocking
and
flurried
casting
an
occasional
glance
at
inspector
morisseau
as
though
to
enlist
him
as
a
witness
the
man
mad
it
seemed
to
say
it
no
use
being
angry
with
him
when
rénine
had
finished
he
began
to
laugh
very
funny
a
capital
joke
so
it
was
i
whom
the
neighbours
saw
going
and
returning
on
the
it
was
you
disguised
in
jacques
aubrieux
clothes
and
it
was
my
that
were
found
on
the
bottle
in
guillaume
pantry
the
bottle
had
been
opened
by
jacques
aubrieux
at
lunch
in
his
own
house
and
it
was
you
who
took
it
with
you
to
serve
as
evidence
funnier
and
funnier
cried
dutreuil
who
had
the
air
of
being
frankly
amused
then
i
contrived
the
whole
affair
so
that
jacques
aubrieux
might
be
accused
of
the
crime
it
was
the
safest
means
of
not
being
accused
yourself
yes
but
jacques
is
a
friend
whom
i
have
known
from
childhood
you
in
love
with
his
wife
the
young
man
gave
a
sudden
infuriated
start
you
dare
what
you
dare
make
such
an
infamous
suggestion
i
have
proof
of
it
that
a
lie
i
have
always
respected
madeleine
aubrieux
and
revered
her
apparently
but
you
in
love
with
her
you
desire
her
do
contradict
me
i
have
abundant
proof
of
it
that
a
lie
i
tell
you
you
have
only
known
me
a
few
hours
come
come
i
been
quietly
watching
you
for
days
waiting
for
the
moment
to
pounce
upon
you
he
took
the
young
man
by
the
shoulders
and
shook
him
come
dutreuil
confess
i
hold
all
the
proofs
in
my
hand
i
have
witnesses
whom
we
shall
meet
presently
at
the
criminal
investigation
department
confess
ca
you
in
spite
of
everything
you
tortured
by
remorse
remember
your
dismay
at
the
restaurant
when
you
had
seen
the
newspaper
what
jacques
aubrieux
condemned
to
die
that
more
than
you
bargained
for
penal
servitude
would
have
suited
your
book
but
the
scaffold
jacques
aubrieux
executed
an
innocent
man
confess
wo
you
confess
to
save
your
own
skin
own
up
bending
over
the
other
he
was
trying
with
all
his
might
to
extort
a
confession
from
him
but
dutreuil
drew
himself
up
and
coldly
with
a
sort
of
scorn
in
his
voice
said
sir
you
are
a
madman
not
a
word
that
you
have
said
has
any
sense
in
it
all
your
accusations
are
false
what
about
the
did
you
find
them
at
my
place
as
you
said
you
would
rénine
exasperated
clenched
his
fist
in
his
face
oh
you
swine
i
dish
you
yet
i
swear
i
will
he
drew
the
inspector
aside
well
what
do
you
say
to
it
an
arrant
rogue
is
he
the
inspector
nodded
his
head
it
may
be
but
all
the
same
so
far
there
no
real
evidence
wait
morisseau
said
rénine
wait
until
we
had
our
interview
with
dudouis
for
we
shall
see
dudouis
at
the
prefecture
shall
we
not
yes
he
be
there
at
three
well
you
be
convinced
mr
inspector
i
tell
you
here
and
now
that
you
will
be
convinced
rénine
was
chuckling
like
a
man
who
feels
certain
of
the
course
of
events
hortense
who
was
standing
near
him
and
was
able
to
speak
to
him
without
being
heard
by
the
others
asked
in
a
low
voice
you
got
him
have
you
he
nodded
his
head
in
assent
got
him
i
should
think
i
have
all
the
same
i
no
farther
forward
than
i
was
at
the
beginning
but
this
is
awful
and
your
proofs
not
the
shadow
of
a
proof
i
was
hoping
to
trip
him
up
but
he
kept
his
feet
the
rascal
still
you
certain
it
he
it
ca
be
any
one
else
i
had
an
intuition
at
the
very
outset
and
not
taken
my
eyes
off
him
since
i
have
seen
his
anxiety
increasing
as
my
investigations
seemed
to
centre
on
him
and
concern
him
more
closely
now
i
know
and
he
in
love
with
madame
aubrieux
in
logic
he
bound
to
be
but
so
far
we
have
only
hypothetical
suppositions
or
rather
certainties
which
are
personal
to
myself
we
shall
never
intercept
the
guillotine
with
those
ah
if
we
could
only
find
the
given
the
dudouis
would
act
without
them
he
will
laugh
in
my
face
what
then
murmured
hortense
in
anguished
accents
he
did
not
reply
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
assuming
an
air
of
gaiety
and
rubbing
his
hands
all
was
going
so
well
it
was
really
a
treat
to
take
up
a
case
which
so
to
speak
worked
itself
out
automatically
suppose
we
went
on
to
the
prefecture
morisseau
the
chief
must
be
there
by
now
and
having
gone
so
far
we
may
as
well
finish
will
dutreuil
come
with
us
why
not
said
dutreuil
arrogantly
but
just
as
rénine
was
opening
the
door
there
was
a
noise
in
the
passage
and
the
manager
ran
up
waving
his
arms
is
dutreuil
still
here
dutreuil
your
flat
is
on
fire
a
man
outside
told
us
he
saw
it
from
the
square
the
young
man
eyes
lit
up
for
perhaps
half
a
second
his
mouth
was
twisted
by
a
smile
which
rénine
noticed
oh
you
ruffian
he
cried
you
given
yourself
away
my
beauty
it
was
you
who
set
fire
to
the
place
upstairs
and
now
the
notes
are
burning
he
blocked
his
exit
let
me
pass
shouted
dutreuil
there
a
fire
and
no
one
can
get
in
because
no
one
else
has
a
key
here
it
is
let
me
pass
damn
it
rénine
snatched
the
key
from
his
hand
and
holding
him
by
the
collar
of
his
coat
do
you
move
my
fine
fellow
the
game
up
you
precious
blackguard
morisseau
will
you
give
orders
to
the
sergeant
not
to
let
him
out
of
his
sight
and
to
blow
out
his
brains
if
he
tries
to
get
away
sergeant
we
rely
on
you
put
a
bullet
into
him
if
necessary
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
followed
by
hortense
and
the
chief
inspector
who
was
protesting
rather
peevishly
but
i
say
look
here
it
was
he
who
set
the
place
on
fire
how
do
you
make
out
that
he
set
it
on
fire
seeing
that
he
never
left
us
why
he
set
it
on
fire
beforehand
to
be
sure
how
i
ask
you
how
how
do
i
know
but
a
fire
does
break
out
like
that
for
no
reason
at
all
at
the
very
moment
when
a
man
wants
to
burn
compromising
papers
they
heard
a
commotion
upstairs
it
was
the
waiters
of
the
restaurant
trying
to
burst
the
door
open
an
acrid
smell
filled
the
well
of
the
rénine
reached
the
top
floor
by
your
leave
friends
i
have
the
key
he
inserted
it
in
the
lock
and
opened
the
door
he
was
met
by
a
gust
of
smoke
so
dense
that
one
might
well
have
supposed
the
whole
floor
to
be
ablaze
rénine
at
once
saw
that
the
fire
had
gone
out
of
its
own
accord
for
lack
of
fuel
and
that
there
were
no
more
flames
morisseau
you
wo
let
any
one
come
in
with
us
will
you
an
intruder
might
spoil
everything
bolt
the
door
that
will
be
best
he
stepped
into
the
front
room
where
the
fire
had
obviously
had
its
chief
centre
the
furniture
the
walls
and
the
ceiling
though
blackened
by
the
smoke
had
not
been
touched
as
a
matter
of
fact
the
fire
was
confined
to
a
blaze
of
papers
which
was
still
burning
in
the
middle
of
the
room
in
front
of
the
window
rénine
struck
his
forehead
what
a
fool
i
am
what
an
unspeakable
ass
why
asked
the
inspector
the
of
course
the
cardboard
which
was
standing
on
the
table
that
where
he
hid
the
notes
they
were
there
all
through
our
search
impossible
why
yes
we
always
overlook
that
particular
the
one
just
under
our
eyes
within
reach
of
our
hands
how
could
one
imagine
that
a
thief
would
leave
sixty
thousand
francs
in
an
open
cardboard
box
in
which
he
places
his
hat
when
he
comes
in
with
an
air
that
just
the
one
place
we
do
look
in
well
played
m
dutreuil
the
inspector
who
remained
incredulous
repeated
no
no
impossible
we
were
with
him
and
he
could
not
have
started
the
fire
himself
everything
was
prepared
beforehand
on
the
supposition
that
there
might
be
an
alarm
the
the
tissue
paper
the
they
must
all
have
been
steeped
in
some
inflammable
liquid
he
must
have
thrown
a
match
a
chemical
preparation
or
what
not
into
it
as
we
were
leaving
but
we
should
have
seen
him
hang
it
all
and
then
is
it
credible
that
a
man
who
has
committed
a
murder
for
the
sake
of
sixty
thousand
francs
should
do
away
with
the
money
in
this
way
if
the
was
such
a
good
one
and
it
was
because
we
never
discovered
it
why
this
useless
destruction
he
got
frightened
morisseau
remember
that
his
head
is
at
stake
and
he
knows
it
anything
rather
than
the
guillotine
and
they
the
were
the
only
proof
which
we
had
against
him
how
could
he
have
left
them
where
they
were
morisseau
was
flabbergasted
what
the
only
proof
why
obviously
but
your
witnesses
your
evidence
all
that
you
were
going
to
tell
the
chief
mere
bluff
well
upon
my
word
growled
the
bewildered
inspector
you
a
cool
customer
would
you
have
taken
action
without
my
bluff
no
then
what
more
do
you
want
rénine
stooped
to
stir
the
ashes
but
there
was
nothing
left
not
even
those
remnants
of
stiff
paper
which
still
retain
their
shape
nothing
he
said
it
queer
all
the
same
how
the
deuce
did
he
manage
to
set
the
thing
alight
he
stood
up
looking
attentively
about
him
hortense
had
a
feeling
that
he
was
making
his
supreme
effort
and
that
after
this
last
struggle
in
the
dark
he
would
either
have
devised
his
plan
of
victory
or
admit
that
he
was
beaten
faltering
with
anxiety
she
asked
it
all
up
is
it
no
no
he
said
thoughtfully
it
not
all
up
it
was
a
few
seconds
ago
but
now
there
is
a
gleam
of
light
and
one
that
gives
me
hope
god
grant
that
it
may
be
justified
we
must
go
slowly
he
said
it
is
only
an
attempt
but
a
fine
a
very
fine
attempt
and
it
may
succeed
he
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
with
an
amused
smile
and
a
click
of
the
tongue
he
said
an
infernally
clever
fellow
that
dutreuil
his
trick
of
burning
the
notes
what
a
fertile
imagination
and
what
coolness
a
pretty
dance
the
beggar
has
led
me
he
a
master
he
fetched
a
broom
from
the
kitchen
and
swept
a
part
of
the
ashes
into
the
next
room
returning
with
a
of
the
same
size
and
appearance
as
the
one
which
had
been
burnt
after
crumpling
the
tissue
paper
with
which
it
was
filled
he
placed
the
on
the
little
table
and
set
fire
to
it
with
a
match
it
burst
into
flames
which
he
extinguished
when
they
had
consumed
half
the
cardboard
and
nearly
all
the
paper
then
he
took
from
an
inner
pocket
of
his
waistcoat
a
bundle
of
and
selected
six
which
he
burnt
almost
completely
arranging
the
remains
and
hiding
the
rest
of
the
notes
at
the
bottom
of
the
box
among
the
ashes
and
the
blackened
bits
of
paper
morisseau
he
said
when
he
had
done
i
am
asking
for
your
assistance
for
the
last
time
go
and
fetch
dutreuil
tell
him
just
this
are
unmasked
the
notes
did
not
catch
fire
come
with
me
and
bring
him
up
here
despite
his
hesitation
and
his
fear
of
exceeding
his
instructions
from
the
head
of
the
detective
service
the
was
powerless
to
throw
off
the
ascendancy
which
rénine
had
acquired
over
him
he
left
the
room
rénine
turned
to
hortense
do
you
understand
my
plan
of
battle
yes
she
said
but
it
a
dangerous
experiment
do
you
think
that
dutreuil
will
fall
into
the
trap
everything
depends
on
the
state
of
his
nerves
and
the
degree
of
demoralization
to
which
he
is
reduced
a
surprise
attack
may
very
well
do
for
him
nevertheless
suppose
he
recognizes
by
some
sign
that
the
box
has
been
changed
oh
of
course
he
has
a
few
chances
in
his
favour
the
fellow
is
much
more
cunning
than
i
thought
and
quite
capable
of
wriggling
out
of
the
trap
on
the
other
hand
however
how
uneasy
he
must
be
how
the
blood
must
be
buzzing
in
his
ears
and
obscuring
his
sight
no
i
do
think
that
he
will
avoid
the
trap
he
will
give
in
he
will
give
in
they
exchanged
no
more
words
rénine
did
not
move
hortense
was
stirred
to
the
very
depths
of
her
being
the
life
of
an
innocent
man
hung
trembling
in
the
balance
an
error
of
judgment
a
little
bad
luck
and
twelve
hours
later
jacques
aubrieux
would
be
put
to
death
and
together
with
a
horrible
anguish
she
experienced
in
spite
of
all
a
feeling
of
eager
curiosity
what
was
prince
rénine
going
to
do
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
the
experiment
on
which
he
was
venturing
what
resistance
would
gaston
dutreuil
offer
she
lived
through
one
of
those
minutes
of
superhuman
tension
in
which
life
becomes
intensified
until
it
reaches
its
utmost
value
they
heard
footsteps
on
the
stairs
the
footsteps
of
men
in
a
hurry
the
sound
drew
nearer
they
were
reaching
the
top
floor
hortense
looked
at
her
companion
he
had
stood
up
and
was
listening
his
features
already
transfigured
by
action
the
footsteps
were
now
echoing
in
the
passage
then
suddenly
he
ran
to
the
door
and
cried
quick
let
make
an
end
of
it
two
or
three
detectives
and
a
couple
of
waiters
entered
he
caught
hold
of
dutreuil
in
the
midst
of
the
detectives
and
pulled
him
by
the
arm
gaily
exclaiming
well
done
old
man
that
trick
of
yours
with
the
table
and
the
was
really
splendid
a
masterpiece
on
my
word
only
it
did
come
off
what
do
you
mean
what
the
matter
mumbled
gaston
dutreuil
staggering
what
i
say
the
fire
burnt
only
half
the
and
the
and
though
some
of
the
were
destroyed
like
the
the
others
are
there
at
the
bottom
you
understand
the
notes
the
great
proof
of
the
murder
they
there
where
you
hid
them
as
chance
would
have
it
they
escaped
burning
here
look
there
are
the
numbers
you
can
check
them
oh
you
done
for
done
for
my
beauty
the
young
man
drew
himself
up
stiffly
his
eyelids
quivered
he
did
not
accept
rénine
invitation
to
look
he
examined
neither
the
nor
the
from
the
first
moment
without
taking
the
time
to
reflect
and
before
his
instinct
could
warn
him
he
believed
what
he
was
told
and
collapsed
heavily
into
a
chair
weeping
the
surprise
attack
to
use
rénine
expression
had
succeeded
on
seeing
all
his
plans
baffled
and
the
enemy
master
of
his
secrets
the
wretched
man
had
neither
the
strength
nor
the
perspicacity
necessary
to
defend
himself
he
threw
up
the
sponge
rénine
gave
him
no
time
to
breathe
capital
you
saving
your
head
and
that
all
my
good
youth
write
down
your
confession
and
get
it
off
your
chest
here
a
the
luck
has
been
against
you
i
admit
it
was
devilishly
well
thought
out
your
trick
of
the
last
moment
you
had
the
which
were
in
your
way
and
which
you
wanted
to
destroy
nothing
simpler
you
take
a
big
and
stand
it
on
the
it
acts
as
a
concentrating
the
rays
of
the
sun
on
the
cardboard
and
all
nicely
prepared
ten
minutes
later
it
bursts
into
flames
a
splendid
idea
and
like
all
great
discoveries
it
came
quite
by
chance
what
it
reminds
one
of
newton
apple
one
day
the
sun
passing
through
the
water
in
that
bottle
must
have
set
fire
to
a
scrap
of
cotton
or
the
head
of
a
match
and
as
you
had
the
sun
at
your
disposal
just
now
you
said
to
yourself
the
time
and
stood
the
bottle
in
the
right
position
my
congratulations
gaston
look
here
a
sheet
of
paper
write
down
was
i
who
murdered
m
guillaume
write
i
tell
you
leaning
over
the
young
man
with
all
his
implacable
force
of
will
he
compelled
him
to
write
guiding
his
hand
and
dictating
the
sentences
dutreuil
exhausted
at
the
end
of
his
strength
wrote
as
he
was
told
here
the
confession
said
rénine
you
will
be
good
enough
to
take
it
to
dudouis
these
gentlemen
turning
to
the
waiters
from
the
restaurant
will
i
am
sure
consent
to
serve
as
witnesses
and
seeing
that
dutreuil
overwhelmed
by
what
had
happened
did
not
move
he
gave
him
a
shake
hi
you
look
alive
now
that
you
been
fool
enough
to
confess
make
an
end
of
the
job
my
gentle
idiot
the
other
watched
him
standing
in
front
of
him
obviously
rénine
continued
you
only
a
simpleton
the
was
fairly
burnt
to
ashes
so
were
the
notes
that
my
dear
fellow
is
a
different
one
and
those
notes
belong
to
me
i
even
burnt
six
of
them
to
make
you
swallow
the
stunt
and
you
could
make
out
what
had
happened
what
an
owl
you
must
be
to
furnish
me
with
evidence
at
the
last
moment
when
i
had
a
single
proof
of
my
own
and
such
evidence
a
written
confession
written
before
witnesses
look
here
my
man
if
they
do
cut
off
your
head
as
i
sincerely
hope
they
will
upon
my
word
you
have
jolly
well
deserved
it
dutreuil
downstairs
in
the
street
rénine
asked
hortense
daniel
to
take
the
car
go
to
madeleine
aubrieux
and
tell
her
what
had
happened
and
you
asked
hortense
i
have
a
lot
to
do
urgent
appointments
and
you
deny
yourself
the
pleasure
of
bringing
the
good
news
it
one
of
the
pleasures
that
pall
upon
one
the
only
pleasure
that
never
flags
is
that
of
the
fight
itself
afterwards
things
cease
to
be
interesting
she
took
his
hand
and
for
a
moment
held
it
in
both
her
own
she
would
have
liked
to
express
all
her
admiration
to
that
strange
man
who
seemed
to
do
good
as
a
sort
of
game
and
who
did
it
with
something
like
genius
but
she
was
unable
to
speak
all
these
rapid
incidents
had
upset
her
emotion
constricted
her
throat
and
brought
the
tears
to
her
eyes
rénine
bowed
his
head
saying
thank
you
i
have
my
reward
iii
the
case
of
jean
louis
monsieur
continued
the
young
girl
addressing
serge
rénine
it
was
while
i
was
spending
the
easter
holidays
at
nice
with
my
father
that
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
jean
louis
rénine
interrupted
her
excuse
me
mademoiselle
but
just
now
you
spoke
of
this
young
man
as
jean
louis
vaurois
that
his
name
also
she
said
has
he
two
names
then
i
do
know
i
do
know
anything
about
it
she
said
with
some
embarrassment
and
that
is
why
by
hortense
advice
i
came
to
ask
for
your
help
this
conversation
was
taking
place
in
rénine
flat
on
the
boulevard
haussmann
to
which
hortense
had
brought
her
friend
geneviève
aymard
a
slender
pretty
little
creature
with
a
face
by
an
expression
of
the
greatest
melancholy
rénine
will
be
successful
take
my
word
for
it
geneviève
you
will
rénine
wo
you
please
tell
me
the
rest
of
the
story
mademoiselle
he
said
geneviève
continued
i
was
already
engaged
at
the
time
to
a
man
whom
i
loathe
and
detest
my
father
was
trying
to
force
me
to
marry
him
and
is
still
trying
to
do
so
jean
louis
and
i
felt
the
keenest
sympathy
for
each
other
a
sympathy
that
soon
developed
into
a
profound
and
passionate
affection
which
i
can
assure
you
was
equally
sincere
on
both
sides
on
my
return
to
paris
jean
louis
who
lives
in
the
country
with
his
mother
and
his
aunt
took
rooms
in
our
part
of
the
town
and
as
i
am
allowed
to
go
out
by
myself
we
used
to
see
each
other
daily
i
need
not
tell
you
that
we
were
engaged
to
be
married
i
told
my
father
so
and
this
is
what
he
said
do
particularly
like
the
fellow
but
whether
it
he
or
another
what
i
want
is
that
you
should
get
married
so
let
him
come
and
ask
for
your
hand
if
not
you
must
do
as
i
say
in
the
middle
of
june
jean
louis
went
home
to
arrange
matters
with
his
mother
and
aunt
i
received
some
passionate
letters
and
then
just
these
few
words
are
too
many
obstacles
in
the
way
of
our
happiness
i
give
up
i
am
mad
with
despair
i
love
you
more
than
ever
and
forgive
me
since
then
i
have
received
nothing
no
reply
to
my
letters
and
telegrams
perhaps
he
has
fallen
in
love
with
somebody
else
asked
rénine
or
there
may
be
some
old
connection
which
he
is
unable
to
shake
off
geneviève
shook
her
head
monsieur
believe
me
if
our
engagement
had
been
broken
off
for
an
ordinary
reason
i
should
not
have
allowed
hortense
to
trouble
you
but
it
is
something
quite
different
i
am
absolutely
convinced
there
a
mystery
in
jean
louis
life
or
rather
an
endless
number
of
mysteries
which
hamper
and
pursue
him
i
never
saw
such
distress
in
a
human
face
and
from
the
first
moment
of
our
meeting
i
was
conscious
in
him
of
a
grief
and
melancholy
which
have
always
persisted
even
at
times
when
he
was
giving
himself
to
our
love
with
the
greatest
confidence
but
your
impression
must
have
been
confirmed
by
minor
details
by
things
which
happened
to
strike
you
as
peculiar
i
do
quite
know
what
to
say
these
two
names
for
instance
yes
there
was
certainly
that
by
what
name
did
he
introduce
himself
to
you
jean
louis
but
jean
louis
vaurois
that
what
my
father
calls
him
why
because
that
was
how
he
was
introduced
to
my
father
at
nice
by
a
gentleman
who
knew
him
besides
he
carries
which
describe
him
under
either
name
have
you
never
questioned
him
on
this
point
yes
i
have
twice
the
first
time
he
said
that
his
aunt
name
was
vaurois
and
his
mother
and
the
second
time
he
told
me
the
contrary
he
spoke
of
his
mother
as
vaurois
and
of
his
aunt
as
i
pointed
this
out
he
coloured
up
and
i
thought
it
better
not
to
question
him
any
further
does
he
live
far
from
paris
right
down
in
brittany
at
the
manoir
five
miles
from
carhaix
rénine
rose
and
asked
the
girl
seriously
are
you
quite
certain
that
he
loves
you
mademoiselle
i
am
certain
of
it
and
i
know
too
that
he
represents
all
my
life
and
all
my
happiness
he
alone
can
save
me
if
he
ca
then
i
shall
be
married
in
a
week
time
to
a
man
whom
i
hate
i
have
promised
my
father
and
the
banns
have
been
published
we
shall
leave
for
carhaix
madame
daniel
and
i
this
evening
said
rénine
that
evening
he
and
hortense
took
the
train
for
brittany
they
reached
carhaix
at
ten
in
the
morning
and
after
lunch
at
half
past
twelve
they
stepped
into
a
car
borrowed
from
a
leading
resident
of
the
district
you
looking
a
little
pale
my
dear
said
rénine
with
a
laugh
as
they
alighted
by
the
gate
of
the
garden
at
elseven
i
very
fond
of
geneviève
she
said
she
the
only
friend
i
have
and
i
feeling
frightened
he
called
her
attention
to
the
fact
that
the
central
gate
was
flanked
by
two
wickets
bearing
the
names
of
madame
and
madame
vaurois
respectively
each
of
these
wickets
opened
on
a
narrow
path
which
ran
among
the
shrubberies
of
box
and
aucuba
to
the
left
and
right
of
the
main
avenue
the
avenue
itself
led
to
an
old
long
low
and
picturesque
but
provided
with
two
ugly
wings
each
in
a
different
style
of
architecture
and
each
forming
the
destination
of
one
of
the
madame
evidently
lived
on
the
left
and
madame
vaurois
on
the
right
hortense
and
rénine
listened
shrill
hasty
voices
were
disputing
inside
the
house
the
sound
came
through
one
of
the
windows
of
the
which
was
level
with
the
garden
and
covered
throughout
its
length
with
red
creepers
and
white
roses
we
ca
go
any
farther
said
hortense
it
would
be
indiscreet
all
the
more
reason
whispered
rénine
look
here
if
we
walk
straight
ahead
we
sha
be
seen
by
the
people
who
are
quarrelling
the
sounds
of
conflict
were
by
no
means
abating
and
when
they
reached
the
window
next
to
the
through
the
roses
and
creepers
they
could
both
see
and
hear
two
old
ladies
shrieking
at
the
tops
of
their
voices
and
shaking
their
fists
at
each
other
the
women
were
standing
in
the
foreground
in
a
large
where
the
table
was
not
yet
cleared
and
at
the
farther
side
of
the
table
sat
a
young
man
doubtless
jean
louis
himself
smoking
his
pipe
and
reading
a
newspaper
without
appearing
to
trouble
about
the
two
old
harridans
one
of
these
a
thin
tall
woman
was
wearing
a
purple
silk
dress
and
her
hair
was
dressed
in
a
mass
of
curls
much
too
yellow
for
the
ravaged
face
around
which
they
tumbled
the
other
who
was
still
thinner
but
quite
short
was
bustling
round
the
room
in
a
cotton
and
displayed
a
red
painted
face
blazing
with
anger
a
baggage
that
what
you
are
she
yelped
the
wickedest
woman
in
the
world
and
a
thief
into
the
bargain
i
a
thief
screamed
the
other
what
about
that
business
with
the
ducks
at
ten
francs
apiece
do
you
call
that
thieving
hold
your
tongue
you
low
creature
who
stole
the
note
from
my
lord
that
i
should
have
to
live
with
such
a
wretch
the
other
started
with
fury
at
the
outrage
and
addressing
the
young
man
cried
jean
are
you
going
to
sit
there
and
let
me
be
insulted
by
your
hussy
of
a
and
the
tall
one
retorted
furiously
hussy
do
you
hear
that
louis
look
at
her
your
vaurois
she
got
the
airs
of
a
superannuated
barmaid
make
her
stop
ca
you
suddenly
jean
louis
banged
his
fist
upon
the
table
making
the
plates
and
dishes
jump
and
shouted
be
quiet
both
of
you
you
old
lunatics
they
turned
upon
him
at
once
and
loaded
him
with
abuse
coward
hypocrite
liar
a
pretty
sort
of
son
you
are
the
son
of
a
slut
and
not
much
better
yourself
the
insults
rained
down
upon
him
he
stopped
his
ears
with
his
fingers
and
writhed
as
he
sat
at
table
like
a
man
who
has
lost
all
patience
and
has
need
to
restrain
himself
lest
he
should
fall
upon
his
enemy
rénine
whispered
now
the
time
to
go
in
in
among
all
those
infuriated
people
protested
hortense
exactly
we
shall
see
them
better
with
their
masks
off
and
with
a
determined
step
he
walked
to
the
door
opened
it
and
entered
the
room
followed
by
hortense
his
advent
gave
rise
to
a
feeling
of
stupefaction
the
two
women
stopped
yelling
but
were
still
scarlet
in
the
face
and
trembling
with
rage
jean
louis
who
was
very
pale
stood
up
profiting
by
the
general
confusion
rénine
said
briskly
allow
me
to
introduce
myself
i
am
prince
rénine
this
is
madame
daniel
we
are
friends
of
mlle
geneviève
aymard
and
we
have
come
in
her
name
i
have
a
letter
from
her
addressed
to
you
monsieur
jean
louis
already
disconcerted
by
the
newcomers
arrival
lost
countenance
entirely
on
hearing
the
name
of
geneviève
without
quite
knowing
what
he
was
saying
and
with
the
intention
of
responding
to
courteous
behaviour
he
tried
in
his
turn
to
introduce
the
two
ladies
and
let
fall
the
astounding
words
my
mother
madame
my
mother
madame
vaurois
for
some
time
no
one
spoke
rénine
bowed
hortense
did
not
know
with
whom
she
should
shake
hands
with
madame
the
mother
or
with
madame
vaurois
the
mother
but
what
happened
was
that
madame
and
madame
vaurois
both
at
the
same
time
attempted
to
snatch
the
letter
which
rénine
was
holding
out
to
jean
louis
while
both
at
the
same
time
mumbled
mlle
aymard
she
has
had
the
coolness
she
has
had
the
audacity
then
jean
louis
recovering
his
laid
hold
of
his
mother
and
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
by
a
door
on
the
left
and
next
of
his
mother
vaurois
and
pushed
her
out
of
the
room
by
a
door
on
the
right
then
returning
to
his
two
visitors
he
opened
the
envelope
and
read
in
an
undertone
i
am
to
be
married
in
a
week
jean
louis
come
to
my
rescue
i
beseech
you
my
friend
hortense
and
prince
rénine
will
help
you
to
overcome
the
obstacles
that
baffle
you
trust
them
i
love
you
geneviève
he
was
a
rather
young
man
whose
very
swarthy
lean
and
bony
face
certainly
bore
the
expression
of
melancholy
and
distress
described
by
geneviève
indeed
the
marks
of
suffering
were
visible
in
all
his
harassed
features
as
well
as
in
his
sad
and
anxious
eyes
he
repeated
geneviève
name
over
and
over
again
while
looking
about
him
with
a
distracted
air
he
seemed
to
be
seeking
a
course
of
conduct
he
seemed
on
the
point
of
offering
an
explanation
but
could
find
nothing
to
say
the
sudden
intervention
had
taken
him
at
a
disadvantage
like
an
unforseen
attack
which
he
did
not
know
how
to
meet
rénine
felt
that
the
adversary
would
capitulate
at
the
first
summons
the
man
had
been
fighting
so
desperately
during
the
last
few
months
and
had
suffered
so
severely
in
the
retirement
and
obstinate
silence
in
which
he
had
taken
refuge
that
he
was
not
thinking
of
defending
himself
moreover
how
could
he
do
so
now
that
they
had
forced
their
way
into
the
privacy
of
his
odious
existence
take
my
word
for
it
monsieur
declared
rénine
that
it
is
in
your
best
interests
to
confide
in
us
we
are
geneviève
aymard
friends
do
not
hesitate
to
speak
i
can
hardly
hesitate
he
said
after
what
you
have
just
heard
this
is
the
life
i
lead
monsieur
i
will
tell
you
the
whole
secret
so
that
you
may
tell
it
to
geneviève
she
will
then
understand
why
i
have
not
gone
back
to
her
and
why
i
have
not
the
right
to
do
so
he
pushed
a
chair
forward
for
hortense
the
two
men
sat
down
and
without
any
need
of
further
persuasion
rather
as
though
he
himself
felt
a
certain
relief
in
unburdening
himself
he
said
you
must
not
be
surprised
monsieur
if
i
tell
my
story
with
a
certain
flippancy
for
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
is
a
frankly
comical
story
and
can
not
fail
to
make
you
laugh
fate
often
amuses
itself
by
playing
these
imbecile
tricks
these
monstrous
farces
which
seem
as
though
they
must
have
been
invented
by
the
brain
of
a
madman
or
a
drunkard
judge
for
yourself
years
ago
the
manoir
which
at
that
time
consisted
only
of
the
main
building
was
occupied
by
an
old
doctor
who
to
increase
his
modest
means
used
to
receive
one
or
two
paying
guests
in
this
way
madame
spent
the
summer
here
one
year
and
madame
vaurois
the
following
summer
now
these
two
ladies
did
not
know
each
other
one
of
them
was
married
to
a
breton
of
a
and
the
other
to
a
commercial
traveller
from
the
vendée
it
so
happened
that
they
lost
their
husbands
at
the
same
time
at
a
period
when
each
of
them
was
expecting
a
baby
and
as
they
both
lived
in
the
country
at
places
some
distance
from
any
town
they
wrote
to
the
old
doctor
that
they
intended
to
come
to
his
house
for
their
confinement
he
agreed
they
arrived
almost
on
the
same
day
in
the
autumn
two
small
bedrooms
were
prepared
for
them
behind
the
room
in
which
we
are
sitting
the
doctor
had
engaged
a
nurse
who
slept
in
this
very
room
everything
was
perfectly
satisfactory
the
ladies
were
putting
the
finishing
touches
to
their
and
were
getting
on
together
splendidly
they
were
determined
that
their
children
should
be
boys
and
had
chosen
the
names
of
jean
and
louis
respectively
one
evening
the
doctor
was
called
out
to
a
case
and
drove
off
in
his
gig
with
the
saying
that
he
would
not
be
back
till
next
day
in
her
master
absence
a
little
girl
who
served
as
ran
out
to
keep
company
with
her
sweetheart
these
accidents
destiny
turned
to
account
with
diabolical
malignity
at
about
midnight
madame
was
seized
with
the
first
pains
the
nurse
mlle
boussignol
had
had
some
training
as
a
midwife
and
did
not
lose
her
head
but
an
hour
later
madame
vaurois
turn
came
and
the
tragedy
or
i
might
rather
say
the
was
enacted
amid
the
screams
and
moans
of
the
two
patients
and
the
bewildered
agitation
of
the
nurse
running
from
one
to
the
other
bewailing
her
fate
opening
the
window
to
call
out
for
the
doctor
or
falling
on
her
knees
to
implore
the
aid
of
providence
madame
vaurois
was
the
first
to
bring
a
son
into
the
world
mlle
boussignol
hurriedly
carried
him
in
here
washed
and
tended
him
and
laid
him
in
the
cradle
prepared
for
him
but
madame
was
screaming
with
pain
and
the
nurse
had
to
attend
to
her
while
the
newborn
child
was
yelling
like
a
stuck
pig
and
the
terrified
mother
unable
to
stir
from
her
bed
fainted
add
to
this
all
the
wretchedness
of
darkness
and
disorder
the
only
lamp
without
any
oil
for
the
servant
had
neglected
to
fill
it
the
candles
burning
out
the
moaning
of
the
wind
the
screeching
of
the
owls
and
you
will
understand
that
mlle
boussignol
was
scared
out
of
her
wits
however
at
five
in
the
morning
after
many
tragic
incidents
she
came
in
here
with
the
baby
likewise
a
boy
washed
and
tended
him
laid
him
in
his
cradle
and
went
off
to
help
madame
vaurois
who
had
come
to
herself
and
was
crying
out
while
madame
had
fainted
in
her
turn
and
when
mlle
boussignol
having
settled
the
two
mothers
but
with
fatigue
her
brain
in
a
whirl
returned
to
the
children
she
realized
with
horror
that
she
had
wrapped
them
in
similar
binders
thrust
their
feet
into
similar
woolen
socks
and
laid
them
both
side
by
side
the
same
so
that
it
was
impossible
to
tell
louis
from
jean
vaurois
to
make
matters
worse
when
she
lifted
one
of
them
out
of
the
cradle
she
found
that
his
hands
were
cold
as
ice
and
that
he
had
ceased
to
breathe
he
was
dead
what
was
his
name
and
what
the
survivor
three
hours
later
the
doctor
found
the
two
women
in
a
condition
of
frenzied
delirium
while
the
nurse
was
dragging
herself
from
one
bed
to
the
other
entreating
the
two
mothers
to
forgive
her
she
held
me
out
first
to
one
then
to
the
other
to
receive
their
caresses
for
i
was
the
surviving
child
and
they
first
kissed
me
and
then
pushed
me
away
for
after
all
who
was
i
the
son
of
the
widowed
madame
and
the
late
or
the
son
of
the
widowed
madame
vaurois
and
the
late
commercial
traveller
there
was
not
a
clue
by
which
they
could
tell
the
doctor
begged
each
of
the
two
mothers
to
sacrifice
her
rights
at
least
from
the
legal
point
of
view
so
that
i
might
be
called
either
louis
or
jean
vaurois
they
refused
absolutely
jean
vaurois
if
he
a
protested
the
one
louis
if
he
a
vaurois
retorted
the
other
and
i
was
registered
under
the
name
of
jean
louis
the
son
of
an
unknown
father
and
mother
prince
rénine
had
listened
in
silence
but
hortense
as
the
story
approached
its
conclusion
had
given
way
to
a
hilarity
which
she
could
no
longer
restrain
and
suddenly
in
spite
of
all
her
efforts
she
burst
into
a
fit
of
the
wildest
laughter
forgive
me
she
said
her
eyes
filled
with
tears
do
forgive
me
too
much
for
my
nerves
do
apologize
madame
said
the
young
man
gently
in
a
voice
free
from
resentment
i
warned
you
that
my
story
was
laughable
i
better
than
any
one
know
how
absurd
how
nonsensical
it
is
yes
the
whole
thing
is
perfectly
grotesque
but
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
it
was
no
fun
in
reality
it
seems
a
humorous
situation
and
it
remains
humorous
by
the
force
of
circumstances
but
it
is
also
horrible
you
can
see
that
for
yourself
ca
you
the
two
mothers
neither
of
whom
was
certain
of
being
a
mother
but
neither
of
whom
was
certain
that
she
was
not
one
both
clung
to
jean
louis
he
might
be
a
stranger
on
the
other
hand
he
might
be
their
own
flesh
and
blood
they
loved
him
to
excess
and
fought
for
him
furiously
and
above
all
they
both
came
to
hate
each
other
with
a
deadly
hatred
differing
completely
in
character
and
education
and
obliged
to
live
together
because
neither
was
willing
to
forego
the
advantage
of
her
possible
maternity
they
lived
the
life
of
irreconcilable
enemies
who
can
never
lay
their
weapons
aside
i
grew
up
in
the
midst
of
this
hatred
and
had
it
instilled
into
me
by
both
of
them
when
my
childish
heart
hungering
for
affection
inclined
me
to
one
of
them
the
other
would
seek
to
inspire
me
with
loathing
and
contempt
for
her
in
this
which
they
bought
on
the
old
doctor
death
and
to
which
they
added
the
two
wings
i
was
the
involuntary
torturer
and
their
daily
victim
tormented
as
a
child
and
as
a
young
man
leading
the
most
hideous
of
lives
i
doubt
if
any
one
on
earth
ever
suffered
more
than
i
did
you
ought
to
have
left
them
exclaimed
hortense
who
had
stopped
laughing
one
ca
leave
one
mother
and
one
of
those
two
women
was
my
mother
and
a
woman
ca
abandon
her
son
and
each
of
them
was
entitled
to
believe
that
i
was
her
son
we
were
all
three
chained
together
like
convicts
with
chains
of
sorrow
compassion
doubt
and
also
of
hope
that
the
truth
might
one
day
become
apparent
and
here
we
still
are
all
three
insulting
one
another
and
blaming
one
another
for
our
wasted
lives
oh
what
a
hell
and
there
was
no
escaping
it
i
tried
often
enough
but
in
vain
the
broken
bonds
became
tied
again
only
this
summer
under
the
stimulus
of
my
love
for
geneviève
i
tried
to
free
myself
and
did
my
utmost
to
persuade
the
two
women
whom
i
call
mother
and
then
and
then
i
was
up
against
their
complaints
their
immediate
hatred
of
the
wife
of
the
stranger
whom
i
was
proposing
to
force
upon
them
i
gave
way
what
sort
of
a
life
would
geneviève
have
had
here
between
madame
and
madame
vaurois
i
had
no
right
to
victimize
her
jean
louis
who
had
been
gradually
becoming
excited
uttered
these
last
words
in
a
firm
voice
as
though
he
would
have
wished
his
conduct
to
be
ascribed
to
conscientious
motives
and
a
sense
of
duty
in
reality
as
rénine
and
hortense
clearly
saw
his
was
an
unusually
weak
nature
incapable
of
reacting
against
a
ridiculous
position
from
which
he
had
suffered
ever
since
he
was
a
child
and
which
he
had
come
to
look
upon
as
final
and
irremediable
he
endured
it
as
a
man
bears
a
cross
which
he
has
no
right
to
cast
aside
and
at
the
same
time
he
was
ashamed
of
it
he
had
never
spoken
of
it
to
geneviève
from
dread
of
ridicule
and
afterwards
on
returning
to
his
prison
he
had
remained
there
out
of
habit
and
weakness
he
sat
down
to
a
and
quickly
wrote
a
letter
which
he
handed
to
rénine
would
you
be
kind
enough
to
give
this
note
to
mlle
aymard
and
beg
her
once
more
to
forgive
me
rénine
did
not
move
and
when
the
other
pressed
the
letter
upon
him
he
took
it
and
tore
it
up
what
does
this
mean
asked
the
young
man
it
means
that
i
will
not
charge
myself
with
any
message
why
because
you
are
coming
with
us
i
yes
you
will
see
mlle
aymard
and
ask
for
her
hand
in
marriage
jean
louis
looked
at
rénine
with
a
rather
disdainful
air
as
though
he
were
thinking
here
a
man
who
has
not
understood
a
word
of
what
i
been
explaining
to
him
but
hortense
went
up
to
rénine
why
do
you
say
that
because
it
will
be
as
i
say
but
you
must
have
your
reasons
one
only
but
it
will
be
enough
provided
this
gentleman
is
so
kind
as
to
help
me
in
my
enquiries
enquiries
with
what
object
asked
the
young
man
with
the
object
of
proving
that
your
story
is
not
quite
accurate
jean
louis
took
umbrage
at
this
i
must
ask
you
to
believe
monsieur
that
i
have
not
said
a
word
which
is
not
the
exact
truth
i
expressed
myself
badly
said
rénine
with
great
kindliness
certainly
you
have
not
said
a
word
that
does
not
agree
with
what
you
believe
to
be
the
exact
truth
but
the
truth
is
not
can
not
be
what
you
believe
it
to
be
the
young
man
folded
his
arms
in
any
case
monsieur
it
seems
likely
that
i
should
know
the
truth
better
than
you
do
why
better
what
happened
on
that
tragic
night
can
obviously
be
known
to
you
only
at
secondhand
you
have
no
proofs
neither
have
madame
and
madame
vaurois
no
proofs
of
what
exclaimed
jean
louis
losing
patience
no
proofs
of
the
confusion
that
took
place
what
why
it
an
absolute
certainty
the
two
children
were
laid
in
the
same
cradle
with
no
marks
to
distinguish
one
from
the
other
and
the
nurse
was
unable
to
tell
at
least
that
her
version
of
it
interrupted
rénine
what
that
her
version
but
you
accusing
the
woman
i
accusing
her
of
nothing
yes
you
are
you
accusing
her
of
lying
and
why
should
she
lie
she
had
no
interest
in
doing
so
and
her
tears
and
despair
are
so
much
evidence
of
her
good
faith
for
after
all
the
two
mothers
were
there
they
saw
the
woman
weeping
they
questioned
her
and
then
i
repeat
what
interest
had
she
jean
louis
was
greatly
excited
close
beside
him
madame
and
madame
vaurois
who
had
no
doubt
been
listening
behind
the
doors
and
who
had
stealthily
entered
the
room
stood
stammering
in
amazement
no
no
it
impossible
we
questioned
her
over
and
over
again
why
should
she
tell
a
lie
speak
monsieur
speak
jean
louis
enjoined
explain
yourself
give
your
reasons
for
trying
to
cast
doubt
upon
an
absolute
truth
because
that
truth
is
inadmissible
declared
rénine
raising
his
voice
and
growing
excited
in
turn
to
the
point
of
punctuating
his
remarks
by
thumping
the
table
no
things
do
happen
like
that
no
fate
does
not
display
those
refinements
of
cruelty
and
chance
is
not
added
to
chance
with
such
reckless
extravagance
it
was
already
an
unprecedented
chance
that
on
the
very
night
on
which
the
doctor
his
and
his
maid
were
out
of
the
house
the
two
ladies
should
be
seized
with
at
the
same
hour
and
should
bring
two
sons
into
the
world
at
the
same
time
do
let
us
add
a
still
more
exceptional
event
enough
of
the
uncanny
enough
of
lamps
that
go
out
and
candles
that
refuse
to
burn
no
and
again
no
it
is
not
admissable
that
a
midwife
should
become
confused
in
the
essential
details
of
her
trade
however
bewildered
she
may
be
by
the
unforeseen
nature
of
the
circumstances
a
remnant
of
instinct
is
still
on
the
alert
so
that
there
is
a
place
prepared
for
each
child
and
each
is
kept
distinct
from
the
other
the
first
child
is
here
the
second
is
there
even
if
they
are
lying
side
by
side
one
is
on
the
left
and
the
other
on
the
right
even
if
they
are
wrapped
in
the
same
kind
of
binders
some
little
detail
differs
a
trifle
which
is
recorded
by
the
memory
and
which
is
inevitably
recalled
to
the
mind
without
any
need
of
reflection
confusion
i
refuse
to
believe
in
it
impossible
to
tell
one
from
the
other
it
is
true
in
the
world
of
fiction
yes
one
can
imagine
all
sorts
of
fantastic
accidents
and
heap
contradiction
on
contradiction
but
in
the
world
of
reality
at
the
very
heart
of
reality
there
is
always
a
fixed
point
a
solid
nucleus
about
which
the
facts
group
themselves
in
accordance
with
a
logical
order
i
therefore
declare
most
positively
that
nurse
boussignol
could
not
have
mixed
up
the
two
children
all
this
he
said
decisively
as
though
he
had
been
present
during
the
night
in
question
and
so
great
was
his
power
of
persuasion
that
from
the
very
first
he
shook
the
certainty
of
those
who
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
a
century
had
never
doubted
the
two
women
and
their
son
pressed
round
him
and
questioned
him
with
breathless
anxiety
then
you
think
that
she
may
know
that
she
may
be
able
to
tell
us
he
corrected
himself
i
do
say
yes
and
i
do
say
no
all
i
say
is
that
there
was
something
in
her
behaviour
during
those
hours
that
does
not
tally
with
her
statements
and
with
reality
all
the
vast
and
intolerable
mystery
that
has
weighed
down
upon
you
three
arises
not
from
a
momentary
lack
of
attention
but
from
something
of
which
we
do
not
know
but
of
which
she
does
that
is
what
i
maintain
and
that
is
what
happened
jean
louis
said
in
a
husky
voice
she
is
alive
she
lives
at
carhaix
we
can
send
for
her
hortense
at
once
proposed
would
you
like
me
to
go
for
her
i
will
take
the
motor
and
bring
her
back
with
me
where
does
she
live
in
the
middle
of
the
town
at
a
little
draper
shop
the
chauffeur
will
show
you
mlle
boussignol
everybody
knows
her
and
whatever
you
do
added
rénine
do
warn
her
in
any
way
if
uneasy
so
much
the
better
but
do
let
her
know
what
we
want
with
her
twenty
minutes
passed
in
absolute
silence
rénine
paced
the
room
in
which
the
fine
old
furniture
the
handsome
tapestries
the
books
and
pretty
denoted
a
love
of
art
and
a
seeking
after
style
in
jean
louis
this
room
was
really
his
in
the
adjoining
apartments
on
either
side
through
the
open
doors
rénine
was
able
to
note
the
bad
taste
of
the
two
mothers
he
went
up
to
jean
louis
and
in
a
low
voice
asked
are
they
well
off
yes
and
you
they
settled
the
upon
me
with
all
the
land
around
it
which
makes
me
quite
independent
have
they
any
relations
sisters
both
of
them
with
whom
they
could
go
to
live
yes
and
they
have
sometimes
thought
of
doing
so
but
there
ca
be
any
question
of
that
once
more
i
assure
you
meantime
the
car
had
returned
the
two
women
jumped
up
hurriedly
ready
to
speak
leave
it
to
me
said
rénine
and
do
be
surprised
by
anything
that
i
say
it
not
a
matter
of
asking
her
questions
but
of
frightening
her
of
flurrying
her
the
sudden
attack
he
added
between
his
teeth
the
car
drove
round
the
lawn
and
drew
up
outside
the
windows
hortense
sprang
out
and
helped
an
old
woman
to
alight
dressed
in
a
fluted
linen
cap
a
black
velvet
bodice
and
a
heavy
gathered
skirt
the
old
woman
entered
in
a
great
state
of
alarm
she
had
a
pointed
face
like
a
weasel
with
a
prominent
mouth
full
of
protruding
teeth
what
the
matter
madame
she
asked
timidly
stepping
into
the
room
from
which
the
doctor
had
once
driven
her
good
day
to
you
madame
vaurois
the
ladies
did
not
reply
rénine
came
forward
and
said
sternly
mlle
boussignol
i
have
been
sent
by
the
paris
police
to
throw
light
upon
a
tragedy
which
took
place
here
years
ago
i
have
just
secured
evidence
that
you
have
distorted
the
truth
and
that
as
the
result
of
your
false
declarations
the
of
one
of
the
children
born
in
the
course
of
that
night
is
inaccurate
now
false
declarations
in
matters
of
are
misdemeanours
punishable
by
law
i
shall
therefore
be
obliged
to
take
you
to
paris
to
be
interrogated
unless
you
are
prepared
here
and
now
to
confess
everything
that
might
repair
the
consequences
of
your
offence
the
old
maid
was
shaking
in
every
limb
her
teeth
were
chattering
she
was
evidently
incapable
of
opposing
the
least
resistance
to
rénine
are
you
ready
to
confess
everything
he
asked
yes
she
panted
without
delay
i
have
to
catch
a
train
the
business
must
be
settled
immediately
if
you
show
the
least
hesitation
i
take
you
with
me
have
you
made
up
your
mind
to
speak
yes
he
pointed
to
jean
louis
whose
son
is
this
gentleman
madame
no
madame
vaurois
therefore
no
a
stupefied
silence
welcomed
the
two
replies
explain
yourself
rénine
commanded
looking
at
his
watch
then
madame
boussignol
fell
on
her
knees
and
said
in
so
low
and
dull
a
voice
that
they
had
to
bend
over
her
in
order
to
catch
the
sense
of
what
she
was
mumbling
some
one
came
in
the
evening
a
gentleman
with
a
baby
wrapped
in
blankets
which
he
wanted
the
doctor
to
look
after
as
the
doctor
there
he
waited
all
night
and
it
was
he
who
did
it
all
did
what
asked
rénine
what
did
he
do
what
happened
well
what
happened
was
that
it
was
not
one
child
but
the
two
of
them
that
died
madame
and
madame
vaurois
too
both
in
convulsions
then
the
gentleman
seeing
this
said
shows
me
where
my
duty
lies
i
must
seize
this
opportunity
of
making
sure
that
my
own
boy
shall
be
happy
and
well
cared
for
put
him
in
the
place
of
one
of
the
dead
children
he
offered
me
a
big
sum
of
money
saying
that
this
one
payment
would
save
him
the
expense
of
providing
for
his
child
every
month
and
i
accepted
only
i
did
not
know
in
whose
place
to
put
him
and
whether
to
say
that
the
boy
was
louis
or
jean
vaurois
the
gentleman
thought
a
moment
and
said
neither
then
he
explained
to
me
what
i
was
to
do
and
what
i
was
to
say
after
he
had
gone
and
while
i
was
dressing
his
boy
in
vest
and
binders
the
same
as
one
of
the
dead
children
he
wrapped
the
other
in
the
blankets
he
had
brought
with
him
and
went
out
into
the
night
mlle
boussignol
bent
her
head
and
wept
after
a
moment
rénine
said
your
deposition
agrees
with
the
result
of
my
investigations
can
i
go
yes
and
is
it
over
as
far
as
i
concerned
they
wo
be
talking
about
this
all
over
the
district
no
oh
just
one
more
question
do
you
know
the
man
name
no
he
did
tell
me
his
name
have
you
ever
seen
him
since
never
have
you
anything
more
to
say
no
are
you
prepared
to
sign
the
written
text
of
your
confession
yes
very
well
i
shall
send
for
you
in
a
week
or
two
till
then
not
a
word
to
anybody
he
saw
her
to
the
door
and
closed
it
after
her
when
he
returned
jean
louis
was
between
the
two
old
ladies
and
all
three
were
holding
hands
the
bond
of
hatred
and
wretchedness
which
had
bound
them
had
suddenly
snapped
and
this
rupture
without
requiring
them
to
reflect
upon
the
matter
filled
them
with
a
gentle
tranquillity
of
which
they
were
hardly
conscious
but
which
made
them
serious
and
thoughtful
let
rush
things
said
rénine
to
hortense
this
is
the
decisive
moment
of
the
battle
we
must
get
jean
louis
on
board
hortense
seemed
preoccupied
she
whispered
why
did
you
let
the
woman
go
were
you
satisfied
with
her
statement
i
do
need
to
be
satisfied
she
told
us
what
happened
what
more
do
you
want
nothing
i
do
know
we
talk
about
it
later
my
dear
for
the
moment
i
repeat
we
must
get
jean
louis
on
board
and
immediately
otherwise
he
turned
to
the
young
man
you
agree
with
me
do
you
that
things
being
as
they
are
it
is
best
for
you
and
madame
vaurois
and
madame
to
separate
for
a
time
that
will
enable
you
all
to
see
matters
more
clearly
and
to
decide
in
perfect
freedom
what
is
to
be
done
come
with
us
monsieur
the
most
pressing
thing
is
to
save
geneviève
aymard
your
jean
louis
stood
perplexed
and
undecided
rénine
turned
to
the
two
women
that
is
your
opinion
too
i
am
sure
ladies
they
nodded
you
see
monsieur
he
said
to
jean
louis
we
are
all
agreed
in
great
crises
there
is
nothing
like
separation
a
few
days
respite
quickly
now
monsieur
and
without
giving
him
time
to
hesitate
he
drove
him
towards
his
bedroom
to
pack
up
half
an
hour
later
jean
louis
left
the
with
his
new
friends
and
he
wo
go
back
until
he
married
said
rénine
to
hortense
as
they
were
waiting
at
carhaix
station
to
which
the
car
had
taken
them
while
jean
louis
was
attending
to
his
luggage
everything
for
the
best
are
you
satisfied
yes
geneviève
will
be
glad
she
replied
absently
when
they
had
taken
their
seats
in
the
train
rénine
and
she
repaired
to
the
rénine
who
had
asked
hortense
several
questions
to
which
she
had
replied
only
in
monosyllables
protested
what
the
matter
with
you
my
child
you
look
worried
i
not
at
all
yes
yes
i
know
you
now
no
secrets
no
mysteries
she
smiled
well
since
you
insist
on
knowing
if
i
am
satisfied
i
am
bound
to
admit
that
of
course
i
am
as
regards
my
friend
geneviève
but
that
in
another
respect
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
adventure
i
have
an
uncomfortable
sort
of
feeling
to
speak
frankly
i
have
you
this
time
not
very
much
i
seem
to
you
to
have
played
a
secondary
part
for
after
all
what
have
i
done
we
arrived
we
listened
to
jean
louis
tale
of
woe
i
had
a
midwife
fetched
and
that
was
all
exactly
i
want
to
know
if
that
all
and
i
not
quite
sure
to
tell
you
the
truth
our
other
adventures
left
behind
them
an
impression
which
was
how
shall
i
put
it
more
definite
clearer
and
this
one
strikes
you
as
obscure
obscure
yes
and
incomplete
but
in
what
way
i
do
know
perhaps
it
has
something
to
do
with
that
woman
confession
yes
very
likely
that
is
it
it
was
all
so
unexpected
and
so
short
well
of
course
i
cut
it
short
as
you
can
readily
imagine
said
rénine
laughing
we
did
want
too
many
explanations
what
do
you
mean
why
if
she
had
given
her
explanations
with
too
much
detail
we
should
have
ended
by
doubting
what
she
was
telling
us
by
doubting
it
well
hang
it
all
the
story
is
a
trifle
that
fellow
arriving
at
night
with
a
live
baby
in
his
pocket
and
going
away
with
a
dead
one
the
thing
hardly
holds
water
but
you
see
my
dear
i
had
much
time
to
coach
the
unfortunate
woman
in
her
part
hortense
stared
at
him
in
amazement
what
on
earth
do
you
mean
well
you
know
how
these
countrywomen
are
and
she
and
i
had
no
time
to
spare
so
we
worked
out
a
little
scene
in
a
hurry
and
she
really
did
act
it
so
badly
it
was
all
in
the
right
key
terror
tears
is
it
possible
murmured
hortense
is
it
possible
you
had
seen
her
beforehand
i
had
to
of
course
but
when
this
morning
when
we
arrived
while
you
were
titivating
yourself
at
the
hotel
at
carhaix
i
was
running
round
to
see
what
information
i
could
pick
up
as
you
may
imagine
everybody
in
the
district
knows
the
story
i
was
at
once
directed
to
the
former
midwife
mlle
boussignol
with
mlle
boussignol
it
did
not
take
long
three
minutes
to
settle
a
new
version
of
what
had
happened
and
ten
thousand
francs
to
induce
her
to
repeat
that
more
or
less
credible
version
to
the
people
at
the
a
quite
incredible
version
not
so
bad
as
all
that
my
child
seeing
that
you
believed
it
and
the
others
too
and
that
was
the
essential
thing
what
i
had
to
do
was
to
demolish
at
one
blow
a
truth
which
had
been
years
in
existence
and
which
was
all
the
more
firmly
established
because
it
was
founded
on
actual
facts
that
was
why
i
went
for
it
with
all
my
might
and
attacked
it
by
sheer
force
of
eloquence
impossible
to
identify
the
children
i
deny
it
inevitable
confusion
it
not
true
all
three
i
say
victims
of
something
which
i
do
know
but
which
it
is
your
duty
to
clear
up
easily
done
says
jean
louis
whose
conviction
is
at
once
shaken
send
for
mlle
boussignol
let
send
for
her
whereupon
mlle
boussignol
arrives
and
mumbles
out
the
little
speech
which
i
have
taught
her
sensation
general
stupefaction
of
which
i
take
advantage
to
carry
off
our
young
man
hortense
shook
her
head
but
they
get
over
it
all
three
of
them
on
thinking
never
never
they
will
have
their
doubts
perhaps
but
they
will
never
consent
to
feel
certain
they
will
never
agree
to
think
use
your
imagination
here
are
three
people
whom
i
have
rescued
from
the
hell
in
which
they
have
been
floundering
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
do
you
think
they
going
back
to
it
here
are
three
people
who
from
weakness
or
a
false
sense
of
duty
had
not
the
courage
to
escape
do
you
think
that
they
wo
cling
like
grim
death
to
the
liberty
which
i
giving
them
nonsense
why
they
would
have
swallowed
a
hoax
twice
as
difficult
to
digest
as
that
which
mlle
boussignol
dished
up
for
them
after
all
my
version
was
no
more
absurd
than
the
truth
on
the
contrary
and
they
swallowed
it
whole
look
at
this
before
we
left
i
heard
madame
and
madame
vaurois
speak
of
an
immediate
removal
they
were
already
becoming
quite
affectionate
at
the
thought
of
seeing
the
last
of
each
other
but
what
about
jean
louis
jean
louis
why
he
was
fed
up
with
his
two
mothers
by
jingo
one
do
with
two
mothers
in
a
what
a
situation
and
when
one
has
the
luck
to
be
able
to
choose
between
having
two
mothers
or
none
at
all
why
bless
me
one
does
hesitate
and
besides
jean
louis
is
in
love
with
geneviève
he
laughed
and
he
loves
her
well
enough
i
hope
and
trust
not
to
inflict
two
upon
her
come
you
may
be
easy
in
your
mind
your
friend
happiness
is
assured
and
that
is
all
you
asked
for
all
that
matters
is
the
object
which
we
achieve
and
not
the
more
or
less
peculiar
nature
of
the
methods
which
we
employ
and
if
some
adventures
are
wound
up
and
some
mysteries
elucidated
by
looking
for
and
finding
or
incendiary
and
blazing
as
on
our
last
expedition
others
call
for
psychology
and
for
purely
psychological
solutions
i
have
spoken
and
i
charge
you
to
be
silent
silent
yes
there
a
man
and
woman
sitting
behind
us
who
seem
to
be
saying
something
uncommonly
interesting
but
they
talking
in
whispers
just
so
when
people
talk
in
whispers
it
always
about
something
shady
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
back
in
his
chair
hortense
listened
but
in
vain
as
for
him
he
was
emitting
little
slow
puffs
of
smoke
fifteen
minutes
later
the
train
stopped
and
the
man
and
woman
got
out
pity
said
rénine
that
i
do
know
their
names
or
where
they
going
but
i
know
where
to
find
them
my
dear
we
have
a
new
adventure
before
us
hortense
protested
oh
no
please
not
yet
give
me
a
little
rest
and
ought
we
to
think
of
geneviève
he
seemed
greatly
surprised
why
all
that
over
and
done
with
do
you
mean
to
say
you
want
to
waste
any
more
time
over
that
old
story
well
i
for
my
part
confess
that
lost
all
interest
in
the
man
with
the
two
mammas
and
this
was
said
in
such
a
comical
tone
and
with
such
diverting
sincerity
that
hortense
was
once
more
seized
with
a
fit
of
giggling
laughter
alone
was
able
to
relax
her
exasperated
nerves
and
to
distract
her
from
so
many
contradictory
emotions
iv
the
film
do
look
at
the
man
who
playing
the
butler
said
serge
rénine
what
is
there
peculiar
about
him
asked
hortense
they
were
sitting
in
the
balcony
at
a
to
which
hortense
had
asked
to
be
taken
so
that
she
might
see
on
the
screen
the
daughter
of
a
lady
now
dead
who
used
to
give
her
rose
andrée
a
lovely
girl
with
lissome
movements
and
a
smiling
face
was
that
evening
figuring
in
a
new
film
happy
which
she
lit
up
with
her
high
spirits
and
her
warm
glowing
beauty
rénine
made
no
direct
reply
but
during
a
pause
in
the
performance
continued
i
sometimes
console
myself
for
an
indifferent
film
by
watching
the
subordinate
characters
it
seems
to
me
that
those
poor
devils
who
are
made
to
rehearse
certain
scenes
ten
or
twenty
times
over
must
often
be
thinking
of
other
things
than
their
parts
at
the
time
of
the
final
exposure
and
it
great
fun
noting
those
little
moments
of
distraction
which
reveal
something
of
their
temperament
of
their
instinct
self
as
for
instance
in
the
case
of
that
butler
look
the
screen
now
showed
a
luxuriously
served
table
the
happy
princess
sat
at
the
head
surrounded
by
all
her
suitors
footmen
moved
about
the
room
under
the
orders
of
the
butler
a
big
fellow
with
a
dull
coarse
face
a
common
appearance
and
a
pair
of
enormous
eyebrows
which
met
across
his
forehead
in
a
single
line
he
looks
a
brute
said
hortense
but
what
do
you
see
in
him
peculiar
just
note
how
he
gazes
at
the
princess
and
tell
me
if
he
does
stare
at
her
oftener
than
he
ought
to
i
really
have
noticed
anything
so
far
said
hortense
why
of
course
he
does
serge
rénine
declared
it
is
quite
obvious
that
in
actual
life
he
entertains
for
rose
andrée
personal
feelings
which
are
quite
out
of
place
in
a
nameless
servant
it
is
possible
that
in
real
life
no
one
has
any
idea
of
such
a
thing
but
on
the
screen
when
he
is
not
watching
himself
or
when
he
thinks
that
the
actors
at
rehearsal
can
not
see
him
his
secret
escapes
him
look
the
man
was
standing
still
it
was
the
end
of
dinner
the
princess
was
drinking
a
glass
of
champagne
and
he
was
gloating
over
her
with
his
glittering
eyes
behind
their
heavy
lids
twice
again
they
surprised
in
his
face
those
strange
expressions
to
which
rénine
ascribed
an
emotional
meaning
which
hortense
refused
to
see
it
just
his
way
of
looking
at
people
she
said
the
first
part
of
the
film
ended
there
were
two
parts
divided
by
an
the
notice
on
the
programme
stated
that
a
year
had
elapsed
and
that
the
happy
princess
was
living
in
a
pretty
norman
cottage
all
hung
with
creepers
together
with
her
husband
a
poor
musician
the
princess
was
still
happy
as
was
evident
on
the
screen
still
as
attractive
as
ever
and
still
besieged
by
the
greatest
variety
of
suitors
nobles
and
commoners
peasants
and
financiers
men
of
all
kinds
fell
swooning
at
her
feet
and
prominent
among
them
was
a
sort
of
boorish
solitary
a
shaggy
woodcutter
whom
she
met
whenever
she
went
out
for
a
walk
armed
with
his
axe
a
formidable
crafty
being
he
prowled
around
the
cottage
and
the
spectators
felt
with
a
sense
of
dismay
that
a
peril
was
hanging
over
the
happy
princess
head
look
at
that
whispered
rénine
do
you
realise
who
the
man
of
the
woods
is
no
simply
the
butler
the
same
actor
is
doubling
the
two
parts
in
fact
notwithstanding
the
new
figure
which
he
cut
the
movements
and
postures
were
apparent
under
the
heavy
gait
and
rounded
shoulders
of
the
woodcutter
even
as
under
the
unkempt
beard
and
long
thick
hair
the
once
face
was
visible
with
the
cruel
expression
and
the
bushy
line
of
the
eyebrows
the
princess
in
the
background
was
seen
to
emerge
from
the
thatched
cottage
the
man
hid
himself
behind
a
clump
of
trees
from
time
to
time
the
screen
displayed
on
an
enormously
enlarged
scale
his
fiercely
rolling
eyes
or
his
murderous
hands
with
their
huge
thumbs
the
man
frightens
me
said
hortense
he
is
really
terrifying
because
he
acting
on
his
own
account
said
rénine
you
must
understand
that
in
the
space
of
three
or
four
months
that
appears
to
separate
the
dates
at
which
the
two
films
were
made
his
passion
has
made
progress
and
to
him
it
is
not
the
princess
who
is
coming
but
rose
andrée
the
man
crouched
low
the
victim
approached
gaily
and
unsuspectingly
she
passed
heard
a
sound
stopped
and
looked
about
her
with
a
smiling
air
which
became
attentive
then
uneasy
and
then
more
and
more
anxious
the
woodcutter
had
pushed
aside
the
branches
and
was
coming
through
the
copse
they
were
now
standing
face
to
face
he
opened
his
arms
as
though
to
seize
her
she
tried
to
scream
to
call
out
for
help
but
the
arms
closed
around
her
before
she
could
offer
the
slightest
resistance
then
he
threw
her
over
his
shoulder
and
began
to
run
are
you
satisfied
whispered
rénine
do
you
think
that
this
actor
would
have
had
all
that
strength
and
energy
if
it
had
been
any
other
woman
than
rose
andrée
meanwhile
the
woodcutter
was
crossing
the
skirt
of
a
forest
and
plunging
through
great
trees
and
masses
of
rocks
after
setting
the
princess
down
he
cleared
the
entrance
to
a
cave
which
the
daylight
entered
by
a
slanting
crevice
a
succession
of
views
displayed
the
husband
despair
the
search
and
the
discovery
of
some
small
branches
which
had
been
broken
by
the
princess
and
which
showed
the
path
that
had
been
taken
then
came
the
final
scene
with
the
terrible
struggle
between
the
man
and
the
woman
when
the
woman
vanquished
and
exhausted
is
flung
to
the
ground
the
sudden
arrival
of
the
husband
and
the
shot
that
puts
an
end
to
the
brute
life
well
said
rénine
when
they
had
left
the
and
he
spoke
with
a
certain
gravity
i
maintain
that
the
daughter
of
your
old
has
been
in
danger
ever
since
the
day
when
that
last
scene
was
filmed
i
maintain
that
this
scene
represents
not
so
much
an
assault
by
the
man
of
the
woods
on
the
happy
princess
as
a
violent
and
frantic
attack
by
an
actor
on
the
woman
he
desires
certainly
it
all
happened
within
the
bounds
prescribed
by
the
part
and
nobody
saw
anything
in
it
nobody
except
perhaps
rose
andrée
herself
but
i
for
my
part
have
detected
flashes
of
passion
which
leave
not
a
doubt
in
my
mind
i
have
seen
glances
that
betrayed
the
wish
and
even
the
intention
to
commit
murder
i
have
seen
clenched
hands
ready
to
strangle
in
short
a
score
of
details
which
prove
to
me
that
at
that
time
the
man
instinct
was
urging
him
to
kill
the
woman
who
could
never
be
his
and
it
all
amounts
to
what
we
must
protect
rose
andrée
if
she
is
still
in
danger
and
if
it
is
not
too
late
and
to
do
this
we
must
get
hold
of
further
information
from
whom
from
the
world
cinema
company
which
made
the
film
i
will
go
to
them
morning
will
you
wait
for
me
in
your
flat
about
at
heart
hortense
was
still
sceptical
all
these
manifestations
of
passion
of
which
she
denied
neither
the
ardour
nor
the
ferocity
seemed
to
her
to
be
the
rational
behaviour
of
a
good
actor
she
had
seen
nothing
of
the
terrible
tragedy
which
rénine
contended
that
he
had
divined
and
she
wondered
whether
he
was
not
erring
through
an
excess
of
imagination
well
she
asked
next
day
not
without
a
touch
of
irony
how
far
have
you
got
have
you
made
a
good
bag
anything
mysterious
anything
thrilling
pretty
good
oh
really
and
your
lover
is
one
dalbrèque
originally
a
who
played
the
butler
in
the
first
part
of
the
film
and
the
man
of
the
woods
in
the
second
and
was
so
much
appreciated
that
they
engaged
him
for
a
new
film
consequently
he
has
been
acting
lately
he
was
acting
near
paris
but
on
the
morning
of
friday
the
of
september
he
broke
into
the
garage
of
the
world
cinema
company
and
made
off
with
a
magnificent
car
and
forty
thousand
francs
in
money
information
was
lodged
with
the
police
and
on
the
sunday
the
car
was
found
a
little
way
outside
dreux
and
up
to
now
the
enquiry
has
revealed
two
things
which
will
appear
in
the
papers
first
dalbrèque
is
alleged
to
have
committed
a
murder
which
created
a
great
stir
last
year
the
murder
of
bourguet
the
jeweller
secondly
on
the
day
after
his
two
robberies
dalbrèque
was
driving
through
le
havre
in
a
with
two
men
who
helped
him
to
carry
off
in
broad
daylight
and
in
a
crowded
street
a
lady
whose
identity
has
not
yet
been
discovered
rose
andrée
asked
hortense
uneasily
i
have
just
been
to
rose
andrée
the
world
cinema
company
gave
me
her
address
rose
andrée
spent
this
summer
travelling
and
then
stayed
for
a
fortnight
in
the
where
she
has
a
small
place
of
her
own
the
actual
cottage
in
happy
on
receiving
an
invitation
from
america
to
do
a
film
there
she
came
back
to
paris
registered
her
luggage
at
the
gare
and
left
on
friday
the
of
september
intending
to
sleep
at
le
havre
and
take
saturday
boat
friday
the
muttered
hortense
the
same
day
on
which
that
man
and
it
was
on
the
saturday
that
a
woman
was
carried
off
by
him
at
le
havre
i
looked
in
at
the
compagnie
transatlantique
and
a
brief
investigation
showed
that
rose
andrée
had
booked
a
cabin
but
that
the
cabin
remained
unoccupied
the
passenger
did
not
turn
up
this
is
frightful
she
has
been
carried
off
you
were
right
i
fear
so
what
have
you
decided
to
do
adolphe
my
chauffeur
is
outside
with
the
car
let
us
go
to
le
havre
up
to
the
present
rose
andrée
disappearance
does
not
seem
to
have
become
known
before
it
does
and
before
the
police
identify
the
woman
carried
off
by
dalbrèque
with
the
woman
who
did
not
turn
up
to
claim
her
cabin
we
will
get
on
rose
andrée
track
there
was
not
much
said
on
the
journey
at
four
hortense
and
rénine
reached
rouen
but
here
rénine
changed
his
road
adolphe
take
the
left
bank
of
the
seine
he
unfolded
a
on
his
knees
and
tracing
the
route
with
his
finger
showed
hortense
that
if
you
draw
a
line
from
le
havre
or
rather
from
quillebeuf
where
the
road
crosses
the
seine
to
dreux
where
the
stolen
car
was
found
this
line
passes
through
routot
a
lying
west
of
the
forest
of
brotonne
now
it
was
in
the
forest
of
brotonne
he
continued
according
to
what
i
heard
that
the
second
part
of
happy
was
filmed
and
the
question
that
arises
is
this
having
got
hold
of
rose
andrée
would
it
not
occur
to
dalbrèque
when
passing
near
the
forest
on
the
saturday
night
to
hide
his
prey
there
while
his
two
accomplices
went
on
to
dreux
and
from
there
returned
to
paris
the
cave
was
quite
near
was
he
not
bound
to
go
to
it
how
should
he
do
otherwise
was
it
while
running
to
this
cave
a
few
months
ago
that
he
held
in
his
arms
against
his
breast
within
reach
of
his
lips
the
woman
whom
he
loved
and
whom
he
has
now
conquered
by
every
rule
of
fate
and
logic
the
adventure
is
being
repeated
all
over
again
but
this
time
in
reality
rose
andrée
is
a
captive
there
is
no
hope
of
rescue
the
forest
is
vast
and
lonely
that
night
or
on
one
of
the
following
nights
rose
andrée
must
surrender
or
die
hortense
gave
a
shudder
we
shall
be
too
late
besides
you
do
suppose
that
he
keeping
her
a
prisoner
certainly
not
the
place
i
have
in
mind
is
at
a
and
is
not
a
safe
retreat
but
we
may
discover
some
clue
or
other
the
shades
of
night
were
falling
from
the
tall
trees
when
they
entered
the
ancient
forest
of
brotonne
full
of
roman
remains
and
mediaeval
relics
rénine
knew
the
forest
well
and
remembered
that
near
a
famous
oak
known
as
the
there
was
a
cave
which
must
be
the
cave
of
the
happy
princess
he
found
it
easily
switched
on
his
electric
torch
rummaged
in
the
dark
corners
and
brought
hortense
back
to
the
entrance
there
nothing
inside
he
said
but
here
is
the
evidence
which
i
was
looking
for
dalbrèque
was
obsessed
by
the
recollection
of
the
film
but
so
was
rose
andrée
the
happy
princess
had
broken
off
the
tips
of
the
branches
on
the
way
through
the
forest
rose
andrée
has
managed
to
break
off
some
to
the
right
of
this
opening
in
the
hope
that
she
would
be
discovered
as
on
the
first
occasion
yes
said
hortense
it
a
proof
that
she
has
been
here
but
the
proof
is
three
weeks
old
since
that
time
since
that
time
she
is
either
dead
and
buried
under
a
heap
of
leaves
or
else
alive
in
some
hole
even
lonelier
than
this
if
so
where
is
he
rénine
pricked
up
his
ears
repeated
blows
of
the
axe
were
sounding
from
some
distance
no
doubt
coming
from
a
part
of
the
forest
that
was
being
cleared
he
said
rénine
i
wonder
whether
he
may
not
have
continued
to
behave
under
the
influence
of
the
film
and
whether
the
man
of
the
woods
in
happy
has
not
quite
naturally
resumed
his
calling
for
how
is
the
man
to
live
to
obtain
his
food
without
attracting
attention
he
will
have
found
a
job
we
ca
make
sure
of
that
we
might
by
questioning
the
woodcutters
whom
we
can
hear
the
car
took
them
by
a
to
another
where
they
entered
on
foot
a
track
which
was
deeply
rutted
by
the
sound
of
axes
ceased
after
walking
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
met
a
dozen
men
who
having
finished
work
for
the
day
were
returning
to
the
villages
near
by
will
this
path
take
us
to
routot
ask
rénine
in
order
to
open
a
conversation
with
them
no
you
turning
your
backs
on
it
said
one
of
the
men
gruffly
and
he
went
on
accompanied
by
his
mates
hortense
and
rénine
stood
rooted
to
the
spot
they
had
recognized
the
butler
his
cheeks
and
chin
were
shaved
but
his
upper
lip
was
covered
by
a
black
moustache
evidently
dyed
the
eyebrows
no
longer
met
and
were
reduced
to
normal
dimensions
thus
in
less
than
twenty
hours
acting
on
the
vague
hints
supplied
by
the
bearing
of
a
serge
rénine
had
touched
the
very
heart
of
the
tragedy
by
means
of
purely
psychological
arguments
rose
andrée
is
alive
he
said
otherwise
dalbrèque
would
have
left
the
country
the
poor
thing
must
be
imprisoned
and
bound
up
and
he
takes
her
some
food
at
night
we
will
save
her
wo
we
certainly
by
keeping
a
watch
on
him
and
if
necessary
but
in
the
last
resort
compelling
him
by
force
to
give
up
his
secret
they
followed
the
woodcutter
at
a
distance
and
on
the
pretext
that
the
car
needed
overhauling
engaged
rooms
in
the
principal
inn
at
routot
attached
to
the
inn
was
a
small
café
from
which
they
were
separated
by
the
entrance
to
the
yard
and
above
which
were
two
rooms
reached
by
a
wooden
outer
staircase
at
one
side
dalbrèque
occupied
one
of
these
rooms
and
rénine
took
the
other
for
his
chauffeur
next
morning
he
learnt
from
adolphe
that
dalbrèque
on
the
previous
evening
after
all
the
lights
were
out
had
carried
down
a
bicycle
from
his
room
and
mounted
it
and
had
not
returned
until
shortly
before
sunrise
the
bicycle
tracks
led
rénine
to
the
uninhabited
château
des
landes
five
miles
from
the
village
they
disappeared
in
a
rocky
path
which
ran
beside
the
park
down
to
the
seine
opposite
the
jumièges
peninsula
next
night
he
took
up
his
position
there
at
eleven
dalbrèque
climbed
a
bank
scrambled
over
a
wire
fence
hid
his
bicycle
under
the
branches
and
moved
away
it
seemed
impossible
to
follow
him
in
the
pitchy
darkness
on
a
mossy
soil
that
muffled
the
sound
of
footsteps
rénine
did
not
make
the
attempt
but
at
daybreak
he
came
with
his
chauffeur
and
hunted
through
the
park
all
the
morning
though
the
park
which
covered
the
side
of
a
hill
and
was
bounded
below
by
the
river
was
not
very
large
he
found
no
clue
which
gave
him
any
reason
to
suppose
that
rose
andrée
was
imprisoned
there
he
therefore
went
back
to
the
village
with
the
firm
intention
of
taking
action
that
evening
and
employing
force
this
state
of
things
can
not
go
on
he
said
to
hortense
i
must
rescue
rose
andrée
at
all
costs
and
save
her
from
that
ruffian
clutches
he
must
be
made
to
speak
he
must
otherwise
there
a
danger
that
we
may
be
too
late
that
day
was
sunday
and
dalbrèque
did
not
go
to
work
he
did
not
leave
his
room
except
for
lunch
and
went
upstairs
again
immediately
afterwards
but
at
three
rénine
and
hortense
who
were
keeping
a
watch
on
him
from
the
inn
saw
him
come
down
the
wooden
staircase
with
his
bicycle
on
his
shoulder
leaning
it
against
the
bottom
step
he
inflated
the
tires
and
fastened
to
the
a
rather
bulky
object
wrapped
in
a
newspaper
by
jove
muttered
rénine
what
the
matter
in
front
of
the
café
was
a
small
terrace
bordered
on
the
right
and
left
by
planted
in
boxes
which
were
connected
by
a
paling
behind
the
shrubs
sitting
on
a
bank
but
stooping
forward
so
that
they
could
see
dalbrèque
through
the
branches
were
four
men
police
said
rénine
what
bad
luck
if
those
fellows
take
a
hand
they
will
spoil
everything
why
on
the
contrary
i
should
have
thought
yes
they
will
they
will
put
dalbrèque
out
of
the
way
and
then
will
that
give
us
rose
andrée
dalbrèque
had
finished
his
preparations
just
as
he
was
mounting
his
bicycle
the
detectives
rose
in
a
body
ready
to
make
a
dash
for
him
but
dalbrèque
though
quite
unconscious
of
their
presence
changed
his
mind
and
went
back
to
his
room
as
though
he
had
forgotten
something
now
the
time
said
rénine
i
going
to
risk
it
but
it
a
difficult
situation
and
i
no
great
hopes
he
went
out
into
the
yard
and
at
a
moment
when
the
detectives
were
not
looking
ran
up
the
staircase
as
was
only
natural
if
he
wished
to
give
an
order
to
his
chauffeur
but
he
had
no
sooner
reached
the
rustic
balcony
at
the
back
of
the
house
which
gave
admission
to
the
two
bedrooms
than
he
stopped
dalbrèque
door
was
open
rénine
walked
in
dalbrèque
stepped
back
at
once
assuming
the
defensive
what
do
you
want
who
said
you
could
silence
whispered
rénine
with
an
imperious
gesture
it
all
up
with
you
what
are
you
talking
about
growled
the
man
angrily
lean
out
of
your
window
there
are
four
men
below
on
the
watch
for
you
to
leave
four
detectives
dalbrèque
leant
over
the
terrace
and
muttered
an
oath
on
the
watch
for
me
he
said
turning
round
what
do
i
care
they
have
a
warrant
he
folded
his
arms
shut
up
with
your
piffle
a
warrant
what
that
to
me
listen
said
rénine
and
let
us
waste
no
time
it
urgent
your
dalbrèque
or
at
least
that
the
name
under
which
you
acted
in
happy
and
under
which
the
police
are
looking
for
you
as
being
the
murderer
of
bourguet
the
jeweller
the
man
who
stole
a
and
forty
thousand
francs
from
the
world
cinema
company
and
the
man
who
abducted
a
woman
at
le
havre
all
this
is
known
and
proved
and
the
upshot
four
men
downstairs
myself
here
my
chauffeur
in
the
next
room
you
done
for
do
you
want
me
to
save
you
dalbrèque
gave
his
adversary
a
long
look
who
are
you
a
friend
of
rose
andrée
said
rénine
the
other
started
and
to
some
extent
dropping
his
mask
retorted
what
are
your
conditions
rose
andrée
whom
you
have
abducted
and
tormented
is
dying
in
some
hole
or
corner
where
is
she
a
strange
thing
occurred
and
impressed
rénine
dalbrèque
face
usually
so
common
was
lit
up
by
a
smile
that
made
it
almost
attractive
but
this
was
only
a
flashing
vision
the
man
immediately
resumed
his
hard
and
impassive
expression
and
suppose
i
refuse
to
speak
he
said
so
much
the
worse
for
you
it
means
your
arrest
i
dare
say
but
it
means
the
death
of
rose
andrée
who
will
release
her
you
you
will
speak
now
or
in
an
hour
or
two
hours
hence
at
least
you
will
never
have
the
heart
to
keep
silent
and
let
her
die
dalbrèque
shrugged
his
shoulders
then
raising
his
hand
he
said
i
swear
on
my
life
that
if
they
arrest
me
not
a
word
will
leave
my
lips
what
then
then
save
me
we
will
meet
this
evening
at
the
entrance
to
the
parc
des
landes
and
say
what
we
have
to
say
why
not
at
once
i
have
spoken
will
you
be
there
i
shall
be
there
rénine
reflected
there
was
something
in
all
this
that
he
failed
to
grasp
in
any
case
the
frightful
danger
that
threatened
rose
andrée
dominated
the
whole
situation
and
rénine
was
not
the
man
to
despise
this
threat
and
to
persist
out
of
vanity
in
a
perilous
course
rose
andrée
life
came
before
everything
he
struck
several
blows
on
the
wall
of
the
next
bedroom
and
called
his
chauffeur
adolphe
is
the
car
ready
yes
sir
set
her
going
and
pull
her
up
in
front
of
the
terrace
outside
the
café
right
against
the
boxes
so
as
to
block
the
exit
as
for
you
he
continued
addressing
dalbrèque
you
to
jump
on
your
machine
and
instead
of
making
off
along
the
road
cross
the
yard
at
the
end
of
the
yard
is
a
passage
leading
into
a
lane
there
you
will
be
free
but
no
hesitation
and
no
blundering
else
you
get
yourself
nabbed
good
luck
to
you
he
waited
till
the
car
was
drawn
up
in
accordance
with
his
instructions
and
when
he
reached
it
he
began
to
question
his
chauffeur
in
order
to
attract
the
detectives
attention
one
of
them
however
having
cast
a
glance
through
the
caught
sight
of
dalbrèque
just
as
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
staircase
he
gave
the
alarm
and
darted
forward
followed
by
his
comrades
but
had
to
run
round
the
car
and
bumped
into
the
chauffeur
which
gave
dalbrèque
time
to
mount
his
bicycle
and
cross
the
yard
unimpeded
he
thus
had
some
seconds
start
unfortunately
for
him
as
he
was
about
to
enter
the
passage
at
the
back
a
troop
of
boys
and
girls
appeared
returning
from
vespers
on
hearing
the
shouts
of
the
detectives
they
spread
their
arms
in
front
of
the
fugitive
who
gave
two
or
three
lurches
and
ended
by
falling
cries
of
triumph
were
raised
lay
hold
of
him
stop
him
roared
the
detectives
as
they
rushed
forward
rénine
seeing
that
the
game
was
up
ran
after
the
others
and
called
out
stop
him
he
came
up
with
them
just
as
dalbrèque
after
regaining
his
feet
knocked
one
of
the
policemen
down
and
levelled
his
revolver
rénine
snatched
it
out
of
his
hands
but
the
two
other
detectives
startled
had
also
produced
their
weapons
they
fired
dalbrèque
hit
in
the
leg
and
the
chest
pitched
forward
and
fell
thank
you
sir
said
the
inspector
to
rénine
introducing
himself
we
owe
a
lot
to
you
it
seems
to
me
that
you
done
for
the
fellow
said
rénine
who
is
he
one
dalbrèque
a
scoundrel
for
whom
we
were
looking
rénine
was
beside
himself
hortense
had
joined
him
by
this
time
and
he
growled
the
silly
fools
now
they
killed
him
oh
it
is
possible
we
shall
see
but
whether
he
dead
or
alive
it
death
to
rose
andrée
how
are
we
to
trace
her
and
what
chance
have
we
of
finding
the
place
some
inaccessible
retreat
where
the
poor
thing
is
dying
of
misery
and
starvation
the
detectives
and
peasants
had
moved
away
bearing
dalbrèque
with
them
on
an
improvised
stretcher
rénine
who
had
at
first
followed
them
in
order
to
find
out
what
was
going
to
happen
changed
his
mind
and
was
now
standing
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
ground
the
fall
of
the
bicycle
had
unfastened
the
parcel
which
dalbrèque
had
tied
to
the
and
the
newspaper
had
burst
revealing
its
contents
a
tin
saucepan
rusty
dented
battered
and
useless
what
the
meaning
of
this
he
muttered
what
was
the
idea
he
picked
it
up
examined
it
then
he
gave
a
grin
and
a
click
of
the
tongue
and
chuckled
slowly
do
move
an
eyelash
my
dear
let
all
these
people
clear
off
all
this
is
no
business
of
ours
is
it
the
troubles
of
police
do
concern
us
we
are
two
motorists
travelling
for
our
pleasure
and
collecting
old
saucepans
if
we
feel
so
inclined
he
called
his
chauffeur
adolphe
take
us
to
the
parc
des
landes
by
a
roundabout
road
half
an
hour
later
they
reached
the
sunken
track
and
began
to
scramble
down
it
on
foot
beside
the
wooded
slopes
the
seine
which
was
very
low
at
this
time
of
day
was
lapping
against
a
little
jetty
near
which
lay
a
mouldering
boat
full
of
puddles
of
water
rénine
stepped
into
the
boat
and
at
once
began
to
bale
out
the
puddles
with
his
saucepan
he
then
drew
the
boat
alongside
of
the
jetty
helped
hortense
in
and
used
the
one
oar
which
he
shipped
in
a
gap
in
the
stern
to
work
her
into
midstream
i
believe
i
there
he
said
with
a
laugh
the
worst
that
can
happen
to
us
is
to
get
our
feet
wet
for
our
craft
leaks
a
trifle
but
have
we
a
saucepan
oh
blessings
on
that
useful
utensil
almost
as
soon
as
i
set
eyes
upon
it
i
remembered
that
people
use
those
articles
to
bale
out
the
bottoms
of
leaky
boats
why
there
was
bound
to
be
a
boat
in
the
landes
woods
how
was
it
i
never
thought
of
that
but
of
course
dalbrèque
made
use
of
her
to
cross
the
seine
and
as
she
made
water
he
brought
a
saucepan
then
rose
andrée
asked
hortense
is
a
prisoner
on
the
other
bank
on
the
jumièges
peninsula
you
see
the
famous
abbey
from
here
they
ran
aground
on
a
beach
of
big
pebbles
covered
with
slime
and
it
ca
be
very
far
away
he
added
dalbrèque
did
not
spend
the
whole
night
running
about
a
followed
the
deserted
bank
another
path
led
away
from
it
they
chose
the
second
and
passing
between
orchards
enclosed
by
hedges
came
to
a
landscape
that
seemed
strangely
familiar
to
them
where
had
they
seen
that
pool
before
with
the
willows
overhanging
it
and
where
had
they
seen
that
abandoned
hovel
suddenly
both
of
them
stopped
with
one
accord
oh
said
hortense
i
can
hardly
believe
my
eyes
opposite
them
was
the
white
gate
of
a
large
orchard
at
the
back
of
which
among
groups
of
old
gnarled
appeared
a
cottage
with
blue
shutters
the
cottage
of
the
happy
princess
of
course
cried
rénine
and
i
ought
to
have
known
it
considering
that
the
film
showed
both
this
cottage
and
the
forest
close
by
and
everything
happening
exactly
as
in
happy
dalbrèque
dominated
by
the
memory
of
it
the
house
which
is
certainly
the
one
in
which
rose
andrée
spent
the
summer
was
empty
he
has
shut
her
up
there
but
the
house
you
told
me
was
in
the
well
so
are
we
to
the
left
of
the
river
the
eure
and
the
forest
of
brotonne
to
the
right
the
but
between
them
is
the
obstacle
of
the
river
which
is
why
i
did
connect
the
two
a
hundred
and
fifty
yards
of
water
form
a
more
effective
division
than
dozens
of
miles
the
gate
was
locked
they
got
through
the
hedge
a
little
lower
down
and
walked
towards
the
house
which
was
screened
on
one
side
by
an
old
wall
shaggy
with
ivy
and
roofed
with
thatch
it
seems
as
if
there
was
somebody
there
said
hortense
did
i
hear
the
sound
of
a
window
listen
some
one
struck
a
few
chords
on
a
piano
then
a
voice
arose
a
voice
softly
and
solemnly
singing
a
ballad
that
thrilled
with
restrained
passion
the
woman
whole
soul
seemed
to
breathe
itself
into
the
melodious
notes
they
walked
on
the
wall
concealed
them
from
view
but
they
saw
a
furnished
with
bright
and
a
blue
roman
carpet
the
throbbing
voice
ceased
the
piano
ended
with
a
last
chord
and
the
singer
rose
and
appeared
framed
in
the
window
rose
andrée
whispered
hortense
well
said
rénine
admitting
his
astonishment
this
is
the
last
thing
that
i
expected
rose
andrée
rose
andrée
at
liberty
and
singing
massenet
in
the
sitting
room
of
her
cottage
what
does
it
all
mean
do
you
understand
yes
but
it
has
taken
me
long
enough
but
how
could
we
have
guessed
although
they
had
never
seen
her
except
on
the
screen
they
had
not
the
least
doubt
that
this
was
she
it
was
really
rose
andrée
or
rather
the
happy
princess
whom
they
had
admired
a
few
days
before
amidst
the
furniture
of
that
very
or
on
the
threshold
of
that
very
cottage
she
was
wearing
the
same
dress
her
hair
was
done
in
the
same
way
she
had
on
the
same
bangles
and
necklaces
as
in
happy
and
her
lovely
face
with
its
rosy
cheeks
and
laughing
eyes
bore
the
same
look
of
joy
and
serenity
some
sound
must
have
caught
her
ear
for
she
leant
over
towards
a
clump
of
shrubs
beside
the
cottage
and
whispered
into
the
silent
garden
georges
georges
is
that
you
my
darling
receiving
no
reply
she
drew
herself
up
and
stood
smiling
at
the
happy
thoughts
that
seemed
to
flood
her
being
but
a
door
opened
at
the
back
of
the
room
and
an
old
peasant
woman
entered
with
a
tray
laden
with
bread
butter
and
milk
here
rose
my
pretty
one
i
brought
you
your
supper
milk
fresh
from
the
cow
and
putting
down
the
tray
she
continued
are
you
afraid
rose
of
the
chill
of
the
night
air
perhaps
expecting
your
sweetheart
i
have
a
sweetheart
my
dear
old
catherine
what
next
said
the
old
woman
laughing
only
this
morning
there
were
footprints
under
the
window
that
did
look
at
all
proper
a
burglar
footprints
perhaps
catherine
well
i
do
say
they
were
rose
dear
especially
as
in
your
calling
you
have
a
lot
of
people
round
you
whom
it
well
to
be
careful
of
for
instance
your
friend
dalbrèque
eh
nice
goings
on
his
are
you
saw
the
paper
yesterday
a
fellow
who
has
robbed
and
murdered
people
and
carried
off
a
woman
at
le
havre
hortense
and
rénine
would
have
much
liked
to
know
what
rose
andrée
thought
of
the
revelations
but
she
had
turned
her
back
to
them
and
was
sitting
at
her
supper
and
the
window
was
now
closed
so
that
they
could
neither
hear
her
reply
nor
see
the
expression
of
her
features
they
waited
for
a
moment
hortense
was
listening
with
an
anxious
face
but
rénine
began
to
laugh
very
funny
really
funny
and
such
an
unexpected
ending
and
we
who
were
hunting
for
her
in
some
cave
or
damp
cellar
a
horrible
tomb
where
the
poor
thing
was
dying
of
hunger
it
a
fact
she
knew
the
terrors
of
that
first
night
of
captivity
and
i
maintain
that
on
that
first
night
she
was
flung
into
the
cave
only
there
you
are
the
next
morning
she
was
alive
one
night
was
enough
to
tame
the
little
rogue
and
to
make
dalbrèque
as
handsome
as
prince
charming
in
her
eyes
for
see
the
difference
on
the
films
or
in
novels
the
happy
princesses
resist
or
commit
suicide
but
in
real
life
oh
woman
woman
yes
said
hortense
but
the
man
she
loves
is
almost
certainly
dead
and
a
good
thing
too
it
would
be
the
best
solution
what
would
be
the
outcome
of
this
criminal
love
for
a
thief
and
murderer
a
few
minutes
passed
then
amid
the
peaceful
silence
of
the
waning
day
mingled
with
the
first
shadows
of
the
twilight
they
again
heard
the
grating
of
the
window
which
was
cautiously
opened
rose
andrée
leant
over
the
garden
and
waited
with
her
eyes
turned
to
the
wall
as
though
she
saw
something
there
presently
rénine
shook
the
ah
she
said
this
time
i
know
you
there
yes
the
ivy
moving
georges
georges
darling
why
do
you
keep
me
waiting
catherine
has
gone
i
am
all
alone
she
had
knelt
down
and
was
distractedly
stretching
out
her
shapely
arms
covered
with
bangles
which
clashed
with
a
metallic
sound
georges
georges
her
every
movement
the
thrill
of
her
voice
her
whole
being
expressed
desire
and
love
hortense
deeply
touched
could
not
help
saying
how
the
poor
thing
loves
him
if
she
but
knew
ah
cried
the
girl
you
spoken
you
there
and
you
want
me
to
come
to
you
do
you
here
i
am
georges
she
climbed
over
the
and
began
to
run
while
rénine
went
round
the
wall
and
advanced
to
meet
her
she
stopped
short
in
front
of
him
and
stood
choking
at
the
sight
of
this
man
and
woman
whom
she
did
not
know
and
who
were
stepping
out
of
the
very
shadow
from
which
her
beloved
appeared
to
her
each
night
rénine
bowed
gave
his
name
and
introduced
his
companion
madame
hortense
daniel
a
pupil
and
friend
of
your
mother
still
motionless
with
stupefaction
her
features
drawn
she
stammered
you
know
who
i
am
and
you
were
there
just
now
you
heard
what
i
was
saying
rénine
without
hesitating
or
pausing
in
his
speech
said
you
are
rose
andrée
the
happy
princess
we
saw
you
on
the
films
the
other
evening
and
circumstances
led
us
to
set
out
in
search
of
you
to
le
havre
where
you
were
abducted
on
the
day
when
you
were
to
have
left
for
america
and
to
the
forest
of
brotonne
where
you
were
imprisoned
she
protested
eagerly
with
a
forced
laugh
what
is
all
this
i
have
not
been
to
le
havre
i
came
straight
here
abducted
imprisoned
what
nonsense
yes
imprisoned
in
the
same
cave
as
the
happy
princess
and
you
broke
off
some
branches
to
the
right
of
the
cave
but
how
absurd
who
would
have
abducted
me
i
have
no
enemy
there
is
a
man
in
love
with
you
the
one
whom
you
were
expecting
just
now
yes
my
lover
she
said
proudly
have
i
not
the
right
to
receive
whom
i
like
you
have
the
right
you
are
a
free
agent
but
the
man
who
comes
to
see
you
every
evening
is
wanted
by
the
police
his
name
is
georges
dalbrèque
he
killed
bourguet
the
jeweller
the
accusation
made
her
start
with
indignation
and
she
exclaimed
it
a
lie
an
infamous
fabrication
of
the
newspapers
georges
was
in
paris
on
the
night
of
the
murder
he
can
prove
it
he
stole
a
motor
car
and
forty
thousand
francs
in
notes
she
retorted
vehemently
the
was
taken
back
by
his
friends
and
the
notes
will
be
restored
he
never
touched
them
my
leaving
for
america
had
made
him
lose
his
head
very
well
i
am
quite
willing
to
believe
everything
that
you
say
but
the
police
may
show
less
faith
in
these
statements
and
less
indulgence
she
became
suddenly
uneasy
and
faltered
the
police
there
nothing
to
fear
from
them
they
wo
know
where
to
find
him
i
succeeded
at
all
events
he
working
as
a
woodcutter
in
the
forest
of
brotonne
yes
but
you
that
was
an
accident
whereas
the
police
the
words
left
her
lips
with
the
greatest
difficulty
her
voice
was
trembling
and
suddenly
she
rushed
at
rénine
stammering
he
is
arrested
i
am
sure
of
it
and
you
have
come
to
tell
me
arrested
wounded
dead
perhaps
oh
please
please
she
had
no
strength
left
all
her
pride
all
the
certainty
of
her
great
love
gave
way
to
an
immense
despair
and
she
sobbed
out
no
he
not
dead
is
he
no
i
feel
that
he
not
dead
oh
sir
how
unjust
it
all
is
he
the
gentlest
man
the
best
that
ever
lived
he
has
changed
my
whole
life
everything
is
different
since
i
began
to
love
him
and
i
love
him
so
i
love
him
i
want
to
go
to
him
take
me
to
him
i
want
them
to
arrest
me
too
i
love
him
i
could
not
live
without
him
an
impulse
of
sympathy
made
hortense
put
her
arms
around
the
girl
neck
and
say
warmly
yes
come
he
is
not
dead
i
am
sure
only
wounded
and
prince
rénine
will
save
him
you
will
wo
you
rénine
come
make
up
a
story
for
your
servant
say
that
you
going
somewhere
by
train
and
that
she
is
not
to
tell
anybody
be
quick
put
on
a
wrap
we
will
save
him
i
swear
we
will
rose
andrée
went
indoors
and
returned
almost
at
once
disguised
beyond
recognition
in
a
long
cloak
and
a
veil
that
shrouded
her
face
and
they
all
took
the
road
back
to
routot
at
the
inn
rose
andrée
passed
as
a
friend
whom
they
had
been
to
fetch
in
the
neighbourhood
and
were
taking
to
paris
with
them
rénine
ran
out
to
make
enquiries
and
came
back
to
the
two
women
it
all
right
dalbrèque
is
alive
they
have
put
him
to
bed
in
a
private
room
at
the
mayor
offices
he
has
a
broken
leg
and
a
rather
high
temperature
but
all
the
same
they
expect
to
move
him
to
rouen
and
they
have
telephoned
there
for
a
and
then
asked
rose
andrée
anxiously
rénine
smiled
why
then
we
shall
leave
at
daybreak
we
shall
take
up
our
positions
in
a
sunken
road
rifle
in
hand
attack
the
and
carry
off
georges
oh
do
laugh
she
said
plaintively
i
am
so
unhappy
but
the
adventure
seemed
to
amuse
rénine
and
when
he
was
alone
with
hortense
he
exclaimed
you
see
what
comes
of
preferring
dishonour
to
death
but
hang
it
all
who
could
have
expected
this
it
is
a
bit
the
way
in
which
things
happen
in
the
pictures
once
the
man
of
the
woods
had
carried
off
his
victim
and
considering
that
for
three
weeks
there
was
no
one
to
defend
her
how
could
we
imagine
we
who
had
been
proceeding
all
along
under
the
influence
of
the
pictures
that
in
the
space
of
a
few
hours
the
victim
would
become
a
princess
in
love
confound
that
georges
i
now
understand
the
sly
humorous
look
which
i
surprised
on
his
mobile
features
he
remembered
georges
did
and
he
did
care
a
hang
for
me
oh
he
tricked
me
nicely
and
you
my
dear
he
tricked
you
too
and
it
was
all
the
influence
of
the
film
they
show
us
at
the
cinema
a
brute
beast
a
sort
of
savage
what
can
a
man
like
that
be
in
real
life
a
brute
inevitably
do
you
agree
well
he
nothing
of
the
kind
he
a
don
juan
the
humbug
you
will
save
him
wo
you
said
hortense
in
a
beseeching
tone
are
you
very
anxious
that
i
should
very
in
that
case
promise
to
give
me
your
hand
to
kiss
you
can
have
both
hands
rénine
and
gladly
the
night
was
uneventful
rénine
had
given
orders
for
the
two
ladies
to
be
waked
at
an
early
hour
when
they
came
down
the
motor
was
leaving
the
yard
and
pulling
up
in
front
of
the
inn
it
was
raining
and
adolphe
the
chauffeur
had
fixed
up
the
long
low
hood
and
packed
the
luggage
inside
rénine
called
for
his
bill
they
all
three
took
a
cup
of
coffee
but
just
as
they
were
leaving
the
room
one
of
the
inspector
men
came
rushing
in
have
you
seen
him
he
asked
is
he
here
the
inspector
himself
arrived
at
a
run
greatly
excited
the
prisoner
has
escaped
he
ran
back
through
the
inn
he
ca
be
far
away
a
dozen
rustics
appeared
like
a
whirlwind
they
ransacked
the
lofts
the
stables
the
sheds
they
scattered
over
the
neighbourhood
but
the
search
led
to
no
discovery
oh
hang
it
all
said
rénine
who
had
taken
his
part
in
the
hunt
how
can
it
have
happened
how
do
i
know
spluttered
the
inspector
in
despair
i
left
my
three
men
watching
in
the
next
room
i
found
them
this
morning
fast
asleep
stupefied
by
some
narcotic
which
had
been
mixed
with
their
wine
and
the
dalbrèque
bird
had
flown
which
way
through
the
window
there
were
evidently
accomplices
with
ropes
and
a
ladder
and
as
dalbrèque
had
a
broken
leg
they
carried
him
off
on
the
stretcher
itself
they
left
no
traces
no
traces
of
footsteps
true
the
rain
has
messed
everything
up
but
they
went
through
the
yard
because
the
stretcher
there
you
find
him
mr
inspector
there
no
doubt
of
that
in
any
case
you
may
be
sure
that
you
wo
have
any
trouble
over
the
affair
i
shall
be
in
paris

evening
and
shall
go
straight
to
the
prefecture
where
i
have
influential
friends

back
to
the
two
women
in
the
and
hortense

once
said
it
was

carried
him

so
terrified
he
gave
rose
andrée
his
arm
and
led
her
to
the
car
she
was
staggering
and
very
pale
and
she
said
in
a
faint
voice
are
we
going
and
he
is
he
safe
wo
they
catch
him
again
looking
deep
into
her
eyes
he
said

to
me
rose
andrée
that
in
two
months
when
he
is
well
and
when
i
have
proved
his
innocence

with
him
to
america

and
that
once
there

he
spoke
a
few
words
in
her
ear
ah
she
said
may
heaven
bless
you
for
it
hortense
took
her
seat
in
front
with
rénine
who
sat
at
the
wheel
the
inspector
hat
in
hand
fussed
around
the
car
until
it
moved
off
they
drove
through
the
forest
crossed
the
seine
at
la
mailleraie
and
struck
into
the
road
take
off
your
glove
and
give
me
your
hand
to
kiss
rénine
ordered
you
promised
that
you
would
oh
said
hortense
but
it
was
to
be
when
dalbrèque
was
saved
he
is
saved
not
yet
the
police
are
after
him
they
may
catch
him
again
he
will
not
be
really
saved
until
he
is
with
rose
andrée
he
is
with
rose
andrée
he
declared
what
do
you
mean
turn
round
she
did
so
in
the
shadow
of
the
hood
right
at
the
back
behind
the
chauffeur
rose
andrée
was
kneeling
beside
a
man
lying
on
the
seat
oh
stammered
hortense
it
incredible
then
it
was
you
who
hid
him
last
night
and
he
was
there
in
front
of
the
inn
when
the
inspector
was
seeing
us
off
lord
yes
he
was
there
under
the
cushions
and
rugs
it
incredible
she
repeated
utterly
bewildered
it
incredible
how
were
you
able
to
manage
it
all
i
wanted
to
kiss
your
hand
he
said
she
removed
her
glove
as
he
bade
her
and
raised
her
hand
to
his
lips
the
car
was
speeding
between
the
peaceful
seine
and
the
white
cliffs
that
border
it
they
sat
silent
for
a
long
while
then
he
said
i
had
a
talk
with
dalbrèque
last
night
he
a
fine
fellow
and
is
ready
to
do
anything
for
rose
andrée
he
right
a
man
must
do
anything
for
the
woman
he
loves
he
must
devote
himself
to
her
offer
her
all
that
is
beautiful
in
this
world
joy
and
happiness
and
if
she
should
be
bored
stirring
adventures
to
distract
her
to
excite
her
and
to
make
her
smile
or
even
weep
hortense
shivered
and
her
eyes
were
not
quite
free
from
tears
for
the
first
time
he
was
alluding
to
the
sentimental
adventure
that
bound
them
by
a
tie
which
as
yet
was
frail
but
which
became
stronger
and
more
enduring
with
each
of
the
ventures
on
which
they
entered
together
pursuing
them
feverishly
and
anxiously
to
their
close
already
she
felt
powerless
and
uneasy
with
this
extraordinary
man
who
subjected
events
to
his
will
and
seemed
to
play
with
the
destinies
of
those
whom
he
fought
or
protected
he
filled
her
with
dread
and
at
the
same
time
he
attracted
her
she
thought
of
him
sometimes
as
her
master
sometimes
as
an
enemy
against
whom
she
must
defend
herself
but
oftenest
as
a
perturbing
friend
full
of
charm
and
fascination
v
thérèse
and
germaine
the
weather
was
so
mild
that
autumn
that
on
the
of
october
in
the
morning
several
families
still
lingering
in
their
villas
at
étretat
had
gone
down
to
the
beach
the
sea
lying
between
the
cliffs
and
the
clouds
on
the
horizon
might
have
suggested
a
slumbering
in
the
hollow
of
the
enclosing
rocks
were
it
not
for
that
crispness
in
the
air
and
those
pale
soft
and
indefinite
colours
in
the
sky
which
give
a
special
charm
to
certain
days
in
normandy
it
delicious
murmured
hortense
but
the
next
moment
she
added
all
the
same
we
did
not
come
here
to
enjoy
the
spectacle
of
nature
or
to
wonder
whether
that
huge
stone
needle
on
our
left
was
really
at
one
time
the
home
of
arsène
lupin
we
came
here
said
prince
rénine
because
of
the
conversation
which
i
overheard
a
fortnight
ago
in
a
between
a
man
and
a
woman
a
conversation
of
which
i
was
unable
to
catch
a
single
word
if
those
two
people
could
have
guessed
for
an
instant
that
it
was
possible
to
hear
a
single
word
of
what
they
were
saying
they
would
not
have
spoken
for
their
conversation
was
one
of
extraordinary
gravity
and
importance
but
i
have
very
sharp
ears
and
though
i
could
not
follow
every
sentence
i
insist
that
we
may
be
certain
of
two
things
first
that
man
and
woman
who
are
brother
and
sister
have
an
appointment
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
this
morning
the
of
october
at
the
spot
known
as
the
trois
mathildes
with
a
third
person
who
is
married
and
who
wishes
at
all
costs
to
recover
his
or
her
liberty
secondly
this
appointment
at
which
they
will
come
to
a
final
agreement
is
to
be
followed
this
evening
by
a
walk
along
the
cliffs
when
the
third
person
will
bring
with
him
or
her
the
man
or
woman
i
ca
definitely
say
which
whom
they
want
to
get
rid
of
that
is
the
gist
of
the
whole
thing
now
as
i
know
a
spot
called
the
trois
mathildes
some
way
above
étretat
and
as
this
is
not
an
everyday
name
we
came
down
yesterday
to
thwart
the
plan
of
these
objectionable
persons
what
plan
asked
hortense
for
after
all
it
only
your
assumption
that
there
to
be
a
victim
and
that
the
victim
is
to
be
flung
off
the
top
of
the
cliffs
you
yourself
told
me
that
you
heard
no
allusion
to
a
possible
murder
that
is
so
but
i
heard
some
very
plain
words
relating
to
the
marriage
of
the
brother
or
the
sister
with
the
wife
or
the
husband
of
the
third
person
which
implies
the
need
for
a
crime
they
were
sitting
on
the
terrace
of
the
casino
facing
the
stairs
which
run
down
to
the
beach
they
therefore
overlooked
the
few
cabins
on
the
shingle
where
a
party
of
four
men
were
playing
bridge
while
a
group
of
ladies
sat
talking
and
knitting
a
short
distance
away
and
nearer
to
the
sea
was
another
cabin
standing
by
itself
and
closed
children
were
paddling
in
the
water
no
said
hortense
all
this
autumnal
sweetness
and
charm
fails
to
attract
me
i
have
so
much
faith
in
all
your
theories
that
i
ca
help
thinking
in
spite
of
everything
of
this
dreadful
problem
which
of
those
people
yonder
is
threatened
death
has
already
selected
its
victim
who
is
it
is
it
that
young
woman
rocking
herself
and
laughing
is
it
that
tall
man
over
there
smoking
his
cigar
and
which
of
them
has
the
thought
of
murder
hidden
in
his
heart
all
the
people
we
see
are
quietly
enjoying
themselves
yet
death
is
prowling
among
them
capital
said
rénine
you
too
are
becoming
enthusiastic
what
did
i
tell
you
the
whole
of
life
an
adventure
and
nothing
but
adventure
is
worth
while
at
the
first
breath
of
coming
events
there
you
are
quivering
in
every
nerve
you
share
in
all
the
tragedies
stirring
around
you
and
the
feeling
of
mystery
awakens
in
the
depths
of
your
being
see
how
closely
you
are
observing
that
couple
who
have
just
arrived
you
never
can
tell
that
may
be
the
gentleman
who
proposes
to
do
away
with
his
wife
or
perhaps
the
lady
contemplates
making
away
with
her
husband
the
never
a
perfectly
happy
couple
yesterday
at
the
hotel
i
had
a
long
talk
with
the
wife
and
you
yourself
oh
i
played
a
round
of
golf
with
jacques
who
rather
fancies
himself
as
an
athlete
and
i
played
at
dolls
with
their
two
charming
little
girls
the
came
up
and
exchanged
a
few
words
with
them
madame
said
that
her
two
daughters
had
gone
back
to
paris
that
morning
with
their
governess
her
husband
a
great
tall
fellow
with
a
yellow
beard
carrying
his
blazer
over
his
arm
and
puffing
out
his
chest
under
a
cellular
shirt
complained
of
the
heat
have
you
the
key
of
the
cabin
thérèse
he
asked
his
wife
when
they
had
left
rénine
and
hortense
and
stopped
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
a
few
yards
away
here
it
is
said
the
wife
are
you
going
to
read
your
papers
yes
unless
we
go
for
a
stroll
i
had
rather
wait
till
the
afternoon
do
you
mind
i
have
a
lot
of
letters
to
write
this
morning
very
well
we
go
on
the
cliff
hortense
and
rénine
exchanged
a
glance
of
surprise
was
this
suggestion
accidental
or
had
they
before
them
contrary
to
their
expectations
the
very
couple
of
whom
they
were
in
search
hortense
tried
to
laugh
my
heart
is
thumping
she
said
nevertheless
i
absolutely
refuse
to
believe
in
anything
so
improbable
husband
and
i
have
never
had
the
slightest
quarrel
she
said
to
me
no
it
quite
clear
that
those
two
get
on
admirably
we
shall
see
presently
at
the
trois
mathildes
if
one
of
them
comes
to
meet
the
brother
and
sister
had
gone
down
the
stairs
while
his
wife
stood
leaning
on
the
balustrade
of
the
terrace
she
had
a
beautiful
slender
supple
figure
her
profile
was
emphasized
by
a
rather
too
prominent
chin
when
at
rest
and
when
it
was
not
smiling
the
face
gave
an
expression
of
sadness
and
suffering
have
you
lost
something
jacques
she
called
out
to
her
husband
who
was
stooping
over
the
shingle
yes
the
key
he
said
it
slipped
out
of
my
hand
she
went
down
to
him
and
began
to
look
also
for
two
or
three
minutes
as
they
sheered
off
to
the
right
and
remained
close
to
the
bottom
of
the
they
were
invisible
to
hortense
and
rénine
their
voices
were
covered
by
the
noise
of
a
dispute
which
had
arisen
among
the
they
reappeared
almost
simultaneously
madame
slowly
climbed
a
few
steps
of
the
stairs
and
then
stopped
and
turned
her
face
towards
the
sea
her
husband
had
thrown
his
blazer
over
his
shoulders
and
was
making
for
the
isolated
cabin
as
he
passed
the
they
asked
him
for
a
decision
pointing
to
their
cards
spread
out
upon
the
table
but
with
a
wave
of
the
hand
he
refused
to
give
an
opinion
and
walked
on
covered
the
thirty
yards
which
divided
them
from
the
cabin
opened
the
door
and
went
in
thérèse
came
back
to
the
terrace
and
remained
for
ten
minutes
sitting
on
a
bench
then
she
came
out
through
the
casino
hortense
on
leaning
forward
saw
her
entering
one
of
the
chalets
annexed
to
the
hôtel
hauville
and
a
moment
later
caught
sight
of
her
again
on
the
balcony
eleven
said
rénine
whoever
it
is
he
or
she
or
one
of
the
or
one
of
their
wives
it
wo
be
long
before
some
one
goes
to
the
appointed
place
nevertheless
twenty
minutes
passed
and
and
no
one
stirred
perhaps
madame
has
gone
hortense
suggested
anxiously
she
is
no
longer
on
her
balcony
if
she
is
at
the
trois
mathildes
said
rénine
we
will
go
and
catch
her
there
he
was
rising
to
his
feet
when
a
fresh
discussion
broke
out
among
the
and
one
of
them
exclaimed
let
put
it
to
very
well
said
his
adversary
i
accept
his
decision
if
he
consents
to
act
as
umpire
he
was
rather
huffy
just
now
they
called
out
they
then
saw
that
must
have
shut
the
door
behind
him
which
kept
him
in
the
half
dark
the
cabin
being
one
of
the
sort
that
has
no
window
he
asleep
cried
one
let
wake
him
up
all
four
went
to
the
cabin
began
by
calling
to
him
and
on
receiving
no
answer
thumped
on
the
door
hi
are
you
asleep
on
the
terrace
serge
rénine
suddenly
leapt
to
his
feet
with
so
uneasy
an
air
that
hortense
was
astonished
he
muttered
if
only
it
not
too
late
and
when
hortense
asked
him
what
he
meant
he
tore
down
the
steps
and
started
running
to
the
cabin
he
reached
it
just
as
the
were
trying
to
break
in
the
door
stop
he
ordered
things
must
be
done
in
the
regular
fashion
what
things
they
asked
he
examined
the
venetian
shutters
at
the
top
of
each
of
the
and
on
finding
that
one
of
the
upper
slats
was
partly
broken
hung
on
as
best
he
could
to
the
roof
of
the
cabin
and
cast
a
glance
inside
then
he
said
to
the
four
men
i
was
right
in
thinking
that
if
did
not
reply
he
must
have
been
prevented
by
some
serious
cause
there
is
every
reason
to
believe
that
is
wounded
or
dead
dead
they
cried
what
do
you
mean
he
has
only
just
left
us
rénine
took
out
his
knife
prized
open
the
lock
and
pulled
back
the
two
doors
there
were
shouts
of
dismay
was
lying
flat
on
his
face
clutching
his
jacket
and
his
newspaper
in
his
hands
blood
was
flowing
from
his
back
and
staining
his
shirt
oh
said
some
one
he
has
killed
himself
how
can
he
have
killed
himself
said
rénine
the
wound
is
right
in
the
middle
of
the
back
at
a
place
which
the
hand
ca
reach
and
besides
there
not
a
knife
in
the
cabin
the
others
protested
if
so
he
has
been
murdered
but
that
impossible
there
has
been
nobody
here
we
should
have
seen
if
there
had
been
nobody
could
have
passed
us
without
our
seeing
the
other
men
all
the
ladies
and
the
children
paddling
in
the
sea
had
come
running
up
rénine
allowed
no
one
to
enter
the
cabin
except
a
doctor
who
was
present
but
the
doctor
could
only
say
that
was
dead
stabbed
with
a
dagger
at
that
moment
the
mayor
and
the
policeman
arrived
together
with
some
people
of
the
village
after
the
usual
enquiries
they
carried
away
the
body
a
few
persons
went
on
ahead
to
break
the
news
to
thérèse
who
was
once
more
to
be
seen
on
her
balcony
and
so
the
tragedy
had
taken
place
without
any
clue
to
explain
how
a
man
protected
by
a
closed
door
with
an
uninjured
lock
could
have
been
murdered
in
the
space
of
a
few
minutes
and
in
front
of
twenty
witnesses
one
might
almost
say
twenty
spectators
no
one
had
entered
the
cabin
no
one
had
come
out
of
it
as
for
the
dagger
with
which
had
been
stabbed
between
the
shoulders
it
could
not
be
traced
and
all
this
would
have
suggested
the
idea
of
a
trick
of
performed
by
a
clever
conjuror
had
it
not
concerned
a
terrible
murder
committed
under
the
most
mysterious
conditions
hortense
was
unable
to
follow
as
rénine
would
have
liked
the
small
party
who
were
making
for
madame
she
was
paralysed
with
excitement
and
incapable
of
moving
it
was
the
first
time
that
her
adventures
with
rénine
had
taken
her
into
the
very
heart
of
the
action
and
that
instead
of
noting
the
consequences
of
a
murder
or
assisting
in
the
pursuit
of
the
criminals
she
found
herself
confronted
with
the
murder
itself
it
left
her
trembling
all
over
and
she
stammered
how
horrible
the
poor
fellow
ah
rénine
you
could
save
him
this
time
and
what
upsets
me
more
than
anything
that
we
could
and
should
have
saved
him
since
we
knew
of
the
plot
rénine
made
her
sniff
at
a
bottle
of
salts
and
when
she
had
quite
recovered
her
composure
he
said
while
observing
her
attentively
so
you
think
that
there
is
some
connection
between
the
murder
and
the
plot
which
we
were
trying
to
frustrate
certainly
said
she
astonished
at
the
question
then
as
that
plot
was
hatched
by
a
husband
against
his
wife
or
by
a
wife
against
her
husband
you
admit
that
madame
oh
no
impossible
she
said
to
begin
with
madame
did
not
leave
her
rooms
and
then
i
shall
never
believe
that
pretty
woman
capable
no
no
of
course
there
was
something
else
what
else
i
do
know
you
may
have
misunderstood
what
the
brother
and
sister
were
saying
to
each
other
you
see
the
murder
has
been
committed
under
quite
different
conditions
at
another
hour
and
another
place
and
therefore
concluded
rénine
the
two
cases
are
not
in
any
way
related
oh
she
said
there
no
making
it
out
it
all
so
strange
rénine
became
a
little
satirical
my
pupil
is
doing
me
no
credit
he
said
why
here
is
a
perfectly
simple
story
unfolded
before
your
eyes
you
have
seen
it
reeled
off
like
a
scene
in
the
cinema
and
it
all
remains
as
obscure
to
you
as
though
you
were
hearing
of
an
affair
that
happened
in
a
cave
a
hundred
miles
away
hortense
was
confounded
what
are
you
saying
do
you
mean
that
you
have
understood
it
what
clues
have
you
to
go
by
rénine
looked
at
his
watch
i
have
not
understood
everything
he
said
the
murder
itself
the
mere
brutal
murder
yes
but
the
essential
thing
that
is
to
say
the
psychology
of
the
crime
i
no
clue
to
that
only
it
is
twelve
the
brother
and
sister
seeing
no
one
come
to
the
appointment
at
the
trois
mathildes
will
go
down
to
the
beach
do
you
think
that
we
shall
learn
something
then
of
the
accomplice
whom
i
accuse
them
of
having
and
of
the
connection
between
the
two
cases
they
reached
the
esplanade
in
front
of
the
hauville
chalets
with
the
capstans
by
which
the
fishermen
haul
up
their
boats
to
the
beach
a
number
of
inquisitive
persons
were
standing
outside
the
door
of
one
of
the
chalets
two
coastguards
posted
at
the
door
prevented
them
from
entering
the
mayor
shouldered
his
way
eagerly
through
the
crowd
he
was
back
from
the
where
he
had
been
telephoning
to
le
havre
to
the
office
of
the
and
had
been
told
that
the
public
prosecutor
and
an
would
come
on
to
étretat
in
the
course
of
the
afternoon
that
leaves
us
plenty
of
time
for
lunch
said
rénine
the
tragedy
will
not
be
enacted
before
two
or
three
and
i
have
an
idea
that
it
will
be
sensational
they
hurried
nevertheless
hortense
overwrought
by
fatigue
and
her
desire
to
know
what
was
happening
continually
questioned
rénine
who
replied
evasively
with
his
eyes
turned
to
the
esplanade
which
they
could
see
through
the
windows
of
the
are
you
watching
for
those
two
asked
hortense
yes
the
brother
and
sister
are
you
sure
that
they
will
venture
look
out
here
they
come
he
went
out
quickly
where
the
main
street
opened
on
the
a
lady
and
gentleman
were
advancing
with
hesitating
steps
as
though
unfamiliar
with
the
place
the
brother
was
a
puny
little
man
with
a
sallow
complexion
he
was
wearing
a
the
sister
too
was
short
but
rather
stout
and
was
wrapped
in
a
large
cloak
she
struck
them
as
a
woman
of
a
certain
age
but
still
under
the
thin
veil
that
covered
her
face
they
saw
the
groups
of
bystanders
and
drew
nearer
their
gait
betrayed
uneasiness
and
hesitation
the
sister
asked
a
question
of
a
seaman
at
the
first
words
of
his
answer
which
no
doubt
conveyed
the
news
of
death
she
uttered
a
cry
and
tried
to
force
her
way
through
the
crowd
the
brother
learning
in
his
turn
what
had
happened
made
great
play
with
his
elbows
and
shouted
to
the
i
a
friend
of
here
my
card
frédéric
astaing
my
sister
germaine
astaing
knows
madame
intimately
they
were
expecting
us
we
had
an
appointment
they
were
allowed
to
pass
rénine
who
had
slipped
behind
them
followed
them
in
without
a
word
accompanied
by
hortense
the
had
four
bedrooms
and
a
on
the
second
floor
the
sister
rushed
into
one
of
the
rooms
and
threw
herself
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
on
which
the
corpse
lay
stretched
thérèse
was
in
the
and
was
sobbing
in
the
midst
of
a
small
company
of
silent
persons
the
brother
sat
down
beside
her
eagerly
seized
her
hands
and
said
in
a
trembling
voice
my
poor
friend
my
poor
friend
rénine
and
hortense
gazed
at
the
pair
of
them
and
hortense
whispered
and
she
supposed
to
have
killed
him
for
that
impossible
nevertheless
observed
rénine
they
are
acquaintances
and
we
know
that
astaing
and
his
sister
were
also
acquainted
with
a
third
person
who
was
their
accomplice
so
that
it
impossible
hortense
repeated
and
in
spite
of
all
presumption
she
felt
so
much
attracted
by
thérèse
that
when
frédéric
astaing
stood
up
she
proceeded
straightway
to
sit
down
beside
her
and
consoled
her
in
a
gentle
voice
the
unhappy
woman
tears
distressed
her
profoundly
rénine
on
the
other
hand
applied
himself
from
the
outset
to
watching
the
brother
and
sister
as
though
this
were
the
only
thing
that
mattered
and
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
frédéric
astaing
who
with
an
air
of
indifference
began
to
make
a
minute
inspection
of
the
premises
examining
the
going
into
all
the
bedrooms
mingling
with
the
various
groups
of
persons
present
and
asking
questions
about
the
manner
in
which
the
murder
had
been
committed
twice
his
sister
came
up
and
spoke
to
him
then
he
went
back
to
madame
and
again
sat
down
beside
her
full
of
earnest
sympathy
lastly
in
the
lobby
he
had
a
long
conversation
with
his
sister
after
which
they
parted
like
people
who
have
come
to
a
perfect
understanding
frédéric
then
left
these
manoeuvers
had
lasted
quite
thirty
or
forty
minutes
it
was
at
this
moment
that
the
containing
the
and
the
public
prosecutor
pulled
up
outside
the
chalets
rénine
who
did
not
expect
them
until
later
said
to
hortense
we
must
be
quick
on
no
account
leave
madame
word
was
sent
up
to
the
persons
whose
evidence
might
be
of
any
service
that
they
were
to
go
to
the
beach
where
the
magistrate
was
beginning
a
preliminary
investigation
he
would
call
on
madame
afterwards
accordingly
all
who
were
present
left
the
chalet
no
one
remained
behind
except
the
two
guards
and
germaine
astaing
germaine
knelt
down
for
the
last
time
beside
the
dead
man
and
bending
low
with
her
face
in
her
hands
prayed
for
a
long
time
then
she
rose
and
was
opening
the
door
on
the
landing
when
rénine
came
forward
i
should
like
a
few
words
with
you
madame
she
seemed
surprised
and
replied
what
is
it
monsieur
i
am
listening
not
here
where
then
monsieur
next
door
in
the
no
she
said
sharply
why
not
though
you
did
not
even
shake
hands
with
her
i
presume
that
madame
is
your
friend
he
gave
her
no
time
to
reflect
drew
her
into
the
next
room
closed
the
door
and
at
once
pouncing
upon
madame
who
was
trying
to
go
out
and
return
to
her
own
room
said
no
madame
listen
i
implore
you
madame
astaing
presence
need
not
drive
you
away
we
have
very
serious
matters
to
discuss
without
losing
a
minute
the
two
women
standing
face
to
face
were
looking
at
each
other
with
the
same
expression
of
implacable
hatred
in
which
might
be
read
the
same
confusion
of
spirit
and
the
same
restrained
anger
hortense
who
believed
them
to
be
friends
and
who
might
up
to
a
certain
point
have
believed
them
to
be
accomplices
foresaw
with
terror
the
hostile
encounter
which
she
felt
to
be
inevitable
she
compelled
madame
to
resume
her
seat
while
rénine
took
up
his
position
in
the
middle
of
the
room
and
spoke
in
resolute
tones
chance
which
has
placed
me
in
possession
of
part
of
the
truth
will
enable
me
to
save
you
both
if
you
are
willing
to
assist
me
with
a
frank
explanation
that
will
give
me
the
particulars
which
i
still
need
each
of
you
knows
the
danger
in
which
she
stands
because
each
of
you
is
conscious
in
her
heart
of
the
evil
for
which
she
is
responsible
but
you
are
carried
away
by
hatred
and
it
is
for
me
to
see
clearly
and
to
act
the
will
be
here
in
by
that
time
you
must
have
come
to
an
agreement
they
both
started
as
though
offended
by
such
a
word
yes
an
agreement
he
repeated
in
a
more
imperious
tone
whether
you
like
it
or
not
you
will
come
to
an
agreement
you
are
not
the
only
ones
to
be
considered
there
are
your
two
little
daughters
madame
since
circumstances
have
set
me
in
their
path
i
am
intervening
in
their
defence
and
for
their
safety
a
blunder
a
word
too
much
and
they
are
ruined
that
must
not
happen
at
the
mention
of
her
children
madame
broke
down
and
sobbed
germaine
astaing
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
made
a
movement
towards
the
door
rénine
once
more
blocked
the
way
where
are
you
going
i
have
been
summoned
by
the
no
you
have
not
yes
i
have
just
as
all
those
have
been
who
have
any
evidence
to
give
you
were
not
on
the
spot
you
know
nothing
of
what
happened
nobody
knows
anything
of
the
murder
i
know
who
committed
it
that
impossible
it
was
thérèse
the
accusation
was
hurled
forth
in
an
outburst
of
rage
and
with
a
fiercely
threatening
gesture
you
wretched
creature
exclaimed
madame
rushing
at
her
go
leave
the
room
oh
what
a
wretch
the
woman
is
hortense
was
trying
to
restrain
her
but
rénine
whispered
let
them
be
it
what
i
wanted
to
pitch
them
one
against
the
other
and
so
to
let
in
the
madame
astaing
had
made
a
convulsive
effort
to
ward
off
the
insult
with
a
jest
and
she
sniggered
a
wretched
creature
why
because
i
have
accused
you
why
for
every
reason
you
a
wretched
creature
you
hear
what
i
say
germaine
you
a
wretch
thérèse
was
repeating
the
insult
as
though
it
afforded
her
some
relief
her
anger
was
abating
very
likely
also
she
no
longer
had
the
strength
to
keep
up
the
struggle
and
it
was
madame
astaing
who
returned
to
the
attack
with
her
fists
clenched
and
her
face
distorted
and
suddenly
aged
by
fully
twenty
years
you
you
dare
to
insult
me
you
you
after
the
murder
you
have
committed
you
dare
to
lift
up
your
head
when
the
man
whom
you
killed
is
lying
in
there
on
his
ah
if
one
of
us
is
a
wretched
creature
it
you
thérèse
and
you
know
it
you
have
killed
your
husband
you
have
killed
your
husband
she
leapt
forward
in
the
excitement
of
the
terrible
words
which
she
was
uttering
and
her
were
almost
touching
her
friend
face
oh
do
tell
me
you
did
kill
him
she
cried
do
say
that
i
wo
let
you
do
say
it
the
dagger
is
there
in
your
bag
my
brother
felt
it
while
he
was
talking
to
you
and
his
hand
came
out
with
stains
of
blood
upon
it
your
husband
blood
thérèse
and
then
even
if
i
had
not
discovered
anything
do
you
think
that
i
should
not
have
guessed
in
the
first
few
minutes
why
i
knew
the
truth
at
once
thérèse
when
a
sailor
down
there
answered
he
has
been
murdered
i
said
to
myself
then
and
there
she
it
thérèse
she
killed
him
thérèse
did
not
reply
she
had
abandoned
her
attitude
of
protest
hortense
who
was
watching
her
with
anguish
thought
that
she
could
perceive
in
her
the
despondency
of
those
who
know
themselves
to
be
lost
her
cheeks
had
fallen
in
and
she
wore
such
an
expression
of
despair
that
hortense
moved
to
compassion
implored
her
to
defend
herself
please
please
explain
things
when
the
murder
was
committed
you
were
here
on
the
balcony
but
then
the
dagger
how
did
you
come
to
have
it
how
do
you
explain
it
explanations
sneered
germaine
astaing
how
could
she
possibly
explain
what
do
outward
appearances
matter
what
does
it
matter
what
any
one
saw
or
did
not
see
the
proof
is
the
thing
that
tells
the
dagger
is
there
in
your
bag
thérèse
that
a
fact
yes
yes
it
was
you
who
did
it
you
killed
him
you
killed
him
in
the
end
ah
how
often
i
told
my
brother
will
kill
him
yet
frédéric
used
to
try
to
defend
you
he
always
had
a
weakness
for
you
but
in
his
innermost
heart
he
foresaw
what
would
happen
and
now
the
horrible
thing
has
been
done
a
stab
in
the
back
coward
coward
and
you
would
have
me
say
nothing
why
i
hesitate
a
moment
nor
did
frédéric
we
looked
for
proofs
at
once
and
i
denounced
you
of
my
own
free
will
perfectly
well
aware
of
what
i
was
doing
and
it
over
thérèse
you
done
for
nothing
can
save
you
now
the
dagger
is
in
that
bag
which
you
are
clutching
in
your
hand
the
magistrate
is
coming
and
the
dagger
will
be
found
stained
with
the
blood
of
your
husband
so
will
your
they
both
there
and
they
will
be
found
her
rage
had
incensed
her
so
vehemently
that
she
was
unable
to
continue
and
stood
with
her
hand
outstretched
and
her
chin
twitching
with
nervous
tremors
rénine
gently
took
hold
of
madame
bag
she
clung
to
it
but
he
insisted
and
said
please
allow
me
madame
your
friend
germaine
is
right
the
will
be
here
presently
and
the
fact
that
the
dagger
and
the
are
in
your
possession
will
lead
to
your
immediate
arrest
this
must
not
happen
please
allow
me
his
insinuating
voice
diminished
thérèse
resistance
she
released
her
fingers
one
by
one
he
took
the
bag
opened
it
produced
a
little
dagger
with
an
ebony
handle
and
a
grey
leather
and
quietly
slipped
the
two
into
the
inside
pocket
of
his
jacket
germaine
astaing
gazed
at
him
in
amazement
you
mad
monsieur
what
right
have
you
these
things
must
not
be
left
lying
about
i
worry
now
the
magistrate
will
never
look
for
them
in
my
pocket
but
i
shall
denounce
you
to
the
police
she
exclaimed
indignantly
they
shall
be
told
no
no
he
said
laughing
you
wo
say
anything
the
police
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
the
quarrel
between
you
must
be
settled
in
private
what
an
idea
to
go
dragging
the
police
into
every
incident
of
one
life
madame
astaing
was
choking
with
fury
but
you
have
no
right
to
talk
like
this
monsieur
who
are
you
after
all
a
friend
of
that
woman
since
you
have
been
attacking
her
yes
but
i
only
attacking
her
because
she
guilty
for
you
ca
deny
it
she
has
killed
her
husband
i
do
deny
it
said
rénine
calmly
we
are
all
agreed
on
that
point
jacques
was
killed
by
his
wife
but
i
repeat
the
police
must
not
know
the
truth
they
shall
know
it
through
me
monsieur
i
swear
they
shall
that
woman
must
be
punished
she
has
committed
murder
rénine
went
up
to
her
and
touching
her
on
the
shoulder
you
asked
me
just
now
by
what
right
i
was
interfering
and
you
yourself
madame
i
was
a
friend
of
jacques
only
a
friend
she
was
a
little
taken
aback
but
at
once
pulled
herself
together
and
replied
i
was
his
friend
and
it
is
my
duty
to
avenge
his
death
nevertheless
you
will
remain
silent
as
he
did
he
did
not
know
when
he
died
that
where
you
are
wrong
he
could
have
accused
his
wife
if
he
had
wished
he
had
ample
time
to
accuse
her
and
he
said
nothing
why
because
of
his
children
madame
astaing
was
not
appeased
and
her
attitude
displayed
the
same
longing
for
revenge
and
the
same
detestation
but
she
was
influenced
by
rénine
in
spite
of
herself
in
the
small
closed
room
where
there
was
such
a
clash
of
hatred
he
was
gradually
becoming
the
master
and
germaine
astaing
understood
that
it
was
against
him
that
she
had
to
struggle
while
madame
felt
all
the
comfort
of
that
unexpected
support
which
was
offering
itself
on
the
brink
of
the
abyss
thank
you
monsieur
she
said
as
you
have
seen
all
this
so
clearly
you
also
know
that
it
was
for
my
children
sake
that
i
did
not
give
myself
up
but
for
that
i
am
so
tired
and
so
the
scene
was
changing
and
things
assuming
a
different
aspect
thanks
to
a
few
words
let
fall
in
the
midst
of
the
dispute
the
culprit
was
lifting
her
head
and
taking
heart
whereas
her
accuser
was
hesitating
and
seemed
to
be
uneasy
and
it
also
came
about
that
the
accuser
dared
not
say
anything
further
and
that
the
culprit
was
nearing
the
moment
at
which
the
need
is
felt
of
breaking
silence
and
of
speaking
quite
naturally
words
that
are
at
once
a
confession
and
a
relief
the
time
i
think
has
come
said
rénine
to
thérèse
with
the
same
unvarying
gentleness
when
you
can
and
ought
to
explain
yourself
she
was
again
weeping
lying
huddled
in
a
chair
she
too
revealed
a
face
aged
and
ravaged
by
sorrow
and
in
a
very
low
voice
with
no
display
of
anger
she
spoke
in
short
broken
sentences
she
has
been
his
mistress
for
the
last
four
years
i
ca
tell
you
how
i
suffered
she
herself
told
me
of
it
out
of
sheer
wickedness
her
loathing
for
me
was
even
greater
than
her
love
for
jacques
and
every
day
i
had
some
fresh
injury
to
bear
she
would
ring
me
up
to
tell
me
of
her
appointments
with
my
husband
she
hoped
to
make
me
suffer
so
much
i
should
end
by
killing
myself
i
did
think
of
it
sometimes
but
i
held
out
for
the
children
sake
jacques
was
weakening
she
wanted
him
to
get
a
divorce
and
little
by
little
he
began
to
consent
dominated
by
her
and
by
her
brother
who
is
slyer
than
she
is
but
quite
as
dangerous
i
felt
all
this
jacques
was
becoming
harsh
to
me
he
had
not
the
courage
to
leave
me
but
i
was
the
obstacle
and
he
bore
me
a
grudge
heavens
the
tortures
i
suffered
you
should
have
given
him
his
liberty
cried
germaine
astaing
a
woman
does
kill
her
husband
for
wanting
a
divorce
thérèse
shook
her
head
and
answered
i
did
not
kill
him
because
he
wanted
a
divorce
if
he
had
really
wanted
it
he
would
have
left
me
and
what
could
i
have
done
but
your
plans
had
changed
germaine
divorce
was
not
enough
for
you
and
it
was
something
else
that
you
would
have
obtained
from
him
another
much
more
serious
thing
which
you
and
your
brother
had
insisted
on
and
to
which
he
had
consented
out
of
cowardice
in
spite
of
himself
what
do
you
mean
spluttered
germaine
what
other
thing
my
death
you
lie
cried
madame
astaing
thérèse
did
not
raise
her
voice
she
made
not
a
movement
of
aversion
or
indignation
and
simply
repeated
my
death
germaine
i
have
read
your
latest
letters
six
letters
from
you
which
he
was
foolish
enough
to
leave
about
in
his
and
which
i
read
last
night
six
letters
in
which
the
terrible
word
is
not
set
down
but
in
which
it
appears
between
every
line
i
trembled
as
i
read
it
that
jacques
should
come
to
this
nevertheless
the
idea
of
stabbing
him
did
not
occur
to
me
for
a
second
a
woman
like
myself
germaine
does
not
readily
commit
murder
if
i
lost
my
head
it
was
after
that
and
it
was
your
fault
she
turned
her
eyes
to
rénine
as
if
to
ask
him
if
there
was
no
danger
in
her
speaking
and
revealing
the
truth
do
be
afraid
he
said
i
will
be
answerable
for
everything
she
drew
her
hand
across
her
forehead
the
horrible
scene
was
being
reenacted
within
her
and
was
torturing
her
germaine
astaing
did
not
move
but
stood
with
folded
arms
and
anxious
eyes
while
hortense
daniel
sat
distractedly
awaiting
the
confession
of
the
crime
and
the
explanation
of
the
unfathomable
mystery
it
was
after
that
and
it
was
through
your
fault
germaine
i
had
put
back
the
in
the
drawer
where
it
was
hidden
and
i
said
nothing
to
jacques
this
morning
i
did
not
want
to
tell
him
what
i
knew
it
was
too
horrible
all
the
same
i
had
to
act
quickly
your
letters
announced
your
secret
arrival
i
thought
at
first
of
running
away
of
taking
the
train
i
had
mechanically
picked
up
that
dagger
to
defend
myself
but
when
jacques
and
i
went
down
to
the
beach
i
was
resigned
yes
i
had
accepted
death
will
die
i
thought
put
an
end
to
all
this
nightmare
only
for
the
children
sake
i
was
anxious
that
my
death
should
look
like
an
accident
and
that
jacques
should
have
no
part
in
it
that
was
why
your
plan
of
a
walk
on
the
cliff
suited
me
a
fall
from
the
top
of
a
cliff
seems
quite
natural
jacques
therefore
left
me
to
go
to
his
cabin
from
which
he
was
to
join
you
later
at
the
trois
mathildes
on
the
way
below
the
terrace
he
dropped
the
key
of
the
cabin
i
went
down
and
began
to
look
for
it
with
him
and
it
happened
then
through
your
fault
yes
germaine
through
your
fault
jacques
had
slipped
from
his
jacket
without
his
noticing
it
and
together
with
the
a
photograph
which
i
recognized
at
once
a
photograph
taken
this
year
of
myself
and
my
two
children
i
picked
it
up
and
i
saw
you
know
what
i
saw
germaine
instead
of
my
face
the
face
in
the
photograph
was
you
had
put
in
your
likeness
germaine
and
blotted
me
out
it
was
your
face
one
of
your
arms
was
round
my
elder
daughter
neck
and
the
younger
was
sitting
on
your
knees
it
was
you
germaine
the
wife
of
my
husband
the
future
mother
of
my
children
you
who
were
going
to
bring
them
up
you
you
then
i
lost
my
head
i
had
the
dagger
jacques
was
stooping
i
stabbed
him
every
word
of
her
confession
was
strictly
true
those
who
listened
to
her
felt
this
profoundly
and
nothing
could
have
given
hortense
and
rénine
a
keener
impression
of
tragedy
she
had
fallen
back
into
her
chair
utterly
exhausted
nevertheless
she
went
on
speaking
unintelligible
words
and
it
was
only
gradually
by
leaning
over
her
that
they
were
able
to
make
out
i
thought
that
there
would
be
an
outcry
and
that
i
should
be
arrested
but
no
it
happened
in
such
a
way
and
under
such
conditions
that
no
one
had
seen
anything
further
jacques
had
drawn
himself
up
at
the
same
time
as
myself
and
he
actually
did
not
fall
no
he
did
not
fall
i
had
stabbed
him
and
he
remained
standing
i
saw
him
from
the
terrace
to
which
i
had
returned
he
had
hung
his
jacket
over
his
shoulders
evidently
to
hide
his
wound
and
he
moved
away
without
staggering
or
staggering
so
little
that
i
alone
was
able
to
perceive
it
he
even
spoke
to
some
friends
who
were
playing
cards
then
he
went
to
his
cabin
and
disappeared
in
a
few
moments
i
came
back
indoors
i
was
persuaded
that
all
of
this
was
only
a
bad
dream
that
i
had
not
killed
him
or
that
at
the
worst
the
wound
was
a
slight
one
jacques
would
come
out
again
i
was
certain
of
it
i
watched
from
my
balcony
if
i
had
thought
for
a
moment
that
he
needed
assistance
i
should
have
flown
to
him
but
truly
i
did
know
i
did
guess
people
speak
of
presentiments
there
are
no
such
things
i
was
perfectly
calm
just
as
one
is
after
a
nightmare
of
which
the
memory
is
fading
away
no
i
swear
to
you
i
knew
nothing
until
the
moment
she
interrupted
herself
stifled
by
sobs
rénine
finished
her
sentence
for
her
until
the
moment
when
they
came
and
told
you
i
suppose
thérèse
stammered
yes
it
was
not
till
then
that
i
was
conscious
of
what
i
had
done
and
i
felt
that
i
was
going
mad
and
that
i
should
cry
out
to
all
those
people
it
was
i
who
did
it
do
search
here
is
the
dagger
i
am
the
culprit
yes
i
was
going
to
say
that
when
suddenly
i
caught
sight
of
my
poor
jacques
they
were
carrying
him
along
his
face
was
very
peaceful
very
gentle
and
in
his
presence
i
understood
my
duty
as
he
had
understood
his
he
had
kept
silent
for
the
sake
of
the
children
i
would
be
silent
too
we
were
both
guilty
of
the
murder
of
which
he
was
the
victim
and
we
must
both
do
all
we
could
to
prevent
the
crime
from
recoiling
upon
them
he
had
seen
this
clearly
in
his
dying
agony
he
had
had
the
amazing
courage
to
keep
his
feet
to
answer
the
people
who
spoke
to
him
and
to
lock
himself
up
to
die
he
had
done
this
wiping
out
all
his
faults
with
a
single
action
and
in
so
doing
had
granted
me
his
forgiveness
because
he
was
not
accusing
me
and
was
ordering
me
to
hold
my
peace
and
to
defend
myself
against
everybody
especially
against
you
germaine
she
uttered
these
last
words
more
firmly
at
first
wholly
overwhelmed
by
the
unconscious
act
which
she
had
committed
in
killing
her
husband
she
had
recovered
her
strength
a
little
in
thinking
of
what
she
had
done
and
in
defending
herself
with
such
energy
faced
by
the
intriguing
woman
whose
hatred
had
driven
both
of
them
to
death
and
crime
she
clenched
her
fists
ready
for
the
struggle
all
quivering
with
resolution
germaine
astaing
did
not
flinch
she
had
listened
without
a
word
with
a
relentless
expression
which
grew
harder
and
harder
as
thérèse
confessions
became
precise
no
emotion
seemed
to
soften
her
and
no
remorse
to
penetrate
her
being
at
most
towards
the
end
her
thin
lips
shaped
themselves
into
a
faint
smile
she
was
holding
her
prey
in
her
clutches
slowly
with
her
eyes
raised
to
a
mirror
she
adjusted
her
hat
and
powdered
her
face
then
she
walked
to
the
door
thérèse
darted
forward
where
are
you
going
where
i
choose
to
see
the
very
likely
you
pass
as
you
please
i
wait
for
him
here
and
you
tell
him
what
why
all
that
you
said
of
course
all
that
you
been
silly
enough
to
say
how
could
he
doubt
the
story
you
have
explained
it
all
to
me
so
fully
thérèse
took
her
by
the
shoulders
yes
but
i
explain
other
things
to
him
at
the
same
time
germaine
things
that
concern
you
if
i
ruined
so
shall
you
be
you
ca
touch
me
i
can
expose
you
show
your
letters
what
letters
those
in
which
my
death
was
decided
on
lies
thérèse
you
know
that
famous
plot
exists
only
in
your
imagination
neither
jacques
nor
i
wished
for
your
death
you
did
at
any
rate
your
letters
condemn
you
lies
they
were
the
letters
of
a
friend
to
a
friend
letters
of
a
mistress
to
her
paramour
prove
it
they
are
there
in
jacques
no
they
not
what
that
you
say
i
say
that
those
letters
belonged
to
me
i
taken
them
back
or
rather
my
brother
has
you
stolen
them
you
wretch
and
you
shall
give
them
back
again
cried
thérèse
shaking
her
i
have
them
my
brother
kept
them
he
has
gone
thérèse
staggered
and
stretched
out
her
hands
to
rénine
with
an
expression
of
despair
rénine
said
what
she
says
is
true
i
watched
the
brother
proceedings
while
he
was
feeling
in
your
bag
he
took
out
the
looked
through
it
with
his
sister
came
and
put
it
back
again
and
went
off
with
the
letters
rénine
paused
and
added
or
at
least
with
five
of
them
the
two
women
moved
closer
to
him
what
did
he
intend
to
convey
if
frédéric
astaing
had
taken
away
only
five
letters
what
had
become
of
the
sixth
i
suppose
said
rénine
that
when
the
fell
on
the
shingle
that
sixth
letter
slipped
out
at
the
same
time
as
the
photograph
and
that
must
have
picked
it
up
for
i
found
it
in
the
pocket
of
his
blazer
which
had
been
hung
up
near
the
bed
here
it
is
it
signed
germaine
astaing
and
it
is
quite
enough
to
prove
the
writer
intentions
and
the
murderous
counsels
which
she
was
pressing
upon
her
lover
madame
astaing
had
turned
grey
in
the
face
and
was
so
much
disconcerted
that
she
did
not
try
to
defend
herself
rénine
continued
addressing
his
remarks
to
her
to
my
mind
madame
you
are
responsible
for
all
that
happened
penniless
no
doubt
and
at
the
end
of
your
resources
you
tried
to
profit
by
the
passion
with
which
you
inspired
in
order
to
make
him
marry
you
in
spite
of
all
the
obstacles
and
to
lay
your
hands
upon
his
fortune
i
have
proofs
of
this
greed
for
money
and
these
abominable
calculations
and
can
supply
them
if
need
be
a
few
minutes
after
i
had
felt
in
the
pocket
of
that
jacket
you
did
the
same
i
had
removed
the
sixth
letter
but
had
left
a
slip
of
paper
which
you
looked
for
eagerly
and
which
also
must
have
dropped
out
of
the
it
was
an
uncrossed
cheque
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
drawn
by
in
your
brother
name
just
a
little
what
we
might
call
acting
on
your
instructions
your
brother
dashed
off
by
motor
to
le
havre
to
reach
the
bank
before
four
i
may
as
well
tell
you
that
he
will
not
have
cashed
the
cheque
for
i
had
a
sent
to
the
bank
to
announce
the
murder
of
which
stops
all
payments
the
upshot
of
all
this
is
that
the
police
if
you
persist
in
your
schemes
of
revenge
will
have
in
their
hands
all
the
proofs
that
are
wanted
against
you
and
your
brother
i
might
add
as
an
edifying
piece
of
evidence
the
story
of
the
conversation
which
i
overheard
between
your
brother
and
yourself
in
a
on
the
railway
between
brest
and
paris
a
fortnight
ago
but
i
feel
sure
that
you
will
not
drive
me
to
adopt
these
extreme
measures
and
that
we
understand
each
other
is
that
so
natures
like
madame
astaing
which
are
violent
and
headstrong
so
long
as
a
fight
is
possible
and
while
a
gleam
of
hope
remains
are
easily
swayed
in
defeat
germaine
was
too
intelligent
not
to
grasp
the
fact
that
the
least
attempt
at
resistance
would
be
shattered
by
such
an
adversary
as
this
she
was
in
his
hands
she
could
but
yield
she
therefore
did
not
indulge
in
any
nor
in
any
demonstration
such
as
threats
outbursts
of
fury
or
hysterics
she
bowed
we
are
agreed
she
said
what
are
your
terms
go
away
if
ever
you
are
called
upon
for
your
evidence
say
that
you
know
nothing
she
walked
away
at
the
door
she
hesitated
and
then
between
her
teeth
said
the
cheque
rénine
looked
at
madame
who
declared
let
her
keep
it
i
would
not
touch
that
money
when
rénine
had
given
thérèse
precise
instructions
as
to
how
she
was
to
behave
at
the
enquiry
and
to
answer
the
questions
put
to
her
he
left
the
chalet
accompanied
by
hortense
daniel
on
the
beach
below
the
magistrate
and
the
public
prosecutor
were
continuing
their
investigations
taking
measurements
examining
the
witnesses
and
generally
laying
their
heads
together
when
i
think
said
hortense
that
you
have
the
dagger
and
on
you
and
it
strikes
you
as
awfully
dangerous
i
suppose
he
said
laughing
it
strikes
as
awfully
comic
are
you
afraid
of
what
that
they
may
suspect
something
lord
they
wo
suspect
a
thing
we
shall
tell
those
good
people
what
we
saw
and
our
evidence
will
only
increase
their
perplexity
for
we
saw
nothing
at
all
for
prudence
sake
we
will
stay
a
day
or
two
to
see
which
way
the
wind
is
blowing
but
it
quite
settled
they
will
never
be
able
to
make
head
or
tail
of
the
matter
nevertheless
guessed
the
secret
and
from
the
first
why
because
instead
of
seeking
difficulties
where
none
exist
as
people
generally
do
i
always
put
the
question
as
it
should
be
put
and
the
solution
comes
quite
naturally
a
man
goes
to
his
cabin
and
locks
himself
in
half
an
hour
later
he
is
found
inside
dead
no
one
has
gone
in
what
has
happened
to
my
mind
there
is
only
one
answer
there
is
no
need
to
think
about
it
as
the
murder
was
not
committed
in
the
cabin
it
must
have
been
committed
beforehand
and
the
man
was
already
mortally
wounded
when
he
entered
his
cabin
and
forthwith
the
truth
in
this
particular
case
appeared
to
me
madame
who
was
to
have
been
killed
this
evening
forestalled
her
murderers
and
while
her
husband
was
stooping
to
the
ground
in
a
moment
of
frenzy
stabbed
him
in
the
back
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
but
look
for
the
reasons
that
prompted
her
action
when
i
knew
them
i
took
her
part
unreservedly
that
the
whole
story
the
day
was
beginning
to
wane
the
blue
of
the
sky
was
becoming
darker
and
the
sea
even
more
peaceful
than
before
what
are
you
thinking
of
asked
rénine
after
a
moment
i
am
thinking
she
said
that
if
i
too
were
the
victim
of
some
machination
i
should
trust
you
whatever
happened
trust
you
through
and
against
all
i
know
as
certainly
as
i
know
that
i
exist
that
you
would
save
me
whatever
the
obstacles
might
be
there
is
no
limit
to
the
power
of
your
will
he
said
very
softly
there
is
no
limit
to
my
wish
to
please
you
vi
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
one
of
the
most
incomprehensible
incidents
that
preceded
the
great
war
was
certainly
the
one
which
was
known
as
the
episode
of
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
the
solution
of
the
mystery
was
unknown
and
would
never
have
been
known
had
not
circumstances
in
the
cruellest
fashion
obliged
prince
rénine
or
should
i
say
arsène
lupin
to
take
up
the
matter
and
had
i
not
been
able
to
tell
the
true
story
from
the
details
supplied
by
him
let
me
recite
the
facts
in
a
space
of
eighteen
months
five
women
disappeared
five
women
of
different
stations
in
life
all
between
twenty
and
thirty
years
of
age
and
living
in
paris
or
the
paris
district
i
will
give
their
names
madame
ladoue
the
wife
of
a
doctor
mlle
ardant
the
daughter
of
a
banker
mlle
covereau
a
of
courbevoie
mlle
honorine
vernisset
a
dressmaker
and
madame
grollinger
an
artist
these
five
women
disappeared
without
the
possibility
of
discovering
a
single
particular
to
explain
why
they
had
left
their
homes
why
they
did
not
return
to
them
who
had
enticed
them
away
and
where
and
how
they
were
detained
each
of
these
women
a
week
after
her
departure
was
found
somewhere
or
other
in
the
western
outskirts
of
paris
and
each
time
it
was
a
dead
body
that
was
found
the
dead
body
of
a
woman
who
had
been
killed
by
a
blow
on
the
head
from
a
hatchet
and
each
time
not
far
from
the
woman
who
was
firmly
bound
her
face
covered
with
blood
and
her
body
emaciated
by
lack
of
food
the
marks
of
proved
that
the
corpse
had
been
driven
to
the
spot
the
five
murders
were
so
much
alike
that
there
was
only
a
single
investigation
embracing
all
the
five
enquiries
and
for
that
matter
leading
to
no
result
a
woman
disappeared
a
week
later
to
a
day
her
body
was
discovered
and
that
was
all
the
bonds
that
fastened
her
were
similar
in
each
case
so
were
the
tracks
left
by
the
wheels
so
were
the
blows
of
the
hatchet
all
of
which
were
struck
vertically
at
the
top
and
right
in
the
middle
of
the
forehead
the
motive
of
the
crime
the
five
women
had
been
completely
stripped
of
their
jewels
purses
and
other
objects
of
value
but
the
robberies
might
well
have
been
attributed
to
marauders
or
any
passersby
since
the
bodies
were
lying
in
deserted
spots
were
the
authorities
to
believe
in
the
execution
of
a
plan
of
revenge
or
of
a
plan
intended
to
do
away
with
the
series
of
persons
mutually
connected
persons
for
instance
likely
to
benefit
by
a
future
inheritance
here
again
the
same
obscurity
prevailed
theories
were
built
up
only
to
be
demolished
forthwith
by
an
examination
of
the
facts
trails
were
followed
and
at
once
abandoned
and
suddenly
there
was
a
sensation
a
woman
engaged
in
sweeping
the
roads
picked
up
on
the
pavement
a
little
which
she
brought
to
the
local
the
leaves
of
this
were
all
blank
excepting
one
on
which
was
written
a
list
of
the
murdered
women
with
their
names
set
down
in
order
of
date
and
accompanied
by
three
figures
ladoue
vernisset
and
so
on
certainly
no
importance
would
have
been
attached
to
these
entries
which
anybody
might
have
written
since
every
one
was
acquainted
with
the
sinister
list
but
instead
of
five
names
it
included
six
yes
below
the
words
grollinger
there
appeared
williamson
did
this
indicate
a
sixth
murder
the
obviously
english
origin
of
the
name
limited
the
field
of
the
investigations
which
did
not
in
fact
take
long
it
was
ascertained
that
a
fortnight
ago
a
miss
hermione
williamson
a
governess
in
a
family
at
auteuil
had
left
her
place
to
go
back
to
england
and
that
since
then
her
sisters
though
she
had
written
to
tell
them
that
she
was
coming
over
had
heard
no
more
of
her
a
fresh
enquiry
was
instituted
a
postman
found
the
body
in
the
meudon
woods
miss
williamson
skull
was
split
down
the
middle
i
need
not
describe
the
public
excitement
at
this
stage
nor
the
shudder
of
horror
which
passed
through
the
crowd
when
it
read
this
list
written
without
a
doubt
in
the
murderer
own
hand
what
could
be
more
frightful
than
such
a
record
kept
up
to
date
like
a
careful
tradesman
ledger
on
such
a
day
i
killed
on
such
a
day
and
the
sum
total
was
six
dead
bodies
against
all
expectation
the
experts
in
handwriting
had
no
difficulty
in
agreeing
and
unanimously
declared
that
the
writing
was
that
of
a
woman
an
educated
woman
possessing
artistic
tastes
imagination
and
an
extremely
sensitive
nature
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
as
the
journalists
christened
her
was
decidedly
no
ordinary
person
and
scores
of
made
a
special
study
of
her
case
exposing
her
mental
condition
and
losing
themselves
in
explanations
nevertheless
it
was
the
writer
of
one
of
these
articles
a
young
journalist
whose
chance
discovery
made
him
the
centre
of
public
attention
who
supplied
the
one
element
of
truth
and
shed
upon
the
darkness
the
only
ray
of
light
that
was
to
penetrate
it
in
casting
about
for
the
meaning
of
the
figures
which
followed
the
six
names
he
had
come
to
ask
himself
whether
those
figures
did
not
simply
represent
the
number
of
the
days
separating
one
crime
from
the
next
all
that
he
had
to
do
was
to
check
the
dates
he
at
once
found
that
his
theory
was
correct
mlle
vernisset
had
been
carried
off
one
hundred
and
days
after
madame
ladoue
mlle
covereau
one
hundred
and
eighteen
days
after
honorine
vernisset
and
so
on
there
was
therefore
no
room
for
doubt
and
the
police
had
no
choice
but
to
accept
a
solution
which
so
precisely
fitted
the
circumstances
the
figures
corresponded
with
the
intervals
there
was
no
mistake
in
the
records
of
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
but
then
one
deduction
became
inevitable
miss
williamson
the
latest
victim
had
been
carried
off
on
the
of
june
last
and
her
name
was
followed
by
the
figures
was
it
not
to
be
presumed
that
a
fresh
crime
would
be
committed
a
hundred
and
fourteen
days
later
that
is
to
say
on
the
of
october
was
it
not
probable
that
the
horrible
business
would
be
repeated
in
accordance
with
the
murderer
secret
intentions
were
they
not
bound
to
pursue
to
its
logical
conclusion
the
argument
which
ascribed
to
the
figures
to
all
the
figures
to
the
last
as
well
as
to
the
others
their
value
as
eventual
dates
now
it
was
precisely
this
deduction
which
was
drawn
and
was
being
weighed
and
discussed
during
the
few
days
that
preceded
the
of
october
when
logic
demanded
the
performance
of
yet
another
act
of
the
abominable
tragedy
and
it
was
only
natural
that
on
the
morning
of
that
day
prince
rénine
and
hortense
when
making
an
appointment
by
telephone
for
the
evening
should
allude
to
the
which
they
had
both
been
reading
look
out
said
rénine
laughing
if
you
meet
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
take
the
other
side
of
the
road
and
if
the
good
lady
carries
me
off
what
am
i
to
do
strew
your
path
with
little
white
pebbles
and
say
until
the
very
moment
when
the
hatchet
flashes
in
the
air
have
nothing
to
fear
will
save
me
is
myself
and
i
kiss
your
hands
till
this
evening
my
dear
that
afternoon
rénine
had
an
appointment
with
rose
andrée
and
dalbrèque
to
arrange
for
their
departure
for
the
states
footnote
see
before
four
and
seven
he
bought
the
different
editions
of
the
evening
papers
none
of
them
reported
an
abduction
at
nine
he
went
to
the
gymnase
where
he
had
taken
a
private
box
at
nine
as
hortense
had
not
arrived
he
rang
her
up
though
without
thought
of
anxiety
the
maid
replied
that
madame
daniel
had
not
come
in
yet
seized
with
a
sudden
fear
rénine
hurried
to
the
furnished
flat
which
hortense
was
occupying
for
the
time
being
near
the
parc
monceau
and
questioned
the
maid
whom
he
had
engaged
for
her
and
who
was
completely
devoted
to
him
the
woman
said
that
her
mistress
had
gone
out
at
two
with
a
stamped
letter
in
her
hand
saying
that
she
was
going
to
the
post
and
that
she
would
come
back
to
dress
this
was
the
last
that
had
been
seen
of
her
to
whom
was
the
letter
addressed
to
you
sir
i
saw
the
writing
on
the
envelope
prince
serge
rénine
he
waited
until
midnight
but
in
vain
hortense
did
not
return
nor
did
she
return
next
day
not
a
word
to
any
one
said
rénine
to
the
maid
say
that
your
mistress
is
in
the
country
and
that
you
are
going
to
join
her
for
his
own
part
he
had
not
a
doubt
hortense
disappearance
was
explained
by
the
very
fact
of
the
date
the
of
october
she
was
the
seventh
victim
of
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
the
abduction
said
rénine
to
himself
precedes
the
blow
of
the
hatchet
by
a
week
i
have
therefore
at
the
present
moment
seven
full
days
before
me
let
us
say
six
to
avoid
any
surprise
this
is
saturday
hortense
must
be
set
free
by
on
friday
and
to
make
sure
of
this
i
must
know
her
by
nine
on
thursday
evening
at
latest
rénine
wrote
thursday
evening
nine
in
big
letters
on
a
card
which
he
nailed
above
the
mantelpiece
in
his
study
then
at
midday
on
saturday
the
day
after
the
disappearance
he
locked
himself
into
the
study
after
telling
his
man
not
to
disturb
him
except
for
meals
and
letters
he
spent
four
days
there
almost
without
moving
he
had
immediately
sent
for
a
set
of
all
the
leading
newspapers
which
had
spoken
in
detail
of
the
first
six
crimes
when
he
had
read
and
reread
them
he
closed
the
shutters
drew
the
curtains
and
lay
down
on
the
sofa
in
the
dark
with
the
door
bolted
thinking
by
tuesday
evening
he
was
no
further
advanced
than
on
the
saturday
the
darkness
was
as
dense
as
ever
he
had
not
discovered
the
smallest
clue
for
his
guidance
nor
could
he
see
the
slightest
reason
to
hope
at
times
notwithstanding
his
immense
power
of
and
his
unlimited
confidence
in
the
resources
at
his
disposal
at
times
he
would
quake
with
anguish
would
he
arrive
in
time
there
was
no
reason
why
he
should
see
more
clearly
during
the
last
few
days
than
during
those
which
had
already
elapsed
and
this
meant
that
hortense
daniel
would
inevitably
be
murdered
the
thought
tortured
him
he
was
attached
to
hortense
by
a
much
stronger
and
deeper
feeling
than
the
appearance
of
the
relations
between
them
would
have
led
an
onlooker
to
believe
the
curiosity
at
the
beginning
the
first
desire
the
impulse
to
protect
hortense
to
distract
her
to
inspire
her
with
a
relish
for
existence
all
this
had
simply
turned
to
love
neither
of
them
was
aware
of
it
because
they
barely
saw
each
other
save
at
critical
times
when
they
were
occupied
with
the
adventures
of
others
and
not
with
their
own
but
at
the
first
onslaught
of
danger
rénine
realized
the
place
which
hortense
had
taken
in
his
life
and
he
was
in
despair
at
knowing
her
to
be
a
prisoner
and
a
martyr
and
at
being
unable
to
save
her
he
spent
a
feverish
agitated
night
turning
the
case
over
and
over
from
every
point
of
view
the
wednesday
morning
was
also
a
terrible
time
for
him
he
was
losing
ground
giving
up
his
seclusion
he
threw
open
the
windows
and
paced
to
and
fro
through
his
rooms
ran
out
into
the
street
and
came
in
again
as
though
fleeing
before
the
thought
that
obsessed
him
hortense
is
suffering
hortense
is
in
the
depths
she
sees
the
hatchet
she
is
calling
to
me
she
is
entreating
me
and
i
can
do
nothing
it
was
at
five
in
the
afternoon
that
on
examining
the
list
of
the
six
names
he
received
that
little
inward
shock
which
is
a
sort
of
signal
of
the
truth
that
is
being
sought
for
a
light
shot
through
his
mind
it
was
not
to
be
sure
that
brilliant
light
in
which
every
detail
is
made
plain
but
it
was
enough
to
tell
him
in
which
direction
to
move
his
plan
of
campaign
was
formed
at
once
he
sent
adolphe
his
chauffeur
to
the
principal
newspapers
with
a
few
lines
which
were
to
appear
in
type
among
the
next
morning
advertisements
adolphe
was
also
told
to
go
to
the
laundry
at
courbevoie
where
mlle
covereau
the
second
of
the
six
victims
had
been
employed
on
the
thursday
rénine
did
not
stir
out
of
doors
in
the
afternoon
he
received
several
letters
in
reply
to
his
advertisement
then
two
telegrams
arrived
lastly
at
three
there
came
a
pneumatic
letter
bearing
the
trocadéro
postmark
which
seemed
to
be
what
he
was
expecting
he
turned
up
a
directory
noted
an
address
de
retired
colonial
governor
avenue
kléber
and
ran
down
to
his
car
adolphe
avenue
kléber
he
was
shown
into
a
large
study
furnished
with
magnificent
containing
old
volumes
in
costly
bindings
de
was
a
man
still
in
the
prime
of
life
wearing
a
slightly
grizzled
beard
and
by
his
affable
manners
and
genuine
distinction
commanding
confidence
and
liking
de
lourtier
said
rénine
i
have
ventured
to
call
on
your
excellency
because
i
read
in
last
year
newspapers
that
you
used
to
know
one
of
the
victims
of
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
honorine
vernisset
why
of
course
we
knew
her
cried
de
lourtier
my
wife
used
to
employ
her
as
a
dressmaker
by
the
day
poor
girl
de
lourtier
a
lady
of
my
acquaintance
has
disappeared
as
the
other
six
victims
disappeared
what
exclaimed
de
lourtier
with
a
start
but
i
have
followed
the
newspapers
carefully
there
was
nothing
on
the
of
october
yes
a
woman
of
whom
i
am
very
fond
madame
hortense
daniel
was
abducted
on
the
of
october
and
this
is
the
yes
and
the
murder
will
be
committed
on
the
horrible
horrible
it
must
be
prevented
at
all
costs
and
i
shall
perhaps
succeed
in
preventing
it
with
your
assistance
but
have
you
been
to
the
police
no
we
are
faced
by
mysteries
which
are
so
to
speak
absolute
and
compact
which
offer
no
gap
through
which
the
keenest
eyes
can
see
and
which
it
is
useless
to
hope
to
clear
up
by
ordinary
methods
such
as
inspection
of
the
scenes
of
the
crimes
police
enquiries
searching
for
and
so
on
as
none
of
those
proceedings
served
any
good
purpose
in
the
previous
cases
it
would
be
waste
of
time
to
resort
to
them
in
a
seventh
similar
case
an
enemy
who
displays
such
skill
and
subtlety
would
not
leave
behind
her
any
of
those
clumsy
traces
which
are
the
first
things
that
a
professional
detective
seizes
upon
then
what
have
you
done
before
taking
any
action
i
have
reflected
i
gave
four
days
to
thinking
the
matter
over
de
examined
his
visitor
closely
and
with
a
touch
of
irony
asked
and
the
result
of
your
meditations
to
begin
with
said
rénine
refusing
to
be
put
out
of
countenance
i
have
submitted
all
these
cases
to
a
comprehensive
survey
which
hitherto
no
one
else
had
done
this
enabled
me
to
discover
their
general
meaning
to
put
aside
all
the
tangle
of
embarrassing
theories
and
since
no
one
was
able
to
agree
as
to
the
motives
of
all
this
filthy
business
to
attribute
it
to
the
only
class
of
persons
capable
of
it
that
is
to
say
lunatics
your
excellency
de
started
lunatics
what
an
idea
de
lourtier
the
woman
known
as
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
is
a
madwoman
but
she
would
be
locked
up
we
do
know
that
she
not
we
do
know
that
she
is
not
one
of
those
people
apparently
harmless
who
are
watched
so
slightly
that
they
have
full
scope
to
indulge
their
little
manias
their
instincts
nothing
could
be
more
treacherous
than
these
creatures
nothing
could
be
more
crafty
more
patient
more
persistent
more
dangerous
and
at
the
same
time
more
absurd
and
more
logical
more
slovenly
and
more
methodical
all
these
epithets
de
lourtier
may
be
applied
to
the
doings
of
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
the
obsession
of
an
idea
and
the
continual
repetition
of
an
act
are
characteristics
of
the
maniac
i
do
not
yet
know
the
idea
by
which
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
is
obsessed
but
i
do
know
the
act
that
results
from
it
and
it
is
always
the
same
the
victim
is
bound
with
precisely
similar
ropes
she
is
killed
after
the
same
number
of
days
she
is
struck
by
an
identical
blow
with
the
same
instrument
in
the
same
place
the
middle
of
the
forehead
producing
an
absolutely
vertical
wound
an
ordinary
murderer
displays
some
variety
his
trembling
hand
swerves
aside
and
strikes
awry
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
does
not
tremble
it
is
as
though
she
had
taken
measurements
and
the
edge
of
her
weapon
does
not
swerve
by
a
hair
breadth
need
i
give
you
any
further
proofs
or
examine
all
the
other
details
with
you
surely
not
you
now
possess
the
key
to
the
riddle
and
you
know
as
i
do
that
only
a
lunatic
can
behave
in
this
way
stupidly
savagely
mechanically
like
a
striking
clock
or
the
blade
of
the
guillotine
de
nodded
his
head
yes
that
is
so
one
can
see
the
whole
affair
from
that
angle
and
i
am
beginning
to
believe
that
this
is
how
one
ought
to
see
it
but
if
we
admit
that
this
madwoman
has
the
sort
of
mathematical
logic
which
governed
the
murders
of
the
six
victims
i
see
no
connection
between
the
victims
themselves
she
struck
at
random
why
this
victim
rather
than
that
ah
said
rénine
your
excellency
is
asking
me
a
question
which
i
asked
myself
from
the
first
moment
the
question
which
sums
up
the
whole
problem
and
which
cost
me
so
much
trouble
to
solve
why
hortense
daniel
rather
than
another
among
two
millions
of
women
who
might
have
been
selected
why
hortense
why
little
vernisset
why
miss
williamson
if
the
affair
is
such
as
i
conceived
it
as
a
whole
that
is
to
say
based
upon
the
blind
and
fantastic
logic
of
a
madwoman
a
choice
was
inevitably
exercised
now
in
what
did
that
choice
consist
what
was
the
quality
or
the
defect
or
the
sign
needed
to
induce
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
to
strike
in
a
word
if
she
chose
and
she
must
have
chosen
what
directed
her
choice
have
you
found
the
answer
rénine
paused
and
replied
yes
your
excellency
i
have
and
i
could
have
found
it
at
the
very
outset
since
all
that
i
had
to
do
was
to
make
a
careful
examination
of
the
list
of
victims
but
these
flashes
of
truth
are
never
kindled
save
in
a
brain
overstimulated
by
effort
and
reflection
i
stared
at
the
list
twenty
times
over
before
that
little
detail
took
a
definite
shape
i
do
follow
you
said
de
de
lourtier
it
may
be
noted
that
if
a
number
of
persons
are
brought
together
in
any
transaction
or
crime
or
public
scandal
or
what
not
they
are
almost
invariably
described
in
the
same
way
on
this
occasion
the
newspapers
never
mentioned
anything
more
than
their
surnames
in
speaking
of
madame
ladoue
mlle
ardent
or
mlle
covereau
on
the
other
hand
mlle
vernisset
and
miss
williamson
were
always
described
by
their
christian
names
as
well
honorine
and
hermione
if
the
same
thing
had
been
done
in
the
case
of
all
the
six
victims
there
would
have
been
no
mystery
why
not
because
we
should
at
once
have
realized
the
relation
existing
between
the
six
unfortunate
women
as
i
myself
suddenly
realized
it
on
comparing
those
two
christian
names
with
that
of
hortense
daniel
you
understand
now
you
you
see
the
three
christian
names
before
your
eyes
de
seemed
to
be
perturbed
turning
a
little
pale
he
said
what
do
you
mean
what
do
you
mean
i
mean
continued
rénine
in
a
clear
voice
sounding
each
syllable
separately
i
mean
that
you
see
before
your
eyes
three
christian
names
which
all
three
begin
with
the
same
initial
and
which
all
three
by
a
remarkable
coincidence
consist
of
the
same
number
of
letters
as
you
may
prove
if
you
enquire
at
the
courbevoie
laundry
where
mlle
covereau
used
to
work
you
will
find
that
her
name
was
hilairie
here
again
we
have
the
same
initial
and
the
same
number
of
letters
there
is
no
need
to
seek
any
farther
we
are
sure
are
we
not
that
the
christian
names
of
all
the
victims
offer
the
same
peculiarities
and
this
gives
us
with
absolute
certainty
the
key
to
the
problem
which
was
set
us
it
explains
the
madwoman
choice
we
now
know
the
connection
between
the
unfortunate
victims
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
it
it
that
and
nothing
else
and
how
this
method
of
choosing
confirms
my
theory
what
proof
of
madness
why
kill
these
women
rather
than
any
others
because
their
names
begin
with
an
h
and
consist
of
eight
letters
you
understand
me
de
lourtier
do
you
not
the
number
of
letters
is
eight
the
initial
letter
is
the
eighth
letter
of
the
alphabet
and
the
word
eight
begins
with
an
always
the
letter
the
implement
used
to
commit
the
crime
was
a
is
your
excellency
prepared
to
tell
me
that
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
is
not
a
madwoman
rénine
interrupted
himself
and
went
up
to
de
what
the
matter
your
excellency
are
you
unwell
no
no
said
de
lourtier
with
the
perspiration
streaming
down
his
forehead
no
but
all
this
story
is
so
upsetting
only
think
i
knew
one
of
the
victims
and
then
rénine
took
a
and
tumbler
from
a
small
table
filled
the
glass
and
handed
it
to
de
lourtier
who
sipped
a
few
mouthfuls
from
it
and
then
pulling
himself
together
continued
in
a
voice
which
he
strove
to
make
firmer
than
it
had
been
very
well
we
admit
your
supposition
even
so
it
is
necessary
that
it
should
lead
to
tangible
results
what
have
you
done
this
morning
i
published
in
all
the
newspapers
an
advertisement
worded
as
follows
cook
seeks
situation
write
before
to
herminie
boulevard
haussmann
etc
you
continue
to
follow
me
do
you
de
lourtier
christian
names
beginning
with
an
h
and
consisting
of
eight
letters
are
extremely
rare
and
are
all
rather
out
of
date
herminie
hilairie
hermione
well
these
christian
names
for
reasons
which
i
do
not
understand
are
essential
to
the
madwoman
she
can
not
do
without
them
to
find
women
bearing
one
of
these
christian
names
and
for
this
purpose
only
she
summons
up
all
her
remaining
powers
of
reason
discernment
reflection
and
intelligence
she
hunts
about
she
asks
questions
she
lies
in
wait
she
reads
newspapers
which
she
hardly
understands
but
in
which
certain
details
certain
capital
letters
catch
her
eye
and
consequently
i
did
not
doubt
for
a
second
that
this
name
of
herminie
printed
in
large
type
would
attract
her
attention
and
that
she
would
be
caught
in
the
trap
of
my
advertisement
did
she
write
asked
de
anxiously
several
ladies
rénine
continued
wrote
the
letters
which
are
usual
in
such
cases
to
offer
a
home
to
the
herminie
but
i
received
an
express
letter
which
struck
me
as
interesting
from
whom
read
it
de
lourtier
de
snatched
the
sheet
from
rénine
hands
and
cast
a
glance
at
the
signature
his
first
movement
was
one
of
surprise
as
though
he
had
expected
something
different
then
he
gave
a
long
loud
laugh
of
something
like
joy
and
relief
why
do
you
laugh
de
lourtier
you
seem
pleased
pleased
no
but
this
letter
is
signed
by
my
wife
and
you
were
afraid
of
finding
something
else
oh
no
but
since
it
my
wife
he
did
not
finish
his
sentence
and
said
to
rénine
come
this
way
he
led
him
through
a
passage
to
a
little
where
a
lady
with
a
happy
and
tender
expression
on
her
comely
face
was
sitting
in
the
midst
of
three
children
and
helping
them
with
their
lessons
she
rose
de
lourtier
briefly
presented
his
visitor
and
asked
his
wife
suzanne
is
this
express
message
from
you
to
mlle
herminie
boulevard
haussmann
yes
she
said
i
sent
it
as
you
know
our
leaving
and
i
looking
out
for
a
new
one
rénine
interrupted
her
excuse
me
madame
just
one
question
where
did
you
get
the
address
she
flushed
her
husband
insisted
tell
us
suzanne
who
gave
you
the
address
i
was
rung
up
by
whom
she
hesitated
and
then
said
your
old
nurse
félicienne
yes
de
lourtier
cut
short
the
conversation
and
without
permitting
rénine
to
ask
any
more
questions
took
him
back
to
the
study
you
see
monsieur
that
pneumatic
letter
came
from
a
quite
natural
source
félicienne
my
old
nurse
who
lives
not
far
from
paris
on
an
allowance
which
i
make
her
read
your
advertisement
and
told
madame
de
lourtier
of
it
for
after
all
he
added
laughing
i
do
suppose
that
you
suspect
my
wife
of
being
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
no
then
the
incident
is
closed
at
least
on
my
side
i
have
done
what
i
could
i
have
listened
to
your
arguments
and
i
am
very
sorry
that
i
can
be
of
no
more
use
to
you
he
drank
another
glass
of
water
and
sat
down
his
face
was
distorted
rénine
looked
at
him
for
a
few
seconds
as
a
man
will
look
at
a
failing
adversary
who
has
only
to
receive
the
blow
and
sitting
down
beside
him
suddenly
gripped
his
arm
your
excellency
if
you
do
not
speak
hortense
daniel
will
be
the
seventh
victim
i
have
nothing
to
say
monsieur
what
do
you
think
i
know
the
truth
my
explanations
have
made
it
plain
to
you
your
distress
your
terror
are
positive
proofs
but
after
all
monsieur
if
i
knew
why
should
i
be
silent
for
fear
of
scandal
there
is
in
your
life
so
a
profound
intuition
assures
me
something
that
you
are
constrained
to
hide
the
truth
about
this
monstrous
tragedy
which
suddenly
flashed
upon
you
this
truth
if
it
were
known
would
spell
dishonour
to
you
disgrace
and
you
are
shrinking
from
your
duty
de
lourtier
did
not
reply
rénine
leant
over
him
and
looking
him
in
the
eyes
whispered
there
will
be
no
scandal
i
shall
be
the
only
person
in
the
world
to
know
what
has
happened
and
i
am
as
much
interested
as
yourself
in
not
attracting
attention
because
i
love
hortense
daniel
and
do
not
wish
her
name
to
be
mixed
up
in
your
horrible
story
they
remained
face
to
face
during
a
long
interval
rénine
expression
was
harsh
and
unyielding
de
lourtier
felt
that
nothing
would
bend
him
if
the
necessary
words
remained
unspoken
but
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
utter
them
you
are
mistaken
he
said
you
think
you
have
seen
things
that
exist
rénine
received
a
sudden
and
terrifying
conviction
that
if
this
man
took
refuge
in
a
stolid
silence
there
was
no
hope
for
hortense
daniel
and
he
was
so
much
infuriated
by
the
thought
that
the
key
to
the
riddle
lay
there
within
reach
of
his
hand
that
he
clutched
de
lourtier
by
the
throat
and
forced
him
backwards
i
have
no
more
lies
a
woman
life
is
at
stake
speak
and
speak
at
once
if
not
de
lourtier
had
no
strength
left
in
him
all
resistance
was
impossible
it
was
not
that
rénine
attack
alarmed
him
or
that
he
was
yielding
to
this
act
of
violence
but
he
felt
crushed
by
that
indomitable
will
which
seemed
to
admit
no
obstacle
and
he
stammered
you
are
right
it
is
my
duty
to
tell
everything
whatever
comes
of
it
nothing
will
come
of
it
i
pledge
my
word
on
condition
that
you
save
hortense
daniel
a
moment
hesitation
may
undo
us
all
speak
no
details
but
the
actual
facts
madame
de
lourtier
is
not
my
wife
the
only
woman
who
has
the
right
to
bear
my
name
is
one
whom
i
married
when
i
was
a
young
colonial
official
she
was
a
rather
eccentric
woman
of
feeble
mentality
and
incredibly
subject
to
impulses
that
amounted
to
monomania
we
had
two
children
twins
whom
she
worshipped
and
in
whose
company
she
would
no
doubt
have
recovered
her
mental
balance
and
moral
health
when
by
a
stupid
accident
a
passing
carriage
they
were
killed
before
her
eyes
the
poor
thing
went
mad
with
the
silent
secretive
madness
which
you
imagined
some
time
afterwards
when
i
was
appointed
to
an
algerian
station
i
brought
her
to
france
and
put
her
in
the
charge
of
a
worthy
creature
who
had
nursed
me
and
brought
me
up
two
years
later
i
made
the
acquaintance
of
the
woman
who
was
to
become
the
joy
of
my
life
you
saw
her
just
now
she
is
the
mother
of
my
children
and
she
passes
as
my
wife
are
we
to
sacrifice
her
is
our
whole
existence
to
be
shipwrecked
in
horror
and
must
our
name
be
coupled
with
this
tragedy
of
madness
and
blood
rénine
thought
for
a
moment
and
asked
what
is
the
other
one
name
hermance
hermance
still
that
initial
still
those
eight
letters
that
was
what
made
me
realize
everything
just
now
said
de
lourtier
when
you
compared
the
different
names
i
at
once
reflected
that
my
unhappy
wife
was
called
hermance
and
that
she
was
mad
and
all
the
proofs
leapt
to
my
mind
but
though
we
understand
the
selection
of
the
victims
how
are
we
to
explain
the
murders
what
are
the
symptoms
of
her
madness
does
she
suffer
at
all
she
does
not
suffer
very
much
at
present
but
she
has
suffered
in
the
past
the
most
terrible
suffering
that
you
can
imagine
since
the
moment
when
her
two
children
were
run
over
before
her
eyes
night
and
day
she
had
the
horrible
spectacle
of
their
death
before
her
eyes
without
a
interruption
for
she
never
slept
for
a
single
second
think
of
the
torture
of
it
to
see
her
children
dying
through
all
the
hours
of
the
long
day
and
all
the
hours
of
the
interminable
night
nevertheless
rénine
objected
it
is
not
to
drive
away
that
picture
that
she
commits
murder
yes
possibly
said
de
lourtier
thoughtfully
to
drive
it
away
by
sleep
i
do
understand
you
do
understand
because
we
are
talking
of
a
madwoman
and
because
all
that
happens
in
that
disordered
brain
is
necessarily
incoherent
and
abnormal
obviously
but
all
the
same
is
your
supposition
based
on
facts
that
justify
it
yes
on
facts
which
i
had
in
a
way
overlooked
but
which
assume
their
true
significance
the
first
of
these
facts
dates
a
few
years
back
to
a
morning
when
my
old
nurse
for
the
first
time
found
hermance
fast
asleep
now
she
was
holding
her
hands
clutched
around
a
puppy
which
she
had
strangled
and
the
same
thing
was
repeated
on
three
other
occasions
and
she
slept
yes
each
time
she
slept
a
sleep
which
lasted
for
several
nights
and
what
conclusion
did
you
draw
i
concluded
that
the
relaxation
of
the
nerves
provoked
by
taking
life
exhausted
her
and
predisposed
her
for
sleep
rénine
shuddered
that
it
there
not
a
doubt
of
it
the
taking
life
the
effort
of
killing
makes
her
sleep
and
she
began
with
women
what
had
served
her
so
well
with
animals
all
her
madness
has
become
concentrated
on
that
one
point
she
kills
them
to
rob
them
of
their
sleep
she
wanted
sleep
and
she
steals
the
sleep
of
others
that
it
is
it
for
the
past
two
years
she
has
been
sleeping
for
the
past
two
years
she
has
been
sleeping
stammered
de
lourtier
rénine
gripped
him
by
the
shoulder
and
it
never
occurred
to
you
that
her
madness
might
go
farther
that
she
would
stop
at
nothing
to
win
the
blessing
of
sleep
let
us
make
haste
monsieur
all
this
is
horrible
they
were
both
making
for
the
door
when
de
lourtier
hesitated
the
was
ringing
it
from
there
he
said
from
there
yes
my
old
nurse
gives
me
the
news
at
the
same
time
every
day
he
unhooked
the
receivers
and
handed
one
to
rénine
who
whispered
in
his
ear
the
questions
which
he
was
to
put
is
that
you
félicienne
how
is
she
not
so
bad
sir
is
she
sleeping
well
not
very
well
lately
last
night
indeed
she
never
closed
her
eyes
so
she
very
gloomy
just
now
what
is
she
doing
at
the
moment
she
is
in
her
room
go
to
her
félicienne
and
do
leave
her
i
ca
she
locked
herself
in
you
must
félicienne
break
open
the
door
i
coming
straight
on
hullo
hullo
oh
damnation
they
cut
us
off
without
a
word
the
two
men
left
the
flat
and
ran
down
to
the
avenue
rénine
hustled
de
lourtier
into
the
car
what
address
ville
of
course
in
the
very
center
of
her
operations
like
a
spider
in
the
middle
of
her
web
oh
the
shame
of
it
he
was
profoundly
agitated
he
saw
the
whole
adventure
in
its
monstrous
reality
yes
she
kills
them
to
steal
their
sleep
as
she
used
to
kill
the
animals
it
is
the
same
obsession
but
complicated
by
a
whole
array
of
utterly
incomprehensible
practices
and
superstitions
she
evidently
fancies
that
the
similarity
of
the
christian
names
to
her
own
is
indispensable
and
that
she
will
not
sleep
unless
her
victim
is
an
hortense
or
an
honorine
a
madwoman
argument
its
logic
escapes
us
and
we
know
nothing
of
its
origin
but
we
ca
get
away
from
it
she
has
to
hunt
and
has
to
find
and
she
finds
and
carries
off
her
prey
beforehand
and
watches
over
it
for
the
appointed
number
of
days
until
the
moment
when
crazily
through
the
hole
which
she
digs
with
a
hatchet
in
the
middle
of
the
skull
she
absorbs
the
sleep
which
stupefies
her
and
grants
her
oblivion
for
a
given
period
and
here
again
we
see
absurdity
and
madness
why
does
she
fix
that
period
at
so
many
days
why
should
one
victim
ensure
her
a
hundred
and
twenty
days
of
sleep
and
another
a
hundred
and
what
insanity
the
calculation
is
mysterious
and
of
course
mad
but
the
fact
remains
that
at
the
end
of
a
hundred
or
a
hundred
and
days
as
the
case
may
be
a
fresh
victim
is
sacrificed
and
there
have
been
six
already
and
the
seventh
is
awaiting
her
turn
ah
monsieur
what
a
terrible
responsibility
for
you
such
a
monster
as
that
she
should
never
have
been
allowed
out
of
sight
de
made
no
protest
his
air
of
dejection
his
pallor
his
trembling
hands
all
proved
his
remorse
and
his
despair
she
deceived
me
he
murmured
she
was
outwardly
so
quiet
so
docile
and
after
all
she
in
a
lunatic
asylum
then
how
can
she
the
asylum
explained
de
lourtier
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
separate
buildings
scattered
over
extensive
grounds
the
sort
of
cottage
in
which
hermance
lives
stands
quite
apart
there
is
first
a
room
occupied
by
félicienne
then
hermance
bedroom
and
two
separate
rooms
one
of
which
has
its
windows
overlooking
the
open
country
i
suppose
it
is
there
that
she
locks
up
her
victims
but
the
carriage
that
conveys
the
dead
bodies
the
stables
of
the
asylum
are
quite
close
to
the
cottage
there
a
horse
and
carriage
there
for
station
work
hermance
no
doubt
gets
up
at
night
harnesses
the
horse
and
slips
the
body
through
the
window
and
the
nurse
who
watches
her
félicienne
is
very
old
and
rather
deaf
but
by
day
she
sees
her
mistress
moving
to
and
fro
doing
this
and
that
must
we
not
admit
a
certain
complicity
never
félicienne
herself
has
been
deceived
by
hermance
hypocrisy
all
the
same
it
was
she
who
telephoned
to
madame
de
lourtier
first
about
that
advertisement
very
naturally
hermance
who
talks
now
and
then
who
argues
who
buries
herself
in
the
newspapers
which
she
does
not
understand
as
you
were
saying
just
now
but
reads
through
them
attentively
must
have
seen
the
advertisement
and
having
heard
that
we
were
looking
for
a
servant
must
have
asked
félicienne
to
ring
me
up
yes
yes
that
is
what
i
felt
said
rénine
slowly
she
marks
down
her
victims
with
hortense
dead
she
would
have
known
once
she
had
used
up
her
allowance
of
sleep
where
to
find
an
eighth
victim
but
how
did
she
entice
the
unfortunate
women
how
did
she
entice
hortense
the
car
was
rushing
along
but
not
fast
enough
to
please
rénine
who
rated
the
chauffeur
push
her
along
adolphe
ca
you
we
losing
time
my
man
suddenly
the
fear
of
arriving
too
late
began
to
torture
him
the
logic
of
the
insane
is
subject
to
sudden
changes
of
mood
to
any
perilous
idea
that
may
enter
the
mind
the
madwoman
might
easily
mistake
the
date
and
hasten
the
catastrophe
like
a
clock
out
of
order
which
strikes
an
hour
too
soon
on
the
other
hand
as
her
sleep
was
once
more
disturbed
might
she
not
be
tempted
to
take
action
without
waiting
for
the
appointed
moment
was
this
not
the
reason
why
she
had
locked
herself
into
her
room

what
agonies
her
prisoner
must
be
suffering

they
reached

there
was
a
steep
sloping
road
on
the
right
and

by
a
long
railing

round
the

must

warning

our
presence

de

where
is
the
cottage
just
opposite
said
de
they
got
out
a
little
farther
on
rénine
began
to
run
along
a
bank
at
the
side
of
an
sunken
road
it
was
almost
dark
de
lourtier
said
here
this
building
standing
a
little
way
back
look
at
that
window
on
the
it
belongs
to
one
of
the
separate
rooms
and
that
is
obviously
how
she
slips
out
but
the
window
seems
to
be
barred
yes
and
that
is
why
no
one
suspected
anything
but
she
must
have
found
some
way
to
get
through
the
was
built
over
deep
cellars
rénine
quickly
clambered
up
finding
a
foothold
on
a
projecting
ledge
of
stone
sure
enough
one
of
the
bars
was
missing
he
pressed
his
face
to
the
and
looked
in
the
room
was
dark
inside
nevertheless
he
was
able
to
distinguish
at
the
back
a
woman
seated
beside
another
woman
who
was
lying
on
a
mattress
the
woman
seated
was
holding
her
forehead
in
her
hands
and
gazing
at
the
woman
who
was
lying
down
it
she
whispered
de
lourtier
who
had
also
climbed
the
wall
the
other
one
is
bound
rénine
took
from
his
pocket
a
glazier
diamond
and
cut
out
one
of
the
panes
without
making
enough
noise
to
arouse
the
madwoman
attention
he
next
slid
his
hand
to
the
and
turned
it
softly
while
with
his
left
hand
he
levelled
a
revolver
you
not
going
to
fire
surely
de
entreated
if
i
must
i
shall
rénine
pushed
open
the
window
gently
but
there
was
an
obstacle
of
which
he
was
not
aware
a
chair
which
toppled
over
and
fell
he
leapt
into
the
room
and
threw
away
his
revolver
in
order
to
seize
the
madwoman
but
she
did
not
wait
for
him
she
rushed
to
the
door
opened
it
and
fled
with
a
hoarse
cry
de
lourtier
made
as
though
to
run
after
her
what
the
use
said
rénine
kneeling
down
let
save
the
victim
first
he
was
instantly
reassured
hortense
was
alive
the
first
thing
that
he
did
was
to
cut
the
cords
and
remove
the
gag
that
was
stifling
her
attracted
by
the
noise
the
old
nurse
had
hastened
to
the
room
with
a
lamp
which
rénine
took
from
her
casting
its
light
on
hortense
he
was
astounded
though
livid
and
exhausted
with
emaciated
features
and
eyes
blazing
with
fever
hortense
was
trying
to
smile
she
whispered
i
was
expecting
you
i
did
not
despair
for
a
moment
i
was
sure
of
you
she
fainted
an
hour
later
after
much
useless
searching
around
the
cottage
they
found
the
madwoman
locked
into
a
large
cupboard
in
the
loft
she
had
hanged
herself
hortense
refused
to
stay
another
night
besides
it
was
better
that
the
cottage
should
be
empty
when
the
old
nurse
announced
the
suicide
rénine
gave
félicienne
minute
directions
as
to
what
she
should
do
and
say
and
then
assisted
by
the
chauffeur
and
de
lourtier
carried
hortense
to
the
car
and
brought
her
home
she
was
soon
convalescent
two
days
later
rénine
carefully
questioned
her
and
asked
her
how
she
had
come
to
know
the
madwoman
it
was
very
simple
she
said
my
husband
who
is
not
quite
sane
as
i
have
told
you
is
being
looked
after
at
ville
and
i
sometimes
go
to
see
him
without
telling
anybody
i
admit
that
was
how
i
came
to
speak
to
that
poor
madwoman
and
how
the
other
day
she
made
signs
that
she
wanted
me
to
visit
her
we
were
alone
i
went
into
the
cottage
she
threw
herself
upon
me
and
overpowered
me
before
i
had
time
to
cry
for
help
i
thought
it
was
a
jest
and
so
it
was
was
it
a
madwoman
jest
she
was
quite
gentle
with
me
all
the
same
she
let
me
starve
but
i
was
so
sure
of
you
and
were
you
frightened
of
starving
no
besides
she
gave
me
some
food
now
and
then
when
the
fancy
took
her
and
then
i
was
sure
of
you
yes
but
there
was
something
else
that
other
peril
what
other
peril
she
asked
ingenuously
rénine
gave
a
start
he
suddenly
understood
it
seemed
strange
at
first
though
it
was
quite
natural
that
hortense
had
not
for
a
moment
suspected
and
did
not
yet
suspect
the
terrible
danger
which
she
had
run
her
mind
had
not
connected
with
her
own
adventure
the
murders
committed
by
the
lady
with
the
hatchet
he
thought
that
it
would
always
be
time
enough
to
tell
her
the
truth
for
that
matter
a
few
days
later
her
husband
who
had
been
locked
up
for
years
died
in
the
asylum
at
ville
and
hortense
who
had
been
recommended
by
her
doctor
a
short
period
of
rest
and
solitude
went
to
stay
with
a
relation
living
near
the
village

my
dear
friend
you
must
be
thinking
me
very
ungrateful
i
have
been
here
three
weeks
and
you
have
had
not
one
letter
from
me
not
a
word
of
thanks
and
yet
i
ended
by
realizing
from
what
terrible
death
you
saved
me
and
understanding
the
secret
of
that
terrible
business
but
indeed
indeed
i
could
help
it
i
was
in
such
a
state
of
prostration
after
it
all
i
needed
rest
and
solitude
so
badly
was
i
to
stay
in
paris
was
i
to
continue
my
expeditions
with
you
no
no
no
i
had
had
enough
adventures
other
people
are
very
interesting
i
admit
but
when
one
is
one
self
the
victim
and
barely
escapes
with
one
life
oh
my
dear
friend
how
horrible
it
was
shall
i
ever
forget
it
here
at
la
roncière
i
enjoy
the
greatest
peace
my
old
spinster
cousin
ermelin
pets
and
coddles
me
like
an
invalid
i
am
getting
back
my
colour
and
am
very
well
physically
so
much
so
in
fact
that
i
no
longer
ever
think
of
interesting
myself
in
other
people
business
never
again
for
instance
i
am
only
telling
you
this
because
you
are
incorrigible
as
inquisitive
as
any
old
charwoman
and
always
ready
to
busy
yourself
with
things
that
do
concern
you
yesterday
i
was
present
at
a
rather
curious
meeting
antoinette
had
taken
me
to
the
inn
at
bassicourt
where
we
were
having
tea
in
the
public
room
among
the
peasants
it
was
when
the
arrival
of
three
people
two
men
and
a
woman
caused
a
sudden
pause
in
the
conversation
one
of
the
men
was
a
fat
farmer
in
a
long
blouse
with
a
jovial
red
face
framed
in
white
whiskers
the
other
was
younger
was
dressed
in
corduroy
and
had
lean
yellow
features
each
of
them
carried
a
gun
slung
over
his
shoulder
between
them
was
a
short
slender
young
woman
in
a
brown
cloak
and
a
fur
cap
whose
rather
thin
and
extremely
pale
face
was
surprisingly
delicate
and
son
and
whispered
my
cousin
can
that
charming
creature
be
the
wife
of
that
the
of
baron
de
gorne
the
old
fellow
over
there
a
baron
descended
from
a
very
ancient
noble
family
which
used
to
own
the
château
in
the
old
days
he
has
always
lived
like
a
peasant
a
great
hunter
a
great
drinker
a
great
litigant
always
at
law
with
somebody
now
very
nearly
ruined
his
son
mathias
was
more
ambitious
and
less
attached
to
the
soil
and
studied
for
the
bar
then
he
went
to
america
next
the
lack
of
money
brought
him
back
to
the
village
whereupon
he
fell
in
love
with
a
young
girl
in
the
nearest
town
the
poor
girl
consented
no
one
knows
why
to
marry
him
and
for
five
years
past
she
has
been
leading
the
life
of
a
hermit
or
rather
of
a
prisoner
in
a
little
close
by
the
the
well
manor
the
father
and
the
son
i
asked
the
father
lives
at
the
far
end
of
the
village
on
a
lonely
farm
is
master
mathias
jealous
perfect
tiger
reason
reason
for
natalie
de
gorne
is
the
straightest
woman
in
the
world
and
it
is
not
her
fault
if
a
handsome
young
man
has
been
hanging
around
the
for
the
past
few
months
however
the
de
gornes
ca
get
over
it
the
father
neither
handsome
young
man
is
the
last
descendant
of
the
people
who
bought
the
château
long
ago
this
explains
old
de
gorne
hatred
jérôme
vignal
i
know
him
and
am
very
fond
of
him
is
a
fellow
and
very
well
off
and
he
has
sworn
to
run
off
with
natalie
de
gorne
the
old
man
who
says
so
whenever
he
has
had
a
drop
too
much
there
listen
the
old
chap
was
sitting
among
a
group
of
men
who
were
amusing
themselves
by
making
him
drink
and
plying
him
with
questions
he
was
already
a
little
bit
and
was
holding
forth
with
a
tone
of
indignation
and
a
mocking
smile
which
formed
the
most
comic
contrast
wasting
his
time
i
tell
you
the
coxcomb
it
no
manner
of
use
his
poaching
round
our
way
and
making
at
the
wench
the
coverts
are
watched
if
he
comes
too
near
it
means
a
bullet
eh
mathias
he
gripped
his
hand
then
the
little
wench
knows
how
to
defend
herself
too
he
chuckled
you
do
want
any
admirers
do
you
natalie
the
young
wife
blushed
in
her
confusion
at
being
addressed
in
these
terms
while
her
husband
growled
do
better
to
hold
your
tongue
father
there
are
things
one
talk
about
in
public
that
affect
one
honour
are
best
settled
in
public
retorted
the
old
one
i
concerned
the
honour
of
the
de
gornes
comes
before
everything
and
that
fine
spark
with
his
paris
airs
he
stopped
short
before
him
stood
a
man
who
had
just
come
in
and
who
seemed
to
be
waiting
for
him
to
finish
his
sentence
the
newcomer
was
a
tall
young
fellow
in
with
a
in
his
hand
his
strong
and
rather
stern
face
was
lighted
up
by
a
pair
of
fine
eyes
in
which
shone
an
ironical
smile
vignal
whispered
my
cousin
the
young
man
seemed
not
at
all
embarrassed
on
seeing
natalie
he
made
a
low
bow
and
when
mathias
de
gorne
took
a
step
forward
he
eyed
him
from
head
to
foot
as
though
to
say
what
about
it
and
his
attitude
was
so
haughty
and
contemptuous
that
the
de
gornes
unslung
their
guns
and
took
them
in
both
hands
like
sportsmen
about
to
shoot
the
son
expression
was
very
fierce
jérôme
was
quite
unmoved
by
the
threat
after
a
few
seconds
turning
to
the
he
remarked
i
say
i
came
to
see
old
vasseur
but
his
shop
is
shut
would
you
mind
giving
him
the
holster
of
my
revolver
it
wants
a
stitch
or
two
he
handed
the
holster
to
the
and
added
laughing
keeping
the
revolver
in
case
i
need
it
you
never
can
tell
then
still
very
calmly
he
took
a
cigarette
from
a
silver
case
lit
it
and
walked
out
we
saw
him
through
the
window
vaulting
on
his
horse
and
riding
off
at
a
slow
trot
old
de
gorne
tossed
off
a
glass
of
brandy
swearing
most
horribly
his
son
clapped
his
hand
to
the
old
man
mouth
and
forced
him
to
sit
down
natalie
de
gorne
was
weeping
beside
them
that
my
story
dear
friend
as
you
see
it
not
tremendously
interesting
and
does
not
deserve
your
attention
there
no
mystery
in
it
and
no
part
for
you
to
play
indeed
i
particularly
insist
that
you
should
not
seek
a
pretext
for
any
untimely
interference
of
course
i
should
be
glad
to
see
the
poor
thing
protected
she
appears
to
be
a
perfect
martyr
but
as
i
said
before
let
us
leave
other
people
to
get
out
of
their
own
troubles
and
go
no
farther
with
our
little
experiments
rénine
finished
reading
the
letter
read
it
over
again
and
ended
by
saying
that
it
everything
right
as
right
can
be
she
does
want
to
continue
our
little
experiments
because
this
would
make
the
seventh
and
because
she
afraid
of
the
eighth
which
under
the
terms
of
our
agreement
has
a
very
particular
significance
she
does
want
to
and
she
does
want
to
without
seeming
to
want
to
he
rubbed
his
hands
the
letter
was
an
invaluable
witness
to
the
influence
which
he
had
gradually
gently
and
patiently
gained
over
hortense
daniel
it
betrayed
a
rather
complex
feeling
composed
of
admiration
unbounded
confidence
uneasiness
at
times
fear
and
almost
terror
but
also
love
he
was
convinced
of
that
his
companion
in
adventures
which
she
shared
with
a
good
fellowship
that
excluded
any
awkwardness
between
them
she
had
suddenly
taken
fright
and
a
sort
of
modesty
mingled
with
a
certain
coquetry
was
impelling
her
to
hold
back
that
very
evening
sunday
rénine
took
the
train
and
at
break
of
day
after
covering
by
diligence
on
a
road
white
with
snow
the
five
miles
between
the
little
town
of
pompignat
where
he
alighted
and
the
village
of
bassicourt
he
learnt
that
his
journey
might
prove
of
some
use
three
shots
had
been
heard
during
the
night
in
the
direction
of
the
three
shots
sergeant
i
heard
them
as
plainly
as
i
see
you
standing
before
me
said
a
peasant
whom
the
gendarmes
were
questioning
in
the
parlour
of
the
inn
which
rénine
had
entered
so
did
i
said
the
waiter
three
shots
it
may
have
been
twelve
at
night
the
snow
which
had
been
falling
since
nine
had
stopped
and
the
shots
sounded
across
the
fields
one
after
the
other
bang
bang
bang
five
more
peasants
gave
their
evidence
the
sergeant
and
his
men
had
heard
nothing
because
the
backed
on
the
fields
but
a
and
a
woman
arrived
who
said
that
they
were
in
mathias
de
gorne
service
that
they
had
been
away
for
two
days
because
of
the
intervening
sunday
and
that
they
had
come
straight
from
the
where
they
were
unable
to
obtain
admission
the
gate
of
the
grounds
is
locked
sergeant
said
the
man
it
the
first
time
i
known
this
to
happen
mathias
comes
out
to
open
it
himself
every
morning
at
the
stroke
of
six
winter
and
summer
well
past
eight
now
i
called
and
shouted
nobody
answered
so
we
came
on
here
you
might
have
enquired
at
old
de
gorne
said
the
sergeant
he
lives
on
the
on
my
word
so
i
might
i
never
thought
of
that
we
better
go
there
now
the
sergeant
decided
two
of
his
men
went
with
him
as
well
as
the
peasants
and
a
locksmith
whose
services
were
called
into
requisition
rénine
joined
the
party
soon
at
the
end
of
the
village
they
reached
old
de
gorne
farmyard
which
rénine
recognized
by
hortense
description
of
its
position
the
old
fellow
was
harnessing
his
horse
and
trap
when
they
told
him
what
had
happened
he
burst
out
laughing
three
shots
bang
bang
bang
why
my
dear
sergeant
there
are
only
two
barrels
to
mathias
gun
what
about
the
locked
gate
it
means
that
the
lad
asleep
that
all
last
night
he
came
and
cracked
a
bottle
with
me
perhaps
two
or
even
three
and
he
be
sleeping
it
off
i
expect
he
and
natalie
he
climbed
on
to
the
box
of
his
trap
an
old
cart
with
a
patched
tilt
and
cracked
his
whip
gentlemen
all
those
three
shots
of
yours
wo
stop
me
from
going
to
market
at
pompignat
as
i
do
every
monday
i
a
couple
of
calves
under
the
tilt
and
they
just
fit
for
the
butcher
to
you
the
others
walked
on
rénine
went
up
to
the
sergeant
and
gave
him
his
name
i
a
friend
of
mlle
ermelin
of
la
roncière
and
as
it
too
early
to
call
on
her
yet
i
shall
be
glad
if
you
allow
me
to
go
round
by
the
manor
with
you
mlle
ermelin
knows
madame
de
gorne
and
it
will
be
a
satisfaction
to
me
to
relieve
her
mind
for
there
nothing
wrong
at
the
i
hope
if
there
is
replied
the
sergeant
we
shall
read
all
about
it
as
plainly
as
on
a
map
because
of
the
snow
he
was
a
likable
young
man
and
seemed
smart
and
intelligent
from
the
very
first
he
had
shown
great
acuteness
in
observing
the
tracks
which
mathias
had
left
behind
him
the
evening
before
on
returning
home
tracks
which
soon
became
confused
with
the
footprints
made
in
going
and
coming
by
the
and
the
woman
meanwhile
they
came
to
the
walls
of
a
property
of
which
the
locksmith
readily
opened
the
gate
from
here
onward
a
single
trail
appeared
upon
the
spotless
snow
that
of
mathias
and
it
was
easy
to
perceive
that
the
son
must
have
shared
largely
in
the
father
libations
as
the
line
of
footprints
described
sudden
curves
which
made
it
swerve
right
up
to
the
trees
of
the
avenue
two
hundred
yards
farther
stood
the
dilapidated
building
of
the
the
principal
door
was
open
let
go
in
said
the
sergeant
and
the
moment
he
had
crossed
the
threshold
he
muttered
oho
old
de
gorne
made
a
mistake
in
not
coming
they
been
fighting
in
here
the
big
room
was
in
disorder
two
shattered
chairs
the
overturned
table
and
much
broken
glass
and
china
bore
witness
to
the
violence
of
the
struggle
the
tall
clock
lying
on
the
ground
had
stopped
at
twenty
past
eleven
with
the
showing
them
the
way
they
ran
up
to
the
first
floor
neither
mathias
nor
his
wife
was
there
but
the
door
of
their
bedroom
had
been
broken
down
with
a
hammer
which
they
discovered
under
the
bed
rénine
and
the
sergeant
went
downstairs
again
the
had
a
passage
communicating
with
the
kitchen
which
lay
at
the
back
of
the
house
and
opened
on
a
small
yard
fenced
off
from
the
orchard
at
the
end
of
this
enclosure
was
a
well
near
which
one
was
bound
to
pass
now
from
the
door
of
the
kitchen
to
the
well
the
snow
which
was
not
very
thick
had
been
pressed
down
to
this
side
and
that
as
though
a
body
had
been
dragged
over
it
and
all
around
the
well
were
tangled
traces
of
trampling
feet
showing
that
the
struggle
must
have
been
resumed
at
this
spot
the
sergeant
again
discovered
mathias
footprints
together
with
others
which
were
shapelier
and
lighter
these
latter
went
straight
into
the
orchard
by
themselves
and
thirty
yards
on
near
the
footprints
a
revolver
was
picked
up
and
recognized
by
one
of
the
peasants
as
resembling
that
which
jérôme
vignal
had
produced
in
the
inn
two
days
before
the
sergeant
examined
the
cylinder
three
of
the
seven
bullets
had
been
fired
and
so
the
tragedy
was
little
by
little
reconstructed
in
its
main
outlines
and
the
sergeant
who
had
ordered
everybody
to
stand
aside
and
not
to
step
on
the
site
of
the
footprints
came
back
to
the
well
leant
over
put
a
few
questions
to
the
and
going
up
to
rénine
whispered
it
all
seems
fairly
clear
to
me
rénine
took
his
arm
let
speak
out
plainly
sergeant
i
understand
the
business
pretty
well
for
as
i
told
you
i
know
mlle
ermelin
who
is
a
friend
of
jérôme
vignal
and
also
knows
madame
de
gorne
do
you
suppose
i
do
want
to
suppose
anything
i
simply
declare
that
some
one
came
there
last
night
by
which
way
the
only
tracks
of
a
person
coming
towards
the
manor
are
those
of
de
gorne
that
because
the
other
person
arrived
before
the
snowfall
that
is
to
say
before
nine
then
he
must
have
hidden
in
a
corner
of
the
and
waited
for
the
return
of
de
gorne
who
came
after
the
snow
just
so
as
soon
as
mathias
came
in
the
man
went
for
him
there
was
a
fight
mathias
made
his
escape
through
the
kitchen
the
man
ran
after
him
to
the
well
and
fired
three
and
where
the
body
down
the
well
rénine
protested
oh
i
say
are
you
taking
a
lot
for
granted
why
sir
the
snow
there
to
tell
the
story
and
the
snow
plainly
says
that
after
the
struggle
after
the
three
shots
one
man
alone
walked
away
and
left
the
farm
one
man
only
and
his
footprints
are
not
those
of
mathias
de
gorne
then
where
can
mathias
de
gorne
be
but
the
well
can
be
dragged
no
the
well
is
practically
bottomless
it
is
known
all
over
the
district
and
gives
its
name
to
the
manor
so
you
really
believe
i
repeat
what
i
said
before
the
snowfall
a
single
arrival
mathias
and
a
single
departure
the
stranger
and
madame
de
gorne
was
she
too
killed
and
thrown
down
the
well
like
her
husband
no
carried
off
carried
off
remember
that
her
bedroom
was
broken
down
with
a
hammer
come
come
sergeant
you
yourself
declare
that
there
was
only
one
departure
the
stranger
stoop
down
look
at
the
man
footprints
see
how
they
sink
into
the
snow
until
they
actually
touch
the
ground
those
are
the
footprints
of
a
man
laden
with
a
heavy
burden
the
stranger
was
carrying
madame
de
gorne
on
his
shoulder
then
there
an
outlet
this
way
yes
a
little
door
of
which
mathias
de
gorne
always
had
the
key
on
him
the
man
must
have
taken
it
from
him
a
way
out
into
the
open
fields
yes
a
road
which
joins
the
departmental
highway
three
quarters
of
a
mile
from
here
and
do
you
know
where
where
at
the
corner
of
the
château
jérôme
vignal
château
by
jove
this
is
beginning
to
look
serious
if
the
trail
leads
to
the
château
and
stops
there
we
shall
know
where
we
stand
the
trail
did
continue
to
the
château
as
they
were
able
to
perceive
after
following
it
across
the
undulating
fields
on
which
the
snow
lay
heaped
in
places
the
approach
to
the
main
gates
had
been
swept
but
they
saw
that
another
trail
formed
by
the
two
wheels
of
a
vehicle
was
running
in
the
opposite
direction
to
the
village
the
sergeant
rang
the
bell
the
porter
who
had
also
been
sweeping
the
drive
came
to
the
gates
with
a
broom
in
his
hand
in
answer
to
a
question
the
man
said
that
vignal
had
gone
away
that
morning
before
anyone
else
was
up
and
that
he
himself
had
harnessed
the
horse
to
the
trap
in
that
case
said
rénine
when
they
had
moved
away
all
we
have
to
do
is
to
follow
the
tracks
of
the
wheels
that
will
be
no
use
said
the
sergeant
they
have
taken
the
railway
at
pompignat
station
where
i
came
from
but
they
would
have
passed
through
the
village
they
have
gone
just
the
other
way
because
it
leads
to
the
town
where
the
express
trains
stop
the
has
an
office
in
the
town
telephone
and
as
there
no
train
before
eleven
all
that
they
need
do
is
to
keep
a
watch
at
the
station
i
think
you
doing
the
right
thing
sergeant
said
rénine
and
i
congratulate
you
on
the
way
in
which
you
have
carried
out
your
investigation
they
parted
rénine
went
back
to
the
inn
in
the
village
and
sent
a
note
to
hortense
daniel
by
hand
my
very
dear
friend
i
seemed
to
gather
from
your
letter
that
touched
as
always
by
anything
that
concerns
the
heart
you
were
anxious
to
protect
the
of
jérôme
and
natalie
now
there
is
every
reason
to
suppose
that
these
two
without
consulting
their
fair
protectress
have
run
away
after
throwing
mathias
de
gorne
down
a
well
forgive
me
for
not
coming
to
see
you
the
whole
thing
is
extremely
obscure
and
if
i
were
with
you
i
should
not
have
the
detachment
of
mind
which
is
needed
to
think
the
case
over
it
was
then
ten
rénine
went
for
a
walk
into
the
country
with
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
and
without
vouchsafing
a
glance
at
the
exquisite
spectacle
of
the
white
meadows
he
came
back
for
lunch
still
absorbed
in
his
thoughts
and
indifferent
to
the
talk
of
the
customers
of
the
inn
who
on
all
sides
were
discussing
recent
events
he
went
up
to
his
room
and
had
been
asleep
some
time
when
he
was
awakened
by
a
tapping
at
the
door
he
got
up
and
opened
it
is
it
you
is
it
you
he
whispered
hortense
and
he
stood
gazing
at
each
other
for
some
seconds
in
silence
holding
each
other
hands
as
though
nothing
no
irrelevant
thought
and
no
utterance
must
be
allowed
to
interfere
with
the
joy
of
their
meeting
then
he
asked
was
i
right
in
coming
yes
she
said
gently
i
expected
you
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
if
you
had
sent
for
me
sooner
instead
of
waiting
events
did
not
wait
you
see
and
i
do
quite
know
to
become
of
jérôme
vignal
and
natalie
de
gorne
what
have
you
heard
she
said
quickly
they
been
arrested
they
were
going
to
travel
by
the
express
arrested
no
rénine
objected
people
are
not
arrested
like
that
they
have
to
be
questioned
first
that
what
being
done
now
the
authorities
are
making
a
search
where
at
the
château
and
as
they
are
innocent
for
they
are
innocent
are
they
you
do
admit
that
they
are
guilty
any
more
than
i
do
he
replied
i
admit
nothing
i
can
admit
nothing
my
dear
nevertheless
i
am
bound
to
say
that
everything
is
against
them
except
one
fact
which
is
that
everything
is
too
much
against
them
it
is
not
normal
for
so
many
proofs
to
be
heaped
up
one
on
top
of
the
other
and
for
the
man
who
commits
a
murder
to
tell
his
story
so
frankly
apart
from
this
there
nothing
but
mystery
and
discrepancy
well
well
i
am
greatly
puzzled
but
you
have
a
plan
none
at
all
so
far
ah
if
i
could
see
him
jérôme
vignal
and
her
natalie
de
gorne
and
hear
them
and
know
what
they
are
saying
in
their
own
defence
but
you
can
understand
that
i
be
permitted
either
to
ask
them
any
questions
or
to
be
present
at
their
examination
besides
it
must
be
finished
by
this
time
it
finished
at
the
château
she
said
but
it
going
to
be
continued
at
the
are
they
taking
them
to
the
he
asked
eagerly
yes
at
least
judging
by
what
was
said
to
the
chauffeur
of
one
of
the
procurator
two
cars
oh
in
that
case
exclaimed
rénine
the
thing
done
the
why
we
shall
be
in
the
front
row
of
the
stalls
we
shall
see
and
hear
everything
and
as
a
word
a
tone
of
the
voice
a
quiver
of
the
eyelids
will
be
enough
to
give
me
the
tiny
clue
i
need
we
may
entertain
some
hope
come
along
he
took
her
by
the
direct
route
which
he
had
followed
that
morning
leading
to
the
gate
which
the
locksmith
had
opened
the
gendarmes
on
duty
at
the
had
made
a
passage
through
the
snow
beside
the
line
of
footprints
and
around
the
house
chance
enabled
rénine
and
hortense
to
approach
unseen
and
through
a
to
enter
a
corridor
near
a
a
few
steps
up
was
a
little
chamber
which
received
its
only
light
through
a
sort
of
from
the
large
room
on
the
rénine
during
the
morning
visit
had
noticed
the
which
was
covered
on
the
inside
with
a
piece
of
cloth
he
removed
the
cloth
and
cut
out
one
of
the
panes
a
few
minutes
later
a
sound
of
voices
rose
from
the
other
side
of
the
house
no
doubt
near
the
well
the
sound
grew
more
distinct
a
number
of
people
flocked
into
the
house
some
of
them
went
up
stairs
to
the
first
floor
while
the
sergeant
arrived
with
a
young
man
of
whom
rénine
and
hortense
were
able
to
distinguish
only
the
tall
figure
jérôme
vignal
said
she
yes
said
rénine
they
are
examining
madame
de
gorne
first
upstairs
in
her
bedroom
a
quarter
of
an
hour
passed
then
the
persons
on
the
first
floor
came
downstairs
and
went
in
they
were
the
procurator
deputy
his
clerk
a
commissary
of
police
and
two
detectives
madame
de
gorne
was
shown
in
and
the
deputy
asked
jérôme
vignal
to
step
forward
jérôme
vignal
face
was
certainly
that
of
the
strong
man
whom
hortense
had
depicted
in
her
letter
he
displayed
no
uneasiness
but
rather
decision
and
a
resolute
will
natalie
who
was
short
and
very
slight
with
a
feverish
light
in
her
eyes
nevertheless
produced
the
same
impression
of
quiet
confidence
the
deputy
who
was
examining
the
disordered
furniture
and
the
traces
of
the
struggle
invited
her
to
sit
down
and
said
to
jérôme
monsieur
i
have
not
asked
you
many
questions
so
far
this
is
a
summary
enquiry
which
i
am
conducting
in
your
presence
and
which
will
be
continued
later
by
the
and
i
wished
above
all
to
explain
to
you
the
very
serious
reasons
for
which
i
asked
you
to
interrupt
your
journey
and
to
come
back
here
with
madame
de
gorne
you
are
now
in
a
position
to
refute
the
truly
distressing
charges
that
are
hanging
over
you
i
therefore
ask
you
to
tell
me
the
exact
truth
deputy
replied
jérôme
the
charges
in
question
trouble
me
very
little
the
truth
for
which
you
are
asking
will
defeat
all
the
lies
which
chance
has
accumulated
against
me
it
is
this
he
reflected
for
an
instant
and
then
in
clear
frank
tones
said
i
love
madame
de
gorne
the
first
time
i
met
her
i
conceived
the
greatest
sympathy
and
admiration
for
her
but
my
affection
has
always
been
directed
by
the
sole
thought
of
her
happiness
i
love
her
but
i
respect
her
even
more
madame
de
gorne
must
have
told
you
and
i
tell
you
again
that
she
and
i
exchanged
our
first
few
words
last
night
he
continued
in
a
lower
voice
i
respect
her
the
more
inasmuch
as
she
is
exceedingly
unhappy
all
the
world
knows
that
every
minute
of
her
life
was
a
martyrdom
her
husband
persecuted
her
with
ferocious
hatred
and
frantic
jealousy
ask
the
servants
they
will
tell
you
of
the
long
suffering
of
natalie
de
gorne
of
the
blows
which
she
received
and
the
insults
which
she
had
to
endure
i
tried
to
stop
this
torture
by
restoring
to
the
rights
of
appeal
which
the
merest
stranger
may
claim
when
unhappiness
and
injustice
pass
a
certain
limit
i
went
three
times
to
old
de
gorne
and
begged
him
to
interfere
but
i
found
in
him
an
almost
equal
hatred
towards
his
the
hatred
which
many
people
feel
for
anything
beautiful
and
noble
at
last
i
resolved
on
direct
action
and
last
night
i
took
a
step
with
regard
to
mathias
de
gorne
which
was
a
little
unusual
i
admit
but
which
seemed
likely
to
succeed
considering
the
man
character
i
swear
deputy
that
i
had
no
other
intention
than
to
talk
to
mathias
de
gorne
knowing
certain
particulars
of
his
life
which
enabled
me
to
bring
effective
pressure
to
bear
upon
him
i
wished
to
make
use
of
this
advantage
in
order
to
achieve
my
purpose
if
things
turned
out
differently
i
am
not
wholly
to
blame
so
i
went
there
a
little
before
nine
the
servants
i
knew
were
out
he
opened
the
door
himself
he
was
alone
monsieur
said
the
deputy
interrupting
him
you
are
saying
something
as
madame
de
gorne
for
that
matter
did
just
now
which
is
manifestly
opposed
to
the
truth
mathias
de
gorne
did
not
come
home
last
night
until
eleven
we
have
two
definite
proofs
of
this
his
father
evidence
and
the
prints
of
his
feet
in
the
snow
which
fell
from
a
quarter
past
nine
to
eleven
deputy
jérôme
vignal
declared
without
heeding
the
bad
effect
which
his
obstinacy
was
producing
i
am
relating
things
as
they
were
and
not
as
they
may
be
interpreted
but
to
continue
that
clock
marked
ten
minutes
to
nine
when
i
entered
this
room
de
gorne
believing
that
he
was
about
to
be
attacked
had
taken
down
his
gun
i
placed
my
revolver
on
the
table
out
of
reach
of
my
hand
and
sat
down
want
to
speak
to
you
monsieur
i
said
listen
to
me
he
did
not
stir
and
did
not
utter
a
single
syllable
so
i
spoke
and
straightway
crudely
without
any
previous
explanations
which
might
have
softened
the
bluntness
of
my
proposal
i
spoke
the
few
words
which
i
had
prepared
beforehand
have
spent
some
months
monsieur
i
said
making
careful
enquiries
into
your
financial
position
you
have
mortgaged
every
foot
of
your
land
you
have
signed
bills
which
will
shortly
be
falling
due
and
which
it
will
be
absolutely
impossible
for
you
to
honour
you
have
nothing
to
hope
for
from
your
father
whose
own
affairs
are
in
a
very
bad
condition
so
you
are
ruined
i
have
come
to
save
he
watched
me
still
without
speaking
and
sat
down
which
i
took
to
mean
that
my
suggestion
was
not
entirely
displeasing
then
i
took
a
sheaf
of
from
my
pocket
placed
it
before
him
and
continued
is
sixty
thousand
francs
monsieur
i
will
buy
the
its
lands
and
dependencies
and
take
over
the
mortgages
the
sum
named
is
exactly
twice
what
they
are
i
saw
his
eyes
glittering
he
asked
my
conditions
one
i
said
you
go
to
deputy
we
sat
discussing
for
two
hours
it
was
not
that
my
offer
roused
his
indignation
i
should
not
have
risked
it
if
i
had
not
known
with
whom
i
was
dealing
but
he
wanted
more
and
haggled
greedily
though
he
refrained
from
mentioning
the
name
of
madame
de
gorne
to
whom
i
myself
had
not
once
alluded
we
might
have
been
two
men
engaged
in
a
dispute
and
seeking
an
agreement
on
common
ground
whereas
it
was
the
happiness
and
the
whole
destiny
of
a
woman
that
were
at
stake
at
last
weary
of
the
discussion
i
accepted
a
compromise
and
we
came
to
terms
which
i
resolved
to
make
definite
then
and
there
two
letters
were
exchanged
between
us
one
in
which
he
made
the
over
to
me
for
the
sum
which
i
had
paid
him
and
one
which
he
pocketed
immediately
by
which
i
was
to
send
him
as
much
more
in
america
on
the
day
on
which
the
decree
of
divorce
was
pronounced
so
the
affair
was
settled
i
am
sure
that
at
that
moment
he
was
accepting
in
good
faith
he
looked
upon
me
less
as
an
enemy
and
a
rival
than
as
a
man
who
was
doing
him
a
service
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
give
me
the
key
of
the
little
door
which
opens
on
the
fields
so
that
i
might
go
home
by
the
short
cut
unfortunately
while
i
was
picking
up
my
cap
and
greatcoat
i
made
the
mistake
of
leaving
on
the
table
the
letter
of
sale
which
he
had
signed
in
a
moment
mathias
de
gorne
had
seen
the
advantage
which
he
could
take
of
my
slip
he
could
keep
his
property
keep
his
wife
and
keep
the
money
quick
as
lightning
he
tucked
away
the
paper
hit
me
over
the
head
with
the
of
his
gun
threw
the
gun
on
the
floor
and
seized
me
by
the
throat
with
both
hands
he
had
reckoned
without
his
host
i
was
the
stronger
of
the
two
and
after
a
sharp
but
short
struggle
i
mastered
him
and
tied
him
up
with
a
cord
which
i
found
lying
in
a
corner
deputy
if
my
enemy
resolve
was
sudden
mine
was
no
less
so
since
when
all
was
said
he
had
accepted
the
bargain
i
would
force
him
to
keep
it
at
least
in
so
far
as
i
was
interested
a
very
few
steps
brought
me
to
the
first
floor
i
had
not
a
doubt
that
madame
de
gorne
was
there
and
had
heard
the
sound
of
our
discussion
switching
on
the
light
of
my
i
looked
into
three
bedrooms
the
fourth
was
locked
i
knocked
at
the
door
there
was
no
reply
but
this
was
one
of
the
moments
in
which
a
man
allows
no
obstacle
to
stand
in
his
way
i
had
seen
a
hammer
in
one
of
the
rooms
i
picked
it
up
and
smashed
in
the
door
yes
natalie
was
lying
there
on
the
floor
in
a
dead
faint
i
took
her
in
my
arms
carried
her
downstairs
and
went
through
the
kitchen
on
seeing
the
snow
outside
i
at
once
realized
that
my
footprints
would
be
easily
traced
but
what
did
it
matter
was
there
any
reason
why
i
should
put
mathias
de
gorne
off
the
scent
not
at
all
with
the
sixty
thousand
francs
in
his
possession
as
well
as
the
paper
in
which
i
undertook
to
pay
him
a
like
sum
on
the
day
of
his
divorce
to
say
nothing
of
his
house
and
land
he
would
go
away
leaving
natalie
de
gorne
to
me
nothing
was
changed
between
us
except
one
thing
instead
of
awaiting
his
good
pleasure
i
had
at
once
seized
the
precious
pledge
which
i
coveted
what
i
feared
therefore
was
not
so
much
any
subsequent
attack
on
the
part
of
mathias
de
gorne
but
rather
the
indignant
reproaches
of
his
wife
what
would
she
say
when
she
realized
that
she
was
a
prisoner
in
my
hands
the
reasons
why
i
escaped
reproach
madame
de
gorne
has
i
believe
had
the
frankness
to
tell
you
love
calls
forth
love
that
night
in
my
house
broken
by
emotion
she
confessed
her
feeling
for
me
she
loved
me
as
i
loved
her
our
destinies
were
henceforth
mingled
she
and
i
set
out
at
five
this
morning
not
foreseeing
for
an
instant
that
we
were
amenable
to
the
law
jérôme
vignal
story
was
finished
he
had
told
it
straight
off
the
reel
like
a
story
learnt
by
heart
and
incapable
of
revision
in
any
detail
there
was
a
brief
pause
during
which
hortense
whispered
it
all
sounds
quite
possible
and
in
any
case
very
logical
there
are
the
objections
to
come
said
rénine
wait
till
you
hear
them
they
are
very
serious
there
one
in
particular
the
stated
it
at
once
and
what
became
of
de
gorne
in
all
this
mathias
de
gorne
asked
jérôme
yes
you
have
related
with
an
accent
of
great
sincerity
a
series
of
facts
which
i
am
quite
willing
to
admit
unfortunately
you
have
forgotten
a
point
of
the
first
importance
what
became
of
mathias
de
gorne
you
tied
him
up
here
in
this
room
well
this
morning
he
was
gone
of
course
deputy
mathias
de
gorne
accepted
the
bargain
in
the
end
and
went
away
by
what
road
no
doubt
by
the
road
that
leads
to
his
father
house
where
are
his
footprints
the
expanse
of
snow
is
an
impartial
witness
after
your
fight
with
him
we
see
you
on
the
snow
moving
away
why
we
see
him
he
came
and
did
not
go
away
again
where
is
he
there
is
not
a
trace
of
him
or
rather
the
deputy
lowered
his
voice
or
rather
yes
there
are
some
traces
on
the
way
to
the
well
and
around
the
well
traces
which
prove
that
the
last
struggle
of
all
took
place
there
and
after
that
there
is
nothing
not
a
thing
jérôme
shrugged
his
shoulders
you
have
already
mentioned
this
deputy
and
it
implies
a
charge
of
homicide
against
me
i
have
nothing
to
say
to
it
have
you
anything
to
say
to
the
fact
that
your
revolver
was
picked
up
within
fifteen
yards
of
the
well
no
or
to
the
strange
coincidence
between
the
three
shots
heard
in
the
night
and
the
three
cartridges
missing
from
your
revolver
no
deputy
there
was
not
as
you
believe
a
last
struggle
by
the
well
because
i
left
de
gorne
tied
up
in
this
room
and
because
i
also
left
my
revolver
here
on
the
other
hand
if
shots
were
heard
they
were
not
fired
by
me
a
casual
coincidence
therefore
that
a
matter
for
the
police
to
explain
my
only
duty
is
to
tell
the
truth
and
you
are
not
entitled
to
ask
more
of
me
and
if
that
truth
conflicts
with
the
facts
observed
it
means
that
the
facts
are
wrong
mr
deputy
as
you
please
but
until
the
day
when
the
police
are
able
to
make
them
agree
with
your
statements
you
will
understand
that
i
am
obliged
to
keep
you
under
arrest
and
madame
de
gorne
asked
jérôme
greatly
distressed
the
deputy
did
not
reply
he
exchanged
a
few
words
with
the
commissary
of
police
and
then
beckoning
to
a
detective
ordered
him
to
bring
up
one
of
the
two
then
he
turned
to
natalie
madame
you
have
heard
vignal
evidence
it
agrees
word
for
word
with
your
own
vignal
declares
in
particular
that
you
had
fainted
when
he
carried
you
away
but
did
you
remain
unconscious
all
the
way
it
seemed
as
though
jérôme
composure
had
increased
madame
de
assurance
she
replied
i
did
not
come
to
monsieur
until
i
was
at
the
château
it
most
extraordinary
did
you
hear
the
three
shots
which
were
heard
by
almost
every
one
in
the
village
i
did
not
and
did
you
see
nothing
of
what
happened
beside
the
well
nothing
did
happen
vignal
has
told
you
so
then
what
has
become
of
your
husband
i
do
know
come
madame
you
really
must
assist
the
officers
of
the
law
and
at
least
tell
us
what
you
think
do
you
believe
that
there
may
have
been
an
accident
and
that
possibly
de
gorne
who
had
been
to
see
his
father
and
had
more
to
drink
than
usual
lost
his
balance
and
fell
into
the
well
when
my
husband
came
back
from
seeing
his
father
he
was
not
in
the
least
intoxicated
his
father
however
has
stated
that
he
was
his
father
and
he
had
drunk
two
or
three
bottles
of
wine
his
father
is
not
telling
the
truth
but
the
snow
tells
the
truth
madame
said
the
deputy
irritably
and
the
line
of
his
footprints
wavers
from
side
to
side
my
husband
came
in
at
monsieur
before
the
snow
had
begun
to
fall
the
deputy
struck
the
table
with
his
fist
but
really
madame
you
going
right
against
the
evidence
that
sheet
of
snow
can
not
speak
false
i
may
accept
your
denial
of
matters
that
can
not
be
verified
but
these
footprints
in
the
snow
in
the
snow
he
controlled
himself
the
drew
up
outside
the
windows
forming
a
sudden
resolve
he
said
to
natalie
you
will
be
good
enough
to
hold
yourself
at
the
disposal
of
the
authorities
madame
and
to
remain
here
in
the
and
he
made
a
sign
to
the
sergeant
to
remove
jérôme
vignal
in
the
car
the
game
was
lost
for
the
two
lovers
barely
united
they
had
to
separate
and
to
fight
far
away
from
each
other
against
the
most
grievous
accusations
jérôme
took
a
step
towards
natalie
they
exchanged
a
long
sorrowful
look
then
he
bowed
to
her
and
walked
to
the
door
in
the
wake
of
the
sergeant
of
gendarmes
halt
cried
a
voice
sergeant
right
about
turn
jérôme
vignal
stay
where
you
are
the
ruffled
deputy
raised
his
head
as
did
the
other
people
present
the
voice
came
from
the
ceiling
the
window
had
opened
and
rénine
leaning
through
it
was
waving
his
arms
i
wish
to
be
heard
i
have
several
remarks
to
make
especially
in
respect
of
the
zigzag
footprints
it
all
lies
in
that
mathias
had
not
been
drinking
he
had
turned
round
and
put
his
two
legs
through
the
opening
saying
to
hortense
who
tried
to
prevent
him
do
move
no
one
will
disturb
you
and
releasing
his
hold
he
dropped
into
the
room
the
deputy
appeared
dumfounded
but
really
monsieur
who
are
you
where
do
you
come
from
rénine
brushed
the
dust
from
his
clothes
and
replied
excuse
me
deputy
i
ought
to
have
come
the
same
way
as
everybody
else
but
i
was
in
a
hurry
besides
if
i
had
come
in
by
the
door
instead
of
falling
from
the
ceiling
my
words
would
not
have
made
the
same
impression
the
infuriated
deputy
advanced
to
meet
him
who
are
you
prince
rénine
i
was
with
the
sergeant
this
morning
when
he
was
pursuing
his
investigations
was
i
sergeant
since
then
i
have
been
hunting
about
for
information
that
why
wishing
to
be
present
at
the
hearing
i
found
a
corner
in
a
little
private
room
you
were
there
you
had
the
audacity
one
must
needs
be
audacious
when
the
truth
at
stake
if
i
had
not
been
there
i
should
not
have
discovered
just
the
one
little
clue
which
i
missed
i
should
not
have
known
that
mathias
de
gorne
was
not
the
least
bit
drunk
now
that
the
key
to
the
riddle
when
we
know
that
we
know
the
solution
the
deputy
found
himself
in
a
rather
ridiculous
position
since
he
had
failed
to
take
the
necessary
precautions
to
ensure
the
secrecy
of
his
enquiry
it
was
difficult
for
him
to
take
any
steps
against
this
interloper
he
growled
let
have
done
with
this
what
are
you
asking
a
few
minutes
of
your
kind
attention
and
with
what
object
to
establish
the
innocence
of
vignal
and
madame
de
gorne
he
was
wearing
that
calm
air
that
sort
of
indifferent
look
which
was
peculiar
to
him
in
moments
of
actions
when
the
crisis
of
the
drama
depended
solely
upon
himself
hortense
felt
a
thrill
pass
through
her
and
at
once
became
full
of
confidence
they
saved
she
thought
with
sudden
emotion
i
asked
him
to
protect
that
young
creature
and
he
is
saving
her
from
prison
and
despair
jérôme
and
natalie
must
have
experienced
the
same
impression
of
sudden
hope
for
they
had
drawn
nearer
to
each
other
as
though
this
stranger
descended
from
the
clouds
had
already
given
them
the
right
to
clasp
hands
the
deputy
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
prosecution
will
have
every
means
when
the
time
comes
of
establishing
their
innocence
for
itself
you
will
be
called
it
would
be
better
to
establish
it
here
and
now
any
delay
might
lead
to
grievous
consequences
i
happen
to
be
in
a
hurry
two
or
three
minutes
will
do
two
or
three
minutes
to
explain
a
case
like
this
no
longer
i
assure
you
are
you
as
certain
of
it
as
all
that
i
am
now
i
have
been
thinking
hard
since
this
morning
the
deputy
realized
that
this
was
one
of
those
gentry
who
stick
to
you
like
a
leech
and
that
there
was
nothing
for
it
but
to
submit
in
a
rather
bantering
tone
he
asked
does
your
thinking
enable
you
to
tell
us
the
exact
spot
where
mathias
de
gorne
is
at
this
moment
rénine
took
out
his
watch
and
answered
in
paris
mr
deputy
in
paris
alive
then
alive
and
what
is
more
in
the
pink
of
health
i
am
delighted
to
hear
it
but
then
what
the
meaning
of
the
footprints
around
the
well
and
the
presence
of
that
revolver
and
those
three
shots
simply
camouflage
oh
really
camouflage
contrived
by
whom
by
mathias
de
gorne
himself
that
curious
and
with
what
object
with
the
object
of
passing
himself
off
for
dead
and
of
arranging
subsequent
matters
in
such
a
way
that
vignal
was
bound
to
be
accused
of
the
death
the
murder
an
ingenious
theory
the
deputy
agreed
still
in
a
satirical
tone
what
do
you
think
of
it
m
vignal
it
is
a
theory
which
flashed
through
my
own
mind
deputy
replied
jérôme
it
is
quite
likely
that
after
our
struggle
and
after
i
had
gone
mathias
de
gorne
conceived
a
new
plan
by
which
this
time
his
hatred
would
be
fully
gratified
he
both
loved
and
detested
his
wife
he
held
me
in
the
greatest
loathing
this
must
be
his
revenge
his
revenge
would
cost
him
dear
considering
that
according
to
your
statement
mathias
de
gorne
was
to
receive
a
second
sum
of
sixty
thousand
francs
from
you
he
would
receive
that
sum
in
another
quarter
deputy
my
examination
of
the
financial
position
of
the
de
gorne
family
revealed
to
me
the
fact
that
the
father
and
son
had
taken
out
a
policy
in
each
other
favour
with
the
son
dead
or
passing
for
dead
the
father
would
receive
the
and
indemnify
his
son
you
mean
to
say
asked
the
deputy
with
a
smile
that
in
all
this
camouflage
as
you
call
it
de
gorne
the
elder
would
act
as
his
accomplice
rénine
took
up
the
challenge
just
so
deputy
the
father
and
son
are
accomplices
then
we
shall
find
the
son
at
the
father
you
would
have
found
him
there
last
night
what
became
of
him
he
took
the
train
at
pompignat
that
a
mere
supposition
no
a
certainty
a
moral
certainty
perhaps
but
you
admit
there
not
the
slightest
proof
the
deputy
did
not
wait
for
a
reply
he
considered
that
he
had
displayed
an
excessive
goodwill
and
that
patience
has
its
limits
and
he
put
an
end
to
the
interview
not
the
slightest
proof
he
repeated
taking
up
his
hat
and
above
all
above
all
there
nothing
in
what
you
said
that
can
contradict
in
the
very
least
the
evidence
of
that
relentless
witness
the
snow
to
go
to
his
father
mathias
de
gorne
must
have
left
this
house
which
way
did
he
go
hang
it
all
vignal
told
you
by
the
road
which
leads
from
here
to
his
father
there
are
no
tracks
in
the
snow
yes
there
are
but
they
show
him
coming
here
and
not
going
away
from
here
it
the
same
thing
what
of
course
it
is
there
more
than
one
way
of
walking
one
does
always
go
ahead
by
following
one
nose
in
what
other
way
can
one
go
ahead
by
walking
backwards
mr
deputy
these
few
words
spoken
very
simply
but
in
a
clear
tone
which
gave
full
value
to
every
syllable
produced
a
profound
silence
those
present
at
once
grasped
their
extreme
significance
and
by
adapting
it
to
the
actual
happenings
perceived
in
a
flash
the
impenetrable
truth
which
suddenly
appeared
to
be
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
rénine
continued
his
argument
stepping
backwards
in
the
direction
of
the
window
he
said
if
i
want
to
get
to
that
window
i
can
of
course
walk
straight
up
to
it
but
i
can
just
as
easily
turn
my
back
to
it
and
walk
that
way
in
either
case
i
reach
my
goal
and
he
at
once
proceeded
in
a
vigorous
tone
here
the
gist
of
it
all
at
eight
before
the
snow
fell
de
gorne
comes
home
from
his
father
house
vignal
arrives
twenty
minutes
later
there
is
a
long
discussion
and
a
struggle
taking
up
three
hours
in
all
it
is
then
after
vignal
has
carried
off
madame
de
gorne
and
made
his
escape
that
mathias
de
gorne
foaming
at
the
mouth
wild
with
rage
but
suddenly
seeing
his
chance
of
taking
the
most
terrible
revenge
hits
upon
the
ingenious
idea
of
using
against
his
enemy
the
very
snowfall
upon
whose
evidence
you
are
now
relying
he
therefore
plans
his
own
murder
or
rather
the
appearance
of
his
murder
and
of
his
fall
to
the
bottom
of
the
well
and
makes
off
backwards
step
by
step
thus
recording
his
arrival
instead
of
his
departure
on
the
white
page
the
deputy
sneered
no
longer
this
eccentric
intruder
suddenly
appeared
to
him
in
the
light
of
a
person
worthy
of
attention
whom
it
would
not
do
to
make
fun
of
he
asked
and
how
could
he
have
left
his
father
house
in
a
trap
quite
simply
who
drove
it
the
father
this
morning
the
sergeant
and
i
saw
the
trap
and
spoke
to
the
father
who
was
going
to
market
as
usual
the
son
was
hidden
under
the
tilt
he
took
the
train
at
pompignat
and
is
in
paris
by
now
rénine
explanation
as
promised
had
taken
hardly
five
minutes
he
had
based
it
solely
on
logic
and
the
probabilities
of
the
case
and
yet
not
a
jot
was
left
of
the
distressing
mystery
in
which
they
were
floundering
the
darkness
was
dispelled
the
whole
truth
appeared
madame
de
gorne
wept
for
joy
and
jérôme
vignal
thanked
the
good
genius
who
was
changing
the
course
of
events
with
a
stroke
of
his
magic
wand
shall
we
examine
those
footprints
together
mr
deputy
asked
rénine
do
you
mind
the
mistake
which
the
sergeant
and
i
made
this
morning
was
to
investigate
only
the
footprints
left
by
the
alleged
murderer
and
to
neglect
mathias
de
gorne
why
indeed
should
they
have
attracted
our
attention
yet
it
was
precisely
there
that
the
crux
of
the
whole
affair
was
to
be
found
they
stepped
into
the
orchard
and
went
to
the
well
it
did
not
need
a
long
examination
to
observe
that
many
of
the
footprints
were
awkward
hesitating
too
deeply
sunk
at
the
heel
and
toe
and
differing
from
one
another
in
the
angle
at
which
the
feet
were
turned
this
clumsiness
was
unavoidable
said
rénine
mathias
de
gorne
would
have
needed
a
regular
apprenticeship
before
his
backward
progress
could
have
equalled
his
ordinary
gait
and
both
his
father
and
he
must
have
been
aware
of
this
at
least
as
regards
the
zigzags
which
you
see
here
since
old
de
gorne
went
out
of
his
way
to
tell
the
sergeant
that
his
son
had
had
too
much
drink
and
he
added
indeed
it
was
the
detection
of
this
falsehood
that
suddenly
enlightened
me
when
madame
de
gorne
stated
that
her
husband
was
not
drunk
i
thought
of
the
footprints
and
guessed
the
truth
the
deputy
frankly
accepted
his
part
in
the
matter
and
began
to
laugh
there
nothing
left
for
it
but
to
send
detectives
after
the
bogus
corpse
on
what
grounds
mr
deputy
asked
rénine
mathias
de
gorne
has
committed
no
offence
against
the
law
there
nothing
criminal
in
trampling
the
soil
around
a
well
in
shifting
the
position
of
a
revolver
that
belong
to
you
in
firing
three
shots
or
in
walking
backwards
to
father
house
what
can
we
ask
of
him
the
sixty
thousand
francs
i
presume
that
this
is
not
vignal
intention
and
that
he
does
not
mean
to
bring
a
charge
against
him
certainly
not
said
jérôme
well
what
then
the
in
favour
of
the
survivor
but
there
would
be
no
misdemeanour
unless
the
father
claimed
payment
and
i
should
be
greatly
surprised
if
he
did
hullo
here
the
old
chap
is
you
soon
know
all
about
it
old
de
gorne
was
coming
along
gesticulating
as
he
walked
his
features
were
screwed
up
to
express
sorrow
and
anger
where
my
son
he
cried
it
seems
the
brute
killed
him
my
poor
mathias
dead
oh
that
scoundrel
of
a
vignal
and
he
shook
his
fist
at
jérôme
the
deputy
said
bluntly
a
word
with
you
de
gorne
do
you
intend
to
claim
your
rights
under
a
certain
well
what
do
think
said
the
old
man
off
his
guard
the
fact
is
your
son
not
dead
people
are
even
saying
that
you
were
a
partner
in
his
little
schemes
and
that
you
stuffed
him
under
the
tilt
of
your
trap
and
drove
him
to
the
station
the
old
fellow
spat
on
the
ground
stretched
out
his
hand
as
though
he
were
going
to
take
a
solemn
oath
stood
for
an
instant
without
moving
and
then
suddenly
changing
his
mind
and
his
tactics
with
ingenuous
cynicism
he
relaxed
his
features
assumed
a
conciliatory
attitude
and
burst
out
laughing
that
blackguard
mathias
so
he
tried
to
pass
himself
off
as
dead
what
a
rascal
and
he
reckoned
on
me
to
collect
the
and
send
it
to
him
as
if
i
should
be
capable
of
such
a
low
dirty
trick
you
know
me
my
boy
and
without
waiting
for
more
shaking
with
merriment
like
a
jolly
old
fellow
amused
by
a
funny
story
he
took
his
departure
not
forgetting
however
to
set
his
great
boots
on
each
of
the
compromising
footprints
which
his
son
had
left
behind
him
later
when
rénine
went
back
to
the
manor
to
let
hortense
out
he
found
that
she
had
disappeared
he
called
and
asked
for
her
at
her
cousin
ermelin
hortense
sent
down
word
asking
him
to
excuse
her
she
was
feeling
a
little
tired
and
was
lying
down
capital
thought
rénine
capital
she
avoids
me
therefore
she
loves
me

my
dearest
friend
there
has
been
no
letter
from
you
for
a
fortnight
so
i
do
expect
now
to
receive
one
for
that
troublesome
date
of
the
of
december
which
we
fixed
as
the
last
day
of
our
partnership
i
rather
wish
it
would
come
because
you
will
then
be
released
from
a
contract
which
no
longer
seems
to
give
you
pleasure
to
me
the
seven
battles
which
we
fought
and
won
together
were
a
time
of
endless
delight
and
enthusiasm
i
was
living
beside
you
i
was
conscious
of
all
the
good
which
that
more
active
and
stirring
existence
was
doing
you
my
happiness
was
so
great
that
i
dared
not
speak
of
it
to
you
or
let
you
see
anything
of
my
secret
feelings
except
my
desire
to
please
you
and
my
passionate
devotion
you
have
had
enough
of
your
brother
in
arms
your
will
shall
be
law
but
though
i
bow
to
your
decree
may
i
remind
i
you
what
it
was
that
i
always
believed
our
final
adventure
would
be
may
i
repeat
your
words
not
one
of
which
i
have
forgotten
demand
you
said
you
shall
restore
to
me
a
small
antique
clasp
made
of
a
cornelian
set
in
a
filigree
mount
it
came
to
me
from
my
mother
and
every
one
knew
that
it
used
to
bring
her
happiness
and
me
too
since
the
day
when
it
vanished
from
my
i
have
had
nothing
but
unhappiness
restore
it
to
me
my
good
genius
and
when
i
asked
you
when
the
clasp
had
disappeared
you
answered
with
a
laugh
years
ago
or
eight
or
nine
i
do
know
exactly
i
do
know
when
i
do
know
how
i
know
nothing
about
it
you
were
challenging
me
were
you
not
and
you
set
me
that
condition
because
it
was
one
which
i
could
not
fulfil
nevertheless
i
promised
and
i
should
like
to
keep
my
promise
what
i
have
tried
to
do
in
order
to
place
life
before
you
in
a
more
favourable
light
would
seem
purposeless
if
your
confidence
feels
the
lack
of
this
talisman
to
which
you
attach
so
great
a
value
we
must
not
laugh
at
these
little
superstitions
they
are
often
the
mainspring
of
our
best
actions
dear
friend
if
you
had
helped
me
i
should
have
achieved
yet
one
more
victory
alone
and
hard
pushed
by
the
proximity
of
the
date
i
have
failed
not
however
without
placing
things
on
such
a
footing
that
the
undertaking
if
you
care
to
follow
it
up
has
the
greatest
chance
of
success
and
you
will
follow
it
up
wo
you
we
have
entered
into
a
mutual
agreement
which
we
are
bound
to
honour
it
behooves
us
within
a
fixed
time
to
inscribe
in
the
book
of
our
common
life
eight
good
stories
to
which
we
shall
have
brought
energy
logic
perseverance
some
subtlety
and
occasionally
a
little
heroism
this
is
the
eighth
of
them
it
is
for
you
to
act
so
that
it
may
be
written
in
its
proper
place
on
the
of
december
before
the
clock
strikes
eight
in
the
evening
and
on
that
day
you
will
act
as
i
shall
now
tell
you
first
of
all
and
above
all
my
dear
do
not
complain
that
my
instructions
are
fanciful
each
of
them
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
success
first
of
all
cut
in
your
cousin
garden
three
slender
lengths
of
rush
plait
them
together
and
bind
up
the
two
ends
so
as
to
make
a
rude
switch
like
a
child
when
you
get
to
paris
buy
a
long
necklace
of
jet
beads
cut
into
facets
and
shorten
it
so
that
it
consists
of
beads
of
almost
equal
size
under
your
winter
cloak
wear
a
blue
woollen
gown
on
your
head
a
toque
with
red
leaves
on
it
round
your
neck
a
feather
boa
no
gloves
no
rings
in
the
afternoon
take
a
cab
along
the
left
bank
of
the
river
to
the
church
of
at
four
exactly
there
will
be
near
the
basin
just
inside
the
church
an
old
woman
dressed
in
black
saying
her
prayers
on
a
silver
rosary
she
will
offer
you
holy
water
give
her
your
necklace
she
will
count
the
beads
and
hand
it
back
to
you
after
this
you
will
walk
behind
her
you
will
cross
an
arm
of
the
seine
and
she
will
lead
you
down
a
lonely
street
in
the
ile
to
a
house
which
you
will
enter
by
yourself
on
the
of
this
house
you
will
find
a
youngish
man
with
a
very
pasty
complexion
take
off
your
cloak
and
then
say
to
him
have
come
to
fetch
my
clasp
do
not
be
astonished
by
his
agitation
or
dismay
keep
calm
in
his
presence
if
he
questions
you
if
he
wants
to
know
your
reason
for
applying
to
him
or
what
impels
you
to
make
that
request
give
him
no
explanation
your
replies
must
be
confined
to
these
brief
formulas
have
come
to
fetch
what
belongs
to
me
i
do
know
you
i
do
know
your
name
but
i
am
obliged
to
come
to
you
like
this
i
must
have
my
clasp
returned
to
me
i
must
i
honestly
believe
that
if
you
have
the
firmness
not
to
swerve
from
that
attitude
whatever
farce
the
man
may
play
you
will
be
completely
successful
but
the
contest
must
be
a
short
one
and
the
issue
will
depend
solely
on
your
confidence
in
yourself
and
your
certainty
of
success
it
will
be
a
sort
of
match
in
which
you
must
defeat
your
opponent
in
the
first
round
if
you
remain
impassive
you
will
win
if
you
show
hesitation
or
uneasiness
you
can
do
nothing
against
him
he
will
escape
you
and
regain
the
upper
hand
after
a
first
moment
of
distress
and
the
game
will
be
lost
in
a
few
minutes
there
is
no
midway
house
between
victory
or
defeat
in
the
latter
event
you
would
be
obliged
i
beg
you
to
pardon
me
for
saying
so
again
to
accept
my
collaboration
i
offer
it
you
in
advance
my
dear
and
without
any
conditions
while
stating
quite
plainly
that
all
that
i
have
been
able
to
do
for
you
and
all
that
i
may
yet
do
gives
me
no
other
right
than
that
of
thanking
you
and
devoting
myself
more
than
ever
to
the
woman
who
represents
my
joy
my
whole
life
hortense
after
reading
the
letter
folded
it
up
and
put
it
away
at
the
back
of
a
drawer
saying
in
a
resolute
voice
i
go
to
begin
with
although
she
had
formerly
attached
some
slight
importance
to
this
trinket
which
she
had
regarded
as
a
mascot
she
felt
very
little
interest
in
it
now
that
the
period
of
her
trials
was
apparently
at
an
end
she
could
not
forget
that
figure
eight
which
was
the
serial
number
of
the
next
adventure
to
launch
herself
upon
it
meant
taking
up
the
interrupted
chain
going
back
to
rénine
and
giving
him
a
pledge
which
with
his
powers
of
suggestion
he
would
know
how
to
turn
to
account
two
days
before
the
of
december
she
was
still
in
the
same
frame
of
mind
so
she
was
on
the
morning
of
the
but
suddenly
without
even
having
to
contend
against
preliminary
subterfuges
she
ran
out
into
the
garden
cut
three
lengths
of
rush
plaited
them
as
she
used
to
do
in
her
childhood
and
at
twelve
had
herself
driven
to
the
station
she
was
uplifted
by
an
eager
curiosity
she
was
unable
to
resist
all
the
amusing
and
novel
sensations
which
the
adventure
proposed
by
rénine
promised
her
it
was
really
too
tempting
the
jet
necklace
the
toque
with
the
autumn
leaves
the
old
woman
with
the
silver
rosary
how
could
she
resist
their
mysterious
appeal
and
how
could
she
refuse
this
opportunity
of
showing
rénine
what
she
was
capable
of
doing
and
then
after
all
she
said
to
herself
laughing
he
summoning
me
to
paris
now
eight
is
dangerous
to
me
at
a
spot
three
hundred
miles
from
paris
in
that
old
deserted
château
de
halingre
but
nowhere
else
the
only
clock
that
can
strike
the
threatening
hour
is
down
there
under
lock
and
key
a
prisoner
she
reached
paris
that
evening
on
the
morning
of
the
she
went
out
and
bought
a
jet
necklace
which
she
reduced
to
beads
put
on
a
blue
gown
and
a
toque
with
red
leaves
and
at
four
precisely
entered
the
church
of
her
heart
was
throbbing
violently
this
time
she
was
alone
and
how
acutely
she
now
felt
the
strength
of
that
support
which
from
unreflecting
fear
rather
than
any
reasonable
motive
she
had
thrust
aside
she
looked
around
her
almost
hoping
to
see
him
but
there
was
no
one
there
no
one
except
an
old
lady
in
black
standing
beside
the
holy
water
basin
hortense
went
up
to
her
the
old
lady
who
held
a
silver
rosary
in
her
hands
offered
her
holy
water
and
then
began
to
count
the
beads
of
the
necklace
which
hortense
gave
her
she
whispered
that
right
come
without
another
word
she
toddled
along
under
the
light
of
the
crossed
the
pont
des
tournelles
to
the
ile
and
went
down
an
empty
street
leading
to
a
where
she
stopped
in
front
of
an
old
house
with
balconies
go
in
she
said
and
the
old
lady
went
away
hortense
now
saw
a
shop
which
occupied
almost
the
whole
of
the
and
whose
windows
blazing
with
electric
light
displayed
a
huddled
array
of
old
furniture
and
antiquities
she
stood
there
for
a
few
seconds
gazing
at
it
absently
a
bore
the
words
the
mercury
together
with
the
name
of
the
owner
of
the
shop
pancaldi
higher
up
on
a
projecting
cornice
which
ran
on
a
level
with
the
first
floor
a
small
niche
sheltered
a
mercury
poised
on
one
foot
with
wings
to
his
sandals
and
the
caduceus
in
his
hand
who
as
hortense
noted
was
leaning
a
little
too
far
forward
in
the
ardour
of
his
flight
and
ought
logically
to
have
lost
his
balance
and
taken
a
header
into
the
street
now
she
said
under
her
breath
she
turned
the
handle
of
the
door
and
walked
in
despite
the
ringing
of
the
bells
actuated
by
the
opening
door
no
one
came
to
meet
her
the
shop
seemed
to
be
empty
however
at
the
extreme
end
there
was
a
room
at
the
back
of
the
shop
and
after
that
another
both
crammed
with
furniture
and
many
of
which
looked
very
valuable
hortense
followed
a
narrow
gangway
which
twisted
and
turned
between
two
walls
built
up
of
cupboards
cabinets
and
went
up
two
steps
and
found
herself
in
the
last
room
of
all
a
man
was
sitting
at
a
and
looking
through
some
without
turning
his
head
he
said
i
am
at
your
service
madam
please
look
round
you
this
room
contained
nothing
but
articles
of
a
special
character
which
gave
it
the
appearance
of
some
alchemist
laboratory
in
the
middle
ages
stuffed
owls
skeletons
skulls
copper
alembics
astrolabes
and
all
around
hanging
on
the
walls
amulets
of
every
description
mainly
hands
of
ivory
or
coral
with
two
fingers
pointing
to
ward
off
are
you
wanting
anything
in
particular
madam
asked
pancaldi
closing
his
desk
and
rising
from
his
chair
it
the
man
thought
hortense
he
had
in
fact
an
uncommonly
pasty
complexion
a
little
forked
beard
flecked
with
grey
lengthened
his
face
which
was
surmounted
by
a
bald
pallid
forehead
beneath
which
gleamed
a
pair
of
small
prominent
restless
shifty
eyes
hortense
who
had
not
removed
her
veil
or
cloak
replied
i
want
a
clasp
they
in
this
he
said
leading
the
way
to
the
connecting
room
hortense
glanced
over
the
glass
case
and
said
no
no
i
do
see
what
i
looking
for
i
do
want
just
any
clasp
but
a
clasp
which
i
lost
out
of
a
some
years
ago
and
which
i
have
to
look
for
here
she
was
astounded
to
see
the
commotion
displayed
on
his
features
his
eyes
became
haggard
here
i
do
think
you
are
in
the
least
likely
what
sort
of
clasp
is
it
a
cornelian
mounted
in
gold
filigree
of
the
period
i
do
understand
he
stammered
why
do
you
come
to
me
she
now
removed
her
veil
and
laid
aside
her
cloak
he
stepped
back
as
though
terrified
by
the
sight
of
her
and
whispered
the
blue
gown
the
toque
and
can
i
believe
my
eyes
the
jet
necklace
it
was
perhaps
the
formed
of
three
rushes
that
excited
him
most
violently
he
pointed
his
finger
at
it
began
to
stagger
where
he
stood
and
ended
by
beating
the
air
with
his
arms
like
a
drowning
man
and
fainting
away
in
a
chair
hortense
did
not
move
whatever
farce
he
may
play
rénine
had
written
have
the
courage
to
remain
impassive
perhaps
he
was
not
playing
a
farce
nevertheless
she
forced
herself
to
be
calm
and
indifferent
this
lasted
for
a
minute
or
two
after
which
pancaldi
recovered
from
his
swoon
wiped
away
the
perspiration
streaming
down
his
forehead
and
striving
to
control
himself
resumed
in
a
trembling
voice
why
do
you
apply
to
me
because
the
clasp
is
in
your
possession
who
told
you
that
he
said
without
denying
the
accusation
how
do
you
know
i
know
because
it
is
so
nobody
has
told
me
anything
i
came
here
positive
that
i
should
find
my
clasp
and
with
the
immovable
determination
to
take
it
away
with
me
but
do
you
know
me
do
you
know
my
name
i
do
know
you
i
did
not
know
your
name
before
i
read
it
over
your
shop
to
me
you
are
simply
the
man
who
is
going
to
give
me
back
what
belongs
to
me
he
was
greatly
agitated
he
kept
on
walking
to
and
fro
in
a
small
empty
space
surrounded
by
a
circle
of
furniture
at
which
he
hit
out
idiotically
at
the
risk
of
bringing
it
down
hortense
felt
that
she
had
the
whip
hand
of
him
and
profiting
by
his
confusion
she
said
suddenly
in
a
commanding
and
threatening
tone
where
is
the
thing
you
must
give
it
back
to
me
i
insist
upon
it
pancaldi
gave
way
to
a
moment
of
despair
he
folded
his
hands
and
mumbled
a
few
words
of
entreaty
then
defeated
and
suddenly
resigned
he
said
more
distinctly
you
insist
i
do
you
must
give
it
to
me
yes
yes
i
must
i
agree
speak
she
ordered
more
harshly
still
speak
no
but
write
i
will
write
my
secret
and
that
will
be
the
end
of
me
he
turned
to
his
desk
and
feverishly
wrote
a
few
lines
on
a
sheet
of
paper
which
he
put
into
an
envelope
and
sealed
it
see
he
said
here
my
secret
it
was
my
whole
life
and
so
saying
he
suddenly
pressed
against
his
temple
a
revolver
which
he
had
produced
from
under
a
pile
of
papers
and
fired
with
a
quick
movement
hortense
struck
up
his
arm
the
bullet
struck
the
mirror
of
a
but
pancaldi
collapsed
and
began
to
groan
as
though
he
were
wounded
hortense
made
a
great
effort
not
to
lose
her
composure
rénine
warned
me
she
reflected
the
man
a
he
has
kept
the
envelope
he
has
kept
his
revolver
i
wo
be
taken
in
by
him
nevertheless
she
realized
that
despite
his
apparent
calmness
the
attempt
at
suicide
and
the
had
completely
unnerved
her
all
her
energies
were
dispersed
like
the
sticks
of
a
bundle
whose
string
has
been
cut
and
she
had
a
painful
impression
that
the
man
who
was
grovelling
at
her
feet
was
in
reality
slowly
getting
the
better
of
her
she
sat
down
exhausted
as
rénine
had
foretold
the
duel
had
not
lasted
longer
than
a
few
minutes
but
it
was
she
who
had
succumbed
thanks
to
her
feminine
nerves
and
at
the
very
moment
when
she
felt
entitled
to
believe
that
she
had
won
the
man
pancaldi
was
fully
aware
of
this
and
without
troubling
to
invent
a
transition
he
ceased
his
jeremiads
leapt
to
his
feet
cut
a
sort
of
agile
caper
before
hortense
eyes
and
cried
in
a
jeering
tone
now
we
are
going
to
have
a
little
chat
but
it
would
be
a
nuisance
to
be
at
the
mercy
of
the
first
passing
customer
would
it
he
ran
to
the
opened
it
and
pulled
down
the
iron
shutter
which
closed
the
shop
then
still
hopping
and
skipping
he
came
back
to
hortense
oof
i
really
thought
i
was
done
for
one
more
effort
madam
and
you
would
have
pulled
it
off
but
then
i
such
a
simple
chap
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
had
come
from
the
back
of
beyond
as
an
emissary
of
providence
to
call
me
to
account
and
like
a
fool
i
was
about
to
give
the
thing
back
ah
mlle
hortense
let
me
call
you
so
i
used
to
know
you
by
that
name
mlle
hortense
what
you
lack
to
use
a
vulgar
expression
is
gut
he
sat
down
beside
her
and
with
a
malicious
look
said
savagely
the
time
has
come
to
speak
out
who
contrived
this
business
not
you
eh
it
not
in
your
style
then
who
i
have
always
been
honest
in
my
life
scrupulously
honest
except
once
in
the
matter
of
that
clasp
and
whereas
i
thought
the
story
was
buried
and
forgotten
here
it
is
suddenly
raked
up
again
why
that
what
i
want
to
know
hortense
was
no
longer
even
attempting
to
fight
he
was
bringing
to
bear
upon
her
all
his
virile
strength
all
his
spite
all
his
fears
all
the
threats
expressed
in
his
furious
gestures
and
on
his
features
which
were
both
ridiculous
and
evil
speak
i
want
to
know
if
i
have
a
secret
foe
let
me
defend
myself
against
him
who
is
he
who
sent
you
here
who
urged
you
to
take
action
is
it
a
rival
incensed
by
my
good
luck
who
wants
in
his
turn
to
benefit
by
the
clasp
speak
ca
you
damn
it
all
or
i
swear
by
heaven
make
you
she
had
an
idea
that
he
was
reaching
out
for
his
revolver
and
stepped
back
holding
her
arms
before
her
in
the
hope
of
escaping
they
thus
struggled
against
each
other
and
hortense
who
was
becoming
more
and
more
frightened
not
so
much
of
the
attack
as
of
her
distorted
face
was
beginning
to
scream
when
pancaldi
suddenly
stood
motionless
with
his
arms
before
him
his
fingers
outstretched
and
his
eyes
staring
above
hortense
head
who
there
how
did
you
get
in
he
asked
in
a
stifled
voice
hortense
did
not
even
need
to
turn
round
to
feel
assured
that
rénine
was
coming
to
her
assistance
and
that
it
was
his
inexplicable
appearance
that
was
causing
the
dealer
such
dismay
as
a
matter
of
fact
a
slender
figure
stole
through
a
heap
of
easy
chairs
and
sofas
and
rénine
came
forward
with
a
tranquil
step
who
are
you
repeated
pancaldi
where
do
you
come
from
from
up
there
he
said
very
amiably
pointing
to
the
ceiling
from
up
there
yes
from
the
first
floor
i
have
been
the
tenant
of
the
floor
above
this
for
the
past
three
months
i
heard
a
noise
just
now
some
one
was
calling
out
for
help
so
i
came
down
but
how
did
you
get
in
here
by
the
staircase
what
staircase
the
iron
staircase
at
the
end
of
the
shop
the
man
who
owned
it
before
you
had
a
flat
on
my
floor
and
used
to
go
up
and
down
by
that
hidden
staircase
you
had
the
door
shut
off
i
opened
it
but
by
what
right
sir
it
amounts
to
breaking
in
breaking
in
is
allowed
when
there
a
to
be
rescued
once
more
who
are
you
prince
rénine
and
a
friend
of
this
lady
said
rénine
bending
over
hortense
and
kissing
her
hand
pancaldi
seemed
to
be
choking
and
mumbled
oh
i
understand
you
instigated
the
plot
it
was
you
who
sent
the
lady
it
was
pancaldi
it
was
and
what
are
your
intentions
my
intentions
are
irreproachable
no
violence
simply
a
little
interview
when
that
is
over
you
will
hand
over
what
i
in
my
turn
have
come
to
fetch
what
the
clasp
that
never
shouted
the
dealer
do
say
no
it
a
foregone
conclusion
no
power
on
earth
sir
can
compel
me
to
do
such
a
thing
shall
we
send
for
your
wife
madame
pancaldi
will
perhaps
realize
the
position
better
than
you
do
the
idea
of
no
longer
being
alone
with
this
unexpected
adversary
seemed
to
appeal
to
pancaldi
there
was
a
bell
on
the
table
beside
him
he
struck
it
three
times
capital
exclaimed
rénine
you
see
my
dear
pancaldi
is
becoming
quite
amiable
not
a
trace
left
of
the
devil
broken
loose
who
was
going
for
you
just
now
no
pancaldi
only
has
to
find
himself
dealing
with
a
man
to
recover
his
qualities
of
courtesy
and
kindness
a
perfect
sheep
which
does
not
mean
that
things
will
go
quite
of
themselves
far
from
it
no
more
obstinate
animal
than
a
sheep
right
at
the
end
of
the
shop
between
the
dealer
and
the
winding
staircase
a
curtain
was
raised
admitting
a
woman
who
was
holding
a
door
open
she
might
have
been
thirty
years
of
age
very
simply
dressed
she
looked
with
the
apron
on
her
more
like
a
cook
than
like
the
mistress
of
a
household
but
she
had
an
attractive
face
and
a
pleasing
figure
hortense
who
had
followed
rénine
was
surprised
to
recognize
her
as
a
maid
whom
she
had
had
in
her
service
when
a
girl
what
is
that
you
lucienne
are
you
madame
pancaldi
the
newcomer
looked
at
her
recognized
her
also
and
seemed
embarrassed
rénine
said
to
her
your
husband
and
i
need
your
assistance
madame
pancaldi
to
settle
a
rather
complicated
matter
a
matter
in
which
you
played
an
important
part
she
came
forward
without
a
word
obviously
ill
at
ease
asking
her
husband
who
did
not
take
his
eyes
off
her
what
is
it
what
do
they
want
with
me
what
is
he
referring
to
it
about
the
clasp
pancaldi
whispered
under
his
breath
these
few
words
were
enough
to
make
madame
pancaldi
realize
to
the
full
the
seriousness
of
her
position
and
she
did
not
try
to
keep
her
countenance
or
to
retort
with
futile
protests
she
sank
into
a
chair
sighing
oh
that
it
i
understand
mlle
hortense
has
found
the
track
oh
it
all
up
with
us
there
was
a
moment
respite
the
struggle
between
the
adversaries
had
hardly
begun
before
the
husband
and
wife
adopted
the
attitude
of
defeated
persons
whose
only
hope
lay
in
the
victor
clemency
staring
motionless
before
her
madame
pancaldi
began
to
cry
rénine
bent
over
her
and
said
do
you
mind
if
we
go
over
the
case
from
the
beginning
we
shall
then
see
things
more
clearly
and
i
am
sure
that
our
interview
will
lead
to
a
perfectly
natural
solution
this
is
how
things
happened
nine
years
ago
when
you
were
lady
maid
to
mlle
hortense
in
the
country
you
made
the
acquaintance
of
pancaldi
who
soon
became
your
lover
you
were
both
of
you
corsicans
in
other
words
you
came
from
a
country
where
superstitions
are
very
strong
and
where
questions
of
good
and
bad
luck
the
evil
eye
and
spells
and
charms
exert
a
profound
influence
over
the
lives
of
one
and
all
now
it
was
said
that
your
young
mistress
clasp
had
always
brought
luck
to
its
owners
that
was
why
in
a
weak
moment
prompted
by
pancaldi
you
stole
the
clasp
six
months
afterwards
you
became
madame
pancaldi
that
is
your
whole
story
is
it
not
told
in
a
few
sentences
the
whole
story
of
two
people
who
would
have
remained
honest
members
of
society
if
they
had
been
able
to
resist
that
casual
temptation
i
need
not
tell
you
how
you
both
succeeded
in
life
and
how
possessing
the
talisman
believing
its
powers
and
trusting
in
yourselves
you
rose
to
the
first
rank
of
antiquarians
owning
this
shop
the
mercury
you
attribute
the
success
of
your
undertakings
to
that
clasp
to
lose
it
would
to
your
eyes
spell
bankruptcy
and
poverty
your
whole
life
has
been
centred
upon
it
it
is
your
fetish
it
is
the
little
household
god
who
watches
over
you
and
guides
your
steps
it
is
there
somewhere
hidden
in
this
jungle
and
no
one
of
course
would
ever
have
suspected
anything
for
i
repeat
you
are
decent
people
but
for
this
one
lapse
if
an
accident
had
not
led
me
to
look
into
your
affairs
rénine
paused
and
continued
that
was
two
months
ago
two
months
of
minute
investigations
which
presented
no
difficulty
to
me
because
having
discovered
your
trail
i
hired
the
flat
overhead
and
was
able
to
use
that
staircase
but
all
the
same
two
months
wasted
to
a
certain
extent
because
i
have
not
yet
succeeded
and
heaven
knows
how
i
have
ransacked
this
shop
of
yours
there
is
not
a
piece
of
furniture
that
i
have
left
unsearched
not
a
plank
in
the
floor
that
i
have
not
inspected
all
to
no
purpose
yes
there
was
one
thing
an
incidental
discovery
in
a
secret
recess
in
your
pancaldi
i
turned
up
a
little
in
which
you
have
set
down
your
remorse
your
uneasiness
your
fear
of
punishment
and
your
dread
of
wrath
it
was
highly
imprudent
of
you
pancaldi
people
do
write
such
confessions
and
above
all
they
do
leave
them
lying
about
be
this
as
it
may
i
read
them
and
i
noted
one
passage
which
struck
me
as
particularly
important
and
was
of
use
to
me
in
preparing
my
plan
of
campaign
she
come
to
me
the
woman
whom
i
robbed
should
she
come
to
me
as
i
saw
her
in
her
garden
while
lucienne
was
taking
the
clasp
should
she
appear
to
me
wearing
the
blue
gown
and
the
toque
of
red
leaves
with
the
jet
necklace
and
the
whip
of
three
plaited
rushes
which
she
was
carrying
that
day
should
she
appear
to
me
thus
and
say
i
have
come
to
claim
my
property
then
i
shall
understand
that
her
conduct
is
inspired
from
on
high
and
that
i
must
obey
the
decree
of
providence
that
is
what
is
written
in
your
book
pancaldi
and
it
explains
the
conduct
of
the
lady
whom
you
call
mlle
hortense
acting
on
my
instructions
and
in
accordance
with
the
setting
thought
out
by
yourself
she
came
to
you
from
the
back
of
beyond
to
use
your
own
expression
a
little
more
on
her
part
and
you
know
that
she
would
have
won
the
day
unfortunately
you
are
a
wonderful
actor
your
sham
suicide
put
her
out
and
you
understood
that
this
was
not
a
decree
of
providence
but
simply
an
offensive
on
the
part
of
your
former
victim
i
had
no
choice
therefore
but
to
intervene
here
i
am
and
now
let
finish
the
business
pancaldi
that
clasp
no
said
the
dealer
who
seemed
to
recover
all
his
energy
at
the
very
thought
of
restoring
the
clasp
and
you
madame
pancaldi
i
do
know
where
it
is
the
wife
declared
very
well
then
let
us
come
to
deeds
madame
pancaldi
you
have
a
son
of
seven
whom
you
love
with
all
your
heart
this
is
thursday
and
as
on
every
thursday
your
little
boy
is
to
come
home
alone
from
his
aunt
two
of
my
friends
are
posted
on
the
road
by
which
he
returns
and
in
the
absence
of
instructions
to
the
contrary
will
kidnap
him
as
he
passes
madame
pancaldi
lost
her
head
at
once
my
son
oh
please
please
not
that
i
swear
that
i
know
nothing
my
husband
would
never
consent
to
confide
in
me
rénine
continued
next
point
this
evening
i
shall
lodge
an
information
with
the
public
prosecutor
evidence
the
confessions
in
the
consequences
action
by
the
police
search
of
the
premises
and
the
rest
pancaldi
was
silent
the
others
had
a
feeling
that
all
these
threats
did
not
affect
him
and
that
protected
by
his
fetish
he
believed
himself
to
be
invulnerable
but
his
wife
fell
on
her
knees
at
rénine
feet
and
stammered
no
no
i
entreat
you
it
would
mean
going
to
prison
and
i
want
to
go
and
then
my
son
oh
i
entreat
you
hortense
seized
with
compassion
took
rénine
to
one
side
poor
woman
let
me
intercede
for
her
set
your
mind
at
rest
he
said
nothing
is
going
to
happen
to
her
son
but
your
two
friends
sheer
bluff
your
application
to
the
public
prosecutor
a
mere
threat
then
what
are
you
trying
to
do
to
frighten
them
out
of
their
wits
in
the
hope
of
making
them
drop
a
remark
a
word
which
will
tell
us
what
we
want
to
know
we
tried
every
other
means
this
is
the
last
and
it
is
a
method
which
i
find
nearly
always
succeeds
remember
our
adventures
but
if
the
word
which
you
expect
to
hear
is
not
spoken
it
must
be
spoken
said
rénine
in
a
low
voice
we
must
finish
the
matter
the
hour
is
at
hand
his
eyes
met
hers
and
she
blushed
crimson
at
the
thought
that
the
hour
to
which
he
was
alluding
was
the
eighth
and
that
he
had
no
other
object
than
to
finish
the
matter
before
that
eighth
hour
struck
so
you
see
on
the
one
hand
what
you
are
risking
he
said
to
the
pancaldi
pair
the
disappearance
of
your
child
and
prison
prison
for
certain
since
there
is
the
book
with
its
confessions
and
now
on
the
other
hand
here
my
offer
twenty
thousand
francs
if
you
hand
over
the
clasp
immediately
this
minute
remember
it
is
worth
three
louis
no
reply
madame
pancaldi
was
crying
rénine
resumed
pausing
between
each
proposal
i
double
my
offer
i
treble
it
hang
it
all
pancaldi
unreasonable
i
suppose
you
want
me
to
make
it
a
round
sum
all
right
a
hundred
thousand
francs
he
held
out
his
hand
as
if
there
was
no
doubt
that
they
would
give
him
the
clasp
madame
pancaldi
was
the
first
to
yield
and
did
so
with
a
sudden
outburst
of
rage
against
her
husband
well
confess
ca
you
speak
up
where
have
you
hidden
it
look
here
you
are
going
to
be
obstinate
what
if
you
are
it
means
ruin
and
poverty
and
then
there
our
boy
speak
out
do
hortense
whispered
rénine
this
is
madness
the
clasp
has
no
value
never
fear
said
rénine
he
not
going
to
accept
but
look
at
him
how
excited
he
is
exactly
what
i
wanted
ah
this
you
know
is
really
exciting
to
make
people
lose
their
heads
to
rob
them
of
all
control
over
what
they
are
thinking
and
saying
and
in
the
midst
of
this
confusion
in
the
storm
that
tosses
them
to
and
fro
to
catch
sight
of
the
tiny
spark
which
will
flash
forth
somewhere
or
other
look
at
him
look
at
the
fellow
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
a
valueless
pebble
if
not
prison
it
enough
to
turn
any
man
head
pancaldi
in
fact
was
grey
in
the
face
his
lips
were
trembling
and
a
drop
of
saliva
was
trickling
from
their
corners
it
was
easy
to
guess
the
seething
turmoil
of
his
whole
being
shaken
by
conflicting
emotions
by
the
clash
between
greed
and
fear
suddenly
he
burst
out
and
it
was
obvious
that
his
words
were
pouring
forth
at
random
without
his
knowing
in
the
least
what
he
was
saying
a
hundred
thousand
francs
two
hundred
thousand
five
hundred
thousand
a
million
a
two
fig
for
your
millions
what
the
use
of
millions
one
loses
them
they
disappear
they
go
there
only
one
thing
that
counts
luck
it
on
your
side
or
else
against
you
and
luck
has
been
on
my
side
these
last
nine
years
it
has
never
betrayed
me
and
you
expect
me
to
betray
it
why
out
of
fear
prison
my
son
bosh
no
harm
will
come
to
me
so
long
as
i
compel
luck
to
work
on
my
behalf
it
my
servant
it
my
friend
it
clings
to
the
clasp
how
how
can
i
tell
it
the
cornelian
no
doubt
there
are
magic
stones
which
hold
happiness
as
others
hold
fire
or
sulphur
or
gold
rénine
kept
his
eyes
fixed
upon
him
watching
for
the
least
word
the
least
modulation
of
the
voice
the
was
now
laughing
with
a
nervous
laugh
while
resuming
the
of
a
man
who
feels
sure
of
himself
and
he
walked
up
to
rénine
with
jerky
movements
that
revealed
an
increasing
resolution
millions
my
dear
sir
i
would
have
them
as
a
gift
the
little
bit
of
stone
which
i
possess
is
worth
much
more
than
that
and
the
proof
of
it
lies
in
all
the
pains
which
you
are
at
to
take
it
from
me
aha
months
devoted
to
looking
for
it
as
you
yourself
confess
months
in
which
you
turned
everything
while
i
who
suspected
nothing
did
not
even
defend
myself
why
should
i
the
little
thing
defended
itself
all
alone
it
does
not
want
to
be
discovered
and
it
be
it
likes
being
here
it
presides
over
a
good
honest
business
that
satisfies
it
pancaldi
luck
why
it
known
to
all
the
neighbourhood
among
all
the
dealers
i
proclaim
it
from
the
a
lucky
man
i
even
made
so
bold
as
to
take
the
god
of
luck
mercury
as
my
patron
he
too
protects
me
see
i
got
mercuries
all
over
my
shop
look
up
there
on
that
shelf
a
whole
row
of
statuettes
like
the
one
over
the
proofs
signed
by
a
great
sculptor
who
went
smash
and
sold
them
to
me
would
you
like
one
my
dear
sir
it
will
bring
you
luck
too
take
your
pick
a
present
from
pancaldi
to
make
up
to
you
for
your
defeat
does
that
suit
you
he
put
a
stool
against
the
wall
under
the
shelf
took
down
a
statuette
and
plumped
it
into
rénine
arms
and
laughing
heartily
growing
more
and
more
excited
as
his
enemy
seemed
to
yield
ground
and
to
fall
back
before
his
spirited
attack
he
explained
well
done
he
accepts
and
the
fact
that
he
accepts
shows
that
we
are
all
agreed
madame
pancaldi
do
distress
yourself
your
son
coming
back
and
nobody
going
to
prison
mlle
hortense
sir
hope
to
see
you
again
if
you
want
to
speak
to
me
at
any
time
just
give
three
thumps
on
the
ceiling
do
forget
your
present
and
may
mercury
be
kind
to
you
my
dear
prince
mlle
hortense
he
hustled
them
to
the
iron
staircase
gripped
each
of
them
by
the
arm
in
turn
and
pushed
them
up
to
the
little
door
hidden
at
the
top
of
the
stairs
and
the
strange
thing
was
that
rénine
made
no
protest
he
did
not
attempt
to
resist
he
allowed
himself
to
be
led
along
like
a
naughty
child
that
is
taken
up
to
bed
less
than
five
minutes
had
elapsed
between
the
moment
when
he
made
his
offer
to
pancaldi
and
the
moment
when
pancaldi
turned
him
out
of
the
shop
with
a
statuette
in
his
arms
the
and
of
the
flat
which
rénine
had
taken
on
the
first
floor
looked
out
upon
the
street
the
table
in
the
was
laid
for
two
forgive
me
wo
you
said
rénine
as
he
opened
the
door
of
the
for
hortense
i
thought
that
whatever
happened
i
should
most
likely
see
you
this
evening
and
that
we
might
as
well
dine
together
do
refuse
me
this
kindness
which
will
be
the
last
favour
granted
in
our
last
adventure
hortense
did
not
refuse
him
the
manner
in
which
the
battle
had
ended
was
so
different
from
everything
that
she
had
seen
hitherto
that
she
felt
disconcerted
at
any
rate
why
should
she
refuse
seeing
that
the
terms
of
the
contract
had
not
been
fulfilled
rénine
left
the
room
to
give
an
order
to
his
manservant
two
minutes
later
he
came
back
for
hortense
it
was
then
a
little
past
seven
there
were
flowers
on
the
table
and
the
statue
of
mercury
present
stood
overtopping
them
may
the
god
of
luck
preside
over
our
repast
said
rénine
he
was
full
of
animation
and
expressed
his
great
delight
at
having
her
sitting
opposite
him
yes
he
exclaimed
i
had
to
resort
to
powerful
means
and
attract
you
by
the
bait
of
the
most
fabulous
enterprises
you
must
confess
that
my
letter
was
jolly
smart
the
three
rushes
the
blue
gown
simply
irresistible
and
when
i
had
thrown
in
a
few
puzzles
of
my
own
invention
such
as
the
beads
of
the
necklace
and
the
old
woman
with
the
silver
rosary
i
knew
that
you
were
bound
to
succumb
to
the
temptation
do
be
angry
with
me
i
wanted
to
see
you
and
i
wanted
it
to
be
today
you
have
come
and
i
thank
you
he
next
told
her
how
he
had
got
on
the
track
of
the
stolen
trinket
you
hoped
did
you
in
laying
down
that
condition
that
i
should
be
able
to
fulfil
it
you
made
a
mistake
my
dear
the
test
at
least
at
the
beginning
was
easy
enough
because
it
was
based
upon
an
undoubted
fact
the
talismanic
character
attributed
to
the
clasp
i
had
only
to
hunt
about
and
see
whether
among
the
people
around
you
among
your
servants
there
was
ever
any
one
upon
whom
that
character
may
have
exercised
some
attraction
now
on
the
list
of
persons
which
i
succeeded
in
drawing
up
i
at
once
noticed
the
name
of
mlle
lucienne
as
coming
from
corsica
this
was
my
the
rest
was
a
mere
concatenation
of
events
hortense
stared
at
him
in
amazement
how
was
it
that
he
was
accepting
his
defeat
with
such
a
careless
air
and
even
talking
in
a
tone
of
triumph
whereas
really
he
had
been
soundly
beaten
by
pancaldi
and
even
made
to
look
just
a
trifle
ridiculous
she
could
not
help
letting
him
feel
this
and
the
fashion
in
which
she
did
so
betrayed
a
certain
disappointment
a
certain
humiliation
everything
is
a
concatenation
of
events
very
well
but
the
chain
is
broken
because
when
all
is
said
though
you
know
the
thief
you
did
not
succeed
in
laying
hands
upon
the
stolen
clasp
the
reproach
was
obvious
rénine
had
not
accustomed
her
to
failure
and
furthermore
she
was
irritated
to
see
how
heedlessly
he
was
accepting
a
blow
which
after
all
entailed
the
ruin
of
any
hopes
that
he
might
have
entertained
he
did
not
reply
he
had
filled
their
two
glasses
with
champagne
and
was
slowly
emptying
his
own
with
his
eyes
fixed
on
the
statuette
of
mercury
he
turned
it
about
on
its
pedestal
and
examined
it
with
the
eye
of
a
delighted
connoisseur
what
a
beautiful
thing
is
a
harmonious
line
colour
does
not
uplift
me
so
much
as
outline
proportion
symmetry
and
all
the
wonderful
properties
of
form
look
at
this
little
statue
pancaldi
right
it
the
work
of
a
great
artist
the
legs
are
both
slender
and
muscular
the
whole
figure
gives
an
impression
of
buoyancy
and
speed
it
is
very
well
done
only
one
fault
a
very
slight
one
perhaps
you
not
noticed
it
yes
i
have
said
hortense
it
struck
me
the
moment
i
saw
the
sign
outside
you
mean
do
you
a
certain
lack
of
balance
the
god
is
leaning
over
too
far
on
the
leg
that
carries
him
he
looks
as
though
he
were
going
to
pitch
forward
that
very
clever
of
you
said
rénine
the
fault
is
almost
imperceptible
and
it
needs
a
trained
eye
to
see
it
really
however
as
a
matter
of
logic
the
weight
of
the
body
ought
to
have
its
way
and
in
accordance
with
natural
laws
the
little
god
ought
to
take
a
header
after
a
pause
he
continued
i
noticed
that
flaw
on
the
first
day
how
was
it
that
i
did
not
draw
an
inference
at
once
i
was
shocked
because
the
artist
had
sinned
against
an
aesthetic
law
whereas
i
ought
to
have
been
shocked
because
he
had
overlooked
a
physical
law
as
though
art
and
nature
were
not
blended
together
and
as
though
the
laws
of
gravity
could
be
disturbed
without
some
fundamental
reason
what
do
you
mean
asked
hortense
puzzled
by
these
reflections
which
seemed
so
far
removed
from
their
secret
thoughts
what
do
you
mean
oh
nothing
he
said
i
am
only
surprised
that
i
did
understand
sooner
why
mercury
did
not
plump
forward
as
he
should
have
done
and
what
is
the
reason
the
reason
i
imagine
that
pancaldi
when
pulling
the
statuette
about
to
make
it
serve
his
purpose
must
have
disturbed
its
balance
but
that
this
balance
was
restored
by
something
which
holds
the
little
god
back
and
which
makes
up
for
his
really
too
dangerous
posture
something
you
say
yes
a
counterweight
hortense
gave
a
start
she
too
was
beginning
to
see
a
little
light
she
murmured
a
counterweight
are
you
thinking
that
it
might
be
in
the
pedestal
why
not
is
that
possible
but
if
so
how
did
pancaldi
come
to
give
you
this
statuette
he
never
gave
me
one
rénine
declared
i
took
this
one
myself
but
where
and
when
just
now
while
you
were
in
the
i
got
out
of
that
window
which
is
just
over
the
signboard
and
beside
the
niche
containing
the
little
god
and
i
exchanged
the
two
that
is
to
say
i
took
the
statue
which
was
outside
and
put
the
one
which
pancaldi
gave
me
in
its
place
but
does
that
one
lean
forward
no
no
more
than
the
others
do
on
the
shelf
in
his
shop
but
pancaldi
is
not
an
artist
a
lack
of
equilibrium
does
not
impress
him
he
will
see
nothing
wrong
and
he
will
continue
to
think
himself
favoured
by
luck
which
is
another
way
of
saying
that
luck
will
continue
to
favour
him
meanwhile
here
the
statuette
the
one
used
for
the
sign
am
i
to
break
the
pedestal
and
take
your
clasp
out
of
the
leaden
sheath
soldered
to
the
back
of
the
pedestal
which
keeps
mercury
steady
no
no
there
no
need
for
that
hortense
hurriedly
murmured
rénine
intuition
his
subtlety
the
skill
with
which
he
had
managed
the
whole
business
to
her
for
the
moment
all
these
things
remained
in
the
background
but
she
suddenly
remembered
that
the
eighth
adventure
was
completed
that
rénine
had
surmounted
every
obstacle
that
the
test
had
turned
to
his
advantage
and
that
the
extreme
limit
of
time
fixed
for
the
last
of
the
adventures
was
not
yet
reached
he
had
the
cruelty
to
call
attention
to
the
fact
a
quarter
to
eight
he
said
an
oppressive
silence
fell
between
them
both
felt
its
discomfort
to
such
a
degree
that
they
hesitated
to
make
the
least
movement
in
order
to
break
it
rénine
jested
that
worthy
pancaldi
how
good
it
was
of
him
to
tell
me
what
i
wished
to
know
i
knew
however
that
by
exasperating
him
i
should
end
by
picking
up
the
missing
clue
in
what
he
said
it
was
just
as
though
one
were
to
hand
some
one
a
flint
and
steel
and
suggest
to
him
that
he
was
to
use
it
in
the
end
the
spark
is
obtained
in
my
case
what
produced
the
spark
was
the
unconscious
but
inevitable
comparison
which
he
drew
between
the
cornelian
clasp
the
element
of
luck
and
mercury
the
god
of
luck
that
was
enough
i
understood
that
this
association
of
ideas
arose
from
his
having
actually
associated
the
two
factors
of
luck
by
embodying
one
in
the
other
or
to
speak
more
plainly
by
hiding
the
trinket
in
the
statuette
and
i
at
once
remembered
the
mercury
outside
the
door
and
its
defective
poise
rénine
suddenly
interrupted
himself
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
his
remarks
were
falling
on
deaf
ears
hortense
had
put
her
hand
to
her
forehead
and
thus
veiling
her
eyes
sat
motionless
and
remote
she
was
indeed
not
listening
the
end
of
this
particular
adventure
and
the
manner
in
which
rénine
had
acted
on
this
occasion
no
longer
interested
her
what
she
was
thinking
of
was
the
complex
series
of
adventures
amid
which
she
had
been
living
for
the
past
three
months
and
the
wonderful
behaviour
of
the
man
who
had
offered
her
his
devotion
she
saw
as
in
a
magic
picture
the
fabulous
deeds
performed
by
him
all
the
good
that
he
had
done
the
lives
saved
the
sorrows
assuaged
the
order
restored
wherever
his
masterly
will
had
been
brought
to
bear
nothing
was
impossible
to
him
what
he
undertook
to
do
he
did
every
aim
that
he
set
before
him
was
attained
in
advance
and
all
this
without
excessive
effort
with
the
calmness
of
one
who
knows
his
own
strength
and
knows
that
nothing
can
resist
it
then
what
could
she
do
against
him
why
should
she
defend
herself
and
how
if
he
demanded
that
she
should
yield
would
he
not
know
how
to
make
her
do
so
and
would
this
last
adventure
be
any
more
difficult
for
him
than
the
others
supposing
that
she
ran
away
did
the
wide
world
contain
a
retreat
in
which
she
would
be
safe
from
his
pursuit
from
the
first
moment
of
their
first
meeting
the
end
was
certain
since
rénine
had
decreed
that
it
should
be
so
however
she
still
cast
about
for
weapons
for
protection
of
some
sort
and
she
said
to
herself
that
though
he
had
fulfilled
the
eight
conditions
and
restored
the
cornelian
clasp
to
her
before
the
eighth
hour
had
struck
she
was
nevertheless
protected
by
the
fact
that
this
eighth
hour
was
to
strike
on
the
clock
of
the
château
de
halingre
and
not
elsewhere
it
was
a
formal
compact
rénine
had
said
that
day
gazing
on
the
lips
which
he
longed
to
kiss
the
old
brass
pendulum
will
start
swinging
again
and
when
on
the
fixed
date
the
clock
once
more
strikes
eight
then
she
looked
up
he
was
not
moving
either
but
sat
solemnly
patiently
waiting
she
was
on
the
point
of
saying
she
was
even
preparing
her
words
you
know
our
agreement
says
it
must
be
the
halingre
clock
all
the
other
conditions
have
been
fulfilled
but
not
this
one
so
i
am
free
am
i
not
i
am
entitled
not
to
keep
my
promise
which
moreover
i
never
made
but
which
in
any
case
falls
to
the
ground
and
i
am
perfectly
free
released
from
any
scruple
of
conscience
she
had
not
time
to
speak
at
that
precise
moment
there
was
a
click
behind
her
like
that
of
a
clock
about
to
strike
a
first
stroke
sounded
then
a
second
then
a
third
hortense
moaned
she
had
recognized
the
very
sound
of
the
old
clock
the
halingre
clock
which
three
months
ago
by
breaking
in
a
supernatural
manner
the
silence
of
the
deserted
château
had
set
both
of
them
on
the
road
of
the
eight
adventures
she
counted
the
strokes
the
clock
struck
eight
ah
she
murmured
half
swooning
and
hiding
her
face
in
her
hands
the
clock
the
clock
is
here
the
one
from
over
there
i
recognize
its
voice
she
said
no
more
she
felt
that
rénine
had
his
eyes
fixed
upon
her
and
this
sapped
all
her
energies
besides
had
she
been
able
to
recover
them
she
would
have
been
no
better
off
nor
sought
to
offer
him
the
least
resistance
for
the
reason
that
she
did
not
wish
to
resist
all
the
adventures
were
over
but
one
remained
to
be
undertaken
the
anticipation
of
which
wiped
out
the
memory
of
all
the
rest
it
was
the
adventure
of
love
the
most
delightful
the
most
bewildering
the
most
adorable
of
all
adventures
she
accepted
fate
decree
rejoicing
in
all
that
might
come
because
she
was
in
love
she
smiled
in
spite
of
herself
as
she
reflected
that
happiness
was
again
to
enter
her
life
at
the
very
moment
when
her
was
bringing
her
the
cornelian
clasp
the
clock
struck
the
hour
for
the
second
time
hortense
raised
her
eyes
to
rénine
she
struggled
a
few
seconds
longer
but
she
was
like
a
charmed
bird
incapable
of
any
movement
of
revolt
and
at
the
eighth
stroke
she
fell
upon
his
breast
and
offered
him
her
lips
the
end
