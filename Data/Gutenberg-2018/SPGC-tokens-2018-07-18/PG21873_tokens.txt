brion
entered
the
temple
and
stood
as
if
rooted
to
the
ground
there
was
a
horror
in
this
place
it
clung
to
everything
muffled
and
hooded
men
stood
silent
and
unmoving
about
the
room
their
attention
rigidly
focused
on
a
figure
in
the
center
brion
wondered
how
he
knew
they
were
men
only
their
eyes
showed
eyes
completely
empty
of
expression
yet
somehow
reminding
him
of
a
bird
of
prey
then
suddenly
the
figure
in
the
center
moved
it
was
a
weird
crazily
menacing
action
and
in
an
instant
brion
knew
he
had
found

enemy

the
evil

stephen
crane
sweat
covered
brion
body
trickling
into
the
tight
loincloth
that
was
the
only
garment
he
wore
the
light
fencing
foil
in
his
hand
felt
as
heavy
as
a
bar
of
lead
to
his
exhausted
muscles
worn
out
by
a
month
of
continual
exercise
these
things
were
of
no
importance
the
cut
on
his
chest
still
dripping
blood
the
ache
of
his
overstrained
eyes
even
the
soaring
arena
around
him
with
the
thousands
of
spectators
were
trivialities
not
worth
thinking
about
there
was
only
one
thing
in
his
universe
the
length
of
shining
steel
that
hovered
before
him
engaging
his
own
weapon
he
felt
the
quiver
and
scrape
of
its
life
knew
when
it
moved
and
moved
himself
to
counteract
it
and
when
he
attacked
it
was
always
there
to
beat
him
aside
a
sudden
motion
he
reacted
but
his
blade
just
met
air
his
instant
of
panic
was
followed
by
a
small
sharp
blow
high
on
his
chest
a
voice
bellowed
the
word
to
a
million
waiting
loudspeakers
and
the
applause
of
the
audience
echoed
back
in
a
wave
of
sound
one
minute
a
voice
said
and
the
time
buzzer
sounded
brion
had
carefully
conditioned
the
reflex
in
himself
a
minute
is
not
a
very
large
measure
of
time
and
his
body
needed
every
fraction
of
it
the
buzzer
whirr
triggered
his
muscles
into
complete
relaxation
only
his
heart
and
lungs
worked
on
at
a
strong
measured
rate
his
eyes
closed
and
he
was
only
distantly
aware
of
his
handlers
catching
him
as
he
fell
carrying
him
to
his
bench
while
they
massaged
his
limp
body
and
cleansed
the
wound
all
of
his
attention
was
turned
inward
he
was
in
reverie
sliding
along
the
borders
of
consciousness
the
nagging
memory
of
the
previous
night
loomed
up
then
and
he
turned
it
over
and
over
in
his
mind
examining
it
from
all
sides
it
was
the
very
unexpectedness
of
the
event
that
had
been
so
unusual
the
contestants
in
the
twenties
needed
undisturbed
rest
therefore
nights
in
the
dormitories
were
as
quiet
as
death
during
the
first
few
days
of
course
the
rule
was
observed
too
closely
the
men
themselves
were
too
keyed
up
and
excited
to
rest
easily
but
as
soon
as
the
scores
began
to
mount
and
eliminations
cut
into
their
ranks
there
was
complete
silence
after
dark
particularly
so
on
this
last
night
when
only
two
of
the
little
cubicles
were
occupied
the
thousands
of
others
standing
with
dark
empty
doors
angry
words
had
dragged
brion
from
a
deep
and
exhausted
sleep
the
words
were
whispered
but
clear
two
voices
just
outside
the
thin
metal
of
his
door
someone
spoke
his
name
brion
brandd
of
course
not
whoever
said
you
could
was
making
a
big
mistake
and
there
is
going
to
be
trouble
do
talk
like
an
idiot
the
other
voice
snapped
with
a
harsh
urgency
clearly
used
to
command
i
here
because
the
matter
is
of
utmost
importance
and
brandd
is
the
one
i
must
see
now
stand
aside
the
twenties
i
do
give
a
damn
about
your
games
hearty
cheers
and
physical
exercises
this
is
or
i
would
be
here
the
other
did
speak
he
was
surely
one
of
the
officials
and
brion
could
sense
his
outraged
anger
he
must
have
drawn
his
gun
because
the
intruder
said
quickly
put
that
away
you
being
a
fool
out
was
the
single
snarled
word
of
the
response
there
was
silence
then
and
still
wondering
brion
was
once
more
asleep
ten
seconds
the
voice
chopped
away
brion
memories
and
he
let
awareness
seep
back
into
his
body
he
was
unhappily
conscious
of
his
total
exhaustion
the
month
of
continuous
mental
and
physical
combat
had
taken
its
toll
it
would
be
hard
to
stay
on
his
feet
much
less
summon
the
strength
and
skill
to
fight
and
win
a
touch
how
do
we
stand
he
asked
the
handler
who
was
kneading
his
aching
muscles
all
you
need
is
a
touch
to
win
that
all
he
needs
too
brion
grunted
opening
his
eyes
to
look
at
the
wiry
length
of
the
man
at
the
other
end
of
the
long
mat
no
one
who
had
reached
the
finals
in
the
twenties
could
possibly
be
a
weak
opponent
but
this
one
irolg
was
the
pick
of
the
lot
a
mountain
of
a
man
with
an
apparently
inexhaustible
store
of
energy
that
was
really
all
that
counted
now
there
could
be
little
art
in
this
last
and
final
round
of
fencing
just
thrust
and
parry
and
victory
to
the
stronger
brion
closed
his
eyes
again
and
knew
the
moment
he
had
been
hoping
to
avoid
had
arrived
every
man
who
entered
the
twenties
had
his
own
training
tricks
brion
had
a
few
individual
ones
that
had
helped
him
so
far
he
was
a
moderately
strong
chess
player
but
he
had
moved
to
quick
victory
in
the
chess
rounds
by
playing
incredibly
unorthodox
games
this
was
no
accident
but
the
result
of
years
of
work
he
had
a
standing
order
with
agents
for
archaic
chess
books
the
older
the
better
he
had
memorized
thousands
of
these
ancient
games
and
openings
this
was
allowed
anything
was
allowed
that
did
involve
drugs
or
machines
was
an
accepted
tool
it
had
taken
brion
over
two
years
to
find
a
way
to
tap
the
sources
of
hysterical
strength
common
as
the
phenomenon
seemed
to
be
in
the
textbooks
it
proved
impossible
to
duplicate
there
appeared
to
be
an
immediate
association
with
the
as
if
the
two
were
inextricably
linked
into
one
berserkers
and
juramentados
continue
to
fight
and
kill
though
carved
by
scores
of
mortal
wounds
men
with
bullets
in
the
heart
or
brain
fight
on
though
already
clinically
dead
death
seemed
an
inescapable
part
of
this
kind
of
strength
but
there
was
another
type
that
could
easily
be
brought
about
in
any
deep
trance
hypnotic
rigidity
the
strength
that
enables
someone
in
a
trance
to
hold
his
body
stiff
and
unsupported
except
at
two
points
the
head
and
heels
this
is
physically
impossible
when
conscious
working
with
this
as
a
clue
brion
had
developed
a
technique
that
allowed
him
to
tap
this
reservoir
of
unknown
strength
the
source
of
second
wind
the
survival
strength
that
made
the
difference
between
life
and
death
it
could
also
kill
exhaust
the
body
beyond
hope
of
recovery
particularly
when
in
a
weakened
condition
as
his
was
now
but
that
was
important
others
had
died
before
during
the
twenties
and
death
during
the
last
round
was
in
some
ways
easier
than
defeat
breathing
deeply
brion
softly
spoke
the
phrases
that
triggered
the
process
fatigue
fell
softly
from
him
as
did
all
sensations
of
heat
cold
and
pain
he
could
feel
with
acute
sensitivity
hear
and
see
clearly
when
he
opened
his
eyes
with
each
passing
second
the
power
drew
at
the
basic
reserves
of
life
draining
it
from
his
body
when
the
buzzer
sounded
he
pulled
his
foil
from
his
startled
grasp
and
ran
forward
irolg
had
barely
time
to
grab
up
his
own
weapon
and
parry
brion
first
thrust
the
force
of
his
rush
was
so
great
that
the
guards
on
their
weapons
locked
and
their
bodies
crashed
together
irolg
looked
amazed
at
the
sudden
fury
of
the
attack
then
smiled
he
thought
it
was
a
last
burst
of
energy
he
knew
how
close
they
both
were
to
exhaustion
this
must
be
the
end
for
brion
they
disengaged
and
irolg
put
up
a
solid
defense
he
did
attempt
to
attack
just
let
brion
wear
himself
out
against
the
firm
shield
of
his
defense
brion
saw
something
close
to
panic
on
his
opponent
face
when
the
man
finally
recognized
his
error
brion
was
tiring
if
anything
he
was
pressing
the
attack
a
wave
of
despair
rolled
out
from
irolg
brion
sensed
it
and
knew
the
fifth
point
was
his
thrust
thrust
and
each
time
the
parrying
sword
a
little
slower
to
return
then
the
powerful
twist
that
thrust
it
aside
in
and
under
the
guard
the
slap
of
the
button
on
flesh
and
the
arc
of
steel
that
reached
out
and
ended
on
irolg
chest
over
his
heart
waves
of
sound
cheering
and
screaming
lapped
against
private
world
but
he
was
only
remotely
aware
of
their
existence
irolg
dropped
his
foil
and
tried
to
shake
brion
hand
but
his
legs
suddenly
gave
way
brion
had
an
arm
around
him
holding
him
up
walking
towards
the
rushing
handlers
then
irolg
was
gone
and
he
waved
off
his
own
men
walking
slowly
by
himself
except
that
something
was
wrong
and
it
was
like
walking
through
warm
glue
walking
on
his
knees
no
not
walking
falling
at
last
he
was
able
to
let
go
and
fall
ii
ihjel
gave
the
doctors
exactly
one
day
before
he
went
to
the
hospital
brion
was
dead
though
there
had
been
some
doubt
about
that
the
night
before
now
a
full
day
later
he
was
on
the
mend
and
that
was
all
ihjel
wanted
to
know
he
bullied
and
his
way
to
the
new
winner
room
meeting
his
first
stiff
resistance
at
the
door
you
out
of
order
winner
ihjel
the
doctor
said
and
if
you
keep
on
forcing
yourself
in
here
where
you
are
not
wanted
rank
or
no
rank
i
shall
be
obliged
to
break
your
head
ihjel
had
just
begun
to
tell
him
in
some
detail
just
how
slim
his
chances
were
of
accomplishing
that
when
brion
interrupted
them
both
he
recognized
the
newcomer
voice
from
the
final
night
in
the
barracks
let
him
in
caulry
he
said
i
want
to
meet
a
man
who
thinks
there
is
something
more
important
than
the
twenties
while
the
doctor
stood
undecided
ihjel
moved
quickly
around
him
and
closed
the
door
in
his
flushed
face
he
looked
down
at
the
winner
in
the
bed
there
was
a
drip
plugged
into
each
one
of
brion
arms
his
eyes
peered
from
sooty
hollows
the
eyeballs
were
a
network
of
red
veins
the
silent
battle
he
fought
against
death
had
left
its
mark
his
square
jutting
jaw
now
seemed
all
bone
as
did
his
long
nose
and
high
cheekbones
they
were
prominent
landmarks
rising
from
the
limp
greyness
of
his
skin
only
the
erect
bristle
of
his
hair
was
unchanged
he
had
the
appearance
of
having
suffered
a
long
and
wasting
illness
you
look
like
sin
ihjel
said
but
congratulations
on
your
victory
you
do
look
so
very
good
yourself
for
a
winner
brion
snapped
back
his
exhaustion
and
sudden
peevish
anger
at
this
man
let
the
insulting
words
slip
out
ihjel
ignored
them
but
it
was
true
winner
ihjel
looked
very
little
like
a
winner
or
even
an
anvharian
he
had
the
height
and
the
frame
all
right
but
it
was
draped
in
billows
of
fat
rounded
soft
tissue
that
hung
loosely
from
his
limbs
and
made
little
limp
rolls
on
his
neck
and
under
his
eyes
there
were
no
fat
men
on
anvhar
and
it
was
incredible
that
a
man
so
gross
could
ever
have
been
a
winner
if
there
was
muscle
under
the
fat
it
could
be
seen
only
his
eyes
appeared
to
still
hold
the
strength
that
had
once
bested
every
man
on
the
planet
to
win
the
annual
games
brion
turned
away
from
their
burning
stare
sorry
now
he
had
insulted
the
man
without
good
reason
he
was
too
sick
though
to
bother
about
apologizing
ihjel
did
care
either
brion
looked
at
him
again
and
felt
the
impression
of
things
so
important
that
he
himself
his
insults
even
the
twenties
were
of
no
more
interest
than
dust
motes
in
the
air
it
was
only
a
fantasy
of
a
sick
mind
brion
knew
and
he
tried
to
shake
the
feeling
off
the
two
men
stared
at
each
other
sharing
a
common
emotion
the
door
opened
soundlessly
behind
ihjel
and
he
wheeled
about
moving
as
only
an
athlete
of
anvhar
can
move
caulry
was
halfway
through
the
door
off
balance
two
men
in
uniform
came
close
behind
him
ihjel
body
pushed
against
them
his
speed
and
the
mountainous
mass
of
his
flesh
sending
them
back
in
a
tangle
of
arms
and
legs
he
slammed
the
door
and
locked
it
in
their
faces
i
have
to
talk
to
you
he
said
turning
back
to
brion
privately
he
added
bending
over
and
ripping
out
the
communicator
with
a
sweep
of
one
hand
get
out
brion
told
him
if
i
were
able
well
you
not
so
you
just
going
to
have
to
lie
there
and
listen
i
imagine
we
have
about
five
minutes
before
they
decide
to
break
the
door
down
and
i
do
want
to
waste
any
more
of
that
will
you
come
with
me
offworld
there
a
job
that
must
be
done
it
my
job
but
i
going
to
need
help
you
the
only
one
who
can
give
me
that
help
now
refuse
he
added
as
brion
started
to
answer
of
course
i
refuse
brion
said
feeling
a
little
foolish
and
slightly
angry
as
if
the
other
man
had
put
the
words
into
his
mouth
anvhar
is
my
planet
why
should
i
leave
my
life
is
here
and
so
is
my
work
i
also
might
add
that
i
have
just
won
the
twenties
i
have
a
responsibility
to
remain
nonsense
i
a
winner
and
i
left
what
you
really
mean
is
you
would
like
to
enjoy
a
little
of
the
you
have
worked
so
hard
to
get
off
anvhar
no
one
even
knows
what
a
winner
is
much
less
respects
one
you
will
have
to
face
a
big
universe
out
there
and
i
do
blame
you
for
being
a
little
frightened
someone
was
hammering
loudly
on
the
door
i
have
the
strength
to
get
angry
brion
said
hoarsely
and
i
ca
bring
myself
to
admire
your
ideas
when
they
permit
you
to
insult
a
man
too
ill
to
defend
himself
i
apologize
ihjel
said
with
no
hint
of
apology
or
sympathy
in
his
voice
but
there
are
more
desperate
issues
involved
than
your
hurt
feelings
we
do
have
much
time
now
so
i
want
to
impress
you
with
an
idea
an
idea
that
will
convince
me
to
go
offplanet
with
you
expecting
a
lot
no
this
idea
wo
convince
you
but
thinking
about
it
will
if
you
really
it
you
will
find
a
lot
of
your
illusions
shattered
like
everyone
else
on
anvhar
you
a
scientific
humanist
with
your
faith
firmly
planted
in
the
twenties
you
accept
both
of
these
noble
institutions
without
an
instant
thought
all
of
you
have
a
single
thought
for
the
past
for
the
untold
billions
who
led
the
bad
life
as
mankind
slowly
built
up
the
good
life
for
you
to
lead
do
you
ever
think
of
all
the
people
who
suffered
and
died
in
misery
and
superstition
while
civilization
was
clicking
forward
one
more
slow
notch
of
course
i
do
think
about
them
brion
retorted
why
should
i
i
ca
change
the
past
but
you
can
change
the
future
ihjel
said
you
owe
something
to
the
suffering
ancestors
who
got
you
where
you
are
today
if
scientific
humanism
means
anything
more
than
just
words
to
you
you
must
possess
a
sense
of
responsibility
do
you
want
to
try
and
pay
off
a
bit
of
this
debt
by
helping
others
who
are
just
as
backward
and
today
as
troglodyte
ever
was
the
hammering
on
the
door
was
louder
this
and
the
buzzing
in
brion
ear
made
thinking
difficult
abstractly
i
of
course
agree
with
you
he
said
haltingly
but
you
know
there
is
nothing
i
can
do
personally
without
being
emotionally
involved
a
logical
decision
is
valueless
for
action
without
personal
meaning
then
we
have
reached
the
crux
of
the
matter
ihjel
said
gently
his
back
was
braced
against
the
door
absorbing
the
thudding
blows
of
some
heavy
object
on
the
outside
they
knocking
so
i
must
be
going
soon
i
have
no
time
for
details
but
i
can
assure
you
upon
my
word
of
honor
as
a
winner
that
there
is
something
you
can
do
only
you
if
you
help
me
we
might
save
seven
million
human
lives
that
is
a
fact
the
lock
burst
and
the
door
started
to
open
ihjel
shouldered
it
back
into
the
frame
for
a
final
instant
here
is
the
idea
i
want
you
to
consider
why
is
it
that
the
people
of
anvhar
in
a
galaxy
filled
with
warring
backward
planets
should
be
the
only
ones
who
base
their
entire
existence
on
a
complicated
series
of
games
iii
this
time
there
was
no
way
to
hold
the
door
ihjel
did
try
he
stepped
aside
and
two
men
stumbled
into
the
room
he
walked
out
behind
their
backs
without
saying
a
word
what
happened
what
did
he
do
the
doctor
asked
rushing
in
through
the
ruined
door
he
swept
a
glance
over
the
continuous
recording
dials
at
the
foot
of
brion
bed
respiration
temperature
heart
blood
pressure
all
were
normal
the
patient
lay
quietly
and
did
answer
him
for
the
rest
of
that
day
brion
had
much
to
think
about
it
was
difficult
the
fatigue
mixed
with
the
tranquilizers
and
other
drugs
had
softened
his
contact
with
reality
his
thoughts
kept
echoing
back
and
forth
in
his
mind
unable
to
escape
what
had
ihjel
meant
what
was
that
nonsense
about
anvhar
anvhar
was
that
way
because
well
it
just
was
it
had
come
about
naturally
or
had
it
the
planet
had
a
very
simple
history
from
the
very
beginning
there
had
never
been
anything
of
real
commercial
interest
on
anvhar
well
off
the
interstellar
trade
routes
there
were
no
minerals
worth
digging
and
transporting
the
immense
distances
to
the
nearest
inhabited
worlds
hunting
the
winter
beasts
for
their
pelts
was
a
profitable
but
very
minor
enterprise
never
sufficient
for
mass
markets
therefore
no
organized
attempt
had
ever
been
made
to
colonize
the
planet
in
the
end
it
had
been
settled
completely
by
chance
a
number
of
offplanet
scientific
groups
had
established
observation
and
research
stations
finding
unlimited
data
to
observe
and
record
during
anvhar
unusual
yearly
cycle
the
observations
encouraged
the
scientific
workers
to
bring
their
families
and
slowly
but
steadily
small
settlements
grew
up
many
of
the
fur
hunters
settled
there
as
well
adding
to
the
small
population
this
had
been
the
beginning
few
records
existed
of
those
early
days
and
the
first
six
centuries
of
anvharian
history
were
more
speculation
than
fact
the
breakdown
occurred
about
that
time
and
in
the
disruption
anvhar
had
to
fight
its
own
internal
battle
when
the
earth
empire
collapsed
it
was
the
end
of
more
than
an
era
many
of
the
observation
stations
found
themselves
representing
institutions
that
no
longer
existed
the
professional
hunters
no
longer
had
markets
for
their
furs
since
anvhar
possessed
no
interstellar
ships
of
its
own
there
had
been
no
real
physical
hardship
involved
in
the
breakdown
as
it
affected
anvhar
since
the
planet
was
completely
once
they
had
made
the
mental
adjustment
to
the
fact
that
they
were
now
a
sovereign
world
not
a
collection
of
casual
visitors
with
various
loyalties
life
continued
unchanged
not
easy
living
on
anvhar
is
never
easy
but
at
least
without
difference
on
the
surface
the
thoughts
and
attitudes
of
the
people
were
however
going
through
a
great
transformation
many
attempts
were
made
to
develop
some
form
of
stable
society
and
social
relationship
again
little
record
exists
of
these
early
trials
other
than
the
fact
of
their
culmination
in
the
twenties
to
understand
the
twenties
you
have
to
understand
the
unusual
orbit
that
anvhar
tracks
around
its
sun
ophiuchi
there
are
other
planets
in
this
system
all
of
them
more
or
less
conforming
to
the
plane
of
the
ecliptic
anvhar
is
obviously
a
rogue
perhaps
a
captured
planet
of
another
sun
for
the
greatest
part
of
its
year
it
arcs
far
out
from
its
primary
in
a
sweeping
cometary
orbit
when
it
returns
there
is
a
brief
hot
summer
of
approximately
eighty
days
before
the
long
winter
sets
in
once
more
this
severe
difference
in
seasonal
change
has
caused
profound
adaptations
in
the
native
life
forms
during
the
winter
most
of
the
animals
hibernate
the
vegetable
life
lying
dormant
as
spores
or
seeds
some
of
the
herbivores
stay
active
in
the
tropics
preyed
upon
by
carnivores
though
unbelievably
cold
the
winter
is
a
season
of
peace
in
comparison
to
the
summer
for
summer
is
a
time
of
mad
growth
plants
burst
into
life
with
a
strength
that
cracks
rocks
growing
fast
enough
for
the
motion
to
be
seen
the
snowfields
melt
into
mud
and
within
days
a
jungle
stretches
high
into
the
air
everything
grows
swells
proliferates
plants
climb
on
top
of
plants
fighting
for
the
of
the
sun
everything
is
eat
and
be
eaten
grow
and
thrive
in
that
short
season
because
when
the
first
snow
of
winter
falls
again
ninety
per
cent
of
the
year
must
pass
until
the
next
coming
of
warmth
mankind
has
had
to
adapt
to
the
anvharian
cycle
in
order
to
stay
alive
food
must
be
gathered
and
stored
enough
to
last
out
the
long
winter
generation
after
generation
had
adapted
until
they
look
on
the
mad
seasonal
imbalance
as
something
quite
ordinary
the
first
thaw
of
the
almost
nonexistent
spring
triggers
a
metabolic
change
in
the
humans
layers
of
subcutaneous
fat
vanish
and
sweat
glands
come
to
life
other
changes
are
more
subtle
than
the
temperature
adjustment
but
equally
important
the
sleep
center
of
the
brain
is
depressed
short
naps
or
a
night
rest
every
third
or
fourth
day
becomes
enough
life
takes
on
a
hectic
and
hysterical
quality
that
is
perfectly
suited
to
the
environment
by
the
time
of
the
first
frost
crops
have
been
raised
and
harvested
sides
of
meat
either
preserved
or
frozen
in
mammoth
lockers
with
this
supreme
talent
of
adaptability
mankind
has
become
part
of
the
ecology
and
guaranteed
his
own
survival
during
the
long
winter
physical
survival
has
been
guaranteed
but
what
about
mental
survival
primitive
earth
eskimos
can
fall
into
a
long
doze
of
hibernation
civilized
men
might
be
able
to
do
this
but
only
for
the
few
cold
months
of
terrestrial
midwinter
it
would
be
impossible
to
do
during
a
winter
that
is
longer
than
an
earth
year
with
all
the
physical
needs
taken
care
of
boredom
became
the
enemy
of
any
anvharian
who
was
not
a
hunter
and
even
the
hunters
could
not
stay
out
on
solitary
trek
all
winter
drink
was
one
answer
and
violence
another
alcoholism
and
murder
were
the
twin
terrors
of
the
cold
season
after
the
breakdown
it
was
the
twenties
that
ended
all
that
when
they
became
a
part
of
normal
life
the
summer
was
considered
just
an
interlude
between
games
the
twenties
were
more
than
just
a
contest
they
became
a
way
of
life
that
satisfied
all
the
physical
competitive
and
intellectual
needs
of
this
unusual
planet
they
were
a
decathlon
rather
a
double
decathlon
raised
to
its
highest
power
where
contests
in
chess
and
poetry
composition
held
equal
place
with
those
in
and
archery
each
year
there
were
two
contests
held
one
for
men
and
one
for
women
this
was
not
an
attempt
at
sexual
discrimination
but
a
logical
facing
of
facts
inherent
differences
prevented
fair
contests
for
example
it
is
impossible
for
a
woman
to
win
a
large
chess
tournament
and
this
fact
was
recognized
anyone
could
enter
for
any
number
of
years
there
were
no
scoring
handicaps
when
the
best
man
won
he
was
really
the
best
man
a
complicated
series
of
playoffs
and
eliminations
kept
contestants
and
observers
busy
for
half
the
winter
they
were
only
preliminary
to
the
final
encounter
that
lasted
a
month
and
picked
a
single
winner
that
was
the
title
he
was
awarded
winner
the
man
and
woman
who
had
bested
every
other
contestant
on
the
entire
planet
and
who
would
remain
unchallenged
until
the
following
year
winner
it
was
a
title
to
take
pride
in
brion
stirred
weakly
on
his
bed
and
managed
to
turn
so
he
could
look
out
of
the
window
winner
of
anvhar
his
name
was
already
slated
for
the
history
books
one
of
the
handful
of
planetary
heroes
school
children
would
be
studying
now
just
as
he
had
read
of
the
winners
of
the
past
weaving
daydreams
and
imaginary
adventures
around
brion
victories
hoping
and
fighting
to
equal
them
someday
to
be
a
winner
was
the
greatest
honor
in
the
universe
outside
the
afternoon
sun
shimmered
weakly
in
a
dark
sky
the
endless
icefields
soaked
up
the
dim
light
reflecting
it
back
as
a
colder
and
harsher
illumination
a
single
figure
on
skis
cut
a
line
across
the
empty
plain
nothing
else
moved
the
depression
of
the
ultimate
fatigue
fell
on
brion
and
everything
changed
as
if
he
looked
in
a
mirror
at
a
previously
hidden
side
he
saw
suddenly
with
terrible
clarity
that
to
be
a
winner
was
to
be
absolutely
nothing
like
being
the
best
flea
among
all
the
fleas
on
a
single
dog
what
was
anvhar
after
all
an
planet
inhabited
by
a
few
million
human
fleas
unknown
and
unconsidered
by
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
there
was
nothing
here
worth
fighting
for
the
wars
after
the
breakdown
had
left
them
untouched
the
anvharians
had
always
taken
pride
in
this
as
if
being
so
unimportant
that
no
one
else
even
wanted
to
come
near
you
could
possibly
be
a
source
of
pride
all
the
other
worlds
of
man
grew
fought
won
lost
changed
only
on
anvhar
did
life
repeat
its
sameness
endlessly
like
a
loop
of
tape
in
a
player
brion
eyes
were
moist
he
blinked
realization
of
this
incredible
fact
wiped
the
maudlin
pity
from
his
mind
and
replaced
it
with
fear
had
his
mind
snapped
in
the
strain
of
the
last
match
these
thoughts
were
his
had
made
him
a
winner
why
was
he
feeling
it
now
anvhar
was
his
universe
how
could
he
even
imagine
it
as
a
planet
at
the
outer
limb
of
creation
what
had
come
over
him
and
induced
this
inverse
thinking
as
he
thought
the
question
the
answer
appeared
at
the
same
instant
winner
ihjel
the
fat
man
with
the
strange
pronouncements
and
probing
questions
had
he
cast
a
spell
like
some
sorcerer
or
the
devil
in
no
that
was
pure
nonsense
but
he
had
done
something
perhaps
planted
a
suggestion
when
brion
resistance
was
low
or
used
subliminal
vocalization
like
the
villain
in
brion
could
find
no
adequate
reason
on
which
to
base
his
suspicions
but
he
knew
with
sure
positiveness
that
ihjel
was
responsible
he
whistled
at
the
next
to
his
pillow
and
the
repaired
communicator
came
to
life
the
duty
nurse
appeared
in
the
small
screen
the
man
who
was
here
today
brion
said
winner
ihjel
do
you
know
where
he
is
i
must
contact
him
for
some
reason
this
flustered
her
professional
calm
the
nurse
started
to
answer
excused
herself
and
blanked
the
screen
when
it
lit
again
a
man
in
guard
uniform
had
taken
her
place
you
made
an
inquiry
the
guard
said
about
winner
ihjel
we
are
holding
him
here
in
the
hospital
following
the
disgraceful
way
in
which
he
broke
into
your
room
i
have
no
charges
to
make
will
you
ask
him
to
come
and
see
me
at
once
the
guard
controlled
his
shock
i
sorry
winner
i
do
see
how
we
can
caulry
left
specific
orders
that
you
were
not
to
be
the
doctor
has
no
control
over
my
personal
life
brion
interrupted
i
not
infectious
nor
ill
with
anything
more
than
extreme
fatigue
i
want
to
see
that
man
at
once
the
guard
took
a
deep
breath
and
made
a
quick
decision
he
is
on
the
way
up
now
he
said
and
rung
off
what
did
you
do
to
me
brion
asked
as
soon
as
ihjel
had
entered
and
they
were
alone
you
wo
deny
that
you
have
put
alien
thoughts
in
my
head
no
i
wo
deny
it
because
the
whole
point
of
my
being
here
is
to
get
those
thoughts
across
to
you
tell
me
how
you
did
it
brion
insisted
i
must
know
i
tell
you
but
there
are
many
things
you
should
understand
first
before
you
decide
to
leave
anvhar
you
must
not
only
hear
them
you
will
have
to
believe
them
the
primary
thing
the
clue
to
the
rest
is
the
true
nature
of
your
life
here
how
do
you
think
the
twenties
originated
before
he
answered
brion
carefully
took
a
double
dose
of
the
mild
stimulant
he
was
allowed
i
do
think
he
said
i
know
a
matter
of
historical
record
the
founder
of
the
games
was
giroldi
the
first
contest
was
held
in
the
twenties
have
been
held
every
year
since
then
they
were
strictly
local
affairs
in
the
beginning
but
were
soon
well
established
on
a
scale
true
enough
ihjel
said
but
you
describing
happened
i
asked
you
the
twenties
originated
how
could
any
single
man
take
a
barbarian
planet
lightly
inhabited
by
hunters
and
alcoholic
farmers
and
turn
it
into
a
social
machine
built
around
the
artificial
structure
of
the
twenties
it
just
could
be
done
but
it
done
brion
insisted
you
ca
deny
that
and
there
is
nothing
artificial
about
the
twenties
they
are
a
logical
way
to
live
a
life
on
a
planet
like
this
ihjel
laughed
a
short
ironic
bark
very
logical
he
said
but
how
often
does
logic
have
anything
to
do
with
the
organization
of
social
groups
and
governments
you
not
thinking
put
yourself
in
founder
giroldi
place
imagine
that
you
have
glimpsed
the
great
idea
of
the
twenties
and
you
want
to
convince
others
so
you
walk
up
to
the
nearest
brawling
superstitious
hunter
and
explain
clearly
how
a
program
of
his
favorite
sports
things
like
poetry
archery
and
chess
can
make
his
life
that
much
more
interesting
and
virtuous
you
do
that
but
keep
your
eyes
open
at
the
same
time
and
be
ready
for
a
fast
draw
even
brion
had
to
smile
at
the
absurdity
of
the
suggestion
of
course
it
could
happen
that
way
yet
since
it
had
happened
there
must
be
a
simple
explanation
we
can
beat
this
back
and
forth
all
day
ihjel
told
him
and
you
wo
get
the
right
idea
unless
he
broke
off
suddenly
staring
at
the
communicator
the
operation
light
had
come
on
though
the
screen
stayed
dark
ihjel
reached
down
a
meaty
hand
and
pulled
loose
the
recently
connected
wires
that
doctor
of
yours
is
very
curious
and
he
going
to
stay
that
way
the
truth
behind
the
twenties
is
none
of
his
business
but
it
going
to
be
yours
you
must
come
to
realize
that
the
life
you
lead
here
is
a
complete
and
artificial
construction
developed
by
societics
experts
and
put
into
application
by
skilled
field
workers
nonsense
brion
broke
in
systems
of
society
ca
be
dreamed
up
and
forced
on
people
like
that
not
without
bloodshed
and
violence
nonsense
yourself
ihjel
told
him
that
may
have
been
true
in
the
dawn
of
history
but
not
any
more
you
have
been
reading
too
many
of
the
old
earth
classics
you
imagine
that
we
still
live
in
the
ages
of
superstition
just
because
fascism
and
communism
were
once
forced
on
reluctant
populations
you
think
this
holds
true
for
all
time
go
back
to
your
books
in
exactly
the
same
era
democracy
and
were
adapted
by
former
colonial
states
like
india
and
the
union
of
north
africa
and
the
only
violence
was
between
local
religious
groups
change
is
the
lifeblood
of
mankind
everything
we
today
accept
as
normal
was
at
one
time
an
innovation
and
one
of
the
most
recent
innovations
is
the
attempt
to
guide
the
societies
of
mankind
into
something
more
consistent
with
the
personal
happiness
of
individuals
the
god
complex
brion
said
forcing
human
lives
into
a
mold
whether
they
want
to
be
fitted
into
it
or
not
societies
can
be
that
ihjel
agreed
it
was
in
the
beginning
and
there
were
some
disastrous
results
of
attempts
to
force
populations
into
a
political
climate
where
they
did
belong
they
were
all
failures
anvhar
here
is
a
striking
example
of
how
good
the
technique
can
be
when
correctly
applied
it
not
done
this
way
any
more
though
as
with
all
of
the
other
sciences
we
have
found
out
that
the
more
we
know
the
more
there
is
to
know
we
no
longer
attempt
to
guide
cultures
towards
what
we
consider
a
beneficial
goal
there
are
too
many
goals
and
from
our
limited
vantage
point
it
is
hard
to
tell
the
good
ones
from
the
bad
ones
all
we
do
now
is
try
to
protect
the
growing
cultures
give
a
little
jolt
to
the
stagnating
ones
and
bury
the
dead
ones
when
the
work
was
first
done
here
on
anvhar
the
theory
had
progressed
that
far
the
understandably
complex
equations
that
determine
just
where
in
the
scale
from
a
type
i
to
a
type
v
a
culture
is
had
not
yet
been
completed
the
technique
then
was
to
work
out
an
artificial
culture
that
would
be
most
beneficial
for
a
planet
then
bend
it
into
the
mold
how
can
that
be
done
brion
asked
how
was
it
done
here
we
made
some
progress
you
finally
asking
the
technique
here
took
a
good
number
of
agents
and
a
great
deal
of
money
personal
honor
was
emphasized
in
order
to
encourage
dueling
and
this
led
to
a
heightened
interest
in
the
technique
of
personal
combat
when
this
was
well
intrenched
giroldi
was
brought
in
and
he
showed
how
organized
competitions
could
be
more
interesting
than
haphazard
encounters
tying
the
intellectual
aspects
onto
the
framework
of
competitive
sports
was
a
little
more
difficult
but
not
overwhelmingly
so
the
details
are
important
all
we
are
considering
now
is
the
end
product
which
is
you
you
needed
very
much
why
me
brion
asked
why
am
i
special
because
i
won
the
twenties
i
ca
believe
that
taken
objectively
there
is
that
much
difference
between
myself
and
the
ten
why
do
you
ask
one
of
them
they
could
do
your
job
as
well
as
i
no
they
could
i
tell
you
later
why
you
are
the
only
man
i
can
use
our
time
is
running
out
and
i
must
convince
you
of
some
other
things
first
ihjel
glanced
at
his
watch
we
have
less
than
three
hours
to
before
that
time
i
must
explain
enough
of
our
work
to
you
to
enable
you
to
decide
voluntarily
to
join
us
a
very
tall
order
brion
said
you
might
begin
by
telling
me
just
who
this
mysterious
is
that
you
keep
referring
to
the
cultural
relationships
foundation
a
body
privately
endowed
existing
to
promote
peace
and
ensure
the
sovereign
welfare
of
independent
planets
so
that
all
will
prosper
from
the
good
will
and
commerce
thereby
engendered
sounds
as
if
you
quoting
brion
told
him
no
one
could
possibly
make
up
something
that
sounds
like
that
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
i
quoting
from
our
charter
of
organization
which
is
all
very
fine
in
a
general
sense
but
i
talking
specifically
now
about
you
you
are
the
product
of
a
tightly
knit
and
very
advanced
society
your
individuality
has
been
encouraged
by
your
growing
up
in
a
society
so
small
in
population
that
a
mild
form
of
government
control
is
necessary
the
normal
anvharian
education
is
an
excellent
one
and
participation
in
the
twenties
has
given
you
a
general
and
advanced
education
second
to
none
in
the
galaxy
it
would
be
a
complete
waste
of
your
entire
life
if
you
now
took
all
this
training
and
wasted
it
on
some
rustic
farm
you
give
me
very
little
credit
i
plan
to
teach
forget
anvhar
ihjel
cut
him
off
with
a
chop
of
his
hand
this
world
will
roll
on
quite
successfully
whether
you
are
here
or
not
you
must
forget
it
think
of
its
relative
unimportance
on
a
galactic
scale
and
consider
instead
the
existing
suffering
hordes
of
mankind
you
must
think
what
you
can
do
to
help
them
but
what
can
i
do
as
an
individual
the
day
is
long
past
when
a
single
man
like
caesar
or
alexander
could
bring
about
changes
true
but
not
true
ihjel
said
there
are
key
men
in
every
conflict
of
forces
men
who
act
like
catalysts
applied
at
the
right
instant
to
start
a
chemical
reaction
you
might
be
one
of
these
men
but
i
must
be
honest
and
say
that
i
ca
prove
it
yet
so
in
order
to
save
time
and
endless
discussion
i
think
i
will
have
to
spark
your
personal
sense
of
obligation
obligation
to
whom
to
mankind
of
course
to
the
countless
billions
of
dead
who
kept
the
whole
machine
rolling
along
that
allows
you
the
full
long
and
happy
life
you
enjoy
today
what
they
gave
to
you
you
must
pass
on
to
others
this
is
the
keystone
of
humanistic
morals
agreed
and
a
very
good
argument
in
the
long
run
but
not
one
that
is
going
to
tempt
me
out
of
this
bed
within
the
next
three
hours
a
point
of
success
ihjel
said
you
agree
with
the
general
argument
now
i
apply
it
specifically
to
you
here
is
the
statement
i
intend
to
prove
there
exists
a
planet
with
a
population
of
seven
million
people
unless
i
can
prevent
it
this
planet
will
be
completely
destroyed
it
is
my
job
to
stop
that
destruction
so
that
is
where
i
am
going
now
i
wo
be
able
to
do
the
job
alone
in
addition
to
others
i
need
you
not
anyone
like
you
but
you
and
you
alone
you
have
precious
little
time
left
to
convince
me
of
all
that
brion
told
him
so
let
me
make
the
job
easier
for
you
the
work
you
do
this
planet
the
imminent
danger
of
the
people
there
these
are
all
facts
that
you
can
undoubtedly
supply
i
take
a
chance
that
this
whole
thing
is
not
a
colossal
bluff
and
admit
that
given
time
you
could
verify
them
all
this
brings
the
argument
back
to
me
again
how
can
you
possibly
prove
that
i
am
the
only
person
in
the
galaxy
who
can
help
you
i
can
prove
it
by
your
singular
ability
the
thing
i
came
here
to
find
ability
i
am
different
in
no
way
from
the
other
men
on
my
planet
you
wrong
ihjel
said
you
are
the
embodied
proof
of
evolution
rare
individuals
with
specific
talents
occur
constantly
in
any
species
man
included
it
has
been
two
generations
since
an
empathetic
was
last
born
on
anvhar
and
i
have
been
watching
carefully
most
of
that
time
what
in
blazes
is
an
empathetic
and
how
do
you
recognize
it
when
you
have
found
it
brion
chuckled
this
talk
was
getting
preposterous
i
can
recognize
one
because
i
one
myself
there
is
no
other
way
as
to
how
projective
empathy
works
you
had
a
demonstration
of
that
a
little
earlier
when
you
felt
those
strange
thoughts
about
anvhar
it
will
be
a
long
time
before
you
can
master
that
but
receptive
empathy
is
your
natural
trait
this
is
mentally
entering
into
the
feeling
or
what
could
be
called
the
spirit
of
another
person
empathy
is
not
thought
perception
it
might
better
be
described
as
the
sensing
of
someone
else
emotional
makeup
feelings
and
attitudes
you
ca
lie
to
a
trained
empathetic
because
he
can
sense
the
real
attitude
behind
the
verbal
lies
even
your
undeveloped
talent
has
proved
immensely
useful
in
the
twenties
you
can
outguess
your
opponent
because
you
know
his
movements
even
as
his
body
tenses
to
make
them
you
accept
this
without
ever
questioning
it
how
do
you
know
this
was
brion
understood
but
never
voiced
secret
ihjel
smiled
just
guessing
but
i
won
the
twenties
too
remember
also
without
knowing
a
thing
about
empathy
at
the
time
on
top
of
our
normal
training
it
a
wonderful
trait
to
have
which
brings
me
to
the
proof
we
mentioned
a
minute
ago
when
you
said
you
would
be
convinced
if
i
could
prove
you
were
the
only
person
who
could
help
me
i
you
are
and
that
is
one
thing
i
can
not
lie
about
it
possible
to
lie
about
a
belief
verbally
to
have
a
falsely
based
belief
or
to
change
a
belief
but
you
ca
lie
about
it
to
yourself
equally
important
you
ca
lie
about
a
belief
to
an
empathetic
would
you
like
to
see
how
i
feel
about
this
is
a
bad
word
there
is
no
vocabulary
yet
for
this
kind
of
thing
better
would
you
join
me
in
my
feelings
sense
my
attitudes
memories
and
emotions
just
as
i
do
brion
tried
to
protest
but
he
was
too
late
the
doors
of
his
senses
were
pushed
wide
and
he
was
overwhelmed
dis
ihjel
said
aloud
seven
million
people
hydrogen
bombs
brion
brandd
these
were
just
key
words
landmarks
of
association
with
each
one
brion
felt
the
rushing
wave
of
the
other
man
emotions
there
could
be
no
lies
here
ihjel
was
right
in
that
this
was
the
raw
stuff
that
feelings
are
made
of
the
basic
reactions
to
the
things
and
symbols
of
memory
dis
dis
dis
it
was
a
word
it
was
a
planet
and
the
word
thundered
like
a
drum
a
drum
the
sound
of
its
thunder
surrounded
and
was
a
wasteland
a
planet
of
death
a
planet
where
living
was
dying
and
dying
was
very
better
than
living
crude
barbaric
dis
hot
burning
scorching
backward
miserable
wasteland
of
sands
dirty
beneath
and
sands
and
sands
and
consideration
sands
that
burned
had
planet
burned
will
burn
forever
the
people
of
this
planet
so
crude
dirty
miserable
barbaric
but
they
were
going
to
be
dead
and
dead
they
would
be
seven
million
blackened
corpses
that
would
blacken
your
dreams
all
dreams
dreams
forever
because
those
h
y
d
r
o
g
e
n
b
o
m
b
s
were
waiting
to
kill
them
unless
unless
unless
you
ihjel
stopped
it
you
ihjel
death
you
death
you
death
alone
could
do
it
you
death
must
have
brion
brandd
he
was
the
only
one
in
the
galaxy
who
could
finish
the
job
as
the
flow
of
sensation
died
away
brion
realized
he
was
sprawled
back
weakly
on
his
pillows
soaked
with
sweat
washed
with
the
memory
of
the
raw
emotion
across
from
him
ihjel
sat
with
his
face
bowed
in
his
hands
when
he
lifted
his
head
brion
saw
within
his
eyes
a
shadow
of
the
blackness
he
had
just
experienced
death
brion
said
that
terrible
feeling
of
death
it
was
just
the
people
of
dis
who
would
die
it
was
something
more
personal
myself
ihjel
said
and
behind
this
simple
word
were
the
repeated
echoes
of
night
that
brion
had
been
made
aware
of
with
his
newly
recognized
ability
my
own
death
not
too
far
away
this
is
the
wonderfully
terrible
price
you
must
pay
for
your
talent
is
an
inescapable
part
of
empathy
it
is
a
part
of
the
whole
unknown
field
of
psi
phenomena
that
seems
to
be
independent
of
time
death
is
so
traumatic
and
final
that
it
reverberates
back
along
the
time
line
the
closer
i
get
the
more
aware
of
it
i
am
there
is
no
exact
feeling
of
date
just
a
rough
location
in
time
that
is
the
horror
of
it
i
i
will
die
soon
after
i
get
to
dis
and
long
before
the
work
there
is
finished
i
know
the
job
to
be
done
there
and
i
know
the
men
who
have
already
failed
at
it
i
also
know
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
possibly
complete
the
work
i
have
started
do
you
agree
now
will
you
come
with
me
yes
of
course
brion
said
i
go
with
you
iv
i
never
seen
anyone
quite
as
angry
as
that
doctor
brion
said
ca
blame
him
ihjel
shifted
his
immense
weight
and
grunted
from
the
console
where
he
was
having
a
coded
conversation
with
the
ship
brain
he
hit
the
keys
quickly
and
read
the
answer
from
the
screen
you
took
away
his
medical
moment
of
glory
how
many
times
in
his
life
will
he
have
a
chance
to
nurse
back
to
rugged
smiling
health
the
triumphantly
exhausted
winner
of
the
twenties
not
many
i
imagine
the
wonder
of
it
is
how
you
managed
to
convince
him
that
you
and
the
ship
here
could
take
care
of
me
as
well
as
his
hospital
could
i
could
never
convince
him
of
that
ihjel
said
but
i
and
the
cultural
relationships
foundation
have
some
powerful
friends
on
anvhar
i
forced
to
admit
i
brought
a
little
pressure
to
bear
he
leaned
back
and
read
the
course
tape
as
it
streamed
out
of
the
printer
we
have
a
little
time
to
spare
but
i
would
rather
spend
it
waiting
at
the
other
end
we
blast
as
soon
as
i
have
you
tied
down
in
a
stasis
field
the
completeness
of
the
stasis
field
leaves
no
impressions
on
the
body
or
mind
in
it
there
is
no
weight
no
pressure
no
pain
no
sensation
of
any
kind
except
for
a
stasis
of
very
long
duration
there
is
no
sensation
of
time
to
brion
consciousness
ihjel
flipped
the
switch
off
with
a
continuation
of
the
same
motion
that
had
turned
it
on
the
ship
was
unchanged
only
outside
of
the
port
was
the
blankness
of
how
do
you
feel
ihjel
asked
apparently
the
ship
was
wondering
the
same
thing
its
detector
unit
hovering
impatiently
just
outside
of
brion
stasis
field
darted
down
and
settled
on
his
bare
forearm
the
doctor
back
on
anvhar
had
given
the
medical
section
of
the
ship
brain
a
complete
briefing
a
quick
check
of
a
dozen
factors
of
brion
metabolism
was
compared
to
the
expected
norm
apparently
everything
was
going
well
because
the
only
reaction
was
the
expected
injection
of
vitamins
and
glucose
i
ca
say
i
feeling
wonderful
yet
brion
answered
levering
himself
higher
on
the
pillows
but
every
day
it
a
bit
better
steady
progress
i
hope
so
because
we
have
about
two
weeks
before
we
get
to
dis
do
you
think
you
be
back
in
shape
by
that
time
no
promises
brion
said
giving
a
tentative
squeeze
to
one
bicep
it
should
be
enough
time
though
tomorrow
i
start
mild
exercise
and
that
will
tighten
me
up
again
now
tell
me
more
about
dis
and
what
you
have
to
do
there
i
not
going
to
do
it
twice
so
just
save
your
curiosity
awhile
we
heading
for
a
rendezvous
point
now
to
pick
up
another
operator
this
is
going
to
be
a
team
you
me
and
an
exobiologist
as
soon
as
he
is
aboard
i
do
a
complete
briefing
for
you
both
at
the
same
time
what
you
can
do
now
is
get
your
head
into
the
language
box
and
start
working
on
your
disan
you
want
to
speak
it
perfectly
by
the
time
we
touchdown
with
an
autohypno
for
complete
recall
brion
had
no
difficulty
in
mastering
the
grammar
and
vocabulary
of
disan
pronunciation
was
a
different
matter
altogether
almost
all
the
word
endings
were
swallowed
muffled
or
gargled
the
language
was
rich
in
glottal
stops
clicks
and
guttural
strangling
sounds
ihjel
stayed
in
a
different
part
of
the
ship
when
brion
used
the
voice
mirror
and
analysis
scope
claiming
that
the
awful
noises
interfered
with
his
digestion
their
ship
angled
through
along
its
calculated
course
it
kept
its
fragile
human
cargo
warm
fed
them
and
supplied
breathable
air
it
had
orders
to
worry
about
brion
health
so
it
did
checking
constantly
against
its
recorded
instructions
and
noting
his
steady
progress
another
part
of
the
ship
brain
counted
microseconds
with
moronic
fixation
finally
closing
a
relay
when
a
predetermined
number
had
expired
in
its
heart
a
light
flashed
and
a
buzzer
hummed
gently
but
insistently
ihjel
yawned
put
away
the
report
he
had
been
reading
and
started
for
the
control
room
he
shuddered
when
he
passed
the
room
where
brion
was
listening
to
a
playback
of
his
disan
efforts
turn
off
that
dying
brontosaurus
and
get
strapped
in
he
called
through
the
thin
door
we
coming
to
the
point
of
optimum
possibility
and
we
be
dropping
back
into
normal
space
soon
the
human
mind
can
ponder
the
incredible
distances
between
the
stars
but
can
not
possibly
contain
within
itself
a
real
understanding
of
them
marked
out
on
a
man
hand
an
inch
is
a
large
unit
of
measure
in
interstellar
space
a
cubical
area
with
sides
a
hundred
thousand
miles
long
is
a
microscopically
fine
division
light
crosses
this
distance
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
to
a
ship
moving
with
a
relative
speed
far
greater
than
that
of
light
this
measuring
unit
is
even
smaller
theoretically
it
appears
impossible
to
find
a
particular
area
of
this
size
technologically
it
was
a
repeatable
miracle
that
occurred
too
often
to
even
be
interesting
brion
and
ihjel
were
strapped
in
when
the
cut
off
abruptly
lurching
them
back
into
normal
space
and
time
they
unstrap
but
just
sat
and
looked
at
the
dimly
distant
pattern
of
stars
a
single
sun
apparently
of
fifth
magnitude
was
their
only
neighbor
in
this
lost
corner
of
the
universe
they
waited
while
the
computer
took
enough
star
sights
to
triangulate
a
position
in
three
dimensions
muttering
to
itself
electronically
while
it
did
the
countless
calculations
to
find
their
position
a
warning
bell
chimed
and
the
drive
cut
on
and
off
so
quickly
that
the
two
acts
seemed
simultaneous
this
happened
again
twice
before
the
brain
was
satisfied
it
had
made
as
good
a
fix
as
possible
and
flashed
a
navigation
power
off
light
ihjel
unstrapped
stretched
and
made
them
a
meal
ihjel
had
computed
their
passage
time
with
precise
allowances
less
than
ten
hours
after
they
arrived
a
powerful
signal
blasted
into
their
waiting
receiver
they
strapped
in
again
as
the
navigation
power
on
signal
blinked
insistently
a
ship
had
paused
in
flight
somewhere
relatively
near
in
the
vast
volume
of
space
it
had
entered
normal
space
just
long
enough
to
emit
a
signal
of
radio
query
on
an
assigned
wave
length
ship
had
detected
this
and
instantly
responded
with
a
verifying
signal
the
passenger
spacer
had
accepted
this
assurance
and
gracefully
laid
a
metal
egg
in
space
as
soon
as
this
had
cleared
its
jump
field
the
parent
ship
vanished
towards
its
destination
light
years
away
ihjel
ship
climbed
up
the
signal
it
had
received
this
signal
had
been
recorded
and
examined
minutely
angle
strength
and
doppler
movement
were
computed
to
find
course
and
distance
a
few
minutes
of
flight
were
enough
to
get
within
range
of
the
far
weaker
transmitter
in
the
homing
on
this
signal
was
so
simple
a
human
pilot
could
have
done
it
himself
the
shining
sphere
loomed
up
then
vanished
out
of
sight
of
the
viewports
as
the
ship
rotated
to
bring
the
spacelock
into
line
magnetic
clamps
cut
in
when
they
made
contact
go
down
and
let
the
in
ihjel
said
i
stay
and
monitor
the
board
in
case
of
trouble
what
do
i
have
to
do
get
into
a
suit
and
open
the
outer
lock
most
of
the
drop
sphere
is
made
of
inflatable
metallic
foil
so
do
bother
to
look
for
the
entrance
just
cut
a
hole
in
it
with
the
oversize
find
in
the
tool
box
after
morees
gets
aboard
jettison
the
thing
only
get
the
radio
and
locator
unit
out
first
it
gets
used
again
the
tool
did
look
like
a
giant
brion
carefully
felt
the
resilient
metal
skin
that
covered
the
lock
entrance
until
he
was
sure
there
was
nothing
on
the
other
side
then
he
jabbed
the
point
through
and
cut
a
ragged
hole
in
the
thin
foil
morees
boiled
out
of
the
sphere
knocking
brion
aside
what
the
matter
brion
asked
there
was
no
radio
on
the
other
suit
he
could
answer
but
he
did
shake
his
fist
angrily
the
helmet
ports
were
opaque
so
there
was
no
way
to
tell
what
expressions
went
with
the
gesture
brion
shrugged
and
turned
back
to
salvaging
the
equipment
pack
pushing
the
punctured
balloon
free
and
sealing
the
lock
when
pressure
was
pumped
back
to
he
cracked
his
helmet
and
motioned
the
other
to
do
the
same
you
a
pack
of
dirty
lying
dogs
morees
said
when
the
helmet
came
off
brion
was
completely
baffled
lea
morees
had
long
dark
hair
large
eyes
and
a
delicately
shaped
mouth
now
taut
with
anger
morees
was
a
woman
are
you
the
filthy
swine
responsible
for
this
atrocity
morees
asked
menacingly
in
the
control
room
brion
said
quickly
knowing
when
cowardice
was
preferable
to
valor
a
man
named
ihjel
there
a
lot
of
him
to
hate
you
can
have
a
good
time
doing
it
i
just
joined
up
myself
he
was
talking
to
her
back
as
she
stormed
from
the
room
brion
hurried
after
her
not
wanting
to
miss
the
first
human
spark
of
interest
in
the
trip
to
date
kidnapped
lied
to
and
forced
against
my
will
there
is
no
court
in
the
galaxy
that
wo
give
you
the
maximum
sentence
and
scream
with
pleasure
as
they
roll
your
fat
body
into
solitary
they
should
have
sent
a
woman
ihjel
said
completely
ignoring
her
words
i
asked
for
a
highly
qualified
exobiologist
for
a
difficult
assignment
someone
young
and
tough
enough
to
do
field
work
under
severe
conditions
so
the
recruiting
office
sends
me
the
smallest
female
they
can
find
one
who
melt
in
the
first
rain
i
will
not
lea
shouted
female
resiliency
is
a
fact
and
i
in
far
better
condition
than
the
average
woman
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
what
i
telling
you
i
was
hired
for
a
job
in
the
university
on
moller
world
and
signed
a
contract
to
that
effect
then
this
bully
of
an
agent
tells
me
the
contract
has
been
changed
read
subparagraph
or
some
such
nonsense
and
i
be
transhipping
he
stuffed
me
into
that
suffocating
basketball
without
a
and
they
threw
me
overboard
if
that
is
not
a
violation
of
personal
privacy
cut
a
new
course
brion
ihjel
broke
in
find
the
nearest
settled
planet
and
head
us
there
we
have
to
drop
this
woman
and
find
a
man
for
this
job
we
are
going
to
what
is
undoubtedly
the
most
interesting
planet
an
exobiologist
ever
conceived
of
but
we
need
a
man
who
can
take
orders
and
not
faint
when
it
gets
too
hot
brion
was
lost
ihjel
had
done
all
the
navigating
and
brion
had
no
idea
how
to
begin
a
search
like
this
oh
no
you
do
lea
said
you
do
get
rid
of
me
that
easily
i
placed
first
in
my
class
and
most
of
the
five
hundred
other
students
were
male
this
is
only
a
man
universe
because
the
men
say
so
what
is
the
name
of
this
garden
planet
where
we
are
going
dis
i
give
you
a
briefing
as
soon
as
i
get
this
ship
on
course
he
turned
to
the
controls
and
lea
slipped
out
of
her
suit
and
went
into
the
lavatory
to
comb
her
hair
brion
closed
his
mouth
aware
suddenly
it
had
been
open
for
a
long
time
is
that
what
you
call
applied
psychology
he
asked
not
really
she
was
going
to
go
along
with
the
job
in
the
end
since
she
did
sign
the
contract
even
if
she
did
read
the
fine
print
but
not
until
she
had
exhausted
her
feelings
i
just
shortened
the
process
by
switching
her
onto
the
hate
most
women
who
succeed
in
normally
masculine
fields
have
a
reflexive
antipathy
there
they
have
been
hit
on
the
head
with
it
so
much
he
fed
the
course
tape
into
the
console
and
scowled
but
there
was
a
good
chunk
of
truth
in
what
i
said
i
wanted
a
young
fit
and
highly
qualified
biologist
from
recruiting
i
never
thought
they
would
find
a
female
one
and
it
too
late
to
send
her
back
now
dis
is
no
place
for
a
woman
why
brion
asked
as
lea
appeared
in
the
doorway
come
inside
and
i
show
you
both
ihjel
said
v
dis
ihjel
said
consulting
a
thick
file
third
planet
out
from
its
primary
epsilon
eridani
the
fourth
planet
is
nyjord
remember
that
because
it
is
going
to
be
very
important
dis
is
a
place
you
need
a
good
reason
to
visit
and
no
reason
at
all
to
leave
too
hot
too
dry
the
temperature
in
the
temperate
zones
rarely
drops
below
a
hundred
fahrenheit
the
planet
is
nothing
but
scorched
rock
and
burning
sand
most
of
the
water
is
underground
and
normally
inaccessible
the
surface
water
is
all
in
the
form
of
briny
chemically
saturated
swamps
undrinkable
without
extensive
processing
all
the
facts
and
figures
are
here
in
the
folder
and
you
can
study
them
later
right
now
i
want
you
just
to
get
the
idea
that
this
planet
is
as
loathsome
and
inhospitable
as
they
come
so
are
the
people
this
is
a
solido
of
a
disan
lea
gasped
at
the
representation
on
the
screen
not
at
the
physical
aspects
of
the
man
as
a
biologist
trained
in
the
specialty
of
alien
life
she
had
seen
a
lot
stranger
sights
it
was
the
man
pose
the
expression
on
his
face
tensed
to
leap
his
lips
drawn
back
to
show
all
of
this
teeth
he
looks
as
if
he
wanted
to
kill
the
photographer
she
said
he
almost
did
just
after
the
picture
was
taken
like
all
disans
he
has
an
overwhelming
hatred
and
loathing
of
offworlders
not
without
good
reason
though
his
planet
was
settled
completely
by
chance
during
the
breakdown
i
not
sure
of
the
details
but
the
overall
picture
is
clear
since
the
story
of
their
desertion
forms
the
basis
of
all
the
myths
and
animistic
religions
on
dis
apparently
there
were
mining
operations
carried
on
there
once
the
world
is
rich
enough
in
minerals
and
mining
them
is
very
simple
but
water
came
only
from
expensive
extraction
processes
and
i
imagine
most
of
the
food
came
from
offworld
which
was
good
enough
until
the
settlement
was
forgotten
the
way
a
lot
of
other
planets
were
during
the
breakdown
all
the
records
were
destroyed
in
the
fighting
and
the
ore
carriers
were
pressed
into
military
service
dis
was
on
its
own
what
happened
to
the
people
there
is
a
tribute
to
the
adaptation
possibilities
of
homo
sapiens
individuals
died
usually
in
enormous
pain
but
the
race
lived
changed
a
good
deal
but
still
human
as
the
water
and
food
ran
out
and
the
extraction
machinery
broke
down
they
must
have
made
heroic
efforts
to
survive
they
could
do
it
mechanically
but
by
the
time
the
last
machine
collapsed
enough
people
were
adjusted
to
the
environment
to
keep
the
race
going
their
descendants
are
still
there
completely
adapted
to
the
environment
their
body
temperatures
are
around
a
hundred
and
thirty
degrees
they
have
specialized
tissue
in
the
gluteal
area
for
storing
water
these
are
minor
changes
compared
to
the
major
ones
they
have
done
in
fitting
themselves
for
this
planet
i
do
know
the
exact
details
but
the
reports
are
very
enthusiastic
about
symbiotic
relationships
they
assure
us
that
this
is
the
first
time
homo
sapiens
has
been
an
active
part
of
either
commensalism
or
inquilinism
other
than
in
the
role
of
host
wonderful
lea
exclaimed
is
it
ihjel
scowled
perhaps
from
the
abstract
scientific
point
of
view
if
you
can
keep
notes
perhaps
you
might
write
a
book
about
it
some
time
but
i
not
interested
i
sure
all
these
morphological
changes
and
disgusting
intimacies
will
fascinate
you
morees
but
while
you
are
counting
blood
types
and
admiring
your
thermometers
i
hope
you
will
be
able
to
devote
a
little
time
to
a
study
of
the
disans
obnoxious
personalities
we
must
either
find
out
what
makes
these
people
tick
or
we
are
going
to
have
to
stand
by
and
watch
the
whole
lot
blown
up
going
to
do
what
lea
gasped
destroy
them
wipe
out
this
fascinating
genetic
pool
why
because
they
are
so
incredibly
loathsome
that
why
ihjel
said
these
aboriginal
hotheads
have
managed
to
lay
their
hands
on
some
primitive
cobalt
bombs
they
want
to
light
the
fuse
and
drop
these
bombs
on
nyjord
the
next
planet
nothing
said
or
done
can
convince
them
differently
they
demand
unconditional
surrender
or
else
this
is
impossible
for
a
lot
of
reasons
most
important
because
the
nyjorders
would
like
to
keep
their
planet
for
their
very
own
they
have
tried
every
kind
of
compromise
but
none
of
them
works
the
disans
are
out
to
commit
racial
suicide
a
nyjord
fleet
is
now
over
dis
and
the
deadline
has
almost
expired
for
the
surrender
of
the
cobalt
bombs
the
nyjord
ships
carry
enough
to
turn
the
entire
planet
into
an
atomic
pile
that
is
what
we
must
stop
brion
looked
at
the
solido
on
the
screen
trying
to
make
some
judgment
of
the
man
bare
horny
feet
a
bulky
ragged
length
of
cloth
around
the
waist
was
the
only
garment
what
looked
like
a
piece
of
green
vine
was
hooked
over
one
shoulder
from
a
plaited
belt
were
suspended
a
number
of
odd
devices
made
of
metal
drilled
stone
and
looped
leather
the
only
recognizable
item
was
a
thin
knife
of
unusual
design
loops
of
piping
flared
bells
carved
stones
tied
in
senseless
patterns
of
thonging
gave
the
rest
of
the
collection
a
bizarre
appearance
perhaps
they
had
some
religious
significance
but
the
and
handled
look
of
most
of
them
gave
brion
an
uneasy
sensation
if
they
were
used
what
in
the
universe
could
they
be
used
i
ca
believe
it
he
finally
concluded
except
for
the
exotic
hardware
this
lowbrow
looks
as
if
he
has
sunk
back
into
the
stone
age
i
do
see
how
his
kind
can
be
any
real
threat
to
another
planet
the
nyjorders
believe
it
and
that
good
enough
for
me
ihjel
said
they
are
paying
our
cultural
relationships
foundation
a
good
sum
to
try
and
prevent
this
war
since
they
are
our
employers
we
must
do
what
they
ask
brion
ignored
this
large
lie
since
it
was
obviously
designed
as
an
explanation
for
lea
but
he
made
a
mental
note
to
query
ihjel
later
about
the
real
situation
here
are
the
tech
reports
ihjel
dropped
them
on
the
table
dis
has
some
spacers
as
well
as
the
cobalt
bombs
though
these
the
real
threat
a
tramp
trader
was
picked
up
dis
it
had
delivered
a
launcher
that
can
drop
those
bombs
on
nyjord
while
anchored
to
the
bedrock
of
dis
while
essentially
a
peaceful
and
happy
people
the
nyjorders
were
justifiably
annoyed
at
this
and
convinced
the
tramp
captain
to
give
them
some
more
information
it
all
here
boiled
down
it
gives
a
minimum
deadline
by
which
time
the
launcher
can
be
set
up
and
start
throwing
bombs
when
is
that
deadline
lea
asked
in
ten
more
days
if
the
situation
has
been
changed
drastically
by
then
the
nyjorders
are
going
to
wipe
all
life
from
the
face
of
dis
i
assure
you
they
do
want
to
do
it
but
they
will
drop
the
bombs
in
order
to
assure
their
own
survival
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
lea
asked
flipping
the
pages
of
the
report
i
do
know
a
thing
about
nucleonics
or
an
exobiologist
with
a
supplementary
degree
in
anthropology
what
help
could
i
possibly
be
ihjel
looked
down
at
her
stroking
his
jaw
fingers
sunk
deep
into
the
rolls
of
flesh
my
faith
in
our
recruiters
is
restored
he
said
that
a
combination
that
is
probably
rare
even
on
earth
you
as
scrawny
as
an
underfed
chicken
but
young
enough
to
survive
if
we
keep
a
close
eye
on
you
he
cut
off
lea
angry
protest
with
a
raised
hand
no
more
bickering
there
is
time
the
nyjorders
must
have
lost
over
thirty
agents
trying
to
find
the
bombs
our
foundation
has
had
six
people
killed
including
my
late
predecessor
in
charge
of
the
project
he
was
a
good
man
but
i
think
he
went
at
this
problem
the
wrong
way
i
think
it
is
a
cultural
one
not
a
physical
one
run
it
through
again
with
the
power
turned
up
lea
said
frowning
all
i
hear
is
static
it
the
old
problem
of
genesis
like
newton
and
the
falling
apple
levy
and
the
hysteresis
in
the
warp
field
everything
has
a
beginning
if
we
can
find
out
why
these
people
are
so
on
suicide
we
might
be
able
to
change
the
reasons
not
that
i
intend
to
stop
looking
for
the
bombs
or
the
generator
either
we
are
going
to
try
anything
that
will
avert
this
planetary
murder
you
a
lot
brighter
than
you
look
lea
said
rising
and
carefully
stacking
the
sheets
of
the
report
you
can
count
on
me
for
complete
cooperation
now
i
study
all
this
in
bed
if
one
of
you
overweight
gentlemen
will
show
me
to
a
room
with
a
strong
lock
on
the
inside
of
the
door
do
call
me
i
call
you
when
i
want
breakfast
brion
was
sure
how
much
of
her
barbed
speech
was
humor
and
how
much
was
serious
so
he
said
nothing
he
showed
her
to
an
empty
cabin
she
did
lock
the
door
then
looked
for
ihjel
the
winner
was
in
the
galley
adding
to
his
girth
with
an
immense
gelatin
dessert
that
filled
a
tureen
is
she
short
for
a
native
terran
brion
asked
the
top
of
her
head
is
below
my
chin
that
the
norm
earth
is
a
reservoir
of
tired
genes
weak
backs
vermiform
appendixes
bad
eyes
if
they
did
have
the
universities
and
the
trained
people
we
need
i
would
never
use
them
why
did
you
lie
to
her
about
the
foundation
because
it
a
secret
is
that
reason
enough
ihjel
rumbled
angrily
scraping
the
last
dregs
from
the
bowl
better
eat
something
build
up
the
strength
the
foundation
has
to
maintain
its
undercover
status
if
it
is
going
to
accomplish
anything
if
she
returns
to
earth
after
this
it
better
that
she
should
know
nothing
of
our
real
work
if
she
joins
up
there
be
time
enough
to
tell
her
but
i
doubt
if
she
will
like
the
way
we
operate
particularly
since
i
plan
to
drop
some
on
dis
myself
if
we
ca
turn
off
the
war
i
do
believe
it
you
heard
me
correctly
do
bulge
your
eyes
and
look
moronic
as
a
last
resort
i
drop
the
bombs
myself
rather
than
let
the
nyjorders
do
it
that
might
save
them
save
them
they
all
be
radiated
and
dead
brion
voice
rose
in
anger
not
the
disans
i
want
to
save
the
nyjorders
stop
clenching
your
fists
and
sit
down
and
have
some
of
this
cake
it
delicious
the
nyjorders
are
all
that
counts
here
they
have
a
planet
blessed
by
the
laws
of
chance
when
dis
was
cut
off
from
outside
contact
the
survivors
turned
into
a
gang
of
swampcrawling
homicidals
it
did
the
opposite
for
nyjord
you
can
survive
there
just
by
pulling
fruit
off
a
tree
the
population
was
small
educated
intelligent
instead
of
sinking
into
an
eternal
siesta
they
matured
into
a
vitally
different
society
not
mechanical
they
were
even
using
the
wheel
when
they
were
rediscovered
they
became
sort
of
cultural
specialists
digging
deep
into
the
philosophical
aspects
of
interrelationship
the
thing
that
machine
societies
never
have
had
time
for
of
course
this
was
for
the
cultural
relationships
foundation
and
we
have
been
working
with
them
ever
since
not
guiding
so
much
as
protecting
them
from
any
blows
that
might
destroy
this
growing
idea
but
fallen
down
on
the
job
nonviolence
is
essential
to
these
people
they
have
vitality
without
needing
destruction
but
if
they
are
forced
to
blow
up
dis
for
their
own
survival
against
every
one
of
their
basic
tenets
their
philosophy
wo
endure
physically
they
live
on
as
just
one
more
planet
with
an
for
any
of
the
competition
who
drop
behind
sounds
like
paradise
now
do
be
smug
it
just
another
worldful
of
people
with
the
same
old
likes
dislikes
and
hatreds
but
they
are
evolving
a
way
of
living
together
without
violence
that
may
some
day
form
the
key
to
mankind
survival
they
are
worth
looking
after

the
quiet
words
from
the
speaker
in
no
way
appeared
to
coincide
with
the
picture
on
the
screen
the
spacer
that
had
matched
their
orbit
over
dis

recently

a

had
tacked
the

the

at

this

the

this
is
probably
a
change

and
i
do
like
the
smell
of
it
there
was
something
behind
ihjel
grumbling
this
time
and
without
conscious
effort
brion
could
sense
the
chilling
touch
of
the
other

trouble

waiting
for
them
on

when

ihjel
hovered

when
it
was

he
only
snorted
and
went

dropping

was
safe
enough
it
was
done
on

and
the
disans
were
thought
to
have
no

apparatus
the
altimeter
dials
spun
backwards
to
zero
and
a
soft
vibration
was
the
only
indication
they
had
landed
all
of
the
cabin
lights
were
off
except
for
the
fluorescent
glow
of
the
instruments
a
grey
filled
the

radiation
from
the
still
warm
sand
and

there
were
no

asked
patting
her
forehead
with
an
already
sodden
kerchief
stripped
of
her
heavier
clothing
she
looked
even
tinier
to
brion
but
the
thin
cloth
tunic
reaching
barely
halfway
to
her
knees
concealed
very
little
small
she
may
have
appeared
to
him
unfeminine
she
was
not
her
breasts
were
full
and
high
her
waist
tiny
enough
to
offset
the
outward
curve
of
her
hips
shall
i
turn
around
so
you
can
stare
at
the
back
too
she
asked
brion
five
days
experience
had
taught
him
that
this
type
of
remark
was
best
ignored
it
only
became
worse
if
he
tried
to
make
an
intelligent
answer
dis
is
hotter
than
this
cabin
he
said
changing
the
subject
by
raising
the
interior
temperature
we
can
at
least
prevent
any
sudden
shock
when
we
go
out
i
know
the
theory
but
it
does
stop
me
from
sweating
she
said
curtly
best
thing
you
can
do
is
sweat
ihjel
said
he
looked
like
a
glistening
captive
balloon
in
shorts
finishing
a
bottle
of
beer
he
took
another
from
the
freezer
have
a
beer
no
thank
you
i
afraid
it
would
dissolve
the
last
shreds
of
tissue
and
my
kidneys
would
float
completely
away
on

we
never
get
professor
morees
luggage
for
her
ihjel
interrupted
coming
there
his
signal
i
sending
this
ship
up
before
any
of
the
locals
spot
it
when
he
cracked
the
outer
port
the
puff
of
air
struck
them
like
the
exhaust
from
a
furnace
dry
and
hot
as
a
tongue
of
flame
brion
heard
lea
gasp
in
the
darkness
she
stumbled
down
the
ramp
and
he
followed
her
slowly
careful
of
the
weight
of
packs
and
equipment
he
carried
the
sand
still
hot
from
the
day
burned
through
his
boots
ihjel
came
last
the
unit
in
his
hand
as
soon
as
they
were
clear
he
activated
it
and
the
ramp
slipped
back
like
a
giant
tongue
as
soon
as
the
lock
had
swung
shut
the
ship
lifted
and
drifted
upwards
silently
towards
its
orbit
a
shrinking
darkness
against
the
stars
there
was
just
enough
starlight
to
see
the
sandy
wastes
around
them
as
as
a
petrified
sea
the
dark
shape
of
a
sand
car
drew
up
over
a
dune
and
hummed
to
a
stop
when
the
door
opened
ihjel
stepped
towards
it
and
everything
happened
at
once
ihjel
broke
into
a
blue
nimbus
of
crackling
flame
his
skin
blackening
charred
he
was
dead
in
an
instant
a
second
pillar
of
flame
bloomed
next
to
the
car
and
a
choking
scream
was
cut
off
at
the
moment
it
began
ihjel
died
silently
brion
was
diving
even
as
the
electrical
discharges
still
crackled
in
the
air
the
boxes
and
packs
dropped
from
him
and
he
slammed
against
lea
knocking
her
to
the
ground
he
hoped
she
had
the
sense
to
stay
there
and
be
quiet
this
was
his
only
conscious
thought
the
rest
was
reflex
he
was
rolling
over
and
over
as
fast
as
he
could
the
spitting
electrical
flames
flared
again
playing
over
the
bundles
of
luggage
he
had
dropped
this
time
brion
was
expecting
it
pressed
flat
on
the
ground
a
short
distance
away
he
was
facing
the
darkness
away
from
the
sand
car
and
saw
the
brief
blue
glow
of
the
discharge
his
own
gun
was
in
his
hand
when
ihjel
had
given
him
the
missile
weapon
he
had
asked
no
questions
but
had
just
strapped
it
on
there
had
been
no
thought
that
he
would
need
it
this
quickly
holding
it
firmly
before
him
in
both
hands
he
let
his
body
aim
at
the
spot
where
the
glow
had
been
a
whiplash
of
explosive
slugs
ripped
the
night
air
they
found
their
target
and
something
thrashed
voicelessly
and
died
in
the
brief
instant
after
he
fired
a
jarring
weight
landed
on
his
back
and
a
line
of
fire
circled
his
throat
normally
he
fought
with
a
calm
mind
with
no
thoughts
other
than
of
the
contest
but
ihjel
a
friend
a
man
of
anvhar
had
died
a
few
seconds
before
and
brion
found
himself
welcoming
this
physical
violence
and
pain
there
are
many
foolish
and
dangerous
things
that
can
be
done
such
as
smoking
next
to
fuel
and
putting
fingers
into
electrical
sockets
just
as
dangerous
and
equally
deadly
is
physically
attacking
a
winner
of
the
twenties
two
men
hit
brion
together
though
this
made
very
little
difference
the
first
died
suddenly
as
hands
like
steel
claws
found
his
neck
and
in
a
single
spasmodic
contraction
did
such
damage
to
the
large
blood
vessels
there
that
they
burst
and
tiny
hemorrhages
filled
his
brain
the
second
man
had
time
for
a
single
scream
though
he
died
just
as
swiftly
when
those
hands
closed
on
his
larynx
running
in
a
crouch
partially
on
his
knuckles
brion
swiftly
made
a
circle
of
the
area
gun
ready
there
were
no
others
only
when
he
touched
the
softness
of
lea
body
did
the
blood
anger
seep
from
him
he
was
suddenly
aware
of
the
pain
and
fatigue
the
sweat
soaking
his
body
and
the
breath
rasping
in
his
throat
holstering
the
gun
he
ran
light
fingers
over
her
skull
finding
a
bruised
spot
on
one
temple
her
chest
was
rising
and
falling
regularly
she
had
struck
her
head
when
he
pushed
her
it
had
undoubtedly
saved
her
life
sitting
down
suddenly
he
let
his
body
relax
breathing
deeply
everything
was
a
little
better
now
except
for
the
pain
at
his
throat
his
fingers
found
a
thin
strand
on
the
side
of
his
neck
with
a
knobby
weight
on
the
end
there
was
another
weight
on
his
other
shoulder
and
a
thin
line
of
pain
across
his
neck
when
he
pulled
on
them
both
the
strangler
cord
came
away
in
his
hand
it
was
thin
fiber
strong
as
a
wire
when
it
had
been
pulled
around
his
neck
it
had
sliced
the
surface
skin
and
flesh
like
a
knife
halted
only
by
the
corded
bands
of
muscle
below
brion
threw
it
from
him
into
the
darkness
where
it
had
come
from
he
could
think
again
and
he
carefully
kept
his
thoughts
from
the
men
he
had
killed
knowing
it
was
useless
he
went
to
ihjel
body
a
single
touch
of
the
scorched
flesh
was
enough
behind
him
lea
moaned
with
returning
consciousness
and
he
hurried
on
to
the
sand
car
stepping
over
the
charred
body
outside
the
door
the
driver
slumped
dead
killed
perhaps
by
the
same
strangling
cord
that
had
sunk
into
brion
throat
he
laid
the
man
gently
on
the
sand
and
closed
the
lids
over
the
staring
horror
of
the
eyes
there
was
a
canteen
in
the
car
and
he
brought
it
back
to
lea
my
head
i
hurt
my
head
she
said
groggily
just
a
bruise
he
reassured
her
drink
some
of
this
water
and
you
soon
feel
better
lie
back
everything
over
for
the
moment
and
you
can
rest
ihjel
dead
lea
said
with
sudden
shocked
memory
they
killed
him
what
happened
she
tensed
tried
to
rise
and
he
pressed
her
back
gently
i
tell
you
everything
just
do
try
to
get
up
yet
there
was
an
ambush
and
they
killed
vion
and
the
driver
of
the
sand
car
as
well
as
ihjel
three
men
did
it
and
they
all
dead
now
too
i
do
think
there
are
any
more
around
but
if
there
are
i
hear
them
coming
we
just
going
to
wait
a
few
minutes
until
you
feel
better
then
we
getting
out
of
here
in
the
car
bring
the
ship
down
there
was
a
thin
note
of
hysteria
in
her
voice
we
ca
stay
here
alone
we
do
know
where
to
go
or
what
to
do
with
ihjel
dead
the
whole
thing
spoiled
we
have
to
get
out
there
are
some
things
that
ca
sound
gentle
no
matter
how
gently
they
are
said
this
was
one
of
them
i
sorry
lea
but
the
ship
is
out
of
our
reach
right
now
ihjel
was
killed
with
an
ion
gun
and
it
fused
the
control
unit
into
a
solid
lump
we
must
take
the
car
and
get
to
the
city
we
do
it
now
see
if
you
can
stand
up
help
you
she
rose
not
saying
anything
and
as
they
walked
towards
the
car
a
single
reddish
moon
cleared
the
hills
behind
them
in
its
light
brion
saw
a
dark
line
bisecting
the
rear
panel
of
the
sand
car
he
stopped
abruptly
what
the
matter
lea
asked
the
unlocked
engine
cover
could
have
only
one
significance
and
he
pushed
it
open
knowing
in
advance
what
he
would
see
the
attackers
had
been
very
thorough
and
fast
in
the
short
time
available
to
them
they
had
killed
the
driver
and
the
car
as
well
ruddy
light
shone
on
torn
wires
ripped
out
connections
repair
would
be
impossible
i
think
we
have
to
walk
he
told
her
trying
to
keep
the
gloom
out
of
his
voice
this
spot
is
roughly
a
hundred
and
fifty
kilometres
from
the
city
of
hovedstad
where
we
have
to
go
we
should
be
able
to
we
going
to
die
we
ca
walk
anywhere
this
whole
planet
is
a
death
trap
let
get
back
in
the
ship
the
shrillness
of
hysteria
was
at
the
edge
of
her
voice
as
well
as
a
subtle
slurring
of
sounds
brion
did
try
to
reason
with
her
or
bother
to
explain
she
had
a
concussion
from
the
blow
that
much
was
obvious
he
had
her
sit
and
rest
while
he
made
what
preparations
he
could
for
the
long
walk
clothing
first
with
each
passing
minute
the
desert
air
was
growing
colder
as
the
day
heat
ebbed
away
lea
was
beginning
to
shiver
and
he
took
some
heavier
clothing
from
her
charred
bag
and
made
her
pull
it
on
over
her
light
tunic
there
was
little
else
that
was
worth
carrying
the
canteen
from
the
car
and
a
kit
he
found
in
one
of
the
compartments
there
were
no
maps
and
no
radio
navigation
was
obviously
done
by
compass
on
this
almost
featureless
desert
the
car
was
equipped
with
an
electrically
operated
gyrocompass
of
no
use
to
him
now
but
he
did
use
it
to
check
the
direction
of
hovedstad
as
he
remembered
it
from
the
map
and
found
it
lined
up
perfectly
with
the
tracks
the
car
had
cut
into
the
sand
it
had
come
directly
from
the
city
they
could
find
their
way
by
time
was
slipping
away
he
would
have
liked
to
bury
ihjel
and
the
men
from
the
car
but
the
night
hours
were
too
valuable
to
be
wasted
the
best
he
could
do
was
put
the
three
corpses
in
the
car
for
protection
from
the
disan
animals
he
locked
the
door
and
threw
the
key
as
far
as
he
could
into
the
blackness
lea
had
slipped
into
a
restless
sleep
and
he
carefully
shook
her
awake
come
brion
said
we
have
a
little
walking
to
do
vii
with
the
cool
air
and
firmly
packed
sand
under
foot
walking
should
have
been
easy
lea
spoiled
that
the
concussion
seemed
to
have
temporarily
cut
off
the
reasoning
part
of
her
brain
leaving
a
direct
connection
to
her
vocal
cords
as
she
stumbled
along
only
half
conscious
she
mumbled
all
of
her
darkest
fears
that
were
better
left
unvoiced
occasionally
there
was
relevancy
in
her
complaints
they
would
lose
their
way
never
find
the
city
die
of
thirst
freezing
heat
or
hunger
interspersed
and
entwined
with
these
were
fears
from
her
past
that
still
floated
submerged
in
the
timeless
ocean
of
her
subconscious
some
brion
could
understand
though
he
tried
not
to
listen
fears
of
losing
credits
not
getting
the
highest
grade
falling
behind
a
woman
alone
in
a
world
of
men
leaving
school
being
lost
trampled
among
the
nameless
hordes
that
struggled
for
survival
in
the
crowded
of
earth
there
were
other
things
she
was
afraid
of
that
made
no
sense
to
a
man
of
anvhar
who
were
the
alkians
that
seemed
to
trouble
her
or
what
was
canceri
daydle
and
haydle
who
was
manstan
whose
name
kept
coming
up
over
and
over
each
time
accompanied
by
a
little
moan
brion
stopped
and
picked
her
up
in
both
arms
with
a
sigh
she
settled
against
the
hard
width
of
his
chest
and
was
instantly
asleep
even
with
the
additional
weight
he
made
better
time
now
and
he
stretched
to
his
fastest
stride
to
make
good
use
of
these
best
hours
somewhere
on
a
stretch
of
gravel
and
shelving
rock
he
lost
the
track
of
the
sand
car
he
wasted
no
time
looking
for
it
by
carefully
watching
the
glistening
stars
rise
and
set
he
had
made
a
good
estimate
of
the
geographic
north
dis
did
seem
to
have
a
pole
star
however
a
boxlike
constellation
turned
slowly
around
the
invisible
point
of
the
pole
keeping
this
positioned
in
line
with
his
right
shoulder
guided
him
on
the
westerly
course
he
needed
when
his
arms
began
to
grow
tired
he
lowered
lea
gently
to
the
ground
she
did
wake
stretching
for
an
instant
before
taking
up
his
burden
again
brion
was
struck
by
the
terrible
loneliness
of
the
desert
his
breath
made
a
vanishing
mist
against
the
stars
all
else
was
darkness
and
silence
how
distant
he
was
from
his
home
his
people
his
planet
even
the
constellations
of
the
night
sky
were
different
he
was
used
to
solitude
but
this
was
a
loneliness
that
touched
some
instinct
a
shiver
that
was
from
the
desert
cold
touched
lightly
along
his
spine
prickling
at
the
hairs
on
his
neck
it
was
time
to
go
on
he
shrugged
the
disquieting
sensations
off
and
carefully
tied
lea
into
the
jacket
he
had
been
wearing
slung
like
a
pack
on
his
back
it
made
the
walking
easier
the
gravel
gave
way
to
sliding
dunes
of
sand
that
seemed
to
continue
to
infinity
it
was
a
painful
slipping
climb
to
the
top
of
each
one
then
an
equally
difficult
descent
to
the
hollow
at
the
foot
of
the
next
with
the
first
lightening
of
the
sky
in
the
east
he
stopped
breath
rasping
in
his
chest
to
mark
his
direction
before
the
stars
faded
one
line
scratched
in
the
sand
pointed
due
north
a
second
pointed
out
the
course
they
should
follow
when
they
were
aligned
to
his
satisfaction
he
washed
his
mouth
out
with
a
single
swallow
of
water
and
sat
on
the
sand
next
to
the
still
form
of
the
girl
gold
fingers
of
fire
searched
across
the
sky
wiping
out
the
stars
it
was
magnificent
brion
forgot
his
fatigue
in
appreciation
there
should
be
some
way
of
preserving
it
a
quatrain
would
be
best
short
enough
to
be
remembered
yet
requiring
attention
and
skill
to
compact
everything
into
it
he
had
scored
high
with
his
quatrains
in
the
twenties
this
would
be
a
special
one
taind
his
poetry
mentor
would
have
to
get
a
copy
what
are
you
mumbling
about
lea
asked
looking
up
at
the
craggy
blackness
of
his
profile
against
the
reddening
sky
poem
he
said
shhh
just
a
minute
it
was
too
much
for
lea
coming
after
the
tension
and
dangers
of
the
night
she
began
to
laugh
laughing
even
harder
when
he
scowled
at
her
only
when
she
heard
the
tinge
of
growing
hysteria
did
she
make
an
attempt
to
break
off
the
laughter
the
sun
cleared
the
horizon
washing
a
sudden
warmth
over
them
lea
gasped
your
throat
been
cut
you
bleeding
to
death
not
really
he
said
touching
his
fingertips
lightly
against
the
wound
that
circled
his
neck
just
superficial
depression
sat
on
him
as
he
suddenly
remembered
the
battle
and
death
of
the
previous
night
lea
did
notice
his
face
she
was
busy
digging
in
the
pack
he
had
thrown
down
he
had
to
use
his
fingers
to
massage
and
force
away
the
grimace
of
pain
that
twisted
his
mouth
memory
was
more
painful
than
the
wound
how
easily
he
had
killed
three
men
how
close
to
the
surface
of
the
civilized
man
the
animal
dwelled
in
countless
matches
he
had
used
those
holds
always
drawing
back
from
the
exertion
of
the
full
killing
power
they
were
part
of
a
game
part
of
the
twenties
yet
when
his
friend
had
been
killed
he
had
become
a
killer
himself
he
believed
in
nonviolence
and
the
sanctity
of
life
until
the
first
test
when
he
had
killed
without
hesitation
more
ironic
was
the
fact
he
really
felt
no
guilt
even
now
shock
at
the
change
yes
but
no
more
than
that
lift
your
chin
lea
said
brandishing
the
antiseptic
applicator
she
had
found
in
the
medicine
kit
he
lifted
his
chin
obligingly
and
the
liquid
drew
a
cool
burning
line
across
his
neck
antibio
pills
would
do
a
lot
more
good
since
the
wound
was
completely
clotted
by
now
but
he
did
speak
his
thoughts
aloud
for
the
moment
lea
had
forgotten
herself
in
taking
care
of
him
he
put
some
of
the
antiseptic
on
her
scalp
bruise
and
she
squeaked
pulling
back
they
both
swallowed
the
pills
that
sun
is
hot
already
lea
said
peeling
off
her
heavy
clothing
let
find
a
nice
cool
cave
or
an
saloon
to
crawl
into
for
the
day
i
do
think
there
are
any
here
just
sand
we
have
to
walk
i
know
we
have
to
walk
she
interrupted
there
no
need
for
a
lecture
about
it
you
as
seriously
cubical
as
the
bank
of
terra
relax
count
ten
and
start
again
lea
was
making
empty
talk
while
she
listened
to
the
memory
of
hysteria
tittering
at
the
fringes
of
her
brain
no
time
for
that
we
have
to
keep
going
brion
climbed
slowly
to
his
feet
after
stowing
everything
in
the
pack
when
he
sighted
along
his
marker
at
the
western
horizon
he
saw
nothing
to
mark
their
course
only
the
marching
dunes
he
helped
lea
to
her
feet
and
began
walking
slowly
towards
them
just
hold
on
a
second
lea
called
after
him
where
do
you
think
you
going
in
that
direction
he
said
pointing
i
hoped
there
would
be
some
landmarks
but
there
are
we
have
to
keep
on
by
dead
reckoning
the
sun
will
keep
us
pretty
well
on
course
if
we
there
by
night
the
stars
will
be
a
better
guide
all
this
on
an
empty
stomach
how
about
breakfast
i
hungry
and
thirsty
no
food
he
shook
the
canteen
that
gurgled
emptily
it
had
been
only
partly
filled
when
he
found
it
the
water
low
and
we
need
it
later
i
need
it
now
she
said
shortly
my
mouth
tastes
like
an
unemptied
ashtray
and
i
dry
as
paper
just
a
single
swallow
he
said
after
the
briefest
hesitation
this
is
all
we
have
lea
sipped
at
it
with
her
eyes
closed
in
appreciation
then
he
sealed
the
top
and
returned
it
to
the
pack
without
taking
any
himself
they
were
sweating
as
they
started
up
the
first
dune
the
desert
was
barren
of
life
they
were
the
only
things
moving
under
that
merciless
sun
their
shadows
pointed
the
way
ahead
of
them
and
as
the
shadows
shortened
the
heat
rose
it
had
an
intensity
lea
had
never
experienced
before
a
physical
weight
that
pushed
at
her
with
a
searing
hand
her
clothing
was
sodden
with
perspiration
and
it
trickled
burning
into
her
eyes
the
light
and
heat
made
it
hard
to
see
and
she
leaned
on
the
immovable
strength
of
brion
arm
he
walked
on
steadily
apparently
ignoring
the
heat
and
discomfort
i
wonder
if
those
things
are
edible
or
store
water
brion
voice
was
a
harsh
rasp
lea
blinked
and
squinted
at
the
leathery
shape
on
the
summit
of
the
dune
plant
or
animal
it
was
hard
to
tell
it
was
the
size
of
a
man
head
wrinkled
and
grey
as
leather
knobbed
with
thick
spikes
brion
pushed
it
up
with
his
toe
and
they
had
a
brief
glimpse
of
a
white
roundness
like
a
shiny
taproot
going
down
into
the
dune
then
the
thing
contracted
pulling
itself
lower
into
the
sand
at
the
same
instant
something
thin
and
sharp
lashed
out
through
a
fold
in
the
skin
striking
at
brion
boot
and
withdrawing
there
was
a
scratch
on
the
hard
plastic
beaded
with
drops
of
green
liquid
probably
poison
he
said
digging
his
toe
into
the
sand
this
thing
is
too
mean
to
fool
with
without
a
good
reason
let
keep
going
it
was
before
noon
when
lea
fell
down
she
really
wanted
to
go
on
but
her
body
would
obey
the
thin
soles
of
her
shoes
were
no
protection
against
the
burning
sand
and
her
feet
were
lumps
of
raw
pain
heat
hammered
down
poured
up
from
the
sand
and
swirled
her
in
an
oven
of
pain
the
air
she
gasped
in
was
molten
metal
that
dried
and
cracked
her
mouth
each
pulse
of
her
heart
throbbed
blood
to
the
wound
in
her
scalp
until
it
seemed
her
skull
would
burst
with
the
agony
she
had
stripped
down
to
the
short
tunic
in
spite
of
insistence
that
she
keep
her
body
protected
from
the
sun
and
that
clung
to
her
soaked
with
sweat
she
tore
at
it
in
a
desperate
effort
to
breathe
there
was
no
escape
from
the
unending
heat
though
the
baked
sand
burned
torture
into
her
knees
and
hands
she
could
rise
it
took
all
her
strength
not
to
fall
further
her
eyes
closed
and
everything
swirled
in
immense
circles
brion
blinking
through
slitted
eyes
saw
her
go
down
he
lifted
her
and
carried
her
again
as
he
had
the
night
before
the
hot
touch
of
her
body
shocked
his
bare
arms
her
skin
was
flushed
pink
the
tunic
was
torn
open
and
one
pointed
breast
rose
and
fell
unevenly
with
the
irregularity
of
her
breathing
wiping
his
palm
free
of
sweat
and
sand
he
touched
her
skin
and
felt
the
ominous
hot
dryness
all
the
symptoms
dry
flushed
skin
the
ragged
breathing
her
temperature
rising
quickly
as
her
body
stopped
fighting
the
heat
and
succumbed
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
here
to
protect
her
from
the
heat
he
measured
a
tiny
portion
of
the
remaining
water
into
her
mouth
and
she
swallowed
convulsively
her
thin
clothing
was
little
protection
from
the
sun
he
could
only
take
her
in
his
arms
and
keep
on
towards
the
horizon
an
outcropping
of
rock
threw
a
tiny
patch
of
shade
and
he
walked
towards
it
the
ground
here
shielded
from
the
direct
rays
of
the
sun
felt
almost
cool
by
contrast
lea
opened
her
eyes
when
he
put
her
down
peering
up
at
him
through
a
haze
of
pain
she
wanted
to
apologize
to
him
for
her
weakness
but
no
words
came
from
the
dried
membrane
of
her
throat
his
body
above
her
seemed
to
swim
back
and
forth
in
the
heat
waves
swaying
like
a
tree
in
a
high
wind
shock
drove
her
eyes
open
cleared
her
mind
for
an
instant
he
really
was
swaying
suddenly
she
realized
how
much
she
had
come
to
depend
on
the
unending
solidity
of
his
strength
and
now
it
was
failing
all
over
his
body
the
corded
muscles
contracted
in
ridges
striving
to
keep
him
erect
she
saw
his
mouth
pulled
open
by
the
taut
cords
of
his
neck
and
the
gaping
silent
scream
was
more
terrible
than
any
sound
then
she
herself
screamed
as
his
eyes
rolled
back
leaving
only
the
empty
white
of
the
eyeballs
staring
terribly
at
her
he
went
over
back
down
like
a
felled
tree
thudding
heavily
on
the
sand
unconscious
or
dead
she
tell
she
pulled
limply
at
his
leg
but
could
drag
his
immense
weight
into
the
shade
brion
lay
on
his
back
in
the
sun
sweating
lea
saw
this
and
knew
that
he
was
still
alive
yet
what
was
happening
she
groped
for
memory
in
the
red
haze
of
her
mind
but
could
remember
nothing
from
her
medical
studies
that
would
explain
this
on
every
square
inch
of
his
body
the
sweat
glands
seethed
with
sudden
activity
from
every
pore
oozed
great
globules
of
oily
liquid
far
thicker
than
normal
perspiration
brion
arms
rippled
with
motion
and
lea
gaped
horrified
as
the
hairs
there
writhed
and
stirred
as
though
endowed
with
separate
life
his
chest
rose
and
fell
rapidly
deep
gasping
breaths
racking
his
body
lea
could
only
stare
through
the
dim
redness
of
unreality
and
wonder
if
she
was
going
mad
before
she
died
a
coughing
fit
broke
the
rhythm
of
his
rasping
breath
and
when
it
was
over
his
breathing
was
easier
the
perspiration
still
covered
his
body
the
individual
beads
touching
and
forming
tiny
streams
that
trickled
down
his
body
and
vanished
in
the
sand
he
stirred
and
rolled
onto
his
side
facing
her
his
eyes
were
open
and
normal
now
as
he
smiled
did
mean
to
frighten
you
it
caught
me
suddenly
coming
at
the
wrong
season
and
everything
it
was
a
bit
of
a
jar
to
my
system
i
get
you
some
water
now
there
still
a
bit
left
what
happened
when
you
looked
like
that
when
you
fell
take
two
swallows
no
more
he
said
holding
the
open
canteen
to
her
mouth
just
summer
change
that
all
it
happens
to
us
every
year
on
anvhar
only
not
that
violently
of
course
in
the
winter
our
bodies
store
a
layer
of
fat
under
the
skin
for
insulation
and
sweating
almost
ceases
completely
there
are
a
lot
of
internal
changes
too
when
the
weather
warms
up
the
process
is
reversed
the
fat
is
metabolized
and
the
sweat
glands
enlarge
and
begin
working
overtime
as
the
body
prepares
for
two
months
of
hard
work
heat
and
little
sleep
i
guess
the
heat
here
triggered
off
the
summer
change
early
you
mean
you
adapted
to
this
terrible
planet
just
about
though
it
does
feel
a
little
warm
i
need
a
lot
more
water
soon
so
we
ca
remain
here
do
you
think
you
can
stand
the
sun
if
i
carry
you
no
but
i
wo
feel
any
better
staying
here
she
was
scarcely
aware
of
what
she
said
keep
going
i
guess
keep
going
as
soon
as
she
was
out
of
the
shadow
of
the
rock
the
sunlight
burst
over
her
again
in
a
wave
of
hot
pain
she
fell
unconscious
at
once
brion
picked
her
up
and
staggered
forward
after
a
few
yards
he
began
to
feel
the
pull
of
the
sand
he
knew
he
was
reaching
the
end
of
his
strength
he
went
more
slowly
and
each
dune
seemed
a
bit
higher
than
the
one
before
giant
rocks
pushed
through
the
dunes
here
and
he
had
to
stumble
around
them
at
the
base
of
the
largest
of
these
monoliths
was
a
straggling
clump
of
knotted
vegetation
he
passed
it
by
then
stopped
as
something
tried
to
penetrate
his
mind
what
was
it
a
difference
something
about
these
plants
that
he
had
noticed
in
any
of
the
others
he
had
passed
during
the
day
it
was
almost
like
defeat
to
turn
and
push
his
clumsy
feet
backwards
in
his
own
footprints
to
stand
blinking
helplessly
at
the
plants
yet
they
were
important
some
of
them
had
been
cut
off
close
to
the
sand
not
broken
by
any
natural
cause
but
cut
sharply
and
squarely
by
a
knife
or
blade
of
some
sort
the
cut
plants
were
long
dried
and
dead
but
a
tiny
hope
flared
up
in
him
this
was
the
first
sign
that
other
people
were
actually
alive
on
this
planet
and
whatever
the
plants
had
been
cut
for
they
might
be
of
aid
to
him
food
perhaps
drink
his
hands
trembled
at
the
thought
as
he
dropped
lea
heavily
into
the
shade
of
the
rock
she
did
stir
his
knife
was
sharp
but
most
of
the
strength
was
gone
from
his
hands
breath
rasping
in
his
dried
throat
he
sawed
at
the
tough
stem
finally
cutting
it
through
raising
up
the
shrub
he
saw
a
thick
liquid
dripping
from
the
severed
end
he
braced
his
hand
against
his
leg
so
it
would
shake
and
spill
until
his
cupped
palm
was
full
of
sap
it
was
wet
even
a
little
cool
as
it
evaporated
surely
it
was
mostly
water
he
had
a
moment
misgiving
as
he
raised
it
to
his
lips
and
instead
of
drinking
it
merely
touched
it
with
the
tip
of
his
tongue
at
first
nothing
then
a
searing
pain
it
stabbed
deep
into
his
throat
and
choked
him
his
stomach
heaved
and
he
vomited
bitter
bile
on
his
knees
fighting
the
waves
of
pain
he
lost
body
fluid
he
vitally
needed
despair
was
worse
than
the
pain
the
plant
juice
must
have
some
use
there
must
be
a
way
of
purifying
it
or
neutralizing
it
but
brion
a
stranger
on
this
planet
would
be
dead
long
before
he
found
out
how
to
do
this
weakened
by
the
cramps
that
still
tore
at
him
he
tried
not
to
realize
how
close
to
the
end
he
was
getting
the
girl
on
his
back
seemed
an
impossible
task
and
for
an
instant
he
was
tempted
to
leave
her
there
yet
even
as
he
considered
this
he
shouldered
her
leaden
weight
and
once
more
went
on
each
footstep
an
effort
he
followed
his
own
track
up
the
dune
painfully
he
forced
his
way
to
the
top
and
looked
at
the
disan
standing
a
few
feet
away
they
were
both
too
surprised
by
the
sudden
encounter
to
react
at
once
for
a
breath
of
time
they
stared
at
each
other
unmoving
when
they
reacted
it
was
the
same
defense
of
fear
brion
dropped
the
girl
bringing
the
gun
up
from
the
holster
in
the
return
of
the
same
motion
the
disan
jerked
a
belled
tube
from
his
waistband
and
raised
it
to
his
mouth
brion
did
fire
a
dead
man
had
taught
him
how
to
train
his
empathetic
sense
and
to
trust
it
in
spite
of
the
fear
that
wanted
him
to
jerk
the
trigger
a
different
sense
read
the
unvoiced
emotions
of
the
native
disan
there
was
fear
there
and
hatred
welling
up
around
these
was
a
strong
desire
not
to
commit
violence
this
time
to
communicate
instead
brion
felt
and
recognized
all
this
in
a
fraction
of
a
second
he
had
to
act
instantly
to
avoid
a
tragic
happening
a
jerk
of
his
wrist
threw
the
gun
to
one
side
as
soon
as
it
was
gone
he
regretted
its
loss
he
was
gambling
their
lives
on
an
ability
he
still
was
not
sure
of
the
disan
had
the
tube
to
his
mouth
when
the
gun
hit
the
ground
he
held
the
pose
unmoving
thinking
then
he
accepted
brion
action
and
thrust
the
tube
back
into
his
waistband
do
you
have
any
water
brion
asked
the
guttural
disan
words
hurting
his
throat
i
have
water
the
man
said
he
still
did
move
who
are
you
what
are
you
doing
here
we
from
offplanet
we
had
an
accident
we
want
to
go
to
the
city
the
water
the
disan
looked
at
the
unconscious
girl
and
made
his
decision
over
one
shoulder
he
wore
one
of
the
green
objects
that
brion
remembered
from
the
solido
he
pulled
it
off
and
the
thing
writhed
slowly
in
his
hands
it
was
alive
a
green
length
a
metre
long
like
a
noduled
section
of
a
thick
vine
one
end
flared
out
into
a
formation
the
disan
took
a
object
from
his
waist
and
thrust
it
into
the
petaled
orifice
when
he
turned
the
hook
in
a
quick
motion
the
length
of
green
writhed
and
curled
around
his
arm
he
pulled
something
small
and
dark
out
and
threw
it
to
the
ground
extending
the
twisting
green
shape
towards
brion
put
your
mouth
to
the
end
and
drink
he
said
lea
needed
the
water
more
but
he
drank
first
suspicious
of
the
living
water
source
a
hollow
below
the
writhing
petals
was
filling
with
water
from
the
fibrous
reedy
interior
he
raised
it
to
his
mouth
and
drank
the
water
was
hot
and
tasted
swampy
sudden
sharp
pains
around
his
mouth
made
him
jerk
the
thing
away
tiny
glistening
white
barbs
projected
from
the
petals
now
with
his
blood
brion
swung
towards
the
disan
angrily
and
stopped
when
he
looked
at
the
other
man
face
his
mouth
was
surrounded
by
many
small
white
scars
the
does
not
like
to
give
up
its
water
but
it
always
does
the
man
said
brion
drank
again
then
put
the
vaede
to
lea
mouth
she
moaned
without
regaining
consciousness
her
lips
seeking
reflexively
for
the
liquid
when
she
was
satisfied
brion
gently
drew
the
barbs
from
her
flesh
and
drank
again
the
disan
hunkered
down
on
his
heels
and
watched
them
expressionlessly
brion
handed
back
the
vaede
then
held
some
of
the
clothes
so
that
lea
was
in
their
shade
he
settled
to
the
same
position
as
the
native
and
looked
closely
at
him
squatting
immobile
on
his
heels
the
disan
appeared
perfectly
comfortable
under
the
flaming
sun
there
was
no
trace
of
perspiration
on
his
naked
browned
skin
long
hair
fell
to
his
shoulders
and
startlingly
blue
eyes
stared
back
at
brion
from
deepset
sockets
the
heavy
kilt
around
his
loins
was
the
only
garment
he
wore
once
more
the
vaede
rested
over
his
shoulder
still
stirring
unhappily
around
his
waist
was
the
same
collection
of
leather
stone
and
brass
objects
that
had
been
in
the
solido
two
of
them
now
had
meaning
to
brion
the
a
blowgun
of
some
kind
and
the
specially
shaped
hook
for
opening
the
vaede
he
wondered
if
the
other
strangely
formed
things
had
equally
practical
functions
if
you
accepted
them
as
artifacts
with
a
purpose
not
barbaric
decorations
you
had
to
accept
their
owner
as
something
more
than
the
crude
savage
he
resembled
my
name
is
brion
and
you
you
may
not
have
my
name
why
are
you
here
to
kill
my
people
brion
forced
away
the
memory
of
last
night
killing
was
just
what
he
had
done
some
expectancy
in
the
man
manner
some
sensed
feeling
of
hope
prompted
brion
to
speak
the
truth
i
here
to
stop
your
people
from
being
killed
i
believe
in
the
end
of
the
war
prove
it
take
me
to
the
cultural
relationships
foundations
in
the
city
and
i
prove
it
i
can
do
nothing
here
in
the
desert
except
die
for
the
first
time
there
was
emotion
on
the
disan
face
he
frowned
and
muttered
something
to
himself
there
was
a
fine
beading
of
sweat
above
his
eyebrows
now
as
he
fought
an
internal
battle
coming
to
a
decision
he
rose
and
brion
stood
too
come
with
me
i
take
you
to
hovedstad
but
first
you
will
tell
me
are
you
from
nyjord
no
the
nameless
disan
merely
grunted
and
turned
away
brion
shouldered
lea
unconscious
body
and
followed
him
they
walked
for
two
hours
the
disan
setting
a
cruel
pace
before
they
reached
a
wasteland
of
jumbled
rock
the
native
pointed
to
the
highest
tower
of
stone
wait
near
this
he
said
someone
will
come
for
you
he
watched
while
brion
placed
the
girl
still
body
in
the
shade
and
passed
over
the
vaede
for
the
last
time
just
before
leaving
he
turned
back
hesitating
my
name
is
ulv
he
said
then
he
was
gone
brion
did
what
he
could
to
make
lea
comfortable
but
it
was
very
little
if
she
did
get
medical
attention
soon
she
would
be
dead
dehydration
and
shock
were
uniting
to
destroy
her
just
before
sunset
he
heard
clanking
and
the
throbbing
whine
of
a
sand
car
engine
coming
from
the
west
viii
with
each
second
the
noise
grew
louder
coming
their
way
the
tracks
squeaked
as
the
car
turned
around
the
rock
spire
obviously
seeking
them
out
a
large
carrier
big
as
a
truck
it
stopped
before
them
in
a
cloud
of
its
own
dust
and
the
driver
kicked
the
door
open
get
in
here
and
fast
the
man
shouted
you
letting
in
all
the
heat
he
gunned
the
engine
ready
to
kick
in
the
gears
and
looked
at
them
irritatedly
ignoring
the
driver
nervous
instructions
brion
carefully
placed
lea
on
the
rear
seat
before
he
pulled
the
door
shut
the
car
surged
forward
instantly
a
blast
of
icy
air
pouring
from
the
vents
it
was
cold
in
the
vehicle
but
the
temperature
was
at
least
forty
degrees
lower
than
the
outer
air
brion
covered
lea
with
all
their
extra
clothing
to
prevent
any
further
shock
to
her
system
the
driver
hunched
over
the
wheel
and
driving
with
an
intense
speed
had
said
a
word
to
them
since
they
had
entered
brion
looked
up
as
another
man
stepped
from
the
engine
compartment
in
the
rear
of
the
car
he
was
thin
and
he
was
pointing
a
gun
who
are
you
he
said
without
a
trace
of
warmth
in
his
voice
it
was
a
strange
reception
but
brion
was
beginning
to
realize
that
dis
was
a
strange
planet
the
other
man
chewed
at
his
lip
nervously
while
brion
sat
relaxed
and
unmoving
he
did
want
to
startle
him
into
pulling
the
trigger
and
he
kept
his
voice
pitched
low
as
he
answered
my
name
is
brandd
we
landed
from
space
two
nights
ago
and
have
been
walking
in
the
desert
ever
since
now
do
get
excited
and
shoot
the
gun
when
i
tell
you
this
but
both
vion
and
ihjel
are
dead
the
man
with
the
gun
gasped
his
eyes
widened
the
driver
threw
a
single
frightened
look
over
his
shoulder
then
turned
quickly
back
to
the
wheel
brion
probe
had
hit
its
mark
if
these
men
from
the
cultural
relationships
foundation
they
at
least
knew
a
lot
about
it
it
seemed
safe
to
assume
they
were
men
when
they
were
shot
the
girl
and
i
escaped
we
were
trying
to
reach
the
city
and
contact
you
you
are
from
the
foundation
are
you
yes
of
course
the
man
said
lowering
the
gun
he
stared
into
space
for
a
moment
nervously
working
his
teeth
against
his
lip
startled
at
his
own
inattention
he
raised
the
gun
again
if
you
brandd
there
something
i
want
to
know
rummaging
in
his
breast
pocket
with
his
free
hand
he
brought
out
a
yellow
message
form
he
moved
his
lips
as
he
reread
the
message
now
answer
me
if
you
can
what
are
the
last
three
events
in
the
he
took
a
quick
look
at
the
paper
again
in
the
twenties
chess
finals
rifle
prone
position
and
fencing
playoffs
why
the
man
grunted
and
slid
the
pistol
back
into
its
holder
satisfied
i
faussel
he
said
and
waved
the
message
at
brion
this
is
ihjel
last
will
and
testament
relayed
to
us
by
the
nyjord
blockade
control
he
thought
he
was
going
to
die
and
he
sure
was
right
passed
on
his
job
to
you
you
in
charge
i
was
until
he
was
poisoned
i
was
supposed
to
work
for
ihjel
and
now
i
guess
i
yours
at
least
until
tomorrow
when
we
have
everything
packed
and
get
off
this
hell
planet
what
do
you
mean
tomorrow
brion
asked
it
three
days
to
deadline
and
we
still
have
a
job
to
do
faussel
had
dropped
heavily
into
one
of
the
seats
and
he
sprang
to
his
feet
again
clutching
the
seat
back
to
keep
his
balance
in
the
swaying
car
three
days
three
weeks
three
minutes
what
difference
does
it
make
his
voice
rose
shrilly
with
each
word
and
he
had
to
make
a
definite
effort
to
master
himself
before
he
could
go
on
look
you
do
know
anything
about
this
you
just
arrived
and
that
your
bad
luck
my
bad
luck
is
being
assigned
to
this
death
trap
and
watching
the
depraved
and
filthy
things
the
natives
do
and
trying
to
be
polite
to
them
even
when
they
are
killing
my
friends
and
those
nyjord
bombers
up
there
with
their
hands
on
the
triggers
one
of
those
bombardiers
is
going
to
start
thinking
about
home
and
about
the
cobalt
bombs
down
here
and
he
going
to
press
that
button
deadline
or
no
deadline
sit
down
faussel
sit
down
and
take
a
rest
there
was
sympathy
in
brion
voice
but
also
the
firmness
of
an
order
faussel
swayed
for
a
second
longer
then
collapsed
he
sat
with
his
cheek
against
the
window
eyes
closed
a
pulse
throbbed
visibly
in
his
temple
and
his
lips
worked
he
had
been
under
too
much
tension
for
too
long
a
time
this
was
the
atmosphere
that
hung
heavily
in
the
air
at
the
building
when
they
arrived
despair
and
defeat
the
doctor
was
the
only
one
who
did
share
this
mood
as
he
bustled
lea
off
to
the
clinic
with
prompt
efficiency
he
obviously
had
enough
patients
to
keep
his
mind
occupied
with
the
others
the
feeling
of
depression
was
unmistakable
from
the
instant
they
had
driven
through
the
automatic
garage
door
brion
had
swum
in
this
miasma
of
defeat
it
was
omnipresent
and
hard
to
ignore
as
soon
as
he
had
eaten
he
went
with
faussel
into
what
was
to
have
been
ihjel
office
through
the
transparent
walls
he
could
see
the
staff
packing
the
records
crating
them
for
shipment
faussel
seemed
less
nervous
now
that
he
was
no
longer
in
command
brion
rejected
any
idea
he
had
of
letting
the
man
know
that
he
himself
was
only
a
novice
in
the
foundation
he
was
going
to
need
all
the
authority
he
could
muster
since
they
would
undoubtedly
hate
him
for
what
he
was
going
to
do
better
take
notes
of
this
faussel
and
have
it
typed
i
sign
it
the
printed
word
always
carried
more
weight
all
preparations
for
leaving
are
to
be
stopped
at
once
records
are
to
be
returned
to
the
files
we
are
going
to
stay
here
just
as
long
as
we
have
clearance
from
the
nyjorders
if
this
operation
is
unsuccessful
we
will
all
leave
together
when
the
time
expires
we
will
take
whatever
personal
baggage
we
can
carry
by
hand
everything
else
stays
here
perhaps
you
do
realize
we
are
here
to
save
a
planet
not
file
cabinets
full
of
papers
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eye
he
saw
faussel
flush
with
anger
as
soon
as
that
is
typed
bring
it
back
and
all
the
reports
as
to
what
has
been
accomplished
on
this
project
that
will
be
all
for
now
faussel
stamped
out
and
a
minute
later
brion
saw
the
shocked
angry
looks
from
the
workers
in
the
outer
office
turning
his
back
to
them
he
opened
the
drawers
in
the
desk
one
after
another
the
top
drawer
was
empty
except
for
a
sealed
envelope
it
was
addressed
to
winner
ihjel
brion
looked
at
it
thoughtfully
then
ripped
it
open
the
letter
inside
was
handwritten
had
the
official
word
that
you
are
on
the
way
to
relieve
me
and
i
am
forced
to
admit
i
feel
only
an
intense
satisfaction
you
had
the
experience
on
these
outlaw
planets
and
can
get
along
with
the
odd
types
i
have
been
specializing
in
research
for
the
last
twenty
years
and
the
only
reason
i
was
appointed
planetary
supervisor
on
nyjord
was
because
of
the
observation
and
application
facilities
i
the
research
type
not
the
office
type
no
one
has
ever
denied
going
to
have
trouble
with
the
staff
so
you
had
better
realize
that
they
are
all
compulsory
volunteers
half
are
clerical
people
from
my
staff
the
others
a
mixed
bag
of
whoever
was
close
enough
to
be
pulled
in
on
this
crash
assignment
it
developed
so
fast
we
never
saw
it
coming
and
i
afraid
we
done
little
or
nothing
to
stop
it
we
ca
get
access
to
the
natives
here
not
in
the
slightest
frightening
they
do
fit
i
done
poisson
distributions
on
a
dozen
different
factors
and
none
of
them
can
be
equated
the
pareto
extrapolations
work
our
field
men
ca
even
talk
to
the
natives
and
two
have
been
killed
trying
the
ruling
class
is
unapproachable
and
the
rest
just
keep
their
mouths
shut
and
walk
going
to
take
a
chance
and
try
to
talk
to
perhaps
i
can
make
him
see
sense
i
doubt
if
it
will
work
and
there
is
a
chance
he
will
try
violence
with
me
the
nobility
here
are
very
prone
to
violence
if
i
get
back
all
right
you
wo
see
this
note
otherwise
ihjel
try
to
do
a
better
job
than
i
there
is
a
problem
with
the
staff
they
are
supposed
to
be
saviors
but
without
exception
they
all
loathe
the
disans
i
afraid
i
do
brion
ticked
off
the
relevant
points
in
the
letter
he
had
to
find
some
way
of
discovering
what
pareto
extrapolations
were
without
uncovering
his
own
lack
of
knowledge
the
staff
would
vanish
in
five
minutes
if
they
knew
how
new
he
was
at
the
job
poisson
distribution
made
more
sense
it
was
used
in
physics
as
the
unchanging
probability
of
an
event
that
would
be
true
at
all
times
such
as
the
numbers
of
particles
that
would
be
given
off
by
a
lump
of
radioactive
matter
during
a
short
period
from
the
way
mervv
used
it
in
his
letter
it
looked
as
if
the
societics
people
had
found
measurable
applications
in
societies
and
groups
at
least
on
other
planets
none
of
the
rules
seemed
to
be
working
on
dis
ihjel
had
admitted
that
and
mervv
death
had
proven
it
brion
wondered
who
this
was
who
appeared
to
have
killed
mervv
a
forged
cough
broke
through
brion
concentration
and
he
realized
that
faussel
had
been
standing
in
front
of
his
desk
for
some
minutes
brion
looked
up
and
mopped
perspiration
from
his
face
your
air
conditioner
seems
to
be
out
of
order
faussel
said
should
i
have
the
mechanic
look
at
it
there
nothing
wrong
with
the
machine
i
just
adapting
to
climate
what
else
do
you
want
faussel
the
assistant
had
a
doubting
look
that
he
did
succeed
in
hiding
he
also
had
trouble
believing
the
literal
truth
he
placed
the
small
stack
of
file
folders
on
the
desk
these
are
the
reports
to
date
everything
we
have
uncovered
about
the
disans
it
not
very
much
but
considering
the
attitudes
on
this
lousy
world
it
is
the
best
we
could
do
a
sudden
thought
hit
him
and
his
eyes
narrowed
slyly
it
ca
be
helped
but
some
of
the
staff
have
been
wondering
out
loud
about
that
native
that
contacted
us
how
did
you
get
him
to
help
you
we
never
gotten
to
first
base
with
these
people
and
as
soon
as
you
land
you
have
one
working
for
you
you
ca
stop
people
from
thinking
about
it
you
being
a
newcomer
and
a
stranger
after
all
it
looks
a
little
odd
he
broke
off
in
midsentence
as
brion
looked
at
him
in
cold
fury
i
ca
stop
people
from
thinking
about
it
but
i
can
stop
them
from
talking
our
job
is
to
contact
the
disans
and
stop
this
suicidal
war
i
have
done
more
in
one
day
than
you
all
have
done
since
you
arrived
i
have
accomplished
this
because
i
am
better
at
my
work
than
the
rest
of
you
that
is
all
the
information
any
of
you
are
going
to
receive
you
are
dismissed
white
with
anger
faussel
turned
on
his
heel
and
stamped
out
to
spread
the
word
about
what
a
the
new
director
was
they
would
then
all
hate
him
passionately
which
was
just
the
way
he
wanted
it
he
could
risk
exposure
as
the
tyro
he
was
and
perhaps
a
new
emotion
other
than
disgust
and
defeat
might
jar
them
into
a
little
action
they
certainly
could
do
any
worse
than
they
had
been
doing
it
was
a
tremendous
amount
of
responsibility
for
the
first
time
since
setting
foot
on
this
barbaric
planet
brion
had
time
to
stop
and
think
he
was
taking
an
awful
lot
upon
himself
he
knew
nothing
about
this
world
nor
about
the
powers
involved
in
the
conflict
here
he
sat
pretending
to
be
in
charge
of
an
organization
he
had
first
heard
about
only
a
few
weeks
earlier
it
was
a
frightening
situation
should
he
slide
out
from
under
there
was
just
one
possible
answer
and
that
was
until
he
found
someone
else
who
could
do
better
he
seemed
to
be
the
one
best
suited
for
the
job
and
ihjel
opinion
had
to
count
for
something
brion
had
felt
the
surety
of
the
man
conviction
that
brion
was
the
only
one
who
might
possibly
succeed
in
this
difficult
spot
let
it
go
at
that
if
he
had
any
qualms
it
would
be
best
to
put
them
behind
him
aside
from
everything
else
there
was
a
primary
bit
of
loyalty
involved
ihjel
had
been
an
anvharian
and
a
winner
maybe
it
was
a
provincial
attitude
to
hold
in
this
big
universe
anvhar
was
certainly
far
enough
away
from
here
but
honor
is
very
important
to
a
man
who
must
stand
alone
he
had
a
debt
to
ihjel
and
he
was
going
to
pay
it
off
once
the
decision
had
been
made
he
felt
easier
there
was
an
intercom
on
the
desk
in
front
of
him
and
he
leaned
with
a
heavy
thumb
on
the
button
labeled
yes
even
through
the
speaker
the
man
voice
was
cold
with
hatred
who
is
and
did
the
former
director
ever
return
from
seeing
him
magte
is
a
title
that
means
roughly
noble
or
lord
is
the
local
overlord
he
has
an
ugly
stoneheap
of
a
building
just
outside
the
city
he
seems
to
be
the
mouthpiece
for
the
group
of
magter
that
are
pushing
this
idiotic
war
as
to
your
second
question
i
have
to
answer
yes
and
no
we
found
director
mervv
head
outside
the
door
next
morning
with
all
the
skin
gone
we
knew
who
it
was
because
the
doctor
identified
the
bridgework
in
his
mouth
you
understand
all
pretense
of
control
had
vanished
and
faussel
almost
shrieked
the
last
words
they
were
all
close
to
cracking
up
if
he
was
any
example
brion
broke
in
quickly
that
will
be
all
faussel
just
get
word
to
the
doctor
that
i
would
like
to
see
him
as
soon
as
i
can
he
broke
the
connection
and
opened
the
first
of
the
folders
by
the
time
the
doctor
called
he
had
skimmed
the
reports
and
was
reading
the
relevant
ones
in
greater
detail
putting
on
his
warm
coat
he
went
through
the
outer
office
the
few
workers
still
on
duty
turned
their
backs
in
frigid
silence
doctor
stine
had
a
pink
and
shiny
bald
head
that
rose
above
a
thick
black
beard
brion
had
liked
him
at
once
anyone
with
enough
firmness
of
mind
to
keep
a
beard
in
this
climate
was
a
pleasant
exception
after
what
he
had
met
so
far
how
the
new
patient
doctor
stine
combed
his
beard
with
stubby
fingers
before
answering
diagnosis
prognosis
complete
recovery
condition
fair
considering
the
dehydration
and
extensive
sunburn
treated
the
burns
and
a
saline
drip
is
taking
care
of
the
other
she
just
missed
going
into
i
have
her
under
sedation
now
i
like
to
have
her
up
and
helping
me
tomorrow
morning
could
she
do
this
with
stimulants
or
drugs
she
could
but
i
do
like
it
there
might
be
side
factors
perhaps
debilitation
it
a
chance
a
chance
we
will
have
to
take
in
less
than
seventy
hours
this
planet
is
due
for
destruction
in
attempting
to
avert
that
tragedy
i
expendable
as
is
everyone
else
here
agreed
the
doctor
grunted
deep
in
his
beard
and
looked
brion
immense
frame
up
and
down
agreed
he
said
almost
happily
it
is
a
distinct
pleasure
to
see
something
beside
black
defeat
around
here
i
go
along
with
you
well
you
can
help
me
right
now
i
checked
the
personnel
roster
and
discovered
that
out
of
the
people
working
here
there
is
a
physical
scientist
of
any
kind
other
than
yourself
a
scruffy
bunch
of
and
theoreticians
not
worth
a
damn
for
field
work
the
whole
bunch
of
them
the
doctor
toed
the
floor
switch
on
a
waste
receptacle
and
spat
into
it
with
feeling
then
i
going
to
depend
on
you
for
some
straight
answers
brion
said
this
is
an
operation
and
the
standard
techniques
just
do
begin
to
make
sense
even
poisson
distributions
and
pareto
extrapolations
do
apply
here
stine
nodded
agreement
and
brion
relaxed
a
bit
he
had
just
relieved
himself
of
his
entire
knowledge
of
societics
and
it
had
sounded
authentic
the
more
i
look
at
it
the
more
i
believe
that
this
is
a
physical
problem
something
to
do
with
the
exotic
and
massive
adjustments
the
disans
have
made
to
this
hellish
environment
could
this
tie
up
in
any
way
with
their
absolutely
suicidal
attitude
towards
the
cobalt
bombs
could
it
could
it
stine
paced
the
floor
rapidly
on
his
stocky
legs
twining
his
fingers
behind
his
back
you
are
bloody
well
right
it
could
someone
is
thinking
at
last
and
not
just
punching
bloody
numbers
into
a
machine
and
sitting
and
scratching
his
behind
while
waiting
for
the
screen
to
light
up
with
the
answers
do
you
know
how
disans
exist
brion
shook
his
head
the
fools
here
think
it
disgusting
but
i
call
it
fascinating
they
have
found
ways
to
join
a
symbiotic
relationship
with
the
life
forms
on
this
planet
even
a
parasitic
relationship
you
must
realize
that
living
organisms
will
do
anything
to
survive
castaways
at
sea
will
drink
their
own
urine
in
their
need
for
water
disgust
at
this
is
only
the
attitude
of
the
overprotected
who
have
never
experienced
extreme
thirst
or
hunger
well
here
on
dis
you
have
a
planet
of
castaways
stine
opened
the
door
of
the
pharmacy
this
talk
of
thirst
makes
me
dry
with
economically
efficient
motions
he
poured
grain
alcohol
into
a
beaker
thinned
it
with
distilled
water
and
flavored
it
with
some
crystals
from
a
bottle
he
filled
two
glasses
and
handed
brion
one
it
did
taste
bad
at
all
what
do
you
mean
by
parasitic
doctor
are
we
all
parasites
of
the
lower
life
forms
meat
animals
vegetables
and
such
no
no
you
miss
the
point
i
speak
of
parasitic
in
the
exact
meaning
of
the
word
you
must
realize
that
to
a
biologist
there
is
no
real
difference
between
parasitism
symbiosis
mutualism
biontergasy
commensalism
stop
stop
brion
said
those
are
just
meaningless
sounds
to
me
if
that
is
what
makes
this
planet
tick
i
beginning
to
see
why
the
rest
of
the
staff
has
that
lost
feeling
it
is
just
a
matter
of
degree
of
the
same
thing
look
you
have
a
kind
of
crustacean
living
in
the
lakes
here
very
much
like
an
ordinary
crab
it
has
large
claws
in
which
it
holds
anemones
tentacled
sea
animals
with
no
power
of
motion
the
crustacean
waves
these
around
to
gather
food
and
eats
the
pieces
they
capture
that
are
too
big
for
them
this
is
biontergasy
two
creatures
living
and
working
together
yet
each
capable
of
existing
alone
now
this
same
crustacean
has
a
parasite
living
under
its
shell
a
degenerated
form
of
a
snail
that
has
lost
all
powers
of
movement
a
true
parasite
that
takes
food
from
its
host
body
and
gives
nothing
in
return
inside
this
snail
gut
there
is
a
protozoan
that
lives
off
the
snail
ingested
food
yet
this
little
organism
is
not
a
parasite
as
you
might
think
at
first
but
a
symbiote
it
takes
food
from
the
snail
but
at
the
same
time
it
secretes
a
chemical
that
aids
the
snail
digestion
of
the
food
do
you
get
the
picture
all
these
life
forms
exist
in
a
complicated
interdependence
brion
frowned
in
concentration
sipping
at
the
drink
it
making
some
kind
of
sense
now
symbiosis
parasitism
and
all
the
rest
are
just
ways
of
describing
variations
of
the
same
basic
process
of
living
together
and
there
is
probably
a
grading
and
shading
between
some
of
these
that
make
the
exact
relationship
hard
to
define
precisely
existence
is
so
difficult
on
this
world
that
the
competing
forms
have
almost
died
out
there
are
still
a
few
left
preying
off
the
others
it
was
the
cooperating
and
interdependent
life
forms
that
really
won
out
in
the
race
for
survival
i
say
life
forms
with
intent
the
creatures
here
are
mostly
a
mixture
of
plant
and
animal
like
the
lichens
you
have
elsewhere
the
disans
have
a
creature
they
call
a
vaede
that
they
use
for
water
when
traveling
it
has
rudimentary
powers
of
motion
from
its
animal
part
yet
uses
photosynthesis
and
stores
water
like
a
plant
when
the
disans
drink
from
it
the
thing
taps
their
blood
streams
for
food
elements
i
know
brion
said
wryly
i
drank
from
one
you
can
see
my
scars
i
beginning
to
comprehend
how
the
disans
fit
into
the
physical
pattern
of
their
world
and
i
realize
it
must
have
all
kinds
of
psychological
effects
on
them
do
you
think
this
has
any
effect
on
their
social
organization
an
important
one
but
maybe
i
making
too
many
suppositions
now
perhaps
your
researchers
upstairs
can
tell
you
better
after
all
this
is
their
field
brion
had
studied
the
reports
on
the
social
setup
and
not
one
word
of
them
made
sense
they
were
a
solid
maze
of
unknown
symbols
and
cryptic
charts
please
continue
doctor
he
insisted
the
societics
reports
are
valueless
so
far
there
are
factors
missing
you
are
the
only
one
i
have
talked
to
so
far
who
can
give
me
any
intelligent
reports
or
answers
all
right
then
be
it
on
your
own
head
the
way
i
see
it
got
no
society
here
at
all
just
a
bunch
of
rugged
individualists
each
one
for
himself
getting
nourishment
from
the
other
life
forms
of
the
planet
if
they
have
a
society
it
is
orientated
towards
the
rest
of
the
planetary
life
instead
of
towards
other
human
beings
perhaps
that
why
your
figures
do
make
sense
they
are
set
up
for
the
human
societies
in
their
relations
with
each
other
these
people
are
completely
different
what
about
the
magter
the
types
who
build
castles
and
are
causing
all
this
trouble
i
have
no
explanation
stine
admitted
my
theories
hold
water
and
seem
logical
enough
up
to
this
point
but
the
magter
are
the
exception
and
i
have
no
idea
why
they
are
completely
different
from
the
rest
of
the
disans
argumentative
looking
for
planetary
conquest
instead
of
peace
they
are
rulers
not
in
the
real
sense
they
hold
power
because
nobody
else
wants
it
they
grant
mining
concessions
to
offworlders
because
they
are
the
only
ones
with
a
sense
of
property
maybe
i
going
out
on
a
limb
but
if
you
can
find
out
they
are
so
different
you
may
be
onto
the
clue
to
our
difficulties
for
the
first
time
since
his
arrival
brion
began
to
feel
a
touch
of
enthusiasm
plus
a
sense
of
the
remote
possibility
that
there
might
even
be
a
solution
to
the
deadly
problem
he
drained
his
glass
and
stood
up
i
hope
you
wake
your
patient
early
doctor
you
might
be
as
interested
in
talking
to
her
as
i
am
if
what
you
told
me
is
true
she
could
well
be
our
key
to
the
answer
she
is
professor
lea
morees
and
she
is
just
out
from
earth
with
degrees
in
exobiology
and
anthropology
and
has
a
head
stuffed
with
vital
facts
wonderful
stine
said
i
shall
take
care
of
the
head
not
only
because
it
is
so
pretty
but
because
of
its
knowledge
though
we
totter
on
the
edge
of
atomic
destruction
i
have
a
strange
feeling
of
optimism
for
the
first
time
since
i
landed
on
this
planet
ix
the
guard
inside
the
front
entrance
of
the
foundation
building
jumped
at
the
thunderous
noise
and
reached
for
his
gun
he
dropped
his
hand
sheepishly
when
he
realized
it
was
only
a
sneeze
though
a
gargantuan
one
brion
came
up
sniffling
huddling
down
into
his
coat
i
going
out
before
i
catch
pneumonia
he
said
the
guard
saluted
dumbly
and
after
checking
his
proximity
detector
screens
he
slipped
out
and
the
heavy
portal
thudded
shut
behind
him
the
street
was
still
warm
from
the
heat
of
the
day
and
he
sighed
happily
and
opened
his
coat
this
was
partly
a
reconnaissance
trip
and
partly
a
way
of
getting
warmed
up
there
was
little
else
he
could
do
in
the
building
the
staff
had
long
since
retired
he
had
slept
for
a
half
an
hour
and
had
waked
refreshed
and
ready
to
work
all
of
the
reports
he
could
understand
had
been
read
and
reread
until
they
were
memorized
he
could
use
the
time
now
while
the
rest
of
them
were
asleep
to
get
better
acquainted
with
the
main
city
of
dis
as
he
walked
the
dark
streets
he
realized
how
alien
the
disan
way
of
life
was
to
everything
he
knew
this
city
hovedstad
literally
meant
main
place
in
the
native
language
and
that
all
it
was
it
was
only
the
presence
of
the
offworlders
that
made
it
into
a
city
building
after
building
standing
deserted
bore
the
names
of
mining
companies
traders
space
transporters
none
of
them
was
occupied
now
some
still
had
lights
burning
switched
on
by
automatic
apparatus
others
were
as
dark
as
the
disan
structures
there
were
many
of
these
native
constructions
and
they
seemed
out
of
place
among
the
rammed
earth
and
prefab
offworld
buildings
brion
examined
one
that
was
dimly
illuminated
by
the
light
on
the
corner
of
vegan
smelters
ltd
it
consisted
of
a
single
large
room
resting
right
on
the
ground
there
were
no
windows
and
the
whole
thing
appeared
to
have
been
constructed
of
some
sort
of
woven
material
plastered
with
mud
nothing
was
blocking
the
door
and
he
was
thinking
seriously
of
going
in
when
he
became
aware
that
he
was
being
followed
it
was
only
a
slight
noise
almost
lost
in
the
night
normally
it
would
never
have
been
noticed
but
tonight
brion
was
listening
with
his
entire
body
someone
was
behind
him
swallowed
up
in
the
pools
of
darkness
brion
shrank
back
against
the
wall
there
was
very
little
chance
this
could
be
anyone
but
a
disan
he
had
a
sudden
memory
of
mervv
severed
head
as
it
had
been
discovered
outside
the
door
ihjel
had
helped
him
train
his
empathetic
sense
and
he
reached
out
with
it
it
was
difficult
working
in
the
dark
he
could
be
sure
of
nothing
was
he
getting
a
reaction
or
just
wishing
for
one
why
did
it
have
a
ring
of
familiarity
to
it
a
sudden
idea
struck
him
ulv
he
said
very
softly
this
is
brion
he
crouched
ready
for
any
attack
i
know
a
voice
said
softly
in
the
night
do
not
talk
walk
in
the
direction
you
were
going
before
asking
questions
now
would
accomplish
nothing
brion
turned
instantly
and
did
as
he
was
bidden
the
buildings
grew
further
apart
until
he
realized
from
the
sand
underfoot
that
he
was
back
in
the
desert
it
could
be
a
trap
he
had
recognized
the
voice
behind
the
whisper
yet
he
had
to
take
this
chance
a
darker
shape
appeared
in
the
dark
night
near
him
and
a
burning
hot
hand
touched
his
arm
lightly
i
will
walk
ahead
follow
close
behind
me
the
words
were
louder
and
this
time
brion
recognized
the
voice
without
waiting
for
an
answer
ulv
turned
and
his
dimly
seen
shape
vanished
into
the
darkness
brion
moved
swiftly
after
him
until
they
walked
side
by
side
over
the
rolling
hills
of
sand
the
sand
merged
into
ground
became
cracked
and
scarred
with
gulleys
they
followed
a
deepening
gulley
that
grew
into
a
ravine
when
they
turned
an
angle
of
the
ravine
brion
saw
a
weak
yellow
light
coming
from
an
opening
in
the
hard
dirt
wall
ulv
dropped
on
all
fours
and
vanished
through
the
hole
brion
followed
him
trying
to
ignore
the
growing
tension
and
unease
he
felt
crawling
like
this
head
down
he
was
terribly
vulnerable
he
tried
to
shrug
off
the
feeling
mentally
blaming
it
on
tense
nerves
the
tunnel
was
short
and
opened
into
a
larger
chamber
a
sudden
scuffle
of
feet
sounded
at
the
same
instant
that
a
wave
of
empathetic
hatred
struck
him
it
took
vital
seconds
to
fight
his
way
out
of
the
trapping
tunnel
to
roll
clear
and
bring
his
gun
up
during
those
seconds
he
should
have
died
the
disan
poised
above
him
had
the
stone
hammer
raised
to
strike
a
blow
ulv
was
clutching
the
man
wrist
fighting
silently
to
keep
the
hammer
from
falling
neither
combatant
said
a
word
the
rasp
of
their
calloused
feet
on
the
sand
the
only
sound
brion
backed
away
from
the
struggling
men
his
gun
centered
on
the
stranger
the
disan
followed
him
with
burning
eyes
and
dropped
the
hammer
as
soon
as
it
was
obvious
the
attack
had
failed
why
did
you
bring
him
here
he
growled
at
ulv
why
did
you
kill
him
he
is
here
so
we
can
listen
to
what
he
says
gebk
he
is
the
one
i
told
you
of
that
i
found
in
the
desert
we
listen
to
what
he
says
and
then
we
kill
him
gebk
said
with
a
mirthless
grin
the
remark
was
meant
to
be
humorous
but
was
made
in
all
seriousness
brion
recognized
this
and
knew
that
there
was
no
danger
for
the
present
moment
he
slid
the
gun
away
and
for
the
first
time
looked
around
the
chamber
it
was
domed
in
shape
and
was
still
hot
from
the
heat
of
the
day
ulv
took
off
the
length
of
cloth
he
had
wrapped
around
his
body
against
the
chill
and
refolded
it
as
a
kilt
strapping
it
on
under
his
belt
artifacts
he
grunted
something
unintelligible
and
when
a
muttered
answer
came
brion
for
the
first
time
became
aware
of
the
woman
and
the
child
the
two
sat
against
the
far
wall
squatting
on
either
side
of
a
heap
of
fibrous
plants
both
were
nude
clothed
only
in
the
matted
hair
that
fell
below
their
shoulders
the
belt
of
strange
tools
could
not
be
classified
as
clothing
even
the
child
wore
a
tiny
replica
of
her
mother
putting
down
a
length
of
plant
she
had
been
chewing
the
woman
shuffled
over
to
the
tiny
fire
that
illuminated
the
room
a
clay
pot
stood
over
it
and
from
this
she
ladled
three
bowls
of
food
for
the
men
it
smelled
atrocious
and
brion
tried
not
to
taste
or
smell
the
sickening
mixture
while
he
ate
it
he
used
his
fingers
as
did
the
other
men
and
did
not
talk
while
he
ate
there
was
no
way
to
tell
if
the
silence
was
ritual
or
habit
it
gave
him
a
chance
for
a
closer
look
at
the
disan
way
of
living
the
cave
was
obviously
tool
marks
could
be
clearly
seen
in
the
hard
clay
of
the
walls
except
in
the
portion
opposite
the
entrance
this
was
covered
with
a
network
of
roots
rising
out
of
the
floor
and
vanishing
into
the
roof
of
earth
above
perhaps
this
was
the
reason
for
the
cave
existence
the
thin
roots
had
been
carefully
twisted
and
plaited
together
until
they
formed
a
single
swollen
root
in
the
center
as
thick
as
a
man
arm
from
this
hung
four
of
the
vaedes
ulv
had
placed
his
there
before
he
sat
down
the
teeth
must
have
instantly
sunk
in
for
it
hung
unsupported
another
link
in
the
disan
life
cycle
this
appeared
to
be
the
source
of
the
vaede
water
that
nourished
the
people
brion
was
aware
of
eyes
upon
him
and
turned
and
smiled
at
the
little
girl
she
could
have
been
over
six
years
old
but
she
was
already
a
disan
in
every
way
she
neither
returned
his
smile
nor
changed
her
expression
unchildlike
in
its
stolidity
her
hands
and
jaw
never
stopped
as
she
worked
on
the
lengths
of
fibrous
plant
her
mother
had
placed
before
her
the
child
split
them
with
a
small
tool
and
removed
a
pod
of
some
kind
this
was
peeled
partially
by
scraping
with
a
different
tool
and
partially
by
working
between
her
teeth
it
took
long
minutes
to
remove
the
tough
rind
the
results
seemed
scarcely
worth
it
a
tiny
wriggling
object
was
finally
disclosed
which
the
girl
instantly
swallowed
she
then
began
working
on
the
next
pod
ulv
put
down
his
clay
bowl
and
belched
i
brought
you
to
the
city
as
i
told
you
i
would
he
said
have
you
done
as
you
said
you
would
what
did
he
promise
gebk
asked
that
he
would
stop
the
war
have
you
stopped
it
i
am
trying
to
stop
it
brion
said
but
it
is
not
that
easy
i
need
some
help
it
is
your
life
that
needs
saving
yours
and
your
families
if
you
would
help
me
what
is
the
truth
ulv
broke
in
savagely
all
i
hear
is
difference
and
there
is
no
longer
any
way
to
tell
truth
for
as
long
as
always
we
have
done
as
the
magter
say
we
bring
them
food
and
they
give
us
the
metal
and
sometimes
water
when
we
need
it
as
long
as
we
do
as
they
ask
they
do
not
kill
us
they
live
the
wrong
way
but
i
have
had
bronze
from
them
for
my
tools
they
have
told
us
that
they
are
getting
a
world
for
us
from
the
sky
people
and
that
is
good
it
has
always
been
known
that
the
sky
people
are
evil
in
every
way
and
only
good
can
come
from
killing
them
gebk
said
brion
stared
back
at
the
two
disans
and
their
obvious
hatred
then
why
did
you
kill
me
ulv
he
asked
that
first
time
in
the
desert
or
tonight
when
you
stopped
gebk
i
could
have
but
there
was
something
more
important
what
is
the
truth
can
we
believe
as
we
have
always
done
or
should
we
listen
to
this
he
threw
a
small
sheet
of
plastic
to
brion
no
bigger
than
the
palm
of
his
hand
a
metal
button
was
fastened
to
one
corner
of
the
wafer
and
a
simple
drawing
was
imbedded
in
the
wafer
brion
held
it
to
the
light
and
saw
a
picture
of
a
man
hand
squeezing
the
button
between
thumb
and
forefinger
it
was
a
subminiaturized
playback
mechanical
pressure
on
the
case
provided
enough
current
to
play
the
recorded
message
the
plastic
sheet
vibrated
acting
as
a
loudspeaker
though
the
voice
was
thin
and
scratchy
the
words
were
clearly
audible
it
was
an
appeal
for
the
disan
people
not
to
listen
to
the
magter
it
explained
that
the
magter
had
started
a
war
that
could
have
only
one
ending
the
destruction
of
dis
only
if
the
magter
were
thrown
down
and
their
weapons
discovered
could
there
be
any
hope
are
these
words
true
ulv
asked
yes
brion
said
they
are
perhaps
true
gebk
said
but
there
is
nothing
that
we
can
do
i
was
with
my
brother
when
these
fell
out
of
the
sky
and
he
listened
to
one
and
took
it
to
the
magter
to
ask
them
they
killed
him
as
he
should
have
known
they
would
do
the
magter
kill
us
if
they
know
we
listen
to
the
words
and
the
words
tell
us
we
will
die
if
we
listen
to
the
magter
ulv
shouted
his
voice
cracking
not
with
fear
but
with
frustration
at
the
attempt
to
reconcile
two
opposite
points
of
view
up
until
this
time
his
world
had
consisted
of
black
and
white
values
with
very
few
shadings
of
difference
in
between
there
are
things
you
can
do
that
will
stop
the
war
without
hurting
yourself
or
the
magter
brion
said
searching
for
a
way
to
enlist
their
aid
tell
us
ulv
grunted
there
would
be
no
war
if
the
magter
could
be
contacted
made
to
listen
to
reason
they
are
killing
you
all
you
could
tell
me
how
to
talk
to
the
magter
how
i
could
understand
them
no
one
can
talk
to
the
magter
the
woman
broke
in
if
you
say
something
different
they
will
kill
you
as
they
killed
brother
so
they
are
easy
to
understand
that
is
the
way
they
are
they
do
not
change
she
put
the
length
of
plant
she
had
been
softening
for
the
child
back
into
her
mouth
her
lips
were
deeply
grooved
and
scarred
from
a
lifetime
of
this
work
her
teeth
at
the
sides
worn
almost
to
the
bone
mor
is
right
ulv
said
you
do
not
talk
to
magter
what
else
is
there
to
do
brion
looked
at
the
two
men
before
he
spoke
and
shifted
his
weight
the
motion
brought
his
fingertips
just
a
few
inches
from
his
gun
the
magter
have
bombs
that
will
destroy
nyjord
this
is
the
next
planet
a
star
in
your
sky
if
i
can
find
where
the
bombs
are
i
will
have
them
taken
away
and
there
will
be
no
war
you
want
to
aid
the
devils
in
the
sky
against
our
own
people
gebk
shouted
half
rising
ulv
pulled
him
back
to
the
ground
but
there
was
no
more
warmth
in
his
voice
as
he
spoke
you
are
asking
too
much
you
will
leave
now
will
you
help
me
though
will
you
help
stop
the
war
brion
asked
aware
he
had
gone
too
far
but
unable
to
stop
their
anger
was
making
them
forget
the
reasons
for
his
being
there
you
ask
too
much
ulv
said
again
go
back
now
we
will
talk
about
it
will
i
see
you
again
how
can
i
reach
you
we
will
find
you
if
we
wish
to
talk
to
you
was
all
ulv
said
if
they
decided
he
was
lying
he
would
never
see
them
again
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
about
it
i
have
made
up
my
mind
gebk
said
rising
to
his
feet
and
drawing
his
cloth
up
until
it
covered
his
shoulders
you
are
lying
and
this
is
all
a
lie
of
the
sky
people
if
i
see
you
again
i
will
kill
you
he
stepped
to
the
tunnel
and
was
gone
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
brion
went
out
next
checking
carefully
to
be
sure
that
gebk
really
had
left
and
ulv
guided
him
to
the
spot
where
the
lights
of
hovedstad
were
visible
he
did
not
speak
during
their
return
journey
and
vanished
without
a
word
brion
shivered
in
the
night
chill
of
the
air
and
wrapped
his
coat
more
tightly
around
himself
depressed
he
walked
back
towards
the
warmer
streets
of
the
city
it
was
dawn
when
he
reached
the
foundation
building
a
new
guard
was
at
the
front
entrance
no
amount
of
hammering
or
threats
could
convince
the
man
to
open
until
faussel
came
down
yawning
and
blinking
with
sleep
he
was
starting
some
complaint
when
brion
cut
him
off
curtly
and
ordered
him
to
finish
dressing
and
report
for
work
at
once
still
feeling
elated
brion
hurried
into
his
office
and
cursed
the
overly
efficient
character
who
had
turned
on
his
air
conditioner
to
chill
the
room
again
when
he
turned
it
off
this
time
he
removed
enough
vital
parts
to
keep
it
out
of
order
for
the
duration
when
faussel
came
in
he
was
still
yawning
behind
his
fist
obviously
a
low
type
before
you
fall
on
your
face
go
out
and
get
some
coffee
brion
said
two
cups
i
have
a
cup
too
that
wo
be
necessary
faussel
said
drawing
himself
up
stiffly
i
call
the
canteen
if
you
wish
some
he
said
it
in
the
iciest
tone
he
could
manage
this
early
in
the
morning
in
his
enthusiasm
brion
had
forgotten
the
hate
campaign
he
had
directed
against
himself
suit
yourself
he
said
shortly
getting
back
into
the
role
but
the
next
time
you
yawn
there
be
a
negative
entry
in
your
service
record
if
that
clear
you
can
brief
me
on
this
organization
visible
relations
with
the
disans
how
do
they
take
us
faussel
choked
and
swallowed
a
yawn
i
believe
they
look
on
the
people
as
some
species
of
simpleton
sir
they
hate
all
offworlders
memory
of
their
desertion
has
been
passed
on
verbally
for
generations
so
by
their
logic
we
should
either
hate
back
or
go
away
we
stay
instead
and
give
them
food
water
medicine
and
artifacts
because
of
this
they
let
us
remain
on
sufferance
i
imagine
they
consider
us
idiots
and
as
long
as
we
cause
no
trouble
they
let
us
stay
he
was
struggling
miserably
to
suppress
a
yawn
so
brion
turned
his
back
and
gave
him
a
chance
to
get
it
out
what
about
the
nyjorders
how
much
do
they
know
of
our
work
brion
looked
out
the
window
at
dusty
buildings
outlined
in
purple
against
the
violent
colors
of
the
desert
sunrise
nyjord
is
a
cooperating
planet
and
has
full
knowledge
at
all
executive
levels
they
are
giving
us
all
the
aid
they
can
well
now
is
the
time
to
ask
for
more
can
i
contact
the
commander
of
the
blockading
fleet
there
is
a
scrambler
connection
right
through
to
him
i
set
it
up
faussel
bent
over
the
desk
and
punched
a
number
into
the
phone
controls
the
screen
flowed
with
the
black
and
white
patterns
of
the
scrambler
that
all
faussel
brion
said
i
want
privacy
for
this
talk
what
the
commander
name
professor
krafft
he
a
physicist
they
have
no
military
men
at
all
so
they
called
him
in
for
the
construction
of
the
bombs
and
energy
weapons
he
still
in
charge
faussel
yawned
extravagantly
as
he
went
out
the
door
the
was
very
old
with
wispy
grey
hair
and
a
network
of
wrinkles
surrounding
his
eyes
his
image
shimmered
then
cleared
as
the
scrambler
units
aligned
you
must
be
brion
brandd
he
said
i
have
to
tell
you
how
sorry
we
all
are
that
your
friend
ihjel
and
the
two
others
had
to
die
after
coming
so
far
to
help
us
i
sure
you
are
very
happy
to
have
had
a
friend
like
that
why
yes
of
course
brion
said
reaching
for
the
scattered
fragments
of
his
thought
processes
it
took
an
effort
to
remember
the
first
conflict
now
that
he
was
worrying
about
the
death
of
a
planet
it
very
kind
of
you
to
mention
it
but
i
would
like
to
find
out
a
few
things
from
you
if
i
could
anything
at
all
we
are
at
your
disposal
before
we
begin
though
i
shall
pass
on
the
thanks
of
our
council
for
your
aid
in
joining
us
even
if
we
are
eventually
forced
to
drop
the
bombs
we
shall
never
forget
that
your
organization
did
everything
possible
to
avert
the
disaster
once
again
brion
was
caught
off
balance
for
an
instant
he
wondered
if
krafft
was
being
insincere
then
recognized
the
baseness
of
this
thought
the
completeness
of
the
man
humanity
was
obvious
and
compelling
the
thought
passed
through
brion
mind
that
now
he
had
an
additional
reason
for
wanting
the
war
ended
without
destruction
on
either
side
he
very
much
wanted
to
visit
nyjord
and
see
these
people
on
their
home
grounds
professor
krafft
waited
patiently
and
silently
while
brion
pulled
his
thoughts
together
and
answered
i
still
hope
that
this
thing
can
be
stopped
in
time
that
what
i
wanted
to
talk
to
you
about
i
want
to
see
and
i
thought
it
would
be
better
if
i
had
a
legitimate
reason
are
you
in
contact
with
him
krafft
shook
his
head
no
not
really
in
contact
when
this
trouble
started
i
sent
him
a
transceiver
so
we
could
talk
directly
but
he
has
delivered
his
ultimatum
speaking
for
the
magter
the
only
terms
he
will
hear
are
unconditional
surrender
his
receiver
is
on
but
he
has
said
that
is
the
only
message
he
will
answer
not
much
chance
of
him
ever
being
told
that
brion
said
there
was
at
one
time
i
hope
you
realize
brion
that
the
decision
to
bomb
dis
was
not
easily
arrived
at
a
great
many
people
myself
included
voted
for
unconditional
surrender
we
lost
the
vote
by
a
very
small
margin
brion
was
getting
used
to
these
philosophical
body
blows
and
he
rolled
with
the
punches
now
are
there
any
of
your
people
left
on
this
planet
or
do
you
have
any
troops
i
can
call
on
for
help
this
is
still
a
remote
possibility
but
if
i
do
find
out
where
the
bombs
or
the
launchers
are
a
surprise
raid
would
knock
them
out
we
have
no
people
left
in
hovedstad
now
all
the
ones
who
evacuated
were
killed
but
there
are
commando
teams
standing
by
here
to
make
a
landing
if
the
weapons
are
detected
the
disans
must
depend
on
secrecy
to
protect
their
armament
since
we
have
both
the
manpower
and
the
technology
to
reach
any
objective
we
also
have
technicians
and
other
volunteers
looking
for
the
weapon
sites
they
have
not
been
successful
as
yet
and
most
of
them
were
killed
soon
after
landing
krafft
hesitated
for
a
moment
there
is
another
group
you
should
know
about
you
will
need
all
the
factors
some
of
our
people
are
in
the
desert
outside
of
hovedstad
we
do
not
officially
approve
of
them
though
they
have
a
good
deal
of
popular
support
they
are
mostly
young
men
operating
as
raiders
killing
and
destroying
with
very
little
compunction
they
are
attempting
to
uncover
the
weapons
by
sheer
strength
of
arms
this
was
the
best
news
yet
brion
controlled
his
voice
and
kept
his
expression
calm
when
he
spoke
i
do
know
how
far
i
can
stretch
your
cooperation
but
could
you
possibly
tell
me
how
to
get
in
touch
with
them
kraft
allowed
himself
a
small
smile
i
give
you
the
wave
length
on
which
you
can
reach
their
radio
they
call
themselves
the
army
when
you
talk
to
them
you
can
do
me
a
favor
pass
on
a
message
just
to
prove
things
are
bad
enough
they
become
a
little
worse
one
of
our
technical
crews
has
detected
energy
transmissions
in
the
planetary
crust
the
disans
are
apparently
testing
their
projector
sooner
than
we
had
estimated
our
deadline
has
been
revised
by
one
day
i
afraid
there
are
only
two
days
left
before
you
must
evacuate
his
eyes
were
large
with
compassion
i
sorry
i
know
this
will
make
your
job
that
much
harder
brion
did
want
to
think
about
the
loss
of
a
full
day
from
his
already
close
deadline
have
you
told
the
disans
this
yet
no
krafft
told
him
the
decision
was
reached
a
few
minutes
before
your
call
it
is
going
on
the
radio
to
now
can
you
cancel
the
transmission
and
let
me
take
the
message
in
person
i
can
do
that
krafft
thought
for
a
moment
but
it
would
surely
mean
your
death
at
their
hands
they
have
no
hesitation
in
killing
any
of
our
people
i
would
prefer
to
send
it
by
radio
if
you
do
that
you
will
be
interfering
with
my
plans
and
perhaps
destroying
them
under
the
guise
of
saving
my
life
is
my
life
my
own
to
dispose
of
as
i
will
for
the
first
time
professor
krafft
was
upset
i
sorry
terribly
sorry
i
letting
my
concern
and
worry
wash
over
into
my
public
affairs
of
course
you
may
do
as
you
please
i
could
never
think
of
stopping
you
he
turned
and
said
something
inaudible
offscreen
the
call
is
cancelled
the
responsibility
is
yours
all
our
wishes
for
success
go
with
you
end
of
transmission
end
of
transmission
brion
said
and
the
screen
went
dark
faussel
he
shouted
into
the
intercom
get
me
the
best
and
fastest
sand
car
we
have
a
driver
who
knows
his
way
around
and
two
men
who
can
handle
a
gun
and
know
how
to
take
orders
we
going
to
get
some
positive
action
at
last
x
it
suicide
the
taller
guard
grumbled
mine
not
yours
so
do
worry
about
it
brion
barked
at
him
your
job
is
to
remember
your
orders
and
keep
them
straight
now
let
hear
them
again
the
guard
rolled
his
eyes
up
in
silent
rebellion
and
repeated
in
a
toneless
voice
we
stay
here
in
the
car
and
keep
the
motor
running
while
you
go
inside
the
stone
pile
there
we
do
let
anybody
in
the
car
and
we
try
and
keep
them
clear
of
the
car
short
of
shooting
them
that
is
we
do
come
in
no
matter
what
happens
or
what
it
looks
like
but
wait
for
you
here
unless
you
call
on
the
radio
in
which
case
we
come
in
with
the
automatics
going
and
shoot
the
place
up
and
it
does
matter
who
we
hit
this
will
be
done
only
as
a
last
resort
see
if
you
ca
arrange
that
last
resort
thing
the
other
guard
said
patting
the
heavy
blue
barrel
of
his
weapon
i
meant
that
resort
brion
said
angrily
if
any
guns
go
off
without
my
permission
you
will
pay
for
it
and
pay
with
your
necks
i
want
that
clearly
understood
you
are
here
as
a
rear
guard
and
a
base
for
me
to
get
back
to
this
is
my
operation
and
mine
alone
unless
i
call
you
in
understood
he
waited
until
all
three
men
had
nodded
in
agreement
then
checked
the
charge
on
his
gun
it
was
fully
loaded
it
would
be
foolish
to
go
in
unarmed
but
he
had
to
one
gun
would
save
him
he
put
it
aside
the
button
radio
on
his
collar
was
working
and
had
a
strong
enough
signal
to
get
through
any
number
of
walls
he
took
off
his
coat
threw
open
the
door
and
stepped
out
into
the
searing
brilliance
of
the
disan
noon
there
was
only
the
desert
silence
broken
by
the
steady
throb
of
the
car
motor
behind
him
stretching
away
to
the
horizon
in
every
direction
was
the
eternal
desert
of
sand
the
keep
stood
nearby
solitary
a
massive
pile
of
black
rock
brion
plodded
closer
watching
for
any
motion
from
the
walls
nothing
stirred
the
irregularly
shaped
construction
sat
in
a
ponderous
silence
brion
was
sweating
now
only
partially
from
the
heat
he
circled
the
thing
looking
for
a
gate
there
was
one
at
ground
level
a
slanting
cleft
in
the
stone
could
be
climbed
easily
but
it
seemed
incredible
that
this
might
be
the
only
entrance
a
complete
circuit
proved
that
it
was
brion
looked
unhappily
at
the
slanting
and
broken
ramp
then
cupped
his
hands
and
shouted
loudly
i
coming
up
your
radio
does
work
any
more
i
bringing
the
message
from
nyjord
that
you
have
been
waiting
to
hear
this
was
a
slight
bending
of
the
truth
without
fracturing
it
there
was
no
answer
just
the
hiss
of
sand
against
the
rock
and
the
mutter
of
the
car
in
the
background
he
started
to
climb
the
rock
underfoot
was
crumbling
and
he
had
to
watch
where
he
put
his
feet
at
the
same
time
he
fought
a
constant
impulse
to
look
up
watching
for
anything
falling
from
above
nothing
happened
when
he
reached
the
top
of
the
wall
he
was
breathing
hard
sweat
moistened
his
body
there
was
still
no
one
in
sight
he
stood
on
an
unevenly
shaped
wall
that
appeared
to
circle
the
building
instead
of
having
a
courtyard
inside
it
the
wall
was
the
outer
face
of
the
structure
the
domed
roof
rising
from
it
at
varying
intervals
dark
openings
gave
access
to
the
interior
when
brion
looked
down
the
sand
car
was
just
a
bump
in
the
desert
already
far
behind
him
stooping
he
went
through
the
nearest
door
there
was
still
no
one
in
sight
the
room
inside
was
something
out
of
a
madman
funhouse
it
was
higher
than
it
was
wide
irregular
in
shape
and
more
like
a
hallway
than
a
room
at
one
end
it
merged
into
an
incline
that
became
a
stairwell
at
the
other
it
ended
in
a
hole
that
vanished
in
darkness
below
light
of
sorts
filtered
in
through
slots
and
holes
drilled
into
the
thick
stone
wall
everything
was
built
of
the
same
but
strong
rock
brion
took
the
stairs
after
a
number
of
blind
passages
and
wrong
turns
he
saw
a
stronger
light
ahead
and
went
on
there
was
food
metal
even
artifacts
of
the
unusual
disan
design
in
the
different
rooms
he
passed
through
yet
no
people
the
light
ahead
grew
stronger
and
the
last
passageway
opened
and
swelled
out
until
it
led
into
the
large
central
chamber
this
was
the
heart
of
the
strange
structure
all
the
rooms
passageways
and
halls
existed
just
to
give
form
to
this
gigantic
chamber
the
walls
rose
sharply
the
room
being
circular
in
cross
section
and
growing
narrower
towards
the
top
it
was
a
truncated
cone
since
there
was
no
ceiling
a
hot
blue
disk
of
sky
cast
light
on
the
floor
below
on
the
floor
stood
a
knot
of
men
who
stared
at
brion
out
of
the
corner
of
his
eyes
and
with
the
very
periphery
of
his
consciousness
he
was
aware
of
the
rest
of
the
room
barrels
stores
machinery
a
radio
transceiver
various
bundles
and
heaps
that
made
no
sense
at
first
glance
there
was
no
time
to
look
closer
every
fraction
of
his
attention
was
focused
on
the
muffled
and
hooded
men
he
had
found
the
enemy
everything
that
had
happened
to
him
so
far
on
dis
had
been
preparation
for
this
moment
the
attack
in
the
desert
the
escape
the
dreadful
heat
of
sun
and
sand
all
this
had
tempered
and
prepared
him
it
had
been
nothing
in
itself
now
the
battle
would
begin
in
earnest
none
of
this
was
conscious
in
his
mind
his
fighter
reflexes
bent
his
shoulders
curved
his
hands
before
him
as
he
walked
softly
in
balance
ready
to
spring
in
any
direction
yet
none
of
this
was
really
necessary
all
the
danger
so
far
was
nonphysical
when
he
did
give
conscious
thought
to
the
situation
he
stopped
startled
what
was
wrong
here
none
of
the
men
had
moved
or
made
a
sound
how
could
he
even
know
they
were
men
they
were
so
muffled
and
wrapped
in
cloth
that
only
their
eyes
were
exposed
no
doubt
however
existed
in
brion
mind
in
spite
of
muffled
cloth
and
silence
he
knew
them
for
what
they
were
the
eyes
were
empty
of
expression
and
unmoving
yet
were
filled
with
the
same
negative
emptiness
as
those
of
a
bird
of
prey
they
could
look
on
life
death
and
the
rending
of
flesh
with
the
same
lack
of
interest
and
compassion
all
this
brion
knew
in
an
instant
of
time
without
words
being
spoken
between
the
time
he
lifted
one
foot
and
walked
a
step
he
understood
what
he
had
to
face
there
could
be
no
doubt
not
to
an
empathetic
from
the
group
of
silent
men
poured
a
wave
of
unemotion
an
empathetic
shares
what
other
men
feel
he
gets
his
knowledge
of
their
reaction
by
sensing
lightly
their
emotions
the
surges
of
interest
hate
love
fear
desire
the
sweep
of
large
and
small
sensations
that
accompany
all
thought
and
action
the
empathetic
is
always
aware
of
this
constant
and
silent
surge
whether
he
makes
the
effort
to
understand
it
or
not
he
is
like
a
man
glancing
across
the
open
pages
of
a
tableful
of
books
he
can
see
that
the
type
words
paragraphs
thoughts
are
there
even
without
focusing
his
attention
to
understand
any
of
it
then
how
does
the
man
feel
when
he
glances
at
the
open
books
and
sees
only
blank
pages
the
books
are
there
the
words
are
not
he
turns
the
pages
of
one
of
the
others
flipping
the
pages
searching
for
meaning
there
is
no
meaning
all
of
the
pages
are
blank
this
was
the
way
in
which
the
magter
were
blank
without
emotions
there
was
a
barely
sensed
surge
and
return
that
must
have
been
neural
impulses
on
a
basic
level
the
automatic
adjustments
of
nerve
and
muscle
that
keep
an
organism
alive
nothing
more
brion
reached
for
other
sensations
but
there
was
nothing
there
to
grasp
either
these
men
were
without
emotions
or
they
were
able
to
block
them
from
his
detection
it
was
impossible
to
tell
which
very
little
time
had
passed
while
brion
made
these
discoveries
the
knot
of
men
still
looked
at
him
silent
and
unmoving
they
expectant
their
attitude
could
not
have
been
called
one
of
interest
but
he
had
come
to
them
and
now
they
waited
to
find
out
why
any
questions
or
statements
they
spoke
would
be
superfluous
so
they
did
speak
the
responsibility
was
his
i
have
come
to
talk
with
who
is
he
brion
did
like
the
tiny
sound
his
voice
made
in
the
immense
room
one
of
the
men
gave
a
slight
motion
to
draw
attention
to
himself
none
of
the
others
moved
they
still
waited
i
have
a
message
for
you
brion
said
speaking
slowly
to
fill
the
silence
of
the
room
and
the
emptiness
of
his
thoughts
this
had
to
be
handled
right
but
what
was
right
i
from
the
foundation
in
the
city
as
you
undoubtedly
know
i
been
talking
to
the
people
of
nyjord
they
have
a
message
for
you
the
silence
grew
longer
brion
had
no
intention
of
making
this
a
monologue
he
needed
facts
to
operate
to
form
an
opinion
looking
at
the
silent
forms
was
telling
him
nothing
time
stretched
taut
and
finally
spoke
the
nyjorders
are
going
to
surrender
it
was
an
impossibly
strange
sentence
brion
had
never
realized
before
how
much
of
the
content
of
speech
was
made
up
of
emotion
if
the
man
had
given
it
a
positive
emphasis
perhaps
said
it
with
enthusiasm
it
would
have
meant
success
the
enemy
is
going
to
surrender
this
was
the
meaning
with
a
rising
inflection
on
the
end
it
would
have
been
a
question
are
they
going
to
surrender
it
was
neither
of
these
the
sentence
carried
no
other
message
than
that
contained
in
the
simplest
meanings
of
the
separate
words
it
had
intellectual
connotations
but
these
could
only
be
gained
from
past
knowledge
not
from
the
sound
of
the
words
there
was
only
one
message
they
were
prepared
to
receive
from
nyjord
therefore
brion
was
bringing
the
message
if
that
was
not
the
message
brion
was
bringing
the
men
here
were
not
interested
this
was
the
vital
fact
if
they
were
not
interested
he
could
have
no
further
value
to
them
since
he
came
from
the
enemy
he
was
the
enemy
therefore
he
would
be
killed
because
this
was
vital
to
his
existence
brion
took
the
time
to
follow
the
thought
through
it
made
logical
sense
and
logic
was
all
he
could
depend
on
now
he
could
be
talking
to
robots
or
alien
creatures
for
all
the
human
response
he
was
receiving
you
ca
win
this
war
all
you
can
do
is
hurry
your
own
deaths
he
said
this
with
as
much
conviction
as
he
could
realizing
at
the
same
time
that
it
was
wasted
effort
no
flicker
of
response
stirred
in
the
men
before
him
the
nyjorders
know
you
have
the
cobalt
bombs
and
they
have
detected
your
projector
they
take
any
more
chances
they
have
pushed
the
deadline
closer
by
an
entire
day
there
are
one
and
a
half
days
left
before
the
bombs
fall
and
you
are
all
destroyed
do
you
realize
what
that
means
is
that
the
message
asked
yes
brion
said
two
things
saved
his
life
then
he
had
guessed
what
would
happen
as
soon
as
they
had
his
message
though
he
had
been
sure
but
even
the
suspicion
had
put
him
on
his
guard
this
combined
with
the
reflexes
of
a
winner
of
the
twenties
was
barely
enough
to
enable
him
to
survive
from
frozen
mobility
had
catapulted
into
headlong
attack
as
he
leaped
forward
he
drew
a
curved
blade
from
under
his
robes
it
plunged
unerringly
through
the
spot
where
brion
body
had
been
an
instant
before
there
had
been
no
time
to
tense
his
muscles
and
jump
just
the
space
of
time
to
relax
them
and
fall
to
one
side
his
reasoning
mind
joined
the
battle
as
he
hit
the
floor
plunged
by
him
turning
and
bringing
the
knife
down
at
the
same
time
brion
foot
lashed
out
and
caught
the
other
man
leg
sending
him
sprawling
they
were
both
on
their
feet
at
the
same
instant
facing
each
other
brion
now
had
his
hands
clasped
before
him
in
the
unarmed
best
defense
against
a
knife
the
two
arms
protecting
the
body
the
two
hands
joined
to
beat
aside
the
knife
arm
from
whichever
direction
it
came
the
disan
hunched
low
flipped
the
knife
quickly
from
hand
to
hand
then
thrust
it
again
at
brion
midriff
only
by
the
merest
fractional
margin
did
brion
evade
the
attack
for
the
second
time
fought
with
utter
violence
every
action
was
as
intense
as
possible
deadly
and
thorough
there
could
be
only
one
end
to
this
unequal
contest
if
brion
stayed
on
the
defensive
the
man
with
the
knife
had
to
win
with
the
next
charge
brion
changed
tactics
he
leaped
inside
the
thrust
clutching
for
the
knife
arm
a
burning
slice
of
pain
cut
across
his
arm
then
his
fingers
clutched
the
tendoned
wrist
they
clamped
down
hard
grinding
shut
compressing
with
the
tightening
intensity
of
a
closing
vise
it
was
all
he
could
do
simply
to
hold
on
there
was
no
science
in
it
just
his
greater
strength
from
exercise
and
existence
on
a
heavier
planet
all
of
this
strength
went
to
his
clutching
hand
because
he
held
his
own
life
in
that
hand
forcing
away
the
knife
that
wanted
to
terminate
it
forever
nothing
else
mattered
neither
the
frightening
force
of
the
knees
that
thudded
into
his
body
nor
the
hooked
fingers
that
reached
for
his
eyes
to
tear
them
out
he
protected
his
face
as
well
as
he
could
while
the
nails
tore
furrows
through
his
flesh
and
the
cut
on
his
arm
bled
freely
these
were
only
minor
things
to
be
endured
his
life
depended
on
the
grasp
of
the
fingers
of
his
right
hand
there
was
a
sudden
immobility
as
brion
succeeded
in
clutching
other
arm
it
was
a
good
grip
and
he
could
hold
the
arm
immobilized
they
had
reached
stasis
standing
knee
to
knee
their
faces
only
a
few
inches
apart
the
muffling
cloth
had
fallen
from
the
disan
face
during
the
struggle
and
empty
frigid
eyes
stared
into
brion
no
flicker
of
emotion
crossed
the
harsh
planes
of
the
other
man
face
a
great
puckered
white
scar
covered
one
cheek
and
pulled
up
a
corner
of
the
mouth
in
a
cheerless
grimace
it
was
false
there
was
still
no
expression
here
even
when
the
pain
must
be
growing
more
intense
brion
was
winning
if
none
of
the
watchers
broke
the
impasse
his
greater
weight
and
strength
counted
now
the
disan
would
have
to
drop
the
knife
before
his
arm
was
dislocated
at
the
shoulder
he
did
do
it
with
sudden
horror
brion
realized
that
he
going
to
drop
it
no
matter
what
happened
a
dull
hideous
snap
jerked
through
the
disan
body
and
the
arm
hung
limp
and
dead
no
expression
crossed
the
man
face
the
knife
was
still
locked
in
the
fingers
of
the
paralyzed
hand
with
his
other
hand
reached
across
and
started
to
pry
the
blade
loose
ready
to
continue
the
battle
brion
raised
his
foot
and
kicked
the
knife
free
sending
it
spinning
across
the
room
made
a
fist
of
his
good
hand
and
crashed
it
into
groin
he
was
still
fighting
as
if
nothing
had
changed
brion
backed
slowly
away
from
the
man
stop
it
he
said
you
ca
win
now
it
impossible
he
called
to
the
other
men
who
were
watching
the
unequal
battle
with
expressionless
immobility
no
one
answered
him
with
a
terrible
sinking
sensation
brion
then
realized
what
would
happen
and
what
he
had
to
do
was
as
heedless
of
his
own
life
as
he
was
of
the
life
of
his
planet
he
would
press
the
attack
no
matter
what
damage
was
done
to
him
brion
had
an
insane
vision
of
him
breaking
the
man
other
arm
fracturing
both
his
legs
and
the
limbless
broken
creature
still
coming
forward
crawling
rolling
teeth
bared
since
they
were
the
only
remaining
weapon
there
was
only
one
way
to
end
it
brion
feinted
and
the
arm
moved
clear
of
his
body
the
engulfing
cloth
was
thin
and
through
it
brion
could
see
the
outlines
of
the
disan
abdomen
and
rib
cage
the
clear
location
of
the
great
nerve
ganglion
it
was
the
death
blow
of
brion
had
never
used
it
on
a
man
in
practice
he
had
broken
heavy
boards
splintering
them
instantly
with
the
short
precise
stroke
the
stiffened
hand
moving
forward
in
a
sudden
surge
all
the
weight
and
energy
of
his
body
concentrated
in
his
joined
fingertips
plunging
deep
into
the
other
flesh
killing
not
by
accident
or
in
sudden
anger
killing
because
this
was
the
only
way
the
battle
could
possibly
end
like
a
ruined
tower
of
flesh
the
disan
crumpled
and
fell
dripping
blood
exhausted
brion
stood
over
the
body
of
and
stared
at
the
dead
man
allies
death
filled
the
room
xi
facing
the
silent
disans
brion
thoughts
hurtled
about
in
sweeping
circles
there
would
be
no
more
than
an
instant
tick
of
time
before
the
magter
avenged
themselves
bloodily
and
completely
he
felt
a
fleeting
regret
for
not
having
brought
his
gun
then
abandoned
the
thought
there
was
no
time
for
regrets
what
could
he
do
the
silent
watchers
had
attacked
instantly
and
brion
realized
that
they
could
be
positive
yet
that
had
been
killed
only
brion
himself
knew
the
deadliness
of
that
blow
their
lack
of
knowledge
might
buy
him
a
little
more
time
is
unconscious
but
he
will
revive
quickly
brion
said
pointing
at
the
huddled
body
as
the
eyes
turned
automatically
to
follow
his
finger
he
began
walking
slowly
towards
the
exit
i
did
not
want
to
do
this
but
he
forced
me
to
because
he
would
listen
to
reason
now
i
have
something
else
to
show
you
something
that
i
hoped
it
would
not
be
necessary
to
reveal
he
was
saying
the
first
words
that
came
into
his
head
trying
to
keep
them
distracted
as
long
as
possible
he
must
appear
to
be
only
going
across
the
room
that
was
the
feeling
he
must
generate
there
was
even
time
to
stop
for
a
second
and
straighten
his
rumpled
clothing
and
brush
the
sweat
from
his
eyes
talking
easily
walking
slowly
towards
the
hall
that
led
out
of
the
chamber
he
was
halfway
there
when
the
spell
broke
and
the
rush
began
one
of
the
magter
knelt
and
touched
the
body
and
shouted
a
single
word
dead
brion
had
waited
for
the
official
announcement
at
the
first
movement
of
feet
he
dived
headlong
for
the
shelter
of
the
exit
there
was
a
spatter
of
tiny
missiles
on
the
wall
next
to
him
and
he
had
a
brief
glimpse
of
raised
blowguns
before
the
wall
intervened
he
went
up
the
dimly
lit
stairs
three
at
a
time
the
pack
was
just
behind
him
voiceless
and
deadly
he
could
not
gain
on
them
if
anything
they
were
closing
the
distance
as
he
pushed
his
already
tired
body
to
the
utmost
there
was
no
subtlety
or
trick
he
could
use
now
just
straightforward
flight
back
the
way
he
had
come
a
single
slip
on
the
irregular
steps
and
it
would
be
all
over
there
was
someone
ahead
of
him
if
the
woman
had
waited
a
few
seconds
more
he
would
certainly
have
been
killed
but
instead
of
slashing
at
him
as
he
went
by
the
doorway
she
made
the
mistake
of
rushing
to
the
center
of
the
stairs
the
knife
ready
to
impale
him
as
he
came
up
without
slowing
brion
fell
onto
his
hands
and
easily
dodged
under
the
blow
as
he
passed
he
twisted
and
seized
her
around
the
waist
picking
her
from
the
ground
when
her
legs
lifted
from
under
her
the
woman
screamed
the
first
human
sound
brion
had
heard
in
this
human
anthill
his
pursuers
were
just
behind
him
and
he
hurled
the
woman
into
them
with
all
his
strength
they
fell
in
a
tangle
and
brion
used
the
precious
seconds
gained
to
reach
the
top
of
the
building
there
must
have
been
other
stairs
and
exits
because
one
of
the
magter
stood
between
brion
and
the
way
down
out
of
this
trap
armed
and
ready
to
kill
him
if
he
tried
to
pass
as
he
ran
towards
the
executioner
brion
flicked
on
his
collar
radio
and
shouted
into
it
i
in
trouble
here
can
you
the
guards
in
the
car
must
have
been
waiting
for
this
message
before
he
had
finished
there
was
the
thud
of
a
slug
hitting
flesh
and
the
disan
spun
and
fell
blood
soaking
his
shoulder
brion
leaped
over
him
and
headed
for
the
ramp
the
next
one
is
me
hold
your
fire
he
called
both
guards
must
have
had
their
telescopic
sights
zeroed
on
the
spot
they
let
brion
pass
then
threw
in
a
hail
of
fire
that
tore
chunks
from
the
stone
and
screamed
away
in
noisy
ricochets
brion
did
try
to
see
if
anyone
was
braving
this
hail
of
covering
fire
he
concentrated
his
energies
on
making
as
quick
and
erratic
a
descent
as
he
could
above
the
sounds
of
the
firing
he
heard
the
car
motor
howl
as
it
leaped
forward
with
their
careful
aim
spoiled
the
gunners
switched
to
full
automatic
and
unleashed
a
hailstorm
of
flying
metal
that
bracketed
the
top
of
the
tower
cease
firing
brion
gasped
into
the
radio
as
he
ran
the
driver
was
good
and
timed
his
arrival
with
exactitude
the
car
reached
the
base
of
the
tower
at
the
same
instant
brion
did
and
he
burst
through
the
door
while
it
was
still
moving
no
orders
were
necessary
he
fell
headlong
onto
a
seat
as
the
car
swung
in
a
turn
and
ground
into
high
gear
back
to
the
city
reaching
over
carefully
the
tall
guard
gently
extracted
a
bit
of
pointed
wood
and
fluff
from
a
fold
of
brion
pants
he
cracked
open
the
car
door
and
just
as
delicately
threw
it
out
i
knew
that
thing
did
touch
you
he
said
since
you
are
still
among
the
living
they
got
a
poison
on
those
blowgun
darts
that
takes
all
of
twelve
seconds
to
work
lucky
lucky
brion
was
beginning
to
realize
just
how
lucky
he
was
to
be
out
of
the
trap
alive
and
with
information
now
that
he
knew
more
about
the
magter
he
shuddered
at
his
innocence
in
walking
alone
and
unarmed
into
the
tower
skill
had
helped
him
survive
but
better
than
average
luck
had
been
necessary
curiosity
had
gotten
him
in
brashness
and
speed
had
taken
him
out
he
was
exhausted
battered
and
bloody
but
cheerfully
happy
the
facts
about
the
magter
were
arranging
themselves
into
a
theory
that
might
explain
their
attempt
at
racial
suicide
it
just
needed
a
little
time
to
be
put
into
shape
a
pain
cut
across
his
arm
and
he
jumped
startled
pieces
of
his
thoughts
crashing
into
ruin
around
him
the
gunner
had
cracked
the
box
and
was
swabbing
his
arm
with
antiseptic
the
knife
wound
was
long
but
not
deep
brion
shivered
while
the
bandage
was
going
on
then
quickly
slipped
into
his
coat
the
air
conditioner
whined
industriously
bringing
down
the
temperature
there
was
no
attempt
to
follow
the
car
when
the
black
tower
had
dropped
over
the
horizon
the
guards
relaxed
ran
cleaning
rods
through
their
guns
and
compared
marksmanship
all
of
their
antagonism
towards
brion
was
gone
they
actually
smiled
at
him
he
had
given
them
the
first
chance
to
shoot
back
since
they
had
been
on
this
planet
the
ride
was
uneventful
and
brion
was
scarcely
aware
of
it
a
theory
was
taking
form
in
his
mind
it
was
radical
and
startling
yet
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
one
that
fitted
the
facts
he
pushed
at
it
from
all
sides
but
if
there
were
any
holes
he
could
find
them
what
it
needed
was
dispassionate
proving
or
disproving
there
was
only
one
person
on
dis
who
was
qualified
to
do
this
lea
was
working
in
the
lab
when
he
came
in
bent
over
a
binocular
microscope
something
small
limbless
and
throbbing
was
on
the
slide
she
glanced
up
when
she
heard
his
footsteps
smiling
warmly
when
she
recognized
him
fatigue
and
pain
had
drawn
her
face
her
skin
glistening
with
burn
ointment
was
chapped
and
peeling
i
must
look
a
wreck
she
said
putting
the
back
of
her
hand
to
her
cheek
something
like
a
and
lightly
cooked
piece
of
beef
she
lowered
her
arm
suddenly
and
took
his
hand
in
both
of
hers
her
palms
were
warm
and
slightly
moist
thank
you
brion
was
all
she
could
say
her
society
on
earth
was
highly
civilized
and
sophisticated
able
to
discuss
any
topic
without
emotion
and
without
embarrassment
this
was
fine
in
most
circumstances
but
made
it
difficult
to
thank
a
person
for
saving
your
life
however
you
tried
to
phrase
it
it
came
out
sounding
like
a
speech
from
a
historical
play
there
was
no
doubt
however
as
to
what
she
meant
her
eyes
were
large
and
dark
the
pupils
dilated
by
the
drugs
she
had
been
given
they
could
not
lie
nor
could
the
emotions
he
sensed
he
did
not
answer
just
held
her
hand
an
instant
longer
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
concerned
his
conscience
twinged
as
he
remembered
that
he
was
the
one
who
had
ordered
her
out
of
bed
and
back
to
work
today
i
should
be
feeling
terrible
she
said
with
an
airy
wave
of
her
hand
but
i
walking
on
top
of
the
world
i
so
loaded
with
and
stimulants
that
i
high
as
the
moon
all
the
nerves
to
my
feet
feel
turned
off
it
like
walking
on
two
balls
of
fluff
thanks
for
getting
me
out
of
that
awful
hospital
and
back
to
work
brion
was
suddenly
sorry
for
having
driven
her
from
her
sick
bed
do
be
sorry
lea
said
apparently
reading
his
mind
but
really
seeing
only
his
sudden
ashamed
expression
i
feeling
no
pain
honestly
i
feel
a
little
and
foggy
at
times
nothing
more
and
this
is
the
job
i
came
here
to
do
in
fact
well
almost
impossible
to
tell
you
just
how
fascinating
it
all
is
it
was
almost
worth
getting
baked
and
parboiled
for
she
swung
back
to
the
microscope
centering
the
specimen
with
a
turn
of
the
stage
adjustment
screw
poor
ihjel
was
right
when
he
said
this
planet
was
exobiologically
fascinating
this
is
a
gastropod
a
lot
like
but
it
has
parasitical
morphological
changes
so
profound
that
there
something
else
i
remember
brion
said
interrupting
her
enthusiastic
lecture
only
half
of
which
he
could
understand
did
ihjel
also
hope
that
you
would
give
some
study
to
the
natives
as
well
as
their
environment
the
problem
is
with
the
disans
not
with
the
local
wild
life
but
i
studying
them
lea
insisted
the
disans
have
attained
an
incredibly
advanced
form
of
commensalism
their
lives
are
so
intimately
connected
and
integrated
with
the
other
life
forms
that
they
must
be
studied
in
relation
to
their
environment
i
doubt
if
they
show
as
many
external
physical
changes
as
little
on
the
slide
here
but
there
will
surely
be
a
number
of
psychological
changes
and
adjustments
that
will
crop
up
one
of
these
might
be
the
explanation
of
their
urge
for
planetary
suicide
that
may
be
true
but
i
do
think
so
brion
said
i
went
on
a
little
expedition
this
morning
and
found
something
that
has
more
immediate
relevancy
for
the
first
time
lea
became
aware
of
his
slightly
battered
condition
her
mind
could
only
follow
a
single
idea
at
a
time
and
had
the
significance
of
the
bandage
and
dirt
i
been
visiting
brion
said
forestalling
the
question
on
her
lips
the
magter
are
the
ones
who
are
responsible
for
causing
the
trouble
and
i
had
to
see
them
up
close
before
i
could
make
any
decisions
it
was
a
very
pleasant
thing
but
i
found
out
what
i
wanted
to
know
they
are
different
in
every
way
from
the
normal
disans
i
compared
them
i
talked
to
ulv
the
native
who
saved
us
in
the
desert
and
i
can
understand
him
he
is
not
like
us
in
many
ways
he
certainly
could
be
living
in
this
oven
but
he
is
still
undeniably
human
he
gave
us
drinking
water
when
we
needed
it
then
brought
help
the
magter
the
lords
of
dis
are
the
direct
opposite
as
and
ruthless
a
bunch
of
murderers
as
you
can
possibly
imagine
they
tried
to
kill
me
when
they
met
me
without
reason
their
clothes
habits
dwellings
manners
everything
about
them
differs
from
that
of
the
normal
disan
more
important
the
magter
are
as
coldly
efficient
and
inhuman
as
a
reptile
they
have
no
emotions
no
love
no
hate
no
anger
no
fear
nothing
each
of
them
is
a
chilling
bundle
of
thought
processes
and
reactions
with
all
the
emotions
removed
are
you
exaggerating
lea
asked
after
all
you
ca
be
sure
it
might
just
be
part
of
their
training
not
to
reveal
any
emotional
state
everyone
must
experience
emotional
states
whether
they
like
it
or
not
that
my
main
point
everyone
does
except
the
magter
i
ca
go
into
all
the
details
now
so
you
just
have
to
take
my
word
for
it
even
at
the
point
of
death
they
have
no
fear
or
hatred
it
may
sound
impossible
but
it
is
true
lea
tried
to
shake
the
knots
from
her
mind
i
dull
today
she
said
you
have
to
excuse
me
if
these
rulers
had
no
emotional
responses
that
might
explain
their
present
suicidal
position
but
an
explanation
like
this
raises
more
new
problems
than
it
supplies
answers
to
the
old
ones
how
did
they
get
this
way
it
does
seem
humanly
possible
to
be
without
emotions
of
some
kind
just
my
point
not
possible
i
think
these
ruling
class
disans
are
human
at
all
like
the
other
disans
i
think
they
are
alien
creatures
robots
or
androids
anything
except
men
i
think
they
are
living
in
disguise
among
the
normal
human
dwellers
at
first
lea
started
to
smile
then
her
feeling
changed
when
she
saw
his
face
you
are
serious
she
asked
never
more
so
i
realize
it
must
sound
as
if
i
had
my
brains
bounced
around
too
much
this
morning
yet
this
is
the
only
idea
i
can
come
up
with
that
fits
all
of
the
facts
look
at
the
evidence
yourself
one
simple
thing
stands
out
clearly
and
must
be
considered
first
if
any
theory
is
to
hold
up
that
is
the
complete
indifference
to
death
their
own
or
anyone
else
is
that
normal
to
mankind
no
but
i
can
find
a
couple
of
explanations
that
i
would
rather
explore
first
before
dragging
in
an
alien
life
form
there
may
have
been
a
mutation
or
an
inherited
disease
that
has
deformed
or
warped
their
minds
would
that
be
sort
of
brion
asked
people
who
die
before
puberty
would
find
it
a
little
difficult
to
pass
on
a
mutation
to
their
children
but
let
not
beat
this
one
point
to
death
it
the
totality
of
these
people
that
i
find
so
hard
to
accept
any
one
thing
might
be
explained
away
but
not
the
collection
of
them
what
about
their
complete
lack
of
emotion
or
their
manner
of
dress
and
their
secrecy
in
general
the
ordinary
disan
wears
a
cloth
kilt
while
the
magter
cover
themselves
as
completely
as
possible
they
stay
in
their
black
towers
and
never
go
out
except
in
groups
their
dead
are
always
removed
so
they
ca
be
examined
in
every
way
they
act
like
a
race
apart
and
i
think
they
are
granted
for
the
moment
that
this
outlandish
idea
might
be
true
how
did
they
get
here
and
why
does
anyone
know
about
it
besides
them
easily
enough
explained
brion
insisted
there
are
no
written
records
on
this
planet
after
the
breakdown
when
the
handful
of
survivors
were
just
trying
to
exist
here
the
aliens
could
have
landed
and
moved
in
any
interference
could
have
been
wiped
out
once
the
population
began
to
grow
the
invaders
found
they
could
keep
control
by
staying
separate
so
their
alien
difference
be
noticed
why
should
that
bother
them
lea
asked
if
they
are
so
indifferent
to
death
they
ca
have
any
strong
thoughts
on
public
opinion
or
alien
body
odor
why
would
they
bother
with
such
a
complex
camouflage
and
if
they
arrived
from
another
planet
what
has
happened
to
the
scientific
ability
that
brought
them
here
peace
brion
said
i
do
know
enough
to
be
able
even
to
guess
at
answers
to
half
your
questions
i
just
trying
to
fit
a
theory
to
the
facts
and
the
facts
are
clear
the
magter
are
so
inhuman
they
would
give
me
nightmares
if
i
were
sleeping
these
days
what
we
need
is
more
evidence
then
get
it
lea
said
with
finality
i
not
telling
you
to
turn
murderer
but
you
might
try
a
bit
of
give
me
a
scalpel
and
one
of
your
friends
stretched
out
on
a
slab
and
quickly
tell
you
what
he
is
or
is
not
she
turned
back
to
the
microscope
and
bent
over
the
eyepiece
that
was
really
the
only
way
to
hack
the
gordian
knot
dis
had
only
more
hours
to
live
so
individual
deaths
should
be
of
any
concern
he
had
to
find
a
dead
magter
and
if
none
was
obtainable
in
the
proper
condition
he
had
to
get
one
of
them
by
violence
for
a
planetary
savior
he
was
personally
doing
in
an
awful
lot
of
the
citizenry
he
stood
behind
lea
looking
down
at
her
thoughtfully
while
she
worked
the
back
of
her
neck
lightly
covered
with
gently
curling
hair
was
turned
toward
him
with
one
of
the
shifts
the
mind
is
capable
of
his
thoughts
flipped
from
death
to
life
and
he
experienced
a
strong
desire
to
caress
this
spot
lightly
to
feel
the
yielding
texture
of
female
flesh
plunging
his
hands
deep
into
his
pockets
he
walked
quickly
to
the
door
get
some
rest
soon
he
called
to
her
i
doubt
if
those
bugs
will
give
you
the
answer
i
going
now
to
see
if
i
can
get
the
specimen
you
want
the
truth
could
be
anywhere
i
stay
on
these
until
you
come
back
she
said
not
looking
up
from
the
microscope
up
under
the
roof
was
a
communications
room
brion
had
taken
a
quick
look
at
it
when
he
had
first
toured
the
building
the
duty
operator
had
earphones
on
though
only
one
of
the
phones
covered
an
ear
and
was
monitoring
through
the
bands
his
shoeless
feet
were
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
he
was
eating
a
thick
sandwich
held
in
his
free
hand
his
eyes
bulged
when
he
saw
brion
in
the
doorway
and
he
jumped
into
a
flurry
of
action
hold
the
pose
brion
told
him
it
does
bother
me
and
if
you
make
any
sudden
moves
you
are
liable
to
break
a
phone
electrocute
yourself
or
choke
to
death
just
see
if
you
can
set
the
transceiver
on
this
frequency
for
me
brion
wrote
the
number
on
a
scratch
pad
and
slid
it
over
to
the
operator
it
was
the
frequency
krafft
had
given
him
for
the
radio
of
the
illegal
terrorists
the
nyjord
army
the
operator
plugged
in
a
handset
and
gave
it
to
brion
circuit
open
he
mumbled
around
a
mouthful
of
still
unswallowed
sandwich
this
is
brandd
director
of
the
come
in
please
he
went
on
repeating
this
for
more
than
ten
minutes
before
he
got
an
answer
do
you
want
i
have
a
message
of
vital
urgency
for
you
and
i
would
also
like
your
help
do
you
want
any
more
information
on
the
radio
wait
there
we
get
in
touch
with
you
after
the
carrier
wave
went
dead
hours
to
the
end
of
the
world
and
all
he
could
do
was
wait
xii
on
brion
desk
when
he
came
in
were
two
neat
piles
of
paper
as
he
sat
down
and
reached
for
them
he
was
conscious
of
an
arctic
coldness
in
the
air
a
frigid
blast
it
was
coming
from
the
grill
which
was
now
covered
by
welded
steel
bars
the
control
unit
was
sealed
shut
someone
was
either
being
very
funny
or
very
efficient
either
way
it
was
cold
brion
kicked
at
the
cover
plate
until
it
buckled
then
bent
it
aside
after
a
careful
look
into
the
interior
he
disconnected
one

shorted
it

was
rewarded
by
a
number
of
sputtering
cracks
and
a
quantity
of
smoke
the

moaned
and
expired
faussel
was
standing
in
the

with
more
papers
a
shocked
expression
on
his
face
what
do
you
have
there
brion
asked
faussel
managed
to
straighten
out
his
face
and
brought
the
folders
to
the
desk
arranging
them
on
the
piles
already
there
these
are
the
progress
reports
you
asked
for
from
all
units
details
to
date
conclusions
suggestions
et

and
the
other
pile
brion
pointed
offplanet
correspondence
commissary
invoices
requisitions
he
straightened
the
edges
of
the
stack
while
he
answered
daily
reports
hospital
log
his
voice
died
away
and
stopped
as
brion
carefully
pushed
the
stack
off
the
edge
of
the
desk
into
the
wastebasket
in
other
words
red
tape
brion
said
well
it
all
filed
one
by
one
the
progress
reports
followed
the
first
stack
into
the
basket
until
the
desk
was
clear
nothing
it
was
just
what
he
had
expected
but
there
had
always
been
the
off
chance
that
one
of
the
specialists
could
come
up
with
a
new
approach
they
had
they
were
all
too
busy
specializing
outside
the
sky
was
darkening
the
front
entrance
guard
had
been
told
to
let
in
anyone
who
came
asking
for
the
director
there
was
nothing
else
brion
could
do
until
the
nyjord
rebels
made
contact
irritation
bit
at
him
at
least
lea
was
doing
something
constructive
he
could
look
in
on
her
he
opened
the
door
to
the
lab
with
a
feeling
of
pleasant
anticipation
it
froze
and
shattered
instantly
her
microscope
was
hooded
and
she
was
gone
having
he
thought
or
in
the
the
hospital
was
on
the
floor
below
and
he
went
there
first
of
course
she
here
stine
grumbled
where
else
should
a
girl
in
her
condition
be
she
was
out
of
bed
long
enough
today
tomorrow
the
last
day
and
if
you
want
to
get
any
more
work
out
of
her
before
the
deadline
you
had
better
let
her
rest
tonight
better
let
the
whole
staff
rest
i
been
handing
out
tranquilizers
like
aspirin
all
day
they
falling
apart
the
world
falling
apart
how
is
lea
doing
considering
her
shape
she
fine
go
in
and
see
for
yourself
if
you
wo
take
my
word
for
it
i
have
other
patients
to
look
at
are
you
that
worried
doctor
of
course
i
am
i
just
as
prone
to
the
weakness
of
the
flesh
as
the
rest
of
you
we
sitting
on
a
ticking
bomb
and
i
do
like
it
i
do
my
job
as
long
as
it
is
necessary
but
i
also
be
damned
glad
to
see
the
ships
land
to
pull
us
out
the
only
skin
that
i
really
feel
emotionally
concerned
about
right
now
is
my
own
and
if
you
want
to
be
let
in
on
a
public
secret
the
rest
of
your
staff
feels
the
same
way
so
do
look
forward
to
too
much
efficiency
i
never
did
brion
said
to
the
retreating
back
lea
room
was
dark
illuminated
only
by
the
light
of
dis
moon
slanting
in
through
the
window
brion
let
himself
in
and
closed
the
door
behind
him
walking
quietly
he
went
over
to
the
bed
lea
was
sleeping
soundly
her
breathing
gentle
and
regular
a
night
sleep
now
would
do
as
much
good
as
all
the
medication
he
should
have
gone
then
instead
he
sat
down
in
the
chair
placed
next
to
the
head
of
the
bed
the
guards
knew
where
he
was
he
could
wait
here
just
as
well
as
any
place
else
it
was
a
stolen
moment
of
peace
on
a
world
at
the
brink
of
destruction
he
was
grateful
for
it
everything
looked
less
harsh
in
the
moonlight
and
he
rubbed
some
of
the
tension
from
his
eyes
lea
face
was
ironed
smooth
by
the
light
beautiful
and
young
a
direct
contrast
to
everything
else
on
this
poisonous
world
her
hand
was
outside
of
the
covers
and
he
took
it
in
his
own
obeying
a
sudden
impulse
looking
out
of
the
window
at
the
desert
in
the
distance
he
let
the
peace
wash
over
him
forcing
himself
to
forget
for
the
moment
that
in
one
more
day
life
would
be
stripped
from
this
planet
later
when
he
looked
back
at
lea
he
saw
that
her
eyes
were
open
though
she
had
moved
how
long
had
she
been
awake
he
jerked
his
hand
away
from
hers
feeling
suddenly
guilty
is
the
looking
after
the
serfs
to
see
if
they
fit
for
the
treadmills
in
the
morning
she
asked
it
was
the
kind
of
remark
she
had
used
with
such
frequency
in
the
ship
though
it
did
sound
quite
as
harsh
now
and
she
was
smiling
yet
it
reminded
him
too
well
of
her
superior
attitude
towards
rubes
from
the
stellar
sticks
here
he
might
be
the
director
but
on
ancient
earth
he
would
be
only
one
more
gaping
yokel
how
do
you
feel
he
asked
realizing
and
hating
the
triteness
of
the
words
even
as
he
said
them
terrible
i
be
dead
by
morning
reach
me
a
piece
of
fruit
from
that
bowl
will
you
my
mouth
tastes
like
an
old
boot
heel
i
wonder
how
fresh
fruit
ever
got
here
probably
a
gift
to
the
working
classes
from
the
smiling
planetary
murderers
on
nyjord
she
took
the
apple
brion
gave
her
and
bit
into
it
did
you
ever
think
of
going
to
earth
brion
was
startled
this
was
too
close
to
his
own
thoughts
about
planetary
backgrounds
there
could
possibly
be
a
connection
though
never
he
told
her
up
until
a
few
months
ago
i
never
even
considered
leaving
anvhar
the
twenties
are
such
a
big
thing
at
home
that
it
is
hard
to
imagine
that
anything
else
exists
while
you
are
still
taking
part
in
them
spare
me
the
twenties
she
pleaded
after
listening
to
you
and
ihjel
i
know
far
more
about
them
than
i
shall
ever
care
to
know
but
what
about
anvhar
itself
do
you
have
big
as
earth
does
nothing
like
that
for
its
size
it
has
a
very
small
population
no
big
cities
at
all
i
guess
the
largest
centers
of
population
are
around
the
schools
packing
plants
things
like
that
any
exobiologists
there
lea
asked
with
a
woman
eternal
ability
to
make
any
general
topic
personal
at
the
universities
i
suppose
though
i
would
know
for
sure
and
you
must
realize
that
when
i
say
no
big
cities
i
also
mean
no
little
cities
we
are
organized
that
way
at
all
i
imagine
the
basic
physical
unit
is
the
family
and
the
circle
of
friends
friends
get
important
quickly
since
the
family
breaks
up
when
children
are
still
relatively
young
something
in
the
genes
i
suppose
we
all
enjoy
being
alone
i
suppose
you
might
call
it
an
inbred
survival
trait
up
to
a
point
she
said
biting
delicately
into
the
apple
carry
that
sort
of
thing
too
far
and
you
end
up
with
no
population
at
all
a
certain
amount
of
proximity
is
necessary
for
that
of
course
it
is
and
there
must
be
some
form
of
recognized
relationship
or
control
that
or
complete
promiscuity
on
anvhar
the
emphasis
is
on
personal
responsibility
and
that
seems
to
take
care
of
the
problem
if
we
did
have
an
adult
way
of
looking
at
things
our
kind
of
life
would
be
impossible
individuals
are
brought
together
either
by
accident
or
design
and
with
this
proximity
must
be
some
certainty
of
relations
you
losing
me
lea
protested
either
i
still
foggy
from
the
dope
or
you
are
suddenly
unable
to
speak
a
word
of
less
than
four
syllables
you
know
whenever
this
happens
with
you
i
get
the
distinct
impression
that
you
are
trying
to
cover
up
something
for
occam
sake
be
specific
bring
me
together
two
of
these
hypothetical
individuals
and
tell
me
what
happens
brion
took
a
deep
breath
he
was
in
over
his
head
and
far
from
shore
well
take
a
bachelor
like
myself
since
i
like
skiing
i
make
my
home
in
this
big
house
our
family
has
right
at
the
edge
of
the
broken
hills
in
summer
i
looked
after
a
drumtum
herd
but
after
slaughtering
my
time
was
my
own
all
winter
i
did
a
lot
of
skiing
and
used
to
work
for
the
twenties
sometimes
i
would
go
visiting
then
again
people
would
drop
in
on
me
houses
are
few
and
far
between
on
anvhar
we
do
even
have
locks
on
our
doors
you
accept
and
give
hospitality
without
qualification
whoever
comes
male
female
in
groups
or
just
traveling
alone
i
get
the
drift
life
must
be
dull
for
a
single
girl
on
your
iceberg
planet
she
must
surely
have
to
stay
home
a
lot
only
if
she
wants
to
otherwise
she
can
go
wherever
she
wishes
and
be
welcomed
as
another
individual
i
suppose
it
is
out
of
fashion
in
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
and
would
probably
raise
a
big
laugh
on
earth
but
a
platonic
disinterested
friendship
between
man
and
woman
is
an
accepted
thing
on
anvhar
sounds
exceedingly
dull
if
you
are
all
such
cool
and
distant
friends
how
do
babies
get
made
brion
felt
his
ears
reddening
not
sure
if
he
was
being
teased
or
not
the
same
damn
way
they
get
made
any
place
else
but
it
not
just
a
reflexive
process
like
a
couple
of
rabbits
that
happen
to
meet
under
the
same
bush
it
the
woman
choice
to
indicate
if
she
is
interested
in
marriage
is
marriage
the
only
thing
your
women
are
interested
in
marriage
or
anything
else
that
up
to
the
girl
we
have
a
special
problem
on
anvhar
probably
the
same
thing
occurs
on
every
planet
where
the
human
race
has
made
a
massive
adaptation
not
all
unions
are
fertile
and
there
is
always
a
large
percentage
of
miscarriages
a
large
number
of
births
are
conceived
by
artificial
insemination
which
is
all
right
when
you
ca
have
babies
normally
but
most
women
have
an
emotional
bias
towards
having
their
husband
children
and
there
is
only
one
way
to
find
out
if
this
is
possible
lea
eyes
widened
are
you
suggesting
that
your
girls
see
if
a
man
can
father
children
considering
marriage
of
course
otherwise
anvhar
would
have
been
depopulated
centuries
ago
therefore
the
woman
does
the
choosing
if
she
is
interested
in
a
man
she
says
so
if
she
is
not
interested
the
man
would
never
think
of
suggesting
anything
it
a
lot
different
from
other
planets
but
so
is
our
planet
anvhar
it
works
well
for
us
which
is
the
only
test
that
applies
just
about
the
opposite
of
earth
lea
told
him
dropping
the
apple
core
into
a
dish
and
carefully
licking
the
tips
of
her
fingers
i
guess
you
anvharians
would
describe
earth
as
a
planetary
hotbed
of
sexuality
the
reverse
of
your
system
and
going
full
blast
all
the
time
there
are
far
too
many
people
there
for
comfort
birth
control
came
late
and
is
still
being
fought
if
you
can
possibly
imagine
that
there
are
just
too
many
of
the
archaic
religions
still
around
as
well
as
crackbrained
ideas
that
have
been
long
entrenched
in
custom
the
world
overcrowded
men
women
children
a
boiling
mob
wherever
you
look
and
all
of
the
physically
mature
ones
seem
to
be
involved
in
the
great
game
of
love
the
male
is
always
the
aggressor
not
physically
at
least
not
often
and
women
take
the
most
outrageous
kinds
of
flattery
for
granted
at
parties
there
are
always
a
couple
of
hot
breaths
of
passion
fanning
your
neck
a
girl
has
to
keep
her
spike
heels
filed
sharp
she
has
to
a
figure
of
speech
brion
meaning
you
fight
back
all
the
time
if
you
do
want
to
be
washed
under
by
the
flood
sounds
rather
brion
weighed
the
word
before
he
said
it
but
could
find
none
other
suitable
repellent
from
your
point
of
view
it
would
be
i
afraid
we
get
so
used
to
it
that
we
even
take
it
for
granted
sociologically
speaking
she
stopped
and
looked
at
brion
straight
back
and
almost
rigid
posture
her
eyes
widened
and
her
mouth
opened
in
an
unspoken
of
sudden
realization
i
being
a
fool
she
said
you
were
speaking
generally
at
all
you
had
a
very
specific
subject
in
mind
namely
please
lea
you
must
understand
but
i
do
she
laughed
all
the
time
i
thought
you
were
being
a
frigid
and
lump
of
ice
you
were
really
being
very
sweet
just
playing
the
game
in
good
old
anvharian
style
waiting
for
a
sign
from
me
we
still
be
playing
by
different
rules
if
you
had
had
more
sense
than
i
and
finally
realized
that
somewhere
along
the
line
we
must
have
got
our
signals
mixed
and
i
thought
you
were
some
kind
of
frosty
offworld
celibate
she
let
her
hand
go
out
and
her
fingers
rustled
through
his
hair
something
she
had
been
wanting
to
do
for
a
long
time
i
had
to
he
said
trying
to
ignore
the
light
touch
of
her
fingers
because
i
thought
so
much
of
you
i
could
have
done
anything
to
insult
you
such
as
forcing
my
attentions
on
you
until
i
began
to
worry
where
the
insult
would
lie
since
i
knew
nothing
about
your
planet
mores
well
you
know
now
she
said
very
softly
the
men
aggress
now
that
i
understand
i
think
i
like
your
way
better
but
i
still
not
sure
of
all
the
rules
do
i
explain
that
yes
brion
i
like
you
so
very
much
you
are
more
man
in
one
great
big
lump
than
i
have
ever
met
before
it
not
quite
the
time
or
the
place
to
discuss
marriage
but
i
would
certainly
like
his
arms
were
around
her
holding
her
to
him
her
hands
clasped
him
and
their
lips
sought
each
other
in
the
darkness
gently
she
whispered
i
bruise
easily
xiii
he
would
come
in
sir
just
hammered
on
the
door
and
said
here
tell
good
enough
brion
said
fitting
his
gun
in
the
holster
and
sliding
the
extra
clips
into
his
pocket
i
going
out
now
and
i
should
return
before
dawn
get
one
of
the
wheeled
stretchers
down
here
from
the
hospital
i
want
it
waiting
when
i
get
back
outside
the
street
was
darker
than
he
remembered
brion
frowned
and
his
hand
moved
towards
his
gun
someone
had
put
all
the
nearby
lights
out
of
commission
there
was
just
enough
illumination
from
the
stars
to
enable
him
to
make
out
the
dark
bulk
of
a
sand
car
brion
brandd
a
voice
spoke
harshly
from
the
car
get
in
the
motor
roared
as
soon
as
he
had
closed
the
door
without
lights
the
sand
car
churned
a
path
through
the
city
and
out
into
the
desert
though
the
speed
picked
up
the
driver
still
drove
in
the
dark
feeling
his
way
with
a
light
touch
on
the
controls
the
ground
rose
and
when
they
reached
the
top
of
a
mesa
he
killed
the
engine
neither
the
driver
nor
brion
had
spoken
a
word
since
they
left
a
switch
snapped
and
the
instrument
lights
came
on
in
their
dim
glow
brion
could
just
make
out
the
other
man
hawklike
profile
when
he
moved
brion
saw
that
his
figure
was
cruelly
shortened
either
accident
or
a
mutated
gene
had
warped
his
spine
hunching
him
forward
in
eternally
bent
supplication
warped
bodies
were
rare
his
was
the
first
brion
had
ever
seen
he
wondered
what
series
of
events
had
kept
him
from
medical
attention
all
his
life
this
might
explain
the
bitterness
and
pain
in
the
man
voice
did
the
mighty
brains
on
nyjord
bother
to
tell
you
that
they
have
chopped
another
day
off
the
deadline
the
man
asked
that
this
world
is
about
to
come
to
an
end
yes
i
know
brion
said
that
why
i
asking
your
group
for
help
our
time
is
running
out
too
fast
the
man
did
answer
he
merely
grunted
and
gave
his
full
attention
to
the
radar
pings
and
glowing
screen
the
electronic
senses
reached
out
as
he
made
a
check
on
all
the
search
frequencies
to
see
if
they
were
being
followed
where
are
we
going
brion
asked
out
into
the
desert
the
driver
made
a
vague
wave
of
his
hand
headquarters
of
the
army
since
the
whole
thing
will
be
blown
up
in
another
day
i
guess
i
can
tell
you
it
the
only
camp
we
have
all
the
cars
men
and
weapons
are
based
there
and
hys
he
the
man
in
charge
tomorrow
it
will
be
all
gone
along
with
this
cursed
planet
what
your
business
with
us
should
i
be
telling
hys
that
suit
yourself
satisfied
with
the
instrument
search
the
driver
kicked
the
car
to
life
again
and
churned
on
across
the
desert
but
we
a
volunteer
army
and
we
have
no
secrets
from
each
other
just
from
the
fools
at
home
who
are
going
to
kill
this
world
there
was
a
bitterness
in
his
words
that
he
made
no
attempt
to
conceal
they
fought
among
themselves
and
put
off
a
firm
decision
so
long
that
now
they
are
forced
to
commit
murder
from
what
i
had
heard
i
thought
that
it
was
the
other
way
around
they
call
your
nyjord
army
terrorists
we
are
because
we
are
an
army
and
we
at
war
the
idealists
at
home
only
understood
that
when
it
was
too
late
if
they
had
backed
us
in
the
beginning
we
would
have
blown
open
every
black
castle
on
dis
searched
until
we
found
those
bombs
but
that
would
have
meant
wanton
destruction
and
death
they
would
consider
that
now
they
are
going
to
kill
everyone
destroy
everything
he
flicked
on
the
panel
lights
just
long
enough
to
take
a
compass
bearing
and
brion
saw
the
tortured
unhappiness
in
his
twisted
body
it
not
over
yet
brion
said
there
is
more
than
a
day
left
and
i
think
i
onto
something
that
might
stop
the
war
without
any
bombs
being
dropped
you
in
charge
of
the
cultural
relationships
free
bread
and
blankets
foundation
are
you
what
good
can
your
bunch
do
when
the
shooting
starts
none
but
maybe
we
can
put
off
the
shooting
if
you
are
trying
to
insult
me
do
bother
my
irritation
quotient
is
very
high
the
driver
merely
grunted
at
this
slowing
down
as
they
ran
through
a
field
of
broken
rock
what
is
it
you
want
he
asked
we
want
to
make
a
detailed
examination
of
one
of
the
magter
alive
or
dead
it
does
make
any
difference
you
would
happen
to
have
one
around
no
we
fought
with
them
often
enough
but
always
on
their
home
grounds
they
keep
all
their
casualties
and
a
good
number
of
ours
what
good
will
it
do
you
anyway
a
dead
one
wo
tell
you
where
the
bombs
or
the
projector
is
i
do
see
why
i
should
explain
that
to
you
unless
you
are
in
charge
you
are
hys
are
you
the
driver
gave
an
angry
sound
and
then
was
silent
while
he
drove
finally
he
asked
what
makes
you
think
that
call
it
a
hunch
you
do
act
very
much
like
a
driver
for
one
thing
of
course
your
army
may
be
all
generals
and
no
privates
but
i
doubt
it
i
also
know
that
time
has
almost
run
out
for
all
of
us
this
is
a
long
ride
and
it
would
be
a
complete
waste
of
time
if
you
just
sat
out
in
the
desert
and
waited
for
me
by
driving
me
yourself
you
could
make
your
mind
up
before
we
arrived
could
have
a
decision
ready
as
to
whether
you
are
going
to
help
me
or
not
are
you
yes
i
hys
but
you
still
have
answered
my
question
what
do
you
want
the
body
for
we
going
to
cut
it
open
and
take
a
good
long
look
i
do
think
the
magter
are
human
they
are
something
living
among
men
and
disguised
as
men
but
still
not
human
secret
aliens
hys
exploded
the
words
in
a
mixture
of
surprise
and
disgust
perhaps
the
examination
will
tell
us
that
you
either
stupid
or
incompetent
hys
said
bitterly
the
heat
of
dis
has
cooked
your
brains
in
your
head
i
be
no
part
of
this
kind
of
absurd
plan
you
must
brion
said
surprised
at
his
own
calmness
he
could
sense
the
other
man
interest
hidden
behind
his
insulting
manner
i
do
even
have
to
give
you
my
reasons
in
another
day
this
world
ends
and
you
have
no
way
to
stop
it
i
just
might
have
an
idea
that
could
work
and
you
ca
afford
to
take
any
chances
not
if
you
are
really
sincere
either
you
are
a
murderer
killing
disans
for
pleasure
or
you
honestly
want
to
stop
the
war
which
is
it
you
have
your
body
all
right
hys
grated
hurling
the
car
viciously
around
a
spire
of
rock
not
that
it
will
accomplish
anything
but
i
can
find
no
fault
with
killing
another
magter
we
can
fit
your
operation
into
our
plans
without
any
trouble
this
is
the
last
night
and
i
have
sent
every
one
of
my
teams
out
on
raids
we
breaking
into
as
many
magter
towers
as
possible
before
dawn
there
is
a
slim
chance
that
we
might
uncover
something
it
really
just
shooting
in
the
dark
but
it
all
we
can
do
now
my
own
team
is
waiting
and
you
can
ride
along
with
us
the
others
left
earlier
we
going
to
hit
a
small
tower
on
this
side
of
the
city
we
raided
it
once
before
and
captured
a
lot
of
small
arms
they
had
stored
there
there
is
a
good
chance
that
they
may
have
been
stupid
enough
to
store
something
there
again
sometimes
the
magter
seem
to
suffer
from
a
complete
lack
of
imagination
you
have
no
idea
just
how
right
you
are
brion
told
him
the
sand
car
slowed
down
now
as
they
approached
a
mesa
that
rose
vertically
from
the
desert
they
crunched
across
broken
rocks
leaving
no
tracks
a
light
blinked
on
the
dashboard
and
hys
stopped
instantly
and
killed
the
engine
they
climbed
out
stretching
and
shivering
in
the
cold
desert
night
it
was
dark
walking
in
the
shadow
of
the
cliff
and
they
had
to
feel
their
way
along
a
path
through
the
tumbled
boulders
a
sudden
blaze
of
light
made
brion
wince
and
shield
his
eyes
near
him
on
the
ground
was
the
humming
shape
of
a
cancellation
projector
sending
out
a
curtain
of
vibration
that
absorbed
all
the
light
rays
falling
upon
it
this
incredible
blackness
made
a
lightproof
wall
for
the
recessed
hollow
at
the
foot
of
the
cliff
in
this
shelter
under
the
overhang
of
rock
were
three
open
sand
cars
they
were
large
and
warlike
in
their
scarred
grey
paint
men
sprawled
talked
and
polished
their
weapons
everything
stopped
when
hys
and
brion
appeared
load
up
hys
called
out
we
going
to
attack
now
same
plan
i
outlined
earlier
get
telt
over
here
in
talking
to
his
own
men
some
of
the
harshness
was
gone
from
his
voice
the
tall
soldiers
of
nyjord
moved
in
ready
obeyance
of
their
commander
they
loomed
over
his
bent
figure
most
of
them
twice
as
tall
as
he
but
there
was
no
hesitation
in
jumping
when
he
commanded
they
were
the
body
of
the
nyjord
striking
force
he
was
the
brains
a
compact
man
rolled
up
to
hys
and
saluted
with
a
leisurely
flick
of
his
hand
he
was
weighted
and
slung
about
with
packs
and
electronic
instruments
his
pockets
bulged
with
small
tools
and
spare
parts
this
is
telt
hys
said
to
brion
he
take
care
of
you
my
personal
technical
squad
he
goes
along
on
all
my
operations
with
his
meters
to
test
the
interiors
of
the
disan
forts
so
far
found
no
trace
of
a
generator
or
excess
radioactivity
that
might
indicate
a
bomb
since
he
useless
and
you
useless
you
both
take
care
of
each
other
use
the
car
we
came
in
telt
wide
face
split
in
a
froglike
grin
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
throaty
wait
just
wait
someday
those
needles
gon
na
flicker
and
all
our
troubles
be
over
what
you
want
me
to
do
with
the
stranger
supply
him
with
a
corpse
one
of
the
magter
hys
said
take
it
wherever
he
wants
and
then
report
back
here
hys
scowled
at
telt
someday
your
needles
will
flicker
poor
fool
this
is
the
last
day
he
turned
away
and
waved
the
men
into
their
sand
cars
he
likes
me
telt
said
attaching
a
final
piece
of
equipment
you
can
tell
because
he
calls
me
names
like
that
he
a
great
man
hys
is
but
they
never
found
out
until
it
was
too
late
hand
me
that
meter
will
you
brion
followed
the
technician
out
to
the
car
and
helped
him
load
his
equipment
aboard
when
the
larger
cars
appeared
out
of
the
darkness
telt
swung
around
after
them
they
snaked
forward
in
a
single
line
through
the
rocks
until
they
came
to
the
desert
of
rolling
sand
dunes
then
they
spread
out
in
line
abreast
and
rushed
towards
their
goal
telt
hummed
to
himself
hoarsely
as
he
drove
he
broke
off
suddenly
and
looked
at
brion
what
you
want
the
dead
dis
for
a
theory
brion
answered
sluggishly
he
had
been
half
napping
in
the
chair
taking
the
opportunity
for
some
rest
before
the
attack
i
still
looking
for
a
way
to
avert
the
end
you
and
hys
telt
said
with
satisfaction
couple
of
idealists
trying
to
stop
a
war
you
did
start
they
never
would
listen
to
hys
he
told
them
in
the
beginning
exactly
what
would
happen
and
he
was
right
they
always
thought
his
ideas
were
crooked
like
him
growing
up
alone
in
the
hill
camp
with
his
back
too
twisted
and
too
old
to
be
fixed
when
he
finally
did
come
out
ideas
twisted
the
same
way
made
himself
an
authority
on
war
hah
war
on
nyjord
like
being
an
specialist
in
hell
but
he
knew
all
about
it
though
they
never
would
let
him
use
what
he
knew
put
granddaddy
krafft
in
charge
instead
but
hys
is
in
charge
of
an
army
now
all
volunteers
too
few
of
them
and
too
little
money
too
little
and
too
damned
late
to
do
any
good
i
tell
you
we
did
our
best
but
it
could
never
be
good
enough
and
for
this
we
get
called
butchers
there
was
a
catch
in
telt
voice
now
an
undercurrent
of
emotion
he
could
suppress
at
home
they
think
we
like
to
kill
think
we
insane
they
ca
understand
we
doing
the
only
thing
that
has
to
be
done
he
broke
off
as
he
quickly
locked
on
the
brakes
and
killed
the
engine
the
line
of
sand
cars
had
come
to
a
stop
ahead
just
visible
over
the
dunes
was
the
summit
of
a
dark
tower
we
walk
from
here
telt
said
standing
and
stretching
we
can
take
our
time
because
the
other
boys
go
in
first
soften
things
up
then
you
and
i
head
for
the
for
a
radiation
check
and
find
you
a
handsome
corpse
walking
at
first
then
crawling
when
the
dunes
no
longer
shielded
them
they
crept
up
on
the
disan
keep
dark
figures
moved
ahead
of
them
stopping
only
when
they
reached
the
crumbling
black
walls
they
did
use
the
ascending
ramp
but
made
their
way
up
the
sheer
outside
face
of
the
ramparts

whispered
anchor

when
the
missile

some
kind
of
goo
then
we
go
up
the
filament
with
a
motor

invented

that
the
way
you
and
i
are
going
in
brion
asked
no
we
get
out
of
the
climbing
i
told
you
we
hit
this
rock
once
before
i
know
the
layout
inside
he
was
moving
while
he
talked
carefully
pacing
the
distance
around
the
base
of
the
tower

be
right
about
here
keening
sliced
the
air
and
the
top
of
the
magter
building
burst
into
flame
automatic
weapons
hammered
above
them
something
fell
silently
through
the
night
and
hit
heavily
on
the
ground
near
them

started
telt
shouted
we
have
to
get
through
now
while
all
the
creepies
are
fighting
it
out
on
top
he
pulled
a
object
from
one
of
his
bags
and
slapped
it
hard
against
the
wall
it
hung
there
he
twisted
the
back
of
it
pulled
something
and
waved
brion
to
the
ground
shaped
charge
should
blow
straight
in
but
you
never
can
tell
the
ground
jumped
under
them
and
the
ringing
thud
was
a
giant
fist
punching
through
the
wall
a
cloud
of
dust
and
smoke
rolled
clear
and
they
could
see
the
dark
opening
in
the
rock
a
tunnel
driven
into
the
wall
by
the
directional
force
of
the
explosion
telt
shone
a
light
through
the
hole
at
the
crumbled
chamber
inside
nothing
to
worry
about
from
anybody
who
was
leaning
against
this
wall
but
let
get
in
and
out
of
this
black
beehive
before
the
ones
upstairs
come
down
to
investigate
shattered
rock
was
thick
on
the
floor
and
they
skidded
and
tumbled
over
it
telt
pointed
the
way
with
his
light
down
a
sharply
angled
ramp
underground
chambers
in
the
rock
they
always
store
their
stuff
down
there
a
smoking
black
sphere
arced
out
of
the
tunnel

hitting
at
their
feet

just
gaped
but
even
as
it
hit
the
floor
brion
was
jumping
forward
he
caught
it
with
the
side
of
his
foot
kicking
it
back
into
the
dark
opening
of
the
tunnel
telt
hit
the
ground
next
to
him
as
the
orange
flame
of
an
explosion
burst
below
bits
of
shrapnel
rattled
from
the
ceiling
and

behind
them
grenades

gasped
they
only
used
them
once
before

many
got
ta
warn

he
plugged
a
throat
mike
into
the
transmitter
on
his
tack
and
spoke
quickly
into
it
there
was
a
stirring
below
and
brion
poured
a
rain
of
fire
into
the
tunnel
they
catching
it
bad
on
top
too
we
got
ta
pull
out

first

i
cover

one

crazy
you
dead
if
you
stay
telt
was
scrambling
back
towards
the
crumbled
entrance
as
he
talked
his
back
was
turned
when
brion
fired
the
magter
had
appeared
silently
as
the
shadow
of
death
they
charged
without
a
sound
running
with
expressionless
faces
into
the
bullets
two
died
at
once
curling
and
folding
the
third
one
fell
at
brion
feet
shot
pierced
dying
but
not
yet
dead
leaving
a
crimson
track
it
hunched
closer
lifting
its
knife
to
brion
he
did
move
how
many
times
must
you
murder
a
man
or
was
it
a
man
his
mind
and
body
rebelled
against
the
killing
and
he
was
almost
ready
to
accept
death
himself
rather
than
kill
again
telt
bullets
tore
through
the
body
and
it
dropped
with
grim
finality
there
your
corpse
now
get
it
out
of
here
telt
screeched
between
them
they
worked
the
sodden
weight
of
the
dead
magter
through
the
hole
their
exposed
backs
crawling
with
the
expectation
of
instant
death
no
further
attack
came
as
they
ran
from
the
tower
other
than
a
grenade
that
exploded
too
far
behind
them
to
do
any
harm
one
of
the
armored
sand
cars
circled
the
keep
headlights
blazing
keeping
up
a
steady
fire
from
its
heavy
weapons
the
attackers
climbed
into
it
as
they
beat
a
retreat

and
brion
dragged
the
disan
behind
them
struggling
through
the
loose
sand
towards
the
circling
car
telt
glanced
over
his
shoulder
and
broke
into
a
shambling
run

following
us
he
gasped
the
first
time
they
ever
chased
us
after
a
raid
they
must
know
we
have
the
body

said
leave
it
behind

choked
too
heavy
to
carry
anyway
i
rather
leave
you

said
sharply
let
me
have
it
he
pulled
the
corpse
away
from
the
unresisting
telt
and
heaved
it
across
his
own
shoulders

your
gun
to
cover
us

a
rain
of
slugs
back
towards

have
seen
the
flare
of
their
fire
because
the
truck
turned
and
started
towards
them
it
braked
in
a
choking
cloud
of
dust
and
ready
hands
reached
to
pull
them
up
brion
pushed
the
body
in
ahead
of
himself
and
scrambled
after
it
the
truck
engine
throbbed
and
they
churned
away
into
the
blackness
away
from
the
gutted
tower
you
know
that
was
more
like
kind
of
a
joke
when
i
said
i
leave
the
corpse
behind
telt
told
brion
you
did
believe
me
did
you
yes
brion
said
holding
the
dead
weight
of
the
magter
against
the
truck
side
i
thought
you
meant
it
ahhh
telt
protested
you
as
bad
as
hys
you
take
things
too
seriously
brion
suddenly
realized
that
he
was
wet
with
blood
his
clothing
sodden
his
stomach
rose
at
the
thought
and
he
clutched
the
edge
of
the
sand
car
killing
like
this
was
too
personal
talking
abstractedly
about
a
body
was
one
thing
but
murdering
a
man
then
lifting
his
dead
flesh
and
feeling
his
blood
warm
upon
you
is
an
entirely
different
matter
but
the
magter
were
human
he
knew
that
the
thought
was
only
mildly
comforting
after
they
had
reached
the
other
waiting
sand
cars
the
raiding
party
split
up
each
one
goes
in
a
different
direction
telt
said
so
they
ca
track
us
to
the
base
he
clipped
a
piece
of
paper
next
to
the
compass
and
kicked
the
motor
into
life
we
make
a
big
u
in
the
desert
and
end
up
in
hovedstad
i
got
the
course
here
then
i
dump
you
and
your
friends
and
beat
it
back
to
our
camp
you
not
still
burned
at
me
for
what
i
said
are
you
are
you
brion
did
answer
he
was
staring
fixedly
out
of
the
side
window
what
doing
telt
asked
brion
pointed
out
at
the
rushing
darkness
over
there
he
said
pointing
to
the
growing
light
on
the
horizon
dawn
telt
said
lotta
rain
on
your
planet
did
you
ever
see
the
sun
come
up
before
not
on
the
last
day
of
a
world
lock
it
up
telt
grumbled
you
give
me
the
crawls
i
know
going
to
be
blasted
but
at
least
i
know
i
did
everything
i
could
to
stop
it
how
do
you
think
they
are
going
to
be
feeling
at
home
on
nyjord
from
tomorrow
on
maybe
we
can
still
stop
it
brion
said
shrugging
off
the
feeling
of
gloom
telt
only
answer
was
a
wordless
sound
of
disgust
by
the
time
they
had
cut
a
large
loop
in
the
desert
the
sun
was
well
up
in
the
sky
the
daily
heat
begun
their
course
took
them
through
a
chain
of
low
flinty
hills
that
cut
their
speed
almost
to
zero
they
ground
ahead
in
low
gear
while
telt
sweated
and
cursed
struggling
with
the
controls
then
they
were
on
firm
sand
and
picking
up
speed
towards
the
city
as
soon
as
brion
saw
hovedstad
clearly
he
felt
a
clutch
of
fear
from
somewhere
in
the
city
a
black
plume
of
smoke
was
rising
it
could
have
been
one
of
the
deserted
buildings
aflame
a
minor
blaze
yet
the
closer
they
came
the
greater
his
tension
grew
brion
dare
put
it
into
words
himself
it
was
telt
who
vocalized
the
thought
a
fire
or
something
coming
from
your
area
somewhere
close
to
your
building
within
the
city
they
saw
the
first
signs
of
destruction
broken
rubble
on
the
streets
the
smell
of
greasy
smoke
in
their
nostrils
more
and
more
people
appeared
going
in
the
same
direction
they
were
the
normally
deserted
streets
of
hovedstad
were
now
almost
crowded
disans
obvious
by
their
bare
shoulders
mixed
with
the
few
offworlders
who
still
remained
brion
made
sure
the
tarpaulin
was
well
wrapped
around
the
body
before
they
pushed
the
sand
car
slowly
through
the
growing
crowd
i
do
like
all
this
publicity
telt
complained
looking
at
the
people
it
the
last
day
or
i
be
turning
back
they
know
our
cars
we
raided
them
often
enough
turning
a
corner
he
braked
suddenly
mouth
agape
ahead
was
destruction
black
broken
rubble
had
been
churned
into
desolation
it
was
still
smoking
pink
tongues
of
flame
licking
over
the
ruins
a
fragment
of
wall
fell
with
a
rumbling
crash
it
your
building
the
foundation
building
telt
shouted
they
been
here
ahead
of
us
must
have
used
the
radio
to
call
a
raid
they
did
a
job
explosive
of
some
kind
hope
was
dead
dis
was
dead
in
the
ruin
ahead
mixed
and
broken
with
other
rubble
were
the
bodies
of
all
the
people
who
had
trusted
him
lea
beautiful
and
cruelly
dead
lea
doctor
stine
his
patients
faussel
all
of
them
he
had
kept
them
on
this
planet
and
now
they
were
dead
every
one
of
them
dead
murderer
xiv
life
was
ended
brion
mind
contained
nothing
but
despair
and
the
pain
of
irretrievable
loss
if
his
brain
had
been
completely
the
master
of
his
body
he
would
have
died
there
for
at
that
moment
there
was
no
will
to
live
unaware
of
this
his
heart
continued
to
beat
and
the
regular
motion
of
his
lungs
drew
in
the
dreadful
sweetness
of
the
air
with
automatic
directness
his
body
lived
on
what
you
gon
na
do
telt
asked
even
his
natural
exuberation
stilled
by
this
brion
only
shook
his
head
as
the
words
penetrated
what
could
he
do
what
could
possibly
be
done
follow
me
a
voice
said
in
guttural
disan
through
the
opening
of
a
rear
window
the
speaker
was
lost
in
the
crowd
before
they
could
turn
aware
now
brion
saw
a
native
move
away
from
the
edge
of
the
crowd
and
turn
to
look
in
their
direction
it
was
ulv
turn
the
car
that
way
he
punched
telt
arm
and
pointed
do
it
slowly
and
do
draw
any
attention
to
us
for
a
moment
there
was
hope
which
he
kept
himself
from
considering
the
building
was
gone
and
the
people
in
it
all
dead
that
fact
had
to
be
faced
what
going
on
telt
asked
who
was
that
talked
in
the
window
a
native
that
one
up
ahead
he
saved
my
life
in
the
desert
and
i
think
he
is
on
our
side
even
though
he
a
native
disan
he
can
understand
facts
that
the
magter
ca
he
knows
what
will
happen
to
this
planet
brion
was
talking
to
fill
his
brain
with
words
so
he
would
begin
to
have
hope
there
was
no
hope
possible
ulv
moved
slowly
and
naturally
through
the
streets
never
looking
back
they
followed
as
far
behind
as
they
dared
yet
still
keeping
him
in
sight
fewer
people
were
about
here
among
the
deserted
offworld
storehouses
ulv
vanished
into
one
of
these
light
metals
trust
the
sign
read
above
the
door
telt
slowed
the
car
do
stop
here
brion
said
drive
around
the
corner
and
pull
up
brion
climbed
out
of
the
car
with
an
ease
he
did
not
feel
no
one
was
in
sight
now
in
either
direction
walking
slowly
back
to
the
corner
he
checked
the
street
they
had
just
left
hot
silent
and
empty
a
sudden
blackness
appeared
where
the
door
of
the
warehouse
had
been
and
the
sudden
flickering
motion
of
a
hand
brion
signaled
telt
to
start
and
jumped
into
the
already
moving
sand
car
into
that
open
door
quickly
before
anyone
sees
us
the
car
rumbled
down
a
ramp
into
the
dark
interior
and
the
door
slid
shut
behind
them
ulv
what
is
it
where
are
you
brion
called
blinking
in
the
murky
interior
a
grey
form
appeared
beside
him
i
am
here
did
you
there
was
no
way
to
finish
the
sentence
i
heard
of
the
raid
the
magter
called
together
all
of
us
they
could
to
help
them
carry
explosive
i
went
along
i
could
not
stop
them
and
there
was
no
time
to
warn
anyone
in
the
building
then
they
are
all
dead
yes
ulv
nodded
all
except
one
i
knew
i
could
perhaps
save
one
i
was
not
sure
who
so
i
took
the
woman
you
were
with
in
the
desert
she
is
here
now
she
was
hurt
but
not
badly
when
i
brought
her
out
guilty
relief
flooded
through
brion
he
should
exult
not
with
the
death
of
everyone
in
the
foundation
still
fresh
in
his
mind
but
at
that
instant
he
was
happy
let
me
see
her
he
said
to
ulv
he
was
seized
by
the
sudden
fear
that
there
might
be
a
mistake
perhaps
ulv
had
saved
a
different
woman
ulv
led
the
way
across
the
empty
loading
bay
brion
followed
closely
fighting
down
the
temptation
to
tell
him
to
hurry
when
he
saw
that
ulv
was
heading
towards
an
office
in
the
far
wall
he
could
control
himself
no
longer
and
ran
on
ahead
it
was
lea
lying
unconscious
on
a
couch
sweat
beaded
her
face
and
she
moaned
and
stirred
without
opening
her
eyes
i
gave
her
then
wrapped
her
in
cloth
so
no
one
would
know
ulv
said
telt
was
close
behind
them
looking
in
through
the
open
door
is
a
drug
they
take
from
one
of
their
plants
he
said
we
got
a
lot
of
experience
with
it
a
little
makes
a
good
drug
but
it
deadly
poison
in
large
doses
i
got
the
antidote
in
the
car
wait
and
i
get
it
he
went
out
brion
sat
next
to
lea
and
wiped
her
face
clean
of
dirt
and
perspiration
the
dark
shadows
under
her
eyes
were
almost
black
now
and
her
elfin
face
seemed
even
thinner
but
she
was
alive
that
was
the
important
thing
some
of
the
tension
drained
away
from
brion
and
he
could
think
again
there
was
still
the
job
to
do
after
this
last
experience
lea
should
be
in
a
hospital
bed
but
this
was
impossible
he
would
have
to
drag
her
to
her
feet
and
put
her
back
to
work
the
answer
might
still
be
found
each
second
ticked
away
another
fraction
of
the
planet
life
good
as
new
in
a
minute
telt
said
banging
down
the
heavy
med
box
he
watched
intently
as
ulv
left
the
room
hys
should
know
about
this
renegade
might
be
useful
as
a
spy
or
for
information
though
of
course
it
too
late
now
to
do
anything
so
the
hell
with
it
he
pulled
a
hypodermic
gun
from
the
box
and
dialed
a
number
on
the
side
now
if
you
roll
her
sleeve
up
i
bring
her
back
to
life
he
pressed
the
sterilizing
muzzle
against
her
skin
and
pulled
the
trigger
the
hypo
gun
hummed
briefly
ending
its
cycle
with
a
loud
click
does
it
work
fast
brion
asked
couple
of
minutes
just
let
her
be
and
she
come
to
by
herself
ulv
was
in
the
doorway
killer
he
hissed
his
blowgun
was
in
his
hand
half
raised
to
his
mouth
he
been
in
the
car
he
seen
it
telt
shouted
and
grabbed
for
his
gun
brion
sprang
between
them
raising
his
hands
stop
it
no
more
killing
he
shouted
in
disan
then
he
shook
his
fist
at
telt
fire
that
gun
and
i
stuff
it
down
your
throat
i
handle
this
he
turned
to
face
ulv
who
had
brought
the
blowgun
any
closer
to
his
lips
this
was
a
good
sign
the
disan
was
still
uncertain
you
have
seen
the
body
in
the
car
ulv
so
you
must
have
seen
that
it
is
that
of
a
magter
i
killed
him
myself
because
i
would
rather
kill
one
or
ten
or
even
a
hundred
men
than
have
everyone
on
this
planet
destroyed
i
killed
him
in
a
fair
fight
and
now
i
am
going
to
examine
his
body
there
is
something
very
strange
and
different
about
the
magter
you
know
that
yourself
if
i
can
find
out
what
it
is
perhaps
we
can
make
them
stop
this
war
and
not
bomb
nyjord
ulv
was
still
angry
but
he
lowered
the
blowgun
a
little
i
wish
there
were
no
offworlders
he
said
i
wish
that
none
of
you
had
ever
come
nothing
was
wrong
until
you
started
coming
the
magter
were
the
strongest
and
they
killed
but
they
also
helped
now
they
want
to
fight
a
war
with
your
weapons
and
for
this
you
are
going
to
kill
my
world
and
you
want
me
to
help
you
not
me
yourself
brion
said
wearily
there
no
going
back
that
the
one
thing
we
ca
do
maybe
dis
would
have
been
better
off
without
offplanet
contact
maybe
not
in
any
case
you
have
to
forget
about
that
you
have
contact
now
with
the
rest
of
the
galaxy
for
better
or
for
worse
you
got
a
problem
to
solve
and
i
here
to
help
you
solve
it
seconds
ticked
by
as
ulv
unmoving
fought
with
questions
that
were
novel
to
his
life
could
killing
stop
death
could
he
help
his
people
by
helping
strangers
to
fight
and
kill
them
his
world
had
changed
and
he
did
like
it
he
must
make
a
giant
effort
to
change
with
it
abruptly
he
pushed
the
blowgun
into
a
thong
at
his
waist
turned
and
strode
out
too
much
for
my
nerves
telt
said
settling
his
gun
back
in
the
holster
you
do
know
how
happy
i
gon
na
be
when
this
whole
damn
thing
is
over
even
if
the
planet
goes
bang
i
do
care
finished
he
walked
out
to
the
sand
car
keeping
a
careful
eye
on
the
disan
crouched
against
the
wall
brion
turned
back
to
lea
whose
eyes
were
open
staring
at
the
ceiling
he
went
to
her
running
she
said
and
her
voice
had
a
toneless
emptiness
that
screamed
louder
than
any
emotion
they
ran
by
the
open
door
of
my
room
and
i
could
see
them
when
they
killed
stine
just
butchered
him
like
an
animal
chopping
him
down
then
one
came
into
the
room
and
that
all
i
remember
she
turned
her
head
slowly
and
looked
at
brion
what
happened
why
am
i
here
they
dead
he
told
her
all
of
them
after
the
raid
the
disans
blew
up
the
building
you
the
only
one
that
survived
that
was
ulv
who
came
into
your
room
the
disan
we
met
in
the
desert
he
brought
you
away
and
hid
you
here
in
the
city
when
do
we
leave
she
asked
in
the
same
empty
tones
turning
her
face
to
the
wall
when
do
we
get
off
this
planet
today
is
the
last
day
the
deadline
is
midnight
krafft
will
have
a
ship
pick
us
up
when
we
are
ready
but
we
still
have
our
job
to
do
i
got
that
body
you
going
to
have
to
examine
it
we
must
find
out
about
the
magter
nothing
can
be
done
now
except
leave
her
voice
was
a
dull
monotone
there
is
only
so
much
that
a
person
can
do
and
i
done
it
please
have
the
ship
come
i
want
to
leave
now
brion
bit
his
lip
in
helpless
frustration
nothing
seemed
to
penetrate
the
apathy
into
which
she
had
sunk
too
much
shock
too
much
terror
in
too
short
a
time
he
took
her
chin
in
his
hand
and
turned
her
head
to
face
him
she
did
resist
but
her
eyes
were
shining
with
tears
tears
trickled
down
her
cheeks
take
me
home
brion
please
take
me
home
he
could
only
brush
her
sodden
hair
back
from
her
face
and
force
himself
to
smile
at
her
the
moments
of
time
were
running
out
faster
and
faster
and
he
no
longer
knew
what
to
do
the
examination
had
to
be
made
yet
he
could
force
her
he
looked
for
the
med
box
and
saw
that
telt
had
taken
it
back
to
the
sand
car
there
might
be
something
in
it
that
could
help
a
tranquilizer
perhaps
telt
had
some
of
his
instruments
open
on
the
chart
table
and
was
examining
a
tape
with
a
pocket
magnifier
when
brion
entered
he
jumped
nervously
and
put
the
tape
behind
his
back
then
relaxed
when
he
saw
who
it
was
i
thought
you
were
the
creepie
out
there
coming
for
a
look
he
whispered
maybe
you
trust
him
but
i
ca
afford
to
ca
even
use
the
radio
i
getting
out
of
here
now
i
have
to
tell
hys
tell
him
what
brion
asked
sharply
what
is
all
the
mystery
about
telt
handed
him
the
magnifier
and
tape
look
at
that
recording
tape
from
my
scintillation
counter
red
verticals
are
intervals
the
wiggly
black
horizontal
line
is
the
radioactivity
level
all
this
where
the
line
goes
up
and
down
that
when
we
were
driving
out
to
the
attack
varying
hot
level
of
the
rock
and
ground
what
the
big
peak
in
the
middle
that
coincides
exactly
with
our
visit
to
the
house
of
horrors
when
we
went
through
the
hole
in
the
bottom
of
the
tower
he
could
keep
the
excitement
out
of
his
voice
does
it
mean
that
i
do
know
i
not
sure
i
have
to
compare
it
with
the
other
tapes
back
at
base
it
could
be
the
stone
of
the
tower
some
of
these
heavy
rocks
have
got
a
high
natural
count
there
maybe
could
be
a
box
of
instruments
there
with
fluorescent
dials
or
it
might
be
one
of
those
tactical
atom
bombs
they
threw
at
us
already
some
arms
runner
sold
them
a
few
or
it
could
be
the
cobalt
bombs
it
could
be
telt
said
packing
his
instruments
swiftly
a
badly
shielded
bomb
or
an
old
one
with
a
crack
in
the
skin
could
give
a
trace
like
that
just
a
little
radon
leaking
out
would
do
it
why
do
you
call
hys
on
the
radio
and
let
him
know
i
do
want
granddaddy
krafft
listening
posts
to
hear
about
it
this
is
our
job
if
i
right
and
i
have
to
check
my
old
tapes
to
make
sure
but
it
gon
na
be
worth
a
raid
i
can
feel
that
in
my
bones
let
unload
your
corpse
he
helped
brion
with
the
clumsy
wrapped
bundle
then
slipped
into
the
driver
seat
hold
it
brion
said
do
you
have
anything
in
the
med
box
i
can
use
for
lea
she
seems
to
have
cracked
not
hysterical
but
withdrawn
wo
listen
to
reason
wo
do
anything
but
lie
there
and
ask
to
go
home
got
the
potion
here
telt
said
cracking
the
med
box
is
what
our
medic
calls
it
hit
a
lot
of
our
boys
grow
up
all
your
life
hating
the
idea
of
violence
and
it
goes
rough
when
you
have
to
start
killing
people
guys
break
up
break
down
go
to
pieces
lots
of
different
ways
the
medic
mixed
up
this
stuff
do
know
how
it
works
probably
tranquilizers
and
some
of
the
cortex
drugs
but
it
peels
off
recent
memories
maybe
for
the
last
ten
twelve
hours
you
ca
get
upset
about
what
you
remember
he
pulled
out
a
sealed
package
directions
on
the
box
good
luck
luck
brion
said
and
shook
the
technician
calloused
hand
let
me
know
if
the
traces
are
strong
enough
to
be
bombs
he
checked
the
street
to
make
sure
it
was
clear
then
pressed
the
door
button
the
sand
car
churned
out
into
the
brilliant
sunshine
and
was
gone
the
throb
of
its
motor
dying
in
the
distance
brion
closed
the
door
and
went
back
to
lea
ulv
was
still
crouched
against
the
wall
there
was
a
disposable
hypodermic
in
the
box
lea
made
no
protest
when
he
broke
the
seal
and
pressed
the
needle
against
her
arm
she
sighed
and
her
eyes
closed
again
when
he
saw
she
was
resting
easily
he
dragged
in
the
body
of
the
magter
a
ran
along
one
wall
and
he
struggled
the
corpse
up
onto
it
he
unwrapped
the
tarpaulin
and
the
sightless
eyes
stared
accusingly
up
into
his
using
his
knife
brion
cut
away
the
loose
clothing
strapped
under
the
clothes
around
the
man
waist
was
the
familiar
collection
of
disan
artifacts
this
could
have
significance
either
way
human
or
humanoid
the
creature
would
still
have
to
live
on
dis
brion
threw
it
aside
along
with
the
clothing
nude
pierced
bloody
the
corpse
lay
before
him
in
every
external
physical
detail
the
man
was
human
brion
theory
was
becoming
more
preposterous
with
each
discovery
if
the
magter
were
alien
how
could
he
explain
their
complete
lack
of
emotions
a
mutation
of
some
kind
he
did
see
how
it
was
possible
there
to
be
something
alien
about
the
dead
man
before
him
the
future
of
a
world
rested
on
this
flimsy
hope
if
telt
lead
to
the
bombs
proved
to
be
false
there
would
be
no
hope
left
at
all
lea
was
still
unconscious
when
he
looked
at
her
again
there
was
no
way
of
telling
how
long
the
coma
would
last
he
would
probably
have
to
waken
her
out
of
it
but
he
did
want
to
do
it
too
early
it
took
an
effort
to
control
his
impatience
even
though
he
knew
the
drug
needed
time
in
which
to
work
he
finally
decided
on
at
least
a
minimum
of
an
hour
before
he
should
try
to
disturb
her
that
would
be
noon
twelve
hours
before
destruction
one
thing
he
should
do
was
to
get
in
touch
with
krafft
maybe
it
was
being
defeatist
but
he
had
to
make
sure
that
they
had
a
way
off
this
planet
if
the
mission
failed
krafft
had
installed
a
relay
radio
that
would
forward
calls
from
his
personal
set
if
this
relay
had
been
in
the
foundation
building
contact
was
broken
this
had
to
be
found
out
before
it
was
too
late
brion
thumbed
on
his
radio
and
sent
the
call
the
reply
came
back
instantly
this
is
fleet
communications
will
you
please
keep
this
circuit
open
commander
krafft
is
waiting
for
this
call
and
it
is
being
put
directly
through
to
him
now
krafft
voice
broke
in
while
the
operator
was
still
talking
who
is
making
this
call
is
it
anyone
from
the
foundation
the
old
man
voice
was
shaky
with
emotion
brandd
here
i
have
lea
morees
with
me
no
more
are
there
no
other
survivors
from
the
disaster
that
destroyed
your
building
that
it
other
than
us
it
a
complete
loss
with
the
building
and
all
the
instruments
gone
i
have
no
way
to
contact
our
ship
in
orbit
can
you
arrange
to
get
us
out
of
here
if
necessary
give
me
your
location
a
ship
is
coming
now
i
do
need
a
ship
now
brion
interrupted
do
send
it
until
i
call
if
there
is
a
way
to
stop
your
destruction
i
find
it
so
i
staying
to
the
last
minute
if
necessary
krafft
was
silent
there
was
only
the
crackle
of
an
open
mike
and
the
sound
of
breathing
that
is
your
decision
he
said
finally
i
have
a
ship
standing
by
but
wo
you
let
us
take
miss
morees
out
now
no
i
need
her
here
we
are
still
working
looking
for
what
answer
can
you
find
that
could
possibly
avert
destruction
now
his
tone
was
between
hope
and
despair
brion
could
help
him
if
i
succeed
you
know
otherwise
that
will
be
the
end
of
it
end
of
transmission
he
switched
the
radio
off
lea
was
sleeping
easily
when
he
looked
at
her
and
there
was
still
a
good
part
of
the
hour
left
before
he
could
wake
her
how
could
he
put
it
to
use
she
would
need
tools
instruments
to
examine
the
corpse
and
there
were
certainly
none
here
perhaps
he
could
find
some
in
the
ruins
of
the
foundation
building
with
this
thought
he
had
the
sudden
desire
to
see
the
wreckage
up
close
there
might
be
other
survivors
he
had
to
find
out
if
he
could
talk
to
the
men
he
had
seen
working
there
ulv
was
still
crouched
against
the
wall
in
the
outer
room
he
looked
up
angrily
when
brion
came
over
but
said
nothing
will
you
help
me
again
brion
asked
stay
and
watch
the
girl
while
i
go
out
i
be
back
at
noon
ulv
did
answer
i
am
still
looking
for
the
way
to
save
dis
brion
added
go
i
watch
the
girl
ulv
spat
words
in
impotent
fury
i
do
not
know
what
to
do
you
may
be
right
go
she
will
be
safe
with
me
brion
slipped
out
into
the
deserted
street
and
half
running
half
walking
made
his
way
towards
the
rubble
that
had
been
the
cultural
relationships
foundation
he
used
a
different
course
from
the
one
they
had
come
by
striking
first
towards
the
outer
edge
of
the
city
once
there
he
could
swing
and
approach
from
the
other
side
so
there
would
be
no
indication
where
he
had
come
from
the
magter
might
be
watching
and
he
did
want
to
lead
them
to
lea
and
the
stolen
body
turning
a
corner
he
saw
a
sand
car
stopped
in
the
street
ahead
there
was
something
familiar
about
the
lines
of
it
it
could
be
the
one
he
and
telt
had
used
but
he
was
sure
he
looked
around
but
the
dusty
street
was
white
and
empty
shimmering
in
silence
under
the
sun
staying
close
to
the
wall
and
watching
carefully
brion
slipped
towards
the
car
when
he
came
close
behind
it
he
was
positive
it
was
the
one
he
had
been
in
the
night
before
what
was
it
doing
here
silence
and
heat
filled
the
street
windows
and
doors
were
empty
and
there
was
no
motion
in
their
shadows
putting
his
foot
on
a
bogey
wheel
he
reached
up
and
grabbed
the
searing
metal
rim
of
the
open
window
he
pulled
himself
up
and
stared
at
telt
smiling
face
smiling
in
death
the
lips
pulled
back
to
reveal
the
grinning
teeth
the
eyes
bursting
from
the
head
the
features
swollen
and
contorted
from
the
deadly
poison
a
tiny
tufted
dart
of
wood
stuck
in
the
brown
flesh
on
the
side
of
his
neck
xv
brion
hurled
himself
backward
and
sprawled
flat
in
the
dust
and
filth
of
the
road
no
poison
dart
sought
him
out
the
empty
silence
still
reigned
telt
murderers
had
come
and
gone
moving
quickly
using
the
bulk
of
the
car
as
a
shield
he
opened
the
door
and
slipped
inside
they
had
done
a
thorough
job
of
destruction
all
of
the
controls
had
been
battered
into
uselessness
the
floor
was
a
junk
heap
of
crushed
equipment
intertwined
with
loops
of
recording
tape
bulging
like
mechanical
intestines
a
gutted
machine
destroyed
like
its
driver
it
was
easy
enough
to
reconstruct
what
had
happened
the
car
had
been
seen
when
they
entered
the
city
probably
by
some
of
the
magter
who
had
destroyed
the
foundation
building
they
had
not
seen
where
it
had
gone
or
brion
would
surely
be
dead
by
now
but
they
must
have
spotted
it
when
telt
tried
to
leave
the
city
and
stopped
it
in
the
most
effective
way
possible
a
dart
through
the
open
window
into
the
unsuspecting
driver
neck
telt
dead
the
brutal
impact
of
the
man
death
had
driven
all
thought
of
its
consequences
from
brion
mind
now
he
began
to
realize
telt
had
never
sent
word
of
his
discovery
of
the
radioactive
trace
to
the
nyjord
army
he
had
been
afraid
to
use
the
radio
and
had
wanted
to
tell
hys
in
person
and
to
show
him
the
tape
only
now
the
tape
was
torn
and
mixed
with
all
the
others
the
brain
that
could
have
analyzed
it
dead
brion
looked
at
the
dangling
entrails
of
the
radio
and
spun
for
the
door
running
swiftly
and
erratically
he
fled
from
the
sand
car
his
own
survival
and
the
possible
survival
of
dis
depended
on
his
not
being
seen
near
it
he
must
contact
hys
and
pass
on
the
information
until
he
did
that
he
was
the
only
offworlder
on
dis
who
knew
which
magter
tower
might
contain
the
bombs
once
out
of
sight
of
the
sand
car
he
went
more
slowly
wiping
the
sweat
from
his
streaming
face
he
had
been
seen
leaving
the
car
and
he
was
being
followed
the
streets
here
were
familiar
but
he
checked
his
direction
by
the
sun
and
walked
at
a
steady
fast
pace
towards
the
destroyed
building
more
of
the
native
disans
were
in
the
streets
now
they
all
noticed
him
some
even
stopped
and
scowled
fiercely
at
him
with
his
emphatic
awareness
he
felt
their
anger
and
hatred
a
knot
of
men
radiated
death
and
he
put
his
hand
on
his
gun
as
he
passed
them
two
of
them
had
their
blowguns
ready
but
use
them
by
the
time
he
had
turned
the
next
corner
he
was
soaked
with
nervous
perspiration
ahead
was
the
rubble
of
the
destroyed
building
grounded
next
to
it
was
the
tapered
form
of
a
spacer
pinnace
two
men
had
come
from
the
open
lock
and
were
standing
at
the
edge
of
the
burnt
area
brion
boots
grated
loudly
on
the
broken
wreckage
the
men
turned
quickly
towards
him
guns
raised
both
of
them
carried
ion
rifles
they
relaxed
when
they
saw
his
offworld
clothes
bloody
damned
savages
one
of
them
growled
he
was
a
man
a
column
of
muscle
and
gristle
whose
head
barely
reached
brion
chest
a
cap
had
the
crossed
symbol
of
ship
computer
man
ca
blame
them
i
guess
the
second
man
said
he
wore
insignia
his
features
were
different
but
with
the
same
compacted
body
the
two
men
were
as
physically
alike
as
twins
probably
from
the
same
home
planet
they
gon
na
get
their
whole
world
blown
out
from
under
them
at
midnight
looks
as
if
the
poor
slob
in
the
streets
finally
realized
what
is
happening
hope
we
in
by
then
i
saw
estrada
world
get
it
and
i
do
want
to
see
that
again
not
twice
in
one
lifetime
the
computer
man
was
looking
closely
at
brion
head
tilted
sideways
to
see
his
face
you
need
transportation
offworld
he
asked
we
the
last
ship
at
the
port
and
we
going
to
boil
out
of
here
as
soon
as
the
rest
of
our
cargo
is
aboard
we
give
you
a
lift
if
you
need
it
only
by
a
tremendous
effort
at
control
did
brion
conceal
the
destroying
sorrow
that
overwhelmed
him
when
he
looked
at
that
shattered
wasteland
the
graveyard
of
so
many
no
he
said
that
wo
be
necessary
i
in
touch
with
the
blockading
fleet
and
they
pick
me
up
before
midnight
you
from
nyjord
the
purser
growled
no
brion
said
still
only
half
aware
of
the
men
but
there
is
trouble
with
my
own
ship
he
realized
that
they
were
looking
intently
at
him
that
he
owed
them
some
kind
of
explanation
i
thought
i
could
find
a
way
to
stop
the
war
now
i
not
so
sure
he
had
intended
to
be
so
frank
with
the
spacemen
but
the
words
had
been
uppermost
in
his
thoughts
and
had
simply
slipped
out
the
computer
man
started
to
say
something
but
his
shipmate
speared
him
in
the
side
with
his
elbow
we
blast
soon
and
i
do
like
the
way
these
disans
are
looking
at
us
the
captain
said
to
find
out
what
caused
the
fire
then
get
the
hell
back
so
let
go
do
miss
your
ship
the
computer
man
said
to
brion
and
he
started
for
the
pinnace
then
he
hesitated
and
turned
sure
there
nothing
we
can
do
for
you
sorrow
would
accomplish
nothing
brion
fought
to
sweep
the
dregs
of
emotion
from
his
mind
and
to
think
clearly
you
can
help
me
he
said
i
could
use
a
scalpel
or
any
other
surgical
instrument
you
might
have
lea
would
need
those
then
he
remembered
undelivered
message
do
you
have
a
portable
radio
transceiver
i
can
pay
you
for
it
the
computer
man
vanished
inside
the
rocket
and
reappeared
a
minute
later
with
a
small
package
there
a
scalpel
and
a
magnetized
tweezers
in
here
all
i
could
find
in
the
med
kit
hope
they
do
he
reached
inside
and
swung
out
the
metal
case
of
a
transceiver
take
this
it
got
plenty
of
range
even
on
the
longer
frequencies
he
raised
his
hand
at
brion
offer
to
pay
my
donation
he
said
if
you
can
save
this
planet
i
give
you
the
whole
pinnace
as
well
we
tell
the
captain
we
lost
the
radio
in
some
trouble
with
the
natives
is
that
right
moneybags
he
prodded
the
purser
in
the
chest
with
a
finger
that
would
have
punched
a
hole
through
a
weaker
man
i
read
you
loud
and
clear
the
purser
said
i
make
out
an
invoice
so
stating
back
in
the
ship
they
were
both
in
the
pinnace
then
and
brion
had
to
move
fast
to
get
clear
of
the
takeoff
blast
a
sense
of
obligation
the
spacemen
had
felt
it
too
the
realization
of
this
raised
brion
spirits
a
bit
as
he
searched
through
the
rubble
for
anything
useful
he
recognized
part
of
a
wall
still
standing
as
a
corner
of
the
laboratory
poking
through
the
ruins
he
unearthed
broken
instruments
and
a
single
battered
case
that
had
barely
missed
destruction
inside
was
the
binocular
microscope
the
right
tube
bent
its
lenses
cracked
and
obscured
the
left
eyepiece
still
seemed
to
be
functioning
brion
carefully
put
it
back
in
the
case
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
almost
noon
these
few
pieces
of
equipment
would
have
to
do
for
the
dissection
watched
suspiciously
by
the
onlooking
disans
he
started
back
to
the
warehouse
it
was
a
long
circuitous
walk
since
he
did
dare
give
any
clues
to
his
destination
only
when
he
was
positive
he
had
not
been
observed
or
followed
did
he
slip
through
the
building
entrance
locking
the
door
behind
him
lea
frightened
eyes
met
his
when
he
went
into
the
office
a
friendly
smile
here
among
the
cannibals
she
called
her
strained
expression
gave
the
lie
to
the
cheeriness
of
her
words
what
has
happened
since
i
woke
up
the
great
stone
face
over
there
she
pointed
to
ulv
has
been
telling
me
exactly
nothing
what
the
last
thing
you
can
remember
brion
asked
carefully
he
did
want
to
tell
her
too
much
lest
this
bring
on
the
shock
again
ulv
had
shown
great
presence
of
mind
in
not
talking
to
her
if
you
must
know
lea
said
i
remember
quite
a
lot
brion
brandd
i
sha
go
into
details
since
this
sort
of
thing
is
best
kept
from
the
natives
for
the
record
then
i
can
recall
going
to
sleep
after
you
left
and
nothing
since
then
it
weird
i
went
to
sleep
in
that
lumpy
hospital
bed
and
woke
up
on
this
couch
feeling
simply
terrible
with
just
sitting
there
and
scowling
at
me
you
please
tell
me
what
is
going
on
a
partial
truth
was
best
saving
all
of
the
details
that
he
could
for
later
the
magter
attacked
the
foundation
building
he
said
they
are
getting
angry
at
all
offworlders
now
you
were
still
knocked
out
by
a
sleeping
drug
so
ulv
helped
bring
you
here
afternoon
now
of
the
last
day
she
sounded
horrified
while
i
playing
sleeping
beauty
the
world
is
coming
to
an
end
was
anyone
hurt
in
the
attack
or
killed
there
were
a
number
of
casualties
and
plenty
of
trouble
brion
said
he
had
to
get
her
off
the
subject
walking
over
to
the
corpse
he
threw
back
the
cover
from
its
face
but
this
is
more
important
right
now
it
one
of
the
magter
i
have
a
scalpel
and
some
other
things
here
will
you
perform
an
autopsy
lea
huddled
back
on
the
couch
her
arms
around
herself
looking
chilled
in
spite
of
the
heat
of
the
day
what
happened
to
the
people
at
the
building
she
asked
in
a
thin
voice
the
injection
had
removed
her
memories
of
the
tragedy
but
echoes
of
the
strain
and
shock
still
reverberated
in
her
mind
and
body
i
feel
so
exhausted
please
tell
me
what
happened
i
have
the
feeling
hiding
something
brion
sat
next
to
her
and
took
her
hands
in
his
not
surprised
to
find
them
cold
looking
into
her
eyes
he
tried
to
give
her
some
of
his
strength
it
was
very
nice
he
said
you
were
shaken
up
by
it
i
imagine
that
why
you
feel
the
way
you
do
now
but
lea
you
have
to
take
my
word
for
this
do
ask
any
more
questions
there
nothing
we
can
do
now
about
it
but
we
can
still
find
out
about
the
magter
will
you
examine
the
corpse
she
started
to
ask
something
then
changed
her
mind
when
she
dropped
her
eyes
brion
felt
the
thin
shiver
that
went
through
her
body
there
something
terribly
wrong
she
said
i
know
that
i
guess
i
have
to
take
your
word
that
it
best
not
to
ask
questions
help
me
up
will
you
darling
my
legs
are
absolutely
liquid
leaning
on
him
with
his
arm
around
her
supporting
most
of
her
weight
she
went
slowly
across
to
the
corpse
she
looked
down
and
shuddered
not
what
you
would
call
a
natural
death
she
said
ulv
watched
intently
as
she
took
the
scalpel
out
of
its
holder
you
do
have
to
look
at
this
she
told
him
in
halting
disan
not
if
you
do
want
to
i
want
to
he
told
her
not
taking
his
eyes
from
the
body
i
have
never
seen
a
magter
dead
before
or
without
covering
like
an
ordinary
person
he
continued
to
stare
fixedly
find
me
some
drinking
water
will
you
brion
lea
said
and
spread
the
tarp
under
the
body
these
things
are
quite
messy
after
drinking
the
water
she
seemed
stronger
and
could
stand
without
holding
onto
the
table
with
both
hands
placing
the
tip
of
the
scalpel
just
below
the
magter
breast
bone
she
made
the
long
incision
down
to
the
pubic
symphysis
the
great
wound
gaped
open
like
a
red
mouth
across
the
table
ulv
shuddered
but
did
avert
his
eyes
one
by
one
she
removed
the
internal
organs
once
she
looked
up
at
brion
then
quickly
returned
to
work
the
silence
stretched
on
and
on
until
brion
had
to
break
it
tell
me
ca
you
have
you
found
out
anything
his
words
snapped
the
thin
strand
of
her
strength
and
she
staggered
back
to
the
couch
and
collapsed
onto
it
her
bloodstained
hands
hung
over
the
side
making
a
strangely
terrible
contrast
to
the
whiteness
of
her
skin
i
sorry
brion
she
said
but
there
nothing
nothing
at
all
there
are
minor
differences
organic
changes
i
never
seen
before
his
liver
is
tremendous
for
one
thing
but
changes
like
this
are
certainly
consistent
within
the
pattern
of
homo
sapiens
as
adapted
to
a
different
planet
he
a
man
changed
adapted
modified
but
still
just
as
human
as
you
or
i
how
can
you
be
sure
brion
broke
in
you
have
examined
him
completely
have
you
she
shook
her
head
then
go
on
the
other
organs
his
brain
a
microscopic
examination
here
he
said
pushing
the
microscope
case
towards
her
with
both
hands
she
dropped
her
head
onto
her
forearms
and
sobbed
leave
me
alone
ca
you
i
tired
and
sick
and
fed
up
with
this
awful
planet
let
them
die
i
do
care
your
theory
is
false
useless
admit
that
and
let
me
wash
the
filth
from
my
hands
sobbing
drowned
out
her
words
brion
stood
over
her
and
drew
a
shuddering
breath
was
he
wrong
he
did
dare
think
about
that
he
had
to
go
on
looking
down
at
the
thinness
of
her
bent
back
with
the
tiny
projections
of
her
spine
showing
through
the
thin
cloth
he
felt
an
immense
pity
a
pity
he
could
surrender
to
this
thin
helpless
frightened
woman
was
his
only
resource
she
had
to
work
he
had
to
her
work
ihjel
had
done
it
used
projective
empathy
to
impress
his
emotions
upon
brion
now
brion
must
do
it
with
lea
he
had
had
some
sessions
in
the
art
but
not
nearly
enough
to
make
him
proficient
nevertheless
he
had
to
try
strength
was
what
lea
needed
aloud
he
said
simply
you
can
do
it
you
have
the
will
and
the
strength
to
finish
and
silently
his
mind
cried
out
the
order
to
obey
to
share
his
power
now
that
hers
was
drained
and
finished
only
when
she
lifted
her
face
and
he
saw
the
dried
tears
did
he
realize
that
he
had
succeeded
you
will
go
on
he
asked
quietly
lea
merely
nodded
and
rose
to
her
feet
she
shuffled
like
a
sleepwalker
jerked
along
by
invisible
strings
her
strength
her
own
and
the
situation
reminded
him
unhappily
of
that
last
event
of
the
twenties
when
he
had
experienced
the
same
kind
of
draining
activity
she
wiped
her
hands
roughly
on
her
clothes
and
opened
the
microscope
case
the
slides
are
all
broken
she
said
this
will
do
brion
told
her
crashing
his
heel
through
the
glass
partition
shards
tinkled
and
crashed
to
the
floor
he
took
some
of
the
bigger
pieces
and
broke
them
to
rough
squares
that
would
fit
under
the
clips
on
the
stage
lea
accepted
them
without
a
word
putting
a
drop
of
the
magter
blood
on
the
slide
she
bent
over
the
eyepiece
her
hands
shook
when
she
tried
to
adjust
the
focusing
using
low
power
she
examined
the
specimen
squinting
through
the
angled
tube
once
she
turned
the
mirror
a
bit
to
catch
the
light
streaming
in
the
window
brion
stood
behind
her
fists
clenched
forceably
controlling
his
anxiety
what
do
you
see
he
finally
blurted
out
phagocytes
platelets
leucocytes
everything
seems
normal
her
voice
was
dull
exhausted
her
eyes
blinking
with
fatigue
as
she
stared
into
the
tube
anger
at
defeat
burned
through
brion
even
faced
with
failure
he
refused
to
accept
it
he
reached
over
her
shoulder
and
savagely
twisted
the
turret
of
microscope
until
the
longest
lens
was
in
position
if
you
ca
see
anything
try
the
high
power
there
i
know
it
there
i
get
you
a
tissue
specimen
he
turned
back
to
the
disemboweled
cadaver
his
back
was
turned
and
he
did
not
see
that
sudden
stiffening
of
her
shoulders
or
the
sudden
eagerness
that
seized
her
fingers
as
they
adjusted
the
focus
but
he
did
feel
the
wave
of
emotion
that
welled
from
her
impinging
directly
on
his
empathetic
sense
what
is
it
he
called
to
her
as
if
she
had
spoken
aloud
something
something
here
she
said
in
this
leucocyte
not
normal
structure
but
it
familiar
i
seen
something
like
it
before
but
i
just
ca
remember
she
turned
away
from
the
microscope
and
unthinkingly
pressed
her
gory
knuckles
to
her
forehead
i
know
i
seen
it
before
brion
squinted
into
the
deserted
microscope
and
made
out
a
dim
shape
in
the
center
of
the
field
it
stood
out
sharply
when
he
focused
the
white
jellyfish
shape
of
a
leucocyte
to
his
untrained
eye
there
was
nothing
unusual
about
it
he
know
what
was
strange
when
he
had
no
idea
of
what
was
normal
do
you
see
those
spherical
green
shapes
grouped
together
lea
asked
before
brion
could
answer
she
gasped
i
remember
now
her
fatigue
was
forgotten
in
her
excitement
that
was
the
name
something
like
that
it
a
coccid
a
little
scale
insect
it
had
those
same
shapes
collected
together
within
its
individual
cells
what
do
they
mean
what
is
the
connection
with
dis
i
do
know
she
said
it
just
that
they
look
so
similar
and
i
never
saw
anything
like
this
in
a
human
cell
before
in
the
coccids
the
green
particles
grow
into
a
kind
of
yeast
that
lives
within
the
insect
not
a
parasite
but
a
real
symbiote
her
eyes
opened
wide
as
she
caught
the
significance
of
her
own
words
a
symbiote
and
dis
was
the
world
where
symbiosis
and
parasitism
had
become
more
advanced
and
complex
than
on
any
other
planet
lea
thoughts
spun
around
this
fact
and
chewed
at
the
fringes
of
the
logic
brion
could
sense
her
concentration
and
absorption
he
did
nothing
to
break
the
mood
her
hands
were
clenched
her
eyes
staring
unseeingly
at
the
wall
as
her
mind
raced
brion
and
ulv
were
quiet
watching
her
waiting
for
her
conclusions
the
pieces
were
falling
into
shape
at
last
lea
opened
her
clenched
hands
and
smoothed
them
on
her
sodden
skirt
she
blinked
and
turned
to
brion
is
there
a
tool
box
here
she
asked
her
words
were
so
unexpected
that
brion
could
not
answer
for
a
moment
before
he
could
say
anything
she
spoke
again
not
hand
tools
that
would
take
too
long
could
you
find
anything
like
a
power
saw
that
would
be
ideal
she
turned
back
to
the
microscope
and
he
did
try
to
question
her
ulv
was
still
looking
at
the
body
of
the
magter
and
had
understood
nothing
of
what
they
had
said
brion
went
out
into
the
loading
bay
there
was
nothing
he
could
use
on
the
ground
floor
so
he
took
the
stairs
to
the
floor
above
a
corridor
here
passed
by
a
number
of
rooms
all
of
the
doors
were
locked
including
one
with
the
hopeful
sign
tool
room
on
it
he
battered
at
the
metal
door
with
his
shoulder
without
budging
it
as
he
stepped
back
to
look
for
another
way
in
he
glanced
at
his
watch
two
in
ten
hours
the
bombs
would
fall
on
dis
the
need
for
haste
tore
at
him
yet
there
could
be
no
noise
someone
in
the
street
might
hear
it
he
quickly
stripped
off
his
shirt
and
wrapped
it
in
a
loose
roll
around
the
barrel
of
his
gun
extending
it
in
a
loose
tube
in
front
of
the
barrel
holding
the
rolled
cloth
in
his
left
hand
he
jammed
the
gun
up
tight
against
the
door
the
muzzle
against
the
lock
the
single
shot
was
only
a
dull
thud
inaudible
outside
of
the
building
pieces
of
broken
mechanism
jarred
and
rattled
inside
the
lock
and
the
door
swung
open
when
he
came
back
lea
was
standing
by
the
body
he
held
the
small
power
saw
with
a
rotary
blade
will
this
do
he
asked
runs
on
its
own
battery
almost
fully
charged
too
perfect
she
answered
you
both
going
to
have
to
help
me
she
switched
into
the
disan
language
ulv
would
you
find
some
place
where
you
can
watch
the
street
without
being
seen
signal
me
when
it
is
empty
i
afraid
this
saw
is
going
to
make
a
lot
of
noise
ulv
nodded
and
went
out
into
the
bay
where
he
climbed
a
heap
of
empty
crates
so
he
could
peer
through
the
small
windows
set
high
in
the
wall
he
looked
carefully
in
both
directions
then
waved
to
her
to
go
ahead
stand
to
one
side
and
hold
the
cadaver
chin
brion
she
said
hold
it
firmly
so
the
head
does
shake
around
when
i
cut
this
is
going
to
be
a
little
gruesome
i
sorry
but
it
be
the
fastest
way
to
cut
the
bone
the
saw
bit
into
the
skull
once
ulv
waved
them
into
silence
and
shrank
back
himself
into
the
shadows
next
to
the
window
they
waited
impatiently
until
he
gave
them
the
sign
to
continue
again
brion
held
steady
while
the
saw
cut
a
circle
completely
around
the
skull
finished
lea
said
and
the
saw
dropped
from
her
limp
fingers
to
the
floor
she
massaged
life
back
into
her
hands
before
she
finished
the
job
carefully
and
delicately
she
removed
the
cap
of
bone
from
the
magter
head
exposing
his
brain
to
the
shaft
of
light
from
the
window
you
were
right
all
the
time
brion
she
said
there
is
your
alien
xvi
ulv
joined
them
as
they
looked
down
at
the
exposed
brain
of
the
magter
the
thing
was
so
clearly
evident
that
even
ulv
noticed
it
i
have
seen
dead
animals
and
my
people
dead
with
their
heads
open
but
i
have
never
seen
anything
like
that
before
he
said
what
is
it
brion
asked
the
invader
the
alien
you
were
looking
for
lea
told
him
the
magter
brain
was
only
of
what
would
have
been
its
normal
size
instead
of
filling
the
skull
completely
it
shared
the
space
with
a
green
amorphous
shape
this
was
ridged
somewhat
like
a
brain
but
the
green
shape
had
still
darker
nodules
and
extensions
lea
took
her
scalpel
and
gently
prodded
the
dark
moist
mass
it
reminds
me
very
much
of
something
that
i
seen
before
on
earth
she
said
the
and
an
unusual
organ
it
has
called
the
pseudova
now
that
i
have
seen
this
growth
in
the
magter
skull
i
can
think
of
a
positive
parallel
the
fly
also
had
a
large
green
organ
only
it
fills
half
of
the
body
cavity
instead
of
the
head
its
identity
puzzled
biologists
for
years
and
they
had
a
number
of
complex
theories
to
explain
it
finally
someone
managed
to
dissect
and
examine
it
the
pseudova
turned
out
to
be
a
living
plant
a
yeastlike
growth
that
helps
with
the
digestion
it
produces
enzymes
that
enable
the
fly
to
digest
the
great
amounts
of
sugar
it
gets
from
plant
juice
that
not
unusual
brion
said
puzzled
termites
and
human
beings
are
a
couple
of
other
creatures
whose
digestion
is
helped
by
internal
flora
what
the
difference
in
the
reproduction
mainly
all
the
other
plants
have
to
enter
the
host
and
establish
themselves
as
outsiders
permitted
to
remain
as
long
as
they
are
useful
the
and
its
yeast
plant
have
a
permanent
symbiotic
relationship
that
is
essential
to
the
existence
of
both
the
plant
spores
appear
in
many
places
throughout
the
body
but
they
are
in
the
germ
cells
every
egg
cell
has
some
and
every
egg
that
grows
to
maturity
is
infected
with
the
plant
spores
the
continuation
of
the
symbiosis
is
unbroken
and
guaranteed
do
you
think
those
green
spheres
in
the
magter
blood
cells
could
be
the
same
kind
of
thing
brion
asked
i
sure
of
it
lea
said
it
must
be
the
same
process
there
are
probably
green
spheres
throughout
the
magters
bodies
spores
or
offspring
of
those
things
in
their
brains
enough
will
find
their
way
to
the
germ
cells
to
make
sure
that
every
young
magter
is
infected
at
birth
while
the
child
is
growing
so
is
the
symbiote
probably
a
lot
faster
since
it
seems
to
be
a
simpler
organism
i
imagine
it
is
well
established
in
the
brain
pan
within
the
first
six
months
of
the
infant
life
but
why
brion
asked
what
does
it
do
i
only
guessing
now
but
there
is
plenty
of
evidence
that
gives
us
an
idea
of
its
function
i
willing
to
bet
that
the
symbiote
itself
is
not
a
simple
organism
it
probably
an
amalgam
of
plant
and
animal
like
most
of
the
other
creatures
on
dis
the
thing
is
just
too
complex
to
have
developed
since
mankind
has
been
on
this
planet
the
magter
must
have
caught
the
symbiotic
infection
eating
some
disan
animal
the
symbiote
lived
and
flourished
in
its
new
environment
well
protected
by
a
bony
skull
in
a
host
in
exchange
for
food
oxygen
and
comfort
the
must
generate
hormones
and
enzymes
that
enable
the
magter
to
survive
some
of
these
might
aid
digestion
enabling
the
magter
to
eat
any
plant
or
animal
life
they
can
lay
their
hands
on
the
symbiote
might
produce
sugars
scavenge
the
blood
of
toxins
there
are
so
many
things
it
could
do
things
it
must
have
done
since
the
magter
are
obviously
the
dominant
life
form
on
this
planet
they
paid
a
high
price
for
the
symbiote
but
it
did
matter
to
race
survival
until
now
did
you
notice
that
the
magter
brain
is
no
smaller
than
normal
it
must
be
or
how
else
could
that
fit
in
inside
the
skull
with
it
brion
said
if
the
magter
total
brain
were
smaller
in
volume
than
normal
it
could
fit
into
the
remaining
space
in
the
cranial
hollow
but
the
brain
is
it
is
just
that
part
of
it
is
missing
absorbed
by
the
symbiote
the
frontal
lobes
brion
said
with
sudden
realization
this
hellish
growth
has
performed
a
prefrontal
lobotomy
it
done
even
more
than
that
lea
said
separating
the
convolutions
of
the
gray
matter
with
her
scalpel
to
uncover
a
green
filament
beneath
these
tendrils
penetrate
further
back
into
the
brain
but
always
remain
in
the
cerebrum
the
cerebellum
appears
to
be
untouched
apparently
just
the
higher
functions
of
mankind
have
been
interfered
with
selectively
destruction
of
the
frontal
lobes
made
the
magter
creatures
without
emotions
or
ability
for
really
abstract
thought
apparently
they
survived
better
without
these
there
must
have
been
some
horrible
failures
before
the
right
balance
was
struck
the
final
product
is
a
symbiote
that
is
admirably
adapted
for
survival
on
this
disaster
world
no
emotions
to
cause
complications
or
desires
that
might
interfere
with
pure
survival
complete
ruthlessness
mankind
has
always
been
strong
on
this
anyway
so
it
did
take
much
of
a
push
the
other
disans
like
ulv
here
managed
to
survive
without
turning
into
such
a
creature
so
why
was
it
necessary
for
the
magter
to
go
so
far
nothing
is
necessary
in
evolution
you
know
that
lea
said
many
variations
are
possible
and
all
the
better
ones
continue
you
might
say
that
ulv
people
survive
but
the
magter
survive
better
if
offworld
contact
had
been
i
imagine
that
the
magter
would
slowly
have
become
the
dominant
race
only
they
have
the
chance
now
it
looks
as
though
they
have
succeeded
in
destroying
both
races
with
their
suicidal
urge
that
the
part
that
does
make
sense
brion
said
the
magter
have
survived
and
climbed
right
to
the
top
of
the
evolutionary
heap
here
yet
they
are
suicidal
how
does
it
happen
they
have
been
wiped
out
before
this
individually
they
have
been
aggressive
to
the
point
of
suicide
they
will
attack
anything
and
everything
with
the
same
savage
lack
of
emotion
luckily
there
are
no
bigger
animals
on
this
planet
so
where
they
have
died
as
individuals
their
utter
ruthlessness
has
guaranteed
their
survival
as
a
group
now
they
are
faced
with
a
problem
that
is
too
big
for
their
minds
to
handle
their
personal
policy
has
become
their
planetary
policy
and
never
a
very
smart
thing
they
are
like
men
with
knives
who
have
killed
all
the
men
who
were
only
armed
with
stones
now
they
are
facing
men
with
guns
and
they
are
going
to
keep
charging
and
fighting
until
they
are
all
dead
it
a
perfect
case
of
the
utter
impartiality
of
the
forces
of
evolution
men
infected
by
this
disan
life
form
were
the
dominant
creatures
on
this
planet
the
creature
in
the
magters
brains
was
a
true
symbiote
then
giving
something
and
receiving
something
making
a
union
of
symbiotes
where
all
were
stronger
together
than
any
could
be
separately
now
this
is
changed
the
magter
brain
can
not
understand
the
concept
of
racial
death
in
a
situation
where
it
must
understand
to
be
able
to
survive
therefore
the
is
no
longer
a
symbiote
but
a
parasite
and
as
a
parasite
it
must
be
destroyed
brion
broke
in
we
not
fighting
shadows
any
more
he
exulted
we
found
the
enemy
and
it
not
the
magter
at
all
just
a
sort
of
glorified
tapeworm
that
is
too
stupid
to
know
when
it
is
killing
itself
off
does
it
have
a
brain
can
it
think
i
doubt
it
very
much
lea
said
a
brain
would
be
of
absolutely
no
use
to
it
so
even
if
it
originally
possessed
reasoning
powers
they
would
be
gone
by
now
symbiotes
or
parasites
that
live
internally
like
this
always
degenerate
to
an
absolute
minimum
of
functions
tell
me
about
it
what
is
this
thing
ulv
broke
in
prodding
the
soft
form
of
the
he
had
heard
all
their
excited
talk
but
had
not
understood
a
word
explain
it
to
him
will
you
lea
as
best
you
can
brion
said
looking
at
her
and
he
realized
how
exhausted
she
was
and
sit
down
while
you
do
it
you
long
overdue
for
a
rest
i
going
to
try
he
broke
off
when
he
looked
at
his
watch
it
was
after
four
in
the
afternoon
less
than
eight
hours
to
go
what
was
he
to
do
enthusiasm
faded
as
he
realized
that
only
half
of
the
problem
was
solved
the
bombs
would
drop
on
schedule
unless
the
nyjorders
could
understand
the
significance
of
this
discovery
even
if
they
understood
would
it
make
any
difference
to
them
the
threat
of
the
hidden
cobalt
bombs
would
not
be
changed
with
this
thought
came
the
guilty
realization
that
he
had
forgotten
completely
about
telt
death
even
before
he
contacted
the
nyjord
fleet
he
must
tell
hys
and
his
rebel
army
what
had
happened
to
telt
and
his
sand
car
also
about
the
radioactive
traces
they
be
checked
against
the
records
now
to
see
how
important
they
might
be
but
hys
might
make
another
raid
on
the
strength
of
the
suspicion
this
call
would
take
long
then
he
would
be
free
to
tackle
krafft
carefully
setting
the
transmitter
on
the
frequency
of
the
rebel
army
he
sent
out
a
call
to
hys
there
was
no
answer
when
he
switched
to
receive
all
he
heard
was
static
there
was
always
a
chance
the
set
was
broken
he
quickly
twisted
the
transmitter
to
the
frequency
of
his
personal
radio
then
whistled
in
the
microphone
the
received
signal
was
so
loud
that
it
hurt
his
ears
he
tried
to
call
hys
again
and
was
relieved
to
get
a
response
this
time
brion
brandd
here
can
you
read
me
i
want
to
talk
to
hys
at
once
it
came
as
a
shock
that
it
was
krafft
who
answered
i
sorry
brion
but
it
impossible
to
talk
to
hys
we
are
monitoring
his
frequency
and
your
call
was
relayed
to
me
hys
and
his
rebels
lifted
ship
about
half
an
hour
ago
and
are
already
on
the
way
back
to
nyjord
are
you
ready
to
leave
now
it
will
soon
become
dangerous
to
make
any
landings
even
now
i
will
have
to
ask
for
volunteers
to
get
you
out
of
there
hys
and
the
rebel
army
gone
brion
assimilated
the
thought
he
had
been
thrown
off
balance
when
he
realized
he
was
talking
to
krafft
if
they
gone
well
then
there
nothing
i
can
do
about
it
he
said
i
was
going
to
call
you
so
i
can
talk
to
you
now
listen
and
try
to
understand
you
must
cancel
the
bombing
i
found
out
about
the
magter
found
what
causes
their
mental
aberration
if
we
can
correct
that
we
can
stop
them
from
attacking
nyjord
can
they
be
corrected
by
midnight
tonight
krafft
broke
in
he
was
abrupt
and
sounded
almost
angry
even
saints
get
tired
no
of
course
not
brion
frowned
at
the
microphone
realizing
the
talk
was
going
all
wrong
but
not
knowing
how
to
remedy
it
but
it
wo
take
too
long
i
have
evidence
here
that
will
convince
you
that
what
i
say
is
the
truth
i
believe
you
without
seeing
it
brion
the
trace
of
anger
was
gone
from
krafft
voice
now
and
it
was
heavy
with
fatigue
and
defeat
i
admit
you
are
probably
right
a
little
while
ago
i
admitted
to
hys
too
that
he
was
probably
right
in
his
original
estimation
of
the
correct
way
to
tackle
the
problem
of
dis
we
have
made
a
lot
of
mistakes
and
in
making
them
we
have
run
out
of
time
i
afraid
that
is
the
only
fact
that
is
relevant
now
the
bombs
fall
at
twelve
and
even
then
they
may
drop
too
late
a
ship
is
already
on
its
way
from
nyjord
with
my
replacement
i
exceeded
my
authority
by
running
a
day
past
the
maximum
the
technicians
gave
me
i
realize
now
i
was
gambling
the
life
of
my
own
world
in
the
vain
hope
i
could
save
dis
they
ca
be
saved
they
dead
i
hear
any
more
about
it
you
must
listen
i
must
destroy
the
planet
below
me
that
is
what
i
must
do
that
fact
will
not
be
changed
by
anything
you
say
all
the
offworlders
other
than
your
party
are
gone
i
sending
a
ship
down
now
to
pick
you
up
as
soon
as
that
ship
lifts
i
am
going
to
drop
the
first
bombs
now
tell
me
where
you
are
so
they
can
come
for
you
do
threaten
me
krafft
brion
shook
his
fist
at
the
radio
in
an
excess
of
anger
you
a
killer
and
a
world
destroyer
do
try
to
make
yourself
out
as
anything
else
i
have
the
knowledge
to
avert
this
slaughter
and
you
wo
listen
to
me
and
i
know
where
the
cobalt
bombs
are
in
the
magter
tower
that
hys
raided
last
night
get
those
bombs
and
there
is
no
need
to
drop
any
of
your
own
i
sorry
brion
i
appreciate
what
you
trying
to
do
but
at
the
same
time
i
know
the
futility
of
it
i
not
going
to
accuse
you
of
lying
but
do
you
realize
how
thin
your
evidence
sounds
from
this
end
first
a
dramatic
discovery
of
the
cause
of
the
intransigency
then
when
that
had
no
results
you
suddenly
remember
that
you
know
where
the
bombs
are
the
magter
secret
i
do
know
for
sure
but
there
is
a
very
good
chance
it
is
so
brion
said
trying
to
repair
his
defenses
telt
made
readings
he
had
other
records
of
radioactivity
in
this
same
magter
keep
proof
that
something
is
there
but
telt
is
dead
now
the
records
destroyed
do
you
see
he
broke
off
realizing
how
vague
and
unprovable
his
case
was
this
was
defeat
the
radio
was
silent
with
just
the
hum
of
the
carrier
wave
as
krafft
waited
for
him
to
continue
when
brion
did
speak
his
voice
was
empty
of
all
hope
send
your
ship
down
he
said
tiredly
we
in
a
building
that
belonged
to
the
light
metals
trust
a
big
warehouse
of
some
kind
i
do
know
the
address
here
but
i
sure
you
have
someone
there
who
can
find
it
we
be
waiting
for
you
you
win
krafft
he
turned
off
the
radio
xvii
do
you
mean
what
you
said
about
giving
up
lea
asked
brion
realized
that
she
had
stopped
talking
to
ulv
some
time
ago
and
had
been
listening
to
his
conversation
with
krafft
he
shrugged
trying
to
put
his
feeling
into
words
we
tried
and
almost
succeeded
but
if
they
wo
listen
what
can
we
do
what
can
one
man
possibly
do
against
a
fleet
loaded
with
as
if
in
answer
to
the
question
ulv
voice
drowned
him
out
the
harsh
disan
words
slashing
the
silence
of
the
room
kill
you
the
enemy
he
said
kill
you
he
shouted
the
last
word
and
his
hand
flashed
to
his
belt
in
a
single
swift
motion
he
lifted
his
blowgun
and
placed
it
to
his
lips
a
tiny
dart
quivered
in
the
already
dead
flesh
of
the
creature
in
the
magter
skull
the
action
had
all
the
symbolism
of
a
broken
lance
the
declaration
of
war
ulv
understands
it
a
lot
better
than
you
might
think
lea
said
he
knows
things
about
symbiosis
and
mutualism
that
would
get
him
a
job
as
a
lecturer
in
any
university
on
earth
he
knows
just
what
the
is
and
what
it
does
they
even
have
a
word
for
it
one
that
never
appeared
in
our
disan
language
lessons
a
life
form
that
you
can
live
with
or
cooperate
with
is
called
one
that
works
to
destroy
you
is
he
also
understands
that
life
forms
can
change
and
be
or
at
different
times
he
has
just
decided
that
the
brain
symbiote
is
and
he
is
out
to
kill
it
so
will
the
rest
of
the
disans
as
soon
as
he
can
show
them
the
evidence
and
explain
you
sure
of
this
brion
asked
interested
in
spite
of
himself
positive
the
disans
have
an
absolute
attitude
towards
survival
you
should
realize
that
not
the
same
as
the
magter
but
not
much
different
in
the
results
they
will
kill
the
even
if
it
means
killing
every
magter
who
harbors
one
if
that
is
the
case
we
ca
leave
now
brion
said
with
these
words
it
suddenly
became
clear
what
he
had
to
do
the
ship
is
coming
down
now

in
it
and
take
the
body
of
the
magter
i
wo
go
where
will

be
she
asked
shocked
fighting
the
magter
my
presence
on
the
planet
means
that
krafft
wo
keep
his
threat
to
drop
the
bombs
any
earlier
than
the
midnight
deadline
that
would
be
deliberately
murdering
me
i
doubt
if
my
presence
past
midnight
will
stop
him
but
it
should
keep
the
bombs
away
at
least
until
then
what
will
you
accomplish
besides
committing
suicide
lea
pleaded
you
just
told
me
how
a
single
man
ca
stop
the
bombs
what
will
happen
to
you
at
midnight
i
be
dead
but
in
spite
of
that
i
ca
run
away
not
now
i
must
do
everything
possible
right
up
until
the
last
instant
ulv
and
i
will
go
to
the
magter
tower
try
to
find
out
if
the
bombs
are
there
he
will
fight
on
our
side
now
he
may
even
know
more
about
the
bombs
things
that
he
did
want
to
tell
me
before
we
can
get
help
from
his
people
some
of
them
must
know
where
the
bombs
are
being
native
to
this
planet
lea
started
to
say
something
but
he
rushed
on
drowning
out
her
words
you
have
just
as
big
a
job
show
the
magter
to
krafft
explain
the
significance
of
the
to
him
try
to
get
him
to
talk
to
hys
about
the
last
raid
try
to
get
him
to
hold
off
the
attack
keep
the
radio
with
me
and
as
soon
as
i
know
anything
i
call
in
this
is
all
last
resort
finger
in
the
dike
kind
of
stuff
but
it
is
all
we
can
do
because
if
we
do
nothing
it
means
the
end
of
dis
lea
tried
to
argue
with
him
but
he
would
listen
to
her
he
only
kissed
her
and
with
a
lightness
he
did
not
feel
tried
to
convince
her
that
everything
would
be
all
right
in
their
hearts
they
both
knew
it
would
be
but
they
left
it
that
way
because
it
was
the
least
painful
solution
a
sudden
rumbling
shook
the
building
and
the
windows
darkened
as
a
ship
settled
in
the
street
outside
the
nyjord
crew
came
in
with
guns
pointed
alert
for
anything
after
a
little
convincing
they
took
the
cadaver
as
well
as
lea
when
they
lifted
ship
brion
watched
the
spacer
become
a
pinpoint
in
the
sky
and
vanish
he
tried
to
shake
off
the
feeling
that
this
was
the
last
time
he
would
see
any
of
them
let
get
out
of
here
fast
he
told
ulv
picking
up
the
radio
before
anyone
comes
around
to
see
why
the
ship
landed
what
will
you
do
ulv
asked
as
they
went
down
the
street
towards
the
desert
what
can
we
do
in
the
few
hours
we
have
left
he
pointed
at
the
sun
nearing
the
horizon
brion
shifted
the
weight
of
the
radio
to
his
other
hand
before
replying
get
to
the
magter
tower
we
raided
last
night
that
the
best
chance
the
bombs
might
be
there
unless
you
know
where
the
bombs
are
ulv
shook
his
head
i
do
not
know
but
some
of
my
people
may
we
will
capture
a
magter
then
kill
him
so
they
can
all
see
the
then
they
will
tell
us
everything
they
know
the
tower
first
then
for
bombs
or
a
sample
magter
what
the
fastest
way
we
can
get
there
ulv
frowned
in
thought
if
you
can
drive
one
of
the
cars
the
offworlders
use
i
know
where
there
are
some
locked
in
buildings
in
this
city
none
of
my
people
know
how
they
are
made
to
move
i
can
work
them
let
go
chance
was
with
them
this
time
the
first
sand
car
they
found
still
had
the
keys
in
the
lock
it
was
but
contained
a
full
charge
much
quieter
than
the
heavy
atomic
cars
it
sped
smoothly
out
of
the
city
and
across
the
sand
ahead
of
them
the
sun
sank
in
a
red
wave
of
color
it
was
six
by
the
time
they
reached
the
tower
it
was
seven
and
brion
nerves
felt
as
if
they
were
writhing
under
his
skin
even
though
it
looked
like
suicide
attacking
the
tower
brought
blessed
relief
it
was
movement
and
action
and
for
moments
at
a
time
he
forgot
the
bombs
hanging
over
his
head
the
attack
was
anticlimactic
they
used
the
main
entrance
ulv
ranging
soundlessly
ahead
there
was
no
one
in
sight
once
inside
they
crept
down
towards
the
lower
rooms
where
the
radiation
had
been
detected
only
gradually
did
they
realize
that
the
magter
tower
was
completely
empty
everyone
gone
ulv
grunted
sniffing
the
air
in
every
room
that
they
passed
many
magter
were
here
earlier
but
they
are
gone
now
do
they
often
desert
their
towers
brion
asked
never
i
have
never
heard
of
it
happening
before
i
can
think
of
no
reason
why
they
should
do
a
thing
like
this
well
i
can
brion
told
him
they
would
leave
their
home
if
they
took
something
with
them
of
greater
value
the
bombs
if
the
bombs
were
hidden
here
they
might
move
them
after
the
attack
sudden
fear
hit
him
or
they
might
move
them
because
it
is
time
to
take
them
to
the
launcher
let
get
out
of
here
the
quickest
way
we
can
i
smell
air
from
outside
ulv
said
coming
from
down
there
this
can
not
be
because
the
magter
have
no
entrances
this
low
in
their
towers
we
blasted
one
in
earlier
that
could
be
it
can
you
find
it
moonlight
shone
ahead
as
they
turned
an
angle
of
the
corridor
and
stars
were
visible
through
the
gaping
opening
in
the
wall
it
looks
bigger
than
it
was
brion
said
as
if
the
magter
had
enlarged
it
he
looked
through
and
saw
the
tracks
on
the
sand
outside
as
if
they
had
enlarged
it
to
bring
something
bulky
up
from
below
and
carried
it
away
in
whatever
made
those
tracks
using
the
opening
themselves
they
ran
back
to
the
sand
car
brion
ground
it
fiercely
around
and
turned
the
headlights
on
the
tracks
there
were
the
marks
of
a
sand
car
treads
half
obscured
by
thin
unmarked
wheel
tracks
he
turned
off
the
lights
and
forced
himself
to
move
slowly
and
to
do
an
accurate
job
a
quick
glimpse
at
his
watch
showed
him
there
were
four
hours
left
to
go
the
moonlight
was
bright
enough
to
illuminate
the
tracks
driving
with
one
hand
he
turned
on
the
radio
transmitter
already
set
for
krafft
wave
length
when
the
operator
acknowledged
his
signal
brion
reported
what
they
had
discovered
and
his
conclusions
get
that
message
to
commander
krafft
now
i
ca
wait
to
talk
to
him
i
following
the
tracks
he
killed
the
transmission
and
stamped
on
the
accelerator
the
sand
car
churned
and
bounced
down
the
track
they
are
going
to
the
mountains
ulv
said
some
time
later
as
the
tracks
still
pointed
straight
ahead
there
are
caves
there
and
many
magter
have
been
seen
near
them
that
is
what
i
have
heard
the
guess
was
correct
before
nine
the
ground
humped
into
a
range
of
foothills
and
the
darker
masses
of
mountains
could
be
seen
behind
them
rising
up
to
obscure
the
stars
stop
the
car
here
ulv
said
the
caves
begin
not
too
far
ahead
there
may
be
magter
watching
or
listening
so
we
must
go
quietly
brion
followed
the
grooves
carrying
the
radio
ulv
came
and
went
on
both
sides
silently
as
a
shadow
scouting
for
hidden
watchers
as
far
as
he
could
discover
there
were
none
by
brion
realized
they
had
deserted
the
sand
car
too
soon
the
tracks
wound
on
and
on
and
seemed
to
have
no
end
they
passed
some
caves
which
ulv
pointed
out
to
him
but
the
tracks
never
stopped
time
was
running
out
and
the
nightmare
stumbling
through
the
darkness
continued
more
caves
ahead
ulv
said
go
quietly
they
came
cautiously
to
the
crest
of
a
hill
as
they
had
done
so
many
times
already
and
looked
into
the
shallow
valley
beyond
sand
covered
the
valley
floor
and
the
light
of
the
setting
moon
shone
over
the
tracks
at
a
flat
angle
marking
them
off
sharply
as
lines
of
shadow
they
ran
straight
across
the
sandy
valley
and
disappeared
into
the
dark
mouth
of
a
cave
on
the
far
side
sinking
back
behind
the
hilltop
brion
covered
the
pilot
light
with
his
hand
and
turned
on
the
transmitter
ulv
stayed
above
him
staring
at
the
opening
of
the
cave
this
is
an
important
message
brion
whispered
into
the
mike
please
record
he
repeated
this
for
thirty
seconds
glancing
at
his
watch
to
make
sure
of
the
time
since
the
seconds
of
waiting
stretched
to
minutes
in
his
brain
then
as
clearly
as
possible
without
raising
his
voice
above
a
whisper
he
told
of
the
discovery
of
the
tracks
and
the
cave
the
bombs
may
or
may
not
be
in
here
but
we
are
going
in
to
find
out
i
leave
my
personal
transmitter
here
with
the
broadcast
power
turned
on
so
you
can
home
on
its
signal
that
will
give
you
a
directional
beacon
to
find
the
cave
i
taking
the
other
radio
in
it
has
more
power
if
we
ca
get
back
to
the
entrance
i
try
a
signal
from
inside
i
doubt
if
you
will
hear
it
because
of
the
rock
but
i
try
end
of
transmission
do
try
to
answer
me
because
i
have
the
receiver
turned
off
there
are
no
earphones
on
this
set
and
the
speaker
would
be
too
loud
here
he
switched
off
held
his
thumb
on
the
button
for
an
instant
then
flicked
it
back
on
lea
he
said
and
killed
the
power
for
good
they
circled
and
reached
the
rocky
wall
of
the
cliff
creeping
silently
in
the
shadows
they
slipped
up
on
the
dark
entrance
of
the
cave
nothing
moved
ahead
and
there
was
no
sound
from
the
entrance
of
the
cave
brion
glanced
at
his
watch
and
was
instantly
sorry
the
last
shelter
concealing
them
was
five
metres
from
the
cave
they
started
to
rise
to
rush
the
final
distance
when
ulv
suddenly
waved
brion
down
he
pointed
to
his
nose
then
to
the
cave
he
could
smell
the
magter
there
a
dark
figure
separated
itself
from
the
greater
darkness
of
the
cave
mouth
ulv
acted
instantly
he
stood
up
and
his
hand
went
to
his
mouth
air
hissed
faintly
through
the
tube
in
his
hand
without
a
sound
the
magter
folded
and
fell
to
the
ground
before
the
body
hit
ulv
crouched
low
and
rushed
in
there
was
the
sudden
scuffling
of
feet
on
the
floor
then
silence
brion
walked
in
gun
ready
and
alert
not
knowing
what
he
would
find
his
toe
pushed
against
a
body
on
the
ground
and
from
the
darkness
ulv
whispered
there
were
only
two
we
can
go
on
now
finding
their
way
through
the
cave
was
a
maddening
torture
they
had
no
light
nor
would
they
dare
use
one
if
they
had
there
were
no
wheel
marks
to
follow
on
the
stone
floor
without
ulv
sensitive
nose
they
would
have
been
completely
lost
the
cave
branched
and
rejoined
and
they
soon
lost
all
sense
of
direction
walking
was
almost
impossible
they
had
to
grope
with
their
hands
before
them
like
blind
men
stumbling
and
falling
against
the
rock
their
fingers
were
soon
throbbing
and
raw
from
brushing
against
the
rough
walls
ulv
followed
the
scent
of
the
magter
that
hung
in
the
air
where
they
had
passed
when
it
grew
thin
he
knew
they
had
left
the
frequently
used
tunnels
and
entered
deserted
ones
they
could
only
retrace
their
steps
and
start
again
in
a
different
direction
more
maddening
than
the
walking
was
the
way
time
was
running
out
inexorably
the
glowing
hands
crept
around
the
face
of
brion
watch
until
they
stood
at
fifteen
minutes
before
twelve
there
is
a
light
ahead
ulv
whispered
and
brion
almost
gasped
with
relief
they
moved
slowly
and
silently
until
they
stood
concealed
by
the
darkness
looking
out
into
a
domed
chamber
brightly
lit
by
glowing
tubes
what
is
it
ulv
asked
blinking
in
the
painful
wash
of
illumination
after
the
long
darkness
brion
had
to
fight
to
control
his
voice
to
stop
from
shouting
the
cage
with
the
metal
webbing
is
a
generator
the
pointed
silver
shapes
next
to
it
are
bombs
of
some
kind
probably
the
cobalt
bombs
we
found
it
his
first
impulse
was
to
instantly
send
the
radio
call
that
would
stop
the
waiting
fleet
of
but
an
unconvincing
message
would
be
worse
than
no
message
at
all
he
had
to
describe
exactly
what
he
saw
here
so
the
nyjorders
would
know
he
was
lying
what
he
told
them
had
to
fit
exactly
with
the
information
they
already
had
about
the
launcher
and
the
bombs
the
launcher
had
been
from
a
ship
generator
that
was
obvious
the
generator
and
its
controls
were
neatly
cased
and
mounted
cables
ran
from
them
to
a
roughly
constructed
cage
of
woven
metal
straps
hammered
and
bent
into
shape
by
hand
three
technicians
were
working
on
the
equipment
brion
wondered
what
sort
of
the
magter
had
found
to
handle
the
bombing
for
them
then
he
saw
the
chains
around
their
necks
and
the
bloody
wounds
on
their
backs
he
still
found
it
difficult
to
have
any
pity
for
them
they
had
obviously
been
willing
to
accept
money
to
destroy
another
planet
or
they
would
have
been
working
here
they
had
probably
rebelled
only
when
they
had
discovered
how
suicidal
the
attack
would
be
thirteen
minutes
to
midnight
cradling
the
radio
against
his
chest
brion
rose
to
his
feet
he
had
a
better
view
of
the
bombs
now
there
were
twelve
of
them
alike
as
eggs
from
the
same
deadly
clutch
pointed
like
the
bow
of
a
spacer
each
one
swept
smoothly
back
for
its
two
metres
of
length
to
a
sharply
end
they
were
obviously
incomplete
the
war
heads
of
rockets
one
had
its
base
turned
towards
him
and
he
saw
six
projecting
studs
that
could
be
used
to
attach
it
to
the
missing
rocket
a
circular
inspection
port
was
open
in
the
flat
base
of
the
bomb
this
was
enough
with
this
description
the
nyjorders
would
know
he
could
be
lying
about
finding
the
bombs
once
they
realized
this
they
could
destroy
dis
without
first
trying
to
neutralize
them
brion
carefully
counted
fifty
paces
before
he
stopped
he
was
far
enough
from
the
cavern
so
he
could
be
heard
and
an
angle
of
the
cave
cut
off
all
light
from
behind
him
with
carefully
controlled
movements
he
turned
on
the
power
switched
the
set
to
transmit
and
checked
the
broadcast
frequency
all
correct
then
slowly
and
clearly
he
described
what
he
had
seen
in
the
cavern
behind
him
he
kept
his
voice
emotionless
recounting
facts
leaving
out
anything
that
might
be
considered
an
opinion
it
was
six
minutes
before
midnight
when
he
finished
he
thumbed
the
switch
to
receive
and
waited
there
was
only
silence
slowly
the
empty
quality
of
the
silence
penetrated
his
numbed
mind
there
were
no
crackling
atmospherics
nor
hiss
of
static
even
when
he
turned
the
power
full
on
the
mass
of
rock
and
earth
of
the
mountain
above
was
acting
as
a
perfect
grounding
screen
absorbing
his
signal
even
at
maximum
output
they
had
heard
him
the
nyjord
fleet
did
know
that
the
cobalt
bombs
had
been
discovered
before
their
launching
the
attack
would
go
ahead
as
planned
even
now
the
doors
were
opening
armed
hung
above
the
planet
held
in
place
only
by
their
shackles
in
a
few
minutes
the
signal
would
be
given
and
the
shackles
would
spring
open
the
bombs
drop
clear
killers
brion
shouted
into
the
microphone
you
would
listen
to
reason
you
would
listen
to
hys
or
me
or
to
any
voice
that
suggested
an
alternative
to
complete
destruction
you
are
going
to
destroy
dis
and
not
necessary
there
were
a
lot
of
ways
you
could
have
stopped
it
you
did
do
any
of
them
and
now
it
too
late
you
destroy
dis
and
in
turn
this
will
destroy
nyjord
ihjel
said
that
and
now
i
believe
him
you
just
another
damned
failure
in
a
galaxy
full
of
failures
he
raised
the
radio
above
his
head
and
sent
it
crashing
into
the
rock
floor
then
he
was
running
back
to
ulv
trying
to
run
away
from
the
realization
that
he
too
had
tried
and
failed
the
people
on
the
surface
of
dis
had
less
than
two
minutes
left
to
live
they
did
get
my
message
brion
said
to
ulv
the
radio
work
this
far
underground
then
the
bombs
will
fall
ulv
asked
looking
searchingly
at
brion
face
in
the
dim
reflected
light
from
the
cavern
unless
something
happens
that
we
know
nothing
about
the
bombs
will
fall
they
said
nothing
after
that
they
simply
waited
the
three
technicians
in
the
cavern
were
also
aware
of
the
time
they
were
calling
to
each
other
and
trying
to
talk
to
the
magter
the
emotionless
brains
of
the
magter
saw
no
reason
to
stop
work
and
they
attempted
to
beat
the
men
back
to
their
tasks
in
spite
of
the
blows
they
did
go
they
only
gaped
in
horror
as
the
clock
hands
moved
remorselessly
towards
twelve
even
the
magter
dimly
felt
some
of
the
significance
of
the
occasion
they
stopped
too
and
waited
the
hour
hand
touched
twelve
on
brion
watch
then
the
minute
hand
the
second
hand
closed
the
gap
and
for
a
tenth
of
a
second
the
three
hands
were
one
then
the
second
hand
moved
on
brion
immediate
sensation
of
relief
was
washed
away
by
the
chilling
realization
that
he
was
deep
underground
sound
and
seismic
waves
were
slow
and
the
flare
of
atomic
explosions
could
be
seen
here
if
the
bombs
had
been
dropped
at
twelve
they
would
know
it
at
once
a
distant
rumble
filled
the
air
a
moment
later
the
ground
heaved
under
them
and
the
lights
in
the
cavern
flickered
fine
dust
drifted
down
from
the
roof
above
ulv
turned
to
him
but
brion
looked
away
he
could
not
face
the
accusation
in
the
disan
eyes
xviii
one
of
the
technicians
was
running
and
screaming
the
magter
knocked
him
down
and
beat
him
into
silence
seeing
this
the
other
two
men
returned
to
work
with
shaking
hands
even
if
all
life
on
the
surface
of
the
planet
was
dead
this
would
have
no
effect
on
the
magter
they
would
go
ahead
as
planned
without
emotion
or
imagination
enough
to
alter
their
set
course
as
the
technicians
worked
their
attitude
changed
from
shocked
numbness
to
anger
right
and
wrong
were
forgotten
they
had
been
killed
the
invisible
death
of
radiation
must
already
be
penetrating
into
the
caves
but
they
also
had
the
chance
for
vengeance
swiftly
they
brought
their
work
to
completion
with
a
speed
and
precision
they
had
concealed
before
what
are
those
offworlders
doing
ulv
asked
brion
stirred
from
his
lethargy
of
defeat
and
looked
across
the
cavern
floor
the
men
had
a
wheeled
handtruck
and
were
rolling
one
of
the
atomic
warheads
onto
it
they
pushed
it
over
to
the
latticework
of
the
they
are
going
to
bomb
nyjord
now
just
as
nyjord
bombed
dis
that
machine
will
hurl
the
bombs
in
a
special
way
to
the
other
planet
will
you
stop
them
ulv
asked
he
had
his
deadly
blowgun
in
his
hand
and
his
face
was
an
expressionless
mask
brion
almost
smiled
at
the
irony
of
the
situation
in
spite
of
everything
he
had
done
to
prevent
it
nyjord
had
dropped
the
bombs
and
this
act
alone
may
have
destroyed
their
own
planet
brion
had
it
within
his
power
now
to
stop
the
launching
in
the
cavern
should
he
should
he
save
the
lives
of
his
killers
or
should
he
practice
the
ancient
that
had
echoed
and
destroyed
down
through
the
ages
eye
for
an
eye
a
tooth
for
a
it
would
be
so
simple
he
literally
had
to
do
nothing
the
score
would
be
even
and
his
and
the
disans
death
avenged
did
ulv
have
his
blowgun
ready
to
kill
brion
with
if
he
should
try
to
stop
the
launchings
or
had
he
misread
the
disan
entirely
will
stop
them
ulv
he
asked
how
large
was
mankind
sense
of
obligation
the
caveman
first
had
this
feeling
for
his
mate
then
for
his
family
it
grew
until
men
fought
and
died
for
the
abstract
ideas
of
cities
and
nations
then
for
whole
planets
would
the
time
ever
come
when
men
might
realize
that
the
obligation
should
be
to
the
largest
and
most
encompassing
reality
of
all
mankind
and
beyond
that
to
life
of
all
kinds
brion
saw
this
idea
not
in
words
but
as
a
reality
when
he
posed
the
question
to
himself
in
this
way
he
found
that
it
stated
clearly
its
inherent
answer
he
pulled
his
gun
out
and
as
he
did
he
wondered
what
ulv
answer
might
be
nyjord
is
ulv
said
raising
his
blowgun
and
sending
a
dart
across
the
cavern
it
struck
one
of
the
technicians
who
gasped
and
fell
to
the
floor
brion
shots
crashed
into
the
control
board
shorting
and
destroying
it
removing
the
menace
to
nyjord
for
all
time
ulv
had
said
a
life
form
that
cooperates
and
aids
other
life
forms
it
may
kill
in
but
it
is
essentially
not
a
killer
or
destroyer
ulv
had
a
lifetime
of
knowledge
about
the
interdependency
of
life
he
grasped
the
essence
of
the
idea
and
ignored
all
the
verbal
complications
and
confusions
he
had
killed
the
magter
who
were
his
own
people
because
they
were
against
life
and
he
had
saved
his
enemies
because
they
were
with
this
realization
came
the
painful
knowledge
that
the
planet
and
the
people
that
had
produced
this
understanding
were
dead
in
the
cavern
the
magter
saw
the
destruction
of
their
plans
and
the
cave
mouth
from
which
the
bullets
had
come
silently
they
rushed
to
kill
their
enemy
a
concerted
wave
of
emotionless
fury
brion
and
ulv
fought
back
even
the
knowledge
that
he
was
doomed
no
matter
what
happened
could
not
resign
brion
to
death
at
the
hands
of
the
magter
to
ulv
the
decision
was
much
easier
he
was
simply
killing
a
believer
in
life
he
destroyed
the
they
retreated
into
the
darkness
still
firing
the
magter
had
lights
and
ion
rifles
and
were
right
behind
them
knowing
the
caverns
better
than
the
men
they
chased
the
pursuers
circled
brion
saw
lights
ahead
and
dragged
ulv
to
a
stop
they
know
their
way
through
these
caves
and
we
do
he
said
if
we
try
to
run
they
just
shoot
us
down
let
find
a
spot
we
can
defend
and
settle
into
it
back
here
ulv
gave
a
tug
in
the
right
direction
there
is
a
cave
with
only
one
entrance
and
that
is
very
narrow
let
go
running
as
silently
as
they
could
in
the
darkness
they
reached
the
deadend
cavern
without
being
seen
what
noise
they
made
was
lost
in
other
footsteps
that
sounded
and
echoed
through
the
connecting
caves
once
inside
they
found
cover
behind
a
ridge
and
waited
the
end
was
certain
the
magter
ran
swiftly
into
their
cave
flashing
his
light
into
all
the
places
of
concealment
the
beam
passed
over
the
two
hidden
men
and
at
the
same
instant
brion
fired
the
shot
boomed
loudly
as
the
magter
fell
a
shot
that
would
surely
have
been
heard
by
the
others
before
anyone
else
came
into
the
cave
brion
ran
over
and
grabbed
the
still
functioning
light
propping
it
on
the
rocks
so
it
shone
on
the
entrance
he
hurried
back
to
shelter
beside
ulv
they
waited
for
the
attack
it
was
not
long
in
coming
two
magter
rushed
in
and
died
more
were
outside
brion
knew
and
he
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
they
remembered
the
grenades
and
rolled
one
into
their
shelter
an
indistinct
murmur
sounded
outside
and
sharp
explosions
in
their
hiding
place
brion
and
ulv
crouched
low
and
wondered
why
the
attack
did
come
then
one
of
the
magter
came
in
the
entrance
but
brion
hesitated
before
shooting
the
man
had
in
firing
behind
him
as
he
came
ulv
had
no
compunctions
about
killing
only
his
darts
penetrate
the
magter
thick
clothing
as
the
magter
turned
breath
pulsed
once
and
death
stung
the
back
of
the
other
man
hand
he
collapsed
into
a
crumpled
heap
do
shoot
a
voice
called
from
outside
the
cave
and
a
man
stepped
through
the
swirling
dust
and
smoke
to
stand
in
the
beam
from
the
light
brion
clutched
wildly
at
ulv
arm
dragging
the
blowgun
from
the
disan
mouth
the
man
in
the
light
wore
a
protective
helmet
thick
boots
and
a
uniform
he
was
a
nyjorder
the
realization
was
almost
impossible
to
accept
brion
had
heard
the
bombs
fall
yet
the
nyjord
soldier
was
here
the
two
facts
could
be
accepted
together
would
you
keep
a
hold
on
his
arm
sir
just
in
case
the
soldier
said
glancing
warily
at
ulv
blowpipe
i
know
what
those
darts
can
do
he
pulled
a
microphone
from
one
of
his
pockets
and
spoke
into
it
more
soldiers
crowded
into
the
cave
and
krafft
came
in
behind
them
he
looked
strangely
out
of
keeping
in
the
dusty
combat
uniform
the
gun
was
even
more
incongruous
in
his
hand
after
giving
the
pistol
to
the
nearest
soldier
with
an
air
of
relief
he
stumbled
quickly
over
to
brion
and
took
his
hand
it
is
a
profound
and
sincere
pleasure
to
meet
you
in
person
he
said
and
your
friend
ulv
as
well
would
you
kindly
explain
what
is
going
on
brion
said
thickly
he
was
obsessed
by
the
strange
feeling
that
none
of
this
could
possibly
be
happening
we
will
always
remember
you
as
the
man
who
saved
us
from
ourselves
krafft
said
once
again
the
professor
instead
of
the
commander
what
brion
wants
are
facts
grandpa
not
speeches
hys
said
the
bent
form
of
the
leader
of
the
rebel
nyjord
army
pushed
through
the
crowd
of
taller
men
until
he
stood
next
to
krafft
simply
stated
brion
your
plan
succeeded
krafft
relayed
your
message
to
me
and
as
soon
as
i
heard
it
i
turned
back
and
met
him
on
his
ship
sorry
that
telt
dead
but
he
found
what
we
were
looking
for
i
could
ignore
his
report
of
radioactive
traces
your
girl
friend
arrived
with
the
corpse
at
the
same
time
i
did
and
we
all
took
a
long
look
at
the
green
leech
in
its
skull
her
explanation
of
what
it
is
made
significant
sense
we
were
already
carrying
out
landings
when
we
had
your
call
about
something
having
been
stored
in
the
magter
tower
after
that
it
was
just
a
matter
of
following
tracks
and
the
transmitter
you
planted
but
the
explosions
at
midnight
brion
broke
in
i
heard
them
you
were
supposed
to
hys
laughed
not
only
you
but
the
magter
in
this
cave
we
figured
they
would
be
armed
and
the
cave
strongly
defended
so
at
midnight
we
dropped
a
few
large
chemical
explosive
bombs
at
the
entrance
enough
to
kill
the
guards
without
bringing
the
roof
down
we
also
hoped
that
the
magter
deeper
in
would
leave
their
posts
or
retreat
from
the
imagined
radiation
and
they
did
it
worked
like
a
charm
we
came
in
quietly
and
took
them
by
surprise
made
a
clean
sweep
killed
the
ones
we
could
capture
one
of
the
renegade
technicians
was
still
alive
krafft
said
he
told
us
about
your
stopping
the
bombs
aimed
at
nyjord
the
two
of
you
none
of
the
nyjorders
there
could
add
anything
to
his
words
not
even
the
cynical
hys
but
brion
could
empathize
their
feelings
the
warmth
of
their
intense
relief
and
happiness
it
was
a
sensation
he
would
never
forget
there
is
no
more
war
brion
translated
for
ulv
knowing
that
the
disan
had
understood
nothing
of
the
explanation
as
he
said
it
he
realized
that
there
was
one
glaring
error
in
the
story
you
could
have
done
it
brion
said
you
landed
on
this
planet
you
had
my
message
about
the
tower
that
means
you
still
expected
the
magter
to
be
sending
their
bombs
to
nyjord
and
you
made
the
landings
in
spite
of
this
knowledge
of
course
professor
krafft
said
astonished
at
brion
lack
of
understanding
what
else
could
we
do
the
magter
are
sick
hys
laughed
aloud
at
brion
baffled
expression
you
have
to
understand
nyjord
psychology
he
said
when
it
was
a
matter
of
war
and
killing
my
planet
could
never
agree
on
an
intelligent
course
war
is
so
alien
to
our
philosophy
that
it
could
even
be
considered
correctly
that
the
trouble
with
being
a
vegetable
eater
in
a
galaxy
of
carnivores
you
easy
prey
for
the
first
one
that
lands
on
your
back
any
other
planet
would
have
jumped
on
the
magter
with
both
feet
and
shaken
the
bombs
out
of
them
we
fumbled
it
so
long
it
almost
got
both
worlds
killed
your
drew
us
back
from
the
brink
i
do
understand
brion
said
a
simple
matter
of
definition
before
you
came
we
had
no
way
to
deal
with
the
magter
here
on
dis
they
really
were
alien
to
us
nothing
they
did
made
sense
and
nothing
we
did
seemed
to
have
the
slightest
effect
on
them
but
you
discovered
that
they
were
and
that
something
we
know
how
to
handle
we
united
again
my
rebel
army
was
instantly
absorbed
into
the
rest
of
the
nyjord
forces
by
mutual
agreement
doctors
and
nurses
are
on
the
way
here
now
plans
were
put
under
way
to
evacuate
what
part
of
the
population
we
could
until
the
bombs
were
found
the
planet
is
united
again
and
working
hard
because
the
magter
are
sick
infected
by
a
destructive
life
form
brion
asked
exactly
so
professor
krafft
said
we
are
civilized
after
all
you
ca
expect
us
to
fight
a
war
and
you
surely
ca
expect
us
to
ignore
the
plight
of
sick
neighbors
no
you
surely
ca
brion
said
sitting
down
heavily
he
looked
at
ulv
to
whom
the
speech
had
been
incomprehensible
beyond
him
hys
wore
his
most
cynical
expression
as
he
considered
the
frailties
of
his
people
hys
brion
called
out
you
translate
all
that
into
disan
and
explain
to
ulv
i
would
dare
xix
dis
was
a
floating
golden
ball
looking
like
a
schoolroom
globe
in
space
no
clouds
obscured
its
surface
and
from
this
distance
it
seemed
warm
and
attractive
set
against
the
cold
darkness
brion
almost
wished
he
were
back
there
now
as
he
sat
shivering
inside
the
heavy
coat
he
wondered
how
long
it
would
be
before
his
confused
controls
decided
to
turn
off
the
summer
adjustment
he
hoped
it
would
be
as
sudden
or
as
drastic
as
turning
it
on
had
been
delicate
as
a
dream
lea
reflection
swam
in
space
next
to
the
planet
she
had
come
up
quietly
behind
him
in
the
corridor
only
her
gentle
breath
and
mirrored
face
telling
him
she
was
there
he
turned
quickly
and
took
her
hands
in
his
you
looking
infinitely
better
he
said
well
i
should
she
said
pushing
back
her
hair
in
an
unconscious
gesture
with
her
hand
i
been
doing
nothing
but
lying
in
the
ship
hospital
while
you
were
having
such
a
fine
time
this
last
week
rushing
around
down
there
shooting
all
the
magter
just
gassing
them
he
told
her
the
nyjorders
ca
bring
themselves
to
kill
any
more
even
if
it
does
raise
their
own
casualty
rate
in
fact
they
are
having
difficulty
restraining
the
disans
led
by
ulv
who
are
happily
killing
any
magter
they
see
as
being
pure
what
will
they
do
when
they
have
all
those
frothing
magter
madmen
they
do
know
yet
he
said
they
wo
really
know
until
they
see
what
an
adult
magter
is
like
with
his
dead
and
gone
they
having
better
luck
with
the
children
if
they
catch
them
early
enough
the
parasite
can
be
destroyed
before
it
has
done
too
much
damage
lea
shuddered
delicately
and
let
herself
lean
against
him
i
not
that
sturdy
yet
let
sit
down
while
we
talk
there
was
a
couch
opposite
the
viewport
where
they
could
sit
and
still
see
dis
i
hate
to
think
of
a
magter
deprived
of
his
symbiote
she
said
if
his
system
can
stand
the
shock
i
imagine
there
will
be
nothing
left
except
a
brainless
hulk
this
is
one
series
of
experiments
i
do
care
to
witness
i
rest
secure
in
the
knowledge
that
the
nyjorders
will
find
the
most
humane
solution
i
sure
they
will
brion
said
now
what
about
us
she
said
disconcertingly
leaning
back
in
his
arms
i
must
say
you
have
the
highest
body
temperature
of
any
one
i
have
ever
touched
it
positively
exciting
this
jarred
brion
even
more
he
did
have
her
ability
to
put
past
horrors
out
of
the
mind
by
substituting
present
pleasures
well
just
what
about
us
he
said
with
masterful
inappropriateness
she
smiled
as
she
leaned
against
him
you
were
as
vague
as
that
the
night
in
the
hospital
room
i
seem
to
remember
a
few
other
things
you
said
and
did
you
ca
claim
you
completely
indifferent
to
me
brion
brandd
so
i
only
asking
you
what
any
outspoken
anvharian
girl
would
where
do
we
go
from
here
get
married
there
was
a
definite
pleasure
in
holding
her
slight
body
in
his
arms
and
feeling
her
hair
against
his
cheek
they
both
sensed
it
and
this
awareness
made
his
words
sound
that
much
more
ugly
lea
darling
you
know
how
important
you
are
to
me
but
you
certainly
realize
that
we
could
never
get
married
her
body
stiffened
and
she
tore
herself
away
from
him
why
you
great
fat
egotistical
slab
of
meat
what
do
you
mean
by
that
i
like
you
lea
we
have
plenty
of
fun
and
games
together
but
surely
you
realize
that
you
are
the
kind
of
girl
one
takes
home
to
mother
lea
hold
on
he
said
you
know
better
than
to
say
a
thing
like
that
what
i
said
has
nothing
to
do
with
how
i
feel
towards
you
but
marriage
means
children
and
you
are
biologist
enough
to
know
about
earth
genes
intolerant
yokel
she
cried
slapping
his
face
he
did
move
or
attempt
to
stop
her
i
expected
better
from
you
with
all
your
pretensions
of
understanding
but
all
you
can
think
of
are
the
horror
stories
about
the
genes
of
earth
you
the
same
as
every
other
big
strapping
bigot
from
the
frontier
planets
i
know
how
you
look
down
on
our
small
size
our
allergies
and
haemophilia
and
all
the
other
weaknesses
that
have
been
bred
back
and
preserved
by
the
race
you
hate
but
that
not
what
i
meant
at
all
he
interrupted
shocked
his
voice
drowning
hers
out
yours
are
the
strong
genes
the
viable
strains
are
the
deadly
ones
a
child
of
mine
would
kill
itself
and
you
in
a
natural
birth
if
it
managed
to
live
to
term
you
forgetting
that
you
are
the
original
homo
sapiens
i
a
recent
mutation
lea
was
frozen
by
his
words
they
revealed
a
truth
she
had
known
but
would
never
permit
herself
to
consider
earth
is
home
the
planet
where
mankind
developed
he
said
the
last
few
thousand
years
you
may
have
been
breeding
weaknesses
back
into
the
genetic
pool
but
that
nothing
compared
to
the
hundred
millions
of
years
that
it
took
to
develop
man
how
many
newborn
babies
live
to
be
a
year
of
age
on
earth
why
almost
all
of
them
a
fraction
of
one
per
cent
die
each
year
i
ca
recall
exactly
how
many
earth
is
home
he
said
again
gently
when
men
leave
home
they
can
adapt
to
different
planets
but
a
price
must
be
paid
a
terrible
price
is
in
dead
infants
the
successful
mutations
live
the
failures
die
natural
selection
is
a
brutally
simple
affair
when
you
look
at
me
you
see
a
success
i
have
a
sister
a
success
too
yet
my
mother
had
six
other
children
who
died
when
they
were
still
babies
and
several
others
that
never
came
to
term
you
know
about
these
things
do
you
lea
i
know
i
know
she
said
sobbing
into
her
hands
he
held
her
now
and
she
did
pull
away
i
know
it
all
as
a
biologist
but
i
am
so
awfully
tired
of
being
a
biologist
and
top
of
my
class
and
a
mental
match
for
any
man
when
i
think
about
you
i
do
it
as
a
woman
and
ca
admit
any
of
this
i
need
someone
brion
and
i
needed
you
so
much
because
i
loved
you
she
paused
and
wiped
her
eyes
you
going
home
are
you
back
to
anvhar
when
i
ca
wait
too
long
he
said
unhappily
aside
from
my
personal
wants
i
find
myself
remembering
that
i
a
part
of
anvhar
when
you
think
of
the
number
of
people
who
suffered
and
died
or
adapted
so
that
i
could
be
sitting
here
now
well
it
a
little
frightening
i
suppose
it
does
make
sense
logically
that
i
should
feel
indebted
to
them
but
i
do
anything
i
do
now
or
in
the
next
few
years
wo
be
as
important
as
getting
back
to
anvhar
and
i
wo
be
going
back
with
you
it
was
a
flat
statement
the
way
she
said
it
not
a
question
no
you
wo
be
he
said
there
is
nothing
on
anvhar
for
you
lea
was
looking
out
of
the
port
at
dis
and
her
eyes
were
dry
now
way
back
in
my
deeply
buried
unconscious
i
think
i
knew
it
would
end
this
way
she
said
if
you
think
your
little
lecture
on
the
origins
of
man
was
a
novelty
it
was
it
just
reminded
me
of
a
number
of
things
my
glands
had
convinced
me
to
forget
in
a
way
i
envy
you
your
weightlifter
and
your
happy
kiddies
but
not
very
much
very
early
in
life
i
resigned
myself
to
the
fact
that
there
was
no
one
on
earth
i
would
care
to
marry
i
always
had
these
dreams
of
a
hero
from
space
who
would
carry
me
off
and
i
guess
i
slipped
you
into
the
pattern
without
realizing
it
i
old
enough
now
to
face
the
fact
that
i
like
my
work
more
than
a
banal
marriage
and
i
probably
end
up
a
frigid
and
virtuous
old
maid
with
more
degrees
and
titles
than
you
have
records
as
they
looked
through
the
port
dis
began
slowly
to
contract
their
ship
drew
away
from
it
heading
towards
nyjord
they
sat
apart
without
touching
now
leaving
dis
meant
leaving
behind
something
they
had
shared
they
had
been
strangers
together
there
on
a
strange
world
for
a
brief
time
their
lifelines
had
touched
that
time
was
over
now
do
we
look
happy
hys
said
shambling
towards
them
fall
dead
and
make
me
even
happier
then
lea
snapped
bitterly
hys
ignored
the
acid
tone
of
her
words
and
sat
down
on
the
couch
next
to
them
since
leaving
command
of
his
rebel
nyjord
army
he
seemed
much
mellower
going
to
keep
on
working
for
the
cultural
relationships
foundation
brion
he
asked
you
the
kind
of
man
we
need
brion
eyes
widened
as
the
meaning
of
the
last
words
penetrated
are
you
in
the
field
agent
for
nyjord
he
said
i
hope
you
do
think
those
helpless
office
types
like
faussel
or
mervv
really
represented
us
there
they
just
took
notes
and
acted
as
a
front
and
cover
for
the
organization
nyjord
is
a
fine
planet
but
a
gentle
guiding
hand
behind
the
scenes
is
needed
to
help
them
find
their
place
in
the
galaxy
before
they
are
pulverized
what
your
dirty
game
hys
lea
asked
scowling
i
had
enough
hints
to
suspect
for
a
long
time
that
there
was
more
to
the
than
the
part
i
have
seen
are
you
people
egomaniacs
power
hungry
or
what
that
the
first
charge
that
would
be
leveled
at
us
if
our
activities
were
publicly
known
hys
told
her
that
why
we
do
most
of
our
work
under
cover
the
best
fact
i
can
give
you
to
counter
the
charge
is
just
where
do
you
think
we
get
the
funds
for
an
operation
this
size
he
smiled
at
their
blank
looks
you
see
the
records
later
so
there
wo
be
any
doubt
the
truth
is
that
all
our
funds
are
donated
by
planets
we
have
helped
even
a
tiny
percentage
of
a
planetary
income
is
large
add
enough
of
them
together
and
you
have
enough
money
to
help
other
planets
and
voluntary
gratitude
is
a
perfect
test
if
you
stop
to
think
about
it
you
ca
talk
people
into
liking
what
you
have
done
they
have
to
be
convinced
there
have
always
been
people
on
worlds
who
knew
about
our
work
and
agreed
with
it
enough
to
see
that
we
are
kept
in
funds
why
are
you
telling
me
all
this
stuff
lea
asked
is
that
obvious
we
want
you
to
keep
on
working
for
us
you
can
name
whatever
salary
you
like
as
i
said
there
is
no
shortage
of
ready
cash
hys
glanced
quickly
at
them
both
and
delivered
the
clinching
argument
i
hope
brion
will
go
on
working
with
us
too
he
is
the
kind
of
field
agent
we
desperately
need
and
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
just
show
me
where
to
sign
lea
said
and
there
was
life
in
her
voice
once
again
i
would
exactly
call
it
blackmail
brion
smiled
but
i
suppose
if
you
people
can
juggle
planetary
psychologies
you
must
find
that
individuals
can
be
pushed
around
like
chessmen
though
you
should
realize
that
very
little
pushing
is
required
this
time
will
you
sign
on
hys
asked
i
must
go
back
to
anvhar
brion
said
but
there
really
is
no
pressing
hurry
earth
said
lea
is
overpopulated
enough
as
it
is
hours
in
hell
dis
was
a
harsh
inhospitable
dangerous
place
and
the
magter
made
it
worse
they
might
have
been
human
once
but
they
were
something
else
now
the
magter
had
only
one
desire
kill
kill
everything
themselves
their
planet
the
universe
if
they
could
brion
brandd
was
sent
in
at
the
eleventh
hour
his
mission
was
to
save
dis
but
it
looked
as
though
he
was
going
to
preside
over
its
annihilation
planet
of
the
damned
