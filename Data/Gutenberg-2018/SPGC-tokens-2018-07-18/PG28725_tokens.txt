tinkler
and
the
moonflower
dickie
lived
at
new
cross
at
least
the
address
was
new
cross
but
really
the
house
where
he
lived
was
one
of
a
row
of
horrid
little
houses
built
on
the
slope
where
once
green
fields
ran
down
the
hill
to
the
river
and
the
old
houses
of
the
deptford
merchants
stood
stately
in
their
pleasant
gardens
and
fruitful
orchards
all
those
good
fields
and
happy
gardens
are
built
over
now
it
is
as
though
some
wicked
giant
had
taken
a
big
brush
full
of
yellow
ochre
paint
and
another
full
of
mud
color
and
had
painted
out
the
green
in
streaks
of
dull
yellow
and
filthy
brown
and
the
brown
is
the
roads
and
the
yellow
is
the
houses
miles
and
miles
and
miles
of
them
and
not
a
green
thing
to
be
seen
except
the
cabbages
in
the
greengrocers
shops
and
here
and
there
some
poor
trails
of
drooping
from
a
dirty
there
is
a
little
yard
at
the
back
of
each
house
this
is
called
the
garden
and
some
of
these
show
green
but
they
only
show
it
to
the
houses
back
windows
you
can
not
see
it
from
the
street
these
gardens
are
green
because
green
is
the
color
that
most
pleases
and
soothes
men
eyes
and
however
you
may
shut
people
up
between
bars
of
yellow
and
mud
color
and
however
hard
you
may
make
them
work
and
however
little
wage
you
may
pay
them
for
working
there
will
always
be
found
among
those
people
some
men
who
are
willing
to
work
a
little
longer
and
for
no
wages
at
all
so
that
they
may
have
green
things
growing
near
them
but
there
were
no
green
things
growing
in
the
garden
at
the
back
of
the
house
where
dickie
lived
with
his
aunt
there
were
stones
and
bones
and
bits
of
brick
and
dirty
old
matted
together
with
grease
and
mud
and
broken
shovels
a
bottomless
pail
and
the
mouldy
remains
of
a
hutch
where
once
rabbits
had
lived
but
that
was
a
very
long
time
ago
and
dickie
had
never
seen
the
rabbits
a
boy
had
brought
a
brown
rabbit
to
school
once
buttoned
up
inside
his
jacket
and
he
had
let
dickie
hold
it
in
his
hands
for
several
minutes
before
the
teacher
detected
its
presence
and
shut
it
up
in
a
locker
till
school
should
be
over
so
dickie
knew
what
rabbits
were
like
and
he
was
fond
of
the
hutch
for
the
sake
of
what
had
once
lived
there
and
when
his
aunt
sold
the
poor
remains
of
the
hutch
to
a
man
with
a
barrow
who
was
ready
to
buy
anything
and
who
took
also
the
pails
and
the
shovels
giving
threepence
for
the
lot
dickie
was
almost
as
unhappy
as
though
the
hutch
had
really
held
a
furry
friend
and
he
hated
the
man
who
took
the
hutch
away
all
the
more
because
there
were
empty
hanging
sadly
from
the
back
of
the
barrow
it
is
really
with
the
going
of
that
that
this
story
begins
because
it
was
then
that
dickie
having
called
his
aunt
a
beast
and
hit
at
her
with
his
little
dirty
fist
was
well
slapped
and
put
out
into
the
bereaved
yard
to
come
to
himself
as
his
aunt
said
he
threw
himself
down
on
the
ground
and
cried
and
wriggled
with
misery
and
pain
and
wished
ah
many
things
wot
the
bloomin

the
man

the

leaning
on
his
spade

was

one
of
the
green
ones
there
were
small
grubby
daffodils
in
it
and
little
primroses
and
an
arbor
beside

garden

to

a
handkerchief

dickie
went
he
went
slowly
because
he
was
lame
and
he
was
lame
because
his
aunt
had
dropped
him
when
he
was
a
baby
she
was
not
a
nice
woman
and
i
am
glad
to
say
that
she
goes
out
of
this
story
almost
at
once
but
she
did
keep
dickie
when
his
father
died
and
she
might
have
sent
him
to
the
for
she
was
not
really
his
aunt
but
just
the
woman
of
the
house
where
his
father
had
lodged
it
was
good
of
her
to
keep
dickie
even
if
she
was
very
kind
to
him
and
as
that
is
all
the
good
i
can
find
to
say
about
her
i
will
say
no
more
with
his
little
crutch
made
out
of
a
broom
cut
down
to
his
little
height
he
could
manage
quite
well
in
spite
of
his
lameness
illustration
gim
me
said
dickie
gim
me
a
o
that
there
he
found
the
a
really
charming
shop
that
smelled
like
stables
and
had
deep
dusty
bins
where
he
would
have
liked
to
play
above
the
bins
were
delightful
little
drawers
labelled
rape
hemp
canary
millet
mustard
and
so
on
and
above
the
drawers
pictures
of
the
kind
of
animals
that
were
fed
on
the
kind
of
things
that
the
shop
sold
fat
oblong
cows
that
had
eaten
burley
cattle
food
stout
pillows
of
wool
that
ovis
sheep
spice
had
fed
and
brightest
and
best
of
all
an
incredibly
parrot
cocking
a
black
eye
bright
with
the
intoxicating
qualities
of
perrokett
artistic
bird
seed
gim
me
said
dickie
leaning
against
the
counter
and
pointing
a
grimy
thumb
at
the
wonder
gim
me
a
o
that
there
got
the
penny
the
shopman
asked
carefully
dickie
displayed
it
parted
with
it
and
came
home
nursing
a
paper
bag
full
of
rustling
promises
why
said
the
man
next
door
that
ai
seeds
it
parrot
food
that
is
it
said
the
bird
seed
said
dickie
downcast
i
thought
it
come
into
flowers
like
birds
same
colors
as
wot
the
poll
parrot
was
dontcherknow
and
so
it
will
like
as
not
said
the
man
next
door
comfortably
set
it
along
this
end
soon
i
got
it
turned
over
i
lay
it
come
up
something
pretty
so
the
seed
was
sown
and
the
man
next
door
promised
two
more
pennies
later
for
seed
also
he
transplanted
two
of
the
primroses
whose
faces
wanted
washing
it
was
a
grand
day
for
dickie
he
told
the
whole
story
of
it
that
night
when
he
went
to
bed
to
his
only
confidant
from
whom
he
hid
nothing
the
confidant
made
no
reply
but
dickie
was
sure
this
was
not
because
the
confidant
did
care
about
the
story
the
confidant
was
a
blackened
stick
about
five
inches
long
with
little
blackened
bells
to
it
like
the
bells
on
dogs
collars
also
a
rather
crooked
bit
of
something
whitish
and
very
hard
good
to
suck
or
to
stroke
with
your
fingers
or
to
dig
holes
in
the
soap
with
dickie
had
no
idea
what
it
was
his
father
had
given
it
to
him
in
the
hospital
where
dickie
was
taken
to
say
to
him
had
to
be
said
because
of
father
having
fallen
off
the
scaffolding
where
he
was
at
work
and
not
getting
better
you
stick
to
that
father
had
said
looking
dreadfully
clean
in
the
strange
bed
among
all
those
other
clean
beds
it
yourn
your
very
own
my
dad
give
it
to
me
and
it
belonged
to
his
dad
do
you
let
any
one
take
it
away
some
old
lady
told
the
old
man
it
bring
us
luck
so
long
old
chap
dickie
remembered
every
word
of
that
speech
and
he
kept
the
treasure
there
had
been
another
thing
with
it
tied
on
with
string
but
aunt
maud
had
found
that
and
taken
it
away
to
take
care
of
and
he
had
never
seen
it
again
it
was
brassy
with
a
white
stone
and
some
sort
of
pattern
on
it
he
had
the
treasure
and
he
had
not
the
least
idea
what
it
was
with
its
bells
that
jangled
such
pretty
music
and
its
white
spike
so
hard
and
smooth
he
did
not
know
but
i
know
it
was
a
rattle
a
baby
rattle
or
if
you
would
rather
call
it
that
a
coral
and
bells
and
we
shall
the
fairest
flowers
of
hill
and
dale
said
dickie
whispering
comfortably
in
his
dirty
sheets
and
greensward
oh
tinkler
dear
indeed
be
a
fair
scene
the
gayest
colors
of
the
rainbow
amid
the
ague
able
green
of
fresh
leaves
i
do
love
the
man
next
door
he
has
indeed
a
of
gold
that
was
how
dickie
talked
to
his
friend
tinkler
you
know
how
he
talked
to
his
aunt
and
the
man
next
door
i
wonder
whether
you
know
that
most
children
can
speak
at
least
two
languages
even
if
they
have
never
had
a
foreign
nurse
or
been
to
foreign
climes
or
whether
you
think
that
you
are
the
only
child
who
can
do
this
believe
me
you
are
not
parents
and
guardians
would
be
surprised
to
learn
that
dear
little
charlie
has
a
language
quite
different
from
the
one
he
uses
to
them
a
language
in
which
he
talks
to
the
cook
and
the
housemaid
and
yet
another
language
spoken
with
the
real
accent
too
in
which
he
converses
with
the
and
the
grooms
dickie
however
had
learned
his
second
language
from
books
the
teacher
at
his
school
had
given
him
six
children
of
the
new
forest
quentin
durward
hereward
the
wake
and
three
others
all
they
made
a
new
world
for
dickie
and
since
the
people
in
books
talked
in
this
nice
if
odd
way
he
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
to
a
friend
whom
he
could
trust
i
hope
you
not
getting
bored
with
all
this
you
see
i
must
tell
you
a
little
about
the
kind
of
boy
dickie
was
and
the
kind
of
way
he
lived
or
you
wo
understand
his
adventures
and
he
had
adventures
no
end
of
adventures
as
you
will
see
presently
dickie
woke
gay
as
the
spring
sun
that
was
trying
to
look
in
at
him
through
his
grimy
windows
perhaps
he
do
some
more
to
the
garden
he
said
and
got
up
very
quickly
he
got
up
in
the
dirty
comfortless
room
and
dressed
himself
but
in
the
evening
he
was
undressed
by
kind
clean
hands
and
washed
in
a
big
bath
of
hot
silvery
water
with
soap
that
smelled
like
the
at
the
end
of
the
street
because
going
along
to
school
with
his
silly
little
head
full
of
artistic
bird
seeds
and
flowers
he
had
let
his
crutch
slip
on
a
and
had
tumbled
down
and
a
butcher
cart
had
gone
over
his
poor
lame
foot
so
they
took
the
hurt
foot
to
the
hospital
and
of
course
he
had
to
go
with
it
and
the
hospital
was
much
more
like
the
heaven
he
read
of
in
his
books
than
anything
he
had
ever
come
across
before
he
noticed
that
the
nurses
and
the
doctors
spoke
in
the
kind
of
words
that
he
had
found
in
his
books
and
in
a
voice
that
he
had
not
found
anywhere
so
when
on
the
second
day
a
smiling
lady
in
a
white
cap
said
well
tommy
and
how
are
we
he
replied
my
name
is
far
from
being
tommy
and
i
am
in
lux
ury
and
af
fluence
i
thank
you
gracious
lady
at
which
the
lady
laughed
and
pinched
his
cheek
when
she
grew
to
know
him
better
and
found
out
where
he
had
learned
to
talk
like
that
she
produced
more
books
and
from
them
he
learned
more
new
words
they
were
very
nice
to
him
at
the
hospital
but
when
they
sent
him
home
they
put
his
lame
foot
into
a
thick
boot
with
a
horrid
clumpy
sole
and
iron
things
that
went
up
his
leg
his
aunt
and
her
friends
said
how
kind
but
dickie
hated
it
the
boys
at
school
made
game
of
it
they
had
got
used
to
the
crutch
and
that
was
worse
than
being
called
old
which
was
what
dickie
had
got
used
to
so
used
that
it
seemed
almost
like
a
pet
name
and
on
that
first
night
of
his
return
he
found
that
he
had
been
robbed
they
had
taken
his
tinkler
from
the
safe
corner
in
his
bed
where
the
ticking
was
broken
and
there
was
a
soft
flock
nest
for
a
boy
best
friend
he
knew
better
than
to
ask
what
had
become
of
it
instead
he
searched
and
searched
the
house
in
all
its
five
rooms
but
he
never
found
tinkler
instead
he
found
next
day
when
his
aunt
had
gone
out
shopping
a
little
square
of
cardboard
at
the
back
of
the
dresser
drawer
among
the
dirty
dusters
and
clothes
pegs
and
string
and
corks
and
novelettes
it
was
a
rattle
one
shilling
dickie
knew
all
about
you
of
course
do
well
ask
some
person
to
explain
i
have
time
i
want
to
get
on
with
the
story
illustration
a
moonflower
of
course
he
said
until
he
had
found
that
ticket
he
had
not
been
able
to
think
of
anything
else
he
had
not
even
cared
to
think
about
his
garden
and
wonder
whether
the
artistic
bird
seeds
had
come
up
he
had
been
a
very
long
time
in
the
hospital
and
it
was
august
now
and
the
nurses
had
assured
him
that
the
seeds
must
be
up
long
ago
he
would
find
everything
flowering
you
see
if
he
did
and
now
he
went
out
to
look
there
was
a
tangle
of
green
growth
at
the
end
of
the
garden
and
the
next
garden
was
full
of
weeds
for
the
man
next
door
had
gone
off
to
look
for
work
down
ashford
way
where
the
are
and
the
house
was
to
let
a
few
poor
little
pink
and
yellow
flowers
showed
stunted
among
the
green
where
he
had
sowed
the
artistic
bird
seed
and
towering
high
above
everything
else
oh
three
times
as
high
as
dickie
himself
there
was
a
flower
a
great
flower
like
a
sunflower
only
white
why
said
dickie
it
as
big
as
a
it
was
it
stood
up
beautiful
and
stately
and
turned
its
face
towards
the
sun
the
stalk
like
a
little
tree
said
dickie
and
so
it
was
it
had
great
drooping
leaves
and
a
dozen
smaller
white
flowers
stood
out
below
it
on
long
stalks
thinner
than
that
needed
to
support
the
moonflower
itself
it
a
moonflower
of
course
he
said
if
the
other
sunflowers
i
love
it
i
love
it
i
love
it
he
did
not
allow
himself
much
time
for
loving
it
however
for
he
had
business
in
hand
he
had
somehow
or
other
to
get
a
shilling
because
without
a
shilling
he
could
not
exchange
that
square
of
cardboard
with
rattle
on
it
for
his
one
friend
tinkler
and
with
the
shilling
he
could
this
is
part
of
the
dismal
magic
of
which
some
will
kindly
explain
to
you
i
ca
get
money
by
the
sweat
of
my
brow
said
dickie
to
himself
nobody
would
let
me
run
their
errands
when
they
could
get
a
boy
with
both
legs
to
do
them
not
likely
i
wish
i
got
something
i
could
sell
he
looked
round
the
yard
dirtier
and
nastier
than
ever
now
in
the
parts
that
the
man
next
door
had
not
had
time
to
dig
there
was
certainly
nothing
there
that
any
one
would
want
to
buy
especially
now
the
was
gone
except
why
of
course
the
moonflowers
he
got
the
old
knife
out
of
the
bowl
on
the
back
kitchen
sink
where
it
nestled
among
potato
peelings
like
a
flower
among
foliage
and
carefully
cut
half
a
dozen
of
the
smaller
flowers
then
he
limped
up
to
new
cross
station
and
stood
outside
leaning
on
his
crutch
and
holding
out
the
flowers
to
the
people
who
came
crowding
out
of
the
station
after
the
arrival
of
each
train
thick
black
crowds
of
tired
people
in
too
great
a
hurry
to
get
home
to
their
teas
to
care
much
about
him
or
his
flowers
everybody
glanced
at
them
for
they
were
wonderful
flowers
as
white
as
only
flat
the
real
sunflower
shape
and
their
centres
were
of
the
purest
yellow
gold
color
pretty
ai
they
one
person
would
say
to
another
and
the
other
would
reply
no
yes
i
dunno
hurry
up
ca
you
it
was
no
good
dickie
was
tired
and
the
flowers
were
beginning
to
droop
he
turned
to
go
home
when
a
sudden
thought
brought
the
blood
to
his
face
he
turned
again
quickly
and
went
straight
to
the
pawnbroker
you
may
be
quite
sure
he
had
learned
the
address
on
the
card
by
heart
he
went
boldly
into
the
shop
which
had
three
handsome
gold
balls
hanging
out
above
its
door
and
in
its
window
all
sorts
of
pretty
things
rings
and
chains
and
brooches
and
watches
and
china
and
silk
handkerchiefs
and
concertinas
well
young
man
said
the
stout
gentleman
behind
the
counter
what
can
we
do
for
you
i
want
to
pawn
my
moonflowers
said
dickie
the
stout
gentleman
roared
with
laughter
and
slapped
a
stout
leg
with
a
stout
hand
well
that
a
good
he
said
as
good
a
one
as
ever
i
heard
why
you
little
duffer
they
be
dead
long
before
you
came
back
to
redeem
them
that
certain
you
have
them
while
they
were
alive
you
know
said
dickie
gently
what
are
they
do
seem
up
to
much
though
i
do
know
that
i
ever
saw
a
flower
just
like
them
come
to
think
of
it
said
the
pawnbroker
who
lived
in
a
neat
villa
at
brockley
and
went
in
for
gardening
in
a
gentlemanly
sort
of
way
they
moonflowers
said
dickie
and
i
want
to
pawn
them
and
then
get
something
else
out
with
the
money
got
the
ticket
said
the
gentleman
cleverly
seeing
that
he
meant
get
out
of
pawn
yes
said
dickie
and
it
my
own
tinkler
that
my
daddy
gave
me
before
he
died
and
my
aunt
missa
propagated
it
when
i
was
in
hospital
the
man
looked
carefully
at
the
card
all
right
he
said
at
last
hand
over
the
flowers
they
are
not
so
bad
he
added
more
willing
to
prize
them
now
that
they
were
his
things
do
look
different
when
they
are
your
own
do
they
here
humphreys
put
these
in
a
jug
of
water
till
i
go
home
and
get
this
out
illustration
humphreys
put
these
in
a
jug
of
water
till
i
go
home
a
pale
young
man
in
spectacles
appeared
from
a
sort
of
dark
cave
at
the
back
of
the
shop
took
flowers
and
ticket
and
was
swallowed
up
again
in
the
darkness
of
the
cave
oh
thank
you
said
dickie
fervently
i
shall
live
but
to
repay
your
bounteous
none
of
your
cheek
said
the
pawnbroker
reddening
and
there
was
an
awkward
pause
it
not
cheek
i
meant
it
said
dickie
at
last
speaking
very
earnestly
you
see
some
of
these
days
i
read
an
interesting
nar
rataive
about
a
lion
the
king
of
beasts
and
a
mouse
that
small
and
ty
morous
animal
which
if
you
have
not
heard
it
i
will
now
pur
seed
to
relite
you
a
rum
little
kid
i
do
think
said
the
man
where
do
you
learn
such
talk
it
the
wye
they
talk
in
books
said
dickie
suddenly
returning
to
the
language
of
his
aunt
you
bein
a
toff
i
thought
you
unnerstand
my
mistike
no
mean
to
say
you
can
talk
like
a
book
when
you
like
and
cut
it
off
short
like
that
i
can
like
lords
and
lydies
said
dickie
in
the
accents
of
the
gutter
and
your
noble
benefacteriness
made
me
seek
to
express
my
feelinks
with
the
best
words
at
me
command
fond
of
books
i
believe
you
said
dickie
and
there
were
no
more
awkward
pauses
when
the
pale
young
man
came
back
with
something
wrapped
in
a
bit
of
clean
rag
he
said
a
whispered
word
or
two
to
the
pawnbroker
who
unrolled
the
rag
and
looked
closely
at
the
rattle
so
it
is
he
said
and
it
a
beauty
too
let
alone
anything
else
is
he
said
dickie
touched
by
this
praise
of
his
treasured
tinkler
i
got
something
else
here
that
got
the
same
crest
as
your
rattle
crest
said
dickie
is
that
what
you
wear
on
your
helmet
in
the
heat
and
press
of
the
tower
nament
the
pawnbroker
explained
that
crests
no
longer
live
exclusively
on
helmets
but
on
all
sorts
of
odd
things
and
the
queer
little
animal
drawn
in
fine
scratches
on
the
side
of
the
rattle
was
it
seemed
a
crest
here
humphreys
he
added
give
it
a
rub
up
and
bring
that
seal
here
the
pale
young
man
did
something
to
tinkler
with
some
pinky
powder
and
a
brush
and
a
while
his
master
fitted
together
the
two
halves
of
a
broken
white
cornelian
it
came
out
of
a
seal
he
said
and
i
do
mind
making
you
a
present
of
it
oh
said
dickie
you
are
a
real
rightern
and
he
rested
his
crutch
against
the
counter
expressly
to
clasp
his
hands
in
ecstasy
as
boys
in
books
did
my
young
man
shall
stick
it
together
with
cement
the
pawnbroker
went
on
and
put
it
in
a
little
box
do
you
take
it
out
till
and
it
be
stuck
fast
only
do
go
trying
to
seal
with
it
or
the
will
melt
the
cement
it
bring
you
luck
i
wonder
it
did
and
such
luck
as
the
kind
pawnbroker
never
dreamed
of
but
that
comes
further
on
in
the
story
dickie
left
the
shop
without
his
moonflowers
indeed
but
with
his
tinkler
now
whitely
shining
and
declared
to
be
real
silver
and
mind
you
take
care
of
it
my
lad
his
white
cornelian
seal
carefully
packed
in
a
strong
little
cardboard
box
with
metal
corners
also
a
copy
of
ingoldsby
legends
and
one
of
english
history
which
had
no
back
at
all
you
must
go
on
trying
to
improve
your
mind
said
the
pawnbroker
fussily
he
was
very
pleased
with
himself
for
having
been
so
kind
and
come
back
and
see
me
say
next
month
i
will
said
dickie
a
thousand
blessings
from
a
grateful
heart
i
will
come
back
i
say
you
are
good
thank
you
thank
you
i
will
come
back
next
month
and
tell
you
everything
i
have
learned
from
the
perru
sal
of
your
books
perusal
said
the
pawnbroker
that
the
way
to
pernounce
it
my
man
and
next
month
but
next
month
found
dickie
in
a
very
different
place
from
the
pawnbroker
shop
and
with
a
very
different
person
from
the
pawnbroker
who
in
his
rural
retirement
at
brockley
gardened
in
such
a
gentlemanly
way
dickie
went
home
his
aunt
was
still
out
his
books
told
him
that
treasure
is
best
hidden
under
loose
boards
unless
of
course
your
house
has
a
secret
panel
which
his
had
not
there
was
a
loose
board
in
his
room
where
the
man
saw
to
the
gas
he
got
it
up
and
pushed
his
treasures
as
far
in
as
he
could
along
the
rough
crumbly
surface
of
the
lath
and
plaster
not
a
moment
too
soon
for
before
the
board
was
coaxed
quite
back
into
its
place
the
voice
of
the
aunt
screamed
up
come
along
down
ca
you
i
can
hear
you
pounding
about
up
there
come
along
down
and
fetch
me
a
o
wood
i
ca
get
the
kettle
to
boil
without
a
fire
can
i
when
dickie
came
down
his
aunt
slightly
slapped
him
and
he
took
the
halfpenny
and
limped
off
obediently
it
was
a
very
long
time
indeed
before
he
came
back
because
before
he
got
to
the
shop
with
no
window
to
it
but
only
shutters
that
were
put
up
at
night
where
the
wood
and
coal
were
sold
he
saw
a
punch
and
judy
show
he
had
never
seen
one
before
and
it
interested
him
extremely
he
longed
to
see
it
unpack
itself
and
display
its
wonders
and
he
followed
it
through
more
streets
than
he
knew
and
when
he
found
that
it
was
not
going
to
unpack
at
all
but
was
just
going
home
to
its
bed
in
an
old
he
remembered
the
and
the
halfpenny
clutched
tight
and
close
in
his
hand
seemed
to
reproach
him
warmly
he
looked
about
him
and
knew
that
he
did
not
at
all
know
where
he
was
there
was
a
tall
thin
ragged
man
lounging
against
a
stable
door
in
the
yard
where
the
punch
and
judy
show
lived
he
took
his
clay
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
to
say
what
up
matey
lost
your
way
dickie
explained
it
lavender
terrace
where
i
live
he
ended
lavender
terrace
rosemary
street
deptford
i
going
that
way
myself
said
the
man
getting
away
from
the
wall
we
go
back
by
the
boat
if
you
like
ever
been
on
the
boat
no
said
dickie
like
to
do
mind
if
i
do
said
dickie
it
was
very
pleasant
with
the
steamboat
going
along
in
such
a
hurry
pushing
the
water
out
of
the
way
and
puffing
and
blowing
and
something
beating
inside
it
like
a
giant
heart
the
wind
blew
freshly
and
the
ragged
man
found
a
sheltered
corner
behind
the
funnel
it
was
so
sheltered
and
the
wind
had
been
so
strong
that
dickie
felt
sleepy
when
he
said
i
bin
asleep
the
steamer
was
stopping
at
a
pier
at
a
strange
place
with
trees
here
we
are
said
the
man

asleep
not
stir
yourself
my
man
we
get
off
here
is
this
deptford
dickie
asked
and
the
people
shoving
and
crushing
to
get
off
the
steamer
laughed
when
he
said
it
not
exackly
said
the
man
but
it
all
right
this
where
we
get
off

one
egg

the
man

the
butter
and
as
many
cups
of
tea

way

the
man
scratched
his
head
and
hesitated
then
he
looked
up
at

sky
and
then
down
at
the
road
they
were
resting
on
a
heap
of
stones
at

the

beams
through
the
gaps
in
the
hedge
a
bird
paused
in
its
flight
on
a
branch
quite
close
and
clung
there
swaying
a
real
live
bird
dickie
thought
of
the
kitchen
at
home
the
lamp
that
smoked
the
dirty
table
the
fender
full
of
ashes
and
dirty
paper
the
dry
bread
that
tasted
of
mice
and
the
water
out
of
the
broken
earthenware
cup
that
would
be
his
breakfast
when
he
had
gone
to
bed
crying
after
his
aunt
had
slapped
him

he
and

took
out
of
his
pocket
a
new
envelope
a
new
sheet
of
paper
and
a
new
pencil
ready
sharpened
by
machinery
it
almost
looked
dickie
thought
as
though
he
had
brought
them
out
for
some
special
purpose
perhaps
he
had
now
said
the
man
you

an
write

flat
agin
the
sole
of
me
boot
he
lay
face
downward
on
the
road
and
turned
up
his
boot
as
though

were
the
most
natural
in
the
world

dickie

we
sleep
in
the

what
the
author
of
hereward
meant
it
to
mean
laying
out
under
a
or
a
or
such
and
lookin
up
at
the
stars
till

an
jolly
good
business
too
fine
weather
an
then
you
it
a
bit
and
resties
a
bit
and
some
one
gives
you
something
to
you
along
the
road
and
in
the
evening
you
a
glass
of
ale
at
the
publy
kows
and

another
set
o
green
bed

an
on

sunday

and
washes
of
your
shirt

adventures
asked
dick
recognizing
in
this
description
a
rough
sketch
of
the
life
of
a
modern
i
believe
you
said
the
man
why
only
last
month
a
brute
of
a
dog
bit
me
in
the
leg
at
a
back
door
sutton
way
an
once
i
see
a
elephant
wild
asked
dickie
thrilling
not
azackly
wild
with
a
circus
was
but
big
wild
ones
ai
the
size
i
lay
and
you
meets
soldiers
and
parties
in
red
coats
ridin
on
horses
with
spotted
dawgs
and
motors
as
run
you
down
and
take
your
off
afore
you
know
you
dead
if
you
do
look
alive
adventures
i
should
think
so
ah
said
dickie
and
a
full
silence
fell
between
them
tired
asked
beale
presently
just
a
tiddy
bit
said
dickie
bravely
but
i
can
stick
it
we
get
summat
with
wheels
for
you
said
the
man
if
only
a
an
i
can
tie
that
leg
of
yours
up
to
make
it
look
like
as
if
it
was
cut
off
it
this
nasty
boot
as
makes
me
tired
said
dickie
hoff
with
it
said
the
man
obligingly
down
you
sets
on
them
stones
and
hoff
with
it
too
if
you
like
you
can
keep
to
the
grass
the
dewy
grass
felt
pleasantly
cool
and
clean
to
dickie
tired
little
foot
and
when
they
crossed
the
road
where
a
had
dripped
it
was
delicious
to
feel
the
cool
mud
squeeze
up
between
your
toes
that
was
charming
but
it
was
pleasant
too
to
wash
the
mud
off
on
the
wet
grass
dickie
always
remembered
that
moment
it
was
the
first
time
in
his
life
that
he
really
enjoyed
being
clean
in
the
hospital
you
were
almost
too
clean
and
you
did
do
it
yourself
that
made
all
the
difference
yet
it
was
the
memory
of
the
hospital
that
made
him
say
i
wish
i
could
a
bath
so
you
shall
said
beale
a
wash
all
over
this
very
night
i
always
like
a
wash
meself
some
blokes
think
it
pays
to
be
dirty
but
it
do
if
you
clean
they
say
poverty
an
if
you
dirty
they
say
you
right
we
get
a
pail
or
something
this
very
night
you
good
said
dickie
i
do
like
you
beale
looked
at
him
through
the
deepening
twilight
rather
queerly
dickie
thought
also
he
sighed
heavily
oh
well
all
well
as
has
no
turning
and
things
do
always
what
i
mean
to
say
you
be
a
good
boy
and
i
do
the
right
thing
by
you
i
know
you
will
said
dickie
with
enthusiasm
know
good
you
are
bless
me
said
beale
uncomfortably
well
there
step
out
sonny
or
we
never
get
there
this
side
christmas
now
you
see
that
beale
may
be
a
cruel
wicked
man
who
only
wanted
to
get
hold
of
dickie
so
as
to
make
money
out
of
him
and
he
may
be
going
to
be
very
unkind
indeed
to
dickie
when
once
he
gets
him
away
into
the
country
and
is
all
alone
with
him
and
his
having
that
paper
and
envelope
and
pencil
all
ready
looks
odd
does
it
or
he
may
be
a
really
benevolent
person
well
you
know
all
about
it
presently
and
here
we
are
said
beale
stopping
in
a
at
an
open
door
from
which
yellow
light
streamed
welcomingly
now
mind
you
contradict
anything
wot
i
say
to
people
and
do
you
forget
you
my
nipper
and
you
got
to
call
me
daddy
i
call
you
farver
said
dickie
i
got
a
daddy
of
my
own
you
know
why
said
beale
stopping
suddenly
you
said
he
was
dead
so
he
is
said
dickie
but
my
daddy
all
the
same
oh
come
on
said
beale
impatiently
and
they
went
in
chapter
ii
burglars
dickie
fell
asleep
between
clean
coarse
sheets
in
a
hard
narrow
bed
for
which
fourpence
had
been
paid
put
yer
clobber
under
yer
bolster
likewise
yer
boots
was
the
last
instruction
of
his
new
friend
and
father
there
had
been
a
bath
or
something
equally
cleansing
in
a
pail
near
a
fire
where
ragged
but
agreeable
people
were
cooking
herrings
sausages
and
other
delicacies
on
little
gridirons
or
pans
that
they
unrolled
from
the
strange
bundles
that
were
their
luggage
one
man
who
had
no
gridiron
cooked
a
piece
of
steak
on
the
kitchen
tongs
dickie
thought
him
very
clever
a
very
fat
woman
asked
dickie
to
toast
a
herring
for
her
on
a
bit
of
wood
and
when
he
had
done
it
she
gave
him
two
green
apples
he
laid
in
bed
and
heard
jolly
voices
talking
and
singing
in
the
kitchen
below
and
he
thought
how
pleasant
it
was
to
be
a
tramp
and
what
jolly
fellows
the
tramps
were
for
it
seemed
that
all
these
nice
people
were
on
the
road
and
this
place
where
the
kitchen
was
and
the
good
company
and
the
clean
bed
for
fourpence
was
a
tramps
hotel
one
of
many
that
are
scattered
over
the
country
and
called
common
the
singing
and
laughing
went
on
long
after
he
had
fallen
asleep
and
if
later
in
the
evening
there
were
arguments
or
quarrels
even
dickie
did
not
hear
them
next
morning
quite
early
they
took
the
road
from
some
mysterious
source
beale
had
obtained
an
old
double
perambulator
which
must
have
been
made
dickie
thought
for
very
fat
twins
it
was
so
broad
and
roomy
artfully
piled
on
the
front
part
was
all
the
furniture
needed
by
travellers
who
mean
to
sleep
every
night
at
the
inn
of
the
silver
moon
that
is
the
inn
where
they
have
the
beds
with
the
green
curtains
what
all
that
there
dickie
asked
pointing
to
the
odd
knobbly
bundles
of
all
sorts
and
shapes
tied
on
to
the
perambulator
front
all
our
truck
what
we
want
on
the
road
said
beale
and
that
pillowy
bundle
on
the
seat
that
our
clothes
i
bought
you
a
little
jacket
to
put
on
o
nights
if
it
cold
or
wet
an
when
you
want
a
lift
why
here
your
carriage
and
you
can
sit
up
and
ride
like
the
lord
mayor
and
be
yer
horse
the
bundles
set
on
yer
knee
like
a
fat
babby
tell
yer
what
mate
looks
to
me
as
if
i
took
a
fancy
to
you
i
to
you
i
know
that
said
dickie
settling
his
crutch
firmly
and
putting
his
hand
into
beale
beale
looked
down
at
the
touch
swelp
me
he
said
helplessly
then
does
it
hurt
you
walking
not
like
it
did
i
went
to
the
orspittle
they
said
i
be
able
to
walk
to
rights
if
i
wore
that
there
beastly
boot
but
that
worsen
anythink
well
said
beale
you
sing
out
when
you
get
tired
and
i
give
yer
a
ride
oh
look
said
dickie
the
flowers
they
only
weeds
said
beale
they
were
in
fact
convolvuluses
little
pink
ones
with
their
tendrils
and
leaves
laid
flat
to
the
dry
earth
by
the
wayside
and
in
a
below
the
road
level
big
white
ones
twining
among
osiers
and
willows
dickie
filled
his
hands
with
the
pink
ones
and
beale
let
him
they
die
directly
he
said
but
i
shall
have
them
while
they
alive
said
dickie
as
he
had
said
to
the
pawnbroker
about
the
moonflowers
it
was
a
wonderful
day
all
the
country
sights
and
sounds
that
you
hardly
notice
because
you
have
known
them
every
year
as
long
as
you
can
remember
were
wonderful
magic
to
the
little
boy
from
deptford
the
green
hedge
the
cows
looking
over
them
the
tinkle
of
the
baa
of
the
sheep
the
black
pigs
in
a
sty
close
to
the
road
their
breathless
rooting
and
grunting
and
the
shiny
blackleaded
cylinders
that
were
their
bodies
the
stubbly
fields
where
barley
stood
in
sheaves
real
barley
like
the
people
next
door
but
three
gave
to
their
hens
the
woodland
shadows
and
the
lights
of
sudden
water
shoulders
of
brown
upland
pressed
against
the
open
sky
the
shrill
thrill
of
the
skylark
song
like
canary
birds
got
loose
the
splendor
of
distance
you
never
see
distance
in
deptford
the
magpie
that
perched
on
a
stump
and
cocked
a
bright
eye
at
the
travellers
the
thing
that
rustled
a
long
length
through
dead
leaves
in
a
beech
coppice
and
was
it
appeared
a
real
live
snake
all
these
made
the
journey
a
royal
progress
to
dickie
of
deptford
he
forgot
that
he
was
lame
forgot
that
he
had
run
away
a
fact
that
had
cost
him
a
twinge
or
two
of
fear
or
conscience
earlier
in
the
morning
he
was
happy
as
a
prince
is
happy
to
his
inheritance
and
it
was
beale
after
all
who
was
the
first
to
remember
that
there
was
a
carriage
in
which
a
tired
little
boy
might
ride
in
you
gets
he
said
suddenly
you
be
fair
knocked
you
can
look
about
you
just
as
well
down
he
added
laying
the
crutch
across
the
front
of
the
perambulator
never
see
such
a
nipper
for
noticing
neither
hi
there
goes
a
rabbit
see
crost
the
road
there
see
him
dickie
saw
and
the
crown
was
set
on
his
happiness
a
rabbit
like
the
ones
that
his
fancy
had
put
in
the
mouldering
hutch
at
home
it
got
loose
said
dickie
trying
to
scramble
out
of
the
perambulator
let
catch
and
take
along
ai
loose
wild
beale
explained
ai
never
bin
caught
lives
out
with
little
friendses
he
added
after
a
violent
effort
of
imagination
in
in
the
ground
gets
own
meals
and
larks
about
on
own
how
beautiful
said
dickie
wriggling
with
delight
this
life
of
the
rabbit

described
by
beale

the
child

glimpse
of
freedom

but

nipper
little
bit
o
pleasure
not
for
no
shilling
i
would
he
ended
nobly
with
a
fond
look
at
dickie
illustration
only
pawns
for
a
shillin

dickie
you
a
kind
father
said
the
lady
yes

he
mother
said
the
little
girl
may
i
give
the
little
boy
my
penny
the
two
travellers
were
left
facing
each
other
the
richer
by
a
penny
and
oh
wonderful
good
fortune
a
whole
they
exchanged
such
glances
as
might
pass
between
two
actors
as
the
curtain
goes
down
on
a
successful
dramatic
performance
you
did
that
bit
fine
said
beale
fine
you
did
you
been
there
before
ai
ye
no
i
never
said

the
steever
you
stick
to
that
said
beale
radiant
with
delight
you
a
fair
masterpiece
you
are
you
earned
it
honest
if
ever
a
kid
done
pats
you
on
the
napper
she
does
and
out
with
a
dollar
a
bit
of
all
right
i
call
it
they
went
on
up
the
hill
as
happy
as
any
one
need
wish
to
be
they
had
told
lies
you
observe
and
had
by
these
lies
managed
to
get
half
a
crown
and
a
penny
out
of
the
charitable
and
far
from
being
ashamed
of
their
acts
they
were
bubbling
over
with
merriment
and
delight
at
their
own
cleverness
please
do
not
be
too
shocked
remember
that
neither
of
them
knew
any
better
to
the
elder
tramp
lies
and
begging
were
natural
means
of
livelihood
to
the
little
tramp
the
whole
thing
was
a
new
and
entrancing
game
of
by
evening
they
had
us
a
fourpenny
doss
outer
this
said
beale
swelp
me
bob
we
be
ridin
in
our
own
moty
afore
we
know
where
we
are
at
this
rate
but
you
said
the
bed
with
the
green
curtains
urged
dickie
well
you
right
lay
up
for
a
rainy
day
eh
which
this
ai
not
by
no
means
there
a
a
bit
out
of
the
town
if
i
remember
right
come
on
mate
and
dickie
for
the
first
time
slept
have
you
ever
slept
the
night
is
full
of
interesting
little
sounds
that
will
not
at
first
let
you
sleep
the
rustle
of
little
wild
things
in
the
hedges
the
barking
of
dogs
in
distant
farms
the
chirp
of
crickets
and
the
croaking
of
frogs
and
in
the
morning
the
birds
wake
you
and
you
curl
down
warm
among
the
hay
and
look
up
at
the
sky
that
is
growing
lighter
and
lighter
and
breathe
the
chill
sweet
air
and
go
to
sleep
again
wondering
how
you
have
ever
been
able
to
lie
of
nights
in
one
of
those
boxes
with
holes
in
them
which
we
call
houses
the
new
game
of
begging
and
inventing
stories
to
interest
the
people
from
whom
it
was
worth
while
to
beg
went
on
gaily
day
by
day
and
week
by
week
and
dickie
by
constant
practice
grew
so
clever
at
taking
his
part
in
the
acting
that
beale
was
quite
dazed
with
admiration
blessed
if
i
ever
see
such
a
nipper
he
said
over
and
over
again
and
when
they
got
nearly
to
hythe
and
met
with
the
man
who
got
up
suddenly
out
of
the
hedge
and
said

hanging
off
and
on
expecting
them
for
nigh
on
a
week
beale
sent
dickie
into
a
field
to
look
for
mushrooms
which
did
grow
there
expressly
that
he
might
have
a
private
conversation
with
the
man

conversation
which

a
rare
old
beano
i

full
of
questions
but
beale
had
no
answers
for
them
you
jes
wait
hold
on
a
bit
them
as
lives
longest
sees
most
these
were
the
sort
of
remarks
which
were
all
that
dickie
could
get
out
of
him
it
was
not
the
next
day
which
was
a
saturday
that
they
took
the
train
like
dukes
nor
was
it
sunday
on
which
they
took
a
rest
and
washed
their
shirts
according
to
beale
rule
of
life
they
took
the
train
on
monday
and
it
landed
them
in
a
very
bright
town
by
the
sea
its
pavements
were
of
red
brick
and
its
houses
of
white
stone
and
its
and
balconies
were
green
and
dickie
thought
it
was
the
prettiest
town
in
the
world
they
did
not
stay
there
but
walked
out
across
the
downs
where
the
skylarks
were
singing
and
on
a
dip
of
the
downs
came
upon
great
stone
walls
and
towers
very
strong
and
gray
what
that
there
said
dickie
it
a
carstle
like
wot
the
king
got
at
windsor
is
it
a
king
as
lives
then
dickie
asked
no
nobody
do
live
mate
said
beale
it
a
ruin

is
only
howls
and
rats

in
ruins

any
one
ever
live
in
it
i

beale
indifferently
yes

they
must
come
to
think
of
it

till
the
jolting
perambulator
came
to
anchor
in
a
hollow
place
among
thick
furze
bushes
the
bare
thick
stems
of
the
furze
held
it
up
like
a
roof
over
their
heads
as
they
sat
it
was
like
a
little
furze
house
next
morning
beale
shaved
a
thing

not
done
since
they
left

the

it
was
great
fun
and
afterwards
beale

quite
different

great
fun
too
and
he
got
quite
a
different
set
of
clothes
out
of
his
bundles
and
put
them
on
and
that
was
the
greatest
fun
of

small
earnest
face

up
to

you
a
little
nipper
he
said
affectionately

bold
knight

like
here
ward
when
he
dressed
in
the
potter
clothes
and
went
to
see
king
william
he
spoke
in
the
book
voice
there
you
go
said
beale
but
do
you
go
and
talk
to
like
that
if
they
pinches
you
they
never
let
you
loose
again
think
got
a
marquis
in
disguise
so
they
would
dickie
thought
all
day
about
this
great
adventure
he
did
not
tell
beale
so
but
he
was
very
proud
of
being
so
trusted
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
burgling
must
be
a
very
exciting
profession
and
dickie
had
no
idea
that
it
was
wrong
it
seemed
to
him
a
wholly
delightful
and
sporting
amusement
while
he
was
exploring
the
among
the
thick
stems
of
the
grass
beale
lay
at
full
length
and
pondered
i
do
like
it
he
said
to
himself
ho
yuss
i
know
that
wot
i
got
him
for
all
right
but
such
a
jolly
little
nipper
i
would
like
anything
to
to
so
i
would
dickie
took
his
boots
off
and
went
to
sleep
as
usual
and
in
the
middle
of
the
night
beale
woke
him
up
and
said
it
time
there
was
no
moon
that
night
and
it
was
very
very
dark
beale
carried
dickie
on
his
back
for
what
seemed
a
very
long
way
along
dark
roads
under
dark
trees
and
over
dark
meadows
a
dark
bush
divided
itself
into
two
parts
and
one
part
came
surprisingly
towards
them
it
turned
out
to
be
the
man
and
presently
from
a
ditch
another
man
came
and
they
all
climbed
a
chill
damp
and
crept
along
among
trees
and
shrubs
along
the
inside
of
a
high
park
wall
dickie
still
on
beale
shoulders
was
astonished
to
find
how
quietly
this
big
man
could
move
through
openings
in
the
trees
and
bushes
dickie
could
see
the
wide
park
like
a
spread
shadow
dotted
with
trees
that
were
like
shadows
too
and
on
the
other
side
of
it
the
white
face
of
a
great
house
showed
only
a
little
paler
than
the
trees
about
it
there
were
no
lights
in
the
house
they
got
quite
close
to
it
before
the
shelter
of
the
trees
ended
for
a
little
wood
lay
between
the
wall
and
the
house
dickie
heart
was
beating
very
fast
quite
soon
now
his
part
in
the
adventure
would
begin
catch
beale
was
saying
and
the
man
took
dickie
in
his
arms
and
went
forward
the
other
two
crouched
in
the
wood
dickie
felt
himself
lifted
and
caught
at
the
with
his
hands
it
was
a
damp
night
and
smelled
of
earth
and
dead
leaves
the
was
of
stone
very
cold
dickie
knew
exactly
what
to
do
beale
had
explained
it
over
and
over
again
all
day
he
settled
himself
on
the
broad
and
held
on
to
the
iron
while
the
man
took
out
a
pane
of
glass
with
treacle
and
a
handkerchief
so
that
there
should
be
no
noise
of
breaking
or
falling
glass
then
dickie
put
his
hand
through
and
unfastened
the
window
which
opened
like
a
cupboard
door
then
he
put
his
feet
through
the
narrow
space
between
two
bars
and
slid
through
he
hung
inside
with
his
hands
holding
the
bars
till
his
foot
found
the
table
that
he
had
been
told
to
expect
just
below
and
he
got
from
that
to
the
floor
now
i
must
remember
exactly
which
way
to
go
he
told
himself
but
he
did
not
need
to
remember
what
he
had
been
told
for
quite
certainly
and
most
oddly
he
exactly
where
the
door
was
and
when
he
had
crept
to
it
and
got
it
open
he
found
that
he
now
knew
quite
well
which
way
to
turn
and
what
passages
to
go
along
to
get
to
that
little
that
he
was
to
open
for
the
three
men
it
was
exactly
as
though
he
had
been
there
before
in
a
dream
he
went
as
quietly
as
a
mouse
creeping
on
hands
and
knee
the
lame
foot
dragging
quietly
behind
him
i
will
not
pretend
that
he
was
not
frightened
he
was
very
but
he
was
more
brave
than
he
was
frightened
which
is
the
essence
of
bravery
after
all
he
found
it
difficult
to
breathe
quietly
and
his
heart
beat
so
loudly
that
he
felt
almost
sure
that
if
any
people
were
awake
in
the
house
they
would
hear
it
even
in
their
beds
but
he
got
to
the
little
and
feeling
with
sensitive
quick
fingers
found
the
bolt
and
shot
it
back
then
the
chain
holding
the
loose
loop
of
it
in
his
hand
so
that
it
should
not
rattle
he
slipped
its
ball
from
the
socket
only
the
turning
of
the
key
remained
and
dickie
accomplished
that
with
both
hands
for
it
was
a
big
key
kneeling
on
his
one
sound
knee
then
very
gently
he
turned
the
handle
and
pulled
and
the
door
opened
and
he
crept
from
behind
it
and
felt
the
cool
sweet
air
of
the
night
on
his
face
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
had
never
known
what
silence
was
before
or
darkness
for
the
door
opened
into
a
close
box
arbor
and
no
sky
could
be
seen
or
any
shapes
of
things
dickie
felt
himself
almost
bursting
with
pride
what
an
adventure
and
he
had
carried
out
his
part
of
it
perfectly
he
had
done
exactly
what
he
had
been
told
to
do
and
he
had
done
it
well
he
stood
there
on
his
one
useful
foot
clinging
to
the
edge
of
the
door
and
it
was
not
until
something
touched
him
that
he
knew
that
beale
and
the
other
men
were
creeping
through
the
door
that
he
had
opened
and
at
that
touch
a
most
odd
feeling
came
to
dickie
the
last
feeling
he
would
have
expected
a
feeling
of
pride
mixed
with
a
feeling
of
shame
pride
in
his
own
cleverness
and
another
kind
of
pride
that
made
that
cleverness
seem
shameful
he
had
a
feeling
very
queer
and
very
strong
that
he
dickie
was
not
the
sort
of
person
to
open
doors
for
the
letting
in
of
burglars
he
felt
as
you
would
feel
if
you
suddenly
found
your
hands
covered
with
filth
not
good
honest
dirt
but
slimy
filth
and
would
not
understand
how
you
could
have
let
it
get
there
he
caught
at
the
third
shape
that
brushed
by
him
father
he
whispered
do
do
it
go
back
and
i
fasten
it
all
up
again
oh
do
father
shut
your
mug
whispered
the
man
dickie
knew
his
voice
even
in
that
darkness
shut
your
mug
or
i
give
you
what
for
do
father
said
dickie
and
said
it
all
the
more
for
that
threat
i
ca
go
back
on
my
pals
matey
said
beale
you
see
that
do
yer
dickie
did
see
the
adventure
was
begun
it
was
impossible
to
stop
it
was
helped
and
had
to
be
eaten
as
they
say
in
norfolk
he
crouched
behind
the
open
door
and
heard
the
soft
of
the
three
men
feet
on
the
stones
of
the
passage
grow
fainter
and
fainter
they
had
woolen
socks
over
their
boots
which
made
their
footsteps
sound
no
louder
than
those
of
padded
then
the
soft
died
away
and
it
was
perfectly
quiet
perfectly
dark
dickie
was
tired
it
was
long
past
his
proper
bedtime
and
the
exertion
of
being
so
extra
clever
had
been
very
tiring
he
was
almost
asleep
when
a
crack
like
thunder
brought
him
stark
staring
awake
there
was
a
noise
of
feet
on
the
stairs
boots
a
blundering
hurried
rush
people
came
rushing
past
him
there
was
another
sharp
thunder
sound
and
a
flash
like
lightning
only
much
smaller
some
one
tripped
and
fell
there
was
a
clatter
like
pails
and
something
hard
and
smooth
hit
him
on
the
knee
then
another
hurried
presence
dashed
past
him
into
the
quiet
night
another
no
there
was
a
woman
voice
edward
you
sha
let
them
go
you
sha
no
and
suddenly
there
was
a
light
that
made
one
wink
and
blink
a
tall
lady
in
white
carrying
a
lamp
swept
down
the
stairs
and
caught
at
a
man
who
sprang
into
being
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
lamplight
take
the
lamp
she
said
and
thrust
it
on
him
then
with
unbelievable
quickness
she
bolted
and
chained
the
door
locked
it
and
turning
saw
dickie
what
this
she
said
oh
edward
quick
here
one
of
them
why
it
a
child
some
more
people
were
coming
down
the
stairs
with
candles
and
excited
voices
their
clothes
were
oddly
bright
dickie
had
never
seen
before
they
moved
in
a
very
odd
way
and
then
began
to
go
round
and
round
like
tops
the
next
thing
that
dickie
remembers
is
being
in
a
room
that
seemed
full
of
people
and
lights
and
wonderful
furniture
with
some
one
holding
a
glass
to
his
lips
a
little
glass
that
smelled
of
very
nasty
no
said
dickie
turning
away
his
head
better
asked
a
lady
and
dickie
was
astonished
to
find
that
he
was
on
her
lap
yes
thank
you
he
said
and
tried
to
sit
up
but
lay
back
again
because
that
was
so
much
more
pleasant
he
had
had
no
idea
that
any
one
lap
could
be
so
comfortable
now
young
man
said
a
stern
voice
that
was
not
a
lady
just
you
tell
us
how
you
came
here
and
who
put
you
up
to
it
i
got
in
said
dickie
feebly
through
the
butler
pantry
window
and
as
he
said
it
he
wondered
how
he
had
known
that
it
was
the
pantry
it
is
certain
that
no
one
had
told
him
what
for
asked
the
voice
which
dickie
now
perceived
came
from
a
gentleman
in
rumpled
hair
and
a
very
loose
pink
flannel
suit
with
cordy
things
on
it
such
as
soldiers
have
to
let
dickie
stopped
this
was
the
moment
he
had
been
so
carefully
prepared
for
he
must
think
what
he
was
saying
yes
said
the
lady
gently
it
all
right
poor
little
chap
do
be
frightened
nobody
wants
to
hurt
you
i
not
frightened
said
dickie
not
now
to
let
reminded
the
lady
persuasively
to
let
the
man
in
what
man
i
dunno
there
were
three
or
four
of
them
said
the
gentleman
in
pink
four
or
five
what
man
dear
the
lady
asked
again
the
man
as
said
knew
my
farver
was
said
dickie
remembering
what
he
had
been
told
to
say
so
i
went
along
of
an
then
in
the
wood
said
give
me
a
dressing
down
if
i
did
get
through
the
winder
and
open
the
door
said
left
some
tools
and
you
would
let
them
you
see
said
the
lady
the
child
did
know
he
perfectly
innocent
and
she
kissed
dickie
hair
very
softly
and
kindly
dickie
did
not
understand
then
why
he
suddenly
felt
as
though
he
were
going
to
choke
his
head
felt
as
though
it
were
going
to
burst
his
ears
grew
very
hot
and
his
hands
and
feet
very
cold
i
know
right
enough
he
said
suddenly
and
hoarsely
an
i
if
i
wanted
to
he
feverish
said
the
lady
he
does
know
what
he
saying
look
how
flushed
he
is
i
wanted
to
said
dickie
i
thought
it
be
a
lark
and
it
was
too
he
expected
to
be
shaken
and
put
down
he
wondered
where
his
crutch
was
beale
had
had
it
under
his
arm
how
could
he
get
to
gravesend
without
a
crutch
but
he
was
shaken
or
put
down
instead
the
lady
gathered
him
up
in
her
arms
and
stood
up
holding
him
i
shall
put
him
to
bed
she
said
you
sha
ask
him
any
more
questions
there
time
enough
in
the
morning
she
carried
dickie
out
of
the
and
away
from
the
other
people
to
a
big
room
with
blue
walls
and
blue
and
gray
curtains
and
beautiful
furniture
there
was
a
high
bed
with
blue
silk
curtains
and
more
pillows
than
dickie
had
ever
seen
before
the
lady
washed
him
with
water
in
a
big
basin
with
blue
and
gold
flowers
on
it
dressed
him
in
a
nightgown
which
must
have
been
her
own
for
it
was
much
too
big
for
any
little
boy
then
she
put
him
into
the
soft
warm
bed
that
was
like
a
giant
pillow
tucked
him
up
and
kissed
him
dickie
put
thin
arms
round
her
neck
i
do
like
you
he
said
but
i
want
farver
where
is
he
no
you
must
tell
me
that
in
the
morning
drink
up
this
milk
she
had
it
ready
in
a
glass
that
sparkled
in
a
pattern
and
then
go
sound
asleep
everything
will
be
all
right
dear
may
heavens
said
dickie
sleepily
bless
you
generous
bean
factress
a
most
extraordinary
child
said
the
lady
returning
to
her
husband
i
ca
think
who
it
is
that
he
reminds
me
of
where
are
the
others
i
packed
them
off
to
bed
there
nothing
to
be
done
said
her
husband
we
ought
to
have
gone
after
those
men
they
did
get
anything
she
said
no
dropped
it
all
when
i
fired
come
on
let
turn
in
poor
eleanor
you
must
be
worn
out
edward
said
the
lady
i
wish

adopt
that
little
boy
sure
he
comes
of
good
people
he

kidnapped
or
something

a
dear
silly
one
said
sir
edward
that
night
dickie
slept
in
sheets
of
the
finest
linen
scented
with
lavender
he
was
sunk
downily
among
pillows
and
over
him
lay
a
down
quilt
covered
with
satin
on
the
of
the
great
bed
was
carved
a
shield
and
a
great
dog
on
it
dickie
clothes
lay
a
dusty
forlorn
little
heap
in
a
stately
chair
and
he
slept
and
dreamed
of
beale
and
the
little
house
among
the
furze
and
the
bed
with
the
green
curtains
chapter
iii
the
escape
when
lady
talbot
leaned
over
the
side
of
the
big
bed
to
awaken
dickie
harding
she
wished
with
all
her
heart
that
she
had
just
such
a
little
boy
of
her
own
and
when
dickie
awoke
and
looked
in
her
kind
eyes
he
felt
quite
sure
that
if
he
had
had
a
mother
she
would
have
been
like
this
lady
only
about
the
face
he
told
himself
not
the
way
she
got
up
nor
yet
her
hair
nor
nuffink
of
that
sort
did
you
sleep
well
she
asked
him
stroking
his
hair
with
extraordinary
gentleness
a
fair
treat
said
he
was
your
bed
comfortable
ai
it
soft
neither
he
answered
i
do
know
as
ever
i
felt
of
anythink
quite
as
soft
without
it
was
the
geese
as
up
along
the
broadway
why
the
bed
made
of
she
said
and
dickie
was
delighted
by
the
coincidence
you
got
a
little
boy
he
asked
pursuing
his
first
waking
thought
no
dear
if
i
had
i
could
lend
you
some
of
his
clothes
as
it
is
we
shall
have
to
put
you
into
your
own
she
spoke
as
though
she
were
sorry
dickie
saw
no
matter
for
regret
my
father
bought
me
a
little
coat
for
when
it
was
cold
of
a
night
lying
out
lying
out
where
in
the
bed
with
the
green
curtains
said
dickie
this
led
to
here
ward
and
dickie
would
willingly
have
told
the
whole
story
of
that
hero
in
full
detail
but
the
lady
said
after
breakfast
and
now
it
was
time
for
our
bath
and
sure
enough
there
was
a
bath
of
steaming
water
before
the
fireplace
which
was
in
quite
another
part
of
the
room
so
that
dickie
had
not
noticed
the
cans
being
brought
in
by
a
maid
in
a
pink
print
dress
and
white
cap
and
apron
come
said
the
lady
turning
back
the
somehow
dickie
could
not
bear
to
let
that
lady
see
him
crawl
clumsily
across
the
floor
as
he
had
to
do
when
he
moved
without
his
crutch
it
was
not
because
he
thought
she
would
make
fun
of
him
perhaps
it
was
because
he
knew
she
would
not
and
yet
without
his
crutch
how
else
was
he
to
get
to
that
bath
and
for
no
reason
that
he
could
have
given
he
began
to
cry
the
lady
arms
were
round
him
in
an
instant
what
is
it
dear
whatever
is
it
she
asked
and
dickie
sobbed
out
i
ai
got
my
crutch
and
i
ca
go
to
that
there
barf
without
i
got
it
anything
do
if
was
only
an
old
broom
cut
down
to
me
i
a
cripple
they
call
it
you
see
i
ca
walk
like
wot
you
can
she
carried
him
to
the
bath
there
was
scented
soap
there
was
a
sponge
and
a
warm
fluffy
towel
i
ai
had
a
barf
since
gravesend
said
dickie
and
flushed
at
the
indiscretion
since
dear
since
wednesday
said
dickie
anxiously
he
and
the
lady
had
breakfast
together
in
a
big
room
with
long
windows
that
the
sun
shone
in
at
and
outside
a
green
garden
there
were
a
lot
of
things
to
eat
in
silver
dishes
and
the
very
eggs
had
silver
cups
to
sit
in
and
all
the
spoons
and
forks
had
dogs
scratched
on
them
like
the
one
that
was
carved
on
the
of
the
bed
all
except
the
little
slender
spoon
that
dickie
had
to
eat
his
egg
with
and
on
that
there
was
no
dog
but
something
quite
different
why
said
he
his
face
brightening
with
joyous
recognition
my
tinkler
got
this
on
it
just
the
very
moral
of
it
so
then
he
had
to
tell
all
about
tinkler
and
the
lady
looked
thoughtful
and
interested
and
when
the
gentleman
came
in
and
kissed
her
and
said
how
were
we
this
morning
dickie
had
to
tell
about
tinkler
all
over
again
and
then
the
lady
said
several
things
very
quickly
beginning
with
i
told
you
so
edward
and
ending
with
i
knew
he
was
a
common
child
dickie
missed
the
middle
part
of
what
she
said
because
of
the
way
his
egg
behaved
suddenly
bursting
all
down
one
side
and
running
over
into
the
salt
which
of
course
had
to
be
stopped
at
all
costs
by
some
means
or
other
the
tongue
was
the
easiest
the
gentleman
laughed
weh
do
eat
the
he
said
we
shall
want
it
again
have
another
egg
but
dickie
pride
was
hurt
and
he
would
the
gentleman
must
be
very
stupid
he
thought
not
to
know
the
difference
between
licking
and
eating
and
as
if
anybody
could
eat
an
anyhow
he
was
glad
when
the
gentleman
went
away
after
breakfast
dickie
was
measured
for
a
crutch
that
is
to
say
a
broom
was
held
up
beside
him
and
a
piece
cut
off
its
handle
then
the
lady
wrapped
flannel
around
the
hairy
part
of
the
broom
and
sewed
black
velvet
over
that
it
was
a
beautiful
crutch
and
dickie
said
so
also
he
showed
his
gratitude
by
inviting
the
lady
to
look
spry
was
on
pins
but
she
only
looked
a
very
little
while
and
then
turned
and
gazed
out
of
the
window
so
dickie
had
a
good
look
at
the
room
and
the
furniture
it
was
all
different
from
anything
he
ever
remembered
seeing
and
yet
he
could
help
thinking
he
had
seen
them
before
these
chairs
covered
with
flowers
like
on
carpets
the
carved
bookcases
with
rows
on
rows
of
books
the
shining
sideboard
with
handles
that
shone
like
gold
and
the
corner
cupboard
with
glass
doors
and
china
inside
red
and
blue
and
goldy
it
was
a
very
odd
feeling
i
do
think
that
i
can
describe
it
better
than
by
saying
that
he
looked
at
all
these
things
with
a
double
pleasure
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
new
and
beautiful
things
and
the
pleasure
of
seeing
again
things
old
and
beautiful
which
he
had
not
seen
for
a
very
long
time
his
limping
survey
of
the
room
ended
at
the
windows
when
the
lady
turned
suddenly
knelt
down
put
her
hand
under
his
chin
and
looked
into
his
eyes
dickie
she
said
how
would
you
like
to
stay
here
and
be
little
boy
i
like
it
right
enough
said
he
only
i
got
to
go
back
to
father
but
if
father
says
you
may
wo
said
dickie
with
certainty
an
besides
there
tinkler
well
you
to
stay
here
and
be
my
little
boy
till
we
find
out
where
father
is
we
shall
let
the
police
know
they
sure
to
find
him
the
pleece
dickie
cried
in
horror
why
father
ai
done
nothing
no
no
of
course
not
said
the
lady
in
a
hurry
but
the
police
know
all
sorts
of
things
about
where
people
are
i
know
and
what
doing
even
when
they
have
anything
the
pleece
knows
a
jolly
sight
too
much
said
dickie
in
gloom
and
now
all
dickie
little
soul
was
filled
with
one
longing
all
his
little
brain
awake
to
one
only
thought
the
police
were
to
be
set
on
the
track
of
beale
the
man
whom
he
called
father
the
man
who
had
been
kind
to
him
had
wheeled
him
in
a
perambulator
for
miles
and
miles
through
enchanted
country
the
man
who
had
bought
him
a
little
coat
to
put
on
o
nights
if
it
was
cold
or
wet
the
man
who
had
shown
him
the
wonderful
world
to
which
he
awakens
who
has
slept
in
the
bed
with
the
green
curtains
the
lady
house
was
more
beautiful
than
anything
he
had
ever
imagined
yet
not
more
beautiful
than
certain
things
that
he
almost
imagined
that
he
remembered
the
lady
was
better
than
beautiful
she
was
dear
her
eyes
were
the
eyes
to
which
it
is
good
to
laugh
her
arms
were
the
arms
in
which
it
is
good
to
cry
the
parkland
was
to
dickie
the
land
of
heart
desire
but
father
beale
who
had
been
kind
whom
dickie
loved
the
lady
left
him
alone
with
a
book
beautiful
beyond
his
dreams
three
great
volumes
with
pictures
of
things
that
had
happened
and
been
since
the
days
of
hereward
himself
the
author
charming
name
was
green
and
recalled
curtains
and
nights
under
the
stars
but
even
those
beautiful
pictures
could
not
keep
dickie
thoughts
from
beale
father
by
adoption
and
love
if
the
police
were
set
to
find
out
where
he
was
and
what
he
was
doing
somehow
or
other
dickie
must
get
to
gravesend
to
that
house
where
there
had
been
a
bath
or
something
like
it
in
a
pail
and
where
kindly
had
toasted
herrings
and
given
apples
to
little
boys
who
helped
he
had
helped
then
and
by
all
the
laws
of
fair
play
there
ought
to
be
some
one
now
to
help
him
the
beautiful
book
lay
on
the
table
before
him
but
he
no
longer
saw
it
he
no
longer
cared
for
it
all
he
cared
for
was
to
find
a
friend
who
would
help
him
and
he
found
one
and
the
friend
who
helped
him
was
an
enemy
the
smart
maid
who
unseen
by
dickie
had
brought
the
and
the
bath
came
in
with
a
duster
she
looked
malevolently
at
dickie
shovin
yourself
in
she
said
rudely
i
ai
said
he
if
she
wants
to
make
a
fool
of
a
kid
ai
i
got
clever
brothers
and
sisters
inquired
the
maid
her
chin
in
the
air
nobody
says
you
ai
and
nobody
ai
makin
a
fool
of
me
said
dickie
ho
no
course
they
ai
the
maid
rejoined
people
comes
without
a
shirt
to
their
backs
and
makes
fools
of
their
betters
that
the
way
it
is
ai
it
ai
she
arst
you
to
stay
and
be
little
boy
yes
said
dickie
ah
i
thought
she
said
the
maid
triumphantly
and
you

but
if
i
expected
to
call
you
master
i
gives
a
month
warning
so
i
tell
you
straight
i
do
want
to
stay
said
dickie
at
least
oh
tell
me
another
said
the
girl
impatiently
and
left
him
without
having
made
the
slightest
use
of
the
duster
dickie
was
taken
for
a
drive
in
a
little
carriage
drawn
by
a
pony
with
a
long
tail
a
perfect
dream
of
a
pony
and
the
lady
allowed
him
to
hold
the
reins
but
even
amid
this
delight
he
remembered
to
ask
whether
she
had
put
the
police
on
to
father
yet
and
was
relieved
to
hear
that
she
had
not
it
was
markham
who
was
told
to
wash
dickie
hands
when
the
drive
was
over
and
markham
was
the
enemy
with
the
clever
brothers
and
sisters
wash
yourself
she
said
among
the
soap
and
silver
and
marble
and
sponges
it
ai
my
work
you
better
said
dickie
or
the
lady
know
the
difference
it
ai
my
work
neither
and
i
ai
so
used
to
washing
as
what
you
are
and
that
the
truth
so
she
washed
him
not
very
gently
it
no
use
your
getting
your
knife
into
me
he
said
as
the
towel
was
plied
i
did
to
come
did
i
no
you
little
thief
stow
that
said
dickie
and
after
a
quick
glance
at
his
set
lips
she
said
well
next
door
to
anyhow
i
should
be
ashamed
to
show
my
face
if
i
was
you
after
last
night
there
you
dry
now
cut
along
down
to
the
the
servants
hall
good
enough
for
honest
people
as
do
break
into
houses
all
through
that
day
of
wonder
which
included
real
roses
that
you
could
pick
and
smell
and
real
gooseberries
that
you
could
gather
and
eat
as
well
as
a
clockwork
bear
a
musical
box
and
a
house
almost
as
big
as
a
small
villa
an
idea
kept
on
hammering
at
the
other
side
of
a
locked
door
in
dickie
mind
and
when
he
was
in
bed
it
got
the
door
open
and
came
out
and
looked
at
him
and
he
recognized
it
at
once
as
a
really
useful
idea
markham
will
bring
you
some
warm
milk
drink
it
up
and
sleep
well
darling
said
the
lady
and
with
the
idea
very
near
and
plain
he
put
his
arms
round
her
neck
and
hugged
her
he
said
you
good
i
do
love
you
the
lady
went
away
very
pleased
when
markham
came
with
the
milk
dickie
said
you
want
me
gone
you
markham
said
she
did
care
well
but
how
am
i
to
get
away
with
my
crutch
mean
to
say
you
cut
and
run
if
you
was
the
same
as
me
about
the
legs
i
mean
yes
said
dickie
and
not
nick
anything
not
a
bloomin
thing
said
he
well
said
markham
you
got
a
spirit
i
will
say
that
you
see
said
dickie
i
wants
to
get
back
to
farver
bless
the
child
said
markham
quite
affected
by
this
why
do
you
help
me
get
out
once
i
was
outside
the
park
i
do
all
right
much
as
my
place
is
worth
said
markham
do
you
say
another
word
getting
me
into
trouble
but
dickie
said
a
good
many
other
words
and
fell
asleep
quite
satisfied
with
the
last
words
that
had
fallen
from
markham
these
words
were
we
see
it
was
only
just
daylight
when
markham
woke
him
she
dressed
him
hurriedly
and
carried
him
and
his
crutch
down
the
back
stairs
and
into
that
very
butler
pantry
through
whose
window
he
had
crept
at
the
bidding
of
the
man
no
one
else
seemed
to
be
about
now
she
said
the
gardener
he
has
got
a
few
hampers
ready
fruit
and
flowers
and
the
like
and
he
drives
to
the
station
any
up
they
only
go
to
waste
if
was
to
sell
see
an
he
a
particular
friend
of
mine
and
he
wo
mind
an
extry
hamper
more
or
less
so
out
with
you
joe
she
whispered
you
there
joe
outside
whispered
that
he
was
and
markham
lifted
dickie
to
the
window
as
she
did
so
she
kissed
him
old
chap
she
said
i
sorry
i
was
so
short
an
you
do
want
to
get
out
of
it
do
you
no
error
said
dickie
an
i
never
split
about
him
selling
the
vegetables
and
things
you
too
sharp
to
live
markham
declared
and
next
moment
he
was
through
the
window
and
joe
was
laying
him
in
a
long
hamper
with
straw
that
stood
waiting
i
put
you
in
the
van
along
with
the
other
hampers
whispered
joe
as
he
shut
the
lid
then
when
you
in
the
train
you
just
cut
the
string
with
this
little
knife
i
make
you
a
present
of
and
out
you
gets
i
make
it
all
right
with
the
guard
he
knows
me
and
he
put
you
down
at
whatever
station
you
say
here
do
forget
breakfast
said
markham
reaching
her
arm
through
the
window
it
was
a
wonderful
breakfast
five
cold
rissoles
a
lot
of
bread
and
butter
two
slices
of
cake
and
a
bottle
of
milk
and
it
was
fun
eating
agreeable
and
unusual
things
lying
down
in
the
roomy
hamper
among
the
smooth
straw
the
jolting
of
the
cart
did
not
worry
dickie
at
all
he
was
used
to
the
perambulator
and
he
ate
as
much
as
he
wanted
to
eat
and
when
that
was
done
he
put
the
rest
in
his
pocket
and
curled
up
comfortably
in
the
straw
for
there
was
still
quite
a
lot
left
of
what
ordinary
people
consider
night
and
also
there
was
quite
a
lot
left
of
the
sleepiness
with
which
he
had
gone
to
bed
at
the
end
of
the
wonderful
day
it
was
not
only
just
the
kind
you
get
after
a
long
walk
or
a
long
play
day
it
was
dickie
had
gone
through
so
much
in
the
last
hours
that
his
poor
little
brain
felt
quite
worn
out
he
fell
asleep
among
the
straw
fingering
the
in
his
pocket
and
thinking
how
smartly
he
would
cut
the
string
when
the
time
came
illustration
three
or
four
faces
looked
down
at
dickie
and
he
slept
for
a
very
long
time
such
a
long
time
that
when
he
did
wake
up
there
was
no
longer
any
need
to
cut
the
string
of
the
hamper
some
one
else
had
done
that
and
the
lid
of
the
basket
was
open
and
three
or
four
faces
looked
down
at
dickie
and
a
girl
voice
said
why
it
a
little
boy
and
a
crutch
oh
dear
dickie
sat
up
the
little
crutch
which
was
lying
above
him
in
the
hamper
jerked
out
and
rattled
on
the
floor
well
i
never
did
never
said
another
voice
come
out
dearie
be
frightened
how
kind
people
are
dickie
thought
and
reached
his
hands
to
slender
white
hands
that
were
held
out
to
him
a
lady
in
black
her
figure
was
as
slender
as
her
hands
drew
him
up
put
her
arms
round
him
and
lifted
him
on
to
a
black
bentwood
chair
his
eyes
turning
swiftly
here
and
there
showed
him
that
he
was
in
a
shop
a
shop
full
of
flowers
and
fruit
rosenberg
said
the
slender
lady
oh
do
come
here
please
this
extra
hamper
a
dark
handsome
man
came
towards
them
it
a
dear
little
boy
said
the
slender
lady
who
had
a
pale
kind
face
dark
eyes
and
very
red
lips
a
practical
joke
i
shuppothe
said
the
dark
man
our
gardening
friend
wanth
a
liththon
and
i
thee
he
getth
it
it
was
his
fault
said
dickie
wriggling
earnestly
in
his
high
chair
it
was
my
fault
i
fell
asleep
the
girls
crowded
round
him
with
questions
and
caresses
i
ought
to
have
cut
the
string
in
the
train
and
told
the
guard
he
a
friend
of
the
gardener
he
said
but
i
was
asleep
i
do
know
as
ever
i
slep
so
sound
afore
like
as
if
i
had
you
know
like
they
give
me
at
the
orspittle
i
should
not
like
to
think
that
markham
had
gone
so
far
as
to
put
in
that
bottle
of
milk
but
i
am
afraid
she
was
not
very
particular
and
she
may
have
thought
it
best
to
send
dickie
to
sleep
so
that
he
could
not
betray
her
or
her
gardener
friend
until
he
was
very
far
away
from
both
of
them
but
why
asked
the
gentleman
why
put
boyth
in
bathketth
upthetting
everybody
like
thith
he
added
crossly
it
was
said
dickie
slowly
a
sort
of
joke
i
do
want
to
go
upsetting
of
people
if
you
lift
me
down
and
give
me
me
crutch
it
but
the
young
ladies
would
not
hear
of
his
hooking
it
we
may
keep
him
may
we
mr
rosenberg
they
said
and
he
judged
that
rosenberg
was
a
kind
man
or
they
would
not
have
dared
to
speak
so
to
him
let
keep
him
till
and
then
one
of
us
will
see
him
home
he
lives
in
london
he
says
so
dickie
had
indeed
murmured
words
to
this
effect
as
policemen
call
it
when
they
are
not
quite
sure
what
people
really
said
ath
you
like
said
rosenberg
only
you
muth
let
him
interfere
with
bithneth
thath
all
they
took
him
away
to
the
back
of
the
shop
they
were
dear
girls
and
they
were
very
nice
to
dickie
they
gave
him
grapes
and
a
banana
and
some
marie
biscuits
and
they
folded
sacks
for
him
to
lie
on
and
dickie
liked
them
and
was
grateful
to
them
and
watched
his
opportunity
because
however
kind
people
were
there
was
one
thing
he
had
to
do
to
get
back
to
the
gravesend
as
his
father
had
told
him
to
do
the
opportunity
did
not
come
till
late
in
the
afternoon
when
one
of
the
girls
was
boiling
a
kettle
on
a
and
one
had
gone
out
to
get
cakes
in
dickie
honor
which
made
him
uncomfortable
but
duty
is
duty
and
over
the
gravesend
the
star
of
duty
shone
and
beckoned
the
third
young
lady
and
rosenberg
were
engaged
in
animated
explanations
with
a
fair
young
gentleman
about
a
basket
of
roses
that
had
been
ordered
and
had
not
been
sent
cath
rosenberg
was
saying
cath
down
enthureth
thpeedy
delivery
and
the
young
lady
was
saying
i
am
extremely
sorry
sir
it
was
a
misunderstanding
and
to
the
music
of
their
two
voices
dickie
edged
along
close
to
the
grapes
and
melons
holding
on
to
the
shelf
on
which
they
lay
so
as
not
to
attract
attention
by
the
of
his
crutch
he
passed
silently
and
slowly
between
the
window
and
the
heap
of
bananas
that
adorned
the
other
side
of
the
doorway
turned
the
corner
threw
his
arm
over
his
crutch
and
legged
away
for
dear
life
down
a
sort
of
covered
arcade
turned
its
corner
and
found
himself
in
a
wilderness
of
baskets
and
carts
and
vegetables
threaded
his
way
through
them
in
and
out
among
the
baskets
over
fallen
under
horses
noses
found
a
quiet
street
a
still
quieter
archway
pulled
out
the
knife
however
his
adventure
ended
he
was
that
knife
to
the
good
and
prepared
to
cut
the
money
out
of
the
belt
beale
had
buckled
round
him
and
the
belt
was
not
there
had
he
dropped
it
somewhere
or
had
he
and
markham
in
the
hurry
of
that
twilight
dressing
forgotten
to
put
it
on
he
did
not
know
all
he
knew
was
that
the
belt
was
not
on
him
and
that
he
was
alone
in
london
without
money
and
that
at
gravesend
his
father
was
waiting
for
him
waiting
waiting
dickie
knew
what
it
meant
to
wait
he
went
out
into
the
street
and
asked
the
first
loafer
he
saw
the
way
to
gravesend
way
to
your
grandmother
said
the
loafer
do
you
come
saucing
of
me
but
which
is
the
way
said
dickie
the
man
looked
hard
at
him
and
then
pointed
with
a
grimy
thumb
over
his
shoulder
it
thirty
mile
if
it
a
yard
he
said
got
any
chink
i
lost

dickie

the
man

i
ai

dickie

the

and
pulled
his
hand
out
of
his
pocket

said
dickie
then

left
and
you

a
blue
as

the
that
a
bit
of
the
way
then
you
arst
again
and
this
pay
for
the
he
held
out
coppers
this
practical
kindness
went
to
dickie
heart
more
than
all
the
kisses
of
the
young
ladies
in
the
the
tears
came
into
his
eyes
well
you
a
pal
and
no
error
he
said
do
the
same
for
you
some
day
he
added
the
lounging
man
laughed
i

to
that
matey
he
said
when

in
yer
carriage
an
pair
you
take
me
on
ter
be
yer
footman
when
i
am
i
will
said
dickie
quite
seriously
and
then
they
both
laughed
the
elephant
and
castle
marks
but
a
very
short
stage
of
the
weary
way
between
london
and
gravesend
when
he
got
out
of
the
tram
dickie
asked
the
way
again
this
time
of
a
woman
who
was
selling
matches
in
the
gutter
she
pointed
with
the
blue
box
she
held
in
her
hand
it
a
long
way
she
said
in
a
tired
voice
nigh
on
thirty
mile
thank
you
missis
said
dickie
and
set
out
quite
simply
to
walk
those
miles
nearly
thirty
the
way
lay
down
the
old
kent
road
and
presently
dickie
was
in
familiar
surroundings
for
the
old
kent
road
leads
into
the
new
cross
road
and
that
runs
right
through
the
yellow
brick
wilderness
where
dickie
aunt
lived
he
dared
not
follow
the
road
through
those
scenes
at
any
moment
he
might
meet
his
aunt
and
if
he
met
his
aunt
he
preferred
not
to
think
of
it
outside
the
marquis
of
granby
stood
a
van
and
the
horses
heads
were
turned
away
from
london
if
one
could
get
a
lift
dickie
looked
anxiously
to
right
and
left
in
front
and
behind
there
were
wooden
boxes
in
the
van
a
lot
of
them
and
on
the
canvas
of
the
tilt
was
painted
in
fat
white
letters
fry
tonic
the
only
cure
there
would
be
room
on
the
top
of
the
boxes
they
did
not
reach
within
two
feet
of
the
tilt
should
he
ask
for
a
lift
when
the
carter
came
out
of
the
marquis
or
should
he
if
he
could
climb
up
and
hide
on
the
boxes
and
take
his
chance
of
discovery
on
the
lift
he
laid
a
hand
on
the
hi
dickie
said
a
voice
surprisingly
in
his
ear
that
you
dickie
owned
that
it
was
with
the
feeling
of
a
trapped
wild
animal
and
turned
and
faced
a
boy
of
his
own
age
a
schoolfellow
the
one
in
fact
who
had
christened
him
oh
what
a
turn
you
give
me
he
said
thought
you
was
my
aunt
you
let
on
you
seen
me
where
you
been
asked
the
boy
curiously
oh
all
about
dickie
answered
vaguely
do
you
tell
me
aunt
yer
aunt
do
you
know
the
boy
was
quite
contemptuous
with
him
for
not
knowing
know
no
know
what
she
shot
the
moon
old
hurle
moved
her
says
he
do
remember
where
to
she
give
him
a
pint
to
forget
what
i
say
who
livin
there
now
dickie
asked
interest
in
his
aunt
address
swallowed
up
in
a
sudden
desperate
anxiety
no
one
do
live
there
it
shut
up
to
let
apply
roberts
broadway
said
the
boy
i
say
what
you
do
i
do
know
said
dickie
turning
away
from
the
van
which
had
abruptly
become
unimportant
which
way
you
goin
down
home
go
past
your
old
shop
coming
no
said
dickie
so
long
see
you
again
some
day
i
got
to
go
this
way
and
he
went
it
all
the
same
the
twilight
saw
him
creeping
down
the
old
road
to
the
house
whose
had
held
the
the
garden
where
he
had
sowed
the
parrot
food
and
where
the
moonflowers
had
come
up
so
white
and
beautiful
what
a
long
time
ago
it
was
only
a
month
really
but
all
the
same
what
a
long
time
the
news
of
his
aunt
departure
had
changed
everything
the
steadfast
desire
to
get
to
gravesend
to
find
his
father
had
given
way
at
any
rate
for
the
moment
to
a
burning
anxiety
about
tinkler
and
the
white
stone
had
his
aunt
found
them
and
taken
them
away
if
she
had
and
they
were
still
there
would
it
not
be
wise
to
get
them
at
once
because
of
course
some
one
else
might
take
the
house
and
find
the
treasures
yes
it
would
certainly
be
wise
to
go
to
get
in
by
the
front
window
the
catch
had
always
been
broken
to
find
his
treasures
or
at
any
rate
to
make
quite
sure
whether
he
had
lost
them
or
not
no
one
noticed
him
as
he
came
down
the
street
very
close
to
the
railings
there
are
so
many
boys
in
the
streets
in
that
part
of
the
world
and
the
front
window
went
up
easily
he
climbed
in
dragging
his
crutch
after
him
he
got
very
quickly
on
hands
and
knees
went
straight
to
the
loose
board
dislodged
it
felt
in
the
hollow
below
oh
joy
his
hands
found
the
soft
bundle
of
rags
that
he
knew
held
tinkler
and
the
seal
he
put
them
inside
the
front
of
his
shirt
and
shuffled
down
it
was
not
too
late
to
do
a
mile
or
two
of
the
gravesend
road
but
the
moonflower
he
would
like
to
have
one
more
look
at
that
he
got
out
into
the
garden
there
stood
the
stalk
of
the
flower
very
tall
in
the
deepening
dusk
he
touched
the
stalk
it
was
dry
and
hard
three
or
four
little
dry
things
fell
from
above
and
rattled
on
his
head
seeds
o
course
said
dickie
who
knew
more
about
seeds
now
than
he
had
done
when
he
saved
the
parrot
seeds
one
does
not
tramp
the
country
for
a
month
at
dickie
age
without
learning
something
about
seeds
he
got
out
the
knife
that
should
have
cut
the
string
of
the
basket
in
the
train
opened
it
and
cut
the
stalk
of
the
moonflower
very
carefully
so
that
none
of
the
seeds
should
be
and
only
a
few
were
lost
he
crept
into
the
house
holding
the
stalk
upright
and
steady
as
an
acolyte
carries
a
processional
cross
illustration
he
made
with
triple
lines
of
silvery
seeds
a
star
the
house
was
quite
dark
now
but
a
street
lamp
threw
its
light
into
the
front
room
bare
empty
and
dusty
there
was
a
torn
newspaper
on
the
floor
he
spread
a
sheet
of
it
out
kneeled
by
it
and
shook
the
moonflower
head
over
it
the
seeds
came
rattling
out
dozens
and
dozens
of
them
they
were
bigger
than
sunflower
seeds
and
flatter
and
rounder
and
they
shone
like
silver
or
like
the
pods
of
the
plant
we
call
honesty
oh
beautiful
beautiful
said
dickie
letting
the
smooth
shapes
slide
through
his
fingers
have
you
ever
played
with
card
counters
the
seeds
of
the
moonflower
were
like
those
he
pulled
out
tinkler
and
the
seal
and
laid
them
on
the
heap
of
seeds
and
then
knew
quite
suddenly
that
he
was
too
tired
to
travel
any
further
that
night
i
doss
here
he
said
there
plenty
papers
he
knew
by
experience
that
as
newspapers
are
warm
if
noisy
and
get
on
in
the
morning
afore
people
up
he
collected
all
the
paper
and
straw
there
was
a
good
deal
littered
about
in
the
house
and
made
a
heap
in
the
corner
out
of
the
way
of
the
window
he
did
not
feel
afraid
of
sleeping
in
an
empty
house
only
very
lordly
and
magnificent
because
he
had
a
whole
house
to
himself
the
food
still
left
in
his
pockets
served
for
supper
and
you
could
drink
quite
well
at
the
tap
by
putting
your
head
under
and
turning
it
on
very
slowly
and
for
a
final
enjoyment
he
laid
out
his
treasures
on
the
newspaper
tinkler
and
the
seal
in
the
middle
and
the
pearly
counters
arranged
in
patterns
round
them
circles
and
squares
and
oblongs
the
seeds
lay
very
flat
and
fitted
close
together
they
were
excellent
for
making
patterns
with
and
presently
he
made
with
triple
lines
of
silvery
seeds
a
star
something
like
this
illustration
v
with
the
rattle
and
the
seal
in
the
middle
and
the
light
from
the
street
lamp
shone
brightly
on
it
all
that
the
prettiest
of
the
lot
said
dickie
harding
alone
in
the
empty
house
and
then
the
magic
began
chapter
iv
which
was
the
dream
the
two
crossed
triangles
of
white
seeds
in
the
midst
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
lay
on
the
floor
of
the
little
empty
house
grew
dim
and
faint
before
dickie
eyes
and
his
eyes
suddenly
smarted
and
felt
tired
so
that
he
was
very
glad
to
shut
them
he
had
an
absurd
fancy
that
he
could
see
through
his
closed
eyelids
something
moving
in
the
middle
of
the
star
that
the
two
triangles
made
but
he
knew
that
this
must
be
nonsense
because
of
course
you
can
not
see
through
your
eyelids
his
eyelids
felt
so
heavy
that
he
could
not
take
the
trouble
to
lift
them
even
when
a
voice
spoke
quite
near
him
he
had
no
doubt
but
that
it
was
the
policeman
come
to
take
him
up
for
being
in
a
house
that
was
not
his
let
him
said
dickie
to
himself
he
was
too
sleepy
to
be
afraid
but
for
a
policeman
who
is
usually
of
quite
a
large
pattern
the
voice
was
unusually
soft
and
small
it
said
briskly
now
then
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
i
ai
particular
said
dickie
who
supposed
himself
to
be
listening
to
an
offer
of
a
choice
of
there
were
whispers
two
small
and
soft
voices
they
made
a
sleepy
music
he
more
yours
than
mine
said
one
you
more
his
than
i
am
said
the
other
you
older
than
i
am
said
the
first
you
stronger
than
i
am
said
the
second
let
spin
for
it
said
the
first
voice
and
there
was
a
humming
sound
ending
in
a
little
tinkling
fall
that
settles
it
said
the
second
voice
here
and
when
three
a
good
number
then
everything
was
very
quiet
and
sleep
wrapped
dickie
like
a
soft
cloak
when
he
awoke
his
eyelids
no
longer
felt
heavy
so
he
opened
them
that
was
a
rum
dream
he
told
himself
as
he
blinked
in
broad
daylight
he
lay
in
bed
a
big
strange
bed
in
a
room
that
he
had
never
seen
before
the
windows
were
low
and
long
with
small
panes
and
the
light
was
broken
by
upright
stone
divisions
the
floor
was
of
dark
wood
strewn
strangely
with
flowers
and
green
herbs
and
the
bed
was
a
bed
like
the
one
he
had
slept
in
at
talbot
house
and
in
the
green
curtains
was
woven
a
white
pattern
very
like
the
thing
that
was
engraved
on
tinkler
and
on
the
white
seal
on
the
coverlet
lavender
and
other
herbs
were
laid
and
the
wall
was
hung
with
pictures
done
in
needlework
tapestry
in
fact
though
dickie
did
not
know
that
this
was
its
name
all
the
furniture
was
heavily
built
of
wood
heavily
carved
an
enormous
dark
cupboard
or
wardrobe
loomed
against
one
wall
chairs
with
tapestry
seats
were
ranged
in
a
row
against
another
the
third
wall
was
almost
all
window
and
in
the
fourth
wall
the
fireplace
was
set
with
a
chimney
and
wide
open
hearth
near
the
bed
stood
a
stool
or
table
with
cups
and
bottles
on
it
and
on
the
necks
of
the
bottles
parchment
labels
were
tied
that
stuck
out
stiffly
a
stout
woman
in
very
full
skirts
sat
in
a
large
armchair
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
she
wore
a
queer
white
cap
the
like
of
which
dickie
had
never
seen
and
round
her
neck
was
a
ruff
which
reminded
him
of
the
frills
in
the
ham
and
beef
shops
in
the
new
cross
road
what
a
curious
dream
said
dickie
the
woman
looked
at
him
so
found
thy
tongue
she
said
folk
must
look
to
have
curious
dreams
who
fall
sick
of
the
fever
but
found
thy
tongue
at
last
thine
own
tongue
not
the
wandering
tongue
that
has
wagged
so
fast
these
last
days
but
i
thought
i
was
in
the
front
room
at
dickie
began
here
said
she
the
other
is
the
dream
forget
it
and
do
not
talk
of
it
to
talk
of
such
dreams
brings
misfortune
and
is
time
for
thy
posset
she
took
a
pipkin
from
the
hearth
where
a
small
fire
burned
though
it
was
summer
weather
as
dickie
could
see
by
the
green
that
swayed
and
moved
outside
in
the
sun
poured
some
gruel
out
of
it
into
a
silver
basin
it
had
wrought
roses
on
it
and
drink
me
and
drink
again
in
queer
letters
round
the
rim
but
this
dickie
only
noticed
later
she
poured
white
wine
into
the
gruel
and
having
stirred
it
with
a
silver
spoon
fed
dickie
as
one
feeds
a
baby
blowing
on
each
spoonful
to
cool
it
the
gruel
was
very
sweet
and
pleasant
dickie
stretched
in
the
downy
bed
felt
extremely
comfortable
and
fell
asleep
again
next
time
he
awoke
it
was
with
many
questions
how
i
come
i
bin
run
over
agen
is
it
a
hospital
who
are
you
now
do
you
begin
to
wander
again
said
the
woman
in
the
cap
you
here
at
home
in
the
best
bed
in
your
father
house
at
deptford
and
you
had
the
and
you
better
or
ought
to
be
but
if
you
do
know
your
own
old
nurse

never

dickie
old
nor
new
so

other
chap
that
what
it
is
where
did

hold
of
me
i
never

repeated
the
nurse
briskly
you
lie
still
and
think
and
you
see
you
remember
me
very
well
forget
your
old
nurse
why
you
will
tell
me
next
that
you
forgotten
your
own

i
have
said
dickie
what
is
it
then
the
nurse
asked
laughing
a
fat
comfortable
laugh
dickie
reply
was
naturally
dickie
harding
why
said
the
nurse
opening
wide
eyes
at
him
under
gray
brows
you
forgotten
it
they
do
say
that
the
fever
hurts
the
memory
but
this
beats
all
dost
mean
to
tell
me
the
fever
has
mazed
thy
poor
brains
till
thou
do
know
that
thy
name
richard
and
dickie
heard
her
name
a
name
that
did
not
sound
to
him
at
all
like
harding
is
that
my
name
he
asked
it
is
indeed
she
answered
dickie
felt
an
odd
sensation
of
fixedness
he
had
expected
when
he
went
to
sleep
that
the
dream
would
in
sleep
end
and
that
he
would
wake
to
find
himself
alone
in
the
empty
house
at
new
cross
but
he
had
wakened
to
the
same
dream
once
more
and
now
he
began
to
wonder
whether
he
really
belonged
here
and
whether
this
were
the
real
life
and
the
other
the
old
sordid
dirty
new
cross
life
merely
a
horrid
dream
the
consequence
of
his
fever
he
lay
and
thought
and
looked
at
the
rich
pleasant
room
the
kind
clear
face
of
the
nurse
the
green
green
branches
of
the
trees
the
tapestry
and
the
rushes
at
last
he
spoke
nurse
said
he
ah
i
thought
you
come
to
yourself
she
said
what
is
it
my
dearie
if
i
am
really
the
name
you
said
i
forgotten
it
tell
me
all
about
myself
will
you
nurse
i
thought
as
much
she
muttered
and
then
began
to
tell
him
wonderful
things
she
told
him
how
his
father
was
sir
richard
the
king
had
made
him
a
knight
only
last
year
and
how
this
place
where
they
now
were
was
his
father
country
house
it
lies
said
the
nurse
among
the
pleasant
fields
and
orchards
of
deptford
and
how
he
dickie
had
been
very
sick
of
the
pestilential
fever
but
was
now
thanks
to
the
blessing
and
to
the
ministrations
of
good
carey
on
the
highroad
to
health
and
when
you
are
strong
enough
said
she
and
the
house
purged
of
the
contagion
your
cousins
from
sussex
shall
come
and
stay
a
while
here
with
you
and
afterwards
you
shall
go
with
them
to
their
town
house
and
see
the
sights
of
london
and
now
she
added
looking
out
of
the
window
i
spy
the
good
doctor
make
the
best
of
thyself
dear
heart
lest
he
bleed
thee
and
drench
thee
yet
again
which
i
know
in
my
heart
too
weak
for
it
but
what
do
these
doctors
know
of
babes
their
medicines
are
for
strong
men
the
idea
of
bleeding
was
not
pleasant
to
dickie
though
he
did
not
at
all
know
what
it
meant
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
was
not
nearly
so
tired
as
he
thought
the
excitement
of
all
these
happenings
had
brought
a
pink
flush
to
his
face
and
when
the
doctor
in
a
full
black
robe
and
black
stockings
and
a
pointed
hat
stood
by
his
bedside
and
felt
his
pulse
the
doctor
had
to
own
that
dickie
was
almost
well
we
have
wrought
a
cure
goody
he
said
thou
and
i
we
have
wrought
a
cure
now
kitchen
physic
it
is
that
he
needs
good
broth
and
gruel
and
panada
and
wine
the
rhenish
and
the
french
and
the
juice
of
the
orange
and
the
lemon
or
failing
those
fresh
squeezed
from
the
fruit
when
you
shall
have
brayed
it
in
a
mortar
ha
my
cure
pleases
thee
well
smell
to
it
then
is
many
a
day
since
thou
hadst
the
heart
to
he
reached
the
gold
knob
of
his
cane
to
dickie
nose
and
dickie
was
surprised
to
find
that
it
smelled
sweet
and
strong
something
like
grocers
shops
and
something
like
a
chemist
there
were
little
holes
in
the
gold
knob
such
as
you
see
in
the
tops
of
pepper
castors
and
the
scent
seemed
to
come
through
them
what
is
it
dickie
asked
he
has
forgotten
everything
said
the
nurse
quickly
is
the
good
doctor
pomander
with
spices
and
perfumes
in
it
to
avert
contagion
as
it
warms
in
the
hand
the
perfumes
give
forth
said
the
doctor
now
the
fever
is
past
there
must
be
a
fumigatory
make
a
good
brew
goody
make
a
good
brew
amber
and
nitre
and
wormwood
vinegar
and
quinces
and
myrrh
with
wormwood
camphor
and
the
fresh
flowers
of
the
camomile
and
musk
forget
not
musk
a
strong
thing
against
contagion
let
the
vapor
of
it
pass
to
and
fro
through
the
chamber
burn
the
herbs
from
the
floor
and
all
sweepings
on
this
hearth
strew
fresh
herbs
and
flowers
and
set
all
clean
and
in
order
and
give
thanks
that
you
are
not
setting
all
in
order
for
a
burying
with
which
agreeable
words
the
doctor
nodded
and
smiled
at
the
little
patient
and
went
out
and
now
dickie
literally
did
not
know
where
he
was
it
was
all
so
difficult
was
he
dickie
harding
who
had
lived
at
new
cross
and
sown
the
artistic
parrot
seed
and
taken
the
open
road
with
beale
or
was
he
that
boy
with
the
other
name
whose
father
was
a
knight
and
who
lived
in
a
house
in
deptford
with
green
trees
outside
the
windows
he
could
not
remember
any
house
in
deptford
that
had
green
trees
in
its
garden
and
the
nurse
had
said
something
about
the
pleasant
fields
and
orchards
those
at
any
rate
were
not
in
the
deptford
he
knew
perhaps
there
were
two
deptfords
he
knew
there
were
two
bromptons
and
two
richmonds
one
in
yorkshire
there
was
something
about
the
way
things
happened
at
this
place
that
reminded
him
of
that
nice
lady
talbot
who
had
wanted
him
to
stay
and
be
her
little
boy
perhaps
this
new
boy
whose
place
he
seemed
to
have
taken
had
a
real
mother
of
his
own
as
nice
as
that
nice
lady
the
nurse
had
dropped
all
sorts
of
things
into
an
iron
pot
with
three
legs
and
had
set
it
to
boil
in
the
hot
ashes
now
it
had
boiled
and
two
maids
were
carrying
it
to
and
fro
in
the
room
as
the
doctor
had
said
puffs
of
sweet
strong
spicy
steam
rose
out
of
it
as
they
jerked
it
this
way
and
that
nurse
dickie
called
and
she
came
quickly
nurse
have
i
got
a
mother
she
hugged
him
indeed
thou
hast
she
said
but
she
lies
sick
at
your
father
other
house
and
you
have
a
baby
brother
richard
then
said
dickie
i
think
i
will
stay
here
and
try
to
remember
who
i
am
i
mean
who
you
say
i
am
and
not
try
to
dream
any
more
about
new
cross
and
beale
if
this
is
a
dream
it
a
better
dream
than
the
other
i
want
to
stay
here
nurse
let
me
stay
here
and
see
my
mother
and
my
little
brother
and
shalt
my
lamb
and
shalt
the
nurse
said
and
after
that
there
was
more
food
and
more
sleep
and
nights
and
days
and
talks
and
silences
and
very
gradually
yet
very
quickly
dickie
learned
about
this
new
boy
who
was
and
was
himself
he
told
the
nurse
quite
plainly
that
he
remembered
nothing
about
himself
and
after
he
had
told
her
she
would
sit
by
his
side
by
the
hour
and
tell
him
of
things
that
had
happened
in
the
short
life
of
the
boy
whose
place
he
filled
the
boy
whose
name
was
dickie
harding
and
as
soon
as
she
had
told
him
a
thing
he
found
he
remembered
it
not
as
one
remembers
a
tale
that
is
told
but
as
one
remembers
a
real
thing
that
has
happened
and
days
went
on
and
he
became
surer
and
surer
that
he
was
really
this
other
richard
and
that
he
had
only
dreamed
all
that
old
life
in
new
cross
with
his
aunt
and
in
the
pleasant
country
roads
with
beale
and
he
wondered
how
he
could
ever
have
dreamed
such
things
quite
soon
came
the
day
when
the
nurse
dressed
him
in
clothes
strange
but
strangely
comfortable
and
fine
and
carried
him
to
the
window
from
which
as
he
sat
in
a
big
oak
chair
he
could
see
the
green
fields
that
sloped
down
to
the
river
and
the
rigging
and
the
masts
of
the
ships
that
went
up
and
down
the
rigging
looked
familiar
but
the
shape
of
the
ships
was
quite
different
they
were
shorter
and
broader
than
the
ships
that
dickie
harding
had
been
used
to
see
and
they
most
of
them
rose
up
much
higher
out
of
the
water
i
should
like
to
go
and
look
at
them
closer
he
told
the
nurse
once
healed
she
said
be
forever
running
down
to
the
dockyard
thy
old
way
i
know
thee
hearing
the
master
mariners
tales
and
setting
thy
purpose
for
a
galleon
of
thine
own
and
the
golden
south
americas
what
a
galleon
said
dickie
and
was
told
the
nurse
was
very
patient
with
his
forgettings
he
was
very
happy
there
seemed
somehow
to
be
more
room
in
this
new
life
than
in
the
old
one
and
more
time
no
one
was
in
a
hurry
and
there
was
not
another
house
within
a
quarter
of
a
mile
all
green
fields
also
he
was
a
person
of
consequence
the
servants
called
him
master
richard
and
he
felt
as
he
heard
them
that
being
called
master
richard
meant
not
only
that
the
servants
respected
him
as
their
master
son
but
that
he
was
somebody
from
whom
great
things
were
expected
that
he
had
duties
of
kindness
and
protection
to
the
servants
that
he
was
expected
to
grow
up
brave
and
noble
and
generous
and
unselfish
to
care
for
those
who
called
him
master
he
felt
now
very
fully
what
he
had
felt
vaguely
and
dimly
at
talbot
court
that
he
was
not
the
sort
of
person
who
ought
to
do
anything
mean
and
dishonorable
such
as
being
a
burglar
and
climbing
in
at
pantry
windows
that
when
he
grew
up
he
would
be
expected
to
look
after
his
servants
and
laborers
and
all
the
men
and
women
whom
he
would
have
under
him
that
their
happiness
and
would
be
his
charge
and
the
thought
swelled
his
heart
and
it
seemed
that
he
was
born
to
a
great
destiny
he
little
lame
dickie
harding
of
deptford
he
would
hold
these
people
lives
in
his
hand
well
he
knew
what
poor
people
wanted
he
had
been
poor
or
he
had
dreamed
that
he
was
poor
it
was
all
the
same
dreams
and
real
life
were
so
very
much
alike
so
dickie
changed
every
hour
of
every
day
and
every
moment
of
every
hour
from
the
little
boy
who
lived
at
new
cross
among
the
yellow
houses
and
the
ugliness
who
tramped
the
white
roads
and
slept
at
the
inn
of
the
silver
moon
to
richard
of
the
other
name
who
lived
well
and
slept
softly
and
knew
himself
called
to
a
destiny
of
power
and
helpful
kindness
for
his
nurse
had
told
him
that
his
father
was
a
rich
man
and
that
father
riches
would
be
his
one
day
to
deal
with
for
the
good
of
the
men
under
him
for
their
happiness
and
the
glory
of
god
it
was
a
great
and
beautiful
thought
and
dickie
loved
it
he
loved
indeed
everything
in
this
new
life
the
shapes
and
colors
of
furniture
and
hangings
the
kind
old
nurse
the
friendly
laughing
maids
the
old
doctor
with
his
long
speeches
and
short
smiles
his
bed
his
room
the
ships
the
river
the
trees
the
gardens
the
very
sky
seemed
cleaner
and
brighter
than
the
sky
that
had
been
over
the
deptford
that
dickie
harding
had
known
and
then
came
the
day
when
the
nurse
having
dressed
him
bade
him
walk
to
the
window
instead
of
being
carried
as
so
far
he
had
been
where
he
asked
hesitatingly
where
my
where
have
you
put
the
crutch
then
the
old
nurse
laughed
crutch
she
said
come
out
of
thy
dreams
thou
silly
boy
thou
wants
no
crutch
with
two
fine
straight
strong
legs
like
thou
got
come
use
them
and
walk
dickie
looked
down
at
his
feet
in
the
old
new
cross
days
he
had
not
liked
to
look
at
his
feet
he
had
not
looked
at
them
in
these
new
days
now
he
looked
hesitated
come
said
the
nurse
encouragingly
he
slid
from
the
high
bed
one
might
as
well
try
nurse
seemed
to
think
he
touched
the
ground
with
both
feet
felt
the
floor
firm
and
even
under
them
as
firm
and
even
under
the
one
foot
as
under
the
other
he
stood
up
straight
moved
the
foot
that
he
had
been
used
to
move
then
the
other
the
one
that
he
had
never
moved
he
took
two
steps
three
four
and
then
he
turned
suddenly
and
flung
himself
against
the
side
of
the
bed
and
hid
his
face
in
his
arms
what
weeping
my
lamb
the
nurse
said
and
came
to
him
oh
nurse
he
cried
clinging
to
her
with
all
his
might
i
dreamed
that
i
was
lame
and
i
thought
it
was
true
and
it
is
it
is
it
is
quite
soon
dickie
was
able
to
walk
and
out
into
the
garden
along
the
grassy
walks
and
long
alleys
where
fruit
trees
trained
over
trellises
made
such
pleasant
green
shade
and
even
to
try
to
learn
to
play
at
bowls
on
the
long
behind
the
house
the
house
was
by
far
the
finest
house
dickie
had
ever
been
in
and
the
garden
was
more
beautiful
even
than
the
garden
at
talbot
court
but
it
was
not
only
the
beauty
of
the
house
and
garden
that
made
dickie
life
a
new
and
full
delight
to
limp
along
the
leafy
ways
to
crawl
up
and
down
the
carved
staircase
would
have
been
a
pleasure
greater
than
any
dickie
had
ever
known
but
he
could
leap
up
and
down
the
stairs
three
at
a
time
he
could
run
in
the
arched
alleys
run
and
jump
as
he
had
seen
other
children
do
and
as
he
had
never
thought
to
do
himself
imagine
what
you
would
feel
if
you
had
lived
wingless
all
your
life
among
people
who
could
fly
that
is
how
lame
people
feel
among
us
who
can
walk
and
run
and
now
dickie
was
lame
no
more
his
feet
seemed
not
only
to
be
strong
and
active
but
clever
on
their
own
account
they
carried
him
quite
without
mistake
to
the
at
the
village
on
the
hill
to
the
centre
of
the
maze
of
clipped
hedges
that
was
the
centre
of
the
garden
and
best
of
all
they
carried
him
to
the
dockyard
girls
like
dolls
and
and
but
boys
like
to
see
things
made
and
done
else
how
is
it
that
any
boy
worth
his
salt
will
leave
the
newest
and
brightest
toys
to
follow
a
carpenter
or
a
plumber
round
the
house
fiddle
with
his
tools
ask
him
a
thousand
questions
and
watch
him
ply
his
trade
dickie
at
new
cross
had
spent
many
an
hour
watching
those
interesting
men
who
open
square
in
the
pavement
and
drag
out
from
them
yards
and
yards
of
wire
i
do
not
know
why
the
men
do
this
but
every
london
boy
who
reads
this
will
know
and
when
he
got
to
the
dockyard
his
obliging
feet
carried
him
to
a
man
in
a
great
leather
apron
busy
with
great
beams
of
wood
and
tools
that
dickie
had
never
seen
and
the
man
greeted
him
as
an
old
friend
kissed
him
on
both
cheeks
which
he
did
expect
and
felt
much
too
old
for
and
spread
a
sack
for
him
that
he
might
sit
in
the
sun
on
a
big
baulk
of
timber
a
sight
for
sore
eyes
master
richard
he
said
it
many
a
long
day
since
thou
was
here
to
pester
me
with
thy
questions
and
strong
again
no
bones
broken
and
now
i
teach
thee
to
make
a
galleon
like
as
i
promised
will
you
indeed
said
dickie
trembling
with
joy
and
pride
that
will
i
said
the
man
and
threw
up
his
pointed
beard
in
a
jolly
laugh
and
see
what
i
made
thee
while
been
lazying
in
bed
a
real
english
ship
of
war
he
laid
down
the
auger
he
held
and
went
into
a
low
rough
shed
and
next
moment
came
out
with
a
little
ship
in
his
hand
a
perfect
model
of
the
strange
ships
dickie
could
see
on
the
river
illustration
is
the
picture
said
he
proudly
my
old
ship
the
golden
venture
is
the
picture
said
he
proudly
of
my
old
ship
golden
that
i
sailed
in
with
master
raleigh
and
help
to
sink
the
accursed
armada
and
clip
the
king
of
spain
his
wings
and
singe
his
beard
the
armada
said
dickie
with
a
new
and
quite
strange
feeling
rather
like
going
down
unexpectedly
in
a
lift
the
armada
what
other
asked
the
heard
the
story
a
thousand
times
i
want
to
hear
it
again
dickie
said
and
heard
the
story
of
great
danger
and
her
great
escapes
it
was
just
the
same
story
as
the
one
you
read
in
your
history
book
and
yet
how
different
when
it
was
told
by
a
man
who
had
been
there
who
had
felt
the
danger
known
the
escape
dickie
held
his
breath
and
so
the
story
ended
the
breath
of
the
lord
went
forth
and
the
storm
blew
and
fell
on
the
fleet
of
spain
and
scattered
them
and
they
went
down
in
our
very
waters
they
and
their
arms
and
their
treasure
their
guns
and
their
gunners
their
mariners
and
their
and
the
remnant
was
scattered
and
driven
northward
and
some
were
wrecked
on
the
rocks
and
some
our
ships
met
and
dealt
with
and
some
poor
few
made
shift
to
get
back
across
the
sea
trailing
home
like
wounded
mallards
to
tell
the
king
their
master
what
the
lord
had
done
for
england
how
long
ago
was
it
all
this
dickie
asked
if
his
memory
served
it
was
hundreds
of
years
ago
three
five
he
could
not
remember
how
many
but
hundreds
could
this
man
whose
hair
was
only
just
touched
with
gray
be
hundreds
of
years
old
how
long
a
matter
of
twenty
years
or
thereabouts
said
the
see
the
pretty
little
ship
and
thy
very
own
for
i
made
it
for
thee
it
was
indeed
a
pretty
little
ship
being
a
perfect
model
of
an
elizabethan
ship
built
up
high
at
bow
and
stern
for
as
sebastian
explained
majesty
and
terror
of
the
enemy
and
with
deck
and
orlop
waist
and
poop
hold
and
masts
all
complete
with
forecastle
and
cabin
masts
and
spars
and
guns
sails
anchor
and
carved
the
woodwork
was
painted
in
white
and
green
and
red
and
at
bow
and
stern
was
richly
carved
and
gilded
for
me
dickie
said
really
for
me
and
you
made
it
yourself
truth
to
tell
i
began
it
long
since
in
the
long
winter
evenings
said
his
friend
and
now
is
done
and
is
thine
see
i
shall
put
an
apron
on
thee
and
thou
shalt
be
my
and
learn
to
build
another
quaint
ship
like
her
to
be
her
consort
and
we
will
sail
them
together
in
the
pond
in
thy
father
garden
dickie
still
devouring
the
little
with
his
eyes
submitted
to
the
leather
apron
and
felt
in
his
hand
the
smooth
handle
of
the
tool
sebastian
put
there
but
he
said
i
do
understand
you
remember
the
armada
twenty
years
ago
i
thought
it
was
hundreds
and
hundreds
twenty
years
ago
or
nearer
eighteen
said
sebastian
have
to
learn
to
reckon
better
than
that
if
to
be
my
was
in
the
year
of
grace
and
we
are
now
in
the
year
this
makes
it
eighteen
years
to
my
reckoning
it
was
in
my
dream
said
dickie
i
mean
in
my
fever
in
fever
sebastian
said
folk
travel
far
now
hold
the
wood
so
and
the
knife
thus
then
every
day
dickie
went
down
to
the
dockyard
when
lessons
were
done
for
there
were
lessons
now
with
a
tutor
in
a
black
gown
whom
dickie
disliked
extremely
the
tutor
did
not
seem
to
like
dickie
either
the
child
hath
forgot
in
his
fever
all
that
ever
he
learned
of
me
he
complained
to
the
old
nurse
who
nodded
wisely
and
said
he
would
soon
learn
all
afresh
and
he
did
very
quickly
learn
a
great
deal
and
always
it
was
more
like
remembering
than
learning
and
a
second
tutor
very
smart
in
red
velvet
and
gold
with
breeches
like
balloons
and
a
short
cloak
and
a
ruff
who
was
an
extremely
jolly
fellow
came
in
the
mornings
to
teach
him
to
fence
to
dance
and
to
run
and
to
leap
and
to
play
bowls
and
promised
in
due
time
to
teach
him
wrestling
catching
archery
rackets
riding
tennis
and
all
sports
and
games
proper
for
a
youth
of
gentle
blood
and
weeks
went
by
and
still
his
father
and
mother
had
not
come
and
he
had
learned
a
little
greek
and
more
latin
could
carve
a
box
with
the
arms
of
his
house
on
the
lid
and
make
that
lid
fit
could
bow
like
a
courtier
and
speak
like
a
gentleman
and
play
a
simple
air
on
the
viol
that
hung
in
the
parlor
for
guests
to
amuse
themselves
with
while
they
waited
to
see
the
master
or
mistress
and
then
came
the
day
when
old
nurse
dressed
him
in
his
best
a
suit
of
cut
velvet
purple
slashed
with
and
a
belt
with
a
little
sword
to
it
and
a
flat
cap
and
master
henry
the
took
him
in
a
little
boat
to
a
gilded
galley
full
of
gentlemen
and
ladies
all
finely
dressed
who
kissed
him
and
made
much
of
him
and
said
how
he
was
grown
since
the
fever
and
one
gentleman
very
fine
indeed
appeared
to
be
his
uncle
and
a
most
charming
lady
in
blue
and
silver
seemed
to
be
his
aunt
and
a
very
jolly
little
boy
and
girl
who
sat
by
him
and
talked
merrily
all
the
while
were
his
little
cousins
cups
of
wine
and
silver
dishes
of
fruit
and
cakes
were
handed
round
the
galley
was
decked
with
fresh
flowers
and
from
another
boat
quite
near
came
the
sound
of
music
the
sun
shone
overhead
and
the
clear
river
sparkled
and
more
and
more
boats
all
gilded
and
appeared
on
the
water
then
there
was
a
sound
of
shouting
the
river
suddenly
grew
alive
with
the
glitter
of
drawn
swords
the
butterfly
glitter
of
ladies
waved
scarves
and
handkerchiefs
and
a
great
gilded
barge
came
slowly
followed
by
a
procession
of
smaller
craft
every
one
in
the
galley
stood
up
the
gentlemen
saluted
with
their
drawn
swords
the
ladies
fluttered
their
scarves
illustration
the
galley
was
decked
with
fresh
flowers
his
majesty
and
the
queen
the
little
cousins
whispered
as
the
state
barge
went
by
then
all
the
galleys
fell
into
place
behind
the
king
barge
and
the
long
beautiful
procession
went
slowly
on
down
the
river
dickie
was
very
happy
the
little
cousins
were
so
friendly
and
jolly
the
people
so
kind
everything
so
beautiful
and
so
clean
it
was
a
perfect
day
the
river
was
very
beautiful
it
ran
between
banks
of
willows
and
alders
where
loosestrife
and
meadowsweet
and
and
yarrow
grew
tall
and
thick
there
were
in
shady
and
beautiful
gardens
sloping
down
to
the
water
at
last
the
boats
came
to
a
pretty
little
town
among
trees
this
is
where
we
disembark
said
the
little
girl
cousin
the
king
lies
here
at
sir
thomas
bradbury
and
we
lie
at
our
grandfather
house
and
it
is
the
masque
in
sir
park
and
we
are
to
see
it
i
am
glad
well
of
thy
fever
richard
i
should
have
liked
it
half
so
well
if
thou
had
been
here
she
said
smiling
and
of
course
that
was
a
very
nice
thing
to
have
said
to
one
and
then
we
go
home
to
deptford
with
thee
said
the
boy
cousin
we
are
to
stay
a
month
and
we
see
thy
galleon
and
get
old
sebastian
to
make
me
one
too
yes
said
dickie
as
the
boat
came
against
the
quay
what
this
place
gravesend
thou
knowest
that
said
the
little
cousins
or
hadst
thou
forgotten
that
too
in
thy
fever
gravesend
dickie
repeated
in
quite
a
changed
voice
come
children
said
the
aunt
oh
what
a
different
aunt
to
the
one
who
had
slapped
dickie
in
deptford
sold
the
and
shot
the
moon
you
boys
remember
how
i
showed
you
to
carry
my
train
and
my
girl
will
not
forget
how
to
fling
the
flowers
from
the
gilt
basket
as
the
king
and
queen
come
down
the
steps
the
grandfather
house
and
garden
the
stately
grandfather
whom
they
called
my
lord
and
who
was
it
seemed
the
aunt
father
the
banquet
the
the
gardens
lit
up
by
little
colored
oil
lamps
hung
in
festoons
from
tree
to
tree
the
blazing
torches
the
music
the
masque
a
sort
of
play
without
words
in
which
every
one
wore
the
most
wonderful
and
beautiful
dresses
and
the
queen
herself
took
a
part
dressed
all
in
gauze
and
jewels
and
white
feathers
all
these
things
were
like
a
dream
to
dickie
and
through
it
all
the
words
kept
on
saying
themselves
to
him
very
gently
very
quietly
and
quite
without
stopping
gravesend
that
where
the
is
where
beale
is
waiting
for
you
the
man
you
called
father
you
promised
to
go
there
as
soon
as
you
could
why
have
you
gone
gravesend
that
where
the
is
where
beale
and
so
on
over
and
over
again
and
how
can
any
one
enjoy
anything
when
this
sort
of
thing
keeps
on
saying
itself
under
and
over
and
through
and
between
everything
he
sees
and
hears
and
feels
and
thinks
and
the
worst
of
it
was
that
now
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
found
that
he
was
not
lame
he
felt
more
than
felt
he
knew
that
the
old
new
cross
life
had
not
been
a
fever
dream
and
that
beale
who
had
been
kind
to
him
and
taken
him
through
the
pleasant
country
and
slept
with
him
in
the
bed
with
the
green
curtains
was
really
waiting
for
him
at
gravesend
and
this
is
all
a
dream
said
dickie
and
i
wake
up
but
he
could
wake
up
and
the
trees
and
grass
and
lights
and
beautiful
things
the
kindly
great
people
with
their
splendid
dresses
the
king
and
queen
the
aunts
and
uncles
and
the
little
cousins
all
these
things
refused
to
fade
away
and
jumble
themselves
up
as
things
do
in
dreams
they
remained
solid
and
real
he
knew
that
this
must
be
a
dream
and
that
beale
and
gravesend
and
new
cross
and
the
old
lame
life
were
the
real
thing
and
yet
he
could
not
wake
up
all
the
same
the
light
had
gone
out
of
everything
and
it
is
small
wonder
that
when
he
got
home
at
last
very
tired
indeed
to
his
father
house
at
deptford
he
burst
into
tears
as
nurse
was
undressing
him
what
ails
my
lamb
she
asked
i
ca
explain
you
would
understand
said
dickie
try
said
she
very
earnestly
he
looked
round
the
room
at
the
tapestries
and
the
heavy
furniture
i
ca
he
said
try
she
said
again
it
do
laugh
nurse
there
a
dream
that
feels
real
about
a
dreadful
place
oh
so
different
from
this
but
there
a
man
waiting
there
for
me
that
was
good
to
me
when
i
was
when
i
was
that
was
good
to
me
he
waiting
in
the
dream
and
i
want
to
get
back
to
him
and
i
ca
better
here
than
in
that
dreadful
place
said
the
nurse
stroking
his
hair
yes
but
beale
i
know
he
waiting
there
i
wish
i
could
bring
him
here
not
yet
said
the
nurse
surprisingly
is
not
easy
to
bring
those
we
love
from
one
dream
to
another
one
dream
to
another
didst
never
hear
that
all
life
is
a
dream
she
asked
him
but
thou
shalt
go
heaven
forbid
that
one
of
thy
race
should
fail
a
friend
look
there
are
fresh
sheets
on
thy
bed
lie
still
and
think
of
him
that
was
good
to
thee
he
lay
there
very
still
he
had
decided
to
wake
up
to
wake
up
to
the
old
hard
cruel
life
to
poverty
dulness
lameness
there
was
no
other
thing
to
be
done
he
wake
up
and
keep
his
promise
to
beale
but
it
was
hard
hard
hard
the
beautiful
house
the
beautiful
garden
the
games
the
the
soft
clothes
the
kind
people
the
uplifting
sense
that
he
was
somebody
yet
he
must
go
yes
if
he
could
he
would
the
nurse
had
taken
burning
wood
from
the
hearth
and
set
it
on
a
silver
plate
now
she
strewed
something
on
the
glowing
embers
lie
straight
and
still
she
said
and
wish
thyself
where
thou
wast
when
thou
leftest
that
dream
he
did
so
a
thick
sweet
smoke
rose
from
the
little
fire
in
the
silver
plate
and
the
nurse
was
chanting
something
in
a
very
low
voice
men
die
man
dies
not
times
fly
time
flies
not
that
was
all
he
heard
though
he
heard
confusedly
that
there
was
more
he
seemed
to
sink
deep
into
a
soft
sea
of
sleep
to
be
rocked
on
its
tide
and
then
to
be
flung
by
its
waves
roughly
suddenly
on
some
hard
shore
of
awakening
he
opened
his
eyes
he
was
in
the
little
bare
front
room
in
new
cross
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
lay
on
the
floor
among
white
moonflower
seeds
confusedly
scattered
and
the
gas
lamp
from
the
street
shone
through
the
dirty
panes
on
the
newspapers
and
sacking
what
a
dream
said
dickie
shivering
and
very
sleepy
oh
what
a
dream
he
put
tinkler
and
the
seal
in
one
pocket
gathered
up
the
and
put
them
in
the
other
drew
the
old
newspapers
over
him
and
went
to
sleep
the
morning
sun
woke
him
how
odd
said
he
to
dream
all
that
weeks
and
weeks
in
just
a
little
bit
of
one
little
night
if
it
had
only
been
true
he
jumped
up
eager
to
start
for
gravesend
since
he
had
wakened
out
of
that
wonderful
dream
on
purpose
to
go
to
gravesend
he
might
as
well
start
at
once
but
his
jump
ended
in
a
sickening
sideways
fall
and
his
head
knocked
against
the
wainscot
i
had
forgotten
he
said
slowly
i
should
have
thought
any
dream
could
have
made
me
forget
about
my
foot
for
he
had
indeed
forgotten
it
had
leaped
up
eagerly
confidently
as
a
sound
child
leaps
and
the
lame
foot
had
betrayed
him
thrown
him
down
he
crawled
across
to
where
the
crutch
lay
the
old
broom
cut
down
that
lady
talbot
had
covered
with
black
velvet
for
him
and
now
he
said
i
must
get
to
gravesend
he
looked
out
of
the
window
at
the
dismal
sordid
street
i
wonder
he
said
if
deptford
was
ever
really
like
it
was
in
my
dream
the
gardens
and
the
clean
river
and
the
fields
he
got
out
of
the
house
when
no
one
was
looking
and
went
off
down
the
street
went
the
crutch
on
the
dusty
pavement
his
back
ached
his
lame
foot
hurt
his
good
leg
was
tired
and
stiff
and
his
heart
too
was
very
tired
about
this
time
in
the
dream
he
had
chosen
to
awaken
from
for
the
sake
of
beale
a
bowl
of
porridge
would
be
smoking
at
the
end
of
a
long
oak
table
and
a
great
carved
chair
be
set
for
a
little
boy
who
was
not
there
dickie
strode
on
manfully
but
the
pain
in
his
back
made
him
feel
sick
i
do
know
as
i
can
do
it
he
said
then
he
saw
the
three
gold
balls
above
the
door
of
the
friendly
pawnbroker
he
looked
hesitated
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
went
in
hullo
said
the
pawnbroker
here
we
are
again
want
to
pawn
the
rattle
eh
no
said
dickie
but
what
you
give
me
on
the
seal
you
gave
me
the
pawnbroker
stared
frowned
and
burst
out
laughing
if
you
do
beat
all
he
said
i
give
you
a
present
and
you
come
to
pledge
it
with
me
you
should
have
been
one
of
our
people
so
you
want
to
pledge
the
seal
well
well
i
much
rather
not
said
dickie
seriously
because
i
love
it
very
much
but
i
must
have
my
fare
to
gravesend
my
father
there
waiting
for
me
and
i
do
want
to
leave
tinkler
behind
he
showed
the
rattle
what
the
fare
to
gravesend
do
know
i
thought
you
know
will
you
give
me
the
fare
for
the
seal
the
pawnbroker
hesitated
and
looked
hard
at
him
no
he
said
no
the
seal
not
worth
it
not
but
what
it
a
very
good
seal
he
added
very
good
indeed
see
here
said
dickie
suddenly
i
know
what
honor
is
now
and
the
word
of
a
gentleman
you
will
not
let
me
pledge
the
seal
with
you
then
let
me
pledge
my
word
my
word
of
honor
lend
me
the
money
to
take
me
to
gravesend
and
by
the
honor
of
a
gentleman
i
will
repay
you
within
a
month
the
voice
was
firm
the
accent
though
strange
was
not
the
accent
of
deptford
street
boys
it
was
the
accent
of
the
boy
who
had
had
two
tutors
and
a
big
garden
a
place
in
the
king
and
a
knowledge
of
what
it
means
to
belong
to
a
noble
house
the
pawnbroker
looked
at
him
with
the
unerring
instinct
of
his
race
he
knew
that
this
was
not
that
there
was
something
behind
it
something
real
the
sense
of
romance
of
great
things
all
about
them
transcending
the
ordinary
things
of
life
this
in
the
jews
has
survived
centuries
of
torment
shame
cruelty
and
oppression
this
inherited
sense
of
romance
in
the
pawnbroker
now
leaped
to
answer
dickie
appeal
and
i
do
hope
i
am
not
confusing
you
stick
to
it
read
it
again
if
you
do
understand
what
i
mean
is
that
the
jews
always
see
the
big
beautiful
things
they
do
just
see
that
gray
is
made
of
black
and
white
they
see
how
incredibly
black
black
can
be
and
that
there
may
be
a
whiteness
transcending
all
the
whitest
dreams
in
the
world
you
a
rum
little
chap
was
what
the
pawnbroker
said
but
i
like
your
pluck
every
man
got
to
make
a
fool
of
himself
one
time
or
the
other
he
added
apologizing
to
the
spirit
of
business
you
mean
you
will
said
dickie
eagerly
more
fool
me
said
the
jew
feeling
in
his
pocket
you
wo
be
sorry
not
in
the
end
you
wo
said
dickie
as
the
pawnbroker
laid
certain
monies
before
him
on
the
mahogany
counter
you
lend
me
this
you
trust
me
looks
like
it
said
the
jew
then
some
day
i
shall
do
something
for
you
i
do
know
what
but
something
we
never
forget
we
he
stopped
he
remembered
that
he
was
poor
little
lame
dickie
harding
with
no
right
to
that
other
name
which
had
been
his
in
the
dream
he
picked
up
the
coins
put
them
in
his
pocket
felt
the
i
can
not
repay
your
kindness
he
said
though
some
day
i
will
repay
your
silver
but
these
seeds
the
he
pulled
out
a
handful
you
liked
the
flowers
he
handed
a
generous
score
across
the
polished
wood
thank
you
my
lad
said
the
pawnbroker
i
raise
them
in
gentle
heat
i
think
they
grow
best
by
moonlight
said
dickie
so
he
came
to
gravesend
and
the
common
and
a
weary
sad
and
very
anxious
man
rose
up
from
his
place
by
the
fire
when
the
of
the
crutch
sounded
on
the
threshold
it
the
nipper
he
said
and
came
very
quickly
to
the
door
and
got
his
arm
round
dickie
shoulders
the
little
nipper
so
it
ai
i
thought
you
got
pinched
no
i
did
i
knew
your
clever
ways
i
knew
you
was
bound
to
turn
up
yes
said
dickie
looking
round
the
tramps
kitchen
and
remembering
the
long
clean
of
his
dream
yes
i
was
bound
to
turn
up
you
wanted
me
to
did
you
he
added
wanted
you
to
beale
answered
holding
him
close
and
looking
at
him
as
men
look
at
some
rare
treasure
gained
with
much
cost
and
after
long
seeking
wanted
you
not
i
think
and
drew
him
in
and
shut
the
door
then
i
glad
i
came
said
dickie
but
in
his
heart
he
was
not
glad
in
his
heart
he
longed
for
that
pleasant
house
where
he
was
the
young
master
and
was
not
lame
any
more
but
in
his
soul
he
was
glad
because
the
soul
is
greater
than
the
heart
and
knows
greater
things
and
now
dickie
loved
beale
more
than
ever
because
for
him
he
had
sacrificed
his
dream
so
he
had
gained
something
because
loving
people
is
the
best
thing
in
the
world
better
even
than
being
loved
just
think
this
out
will
you
and
see
if
i
am
not
right
there
were
herrings
for
tea
and
in
the
hard
bed
with
his
clothes
and
his
boots
under
the
pillows
dickie
slept
soundly
but
he
did
not
dream
yet
when
he
woke
in
the
morning
remembering
many
things
he
said
to
himself
is
this
the
dream
or
was
the
other
the
dream
and
it
seemed
a
foolish
question
with
the
feel
of
the
coarse
sheets
and
the
smell
of
the
close
room
and
beale
voice
saying
rouse
up
nipper
there
sossingers
for
breakfast
chapter
v
to
get
your
own
living
no
said
beale
we
ai
to
crack
no
more
cribs
low
that
what
it
is
i
quite
grant
you
it
low
so
i
to
take
the
road
again
dickie
and
he
were
sitting
in
the
sunshine
on
a
sloping
field
they
had
been
sitting
there
all
the
morning
and
dickie
had
told
beale
all
his
earthly
adventures
from
the
moment
the
redheaded
man
had
lifted
him
up
to
the
window
of
talbot
court
to
the
time
when
he
had
come
in
by
the
open
door
of
the
common
what
a
nipper
it
is
though
said
beale
regretfully
for
the
burgling
i
mean
sharp
clever
no
one
to
touch
him
but
i
do
cotton
to
it
myself
he
added
quickly
not
the
burgling
i
do
always
liable
to
get
yourself
into
trouble
over
it
one
way
or
the
other
that
the
worst
of
it
i
do
know
how
it
is
he
ended
pensively
but
somehow
it
leads
to
trouble
dickie
picked
up
seven
straws
from
among
the
stubble
and
idly
plaited
them
together
the
nurse
had
taught
him
this
in
the
dream
when
he
was
still
weak
from
the
fever
that
very
flash
that
what
you
doing
said
beale
who
learned
you
that
i
learned
it
in
a
dream
said
dickie
slowly
i
dreamed
i
a
fever
and
i
tell
you
if
you
like
it
a
good
yarn
good
as
here
ward
very
near
beale
lay
back
on
the
dry
stubble
his
pipe
between
his
teeth
fire
away
he
said
and
dickie
fired
away
when
the
long
tale
ended
the
sun
was
beginning
to
go
down
towards
its
bed
in
the
west
there
was
a
pause
you
make
a
tidy
bit
on
the
said
beale
quite
awestruck
the
things
you
think
of
when
did
you
make
all
that
up
i
dreamed
it
i
tell
you
said
dickie
you
always
could
stick
it
on
said
beale
admiringly
i
ai
goin
to
stick
it
on
never
no
more
said
dickie
they
called
it
lying
and
cheating
where
i
was
in
my
dream
i
mean
once
let
a
nipper
out
of
yer
sight
said
beale
sadly
and

what
comes
of
it
to
stick
it
on
no
more
then

get
a
honest
living

dickie

said
beale
shortly

dickie
but
i
started
learning
a
lot
of
things

in
the
dream
i
did
and
i
started
making
a
boat

galleon

could
not
help
noticing
the
dirty
shirt
the
dirty
face
the
three
days
beard
the
filthy
clothes
of
his
friend
and
he
thought
of
his
other
friend
sebastian
of
the
docks
he
saw
the
pale
blue
reproachful
eyes
of
beale
looking
out
of
that
dirty
face
and
he
spoke
aloud
quite
without
meaning
to
all
that
do
make
no
difference
he
said

miserable
angry
eyes

held
the
rattle
out
beale
took
it
it
a
fancy
bit
i
will
say
he
owned
look
said
dickie
what
i
mean
to
say
he
stopped
what
was
the
use
of
telling
beale
that
he
had
come
back
out
of
the
dream
just
for
sake
beale
who
did
not
believe
in

he
added
i
ai
no

wiv
me

at

you

dickie
suppressed
a
wild
notion
he
had
had
of
getting
into
that
dream
again
learning
some
useful
trade
there
waking
up
and
teaching
it
to
beale
ai
there

asked

dickie
wondered
whether

learned
to
do
with
your
hands
the
greek
and
the

and
sang
in
his
brain
encouragingly

dream
he
said

a
dream

with
bitter
my

stretched
himself
and

he
said

i
do

i
likes
it
let

so
they
went
back
to
the
gravesend
next
day
beale
produced
the
lonely
leg
of
a
sofa
mahogany
a
fat
round
turned
leg
old
and
seasoned
this
what
you

he
asked
dickie
took
it
eagerly

he
said
i
feel
just
exactly
like
as
if
i
could
i
say
farver
let
get
out
in
the
woods
somewheres
quiet
and
take
our
grub
along
somewheres
where
nobody
say

up
to
and
make
a
mock
of
me
they
found
a
place
such
as
dickie
desired
a
warm
sunny
nest
in
the
heart
of
a
green
wood
and
all
through
the
long
warm
hours
of
the
autumn
day
beale
lay
lazy
in
the
sunshine
while
dickie
very
pale
and
determined
sliced
chipped
and
picked
at
the
sofa
leg
with
the
knife
the
gardener
had
given
him
it
was
hard
to
make
him
lay
the
work
down
even
for
dinner
which
was
of
a
delicious
and
extravagant
kind
new
bread
german
sausage
and
beer
in
a
flat
bottle
for
from
the
moment
when
the
knife
touched
the
wood
dickie
knew
that
he
had
not
forgotten
and
that
what
he
had
done
in
the
deptford
dockyard
under
the
eyes
of
sebastian
the
shipwright
who
had
helped
to
sink
the
armada
he
could
do
now
alone
in
the
woods
beyond
gravesend
it
was
after
dinner
that
beale
began
to
be
interested
swelp
me
he
said
but
you
got
the
hang
of
it
somehow

box

dickie
smoothing
a
rough
corner
a
box

a
lid

it
and
stuck
to
it
and
stuck
to
it
till
there
was
hardly

left
to
see
it
by
but
before
the
light
was
wholly
gone
the
box
had
wholly
come
with
the
carved
coat
of
arms
and
the
lid
that
fitted

said
a
dingy
gray
old
man
sitting
apart
for
some
reason
of
his
own
beale
let
the
old
man
take
the
box
into
his
hand
but
he
kept
very
close
to
him
and
he
kept
his
eyes
on
the
box
all
outer
one
piece
said
the
old
man
i
dunno

an
i

but
that
was
made
by
a
workman

trade
i

a
once
though
you
would
think
it
to
look
at
me

little
hobjec
worth

up
with

on
yer
trouser
leg
to
shine

and
then
rub

in
the
mud
to
dirty
it
and
then
hoil
it
again
and
dirty

again
and
you

a
thick
for

as
a
genuwine
hold
antique

thankee
daddy
said
beale
an
so
i
will
he
slipped
the
box
in
his
pocket
when
dickie
next
saw
the
box
it
looked
as
old
as
any
box
need
look
now
we
look
out
for
a
shop
where
they
sells
these
hold
antics
said
beale
they
were
on
the
road
and
their
faces
were
set
towards
london
dickie
face
looked
pinched
and
white
beale
noticed
it
you
do
look
up
to
much
he
said
war
your
bed
to
your
liking
the
bed
was
all
right
said
dickie
thinking
of
the
bed
in
the
dream
i
diden
sleep
much
though
any
more
dreams
beale
asked
kindly
enough
no
said
dickie
i
think
it
was
me
wanting
so
to
dream
it
again
kep
me
awake
i
dessey
said
beale
picking
up
a
straw
to
chew
dickie
limped
along
in
the
dust
the
world
seemed
very
big
and
hard
it
was
a
long
way
to
london
and
he
had
not
been
able
to
dream
that
dream
again
perhaps
he
would
never
be
able
to
dream
it
he
stumbled
on
a
big
stone
and
would
have
fallen
but
that
beale
caught
him
by
the
arm
and
as
he
swung
round
by
that
arm
beale
saw
that
the
boy
eyes
were
thick
with
tears
ai
yerself
yer
he
said
for
in
all
their
wanderings
these
were
the
first
tears
dickie
had
shed
no
said
dickie
and
hid
his
face
against
beale
coat
sleeve
only
what
is
it
then
said
beale
in
the
accents
of
tenderness
tell
your
old
farver
then
it
silly
sobbed
dickie
never
you
mind
whether
it
silly
or
not
said
beale
you
out
with
it
in
that
dream
said
dickie
i
was
lame
think
of
that
now
said
beale
admiringly
you
best
dream
that
every
night
then
you
wo
mind
so
much
of
a
daytime
but
i
mind
more
said
dickie
sniffing
hard
much
much
more
beale
without
more
words
made
room
for
him
in
the
crowded
perambulator
and
they
went
on
dickie
sniffs
subsided
silence
presently
i
say
farver
i
sorry
i
acted
so
silly
you
never
see
me
blub
afore
and
you
wo
again
he
said
and
beale
said
awkwardly
that
all
right
mate
you
pretty
flush
the
boy
asked
later
on
not
so
dusty
said
the
man
i
wanter
give
that
there
little
box
to
a
chap
i
know
wot
lent
me
the
money
for
the
train
to
come
to
you
at
gravesend
pay
some
other
day
when
we
flusher
i
rather
pay
now
said
dickie
i
could
make
another
box
there
a
bit
of
the
sofer
leg
left
ai
there
there
was
and
dickie
worked
away
at
it
in
the
odd
moments
that
cluster
round
meal
times
the
before
bed
and
before
the
morning
start
beale
begged
of
all
likely
but
he
noted
that
the
nipper
no
longer
stuck
it
on
for
the
most
part
he
was
quite
silent
only
when
beale
appealed
to
him
he
would
say
farver
very
good
to
me
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
without
farver
and
so
at
last
they
came
to
new
cross
again
and
beale
stepped
in
for
half
a
pint
at
the
railway
hotel
while
dickie
went
along
the
pavement
to
his
friend
the
pawnbroker
here
we
are
again
said
that
tradesman
come
to
pawn
the
rattle
dickie
laughed
pawning
the
rattle
seemed
suddenly
to
have
become
a
very
old
and
good
joke
between
them
look
mister
he
said
that
chink
wot
you
lent
me
to
get
to
gravesend
with
he
paused
and
added
in
his
other
voice
it
was
very
good
of
you
sir
i
not
going
to
lend
you
any
more
if
that
what
you
after
said
the
jew
who
had
already
reproached
himself
for
his
confiding
generosity
it
not
that
i
after
said
dickie
with
dignity
i
wish
to
repay
you
got
the
money
said
the
jew
laughing
not
unkindly
no
said
dickie
but
i
got
this
he
handed
the
little
box
across
the
counter
where
you
get
it
i
made
it
the
pawnbroker
laughed
again
well
well
i
ask
no
questions
and
you
tell
me
no
lies
eh
i
shall
certainly
tell
you
no
lies
said
dickie
with
the
dignity
of
the
dream
boy
who
was
not
a
cripple
and
was
heir
to
a
great
and
gentle
name
will
you
take
it
instead
of
the
money
the
pawnbroker
turned
the
box
over
in
his
hands
while
kindness
and
honesty
struggled
fiercely
within
him
against
the
habits
of
a
business
life
dickie
eyed
the
china
vases
and
concertinas
and
teaspoons
tied
together
in
fan
shape
and
waited
silently
it
worth
more
than
what
i
lent
you
the
man
said
at
last
with
an
effort
and
it
is
every
one
who
would
own
that
mind
you
i
know
it
is
said
dickie
will
you
please
take
it
to
pay
my
debt
to
you
and
if
it
is
worth
more
accept
it
as
a
grateful
gift
from
one
who
is
still
gratefully
your
debtor
you
make
your
fortune
on
the
halls
said
the
man
as
beale
had
said
the
way
you
talk
beats
everything
all
serene
i
take
the
box
in
full
discharge
of
your
debt
but
you
might
as
well
tell
me
where
you
got
it
i
made
it
said
dickie
and
put
his
lips
together
very
tightly
you
did
did
you
then
i
tell
you
what
i
give
you
four
bob
for
every
one
of
them
you
make
and
bring
to
me
you
might
do
different
coats
of
arms
see
i
was
only
taught
to
do
one
said
dickie
just
then
a
customer
came
in
a
woman
with
her
sunday
dress
and
a
pair
of
sheets
to
pawn
because
her
man
was
out
of
work
and
the
children
were
hungry
run
along
now
said
the
jew
i
nothing
more
for
you
dickie
flushed
and
went
three
days
later
the
crutch
clattered
in
at
the
pawnbroker
door
and
dickie
laid
two
more
little
boxes
on
the
counter
here
you
are
he
said
the
pawnbroker
looked
and
exclaimed
and
questioned
and
wondered
and
dickie
went
away
with
eight
silver
shillings
in
his
pocket
the
first
coins
he
had
ever
carried
in
his
life
they
seemed
to
have
been
coined
in
some
fairy
mint
they
were
so
different
from
any
other
money
he
had
ever
handled
beale
waiting
for
him
by
new
cross
station
put
his
empty
pipe
in
his
pocket
and
strolled
down
to
meet
him
dickie
drew
him
down
a
side
street
and
held
out
the
silver
two
days
work
he
said
we
ai
no
call
to
take
the
road
for
a
pleasure
trip
i
got
a
trade
i
much
a
week
four
bob
a
day
bob
i
make
it
lor
said
beale
with
his
mouth
open
now
i
tell
you
what
you
get
of
some
more
old
sofy
legs
and
a
stone
and
a
strap
to
sharpen
my
knife
with
and
there
we
are
shillings
a
week
for
a
chap
an
nipper
ai
so
dusty
farver
is
it
i
thought
it
all
up
and
settled
it
all
out
so
long
as
the
weather
holds
we
sleep
in
the
bed
with
the
green
curtains
and
i
a
green
wood
for
my
workshop
and
when
the
nights
get
cold
we
rent
a
room
of
our
very
own
and
live
like
toffs
wo
us
the
child
eyes
were
shining
with
excitement
my
sam
i
believe
you
work
said
beale
in
tones
of
intense
astonishment
i
like
it
cadgin
said
dickie
they
did
as
dickie
had
said
and
for
two
days
beale
was
content
to
eat
and
doze
and
wake
and
watch
dickie
busy
fingers
and
eat
and
doze
again
but
on
the
third
day
he
announced
that
he
was
getting
the
fidgets
in
his
legs
i
must
do
a
prowl
he
said
i
be
back
afore
sundown
do
you
forget
to
eat
your
dinner
when
the
sun
comes
level
the
top
of
that
high
tree
so
long
matey
beale
slouched
off
in
the
sunshine
in
his
filthy
old
clothes
and
dickie
was
left
to
work
alone
in
the
green
and
golden
wood
it
was
very
still
dickie
hardly
moved
at
all
and
the
chips
that
fell
from
his
work
fell
more
softly
than
the
twigs
and
acorns
that
dropped
now
and
then
from
some
high
bough
a
goldfinch
swung
on
a
swaying
hazel
branch
and
looked
at
him
with
bright
eyes
unafraid
a
grass
snake
slid
swiftly
by
it
was
out
on
particular
business
of
its
own
so
it
was
not
afraid
of
dickie
nor
he
of
it
a
swept
rustling
wings
across
the
glade
where
he
sat
and
once
a
squirrel
ran
right
along
a
bough
to
look
down
at
him
and
chatter
thickening
its
tail
as
a
cat
does
hers
when
she
is
angry
it
was
a
long
and
very
beautiful
day
the
first
that
dickie
had
ever
spent
alone
he
worked
harder
than
ever
and
when
by
the
lessening
light
it
was
impossible
to
work
any
longer
he
lay
back
against
a
tree
root
to
rest
his
tired
back
and
to
gloat
over
the
thought
that
he
had
made
two
boxes
in
one
day
eight
shillings
in
one
single
day
eight
splendid
shillings
the
sun
was
quite
down
before
beale
returned
he
looked
unnaturally
fat
and
as
he
sat
down
on
the
moss
something
inside
the
front
of
his
jacket
moved
and
whined
oh
what
is
it
dickie
asked
sitting
up
alert
in
a
moment
not
a
dawg
oh
farver
you
do
know
how
i
always
wanted
a
dawg
well

yer
want
now
three
times
over
you
said
beale
and
unbuttoning
his
jacket
took
out
a
double
handful
of
soft
fluffy
sprawling
arms
and
legs
and
heads
and
tails
three
little
fat
white
puppies
oh
the
jolly
little
beasts
said
dickie
ai
they
fine
where
did
you
get
them

was

said
beale
his
handkerchief
by
a
lady
in
the
country
he
fixed
his
eyes
on
the
soft
blue
of
the
darkening
sky
try
another
said
dickie
calmly
ah
it
ai
no
use
trying
to
deceive
the
nipper
that
sharp
he
is
said
beale
with
a
mixture
of
pride
and
confusion

beale
eagerly

dickie
well

beale
sheepishly

said
dickie
furious
and
he
flung
the
two
newly
finished
boxes
violently
to
the
ground
and
sat
frowning
with
eyes
downcast
beale
on
all
fours
retrieved
the
boxes
two

said
in
awestruck
tones
there

overtaken
on
the
road

given
him
a
bit
of
blue
ribbon
for

was
a
dinky
darling
and
she
wanted
it
gent
said
he
get
her
plenty
better
no
she
wanted
that
an
she
got
it
too
a
fool
and
his
money
soon
parted
what
i
say
and
one
i
let
go
cheap
for
fourteen
bob
to
a
black
clergyman
black
as
your
hat
he
was
from
foreign
parts
so
now
bloomin
toffs
an
i
get
a
pair
of
this
very
night
and
what
price
that
there
room
you
was
talkin
about
it
was
the
beginning
of
a
new
life
dickie
wrote
out
their
accounts
on
a
large
flagstone
near
the
horse
trough
by
the
chequers
with
a
bit
of
billiard
chalk
that
a
man
gave
him
it
was
like
this
got
box
box
box
box
dog
dog
spent
dogs
grub
tram
leg
and
he
made
out
before
he
rubbed
the
chalk
off
the
stone
that
the
difference
between
shillings
and
seventy
was
about
two
pounds
and
that
was
more
than
dickie
had
ever
had
or
beale
either
for
many
a
long
year
then
beale
came
wiping
his
mouth
and
they
walked
idly
up
the
road
lodgings
or
rather
lodging
a
room
but
when
you
have
had
what
is
called
the
key
of
the
street
for
years
enough
you
hardly
know
where
to
look
for
the
key
of
a
room
where
you
like
to
be
beale
asked
anxiously
you
like
country
best
do
yer
yes
said
dickie
but
in
the
beale
urged
well
town
then
said
dickie
who
was
trying
to
invent
a
box
of
a
new
and
different
shape
to
be
carved
next
day
i
could
keep
a
lookout
for
likely
pups
said
beale
there
a
plenty
here
and
there
all
about
and
you
with
your
boxes
we
might
go
to
three
bob
a
week
for
the
room
i
like
a
with
a
garden
said
dickie
go
back
to
yer
talbots
said
beale
no
but
look
said
dickie
if
we
was
to
take
a
just
a
little
and
let
half
of
it
we
ai
got
no
sticks
to
put
in
it
ai
there
some
way
you
get
furniture
without
payin
for
it
systim
but
that
for
toffs
on
three
quid
a
week
wages
they
would
look
at
us
we
get
three
quid
right
enough
afore
we
done
said
dickie
firmly
and
if
you
want
london
i
like
our
old
house
because
of
the
seeds
i
sowed
in
the
garden
i
lay
they
keep
on
up
forever
and
ever
that
what
annuals
means
the
chap
next
door
told
me
it
means
flowers
as
comes
up
fresh
every
year
let
tramp
up
and
i
show
it
to
you
where
we
used
to
live
and
when
they
had
tramped
up
and
dickie
had
shown
beale
the
little
house
beale
owned
that
it
would
do
a
fair
treat
but
we
must
some
bits
of
sticks
or
else
nobody
wo
let
us
have
no
they
flattened
their
noses
against
the
front
window
the
newspapers
and
dirty
sackings
still
lay
scattered
on
the
floor
as
they
had
fallen
from
dickie
when
he
had
got
up
in
the
morning
after
the
night
when
he
had
had
the
dream
the
sight
pulled
at
dickie
he
felt
as
a
man
might
feel
who
beheld
once
more
the
seaport
from
which
in
old
and
beautiful
days
he
had
set
sail
for
the
shores
of
romance
the
golden
splendor
of
the
fortunate
islands
i
could
doss
again
he
said
wistfully
it
save
fourpence
both
both
sides
is
empty
nobody
would
know
we
do
need
to
look
to
our
fourpences
so
sharp
all
that
said
beale
i
like
to
wonder
you
ai
afeared
i
used
to
it
said
dickie
it
was
our
own
you
see
you
come
along
to
yer
supper
said
beale
do
be
so
flash
with
yer
own
they
had
supper
at
a
in
the
broadway
two
mugs
four
billiard
balls
and
a
dozen
was
beale
order
you
or
i
more
polite
if
less
picturesque
would
perhaps
have
said
two
cups
of
tea
four
eggs
and
some
thick
bread
and
butter
it
was
a
pleasant
meal
only
just
at
the
end
it
turned
into
something
quite
different
the
shop
was
one
of
those
ones
divided
by
partitions
like
the
stalls
in
a
stable
and
over
the
top
of
this
partition
there
suddenly
appeared
a
head
dickie
mug
paused
in
air
to
his
mouth
which
remained
open
what
up
beale
asked
trying
to
turn
on
the
narrow
seat
and
look
up
which
he
could
do
it
whispered
dickie
setting
down
the
mug
that
chap
wot
i
never
see
and
then
the
redheaded
man
came
round
the
partition
and
sat
down
beside
beale
and
talked
to
him
and
dickie
wished
he
would
he
heard
little
of
the
conversation
only
better
luck
next
time
from
the
redheaded
man
and
i
do
know
as
i
taking
any
from
beale
and
at
the
parting
the
redheaded
man
saying
i
doss
same
shop
as
wot
you
do
and
beale
giving
the
name
of
the
where
on
the
way
to
the
beale
had
left
the
perambulator
and
engaged
their
beds
tell
you
all
about
it
in
the
morning
were
the
last
words
of
the
redheaded
one
as
he
slouched
out
and
dickie
and
beale
were
left
to
finish
the
and
drink
the
cold
tea
that
had
slopped
into
their
saucers
when
they
went
out
dickie
said
what
did
he
want
farver
that
redheaded
chap
beale
did
not
at
once
answer

would

dickie

front
of
him

dickie
firmly
and
oh

i
do
so
wanter
sleep
in
that
that
was
where
i
the
dream
you
know
oh
well
come
on
then
said
beale
lucky
we
got
our
thick
coats
on
it
was
quite
easy
for
dickie
to
get
into
the
house
just
as
he
had
done
before
and
to
go
along
the
passage
and
open
the
front
door
for
beale
who
walked
in
as
bold
as
brass
they
made
themselves
comfortable
with
the
sacking
and
old
papers
but
one
at
least
of
the
two
missed
the
luxury
of
clean
air
and
soft
moss
and
a
bed
canopy
strewn
with
stars
beale
was
soon
asleep
and
dickie
lay
still
his
heart
beating
to
the
tune
of
the
hope
that
now
at
last
in
this
place
where
it
had
once
come
his
dream
would
come
again
but
it
did
not
come
even
sleep
plain
restful
dreamless
sleep
would
not
come
to
him
at
last
he
could
lie
still
no
longer
he
slipped
from
under
the
paper
whose
rustling
did
not
disturb
beale
slumbers
and
moved
into
the
square
of
light
thrown
through
the
window
by
the
street
lamp
he
felt
in
his
pockets
pulled
out
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
set
them
on
the
floor
and
moved
by
memories
of
the
great
night
when
his
dream
had
come
to
him
arranged
the
round
them
in
the
same
pattern
that
they
had
lain
in
on
that
night
of
nights
and
the
moment
that
he
had
lain
the
last
seed
completing
the
crossed
triangles
the
magic
began
again
all
was
as
it
had
been
before
the
tired
eyes
that
must
close
the
feeling
that
through
his
closed
eyelids
he
could
yet
see
something
moving
in
the
centre
of
the
star
that
the
two
triangles
made
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
said
the
same
soft
small
voice
that
had
spoken
before
but
this
time
dickie
did
not
reply
that
he
was
not
particular
instead
he
said
oh
i
want
to
go
there
feeling
quite
sure
that
whoever
owned
that
voice
would
know
as
well
as
he
or
even
better
where
there
was
and
how
to
get
to
it
and
as
on
that
other
night
everything
grew
very
quiet
and
sleep
wrapped
dickie
round
like
a
soft
garment
when
he
awoke
he
lay
in
the
big
bed
with
the
green
and
white
curtains
about
him
were
the
tapestry
walls
and
the
heavy
furniture
of
the
dream
oh
he
cried
aloud
i
found
it
again
i
found
it
i
found
it
and
then
the
old
nurse
with
the
hooped
petticoats
and
the
queer
cap
and
the
white
ruff
was
bending
over
him
her
wrinkled
face
was
alight
with
love
and
tenderness
so
awake
at
last
she
said
thou
find
thy
friend
in
thy
dreams
dickie
hugged
her
i
found
the
way
back
he
said
i
do
know
which
is
the
dream
and
which
is
real
but
know
yes
said
the
old
nurse
i
know
the
one
is
as
real
as
the
other
he
sprang
out
of
bed
and
went
leaping
round
the
room
jumping
on
to
chairs
and
off
them
running
and
dancing
what
ails
the
child
the
nurse
grumbled
get
thy
hose
on
for
shame
taking
a
chill
as
like
as
not
what
ails
thee
to
act
so
it
the
not
being
lame
dickie
explained
coming
to
a
standstill
by
the
window
that
looked
out
on
the
good
green
garden
you
do
know
how
wonderful
it
seems
just
at
first
you
know
to
be
lame
chapter
vi
buried
treasure
and
then
as
he
stood
there
in
the
sunshine
he
suddenly
knew
having
succeeded
in
dreaming
once
again
the
dream
which
he
had
so
longed
to
dream
dickie
harding
looked
out
of
the
window
of
the
in
deptford
into
the
with
its
cut
and
box
avenues
and
and
perceived
without
doubt
that
this
was
no
dream
but
real
as
real
as
the
other
deptford
where
he
had
sown
artistic
bird
seed
and
gathered
moonflowers
and
reaped
the
silver
seeds
of
magic
for
it
magic
dickie
was
sure
of
it
now
he
had
not
lived
in
the
time
of
the
first
james
be
sure
without
hearing
magic
talked
of
and
it
seemed
quite
plain
to
him
that
if
this
that
had
happened
to
him
was
not
magic
then
there
never
was
and
never
would
be
any
magic
to
happen
to
any
one
he
turned
from
the
window
and
looked
at
the
room
the
big
bed
the
pleasant
wrinkled
face
of
the
nurse
and
he
knew
that
all
this
was
as
real
as
anything
that
had
happened
to
him
in
that
other
life
where
he
was
a
little
lame
boy
who
took
the
road
with
a
dirty
tramp
for
father
and
lay
in
the
bed
with
green
curtains
was
thy
friend
well
in
thy
dream
the
nurse
asked
yes
oh
yes
said
dickie
and
i
carved
boxes
in
my
dream
and
sold
them
and
i
want
to
learn
a
lot
more
things
so
that
when
i
go
back
again
i
mean
when
i
dream
that
dream
again
i
shall
be
able
to
earn
more
money
is
shame
that
one
of
thy
name
should
have
to
work
for
money
said
the
nurse
it
my
name
there
said
dickie
and
old
sebastian
told
me
every
one
ought
to
do
some
duty
to
his
country
or
he
was
worth
his
meat
and
ale
and
you
do
know
how
good
it
is
having
money
that
i
ought
to
she
said
i
earned
mine
long
enough
now
haste
and
dress
and
then
breakfast
and
thy
fencing
lesson
when
the
fencing
lesson
was
over
dickie
hesitated
he
wanted
of
course
to
hurry
off
to
sebastian
and
to
go
on
learning
how
to
make
a
galleon
but
also
he
wanted
to
learn
some
trade
that
he
could
teach
beale
at
deptford
and
he
knew
quite
as
surely
as
any
master
craftsman
could
have
known
it
that
nothing
which
required
delicate
handling
such
as
or
the
making
of
toy
boats
could
ever
be
mastered
by
beale
but
beale
was
certainly
fond
of
dogs
dickie
remembered
how
little
true
had
cuddled
up
to
him
and
nestled
inside
his
coat
when
he
lay
down
to
sleep
under
the
newspapers
and
the
bits
of
sacking
in
lavender
terrace
rosemary
lane
so
dickie
went
his
way
to
the
kennels
to
talk
to
the
kennelman
he
had
been
there
before
with
master
roger
fry
his
fencing
master
but
he
had
never
spoken
to
the
kennelman
and
when
he
got
to
the
kennels
he
knocked
on
the
door
of
the
kennelman
house
and
called
out
what
ho
within
there
just
as
people
do
in
old
plays
and
the
door
was
thrown
open
by
a
man
in
a
complete
suit
of
leather
and
when
dickie
looked
in
that
man
face
he
saw
that
it
was
the
face
of
the
man
who
had
lived
next
door
in
lavender
terrace
rosemary
lane
the
man
who
dug
up
the
garden
for
the
parrot
seed
why
said
dickie
it
you
who
would
it
be
but
me
little
master
the
man
asked
with
a
respectful
salute
and
dickie
perceived
that
though
this
man
had
the
face
of
the
man
next
door
he
had
not
the
man
next
door
memories
do
you
live
here
he
asked
cautiously
always
i
mean
where
else
should
i
live
the
man
asked
that
have
served
my
lord
your
father
all
my
time
boy
and
man
and
know
every
hair
of
every
dog
my
lord
owns
dickie
thought
that
was
a
good
deal
to
know
and
so
it
was
he
stayed
an
hour
at
the
kennels
and
came
away
knowing
very
much
more
about
dogs
than
he
did
before
though
some
of
the
things
he
learned
would
surprise
a
modern
veterinary
surgeon
very
much
indeed
but
the
dogs
seemed
well
and
happy
though
they
were
doctored
with
herb
tea
instead
of
stuff
from
the
chemist
and
the
charms
that
were
said
over
them
to
make
them
swift
and
strong
certainly
did
not
make
them
any
the
less
strong
and
swift
when
dickie
had
learned
as
much
about
dogs
as
he
felt
he
could
bear
for
that
day
he
felt
free
to
go
down
to
the
dockyard
and
go
on
learning
how
ships
were
built
sebastian
looked
up
at
the
voice
and
ceased
the
blows
with
which
his
axe
was
smoothing
a
great
tree
trunk
that
was
to
be
a
mast
and
smiled
in
answer
to
his
smile
oh
what
a
long
time
since
i
have
seen
thee
dickie
cried
and
sebastian
gently
mocking
him
answered
a
great
while
indeed
two
whole
long
days
and
those
spent
merrymaking
in
the
king
water
pageant
two
days
a
great
while
a
great
great
while
i
want
you
to
teach
me
everything
you
know
said
dickie
picking
up
an
awl
and
feeling
its
point
illustration
what
a
long
time
since
i
have
seen
thee
dickie
cried
have
patience
with
me
laughed
sebastian
i
will
teach
thee
all
thou
canst
learn
but
not
all
in
one
while
little
by
little
slow
and
sure
you
must
not
think
said
dickie
that
it
only
play
and
that
i
do
not
need
to
learn
because
i
am
my
father
son
should
i
think
so
sebastian
asked
i
that
have
sailed
with
captain
drake
and
captain
raleigh
and
seen
how
a
gentleman
venturer
needs
to
turn
his
hand
to
every
guess
craft
if
thou
so
pleased
to
learn
as
sebastian
is
to
teach
then
he
be
as
quick
to
teach
as
thou
to
learn
and
so
to
work
he
fetched
out
from
the
shed
the
ribs
of
the
little
galleon
that
he
and
dickie
had
begun
to
put
together
and
the
two
set
to
work
on
it
it
was
a
happy
day
and
one
happiness
was
to
all
the
other
happinesses
of
that
day
as
the
sun
is
to
little
stars
and
that
happiness
was
the
happiness
of
being
once
more
a
little
boy
who
did
not
need
to
use
a
crutch
and
now
the
beautiful
spacious
life
opened
once
more
for
dickie
and
he
learned
many
things
and
found
the
days
all
good
and
happy
and
all
the
nights
white
and
peaceful
in
the
big
house
and
the
beautiful
garden
on
the
slopes
above
deptford
and
the
nights
had
no
dreams
in
them
and
in
the
days
dickie
lived
gaily
and
worthily
the
life
of
the
son
of
a
great
and
noble
house
and
now
he
had
no
prickings
of
conscience
about
beale
left
alone
in
the
little
house
in
deptford
because
one
day
he
said
to
his
nurse
how
long
did
it
take
me
to
dream
that
dream
about
making
the
boxes
and
earning
the
money
in
the
ugly
place
i
told
you
of
dreams
about
that
place
she
answered
him
take
none
of
time
here
and
dreams
about
this
place
take
none
of
what
is
time
in
that
other
place
but
my
dream
endured
all
night
objected
dickie
not
so
said
the
nurse
smiling
between
her
white
cap
frills
it
was
the
dream
that
sleep
came
a
whole
good
nightful
of
it
so
dickie
felt
that
for
beale
no
time
at
all
had
passed
and
that
when
he
went
back
which
he
meant
to
do
he
would
get
back
to
deptford
at
the
same
instant
as
he
left
it
which
is
the
essence
of
this
particular
kind
of
white
magic
and
thus
it
happened
that
when
he
did
go
back
to
beale
he
went
because
his
heart
called
him
and
not
for
any
other
reason
at
all
days
and
weeks
and
months
went
by
and
it
was
autumn
and
the
apples
were
ripe
on
the
trees
and
the
grapes
ripe
on
the
garden
walls
and
trellises
and
then
came
a
day
when
all
the
servants
seemed
suddenly
to
go
mad
a
great
rushing
madness
of
mops
and
brooms
and
dusters
and
pails
and
everything
in
the
house
already
perfectly
clean
was
cleaned
anew
and
everything
that
was
already
polished
was
polished
freshly
and
when
dickie
had
been
turned
out
of
three
rooms
one
after
the
other
had
tumbled
over
a
pail
and
had
a
pinned
to
his
doublet
by
an
angry
cook
he
sought
out
the
nurse
very
busy
in
the
and
asked
her
what
all
the
fuss
was
about
it
ca
be
a
he
said
because
it
the
wrong
time
of
year
never
say
i
did
not
tell
thee
she
answered
unfolding
a
great
embroidered
cupboard
cloth
and
holding
it
up
critically
thy
father
and
mother
come
home
and
thy
and
sennight
thy
little
cousins
come
to
visit
thee
how
perfectly
glorious
said
dickie
but
you
tell
me
if
i
did
was
because
you
never
asked
i
i
did
dare
to
he
said
dreamily
i
was
so
afraid
you
see
never
seen
them
afraid
she
said
laying
away
the
folded
cloth
and
taking
out
another
from
the
deep
press
oaken
with
brown
iron
hinges
and
lock
never
seen
thy
father
and
mother
forsooth
perhaps
it
was
the
fever
said
dickie
feeling
rather
deceitful
you
said
it
made
me
forget
things
i
do
remember
them
not
at
all
i
do
do
not
say
that
to
them
the
nurse
said
looking
at
him
very
gravely
i
wo
unless
they
ask
me
he
added
oh
nurse
let
me
do
something
too
what
can
i
do
to
help
thou
canst
gather
such
flowers
as
are
left
in
the
garden
to
make
a
nosegay
for
thy
mother
room
and
set
them
in
order
in
fair
water
and
bid
thy
tutor
teach
thee
a
welcome
song
to
say
to
them
when
they
come
in
gathering
the
flowers
and
arranging
them
was
pleasant
and
easy
asking
so
intimate
a
favor
from
the
tutor
whom
he
so
much
disliked
was
neither
easy
nor
pleasant
but
dickie
did
it
and
the
tutor
was
delighted
to
set
him
to
learn
a
particularly
hard
and
uninteresting
piece
of
poetry
beginning
happy
is
he
who
to
sweet
home
retired
shuns
glory
so
admired
and
to
himself
lives
free
while
he
who
strives
with
pride
to
climb
the
skies
falls
down
with
foul
disgrace
before
he
dies
dickie
could
not
help
thinking
that
the
father
and
mother
who
were
to
be
his
in
this
beautiful
world
might
have
preferred
something
simpler
and
more
affectionate
from
their
little
boy
than
this
difficult
piece
whose
last
verse
was
the
only
one
which
seemed
to
dickie
to
mean
anything
in
particular
in
this
verse
dickie
was
made
to
remark
that
he
hoped
people
would
say
of
him
he
died
a
good
old
man
which
he
did
hope
and
indeed
had
never
so
much
as
thought
of
the
poetry
he
decided
would
have
been
nicer
if
it
had
been
more
about
his
father
and
mother
and
less
about
fame
and
trees
and
burdens
he
felt
this
so
much
that
he
tried
to
write
a
poem
himself
and
got
as
far
as
they
say
there
is
no
other
can
take
the
place
of
mother
i
say
there
is
no
one
i
rather
see
than
my
father
but
he
could
not
think
of
any
more
to
say
and
besides
he
had
a
haunting
idea
that
the
first
two
lines
which
were
quite
the
best
were
not
his
own
so
he
abandoned
the
writing
of
poetry
deciding
that
it
was
not
his
line
and
painfully
learned
the
dismal
verses
appointed
by
his
tutor
but
he
never
got
them
said
when
the
bustle
of
arrival
had
calmed
a
little
dickie
his
heart
beating
very
fast
indeed
found
himself
led
by
his
tutor
into
the
presence
of
the
finest
gentleman
and
the
dearest
lady
he
had
ever
beheld
the
tutor
gave
him
a
little
push
so
that
he
had
to
go
forward
two
steps
and
to
stand
alone
on
the
best
carpet
which
had
been
spread
in
their
honor
and
hissed
in
a
savage
whisper
recite
your
song
of
welcome
the
man
began
dickie
in
tones
of
gloom
and
tremblingly
pronounced
the
first
lines
of
that
unpleasing
poem
but
he
had
not
got
to
strive
with
pride
before
the
dear
lady
caught
him
in
her
arms
exclaiming
bless
my
dear
son
how
he
has
grown
and
the
fine
gentleman
thumped
him
on
the
back
and
bade
him
bear
himself
like
a
gentleman
son
and
not
like
a
queasy
and
they
both
laughed
and
he
cried
a
little
and
the
tutor
seemed
to
be
blotted
out
and
there
they
were
all
three
as
jolly
as
if
they
had
known
each
other
all
their
lives
and
a
stout
young
nurse
brought
the
baby
and
dickie
loved
it
and
felt
certain
it
loved
him
though
it
only
said
goo
ga
goo
exactly
as
your
does
now
and
got
hold
of
hair
and
pulled
it
and
would
not
let
go
there
was
a
glorious
dinner
and
dickie
waited
on
this
new
father
of
his
changed
his
plate
and
poured
wine
out
of
a
silver
jug
into
the
silver
cup
that
my
lord
drank
from
and
after
dinner
the
dear
must
go
all
over
the
house
to
see
everything
because
she
had
been
so
long
away
and
dickie
walked
in
the
garden
among
the
ripe
apples
and
grapes
with
his
father
hand
on
his
shoulder
the
happiest
proudest
boy
in
all
deptford
or
in
all
kent
either
his
father
asked
what
he
had
learned
and
dickie
told
dwelling
perhaps
more
on
the
riding
and
the
fencing
and
the
bowls
and
the
music
than
on
the
tutor
side
of
the
business
but
i
learned
a
lot
of
greek
and
latin
too
he
added
in
a
hurry
and
poetry
and
things
like
that
i
fear
said
the
father
thou
dost
not
love
thy
book
i
do
sir
yet
i
love
my
sports
better
said
dickie
and
looked
up
to
meet
the
fond
proud
look
of
eyes
as
blue
as
his
own
a
good
modest
lad
said
his
father
when
they
began
their
third
round
of
the
garden
not
once
to
ask
for
what
i
promised
thee
dickie
could
not
stand
this
i
might
have
asked
he
said
presently
but
i
have
forgot
what
the
promise
was
the
fever
ay
ay
poor
lad
and
of
a
high
truth
too
owned
he
had
forgot
come
jog
that
poor
peaked
remembrance
dickie
could
hardly
believe
the
beautiful
hope
that
whispered
in
his
ear
i
almost
think
i
remember
he
said
father
did
you
promise
i
promised
if
thou
wast
a
good
lad
and
biddable
and
constant
at
thy
book
and
thy
manly
exercises
to
give
thee
so
soon
as
thou
have
learned
to
ride
him
a
little
horse
said
dickie
breathlessly
oh
father
not
a
little
horse
it
was
good
to
hear
one
father
laugh
that
big
jolly
laugh
to
feel
one
father
arm
laid
like
that
across
one
shoulders
the
little
horse
turned
round
to
look
at
them
from
his
stall
in
the
big
stables
it
was
really
rather
a
big
horse
what
colored
horse
would
you
choose
if
a
horse
were
to
be
yours
for
the
choosing
dickie
would
have
chosen
a
gray
and
a
gray
it
was
what
is
his
name
dickie
asked
when
he
had
admired
the
gray
every
point
had
had
him
saddled
and
had
ridden
him
proudly
round
the
pasture
in
his
father
sight
we
call
him
rosinante
said
his
father
because
he
is
so
fat
and
he
laughed
but
dickie
did
not
understand
the
joke
he
had
not
read
don
quixote
as
you
no
doubt
have
i
should
like
said
dickie
sitting
square
on
the
gray
to
call
him
crutch
may
i
the
father
repeated
because
his
paces
are
so
easy
dickie
explained
he
got
off
the
horse
very
quickly
and
came
to
his
father
i
mean
even
a
lame
boy
could
ride
him
oh
father
i
am
so
happy
he
said
and
burrowed
his
nose
in
a
velvet
doublet
and
perhaps
snivelled
a
little
i
am
so
glad
i
am
not
lame
as
ever
said
his
father
come
come
weak
yet
from
the
fever
be
a
man
remember
of
what
blood
thou
art
and
thy
mother
she
also
hath
a
gift
for
thee
from
thy
grandfather
hast
thou
forgotten
that
it
hangs
to
the
book
learning
a
reward
and
thou
hast
earned
it
i
forgotten
that
too
said
dickie
you
are
vexed
because
i
forget
i
ca
help
it
father
that
i
warrant
thou
can
not
come
now
to
thy
mother
my
little
son
the
earl
of
scilly
chid
me
but
this
summer
for
sparing
the
rod
and
spoiling
the
child
but
thy
growth
in
all
things
bears
out
in
what
i
answered
him
i
said
boys
of
our
house
my
lord
take
that
pride
in
it
that
they
learn
of
their
own
free
will
what
many
an
earl
son
must
be
driven
to
with
rods
he
took
me
his
own
son
is
little
better
than
an
idiot
and
naught
but
the
rod
to
blame
for
it
i
verily
believe
they
found
the
and
her
babe
by
a
little
fire
in
a
wide
hearth
our
son
comes
to
claim
the
guerdon
of
learning
the
father
said
and
the
lady
stood
up
with
the
babe
in
her
arms
call
the
nurse
to
take
him
she
said
but
dickie
held
out
his
arms
oh
mother
he
said
and
it
was
the
first
time
in
all
his
life
that
he
had
spoken
that
word
to
any
one
mother
do
let
me
hold
him
a
warm
stiff
bundle
was
put
into
his
careful
arms
and
his
little
brother
instantly
caught
at
his
hair
it
hurt
but
dickie
liked
it
the
lady
went
to
one
of
the
carved
cabinets
and
with
a
bright
key
from
a
very
bright
bunch
unlocked
one
of
the
heavy
panelled
doors
she
drew
out
of
the
darkness
within
a
leather
bag
embroidered
in
gold
thread
and
crimson
silk
he
has
forgot
said
sir
richard
in
an
undertone
what
it
was
that
the
grandfather
promised
him
though
he
has
well
earned
the
same
is
the
fever
the
mother
put
the
bag
in
dickie
hands
count
it
out
she
said
taking
her
babe
from
him
and
dickie
untied
the
leathern
string
and
poured
out
on
to
the
polished
long
table
what
the
bag
held
twenty
gold
pieces
and
all
with
the
image
of
our
late
dear
queen
said
the
mother
the
image
of
that
incomparable
virgin
majesty
whose
example
is
a
beacon
for
all
time
to
all
virtuous
ladies
illustration
it
hurt
but
dickie
liked
it
ah
yes
indeed
said
the
father
put
them
up
in
the
bag
boy
they
are
thine
own
to
thee
to
spend
as
thou
wilt
not
unwisely
said
the
mother
gently
as
he
wills
the
father
firmly
said
wisely
or
unwisely
as
he
wills
and
none
he
added
shall
ask
how
they
be
spent
the
lady
frowned
she
was
a
careful
housewife
and
twenty
gold
pieces
were
a
large
sum
i
will
not
waste
it
said
dickie
mother
you
may
trust
me
not
to
waste
it
it
was
the
happiest
moment
of
his
life
to
dickie
the
little
horse
the
gold
pieces
yes
but
much
more
the
sudden
good
safe
feeling
of
father
and
mother
and
little
brother
of
a
place
where
he
belonged
where
he
loved
and
was
loved
and
by
his
equals
for
he
felt
that
as
far
as
a
child
can
be
the
equal
of
grown
people
he
was
the
equal
of
these
and
beale
was
not
his
equal
either
in
the
graces
of
the
body
or
in
the
inner
treasures
of
mind
and
heart
and
hitherto
he
had
loved
only
beale
had
only
so
far
as
he
could
remember
been
loved
by
beale
and
by
that
shadowy
father
his
daddy
who
had
died
in
hospital
and
dying
had
given
him
the
rattle
his
tinkler
that
was
harding
luck
and
in
the
very
heart
of
that
happiest
moment
came
like
a
sharp
dagger
prick
the
thought
of
beale
what
wonders
could
be
done
for
beale
with
those
gold
sovereigns
for
dickie
thought
of
them
just
as
sovereigns
and
so
they
were
and
as
these
people
who
loved
him
who
were
his
own
drew
nearer
and
nearer
to
his
heart
his
heart
quickened
by
love
of
them
felt
itself
drawn
more
and
more
to
beale
beale
the
tramp
who
had
been
kind
to
him
when
no
one
else
was
beale
the
tramp
and
housebreaker
so
when
the
nurse
took
him
tired
with
new
happinesses
to
that
beautiful
tapestried
room
of
his
he
roused
himself
from
his
good
soft
sleepiness
to
say
nurse
you
know
a
lot
of
things
do
you
i
know
what
i
know
she
answered
undoing
buttons
with
speed
and
authority
you
know
that
other
dream
of
mine
that
dream
of
mine
i
mean
the
dream
of
a
dreadful
place
and
then
could
i
take
anything
out
of
this
dream
i
mean
out
of
this
time
into
the
other
one
you
could
but
you
must
bring
it
back
when
you
come
again
and
you
could
bring
things
thence
certain
things
your
rattle
your
your
seal
he
stared
at
her
you
know
things
he
said
but
i
want
to
take
things
there
and
leave
them
there
she
knitted
thoughtful
brows
there
three
hundred
thick
years
between
now
and
then
she
said
oh
yes
i
know
and
if
you
held
it
in
your
hand
you
lose
it
like
as
not
in
some
of
the
years
you
go
through
money
mortal
heavy
and
travels
slow
slower
than
the
soul
of
you
my
lamb
some
one
would
have
time
to
see
it
and
snatch
it
and
hold
to
it
is
there
any
way
dickie
asked
insisting
to
himself
that
he
sleepy
there
the
way
of
everything
the
earth
she
said
bury
it
and
lie
down
on
the
spot
where
it
buried
and
then
when
you
get
back
into
the
other
dream
the
kind
thick
earth
will
have
hid
your
secret
and
you
can
dig
it
up
again
it
will
be
there
unless
other
hands
have
dug
there
in
the
three
hundred
years
you
must
take
your
chance
of
that
will
you
help
me
dickie
asked
i
shall
need
to
dig
it
very
deep
if
i
am
to
cheat
three
hundred
years
and
suppose
he
added
struck
by
a
sudden
and
unpleasing
thought
there
a
house
built
on
the
place
i
should
be
mixed
up
with
the
house
two
things
ca
be
in
the
same
place
at
the
same
time
my
tutor
told
me
that
and
the
house
would
be
so
much
stronger
than
me
it
would
get
the
best
of
it
and
where
should
i
be
then
i
ask
where
thou
be
was
the
very
surprising
answer
i
ask
some
one
who
knows
but
it
take
time
put
thy
money
in
the
great
press
and
i
keep
the
key
and
next
friday
as
ever
is
come
your
little
cousins
they
came
it
was
more
difficult
with
them
than
it
was
with
the
to
conceal
the
fact
that
he
had
not
always
been
the
dickie
he
was
now
but
it
was
not
so
difficult
as
you
might
suppose
it
was
no
harder
than
not
talking
about
the
dreams
you
had
last
night
and
now
he
had
indeed
a
full
life
bodily
exercises
work
home
life
and
joyous
hours
of
play
with
two
children
who
understood
play
as
the
poor
little
dirty
deptford
children
do
not
and
can
not
understand
it
he
lived
and
learned
and
felt
more
and
more
that
this
was
the
life
to
which
he
really
belonged
and
days
and
weeks
and
months
went
by
and
nothing
happened
and
that
is
the
happiest
thing
that
can
happen
to
any
one
who
is
already
happy
then
one
night
the
nurse
said
i
have
asked
you
are
to
bury
your
treasure
under
the
window
of
the
solar
parlor
and
lie
down
and
sleep
on
it
you
take
no
harm
and
when
you
asleep
i
will
say
the
right
words
and
you
wake
under
the
same
skies
and
not
under
a
built
house
like
as
you
feared
she
wrapped
him
in
a
warm
cloth
mantle
of
her
own
when
she
took
him
from
his
bed
that
night
after
all
the
family
were
asleep
and
put
on
his
shoes
and
led
him
to
the
hole
she
had
secretly
dug
in
below
the
window
they
had
put
his
embroidered
leather
bag
of
gold
in
a
little
coffer
that
sebastian
had
given
him
and
the
nurse
had
tightly
fastened
the
join
of
lid
and
box
with
wax
and
resin
the
box
was
wrapped
in
a
silk
scarf
and
the
whole
packet
put
into
a
big
earthenware
jar
with
a
lid
and
the
join
of
lid
and
jar
was
smeared
with
resin
and
covered
with
clay
the
nurse
had
shown
him
how
to
do
all
this
against
the
earth
spirits
and
the
three
hundred
years
she
said
now
she
lifted
the
jar
into
the
hole
and
together
they
filled
the
hole
with
earth
treading
it
in
with
their
feet
and
when
you
would
return
said
the
nurse
you
know
the
way
do
i
you
lay
the
rattle
the
seal
and
the
as
before
and
listen
to
the
voices
and
then
dickie
lay
down
in
the
cloth
cloak
and
the
nurse
sat
by
him
and
held
his
hand
till
he
fell
asleep
it
was
june
now
and
the
scent
of
the
roses
was
very
sweet
and
the
nightingales
kept
him
awake
awhile
but
the
sky
overhead
was
an
old
friend
of
his
and
as
he
lay
he
could
see
the
shining
of
the
dew
among
the
grass
blades
of
the
lawn
it
was
pleasant
to
lie
again
in
the
bed
with
the
green
curtains
when
he
awoke
there
was
his
old
friend
the
starry
sky
and
for
a
moment
he
wondered
then
he
remembered
he
raised
himself
on
his
elbow
there
were
houses
all
about
little
houses
with
lights
in
some
of
the
windows
a
broken
paling
was
quite
close
to
him
there
was
no
grass
near
only
rough
trampled
earth
the
smell
all
about
him
was
not
of
roses
but
of
and
there
were
no
nightingales
but
far
away
he
could
hear
that
restless
roar
that
is
the
voice
of
london
and
near
at
hand
the
foolish
song
and
unsteady
footfall
of
a
man
going
home
from
the
cat
and
whistle
he
scratched
a
cross
on
the
hard
ground
with
a
broken
bit
of
a
plate
to
mark
the
spot
got
up
and
crept
on
hands
and
knees
to
the
house
climbed
in
and
found
the
room
where
beale
lay
asleep
father
said
dickie
next
morning
as
beale
stretched
and
grunted
and
rubbed
sleepy
eyes
with
his
unwashed
fists
in
the
cold
daylight
that
filled
the
front
room
of
lavender
terrace
rosemary
lane
you
got
to
take
this
house
that
what
you
got
to
do
you
remember
ca
say
i
do
said
beale
scratching
his
head
but
if
the
nipper
says
so
it
so
let
go
and
get
a
mug
and
a
and
then
we
see
you
get
it
if
you
hungry
said
dickie
i
rather
wait
here
in
case
anybody
else
was
to
take
the
house
you
go
and
see
now
think
you
a
man
in
work
by
your
being
up
so
early
said
beale
thoughtfully
running
his
hand
over
the
rustling
stubble
of
his
two
days
beard
i
best
get
a
wash
and
first
eh
it
might
be
worth
it
in
the
end
i
to
go
to
the
doss
to
get
our
pram
and
things
the
landlord
of
the
desired
house
really
thought
beale
a
quite
respectable
working
man
and
beale
accounted
for
their
lack
of
furniture
by
saying
quite
truthfully
that
he
and
his
nipper
had
come
up
from
gravesend
doing
a
bit
of
work
on
the
way
i
could
he
added
quite
untruthfully
give
you
the
gentleman
i
worked
with
for
me
reference
talbott
name
is
a
bald
man
with
a
squint
and
red
ears
but
this
do
as
well
he
pulled
out
of
one
pocket
all
their
money
two
pounds
eighteen
shillings
except
six
pennies
which
he
had
put
in
the
other
pocket
to
rattle
he
rattled
them
now
i
anxious
he
said
confidentially
to
get
settled
on
account
of
the
nipper
i
do
deceive
you
we
it
up
not
to
waste
our
little
bit
and
he
a
hoppy
chap
that
odd
said
the
landlord
there
was
a
lame
boy
lived
there
along
of
the
last
party
that
had
it
it
a
cripple
home
by
rights
i
should
think
beale
had
not
foreseen
this
difficulty
and
had
no
story
ready
so
he
tried
the
truth
it
the
same
lad
mister
he
said
that
why
i
rather
set
on
the
you
see
it
to
like
he
added
sentimentally
you
father
said
the
landlord
sharply
and
again
beale
was
inspired
to
truthfulness
quite
a
lot
of
it
no
he
said
cautiously
wish
i
was
the
fact
is
the
little
aunt
was
much
class
an
i
found
wandering
an
not
none
of
my
own
i
sort
of
adopted
like
wandering
hares
at
the
theatre
said
the
landlord
who
had
been
told
by
dickie
aunt
that
the
ungrateful
little
warmint
had
run
away
i
see
and
a
jolly
little
chap
said
beale
warming
to
his
subject
and
forgetting
his
caution
as
knowing
as
a
and
his
patter
enough
to
make
a
cat
laugh
is
sometimes
and
i
pay
a
week
down
if
you
like
mister
and
we
get
our
bits
of
sticks
in
well
said
the
landlord
taking
a
key
from
a
nail
on
the
wall
go
down
and
have
a
look
at
the
where
the
kid
there
awaitin
for
me
said
beale
could
get
away
dickie
was
very
polite
to
the
landlord
at
whom
in
unhappier
days
he
had
sometimes
made
faces
and
when
the
landlord
went
he
had
six
of
their
shillings
and
they
had
the
key
so
now
we
got
a
of
our
own
said
beale
rubbing
his
hands
when
they
had
gone
through
the
house
together
an
englishman
is
castle
and
what
with
the
boxes
you
cut
out
and
the
dogs
what
pick
up
buckingham
palace
look
small
alongside
of
us
eh
matey
they
locked
up
the
house
and
went
to
breakfast
beale
gay
as
a
lark
and
dickie
rather
silent
he
was
thinking
over
a
new
difficulty
it
was
all
very
well
to
bury
twenty
sovereigns
and
to
know
exactly
where
they
were
and
they
were
his
own
beyond
a
doubt
but
if
any
one
saw
those
sovereigns
dug
up
those
sovereigns
would
be
taken
away
from
him
no
one
would
believe
that
they
were
his
own
and
the
earthenware
pot
was
so
big
and
so
many
windows
looked
out
on
the
garden
no
one
could
hope
to
dig
up
a
big
thing
like
that
from
his
back
garden
without
attracting
attention
besides
he
doubted
whether
he
were
strong
enough
to
dig
it
up
even
if
he
could
do
so
unobserved
he
had
not
thought
of
this
when
he
had
put
the
gold
there
in
that
other
life
he
was
so
much
stronger
then
he
sighed
got
the
mate
asked
beale
with
his
mouth
full
no
i
was
just
we
best
buy
the
sticks
first
thing
said
beale
it
a
cruel
world
sticks
no
trust
is
the
landlord
motto
do
you
want
to
know
what
sticks
they
bought
i
will
tell
you
they
bought
a
rusty
old
bedstead
very
big
with
laths
that
hung
loose
like
a
hammock
and
all
its
knobs
gone
and
only
bare
screws
sticking
up
spikily
also
a
flock
mattress
and
pillows
of
a
dull
dust
color
to
go
on
the
bed
and
some
blankets
and
sheets
all
matching
the
mattress
to
a
shade
they
bought
a
table
and
two
chairs
and
a
kitchen
fender
with
a
round
steel
moon
only
it
was
very
rusty
and
a
for
the
sink
and
a
small
zinc
bath
to
wash
your
shirt
in
said
beale
four
plates
two
cups
and
saucers
two
each
of
knives
forks
and
spoons
a
tin
teapot
a
quart
jug
a
pail
a
bit
of
kidderminster
carpet
half
a
pound
of
yellow
soap
a
and
broom
two
towels
a
kettle
a
saucepan
and
a
and
a
pint
of
paraffin
also
there
was
a
tin
lamp
to
hang
on
the
wall
with
a
dazzling
crinkled
tin
reflector
this
was
the
only
thing
that
was
new
and
it
cost
tenpence
halfpenny
all
the
rest
of
the
things
together
cost
shillings
and
sevenpence
halfpenny
and
i
think
they
were
cheap
but
they
seemed
very
poor
and
very
little
of
them
when
they
were
dumped
down
in
the
front
room
the
bed
especially
looked
far
from
its
best
a
mere
heap
of
loose
iron
and
we
ai
got
our
suit
neither
said
beale
lady
and
gent
four
hoccasionals
pianner
and
foomed
oak

old
shirt
of
mine

with
that
you
do
give
your
orders
neither
said
beale
contentedly
the
curtains
and
a
of
tacks
a
hammer
borrowed
from
a
neighbor
and
an
hour
cheerful
work
completed
the
fortification
of
the
englishman
house
against
the
inquisitiveness
of
but
the
landlord
frowned
anxiously
as
he
went
past
the
house
do
like
all
that
white
curtain
he
told
himself
not
much
it
if
you
ask
me
people
do
go
to
that
extreme
in
nottingham
lace
without
there
something
to
hide
a
house
full
of
emptiness
most
likely
inside
dickie
was
telling
a
very
astonished
beale
that
there
was
money
buried
in
the
garden
it
was
give
me
said
he
for
learning
of
something
and
we
got
to
get
it
up
so
as
no
one
sees
us
i
ca
think
of
nothing
but
build
a
and
then
dig
inside
of
it
i
wish
i
was
cleverer
here
ward
would
have
thought
of
something
first
go
off
do
you
worry
said
beale
you
clever
enough
for
this
poor
world
all
right
come
on
out
and
show
us
where
you
put
it
just
peg
with
yer
foot
on
the
spot
looking
up
careless
at
the
sky
they
went
out
and
dickie
put
his
foot
on
the
cross
he
had
scratched
with
the
broken
bit
of
plate
it
was
close
to
the
withered
stalk
of
the
moonflower
this
garden
in
a
poor
state
said
beale
in
a
loud
voice
wants
turning
over
what
think
against
the
winter
i
get
a
spade
and
a
turn
at
it
this
very
day
so
i
will
this
old
got
some
roots
i
lay
the
digging
began
at
the
fence
and
reached
the
moonflower
whose
roots
were
indeed
deep
quite
a
hole
beale
dug
before
the
tall
stalk
sloped
and
fell
with
slow
dignity
like
a
forest
tree
before
the
axe
then
the
man
and
the
child
went
in
and
brought
out
the
kitchen
table
and
chairs
and
laid
blankets
over
them
to
air
in
the
autumn
sunlight
dickie
played
at
houses
under
the
table
it
was
not
the
sort
of
game
he
usually
played
but
the
neighbors
could
not
know
that
the
table
happened
to
be
set
down
just
over
the
hole
that
had
held
the
roots
of
the
moonflower
dickie
dug
a
little
with
a
trowel
in
the
blanket
house
after
dark
they
carried
the
blankets
and
things
in
then
one
of
the
blankets
was
nailed
up
over
the
window
and
on
the
iron
bedstead
dingy
mattress
the
resin
was
melted
from
the
lid
of
the
pot
that
beale
had
brought
in
with
the
other
things
from
the
garden
also
it
was
melted
from
the
crack
of
the
iron
casket
beale
eyes
always
rather
prominent
almost
resembled
the
eyes
of
the
lobster
or
the
snail
as
their
gaze
fell
on
the
embroidered
leather
bag
and
when
dickie
opened
this
and
showered
the
twenty
gold
coins
into
a
hollow
of
the
drab
ticking
he
closed
his
eyes
and
sighed
and
opened
them
again
and
said
you
they
give
you
that
i
do
believe
you
you
got
to
believe
me
said
dickie
firmly
i

i
come
to
think
of
it
i
do

and
fondly

redheaded

beale
when

bit
of
paper
and
pencil
there
you
ai
done
me
no
anyway
said
dickie
no
i
know
i
ai
why
i
took
to
you
the
very
first
day
i
allus
been
kind
to
you
you
ca
say
i
ai
beale
was
confused
by
the
two
desires
which
make
it
difficult
to
confess
anything
truthfully
the
desire
to
tell
the
worst
of
oneself
and
the
desire
to
do
full
justice
to
oneself
at
the
same
time
it
is
so
very
hard
not
to
blacken
the
blackness
or
whiten
the
whiteness
when
one
comes
to
trying
to
tell
the
truth
about
oneself
but
i
been
a
beast
all
the
same
said
beale
helplessly
oh
stow
it
dickie
said
now
you
told
me
it
all
square
you
wo
keep
a
down
on
me
for
it
now
should
i
said
dickie
exasperated
and
very
sleepy
now
all
is
open
as
the
day
and
we
can
pursue
our
career
as
honorable
men
and
comrades
in
all
high
emprise
i
mean
he
explained
noticing
beale
open
mouth
and
eyes
more
than
ever
i
mean
all
right
farver
and
you
see
it
do
make
any
difference
to
me
i
knows
you
straight
now
even
if
it
did
begin
just
like
that
get
to
bed
sha
us
beale
dreamed
that
he
was
trying
to
drown
dickie
in
a
pond
full
of
stewed
eels
dickie
did
dream
at
all
you
may
wonder
why
since
going
to
the
beautiful
other
world
took
no
time
and
was
so
easy
dickie
did
not
do
it
every
night
or
even
at
odd
times
during
the
day
well
the
fact
was
he
dared
not
he
loved
the
other
life
so
much
that
he
feared
that
once
again
there
he
might
not
have
the
courage
to
return
to
beale
and
deptford
and
the
feel
of
dirty
clothes
and
the
smell
of
it
was
no
light
thing
to
come
back
from
that
to
this
and
now
he
made
a
resolution
that
he
would
not
set
out
the
charm
of
tinkler
and
seal
and
until
he
had
established
beale
in
an
honorable
calling
and
made
a
life
for
him
in
which
he
could
be
happy
a
great
undertaking
for
a
child
yes
but
then
dickie
was
not
an
ordinary
child
or
none
of
these
adventures
would
ever
have
happened
to
him
the
pawnbroker
always
a
good
friend
to
dickie
had
the
wit
to
see
that
the
child
was
not
lying
when
he
said
that
the
box
and
the
bag
and
the
gold
pieces
had
been
given
to
him
he
changed
the
gold
pieces
stamped
with
the
image
of
queen
elizabeth
for
others
stamped
with
the
image
of
queen
victoria
and
he
gave
five
pounds
for
the
box
and
owned
that
he
should
make
a
little
a
very
little
out
of
it
and
if
your
grand
society
friends
give
you
any
more
treasures
you
know
the
house
to
come
to
the
fairest
house
in
the
trade
though
i
say
it
thank
you
very
much
said
dickie
you
been
a
good
friend
to
me
i
hope
some
day
i
shall
do
you
a
better
turn
than
the
little
you
make
out
of
my
boxes
and
things
the
jew
sold
the
box
that
very
week
for
twenty
guineas
and
dickie
and
beale
now
possessed
pounds
new
clothes
were
bought
more
furniture
pounds
of
the
money
was
put
in
the
savings
bank
dickie
bought
carving
tools
and
went
to
the
goldsmiths
institute
to
learn
to
use
them
the
front
bedroom
was
fitted
with
a
bench
for
dickie
the
back
was
a
kennel
for
the
dogs
which
beale
instantly
began
to
collect
the
front
room
was
a
parlor
a
real
parlor
a
decent
young
woman
amelia
by
name
was
engaged
to
come
in
every
day
and
do
for
them
the
clothes
they
wore
were
clean
the
food
they
ate
was
good
dickie
knowledge
of
an
ordered
life
in
a
great
house
helped
him
to
order
life
in
a
house
that
was
little
and
day
by
day
they
earned
their
living
the
new
life
was
fairly
started
and
now
dickie
felt
that
he
might
dare
to
go
back
through
the
three
hundred
years
to
all
that
was
waiting
for
him
there
but
i
will
only
stay
a
month
he
told
himself
a
month
here
and
a
month
there
that
will
keep
things
even
because
if
i
were
longer
there
than
i
am
here
i
should
not
be
growing
up
so
fast
here
as
i
should
there
and
everything
would
be
crooked
and
how
silly
if
i
were
a
grown
man
in
that
life
and
had
to
come
back
and
be
a
little
boy
in
this
i
do
not
pretend
that
the
idea
did
not
occur
to
dickie
now
that
beale
is
fairly
started
he
could
do
very
well
without
me
but
dickie
knew
better
he
dismissed
the
idea
besides
beale
had
been
good
to
him
and
he
loved
him
the
white
curtains
had
now
no
sordid
secrets
to
keep
and
when
the
landlord
called
for
the
rent
beale
was
able
to
ask
him
to
step
in
into
a
comfortable
room
with
a
horsehair
sofa
and
a
big
worn
a
carpet
four
old
mahogany
chairs
and
a
table
with
a
clean
checked
cloth
on
it
there
was
a
bright
clock
on
the
mantelpiece
and
vases
with
chrysanthemums
in
them
and
there
were
red
woollen
curtains
as
well
as
the
white
lace
ones
you
as
snug
as
snug
in
here
said
the
landlord
not
so
dusty
said
beale
shining
from
soap
a
look
at
my
dawgs
he
succeeded
in
selling
the
landlord
a
pup
for
ten
shillings
and
came
back
to
dickie
sitting
by
the
pleasant
firelight
it
all
very
smart
he
said
but
do
you
never
feel
the
fidgets
in
your
legs
i
kep
steady
and
keep
steady
i
will
but
in
the
spring
when
the
weather
gets
a
bit
open
what
say
to
shutting
up
the
little
and
taking
the
road
for
a
bit
gentlemen
do
it
even
he
added
wistfully
walking
towers
they
call
i
like
it
said
dickie
but
what
about
the
dogs
oh
amelia
do
for
them
a
fair
treat
all
but
fan
and
fly
as
go
along
of
us
i
dunno
what
it
is
he
said
makes
me
so
after
the
road
i
was
always
like
it
from
a
boy
could
get
me
to
school
so
they
could
allus
after
birds
nests
or
rabbits
or
the
like
not
but
what
i
liked
it
well
enough
where
i
was
bred
i
did
tell
you
did
i
we
passed
close
longside
our
old
that
time
we
slep
among
the
furze
bushes
i
do
my
father
alive
now
but
was
a
game
old
chap
should
wonder
but
what
he
stuck
it
out
let
go
and
see
him
some
day
said
dickie
i
dunno
said
beale
you
see
i
was
allus
a
great
hanxiety
to
and
besides
i
should
like
to
find
gone
best
not
know
nothing
that
what
i
say
but
he
sighed
as
he
said
it
and
he
filled
his
pipe
in
a
thoughtful
silence
chapter
vii
dickie
learns
many
things
that
night
dickie
could
not
sleep
and
as
he
lay
awake
a
great
resolve
grew
strong
within
him
he
would
try
once
more
the
magic
of
the
and
the
rattle
and
the
white
seal
and
try
to
get
back
into
that
other
world
so
he
crept
down
into
the
parlor
where
a
little
layer
of
clear
red
fire
still
burned
and
now
the
and
the
voices
and
the
magic
were
over
and
dickie
awoke
thrilled
to
feel
how
cleverly
he
had
managed
everything
moved
his
legs
in
the
bed
rejoicing
that
he
was
no
longer
lame
then
he
opened
his
eyes
to
feast
them
on
the
big
light
tapestried
room
but
the
room
was
not
tapestried
it
was
panelled
and
it
was
rather
dark
and
it
was
so
small
as
not
to
be
much
better
than
a
cupboard
this
surprised
dickie
more
than
anything
else
that
had
ever
happened
to
him
and
it
frightened
him
a
little
too
if
the
spell
of
the
and
the
rattle
and
the
white
seal
was
not
certain
to
take
him
where
he
wished
to
be
nothing
in
the
world
was
certain
he
might
be
anywhere
where
he
did
wish
to
be
he
might
be
any
one
whom
he
did
not
wish
to
be
i
never
try
it
again
he
said
if
i
get
out
of
this
i
stick
to
the
and
not
go
venturing
about
any
more
among
dreams
and
things
he
got
up
and
looked
out
of
a
narrow
window
from
it
he
saw
a
garden
but
it
was
not
a
garden
he
had
ever
seen
before
it
had
marble
seats
balustrades
and
the
damp
dews
of
autumn
hung
chill
about
its
almost
unleafed
trees
it
might
have
been
worse
it
might
have
been
a
prison
yard
he
told
himself
come
keep
your
heart
up
wherever
i
come
to
it
an
adventure
he
turned
back
to
the
room
and
looked
for
his
clothes
there
were
no
clothes
there
but
the
shirt
he
had
on
was
like
the
shirt
he
had
slept
in
at
the
beautiful
house
he
turned
to
open
the
door
and
there
was
no
door
all
was
dark
even
panelling
he
was
not
shut
in
a
room
but
in
a
box
nonsense
boxes
did
not
have
beds
in
them
and
windows
and
then
suddenly
he
was
no
longer
the
clever
person
who
had
managed
everything
so
admirably
who
was
living
two
lives
with
such
credit
in
both
who
was
managing
a
grown
man
for
that
grown
man
good
but
just
a
little
boy
rather
badly
frightened
the
little
shirt
was
the
only
thing
that
helped
and
that
only
gave
him
the
desperate
courage
to
beat
on
the
panels
and
shout
nurse
nurse
nurse
a
crack
of
light
split
and
opened
between
two
panels
they
slid
back
and
between
them
the
nurse
came
to
him
the
nurse
with
the
ruff
and
the
frilled
cap
and
the
kind
wrinkled
face
he
got
his
arms
round
her
big
comfortable
waist
there
there
my
lamb
she
said
petting
him
his
clothes
hung
over
her
arm
his
doublet
and
little
fat
breeches
his
stockings
and
the
shoes
with
rosettes
oh
i
here
oh
i
am
so
glad
i
thought
i
got
to
somewhere
different
she
sat
down
on
the
bed
and
began
to
dress
him
soothing
him
back
to
confidence
with
gentle
touches
and
pet
names
listen
she
said
when
it
came
to
the
silver
buttons
of
the
doublet
you
must
listen
carefully
it
is
a
month
since
you
went
away
but
i
thought
time
did
move
i
thought
it
was
the
money
upset
everything
she
said
it
always
does
upset
everything
i
ought
to
have
known
now
attend
carefully
no
one
knows
you
have
been
away
you
seemed
to
be
here
learning
and
playing
and
doing
everything
like
you
used
and
you
on
a
visit
now
to
your
cousins
at
your
uncle
town
house
and
you
all
have
lessons
together
thy
tutor
gives
them
and
thy
cousins
love
him
no
better
than
thou
dost
all
thou
hast
to
do
is
to
forget
thy
dream
and
take
up
thy
life
here
and
be
slow
to
speak
for
a
day
or
two
till
thou
hast
grown
used
to
thine
own
place
have
lessons
alone
one
of
the
cousins
goes
with
his
mother
to
be
her
page
and
bear
her
train
at
the
king
revels
at
whitehall
and
the
other
must
sit
and
sew
her
sampler
her
mother
says
she
hath
run
wild
too
long
so
dickie
had
lessons
alone
with
his
detested
tutor
and
his
relief
from
the
panic
fear
of
the
morning
raised
his
spirits
to
a
degree
that
unfortunately
found
vent
in
what
was
for
him
extreme
naughtiness
he
drew
a
comic
picture
of
his
tutor
it
really
was
rather
like
with
a
scroll
coming
out
of
his
mouth
and
on
the
scroll
the
words
because
i
am
ugly
i
need
not
be
hateful
his
tutor
who
had
a
nasty
way
of
creeping
up
behind
people
came
up
behind
him
at
the
wrong
moment
dickie
was
caned
on
both
hands
and
kept
in
also
his
dinner
was
of
bread
and
water
and
he
had
to
write
out
two
hundred
times
i
am
a
bad
boy
and
i
ask
the
pardon
of
my
good
tutor
the
fifth
day
of
november
so
he
did
not
see
his
aunt
and
cousin
in
their
whitehall
finery
and
it
was
quite
late
in
the
afternoon
before
he
even
saw
his
other
cousin
who
had
been
he
would
not
have
written
out
the
lines
he
felt
sure
he
would
not
only
he
thought
of
his
cousin
and
wanted
to
see
her
again
for
she
was
the
only
little
girl
friend
he
had
when
the
last
was
done
he
rushed
into
the
room
where
she
was
he
was
astonished
to
find
that
he
knew
his
way
about
the
house
quite
well
though
he
could
not
remember
ever
having
been
there
before
and
cried
out
thy
task
done
mine
is
too
old
kept
me
hard
at
it
but
i
thought
of
thee
and
for
this
once
i
did
all
his
biddings
so
now
we
are
free
come
play
ball
in
the
garden
his
cousin
looked
up
from
her
sampler
set
the
frame
down
and
jumped
up
i
am
so
glad
she
said
i
do
hate
this
horrid
sampler
and
as
she
said
it
dickie
had
a
most
odd
feeling
rather
as
if
a
clock
had
struck
or
had
stopped
striking
a
feeling
of
sudden
change
but
he
could
not
wait
to
wonder
about
it
or
to
question
what
it
was
that
he
really
felt
his
cousin
was
waiting
come
elfrida
he
said
and
held
out
his
hand
they
went
together
into
the
garden
now
if
you
have
read
a
book
called
the
house
of
arden
you
will
already
know
that
dickie
cousins
were
called
edred
and
elfrida
and
that
their
father
lord
arden
had
a
beautiful
castle
by
the
sea
as
well
as
a
house
in
london
and
that
he
and
his
wife
were
great
favorites
at
the
court
of
king
james
the
first
if
you
have
not
read
that
book
and
did
already
know
these
things
well
you
know
them
now
and
arden
was
dickie
own
name
too
in
this
old
life
and
his
father
was
sir
richard
arden
of
deptford
and
aylesbury
and
his
tutor
was
parados
called
for
short
by
his
disrespectful
pupils
dickie
and
elfrida
played
ball
and
they
played
and
they
ran
races
he
preferred
play
to
talk
just
then
he
did
not
want
to
let
out
the
fact
that
he
remembered
nothing
whatever
of
the
doings
of
the
last
month
elfrida
did
not
seem
very
anxious
to
talk
either
the
garden
was
most
interesting
and
the
only
blot
on
the
scene
was
the
black
figure
of
the
tutor
walking
up
and
down
with
a
sour
face
and
his
thumbs
in
one
of
his
books
the
children
sat
down
on
the
step
of
one
of
the
stone
seats
and
dickie
was
wondering
why
he
had
felt
that
queer
feeling
when
he
was
roused
from
his
wonderings
by
hearing
elfrida
say
please
to
remember
the
fifth
of
november
the
gunpowder
treason
and
plot
i
see
no
reason
why
gunpowder
treason
should
ever
be
forgot
how
odd
he
thought
i
did
know
that
was
so
old
as
all
this
and
he
remembered
hearing
his
father
sir
richard
arden
say
treason
a
dangerous
word
to
let
lie
on
your
lips
these
days
so
he
said
is
not
a
merry
song
cousin
nor
a
safe
one
is
best
not
to
sing
of
treason
but
it
did
come
off
you
know
and
he
always
burnt
in
the
end
so
already
guy
fawkes
burnings
went
on
dickie
wondered
whether
there
would
be
a
bonfire
it
the
fifth
of
november
he
had
had
to
write
the
date
two
hundred
times
so
he
was
fairly
certain
of
it
he
was
afraid
of
saying
too
much
or
too
little
and
for
the
life
of
him
he
could
not
remember
the
date
of
the
gunpowder
plot
still
he
must
say
something
so
he
said
are
there
more
verses
no
said
elfrida
i
wonder
he
said
trying
to
feel
his
way
what
treason
the
ballad
deals
with
he
felt
it
had
been
the
wrong
thing
to
say
when
elfrida
answered
in
surprised
tones
do
you
know
know
and
i
know
some
of
the
names
of
the
conspirators
and
who
they
wanted
to
kill
and
everything
tell
me
seemed
the
wisest
thing
to
say
and
he
said
it
as
carelessly
as
he
could
the
king
had
been
fair
to
the
catholics
you
know
said
elfrida
who
evidently
knew
all
about
the
matter
so
a
lot
of
them
decided
to
kill
him
and
the
houses
of
parliament
they
made
a
plot
there
were
a
whole
lot
of
them
in
it
the
feeling
came
on
again
elfrida
was
different
somehow
the
elfrida
who
had
gone
on
the
barge
to
gravesend
and
played
with
him
at
the
deptford
house
had
never
used
such
expressions
as
a
whole
lot
of
them
in
it
he
looked
at
her
and
she
went
on
they
said
lord
arden
was
in
it
but
he
was
and
some
of
them
were
to
pretend
to
be
hunting
and
to
seize
the
princess
elizabeth
and
proclaim
her
queen
and
the
rest
were
to
blow
the
houses
of
parliament
up
when
the
king
went
to
open
them
i
never
heard
this
tale
from
my
tutor
said
dickie
and
without
knowing
why
he
felt
uneasy
and
because
he
felt
uneasy
he
laughed
then
he
said
proceed
cousin
elfrida
went
on
telling
him
about
the
gunpowder
plot
but
he
hardly
listened
the
feeling
was
growing
so
strong
but
he
heard
her
say
tresham
wrote
to
his
relation
lord
monteagle
that
they
were
going
to
blow
up
the
king
and
he
found
himself
saying
what
king
though
he
knew
the
answer
perfectly
well
why
king
james
the
first
said
elfrida
and
suddenly
the
horrible
tutor
pounced
and
got
elfrida
by
the
wrist
then
all
in
a
moment
everything
grew
confused
parados
was
asking
questions
and
little
elfrida
was
trying
to
answer
them
and
dickie
understood
that
the
gunpowder
plot
not
happened
and
that
elfrida
had
given
the
whole
show
away
how
did
she
know
and
the
verse
tell
me
all
every
name
every
particular
the
loathsome
tutor
was
saying
or
it
will
be
the
worse
for
thee
and
thy
father
elfrida
was
positively
green
with
terror
and
looked
appealingly
at
dickie
come
sir
he
said
in
as
manly
a
voice
as
he
could
manage
you
frighten
my
cousin
it
is
but
a
tale
she
told
she
is
always
merry
and
full
of
many
inventions
but
the
tutor
would
not
be
silenced
and
it
in
history
he
heard
elfrida
say
what
followed
was
a
mist
of
horrible
things
when
the
mist
cleared
dickie
found
himself
alone
in
the
house
with
parados
the
nurse
and
the
servants
for
the
earl
and
countess
of
arden
edred
and
elfrida
were
lodged
in
the
tower
of
london
on
a
charge
of
high
treason
for
this
was
it
seemed
the
fifth
of
november
the
day
on
which
the
gunpowder
plot
should
have
been
carried
out
and
elfrida
it
was
and
not
tresham
lord
monteagle
cousin
who
had
given
away
the
whole
business
but
how
had
elfrida
known
could
it
be
that
she
had
dreams
like
his
and
in
those
dreams
visited
later
times
when
all
this
was
matter
of
history
dickie
brain
felt
fat
swollen
as
though
it
would
burst
and
he
was
glad
to
go
to
bed
even
in
that
cupboardy
place
with
the
panels
but
he
begged
the
nurse
to
leave
the
panel
open
and
when
he
woke
next
day
it
was
all
true
his
aunt
and
uncle
and
his
two
cousins
were
in
the
tower
and
gloom
hung
over
arden
house
in
soho
like
a
black
over
a
mountain
and
the
days
went
on
and
lessons
with
parados
were
a
sort
of
inquisition
torture
to
dickie
for
the
tutor
never
let
a
day
pass
without
trying
to
find
out
whether
dickie
had
shared
in
any
way
that
guilty
knowledge
of
elfrida
which
had
so
parados
insisted
overthrown
the
fell
plot
of
the
papists
and
preserved
to
a
loyal
people
his
most
gracious
majesty
james
the
first
and
then
one
day
quite
as
though
it
were
the
most
natural
thing
in
the
world
his
cousin
edred
and
lady
arden
his
aunt
were
set
free
from
the
tower
and
came
home
the
king
had
suddenly
decided
that
they
at
least
had
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
plot
lady
arden
cried
all
the
time
and
as
dickie
owned
to
himself
there
was
enough
to
make
her
but
edred
was
full
of
half
plans
and
schemes
for
being
revenged
on
old
and
at
last
he
really
did
arrange
a
scheme
for
getting
elfrida
out
of
the
tower
a
perfectly
workable
scheme
and
what
is
more
it
worked
if
you
want
to
know
how
it
was
done
ask
some
to
tell
you
how
lady
nithsdale
got
her
husband
out
of
the
tower
when
he
was
a
prisoner
there
and
in
danger
of
having
his
head
cut
off
and
you
will
readily
understand
the
kind
of
scheme
it
was
a
necessary
part
of
it
was
the
dressing
up
of
elfrida
in
boy
clothes
and
her
coming
out
of
the
tower
pretending
to
be
edred
who
with
richard
had
come
in
to
visit
lord
arden
then
the
guard
at
the
tower
gateway
was
changed
and
another
edred
came
out
and
they
all
got
into
a
coach
and
there
was
elfrida
under
the
coach
seat
among
the
straw
and
other
people
feet
and
they
all
hugged
each
other
in
the
dark
coach
as
it
jolted
through
the
snowy
streets
to
arden
house
in
soho
dickie
feeling
very
small
and
bewildered
among
all
these
dangerous
happenings
found
himself
suddenly
caught
by
the
arm
the
nurse
hand
it
was
now
she
said
master
richard
will
go
take
off
his
fine
suit
and
he
did
not
hear
the
end
for
he
was
pushed
out
of
the
room
very
discontentedly
he
found
his
way
to
his
panelled
and
took
off
the
smart
velvet
and
fur
which
he
had
worn
in
his
visit
to
the
tower
and
put
on
his
things
you
may
be
sure
he
made
every
possible
haste
to
get
back
to
his
cousins
he
wanted
to
talk
over
the
whole
wonderful
adventure
with
them
he
found
them
whispering
in
a
corner
what
is
it
he
asked
we
going
to
be
even
with
old
said
edred
but
you
must
be
in
it
because
we
going
away
and
you
got
to
stay
here
and
whatever
we
decide
to
do
you
get
the
blame
of
it
i
do
see
said
richard
why
i
should
have
a
hand
in
what
wanted
to
do
these
four
years
he
had
not
known
that
he
had
known
the
tutor
for
four
years
but
as
he
said
the
words
he
felt
that
they
were
true
there
is
a
reason
said
edred
you
go
to
bed
richard
not
me
said
dickie
of
deptford
firmly
if
we
tell
you
said
elfrida
explaining
affectionately
you
believe
us
you
might
at
least
said
richard
arden
catching
desperately
at
the
grand
manner
that
seemed
to
suit
these
times
of
ruff
and
sword
and
cloak
and
conspiracy
you
might
at
least
make
the
trial
very
well
i
will
said
elfrida
abruptly
no
edred
he
has
a
right
to
hear
he
one
of
us
he
wo
give
us
away
will
you
dickie
dear
you
know
i
wo
dickie
assured
her
well
then
said
elfrida
slowly
we
are
you
listen
hard
and
believe
with
both
hands
and
with
all
your
might
or
you
wo
be
able
to
believe
at
all
we
are
not
what
we
seem
edred
and
i
we
do
really
belong
here
at
all
i
do
know
what
become
of
the
elfrida
and
edred
who
belong
to
this
time
have
we
seemed
odd
to
you
at
all
different
i
mean
from
the
edred
and
elfrida
you
been
used
to
the
remembrance
of
the
feeling
came
strongly
on
dickie
and
he
nodded
well
that
because
we
them
we
do
belong
here
we
belong
three
hundred
years
later
in
history
only
we
got
a
charm
because
in
our
time
edred
is
lord
arden
and
there
a
white
mole
who
helps
us
and
we
can
go
anywhere
in
history
we
like
not
quite
said
edred
no
but
there
are
chests
of
different
clothes
and
whatever
clothes
we
put
on
we
come
to
that
time
in
history
i
know
it
sounds
like
silly
untruths
she
added
rather
sadly
and
i
knew
you
would
believe
it
but
it
true
and
now
we
going
back
to
our
times
queen
alexandra
you
know
and
king
edward
the
seventh
and
electric
light
and
motors
and
do
try
to
believe
it
if
it
hurts
you
dickie
dear
i
know
it
most
awfully
rum
but
it
the
real
true
truth
richard
said
nothing
had
never
thought
it
possible
but
that
he
was
the
only
one
to
whom
things
like
this
happened
you
do
believe
it
said
edred
complacently
i
knew
you
would
dickie
felt
a
swimming
sensation
it
impossible
that
this
wonderful
change
should
happen
to
any
one
besides
himself
this
just
meant
that
the
whole
thing
was
a
dream
and
he
said
nothing
never
mind
said
elfrida
in
comforting
tones
do
try
to
believe
it
i
know
you
ca
forget
it
or
pretend
we
were
just
kidding
you
well
it
does
matter
edred
said
what
can
we
do
to
pay
out
old
then
richard
found
a
voice
and
words
i
do
like
it
he
said
it
never
been
like
this
before
it
makes
it
seem
not
real
it
only
a
dream
really
i
suppose
and
i
got
to
believe
that
it
was
really
real
i
do
understand
a
word
you
saying
said
edred
and
darting
to
a
corner
produced
a
photographic
camera
of
the
kind
called
brownie
look
here
he
said
you
never
seen
anything
like
before
this
comes
from
the
times
we
belong
to
richard
knew
it
well
a
boy
at
school
had
had
one
and
he
had
borrowed
it
once
and
the
assistant
master
had
had
a
larger
one
of
the
same
kind
it
was
horrible
to
him
this
intrusion
of
the
scientific
attainments
of
the
ugly
times
in
which
he
was
born
into
the
beautiful
times
that
he
had
grown
to
love
oh
stow
it
he
said
i
know
now
it
all
a
silly
dream
but
it
not
worth
while
to
pretend
i
do
know
a
kodak
when
i
see
it
that
a
brownie
if
you
dreamed
about
our
time
said
elfrida
did
you
ever
dream
of
fire
carriages
and
and
richard
explained
that
he
was
not
a
baby
that
he
knew
all
about
railways
and
steamboats
and
the
triumphs
of
civilization
and
added
that
kent
made
against
derbyshire
last
thursday
edred
and
elfrida
began
to
ask
questions
dickie
was
much
too
full
of
his
own
questionings
to
answer
theirs
i
sha
tell
you
anything
more
he
said
but
i
help
you
to
get
even
with
old
and
suggested
shovelling
the
snow
off
the
roof
into
the
room
of
that
dismal
tyrant
through
the
skylight
conveniently
lighting
it
but
edred
wanted
that
written
down
about
kent
and
derbyshire
so
that
they
might
see
when
they
got
back
to
their
own
times
whether
it
was
true
and
dickie
found
he
had
a
bit
of
paper
in
his
doublet
on
which
to
write
it
it
was
a
bill
he
had
had
it
in
his
hand
when
he
made
the
magic
pattern
and
it
had
unaccountably
come
with
him
it
was
a
bill
for
three
ship
guns
and
compasses
and
six
flags
which
beale
had
bought
for
him
in
london
for
the
fitting
out
of
a
little
ship
he
had
made
to
order
for
the
small
son
of
the
amiable
pawnbroker
he
scribbled
on
the
back
of
this
bill
gave
it
to
edred
and
then
they
all
went
out
on
the
roof
and
shovelled
snow
in
on
to
parados
and
when
he
came
out
on
the
roof
very
soon
and
angry
they
slipped
round
the
and
through
the
and
left
him
up
on
the
roof
in
the
snow
and
shut
the
and
hasped
it
and
then
the
nurse
caught
them
and
richard
was
sent
to
bed
but
he
did
not
go
there
was
no
sleep
in
that
house
that
night
sleepiness
filled
it
like
a
thick
fog
dickie
put
out
his
rushlight
and
stayed
quiet
for
a
little
while
but
presently
it
was
impossible
to
stay
quiet
another
moment
so
very
softly
and
carefully
he
crept
out
and
hid
behind
a
tall
press
at
the
end
of
the
passage
he
felt
that
strange
things
were
happening
in
the
house
and
that
he
must
know
what
they
were
presently
there
were
voices
below
voices
coming
up
the
stairs
the
nurse
voice
his
cousins
and
another
voice
where
had
he
heard
that
other
voice
the
feeling
was
thick
about
him
as
he
realized
that
this
was
one
of
the
voices
he
had
heard
on
that
night
of
the
first
magic
the
voice
that
had
said
he
is
more
yours
than
mine
the
light
the
nurse
carried
gleamed
and
disappeared
up
the
second
flight
of
stairs
dickie
followed
he
had
to
follow
he
could
not
be
left
out
of
this
the
most
mysterious
of
all
the
happenings
that
had
so
wonderfully
come
to
him
he
saw
when
he
reached
the
upper
landing
that
the
others
were
by
the
window
and
that
the
window
was
open
a
keen
wind
rushed
through
it
and
by
the
blown
candle
light
he
could
see
snowflakes
whirled
into
the
house
through
the
window
dark
square
there
was
whispering
going
on
he
heard
her
words
here
so
jump
and
then
a
little
figure
edred
it
must
be
no
elfrida
climbed
up
on
to
the
and
jumped
out
out
of
the
window
undoubtedly
jumped
another
followed
it
that
was
edred
it
a
dream
said
dickie
to
himself
but
if
they
been
made
to
jump
out
to
punish
them
for
getting
even
with
old
or
anything
i
jump
too
he
rushed
past
the
nurse
past
her
voice
and
the
other
voice
that
was
talking
with
hers
made
one
bound
to
the
window
set
his
knee
on
it
stood
up
and
jumped
and
he
heard
as
his
knee
touched
the
icy
the
strange
voice
say
another
and
then
he
was
in
the
air
falling
falling
i
shall
wake
when
i
reach
the
ground
dickie
told
himself
and
then
i
shall
know
it
all
only
a
dream
a
silly
dream
but
he
never
reached
the
ground
he
had
not
fallen
a
couple
of
yards
before
he
was
caught
by
something
soft
as
heaped
feathers
or
drifted
snow
it
moved
and
shifted
under
him
took
shape
it
was
a
chair
no
a
carriage
and
there
were
reins
in
his
hand
white
reins
and
a
horse
no
a
swan
with
wide
white
wings
he
grasped
the
reins
and
guided
the
strange
steed
to
a
low
swoop
that
should
bring
him
near
the
flare
of
torches
in
the
street
outside
the
great
front
door
and
as
the
swan
laid
its
long
neck
low
in
downward
flight
he
saw
his
cousins
in
a
carriage
like
his
own
rise
into
the
sky
and
sail
away
towards
the
south
quite
without
meaning
to
do
it
he
pulled
on
the
reins
the
swan
rose
he
pulled
again
and
the
carriage
stopped
at
the
landing
window
hands
dragged
him
in
the
old
nurse
hands
the
swan
glided
away
between
snow
and
stars
and
on
the
landing
inside
the
open
window
the
nurse
held
him
fast
in
her
arms
my
lamb
she
said
my
dear
foolish
brave
lamb
dickie
was
pulling
himself
together
if
it
a
dream
he
said
slowly
i
had
enough
i
want
to
wake
up
if
it
real
real
with
magic
in
it
you
got
to
explain
it
all
to
me
every
bit
i
ca
go
on
like
this
it
not
fair
oh
tell
him
and
have
done
said
the
voice
that
had
begun
all
the
magic
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
something
small
and
white
slid
along
the
wainscot
of
the
corridor
and
vanished
quite
suddenly
just
as
a
candle
flame
does
when
you
blow
the
candle
out
i
will
said
the
nurse
come
love
i
tell
you
everything
she
took
him
down
into
a
warm
curtained
room
blew
to
flame
the
gray
ashes
on
the
open
hearth
gave
him
elder
wine
to
drink
hot
and
spiced
and
kneeling
before
him
rubbing
his
cold
bare
feet
she
told
him
there
are
certain
children
born
now
and
then
it
does
not
often
happen
but
now
and
then
it
does
children
who
are
not
bound
by
time
as
other
people
are
and
if
the
right
bit
of
magic
comes
their
way
those
children
have
the
power
to
go
back
and
forth
in
time
just
as
other
children
go
back
and
forth
in
space
the
space
of
a
room
a
or
a
garden
alley
often
children
lose
this
power
when
they
are
quite
young
sometimes
it
comes
to
them
gradually
so
that
they
hardly
know
when
it
begins
and
leaves
them
as
gradually
like
a
dream
when
you
wake
and
stretch
yourself
sometimes
it
comes
by
the
saying
of
a
charm
that
is
how
edred
and
elfrida
found
it
they
came
from
the
time
that
you
were
born
in
and
they
have
been
living
in
this
time
with
you
and
now
they
have
gone
back
to
their
own
time
did
you
notice
any
difference
in
them
from
what
they
were
at
deptford
i
should
think
i
did
said
dickie
at
least
it
was
that
i
any
difference
so
much
as
that
i
something
queer
i
could
understand
it
it
felt
stuffy
as
if
something
was
going
to
burst
that
was
because
they
were
not
the
cousins
you
knew
at
deptford
but
where
have
the
real
cousins
i
knew
at
deptford
been
then
all
this
time
while
those
other
kids
were
here
pretending
to
be
them
dickie
asked
oh
they
were
somewhere
else
in
julius
cæsar
time
to
be
exact
but
they
do
know
it
and
never
will
know
it
they
have
the
charm
to
them
it
will
be
like
a
dream
that
they
have
forgotten
but
the
swans
and
the
carriages
and
the
voice
and
jumping
out
of
the
window
dickie
urged
the
swans
were
white
magic
the
white
mouldiwarp
of
arden
did
all
that
then
she
told
him
all
about
the
white
mouldiwarp
of
arden
and
how
it
was
the
badge
of
arden
house
its
picture
being
engraved
on
tinkler
and
how
it
had
done
all
sorts
of
magic
for
edred
and
elfrida
and
would
do
still
more
dickie
and
the
nurse
sat
most
of
the
night
talking
by
the
replenished
fire
for
the
tale
seemed
endless
dickie
learned
that
the
edred
and
elfrida
who
belonged
to
his
own
times
had
a
father
who
was
supposed
to
be
dead
i
am
forbidden
to
tell
them
said
the
nurse
but
canst
help
them
and
shalt
i
should
like
that
said
dickie
but
ca
see
the
white
mouldiwarp
i
dare
not
even
dare
not
call
it
again
the
nurse
owned
but
maybe
i
will
teach
thee
a
little
spell
to
bring
it
on
another
day
it
is
an
angry
little
beast
at
times
but
kindly
and
then
dickie
told
her
about
the
beginnings
of
the
magic
and
how
he
had
heard
voices
one
of
them
the
mouldiwarp
there
are
three
white
mouldiwarps
friends
to
thy
house
she
told
him
the
mouldiwarp
who
is
the
badge
and
the
mouldiwarp
who
is
the
crest
and
the
great
mouldiwarp
who
sits
on
the
green
and
white
checkered
field
of
the
ardens
shield
of
arms
it
was
the
first
two
who
talked
of
thee
and
how
can
i
find
my
cousins
and
help
them
to
find
their
father
lay
out
the
and
the
other
charms
and
wish
to
be
where
they
are
going
then
thou
canst
speak
with
them
wish
to
be
there
a
week
before
they
come
that
thou
mayst
know
the
place
and
the
folk
now
dickie
asked
but
not
eagerly
for
he
was
very
tired
not
now
my
lamb
she
said
and
so
at
last
dickie
went
to
bed
his
weary
brain
full
of
new
things
more
than
any
dreams
he
had
ever
had
after
this
he
talked
with
the
nurse
every
day
and
learned
more
and
more
wonders
of
which
there
is
no
time
now
for
me
to
tell
you
but
they
are
all
written
in
the
book
of
the
house
of
arden
in
that
book
too
it
is
written
how
dickie
went
back
from
the
first
james
time
to
the
time
of
the
eighth
henry
and
took
part
in
the
merry
country
life
of
those
days
and
there
found
the
old
nurse
herself
edred
and
elfrida
and
helped
them
to
recover
their
father
from
a
far
country
there
also
you
may
read
of
the
marvels
of
the
white
clock
and
the
cliff
that
none
could
climb
and
the
children
who
were
white
cats
and
the
mouldiwarp
who
became
as
big
as
a
polar
bear
with
other
wonders
and
when
all
this
was
over
elfrida
and
edred
wanted
dickie
to
come
back
with
them
to
their
own
time
but
he
would
not
he
went
back
instead
to
the
time
he
loved
when
james
the
first
was
king
and
when
he
woke
in
the
little
panelled
room
it
seemed
to
him
that
all
this
was
only
dreams
and
fancies
in
the
course
of
this
adventure
he
met
the
white
mouldiwarp
and
it
was
just
a
white
mole
very
funny
and
rather
the
second
mouldiwarp
he
had
not
yet
met
i
have
told
you
all
these
things
very
shortly
because
they
were
so
to
dickie
and
not
at
all
real
like
the
double
life
he
had
been
leading
that
always
happens
said
the
nurse
if
you
stumble
into
some
one
else
magic
it
never
feels
real
but
if
you
bring
them
into
yours
quite
another
pair
of
sleeves
those
children
ca
get
any
more
magic
of
their
own
now
but
you
could
take
them
into
yours
only
for
that
you
have
to
meet
them
in
your
own
time
that
you
were
born
in
and
you
have
to
wait
till
it
summer
because
that
where
they
are
now
they
seven
months
ahead
of
you
in
your
own
time
but
said
dickie
very
much
bewildered
as
i
am
myself
and
as
i
am
afraid
you
too
must
be
if
they
seven
months
ahead
wo
they
always
be
seven
months
ahead
odds
bodikins
said
the
nurse
impatiently
how
often
am
i
to
tell
you
that
there
no
such
thing
as
time
but
there
seasons
and
the
season
they
came
out
of
was
summer
and
the
season
you
go
back
to
is
autumn
so
you
live
the
seven
months
in
their
time
and
then
it
be
summer
and
you
meet
them
and
what
about
lord
arden
in
the
tower
will
he
be
beheaded
for
treason
dickie
asked
oh
part
of
their
magic
it
is
in
your
magic
at
all
lord
arden
will
be
safe
enough
and
now
my
lamb
i
more
to
tell
thee
but
come
into
thy
panelled
chamber
where
thy
tutor
can
not
eavesdrop
and
betray
us
and
have
thee
given
over
to
him
wholly
and
me
burned
for
a
witch
these
terrible
words
kept
dickie
silent
till
he
and
the
nurse
were
safe
in
his
room
and
then
he
said
come
with
me
to
my
time
nurse
they
do
burn
people
for
witches
there
no
said
the
nurse
but
they
let
them
live
such
lives
in
their
ugly
towns
that
my
life
here
with
all
its
risks
is
far
better
worth
living
thou
knowest
how
folk
live
in
deptford
in
thy
time
how
all
the
green
trees
are
gone
and
good
work
is
gone
and
people
do
bad
work
for
just
so
much
as
will
keep
together
their
worn
bodies
and
desolate
souls
and
sometimes
they
starve
to
death
and
they
wo
burn
me
if
only
keep
a
still
tongue
now
listen
she
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
dickie
cuddled
up
against
her
stiff
bodice
edred
and
elfrida
first
went
into
the
past
to
look
for
treasure
it
is
a
treasure
buried
in
arden
castle
by
the
sea
which
is
their
home
they
want
the
treasure
to
restore
the
splendor
of
the
old
castle
which
in
your
time
is
fallen
into
ruin
and
decay
and
to
mend
the
houses
of
the
tenants
and
to
do
good
to
the
poor
and
needy
but
you
know
that
now
they
have
used
their
magic
to
get
back
their
father
and
can
no
longer
use
it
to
look
for
treasure
but
your
magic
will
hold
and
if
you
lay
out
your
round
in
the
old
shape
and
stand
with
them
in
the
midst
holding
your
tinkler
and
your
white
seal
you
will
all
go
whithersoever
you
choose
i
shall
choose
to
go
straight
to
the
treasure
of
course
said
practical
dickie
swinging
his
feet
in
their
rosetted
shoes
that
thou
canst
not
thou
canst
only
choose
some
year
in
the
past
any
year
go
into
it
and
then
seek
for
the
treasure
there
and
then
i
do
it
dickie
said
and
then
i
may
come
back
to
you
may
i
if
not
needed
elsewhere
the
ardens
stay
where
duty
binds
them
and
go
where
duty
calls
but
i
not
an
arden
said
dickie
sadly
richard
arden
there
as
here
she
said
thy
grandfather
name
got
changed
by
breathing
hard
on
it
from
arden
to
harden
and
that
again
to
harding
thus
names
are
changed
ever
and
again
and
dickie
of
deptford
has
the
honor
of
the
house
of
arden
to
uphold
there
as
here
then
as
now
i
shall
call
myself
arden
when
i
go
back
said
dickie
proudly
not
yet
she
said
wait
if
you
say
so
said
dickie
rather
discontentedly
the
time
is
not
ripe
for
thee
to
take
up
all
thine
honors
there
she
said
and
now
dear
lamb
since
thy
tutor
is
imagining
unkind
things
in
his
heart
for
thee
go
quickly
set
out
thy
and
when
thou
hearest
the
voices
say
would
see
both
mouldiwarps
and
thou
shalt
see
them
both
thank
you
said
dickie
i
do
want
to
see
them
both
see
them
he
did
in
a
mist
in
which
he
could
feel
nothing
solid
not
even
the
ground
under
his
feet
or
the
touch
of
his
clenched
fingers
against
his
palms
they
were
very
white
the
mouldiwarps
outlined
distinctly
against
the
gray
blueness
and
the
mouldiwarp
he
had
seen
in
that
wonderful
adventure
in
the
far
country
smiled
as
well
as
a
mole
can
and
said
a
fair
sprig
of
de
old
tree
muster
dickie
so
be
in
the
thick
speech
of
the
peasant
people
round
about
talbot
house
where
dickie
had
once
been
a
little
burglar
he
is
indeed
a
worthy
scion
of
the
great
house
we
serve
said
the
other
mouldiwarp
with
precise
and
gentle
utterance
as
mouldierwarp
to
the
ardens
i
can
but
own
that
i
am
proud
of
him
the
mouldierwarp
had
as
well
as
a
gentle
voice
a
finer
nose
than
the
mouldiwarp
his
fur
was
more
even
and
his
claws
sharper
eh
you
be
a
gentleman
you
be
said
the
mouldiwarp
so
so
there
two
of
ye
sure
enough
it
was
very
odd
to
see
and
hear
these
white
moles
talking
like
real
people
and
looking
like
figures
on
a
screen
but
dickie
did
not
enjoy
it
as
much
as
perhaps
you
or
i
would
have
done
it
was
not
his
pet
kind
of
magic
he
liked
the
good
straightforward
kind
of
magic
that
he
was
accustomed
to
the
kind
that
just
took
you
out
of
one
life
into
another
life
and
made
both
lives
as
real
one
as
the
other
still
one
must
always
be
polite
so
he
said
i
am
very
glad
to
see
you
both
there
purty
manners
the
mouldiwarp
said
the
pleasure
is
ours
said
the
mouldierwarp
instantly
dickie
could
not
help
seeing
that
both
these
old
creatures
were
extremely
pleased
with
him
when
shall
i
see
the
other
mouldiwarp
he
asked
to
keep
up
the
conversation
the
one
on
our
shield
of
arms
you
mean
the
mouldiestwarp
said
the
mouldier
as
i
will
now
call
him
for
short
you
will
not
see
him
till
the
end
of
the
magic
he
is
very
great
i
work
the
magic
of
space
my
brother
here
works
the
magic
of
time
and
the
great
mouldiestwarp
controls
us
and
many
things
beside
you
must
only
call
on
him
when
you
wish
to
end
our
magics
and
to
work
a
magic
greater
than
ours
what
could
be
greater
dickie
asked
and
both
the
creatures
looked
very
pleased
he
is
a
worthier
arden
than
those
little
black
and
white
chits
of
thine
the
mouldier
said
to
the
mouldy
which
is
what
to
save
time
we
will
now
call
the
mouldiwarp
an
so
should
be
an
so
should
be
said
the
mouldy
shortly
for
the
best
and
the
end
to
come
where
ye
want
to
go
my
lord
i
not
lord
i
only
richard
arden
said
dickie
and
i
want
to
go
back
to
beale
and
stay
with
him
for
seven
months
and
then
to
find
my
cousins
back
thou
goes
then
said
the
mouldy
that
part
easy
and
for
the
second
half
of
thy
wish
no
magic
is
needed
but
the
magic
of
steadfast
heart
and
the
patient
purpose
and
these
thou
hast
without
any
helping
or
giving
of
ours
said
the
courtly
mouldierwarp
they
waved
their
white
paws
on
the
curtain
of
mist
and
behold
they
were
not
there
any
more
and
the
mist
was
only
the
night
darkness
turning
to
dawn
and
dickie
was
able
again
to
feel
solid
things
the
floor
under
him
his
hand
on
the
sharp
edge
of
the
armchair
and
the
soft
breathing
comfortable
weight
of
true
asleep
against
his
knee
he
moved
the
dog
awoke
and
dickie
felt
its
soft
nose
nuzzled
into
his
hand
and
now
for
seven
months
work
and
not
one
good
dream
said
dickie
got
up
put
tinkler
and
the
seal
and
the
into
a
very
safe
place
and
crept
back
to
bed
he
felt
rather
heroic
he
did
not
want
the
treasure
it
was
not
for
him
he
was
going
to
help
edred
and
elfrida
to
get
it
he
did
not
want
the
life
at
lavender
terrace
he
was
going
to
help
beale
to
live
it
so
let
him
feel
a
little
bit
of
a
hero
since
that
was
what
indeed
he
was
even
though
of
course
all
children
are
modest
and
humble
and
fully
sensible
of
their
own
intense
unimportance
no
matter
how
heroically
they
may
happen
to
be
behaving
chapter
viii
going
home
in
deptford
the
seven
months
had
almost
gone
by
dickie
had
worked
much
learned
much
and
earned
much
beale
a
figure
of
cleanly
habit
and
increasing
steadiness
seemed
like
a
plant
growing
quickly
towards
the
sun
of
respectability
or
a
lighthouse
rising
bright
and
important
out
of
a
swirling
sea
of
dogs
for
the
prospered
exceedingly
and
beale
had
grown
knowing
in
thoroughbreeds
and
the
prize
bench
had
learned
all
about
distemper
and
doggy
fits
and
when
you
should
give
an
ailing
dog
and
when
you
should
merely
give
it
less
to
eat
and
the
money
in
the
bank
grew
till
it
so
to
speak
burst
the
and
had
to
be
allowed
to
overflow
into
a
vast
sea
called
consols
the
dogs
also
grew
in
numbers
as
well
as
in
size
and
the
neighbors
who
had
borne
a
good
deal
very
patiently
began
as
beale
said
to
pass
remarks
it
ai
so
much
the
little
they
jib
at
said
beale
taking
his
pipe
out
of
his
mouth
and
stretching
his
legs
in
the
though
to
my
mind
they
yaps
far
more

cocker
spannel

persevering
bark

dickie
looking
up
at
the
in
the
no
flowers
would
grow
in
the
garden
now
trampled
hard
by
the
feet
of
many
dogs
but
dickie
did
his
best
with
and
every
window
was
underlined
by
a
bright
dash
of
color
brompton
stocks
stonecrop
and
late
tulips
and
all
bought
from
the
barrows
in
the
high
street
made
a
brave
show
i
do
say
as
they
actin
unneighborly
in
talking
about
the
pleece
so
long
as
they
do
do
no
than

with
studied
fairness
and
moderation

sighed
with
the
air
of
an
old
man

back
on

days
of
youth

said

outer
yer
mouth
with
sleepiness
and
no
fear
o
the
counterpin
afire
what
you

matey
eh
dickie
looked
lovingly
at
the
smart
back
of
the
little
house
its
crisp
white
muslin
blinds
its
glimpses
of
neat
curtains
its
flowers
and
then
another
picture
came
to
him
he
saw
the
misty
last
light
fainting
beyond
the
great
shoulders
of
the
downs
and
the
little
starses
shining
so
bright
and
new
through
the
branches
of
fir
trees
that
interlaced
above
a
bed
of
soft
fallen
brown
what
say
mate
beale
repeated
and
dickie
answered
soon
as
ever
you
like
what
i
say
and
what
i
say
is
the
sooner
the
better
having
made
up
his
mind
to
go
beale
at
once
found
a
dozen
reasons
why
he
could
not
leave
home
and
all
the
reasons
were
and
wagged
loving
tails
at
him
he
was
anxious
in
fact
about
the
dogs
could
he
really
trust
amelia
dunno
oo
you
trust
then
said
amelia
tossing
a
still
handsome
head
anybody

the
dogs
was
babbies
to
hear
you

they
are
to
me
as
precious
as

bit
o
paper
for

what

to
to
eat
an
about
their
physic
and
which
of
to
have
what
this
took
some
time
to
settle
and
some
more
time
to
write
down
and
then
when
the
lick
of
paint
was
nearly
dry
on
the
perambulator
and
all
their
shirts
and
socks
were
washed
and
mended
and
lying
on
the
kitchen
ready
for
packing
what
did
beale
do
but
go
out
one
morning
and
come
back
with
a
perfectly
strange
dachshund
an
i
ca
go
and
leave
the
little
beast
till
he
knows
a
bit
in
noo
place
said
beale
an
boltin
off
gracious
knows
where
and
being
pinched
or
carted
off
to
the
dogs
home
or
that
can
i
now
the
new
dog
was
very
long
very
brown
very
friendly
and
charming
when
it
had
had
its
supper
it
wagged
its
tail
turned
a
clear
and
gentle
eye
on
dickie
and
without
any
warning
stood
on
its
head
well
said
beale
if
there
ai
money
in
that
beast
a
trick
dog
is
wuth
wot
i
give
for
so
is
knows
more
tricks
than
that
i
be
bound
he
did
he
was
a
singularly
dog
next
morning
beale
coming
was
just
in
time
to
bang
the
front
door
in
the
face
of
amelia
coming
in
from
doing
the
steps
and
this
to
prevent
the
flight
of
the
new
dog
the
door
of
one
of
the
was
open
and
a
fringe
of
inquisitive
dogs
ornamented
the
passage
what
you
open
that
door
at
all
for
beale
asked
amelia
i
did
she
said
and
stuck
to
it
that
afternoon
beale
smoking
in
the
garden
got
up
as
he
often
did
to
look
through
the
window
at
the
dogs
he
gazed
a
moment
muttered
something
and
made
one
jump
to
the
back
door
it
was
closed
amelia
was
giving
the
scullery
floor
a
thorough
scrub
over
and
had
fastened
the
door
to
avoid
having
it
opened
with
suddenness
against
her
steaming
pail
or
her
crouching
form
but
beale
got
in
at
the
and
out
at
the
front
just
in
time
to
see
the
dachshund
disappearing
at
full
speed
like
a
bit
of
brown
as
he
said
round
the
end
of
the
street
they
never
saw
that
dog
again
trained
to
it
beale
used
to
say
sadly
whenever
he
told
the
story
trained
to
it
from
a
pup
you
may
lay
your
life
i
see
as
plain
as
i
see
you
listens
an
looks
and
does
nor
see
nobody
an
ups
on
his
legs
and
turns
the
with
little
twisty
front
pawses
clever
as
a
monkey
and
hout
goes
like
a
harrow
in
a
bow
trained
to
it
ye
see
i
bet
his
master
wot
taught
that
sold
him
time
and
again
makin
a
good
figure
every
time
for
was
a
dawg
as
ever
i
see
trained
the
dawg
to
open
the
door
and
bunk
see
clever
i
call
it
it
a
mean
trick
said
dickie
when
beale
told
him
of
the
loss
of
the
dog
that
what
i
call
it
i
sorry
you
lost
the
dog
i
ai
exactly
pleased
myself
said
beale
but
no
use
crying
over
broken
glass
it
the
cleverness
i
think
of
most
he
said
admiringly
now
i
never
a
thought
of
a
thing
like
that
myself
not
if
i
lived
to
a
hundred
so
i
would
might
he
told
dickie
flatteringly
but
i
would
myself
we
do
need
to
said
dickie
hastily
we
earns
our
livings
we
need
to
cheat
to
get
our
livings
no
no
dear
boy
said
beale
more
hastily
still
course
we
do
that
just
what
i
ai
it
we
should
never
thought
o
that
no
need
to
as
you
say
the
cleverness
of
it
this
admiration
of
the
cleverness
by
which
he
himself
had
been
cheated
set
dickie
thinking
he
said
very
gently
and
quietly
after
a
little
pause
this
walking
tower
of
ours
we
pays
our
own
way
no
cadging
i
should
you
know
me
better
than
that
said
beale
virtuously
not
a
patter
have
i
done
since
i
done
the
rally
and
started
in
the
dog
line
nor
yet
no
dealings
with
that
redheaded
chap
what
i
never
see
now
is
it
likely
beale
asked
reproachfully
i
should
we
a
cut
above
a
low
chap
like
wot
is
the
pram
dry
as
a
bone
and
shiny
as
yer
and
we
start
the
first
thing
in
the
morning
and
in
the
early
morning
which
is
fresh
and
sweet
even
in
deptford
they
bade
farewell
to
amelia
and
the
dogs
and
set
out
amelia
watched
them
down
the
street
and
waved
a
farewell
as
they
turned
the
corner
it
be
a
bit
lonesome
she
said
one
thing
i
sha
be
burgled
with
all
them
dogs
in
the
house
the
voices
of
the
dogs
as
she
went
in
and
shut
the
door
seemed
to
assure
her
that
she
would
not
even
be
so
very
lonely
and
now
they
were
really
on
the
road
and
they
were
going
to
arden
to
that
place
by
the
sea
where
dickie
uncle
in
the
other
life
had
a
castle
and
where
dickie
was
to
meet
his
cousins
after
his
seven
months
of
waiting
you
may
think
that
dickie
would
be
very
excited
by
the
thought
of
meeting
in
this
workaday
nowadays
world
the
children
with
whom
he
had
had
such
wonderful
adventures
in
the
other
world
the
dream
world
too
excited
perhaps
to
feel
really
interested
in
the
little
happenings
of
the
road
but
this
was
not
so
the
present
was
after
all
the
real
thing
the
dreams
could
wait
the
knowledge
that
they
were
there
waiting
made
all
the
ordinary
things
more
beautiful
and
more
interesting
the
feel
of
the
soft
dust
underfoot
the
bright
dewy
grass
and
clover
by
the
wayside
the
lessening
of
houses
and
the
growing
wideness
of
field
and
pasture
all
contented
and
delighted
dickie
he
felt
to
the
full
all
the
joy
that
beale
felt
in
it
and
when
as
the
sun
was
sinking
they
overtook
a
bent
figure
it
was
with
a
thrill
of
real
pleasure
that
dickie
recognized
the
woman
who
had
given
him
the
blue
ribbon
for
true
true
himself
now
grown
large
and
thick
of
coat
seemed
to
recognize
a
friend
gambolled
round
her
dreadful
boots
sniffed
at
her
withered
hand
give
her
a
lift
with
her
basket
shall
us
dickie
whispered
to
beale
and
climbed
out
of
the
perambulator
i
can
make
shift
to
do
this
last
piece
so
the
three
went
on
together
in
friendly
silence
as
they
neared
orpington
the
woman
said
our
road
parts
here
and
thank
you
kindly
a
kindness
is
never
wasted
so
they
say
that
ai
nothing
said
beale
besides
there
the
blue
ribbon
that
the
dog
the
woman
asked
same
ole
dawg
said
beale
with
pride
a
pretty
beast
she
said
well
so
long
she
looked
back
to
smile
and
nod
to
them
when
she
had
taken
her
basket
and
the
turning
to
the
right
and
dickie
suddenly
stiffened
all
over
as
a
pointer
does
when
it
sees
a
partridge
i
say
he
cried
you
the
nurse
i
nursed
a
many
in
my
time
she
called
back
but
in
the
dream
you
know
dreams
is
queer
things
said
the
woman
and
she
added
least
said
is
soonest
mended
but
said
dickie
keep
your
eyes
open
and
your
mouth
shut
a
good
motto
said
she
nodded
again
and
turned
resolutely
away
not
very
civil
i
do
think
said
beale
considerin
oh
she
all
right
said
dickie
wondering
very
much
and
very
anxious
that
beale
should
not
wonder
may
i
ride
in
the
pram
farver
my
foot
a
bit
blistered
i
think
we
ai
done
so
much
lately
us
ai
tired
in
yourself
are
you
beale
asked
there
a
place
called
chevering
park
pretty
as
a
picture
i
thought
we
might
lay
out
there
i
a
bit
in
the
meself
but
i
can
stick
it
if
you
can
dickie
could
and
when
they
made
their
evening
camp
in
a
deep
gully
soft
with
and
he
looked
out
over
the
ridge
cautiously
because
of
keepers
at
the
smoothness
of
a
mighty
slope
in
the
dusk
where
rabbits
frisked
and
played
he
was
glad
that
he
had
not
yielded
to
his
tiredness
and
stopped
to
rest
the
night
anywhere
else
chevering
park
is
a
very
beautiful
place
i
would
have
you
to
know
and
the
travellers
were
lucky
the
dogs
were
good
and
quiet
and
no
keeper
disturbed
their
rest
or
their
masters
dickie
slept
with
true
in
his
arms
and
it
was
like
a
draught
of
soft
magic
elixir
to
lie
once
more
in
the
still
cool
night
and
look
up
at
the
stars
through
the
trees
ca
think
why
they
ever
invented
houses
he
said
and
then
he
fell
asleep
by
short
stages
enjoying
every
step
of
every
day
journey
they
went
slowly
and
at
their
ease
through
the
of
kent
dickie
loved
every
minute
of
it
every
leaf
in
the
hedge
every
blade
of
grass
by
the
roadside
and
most
of
all
he
loved
the
quiet
nights
when
he
fell
asleep
under
the
stars
with
true
in
his
arms
it
was
all
good
all
and
it
was
worth
waiting
and
working
for
seven
long
months
to
feel
the
thrill
that
dickie
felt
when
beale
as
they
topped
a
ridge
of
the
great
south
downs
said
suddenly
there
the
sea
and
a
dozen
yards
further
on
there
arden
castle
there
it
lay
gray
and
green
with
its
old
stones
and
ivy
the
same
castle
which
dickie
had
seen
on
the
day
when
they
lay
among
the
furze
bushes
and
waited
to
burgle
talbot
court
there
were
red
roofs
at
one
side
of
the
castle
where
a
house
had
been
built
among
the
ruins
as
they
drew
nearer
and
looked
down
at
arden
castle
dickie
saw
two
little
figures
in
its
green
courtyard
and
wondered
whether
they
could
possibly
be
edred
and
elfrida
the
little
cousins
whom
he
had
met
in
king
james
the
first
time
and
who
the
nurse
said
really
belonged
to
the
times
of
king
edward
the
seventh
or
nowadays
just
as
he
did
himself
it
seemed
as
though
it
could
hardly
be
true
but
if
it
were
true
how
splendid
what
games
he
and
they
could
have
and
what
a
it
was
that
spread
out
before
him
green
and
glorious
with
the
sea
on
one
side
and
the
downs
on
the
other
and
in
the
middle
the
ruins
of
arden
castle
but
as
they
went
on
through
the
furze
bushes
dickie
perceived
that
beale
was
growing
more
and
more
silent
and
uneasy
what
up
dickie
asked
at
last
out
with
it
farver
it
ai
nothing
said
beale
you
ai
afraid
those
talbots
will
know
you
again
not
much
i
ai
they
never
see
my
face
and
i
a
beard
that
time
like
what
i
got
now

dickie

just
the
not

to
make
me
mind
up
if

dickie

chance

dickie

if
it
was
me
remembrance
showed
him
the
father
who
had
leaned
on
his
shoulder
as
they
walked
about
the
winding
walks
of
the
pleasant
garden
in
old
deptford
the
father
who
had
given
him
the
little
horse
and
insisted
that
his
twenty
gold
pieces
should
be
spent
as
he
chose
i
dunno
said
beale
what
you
think
eh
matey
i
think
said
dickie
i
lay
if
he
alive
it
be
as
good
as
three
sundays
in
the
week
to
him
to
see
you
you
was
his
little
boy
once
was
you
ay
said
beale
he
was
wagoner
mate
to
one
of
lord
arden
men
used
to
ride
me
on
the
big
was
a
fine
chap
to
hear
the
name
of
arden
on
beale
lips
gave
dickie
a
very
odd
feeling
it
seemed
to
bring
certain
things
very
near
let
he
said
again
all
right
said
beale
only
if
it
all
goes
wrong
it
ai
my
fault
an
there
used
to
be
a
a
bit
further
on
you
cut
through
the
copse
and
cater
across
the
medder
and
bear
along
to
the
left
by
the
hedge
an
it
brings
you
out
under
arden
knoll
where
my
old
man
place
is
so
they
cut
and
catered
and
bore
along
and
came
out
under
arden
knoll
and
there
was
a
cottage
with
a
very
neat
garden
full
of
gay
flowers
and
a
brick
pathway
leading
from
the
wooden
gate
to
the
front
door
and
by
the
front
door
sat
an
old
man
in
a
windsor
chair
with
a
brown
spaniel
at
his
feet
and
a
bird
in
a
wicker
cage
above
his
head
and
he
was
nodding
for
it
was
a
hot
day
and
he
was
an
old
man
and
tired
swelp
me
i
ca
do
it
whispered
beale
i
walk
on
a
bit
you
just
arst
for
a
drink
and
sort
of
see
the
land
lays
it
might
turn
up
seeing
me
so
sudden
good
old
dad
he
walked
quickly
on
and
dickie
was
left
standing
by
the
gate
then
the
brown
spaniel
became
aware
of
true
and
barked
and
the
old
man
said
down
trusty
in
his
sleep
and
then
woke
up
his
clear
old
eyes
set
in
many
wrinkles
turned
full
on
dickie
by
the
gate
may
i
have
a
drink
of
water
dickie
asked
come
in
said
the
old
man
and
dickie
lifted
the
latch
of
smooth
brown
iron
and
went
up
the
brick
path
as
the
old
man
slowly
turned
himself
about
in
the
chair
yonder
the
well
he
said
draw
up
a
bucket
if
thy
leg
let
thee
poor
little
chap
i
draws
water
with
my
arms
not
my
legs
said
dickie
cheerfully
there
a
blue
mug
in
the
said
the
old
man
fetch
me
a
drop
when
you
had
your
drink
my
lad
of
course
dickie
manners
were
too
good
for
him
to
drink
first
he
drew
up
the
dripping
oaken
bucket
from
the
cool
darkness
of
the
well
fetched
the
mug
and
offered
it
brimming
to
the
old
man
then
he
drank
and
looked
at
the
garden
ablaze
with
flowers
and
damask
roses
and
and
candytuft
white
lilies
and
yellow
lilies
pansies
larkspur
poppies
bergamot
and
sage
it
was
just
like
a
play
at
the
greenwich
theatre
dickie
thought
he
had
seen
a
scene
just
like
that
where
the
old
man
sat
in
the
sun
and
the
prodigal
returned
dickie
would
not
have
been
surprised
to
see
beale
run
up
the
brick
path
and
throw
himself
on
his
knees
exclaiming
father
it
is
i
your
erring
but
repentant
son
can
you
forgive
me
if
a
lifetime
of
repentance
can
atone
and
so
on
if
dickie
had
been
beale
he
would
certainly
have
made
the
speech
beginning
father
it
is
i
but
as
he
was
only
dickie
he
said
your
name
beale
ai
it
it
might
be
old
beale
allowed
i
seen
your
son
in
london
told
me
about
yer
garden
i
should
a
thought
the
garden
same
as
forgot
me
said
the
old
man
ai
forgot
you
not
said
dickie
come
to
see
you
an
waiting
outside
now
to
know
if
you
like
to
see
then
oughter
know
better
said
the
old
man
and
shouted
in
a
thin
high
voice
jim
jim
come
along
in
this
minute
even
then
beale
did
act
a
bit
like
the
prodigal
in
the
play
he
just
unlatched
the
gate
without
looking
at
it
his
hand
had
not
forgotten
the
way
of
it
for
all
it
was
so
long
since
he
had
passed
through
that
gate
and
he
walked
slowly
and
heavily
up
the
path
and
said
hullo
dad
how
goes
it
and
the
old
man
looked
at
him
with
his
eyes
half
shut
and
said
why
it
james
so
it
is
as
if
he
had
expected
it
to
be
some
one
quite
different
and
they
shook
hands
and
then
beale
said
the
garden
looking
well
and
the
old
man
owned
that
the
garden
do
all
right
if
it
was
for
the
snails
that
was
all
dickie
heard
for
he
thought
it
polite
to
go
away
of
course
they
could
not
be
really
affectionate
with
a
stranger
about
so
he
shouted
from
the
gate
something
about
back
presently
and
went
off
along
the
cart
track
towards
arden
castle
and
looked
at
it
quite
closely
it
was
the
most
beautiful
and
interesting
thing
he
had
ever
seen
but
he
did
not
see
the
children
when
he
went
back
the
old
man
was
cooking
steak
over
the
kitchen
fire
and
beale
was
at
the
sink
straining
summer
cabbage
in
a
colander
as
though
he
had
lived
there
all
his
life
and
never
anywhere
else
he
was
in
his
too
and
his
coat
and
hat
hung
behind
the
so
then
they
had
dinner
when
the
old
man
had
set
down
the
expressly
to
shake
hands
with
dickie
saying
so
this
is
the
lad
you
told
me
about
yes
yes
it
was
a
very
nice
dinner
with
cold
gooseberry
pastry
as
well
as
the
steak
and
vegetables
the
kitchen
was
pleasant
and
cozy
though
rather
dark
on
account
of
the
white
climbing
rose
that
grew
round
the
window
after
dinner
the
men
sat
in
the
sun
and
smoked
and
dickie
occupied
himself
in
teaching
the
spaniel
and
true
that
neither
of
them
was
a
dog
who
deserved
to
be
growled
at
dickie
had
just
thrown
back
his
head
in
a
laugh
at
true
sulky
face
and
stiffly
planted
paws
when
he
felt
the
old
man
dry
wrinkled
hand
under
his
chin
let
a
look
at
you
he
said
and
peered
closely
at
the
child
where
you
get
that
face
eh
what
did
you
say
your
name
was
harding
his
name
said
beale
dickie
harding
dickie
i
should
if
you
asked
said
the
old
man
seems
to
me
it
a
arden
face
he
got
but
my
eyes
ai
so
good
as
wot
they
was
what
say
to
stopping
along
of
me
a
bit
my
boy
there
room
in
the
cottage
for
all
five
of
us
my
son
james
here
tells
me
you
been
good
as
a
son
to
him
i
love
it
said
dickie
so
that
was
settled
there
were
two
bedrooms
for
beale
and
his
father
and
dickie
slept
in
a
narrow
whitewashed
slip
of
a
room
that
had
once
been
a
larder
the
brown
spaniel
and
true
slept
on
the
rag
in
the
kitchen
and
everything
was
as
cozy
as
cozy
could
be
we
can
send
for
any
of
the
dawgs
any
minute
if
we
feel
we
ca
stick
it
without
said
beale
smoking
his
pipe
in
the
front
garden
you
mean
to
stay
a
long
time
then
said
dickie
i
dunno
you
see
i
was
born
and
bred
the
air
tastes
good
it
an
the
water
good
did
you
notice
the
tea
tasted
quite
different
from
what
it
does
anywhere
else
that
the
soft
water
that
is
an
the
old
chap
yes
and
there
one
or
two
other
things
yes
i
reckon
us
stop
on
a
bit
and
dickie
was
very
glad
for
now
he
was
near
arden
castle
and
could
see
it
any
time
that
he
chose
to
walk
a
couple
of
hundred
yards
and
look
down
and
presently
he
would
see
edred
and
elfrida
would
they
know
him
that
was
the
question
would
they
remember
that
he
and
they
had
been
cousins
and
friends
when
james
the
first
was
king
chapter
ix
kidnapped
and
now
new
cross
seemed
to
go
backwards
and
very
far
away
its
dirty
streets
its
sordid
shifts
its
crowds
of
anxious
unhappy
people
who
never
had
quite
enough
of
anything
and
dickie
home
was
in
a
pleasant
cottage
from
whose
windows
you
could
see
great
green
rolling
downs
and
the
smooth
silver
and
blue
of
the
sea
and
from
whose
door
you
stepped
not
on
to
filthy
pavements
but
on
to
a
neat
brick
path
leading
between
beds
glowing
with
flowers
also
he
was
near
arden
the
goal
of
seven
months
effort
now
he
would
see
edred
and
elfrida
again
and
help
them
to
find
the
hidden
treasure
as
he
had
once
helped
them
to
find
their
father
this
joyful
thought
put
the
crown
on
his
happiness
but
he
presently
perceived
that
though
he
was
so
close
to
arden
castle
he
did
not
seem
to
be
much
nearer
to
the
arden
children
it
is
not
an
easy
thing
to
walk
into
the
courtyard
of
a
ruined
castle
and
ring
the
bell
of
a
strange
house
and
ask
for
people
whom
you
have
only
met
in
dreams
or
as
good
as
dreams
and
i
do
know
how
dickie
would
have
managed
if
destiny
had
not
kindly
come
to
his
help
and
arranged
that
turning
a
corner
in
the
lane
which
leads
to
the
village
he
should
come
face
to
face
with
edred
and
elfrida
arden
and
they
looked
exactly
like
the
edred
and
elfrida
whom
he
had
played
with
and
quarrelled
with
in
the
dream
he
halted
leaning
on
his
crutch
for
them
to
come
up
and
speak
to
him
they
came
on
looking
hard
at
him
the
severe
might
have
called
it
staring
looked
came
up
to
him
and
passed
by
without
a
word
but
he
saw
them
talking
eagerly
to
each
other
dickie
was
left
in
the
lane
looking
after
them
it
was
a
miserable
moment
but
quite
quickly
he
roused
himself
they
were
talking
to
each
other
eagerly
and
once
elfrida
half
looked
round
perhaps
it
was
his
shabby
clothes
that
made
them
not
so
sure
whether
he
was
the
dickie
they
had
known
if
they
did
not
know
him
it
should
not
be
his
fault
he
balanced
himself
on
one
foot
beat
with
his
crutch
on
the
ground
and
shouted
hi
and
hullo
as
loud
as
he
could
the
other
children
turned
hesitated
and
came
back
what
is
it
the
little
girl
called
out
have
you
hurt
yourself
and
she
came
up
to
him
and
looked
at
him
with
kind
eyes
no
said
dickie
but
i
wanted
to
ask
you
something
the
other
two
looked
at
him
and
at
each
other
and
the
boy
said
righto
you
from
the
castle
are
you
he
said
i
was
wondering
whether
you
let
me
go
down
and
have
a
look
at
it
of
course
said
the
girl
come
on
wait
a
minute
said
dickie
nerving
himself
to
the
test
if
they
did
remember
him
they
think
he
was
mad
and
never
show
him
the
castle
never
mind
now
for
it
did
you
ever
have
a
tutor
called
mr
parados
he
asked
and
again
the
others
looked
at
him
and
at
each
other
for
short
dickie
hastened
to
add
and
did
you
ever
shovel
snow
on
to
his
head
and
then
ride
away
in
a
carriage
drawn
by
swans
it
you
cried
elfrida
and
hugged
him
edred
it
dickie
we
were
saying
it
be
you
oh
dickie
darling
how
did
you
hurt
your
foot
dickie
flushed
my
foot
always
been
like
that
he
said
in
nowadays
time
when
we
met
in
the
magic
times
i
was
like
everybody
else
i
elfrida
hugged
him
again
and
said
no
more
about
the
foot
instead
she
said
oh
how
ripping
it
is
to
really
and
truly
find
you
here
we
thought
you
could
be
real
because
we
wrote
a
letter
to
you
at
the
address
it
said
on
that
bill
you
gave
us
and
the
letter
came
back
with
known
outside
what
address
was
it
dickie
asked
laurie
grove
new
cross
edred
told
him
oh
that
was
just
an
address
beale
made
up
to
look
grand
with
said
dickie
i
remember
his
telling
me
about
it
he
the
man
i
live
with
i
call
him
father
because
he
been
kind
to
me
but
my
own
dead
let
go
up
on
the
downs
said
elfrida
and
sit
down
and
you
tell
us
all
about
everything
from
the
very
beginning
so
they
went
up
and
sat
among
the
furze
bushes
and
dickie
told
them
all
his
story
just
as
much
of
it
as
i
have
told
to
you
and
it
took
a
long
time
and
then
they
reminded
each
other
how
they
had
met
in
the
magic
or
dream
world
and
how
dickie
had
helped
them
to
save
their
father
which
he
did
do
only
i
have
not
had
time
to
tell
you
about
it
but
it
is
all
written
in
the
house
of
arden
but
our
magic
is
all
over
now
said
edred
sadly
we
had
to
give
up
ever
having
any
more
magic
so
as
to
get
father
back
and
now
we
shall
never
find
the
treasure
or
be
able
to
buy
back
the
old
lands
and
restore
the
castle
and
bring
the
water
back
to
the
moat
and
build
nice
dry
warm
cozy
cottages
for
the
tenants
but
we
got
father
well
but
look
here
said
dickie
we
got
magic
all
right
and
old
nurse
said
i
could
work
it
for
you
and
that
really
what
i
come
for
so
that
we
can
look
for
the
treasure
together
that
awfully
jolly
of
you
said
elfrida
what
is
your
magic
edred
asked
and
dickie
pulled
out
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
and
the
and
laid
them
on
the
turf
and
explained
and
in
the
middle
of
the
explanation
a
shadow
fell
on
the
children
and
the
tinkler
and
the
and
the
seal
and
there
was
a
big
handsome
gentleman
looking
down
at
them
and
saying
introduce
your
friend
edred
oh
dickie
this
is
my
father
cried
edred
scrambling
up
and
dickie
added
very
quickly
my
name
dick
harding
it
took
longer
for
dickie
to
get
up
because
of
the
crutch
and
lord
arden
reached
his
hand
down
to
help
him
he
must
have
been
a
little
surprised
when
the
crippled
child
in
the
shabby
clothes
stood
up
and
instead
of
touching
his
forehead
as
poor
children
are
taught
to
do
held
out
his
hand
and
said
how
do
you
do
lord
arden
i
am
very
well
i
thank
you
said
lord
arden
and
where
did
you
spring
from
you
are
not
a
native
of
these
parts
i
think
no
but
my
adopted
father
is
said
dickie
and
i
came
from
london
with
him
to
see
his
father
who
is
old
beale
and
we
are
staying
at
his
cottage
lord
arden
sat
down
beside
them
on
the
turf
and
asked
dickie
a
good
many
questions
about
where
he
was
born
and
who
he
had
lived
with
and
what
he
had
seen
and
done
and
been
dickie
answered
honestly
and
straightforwardly
only
of
course
he
did
not
tell
about
the
magic
or
say
that
in
that
magic
world
he
and
lord
arden
children
were
friends
and
cousins
and
all
the
time
they
were
talking
lord
arden
eyes
were
fixed
on
his
face
except
when
they
wandered
to
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
once
he
picked
these
up
and
looked
at
the
crest
on
them
where
did
you
get
these
he
asked
dickie
told
and
then
lord
arden
handed
the
seal
and
tinkler
to
him
and
went
on
with
his
questions
at
last
elfrida
put
her
arms
round
her
father
neck
and
whispered
i
know
it
not
manners
but
dickie
wo
mind
she
said
before
the
whispering
began
yes
certainly
said
lord
arden
when
the
whispering
was
over
dickie
you
come
home
to
tea
with
us
wo
you
i
must
tell
beale
said
dickie
he
be
anxious
if
i
do
shall
i
hurt
you
if
i
put
you
on
my
back
lord
arden
asked
and
next
minute
he
was
carrying
dickie
down
the
slope
towards
arden
castle
while
edred
went
back
to
beale
cottage
to
say
where
dickie
was
when
edred
got
back
to
arden
castle
tea
was
ready
in
the
parlor
and
dickie
was
resting
in
a
comfortable
chair
is
old
beale
a
funny
old
man
said
edred
he
said
arden
castle
was
the
right
place
for
dickie
with
a
face
like
that
what
could
he
have
meant
what
are
you
doing
that
for
he
added
in
injured
tones
for
elfrida
had
kicked
his
hand
under
the
table
before
tea
was
over
there
was
a
sound
of
horses
hoofs
and
carriage
wheels
in
the
courtyard
and
the
opened
the
parlor
door
and
said
lady
talbot
though
he
remembered
well
enough
how
kind
she
had
been
to
him
dickie
wished
he
could
creep
under
the
table
it
was
too
hard
she
must
recognize
him
and
now
edred
and
elfrida
and
lord
arden
who
was
so
kind
and
jolly
they
would
all
know
that
he
had
once
been
a
burglar
and
that
she
had
wanted
to
adopt
him
and
that
he
had
been
ungrateful
and
had
run
away
he
trembled
all
over
it
was
too
hard
lady
talbot
shook
hands
with
the
others
and
then
turned
to
him
and
who
is
your
little
friend
she
asked
edred
and
in
the
same
breath
cried
out
why
it
my
little
runaway
dickie
only
said
i
was
ungrateful
i
was
i
had
to
go
but
his
eyes
implored
and
lady
talbot
dickie
will
always
love
her
for
that
understood
not
a
word
about
burglars
did
she
say
only
i
wanted
to
adopt
dickie
once
lord
arden
but
he
would
not
stay
i
had
to
get
back
to
father
said
dickie
well
at
any
rate
it
pleasant
to
see
each
other
again
she
said
i
always
hoped
we
should
some
day
no
sugar
thank
you
elfrida
and
then
sat
down
and
had
tea
and
was
as
jolly
as
possible
the
only
thing
which
made
dickie
at
all
uncomfortable
was
when
she
turned
suddenly
to
the
master
of
the
house
and
said
does
he
remind
you
of
any
one
lord
arden
and
lord
arden
said
perhaps
he
does
with
that
sort
of
look
that
people
have
when
they
mean
not
before
the
children
i
rather
talk
about
it
afterwards
if
you
do
mind
then
the
three
were
sent
out
to
play
and
dickie
was
shown
the
castle
ruins
while
lord
arden
and
lady
talbot
walked
up
and
down
on
the
daisied
grass
and
talked
for
a
long
time
dickie
knew
they
were
talking
about
him
but
he
did
not
mind
he
had
that
feeling
you
sometimes
have
about
people
that
they
really
do
understand
and
are
to
be
trusted
you
be
too
fine
presently
to
speak
to
the
likes
of
us
you
nipper
said
beale
when
a
smart
little
pony
cart
had
brought
dickie
back
to
the
cottage
you
an
your
grand
friends
lord
arden
indeed
they
was
as
jolly
as
jolly
said
dickie
nobody
were
never
kinder
to
me
nor
what
lord
arden
was
an
lady
talbot
too
without
it
was
you
farver
ah
said
beale
to
the
old
man
knows
how
to
get
round
his
old
father
do
what
does
he
want
to
talk
that
way
for
the
old
man
asked
can
talk
like
a
little
gentleman
all
right
we
oh
that
the
way
we
talks
up
london
way
said
dickie
i
learned
to
talk
fine
out
o
books
beale
said
nothing
but
that
night
he
actually
read
for
nearly
ten
minutes
in
a
bound
volume
of
the
and
he
was
asleep
over
the
same
entertaining
work
when
lord
arden
came
the
next
afternoon
you
will
be
able
to
guess
what
he
came
about
and
dickie
had
a
sort
of
feeling
that
perhaps
lord
arden
might
have
seen
by
his
face
as
old
beale
had
that
he
was
an
arden
so
neither
he
nor
you
will
be
much
surprised
the
person
to
be
really
surprised
was
beale
you
might
me
down
with
a
pickaxe
said
beale
later
so
help
me
three
men
and
a
boy
you
might
it
a
rum
go
my
lord
says
some
woman
been
writing
letters
to
this
long
time
saying
she
got
of
nephew
or
cousin
or
something
and

nipper

so
there
an
end
of
you
and
me
dickie
old
boy
i
did
understand
more
than
of
wot

saying
but
i
tumbled
to
that
much
it
all
up
with
you
and
me
and
amelia
and
the
dogs
and
the
little
you
to
be
a
gentleman

and
be
a
poor
beast
of
a
cadger

to
i
know

yourself
about
said
dickie
calmly
i
ai
to
leave
yer
did
lady
talbot
ask
me
to
be
her
boy
and
did
i
cut
straight
back
to
you
i
play
along
o
them
kids
if
lord
arden
let
me
but
i
ai
to
leave
you
not
yet
i
ai
so
do
you
go
snivelling
afore
any
one
yer
farver
see
but
that
was
before
lord
arden
had
his
second
talk
with
beale
after
that
it
was
look
you
nipper
i
ai
to
stand
in
your
light
goin
up
in
the
world
says
you
well
you
ai
the
only
one
lord
arden
bought
father

an
goin
to
build
on
to
it
and
i
to
all
the
dawgs
down
and
sell
through
the
papers
like
and
you
come
an
a
look
at
us
sometimes
and
what
about
amelia
said
dickie
and
the
little
ones
well
i
did
think
said
beale
rubbing
his
nose
thoughtfully
of
asking
to
come
down
along
o
the
dawgs
seems
a
pity
to
separate
somehow
it
was
lord
arden
put
it
into
my
oughter
be
married
you
ought
says
to
me
pleasant
like
man
to
man
there
any
young
woman
i
could
give
a
trifle
to
to
set
you
and
her
up
in
housekeeping
so
then
i
casts
about
and
i
thinks
of
as
well
as
anybody
and
she
used
to
the
dawgs
and
the
trifle
an
hundred
pounds
that
all
all
so
i
sending
to
her
by
this
post
and
it
an
awful
toss
up
getting
married
but
ai
like
a
stranger
and
it
could
ever
be
the
same
with
us
two
and
nipper
after
all
this
set
out
what
you
say
i
do
know
what
dickie
said
what
he
felt
was
something
like
this
i
tried
to
stick
to
beale
and
help
him
along
and
i
did
come
back
from
the
other
old
world
to
help
him
and
i
have
been
sticking
to
things
i
did
like
so
as
to
help
him
and
get
him
settled
he
was
my
bit
of
work
and
now
some
one
else
comes
along
and
takes
my
work
out
of
my
hands
and
finishes
it
and
here
beale
provided
for
and
settled
and
i
meant
to
provide
for
him
myself
and
i
do
like
it
that
was
what
he
felt
at
first
but
afterwards
he
had
to
own
that
it
was
a
jolly
lucky
thing
for
beale
and
for
himself
too
he
found
that
to
be
at
arden
castle
with
edred
and
elfrida
all
day
at
play
and
at
lessons
was
almost
as
good
as
being
with
them
in
the
beautiful
old
all
the
things
that
he
had
hated
in
this
modern
life
when
he
was
dickie
of
deptford
ceased
to
trouble
him
now
that
he
was
richard
arden
for
the
difference
between
being
rich
and
poor
is
as
great
as
the
difference
between
being
warm
and
cold
after
that
first
day
a
sort
of
shyness
came
over
the
three
children
and
they
spoke
no
more
of
the
strange
adventures
they
had
had
together
but
just
played
at
all
the
ordinary
games
till
they
almost
forgot
that
there
was
any
magic
had
ever
been
any
the
fact
was
the
life
they
were
leading
was
so
happy
in
itself
that
they
needed
no
magic
to
make
them
contented
it
was
not
till
after
the
wedding
of
and
beale
that
dickie
remembered
that
to
find
the
arden
treasure
for
his
cousins
had
been
one
of
his
reasons
for
coming
back
to
this
the
nowadays
world
i
wish
i
had
time
to
tell
you
about
the
wedding
i
could
write
a
whole
book
about
it
how
amelia
came
down
from
london
and
was
married
in
arden
church
how
she
wore
a
white
dress
and
a
large
hat
with
a
wreath
of
orange
blossoms
a
filmy
veil
and
real
kid
gloves
all
gifts
of
miss
edith
arden
lord
arden
sister
how
lord
arden
presented
an
enormous
wedding
cake
and
a
glorious
wedding
breakfast
and
gave
away
the
bride
and
made
a
speech
saying
he
owed
a
great
debt
to
beale
for
his
kindness
to
his
nephew
richard
arden
and
how
surprised
every
one
was
to
hear
dickie
new
name
how
all
the
dogs
wore
white
favors
and
had
each
a
crumb
of
wedding
cake
and
how
when
the
wedding
feast
was
over
and
the
guests
gone
the
bride
tucked
up
her
white
dress
under
a
big
apron
and
set
about
arranging
in
the
new
rooms
the
sticks
of
furniture
which
dickie
and
beale
had
brought
together
from
the
little
home
in
deptford
and
which
had
come
in
a
van
by
road
all
the
way
to
arden
the
ardens
had
gone
back
to
the
castle
and
dickie
with
them
and
old
beale
was
smoking
in
his
usual
chair
by
his
front
door
so
there
was
no
one
to
hear
beale
compliment
to
his
bride
he
came
behind
her
and
put
his
arm
round
her
as
she
was
dusting
the
mantelpiece
go
on
with
you
said
the
new
beale
any
one
think
we
was
courting
so
we
be
said
beale
and
kissed
for
the
first
time
we
got
all
our
courtin
to
do
now
see
i
might
an
choosed
he
added
reflectively
but
there
i
dare
say
i
might
worse
blushed
with
pleasure
at
the
compliment
and
went
on
with
the
dusting
it
was
as
the
ardens
walked
home
over
the
short
turf
that
lord
arden
said
to
his
sister
i
wish
all
the
cottages
about
here
were
like
beale
it
did
cost
so
very
much
if
i
could
only
buy
back
the
rest
of
the
land
i
show
some
people
what
a
model
village
is
like
only
i
ca
buy
it
back
he
wants
far
more
than
we
can
think
of
managing
and
dickie
heard
what
he
said
that
was
why
when
next
he
was
alone
with
his
cousins
he
began
look
here
you
are
allowed
to
use
your
magic
any
more
to
go
and
look
for
the
treasure
but
am
and
i
vote
we
go
and
look
for
it
and
then
your
father
can
buy
back
the
old
lands
and
build
the
new
cottages
and
mend
up
arden
castle
and
make
it
like
it
used
to
be
oh
let
said
elfrida
with
enthusiasm
but
edred
unexpectedly
answered
i
do
know
the
three
children
were
sitting
in
the
window
of
the
looking
down
on
the
green
turf
of
the
castle
yard
what
do
you
mean
you
do
know
elfrida
asked
briskly
i
i
do
know
said
edred
stolidly
we
all
right
as
we
are
think
i
used
to
think
i
liked
magic
and
things
but
if
you
come
to
think
of
it
something
horrid
happened
to
us
every
single
time
we
went
into
the
past
with
our
magic
we
were
always
being
chased
or
put
in
prison
or
bothered
somehow
or
other
the
only
really
nice
thing
was
when
we
saw
the
treasure
being
hidden
because
that
looked
like
a
picture
and
we
had
to
do
anything
and
we
do
know
where
the
treasure
is
anyhow
and
i
do
like
adventures
nearly
so
much
as
i
used
to
think
i
did
we
all
right
and
jolly
as
we
are
what
i
say
is
let
this
cold
water
damped
the
spirit
of
the
others
only
for
a
few
minutes
you
know
elfrida
explained
to
dickie
our
magic
took
us
to
look
for
treasure
in
the
past
and
once
a
film
of
a
photograph
that
we
stuck
up
behaved
like
a
cinematograph
and
then
we
saw
the
treasure
being
hidden
away
then
let
just
go
where
that
was
mark
the
spot
come
home
and
then
dig
it
up
it
was
buried
elfrida
explained
it
was
put
into
a
sort
of
cellar
with
doors
and
we
looked
all
over
what
left
of
the
castle
and
there
is
so
much
as
a
teeny
silver
ring
to
be
found
i
see
said
dickie
but
suppose
i
just
worked
the
magic
and
wished
to
be
where
the
treasure
is
i
wo
cried
edred
and
in
his
extreme
dislike
to
the
idea
he
kicked
with
his
boots
quite
violently
against
the
stones
of
the
tower
not
much
i
wo
i
expect
the
treasure
bricked
up
we
should
look
nice
bricked
up
in
a
vault
like
a
wicked
nun
and
perhaps
forgotten
the
way
to
get
out
not
much
you
need
make
such
a
fuss
about
it
said
elfrida
nobody
going
to
get
bricked
up
in
vaults
and
dickie
added
you
quite
right
old
chap
i
did
think
about
that
we
must
do
elfrida
said
impatiently
how
would
it
be
dickie
spoke
slowly
if
i
tried
to
see
the
mouldierwarp
he
is
stronger
than
the
mouldiwarp
he
might
advise
us
suppose
we
work
the
magic
and
just
ask
to
see
him
i
do
want
to
go
away
from
here
said
edred
firmly
you
need
i
lay
out
the
and
things
on
the
floor
here
you
see
so
dickie
made
the
crossed
triangles
of
and
he
and
his
cousins
stood
in
it
and
dickie
said
please
can
we
see
the
mouldierwarp
just
as
you
say
please
can
i
see
mr
when
you
have
knocked
at
the
door
of
house
and
some
one
has
opened
the
door
immediately
everything
became
dark
but
before
the
children
had
time
to
wish
that
it
was
light
again
a
disc
of
light
appeared
on
the
curtain
of
darkness
and
there
was
the
mouldierwarp
just
as
dickie
had
seen
him
once
before
he
bowed
in
a
courtly
manner
and
said
what
can
i
do
for
you
richard
lord
arden
he
not
lord
arden
said
edred
used
to
be
but
even
not
lord
arden
now
my
father
is
indeed
said
the
mouldierwarp
with
an
air
of
polite
interest
you
interest
me
greatly
but
my
question
remains
unanswered
i
want
said
dickie
to
find
the
lost
treasure
of
arden
so
that
the
old
castle
can
be
built
up
again
and
the
old
lands
bought
back
and
the
old
cottages
made
pretty
and
good
to
live
in
will
you
please
advise
me
the
mouldierwarp
in
the
picture
seemed
to
scratch
his
nose
thoughtfully
with
his
fore
paw
it
can
be
done
he
said
but
it
will
be
hard
it
is
almost
impossible
to
find
the
treasure
without
waking
the
mouldiestwarp
who
sits
on
the
checkered
field
of
ardens
shield
of
arms
and
he
can
only
be
awakened
by
some
noble
deed
yet
noble
deeds
may
chance
at
any
time
and
if
you
go
to
seek
treasure
of
one
kind
you
may
find
treasure
of
another
i
have
spoken
it
began
to
fade
away
but
elfrida
cried
oh
go
you
just
like
the
greek
oracles
wo
you
tell
us
something
plain
and
straightforward
i
will
said
the
mouldierwarp
rather
shortly
great
arden
lord
no
treasure
shall
regain
till
arden
lord
is
lost
and
found
again
and
father
lost
and
found
again
said
edred
so
that
all
right
set
forth
to
seek
it
with
courageous
face
and
seek
it
in
the
most
unlikely
place
and
with
that
it
vanished
altogether
and
the
darkness
with
it
and
there
were
the
three
children
and
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
and
the
and
the
sunshine
on
the
floor
of
the
room
in
the
tower
that
useful
said
edred
scornfully
as
if
it
was
just
as
difficult
to
know
the
unlikely
places
as
the
likely
ones
i
tell
you
what
said
dickie
and
then
the
dinner
bell
rang
and
they
had
to
go
without
dickie
telling
them
what
and
to
eat
roast
mutton
and
and
behave
as
though
they
were
just
ordinary
children
to
whom
no
magic
had
ever
happened
there
was
little
chance
of
more
talk
that
day
edred
and
elfrida
were
to
be
taken
to
cliffville
immediately
after
dinner
to
be
measured
for
new
shoes
and
dickie
was
to
go
up
to
spend
the
afternoon
with
beale
and
and
the
dogs
still
in
the
few
moments
when
they
were
all
dressed
and
waiting
for
the
to
come
round
dickie
found
a
chance
to
whisper
to
elfrida
let
all
think
of
unlikely
places
as
hard
as
ever
we
can
and
we
decide
on
the
unlikeliest
and
go
there
edred
need
be
in
it
if
he
does
want
to
keen
are
you
rather
was
all
there
was
time
for
elfrida
to
say
the
welcome
that
awaited
dickie
at
beale
cottage
from
beale
amelia
and
not
least
the
dogs
was
enough
to
drive
all
thoughts
of
unlikely
places
out
of
anybody
head
and
besides
there
were
always
so
many
interesting
things
to
do
at
the
cottage
he
helped
to
wash
true
cleaned
the
knives
and
rinsed
lettuce
for
tea
helped
to
dry
the
and
to
fold
the
washing
when
beale
brought
it
in
out
of
the
yard
in
dry
sweet
armfuls
of
white
folds
it
was
dusk
when
he
bade
them
embracing
each
dog
in
turn
and
set
out
to
walk
the
little
way
to
the
crossroads
where
the
returning
from
cliffville
would
pick
him
up
but
the
was
a
little
late
because
the
pony
had
dropped
a
shoe
and
had
had
to
be
taken
to
the
blacksmith
so
when
dickie
had
waited
a
little
while
he
began
to
think
as
one
always
does
when
people
do
keep
their
appointments
that
perhaps
he
had
mistaken
the
time
or
that
the
clock
at
the
cottage
was
slow
and
when
he
had
waited
a
little
longer
it
seemed
simply
silly
to
be
waiting
at
all
so
he
picked
up
his
crutch
and
got
up
from
the
milestone
where
he
had
been
sitting
and
set
off
to
walk
down
to
the
castle
as
he
went
he
thought
many
things
and
one
of
the
things
he
thought
was
that
the
memories
of
king
james
time
had
grown
dim
and
distant
he
looked
down
on
arden
castle
and
loved
it
and
felt
that
he
asked
no
better
than
to
live
there
all
his
life
with
his
cousins
and
their
father
and
that
after
all
the
magic
of
a
was
not
needed
when
life
itself
was
so
good
and
happy
and
just
as
he
was
thinking
this
a
twig
cracked
sharply
in
the
hedge
then
a
dozen
twigs
rustled
and
broke
and
something
like
a
great
black
bird
seemed
to
fly
out
at
him
and
fold
him
in
its
wings
it
was
not
a
bird
he
knew
that
the
next
moment
but
a
big
dark
cloak
that
some
one
had
thrown
over
his
head
and
shoulders
and
through
it
strong
hands
were
holding
him
hold
yer
noise
said
a
voice
if
you
so
much
as
squeak
it
be
the
worse
for
you
help
shouted
dickie
instantly
he
was
thrown
on
to
the
ground
hands
fumbled
his
face
was
cleared
of
the
cloak
and
a
handkerchief
with
a
round
pebble
in
it
was
stuffed
into
his
mouth
so
that
he
could
not
speak
then
he
was
dragged
behind
a
hedge
and
held
there
while
two
voices
whispered
above
him
the
cloak
was
over
his
head
again
now
and
he
could
see
nothing
but
he
could
hear
he
heard
one
of
the
voices
say
hush
they
coming
and
then
he
heard
the
sound
of
hoofs
and
wheels
and
lord
arden
jolly
voice
saying
he
must
have
walked
on
we
shall
catch
him
up
all
right
then
the
sound
of
wheels
and
hoofs
died
away
and
hard
hands
pulled
him
to
his
feet
and
thrust
the
crutch
under
his
arm
step
out
said
one
of
the
voices
and
step
out
sharp
see
or
you
there
a
carriage
awaiting
for
you
he
stepped
out
there
was
nothing
else
to
be
done
they
had
taken
the
cloak
from
his
eyes
now
and
he
saw
presently
that
they
were
nearing
a
coster
barrow
they
laid
him
in
the
barrow
covered
him
with
the
cloak
and
put
vegetable
marrows
and
cabbages
on
that
they
only
left
him
a
little
room
to
breathe
now
lie
still
for
your
life
said
the
second
voice
if
you
stir
a
inch
i
lick
you
till
you
ca
stand
and
now
you
know
so
he
lay
still
rigid
with
misery
and
despair
for
neither
of
these
voices
was
strange
to
him
he
knew
them
both
only
too
well
chapter
x
the
noble
deed
when
lord
arden
and
elfrida
and
edred
reached
the
castle
and
found
that
dickie
had
not
come
back
the
children
concluded
that
beale
had
persuaded
him
to
stay
the
night
at
the
cottage
and
lord
arden
thought
that
the
children
must
be
right
he
was
extremely
annoyed
both
with
beale
and
with
dickie
for
making
such
an
arrangement
without
consulting
him
it
is
impertinent
of
beale
and
thoughtless
of
the
boy
he
said
and
i
shall
speak
a
word
to
them
both
in
the
morning
but
when
edred
and
elfrida
were
gone
to
bed
lord
arden
found
that
he
could
not
feel
quite
sure
or
quite
satisfied
suppose
dickie
was
not
at
beale
he
strolled
up
to
the
cottage
to
see
everything
was
dark
at
the
cottage
he
hesitated
then
knocked
at
the
door
at
the
third
knock
beale
very
sleepy
put
his
head
out
of
the
window
who
there
said
he
i
am
here
said
lord
arden
richard
is
asleep
i
suppose
i
suppose
so
my
lord
said
beale
sleepy
and
puzzled
you
have
given
me
some
anxiety
i
had
to
come
up
to
make
sure
he
was
here
but
said
beale
did
you
pick
up
with
the
same
as
you
said
you
would
no
shouted
lord
arden
come
down
beale
and
get
a
lantern
there
must
have
been
an
accident
the
bedroom
window
showed
a
square
of
light
and
lord
arden
below
heard
beale
blundering
about
above
your
coat
beale
voice
sounded
never
mind
lacing
up
of
your
boots
you
orter
gone
a
bit
of
the
way
with
well
i
offered
for
to
go
did
i
beale
growled
blundered
down
the
stairs
and
out
through
the
and
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
with
a
stable
lantern
in
his
hand
he
came
close
to
where
lord
arden
stood
a
tall
dark
figure
in
the
starlight
and
spoke
in
a
voice
that
trembled
the
little
nipper
he
said
and
again
the
little
nipper
if
anything
happened
to
swelp
me
my
lord
i
mean
what
i
meanter
say
if
anything
to
one
of
the
best
the
two
men
went
quickly
towards
the
gate
as
they
passed
down
the
quiet
dusty
road
beale
spoke
again
i
was
no
good
i
do
deceive
you
a
no
account
man
i
was
swelp
me
and
the
little
tidied
me
up
and
told
me
tales
and
kep
me
straight
it
was
doing
me
and
come
together
an
the
dogs
an
all
an
the
little
one
an
got
me
to
chuck
the
cadgin
an
worse
do
know
what
i
was
like
when
i
met
why
i
set
out
to
make
a
blighted
burglar
of
you
would
believe
and
out
the
whole
story
came
as
lord
arden
and
he
went
along
the
gray
road
looking
to
right
and
left
where
no
bushes
were
nor
stones
only
the
smooth
curves
of
the
down
so
that
it
was
easy
to
see
that
no
little
boy
was
there
either
they
looked
for
dickie
to
right
and
left
and
here
and
there
under
bushes
and
by
stiles
and
hedges
and
with
trembling
hearts
they
searched
in
the
little
old
chalk
quarry
and
the
white
moon
came
up
very
late
to
help
them
but
they
did
not
find
him
though
they
roused
a
dozen
men
in
the
village
to
join
in
the
search
and
old
beale
himself
who
knew
every
yard
of
the
ground
for
five
miles
round
came
out
with
the
spaniel
who
knew
every
inch
of
it
for
ten
but
true
rushed
about
the
house
and
garden
whining
and
yelping
so
piteously
that
tied
him
up
and
he
stayed
tied
up
and
so
when
edred
and
elfrida
came
down
to
breakfast
honeysett
met
them
with
the
news
that
dickie
was
lost
and
their
father
still
out
looking
for
him
it
that
beastly
magic
said
edred
as
soon
as
the
children
were
alone
he
done
it
once
too
often
and
he
got
stuck
some
time
in
history
and
ca
get
back
and
we
ca
do
anything
we
ca
get
to
him
said
elfrida
oh
if
only
we
got
the
old
white
magic
and
the
mouldiwarp
to
help
us
we
could
find
out
what
become
of
him
perhaps
he
has
fallen
down
a
disused
mine
edred
suggested
and
is
lying
panting
for
water
and
his
faithful
dog
has
jumped
down
after
him
and
broken
all
its
dear
legs
elfrida
melted
to
tears
at
this
desperate
picture
melted
to
a
speechless
extent
we
ca
do
anything
said
edred
again
do
snivel
like
that
for
goodness
sake
elfrida
this
is
a
man
job
dry
up
i
ca
think
with
you
blubbing
like
that
i
not
said
elfrida
untruly
and
sniffed
with
some
intensity
if
you
could
make
up
some
poetry
now
edred
went
on
would
that
be
any
good
not
without
the
dresses
she
sniffed
you
know
we
always
had
dresses
for
our
magic
or
nearly
always
and
they
have
to
be
dead
and
gone
people
dresses
and
you
only
go
to
the
dead
and
gone
people
time
when
the
dresses
were
worn
oh
dear
dickie
and
if
he
really
down
a
mine
or
things
like
that
what
the
good
of
anything
i
going
to
try
anyway
said
edred
at
least
you
must
too
because
i
ca
make
poetry
no
more
can
i
when
i
as
unhappy
as
this
poetry
the
last
thing
you
think
of
when
you
mizzy
we
could
dress
up
anyway
said
edred
hopefully
the
bits
of
armor
out
of
the
hall
and
the
indian
feather
father
brought
home
and
i
have
father
and
brown
paper
tops
and
you
can
have
aunt
edith
roman
sash
it
in
the
corner
drawer
i
saw
it
on
the
wedding
day
when
i
went
to
get
her
i
do
want
to
dress
up
said
elfrida
i
want
to
find
dickie
i
do
want
to
dress
up
either
said
edred
but
we
must
do
something
and
perhaps
i
know
it
just
only
perhaps
it
might
help
if
we
dressed
up
let
try
it
anyway
elfrida
was
too
miserable
to
argue
before
long
two
most
miserable
children
faced
each
other
in
edred
bedroom
dressed
as
red
indians
so
far
as
their
heads
and
backs
went
then
came
lots
of
plate
armor
for
chest
and
arms
then
in
the
case
of
elfrida
petticoats
and
roman
sash
and
japanese
wickerwork
shoes
and
father
made
to
look
like
boots
by
brown
paper
tops
and
in
the
case
of
edred
legs
cased
in
armor
that
looked
like
cricket
pads
ending
in
jointed
that
looked
like
chrysalises
i
am
told
the
correct
plural
is
chrysalides
but
life
would
be
dull
indeed
if
one
always
used
the
correct
plural
they
were
two
forlorn
faces
that
looked
at
each
other
as
edred
said
now
the
poetry
i
ca
said
elfrida
bursting
into
tears
again
i
so
there
i
been
trying
all
the
time
we
been
dressing
and
i
can
only
think
of
oh
call
dear
dickie
back
to
me
i
can
not
play
alone
the
summer
comes
with
flower
and
bee
where
is
dear
dickie
gone
and
i
know
that
no
use
i
should
think
not
said
edred
why
it
is
your
own
poetry
at
all
it
felicia
hemans
i
try
and
he
got
a
pencil
and
paper
and
try
he
did
his
very
hardest
be
sure
but
there
are
some
things
that
the
best
and
bravest
can
not
do
and
the
thing
edred
could
do
was
to
make
poetry
however
bad
he
simply
could
do
it
any
more
than
you
can
fly
it
was
in
him
any
more
than
wings
are
on
you
oh
mouldiwarp
you
said
we
must
not
have
any
more
magic
but
we
trust
you
wo
be
hard
on
us
because
dickie
is
lost
and
we
do
know
how
to
find
him
that
was
the
best
edred
could
do
and
i
tell
it
to
his
credit
he
really
did
feel
doubtful
whether
what
he
had
so
slowly
and
carefully
written
was
indeed
genuine
poetry
so
much
so
that
he
would
not
show
it
to
elfrida
until
she
had
begged
very
hard
indeed
at
about
the
thirtieth
do
please
edred
do
he
gave
her
the
paper
no
little
girl
was
ever
more
polite
than
elfrida
or
less
anxious
to
hurt
the
feelings
of
others
but
she
was
also
quite
truthful
and
when
edred
said
in
an
ashamed
muffled
voice
is
it
all
right
do
you
think
the
best
she
could
find
by
way
of
answer
was
i
do
know
much
about
poetry
we
try
it
and
they
did
try
it
and
nothing
happened
i
knew
it
was
no
good
edred
said
crossly
and
i
made
an
ass
of
myself
for
nothing
well
i
often
made
one
of
myself
said
elfrida
comfortingly
and
i
will
again
if
you
like
but
i
do
suppose
it
be
any
more
good
than
yours
elfrida
frowned
fiercely
and
the
feathers
on
her
indian
quivered
with
the
intensity
of
her
effort
is
it
coming
edred
asked
in
anxious
tones
and
she
nodded
distractedly
great
mouldiestwarp
on
you
we
call
to
do
the
greatest
magic
of
all
to
show
us
how
we
are
to
find
dear
dickie
who
is
lame
and
kind
do
this
for
us
and
on
our
hearts
we
swore
we
never
ask
you
for
anything
more
i
do
see
that
it
so
much
better
than
mine
said
edred
and
it
ought
to
be
not
i
do
think
it
is
but
you
did
finish
yours
and
it
could
be
because
of
rhyming
elfrida
explained
but
i
sure
if
the
mouldiestwarp
hears
it
he
wo
care
tuppence
whether
it
swear
or
swore
he
is
much
too
great
he
far
above
grammar
i
sure
i
wish
every
one
was
sighed
edred
and
i
dare
say
you
have
often
felt
the
same
well
fire
away
not
that
it
any
good
do
you
remember
you
can
only
get
at
the
mouldiestwarp
by
a
noble
deed
and
wanting
to
find
dickie
is
noble
no
she
agreed
but
then
if
we
could
get
dickie
back
by
doing
a
noble
deed
we
do
it
like
a
shot
would
we
oh
i
suppose
so
said
edred
grumpily
fire
away
ca
you
elfrida
fired
away
and
the
next
moment
it
was
plain
that
poetry
was
more
potent
than
edred
also
that
a
little
bad
grammar
is
a
trifle
to
a
mighty
mouldiwarp
for
the
walls
of
edred
room
receded
further
and
further
till
the
children
found
themselves
in
a
great
white
hall
with
avenues
of
tall
pillars
stretching
in
every
direction
as
far
as
you
could
see
the
hall
was
crowded
with
people
dressed
in
costumes
of
all
countries
and
all
ages
chinamen
indians
crusaders
in
armor
powdered
ladies
doubleted
gentlemen
cavaliers
in
curls
turks
in
turbans
arabs
monks
abbesses
jesters
grandees
with
ruffs
round
their
necks
and
savages
with
kilts
of
thatch
every
kind
of
dress
you
can
think
of
was
there
only
all
the
dresses
were
white
it
was
like
a
which
is
a
ball
where
the
guests
may
wear
any
dress
they
choose
only
all
the
dresses
must
be
of
one
color
elfrida
saw
the
whiteness
all
about
her
and
looked
down
anxiously
at
her
clothes
and
edred
which
she
remembered
to
have
been
of
rather
odd
colors
everything
they
wore
was
white
now
even
the
roman
sash
instead
of
having
stripes
blue
and
red
and
green
and
black
and
yellow
was
of
five
different
shades
of
white
if
you
think
there
are
not
so
many
shades
of
white
try
to
paper
a
room
with
white
paper
and
get
it
at
five
different
shops
the
people
round
the
children
pushed
them
gently
forward
and
then
they
saw
that
in
the
middle
of
the
hall
was
a
throne
of
silver
spread
with
a
fringed
cloth
of
checkered
silver
and
green
and
on
it
with
the
mouldiwarp
standing
on
one
side
and
the
mouldierwarp
on
the
other
the
mouldiestwarp
was
seated
in
state
and
splendor
he
was
much
larger
than
either
of
the
other
moles
and
his
fur
was
as
silvery
as
the
feathers
of
a
swan
every
one
in
the
room
was
looking
at
the
two
children
and
it
seemed
impossible
for
them
not
to
advance
though
slowly
and
shyly
right
to
the
front
of
the
throne
arrived
there
it
seemed
right
to
bow
very
low
so
they
did
it
then
the
mouldiwarp
said
what
brings
you
here
kind
magic
elfrida
answered
and
the
mouldierwarp
said
what
is
your
desire
and
edred
said
we
want
dickie
please
then
the
mouldiestwarp
said
and
it
was
to
edred
that
he
said
it
dickie
is
in
the
hands
of
those
who
will
keep
him
from
you
for
many
a
day
unless
you
yourself
go
alone
and
rescue
him
it
will
be
difficult
and
it
will
be
dangerous
will
you
go
me
alone
said
edred
rather
blankly
not
elfrida
dickie
can
only
be
ransomed
at
a
great
price
and
it
must
be
paid
by
you
it
will
cost
you
more
to
do
it
than
it
would
cost
elfrida
because
she
is
braver
than
you
are
here
was
a
nice
thing
for
a
boy
to
have
said
to
him
and
before
all
these
people
too
to
ask
a
chap
to
do
a
noble
deed
and
in
the
same
breath
to
tell
him
he
is
a
coward
edred
flushed
crimson
and
a
shudder
ran
through
the
company
do
turn
that
horrible
color
whispered
a
white
toreador
who
was
close
to
him
this
is
the
world
no
crimson
allowed
elfrida
caught
edred
hand
edred
is
quite
as
brave
as
me
she
said
he
go
wo
you
of
course
i
will
said
edred
impatiently
then
ascend
the
steps
of
the
throne
said
the
mouldiestwarp
very
kindly
now
and
sit
here
by
my
side
edred
obeyed
and
the
mouldiestwarp
leaned
towards
him
and
spoke
in
his
ear
so
that
neither
elfrida
nor
any
of
the
great
company
in
the
white
hall
could
hear
a
word
only
edred
alone
if
you
go
to
rescue
richard
arden
the
mouldiestwarp
said
you
make
the
greatest
sacrifice
of
your
life
for
he
who
was
called
richard
harding
is
richard
arden
and
it
is
he
who
is
lord
arden
and
not
you
or
your
father
and
if
you
go
to
his
rescue
you
will
be
taking
from
your
father
the
title
and
the
castle
and
you
will
be
giving
up
your
place
as
heir
of
arden
to
your
cousin
richard
who
is
the
rightful
heir
but
how
is
he
the
rightful
heir
edred
asked
bewildered
three
generations
ago
said
the
mouldiestwarp
a
little
baby
was
stolen
from
arden
death
came
among
the
ardens
and
that
child
became
the
heir
to
the
name
and
the
lands
of
arden
the
man
who
stole
the
child
took
it
to
a
woman
in
deptford
and
gave
it
in
charge
to
her
to
nurse
she
knew
nothing
but
that
the
child
clothes
were
marked
arden
and
that
it
had
tied
to
its
waist
a
coral
and
bells
engraved
with
a
coat
of
arms
the
man
who
had
stolen
the
child
said
he
would
return
in
a
month
he
never
returned
he
fought
in
a
duel
and
was
killed
but
the
night
before
the
duel
he
wrote
a
letter
saying
what
he
had
done
and
put
it
in
a
secret
cupboard
behind
a
picture
of
a
lady
who
was
born
an
arden
at
talbot
court
and
there
that
letter
is
to
this
day
i
hope
i
sha
forget
it
all
said
edred
none
ever
forgets
what
i
tell
them
said
the
mouldiestwarp
finding
that
the
man
did
not
return
the
deptford
woman
brought
up
the
child
as
her
own
he
grew
up
was
taught
a
trade
and
married
a
working
girl
the
name
of
arden
changed
itself
as
names
do
to
harding
their
child
was
the
father
of
richard
whom
you
know
and
he
is
lord
arden
yes
said
edred
submissively
you
will
never
tell
your
father
this
the
low
beautiful
voice
went
on
you
must
not
even
tell
your
sister
till
you
have
rescued
dickie
and
made
the
sacrifice
this
is
the
one
supreme
chance
of
all
your
life
every
soul
has
one
such
chance
a
chance
to
be
perfectly
unselfish
absolutely
noble
and
true
you
can
take
this
chance
but
you
must
take
it
alone
no
one
can
help
you
no
one
can
advise
you
and
you
must
keep
the
nobler
thought
in
your
own
heart
till
it
is
a
noble
deed
then
humbly
and
thankfully
in
that
you
have
been
permitted
to
do
so
fine
and
brave
a
thing
and
to
draw
near
to
the
immortals
of
all
ages
who
have
such
deeds
to
do
and
have
done
them
you
may
tell
the
truth
to
the
one
who
loves
you
best
your
sister
elfrida
but
is
elfrida
to
have
a
chance
to
be
noble
too
edred
asked
she
will
have
a
thousand
chances
to
be
good
and
noble
and
she
will
take
them
all
but
she
will
never
know
that
she
has
done
it
said
the
mouldiestwarp
gravely
now
are
you
ready
to
do
what
is
to
be
done
it
seems
very
unkind
to
daddy
said
edred
stopping
his
being
lord
arden
and
everything
to
do
right
often
seems
unkind
to
one
or
another
said
the
mouldiestwarp
but
think
how
long
would
your
father
wish
to
keep
his
house
and
his
castle
if
he
knew
that
they
belonged
to
some
one
else
i
see
said
edred
still
doubtfully
no
of
course
he
would
well
what
am
i
to
do
when
dickie
father
died
a
deptford
woman
related
to
dickie
mother
kept
the
child
she
was
not
kind
to
him
and
he
left
her
later
she
met
a
man
who
had
been
a
burglar
he
had
entered
talbot
court
opened
a
panel
and
found
that
old
letter
that
told
of
dickie
birth
he
and
she
have
kidnapped
dickie
hoping
to
get
him
to
sign
a
paper
promising
to
pay
them
money
for
giving
him
the
letter
which
tells
how
he
is
heir
to
arden
but
already
they
have
found
out
that
a
letter
signed
by
a
child
is
useless
and
unlawful
and
they
dare
not
let
richard
go
for
fear
of
punishment
so
if
you
choose
to
do
nothing
your
father
is
safe
and
you
will
inherit
arden
what
am
i
to
do
edred
asked
again
to
get
dickie
back
i
mean
you
must
go
alone
and
at
night
to
beale
cottage
open
the
door
and
you
will
find
richard
dog
asleep
before
the
fire
you
must
unchain
the
dog
and
take
him
to
the
milestone
by
the
crossroads
then
go
where
the
dog
goes
you
will
need
a
knife
to
cut
cords
with
and
you
will
need
all
your
courage
look
in
my
eyes
edred
looked
in
the
eyes
of
the
mouldiestwarp
and
saw
that
they
were
no
longer
a
mole
eyes
but
were
like
the
eyes
of
all
the
dear
people
he
had
ever
known
and
through
them
the
soul
of
all
the
brave
people
he
had
ever
read
about
looked
out
at
him
and
said
courage
edred
be
one
of
us
now
look
at
the
people
on
the
hall
said
the
mouldiestwarp
edred
looked
and
behold
they
were
no
longer
strangers
he
knew
them
all
joan
of
arc
and
peter
the
hermit
hereward
and
drake
elsa
whose
brothers
were
swans
george
who
killed
the
dragon
blondel
who
sang
to
his
king
in
prison
lady
nithsdale
who
brought
her
husband
safe
out
of
the
cruel
tower
there
were
captains
who
went
down
with
their
ships
generals
who
died
fighting
for
forlorn
hopes
patriots
kings
nuns
monks
men
women
and
children
all
with
that
light
in
their
eyes
which
brightens
with
splendor
the
dreams
of
men
and
as
he
came
down
off
the
throne
the
great
ones
crowded
round
him
clasping
his
hand
and
saying
be
one
of
us
edred
be
one
of
us
then
an
intense
white
light
shone
so
that
the
children
could
see
nothing
else
and
then
suddenly
there
they
were
again
within
the
narrow
walls
of
edred
bedroom
well
said
elfrida
in
tones
of
brisk
commonplace
what
did
it
say
to
you
i
say
you
do
look
funny
do
said
edred
crossly
he
began
to
tear
off
the
armor
here
help
me
to
get
these
things
off
but
what
did
it
say
elfrida
asked
helpfully
i
ca
tell
you
i
not
going
to
tell
any
one
till
it
over
oh
just
as
you
like
said
elfrida
keep
your
old
secrets
and
left
him
that
was
hard
was
it
i
ca
help
it
i
tell
you
oh
elfrida
if
going
to
bother
it
just
a
little
bit
too
much
that
all
you
really
must
tell
me
i
told
you
so
fifty
times
he
said
which
was
untrue
you
know
he
had
really
only
told
her
twice
very
well
then
she
said
heroically
i
wo
ask
you
a
single
thing
but
you
tell
me
the
minute
you
can
wo
you
and
you
let
me
help
nobody
can
help
no
one
can
advise
me
edred
said
i
got
to
do
it
off
my
own
bat
if
i
do
it
at
all
now
you
just
shut
up
i
want
to
think
this
unusual
desire
quite
awed
elfrida
but
it
irritated
her
too
perhaps
you
like
me
to
go
away
she
said
ironically
and
edred
wholly
unexpected
reply
was
yes
please
so
she
went
and
when
she
was
gone
edred
sat
down
on
the
box
at
the
foot
of
his
bed
and
tried
to
think
but
it
was
not
easy
i
ought
to
go
he
told
himself
but
think
of
your
father
said
something
else
which
was
himself
too
he
thought
so
hard
that
his
thoughts
got
quite
confused
his
head
grew
very
hot
and
his
hands
and
feet
very
cold
honeysett
came
in
exclaimed
at
his
white
face
felt
his
hands
said
he
was
in
a
high
fever
and
put
him
to
bed
with
wet
rags
on
his
forehead
and
bottles
to
his
feet
perhaps
he
was
feverish
at
any
rate
he
could
never
be
sure
afterwards
whether
there
really
had
been
a
very
polite
and
plausible
black
mole
sitting
on
his
pillow
most
of
the
day
saying
all
those
things
which
the
part
of
himself
that
he
liked
least
agreed
with
such
things
as
think
of
your
father
no
one
will
ever
know
dickie
will
be
all
right
somehow
perhaps
you
only
dreamed
that
about
dickie
being
shut
up
somewhere
and
it
not
true
anyway
it
not
your
business
is
it
and
so
on
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
elfrida
was
not
allowed
to
come
into
the
room
for
fear
edred
should
be
ill
with
something
catching
so
he
lay
tossing
all
day
hearing
the
black
mole
or
something
else
say
all
these
things
and
himself
saying
i
must
go
oh
poor
dickie
i
promised
to
go
yes
i
will
go
and
late
that
night
when
lord
arden
had
come
home
and
had
gone
to
bed
tired
out
by
a
long
day
vain
search
for
the
lost
dickie
and
when
everybody
was
asleep
edred
got
up
and
dressed
he
put
his
bedroom
candle
and
matches
in
his
pocket
crept
and
out
of
the
house
and
up
to
beale
it
was
a
slow
and
nervous
business
more
than
once
on
the
staircase
he
thought
he
heard
a
stair
creak
behind
him
and
again
and
again
as
he
went
along
the
road
he
fancied
he
heard
a
soft
footstep
behind
him
but
of
course
when
he
looked
round
he
could
see
no
one
was
there
so
presently
he
decided
that
it
was
cowardly
to
keep
looking
round
and
besides
it
only
made
him
more
frightened
so
he
kept
steadily
on
and
took
no
notice
at
all
of
a
black
patch
by
the
sweetbrier
bush
by
beale
cottage
door
just
exactly
as
if
some
one
was
crouching
in
the
shadow
he
pressed
his
thumb
on
the
latch
and
opened
the
door
very
softly
something
moved
inside
and
a
chain
rattled
edred
heart
gave
a
soft
uncomfortable
jump
but
it
was
only
true
standing
up
to
receive
company
he
saw
the
whiteness
of
the
dog
and
made
for
it
felt
for
the
chain
unhooked
it
from
the
staple
in
the
wall
and
went
out
again
closing
the
door
after
him
and
followed
very
willingly
by
true
again
he
looked
suspiciously
at
the
shadow
of
the
great
sweetbrier
but
the
dog
showed
no
uneasiness
so
edred
knew
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
afraid
of
true
in
fact
was
the
greatest
comfort
to
him
he
told
elfrida
afterwards
that
it
was
all
true
doing
he
could
never
he
was
sure
have
gone
on
without
that
good
companion
true
followed
at
the
slack
chain
end
till
they
got
to
the
milestone
and
then
suddenly
he
darted
ahead
and
took
the
lead
the
chain
stretched
taut
and
the
boy
had
all
his
work
cut
out
to
keep
up
with
the
dog
up
the
hill
they
went
on
to
the
downs
and
in
and
out
among
the
furze
bushes
the
night
was
no
longer
dark
to
edred
his
eyes
had
got
used
to
the
gentle
starlight
and
he
followed
the
dog
among
the
gorse
and
brambles
without
stumbling
and
without
hurting
himself
against
the
million
sharp
spears
and
thorns
suddenly
true
paused
sniffed
sneezed
blew
through
his
nose
and
began
to
dig
come
on
come
on
good
dog
said
edred
come
on
true
for
his
fancy
pictured
dickie
a
prisoner
in
some
lonely
cottage
and
he
longed
to
get
to
it
and
set
him
free
and
get
safe
back
home
with
him
so
he
pulled
at
the
chain
but
true
only
shook
himself
and
went
on
digging
the
spot
he
had
chosen
was
under
a
clump
of
furze
bigger
than
any
they
had
passed
the
sharp
pricked
his
nose
and
paws
but
true
was
not
the
dog
to
be
stopped
by
little
things
like
that
he
only
stopped
every
now
and
then
to
sneeze
and
blow
and
then
went
on
digging
edred
remembered
the
knife
he
had
brought
it
was
the
big
out
of
the
drawer
in
the
hall
he
pulled
it
out
he
would
cut
away
some
of
the
furze
branches
perhaps
dickie
was
lying
bound
hidden
in
the
middle
of
the
furze
bush
dickie
he
said
softly
dickie
but
no
one
answered
only
true
sneezed
and
snuffed
and
blew
and
went
on
digging
so
then
edred
took
hold
of
a
branch
of
furze
to
cut
it
and
it
was
loose
and
came
away
in
his
hand
without
any
cutting
he
tried
another
that
too
was
loose
he
took
off
his
jacket
and
threw
it
over
his
hands
to
protect
them
and
seizing
an
armful
of
furze
pulled
and
fell
back
a
great
bundle
of
the
prickly
stuff
on
top
of
him
true
was
pulling
like
mad
at
the
chain
edred
scrambled
up
the
furze
he
had
pulled
away
disclosed
a
hole
and
true
was
disappearing
down
it
edred
saw
as
the
dog
dragged
him
close
to
the
hole
that
it
was
a
large
one
though
only
part
of
it
had
been
uncovered
he
stooped
to
peer
in
his
foot
slipped
on
the
edge
and
he
fell
right
into
it
the
dog
dragging
all
the
time
stop
true
lie
down
sir
he
said
and
the
dog
paused
though
the
chain
was
still
strained
tight
then
edred
was
glad
of
his
bedroom
candle
he
pulled
it
out
and
lighted
it
and
blinked
perceiving
almost
at
once
that
he
was
in
the
beginning
of
an
underground
passage
he
looked
up
he
could
see
above
him
the
stars
plain
through
a
net
of
furze
bushes
he
stood
up
and
true
went
on
next
moment
he
knew
that
he
was
in
the
old
smugglers
cave
that
he
and
elfrida
had
so
often
tried
to
find
the
dog
and
the
boy
went
on
along
a
passage
down
steps
cut
in
the
rock
through
a
rough
heavy
door
and
so
into
the
smugglers
cave
itself
an
enormous
cavern
as
big
as
a
church
out
of
an
opening
at
the
upper
end
a
stream
of
water
fell
and
ran
along
the
cave
clear
between
shores
of
smooth
sand
and
lying
on
the
sand
near
the
stream
was
something
dark
true
gave
a
bound
that
jerked
the
chain
out
of
edred
hand
and
leaped
upon
the
dark
thing
licking
it
whining
and
uttering
little
dog
moans
of
pure
love
and
joy
for
the
dark
something
was
dickie
fast
asleep
he
was
bound
with
cords
his
poor
lame
foot
tied
tight
to
the
other
one
his
arms
were
bound
too
and
now
he
was
awake
down
true
he
said
hush
ssh
where
are
they
the
man
and
woman
edred
whispered
oh
edred
you
you
perfect
brick
dickie
whispered
back
they
in
the
further
cave
i
heard
them
snoring
before
i
went
to
sleep
lie
still
said
edred
i
got
a
knife
i
cut
the
cords
he
cut
them
and
dickie
tried
to
stand
up
but
his
limbs
were
too
stiff
edred
rubbed
his
legs
while
dickie
stretched
his
fingers
to
get
the
pins
and
needles
out
of
his
arms
edred
had
stuck
the
candle
in
the
sand
it
made
a
ring
of
light
round
them
that
was
why
they
did
not
see
a
dark
figure
that
came
quietly
creeping
across
the
sand
towards
them
it
was
quite
close
to
them
before
edred
looked
up
illustration
said
both
boys
at
once
oh
he
gasped
and
dickie
looking
up
whispered
it
all
up
never
mind
me
i
shall
get
away
all
right
no
said
edred
and
then
with
a
joyous
leap
of
the
heart
perceived
that
the
dark
figure
was
elfrida
in
her
father
ulster
i
had
time
to
put
on
my
stockings
she
explained
later
have
known
me
a
mile
off
by
my
white
legs
if
i
had
covered
them
up
with
this
elfrida
said
both
boys
at
once
well
you
did
think
i
was
going
to
be
out
of
it
she
said
been
behind
you
all
the
way
edred
do
tell
me
anything
i
wo
ask
any
questions
only
come
along
out
of
it
lean
on
me
they
got
him
up
to
the
passage
one
on
each
side
and
by
that
time
dickie
could
use
his
legs
and
his
crutch
they
got
home
and
roused
lord
arden
and
told
him
dickie
was
found
and
all
about
it
and
he
roused
the
house
and
he
and
beale
and
men
from
the
village
went
up
to
the
cave
and
found
that
wicked
man
and
woman
in
a
stupid
sleep
and
tied
their
hands
and
marched
them
to
the
town
and
to
the
when
the
man
was
searched
the
letter
was
found
on
him
which
the
man
it
was
that
redheaded
man
you
have
heard
of
had
taken
from
talbot
court
i
wish
you
joy
of
your
good
fortune
my
boy
said
lord
arden
when
he
had
read
the
letter
of
course
we
must
look
into
things
but
i
feel
no
doubt
at
all
that
you
lord
arden
i
do
want
to
be
said
dickie
and
that
was
true
yet
at
the
same
time
he
did
want
to
be
the
thought
of
being
richard
lord
arden
he
who
had
been
just
little
lame
dickie
of
deptford
of
owning
this
glorious
castle
of
being
the
master
of
an
old
name
and
an
old
place
this
thought
sang
in
his
heart
a
very
beautiful
tune
yet
what
he
said
was
true
there
is
so
often
room
in
our
hearts
for
two
tunes
at
a
time
i
do
want
to
be
you
ought
to
be
sir
you
been
so
kind
to
me
he
said
my
dear
boy
said
the
father
of
edred
and
elfrida
i
did
very
well
without
the
title
and
the
castle
and
if
they
yours
i
shall
do
very
well
without
them
again
you
shall
have
your
rights
my
dear
boy
and
i
sha
be
hurt
by
it
do
you
think
that
dickie
thought
several
things
and
shook
the
other
hand
very
hard
the
tale
of
dickie
rescue
from
the
cave
was
the
talk
of
the
countryside
true
was
praised
much
but
edred
more
why
had
no
one
else
thought
of
putting
the
dog
on
the
scent
edred
said
that
it
was
mostly
true
doing
and
the
people
praised
his
modesty
and
nobody
except
perhaps
elfrida
ever
understood
what
it
had
cost
edred
to
go
that
night
through
the
dark
and
rescue
his
cousin
edred
father
and
honeysett
agreed
that
edred
had
done
it
in
the
delirium
of
a
fever
brought
on
by
his
anxiety
about
his
friend
and
playmate
people
do
you
know
do
odd
things
in
fevers
that
they
would
never
do
at
other
times
the
redheaded
man
and
the
woman
were
tried
at
the
assizes
and
punished
if
you
ask
me
how
they
knew
about
the
caves
which
none
of
the
country
people
seemed
to
know
of
i
can
only
answer
that
i
do
know
only
i
know
that
every
one
you
know
knows
lots
of
things
that
you
do
know
they
know
when
they
all
went
a
week
later
to
explore
the
caves
they
found
a
curious
arrangement
of
brickwork
and
cement
and
clay
shutting
up
a
hole
through
which
the
stream
had
evidently
once
flowed
out
into
the
open
air
it
now
flowed
away
into
darkness
lord
arden
pointed
out
how
its
course
had
been
diverted
and
made
to
run
down
underground
to
the
sea
we
might
let
it
come
back
to
the
moat
said
edred
it
used
to
run
that
way
it
says
so
in
the
of
arden
we
must
decide
that
later
said
his
father
who
had
a
long
blue
lawyer
letter
in
his
pocket
chapter
xi
lord
arden
there
was
a
lot
of
talk
and
a
lot
of
before
any
one
seemed
to
be
able
to
be
sure
who
was
lord
arden
if
the
father
of
edred
and
elfrida
had
wanted
to
dispute
about
it
no
doubt
there
would
have
been
enough
work
to
keep
the
lawyers
busy
for
years
and
seas
of
ink
would
have
been
spilled
and
thunders
of
eloquence
spent
on
the
question
but
as
the
present
lord
arden
was
an
honest
man
and
only
too
anxious
that
dickie
should
have
everything
that
belonged
to
him
even
the
lawyers
had
to
cut
their
work
short
when
edred
saw
how
his
father
tried
his
best
to
find
out
the
truth
about
dickie
birth
and
how
willing
he
was
to
give
up
what
he
had
thought
was
his
own
if
it
should
prove
to
be
his
do
you
think
he
was
not
glad
to
know
that
he
had
done
his
duty
and
rescued
his
cousin
and
had
not
by
any
meanness
or
any
indecision
brought
dishonor
on
the
name
of
arden
as
for
elfrida
when
she
knew
the
whole
story
of
that
night
of
rescue
she
admired
her
brother
so
much
that
it
made
him
almost
uncomfortable
however
she
now
looked
up
to
him
in
all
things
and
consulted
him
about
everything
and
after
all
this
is
very
pleasant
from
your
sister
especially
when
every
one
has
been
rather
in
the
habit
of
suggesting
that
she
is
better
than
you
are
as
well
as
cleverer
to
dickie
lord
arden
said
of
course
if
anything
happen
to
show
that
i
am
really
lord
arden
you
wo
desert
us
dickie
you
shall
go
to
school
with
edred
and
be
brought
up
like
my
very
own
son
and
like
lord
arden
very
own
son
dickie
lived
at
the
house
in
arden
castle
and
grew
to
love
it
more
and
more
he
no
longer
wanted
to
get
away
from
these
present
times
to
those
old
days
when
james
the
first
was
king
the
times
you
are
born
in
are
always
more
than
any
other
times
can
be
when
dickie
lived
miserably
at
deptford
he
always
longed
to
go
to
those
old
times
as
a
man
who
is
unhappy
at
home
may
wish
to
travel
to
other
countries
but
a
man
who
is
happy
in
his
home
does
not
want
to
leave
it
and
at
arden
dickie
was
happy
the
training
he
had
had
in
the
life
enabled
him
to
take
his
place
and
to
be
unembarrassed
with
the
ardens
and
their
friends
as
he
was
with
the
beales
and
theirs
a
little
shy
the
ardens
friends
told
each
other
but
what
fine
manners
and
to
think
he
was
only
a
tramp
lord
arden
has
certainly
done
wonders
with
him
so
lord
arden
got
the
credit
of
all
that
dickie
had
learned
from
his
tutors
in
james
the
first
time
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
any
child
to
brood
continually
on
the
past
or
the
future
the
child
lives
in
the
present
and
dickie
lived
at
arden
and
loved
it
and
enjoyed
himself
and
lord
arden
bought
him
a
pony
so
that
his
lame
foot
was
hardly
any
drag
at
all
the
other
children
had
a
and
the
three
made
all
sorts
of
interesting
expeditions
once
they
went
over
to
talbot
court
and
saw
the
secret
place
where
edward
talbot
had
hidden
his
confession
about
having
stolen
the
arden
baby
three
generations
before
also
they
saw
the
portrait
of
the
lady
talbot
who
had
been
a
miss
arden
in
brocade
she
was
with
a
green
silk
petticoat
and
her
powdered
hair
dressed
high
over
a
great
cushion
but
her
eyes
and
her
mouth
were
the
eyes
of
dickie
of
deptford
lady
talbot
was
very
charming
to
the
children
played
with
them
and
gave
them
a
delightful
and
varied
tea
in
the
yew
arbor
i
glad
you
would
let
me
adopt
you
richard
she
said
when
elfrida
and
edred
had
been
sent
to
her
garden
to
get
a
basket
of
peaches
to
take
home
with
them
because
just
when
i
had
become
entirely
attached
to
you
you
would
have
found
out
your
real
relations
and
where
would
your
poor
have
been
then
if
i
could
have
stayed
with
you
i
would
said
dickie
seriously
i
did
like
you
most
awfully
even
then
you
are
very
like
the
lady
arden
whose
husband
was
shut
up
in
the
tower
for
the
gunpowder
plot
so
they
tell
me
said
lady
talbot
but
how
do
you
know
it
i
do
know
said
dickie
confused
but
you
like
her
you
must
have
seen
a
portrait
of
her
there
one
in
the
national
portrait
gallery
she
was
a
delamere
and
my
name
was
delamere
too
before
i
was
married
she
was
one
of
the
same
family
you
see
dear
dickie
put
his
arms
round
her
waist
as
she
sat
beside
him
and
laid
his
head
on
her
shoulder
i
wish
you
really
been
my
mother
he
said
and
his
thoughts
were
back
in
the
other
days
with
the
mother
who
wore
a
ruff
and
hoop
lady
talbot
hugged
him
tenderly
my
dear
little
dickie
she
said
you
do
wish
it
as
much
as
i
do
there
are
all
sorts
of
things
a
chap
ca
be
sure
of
things
you
must
tell
any
one
secrets
you
know
honorable
secrets
but
if
it
was
your
own
mother
it
would
be
different
but
if
you
have
got
a
mother
you
have
to
decide
everything
for
yourself
wo
you
let
me
help
you
she
asked
dickie
his
head
on
her
shoulder
was
for
one
wild
moment
tempted
to
tell
her
everything
the
whole
story
from
beginning
to
end
but
he
knew
that
she
could
not
understand
it
or
even
believe
it
no
person
could
a
chap
own
mother
might
have
perhaps
but
perhaps
not
too
i
ca
tell
you
he
said
at
last
only
i
do
think
i
want
to
be
lord
arden
at
least
i
do
frightfully
it
so
splendid
all
the
things
the
ardens
did
in
history
you
know
but
i
do
want
to
turn
people
out
and
you
know
edred
came
and
saved
me
from
those
people
it
feels
hateful
when
i
think
perhaps
they
have
to
turn
out
just
because
i
happened
to
turn
up
sometimes
i
feel
as
if
i
simply
could
bear
it
you
dear
child
she
said
of
course
you
feel
that
but
do
let
your
mind
dwell
on
it
do
think
about
it
you
only
a
little
boy
be
happy
and
jolly
and
do
worry
about
things
leave
things
to
the
you
see
dickie
told
her
somehow
i
always
had
to
worry
about
things
what
with
beale
and
one
thing
and
another
that
was
the
man
you
ran
away
from
me
to
go
to
yes
said
dickie
gravely
you
see
i
was
responsible
for
beale
and
now
do
you
feel
responsible
any
more
no
said
dickie
in
businesslike
tones
you
see
i
settled
beale
in
life
you
ca
be
responsible
for
married
people
responsible
for
each
other
so
now
i
got
only
my
own
affairs
to
think
of
and
the
ardens
i
do
know
what
to
do
do
why
there
nothing
do
except
to
enjoy
yourself
and
learn
your
lessons
and
be
happy
she
told
him
do
worry
your
little
head
just
enjoy
yourself
and
forget
that
you
ever
had
any
responsibilities
i
try
he
told
her
and
then
the
others
came
back
with
their
peaches
and
there
was
nothing
more
to
be
said
but
thank
you
very
much
and
exploring
the
old
smugglers
caves
was
exciting
and
delightful
as
exploring
caves
always
is
it
turned
out
that
more
than
one
old
man
in
the
village
had
heard
from
his
father
about
the
caves
and
the
smuggling
that
had
gone
on
in
those
parts
in
old
ancient
days
but
they
had
not
thought
it
their
place
to
talk
about
such
things
and
i
suspect
that
in
their
hearts
they
did
not
more
than
half
believe
them
old
beale
said
why
did
you
ask
me
i
could
you
where
they
was
only
i
should
a
done
fear
you
break
your
precious
necks
of
course
the
children
were
desperately
anxious
to
open
up
the
brickwork
and
let
the
stream
come
out
into
the
light
of
day
only
their
father
thought
it
would
be
too
expensive
but
edred
and
elfrida
worried
and
bothered
in
a
perfectly
gentle
and
polite
way
till
at
last
a
very
jolly
gentleman
in
spectacles
who
came
down
to
spend
a
couple
of
days
took
their
part
from
the
moment
he
owned
himself
an
engineer
edred
and
elfrida
gave
him
no
peace
and
he
seemed
quite
pleased
to
be
taken
to
see
the
caves
he
pointed
out
that
the
removal
of
the
simple
dam
would
send
the
water
back
into
the
old
channel
it
would
be
perfectly
simple
to
have
the
brickwork
knocked
out
and
to
let
the
stream
find
its
way
back
if
it
could
to
its
old
channel
and
thence
down
the
arched
way
which
edred
and
elfrida
told
him
they
were
certain
was
under
a
mound
below
the
castle
you
know
a
lot
about
it
do
you
he
said
yes
said
edred
simply
then
they
all
went
down
to
the
mound
and
the
engineer
then
poked
and
prodded
it
and
said
he
should
not
wonder
if
they
were
not
so
far
out
and
then
beale
and
another
man
came
with
spades
and
presently
there
was
the
arch
as
good
as
ever
and
they
exclaimed
and
admired
and
went
back
to
the
caves
it
was
a
grand
moment
when
the
bricks
had
been
taken
out
and
daylight
poured
into
the
cave
and
nothing
remained
but
to
break
down
the
dam
and
let
the
water
run
out
of
the
darkness
into
the
sunshine
you
can
imagine
with
what
mixed
feelings
the
children
wondered
whether
they
would
rather
stay
in
the
cave
and
see
the
dam
demolished
or
stay
outside
and
see
the
stream
rush
out
in
the
end
the
boys
stayed
within
and
it
was
only
elfrida
and
her
father
who
saw
the
stream
emerge
they
sat
on
a
hillock
among
the
thin
harebells
and
wild
thyme
and
sweet
gipsy
roses
with
their
eyes
fixed
on
the
opening
in
the
hillside
and
waited
and
waited
and
waited
for
a
very
long
time
wo
you
mind
frightfully
daddy
elfrida
asked
during
this
long
waiting
if
it
turns
out
that
you
not
lord
arden
he
paused
a
moment
before
he
decided
to
answer
her
without
reserve
yes
he
said
i
shall
mind
frightfully
and
that
just
why
we
must
do
everything
we
possibly
can
to
prove
that
dickie
is
the
rightful
heir
so
that
whether
he
has
the
title
or
i
have
it
you
and
i
may
never
have
to
reproach
ourselves
for
having
left
a
single
stone
unturned
to
give
him
his
rights
whatever
they
are
and
you
yours
daddy
and
me
mine
anyhow
if
he
is
lord
arden
i
shall
probably
be
appointed
his
guardian
and
we
shall
all
live
together
here
just
the
same
only
i
shall
go
back
to
being
plain
arden
i
believe
dickie
lord
arden
elfrida
began
and
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
she
would
not
have
gone
on
to
give
her
reasons
including
the
whole
story
which
the
mouldiestwarp
had
told
to
dickie
but
at
that
moment
there
was
a
roaring
rushing
sound
from
inside
the
cave
and
a
flash
of
shiny
silver
gleamed
across
that
dark
gap
in
the
hillside
there
was
a
burst
of
imprisoned
splendor
the
stream
leaped
out
and
flowed
right
and
left
over
the
dry
grass
till
it
lapped
in
tiny
waves
against
their
hillock
like
sand
castles
as
elfrida
observed
it
spread
out
in
a
lake
wider
and
wider
but
presently
gathered
itself
together
and
began
to
creep
down
the
hill
winding
in
and
out
among
the
hillocks
in
an
stream
come
on
childie
let
make
for
the
moat
we
shall
get
there
first
if
we
run
our
hardest
elfrida
father
said
and
he
ran
with
his
little
daughter
hand
in
his
they
got
there
first
the
stream
knowing
its
own
mind
better
and
better
as
it
recognized
its
old
road
reached
the
castle
and
by
all
the
grass
round
the
castle
was
under
water
by
the
water
in
the
moat
was
a
foot
or
more
deep
and
when
they
got
up
next
morning
the
castle
was
surrounded
by
a
splendid
moat
fifty
feet
wide
and
a
stream
ran
from
it
in
a
zigzag
way
it
is
true
but
still
it
ran
to
the
lower
arch
under
the
mound
and
disappeared
there
to
run
underground
into
the
sea
they
enjoyed
the
moat
for
one
whole
day
and
then
the
stream
was
dammed
again
and
condemned
to
run
underground
till
next
spring
by
which
time
the
walls
of
the
castle
would
have
been
examined
and
concrete
laid
to
their
base
lest
the
water
should
creep
through
and
sap
the
foundations
it
going
to
be
a
very
costly
business
it
seems
elfrida
heard
her
father
say
to
the
engineer
and
i
do
know
that
i
ought
to
do
it
but
i
ca
resist
the
temptation
i
shall
have
to
economize
in
other
directions
that
all
when
elfrida
had
heard
this
she
went
to
dickie
and
edred
who
were
fishing
in
the
cave
and
told
them
what
she
had
heard
and
we
have
another
try
for
the
treasure
she
said
whoever
has
the
castle
will
want
to
restore
it
they
got
those
pictures
of
it
as
it
used
to
be
and
then
there
are
all
the
cottages
to
rebuild
dear
dickie
you
so
clever
do
think
of
some
way
to
find
the
treasure
so
dickie
thought
and
presently
he
said
you
once
saw
the
treasure
being
carried
to
the
secret
room
in
a
picture
did
you
they
told
him
yes
then
why
did
you
go
back
to
that
time
and
see
it
really
we
had
the
clothes
everything
in
our
magic
depended
on
clothes
mine
does
shall
we
go
there
were
lots
of
soldiers
in
the
picture
said
edred
and
fighting
i
not
afraid
of
soldiers
said
elfrida
very
quickly
and
you
not
afraid
of
edred
you
know
you
are
you
ca
be
or
you
could
have
come
after
me
right
into
the
cave
in
the
middle
of
the
night
come
on
stand
close
together
and
i
spread
out
the
so
dickie
said
and
they
stood
and
he
spread
the
out
and
he
wished
to
be
with
the
party
of
men
who
were
hiding
the
treasure
but
before
he
spread
out
the
seeds
he
took
certain
other
things
in
his
left
hand
and
held
them
closely
and
instantly
they
were
they
were
standing
very
close
together
all
three
of
them
in
a
niche
in
a
narrow
dark
passage
and
men
went
by
them
carrying
heavy
chests
and
great
sacks
of
leather
and
bundles
tied
up
in
straw
and
in
handkerchiefs
the
men
had
long
hair
and
the
kind
of
clothes
you
know
were
worn
when
charles
the
first
was
king
and
the
children
wore
the
dresses
of
that
time
and
the
boys
had
little
swords
at
their
sides
when
the
last
bundle
had
been
carried
the
last
chest
set
down
with
a
dump
on
the
stone
floor
of
some
room
beyond
the
children
heard
a
door
shut
and
a
key
turned
and
then
the
men
came
back
all
together
along
the
passage
and
the
children
followed
them
presently
torchlight
gave
way
to
daylight
as
they
came
out
into
the
open
air
but
they
had
to
come
on
hands
and
knees
for
the
path
sloped
steeply
up
and
the
opening
was
very
low
the
chests
must
have
been
pushed
or
pulled
through
they
could
never
have
been
carried
the
children
turned
and
looked
at
the
opening
it
was
in
the
courtyard
wall
the
courtyard
that
was
now
a
smooth
grass
lawn
and
not
the
rough
daisied
grass
plot
dotted
with
heaps
of
broken
stone
and
masonry
that
they
were
used
to
see
and
as
they
looked
two
men
picked
up
a
great
stone
and
staggered
forward
with
it
and
laid
it
on
the
stone
floor
of
the
secret
passage
just
where
it
ended
at
the
edge
of
the
grass
then
another
stone
and
another
the
stones
fitted
into
their
places
like
bits
of
a
chinese
puzzle
there
was
mortar
or
cement
at
their
edges
and
when
the
last
stone
was
replaced
no
one
could
tell
those
stones
from
the
other
stones
that
formed
the
wall
only
the
grass
in
front
of
them
was
trampled
and
broken
fetch
food
and
break
it
about
said
the
man
who
seemed
to
be
in
command
that
it
may
look
as
though
the
men
had
eaten
here
and
trample
the
grass
at
other
places
i
give
the
roundhead
dogs
another
hour
to
break
down
our
last
defense
children
go
to
your
mother
this
is
no
place
for
you
they
knew
the
way
they
had
seen
it
in
the
picture
edred
and
elfrida
turned
to
go
but
dickie
whispered
do
wait
for
me
i
something
yet
to
do
and
when
the
soldiers
had
gone
to
get
food
and
strew
it
about
as
they
had
been
told
to
do
dickie
crept
up
to
the
stones
that
had
been
removed
from
which
he
had
never
taken
his
eyes
knelt
down
and
scratched
on
one
of
the
stones
with
one
of
the
big
nails
he
had
brought
in
his
hand
it
blunted
over
and
he
took
another
hiding
in
the
chapel
doorway
when
the
men
came
back
with
the
food
every
man
to
his
post
and
god
save
us
all
cried
the
captain
when
the
food
was
spread
they
clattered
off
they
were
in
their
armor
now
and
dickie
knelt
down
again
and
went
on
scratching
with
the
nail
the
air
was
full
of
shouting
and
the
sound
of
guns
and
the
clash
of
armor
and
a
shattering
sound
like
a
giant
mallet
striking
a
giant
drum
a
sound
that
came
and
came
again
at
intervals
and
the
shrieks
of
wounded
men
dickie
pressed
up
the
grass
to
cover
the
marks
he
had
made
on
the
stone
so
low
as
to
be
almost
underground
and
quite
hidden
by
the
grass
roots
then
he
brushed
the
stone
dust
from
his
hands
and
stood
up
the
treasure
was
found
and
its
marked
now
he
would
find
edred
and
elfrida
and
they
would
go
back
whether
he
was
lord
of
arden
or
no
it
was
he
and
no
other
who
had
restored
the
fallen
fortunes
of
that
noble
house
he
turned
to
go
the
way
his
cousins
had
gone
he
could
see
the
crowding
in
the
archway
of
the
great
gate
tower
from
a
window
to
his
right
a
lady
leaned
pale
with
terror
and
with
her
were
edred
and
elfrida
he
could
just
see
their
white
faces
he
made
for
the
door
below
that
window
but
it
was
too
late
that
dull
thudding
sound
came
again
and
this
time
it
was
followed
by
a
great
crash
and
a
great
shouting
the
blue
sky
showed
through
the
archway
where
the
tall
gates
had
been
and
under
the
arch
was
a
mass
of
men
shouting
screaming
struggling
and
the
gleam
of
steel
and
the
scarlet
of
brave
blood
dickie
forgot
all
about
the
door
below
the
window
forgot
all
about
his
cousins
forgot
that
he
had
found
the
treasure
and
that
it
was
now
his
business
to
get
himself
and
the
others
safely
back
to
their
own
times
he
only
saw
the
house
he
loved
broken
into
by
men
he
hated
he
saw
the
men
he
loved
spending
their
blood
like
water
to
defend
that
house
he
drew
the
little
sword
that
hung
at
his
side
and
shouting
an
arden
an
arden
he
rushed
towards
the
swaying
staggering
he
reached
it
just
as
the
leader
of
the
attacking
party
had
hewn
his
way
through
the
arden
men
and
taken
his
first
step
on
the
flagged
path
of
the
courtyard
the
first
step
was
his
last
he
stopped
a
big
burly
fellow
in
a
leathern
coat
and
steel
round
cap
and
looked
bewildered
at
the
little
figure
coming
at
him
with
all
the
fire
and
courage
of
the
ardens
burning
in
his
blue
eyes
the
big
man
laughed
and
as
he
laughed
dickie
lunged
with
his
sword
the
way
his
tutor
had
taught
him
and
the
little
sword
no
tailor
ornament
to
a
court
dress
but
a
piece
of
true
steel
went
straight
and
true
up
into
the
heart
of
that
big
rebel
the
man
fell
wrenching
the
blade
from
dickie
hand
a
shout
of
fury
went
up
from
the
enemy
a
shout
of
pride
and
triumph
from
the
arden
men
men
struggled
and
fought
all
about
him
next
moment
dickie
hands
were
tied
with
a
handkerchief
and
he
stood
there
breathless
and
trembling
with
pride
illustration
have
killed
a
man
he
said
i
have
killed
a
man
he
said
i
have
killed
a
man
for
the
king
and
for
arden
they
shut
him
up
in
the
fuel
shed
and
locked
the
door
pride
and
anger
filled
him
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
that
one
good
thrust
for
the
good
cause
but
presently
he
remembered
he
had
brought
his
cousins
here
he
must
get
them
back
safely
but
how
on
a
quiet
evening
on
the
road
beale
had
taught
him
how
to
untie
hands
tied
behind
the
back
he
remembered
the
lesson
now
and
set
to
work
but
it
was
slow
work
and
all
the
time
he
was
thinking
thinking
how
could
he
get
out
he
knew
the
fuel
shed
well
enough
the
door
was
strong
there
was
a
beech
bar
outside
but
it
was
not
roofed
with
tile
or
lead
as
the
rest
of
the
castle
was
and
dickie
knew
something
about
thatch
not
for
nothing
had
he
watched
the
men
thatching
the
by
the
medway
when
his
hands
were
free
he
stood
up
and
felt
for
the
pins
that
fasten
the
thatch
suddenly
his
hands
fell
by
his
side
even
if
he
got
out
how
could
he
find
his
cousins
he
would
only
be
found
by
the
rebels
and
be
locked
away
more
securely
he
lay
down
on
the
floor
lay
quite
still
there
it
was
despair
this
was
the
end
of
all
his
cleverness
he
had
brought
edred
and
elfrida
into
danger
and
he
could
not
get
them
back
again
his
anger
had
led
him
to
defy
the
roundheads
and
to
gratify
his
hate
of
them
he
had
sacrificed
those
two
who
trusted
him
he
lay
there
a
long
time
and
if
he
cried
a
little
it
was
very
dark
in
the
fuel
house
and
there
was
no
one
to
see
him
he
was
not
crying
however
but
thinking
thinking
thinking
and
trying
to
find
some
way
out
when
he
heard
a
little
scratch
scratching
on
the
corner
of
the
shed
he
sat
up
and
listened
the
scratching
went
on
he
held
his
breath
could
it
be
that
some
one
was
trying
to
get
in
to
help
him
nonsense
of
course
it
was
only
a
rat
next
moment
a
voice
spoke
so
close
to
him
that
he
started
and
all
but
cried
out
bide
where
you
be
lad

still
is
only
me
old
mouldiwarp
of

dickie
went
towards
the
voice
and
sure
enough
as
the
voice
said
there
was
a
hole
in
the
ground
just
big
enough
it
seemed
for
him
to
crawl
down
on
hands
and
knees
i
go

mouldiwarp

went
down
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
crept
down
the
mole
tunnel
of
soft
earth
and
then
along
and
then
up
and
there
they
were
in
the
courtyard
there
too
were
edred
and
elfrida
the
three
children
hugged
each
other
and
then
turned
to
the
mouldiwarp
how
can

get

the
old

he
said
and
from
the
sky
above
a
swan
carriage
suddenly
swooped
in
with
you
said
the
mouldiwarp
swan
carriages

take

we
ca
pick
nor
choose
when
it
danger
like
dis
in
with
you
be
off
with
you
this
is
the
last
you
see
o
me
be
off
afore
the
soldiers
sees
you
they
squeezed
into
the
swan
carriage
all
three
the
white
wings
spread
and
the
whole
equipage
rose
into
the
air
unseen
by
any
one
but
a
roundhead
sentinel
who
with
great
presence
of
mind
gave
the
alarm
and
was
kicked
for
his
pains
because
when
the
guard
turned
out
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
the
swans
flew
far
too
fast
for
the
children
to
see
where
they
were
going
and
when
the
swans
began
to
flap
more
slowly
so
that
the
children
could
have
seen
if
there
had
been
anything
to
see
there
was
nothing
to
be
seen
because
it
was
quite
dark
and
the
air
was
very
cold
but
presently
a
light
showed
ahead
and
next
moment
there
they
were
in
the
cave
and
stepped
out
of
the
carriage
on
the
exact
spot
where
dickie
had
set
out
the
and
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
the
swan
carriage
went
back
up
the
cave
with
a
swish
and
rustle
of
wings
and
the
children
went
down
the
hill
as
quickly
as
they
could
which
was
not
very
quickly
because
of
dickie
poor
lame
foot
the
boy
who
had
killed
a
cromwell
man
with
his
little
sword
had
not
been
lame
arrived
in
the
courtyard
dickie
proudly
led
the
way
and
stooped
to
examine
the
stones
near
the
ruined
arch
that
had
been
the
chapel
door
alas
there
was
not
a
sign
of
the
inscription
which
dickie
had
scratched
on
the
stone
when
the
roundheads
were
battering
at
the
gates
of
arden
castle
then
edred
said
aha
in
a
tone
of
triumph
took
notice
too
he
explained
it
the
fifth
stone
from
the
chapel
door
under
the
little
window
with
the
arden
arms
carved
over
it
there
no
other
window
with
that
over
it
i
get
the
cold
chisel
he
got
it
and
when
he
came
back
dickie
was
on
his
knees
by
the
wall
and
he
had
dug
with
his
hands
and
uncovered
the
stone
where
he
had
scratched
with
the
nails
and
there
was
the
mark
only
the
nail
had
slipped
once
or
twice
while
he
was
doing
the
so
that
it
looked
much
more
like
a
five
there
he
said
that
what
i
scratched
that
said
edred
why
that
always
been
there
we
found
that
when
we
were
digging
about
trying
to
find
the
treasure
quite
at
the
beginning
did
we
elf
and
elfrida
agreed
that
this
was
so
well
i
scratched
it
anyway
said
dickie
now
then
let
me
go
ahead
with
the
chisel
edred
let
him
he
knew
how
clever
dickie
was
with
his
hands
for
had
he
not
made
a
for
elfrida
and
a
for
edred
both
with
lids
that
fitted
dickie
got
the
point
of
the
chisel
between
the
stones
and
pried
and
pressed
here
and
there
and
at
the
other
end
till
the
stone
moved
forward
a
little
at
a
time
and
they
were
able
to
get
hold
of
it
and
drag
it
out
behind
was
darkness
a
hollow
dickie
plunged
his
arm
in
i
can
feel
the
door
he
said
it
all
right
let
fetch
father
suggested
elfrida
he
enjoy
it
so
so
he
was
fetched
elfrida
burst
into
the
library
where
her
father
was
busy
with
many
lawyers
letters
and
papers
and
also
with
the
lawyer
himself
a
stout
gentleman
in
a
tweed
suit
not
a
bit
like
the
long
lean
disagreeable
lawyers
you
read
about
in
books
please
daddy
she
cried
we
found
the
treasure
come
and
look
what
treasure
and
how
often
have
i
told
you
not
to
interrupt
me
when
i
am
busy
oh
well
said
elfrida
i
only
thought
it
would
amuse
you
daddy
we
found
a
place
and
there
a
door
behind
and
almost
sure
it
where
they
hid
the
treasure
when
cromwell
wicked
men
took
the
castle
there
is
a
legend
to
that
effect
said
elfrida
father
to
the
lawyer
who
was
looking
interested
you
must
forgive
us
if
our
family
enthusiasms
obliterate
our
manners
you
have
not
said
to
roscoe
elfrida
roscoe
said
elfrida
cheerfully
i
thought
it
was
the
engineer
day
and
not
the
lawyer
i
beg
your
pardon
you
mind
me
bursting
in
if
you
knew
how
very
important
the
treasure
is
to
the
fortunes
of
our
house
the
lawyer
laughed
i
am
deeply
interested
in
buried
treasure
it
would
be
a
great
treat
to
me
if
lord
arden
would
allow
me
to
assist
in
the
search
for
it
there
no
search
said
elfrida
because
it
found
we
been
searching
for
ages
oh
daddy
do
come
you
be
sorry
afterwards
if
you
do
if
roscoe
does
mind
then
said
her
father
indulgently
and
the
two
followed
elfrida
believing
that
they
were
just
going
to
be
kind
and
to
take
part
in
some
childish
game
of
their
feelings
were
very
different
when
they
peeped
through
the
hole
where
dickie
and
edred
had
removed
two
more
stones
and
saw
the
dusty
gray
of
the
wooden
door
beyond
very
soon
all
the
stones
were
out
and
the
door
was
disclosed
the
lock
plate
bore
the
arms
of
arden
and
the
door
was
not
to
be
shaken
we
must
get
a
locksmith
said
lord
arden
the
big
key
with
the
arms
on
it
cried
elfrida
one
of
those
in
the
iron
box
might
that
one
flew
to
fetch
it
a
good
deal
of
oil
and
more
patience
were
needed
before
the
key
consented
to
turn
in
the
lock
but
it
did
turn
and
the
low
passage
was
disclosed
it
hardly
seemed
a
passage
at
all
so
thick
and
low
hung
the
curtain
of
dusty
cobwebs
but
with
brooms
and
lanterns
and
much
sneezing
and
choking
the
whole
party
got
through
to
the
door
of
the
treasure
room
and
the
other
key
unlocked
that
and
there
in
real
fact
was
the
treasure
just
as
the
children
had
seen
it
the
chests
and
the
boxes
and
the
leathern
sacks
and
the
bundles
done
up
in
straw
and
in
handkerchiefs
the
lawyer
who
had
come
on
a
bicycle
went
off
on
it
at
racing
speed
to
tell
the
bank
at
cliffville
to
come
and
fetch
the
treasure
and
to
bring
police
to
watch
over
it
till
it
should
be
safe
in
the
bank
vaults
and
i
child
enough
he
said
before
he
went
as
well
as
cautious
enough
to
beg
you
not
to
bring
any
of
it
out
till
i
come
back
and
not
to
leave
guarding
the
entrance
till
the
police
are
here
so
when
the
treasure
at
last
saw
the
light
of
day
it
saw
it
under
the
eyes
of
policemen
and
bank
managers
and
all
the
servants
and
all
the
family
and
the
beales
and
true
and
half
the
village
beside
who
had
got
wind
of
the
strange
happenings
at
the
castle
and
had
crowded
in
through
the
now
undefended
gate
it
was
a
glorious
treasure
gold
and
silver
plate
jewels
and
beautiful
armor
along
with
a
pile
of
old
parchments
which
roscoe
said
were
worth
more
than
all
the
rest
put
together
for
they
were
the
of
great
estates
and
now
cried
beale
let
a
cheer
for
lord
arden
long
may
enjoy
find
says
i
the
cheers
went
up
given
with
a
good
heart
i
thank
you
all
said
the
father
of
edred
and
elfrida
i
thank
you
all
from
my
heart
and
you
may
be
sure
that
you
shall
share
in
this
good
fortune
the
old
lands
are
in
the
market
they
will
be
bought
back
and
every
house
on
arden
land
shall
be
made
sound
and
and
comfortable
the
castle
will
be
restored
almost
certainly
and
the
fortunes
of
arden
tenantry
will
be
the
fortunes
of
arden
castle
another
cheer
went
up
but
the
speaker
raised
his
hand
and
silence
waited
his
next
words
i
have
something
else
to
tell
you
he
said
and
as
well
now
as
later
this
gentleman
roscoe
my
solicitor
has
this
morning
brought
me
news
that
i
am
not
lord
arden
loud
murmurs
of
dissatisfaction
from
the
crowd
i
have
no
claim
to
the
title
he
went
on
grimly
my
father
was
a
younger
son
the
real
heir
was
kidnapped
and
supposed
to
be
dead
so
i
inherited
it
is
the
grandson
of
that
kidnapped
heir
who
is
lord
arden
i
know
his
whole
history
i
know
what
he
has
done
to
do
honor
to
himself
and
to
help
others
hear
hear
from
beale
i
know
all
his
life
and
i
am
proud
that
he
is
the
head
of
our
house
he
will
do
for
you
when
he
is
of
age
all
that
i
would
have
done
and
in
the
meantime
i
am
his
guardian
this
is
lord
arden
he
said
throwing
his
arm
round
the
shoulders
of
dickie
little
lame
dickie
who
stood
there
leaning
on
his
crutch
pale
as
death
this
is
lord
arden
come
to
his
own
cheer
for
him
men
as
you
never
cheered
before
three
cheers
for
richard
lord
arden
chapter
xii
the
end
what
a
triumph
for
little
lame
dickie
of
deptford
you
think
perhaps
that
he
was
happy
as
well
as
proud
for
proud
he
certainly
was
with
those
words
and
those
cheers
ringing
in
his
ears
he
had
just
done
the
best
he
could
and
tried
to
help
beale
and
the
dogs
and
the
man
who
had
thought
himself
to
be
lord
arden
had
said
i
am
proud
that
he
should
be
the
head
of
our
house
and
all
the
arden
folk
had
cheered
it
was
worth
having
lived
for
the
unselfish
kindness
and
affection
of
the
man
he
had
displaced
the
love
of
his
little
cousins
the
devotion
of
beale
the
fact
that
he
was
lord
of
arden
and
would
soon
be
lord
of
all
the
old
acres
the
knowledge
that
now
he
would
learn
all
he
chose
to
learn
and
hold
in
his
hand
some
day
the
destinies
of
these
village
folk
all
loyal
to
the
name
of
arden
the
thought
of
all
that
he
could
be
and
do
all
these
things
you
think
should
have
made
him
happy
they
would
have
made
him
happy
but
for
one
thing
all
this
was
won
at
the
expense
of
those
whom
he
loved
best
the
children
who
were
his
dear
cousins
and
playfellows
the
man
their
father
who
had
moved
heaven
and
earth
to
establish
dickie
claim
to
the
title
and
had
been
content
quietly
to
stand
aside
and
give
up
title
castle
lands
and
treasure
to
the
little
cripple
from
deptford
dickie
thought
of
that
and
almost
only
of
that
in
the
days
that
followed
the
life
he
had
led
in
that
when
james
the
first
was
king
seemed
to
him
now
a
very
little
thing
compared
with
the
present
glory
of
being
the
head
of
the
house
of
arden
of
being
the
providence
the
loving
of
all
these
good
peasant
folk
who
loved
his
name
yet
the
thought
of
those
days
when
he
was
plain
richard
arden
son
of
sir
richard
arden
living
in
the
beautiful
house
at
deptford
fretted
at
all
his
joy
in
his
present
state
that
and
the
thought
of
all
he
owed
to
him
who
had
been
lord
of
arden
until
he
came
with
his
lame
foot
and
his
heirship
fretted
his
soul
as
rust
frets
steel
these
people
had
received
him
loved
him
been
kind
to
him
when
he
was
only
a
tramp
boy
and
he
was
repaying
them
by
taking
away
from
them
priceless
possessions
for
so
he
esteemed
the
lordship
of
arden
and
the
old
lands
and
the
old
castle
suppose
he
gave
them
up
the
priceless
possessions
suppose
he
went
away
to
that
sure
retreat
that
was
still
left
him
the
past
it
was
a
sacrifice
to
give
up
the
here
and
now
for
the
far
off
the
almost
forgotten
all
that
happy
other
life
that
had
once
held
all
for
which
he
cared
seemed
thin
and
beside
the
vivid
glories
of
the
life
here
now
yet
he
remembered
how
once
that
life
in
king
time
had
seemed
the
best
thing
in
the
world
and
how
he
had
chosen
to
come
back
from
it
to
help
a
helpless
of
a
tramp
beale
well
he
had
helped
beale
he
had
done
what
he
set
out
to
do
for
beale
sake
he
had
given
up
the
beautiful
life
for
the
sordid
life
and
beale
was
a
new
man
a
man
that
dickie
had
made
surely
now
he
could
give
up
one
beautiful
life
for
another
for
the
sake
of
these
his
flesh
and
blood
who
had
so
readily
so
kindly
so
generously
set
him
in
the
place
that
had
been
theirs
more
and
more
it
came
home
to
dickie
that
this
was
what
he
had
to
do
to
go
back
to
the
times
when
james
the
first
was
king
and
never
to
return
to
these
times
at
all
it
would
be
very
bitter
it
would
be
like
leaving
home
never
to
return
it
was
exile
well
was
richard
lord
arden
to
be
afraid
of
exile
or
of
anything
else
he
must
not
just
disappear
either
or
they
would
search
and
search
for
him
and
never
know
that
he
was
gone
forever
he
must
slip
away
and
let
the
father
of
edred
and
elfrida
be
as
he
had
been
lord
arden
he
must
make
it
appear
that
he
richard
lord
arden
was
dead
he
thought
over
this
very
carefully
but
if
he
seemed
to
be
dead
edred
and
elfrida
would
be
very
unhappy
well
they
should
not
be
unhappy
he
would
tell
them
and
then
they
would
know
that
he
had
behaved
well
and
as
an
arden
should
do
be
hard
on
him
for
longing
for
just
this
little
human
praise
there
are
very
few
of
us
who
can
do
without
it
who
can
bear
not
to
let
some
one
very
near
and
dear
know
that
we
have
behaved
rather
decently
on
those
occasions
when
that
is
what
we
have
done
it
took
dickie
a
long
time
to
think
out
all
this
clearly
and
with
no
mistakes
but
at
last
his
mind
was
made
up
and
then
he
asked
edred
and
elfrida
to
come
up
to
the
cave
with
him
because
he
had
something
to
tell
them
when
they
were
all
there
sitting
on
the
smooth
sand
by
the
underground
stream
dickie
said
look
here
i
not
going
on
being
lord
arden
you
ca
help
it
said
edred
yes
i
can
you
know
how
i
went
and
lived
in
king
james
time
well
i
going
there
again
for
good
illustration
thought
of
nothing
else
for
a
month
said
dickie
you
sha
said
elfrida
i
tell
father
i
thought
of
all
that
dickie
said
and
i
going
to
ask
the
mouldiwarps
to
make
it
so
that
you
tell
i
ca
stay
here
and
feel
that
i
turning
you
and
your
father
out
and
think
what
edred
did
for
me
in
this
very
cave
no
my
mind
made
up
it
was
and
they
could
not
shake
it
but
we
sha
ever
see
you
again
dickie
admitted
that
this
was
so
and
oh
dickie
said
elfrida
with
deep
concern
you
wo
ever
see
us
again
either
think
of
that
whatever
will
you
do
without
us
that
said
dickie
wo
be
so
bad
as
you
think
the
elfrida
and
edred
who
live
in
those
times
are
as
like
you
as
two
pins
no
they
are
really
oh
do
make
it
any
harder
i
got
to
do
it
there
was
that
in
his
voice
which
silenced
and
convinced
them
they
felt
that
he
had
indeed
to
do
it
i
could
never
be
happy
here
never
he
went
on
but
i
shall
be
happy
there
and
you
never
forget
me
though
there
are
one
or
two
things
i
want
you
to
forget
and
i
going
now
oh
not
now
wait
and
think
elfrida
implored
i
thought
of
nothing
else

elfrida

ca
and
i
wo

said
richard
and
stepped
inside
the
crossed
triangles
of
i
wish

slowly

me
these
last
wishes
i
wish
edred
and
elfrida
may

i
wish

year

forget
what
i
have
done
and
let
them
not
be
unhappy
about
me
because
i
shall
be
very
happy
i

he
added
doubtfully
and
paused
oh
dickie
the
other
children
cried
out
together
he
went
on
i
wish
my
uncle
may
restore
the
castle
and
take
care
of
the
poor
people
so
that
there
any
poor
people
and
every
comfortable
just
as
i
meant
to
do
he
took
off
his
cap
and
coat
and
flung
them
outside
the
circle
his
boots
too
i
wish
i
may
go
back
to
james
the
first
time
and
live
out
my
life
there
and
do
honor
in
my
life
and
death
to
the
house
of
arden
the
children
blinked
dickie
and
tinkler
and
the
white
seal
were
gone
and
only
the
empty
ring
of
lay
on
the
sand
shocking
bathing
fatality
the
newspapers
said
lord
arden
drowned
the
body
not
yet
recovered
it
never
was
recovered
of
course
elfrida
and
edred
said
nothing
no
wonder
their
elders
said
the
shock
was
too
great
and
too
sudden
the
father
of
edred
and
elfrida
is
lord
arden
now
he
has
done
all
that
dickie
would
have
done
he
has
made
arden
the
happiest
and
most
prosperous
village
in
england
and
the
stream
beside
which
dickie
bade
farewell
to
his
cousins
flows
a
broad
moat
round
the
waters
of
the
castle
restored
now
to
all
its
own
splendor
there
is
a
tablet
in
the
church
which
tells
of
the
death
by
drowning
of
richard
sixteenth
lord
arden
the
children
read
it
every
sunday
for
a
year
and
knew
that
it
did
not
tell
the
truth
but
by
the
time
the
had
grown
and
flowered
and
shed
their
seeds
in
the
castle
garden
they
ceased
to
know
this
and
talked
often
sadly
and
fondly
of
dear
cousin
dickie
who
was
drowned
and
at
the
same
time
they
ceased
to
remember
that
they
had
ever
been
out
of
their
own
time
into
the
past
so
that
if
they
were
to
read
this
book
they
would
think
it
all
nonsense
and
and
not
in
the
least
recognize
the
story
as
their
own
but
whatever
else
is
forgotten
dickie
is
remembered
and
he
who
gave
up
his
life
here
for
the
sake
of
those
he
loved
will
live
as
long
as
life
shall
beat
in
the
hearts
of
those
who
loved
him
and
dickie
himself
i
see
him
in
his
ruff
and
cloak
with
his
little
sword
by
his
side
living
out
the
life
he
has
chosen
in
the
old
england
when
james
the
first
was
king
i
see
him
growing
in
grace
and
favor
versed
in
book
learning
expert
in
all
noble
sports
and
exercises
for
dickie
is
not
lame
now
i
see
the
roots
of
his
being
taking
fast
hold
of
his
chosen
life
and
the
life
that
he
renounced
receding
receding
till
he
can
hardly
see
it
any
more
i
see
him
a
tall
youth
straight
and
strong
lending
the
old
nurse
his
arm
to
walk
in
the
trim
beautiful
garden
at
deptford
and
i
hear
him
say
when
i
was
a
little
boy
nurse
i
had
mighty
strange
dreams
of
another
life
than
this
forget
them
she
says
dreams
go
to
the
making
of
all
proper
men
but
now
thou
art
a
man
forget
the
dreams
of
thy
childhood
and
play
the
man
to
the
glory
of
god
and
of
the
house
of
arden
and
let
thy
dreams
be
of
the
life
to
come
compared
to
which
all
lives
on
earth
are
only
dreams
and
in
that
life
all
those
who
have
loved
shall
meet
and
be
together
forevermore
in
that
life
when
all
the
dear
and
noble
dreams
of
the
earthly
life
shall
at
last
and
forever
be
something
more
than
dreams
