was
no

on

the

set
out

to

ashe
one
of
the
four
men
peering
unhappily
at
the
display
shook
his
head
slightly
as
if
to
free
his
mind
of
such
cobwebs
his
neighbor
to
the
right
colonel
kelgarries
leaned
forward
to
ask
harshly
no
chance
of
a
mistake
you
saw
the
detector
the
thin
gray
string
of
a
man
behind
the
desk
answered
with
chill
precision
no
no
possible
mistake
these
five
have
definitely
been
snooped
and
two
choices
among
them
ashe
murmured
that
was
the
important
point
now
i
thought
these
were
under
maximum
security
kelgarries

the
gray
man
florian
waldour
remote
expression
did
not
change
every
possible
precaution
was
in
force
there
was
a
sleeper
a
hidden
agent
planted
who
kelgarries
demanded

glanced
around
at
his

james
ruthven
camdon
he
said
hardly
able
to
believe
this
answer
to
which
logic
had
led
him
waldour
nodded
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
known
and
worked
with
kelgarries
ashe
saw
him
display
open
astonishment
camdon
but
he
was
sent
us
by
the
colonel
eyes
narrowed
he
must
have
been
sent
there
were
too
many
cross
checks
to
fake
that
oh
he
was
sent
all
right
for
the
first
time
there
was
a
note
of
emotion
in
waldour
voice
he
was
a
sleeper
a
very
deep
sleeper
they
must
have
planted
him
a
full
or
thirty
years
ago
he
been
just
what
he
claimed
to
be
as
long
as
that
well
he
certainly
was
worth
their
time
and
trouble
was
he
james
ruthven
voice
was
a
growling
rumble
he
sucked
in
thick
lips
continuing
to
stare
at
the
disks
how
long
ago
were
these
snooped
ashe
thoughts
turned
swiftly
from
the
enormity
of
the
betrayal
to
that
important
point
the
time
element
that
was
the
primary
concern
now
that
the
damage
was
done
and
they
knew
it
that
one
thing
we
do
know
waldour
reply
came
slowly
as
if
he
hated
the
admission
we
be
safer
then
if
we
presume
the
very
earliest
period
ruthven
statement
was
as
ruthless
in
its
implications
as
the
shock
they
had
had
when
waldour
announced
the
disaster
eighteen
months
ago
ashe
protested
but
ruthven
was
nodding
camdon
was
in
on
this
from
the
very
first
we
had
the
tapes
in
and
out
for
study
all
that
time
and
the
new
detector
against
snooping
was
not
put
in
service
until
two
weeks
ago
this
case
came
up
on
the
first
checking
round
did
it
he
asked
waldour
first
check
the
security
man
agreed
camdon
left
the
base
six
days
ago
but
he
has
been
in
and
out
on
his
liaison
duties
from
the
first
he
had
to
go
through
those
search
points
every
time
kelgarries
protested
thought
nothing
could
get
through
those
the
colonel
brightened
maybe
he
got
his
snooper
films
and
then
could
take
them
off
base
have
his
quarters
been
turned
out
waldour
lips
lifted
in
a
grimace
of
exasperation
please
colonel
he
said
wearily
this
is
not
a
kindergarten
exercise
in
confirmation
of
his
success
listen
he
touched
a
button
on
his
desk
and
out
of
the
air
came
the
emotionless
chant
of
a
newscaster
fears
for
the
safety
of
lassiter
camdon
space
expediter
for
the
western
conference
space
council
have
been
confirmed
by
the
discovery
of
burned
wreckage
in
the
mountains
camdon
was
returning
from
a
mission
to
the
star
laboratory
when
his
plane
lost
contact
with
ragnor
field
reports
of
a
storm
in
that
vicinity
immediately
raised
concern
waldour
snapped
off
the
voice
true
or
a
cover
for
his
escape
kelgarries
wondered
aloud
could
be
either
they
may
have
deliberately
written
him
off
when
they
had
all
they
wanted
waldour
acknowledged
but
to
get
back
to
our
troubles
ruthven
is
right
to
assume
the
worst
i
believe
we
can
only
insure
the
recovery
of
our
project
by
thinking
that
these
tapes
were
snooped
anywhere
from
eighteen
months
ago
to
last
week
and
we
must
work
accordingly
there
was
silence
in
the
room
as
they
all
considered
that
ashe
slipped
down
in
his
chair
his
thoughts
enmeshed
in
memories
first
there
had
been
operation
retrograde
when
specially
trained
time
agents
had
shuttled
back
and
forth
in
history
striving
to
locate
and
track
down
the
mysterious
source
of
alien
knowledge
which
the
eastern
communistic
nations
had
suddenly
begun
to
use
ashe
himself
and
a
younger
partner
ross
murdock
had
been
part
of
the
final
action
which
had
solved
the
mystery
having
traced
that
source
of
knowledge
not
to
an
earlier
and
forgotten
terran
civilization
but
to
wrecked
spaceships
from
an
galactic
empire
an
empire
which
had
flourished
when
glacial
ice
covered
most
of
europe
and
northern
america
and
terrans
were
primitives
murdock
trapped
by
the
reds
in
one
of
those
wrecked
ships
had
inadvertently
summoned
its
original
owners
who
had
descended
to
trace
through
the
russian
time
stations
the
looters
of
their
wrecks
destroying
the
whole
red
system
but
the
aliens
had
not
chanced
on
the
parallel
western
system
and
a
year
later
that
had
been
put
into
project
folsom
one
again
ashe
murdock
and
a
newcomer
the
apache
travis
fox
had
gone
back
into
time
to
the
arizona
of
the
folsom
hunters
discovering
what
they
wanted
two
ships
one
wrecked
the
other
intact
and
when
the
full
efforts
of
the
project
had
been
centered
on
bringing
the
intact
ship
back
into
the
present
chance
had
triggered
controls
set
by
the
dead
alien
commander
a
party
of
four
ashe
murdock
fox
and
a
technician
had
then
made
an
involuntary
voyage
into
space
touching
three
worlds
on
which
the
galactic
civilization
of
the
far
past
was
now
marked
only
by
ruins
voyage
tape
fed
into
the
controls
of
the
ship
had
taken
the
men
and
when
rewound
had
by
a
miracle
returned
them
to
terra
with
a
cargo
of
similar
tapes
found
in
a
building
on
a
world
which
might
have
been
the
central
capital
for
a
government
comprised
not
of
countries
or
of
worlds
but
of
solar
systems
tapes
each
one
the
key
to
another
planet
and
that
ancient
galactic
knowledge
was
treasure
such
as
the
terrans
had
never
dreamed
of
possessing
though
there
were
the
attendant
fears
that
such
discoveries
could
be
weapons
in
enemy
hands
there
had
been
an
enforced
sharing
with
other
nations
of
tapes
chosen
at
random
at
a
great
drawing
and
each
nation
secretly
remained
convinced
that
in
spite
of
the
untold
riches
it
might
hold
as
a
result
of
chance
its
rivals
had
done
better
right
at
this
moment
ashe
did
not
in
the
least
doubt
there
were
agents
of
his
own
party
intent
on
accomplishing
at
the
red
project
just
what
camdon
had
done
there
however
that
did
not
help
in
solving
their
present
dilemma
concerning
operation
cochise
one
part
of
their
project
but
perhaps
the
most
important
now
some
of
the
tapes
were
duds
either
too
damaged
to
be
useful
or
set
for
worlds
hostile
to
terrans
lacking
the
equipment
the
earlier
race
had
had
at
its
command
of
the
five
tapes
they
now
knew
had
been
snooped
three
would
be
useless
to
the
enemy
but
one
of
the
remaining
two
ashe
frowned
one
was
the
goal
toward
which
they
had
been
working
feverishly
for
a
full
twelve
months
to
plant
a
colony
across
the
gulf
of
space
a
successful
colony
later
to
be
used
as
a
steppingstone
to
other
worlds
so
we
have
to
move
faster
ruthven
comment
reached
ashe
through
his
stream
of
memories
i
thought
you
required
at
least
three
more
months
to
conclude
personnel
training
waldour
observed
ruthven
lifted
a
fat
hand
running
the
nail
of
a
broad
thumb
back
and
forth
across
his
lower
lip
in
a
habitual
gesture
ashe
had
learned
to
mistrust
as
the
latter
stiffened
bracing
for
a
battle
of
wills
he
saw
kelgarries
come
alert
too
at
least
the
colonel
more
often
than
not
was
ready
to
counter
ruthven
demands
we
test
and
we
test
said
the
fat
man
always
we
test
we
move
like
turtles
when
it
would
be
better
to
race
like
greyhounds
there
is
such
a
thing
as
overcaution
as
i
have
said
from
the
first
one
would
think
his
accusing
glance
included
ashe
and
kelgarries
that
there
had
never
been
any
improvising
in
this
project
that
all
had
always
been
done
by
the
book
i
say
that
this
is
the
time
we
must
take
the
big
gamble
or
else
we
may
find
we
have
been
outbid
for
space
entirely
let
those
others
discover
even
one
alien
installation
they
can
master
and
his
thumb
shifted
from
his
lip
grinding
down
on
the
desk
top
as
if
it
were
crushing
some
venturesome
but
entirely
unimportant
insect
and
we
are
finished
before
we
really
begin
there
were
a
number
of
men
in
the
project
who
would
agree
with
that
ashe
knew
and
a
greater
number
in
the
country
and
conference
at
large
the
public
was
used
to
reckless
gambles
which
paid
off
and
there
had
been
enough
of
those
in
the
past
to
give
an
impressive
argument
for
that
point
of
view
but
ashe
himself
could
not
agree
to
a
he
had
been
out
among
the
stars
shaved
disaster
too
closely
because
the
proper
training
had
not
been
given
i
shall
report
that
i
advise
a
within
a
week
ruthven
was
continuing
to
the
council
i
shall
say
that
and
i
do
not
agree
ashe
cut
in
he
glanced
at
kelgarries
for
the
quick
backing
he
expected
but
instead
there
was
a
lengthening
moment
of
silence
then
the
colonel
spread
out
his
hands
and
said
sullenly
i
do
agree
either
but
i
do
have
the
final
ashe
what
would
be
needed
to
speed
up
any
it
was
ruthven
who
replied
we
can
use
the
redax
as
i
have
said
from
the
start
ashe
straightened
his
mouth
tight
his
eyes
hard
and
angry
and
i
protest
that
to
the
council
man
we
dealing
with
human
beings
selected
volunteers
men
who
trust
us
not
with
laboratory
animals
ruthven
thick
lips
pouted
into
what
was
close
to
a
smile
of
derision
always
the
sentimentalists
you
experts
in
the
past
tell
me
ashe
were
you
always
so
thoughtful
of
your
men
when
you
sent
agents
back
into
time
and
certainly
a
voyage
into
space
is
less
a
risk
than
time
travel
these
volunteers
know
what
they
have
signed
for
they
will
be
ready
then
you
propose
telling
them
about
the
use
of
redax
what
it
does
to
a
man
mind
countered
ashe
certainly
they
will
receive
all
necessary
instructions
ashe
was
not
satisfied
and
he
would
have
spoken
again
but
kelgarries
interrupted
if
it
comes
to
that
none
of
us
here
has
any
right
to
make
final
decisions
waldour
has
already
sent
in
his
report
about
the
snoop
have
to
await
orders
from
the
council
ruthven
levered
himself
out
of
his
chair
his
solid
bulk
stretching
his
uniform
coveralls
that
is
correct
colonel
in
the
meantime
i
would
suggest
we
all
check
to
see
what
can
be
done
to
speed
up
each
portion
of
labor
without
another
word
he
tramped
to
the
door
waldour
eyed
the
other
two
with
mounting
impatience
it
was
plain
he
had
work
to
do
and
wanted
them
to
leave
but
ashe
was
reluctant
he
had
a
feeling
that
matters
were
slipping
out
of
his
control
that
he
was
about
to
face
a
crisis
which
was
somehow
worse
than
just
a
major
security
leak
was
the
enemy
always
on
the
other
side
of
the
world
or
could
he
wear
the
same
uniform
even
share
the
same
goals
in
the
outer
corridor
he
still
hesitated
and
kelgarries
a
step
or
so
in
advance
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
impatiently
there
no
use
fighting
our
hands
are
tied
his
words
were
slurred
almost
as
if
he
wanted
to
disown
them
then
you
agree
to
use
the
redax
for
the
second
time
within
the
hour
ashe
felt
as
if
he
had
taken
a
step
only
to
have
firm
earth
turn
into
slippery
shifting
sand
underfoot
it
is
a
matter
of
my
agreeing
it
may
be
a
matter
of
getting
through
or
not
getting
through
now
if
they
had
eighteen
months
or
even
twelve
the
colonel
fingers
balled
into
a
fist
and
be
delayed
by
any
humanitarian
reasoning
then
you
believe
ruthven
will
win
the
council
approval
when
you
are
dealing
with
frightened
men
you
talking
to
ears
closed
to
anything
but
what
they
want
to
hear
after
all
we
ca
prove
that
the
redax
will
be
harmful
but
we
only
used
it
under
rigidly
controlled
conditions
to
speed
up
the
process
would
mean
a
total
disregard
of
those
controls
snapping
a
party
of
men
and
women
back
into
their
racial
past
and
holding
them
there
for
too
long
a
period
ashe
shook
his
head
you
have
been
in
operation
retrograde
from
the
start
and
we
been
remarkably
successful
operating
in
a
different
way
educating
picked
men
to
return
to
certain
points
in
history
where
their
particular
temperaments
and
characteristics
fitted
the
roles
they
were
selected
to
play
yes
and
even
then
we
had
our
percentage
of
failures
but
to
try
this
returning
people
not
physically
into
time
but
and
into
prototypes
of
their
ancestors
that
something
else
again
the
apaches
have
volunteered
and
they
been
passed
by
the
psychologists
and
the
testers
but
they
americans
of
today
not
tribal
nomads
of
two
or
three
hundred
years
ago
if
you
break
down
some
barriers
you
might
just
end
up
breaking
them
all
kelgarries
was
scowling
you
mean
they
might
revert
utterly
have
no
contact
with
the
present
at
all
that
just
what
i
do
mean
education
and
training
yes
but
full
awakening
of
racial
memories
no
the
two
branches
of
conditioning
should
go
slowly
and
hand
in
hand
otherwise
real
trouble
only
we
no
longer
have
the
time
to
go
slow
i
certain
ruthven
will
be
able
to
push
this
through
with
waldour
report
to
back
him
then
we
have
to
warn
fox
and
the
rest
they
must
be
given
a
choice
in
the
matter
ruthven
said
that
would
be
done
the
colonel
did
not
sound
convinced
of
that
ashe
snorted
if
i
hear
him
telling
them
i
believe
it
i
wonder
whether
we
can
ashe
half
turned
and
frowned
at
the
colonel
what
do
you
mean
you
said
yourself
that
we
had
our
failures
in
time
travel
we
expected
those
accepted
them
even
when
they
hurt
when
we
asked
for
volunteers
for
this
project
we
had
to
make
them
understand
that
there
was
a
heavy
element
of
risk
involved
three
teams
of
recruits
the
eskimos
from
point
barren
the
apaches
and
the
islanders
all
picked
because
their
people
had
a
high
survival
rating

different
types
of

well
the

and
the
islanders
matched
to
any
of
the
worlds
on
those
snooped
tapes
but
topaz
is
waiting
for
the
apaches
and
we
may
have
to
move
them
in
there
in
a
hurry
it
a
rotten
gamble
any
way
you
see
it
i
appeal
directly
to
the
council
kelgarries
shrugged
all
right
you
have
my
backing
but
you
believe
such
an
effort
hopeless
you
know
the
merchants
you
have
to
move
fast
if
you
want
to
beat
ruthven
he
probably
on
a
straight
line
now
to
stanton
reese
and
margate
this
is
what
he
has
been
waiting
for
there
are
the
news
syndicates
public
opinion
would
back
us
you
do
mean
that
of
course
kelgarries
was
suddenly
coldly
remote
ashe
flushed
under
the
heavy
brown
which
overlay
his
regular
features
to
threaten
a
silence
break
was
near
blasphemy
here
he
ran
both
hands
down
the
fabric
covering
his
thighs
as
if
to
rub
away
some
soil
on
his
palms
no
he
replied
heavily
his
voice
dull
i
guess
i
do
i
contact
hough
and
hope
for
the
best
meanwhile
kelgarries
spoke
briskly
we
do
what
we
can
to
speed
up
the
program
as
it
now
stands
i
suggest
you
take
off
for
new
york
within
the
hour
me
why
ashe
asked
with
a
trace
of
suspicion
because
i
ca
leave
without
acting
directly
against
orders
and
that
would
put
us
wrong
immediately
you
see
hough
and
talk
to
him
personally
put
it
to
him
straight
he
have
to
have
all
the
facts
if
he
going
to
counter
any
move
from
stanton
before
the
council
you
know
every
argument
we
can
use
and
all
the
proof
on
our
side
and
authority
enough
to
make
it
count
if
i
can
do
all
that
i
will
ashe
was
alert
and
eager
the
colonel
seeing
his
change
of
expression
felt
easier
but
kelgarries
stood
a
moment
watching
ashe
as
he
hurried
down
a
side
corridor
before
he
moved
on
slowly
to
his
own
box
of
office
once
inside
he
sat
for
a
long
unhappy
time
staring
at
the
wall
and
seeing
nothing
but
the
pictures
produced
by
his
thoughts
then
he
pressed
a
button
and
read
off
the
symbols
which
flashed
on
a
small
set
in
his
desk
another
button
pushed
and
he
picked
up
a
hand
mike
to
relay
an
order
which
might
postpone
trouble
for
a
while
ashe
was
far
too
valuable
a
man
to
lose
and
his
emotions
could
boil
him
straight
into
disaster
over
this
bidwell
reschedule
team
a
they
are
to
go
to
the
instead
of
the
reserve
in
ten
minutes
releasing
the
mike
he
again
stared
at
the
wall
no
one
dared
interrupt
a
period
and
this
one
would
last
three
hours
ashe
could
not
possibly
see
the
trainees
before
he
left
for
new
york
and
that
would
remove
one
temptation
from
his
path
he
would
not
talk
at
the
wrong
time
kelgarries
mouth
twisted
sourly
he
had
no
pride
in
what
he
was
doing
and
he
was
perfectly
certain
that
ruthven
would
win
and
that
fears
of
redax
were
well
founded
it
all
came
back
to
the
old
basic
tenet
of
the
service
the
end
justified
the
means
they
must
use
every
method
and
man
under
their
control
to
make
sure
that
topaz
would
remain
a
western
possession
even
though
that
strange
planet
now
swung
far
beyond
the
sky
which
covered
both
the
western
and
eastern
alliances
on
terra
time
had
run
out
too
fast
they
were
being
forced
to
play
what
cards
they
held
even
though
those
might
be
very
low
ones
ashe
would
be
back
but
not
kelgarries
hoped
until
this
had
been
decided
one
way
or
another
not
until
this
was
finished
finished
kelgarries
blinked
at
the
wall
perhaps
were
finished
too
no
one
would
know
until
the
transport
ship
landed
on
that
other
world
which
appeared
on
the
direction
tape
symbolized
by
a
jewellike
disk
of
which
had
given
it
the
code
name
of
topaz
there
were
an
even
dozen
of
the
guardians
each
following
the
swing
of
its
own
orbital
path
just
within
the
atmospheric
envelope
of
the
planet
which
glowed
as
a
great
gem
in
the
system
of
a
yellow
star
the
globes
had
been
launched
to
form
a
web
of
protection
around
topaz
six
months
earlier
and
the
highest
skill
had
gone
into
their
production
just
as
contact
mines
sown
in
a
harbor
could
close
that
landfall
to
ships
not
knowing
the
secret
channel
so
was
this
world
supposedly
closed
to
any
spaceship
not
equipped
with
the
signal
to
ward
off
the
sphere
missiles
that
was
the
theory
of
the
new
settlers
whose
protection
they
were
to
be
already
tested
as
well
as
possible
but
as
yet
not
put
to
the
ultimate
proof
the
small
bright
globes
spun
undisturbed
across
a
sky
at
night
and
made
reassuring
blips
on
an
installation
screen
by
day
then
a
thirteenth
object
winked
into
being
began
the
encircling
closing
spiral
of
descent
a
sphere
resembling
the
it
was
a
hundred
times
their
size
and
its
orbit
was
purposefully
controlled
by
instruments
under
the
eye
and
hand
of
a
human
pilot
four
men
were
strapped
down
on
cushioned
in
the
control
cabin
of
the
western
alliance
ship
two
hanging
where
their
fingers
might
reach
buttons
and
levers
the
others
merely
passengers
their
own
labor
waiting
for
the
time
when
they
would
set
down
on
the
alien
soil
of
topaz
the
planet
hung
there
in
their
richly
beautiful
in
its
amber
gold
growing
larger
nearer
so
that
they
could
pick
out
features
of
seas
continents
mountain
ranges
which
had
been
studied
on
tape
until
they
were
familiar
yet
now
were
strangely
unfamiliar
too
one
of
the
alerted
oscillated
in
its
set
path
whirled
faster
as
its
delicate
interior
mechanisms
responded
to
the
awakening
spark
which
would
send
it
on
its
mission
of
destruction
a
relay
clicked
but
for
the
smallest
fraction
of
a
millimeter
failed
to
set
the
proper
course
on
the
instrument
far
below
which
checked
the
new
course
the
mistake
was
not
noted
the
screen
of
the
ship
spiraling
toward
topaz
registered
a
path
which
would
bring
it
into
violent
contact
with
the
globe
they
were
still
some
hundreds
of
miles
apart
when
the
alarm
rang
the
pilot
hand
clawed
out
at
the
bank
of
controls
under
the
almost
intolerable
pressure
of
their
descent
there
was
so
little
he
could
do
his
crooked
fingers
fell
back
powerlessly
from
the
buttons
and
levers
his
mouth
was
a
twisted
grimace
of
bleak
acceptance
as
the
beat
of
the
signal
increased
one
of
the
passengers
forced
his
head
around
on
the
padded
rest
fought
to
form
words
to
speak
to
his
companion
the
other
was
staring
ahead
at
the
screen
his
thick
lips
wide
and
flat
against
his
teeth
in
a
snarl
of
rage
they
are
here
ruthven
paid
no
attention
to
the
obvious
as
stated
by
his
fellow
scientist
his
fury
was
a
red
pulsing
thing
inside
him
fed
by
his
own
helplessness
to
be
pinned
here
so
near
his
goal
fastened
up
as
a
target
for
an
inanimate
but
cunningly
fashioned
weapon
ate
into
him
like
a
stream
of
deadly
acid
his
big
gamble
would
puff
out
in
a
blast
of
fire
to
light
up
topaz
sky
with
nothing
left
nothing
on
the
armrest
of
his
his
nails
scratched
deep
the
four
men
in
the
control
cabin
could
only
sit
and
watch
waiting
for
the
rendezvous
which
would
blot
them
out
ruthven
flaming
anger
was
a
futile
blaze
his
companion
in
the
passenger
seat
had
closed
his
eyes
his
lips
moving
soundlessly
in
an
expression
of
his
own
scattered
thoughts
the
pilot
and
his
assistant
divided
their
attention
between
the
screen
with
its
appalling
message
and
the
controls
they
could
not
effectively
use
feverishly
seeking
a
way
out
in
these
last
moments
below
them
in
the
bowl
of
the
ship
were
those
who
would
not
know
the
end
consciously
save
in
one
compartment
in
a
padded
cage
a
head
stirred
where
it
rested
on
forepaws
slitted
eyes
blinked
aware
not
only
of
familiar
surroundings
but
also
of
the
tension
and
fear
generated
by
human
minds
and
emotions
levels
above
a
pointed
nose
raised
and
there
was
a
growling
deep
in
a
throat
covered
with
thick
hair
the
growl
aroused
another
similar
captive
knowing
yellow
eyes
met
yellow
eyes
an
intelligence
which
was
certainly
not
that
of
the
animal
body
which
contained
it
fought
down
instinct
raging
to
send
both
those
bodies
hurtling
at
the
fastenings
of
the
twin
cages
curiosity
and
the
ability
to
adapt
had
been
bred
into
both
from
time
immemorial
then
something
else
had
been
added
to
sly
and
cunning
brains
a
step
up
had
been
taken
to
weld
intelligence
to
cunning
connect
thought
to
instinct
more
than
a
generation
earlier
mankind
had
chosen
barren
desert
the
white
sands
of
new
mexico
as
a
testing
ground
for
atomic
experiments
humankind
could
be
barred
warded
out
of
the
radiation
limits
the
natural
desert
dwellers
and
winged
could
not
be
so
controlled
for
thousands
of
years
since
the
first
southward
roving
amerindian
tribes
had
met
with
their
kind
there
had
been
a
hunter
of
the
open
country
a
smaller
cousin
of
the
wolf
whose
natural
abilities
had
made
an
undeniable
impression
on
the
human
mind
he
was
in
countless
indian
legends
as
the
shaper
or
the
trickster
sometimes
friend
sometimes
enemy
godling
for
some
tribes
father
of
all
evil
for
others
in
the
wealth
of
tales
the
coyote
above
all
other
animals
had
a
firm
place
driven
by
the
press
of
civilization
into
the
badlands
and
deserts
fought
with
poison
gun
and
trap
the
coyote
had
survived
adapting
to
new
ways
with
all
his
legendary
cunning
those
who
had
reviled
him
as
vermin
had
unwillingly
added
to
the
folklore
which
surrounded
him
telling
their
own
tales
of
robbed
traps
skillful
escapes
he
continued
to
be
a
trickster
laughing
on
moonlit
nights
from
the
tops
of
ridges
at
those
who
would
hunt
him
down
then
close
to
the
end
of
the
twentieth
century
when
myths
were
scoffed
at
the
stories
of
the
coyote
slyness
began
once
more
on
a
fantastic
scale
and
finally
scientists
were
sufficiently
intrigued
to
seek
out
this
creature
that
seemed
to
display
in
truth
all
the
abilities
credited
to
his
immortal
namesake
by
tribes
what
they
discovered
was
indeed
shattering
to
certain
closed
minds
for
the
coyote
had
not
only
adapted
to
the
country
of
the
white
sands
he
had
evolved
into
something
which
could
not
be
dismissed
as
an
animal
clever
and
cunning
but
limited
to

six
cubs
had
been
brought
back
on
the
first
expedition

now
in

their
mutated
senses
alert
ready
for
the
slightest
chance
of
escape
sent
to
topaz
as
eyes
and
ears
for
less
keenly
endowed
humans
they
were
not
completely
under
the
domination
of
man
the
range
of
their
mental
powers
was
still
uncomprehended
by
those
who
had
bred
trained
and
worked
with
them
from
the
days
their

had
opened

they
had
taken

wobbly

away

growled
again

back
in

could
not

still
crouched
belly
flat
on
the
protecting
pads
of

he
strove
now
to
wriggle

under

the

who
had
arbitrarily
set
them
so

only
assume
they
were
actually
reliving
the

late
eighteenth
and

nineteenth
centuries
above

the

been
a
addition
an
experiment
which
had
only
had
partial
testing
to
use
it
was
the
final
move
he
could
make
and
he
was
already
half
convinced
of
its
uselessness
with
no
faith
and
only
a
very
wan
hope
he
sent
that
round
of
metal
flush
with
the
board
what
followed
no
one
ever
lived
to
explain
on
the
planet
the
installation
which
tracked
the
missiles
flashed
on
a
screen
bright
enough
to
blind
momentarily
the
duty
man
on
watch
and
its
tracker
was
shaken
off
course
when
it
jiggled
back
into
line
it
was
no
longer
the
efficient
it
had
been
though
its
tenders
were
not
to
realize
that
for
an
important
minute
or
two
while
the

now
out
of

sped
in
dizzy
whirls
toward

bubbling
from

every
shallow
breath
he
could
draw
fought
the
stealthy
tide
of
blackness
which
crept
up
his
brain
his
stubborn
will
holding
to
rags
of
consciousness
refusing
to
acknowledge
the
pain
of
his
fatally
injured
body
the
orbiting
ship
was
on
an
erratic
path
slowly
the
machines
were
correcting
relays
clicking
striving
to
bring
it
to
a
landing
under
all
the
ingenuity
built
into
a
mechanical

bad

the

was
now
between
it
and
the
base
from
which
the

had
been
launched
and
the

had
not
been
recorded
on

far
as

several
hundred
miles
away
knew

in

performed

promised
their
first

of

had
proven
satisfactory

there
had
been
no

of

pawed
at

no

to
suppress

tore
out
of
him
time
held

drove
him
he
rolled
from
his
seat
to
the
floor
lay
there
gasping
as
again
he
fought
doggedly
to
remain
above
the
waves
those
frightening
waves
of
dark
faintness
somehow
he
was
crawling
crawling
along
a
tilted
surface
until
he
gained
the
well
where
the
ladder
to
the
lower
section
hung
now
at
an
acute
angle
it
was
that
angle
which
helped
him
to
the
next
level
he
was
too
dazed
to
realize
the
meaning
of
the
crumpled
bulkheads
there
was
a
spur
of
bare
rock
under
his
hands
as
he
edged
over
and
around
twisted
metal
the
moans
were
now
a
gobbling
burbling
almost
continuous
cry
as
he
reached
his
goal
a
small
cabin
still
intact
for
long
moments
of
anguish
he
paused
by
the
chair
there
afraid
that
he
could
not
make
the
last
effort
raise
his
almost
inert
bulk
up
to
the
point
where
he
could
reach
the
redax
release
for
a
second
of
unusual
clarity
he
wondered
if
there
was
any
reason
for
this
supreme
ordeal
whether
any
of
the
sleepers
could
be
aroused
this
might
now
be
a
ship
of
the
dead
his
right
hand
his
arm
and
finally
his
bulk
over
the
seat
he
braced
himself
and
brought
his
left
hand
up
he
could
not
use
any
of
the
fingers
it
was
like
lifting
numb
heavy
weights
but
he
lurched
forward
swept
the
unfeeling
lump
of
cold
flesh
down
against
the
release
in
a
gesture
which
he
knew
must
be
his
final
move
and
as
he
fell
back
to
the
floor
ruthven
could
not
be
certain
whether
he
had
succeeded
or
failed
he
tried
to
screw
his
head
around
to
focus
his
eyes
upward
at
that
switch
was
it
down
or
still
stubbornly
up
locking
the
sleepers
into
confinement
but
there
was
a
fog
between
he
could
not
see
it
or
anything
the
light
in
the
cabin
flickered
was
gone
as
another
circuit
in
the
broken
ship
failed
it
was
dark
too
in
the
small
cubby
below
which
housed
the
two
cages
chance
which
had
snuffed
out
nineteen
lives
in
the
space
globe
had
missed
ripping
open
that
cabin
on
the
mountain
side
five
yards
down
the
corridor
the
outside
fabric
of
the
ship
was
split
wide
open
the
crisp
air
native
to
topaz
entering
sending
a
message
to
two
keen
noses
through
the
combination
of
odors
now
pervading
the
wreckage
and
the
male
coyote
went
into
action
days
ago
he
had
managed
to
work
loose
the
lower
end
of
the
mesh
which
fronted
his
cage
but
his
mind
had
told
him
that
a
sortie
inside
the
ship
was
valueless
the
odd
rapport
he
had
with
the
human
brains
unknown
to
them
had
operated
to
keep
him
to
the
old
role
of
cunning
deception
which
in
the
past
had
saved
countless
of
his
species
from
sudden
and
violent
death
now
with
teeth
and
paws
he
went
diligently
to
work
urged
on
by
the
whines
of
his
mate
that
tantalizing
smell
of
an
outside
world
tickling
their
nostrils
a
wild
world
lacking
the
taint
of
he
slipped
under
the
loosened
mesh
and
stood
up
to
paw
at
the
front
of
the
female
cage
one
forepaw
caught
in
the
latch
and
pressed
it
down
and
the
weight
of
the
door
swung
against
him
together
they
were
free
now
to
reach
the
corridor
and
see
ahead
the
subdued
light
of
a
strange
moon
beckoning
them
on
into
the
open
the
female
always
more
cautious
than
her
mate
lingered
behind
as
he
trotted
forward
his
ears
with
curiosity
their
training
had
been
the
same
since
cubhood
to
range
and
explore
but
always
in
the
company
and
at
the
order
of
man
this
was
not
according
to
the
pattern
she
knew
and
she
was
suspicious
but
to
her
sensitive
nose
the
smell
of
the
ship
was
an
offense
and
the
puffs
of
breeze
from
without
enticing
her
mate
had
already
slipped
through
the
break
now
he
barked
with
excitement
and
wonder
and
she
trotted
on
to
join
him
above
the
redax
which
had
never
been
intended
to
stand
rough
usage
proved
to
be
a
better
survivor
of
the
crash
than
most
of
the
other
installations
power
purred
along
a
network
of
lines
activated
beams
turned
off
and
on
a
series
of
fixtures
in
those
for
five
of
the
sleepers
nothing
the
cabin
which
had
held
them
was
a
flattened
smear
against
the
mountain
side
three
more
half
aroused
choked
fought
for
life
and
breath
in
a
darkness
which
was
a
mercifully
short
nightmare
and
succumbed
but
in
the
cabin
nearest
the
rent
through
which
the
coyotes
had
escaped
a
young
man
sat
up
abruptly
looking
into
the
dark
with
eyes
he
clawed
for
purchase
against
the
smooth
edge
of
the
box
in
which
he
had
lain
somehow
got
to
his
knees
weaving
weakly
back
and
forth
and
half
fell
half
pushed
to
the
floor
where
he
could
stand
only
by
keeping
his
hold
on
the
box
dazed
sick
weak
he
swayed
there
aware
only
of
himself
and
his
own
sensations
there
were
small
sounds
in
the
dark
a
stilled
moan
a
gasping
sigh
but
that
meant
nothing
within
him
grew
a
compulsion
to
be
out
of
this
place
his
terror
making
him
lurch
forward
his
flailing
hand
rapped
painfully
against
an
upright
surface
which
his
questing
fingers
identified
hazily
as
an
exit
unconsciously
he
fumbled
along
the
surface
of
the
door
until
it
gave
under
that
weak
pressure
then
he
was
out
his
head
swimming
drawn
by
the
light
behind
the
wall
rent
he
progressed
toward
that
in
a
scrambling
crawl
making
his
way
over
the
splintered
skin
of
the
globe
then
he
dropped
with
a
jarring
thud
onto
the
mound
of
earth
the
ship
had
pushed
before
it
during
its
downward
slide
limply
he
tumbled
on
in
a
small
cascade
of
clods
and
sand
hitting
against
a
less
movable
rock
with
force
enough
to
roll
him
over
on
his
back
and
stun
him
again
the
second
and
smaller
moon
of
topaz
swung
brightly
through
the
sky
its
weird
green
rays
making
the
face
of
the
explorer
an
alien
mask
it
had
passed
well
on
to
the
horizon
and
its
large
yellow
companion
had
risen
when
a
yapping
broke
the
small
sounds
of
the
night
as
the
yipp
arose
in
a
crescendo
the
man
stirred
putting
one
hand
to
his
head
his
eyes
opened
he
looked
vaguely
about
him
and
sat
up
behind
him
was
the
torn
and
ripped
ship
but
he
did
not
look
back
at
it
instead
he
got
to
his
feet
and
staggered
out
into
the
direct
path
of
the
moonlight
inside
his
brain
there
was
a
whirl
of
thoughts
memories
emotions
perhaps
ruthven
or
one
of
his
assistants
could
have
explained
that
chaotic
mixture
for
what
it
was
but
for
all
practical
purposes
travis
fox
amerindian
time
agent
member
of
team
a
operation
cochise
was
far
less
of
a
thinking
animal
now
than
the
two
coyotes
paying
their
ritual
addresses
to
a
moon
which
was
not
the
one
of
their
vanished
homeland
travis
wavered
on
drawn
somehow
by
that
howling
it
was
familiar
a
thread
of
something
real
through
all
the
broken
clutter
in
his
head
he
stumbled
fell
crawled
up
again
but
he
kept
on
above
the
female
coyote
lowered
her
head
drew
a
test
sniff
of
a
new
scent
she
recognized
that
as
part
of
the
proper
way
of
life
she
yapped
once
at
her
mate
but
he
was
absorbed
in
his
night
song
his
muzzle
pointed
moonward
as
he
voiced
a
fine
wailing
travis
tripped
pitched
forward
on
his
hands
and
knees
and
felt
the
jar
of
such
a
landing
shoot
up
his
stiffened
forearms
he
tried
to
get
up
but
his
body
only
twisted
so
he
landed
on
his
back
and
lay
looking
up
at
the
moon
a
strong
familiar
odor
then
a
shadow
looming
above
him
hot
breath
against
his
cheek
and
the
swift
sweep
of
an
animal
tongue
on
his
face
he
flung
up
his
hand
gripped
thick
fur
and
held
on
as
if
he
had
found
one
anchor
of
sanity
in
a
world
gone
completely
mad
travis
one
knee
braced
against
the
red
earth
blinked
as
he
parted
a
screen
of
tall
grass
with
cautious
fingers
to
look
out
into
a
valley
where
golden
mist
clouded
most
of
the
landscape
his
head
ached
with
dull
persistence
the
pain
fostered
in
some
way
by
his
own
bewilderment
to
study
the
land
ahead
was
like
trying
to
see
through
one
picture
interposed
over
another
and
far
different
one
he
knew
what
ought
to
be
there
but
what
was
before
him
was
very
dissimilar
a
shape
flitted
through
the
tall
cover
grass
and
travis
tensed
coyote
or
were
these
companions
of
his
actually
spirits
who
could
choose
their
shape
at
will
and
had
oddly
this
time
assumed
the
bodies
of
man
tricky
enemy
were
they
enemies
or
allies
in
this
mad
world
he
did
not
know
his
mind
formed
a
word
he
did
not
speak
friend
yellow
eyes
met
his
directly
dimly
he
had
been
aware
ever
since
awaking
in
this
strange
wilderness
with
the
coming
of
morning
light
that
the
ones
trotting
with
him
as
he
walked
aimlessly
had
unbeastlike
traits
not
only
did
they
face
him
but
in
some
ways
they
appeared
able
to
read
his
thoughts
he
had
longed
for
water
to
ease
the
burning
in
his
throat
the
pain
in
his
head
and
the
creatures
had
nudged
him
in
another
direction
bringing
him
to
a
pool
where
he
had
mouthed
liquid
with
a
strange
sweet
but
not
unpleasant
taste
now
he
had
given
them
names
names
which
had
come
out
of
the
welter
of
dreams
which
shadowed
his
stumbling
journey
across
this
weird
country
was
the
female
who
continued
to
shepherd
him
along
never
venturing
too
far
from
his
side
naginlta
was
the
male
who
did
just
that
disappearing
at
long
intervals
and
then
returning
to
face
the
man
and
his
mate
as
if
conveying
some
report
necessary
to
their
journey
it
was
who
sought
out
travis
now
her
red
tongue
lolling
from
her
mouth
as
she
panted
not
from
exertion
he
was
certain
of
that
no
she
was
excited
and
eager
on
the
hunt
that
was
it
a
hunt
travis
own
tongue
ran
across
his
lips
as
an
impression
hit
him
with
feral
force
there
was
meat
rich
fresh
just
ahead
meat
that
lived
waiting
to
be
killed
inside
him
his
own
avid
hunger
roused
shaking
him
farther
out
of
the
crusting
dream
his
hands
went
to
his
waist
but
the
groping
fingers
did
not
find
what
vague
memory
told
him
should
be
there
a
belt
heavy
with
knife
in
sheath
he
examined
his
own
body
with
attention
to
find
he
was
adequately
covered
by
breeches
of
a
smooth
dull
brown
material
which
blended
well
with
the
vegetation
about
him
he
wore
a
loose
shirt
belted
in
at
the
narrow
waist
by
a
folded
strip
of
cloth
the
ends
of
which
fluttered
free
on
his
feet
were
tall
moccasins
the
leg
pieces
extending
some
distance
up
his
calves
the
toes
turned
up
in
rounded
points
some
of
this
he
found
familiar
but
these
were
fragments
of
memory
again
his
mind
fitted
one
picture
above
another
one
thing
he
did
know
for
sure
he
had
no
weapons
and
that
realization
struck
home
with
a
thrust
of
real
and
terrible
fear
which
tore
away
more
of
the
bewilderment
cloaking
his
mind
was
impatient
having
advanced
a
step
or
two
she
now
looked
back
at
him
over
her
shoulder
yellow
eyes
slitted
her
demand
on
him
as
instant
and
real
as
if
she
had
voiced
understandable
words
meat
was
waiting
and
she
was
hungry
also
she
expected
travis
to
aid
in
the
hunt
at
once
though
he
could
not
match
her
fluid
grace
in
moving
through
the
grass
travis
followed
her
keeping
to
cover
he
shook
his
head
vigorously
in
spite
of
the
stab
of
pain
the
motion
cost
him
and
paid
more
attention
to
his
surroundings
it
was
apparent
that
the
earth
under
him
the
grass
around
the
valley
of
the
golden
haze
were
all
real
not
part
of
a
dream
therefore
that
other
countryside
which
he
kept
seeing
in
a
ghostly
fashion
was
a
hallucination
even
the
air
which
he
drew
into
his
lungs
and
expelled
again
had
a
strange
smell
or
was
it
taste
he
could
not
be
sure
which
he
knew
that
could
produce
queer
side
effects
but
this
travis
paused
staring
unseeingly
before
him
at
the
grass
still
waving
from
the
coyote
passage
what
was
that
now
three
pictures
fought
to
focus
in
his
mind
the
two
landscapes
which
did
not
match
and
a
shadowy
third
he
shook
his
head
again
his
hands
to
his
temples
this
this
only
was
real
the
ground
the
grass
the
valley
the
hunger
in
him
the
hunt
waiting
he
forced
himself
to
concentrate
on
the
immediate
present
and
the
portion
of
world
he
could
see
feel
scent
which
lay
here
and
now
about
him
the
grass
grew
shorter
as
he
proceeded
in
wake
but
the
haze
was
not
thinning
it
seemed
to
hang
in
patches
and
when
he
ventured
through
the
edge
of
a
patch
it
was
like
creeping
through
a
fog
of
golden
dancing
motes
with
here
and
there
a
glittering
speck
whirling
and
darting
like
a
living
thing
masked
by
the
stuff
travis
reached
a
line
of
brush
and
sniffed
it
was
a
warm
scent
a
heavy
odor
he
could
not
identify
and
yet
one
he
associated
with
a
living
creature
flat
to
earth
he
pushed
head
and
shoulders
under
the
low
limbs
of
the
bush
to
look
ahead
here
was
a
space
where
the
fog
did
not
hold
a
pocket
of
earth
clear
under
the
morning
sun
and
grazing
there
were
three
animals
again
shock
cleared
a
portion
of
travis
bemused
brain
they
were
about
the
size
he
thought
of
antelopes
and
they
had
a
general
resemblance
to
those
beasts
in
that
they
had
four
slender
legs
a
rounded
body
and
a
head
but
they
had
alien
features
so
alien
as
to
hold
him
in
amazement
the
bodies
had
bare
spots
here
and
there
and
patches
of
creamy
fur
or
was
it
hair
which
hung
in
strips
as
if
the
creatures
had
been
partially
plucked
in
a
careless
fashion
the
necks
were
long
and
moved
about
in
a
serpentine
motion
as
though
their
spines
were
as
limber
as
reptiles
on
the
end
of
those
long
and
twisting
necks
were
heads
which
also
appeared
more
suitable
to
another
species
broad
rather
flat
with
a
singular
toadlike
look
but
furnished
with
horns
set
halfway
down
the
nose
horns
which
began
in
a
single
root
and
then
branched
into
two
sharp
points
they
were
unearthly
again
travis
blinked
brought
his
hand
up
to
his
head
as
he
continued
to
view
the
browsers
there
were
three
of
them
two
larger
and
with
horns
the
other
a
smaller
beast
with
less
of
the
ragged
fur
and
only
the
beginning
button
of
a
protuberance
on
the
nose
it
was
probably
a
calf
one
of
those
mental
alerts
from
the
coyotes
broke
his
absorption
was
not
interested
in
the
odd
appearance
of
the
grazing
creatures
she
was
intent
upon
their
usefulness
in
another
way
as
a
full
and
satisfying
meal
and
she
was
again
impatient
with
him
for
his
dull
response
his
examination
took
a
more
practical
turn
an
antelope
defense
was
speed
though
it
could
be
tricked
into
hunting
range
through
its
inordinate
curiosity
the
slender
legs
of
these
beasts
suggested
a
like
degree
of
speed
and
travis
had
no
weapons
at
all
those
nose
horns
had
an
ugly
look
this
thing
might
be
a
fighter
rather
than
a
runner
but
the
suggestion
which
had
flashed
from
coyote
to
him
had
taken
root
travis
was
hungry
he
was
a
hunter
and
here
was
meat
on
the
hoof
queer
as
it
looked
again
he
received
a
message
naginlta
was
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
clearing
if
the
creatures
depended
on
speed
then
travis
believed
they
could
probably
outrun
not
only
him
but
the
coyotes
as
well
which
left
cunning
and
some
sort
of
plan
travis
glanced
at
the
cover
where
he
knew
crouched
and
from
which
had
come
that
flash
of
agreement
he
shivered
these
were
truly
no
animals
but
of
power
and
as
he
must
treat
them
accede
to
their
will
spurred
by
that
the
apache
gave
only
flicks
of
attention
to
the
browsers
while
at
the
same
time
he
studied
the
part
of
the
landscape
uncovered
by
mist
without
weapons
or
speed
they
must
conceive
a
trap
again
travis
sensed
that
agreement
which
was
magic
and
with
it
the
strong
impression
urging
him
to
the
right
he
was
making
progress
with
skill
he
did
not
even
recognize
and
which
he
had
never
been
conscious
of
learning
the
bushes
and
small
trees
their
branches
not
clothed
with
leaves
from
proper
twigs
but
with
a
reddish
bristly
growth
protruding
directly
from
their
surfaces
made
a
partial
wall
for
the
meadow
that
screen
reached
a
rocky
cleft
where
the
mist
curled
in
a
long
tongue
through
a
wall
twice
travis
height
if
the
browsers
could
be
maneuvered
into
taking
the
path
through
that
cleft
travis
searched
about
him
and
his
hands
closed
upon
the
oldest
weapon
of
his
species
a
stone
pulled
from
an
earth
pocket
and
balanced
neatly
in
the
palm
of
his
hand
it
was
a
long
chance
but
his
best
one
the
apache
took
the
first
step
on
a
new
and
fearsome
road
these
had
put
their
thoughts
or
their
desires
into
his
mind
could
he
so
contact
them
in
return
with
the
stone
clenched
in
his
fist
his
shoulders
back
against
the
wall
not
too
far
from
the
cleft
opening
travis
strove
to
think
out
clearly
and
simply
this
poor
plan
of
his
he
did
not
know
that
he
was
reacting
the
way
scientists
deep
space
away
had
hoped
he
might
nor
did
travis
guess
that
at
this
point
he
had
already
traveled
far
beyond
the
expectations
of
the
men
who
had
bred
and
trained
the
two
mutant
coyotes
he
only
believed
that
this
might
be
the
one
way
he
could
obey
the
wishes
of
the
two
spirits
he
thought
far
more
powerful
than
any
man
so
he
pictured
in
his
mind
the
cleft
the
running
creatures
and
the
part
the
could
play
if
they
so
willed
assent
in
its
way
as
loud
and
clear
as
if
shouted
the
man
fingered
the
stone
weighed
it
there
would
probably
be
just
one
moment
when
he
could
use
it
to
effect
and
he
must
be
ready
from
this
point
he
could
no
longer
see
the
small
meadow
where
the
grazers
were
but
travis
knew
as
well
as
if
he
watched
the
scene
that
the
coyotes
were
creeping
in
belly
flat
to
earth
adding
a
feline
stealth
and
patience
to
their
own
cunning
there
travis
head
jerked
the
alert
had
come
the
drive
was
beginning
he
tensed
gripping
his
stone
a
yapping
bark
was
answered
by
a
sound
he
could
not
describe
a
noise
which
was
neither
cough
nor
grunt
but
a
combination
of
both
again
a
a
burst
through
the
screen
of
brush
the
double
horn
on
its
nose
festooned
with
a
length
of
grass
torn
up
by
the
roots
wide
eyes
milky
and
seeming
to
be
without
pupils
fastened
on
travis
but
he
could
not
be
sure
the
thing
saw
him
for
it
kept
on
picking
up
speed
as
it
approached
the
cleft
behind
it
ran
the
calf
and
that
guttural
cry
was
bubbling
from
its
broad
flat
lips
the
long
neck
of
the
adult
writhed
the
swung
closer
to
the
ground
so
that
the
twin
points
of
the
horn
were
at
a
slant
aimed
now
at
travis
he
had
been
right
in
his
guess
at
their
deadliness
but
he
had
only
a
fleeting
chance
to
recognize
that
fact
as
the
thing
bore
down
its
whole
attitude
expressing
the
firm
intention
of
goring
him
he
hurled
his
stone
and
then
flung
his
body
to
one
side
stumbling
and
rolling
into
the
brush
where
he
fought
madly
to
regain
his
feet
expecting
at
any
moment
to
feel
trampling
hoofs
and
thrusting
horns
there
was
a
crash
to
his
right
and
the
bushes
and
grass
were
wildly
shaken
on
his
hands
and
knees
the
apache
retreated
his
head
turned
to
watch
behind
him
he
saw
the
flirt
of
a
triangular
in
the
mouth
of
the
cleft
the
calf
had
escaped
and
now
the
threshing
in
the
bushes
stilled
was
the
thing
stalking
him
he
got
to
his
feet
for
the
first
time
hearing
clearly
the
continued
yapping
as
if
a
battle
was
in
progress
then
the
second
of
the
adult
beasts
came
into
view
backing
and
turning
trying
to
keep
lowered
head
with
menacing
double
horn
always
pointed
to
the
coyotes
dancing
a
teasing
worrying
circle
about
it
one
of
the
coyotes
flung
up
its
head
looked
upslope
and
barked
then
as
one
both
rushed
the
fighting
beast
but
for
the
first
time
from
the
same
side
leaving
it
a
clear
path
to
retreat
it
made
a
rush
before
which
they
fled
easily
and
then
it
whirled
with
a
speed
and
grace
which
did
not
fit
its
ungainly
body
and
jumped
toward
the
cleft
the
coyotes
making
no
effort
to
hinder
its
escape
travis
came
out
of
cover
approaching
the
brush
which
had
concealed
the
crash
of
the
other
animal
the
actions
of
the
coyotes
had
convinced
him
that
there
was
no
danger
now
they
would
never
have
allowed
the
escape
of
their
prey
had
the
first
beast
not
been
in
difficulties
his
shot
with
the
stone
the
apache
decided
as
he
stood
moments
later
surveying
the
twitching
crumpled
body
must
have
hit
the
thing
in
the
head
stunning
it
then
the
momentum
of
its
charge
had
carried
it
full
force
against
the
rock
to
kill
it
blind
luck
or
the
power
of
the
he
pulled
back
as
the
coyotes
came
padding
up
shoulder
to
shoulder
to
inspect
the
kill
it
was
truly
more
theirs
than
his
their
prey
yielded
not
only
food
but
a
weapon
for
travis
instead
of
the
belt
knife
he
had
remembered
having
he
was
now
equipped
with
two
the
double
horn
had
been
easy
to
free
from
the
shattered
skull
and
some
careful
work
with
stones
had
broken
off
one
prong
at
just
the
angle
he
wanted
so
now
he
had
a
short
and
a
longer
tool
defense
at
least
they
were
better
than
the
stone
with
which
he
had
entered
the
hunt
pushed
past
him
to
lap
daintily
at
the
water
then
she
sat
up
on
her
haunches
watching
travis
as
he
smoothed
the
horn
with
a
stone
a
knife
he
said
to
her
this
will
be
a
knife
and
he
glanced
up
measuring
the
value
of
the
wood
represented
by
trees
and
bushes
then
a
bow
with
a
bow
we
shall
hunt
better
the
coyote
yawned
her
yellow
eyes
half
closed
her
whole
pose
one
of
satisfaction
and
contentment
a
knife
travis
repeated
and
a
bow
he
needed
weapons
he
had
to
have
them
why
his
hand
stopped
scraping
why
the
double
horn
had
been
quick
to
attack
but
travis
could
have
avoided
it
and
it
had
not
hunted
him
first
why
was
he
ridden
by
this
fear
that
he
must
not
be
unarmed
he
dipped
his
hand
into
the
pool
of
the
spring
and
lifted
the
water
to
cool
his
sweating
face
the
coyote
moved
turned
around
in
the
grass
crushing
down
the
growth
into
a
nest
in
which
she
curled
up
head
on
paws
but
travis
sat
back
on
his
heels
his
now
idle
hands
hanging
down
between
his
knees
and
forced
himself
to
the
task
of
sorting
out
jumbled
memories
this
landscape
was
wrong
totally
unlike
what
it
should
be
but
it
was
real
he
had
helped
kill
this
alien
creature
he
had
eaten
its
meat
raw
its
horn
lay
within
touch
now
all
that
was
real
and
unchangeable
which
meant
that
the
rest
of
it
that
other
desert
world
in
which
he
had
wandered
with
his
kind
ridden
horses
raided
invading
men
of
another
race
that
was
not
real
or
else
far
far
removed
from
where
he
now
sat
yet
there
had
been
no
dividing
line
between
those
two
worlds
one
moment
he
had
been
in
the
desert
place
returning
from
a
successful
foray
against
the
mexicans
mexicans
travis
caught
at
that
identification
tried
to
use
it
as
a
thread
to
draw
closer
to
the
beginning
of
his
mystery
mexicans
and
he
was
an
apache
one
of
the
eagle
people
one
who
rode
with
cochise
no
sweat
again
beaded
his
face
where
the
water
had
cooled
it
he
was
not
of
that
past
he
was
travis
fox
of
the
very
late
twentieth
century
not
a
nomad
of
the
middle
nineteenth
he
was
of
team
a
of
the
project
the
arizona
desert
and
then
this
from
one
to
the
other
in
an
instant
he
looked
about
him
in
rising
fear
wait
he
had
been
in
the
dark
when
he
got
out
of
the
desert
lying
in
a
box
getting
out
he
had
crawled
down
a
passage
to
reach
moonlight
strange
moonlight
a
box
in
which
he
had
lain
a
passage
with
smooth
metallic
walls
and
an
alien
world
at
the
end
of
it
the
coyote
ears
twitched
her
head
came
up
she
was
staring
at
the
man
drawn
face
at
his
eyes
with
their
core
of
fear
she
whined
travis
caught
up
the
two
pieces
of
horn
thrust
them
into
his
sash
belt
and
got
to
his
feet
sat
up
her
head
cocked
a
little
to
one
side
as
the
man
turned
to
seek
his
own
back
trail
she
padded
along
in
his
wake
and
whined
for
naginlta
but
travis
was
more
intent
now
on
what
he
must
prove
to
himself
than
he
was
on
the
actions
of
the
two
animals
it
was
a
wandering
trail
and
now
he
did
not
question
his
skill
in
being
able
to
follow
it
so
unerringly
the
sun
was
hot
winged
things
buzzed
from
the
bushes
small
scuttling
things
fled
from
him
through
the
tall
grass
once
naginlta
growled
a
warning
which
led
them
all
to
a
detour
and
travis
might
not
have
picked
up
the
proper
trace
again
had
not
the
coyote
scout
led
him
to
it
who
are
you
he
asked
once
and
then
guessed
it
would
have
better
been
said
what
are
you
these
were
not
animals
or
rather
they
were
more
than
the
animals
he
had
always
known
and
one
part
of
him
the
part
which
remembered
the
desert
rancherias
where
cochise
had
ruled
said
they
were
spirits
yet
that
other
part
of
him
travis
shook
his
head
accepting
them
now
for
what
they
were
welcome
company
in
an
alien
place
the
day
wore
on
close
to
sunset
and
still
travis
followed
that
wandering
trail
the
need
which
drove
him
kept
him
going
through
the
rough
country
of
hills
and
ravines
now
the
mist
lifted
above
towering
walls
of
mountains
very
near
him
yet
not
the
mountains
of
his
memory
these
were
dull
brown
with
a
forbidding
look
like
skulls
baring
teeth
in
warning
against
all
comers
with
great
difficulty
travis
topped
a
rise
ahead
against
the
skyline
stood
both
coyotes
and
as
the
man
joined
them
first
one
and
then
the
other
flung
back
its
head
and
sounded
the
sobbing
shattering
cry
which
had
been
a
part
of
that
other
life
the
apache
looked
down
his
puzzle
was
answered
in
part
the
wreckage
crumpled
on
the
mountain
side
was
identifiable
a
spaceship
cold
fear
gripped
him
and
his
own
head
went
back
from
between
his
tight
lips
came
a
cry
as
desolate
and
despairing
as
the
one
the
animals
had
voiced
fire
mankind
oldest
ally
weapon
tool
leaped
high
before
the
naked
stone
of
the
mountain
side
men
sat
about
it
fifteen
of
them
and
behind
guarded
by
the
flames
and
that
somber
circle
were
the
women
there
was
a
uniformity
in
this
gathering
the
members
were
plainly
all
of
the
same
racial
stock
of
medium
height
stocky
yet
fined
down
to
the
peak
of
stamina
and
endurance
their
skin
brown
their
hair
black
and
they
were
all
young
none
over
thirty
some
still
in
their
late
teens
alike
too
was
a
certain
drawn
look
in
their
faces
a
tenseness
of
the
eyes
and
mouth
as
they
listened
to
travis
so
we
must
be
on
topaz
do
any
of
you
remember
boarding
the
ship
no
only
that
we
awoke
within
it
across
the
fire
one
chin
lifted
the
eyes
which
caught
travis
held
a
deep
smoldering
anger
this
is
more
trickery
of
the
the
white
eyes
between
us
there
has
never
been
fair
dealing
they
have
broken
their
promise
as
a
man
breaks
a
rotten
stick
for
their
words
are
as
rotten
and
it
was
you
fox
who
brought
us
to
listen
to
them
a
stir
about
the
circle
a
murmur
from
the
women
and
do
i
not
also
sit
here
with
you
in
this
strange
wilderness
he
countered
i
do
not
understand
another
of
the
men
held
out
his
hand
palm
up
in
a
gesture
of
asking
what
has
happened
to
us
we
were
in
the
old
apache
world
i
was
riding
with
cuchillo
negro
as
we
went
down
to
the
taking
of
ramos
and
then
i
was
here
in
a
broken
ship
and
beside
me
a
dead
man
who
was
once
my
brother
how
did
i
come
out
of
the
past
of
our
people
into
another
world
across
the
stars
tricks
the
first
speaker
spat
into
the
fire
it
was
the
redax
i
think
travis
replied
i
heard
ashe
discuss
this
a
new
machine
which
could
make
a
man
remember
not
his
own
past
but
the
past
of
his
ancestors
while
we
were
on
that
ship
we
must
have
been
under
its
influence
so
we
lived
as
our
people
lived
a
hundred
years
or
more
ago
and
the
purpose
of
such
a
thing
asked
to
make
us
more
like
our
ancestors
perhaps
it
is
part
of
what
they
told
us
at
the
project
to
venture
into
these
new
worlds
requires
a
different
type
of
man
than
lives
on
terra
today
traits
we
have
forgotten
are
needed
to
face
the
dangers
of
wild
places
you
fox
have
been
beyond
the
stars
before
and
you
found
there
were
such
dangers
to
face
it
is
true
you
have
heard
of
the
three
worlds
i
saw
when
the
ship
from
the
old
days
took
us
off
unwilling
to
the
stars
did
you
not
all
volunteer
to
pioneer
in
this
manner
so
you
could
also
see
strange
and
new
things
but
we
did
not
agree
to
be
returned
to
the
past
in
medicine
dreams
and
be
sent
unknowingly
into
space
travis
nodded
deklay
is
right
but
i
know
no
more
than
you
why
we
were
so
sent
or
why
the
ship
crashed
we
have
found
ruthven
body
in
the
cabin
with
that
new
installation
only
we
have
discovered
nothing
else
which
tells
us
why
we
were
brought
here
with
the
ship
broken
we
must
stay
they
were
silent
now
men
and
women
alike
behind
them
lay
several
days
of
activity
nights
of
exhausted
slumber
against
the
cliff
wall
lay
the
packs
of
supplies
they
had
salvaged
from
the
wreck
by
mutual
consent
they
had
left
the
vicinity
of
the
broken
globe
following
their
old
custom
of
speedily
withdrawing
from
a
place
of
death
this
is
a
world
empty
of
men
wanted
to
know
so
far
we
have
found
only
animal
signs
and
the
have
not
warned
us
of
anything
else
those
devil
ones
again
deklay
spat
into
the
fire
i
say
we
should
have
no
dealings
with
them
the
is
no
friend
to
the
people
again
a
murmur
which
seemed
one
of
agreement
answered
that
outburst
travis
stiffened
just
how
much
influence
had
the
redax
had
over
them
he
knew
from
his
own
experience
that
sometimes
he
had
an
odd
double
reaction
two
different
feelings
which
almost
sickened
him
when
they
struck
simultaneously
and
he
was
beginning
to
suspect
that
with
some
of
the
others
the
return
to
the
past
had
been
far
more
deep
and
lasting
now
was
actually
to
reason
out
what
had
happened
while
deklay
had
reverted
to
an
ancestor
who
had
ridden
with
victorio
or
magnus
colorado
travis
had
a
flash
of
premonition
a
chill
which
made
him
half
foresee
a
time
when
the
past
and
the
present
might
well
split
them
apart
fatally
devil
or
a
man
with
a
quiet
face
rather
deeply
sunken
eyes
spoke
for
the
first
time
we
are
in
two
minds
because
of
this
redax
so
let
us
not
do
anything
in
haste
back
in
the
desert
world
of
the
people
i
have
seen
the
and
he
was
very
clever
with
the
badger
he
went
hunting
and
when
the
badger
had
dug
up
the
rat
nest
so
did
the
wait
on
the
other
side
of
the
thorny
bush
and
catch
those
who
would
escape
that
way
between
him
and
the
badger
there
was
no
war
these
two
who
sit
over
yonder
now
they
are
also
hunters
and
they
seem
friendly
to
us
in
a
strange
place
a
man
needs
all
the
help
he
can
find
let
us
not
call
names
out
of
old
tales
which
may
mean
nothing
in
fact
buck
speaks
straightly
agreed
we
seek
a
camp
which
can
be
defended
for
perhaps
there
are
men
here
whose
hunting
territory
we
have
invaded
though
we
have
not
yet
seen
them
we
are
a
people
small
in
number
and
alone
let
us
walk
softly
on
trails
which
are
strange
to
our
feet
inwardly
travis
sighed
in
relief
buck
for
the
moment
their
sensible
words
appeared
to
swing
the
opinions
of
the
party
if
either
of
them
could
be
established
as
or
clan
leader
they
would
all
be
safer
he
himself
had
no
aspirations
in
that
direction
and
dared
not
push
too
hard
it
had
been
his
initial
urging
which
had
brought
them
as
volunteers
into
the
project
now
he
was
doubly
suspect
and
especially
by
those
who
thought
as
deklay
he
was
considered
too
alien
to
their
old
ways
so
far
their
protests
had
been
fewer
than
he
anticipated
although
brothers
and
sisters
had
followed
each
other
into
the
team
after
the
immemorial
desire
of
apaches
to
cling
to
family
ties
they
were
not
a
true
clan
with
solidity
of
that
to
back
them
but
representatives
of
half
a
dozen
basically
back
on
terra
they
had
all
been
among
the
most
progressive
of
their
people
progressive
that
is
in
the
white
man
sense
of
the
word
travis
had
a
fleeting
recognition
of
his
now
oblique
way
of
thinking
he
too
had
been
marked
by
the
redax
they
had
all
been
educated
in
the
modern
fashion
and
all
possessed
a
spirit
of
adventure
which
marked
them
over
their
fellows
they
had
volunteered
for
the
team
and
successfully
passed
the
tests
to
weed
out
the
temperamentally
unfit
or
fainthearted
but
all
that
was
before
redax
why
had
they
been
submitted
to
that
and
why
this
flight
what
had
pushed
ashe
and
murdock
and
colonel
kelgarries
time
agents
he
knew
and
trusted
into
dispatching
them
without
warning
to
topaz
something
had
happened
something
which
had
given
ruthven
ascendancy
over
those
others
and
had
started
them
on
this
wild
trip
travis
was
conscious
of
a
stir
about
the
firelit
circle
the
men
were
rising
moving
back
into
the
shadows
stretching
out
on
the
blankets
they
had
found
among
other
stores
on
the
ship
they
had
discovered
weapons
there
knives
bows
quivers
of
arrows
all
of
which
they
had
been
trained
to
use
in
the
intensive
schooling
of
the
project
and
which
needed
no
more
repair
than
they
themselves
could
give
and
the
rations
they
carried
were
field
supplies
few
of
them
tomorrow
they
must
begin
hunting
in
earnest
why
has
this
thing
been
done
to
us
buck
was
beside
travis
those
quiet
eyes
sliding
past
him
to
seek
the
fire
once
more
i
do
not
think
you
were
told
when
the
rest
of
us
were
not
travis
seized
upon
that
there
are
those
who
say
that
i
knew
agreed
that
is
so
once
we
stood
at
the
same
place
in
time
in
our
thoughts
our
desires
now
we
stand
at
many
places
as
if
we
climbed
a
stairway
each
at
his
own
speed
a
stairway
the
has
set
us
upon
some
here
some
there
some
yet
farther
above
he
sketched
a
series
of
step
outlines
in
the
air
and
in
this
there
is
trouble
the
truth
travis
agreed
yet
it
is
also
true
that
i
knew
nothing
of
this
that
i
climb
with
you
on
these
stairs
so
i
believe
but
there
comes
a
time
when
it
is
best
not
to
be
a
woman
stirring
a
pot
of
boiling
stew
but
rather
one
who
stands
quietly
at
a
distance
you
mean
travis
pressed
i
say
that
alone
among
us
you
have
crossed
the
stars
before
therefore
new
things
are
not
so
hard
to
understand
and
we
need
a
scout
also
the
coyotes
run
in
your
footsteps
and
you
do
not
fear
them
it
made
good
sense
let
him
scout
ahead
of
the
party
taking
the
coyotes
with
him
stay
away
from
the
camp
for
a
while
and
speak
small
until
the
people
on
buck
stairway
were
more
closely
united
i
go
in
the
morning
travis
agreed
he
could
slip
away
tonight
but
just
now
he
could
not
force
himself
away
from
the
fire
from
the
companionship
you
might
take
tsoay
with
you
buck
continued
travis
waited
for
him
to
enlarge
on
that
suggestion
tsoay
was
one
of
the
youngest
of
their
group
buck
own
and
it
is
well
buck
explained
that
we
learn
this
land
and
it
has
always
been
our
custom
that
the
younger
walk
in
the
footprints
of
the
older
also
not
only
should
trails
be
learned
but
also
men
travis
caught
the
thought
behind
that
perhaps
by
taking
the
younger
men
as
scouts
one
after
another
he
could
build
up
among
them
a
following
of
sorts
among
the
apaches
leadership
was
wholly
a
matter
of
personality
until
the
reservation
days
chieftains
had
gained
their
position
by
force
of
character
alone
though
they
might
come
successively
from
one
family
clan
over
several
generations
he
did
not
want
the
chieftainship
here
no
but
neither
did
he
want
growing
whispers
working
about
him
to
cut
him
off
from
his
people
to
every
apache
severance
from
the
clan
was
a
little
death
he
must
have
those
who
would
back
him
if
deklay
or
those
who
thought
like
deklay
turned
grumbling
into
open
hostility
tsoay
is
one
quick
to
learn
travis
agreed
we
go
at
dawn
along
the
mountain
range
buck
inquired
if
we
seek
a
protected
place
for
the
rancheria
yes
the
mountains
have
always
provided
good
strongholds
for
the
people
and
you
think
there
is
need
for
a
fort
travis
shrugged
i
have
been
one
day
journey
out
into
this
world
i
saw
nothing
but
animals
but
that
is
no
promise
that
elsewhere
there
are
no
enemies
the
planet
was
on
the
tapes
we
brought
back
from
that
other
world
and
so
it
was
known
to
the
others
who
once
rode
between
star
and
star
as
we
rode
between
ranch
and
town
if
they
had
this
world
set
on
a
journey
tape
it
was
for
a
reason
that
reason
may
still
be
in
force
yet
it
was
long
ago
that
these
star
people
rode
so
buck
mused
would
the
reason
last
so
long
travis
remembered
two
other
worlds
one
of
weird
desert
inhabited
by
beast
things
or
had
they
once
been
human
human
to
the
point
of
possessing
intelligence
that
had
come
out
of
sand
burrows
at
night
to
attack
a
spaceship
and
the
second
world
where
the
ruins
of
a
giant
city
had
stood
choked
with
jungle
vegetation
where
he
had
made
a
blowgun
from
tubes
of
rustless
metal
as
a
weapon
gift
for
small
winged
men
but
were
they
men
both
had
been
remnants
of
that
ancient
galactic
empire
some
things
could
so
remain
he
answered
soberly
if
we
find
them
we
must
be
careful
but
first
a
good
site
for
the
rancheria
there
is
no
return
to
home
for
us
buck
stated
flatly
why
do
you
say
that
there
could
be
a
rescue
ship
later
the
other
raised
his
eyes
again
to
travis
when
you
slept
under
the
redax
how
did
you
ride
as
a
warrior
raiding
living
and
i
i
was
one
with
buck
returned
simply
but
but
the
white
man
has
assured
us
that
such
power
the
power
of
a
chief
does
not
exist
yes
the
has
told
us
so
many
things
he
is
busy
busy
with
his
tools
his
machines
always
busy
and
those
who
think
in
another
fashion
can
not
be
measured
by
his
rules
so
they
are
foolish
dreamers
not
all
white
men
think
so
there
was
ashe
he
was
beginning
to
understand
a
little
perhaps
i
too
am
standing
still
halfway
up
the
stairway
of
the
past
but
of
this
i
am
very
sure
for
us
there
will
be
no
return
to
our
own
place
and
the
time
will
come
when
something
new
shall
grow
from
the
seed
of
the
past
also
it
is
necessary
that
you
be
one
of
the
tenders
of
that
growth
so
i
urge
you
take
tsoay
and
the
next
time
lupe
for
the
young
who
may
be
swayed
this
way
and
that
by
words
as
the
wind
shakes
a
small
tree
must
be
given
firm
roots
in
travis
education
warred
with
instinct
just
as
the
picture
redax
had
planted
in
his
mind
had
warred
with
his
awaking
to
this
alien
landscape
yet
now
he
believed
he
must
be
guided
by
what
he
felt
and
he
knew
that
no
man
of
his
race
would
claim
the
power
of
spirit
known
only
to
a
great
chief
unless
he
had
actually
felt
it
swell
within
him
it
might
have
been
fostered
by
hallucination
in
the
past
but
the
aura
of
it
carried
into
the
here
and
now
and
travis
had
no
doubts
that
buck
believed
implicitly
in
what
he
said
and
that
belief
carried
credulity
to
others
this
is
wisdom
buck
shook
his
head
i
am
no
no
chief
but
of
some
things
i
am
sure
you
also
be
sure
of
what
lies
within
you
younger
brother
on
the
third
day
ranging
eastward
along
the
base
of
the
mountain
range
travis
found
what
he
believed
would
be
an
acceptable
camp
site
there
was
a
canyon
with
a
good
spring
of
water
cut
round
by
game
trails
a
series
of
ledges
brought
him
up
to
a
small
plateau
where
scrub
wood
could
be
used
to
build
the
wickiups
water
and
food
lay
within
reach
and
the
ledge
approach
was
easy
to
defend
even
deklay
and
his
fellow
malcontents
were
forced
to
concede
the
value
of
the
site
his
duty
to
the
clan
accomplished
travis
returned
to
his
own
concern
one
which
had
haunted
him
for
days
topaz
had
been
taped
by
men
of
the
vanished
star
empire
therefore
the
planet
was
important
but
why
as
yet
he
had
found
no
indication
that
anything
above
the
intelligence
level
of
the
split
horns
was
native
to
this
world
but
he
was
gnawed
by
the
certainty
that
there
something
here
waiting
and
the
desire
to
learn
what
it
was
became
an
ache
perhaps
he
was
what
deklay
had
accused
him
of
being
one
who
had
come
to
follow
the
road
of
the
too
closely
for
travis
was
content
to
scout
with
only
the
coyotes
for
company
and
he
did
not
find
the
loneliness
of
the
unknown
planet
as
intimidating
as
most
of
the
others
he
was
checking
his
small
trail
pack
on
the
fourth
day
after
they
had
settled
on
the
plateau
when
buck
and
hunkered
down
beside
him
you
go
to
hunt
buck
broke
the
silence
first
not
for
meat
what
do
you
fear
that
enemy
people
have
marked
this
as
their
land
questioned
that
may
be
true
but
now
i
hunt
for
what
this
world
was
at
one
time
the
reason
why
the
ancient
star
men
marked
it
as
their
own
and
this
knowledge
may
be
of
value
to
us
asked
slowly
will
it
bring
food
to
our
mouths
shelter
for
our
bodies
mean
life
for
us
all
that
is
possible
it
is
the
unknowing
which
is
bad
true
unknowing
is
always
bad
buck
agreed
but
the
bow
which
is
fitted
to
one
hand
and
strength
of
arm
may
not
be
suited
to
another
remember
that
younger
brother
also
do
you
go
alone
with
naginlta
and
i
am
not
alone
take
tsoay
with
you
also
the
ones
are
indeed
for
the
service
of
those
they
like
but
it
is
not
good
that
man
walks
alone
from
his
kind
there
it
was
again
the
feeling
of
clan
solidarity
which
travis
did
not
always
share
on
the
other
hand
tsoay
would
not
be
a
hindrance
on
other
scouts
the
boy
had
proved
to
have
a
keen
eye
for
the
country
and
a
liking
for
experimentation
which
was
not
a
universal
attribute
even
among
those
of
his
own
age
i
would
go
to
find
a
path
through
the
mountains
it
may
be
a
long
trail
travis
half
protested
you
believe
what
you
seek
may
lie
to
the
north
travis
shrugged
i
do
not
know
how
can
i
but
it
will
be
another
way
of
seeking
tsoay
shall
go
he
keeps
silent
before
older
warriors
as
is
proper
for
the
untried
but
his
thoughts
fly
free
as
do
yours
buck
replied
it
is
in
him
also
this
need
to
see
new
places
there
is
this
got
to
his
feet
do
not
go
so
far
brother
that
you
may
not
easily
find
a
way
to
return
this
is
a
wide
land
and
within
it
we
are
but
a
handful
of
men
alone
that
too
i
know
travis
thought
he
could
read
more
than
one
kind
of
warning
in
words
they
were
the
second
day
away
from
the
plateau
camp
and
climbing
when
they
chanced
upon
the
pass
travis
had
hoped
might
exist
before
them
lay
an
abrupt
descent
to
what
appeared
to
be
open
plains
country
cloaked
in
a
dusky
amber
travis
now
knew
was
the
thick
grass
found
in
the
southern
valleys
tsoay
pointed
with
his
chin
wide
land
good
for
horses
cattle
ranches
but
all
those
lay
far
beyond
the
black
space
surrounding
them
travis
wondered
if
there
was
any
native
animal
which
could
serve
man
in
place
of
the
horse
do
we
go
down
tsoay
asked
from
this
point
travis
could
sight
no
break
far
out
on
the
amber
plain
no
sign
of
any
building
or
any
disturbance
of
its
smooth
emptiness
yet
it
drew
him
we
go
he
decided
close
as
it
had
looked
from
the
pass
the
plain
was
yet
a
day
and
a
night
spent
in
careful
watching
by
turns
ahead
of
them
it
was
midmorning
of
the
second
day
that
they
left
the
foothill
breaks
and
the
grass
of
the
open
country
was
waist
high
about
them
travis
could
see
it
rippling
where
the
coyotes
threaded
ahead
then
he
was
conscious
of
a
persistent
buzzing
a
noise
which
irritated
faintly
until
he
was
compelled
to
trace
it
to
its
source
the
grass
had
been
trampled
flat
for
an
irregular
patch
with
a
trail
of
broken
stalks
out
of
the
heart
of
the
plain
at
one
side
was
a
buzzing
seething
mass
of
insects
which
travis
already
knew
as
carrion
eaters
they
arose
reluctantly
from
their
feast
as
he
approached
he
drew
a
short
breath
which
was
close
to
a
grunt
of
astounded
recognition
what
lay
there
was
so
impossible
that
he
could
not
believe
the
evidence
of
his
eyes
tsoay
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
went
down
on
one
knee
for
a
closer
examination
then
looked
at
travis
over
his
shoulder
his
eyes
wide
more
than
a
trace
of
excitement
in
his
voice
horse
dung
and
fresh
there
was
one
horse
unshod
but
ridden
it
came
here
from
the
plains
and
it
had
been
ridden
hard
going
lame
there
was
a
rest
here
maybe
shortly
after
dawn
travis
sorted
out
what
they
had
learned
by
a
careful
examination
of
the
ground
and
naginlta
tsoay
watched
and
listened
as
if
the
coyotes
as
well
as
the
boy
could
understand
every
word
there
is
that
also
tsoay
indicated
the
one
trace
left
by
the
unknown
rider
an
impression
blurred
as
if
some
attempt
had
been
made
to
conceal
it
small
and
light
the
rider
is
both
also
in
fear
i
think
we
follow
tsoay
asked
we
follow
travis
assented
he
looked
to
the
coyotes
and
as
he
had
learned
to
do
thought
out
his
message
this
trail
was
the
one
to
be
followed
when
the
rider
was
sighted
they
were
to
report
back
if
the
apaches
had
not
yet
caught
up
there
was
no
visible
agreement
the
coyotes
simply
vanished
through
the
wall
of
grass
then
there
are
others
here
tsoay
said
as
he
and
travis
began
their
return
to
the
foothills
perhaps
there
was
a
second
ship
that
horse
travis
said
shaking
his
head
there
was
no
provision
in
the
project
for
the
shipping
of
horses
perhaps
they
have
always
been
here
not
so
to
each
world
its
own
species
of
beasts
but
we
shall
know
the
truth
when
we
look
upon
that
horse
and
its
rider
it
was
warmer
this
side
of
the
mountains
and
the
heat
of
the
plains
beat
at
them
travis
thought
that
the
horse
might
well
be
seeking
water
if
allowed
his
head
where
did
he
come
from
and
why
had
his
rider
gone
in
haste
and
fear
this
was
rough
broken
country
and
the
tired
limping
horse
seemed
to
have
picked
the
easiest
way
through
it
without
any
hindrance
from
the
man
with
him
travis
spotted
a
soft
patch
of
ground
with
a
impression
this
time
there
had
been
no
attempt
at
erasure
the
boot
track
was
plain
the
rider
had
dismounted
and
was
leading
the
horse
yet
he
was
moving
swiftly
they
followed
the
tracks
around
the
bend
of
a
shallow
cut
and
found
waiting
for
them
between
her
forefeet
was
a
bundle
still
covered
with
smears
of
soft
earth
and
behind
her
were
drag
marks
from
a
hole
under
the
overhang
of
a
bush
the
coyote
had
plainly
just
disinterred
her
find
travis
squatted
down
to
examine
it
using
his
eyes
before
his
hands
it
was
a
bag
made
of
hide
probably
the
hide
of
one
of
the
split
horns
by
its
color
and
the
scraps
of
long
hair
which
had
been
left
in
a
simple
decorative
fringe
along
the
bottom
the
sides
had
been
laced
together
neatly
by
someone
used
to
working
in
leather
the
closing
flap
lashed
down
tightly
with
braided
thong
loops
as
the
apache
leaned
closer
to
it
he
could
smell
a
mixture
of
odors
the
hide
itself
horse
wood
smoke
and
other
scents
strange
to
him
he
undid
the
fastenings
and
pulled
out
the
contents
there
was
a
shirt
with
long
full
sleeves
of
a
gray
wool
undyed
from
the
sheep
then
a
very
bulky
short
jacket
which
after
fingering
it
doubtfully
travis
decided
was
made
of
felt
it
was
elaborately
decorated
with
highly
colorful
embroidery
and
there
was
no
mistaking
the
design
a
heavy
antlered
terran
deer
in
mortal
combat
with
what
might
be
a
puma
it
was
bordered
with
a
geometric
pattern
of
beautiful
oddly
familiar
work
travis
smoothed
it
flat
over
his
knee
and
tried
to
remember
where
he
had
seen
its
like
before
a
book
an
illustration
in
a
book
but
which
book
when
not
recently
and
it
was
not
a
pattern
known
to
his
own
people
twisted
into
the
interior
of
the
jacket
was
a
silklike
scarf
clear
light
blue
the
blue
of
terra
cloudless
skies
on
certain
days
so
different
from
the
yellow
shield
now
hanging
above
them
a
small
case
of
leather
with
silhouetted
designs
cut
from
hide
and
affixed
to
it
designs
as
intricate
and
complex
as
the
embroidery
on
the
jacket
art
of
a
high
standard
in
the
case
a
knife
and
spoon
the
bowl
and
blade
of
dull
metal
the
handles
of
horn
carved
with
horse
heads
the
tiny
eyes
set
with
glittering
stones
personal
possessions
dear
to
the
owner
so
that
when
they
must
be
abandoned
for
flight
they
were
hidden
with
some
hope
of
recovery
travis
slowly
repacked
them
trying
to
fold
the
garments
into
their
original
creases
he
was
still
puzzled
by
those
designs
who
tsoay
touched
the
edge
of
the
jacket
with
one
finger
his
admiration
for
it
plain
to
read
i
do
know
but
it
is
of
our
own
world
that
is
a
deer
though
the
horns
are
wrong
tsoay
agreed
and
the
puma
is
very
well
done
the
one
who
made
this
knows
animals
well
travis
pushed
the
jacket
back
into
the
bag
and
laced
it
shut
but
he
did
not
return
it
to
the
hiding
place
instead
he
made
it
a
part
of
his
own
pack
if
they
did
not
succeed
in
running
down
the
fugitive
he
wanted
an
opportunity
for
closer
study
a
chance
to
remember
just
where
he
had
seen
that
picture
before
the
narrow
valley
where
they
had
discovered
the
bag
sloped
upward
and
there
were
signs
that
their
quarry
found
the
ground
harder
to
cover
the
second
discard
lay
in
open
sight
again
a
leather
bag
which
sniffed
and
then
began
to
lick
eagerly
thrusting
her
nose
into
its
flaccid
interior
travis
picked
it
up
finding
it
damp
to
the
touch
it
had
an
odd
smell
like
that
of
sour
milk
he
ran
a
finger
around
inside
brought
it
out
wet
yet
this
was
neither
water
bag
nor
canteen
and
he
was
completely
mystified
when
he
turned
it
inside
out
for
though
the
inner
surface
was
wet
the
bag
was
empty
he
offered
it
to
the
coyote
and
she
took
it
promptly
holding
it
firmly
to
the
earth
with
her
forepaws
she
licked
the
surface
though
travis
could
see
no
deposit
which
might
attract
her
it
was
clear
that
the
bag
had
once
held
some
sort
of
food
here
they
rested
tsoay
said
not
too
far
ahead
now
but
now
they
were
in
the
kind
of
country
where
a
man
could
hide
in
order
to
check
on
his
back
trail
travis
studied
the
terrain
and
then
made
his
own
plans
they
would
leave
the
plainly
marked
trace
of
the
fugitive
strike
out
upslope
to
the
east
and
try
to
parallel
the
other
route
in
that
maze
of
rock
outcrops
and
wood
copses
there
was
tricky
going
gave
a
last
lick
to
the
bag
as
travis
signaled
her
she
regarded
him
then
turned
her
head
to
survey
the
country
before
them
at
last
she
trotted
on
her
buff
coat
melting
into
the
vegetation
with
naginlta
she
would
scout
the
quarry
and
keep
watch
leaving
the
men
to
take
the
longer
way
around
travis
pulled
off
his
shirt
folding
it
into
a
packet
and
tucking
it
beneath
the
folds
of
his
just
as
his
ancestors
had
always
done
before
a
fight
then
he
cached
his
pack
and
tsoay
as
they
began
the
stiff
climb
they
carried
only
their
bows
the
quivers
slung
on
their
shoulders
and
the
knives
but
they
flitted
like
shadows
and
like
the
coyotes
their
bodies
became
indistinguishable
against
the
bronze
of
the
land
they
should
be
travis
judged
not
more
than
an
hour
away
from
sundown
and
they
had
to
locate
the
stranger
before
the
dark
closed
in
his
respect
for
their
quarry
had
grown
the
unknown
might
have
been
driven
by
fear
but
he
held
to
a
good
pace
and
headed
intelligently
for
just
the
kind
of
country
which
would
serve
him
best
if
travis
could
only
remember
where
he
had
seen
the
like
of
that
embroidery
it
had
a
meaning
which
might
be
important
now
tsoay
slipped
behind
a
tree
and
disappeared
travis
stooped
under
a
line
of
bush
limbs
both
were
working
their
way
south
using
the
peak
ahead
as
an
agreed
landmark
pausing
at
intervals
to
examine
the
landscape
for
any
hint
of
a
man
and
horse
travis
squirmed
snake
fashion
into
an
opening
between
two
rock
pillars
and
lay
there
the
westering
sun
hot
on
his
bare
shoulders
and
back
his
chin
propped
on
his
forearm
in
the
band
holding
back
his
hair
he
had
inserted
some
concealing
tufts
of
wiry
mountain
grass
the
ends
of
which
drooped
over
his
rugged
features
only
seconds
earlier
he
had
caught
that
fragmentary
warning
from
one
of
the
coyotes
what
they
sought
was
very
close
it
was
right
down
there
both
animals
were
in
ambush
awaiting
orders
and
what
they
found
was
familiar
another
confirmation
that
the
fugitive
was
terran
not
native
to
topaz
with
searching
eyes
travis
examined
the
site
indicated
by
the
coyotes
his
respect
for
the
stranger
was
raised
another
notch
in
time
either
he
or
tsoay
might
have
sighted
that
hideaway
without
the
aid
of
the
animal
scouts
on
the
other
hand
they
might
have
failed
for
the
fugitive
had
truly
gone
to
earth
using
some
pocket
or
crevice
in
the
mountain
wall
there
was
no
sign
of
the
horse
but
a
branch
here
and
there
had
been
pulled
out
of
place
the
scars
of
their
removal
readable
when
one
knew
where
to
look
odd
travis
began
to
puzzle
over
what
he
saw
it
was
almost
as
if
whatever
pursuit
the
stranger
feared
would
come
not
at
ground
level
but
from
above
the
precautions
the
stranger
had
taken
were
to
veil
his
retreat
to
the
reaches
of
the
mountain
side
had
he
expected
any
trailer
to
make
a
flanking
move
from
up
that
slope
where
the
apaches
now
lay
travis
teeth
nipped
the
weathered
skin
of
his
forearm
could
it
be
that
at
some
time
during
the
day
journeying
the
fugitive
had
doubled
back
having
seen
his
trackers
but
there
had
been
no
traces
of
any
such
scouting
and
the
coyotes
would
surely
have
warned
them
human
eyes
and
ears
could
be
tricked
but
travis
trusted
the
senses
of
naginlta
and
far
above
his
own
no
he
did
not
believe
that
the
rider
expected
the
apaches
but
the
man
did
expect
someone
or
something
which
would
come
upon
him
from
the
heights
the
heights
travis
rolled
his
head
slightly
to
look
at
the
upper
reaches
of
the
hills
about
him
with
suspicion
in
their
own
journey
across
the
mountains
and
through
the
pass
they
had
found
nothing
threatening
dangerous
animals
might
roam
there
there
had
been
some
paw
marks
one
such
trail
the
coyotes
had
warned
against
but
the
type
of
precautions
the
stranger
had
taken
were
against
intelligent
thinking
beings
not
against
animals
more
likely
to
track
by
scent
than
by
sight
and
if
the
stranger
expected
an
attack
from
above
then
travis
and
tsoay
must
be
alert
travis
analyzed
each
feature
of
the
hillside
setting
in
his
mind
a
picture
of
every
inch
of
ground
they
must
cross
just
as
he
had
wanted
daylight
as
an
ally
before
so
now
was
he
willing
to
wait
for
the
shadows
of
twilight
he
closed
his
eyes
in
a
final
check
able
to
recall
the
details
of
the
hiding
place
knowing
that
he
could
reach
it
when
the
conditions
favored
without
mistake
then
he
edged
back
from
his
vantage
point
and
raising
his
fingers
to
his
lips
made
a
small
angry
chittering
three
times
repeated
one
of
the
species
inhabiting
these
heights
as
they
had
noted
earlier
was
a
creature
about
as
big
as
the
palm
of
a
man
hand
resembling
nothing
so
much
as
a
round
ball
of
ruffled
feathers
though
its
covering
might
actually
have
been
a
silky
fluffy
fur
its
short
legs
could
cover
ground
at
an
amazing
speed
and
it
had
the
bold
impudence
of
a
creature
with
few
natural
enemies
this
was
its
usual
cry
tsoay
hand
waved
travis
on
to
where
the
younger
man
had
taken
position
behind
the
bleached
trunk
of
a
fallen
tree
he
hides
tsoay
whispered
against
trouble
from
above
travis
added
his
own
observation
but
not
us
i
think
so
tsoay
had
come
to
that
conclusion
too
travis
tried
to
gauge
the
nearness
of
twilight
there
was
a
period
after
the
passing
of
topaz
sun
when
the
dusky
light
played
odd
tricks
with
shadows
that
would
be
the
first
time
for
their
move
he
said
as
much
and
tsoay
nodded
eagerly
they
sat
with
their
backs
to
a
boulder
the
tree
trunk
serving
as
a
screen
and
chewed
methodically
on
ration
tablets
there
was
energy
and
sustenance
in
the
tasteless
squares
which
would
support
men
even
though
their
stomachs
continued
to
demand
the
satisfaction
of
fresh
meat
taking
turns
they
dozed
a
little
but
the
last
banners
of
topaz
sun
were
still
in
the
sky
when
travis
judged
the
shadows
cover
enough
he
had
no
way
of
knowing
how
the
stranger
was
armed
though
he
used
a
horse
for
transportation
he
might
well
carry
a
rifle
and
the
most
modern
terran
sidearms
the
apaches
bows
were
little
use
for
infighting
but
they
had
their
knives
however
travis
wanted
to
take
the
fugitive
unharmed
if
he
could
there
was
information
he
must
have
so
he
did
not
even
draw
his
knife
as
he
started
downhill
when
he
reached
a
pool
of
violet
dusk
at
the
bottom
of
the
small
ravine
naginlta
eyes
regarded
him
knowingly
travis
signaled
with
his
hand
and
thought
out
what
would
be
the
coyotes
part
in
this
surprise
attack
the
silhouette
vanished
uphill
the
chitter
of
a
sounded
twice
tsoay
was
in
position
a
howl
wailing
sobbing
was
heard
one
of
the
keening
songs
of
the
travis
darted
forward
he
heard
the
nicker
of
a
frightened
horse
a
clicking
which
could
have
marked
the
pawing
of
hoof
on
gravel
saw
the
brush
hiding
the
stranger
hole
tremble
a
portion
of
it
fall
away
travis
sped
on
his
moccasins
making
no
sound
on
the
ground
one
of
the
coyotes
gave
tongue
for
the
second
time
the
eerie
wailing
rising
to
a
yapping
which
echoed
from
the
rocks
about
them
travis
poised
for
a
dive
another
section
of
those
artfully
heaped
branches
had
given
way
and
a
horse
reared
its
upflung
head
plainly
marked
against
the
sky
a
blurred
figure
weaved
back
and
forth
before
it
trying
to
control
the
mount
the
stranger
had
his
hands
full
certainly
no
weapon
drawn
this
was
it
travis
leaped
his
hands
found
their
mark
the
shoulders
of
the
stranger
there
was
a
shrill
cry
from
the
other
as
he
tried
to
turn
in
the
apache
hold
to
face
his
attacker
but
travis
bore
them
both
on
rolling
almost
under
the
feet
of
the
horse
sliding
downhill
the
unknown
writhing
body
pinned
down
by
the
apache
weight
and
his
clasp
tight
as
an
iron
grip
about
the
other
chest
and
upper
arms
he
felt
his
opponent
go
limp
but
was
suspicious
enough
not
to
release
that
hold
for
the
heavy
breathing
of
the
stranger
was
not
that
of
an
unconscious
man
they
lay
so
the
unknown
still
tight
in
travis
hold
but
no
longer
fighting
the
apache
could
hear
tsoay
soothing
the
horse
with
the
purring
words
of
a
practiced
horseman
still
the
stranger
did
not
resume
the
struggle
they
could
not
lie
in
this
position
all
night
travis
thought
with
a
wry
twist
of
amusement
he
shifted
his
hold
and
got
the
response
he
had
expected
but
it
was
not
quite
quick
enough
for
travis
had
the
hands
behind
his
back
cupping
slender
almost
delicate
wrists
together
throw
me
a
cord
he
called
to
tsoay
the
younger
man
ran
up
with
an
extra
bow
cord
and
in
a
moment
they
had
bonds
on
the
struggling
captive
travis
rolled
their
catch
over
reaching
down
for
a
fistful
of
hair
to
pull
the
head
into
a
patch
of
clearer
light
in
his
grasp
that
hair
came
loose
a
braid
unwinding
he
grunted
as
he
looked
down
into
the
stranger
face
dust
marks
were
streaked
now
with
tear
runnels
but
the
gray
eyes
which
turned
fiercely
on
him
said
that
their
owner
cried
more
in
rage
than
fear
his
captive
might
be
wearing
long
trousers
tucked
into
curved
toed
boots
and
a
loose
overblouse
but
she
was
certainly
not
only
a
woman
but
a
very
young
and
attractive
one
also
at
the
present
moment
an
exceedingly
angry
one
and
behind
that
anger
was
fear
the
fear
of
one
fighting
hopelessly
against
insurmountable
odds
but
as
she
eyed
travis
now
her
expression
changed
he
felt
she
had
expected
another
captor
altogether
and
was
astounded
at
the
sight
of
him
her
tongue
touched
her
lips
moistening
them
and
now
the
fear
in
her
was
another
kind
the
wary
fear
of
one
facing
a
totally
new
and
perhaps
dangerous
thing
who
are
you
travis
spoke
in
english
for
he
had
no
doubts
that
she
was
terran
now
she
sucked
in
her
breath
with
a
gasp
of
pure
astonishment
who
are
she
parroted
his
question
in
a
marked
accent
english
was
not
her
native
tongue
he
was
sure
travis
reached
out
and
again
his
hands
closed
on
her
shoulders
she
started
to
twist
and
then
realized
he
was
merely
pulling
her
up
to
a
sitting
position
some
of
the
fear
had
left
her
eyes
an
intent
interest
taking
its
place
you
are
not
sons
of
the
blue
wolf
she
stated
in
her
heavily
accented
speech
travis
smiled
i
am
the
fox
not
the
wolf
he
returned
and
the
coyote
is
my
brother
he
snapped
his
fingers
at
the
shadows
and
the
two
animals
came
noiselessly
into
sight
her
gaze
widened
even
more
at
naginlta
and
and
she
deduced
the
bond
which
must
exist
between
her
captor
and
the
beasts
this
woman
is
also
of
our
world
tsoay
spoke
in
apache
looking
over
their
prisoner
with
frank
interest
only
she
is
not
of
the
people
sons
of
the
blue
wolf
travis
thought
again
of
the
embroidery
designs
on
the
jacket
who
had
called
themselves
by
that
picturesque
title
where
and
when
in
time
what
do
you
fear
daughter
of
the
blue
wolf
he
asked
and
with
that
question
he
seemed
to
touch
some
button
activating
terror
she
flung
back
her
head
so
that
she
could
see
the
darkening
sky
the
flyer
her
voice
was
muted
as
if
more
than
a
whisper
would
carry
to
the
stars
just
coming
into
brilliance
above
them
they
will
come
tracking
i
did
not
reach
the
inner
mountains
in
time
there
was
a
despairing
note
in
that
which
cut
through
to
travis
who
found
that
he
too
was
searching
the
sky
not
knowing
what
he
looked
for
or
what
kind
of
menace
it
promised
only
that
it
was
real
danger
the
night
comes
tsoay
spoke
slowly
in
english
do
these
you
fear
hunt
in
the
dark
she
shook
her
head
to
free
her
forehead
from
a
coil
of
braid
pulled
loose
in
her
struggle
with
travis
they
do
not
need
eyes
or
such
noses
as
those
hunters
of
yours
they
have
a
machine
to
track
then
what
purpose
is
this
brush
pile
of
yours
travis
raised
his
chin
at
the
disturbed
hiding
place
they
do
not
constantly
use
the
machine
and
one
can
hope
but
at
night
they
can
ride
on
its
beam
we
are
not
far
enough
into
the
hills
to
lose
them
bahatur
went
lame
and
so
i
was
slowed
and
what
lies
in
these
mountains
that
those
you
fear
dare
not
invade
them
travis
continued
i
do
not
know
save
if
one
can
climb
far
enough
inside
one
is
safe
from
pursuit
i
ask
it
again
who
are
you
the
apache
leaned
forward
his
face
in
the
light
now
only
inches
away
from
hers
she
did
not
shrink
from
his
close
scrutiny
but
met
him
eye
to
eye
this
was
a
woman
of
proud
independence
truly
a
chief
daughter
travis
decided
i
am
of
the
people
of
the
blue
wolf
we
were
brought
across
the
star
lanes
to
make
this
world
safe
for
for
the
she
hesitated
and
now
there
was
a
shade
of
puzzlement
on
her
face
there
is
a
reason
a
dream
no
there
is
the
dream
and
there
is
reality
i
am
kaydessa
of
the
golden
horde
but
sometimes
i
remember
other
things
like
this
speech
of
strange
words
i
am
mouthing
now
the
golden
horde
travis
knew
now
the
embroidery
sons
of
the
blue
wolf
all
fitted
into
a
special
pattern
but
what
a
pattern
scythian
art
the
ornament
that
the
warriors
of
genghis
khan
bore
so
proudly
tatars
mongols
the
barbarians
who
had
swept
from
the
fastness
of
the
steppes
to
change
the
course
of
history
not
only
in
asia
but
across
the
plains
of
middle
europe
the
men
of
the
emperor
khans
who
had
ridden
behind
the
standards
of
genghis
khan
kublai
khan
tamerlane
the
golden
horde
travis
repeated
once
again
that
lies
far
back
in
the
history
of
another
world
wolf
daughter
she
stared
at
him
a
queer
lost
expression
on
her
face
i
know
her
voice
was
so
muted
he
could
hardly
distinguish
the
words
my
people
live
in
two
times
and
many
do
not
realize
that
tsoay
had
crouched
down
beside
them
to
listen
now
he
put
out
his
hand
touching
travis
shoulder
redax
or
its
like
for
travis
was
sure
of
one
point
the
project
which
had
been
training
three
teams
for
space
colonization
one
of
eskimos
one
of
pacific
islanders
and
one
of
his
own
apaches
had
no
reason
or
chance
to
select
mongols
from
the
wild
past
of
the
raiding
hordes
there
was
only
one
nation
on
terra
which
could
have
picked
such
colonists
you
are
russian
he
studied
her
carefully
intent
on
noting
the
effect
of
his
words
but
she
did
not
lose
that
lost
look
russian
russian
she
repeated
as
if
the
very
word
was
strange
travis
was
alarmed
any
russian
colony
planted
here
could
well
possess
technicians
with
machines
capable
of
tracking
a
fugitive
and
if
mountain
heights
were
protection
against
such
a
hunt
he
intended
to
gain
them
even
by
night
traveling
he
said
this
to
tsoay
and
the
other
emphatically
agreed
the
horse
is
too
lame
to
go
on
the
younger
man
reported
travis
hesitated
for
a
long
second
since
the
time
they
had
stolen
their
first
mounts
from
the
encroaching
spanish
horses
had
always
been
wealth
to
his
people
to
leave
an
animal
which
could
well
serve
the
clan
was
not
right
but
they
dared
not
waste
time
with
a
lame
beast
leave
it
here
free
he
ordered
and
the
woman
she
goes
with
us
we
must
learn
all
we
can
of
these
people
and
what
they
do
here
listen
wolf
daughter
again
travis
leaned
close
to
make
sure
she
was
listening
to
him
as
he
spoke
with
emphasis
you
will
travel
with
us
into
these
high
places
and
there
will
be
no
trouble
from
you
he
drew
his
knife
and
held
the
blade
warningly
before
her
eyes
it
was
already
in
my
mind
to
go
to
the
mountains
she
told
him
evenly
untie
my
hands
brave
warrior
you
have
surely
nothing
to
fear
from
a
woman
his
hand
made
a
swift
sweep
and
plucked
a
knife
as
long
and
keen
as
his
from
the
folds
of
the
sash
beneath
her
loose
outer
garment
not
now
wolf
daughter
since
i
have
drawn
your
fangs
he
helped
her
to
her
feet
and
slashed
the
cord
about
her
wrists
with
her
knife
which
he
then
fastened
to
his
own
belt
alerting
the
coyotes
he
dispatched
them
ahead
and
the
three
started
on
the
mongol
girl
between
the
two
apaches
the
abandoned
horse
nickered
lonesomely
and
then
began
to
graze
on
tufts
of
grass
moving
slowly
to
favor
his
foot
the
two
moons
rode
the
sky
as
the
hours
advanced
their
beams
fighting
the
shadows
travis
felt
reasonably
safe
from
any
attack
at
ground
level
depending
upon
the
coyotes
for
warning
but
he
held
them
all
to
a
steady
pace
and
he
did
not
question
the
girl
again
until
all
three
of
them
hunkered
down
at
a
small
mountain
spring
to
dash
icy
water
over
their
faces
and
drink
from
cupped
hands
why
do
you
flee
your
own
people
wolf
daughter
my
name
is
kaydessa
she
corrected
him
he
chuckled
with
laughter
at
the
prim
tone
of
her
voice
and
you
see
here
tsoay
of
the
people
the
apaches
while
i
am
fox
he
was
giving
her
the
english
equivalent
of
his
tribal
name
apaches
she
tried
to
repeat
the
word
with
the
same
accent
he
had
used
and
what
are
apaches
indians
amerindians
he
explained
but
you
have
not
answered
my
question
kaydessa
why
do
you
run
from
your
own
people
not
from
my
people
she
said
shaking
her
head
determinedly
from
those
others
it
is
like
this
oh
how
can
i
make
you
understand
rightly
she
spread
her
wet
hands
out
before
her
in
the
moonlight
the
damp
patches
on
her
sleeves
clinging
to
her
arms
there
are
my
people
of
the
golden
horde
though
once
we
were
different
and
we
can
remember
bits
of
that
previous
life
then
there
are
also
the
men
who
live
in
the
sky
ship
and
use
the
machine
so
that
we
think
only
the
thoughts
they
would
have
us
think
now
why
she
looked
at
travis
intently
do
i
wish
to
tell
you
all
this
it
is
strange
you
say
you
are
indian
american
are
we
then
enemies
there
is
a
part
memory
which
says
that
we
are
were
let
us
rather
say
he
corrected
her
that
the
apaches
and
the
horde
are
not
enemies
here
and
now
no
matter
what
was
before
that
was
the
truth
travis
recognized
by
all
accounts
his
people
had
come
out
of
asia
in
the
very
dim
beginnings
of
migrating
peoples
for
all
her
hair
and
gray
eyes
this
girl
who
had
been
arbitrarily
returned
to
a
past
just
as
they
had
been
by
redax
could
well
be
a
distant
you
kaydessa
fingers
rested
for
a
moment
on
his
wrist
you
too
were
sent
here
from
across
the
stars
is
this
not
so
it
is
so
and
there
are
those
here
who
govern
you
now
no
we
are
free
how
did
you
become
free
she
demanded
fiercely
travis
hesitated
he
did
not
want
to
tell
of
the
wrecked
ship
the
fact
that
his
people
possessed
no
real
defenses
against
the
colony
we
went
to
the
mountains
he
replied
evasively
your
governing
machine
failed
kaydessa
laughed
ah
they
are
so
great
those
men
of
the
machines
but
they
are
smaller
and
weaker
when
their
machines
can
not
obey
them
it
is
so
with
your
camp
travis
probed
gently
he
was
not
quite
sure
of
her
meaning
but
he
dared
not
ask
more
detailed
questions
without
dangerously
revealing
his
own
ignorance
in
some
manner
their
control
machine
it
can
only
work
upon
those
within
a
certain
distance
they
discovered
that
in
the
days
of
the
first
landing
when
hunters
went
out
freely
and
many
of
them
did
not
return
after
that
when
hunters
were
sent
out
to
learn
how
lay
this
land
they
went
along
in
the
flyer
with
a
machine
so
that
there
would
be
no
more
escapes
but
we
knew
kaydessa
fingers
curled
into
small
fists
yes
we
knew
that
if
we
could
get
beyond
the
machines
there
was
freedom
for
us
and
we
planned
many
of
us
planned
then
nine
or
ten
sleeps
ago
those
others
were
very
excited
they
gathered
in
their
ship
watching
their
machines
and
something
happened
for
a
while
all
those
machines
went
dead
jagatai
kuchar
my
brother
hulagur
menlik
she
was
counting
the
names
off
on
her
fingers
they
raided
the
horse
herd
rode
out
and
you
i
too
should
have
ridden
but
there
was
aljar
my
sister
wife
she
was
very
near
her
time
and
to
ride
thus
fleeing
and
fast
might
kill
her
and
the
child
so
i
did
not
go
her
son
was
born
that
night
but
the
others
had
the
machine
at
work
once
more
we
might
long
to
go
here
she
brought
her
fist
up
to
her
breast
and
then
raised
it
to
her
head
but
there
was
that
which
kept
us
to
the
camp
and
their
will
we
only
knew
that
if
we
could
reach
the
mountains
we
might
find
our
people
who
had
already
gained
their
freedom
but
you
are
here
how
did
you
escape
tsoay
wanted
to
know
they
knew
that
i
would
have
gone
had
it
not
been
for
aljar
so
they
said
they
would
make
her
ride
out
with
them
unless
i
played
guide
to
lead
them
to
my
brother
and
the
others
then
i
knew
i
must
take
up
the
sword
of
duty
and
hunt
with
them
but
i
prayed
that
the
spirits
of
the
upper
air
look
with
favor
upon
me
and
they
granted
aid
her
eyes
held
a
look
of
wonder
for
when
we
were
out
on
the
plains
and
well
away
from
the
settlement
a
grass
devil
attacked
the
leader
of
the
searching
party
and
he
dropped
the
mind
control
and
so
it
was
broken
then
i
rode
blue
sky
above
knows
how
i
rode
and
those
others
are
not
with
their
horses
as
are
the
people
of
the
wolf
when
did
this
happen
three
suns
ago
travis
counted
back
in
his
mind
her
date
for
the
failure
of
the
machine
in
the
russian
camp
seemed
to
coincide
with
the
crash
landing
of
the
american
ship
had
one
thing
any
connection
with
the
other
it
was
very
possible
the
planeting
spacer
might
have
fought
some
kind
of
weird
duel
with
the
other
colony
before
it
plunged
to
earth
on
the
other
side
of
the
mountain
range
do
you
know
where
in
these
mountains
your
people
hide
kaydessa
shook
her
head
only
that
i
must
head
south
and
when
i
reach
the
highest
peak
make
a
signal
fire
on
the
north
slope
but
that
i
can
not
do
now
for
those
in
the
flyer
may
see
it
i
know
they
are
on
my
trail
for
twice
i
have
seen
it
listen
fox
i
ask
this
of
you
i
kaydessa
who
am
eldest
daughter
to
the
khan
for
you
are
like
unto
us
a
warrior
and
a
brave
man
that
i
believe
it
may
be
that
you
can
not
be
governed
by
their
machine
for
you
have
not
rested
under
their
spell
nor
are
of
our
blood
therefore
if
they
come
close
enough
to
send
forth
the
call
the
call
i
must
obey
as
if
i
were
a
slave
dragged
upon
a
horse
rope
then
do
you
bind
my
hands
and
feet
and
hold
me
here
no
matter
how
much
i
struggle
to
follow
that
command
for
that
which
is
truly
me
does
not
want
to
go
will
you
swear
this
by
the
fires
which
expel
demons
the
utter
sincerity
of
her
tone
convinced
travis
that
she
was
pleading
for
aid
against
a
danger
she
firmly
believed
in
whether
she
was
right
about
his
immunity
to
the
russian
mental
control
was
another
matter
and
one
he
would
rather
not
put
to
the
test
we
do
not
swear
by
your
fires
blue
wolf
maiden
but
by
the
path
of
the
lightning
his
fingers
moved
as
if
to
curl
about
the
sacred
charred
wood
his
people
had
once
carried
as
medicine
so
do
i
promise
she
looked
at
him
for
a
long
moment
and
then
nodded
in
satisfaction
they
left
the
pool
and
pushed
on
toward
the
mountain
slopes
working
their
way
back
to
the
pass
a
low
growl
out
of
the
dark
brought
them
to
an
instant
halt
naginlta
warning
was
sharp
there
was
danger
ahead
acute
danger
the
moonlight
from
the
moons
made
a
weird
pattern
of
light
and
dark
on
the
stretch
ahead
anything
from
a
slinking
hunter
to
a
war
party
of
intelligent
beings
might
have
been
lying
in
wait
there
a
flitting
shadow
out
of
shadows
pressed
against
legs
making
a
barrier
of
her
warm
body
attracting
his
attention
to
a
spot
at
the
left
perhaps
a
hundred
yards
on
there
was
a
great
splotch
of
dark
there
large
enough
to
hide
a
really
formidable
opponent
that
wordless
communication
between
animal
and
man
told
travis
that
such
an
opponent
was
just
what
was
lurking
there
whatever
lay
in
ambush
beside
the
upper
track
was
growing
impatient
as
its
destined
prey
ceased
to
advance
the
coyotes
reported
your
left
beyond
that
pointed
rock
in
the
big
shadow
do
you
see
it
tsoay
demanded
no
but
the
do
the
men
had
their
bows
ready
arrows
set
to
the
cords
but
in
this
light
such
weapons
were
practically
useless
unless
the
enemy
moved
into
the
path
of
the
moon
what
is
it
kaydessa
asked
in
a
half
whisper
something
waits
for
us
ahead
before
he
could
stop
her
she
set
her
fingers
to
her
lips
and
gave
a
piercing
whistle
there
was
answering
movement
in
the
shadow
travis
shot
at
that
his
arrow
followed
instantly
by
one
from
tsoay
there
was
a
cry
scaling
up
in
a
scream
which
made
travis
flinch
not
because
of
the
sound
but
because
of
the
hint
which
lay
behind
it
could
it
have
been
a
human
cry
the
thing
flopped
out
into
a
patch
of
moonlight
it
was
its
body
silvery
and
it
was
large
but
the
worst
was
that
it
had
been
groveling
on
all
fours
when
it
fell
and
now
it
was
rising
on
its
hind
feet
one
forepaw
striking
madly
at
the
two
arrows
dancing
in
its
upper
shoulder
man
no
but
something
sufficiently
manlike
to
chill
the
three
downtrail
a
whirling
hunter
dashed
in
snapped
at
the
creature
legs
and
it
squalled
again
aiming
a
blow
with
a
forepaw
but
the
attacking
coyote
was
already
gone
together
naginlta
and
were
harassing
the
creature
just
as
they
had
fought
the
split
horn
giving
the
hunters
time
to
shoot
travis
although
he
again
felt
that
touch
of
horror
and
disgust
he
could
not
account
for
shot
again
between
them
the
apaches
must
have
sent
a
dozen
arrows
into
the
raving
beast
before
it
went
to
its
knees
and
naginlta
sprang
for
its
throat
even
then
the
coyote
yelped
and
flinched
a
bleeding
gash
across
its
head
from
the
raking
talons
of
the
dying
thing
when
it
no
longer
moved
travis
approached
to
see
more
closely
what
they
had
brought
down
that
smell
just
as
the
embroidery
on
kaydessa
jacket
had
awakened
memories
from
his
terran
past
so
did
this
stench
remind
him
of
something
where
when
had
he
smelled
it
before
travis
connected
it
with
dark
dark
and
danger
then
he
gasped
in
a
half
exclamation
not
on
this
world
no
but
on
two
others
two
worlds
of
that
broken
stellar
empire
where
he
had
been
an
involuntary
explorer
two
planet
years
ago
the
beast
things
which
had
lived
in
the
dark
of
the
desert
world
the
terrans
wandering
galactic
derelict
had
landed
upon
yes
the
beast
things
whose
nature
they
had
never
been
able
to
deduce
were
they
the
degenerate
dregs
of
a
once
intelligent
species
or
were
they
animals
akin
to
man
but
still
animals
the
had
controlled
the
night
of
the
desert
world
and
they
had
been
met
again
also
in
the
dark
in
the
ruins
of
the
city
which
had
been
the
final
goal
of
the
ship
taped
voyage
so
they
were
a
part
of
the
vanished
civilization
and
travis
own
vague
surmise
concerning
topaz
was
proven
correct
this
had
not
been
an
empty
world
for
the
space
people
this
planet
had
a
purpose
and
a
use
or
else
this
beast
would
not
have
been
here
devil
kaydessa
made
a
face
of
disgust
you
know
it
tsoay
asked
travis
what
is
it
that
i
do
not
know
but
it
is
a
thing
left
over
from
the
star
time
and
i
have
seen
it
on
two
other
of
their
worlds
a
man
tsoay
surveyed
the
body
critically
it
wears
no
clothes
has
no
weapons
but
it
walks
erect
it
looks
like
an
ape
a
very
big
ape
it
is
not
a
good
thing
i
think
if
it
runs
with
a
pack
as
they
do
elsewhere
this
could
be
a
very
bad
thing
travis
remembering
how
these
creatures
had
attacked
in
force
on
the
other
worlds
looked
about
him
apprehensively
even
with
the
coyotes
on
guard
they
could
not
stand
up
to
such
a
pack
closing
in
through
the
dark
they
had
better
hole
up
in
some
defendable
place
and
wait
out
the
rest
of
the
night
naginlta
brought
them
to
a
cliff
overhang
where
they
could
set
their
backs
to
the
hard
rock
of
the
mountain
face
outward
to
a
space
they
could
cover
with
arrow
flight
if
the
need
arose
and
the
coyotes
lying
before
them
with
their
noses
resting
on
paws
would
travis
knew
alert
them
long
before
the
enemy
could
close
in
they
huddled
against
the
rock
kaydessa
between
them
alert
at
first
to
every
sound
of
the
night
their
hearts
beating
faster
at
a
small
scrape
of
gravel
the
rustle
of
a
bush
slowly
they
began
to
relax
it
is
well
that
two
sleep
while
one
guards
travis
observed
by
morning
we
must
push
on
out
of
this
country
so
the
two
apaches
shared
the
watch
in
turn
the
tatar
girl
at
first
protesting
and
then
falling
exhausted
into
a
slumber
which
left
her
breathing
heavily
travis
on
the
dawn
watch
began
to
speculate
about
the
they
had
killed
the
two
previous
times
he
had
met
this
creature
it
had
been
in
ruins
of
the
old
empire
were
there
ruins
somewhere
here
he
wanted
to
make
sure
about
that
on
the
other
hand
there
was
the
problem
of
the
settlement
controlled
by
the
reds
there
was
no
doubt
in
his
mind
that
were
the
reds
to
suspect
the
existence
of
the
apache
camp
they
would
make
every
attempt
to
hunt
down
and
kill
or
capture
the
survivors
from
the
american
ship
a
warning
must
be
carried
to
the
rancheria
as
quickly
as
they
could
make
the
return
trip
beside
him
the
girl
stirred
raising
her
head
travis
glanced
at
her
and
then
watched
with
attention
she
was
looking
straight
ahead
her
eyes
as
fixed
as
if
she
were
in
a
trance
now
she
inched
forward
from
the
mountain
wall
wriggling
out
of
its
shelter
what
tsoay
had
awakened
again
but
travis
was
already
moving
he
pushed
on
rushing
up
to
stand
beside
her
shoulder
to
shoulder
what
is
it
where
do
you
go
he
asked
she
made
no
answer
did
not
even
seem
aware
of
his
voice
he
caught
at
her
arm
and
she
pulled
to
free
herself
when
he
tightened
his
grip
she
did
not
fight
him
actively
as
during
their
first
encounter
but
merely
pulled
and
twisted
as
if
she
were
being
compelled
to
go
ahead
compulsion
he
remembered
her
plea
the
night
before
asking
his
help
against
recapture
by
the
machine
now
he
deliberately
tripped
her
twisted
her
hands
behind
her
back
she
swayed
in
his
hold
trying
to
win
to
her
feet
paying
no
attention
to
him
save
as
a
hindrance
against
her
answering
that
demanding
call
he
could
not
hear
what
happened
tsoay
took
a
swift
stride
stood
over
the
writhing
girl
whose
strength
was
now
such
that
travis
had
to
exert
all
his
efforts
to
control
her
i
think
that
the
machine
she
spoke
about
is
holding
her
she
is
being
drawn
to
it
out
of
hiding
as
one
draws
a
calf
on
a
rope
both
coyotes
had
arisen
and
were
watching
the
struggle
with
interest
but
there
was
no
warning
from
them
whatever
called
kaydessa
into
such
mindless
and
answer
did
not
touch
the
animals
and
neither
apache
felt
it
so
perhaps
only
kaydessa
people
were
subject
to
it
as
she
had
thought
how
far
away
was
that
machine
not
too
near
for
otherwise
the
coyotes
would
have
traced
the
man
or
men
operating
it
we
can
not
move
her
tsoay
brought
the
problem
into
the
open
unless
we
bind
and
carry
her
she
is
one
of
their
kind
why
not
let
her
go
to
them
unless
you
fear
she
will
talk
his
hand
went
to
the
knife
in
his
belt
and
travis
knew
what
primitive
impulse
moved
in
the
younger
man
in
the
old
days
a
captive
who
was
likely
to
give
trouble
was
efficiently
eliminated
in
tsoay
that
memory
was
awake
now
travis
shook
his
head
she
has
said
that
others
of
her
kin
are
in
these
hills
we
must
not
set
two
wolf
packs
hunting
us
travis
said
giving
the
more
practical
reason
which
might
better
appeal
to
that
savage
instinct
for
but
you
are
right
since
she
has
tried
to
answer
this
summons
we
can
not
force
her
with
us
therefore
do
you
take
the
back
trail
tell
buck
what
we
have
discovered
and
have
him
make
the
necessary
precautions
against
either
these
mongol
outlaws
or
a
red
thrust
over
the
mountains
and
you
i
stay
to
discover
where
the
outlaws
hide
and
learn
all
i
can
of
this
settlement
we
may
have
reason
to
need
friends
friends
tsoay
spat
the
people
need
no
friends
if
we
have
warning
we
can
hold
our
own
country
as
the
have
discovered
before
bows
and
arrows
against
guns
and
machines
travis
inquired
bitingly
we
must
know
more
before
we
make
any
warrior
boasts
for
the
future
tell
buck
what
we
have
discovered
also
say
i
will
join
you
before
travis
calculated
ten
suns
if
i
do
not
send
no
search
party
the
clan
is
too
small
to
risk
more
lives
for
one
and
if
these
reds
take
you
travis
grinned
not
pleasantly
they
shall
learn
nothing
can
their
machines
sort
out
the
thoughts
of
a
dead
man
he
did
not
intend
his
future
to
end
as
abruptly
as
that
but
also
he
would
not
be
easy
meat
for
any
red
hunting
party
tsoay
took
a
share
of
their
rations
and
refused
the
company
of
the
coyotes
travis
realized
that
for
all
his
seeming
ease
with
the
animals
the
younger
scout
had
little
more
liking
for
them
than
deklay
and
the
others
back
at
the
rancheria
tsoay
went
at
dawn
aiming
at
the
pass
travis
sat
down
beside
kaydessa
they
had
bound
her
to
a
small
tree
and
she
strove
incessantly
to
free
herself
turning
her
head
at
an
acute
and
painful
angle
only
to
face
the
same
direction
in
which
she
had
been
tied
there
was
no
breaking
the
spell
which
held
her
and
she
would
soon
wear
herself
out
with
that
struggling
then
he
struck
an
expert
blow
the
girl
sagged
limply
and
he
untied
her
it
all
depended
now
on
the
range
of
the
beam
or
broadcast
of
that
diabolical
machine
from
the
attitude
of
the
coyotes
he
assumed
that
those
using
the
machine
had
not
made
any
attempt
to
come
close
they
might
not
even
know
where
their
quarry
was
they
would
simply
sit
and
wait
in
the
foothills
for
the
caller
to
reel
in
a
helpless
captive
travis
thought
that
if
he
moved
kaydessa
farther
away
from
that
point
sooner
or
later
they
would
be
out
of
range
and
she
would
awake
from
the
knockout
free
again
although
she
was
not
light
he
could
manage
to
carry
her
for
a
while
so
burdened
travis
started
on
with
the
coyotes
scouting
ahead
he
speedily
discovered
that
he
had
set
himself
an
ambitious
task
the
going
was
rough
and
carrying
the
girl
reduced
his
advance
to
a
crawl
but
it
gave
him
time
to
make
careful
plans
as
long
as
the
reds
held
the
balance
of
power
on
this
side
of
the
mountain
range
the
rancheria
was
in
danger
bows
and
knives
against
modern
armament
was
no
contest
at
all
and
it
would
only
be
a
matter
of
time
before
exploration
on
the
part
of
the
northern
settlement
or
some
tracking
down
of
tatar
fugitives
would
bring
the
enemy
across
the
pass
the
apaches
could
move
farther
south
into
the
unknown
continent
below
the
wrecked
ship
thus
prolonging
the
time
before
they
were
discovered
but
that
would
only
postpone
the
inevitable
showdown
whether
travis
could
make
his
clan
believe
that
was
also
a
matter
of
concern
on
the
other
hand
if
the
red
overlords
could
be
met
in
some
practical
way
travis
mind
fastened
on
that
more
attractive
idea
worrying
it
as
naginlta
worried
a
prey
tearing
out
and
devouring
the
more
delicate
portions
every
bit
of
sense
and
prudence
argued
against
such
an
approach
whose
success
could
rest
only
between
improbability
and
impossibility
yet
that
was
the
direction
in
which
he
longed
to
move
across
his
shoulder
kaydessa
stirred
and
moaned
the
apache
doubled
his
efforts
to
reach
the
outcrop
of
rock
he
could
see
ahead
chiseled
into
high
relief
by
the
winds
in
its
lee
they
would
have
protection
from
any
sighting
from
below
panting
he
made
it
lowering
the
girl
into
the
guarded
cup
of
space
and
waited
she
moaned
again
lifted
one
hand
to
her
head
her
eyes
were
half
open
and
still
he
could
not
be
sure
whether
they
focused
on
him
and
her
surroundings
intelligently
or
not
kaydessa
her
heavy
eyelids
lifted
and
he
had
no
doubt
she
could
see
him
but
there
was
no
recognition
of
his
identity
in
her
gaze
only
surprise
and
fear
the
same
expression
she
had
worn
during
their
first
meeting
in
the
foothills
daughter
of
the
wolf
he
spoke
slowly
remember
travis
made
that
an
order
an
emphatic
appeal
to
the
mind
under
the
influence
of
the
caller
she
frowned
the
struggle
she
was
making
naked
on
her
face
then
she
answered
you
fox
travis
grunted
with
relief
his
alarm
subsiding
then
she
remember
yes
he
responded
eagerly
but
she
was
gazing
about
her
puzzlement
growing
where
is
this
we
are
higher
in
the
mountains
now
fear
was
pushing
out
bewilderment
how
did
i
come
here
i
brought
you
swiftly
he
outlined
what
had
happened
at
their
night
camp
the
hand
which
had
been
at
her
head
was
now
pressed
tight
across
her
lips
as
if
she
were
biting
furiously
into
its
flesh
to
still
some
panic
of
her
own
and
her
gray
eyes
were
round
and
haunted
you
are
free
now
travis
said
kaydessa
nodded
and
then
dropped
her
hand
to
speak
you
brought
me
away
from
the
hunters
you
did
not
have
to
obey
them
i
heard
nothing
you
do
not
hear
you
feel
she
shuddered
please
she
clawed
at
the
stone
beside
her
pulling
up
to
her
feet
let
us
go
let
us
go
quickly
they
will
try
again
move
farther
in
listen
travis
had
to
be
sure
of
one
thing
have
they
any
way
of
knowing
that
they
had
you
under
control
and
that
you
have
again
escaped
kaydessa
shook
her
head
some
of
the
panic
again
shadowing
her
eyes
then
we
just
go
on
his
chin
lifted
to
the
wastelands
before
them
try
to
keep
out
of
their
reach
and
away
from
the
pass
to
the
south
he
told
himself
silently
he
dared
not
lead
the
enemy
to
that
secret
so
he
must
travel
west
or
hole
up
somewhere
in
this
unknown
wilderness
until
they
could
be
sure
kaydessa
was
no
longer
susceptible
to
that
call
or
that
they
were
safely
beyond
its
beamed
radius
there
was
the
chance
of
contacting
her
outlaw
kin
just
as
there
was
the
chance
of
stumbling
into
a
pack
of
the
before
dark
they
must
discover
a
protected
camp
site
they
needed
water
food
he
had
a
bare
half
dozen
ration
tablets
but
the
coyotes
could
locate
water
come
travis
beckoned
to
kaydessa
motioning
her
to
climb
ahead
of
him
so
that
he
could
watch
for
any
indication
of
her
succumbing
once
again
to
the
influence
of
the
enemy
but
his
burdened
early
morning
flight
had
told
on
travis
more
than
he
thought
and
he
discovered
he
could
not
spur
himself
on
to
a
pace
better
than
a
walk
now
and
again
one
of
the
coyotes
usually
would
come
into
view
express
impatience
in
both
stance
and
mental
signal
and
then
be
gone
again
the
apache
was
increasingly
aware
that
the
animals
were
disturbed
yet
to
his
tentative
gropings
at
contact
they
did
not
reply
since
they
gave
no
warning
of
hostile
animal
or
man
he
could
only
be
on
constant
guard
watching
the
countryside
about
him
they
had
been
following
a
ledge
for
several
minutes
before
travis
was
aware
of
some
strange
features
of
that
path
perhaps
he
had
actually
noted
them
with
a
trained
eye
before
his
archaeological
studies
of
the
recent
past
gave
him
a
reason
for
the
faint
marks
this
crack
in
the
mountain
skin
might
have
begun
as
a
natural
fault
but
afterward
it
had
been
worked
with
tools
smoothed
widened
to
serve
the
purpose
of
some
form
of
intelligence
travis
caught
at
kaydessa
shoulder
to
slow
her
pace
he
could
not
have
told
why
he
did
not
want
to
speak
aloud
here
but
he
felt
the
need
for
silence
she
glanced
around
perplexed
more
so
when
he
went
down
on
his
knees
and
ran
his
fingers
along
one
of
those
ancient
tool
marks
he
was
certain
it
was
very
old
inside
of
him
anticipation
bubbled
a
road
made
with
such
labor
could
only
lead
to
something
of
importance
he
was
going
to
make
the
discovery
the
dream
which
had
first
drawn
him
into
these
mountains
what
is
it
kaydessa
knelt
beside
him
frowning
at
the
ledge
this
was
cut
by
someone
a
long
time
ago
travis
half
whispered
and
then
wondered
why
there
was
no
reason
to
believe
the
road
makers
could
hear
him
when
perhaps
a
thousand
years
or
more
lay
between
the
chipping
of
that
stone
and
this
day
the
tatar
girl
looked
over
her
shoulder
perhaps
she
too
was
troubled
by
the
sense
that
here
time
was
subtly
telescoped
that
past
and
present
might
be
meeting
or
was
that
feeling
with
them
both
because
of
their
enforced
conditioning
who
now
her
voice
sank
in
turn
listen
he
regarded
her
intently
did
your
people
or
the
reds
ever
find
any
traces
of
the
old
civilization
here
ruins
no
she
leaned
forward
tracing
with
her
own
finger
the
same
marks
which
had
intrigued
travis
but
i
think
they
have
looked
before
they
discovered
that
we
could
be
free
they
sent
out
parties
to
hunt
they
said
but
afterward
they
always
asked
many
questions
about
the
country
only
they
never
asked
about
ruins
is
that
what
they
wished
us
to
find
but
why
of
what
value
are
old
stones
piled
on
one
another
in
themselves
little
save
for
the
knowledge
they
may
give
us
of
the
people
who
piled
them
but
for
what
the
stones
might
contain
much
value
and
how
do
you
know
what
they
might
contain
fox
because
i
have
seen
such
treasure
houses
of
the
star
men
he
returned
absently
to
him
the
marks
on
the
ledge
were
a
pledge
of
greater
discoveries
to
come
he
must
find
where
that
carefully
constructed
road
ran
to
what
it
led
let
us
see
where
this
will
take
us
but
first
he
gave
the
chittering
signal
in
four
sharp
bursts
and
the
bodies
came
out
of
the
tangled
brush
bounding
up
to
the
ledge
together
the
coyotes
faced
him
their
attention
all
for
his
halting
communication
ruins
might
lie
ahead
he
hoped
that
they
did
but
on
another
planet
such
ruins
had
twice
proved
to
be
deadly
traps
and
only
good
fortune
had
prevented
their
closing
on
terran
explorers
if
the
or
any
other
dangerous
form
of
life
had
taken
up
residence
before
them
he
wanted
good
warning
together
the
coyotes
turned
and
loped
along
the
now
level
way
of
the
ledge
disappearing
around
a
curve
fitted
to
the
mountain
side
while
travis
and
kaydessa
followed
they
heard
it
before
they
saw
its
source
a
waterfall
probably
not
a
large
one
but
high
rounding
the
curve
they
came
into
a
fine
mist
of
spray
where
sunlight
made
rainbows
of
color
across
a
filmy
veil
of
water
for
a
long
moment
they
stood
entranced
kaydessa
then
gave
a
little
cry
held
out
her
hands
to
the
purling
mist
and
brought
them
to
her
lips
again
to
suck
the
gathered
moisture
water
slicked
the
surface
of
the
ledge
and
travis
pushed
her
back
against
the
wall
of
the
cliff
as
far
as
he
could
discern
their
road
continued
behind
the
curtain
of
water
and
footing
on
the
wet
stone
was
treacherous
with
their
backs
to
the
solid
security
of
the
wall
facing
outward
into
the
solid
drape
of
water
they
edged
behind
it
and
came
out
into
rainbowed
sunlight
again
here
either
provident
nature
or
ancient
art
had
hollowed
a
pocket
in
the
stone
which
was
filled
with
water
they
drank
then
travis
filled
his
canteen
while
kaydessa
washed
her
face
holding
the
cold
freshness
of
the
moisture
to
her
cheeks
with
both
palms
she
spoke
but
he
could
not
hear
her
through
the
roar
she
leaned
closer
and
raised
her
voice
to
a
half
shout
this
is
a
place
of
spirits
do
you
not
also
feel
their
power
fox
perhaps
for
a
space
out
of
time
he
did
feel
something
this
was
a
watering
place
perhaps
a
watering
place
and
to
his
race
all
water
was
a
spirit
gift
never
to
be
taken
for
granted
the
rainbow
the
spirit
people
sacred
sign
old
beliefs
stirred
in
travis
moving
him
i
feel
he
said
nodding
in
emphasis
to
his
agreement
they
followed
the
ledge
road
to
a
section
where
a
landslide
of
an
earlier
season
had
choked
it
travis
worked
a
careful
way
across
the
debris
kaydessa
obeying
his
guidance
in
turn
then
they
were
on
a
sloping
downward
way
which
led
to
a
staircase
the
treads
and
crumbling
the
angle
so
steep
travis
wondered
if
it
had
ever
been
intended
for
beings
with
a
physique
approximating
the
terrans
they
came
to
a
cleft
where
an
arch
of
stone
was
chiseled
out
as
a
roofing
travis
thought
he
could
make
out
a
trace
of
carving
on
the
capstone
so
worn
by
years
and
weather
that
it
was
now
only
a
faint
shadow
of
design
the
cleft
was
a
door
into
another
valley
here
too
golden
mist
swirled
in
tendrils
to
disguise
and
cloak
what
stood
there
travis
had
found
his
ruins
only
the
structures
were
intact
not
breached
by
time
mist
flowed
in
lapping
tongues
back
and
forth
confusing
outlines
now
shuttering
now
baring
oval
windows
which
were
spaced
in
diamonds
of
four
on
round
tower
surfaces
there
were
no
visible
cracks
no
cloaking
of
climbing
vegetation
nothing
to
suggest
age
and
long
roots
in
the
valley
nor
did
the
architecture
he
could
view
match
any
he
had
seen
on
those
other
worlds
travis
strode
away
from
the
cleft
doorway
under
his
moccasins
was
a
block
pavement
yellow
and
green
stone
set
in
a
simple
pattern
of
checks
this
too
was
level
unchipped
and
undisturbed
save
for
a
drift
or
two
of
soil
driven
in
by
the
wind
and
nowhere
could
he
see
any
vegetation
the
towers
were
of
the
same
green
stone
as
half
the
pavement
blocks
a
glassy
green
which
made
him
think
of
jade
if
jade
could
be
mined
in
such
quantities
as
these
towers
demanded
padded
to
him
and
he
could
hear
the
faint
click
of
her
claws
on
the
pavement
there
was
a
deep
silence
in
this
place
as
if
the
air
itself
swallowed
and
digested
all
sound
the
wind
which
had
been
with
them
all
the
day
of
their
journeying
was
left
beyond
the
cleft
yet
there
was
life
here
the
coyote
told
him
that
in
her
own
way
she
had
not
made
up
her
mind
concerning
that
life
wariness
and
curiosity
warred
in
her
now
as
her
pointed
muzzle
lifted
toward
the
windows
overhead
the
windows
were
all
well
above
ground
level
but
there
was
no
opening
in
the
first
stories
as
far
as
travis
could
see
he
debated
moving
into
the
range
of
those
windows
to
investigate
the
far
side
of
the
towers
for
doorways
the
mist
and
the
message
from
nourished
his
suspicions
out
in
the
open
he
would
be
too
good
a
target
for
whatever
or
whoever
might
be
standing
within
the
frames
the
silence
was
shattered
by
a
boom
travis
jumped
slewed
half
around
knife
in
hand
a
second
heavy
then
a
clangor
with
a
swelling
echo
kaydessa
flung
back
her
head
and
called
her
voice
rising
up
as
if
tunneled
by
the
valley
walls
she
then
whistled
as
she
had
done
when
they
fronted
the
and
ran
on
to
catch
at
travis
sleeve
her
face
eager
my
people
come
it
is
my
people
she
tugged
him
on
before
breaking
into
a
run
weaving
fearlessly
around
the
base
of
one
of
the
towers
travis
ran
after
her
afraid
he
might
lose
her
in
the
mist
three
towers
another
stretch
of
open
pavement
and
then
the
mist
lifted
to
show
them
a
second
carved
doorway
not
two
hundred
yards
ahead
the
seemed
to
pull
kaydessa
and
travis
could
do
nothing
but
trail
her
the
coyotes
now
trotting
beside
him
they
burst
through
a
last
wide
band
of
mist
into
a
wilderness
of
tall
grass
and
shrubs
travis
heard
the
coyotes
give
tongue
but
it
was
too
late
out
of
nowhere
whirled
a
leather
loop
settling
about
his
chest
snapping
his
arms
tight
to
his
body
taking
him
off
his
feet
with
a
jerk
to
be
dragged
helplessly
along
the
ground
behind
a
galloping
horse
a
tawny
fury
sprang
in
the
air
to
snap
at
the
horse
head
travis
kicked
fruitlessly
trying
to
regain
his
feet
as
the
horse
reared
and
fought
against
the
control
of
his
shouting
rider
all
through
the
melee
the
apache
heard
kaydessa
shrilly
screaming
words
he
did
not
understand
travis
was
on
his
knees
coughing
in
the
dust
exerting
the
muscles
in
his
chest
and
shoulders
to
loosen
the
lariat
on
either
side
of
him
the
coyotes
wove
a
snarling
pattern
of
defiance
dashing
back
and
forth
to
present
no
target
for
the
enemy
yet
keeping
the
excited
horses
so
stirred
up
that
their
riders
could
use
neither
ropes
nor
blades
then
kaydessa
ran
between
two
of
the
ringing
horses
to
travis
and
jerked
at
the
loop
about
him
the
tough
braided
leather
eased
its
hold
and
he
was
able
to
gasp
in
full
lungfuls
of
air
she
was
still
shouting
but
the
tone
had
changed
from
one
of
recognition
to
a
definite
scolding
travis
won
to
his
feet
just
as
the
rider
who
had
lassoed
him
finally
got
his
horse
under
rein
and
dismounted
holding
the
rope
the
man
walked
hand
over
hand
toward
them
as
travis
back
on
the
arizona
range
would
have
approached
a
nervous
unschooled
pony
the
mongol
was
an
inch
or
so
shorter
than
the
apache
and
his
face
was
young
though
he
had
a
drooping
mustache
bracketing
his
mouth
with
slender
spear
points
of
black
hair
his
breeches
were
tucked
into
high
red
boots
and
he
wore
a
loose
felt
jacket
patterned
with
the
same
elaborate
embroidery
travis
had
seen
on
kaydessa
on
his
head
was
a
hat
with
a
wide
fur
border
in
spite
of
the
heat
and
that
too
bore
touches
of
scarlet
and
gold
design
still
holding
his
lariat
the
mongol
reached
kaydessa
and
stood
for
a
moment
eying
her
up
and
down
before
he
asked
a
question
she
gave
an
impatient
twitch
to
the
rope
the
coyotes
snarled
but
the
apache
thought
the
animals
no
longer
considered
the
danger
immediate
this
is
my
brother
hulagur
kaydessa
made
the
introduction
over
her
shoulder
he
does
not
have
your
speech
hulagur
not
only
did
not
understand
he
was
also
impatient
he
jerked
at
the
rope
with
such
sudden
force
that
travis
was
almost
thrown
then
kaydessa
dragged
as
fiercely
on
the
lariat
in
the
other
direction
and
burst
into
a
soaring
harangue
which
drew
the
rest
of
the
men
closer
travis
flexed
his
upper
arms
and
the
slack
gained
by
kaydessa
action
made
the
lariat
give
again
he
studied
the
tatar
outlaws
there
were
five
of
them
beside
hulagur
lean
men
the
ragged
clothing
of
three
pieced
out
with
scraps
of
hide
besides
the
swords
with
the
curved
blades
they
were
armed
with
bows
two
to
each
man
one
long
one
shorter
one
of
the
riders
carried
a
lance
long
tassels
of
woolly
hair
streaming
from
below
its
head
travis
saw
in
them
a
formidable
array
of
barbaric
fighting
men
but
he
thought
that
man
for
man
the
apaches
could
not
only
take
on
the
mongols
with
confidence
but
might
well
defeat
them
the
apache
had
never
been
a
fighter
like
the
cheyenne
the
sioux
and
the
comanche
of
the
open
plains
he
estimated
the
odds
against
him
used
ambush
trick
and
every
feature
of
the
countryside
as
weapon
and
defense
fifteen
apache
fighting
men
under
chief
geronimo
had
kept
five
thousand
american
and
mexican
troops
in
the
field
for
a
year
and
had
come
off
victorious
for
the
moment
travis
knew
the
tales
of
genghis
khan
and
his
formidable
generals
who
swept
over
asia
into
europe
unbeaten
and
seemingly
undefeatable
but
they
had
been
a
wild
wave
fed
by
a
reservoir
of
manpower
from
the
steppes
of
their
homeland
utilizing
driven
walls
of
captives
to
protect
their
own
men
in
city
assaults
and
attacks
he
doubted
if
even
that
endless
sea
of
men
could
have
won
the
arizona
desert
defended
by
apaches
under
cochise
victorio
or
magnus
colorado
the
white
man
had
done
it
by
superior
arms
and
attrition
but
bow
against
bow
knife
against
sword
craft
and
cunning
against
craft
and
cunning
he
did
not
think
so
hulagur
dropped
the
end
of
the
lariat
and
kaydessa
swung
around
loosening
the
loop
so
that
the
rope
fell
to
travis
feet
the
apache
stepped
free
of
it
turned
and
passed
between
two
of
the
horsemen
to
gather
up
the
bow
he
had
dropped
the
coyotes
had
gone
with
him
and
when
he
turned
again
to
face
the
company
of
tatars
both
animals
crowded
past
him
to
the
entrance
of
the
valley
plainly
urging
him
to
retire
there
the
horsemen
had
faced
about
also
and
the
warrior
with
the
lance
balanced
the
shaft
of
the
weapon
in
his
hand
as
if
considering
the
possibility
of
trying
to
spear
travis
but
just
then
kaydessa
came
up
towing
hulagur
by
a
firm
hold
on
his
i
have
told
this
one
she
reported
to
travis
how
it
is
between
us
and
that
you
also
are
enemy
to
those
who
hunt
us
it
is
well
that
you
sit
together
beside
a
fire
and
talk
of
these
things
again
that
broke
her
speech
coming
from
farther
out
in
the
open
land
you
will
do
this
she
made
of
it
a
half
question
half
statement
travis
glanced
about
him
he
could
dodge
back
into
the
misty
valley
of
the
towers
before
the
tatars
could
ride
him
down
however
if
he
could
patch
up
some
kind
of
truce
between
his
people
and
the
outlaws
the
apaches
would
have
only
the
reds
from
the
settlement
to
watch
too
many
times
in
terran
past
had
war
on
two
fronts
been
disastrous
i
come
carrying
this
and
not
pulled
by
your
ropes
he
held
up
his
bow
in
an
exaggerated
gesture
so
that
hulagur
could
understand
coiling
the
lariat
the
mongol
looked
from
the
apache
bow
to
travis
slowly
and
with
obvious
reluctance
he
nodded
agreement
at
hulagur
call
the
lancer
rode
up
to
the
waiting
apache
stretched
out
a
booted
foot
in
the
heavy
stirrup
and
held
down
a
hand
to
bring
travis
up
behind
him
riding
double
kaydessa
mounted
in
the
same
fashion
behind
her
brother
travis
looked
at
the
coyotes
together
the
animals
stood
in
the
door
to
the
tower
valley
and
neither
made
any
move
to
follow
as
the
horses
trotted
off
he
beckoned
with
his
hand
and
called
to
them
heads
up
they
continued
to
watch
him
go
in
company
with
the
mongols
then
without
any
reply
to
his
coaxing
they
melted
back
into
the
mists
for
a
moment
travis
was
tempted
to
slide
down
and
run
the
risk
of
taking
a
lance
point
between
the
shoulders
as
he
followed
naginlta
and
into
retreat
he
was
startled
jarred
by
the
new
awareness
of
how
much
he
had
come
to
depend
on
the
animals
ordinarily
travis
fox
was
not
one
to
be
governed
by
the
wishes
of
a
intelligent
and
as
it
might
be
this
was
an
affair
of
men
and
coyotes
had
no
part
in
it
half
an
hour
later
travis
sat
in
the
outlaw
camp
there
were
fifteen
mongols
in
sight
a
half
dozen
women
and
two
children
adding
to
the
count
on
a
hillock
near
their
yurts
the
round
shelters
not
too
different
from
the
wickiups
of
travis
own
people
was
a
crude
drum
a
hide
stretched
taut
over
a
hollowed
section
of
log
and
next
to
that
stood
a
man
wearing
a
tall
pointed
cap
a
red
robe
and
a
girdle
from
which
swung
a
fringe
of
small
bones
tiny
animal
skulls
and
polished
bits
of
stone
and
carved
wood
it
was
this
man
efforts
which
sent
the
sounding
at
intervals
over
the
landscape
was
this
a
signal
part
of
a
ritual
travis
was
not
certain
though
he
guessed
that
the
drummer
was
either
medicine
man
or
shaman
and
so
of
some
power
in
this
company
such
men
were
credited
with
the
ability
to
prophesy
and
also
endowed
with
mediumship
between
man
and
spirit
in
the
old
days
of
the
great
hordes
the
apache
evaluated
the
rest
of
the
company
as
was
true
of
his
own
party
these
men
were
much
the
same
age
young
and
vigorous
and
it
was
also
apparent
that
hulagur
held
a
position
of
some
importance
among
them
if
he
were
not
their
chief
after
a
last
resounding
roll
on
the
drum
the
shaman
thrust
the
sticks
into
his
girdle
and
came
down
to
the
fire
at
the
center
of
the
camp
he
was
taller
than
his
fellows
pole
thin
under
his
robes
his
face
narrow
with
brows
arched
by
nature
to
give
him
an
unchanging
expression
of
scepticism
he
strode
along
his
tinkling
collection
of
charms
providing
him
with
a
not
unmusical
accompaniment
and
came
to
stand
directly
before
travis
eying
him
carefully
travis
copied
his
silence
in
what
was
close
to
a
duel
of
wills
there
was
that
in
the
shaman
narrowed
green
eyes
which
suggested
that
if
hulagur
did
in
fact
lead
these
fighting
men
he
had
an
advisor
of
determination
and
intelligence
behind
him
this
is
menlik
kaydessa
did
not
push
past
the
men
to
the
fireside
but
her
voice
carried
hulagur
growled
at
his
sister
but
his
admonition
made
no
impression
on
her
and
she
replied
in
as
hot
a
tone
the
shaman
hand
went
up
silencing
both
of
them
you
are
who
like
kaydessa
menlik
spoke
a
heavily
accented
english
i
am
travis
fox
of
the
apaches
the
apaches
the
shaman
repeated
you
are
of
the
west
the
american
west
then
you
know
much
man
of
spirit
talk
one
remembers
at
times
one
remembers
menlik
answered
almost
absently
how
does
an
apache
find
his
way
across
the
stars
the
same
way
menlik
and
his
people
did
travis
returned
you
were
sent
to
settle
this
planet
and
so
were
we
there
are
many
more
of
you
countered
menlik
swiftly
are
there
not
many
of
the
horde
would
one
man
or
three
or
four
be
sent
to
hold
a
world
travis
fenced
you
hold
the
north
we
the
south
of
this
land
but
are
not
governed
by
a
machine
kaydessa
cut
in
they
are
free
menlik
frowned
at
the
girl
woman
this
is
a
matter
for
warriors
keep
your
tongue
silent
between
your
jaws
she
stamped
one
foot
standing
with
her
fists
on
her
hips
i
am
a
daughter
of
the
blue
wolf
and
we
are
all
warriors
men
and
women
alike
so
shall
we
be
as
long
as
the
horde
is
not
free
to
ride
where
we
wish
these
men
have
won
their
freedom
it
is
well
that
we
learn
how
menlik
expression
did
not
change
but
his
lids
drooped
over
his
eyes
as
a
murmur
of
what
might
be
agreement
came
from
the
group
more
than
one
of
them
must
have
understood
enough
english
to
translate
for
the
others
travis
wondered
about
that
had
these
men
and
women
who
had
outwardly
reverted
to
the
life
of
their
nomad
ancestors
once
been
well
educated
in
the
modern
sense
educated
enough
to
learn
the
basic
language
of
the
nation
their
rulers
had
set
up
as
their
principal
enemy
so
you
ride
the
land
south
of
the
mountains
the
shaman
continued
that
is
true
then
why
did
you
come
hither
travis
shrugged
why
does
anyone
ride
or
travel
into
new
lands
there
is
a
desire
to
see
what
may
lie
beyond
or
to
scout
before
the
march
of
warriors
menlik
snapped
there
is
no
peace
between
your
rulers
and
mine
do
you
ride
now
to
take
the
herds
and
pastures
of
the
horde
or
to
try
to
do
so
travis
turned
his
head
deliberately
from
side
to
side
allowing
them
all
to
witness
his
slow
and
openly
contemptuous
appraisal
of
their
camp
is
your
horde
shaman
fifteen
warriors
much
has
changed
since
the
days
of
temujin
has
it
not
what
do
you
know
of
temujin
you
who
are
a
man
of
no
ancestors
out
of
the
west
what
do
i
know
of
temujin
that
he
was
a
leader
of
warriors
and
became
genghis
khan
the
great
lord
of
the
east
but
the
apaches
had
their
warlords
also
rider
of
barren
lands
and
i
am
of
those
who
raided
over
two
nations
when
victorio
and
cochise
scattered
their
enemies
as
a
man
scatters
a
handful
of
dust
in
the
wind
you
talk
bold
apache
there
was
a
hint
of
threat
in
that
i
speak
as
any
warrior
shaman
or
are
you
so
used
to
talking
with
spirits
instead
of
men
that
you
do
not
realize
that
he
might
have
been
alienating
the
shaman
by
such
a
sharp
reply
but
travis
thought
he
judged
the
temper
of
these
people
to
face
them
boldly
was
the
only
way
to
impress
them
they
would
not
treat
with
an
inferior
and
he
was
already
at
a
disadvantage
coming
on
foot
without
any
backing
in
force
into
a
territory
held
by
horsemen
who
were
suspicious
and
jealous
of
their
recently
acquired
freedom
his
only
chance
was
to
establish
himself
as
an
equal
and
then
try
to
convince
them
that
apache
and
had
a
common
cause
against
the
reds
who
controlled
the
settlement
on
the
northern
plains
menlik
right
hand
went
to
his
and
plucked
out
a
carved
stick
which
he
waved
between
them
muttering
phrases
travis
could
not
understand
had
the
shaman
retreated
so
far
along
the
road
to
his
past
that
he
now
believed
in
his
own
supernatural
powers
or
was
this
to
impress
his
watching
followers
you
call
upon
your
spirits
for
aid
menlik
but
the
apache
has
the
companionship
of
the
ask
of
kaydessa
who
hunts
with
the
fox
in
the
wilds
travis
sharp
challenge
stopped
that
wand
in
menlik
head
swung
to
the
girl
he
hunts
with
wolves
who
think
like
men
she
supplied
the
information
the
shaman
would
not
openly
ask
for
i
have
seen
them
act
as
his
scouts
this
is
no
spirit
thing
but
real
and
of
this
world
any
man
may
train
a
dog
to
his
bidding
menlik
spat
does
a
dog
obey
orders
which
are
not
said
aloud
these
brown
wolves
come
and
sit
before
him
look
into
his
eyes
and
then
he
knows
what
lies
within
their
heads
and
they
know
what
he
would
have
them
do
this
is
not
the
way
of
a
master
of
hounds
with
his
pack
again
the
murmur
ran
about
the
camp
as
one
or
two
translated
menlik
frowned
then
he
rammed
his
sorcerer
wand
back
into
his
sash
if
you
are
a
man
of
power
such
powers
he
said
slowly
then
you
may
walk
alone
where
those
who
talk
with
spirits
go
into
the
mountains
he
then
spoke
over
his
shoulder
in
his
native
tongue
and
one
of
the
women
reached
behind
her
into
a
hut
brought
out
a
skin
bag
and
a
horn
cup
kaydessa
took
the
cup
from
her
and
held
it
while
the
other
woman
poured
a
white
liquid
from
the
bag
to
fill
it
kaydessa
passed
the
cup
to
menlik
he
pivoted
with
it
in
his
hand
dribbling
expertly
over
its
brim
a
few
drops
at
each
point
of
the
compass
chanting
as
he
moved
then
he
sucked
in
a
mouthful
of
the
contents
before
presenting
the
vessel
to
travis
the
apache
smelled
the
same
sour
scent
that
had
clung
to
the
emptied
bag
in
the
foothills
and
another
part
of
memory
supplied
him
with
the
nature
of
the
drink
this
was
kumiss
a
fermented
mare
milk
which
was
the
wine
and
water
of
the
steppes
he
forced
himself
to
swallow
a
draft
though
it
was
alien
to
his
taste
and
passed
the
cup
back
to
menlik
the
shaman
emptied
the
horn
and
with
that
set
aside
ceremony
with
an
upraised
hand
he
beckoned
travis
to
the
fire
again
indicating
a
pot
set
on
the
coals
rest
eat
he
bade
abruptly
night
was
gathering
in
travis
tried
to
calculate
how
far
tsoay
must
have
backtracked
to
the
rancheria
he
thought
that
he
could
have
already
made
the
pass
and
be
within
a
day
and
a
half
from
the
apache
camp
if
he
pushed
on
as
he
would
as
to
where
the
coyotes
were
travis
had
no
idea
but
it
was
plain
that
he
himself
must
remain
in
this
encampment
for
the
night
or
risk
rousing
the
mongols
suspicion
once
more
he
ate
of
the
stew
spearing
chunks
out
of
the
pot
with
the
point
of
his
knife
and
it
was
not
until
he
sat
back
his
hunger
appeased
that
the
shaman
dropped
down
beside
him
the
khatun
kaydessa
says
that
when
she
was
slave
to
the
caller
you
did
not
feel
its
chains
he
began
those
who
rule
you
are
not
my
overlords
the
bonds
they
set
upon
your
minds
do
not
touch
me
travis
hoped
that
that
was
the
truth
and
his
escape
that
morning
had
not
been
just
a
fluke
this
could
be
for
you
and
i
are
not
of
one
blood
menlik
agreed
tell
me
how
did
you
escape
your
bonds
the
machine
which
held
us
so
was
broken
travis
replied
with
a
portion
of
the
truth
and
menlik
sucked
in
his
breath
the
machines
always
the
machines
he
cried
hoarsely
a
thing
which
can
sit
in
a
man
head
and
make
him
do
what
it
will
against
his
will
it
is
demon
sent
there
are
other
machines
to
be
broken
apache
words
will
not
break
them
travis
pointed
out
only
a
fool
rides
to
his
death
without
hope
of
striking
a
single
blow
before
he
chokes
on
the
blood
in
his
throat
menlik
retorted
we
can
not
use
bow
or
tulwar
against
weapons
which
flame
and
kill
quicker
than
any
storm
lightning
and
always
the
mind
machines
can
make
a
man
drop
his
knife
and
stand
helplessly
waiting
for
the
slave
collar
to
be
set
on
his
neck
travis
asked
a
question
of
his
own
i
know
that
they
can
bring
a
caller
part
way
into
this
mountain
for
this
very
day
i
saw
its
effect
upon
the
maiden
but
there
are
many
places
in
the
hills
well
set
for
ambushes
and
those
unaffected
by
the
machine
could
be
waiting
there
would
there
be
many
machines
so
that
they
could
send
out
again
and
again
menlik
bony
hand
played
with
his
wand
then
a
slow
smile
curved
his
lips
into
the
guise
of
a
hunting
cat
noiseless
snarl
there
is
meat
in
that
pot
apache
rich
meat
good
for
the
filling
of
a
lean
belly
so
men
whose
minds
the
machine
could
not
trouble
such
men
to
be
waiting
in
ambush
for
the
taking
of
the
men
who
use
such
a
machine
yes
but
here
would
have
to
be
bait
very
good
bait
for
such
a
trap
lord
of
wiles
never
do
those
others
come
far
into
the
mountains
their
flyer
does
not
lift
well
here
and
they
do
not
trust
traveling
on
horseback
they
were
greatly
angered
to
come
so
far
in
to
reach
kaydessa
though
they
could
not
have
been
too
close
or
you
would
not
have
escaped
at
all
yes
strong
bait
such
bait
as
perhaps
the
knowledge
that
there
were
strangers
across
the
mountains
menlik
turned
his
wand
about
in
his
hands
he
was
no
longer
smiling
and
his
glance
at
travis
was
sharp
and
swift
do
you
sit
as
khan
in
your
tribe
lord
i
sit
as
one
they
will
listen
to
travis
hoped
that
was
so
whether
buck
and
the
moderates
would
hold
clan
leadership
upon
his
return
was
a
fact
he
could
not
count
upon
as
certain
this
is
a
thing
which
we
must
hold
council
over
menlik
continued
but
it
is
an
idea
of
power
yes
one
to
think
about
lord
and
i
shall
think
he
got
up
and
moved
away
travis
blinked
at
the
fire
he
was
very
tired
and
he
disliked
sleeping
in
this
camp
but
he
must
not
go
without
the
rest
his
body
needed
to
supply
him
with
a
clear
head
in
the
morning
and
not
showing
uneasiness
might
be
one
way
of
winning
menlik
confidence
travis
settled
his
back
against
the
spire
of
rock
and
raised
his
right
hand
into
the
path
of
the
sun
cradling
in
his
palm
a
disk
of
glistening
metal
flash
flash
he
made
the
signal
pattern
just
as
his
ancestors
a
hundred
years
earlier
and
far
across
space
had
used
trade
mirrors
to
relay
war
alerts
among
the
chiricahua
and
white
mountain
ranges
if
tsoay
had
returned
safely
and
if
buck
had
kept
the
agreed
lookout
on
that
peak
a
mile
or
so
ahead
then
the
clan
would
know
that
he
was
coming
and
with
what
escort
he
waited
now
rubbing
the
small
metal
mirror
absently
on
the
loose
sleeve
of
his
shirt
waiting
for
a
reply
mirrors
were
best
not
smoke
fires
which
would
broadcast
too
far
the
presence
of
men
in
the
hills
tsoay
must
have
returned
what
is
it
that
you
do
menlik
his
shaman
robe
pulled
up
so
that
his
breeches
and
boots
were
dark
against
the
golden
rock
climbed
up
beside
the
apache
menlik
hulagur
and
kaydessa
were
riding
with
travis
offering
him
one
of
their
small
ponies
to
hurry
the
trip
he
was
still
regarded
warily
by
the
tatars
but
he
did
not
blame
them
for
their
cautious
attitude
ah
a
flicker
of
light
from
the
point
ahead
one
two
three
flashes
a
pause
then
two
more
together
he
had
been
read
buck
had
dispatched
scouts
to
meet
them
and
knowing
his
people
skill
at
the
business
travis
was
certain
the
tatars
would
never
suspect
their
flanking
unless
the
apaches
purposefully
revealed
themselves
also
the
tatars
were
not
to
go
to
the
rancheria
but
would
be
met
at
a
by
a
delegation
of
apaches
this
was
no
time
for
the
tatars
to
learn
just
how
few
the
clan
numbered
menlik
watched
travis
flash
an
acknowledgment
to
the
sentry
ahead
in
this
way
you
speak
to
your
men
this
way
i
speak
a
thing
good
and
to
be
remembered
we
have
the
drum
but
that
is
for
the
ears
of
all
with
hearing
this
is
for
the
eyes
only
of
those
on
watch
for
it
yes
a
good
thing
and
your
people
they
will
meet
with
us
they
wait
ahead
travis
confirmed
it
was
close
to
midday
and
the
heat
gathered
in
the
rocky
ways
was
like
a
heaviness
in
the
air
itself
the
tatars
had
shucked
their
heavy
jackets
and
rolled
the
fur
brims
of
their
hats
far
up
their
heads
away
from
their
faces
and
at
every
halt
they
passed
from
hand
to
hand
the
skin
bag
of
kumiss
now
even
the
ponies
shuffled
on
with
drooping
heads
picking
a
way
in
a
cut
which
deepened
into
a
canyon
travis
kept
a
watch
for
the
scouts
and
not
for
the
first
time
he
thought
of
the
disappearance
of
the
coyotes
somehow
back
in
the
tatar
camp
he
had
counted
confidently
on
the
animals
rejoining
him
once
he
had
started
his
return
over
the
mountains
but
he
had
seen
nothing
of
either
beast
nor
had
he
felt
that
unexplainable
mental
contact
with
them
which
had
been
present
since
his
first
awakening
on
topaz
why
they
had
left
him
so
unceremoniously
after
defending
him
from
the
mongol
attack
and
why
they
were
keeping
themselves
aloof
now
he
did
not
know
but
he
was
conscious
of
a
thread
of
alarm
for
their
continued
absence
and
he
hoped
he
would
find
they
had
gone
back
to
the
rancheria
the
ponies
thudded
dispiritedly
along
a
sandy
wash
which
bottomed
the
canyon
here
the
heat
became
a
leaden
weight
and
the
men
were
panting
like
beasts
running
before
hunters
finally
travis
sighted
what
he
had
been
seeking
a
flicker
of
movement
on
the
wall
well
above
he
flung
up
his
hand
pulling
his
mount
to
a
stand
apaches
stood
in
full
view
bows
ready
arrows
on
cords
but
they
made
no
sound
kaydessa
cried
out
booted
her
mount
to
draw
equal
with
travis
a
trap
her
face
flushed
with
heat
was
also
stark
with
anger
travis
smiled
slowly
is
there
a
rope
about
you
wolf
daughter
he
inquired
softly
are
you
now
dragged
across
this
sand
her
mouth
opened
and
then
closed
again
the
quirt
she
had
half
raised
to
slash
at
him
flopped
across
her
pony
neck
the
apache
glanced
back
at
the
two
men
hulagur
hand
was
on
his
sword
hilt
his
eyes
darting
from
one
of
those
silent
watchers
to
the
next
but
the
utter
hopelessness
of
the
tatar
position
was
too
plain
only
menlik
made
no
move
toward
any
weapon
even
his
spirit
wand
instead
he
sat
quietly
in
the
saddle
displaying
no
emotion
toward
the
apaches
save
his
usual
detachment
we
go
on
travis
pointed
ahead
just
as
suddenly
as
they
had
appeared
from
the
heart
of
the
golden
cliffs
so
did
the
scouts
vanish
most
of
them
were
already
on
their
way
to
the
point
buck
had
selected
for
the
meeting
place
there
had
been
only
six
men
up
there
but
the
tatars
had
no
way
of
knowing
just
how
large
a
portion
of
the
whole
clan
that
number
was
travis
pony
lifted
his
head
nickered
and
achieved
a
stumbling
trot
somewhere
ahead
was
water
one
of
those
oases
of
growth
and
life
which
pocked
the
whole
mountain
range
to
the
preservation
of
all
animals
and
all
men
menlik
and
hulagur
pushed
on
until
their
mounts
were
hard
on
the
heels
of
the
two
ridden
by
the
girl
and
travis
travis
wondered
if
they
still
waited
for
some
arrow
to
strike
home
though
he
saw
that
both
men
rode
with
outward
disregard
for
the
patrolling
scouts
a
bush
beckoned
them
on
and
again
the
ponies
quickened
pace
coming
out
into
a
tributary
canyon
which
housed
a
small
pool
and
a
good
stand
of
grass
and
brush
to
one
side
of
the
water
buck
stood
his
arms
folded
across
his
chest
armed
only
with
his
belt
knife
grouped
behind
him
were
deklay
tsoay
nolan
manulito
travis
tabulated
hurriedly
manulito
and
deklay
were
to
be
classed
together
or
had
been
when
he
was
last
in
the
rancheria
on
buck
stairway
from
the
past
both
had
halted
more
than
halfway
down
nolan
was
a
quiet
man
who
seldom
spoke
and
whose
opinion
travis
could
not
foretell
tsoay
would
back
buck
probably
such
a
divided
party
was
the
best
travis
could
have
hoped
to
gather
a
delegation
composed
entirely
of
those
who
were
ready
to
leave
the
past
of
the
redax
a
collection
of
bucks
and
was
outside
the
bounds
of
possibility
but
travis
was
none
too
happy
to
have
deklay
in
on
this
travis
dismounted
letting
the
pony
push
forward
by
himself
to
dip
nose
into
the
pool
this
is
travis
pointed
politely
with
his
chin
menlik
one
who
talks
with
spirits
hulagur
who
is
son
to
a
chief
and
kaydessa
who
is
daughter
to
a
chief
they
are
of
the
horse
people
of
the
north
he
made
the
introduction
carefully
in
english
then
he
turned
to
the
tatars
buck
deklay
nolan
manulito
tsoay
he
named
them
all
these
stand
to
listen
and
to
speak
for
the
apaches
but
sometime
later
when
the
two
parties
sat
facing
each
other
he
wondered
whether
a
common
decision
could
come
from
the
clansmen
on
his
side
of
that
irregular
circle
deklay
expression
was
closed
he
had
even
edged
a
short
way
back
as
if
he
had
no
desire
to
approach
the
strangers
and
travis
read
into
every
line
of
deklay
body
his
distrust
and
antagonism
he
himself
began
to
speak
retelling
his
adventures
since
they
had
followed
kaydessa
trail
sketching
in
the
situation
at
the
settlement
as
he
had
learned
it
from
her
and
from
menlik
he
was
careful
to
speak
in
english
so
that
the
tatars
could
hear
all
he
was
reporting
to
his
own
kind
and
the
apaches
listened
though
tsoay
must
already
have
reported
much
of
this
when
travis
was
done
it
was
deklay
who
asked
a
question
what
have
we
to
do
with
these
people
there
is
this
travis
chose
his
words
carefully
thinking
of
what
might
move
a
warrior
still
conditioned
to
riding
with
the
raiders
of
a
hundred
years
earlier
the
whom
we
call
are
never
willing
to
live
side
by
side
with
any
who
are
not
of
their
mind
and
they
have
weapons
such
as
make
our
bow
cords
bits
of
rotten
string
our
knives
slivers
of
rust
they
do
not
kill
they
enslave
and
when
they
discover
that
we
live
then
they
will
come
against
us
deklay
lips
moved
in
a
wolf
grin
this
is
a
large
land
and
we
know
how
to
use
it
the
will
not
find
us
with
their
eyes
maybe
not
travis
replied
with
their
machines
that
is
another
matter
machines
deklay
spat
always
these
machines
is
that
all
you
can
talk
about
it
would
seem
that
you
are
bewitched
by
these
machines
which
we
have
not
seen
none
of
us
it
was
a
machine
which
brought
you
here
buck
observed
go
you
back
and
look
upon
the
spaceship
and
remember
deklay
the
knowledge
of
the
is
greater
than
ours
when
it
deals
with
metal
and
wire
and
things
which
can
be
made
with
both
machines
brought
us
along
the
road
of
the
stars
and
there
is
no
tracker
in
the
clan
who
could
hope
to
do
the
same
but
now
i
have
this
to
ask
does
our
brother
have
a
plan
those
who
are
reds
travis
answered
slowly
they
do
not
number
many
but
more
may
later
come
from
our
own
world
have
you
heard
of
such
arriving
he
asked
menlik
not
so
but
we
are
not
told
much
we
live
apart
and
no
one
of
us
goes
to
the
ship
unless
he
is
summoned
for
they
have
weapons
to
guard
them
or
long
since
they
would
have
been
dead
it
is
not
proper
for
a
man
to
eat
from
the
pot
ride
in
the
wind
sleep
easy
under
the
same
sky
with
him
who
has
slain
his
brother
they
have
then
killed
among
your
people
they
have
killed
menlik
returned
briefly
kaydessa
stirred
and
muttered
a
word
or
two
to
her
brother
head
came
up
and
he
exploded
into
violent
speech
what
does
he
say
deklay
demanded
the
girl
replied
he
speaks
of
our
father
who
aided
in
the
escape
of
three
and
so
afterward
was
slain
by
the
leader
as
a
lesson
to
us
since
he
was
our
beard
the
khan
we
have
taken
the
oath
in
blood
under
the
wolf
head
standard
that
they
will
also
die
menlik
added
but
first
we
must
shake
them
out
of
their
that
is
the
problem
travis
elaborated
for
the
benefit
of
his
clansmen
we
must
get
these
reds
away
from
their
protected
camp
out
into
the
open
when
they
now
go
they
are
covered
by
this
which
keeps
the
tatars
under
their
control
but
it
has
no
effect
on
us
so
again
i
say
what
is
all
this
to
us
deklay
got
to
his
feet
this
machine
does
not
hunt
us
and
we
can
make
our
camps
in
this
land
where
no
can
find
them
we
are
not
invulnerable
nor
do
we
know
the
full
range
of
machines
they
can
use
it
does
no
one
well
to
say
this
is
not
so
when
he
does
not
know
all
that
lies
in
an
enemy
wickiup
to
travis
relief
he
saw
agreement
mirrored
on
buck
face
tsoay
nolan
from
the
beginning
he
had
had
little
hope
of
swaying
deklay
he
could
only
trust
that
the
verdict
of
the
majority
would
be
the
accepted
one
it
went
back
to
the
old
old
apache
institution
of
prestige
a
had
the
the
high
power
as
a
gift
from
birth
common
men
could
possess
horse
power
or
cattle
power
they
might
have
the
gift
of
acquiring
wealth
so
they
could
make
generous
gifts
be
the
wealthy
ones
who
spoke
for
their
family
groups
within
the
loose
network
of
the
tribe
but
there
was
no
hereditary
chieftainship
or
even
an
undivided
rule
within
a
rancheria
the
or
war
chief
often
led
only
on
the
warpath
and
had
no
voice
in
clan
matters
save
those
dealing
with
a
raid
and
to
have
a
split
now
would
fatally
weaken
their
small
clan
deklay
and
those
of
a
like
mind
might
elect
to
withdraw
and
not
one
of
the
rest
could
deny
him
that
right
we
shall
think
on
this
buck
said
here
is
food
water
pasturage
for
horses
a
camp
for
our
visitors
they
will
wait
here
he
looked
at
travis
you
will
wait
with
them
fox
since
you
know
their
ways
travis
immediate
reaction
was
objection
but
then
he
realized
wisdom
to
offer
the
proposition
of
alliance
to
the
apaches
needed
an
impartial
spokesman
and
if
he
himself
did
it
deklay
might
automatically
oppose
the
idea
let
buck
talk
and
it
would
be
a
statement
of
fact
it
is
well
travis
agreed
buck
looked
about
as
if
judging
time
from
the
lie
of
sun
and
shadow
on
the
ground
we
shall
return
in
the
morning
when
the
shadow
lies
here
with
the
toe
of
his
high
moccasin
he
made
an
impression
in
the
soft
earth
then
without
any
formal
farewell
he
strode
off
the
others
fast
on
his
heels
he
is
your
chief
that
one
kaydessa
asked
pointing
after
buck
he
is
one
having
a
large
voice
in
council
travis
replied
he
set
about
building
up
the
cooking
fire
bringing
out
the
body
of
a
calf
which
had
been
left
them
menlik
sat
on
his
heels
by
the
pool
dipping
up
drinking
water
with
his
hand
now
he
squinted
his
eyes
against
the
probe
of
the
sun
it
will
require
much
talking
to
win
over
the
short
one
he
observed
that
one
does
not
like
us
or
your
plan
just
as
there
will
be
those
among
the
horde
who
will
not
like
it
either
he
flipped
water
drops
from
his
fingers
but
this
i
do
know
man
who
calls
himself
fox
if
we
do
not
make
a
common
cause
then
we
have
no
hope
of
going
against
the
reds
it
will
be
for
them
as
a
man
crushing
fleas
he
brought
his
hand
down
on
his
knee
in
emphatic
slaps
so
and
so
and
so
this
do
i
think
also
travis
admitted
so
let
us
both
hope
that
all
men
will
be
as
wise
as
we
menlik
said
smiling
and
since
we
can
take
a
hand
in
that
decision
this
remains
a
time
for
rest
the
shaman
might
be
content
to
sleep
the
afternoon
away
but
after
he
had
eaten
hulagur
wandered
up
and
down
the
valley
making
a
lengthy
business
of
rubbing
down
their
horses
with
twists
of
last
grass
now
and
then
he
paused
beside
kaydessa
and
spoke
his
uneasiness
plain
to
travis
although
he
could
not
understand
the
words
travis
had
settled
down
in
the
shade
half
dozing
yet
alert
to
every
movement
of
the
three
tatars
he
tried
not
to
think
of
what
might
be
happening
in
the
rancheria
by
switching
his
mind
to
that
misty
valley
of
the
towers
did
any
of
those
three
alien
structures
contain
such
a
grab
bag
of
the
past
as
he
ashe
and
murdock
had
found
on
that
other
world
where
the
winged
people
had
gathered
together
for
them
the
artifacts
of
an
older
civilization
at
that
time
he
had
created
for
their
hosts
a
new
weapon
of
defense
turning
metal
tubes
into
it
had
been
there
too
where
he
had
chanced
upon
the
library
of
tapes
one
of
which
had
eventually
landed
travis
and
his
people
here
on
topaz
even
if
he
did
find
racks
of
such
tapes
in
one
of
those
towers
there
would
be
no
way
of
using
them
with
the
ship
wrecked
on
the
mountain
side
only
travis
fingers
itched
where
they
lay
quiet
on
his
knees
there
might
be
other
things
waiting
if
he
were
only
free
to
explore
he
reached
out
to
touch
menlik
shoulder
the
shaman
half
turned
opening
his
eyes
with
the
languid
effort
of
a
sleepy
cat
but
the
spark
of
intelligence
awoke
in
them
quickly
what
is
it
for
a
moment
travis
hesitated
already
regretting
his
impulse
he
did
not
know
how
much
menlik
remembered
of
the
present
remember
of
the
present
one
part
of
the
apache
mind
was
wryly
amused
at
that
snarled
estimate
of
their
situation
men
who
had
been
dropped
into
their
racial
and
ancestral
pasts
until
the
present
time
was
less
real
than
the
dreams
conditioning
them
had
a
difficult
job
evaluating
any
situation
but
since
menlik
had
clung
to
his
knowledge
of
english
he
must
be
less
far
down
that
stairway
when
we
met
you
kaydessa
and
i
it
was
outside
that
valley
travis
was
still
of
two
minds
about
this
questioning
but
the
tatar
camp
had
been
close
to
the
towers
and
there
was
a
good
chance
the
mongols
had
explored
them
and
inside
were
buildings
very
old
menlik
was
fully
alert
now
he
took
his
wand
played
with
it
as
he
spoke
that
is
or
was
a
place
of
much
power
fox
oh
i
know
that
you
question
my
kinship
with
the
spirits
and
the
powers
they
give
but
one
learns
not
to
dispute
what
one
feels
here
and
here
his
long
somewhat
grimy
fingers
went
to
his
forehead
and
then
to
the
bare
brown
chest
where
his
shirt
fell
open
i
have
walked
the
stone
path
in
that
valley
and
there
have
been
the
whispers
whispers
menlik
twirled
the
wand
whispers
which
are
too
low
for
many
ears
to
distinguish
you
can
hear
them
as
one
hears
the
buzzing
of
an
insect
but
never
the
words
no
never
the
words
but
that
is
a
place
of
great
power
a
place
to
explore
but
menlik
watched
only
his
wand
that
i
wonder
fox
truly
do
i
wonder
this
is
not
our
world
and
here
there
may
be
that
which
does
not
welcome
us
of
a
shaman
or
was
it
true
recognition
of
something
beyond
human
description
travis
could
not
be
sure
but
he
knew
that
he
must
return
to
the
valley
and
see
for
himself
listen
menlik
said
leaning
closer
i
have
heard
your
tale
that
you
were
on
that
first
ship
the
one
which
brought
you
unwilling
along
the
old
star
paths
have
you
ever
seen
such
a
thing
as
this
he
smoothed
a
space
of
soft
earth
and
with
the
narrow
tip
of
his
wand
began
to
draw
whatever
role
menlik
had
played
in
the
present
before
he
had
been
reconditioned
into
a
shaman
of
the
horde
he
had
had
the
ability
of
an
artist
for
with
a
minimum
of
lines
he
created
a
figure
in
that
sketch
it
was
a
man
or
at
least
a
figure
with
general
human
outlines
but
the
round
slightly
oversized
skull
was
bare
the
clothing
skintight
to
reveal
unnaturally
thin
limbs
there
were
large
eyes
small
nose
and
mouth
rather
crowded
into
the
lower
third
of
the
head
giving
an
impression
of
an
brain
case
above
and
it
was
familiar
not
the
flying
men
of
the
other
world
certainly
not
the
nocturnal
yet
for
all
its
alien
quality
travis
was
sure
he
had
seen
its
like
before
he
closed
his
eyes
and
tried
to
visualize
it
apart
from
lines
in
the
soil
such
a
head
white
almost
like
the
bone
of
a
skull
laid
bare
such
a
head
lying
face
down
on
a
arm
clad
in
a
skintight
sleeve
where
had
he
seen
it
the
apache
gave
a
sharp
exclamation
as
he
remembered
fully
the
derelict
spaceship
as
he
had
first
found
it
the
dead
alien
officer
had
still
been
seated
at
its
controls
the
alien
who
had
set
the
tape
which
took
them
out
into
that
forgotten
empire
he
was
the
subject
of
drawing
where
when
did
you
see
such
a
one
the
apache
bent
down
over
the
tatar
menlik
looked
troubled
he
came
into
my
mind
when
i
walked
the
valley
i
thought
i
could
almost
see
such
a
face
in
one
of
the
tower
windows
but
of
that
i
am
not
sure
who
is
it
someone
from
the
old
days
those
who
once
ruled
the
stars
travis
answered
but
were
they
still
here
then
the
remnant
of
a
civilization
which
had
flourished
ten
thousand
years
ago
were
the
baldies
who
centuries
ago
had
hunted
down
so
ruthlessly
the
russians
who
had
dared
to
loot
their
wrecked
ships
still
on
topaz
he
remembered
the
story
of
ross
murdock
escape
from
those
aliens
in
the
far
past
of
europe
and
he
shivered
murdock
was
tough
steel
tough
yet
his
own
description
of
that
epic
chase
and
the
final
meeting
had
carried
with
it
his
terror
what
could
a
handful
of
primitively
armed
and
almost
primitively
minded
terrans
do
now
if
they
had
to
dispute
topaz
with
the
baldies
beyond
this
menlik
worked
his
way
to
the
very
lip
of
a
drop
raising
a
finger
cautiously
beyond
this
we
do
not
go
but
you
say
that
the
camp
of
your
people
lies
well
out
in
the
plains
was
up
on
one
knee
using
the
field
glasses
they
had
brought
from
the
stores
of
the
wrecked
ship
he
passed
them
along
to
travis
there
was
nothing
to
be
sighted
but
the
rippling
amber
waves
of
the
tall
grasses
save
for
an
occasional
break
of
a
copse
of
trees
near
the
foothills
they
had
reached
this
point
in
the
early
morning
threading
through
the
pass
making
their
way
across
the
section
known
to
the
outlaws
from
here
they
could
survey
the
debatable
land
where
their
temporary
allies
insisted
the
reds
were
in
full
control
the
result
of
the
conference
in
the
south
had
been
this
uneasy
alliance
from
the
start
travis
realized
that
he
could
not
hope
to
commit
the
clan
to
any
set
plan
that
even
to
get
this
scouting
party
to
come
against
the
stubborn
resistance
of
deklay
and
his
reactionaries
was
a
major
achievement
there
was
now
an
opening
wedge
of
six
apaches
in
the
north
beyond
this
menlik
repeated
they
keep
watch
and
can
control
us
with
the
caller
what
do
you
think
travis
passed
the
glasses
to
nolan
if
they
were
ever
to
develop
a
war
chief
this
lean
man
tall
for
an
apache
and
slow
to
speak
might
fill
that
role
he
adjusted
the
lenses
and
began
a
detailed
of
the
open
territory
then
he
stiffened
his
mouth
below
the
masking
of
the
glasses
was
tight
what
is
it
asked
riders
two
four
five
also
something
else
in
the
air
menlik
jerked
back
and
grabbed
at
nolan
arm
dragging
him
down
by
the
weight
of
his
body
the
flyer
come
back
back
he
was
still
pulling
at
nolan
prodding
at
travis
with
one
foot
and
the
apaches
stared
at
him
with
amazement
the
shaman
sputtered
in
his
own
language
and
then
visibly
regaining
command
of
himself
spoke
english
once
more
those
are
hunters
and
they
carry
a
caller
either
some
others
have
escaped
or
they
are
determined
to
find
our
mountain
camp
looked
at
travis
you
did
not
feel
anything
when
the
woman
was
under
that
spell
travis
shook
his
head
nodded
and
then
said
to
the
shaman
we
shall
stay
here
and
watch
but
since
it
is
bad
for
you
do
you
go
and
we
shall
meet
you
near
this
place
of
the
towers
agreed
for
a
moment
menlik
face
held
a
shadowy
expression
travis
tried
to
read
was
it
resentment
resentment
that
he
was
forced
to
retreat
when
the
others
could
stand
their
ground
did
the
tatar
believe
that
he
lost
face
this
way
but
the
shaman
gave
a
grunt
of
what
they
took
as
assent
and
slipped
over
the
edge
of
the
lookout
point
a
moment
later
they
heard
him
speaking
the
mongol
tongue
warning
hulagur
and
lotchu
his
companions
on
the
scout
then
came
the
clatter
of
pony
hoofs
as
they
rode
their
mounts
away
the
apaches
settled
back
in
the
cup
which
gave
them
a
wide
view
over
the
plains
soon
it
was
not
necessary
to
use
the
glasses
in
order
to
sight
the
advancing
party
of
hunters
five
riders
four
wearing
tatar
dress
the
fifth
had
such
an
odd
outline
that
travis
was
reminded
of
menlik
sketch
of
the
alien
under
the
sharper
vision
of
the
glasses
he
saw
that
the
rider
was
equipped
with
a
pack
strapped
between
his
shoulders
and
a
bulbous
helmet
covering
most
of
his
head
highly
specialized
equipment
for
communication
travis
guessed
that
is
a
up
above
nolan
said
different
shape
from
ours
they
had
been
familiar
with
helicopters
back
on
terra
ranchers
used
them
for
range
inspection
and
all
of
the
apache
volunteers
had
flown
in
them
but
nolan
was
correct
this
one
possessed
several
unfamiliar
features
the
tatars
say
they
do
bring
those
very
far
into
the
mountains
mused
that
could
explain
their
man
on
horseback
he
gets
in
where
they
do
fly
nolan
fingered
his
bow
if
these
reds
depend
upon
their
machine
to
control
what
they
seek
then
they
may
be
taken
by
surprise
but
not
yet
travis
spoke
sharply
nolan
frowned
at
him
chuckled
the
way
is
not
so
dark
for
us
younger
brother
that
we
need
your
torch
held
for
our
feet
travis
swallowed
back
any
retort
accepting
the
fairness
of
that
rebuke
he
had
no
right
to
believe
that
he
alone
knew
the
best
way
of
handling
the
enemy
biting
on
the
sourness
of
that
realization
he
lay
quietly
with
the
others
watching
the
riders
enter
the
foothills
perhaps
a
quarter
of
a
mile
to
the
west
the
helicopter
was
circling
now
over
the
men
riding
into
a
cut
between
two
rises
when
they
were
lost
to
view
the
pilot
made
wider
casts
and
travis
thought
the
flyer
crew
were
probably
in
communication
with
the
helmeted
one
of
the
quintet
on
the
ground
he
stirred
they
are
heading
for
the
tatar
camp
just
as
if
they
know
exactly
where
it
is
that
also
may
be
true
nolan
replied
what
do
we
know
of
these
tatars
they
have
freely
said
that
the
reds
can
hold
them
in
mind
ropes
when
they
wish
already
they
may
be
so
bound
i
say
let
us
go
back
to
our
own
country
he
added
to
the
decisiveness
of
that
by
handing
the
glasses
and
sliding
down
from
their
perch
travis
looked
at
the
other
in
a
way
he
could
understand
the
wisdom
of
nolan
suggestion
but
he
was
sure
that
withdrawal
now
would
only
postpone
trouble
sooner
or
later
the
apaches
would
have
to
stand
against
the
reds
and
if
they
could
do
it
now
while
the
enemy
was
occupied
with
trouble
from
the
tatars
so
much
the
better
was
following
nolan
but
something
in
travis
rebelled
he
watched
the
circling
helicopter
if
it
was
overhanging
the
action
area
of
the
horsemen
they
had
either
reined
in
or
were
searching
a
relatively
small
section
of
the
foothills
reluctantly
travis
descended
to
the
hollow
where
stood
with
nolan
tsoay
and
lupe
and
rope
were
a
little
to
one
side
as
if
the
final
orders
would
come
from
their
seniors
it
would
be
well
said
slowly
if
we
saw
what
weapons
they
have
i
want
a
closer
look
at
the
equipment
of
that
one
in
the
helmet
also
he
smiled
straight
at
nolan
i
do
not
think
that
they
can
detect
the
presence
of
warriors
of
the
people
unless
we
will
it
so
nolan
ran
a
finger
along
the
curve
of
his
bow
shot
a
measuring
glance
right
and
left
at
the
general
contours
of
the
country
there
is
wisdom
in
what
you
say
elder
brother
only
this
is
a
trail
we
shall
take
alone
not
allowing
the
men
with
fur
hats
to
know
where
we
walk
he
looked
pointedly
in
travis
direction
that
is
wisdom
travis
promptly
replied
giving
nolan
the
old
title
accorded
the
leader
of
a
war
party
travis
was
grateful
for
that
much
of
a
concession
they
swung
into
action
heading
southeast
at
an
angle
which
should
bring
them
across
the
track
of
the
enemy
hunting
party
the
path
was
theirs
at
last
only
moments
after
the
passing
of
their
quarry
none
of
the
five
riders
was
taking
any
precautions
to
cover
his
trail
each
moved
with
the
confidence
of
one
not
having
to
fear
any
attack
from
cover
the
apaches
looked
aloft
they
could
hear
the
faint
hum
of
the
helicopter
it
was
still
circling
tsoay
reported
from
a
higher
check
point
but
those
circles
remained
close
over
the
plains
area
the
riders
had
already
passed
beyond
the
limits
of
that
aerial
sentry
three
to
a
side
the
apaches
advanced
with
the
trail
between
them
they
were
carefully
hidden
when
they
caught
up
with
the
hunters
the
four
tatars
were
grouped
together
the
fifth
man
heavily
burdened
by
his
pack
had
climbed
from
the
saddle
and
was
sitting
on
the
ground
his
hands
busy
with
a
flat
plate
which
covered
him
from
upper
chest
to
belt
now
that
he
had
a
chance
to
see
them
closely
travis
noted
the
lack
of
expression
on
the
broad
tatar
faces
the
four
men
were
blank
of
eye
astride
their
mounts
with
no
apparent
awareness
of
their
present
surroundings
then
as
one
their
heads
swung
around
to
the
helmeted
leader
before
they
dismounted
and
stood
motionless
for
a
long
moment
in
a
way
which
reminded
travis
of
the
coyotes
attitude
when
they
endeavored
to
pass
some
message
to
him
but
these
men
even
lacked
the
signs
of
thinking
intelligence
the
animals
had
the
helmeted
man
hand
moved
across
his
chest
plate
and
instantly
his
followers
came
into
a
measure
of
life
one
put
his
hand
to
his
forehead
with
an
odd
gesture
another
half
crouched
his
lips
wrinkling
back
in
a
snarl
and
the
leader
watching
him
laughed
then
he
snapped
an
order
his
hand
poised
over
his
control
plate
one
of
the
four
took
the
horse
reins
made
the
mounts
fast
to
bushes
then
as
one
they
began
to
walk
forward
the
red
bringing
up
the
rear
several
paces
behind
the
nearest
tatar
they
were
going
upslope
to
the
crest
of
a
small
ridge
the
tatar
who
first
reached
the
crest
put
his
hands
to
cup
his
mouth
sent
a
ringing
cry
southward
and
the
faint
echoed
on
and
on
through
the
hills
either
menlik
had
reached
the
camp
in
time
or
his
people
were
not
to
be
so
easily
enticed
for
though
the
hunters
waited
for
a
long
time
there
was
no
answer
to
that
hail
at
last
the
helmeted
man
called
his
captives
bringing
them
sullenly
down
to
mount
and
ride
again
a
move
which
suited
the
apaches
they
could
not
tell
how
close
was
the
communication
between
the
rider
and
the
helicopter
and
they
were
still
too
near
the
plains
to
attack
unless
it
was
necessary
for
their
own
protection
travis
dropped
back
to
join
nolan
he
controls
them
by
that
plate
on
his
chest
he
said
if
we
would
take
them
we
must
get
at
that
these
tatars
use
lariats
in
fighting
did
they
not
rope
you
as
a
calf
is
roped
for
branding
then
why
do
they
not
so
take
this
red
binding
his
arms
to
his
sides
the
suspicion
in
nolan
voice
was
plain
perhaps
in
them
is
some
conditioned
control
making
it
so
that
they
can
not
attack
their
rulers
i
do
not
like
this
matter
of
machines
which
can
play
this
way
and
that
with
minds
and
bodies
flared
nolan
a
man
should
only
a
weapon
not
be
one
travis
could
agree
to
that
had
they
by
the
wreck
of
their
own
ship
and
the
death
of
ruthven
escaped
just
such
an
existence
as
these
tatars
now
endured
if
so
why
he
and
all
the
apaches
were
volunteers
eager
and
willing
to
form
new
world
colonies
what
had
happened
back
on
terra
that
they
had
been
so
ruthlessly
sent
out
without
warning
and
under
redax
another
small
piece
of
that
puzzle
or
maybe
the
heart
of
the
whole
picture
snapped
into
place
had
the
project
learned
in
some
way
of
the
tatar
settlement
on
topaz
and
so
been
forced
to
speed
up
that
translation
from
late
americans
to
primitives
that
would
explain
a
lot
travis
returned
abruptly
to
the
matter
now
at
hand
as
he
saw
a
peak
ahead
the
party
they
were
trailing
was
heading
directly
for
the
outlaw
travis
hoped
menlik
had
warned
them
in
time
there
that
wall
of
cliff
to
his
left
must
shelter
the
valley
of
the
towers
though
it
was
still
miles
ahead
travis
did
not
believe
the
hunters
would
be
able
to
reach
their
goal
unless
they
traveled
at
night
they
might
not
know
of
the
which
could
menace
the
dark
but
the
enemy
whether
he
knew
of
such
dangers
or
not
did
not
intend
to
press
on
as
the
sun
pulled
away
leaving
crevices
and
crannies
shadow
dark
the
hunters
stopped
to
make
camp
the
apaches
after
their
custom
on
the
war
trail
gathered
on
the
heights
above
this
red
seems
to
think
that
he
shall
find
those
he
seeks
sitting
waiting
for
him
as
if
their
feet
were
nipped
tight
in
a
trap
tsoay
remarked
it
is
the
habit
of
the
lupe
added
to
believe
they
are
greater
than
all
others
yet
this
one
is
a
stupid
fool
walking
into
the
arms
of
a
with
a
cub
he
chuckled
a
man
with
a
rifle
does
not
fear
a
man
armed
only
with
a
stick
travis
cut
in
quickly
this
one
is
armed
with
a
weapon
which
he
has
good
reason
to
believe
makes
him
invulnerable
to
attack
if
he
rests
tonight
he
probably
leaves
his
machine
on
guard
at
least
we
are
sure
of
one
thing
nolan
said
in
half
agreement
this
one
does
not
suspect
that
there
are
any
in
these
hills
save
those
he
can
master
and
his
machine
does
not
work
against
us
thus
at
dawn
he
made
a
swift
gesture
and
they
smiled
in
concert
at
dawn
the
old
time
of
attack
an
apache
does
not
attack
at
night
travis
was
not
sure
that
any
of
them
could
break
that
old
taboo
and
creep
down
upon
the
camp
before
the
coming
of
new
light
but
tomorrow
morning
they
would
take
over
this
confident
red
strip
him
of
his
enslaving
machine
travis
head
jerked
it
had
come
as
suddenly
as
a
blow
between
his
eyes
to
half
stun
him
what
what
was
it
not
any
physical
impact
no
something
which
was
dazing
but
still
immaterial
he
braced
his
whole
body
awaiting
its
return
trying
frantically
to
understand
what
had
happened
in
that
instant
of
vertigo
and
seeming
disembodiment
never
had
he
experienced
anything
like
it
or
had
he
two
years
or
more
ago
when
he
had
gone
through
the
time
transfer
to
enter
the
arizona
of
the
folsom
men
some
ten
thousand
years
earlier
that
moment
of
transfer
had
been
something
like
this
a
sensation
of
being
awry
in
space
and
time
with
no
stable
footing
to
be
found
yet
he
was
lying
here
on
very
tangible
rock
and
soil
and
nothing
about
him
in
the
landscape
of
topaz
had
changed
in
the
slightest
but
that
blow
had
left
behind
it
a
quivering
residue
of
panic
buried
far
inside
him
a
tender
spot
like
an
open
wound
travis
drew
a
deep
breath
which
was
almost
a
sob
levered
himself
up
on
one
elbow
to
stare
intently
down
into
the
enemy
camp
was
this
some
attack
from
the
other
unknown
weapon
suddenly
he
was
not
at
all
sure
what
might
happen
when
the
apaches
made
that
dawn
rush
was
in
station
on
his
right
travis
must
compare
notes
with
him
to
be
sure
that
this
was
not
indeed
a
trap
better
to
retreat
now
than
to
be
taken
like
fish
in
a
net
he
crept
out
of
his
place
gave
the
chittering
signal
call
of
the
and
heard
answer
in
a
cleverly
mimicked
trill
of
a
night
insect
did
you
feel
something
just
now
in
your
head
travis
found
it
difficult
to
put
that
sensation
into
words
not
so
but
you
did
he
had
of
course
he
had
the
remains
of
it
were
still
in
him
that
point
of
panic
yes
the
machine
i
do
know
travis
confusion
grew
it
might
be
that
he
alone
of
the
party
had
been
struck
if
so
he
could
be
a
danger
to
his
own
kind
this
is
not
good
i
think
we
had
better
hold
council
away
from
here
whisper
was
the
merest
ghost
of
sound
he
chirped
again
to
be
answered
from
tsoay
upslope
who
passed
on
the
signal
the
first
moon
was
high
in
the
sky
as
the
apaches
gathered
together
again
travis
asked
his
question
had
any
of
the
others
felt
that
odd
blow
he
was
met
by
negatives
but
nolan
had
the
final
word
this
is
not
good
he
echoed
comment
if
it
was
the
red
machine
at
work
then
we
may
all
be
swept
into
his
net
along
with
those
he
seeks
perhaps
the
longer
one
remains
close
to
that
thing
the
more
influence
it
gains
over
him
we
shall
stay
here
until
dawn
if
the
enemy
would
reach
the
place
they
seek
then
they
must
pass
below
us
for
that
is
the
easiest
road
burdened
with
his
machine
that
red
has
ever
taken
the
easiest
way
so
we
shall
see
if
he
also
has
a
defense
against
these
when
they
come
without
warning
he
touched
the
arrows
in
his
quiver
to
kill
from
ambush
meant
that
they
might
never
learn
the
secret
of
the
machine
but
after
his
experience
travis
was
willing
to
admit
that
nolan
caution
was
the
wise
way
travis
wanted
no
part
of
a
second
attack
like
that
which
had
shaken
him
so
and
nolan
had
not
ordered
a
general
retreat
it
must
be
in
the
war
chief
thoughts
as
it
was
in
travis
that
if
the
machine
could
have
an
influence
over
apaches
it
must
cease
to
function
they
set
their
ambush
with
the
skill
the
redax
had
grafted
into
their
memories
then
there
was
nothing
to
do
but
wait
it
was
an
hour
after
dawn
when
tsoay
signaled
that
the
enemy
was
coming
and
shortly
after
they
heard
the
thud
of
ponies
hoofs
the
first
tatar
plodded
into
view
and
by
the
stance
of
his
body
in
the
saddle
travis
knew
the
red
had
him
under
full
control
two
then
three
tatars
passed
between
the
teeth
of
the
apache
trap
the
fourth
one
had
allowed
a
wider
gap
to
open
between
himself
and
his
fellows
then
the
red
leader
came
his
face
below
the
bulge
of
the
helmet
was
not
happy
travis
believed
the
man
was
not
a
horseman
by
inclination
the
apache
set
arrow
to
bow
cord
and
at
the
chirp
from
nolan
fired
in
concert
with
his
clansmen
only
one
of
those
arrows
found
a
target
the
red
pony
gave
a
shrill
scream
of
pain
and
terror
reared
pawing
at
the
air
toppled
back
pinning
its
shouting
rider
under
it
the
red
had
had
a
defense
right
enough
one
which
had
somehow
deflected
the
arrows
but
he
neither
had
protection
against
his
own
awkward
seat
in
the
saddle
nor
the
arrow
which
had
seriously
wounded
the
now
threshing
pony
ahead
the
tatars
twisted
and
writhed
mouthed
tortured
cries
then
dropped
out
of
their
saddles
to
lie
limply
on
the
ground
as
if
the
arrows
aimed
at
the
master
had
instead
struck
each
to
the
heart
either
the
red
was
lucky
or
his
reactions
were
quick
he
had
somehow
rolled
clear
of
the
struggling
horse
as
lupe
leaped
from
behind
a
boulder
knife
out
and
ready
to
the
eyes
of
the
apaches
the
helmeted
man
lay
easy
prey
to
lupe
attack
nor
did
he
raise
an
arm
to
defend
himself
though
one
hand
lay
free
across
the
plate
on
his
chest
but
the
young
apache
stumbled
rebounding
back
as
if
he
had
run
into
an
unseen
wall
when
his
knife
was
still
six
inches
away
from
the
other
lupe
cried
out
shook
under
a
second
impact
as
the
red
fired
an
automatic
with
his
other
hand
travis
dropped
his
bow
returned
to
the
most
primitive
weapon
of
all
his
hand
closed
around
a
stone
and
he
hurled
the
oval
straight
at
the
helmet
so
clearly
outlined
against
the
rocks
below
but
even
as
lupe
knife
had
never
touched
flesh
so
was
the
rock
deflected
the
red
was
covered
by
some
protective
field
this
was
certainly
nothing
the
apaches
had
seen
before
nolan
whistle
summoned
them
to
draw
back
the
red
fired
again
the
sharp
bark
of
the
hand
gun
harsh
and
loud
he
did
not
have
any
real
target
for
with
the
exception
of
lupe
the
apaches
had
gone
to
earth
between
the
rocks
the
red
was
struggling
to
his
feet
but
he
moved
slowly
favoring
his
side
and
one
leg
he
had
not
come
totally
unharmed
from
his
tumble
with
the
pony
an
armed
enemy
who
could
not
be
touched
one
who
knew
there
were
more
than
outlaws
in
this
region
the
red
leader
was
far
more
of
a
threat
to
the
apaches
now
than
he
had
ever
been
he
must
not
be
allowed
to
escape
he
was
holstering
his
gun
moving
along
with
one
hand
against
the
rocks
to
steady
himself
trying
to
reach
one
of
the
ponies
that
stood
with
trailing
reins
beside
the
inert
tatars
but
when
the
enemy
reached
the
far
side
of
that
rock
he
would
have
to
sacrifice
either
his
steadying
hold
or
his
touch
on
the
chest
plate
where
his
other
hand
rested
would
he
then
for
an
instant
be
vulnerable
the
pony
travis
put
an
arrow
on
bow
cord
and
shot
not
at
the
red
who
had
released
his
hold
of
the
rock
preferring
to
totter
instead
of
lose
control
of
the
chest
plate
but
into
the
air
straight
before
the
nose
of
the
mount
the
pony
neighed
wildly
tried
to
turn
and
its
shoulder
caught
the
free
groping
hand
of
the
red
and
spun
the
man
around
and
back
so
that
he
flung
up
both
hands
in
an
effort
to
ward
himself
off
the
rocks
then
the
pony
stampeded
down
the
break
its
companions
catching
the
same
fever
trailing
in
a
mad
dash
which
kept
the
red
hard
against
the
boulders
he
continued
to
stand
there
until
the
horses
save
for
the
wounded
one
still
kicking
fruitlessly
were
gone
travis
felt
a
sense
of
reprieve
they
might
not
be
able
to
get
at
the
red
but
he
was
hurt
and
afoot
two
strikes
which
might
yet
reduce
him
to
a
condition
the
apaches
could
handle
apparently
the
other
was
also
aware
of
that
for
now
he
pushed
out
from
the
rocks
and
stumbled
along
after
the
ponies
but
he
went
only
a
step
or
two
then
settling
back
once
more
against
a
convenient
boulder
he
began
to
work
at
the
plate
on
his
chest
nolan
appeared
noiselessly
beside
travis
what
does
he
do
his
lips
were
very
close
to
the
younger
man
ear
his
voice
hardly
more
than
a
breath
travis
shook
his
head
slightly
the
red
actions
were
a
complete
mystery
unless
now
disabled
and
afoot
he
was
trying
to
summon
aid
though
there
was
no
landing
place
for
a
helicopter
here
now
was
the
time
to
try
and
reach
lupe
travis
had
seen
a
slight
movement
in
the
fallen
apache
hand
the
first
indication
that
the
enemy
shot
had
not
been
as
fatal
as
it
had
looked
he
touched
arm
pointed
to
lupe
and
then
discarding
his
bow
and
quiver
beside
the
war
leader
he
stripped
for
action
there
was
cover
down
to
the
wounded
apache
which
would
aid
him
he
must
pass
one
of
the
tatars
on
the
way
but
none
of
the
tribesmen
had
shown
any
signs
of
life
since
they
had
fallen
from
their
saddles
at
the
first
attack
with
infinite
care
travis
lowered
himself
into
a
narrow
passage
took
a
lizard
way
between
brush
and
boulder
pausing
only
when
he
reached
the
tatar
for
a
quick
check
on
the
potential
enemy
the
lean
brown
face
was
half
turned
one
cheek
in
the
sand
but
the
slack
mouth
the
closed
eyes
were
those
travis
believed
of
a
dead
man
by
some
action
of
his
diabolic
machine
the
red
must
have
snuffed
out
his
four
captives
perhaps
in
the
belief
that
they
were
part
of
the
apache
attack
travis
reached
the
rock
where
lupe
lay
he
knew
that
nolan
was
watching
the
red
and
would
give
him
warning
if
he
suddenly
showed
an
interest
in
anything
but
his
machine
the
apache
reached
out
his
hands
closing
on
lupe
ankles
beneath
his
touch
flesh
and
muscle
tensed
lupe
eyes
were
open
focused
now
on
travis
there
was
a
bleeding
furrow
above
his
right
ear
the
red
had
tried
a
difficult
head
shot
failing
in
his
aim
by
a
mere
fraction
of
an
inch
lupe
made
a
swift
move
for
which
travis
was
ready
his
grip
on
the
other
body
helped
to
tumble
them
both
around
a
rock
which
lay
between
them
and
the
red
there
was
the
crack
of
another
shot
and
dust
spurted
from
the
side
of
the
boulder
but
they
lay
together
safe
for
the
present
as
travis
was
sure
the
enemy
would
not
risk
an
open
attack
on
their
small
fortress
with
travis
aid
lupe
struggled
back
up
to
the
site
where
nolan
waited
was
there
to
make
competent
examination
of
the
boy
wound
creased
he
reported
a
sore
head
but
no
great
damage
perhaps
a
scar
later
warrior
he
gave
lupe
an
encouraging
thump
on
the
shoulder
before
plastering
an
aid
pack
over
the
cut
now
we
go
nolan
spoke
with
emphatic
decision
he
saw
enough
of
us
to
know
we
are
not
tatars
nolan
eyes
were
cold
his
mouth
grim
as
he
faced
travis
and
how
can
we
fight
him
there
is
a
wall
a
wall
you
can
not
see
about
him
lupe
broke
in
when
i
would
strike
at
him
i
could
not
a
man
with
invisible
protection
and
a
gun
took
up
the
argument
how
would
you
deal
with
him
younger
brother
i
do
know
travis
admitted
yet
he
also
believed
that
if
they
withdrew
left
the
red
here
to
be
found
by
his
own
people
the
enemy
would
immediately
begin
an
investigation
of
the
southern
country
perhaps
pushed
by
their
need
for
learning
more
about
the
apaches
they
would
bring
the
helicopter
in
over
the
mountains
the
answer
to
all
apache
dangers
for
now
lay
in
the
immediate
future
of
this
one
man
he
is
hurt
he
can
not
go
far
on
foot
and
even
if
he
calls
the
there
is
no
landing
place
he
will
have
to
move
elsewhere
to
be
picked
up
travis
thought
aloud
citing
the
thin
handful
of
points
in
their
favor
tsoay
nodded
toward
the
rim
of
the
ravine
rocks
up
there
and
rocks
can
roll
start
an
earthslide
something
within
travis
balked
at
that
from
the
first
he
had
been
willing
enough
to
slug
it
out
with
the
red
weapon
to
weapon
man
to
man
also
he
had
wanted
to
take
a
captive
not
stand
over
a
body
but
to
use
the
nature
of
the
country
against
the
enemy
that
was
the
oldest
apache
trick
of
all
and
one
they
would
have
to
be
forced
to
employ
nolan
had
already
nodded
in
assent
and
tsoay
and
started
off
even
if
the
red
did
possess
a
protective
wall
device
could
it
operate
in
full
against
a
landslide
they
all
doubted
that
the
apaches
reached
the
cliff
rim
without
exposing
themselves
to
the
enemy
fire
the
red
still
sat
there
calmly
his
back
against
the
rock
his
hands
busy
with
his
equipment
as
if
he
had
all
the
time
in
the
world
then
suddenly
came
a
scream
from
more
than
one
throat
the
ancient
war
cry
of
the
mongol
hordes
then
over
the
lip
of
the
other
slope
rose
a
wave
of
men
their
curved
swords
out
a
glazed
set
to
their
eyes
heading
for
the
amerindians
with
utter
disregard
for
any
personal
safety
menlik
in
the
lead
his
shaman
robe
flapping
wide
below
his
belt
like
the
wings
of
some
oversized
predatory
bird
hulagur
jagatai
men
from
the
camp
and
they
were
not
striving
to
destroy
their
disabled
overlord
in
the
vale
below
but
to
wipe
out
the
apaches
only
the
fact
that
the
apaches
were
already
sheltered
behind
the
rocks
they
were
laboring
to
dislodge
gave
them
a
precious
few
moments
of
grace
there
was
no
time
to
use
their
bows
they
could
only
use
knives
to
meet
the
swords
of
the
tatars
knives
and
the
fact
that
they
could
fight
with
unclouded
minds
he
has
them
under
control
travis
pawed
at
shoulder
get
him
they
stop
he
did
not
wait
to
see
if
the
other
apache
understood
instead
he
threw
the
full
force
of
his
own
body
against
the
rock
they
had
made
the
center
stone
of
their
slide
it
gave
rolled
carrying
with
it
and
before
it
the
rest
of
the
piled
rubble
travis
stumbled
fell
flat
and
then
a
body
thudded
down
upon
him
and
he
was
fighting
for
his
life
to
keep
a
blade
from
his
throat
around
him
were
the
shouts
and
cries
of
embroiled
warriors
then
all
was
silenced
by
a
roar
from
below
glazed
eyes
in
a
face
only
a
foot
from
his
own
the
twisted
panting
mouth
sending
gusts
of
breath
into
his
nostrils
suddenly
there
was
reason
back
in
those
eyes
a
bewilderment
which
became
fear
panic
the
tatar
body
twisted
in
travis
hold
striving
now
not
to
attack
but
to
win
free
as
the
apache
loosened
his
grip
the
other
jerked
away
so
that
for
a
moment
or
two
they
lay
gasping
side
by
side
men
sat
up
to
look
at
men
there
was
a
spreading
stain
down
side
and
one
of
the
tatars
sprawled
near
him
both
his
hands
on
his
chest
coughing
violently
menlik
clawed
at
the
trunk
of
a
mountain
tree
pulled
himself
to
his
feet
and
stood
swaying
as
might
a
man
long
ill
and
recovering
from
severe
exertion
insensibly
both
sides
drew
apart
leaving
a
space
between
tatar
and
apache
the
faces
of
the
amerindians
were
grim
those
of
the
mongols
bewildered
and
then
harsh
as
they
eyed
their
late
opponents
with
dawning
reason
what
had
begun
in
compulsion
for
the
tatars
might
well
flare
now
into
rational
combat
and
from
that
to
a
campaign
of
extermination
travis
was
on
his
feet
he
looked
over
the
lip
of
the
drop
the
red
was
still
in
his
place
down
there
a
pile
of
rubble
about
him
his
protection
must
have
failed
for
his
head
was
back
at
an
unnatural
angle
and
the
dent
in
his
helmet
could
be
easily
seen
that
one
is
dead
or
helpless
travis
cried
out
do
you
still
wish
to
fight
for
him
shaman
menlik
came
away
from
the
tree
and
walked
to
the
edge
of
the
drop
the
others
too
were
moving
forward
after
the
shaman
looked
down
he
stooped
picked
up
a
small
stone
and
flung
it
at
the
motionless
red
there
was
a
crack
of
sound
they
all
saw
the
tiny
spurt
of
flame
a
curl
of
smoke
from
the
plate
on
the
red
chest
not
only
the
man
but
his
control
was
finished
now
a
wolfish
growl
and
two
of
the
tatars
swung
over
started
down
to
the
red
menlik
shouted
and
they
slackened
pace
we
want
that
he
cried
in
english
perhaps
so
we
can
learn
the
learning
is
yours
replied
just
as
this
land
is
yours
shaman
but
i
warn
you
from
this
day
do
not
ride
south
menlik
turned
the
charms
on
his
belt
clicking
so
that
is
the
way
it
is
to
be
apache
that
is
the
way
it
shall
be
tatar
we
do
not
ride
to
war
with
allies
who
may
turn
their
knives
against
our
backs
because
they
are
slaves
to
a
machine
the
enemy
controls
the
tatar
long
hands
opened
and
closed
you
are
a
wise
man
apache
but
sometimes
more
than
wisdom
alone
is
needed
we
are
wise
men
shaman
let
it
rest
there
replied
somberly
already
the
apaches
were
on
their
way
putting
two
cliff
ridges
behind
them
before
they
halted
to
examine
and
cover
their
wounds
we
go
nolan
chin
lifted
indicating
the
southern
route
here
we
do
not
come
again
there
is
too
much
witchcraft
in
this
place
travis
stirred
saw
that
was
frowning
at
him
go
he
repeated
yes
younger
brother
you
would
continue
to
run
with
these
who
are
governed
by
a
machine
no
only
eyes
are
needed
on
this
side
of
the
mountains
why
this
time
was
plainly
on
the
side
of
the
conservatives
we
have
now
seen
this
machine
at
work
it
is
fortunate
that
the
red
is
dead
he
will
carry
no
tales
of
us
back
to
his
people
as
you
feared
thus
if
we
remain
south
from
now
on
we
are
safe
and
this
fight
between
tatar
and
red
is
none
of
ours
what
do
you
seek
here
i
must
go
again
to
the
place
of
the
towers
travis
answered
with
the
truth
but
his
friends
were
facing
him
with
heavy
disapproval
now
a
full
row
of
deklays
did
you
not
tell
us
that
you
felt
this
strange
thing
during
the
night
we
waited
about
the
camp
what
if
you
become
one
with
these
tatars
and
are
also
controlled
by
the
machine
then
you
too
can
be
made
into
a
weapon
against
us
your
clansmen
was
almost
openly
hostile
sense
was
on
his
side
but
in
travis
was
this
other
desire
of
which
he
was
becoming
more
conscious
by
the
minute
there
was
a
reason
for
those
towers
perhaps
a
reason
important
enough
for
him
to
discover
and
run
the
risk
of
angering
his
own
people
there
may
be
this
nolan
voice
was
remote
and
cold
you
may
already
be
a
piece
of
this
thing
bound
to
the
machines
if
so
we
do
not
want
you
among
us
there
it
was
an
open
hostility
with
more
power
behind
it
than
motiveless
disapproval
had
carried
travis
was
troubled
the
family
the
clan
they
were
important
if
he
took
the
wrong
step
now
and
was
outlawed
from
that
tight
fortress
then
as
an
apache
he
would
indeed
be
a
lost
man
in
the
past
of
his
people
there
had
been
renegades
from
the
tribe
men
such
as
the
infamous
apache
kid
who
had
killed
and
killed
again
not
only
white
men
but
his
own
people
wolf
men
living
lives
in
the
hills
travis
was
threatened
with
that
yet
up
the
ladder
of
civilization
down
the
ladder
why
did
this
feverish
curiosity
ride
him
so
cruelly
now
listen
his
side
padded
with
bandages
stepped
closer
and
tell
me
younger
brother
what
is
it
that
you
seek
in
these
towers
on
another
world
there
were
secrets
of
the
old
ones
to
be
found
in
such
ancient
buildings
here
that
might
also
be
true
and
among
the
secrets
of
those
old
ones
nolan
voice
was
still
harsh
were
those
which
brought
us
to
this
world
is
that
not
so
did
any
man
drive
you
nolan
or
you
tsoay
or
you
or
any
of
us
to
promise
to
go
beyond
the
stars
you
were
told
what
might
be
done
and
you
were
eager
to
try
it
you
were
all
volunteers
save
for
this
voyage
when
we
were
told
nothing
answered
cutting
straight
to
the
heart
of
the
matter
yet
nolan
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
for
more
voyage
tapes
that
our
younger
brother
now
searches
nor
would
those
do
us
any
good
as
our
ship
will
not
rise
again
from
here
what
is
it
that
you
do
seek
knowledge
weapons
maybe
can
we
stand
against
these
machines
of
the
reds
yet
many
of
the
devices
they
now
use
are
taken
from
the
star
ships
they
have
looted
through
time
to
every
weapon
there
is
a
defense
nolan
blinked
and
for
the
first
time
a
hint
of
interest
touched
the
mask
of
his
face
to
the
bow
the
rifle
he
said
softly
to
the
rifle
the
machine
gun
to
the
cannon
the
big
bomb
the
defense
can
be
far
worse
than
the
first
weapon
so
you
think
that
in
these
towers
there
may
be
things
which
shall
be
to
the
reds
machines
as
the
bomb
is
to
the
cannon
of
the
horse
soldiers
travis
had
an
inspiration
did
not
our
people
lay
aside
the
bow
for
the
rifle
when
we
went
up
against
the
bluecoats
we
do
not
so
go
up
against
these
reds
protested
lupe
not
now
but
what
if
they
come
across
the
mountains
perhaps
driving
the
tatars
before
them
to
do
their
fighting
and
you
believe
that
if
you
find
weapons
in
these
towers
you
will
know
how
to
use
them
asked
what
will
give
you
that
knowledge
younger
brother
i
do
not
claim
such
knowledge
travis
countered
but
this
much
i
do
have
once
i
studied
to
be
an
archaeologist
and
i
have
seen
other
storehouses
of
these
star
people
who
else
among
us
can
say
as
much
as
that
that
is
the
truth
acknowledged
also
there
is
good
sense
in
this
seeking
out
of
the
tower
things
let
the
reds
find
such
first
if
they
exist
at
all
and
then
we
may
truly
be
caught
in
a
box
canyon
with
only
death
at
our
heels
and
you
would
go
to
these
towers
now
nolan
demanded
i
can
cut
across
country
and
then
rejoin
you
on
the
other
side
of
the
pass
the
feeling
of
urgency
which
had
been
mounting
in
travis
was
now
so
demanding
that
he
wanted
to
race
ahead
through
the
wilderness
he
was
surprised
when
put
out
his
palm
up
as
if
to
warn
the
younger
man
take
care
younger
brother
this
is
not
a
lucky
business
and
remember
if
one
goes
too
far
down
a
wrong
trail
there
is
sometimes
no
returning
we
shall
wait
on
the
other
side
of
the
pass
for
one
day
nolan
added
then
he
shrugged
where
you
go
will
be
your
own
affair
travis
did
not
understand
that
promise
of
trouble
he
was
already
two
steps
down
his
chosen
path
travis
had
taken
a
direct
cross
route
through
the
heights
but
not
swiftly
enough
to
reach
his
objective
before
nightfall
and
he
had
no
wish
to
enter
the
tower
valley
by
moonlight
in
him
two
emotions
now
warred
there
was
the
urge
to
invade
the
towers
to
discover
their
secret
and
flaring
higher
and
higher
the
beginnings
of
a
new
fear
was
he
now
a
battlefield
for
the
superstitions
of
his
race
reborn
by
the
redax
and
his
modern
education
in
the
world
half
apache
brave
of
the
past
half
modern
archaeologist
with
a
thirst
for
knowledge
or
was
the
fear
rooted
more
deeply
and
for
another
reason
travis
crouched
in
a
hollow
trying
to
understand
what
he
felt
why
was
it
suddenly
so
overwhelmingly
important
for
him
to
investigate
the
towers
if
he
only
had
the
coyotes
with
him
why
and
where
had
they
gone
he
was
alive
to
every
noise
out
of
the
night
every
scent
the
wind
carried
to
him
the
night
had
its
own
life
just
as
the
daylight
hours
held
theirs
only
a
few
of
those
sounds
could
he
identify
even
less
did
he
see
there
was
one
huge
flying
thing
which
passed
across
the
plate
of
the
nearer
moon
it
was
so
large
that
for
an
instant
travis
believed
the
helicopter
had
come
then
the
wings
flapped
breaking
the
glide
and
the
creature
merged
in
the
shadows
of
the
night
a
hunter
large
enough
to
be
a
serious
threat
and
one
he
had
never
seen
before
relying
on
his
own
small
defense
the
strewing
of
brittle
sticks
along
the
only
approach
to
the
hollow
travis
dozed
at
intervals
his
head
down
on
his
forearm
across
his
bent
knees
but
the
cold
cramped
him
and
he
was
glad
to
see
the
graying
sky
of
he
swallowed
two
ration
tablets
and
a
couple
of
mouthfuls
of
water
from
his
canteen
and
started
on
by
sunup
he
had
reached
the
ledge
of
the
waterfall
and
he
hurried
along
the
ancient
road
at
a
pace
which
increased
to
a
run
the
closer
he
drew
to
the
valley
deliberately
he
slowed
his
native
caution
now
in
control
so
that
he
was
walking
as
he
passed
through
the
gateway
into
the
swirling
mists
which
alternately
exposed
and
veiled
the
towers
there
was
no
change
in
the
scene
from
the
time
he
had
come
there
with
kaydessa
but
now
rising
from
a
comfortable
sprawl
on
the
pavement
was
a
welcoming
committee
and
naginlta
showing
no
more
excitement
at
his
coming
than
if
they
had
parted
only
moments
before
travis
went
down
on
one
knee
holding
out
his
hand
to
the
female
who
had
always
been
the
more
friendly
she
advanced
a
step
or
two
touched
a
cold
nose
to
his
knuckles
and
whined
why
he
voiced
that
one
word
but
behind
it
was
a
long
list
of
questions
why
had
they
left
him
why
were
they
here
where
there
was
no
hunting
why
did
they
meet
him
now
as
if
they
had
calmly
expected
his
return
travis
glanced
from
the
animals
to
the
towers
those
windows
set
in
diamond
pattern
and
again
he
was
visited
by
the
impression
that
he
was
under
observation
with
the
mist
floating
across
those
openings
it
would
be
easy
for
a
lurker
to
watch
him
unseen
he
walked
slowly
on
into
the
valley
his
moccasins
making
no
sound
on
the
pavement
but
he
could
hear
the
faint
click
of
the
coyotes
claws
as
they
paced
beside
him
on
each
hand
the
sun
did
not
penetrate
here
making
merely
a
gilt
fog
of
the
mist
as
he
approached
within
touching
distance
of
the
first
tower
it
seemed
to
travis
that
the
mist
was
curling
about
him
he
could
no
longer
see
the
archway
through
which
he
had
entered
the
valley
slayer
of
monsters
give
strength
to
the
bow
arm
to
the
knife
wrist
out
of
what
memory
did
that
ancient
plea
come
travis
was
hardly
aware
of
the
sense
of
the
words
until
he
spoke
them
aloud
you
who
wait
inday
an
apache
is
not
food
for
you
i
am
fox
of
the
the
eagle
people
and
beside
me
walk
of
power
travis
blinked
and
shook
his
head
as
one
waking
why
had
he
spoken
so
using
words
and
phrases
which
were
not
part
of
any
modern
speech
he
moved
on
around
the
base
of
the
first
tower
to
find
no
door
no
break
in
its
surface
below
the
windows
to
the
next
structure
and
the
next
until
he
had
encircled
all
three
if
he
were
to
enter
any
he
must
find
a
way
of
reaching
the
lowest
windows
on
he
went
to
the
other
opening
of
the
valley
the
one
which
gave
upon
the
territory
of
the
tatar
camp
but
he
did
not
sight
any
of
the
mongols
as
he
hacked
down
a
sapling
trimmed
and
smoothed
it
into
a
lance
his
torn
into
even
strips
and
knotted
together
gave
him
a
rope
which
he
judged
would
be
barely
long
enough
for
his
purpose
then
travis
made
a
chancy
cast
for
the
lower
window
of
the
nearest
tower
on
the
second
try
the
lance
slipped
in
and
he
gave
a
quick
jerk
jamming
the
lance
as
a
bar
across
the
opening
it
was
a
frail
ladder
but
the
best
he
could
improvise
he
climbed
until
the
sill
of
the
window
was
within
reach
and
he
could
pull
himself
up
and
over
the
sill
was
a
wide
one
at
least
a
span
between
the
inner
and
outer
surface
of
the
tower
travis
sat
there
for
a
minute
reluctant
to
enter
near
the
end
of
his
dangling
the
two
coyotes
lay
on
the
pavement
their
heads
up
their
tongues
lolling
from
their
mouths
their
expressions
ones
of
detached
interest
perhaps
it
was
the
width
of
the
outer
wall
that
subdued
the
amount
of
light
in
the
room
the
chamber
was
circular
and
directly
opposite
him
was
a
second
window
the
lowest
of
the
matching
diamond
pattern
he
took
the
drop
from
the
sill
to
the
floor
but
lingered
in
the
light
as
he
surveyed
every
inch
of
the
room
there
were
no
furnishings
at
all
but
in
the
very
center
sank
a
well
of
darkness
a
smooth
pillar
glowing
faintly
rose
from
its
core
travis
adjusting
eyes
noted
how
the
light
came
in
small
ripples
green
and
purple
over
a
foundation
shade
of
dark
blue
the
pillar
seemed
rooted
below
and
it
extended
up
through
a
similar
opening
in
the
ceiling
providing
the
only
possible
exit
up
or
down
save
for
climbing
from
window
to
window
outside
travis
moved
slowly
to
the
well
underfoot
was
a
smooth
surface
overlaid
with
a
velvet
carpet
of
dust
which
arose
in
languid
puffs
as
he
walked
here
and
there
he
sighted
prints
in
the
dust
strange
triangular
wedges
which
he
thought
might
possibly
have
been
made
by
the
claws
of
birds
but
there
were
no
other
footprints
this
tower
had
been
undisturbed
for
a
long
long
time
he
came
to
the
well
and
looked
down
there
was
dark
there
dark
in
which
the
pulsations
of
light
from
the
pillar
shown
the
stronger
but
that
glow
did
not
extend
beyond
the
edge
of
the
well
through
which
the
thick
rod
threaded
even
by
close
examination
he
could
detect
no
break
in
the
smooth
surface
of
the
pillar
nothing
remotely
resembling
or
footholds
if
it
did
serve
the
purpose
of
a
staircase
there
were
no
treads
at
last
travis
put
out
his
hand
to
touch
the
surface
of
the
pillar
and
then
he
jerked
back
to
no
effect
there
was
no
breaking
contact
between
his
fingers
and
an
unknown
material
which
had
the
sleekness
of
polished
metal
but
and
the
thought
made
him
slightly
queasy
the
warmth
and
very
slight
give
of
flesh
he
summoned
all
his
strength
to
pull
free
and
could
not
not
only
did
that
hold
grip
him
but
his
other
hand
and
arm
were
being
drawn
to
join
the
first
inside
travis
primitive
fears
awoke
full
force
and
he
threw
back
his
head
voicing
a
cry
of
panic
as
wild
as
that
of
a
hunting
beast
an
instant
later
his
left
palm
was
as
tight
a
prisoner
as
his
right
and
with
both
hands
so
held
his
whole
body
was
suddenly
snapped
forward
off
the
safe
foundation
of
the
floor
tight
to
the
pillar
in
this
position
he
was
sucked
down
into
the
well
and
while
unable
to
free
himself
from
the
pillar
he
did
slip
along
its
length
easily
enough
travis
shut
his
eyes
in
an
involuntary
protest
against
this
weird
form
of
capture
and
a
shiver
ran
through
his
body
as
he
continued
to
descend
after
the
first
shock
had
subsided
the
apache
realized
that
he
was
not
truly
falling
at
all
had
the
pillar
been
horizontal
instead
of
vertical
he
would
have
gauged
its
speed
that
of
a
walk
he
passed
through
two
more
room
enclosures
he
must
already
be
below
the
level
of
the
valley
floor
outside
and
he
was
still
a
prisoner
of
the
pillar
now
in
total
darkness
his
feet
came
down
against
a
level
surface
and
he
guessed
he
must
have
reached
the
end
again
he
pulled
back
arching
his
shoulders
in
a
final
desperate
attempt
at
escape
and
stumbled
away
as
he
was
released
he
came
up
sideways
against
a
wall
and
stood
there
panting
the
light
which
might
have
come
from
the
pillar
but
which
seemed
more
a
part
of
the
very
air
was
bright
enough
to
reveal
that
he
was
in
a
corridor
running
into
greater
dark
both
right
and
left
travis
took
two
strides
back
to
the
pillar
fitted
his
palms
once
again
to
its
surface
with
no
result
this
time
his
flesh
did
not
adhere
and
there
was
no
possible
way
for
him
to
climb
that
slick
pole
he
could
only
hope
that
at
some
point
the
corridor
would
give
him
access
to
the
surface
but
which
way
to
go
at
last
he
chose
the
path
and
started
along
it
pausing
every
few
steps
to
listen
but
there
was
no
sound
except
the
soft
pad
of
his
own
feet
the
air
was
fresh
enough
and
he
thought
he
could
detect
a
faint
current
coming
toward
him
from
some
point
ahead
perhaps
an
exit
instead
he
came
into
a
room
and
a
small
gasp
of
astonishment
was
wrung
out
of
him
the
walls
were
blank
covered
with
the
same
ripples
of
light
which
colored
the
pillar
just
before
him
was
a
table
and
behind
it
a
bench
both
carved
from
the
native
mountain
rock
and
there
was
no
exit
except
the
doorway
in
which
he
now
stood
travis
walked
to
the
bench
immovable
it
was
placed
so
that
whoever
sat
there
must
face
the
opposite
wall
of
the
chamber
with
the
table
before
him
and
on
the
table
was
an
object
travis
recognized
immediately
from
his
voyage
in
the
alien
star
ship
one
of
the
through
which
the
involuntary
explorers
had
learned
what
little
they
knew
of
the
older
galactic
civilization
a
reader
and
beside
it
a
box
of
tapes
travis
touched
the
edge
of
that
box
gingerly
half
expecting
it
to
crumble
into
nothingness
this
was
a
place
long
deserted
stone
table
bench
the
towers
could
survive
through
centuries
of
abandonment
but
these
other
objects
the
substance
of
the
reader
was
firm
under
the
film
of
dust
there
was
less
dust
here
than
had
been
in
the
upper
tower
chamber
hardly
knowing
why
travis
threw
one
leg
over
the
bench
and
sat
down
behind
the
table
the
reader
before
him
the
box
of
tapes
just
beyond
his
hand
he
surveyed
the
walls
and
then
looked
away
hurriedly
the
rippling
colors
caught
at
his
eyes
he
had
a
feeling
that
if
he
watched
that
ebb
and
flow
too
long
he
would
be
captured
in
some
subtle
web
of
enchantment
just
as
the
reds
machine
had
caught
and
held
the
tatars
he
turned
his
attention
to
the
reader
it
was
he
believed
much
like
the
one
they
had
used
on
the
ship
this
room
table
bench
had
all
been
designed
with
a
set
purpose
and
that
purpose
travis
fingers
rested
on
the
box
of
tapes
he
could
not
yet
bring
himself
to
open
that
purpose
was
to
use
the
reader
he
would
swear
to
that
tapes
so
left
must
have
had
a
great
importance
for
those
who
left
them
it
was
as
if
the
whole
valley
was
a
trap
to
channel
a
stranger
into
this
underground
chamber
travis
snapped
open
the
box
fed
the
first
disk
into
the
reader
and
applied
his
eyes
to
the
vision
tube
at
its
apex
the
rippling
walls
looked
just
the
same
when
he
looked
up
once
more
but
the
cramp
in
his
muscles
told
travis
that
time
had
passed
perhaps
hours
instead
of
minutes
since
he
had
taken
out
the
first
disk
he
cupped
his
hands
over
his
eyes
and
tried
to
think
clearly
there
had
been
sheets
of
meaningless
symbol
writing
but
also
there
had
been
many
clear
pictures
accompanied
by
a
singsong
commentary
in
an
alien
tongue
seemingly
voiced
out
of
thin
air
he
had
been
stuffed
with
ragged
bits
and
patches
of
information
to
be
connected
only
by
guesses
and
some
wild
guesses
too
but
this
much
he
did
know
these
towers
had
been
built
by
the
bald
spacemen
and
they
were
highly
important
to
that
vanished
stellar
civilization
the
information
in
this
room
as
disjointed
as
it
had
been
for
him
led
to
a
treasure
trove
on
topaz
greater
than
he
had
dreamed
travis
swayed
on
the
bench
to
know
so
much
and
yet
so
little
if
ashe
were
only
here
or
some
other
of
the
project
technicians
a
treasure
such
as
pandora
box
had
been
peril
for
one
who
opened
it
and
did
not
understand
the
apache
studied
the
three
walls
of
in
turn
and
with
new
attention
there
were
ways
through
those
walls
he
was
fairly
sure
he
could
unlock
at
least
one
of
them
but
not
now
certainly
not
now
and
there
was
another
thing
he
knew
the
reds
must
find
this
such
a
discovery
on
their
part
would
not
only
mean
the
end
of
his
own
people
on
topaz
but
the
end
of
terra
as
well
this
could
be
a
new
and
alien
black
death
spread
to
destroy
whole
nations
at
a
time
if
he
could
much
as
his
archaeologist
training
would
argue
against
it
he
would
blot
out
this
whole
valley
above
and
below
ground
but
while
the
reds
might
possess
a
means
of
such
destruction
the
apaches
did
not
no
he
and
his
people
must
prevent
its
discovery
by
the
enemy
by
doing
what
he
had
seen
as
necessary
from
the
first
wiping
out
the
red
leaders
and
that
must
be
done
before
they
chanced
upon
the
towers
travis
arose
stiffly
his
eyes
ached
his
head
felt
stuffed
with
pictures
hints
speculations
he
wanted
to
get
out
back
into
the
open
air
where
perhaps
the
clean
winds
of
the
heights
would
blow
some
of
this
frightening
half
knowledge
from
his
benumbed
mind
he
lurched
down
the
corridor
puzzled
now
by
the
problem
of
getting
back
to
the
window
level
here
before
him
was
the
pillar
without
hope
but
still
obeying
some
buried
instinct
travis
again
set
his
hands
to
its
surface
there
was
a
tug
at
his
cramped
arms
once
more
his
body
was
sucked
to
the
pillar
this
time
he
was
rising
he
held
his
breath
past
the
first
level
and
then
relaxed
the
principle
of
this
weird
form
of
transportation
was
entirely
beyond
his
understanding
but
as
long
as
it
worked
in
reverse
he
did
care
to
find
out
he
reached
the
windowed
chamber
but
the
sunlight
had
left
it
instead
the
clean
cut
of
moon
sweep
lay
on
the
dusty
floor
he
must
have
been
hours
in
that
underground
place
travis
pulled
away
from
the
embrace
of
the
pillar
the
bar
of
his
wooden
lance
was
still
across
the
window
and
he
ran
for
it
to
catch
the
scouting
party
at
the
pass
he
must
hurry
the
report
they
would
make
to
the
clan
now
had
to
be
changed
radically
in
the
face
of
his
new
discoveries
the
apaches
dared
not
retreat
southward
and
withdraw
from
the
fight
leaving
the
reds
to
use
what
treasure
lay
here
as
he
hit
the
pavement
below
he
looked
about
for
the
coyotes
then
he
tried
the
mind
call
but
as
mysteriously
as
they
had
met
him
in
the
valley
so
now
were
they
gone
again
and
travis
had
no
time
to
hunt
for
them
with
a
sigh
he
began
his
race
to
the
pass
in
the
old
days
travis
remembered
apache
warriors
had
been
able
to
cover
or
fifty
miles
a
day
on
foot
and
over
rough
territory
but
perhaps
his
modern
breeding
had
slowed
him
he
had
been
so
sure
he
could
catch
up
before
the
others
were
through
the
pass
but
he
stood
now
in
the
hollow
where
they
had
camped
read
the
sign
of
overturned
stone
and
bent
twig
left
for
him
and
knew
they
would
reach
the
rancheria
and
report
the
decision
deklay
and
the
others
wanted
before
he
could
head
them
off
travis
slogged
on
he
was
so
tired
now
that
only
the
drug
from
the
sustenance
tablets
he
mouthed
at
intervals
kept
him
going
at
a
dogged
pace
hardly
more
than
a
swift
walk
and
always
his
mind
was
haunted
by
fragments
of
pictures
pictures
he
had
seen
in
the
reader
the
big
bomb
had
been
the
nightmare
of
his
own
world
for
so
long
and
what
was
that
against
the
forces
the
bald
star
rovers
had
been
able
to
command
he
fell
beside
a
stream
and
slept
there
was
sunshine
about
him
as
he
arose
to
stagger
on
what
day
was
this
how
long
had
he
sat
in
the
tower
chamber
he
was
not
sure
of
time
any
more
he
only
knew
that
he
must
reach
the
rancheria
tell
his
story
somehow
win
over
deklay
and
the
other
reactionaries
to
prove
the
necessity
for
invading
the
north
in
force
a
rocky
point
which
was
a
familiar
landmark
came
into
focus
he
padded
on
his
chest
heaving
his
breath
whistling
through
parched
lips
he
did
not
know
that
his
face
was
now
a
mask
of
driven
resolution
hahhhhhh
the
cry
reached
his
dulled
ears
travis
lifted
his
head
saw
the
men
before
him
and
tried
to
think
what
that
show
of
weapons
turned
toward
him
could
mean
a
stone
thudded
to
earth
only
inches
before
his
feet
to
be
followed
by
another
he
wavered
to
a
stop
witch
where
was
a
witch
travis
shook
his
head
there
was
no
witch
the
old
death
threat
but
why
for
whom
another
stone
this
one
hitting
him
in
the
ribs
with
force
enough
to
send
him
reeling
back
and
down
he
tried
to
get
up
again
saw
deklay
grin
widely
and
take
aim
and
at
last
travis
realized
what
was
happening
then
there
was
a
bursting
pain
in
his
head
and
he
was
falling
falling
into
a
well
of
black
this
time
with
no
pillar
of
blue
to
guide
him
the
rasp
of
something
wet
and
rough
persistent
against
his
cheek
travis
tried
to
turn
his
head
to
avoid
the
contact
and
was
answered
by
a
burst
of
pain
which
trailed
off
into
a
giddiness
making
him
fear
another
move
no
matter
how
minor
he
opened
his
eyes
and
saw
the
pointed
ears
the
outline
of
a
coyote
head
between
him
and
a
dull
gray
sky
was
able
to
recognize
a
wetness
other
than
that
from
the
coyote
tongue
slid
down
his
forehead
now
the
dull
clouds
overhead
had
released
the
first
heavy
rain
travis
had
experienced
since
their
landing
on
topaz
he
shivered
as
the
chill
damp
of
his
clothes
made
him
aware
that
he
must
have
been
lying
out
in
the
full
force
of
the
downpour
for
some
time
it
was
a
struggle
to
get
to
his
knees
but
mouthed
a
hold
on
his
shirt
tugging
and
pulling
so
that
somehow
he
crept
into
a
hollow
beneath
the
branches
of
a
tree
where
the
spouting
water
was
lessened
to
a
few
pattering
drops
there
the
apache
strength
deserted
him
again
and
he
could
only
hunch
over
his
bent
knees
against
his
chest
trying
to
endure
the
throbbing
misery
in
his
head
the
awful
floating
sensation
which
followed
any
movement
fighting
against
that
he
tried
to
remember
just
what
had
happened
the
meeting
with
deklay
and
at
least
four
or
five
others
then
the
apache
accusation
of
witchcraft
a
serious
thing
in
the
old
days
old
days
to
deklay
and
his
fellows
these
the
old
days
and
the
threat
that
deklay
or
some
other
had
shouted
at
him
meant
literally
it
wo
dawn
for
you
death
stones
the
last
thing
travis
remembered
were
the
stones
slowly
his
hands
went
out
to
explore
his
body
there
was
more
than
one
bruised
area
on
his
shoulders
and
ribs
even
on
his
thighs
he
must
still
have
been
a
target
after
he
had
fallen
under
the
stone
which
had
knocked
him
unconscious
stoned
outlawed
but
why
surely
deklay
hostility
could
not
have
swept
buck
tsoay
even
nolan
into
agreeing
to
that
now
he
could
not
think
straight
travis
became
aware
of
warmth
not
only
of
warmth
and
the
soft
touch
of
a
furred
body
by
his
side
but
a
comforting
communication
of
mind
a
feeling
he
had
no
words
to
describe
adequately
was
sitting
crowded
against
him
her
nose
thrust
up
to
rest
on
his
shoulder
she
breathed
in
soft
puffs
which
stirred
the
loose
locks
of
his
hair
and
now
he
flung
one
arm
about
her
a
gesture
which
brought
a
whisper
of
answering
whine
he
was
past
wondering
about
the
actions
of
the
coyotes
only
supremely
thankful
for
present
companionship
and
a
moment
later
when
her
mate
squeezed
under
the
low
loop
of
a
branch
and
joined
them
in
this
natural
wickiup
travis
held
out
his
other
hand
drew
it
lovingly
across
naginlta
wet
hide
now
what
he
asked
aloud
deklay
could
only
have
taken
such
a
drastic
action
with
the
majority
of
the
clan
solidly
behind
him
it
could
well
be
that
this
reactionary
was
the
new
chief
this
act
of
expulsion
merely
adding
to
deklay
growing
prestige
the
shivering
which
had
begun
when
travis
recovered
consciousness
still
shook
him
at
intervals
back
on
terra
like
all
the
others
in
the
team
he
had
had
every
inoculation
known
to
the
space
physicians
including
several
experimental
ones
but
the
cold
virus
could
still
practically
immobilize
a
man
and
this
was
no
time
to
give
body
room
to
chills
and
fever
catching
his
breath
as
his
movements
touched
to
life
the
pain
in
one
bruise
after
another
travis
peeled
off
his
soaked
clothing
rubbed
his
body
dry
with
handfuls
of
last
year
leaves
culled
from
the
thick
carpet
under
him
knowing
there
was
nothing
he
could
do
until
the
whirling
in
his
head
disappeared
so
he
burrowed
into
the
leaves
until
only
his
head
was
uncovered
and
tried
to
sleep
the
coyotes
curling
up
one
on
either
side
of
his
nest
he
dreamed
but
later
could
not
remember
any
incident
from
those
dreams
save
a
certain
frustration
and
fear
when
he
awoke
again
to
the
sound
of
steady
rain
it
was
dark
he
reached
out
both
coyotes
were
gone
his
head
was
clearer
and
suddenly
he
knew
what
must
be
done
as
soon
as
his
body
was
strong
enough
he
too
would
return
to
instincts
and
customs
of
the
past
this
situation
was
desperate
enough
for
him
to
challenge
deklay
in
the
dark
travis
frowned
he
was
slightly
taller
and
three
or
four
years
younger
than
his
enemy
but
deklay
had
the
advantage
in
a
stouter
build
and
longer
reach
however
travis
was
sure
that
in
his
present
life
deklay
had
never
fought
a
duel
apache
fashion
and
an
apache
duel
was
not
a
meeting
anyone
entered
into
lightly
travis
had
the
right
to
enter
the
rancheria
and
deliver
such
a
challenge
then
deklay
must
meet
him
or
admit
himself
in
the
wrong
that
part
of
it
was
simple
but
in
the
past
such
duels
had
just
one
end
a
fatal
one
for
at
least
one
of
the
fighters
if
travis
took
this
trail
he
must
be
prepared
to
go
the
limit
and
he
did
want
to
kill
deklay
there
were
too
few
of
them
here
on
topaz
to
make
any
loss
less
than
a
real
catastrophe
while
he
had
no
liking
for
deklay
neither
did
he
nurse
any
hatred
however
he
must
challenge
the
other
or
remain
a
tribal
outcast
and
travis
had
no
right
to
gamble
with
time
and
the
future
not
after
what
he
had
learned
in
the
tower
it
might
be
his
life
and
skill
or
deklay
against
the
blotting
out
of
them
all
and
their
home
world
into
the
bargain
first
he
must
locate
the
present
camp
of
the
clan
if
nolan
arguments
had
counted
they
would
be
heading
south
away
from
the
pass
and
to
follow
would
draw
him
farther
from
the
tower
valley
travis
battered
face
ached
as
he
grinned
bitterly
this
was
another
time
when
a
man
could
wish
he
were
two
people
a
scout
on
sentry
duty
at
the
valley
the
fighter
heading
in
the
opposite
direction
to
have
it
out
with
deklay
but
since
he
was
merely
one
man
he
would
have
to
gamble
on
time
one
of
the
trickiest
risks
of
all
before
dawn
returned
carrying
with
her
a
bird
or
at
least
birds
must
have
been
somewhere
in
the
creature
ancestry
but
the
present
representative
of
its
kind
had
only
vestigial
remnants
of
wings
its
trailing
feet
and
legs
well
developed
and
far
more
powerful
travis
skinned
the
corpse
automatically
putting
aside
some
spine
quills
to
feather
future
arrows
then
he
ate
slivers
of
dusky
meat
raw
throwing
the
bones
to
though
he
was
still
stiff
and
sore
travis
was
determined
to
be
on
his
way
he
tried
mind
contact
with
the
coyote
picturing
the
apaches
notably
deklay
as
sharply
as
he
could
by
mental
image
and
her
assent
was
clear
in
return
she
and
her
mate
were
willing
to
lead
him
to
the
tribe
he
gave
a
light
sigh
of
relief
as
he
slogged
on
through
the
depressing
drizzle
the
apache
wondered
again
why
the
coyotes
had
left
him
before
and
waited
in
the
tower
valley
what
link
was
there
between
the
animals
of
terra
and
the
remains
of
the
empire
of
the
stars
for
he
was
certain
it
was
not
by
chance
that
and
naginlta
had
lingered
in
that
misty
place
he
longed
to
communicate
with
them
directly
to
ask
questions
and
be
answered
without
their
aid
travis
would
never
have
been
able
to
track
the
clan
the
drizzle
alternated
with
slashing
bursts
of
rain
torrential
enough
to
drive
the
trackers
to
the
nearest
cover
overhead
the
sky
was
either
dull
bronze
or
night
black
even
the
coyotes
paced
nose
to
ground
often
making
wide
casts
for
the
trail
while
travis
waited
the
rain
lasted
for
three
days
and
nights
filling
watercourses
with
rapidly
rising
streams
travis
could
only
hope
that
the
others
were
having
the
same
difficulty
traveling
that
he
was
perhaps
the
more
so
since
they
were
burdened
with
packs
the
fact
that
they
kept
on
meant
that
they
were
determined
to
get
as
far
from
the
northern
mountains
as
they
could
on
the
fourth
morning
the
bronze
of
the
clouds
slowly
thinned
into
the
usual
gold
and
the
sun
struck
across
hills
where
mist
curled
like
steam
from
a
hundred
bubbling
pots
travis
relaxed
in
the
welcome
warmth
feeling
his
shirt
dry
on
his
shoulders
it
was
still
a
waterlogged
terrain
ahead
which
should
continue
to
slow
the
clan
he
had
high
expectations
of
catching
up
with
them
soon
and
now
the
worst
of
his
bruises
had
faded
his
muscles
were
limber
and
he
had
worked
out
his
plan
as
best
he
could
two
hours
later
he
sat
in
ambush
waiting
for
the
scout
who
was
walking
into
his
hands
under
the
direction
of
the
coyotes
travis
had
circled
the
line
of
march
come
in
ahead
of
the
clan
now
he
needed
an
emissary
to
state
his
challenge
and
the
fact
that
the
scout
he
was
about
to
jump
was
manulito
one
of
deklay
supporters
suited
travis
purpose
perfectly
he
gathered
his
feet
under
him
as
the
other
came
opposite
and
sprang
the
rush
carried
manulito
off
his
feet
and
face
down
on
the
sod
while
travis
made
the
best
of
his
advantage
and
pinned
the
wildly
fighting
man
under
him
had
it
been
one
of
the
older
braves
he
might
not
have
been
so
successful
but
manulito
was
still
a
boy
by
apache
standards
lie
still
travis
ordered
listen
well
so
you
can
say
to
deklay
the
words
of
the
fox
the
frenzied
struggles
ceased
manulito
managed
to
wrench
his
head
to
the
left
so
he
could
see
his
captor
travis
loosened
his
grip
got
to
his
feet
manulito
sat
up
his
face
darkly
sullen
but
he
did
not
reach
for
his
knife
you
will
say
this
to
deklay
the
fox
says
he
is
a
man
of
little
sense
and
less
courage
preferring
to
throw
stones
rather
than
meet
knife
to
knife
as
does
a
warrior
if
he
thinks
as
a
warrior
let
him
prove
it
his
strength
against
my
strength
after
the
ways
of
the
people
some
of
the
sullenness
left
manulito
expression
he
was
eager
excited
you
would
duel
with
deklay
after
the
old
custom
i
would
say
this
to
deklay
openly
so
that
all
men
may
hear
then
deklay
must
also
give
answer
openly
manulito
flushed
at
that
implication
concerning
his
leader
courage
and
travis
knew
that
he
would
deliver
the
challenge
openly
to
keep
his
hold
on
the
clan
the
latter
must
accept
it
and
there
would
be
an
audience
of
his
people
to
witness
the
success
or
defeat
of
their
new
chief
and
his
policies
as
manulito
disappeared
travis
summoned
the
coyotes
putting
full
effort
into
getting
across
one
message
any
tribe
led
by
deklay
would
be
hostile
to
the
mutant
animals
they
must
go
into
hiding
run
free
in
the
wilderness
if
the
gamble
failed
travis
now
they
withdrew
into
the
bushes
but
not
out
of
reach
of
his
mind
he
did
not
have
too
long
to
wait
first
came
buck
nolan
tsoay
lupe
those
who
had
been
with
him
on
the
northern
scout
then
the
others
the
warriors
first
the
women
making
a
half
circle
behind
leaving
a
free
space
in
which
deklay
walked
i
am
the
fox
travis
stated
and
this
one
has
named
me
witch
and
outlaw
of
the
mountains
therefore
do
i
come
to
name
names
in
my
turn
hear
me
people
this
deklay
he
would
walk
among
you
as
a
great
chief
but
he
does
not
have
the
the
holy
power
of
a
chief
for
this
deklay
is
a
fool
with
a
head
filled
by
nothing
but
his
own
wishes
not
caring
for
his
clan
brothers
he
says
he
leads
you
into
safety
i
say
he
leads
you
into
the
worst
danger
any
living
man
can
imagine
even
in
peyote
dreams
he
is
one
twisted
in
his
thoughts
and
he
would
make
you
twisted
also
buck
cut
in
sharply
hushing
the
murmur
of
the
massed
clan
these
are
bold
words
fox
will
you
back
them
travis
hands
were
already
peeling
off
his
shirt
i
will
back
them
he
stated
between
set
teeth
he
had
known
since
his
awakening
after
the
stoning
that
this
next
move
was
the
only
one
left
for
him
to
make
but
now
that
the
testing
of
his
action
came
he
could
not
be
certain
of
the
outcome
of
anything
save
that
the
final
decision
of
this
battle
might
affect
more
than
the
fate
of
two
men
he
stripped
noting
that
deklay
was
doing
the
same
having
stepped
into
the
center
of
the
glade
nolan
was
using
the
point
of
his
knife
to
score
a
circle
there
naked
except
for
his
moccasins
with
only
his
knife
in
his
hand
travis
took
the
two
strides
which
put
him
in
the
circle
facing
deklay
he
surveyed
his
finely
muscled
body
realizing
that
his
earlier
estimate
of
probable
advantages
were
close
to
the
mark
in
sheer
strength
the
other
outmatched
him
whether
deklay
was
skillful
with
his
knife
was
another
question
one
which
travis
would
soon
be
able
to
answer
they
circled
eyes
intent
upon
each
move
striving
to
weigh
and
measure
each
other
strengths
and
weaknesses
knife
dueling
among
the
travis
remembered
had
once
been
an
art
close
to
finished
swordplay
with
two
evenly
matched
fighters
able
to
engage
for
a
long
time
without
seriously
marking
each
other
but
this
was
a
far
rougher
and
more
deadly
game
with
none
of
the
niceties
of
such
a
meeting
he
evaded
a
vicious
thrust
from
deklay
the
bull
charges
he
laughed
and
the
fox
snaps
by
some
incredible
stroke
of
good
fortune
the
point
of
his
weapon
actually
grazed
arm
drawing
a
thin
red
line
across
the
skin
charge
again
bull
feel
once
more
the
fox
teeth
he
strove
to
goad
deklay
into
a
crippling
loss
of
temper
knowing
how
the
other
could
explode
into
violent
rage
it
was
dangerous
that
rage
but
it
could
also
make
a
man
blindly
careless
there
was
an
inarticulate
sound
from
deklay
a
dusky
swelling
in
the
man
face
he
spat
as
might
an
enraged
puma
and
rushed
at
travis
who
did
not
quite
manage
to
avoid
the
lunge
falling
back
with
a
smarting
slash
across
the
ribs
the
bull
gores
deklay
bellowed
horns
toss
the
fox
he
rushed
again
elated
by
the
sight
of
the
trickling
wound
on
side
but
the
slighter
man
slipped
away
travis
knew
he
must
be
careful
in
such
evasions
one
foot
across
the
ridged
circle
and
he
was
finished
as
much
as
if
deklay
blade
had
found
its
mark
travis
tried
a
thrust
of
his
own
and
his
foot
came
down
hard
on
a
sharp
pebble
through
the
sole
of
his
moccasin
pain
shot
upward
caused
him
to
stumble
again
the
scarlet
flame
of
a
wound
down
his
shoulder
and
forearm
this
time
well
there
was
one
trick
he
knew
travis
tossed
the
knife
into
the
air
caught
it
with
his
left
hand
deklay
was
now
facing
a
fighter
and
must
adjust
to
that
paw
bull
rattle
your
horns
travis
cried
the
fox
still
shows
his
teeth
deklay
recovered
from
his
instant
of
surprise
with
a
cry
which
was
indeed
like
the
bellow
of
an
old
range
bull
he
rushed
into
grapple
sure
of
his
superior
strength
against
a
younger
and
already
wounded
man
travis
ducked
one
knee
thumping
the
ground
he
groped
out
with
his
right
hand
caught
up
a
handful
of
earth
and
flung
it
into
the
dusky
brown
face
again
it
seemed
that
luck
was
on
his
side
that
handful
could
not
be
as
blinding
as
sand
but
some
bit
of
the
shower
landed
in
deklay
eye
for
a
space
of
seconds
deklay
was
wide
open
open
for
a
blow
which
would
rip
him
up
the
middle
the
blow
travis
could
not
and
would
not
deliver
instead
he
took
the
offensive
recklessly
springing
straight
for
his
opponent
as
the
fingers
of
one
hand
clawed
into
face
he
struck
with
the
other
not
with
the
point
of
the
knife
but
with
its
shaft
but
deklay
already
only
half
conscious
from
the
blow
had
his
own
chance
he
fell
to
the
ground
leaving
his
knife
behind
two
inches
of
steel
between
travis
ribs
somehow
he
did
know
from
where
he
drew
that
strength
travis
kept
his
feet
and
took
one
step
and
then
another
out
of
the
circle
until
the
comforting
brace
of
a
tree
trunk
was
against
his
bare
back
was
he
finished
he
fought
to
nurse
his
rags
of
consciousness
had
he
summoned
buck
with
his
eyes
or
had
the
urgency
of
what
he
had
to
say
reached
somehow
from
mind
to
mind
the
other
was
at
his
side
but
travis
put
out
a
hand
to
ward
him
off
towers
he
struggled
to
keep
his
wits
through
the
pain
and
billowing
weakness
beginning
to
creep
through
him
reds
must
get
to
the
towers
worse
than
the
bomb
end
us
all
he
had
a
hazy
glimpse
of
nolan
and
closing
in
about
him
the
desire
to
cough
tore
at
him
but
they
had
to
know
to
believe
reds
get
to
the
towers
everything
finished
not
only
here
maybe
back
home
too
did
he
read
comprehension
on
buck
face
would
nolan
and
and
the
rest
believe
him
travis
could
not
suppress
the
cough
any
longer
and
the
ripping
pain
which
followed
was
the
worst
he
had
ever
experienced
but
still
he
kept
his
feet
tried
to
make
them
understand
do
let
them
get
to
the
towers
find
that
storehouse
travis
stood
away
from
the
tree
reached
out
to
buck
his
earth
and
bloodstained
hand
i
swear
truth
this
must
be
done
he
was
going
down
and
he
had
a
queer
thought
that
once
he
reached
the
ground
everything
would
end
not
only
for
him
but
also
for
his
mission
trying
to
see
the
faces
of
the
men
about
him
was
like
attempting
to
identify
the
people
in
a
dream
towers
he
had
meant
to
shout
it
but
he
could
not
even
hear
for
himself
that
last
word
as
he
fell
travis
back
was
braced
against
blanketed
packs
as
he
steadied
a
piece
of
bark
against
one
bent
knee
scowling
at
the
lines
drawn
on
it
in
faint
green
we
are
here
then
and
the
ship
there
his
thumb
was
set
on
one
point
of
the
crude
map
forefinger
on
the
other
buck
nodded
that
is
so
tsoay
eskelta
kawaykle
they
watch
the
trails
there
is
the
pass
two
other
ways
men
can
come
on
foot
but
who
can
watch
the
air
the
tatars
say
the
reds
dare
not
bring
the
into
the
mountains
after
they
first
landed
they
lost
a
flyer
in
a
tricky
flow
up
there
they
have
only
one
left
and
wo
risk
it
if
only
they
reinforced
before
we
can
move
there
it
was
again
that
constant
gnawing
fear
of
time
time
shortening
into
a
rope
to
strangle
them
all
you
think
that
the
knowledge
of
our
ship
will
bring
them
into
the
open
that
or
information
about
the
towers
would
be
the
only
things
important
enough
to
pull
out
their
experts
they
could
send
a
controlled
tatar
party
to
explore
the
ship
sure
but
that
would
give
them
the
technical
reports
they
need
no
i
think
if
they
knew
a
wrecked
western
confederation
ship
was
here
it
would
bring
them
or
enough
of
them
to
lessen
the
odds
we
have
to
catch
them
in
the
open
otherwise
they
can
hole
up
forever
in
that
of
theirs
and
just
how
do
we
let
them
know
our
ship
is
here
send
out
another
scouting
party
and
let
them
be
trailed
back
that
our
last
resource
travis
continued
to
frown
at
the
map
yes
it
would
be
possible
to
let
the
reds
sight
and
trail
an
apache
party
but
there
was
none
in
the
clan
who
were
expendable
surely
there
was
some
other
way
of
laying
the
trap
with
the
wrecked
ship
for
bait
capture
one
of
the
reds
let
him
escape
again
having
seen
what
they
wanted
him
to
see
again
a
business
and
how
long
would
they
have
to
wait
and
what
risks
would
they
take
to
pick
up
a
red
prisoner
if
the
tatars
were
dependable
buck
was
thinking
aloud
but
that
if
was
far
too
big
they
could
not
trust
the
tatars
no
matter
how
much
the
mongols
wanted
to
aid
in
pulling
down
the
reds
as
long
as
they
could
be
controlled
by
the
caller
they
were
useless
or
were
they
thought
of
something
buck
must
have
caught
travis
change
of
expression
suppose
a
tatar
saw
our
ship
and
then
was
picked
up
by
a
red
hunting
patrol
and
they
got
the
information
out
of
him
do
you
think
any
outlaw
would
volunteer
to
let
himself
be
picked
up
again
and
if
he
did
would
the
reds
also
be
able
to
learn
that
he
had
been
set
up
for
the
trap
an
escaped
prisoner
travis
suggested
now
buck
was
plainly
considering
the
possibilities
of
such
a
scheme
and
travis
own
spirits
rose
a
little
the
idea
was
full
of
holes
but
it
could
be
worked
out
suppose
they
capture
say
menlik
bring
him
here
as
a
prisoner
let
him
think
they
were
about
to
kill
him
because
of
that
attack
back
in
the
foothills
then
let
him
escape
pursue
him
northward
to
a
point
where
he
could
be
driven
into
the
hands
of
the
reds
very
chancy
but
it
just
might
work
travis
was
favoring
a
gamble
now
since
his
desperate
one
with
the
duel
had
paid
off
the
risk
he
had
accepted
then
had
cost
him
two
deep
wounds
one
of
which
might
have
been
serious
if
medical
training
had
not
been
to
hand
but
it
had
also
made
travis
one
of
the
clan
again
with
his
people
willing
to
listen
to
his
warning
concerning
the
tower
treasury
the
girl
the
tatar
girl
at
first
travis
did
not
understand
buck
ejaculation
we
get
the
girl
the
other
elaborated
let
her
escape
then
hunt
her
to
where
they
pick
her
up
might
even
imprison
her
in
the
ship
to
begin
with
kaydessa
though
something
within
him
rebelled
at
that
selection
for
the
leading
role
in
their
drama
travis
could
see
the
advantage
of
choice
was
an
ancient
pastime
among
primitive
cultures
the
tatars
themselves
had
found
wives
that
way
in
the
past
just
as
the
apache
raiders
of
old
had
taken
captive
women
into
their
wickiups
yes
for
raiders
to
steal
a
woman
would
be
a
natural
act
accepted
as
such
by
the
reds
for
the
same
woman
to
endeavor
to
escape
and
be
hunted
by
her
captors
also
was
reasonable
and
for
such
a
woman
cut
off
from
her
outlaw
kin
to
eventually
head
back
toward
the
red
settlement
as
the
only
hope
of
evading
her
enemies
logical
all
the
way
she
would
have
to
be
well
frightened
travis
observed
with
reluctance
that
can
be
done
for
us
travis
glanced
at
buck
with
sharp
annoyance
he
would
not
allow
certain
games
out
of
their
common
past
to
be
played
with
kaydessa
but
buck
had
something
very
different
from
brutality
in
mind
three
days
ago
while
you
were
still
flat
on
your
back
deklay
and
i
went
back
to
the
ship
deklay
you
beat
him
openly
so
he
must
restore
his
honor
in
his
own
sight
and
the
council
has
forbidden
another
duel
or
challenge
buck
replied
therefore
he
will
continue
to
push
for
recognition
in
another
way
and
now
that
he
has
heard
your
story
and
knows
we
must
face
the
reds
not
run
from
them
he
is
eager
to
take
the
war
trail
too
eager
so
we
returned
to
the
ship
to
make
another
search
for
weapons
there
were
none
there
before
except
those
we
had
nor
now
either
but
we
discovered
something
else
buck
paused
and
travis
was
shaken
out
of
his
absorption
with
the
problem
at
hand
by
a
note
in
the
other
voice
it
was
as
if
buck
had
come
upon
something
he
could
not
summon
the
right
words
to
describe
first
buck
continued
there
was
this
dead
thing
there
near
where
we
found
ruthven
it
was
something
like
a
man
but
all
silvery
hair
the
the
from
the
other
worlds
what
else
did
you
see
travis
had
dropped
the
map
his
side
gave
him
a
painful
twinge
as
he
caught
at
buck
sleeve
the
bald
space
rovers
did
they
still
exist
here
somewhere
had
they
come
to
explore
the
ship
built
on
the
pattern
of
their
own
but
manned
by
terrans
nothing
except
tracks
a
lot
of
them
in
every
open
cabin
and
hole
i
think
there
must
have
been
a
sizable
pack
of
the
things
what
killed
the
dead
one
buck
wet
his
lips
i
think
fear
his
voice
dropped
a
little
almost
apologetically
and
travis
stared
the
ship
is
changed
inside
there
is
something
wrong
when
you
walk
the
corridors
your
skin
crawls
you
think
there
is
something
behind
you
you
hear
things
see
things
from
the
corners
of
your
eyes
when
you
turn
there
nothing
nothing
at
all
and
the
higher
you
climb
into
the
ship
the
worse
it
is
i
tell
you
travis
never
have
i
felt
anything
like
it
before
it
was
a
ship
of
many
dead
travis
reminded
him
had
the
apache
fear
of
the
dead
been
activated
by
the
redax
into
an
acute
phobia
to
strike
down
such
a
man
as
buck
no
at
first
that
too
was
my
thought
then
i
discovered
that
it
was
worst
not
near
that
chamber
where
we
lay
our
dead
but
higher
in
the
redax
cabin
i
think
perhaps
the
machine
is
still
running
but
running
in
a
wrong
way
so
that
it
does
not
awaken
old
memories
of
our
ancestors
now
but
brings
into
being
all
the
fears
which
have
ever
haunted
us
through
the
dark
of
the
ages
i
tell
you
travis
when
i
came
out
of
that
place
deklay
was
leading
me
by
the
hand
as
if
i
were
a
child
and
he
was
shivering
as
a
man
who
will
never
be
warm
again
there
is
an
evil
there
beyond
our
understanding
i
think
that
this
tatar
girl
were
she
only
to
stay
there
a
very
short
time
would
be
well
frightened
so
frightened
that
any
trained
scientist
examining
her
later
would
know
there
was
a
mystery
to
be
explored
the
could
they
have
tried
to
run
the
redax
travis
wondered
to
associate
machines
with
the
creatures
was
outwardly
pure
folly
but
they
had
been
discovered
on
two
of
the
planets
of
the
old
civilization
and
ashe
had
thought
that
they
might
represent
the
degenerate
remnants
of
a
once
intelligent
species
that
is
possible
if
so
they
raised
a
storm
which
drove
them
out
and
killed
one
of
them
the
ship
is
a
haunted
place
now
but
for
us
to
use
the
girl
travis
had
seen
the
logic
in
first
suggestion
but
now
he
differed
if
the
atmosphere
of
the
ship
was
as
terrifying
as
buck
said
to
imprison
kaydessa
there
even
temporarily
was
still
wrong
she
need
not
remain
long
suppose
we
should
do
this
we
shall
enter
with
her
and
then
allow
the
disturbance
we
would
feel
to
overcome
us
we
could
run
leave
her
alone
when
she
left
the
ship
we
could
then
take
up
the
chase
shepherding
her
back
to
the
country
she
knows
within
the
ship
we
would
be
with
her
and
could
see
she
did
not
remain
too
long
travis
could
see
a
good
prospect
in
that
plan
there
was
one
thing
he
would
insist
on
if
kaydessa
was
to
be
in
that
ship
he
himself
would
be
one
of
the
captors
he
said
as
much
and
buck
accepted
his
determination
as
final
they
dispatched
a
scouting
party
to
infiltrate
the
territory
to
the
north
to
watch
and
wait
their
chance
of
capture
travis
strove
to
regain
his
feet
to
be
ready
to
move
when
the
moment
came
five
days
later
he
was
able
to
reach
the
ridge
beyond
which
lay
the
wrecked
ship
with
him
were
lupe
and
manulito
they
satisfied
themselves
that
the
globe
had
had
no
visitors
since
buck
and
deklay
there
was
no
sign
that
the
had
returned
from
here
travis
said
the
ship
does
look
too
bad
almost
as
if
it
might
be
able
to
take
off
again
it
might
lift
gestured
to
the
mountaintop
behind
the
curve
of
the
globe
about
that
far
the
tubes
on
this
side
are
intact
what
would
happen
were
the
reds
to
get
inside
and
try
to
fly
again
manulito
wondered
aloud
travis
was
struck
by
a
sudden
idea
one
perhaps
just
as
wild
as
the
other
inspirations
he
had
had
since
landing
on
topaz
but
one
to
be
studied
and
explored
not
dismissed
without
consideration
suppose
enough
power
remained
to
lift
the
ship
partially
and
then
blow
it
up
with
the
red
technicians
on
board
at
the
time
but
he
was
no
engineer
he
had
no
idea
whether
any
part
of
the
globe
might
or
might
not
work
again
they
are
not
fools
a
close
look
would
tell
them
it
is
a
wreck
countered
travis
walked
on
not
too
far
ahead
a
shape
moved
out
of
the
brush
stood
in
his
path
facing
the
ship
and
growling
in
a
harsh
rumble
of
sound
whatever
moved
or
operated
in
that
wreck
was
picked
up
by
the
acute
sense
of
the
coyote
even
at
this
distance
on
travis
edged
around
the
snarling
animal
with
one
halting
step
and
then
another
it
followed
him
there
was
a
sharp
warning
yelp
from
the
brush
and
a
second
coyote
head
appeared
naginlta
followed
travis
but
refused
to
approach
the
grounded
globe
travis
surveyed
the
ship
closely
trying
to
remember
the
layout
of
its
interior
to
turn
the
whole
sphere
into
a
trap
was
it
possible
how
had
ashe
said
the
redax
worked
something
about
waves
stimulating
certain
brain
and
nerve
centers
what
if
one
were
shielded
from
those
rays
that
tear
in
the
side
he
himself
must
have
climbed
through
that
the
night
they
crashed
and
the
break
was
not
too
far
from
the
space
lock
near
the
lock
was
a
storage
compartment
and
if
it
had
not
been
jammed
or
its
contents
crushed
they
might
have
something
he
beckoned
to
give
me
a
hand
up
there
why
i
want
to
see
if
the
space
suits
are
intact
regarded
travis
with
open
bewilderment
but
manulito
pushed
forward
we
do
not
need
those
suits
to
walk
here
travis
this
air
we
can
breathe
not
for
the
air
and
not
in
the
open
travis
advanced
at
a
deliberate
pace
those
suits
may
be
insulated
in
more
ways
than
one
against
a
redax
broadcast
you
mean
exclaimed
yes
but
you
stay
here
younger
brother
this
is
a
risky
climb
and
you
are
not
yet
strong
travis
was
forced
to
accede
to
that
waiting
as
manulito
and
lupe
climbed
up
to
the
tear
and
entered
at
least
buck
and
experience
had
forewarned
them
and
they
would
be
prepared
for
the
weird
ghosts
haunting
the
interior
but
when
they
returned
pulling
between
them
the
limp
space
suit
both
men
were
pale
the
shiny
sheen
of
sweat
on
their
foreheads
their
hands
shaking
lupe
sat
down
on
the
ground
before
travis
evil
spirits
he
said
giving
to
this
modern
phenomenon
the
old
name
truly
ghosts
and
witches
walk
in
there
manulito
had
spread
the
suit
on
the
ground
and
was
examining
it
with
a
care
which
spoke
of
familiarity
this
is
unharmed
he
reported
ready
to
wear
the
suits
were
all
tailored
for
size
travis
knew
and
this
fitted
a
slender
man
it
would
fit
him
travis
fox
but
manulito
was
already
unbuckling
the
fastenings
with
practiced
ease
i
shall
try
it
out
he
announced
and
travis
seeing
the
awkward
climb
to
the
entrance
of
the
ship
had
to
agree
that
the
first
test
should
be
carried
out
by
someone
more
agile
at
the
moment
sealed
into
the
suit
with
the
bubble
helmet
locked
in
place
the
apache
climbed
back
into
the
globe
the
only
form
of
communication
with
him
was
the
rope
he
had
tied
about
him
and
if
he
went
above
the
first
level
he
would
have
to
leave
that
behind
in
the
first
few
moments
they
saw
no
twitch
of
alarm
running
along
the
rope
after
counting
fifty
slowly
travis
gave
it
a
tentative
jerk
to
find
it
firmly
fastened
within
so
manulito
had
tied
it
there
and
was
climbing
to
the
control
cabin
they
continued
to
wait
with
what
patience
they
could
muster
naginlta
pacing
up
and
down
a
good
distance
from
the
ship
whined
at
intervals
the
warning
echoed
each
time
by
his
mate
upslope
i
do
like
it
travis
broke
off
when
the
helmeted
figure
appeared
again
at
the
break
moving
slowly
in
his
cumbersome
clothing
manulito
reached
the
ground
fumbled
with
the
catch
of
his
head
covering
and
then
stood
taking
deep
gulps
of
air
well
travis
demanded
i
see
no
ghosts
manulito
said
grinning
this
is
he
slapped
his
gloved
hand
against
the
covering
over
his
chest
there
is
also
this
from
what
i
know
of
these
ships
some
of
the
relays
still
work
i
think
this
could
be
made
into
a
trap
we
could
entice
the
reds
in
and
then
his
hand
moved
in
a
quick
upward
flip
but
we
do
know
anything
about
the
engines
travis
replied
no
listen
you
fox
are
not
the
only
one
to
remember
useful
knowledge
manulito
had
lost
his
cheerful
grin
do
you
think
we
are
just
the
savages
those
big
brains
back
at
the
project
wished
us
to
be
they
have
played
a
trick
on
us
with
their
redax
so
we
can
play
a
few
tricks
too
me
i
went
to
or
is
that
one
of
the
things
you
no
longer
remember
fox
travis
swallowed
hastily
he
really
had
forgotten
that
fact
until
this
very
minute
from
the
beginning
the
apache
team
had
been
carefully
selected
and
screened
not
only
for
survival
potential
which
was
their
basic
value
to
the
project
but
also
for
certain
individual
skills
just
as
travis
grounding
in
archaeology
had
been
one
advantage
so
had
manulito
technical
training
made
a
valuable
though
different
contribution
if
at
first
the
redax
used
without
warning
had
smothered
that
training
perhaps
the
effects
were
now
fading
you
can
do
something
then
he
asked
eagerly
i
can
try
there
is
a
chance
to
booby
trap
the
control
cabin
at
least
and
that
is
where
they
would
poke
and
pry
working
in
this
suit
will
be
tough
how
about
my
trying
to
smash
up
the
redax
first
not
until
after
we
use
it
on
our
captive
decided
then
there
would
be
some
time
before
the
reds
come
you
talk
as
if
they
come
cut
in
lupe
how
can
you
be
sure
we
ca
travis
agreed
but
we
can
count
on
this
much
judging
from
the
past
once
they
know
that
there
is
a
wrecked
ship
here
they
will
be
forced
to
explore
it
they
can
not
afford
an
enemy
settlement
on
this
side
of
the
mountains
that
would
be
according
to
their
way
of
thinking
an
eternal
threat
nodded
that
is
true
this
is
a
complicated
plan
yes
and
one
in
which
many
things
may
go
wrong
but
it
is
also
one
which
covers
all
the
loopholes
we
know
of
with
lupe
aid
manulito
crawled
out
of
the
suit
as
he
leaned
it
carefully
against
a
supporting
rock
he
said
i
have
been
thinking
of
this
treasure
house
in
the
towers
suppose
we
could
find
new
weapons
there
travis
hesitated
he
still
shrank
from
the
thought
of
opening
the
secret
places
behind
those
glowing
walls
to
loose
a
new
peril
if
we
took
weapons
from
there
and
lost
the
fight
he
advanced
his
first
objection
and
was
glad
to
see
the
expression
of
comprehension
on
face
it
would
be
putting
the
weapons
straight
into
red
hands
the
other
agreed
we
may
have
to
chance
it
before
we
through
manulito
warned
suppose
we
do
get
some
of
their
technicians
into
this
trap
that
going
to
open
up
their
main
defense
for
us
we
may
need
a
bigger
nutcracker
than
we
ever
seen
with
a
return
of
that
queasy
feeling
he
had
known
in
the
tower
travis
knew
manulito
was
speaking
sense
they
might
have
to
open
pandora
box
before
the
end
of
this
campaign
they
camped
another
two
days
near
the
wrecked
ship
while
manulito
prowled
the
haunted
corridors
and
cabins
in
his
space
suit
planning
his
booby
trap
at
night
he
drew
diagrams
on
pieces
of
bark
and
discussed
the
possibility
of
this
or
that
device
sometimes
lapsing
into
technicalities
his
companions
could
not
follow
but
travis
was
well
satisfied
that
manulito
knew
what
he
was
doing
on
the
morning
of
the
third
day
nolan
slipped
into
their
midst
he
was
his
face
gaunt
the
signs
of
hard
travel
plain
to
read
travis
handed
him
the
nearest
canteen
and
they
watched
him
drink
sparingly
in
small
sips
before
he
spoke
they
come
with
the
girl
you
had
trouble
asked
the
tatars
had
moved
their
camp
which
was
only
wise
since
the
reds
must
have
had
a
line
on
the
other
one
and
they
are
now
farther
to
the
west
but
he
wiped
his
lips
with
the
back
of
his
hand
also
we
saw
your
towers
fox
and
that
is
a
place
of
power
no
sign
that
the
reds
are
prowling
there
nolan
shook
his
head
to
my
mind
the
mists
there
conceal
the
towers
from
aerial
view
only
one
coming
on
foot
could
tell
them
from
the
natural
crags
of
the
hills
travis
relaxed
time
still
granted
them
a
margin
of
grace
he
glanced
up
to
see
nolan
smiling
faintly
this
maiden
she
is
a
kin
to
the
puma
of
the
mountains
he
announced
she
has
marked
tsoay
with
her
claws
until
he
looks
like
the
yearling
fresh
from
the
branding
chute
she
is
not
hurt
travis
demanded
this
time
nolan
chuckled
openly
hurt
no
we
had
much
to
do
to
keep
her
from
hurting
us
younger
brother
that
one
is
truly
as
she
claims
a
daughter
of
wolves
and
she
is
also
marking
a
return
trail
all
the
way
though
she
does
not
know
that
is
as
we
wish
did
we
not
pick
the
easiest
way
back
for
just
that
reason
yes
she
plans
to
escape
travis
stood
up
let
us
finish
this
quickly
his
voice
came
out
on
a
rough
note
this
plan
had
never
had
his
full
approval
now
he
found
it
less
and
less
easy
to
think
about
taking
kaydessa
into
the
ship
allowing
the
emotional
torment
lurking
there
to
work
upon
her
yet
he
knew
that
the
girl
would
not
be
hurt
and
he
had
made
sure
he
would
be
beside
her
within
the
globe
sharing
with
her
the
horror
of
the
unseen
a
rattling
of
gravel
down
the
narrow
valley
opening
gave
warning
to
those
by
the
campfire
manulito
had
already
stowed
the
space
suit
in
hiding
to
kaydessa
they
must
have
seemed
reverted
entirely
to
savagery
tsoay
came
first
an
angry
raking
of
four
parallel
scratches
down
his
left
cheek
and
behind
him
buck
and
eskelta
shoved
the
prisoner
urging
her
on
with
a
show
of
roughness
which
did
not
descend
to
actual
brutality
her
long
braids
had
shaken
loose
and
a
sleeve
was
torn
leaving
one
slender
arm
bare
but
none
of
the
fighting
spirit
had
left
her
they
thrust
her
out
into
the
circle
of
waiting
men
and
she
planted
her
feet
firmly
apart
glaring
at
them
all
indiscriminately
until
she
sighted
travis
then
her
anger
became
hotter
and
more
deadly
pig
rooter
in
the
dirt
diseased
camel
she
shouted
at
him
in
english
and
then
reverted
to
her
own
tongue
her
voice
riding
up
and
down
the
scale
her
hands
were
tied
behind
her
back
but
there
were
no
bonds
on
her
tongue
this
is
one
who
can
speak
thunders
and
shoot
lightnings
from
her
mouth
buck
commented
in
apache
put
her
well
away
from
the
wood
lest
she
set
it
aflame
tsoay
held
his
hands
over
his
ears
she
can
deafen
a
man
when
she
can
not
set
her
mark
on
him
otherwise
let
us
speedily
get
rid
of
her
yet
for
all
their
jeering
comments
their
eyes
held
respect
often
in
the
past
a
defiant
captive
who
stood
up
boldly
to
his
captors
had
received
more
consideration
than
usual
from
apache
warriors
courage
was
a
quality
they
prized
a
such
as
tom
jeffords
who
rode
into
cochise
camp
and
sat
in
the
midst
of
his
sworn
enemies
for
a
parley
won
the
friendship
of
the
very
chief
he
had
been
fighting
kaydessa
had
more
influence
with
her
captors
than
she
could
dream
of
holding
now
it
was
time
for
travis
to
play
his
part
he
caught
the
shoulder
and
pushed
her
before
him
toward
the
wreck
some
of
the
spirit
seemed
to
have
left
her
thin
tense
body
and
she
went
without
any
more
fight
only
when
they
came
into
full
view
of
the
ship
did
she
falter
travis
heard
her
breathe
a
gasp
of
surprise
as
they
had
planned
four
of
the
apaches
tsoay
nolan
and
buck
fanned
out
toward
the
heights
about
the
ship
manulito
had
already
gone
to
cover
to
don
the
space
suit
and
prepare
for
any
accident
resolutely
travis
continued
to
propel
kaydessa
ahead
at
the
moment
he
did
not
know
which
was
worse
to
enter
the
ship
expecting
the
fear
to
strike
or
to
meet
it
unprepared
he
was
ready
to
refuse
to
enter
not
to
allow
the
girl
sullenly
plodding
on
under
his
compulsion
to
face
that
unseen
but
potent
danger
only
the
memory
of
the
towers
and
the
threat
of
the
reds
finding
and
exploiting
the
treasure
there
kept
him
going
eskelta
went
first
climbing
to
the
tear
travis
cut
the
ropes
binding
kaydessa
wrists
and
gave
her
a
slight
slap
between
the
shoulders
climb
woman
his
anxiety
made
that
a
harsh
order
and
she
climbed
eskelta
was
inside
now
heading
for
the
cabin
which
might
reasonably
be
selected
as
a
prison
they
planned
to
get
the
girl
as
far
as
that
point
and
then
stage
their
act
of
being
overcome
by
fear
allowing
her
to
escape
stage
an
act
travis
was
not
two
feet
along
that
corridor
before
he
knew
that
there
would
be
little
acting
needed
on
his
part
the
thing
which
pervaded
the
ship
did
not
attack
sharply
rather
it
seeped
into
his
mind
and
body
as
if
he
drew
in
poison
with
every
breath
sent
it
racing
along
his
veins
with
every
beat
of
a
laboring
heart
yet
he
could
not
put
any
name
to
his
feelings
except
an
awful
weakening
fear
which
weighted
him
heavier
with
every
step
he
took
kaydessa
screamed
not
this
time
in
rage
but
with
such
fervor
that
travis
lost
his
hold
staggered
back
to
the
wall
she
whirled
about
her
face
contorted
and
sprang
at
him
it
was
indeed
like
trying
to
fight
a
wildcat
and
after
the
first
second
or
two
he
was
hard
put
to
protect
his
eyes
his
face
his
side
without
injuring
her
in
return
she
scrambled
over
him
running
for
the
break
in
the
wall
and
disappeared
travis
gasped
and
started
to
crawl
for
the
break
eskelta
loomed
over
him
pulled
him
up
in
haste
they
reached
the
opening
but
did
not
climb
through
travis
was
uncertain
as
to
whether
he
could
make
that
descent
yet
and
eskelta
was
obeying
orders
in
not
venturing
out
too
soon
below
the
ground
was
bare
there
was
no
sign
of
the
apaches
though
they
were
in
hiding
there
and
none
of
kaydessa
travis
was
amazed
that
she
had
vanished
so
quickly
still
uneasy
from
the
emanation
within
they
perched
within
the
shadow
of
the
break
until
travis
thought
that
the
fugitive
had
a
good
start
then
he
nodded
a
signal
to
eskelta
by
the
time
they
reached
ground
level
travis
felt
a
warm
wetness
spreading
under
his
shielding
palm
and
he
knew
the
wound
had
opened
he
spoke
a
word
or
two
in
hot
protest
against
that
mishap
knowing
it
would
keep
him
from
the
trail
kaydessa
must
be
covered
all
the
way
back
across
the
pass
not
only
to
be
shepherded
away
from
her
people
and
toward
the
plains
where
she
could
be
picked
up
by
a
red
patrol
but
also
to
keep
her
from
danger
and
he
had
planned
from
the
first
to
be
one
of
those
shepherds
now
he
was
about
as
much
use
as
a
pony
however
he
could
send
deputies
he
thought
out
his
call
and
head
appeared
in
a
frame
of
bush
go
both
of
you
and
run
with
her
guard
he
said
the
words
in
a
whisper
thought
them
with
a
fierce
intensity
as
he
centered
his
gaze
on
the
yellow
eyes
in
the
pointed
coyote
face
there
was
a
feeling
of
assent
and
then
the
animal
was
gone
travis
sighed
the
apache
scouts
were
subtle
and
alert
but
the
coyotes
could
far
outdo
any
man
with
and
naginlta
flanking
her
flight
kaydessa
would
be
well
guarded
she
would
probably
never
see
her
guards
or
know
that
they
were
running
protection
for
her
that
was
a
good
move
said
coming
out
of
concealment
but
what
have
you
done
to
yourself
he
stepped
closer
pulling
travis
hand
away
from
his
side
by
the
time
lupe
came
to
report
travis
was
again
wound
in
a
strapping
bandage
pulled
tightly
about
his
lower
ribs
and
reconciled
to
the
fact
that
any
trailing
he
would
do
must
be
well
to
the
rear
of
the
first
party
the
towers
he
said
to
if
our
plan
works
we
can
catch
part
of
the
reds
here
but
we
still
have
their
ship
to
take
and
for
that
we
need
help
which
we
may
find
at
the
towers
or
at
least
we
can
be
on
guard
there
if
they
return
with
kaydessa
on
that
path
lupe
dropped
down
lightly
from
an
upper
ledge
he
was
grinning
that
woman
is
one
who
thinks
she
runs
from
the
ship
first
as
a
rabbit
with
a
wolf
at
her
heels
then
she
begins
to
think
she
climbs
he
lifted
one
finger
to
the
slope
behind
them
she
goes
behind
a
rock
to
watch
under
cover
when
fox
comes
from
the
ship
with
eskelta
again
she
climbs
buck
lets
himself
be
seen
so
she
moves
east
as
we
wish
and
now
questioned
travis
she
is
keeping
to
the
high
ways
almost
she
thinks
like
one
of
the
people
on
the
war
trail
nolan
believes
she
will
hole
up
for
the
night
somewhere
above
he
will
make
sure
travis
licked
his
lips
she
has
no
food
or
water
lips
shaped
a
smile
they
will
see
that
she
comes
upon
both
as
if
by
chance
we
have
planned
all
of
this
as
you
know
younger
brother
that
was
true
travis
knew
that
kaydessa
would
be
guided
without
her
knowledge
by
the
accidental
appearance
now
and
then
of
some
pursuer
just
enough
to
push
her
along
then
too
she
is
now
armed
added
how
demanded
travis
look
to
your
own
belt
younger
brother
where
is
your
knife
startled
travis
glanced
down
his
sheath
was
empty
and
he
had
not
needed
that
blade
since
he
had
drawn
it
to
cut
meat
at
the
morning
meal
lupe
laughed
she
had
steel
in
her
hand
when
she
came
out
of
that
ghost
ship
took
it
from
me
while
we
struggled
travis
was
openly
surprised
he
had
considered
the
frenzy
displayed
by
the
tatar
girl
as
an
outburst
of
almost
mindless
terror
yet
kaydessa
had
had
wit
enough
to
take
his
knife
could
this
be
another
case
where
one
race
was
less
affected
by
a
mind
machine
than
the
other
just
as
the
apaches
had
not
been
governed
by
the
red
caller
so
the
tatars
might
not
be
as
sensitive
to
the
redax
she
is
a
strong
one
that
woman
one
worth
many
ponies
eskelta
reverted
to
the
old
measure
of
a
wife
value
that
is
true
travis
agreed
emphatically
and
then
was
annoyed
at
the
broadening
of
smile
abruptly
he
changed
the
subject
manulito
is
setting
the
booby
trap
in
the
ship
that
is
well
he
and
eskelta
will
remain
here
and
you
with
them
not
so
we
must
go
to
the
towers
travis
protested
i
thought
cut
in
that
you
believed
the
weapons
of
the
old
ones
too
dangerous
for
us
to
use
maybe
they
will
be
forced
into
our
hands
but
we
must
be
sure
the
towers
are
not
entered
by
the
reds
on
their
way
here
that
is
reasonable
but
for
you
younger
brother
no
trailing
today
perhaps
not
tomorrow
if
that
wound
opens
again
you
might
have
much
bad
trouble
travis
was
forced
to
accept
that
in
spite
of
his
worry
and
impatience
and
the
next
day
when
he
did
move
on
he
had
only
the
report
that
kaydessa
had
sheltered
beside
a
pool
for
the
night
and
was
doggedly
moving
back
across
the
mountains
three
days
later
travis
and
buck
came
into
the
tower
valley
kaydessa
was
in
the
northern
foothills
twice
turned
back
from
the
west
and
the
freedom
of
the
outlaws
by
the
apache
scouts
and
only
half
an
hour
before
tsoay
had
reported
by
mirror
what
should
have
been
welcome
news
the
red
helicopter
was
cruising
as
it
had
on
the
day
they
watched
the
hunters
enter
the
uplands
there
was
an
excellent
chance
of
the
fugitive
being
sighted
and
picked
up
soon
tsoay
had
also
spotted
a
party
of
three
tatars
watching
the
helicopter
but
after
one
wide
sweep
of
the
flyer
they
had
taken
to
their
ponies
and
ridden
away
at
the
fastest
pace
their
mounts
could
manage
in
this
rough
territory
on
a
stretch
of
smooth
earth
buck
scratched
a
trail
and
they
studied
it
the
reds
would
have
to
follow
this
route
to
seek
the
wrecked
ship
a
route
covered
by
apache
sentinels
and
following
the
chain
of
communication
the
result
of
the
trap
would
be
reported
to
the
party
at
the
towers
the
waiting
was
the
most
difficult
too
many
imponderables
did
not
allow
for
unemotional
thinking
travis
was
down
to
the
last
shred
of
patience
when
word
came
on
the
second
morning
at
the
hidden
valley
that
kaydessa
had
been
picked
up
by
a
red
patrol
drawn
out
to
meet
them
by
the
caller
now
the
tower
weapons
buck
answered
the
report
with
an
imperative
order
to
travis
and
the
other
knew
he
could
no
longer
postpone
the
inevitable
and
only
by
action
could
he
blot
out
the
haunting
mental
picture
of
kaydessa
once
more
drawn
into
the
bondage
she
so
hated
flanked
by
and
buck
he
climbed
back
through
the
tower
window
and
faced
the
glowing
pillar
he
crossed
the
room
put
out
both
hands
to
the
sleek
pole
uncertain
if
the
weird
transport
would
work
again
he
heard
the
sharp
gasp
from
the
others
as
his
body
was
sucked
against
the
pillar
and
carried
downward
through
the
well
buck
followed
him
and
came
last
then
travis
led
the
way
along
the
underground
corridor
to
the
room
with
the
table
and
the
reader
he
sat
down
on
the
bench
fumbled
with
the
pile
of
tape
disks
knowing
that
the
other
two
were
watching
him
with
almost
hostile
intentness
he
snapped
a
disk
into
the
reader
hoping
he
could
correctly
interpret
the
directions
it
gave
he
looked
up
at
the
wall
before
him
three
four
steps
the
correct
move
and
then
an
unlocking
you
know
buck
demanded
i
can
guess
well
moved
to
the
table
what
do
we
do
this
travis
came
from
behind
the
table
walked
to
the
wall
he
put
out
both
hands
flattened
his
palms
against
the
surface
and
slid
them
slowly
along
under
his
touch
the
material
of
the
wall
was
cool
and
hard
unlike
the
live
feel
the
pillar
had
cool
until
one
palm
held
at
arm
length
had
found
the
right
spot
he
slid
the
other
hand
along
in
the
opposite
direction
until
his
arms
were
level
with
his
shoulders
his
fingers
were
able
now
to
press
on
those
points
of
warmth
travis
tensed
and
pushed
hard
with
all
ten
fingers
at
first
as
one
second
and
then
two
passed
and
there
was
no
response
to
the
pressure
travis
thought
he
had
mistaken
the
reading
of
the
tape
then
directly
before
his
eyes
a
dark
line
cut
vertically
down
the
wall
he
applied
more
pressure
until
his
fingers
were
half
numb
with
effort
the
line
widened
slowly
finally
he
faced
a
slit
some
eight
feet
in
height
a
little
more
than
two
in
width
and
there
the
opening
remained
light
beyond
a
cold
gray
gleam
like
that
of
a
cloudy
winter
day
on
terra
and
with
it
the
chill
of
air
out
of
some
arctic
wasteland
favoring
his
still
bandaged
side
travis
scraped
through
the
door
ahead
of
the
others
and
came
into
the
place
of
gray
cold
wauggh
travis
heard
that
exclamation
from
could
have
echoed
it
himself
except
that
he
was
too
astounded
by
what
he
had
seen
to
say
anything
at
all
the
light
came
from
a
grid
of
bars
set
far
above
their
heads
into
the
native
rock
which
roofed
this
storehouse
for
storehouse
it
was
there
were
orderly
lines
of
boxes
some
large
enough
to
contain
a
tank
others
no
bigger
than
a
man
fist
symbols
in
the
same
lights
of
the
outer
wall
shone
from
their
sides
what
buck
began
one
question
and
then
changed
it
to
another
where
do
we
begin
to
look
toward
the
far
end
travis
started
down
the
center
aisle
between
rows
of
the
massed
spoils
of
another
time
and
world
or
worlds
the
same
tape
which
had
given
him
the
clue
to
the
unlocking
of
the
door
emphasized
the
importance
of
something
stored
at
the
far
end
an
object
or
objects
which
must
be
used
first
he
had
wondered
about
that
tape
a
sensation
of
urgency
almost
of
despair
had
come
through
the
gabble
of
alien
words
the
quick
sequence
of
diagrams
and
pictures
the
message
might
have
been
taped
under
a
threat
of
some
great
peril
there
was
no
dust
on
the
rows
of
boxes
or
on
the
floor
underfoot
a
current
of
cold
fresh
air
blew
at
intervals
down
the
length
of
the
huge
chamber
they
could
not
see
the
next
aisle
across
the
barriers
of
stored
goods
but
the
only
noise
was
a
whisper
and
the
faint
sounds
of
their
own
feet
they
came
out
into
an
open
space
backed
by
the
wall
and
travis
saw
what
had
been
so
important
no
his
protest
was
involuntary
but
his
denial
loud
enough
to
echo
six
six
of
them
tall
narrow
cases
set
upright
against
the
wall
and
from
their
depths
five
pairs
of
dark
eyes
staring
back
at
him
in
cold
measurement
these
were
the
men
of
the
ships
the
men
menlik
had
dreamed
of
their
bald
white
heads
their
thin
bodies
with
the
skintight
covering
of
the
familiar
five
of
them
were
here
alive
watching
waiting
five
men
and
six
boxes
that
small
fact
broke
the
spell
in
which
those
eyes
held
travis
he
looked
again
at
the
sixth
box
to
his
right
expecting
to
meet
another
pair
of
eyes
this
time
he
was
disconcerted
to
face
only
emptiness
then
as
his
gaze
traveled
downward
he
saw
what
lay
on
the
floor
there
a
skull
a
tangle
of
bones
tattered
material
cobwebbed
into
dusty
rags
by
time
whatever
had
preserved
five
of
the
star
men
intact
had
failed
the
sixth
of
their
company
they
are
alive
whispered
i
do
not
think
so
buck
answered
travis
took
another
step
reached
out
to
touch
the
transparent
front
of
the
nearest
coffin
case
there
was
no
change
in
the
eyes
of
the
alien
who
stood
within
no
indication
that
if
the
apaches
could
see
him
he
would
be
able
to
return
their
interest
the
five
stares
which
had
bemused
the
visitors
at
first
did
not
break
to
follow
their
movements
but
travis
knew
whether
it
was
some
message
on
the
tape
which
the
sight
of
the
sleepers
made
clear
or
whether
some
residue
of
the
driving
purpose
which
had
set
them
there
now
reached
his
mind
was
immaterial
he
knew
the
purpose
of
this
room
and
its
contents
why
it
had
been
made
and
the
reason
its
six
guardians
had
been
left
as
prisoners
and
what
they
wanted
from
anyone
coming
after
them
they
sleep
he
said
softly
sleep
buck
caught
him
up
they
sleep
in
something
like
deep
freeze
do
you
mean
they
can
be
brought
to
life
again
cried
maybe
not
now
it
must
be
too
long
but
they
were
meant
to
wait
out
a
period
and
be
restored
how
do
you
know
that
buck
asked
i
do
know
for
certain
but
i
think
i
understand
a
little
something
happened
a
long
time
ago
maybe
it
was
a
war
a
war
between
whole
star
systems
bigger
and
worse
than
anything
we
can
imagine
i
think
this
planet
was
an
outpost
and
when
the
supply
ships
did
come
any
more
when
they
knew
they
might
be
cut
off
for
some
length
of
time
they
closed
down
stacked
their
supplies
and
machines
here
and
then
went
to
sleep
to
wait
for
their
rescuers
for
rescuers
who
never
came
said
softly
and
there
is
a
chance
they
could
be
revived
even
now
travis
shivered
not
one
i
would
want
to
take
no
buck
tone
was
somber
that
i
agree
to
younger
brother
these
are
not
men
as
we
know
them
and
i
do
not
think
they
would
be
good
allies
they
had
in
plenty
these
star
men
but
it
is
not
the
power
of
the
people
no
one
but
a
madman
or
a
fool
would
try
to
disturb
this
sleep
of
theirs
the
truth
you
speak
agreed
but
where
in
this
he
turned
his
shoulder
to
the
sleeping
star
men
and
looked
back
at
the
filled
chamber
do
we
find
anything
which
will
serve
us
here
and
now
again
travis
had
only
the
scrappiest
information
to
draw
upon
spread
out
he
told
them
look
for
the
marking
of
a
circle
surrounding
four
dots
set
in
a
diamond
pattern
they
went
but
travis
lingered
for
a
moment
to
look
once
more
into
the
bleak
and
bitter
eyes
of
the
star
men
how
many
planet
years
ago
had
they
sealed
themselves
into
those
boxes
a
thousand
ten
thousand
their
empire
was
long
gone
yet
here
was
an
outpost
still
waiting
to
be
revived
to
carry
on
its
mysterious
duties
it
was
as
if
in
britain
long
ago
a
roman
garrison
had
been
frozen
to
await
the
return
of
the
legions
buck
was
right
there
was
no
common
ground
today
between
terran
man
and
these
unknowns
they
must
continue
to
sleep
undisturbed
yet
when
travis
also
turned
away
and
went
back
down
the
aisle
he
was
still
aware
of
a
persistent
pull
on
him
to
return
it
was
as
though
those
eyes
had
set
locking
cords
to
will
him
back
to
release
the
sleepers
he
was
glad
to
turn
a
corner
to
know
that
they
could
no
longer
watch
him
plunder
their
treasury
here
that
was
buck
voice
but
it
echoed
so
oddly
across
the
big
chamber
that
travis
had
difficulty
in
deciding
what
part
of
the
warehouse
it
was
coming
from
and
buck
had
to
call
several
times
before
travis
and
joined
him
there
was
the
symbol
shining
on
the
side
of
a
case
they
worked
it
out
of
the
pile
setting
it
in
the
open
travis
knelt
to
run
his
hands
along
the
top
the
container
was
an
unknown
alloy
tough
unmarked
by
the
years
perhaps
indestructible
again
his
fingers
located
what
his
eyes
could
not
detect
the
impressions
on
the
edge
oddly
shaped
impressions
into
which
his
finger
tips
did
not
fit
too
comfortably
he
pressed
bearing
down
with
the
full
strength
of
his
arms
and
shoulders
and
then
lifted
up
the
lid
the
apaches
looked
into
a
set
of
compartments
each
holding
an
object
with
a
barrel
a
hand
grip
a
general
resemblance
to
the
sidearms
of
their
own
world
and
time
but
sufficiently
different
to
point
up
the
essential
strangeness
with
infinite
care
travis
worked
one
out
of
the
which
held
it
the
weapon
was
light
in
weight
lighter
than
any
automatic
he
had
ever
held
its
barrel
was
long
a
good
eighteen
inches
the
grip
alien
in
shape
so
that
it
did
fit
comfortably
into
his
hand
the
trigger
nonexistent
but
in
its
place
a
button
on
the
lower
part
of
the
barrel
which
could
be
covered
by
an
outstretched
finger
what
does
it
do
asked
buck
practically
i
not
sure
but
it
is
important
enough
to
have
a
special
mention
on
the
tape
travis
passed
the
weapon
along
to
buck
and
worked
another
loose
from
its
holder
no
way
of
loading
i
can
see
buck
said
examining
the
weapon
with
care
and
caution
i
do
think
it
fires
a
solid
projectile
travis
replied
we
have
to
test
them
outside
to
find
out
just
what
we
do
have
the
apaches
took
only
three
of
the
weapons
closing
the
box
before
they
left
and
as
they
wriggled
back
through
the
crack
door
travis
was
visited
again
by
that
odd
flash
of
compelling
almost
possessive
power
he
had
experienced
when
they
had
lain
in
ambush
for
the
red
hunting
party
he
took
a
step
or
two
forward
until
he
was
able
to
catch
the
edge
of
the
reading
table
and
steady
himself
against
it
what
is
the
matter
both
buck
and
were
watching
him
apparently
neither
had
felt
that
sensation
travis
did
not
reply
for
a
second
he
was
free
of
it
now
but
he
was
sure
of
its
source
it
had
not
been
any
backlash
of
the
red
caller
it
was
rooted
here
a
compulsion
triggered
to
make
the
original
intentions
of
the
outpost
obeyed
a
last
drag
from
the
sleepers
this
place
had
been
set
up
with
a
single
purpose
to
protect
and
preserve
the
ancient
rulers
of
topaz
and
perhaps
the
very
presence
here
of
the
intruding
terrans
had
released
a
force
started
an
unseen
installation
now
travis
answered
simply
they
want
out
glanced
back
at
the
slit
door
but
buck
still
watched
travis
they
call
he
asked
in
a
way
travis
admitted
but
the
compulsion
had
already
ebbed
he
was
free
it
is
gone
now
this
is
not
a
good
place
buck
observed
somberly
we
touch
that
which
should
not
be
held
by
men
of
our
earth
he
held
out
the
weapon
did
not
the
people
take
up
the
rifles
of
the
for
their
defense
when
it
was
necessary
demanded
we
do
what
we
must
after
seeing
that
his
chin
indicated
the
slit
and
what
lay
behind
it
do
you
wish
the
reds
to
forage
here
still
buck
words
came
slowly
this
is
a
choice
between
two
evils
rather
than
between
an
evil
and
a
good
then
let
us
see
how
powerful
this
evil
is
headed
for
the
corridor
leading
to
the
pillar
it
was
late
afternoon
when
they
made
their
way
through
the
swirling
mists
of
the
valley
under
the
archway
giving
on
the
former
site
of
the
outlaw
tatar
camp
travis
sighted
the
long
barrel
of
the
weapon
at
a
small
bush
backed
by
a
boulder
and
he
pressed
the
firing
button
there
was
no
way
of
knowing
whether
the
weapon
was
loaded
except
to
try
it
the
result
of
his
action
was
quick
quick
and
terrifying
there
was
no
sound
no
sign
of
any
projectile
or
whatever
might
have
issued
in
answer
to
his
finger
movement
but
the
bush
the
bush
was
no
more
a
black
smear
made
a
ragged
outline
of
the
extinguished
branches
and
leaves
on
the
rock
which
had
stood
behind
the
earth
might
still
enclose
roots
under
a
thin
coating
of
ash
but
the
bush
was
gone
the
breath
of
powerful
beyond
belief
buck
broke
their
horrified
silence
first
in
truth
evil
is
here
raised
his
gun
if
gun
it
could
be
called
aimed
at
the
rock
with
the
bush
silhouette
plain
to
see
and
fired
this
time
they
were
able
to
witness
disintegration
in
progress
the
crumble
of
the
stone
as
if
its
substance
was
no
more
than
sand
lapped
by
river
water
a
pile
of
blackened
rubble
remained
nothing
more
to
use
this
on
a
living
thing
buck
protested
horror
basing
the
doubt
in
his
voice
we
do
not
use
it
against
living
things
travis
promised
but
against
the
ship
of
the
reds
to
cut
that
to
pieces
this
will
open
the
shell
of
the
turtle
and
let
us
at
its
meat
nodded
those
are
true
words
but
now
i
agree
with
your
fears
of
this
place
travis
this
is
a
devil
thing
and
must
not
be
allowed
to
fall
into
the
hands
of
those
who
will
use
it
more
freely
than
we
plan
to
buck
wanted
to
know
we
reserve
to
ourselves
that
right
because
we
hold
our
motives
higher
to
think
that
way
is
also
a
crooked
trail
we
will
use
this
means
because
we
must
but
afterward
afterward
that
warehouse
must
be
closed
the
tapes
giving
the
entrance
clue
destroyed
one
part
of
travis
fought
that
decision
right
though
he
knew
it
to
be
the
towers
were
the
menace
he
had
believed
and
what
was
more
discouraging
than
the
risk
they
now
ran
was
the
belief
that
the
treasure
was
a
poison
which
could
not
be
destroyed
but
which
might
spread
from
topaz
to
terra
suppose
the
western
conference
had
discovered
that
storehouse
and
explored
its
riches
would
they
have
been
any
less
eager
to
exploit
them
as
buck
had
pointed
out
one
own
ideals
could
well
supply
reasons
for
violence
in
the
past
terra
had
been
racked
by
wars
of
religion
one
fanatically
held
opinion
opposed
to
another
there
was
no
righteousness
in
such
struggles
only
fatal
ends
the
reds
had
no
right
to
this
new
knowledge
but
neither
did
they
it
must
be
locked
against
the
meddling
of
fools
and
zealots
taboo
buck
spoke
that
word
with
an
emphasis
they
could
appreciate
knowledge
must
be
set
behind
the
invisible
barriers
of
taboo
and
that
could
work
these
three
no
more
we
found
no
other
weapons
added
a
warning
suggestion
no
others
buck
agreed
and
travis
echoed
adding
we
found
tombs
of
the
space
people
and
these
were
left
with
them
because
of
our
great
need
we
borrowed
them
but
they
must
be
returned
to
the
dead
or
trouble
will
follow
and
they
may
only
be
used
against
the
fortress
of
the
reds
by
us
who
first
found
them
and
have
taken
unto
ourselves
the
wrath
of
disturbed
spirits
well
thought
that
is
an
answer
to
give
the
people
the
towers
are
the
tombs
of
dead
ones
when
we
return
these
they
shall
be
taboo
we
are
agreed
buck
asked
we
are
agreed
buck
tried
his
weapon
on
a
sapling
saw
it
vanish
into
nothingness
none
of
the
apaches
wanted
to
carry
the
strange
guns
against
their
bodies
the
power
made
them
objects
of
fear
rather
than
arms
to
delight
a
warrior
and
when
they
returned
to
their
temporary
camp
they
laid
all
three
on
a
blanket
and
covered
them
up
but
they
could
not
cover
up
the
memories
of
what
had
happened
to
bush
rock
and
tree
if
such
are
their
small
weapons
buck
observed
that
evening
then
what
kind
of
things
did
they
have
to
balance
our
heavy
armament
perhaps
they
were
able
to
burn
up
worlds
that
may
be
what
happened
elsewhere
travis
replied
we
do
not
know
what
put
an
end
to
their
empire
the
we
found
on
the
first
voyage
had
not
been
destroyed
but
it
had
been
evacuated
in
haste
one
building
had
not
even
been
stripped
of
its
furnishings
he
remembered
the
battle
he
had
fought
there
he
and
ross
murdock
and
the
winged
native
standing
up
to
an
attack
of
the
while
the
winged
warrior
had
used
his
physical
advantage
to
fly
above
and
bomb
the
enemies
with
boxes
snatched
from
the
piles
and
here
they
went
to
sleep
in
order
to
wait
out
some
danger
time
or
disaster
they
did
not
believe
would
be
permanent
buck
mused
travis
thought
he
would
flee
from
the
eyes
of
the
sleepers
throughout
his
dreams
that
night
but
on
the
contrary
he
slept
heavily
finding
it
hard
to
rouse
when
awakened
him
for
his
watch
but
he
was
alert
when
he
saw
a
shape
flit
out
of
the
shadows
drink
water
from
the
stream
and
shake
itself
vigorously
in
a
spray
of
drops
naginlta
he
greeted
the
coyote
trouble
he
could
have
shouted
that
question
but
he
put
a
tight
rein
on
his
impatience
and
strove
to
communicate
in
the
only
method
possible
no
what
the
coyote
had
come
to
report
was
not
trouble
but
the
fact
that
the
one
he
had
been
set
to
guard
was
headed
back
into
the
mountains
though
others
came
with
her
four
others
still
watched
their
camp
her
mate
had
come
for
further
orders
travis
squatted
before
the
animal
cupped
the
coyote
jowls
between
his
palms
naginlta
suffered
his
touch
with
only
a
small
whine
of
uneasiness
with
all
his
power
of
mental
suggestion
travis
strove
to
reach
the
keen
brain
he
knew
was
served
by
the
yellow
eyes
looking
into
his
the
others
with
kaydessa
were
to
be
led
on
taken
to
the
ship
but
kaydessa
must
not
suffer
harm
when
they
reached
a
spot
travis
thought
of
a
certain
rock
beyond
the
pass
then
one
of
the
coyotes
was
to
go
ahead
to
the
ship
let
the
apaches
there
know
manulito
and
eskelta
should
also
be
warned
by
the
sentry
along
the
peaks
but
additional
alerting
would
not
go
amiss
those
four
with
kaydessa
they
must
reach
the
trap
what
was
that
buck
rolled
out
of
his
blanket
naginlta
the
coyote
sped
back
into
the
dark
again
the
reds
have
taken
the
bait
a
party
of
at
least
four
with
kaydessa
are
moving
into
the
foothills
heading
south
but
the
enemy
party
was
not
the
only
one
on
the
move
in
the
light
of
day
a
sentry
mirror
from
a
point
in
the
peaks
sent
another
warning
down
to
their
camp
out
in
their
mountain
meadows
the
tatar
outlaws
were
on
horseback
moving
toward
the
entrance
of
the
tower
valley
buck
knelt
by
the
blanket
covering
the
alien
weapons
now
what
we
have
to
stop
them
travis
replied
but
he
had
no
idea
of
just
how
they
would
halt
those
determined
mongol
horsemen
there
were
ten
of
them
riding
on
small
wiry
steppe
ponies
men
and
women
both
and
well
armed
travis
recalled
it
was
the
custom
of
the
horde
that
the
women
fought
as
warriors
when
necessary
menlik
there
was
no
mistaking
the
flapping
robe
of
their
leader
and
they
were
singing
the
rider
behind
the
shaman
thumped
with
violent
energy
a
drum
fastened
beside
his
saddle
horn
its
heavy
boom
boom
the
same
call
the
apache
had
heard
before
the
mongols
were
working
themselves
into
the
mood
for
some
desperate
effort
travis
deduced
and
if
they
were
too
deeply
under
the
red
spell
there
would
be
no
arguing
with
them
he
could
wait
no
longer
the
apache
swung
down
from
a
ledge
near
the
valley
gate
moved
into
the
open
and
stood
waiting
the
alien
weapon
resting
across
his
forearm
if
necessary
he
intended
to
give
a
demonstration
with
it
for
an
object
lesson
the
war
cry
which
had
once
awakened
fear
across
a
quarter
of
terra
thin
here
and
from
only
a
few
throats
but
just
as
menacing
two
of
the
horsemen
aimed
lances
preparing
to
ride
him
down
travis
sighted
a
tree
midway
between
them
and
pressed
the
firing
button
this
time
there
was
a
flash
a
flicker
of
light
to
mark
the
disappearance
of
a
living
thing
one
of
the
lancers
ponies
reared
squealed
in
fear
the
other
kept
on
his
course
menlik
travis
shouted
hold
up
your
man
i
do
not
want
to
kill
the
shaman
called
out
but
the
lancer
was
already
level
with
the
vanished
tree
his
head
half
turned
on
his
shoulders
to
witness
the
blackened
earth
where
it
had
stood
then
he
dropped
his
lance
sawed
on
the
reins
a
rifle
bullet
might
not
have
halted
his
charge
unless
it
killed
or
wounded
but
what
he
had
just
seen
was
a
thing
beyond
his
understanding
the
tribesmen
sat
their
horses
facing
travis
watching
him
with
the
feral
eyes
of
the
wolves
they
claimed
as
forefathers
wolves
that
possessed
the
cunning
of
the
wild
cunning
enough
not
to
rush
breakneck
into
unknown
danger
travis
walked
forward
menlik
i
would
talk
there
was
an
outburst
from
the
horsemen
protests
from
hulagur
and
one
or
two
of
the
others
but
the
shaman
urged
his
mount
into
a
walking
pace
toward
the
apache
until
they
stood
only
a
few
feet
from
each
other
the
warrior
of
the
steppes
and
the
horde
facing
the
warrior
of
the
desert
and
the
people
you
have
taken
a
woman
from
our
yurts
menlik
said
but
his
eyes
were
more
on
the
alien
gun
than
on
the
man
who
held
it
brave
are
you
to
come
again
into
our
land
he
who
sets
foot
in
the
stirrup
must
mount
into
the
saddle
he
who
draws
blade
free
of
the
scabbard
must
be
prepared
to
use
it
the
horde
is
not
here
i
see
only
a
handful
of
people
travis
replied
does
menlik
propose
to
go
up
against
the
apaches
so
yet
there
are
those
who
are
his
greater
enemies
a
stealer
of
women
is
not
such
a
one
as
needs
a
regiment
under
a
general
to
face
him
suddenly
travis
was
impatient
of
the
ceremonious
talking
there
was
so
little
time
listen
and
listen
well
shaman
he
spoke
curtly
now
i
have
not
your
woman
she
is
already
crossing
the
mountains
southward
he
pointed
with
his
chin
leading
the
reds
into
a
trap
would
menlik
believe
him
there
was
no
need
travis
decided
to
tell
him
now
that
kaydessa
part
in
this
affair
was
involuntary
and
you
the
shaman
asked
the
question
the
apache
had
hoped
to
hear
travis
emphasized
that
march
now
against
those
hiding
behind
in
their
ship
out
there
he
indicated
the
northern
plains
menlik
raised
his
head
surveying
the
land
about
them
with
disbelieving
contemptuous
appraisal
you
are
chief
then
of
an
army
an
army
equipped
with
magic
to
overcome
machines
one
needs
no
army
when
he
carries
this
for
the
second
time
travis
displayed
the
power
of
the
weapon
he
carried
this
time
cutting
into
shifting
rubble
an
outcrop
of
cliff
wall
menlik
expression
did
not
change
though
his
eyes
narrowed
the
shaman
signaled
his
small
company
and
they
dismounted
travis
was
heartened
by
this
sign
that
menlik
was
willing
to
talk
the
apache
made
a
similar
gesture
and
and
buck
their
own
weapons
well
in
sight
came
out
to
back
him
travis
knew
that
the
tatar
had
no
way
of
knowing
that
the
three
were
alone
he
well
might
have
believed
an
unseen
troop
of
apaches
were
and
so
armed
you
would
talk
then
talk
menlik
ordered
this
time
travis
outlined
events
with
an
absence
of
word
embroidery
kaydessa
leads
the
reds
into
a
trap
we
have
set
beyond
the
peaks
four
of
them
ride
with
her
how
many
now
remain
in
the
ship
near
the
settlement
there
are
at
least
two
in
the
flyer
perhaps
eight
more
in
the
ship
but
there
is
no
getting
at
them
in
there
no
travis
laughed
softly
shifted
the
weapon
on
his
arm
do
you
not
think
that
this
will
crack
the
shell
of
that
nut
so
that
we
can
get
at
the
meat
menlik
eyes
flickered
to
the
left
to
the
tree
which
was
no
longer
a
tree
but
a
thin
deposit
of
ash
on
seared
ground
they
can
control
us
with
the
caller
as
they
did
before
if
we
go
up
against
them
then
we
are
once
more
gathered
into
their
net
before
we
reach
their
ship
that
is
true
for
you
of
the
horde
it
does
not
affect
the
people
travis
returned
and
suppose
we
burn
out
their
machines
then
will
you
not
be
free
to
burn
up
a
tree
lightning
from
the
skies
can
do
that
can
lightning
buck
asked
softly
also
make
rock
as
sand
of
the
river
menlik
eyes
turned
to
the
second
example
of
the
alien
weapon
power
give
us
proof
that
this
will
act
against
their
machines
what
proof
shaman
asked
shall
we
burn
down
a
mountain
that
you
may
believe
this
is
now
a
matter
of
time
travis
had
a
sudden
inspiration
you
say
that
the
is
out
suppose
we
use
that
as
a
target
that
that
can
sweep
the
flyer
from
the
sky
menlik
disbelief
was
open
travis
wondered
if
he
had
gone
too
far
but
they
needed
to
rid
themselves
of
that
spying
flyer
before
they
dared
to
move
out
into
the
plain
and
to
use
the
destruction
of
the
helicopter
as
an
example
would
be
the
best
proof
he
could
give
of
the
invincibility
of
the
new
apache
arms
under
the
right
conditions
he
replied
stoutly
yes
and
those
conditions
menlik
demanded
that
it
must
be
brought
within
range
say
below
the
level
of
a
neighboring
peak
where
a
man
may
lie
in
wait
to
fire
silent
apaches
faced
silent
mongols
and
travis
had
a
chance
to
taste
what
might
be
defeat
but
the
helicopter
must
be
taken
before
they
advanced
toward
the
ship
and
the
settlement
and
maker
of
traps
how
do
you
intend
to
bait
this
one
question
was
an
open
challenge
you
know
these
reds
better
than
we
travis
counterattacked
how
would
you
bait
it
son
of
the
blue
wolf
you
say
kaydessa
is
leading
the
reds
south
we
have
but
your
word
for
that
menlik
replied
though
how
it
would
profit
you
to
lie
on
such
a
matter
he
shrugged
if
you
do
speak
the
truth
then
the
will
circle
about
the
foothills
where
they
entered
and
what
would
bring
the
pilot
nosing
farther
in
the
apache
asked
menlik
shrugged
again
any
manner
of
things
the
reds
have
never
ventured
too
far
south
they
are
suspicious
of
the
heights
with
good
cause
his
fingers
near
the
hilt
of
his
tulwar
twitched
anything
which
might
suggest
that
their
party
is
in
difficulty
would
bring
them
in
for
a
closer
look
say
a
fire
with
much
smoke
suggested
menlik
spoke
over
his
shoulder
to
his
own
party
there
was
a
babble
of
answer
two
or
three
of
the
men
raising
their
voices
above
those
of
their
companions
if
set
in
the
right
direction
yes
the
shaman
conceded
when
do
you
plan
to
move
apaches
at
once
but
they
did
not
have
wings
and
the
march
they
had
to
make
was
a
rough
journey
on
foot
travis
at
once
stretched
into
night
hours
filled
with
scrambling
over
rocks
and
an
early
morning
of
preparations
with
always
the
threat
that
the
helicopter
might
not
return
to
fly
its
circling
mission
over
the
scene
of
operations
all
they
had
was
menlik
assurance
that
while
any
party
of
the
red
overlords
was
away
from
their
base
the
flyer
did
just
that
might
be
relaying
messages
on
from
a
or
something
like
that
buck
commented
they
should
reach
our
ship
in
two
days
three
at
the
most
if
they
are
pushing
travis
said
thoughtfully
it
would
be
a
help
if
that
flyer
is
a
link
in
any
com
unit
to
destroy
it
before
its
crew
picks
up
and
relays
any
report
of
what
happens
back
there
grunted
he
was
surveying
the
heights
above
the
pocket
in
which
menlik
and
two
of
the
mongols
were
piling
brush
there
there
and
there
the
apache
chin
made
three
juts
if
the
pilot
swoops
for
a
quick
look
our
cross
fire
will
take
out
his
blades
they
held
a
last
conference
with
menlik
and
then
climbed
to
the
perches
had
selected
sentries
on
lookout
reported
by
mirror
flash
that
tsoay
deklay
lupe
and
nolan
were
now
on
the
move
to
join
the
other
three
apaches
if
and
when
manulito
trap
closed
its
jaws
on
the
reds
at
the
western
ship
the
news
would
pass
and
the
apaches
would
move
out
to
storm
the
enemy
fort
on
the
prairie
and
should
they
blast
any
caller
the
helicopter
might
carry
menlik
and
his
riders
would
accompany
them
there
it
was
just
as
menlik
had
foretold
the
wasp
from
the
open
country
was
flying
into
the
hills
menlik
on
his
knees
struck
flint
to
steel
sparking
the
fire
they
hoped
would
draw
the
pilot
to
a
closer
investigation
the
brush
caught
and
smoke
thick
and
white
came
first
in
separate
puffs
and
then
gathered
into
a
murky
pillar
to
form
a
signal
no
one
could
overlook
in
travis
hands
the
grip
of
the
gun
was
slippery
he
rested
the
end
of
the
barrel
on
the
rock
curbing
his
rising
tension
as
best
he
could
to
escape
any
caller
on
the
flyer
the
tatars
had
remained
in
the
valley
below
the
apaches
lookout
and
as
the
helicopter
circled
in
travis
sighted
two
men
in
its
cockpit
one
wearing
a
helmet
identical
to
the
one
they
had
seen
on
the
red
hunter
days
ago
the
reds
long
undisputed
sway
over
the
mongol
forces
would
make
them
overconfident
travis
thought
that
even
if
they
sighted
one
of
the
waiting
apaches
they
would
not
take
warning
until
too
late
menlik
bush
fire
was
performing
well
and
the
flyer
was
heading
straight
for
it
the
machine
buzzed
the
smoke
once
too
high
for
the
apaches
to
trust
raying
its
blades
then
the
pilot
came
back
in
a
lower
sweep
which
carried
him
only
yards
above
the
smoldering
brush
on
a
level
with
the
snipers
travis
pressed
the
button
on
the
barrel
his
target
the
blades
momentum
carried
the
helicopter
on
but
at
least
one
of
the
marksmen
if
not
all
three
had
scored
the
machine
plowed
through
the
smoke
to
crack
up
beyond
was
their
caller
working
bringing
in
the
mongols
to
aid
the
reds
trapped
in
the
wreck
travis
watched
menlik
make
his
way
toward
the
machine
reach
the
cracked
cover
of
the
cockpit
but
in
the
shaman
hand
was
a
bare
blade
on
which
the
sun
glinted
the
mongol
wrenched
open
the
sprung
door
thrust
inward
with
the
tulwar
and
the
howl
of
triumph
he
voiced
was
as
worldless
and
wild
as
a
wolf
more
mongols
flooding
down
hulagur
a
woman
centering
on
the
helicopter
this
time
a
spear
plunged
into
the
interior
of
the
broken
flyer
payment
was
being
extracted
for
long
slavery
the
apaches
dropped
from
the
heights
waiting
for
menlik
to
leave
the
wild
scene
hulagur
had
dragged
out
the
body
of
the
helmeted
man
and
the
mongols
were
stripping
off
his
equipment
smashing
it
with
rocks
still
howling
their
war
cry
but
the
shaman
came
to
the
dying
smudge
fire
to
meet
the
apaches
he
was
smiling
his
upper
lip
raised
in
a
curve
suggesting
the
victory
purr
of
a
snow
tiger
and
he
saluted
with
one
hand
there
are
two
who
will
not
trap
men
again
we
believe
you
now
comrades
of
battle
when
you
say
you
can
go
up
against
their
fort
and
make
it
as
nothing
hulagur
came
up
behind
the
shaman
a
modern
automatic
in
his
hand
he
tossed
the
weapon
into
the
air
caught
it
again
laughing
disclaiming
something
in
his
own
language
from
the
serpents
we
take
two
fangs
menlik
translated
these
weapons
may
not
be
as
dangerous
as
yours
but
they
can
bite
deeper
quicker
and
with
more
force
than
our
arrows
it
did
not
take
the
mongols
long
to
strip
the
helicopter
and
the
reds
of
what
they
could
use
deliberately
smashing
all
the
other
equipment
which
had
survived
the
wreck
they
had
accomplished
one
important
move
the
link
between
the
southbound
exploring
party
and
the
red
headquarters
if
that
was
the
role
the
helicopter
had
played
was
now
gone
and
the
eyes
operating
over
the
open
territory
of
the
plains
had
ceased
to
exist
the
attacking
war
party
could
move
against
the
ship
near
the
red
settlement
knowing
they
had
only
controlled
mongol
scouts
to
watch
for
and
to
penetrate
enemy
territory
under
those
conditions
was
an
old
old
game
the
apaches
had
played
for
centuries
while
they
waited
for
the
signals
from
the
peaks
a
camp
was
established
and
a
mongol
dispatched
to
bring
up
the
rest
of
the
outlaws
and
all
extra
mounts
menlik
carried
to
the
apaches
a
portion
of
the
dried
meat
which
had
been
transported
horde
fashion
under
the
saddle
to
soften
it
for
eating
we
do
not
skulk
any
longer
like
rats
or
city
men
in
dark
holes
he
told
them
this
time
we
ride
and
we
shall
take
an
accounting
from
those
out
there
a
fine
accounting
they
still
have
other
controllers
travis
pointed
out
and
you
have
that
which
is
an
answer
to
all
their
machines
blazed
menlik
in
return
they
will
send
against
us
your
own
people
if
they
can
buck
warned
menlik
pulled
at
his
upper
lip
that
is
also
truth
but
now
they
have
no
eyes
in
the
sky
and
with
so
many
of
their
men
away
they
will
not
patrol
too
far
from
camp
i
tell
you
with
these
weapons
of
yours
a
man
could
rule
a
world
travis
looked
at
him
bleakly
which
is
why
they
are
taboo
taboo
menlik
repeated
in
what
manner
are
these
forbidden
do
you
not
carry
them
openly
use
them
as
you
wish
are
they
not
weapons
of
your
own
people
travis
shook
his
head
these
are
the
weapons
of
dead
men
if
we
can
name
them
men
at
all
these
we
took
from
a
tomb
of
the
star
race
who
held
topaz
when
our
world
was
only
a
hunting
ground
of
wild
men
wearing
the
skins
of
beasts
and
slaying
mammoths
with
stone
spears
they
are
from
a
tomb
and
are
cursed
a
curse
we
took
upon
ourselves
with
their
use
there
was
a
strange
light
deep
in
the
shaman
eyes
travis
did
not
know
who
or
what
menlik
had
been
before
the
red
conditioner
had
returned
him
to
the
role
of
horde
shaman
he
might
have
been
a
technician
or
scientist
and
deep
within
him
some
remnants
of
that
training
could
now
be
dismissing
everything
travis
said
as
fantastic
superstition
yet
in
another
way
the
apache
spoke
the
exact
truth
there
was
a
curse
on
these
weapons
on
every
bit
of
knowledge
gathered
in
that
warehouse
of
the
towers
as
menlik
had
already
noted
that
curse
was
power
the
power
to
control
topaz
and
then
perhaps
to
reach
back
across
the
stars
to
terra
when
the
shaman
spoke
again
his
words
were
a
half
whisper
it
will
take
a
powerful
curse
to
keep
these
out
of
the
hands
of
men
with
the
reds
gone
or
powerless
buck
asked
what
need
will
anyone
have
for
them
and
if
another
ship
comes
from
the
skies
to
begin
all
over
again
to
that
we
shall
have
an
answer
also
if
and
when
we
must
find
it
travis
replied
that
could
well
be
true
other
weapons
in
the
warehouse
powerful
enough
to
pluck
a
spaceship
out
of
the
sky
but
they
did
not
have
to
worry
about
that
now
arms
from
a
tomb
yes
this
is
truly
dead
men
magic
i
shall
say
so
to
my
people
when
do
we
move
out
when
we
know
whether
or
not
the
trap
to
the
south
is
sprung
buck
answered
the
report
came
an
hour
after
sunrise
the
next
morning
when
tsoay
nolan
and
deklay
padded
into
camp
the
war
chief
made
a
slight
gesture
with
one
hand
it
is
done
travis
wanted
confirmation
in
words
it
is
done
the
entered
the
ship
eagerly
then
they
blew
it
and
themselves
up
manulito
did
his
work
well
and
kaydessa
the
woman
is
safe
when
the
reds
saw
the
ship
they
left
their
machine
outside
to
hold
her
captive
that
mechanical
caller
was
easily
destroyed
she
is
now
free
and
with
the
she
comes
across
the
mountains
manulito
and
eskelta
with
her
also
now
he
looked
from
his
own
people
to
the
mongols
why
are
you
here
with
these
we
wait
but
the
waiting
is
over
said
now
we
go
north
they
lay
along
the
rim
of
a
vast
basin
a
scooping
out
of
earth
so
wide
they
could
not
sight
its
other
side
the
bed
of
an
ancient
lake
travis
speculated
or
perhaps
even
the
arm
of
a
sea
but
now
the
hollow
was
filled
with
rolling
waves
of
golden
grass
tossing
heavy
heads
under
the
flowing
touch
of
a
breeze
with
the
exception
of
a
space
about
a
mile
ahead
where
round
domes
black
gray
brown
broke
the
yellow
in
an
irregular
oval
around
the
globular
silver
bead
of
a
spacer
a
larger
ship
than
that
which
had
brought
the
apaches
but
of
the
same
shape
the
horse
herd
to
the
west
nolan
evaluated
the
scene
with
the
eyes
of
an
experienced
raider
tsoay
deklay
you
take
the
horses
they
nodded
and
began
the
long
crawl
which
would
take
them
two
miles
or
more
from
the
party
to
stampede
the
horses
to
the
mongols
in
those
domelike
yurts
horses
were
wealth
life
itself
they
would
come
running
to
investigate
any
disturbance
among
the
grazing
ponies
thus
clearing
the
path
to
the
ship
and
the
reds
there
travis
and
buck
armed
with
the
star
guns
would
spearhead
that
attack
cutting
into
the
substance
of
the
ship
itself
until
it
was
a
sieve
through
which
they
could
shake
out
the
enemy
only
when
the
installations
it
contained
were
destroyed
might
the
apaches
hope
for
any
assistance
from
the
mongols
either
the
outlaw
pack
waiting
well
back
on
the
prairie
or
the
people
in
the
yurts
the
grass
rippled
and
naginlta
poked
out
a
nose
parting
stems
before
travis
the
apache
beamed
an
order
sending
the
coyotes
with
the
party
he
had
seen
how
the
animals
could
drive
hunted
they
would
do
as
well
with
the
ponies
kaydessa
was
safe
the
coyotes
had
made
that
clear
by
the
fact
that
they
had
joined
the
attacking
party
an
hour
earlier
with
eskelta
and
manulito
she
was
on
her
way
back
to
the
north
travis
supposed
he
should
be
well
pleased
that
their
reckless
plan
had
succeeded
as
well
as
it
had
but
when
he
thought
of
the
tatar
girl
all
he
could
see
was
her
convulsed
face
close
to
his
in
the
ship
corridor
her
raking
nails
raised
to
tear
his
cheek
she
had
an
excellent
reason
to
hate
him
yet
he
hoped
they
continued
to
watch
both
horse
herd
and
domes
there
were
people
moving
about
the
yurts
but
no
signs
of
life
at
the
ship
had
the
reds
shut
themselves
in
there
warned
in
some
way
of
the
two
disasters
which
had
whittled
down
their
forces
ah
nolan
breathed
one
of
the
ponies
had
raised
its
head
and
was
facing
the
direction
of
the
camp
suspicion
plain
to
read
in
its
stance
the
apaches
must
have
reached
the
point
between
the
herd
and
the
domes
which
had
been
their
goal
and
the
mongol
guard
who
had
been
sitting
the
reins
of
his
mount
dangling
close
to
his
hand
got
to
his
feet
ahhhuuuuu
the
ancient
apache
war
cry
that
had
sounded
across
deserts
canyons
and
southwestern
terran
plains
to
ice
the
blood
ripped
just
as
freezingly
through
the
air
of
topaz
the
horses
wheeled
racing
upslope
away
from
the
settlement
a
figure
broke
from
the
grass
flapped
his
arms
at
one
of
the
mounts
grabbed
at
flying
mane
and
pulled
himself
up
on
the
bare
back
only
a
master
horseman
would
have
done
that
but
the
whooping
rider
now
drove
the
herd
on
assisted
by
the
snapping
and
snarling
coyotes
deklay
identified
the
reckless
rider
that
was
one
of
his
rodeo
tricks
among
the
yurts
it
was
as
if
someone
had
ripped
up
a
rotten
log
to
reveal
an
ants
nest
and
sent
the
alarmed
insects
into
a
frenzy
men
boiled
out
of
the
domes
the
majority
of
them
running
for
the
horse
pasture
one
or
two
were
mounted
on
ponies
that
must
have
been
staked
out
in
the
settlement
the
main
war
party
of
apaches
skimmed
silently
through
the
grass
on
their
way
to
the
ship
the
three
who
were
armed
with
the
alien
weapons
had
already
tested
their
range
by
experimentation
back
in
the
hills
but
the
fear
of
exhausting
whatever
powered
those
barrels
had
curtailed
their
target
practice
now
they
snaked
to
the
edge
of
the
bare
ground
between
them
and
the
ladder
hatch
of
the
spacer
to
cross
that
open
space
was
to
provide
targets
for
lances
and
arrows
or
the
superior
armament
of
the
reds
a
chance
we
can
hit
from
here
buck
laid
his
weapon
across
his
bent
knee
steadied
the
long
barrel
of
the
burner
and
pressed
the
firing
button
the
closed
hatch
of
the
ship
shimmered
dissolved
into
a
black
hole
behind
travis
someone
let
out
the
yammer
of
a
war
whoop
fire
cut
the
walls
to
pieces
travis
did
not
need
that
order
from
he
was
already
beaming
unseen
destruction
at
the
best
target
he
could
ask
for
the
side
of
the
sphere
if
the
globe
was
armed
there
was
no
weapon
which
could
be
depressed
far
enough
to
reach
the
marksmen
at
ground
level
holes
appeared
irregular
gaps
and
tears
in
the
fabric
of
the
ship
the
apaches
were
turning
the
side
of
the
globe
into
lacework
how
far
those
rays
penetrated
into
the
interior
they
could
not
guess
movement
at
one
of
the
holes
the
chattering
burst
of
fire
spatters
of
soil
and
gravel
into
their
faces
they
could
be
cut
to
pieces
by
that
the
hole
enlarged
a
scream
cut
off
they
will
not
be
too
quick
to
try
that
again
nolan
observed
with
cold
calm
from
behind
travis
post
methodically
they
continued
to
beam
the
ship
it
would
never
be
again
there
were
neither
the
skills
nor
materials
here
to
repair
such
damage
it
is
like
laying
a
knife
to
fat
lupe
said
as
he
crawled
up
beside
travis
slice
slice
move
travis
reached
to
the
left
pulled
at
shoulder
travis
did
not
know
whether
it
was
possible
or
not
but
he
had
a
heady
vision
of
their
combined
fire
power
cutting
the
globe
in
half
slicing
it
crosswise
with
the
ease
lupe
admired
they
scurried
through
cover
just
as
someone
behind
yelled
a
warning
travis
threw
himself
down
rolled
into
a
new
firing
position
an
arrow
sang
over
his
head
the
reds
were
doing
what
the
apaches
had
known
they
would
calling
in
the
controlled
mongols
to
fight
the
attack
on
the
ship
must
be
stepped
up
or
the
amerindians
would
be
forced
to
retreat
already
a
new
lacing
of
holes
appeared
under
their
concentrated
efforts
with
the
gun
held
tight
to
his
middle
travis
found
his
feet
zigzagged
across
the
bare
ground
for
the
nearest
of
those
openings
another
arrow
clanged
harmlessly
against
the
fabric
of
the
ship
a
foot
from
his
goal
he
made
it
in
over
jagged
metal
shards
which
glowed
faintly
and
reeked
of
ozone
the
weapons
beams
had
penetrated
well
past
both
the
outer
shell
and
the
wall
of
insulation
webbing
he
climbed
a
second
and
smaller
break
into
a
corridor
enough
like
those
of
the
western
ship
to
be
familiar
the
red
spacer
based
on
the
general
plan
of
the
alien
derelict
ship
as
his
own
had
been
could
not
be
very
different
travis
tried
to
subdue
his
heavy
breathing
and
listen
he
heard
a
confused
shouting
and
the
burr
of
what
might
be
an
alarm
system
the
ship
brain
was
the
control
cabin
even
if
the
reds
dared
not
try
to
lift
now
that
was
the
core
of
their
communication
lines
he
started
along
the
corridor
trying
to
figure
out
its
orientation
in
relation
to
that
nerve
center
the
apache
shoved
open
each
door
he
passed
with
one
shoulder
and
twice
he
played
a
light
beam
on
installations
within
cabins
he
had
no
idea
of
their
use
but
the
wholesale
destruction
of
each
and
every
machine
was
what
good
sense
and
logic
dictated
there
was
a
sound
behind
travis
whirled
saw
and
beyond
him
buck
up
asked
and
down
buck
added
the
tatars
say
they
have
hollowed
a
bunker
beneath
separate
and
do
as
much
damage
as
you
can
travis
suggested
agreed
travis
sped
on
he
passed
another
door
and
then
backtracked
hurriedly
as
he
realized
it
had
given
on
to
an
engine
room
with
the
gun
he
blasted
two
long
lines
cutting
the
fittings
into
ragged
lumps
abruptly
the
lights
went
out
the
burr
of
the
alarms
was
silenced
part
of
the
ship
if
not
all
was
dead
and
now
it
might
come
to
hunter
and
hunted
in
the
dark
but
that
was
an
advantage
as
far
as
the
apaches
were
concerned
back
in
the
corridor
again
travis
crept
through
a
curiously
lifeless
atmosphere
the
shouting
was
stilled
as
if
the
sudden
failure
of
the
machines
had
stunned
the
reds
a
tiny
sound
perhaps
the
scrape
of
a
boot
on
a
ladder
travis
edged
back
into
a
compartment
a
flash
of
light
momentarily
lighted
the
corridor
the
approaching
figure
was
using
a
torch
travis
drew
his
knife
with
one
hand
reversed
it
so
he
could
use
the
heavy
hilt
as
a
silencer
the
other
was
hurrying
now
on
his
way
to
investigate
the
engine
cabin
travis
could
hear
the
rasp
of
his
fast
breathing
now
the
apache
had
put
down
the
gun
his
left
arm
closed
about
a
shoulder
and
the
red
gasped
as
travis
struck
with
the
knife
hilt
not
clean
he
had
to
hit
a
second
time
before
the
struggles
of
the
man
were
over
then
using
his
hands
for
eyes
he
stripped
the
limp
body
on
the
floor
of
automatic
and
torch
with
the
red
weapon
in
the
front
of
his
sash
the
burner
in
one
hand
and
the
torch
in
the
other
travis
prowled
on
there
was
a
good
chance
that
those
above
might
believe
him
to
be
their
comrade
returning
he
found
the
ladder
leading
to
the
next
level
began
to
climb
pausing
now
and
then
to
listen
shock
preceded
sound
under
him
the
ladder
swayed
and
the
globe
itself
rocked
a
little
a
blast
of
some
kind
must
have
been
set
off
at
or
under
the
level
of
the
ground
the
bunker
buck
had
mentioned
travis
clung
to
the
ladder
waited
for
the
vibrations
to
subside
there
was
a
shouting
above
a
questioning
hurriedly
he
ascended
to
the
next
level
scrambled
out
and
away
from
the
ladder
just
in
time
to
avoid
the
light
from
another
torch
flashed
down
the
well
again
that
call
of
inquiry
then
a
shot
the
boom
of
the
explosion
loud
in
the
confined
space
to
climb
into
the
face
of
that
light
with
a
waiting
marksman
above
was
sheer
folly
could
there
be
another
way
up
travis
retreated
down
one
of
the
corridors
raying
out
from
the
ladder
well
a
quick
inspection
of
the
cabins
along
that
route
told
him
he
had
reached
a
section
of
living
quarters
the
pattern
was
familiar
the
control
cabin
would
be
on
the
next
level
suddenly
the
apache
remembered
something
on
each
level
there
should
be
an
emergency
opening
giving
access
to
the
insulation
space
between
the
inner
and
outer
skins
of
the
ship
through
which
repairs
could
be
made
if
he
could
find
that
and
climb
up
to
the
next
level
the
light
shining
down
the
well
remained
steady
and
there
was
the
echoing
crack
of
another
shot
but
travis
was
far
enough
away
from
the
ladder
now
to
dare
use
his
own
torch
seeking
the
door
he
needed
on
the
wall
surface
with
a
leap
of
heart
he
sighted
the
outline
his
luck
was
in
the
russian
and
western
ships
were
alike
once
the
panel
was
open
he
flashed
his
torch
up
finding
the
climbing
rungs
and
above
the
shadow
outline
of
the
next
level
opening
securing
the
alien
gun
in
his
sash
beside
the
automatic
and
holding
the
torch
in
his
mouth
travis
climbed
not
daring
to
think
of
the
deep
drop
below
four
five
ten
rungs
and
he
could
reach
the
other
door
his
fingers
slid
over
it
searching
for
the
release
catch
but
there
was
no
answering
give
balling
his
fist
he
struck
down
at
an
awkward
angle
and
almost
lost
his
balance
as
the
panel
fell
away
beneath
his
blow
the
door
swung
and
he
pulled
through
darkness
travis
snapped
on
the
torch
for
an
instant
saw
about
him
the
relays
of
a
com
system
and
gave
it
a
full
spraying
as
he
pivoted
destroying
the
eyes
and
ears
of
the
ship
unless
the
burnout
he
had
effected
below
had
already
done
that
a
flash
of
automatic
fire
from
his
left
a
searing
burn
along
his
arm
an
inch
or
so
below
the
shoulder
travis
action
was
purely
reflex
he
swung
the
burner
around
even
as
his
mind
gave
a
frantic
no
to
defend
himself
with
automatic
knife
arrow
yes
but
not
this
way
he
huddled
against
the
wall
an
instant
earlier
there
had
been
a
man
there
a
living
breathing
man
one
of
his
own
species
if
not
of
his
own
beliefs
then
because
his
own
muscles
had
unconsciously
obeyed
warrior
training
there
was
this
so
easy
to
deal
death
without
really
meaning
to
the
weapon
in
his
hands
was
truly
the
devil
gift
they
were
right
to
fear
such
weapons
were
not
to
be
put
into
the
hands
of
men
any
men
no
matter
how
well
intentioned
travis
gulped
in
great
mouthfuls
of
air
he
wanted
to
throw
the
burner
away
hurl
it
from
him
but
the
task
he
could
rightfully
use
it
for
was
not
yet
done
somehow
he
reeled
on
into
the
control
cabin
to
render
the
ship
truly
a
dead
thing
and
free
himself
of
the
heavy
burden
of
guilt
and
terror
between
his
hands
that
weight
could
be
laid
aside
memory
could
not
and
no
one
of
his
kind
must
ever
have
to
carry
such
memories
again
the
booming
of
the
drums
was
like
a
pulse
quickening
the
blood
to
a
rhythm
which
bit
at
the
brain
made
a
man
eyes
shine
his
muscles
tense
as
if
he
held
an
arrow
to
bow
cord
or
arched
his
fingers
about
a
knife
hilt
a
fire
blazed
high
and
in
its
light
men
leaped
and
whirled
in
a
mad
dance
with
tulwar
blades
catching
and
reflecting
the
red
gleam
of
flames
mad
wild
the
mongols
were
drunk
with
victory
and
freedom
beyond
them
the
silver
globe
of
the
ship
showed
the
black
holes
of
its
death
which
was
also
the
death
of
the
past
for
all
of
them
what
now
menlik
the
dangling
of
amulets
and
charms
tinkling
as
he
moved
came
up
to
travis
there
was
none
of
the
wild
fervor
in
the
shaman
face
instead
it
was
as
if
he
had
taken
several
strides
out
of
the
life
of
the
horde
was
emerging
into
another
person
and
the
question
he
asked
was
one
they
all
shared
travis
felt
drained
flattened
they
had
achieved
their
purpose
the
handful
of
red
overlords
were
dead
their
machines
burned
out
there
were
no
controls
here
any
more
men
were
free
in
mind
and
body
what
were
they
to
do
with
that
freedom
first
the
apache
spoke
his
own
thoughts
we
must
return
these
the
three
alien
weapons
were
lashed
into
a
square
of
mongol
fabric
hidden
from
sight
although
they
could
not
be
so
easily
shut
out
of
mind
only
a
few
of
the
others
apache
or
mongol
had
seen
them
and
they
must
be
returned
before
their
power
was
generally
known
i
wonder
if
in
days
to
come
buck
mused
they
will
not
say
that
we
pulled
lightning
out
of
the
sky
as
did
the
thunder
slayer
to
aid
us
but
this
is
right
we
must
return
them
and
make
that
valley
and
what
it
holds
taboo
and
what
if
another
ship
comes
one
of
menlik
asked
shrewdly
travis
stared
beyond
the
tatar
shaman
to
the
men
about
the
fire
his
nightmare
dragged
into
the
open
what
if
a
ship
did
come
in
one
with
ashe
murdock
men
he
knew
and
liked
friends
on
board
what
then
of
his
guardianship
of
the
towers
and
their
knowledge
could
he
be
as
sure
of
what
to
do
then
he
rubbed
his
hand
across
his
forehead
and
said
slowly
we
shall
take
steps
when
or
if
that
happens
but
could
they
would
they
he
began
to
hope
fiercely
that
it
would
not
happen
at
least
in
his
lifetime
and
then
felt
the
cold
bleakness
of
the
exile
they
must
will
themselves
into
whether
we
like
it
or
not
was
he
talking
to
the
others
or
trying
to
argue
down
his
own
rebellion
we
can
not
let
what
lies
under
the
towers
be
known
found
used
unless
by
men
who
are
wiser
and
more
controlled
than
we
are
in
our
time
menlik
drew
his
shaman
wand
twiddled
it
between
his
fingers
and
beneath
his
drooping
lids
watched
the
three
apaches
with
a
new
kind
of
measurement
then
i
say
to
you
this
such
a
guardianship
must
be
a
double
charge
shared
by
my
people
as
well
for
if
they
suspect
that
you
alone
control
these
powers
and
their
secret
there
will
be
envy
hatred
fear
a
division
between
us
from
the
first
war
raids
this
is
a
large
land
and
neither
of
our
groups
numbers
many
shall
we
split
apart
fatally
from
this
day
when
there
is
room
for
all
if
these
ancient
things
are
evil
then
let
us
both
guard
them
with
a
common
taboo
he
was
right
of
course
and
they
would
have
to
face
the
truth
squarely
to
both
apache
and
mongol
any
ship
no
matter
from
which
side
would
be
a
menace
here
was
where
they
would
remain
and
set
roots
the
sooner
they
began
thinking
of
themselves
as
people
with
a
common
bond
the
better
it
would
be
and
menlik
suggestion
provided
a
tie
you
speak
well
buck
was
saying
this
shall
be
a
thing
we
share
we
are
three
who
know
do
you
be
three
also
but
choose
well
menlik
be
assured
that
i
will
the
tatar
returned
we
start
a
new
life
here
there
is
no
going
back
but
as
i
have
said
the
land
is
wide
we
have
no
quarrel
with
one
another
and
perhaps
our
two
peoples
shall
become
one
after
all
we
do
not
differ
too
greatly
he
smiled
and
gestured
to
the
fire
and
the
dancers
among
the
mongols
another
man
had
gone
into
action
his
head
thrown
back
as
he
leaped
and
twirled
voicing
a
deep
war
cry
travis
recognized
deklay
apache
mongol
both
raiders
horsemen
hunters
fighters
when
the
need
arose
no
there
was
no
great
difference
both
had
been
tricked
into
coming
here
and
they
had
no
allegiance
now
for
those
who
had
sent
them
perhaps
clan
and
horde
would
combine
or
perhaps
they
would
drift
apart
time
would
tell
but
there
would
be
the
bond
of
the
guardianship
the
determination
that
what
slept
in
the
towers
would
not
be
roused
in
their
lifetime
or
many
lifetimes
travis
smiled
a
bit
crookedly
a
new
religion
of
sorts
a
priesthood
with
sacred
and
forbidden
knowledge
in
time
a
whole
new
life
and
civilization
stemming
from
this
night
the
bleak
cold
of
his
early
thought
cut
less
deep
there
was
a
different
kind
of
adventure
here
he
reached
out
and
gathered
up
the
bundle
of
the
burners
glancing
from
buck
to
to
menlik
then
he
stood
up
the
weight
of
the
burden
in
his
arms
the
feeling
of
a
greater
weight
inside
him
shall
we
go
to
get
the
weapons
back
that
was
of
first
importance
maybe
then
he
could
sleep
soundly
to
dream
of
riding
across
the
arizona
range
at
dawn
under
a
blue
sky
with
a
wind
in
his
face
a
wind
carrying
the
scent
of
piñon
pine
and
sage
a
wind
which
would
never
caress
or
hearten
him
again
a
wind
his
sons
and
sons
sons
would
never
know
to
dream
troubled
dreams
and
hope
in
time
those
dreams
would
fade
and
thin
that
a
new
world
would
blanket
out
the
old
better
so
travis
told
himself
with
defiance
and
determination
better
so
