i
a
discovery
i
am
not
an
inquisitive
woman
but
when
in
the
middle
of
a
certain
warm
night
in
september
i
heard
a
carriage
draw
up
at
the
adjoining
house
and
stop
i
could
not
resist
the
temptation
of
leaving
my
bed
and
taking
a
peep
through
the
curtains
of
my
window
first
because
the
house
was
empty
or
supposed
to
be
so
the
family
still
being
as
i
had
every
reason
to
believe
in
europe
and
secondly
because
not
being
inquisitive
i
often
miss
in
my
lonely
and
single
life
much
that
it
would
be
both
interesting
and
profitable
for
me
to
know
luckily
i
made
no
such
mistake
this
evening
i
rose
and
looked
out
and
though
i
was
far
from
realizing
it
at
the
time
took
by
so
doing
my
first
step
in
a
course
of
inquiry
which
has
ended
but
it
is
too
soon
to
speak
of
the
end
rather
let
me
tell
you
what
i
saw
when
i
parted
the
curtains
of
my
window
in
gramercy
park
on
the
night
of
september
not
much
at
first
glance
only
a
common
hack
drawn
up
at
the
neighboring
the
lamp
which
is
supposed
to
light
our
part
of
the
block
is
some
rods
away
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
street
so
that
i
obtained
but
a
shadowy
glimpse
of
a
young
man
and
woman
standing
below
me
on
the
pavement
i
could
see
however
that
the
woman
and
not
the
man
was
putting
money
into
the
driver
hand
the
next
moment
they
were
on
the
stoop
of
this
house
and
the
coach
rolled
off
it
was
dark
as
i
have
said
and
i
did
not
recognize
the
young
people
at
least
their
figures
were
not
familiar
to
me
but
when
in
another
instant
i
heard
the
click
of
a
and
saw
them
after
a
rather
tedious
fumbling
at
the
lock
disappear
from
the
stoop
i
took
it
for
granted
that
the
gentleman
was
van
burnam
eldest
son
franklin
and
the
lady
some
relative
of
the
family
though
why
this
its
most
punctilious
member
should
bring
a
guest
at
so
late
an
hour
into
a
house
devoid
of
everything
necessary
to
make
the
least
exacting
visitor
comfortable
was
a
mystery
that
i
retired
to
bed
to
meditate
upon
i
did
not
succeed
in
solving
it
however
and
after
some
ten
minutes
had
elapsed
i
was
settling
myself
again
to
sleep
when
i
was
by
a
fresh
sound
from
the
quarter
mentioned
the
door
i
had
so
lately
heard
shut
opened
again
and
though
i
had
to
rush
for
it
i
succeeded
in
getting
to
my
window
in
time
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
departing
figure
of
the
young
man
hurrying
away
towards
broadway
the
young
woman
was
not
with
him
and
as
i
realized
that
he
had
left
her
behind
him
in
the
great
empty
house
without
apparent
light
and
certainly
without
any
companion
i
began
to
question
if
this
was
like
franklin
van
burnam
was
it
not
more
in
keeping
with
the
recklessness
of
his
more
and
less
reliable
brother
howard
who
some
two
or
three
years
back
had
married
a
young
wife
of
no
very
satisfactory
antecedents
and
who
as
i
had
heard
had
been
ostracized
by
the
family
in
consequence
whichever
of
the
two
it
was
he
had
certainly
shown
but
little
consideration
for
his
companion
and
thus
thinking
i
fell
off
to
sleep
just
as
the
clock
struck
the
half
hour
after
midnight
next
morning
as
soon
as
modesty
would
permit
me
to
approach
the
window
i
surveyed
the
neighboring
house
minutely
not
a
blind
was
open
nor
a
shutter
displaced
as
i
am
an
early
riser
this
did
not
disturb
me
at
the
time
but
when
after
breakfast
i
looked
again
and
still
failed
to
detect
any
evidences
of
life
in
the
great
barren
front
beside
me
i
began
to
feel
uneasy
but
i
did
nothing
till
noon
when
going
into
my
rear
garden
and
observing
that
the
back
windows
of
the
van
burnam
house
were
as
closely
shuttered
as
the
front
i
became
so
anxious
that
i
stopped
the
next
policeman
i
saw
going
by
and
telling
him
my
suspicions
urged
him
to
ring
the
bell
no
answer
followed
the
summons
there
is
no
one
here
said
he
ring
again
i
begged
and
he
rang
again
but
with
no
better
result
do
you
see
that
the
house
is
shut
up
he
grumbled
we
have
had
orders
to
watch
the
place
but
none
to
take
the
watch
off
there
is
a
young
woman
inside
i
insisted
the
more
i
think
over
last
night
occurrence
the
more
i
am
convinced
that
the
matter
should
be
looked
into
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
was
moving
away
when
we
both
observed
a
woman
standing
in
front
looking
at
us
she
had
a
bundle
in
her
hand
and
her
face
unnaturally
ruddy
though
it
was
had
a
scared
look
which
was
all
the
more
remarkable
from
the
fact
that
it
was
one
of
those
countenances
which
under
ordinary
circumstances
are
capable
of
but
little
expression
she
was
not
a
stranger
to
me
that
is
i
had
seen
her
before
in
or
about
the
house
in
which
we
were
at
that
moment
so
interested
and
not
stopping
to
put
any
curb
on
my
excitement
i
rushed
down
to
the
pavement
and
accosted
her
who
are
you
i
asked
do
you
work
for
the
van
burnams
and
do
you
know
who
the
lady
was
who
came
here
last
night
the
poor
woman
either
startled
by
my
sudden
address
or
by
my
manner
which
may
have
been
a
little
sharp
gave
a
quick
bound
backward
and
was
only
deterred
by
the
near
presence
of
the
policeman
from
attempting
flight
as
it
was
she
stood
her
ground
though
the
fiery
flush
which
made
her
face
so
noticeable
deepened
till
her
cheeks
and
brow
were
scarlet
i
am
the
she
protested
i
have
come
to
open
the
windows
and
air
the
house
ignoring
my
last
question
is
the
family
coming
home
the
policeman
asked
i
do
know
i
think
so
was
her
weak
reply
have
you
the
keys
i
now
demanded
seeing
her
fumbling
in
her
pocket
she
did
not
answer
a
sly
look
displaced
the
anxious
one
she
had
hitherto
displayed
and
she
turned
away
i
do
see
what
business
it
is
of
the
neighbors
she
muttered
throwing
me
a
dissatisfied
scowl
over
her
shoulder
if
you
got
the
keys
we
will
go
in
and
see
that
things
are
all
right
said
the
policeman
stopping
her
with
a
light
touch
she
trembled
i
saw
that
she
trembled
and
naturally
became
excited
something
was
wrong
in
the
van
burnam
mansion
and
i
was
going
to
be
present
at
its
discovery
but
her
next
words
cut
my
hopes
short
i
have
no
objection
to
going
in
she
said
to
the
policeman
but
i
will
not
give
up
my
keys
to
what
right
has
she
in
our
house
any
way
and
i
thought
i
heard
her
murmur
something
about
a
meddlesome
old
maid
the
look
which
i
received
from
the
policeman
convinced
me
that
my
ears
had
not
played
me
false
the
lady
right
he
declared
and
pushing
by
me
quite
disrespectfully
he
led
the
way
to
the
basement
door
into
which
he
and
the
cleaner
presently
disappeared
i
waited
in
front
i
felt
it
to
be
my
duty
to
do
so
the
various
stopped
an
instant
to
stare
at
me
before
proceeding
on
their
way
but
i
did
not
flinch
from
my
post
not
till
i
had
heard
that
the
young
woman
whom
i
had
seen
enter
these
doors
at
midnight
was
well
and
that
her
delay
in
opening
the
windows
was
entirely
due
to
fashionable
laziness
would
i
feel
justified
in
returning
to
my
own
home
and
its
affairs
but
it
took
patience
and
some
courage
to
remain
there
several
minutes
elapsed
before
i
perceived
the
shutters
in
the
third
story
open
and
a
still
longer
time
before
a
window
on
the
second
floor
flew
up
and
the
policeman
looked
out
only
to
meet
my
inquiring
gaze
and
rapidly
disappear
again
meantime
three
or
four
persons
had
stopped
on
the
walk
near
me
the
nucleus
of
a
crowd
which
would
not
be
long
in
collecting
and
i
was
beginning
to
feel
i
was
paying
dearly
for
my
virtuous
resolution
when
the
front
door
burst
violently
open
and
we
caught
sight
of
the
trembling
form
and
shocked
face
of
the
she
dead
she
cried
she
dead
murder
and
would
have
said
more
had
not
the
policeman
pulled
her
back
with
a
growl
which
sounded
very
much
like
a
suppressed
oath
he
would
have
shut
the
door
upon
me
had
i
not
been
quicker
than
lightning
as
it
was
i
got
in
before
it
slammed
and
happily
too
for
just
at
that
moment
the
who
had
grown
paler
every
instant
fell
in
a
heap
in
the
entry
and
the
policeman
who
was
not
the
man
i
would
want
about
me
in
any
trouble
seemed
somewhat
embarrassed
by
this
new
emergency
and
let
me
lift
the
poor
thing
up
and
drag
her
farther
into
the
hall
she
had
fainted
and
should
have
had
something
done
for
her
but
anxious
though
i
always
am
to
be
of
help
where
help
is
needed
i
had
no
sooner
got
within
range
of
the
parlor
door
with
my
burden
than
i
beheld
a
sight
so
terrifying
that
i
involuntarily
let
the
poor
woman
slip
from
my
arms
to
the
floor
in
the
darkness
of
a
dim
corner
for
the
room
had
no
light
save
that
which
came
through
the
doorway
where
i
stood
lay
the
form
of
a
woman
under
a
fallen
piece
of
furniture
her
skirts
and
distended
arms
alone
were
visible
but
no
one
who
saw
the
rigid
outlines
of
her
limbs
could
doubt
for
a
moment
that
she
was
dead
at
a
sight
so
dreadful
and
in
spite
of
all
my
apprehensions
so
unexpected
i
felt
a
sensation
of
sickness
which
in
another
moment
might
have
ended
in
my
fainting
also
if
i
had
not
realized
that
it
would
never
do
for
me
to
lose
my
wits
in
the
presence
of
a
man
who
had
none
too
many
of
his
own
so
i
shook
off
my
momentary
weakness
and
turning
to
the
policeman
who
was
hesitating
between
the
unconscious
figure
of
the
woman
outside
the
door
and
the
dead
form
of
the
one
within
i
cried
sharply
come
man
to
business
the
woman
inside
there
is
dead
but
this
one
is
living
fetch
me
a
pitcher
of
water
from
below
if
you
can
and
then
go
for
whatever
assistance
you
need
i
wait
here
and
bring
this
woman
to
she
is
a
strong
one
and
it
wo
take
long
you
stay
here
alone
with
that
he
began
but
i
stopped
him
with
a
look
of
disdain
of
course
i
will
stay
here
why
not
is
there
anything
in
the
dead
to
be
afraid
of
save
me
from
the
living
and
i
undertake
to
save
myself
from
the
dead
but
his
face
had
grown
very
suspicious
you
go
for
the
water
he
cried
and
see
here
just
call
out
for
some
one
to
telephone
to
police
headquarters
for
the
coroner
and
a
detective
i
do
quit
this
room
till
one
or
the
other
of
them
comes
smiling
at
a
caution
so
very
but
abiding
by
my
invariable
rule
of
never
arguing
with
a
man
unless
i
see
some
way
of
getting
the
better
of
him
i
did
what
he
bade
me
though
i
hated
dreadfully
to
leave
the
spot
and
its
woful
mystery
even
for
so
short
a
time
as
was
required
run
up
to
the
second
story
he
called
out
as
i
passed
by
the
prostrate
figure
of
the
cleaner
tell
them
what
you
want
from
the
window
or
we
will
have
the
whole
street
in
here
so
i
ran
i
had
always
wished
to
visit
this
house
but
had
never
been
encouraged
to
do
so
by
the
misses
van
burnam
and
making
my
way
into
the
front
room
the
door
of
which
stood
wide
open
i
rushed
to
the
window
and
hailed
the
crowd
which
by
this
time
extended
far
out
beyond
the
an
officer
i
called
out
a
police
officer
an
accident
has
occurred
and
the
man
in
charge
here
wants
the
coroner
and
a
detective
from
police
headquarters
who
hurt
is
it
a
man
is
it
a
woman
shouted
up
one
or
two
and
let
us
in
shouted
others
but
the
sight
of
a
boy
rushing
off
to
meet
an
advancing
policeman
satisfied
me
that
help
would
soon
be
forthcoming
so
i
drew
in
my
head
and
looked
about
me
for
the
next
necessity
water
i
was
in
a
lady
probably
that
of
the
eldest
miss
van
burnam
but
it
was
a
which
had
not
been
occupied
for
some
months
and
naturally
it
lacked
the
very
articles
which
would
have
been
of
assistance
to
me
in
the
present
emergency
no
de
on
the
bureau
no
camphor
on
the
but
there
was
water
in
the
pipes
something
i
had
hardly
hoped
for
and
a
mug
on
the
so
i
filled
the
mug
and
ran
with
it
to
the
door
stumbling
as
i
did
so
over
some
small
object
which
i
presently
perceived
to
be
a
little
round
picking
it
up
for
i
hate
anything
like
disorder
i
placed
it
on
a
table
near
by
and
continued
on
my
way
the
woman
was
still
lying
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
i
dashed
the
water
in
her
face
and
she
immediately
came
to
sitting
up
she
was
about
to
open
her
lips
when
she
checked
herself
a
fact
which
struck
me
as
odd
though
i
did
not
allow
my
surprise
to
become
apparent
meantime
i
stole
a
glance
into
the
parlor
the
officer
was
standing
where
i
had
left
him
looking
down
on
the
prostrate
figure
before
him
there
was
no
sign
of
feeling
in
his
heavy
countenance
and
he
had
not
opened
a
shutter
nor
so
far
as
i
could
see
disarranged
an
object
in
the
room
the
mysterious
character
of
the
whole
affair
fascinated
me
in
spite
of
myself
and
leaving
the
now
fully
aroused
woman
in
the
hall
i
was
across
the
parlor
floor
when
the
latter
stopped
me
with
a
shrill
cry
do
leave
me
i
have
never
seen
anything
before
so
horrible
the
poor
dear
the
poor
dear
why
do
he
take
those
dreadful
things
off
her
she
alluded
not
only
to
the
piece
of
furniture
which
had
fallen
upon
the
prostrate
woman
and
which
can
best
be
described
as
a
cabinet
with
closets
below
and
shelves
above
but
to
the
various
articles
of
which
had
tumbled
from
the
shelves
and
which
now
lay
in
broken
pieces
about
her
he
will
do
so
they
will
do
so
very
soon
i
replied
he
is
waiting
for
some
one
with
more
authority
than
himself
for
the
coroner
if
you
know
what
that
means
but
what
if
she
alive
those
things
will
crush
her
let
us
take
them
off
i
help
i
not
too
weak
to
help
do
you
know
who
this
person
is
i
asked
for
her
voice
had
more
feeling
in
it
than
i
thought
natural
to
the
occasion
dreadful
as
it
was
i
she
repeated
her
weak
eyelids
quivering
for
a
moment
as
she
tried
to
sustain
my
scrutiny
how
should
i
know
i
came
in
with
the
policeman
and
have
been
any
nearer
than
i
now
be
what
makes
you
think
i
know
anything
about
her
i
only
the
and
do
even
know
the
names
of
the
family
i
thought
you
seemed
so
very
anxious
i
explained
suspicious
of
her
suspiciousness
which
was
of
so
sly
and
emphatic
a
character
that
it
changed
her
whole
bearing
from
one
of
fear
to
one
of
cunning
in
a
moment
and
who
would
feel
the
like
of
that
for
a
poor
creature
lying
crushed
under
a
heap
of
broken
crockery
crockery
those
japanese
vases
worth
hundreds
of
dollars
that
ormulu
clock
and
those
dresden
figures
which
must
have
been
more
than
a
couple
of
centuries
old
it
a
poor
sense
of
duty
that
keeps
a
man
standing
dumb
and
staring
like
that
when
with
a
lift
of
his
hand
he
could
show
us
the
like
of
her
pretty
face
and
if
it
dead
she
be
or
alive
as
this
burst
of
indignation
was
natural
enough
and
not
altogether
uncalled
for
from
the
standpoint
of
humanity
i
gave
the
woman
a
nod
of
approval
and
wished
i
were
a
man
myself
that
i
might
lift
the
heavy
cabinet
or
whatever
it
was
that
lay
upon
the
poor
creature
before
us
but
not
being
a
man
and
not
judging
it
wise
to
irritate
the
one
representative
of
that
sex
then
present
i
made
no
remark
but
only
took
a
few
steps
farther
into
the
room
followed
as
it
afterwards
appeared
by
the
the
van
burnam
parlors
are
separated
by
an
open
arch
it
was
to
the
right
of
this
arch
and
in
the
corner
opposite
the
doorway
that
the
dead
woman
lay
using
my
eyes
now
that
i
was
somewhat
accustomed
to
the
enveloping
us
i
noticed
two
or
three
facts
which
had
hitherto
escaped
me
one
was
that
she
lay
on
her
back
with
her
feet
pointing
towards
the
hall
door
and
another
that
nowhere
in
the
room
save
in
her
immediate
vicinity
were
there
to
be
seen
any
signs
of
struggle
or
disorder
all
was
as
set
and
proper
as
in
my
own
parlor
when
it
has
been
undisturbed
for
any
length
of
time
by
guests
and
though
i
could
not
see
far
into
the
rooms
beyond
they
were
to
all
appearance
in
an
equally
orderly
condition
meanwhile
the
cleaner
was
trying
to
account
for
the
overturned
cabinet
poor
dear
poor
dear
she
must
have
pulled
it
over
on
herself
but
however
did
she
get
into
the
house
and
what
was
she
doing
in
this
great
empty
place
the
policeman
to
whom
these
remarks
had
evidently
been
addressed
growled
out
some
unintelligible
reply
and
in
her
perplexity
the
woman
turned
towards
me
but
what
could
i
say
to
her
i
had
my
own
private
knowledge
of
the
matter
but
she
was
not
one
to
confide
in
so
i
stoically
shook
my
head
doubly
disappointed
the
poor
thing
shrank
back
after
looking
first
at
the
policeman
and
then
at
me
in
an
odd
appealing
way
difficult
to
understand
then
her
eyes
fell
again
on
the
dead
girl
at
her
feet
and
being
nearer
now
than
before
she
evidently
saw
something
that
startled
her
for
she
sank
on
her
knees
with
a
little
cry
and
began
examining
the
girl
skirts
what
are
you
looking
at
there
growled
the
policeman
get
up
you
no
one
but
the
coroner
has
right
to
lay
hand
on
anything
here
i
doing
no
harm
the
woman
protested
in
an
odd
shaking
voice
i
only
wanted
to
see
what
the
poor
thing
had
on
some
blue
stuff
it
she
asked
me
blue
serge
i
answered
but
very
good
must
have
come
from
altman
or
stern
i
i
not
used
to
sights
like
this
stammered
the
stumbling
awkwardly
to
her
feet
and
looking
as
if
her
few
remaining
wits
had
followed
the
rest
on
an
endless
vacation
i
i
think
i
shall
have
to
go
home
but
she
did
not
move
the
poor
dear
young
is
she
she
presently
insinuated
with
an
odd
catch
in
her
voice
that
gave
to
the
question
an
air
of
hesitation
and
doubt
i
think
she
is
younger
than
either
you
or
myself
i
deigned
to
reply
her
narrow
pointed
shoes
show
she
has
not
reached
the
years
of
discretion
yes
yes
so
they
do
ejaculated
the
cleaner
eagerly
too
eagerly
for
perfect
ingenuousness
that
why
i
said
dear
and
spoke
of
her
pretty
face
i
am
sorry
for
young
folks
when
they
get
into
trouble
aint
you
you
and
me
might
lie
here
and
no
one
be
much
the
worse
for
it
but
a
sweet
lady
like
this
this
was
not
very
flattering
to
me
but
i
was
prevented
from
rebuking
her
by
a
prolonged
shout
from
the
stoop
without
as
a
rush
was
made
against
the
front
door
followed
by
a
shrill
peal
of
the
bell
man
from
headquarters
stolidly
announced
the
policeman
open
the
door
or
step
back
into
the
further
hall
if
you
want
me
to
do
it
such
rudeness
was
uncalled
for
but
considering
myself
too
important
a
witness
to
show
feeling
i
swallowed
my
indignation
and
proceeded
with
all
my
native
dignity
to
the
front
door
ii
questions
as
i
did
so
i
could
catch
the
murmur
of
the
crowd
outside
as
it
seethed
forward
at
the
first
intimation
of
the
door
being
opened
but
my
attention
was
not
so
distracted
by
it
loud
as
it
sounded
after
the
quiet
of
the
house
that
i
failed
to
notice
that
the
door
had
not
been
locked
by
the
gentleman
leaving
the
night
before
and
that
consequently
only
the
night
latch
was
on
with
a
turn
of
the
knob
it
opened
showing
me
the
mob
of
shouting
boys
and
the
forms
of
two
gentlemen
awaiting
admittance
on
the
i
frowned
at
the
mob
and
smiled
on
the
gentlemen
one
of
whom
was
portly
and
in
appearance
and
the
other
spare
with
a
touch
of
severity
in
his
aspect
but
for
some
reason
these
gentlemen
did
not
seem
to
appreciate
the
honor
i
had
done
them
for
they
both
gave
me
a
displeased
glance
which
was
so
odd
and
unsympathetic
in
its
character
that
i
bridled
a
little
though
i
soon
returned
to
my
natural
manner
did
they
realize
at
the
first
glance
that
i
was
destined
to
prove
a
thorn
in
the
sides
of
every
one
connected
with
this
matter
for
days
to
come
are
you
the
woman
who
called
from
the
window
asked
the
larger
of
the
two
whose
business
here
i
found
it
difficult
at
first
to
determine
i
am
was
my
perfectly
reply
i
live
next
door
and
my
presence
here
is
due
to
the
anxious
interest
i
always
take
in
my
neighbors
i
had
reason
to
think
that
all
was
not
as
it
should
be
in
this
house
and
i
was
right
look
in
the
parlor
sirs
they
were
already
as
far
as
the
threshold
of
that
room
and
needed
no
further
encouragement
to
enter
the
heavier
man
went
first
and
the
other
followed
and
you
may
be
sure
i
was
not
far
behind
the
sight
meeting
our
eyes
was
ghastly
enough
as
you
know
but
these
men
were
evidently
accustomed
to
ghastly
sights
for
they
showed
but
little
emotion
i
thought
this
house
was
empty
observed
the
second
gentleman
who
was
evidently
a
doctor
so
it
was
till
last
night
i
put
in
and
was
about
to
tell
my
story
when
i
felt
my
skirts
jerked
turning
i
found
that
this
warning
had
come
from
the
cleaner
who
stood
close
beside
me
what
do
you
want
i
asked
not
understanding
her
and
having
nothing
to
conceal
i
she
faltered
with
a
frightened
air
nothing
nothing
then
do
interrupt
me
i
harshly
admonished
her
annoyed
at
an
interference
that
tended
to
throw
suspicion
upon
my
candor
this
woman
came
here
to
scrub
and
clean
i
now
explained
it
was
by
means
of
the
key
she
carried
that
we
were
enabled
to
get
into
the
house
i
never
spoke
to
her
till
a
half
hour
ago
at
which
with
a
display
of
subtlety
i
was
far
from
expecting
in
one
of
her
appearance
she
let
her
emotions
take
a
fresh
direction
and
pointing
towards
the
dead
woman
she
impetuously
cried
but
the
poor
child
there
aint
you
going
to
take
those
things
off
of
her
it
wicked
to
leave
her
under
all
that
stuff
suppose
there
was
life
in
her
oh
there
no
hope
of
that
muttered
the
doctor
lifting
one
of
the
hands
and
letting
it
fall
again
still
he
cast
a
side
look
at
his
companion
who
gave
him
a
meaning
nod
it
might
be
well
enough
to
lift
this
cabinet
sufficiently
for
me
to
lay
my
hand
on
her
heart
they
accordingly
did
this
and
the
doctor
leaning
down
placed
his
hand
over
the
poor
bruised
breast
no
life
he
murmured
she
has
been
dead
some
hours
do
you
think
we
had
better
release
the
head
he
went
on
glancing
up
at
the
portly
man
at
his
side
but
the
latter
who
was
rapidly
growing
serious
made
a
slight
protest
with
his
finger
and
turning
to
me
inquired
with
sudden
authority
what
did
you
mean
when
you
said
that
the
house
had
been
empty
till
last
night
just
what
i
said
sir
it
was
empty
till
about
midnight
when
two
persons
again
i
felt
my
dress
twitched
this
time
very
cautiously
what
did
the
woman
want
not
daring
to
give
her
a
look
for
these
men
were
only
too
ready
to
detect
harm
in
everything
i
did
i
gently
drew
my
skirt
away
and
took
a
step
aside
going
on
as
if
no
interruption
had
occurred
did
i
say
persons
i
should
have
said
a
man
and
a
woman
drove
up
to
the
house
and
entered
i
saw
them
from
my
window
you
did
murmured
my
interlocutor
whom
i
had
by
this
time
decided
to
be
a
detective
and
this
is
the
woman
i
suppose
he
proceeded
pointing
to
the
poor
creature
lying
before
us
why
yes
of
course
who
else
can
she
be
i
did
not
see
the
lady
face
last
night
but
she
was
young
and
light
on
her
feet
and
ran
up
the
stoop
gaily
and
the
man
where
is
the
man
i
do
see
him
here
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
he
went
very
soon
after
he
came
not
ten
minutes
after
i
should
say
that
is
what
alarmed
me
and
caused
me
to
have
the
house
investigated
it
did
not
seem
natural
or
like
any
of
the
van
burnams
to
leave
a
woman
to
spend
the
night
in
so
large
a
house
alone
you
know
the
van
burnams
not
well
but
that
do
signify
i
know
what
report
says
of
them
they
are
gentlemen
but
van
burnam
is
in
europe
he
has
two
sons
living
here
no
the
unmarried
one
spends
his
nights
at
long
branch
and
the
other
is
with
his
wife
somewhere
in
connecticut
how
did
the
young
couple
you
saw
get
in
last
night
was
there
any
one
here
to
admit
them
no
the
gentleman
had
a
key
ah
he
had
a
key
the
tone
in
which
this
was
said
recurred
to
me
afterwards
but
at
the
moment
i
was
much
more
impressed
by
a
peculiar
sound
i
heard
behind
me
something
between
a
gasp
and
a
click
in
the
throat
which
came
i
knew
from
the
and
which
odd
and
contradictory
as
it
may
appear
struck
me
as
an
expression
of
satisfaction
though
what
there
was
in
my
admission
to
give
satisfaction
to
this
poor
creature
i
could
not
conjecture
moving
so
as
to
get
a
glimpse
of
her
face
i
went
on
with
the
grim
natural
to
my
character
and
when
he
came
out
he
walked
briskly
away
the
carriage
had
not
waited
for
him
ah
again
muttered
the
gentleman
picking
up
one
of
the
broken
pieces
of
china
which
lay
haphazard
about
the
floor
while
i
studied
the
cleaner
face
which
to
my
amazement
gave
evidences
of
a
confusion
of
emotions
most
unaccountable
to
me
gryce
may
have
noticed
this
too
for
he
immediately
addressed
her
though
he
continued
to
look
at
the
broken
piece
of
china
in
his
hand
and
how
come
you
to
be
cleaning
the
house
he
asked
is
the
family
coming
home
they
are
sir
she
answered
hiding
her
emotion
with
great
skill
the
moment
she
perceived
attention
directed
to
herself
and
speaking
with
a
sudden
volubility
that
made
us
all
stare
they
are
expected
any
day
i
did
know
it
till
yesterday
was
it
yesterday
no
the
day
before
when
young
franklin
he
is
the
oldest
son
sir
and
a
very
nice
man
a
nice
man
sent
me
word
by
letter
that
i
was
to
get
the
house
ready
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
done
it
for
them
sir
and
as
soon
as
i
could
get
the
basement
key
from
the
agent
i
came
here
and
worked
all
day
yesterday
washing
up
the
floors
and
dusting
i
should
have
been
at
them
again
this
morning
if
my
husband
had
been
sick
but
i
had
to
go
to
the
infirmary
for
medicine
and
it
was
noon
when
i
got
here
and
then
i
found
this
lady
standing
outside
with
a
policeman
a
very
nice
lady
a
very
lady
indeed
sir
i
pay
my
respects
to
her
and
she
actually
dropped
me
a
curtsey
like
a
peasant
woman
in
a
play
and
they
took
my
key
from
me
and
the
policeman
opens
the
door
and
he
and
me
go
upstairs
and
into
all
the
rooms
and
when
we
come
to
this
one
she
was
getting
so
excited
as
to
be
hardly
intelligible
stopping
herself
with
a
jerk
she
fumbled
nervously
with
her
apron
while
i
asked
myself
how
she
could
have
been
at
work
in
this
house
the
day
before
without
my
knowing
it
suddenly
i
remembered
that
i
was
ill
in
the
morning
and
busy
in
the
afternoon
at
the
orphan
asylum
and
somewhat
relieved
at
finding
so
excellent
an
excuse
for
my
ignorance
i
looked
up
to
see
if
the
detective
had
noticed
anything
odd
in
this
behavior
presumably
he
had
but
having
more
experience
than
myself
with
the
susceptibility
of
ignorant
persons
in
the
presence
of
danger
and
distress
he
attached
less
importance
to
it
than
i
did
for
which
i
was
secretly
glad
without
exactly
knowing
my
reasons
for
being
so
you
will
be
wanted
as
a
witness
by
the
coroner
jury
he
now
remarked
to
her
looking
as
if
he
were
addressing
the
piece
of
china
he
was
turning
over
in
his
hand
now
no
nonsense
he
protested
as
she
commenced
to
tremble
and
plead
you
were
the
first
one
to
see
this
dead
woman
and
you
must
be
on
hand
to
say
so
as
i
can
not
tell
you
when
the
inquest
will
be
held
you
had
better
stay
around
till
the
coroner
comes
he
be
here
soon
you
and
this
other
woman
too
by
other
woman
he
meant
miss
butterworth
of
colonial
ancestry
and
no
inconsiderable
importance
in
the
social
world
but
though
i
did
not
relish
this
careless
association
of
myself
with
this
poor
i
was
careful
to
show
no
displeasure
for
i
reasoned
that
as
witnesses
we
were
equal
before
the
law
and
that
it
was
solely
in
this
light
he
regarded
us
there
was
something
in
the
manner
of
both
these
gentlemen
which
convinced
me
that
while
my
presence
was
considered
desirable
in
the
house
it
was
not
especially
wanted
in
the
room
i
was
therefore
moving
reluctantly
away
when
i
felt
a
slight
but
peremptory
touch
on
the
arm
and
turning
saw
the
detective
at
my
side
still
studying
his
piece
of
china
he
was
as
i
have
said
of
portly
build
and
benevolent
aspect
a
man
and
not
at
all
the
person
one
would
be
likely
to
associate
with
the
police
yet
he
could
take
the
lead
very
naturally
and
when
he
spoke
i
felt
bound
to
answer
him
will
you
be
so
good
madam
as
to
relate
over
again
what
you
saw
from
your
window
last
night
i
am
likely
to
have
charge
of
this
matter
and
would
be
pleased
to
hear
all
you
may
have
to
say
concerning
it
my
name
is
butterworth
i
politely
intimated
and
my
name
is
gryce
a
detective
the
same
you
must
think
this
matter
very
serious
i
ventured
death
by
violence
is
always
serious
you
must
regard
this
death
as
something
more
than
an
accident
i
mean
his
smile
seemed
to
say
you
will
not
know
how
i
regard
it
and
you
will
not
know
what
i
think
of
it
either
was
my
inward
rejoinder
but
i
said
nothing
aloud
for
the
man
was
if
he
was
a
day
and
i
have
been
taught
respect
for
age
and
have
practised
the
same
for
fifty
years
and
more
i
must
have
shown
what
was
passing
in
my
mind
and
he
must
have
seen
it
reflected
on
the
polished
surface
of
the
porcelain
he
was
contemplating
for
his
lips
showed
the
shadow
of
a
smile
sufficiently
sarcastic
for
me
to
see
that
he
was
far
from
being
as
as
his
countenance
indicated
come
come
said
he
there
is
the
coroner
now
say
what
you
have
to
say
like
the
straightforward
honest
woman
you
appear
i
do
like
compliments
i
snapped
out
indeed
they
have
always
been
obnoxious
to
me
as
if
there
was
any
merit
in
being
honest
and
straightforward
or
any
distinction
in
being
told
so
i
am
miss
butterworth
and
not
in
the
habit
of
being
spoken
to
as
if
i
were
a
simple
countrywoman
i
objected
but
i
will
repeat
what
i
saw
last
night
as
it
is
no
secret
and
the
telling
of
it
wo
hurt
me
and
may
help
you
accordingly
i
went
over
the
whole
story
and
was
much
more
loquacious
than
i
had
intended
to
be
his
manner
was
so
insinuating
and
his
inquiries
so
pertinent
but
one
topic
we
both
failed
to
broach
and
that
was
the
peculiar
manner
of
the
perhaps
it
had
not
struck
him
as
peculiar
and
perhaps
it
should
not
have
struck
me
so
but
in
the
silence
which
was
preserved
on
the
subject
i
felt
i
had
acquired
an
advantage
over
him
which
might
lead
to
consequences
of
no
small
importance
would
i
have
felt
thus
or
congratulated
myself
quite
so
much
upon
my
fancied
superiority
if
i
had
known
he
was
the
man
who
managed
the
leavenworth
case
and
who
in
his
early
years
had
experienced
that
very
wonderful
adventure
on
the
staircase
of
the
heart
delight
perhaps
i
would
for
though
i
have
had
no
adventures
i
feel
capable
of
them
and
as
for
any
peculiar
acumen
he
may
have
shown
in
his
long
and
eventful
career
why
that
is
a
quality
which
others
may
share
with
him
as
i
hope
to
be
able
to
prove
before
finishing

iii
amelia
discovers
herself
there
is
a
small
room
at
the
extremity
of
the
van
burnam
mansion
in
this
i
took
refuge
after
my
interview
with
gryce
as
i
picked
out
the
chair
which
best
suited
me
and
settled
myself
for
a
comfortable
communion
with
my
own
thoughts
i
was
astonished
to
find
how
much
i
was
enjoying
myself
notwithstanding
the
thousand
and
one
duties
awaiting
me
on
the
other
side
of
the
even
this
very
solitude
was
welcome
for
it
gave
me
an
opportunity
to
consider
matters
i
had
not
known
up
to
this
very
hour
that
i
had
any
special
gifts
my
father
who
was
a
shrewd
man
of
the
old
new
england
type
said
more
times
than
i
am
years
old
which
was
not
saying
it
as
often
as
some
may
think
that
araminta
the
name
i
was
christened
by
and
the
name
you
will
find
in
the
bible
record
though
i
sign
myself
amelia
and
insist
upon
being
addressed
as
amelia
being
as
i
hope
a
sensible
woman
and
not
the
piece
of
antiquated
sentimentality
suggested
by
the
former
cognomen
that
araminta
would
live
to
make
her
mark
though
in
what
capacity
he
never
informed
me
being
as
i
have
observed
a
shrewd
man
and
thus
not
likely
to
thoughtlessly
commit
himself
i
now
know
he
was
right
my
pretensions
dating
from
the
moment
i
found
that
this
affair
at
first
glance
so
simple
and
at
the
next
so
complicated
had
aroused
in
me
a
fever
of
investigation
which
no
reasoning
could
allay
though
i
had
other
and
more
personal
matters
on
my
mind
my
thoughts
would
rest
nowhere
but
on
the
details
of
this
tragedy
and
having
as
i
thought
noticed
some
few
facts
in
connection
with
it
from
which
conclusions
might
be
drawn
i
amused
myself
with
jotting
them
down
on
the
back
of
a
disputed
grocer
bill
i
happened
to
find
in
my
pocket
valueless
as
explaining
this
tragedy
being
founded
upon
insufficient
evidence
they
may
be
interesting
as
showing
the
workings
of
my
mind
even
at
this
early
stage
of
the
matter
they
were
drawn
up
under
three
heads
first
was
the
death
of
this
young
woman
an
accident
second
was
it
a
suicide
third
was
it
a
murder
under
the
first
head
i
wrote
reasons
for
not
thinking
it
an
if
it
had
been
an
accident
and
she
had
pulled
the
cabinet
over
upon
herself
she
would
have
been
found
with
her
feet
pointing
towards
the
wall
where
the
cabinet
had
stood
but
her
feet
were
towards
the
door
and
her
head
under
the
cabinet
the
decent
even
precise
arrangement
of
the
clothing
about
her
feet
which
precludes
any
theory
involving
accident
under
the
second
for
not
thinking
it
she
could
not
have
been
found
in
the
position
observed
without
having
lain
down
on
the
floor
while
living
and
then
pulled
the
shelves
down
upon
herself
a
theory
obviously
too
improbable
to
be
considered
under
the
third
for
not
thinking
it
she
would
need
to
have
been
held
down
on
the
floor
while
the
cabinet
was
being
pulled
over
on
her
something
which
the
quiet
aspect
of
the
hands
and
feet
made
appear
impossible
to
this
i
added
for
accepting
the
theory
of
the
fact
that
she
did
not
go
into
the
house
alone
that
a
man
entered
with
her
remained
ten
minutes
and
then
came
out
again
and
disappeared
up
the
street
with
every
appearance
of
haste
and
an
anxious
desire
to
leave
the
spot
the
front
door
which
he
had
unlocked
on
entering
was
not
locked
by
him
on
his
departure
the
catch
doing
the
locking
yet
though
he
could
have
so
easily
he
had
shown
no
disposition
to
return
the
arrangement
of
the
skirts
which
show
the
touch
of
a
careful
hand
after
death
nothing
clear
you
see
i
was
doubtful
of
all
and
yet
my
suspicions
tended
most
toward
murder
i
had
eaten
my
luncheon
before
interfering
in
this
matter
which
was
fortunate
for
me
as
it
was
three
before
i
was
summoned
to
meet
the
coroner
of
whose
arrival
i
had
been
conscious
some
time
before
he
was
in
the
front
parlor
where
the
dead
girl
lay
and
as
i
took
my
way
thither
i
felt
the
same
sensations
of
faintness
which
had
so
nearly
overcome
me
on
the
previous
occasion
but
i
mastered
them
and
was
quite
myself
before
i
crossed
the
threshold
there
were
several
gentlemen
present
but
of
them
all
i
only
noticed
two
one
of
whom
i
took
to
be
the
coroner
while
the
other
was
my
late
interlocutor
gryce
from
the
animation
observable
in
the
latter
i
gathered
that
the
case
was
growing
in
interest
from
the
detective
standpoint
ah
and
is
this
the
witness
asked
the
coroner
as
i
stepped
into
the
room
i
am
miss
butterworth
was
my
calm
reply
butterworth
living
next
door
and
present
at
the
discovery
of
this
poor
murdered
body
murdered
he
repeated
why
do
you
say
murdered
for
reply
i
drew
from
my
pocket
the
bill
on
which
i
had
scribbled
my
conclusions
in
regard
to
this
matter
read
this
said
evidently
astonished
he
took
the
paper
from
my
hand
and
after
some
curious
glances
in
my
direction
condescended
to
do
as
i
requested
the
result
was
an
odd
but
grudging
look
of
admiration
directed
towards
myself
and
a
quick
passing
over
of
the
paper
to
the
detective
the
latter
who
had
exchanged
his
bit
of
broken
china
for
a
very
much
used
and
frowned
with
a
whimsical
air
at
the
latter
before
he
put
it
in
his
pocket
then
he
read
my
hurried
scrawl
two
richmonds
in
the
field
commented
the
coroner
with
a
sly
chuckle
i
am
afraid
i
shall
have
to
yield
to
their
allied
forces
miss
butterworth
the
cabinet
is
about
to
be
raised
do
you
feel
as
if
you
could
endure
the
sight
i
can
stand
anything
where
the
cause
of
justice
is
involved
i
replied
very
well
then
sit
down
if
you
please
when
the
whole
body
is
visible
i
will
call
you
and
stepping
forward
he
gave
orders
to
have
the
clock
and
broken
china
removed
from
about
the
body
as
the
former
was
laid
away
on
one
end
of
the
mantel
some
one
observed
what
a
valuable
witness
that
clock
might
have
been
had
it
been
running
when
the
shelves
fell
but
the
fact
was
so
patent
that
it
had
not
been
in
motion
for
months
that
no
one
even
answered
and
gryce
did
not
so
much
as
look
towards
it
but
then
we
had
all
seen
that
the
hands
stood
at
three
minutes
to
five
i
had
been
asked
to
sit
down
but
i
found
this
impossible
side
by
side
with
the
detective
i
viewed
the
replacing
of
that
heavy
piece
of
furniture
against
the
wall
and
the
slow
disclosure
of
the
upper
part
of
the
body
which
had
so
long
lain
hidden
that
i
did
not
give
way
is
a
proof
that
my
father
prophecy
was
not
without
some
reasonable
foundation
for
the
sight
was
one
to
try
the
stoutest
nerves
as
well
as
to
awaken
the
compassion
of
the
hardest
heart
the
coroner
meeting
my
eye
pointed
at
the
poor
creature
inquiringly
is
this
the
woman
you
saw
enter
here
last
night
i
glanced
down
at
her
dress
noted
the
short
summer
cape
tied
to
the
neck
with
an
elaborate
bow
of
ribbon
and
nodded
my
head
i
remember
the
cape
said
i
but
where
is
her
hat
she
wore
one
let
me
see
if
i
can
describe
it
closing
my
eyes
i
endeavored
to
recall
the
dim
silhouette
of
her
figure
as
she
stood
passing
up
the
change
to
the
driver
and
was
so
far
successful
that
i
was
ready
to
announce
at
the
next
moment
that
her
hat
presented
the
effect
of
a
soft
felt
with
one
feather
or
one
bow
of
ribbon
standing
upright
from
the
side
of
the
crown
then
the
identity
of
this
woman
with
the
one
you
saw
enter
here
last
night
is
established
remarked
the
detective
stooping
down
and
drawing
from
under
the
poor
girl
body
a
hat
sufficiently
like
the
one
i
had
just
described
to
satisfy
everybody
that
it
was
the
same
as
if
there
could
be
any
doubt
i
began
but
the
coroner
explaining
that
it
was
a
mere
formality
motioned
me
to
stand
aside
in
favor
of
the
doctor
who
seemed
anxious
to
approach
nearer
the
spot
where
the
dead
woman
lay
this
i
was
about
to
do
when
a
sudden
thought
struck
me
and
i
reached
out
my
hand
for
the
hat
let
me
look
at
it
for
a
moment
said
gryce
at
once
handed
it
over
and
i
took
a
good
look
at
it
inside
and
out
it
is
pretty
badly
crushed
i
observed
and
does
not
present
a
very
fresh
appearance
but
for
all
that
it
has
been
worn
but
once
how
do
you
know
questioned
the
coroner
let
the
other
richmond
inform
you
was
my
grimly
uttered
reply
as
i
gave
it
again
into
the
detective
hand
there
was
a
murmur
about
me
whether
of
amusement
or
displeasure
i
made
no
effort
to
decide
i
was
finding
out
something
for
myself
and
i
did
not
care
what
they
thought
of
me
neither
has
she
worn
this
dress
long
i
continued
but
that
is
not
true
of
the
shoes
they
are
not
old
but
they
have
been
acquainted
with
the
pavement
and
that
is
more
than
can
be
said
of
the
hem
of
this
gown
there
are
no
gloves
on
her
hands
a
few
minutes
elapsed
then
before
the
assault
long
enough
for
her
to
take
them
off
smart
woman
whispered
a
voice
in
my
ear
a
voice
that
i
had
no
difficulty
in
ascribing
to
gryce
but
are
you
sure
she
wore
any
did
you
notice
that
her
hand
was
gloved
when
she
came
into
the
house
no
i
answered
frankly
but
so
a
woman
would
not
enter
a
house
like
this
without
gloves
it
was
a
warm
night
some
one
suggested
i
do
care
you
will
find
her
gloves
as
you
have
her
hat
and
you
will
find
them
with
the
fingers
turned
inside
out
just
as
she
drew
them
from
her
hand
so
much
i
will
concede
to
the
warmth
of
the
weather
like
these
for
instance
broke
in
a
quiet
voice
startled
for
a
hand
had
appeared
over
my
shoulder
dangling
a
pair
of
gloves
before
my
eyes
i
cried
out
somewhat
too
triumphantly
i
own
yes
yes
just
like
those
did
you
pick
them
up
here
are
they
hers
you
say
that
this
is
the
way
hers
should
look
and
i
repeat
it
then
allow
me
to
pay
you
my
compliments
these
were
picked
up
here
but
where
i
cried
i
thought
i
had
looked
this
carpet
well
over
he
smiled
not
at
me
but
at
the
gloves
and
the
thought
crossed
me
that
he
felt
as
if
something
more
than
the
gloves
was
being
turned
inside
out
i
therefore
pursed
my
mouth
and
determined
to
stand
more
on
my
guard
it
is
of
no
consequence
i
assured
him
all
such
matters
will
come
out
at
the
inquest
gryce
nodded
and
put
the
gloves
back
in
his
pocket
with
them
he
seemed
to
pocket
some
of
his
geniality
and
patience
all
these
facts
have
been
gone
over
before
you
came
in
said
he
which
statement
i
beg
to
consider
as
open
to
doubt
the
doctor
who
had
hardly
moved
a
muscle
during
all
this
colloquy
now
rose
from
his
kneeling
position
beside
the
girl
head
i
shall
have
to
ask
the
presence
of
another
physician
said
he
will
you
send
for
one
from
your
office
coroner
dahl
at
which
i
stepped
back
and
the
coroner
stepped
forward
saying
however
as
he
passed
me
the
inquest
will
be
held
day
after
in
my
office
hold
yourself
in
readiness
to
be
present
i
regard
you
as
one
of
my
chief
witnesses
i
assured
him
i
would
be
on
hand
and
obeying
a
gesture
of
his
finger
retreated
from
the
room
but
i
did
not
yet
leave
the
house
a
straight
slim
man
with
a
very
small
head
but
a
very
bright
eye
was
leaning
on
the
in
the
front
hall
and
when
he
saw
me
started
up
so
alertly
i
perceived
that
he
had
business
with
me
and
so
waited
for
him
to
speak
you
are
miss
butterworth
he
inquired
i
am
sir
and
i
am
a
reporter
from
the
new
york
will
you
allow
me
why
did
he
stop
i
had
merely
looked
at
him
but
he
did
stop
and
that
is
saying
considerable
for
a
reporter
from
the
new
york
i
certainly
am
willing
to
tell
you
what
i
have
told
every
one
else
i
interposed
considering
it
better
not
to
make
an
enemy
of
so
judicious
a
young
man
and
seeing
him
brighten
up
at
this
i
thereupon
related
all
i
considered
desirable
for
the
general
public
to
know
i
was
about
passing
on
when
reflecting
that
one
good
turn
deserves
another
i
paused
and
asked
him
if
he
thought
they
would
leave
the
dead
girl
in
that
house
all
night
he
answered
that
he
did
not
think
they
would
that
a
telegram
had
been
sent
some
time
before
to
young
van
burnam
and
that
they
were
only
awaiting
his
arrival
to
remove
her
do
you
mean
howard
i
asked
is
he
the
elder
one
no
it
is
the
elder
one
they
have
summoned
the
one
who
has
been
staying
at
long
branch
how
can
they
expect
him
then
so
soon
because
he
is
in
the
city
it
seems
the
old
gentleman
is
going
to
return
on
the
and
as
she
is
due
here
franklin
van
burnam
has
come
to
new
york
to
meet
him
humph
thought
i
lively
times
are
in
prospect
and
for
the
first
time
i
remembered
my
dinner
and
the
orders
which
had
not
been
given
about
some
curtains
which
were
to
have
been
hung
that
day
and
all
the
other
reasons
i
had
for
being
at
home
i
must
have
shown
my
feelings
much
as
i
pride
myself
upon
my
impassibility
upon
all
occasions
for
he
immediately
held
out
his
arm
with
an
offer
to
pilot
me
through
the
crowd
to
my
own
house
and
i
was
about
to
accept
it
when
the
rang
so
sharply
that
we
involuntarily
stopped
a
fresh
witness
or
a
telegram
for
the
coroner
whispered
the
reporter
in
my
ear
i
tried
to
look
indifferent
and
doubtless
made
out
pretty
well
for
he
added
after
a
sly
look
in
my
face
you
do
not
care
to
stay
any
longer
i
made
no
reply
but
i
think
he
was
impressed
by
my
dignity
could
he
not
see
that
it
would
be
the
height
of
for
me
to
rush
out
in
the
face
of
any
one
coming
in
an
officer
opened
the
door
and
when
we
saw
who
stood
there
i
am
sure
that
the
reporter
as
well
as
myself
was
grateful
that
we
listened
to
the
dictates
of
politeness
it
was
young
van
burnam
franklin
i
mean
the
older
and
more
respectable
of
the
two
sons
he
was
flushed
and
agitated
and
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
annihilate
the
crowd
pushing
him
about
on
his
own
stoop
he
gave
an
angry
glance
backward
as
he
stepped
in
and
then
i
saw
that
a
carriage
covered
with
baggage
stood
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
and
gathered
that
he
had
not
returned
to
his
father
house
alone
what
has
happened
what
does
all
this
mean
were
the
words
he
hurled
at
us
as
the
door
closed
behind
him
and
he
found
himself
face
to
face
with
a
half
dozen
strangers
among
whom
the
reporter
and
myself
stood
conspicuous
gryce
coming
suddenly
from
somewhere
was
the
one
to
answer
him
a
painful
occurrence
sir
a
young
girl
has
been
found
here
dead
crushed
under
one
of
your
parlor
cabinets
a
young
girl
he
repeated
oh
how
glad
i
was
that
i
had
been
brought
up
never
to
transgress
the
principles
of
politeness
here
in
this
house
what
young
girl
you
mean
old
woman
do
you
not
the
or
some
one
no
van
burnam
we
mean
what
we
say
though
possibly
i
should
call
her
a
young
lady
she
is
dressed
quite
fashionably
the
really
i
can
not
repeat
in
this
public
manner
the
word
which
van
burnam
used
i
excused
him
at
the
time
but
i
will
not
perpetuate
his
forgetfulness
in
these
pages
she
is
still
lying
as
we
found
her
gryce
now
proceeded
in
his
quiet
almost
fatherly
way
will
you
not
take
a
look
at
her
perhaps
you
can
tell
us
who
she
is
i
van
burnam
seemed
quite
shocked
how
should
i
know
her
some
thief
probably
killed
while
meddling
with
other
people
property
perhaps
quoth
gryce
laconically
at
which
i
felt
so
angry
as
tending
to
mislead
my
handsome
young
neighbor
that
i
irresistibly
did
what
i
had
fully
made
up
my
mind
not
to
do
that
is
stepped
into
view
and
took
a
part
in
this
conversation
how
can
you
say
that
i
cried
when
her
admittance
here
was
due
to
a
young
man
who
let
her
in
at
midnight
with
a
key
and
then
left
her
to
eat
out
her
heart
in
this
great
house
all
alone
i
have
made
sensations
in
my
life
but
never
quite
so
marked
a
one
as
this
in
an
instant
every
eye
was
on
me
with
the
exception
of
the
detective
his
was
on
the
figure
crowning
the
and
bitterly
severe
his
gaze
was
too
though
it
immediately
grew
wary
as
the
young
man
started
towards
me
and
impetuously
demanded
who
talks
like
that
why
it
miss
butterworth
madam
i
fear
i
did
not
fully
understand
what
you
said
whereupon
i
repeated
my
words
this
time
very
quietly
but
clearly
while
gryce
continued
to
frown
at
the
bronze
figure
he
had
taken
into
his
confidence
when
i
had
finished
van
burnam
countenance
had
changed
so
had
his
manner
he
held
himself
as
erect
as
before
but
not
with
as
much
bravado
he
showed
haste
and
impatience
also
but
not
the
same
kind
of
haste
and
not
quite
the
same
kind
of
impatience
the
corners
of
gryce
mouth
betrayed
that
he
noted
this
change
but
he
did
not
turn
away
from
the
this
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
which
you
have
just
told
me
observed
van
burnam
with
the
first
bow
i
had
ever
received
from
him
i
do
know
what
to
think
of
it
but
i
still
hold
that
it
some
thief
killed
did
you
say
really
dead
well
i
have
given
five
hundred
dollars
not
to
have
had
it
happen
in
this
house
he
had
been
moving
towards
the
parlor
door
and
he
now
entered
it
instantly
gryce
was
by
his
side
are
they
going
to
close
the
door
i
whispered
to
the
reporter
who
was
taking
this
all
in
equally
with
myself
i
afraid
so
he
muttered
and
they
did
gryce
had
evidently
had
enough
of
my
interference
and
was
resolved
to
shut
me
out
but
i
heard
one
word
and
caught
one
glimpse
of
van
burnam
face
before
the
heavy
door
fell
to
the
word
was
oh
so
bad
as
that
how
can
any
one
recognize
her
and
the
glimpse
well
the
glimpse
proved
to
me
that
he
was
much
more
profoundly
agitated
than
he
wished
to
appear
and
any
extraordinary
agitation
on
his
part
was
certainly
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
very
sentence
he
was
at
that
moment
uttering
iv
silas
van
burnam
however
much
i
may
be
needed
at
home
i
can
not
reconcile
it
with
my
sense
of
duty
to
leave
just
yet
i
confided
to
the
reporter
with
what
i
meant
to
be
a
proper
show
of
reason
and
van
burnam
may
wish
to
ask
me
some
questions
of
course
of
course
acquiesced
the
other
you
are
very
right
always
are
very
right
i
should
judge
as
i
did
not
know
what
he
meant
by
this
i
frowned
always
a
wise
thing
to
do
in
an
uncertainty
that
is
if
one
wishes
to
maintain
an
air
of
independence
and
aversion
to
flattery
will
you
not
sit
down
he
suggested
there
is
a
chair
at
the
end
of
the
hall
but
i
had
no
need
to
sit
the
front
again
rang
and
simultaneously
with
its
opening
the
parlor
door
unclosed
and
franklin
van
burnam
appeared
in
the
hall
just
as
silas
van
burnam
his
father
stepped
into
the
vestibule
father
he
remonstrated
with
a
troubled
air
could
you
not
wait
the
elder
gentleman
who
had
evidently
just
been
driven
up
from
the
steamer
wiped
his
forehead
with
an
irascible
air
that
i
will
say
i
had
noticed
in
him
before
and
on
much
less
provocation
wait
with
a
yelling
crowd
screaming
murder
in
my
ear
and
isabella
on
one
side
of
me
calling
for
salts
and
caroline
on
the
opposite
seat
getting
that
blue
look
about
the
mouth
we
have
learned
to
dread
so
in
a
hot
day
like
this
no
sir
when
there
is
anything
wrong
going
on
i
want
to
know
it
and
evidently
there
is
something
wrong
going
on
here
what
is
it
some
of
howard
but
the
son
seizing
me
by
the
hand
and
drawing
me
forward
put
a
quick
stop
to
the
old
gentleman
sentence
miss
butterworth
father
our
neighbor
you
know
ah
hum
ha
miss
butterworth
how
do
you
do
what
the
is
she
doing
here
he
grumbled
not
so
low
but
that
i
heard
both
the
profanity
and
the
none
too
complimentary
allusion
to
myself
if
you
will
come
into
the
parlor
i
will
tell
you
urged
the
son
but
what
have
you
done
with
isabella
and
caroline
left
them
in
the
carriage
with
that
hooting
mob
about
them
i
told
the
coachman
to
drive
on
they
are
probably
around
the
block
by
this
time
then
come
in
here
but
do
allow
yourself
to
be
too
much
affected
by
what
you
will
see
a
sad
accident
has
occurred
here
and
you
must
expect
the
sight
of
blood
blood
oh
i
can
stand
that
if
howard
the
rest
was
lost
in
the
sound
of
the
closing
door
and
now
you
will
say
i
ought
to
have
gone
and
you
are
right
but
would
you
have
gone
yourself
especially
as
the
hall
was
full
of
people
who
did
not
belong
there
if
you
would
then
condemn
me
for
lingering
just
a
few
minutes
longer
the
voices
in
the
parlor
were
loud
but
they
presently
subsided
and
when
the
owner
of
the
house
came
out
again
he
had
a
subdued
look
which
was
as
great
a
contrast
to
his
angry
aspect
on
entering
as
was
the
change
i
had
observed
in
his
son
he
was
so
absorbed
indeed
that
he
did
not
notice
me
though
i
stood
directly
in
his
way
do
let
howard
come
he
was
saying
in
a
thick
low
voice
to
his
son
keep
howard
away
till
we
are
sure
i
am
confident
that
his
son
pressed
his
arm
at
this
point
for
he
stopped
short
and
looked
about
him
in
a
blind
and
dazed
way
oh
he
ejaculated
in
a
tone
of
great
displeasure
this
is
the
woman
who
saw
miss
butterworth
father
the
anxious
voice
of
his
son
broke
in
do
try
to
talk
such
a
sight
is
enough
to
unnerve
any
man
yes
yes
blustered
the
old
gentleman
evidently
taking
some
hint
from
the
other
tone
or
manner
but
where
are
the
girls
they
will
be
dead
with
terror
if
we
do
relieve
their
minds
they
got
the
idea
it
was
their
brother
howard
who
was
hurt
and
so
did
i
but
it
only
some
wandering
waif
some
it
seemed
as
if
he
was
not
to
be
allowed
to
finish
any
of
his
sentences
for
franklin
interrupted
him
at
this
point
to
ask
him
what
he
was
going
to
do
with
the
girls
certainly
he
could
not
bring
them
in
here
no
answered
the
father
but
in
the
dreamy
inconsequential
way
of
one
whose
thoughts
were
elsewhere
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
take
them
to
some
hotel
ah
an
idea
i
flushed
as
i
realized
the
opportunity
which
had
come
to
me
and
had
to
wait
a
moment
not
to
speak
with
too
much
eagerness
let
me
play
the
part
of
a
neighbor
i
prayed
and
accommodate
the
young
ladies
for
the
night
my
house
is
near
and
quiet
but
the
trouble
it
will
involve
protested
franklin
is
just
what
i
need
to
allay
my
excitement
i
responded
i
shall
be
glad
to
offer
them
rooms
for
the
night
if
they
are
equally
glad
to
accept
them
they
must
be
the
old
gentleman
declared
i
ca
go
running
round
with
them
hunting
up
rooms
miss
butterworth
is
very
good
go
find
the
girls
franklin
let
me
have
them
off
my
mind
at
least
the
young
man
bowed
i
bowed
and
was
slipping
at
last
from
my
place
by
the
stairs
when
for
the
third
time
i
felt
my
dress
twitched
are
you
going
to
keep
to
that
story
a
voice
whispered
in
my
ear
about
the
young
man
and
woman
coming
in
the
night
you
know
keep
to
it
i
whispered
back
recognizing
the
who
had
sidled
up
to
me
from
some
unknown
quarter
in
the
why
it
true
why
should
i
keep
to
it
a
chuckle
difficult
to
describe
but
full
of
meaning
shook
the
arm
of
the
woman
as
she
pressed
close
to
my
side
oh
you
are
a
good
one
she
said
i
did
know
they
made
so
good
and
with
another
chuckle
full
of
satisfaction
and
an
odd
sort
of
admiration
i
had
certainly
not
earned
she
slid
away
again
into
the
darkness
certainly
there
was
something
in
this
woman
attitude
towards
this
affair
which
merited
attention
this
is
no
one
i
know
i
welcomed
the
misses
van
burnam
with
just
enough
to
show
that
i
had
not
been
influenced
by
any
unworthy
motives
in
asking
them
to
my
house
i
gave
them
my
but
i
invited
them
to
sit
in
my
front
room
as
long
as
there
was
anything
interesting
going
on
in
the
street
i
knew
they
would
like
to
look
out
and
as
this
chamber
boasts
of
a
bay
with
two
windows
we
could
all
be
accommodated
from
where
i
sat
i
could
now
and
then
hear
what
they
said
and
i
considered
this
but
just
for
if
the
young
woman
who
had
suffered
so
untimely
an
end
was
in
any
way
connected
with
them
it
was
certainly
best
that
the
fact
should
not
lie
concealed
and
one
of
them
that
is
isabella
is
such
a
chatterbox
van
burnam
and
his
son
had
returned
next
door
and
so
far
as
we
could
observe
from
our
preparations
were
being
made
for
the
body
removal
as
the
crowd
below
driven
away
by
the
policemen
one
minute
only
to
collect
again
in
another
swayed
and
grumbled
in
a
continual
expectation
that
was
as
continually
disappointed
i
heard
caroline
voice
rise
in
two
or
three
short
sentences
they
ca
find
howard
or
he
would
have
been
here
before
now
did
you
see
her
that
time
when
we
were
coming
out
of
clark
fanny
preston
did
and
said
she
was
pretty
no
i
did
get
a
glimpse
a
shout
from
the
street
below
i
ca
believe
it
were
the
next
words
i
heard
but
franklin
is
awfully
afraid
hush
or
the
ogress
i
am
sure
i
heard
her
say
ogress
but
what
followed
was
drowned
in
another
loud
murmur
and
i
caught
nothing
further
till
these
sentences
were
uttered
by
the
trembling
and
caroline
if
it
is
she
pa
will
never
be
the
same
man
again
to
have
her
die
in
our
house
o
there
howard
now
the
interruption
came
quick
and
sharp
and
it
was
followed
by
a
double
cry
and
an
anxious
rustle
as
the
two
girls
sprang
to
their
feet
in
their
anxiety
to
attract
their
brother
attention
or
possibly
to
convey
him
some
warning
but
i
did
not
give
much
heed
to
them
my
eyes
were
on
the
carriage
in
which
howard
had
arrived
and
which
owing
to
the
ambulance
in
front
had
stopped
on
the
other
side
of
the
way
i
was
anxious
to
see
him
descend
that
i
might
judge
if
his
figure
recalled
that
of
the
man
i
had
seen
cross
the
pavement
the
night
before
but
he
did
not
descend
just
as
his
hand
was
on
the
carriage
door
a
half
dozen
men
appeared
on
the
adjoining
stoop
carrying
a
burden
which
they
hastened
to
deposit
in
the
ambulance
he
sank
back
when
he
saw
it
and
when
his
face
became
visible
again
it
was
so
white
it
seemed
to
be
the
only
face
in
the
street
though
fifty
people
stood
about
staring
at
the
house
at
the
ambulance
and
at
him
franklin
van
burnam
had
evidently
come
to
the
door
with
the
rest
for
howard
no
sooner
showed
his
face
the
second
time
than
we
saw
the
former
dash
down
the
steps
and
try
to
part
the
crowd
in
a
vain
attempt
to
reach
his
brother
side
gryce
was
more
successful
he
had
no
difficulty
in
winning
his
way
across
the
street
and
presently
i
perceived
him
standing
near
the
carriage
exchanging
a
few
words
with
its
occupant
a
moment
later
he
drew
back
and
addressing
the
driver
jumped
into
the
carriage
with
howard
and
was
speedily
driven
off
the
ambulance
followed
and
some
of
the
crowd
and
as
soon
as
a
hack
could
be
obtained
van
burnam
and
his
son
took
the
same
road
leaving
us
three
women
in
a
state
of
suspense
which
as
far
as
one
of
us
was
concerned
ended
in
a
nervous
attack
that
was
not
unlike
heart
failure
i
allude
of
course
to
caroline
and
it
took
isabella
and
myself
a
good
half
hour
to
bring
her
back
to
a
normal
condition
and
when
this
was
done
isabella
thought
it
incumbent
upon
her
to
go
off
into
hysterics
which
being
but
a
weak
simulation
of
the
other
state
i
met
with
severity
and
cured
with
a
frown
when
both
were
in
trim
again
i
allowed
myself
one
remark
one
would
think
said
i
that
you
knew
the
young
woman
who
has
fallen
victim
to
her
folly
next
door
at
which
isabella
violently
shook
her
head
and
caroline
observed
it
is
the
excitement
which
has
been
too
much
for
me
i
am
never
strong
and
this
is
such
a
dreadful
when
will
father
and
franklin
come
back
it
was
very
unkind
of
them
to
go
off
without
one
word
of
encouragement
they
probably
did
not
consider
the
fate
of
this
unknown
woman
a
matter
of
any
importance
to
you
the
van
burnam
girls
were
unlike
in
appearance
and
character
but
they
showed
an
equal
embarrassment
at
this
casting
down
their
eyes
and
behaving
so
strangely
that
i
was
driven
to
wonder
without
any
show
of
hysterics
i
am
happy
to
say
what
would
be
the
upshot
of
this
matter
and
how
far
i
would
become
involved
in
it
before
the
truth
came
to
light
at
dinner
they
displayed
what
i
should
call
their
best
society
manner
seeing
this
i
assumed
my
society
manner
also
it
is
formed
on
a
different
pattern
from
theirs
but
is
fully
as
impressive
i
judge
a
most
formal
meal
was
the
result
my
best
china
was
in
use
but
i
had
added
nothing
to
my
usual
course
of
viands
indeed
i
had
abstracted
something
an
upon
which
my
cook
prides
herself
was
omitted
was
i
going
to
allow
these
proud
young
misses
to
think
i
had
exerted
myself
to
please
them
no
rather
would
i
have
them
consider
me
niggardly
and
an
enemy
to
good
living
so
the
was
as
the
french
say
suppressed
in
the
evening
their
father
came
in
he
was
looking
very
dejected
and
half
his
bluster
was
gone
he
held
a
telegram
crushed
in
his
hand
and
he
talked
very
rapidly
but
he
confided
none
of
his
secrets
to
me
and
i
was
obliged
to
say
to
these
young
ladies
without
knowing
much
more
about
the
matter
engrossing
us
than
when
i
left
their
house
in
the
afternoon
but
others
were
not
as
ignorant
as
myself
a
dramatic
and
highly
exciting
scene
had
taken
place
that
evening
at
the
undertaker
to
which
the
unknown
body
had
been
removed
and
as
i
have
more
than
once
heard
it
minutely
described
i
will
endeavor
to
transcribe
it
here
with
all
the
impartiality
of
an
outsider
when
gryce
entered
the
carriage
in
which
howard
sat
he
noted
first
that
the
young
man
was
frightened
and
secondly
that
he
made
no
effort
to
hide
it
he
had
heard
almost
nothing
from
the
detective
he
knew
that
there
had
been
a
hue
and
cry
for
him
ever
since
noon
and
that
he
was
wanted
to
identify
a
young
woman
who
had
been
found
dead
in
his
house
but
beyond
these
facts
he
had
been
told
little
and
yet
he
seemed
to
have
no
curiosity
nor
did
he
venture
to
express
any
surprise
he
merely
accepted
the
situation
and
was
troubled
by
it
showing
no
inclination
to
talk
till
very
near
the
end
of
his
destination
when
he
suddenly
pulled
himself
together
and
ventured
this
question
how
did
she
the
young
woman
as
you
call
her
kill
herself
the
detective
who
in
his
long
career
among
criminals
and
suspected
persons
had
seen
many
men
and
encountered
many
conditions
roused
at
this
query
with
much
of
his
old
spirit
turning
from
the
man
rather
than
toward
him
he
allowed
himself
a
slight
shrug
of
the
shoulders
as
he
calmly
replied
she
was
found
under
a
heavy
piece
of
furniture
the
cabinet
with
the
vases
on
it
which
you
must
remember
stood
at
the
left
of
the
it
had
crushed
her
head
and
breast
quite
a
remarkable
means
of
death
do
you
think
there
has
been
but
one
occurrence
like
it
in
my
long
experience
i
do
believe
what
you
tell
me
was
the
young
man
astonishing
reply
you
are
trying
to
frighten
me
or
to
make
game
of
me
no
lady
would
make
use
of
any
such
means
of
death
as
that
i
did
not
say
she
was
a
lady
returned
gryce
scoring
one
in
his
mind
against
his
unwary
companion
a
quiver
passed
down
the
young
man
side
where
he
came
in
contact
with
the
detective
no
he
muttered
but
i
gathered
from
what
you
said
she
was
no
common
person
or
why
he
flashed
out
in
sudden
heat
do
you
require
me
to
go
with
you
to
see
her
have
i
the
name
of
associating
with
any
persons
of
the
sex
who
are
not
ladies
pardon
me
said
gryce
in
grim
delight
at
the
prospect
he
saw
slowly
unfolding
before
him
of
one
of
those
complicated
affairs
in
which
minds
like
his
unconsciously
revel
i
meant
no
insinuations
we
have
requested
you
as
we
have
requested
your
father
and
brother
to
accompany
us
to
the
undertaker
because
the
identification
of
the
corpse
is
a
most
important
point
and
every
formality
likely
to
insure
it
must
be
observed
and
did
not
they
my
father
and
brother
i
mean
recognize
her
it
would
be
difficult
for
any
one
to
recognize
her
who
was
not
well
acquainted
with
her
a
horrified
look
crossed
the
features
of
howard
van
burnam
which
if
a
part
of
his
acting
showed
him
to
have
genius
for
his
his
head
sank
back
on
the
cushions
of
the
carriage
and
for
a
moment
he
closed
his
eyes
when
he
opened
them
again
the
carriage
had
stopped
and
gryce
who
had
not
noticed
his
emotion
of
course
was
looking
out
of
the
window
with
his
hand
on
the
handle
of
the
door
are
we
there
already
asked
the
young
man
with
a
shudder
i
wish
you
had
not
considered
it
necessary
for
me
to
see
her
i
shall
detect
nothing
familiar
in
her
i
know
gryce
bowed
repeated
that
it
was
a
mere
formality
and
followed
the
young
gentleman
into
the
building
and
afterwards
into
the
room
where
the
dead
body
lay
a
couple
of
doctors
and
one
or
two
officials
stood
about
in
whose
faces
the
young
man
sought
for
something
like
encouragement
before
casting
his
eyes
in
the
direction
indicated
by
the
detective
but
there
was
little
in
any
of
these
faces
to
calm
him
and
turning
shortly
away
he
walked
manfully
across
the
room
and
took
his
stand
by
the
detective
i
am
positive
he
began
that
it
is
not
my
wife
at
this
moment
the
cloth
that
covered
the
body
was
removed
and
he
gave
a
great
start
of
relief
i
said
so
he
remarked
coldly
this
is
no
one
i
know
his
sigh
was
echoed
in
double
chorus
from
the
doorway
glancing
that
way
he
encountered
the
faces
of
his
father
and
elder
brother
and
moved
towards
them
with
a
relieved
air
that
made
quite
another
man
of
him
in
appearance
i
have
had
my
say
he
remarked
shall
i
wait
outside
till
you
have
had
yours
we
have
already
said
all
that
we
had
to
franklin
returned
we
declared
that
we
did
not
recognize
this
person
of
course
of
course
assented
the
other
i
do
see
why
they
should
have
expected
us
to
know
her
some
common
suicide
who
thought
the
house
empty
but
how
did
she
get
in
do
you
know
said
gryce
can
it
be
that
i
forgot
to
tell
you
why
she
was
let
in
at
night
by
a
young
man
of
medium
height
his
eye
ran
up
and
down
the
graceful
figure
of
the
young
before
him
as
he
spoke
who
left
her
inside
and
then
went
away
a
young
man
who
had
a
key
a
franklin
i
was
it
a
look
from
franklin
which
made
him
stop
it
is
possible
for
he
turned
on
his
heel
as
he
reached
this
point
and
tossing
his
head
with
quite
a
gay
air
exclaimed
but
it
is
of
no
consequence
the
girl
is
a
stranger
and
we
have
satisfied
i
believe
all
the
requirements
of
the
law
in
saying
so
and
may
now
drop
the
matter
are
you
going
to
the
club
franklin
yes
but
here
the
elder
brother
drew
nearer
and
whispered
something
into
the
other
ear
who
at
that
whisper
turned
again
towards
the
place
where
the
dead
woman
lay
seeing
this
movement
his
anxious
father
wiped
the
moisture
from
his
forehead
silas
van
burnam
had
been
silent
up
to
this
moment
and
seemed
inclined
to
continue
so
but
he
watched
his
younger
son
with
painful
intentness
nonsense
broke
from
howard
lips
as
his
brother
ceased
his
communication
but
he
took
a
step
nearer
the
body
notwithstanding
and
then
another
and
another
till
he
was
at
its
side
again
the
hands
had
not
been
injured
as
we
have
said
and
upon
these
his
eyes
now
fell
they
are
like
hers
o
god
they
are
like
hers
he
muttered
growing
gloomy
at
once
but
where
are
the
rings
there
are
no
rings
to
be
seen
on
these
fingers
and
she
wore
five
including
her
is
it
of
your
wife
you
are
speaking
inquired
gryce
who
had
edged
up
close
to
his
side
the
young
man
was
caught
unawares
he
flushed
deeply
but
answered
up
boldly
and
with
great
appearance
of
candor
yes
my
wife
left
haddam
yesterday
to
come
to
new
york
and
i
have
not
seen
her
since
naturally
i
have
felt
some
doubts
lest
this
unhappy
victim
should
be
she
but
i
do
not
recognize
her
clothing
i
do
not
recognize
her
form
only
the
hands
look
familiar
and
the
hair
is
of
the
same
color
as
hers
but
it
a
very
ordinary
color
i
do
not
dare
to
say
from
anything
i
see
that
this
is
my
wife
we
will
call
you
again
after
the
doctor
has
finished
his
autopsy
said
gryce
perhaps
you
will
hear
from
van
burnam
before
then
but
this
intimation
did
not
seem
to
bring
comfort
with
it
van
burnam
walked
away
white
and
sick
for
which
display
of
emotion
there
was
certainly
some
cause
and
rejoining
his
father
tried
to
carry
off
the
moment
with
the
of
a
man
of
the
world
but
that
father
eye
was
fixed
too
steadily
upon
him
he
faltered
as
he
sat
down
and
finally
spoke
up
with
feverish
energy
if
it
is
she
so
help
me
god
her
death
is
a
mystery
to
me
we
have
quarrelled
more
than
once
lately
and
i
have
sometimes
lost
my
patience
with
her
but
she
had
no
reason
to
wish
for
death
and
i
am
ready
to
swear
in
defiance
of
those
hands
which
are
certainly
like
hers
and
the
nameless
something
which
franklin
calls
a
likeness
that
it
is
a
stranger
who
lies
there
and
that
her
death
in
our
house
is
a
coincidence
well
well
we
will
wait
was
the
detective
soothing
reply
sit
down
in
the
room
opposite
there
and
give
me
your
orders
for
supper
and
i
will
see
that
a
good
meal
is
served
you
the
three
gentlemen
seeing
no
way
of
refusing
followed
the
discreet
official
who
preceded
them
and
the
door
of
the
doctor
room
closed
upon
him
and
the
inquiries
he
was
about
to
make
vi
new
facts
van
burnam
and
his
sons
had
gone
through
the
formality
of
a
supper
and
were
conversing
in
the
haphazard
way
natural
to
men
filled
with
a
subject
they
dare
not
discuss
when
the
door
opened
and
gryce
came
in
advancing
very
calmly
he
addressed
himself
to
the
father
i
am
sorry
said
he
to
be
obliged
to
inform
you
that
this
affair
is
much
more
serious
than
we
anticipated
this
young
woman
was
dead
before
the
shelves
laden
with
fell
upon
her
it
is
a
case
of
murder
obviously
so
or
i
should
not
presume
to
forestall
the
jury
in
their
verdict
murder
it
is
a
word
to
shake
the
stoutest
heart
the
older
gentleman
reeled
as
he
half
rose
and
franklin
his
son
betrayed
in
his
own
way
an
almost
equal
amount
of
emotion
but
howard
shrugging
his
shoulders
as
if
relieved
of
an
immense
weight
looked
about
with
a
cheerful
air
and
briskly
cried
then
it
is
not
the
body
of
my
wife
you
have
there
no
one
would
murder
louise
i
shall
go
away
and
prove
the
truth
of
my
words
by
hunting
her
up
at
once
the
detective
opened
the
door
beckoned
in
the
doctor
who
whispered
two
or
three
words
into
howard
ear
they
failed
to
awake
the
emotion
he
evidently
expected
howard
looked
surprised
but
answered
without
any
change
of
voice
yes
louise
had
such
a
scar
and
if
it
is
true
that
this
woman
is
similarly
marked
then
it
is
a
mere
coincidence
nothing
will
convince
me
that
my
wife
has
been
the
victim
of
murder
had
you
not
better
take
a
look
at
the
scar
just
mentioned
no
i
am
so
sure
of
what
i
say
that
i
will
not
even
consider
the
possibility
of
my
being
mistaken
i
have
examined
the
clothing
on
this
body
you
have
shown
me
and
not
one
article
of
it
came
from
my
wardrobe
nor
would
my
wife
go
as
you
have
informed
me
this
woman
did
into
a
dark
house
at
night
with
any
other
man
than
her
husband
and
so
you
absolutely
refuse
to
acknowledge
her
most
certainly
the
detective
paused
glanced
at
the
troubled
faces
of
the
other
two
gentlemen
faces
that
had
not
perceptibly
altered
during
these
declarations
and
suggestively
remarked
you
have
not
asked
by
what
means
she
was
killed
and
i
do
care
shouted
howard
it
was
by
very
peculiar
means
also
new
in
my
experience
it
does
not
interest
me
the
other
retorted
gryce
turned
to
his
father
and
brother
does
it
interest
he
asked
the
old
gentleman
ordinarily
so
testy
and
so
peremptory
silently
nodded
his
head
while
franklin
cried
speak
up
quick
you
detectives
hesitate
so
over
the
disagreeables
was
she
throttled
or
stabbed
with
a
knife
i
have
said
the
means
were
peculiar
she
was
stabbed
but
not
with
a
knife
i
know
gryce
well
enough
now
to
be
sure
that
he
did
not
glance
towards
howard
while
saying
this
and
yet
at
the
same
time
that
he
did
not
miss
the
quiver
of
a
muscle
on
his
part
or
the
motion
of
an
eyelash
but
howard
assumed
remained
undisturbed
and
his
countenance
imperturbable
the
wound
was
so
small
the
detective
went
on
that
it
is
a
miracle
it
did
not
escape
notice
it
was
made
by
the
thrust
of
some
very
slender
instrument
through
the
heart
put
in
franklin
of
course
of
course
assented
the
detective
what
other
spot
is
vulnerable
enough
to
cause
death
is
there
any
reason
why
we
should
not
go
demanded
howard
ignoring
the
extreme
interest
manifested
by
the
other
two
with
a
determination
that
showed
great
doggedness
of
character
the
detective
ignored
a
quick
stroke
a
sure
stroke
a
fatal
stroke
the
girl
never
breathed
after
but
what
of
those
things
under
which
she
lay
crushed
ah
in
them
lies
the
mystery
her
assailant
must
have
been
as
subtle
as
he
was
sure
and
still
howard
showed
no
interest
i
wish
to
telegraph
to
haddam
he
declared
as
no
one
answered
the
last
remark
haddam
was
the
place
where
he
and
his
wife
had
been
spending
the
summer
we
have
already
telegraphed
there
observed
gryce
your
wife
has
not
yet
returned
there
are
other
places
defiantly
insisted
the
other
i
can
find
her
if
you
give
me
the
opportunity
gryce
bowed
i
am
to
give
orders
then
for
this
body
to
be
removed
to
the
morgue
it
was
an
unexpected
suggestion
and
for
an
instant
howard
showed
that
he
had
feelings
with
the
best
but
he
quickly
recovered
himself
and
avoiding
the
anxious
glances
of
his
father
and
brother
answered
with
offensive
lightness
i
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
you
must
do
as
you
think
proper
and
gryce
felt
that
he
had
received
a
check
and
did
not
know
whether
to
admire
the
young
man
for
his
nerve
or
to
execrate
him
for
his
brutality
that
the
woman
whom
he
had
thus
carelessly
dismissed
to
the
ignominy
of
the
public
gaze
was
his
wife
the
detective
did
not
doubt
vii
gryce
discovers
miss
amelia
to
return
to
my
own
observations
i
was
almost
as
ignorant
of
what
i
wanted
to
know
at
ten
on
that
memorable
night
as
i
was
at
five
but
i
was
determined
not
to
remain
so
when
the
two
misses
van
burnam
had
retired
to
their
room
i
slipped
away
to
the
neighboring
house
and
boldly
rang
the
bell
i
had
observed
gryce
enter
it
a
few
minutes
before
and
i
was
resolved
to
have
some
talk
with
him
the
was
lit
and
we
could
discern
each
other
faces
as
he
opened
the
door
mine
may
have
been
a
study
but
i
am
sure
his
was
he
had
not
expected
to
be
confronted
by
an
elderly
lady
at
that
hour
of
night
well
he
dryly
ejaculated
i
am
sensible
of
the
honor
miss
butterworth
but
he
did
not
ask
me
in
i
expected
no
less
said
i
i
saw
you
come
in
and
i
followed
as
soon
after
as
i
could
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
he
admitted
me
then
and
carefully
closed
the
door
feeling
free
to
be
myself
i
threw
off
the
veil
i
had
tied
under
my
chin
and
confronted
him
with
what
i
call
the
true
spirit
gryce
i
began
let
us
make
an
exchange
of
civilities
tell
me
what
you
have
done
with
howard
van
burnam
and
i
will
tell
you
what
i
have
observed
in
the
course
of
this
afternoon
investigation
this
aged
detective
is
used
to
women
i
have
no
doubt
but
he
is
not
used
to
i
saw
it
by
the
way
he
turned
over
and
over
the
spectacles
he
held
in
his
hand
i
made
an
effort
to
help
him
out
i
have
noted
something
which
i
think
has
escaped
it
is
so
slight
a
clue
that
most
women
would
not
speak
of
it
but
being
interested
in
the
case
i
will
mention
it
if
in
return
you
will
acquaint
me
with
what
will
appear
in
the
papers
he
seemed
to
like
it
he
peered
through
his
glasses
and
at
them
with
the
smile
of
a
discoverer
i
am
your
very
humble
servant
he
declared
and
i
felt
as
if
my
father
daughter
had
received
her
first
recognition
but
he
did
not
overwhelm
me
with
confidences
o
no
he
is
very
sly
this
old
and
detective
and
while
appearing
to
be
very
communicative
really
parted
with
but
little
information
he
said
enough
however
for
me
to
gather
that
matters
looked
grim
for
howard
and
if
this
was
so
it
must
have
become
apparent
that
the
death
they
were
investigating
was
neither
an
accident
nor
a
suicide
i
hinted
as
much
and
he
for
his
own
ends
no
doubt
admitted
at
last
that
a
wound
had
been
found
on
the
young
woman
which
could
not
have
been
inflicted
by
herself
at
which
i
felt
such
increased
interest
in
this
remarkable
murder
that
i
must
have
made
some
foolish
display
of
it
for
the
wary
old
gentleman
chuckled
and
ogled
his
spectacles
quite
lovingly
before
shutting
them
up
and
putting
them
into
his
pocket
and
now
what
have
you
to
tell
me
he
inquired
sliding
softly
between
me
and
the
parlor
door
nothing
but
this
question
that
closely
she
has
something
to
tell
which
it
is
your
business
to
know
i
think
he
was
disappointed
he
looked
as
if
he
regretted
the
spectacles
he
had
pocketed
and
when
he
spoke
there
was
an
edge
to
his
tone
i
had
not
noticed
in
it
before
do
you
know
what
that
something
is
he
asked
no
or
i
should
tell
you
myself
and
what
makes
you
think
she
is
hiding
anything
from
us
her
manner
did
you
not
notice
her
manner
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
conveyed
much
to
me
i
insisted
if
i
were
a
detective
i
would
have
the
secret
out
of
that
woman
or
die
in
the
attempt
he
laughed
this
sly
old
almost
decrepit
man
laughed
outright
then
he
looked
severely
at
his
old
friend
on
the
and
drawing
himself
up
with
some
show
of
dignity
made
this
remark
it
is
my
very
good
fortune
to
have
made
your
acquaintance
miss
butterworth
you
and
i
ought
to
be
able
to
work
out
this
case
in
a
way
that
will
be
satisfactory
to
all
parties
he
meant
it
for
sarcasm
but
i
took
it
quite
seriously
that
is
to
all
appearance
i
am
as
sly
as
he
and
though
not
quite
as
old
now
am
sarcastic
have
some
of
his
wits
if
but
little
of
his
experience
then
let
us
to
work
said
i
you
have
your
theories
about
this
murder
and
i
have
mine
let
us
see
how
they
compare
if
the
image
he
had
under
his
eye
had
not
been
made
of
bronze
i
am
sure
it
would
have
become
petrified
by
the
look
he
now
gave
it
what
to
me
seemed
but
the
natural
proposition
of
an
energetic
woman
with
a
special
genius
for
his
particular
calling
evidently
struck
him
as
audacity
of
the
grossest
kind
but
he
confined
his
display
of
astonishment
to
the
figure
he
was
eying
and
returned
me
nothing
but
this
most
gentlemanly
retort
i
am
sure
i
am
obliged
to
you
madam
and
possibly
i
may
be
willing
to
consider
your
very
thoughtful
proposition
later
but
now
i
am
busy
very
busy
and
if
you
will
await
my
presence
in
your
house
for
a
half
hour
why
not
let
me
wait
here
i
interposed
the
atmosphere
of
the
place
may
sharpen
my
faculties
i
already
feel
that
another
sharp
look
into
that
parlor
would
lead
to
the
forming
of
some
valuable
theory
you
well
he
did
not
say
what
i
was
or
rather
what
the
image
he
was
apostrophizing
was
but
he
must
have
meant
to
utter
a
compliment
of
no
common
order
the
prim
courtesy
i
made
in
acknowledgment
of
his
good
intention
satisfied
him
that
i
had
understood
him
fully
and
changing
his
whole
manner
to
one
more
in
accordance
with
business
he
observed
after
a
moment
reflection
you
came
to
a
conclusion
this
afternoon
miss
butterworth
for
which
i
should
like
some
explanation
in
investigating
the
hat
which
had
been
drawn
from
under
the
murdered
girl
remains
you
made
the
remark
that
it
had
been
worn
but
once
i
had
already
come
to
the
same
conclusion
but
by
other
means
doubtless
will
you
tell
me
what
it
was
that
gave
point
to
your
assertion
there
was
but
one
prick
of
a
in
it
i
observed
if
you
have
been
in
the
habit
of
looking
into
young
women
hats
you
will
appreciate
the
force
of
my
remark
the
deuce
was
his
certainly
uncalled
for
exclamation
women
eyes
for
women
matters
i
am
greatly
indebted
to
you
you
have
solved
a
very
important
problem
for
us
a
humph
he
muttered
to
himself
the
devil
in
a
man
is
not
easily
balked
even
such
an
innocent
article
as
that
can
be
made
to
serve
when
all
other
means
are
lacking
it
is
perhaps
a
proof
that
gryce
is
getting
old
that
he
allowed
these
words
to
escape
him
but
having
once
given
vent
to
them
he
made
no
effort
to
retract
them
but
proceeded
to
take
me
into
his
confidence
so
far
as
to
explain
the
woman
who
was
killed
in
that
room
owed
her
death
to
the
stab
of
a
thin
long
pin
we
had
not
thought
of
a
but
upon
your
mentioning
it
i
am
ready
to
accept
it
as
the
instrument
of
death
there
was
no
pin
to
be
seen
in
the
hat
when
you
looked
at
it
none
i
examined
it
most
carefully
he
shook
his
head
and
seemed
to
be
meditating
as
i
had
plenty
of
time
i
waited
expecting
him
to
speak
again
my
patience
seemed
to
impress
him
alternately
raising
and
lowering
his
hands
like
one
in
the
act
of
weighing
something
he
soon
addressed
me
again
this
time
in
a
tone
of
banter
this
pin
if
pin
it
was
was
found
broken
in
the
wound
we
have
been
searching
for
the
end
that
was
left
in
the
murderer
hand
and
we
have
not
found
it
it
is
not
on
the
floors
of
the
parlors
nor
in
this
hallway
what
do
you
think
the
ingenious
user
of
such
an
instrument
would
do
with
it
this
was
said
i
am
now
sure
out
of
a
spirit
of
sarcasm
he
was
amusing
himself
with
me
but
i
did
not
realize
it
then
i
was
too
full
of
my
subject
he
would
not
have
carried
it
away
i
reasoned
shortly
at
least
not
far
he
did
not
throw
it
aside
on
reaching
the
street
for
i
watched
his
movements
so
closely
that
i
would
have
observed
him
had
he
done
this
it
is
in
the
house
then
and
presumably
in
the
parlor
even
if
you
do
not
find
it
on
the
floor
would
you
like
to
look
for
it
he
impressively
asked
i
had
no
means
of
knowing
at
that
time
that
when
he
was
impressive
he
was
his
least
candid
and
trustworthy
self
would
i
i
repeated
and
being
spare
in
figure
and
much
more
active
in
my
movements
that
one
would
suppose
from
my
age
and
dignified
deportment
i
ducked
under
his
arms
and
was
in
van
burnam
parlor
before
he
had
recovered
from
his
surprise
that
a
man
like
him
could
look
foolish
i
would
not
have
you
for
a
moment
suppose
but
he
did
not
look
very
well
satisfied
and
i
had
a
chance
to
throw
more
than
one
glance
around
me
before
he
found
his
tongue
again
an
unfair
advantage
an
unfair
advantage
i
am
old
and
i
am
rheumatic
you
are
young
and
sound
as
a
nut
i
acknowledge
my
folly
in
endeavoring
to
compete
with
you
and
must
make
the
best
of
the
situation
and
now
madam
where
is
that
pin
it
was
lightly
said
but
for
all
that
i
saw
that
my
opportunity
had
come
if
i
could
find
this
instrument
of
murder
what
might
i
not
expect
from
his
gratitude
nerving
myself
for
the
task
thus
set
me
i
peered
hither
and
thither
taking
in
every
article
in
the
room
before
i
made
a
step
forward
there
had
been
some
attempt
to
rectify
its
disorder
the
broken
pieces
of
china
had
been
lifted
and
laid
carefully
away
on
newspapers
upon
the
shelves
from
which
they
had
fallen
the
cabinet
stood
upright
in
its
place
and
the
clock
which
had
tumbled
face
upward
had
been
placed
upon
the
mantel
shelf
in
the
same
position
the
carpet
was
therefore
free
save
for
the
stains
which
told
such
a
woful
story
of
past
tragedy
and
crime
you
have
moved
the
tables
and
searched
behind
the
sofas
i
suggested
not
an
inch
of
the
floor
has
escaped
our
attention
madam
my
eyes
fell
on
the
register
which
my
skirts
half
covered
it
was
closed
i
stooped
and
opened
it
a
square
box
of
tin
was
visible
below
at
the
bottom
of
which
i
perceived
the
round
head
of
a
broken
never
in
my
life
had
i
felt
as
i
did
at
that
minute
rising
up
i
pointed
at
the
register
and
let
some
of
my
triumph
become
apparent
but
not
all
for
i
was
by
no
means
sure
at
that
moment
nor
am
i
by
any
means
sure
now
that
he
had
not
made
the
discovery
before
i
did
and
was
simply
testing
my
pretensions
however
that
may
be
he
came
forward
quickly
and
after
some
little
effort
drew
out
the
broken
pin
and
examined
it
curiously
i
should
say
that
this
is
what
we
want
he
declared
and
from
that
moment
on
showed
me
a
suitable
deference
i
account
for
its
being
there
in
this
way
i
argued
the
room
was
dark
for
whether
he
lighted
it
or
not
to
commit
his
crime
he
certainly
did
not
leave
it
lighted
long
coming
out
his
foot
came
in
contact
with
the
iron
of
the
register
and
he
was
struck
by
a
sudden
thought
he
had
not
dared
to
leave
the
head
of
the
pin
lying
on
the
floor
for
he
hoped
that
he
had
covered
up
his
crime
by
pulling
the
heavy
cabinet
over
upon
his
victim
nor
did
he
wish
to
carry
away
such
a
memento
of
his
cruel
deed
so
he
dropped
it
down
the
register
where
he
doubtless
expected
it
would
fall
into
the
furnace
pipes
out
of
sight
but
the
tin
box
retained
it
is
not
that
plausible
sir
i
could
not
have
reasoned
better
myself
madam
we
shall
have
you
on
the
force
yet
but
at
the
familiarity
shown
by
this
suggestion
i
bridled
angrily
i
am
miss
butterworth
was
my
sharp
retort
and
any
interest
i
may
take
in
this
matter
is
due
to
my
sense
of
justice
seeing
that
he
had
offended
me
the
astute
detective
turned
the
conversation
back
to
business
by
the
way
said
he
your
woman
knowledge
can
help
me
out
at
another
point
if
you
are
not
afraid
to
remain
in
this
room
alone
for
a
moment
i
will
bring
an
article
in
regard
to
which
i
should
like
your
opinion
i
assured
him
i
was
not
in
the
least
bit
afraid
at
which
he
made
me
another
of
his
anomalous
bows
and
passed
into
the
adjoining
parlor
he
did
not
stop
there
opening
the
communicating
with
the
beyond
he
disappeared
in
the
latter
room
shutting
the
doors
behind
him
being
now
alone
for
a
moment
on
the
scene
of
crime
i
crossed
over
to
the
and
lifted
the
clock
that
lay
there
why
i
did
this
i
scarcely
know
i
am
naturally
very
orderly
some
people
call
me
precise
and
it
probably
fretted
me
to
see
so
valuable
an
object
out
of
its
natural
position
however
that
was
i
lifted
it
up
and
set
it
upright
when
to
my
amazement
it
began
to
tick
had
the
hands
not
stood
as
they
did
when
my
eyes
first
fell
on
the
clock
lying
face
up
on
the
floor
at
the
dead
girl
side
i
should
have
thought
the
works
had
been
started
since
that
time
by
gryce
or
some
other
officious
person
but
they
pointed
now
as
then
to
a
few
minutes
before
five
and
the
only
conclusion
i
could
arrive
at
was
that
the
clock
had
been
in
running
order
when
it
fell
startling
as
this
fact
appeared
in
a
house
which
had
not
been
inhabited
for
months
but
if
it
had
been
in
running
order
and
was
only
stopped
by
its
fall
upon
the
floor
why
did
the
hands
point
at
five
instead
of
twelve
which
was
the
hour
at
which
the
accident
was
supposed
to
have
happened
here
was
matter
for
thought
and
that
i
might
be
undisturbed
in
my
use
of
it
i
hastened
to
lay
the
clock
down
again
even
taking
the
precaution
to
restore
the
hands
to
the
exact
position
they
had
occupied
before
i
had
started
up
the
works
if
gryce
did
not
know
their
secret
why
so
much
the
worse
for
gryce
i
was
back
in
my
old
place
by
the
register
before
the
unclosed
again
i
was
conscious
of
a
slight
flush
on
my
cheek
so
i
took
from
my
pocket
that
perplexing
and
was
laboriously
going
down
its
long
line
of
figures
when
gryce
reappeared
he
had
to
my
surprise
a
woman
hat
in
his
hand
well
thought
i
what
does
this
mean
it
was
an
elegant
specimen
of
millinery
and
was
in
the
latest
style
it
had
ribbons
and
flowers
and
bird
wings
upon
it
and
presented
as
it
was
turned
about
by
gryce
deft
hand
an
appearance
which
some
might
have
called
charming
but
to
me
was
simply
grotesque
and
absurd
is
that
a
last
spring
hat
he
inquired
i
do
know
but
i
should
say
it
had
come
fresh
from
the
milliner
i
found
it
lying
with
a
pair
of
gloves
tucked
inside
it
on
an
otherwise
empty
shelf
in
the
closet
it
struck
me
as
looking
too
new
for
a
discarded
hat
of
either
of
the
misses
van
burnam
what
do
you
think
let
me
take
it
said
i
o
it
been
worn
he
smiled
several
times
and
the
is
in
it
too
there
is
something
else
i
wish
to
see
he
handed
it
over
i
think
it
belongs
to
one
of
them
i
declared
it
was
made
by
la
mole
of
fifth
avenue
whose
prices
are
simply
wicked
but
the
young
ladies
have
been
gone
let
me
see
five
months
could
this
have
been
bought
before
then
possibly
for
this
is
an
imported
hat
but
why
should
it
have
been
left
lying
about
in
that
careless
way
it
cost
twenty
dollars
if
not
thirty
and
if
for
any
reason
its
owner
decided
not
to
take
it
with
her
why
did
she
pack
it
away
properly
i
have
no
patience
with
the
modern
girl
she
is
made
up
of
recklessness
and
extravagance
i
hear
that
the
young
ladies
are
staying
with
you
was
his
suggestive
remark
they
are
then
you
can
make
some
inquiries
about
this
hat
also
about
the
gloves
which
are
an
ordinary
street
pair
of
what
color
grey
they
are
quite
fresh
size
six
very
well
i
will
ask
the
young
ladies
about
them
this
third
room
is
used
as
a
and
the
closet
where
i
found
them
is
one
in
which
glass
is
kept
the
presence
of
this
hat
there
is
a
mystery
but
i
presume
the
misses
van
burnam
can
solve
it
at
all
events
it
is
very
improbable
that
it
has
anything
to
do
with
the
crime
which
has
been
committed
here
very
i
coincided
so
improbable
he
went
on
that
on
second
thoughts
i
advise
you
not
to
disturb
the
young
ladies
with
questions
concerning
it
unless
further
reasons
for
doing
so
become
apparent
very
well
i
returned
but
i
was
not
deceived
by
his
second
thoughts
as
he
was
holding
open
the
parlor
door
before
me
in
a
very
significant
way
i
tied
my
veil
under
my
chin
and
was
about
to
leave
when
he
stopped
me
i
have
another
favor
to
ask
said
he
and
this
time
with
his
most
benignant
smile
miss
butterworth
do
you
object
to
sitting
up
for
a
few
nights
till
twelve
not
at
all
i
returned
if
there
is
any
good
reason
for
it
at
twelve
a
gentleman
will
enter
this
house
if
you
will
note
him
from
your
window
i
will
be
obliged
to
see
whether
he
is
the
same
one
i
saw
last
night
certainly
i
will
take
a
look
but
night
he
went
on
imperturbably
the
test
will
be
repeated
and
i
should
like
to
have
you
take
another
look
without
prejudice
madam
remember
without
prejudice
i
have
no
prejudices
i
began
the
test
may
not
be
concluded
in
two
nights
he
proceeded
without
any
notice
of
my
words
so
do
not
be
in
haste
to
spot
your
man
as
the
vulgar
expression
is
and
now
we
shall
meet
again
wait
i
called
peremptorily
for
he
was
on
the
point
of
closing
the
door
i
saw
the
man
but
faintly
it
is
an
impression
only
that
i
received
i
would
not
wish
a
man
to
hang
through
any
identification
i
could
make
no
man
hangs
on
simple
identification
we
shall
have
to
prove
the
crime
madam
but
identification
is
important
even
such
as
you
can
make
there
was
no
more
to
be
said
i
uttered
a
calm
and
hastened
away
by
a
judicious
use
of
my
opportunities
i
had
become
much
less
ignorant
on
the
topic
than
when
i
entered
the
house
it
was
half
past
eleven
when
i
returned
home
a
late
hour
for
me
to
enter
my
respectable
front
door
alone
but
circumstances
had
warranted
my
escapade
and
it
was
with
quite
an
easy
conscience
and
a
cheerful
sense
of
accomplishment
that
i
went
up
to
my
room
and
prepared
to
sit
out
the
half
hour
before
midnight
i
am
a
comfortable
sort
of
person
when
alone
and
found
no
difficulty
in
passing
this
time
profitably
being
very
orderly
as
you
must
have
remarked
i
have
everything
at
hand
for
making
myself
a
cup
of
tea
at
any
time
of
day
or
night
so
feeling
some
need
of
refreshment
i
set
out
the
little
table
i
reserve
for
such
purposes
and
made
the
tea
and
sat
down
to
sip
it
while
doing
so
i
turned
over
the
subject
occupying
my
mind
and
endeavored
to
reconcile
the
story
told
by
the
clock
with
my
preconceived
theory
of
this
murder
but
no
reconcilement
was
possible
the
woman
had
been
killed
at
twelve
and
the
clock
had
fallen
at
five
how
could
the
two
be
made
to
agree
and
which
since
agreement
was
impossible
should
be
made
to
give
way
the
theory
or
the
testimony
of
the
clock
both
seemed
incontrovertible
and
yet
one
must
be
false
which
i
was
inclined
to
think
that
the
trouble
lay
with
the
clock
that
i
had
been
deceived
in
my
conclusions
and
that
it
was
not
running
at
the
time
of
the
crime
gryce
may
have
ordered
it
wound
and
then
have
had
it
laid
on
its
back
to
prevent
the
hands
from
shifting
past
the
point
where
they
had
stood
at
the
time
of
the
crime
discovery
it
was
an
unexplainable
act
but
a
possible
one
while
to
suppose
that
it
was
going
when
the
shelves
fell
stretched
improbability
to
the
utmost
there
having
been
so
far
as
we
could
learn
no
one
in
the
house
for
months
sufficiently
dexterous
to
set
so
valuable
a
timepiece
for
who
could
imagine
the
engaging
in
a
task
requiring
such
delicate
manipulation
no
some
meddlesome
official
had
amused
himself
by
starting
up
the
works
and
the
clue
i
had
thought
so
important
would
probably
prove
valueless
there
was
humiliation
in
the
thought
and
it
was
a
relief
to
me
to
hear
an
approaching
carriage
just
as
the
clock
on
my
mantel
struck
twelve
springing
from
my
chair
i
put
out
my
light
and
flew
to
the
window
the
coach
drew
up
and
stopped
next
door
i
saw
a
gentleman
descend
and
step
briskly
across
the
pavement
to
the
neighboring
stoop
the
figure
he
presented
was
not
that
of
the
man
i
had
seen
enter
the
night
before
viii
the
misses
van
burnam
late
as
it
was
when
i
retired
i
was
up
betimes
in
the
morning
as
soon
in
fact
as
the
papers
were
distributed
the
lay
on
the
stoop
eagerly
i
seized
it
eagerly
i
read
it
from
its
headlines
you
may
judge
what
it
had
to
say
about
this
murder
a
startling
discovery
in
the
van
burnam
mansion
in
gramercy
park
a
young
girl
found
there
lying
dead
under
an
overturned
cabinet
evidences
that
she
was
murdered
before
it
was
pulled
down
upon
her
thought
by
some
to
be
howard
van
burnam
a
fearful
crime
involved
in
an
impenetrable
mystery
what
van
burnam
says
about
it
he
does
not
recognize
the
woman
as
his
wife
so
so
it
was
his
wife
they
were
talking
about
i
had
not
expected
that
well
well
no
wonder
the
girls
looked
startled
and
concerned
and
i
paused
to
recall
what
i
had
heard
about
howard
van
burnam
marriage
it
had
not
been
a
fortunate
one
his
chosen
bride
was
pretty
enough
but
she
had
not
been
bred
in
the
ways
of
fashionable
society
and
the
other
members
of
the
family
had
never
recognized
her
the
father
especially
had
cut
his
son
dead
since
his
marriage
and
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
threaten
to
dissolve
the
partnership
in
which
they
were
all
involved
worse
than
this
there
had
been
rumors
of
a
disagreement
between
howard
and
his
wife
they
were
not
always
on
good
terms
and
opinions
differed
as
to
which
was
most
in
fault
so
much
for
what
i
knew
of
these
two
mentioned
parties
reading
the
article
at
length
i
learned
that
van
burnam
was
missing
that
she
had
left
haddam
for
new
york
the
day
before
her
husband
and
had
not
since
been
heard
from
howard
was
confident
however
that
the
publicity
given
to
her
disappearance
by
the
papers
would
bring
immediate
news
of
her
the
effect
of
the
whole
article
was
to
raise
grave
doubts
as
to
the
candor
of
van
burnam
assertions
and
i
am
told
that
in
some
of
the
less
scrupulous
papers
these
doubts
were
not
only
expressed
but
actual
surmises
ventured
upon
as
to
the
identity
between
the
person
whom
i
had
seen
enter
the
house
with
the
young
girl
as
for
my
own
name
it
was
blazoned
forth
in
anything
but
a
gratifying
manner
i
was
spoken
of
in
one
paper
a
kind
friend
told
me
this
as
the
prying
miss
amelia
as
if
my
prying
had
not
given
the
police
their
only
clue
to
the
identification
of
the
criminal
the
new
york
was
the
only
paper
that
treated
me
with
any
consideration
that
young
man
with
the
small
head
and
beady
eyes
was
not
awed
by
me
for
nothing
he
mentioned
me
as
the
clever
miss
butterworth
whose
testimony
is
likely
to
be
of
so
much
value
in
this
very
interesting
case
it
was
the
i
handed
the
misses
van
burnam
when
they
came
to
breakfast
it
did
justice
to
me
and
not
too
much
injustice
to
him
they
read
it
together
their
two
heads
plunged
deeply
into
the
paper
so
that
i
could
not
watch
their
faces
but
i
could
see
the
sheet
shake
and
i
noticed
that
their
social
veneer
was
not
as
yet
laid
on
so
thickly
that
they
could
hide
their
real
terror
and
when
they
finally
confronted
me
again
did
you
read
have
you
seen
this
horrible
account
quavered
caroline
as
she
met
my
eye
yes
and
i
now
understand
why
you
felt
such
anxiety
yesterday
did
you
know
your
and
do
you
think
she
could
have
been
beguiled
into
your
father
house
in
that
way
it
was
isabella
who
answered
we
never
have
seen
her
and
know
little
of
her
but
there
is
no
telling
what
such
an
uncultivated
person
as
she
might
do
but
that
our
good
brother
howard
ever
went
in
there
with
her
is
a
lie
is
it
caroline
a
base
and
malicious
lie
of
course
it
is
of
course
of
course
you
do
think
the
man
you
saw
was
howard
do
you
dear
miss
butterworth
o
dear
i
am
not
acquainted
with
your
brother
i
returned
i
have
never
seen
him
but
a
few
times
in
my
life
you
know
he
has
not
been
a
very
frequent
visitor
at
your
father
house
lately
they
looked
at
me
wistfully
wistfully
say
it
was
not
howard
whispered
caroline
stealing
up
a
little
nearer
to
my
side
and
we
will
never
forget
it
murmured
isabella
in
what
i
am
obliged
to
say
was
not
her
society
manner
i
hope
to
be
able
to
say
it
was
my
short
rejoinder
made
difficult
by
the
prejudices
i
had
formed
when
i
see
your
brother
i
may
be
able
to
decide
at
a
glance
that
the
person
i
saw
entering
your
house
was
not
he
yes
oh
yes
do
you
hear
that
isabella
miss
butterworth
will
save
howard
yet
o
you
dear
old
soul
i
could
almost
love
you
this
was
not
agreeable
to
me
i
a
dear
old
soul
a
term
to
be
applied
to
a
not
to
a
butterworth
i
drew
back
and
their
sentimentalities
came
to
an
end
i
hope
their
brother
howard
is
not
the
guilty
man
the
papers
make
him
out
to
be
but
if
he
is
the
misses
van
burnam
fine
phrase
could
almost
love
will
not
deter
me
from
being
honest
in
the
matter
gryce
called
early
and
i
was
glad
to
be
able
to
tell
him
that
the
gentleman
who
visited
him
the
night
before
did
not
recall
the
impression
made
upon
me
by
the
other
he
received
the
communication
quietly
and
from
his
manner
i
judged
that
it
was
more
or
less
expected
but
who
can
be
a
correct
judge
of
a
detective
manner
especially
one
so
foxy
and
imperturbable
as
this
one
i
longed
to
ask
who
his
visitor
was
but
i
did
not
dare
or
rather
to
be
candid
in
little
things
that
you
may
believe
me
in
great
i
was
confident
he
would
not
tell
me
so
i
would
not
compromise
my
dignity
by
a
useless
question
he
went
after
a
five
minutes
stay
and
i
was
about
to
turn
my
attention
to
household
affairs
when
franklin
came
in
his
sisters
jumped
like
puppets
to
meet
him
o
they
cried
for
once
thinking
and
speaking
alike
have
you
found
her
his
silence
was
so
eloquent
that
he
did
not
need
to
shake
his
head
but
you
will
before
the
day
is
out
protested
caroline
it
is
too
early
yet
added
isabella
i
never
thought
i
would
be
glad
to
see
that
woman
under
any
circumstances
continued
the
former
but
i
believe
now
that
if
i
saw
her
coming
up
the
street
on
howard
arm
i
should
be
happy
enough
to
rush
out
and
and
give
her
a
hug
finished
the
more
impetuous
isabella
it
was
not
what
caroline
meant
to
say
but
she
accepted
the
emendation
with
just
the
slightest
air
of
deprecation
they
were
both
evidently
much
attached
to
howard
and
ready
in
his
trouble
to
forget
and
forgive
everything
i
began
to
like
them
again
have
you
read
the
horrid
papers
and
how
is
papa
this
morning
and
what
shall
we
do
to
save
howard
now
flew
in
rapid
questions
from
their
lips
and
feeling
that
it
was
but
natural
they
should
have
their
little
say
i
sat
down
in
my
most
uncomfortable
chair
and
waited
for
these
first
ebullitions
to
exhaust
themselves
instantly
van
burnam
took
them
by
the
arm
and
led
them
away
to
a
distant
sofa
are
you
happy
here
he
asked
in
what
he
meant
for
a
very
confidential
tone
but
i
can
hear
as
readily
as
a
deaf
person
anything
which
is
not
meant
for
my
ears
o
she
kind
enough
whispered
caroline
but
so
stingy
do
take
us
where
we
can
get
something
to
eat
she
puts
all
her
money
into
china
such
plates
so
little
on
them
at
these
expressions
uttered
with
all
the
emphasis
a
whisper
will
allow
i
just
hugged
myself
in
my
quiet
corner
the
dear
giddy
things
but
they
should
see
they
should
see
i
fear
it
was
van
burnam
who
now
spoke
i
shall
have
to
take
my
sisters
from
under
your
kind
care
their
father
needs
them
and
has
i
believe
already
engaged
rooms
for
them
at
the
plaza
i
am
sorry
i
replied
but
surely
they
will
not
leave
till
they
have
had
another
meal
with
me
postpone
your
departure
young
ladies
till
after
luncheon
and
you
will
greatly
oblige
me
we
may
never
meet
so
agreeably
again
they
fidgeted
which
i
had
expected
and
cast
secret
looks
of
almost
comic
appeal
at
their
brother
but
he
pretended
not
to
see
them
being
disposed
for
some
reason
to
grant
my
request
taking
advantage
of
the
momentary
hesitation
that
ensued
i
made
them
all
three
my
most
conciliatory
bow
and
said
as
i
retreated
behind
the
portière
i
shall
give
my
orders
for
luncheon
now
meanwhile
i
hope
the
young
ladies
will
feel
perfectly
free
in
my
house
all
that
i
have
is
at
their
command
and
was
gone
before
they
could
protest
when
i
next
saw
them
they
were
upstairs
in
my
front
room
they
were
seated
together
in
the
window
and
looked
miserable
enough
to
have
a
little
diversion
going
to
my
closet
i
brought
out
a
it
contained
my
best
bonnet
young
ladies
what
do
you
think
of
this
i
inquired
taking
the
bonnet
out
and
carefully
placing
it
on
my
head
i
myself
consider
it
a
very
becoming
article
of
headgear
but
their
eyebrows
went
up
in
a
scarcely
complimentary
fashion
you
do
like
it
i
remarked
well
i
think
a
great
deal
of
young
girls
taste
i
shall
send
it
back
to
madame
more
i
do
think
much
of
madame
more
observed
isabella
and
after
paris
do
you
like
la
mole
better
i
inquired
bobbing
my
head
to
and
fro
before
the
mirror
the
better
to
conceal
my
interest
in
the
venture
i
was
making
i
do
like
any
of
them
but
returned
isabella
she
charges
twice
what
la
mole
does
twice
what
are
these
girls
purses
made
of
or
rather
their
father
but
she
has
the
we
are
accustomed
to
see
in
french
millinery
i
shall
go
anywhere
else
we
were
recommended
to
her
in
paris
put
in
caroline
more
languidly
her
interest
was
only
half
engaged
by
this
frivolous
topic
but
did
you
never
have
one
of
la
mole
hats
i
pursued
taking
down
a
ostensibly
to
get
the
effect
of
my
bonnet
in
the
back
but
really
to
hide
my
interest
in
their
unconscious
faces
never
retorted
isabella
i
would
not
patronize
the
thing
nor
you
i
urged
carelessly
turning
towards
caroline
no
i
have
never
been
inside
her
shop
then
whose
is
i
began
and
stopped
a
detective
doing
the
work
i
was
would
not
give
away
the
object
of
his
questions
so
recklessly
then
who
is
i
corrected
the
best
person
after
i
never
can
pay
prices
i
should
think
it
wicked
o
do
ask
us
protested
isabella
we
have
never
made
a
study
of
the
best
at
present
we
wear
hats
and
having
thus
thrown
their
youth
in
my
face
they
turned
away
to
the
window
again
not
realizing
that
the
lady
they
regarded
with
such
disdain
had
just
succeeded
in
making
them
dance
to
her
music
most
successfully
the
luncheon
i
ordered
was
elaborate
for
i
was
determined
that
the
misses
van
burnam
should
see
that
i
knew
how
to
serve
a
fine
meal
and
that
my
plates
were
not
always
better
than
my
viands
i
had
invited
in
a
couple
of
other
guests
so
that
i
should
not
seem
to
have
put
myself
out
for
two
young
girls
and
as
they
were
quiet
people
like
myself
the
meal
passed
most
decorously
when
it
was
finished
the
misses
caroline
and
isabella
had
lost
some
of
their
consequential
airs
and
i
really
think
the
deference
they
have
since
showed
me
is
due
more
to
the
surprise
they
felt
at
the
perfection
of
this
dainty
luncheon
than
to
any
considerate
appreciation
of
my
character
and
abilities
they
left
at
three
still
without
news
of
van
burnam
and
being
positive
by
this
time
that
the
shadows
were
thickening
about
this
family
i
saw
them
depart
with
some
regret
and
a
positive
feeling
of
commiseration
had
they
been
reared
to
a
proper
reverence
for
their
elders
how
much
more
easy
it
would
have
been
to
see
earnestness
in
caroline
and
affectionate
impulses
in
isabella
the
evening
papers
added
but
little
to
my
knowledge
great
disclosures
were
promised
but
no
hint
given
of
their
nature
the
body
at
the
morgue
had
not
been
identified
by
any
of
the
hundreds
who
had
viewed
it
and
howard
still
refused
to
acknowledge
it
as
that
of
his
wife
the
morrow
was
awaited
with
anxiety
so
much
for
the
public
press
at
twelve
at
night
i
was
again
seated
in
my
window
the
house
next
door
had
been
lighted
since
ten
and
i
was
in
momentary
expectation
of
its
nocturnal
visitor
he
came
promptly
at
the
hour
set
alighted
from
the
carriage
with
a
bound
shut
the
with
a
slam
and
crossed
the
pavement
with
cheerful
celerity
his
figure
was
not
so
positively
like
nor
yet
so
positively
unlike
that
of
the
supposed
murderer
that
i
could
definitely
say
this
is
he
or
this
is
not
he
and
i
went
to
bed
puzzled
and
not
a
little
burdened
by
a
sense
of
the
responsibility
imposed
upon
me
in
this
matter
and
so
passed
the
day
between
the
murder
and
the
inquest
ix
developments
gryce
called
about
nine
next
morning
well
said
he
what
about
the
visitor
who
came
to
see
me
last
night
like
and
unlike
i
answered
nothing
could
induce
me
to
say
he
is
the
man
we
want
and
yet
i
would
not
dare
to
swear
he
was
not
you
are
in
doubt
then
concerning
him
i
am
gryce
bowed
reminded
me
of
the
inquest
and
left
nothing
was
said
about
the
hat
at
ten
i
prepared
to
go
to
the
place
designated
by
him
i
had
never
attended
an
inquest
in
my
life
and
felt
a
little
flurried
in
consequence
but
by
the
time
i
had
tied
the
strings
of
my
bonnet
the
despised
bonnet
which
by
the
way
i
did
not
return
to
more
i
had
conquered
this
weakness
and
acquired
a
demeanor
more
in
keeping
with
my
very
important
position
as
chief
witness
in
a
serious
police
investigation
i
had
sent
for
a
carriage
to
take
me
and
i
rode
away
from
my
house
amid
the
shouts
of
some
half
dozen
boys
collected
on
the
but
i
did
not
allow
myself
to
feel
dashed
by
this
publicity
on
the
contrary
i
held
my
head
as
erect
as
nature
intended
and
my
back
kept
the
line
my
good
health
warrants
the
path
of
duty
has
its
thorny
passages
but
it
is
for
strong
minds
like
mine
to
ignore
them
promptly
at
ten
i
entered
the
room
reserved
for
the
inquest
and
was
ushered
to
the
seat
appointed
me
though
never
a
woman
i
could
not
but
be
aware
of
the
many
eyes
that
followed
me
and
endeavored
so
to
demean
myself
that
there
should
be
no
question
as
to
my
respectable
standing
in
the
community
this
i
considered
due
to
the
memory
of
my
father
who
was
very
much
in
my
thoughts
that
day
the
coroner
was
already
in
his
seat
when
i
entered
and
though
i
did
not
perceive
the
good
face
of
gryce
anywhere
in
his
vicinity
i
had
no
doubt
he
was
within
of
the
other
people
i
took
small
note
save
of
the
honest
of
whose
red
face
and
anxious
eyes
under
a
preposterous
bonnet
which
did
from
la
mole
i
caught
vague
glimpses
as
the
crowd
between
us
surged
to
and
fro
none
of
the
van
burnams
were
visible
but
this
did
not
necessarily
mean
that
they
were
absent
indeed
i
was
very
sure
from
certain
indications
that
more
than
one
member
of
the
family
could
be
seen
in
the
small
room
connecting
with
the
large
one
in
which
we
witnesses
sat
with
the
jury
the
policeman
carroll
was
the
first
man
to
talk
he
told
of
my
stopping
him
on
his
beat
and
of
his
entrance
into
van
burnam
house
with
the
he
gave
the
details
of
his
discovery
of
the
dead
woman
body
on
the
parlor
floor
and
insisted
that
no
one
here
he
looked
very
hard
at
me
had
been
allowed
to
touch
the
body
till
relief
had
come
to
him
from
headquarters
boppert
the
followed
him
and
if
she
was
watched
by
no
one
else
in
that
room
she
was
watched
by
me
her
manner
before
the
coroner
was
no
more
satisfactory
according
to
my
notion
than
it
had
been
in
van
burnam
parlor
she
gave
a
very
perceptible
start
when
they
spoke
her
name
and
looked
quite
scared
when
the
bible
was
held
out
towards
her
but
she
took
the
oath
notwithstanding
and
with
her
testimony
the
inquiry
began
in
earnest
what
is
your
name
asked
the
coroner
as
this
was
something
she
could
not
help
knowing
she
uttered
the
necessary
words
glibly
though
in
a
way
that
showed
she
resented
his
impertinence
in
asking
her
what
he
already
knew
where
do
you
live
and
what
do
you
do
for
a
living
rapidly
followed
she
replied
that
she
was
a
and
cleaned
people
houses
and
having
said
this
she
assumed
a
very
dogged
air
which
i
thought
strange
enough
to
raise
a
question
in
the
minds
of
those
who
watched
her
but
no
one
else
seemed
to
regard
it
as
anything
but
the
embarrassment
of
ignorance
how
long
have
you
known
the
van
burnam
family
the
coroner
went
on
two
years
sir
come
next
christmas
have
you
often
done
work
for
them
i
clean
the
house
twice
a
year
fall
and
spring
why
were
you
at
this
house
two
days
ago
to
scrub
the
kitchen
floors
sir
and
put
the
pantries
in
order
had
you
received
notice
to
do
so
yes
sir
through
franklin
van
burnam
and
was
that
the
first
day
of
your
work
there
no
sir
i
had
been
there
all
the
day
before
you
do
speak
loud
enough
objected
the
coroner
remember
that
every
one
in
this
room
wants
to
hear
you
she
looked
up
and
with
a
frightened
air
surveyed
the
crowd
about
her
publicity
evidently
made
her
most
uncomfortable
and
her
voice
sank
rather
than
rose
where
did
you
get
the
key
of
the
house
and
by
what
door
did
you
enter
i
went
in
at
the
basement
sir
and
i
got
the
key
at
van
agent
in
dey
street
i
had
to
go
for
it
sometimes
they
send
it
to
me
but
not
this
time
and
now
relate
your
meeting
with
the
policeman
on
wednesday
morning
in
front
of
van
burnam
house
she
tried
to
tell
her
story
but
she
made
awkward
work
of
it
and
they
had
to
ply
her
with
questions
to
get
at
the
smallest
fact
but
finally
she
managed
to
repeat
what
we
already
knew
how
she
went
with
the
policeman
into
the
house
and
how
they
stumbled
upon
the
dead
woman
in
the
parlor
further
than
this
they
did
not
question
her
and
i
amelia
butterworth
had
to
sit
in
silence
and
see
her
go
back
to
her
seat
redder
than
before
but
with
a
strangely
satisfied
air
that
told
me
she
had
escaped
more
easily
than
she
had
expected
and
yet
gryce
had
been
warned
that
she
knew
more
than
appeared
and
by
one
in
whom
he
seemed
to
have
placed
some
confidence
the
doctor
was
called
next
his
testimony
was
most
important
and
contained
a
surprise
for
me
and
more
than
one
surprise
for
the
others
after
a
short
preliminary
examination
he
was
requested
to
state
how
long
the
woman
had
been
dead
when
he
was
called
in
to
examine
her
more
than
twelve
and
less
than
eighteen
hours
was
his
quiet
reply
had
the
rigor
mortis
set
in
no
but
it
began
very
soon
after
did
you
examine
the
wounds
made
by
the
falling
shelves
and
the
vases
that
tumbled
with
them
i
did
will
you
describe
them
he
did
so
and
now
there
was
a
pause
in
the
coroner
question
which
roused
us
all
to
its
importance
which
of
these
many
serious
wounds
was
in
your
opinion
the
cause
of
her
death
the
witness
was
accustomed
to
such
scenes
and
was
perfectly
at
home
in
them
surveying
the
coroner
with
a
respectful
air
he
turned
slowly
towards
the
jury
and
answered
in
a
slow
and
impressive
manner
i
feel
ready
to
declare
sirs
that
none
of
them
did
she
was
not
killed
by
the
falling
of
the
cabinet
upon
her
not
killed
by
the
falling
shelves
why
not
were
they
not
sufficiently
heavy
or
did
they
not
strike
her
in
a
vital
place
they
were
heavy
enough
and
they
struck
her
in
a
way
to
kill
her
if
she
had
not
been
already
dead
when
they
fell
upon
her
as
it
was
they
simply
bruised
a
body
from
which
life
had
already
departed
as
this
was
putting
it
very
plainly
many
of
the
crowd
who
had
not
been
acquainted
with
these
facts
previously
showed
their
interest
in
a
very
unmistakable
manner
but
the
coroner
ignoring
these
symptoms
of
growing
excitement
hastened
to
say
this
is
a
very
serious
statement
you
are
making
doctor
if
she
did
not
die
from
the
wounds
inflicted
by
the
objects
which
fell
upon
her
from
what
cause
did
she
die
can
you
say
that
her
death
was
a
natural
one
and
that
the
falling
of
the
shelves
was
merely
an
unhappy
accident
following
it
no
sir
her
death
was
not
natural
she
was
killed
but
not
by
the
falling
cabinet
killed
and
not
by
the
cabinet
how
then
was
there
any
other
wound
upon
her
which
you
regard
as
mortal
yes
sir
suspecting
that
she
had
perished
from
other
means
than
appeared
i
made
a
most
rigid
examination
of
her
body
when
i
discovered
under
the
hair
in
the
nape
of
the
neck
a
minute
spot
which
upon
probing
i
found
to
be
the
end
of
a
small
thin
point
of
steel
it
had
been
thrust
by
a
careful
hand
into
the
most
vulnerable
part
of
the
body
and
death
must
have
ensued
at
once
this
was
too
much
for
certain
excitable
persons
present
and
a
momentary
disturbance
arose
which
however
was
nothing
to
that
in
my
own
breast
so
so
it
was
her
neck
that
had
been
pierced
and
not
her
heart
gryce
had
allowed
us
to
think
it
was
the
latter
but
it
was
not
this
fact
which
stupefied
me
but
the
skill
and
diabolical
coolness
of
the
man
who
had
inflicted
this
after
order
had
been
restored
which
i
will
say
was
very
soon
the
coroner
with
an
added
gravity
of
tone
went
on
with
his
questions
did
you
recognize
this
bit
of
steel
as
belonging
to
any
instrument
in
the
medical
profession
no
it
was
of
too
untempered
steel
to
have
been
manufactured
for
any
thrusting
or
cutting
purposes
it
was
of
the
commonest
kind
and
had
broken
short
off
in
the
wound
it
was
the
end
only
that
i
found
have
you
this
end
with
you
the
point
i
mean
which
you
found
imbedded
at
the
base
of
the
dead
woman
brain
i
have
sir
and
he
handed
it
over
to
the
jury
as
they
passed
it
along
the
coroner
remarked
later
we
will
show
you
the
remaining
portion
of
this
instrument
of
death
which
did
not
tend
to
allay
the
general
excitement
seeing
this
the
coroner
humored
the
growing
interest
by
pushing
on
his
inquiries
doctor
he
asked
are
you
prepared
to
say
how
long
a
time
elapsed
between
the
infliction
of
this
fatal
wound
and
those
which
disfigured
her
no
sir
not
exactly
but
some
little
time
some
little
time
when
the
murderer
was
in
the
house
only
ten
minutes
all
looked
their
surprise
and
as
if
the
coroner
had
divined
this
feeling
of
general
curiosity
he
leaned
forward
and
emphatically
repeated
more
than
ten
minutes
the
doctor
who
had
every
appearance
of
realizing
the
importance
of
his
reply
did
not
hesitate
evidently
his
mind
was
quite
made
up
more
than
ten
this
was
the
shock
received
from
his
testimony
i
remembered
what
the
clock
had
revealed
to
me
but
i
did
not
move
a
muscle
of
my
face
i
was
learning
under
these
repeated
surprises
this
is
an
unexpected
statement
remarked
the
coroner
what
reasons
have
you
to
urge
in
explanation
of
it
very
simple
and
very
well
known
ones
at
least
among
the
profession
there
was
too
little
blood
seen
for
the
wounds
to
have
been
inflicted
before
death
or
within
a
few
minutes
after
it
had
the
woman
been
living
when
they
were
made
or
even
had
she
been
but
a
short
time
dead
the
floor
would
have
been
deluged
with
the
blood
gushing
from
so
many
and
such
serious
injuries
but
the
effusion
was
slight
so
slight
that
i
noticed
it
at
once
and
came
to
the
conclusions
mentioned
before
i
found
the
mark
of
the
stab
that
occasioned
death
i
see
i
see
and
was
that
the
reason
you
called
in
two
neighboring
physicians
to
view
the
body
before
it
was
removed
from
the
house
yes
sir
in
so
important
a
matter
i
wished
to
have
my
judgment
confirmed
and
these
physicians
were
campbell
of
east
street
and
jacobs
of
lexington
avenue
are
these
gentlemen
here
inquired
the
coroner
of
an
officer
who
stood
near
they
are
sir
very
good
we
will
now
proceed
to
ask
one
or
two
more
questions
of
this
witness
you
told
us
that
even
had
the
woman
been
but
a
few
minutes
dead
when
she
received
these
contusions
the
floor
would
have
been
more
or
less
deluged
by
her
blood
what
reason
have
you
for
this
statement
this
that
in
a
few
minutes
let
us
say
ten
since
that
number
has
been
used
the
body
has
not
had
time
to
cool
nor
have
the
had
sufficient
opportunity
to
stiffen
so
as
to
prevent
the
free
effusion
of
blood
is
a
body
still
warm
at
ten
minutes
after
death
it
is
so
that
your
conclusions
are
logical
deductions
from
facts
certainly
sir
a
pause
of
some
duration
followed
when
the
coroner
again
proceeded
it
was
to
remark
the
case
is
complicated
by
these
discoveries
but
we
must
not
allow
ourselves
to
be
daunted
by
them
let
me
ask
you
if
you
found
any
marks
upon
this
body
which
might
aid
in
its
identification
one
a
slight
scar
on
the
left
ankle
what
kind
of
a
scar
describe
it
it
was
such
as
a
burn
might
leave
in
shape
it
was
long
and
narrow
and
it
ran
up
the
limb
from
the
was
it
on
the
right
foot
no
on
the
left
did
you
call
the
attention
of
any
one
to
this
mark
during
or
after
your
examination
yes
i
showed
it
to
gryce
the
detective
and
to
my
two
coadjutors
and
i
spoke
of
it
to
howard
van
burnam
son
of
the
gentleman
in
whose
house
the
body
was
found
it
was
the
first
time
this
young
gentleman
name
had
been
mentioned
and
it
made
my
blood
run
cold
to
see
how
many
looks
and
expressive
shrugs
it
caused
in
the
motley
assemblage
but
i
had
no
time
for
sentiment
the
inquiry
was
growing
too
interesting
and
why
asked
the
coroner
did
you
mention
it
to
this
young
man
in
preference
to
others
because
gryce
requested
me
to
because
the
family
as
well
as
the
young
man
himself
had
evinced
some
apprehension
lest
the
deceased
might
prove
to
be
his
missing
wife
and
this
seemed
a
likely
way
to
settle
the
question
and
did
it
did
he
acknowledge
it
to
be
a
mark
he
remembered
to
have
seen
on
his
wife
he
said
she
had
such
a
scar
but
he
would
not
acknowledge
the
deceased
to
be
his
wife
did
he
see
the
scar
no
he
would
not
look
at
it
did
you
invite
him
to
i
did
but
he
showed
no
curiosity
doubtless
thinking
that
silence
would
best
emphasize
this
fact
which
certainly
was
an
astonishing
one
the
coroner
waited
a
minute
but
there
was
no
silence
an
indescribable
murmur
from
a
great
many
lips
filled
up
the
gap
i
felt
a
movement
of
pity
for
the
proud
family
whose
good
name
was
thus
threatened
in
the
person
of
this
young
gentleman
doctor
continued
the
coroner
as
soon
as
the
murmur
had
subsided
did
you
notice
the
color
of
the
woman
hair
it
was
a
light
brown
did
you
sever
a
lock
have
you
a
sample
of
this
hair
here
to
show
us
i
have
sir
at
gryce
suggestion
i
cut
off
two
small
locks
one
i
gave
him
and
the
other
i
brought
here
let
me
see
it
the
doctor
passed
it
up
and
in
sight
of
every
one
present
the
coroner
tied
a
string
around
it
and
attached
a
ticket
to
it
that
is
to
prevent
all
mistake
explained
this
very
methodical
functionary
laying
the
lock
aside
on
the
table
in
front
of
him
then
he
turned
again
to
the
witness
doctor
we
are
indebted
to
you
for
your
valuable
testimony
and
as
you
are
a
busy
man
we
will
now
excuse
you
let
jacobs
be
called
as
this
gentleman
as
well
as
the
witness
who
followed
him
merely
corroborated
the
statements
of
the
other
and
made
it
an
accepted
fact
that
the
shelves
had
fallen
upon
the
body
of
the
girl
some
time
after
the
first
wound
had
been
inflicted
i
will
not
attempt
to
repeat
their
testimony
the
question
now
agitating
me
was
whether
they
would
endeavor
to
fix
the
time
at
which
the
shelves
fell
by
the
evidence
furnished
by
the
clock
x
important
evidence
evidently
not
for
the
next
words
i
heard
were
miss
amelia
butterworth
i
had
not
expected
to
be
called
so
soon
and
was
somewhat
flustered
by
the
suddenness
of
the
summons
for
i
am
only
human
but
i
rose
with
suitable
composure
and
passed
to
the
place
indicated
by
the
coroner
in
my
usual
straightforward
manner
heightened
only
by
a
sense
of
the
importance
of
my
position
both
as
a
witness
and
a
woman
whom
the
once
famous
gryce
had
taken
more
or
less
into
his
confidence
my
appearance
seemed
to
awaken
an
interest
for
which
i
was
not
prepared
i
was
just
thinking
how
well
my
name
had
sounded
uttered
in
the
sonorous
tones
of
the
coroner
and
how
grateful
i
ought
to
be
for
the
courage
i
had
displayed
in
substituting
the
genteel
name
of
amelia
for
the
weak
and
sentimental
one
of
araminta
when
i
became
conscious
that
the
eyes
directed
towards
me
were
filled
with
an
expression
not
easy
to
understand
i
should
not
like
to
call
it
admiration
and
will
not
call
it
amusement
and
yet
it
seemed
to
be
made
up
of
both
while
i
was
puzzling
myself
over
it
the
first
question
came
as
my
examination
before
the
coroner
only
brought
out
the
facts
already
related
i
will
not
burden
you
with
a
detailed
account
of
it
one
portion
alone
may
be
of
interest
i
was
being
questioned
in
regard
to
the
appearance
of
the
couple
i
had
seen
entering
the
van
burnam
mansion
when
the
coroner
asked
if
the
young
woman
step
was
light
or
if
it
betrayed
hesitation
i
replied
no
hesitation
she
moved
quickly
almost
gaily
and
he
was
more
moderate
but
there
is
no
signification
in
that
he
may
have
been
older
no
theories
miss
butterworth
it
is
facts
we
are
after
now
do
you
know
that
he
was
older
no
sir
did
you
get
any
idea
as
to
his
age
the
impression
he
made
was
that
of
being
a
young
man
and
his
height
was
medium
and
his
figure
slight
and
elegant
he
moved
as
a
gentleman
moves
of
this
i
can
speak
with
great
positiveness
do
you
think
you
could
identify
him
miss
butterworth
if
you
should
see
him
i
hesitated
as
i
perceived
that
the
whole
swaying
mass
eagerly
awaited
my
reply
i
even
turned
my
head
because
i
saw
others
doing
so
but
i
regretted
this
when
i
found
that
i
as
well
as
others
was
glancing
towards
the
door
beyond
which
the
van
burnams
were
supposed
to
sit
to
cover
up
the
false
move
i
had
made
for
i
had
no
wish
as
yet
to
centre
suspicion
upon
anybody
i
turned
my
face
quickly
back
to
the
crowd
and
declared
in
as
emphatic
a
tone
as
i
could
command
i
have
thought
i
could
do
so
if
i
saw
him
under
the
same
circumstances
as
those
in
which
my
first
impression
was
made
but
lately
i
have
begun
to
doubt
even
that
i
should
never
dare
trust
to
my
memory
in
this
regard
the
coroner
looked
disappointed
and
so
did
the
people
around
me
it
is
a
pity
remarked
the
coroner
that
you
did
not
see
more
plainly
and
now
how
did
these
persons
gain
an
entrance
into
the
house
i
answered
in
the
most
succinct
way
possible
i
told
them
how
he
had
used
a
in
entering
of
the
length
of
time
the
man
stayed
inside
and
of
his
appearance
on
going
away
i
also
related
how
i
came
to
call
a
policeman
to
investigate
the
matter
next
day
and
corroborated
the
statements
of
this
official
as
to
the
appearance
of
the
deceased
at
time
of
discovery
and
there
my
examination
stopped
i
was
not
asked
any
questions
tending
to
bring
out
the
cause
of
the
suspicion
i
entertained
against
the
nor
were
the
discoveries
i
had
made
in
conjunction
with
gryce
inquired
into
it
was
just
as
well
perhaps
but
i
would
never
approve
of
a
piece
of
work
done
for
me
in
this
slipshod
fashion
a
recess
now
followed
why
it
was
thought
necessary
i
can
not
imagine
unless
the
gentlemen
wished
to
smoke
had
they
felt
as
much
interest
in
this
murder
as
i
did
they
would
not
have
wanted
bite
or
sup
till
the
dreadful
question
was
settled
there
being
a
recess
i
improved
the
opportunity
by
going
into
a
restaurant
near
by
where
one
can
get
very
good
buns
and
coffee
at
a
reasonable
price
but
i
could
have
done
without
them
the
next
witness
to
my
astonishment
was
gryce
as
he
stepped
forward
heads
were
craned
and
many
women
rose
in
their
seats
to
get
a
glimpse
of
the
noted
detective
i
showed
no
curiosity
myself
for
by
this
time
i
knew
his
features
well
but
i
did
feel
a
great
satisfaction
in
seeing
him
before
the
coroner
for
now
thought
i
we
shall
hear
something
worth
our
attention
but
his
examination
though
interesting
was
not
complete
the
coroner
remembering
his
promise
to
show
us
the
other
end
of
the
steel
point
which
had
been
broken
off
in
the
dead
girl
brain
limited
himself
to
such
inquiries
as
brought
out
the
discovery
of
the
broken
in
van
burnam
parlor
register
no
mention
was
made
by
the
witness
of
any
assistance
which
he
may
have
received
in
making
this
discovery
a
fact
which
caused
me
to
smile
men
are
so
jealous
of
any
interference
in
their
affairs
the
end
found
in
the
register
and
the
end
which
the
coroner
physician
had
drawn
from
the
poor
woman
head
were
both
handed
to
the
jury
and
it
was
interesting
to
note
how
each
man
made
his
little
effort
to
fit
the
two
ends
together
and
the
looks
they
interchanged
as
they
found
themselves
successful
without
doubt
and
in
the
eyes
of
all
the
instrument
of
death
had
been
found
but
what
an
instrument
the
felt
hat
which
had
been
discovered
under
the
body
was
now
produced
and
the
one
hole
made
by
a
similar
pin
examined
then
gryce
was
asked
if
any
other
pin
had
been
picked
up
from
the
floor
of
the
room
and
he
replied
no
and
the
fact
was
established
in
the
minds
of
all
present
that
the
young
woman
had
been
killed
by
a
pin
taken
from
her
own
hat
a
subtle
and
cruel
crime
the
work
of
a
calculating
intellect
was
the
coroner
comment
as
he
allowed
the
detective
to
sit
down
which
expression
of
opinion
i
thought
reprehensible
as
tending
to
prejudice
the
jury
against
the
only
person
at
present
suspected
the
inquiry
now
took
a
turn
the
name
of
miss
ferguson
was
called
who
was
miss
ferguson
it
was
a
new
name
to
most
of
us
and
her
face
when
she
rose
only
added
to
the
general
curiosity
it
was
the
plainest
face
imaginable
yet
it
was
neither
a
bad
nor
unintelligent
one
as
i
studied
it
and
noted
the
nervous
contraction
that
disfigured
her
lip
i
could
not
but
be
sensible
of
my
blessings
i
am
not
handsome
myself
though
there
have
been
persons
who
have
called
me
so
but
neither
am
i
ugly
and
in
contrast
to
this
woman
well
i
will
say
nothing
i
only
know
that
after
seeing
her
i
felt
profoundly
grateful
to
a
kind
providence
as
for
the
poor
woman
herself
she
knew
she
was
no
beauty
but
she
had
become
so
accustomed
to
seeing
the
eyes
of
other
people
turn
away
from
her
face
that
beyond
the
nervous
twitching
of
which
i
have
spoken
she
showed
no
feeling
what
is
your
full
name
and
where
do
you
live
asked
the
coroner
my
name
is
susan
ferguson
and
i
live
in
haddam
connecticut
was
her
reply
uttered
in
such
soft
and
beautiful
tones
that
every
one
was
astonished
it
was
like
a
stream
of
limpid
water
flowing
from
a
most
rock
excuse
the
metaphor
i
do
not
often
indulge
do
you
keep
boarders
i
do
a
few
sir
such
as
my
house
will
accommodate
whom
have
you
had
with
you
this
summer
i
knew
what
her
answer
would
be
before
she
uttered
it
so
did
a
hundred
others
but
they
showed
their
knowledge
in
different
ways
i
did
not
show
mine
at
all
i
have
had
with
me
said
she
a
and
van
burnam
from
new
york
howard
van
burnam
is
his
full
name
if
you
wish
me
to
be
explicit
any
one
else
a
mr
hull
also
from
new
york
and
a
young
couple
from
hartford
my
house
accommodates
no
more
how
long
have
the
first
mentioned
couple
been
with
you
three
months
they
came
in
june
are
they
with
you
still
virtually
sir
they
have
not
moved
their
trunks
but
neither
of
them
is
in
haddam
at
present
van
burnam
came
to
new
york
last
monday
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
her
husband
also
left
presumably
for
new
york
i
have
seen
nothing
of
either
of
them
since
it
was
on
tuesday
night
the
murder
occurred
did
either
of
them
take
a
trunk
no
sir
a
yes
van
burnam
carried
a
bag
but
it
was
a
very
small
one
large
enough
to
hold
a
dress
o
no
sir
and
van
burnam
he
carried
an
umbrella
i
saw
nothing
else
why
did
they
not
leave
together
did
you
hear
any
one
say
yes
i
heard
them
say
van
burnam
came
against
her
wishes
he
did
not
want
her
to
leave
haddam
but
she
would
and
he
was
none
too
pleased
at
it
indeed
they
had
words
about
it
and
as
both
our
rooms
overlook
the
same
veranda
i
could
not
help
hearing
some
of
their
talk
will
you
tell
us
what
you
heard
it
does
not
seem
right
thus
this
honest
woman
spoke
but
if
the
law
i
must
not
go
against
it
i
heard
him
say
these
words
have
changed
my
mind
louise
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
disinclined
i
am
to
have
you
meddle
in
the
matter
besides
it
will
do
no
good
you
will
only
add
to
the
prejudice
against
you
and
our
life
will
become
more
unbearable
than
it
is
now
of
what
were
they
speaking
i
do
not
know
and
what
did
she
reply
o
she
uttered
a
torrent
of
words
that
had
less
sense
in
them
than
feeling
she
wanted
to
go
she
would
go
had
not
changed
mind
and
considered
that
her
impulses
were
as
well
worth
following
as
his
cool
judgment
she
was
not
happy
had
never
been
happy
and
meant
there
should
be
a
change
even
if
it
were
for
the
worse
but
she
did
not
believe
it
would
be
for
the
worse
was
she
not
pretty
was
she
not
very
pretty
when
in
distress
and
looking
up
thus
and
i
heard
her
fall
on
her
knees
a
movement
which
called
out
a
grunt
from
her
husband
but
whether
this
was
an
expression
of
approval
or
disapproval
i
can
not
say
a
silence
followed
during
which
i
caught
the
sound
of
his
steady
tramping
up
and
down
the
room
then
she
spoke
again
in
a
petulant
way
may
seem
foolish
to
she
cried
me
as
you
do
and
being
used
to
seeing
me
in
all
my
moods
but
to
him
it
will
be
a
surprise
and
i
will
so
manage
it
that
it
will
effect
all
we
want
and
more
too
perhaps
i
i
have
a
genius
for
some
things
howard
and
my
better
angel
tells
me
i
shall
succeed
and
what
did
he
reply
to
that
that
the
name
of
her
better
angel
was
vanity
that
his
father
would
see
through
her
blandishments
that
he
forbade
her
to
prosecute
her
schemes
and
much
more
to
the
same
effect
to
all
of
which
she
answered
by
a
vigorous
stamp
of
her
foot
and
the
declaration
that
she
was
going
to
do
what
she
thought
best
in
spite
of
all
opposition
that
it
was
a
lover
and
not
a
tyrant
that
she
had
married
and
that
if
he
did
not
know
what
was
good
for
himself
she
did
and
that
when
he
received
an
intimation
from
his
father
that
the
breach
in
the
family
was
closed
then
he
would
acknowledge
that
if
she
had
no
fortune
and
no
connections
she
had
at
least
a
plentiful
supply
of
wit
upon
which
he
remarked
poor
qualification
when
it
verges
upon
folly
which
seemed
to
close
the
conversation
for
i
heard
no
more
till
the
sound
of
her
skirts
rustling
past
my
door
assured
me
she
had
carried
her
point
and
was
leaving
the
house
but
this
was
not
done
without
great
discomfiture
to
her
husband
if
one
may
judge
from
the
few
brief
but
emphatic
words
that
escaped
him
before
he
closed
his
own
door
and
followed
her
down
the
hall
do
you
remember
those
words
they
were
swear
words
sir
i
am
sorry
to
say
it
but
he
certainly
cursed
her
and
his
own
folly
yet
i
always
thought
he
loved
her
did
you
see
her
after
she
passed
your
door
yes
sir
on
the
walk
outside
was
she
then
on
the
way
to
the
train
yes
sir
carrying
the
bag
of
which
you
have
spoken
yes
sir
another
proof
of
the
state
of
feeling
between
them
for
he
was
very
considerate
in
his
treatment
of
ladies
and
i
never
saw
him
do
anything
ungallant
before
you
say
you
watched
her
as
she
went
down
the
walk
yes
sir
it
is
human
nature
sir
i
have
no
other
excuse
to
offer
it
was
an
apology
i
myself
might
have
made
i
conceived
a
liking
for
this
homely
woman
did
you
note
her
dress
yes
sir
that
is
human
nature
also
or
rather
woman
nature
particularly
madam
so
that
you
can
describe
it
to
the
jury
before
you
i
think
so
will
you
then
be
good
enough
to
tell
us
what
sort
of
a
dress
van
burnam
wore
when
she
left
your
house
for
the
city
it
was
a
black
and
white
plaid
silk
very
rich
why
what
did
this
mean
we
had
all
expected
a
very
different
description
it
was
made
fashionably
and
the
sleeves
well
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
sleeves
she
wore
no
wrap
which
seemed
foolish
to
me
for
we
have
very
sudden
changes
sometimes
in
september
a
plaid
dress
and
did
you
notice
her
hat
o
i
have
seen
the
hat
often
it
was
of
every
conceivable
color
it
would
have
been
called
bad
taste
at
one
time
but
the
pause
was
significant
more
than
one
man
in
the
room
chuckled
but
the
women
kept
a
discreet
silence
would
you
know
that
hat
if
you
saw
it
i
should
think
i
would
the
emphasis
was
that
of
a
countrywoman
and
amused
some
people
notwithstanding
the
melodious
tone
in
which
it
was
uttered
but
it
did
not
amuse
me
my
thoughts
had
flown
to
the
hat
which
gryce
had
found
in
the
third
room
of
van
burnam
house
and
which
was
of
every
color
of
the
rainbow
the
coroner
asked
two
other
questions
one
in
regard
to
the
gloves
worn
by
van
burnam
and
the
other
in
regard
to
her
shoes
to
the
first
miss
ferguson
replied
that
she
did
not
notice
her
gloves
and
to
the
other
that
van
burnam
was
very
fashionable
and
as
pointed
shoes
were
the
fashion
in
cities
at
least
she
probably
wore
pointed
shoes
the
discovery
that
van
burnam
had
been
differently
dressed
on
that
day
from
the
young
woman
found
dead
in
the
van
burnam
parlors
had
acted
as
a
shock
upon
most
of
the
spectators
they
were
just
beginning
to
recover
from
it
when
miss
ferguson
sat
down
the
coroner
was
the
only
one
who
had
not
seemed
at
a
loss
why
we
were
soon
destined
to
know
xi
the
order
clerk
a
lady
well
known
in
new
york
society
was
the
next
person
summoned
she
was
a
friend
of
the
van
burnam
family
and
had
known
howard
from
childhood
she
had
not
liked
his
marriage
indeed
she
rather
participated
in
the
family
feeling
against
it
but
when
young
van
burnam
came
to
her
house
on
the
preceding
monday
and
begged
the
privilege
of
remaining
with
her
for
one
night
she
had
not
had
the
heart
to
refuse
her
van
burnam
had
therefore
slept
in
her
house
on
monday
night
questioned
in
regard
to
that
lady
appearance
and
manner
she
answered
that
her
guest
was
unnaturally
cheerful
laughing
much
and
showing
a
great
vivacity
that
she
gave
no
reason
for
her
good
spirits
nor
did
she
mention
her
own
affairs
in
any
way
rather
took
pains
not
to
do
so
how
long
did
she
stay
till
the
next
morning
and
how
was
she
dressed
just
as
miss
ferguson
has
described
did
she
bring
her
to
your
house
yes
and
left
it
there
we
found
it
in
her
room
after
she
was
gone
indeed
and
how
do
you
account
for
that
she
was
preoccupied
i
saw
it
in
her
cheerfulness
which
was
forced
and
not
always
well
timed
and
where
is
that
bag
now
van
burnam
has
it
we
kept
it
for
a
day
and
as
she
did
not
call
for
it
sent
it
down
to
the
office
on
wednesday
morning
before
you
had
heard
of
the
murder
o
yes
before
i
had
heard
anything
about
the
murder
as
she
was
your
guest
you
probably
accompanied
her
to
the
door
i
did
sir
did
you
notice
her
hands
can
you
say
what
was
the
color
of
her
gloves
i
do
not
think
she
wore
any
gloves
on
leaving
it
was
very
warm
and
she
held
them
in
her
hand
i
remembered
this
for
i
noticed
the
sparkle
of
her
rings
as
she
turned
to
say
ah
you
saw
her
rings
distinctly
so
that
when
she
left
you
she
was
dressed
in
a
black
and
white
plaid
silk
had
a
large
hat
covered
with
flowers
on
her
head
and
wore
rings
yes
sir
and
with
these
words
ringing
in
the
ears
of
the
jury
the
witness
sat
down
what
was
coming
something
important
or
the
coroner
would
not
look
so
satisfied
or
the
faces
of
the
officials
about
him
so
expectant
i
waited
with
great
but
subdued
eagerness
for
the
testimony
of
the
next
witness
who
was
a
young
man
by
the
name
of
callahan
i
do
like
young
men
in
general
they
are
either
and
polite
as
if
they
condescended
to
remember
that
you
are
elderly
and
that
it
is
their
duty
to
make
you
forget
it
or
else
they
are
pert
and
shallow
and
disgust
you
with
their
egotism
but
this
young
man
looked
sensible
and
and
i
took
to
him
at
once
though
what
connection
he
could
have
with
this
affair
i
could
not
imagine
his
first
words
however
settled
all
questions
as
to
his
personality
he
was
the
order
clerk
at
altman
as
he
acknowledged
this
i
seemed
to
have
some
faint
premonition
of
what
was
coming
perhaps
i
had
not
been
without
some
vague
idea
of
the
truth
ever
since
i
had
put
my
mind
to
work
on
this
matter
perhaps
my
wits
only
received
their
real
spur
then
but
certainly
i
knew
what
he
was
going
to
say
as
soon
as
he
opened
his
lips
which
gave
me
quite
a
good
opinion
of
myself
whether
rightfully
or
not
i
leave
you
to
judge
his
evidence
was
short
but
very
much
to
the
point
on
the
seventeenth
of
september
as
could
be
verified
by
the
books
the
firm
had
received
an
order
for
a
woman
complete
outfit
to
be
sent
to
james
pope
at
the
hotel
d
on
broadway
sizes
and
measures
and
some
particulars
were
stated
and
as
the
order
bore
the
words
underlined
upon
it
several
clerks
had
assisted
him
in
filling
this
order
which
when
filled
had
been
sent
by
special
messenger
to
the
place
designated
had
he
this
order
with
him
he
had
and
could
he
identify
the
articles
sent
to
fill
it
he
could
at
which
the
coroner
motioned
to
an
officer
and
a
pile
of
clothing
was
brought
forward
from
some
mysterious
corner
and
laid
before
the
witness
immediately
expectation
rose
to
a
high
pitch
for
every
one
recognized
or
thought
he
did
the
apparel
which
had
been
taken
from
the
victim
the
young
man
who
was
of
the
alert
nervous
type
took
up
the
articles
one
by
one
and
examined
them
closely
as
he
did
so
the
whole
assembled
crowd
surged
forward
and
glances
from
a
hundred
eyes
followed
his
every
movement
and
expression
are
they
the
same
inquired
the
coroner
the
witness
did
not
hesitate
with
one
quick
glance
at
the
blue
serge
dress
black
cape
and
battered
hat
he
answered
in
a
firm
tone
they
are
and
a
clue
was
given
at
last
to
the
dreadful
mystery
absorbing
us
the
sigh
which
swept
through
the
room
testified
to
the
universal
satisfaction
then
our
attention
became
fixed
again
for
the
coroner
pointing
to
the
undergarments
accompanying
the
articles
already
mentioned
demanded
if
they
had
been
included
in
the
order
there
was
as
little
hesitation
in
the
reply
given
to
this
question
as
to
the
former
he
recognized
each
piece
as
having
come
from
his
establishment
you
will
note
said
he
that
they
have
never
been
washed
and
that
the
pencil
marks
are
still
on
them
very
good
observed
the
coroner
and
you
will
note
that
one
article
there
is
torn
down
the
back
was
it
in
that
condition
when
sent
it
was
not
sir
all
were
in
perfect
order
most
assuredly
sir
very
good
again
the
jury
will
take
cognizance
of
this
fact
which
may
be
useful
to
them
in
their
future
conclusions
and
now
callahan
do
you
notice
anything
lacking
here
from
the
list
of
articles
forwarded
by
you
no
sir
yet
there
is
one
very
necessary
adjunct
to
a
woman
outfit
which
is
not
to
be
found
here
yes
sir
the
shoes
but
i
am
not
surprised
at
that
we
sent
shoes
but
they
were
not
satisfactory
and
they
were
returned
ah
i
see
officer
show
the
witness
the
shoes
that
were
taken
from
the
deceased
this
was
done
and
when
callahan
had
examined
them
the
coroner
inquired
if
they
came
from
his
store
he
replied
no
whereupon
they
were
held
up
to
the
jury
and
attention
called
to
the
fact
that
while
rather
new
than
old
they
gave
signs
of
having
been
worn
more
than
once
which
was
not
true
of
anything
else
taken
from
the
victim
this
matter
settled
the
coroner
proceeded
with
his
questions
who
carried
the
articles
ordered
to
the
address
given
a
man
in
our
employ
named
clapp
did
he
bring
back
the
amount
of
the
bill
yes
sir
less
the
five
dollars
charged
for
the
shoes
what
was
the
amount
may
i
ask
here
is
our
sir
the
amount
received
from
james
pope
hotel
d
on
the
seventeenth
of
september
is
as
you
see
dollars
and
cents
let
the
jury
see
the
book
also
the
order
they
were
both
handed
to
the
jury
and
if
ever
i
wished
myself
in
any
one
shoes
save
my
own
very
substantial
ones
it
was
at
that
moment
i
did
so
want
a
peep
at
that
order
it
seemed
to
interest
the
jury
also
for
their
heads
drew
together
very
eagerly
over
it
and
some
whispers
and
a
few
knowing
looks
passed
between
them
finally
one
of
them
spoke
it
is
written
in
a
very
odd
hand
do
you
call
this
a
woman
writing
or
a
man
i
have
no
opinion
to
give
on
the
subject
rejoined
the
witness
it
is
intelligible
writing
and
that
is
all
that
comes
within
my
province
the
twelve
men
shifted
on
their
seats
and
surveyed
the
coroner
eagerly
why
did
he
not
proceed
evidently
he
was
not
quick
enough
to
suit
them
have
you
any
further
questions
for
this
witness
asked
that
gentleman
after
a
short
delay
their
nervousness
increased
but
no
one
ventured
to
follow
the
suggestion
a
poor
lot
i
call
them
a
very
poor
lot
i
would
have
found
plenty
of
questions
to
put
to
him
i
expected
to
see
the
man
clapp
called
next
but
i
was
disappointed
in
this
the
name
uttered
was
henshaw
and
the
person
who
rose
in
answer
to
it
was
a
tall
burly
man
with
a
shock
of
curly
black
hair
he
was
the
clerk
of
the
hotel
d
and
we
all
forgot
clapp
in
our
eagerness
to
hear
what
this
man
had
to
say
his
testimony
amounted
to
this
that
a
person
by
the
name
of
pope
was
registered
on
his
books
that
she
came
to
his
house
on
the
seventeenth
of
september
some
time
near
noon
that
she
was
not
alone
that
a
person
she
called
her
husband
accompanied
her
and
that
they
had
been
given
a
room
at
her
request
on
the
second
floor
overlooking
broadway
did
you
see
the
husband
was
it
his
handwriting
we
see
in
your
register
no
sir
he
came
into
the
office
but
he
did
not
approach
the
desk
it
was
she
who
registered
for
them
both
and
who
did
all
the
business
in
fact
i
thought
it
queer
but
took
it
for
granted
he
was
ill
for
he
held
his
head
very
much
down
and
acted
as
if
he
felt
disturbed
or
anxious
did
you
notice
him
closely
would
you
be
able
to
identify
him
on
sight
no
sir
i
should
not
he
looked
like
a
hundred
other
men
i
see
every
day
medium
in
height
and
build
with
brown
hair
and
brown
moustache
not
noticeable
in
any
way
sir
except
for
his
air
and
evident
desire
not
to
be
noticed
but
you
saw
him
later
no
sir
after
he
went
to
his
room
he
stayed
there
and
no
one
saw
him
i
did
not
even
see
him
when
he
left
the
house
his
wife
paid
the
bill
and
he
did
not
come
into
the
office
but
you
saw
her
well
you
would
know
her
again
perhaps
sir
but
i
doubt
it
she
wore
a
thick
veil
when
she
came
in
and
though
i
might
remember
her
voice
i
have
no
recollection
of
her
features
for
i
did
not
see
them
you
can
give
a
description
of
her
dress
though
surely
you
must
have
looked
long
enough
at
a
woman
who
wrote
her
own
and
her
husband
name
in
your
register
for
you
to
remember
her
clothes
yes
for
they
were
very
simple
she
had
on
what
is
called
a
gossamer
which
covered
her
from
neck
to
toe
and
on
her
head
a
hat
wrapped
all
about
with
a
blue
veil
so
that
she
might
have
worn
any
dress
under
that
gossamer
yes
sir
and
any
hat
under
that
veil
any
one
that
was
large
enough
sir
good
now
did
you
see
her
hands
not
to
remember
them
did
she
have
gloves
on
i
can
not
say
i
did
not
stand
and
watch
her
sir
that
is
a
pity
but
you
say
you
heard
her
voice
yes
sir
was
it
a
lady
voice
was
her
tone
refined
and
her
language
good
they
were
sir
when
did
they
leave
how
long
did
they
remain
in
your
house
they
left
in
the
evening
after
tea
i
should
say
how
on
foot
or
in
a
carriage
in
a
carriage
one
of
the
hacks
that
stand
in
front
of
the
door
did
they
bring
any
baggage
with
them
no
sir
did
they
take
any
away
the
lady
carried
a
parcel
what
kind
of
a
parcel
a
parcel
like
clothing
done
up
and
the
gentleman
i
did
not
see
him
was
she
dressed
the
same
in
going
as
in
coming
to
all
appearance
except
her
hat
that
was
smaller
she
had
the
gossamer
on
still
then
yes
sir
and
a
veil
yes
sir
only
that
the
hat
it
covered
was
smaller
yes
sir
and
now
how
did
you
account
to
yourself
for
the
parcel
and
the
change
of
hat
i
did
account
for
them
i
did
think
anything
about
them
at
the
time
but
since
i
have
had
the
subject
brought
to
my
mind
i
find
it
easy
enough
she
had
a
package
delivered
to
her
while
she
was
in
our
house
or
rather
packages
they
were
quite
numerous
i
believe
can
you
recall
the
circumstances
of
their
delivery
yes
sir
the
man
who
brought
the
packages
said
that
they
had
not
been
paid
for
so
i
allowed
him
to
carry
them
to
james
pope
room
when
he
went
away
he
had
but
one
small
parcel
with
him
the
rest
he
had
left
and
this
is
all
you
can
tell
us
about
this
singular
couple
had
they
no
meals
in
your
house
no
sir
the
gentleman
or
i
suppose
i
should
say
the
lady
sir
for
the
order
was
given
in
her
voice
sent
for
two
dozen
oysters
and
a
bottle
of
ale
which
were
furnished
to
them
in
their
rooms
but
they
did
come
to
the
is
the
boy
here
who
carried
up
those
articles
he
is
sir
and
the
chambermaid
who
attended
to
their
rooms
yes
sir
then
you
may
answer
this
question
and
we
will
excuse
you
how
was
the
gentleman
dressed
when
you
saw
him
in
a
linen
duster
and
a
felt
hat
let
the
jury
remember
that
and
now
let
us
hear
from
richard
clapp
is
richard
clapp
in
the
room
i
am
sir
answered
a
cheery
voice
and
a
lively
young
man
with
a
shrewd
eye
and
a
manner
popped
up
from
behind
a
portly
woman
on
a
side
seat
and
rapidly
came
forward
he
was
asked
several
questions
before
the
leading
one
which
we
all
expected
but
i
will
not
record
them
here
the
question
which
brought
the
reply
most
eagerly
anticipated
was
this
do
you
remember
being
sent
to
the
hotel
d
with
several
packages
for
a
james
pope
i
do
sir
did
you
deliver
them
in
person
did
you
see
the
lady
a
peculiar
look
crossed
his
face
and
we
all
leaned
forward
but
his
answer
brought
a
shock
of
disappointment
with
it
no
i
did
sir
she
would
let
me
in
she
bade
me
lay
the
things
down
by
the
door
and
wait
in
the
rear
hall
till
she
called
me
and
you
did
this
yes
sir
but
you
kept
your
eye
on
the
door
of
course
naturally
sir
and
saw
a
hand
steal
out
and
take
in
the
things
a
woman
hand
no
a
man
i
saw
the
white
cuff
and
how
long
was
it
before
they
called
you
fifteen
minutes
i
should
say
i
heard
a
voice
cry
and
seeing
their
door
open
i
went
toward
it
but
by
the
time
i
reached
it
it
was
shut
again
and
i
only
heard
the
lady
say
that
all
the
articles
but
the
shoes
were
satisfactory
and
would
i
thrust
the
bill
in
under
the
door
i
did
so
and
they
were
some
minutes
counting
out
the
change
but
presently
the
door
opened
slightly
and
i
saw
a
man
hand
holding
out
the
money
which
was
correct
to
the
cent
need
not
receipt
the
bill
cried
the
lady
from
somewhere
in
the
room
him
the
shoes
and
let
him
go
so
i
received
the
shoes
in
the
same
mysterious
way
i
had
the
money
and
seeing
no
reason
for
waiting
longer
pocketed
the
bills
and
returned
to
the
store
has
the
jury
any
further
questions
to
ask
the
witness
of
course
not
they
were
ninnies
all
of
them
and
but
contrary
to
my
expectation
one
of
them
did
perk
up
courage
and
wriggling
very
much
on
his
seat
ventured
to
ask
if
the
cuff
he
had
seen
on
the
hand
when
it
was
thrust
through
the
doorway
had
a
button
in
it
the
answer
was
disappointing
the
witness
had
not
noticed
any
the
juror
somewhat
abashed
sank
into
silence
at
which
another
of
the
precious
twelve
inspired
no
doubt
by
the
other
example
blurted
out
then
what
was
the
color
of
the
coat
sleeve
you
surely
can
remember
that
but
another
disappointment
awaited
us
he
did
not
wear
any
coat
it
was
a
shirt
sleeve
i
saw
a
shirt
sleeve
there
was
no
clue
in
that
a
visible
look
of
dejection
spread
through
the
room
which
was
not
dissipated
till
another
witness
stood
up
this
time
it
was
the
of
the
hotel
who
had
been
on
duty
that
day
his
testimony
was
brief
and
added
but
little
to
the
general
knowledge
he
had
been
summoned
more
than
once
by
these
mysterious
parties
but
only
to
receive
his
orders
through
a
closed
door
he
had
not
entered
the
room
at
all
he
was
followed
by
the
chambermaid
who
testified
that
she
was
in
the
room
once
while
they
were
there
that
she
saw
them
both
then
but
did
not
catch
a
glimpse
of
their
faces
pope
was
standing
in
the
window
almost
entirely
shielded
by
the
curtains
and
pope
was
busy
hanging
up
something
in
the
wardrobe
the
gentleman
had
on
his
duster
and
the
lady
her
gossamer
it
was
but
a
few
minutes
after
their
arrival
questioned
in
regard
to
the
state
of
the
room
after
they
left
it
she
said
that
there
was
a
lot
of
brown
paper
lying
about
marked
altman
but
nothing
else
that
did
not
belong
there
not
a
tag
nor
a
nor
a
bit
of
memorandum
lying
on
bureau
or
table
nothing
sir
so
far
as
i
mind
i
was
on
the
for
anything
sir
they
were
a
queer
couple
but
we
have
lots
of
queer
couples
at
our
house
and
the
most
i
notices
sir
is
those
what
remember
the
chambermaid
and
those
what
do
this
couple
was
of
the
kind
what
do
did
you
sweep
the
room
after
their
departure
i
always
does
they
went
late
so
i
swept
the
room
the
next
morning
and
threw
the
sweepings
away
of
course
of
course
would
you
have
me
keep
them
for
treasures
it
might
have
been
well
if
you
had
muttered
the
coroner
the
combings
from
the
lady
hair
might
have
been
very
useful
in
establishing
her
identity
the
porter
who
has
charge
of
the
lady
entrance
was
the
last
witness
from
this
house
he
had
been
on
duty
on
the
evening
in
question
and
had
noticed
this
couple
leaving
they
both
carried
packages
and
had
attracted
his
attention
first
by
the
long
duster
which
the
gentleman
wore
and
secondly
by
the
pains
they
both
took
not
to
be
observed
by
any
one
the
woman
was
veiled
as
had
already
been
said
and
the
man
held
his
package
in
such
a
way
as
to
shield
his
face
entirely
from
observation
so
that
you
would
not
know
him
if
you
saw
him
again
asked
the
coroner
exactly
sir
was
the
uncomprising
answer
as
he
sat
down
the
coroner
observed
you
will
note
from
this
testimony
gentlemen
that
this
couple
signing
themselves
and
james
pope
of
philadelphia
left
this
house
dressed
each
in
a
long
garment
eminently
fitted
for
purposes
of
concealment
he
in
a
linen
duster
and
she
in
a
gossamer
let
us
now
follow
this
couple
a
little
farther
and
see
what
became
of
these
disguising
articles
of
apparel
is
seth
brown
here
a
man
who
was
so
evidently
a
hackman
that
it
seemed
superfluous
to
ask
him
what
his
occupation
was
shuffled
forward
at
this
it
was
in
his
hack
that
this
couple
had
left
the
d
he
remembered
them
very
well
as
he
had
good
reason
to
first
because
the
man
paid
him
before
entering
the
carriage
saying
that
he
was
to
let
them
out
at
the
northwest
corner
of
madison
square
and
secondly
but
here
the
coroner
interrupted
him
to
ask
if
he
had
seen
the
gentleman
face
when
he
paid
him
the
answer
was
as
might
have
been
expected
no
it
was
dark
and
he
had
not
turned
his
head
did
you
think
it
queer
to
be
paid
before
you
reached
your
destination
yes
but
the
rest
was
queerer
after
i
had
taken
the
money
i
never
refuses
money
sir
and
was
expecting
him
to
get
into
the
hack
he
steps
up
to
me
again
and
says
in
a
lower
tone
than
before
wife
is
very
nervous
drive
slow
if
you
please
and
when
you
reach
the
place
i
have
named
watch
your
horses
carefully
for
if
they
should
move
while
she
is
getting
out
the
shock
would
throw
her
into
a
spasm
as
she
had
looked
very
pert
and
lively
i
thought
this
mighty
queer
and
i
tried
to
get
a
peep
at
his
face
but
he
was
too
smart
for
me
and
was
in
the
carriage
before
i
could
clap
my
eye
on
him
but
you
were
more
fortunate
when
they
got
out
you
surely
saw
one
or
both
of
them
then
no
sir
i
did
i
had
to
watch
the
horses
heads
you
know
i
should
like
to
be
the
cause
of
a
young
lady
having
a
spasm
do
you
know
in
what
direction
they
went
east
i
should
say
i
heard
them
laughing
long
after
i
had
whipped
up
my
horses
a
queer
couple
sir
that
puzzled
me
some
though
i
should
not
have
thought
of
them
twice
if
i
had
not
found
next
day
well
the
gentleman
linen
duster
and
the
neat
brown
gossamer
which
the
lady
had
worn
lying
folded
under
the
two
back
cushions
of
my
hack
a
present
for
which
i
was
very
much
obliged
to
them
but
which
i
was
not
long
allowed
to
enjoy
for
yesterday
the
police
well
well
no
matter
about
that
here
is
a
duster
and
here
is
a
brown
gossamer
are
these
the
articles
you
found
under
your
cushions
if
you
will
examine
the
neck
of
the
lady
gossamer
you
can
soon
tell
sir
there
was
a
small
hole
in
the
one
i
found
as
if
something
had
been
snipped
out
of
it
the
owner
name
most
likely
or
the
name
of
the
place
where
it
was
bought
suggested
the
coroner
holding
the
garment
up
to
view
so
as
to
reveal
a
square
hole
under
the
collar
that
it
cried
the
hackman
that
the
very
one
shame
i
say
to
spoil
a
new
garment
that
way
why
do
you
call
it
new
asked
the
coroner
because
it
has
a
mud
spot
or
even
a
mark
of
dust
upon
it
we
looked
it
all
over
my
wife
and
i
and
decided
it
had
not
been
long
off
the
shelf
a
pretty
good
haul
for
a
poor
man
like
me
and
if
the
police
but
here
he
was
cut
short
again
by
an
important
question
there
is
a
clock
but
a
short
distance
from
the
place
where
you
stopped
did
you
notice
what
time
it
was
when
you
drove
away
yes
sir
i
do
know
why
i
remember
it
but
i
do
as
i
turned
to
go
back
to
the
hotel
i
looked
up
at
this
clock
it
was
eleven
xii
the
keys
we
were
all
by
this
time
greatly
interested
in
the
proceedings
and
when
another
hackman
was
called
we
recognized
at
once
that
an
effort
was
about
to
be
made
to
connect
this
couple
with
the
one
who
had
alighted
at
van
burnam
door
the
witness
who
was
a
melancholy
chap
kept
his
stand
on
the
east
side
of
the
square
at
about
twenty
minutes
to
twelve
he
was
awakened
from
a
nap
he
had
been
taking
on
the
top
of
his
coach
by
a
sharp
rap
on
his
whip
arm
and
looking
down
he
saw
a
lady
and
gentleman
standing
at
the
door
of
his
vehicle
we
want
to
go
to
gramercy
park
said
the
lady
drive
us
there
at
once
i
nodded
for
what
is
the
use
of
wasting
words
when
it
can
be
avoided
and
they
stepped
at
once
into
the
coach
can
you
describe
them
tell
us
how
they
looked
i
never
notice
people
besides
it
was
dark
but
he
had
a
swell
air
and
she
was
pert
and
merry
for
she
laughed
as
she
closed
the
door
ca
you
remember
how
they
were
dressed
no
sir
she
had
on
something
that
flapped
about
her
shoulders
and
he
had
a
dark
hat
on
his
head
but
that
was
all
i
saw
did
you
see
his
face
not
a
bit
of
it
he
kept
it
turned
away
he
did
want
nobody
looking
at
she
did
all
the
business
then
you
saw
face
yes
for
a
minute
but
i
would
know
it
again
she
was
young
and
purty
and
her
hand
which
dropped
the
money
into
mine
was
small
but
i
could
say
no
more
not
if
you
was
to
give
me
the
town
did
you
know
that
the
house
you
stopped
at
was
van
burnam
and
that
it
was
supposed
to
be
empty
no
sir
i
not
one
of
the
swell
ones
my
acquaintances
live
in
another
part
of
the
town
but
you
noticed
that
the
house
was
dark
i
may
have
i
do
know
and
that
is
all
you
have
to
tell
us
about
them
no
sir
the
next
morning
which
was
yesterday
sir
as
i
was
out
the
coach
i
found
under
the
cushions
a
large
blue
veil
folded
and
lying
very
flat
but
it
had
been
slit
with
a
knife
and
could
not
be
worn
this
was
strange
too
and
while
more
than
one
person
about
me
ventured
an
opinion
i
muttered
to
myself
james
pope
his
mark
astonished
at
a
coincidence
which
so
completely
connected
the
occupants
of
the
two
coaches
but
the
coroner
was
able
to
produce
a
witness
whose
evidence
carried
the
matter
on
still
farther
a
policeman
in
full
uniform
testified
next
and
after
explaining
that
his
beat
led
him
from
madison
avenue
to
third
on
street
went
on
to
say
that
as
he
was
coming
up
this
street
on
tuesday
evening
some
few
minutes
before
midnight
he
encountered
somewhere
between
lexington
avenue
and
third
a
man
and
woman
walking
rapidly
towards
the
latter
avenue
each
carrying
a
parcel
of
some
dimensions
that
he
noted
them
because
they
seemed
so
merry
but
would
have
thought
nothing
of
it
if
he
had
not
presently
perceived
them
coming
back
without
the
parcels
they
were
chatting
more
gaily
than
ever
the
lady
wore
a
short
cape
and
the
gentleman
a
dark
coat
but
he
could
give
no
other
description
of
their
appearance
for
they
went
by
rapidly
and
he
was
more
interested
in
wondering
what
they
had
done
with
such
large
parcels
in
such
a
short
time
at
that
hour
of
night
than
in
noting
how
they
looked
or
whither
they
were
going
he
did
observe
however
that
they
proceeded
towards
madison
square
and
remembers
now
that
he
heard
a
carriage
suddenly
drive
away
from
that
direction
the
coroner
asked
him
but
one
question
had
the
lady
no
parcel
when
you
saw
her
last
i
saw
none
could
she
not
have
carried
one
under
her
cape
perhaps
if
it
was
small
enough
as
small
as
a
lady
hat
say
well
it
would
have
to
be
smaller
than
some
of
them
are
now
sir
and
so
terminated
this
portion
of
the
inquiry
a
short
delay
followed
the
withdrawal
of
this
witness
the
coroner
who
was
a
somewhat
portly
man
and
who
had
felt
the
heat
of
the
day
very
much
leaned
back
and
looked
anxious
while
the
jury
always
restless
moved
in
their
seats
like
a
set
of
and
seemed
to
long
for
the
hour
of
adjournment
notwithstanding
the
interest
which
everybody
but
themselves
seemed
to
take
in
this
exciting
investigation
finally
an
officer
who
had
been
sent
into
the
adjoining
room
came
back
with
a
gentleman
who
was
no
sooner
recognized
as
franklin
van
burnam
than
a
great
change
took
place
in
the
countenances
of
all
present
the
coroner
sat
forward
and
dropped
the
large
fan
he
had
been
industriously
using
for
the
last
few
minutes
the
jury
settled
down
and
the
whispering
of
the
many
curious
ones
about
me
grew
less
audible
and
finally
ceased
altogether
a
gentleman
of
the
family
was
about
to
be
interrogated
and
such
a
gentleman
i
have
purposely
refrained
from
describing
this
best
known
and
best
reputed
member
of
the
van
burnam
family
foreseeing
this
hour
when
he
would
attract
the
attention
of
a
hundred
eyes
and
when
his
appearance
would
require
our
special
notice
i
will
therefore
endeavor
to
picture
him
to
you
as
he
looked
on
this
memorable
morning
with
just
the
simple
warning
that
you
must
not
expect
me
to
see
with
the
eyes
of
a
young
girl
or
even
with
those
of
a
fashionable
society
woman
i
know
a
man
when
i
see
him
and
i
had
always
regarded
franklin
as
an
exceptionally
and
prepossessing
gentleman
but
i
shall
not
go
into
raptures
as
i
heard
a
girl
behind
me
doing
nor
do
i
feel
like
acknowledging
him
as
a
paragon
of
all
the
virtues
as
cunningham
did
that
evening
in
my
parlor
he
is
a
man
with
a
shape
not
unlike
his
brother
his
hair
is
dark
and
so
are
his
eyes
but
his
moustache
is
brown
and
his
complexion
quite
fair
he
carries
himself
with
distinction
and
though
his
countenance
in
repose
has
a
precise
air
that
is
not
perfectly
agreeable
it
has
when
he
speaks
or
smiles
an
expression
at
once
keen
and
amiable
on
this
occasion
he
failed
to
smile
and
though
his
elegance
was
sufficiently
apparent
his
worth
was
not
so
much
so
yet
the
impression
generally
made
was
favorable
as
one
could
perceive
from
the
air
of
respect
with
which
his
testimony
was
received
he
was
asked
many
questions
some
were
germane
to
the
matter
in
hand
and
some
seemed
to
strike
wide
of
all
mark
he
answered
them
all
courteously
showing
a
manly
composure
in
doing
so
that
served
to
calm
the
into
which
many
had
been
thrown
by
the
stories
of
the
two
hackmen
but
as
his
evidence
up
to
this
point
related
merely
to
minor
concerns
this
was
neither
strange
nor
conclusive
the
real
test
began
when
the
coroner
with
a
certain
bluster
which
may
have
been
meant
to
attract
the
attention
of
the
jury
now
visibly
waning
or
as
was
more
likely
may
have
been
the
unconscious
expression
of
a
secret
if
hitherto
well
concealed
embarrassment
asked
the
witness
whether
the
keys
to
his
father
front
door
had
any
duplicates
the
answer
came
in
a
decidedly
changed
tone
no
the
key
used
by
our
agent
opens
the
basement
door
only
the
coroner
showed
his
satisfaction
no
duplicates
he
repeated
then
you
will
have
no
difficulty
in
telling
us
where
the
keys
to
your
father
front
door
were
kept
during
the
family
absence
did
the
young
man
hesitate
or
was
it
but
imagination
on
my
part
they
were
usually
in
my
possession
usually
there
was
irony
in
the
tone
evidently
the
coroner
was
getting
the
better
of
his
embarrassment
if
he
had
felt
any
and
where
were
they
on
the
seventeenth
of
this
month
were
they
in
your
possession
then
no
sir
the
young
man
tried
to
look
calm
and
at
his
ease
but
the
difficulty
he
felt
in
doing
so
was
apparent
on
the
morning
of
that
day
he
continued
i
passed
them
over
to
my
brother
ah
here
was
something
tangible
as
well
as
important
i
began
to
fear
the
police
understood
themselves
only
too
well
and
so
did
the
whole
crowd
of
persons
there
assembled
a
groan
in
one
direction
was
answered
by
a
sigh
in
another
and
it
needed
all
the
coroner
authority
to
prevent
an
outbreak
meanwhile
van
burnam
stood
erect
and
unwavering
though
his
eye
showed
the
suffering
which
these
demonstrations
awakened
he
did
not
turn
in
the
direction
of
the
room
where
we
felt
sure
his
family
was
gathered
but
it
was
evident
that
his
thoughts
did
and
that
most
painfully
the
coroner
on
the
contrary
showed
little
or
no
feeling
he
had
brought
the
investigation
up
to
this
critical
point
and
felt
fully
competent
to
carry
it
farther
may
i
ask
said
he
where
the
transference
of
these
keys
took
place
i
gave
them
to
him
in
our
office
last
tuesday
morning
he
said
he
might
want
to
go
into
the
house
before
his
father
came
home
did
he
say
why
he
wanted
to
go
into
the
house
no
was
he
in
the
habit
of
going
into
it
alone
and
during
the
absence
no
had
he
any
clothes
there
or
any
articles
belonging
to
himself
or
his
wife
which
he
would
be
likely
to
wish
to
carry
away
no
yet
he
wanted
to
go
in
he
said
so
and
you
gave
him
the
keys
without
question
certainly
sir
was
that
not
opposed
to
your
usual
principles
to
your
way
of
doing
things
i
should
say
perhaps
but
principles
by
which
i
suppose
you
mean
my
usual
business
methods
do
not
govern
me
in
my
relations
with
my
brother
he
asked
me
a
favor
and
i
granted
it
it
would
have
to
have
been
a
much
larger
one
for
me
to
have
asked
an
explanation
from
him
before
doing
so
yet
you
are
not
on
good
terms
with
your
brother
at
least
you
have
not
had
the
name
of
being
for
some
time
we
have
had
no
quarrel
did
he
return
the
keys
you
lent
him
no
have
you
seen
them
since
no
would
you
know
them
if
they
were
shown
you
i
would
know
them
if
they
unlocked
our
front
door
but
you
would
not
know
them
on
sight
i
do
think
so
van
burnam
it
is
disagreeable
for
me
to
go
into
family
matters
but
if
you
have
had
no
quarrel
with
your
brother
how
comes
it
that
you
and
he
have
had
so
little
intercourse
of
late
he
has
been
in
connecticut
and
i
at
long
branch
is
not
that
a
good
answer
sir
good
but
not
good
enough
you
have
a
common
office
in
new
york
have
you
not
certainly
the
firm
office
and
you
sometimes
meet
there
even
while
residing
in
different
localities
yes
our
business
calls
us
in
at
times
and
then
we
meet
of
course
do
you
talk
when
you
meet
talk
of
other
matters
besides
business
i
mean
are
your
relations
friendly
do
you
show
the
same
spirit
towards
each
other
as
you
did
three
years
ago
say
we
are
older
perhaps
we
are
not
quite
so
voluble
but
do
you
feel
the
same
no
i
see
you
will
have
it
and
so
i
will
no
longer
hold
back
the
truth
we
are
not
as
brotherly
in
our
intercourse
as
we
used
to
be
but
there
is
no
animosity
between
us
i
have
a
decided
regard
for
my
brother
this
was
said
quite
nobly
and
i
liked
him
for
it
but
i
began
to
feel
that
perhaps
it
had
been
for
the
best
after
all
that
i
had
never
been
intimate
with
the
family
but
i
must
not
forestall
either
events
or
my
opinions
is
there
any
reason
it
is
the
coroner
of
course
who
is
speaking
why
there
should
be
any
falling
off
in
your
mutual
confidence
has
your
brother
done
anything
to
displease
you
we
did
not
like
his
marriage
was
it
an
unhappy
one
it
was
not
a
suitable
one
did
you
know
van
burnam
well
that
you
say
this
yes
i
knew
her
but
the
rest
of
the
family
did
not
yet
they
shared
in
your
disapprobation
they
felt
the
marriage
more
than
i
did
the
lady
excuse
me
i
never
like
to
speak
ill
of
the
sex
was
not
lacking
in
good
sense
or
virtue
but
she
was
not
the
person
we
had
a
right
to
expect
howard
to
marry
and
you
let
him
see
that
you
thought
so
how
could
we
do
otherwise
even
after
she
had
been
his
wife
for
some
months
we
could
not
like
her
did
your
brother
i
am
sorry
to
press
this
matter
ever
show
that
he
felt
your
change
of
conduct
towards
him
i
find
it
equally
hard
to
answer
was
the
quick
reply
my
brother
is
of
an
affectionate
nature
and
he
has
some
if
not
all
of
the
pride
i
think
he
did
feel
it
though
he
never
said
so
he
is
not
without
loyalty
to
his
wife
van
burnam
of
whom
does
the
firm
doing
business
under
the
name
of
van
burnam
sons
consist
of
the
three
persons
mentioned
no
others
no
has
there
ever
been
in
your
hearing
any
threat
made
by
the
senior
partner
of
dissolving
this
firm
as
it
stands
i
have
heard
i
felt
sorry
for
this
strong
but
far
from
heartless
man
but
i
would
not
have
stopped
the
inquiry
at
this
point
if
i
could
i
was
far
too
curious
i
have
heard
my
father
say
that
he
would
withdraw
if
howard
did
not
whether
he
would
have
done
so
i
consider
open
to
doubt
my
father
is
a
just
man
and
never
fails
to
do
the
right
thing
though
he
sometimes
speaks
with
unnecessary
harshness
he
made
the
threat
however
yes
and
howard
heard
it
or
of
it
i
can
not
say
which
van
burnam
have
you
noticed
any
change
in
your
brother
since
this
threat
was
uttered
how
sir
what
change
in
his
treatment
of
his
wife
or
in
his
attitude
towards
yourself
i
have
not
seen
him
in
the
company
of
his
wife
since
they
went
to
haddam
as
for
his
conduct
towards
myself
i
can
say
no
more
than
i
have
already
we
have
never
forgotten
that
we
are
children
of
one
mother
van
burnam
how
many
times
have
you
seen
howard
van
burnam
several
more
frequently
before
they
were
married
than
since
you
were
in
your
brother
confidence
then
at
that
time
knew
he
was
contemplating
marriage
it
was
in
my
endeavors
to
prevent
the
match
that
i
saw
so
much
of
miss
louise
stapleton
ah
i
am
glad
of
the
explanation
i
was
just
going
to
inquire
why
you
of
all
members
of
the
family
were
the
only
one
to
know
your
wife
by
sight
the
witness
considering
this
question
answered
made
no
reply
but
the
next
suggestion
could
not
be
passed
over
if
you
saw
van
burnam
so
often
you
are
acquainted
with
her
personal
appearance
sufficiently
so
as
well
as
i
know
that
of
my
ordinary
was
she
light
or
dark
she
had
brown
hair
similar
to
this
the
lock
held
up
was
the
one
which
had
been
cut
from
the
head
of
the
dead
girl
yes
somewhat
similar
to
that
the
tone
was
cold
but
he
could
not
hide
his
distress
van
burnam
have
you
looked
well
at
the
woman
who
was
found
murdered
in
your
father
house
i
have
sir
is
there
anything
in
her
general
outline
or
in
such
features
as
have
escaped
disfigurement
to
remind
you
of
howard
van
burnam
i
may
have
thought
so
at
first
glance
he
replied
with
decided
effort
and
did
you
change
your
mind
at
the
second
he
looked
troubled
but
answered
firmly
no
i
can
not
say
that
i
did
but
you
must
not
regard
my
opinion
as
conclusive
he
hastily
added
my
knowledge
of
the
lady
was
comparatively
slight
the
jury
will
take
that
into
account
all
we
want
to
know
now
is
whether
you
can
assert
from
any
knowledge
you
have
or
from
anything
to
be
noted
in
the
body
itself
that
it
is
not
howard
van
burnam
i
can
not
and
with
this
solemn
assertion
his
examination
closed
the
remainder
of
the
day
was
taken
up
in
trying
to
prove
a
similarity
between
van
burnam
handwriting
and
that
of
james
pope
as
seen
in
the
register
of
the
hotel
d
and
on
the
order
sent
to
altman
but
the
only
conclusion
reached
was
that
the
latter
might
be
the
former
disguised
and
even
on
this
point
the
experts
differed
xiii
howard
van
burnam
the
gentleman
who
stepped
from
the
carriage
and
entered
van
house
at
twelve
that
night
produced
so
little
impression
upon
me
that
i
went
to
bed
satisfied
that
no
result
would
follow
these
efforts
at
identification
and
so
i
told
gryce
when
he
arrived
next
morning
but
he
seemed
by
no
means
disconcerted
and
merely
requested
that
i
would
submit
to
one
more
trial
to
which
i
gave
my
consent
and
he
departed
i
could
have
asked
him
a
string
of
questions
but
his
manner
did
not
invite
them
and
for
some
reason
i
was
too
wary
to
show
an
interest
in
this
tragedy
superior
to
that
felt
by
every
person
connected
with
it
at
ten
i
was
in
my
old
seat
in
the
the
same
crowd
with
different
faces
confronted
me
amid
which
the
twelve
stolid
countenances
of
the
jury
looked
like
old
friends
howard
van
burnam
was
the
witness
called
and
as
he
came
forward
and
stood
in
full
view
of
us
all
the
interest
of
the
occasion
reached
its
climax
his
countenance
wore
a
reckless
look
that
did
not
serve
to
prepossess
him
with
the
people
at
whose
mercy
he
stood
but
he
did
not
seem
to
care
and
waited
for
the
coroner
questions
with
an
air
of
ease
which
was
in
direct
contrast
to
the
drawn
and
troubled
faces
of
his
father
and
brother
just
visible
in
the
background
coroner
dahl
surveyed
him
a
few
minutes
before
speaking
then
he
quietly
asked
if
he
had
seen
the
dead
body
of
the
woman
who
had
been
found
lying
under
a
fallen
piece
of
furniture
in
his
father
house
he
replied
that
he
had
before
she
was
removed
from
the
house
or
after
it
after
did
you
recognize
it
was
it
the
body
of
any
one
you
know
i
do
not
think
so
has
your
wife
who
was
missing
yesterday
been
heard
from
yet
van
burnam
not
to
my
knowledge
sir
had
she
not
that
is
your
wife
a
complexion
similar
to
that
of
the
dead
woman
just
alluded
to
she
had
a
fair
skin
and
brown
hair
if
that
is
what
you
mean
but
these
attributes
are
common
to
too
many
women
for
me
to
give
them
any
weight
in
an
attempted
identification
of
this
importance
had
they
no
other
similar
points
of
a
less
general
character
was
not
your
wife
of
a
slight
and
graceful
build
such
as
is
attributed
to
the
subject
of
this
inquiry
my
wife
was
slight
and
she
was
graceful
common
attributes
also
and
your
wife
had
a
scar
yes
on
the
left
ankle
yes
which
the
deceased
also
has
that
i
do
not
know
they
say
so
but
i
had
no
interest
in
looking
why
may
i
ask
did
you
not
think
it
a
remarkable
coincidence
the
young
man
frowned
it
was
the
first
token
of
feeling
he
had
given
i
was
not
on
the
for
coincidences
was
his
cold
reply
i
had
no
reason
to
think
this
unhappy
victim
of
an
unknown
man
brutality
my
wife
and
so
did
not
allow
myself
to
be
moved
by
even
such
a
fact
as
this
you
had
no
reason
repeated
the
coroner
to
think
this
woman
your
wife
had
you
any
reason
to
think
she
was
not
yes
will
you
give
us
that
reason
i
had
more
than
one
first
my
wife
would
never
wear
the
clothes
i
saw
on
the
girl
whose
dead
body
was
shown
to
me
secondly
she
would
never
go
to
any
house
alone
with
a
man
at
the
hour
testified
to
by
one
of
your
witnesses
a
not
with
any
man
i
did
not
mean
to
include
her
husband
in
my
remark
of
course
but
as
i
did
not
take
her
to
gramercy
park
the
fact
that
the
deceased
woman
entered
an
empty
house
accompanied
by
a
man
is
proof
enough
to
me
that
she
was
not
louise
van
burnam
when
did
you
part
with
your
wife
on
monday
morning
at
the
depot
in
haddam
did
you
know
where
she
was
going
i
knew
where
she
said
she
was
going
and
where
was
that
may
i
ask
to
new
york
to
interview
my
father
but
your
father
was
not
in
new
york
he
was
daily
expected
here
the
steamer
on
which
he
had
sailed
from
southampton
was
due
on
tuesday
had
she
an
interest
in
seeing
your
father
was
there
any
special
reason
why
she
should
leave
you
for
doing
so
she
thought
so
she
thought
he
would
become
reconciled
to
her
entrance
into
our
family
if
he
should
see
her
suddenly
and
without
prejudiced
persons
standing
by
and
did
you
fear
to
mar
the
effect
of
this
meeting
if
you
accompanied
her
no
for
i
doubted
if
the
meeting
would
ever
take
place
i
had
no
sympathy
with
her
schemes
and
did
not
wish
to
give
her
the
sanction
of
my
presence
was
that
the
reason
you
let
her
go
to
new
york
alone
yes
had
you
no
other
no
why
did
you
follow
her
then
in
less
than
five
hours
because
i
was
uneasy
because
i
also
wanted
to
see
my
father
because
i
am
a
man
accustomed
to
carry
out
every
impulse
and
impulse
led
me
that
day
in
the
direction
of
my
somewhat
headstrong
wife
did
you
know
where
your
wife
intended
to
spend
the
night
i
did
not
she
has
many
friends
or
at
least
i
have
in
the
city
and
i
concluded
she
would
go
to
one
of
them
as
she
did
when
did
you
arrive
in
the
city
before
ten
yes
a
few
minutes
before
did
you
try
to
find
your
wife
no
i
went
directly
to
the
club
did
you
try
to
find
her
the
next
morning
no
i
had
heard
that
the
steamer
had
not
yet
been
sighted
off
fire
island
so
considered
the
effort
unnecessary
why
what
connection
is
there
between
this
fact
and
an
endeavor
on
your
part
to
find
your
wife
a
very
close
one
she
had
come
to
new
york
to
throw
herself
at
my
father
feet
now
she
could
only
do
this
at
the
steamer
or
in
why
do
you
not
proceed
van
burnam
i
will
i
do
not
know
why
i
stopped
or
in
his
own
house
in
his
own
house
in
the
house
in
gramercy
park
do
you
mean
yes
he
has
no
other
the
house
in
which
this
dead
girl
was
found
yes
impatiently
did
you
think
she
might
throw
herself
at
his
feet
there
she
said
she
might
and
as
she
is
romantic
foolishly
romantic
i
thought
her
fully
capable
of
doing
so
and
so
you
did
not
seek
her
in
the
morning
no
sir
how
about
the
afternoon
this
was
a
close
question
we
saw
that
he
was
affected
by
it
though
he
tried
to
carry
it
off
bravely
i
did
not
see
her
in
the
afternoon
i
was
in
a
restless
frame
of
mind
and
did
not
remain
in
the
city
ah
indeed
and
where
did
you
go
unless
necessary
i
prefer
not
to
say
it
is
necessary
i
went
to
coney
island
alone
yes
did
you
see
anybody
there
you
know
no
and
when
did
you
return
at
midnight
when
did
you
reach
your
rooms
later
how
much
later
two
or
three
hours
and
where
were
you
during
those
hours
i
was
walking
the
streets
the
ease
the
quietness
with
which
he
made
these
acknowledgments
were
remarkable
the
jury
to
a
man
honored
him
with
a
prolonged
stare
and
the
crowd
scarcely
breathed
during
their
utterance
at
the
last
sentence
a
murmur
broke
out
at
which
he
raised
his
head
and
with
an
air
of
surprise
surveyed
the
people
before
him
though
he
must
have
known
what
their
astonishment
meant
he
neither
quailed
nor
blanched
and
while
not
in
reality
a
handsome
man
he
certainly
looked
handsome
at
this
moment
i
did
not
know
what
to
think
so
forbore
to
think
anything
meanwhile
the
examination
went
on
van
burnam
i
have
been
told
that
the
locket
i
see
there
dangling
from
your
contains
a
lock
of
your
wife
hair
is
it
so
i
have
a
lock
of
her
hair
in
this
yes
here
is
a
lock
clipped
from
the
head
of
the
unknown
woman
whose
identity
we
seek
have
you
any
objection
to
comparing
the
two
it
is
not
an
agreeable
task
you
have
set
me
was
the
imperturbable
response
but
i
have
no
objection
to
doing
what
you
ask
and
calmly
lifting
the
chain
he
took
off
the
locket
opened
it
and
held
it
out
courteously
toward
the
coroner
may
i
ask
you
to
make
the
first
comparison
he
said
the
coroner
taking
the
locket
laid
the
two
locks
of
brown
hair
together
and
after
a
moment
contemplation
of
them
both
surveyed
the
young
man
seriously
and
remarked
they
are
of
the
same
shade
shall
i
pass
them
down
to
the
jury
howard
bowed
you
would
have
thought
he
was
in
a
and
in
the
act
of
bestowing
a
favor
but
his
brother
franklin
showed
a
very
different
countenance
and
as
for
their
father
one
could
not
even
see
his
face
he
so
persistently
held
up
his
hand
before
it
the
jury
now
passed
the
locket
along
with
many
sly
nods
and
a
few
whispered
words
when
it
came
back
to
the
coroner
he
took
it
and
handed
it
to
van
burnam
saying
i
wish
you
would
observe
the
similarity
for
yourself
i
can
hardly
detect
any
difference
between
them
thank
you
i
am
willing
to
take
your
word
for
it
replied
the
young
man
with
most
astonishing
and
coroner
and
jury
for
a
moment
looked
baffled
and
even
gryce
of
whose
face
i
caught
a
passing
glimpse
at
this
instant
stared
at
the
head
of
his
cane
as
if
it
were
of
thicker
wood
than
he
expected
and
had
more
knotty
points
on
it
than
even
his
accustomed
hand
liked
to
encounter
another
effort
was
not
out
of
place
however
and
the
coroner
summoning
up
some
of
the
pompous
severity
he
found
useful
at
times
asked
the
witness
if
his
attention
had
been
drawn
to
the
dead
woman
hands
he
acknowledged
that
it
had
the
physician
who
made
the
autopsy
urged
me
to
look
at
them
and
i
did
they
were
certainly
very
like
my
wife
only
like
i
can
not
say
that
they
were
my
wife
do
you
wish
me
to
perjure
myself
a
man
should
know
his
wife
hands
as
well
as
he
knows
her
face
very
likely
and
you
are
ready
to
swear
these
were
not
the
hands
of
your
wife
i
am
ready
to
swear
i
did
not
so
consider
them
and
that
is
all
that
is
all
the
coroner
frowned
and
cast
a
glance
at
the
jury
they
needed
prodding
now
and
then
and
this
is
the
way
he
prodded
them
as
soon
as
they
gave
signs
of
recognizing
the
hint
he
gave
them
he
turned
back
and
renewed
his
examination
in
these
words
van
burnam
did
your
brother
at
your
request
hand
you
the
keys
of
your
father
house
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
this
tragedy
occurred
he
did
have
you
those
keys
now
i
have
not
what
have
you
done
with
them
did
you
return
them
to
your
brother
no
i
see
where
your
inquiries
are
tending
and
i
do
not
suppose
you
will
believe
my
simple
word
but
i
lost
the
keys
on
the
day
i
received
them
that
is
why
well
you
may
continue
van
burnam
i
have
no
more
to
say
my
sentence
was
not
worth
completing
the
murmur
which
rose
about
him
seemed
to
show
dissatisfaction
but
he
remained
imperturbable
or
rather
like
a
man
who
did
not
hear
i
began
to
feel
a
most
painful
interest
in
the
inquiry
and
dreaded
while
i
anxiously
anticipated
his
further
examination
you
lost
the
keys
may
i
ask
when
and
where
that
i
do
not
know
they
were
missing
when
i
searched
for
them
missing
from
my
pocket
i
mean
ah
and
when
did
you
search
for
them
the
next
day
after
i
had
heard
of
of
what
had
taken
place
in
my
father
house
the
hesitations
were
those
of
a
man
weighing
his
reply
they
told
on
the
jury
as
all
such
hesitations
do
and
made
the
coroner
lose
an
atom
of
the
respect
he
had
hitherto
shown
this
witness
and
you
do
not
know
what
became
of
them
no
or
into
whose
hands
they
fell
no
but
probably
into
the
hands
of
the
wretch
to
the
astonishment
of
everybody
he
was
on
the
verge
of
vehemence
but
becoming
sensible
of
it
he
controlled
himself
with
a
suddenness
that
was
almost
shocking
find
the
murderer
of
this
poor
girl
said
he
with
a
quiet
air
that
was
more
thrilling
than
any
display
of
passion
and
ask
where
he
got
the
keys
with
which
he
opened
the
door
of
my
father
house
at
midnight
was
this
a
challenge
or
just
the
natural
outburst
of
an
innocent
man
neither
the
jury
nor
the
coroner
seemed
to
know
the
former
looking
startled
and
the
latter
nonplussed
but
gryce
who
had
moved
now
into
view
smoothed
the
head
of
his
cane
with
quite
a
loving
touch
and
did
not
seem
at
this
moment
to
feel
its
inequalities
objectionable
we
will
certainly
try
to
follow
your
advice
the
coroner
assured
him
meanwhile
we
must
ask
how
many
rings
your
wife
is
in
the
habit
of
wearing
five
two
on
the
left
hand
and
three
on
the
right
do
you
know
these
rings
i
do
better
than
you
know
her
hands
as
well
sir
were
they
on
her
hands
when
you
parted
from
her
in
haddam
they
were
did
she
always
wear
them
almost
always
indeed
i
do
not
ever
remember
seeing
her
take
off
more
than
one
of
them
which
one
the
ruby
with
the
diamond
setting
had
the
dead
girl
any
rings
on
when
you
saw
her
no
sir
did
you
look
to
see
i
think
i
did
in
the
first
shock
of
the
discovery
and
you
saw
none
no
sir
and
from
this
you
concluded
she
was
not
your
wife
from
this
and
other
things
yet
you
must
have
seen
that
the
woman
was
in
the
habit
of
wearing
rings
even
if
they
were
not
on
her
hands
at
that
moment
why
sir
what
should
i
know
about
her
habits
is
not
that
a
ring
i
see
now
on
your
little
finger
it
is
my
seal
ring
which
i
always
wear
will
you
pull
it
off
pull
it
off
if
you
please
it
is
a
simple
test
i
am
requiring
of
you
sir
the
witness
looked
astonished
but
pulled
off
the
ring
at
once
here
it
is
said
he
thank
you
but
i
do
not
want
it
i
merely
want
you
to
look
at
your
finger
the
witness
complied
evidently
more
nonplussed
than
disturbed
by
this
command
do
you
see
any
difference
between
that
finger
and
the
one
next
it
yes
there
is
a
mark
about
my
little
finger
showing
where
the
ring
has
pressed
very
good
there
were
such
marks
on
the
fingers
of
the
dead
girl
who
as
you
say
had
no
rings
on
i
saw
them
and
perhaps
you
did
yourself
i
did
not
i
did
not
look
closely
enough
they
were
on
the
little
finger
of
the
right
hand
on
the
marriage
finger
of
the
left
and
on
the
forefinger
of
the
same
on
which
fingers
did
your
wife
wear
rings
on
those
same
fingers
sir
but
i
will
not
accept
this
fact
as
proving
her
identity
with
the
deceased
most
women
do
wear
rings
and
on
those
very
fingers
the
coroner
was
nettled
but
he
was
not
discouraged
he
exchanged
looks
with
gryce
but
nothing
further
passed
between
them
and
we
were
left
to
conjecture
what
this
interchange
of
glances
meant
the
witness
who
did
not
seem
to
be
affected
either
by
the
character
of
this
examination
or
by
the
conjectures
to
which
it
gave
rise
preserved
his
and
eyed
the
coroner
as
he
might
any
other
questioner
with
suitable
respect
but
with
no
fear
and
but
little
impatience
and
yet
he
must
have
known
the
horrible
suspicion
darkening
the
minds
of
many
people
present
and
suspected
even
if
against
his
will
that
this
examination
significant
as
it
was
was
but
the
forerunner
of
another
and
yet
more
serious
one
you
are
very
determined
remarked
the
coroner
in
beginning
again
not
to
accept
the
very
substantial
proofs
presented
you
of
the
identity
between
the
object
of
this
inquiry
and
your
missing
wife
but
we
are
not
yet
ready
to
give
up
the
struggle
and
so
i
must
ask
if
you
heard
the
description
given
by
miss
ferguson
of
the
manner
in
which
your
wife
was
dressed
on
leaving
haddam
i
have
was
it
a
correct
account
did
she
wear
a
black
and
white
plaid
silk
and
a
hat
trimmed
with
various
colored
ribbons
and
flowers
she
did
do
you
remember
the
hat
were
you
with
her
when
she
bought
it
or
did
you
ever
have
your
attention
drawn
to
it
in
any
particular
way
i
remember
the
hat
is
this
it
van
burnam
i
was
watching
howard
and
the
start
he
gave
was
so
pronounced
and
the
emotion
he
displayed
was
in
such
violent
contrast
to
the
he
had
maintained
up
to
this
point
that
i
was
held
by
the
shock
i
received
and
forebore
to
look
at
the
object
which
the
coroner
had
suddenly
held
up
for
inspection
but
when
i
did
turn
my
head
towards
it
i
recognized
at
once
the
hat
which
gryce
had
brought
in
from
the
third
room
of
van
burnam
house
on
the
evening
i
was
there
and
realized
almost
in
the
same
breath
that
great
as
this
mystery
had
hitherto
seemed
it
was
likely
to
prove
yet
greater
before
its
proper
elucidation
was
arrived
at
was
that
found
in
my
father
house
where
where
was
that
hat
found
stammered
the
witness
so
far
forgetting
himself
as
to
point
towards
the
object
in
question
it
was
found
by
gryce
in
a
closet
off
your
father
a
short
time
after
the
dead
girl
was
carried
out
i
do
believe
it
vociferated
the
young
man
paling
with
something
more
than
anger
and
shaking
from
head
to
foot
shall
i
put
gryce
on
his
oath
again
asked
the
coroner
mildly
the
young
man
stared
evidently
these
words
failed
to
reach
his
understanding
it
your
wife
hat
persisted
the
coroner
with
very
little
mercy
do
you
recognize
it
for
the
one
in
which
she
left
haddam
would
to
god
i
did
not
burst
in
vehement
distress
from
the
witness
who
at
the
next
moment
broke
down
altogether
and
looked
about
for
the
support
of
his
brother
arm
franklin
came
forward
and
the
two
brothers
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
face
of
the
whole
surging
mass
of
before
them
arm
in
arm
but
with
very
different
expressions
on
their
two
proud
faces
howard
was
the
first
to
speak
if
that
was
found
in
the
parlors
of
my
father
house
he
cried
then
the
woman
who
was
killed
there
was
my
wife
and
he
started
away
with
a
wild
air
towards
the
door
where
are
you
going
asked
the
coroner
quietly
while
an
officer
stepped
softly
before
him
and
his
brother
compassionately
drew
him
back
by
the
arm
i
am
going
to
take
her
from
that
horrible
place
she
is
my
wife
father
you
would
not
wish
her
to
remain
in
that
spot
for
another
moment
would
you
while
we
have
a
house
we
call
our
own
van
burnam
the
senior
who
had
shrunk
as
far
from
sight
as
possible
through
these
painful
demonstrations
rose
up
at
these
words
from
his
agonized
son
and
making
him
an
encouraging
gesture
walked
hastily
out
of
the
room
seeing
which
the
young
man
became
calmer
and
though
he
did
not
cease
to
shudder
tried
to
restrain
his
first
grief
which
to
those
who
looked
closely
at
him
was
evidently
very
sincere
i
would
not
believe
it
was
she
he
cried
in
total
disregard
of
the
presence
he
was
in
i
believe
it
but
now
a
certain
pitiful
gesture
finished
the
sentence
and
neither
coroner
nor
jury
seemed
to
know
just
how
to
proceed
the
conduct
of
the
young
man
being
so
markedly
different
from
what
they
had
expected
after
a
short
pause
painful
enough
to
all
concerned
the
coroner
perceiving
that
very
little
could
be
done
with
the
witness
under
the
circumstances
adjourned
the
sitting
till
afternoon

these

are
proud
most
vilely
proud

a
serious
admission
i
went
at
once
to
a
restaurant
i
ate
because
it
was
time
to
eat
and
because
any
occupation
was
welcome
that
would
pass
away
the
hours
of
waiting
i
was
troubled
and
i
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
myself
i
was
no
friend
to
the
van
burnams
i
did
not
like
them
and
certainly
had
never
approved
of
any
of
them
but
franklin
and
yet
i
found
myself
altogether
disturbed
over
the
morning
developments
howard
emotion
having
appealed
to
me
in
spite
of
my
prejudices
i
could
not
but
think
ill
of
him
his
conduct
not
being
such
as
i
could
honestly
commend
but
i
found
myself
more
ready
to
listen
to
the
involuntary
pleadings
of
my
own
heart
in
his
behalf
than
i
had
been
prior
to
his
testimony
and
its
somewhat
startling
termination
but
they
were
not
through
with
him
yet
and
after
the
longest
three
hours
i
ever
passed
we
were
again
convened
before
the
coroner
i
saw
howard
as
soon
as
anybody
did
he
came
in
arm
in
arm
as
before
with
his
faithful
brother
and
sat
down
in
a
retired
corner
behind
the
coroner
but
he
was
soon
called
forward
his
face
when
the
light
fell
on
it
was
startling
to
most
of
us
it
was
as
much
changed
as
if
years
instead
of
hours
had
elapsed
since
last
we
saw
it
no
longer
reckless
in
its
expression
nor
easy
nor
politely
patient
it
showed
in
its
every
lineament
that
he
had
not
only
passed
through
a
hurricane
of
passion
but
that
the
bitterness
which
had
been
its
worst
feature
had
not
passed
with
the
storm
but
had
settled
into
the
core
of
his
nature
disturbing
its
equilibrium
forever
my
emotions
were
not
allayed
by
the
sight
but
i
kept
all
expression
of
them
out
of
view
i
must
be
sure
of
his
integrity
before
giving
rein
to
my
sympathies
the
jury
moved
and
sat
up
quite
alert
when
they
saw
him
i
think
that
if
these
especial
twelve
men
could
have
a
murder
case
to
investigate
every
day
they
would
grow
quite
in
time
van
burnam
made
no
demonstration
evidently
there
was
not
likely
to
be
a
repetition
of
the
morning
display
of
passion
he
had
been
iron
in
his
impassibility
at
that
time
but
he
was
steel
now
and
steel
which
had
been
through
the
fiercest
of
fires
the
opening
question
of
the
coroner
showed
by
what
experience
these
fires
had
been
kindled
van
burnam
i
have
been
told
that
you
have
visited
the
morgue
in
the
interim
which
has
elapsed
since
i
last
questioned
you
is
that
true
it
is
did
you
in
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
examine
the
remains
of
the
woman
whose
death
we
are
investigating
attentively
enough
to
enable
you
to
say
now
whether
they
are
those
of
your
missing
wife
i
have
the
body
is
that
of
louise
van
burnam
i
crave
your
pardon
and
that
of
the
jury
for
my
former
obstinacy
in
refusing
to
recognize
it
i
thought
myself
fully
justified
in
the
stand
i
took
i
see
now
that
i
was
not
the
coroner
made
no
answer
there
was
no
sympathy
between
him
and
this
young
man
yet
he
did
not
fail
in
a
decent
show
of
respect
perhaps
because
he
did
feel
some
sympathy
for
the
witness
unhappy
father
and
brother
you
then
acknowledge
the
victim
to
have
been
your
wife
i
do
it
is
a
point
gained
and
i
compliment
the
jury
upon
it
we
can
now
proceed
to
settle
if
possible
the
identity
of
the
person
who
accompanied
van
burnam
into
your
father
house
wait
cried
van
burnam
with
a
strange
air
acknowledge
i
was
that
it
was
coolly
almost
fiercely
said
but
it
was
an
admission
that
wellnigh
created
a
hubbub
even
the
coroner
seemed
moved
and
cast
a
glance
at
gryce
which
showed
his
surprise
to
be
greater
than
his
discretion
you
acknowledge
he
began
but
the
witness
did
not
let
him
finish
i
acknowledge
that
i
was
the
person
who
accompanied
her
into
that
empty
house
but
i
do
not
acknowledge
that
i
killed
her
she
was
alive
and
well
when
i
left
her
difficult
as
it
is
for
me
to
prove
it
it
was
the
realization
of
this
difficulty
which
made
me
perjure
myself
this
morning
so
murmured
the
coroner
with
another
glance
at
gryce
you
acknowledge
that
you
perjured
yourself
will
the
room
be
quiet
but
the
lull
came
slowly
the
contrast
between
the
appearance
of
this
elegant
young
man
and
the
significant
admissions
he
had
just
made
admissions
which
to
three
quarters
of
the
persons
there
meant
more
much
more
than
he
acknowledged
was
certainly
such
as
to
provoke
interest
of
the
deepest
kind
i
felt
like
giving
rein
to
my
own
feelings
and
was
not
surprised
at
the
patience
shown
by
the
coroner
but
order
was
restored
at
last
and
the
inquiry
proceeded
we
are
then
to
consider
the
testimony
given
by
you
this
morning
as
null
and
void
yes
so
far
as
it
contradicts
what
i
have
just
stated
ah
then
you
will
no
doubt
be
willing
to
give
us
your
evidence
again
certainly
if
you
will
be
so
kind
as
to
question
me
very
well
where
did
your
wife
and
yourself
first
meet
after
your
arrival
in
new
york
in
the
street
near
my
office
she
was
coming
to
see
me
but
i
prevailed
upon
her
to
go
uptown
what
time
was
this
after
ten
and
before
noon
i
can
not
give
the
exact
hour
and
where
did
you
go
to
a
hotel
on
broadway
you
have
already
heard
of
our
visit
there
you
are
then
the
james
pope
whose
wife
registered
in
the
books
of
the
hotel
d
on
the
seventeenth
of
this
month
i
have
said
so
and
may
i
ask
for
what
purpose
you
used
this
disguise
and
allowed
your
wife
to
sign
a
wrong
name
to
satisfy
a
freak
she
considered
it
the
best
way
of
covering
up
a
scheme
she
had
formed
which
was
to
awaken
the
interest
of
my
father
under
the
name
and
appearance
of
a
stranger
and
not
to
inform
him
who
she
was
till
he
had
given
some
evidence
of
partiality
for
her
ah
but
for
such
an
end
was
it
necessary
for
her
to
assume
a
strange
name
before
she
saw
your
father
and
for
you
both
to
conduct
yourselves
in
the
mysterious
way
you
did
all
that
day
and
evening
i
do
not
know
she
thought
so
and
i
humored
her
i
was
tired
of
working
against
her
and
was
willing
she
should
have
her
own
way
for
a
time
and
for
this
reason
you
let
her
fit
herself
out
with
clothes
down
to
her
very
undergarments
yes
strange
as
it
may
seem
i
was
just
such
a
fool
i
had
entered
into
her
scheme
and
the
means
she
took
to
change
her
personality
only
amused
me
she
wished
to
present
herself
to
my
father
as
a
girl
obliged
to
work
for
her
living
and
was
too
shrewd
to
excite
suspicion
in
the
minds
of
any
of
the
family
by
any
undue
luxury
in
her
apparel
at
least
that
was
the
excuse
she
gave
me
for
the
precautions
she
took
though
i
think
the
delight
she
experienced
in
anything
romantic
and
unusual
had
as
much
to
do
with
it
as
anything
else
she
enjoyed
the
game
she
was
playing
and
wished
to
make
as
much
of
it
as
possible
were
her
own
garments
much
richer
than
those
she
ordered
from
altman
undoubtedly
van
burnam
wore
nothing
made
by
american
seamstresses
fine
clothes
were
her
weakness
i
see
i
see
but
why
such
an
attempt
on
your
part
to
keep
yourself
in
the
background
why
let
your
wife
write
your
assumed
names
in
the
hotel
register
for
instance
instead
of
doing
it
yourself
it
was
easier
for
her
i
know
no
other
reason
she
did
not
mind
putting
down
the
name
pope
i
did
it
was
an
ungracious
reflection
upon
his
wife
and
he
seemed
to
feel
it
so
for
he
almost
immediately
added
a
man
will
sometimes
lend
himself
to
a
scheme
of
which
the
details
are
obnoxious
it
was
so
in
this
case
but
she
was
too
interested
in
her
plans
to
be
affected
by
so
small
a
matter
as
this
this
explained
more
than
one
mysterious
action
on
the
part
of
this
pair
while
they
were
at
the
hotel
d
the
coroner
evidently
considered
it
in
this
light
for
he
dwelt
but
little
longer
on
this
phase
of
the
case
passing
at
once
to
a
fact
concerning
which
curiosity
had
hitherto
been
roused
without
receiving
any
satisfaction
in
leaving
the
hotel
said
he
you
and
your
wife
were
seen
carrying
certain
packages
which
were
missing
from
your
arms
when
you
alighted
at
van
burnam
house
what
was
in
those
packages
and
where
did
you
dispose
of
them
before
you
entered
the
second
carriage
howard
made
no
demur
in
answering
my
wife
clothes
were
in
them
said
he
and
we
dropped
them
somewhere
on
street
near
third
avenue
just
as
we
saw
an
old
woman
coming
along
the
sidewalk
we
knew
that
she
would
stop
and
pick
them
up
and
she
did
for
we
slid
into
a
dark
shadow
made
by
a
projecting
stoop
and
watched
her
is
that
too
simple
a
method
for
disposing
of
certain
encumbering
bundles
to
be
believed
sir
that
is
for
the
jury
to
decide
answered
the
coroner
stiffly
but
why
were
you
so
anxious
to
dispose
of
these
articles
were
they
not
worth
some
money
and
would
it
not
have
been
simpler
and
much
more
natural
to
have
left
them
at
the
hotel
till
you
chose
to
send
for
them
that
is
if
you
were
simply
engaged
in
playing
as
you
say
a
game
upon
your
father
and
not
upon
the
whole
community
yes
van
burnam
acknowledged
that
would
have
been
the
natural
thing
no
doubt
but
we
were
not
following
natural
instincts
at
the
time
but
a
woman
caprices
we
did
as
i
said
and
laughed
long
i
assure
you
over
its
unqualified
success
for
the
old
woman
not
only
grabbed
the
packages
with
avidity
but
turned
and
fled
away
with
them
just
as
if
she
had
expected
this
opportunity
and
had
prepared
herself
to
make
the
most
of
it
it
was
very
laughable
certainly
observed
the
coroner
in
a
hard
voice
must
have
found
it
very
ridiculous
and
after
giving
the
witness
a
look
full
of
something
deeper
than
sarcasm
he
turned
towards
the
jury
as
if
to
ask
them
what
they
thought
of
these
very
forced
and
suspicious
explanations
but
they
evidently
did
not
know
what
to
think
and
the
coroner
looks
flew
back
to
the
witness
who
of
all
the
persons
present
seemed
the
least
impressed
by
the
position
in
which
he
stood
van
burnam
said
he
you
showed
a
great
deal
of
feeling
this
morning
at
being
confronted
with
your
wife
hat
why
was
this
and
why
did
you
wait
till
you
saw
this
evidence
of
her
presence
on
the
scene
of
death
to
acknowledge
the
facts
you
have
been
good
enough
to
give
us
this
afternoon
if
i
had
a
lawyer
by
my
side
you
would
not
ask
me
that
question
or
if
you
did
i
would
not
be
allowed
to
answer
it
but
i
have
no
lawyer
here
and
so
i
will
say
that
i
was
greatly
shocked
by
the
catastrophe
which
had
happened
to
my
wife
and
under
the
stress
of
my
first
overpowering
emotions
had
the
impulse
to
hide
the
fact
that
the
victim
of
so
dreadful
a
mischance
was
my
wife
i
thought
that
if
no
connection
was
found
between
myself
and
this
dead
woman
i
would
stand
in
no
danger
of
the
suspicion
which
must
cling
to
the
man
who
came
into
the
house
with
her
but
like
most
first
impulses
it
was
a
foolish
one
and
gave
way
under
the
strain
of
investigation
i
however
persisted
in
it
as
long
as
possible
partially
because
my
disposition
is
an
obstinate
one
and
partially
because
i
hated
to
acknowledge
myself
a
fool
but
when
i
saw
the
hat
and
recognized
it
as
an
indisputable
proof
of
her
presence
in
the
van
burnam
house
that
night
my
confidence
in
the
attempt
i
was
making
broke
down
all
at
once
i
could
deny
her
shape
her
hands
and
even
the
scar
which
she
might
have
had
in
common
with
other
women
but
i
could
not
deny
her
hat
too
many
persons
had
seen
her
wear
it
but
the
coroner
was
not
to
be
so
readily
imposed
upon
i
see
i
see
he
repeated
with
great
dryness
and
i
hope
the
jury
will
be
satisfied
and
they
probably
will
unless
they
remember
the
anxiety
which
according
to
your
story
was
displayed
by
your
wife
to
have
her
whole
outfit
in
keeping
with
her
appearance
as
a
working
girl
if
she
was
so
particular
as
to
think
it
necessary
to
dress
herself
in
undergarments
why
make
all
these
precautions
void
by
carrying
into
the
house
a
hat
with
the
name
of
an
expensive
milliner
inside
it
women
are
inconsistent
sir
she
liked
the
hat
and
hated
to
part
with
it
she
thought
she
could
hide
it
somewhere
in
the
great
house
at
least
that
was
what
she
said
to
me
when
she
tucked
it
under
her
cape
the
coroner
who
evidently
did
not
believe
one
word
of
this
stared
at
the
witness
as
if
curiosity
was
fast
taking
the
place
of
indignation
and
i
did
not
wonder
howard
van
burnam
as
thus
presented
to
our
notice
by
his
own
testimony
was
an
anomaly
whether
we
were
to
believe
what
he
was
saying
at
the
present
time
or
what
he
had
said
during
the
morning
session
but
i
wished
i
had
had
the
questioning
of
him
his
next
answer
however
opened
up
one
dark
place
into
which
i
had
been
peering
for
some
time
without
any
enlightenment
it
was
in
reply
to
the
following
query
all
this
said
the
coroner
is
very
interesting
but
what
explanation
have
you
to
give
for
taking
your
wife
into
your
father
empty
house
at
an
hour
so
late
and
then
leaving
her
to
spend
the
best
part
of
the
dark
night
alone
none
said
he
that
will
strike
you
as
sensible
and
judicious
but
we
were
not
sensible
that
night
neither
were
we
judicious
or
i
would
not
be
standing
here
trying
to
explain
what
is
not
explainable
by
any
of
the
ordinary
rules
of
conduct
she
was
set
upon
being
the
first
to
greet
my
father
on
his
entrance
into
his
own
home
and
her
first
plan
had
been
to
do
so
in
her
own
proper
character
as
my
wife
but
afterwards
the
freak
took
her
as
i
have
said
to
personify
the
housekeeper
whom
my
father
had
cabled
us
to
have
in
waiting
at
his
house
a
cablegram
which
had
reached
us
too
late
for
any
practical
use
and
which
we
had
therefore
ignored
and
fearing
he
might
come
early
in
the
morning
before
she
could
be
on
hand
to
make
the
favorable
impression
she
intended
she
wished
to
be
left
in
the
house
that
night
and
i
humored
her
i
did
not
foresee
the
suffering
that
my
departure
might
cause
her
or
the
fears
that
were
likely
to
spring
from
her
lonely
position
in
so
large
and
empty
a
dwelling
or
rather
i
should
say
did
not
foresee
them
for
she
begged
me
not
to
stay
with
her
when
i
hinted
at
the
darkness
and
dreariness
of
the
place
saying
that
she
was
too
jolly
to
feel
fear
or
think
of
anything
but
the
surprise
my
father
and
sisters
would
experience
in
discovering
that
their
very
agreeable
young
housekeeper
was
the
woman
they
had
so
long
despised
and
why
persisted
the
coroner
edging
forward
in
his
interest
and
so
allowing
me
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
gryce
face
as
he
too
leaned
forward
in
his
anxiety
to
hear
every
word
that
fell
from
this
remarkable
witness
why
do
you
speak
of
her
fear
what
reason
have
you
to
think
she
suffered
apprehension
after
your
departure
why
echoed
the
witness
as
if
astounded
by
the
other
lack
of
perspicacity
did
she
not
kill
herself
in
a
moment
of
terror
and
discouragement
leaving
her
as
i
did
in
a
condition
of
health
and
good
spirits
can
you
expect
me
to
attribute
her
death
to
any
other
cause
than
a
sudden
attack
of
frenzy
caused
by
terror
ah
exclaimed
the
coroner
in
a
suspicious
tone
which
no
doubt
voiced
the
feelings
of
most
people
present
then
you
think
your
wife
committed
suicide
most
certainly
replied
the
witness
avoiding
but
two
pairs
of
eyes
in
the
whole
crowd
those
of
his
father
and
brother
a
continued
the
coroner
letting
his
hitherto
scarcely
suppressed
irony
become
fully
visible
in
voice
and
manner
thrust
into
the
back
of
her
neck
at
a
spot
young
ladies
surely
would
have
but
little
reason
to
know
is
peculiarly
fatal
suicide
when
she
was
found
crushed
under
a
pile
of
which
was
thrown
down
or
fell
upon
her
hours
after
she
received
the
fatal
thrust
i
do
not
know
how
else
she
could
have
died
persisted
the
witness
calmly
unless
she
opened
the
door
to
some
burglar
and
what
burglar
would
kill
a
woman
in
that
way
when
he
could
pound
her
with
his
fists
no
she
was
frenzied
and
stabbed
herself
in
desperation
or
the
thing
was
done
by
accident
god
knows
how
and
as
for
the
testimony
of
the
experts
we
all
know
how
easily
the
wisest
of
them
can
be
mistaken
even
in
matters
of
as
serious
import
as
these
all
the
experts
in
the
here
his
voice
rose
and
his
nostrils
dilated
till
his
aspect
was
actually
commanding
and
impressed
us
all
like
a
sudden
transformation
all
the
experts
in
the
world
were
to
swear
that
those
shelves
were
thrown
upon
her
after
she
had
lain
therefor
four
hours
dead
i
would
not
believe
them
appearances
or
no
appearances
blood
or
no
blood
i
here
declare
that
she
pulled
that
cabinet
over
in
her
and
upon
the
truth
of
this
fact
i
am
ready
to
rest
my
honor
as
a
man
and
my
integrity
as
her
an
uproar
immediately
followed
amid
which
could
be
heard
cries
of
he
lies
he
a
fool
the
attitude
taken
by
the
witness
was
so
unexpected
that
the
most
callous
person
present
could
not
fail
to
be
affected
by
it
but
curiosity
is
as
potent
a
passion
as
surprise
and
in
a
few
minutes
all
was
still
again
and
everybody
intent
to
hear
how
the
coroner
would
answer
these
asseverations
i
have
heard
of
a
blind
man
denying
the
existence
of
light
said
that
gentleman
but
never
before
of
a
sensible
being
like
yourself
urging
the
most
untenable
theories
in
face
of
such
evidence
as
has
been
brought
before
us
during
this
inquiry
if
your
wife
committed
suicide
or
if
the
entrance
of
the
point
of
a
into
her
spine
was
effected
by
accident
how
comes
the
head
of
the
pin
to
have
been
found
so
many
feet
away
from
her
and
in
such
a
place
as
the
parlor
register
it
may
have
flown
there
when
it
broke
or
what
is
much
more
probable
been
kicked
there
by
some
of
the
many
people
who
passed
in
and
out
of
the
room
between
the
time
of
her
death
and
that
of
its
discovery
but
the
register
was
found
closed
urged
the
coroner
was
it
not
mr
gryce
that
person
thus
appealed
to
rose
for
an
instant
it
was
said
he
and
deliberately
sat
down
again
the
face
of
the
witness
which
had
been
singularly
free
from
expression
since
his
last
vehement
outbreak
clouded
over
for
an
instant
and
his
eye
fell
as
if
he
felt
himself
engaged
in
an
unequal
struggle
but
he
recovered
his
courage
speedily
and
quietly
observed
the
register
may
have
been
closed
by
a
passing
foot
i
have
known
of
stranger
coincidences
than
that
van
burnam
asked
the
coroner
as
if
weary
of
subterfuges
and
argument
have
you
considered
the
effect
which
this
highly
contradictory
evidence
of
yours
is
likely
to
have
on
your
reputation
i
have
and
are
you
ready
to
accept
the
consequences
if
any
especial
consequences
follow
i
must
accept
them
sir
when
did
you
lose
the
keys
which
you
say
you
have
not
now
in
your
possession
this
morning
you
asserted
that
you
did
not
know
but
perhaps
this
afternoon
you
may
like
to
modify
that
statement
i
lost
them
after
i
left
my
wife
shut
up
in
my
father
house
soon
very
soon
how
soon
within
an
hour
i
should
judge
how
do
you
know
it
was
so
soon
i
missed
them
at
once
where
were
you
when
you
missed
them
i
do
know
somewhere
i
was
walking
the
streets
as
i
have
said
i
do
remember
just
where
i
was
when
i
thrust
my
hands
into
my
pocket
and
found
the
keys
gone
you
do
not
no
but
it
was
within
an
hour
after
leaving
the
house
yes
very
good
the
keys
have
been
found
the
witness
started
started
so
violently
that
his
teeth
came
together
with
a
click
loud
enough
to
be
heard
over
the
whole
room
have
they
said
he
with
an
effort
at
nonchalance
which
however
failed
to
deceive
any
one
who
noticed
his
change
of
color
can
tell
me
then
where
i
lost
them
they
were
found
said
the
coroner
in
their
usual
place
above
your
brother
desk
in
duane
street
oh
murmured
the
witness
utterly
taken
aback
or
appearing
so
i
can
not
account
for
their
being
found
in
the
office
i
was
so
sure
i
dropped
them
in
the
street
i
did
not
think
you
could
account
for
it
quietly
observed
the
coroner
and
without
another
word
he
dismissed
the
witness
who
staggered
to
a
seat
as
remote
as
possible
from
the
one
where
he
had
previously
been
sitting
between
his
father
and
brother
xv
a
reluctant
witness
a
pause
of
decided
duration
now
followed
an
exasperating
pause
which
tried
even
me
much
as
i
pride
myself
upon
my
patience
there
seemed
to
be
some
hitch
in
regard
to
the
next
witness
the
coroner
sent
gryce
into
the
neighboring
room
more
than
once
and
finally
when
the
general
uneasiness
seemed
on
the
point
of
expressing
itself
by
a
loud
murmur
a
gentleman
stepped
forth
whose
appearance
instead
of
allaying
the
excitement
renewed
it
in
quite
an
unprecedented
and
remarkable
way
i
did
not
know
the
person
thus
introduced
he
was
a
handsome
man
a
very
handsome
man
if
the
truth
must
be
told
but
it
did
not
seem
to
be
this
fact
which
made
half
the
people
there
crane
their
heads
to
catch
a
glimpse
of
him
something
else
something
entirely
disconnected
with
his
appearance
there
as
a
witness
appeared
to
hold
the
people
enthralled
and
waken
a
subdued
enthusiasm
which
showed
itself
not
only
in
smiles
but
in
whispers
and
significant
nudges
chiefly
among
the
women
though
i
noticed
that
the
jurymen
stared
when
somebody
obliged
them
with
the
name
of
this
new
witness
at
last
it
reached
my
ears
and
though
it
awakened
in
me
also
a
decided
curiosity
i
restrained
all
expression
of
it
being
unwilling
to
add
one
jot
to
this
ridiculous
display
of
human
weakness
randolph
stone
as
the
intended
husband
of
the
rich
miss
althorpe
was
a
figure
of
some
importance
in
the
city
and
while
i
was
very
glad
of
this
opportunity
of
seeing
him
i
did
not
propose
to
lose
my
head
or
forget
in
the
marked
interest
his
person
invoked
the
very
serious
cause
which
had
brought
him
before
us
and
yet
i
suppose
no
one
in
the
room
observed
his
figure
more
minutely
he
was
elegantly
made
and
possessed
as
i
have
said
a
face
of
peculiar
beauty
but
these
were
not
his
only
claims
to
admiration
he
was
a
man
of
undoubted
intelligence
and
great
distinction
of
manner
the
intelligence
did
not
surprise
me
knowing
as
i
did
how
he
had
raised
himself
to
his
present
enviable
position
in
society
in
the
short
space
of
five
years
but
the
perfection
of
his
manner
astonished
me
though
how
i
could
have
expected
anything
less
in
a
man
honored
by
miss
althorpe
regard
i
can
not
say
he
had
that
clear
pallor
of
complexion
which
in
a
face
is
so
impressive
and
his
voice
when
he
spoke
had
that
music
in
it
which
only
comes
from
great
cultivation
and
a
deliberate
intent
to
please
he
was
a
friend
of
howard
that
i
saw
by
the
short
look
that
passed
between
them
when
he
first
entered
the
room
but
that
it
was
not
as
a
friend
he
stood
there
was
apparent
from
the
state
of
amazement
with
which
the
former
recognized
him
as
well
as
from
the
regret
to
be
seen
underlying
the
polished
manner
of
the
witness
himself
though
perfectly
and
perfectly
respectful
he
showed
by
every
means
possible
the
pain
he
felt
in
adding
one
to
the
evidence
against
a
man
with
whom
he
was
on
terms
of
more
or
less
intimacy
but
let
me
give
his
testimony
having
acknowledged
that
he
knew
the
van
burnam
family
well
and
howard
in
particular
he
went
on
to
state
that
on
the
night
of
the
seventeenth
he
had
been
detained
at
his
office
by
business
of
a
more
than
usual
pressing
nature
and
finding
that
he
could
expect
no
rest
for
that
night
humored
himself
by
getting
off
the
cars
at
street
instead
of
proceeding
on
to
street
where
his
apartments
were
the
smile
which
these
words
caused
miss
althorpe
lives
in
street
woke
no
corresponding
light
on
his
face
indeed
he
frowned
at
it
as
if
he
felt
that
the
gravity
of
the
situation
admitted
of
nothing
frivolous
or
humorsome
and
this
feeling
was
shared
by
howard
for
he
started
when
the
witness
mentioned
street
and
cast
him
a
haggard
look
of
dismay
which
happily
no
one
saw
but
myself
for
every
one
else
was
concerned
with
the
witness
or
should
i
except
gryce
i
had
of
course
no
intentions
beyond
a
short
stroll
through
this
street
previous
to
returning
to
my
home
continued
the
witness
gravely
and
am
sorry
to
be
obliged
to
mention
this
freak
of
mine
but
find
it
necessary
in
order
to
account
for
my
presence
there
at
so
unusual
an
hour
you
need
make
no
apologies
returned
the
coroner
will
you
state
on
what
line
of
cars
you
came
from
your
office
i
came
up
third
avenue
ah
and
walked
towards
broadway
yes
so
that
you
necessarily
passed
very
near
the
van
burnam
mansion
yes
at
what
time
was
this
can
you
say
at
four
or
nearly
four
it
was
three
when
i
left
my
office
was
it
light
at
that
hour
could
you
distinguish
objects
readily
i
had
no
difficulty
in
seeing
and
what
did
you
see
anything
amiss
at
the
van
burnam
mansion
no
sir
nothing
amiss
i
merely
saw
howard
van
burnam
coming
down
the
stoop
as
i
went
by
the
corner
you
made
no
mistake
it
was
the
gentleman
you
name
and
no
other
whom
you
saw
on
this
stoop
at
this
hour
i
am
very
sure
that
it
was
he
i
am
sorry
but
the
coroner
gave
him
no
opportunity
to
finish
you
and
van
burnam
are
friends
you
say
and
it
was
light
enough
for
you
to
recognize
each
other
then
you
probably
spoke
no
we
did
not
i
was
thinking
well
of
other
things
and
here
he
allowed
the
ghost
of
a
smile
to
flit
suggestively
across
his
lips
and
van
burnam
seemed
preoccupied
also
for
as
far
as
i
know
he
did
not
even
look
my
way
and
you
did
not
stop
no
he
did
not
look
like
a
man
to
be
disturbed
and
this
was
at
four
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
at
four
you
are
certain
of
the
hour
and
of
the
day
i
am
certain
i
should
not
be
standing
here
if
i
were
not
very
sure
of
my
memory
i
am
sorry
he
began
again
but
he
was
stopped
as
peremptorily
as
before
by
the
coroner
feeling
has
no
place
in
an
inquiry
like
this
and
the
witness
was
dismissed
stone
who
had
manifestly
given
his
evidence
under
compulsion
looked
relieved
at
its
termination
as
he
passed
back
to
the
room
from
which
he
had
come
many
only
noticed
the
extreme
elegance
of
his
form
and
the
proud
cast
of
his
head
but
i
saw
more
than
these
i
saw
the
look
of
regret
he
cast
at
his
friend
howard
a
painful
silence
followed
his
withdrawal
then
the
coroner
spoke
to
the
jury
gentlemen
i
leave
you
to
judge
of
the
importance
of
this
testimony
stone
is
a
man
of
unquestionable
integrity
but
perhaps
van
burnam
can
explain
how
he
came
to
visit
his
father
house
at
four
in
the
morning
on
that
memorable
night
when
according
to
his
latest
testimony
he
left
his
wife
there
at
twelve
we
will
give
him
the
opportunity
there
is
no
use
began
the
young
man
from
the
place
where
he
sat
but
gathering
courage
even
while
speaking
he
came
rapidly
forward
and
facing
coroner
and
jury
once
more
said
with
a
false
kind
of
energy
that
imposed
upon
no
one
i
can
explain
this
fact
but
i
doubt
if
you
will
accept
my
explanation
i
was
at
my
father
house
at
that
hour
but
not
in
it
my
restlessness
drove
me
back
to
my
wife
but
not
finding
the
keys
in
my
pocket
i
came
down
the
stoop
again
and
went
away
ah
i
see
now
why
you
prevaricated
this
morning
in
regard
to
the
time
when
you
missed
those
keys
i
know
that
my
testimony
is
full
of
contradictions
you
feared
to
have
it
known
that
you
were
on
the
stoop
of
your
house
for
the
second
time
that
night
naturally
in
face
of
the
suspicion
i
perceived
everywhere
about
me
and
this
time
you
did
not
go
in
no
nor
ring
the
bell
no
why
not
if
you
left
your
wife
within
alive
and
well
i
did
not
wish
to
disturb
her
my
purpose
was
not
strong
enough
to
surmount
the
least
difficulty
i
was
easily
deterred
from
going
where
i
had
little
wish
to
be
so
that
you
merely
went
up
the
stoop
and
down
again
at
the
time
stone
saw
you
yes
and
if
he
had
passed
a
minute
sooner
he
would
have
seen
this
seen
me
go
up
i
mean
as
well
as
seen
me
come
down
i
did
not
linger
long
in
the
doorway
but
you
did
linger
there
a
moment
yes
long
enough
to
hunt
for
the
keys
and
get
over
my
astonishment
at
not
finding
them
did
you
notice
stone
going
by
on
street
no
was
it
as
light
as
stone
has
said
yes
it
was
light
and
you
did
not
notice
him
no
yet
you
must
have
followed
very
closely
behind
him
not
necessarily
i
went
by
the
way
of
twentieth
street
sir
why
i
do
not
know
for
my
rooms
are
uptown
i
do
not
know
why
i
did
half
the
things
i
did
that
night
i
can
readily
believe
it
remarked
the
coroner
van
burnam
indignation
rose
you
are
trying
said
he
to
connect
me
with
the
fearful
death
of
my
wife
in
my
father
lonely
house
you
can
not
do
it
for
i
am
as
innocent
of
that
death
as
you
are
or
any
other
person
in
this
assemblage
nor
did
i
pull
those
shelves
down
upon
her
as
you
would
have
this
jury
think
in
my
last
thoughtless
visit
to
my
father
door
she
died
according
to
god
will
by
her
own
hand
or
by
means
of
some
strange
and
unaccountable
accident
known
only
to
him
and
so
you
will
find
if
justice
has
any
place
in
these
investigations
and
a
manly
intelligence
be
allowed
to
take
the
place
of
prejudice
in
the
breasts
of
the
twelve
men
now
sitting
before
me
and
bowing
to
the
coroner
he
waited
for
his
dismissal
and
receiving
it
walked
back
not
to
his
lonely
corner
but
to
his
former
place
between
his
father
and
brother
who
received
him
with
a
wistful
air
and
strange
looks
of
mingled
hope
and
disbelief
the
jury
will
render
their
verdict
on
monday
morning
announced
the
coroner
and
adjourned
the
inquiry
the
windings
of
a
labyrinth
xvi
cogitations
my
cook
had
prepared
for
me
a
most
excellent
dinner
thinking
that
i
needed
all
the
comfort
possible
after
a
day
of
such
trying
experiences
but
i
ate
little
of
it
my
thoughts
were
too
busy
my
mind
too
much
exercised
what
would
be
the
verdict
of
the
jury
and
could
this
especial
jury
be
relied
upon
to
give
a
just
verdict
at
seven
i
had
left
the
table
and
was
shut
up
in
my
own
room
i
could
not
rest
till
i
had
fathomed
my
own
mind
in
regard
to
the
events
of
the
day
the
question
the
great
question
of
course
now
was
how
much
of
howard
testimony
was
to
be
believed
and
whether
he
was
notwithstanding
his
asseverations
to
the
contrary
the
murderer
of
his
wife
to
most
persons
the
answer
seemed
easy
from
the
expression
of
such
people
as
i
had
jostled
in
leaving
the
i
judged
that
his
sentence
had
already
been
passed
in
the
minds
of
most
there
present
but
these
hasty
judgments
did
not
influence
me
i
hope
i
look
deeper
than
the
surface
and
my
mind
would
not
subscribe
to
his
guilt
notwithstanding
the
bad
impression
made
upon
me
by
his
falsehoods
and
contradictions
now
why
would
not
my
mind
subscribe
to
it
had
sentiment
got
the
better
of
me
amelia
butterworth
and
was
i
no
longer
capable
of
looking
a
thing
squarely
in
the
face
had
the
van
burnams
of
all
people
in
the
world
awakened
my
sympathies
at
the
cost
of
my
good
sense
and
was
i
disposed
to
see
virtue
in
a
man
in
whom
every
circumstance
as
it
came
to
light
revealed
little
but
folly
and
weakness
the
lies
he
had
told
for
there
is
no
other
word
to
describe
his
contradictions
would
have
been
sufficient
under
most
circumstances
to
condemn
a
man
in
my
estimation
why
then
did
i
secretly
look
for
excuses
to
his
conduct
probing
the
matter
to
the
bottom
i
reasoned
in
this
way
the
latter
half
of
his
evidence
was
a
complete
contradiction
of
the
first
purposely
so
in
the
first
he
made
himself
out
a
egotist
with
not
enough
interest
in
his
wife
to
make
an
effort
to
determine
whether
she
and
the
murdered
woman
were
identical
in
the
latter
he
showed
himself
in
the
light
of
a
man
influenced
to
the
point
of
folly
by
a
woman
to
whom
he
had
been
utterly
unyielding
a
few
hours
before
now
knowing
human
nature
to
be
full
of
contradictions
i
could
not
satisfy
myself
that
i
should
be
justified
in
accepting
either
half
of
his
testimony
as
absolutely
true
the
man
who
is
all
firmness
one
minute
may
be
all
weakness
the
next
and
in
face
of
the
calm
assertions
made
by
this
one
when
driven
to
bay
by
the
unexpected
discoveries
of
the
police
i
dared
not
decide
that
his
final
assurances
were
altogether
false
and
that
he
was
not
the
man
i
had
seen
enter
the
adjoining
house
with
his
wife
why
then
not
carry
the
conclusion
farther
and
admit
as
reason
and
probability
suggested
that
he
was
also
her
murderer
that
he
had
killed
her
during
his
first
visit
and
drawn
the
shelves
down
upon
her
in
the
second
would
not
this
account
for
all
the
phenomena
to
be
observed
in
connection
with
this
otherwise
unexplainable
affair
certainly
all
but
one
one
that
was
perhaps
known
to
nobody
but
myself
and
that
was
the
testimony
given
by
the
clock
said
that
the
shelves
fell
at
five
whereas
according
to
stone
evidence
it
was
four
or
thereabouts
when
van
burnam
left
his
father
house
but
the
clock
might
not
have
been
a
reliable
witness
it
might
have
been
set
wrong
or
it
might
not
have
been
running
at
all
at
the
time
of
the
accident
no
it
would
not
do
for
me
to
rely
too
much
upon
anything
so
doubtful
nor
did
i
yet
i
could
not
rid
myself
of
the
conviction
that
howard
spoke
the
truth
when
he
declared
in
face
of
coroner
and
jury
that
they
could
not
connect
him
with
this
crime
and
whether
this
conclusion
sprang
from
sentimentality
or
intuition
i
was
resolved
to
stick
to
it
for
the
present
night
at
least
the
morrow
might
show
its
futility
but
the
morrow
had
not
come
meanwhile
with
this
theory
accepted
what
explanation
could
be
given
of
the
very
peculiar
facts
surrounding
this
woman
death
could
the
supposition
of
suicide
advanced
by
howard
before
the
coroner
be
entertained
for
a
moment
or
that
equally
improbable
suggestion
of
accident
going
to
my
bureau
drawer
i
drew
out
the
old
which
has
already
figured
in
these
pages
and
the
notes
i
had
scribbled
on
its
back
early
in
the
history
of
this
affair
they
related
if
you
will
remember
to
this
very
question
and
seemed
even
now
to
answer
it
in
a
more
or
less
convincing
way
will
you
pardon
me
if
i
transcribe
these
notes
again
as
i
can
not
imagine
my
first
deliberations
on
this
subject
to
have
made
a
deep
enough
impression
for
you
to
recall
them
without
help
from
me
the
question
raised
in
these
notes
was
threefold
and
the
answers
as
you
will
recollect
were
transcribed
before
the
cause
of
death
had
been
determined
by
the
discovery
of
the
broken
pin
in
the
dead
woman
brain
these
are
the
queries
first
was
her
death
due
to
accident
second
was
it
effected
by
her
own
hand
third
was
it
a
murder
the
replies
given
are
in
the
form
of
reasons
as
witness
reasons
for
not
thinking
it
an
if
it
had
been
an
accident
and
she
had
pulled
the
cabinet
over
upon
herself
b
she
would
have
been
found
with
her
feet
pointing
towards
the
wall
where
the
cabinet
had
stood
but
her
feet
were
towards
the
door
and
her
head
under
the
cabinet
the
precise
arrangement
of
the
clothing
about
her
feet
which
precluded
any
theory
involving
accident
reason
for
not
thinking
it
a
she
could
not
have
been
found
in
the
position
observed
without
having
lain
down
on
the
floor
while
living
and
then
pulled
the
shelves
down
upon
herself
a
theory
obviously
too
improbable
to
be
considered
reason
for
not
thinking
it
she
would
need
to
have
been
held
down
on
the
floor
while
the
cabinet
was
being
pulled
over
on
her
a
thing
which
the
quiet
aspect
of
the
hands
and
feet
make
appear
impossible
very
good
but
we
know
now
that
she
was
dead
when
the
shelves
fell
over
so
that
my
one
excuse
for
not
thinking
it
a
murder
is
rendered
null
reasons
for
thinking
it
a
but
i
will
not
repeat
these
my
reasons
for
not
thinking
it
an
accident
or
a
suicide
remained
as
good
as
when
they
were
written
and
if
her
death
had
not
been
due
to
either
of
these
causes
then
it
must
have
been
due
to
some
murderous
hand
was
that
hand
the
hand
of
her
husband
i
have
already
given
it
as
my
opinion
that
it
was
not
now
how
to
make
that
opinion
good
and
reconcile
me
again
to
myself
for
i
am
not
accustomed
to
have
my
instincts
at
war
with
my
judgment
is
there
any
reason
for
my
thinking
as
i
do
yes
the
manliness
of
man
he
only
looked
well
when
he
was
repelling
the
suspicion
he
saw
in
the
surrounding
faces
but
that
might
have
been
assumed
just
as
his
careless
manner
was
assumed
during
the
early
part
of
the
inquiry
i
must
have
some
stronger
reason
than
this
for
my
belief
the
two
hats
well
he
had
explained
how
there
came
to
be
two
hats
on
the
scene
of
crime
but
his
explanation
had
not
been
very
satisfactory
had
seen
no
hat
in
her
hand
when
she
crossed
the
pavement
to
her
father
house
but
then
she
might
have
carried
it
under
her
cape
without
my
seeing
it
perhaps
the
discovery
of
two
hats
and
of
two
pairs
of
gloves
in
van
burnam
parlors
was
a
fact
worth
further
investigation
and
mentally
i
made
a
note
of
it
though
at
the
moment
i
saw
no
prospect
of
engaging
in
this
matter
further
than
my
duties
as
a
witness
required
and
now
what
other
clue
was
offered
me
save
the
one
i
have
already
mentioned
as
being
given
by
the
clock
none
that
i
could
seize
upon
and
feeling
the
weakness
of
the
cause
i
had
so
obstinately
embraced
i
rose
from
my
seat
at
the
and
began
making
such
alterations
in
my
toilet
as
would
prepare
me
for
the
evening
and
my
inevitable
callers
amelia
said
i
to
myself
as
i
encountered
my
anything
but
satisfied
reflection
in
the
glass
can
it
be
that
you
ought
after
all
to
have
been
called
araminta
is
a
momentary
display
of
spirit
on
the
part
of
a
young
man
of
doubtful
principles
enough
to
make
you
forget
the
dictates
of
good
sense
which
have
always
governed
you
up
to
this
time
the
stern
image
which
confronted
me
from
the
mirror
made
me
no
reply
and
smitten
with
sudden
disgust
i
left
the
glass
and
went
below
to
greet
some
friends
who
had
just
ridden
up
in
their
carriage
they
remained
one
hour
and
they
discussed
one
subject
howard
van
burnam
and
his
probable
connection
with
the
crime
which
had
taken
place
next
door
but
though
i
talked
some
and
listened
more
as
is
proper
for
a
woman
in
her
own
house
i
said
nothing
and
heard
nothing
which
had
not
been
already
said
and
heard
in
numberless
homes
that
night
whatever
thoughts
i
had
which
in
any
way
differed
from
those
generally
expressed
i
kept
to
myself
whether
guided
by
discretion
or
pride
i
can
not
say
probably
by
both
for
i
am
not
deficient
in
either
quality
arrangements
had
already
been
made
for
the
burial
of
van
burnam
that
night
and
as
the
funeral
ceremony
was
to
take
place
next
door
many
of
my
guests
came
just
to
sit
in
my
windows
and
watch
the
coming
and
going
of
the
few
people
invited
to
the
ceremony
but
i
discouraged
this
i
have
no
patience
with
idle
curiosity
consequently
by
nine
i
was
left
alone
to
give
the
affair
such
real
attention
as
it
demanded
something
which
of
course
i
could
not
have
done
with
a
half
dozen
gossiping
friends
leaning
over
my
shoulder
footnotes
footnote
b
was
asserted
by
her
husband
in
his
sworn
xvii
butterworth
versus
gryce
the
result
of
this
attention
can
be
best
learned
from
the
conversation
i
held
with
gryce
the
next
morning
he
came
earlier
than
usual
but
he
found
me
up
and
stirring
well
he
cried
accosting
me
with
a
smile
as
i
entered
the
parlor
where
he
was
seated
it
is
all
right
this
time
is
it
not
no
trouble
in
identifying
the
gentleman
who
entered
your
neighbor
house
last
night
at
a
quarter
to
twelve
resolved
to
probe
this
man
mind
to
the
bottom
i
put
on
my
sternest
air
i
had
not
expected
any
one
to
enter
there
so
late
last
night
said
i
van
burnam
declared
so
positively
at
the
inquest
that
he
was
the
person
we
have
been
endeavoring
to
identify
that
i
did
not
suppose
you
would
consider
it
necessary
to
bring
him
to
the
house
for
me
to
see
and
so
you
were
not
in
the
window
i
did
not
say
that
i
am
always
where
i
have
promised
to
be
mr
gryce
well
then
he
inquired
sharply
i
was
purposely
slow
in
answering
him
i
had
all
the
longer
time
to
search
his
face
but
its
calmness
was
impenetrable
and
finally
i
declared
the
man
you
brought
with
you
last
night
you
were
the
person
who
accompanied
him
were
you
not
was
the
man
i
saw
alight
there
four
nights
ago
he
may
have
expected
it
it
may
have
been
the
very
assertion
he
desired
from
me
but
his
manner
showed
displeasure
and
the
quick
how
he
uttered
was
sharp
and
peremptory
i
do
not
ask
who
it
was
i
went
on
with
a
quiet
wave
of
my
hand
that
immediately
restored
him
to
himself
for
i
know
you
will
not
tell
me
but
what
i
do
hope
to
know
is
the
name
of
the
man
who
entered
that
same
house
at
just
ten
minutes
after
nine
he
was
one
of
the
funeral
guests
and
he
arrived
in
a
carriage
that
was
immediately
preceded
by
a
coach
from
which
four
persons
alighted
two
ladies
and
two
gentlemen
i
do
not
know
the
gentleman
was
the
detective
and
retort
i
did
not
keep
track
of
every
guest
that
attended
the
funeral
then
you
did
do
your
work
as
well
as
i
did
mine
was
my
rather
dry
reply
for
i
noted
every
one
who
went
in
and
that
gentleman
whoever
he
was
was
more
like
the
person
i
have
been
trying
to
identify
than
any
one
i
have
seen
enter
there
during
my
four
midnight
vigils
gryce
smiled
uttered
a
short
and
looked
more
than
ever
like
a
sphinx
i
began
quietly
to
hate
him
under
my
calm
exterior
was
howard
at
his
wife
funeral
i
asked
he
was
and
did
he
come
in
a
carriage
he
did
alone
he
thought
he
was
alone
yes
then
may
it
not
have
been
he
i
ca
say
gryce
was
so
obviously
out
of
his
element
under
this
that
i
could
not
suppress
a
smile
even
while
i
experienced
a
very
lively
indignation
at
his
reticence
he
may
have
seen
me
smile
and
he
may
not
for
his
eyes
as
i
have
intimated
were
always
busy
with
some
object
entirely
removed
from
the
person
he
addressed
but
at
all
events
he
rose
leaving
me
no
alternative
but
to
do
the
same
and
so
you
did
recognize
the
gentleman
i
brought
to
the
neighboring
house
just
before
twelve
he
quietly
remarked
with
a
calm
ignoring
of
my
last
question
which
was
a
trifle
exasperating
no
then
he
declared
with
a
quick
change
of
manner
meant
i
should
judge
to
put
me
in
my
proper
place
i
do
not
think
we
can
depend
upon
the
accuracy
of
your
memory
and
he
made
a
motion
as
if
to
leave
as
i
did
not
know
whether
his
apparent
disappointment
was
real
or
not
i
let
him
move
to
the
door
without
a
reply
but
once
there
i
stopped
him
gryce
said
i
i
do
know
what
you
think
about
this
matter
nor
whether
you
even
wish
my
opinion
upon
it
but
i
am
going
to
express
it
for
all
that
do
not
believe
that
howard
killed
his
wife
with
a
no
retorted
the
old
gentleman
peering
into
his
hat
with
an
ironical
smile
which
that
inoffensive
article
of
attire
had
certainly
not
merited
and
why
miss
butterworth
why
you
must
have
substantial
reasons
for
any
opinion
you
would
form
i
have
an
intuition
i
responded
backed
by
certain
reasons
the
intuition
wo
impress
you
very
deeply
but
the
reasons
may
not
be
without
some
weight
and
i
am
going
to
confide
them
to
you
do
he
entreated
in
a
jocose
manner
which
struck
me
as
inappropriate
but
which
i
was
willing
to
overlook
on
account
of
his
age
and
very
fatherly
manner
well
then
said
i
this
is
one
if
the
crime
was
a
premeditated
one
if
he
hated
his
wife
and
felt
it
for
his
interest
to
have
her
out
of
the
way
a
man
of
van
burnam
good
sense
would
have
chosen
any
other
spot
than
his
father
house
to
kill
her
in
knowing
that
her
identity
could
not
be
hidden
if
once
she
was
associated
with
the
van
burnam
name
if
on
the
contrary
he
took
her
there
in
good
faith
and
her
death
was
the
unexpected
result
of
a
quarrel
between
them
then
the
means
employed
would
have
been
simpler
an
angry
man
does
not
stop
to
perform
a
delicate
surgical
operation
when
moved
to
the
point
of
murder
but
uses
his
hands
or
his
fists
just
as
van
burnam
himself
suggested
humph
grunted
the
detective
staring
very
hard
indeed
into
his
hat
you
must
not
think
me
this
young
man
friend
i
went
on
with
a
well
meant
desire
to
impress
him
with
the
impartiality
of
my
attitude
i
never
have
spoken
to
him
nor
he
to
me
but
i
am
the
friend
of
justice
and
i
must
declare
that
there
was
a
note
of
surprise
in
the
emotion
he
showed
at
sight
of
his
wife
hat
that
was
far
too
natural
to
be
assumed
the
detective
failed
to
be
impressed
i
might
have
expected
this
knowing
his
sex
and
the
reliance
such
a
man
is
apt
to
place
upon
his
own
powers
acting
acting
was
his
laconic
comment
a
very
uncommon
character
that
of
howard
van
burnam
i
do
not
think
you
do
it
full
justice
perhaps
not
but
see
that
you
do
slight
mine
i
do
not
expect
you
to
heed
these
suggestions
any
more
than
you
did
those
i
offered
you
in
connection
with
boppert
the
but
my
conscience
is
eased
by
my
communication
and
that
is
much
to
a
solitary
woman
like
myself
who
is
obliged
to
spend
many
a
long
hour
alone
with
no
other
companion
something
has
been
accomplished
then
by
this
delay
he
observed
then
as
if
ashamed
of
this
momentary
display
of
irritation
he
added
in
the
genial
tones
more
natural
to
him
i
do
blame
you
for
your
good
opinion
of
this
interesting
but
by
no
means
reliable
young
man
miss
butterworth
a
woman
kind
heart
stands
in
the
way
of
her
proper
judgment
of
criminals
you
will
not
find
its
instincts
fail
even
if
you
do
its
judgment
his
bow
was
as
full
of
politeness
as
it
was
lacking
in
conviction
i
hope
you
wo
let
your
instincts
lead
you
into
any
unnecessary
detective
work
he
quietly
suggested
that
i
can
not
promise
if
you
arrest
howard
van
burnam
for
murder
i
may
be
tempted
to
meddle
with
matters
which
do
concern
me
an
amused
smile
broke
through
his
simulated
seriousness
pray
accept
my
congratulations
then
in
advance
my
health
has
been
such
that
i
have
long
anticipated
giving
up
my
profession
but
if
i
am
to
have
such
assistants
as
you
in
my
work
i
shall
be
inclined
to
remain
in
it
some
time
longer
when
a
man
as
busy
as
you
stops
to
indulge
in
sarcasm
he
is
in
more
or
less
good
spirits
such
a
condition
i
am
told
only
prevails
with
detectives
when
they
have
come
to
a
positive
conclusion
concerning
the
case
they
are
engaged
upon
i
see
you
already
understand
the
members
of
your
future
profession
as
much
as
is
necessary
at
this
juncture
i
retorted
then
seeing
him
about
to
repeat
his
bow
i
added
sharply
you
need
not
trouble
yourself
to
show
me
too
much
politeness
if
i
meddle
in
this
matter
at
all
it
will
not
be
as
your
coadjutor
but
as
your
rival
my
rival
yes
your
rival
and
rivals
are
never
good
friends
until
one
of
them
is
hopelessly
defeated
miss
butterworth
i
see
myself
already
at
your
feet
and
with
this
sally
and
a
short
chuckle
which
did
more
than
anything
he
had
said
towards
settling
me
in
my
determination
to
do
as
i
had
threatened
he
opened
the
door
and
quietly
disappeared
xviii
the
little
pincushion
the
verdict
rendered
by
the
coroner
jury
showed
it
to
be
a
more
discriminating
set
of
men
than
i
had
calculated
upon
it
was
murder
inflicted
by
a
hand
unknown
i
was
so
gratified
by
this
that
i
left
the
in
quite
an
agitated
frame
of
mind
so
agitated
indeed
that
i
walked
through
one
door
instead
of
another
and
thus
came
unexpectedly
upon
a
group
formed
almost
exclusively
of
the
van
burnam
family
starting
back
for
i
dislike
anything
that
looks
like
intrusion
especially
when
no
great
end
is
to
be
gained
by
it
i
was
about
to
retrace
my
steps
when
i
felt
two
soft
arms
about
my
neck
oh
miss
butterworth
is
it
a
mercy
that
this
dreadful
thing
is
over
i
do
know
when
i
have
ever
felt
anything
so
keenly
it
was
isabella
van
burnam
startled
for
the
embraces
bestowed
on
me
are
few
i
gave
a
subdued
sort
of
grunt
which
nevertheless
did
not
displease
this
young
lady
for
her
arms
tightened
and
she
murmured
in
my
ear
you
dear
old
soul
i
like
you
much
we
are
going
to
be
very
good
neighbors
cooed
a
still
sweeter
voice
in
my
other
ear
papa
says
we
must
call
on
you
soon
and
demure
face
looked
around
into
mine
in
a
manner
some
would
have
thought
exceedingly
bewitching
thank
you
pretty
poppets
i
returned
freeing
myself
as
speedily
as
possible
from
embraces
the
sincerity
of
which
i
felt
open
to
question
my
house
is
always
open
to
you
and
with
little
ceremony
i
walked
steadily
out
and
betook
myself
to
the
carriage
awaiting
me
i
looked
upon
this
display
of
feeling
as
the
mere
gush
of
two
young
women
and
was
therefore
somewhat
astonished
when
i
was
interrupted
in
my
afternoon
nap
by
an
announcement
that
the
two
misses
van
burnam
awaited
me
in
the
parlor
going
down
i
saw
them
standing
there
hand
in
hand
and
both
as
white
as
a
sheet
o
miss
butterworth
they
cried
springing
towards
me
howard
has
been
arrested
and
we
have
no
one
to
say
a
word
of
comfort
to
us
arrested
i
repeated
greatly
surprised
for
i
had
not
expected
it
to
happen
so
soon
if
it
happened
at
all
yes
and
father
is
just
about
prostrated
franklin
too
but
he
keeps
up
while
father
has
shut
himself
into
his
room
and
wo
see
anybody
not
even
us
o
i
do
know
how
we
are
to
bear
it
such
a
disgrace
and
such
a
wicked
wicked
shame
for
howard
never
had
anything
to
do
with
his
wife
death
had
he
miss
butterworth
no
i
returned
taking
my
ground
at
once
and
vigorously
for
i
really
believed
what
i
said
he
is
innocent
of
her
death
and
i
would
like
the
chance
of
proving
it
they
evidently
had
not
expected
such
an
unqualified
assertion
from
me
for
they
almost
smothered
me
with
kisses
and
called
me
only
and
indeed
showed
so
much
real
feeling
this
time
that
i
neither
pushed
them
away
nor
tried
to
withdraw
myself
from
their
embraces
when
their
emotions
were
a
little
exhausted
i
led
them
to
a
sofa
and
sat
down
before
them
they
were
motherless
girls
and
my
heart
if
hard
is
not
made
of
adamant
or
entirely
unsusceptible
to
the
calls
of
pity
and
friendship
girls
said
i
if
you
will
be
calm
i
should
like
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
ask
us
anything
returned
isabella
nobody
has
more
right
to
our
confidence
than
you
this
was
another
of
their
exaggerated
expressions
but
i
was
so
anxious
to
hear
what
they
had
to
tell
i
let
it
pass
so
instead
of
rebuking
them
i
asked
where
their
brother
had
been
arrested
and
found
it
had
been
at
his
rooms
and
in
presence
of
themselves
and
franklin
so
i
inquired
further
and
learned
that
so
far
as
they
knew
nothing
had
been
discovered
beyond
what
had
come
out
at
the
inquest
except
that
trunks
had
been
found
packed
as
if
he
had
been
making
preparations
for
a
journey
when
interrupted
by
the
dreadful
event
which
had
put
him
into
the
hands
of
the
police
as
there
was
a
certain
significance
in
this
the
girls
seemed
almost
as
much
impressed
by
it
as
i
was
but
we
did
not
discuss
it
long
for
i
suddenly
changed
my
manner
and
taking
them
both
by
the
hand
asked
if
they
could
keep
a
secret
secret
they
gasped
yes
a
secret
you
are
not
the
girls
i
should
confide
in
ordinarily
but
this
trouble
has
sobered
you
o
we
can
do
anything
began
isabella
and
only
try
us
murmured
caroline
but
knowing
the
volubility
of
the
one
and
the
weakness
of
the
other
i
shook
my
head
at
their
promises
and
merely
tried
to
impress
them
with
the
fact
that
their
brother
safety
depended
upon
their
discretion
at
which
they
looked
very
determined
for
poppets
and
squeezed
my
hands
so
tightly
that
i
wished
i
had
left
off
some
of
my
rings
before
engaging
in
this
interview
when
they
were
quiet
again
and
ready
to
listen
i
told
them
my
plans
they
were
surprised
of
course
and
wondered
how
i
could
do
anything
towards
finding
out
the
real
murderer
of
their
but
seeing
how
resolved
i
looked
changed
their
tone
and
avowed
with
much
feeling
their
perfect
confidence
in
me
and
in
the
success
of
anything
i
might
undertake
this
was
encouraging
and
ignoring
their
momentary
distrust
i
proceeded
to
say
but
for
me
to
be
successful
in
this
matter
no
one
must
know
my
interest
in
it
you
must
pay
me
no
visits
give
me
no
confidences
nor
if
you
can
help
it
mention
my
name
before
not
even
before
your
father
and
brother
so
much
for
precautionary
measures
my
dears
and
now
for
the
active
ones
i
have
no
curiosity
as
i
think
you
must
see
but
i
shall
have
to
ask
you
a
few
questions
which
under
other
circumstances
would
savor
more
or
less
of
impertinence
had
your
any
special
admirers
among
the
other
sex
oh
protested
caroline
shrinking
back
while
isabella
eyes
grew
round
as
a
frightened
child
none
that
we
ever
heard
of
she
that
kind
of
a
woman
was
she
belle
it
was
for
any
such
reason
papa
did
like
her
no
no
would
have
been
too
dreadful
it
was
her
family
we
objected
to
that
all
well
well
i
apologized
tapping
their
hands
reassuringly
i
only
asked
let
me
now
say
from
curiosity
though
i
have
not
a
particle
of
that
quality
i
assure
you
did
you
think
did
you
have
any
idea
faltered
caroline
that
never
mind
i
interrupted
you
must
let
my
words
go
in
one
ear
and
out
of
the
other
after
you
have
answered
them
i
wish
here
i
assumed
a
brisk
air
that
i
could
go
through
your
parlors
again
before
every
trace
of
the
crime
perpetrated
there
has
been
removed
why
you
can
replied
isabella
there
is
no
one
in
them
now
added
caroline
franklin
went
out
just
before
we
left
at
which
i
blandly
rose
and
following
their
leadership
soon
found
myself
once
again
in
the
van
burnam
mansion
my
first
glance
upon
the
parlors
was
naturally
directed
towards
the
spot
where
the
tragedy
had
taken
place
the
cabinet
had
been
replaced
and
the
shelves
set
back
upon
it
but
the
latter
were
empty
and
neither
on
them
nor
on
the
adjacent
did
i
see
the
clock
this
set
me
thinking
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
have
another
look
at
that
clock
by
dint
of
judicious
questions
i
found
that
it
had
been
carried
into
the
third
room
where
we
soon
found
it
lying
on
a
shelf
of
the
same
closet
where
the
hat
had
been
discovered
by
gryce
franklin
had
put
it
there
fearing
that
the
sight
of
it
might
affect
howard
and
from
the
fact
that
the
hands
stood
as
i
had
left
them
i
gathered
that
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
family
had
discovered
that
it
was
in
running
condition
assured
of
this
i
astonished
them
by
requesting
to
have
it
taken
down
and
set
up
on
the
table
which
they
had
no
sooner
done
than
it
started
to
tick
just
as
it
had
done
under
my
hand
a
few
nights
before
the
girls
greatly
startled
surveyed
each
other
wonderingly
why
it
going
cried
caroline
who
could
have
wound
it
marvelled
isabella
hark
i
cried
the
clock
had
begun
to
strike
it
gave
forth
five
clear
notes
well
it
a
mystery
isabella
exclaimed
then
seeing
no
astonishment
in
my
face
she
added
did
you
know
about
this
miss
butterworth
my
dear
girls
i
hastened
to
say
with
all
the
impressiveness
characteristic
of
me
in
my
more
serious
moments
i
do
not
expect
you
to
ask
me
for
any
information
i
do
not
volunteer
this
is
hard
i
know
but
some
day
i
will
be
perfectly
frank
with
you
are
you
willing
to
accept
my
aid
on
these
terms
o
yes
they
gasped
but
they
looked
not
a
little
disappointed
and
now
said
i
leave
the
clock
where
it
is
and
when
your
brother
comes
home
show
it
to
him
and
say
that
having
the
curiosity
to
examine
it
you
were
surprised
to
find
it
going
and
that
you
had
left
it
there
for
him
to
see
he
will
be
surprised
also
and
as
a
consequence
will
question
first
you
and
then
the
police
to
find
out
who
wound
it
if
they
acknowledge
having
done
it
you
must
notify
me
at
once
for
that
what
i
want
to
know
do
you
understand
caroline
and
isabella
do
you
feel
that
you
can
go
through
all
this
without
dropping
a
word
concerning
me
and
my
interest
in
this
matter
of
course
they
answered
yes
and
of
course
it
was
with
so
much
effusiveness
that
i
was
obliged
to
remind
them
that
they
must
keep
a
check
on
their
enthusiasm
and
also
to
suggest
that
they
should
not
come
to
my
house
or
send
me
any
notes
but
simply
a
blank
card
signifying
no
one
knows
who
wound
the
clock
how
delightfully
mysterious
cried
isabella
and
with
this
girlish
exclamation
our
talk
in
regard
to
the
clock
closed
the
next
object
that
attracted
our
attention
was
a
novel
i
discovered
on
a
in
the
same
room
whose
is
this
i
asked
not
mine
not
mine
yet
it
was
published
this
summer
i
remarked
they
stared
at
me
astonished
and
isabella
caught
up
the
book
it
was
one
of
those
summer
publications
intended
mainly
for
railroad
distribution
and
while
neither
ragged
nor
soiled
bore
evidence
of
having
been
read
let
me
take
it
said
isabella
at
once
passed
it
into
my
hands
does
your
brother
smoke
i
asked
which
brother
either
of
them
franklin
sometimes
but
howard
never
it
disagrees
with
him
i
believe
there
is
a
faint
odor
of
tobacco
about
these
pages
can
it
have
been
brought
here
by
franklin
o
no
he
never
reads
novels
not
such
novels
as
this
at
all
events
he
loses
a
lot
of
pleasure
we
think
i
turned
the
pages
over
the
latter
ones
were
so
fresh
i
could
almost
put
my
finger
on
the
spot
where
the
reader
had
left
off
feeling
like
a
bloodhound
who
has
just
run
upon
a
trail
i
returned
the
book
to
caroline
with
the
injunction
to
put
it
away
adding
as
i
saw
her
air
of
hesitation
if
your
brother
franklin
misses
it
it
will
show
that
he
brought
it
here
and
then
i
shall
have
no
further
interest
in
it
which
seemed
to
satisfy
her
for
she
put
it
away
at
once
on
a
high
shelf
perceiving
nothing
else
in
these
rooms
of
a
suggestive
character
i
led
the
way
into
the
hall
there
i
had
a
new
idea
which
of
you
was
the
first
to
go
through
the
rooms
upstairs
i
inquired
both
of
us
answered
isabella
we
came
together
why
do
you
ask
miss
butterworth
i
was
wondering
if
you
found
everything
in
order
there
we
did
not
notice
anything
wrong
did
we
caroline
do
you
think
that
the
the
person
who
committed
that
awful
crime
went
i
could
sleep
a
wink
if
i
thought
so
nor
i
caroline
put
in
o
do
say
that
he
went
miss
butterworth
i
do
not
know
it
i
rejoined
but
you
asked
and
i
ask
again
was
there
some
little
thing
out
of
its
usual
place
i
was
up
in
your
front
chamber
after
water
for
a
minute
but
i
did
touch
anything
but
the
mug
we
missed
the
mug
but
o
caroline
the
do
you
suppose
miss
butterworth
means
the
i
started
did
she
refer
to
the
one
i
had
picked
up
from
the
floor
and
placed
on
a
what
about
the
i
asked
o
nothing
but
we
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
its
being
on
the
table
you
see
we
had
a
little
shaped
like
a
tomato
which
always
hung
at
the
side
of
our
bureau
it
was
tied
to
one
of
the
brackets
and
was
never
taken
off
caroline
having
a
fancy
for
it
because
it
kept
her
favorite
black
pins
out
of
the
reach
of
the
neighbor
children
when
they
came
here
well
this
cushion
this
sacred
cushion
which
none
of
us
dared
touch
was
found
by
us
on
a
little
table
by
the
door
with
the
ribbon
hanging
from
it
by
which
it
had
been
tied
to
the
bureau
some
one
had
pulled
it
off
and
very
roughly
too
for
the
ribbon
was
all
ragged
and
torn
but
there
is
nothing
in
a
little
thing
like
that
to
interest
you
is
there
miss
butterworth
no
said
i
not
relating
my
part
in
the
affair
not
if
our
children
were
the
marauders
but
none
of
them
came
in
for
days
before
we
left
are
there
pins
in
the
cushion
when
we
found
it
do
you
mean
no
i
did
not
remember
seeing
any
but
one
can
not
always
trust
to
memory
but
you
had
left
pins
in
it
possibly
i
do
remember
why
should
i
remember
such
a
thing
as
that
i
thought
to
myself
i
would
know
whether
i
left
pins
on
my
or
not
but
every
one
is
not
as
methodical
as
i
am
more
the
pity
have
you
anywhere
about
you
a
pin
like
those
you
keep
on
that
cushion
i
inquired
of
caroline
she
felt
at
her
belt
and
neck
and
shook
her
head
i
may
have
upstairs
she
replied
then
get
me
one
but
before
she
could
start
i
pulled
her
back
did
either
of
you
sleep
in
that
room
last
night
no
we
were
going
to
answered
isabella
but
afterwards
caroline
took
a
freak
to
sleep
in
one
of
the
rooms
on
the
third
floor
she
said
she
wanted
to
get
away
from
the
parlors
as
far
as
possible
then
i
should
like
a
peep
at
the
one
overhead
the
wrenching
of
the
from
its
place
had
given
me
an
idea
they
looked
at
me
wistfully
as
they
turned
to
mount
the
stairs
but
i
did
not
enlighten
them
further
what
would
an
idea
be
worth
shared
by
them
their
father
undoubtedly
lay
in
the
back
room
for
they
moved
very
softly
around
the
head
of
the
stairs
but
once
in
front
they
let
their
tongues
run
loose
again
i
who
cared
nothing
for
their
babble
when
it
contained
no
information
walked
slowly
about
the
room
and
finally
stopped
before
the
bed
it
had
a
fresh
look
and
i
at
once
asked
them
if
it
had
been
lately
made
up
they
assured
me
that
it
had
not
saying
that
they
always
kept
their
beds
spread
during
their
absence
as
they
did
so
hate
to
enter
a
room
disfigured
by
bare
mattresses
i
could
have
read
them
a
lecture
on
the
niceties
of
housekeeping
but
i
refrained
instead
of
that
i
pointed
to
a
little
dent
in
the
smooth
surface
of
the
bed
nearest
the
door
did
either
of
you
two
make
that
i
asked
they
shook
their
heads
in
amazement
what
is
there
in
that
began
caroline
but
i
motioned
her
to
bring
me
the
little
cushion
which
she
no
sooner
did
than
i
laid
it
in
the
little
dent
which
it
fitted
to
a
nicety
you
wonderful
old
thing
exclaimed
caroline
how
ever
did
you
think
but
i
stopped
her
enthusiasm
with
a
look
i
may
be
wonderful
but
i
am
not
old
and
it
is
time
they
knew
it
is
said
i
and
lifting
the
cushion
i
placed
it
on
a
perfectly
smooth
portion
of
the
bed
now
take
it
up
said
i
when
lo
a
second
dent
similar
to
the
first
you
see
where
that
cushion
has
lain
before
being
placed
on
the
table
i
remarked
and
reminding
caroline
of
the
pin
i
wanted
i
took
my
leave
and
returned
to
my
own
house
leaving
behind
me
two
girls
as
much
filled
with
astonishment
as
the
giddiness
of
their
pates
would
allow
xix
a
decided
step
forward
i
felt
that
i
had
made
an
advance
it
was
a
small
one
no
doubt
but
it
was
an
advance
it
would
not
do
to
rest
there
however
or
to
draw
definite
conclusions
from
what
i
had
seen
without
further
facts
to
guide
me
boppert
could
supply
these
facts
or
so
i
believed
accordingly
i
decided
to
visit
boppert
not
knowing
whether
gryce
had
thought
it
best
to
put
a
watch
over
my
movements
but
taking
it
for
granted
that
it
would
be
like
him
to
do
so
i
made
a
couple
of
formal
calls
on
the
avenue
before
i
started
eastward
i
had
learned
boppert
address
before
leaving
home
but
i
did
not
ride
directly
to
the
tenement
where
she
lived
i
chose
instead
to
get
out
at
a
little
fancy
store
i
saw
in
the
neighborhood
it
was
a
curious
place
i
never
saw
so
many
or
such
variety
of
things
in
one
small
spot
in
my
life
but
i
did
not
waste
any
time
upon
this
quaint
interior
but
stepped
immediately
up
to
the
good
woman
i
saw
leaning
over
the
counter
do
you
know
a
boppert
who
lives
at
i
asked
the
woman
look
was
too
quick
and
suspicious
for
denial
but
she
was
about
to
attempt
it
when
i
cut
her
short
by
saying
i
wish
to
see
boppert
very
much
but
not
in
her
own
rooms
i
will
pay
any
one
well
who
will
assist
me
to
five
minutes
conversation
with
her
in
such
a
place
say
as
that
i
see
behind
the
glass
door
at
the
end
of
this
very
shop
the
woman
startled
by
so
unexpected
a
proposition
drew
back
a
step
and
was
about
to
shake
her
head
when
i
laid
on
the
counter
before
her
shall
i
say
how
much
yes
for
it
was
not
thrown
away
a
bill
which
she
no
sooner
saw
than
she
gave
a
gasp
of
delight
will
you
give
me
she
cried
for
answer
i
pushed
it
towards
her
but
before
her
fingers
could
clutch
it
i
resolutely
said
boppert
must
not
know
there
is
anybody
waiting
here
to
see
her
or
she
will
not
come
i
have
no
towards
her
and
mean
her
only
good
but
she
a
timid
sort
of
person
and
i
know
she
timid
broke
in
the
good
woman
eagerly
and
she
had
enough
to
make
her
so
what
with
policemen
drumming
her
up
at
night
and
girls
and
boys
luring
her
into
corners
to
tell
them
what
she
saw
in
that
grand
house
where
the
murder
took
place
grown
that
feared
of
her
shadow
you
can
hardly
get
her
out
after
sundown
but
i
think
i
can
get
her
here
and
if
you
mean
her
no
harm
why
her
fingers
were
on
the
bill
and
charmed
with
the
feel
of
it
she
forgot
to
finish
her
sentence
is
there
any
one
in
the
room
back
there
i
asked
anxious
to
recall
her
to
herself
no
no
one
at
all
i
am
a
poor
widder
and
not
used
to
such
company
as
you
but
if
you
will
sit
down
i
will
make
myself
look
more
fit
and
have
boppert
over
here
in
a
minute
and
calling
to
some
one
of
the
name
of
susie
to
look
after
the
shop
she
led
the
way
towards
the
glass
door
i
have
mentioned
relieved
to
find
everything
working
so
smoothly
and
determined
to
get
the
worth
of
my
money
out
of
boppert
when
i
saw
her
i
followed
the
woman
into
the
most
crowded
room
i
ever
entered
the
shop
was
nothing
to
it
there
you
could
move
without
hitting
anything
here
you
could
not
there
were
tables
against
every
wall
and
chairs
where
there
were
no
tables
opposite
me
was
a
filled
with
flowering
plants
and
at
my
right
a
grate
and
covered
that
is
the
latter
with
innumerable
small
articles
which
had
evidently
passed
a
long
and
forlorn
probation
on
the
shop
shelves
before
being
brought
in
here
while
i
was
looking
at
them
and
marvelling
at
the
small
quantity
of
dust
i
found
the
woman
herself
disappeared
behind
a
stack
of
boxes
for
which
there
was
undoubtedly
no
room
in
the
shop
could
she
have
gone
for
boppert
already
or
had
she
slipped
into
another
room
to
hide
the
money
which
had
come
so
unexpectedly
into
her
hands
i
was
not
long
left
in
doubt
for
in
another
moment
she
returned
with
a
cap
on
her
smooth
gray
head
that
transformed
her
into
a
figure
at
once
so
complacent
and
so
ridiculous
that
had
my
nerves
not
been
made
of
iron
i
should
certainly
have
betrayed
my
amusement
with
it
she
had
also
put
on
her
company
manner
and
what
with
the
smiles
she
bestowed
upon
me
and
her
perfect
satisfaction
with
her
own
appearance
i
had
all
i
could
do
to
hold
my
own
and
keep
her
to
the
matter
in
hand
finally
she
managed
to
take
in
my
anxiety
and
her
own
duty
and
saying
that
boppert
could
never
refuse
a
cup
of
tea
offered
to
send
her
an
invitation
to
supper
as
this
struck
me
favorably
i
nodded
at
which
she
cocked
her
head
on
one
side
and
insinuatingly
whispered
and
would
you
pay
for
the
tea
i
uttered
an
indignant
no
which
seemed
to
surprise
her
immediately
becoming
humble
again
she
replied
it
was
no
matter
that
she
had
tea
enough
and
that
the
shop
would
supply
cakes
and
crackers
to
all
of
which
i
responded
with
a
look
which
awed
her
so
completely
that
she
almost
dropped
the
dishes
with
which
she
was
endeavoring
to
set
one
of
the
tables
she
does
so
hate
to
talk
about
the
murder
that
it
will
be
a
perfect
godsend
to
her
to
drop
into
good
company
like
this
with
no
prying
neighbors
about
shall
i
set
a
chair
for
you
i
declined
the
honor
saying
that
i
would
remain
seated
where
i
was
adding
as
i
saw
her
about
to
go
let
her
walk
straight
in
and
she
will
be
in
the
middle
of
the
room
before
she
sees
me
that
will
suit
her
and
me
too
for
after
she
has
once
seen
me
she
wo
be
frightened
you
are
not
to
listen
at
the
this
i
said
with
great
severity
for
i
saw
the
woman
was
becoming
very
curious
and
having
said
it
i
waved
her
peremptorily
away
she
did
like
it
but
a
thought
of
the
five
dollars
comforted
her
casting
one
final
look
at
the
table
which
was
far
from
uninvitingly
set
she
slipped
out
and
i
was
left
to
contemplate
the
dozen
or
so
photographs
that
covered
the
walls
i
found
them
so
atrocious
and
their
arrangement
so
distracting
to
my
bump
of
order
which
is
of
a
pronounced
character
that
i
finally
shut
my
eyes
on
the
whole
scene
and
in
this
attitude
began
to
piece
my
thoughts
together
but
before
i
had
proceeded
far
steps
were
heard
in
the
shop
and
the
next
moment
the
door
flew
open
and
in
popped
boppert
with
a
face
like
a
peony
in
full
blossom
she
stopped
when
she
saw
me
and
stared
why
if
it
is
the
lady
hush
shut
the
door
i
have
something
very
particular
to
say
to
you
o
she
began
looking
as
if
she
wanted
to
back
out
but
i
was
too
quick
for
her
i
shut
the
door
myself
and
taking
her
by
the
arm
seated
her
in
the
corner
you
do
show
much
gratitude
i
remarked
i
did
not
know
what
she
had
to
be
grateful
to
me
for
but
she
had
so
plainly
intimated
at
our
first
interview
that
she
regarded
me
as
having
done
her
some
favor
that
i
was
disposed
to
make
what
use
of
it
i
could
to
gain
her
confidence
i
know
but
if
you
could
see
how
i
been
harried
the
murder
and
nothing
but
the
murder
all
the
time
and
it
was
to
get
away
from
the
talk
about
it
that
i
came
here
and
now
it
you
i
see
and
you
be
talking
about
it
too
or
why
be
in
such
a
place
as
this
and
what
if
i
do
talk
about
it
you
know
i
your
friend
or
i
never
would
have
done
you
that
good
turn
the
morning
we
came
upon
the
poor
girl
body
i
know
and
grateful
i
am
for
it
too
but
i
never
understood
it
was
it
to
save
me
from
being
blamed
by
the
wicked
police
or
was
it
a
dream
you
had
and
the
gentleman
had
for
i
heard
what
he
said
at
the
inquest
and
it
muddled
my
head
till
i
do
know
where
i
standing
what
i
had
said
and
what
the
gentleman
had
said
what
did
the
poor
thing
mean
as
i
did
not
dare
to
show
my
ignorance
i
merely
shook
my
head
never
mind
what
caused
us
to
speak
as
we
did
as
long
as
we
helped
and
we
did
help
you
the
police
never
found
out
what
you
had
to
do
with
this
woman
death
did
they
no
o
no
when
such
a
respectable
lady
as
you
said
that
you
saw
the
young
lady
come
into
the
house
in
the
middle
of
the
night
how
was
they
to
disbelieve
it
they
never
asked
me
if
i
knew
any
different
no
said
i
almost
struck
dumb
by
my
success
but
letting
no
hint
of
my
complacency
escape
me
and
i
did
not
mean
they
should
you
are
a
decent
woman
boppert
and
should
not
be
troubled
thank
you
but
how
did
you
know
she
had
come
to
the
house
before
i
left
did
you
see
her
i
hate
a
lie
as
i
do
poison
but
i
had
to
exercise
all
my
christian
principles
not
to
tell
one
then
no
said
i
i
did
see
her
but
i
do
always
have
to
use
my
eyes
to
know
what
is
going
on
in
my
neighbor
houses
which
is
true
enough
if
it
is
somewhat
humiliating
to
confess
it
o
how
smart
you
are
i
wish
i
had
some
smartness
in
me
but
my
husband
had
all
that
he
was
a
man
o
what
that
nothing
but
the
i
knocked
it
over
with
my
elbow
how
i
do
jump
at
everything
i
afraid
of
my
own
shadow
ever
since
i
saw
that
poor
thing
lying
under
that
heap
of
crockery
i
do
wonder
she
must
have
pulled
those
things
over
herself
do
you
think
so
no
one
went
in
there
to
murder
her
but
how
came
she
to
have
those
clothes
on
she
was
dressed
quite
different
when
i
let
her
in
i
say
it
all
a
muddle
and
it
will
be
a
smart
man
as
can
explain
it
or
a
smart
woman
i
thought
did
i
do
wrong
that
what
plagues
me
she
begged
so
hard
to
come
in
i
did
know
how
to
shut
the
door
on
her
besides
her
name
was
van
burnam
or
so
she
told
me
here
was
a
coil
subduing
my
surprise
i
remarked
if
she
asked
you
to
let
her
in
i
do
not
see
how
you
could
refuse
her
was
it
in
the
morning
or
late
in
the
afternoon
she
came
do
you
know
i
thought
you
knew
all
about
it
from
the
way
you
talked
had
i
been
indiscreet
could
she
not
bear
questioning
eying
her
with
some
severity
i
declared
in
a
less
familiar
tone
than
any
i
had
yet
used
nobody
knows
more
about
it
than
i
do
but
i
do
not
know
just
the
hour
at
which
this
lady
came
to
the
house
but
i
do
not
ask
you
to
tell
me
if
you
do
not
want
to
o
she
humbly
remonstrated
i
am
sure
i
am
willing
to
tell
you
everything
it
was
in
the
afternoon
while
i
was
doing
the
front
basement
floor
and
she
came
to
the
basement
door
yes
and
asked
to
be
let
in
yes
young
van
burnam
yes
dressed
in
a
black
and
white
plaid
silk
and
wearing
a
hat
covered
with
flowers
yes
or
something
like
that
i
know
it
was
very
bright
and
becoming
and
why
did
she
come
to
the
basement
door
a
lady
dressed
like
that
because
she
knew
i
could
open
the
front
door
that
i
had
the
key
o
she
talked
beautiful
and
was
proud
with
me
a
bit
she
made
me
let
her
stay
in
the
house
and
when
i
said
it
would
be
dark
after
a
while
and
that
i
had
done
nothing
to
the
rooms
upstairs
she
laughed
and
said
she
did
care
that
she
was
afraid
of
the
dark
and
had
just
as
lieve
as
not
stay
in
the
big
house
alone
all
night
for
she
had
a
book
did
you
say
anything
no
no
go
on
she
had
a
book
which
she
could
read
till
she
got
sleepy
i
never
thought
anything
would
happen
to
her
of
course
not
why
should
you
and
so
you
let
her
into
the
house
and
left
her
there
when
you
went
out
of
it
well
i
do
wonder
you
were
shocked
to
see
her
lying
dead
on
the
floor
next
morning
awful
i
was
afraid
they
would
blame
me
for
what
had
happened
but
i
did
do
nothing
to
make
her
die
i
only
let
her
stay
in
the
house
do
you
think
they
will
do
anything
to
me
if
they
know
it
no
said
i
trying
to
understand
this
woman
ignorant
fears
they
do
punish
such
things
more
the
pity
this
in
confidence
to
myself
how
could
you
know
that
a
piece
of
furniture
would
fall
on
her
before
morning
did
you
lock
her
in
when
you
left
the
house
yes
she
told
me
to
then
she
was
a
prisoner
confounded
by
the
mystery
of
the
whole
affair
i
sat
so
still
the
woman
looked
up
in
wonder
and
i
saw
i
had
better
continue
my
questions
what
reason
did
she
give
for
wanting
to
stay
in
the
house
all
night
what
reason
i
do
know
something
about
her
having
to
be
there
when
van
burnam
came
home
i
did
make
it
out
and
i
try
to
i
was
too
busy
wondering
what
she
would
have
to
eat
and
what
did
she
have
i
do
know
she
said
she
had
something
but
i
did
see
it
perhaps
you
were
blinded
by
the
money
she
gave
you
she
gave
you
some
of
course
o
not
much
not
much
and
i
would
have
taken
a
cent
if
it
had
not
seemed
to
make
her
so
happy
to
give
it
the
pretty
pretty
thing
a
real
lady
whatever
they
say
about
her
and
happy
you
said
she
was
happy
and
pretty
o
yes
did
know
what
was
going
to
happen
i
even
heard
her
sing
after
she
went
i
wished
that
my
ears
had
been
attending
to
their
duty
that
day
and
i
might
have
heard
her
sing
too
but
the
walls
between
my
house
and
that
of
the
van
burnams
are
very
thick
as
i
have
had
occasion
to
observe
more
than
once
then
she
went
before
you
left
to
be
sure
what
would
she
do
in
the
kitchen
and
you
did
see
her
again
no
but
i
heard
her
walking
around
in
the
parlors
you
mean
yes
in
the
parlors
you
did
not
go
up
yourself
no
i
had
enough
to
do
below
did
you
go
up
when
you
went
away
no
i
did
like
to
when
did
you
go
at
five
i
always
go
at
five
how
did
you
know
it
was
five
the
kitchen
clock
told
me
i
wound
it
and
set
it
when
the
whistles
blew
at
twelve
was
that
the
only
clock
you
wound
only
clock
do
you
think
i
be
going
around
the
house
winding
any
others
her
face
showed
such
surprise
and
her
eyes
met
mine
so
frankly
that
i
was
convinced
she
spoke
the
truth
gratified
i
do
know
why
i
bestowed
upon
her
my
first
smile
which
seemed
to
affect
her
for
her
face
softened
and
she
looked
at
me
quite
eagerly
for
a
minute
before
she
said
you
do
think
so
very
bad
of
me
do
you
but
i
had
been
struck
by
a
thought
which
made
me
for
the
moment
oblivious
to
her
question
had
wound
the
clock
in
the
kitchen
for
her
own
uses
and
why
may
not
the
lady
above
have
wound
the
one
in
the
parlor
for
hers
filled
with
this
startling
idea
i
remarked
the
young
lady
wore
a
watch
of
course
but
the
suggestion
passed
unheeded
boppert
was
as
much
absorbed
in
her
own
thoughts
as
i
was
did
young
van
burnam
wear
a
watch
i
persisted
boppert
face
remained
a
blank
provoked
at
her
impassibility
i
shook
her
with
an
angry
hand
imperatively
demanding
what
are
you
thinking
of
why
do
you
answer
my
questions
she
was
herself
again
in
an
instant
o
i
beg
your
pardon
i
was
wondering
if
you
meant
the
parlor
clock
i
calmed
myself
looked
severe
to
hide
my
more
than
eager
interest
and
sharply
cried
of
course
i
mean
the
parlor
clock
did
you
wind
it
o
no
no
no
i
would
as
soon
think
of
touching
gold
or
silver
but
the
young
lady
did
i
sure
for
i
heard
it
strike
when
she
was
setting
of
it
ah
if
my
nature
had
not
been
an
undemonstrative
one
and
if
i
had
not
been
bred
to
a
strong
sense
of
social
distinctions
i
might
have
betrayed
my
satisfaction
at
this
announcement
in
a
way
that
would
have
made
this
homely
german
woman
start
as
it
was
i
sat
and
even
made
her
think
i
had
not
heard
her
venturing
to
rouse
a
bit
she
spoke
again
after
a
minute
silence
she
might
have
been
lonely
you
know
and
the
ticking
of
a
clock
is
such
company
yes
i
answered
with
more
than
my
accustomed
vivacity
for
she
jumped
as
if
i
had
struck
her
you
have
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
boppert
and
are
a
much
smarter
woman
than
i
thought
but
when
did
she
wind
the
clock
at
five
just
before
i
left
the
house
o
and
did
she
know
you
were
going
i
think
so
for
i
called
up
just
before
i
put
on
my
bonnet
that
it
was
five
and
that
i
was
going
o
you
did
and
did
she
answer
back
yes
i
heard
her
step
in
the
hall
and
then
her
voice
she
asked
if
i
was
sure
it
was
five
and
i
told
her
yes
because
i
had
set
the
kitchen
clock
at
twelve
she
did
say
any
more
but
just
after
that
i
heard
the
parlor
clock
begin
to
strike
o
thought
i
what
can
not
be
got
out
of
the
most
stupid
and
unwilling
witness
by
patience
and
a
judicious
use
of
questions
to
know
that
this
clock
was
started
after
five
that
is
after
the
hour
at
which
the
hands
pointed
when
it
fell
and
that
it
was
set
correctly
in
starting
and
so
would
give
indisputable
testimony
of
the
hour
when
the
shelves
fell
were
points
of
the
greatest
importance
i
was
so
pleased
i
gave
the
woman
another
smile
instantly
she
cried
but
you
wo
say
anything
about
it
will
you
they
might
make
me
pay
for
all
the
things
that
were
broke
my
smile
this
time
was
not
one
of
encouragement
simply
but
it
might
have
been
anything
for
all
effect
it
had
on
her
the
intricacies
of
the
affair
had
disturbed
her
poor
brain
again
and
all
her
powers
of
mind
were
given
up
to
lament
o
she
bemoaned
i
wish
i
had
never
seen
her
my
head
would
ache
so
with
the
muddle
of
it
why
her
husband
said
he
came
to
the
house
at
midnight
with
his
wife
how
could
he
when
she
was
inside
of
it
all
the
time
but
then
perhaps
he
said
that
just
as
you
did
to
save
me
blame
but
why
should
a
gentleman
like
him
do
that
it
is
worth
while
for
you
to
bother
your
head
about
it
i
expostulated
it
is
enough
that
head
aches
over
it
i
do
suppose
she
understood
me
or
tried
to
her
wits
had
been
sorely
tried
and
my
rather
severe
questioning
had
not
tended
to
clear
them
at
all
events
she
went
on
in
another
moment
as
if
i
had
not
spoken
but
what
became
of
her
pretty
dress
i
was
never
so
astonished
in
my
life
as
when
i
saw
that
dark
skirt
on
her
she
might
have
left
her
fine
gown
upstairs
i
ventured
not
wishing
to
go
into
the
niceties
of
evidence
with
this
woman
so
she
might
so
she
might
and
that
may
have
been
her
petticoat
we
saw
but
in
another
moment
she
saw
the
impossibility
of
this
for
she
added
but
i
saw
her
petticoat
and
it
was
a
brown
silk
one
she
showed
it
when
she
lifted
her
skirt
to
get
at
her
purse
i
do
understand
it
as
her
face
by
this
time
was
almost
purple
i
thought
it
a
mercy
to
close
the
interview
so
i
uttered
some
few
words
of
a
soothing
and
encouraging
nature
and
then
seeing
that
something
more
tangible
was
necessary
to
restore
her
to
any
proper
condition
of
spirits
i
took
out
my
and
bestowed
on
her
some
of
my
loose
silver
this
was
something
she
understand
she
brightened
immediately
and
before
she
was
well
through
her
expressions
of
delight
i
had
quitted
the
room
and
in
a
few
minutes
later
the
shop
i
hope
the
two
women
had
their
cup
of
tea
after
that
xx
miss
butterworth
theory
i
was
so
excited
when
i
entered
my
carriage
that
i
rode
all
the
way
home
with
my
bonnet
askew
and
never
knew
it
when
i
reached
my
room
and
saw
myself
in
the
glass
i
was
shocked
and
stole
a
glance
at
lena
who
was
setting
out
my
little
to
see
if
she
noticed
what
a
ridiculous
figure
i
cut
but
she
is
discretion
itself
and
for
a
girl
with
two
undeniable
dimples
in
her
cheeks
smiles
seldom
at
least
when
i
am
looking
at
her
she
was
not
smiling
now
and
though
for
the
reason
given
above
this
was
not
as
comforting
as
it
may
appear
i
chose
not
to
worry
myself
any
longer
about
such
a
trifle
when
i
had
matters
of
so
much
importance
on
my
mind
taking
off
my
bonnet
whose
rakish
appearance
had
given
me
such
a
shock
i
sat
down
and
for
half
an
hour
neither
moved
nor
spoke
i
was
thinking
a
theory
which
had
faintly
suggested
itself
to
me
at
the
inquest
was
taking
on
body
with
these
later
developments
two
hats
had
been
found
on
the
scene
of
the
tragedy
and
two
pairs
of
gloves
and
now
i
had
learned
that
there
had
been
two
women
there
the
one
whom
boppert
had
locked
into
the
house
on
leaving
it
and
the
one
whom
i
had
seen
enter
at
midnight
with
van
burnam
which
of
the
two
had
perished
we
had
been
led
to
think
and
van
burnam
had
himself
acknowledged
that
it
was
his
wife
but
his
wife
had
been
dressed
quite
differently
from
the
murdered
woman
and
was
as
i
soon
began
to
see
much
more
likely
to
have
been
the
assassin
than
the
victim
would
you
like
to
know
my
reasons
for
this
extraordinary
statement
if
so
they
are
these
i
had
always
seen
a
woman
hand
in
this
work
but
having
no
reason
to
believe
in
the
presence
of
any
other
woman
on
the
scene
of
crime
than
the
victim
i
had
put
this
suspicion
aside
as
untenable
but
now
that
i
had
found
the
second
woman
i
returned
to
it
but
how
connect
her
with
the
murder
it
seemed
easy
enough
to
do
so
if
this
other
woman
was
her
rival
we
have
heard
of
no
rival
but
she
may
have
known
of
one
and
this
knowledge
may
have
been
at
the
bottom
of
her
disagreement
with
her
husband
and
the
determination
she
evinced
to
win
his
family
over
to
her
side
let
us
say
then
that
the
second
woman
was
van
burnam
rival
that
he
brought
her
there
not
knowing
that
his
wife
had
effected
an
entrance
into
the
house
brought
her
there
after
an
afternoon
spent
at
the
hotel
d
during
which
he
had
furnished
her
with
a
new
outfit
of
less
pronounced
type
perhaps
than
that
she
had
previously
worn
the
use
of
the
two
carriages
and
the
care
they
took
to
throw
suspicion
off
their
track
may
have
been
part
of
a
scheme
of
future
elopement
for
i
had
no
idea
they
meant
to
remain
in
van
burnam
house
for
what
purpose
then
did
they
go
there
to
meet
van
burnam
and
kill
her
that
their
way
might
be
clearer
for
flight
no
i
had
rather
think
that
they
went
to
the
house
without
a
thought
of
whom
they
would
encounter
and
that
only
after
they
had
entered
the
parlors
did
he
realize
that
the
two
women
he
least
wished
to
see
together
had
been
brought
by
his
folly
face
to
face
the
presence
in
the
third
room
of
van
burnam
hat
gloves
and
novel
seemed
to
argue
that
she
had
spent
the
evening
in
reading
by
the
table
but
whether
this
was
so
or
not
the
stopping
of
a
carriage
in
front
and
the
opening
of
the
door
by
an
accustomed
hand
undoubtedly
assured
her
that
either
the
old
gentleman
or
some
other
member
of
the
family
had
unexpectedly
arrived
she
was
therefore
in
or
near
the
when
they
entered
and
the
shock
of
meeting
her
hated
rival
in
company
with
her
husband
under
the
very
roof
where
she
had
hoped
to
lay
the
foundations
of
her
future
happiness
must
have
been
great
if
not
maddening
accusations
recriminations
even
did
not
satisfy
her
she
wanted
to
kill
but
she
had
no
weapon
suddenly
her
eyes
fell
on
the
which
her
more
rival
had
drawn
from
her
hat
possibly
before
their
encounter
and
she
conceived
a
plan
which
seemed
to
promise
her
the
very
revenge
she
sought
how
she
carried
it
out
by
what
means
she
was
enabled
to
approach
her
victim
and
inflict
with
such
certainty
the
fatal
stab
which
laid
her
enemy
at
her
feet
can
be
left
to
the
imagination
but
that
she
a
woman
and
not
howard
a
man
drove
this
woman
weapon
into
the
stranger
spine
i
will
yet
prove
or
lose
all
faith
in
my
own
intuitions
but
if
this
theory
is
true
how
about
the
shelves
that
fell
at
daybreak
and
how
about
her
escape
from
the
house
without
detection
a
little
thought
will
explain
all
that
the
man
horrified
no
doubt
at
the
result
of
his
imprudence
and
execrating
the
crime
to
which
it
had
led
left
the
house
almost
immediately
but
the
woman
remained
there
possibly
because
she
had
fainted
possibly
because
he
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
and
coming
to
herself
saw
her
victim
face
staring
up
at
her
with
an
accusing
beauty
she
found
it
impossible
to
meet
what
should
she
do
to
escape
it
where
should
she
go
she
hated
it
so
she
could
have
trampled
on
it
but
she
restrained
her
passions
till
daybreak
when
in
one
wild
burst
of
fury
and
hatred
she
drew
down
the
cabinet
upon
it
and
then
fled
the
scene
of
horror
she
had
herself
caused
this
was
at
five
or
to
be
exact
three
minutes
before
that
hour
as
shown
by
the
clock
she
had
carelessly
set
in
her
lighter
moments
she
escaped
by
the
front
door
which
her
husband
had
mercifully
forborne
to
lock
and
she
had
not
been
discovered
by
the
police
because
her
appearance
did
not
tally
with
the
description
which
had
been
given
them
how
did
i
know
this
remember
the
discoveries
i
had
made
in
miss
van
burnam
room
and
allow
them
to
assist
you
in
understanding
my
conclusions
some
one
had
gone
into
that
room
some
one
who
wanted
pins
and
keeping
this
fact
before
my
eyes
i
saw
through
the
motive
and
actions
of
the
escaping
woman
she
had
on
a
dress
separated
at
the
waist
and
finding
perhaps
a
spot
of
blood
on
the
skirt
she
conceived
the
plan
of
covering
it
with
her
petticoat
which
was
also
of
silk
and
undoubtedly
as
well
made
as
many
women
dresses
but
the
skirt
of
the
gown
was
longer
than
the
petticoat
and
she
was
obliged
to
pin
it
up
having
no
pins
herself
and
finding
none
on
the
parlor
floor
she
went
to
get
some
the
door
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
was
locked
but
the
front
room
was
open
so
she
entered
there
groping
her
way
to
the
bureau
for
the
place
was
very
dark
she
found
a
hanging
from
a
bracket
feeling
it
to
be
full
of
pins
and
knowing
that
she
could
see
nothing
where
she
was
she
tore
it
away
and
carried
it
towards
the
door
here
there
was
some
light
from
the
skylight
over
the
stairs
so
setting
the
cushion
down
on
the
bed
she
pinned
up
the
skirt
of
her
gown
when
this
was
done
she
started
away
brushing
the
cushion
off
the
bed
in
her
excitement
and
fearing
to
be
traced
by
her
hat
or
having
no
courage
remaining
for
facing
again
the
horror
in
the
parlor
she
slid
out
without
one
and
went
god
knows
whither
in
her
terror
and
remorse
so
much
for
my
theory
now
for
the
facts
standing
in
the
way
of
its
complete
acceptance
they
were
two
the
scar
on
the
ankle
of
the
dead
girl
which
was
a
peculiarity
of
louise
van
burnam
and
the
mark
of
the
rings
on
her
fingers
but
who
had
identified
the
scar
her
husband
no
one
else
and
if
the
other
woman
had
by
some
strange
freak
of
chance
a
scar
also
on
her
left
foot
then
the
otherwise
unaccountable
apathy
he
had
shown
at
being
told
of
this
distinctive
mark
as
well
as
his
temerity
in
afterwards
taking
it
as
a
basis
for
his
false
identification
becomes
equally
consistent
and
natural
and
as
for
the
marks
of
the
rings
it
would
be
strange
if
such
a
woman
did
not
wear
rings
and
plenty
of
them
howard
conduct
under
examination
and
the
contradiction
between
his
first
assertions
and
those
that
followed
all
become
clear
in
the
light
of
this
new
theory
he
had
seen
his
wife
kill
a
defenceless
woman
before
his
eyes
and
whether
influenced
by
his
old
affection
for
her
or
by
his
pride
in
her
good
name
he
could
not
but
be
anxious
to
conceal
her
guilt
even
at
the
cost
of
his
own
truthfulness
as
long
then
as
circumstances
permitted
he
preserved
his
indifferent
attitude
and
denied
that
the
dead
woman
was
his
wife
but
when
driven
to
the
wall
by
the
indisputable
proof
which
was
brought
forth
of
his
wife
having
been
in
the
place
of
murder
he
saw
or
thought
he
did
that
a
continued
denial
on
his
part
of
louise
van
burnam
being
the
victim
might
lead
sooner
or
later
to
the
suspicion
of
her
being
the
murderer
and
influenced
by
this
fear
took
the
sudden
resolution
of
profiting
by
all
the
points
which
the
two
women
had
in
common
by
acknowledging
what
everybody
had
expected
him
to
acknowledge
from
the
first
that
the
woman
at
the
morgue
was
his
wife
this
would
exonerate
her
rid
him
of
any
apprehension
he
may
have
entertained
of
her
ever
returning
to
be
a
disgrace
to
him
and
would
and
perhaps
this
thought
influenced
him
most
for
who
can
understand
such
men
or
the
passions
that
sway
them
insure
the
object
of
his
late
devotion
a
decent
burial
in
a
christian
cemetery
to
be
sure
the
risk
he
ran
was
great
but
the
emergency
was
great
and
he
may
not
have
stopped
to
count
the
cost
at
all
events
the
fact
is
certain
that
he
perjured
himself
when
he
said
that
it
was
his
wife
he
brought
to
the
house
from
the
hotel
d
and
if
he
perjured
himself
in
this
regard
he
probably
perjured
himself
in
others
and
his
testimony
is
not
at
all
to
be
relied
upon
convinced
though
i
was
in
my
own
mind
that
i
had
struck
a
truth
which
would
bear
the
closest
investigation
i
was
not
satisfied
to
act
upon
it
till
i
had
put
it
to
the
test
the
means
i
took
to
do
this
were
daring
and
quite
in
keeping
with
the
whole
desperate
affair
they
promised
however
a
result
important
enough
to
make
gryce
blush
for
the
disdain
with
which
he
had
met
my
threats
of
interference
xxi
a
shrewd
conjecture
the
test
of
which
i
speak
was
as
follows
i
would
advertise
for
a
person
dressed
as
i
believed
van
burnam
to
have
been
when
she
left
the
scene
of
crime
if
i
received
news
of
such
a
person
i
might
safely
consider
my
theory
established
i
accordingly
wrote
the
following
advertisement
information
wanted
of
a
woman
who
applied
for
lodgings
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
dressed
in
a
brown
silk
skirt
and
a
black
and
white
plaid
blouse
of
fashionable
cut
she
was
without
a
hat
or
if
a
person
so
dressed
wore
a
hat
then
it
was
bought
early
in
the
morning
at
some
store
in
which
case
let
shopkeepers
take
notice
the
person
answering
this
description
is
eagerly
sought
for
by
her
relatives
and
to
any
one
giving
positive
information
of
the
same
a
liberal
reward
will
be
paid
please
address
alvord
liberty
street
i
purposely
did
not
mention
her
personal
appearance
for
fear
of
attracting
the
attention
of
the
police
this
done
i
wrote
the
following
letter
dear
miss
ferguson
one
clever
woman
recognizes
another
i
am
clever
and
am
not
ashamed
to
own
it
you
are
clever
and
should
not
be
ashamed
to
be
told
so
i
was
a
witness
at
the
inquest
in
which
you
so
notably
distinguished
yourself
and
i
said
then
is
a
woman
after
my
own
heart
but
a
truce
to
compliments
what
i
want
and
ask
of
you
to
procure
for
me
is
a
photograph
of
van
burnam
i
am
a
friend
of
the
family
and
consider
them
to
be
in
more
trouble
than
they
deserve
if
i
had
her
picture
i
would
show
it
to
the
misses
van
burnam
who
feel
great
remorse
at
their
treatment
of
her
and
who
want
to
see
how
she
looked
can
not
you
find
one
in
their
rooms
the
one
in
room
here
has
been
confiscated
by
the
police
c
hoping
that
you
will
feel
disposed
to
oblige
me
in
this
and
i
assure
you
that
my
motives
in
making
this
request
are
most
excellent
i
remain
cordially
yours
amelia
butterworth
address
me
if
you
please
at
avenue
care
of
h
denham
this
was
my
grocer
with
whom
i
left
word
the
next
morning
to
deliver
this
package
in
the
next
bushel
of
potatoes
he
sent
me
my
smart
little
maid
lena
carried
these
two
communications
to
the
east
side
where
she
posted
the
letter
herself
and
entrusted
the
advertisement
to
a
lover
of
hers
who
carried
it
to
the
office
while
she
was
gone
i
tried
to
rest
by
exercising
my
mind
in
other
directions
but
i
could
not
i
kept
going
over
howard
testimony
in
the
light
of
my
own
theory
and
remarking
how
the
difficulty
he
experienced
in
maintaining
the
position
he
had
taken
forced
him
into
inconsistencies
and
explanations
with
his
wife
for
a
companion
at
the
hotel
d
his
conduct
both
there
and
on
the
road
to
his
father
house
was
that
of
a
much
weaker
man
than
his
words
and
appearance
led
one
to
believe
but
if
on
the
contrary
he
had
with
him
a
woman
with
whom
he
was
about
to
elope
and
what
did
the
packing
up
of
all
his
effects
mean
if
not
that
all
the
precautions
they
took
seemed
reasonable
later
my
mind
fixed
itself
on
one
point
if
it
was
his
wife
who
was
with
him
as
he
said
then
the
bundle
they
dropped
at
the
old
feet
contained
the
of
plaid
silk
if
it
was
not
then
it
was
a
gown
of
some
different
material
now
could
this
bundle
be
found
if
it
could
then
why
had
not
gryce
produced
it
the
sight
of
van
burnam
plaid
silk
spread
out
on
the
coroner
table
would
have
had
a
great
effect
in
clinching
the
suspicion
against
her
husband
but
no
plaid
silk
had
been
found
because
it
was
not
dropped
in
the
bundle
but
worn
away
on
the
murderess
back
and
no
old
woman
i
thought
i
knew
the
reason
of
this
too
there
was
no
old
woman
to
be
found
and
the
bundle
they
carried
had
been
got
rid
of
some
other
way
what
way
i
would
take
a
walk
down
that
same
block
and
see
and
i
would
take
it
at
the
midnight
hour
too
for
only
so
could
i
judge
of
the
possibilities
there
offered
for
concealing
or
destroying
such
an
article
having
made
this
decision
i
cast
about
to
see
how
i
could
carry
it
into
effect
i
am
not
a
coward
but
i
have
a
respectability
to
maintain
and
what
errand
could
miss
butterworth
be
supposed
to
have
in
the
streets
at
twelve
at
night
fortunately
i
remembered
that
my
cook
had
complained
of
toothache
when
i
gave
her
my
orders
for
breakfast
and
going
down
at
once
into
the
kitchen
where
she
sat
with
her
cheek
propped
up
in
her
hand
waiting
for
lena
i
said
with
an
asperity
which
admitted
of
no
reply
you
have
a
dreadful
tooth
sarah
and
you
must
have
something
done
for
it
at
once
when
lena
comes
home
send
her
to
me
i
am
going
to
the
for
some
drops
and
i
want
lena
to
accompany
me
she
looked
astounded
of
course
but
i
would
not
let
her
answer
me
do
speak
a
word
i
cried
it
will
only
make
your
toothache
worse
and
do
look
as
if
some
hobgoblin
had
jumped
up
on
the
kitchen
table
i
guess
i
know
my
duty
and
just
what
kind
of
a
breakfast
i
will
have
in
the
morning
if
you
sit
up
all
night
groaning
with
the
toothache
and
i
was
out
of
the
room
before
she
had
more
than
begun
to
say
that
it
was
not
so
bad
and
that
i
need
trouble
and
all
that
which
was
true
enough
no
doubt
but
not
what
i
wanted
to
hear
at
that
moment
when
lena
came
in
i
saw
by
the
brightness
of
her
face
that
she
had
accomplished
her
double
errand
i
therefore
signified
to
her
that
i
was
satisfied
and
asked
if
she
was
too
tired
to
go
out
again
saying
quite
peremptorily
that
sarah
was
ill
and
that
i
was
going
to
the
for
some
medicine
and
did
not
wish
to
go
alone
lena
wonder
was
amusing
but
she
is
very
discreet
as
i
have
said
before
and
she
ventured
nothing
save
a
meek
it
very
late
miss
butterworth
which
was
an
unnecessary
remark
as
she
soon
saw
i
do
not
like
to
obtrude
my
aristocratic
tendencies
too
much
into
this
narrative
but
when
i
found
myself
in
the
streets
alone
with
lena
i
could
not
help
feeling
some
secret
qualms
lest
my
conduct
savored
of
impropriety
but
the
thought
that
i
was
working
in
the
cause
of
truth
and
justice
came
to
sustain
me
and
before
i
had
gone
two
blocks
i
felt
as
much
at
home
under
the
midnight
skies
as
if
i
were
walking
home
from
church
on
a
sunday
afternoon
there
is
a
certain
on
third
avenue
where
i
like
to
deal
and
towards
this
i
ostensibly
directed
my
steps
but
i
took
pains
to
go
by
the
way
of
lexington
avenue
and
street
and
upon
reaching
the
block
where
this
mysterious
couple
were
seen
gave
all
my
attention
to
the
possible
it
offered
lena
who
had
followed
me
like
my
shadow
and
who
was
evidently
too
dumfounded
at
my
freak
to
speak
drew
up
to
my
side
as
we
were
down
it
and
seized
me
tremblingly
by
the
arm
two
men
are
coming
said
she
i
am
not
afraid
of
men
was
my
sharp
rejoinder
but
i
told
a
most
abominable
lie
for
i
am
afraid
of
them
in
such
places
and
under
such
circumstances
though
not
under
ordinary
conditions
and
never
where
the
tongue
is
likely
to
be
the
only
weapon
employed
the
couple
who
were
approaching
us
now
seemed
to
be
in
a
merry
mood
but
when
they
saw
us
keep
to
our
own
side
of
the
way
they
stopped
their
chaffing
and
allowed
us
to
go
by
with
just
a
mocking
word
or
two
sarah
ought
to
be
very
much
obliged
to
you
whispered
lena
at
the
corner
of
third
avenue
i
paused
i
had
seen
nothing
so
far
but
bare
stoops
and
dark
nothing
to
suggest
a
place
for
the
disposal
of
such
cumbersome
articles
as
these
persons
had
made
way
with
had
the
avenue
anything
better
to
offer
i
stopped
under
the
at
the
corner
to
consider
notwithstanding
lena
gentle
pull
towards
the
looking
to
left
and
right
and
over
the
muddy
crossings
i
sought
for
inspiration
an
almost
obstinate
belief
in
my
own
theory
led
me
to
insist
in
my
own
mind
that
they
had
encountered
no
old
woman
and
consequently
had
not
dropped
their
bundles
in
the
open
street
i
even
entered
into
an
argument
about
it
standing
there
with
the
cable
cars
whistling
by
me
and
lena
tugging
away
at
my
arm
if
said
i
to
myself
the
woman
with
him
had
been
his
wife
and
the
whole
thing
nothing
more
than
a
foolish
escapade
they
might
have
done
this
but
she
was
not
his
wife
and
the
game
they
were
playing
was
serious
if
they
did
laugh
over
it
and
so
their
disposal
of
these
articles
would
be
serious
and
such
as
would
protect
their
secret
where
then
could
they
have
thrust
them
my
eyes
as
i
muttered
this
were
on
the
one
shop
in
my
line
of
vision
that
was
still
open
and
lighted
it
was
the
den
of
a
chinese
laundryman
and
through
the
windows
in
front
i
could
see
him
still
at
work
ironing
ah
thought
i
and
made
such
a
start
across
the
street
that
lena
gasped
in
dismay
and
almost
fell
to
the
ground
in
her
frightened
attempt
to
follow
me
not
that
way
she
called
miss
butterworth
you
are
going
wrong
but
i
kept
right
on
and
only
stopped
when
i
reached
the
laundry
i
have
an
errand
here
i
explained
wait
in
the
doorway
lena
and
do
act
as
if
you
thought
me
crazy
for
i
was
never
saner
in
my
life
i
do
think
this
reassured
her
much
lunatics
not
being
supposed
to
be
very
good
judges
of
their
own
mental
condition
but
she
was
so
accustomed
to
obey
that
she
drew
back
as
i
opened
the
door
before
me
and
entered
the
surprise
on
the
face
of
the
poor
chinaman
when
he
turned
and
saw
before
him
a
lady
of
years
and
no
ordinary
appearance
daunted
me
for
an
instant
but
another
look
only
showed
me
that
his
very
surprise
was
inoffensive
and
gathering
courage
from
the
unexpectedness
of
my
own
position
i
inquired
with
all
the
politeness
i
could
show
one
of
his
abominable
nationality
did
a
gentleman
and
a
heavily
veiled
lady
leave
a
package
with
you
a
few
days
ago
at
about
the
same
hour
of
night
as
this
some
lalee
clo
washee
yes
no
done
she
tellee
me
no
callee
for
one
week
then
that
all
right
the
lady
has
died
very
suddenly
and
the
gentleman
gone
away
you
will
have
to
keep
the
clothes
a
long
time
me
wantee
money
no
wantee
clo
i
pay
you
for
them
i
do
care
about
them
being
ironed
givee
tickee
givee
clo
no
givee
tickee
no
givee
clo
this
was
a
poser
but
as
i
did
not
want
the
clothes
so
much
as
a
look
at
them
i
soon
got
the
better
of
this
difficulty
i
do
want
them
said
i
i
only
wanted
to
make
sure
you
had
them
what
night
were
these
people
here
tuesday
night
velly
late
nicee
man
nicee
lalee
she
wantee

nicee
man
he
pullee
she
i
no
hear
if
muchee
stasch
all
washee
see
he
went
on
dragging
a
basket
out
of
the
corner
him
no
ilon
i
was
in
such
a
quiver
so
struck
with
amazement
at
my
own
perspicacity
in
surmising
that
here
was
a
place
where
a
bundle
of
underclothing
could
be
lost
indefinitely
that
i
just
stared
while
he
turned
over
the
clothes
in
the
basket
for
by
means
of
the
quality
of
the
articles
he
was
preparing
to
show
me
the
question
which
had
been
agitating
me
for
hours
could
be
definitely
decided
if
they
proved
to
be
fine
and
of
foreign
manufacture
then
howard
story
was
true
and
all
my
theories
must
fall
to
the
ground
but
if
on
the
contrary
they
were
such
as
are
usually
worn
by
american
women
then
my
own
idea
as
to
the
identity
of
the
woman
who
left
them
here
was
established
and
i
could
safely
consider
her
as
the
victim
and
louise
van
burnam
as
the
murderess
unless
further
facts
came
to
prove
that
he
was
the
guilty
one
after
all
the
sight
of
lena
eyes
staring
at
me
with
great
anxiety
through
the
panes
of
the
door
distracted
my
attention
for
a
moment
and
when
i
looked
again
he
was
holding
up
two
or
three
garments
before
me
the
articles
thus
revealed
told
their
story
in
a
moment
they
were
far
from
fine
and
had
even
less
embroidery
on
them
than
i
expected
are
there
any
marks
on
them
i
asked
he
showed
me
two
letters
stamped
in
indelible
ink
on
the
band
of
a
skirt
i
did
not
have
my
glasses
with
me
but
the
ink
was
black
and
i
read
the
minx
initials
thought
i
when
i
left
the
place
my
complacency
was
such
that
lena
did
not
know
what
to
make
of
me
she
has
since
informed
me
that
i
looked
as
if
i
wanted
to
shout
hurrah
but
i
can
not
believe
i
so
far
forgot
myself
as
that
but
pleased
as
i
was
i
had
only
discovered
how
one
bundle
had
been
disposed
of
the
dress
and
outside
fixings
still
had
to
be
accounted
for
and
i
was
the
woman
to
do
it
we
had
mechanically
moved
in
the
direction
of
the
and
were
near
the
when
i
reached
this
point
in
my
meditations
it
had
rained
a
little
while
before
and
a
small
stream
was
running
down
the
gutter
and
emptying
itself
into
the
sewer
opening
the
sight
of
it
sharpened
my
wits
if
i
wanted
to
get
rid
of
anything
of
a
damaging
character
i
would
drop
it
at
the
mouth
of
one
of
these
holes
and
gently
thrust
it
into
the
sewer
with
my
foot
thought
i
and
never
doubting
that
i
had
found
an
explanation
of
the
disappearance
of
the
second
bundle
i
walked
on
deciding
that
if
i
had
the
police
at
my
command
i
would
have
the
sewer
searched
at
those
four
corners
we
rode
home
after
visiting
the
i
was
not
going
to
subject

or
myself
to
another
midnight

a
blank
card
the
next
day
at
noon
lena
brought
me
up
a
card
on
her
tray
it
was
a
perfectly
blank
one
miss

said
you
sent
for

was

is

said
i
taking
the
card
and
with
it
a
fresh
installment
of
courage
nothing
happened
for
two
days
then
there
came
word
from
the
kitchen
that
a
bushel
of
potatoes
had
arrived
going
down
to
see
them
i
drew
from
their
midst
a
large
square
envelope
which
i
immediately
carried
to
my
room
it
failed
to
contain
a
photograph
but
there
was
a
letter
in
it
couched
in
these
terms
dear
miss
butterworth
the
esteem
which
you
are
good
enough
to
express
for
me
is
returned
i
regret
that
i
can
not
oblige
you
there
are
no
photographs
to
be
found
in
van
burnam
rooms
perhaps
this
fact
may
be
accounted
for
by
the
curiosity
shown
in
those
apartments
by
a
very
spruce
new
boarder
we
have
had
from
new
york
his
taste
for
that
particular
quarter
of
the
house
was
such
that
i
could
not
keep
him
away
from
it
except
by
lock
and
key
if
there
was
a
picture
there
of
van
burnam
he
took
it
for
he
departed
very
suddenly
one
night
i
am
glad
he
took
nothing
more
with
him
the
talks
he
had
with
my
have
almost
led
to
my
dismissing
her
praying
your
pardon
for
the
disappointment
i
am
forced
to
give
you

remain
yours

amelia
butterworth
this
was
on
a
thursday
and
on
the
evening
of
saturday
the
clue
was
given
me
it
came
in
the
shape
of
a
letter
brought
me
by
alvord
our
interview
was
not
an
agreeable
one
alvord
is
a
clever
man
and
an
adroit
one
or
i
should
not
persist
in
employing
him
as
my
lawyer
but
he
never
understood
at
this
time
and
with
this
letter
in
his
hand
he
understood
me
less
than
ever
which
naturally
called
out
my
powers
of
and
led
to
some
lively
conversation
between
us
but
that
is
neither
here
nor
there
he
had
brought
me
an
answer
to
my
advertisement
and
i
was
presently
engrossed
by
it
it
was
an
uneducated
woman
epistle
and
its
chirography
and
spelling
were
dreadful
so
i
will
just
mention
its
contents
which
were
highly
interesting
in
themselves
as
i
think
you
will
acknowledge
she
that
is
the
writer
whose
name
as
nearly
as
i
could
make
out
was
bertha
desberger
knew
such
a
person
as
i
described
and
could
give
me
news
of
her
if
i
would
come
to
her
house
in
west
ninth
street
at
four
sunday
afternoon
if
i
would
i
think
my
face
must
have
shown
my
satisfaction
for
alvord
who
was
watching
me
sarcastically
remarked
you
do
seem
to
find
any
difficulties
in
that
communication
now
what
do
you
think
of
this
one
he
held
out
another
letter
which
had
been
directed
to
him
and
which
he
had
opened
its
contents
called
up
a
shade
of
color
to
my
cheek
for
i
did
not
want
to
go
through
the
annoyance
of
explaining
myself
again
dear
sir
from
a
strange
advertisement
which
has
lately
appeared
in
the
i
gather
that
information
is
wanted
of
a
young
woman
who
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
inst
entered
my
store
without
any
bonnet
on
her
head
and
saying
she
had
met
with
an
accident
bought
a
hat
which
she
immediately
put
on
she
was
pale
as
a
girl
could
be
and
looked
so
ill
that
i
asked
her
if
she
was
well
enough
to
be
out
alone
but
she
gave
me
no
reply
and
left
the
store
as
soon
as
possible
that
is
all
i
can
tell
you
about
her
with
this
was
enclosed
his
card
phineas
cox
and
untrimmed
sixth
avenue
now
what
does
this
mean
asked
alvord
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
was
the
morning
when
the
murder
was
discovered
in
which
you
have
shown
such
interest
it
means
i
retorted
with
some
spirit
for
simple
dignity
was
thrown
away
on
this
man
that
i
made
a
mistake
in
choosing
your
office
as
a
medium
for
my
business
communications
this
was
to
the
point
and
he
said
no
more
though
he
eyed
the
letter
in
my
hand
very
curiously
and
seemed
more
than
tempted
to
renew
the
hostilities
with
which
we
had
opened
our
interview
had
it
not
been
saturday
and
late
in
the
day
at
that
i
would
have
visited
cox
store
before
i
slept
but
as
it
was
i
felt
obliged
to
wait
till
monday
meanwhile
i
had
before
me
the
still
more
important
interview
with
desberger
as
i
had
no
reason
to
think
that
my
visiting
any
number
in
ninth
street
would
arouse
suspicion
in
the
police
i
rode
there
quite
boldly
the
next
day
and
with
lena
at
my
side
entered
the
house
of
bertha
desberger
for
this
trip
i
had
dressed
myself
plainly
and
drawn
over
my
eyes
and
the
puffs
which
i
still
think
it
becoming
in
a
woman
of
my
age
to
wear
a
dotted
veil
thick
enough
to
conceal
my
features
without
robbing
me
of
that
aspect
of
benignity
necessary
to
the
success
of
my
mission
lena
wore
her
usual
neat
gray
dress
and
looked
the
picture
of
all
the
virtues
a
large
brass
well
rubbed
was
the
first
sign
vouchsafed
us
of
the
respectability
of
the
house
we
were
about
to
enter
and
the
parlor
when
we
were
ushered
into
it
fully
carried
out
the
promise
thus
held
forth
on
the
it
was
respectable
but
in
wretched
taste
as
regards
colors
i
who
have
the
nicest
taste
in
such
matters
looked
about
me
in
dismay
as
i
encountered
the
greens
and
blues
the
crimsons
and
the
purples
which
everywhere
surrounded
me
but
i
was
not
on
a
visit
to
a
temple
of
art
and
resolutely
shutting
my
eyes
to
the
offending
splendor
about
me
worsted
splendor
you
understand
i
waited
with
subdued
expectation
for
the
lady
of
the
house
she
came
in
presently
bedecked
in
a
flowered
gown
that
was
an
epitome
of
the
blaze
of
colors
everywhere
surrounding
us
but
her
face
was
a
good
one
and
i
saw
that
i
had
neither
guile
nor
shrewdness
to
contend
with
she
had
seen
the
coach
at
the
door
and
she
was
all
smiles
and
flutter
you
have
come
for
the
poor
girl
who
stopped
here
a
few
days
ago
she
began
glancing
from
my
face
to
lena
with
an
equally
inquiring
air
which
in
itself
would
have
shown
her
utter
ignorance
of
social
distinctions
if
i
had
not
bidden
lena
to
keep
at
my
side
and
hold
her
head
up
as
if
she
had
business
there
as
well
as
myself
yes
returned
i
we
have
lena
here
has
lost
a
relative
which
was
true
and
knowing
no
other
way
of
finding
her
i
suggested
the
insertion
of
an
advertisement
in
the
paper
you
read
the
description
given
of
course
has
the
person
answering
it
been
in
this
house
yes
she
came
on
the
morning
of
the
eighteenth
i
remember
it
because
that
was
the
very
day
my
cook
left
and
i
have
not
got
another
one
yet
she
sighed
and
went
on
i
took
a
great
interest
in
that
unhappy
young
woman
was
she
your
sister
this
somewhat
doubtfully
to
lena
who
perhaps
had
too
few
colors
on
to
suit
her
no
answered
lena
she
was
my
sister
but
i
immediately
took
the
words
out
of
her
mouth
at
what
time
did
she
come
here
and
how
long
did
she
stay
we
want
to
find
her
very
much
did
she
give
you
any
name
or
tell
where
she
was
going
she
said
her
name
was
oliver
i
thought
of
the
on
the
clothes
at
the
laundry
but
i
knew
this
was
so
and
if
she
had
not
looked
so
very
modest
i
might
have
hesitated
to
take
her
in
but
lor
i
resist
a
girl
in
trouble
and
she
was
in
trouble
if
ever
a
girl
was
and
then
she
had
money
do
you
know
what
her
trouble
was
this
again
to
lena
and
with
an
air
at
once
suspicious
and
curious
but
lena
has
a
good
face
too
and
her
frank
eyes
at
once
disarmed
the
weak
and
woman
before
us
i
thought
she
went
on
before
lena
could
answer
that
whatever
it
was
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
nor
this
lady
either
no
answered
lena
seeing
that
i
wished
her
to
do
the
talking
and
we
do
know
which
was
true
enough
so
far
as
lena
went
just
what
her
trouble
was
did
she
tell
you
she
told
nothing
when
she
came
she
said
she
wanted
to
stay
with
me
a
little
while
i
sometimes
take
boarders
she
had
twenty
in
the
house
at
that
minute
if
she
had
one
did
she
think
i
could
see
the
length
of
her
table
through
the
crack
of
the
parlor
door
can
pay
she
said
which
i
had
not
doubted
for
her
blouse
was
a
very
expensive
one
though
i
thought
her
skirt
looked
queer
and
her
hat
did
i
say
she
had
a
hat
on
you
seemed
to
doubt
that
fact
in
your
advertisement
goodness
me
if
she
had
had
no
hat
on
she
would
have
got
as
far
as
my
parlor
mat
but
her
blouse
showed
her
to
be
a
lady
and
then
her
face
it
was
as
white
as
your
handkerchief
there
madam
but
so
sweet
i
thought
of
the
madonna
faces
i
had
seen
in
catholic
churches
i
started
inwardly
commenting
woman
but
a
glance
at
the
room
about
me
reassured
me
the
owner
of
such
hideous
sofas
and
chairs
and
of
the
many
pictures
effacing
or
rather
defacing
the
paper
on
the
walls
could
not
be
a
judge
of
madonna
faces
you
admire
everything
that
is
good
and
lovely
i
suggested
for
desberger
had
paused
at
the
movement
i
made
yes
it
is
my
nature
to
do
so
i
love
the
beautiful
and
she
cast
a
look
about
her
so
i
listened
to
the
girl
and
let
her
sit
down
in
my
parlor
she
had
had
nothing
to
eat
that
morning
and
though
she
did
ask
for
it
i
went
to
order
her
a
cup
of
tea
for
i
knew
she
could
get
without
it
her
eyes
followed
me
when
i
went
out
of
the
room
in
a
way
that
haunted
me
and
when
i
came
back
i
shall
never
forget
it
there
she
lay
stretched
out
on
the
floor
with
her
face
on
the
ground
and
her
hands
thrown
out
was
it
horrible
i
do
wonder
you
shudder
did
i
shudder
if
i
did
it
was
because
i
was
thinking
of
that
other
woman
the
victim
of
this
one
whom
i
had
seen
with
her
face
turned
upward
and
her
arms
outstretched
in
the
gloom
of
van
parlor
she
looked
as
if
she
was
dead
the
good
woman
continued
but
just
as
i
was
about
to
call
for
help
her
fingers
moved
and
i
rushed
to
lift
her
she
was
neither
dead
nor
had
she
fainted
she
was
simply
dumb
with
misery
what
could
have
happened
to
her
i
have
asked
myself
a
hundred
times
my
mouth
was
shut
very
tight
but
i
shut
it
still
tighter
for
the
temptation
was
great
to
cry
she
had
just
committed
murder
as
it
was
no
sound
whatever
left
my
lips
and
the
good
woman
doubtless
thought
me
no
better
than
a
stone
for
she
turned
with
a
shrug
to
lena
repeating
still
more
wistfully
than
before
you
know
what
her
trouble
was
but
of
course
poor
lena
had
nothing
to
say
and
the
woman
went
on
with
a
sigh
well
i
suppose
i
shall
never
know
what
had
used
that
poor
creature
up
so
completely
but
whatever
it
was
it
gave
me
enough
trouble
though
i
do
not
want
to
complain
of
it
for
why
are
we
here
if
not
to
help
and
comfort
the
miserable
it
was
an
hour
it
was
an
hour
miss
before
i
could
get
that
poor
girl
to
speak
but
when
i
did
succeed
and
had
got
her
to
drink
the
tea
and
eat
a
bit
of
toast
then
i
felt
quite
repaid
by
the
look
of
gratitude
she
gave
me
and
the
way
she
clung
to
my
sleeve
when
i
tried
to
leave
her
for
a
minute
it
was
this
sleeve
she
explained
lifting
a
cluster
of
rainbow
flounces
and
ribbons
which
but
a
minute
before
had
looked
little
short
of
ridiculous
in
my
eyes
but
which
in
the
light
of
the
wearer
had
lost
some
of
their
offensive
appearance
poor
mary
murmured
lena
with
what
i
considered
most
admirable
presence
of
mind
what
name
did
you
say
cried
desberger
eager
enough
to
learn
all
she
could
of
her
late
mysterious
lodger
i
had
rather
not
tell
her
name
protested
lena
with
a
timid
air
that
admirably
fitted
her
rather
prettiness
did
tell
you
what
it
was
and
do
think
i
ought
to
good
for
little
lena
and
she
did
not
even
know
for
whom
or
what
she
was
playing
the
i
had
set
her
i
thought
you
said
mary
but
i
wo
be
inquisitive
with
you
i
so
with
her
but
where
was
i
in
my
story
oh
i
got
her
so
she
could
speak
and
afterwards
i
helped
her
but
she
did
stay
there
long
when
i
came
back
at
lunch
time
i
have
to
do
my
marketing
no
matter
what
happens
i
found
her
sitting
before
a
table
with
her
head
on
her
hands
she
had
been
weeping
but
her
face
was
quite
composed
now
and
almost
hard
you
good
woman
she
cried
as
i
came
in
want
to
thank
you
but
i
would
let
her
go
on
wasting
words
like
that
and
presently
she
was
saying
quite
wildly
want
to
begin
a
new
life
i
want
to
act
as
if
i
had
never
had
a
yesterday
i
have
had
trouble
overwhelming
trouble
but
i
will
get
something
out
of
existence
yet
i
live
and
in
order
to
do
so
i
will
work
have
you
a
paper
desberger
i
want
to
look
at
the
advertisements
i
brought
her
a
and
went
to
preside
at
my
lunch
table
when
i
saw
her
again
she
looked
almost
cheerful
have
found
just
what
i
want
she
cried
companion
place
but
i
can
not
apply
in
this
dress
and
she
looked
at
the
great
puffs
of
her
silk
blouse
as
if
they
gave
her
the
horrors
though
why
i
can
not
imagine
for
they
were
in
the
latest
style
and
rich
enough
for
a
daughter
though
as
to
colors
i
like
brighter
ones
myself
you
she
was
very
timid
about
it
me
some
things
if
i
gave
you
the
money
if
there
is
one
thing
more
than
another
that
i
like
it
is
to
shop
so
i
expressed
my
willingness
to
oblige
her
and
that
afternoon
i
set
out
with
a
nice
little
sum
of
money
to
buy
her
some
clothes
i
should
have
enjoyed
it
more
if
she
had
let
me
do
my
own
choosing
i
saw
the
loveliest
pink
and
green
blouse
but
she
was
very
set
about
what
she
wanted
and
so
i
just
got
her
some
plain
things
which
i
think
even
you
would
have
approved
of
i
brought
them
home
myself
for
she
wanted
to
apply
immediately
for
the
place
she
had
seen
advertised
but
o
dear
when
i
went
up
to
her
room
was
she
gone
burst
in
lena
o
no
but
there
was
such
a
smudge
in
it
and
and
i
could
cry
when
i
think
of
it
there
in
the
grate
were
the
remains
of
her
beautiful
silk
blouse
all
smoking
and
ruined
she
had
tried
to
burn
it
and
she
had
succeeded
too
i
could
not
get
a
piece
out
as
big
as
my
hand
but
you
got
some
of
it
blurted
out
lena
guided
by
a
look
which
i
gave
her
yes
scraps
it
was
so
handsome
i
think
i
have
a
bit
in
my
now
o
get
it
for
me
urged
lena
i
want
it
to
remember
her
by
my
is
here
and
going
to
a
sort
of
covered
with
a
thousand
picked
up
at
bargain
counters
she
opened
a
little
cupboard
and
brought
out
a
basket
from
which
she
presently
pulled
a
small
square
of
silk
it
was
as
she
said
of
the
richest
weaving
and
was
as
i
had
not
the
least
doubt
a
portion
of
the
dress
worn
by
van
burnam
from
haddam
yes
it
was
hers
said
lena
reading
the
expression
of
my
face
and
putting
the
scrap
away
very
carefully
in
her
pocket
well
i
would
have
given
her
five
dollars
for
that
blouse
murmured
desberger
regretfully
but
girls
like
her
are
so
improvident
and
did
she
leave
that
day
i
asked
seeing
that
it
was
hard
for
this
woman
to
tear
her
thoughts
away
from
this
coveted
article
yes
it
was
late
and
i
had
but
little
hopes
of
her
getting
the
situation
she
was
after
but
she
promised
to
come
back
if
she
did
and
as
she
did
not
come
back
i
decided
that
she
was
more
successful
than
i
had
anticipated
and
do
you
know
where
she
went
did
she
confide
in
you
at
all
no
but
as
there
were
but
three
advertisements
for
a
in
the
that
day
it
will
be
easy
to
find
her
would
you
like
to
see
those
advertisements
i
saved
them
out
of
curiosity
i
assented
as
you
may
believe
and
she
brought
us
the
clippings
at
once
two
of
them
i
read
without
emotion
but
the
third
almost
took
my
breath
away
it
was
an
advertisement
for
a
accustomed
to
the
typewriter
and
of
some
taste
in
dressmaking
and
the
address
given
was
that
of
miss
althorpe
if
this
woman
steeped
in
misery
and
darkened
by
crime
should
be
there
as
i
shall
not
mention
desberger
again
for
some
time
i
will
here
say
that
at
the
first
opportunity
which
presented
itself
i
sent
lena
to
the
shops
with
orders
to
buy
and
have
sent
to
desberger
the
ugliest
and
most
flaunting
of
silk
blouses
that
could
be
found
on
sixth
avenue
and
as
lena
dimples
were
more
than
usually
pronounced
on
her
return
i
have
no
doubt
she
chose
one
to
suit
the
taste
and
warm
the
body
of
the
estimable
woman
whose
kindly
nature
had
made
such
a
favorable
impression
upon
me
xxiii
ruth
oliver
from
desberger
i
rode
immediately
to
miss
althorpe
for
the
purpose
of
satisfying
myself
at
once
as
to
the
presence
there
of
the
unhappy
fugitive
i
was
tracing
six
sunday
night
is
not
a
favorable
hour
for
calling
at
a
young
lady
house
especially
when
that
lady
has
a
lover
who
is
in
the
habit
of
taking
tea
with
the
family
but
i
was
in
a
mood
to
transgress
all
rules
and
even
to
forget
the
rights
of
lovers
besides
much
is
forgiven
a
woman
of
my
stamp
especially
by
a
person
of
the
good
sense
and
amiability
of
miss
althorpe
that
i
was
not
mistaken
in
my
calculations
was
evident
from
the
greeting
i
received
miss
althorpe
came
forward
as
graciously
and
with
as
little
surprise
in
her
manner
as
any
one
could
expect
under
the
circumstances
and
for
a
moment
i
was
so
touched
by
her
beauty
and
the
unaffected
charm
of
her
manners
that
i
forgot
my
errand
and
only
thought
of
the
pleasure
of
meeting
a
lady
who
fairly
comes
up
to
the
standard
one
has
secretly
set
for
one
self
of
course
she
is
much
younger
than
i
some
say
she
is
only
but
a
lady
is
a
lady
at
any
age
and
ella
althorpe
might
be
a
model
for
a
much
older
woman
than
myself
the
room
in
which
we
were
seated
was
a
large
one
and
though
i
could
hear
stone
voice
in
the
adjoining
apartment
i
did
not
fear
to
broach
the
subject
i
had
come
to
discuss
you
may
think
this
intrusion
an
odd
one
i
began
but
i
believe
you
advertised
a
few
days
ago
for
a
young
have
you
been
suited
miss
althorpe
o
yes
i
have
a
young
person
with
me
whom
i
like
very
much
ah
you
are
supplied
is
she
any
one
you
know
no
she
is
a
stranger
and
what
is
more
she
brought
no
recommendations
with
her
but
her
appearance
is
so
attractive
and
her
desire
for
the
place
was
so
great
that
i
consented
to
try
her
and
she
is
very
satisfactory
poor
girl
very
satisfactory
indeed
ah
here
was
an
opportunity
for
questions
without
showing
too
much
eagerness
and
yet
with
a
proper
show
of
interest
i
smilingly
remarked
no
one
can
be
called
poor
long
who
remains
under
your
roof
miss
althorpe
but
perhaps
she
has
lost
friends
so
many
nice
girls
are
thrown
upon
their
own
resources
by
the
death
of
relatives
she
does
not
wear
mourning
but
she
is
in
some
great
trouble
for
all
that
but
this
can
not
interest
you
miss
butterworth
have
you
some
whom
you
wished
to
recommend
for
the
position
i
heard
her
but
did
not
answer
at
once
in
fact
i
was
thinking
how
to
proceed
should
i
take
her
into
my
confidence
or
should
i
continue
in
the
ambiguous
manner
in
which
i
had
begun
seeing
her
smile
i
became
conscious
of
the
awkward
silence
pardon
me
said
i
resuming
my
best
manner
but
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
which
may
strike
you
as
peculiar
o
no
said
she
i
interested
in
the
girl
you
have
befriended
and
for
very
different
reasons
from
those
you
suppose
i
fear
i
have
great
reason
to
fear
that
she
is
not
just
the
person
you
would
like
to
harbor
under
your
roof
indeed
why
what
do
you
know
about
her
anything
bad
miss
butterworth
i
shook
my
head
and
prayed
her
first
to
tell
me
how
the
girl
looked
and
under
what
circumstances
she
came
to
her
for
i
was
desirous
of
making
no
mistake
concerning
her
identity
with
the
person
of
whom
i
was
in
search
she
is
a
girl
was
the
answer
i
received
not
beautiful
but
interesting
in
expression
and
manner
she
has
brown
hair
i
shuddered
brown
eyes
and
a
mouth
that
would
be
lovely
if
it
ever
smiled
in
fact
she
is
very
attractive
and
so
that
i
have
desired
to
make
a
companion
of
her
but
while
attentive
to
all
her
duties
and
manifestly
grateful
to
me
for
the
home
i
have
given
her
she
shows
so
little
desire
for
company
or
conversation
that
i
have
desisted
for
the
last
day
or
so
from
urging
her
to
speak
at
all
but
you
asked
me
under
what
circumstances
she
came
to
me
yes
on
what
day
and
at
what
time
of
day
was
she
dressed
well
or
did
her
clothes
look
shabby
she
came
on
the
very
day
i
advertised
the
eighteenth
yes
it
was
the
eighteenth
of
this
month
and
she
was
dressed
so
far
as
i
noticed
very
neatly
indeed
her
clothes
appeared
to
be
new
they
needed
to
have
been
for
she
brought
nothing
with
her
save
what
was
contained
in
a
small
also
new
i
suggested
very
likely
i
did
not
observe
o
miss
althorpe
i
exclaimed
this
time
with
considerable
vehemence
i
fear
or
rather
i
hope
she
is
the
woman
i
want
want
yes
but
i
can
not
tell
you
for
what
just
yet
i
must
be
sure
for
i
would
not
subject
an
innocent
person
to
suspicion
any
more
than
you
would
suspicion
she
is
not
honest
then
that
would
worry
me
miss
butterworth
for
the
house
is
full
now
as
you
know
of
wedding
presents
and
but
i
can
not
believe
such
a
thing
of
it
is
some
other
fault
she
has
less
despicable
and
degrading
i
do
not
say
she
has
any
faults
i
only
said
i
feared
what
name
does
she
go
by
oliver
ruth
oliver
again
i
thought
of
the
on
the
clothes
at
the
laundry
i
wish
i
could
see
her
i
ventured
i
would
give
anything
for
a
peep
at
her
face
unobserved
i
do
know
how
i
can
manage
she
is
very
shy
and
never
shows
herself
in
the
front
of
the
house
she
even
dines
in
her
own
room
having
begged
for
that
privilege
till
after
i
was
married
and
the
household
settled
on
a
new
basis
but
you
can
go
to
her
room
with
me
if
she
is
all
right
she
can
have
no
objection
to
a
visitor
and
if
she
is
it
would
be
well
for
me
to
know
it
at
once
certainly
said
i
and
rose
to
follow
her
turning
over
in
my
mind
how
i
should
account
to
this
young
woman
for
my
intrusion
i
had
just
arrived
at
what
i
considered
a
sensible
conclusion
when
miss
althorpe
leaning
towards
me
said
with
a
impetuosity
for
which
i
could
not
but
admire
her
the
girl
is
very
nervous
she
looks
and
acts
like
a
person
who
has
had
some
frightful
shock
do
alarm
her
miss
butterworth
and
accuse
her
of
anything
wrong
too
suddenly
perhaps
she
is
innocent
and
perhaps
if
she
is
not
innocent
she
has
been
driven
into
evil
by
very
great
temptations
i
am
sorry
for
her
whether
she
is
simply
unhappy
or
deeply
remorseful
for
i
never
saw
a
sweeter
face
or
eyes
with
such
boundless
depths
of
misery
in
them
just
what
desberger
had
said
strange
but
i
began
to
feel
a
certain
sort
of
sympathy
for
the
wretched
being
i
was
hunting
down
i
will
be
careful
said
i
i
merely
want
to
satisfy
myself
that
she
is
the
same
girl
i
heard
of
last
from
a
mrs
desberger
miss
althorpe
who
was
now
up
the
rich
staircase
which
makes
her
house
one
of
the
most
remarkable
in
the
city
turned
and
gave
me
a
quick
look
over
her
shoulder
i
do
know
desberger
she
remarked
at
which
i
smiled
did
she
think
desberger
in
society
at
the
end
of
an
upper
we
paused
this
is
the
door
whispered
miss
althorpe
perhaps
i
had
better
go
in
first
and
see
if
she
is
at
all
prepared
for
company
i
was
glad
to
have
her
do
so
for
i
felt
as
if
i
needed
to
prepare
myself
for
encountering
this
young
girl
over
whom
in
my
mind
hung
the
dreadful
suspicion
of
murder
but
the
time
between
miss
althorpe
knock
and
her
entrance
short
as
it
was
was
longer
than
that
which
elapsed
between
her
going
in
and
her
hasty
reappearance
you
can
have
your
wish
said
she
she
is
lying
on
her
bed
asleep
and
you
can
see
her
without
being
observed
but
she
entreated
with
a
passionate
grip
of
my
arm
which
proclaimed
her
warm
nature
does
it
seem
a
little
like
taking
advantage
of
her
circumstances
justify
it
in
this
case
i
replied
admiring
the
consideration
of
my
hostess
but
not
thinking
it
worth
while
to
emulate
it
and
with
very
little
ceremony
i
pushed
open
the
door
and
entered
the
room
of
the
ruth
oliver
the
hush
and
quiet
which
met
me
though
nothing
more
than
i
had
reason
to
expect
gave
me
my
first
shock
and
the
young
figure
outstretched
on
a
bed
of
dainty
whiteness
my
second
everything
about
me
was
so
peaceful
and
the
delicate
blue
and
white
of
the
room
so
expressive
of
innocence
and
repose
that
my
feet
instinctively
moved
more
softly
over
the
polished
floor
and
paused
when
they
did
pause
before
that
dimly
shrouded
bed
with
something
like
hesitation
in
their
usually
emphatic
tread
the
face
of
that
bed
occupant
which
i
could
now
plainly
see
may
have
had
an
influence
in
producing
this
effect
it
was
so
rounded
with
health
and
yet
so
haggard
with
trouble
not
knowing
whether
miss
althorpe
was
behind
me
or
not
but
too
intent
upon
the
sleeping
girl
to
care
i
bent
over
the
features
and
studied
them
carefully
they
were
indeed
something
which
i
had
not
expected
notwithstanding
the
assurances
i
had
received
to
that
effect
and
while
distorted
with
suffering
amply
accounted
for
the
interest
shown
in
her
by
the
desberger
and
the
cultured
miss
althorpe
resenting
this
beauty
which
so
poorly
accommodated
itself
to
the
character
of
the
woman
who
possessed
it
i
leaned
nearer
searching
for
some
defect
in
her
loveliness
when
i
saw
that
the
struggle
and
anguish
visible
in
her
expression
were
due
to
some
dream
she
was
having
moved
even
against
my
will
by
the
touching
sight
of
her
trembling
eyelids
and
working
mouth
i
was
about
to
wake
her
when
i
was
stopped
by
the
gentle
touch
of
miss
althorpe
on
my
shoulder
is
she
the
girl
you
are
looking
for
i
gave
one
quick
glance
around
the
room
and
my
eyes
lighted
on
the
little
blue
on
the
bureau
did
you
put
those
pins
there
i
asked
pointing
to
a
dozen
or
more
black
pins
grouped
in
one
corner
did
not
no
and
i
doubt
if
crescenze
did
why
i
drew
a
small
black
pin
from
my
belt
where
i
had
securely
fastened
it
and
carrying
it
over
to
the
cushion
compared
it
with
those
i
saw
they
were
identical
a
small
matter
i
inwardly
decided
but
it
points
in
the
right
direction
then
in
answer
to
miss
althorpe
added
aloud
i
fear
she
is
at
least
i
have
seen
no
reason
yet
for
doubting
it
but
i
must
make
sure
will
you
allow
me
to
wake
her
o
it
seems
cruel
she
is
suffering
enough
already
see
how
she
twists
and
turns
it
will
be
a
mercy
it
seems
to
me
to
rouse
her
from
dreams
so
full
of
pain
and
trouble
perhaps
but
i
will
leave
you
alone
to
do
it
what
will
you
say
to
her
how
account
for
your
intrusion
o
i
will
find
means
and
they
wo
be
too
cruel
either
you
had
better
stand
back
by
the
bureau
and
listen
i
think
i
had
rather
not
have
the
responsibility
of
doing
this
thing
alone
miss
althorpe
not
understanding
my
hesitation
and
only
half
comprehending
my
errand
gave
me
a
doubtful
look
but
retreated
to
the
spot
i
had
mentioned
and
whether
it
was
the
rustle
of
her
silk
dress
or
whether
the
dream
of
the
girl
we
were
watching
had
reached
its
climax
a
momentary
stir
took
place
in
the
outstretched
form
before
me
and
next
moment
she
was
flinging
up
her
hands
with
a
cry
o
how
can
i
touch
her
she
is
dead
and
i
have
never
touched
a
dead
body
i
fell
back
breathing
hard
and
miss
althorpe
eyes
meeting
mine
grew
dark
with
horror
indeed
she
was
about
to
utter
a
cry
herself
but
i
made
an
imperative
motion
and
she
merely
shrank
farther
away
towards
the
door
meantime
i
had
bent
forward
and
laid
my
hand
on
the
trembling
figure
before
me
miss
oliver
i
said
rouse
yourself
i
pray
i
have
a
message
for
you
from
mrs
desberger
she
turned
her
head
looked
at
me
like
a
person
in
a
daze
then
slowly
moved
and
sat
up
who
are
you
she
asked
surveying
me
and
the
space
about
her
with
eyes
which
seemed
to
take
in
nothing
till
they
lit
upon
miss
figure
standing
in
an
attitude
of
mingled
shame
and
sympathy
by
the
door
oh
miss
althorpe
she
entreated
i
pray
you
to
excuse
me
i
did
not
know
you
wanted
me
i
have
been
asleep
it
is
this
lady
who
wants
you
answered
miss
althorpe
she
is
a
friend
of
mine
and
one
in
whom
you
can
confide
confide
this
was
a
word
to
rouse
her
she
turned
livid
and
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
my
way
both
terror
and
surprise
were
visible
why
should
you
think
i
had
anything
to
confide
if
i
had
i
should
not
pass
by
you
miss
althorpe
for
another
there
were
tears
in
her
voice
and
i
had
to
remember
the
victim
just
laid
away
in
woodlawn
not
to
bestow
much
more
compassion
on
this
woman
than
she
rightfully
deserved
she
had
a
magnetic
voice
and
a
magnetic
presence
but
that
was
no
reason
why
i
should
forget
what
she
had
done
no
one
asks
for
your
confidence
i
protested
though
it
might
not
hurt
you
to
accept
a
friend
whenever
you
can
get
one
i
merely
wish
as
i
said
before
to
give
you
a
message
from
desberger
under
whose
roof
you
stayed
before
coming
here
i
am
obliged
to
you
she
responded
rising
to
her
feet
and
trembling
very
much
desberger
is
a
kind
woman
what
does
she
want
of
me
so
i
was
on
the
right
track
she
acknowledged
desberger
nothing
but
to
return
you
this
it
fell
out
of
your
pocket
while
you
were
dressing
and
i
handed
her
the
little
red
i
had
taken
from
the
van
burnams
front
room
she
looked
at
it
shrunk
violently
back
and
with
difficulty
prevented
herself
from
showing
the
full
depth
of
her
feelings
i
do
know
anything
about
it
it
is
not
mine
i
do
know
it
and
her
hair
stirred
on
her
forehead
as
she
gazed
at
the
small
object
lying
in
the
palm
of
my
hand
proving
to
me
that
she
saw
again
before
her
all
the
horrors
of
the
house
from
which
it
had
been
taken
who
are
she
suddenly
demanded
tearing
her
eyes
from
this
simple
little
cushion
and
fixing
them
wildly
on
my
face
desberger
never
sent
me
this
i
you
are
right
to
stop
there
i
interposed
and
then
paused
feeling
that
i
had
forced
a
situation
which
i
hardly
knew
how
to
handle
the
instant
pause
she
had
given
herself
seemed
to
restore
her
leaving
me
she
moved
towards
miss
althorpe
i
do
know
who
this
lady
is
said
she
or
what
her
errand
here
with
me
may
mean
but
i
hope
that
it
is
nothing
that
will
force
me
to
leave
this
house
which
is
my
only
refuge
miss
althorpe
too
greatly
prejudiced
in
favor
of
this
girl
to
hear
this
appeal
unmoved
notwithstanding
the
show
of
guilt
with
which
she
had
met
my
attack
smiled
faintly
as
she
answered
nothing
short
of
the
best
reasons
would
make
me
part
from
you
now
if
there
are
such
reasons
you
will
spare
me
the
pain
of
making
use
of
them
i
think
i
can
so
far
trust
you
miss
oliver
no
answer
the
young
girl
looked
as
if
she
could
not
speak
are
there
any
reasons
why
i
should
not
retain
you
in
my
house
miss
oliver
the
gentle
mistress
of
many
millions
went
on
if
there
are
you
will
not
wish
to
stay
i
know
when
you
consider
how
near
my
marriage
day
is
and
how
undisturbed
my
mind
should
be
by
any
cares
unattending
my
wedding
and
still
the
girl
was
silent
though
her
lips
moved
slightly
as
if
she
would
have
spoken
if
she
could
but
perhaps
you
are
only
unfortunate
suggested
miss
althorpe
with
an
almost
angelic
look
of
pity
i
do
often
see
angels
in
women
if
that
is
so
god
forbid
that
you
should
leave
my
protection
or
my
house
what
do
you
say
miss
oliver
that
you
are
god
messenger
to
me
burst
from
the
other
as
if
her
tongue
had
been
suddenly
loosed
that
misfortune
and
not
wickedness
has
driven
me
to
your
doors
and
that
there
is
no
reason
why
i
should
leave
you
unless
my
secret
sufferings
make
my
presence
unwelcome
to
you
was
this
the
talk
of
a
frivolous
woman
caught
unawares
in
the
meshes
of
a
fearful
crime
if
so
she
was
a
more
accomplished
actress
than
we
had
been
led
to
expect
even
from
her
own
words
to
her
disgusted
husband
you
look
like
one
accustomed
to
tell
the
truth
proceeded
miss
althorpe
do
you
not
think
you
have
made
some
mistake
miss
butterworth
she
asked
approaching
me
with
an
ingenuous
smile
i
had
forgotten
to
caution
her
not
to
make
use
of
my
name
and
when
it
fell
from
her
lips
i
looked
to
see
her
unhappy
companion
recoil
from
me
with
a
scream
but
strange
to
say
she
evinced
no
emotion
and
seeing
this
i
became
more
distrustful
of
her
than
ever
for
for
her
to
hear
without
apparent
interest
the
name
of
the
chief
witness
in
the
inquest
which
had
been
held
over
the
remains
of
the
woman
with
whose
death
she
had
been
more
or
less
intimately
concerned
argued
powers
of
duplicity
such
as
are
only
associated
with
guilt
or
an
extreme
simplicity
of
character
and
she
was
not
simple
as
the
least
glance
from
her
deep
eyes
amply
showed
recognizing
therefore
that
open
measures
would
not
do
with
this
woman
i
changed
my
manner
at
once
and
responding
to
miss
althorpe
with
a
gracious
smile
remarked
with
an
air
of
sudden
conviction
perhaps
i
have
made
some
mistake
miss
oliver
words
sound
very
ingenuous
and
i
am
disposed
if
you
are
to
take
her
at
her
word
it
is
so
easy
to
draw
false
conclusions
in
this
world
and
i
put
back
the
into
my
pocket
with
an
air
of
being
through
with
the
matter
which
seemed
to
impose
upon
the
young
woman
for
she
smiled
faintly
showing
a
row
of
splendid
teeth
as
she
did
so
let
me
apologize
i
went
on
if
i
have
intruded
upon
miss
oliver
against
her
wishes
and
with
one
comprehensive
look
about
the
room
which
took
in
all
that
was
visible
of
her
simple
wardrobe
and
humble
belongings
i
led
the
way
out
miss
althorpe
immediately
followed
this
is
a
much
more
serious
affair
than
i
have
led
you
to
suppose
i
confided
to
her
as
soon
as
we
were
at
a
suitable
distance
from
miss
oliver
door
if
she
is
the
person
i
think
her
she
is
amenable
to
law
and
the
police
will
have
to
be
notified
of
her
whereabouts
she
stolen
then
her
fault
is
a
very
grave
one
i
returned
miss
althorpe
deeply
troubled
looked
about
her
as
if
for
guidance
i
who
could
have
given
it
to
her
made
no
movement
to
attract
her
attention
to
myself
but
waited
calmly
for
her
own
decision
in
this
matter
i
wish
you
would
let
me
consult
stone
she
ventured
at
last
i
think
his
judgment
might
help
us
i
had
rather
take
no
one
into
our
confidence
especially
no
man
he
would
consider
your
welfare
only
and
not
hers
i
did
not
consider
myself
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
the
work
upon
which
i
was
engaged
could
not
be
shared
by
one
of
the
male
sex
without
lessening
my
triumph
over
gryce
stone
is
very
just
she
remarked
but
he
might
be
biased
in
a
matter
of
this
kind
what
way
do
you
see
out
of
the
difficulty
only
this
to
settle
at
once
and
unmistakably
whether
she
is
the
person
who
carried
certain
articles
from
the
house
of
a
friend
of
mine
if
she
is
there
will
be
some
evidence
of
the
fact
visible
in
her
room
or
on
her
person
she
has
not
been
out
i
believe
not
since
she
came
into
the
house
and
has
remained
for
the
most
part
in
her
own
apartment
always
except
when
i
have
summoned
her
to
my
assistance
then
what
i
want
to
know
i
can
learn
there
but
how
can
i
make
my
investigations
without
offence
what
do
you
want
to
know
miss
butterworth
whether
she
has
in
her
keeping
some
half
dozen
rings
of
considerable
value
oh
she
could
conceal
rings
so
easily
she
does
conceal
them
i
have
no
more
doubt
of
it
than
i
have
of
my
standing
here
but
i
must
know
it
before
i
shall
feel
ready
to
call
the
attention
of
the
police
to
her
yes
we
should
both
know
it
poor
girl
poor
girl
to
be
suspected
of
a
crime
how
great
must
have
been
her
temptation
can
manage
this
matter
miss
althorpe
if
you
will
entrust
it
to
me
how
miss
butterworth
the
girl
is
ill
let
me
take
care
of
her
really
ill
yes
or
will
be
so
before
morning
there
is
fever
in
her
veins
she
has
worried
herself
oh
i
will
be
good
to
her
this
in
answer
to
a
doubtful
look
from
miss
althorpe
this
is
a
difficult
problem
you
have
set
me
that
lady
remarked
after
a
moment
thought
but
anything
seems
better
than
sending
her
away
or
sending
for
the
police
but
do
you
suppose
she
will
allow
you
in
her
room
i
think
so
if
her
fever
increases
she
will
not
notice
much
that
goes
on
about
her
and
i
think
it
will
increase
i
have
seen
enough
of
sickness
to
be
something
of
a
judge
and
you
will
search
her
while
she
is
unconscious
do
look
so
horrified
miss
althorpe
i
have
promised
you
i
will
not
worry
her
she
may
need
assistance
in
getting
to
bed
while
i
am
giving
it
to
her
i
can
judge
if
there
is
anything
concealed
upon
her
person
yes
perhaps
at
all
events
we
shall
know
more
than
we
do
now
shall
i
venture
miss
althorpe
i
can
not
say
no
was
the
hesitating
answer
you
seem
so
very
much
in
earnest
and
i
am
in
earnest
i
have
reasons
for
being
consideration
for
you
is
one
of
them
i
do
not
doubt
it
and
now
will
you
come
down
to
supper
miss
butterworth
no
i
replied
my
duty
is
here
only
send
word
to
lena
that
she
is
to
drive
home
and
take
care
of
my
house
in
my
absence
i
shall
want
nothing
so
do
not
worry
about
me
join
your
lover
now
dear
and
do
not
bestow
another
thought
upon
this
miss
oliver
or
what
i
am
about
to
do
in
her
room
xxiv
a
house
of
cards
i
did
not
return
immediately
to
my
patient
i
waited
till
her
supper
came
up
then
i
took
the
tray
and
assured
by
the
face
of
the
girl
who
brought
it
that
miss
althorpe
had
explained
my
presence
in
her
house
sufficiently
for
me
to
feel
at
my
ease
before
her
servants
i
carried
in
the
dainty
repast
she
had
provided
and
set
it
down
on
the
table
the
poor
woman
was
standing
where
we
had
left
her
but
her
whole
figure
showed
languor
and
she
more
than
leaned
against
the
bedpost
behind
her
as
i
looked
up
from
the
tray
and
met
her
eyes
she
shuddered
and
seemed
to
be
endeavoring
to
understand
who
i
was
and
what
i
was
doing
in
her
room
my
premonitions
in
regard
to
her
were
well
based
she
was
in
a
raging
fever
and
was
already
more
than
half
oblivious
to
her
surroundings
approaching
her
i
spoke
as
gently
as
i
could
for
her
hapless
condition
appealed
to
me
in
spite
of
my
well
founded
prejudices
against
her
and
seeing
she
was
growing
incapable
of
response
i
drew
her
up
on
the
bed
and
began
to
undress
her
i
half
expected
her
to
recoil
at
this
or
at
least
to
make
some
show
of
alarm
but
she
submitted
to
my
ministrations
almost
gratefully
and
neither
shrank
nor
questioned
me
till
i
laid
my
hands
upon
her
shoes
then
indeed
she
quivered
and
drew
her
feet
away
with
such
an
appearance
of
terror
that
i
was
forced
to
desist
from
my
efforts
or
drive
her
into
violent
delirium
this
satisfied
me
that
louise
van
burnam
lay
before
me
the
scar
concerning
which
so
much
had
been
said
in
the
papers
would
be
ever
present
in
the
thoughts
of
this
woman
as
the
mark
by
which
she
might
be
known
and
though
at
this
moment
she
was
on
the
borders
of
unconsciousness
the
instinct
of
still
remained
in
sufficient
force
to
prompt
her
to
make
this
effort
to
protect
herself
from
discovery
i
had
told
miss
althorpe
that
my
chief
reason
for
intruding
upon
miss
oliver
was
to
determine
if
she
had
in
her
possession
certain
rings
supposed
to
have
been
taken
from
a
friend
of
mine
and
while
this
was
in
a
measure
true
the
rings
being
an
important
factor
in
the
proof
i
was
accumulating
against
her
i
was
not
so
anxious
to
search
for
them
at
this
time
as
to
find
the
scar
which
would
settle
at
once
the
question
of
her
identity
when
she
drew
her
foot
away
from
me
then
so
violently
i
saw
that
i
needed
to
search
no
farther
for
the
evidence
required
and
could
give
myself
up
to
making
her
comfortable
so
i
bathed
her
temples
now
throbbing
with
heat
and
soon
had
the
satisfaction
of
seeing
her
fall
into
a
deep
and
uneasy
slumber
then
i
tried
again
to
draw
off
her
shoes
but
the
start
she
gave
and
the
smothered
cry
which
escaped
her
warned
me
that
i
must
wait
yet
longer
before
satisfying
my
curiosity
so
i
desisted
at
once
and
out
of
pure
compassion
left
her
to
get
what
good
she
might
from
the
lethargy
into
which
she
had
fallen
being
hungry
or
at
least
feeling
the
necessity
of
some
slight
aliment
to
help
me
sustain
the
fatigues
of
the
night
i
sat
down
now
at
the
table
and
partook
of
some
of
the
dainties
with
which
miss
althorpe
had
kindly
provided
me
after
which
i
made
out
a
list
of
such
articles
as
were
necessary
to
my
proper
care
of
the
patient
who
had
so
strangely
fallen
into
my
hands
and
then
feeling
that
i
had
a
right
at
last
to
indulge
in
pure
curiosity
i
turned
my
attention
to
the
clothing
i
had
taken
from
the
miss
oliver
the
dress
was
a
simple
gray
one
and
the
skirts
and
underclothing
all
white
but
the
latter
was
of
the
finest
texture
and
convinced
me
before
i
had
given
them
more
than
a
glance
that
they
were
the
property
of
howard
van
burnam
wife
for
besides
the
exquisite
quality
of
the
material
there
were
to
be
seen
on
the
edges
of
the
bands
and
sleeves
the
marks
of
stitches
and
clinging
threads
of
lace
where
the
trimming
had
been
torn
off
and
in
one
article
especially
there
were
tucks
such
as
you
see
come
from
the
hands
of
french
needlewomen
only
this
taken
with
what
had
gone
before
was
proof
enough
to
satisfy
me
that
i
was
on
the
right
track
and
after
crescenze
had
come
and
gone
with
the
tray
and
all
was
quiet
in
this
remote
part
of
the
house
i
ventured
to
open
a
closet
door
at
the
foot
of
the
bed
a
brown
silk
skirt
was
hanging
within
and
in
the
pocket
of
that
skirt
i
found
a
purse
so
gay
and
costly
that
all
doubt
vanished
as
to
its
being
the
property
of
howard
luxurious
wife
there
were
several
bills
in
this
purse
amounting
to
about
fifteen
dollars
in
money
but
no
change
and
no
memoranda
which
latter
seemed
a
pity
restoring
the
purse
to
its
place
and
the
skirt
to
its
peg
i
came
softly
back
to
the
bedside
and
examined
my
patient
still
more
carefully
than
i
had
done
before
she
was
asleep
and
breathing
heavily
but
even
with
this
disadvantage
her
face
had
its
own
attraction
an
attraction
which
evidently
had
more
or
less
influenced
men
and
which
for
the
reason
perhaps
that
i
have
something
masculine
in
my
nature
i
discovered
to
be
more
or
less
influencing
me
notwithstanding
my
hatred
of
an
intriguing
character
however
it
was
not
her
beauty
i
came
to
study
but
her
hair
her
complexion
and
her
hands
the
former
was
brown
the
brown
of
that
same
lock
i
remembered
to
have
seen
in
the
jury
hands
at
the
inquest
and
her
skin
where
fever
had
not
flushed
it
was
white
and
smooth
so
were
her
hands
and
yet
they
were
not
a
lady
hands
that
i
noticed
when
i
first
saw
her
the
marks
of
the
rings
she
no
longer
wore
were
not
enough
to
blind
me
to
the
fact
that
her
fingers
lacked
the
distinctive
shape
and
nicety
of
miss
althorpe
say
or
even
of
the
misses
van
burnam
and
though
i
do
not
object
to
this
for
i
like
capable
hands
myself
they
served
to
help
me
understand
the
face
which
otherwise
would
have
looked
too
spiritual
for
a
woman
of
the
peevish
and
character
of
louise
van
burnam
on
this
innocent
and
appealing
expression
she
had
traded
in
her
short
and
none
too
happy
career
and
as
i
noted
it
i
recalled
a
sentence
in
miss
testimony
in
which
she
alluded
to
van
burnam
confidential
remark
to
her
husband
upon
the
power
she
exercised
over
people
when
she
raised
her
eyes
in
entreaty
towards
them
am
i
not
pretty
she
had
said
when
i
am
in
distress
and
looking
up
in
this
way
it
was
the
suggestion
of
a
scheming
woman
but
from
what
i
had
seen
and
was
seeing
of
the
woman
before
me
i
could
imagine
the
picture
she
would
thus
make
and
i
do
not
think
she
overrated
its
effects
withdrawing
from
her
side
once
more
i
made
a
tour
of
the
room
nothing
escaped
my
eyes
nothing
was
too
small
to
engage
my
attention
but
while
i
failed
to
see
anything
calculated
to
shake
my
confidence
in
the
conclusions
i
had
come
to
i
saw
but
little
to
confirm
them
this
was
not
strange
for
apart
from
a
few
toilet
articles
and
some
on
a
shelf
she
appeared
to
have
no
belongings
everything
else
in
sight
being
manifestly
the
property
of
miss
althorpe
even
the
bureau
drawers
were
empty
and
her
bag
found
under
a
small
table
had
not
so
much
in
it
as
a
though
i
searched
it
inside
and
out
for
her
rings
which
i
was
positive
she
had
with
her
even
if
she
dared
not
wear
them
when
every
spot
was
exhausted
i
sat
down
and
began
to
brood
over
what
lay
before
this
poor
being
whose
flight
and
the
great
efforts
she
made
at
concealment
proved
only
too
conclusively
the
fatal
part
she
had
played
in
the
crime
for
which
her
husband
had
been
arrested
i
had
reached
her
arraignment
before
a
magistrate
and
was
already
imagining
her
face
with
the
appeal
in
it
which
such
an
occasion
would
call
forth
when
there
came
a
low
knock
at
the
door
and
miss
althorpe
she
had
just
said
to
her
lover
and
her
face
recalled
to
me
a
time
when
my
own
cheek
was
round
and
my
eye
was
bright
and
well
what
is
the
use
of
dwelling
on
matters
so
long
buried
in
oblivion
a
as
independent
as
myself
need
not
envy
any
girl
the
doubtful
blessing
of
a
husband
i
chose
to
be
independent
and
i
am
and
what
more
is
there
to
be
said
about
it
pardon
the
digression
is
miss
oliver
any
better
asked
miss
althorpe
and
have
you
found
i
put
up
my
finger
in
warning
of
all
things
it
was
most
necessary
that
the
sick
woman
should
not
know
my
real
reason
for
being
there
she
is
asleep
i
answered
quietly
and
i
i
have
found
out
what
is
the
matter
with
her
miss
althorpe
seemed
to
understand
she
cast
a
look
of
solicitude
towards
the
bed
and
then
turned
towards
me
i
can
not
rest
said
she
and
will
sit
with
you
for
a
little
while
if
you
do
mind
i
felt
the
implied
compliment
keenly
you
can
do
me
no
greater
favor
i
returned
she
drew
up
an
that
is
for
you
she
smiled
and
sat
down
in
a
little
low
rocker
at
my
side
but
she
did
not
talk
her
thoughts
seemed
to
have
recurred
to
some
very
near
and
sweet
memory
for
she
smiled
softly
to
herself
and
looked
so
deeply
happy
that
i
could
not
resist
saying
these
are
delightful
days
for
you
miss
althorpe
she
sighed
softly
how
much
a
sigh
can
reveal
and
looked
up
at
me
brightly
i
think
she
was
glad
i
spoke
even
such
reserved
natures
as
hers
have
their
moments
of
weakness
and
she
had
no
mother
or
sister
to
appeal
to
yes
she
replied
i
am
very
happy
happier
than
most
girls
are
i
think
just
before
marriage
it
is
such
a
revelation
to
me
this
devotion
and
admiration
from
one
i
love
i
have
had
so
little
of
it
in
my
life
my
father
she
stopped
i
knew
why
she
stopped
i
gave
her
a
look
of
encouragement
people
have
always
been
anxious
for
my
happiness
and
have
warned
me
against
matrimony
since
i
was
old
enough
to
know
the
difference
between
poverty
and
wealth
before
i
was
out
of
short
dresses
i
was
warned
against
it
was
not
good
advice
it
has
stood
in
the
way
of
my
happiness
all
my
life
made
me
distrustful
and
unnaturally
reserved
but
now
ah
miss
butterworth
stone
is
so
estimable
a
man
so
brilliant
and
so
universally
admired
that
all
my
doubts
of
manly
worth
and
disinterestedness
have
disappeared
as
if
by
magic
i
trust
him
implicitly
and
do
i
talk
too
freely
do
you
object
to
such
confidences
as
these
on
the
contrary
i
answered
i
liked
miss
althorpe
so
much
and
agreed
with
her
so
thoroughly
in
her
opinion
of
this
man
that
it
was
a
real
pleasure
to
me
to
hear
her
speak
so
unreservedly
we
are
not
a
foolish
couple
she
went
on
warming
with
the
charm
of
her
topic
till
she
looked
beautiful
in
the
half
light
thrown
upon
her
by
the
shaded
lamp
we
are
interested
in
people
and
things
and
get
half
our
delight
from
the
perfect
congeniality
of
our
natures
stone
has
given
up
his
club
and
all
his
bachelor
pursuits
since
he
knew
me
and
o
love
if
at
any
time
in
my
life
i
have
despised
thee
i
did
not
despise
thee
then
the
look
with
which
she
finished
this
sentence
would
have
moved
a
cynic
forgive
me
she
prayed
it
is
the
first
time
i
have
poured
out
my
heart
to
any
one
of
my
own
sex
it
must
sound
strange
to
you
but
it
seemed
natural
while
i
was
doing
it
for
you
looked
as
if
you
could
understand
this
to
me
to
amelia
butterworth
of
whom
men
have
said
i
had
no
more
sentiment
than
a
wooden
image
i
looked
my
appreciation
and
she
blushing
slightly
whispered
in
a
delicious
tone
of
mingled
shyness
and
pride
only
two
weeks
now
and
i
shall
have
some
one
to
stand
between
me
and
the
world
have
never
needed
any
one
miss
butterworth
for
you
do
not
fear
the
world
but
it
awes
and
troubles
me
and
my
whole
heart
glows
with
the
thought
that
i
shall
be
no
longer
alone
in
my
sorrows
or
my
joys
my
perplexities
or
my
doubts
am
i
to
blame
for
anticipating
this
with
so
much
happiness
i
sighed
it
was
a
less
eloquent
sigh
than
hers
but
it
was
a
distinct
one
and
it
had
a
distinct
echo
lifting
my
eyes
for
i
sat
so
as
to
face
the
bed
i
was
startled
to
observe
my
patient
leaning
towards
us
from
her
pillows
and
staring
upon
us
with
eyes
too
hollow
for
tears
but
filled
with
unfathomable
grief
and
yearning
she
had
heard
this
talk
of
love
she
the
forsaken
and
one
i
shuddered
and
laid
my
hand
on
miss
althorpe
but
i
did
not
seek
to
stop
the
conversation
for
as
our
looks
met
the
sick
woman
fell
back
and
lapsed
or
seemed
to
lapse
into
immediate
insensibility
again
is
miss
oliver
worse
inquired
miss
althorpe
i
rose
and
went
to
the
bedside
renewed
the
bandages
on
my
head
and
forced
a
drop
or
two
of
medicine
between
her
lips
no
i
returned
i
think
her
fever
is
abating
and
it
was
though
the
suffering
on
her
face
was
yet
apparent
is
she
asleep
she
seems
to
be
miss
althorpe
made
an
effort
i
am
not
going
to
talk
any
more
about
myself
then
as
i
came
back
and
sat
down
by
her
side
she
quietly
asked
what
do
you
think
of
the
van
burnam
murder
dismayed
at
the
introduction
of
this
topic
i
was
about
to
put
my
hand
over
her
mouth
when
i
noticed
that
her
words
had
made
no
evident
impression
upon
my
patient
who
lay
quietly
and
with
a
more
composed
expression
than
when
i
left
her
bedside
this
assured
me
as
nothing
else
could
have
done
that
she
was
really
asleep
or
in
that
lethargic
state
which
closes
the
eyes
and
ears
to
what
is
going
on
i
think
said
i
that
the
young
man
howard
stands
in
a
very
unfortunate
position
circumstances
certainly
do
look
very
black
against
him
it
is
dreadful
unprecedently
dreadful
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
of
it
all
the
van
burnams
have
borne
so
good
a
name
and
franklin
especially
is
held
in
such
high
esteem
i
do
think
anything
more
shocking
has
ever
happened
in
this
city
do
you
miss
butterworth
you
saw
it
all
and
should
know
poor
poor
van
burnam
she
is
to
be
pitied
i
remarked
my
eyes
fixed
on
the
immovable
face
of
my
patient
when
i
heard
that
a
young
woman
had
been
found
dead
in
the
van
burnam
mansion
miss
althorpe
pursued
with
such
evident
interest
in
this
new
theme
that
i
did
not
care
to
interrupt
her
unless
driven
to
it
by
some
token
of
consciousness
on
the
part
of
my
patient
my
thoughts
flew
instinctively
to
howard
wife
though
why
i
can
not
say
for
i
never
had
any
reason
to
expect
so
tragic
a
termination
to
their
marriage
relations
and
i
can
not
believe
now
that
he
killed
her
can
you
miss
butterworth
howard
has
too
much
of
the
gentleman
in
him
to
do
a
brutal
thing
and
there
was
brutality
as
well
as
adroitness
in
the
perpetration
of
this
crime
have
you
thought
of
that
miss
butterworth
yes
i
nodded
i
have
looked
at
the
crime
on
all
sides
stone
said
she
feels
dreadfully
over
the
part
he
was
forced
to
play
at
the
inquest
but
he
had
no
choice
the
police
would
have
his
testimony
that
was
right
i
declared
it
has
made
us
doubly
anxious
to
have
howard
free
himself
but
he
does
not
seem
able
to
do
so
if
his
wife
had
only
known
was
there
a
quiver
in
the
lids
i
was
watching
i
half
raised
my
hand
and
then
i
let
it
drop
again
convinced
that
i
had
been
mistaken
miss
althorpe
at
once
continued
she
was
not
a
woman
only
vain
and
frivolous
she
had
set
her
heart
on
ruling
in
the
great
house
and
she
did
not
know
how
to
bear
her
disappointment
i
have
sympathy
for
her
myself
when
i
saw
her
saw
her
i
started
upsetting
a
small
at
my
side
which
for
once
i
did
not
stop
to
pick
up
you
have
seen
her
i
repeated
dropping
my
eyes
from
the
patient
to
fix
them
in
my
unbounded
astonishment
on
miss
althorpe
face
yes
more
than
once
she
was
if
she
were
living
i
would
not
repeat
this
a
nursery
governess
in
a
family
where
i
once
visited
that
was
before
her
marriage
before
she
had
met
either
howard
or
franklin
van
burnam
i
was
so
overwhelmed
that
for
once
i
found
difficulty
in
speaking
i
glanced
from
her
to
the
white
form
in
the
shrouded
bed
and
back
again
in
astonishment
and
dismay
you
have
seen
her
i
at
last
reiterated
in
what
i
meant
to
be
a
whisper
but
which
fell
little
short
of
being
a
cry
and
you
took
in
this
girl
her
surprise
at
this
burst
was
almost
equal
to
mine
yes
why
not
what
have
they
in
common
i
sank
back
my
house
of
cards
was
trembling
to
its
foundations
do
they
do
they
not
look
alike
i
gasped
i
thought
i
imagined
louise
van
burnam
look
like
that
girl
o
no
they
were
very
different
sort
of
women
what
made
you
think
there
was
any
resemblance
between
them
i
did
not
answer
her
the
structure
i
had
reared
with
such
care
and
circumspection
had
fallen
about
my
ears
and
i
lay
gasping
under
the
ruins
xxv
the
rings
where
are
the
rings
had
gryce
been
present
i
would
have
instantly
triumphed
over
my
disappointment
bottled
up
my
chagrin
and
been
the
inscrutable
amelia
butterworth
before
he
could
say
something
has
gone
wrong
with
this
woman
but
gryce
was
not
present
and
though
i
did
not
betray
the
half
i
felt
i
yet
showed
enough
emotion
for
miss
althorpe
to
remark
you
seemed
surprised
by
what
i
have
told
you
has
any
one
said
that
these
two
women
were
alike
having
to
speak
i
became
myself
again
in
a
trice
and
nodded
vigorously
some
one
was
so
foolish
i
remarked
miss
althorpe
looked
thoughtful
while
she
was
interested
she
was
not
so
interested
as
to
take
the
subject
in
fully
her
own
concerns
made
her
abstracted
and
i
was
very
glad
of
it
louise
van
burnam
had
a
sharp
chin
and
a
very
cold
blue
eye
yet
her
face
was
a
fascinating
one
to
some
well
it
was
a
dreadful
tragedy
i
observed
and
tried
to
turn
the
subject
aside
which
fortunately
i
was
able
to
do
after
a
short
effort
then
i
picked
the
basket
up
and
perceiving
the
sick
woman
lips
faintly
moving
i
went
over
to
her
and
found
her
murmuring
to
herself
as
miss
althorpe
had
risen
when
i
did
i
did
not
dare
to
listen
to
these
murmurs
but
when
my
charming
hostess
had
bidden
me
with
many
injunctions
not
to
tire
myself
and
to
be
sure
and
remember
that
a
decanter
and
a
plate
of
biscuits
stood
on
a
table
outside
i
hastened
back
to
the
bedside
and
leaning
over
my
patient
endeavored
to
catch
the
words
as
they
fell
from
her
lips
as
they
were
simple
and
but
the
echo
of
those
running
at
that
very
moment
through
my
own
brain
i
had
no
difficulty
in
distinguishing
them
van
burnam
she
was
saying
van
burnam
varied
by
a
short
howard
and
once
by
a
doubtful
franklin
ah
thought
i
with
a
sudden
reaction
she
is
the
woman
i
seek
if
she
is
not
louise
van
burnam
and
unheeding
the
start
she
gave
i
pulled
off
the
blanket
i
had
spread
over
her
and
drew
off
her
left
shoe
and
stocking
her
bare
ankle
showed
no
scar
and
covering
it
quickly
up
i
took
up
her
shoe
immediately
the
trepidation
she
had
shown
at
the
approach
of
a
stranger
hand
towards
that
article
of
clothing
was
explained
in
the
lining
around
the
top
were
sewn
bills
of
no
ordinary
amount
and
as
the
other
shoe
was
probably
used
as
a
like
depository
she
naturally
felt
concern
at
any
approach
which
might
lead
to
a
discovery
of
her
little
fortune
amazed
at
a
mystery
possessing
so
many
points
of
interest
i
tucked
the
shoe
in
under
the
bedclothes
and
sat
down
to
review
the
situation
the
mistake
i
had
made
was
in
concluding
that
because
the
fugitive
whose
traces
i
had
followed
had
worn
the
clothes
of
louise
van
burnam
she
must
necessarily
be
that
unfortunate
lady
now
i
saw
that
the
murdered
woman
was
howard
wife
after
all
and
this
patient
of
mine
her
probable
rival
but
this
necessitated
an
entire
change
in
my
whole
line
of
reasoning
if
the
rival
and
not
the
wife
lay
before
me
then
which
of
the
two
accompanied
him
to
the
scene
of
tragedy
he
had
said
it
was
his
wife
i
had
proven
to
myself
that
it
was
the
rival
was
he
right
or
was
i
right
or
were
neither
of
us
right
not
being
able
to
decide
i
fixed
my
mind
upon
another
query
when
did
the
two
women
exchange
clothes
or
rather
when
did
this
woman
procure
the
silk
habiliments
and
elaborate
adornments
of
her
more
opulent
rival
was
it
before
either
of
them
entered
van
burnam
house
or
was
it
after
their
encounter
there
running
over
in
my
mind
certain
little
facts
of
which
i
had
hitherto
attempted
no
explanation
i
grouped
them
together
and
sought
amongst
them
for
inspiration
these
are
the
facts
one
of
the
garments
found
on
the
murdered
woman
had
been
torn
down
the
back
as
it
was
a
new
one
it
had
evidently
been
subjected
to
some
quick
strain
not
explainable
by
any
appearance
of
struggle
the
shoes
and
stockings
found
on
the
victim
were
the
only
articles
she
wore
which
could
not
be
traced
back
to
altman
in
the
of
the
james
pope
these
articles
had
not
been
changed
could
not
that
fact
be
explained
by
the
presence
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
in
her
shoes
the
going
out
bareheaded
of
a
fugitive
anxious
to
avoid
observation
leaving
hat
and
gloves
behind
her
in
a
closet
i
had
endeavored
to
explain
this
last
anomalous
action
by
her
fear
of
being
traced
by
so
conspicuous
an
article
as
this
hat
but
it
was
not
a
satisfactory
explanation
to
me
then
and
much
less
so
now
and
last
and
most
vital
of
all
the
words
which
i
had
heard
fall
from
this
girl
how
can
i
touch
her
she
is
dead
and
i
have
never
touched
a
dead
body
could
inspiration
fail
me
before
such
a
list
was
it
not
evident
that
the
change
had
been
made
after
death
and
by
this
seemingly
sensitive
girl
own
hands
it
was
a
horrible
thought
and
led
to
others
more
horrible
for
the
very
commission
of
such
a
revolting
act
argued
a
desire
for
concealment
only
to
be
explained
by
great
guilt
she
had
been
the
offender
and
the
wife
the
victim
and
howard
well
his
actions
continued
to
be
a
mystery
but
i
would
not
admit
his
guilt
even
now
on
the
contrary
i
saw
his
innocence
in
a
still
stronger
light
for
if
he
had
openly
or
even
covertly
connived
at
his
wife
death
would
he
have
so
immediately
forsaken
the
accomplice
of
his
guilt
to
say
nothing
of
leaving
to
her
the
dreadful
task
of
concealing
the
crime
no
i
would
rather
think
that
the
tragedy
took
place
after
his
departure
and
that
his
action
in
denying
his
wife
identity
as
long
as
it
was
possible
to
do
so
was
to
be
explained
by
the
fact
of
his
ignorance
in
regard
to
his
presence
in
the
house
where
he
had
supposed
himself
to
have
simply
left
her
rival
as
the
exchange
made
in
the
clothing
worn
by
the
two
women
could
only
have
taken
place
later
and
as
he
naturally
judged
the
victim
by
her
clothing
perhaps
he
was
really
deceived
himself
as
to
her
identity
it
was
certainly
not
an
improbable
supposition
and
accounted
for
much
that
was
otherwise
inexplicable
in
van
burnam
conduct
but
the
rings
why
could
i
not
find
the
rings
if
my
present
reasoning
were
correct
this
woman
should
have
those
evidences
of
guilt
about
her
but
had
i
not
searched
for
them
in
every
available
place
without
success
annoyed
at
my
failure
to
fix
this
one
irrefutable
proof
of
guilt
upon
her
i
took
up
the
i
saw
in
miss
basket
and
began
to
ply
the
needles
by
way
of
relief
to
my
thoughts
but
i
had
no
sooner
got
well
under
way
than
some
movement
on
the
part
of
my
patient
drew
my
attention
again
to
the
bed
and
i
was
startled
by
beholding
her
sitting
up
again
but
this
time
with
a
look
of
fear
rather
than
of
suffering
on
her
features
do
she
gasped
pointing
with
an
unsteady
hand
at
the
work
in
my
hand
the
click
click
of
the
needles
is
more
than
i
can
stand
put
them
down
pray
put
them
down
her
agitation
was
so
great
and
her
nervousness
so
apparent
that
i
complied
at
once
however
much
i
might
be
affected
by
her
guilt
i
was
not
willing
to
do
the
slightest
thing
to
worry
her
nerves
even
at
the
expense
of
my
own
as
the
needles
fell
from
my
hand
she
sank
back
and
a
quick
short
sigh
escaped
her
lips
then
she
was
again
quiet
and
i
allowed
my
thoughts
to
return
to
the
old
theme
the
rings
the
rings
where
were
the
rings
and
was
it
impossible
for
me
to
find
them
xxvi
a
tilt
with
gryce
at
seven
the
next
morning
my
patient
was
resting
so
quietly
that
i
considered
it
safe
to
leave
her
for
a
short
time
so
i
informed
miss
althorpe
that
i
was
obliged
to
go
on
an
important
errand
and
requested
crescenze
to
watch
over
the
sick
girl
in
my
absence
as
she
agreed
to
this
i
left
the
house
as
soon
as
breakfast
was
over
and
went
immediately
in
search
of
gryce
i
wished
to
make
sure
that
he
knew
nothing
about
the
rings
it
was
eleven
before
i
succeeded
in
finding
him
as
i
was
certain
that
a
direct
question
would
bring
no
answer
i
dissembled
my
real
intention
as
much
as
my
principles
would
allow
and
accosted
him
with
the
eager
look
of
one
who
has
great
news
to
impart
o
mr
gryce
i
impetuously
cried
just
as
if
i
were
really
the
weak
woman
he
thought
me
i
have
found
something
something
in
connection
with
the
van
burnam
murder
you
know
i
promised
to
busy
myself
about
it
if
you
arrested
howard
van
burnam
his
smile
was
tantalizing
in
the
extreme
found
something
he
repeated
and
may
i
ask
if
you
have
been
so
good
as
to
bring
it
with
you
he
was
playing
with
me
this
aged
and
reputable
detective
i
subdued
my
anger
subdued
my
indignation
even
and
smiling
much
in
his
own
way
answered
briefly
i
never
carry
valuables
on
my
person
a
expensive
rings
stand
for
too
much
money
for
me
to
run
any
undue
risk
with
them
he
was
caressing
his
as
i
spoke
and
i
noticed
that
he
paused
in
this
action
for
just
an
infinitesimal
length
of
time
as
i
said
the
word
rings
then
he
went
on
as
before
but
i
knew
i
had
caught
his
attention
of
what
rings
do
you
speak
madam
of
those
missing
from
van
burnam
hands
i
took
a
leaf
from
his
book
and
allowed
myself
to
indulge
in
a
little
banter
o
no
i
remonstrated
not
those
rings
of
course
the
queen
of
siam
rings
any
rings
but
those
in
which
we
are
specially
interested
this
meeting
him
on
his
own
ground
evidently
puzzled
him
you
are
facetious
madam
what
am
i
to
gather
from
such
levity
that
success
has
crowned
your
efforts
and
that
you
have
found
a
guiltier
party
than
the
one
now
in
custody
possibly
i
returned
limiting
my
advance
by
his
but
it
would
be
going
too
fast
to
mention
that
yet
what
i
want
to
know
is
whether
have
found
the
rings
belonging
to
van
burnam
my
triumphant
tone
the
almost
mocking
accent
i
purposely
gave
to
the
word
accomplished
its
purpose
he
never
dreamed
i
was
playing
with
him
he
thought
i
was
bursting
with
pride
and
casting
me
a
sharp
glance
the
first
by
the
way
i
had
received
from
him
he
inquired
with
perceptible
interest
have
instantly
convinced
that
the
whereabouts
of
these
jewels
was
as
little
known
to
him
as
to
me
i
rose
and
prepared
to
leave
but
seeing
that
he
was
not
satisfied
and
that
he
expected
an
answer
i
assumed
a
mysterious
air
and
quietly
remarked
if
you
will
come
to
my
house
i
will
explain
myself
i
am
not
prepared
to
more
than
intimate
my
discoveries
but
he
was
not
the
man
to
let
one
off
so
easily
excuse
me
said
he
but
matters
of
this
kind
do
not
admit
of
delay
the
grand
jury
sits
within
the
week
and
any
evidence
worth
presenting
them
must
be
collected
at
once
i
must
ask
you
to
be
frank
with
me
miss
butterworth
and
i
will
be
he
insisted
seeing
that
i
should
gain
nothing
by
my
present
course
i
reseated
myself
bestowing
upon
him
a
decidedly
ambiguous
smile
as
i
did
so
you
acknowledge
then
said
i
that
the
old
maid
can
tell
you
something
after
all
i
thought
you
regarded
all
my
efforts
in
the
light
of
a
jest
what
has
made
you
change
your
mind
madam
i
decline
to
bandy
words
have
you
found
those
rings
or
have
you
not
i
have
said
i
but
neither
have
you
and
as
that
is
what
i
wanted
to
make
sure
of
i
will
now
take
my
leave
without
further
ceremony
gryce
is
not
a
profane
man
but
he
allowed
a
word
to
slip
from
him
which
was
not
entirely
one
of
blessing
he
made
amends
for
it
next
moment
however
by
remarking
madam
i
once
said
as
you
will
doubtless
remember
that
the
day
would
come
when
i
should
find
myself
at
your
feet
that
day
has
arrived
and
now
is
there
any
other
little
cherished
fact
known
to
the
police
which
you
would
like
to
have
imparted
to
you
i
took
his
humiliation
seriously
you
are
very
good
i
rejoined
but
i
will
not
trouble
you
for
any
i
am
enabled
to
glean
for
myself
but
what
i
should
like
you
to
tell
me
is
this
whether
if
you
came
upon
those
rings
in
the
possession
of
a
person
known
to
have
been
on
the
scene
of
crime
at
the
time
of
its
perpetration
you
would
not
consider
them
as
an
incontrovertible
proof
of
guilt
undoubtedly
said
he
with
a
sudden
alteration
in
his
manner
which
warned
me
that
i
must
muster
up
all
my
strength
if
i
would
keep
my
secret
till
i
was
quite
ready
to
part
with
it
then
said
i
with
a
resolute
movement
towards
the
door
that
the
whole
of
my
business
for
gryce
i
shall
expect
you
he
made
me
stop
though
my
foot
had
crossed
the
threshold
not
by
word
or
look
but
simply
by
his
fatherly
manner
miss
butterworth
he
observed
the
suspicions
which
you
have
entertained
from
the
first
have
within
the
last
few
days
assumed
a
definite
form
in
what
direction
do
they
point
tell
me
some
men
and
most
women
would
have
yielded
to
that
imperative
but
there
was
no
yielding
in
amelia
butterworth
instead
of
that
i
treated
him
to
a
touch
of
irony
is
it
possible
i
asked
that
you
think
it
worth
while
to
consult
i
thought
your
eyes
were
too
keen
to
seek
assistance
from
mine
you
are
as
confident
as
i
am
that
howard
van
burnam
is
innocent
of
the
crime
for
which
you
have
arrested
him
a
look
that
was
dangerously
insinuating
crossed
his
face
at
this
he
came
forward
rapidly
and
joining
me
where
i
stood
said
smilingly
let
us
join
forces
miss
butterworth
you
have
from
the
first
refused
to
consider
the
younger
son
of
silas
van
burnam
as
guilty
your
reasons
then
were
slight
and
hardly
worth
communicating
have
you
any
better
ones
to
advance
now
it
is
not
too
late
to
mention
them
if
you
have
it
will
not
be
too
late
i
retorted
convinced
that
i
was
not
to
be
moved
from
my
position
he
gave
me
one
of
his
low
bows
i
forgot
said
he
that
it
was
as
a
rival
and
not
as
a
coadjutor
you
meddled
in
this
matter
and
he
bowed
again
this
time
with
a
sarcastic
air
i
felt
too
to
resent
then
said
i
at
that
i
left
him
i
did
not
return
immediately
to
miss
althorpe
i
visited
cox
millinery
store
desberger
house
and
the
offices
of
the
various
city
railways
but
i
got
no
clue
to
the
rings
and
finally
satisfied
that
miss
oliver
as
i
must
now
call
her
had
not
lost
or
disposed
of
them
on
her
way
from
gramercy
park
to
her
present
place
of
refuge
i
returned
to
miss
althorpe
with
even
a
greater
determination
than
before
to
search
that
luxurious
home
till
i
found
them
but
a
decided
surprise
awaited
me
as
the
door
opened
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
the
butler
face
and
noticing
its
embarrassed
expression
i
at
once
asked
what
had
happened
his
answer
showed
a
strange
mixture
of
hesitation
and
bravado
not
much
only
miss
althorpe
is
afraid
you
may
not
be
pleased
miss
oliver
is
gone
she
ran
away
while
crescenze
was
out
of
the
room
xxvii
found
i
gave
a
low
cry
and
rushed
down
the
steps
do
go
i
called
out
to
the
driver
i
shall
want
you
in
ten
minutes
and
hurrying
back
i
ran
in
a
condition
of
mind
such
as
i
have
no
reason
to
be
proud
of
happily
gryce
was
not
there
to
see
me
gone
miss
oliver
gone
i
cried
to
the
maid
whom
i
found
trembling
in
a
corner
of
the
hall
yes
it
was
my
fault
she
was
in
bed
so
quiet
i
thought
i
might
step
out
for
a
minute
but
when
i
came
back
her
clothes
were
missing
and
she
was
gone
she
must
have
slipped
out
at
the
front
door
while
dan
was
in
the
back
hall
i
do
see
how
ever
she
had
the
strength
to
do
it
nor
did
i
but
i
did
not
stop
to
reason
about
it
there
was
too
much
to
be
done
rushing
on
i
entered
the
room
i
had
left
in
such
high
hopes
a
few
hours
before
emptiness
was
before
me
and
i
realized
what
it
was
to
be
baffled
at
the
moment
of
success
but
i
did
not
waste
an
instant
in
inactivity
i
searched
the
closets
and
pulled
open
the
drawers
found
her
coat
and
hat
gone
but
not
van
burnam
brown
skirt
though
the
purse
had
been
taken
out
of
the
pocket
is
her
bag
here
i
asked
yes
it
was
in
its
old
place
under
the
table
and
on
the
and
bureau
were
the
simple
toilet
articles
i
had
been
told
she
had
brought
there
in
what
haste
she
must
have
fled
to
leave
these
necessities
behind
her
but
the
greatest
shock
i
received
was
the
sight
of
the
with
which
i
had
so
inconsiderately
meddled
the
evening
before
lying
in
ravelled
heaps
on
the
table
as
if
torn
to
bits
in
a
frenzy
this
was
a
proof
that
the
fever
was
yet
on
her
and
as
i
contemplated
this
fact
i
took
courage
thinking
that
one
in
her
condition
would
not
be
allowed
to
run
the
streets
long
but
would
be
picked
up
and
put
in
some
hospital
in
this
hope
i
began
my
search
miss
althorpe
who
came
in
just
as
i
was
about
to
leave
the
house
consented
to
telephone
to
police
headquarters
a
description
of
the
girl
with
a
request
to
be
notified
if
such
a
person
should
be
found
in
the
streets
or
on
the
docks
or
at
any
of
the
that
night
not
i
assured
her
as
we
left
the
telephone
and
i
prepared
to
say
for
the
day
that
you
need
expect
her
to
be
brought
back
to
this
house
for
i
do
not
mean
that
she
shall
ever
darken
your
doors
again
so
let
me
know
if
they
find
her
and
i
will
relieve
you
of
all
further
responsibility
in
the
matter
then
i
started
out
to
name
the
streets
i
traversed
or
the
places
i
visited
that
day
would
take
more
space
than
i
would
like
to
devote
to
the
subject
dusk
came
and
i
had
failed
in
obtaining
the
least
clue
to
her
whereabouts
evening
followed
and
still
no
trace
of
the
fugitive
what
was
i
to
do
take
gryce
into
my
confidence
after
all
that
would
be
galling
to
my
pride
but
i
began
to
fear
i
should
have
to
submit
to
this
humiliation
when
i
happened
to
think
of
the
chinaman
to
think
of
him
once
was
to
think
of
him
twice
and
to
think
of
him
twice
was
to
be
conscious
of
an
irresistible
desire
to
visit
his
place
and
find
out
if
any
one
but
myself
had
been
there
to
inquire
after
the
lost
one
clothes
accompanied
by
lena
i
hurried
away
to
third
avenue
the
laundry
was
near
street
as
we
approached
i
grew
troubled
and
unaccountably
expectant
when
we
reached
it
i
understood
my
excitement
and
instantly
became
calm
for
there
stood
miss
oliver
gazing
like
one
under
a
spell
through
the
lighted
into
the
narrow
shop
where
the
owner
bent
over
his
ironing
she
had
evidently
stood
there
some
time
for
a
small
group
of
lads
were
watching
her
with
every
symptom
of
being
about
to
break
into
a
mischievous
display
of
curiosity
her
hands
which
were
without
gloves
were
pressed
against
the
glass
and
her
whole
attitude
showed
an
intensity
of
fatigue
which
would
have
laid
her
on
the
ground
had
she
not
been
sustained
by
an
equal
intensity
of
purpose
sending
lena
for
a
carriage
i
approached
the
poor
creature
and
drew
her
forcibly
from
the
window
do
you
want
anything
here
i
asked
i
will
go
in
with
you
if
you
do
she
surveyed
me
with
strange
apathy
and
yet
with
a
certain
sort
of
relief
too
then
she
slowly
shook
her
head
i
do
know
anything
about
it
my
head
swims
and
everything
looks
queer
but
some
one
or
something
sent
me
to
this
place
come
in
i
urged
come
in
for
a
minute
and
half
supporting
her
half
dragging
her
i
managed
to
get
her
across
the
threshold
and
into
the
chinaman
shop
immediately
a
dozen
faces
were
pressed
where
hers
had
been
the
chinaman
a
stolid
being
turned
as
he
heard
the
little
bell
tinkle
which
announced
a
customer
is
this
the
lady
who
left
the
clothes
here
a
few
nights
ago
i
asked
he
stopped
and
stared
recognizing
me
slowly
and
remembering
by
degrees
what
had
passed
between
us
at
our
last
interview
you
tellee
me
lalee
die
how
him
lalee
when
lalee
die
the
lady
is
not
dead
i
made
a
mistake
is
this
the
lady
lalee
talk
i
no
see
face
i
hear
speak
have
you
seen
this
man
before
i
inquired
of
my
nearly
insensible
companion
i
think
so
in
a
dream
she
murmured
trying
to
recall
her
poor
wandering
wits
back
from
some
region
into
which
they
had
strayed
him
lalee
cried
the
chinaman
overjoyed
at
the
prospect
of
getting
his
money
pletty
speak
i
knowee
him
lalee
want
clo
not
the
lady
is
sick
see
she
can
hardly
stand
and
overjoyed
at
this
seeming
evidence
that
the
police
had
failed
to
get
wind
of
my
interest
in
this
place
i
slipped
a
coin
into
the
hand
and
drew
miss
oliver
away
towards
the
carriage
i
now
saw
drawing
up
before
the
shop
lena
eyes
when
she
came
up
to
help
me
were
a
sight
to
see
they
seemed
to
ask
who
this
girl
was
and
what
i
was
going
to
do
with
her
i
answered
the
look
by
a
very
brief
and
evidently
wholly
unexpected
explanation
this
is
your
cousin
who
ran
away
i
remarked
do
you
recognize
her
lena
gave
me
up
then
and
there
but
she
accepted
my
explanation
and
even
lied
in
her
desire
to
carry
out
my
whim
yes
said
she
and
glad
i
am
to
see
her
again
and
with
a
deft
push
here
and
a
gentle
pull
there
she
succeeded
in
getting
the
sick
woman
into
the
carriage
the
crowd
which
had
considerably
increased
by
this
time
was
beginning
to
flock
about
us
with
shouts
of
no
little
derision
escaping
it
as
best
i
could
i
took
my
seat
by
the
poor
girl
side
and
bade
lena
give
the
order
for
home
when
we
left
the
behind
i
felt
that
the
last
page
in
my
adventures
as
an
amateur
detective
had
closed
but
i
counted
without
my
cost
miss
oliver
who
was
in
an
advanced
stage
of
fever
lay
like
a
dead
weight
on
my
shoulder
during
the
drive
down
the
avenue
but
when
we
entered
the
park
and
drew
near
my
house
she
began
to
show
such
signs
of
violent
agitation
that
it
was
with
difficulty
that
the
united
efforts
of
lena
and
myself
could
prevent
her
from
throwing
herself
out
of
the
carriage
door
which
she
had
somehow
managed
to
open
as
the
carriage
stopped
she
grew
worse
and
though
she
made
no
further
efforts
to
leave
it
i
found
her
present
impulses
even
harder
to
contend
with
than
the
former
for
now
she
would
not
be
pushed
out
or
dragged
out
but
crouched
back
moaning
and
struggling
her
eyes
fixed
on
the
stoop
which
is
not
unlike
that
of
the
adjoining
house
till
with
a
sudden
realization
that
the
cause
of
her
terror
lay
in
her
fear
of
the
scene
of
her
late
terrifying
experiences
i
bade
the
coachman
drive
on
and
reluctantly
i
own
carried
her
back
to
the
house
she
had
left
in
the
morning
and
this
is
how
i
came
to
spend
a
second
night
in
miss
hospitable
mansion
xxviii
taken
aback
one
incident
more
and
this
portion
of
my
story
is
at
an
end
my
poor
patient
sicker
than
she
had
been
the
night
before
left
me
but
little
leisure
for
thought
or
action
disconnected
with
my
care
for
her
but
towards
morning
she
grew
quieter
and
finding
in
an
open
drawer
those
tangled
threads
of
yarn
of
which
i
have
spoken
i
began
to
rewind
them
out
of
a
natural
desire
to
see
everything
neat
and
orderly
about
me
i
had
nearly
finished
my
task
when
i
heard
a
strange
noise
from
the
bed
it
was
a
sort
of
gurgling
cry
which
i
found
hard
to
interpret
but
which
only
stopped
when
i
laid
my
work
down
again
manifestly
this
sick
girl
had
very
nervous
fancies
when
i
went
down
to
breakfast
the
next
morning
i
was
in
that
complacent
state
of
mind
natural
to
a
woman
who
feels
that
her
abilities
have
asserted
themselves
and
that
she
would
soon
receive
a
recognition
of
the
same
at
the
hands
of
the
one
person
for
whose
commendation
she
had
chiefly
been
working
the
identification
of
miss
oliver
by
the
chinaman
was
the
last
link
in
the
chain
connecting
her
with
the
james
pope
who
had
accompanied
van
burnam
to
his
father
house
in
gramercy
park
and
though
i
would
fain
have
had
the
murdered
woman
rings
to
show
i
was
contented
enough
with
the
discoveries
i
had
made
to
wish
for
the
hour
which
would
bring
me
face
to
face
with
the
detective
but
a
surprise
awaited
me
at
the
breakfast
table
in
the
shape
of
a
communication
from
that
gentleman
it
had
just
been
brought
from
my
house
by
lena
and
it
ran
thus
dear
miss
butterworth
pardon
our
interference
have
found
the
rings
which
you
think
so
conclusive
an
evidence
of
guilt
against
the
person
secreting
them
and
your
this
was
basely
underlined
franklin
van
burnam
will
be
in
custody
i
will
wait
upon
you
at
ten
respectfully
yours
ebenezar
gryce
van
burnam
was
i
dreaming
van
burnam
accused
of
this
crime
and
in
custody
what
did
it
mean
i
had
found
no
evidence
against
franklin
van
burnam
the
girl
in
gray
xxix
amelia
becomes
peremptory
madam
i
hope
i
see
you
satisfied
this
was
gryce
greeting
as
he
entered
my
parlor
on
that
memorable
morning
satisfied
i
repeated
rising
and
facing
him
with
what
he
afterwards
described
as
a
stony
glare
pardon
me
i
suppose
you
would
have
been
still
more
satisfied
if
we
had
waited
for
to
point
out
the
guilty
man
to
but
you
must
make
some
allowances
for
professional
egotism
miss
butterworth
we
really
could
not
allow
you
to
take
the
initiatory
step
in
a
matter
of
such
importance
oh
was
my
sole
response
but
he
has
since
told
me
that
there
was
a
great
deal
in
that
so
much
that
even
he
was
startled
by
it
you
set
for
a
talk
with
me
he
went
on
probably
relying
upon
what
you
intended
to
assure
yourself
of
yesterday
but
our
discovery
at
the
same
time
as
yourself
of
the
rings
in
van
burnam
office
need
not
interfere
with
your
giving
us
your
full
confidence
the
work
you
have
done
has
been
excellent
and
we
are
disposed
to
give
you
considerable
credit
for
it
indeed
i
had
no
choice
but
to
thus
indulge
in
ejaculations
the
communication
he
had
just
made
was
so
startling
and
his
assumption
of
my
complete
understanding
of
and
participation
in
the
discovery
he
professed
to
have
made
so
puzzling
that
i
dared
not
venture
beyond
these
simple
exclamations
lest
he
should
see
the
state
of
mind
into
which
he
had
thrown
me
and
shut
up
like
an
oyster
we
have
kept
counsel
over
what
we
have
found
the
wary
old
detective
continued
with
a
smile
which
i
wish
i
could
imitate
but
which
unhappily
belongs
to
him
alone
i
hope
that
you
or
your
maid
i
should
say
have
been
equally
discreet
my
maid
i
see
you
are
touched
but
women
find
it
so
hard
to
keep
a
secret
but
it
does
not
matter
the
whole
town
will
know
that
the
older
and
not
the
younger
brother
has
had
these
rings
in
his
keeping
it
will
be
nuts
for
the
papers
i
commented
then
making
an
effort
i
remarked
you
are
a
most
judicious
man
gryce
and
must
have
other
reasons
than
the
discovery
of
these
rings
for
your
threatened
arrest
of
a
man
of
such
excellent
repute
as
silas
van
burnam
eldest
son
i
should
like
to
hear
them
gryce
i
should
like
to
hear
them
very
much
my
attempt
to
seem
at
ease
under
these
embarrassing
conditions
must
have
given
a
certain
sharpness
to
my
tone
for
instead
of
replying
he
remarked
with
well
simulated
concern
and
a
fatherly
humoring
of
my
folly
peculiarly
exasperating
to
one
of
my
temperament
you
are
displeased
miss
butterworth
because
we
did
not
let
find
the
rings
perhaps
but
we
were
engaged
in
an
open
field
i
could
not
expect
the
police
to
stand
aside
for
me
exactly
especially
when
you
have
the
secret
satisfaction
of
having
put
the
police
on
the
track
of
these
jewels
how
we
were
simply
fortunate
in
laying
our
hands
on
them
first
you
or
your
maid
rather
showed
us
where
to
look
for
them
lena
again
i
was
so
dumfounded
by
this
last
assertion
i
did
not
attempt
to
reply
fortunately
he
misinterpreted
my
silence
and
the
stony
glare
with
which
it
was
accompanied
i
know
that
it
must
seem
to
you
altogether
too
bad
to
be
tripped
up
at
the
moment
of
your
anticipated
triumph
but
if
apologies
will
suffice
to
express
our
sense
of
presumption
then
i
pray
you
to
accept
them
miss
butterworth
both
on
my
own
part
and
on
that
of
the
superintendent
of
police
i
did
not
understand
in
the
least
what
he
was
talking
about
but
i
recognized
the
sarcasm
of
his
final
expression
and
had
spirit
enough
to
reply
the
subject
is
too
important
for
any
more
nonsense
whereabouts
in
franklin
van
burnam
desk
were
these
rings
found
and
how
do
you
know
that
his
brother
did
not
put
them
there
your
ignorance
is
refreshing
miss
butterworth
if
you
will
ask
a
certain
young
girl
dressed
in
gray
upon
what
object
connected
with
van
burnam
desk
she
laid
her
hands
yesterday
morning
you
will
have
an
answer
to
your
first
question
the
second
one
is
still
more
easily
answered
howard
van
burnam
did
not
conceal
the
rings
in
the
duane
street
office
for
the
reason
that
he
has
not
been
in
that
office
since
his
wife
was
killed
regarding
this
fact
we
are
as
well
advised
as
yourself
now
you
change
color
miss
butterworth
but
there
is
no
necessity
for
an
amateur
you
have
made
less
trouble
and
fewer
mistakes
than
were
to
be
expected
worse
and
worse
he
was
patronizing
me
now
and
for
results
i
had
done
nothing
to
bring
about
i
surveyed
him
in
absolute
amazement
was
he
amusing
himself
with
me
or
was
he
himself
deceived
as
to
the
nature
and
trend
of
my
late
investigations
this
was
a
question
to
settle
and
at
once
and
as
duplicity
had
hitherto
proved
my
best
weapon
in
dealing
with
gryce
i
concluded
to
resort
to
it
in
this
emergency
clearing
my
brow
i
regarded
with
a
more
amenable
air
the
little
hungarian
vase
he
had
taken
up
on
entering
the
room
and
into
which
he
had
been
talking
ever
since
he
thought
it
worth
while
to
compliment
its
owner
i
do
not
wish
said
i
to
be
published
to
the
world
as
the
discoverer
of
franklin
van
burnam
guilt
but
i
do
want
credit
with
the
police
if
only
because
one
of
their
number
has
chosen
to
look
upon
my
efforts
with
disdain
i
mean
you
gryce
so
if
you
are
in
earnest
he
smiled
at
the
vase
most
genially
i
will
accept
your
apologies
just
so
far
as
you
honor
me
with
your
confidence
i
know
you
are
anxious
to
hear
what
evidence
i
have
collected
or
you
would
not
be
wasting
time
on
me
this
busy
morning
shrewd
was
the
short
ejaculation
he
shot
into
the
mouth
of
the
vase
he
was
handling
if
that
term
of
admiration
is
intended
for
me
i
remarked
i
am
sure
i
am
only
too
sensible
of
the
honor
but
flattery
has
never
succeeded
in
making
me
talk
against
my
better
judgment
i
may
be
shrewd
but
a
fool
could
see
what
you
are
after
this
morning
compliment
me
when
i
have
deserved
it
i
can
wait
i
begin
to
think
that
what
you
withhold
so
resolutely
has
more
than
common
value
miss
butterworth
if
this
is
so
i
must
not
be
the
only
one
to
listen
to
your
explanations
is
not
that
a
carriage
i
hear
stopping
i
am
expecting
inspector
z
if
that
is
he
you
have
been
wise
to
delay
your
communications
till
he
came
a
carriage
stopping
and
it
was
the
inspector
who
alighted
from
it
i
began
to
feel
my
importance
in
a
way
that
was
truly
gratifying
and
cast
my
eyes
up
at
the
portrait
of
my
father
with
a
secret
longing
that
its
original
stood
by
to
witness
the
verification
of
his
prophecy
but
i
was
not
so
distracted
by
these
thoughts
as
not
to
make
one
attempt
to
get
something
from
gryce
before
the
inspector
joined
us
why
do
you
speak
to
me
of
my
maid
in
one
breath
and
of
a
girl
in
gray
in
another
did
you
think
lena
hush
he
enjoined
we
will
have
ample
opportunities
to
discuss
this
subject
later
will
we
thought
i
we
will
discuss
nothing
till
i
know
more
positively
what
you
are
aiming
at
but
i
showed
nothing
of
this
determination
in
my
face
on
the
contrary
i
became
all
affability
as
the
inspector
entered
and
i
did
the
honors
of
the
house
in
a
way
i
hope
my
father
would
have
approved
of
had
he
been
alive
and
present
gryce
continued
to
stare
into
the
vase
miss
butterworth
it
was
the
inspector
who
was
speaking
i
have
been
told
that
you
take
great
interest
in
the
van
burnam
murder
and
that
you
have
even
gone
so
far
as
to
collect
some
facts
in
connection
with
it
which
you
have
not
as
yet
given
to
the
police
you
have
heard
correctly
i
returned
i
have
taken
a
deep
interest
in
this
tragedy
and
have
come
into
possession
of
some
facts
in
reference
to
it
which
as
yet
i
have
imparted
to
no
living
soul
gryce
interest
in
my
poor
little
vase
increased
marvellously
seeing
this
i
complacently
continued
i
could
not
have
accomplished
so
much
had
i
indulged
in
a
confidant
such
work
as
i
have
attempted
depends
for
its
success
upon
the
secrecy
with
which
it
is
carried
on
that
is
why
amateur
work
is
sometimes
more
effective
than
professional
no
one
suspected
me
of
making
inquiries
unless
it
was
this
gentleman
and
he
was
forewarned
of
my
possible
interference
i
told
him
that
in
case
howard
van
burnam
was
put
under
arrest
i
should
take
it
upon
myself
to
stir
up
matters
and
i
have
then
you
do
not
believe
in
van
burnam
guilt
not
even
in
his
complicity
i
suppose
ventured
the
inspector
i
do
not
know
anything
about
his
complicity
but
i
do
not
believe
the
stroke
given
to
his
wife
came
from
his
hand
i
see
i
see
you
believe
it
the
work
of
his
brother
i
stole
a
look
at
gryce
before
replying
he
had
turned
the
vase
upside
down
and
was
intently
studying
its
label
but
he
could
not
conceal
his
expectation
of
an
affirmative
answer
greatly
relieved
i
immediately
took
the
position
i
had
resolved
upon
and
calmly
but
vigorously
observed
what
i
believe
and
what
i
have
learned
in
support
of
my
belief
will
sound
as
well
in
your
ears
ten
minutes
hence
as
now
before
i
give
you
the
result
of
such
inquiries
as
i
have
been
enabled
to
make
i
require
to
know
what
evidence
you
have
yourself
collected
against
the
gentleman
you
have
just
named
and
in
what
respect
it
is
as
criminating
as
that
against
his
brother
is
not
that
peremptory
miss
butterworth
and
do
you
think
us
called
upon
to
part
with
all
or
any
of
the
secrets
of
our
office
we
have
informed
you
that
we
have
new
and
startling
evidence
against
the
older
brother
should
not
that
be
sufficient
for
you
perhaps
so
if
i
were
an
assistant
of
yours
or
even
in
your
employ
but
i
am
neither
i
stand
alone
and
although
i
am
a
woman
and
unused
to
this
business
i
have
earned
as
i
think
you
will
acknowledge
later
the
right
to
some
consideration
on
your
part
i
can
not
present
the
facts
i
have
to
relate
in
a
proper
manner
till
i
know
just
how
the
case
stands
it
is
not
curiosity
that
troubles
miss
butterworth
madam
i
said
it
was
not
curiosity
but
a
laudable
desire
to
have
the
whole
matter
arranged
with
precision
dropped
now
in
his
dryest
tones
from
the
detective
lips
gryce
has
a
most
excellent
understanding
of
my
character
i
gravely
observed
the
inspector
looked
nonplussed
he
glanced
at
gryce
and
he
glanced
at
me
but
the
smile
of
the
former
was
inscrutable
and
my
expression
if
i
showed
any
must
have
betrayed
but
little
relenting
if
called
as
a
witness
miss
butterworth
this
was
how
he
sought
to
manage
me
you
will
have
no
choice
in
the
matter
you
will
be
compelled
to
speak
or
show
contempt
of
court
that
is
true
i
acknowledged
but
it
is
not
what
i
might
feel
myself
called
upon
to
say
then
but
what
i
can
say
now
that
is
of
interest
to
you
at
this
present
moment
so
be
generous
gentlemen
and
satisfy
my
curiosity
for
such
gryce
considers
it
in
spite
of
his
assertions
to
the
contrary
will
it
not
all
come
out
in
the
papers
a
few
hours
hence
and
have
i
not
earned
as
much
at
your
hands
as
the
reporters
the
reporters
are
our
bane
do
not
liken
yourself
to
the
reporters
yet
they
sometimes
give
you
a
valuable
clue
gryce
looked
as
if
he
would
like
to
disclaim
this
but
he
was
a
judicious
soul
and
merely
gave
a
twist
to
the
vase
which
i
thought
would
cost
me
that
small
article
of
vertu
shall
we
humor
miss
butterworth
asked
the
inspector
we
will
do
better
answered
gryce
setting
the
vase
down
with
a
precision
that
made
me
jump
for
i
am
a
worshipper
of
and
prize
the
few
articles
i
own
possibly
beyond
their
real
value
we
will
treat
her
as
a
coadjutor
which
by
the
way
she
says
she
is
not
and
by
the
trust
we
place
in
her
secure
that
discretionary
use
of
our
confidence
which
she
shows
with
so
much
spirit
in
regard
to
her
own
begin
then
said
i
i
will
said
he
but
first
allow
me
to
acknowledge
that
you
are
the
person
who
first
put
us
on
the
track
of
franklin
van
burnam
xxx
the
matter
as
stated
by
gryce
i
had
exhausted
my
wonder
so
i
accepted
this
statement
with
no
more
display
of
surprise
than
a
grim
smile
when
you
failed
to
identify
howard
van
burnam
as
the
man
who
accompanied
his
wife
into
the
adjacent
house
i
realized
that
i
must
look
elsewhere
for
the
murderer
of
louise
van
burnam
you
see
i
had
more
confidence
in
the
excellence
of
your
memory
than
you
had
yourself
so
much
indeed
that
i
gave
you
more
than
one
chance
to
exercise
it
having
by
certain
little
methods
i
sometimes
employ
induced
different
moods
in
van
burnam
at
the
time
of
his
several
visits
so
that
his
bearing
might
vary
and
you
have
every
opportunity
to
recognize
him
for
the
man
you
had
seen
on
that
fatal
night
then
it
was
he
you
brought
here
each
time
i
broke
in
it
was
he
well
i
ejaculated
the
superintendent
and
some
others
whom
i
need
not
mention
here
gryce
took
up
another
small
object
from
the
table
believed
implicitly
in
his
guilt
conjugal
murder
is
so
common
and
the
causes
which
lead
to
it
so
frequently
puerile
therefore
i
had
to
work
alone
but
this
did
not
cause
me
any
concern
doubts
emphasized
mine
and
when
you
confided
to
me
that
you
had
seen
a
figure
similar
to
the
one
we
were
trying
to
identify
enter
the
adjoining
house
on
the
evening
of
the
funeral
i
made
immediate
inquiries
and
discovered
that
the
gentleman
who
had
entered
the
house
right
after
the
four
persons
described
by
you
was
van
this
gave
me
a
definite
clue
and
this
is
why
i
say
that
it
was
you
who
gave
me
my
first
start
in
this
matter
humph
thought
i
to
myself
as
with
a
sudden
shock
i
remembered
that
one
of
the
words
which
had
fallen
from
miss
oliver
lips
during
her
delirium
had
been
this
very
name
of
franklin
i
had
had
my
doubts
of
this
gentleman
before
continued
the
detective
warming
gradually
with
his
subject
a
man
of
my
experience
doubts
every
one
in
a
case
of
this
kind
and
i
had
formed
at
odd
times
a
sort
of
side
theory
so
to
speak
into
which
some
little
matters
which
came
up
during
the
inquest
seemed
to
fit
with
more
or
less
nicety
but
i
had
no
real
justification
for
suspicion
till
the
event
of
which
i
speak
that
you
had
evidently
formed
the
same
theory
as
myself
and
were
bound
to
enter
into
the
lists
with
me
put
me
on
my
mettle
madam
and
with
your
knowledge
or
without
it
the
struggle
between
us
began
so
your
disdain
of
me
i
here
put
in
with
a
triumphant
air
i
could
not
subdue
was
only
simulated
i
shall
know
what
to
think
of
you
hereafter
but
do
stop
go
on
this
is
all
deeply
interesting
to
me
i
can
understand
that
to
proceed
then
my
first
duty
of
course
was
to
watch
you
had
reasons
of
your
own
for
suspecting
this
man
so
by
watching
you
i
hoped
to
surprise
them
good
i
cried
unable
to
entirely
conceal
the
astonishment
and
grim
amusement
into
which
his
continued
misconception
of
the
trend
of
my
suspicions
threw
me
but
you
led
us
a
chase
madam
i
must
acknowledge
that
you
led
us
a
chase
your
being
an
amateur
led
me
to
anticipate
your
using
an
amateur
methods
but
you
showed
skill
madam
and
the
man
i
sent
to
keep
watch
over
boppert
against
your
visit
there
was
foiled
by
the
very
simple
strategy
you
used
in
meeting
her
at
a
neighboring
shop
good
i
again
cried
in
my
relief
that
the
discovery
made
at
that
meeting
had
not
been
shared
by
him
we
had
sounded
boppert
ourselves
but
she
had
seemed
a
very
hopeless
job
and
i
do
not
yet
see
how
you
got
any
water
out
of
that
stone
if
you
did
no
i
retorted
ambiguously
enjoying
the
inspector
manifest
delight
in
this
scene
as
much
as
i
did
my
own
secret
thoughts
and
the
prospect
of
the
surprise
i
was
holding
in
store
for
them
but
your
interference
with
the
clock
and
the
discovery
you
made
that
it
had
been
going
at
the
time
the
shelves
fell
was
not
unknown
to
us
and
we
have
made
use
of
it
good
use
as
you
will
hereafter
see
so
those
girls
could
not
keep
a
secret
after
all
i
muttered
and
waited
with
some
anxiety
to
hear
him
mention
the
but
he
did
not
greatly
to
my
relief
do
blame
the
girls
he
put
in
his
ears
evidently
are
as
sharp
as
mine
the
inquiries
having
proceeded
from
franklin
it
was
only
natural
for
me
to
suspect
that
he
was
trying
to
mislead
us
by
some
story
so
visited
the
girls
that
i
had
difficulty
in
getting
to
the
root
of
the
matter
is
to
their
credit
miss
butterworth
seeing
that
you
had
made
them
promise
secrecy
you
are
right
i
nodded
and
forgave
them
on
the
spot
if
i
could
not
withstand
gryce
eloquence
and
it
affected
me
at
times
how
could
i
expect
these
girls
to
besides
they
had
not
revealed
the
more
important
secret
i
had
confided
to
them
and
in
consideration
of
this
i
was
ready
to
pardon
them
most
anything
that
the
clock
was
going
at
the
time
the
shelves
fell
and
that
he
should
be
the
one
to
draw
our
attention
to
it
would
seem
to
the
superficial
mind
proof
positive
that
he
was
innocent
of
the
deed
with
which
it
was
so
closely
associated
the
detective
proceeded
but
to
one
skilled
in
the
subterfuges
of
criminals
this
seemingly
conclusive
fact
in
his
favor
was
capable
of
an
explanation
so
in
keeping
with
the
subtlety
shown
in
every
other
feature
of
this
remarkable
crime
that
i
began
to
regard
it
as
a
point
against
him
rather
than
in
his
favor
of
which
more
hereafter
not
allowing
myself
to
be
deterred
then
by
this
momentary
and
rejoicing
in
an
affair
considered
as
settled
by
my
superiors
i
proceeded
to
establish
franklin
van
burnam
connection
with
the
crime
which
had
been
laid
with
so
much
apparent
reason
at
his
brother
door
the
first
fact
to
be
settled
was
of
course
whether
your
identification
of
him
as
the
gentleman
who
accompanied
his
victim
into
van
burnam
house
could
be
corroborated
by
any
of
the
many
persons
who
had
seen
the
james
pope
at
the
hotel
d
as
none
of
the
witnesses
who
attended
the
inquest
had
presumed
to
recognize
in
either
of
these
sleek
and
haughty
gentlemen
the
shrinking
person
just
mentioned
i
knew
that
any
open
attempt
on
my
part
to
bring
about
an
identification
would
result
disastrously
so
i
employed
strategy
like
my
betters
miss
butterworth
here
his
bow
was
overpowering
in
its
mock
humility
and
rightly
considering
that
for
a
person
to
be
satisfactorily
identified
with
another
he
must
be
seen
under
the
same
circumstances
and
in
nearly
the
same
place
i
sought
out
franklin
van
burnam
and
with
specious
promises
of
some
great
benefit
to
be
done
his
brother
induced
him
to
accompany
me
to
the
hotel
d
whether
he
saw
through
my
plans
and
thought
that
a
brave
front
and
an
assumption
of
candor
would
best
serve
him
in
this
unexpected
dilemma
or
whether
he
felt
so
entrenched
behind
the
precautions
he
had
taken
as
not
to
fear
discovery
under
any
circumstances
he
made
but
one
demur
before
preparing
to
accompany
me
this
demur
was
significant
however
for
it
was
occasioned
by
my
advice
to
change
his
dress
for
one
less
conspicuously
fashionable
or
to
hide
it
under
an
ulster
or
mackintosh
and
as
a
proof
of
his
hardihood
remember
madam
that
his
connection
with
this
crime
has
been
established
he
actually
did
put
on
the
ulster
though
he
must
have
known
what
a
difference
it
would
make
in
his
appearance
the
result
was
all
i
could
desire
as
we
entered
the
hotel
i
saw
a
certain
hackman
start
and
lean
forward
to
look
after
him
it
was
the
one
who
had
driven
and
pope
away
from
the
hotel
and
when
we
passed
the
porter
the
wink
which
i
gave
him
was
met
by
a
lift
of
his
eyelids
which
he
afterwards
interpreted
into
very
like
but
it
was
from
the
clerk
i
received
the
most
unequivocal
proof
of
his
identity
on
entering
the
office
i
had
left
van
burnam
as
near
as
possible
to
the
spot
where
pope
had
stood
while
his
wife
was
inscribing
their
names
in
the
register
and
bidding
him
to
remain
in
the
background
while
i
had
a
few
words
at
the
desk
all
in
his
interests
of
course
i
succeeded
in
secretly
directing
attention
towards
him
the
start
which
he
gave
and
the
exclamation
he
uttered
were
unequivocal
there
the
man
now
he
cried
happily
in
a
whisper
look
drooping
head
brown
moustache
everything
but
the
duster
said
i
van
burnam
you
are
looking
at
what
are
you
thinking
of
help
it
said
he
saw
both
of
the
brothers
at
the
inquest
and
saw
nothing
in
them
then
to
remind
me
of
our
late
mysterious
guest
but
as
he
stands
there
he
a
sight
more
like
james
pope
than
the
other
one
is
and
do
you
forget
it
i
shrugged
my
shoulders
told
him
he
was
a
fool
and
that
fools
had
better
keep
their
follies
to
themselves
and
came
away
with
my
man
outwardly
disgusted
but
inwardly
in
most
excellent
trim
for
pursuing
an
investigation
which
had
opened
so
auspiciously
whether
this
man
possessed
any
motive
for
a
crime
so
seemingly
out
of
accordance
with
his
life
and
disposition
was
of
course
the
next
point
to
settle
his
conduct
at
the
inquest
certainly
showed
no
decided
animosity
toward
his
brother
wife
nor
was
there
on
the
surface
of
affairs
any
token
of
the
mortal
hatred
which
alone
could
account
for
a
crime
at
once
so
deliberate
and
so
brutal
but
we
detectives
plunge
below
the
surface
and
after
settling
the
question
of
identity
with
the
pope
of
the
hotel
d
i
left
new
york
and
its
interests
among
which
i
reckoned
your
efforts
at
detective
work
miss
butterworth
to
a
young
man
in
my
office
who
i
am
afraid
did
not
quite
understand
the
persistence
of
your
character
for
he
had
nothing
to
tell
me
concerning
you
on
my
return
save
that
you
had
been
cultivating
miss
althorpe
which
of
course
was
such
a
natural
thing
for
you
to
do
i
wonder
he
thought
it
necessary
to
mention
it
my
destination
was
four
corners
the
place
where
howard
first
met
his
future
wife
in
relating
what
i
learned
there
i
shall
doubtless
repeat
facts
with
which
you
are
acquainted
miss
butterworth
that
is
of
no
consequence
i
returned
with
almost
brazen
duplicity
for
i
not
only
was
ignorant
of
what
he
was
going
to
say
but
had
every
reason
to
believe
that
it
would
bear
as
remote
a
connection
as
possible
to
the
secret
then
laboring
in
my
breast
a
statement
of
the
case
from
your
lips
i
pursued
will
emphasize
what
i
know
do
not
stint
any
of
your
disclosures
then
i
beg
i
have
an
ear
for
all
this
was
truer
than
my
rather
sarcastic
tone
would
convey
for
might
not
his
story
after
all
prove
to
have
some
unexpected
relation
with
the
facts
i
had
myself
gathered
together
it
is
a
pleasure
said
he
to
think
i
am
capable
of
giving
any
information
to
miss
butterworth
and
as
i
did
not
run
across
you
or
your
very
nimble
and
pert
little
maid
during
my
stay
at
four
corners
i
shall
take
it
for
granted
that
you
confined
your
inquiries
to
the
city
and
the
society
of
which
you
are
such
a
shining
light
this
in
reference
to
my
double
visit
at
miss
althorpe
no
doubt
four
corners
is
a
charming
town
in
southern
vermont
and
here
three
years
ago
howard
van
burnam
first
met
miss
stapleton
she
was
living
in
a
gentleman
family
at
that
time
as
travelling
companion
to
his
invalid
daughter
ah
now
i
could
see
what
explanation
this
wary
old
detective
gave
himself
of
my
visits
to
miss
althorpe
and
began
to
hug
myself
in
anticipation
of
my
coming
triumph
over
him
the
place
did
not
fit
her
for
miss
stapleton
only
shone
in
the
society
of
men
but
harrison
had
not
yet
discovered
this
special
idiosyncrasy
of
hers
and
as
his
daughter
was
able
to
see
a
few
friends
and
in
fact
needed
some
diversion
the
way
was
open
to
her
companion
for
that
acquaintance
with
van
burnam
which
has
led
to
such
disastrous
results
the
house
at
which
their
meeting
took
place
was
a
private
one
and
i
soon
found
out
many
facts
not
widely
known
in
this
city
first
that
she
was
not
so
much
in
love
with
howard
as
he
was
with
her
succumbed
to
her
fascinations
at
once
and
proposed
i
believe
within
two
weeks
after
seeing
her
but
though
she
accepted
him
few
of
those
who
saw
them
together
thought
her
affections
very
much
engaged
till
franklin
suddenly
appeared
in
town
when
her
whole
manner
underwent
a
change
and
she
became
so
sparklingly
and
irresistibly
beautiful
that
her
avowed
lover
became
doubly
enslaved
and
franklin
well
there
is
evidence
to
prove
that
he
was
not
insensible
to
her
charms
either
that
in
spite
of
her
engagement
to
his
brother
and
the
attitude
which
honor
bade
him
hold
towards
his
prospective
he
lost
his
head
for
a
short
time
at
least
and
under
her
seductions
i
do
not
doubt
for
she
was
a
woman
according
to
general
repute
went
so
far
as
to
express
his
passion
in
a
letter
of
which
i
heard
much
before
i
was
so
fortunate
as
to
obtain
a
sight
of
it
this
was
three
years
ago
and
i
think
miss
stapleton
would
have
been
willing
to
have
broken
with
howard
and
married
franklin
if
the
latter
had
had
the
courage
to
meet
his
brother
reproaches
but
he
evidently
was
deficient
in
this
quality
his
very
letter
which
is
a
warm
one
but
which
holds
out
no
hope
to
her
of
any
closer
bond
between
them
than
that
offered
by
her
prospective
union
with
his
brother
shows
that
he
still
retained
some
sense
of
honor
and
as
he
presently
left
four
corners
and
did
not
appear
again
where
they
were
till
just
before
their
marriage
it
is
probable
that
all
would
have
gone
well
if
the
woman
had
shared
this
sentiment
with
him
but
she
was
made
up
of
mean
materials
and
while
willing
to
marry
howard
for
what
he
could
give
her
or
what
she
thought
he
could
give
her
she
yet
cherished
an
implacable
grudge
against
franklin
for
his
weakness
as
she
called
it
in
not
following
the
dictates
of
his
heart
being
sly
as
well
as
passionate
she
hid
her
feelings
from
every
one
but
a
venial
though
apparently
devoted
confidante
a
young
girl
named
oliver
i
finished
in
my
own
mind
but
the
name
he
mentioned
was
quite
different
pigot
he
said
looking
at
the
filigree
basket
he
held
in
his
hand
as
if
he
picked
this
word
out
from
one
of
its
many
interstices
she
was
french
and
after
once
finding
her
i
had
but
little
difficulty
in
learning
all
she
had
to
tell
she
had
been
miss
harrison
maid
but
she
was
not
above
serving
miss
stapleton
in
many
secret
and
dishonorable
ways
as
a
consequence
she
could
give
me
the
details
of
an
interview
which
that
lady
had
held
with
franklin
van
burnam
on
the
evening
of
her
wedding
it
took
place
in
harrison
garden
and
was
supposed
to
be
a
secret
one
but
the
woman
who
arranged
the
meeting
was
not
the
person
to
keep
away
from
it
when
it
occurred
and
consequently
i
have
been
enabled
to
learn
with
more
or
less
accuracy
what
took
place
between
them
it
was
not
to
miss
stapleton
credit
van
burnam
merely
wanted
his
letter
back
but
she
refused
to
return
it
unless
he
would
promise
her
a
complete
recognition
by
his
family
of
her
marriage
and
ensure
her
a
reception
in
his
father
house
as
howard
wife
this
was
more
than
he
could
engage
himself
to
perform
he
had
already
according
to
his
own
story
made
every
effort
possible
to
influence
the
old
gentleman
in
her
favor
but
had
only
succeeded
in
irritating
him
against
himself
it
was
an
acknowledgment
which
would
have
satisfied
most
women
but
it
did
not
satisfy
her
she
declared
her
intention
of
keeping
the
letter
for
fear
he
would
cease
his
exertions
and
heedless
of
the
effect
produced
upon
him
by
the
barefaced
threat
proceeded
to
inveigh
against
his
brother
for
the
very
love
which
made
her
union
with
him
possible
and
as
if
this
was
not
bad
enough
showed
at
the
same
time
such
a
disposition
to
profit
by
whatever
worldly
good
the
match
promised
that
franklin
lost
all
regard
for
her
and
began
to
hate
her
as
he
made
no
effort
to
conceal
his
feelings
she
must
have
become
immediately
aware
of
the
change
which
had
taken
place
in
them
but
however
affected
by
this
she
gave
no
sign
of
relenting
in
her
purpose
on
the
contrary
she
persisted
in
her
determination
to
retain
his
letter
and
when
he
remonstrated
with
her
and
threatened
to
leave
town
before
her
marriage
she
retorted
by
saying
that
if
he
did
so
she
would
show
his
letter
to
his
brother
as
soon
as
the
minister
had
made
them
one
this
threat
seemed
to
affect
franklin
deeply
and
while
it
intensified
his
feeling
of
animosity
towards
her
subjected
him
for
the
moment
to
her
whim
he
stayed
in
four
corners
till
the
ceremony
was
performed
but
was
such
a
gloomy
guest
that
all
united
in
saying
that
he
did
the
occasion
no
credit
so
much
for
my
work
in
four
corners
i
had
by
this
time
become
aware
that
gryce
was
addressing
himself
chiefly
to
the
inspector
being
gratified
no
doubt
at
this
opportunity
of
presenting
his
case
at
length
before
that
gentleman
but
true
to
his
special
habits
he
looked
at
neither
of
us
but
rather
at
the
fretted
basket
upon
the
handle
of
which
he
tapped
out
his
arguments
as
he
quickly
proceeded
the
young
couple
spent
the
first
months
of
their
married
life
in
yonkers
so
to
yonkers
i
went
next
there
i
learned
that
franklin
had
visited
the
place
twice
both
times
as
i
judge
upon
a
peremptory
summons
from
her
the
result
was
mutual
fret
and
heartburning
for
she
had
made
no
progress
in
her
endeavors
to
win
recognition
from
the
van
burnams
and
even
had
had
occasion
to
perceive
that
her
husband
love
based
as
it
was
upon
her
physical
attributes
had
begun
to
feel
the
stress
of
her
uneasiness
and
dissatisfaction
she
became
more
anxious
than
ever
for
social
recognition
and
distinction
and
when
the
family
went
to
europe
consented
to
accompany
her
husband
into
the
quiet
retreat
he
thought
best
calculated
to
win
the
approbation
of
his
father
only
upon
the
assurance
of
better
times
in
the
fall
and
a
possible
visit
to
washington
in
the
winter
but
the
quiet
to
which
she
was
subjected
had
a
bad
effect
upon
her
under
it
she
grew
more
and
more
restless
and
as
the
time
approached
for
the
family
return
conceived
so
many
plans
for
conciliating
them
that
her
husband
could
not
restrain
his
disgust
but
the
worst
plan
of
all
and
the
one
which
undoubtedly
led
to
her
death
he
never
knew
this
was
to
surprise
franklin
at
his
office
and
by
renewed
threats
of
showing
this
old
to
his
brother
win
an
absolute
promise
from
him
to
support
her
in
a
fresh
endeavor
to
win
his
father
favor
you
see
she
did
not
understand
silas
van
real
character
and
persisted
in
holding
the
most
extravagant
views
concerning
franklin
ascendancy
over
him
as
well
as
over
the
rest
of
the
family
she
even
went
so
far
as
to
insist
in
the
interview
which
jane
pigot
overheard
that
it
was
franklin
himself
who
stood
in
the
way
of
her
desires
and
that
if
he
chose
he
could
obtain
for
her
an
invitation
to
take
up
her
abode
with
the
rest
of
them
in
gramercy
park
to
duane
street
she
therefore
went
before
making
her
appearance
at
parker
a
fact
which
was
not
brought
out
at
the
inquest
franklin
not
disclosing
it
of
course
and
the
clerk
not
recognizing
her
under
the
false
name
she
chose
to
give
of
the
details
of
this
interview
i
am
ignorant
but
as
she
was
closeted
with
him
some
time
it
is
only
natural
to
suppose
that
conversation
of
some
importance
took
place
between
them
the
clerk
who
works
in
the
outer
office
did
not
as
i
have
said
know
who
she
was
at
the
time
but
he
noticed
her
face
when
she
came
out
and
he
declares
that
it
was
insolent
with
triumph
while
franklin
who
was
polite
enough
or
calculating
enough
to
bow
her
out
of
the
room
was
pale
with
rage
and
acted
so
unlike
himself
that
everybody
observed
it
she
held
his
letter
in
her
hand
a
letter
easily
distinguishable
by
the
seal
on
the
back
and
she
filliped
with
it
in
a
most
aggravating
way
as
she
crossed
the
floor
pretending
to
lay
it
down
on
howard
desk
as
she
went
by
and
then
taking
it
up
again
with
an
arch
look
at
franklin
pretty
enough
to
see
but
hateful
in
its
effect
on
him
as
he
went
back
to
his
own
room
his
face
was
full
of
anger
and
such
was
the
effect
of
this
visit
on
him
that
he
declined
to
see
any
one
else
that
day
she
had
probably
shown
such
determination
to
reveal
his
past
perfidy
to
her
husband
that
his
fears
were
fully
aroused
at
last
and
he
saw
he
was
not
only
likely
to
lose
his
good
name
but
the
esteem
with
which
he
was
accustomed
to
be
regarded
by
this
younger
and
evidently
brother
and
now
considering
his
intense
pride
as
well
as
his
affection
for
howard
do
you
not
see
the
motive
which
this
seemingly
good
man
had
for
putting
his
troublesome
out
of
existence
he
wanted
that
letter
back
and
to
obtain
it
had
to
resort
to
crime
or
such
is
my
present
theory
of
this
murder
miss
butterworth
does
it
correspond
with
yours
xxxi
some
fine
work
o
perfectly
i
assented
with
just
the
shade
of
irony
necessary
to
rob
the
assertion
of
its
mendacity
but
go
on
go
on
you
have
not
begun
to
satisfy
me
yet
you
did
not
stop
with
finding
a
motive
for
the
crime
i
am
sure
madam
you
are
a
female
shylock
you
will
have
the
whole
of
the
bond
or
none
we
are
not
here
to
draw
comparisons
i
retorted
keep
to
the
subject
gryce
keep
to
the
subject
he
laughed
laid
down
the
little
basket
he
held
took
it
up
again
and
finally
resumed
madam
you
are
right
we
did
not
stop
at
finding
a
motive
our
next
step
was
to
collect
evidence
directly
connecting
him
with
the
crime
and
you
succeeded
in
this
my
tone
was
unnecessarily
eager
this
was
all
so
unaccountable
to
me
but
he
did
not
appear
to
notice
it
we
did
indeed
the
evidence
against
him
is
stronger
than
that
against
his
brother
for
if
we
ignore
the
latter
part
of
howard
testimony
which
was
evidently
a
tissue
of
lies
what
remains
against
him
three
things
his
dogged
persistency
in
not
recognizing
his
wife
in
the
murdered
woman
the
receiving
of
the
house
keys
from
his
brother
and
the
fact
that
he
was
seen
on
the
stoop
of
his
father
house
at
an
unusual
hour
in
the
morning
following
this
murder
now
what
have
we
against
franklin
many
things
first
that
he
can
no
more
account
for
the
hours
between
eleven
on
tuesday
morning
and
five
on
the
following
wednesday
morning
than
his
brother
can
in
one
breath
he
declares
that
he
was
shut
up
in
his
rooms
at
the
hotel
for
which
no
corroborative
evidence
is
forthcoming
and
in
another
that
he
was
on
a
tramp
after
his
brother
which
seems
equally
improbable
and
incapable
of
proof
second
that
he
and
not
howard
was
the
man
in
a
linen
duster
and
that
he
and
not
howard
was
in
possession
of
the
keys
that
night
as
these
are
serious
statements
to
make
i
will
give
you
my
reasons
for
them
they
are
distinct
from
the
recognition
of
his
person
by
the
inmates
of
the
hotel
d
and
added
to
that
recognition
form
a
strong
case
against
him
the
janitor
who
has
charge
of
the
offices
in
duane
street
happening
to
have
a
leisure
moment
on
the
morning
of
the
day
on
which
van
burnam
was
murdered
was
making
the
most
of
it
by
watching
the
unloading
of
a
huge
boiler
some
four
doors
below
the
van
burnam
warehouse
he
was
consequently
looking
intently
in
that
direction
when
howard
passed
him
coming
from
the
interview
with
his
brother
in
which
he
had
been
given
the
keys
van
burnam
was
walking
briskly
but
finding
the
sidewalk
blocked
by
the
boiler
to
which
i
have
alluded
paused
for
a
moment
to
let
it
pass
and
being
greatly
heated
took
out
his
handkerchief
to
wipe
his
forehead
this
done
he
moved
on
just
as
a
man
dressed
in
a
long
duster
came
up
behind
him
stopping
where
he
stopped
and
picking
up
from
the
ground
something
which
the
first
gentleman
had
evidently
dropped
this
last
man
figure
looked
more
or
less
familiar
to
the
janitor
so
did
the
duster
and
later
he
discovered
that
the
latter
was
the
one
which
he
had
seen
hanging
for
so
long
a
time
in
the
little
disused
closet
under
the
warehouse
stairs
its
wearer
was
franklin
van
burnam
who
as
i
took
pains
to
learn
had
left
the
office
immediately
in
the
wake
of
his
brother
and
the
object
he
picked
up
was
the
bunch
of
keys
which
the
latter
had
inadvertently
dropped
he
may
have
thought
he
lost
them
later
but
it
was
then
and
there
they
slipped
from
his
pocket
i
will
here
add
that
the
duster
found
by
the
hackman
in
his
coach
has
been
identified
as
the
one
missing
from
the
closet
just
mentioned
third
the
keys
with
which
van
burnam
house
was
unlocked
were
found
hanging
in
their
usual
place
by
noon
of
the
next
day
they
could
not
have
been
taken
there
by
howard
for
he
was
not
seen
at
the
office
after
the
murder
by
whom
then
were
they
returned
if
not
by
franklin
fourth
the
letter
for
the
possession
of
which
i
believe
this
crime
to
have
been
perpetrated
was
found
by
us
in
a
supposedly
secret
drawer
of
this
gentleman
desk
it
was
much
crumpled
and
bore
evidences
of
having
been
rather
rudely
dealt
with
since
it
was
last
seen
in
van
burnam
hand
in
that
very
office
but
the
fact
which
is
most
convincing
and
which
will
tell
most
heavily
against
him
is
the
unexpected
discovery
of
the
murdered
lady
rings
also
in
this
same
desk
how
became
aware
that
anything
of
such
importance
could
be
found
there
knowing
even
the
exact
place
in
which
they
were
secreted
i
will
not
stop
to
ask
at
this
moment
enough
that
when
your
maid
entered
the
van
burnam
offices
and
insisted
with
so
much
ingenuousness
that
she
was
expected
by
van
burnam
and
would
wait
for
his
return
the
clerk
most
devoted
to
my
interests
became
distrustful
of
her
intentions
having
been
told
to
be
on
the
for
a
girl
in
gray
or
a
lady
in
black
with
puffs
on
each
side
of
two
very
sharp
eyes
you
will
pardon
me
miss
butterworth
he
therefore
kept
his
eyes
on
the
girl
and
presently
espied
her
stretching
out
her
hand
towards
a
hook
at
the
side
of
franklin
van
burnam
desk
as
it
is
upon
this
hook
this
gentleman
strings
his
unanswered
letters
the
clerk
rose
from
his
place
as
quickly
as
possible
and
coming
forward
with
every
appearance
of
polite
solicitude
did
she
not
say
he
was
polite
miss
butterworth
inquired
what
she
wished
thinking
she
was
after
some
letter
or
possibly
anxious
for
a
specimen
of
some
one
handwriting
but
she
gave
him
no
other
reply
than
a
blush
and
a
confused
look
for
which
you
must
rebuke
her
miss
butterworth
if
you
are
going
to
continue
to
employ
her
as
your
agent
in
these
very
delicate
affairs
and
she
made
another
mistake
she
should
not
have
left
so
abruptly
upon
detection
for
that
gave
the
clerk
an
opportunity
to
telephone
for
me
which
he
immediately
did
i
was
at
liberty
and
i
came
at
once
and
after
hearing
his
story
decided
that
what
was
of
interest
to
you
must
be
of
interest
to
me
and
so
took
a
look
at
the
letters
she
had
handled
and
discovered
what
she
also
must
have
discovered
before
she
let
them
slip
from
her
hand
that
the
five
missing
rings
we
were
all
in
search
of
were
hanging
on
this
same
hook
amid
the
sheets
of
correspondence
you
can
imagine
madam
my
satisfaction
and
the
gratitude
which
i
felt
towards
my
agent
who
by
his
quickness
had
retained
to
me
the
honors
of
a
discovery
which
it
would
have
been
injurious
to
my
pride
to
have
had
confined
entirely
to
yourself
i
can
understand
i
repeated
and
trusted
myself
to
say
no
more
hot
as
my
secret
felt
upon
my
lips
you
have
read
poe
story
of
the
filigree
basket
he
now
suggested
running
his
finger
up
and
down
the
filigree
work
he
himself
held
i
nodded
i
saw
what
he
meant
at
once
well
the
principle
involved
in
that
story
explains
the
presence
of
the
rings
in
the
midst
of
this
stack
of
letters
franklin
van
burnam
if
he
is
the
murderer
of
his
is
one
of
the
subtlest
villains
this
city
has
ever
produced
and
knowing
that
if
once
suspected
every
secret
drawer
and
professed
within
his
reach
would
be
searched
he
put
these
dangerous
evidences
of
his
guilt
in
a
place
so
conspicuous
and
yet
so
little
likely
to
attract
attention
that
even
so
old
a
hand
as
myself
did
not
think
of
looking
for
them
there
he
had
finished
and
the
look
he
gave
me
was
for
myself
alone
and
now
madam
said
he
that
i
have
stated
the
facts
of
the
case
against
franklin
van
burnam
has
not
the
moment
come
for
you
to
show
your
appreciation
of
my
good
nature
by
a
corresponding
show
of
confidence
on
your
part
i
answered
with
a
distinct
negative
there
is
too
much
that
is
unexplained
as
yet
in
your
case
against
franklin
i
objected
you
have
shown
that
he
had
motive
for
the
murder
and
that
he
was
connected
more
or
less
intimately
with
the
crime
we
are
considering
but
you
have
by
no
means
explained
all
the
phenomena
accompanying
this
tragedy
how
for
instance
do
you
account
for
van
burnam
whim
in
changing
her
clothing
if
her
instead
of
her
husband
was
her
companion
at
the
hotel
d
you
see
i
was
determined
to
know
the
whole
story
before
introducing
miss
oliver
name
into
this
complication
he
who
had
seen
through
the
devices
of
so
many
women
in
his
day
did
not
see
through
mine
perhaps
because
he
took
a
certain
professional
pleasure
in
making
his
views
on
this
subject
clear
to
the
attentive
inspector
at
all
events
this
is
the
way
he
responded
to
my
question
a
crime
planned
and
perpetrated
for
the
purpose
i
have
just
mentioned
miss
butterworth
could
not
have
been
a
simple
one
under
any
circumstances
but
conceived
as
this
one
was
by
a
man
of
more
than
ordinary
intelligence
and
carried
out
with
a
skill
and
precaution
little
short
of
marvellous
the
features
which
it
presents
are
of
such
a
varying
and
subtle
character
that
only
by
the
exercise
of
a
certain
amount
of
imagination
can
they
be
understood
at
all
such
an
imagination
i
possess
but
how
can
i
be
sure
that
you
do
by
testing
it
i
suggested
very
good
madam
i
will
not
from
actual
knowledge
then
but
from
a
certain
insight
i
have
acquired
in
my
long
dealing
with
such
matters
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
franklin
van
burnam
did
not
in
the
beginning
plan
to
kill
this
woman
in
his
father
house
on
the
contrary
he
had
fixed
upon
a
hotel
room
as
the
scene
of
the
conflict
he
foresaw
between
them
and
that
he
might
carry
it
on
without
endangering
their
good
names
had
urged
her
to
meet
him
the
next
morning
in
the
of
a
gossamer
over
her
fine
dress
and
a
heavy
veil
over
her
striking
features
making
the
pretence
no
doubt
of
this
being
the
more
appropriate
costume
for
her
to
appear
in
before
the
old
gentleman
should
he
so
far
concede
to
her
demands
as
to
take
her
to
the
steamer
for
himself
he
had
planned
the
adoption
of
a
disfiguring
duster
which
had
been
hanging
for
a
long
time
in
a
closet
on
the
of
the
building
in
duane
street
all
this
promised
well
but
when
the
time
came
and
he
was
about
to
leave
his
office
his
brother
unexpectedly
appeared
and
asked
for
the
key
to
their
father
house
disconcerted
no
doubt
by
the
appearance
of
the
very
person
he
least
wished
to
see
and
astonished
by
a
request
so
out
of
keeping
with
all
that
had
hitherto
passed
between
them
he
nevertheless
was
in
too
much
haste
to
question
him
so
gave
him
what
he
wanted
and
howard
went
away
as
soon
after
as
he
could
lock
his
desk
and
don
his
hat
franklin
followed
and
merely
stopping
to
cover
his
coat
with
the
old
duster
he
went
out
and
hastened
towards
the
place
of
meeting
under
most
circumstances
all
this
might
have
happened
without
the
brothers
encountering
each
other
again
but
a
temporary
obstruction
on
the
sidewalk
having
as
we
know
detained
howard
franklin
was
enabled
to
approach
him
sufficiently
close
to
see
him
draw
his
out
of
his
pocket
and
with
it
the
keys
which
he
had
just
given
him
the
latter
fell
and
as
there
was
a
great
pounding
of
iron
going
on
in
the
building
just
over
their
heads
howard
did
not
perceive
his
loss
but
went
quickly
on
franklin
coming
up
behind
him
picked
up
the
keys
and
with
a
thought
or
perhaps
as
yet
with
no
thought
of
the
use
to
which
they
might
be
applied
put
them
in
his
own
pocket
before
proceeding
on
his
way
new
york
is
a
large
place
and
much
can
take
place
in
it
without
comment
franklin
van
burnam
and
his
met
and
went
together
to
the
hotel
d
without
being
either
recognized
or
suspected
till
later
developments
drew
attention
to
them
that
should
consent
to
accompany
him
to
this
place
and
that
after
she
was
there
should
submit
as
she
did
to
taking
all
the
business
of
the
scheme
upon
herself
would
be
inconceivable
in
a
woman
of
a
character
but
louise
van
burnam
cared
for
little
save
her
own
aggrandisement
and
rather
enjoyed
so
far
as
we
can
see
this
very
doubtful
escapade
whose
real
meaning
and
murderous
purpose
she
was
so
far
from
understanding
as
the
steamer
contrary
to
all
expectation
had
not
yet
been
sighted
off
fire
island
they
took
a
room
and
prepared
to
wait
for
it
that
is
prepared
to
wait
he
had
no
intention
of
waiting
for
its
arrival
or
of
going
to
it
when
it
came
he
only
wanted
his
letter
but
louise
van
burnam
was
not
the
woman
to
relinquish
it
till
she
had
obtained
the
price
she
had
put
on
it
and
he
becoming
very
soon
aware
of
this
fact
began
to
ask
himself
if
he
should
not
be
obliged
to
resort
to
extreme
measures
in
order
to
regain
it
one
chance
only
remained
for
avoiding
these
he
would
seem
to
embrace
her
later
and
probably
scheme
of
presenting
herself
before
his
father
in
his
own
house
rather
than
at
the
steamer
and
by
urging
her
to
make
its
success
more
certain
by
a
different
style
of
dress
from
that
she
wore
induce
a
change
of
clothing
during
which
he
might
come
upon
the
letter
he
was
more
than
confident
she
carried
about
her
person
had
this
plan
worked
had
he
been
able
to
seize
upon
this
compromising
bit
of
paper
even
at
the
cost
of
a
scratch
or
two
from
her
vigorous
fingers
we
should
not
be
sitting
here
at
this
moment
trying
to
account
for
the
most
complicated
crime
on
record
but
louise
van
burnam
while
weak
and
volatile
enough
to
enjoy
the
romantic
features
of
this
transformation
scene
even
going
so
far
as
to
write
out
the
order
herself
with
the
same
effort
at
disguise
she
had
used
in
registering
their
assumed
names
at
the
desk
was
not
entirely
his
dupe
and
having
hidden
the
letter
in
her
shoe
what
i
cried
hidden
the
letter
in
her
repeated
gryce
with
his
finest
smile
she
had
but
to
signify
that
the
boots
sent
by
altman
were
a
size
too
small
for
her
to
retain
her
secret
and
keep
the
one
article
she
traded
upon
from
his
envious
clutch
you
seem
struck
dumb
by
this
miss
butterworth
have
i
enlightened
you
on
a
point
that
has
hitherto
troubled
you
do
ask
me
do
look
at
me
as
if
he
ever
looked
at
any
one
your
perspicacity
is
amazing
but
i
will
try
and
not
show
my
sense
of
it
if
it
is
going
to
make
you
stop
he
smiled
the
inspector
smiled
neither
understood
me
very
well
then
i
will
go
on
but
the
of
shoes
had
to
be
accounted
for
miss
butterworth
you
are
right
and
it
been
of
course
have
you
any
better
explanation
to
give
i
had
or
thought
i
had
and
the
words
trembled
on
my
tongue
but
i
restrained
myself
under
an
air
of
great
impatience
time
is
flying
i
urged
with
as
near
a
simulation
of
his
own
manner
in
saying
the
words
as
i
could
affect
go
on
mr
gryce
and
he
did
though
my
manner
evidently
puzzled
him
being
foiled
in
this
his
last
attempt
this
smooth
and
diabolical
villain
hesitated
no
longer
in
carrying
out
the
scheme
which
had
doubtless
been
maturing
in
his
mind
ever
since
he
dropped
the
key
of
his
father
house
into
his
own
pocket
his
brother
wife
must
die
but
not
in
a
hotel
room
with
him
for
a
companion
though
scorned
detested
and
a
in
the
way
of
the
whole
family
future
happiness
and
prosperity
she
still
was
a
van
burnam
and
no
shadow
must
fall
upon
her
reputation
further
than
this
for
he
loved
life
and
his
own
reputation
also
and
did
not
mean
to
endanger
either
by
this
act
of
she
must
perish
as
if
from
accident
or
by
some
blow
so
undiscoverable
that
it
would
be
laid
to
natural
causes
he
thought
he
knew
how
this
might
be
brought
about
he
had
seen
her
put
on
her
hat
with
a
very
thin
and
sharp
pin
and
he
had
heard
how
one
thrust
into
a
certain
spot
in
the
spine
would
effect
death
without
a
struggle
a
wound
like
that
would
be
small
almost
indiscernible
true
it
would
take
skill
to
inflict
it
and
it
would
require
dissimulation
to
bring
her
into
the
proper
position
for
the
contemplated
thrust
but
he
was
not
lacking
in
either
of
these
characteristics
and
so
he
set
himself
to
the
task
he
had
promised
himself
and
with
such
success
that
ere
long
the
two
left
the
hotel
and
proceeded
to
the
house
in
gramercy
park
with
all
the
caution
necessary
for
preserving
a
secret
which
meant
reputation
to
the
one
and
liberty
if
not
life
to
the
other
that
he
and
not
she
felt
the
greater
need
of
secrecy
witness
their
whole
conduct
and
when
their
goal
reached
she
and
not
he
put
the
money
into
the
driver
hand
the
last
act
of
this
curious
drama
of
opposing
motives
was
reached
and
only
the
final
catastrophe
was
wanting
with
what
arts
he
procured
her
and
by
what
show
of
simulated
passion
he
was
able
to
approach
near
enough
to
her
to
inflict
that
cool
and
calculating
thrust
which
resulted
in
her
immediate
death
i
leave
to
imagination
enough
that
he
compassed
his
ends
killing
her
and
regaining
the
letter
for
the
possession
of
which
he
had
been
willing
to
take
a
life
afterwards
well
afterwards
the
deed
he
had
thought
so
complete
began
to
assume
a
different
aspect
the
pin
had
broken
in
the
wound
and
knowing
the
scrutiny
which
the
body
would
receive
at
the
hands
of
a
coroner
jury
he
began
to
see
what
consequences
might
follow
its
discovery
so
to
hide
that
wound
and
give
to
her
death
the
appearance
of
accident
he
went
back
and
drew
down
the
cabinet
under
which
she
was
found
had
he
done
this
at
once
his
hand
in
the
tragedy
might
have
escaped
detection
but
he
waited
and
by
waiting
allowed
the
to
stiffen
and
all
that
phenomena
to
become
apparent
by
means
of
which
the
eyes
of
the
physicians
were
opened
to
the
fact
that
they
must
search
deeper
for
the
cause
of
death
than
the
bruises
she
had
received
thus
it
is
that
justice
opens
in
the
finest
web
a
criminal
can
weave
a
just
remark
gryce
but
in
this
web
of
weaving
you
have
not
explained
how
the
clock
came
to
be
running
and
to
stop
at
five
can
not
you
see
a
man
capable
of
such
a
crime
would
not
forget
to
provide
himself
with
an
alibi
he
expected
to
be
in
his
rooms
at
five
so
before
pulling
down
the
shelves
at
three
or
four
he
wound
the
clock
and
set
it
at
an
hour
when
he
could
bring
forward
testimony
to
his
being
in
another
place
is
not
such
a
theory
consistent
with
his
character
and
with
the
skill
he
has
displayed
from
the
beginning
to
the
end
of
this
woful
affair
aghast
at
the
deftness
with
which
this
able
detective
explained
every
detail
of
this
crime
by
means
of
a
theory
necessarily
hypothetical
if
the
discoveries
i
had
made
in
the
matter
were
true
and
for
the
moment
subjected
to
the
overwhelming
influence
of
his
enthusiasm
i
sat
in
a
maze
asking
myself
if
all
the
seemingly
irrefutable
evidence
upon
which
men
had
been
convicted
in
times
gone
by
was
as
false
as
this
to
relieve
myself
and
to
gain
renewed
confidence
in
my
own
views
and
the
discoveries
i
had
made
in
this
matter
i
repeated
the
name
of
howard
and
asked
how
in
case
the
whole
crime
was
conceived
and
perpetrated
by
his
brother
he
came
to
utter
such
equivocations
and
to
assume
that
position
of
guilt
which
had
led
to
his
own
arrest
do
you
think
i
inquired
that
he
was
aware
of
his
brother
part
in
this
affair
and
that
out
of
compassion
for
him
he
endeavored
to
take
the
crime
upon
his
own
shoulders
no
madam
men
of
the
world
do
not
carry
their
disinterestedness
so
far
he
not
only
did
not
know
the
part
his
brother
took
in
this
crime
but
did
not
even
suspect
it
or
why
acknowledge
that
he
lost
the
key
by
which
the
house
was
entered
i
do
not
understand
howard
actions
even
under
these
circumstances
they
seem
totally
inconsistent
to
me
madam
they
are
easily
explainable
to
one
who
knows
the
character
of
his
mind
he
prizes
his
honor
above
every
consideration
and
regarded
it
as
threatened
by
the
suggestion
that
his
wife
had
entered
his
empty
house
at
midnight
with
another
man
to
save
himself
that
shame
he
was
willing
not
only
to
perjure
himself
but
to
take
upon
himself
the
consequences
of
his
perjury
quixotic
certainly
but
some
men
are
constituted
that
way
and
he
for
all
his
amiable
characteristics
is
the
most
dogged
man
i
ever
encountered
that
he
ran
against
snags
in
his
attempted
explanations
seemed
to
make
no
difference
to
him
he
was
bound
that
no
one
should
accuse
him
of
marrying
a
false
woman
even
if
he
must
bear
the
opprobrium
of
her
death
it
is
hard
to
understand
such
a
nature
but
his
testimony
and
see
if
this
explanation
of
his
conduct
is
not
correct
and
still
i
mechanically
repeated
i
do
not
understand
gryce
may
not
have
been
a
patient
man
under
all
circumstances
but
he
was
patient
with
me
that
day
it
was
his
ignorance
miss
butterworth
his
total
ignorance
of
the
whole
affair
that
led
him
into
the
inconsistencies
he
manifested
let
me
present
his
case
as
i
already
have
his
brother
he
knew
that
his
wife
had
come
to
new
york
to
appeal
to
his
father
and
he
gathered
from
what
she
said
that
she
intended
to
do
this
either
in
his
house
or
on
the
dock
to
cut
short
any
opportunity
she
might
have
for
committing
the
first
folly
he
begged
the
key
of
the
house
from
his
brother
and
supposing
that
he
had
it
all
right
went
to
his
rooms
not
to
coney
island
as
he
said
and
began
to
pack
up
his
trunks
for
he
meant
to
flee
the
country
if
his
wife
disgraced
him
he
was
tired
of
her
caprices
and
meant
to
cut
them
short
as
far
as
he
was
himself
concerned
but
the
striking
of
the
midnight
hour
brought
better
counsel
he
began
to
wonder
what
she
had
been
doing
in
his
absence
going
out
he
haunted
the
region
of
gramercy
park
for
the
better
part
of
the
night
and
at
daybreak
actually
mounted
the
steps
of
his
father
house
and
prepared
to
enter
it
by
means
of
the
key
he
had
obtained
from
his
brother
but
the
key
was
not
in
his
pocket
so
he
came
down
again
and
walked
away
attracting
the
attention
of
stone
as
he
did
so
the
next
day
he
heard
of
the
tragedy
which
had
taken
place
within
those
very
walls
and
though
his
first
fears
led
him
to
believe
that
the
victim
was
his
wife
a
sight
of
her
clothes
naturally
dispelled
this
apprehension
for
he
knew
nothing
of
her
visit
to
the
hotel
d
or
of
the
change
in
her
habiliments
which
had
taken
place
there
his
father
persistent
fears
and
the
quiet
pressure
brought
to
bear
upon
him
by
the
police
only
irritated
him
and
not
until
confronted
by
the
hat
found
on
the
scene
of
death
an
article
only
too
well
known
as
his
wife
did
he
yield
to
the
accumulated
evidence
in
support
of
her
identity
immediately
he
felt
the
full
force
of
his
unkindness
towards
her
and
rushing
to
the
morgue
had
her
poor
body
taken
to
that
father
house
and
afterwards
given
a
decent
burial
but
he
could
not
accept
the
shame
which
this
acknowledgment
naturally
brought
with
it
and
blind
to
all
consequences
insisted
when
brought
up
again
for
examination
that
he
was
the
man
with
whom
she
came
to
that
lonely
house
the
difficulties
into
which
this
plunged
him
were
partly
foreseen
and
partly
prepared
for
and
he
showed
some
skill
in
surmounting
them
but
falsehoods
never
fit
like
truths
and
we
all
felt
the
strain
on
our
credulity
as
he
met
and
attempted
to
parry
the
coroner
questions
and
now
miss
butterworth
let
me
again
ask
if
your
turn
has
not
come
at
last
for
adding
the
sum
of
your
evidence
to
ours
against
franklin
van
burnam
it
had
i
could
not
deny
it
and
as
i
realized
that
with
it
had
also
come
the
opportunity
for
justifying
the
pretensions
i
had
made
i
raised
my
head
with
suitable
spirit
and
after
a
momentary
pause
for
the
purpose
of
making
my
words
the
more
impressive
i
asked
and
what
has
made
you
think
that
was
interested
in
fixing
the
guilt
on
franklin
van
burnam
xxxii
iconoclasm
the
surprise
which
this
very
simple
question
occasioned
showed
itself
differently
in
the
two
men
who
heard
it
the
inspector
who
had
never
seen
me
before
simply
stared
while
gryce
with
that
admirable
command
over
himself
which
has
helped
to
make
him
the
most
successful
man
on
the
force
retained
his
impassibility
though
i
noticed
a
small
corner
drop
from
my
filigree
basket
as
if
crushed
off
by
an
inadvertent
pressure
of
his
hand
i
judged
was
his
calm
reply
as
he
laid
down
the
injured
toy
with
an
apologetic
grunt
that
the
clearing
of
howard
from
suspicion
meant
the
establishment
of
another
man
guilt
and
so
far
as
we
can
see
there
has
been
no
other
party
in
the
case
besides
these
two
brothers
no
then
i
fear
a
great
surprise
awaits
you
gryce
this
crime
which
you
have
fixed
with
such
care
and
seeming
probability
upon
franklin
van
burnam
was
not
in
my
judgment
perpetrated
either
by
him
or
any
other
man
it
was
the
act
of
a
woman
a
woman
both
men
spoke
the
inspector
as
if
he
thought
me
demented
gryce
as
if
he
would
like
to
have
considered
me
a
fool
but
dared
not
yes
a
i
repeated
dropping
a
quiet
curtsey
it
was
a
proper
expression
of
respect
when
i
was
young
and
i
see
no
reason
why
it
should
not
be
a
proper
expression
of
respect
now
except
that
we
have
lost
our
manners
in
gaining
our
independence
something
which
is
to
be
regretted
perhaps
a
woman
whom
i
know
a
woman
whom
i
can
lay
my
hands
on
at
a
notice
a
young
woman
sirs
a
pretty
woman
the
owner
of
one
of
the
two
hats
found
in
the
van
burnam
parlors
had
i
exploded
a
the
inspector
could
not
have
looked
more
astounded
the
detective
who
was
a
man
of
greater
did
not
betray
his
feelings
so
plainly
though
he
was
not
entirely
without
them
for
as
i
made
this
statement
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
looked
at
me
both
of
those
hats
belonged
to
van
burnam
he
protested
the
one
she
wore
from
haddam
the
other
was
in
the
order
from
altman
she
never
ordered
anything
from
altman
was
my
uncompromising
reply
the
woman
whom
i
saw
enter
next
door
and
who
was
the
same
who
left
the
hotel
d
with
the
man
in
the
linen
duster
was
not
louise
van
burnam
she
was
that
lady
rival
and
let
me
say
it
for
i
dare
to
think
it
not
only
her
rival
but
the
prospective
taker
of
her
life
o
you
need
not
shake
your
heads
at
each
other
so
significantly
gentlemen
i
have
been
collecting
evidence
as
well
as
yourselves
and
what
i
have
learned
is
very
much
to
the
point
very
much
indeed
the
deuce
you
have
muttered
the
inspector
turning
away
from
me
but
gryce
continued
to
eye
me
like
a
man
fascinated
upon
what
said
he
do
you
base
these
extraordinary
assertions
i
should
like
to
hear
what
that
evidence
is
but
first
said
i
i
must
take
a
few
exceptions
to
certain
points
you
consider
yourself
to
have
made
against
franklin
van
burnam
you
believe
him
to
have
committed
this
crime
because
you
found
in
a
secret
drawer
of
his
desk
a
letter
known
to
have
been
in
van
burnam
hands
the
day
she
was
murdered
and
which
you
naturally
enough
i
acknowledge
conceive
he
could
only
have
regained
by
murdering
her
but
have
you
not
thought
of
another
way
in
which
he
could
have
obtained
it
a
perfectly
harmless
way
involving
no
one
either
in
deceit
or
crime
may
it
not
have
been
in
the
little
returned
by
parker
on
the
morning
of
the
discovery
and
may
not
its
crumpled
condition
be
accounted
for
by
the
haste
with
which
franklin
might
have
thrust
it
into
his
secret
drawer
at
the
untoward
entrance
of
some
one
into
his
office
i
acknowledge
that
i
have
not
thought
of
such
a
possibility
growled
the
detective
below
his
breath
but
i
saw
that
his
had
been
shaken
as
for
any
proof
of
complicity
being
given
by
the
presence
of
the
rings
on
the
hook
attached
to
his
desk
i
grieve
for
your
sake
to
be
obliged
to
dispel
that
illusion
also
those
rings
gryce
and
mr
inspector
were
not
discovered
there
by
the
girl
in
gray
but
taken
there
and
hung
there
at
the
very
moment
your
spy
saw
her
hand
fumbling
with
the
papers
taken
there
and
hung
there
by
your
maid
by
the
girl
lena
who
has
so
evidently
been
working
in
interests
what
sort
of
a
confession
are
you
making
miss
butterworth
ah
gryce
i
gently
remonstrated
for
i
actually
pitied
the
old
man
in
his
hour
of
humiliation
other
girls
wear
gray
besides
lena
it
was
the
woman
of
the
hotel
d
who
played
this
trick
in
van
burnam
office
lena
was
not
out
of
my
house
that
day
i
had
never
thought
gryce
feeble
though
i
knew
he
was
over
seventy
if
not
very
near
the
octogenarian
age
but
he
drew
up
a
chair
at
this
and
hastily
sat
down
tell
me
about
this
other
girl
said
he
but
before
i
repeat
what
i
said
to
him
i
must
explain
by
what
reasoning
i
had
arrived
at
the
conclusion
i
have
just
mentioned
that
ruth
oliver
was
the
visitor
in
van
burnam
office
there
was
but
little
reason
to
doubt
that
her
errand
was
one
in
connection
with
the
rings
was
equally
plain
what
else
would
have
driven
her
from
her
bed
when
she
was
hardly
able
to
stand
and
sent
her
in
a
state
of
fever
if
not
delirium
down
town
to
this
office
she
feared
having
these
rings
found
in
her
possession
and
she
also
cherished
a
desire
to
throw
whatever
suspicion
was
attached
to
them
upon
the
man
who
was
already
compromised
she
may
have
thought
it
was
howard
desk
she
approached
and
she
may
have
known
it
to
be
franklin
on
that
point
i
was
in
doubt
but
the
rest
was
clear
to
me
from
the
moment
gryce
mentioned
the
girl
in
gray
and
even
the
spot
where
she
had
kept
them
in
the
interim
since
the
murder
was
no
longer
an
unsolved
mystery
to
me
her
emotion
when
i
touched
her
and
the
shreds
of
unravelled
wool
i
had
found
lying
about
after
her
departure
had
set
my
wits
working
and
i
comprehended
now
they
had
been
wound
up
in
the
ball
of
yarn
i
had
so
carelessly
but
what
had
i
to
say
to
gryce
in
answer
to
his
question
much
and
seeing
that
further
delay
was
injudicious
i
began
my
story
then
and
there
prefacing
my
tale
with
the
suspicions
i
had
always
had
of
boppert
i
told
them
of
my
interview
with
that
woman
and
of
the
valuable
clue
she
had
given
me
by
confessing
that
she
had
let
van
burnam
into
the
house
prior
to
the
visit
of
the
couple
who
entered
there
at
midnight
knowing
what
an
effect
this
must
produce
upon
gryce
utterly
unprepared
for
it
as
he
was
i
looked
for
some
burst
of
anger
on
his
part
or
at
least
some
expression
of
but
he
only
broke
a
second
piece
off
my
little
filigree
basket
and
totally
unconscious
of
the
demolition
he
was
causing
cried
out
with
true
professional
delight
well
well
i
always
said
this
was
a
remarkable
case
a
very
remarkable
case
but
if
we
do
look
out
it
will
go
ahead
of
that
one
at
sibley
women
in
the
affair
and
one
of
them
in
the
house
before
the
arrival
of
the
victim
and
her
murderer
what
do
you
think
of
that
inspector
rather
late
for
us
to
find
out
so
important
a
detail
eh
rather
was
the
dry
reply
at
which
gryce
face
grew
long
and
he
exclaimed
half
shamefacedly
half
jocularly
outwitted
by
a
woman
well
it
a
new
experience
for
me
inspector
and
you
must
not
be
surprised
if
it
takes
me
a
minute
or
so
to
get
accustomed
to
it
a
too
it
cuts
inspector
it
cuts
but
as
i
went
on
and
he
learned
how
i
had
obtained
definite
proof
of
the
clock
having
been
not
only
wound
by
the
lady
thus
admitted
to
the
house
but
set
also
and
that
correctly
his
face
grew
even
longer
and
he
gazed
quite
dolefully
at
the
small
figure
in
the
carpet
to
which
he
had
transferred
his
attention
so
so
came
in
almost
indistinguishable
murmur
from
his
lips
all
my
pretty
theory
in
regard
to
its
being
set
by
the
criminal
for
the
purpose
of
confirming
his
attempt
at
a
false
alibi
was
but
a
figment
of
my
imagination
eh
sad
sad
but
it
was
neat
enough
to
have
been
true
was
it
not
inspector
quite
that
gentleman
admitted
yet
with
a
shade
of
irony
in
his
tone
that
made
me
suspect
that
for
all
his
confidence
in
and
evident
admiration
for
this
brilliant
old
detective
he
felt
a
certain
amount
of
pleasure
at
seeing
him
for
once
at
fault
perhaps
it
gave
him
more
confidence
in
his
own
judgment
seeing
that
their
ideas
on
this
case
had
been
opposed
from
the
start
well
well
i
getting
old
that
what
they
say
at
headquarters
but
go
on
miss
butterworth
let
us
hear
what
followed
for
i
am
sure
your
investigations
did
not
stop
there
i
complied
with
his
request
with
as
much
modesty
as
possible
but
it
was
hard
to
suppress
all
triumph
in
face
of
the
unrestrained
enthusiasm
with
which
he
received
my
communication
when
i
told
him
of
the
doubts
i
had
formed
in
regard
to
the
disposal
of
the
packages
brought
from
the
hotel
d
and
how
to
settle
those
doubts
i
had
taken
that
midnight
walk
down
street
he
looked
astonished
his
lips
worked
and
i
really
expected
to
see
him
try
to
pluck
that
flower
up
from
the
carpet
he
ogled
it
so
lovingly
but
when
i
mentioned
the
lighted
laundry
and
my
discoveries
there
his
admiration
burst
all
bounds
and
he
cried
out
seemingly
to
the
rose
in
the
carpet
really
to
the
inspector
did
i
tell
you
she
was
a
woman
in
a
thousand
see
now
we
ought
to
have
thought
of
that
laundry
ourselves
but
we
did
none
of
us
did
we
were
too
credulous
and
too
easily
satisfied
with
the
evidence
given
at
the
inquest
well
i
but
i
not
too
old
to
learn
proceed
miss
butterworth
i
admired
him
and
i
was
sorry
for
him
but
i
never
enjoyed
myself
so
much
in
my
whole
life
how
could
i
help
it
or
how
could
i
prevent
myself
from
throwing
a
glance
now
and
then
at
the
picture
of
my
father
smiling
upon
me
from
the
opposite
wall
it
was
my
task
now
to
mention
the
advertisement
i
had
inserted
in
the
newspapers
and
the
reflections
which
had
led
to
my
rather
daring
description
of
the
wandering
woman
as
one
dressed
thus
and
so
and
a
this
seemed
to
strike
him
as
i
had
expected
it
would
and
he
interrupted
me
with
a
quick
slap
of
his
leg
for
which
only
that
leg
was
prepared
good
he
ejaculated
a
fine
stroke
the
work
of
a
woman
of
genius
i
could
not
have
done
better
myself
miss
butterworth
and
what
came
of
it
something
i
hope
talent
like
yours
should
not
go
unrewarded
two
letters
came
of
it
said
i
one
from
cox
the
milliner
saying
that
a
bareheaded
girl
had
bought
a
hat
in
his
shop
early
on
the
morning
designated
and
another
from
a
desberger
appointing
a
meeting
at
which
i
obtained
a
definite
clue
to
this
girl
who
notwithstanding
she
wore
van
burnam
clothes
from
the
scene
of
tragedy
is
not
van
burnam
herself
but
a
person
by
the
name
of
oliver
now
to
be
found
at
miss
althorpe
house
in
street
as
this
was
in
a
measure
putting
the
matter
into
their
hands
i
saw
them
both
grow
impatient
in
their
anxiety
to
see
this
girl
for
themselves
but
i
kept
them
for
a
few
minutes
longer
while
i
related
my
discovery
of
the
money
in
her
shoes
and
hinted
at
the
explanation
it
afforded
for
her
not
changing
those
articles
under
the
influence
of
the
man
who
accompanied
her
this
was
the
last
blow
i
dealt
to
the
pride
of
gryce
he
quivered
under
it
but
soon
recovered
and
was
able
to
enjoy
what
he
called
another
fine
point
in
this
remarkable
case
but
the
acme
of
his
delight
was
reached
when
i
informed
him
of
my
ineffectual
search
for
the
rings
and
my
final
conclusion
that
they
had
been
wound
up
in
the
ball
of
yarn
attached
to
her
whether
his
pleasure
lay
chiefly
in
the
talent
shown
by
miss
oliver
in
her
choice
of
a
for
these
jewels
or
in
the
acumen
displayed
by
myself
in
discovering
it
i
do
not
know
but
he
evinced
an
unbounded
satisfaction
in
my
words
crying
aloud
beautiful
i
do
know
of
anything
more
interesting
we
have
not
seen
the
like
in
years
i
can
almost
congratulate
myself
upon
my
mistakes
the
features
of
the
case
they
have
brought
out
are
so
fine
but
his
satisfaction
great
as
it
was
soon
gave
way
to
his
anxiety
to
see
this
girl
who
if
not
the
criminal
herself
was
so
important
a
factor
in
this
great
crime
i
was
anxious
myself
to
have
him
see
her
though
i
feared
her
condition
was
not
such
as
to
promise
him
any
immediate
enlightenment
on
the
doubtful
portions
of
this
far
from
thoroughly
mastered
problem
and
i
bade
him
interview
the
chinaman
also
and
desberger
and
even
boppert
for
i
did
not
wish
him
to
take
for
granted
anything
i
had
said
though
i
saw
he
had
lost
his
attitude
of
disdain
and
was
inclined
to
accept
my
opinions
quite
seriously
he
answered
in
quite
an
manner
while
the
inspector
stood
by
but
when
that
gentleman
had
withdrawn
towards
the
door
gryce
remarked
with
more
earnestness
than
he
had
yet
used
you
have
saved
me
from
committing
a
folly
miss
butterworth
if
i
had
arrested
franklin
van
burnam
and
all
these
facts
had
come
to
light
i
should
never
have
held
up
my
head
again
as
it
is
there
will
be
numerous
insinuations
uttered
by
men
on
the
force
and
many
a
whisper
will
go
about
that
gryce
is
getting
old
that
gryce
has
seen
his
best
days
nonsense
was
my
vigorous
rejoinder
you
did
have
the
clue
that
is
all
nor
did
i
get
it
through
any
keenness
on
my
part
but
from
the
force
of
circumstances
boppert
thought
herself
indebted
to
me
and
so
gave
me
her
confidence
your
laurels
are
very
safe
yet
besides
there
is
enough
work
left
on
this
case
to
keep
more
than
one
great
detective
like
you
busy
while
the
van
burnams
have
not
been
proved
guilty
they
are
not
so
freed
from
suspicion
that
you
can
regard
your
task
as
completed
if
ruth
oliver
committed
this
crime
which
of
these
two
brothers
was
involved
in
it
with
her
the
facts
seem
to
point
towards
franklin
but
not
so
unerringly
that
no
doubt
is
possible
on
the
subject
true
true
the
mystery
has
deepened
rather
than
cleared
miss
butterworth
you
will
accompany
me
to
miss
althorpe
xxxiii
known
known
all
known
gryce
possesses
one
faculty
for
which
i
envy
him
and
that
is
his
skill
in
the
management
of
people
he
had
not
been
in
miss
house
five
minutes
before
he
had
won
her
confidence
and
had
everything
he
wished
at
his
command
had
to
talk
some
time
before
getting
so
far
but
a
word
and
a
look
did
it
miss
oliver
for
whom
i
hesitated
to
inquire
lest
i
should
again
find
her
gone
or
in
a
worse
condition
than
when
i
left
was
in
reality
better
and
as
we
went
i
allowed
myself
to
hope
that
the
questions
which
had
so
troubled
us
would
soon
be
answered
and
the
mystery
ended
but
gryce
evidently
knew
better
for
when
we
reached
her
door
he
turned
and
said
our
task
will
not
be
an
easy
one
go
in
first
and
attract
her
attention
so
that
i
can
enter
unobserved
i
wish
to
study
her
before
addressing
her
but
mind
no
words
about
the
murder
leave
that
to
me
i
nodded
feeling
that
i
was
falling
back
into
my
own
place
and
knocking
softly
entered
the
room
a
maid
was
sitting
with
her
seeing
me
she
rose
and
advanced
saying
miss
oliver
is
sleeping
then
i
will
relieve
you
i
returned
beckoning
gryce
to
come
in
the
girl
left
us
and
we
two
contemplated
the
sick
woman
silently
presently
i
saw
gryce
shake
his
head
but
he
did
not
tell
me
what
he
meant
by
it
following
the
direction
of
his
finger
i
sat
down
in
a
chair
at
the
head
of
the
bed
he
took
his
station
at
the
side
of
it
in
a
large
he
saw
there
as
he
did
so
i
saw
how
fatherly
and
kind
he
really
looked
and
wondered
if
he
was
in
the
habit
of
so
preparing
himself
to
meet
the
eye
of
all
the
suspected
criminals
he
encountered
the
thought
made
me
glance
again
her
way
she
lay
like
a
statue
and
her
face
naturally
round
but
now
thinned
out
and
hollow
looked
up
from
the
pillow
in
pitiful
quiet
the
long
lashes
accentuating
the
dark
places
under
her
eyes
a
sad
face
the
saddest
i
ever
saw
and
one
of
the
most
haunting
he
seemed
to
find
it
so
also
for
his
expression
of
benevolent
interest
deepened
with
every
passing
moment
till
suddenly
she
stirred
then
he
gave
me
a
warning
glance
and
stooping
took
her
by
the
wrist
and
pulled
out
his
watch
she
was
deceived
by
the
action
opening
her
eyes
she
surveyed
him
languidly
for
a
moment
then
heaving
a
great
sigh
turned
aside
her
head
do
tell
me
i
am
better
doctor
i
do
not
want
to
live
the
plaintive
tone
the
refined
accent
seemed
to
astonish
him
laying
down
her
hand
he
answered
gently
i
do
not
like
to
hear
that
from
such
young
lips
but
it
assures
me
that
i
was
correct
in
my
first
surmise
that
it
is
not
medicine
you
need
but
a
friend
and
i
can
be
that
friend
if
you
will
but
allow
me
moved
encouraged
for
the
instant
she
turned
her
head
from
side
to
side
probably
to
see
if
they
were
alone
and
not
observing
me
answered
softly
you
are
very
good
very
thoughtful
doctor
but
and
here
her
despair
returned
again
it
is
useless
you
can
do
nothing
for
me
you
think
so
remonstrated
the
old
detective
but
you
do
not
know
me
child
let
me
show
you
that
i
can
be
of
benefit
to
you
and
he
drew
from
his
pocket
a
little
package
which
he
opened
before
her
astonished
eyes
yesterday
in
your
delirium
you
left
these
rings
in
an
office
as
they
are
valuable
i
have
brought
them
back
to
you
i
right
my
child
no
no
she
started
up
and
her
accents
betrayed
terror
and
anguish
i
do
not
want
them
i
can
not
bear
to
see
them
they
do
not
belong
to
they
belong
to
to
whom
do
you
mean
by
them
queried
gryce
insinuatingly
the
the
van
burnams
is
not
that
the
name
oh
do
not
make
me
talk
i
am
so
weak
only
take
the
rings
back
i
will
child
i
will
gryce
voice
was
more
than
fatherly
now
it
was
tender
really
and
sincerely
tender
i
will
take
them
back
but
to
which
of
the
brothers
shall
i
return
them
to
he
hesitated
softly
to
franklin
or
to
howard
i
expected
to
hear
her
respond
his
manner
was
so
gentle
and
apparently
sincere
but
though
feverish
and
on
the
verge
of
wildness
she
had
still
some
command
over
herself
and
after
giving
him
a
look
the
intensity
of
which
called
out
a
corresponding
expression
on
his
face
she
faltered
out
i
i
do
care
i
do
know
either
of
the
gentlemen
but
to
the
one
you
call
howard
i
think
the
pause
which
followed
was
filled
by
the
of
fingers
on
his
knee
that
is
the
one
who
is
in
custody
he
observed
at
last
the
other
that
is
franklin
has
gone
thus
far
i
hear
no
answer
from
her
lips
he
waited
still
no
answer
if
you
do
not
know
either
of
these
gentlemen
he
insinuated
at
last
how
did
you
come
to
leave
the
rings
at
their
office
i
knew
their
names
i
inquired
my
way
it
is
all
a
dream
now
please
please
do
not
ask
me
questions
o
doctor
do
you
not
see
i
can
not
bear
it
he
smiled
i
never
could
smile
like
that
under
any
circumstances
and
softly
patted
her
hand
i
see
it
makes
you
suffer
he
acknowledged
but
i
must
make
you
suffer
in
order
to
do
you
any
good
if
you
would
tell
me
all
you
know
about
these
rings
she
passionately
turned
away
her
head
i
might
hope
to
restore
you
to
health
and
happiness
you
know
with
what
they
are
associated
she
made
a
slight
motion
and
that
they
are
an
invaluable
clue
to
the
murderer
of
van
burnam
another
motion
how
then
my
child
did
come
to
have
them
her
head
which
was
rolling
to
and
fro
on
the
pillow
stopped
and
she
gasped
rather
than
uttered
i
was
he
knew
this
yet
it
was
terrible
to
hear
it
from
her
lips
she
was
so
young
and
had
such
an
air
of
purity
and
innocence
but
more
heartrending
yet
was
the
groan
with
which
she
burst
forth
in
another
moment
as
if
impelled
by
conscience
to
unburden
herself
from
some
overwhelming
load
i
took
them
i
could
not
help
it
but
i
did
not
keep
them
you
know
that
i
did
not
keep
them
i
am
no
thief
doctor
whatever
i
am
i
am
no
thief
yes
yes
i
see
that
but
why
take
them
child
what
were
you
doing
in
that
house
and
whom
were
you
with
she
threw
up
her
arms
but
made
no
reply
will
you
not
tell
he
urged
a
short
silence
then
a
low
no
evidently
wrung
from
her
by
the
deepest
anguish
gryce
heaved
a
sigh
the
struggle
was
likely
to
be
a
more
serious
one
than
he
had
anticipated
miss
oliver
said
he
more
facts
are
known
in
relation
to
this
affair
than
you
imagine
though
unsuspected
at
first
it
has
secretly
been
proven
that
the
man
who
accompanied
the
woman
into
the
house
where
the
crime
took
place
was
van
burnam
a
low
gasp
from
the
bed
and
that
was
all
you
know
this
to
be
correct
do
you
miss
oliver
o
must
you
ask
she
was
writhing
now
and
i
thought
he
must
desist
out
of
pure
compassion
but
detectives
are
made
out
of
very
stern
stuff
and
though
he
looked
sorry
he
went
inexorably
on
justice
and
a
sincere
desire
to
help
you
force
me
my
child
were
you
not
the
woman
who
entered
van
burnam
house
at
midnight
with
this
man
i
entered
the
house
at
midnight
yes
and
with
this
man
silence
you
do
not
speak
miss
oliver
again
silence
it
was
franklin
who
was
with
you
at
the
hotel
d
she
uttered
a
cry
and
it
was
franklin
who
connived
at
your
change
of
clothing
there
and
advised
or
allowed
you
to
dress
yourself
in
a
new
suit
from
altman
oh
she
cried
again
then
why
should
it
not
have
been
he
who
accompanied
you
to
the
chinaman
and
afterwards
took
you
in
a
second
hack
to
the
house
in
gramercy
park
known
known
all
known
was
her
moan
sin
and
crime
can
not
long
remain
hidden
in
this
world
miss
oliver
the
police
are
acquainted
with
all
your
movements
from
the
moment
you
left
the
hotel
d
that
is
why
i
have
compassion
on
you
i
wish
to
save
you
from
the
consequences
of
a
crime
you
saw
committed
but
in
which
you
took
no
hand
o
she
exclaimed
in
one
involuntary
burst
as
she
half
rose
to
her
knees
if
you
could
save
me
from
appearing
in
the
matter
at
all
if
you
would
let
me
run
away
but
gryce
was
not
the
man
to
give
her
hope
on
any
such
score
impossible
miss
oliver
you
are
the
only
person
who
can
witness
for
the
guilty
if
should
let
you
go
the
police
would
not
then
why
not
tell
at
once
whose
hand
drew
the
from
your
hat
and
stop
she
shrieked
stop
you
kill
me
i
can
not
bear
it
if
you
bring
that
moment
back
to
my
mind
i
shall
go
mad
i
feel
the
horror
of
it
rising
in
me
now
be
still
i
pray
you
for
god
sake
to
be
still
this
was
mortal
anguish
there
was
no
acting
in
this
even
he
was
startled
by
the
emotion
he
had
raised
and
sat
for
a
moment
without
speaking
then
the
necessity
of
providing
against
all
further
mistakes
by
fixing
the
guilt
where
it
belonged
drove
him
on
again
and
he
said
like
many
another
woman
before
you
you
are
trying
to
shield
a
guilty
man
at
your
own
expense
but
it
is
useless
miss
oliver
the
truth
always
comes
to
light
be
advised
then
and
make
a
confidant
of
one
who
understands
you
better
than
you
think
but
she
would
not
listen
to
this
no
one
understands
me
i
do
not
understand
myself
i
only
know
that
i
shall
make
a
confidant
of
no
one
that
i
shall
never
speak
and
turning
from
him
she
buried
her
head
in
the
bedclothes
to
most
men
her
tone
and
the
action
which
accompanied
it
would
have
been
final
but
gryce
possessed
great
patience
waiting
for
just
a
moment
till
she
seemed
more
composed
he
murmured
gently
not
if
you
must
suffer
more
from
your
silence
than
from
speaking
not
if
men
i
do
not
mean
myself
child
for
i
am
your
friend
will
think
that
are
to
blame
for
the
death
of
the
woman
whom
you
saw
fall
under
a
cruel
stab
and
whose
rings
you
have
her
horror
was
unmistakable
so
were
her
surprise
her
terror
and
her
shame
but
she
added
nothing
to
the
word
she
had
uttered
and
he
was
forced
to
say
again
the
world
and
by
that
i
mean
both
good
people
and
bad
will
believe
all
this
will
let
them
believe
all
this
men
have
not
the
devotion
of
women
alas
alas
it
was
a
murmur
rather
than
a
cry
and
she
trembled
so
the
bed
shook
visibly
under
her
but
she
made
no
response
to
the
entreaty
in
his
look
and
gesture
and
he
was
compelled
to
draw
back
unsatisfied
when
a
few
heavy
minutes
had
passed
he
spoke
again
this
time
in
a
tone
of
sadness
few
men
are
worth
such
sacrifices
miss
oliver
and
a
criminal
never
but
a
woman
is
not
moved
by
that
thought
she
should
be
moved
by
this
however
if
either
of
these
brothers
is
to
blame
in
this
matter
consideration
for
the
guiltless
one
should
lead
you
to
mention
the
name
of
the
guilty
but
even
this
did
not
visibly
affect
her
i
shall
mention
no
names
said
she
a
sign
will
answer
i
shall
make
no
sign
then
howard
must
go
to
his
trial
a
gasp
but
no
words
and
franklin
proceed
on
his
way
undisturbed
she
tried
not
to
answer
but
the
words
would
come
pray
god
i
may
never
see
such
a
struggle
again
that
is
as
god
wills
i
can
do
nothing
in
the
matter
and
she
sank
back
crushed
and
wellnigh
insensible
gryce
made
no
further
effort
to
influence
her
xxxiv
exactly
three
she
is
more
unfortunate
than
wicked
was
gryce
comment
as
we
stepped
into
the
hall
nevertheless
watch
her
closely
for
she
is
in
just
the
mood
to
do
herself
a
mischief
in
an
hour
or
at
the
most
two
i
shall
have
a
woman
here
to
help
you
you
can
stay
till
then
all
night
if
you
say
so
that
you
must
settle
with
miss
althorpe
as
soon
as
miss
oliver
is
up
i
shall
have
a
little
scheme
to
propose
by
means
of
which
i
hope
to
arrive
at
the
truth
of
this
affair
i
must
know
which
of
these
two
men
she
is
shielding
then
you
think
she
did
not
kill
van
burnam
herself
i
think
the
whole
matter
one
of
the
most
puzzling
mysteries
that
has
ever
come
to
the
notice
of
the
new
york
police
we
are
sure
that
the
murdered
woman
was
van
burnam
that
this
girl
was
present
at
her
death
and
that
she
availed
herself
of
the
opportunity
afforded
by
that
death
to
make
the
exchange
of
clothing
which
has
given
such
a
complicated
twist
to
the
whole
affair
but
beyond
these
facts
we
know
little
more
than
that
it
was
franklin
van
burnam
who
took
her
to
the
gramercy
park
house
and
howard
who
was
seen
in
that
same
vicinity
some
two
or
four
hours
later
but
on
which
of
these
two
to
fix
the
responsibility
of
van
burnam
death
is
the
question
she
had
a
hand
in
it
herself
i
persisted
though
it
may
have
been
without
evil
intent
no
man
ever
carried
that
thing
through
without
feminine
help
to
this
opinion
i
shall
stick
much
as
this
girl
draws
upon
my
sympathies
i
shall
not
try
to
persuade
you
to
the
contrary
but
the
point
is
to
find
out
how
much
help
and
to
whom
it
was
given
and
your
scheme
for
doing
this
can
not
be
carried
out
till
she
is
on
her
feet
again
so
cure
her
miss
butterworth
cure
her
when
she
can
go
ebenezer
gryce
will
be
on
the
scene
to
test
his
little
scheme
i
promised
to
do
what
i
could
and
when
he
was
gone
i
set
diligently
to
work
to
soothe
the
child
as
he
had
called
her
and
get
her
in
trim
for
the
delicate
meal
which
had
been
sent
up
and
whether
it
was
owing
to
a
change
in
my
own
feelings
or
whether
the
talk
with
gryce
had
so
unnerved
her
that
any
womanly
ministration
was
welcome
she
responded
much
more
readily
to
my
efforts
than
ever
before
and
in
a
little
while
lay
in
so
calm
and
grateful
a
mood
that
i
was
actually
sorry
to
see
the
nurse
when
she
came
hoping
that
something
might
spring
from
an
interview
with
miss
althorpe
whereby
my
departure
from
the
house
might
be
delayed
i
descended
to
the
library
and
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
the
mistress
of
the
house
there
she
was
sorting
invitations
and
looked
anxious
and
worried
you
see
me
in
a
difficulty
miss
butterworth
i
had
relied
on
miss
oliver
to
oversee
this
work
as
well
as
to
assist
me
in
a
great
many
other
details
and
i
do
know
of
any
one
whom
i
can
get
on
short
notice
to
take
her
place
my
own
engagements
are
many
and
let
me
help
you
i
put
in
with
that
cheerfulness
her
presence
invariably
inspires
i
have
nothing
pressing
calling
me
home
and
for
once
in
my
life
i
should
like
to
take
an
active
part
in
wedding
festivities
it
would
make
me
feel
quite
young
again
but
she
began
oh
i
hastened
to
say
you
think
i
would
be
more
of
a
hindrance
to
you
than
a
help
that
i
would
do
the
work
perhaps
but
in
my
own
way
rather
than
in
yours
well
that
would
doubtless
have
been
true
of
me
a
month
since
but
i
have
learned
a
great
deal
in
the
last
few
weeks
you
will
not
ask
me
how
and
now
i
stand
ready
to
do
your
work
in
your
way
and
to
take
a
great
deal
of
pleasure
in
it
too
ah
miss
butterworth
she
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
genuine
feeling
which
i
would
not
have
lost
for
the
world
i
always
knew
that
you
had
a
kind
heart
and
i
am
going
to
accept
your
offer
in
the
same
spirit
in
which
it
is
made
so
that
was
settled
and
with
it
the
possibility
of
my
spending
another
night
in
this
house
at
ten
i
stole
away
from
the
library
and
the
delightful
company
of
stone
who
had
insisted
upon
sharing
my
labors
and
went
up
to
miss
oliver
room
i
met
the
nurse
at
the
door
you
want
to
see
her
said
she
she
asleep
but
does
not
rest
very
easily
i
do
think
i
ever
saw
so
pitiful
a
case
she
moans
continually
but
not
with
physical
pain
yet
she
seems
to
have
courage
too
for
now
and
then
she
starts
up
with
a
loud
cry
listen
i
did
so
and
this
is
what
i
heard
i
do
not
want
to
live
doctor
i
do
not
want
to
live
why
do
you
try
to
make
me
better
that
is
what
she
is
saying
all
the
time
sad
is
it
i
acknowledged
it
to
be
so
but
at
the
same
time
wondered
if
the
girl
were
not
right
in
wishing
for
death
as
a
relief
from
her
troubles
early
the
next
morning
i
inquired
at
her
door
again
miss
oliver
was
better
her
fever
had
left
her
and
she
wore
a
more
natural
look
than
at
any
time
since
i
had
seen
her
but
it
was
not
an
untroubled
one
and
it
was
with
difficulty
i
met
her
eyes
when
she
asked
if
they
were
coming
for
her
that
day
and
if
she
could
see
miss
althorpe
before
she
left
as
she
was
not
yet
able
to
leave
her
bed
i
could
easily
answer
her
first
question
but
i
knew
too
little
of
gryce
intentions
to
be
able
to
reply
to
the
second
but
i
was
easy
with
this
suffering
woman
very
easy
more
easy
than
i
ever
supposed
i
could
be
with
any
one
so
intimately
associated
with
crime
she
seemed
to
accept
my
explanations
as
readily
as
she
already
had
my
presence
and
i
was
struck
again
with
surprise
as
i
considered
that
my
name
had
never
aroused
in
her
the
least
emotion
miss
althorpe
has
been
so
good
to
me
i
should
like
to
thank
her
from
my
despairing
heart
i
should
like
to
thank
her
she
said
to
me
as
i
stood
by
her
side
before
leaving
do
you
know
she
went
on
catching
me
by
the
dress
as
i
was
turning
away
what
kind
of
a
man
she
is
going
to
marry
she
has
such
a
loving
heart
and
marriage
is
such
a
fearful
risk
fearful
i
repeated
is
it
not
fearful
to
give
one
whole
soul
to
a
man
and
be
met
by
i
must
not
talk
of
it
i
must
not
think
of
it
but
is
he
a
good
man
does
he
love
miss
althorpe
will
she
be
happy
i
have
no
right
to
ask
perhaps
but
my
gratitude
towards
her
is
such
that
i
wish
her
every
joy
and
pleasure
miss
althorpe
has
chosen
well
i
rejoined
stone
is
a
man
in
ten
thousand
the
sigh
that
answered
me
went
to
my
heart
i
will
pray
for
her
she
murmured
that
will
be
something
to
live
for
i
did
not
know
what
reply
to
make
to
this
everything
which
this
girl
said
and
did
was
so
unexpected
and
so
convincing
in
its
sincerity
i
felt
moved
by
her
even
against
my
better
judgment
i
pitied
her
and
yet
i
dared
not
urge
her
on
to
speak
lest
i
should
fail
in
my
task
of
making
her
well
i
therefore
confined
myself
to
a
few
haphazard
expressions
of
sympathy
and
encouragement
and
left
her
in
the
hands
of
the
nurse
next
day
gryce
called
your
patient
is
better
said
he
much
better
was
my
cheerful
reply
this
afternoon
she
will
be
able
to
leave
the
house
very
good
have
her
down
at
three
and
i
will
be
in
front
with
a
carriage
i
dread
it
i
cried
but
i
will
have
her
there
you
are
beginning
to
like
her
miss
butterworth
take
care
you
will
lose
your
head
if
your
sympathies
become
engaged
it
sits
pretty
firmly
on
my
shoulders
yet
i
retorted
and
as
for
sympathies
you
are
full
of
them
yourself
i
saw
how
you
looked
at
her
yesterday
bah
looks
you
can
not
deceive
me
gryce
you
are
as
sorry
for
the
girl
as
you
can
be
and
so
am
i
too
by
the
way
i
do
not
think
i
should
speak
of
her
as
a
girl
from
something
she
said
yesterday
i
am
convinced
she
is
a
married
woman
and
that
her
husband
well
madam
i
will
not
give
him
a
name
at
least
not
before
your
scheme
has
been
carried
out
are
you
ready
for
the
undertaking
i
will
be
this
afternoon
at
three
she
is
to
leave
the
house
not
a
minute
before
and
not
a
minute
later
remember
xxxv
a
ruse
it
was
a
new
thing
for
me
to
enter
into
any
scheme
blindfold
but
the
past
few
weeks
had
taught
me
many
lessons
and
among
them
to
trust
a
little
in
the
judgment
of
others
accordingly
i
was
on
hand
with
my
patient
at
the
hour
designated
and
as
i
supported
her
trembling
steps
down
the
stairs
i
endeavored
not
to
betray
the
intense
interest
agitating
me
or
to
awaken
by
my
curiosity
any
further
dread
in
her
mind
than
that
involved
by
her
departure
from
this
home
of
bounty
and
good
feeling
and
her
entrance
upon
an
unknown
and
possibly
much
to
be
apprehended
future
gryce
was
awaiting
us
in
the
lower
hall
and
as
he
caught
sight
of
her
slender
figure
and
anxious
face
his
whole
attitude
became
at
once
so
protecting
and
so
sympathetic
i
did
not
wonder
at
her
failure
to
associate
him
with
the
police
as
she
stepped
down
to
his
side
he
gave
her
a
genial
nod
i
am
glad
to
see
you
so
far
on
the
road
to
recovery
he
remarked
it
shows
me
that
my
prophecy
is
correct
and
that
in
a
few
days
you
will
be
quite
yourself
again
she
looked
at
him
wistfully
you
seem
to
know
so
much
about
me
doctor
perhaps
you
can
tell
me
where
they
are
going
to
take
me
he
lifted
a
tassel
from
a
curtain
near
by
looked
at
it
shook
his
head
at
it
and
inquired
quite
irrelevantly
have
you
bidden
to
miss
althorpe
her
eyes
stole
towards
the
parlors
and
she
whispered
as
if
half
in
awe
of
the
splendor
everywhere
surrounding
her
i
have
not
had
the
opportunity
but
i
should
be
sorry
to
go
without
a
word
of
thanks
for
her
goodness
is
she
at
home
the
tassel
slipped
from
his
hand
you
will
find
her
in
a
carriage
at
the
door
she
has
an
engagement
out
this
afternoon
but
wishes
to
say
to
you
before
leaving
oh
how
kind
she
is
burst
from
the
girl
white
lips
and
with
a
hurried
gesture
she
was
making
for
the
door
when
gryce
stepped
before
her
and
opened
it
two
carriages
were
drawn
up
in
front
neither
of
which
seemed
to
possess
the
elegance
of
so
rich
a
woman
equipage
but
gryce
appeared
satisfied
and
pointing
to
the
nearest
one
observed
quietly
you
are
expected
if
she
does
not
open
the
carriage
door
for
you
do
not
hesitate
to
do
it
yourself
she
has
something
of
importance
to
say
to
you
miss
oliver
looked
surprised
but
prepared
to
obey
him
steadying
herself
by
the
stone
balustrade
she
slowly
descended
the
steps
and
advanced
towards
the
carriage
i
watched
her
from
the
doorway
and
gryce
from
the
vestibule
it
seemed
an
ordinary
situation
but
something
in
the
latter
face
convinced
me
that
interests
of
no
small
moment
depended
upon
the
interview
about
to
take
place
but
before
i
could
decide
upon
their
nature
or
satisfy
myself
as
to
the
full
meaning
of
gryce
manner
she
had
started
back
from
the
carriage
door
and
was
saying
to
him
in
a
tone
of
modest
embarrassment
there
is
a
gentleman
in
the
carriage
you
must
have
made
some
mistake
gryce
who
had
evidently
expected
a
different
result
from
his
stratagem
hesitated
for
a
moment
during
which
i
felt
that
he
read
her
through
and
through
then
he
responded
lightly
i
made
a
mistake
eh
oh
possibly
look
in
the
other
carriage
my
child
with
an
unaffected
air
of
confidence
she
turned
to
do
so
and
i
turned
to
watch
her
for
i
began
to
understand
the
scheme
at
which
i
was
assisting
and
foresaw
that
the
emotion
she
had
failed
to
betray
at
the
door
of
the
first
carriage
might
not
necessarily
be
lacking
on
the
opening
of
the
second
i
was
all
the
more
assured
of
this
from
the
fact
that
miss
stately
figure
was
very
plainly
to
be
seen
at
that
moment
not
in
the
coach
miss
oliver
was
approaching
but
in
an
elegant
victoria
just
turning
the
corner
my
expectations
were
realized
for
no
sooner
had
the
poor
girl
swung
open
the
door
of
the
second
hack
than
her
whole
body
succumbed
to
a
shock
so
great
that
i
expected
to
see
her
fall
in
a
heap
on
the
pavement
but
she
steadied
herself
up
with
a
determined
effort
and
with
a
sudden
movement
full
of
subdued
fury
jumped
into
the
carriage
and
violently
shut
the
door
just
as
the
first
carriage
drove
off
to
give
place
to
miss
althorpe
humph
sprang
from
gryce
lips
in
a
tone
so
full
of
varied
emotions
that
it
was
with
difficulty
i
refrained
from
rushing
down
the
stoop
to
see
for
myself
who
was
the
occupant
of
the
coach
into
which
my
late
patient
had
so
passionately
precipitated
herself
but
the
sight
of
miss
althorpe
being
helped
to
the
ground
by
her
attendant
lover
recalled
me
so
suddenly
to
my
own
anomalous
position
on
her
stoop
that
i
let
my
first
impulse
pass
and
concerned
myself
instead
with
the
formation
of
those
apologies
i
thought
necessary
to
the
occasion
but
those
apologies
were
never
uttered
gryce
with
the
infinite
tact
he
displays
in
all
serious
emergencies
came
to
my
rescue
and
so
distracted
miss
althorpe
attention
that
she
failed
to
observe
that
she
had
interrupted
a
situation
of
no
small
moment
meanwhile
the
coach
containing
miss
oliver
had
at
a
signal
from
the
wary
detective
drawn
off
in
the
wake
of
the
first
one
and
i
had
the
doubtful
satisfaction
of
seeing
them
both
roll
down
the
street
without
my
having
penetrated
the
secret
of
either
a
glance
from
stone
who
had
followed
miss
althorpe
up
the
stoop
interrupted
gryce
flow
of
eloquence
and
a
few
minutes
later
i
found
myself
making
those
adieux
which
i
had
hoped
to
avoid
by
departing
in
miss
althorpe
absence
another
instant
and
i
was
hastening
down
the
street
in
the
direction
taken
by
the
two
carriages
one
of
which
had
paused
at
the
corner
a
few
rods
off
but
spry
as
i
am
for
one
of
my
settled
habits
and
sedate
character
i
found
myself
passed
by
gryce
and
when
i
would
have
accelerated
my
steps
he
darted
forward
quite
like
a
boy
and
without
a
word
of
explanation
or
any
acknowledgment
of
the
mutual
understanding
which
certainly
existed
between
us
leaped
into
the
carriage
i
was
endeavoring
to
reach
and
was
driven
away
but
not
before
i
caught
a
glimpse
of
miss
oliver
gray
dress
inside
determined
not
to
be
baffled
by
this
man
i
turned
about
and
followed
the
other
carriage
it
was
approaching
a
crowded
part
of
the
avenue
and
in
a
few
minutes
i
had
the
gratification
of
seeing
it
come
to
a
standstill
only
a
few
feet
from
the
the
opportunity
thus
afforded
me
of
satisfying
my
curiosity
was
not
to
be
slighted
without
pausing
to
consider
consequences
or
to
question
the
propriety
of
my
conduct
i
stepped
boldly
up
in
front
of
its
window
and
looked
in
there
was
but
one
person
inside
and
that
person
was
franklin
van
burnam
what
was
i
to
conclude
from
this
that
the
occupant
of
the
other
carriage
was
howard
and
that
gryce
now
knew
with
which
of
the
two
brothers
miss
oliver
memories
were
associated
the
end
of
a
great
mystery
xxxvi
the
result
i
was
as
much
surprised
at
this
result
of
gryce
scheme
as
he
was
and
possibly
i
was
more
chagrined
but
i
shall
not
enter
into
my
feelings
on
the
subject
or
weary
you
any
further
with
my
conjectures
you
will
be
much
more
interested
i
know
in
learning
what
occurred
to
gryce
upon
entering
the
carriage
holding
miss
oliver
he
had
expected
from
the
intense
emotion
she
displayed
at
the
sight
of
howard
van
burnam
for
i
was
not
mistaken
as
to
the
identity
of
the
person
occupying
the
carriage
with
her
to
find
her
flushed
with
the
passions
incident
upon
this
meeting
and
her
companion
in
a
condition
of
mind
which
would
make
it
no
longer
possible
for
him
to
deny
his
connection
with
this
woman
and
his
consequently
guilty
complicity
in
a
murder
to
which
both
were
linked
by
so
many
incriminating
circumstances
but
for
all
his
experience
the
detective
was
disappointed
in
this
expectation
as
he
had
been
in
so
many
others
connected
with
this
case
there
was
nothing
in
miss
oliver
attitude
to
indicate
that
she
had
unburdened
herself
of
any
of
the
emotions
with
which
she
was
so
grievously
agitated
nor
was
there
on
van
burnam
part
any
deeper
manifestation
of
feeling
than
a
slight
glow
on
his
cheek
and
even
that
disappeared
under
the
detective
scrutiny
leaving
him
as
composed
and
imperturbable
as
he
had
been
in
his
memorable
inquisition
before
the
coroner
disappointed
and
yet
in
a
measure
exhilarated
by
this
sudden
check
in
plans
he
had
thought
too
well
laid
for
failure
gryce
surveyed
the
young
girl
more
carefully
and
saw
that
he
had
not
been
mistaken
in
regard
to
the
force
or
extent
of
the
feelings
which
had
driven
her
into
van
burnam
presence
and
turning
back
to
that
gentleman
was
about
to
give
utterance
to
some
very
pertinent
remarks
when
he
was
forestalled
by
van
burnam
inquiring
in
his
old
calm
way
which
nothing
seemed
able
to
disturb
who
is
this
crazy
girl
you
have
forced
upon
me
if
i
had
known
i
was
to
be
subjected
to
such
companionship
i
should
not
have
regarded
my
outing
so
favorably
gryce
who
never
allowed
himself
to
be
surprised
by
anything
a
suspected
criminal
might
do
or
say
surveyed
him
quietly
for
a
moment
then
turned
towards
miss
oliver
you
hear
what
this
gentleman
calls
you
said
he
her
face
was
hidden
by
her
hands
but
she
dropped
them
as
the
detective
addressed
her
showing
a
countenance
so
distorted
by
passion
that
it
stopped
the
current
of
his
thoughts
and
made
him
question
whether
the
epithet
bestowed
upon
her
by
their
somewhat
callous
companion
was
entirely
unjustified
but
soon
the
something
else
which
was
in
her
face
restored
his
confidence
in
her
sanity
and
he
saw
that
while
her
reason
might
be
shaken
it
was
not
yet
dethroned
and
that
he
had
good
cause
to
expect
sooner
or
later
some
action
from
a
woman
whose
misery
could
wear
an
aspect
of
such
desperate
resolution
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
affected
by
the
force
and
desperate
character
of
her
glance
became
presently
apparent
for
van
burnam
with
a
more
kindly
tone
than
he
had
previously
used
observed
quietly
i
see
the
lady
is
suffering
i
beg
pardon
for
my
inconsiderate
words
i
have
no
wish
to
insult
the
unhappy
never
was
gryce
so
nonplussed
there
was
a
mingled
courtesy
and
composure
in
the
speaker
manner
which
was
as
far
removed
as
possible
from
that
strained
effort
at
which
marks
suppressed
passion
or
secret
fear
while
in
the
vacant
look
with
which
she
met
these
words
there
was
neither
anger
nor
scorn
nor
indeed
any
of
the
passions
one
would
expect
to
see
there
the
detective
consequently
did
not
force
the
situation
but
only
watched
her
more
and
more
attentively
till
her
eyes
fell
and
she
crouched
away
from
them
both
then
he
said
you
can
name
this
gentleman
can
you
not
miss
oliver
even
if
he
does
not
choose
to
recognize
but
her
answer
if
she
made
one
was
inaudible
and
the
sole
result
which
gryce
obtained
from
this
venture
was
a
quick
look
from
van
burnam
and
the
following
uncompromising
words
from
his
lips
if
you
think
this
young
girl
knows
me
or
that
i
know
her
you
are
greatly
mistaken
she
is
as
much
of
a
stranger
to
me
as
i
am
to
her
and
i
take
this
opportunity
of
saying
so
i
hope
my
liberty
and
good
name
are
not
to
be
made
dependent
upon
the
word
of
a
miserable
waif
like
this
your
liberty
and
your
good
name
will
depend
upon
your
innocence
retorted
gryce
and
said
no
more
feeling
himself
at
a
disadvantage
before
the
imperturbability
of
this
man
and
the
silent
attitude
of
this
woman
from
the
shock
of
whose
passions
he
had
anticipated
so
much
and
obtained
so
little
meantime
they
were
moving
rapidly
towards
police
headquarters
and
fearing
that
the
sight
of
that
place
might
alarm
miss
oliver
more
than
was
well
for
her
he
strove
again
to
rouse
her
by
a
kindly
word
or
so
but
it
was
useless
she
evidently
tried
to
pay
attention
and
follow
the
words
he
used
but
her
thoughts
were
too
busy
over
the
one
great
subject
that
engrossed
her
a
bad
case
murmured
van
burnam
and
with
the
phrase
seemed
to
dismiss
all
thought
of
her
a
bad
case
echoed
gryce
but
seeing
how
fast
the
look
of
resolution
was
replacing
her
previous
aspect
of
frenzy
one
that
will
do
mischief
yet
to
the
man
who
has
deceived
her
the
stopping
of
the
carriage
roused
her
looking
up
she
spoke
for
the
first
time
i
want
a
police
officer
she
said
gryce
with
all
his
assurance
restored
leaped
to
the
ground
and
held
out
his
hand
i
will
take
you
into
the
presence
of
one
said
he
and
she
without
a
glance
at
van
burnam
whose
knee
she
brushed
in
passing
leaped
to
the
ground
and
turned
her
face
towards
police
headquarters
xxxvii
two
weeks
but
before
she
was
well
in
her
countenance
changed
no
said
she
i
want
to
think
first
give
me
time
to
think
i
dare
not
say
a
word
without
thinking
truth
needs
no
consideration
if
you
wish
to
denounce
this
man
her
look
said
she
did
then
now
is
the
time
she
gave
him
a
sharp
glance
the
first
she
had
bestowed
upon
him
since
leaving
miss
althorpe
you
are
no
doctor
she
declared
are
you
a
i
am
a
detective
oh
and
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
shrinking
from
him
with
very
natural
distrust
and
aversion
i
have
been
in
the
toils
then
without
knowing
it
no
wonder
i
am
caught
but
i
am
no
criminal
sir
and
if
you
are
the
one
most
in
authority
here
i
beg
the
privilege
of
a
few
words
with
you
before
i
am
put
into
confinement
i
will
take
you
before
the
superintendent
said
gryce
but
do
you
wish
to
go
alone
shall
not
van
burnam
accompany
you
van
burnam
is
it
not
he
you
wish
to
denounce
i
do
not
wish
to
denounce
any
one
what
do
you
wish
asked
gryce
let
me
see
the
man
who
has
power
to
hold
me
here
or
let
me
go
and
i
will
tell
him
very
well
said
gryce
and
led
her
into
the
presence
of
the
superintendent
she
was
at
this
moment
quite
a
different
person
from
what
she
had
been
in
the
carriage
all
that
was
girlish
in
her
aspect
or
appealing
in
her
bearing
had
faded
away
evidently
forever
and
left
in
its
place
something
at
once
so
desperate
and
so
deadly
that
she
seemed
not
only
a
woman
but
one
of
a
very
determined
and
dangerous
nature
her
manner
however
was
quiet
and
it
was
only
in
her
eye
that
one
could
see
how
near
she
was
to
frenzy
she
spoke
before
the
superintendent
could
address
her
sir
said
she
i
have
been
brought
here
on
account
of
a
fearful
crime
i
was
unhappy
enough
to
witness
i
myself
am
innocent
of
that
crime
but
so
far
as
i
know
there
is
no
other
person
living
save
the
guilty
man
who
committed
it
who
can
tell
you
how
or
why
or
by
whom
it
was
done
one
man
has
been
arrested
for
it
and
another
has
not
if
you
will
give
me
two
weeks
of
complete
freedom
i
will
point
out
to
you
which
is
the
veritable
man
of
blood
and
may
heaven
have
mercy
on
his
soul
she
is
mad
signified
the
superintendent
in
to
gryce
but
the
latter
shook
his
head
she
was
not
mad
yet
i
know
she
continued
without
a
hint
of
the
timidity
which
seemed
natural
to
her
under
other
circumstances
that
this
must
seem
a
presumptuous
request
from
one
like
me
but
it
is
only
by
granting
it
that
you
will
ever
be
able
to
lay
your
hand
on
the
murderer
of
van
burnam
for
i
will
never
speak
if
i
can
not
speak
in
my
own
way
and
at
my
own
time
the
agonies
i
have
suffered
must
have
some
compensation
otherwise
i
should
die
of
horror
and
my
grief
and
how
do
you
hope
to
gain
compensation
by
this
delay
expostulated
the
superintendent
would
you
not
meet
with
more
satisfaction
in
denouncing
him
here
and
now
before
he
can
pass
another
night
in
fancied
security
but
she
only
repeated
i
have
said
two
weeks
and
two
weeks
i
must
have
two
weeks
in
which
to
come
and
go
as
i
please
two
weeks
and
no
argument
they
could
advance
succeeded
in
eliciting
from
her
any
other
response
or
in
altering
in
any
way
her
air
of
quiet
determination
with
its
underlying
suggestion
of
frenzy
acknowledging
their
mutual
defeat
by
a
look
the
superintendent
and
detective
drew
off
to
one
side
and
something
like
the
following
conversation
took
place
between
them
you
think
she
sane
i
do
and
will
remain
so
two
weeks
if
humored
you
are
sure
she
is
implicated
in
this
crime
she
was
a
witness
to
it
and
that
she
speaks
the
truth
when
she
declares
that
she
is
the
only
person
who
can
point
out
the
criminal
yes
that
is
she
is
the
only
one
who
will
do
it
the
attitude
taken
by
the
van
burnams
especially
by
howard
just
now
in
the
presence
of
this
girl
shows
how
little
we
have
to
expect
from
them
yet
you
think
they
know
as
much
as
she
does
about
it
i
do
not
know
what
to
think
for
once
i
am
baffled
superintendent
every
passion
which
this
woman
possesses
was
roused
by
her
unexpected
meeting
with
howard
van
burnam
and
yet
their
indifference
when
confronted
as
well
as
her
present
action
seems
to
argue
a
lack
of
connection
between
them
which
overthrows
at
once
the
theory
of
his
guilt
was
it
the
sight
of
franklin
then
which
really
affected
her
and
was
her
apparent
indifference
at
meeting
him
only
an
evidence
of
her
it
seems
an
impossible
conclusion
to
draw
and
indeed
there
are
nothing
but
hitches
and
improbable
features
in
this
case
nothing
fits
nothing
jibes
i
get
just
so
far
in
it
and
then
i
run
up
against
a
wall
either
there
is
a
superhuman
power
of
duplicity
in
the
persons
who
contrived
this
murder
or
we
are
on
the
wrong
tack
altogether
in
other
words
you
have
tried
every
means
known
to
you
to
get
at
the
truth
of
this
matter
and
failed
i
have
sir
sorry
as
i
may
be
to
acknowledge
it
then
we
must
accept
her
terms
she
can
be
shadowed
every
moment
very
well
then
extreme
cases
must
be
met
by
extreme
measures
we
will
let
her
have
her
swing
and
see
what
comes
of
it
revenge
is
a
great
weapon
in
the
hands
of
a
determined
woman
and
from
her
look
i
think
she
will
make
the
most
of
it
and
returning
to
where
the
young
girl
stood
the
superintendent
asked
her
whether
she
felt
sure
the
murderer
would
not
escape
in
the
time
that
must
elapse
before
his
apprehension
instantly
her
cheek
which
had
looked
as
if
it
could
never
show
color
again
flushed
a
deep
and
painful
scarlet
and
she
cried
vehemently
if
any
hint
of
what
is
here
passing
should
reach
him
i
should
be
powerless
to
prevent
his
flight
swear
then
that
my
very
existence
shall
be
kept
a
secret
between
you
two
or
i
will
do
nothing
towards
his
apprehension
no
not
even
to
save
the
innocent
we
will
not
swear
but
we
will
promise
returned
the
superintendent
and
now
when
may
we
expect
to
hear
from
you
again
two
weeks
from
as
the
clock
strikes
eight
be
wherever
i
may
chance
to
be
at
that
hour
and
see
on
whose
arm
i
lay
my
hand
it
will
be
that
of
the
man
who
killed
van
burnam
xxxviii
a
white
satin
gown
the
events
just
related
did
not
come
to
my
knowledge
for
some
days
after
they
occurred
but
i
have
recorded
them
at
this
time
that
i
might
in
some
way
prepare
you
for
an
interview
which
shortly
after
took
place
between
myself
and
gryce
i
had
not
seen
him
since
our
rather
unsatisfactory
parting
in
front
of
miss
althorpe
house
and
the
suspense
which
i
had
endured
in
the
interim
made
my
greeting
unnecessarily
warm
but
he
took
it
all
very
naturally
you
are
glad
to
see
me
said
he
been
wondering
what
has
become
of
miss
oliver
well
she
is
in
good
hands
with
desberger
in
short
a
woman
whom
i
believe
you
know
with
mrs
desberger
i
surprised
why
i
have
been
looking
every
day
in
the
papers
for
an
account
of
her
arrest
no
doubt
he
answered
but
we
police
are
slow
we
are
not
ready
to
arrest
her
yet
meanwhile
you
can
do
us
a
favor
she
wants
to
see
you
are
you
willing
to
visit
her
my
answer
contained
but
little
of
the
curiosity
and
eagerness
i
really
felt
i
am
always
at
your
command
do
you
wish
me
to
go
now
miss
oliver
is
impatient
he
admitted
her
fever
is
better
but
she
is
in
an
excited
condition
of
mind
which
makes
her
a
little
unreasonable
to
be
plain
she
is
not
quite
herself
and
while
we
still
hope
something
from
her
testimony
we
are
leaving
her
very
much
to
her
own
devices
and
do
not
cross
her
in
anything
you
will
therefore
listen
to
what
she
says
and
if
possible
aid
her
in
anything
she
may
undertake
unless
it
points
directly
towards
my
opinion
is
that
she
will
surprise
you
but
you
are
becoming
accustomed
to
surprises
are
you
not
thanks
to
you
i
am
very
well
then
i
have
but
one
more
suggestion
to
make
you
are
working
for
the
police
now
madam
and
nothing
that
you
see
or
learn
in
connection
with
this
girl
is
to
be
kept
back
from
us
am
i
understood
perfectly
but
it
is
only
proper
for
me
to
retort
that
i
am
not
entirely
pleased
with
the
part
you
assign
me
could
you
not
have
left
thus
much
to
my
good
sense
and
not
put
it
into
so
many
words
ah
madam
the
case
at
present
is
too
serious
for
risks
of
that
kind
van
burnam
reputation
to
say
nothing
of
his
life
depends
upon
our
knowledge
of
this
girl
secret
surely
you
can
stretch
a
point
in
a
matter
of
so
much
moment
i
have
already
stretched
several
and
i
can
stretch
one
more
but
i
hope
the
girl
wo
look
at
me
too
often
with
those
miserable
appealing
eyes
of
hers
they
make
me
feel
like
a
traitor
you
will
not
be
troubled
by
any
appeal
in
them
the
appeal
has
vanished
something
harder
and
even
more
difficult
to
meet
is
to
be
found
in
them
now
wrath
purpose
and
a
desire
for
vengeance
she
is
not
the
same
woman
i
assure
you
well
i
sighed
i
am
sorry
there
is
something
about
the
girl
that
lays
hold
of
me
and
i
hate
to
see
such
a
change
in
her
did
she
ask
for
me
by
name
i
believe
so
i
can
not
understand
her
wanting
me
but
i
will
go
and
i
wo
leave
her
either
till
she
shows
me
she
is
tired
of
me
i
am
as
anxious
to
see
the
end
of
this
matter
as
you
are
then
with
some
vague
idea
that
i
had
earned
a
right
to
some
show
of
confidence
on
his
part
i
added
insinuatingly
i
supposed
you
would
feel
the
case
settled
when
she
almost
fainted
at
the
sight
of
the
younger
van
burnam
the
old
ambiguous
smile
i
remembered
so
well
came
to
modify
his
brusque
rejoinder
if
she
had
been
a
woman
like
you
i
should
but
she
is
a
deep
one
miss
butterworth
too
deep
for
the
success
of
a
little
ruse
like
mine
are
you
ready
i
was
not
but
it
did
not
take
me
long
to
be
so
and
before
an
hour
had
elapsed
i
was
seated
in
desberger
parlor
in
ninth
street
miss
oliver
was
in
and
ere
long
made
her
appearance
she
was
dressed
in
street
costume
i
was
prepared
for
a
change
in
her
and
yet
the
shock
i
felt
when
i
first
saw
her
face
must
have
been
apparent
for
she
immediately
remarked
you
find
me
quite
well
miss
butterworth
for
this
i
am
partially
indebted
to
you
you
were
very
good
to
nurse
me
so
carefully
will
you
be
still
kinder
and
help
me
in
a
new
matter
which
i
feel
quite
incompetent
to
undertake
alone
her
face
was
flushed
her
manner
nervous
but
her
eyes
had
an
extraordinary
look
in
them
which
affected
me
most
painfully
notwithstanding
the
additional
effect
it
gave
to
her
beauty
certainly
said
i
what
can
i
do
for
you
i
wish
to
buy
me
a
dress
was
her
unexpected
reply
a
handsome
dress
do
you
object
to
showing
me
the
best
shops
i
am
a
stranger
in
new
york
more
astonished
than
i
can
express
but
carefully
concealing
it
in
remembrance
of
the
caution
received
from
gryce
i
replied
that
i
would
be
only
too
happy
to
accompany
her
on
such
an
errand
upon
which
she
lost
her
nervousness
and
prepared
at
once
to
go
out
with
me
i
would
have
asked
desberger
she
observed
while
fitting
on
her
gloves
but
her
taste
here
she
cast
a
significant
look
about
the
room
is
not
quiet
enough
for
me
i
should
think
not
i
cried
i
shall
be
a
trouble
to
you
the
girl
went
on
with
a
gleam
in
her
eye
that
spoke
of
the
restless
spirit
within
i
have
many
things
to
buy
and
they
must
all
be
rich
and
handsome
if
you
have
money
enough
there
will
be
no
trouble
about
that
oh
i
have
money
she
spoke
like
a
millionaire
daughter
shall
we
go
to
arnold
as
i
always
traded
at
arnold
i
readily
acquiesced
and
we
left
the
house
but
not
before
she
had
tied
a
very
thick
veil
over
her
face
if
we
meet
any
one
do
not
introduce
me
she
begged
i
can
not
talk
to
people
you
may
rest
easy
i
assured
her
at
the
corner
she
stopped
is
there
any
way
of
getting
a
carriage
she
asked
do
you
want
one
yes
i
signalled
a
hack
now
for
the
dress
she
cried
we
rode
at
once
to
arnold
what
kind
of
a
dress
do
you
want
i
inquired
as
we
entered
the
store
an
evening
one
a
white
satin
i
think
i
could
not
help
the
exclamation
which
escaped
me
but
i
covered
it
up
as
quickly
as
possible
by
a
hurried
remark
in
favor
of
white
and
we
proceeded
at
once
to
the
silk
counter
i
will
trust
it
all
to
you
she
whispered
in
an
odd
choked
tone
as
the
clerk
approached
us
get
what
you
would
for
your
daughter
no
no
for
van
burnam
daughter
if
he
has
one
and
do
not
spare
expense
i
have
five
hundred
dollars
in
my
pocket
van
burnam
daughter
well
well
a
tragedy
of
some
kind
was
portending
but
i
bought
the
dress
now
said
she
lace
and
whatever
else
i
need
to
make
it
up
suitably
and
i
must
have
slippers
and
gloves
you
know
what
a
young
girl
requires
to
make
her
look
like
a
lady
i
want
to
look
so
well
that
the
most
critical
eye
will
detect
no
fault
in
my
appearance
it
can
be
done
can
it
not
miss
butterworth
my
face
and
figure
will
not
spoil
the
effect
will
they
no
said
i
you
have
a
good
face
and
a
beautiful
figure
you
ought
to
look
well
are
you
going
to
a
ball
my
dear
i
am
going
to
a
ball
she
answered
but
her
tone
was
so
strange
the
people
passing
us
turned
to
look
at
her
let
us
have
everything
sent
to
the
carriage
said
she
and
went
with
me
from
counter
to
counter
with
her
ready
purse
in
her
hand
but
not
once
lifting
her
veil
to
look
at
what
was
offered
us
saying
over
and
over
as
i
sought
to
consult
her
in
regard
to
some
article
buy
the
richest
i
leave
it
all
to
you
had
gryce
not
told
me
she
must
be
humored
i
could
never
have
gone
through
this
ordeal
to
see
a
girl
thus
expend
her
hoarded
savings
on
such
frivolities
was
absolutely
painful
to
me
and
more
than
once
i
was
tempted
to
decline
any
further
participation
in
such
extravagance
but
a
thought
of
my
obligations
to
gryce
restrained
me
and
i
went
on
spending
the
poor
girl
dollars
with
more
pain
to
myself
than
if
i
had
taken
them
out
of
my
own
pocket
having
purchased
all
the
articles
we
thought
necessary
we
were
turning
towards
the
door
when
miss
oliver
whispered
wait
for
me
in
the
carriage
for
just
a
few
minutes
i
have
one
more
thing
to
buy
and
i
must
do
it
alone
but
i
began
i
will
do
it
and
i
will
not
be
followed
she
insisted
in
a
shrill
tone
that
made
me
jump
and
seeing
no
other
way
of
preventing
a
scene
i
let
her
leave
me
though
it
cost
me
an
anxious
fifteen
minutes
when
she
rejoined
me
as
she
did
at
the
expiration
of
that
time
i
eyed
the
bundle
she
held
with
decided
curiosity
but
i
could
make
no
guess
at
its
contents
now
she
cried
as
she
reseated
herself
and
closed
the
carriage
door
where
shall
i
find
a
dressmaker
able
and
willing
to
make
up
this
satin
in
five
days
i
could
not
tell
her
but
after
some
little
search
we
succeeded
in
finding
a
woman
who
engaged
to
make
an
elegant
costume
in
the
time
given
her
the
first
measurements
were
taken
and
we
drove
back
to
ninth
street
with
a
lasting
memory
in
my
mind
of
the
cold
and
rigid
form
of
miss
oliver
standing
up
in
madame
triangular
parlor
submitting
to
the
mechanical
touches
of
the
modiste
with
an
outward
composure
but
with
a
brooding
horror
in
her
eyes
that
bespoke
an
inward
torment
xxxix
the
watchful
eye
as
i
parted
with
miss
oliver
on
desberger
stoop
and
did
not
visit
her
again
in
that
house
i
will
introduce
the
report
of
a
person
better
situated
than
myself
to
observe
the
girl
during
the
next
few
days
that
the
person
thus
alluded
to
was
a
woman
in
the
service
of
the
police
is
evident
and
as
such
may
not
meet
with
your
approval
but
her
words
are
of
interest
as
witness
friday
party
went
out
in
company
with
an
elderly
female
of
respectable
appearance
said
elderly
female
wears
puffs
and
moves
with
great
precision
i
say
this
in
case
her
identification
should
prove
necessary
i
had
been
warned
that
miss
would
probably
go
out
and
as
the
man
set
to
watch
the
front
door
was
on
duty
i
occupied
myself
during
her
absence
in
making
a
neat
little
hole
in
the
partitions
between
our
two
rooms
so
that
i
should
not
be
obliged
to
offend
my
neighbor
by
too
frequent
visits
to
her
apartment
this
done
i
awaited
her
return
which
was
delayed
till
it
was
almost
dark
when
she
did
come
in
her
arms
were
full
of
bundles
these
she
thrust
into
a
with
the
exception
of
one
which
she
laid
with
great
care
under
her
pillow
i
wondered
what
this
one
could
be
but
could
get
no
inkling
from
its
size
or
shape
her
manner
when
she
took
off
her
hat
was
fiercer
than
before
and
a
strange
smile
which
i
had
not
previously
observed
on
her
lips
added
force
to
her
expression
but
it
paled
after
and
she
had
a
restless
night
i
could
hear
her
walk
the
floor
long
after
i
thought
it
prudent
on
my
part
to
retire
and
at
intervals
through
the
night
i
was
disturbed
by
her
moaning
which
was
not
that
of
a
sick
person
but
of
one
very
much
afflicted
in
mind
saturday
party
quiet
sits
most
of
the
time
with
hands
clasped
on
her
knee
before
the
fire
given
to
quick
starts
as
if
suddenly
awakened
from
an
absorbing
train
of
thought
a
pitiful
object
especially
when
seized
by
terror
as
she
is
at
odd
times
no
walks
no
visitors
once
i
heard
her
speak
some
words
in
a
strange
language
and
once
she
drew
herself
up
before
the
mirror
in
an
attitude
of
so
much
dignity
i
was
surprised
at
the
fine
appearance
she
made
the
fire
of
her
eyes
at
this
moment
was
remarkable
i
should
not
be
surprised
at
any
move
she
might
make
sunday
she
has
been
writing
but
when
she
had
filled
several
pages
of
letter
paper
she
suddenly
tore
them
all
up
and
threw
them
into
the
fire
time
seems
to
drag
with
her
for
she
goes
every
few
minutes
to
the
window
from
which
a
distant
church
clock
is
visible
and
sighs
as
she
turns
away
more
writing
in
the
evening
and
some
tears
but
the
writing
was
burned
as
before
and
the
tears
stopped
by
a
laugh
that
augurs
little
good
to
the
person
who
called
it
up
the
package
has
been
taken
from
under
her
pillow
and
put
in
some
place
not
visible
from
my
monday
party
out
again
gone
some
two
hours
or
more
when
she
returned
she
sat
down
before
the
mirror
and
began
dressing
her
hair
she
has
fine
hair
and
she
tried
arranging
it
in
several
ways
none
seemed
to
satisfy
her
and
she
tore
it
down
again
and
let
it
hang
till
when
she
wound
it
up
in
its
usual
simple
knot
desberger
spent
some
minutes
with
her
but
their
talk
was
far
from
confidential
and
therefore
uninteresting
i
wish
people
would
speak
louder
when
they
talk
to
themselves
tuesday
great
restlessness
on
the
part
of
the
young
person
i
am
watching
no
quiet
for
her
no
quiet
for
me
yet
she
accomplishes
nothing
and
as
yet
has
furnished
me
no
clue
to
her
thoughts
a
huge
box
was
brought
into
the
room
it
seemed
to
cause
her
dread
rather
than
pleasure
for
she
shrank
at
sight
of
it
and
has
not
yet
attempted
to
open
it
but
her
eyes
have
never
left
it
since
it
was
set
down
on
the
floor
it
looks
like
a
dressmaker
box
but
why
such
emotion
over
a
gown
wednesday
this
morning
she
opened
the
box
but
did
not
display
its
contents
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
a
mass
of
tissue
paper
and
then
she
put
the
cover
on
again
and
for
a
good
half
hour
sat
crouching
down
beside
it
shuddering
like
one
in
an
i
began
to
feel
there
was
something
deadly
in
the
box
her
eyes
wandered
towards
it
so
frequently
and
with
such
contradictory
looks
of
dread
and
savage
determination
when
she
got
up
it
was
to
see
how
many
more
minutes
of
the
wretched
day
had
passed
thursday
party
sick
did
not
try
to
leave
her
bed
breakfast
brought
up
by
desberger
who
showed
her
every
attention
but
could
not
prevail
upon
her
to
eat
yet
she
would
not
let
the
tray
be
taken
away
and
when
she
was
alone
again
or
thought
herself
alone
she
let
her
eyes
rest
so
long
on
the
knife
lying
across
her
plate
that
i
grew
nervous
and
could
hardly
restrain
myself
from
rushing
into
the
room
but
i
remembered
my
instructions
and
kept
still
even
when
i
saw
her
hand
steal
towards
this
possible
weapon
though
i
kept
my
own
on
the
which
fortunately
hung
at
my
side
she
looked
quite
capable
of
wounding
herself
with
the
knife
but
after
balancing
it
a
moment
in
her
hand
she
laid
it
down
again
and
turned
with
a
low
moan
to
the
wall
she
will
not
attempt
death
till
she
has
accomplished
what
is
in
her
mind
friday
all
is
right
in
the
next
room
that
is
the
young
lady
is
up
but
there
is
another
change
in
her
appearance
since
last
night
she
has
grown
contemptuous
of
herself
and
indulges
less
in
brooding
but
her
impatience
at
the
slow
passage
of
time
continues
and
her
interest
in
the
box
is
even
greater
than
before
she
does
not
open
it
however
only
looks
at
it
and
lays
her
trembling
hand
now
and
then
on
the
cover
saturday
a
blank
day
party
dull
and
very
quiet
her
eyes
begin
to
look
like
ghastly
hollows
in
her
pale
face
she
talks
to
herself
continually
but
in
a
low
mechanical
way
exceedingly
wearing
to
the
listener
especially
as
no
word
can
be
distinguished
tried
to
see
her
in
her
own
room
but
she
would
not
admit
me
sunday
i
have
noticed
from
the
first
a
bible
lying
on
one
end
of
her
she
noticed
it
also
and
impulsively
reached
out
her
hand
to
take
it
down
but
at
the
first
word
she
read
she
gave
a
low
cry
and
hastily
closed
the
book
and
put
it
back
later
however
she
took
it
again
and
read
several
chapters
the
result
was
a
softening
in
her
manner
but
she
went
to
bed
as
flushed
and
determined
as
ever
monday
she
has
walked
the
floor
all
day
she
has
seen
no
one
and
seems
scarcely
able
to
contain
her
impatience
she
can
not
stand
this
long
tuesday
my
surprises
began
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
her
room
had
been
put
in
order
miss
locked
the
door
and
began
to
open
her
bundles
first
she
unrolled
a
pair
of
white
silk
stockings
which
she
carefully
but
without
any
show
of
interest
laid
on
the
bed
then
she
opened
a
package
containing
gloves
they
were
white
also
and
evidently
of
the
finest
quality
then
a
lace
handkerchief
was
brought
to
light
slippers
an
evening
fan
and
a
pair
of
fancy
pins
and
lastly
she
opened
the
mysterious
box
and
took
out
a
dress
so
rich
in
quality
and
of
such
simple
elegance
it
almost
took
my
breath
away
it
was
white
and
made
of
the
heaviest
satin
and
it
looked
as
much
out
of
place
in
that
shabby
room
as
its
owner
did
in
the
moments
of
exaltation
of
which
i
have
spoken
though
her
face
was
flushed
when
she
lifted
out
the
gown
it
became
pale
again
when
she
saw
it
lying
across
her
bed
indeed
a
look
of
passionate
abhorrence
characterized
her
features
as
she
contemplated
it
and
her
hands
went
up
before
her
eyes
and
she
reeled
back
uttering
the
first
words
i
have
been
able
to
distinguish
since
i
have
been
on
duty
they
were
violent
in
character
and
seemed
to
tear
their
way
through
her
lips
almost
without
her
volition
is
hate
i
feel
nothing
but
hate
ah
if
it
were
only
duty
that
animated
me
later
she
grew
calmer
and
covering
up
the
whole
paraphernalia
with
a
stray
sheet
she
had
evidently
laid
by
for
the
purpose
she
sent
for
desberger
when
that
lady
came
in
she
met
her
with
a
wan
but
by
no
means
dubious
smile
and
ignoring
with
quiet
dignity
the
very
evident
curiosity
with
which
that
good
woman
surveyed
the
bed
she
said
appealingly
have
been
so
kind
to
me
desberger
that
i
am
going
to
tell
you
a
secret
will
it
continue
to
remain
a
secret
or
shall
i
see
it
in
the
faces
of
all
my
you
can
imagine
desberger
reply
also
the
manner
in
which
it
was
delivered
but
not
miss
oliver
secret
she
uttered
it
in
these
words
am
going
out
desberger
i
am
going
into
great
society
i
am
going
to
attend
miss
althorpe
wedding
then
as
the
good
woman
stammered
out
some
words
of
surprise
and
pleasure
she
went
on
to
say
do
not
want
any
one
to
know
it
and
i
would
be
so
glad
if
i
could
slip
out
of
the
house
without
any
one
seeing
me
i
shall
need
a
carriage
but
you
will
get
one
for
me
will
you
not
and
let
me
know
the
moment
it
comes
i
am
shy
of
what
folks
say
and
besides
as
you
know
i
am
neither
happy
nor
well
if
i
do
go
to
weddings
and
have
new
dresses
and
she
nearly
broke
down
but
collected
herself
with
wonderful
promptitude
and
with
a
coaxing
look
that
made
her
almost
ghastly
so
much
it
seemed
out
of
accord
with
her
strained
and
unnatural
manner
she
raised
a
corner
of
the
sheet
saying
will
show
you
my
gown
if
you
will
promise
to
help
me
quietly
out
of
the
house
which
of
course
produced
the
desired
effect
upon
desberger
that
woman
greatest
weakness
being
her
love
of
dress
so
from
that
hour
i
knew
what
to
expect
and
after
sending
precautionary
advices
to
police
headquarters
i
set
myself
to
watch
her
prepare
for
the
evening
i
saw
her
arrange
her
hair
and
put
on
her
elegant
gown
and
was
as
much
startled
by
the
result
as
if
i
had
not
had
the
least
premonition
that
she
only
needed
rich
clothes
to
look
both
beautiful
and
distinguished
the
square
parcel
she
had
once
hidden
under
her
pillow
was
brought
out
and
laid
on
the
bed
and
when
desberger
low
knock
announced
the
arrival
of
the
carriage
she
caught
it
up
and
hid
it
under
the
cloak
she
hastily
threw
about
her
desberger
came
in
and
put
out
the
light
but
before
the
room
sank
into
darkness
i
caught
one
glimpse
of
miss
oliver
face
its
expression
was
terrible
beyond
anything
i
had
ever
seen
on
any
human
countenance
xl
as
the
clock
struck
i
do
not
attend
weddings
in
general
but
great
as
my
suspense
was
in
reference
to
miss
oliver
i
felt
that
i
could
not
miss
seeing
miss
althorpe
married
i
had
ordered
a
new
dress
for
the
occasion
and
was
in
the
best
of
spirits
as
i
rode
to
the
church
in
which
the
ceremony
was
to
be
performed
the
excitement
of
a
great
social
occasion
was
for
once
not
disagreeable
to
me
nor
did
i
mind
the
crowd
though
it
pushed
me
about
rather
uncomfortably
till
an
usher
came
to
my
assistance
and
seated
me
in
a
pew
which
i
was
happy
to
see
commanded
a
fine
view
of
the
chancel
i
was
early
but
then
i
always
am
early
and
having
ample
opportunity
for
observation
i
noted
every
fine
detail
of
ornamentation
with
approval
miss
althorpe
taste
being
of
that
fine
order
which
always
falls
short
of
ostentation
her
friends
are
in
very
many
instances
my
friends
and
it
was
no
small
part
of
my
pleasure
to
note
their
faces
among
the
crowd
of
those
that
were
strange
to
me
that
the
scene
was
brilliant
and
that
silks
satins
and
diamonds
abounded
goes
without
saying
at
last
the
church
was
full
and
the
hush
which
usually
precedes
the
coming
of
the
bride
was
settling
over
the
whole
assemblage
when
i
suddenly
observed
in
the
person
of
a
gentleman
seated
in
a
side
pew
the
form
and
features
of
gryce
the
detective
this
was
a
shock
to
me
yet
what
was
there
in
his
presence
there
to
alarm
me
might
not
miss
althorpe
have
accorded
him
this
pleasure
out
of
the
pure
goodness
of
her
heart
i
did
not
look
at
anybody
else
however
after
once
my
eyes
fell
upon
him
but
continued
to
watch
his
expression
which
was
though
a
little
anxious
for
one
engaged
in
a
purely
social
function
the
entrance
of
the
clergyman
and
the
sudden
peal
of
the
organ
in
the
wedding
march
recalled
my
attention
to
the
occasion
itself
and
as
at
that
moment
the
bridegroom
stepped
from
the
vestry
to
await
his
bride
at
the
altar
i
was
absorbed
by
his
fine
appearance
and
the
air
of
mingled
pride
and
happiness
with
which
he
watched
the
stately
approach
of
the
bridal
procession
but
suddenly
there
was
a
stir
through
the
whole
glittering
assemblage
and
the
clergyman
made
a
move
and
the
bridegroom
gave
a
start
and
the
sound
slight
as
it
was
of
moving
feet
grew
still
and
i
saw
advancing
from
the
door
on
the
opposite
side
of
the
altar
a
second
bride
clad
in
white
and
surrounded
by
a
long
veil
which
completely
hid
her
face
a
second
bride
and
the
first
was
up
the
aisle
and
only
one
bridegroom
stood
ready
the
clergyman
who
seemed
to
have
as
little
command
of
his
faculties
as
the
rest
of
us
tried
to
speak
but
the
approaching
woman
upon
whom
every
regard
was
fixed
forestalled
him
by
an
authoritative
gesture
advancing
towards
the
chancel
she
took
her
place
on
the
spot
reserved
for
miss
althorpe
silence
had
filled
the
church
up
to
this
moment
but
at
this
audacious
move
a
solitary
wailing
cry
of
mingled
astonishment
and
despair
went
up
behind
us
but
before
any
of
us
could
turn
and
while
my
own
heart
stood
still
for
i
thought
i
recognized
this
veiled
figure
the
woman
at
the
altar
raised
her
hand
and
pointed
towards
the
bridegroom
why
does
he
hesitate
she
cried
does
he
not
recognize
the
only
woman
with
whom
he
dare
face
god
and
man
at
the
altar
because
i
am
already
his
wedded
wife
and
have
been
so
for
five
long
years
does
that
make
my
wearing
of
this
veil
amiss
when
he
a
husband
unreleased
by
the
law
dares
enter
this
sacred
place
with
the
hope
and
expectation
of
a
bridegroom
it
was
ruth
oliver
who
spoke
i
recognized
her
voice
as
i
had
recognized
her
apparel
but
the
emotions
aroused
in
me
by
her
presence
and
the
almost
incredible
claims
she
advanced
were
lost
in
the
horror
inspired
by
the
man
she
thus
vehemently
accused
no
lost
spirit
from
the
pit
could
have
shown
a
more
hideous
commingling
of
the
most
terrible
passions
known
to
man
than
he
did
in
the
face
of
this
terrible
arraignment
and
if
ella
althorpe
cowering
in
her
shame
and
misery
up
the
aisle
saw
him
in
all
his
depravity
at
that
instant
as
i
did
nothing
could
have
saved
her
love
from
immediate
death
yet
he
tried
to
speak
it
is
false
he
cried
all
false
the
woman
i
once
called
wife
is
dead
dead
olive
randolph
murderer
she
exclaimed
the
blow
struck
in
the
dark
found
another
victim
and
pulling
the
veil
from
her
face
ruth
oliver
advanced
to
his
side
and
laid
her
trembling
hand
with
a
firm
and
decisive
movement
on
his
arm
was
it
her
words
her
touch
or
the
sound
of
the
clock
striking
eight
in
the
great
tower
over
our
heads
which
so
totally
overwhelmed
him
as
the
last
stroke
of
the
hour
which
was
to
have
seen
him
united
with
miss
althorpe
died
out
in
the
awed
spaces
above
him
he
gave
a
cry
such
as
i
am
sure
never
resounded
between
those
sacred
walls
before
and
sank
in
a
heap
on
the
spot
where
but
a
few
minutes
previous
he
had
lifted
his
head
in
all
the
glow
and
pride
of
a
prospective
bridegroom
xli
secret
history
it
was
hours
before
i
found
myself
able
to
realize
that
the
scene
i
had
just
witnessed
had
a
deeper
and
much
more
dreadful
significance
than
appeared
to
the
general
eye
and
that
ruth
oliver
in
her
desperate
interruption
of
these
treacherous
nuptials
had
not
only
made
good
her
prior
claim
to
randolph
stone
as
her
husband
but
had
pointed
him
out
to
all
the
world
as
the
villainous
author
of
that
crime
which
for
so
long
a
time
had
occupied
my
own
and
the
public
attention
thinking
that
you
may
find
the
same
difficulty
in
grasping
this
terrible
fact
and
being
anxious
to
save
you
from
the
suspense
under
which
i
myself
labored
for
so
many
hours
i
here
subjoin
a
written
statement
made
by
this
woman
some
weeks
later
in
which
the
whole
mystery
is
explained
it
is
signed
olive
randolph
the
name
to
which
she
evidently
feels
herself
best
entitled
the
man
known
in
new
york
city
as
randolph
stone
was
first
seen
by
me
in
michigan
five
years
ago
his
name
then
was
john
randolph
and
how
he
has
since
come
to
add
to
this
the
further
appellation
of
stone
i
must
leave
to
himself
to
explain
i
was
born
in
michigan
myself
and
till
my
eighteenth
year
i
lived
with
my
father
who
was
a
widower
without
any
other
child
in
a
little
low
cottage
amid
the
sand
mounds
that
border
the
eastern
side
of
the
lake
i
was
not
pretty
but
every
man
who
passed
me
on
the
beach
or
in
the
streets
of
the
little
town
where
we
went
to
market
and
to
church
stopped
to
look
at
me
and
this
i
noticed
and
from
this
perhaps
my
unhappiness
arose
for
before
i
was
old
enough
to
know
the
difference
between
poverty
and
riches
i
began
to
lose
all
interest
in
my
simple
home
duties
and
to
cast
longing
looks
at
the
great
school
building
where
girls
like
myself
learned
to
speak
like
ladies
and
play
the
piano
yet
these
ambitious
promptings
might
have
come
to
nothing
if
i
had
never
met
i
might
have
settled
down
in
my
own
sphere
and
lived
a
useful
if
unsatisfied
life
like
my
mother
and
my
mother
mother
before
her
but
fate
had
reserved
me
for
wretchedness
and
one
day
just
as
i
was
on
the
verge
of
my
eighteenth
year
i
saw
john
randolph
i
was
coming
out
of
church
when
our
eyes
first
met
and
i
noticed
after
the
first
shock
my
simple
heart
received
from
his
handsome
face
and
elegant
appearance
that
he
was
surveying
me
with
that
strange
look
of
admiration
i
had
seen
before
on
so
many
faces
and
the
joy
this
gave
me
and
the
certainty
which
came
with
it
of
my
seeing
him
again
made
that
moment
quite
unlike
any
other
in
my
whole
life
and
was
the
beginning
of
that
passion
which
has
undone
me
ruined
him
and
brought
death
and
sorrow
to
many
others
of
more
worth
than
either
of
us
he
was
not
a
resident
of
the
town
but
a
passing
visitor
and
his
intention
had
been
as
he
has
since
told
me
to
leave
the
place
on
the
following
day
but
the
dart
which
had
pierced
my
breast
had
not
glanced
entirely
aside
from
his
and
he
remained
as
he
declared
to
see
what
there
was
in
this
little
face
to
make
it
so
unforgettable
we
met
first
on
the
beach
and
afterwards
under
the
strip
of
pines
which
separate
our
cottage
from
the
sand
mounds
and
though
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
he
came
to
these
interviews
with
any
honest
purpose
or
deep
sincerity
of
feeling
it
is
certain
he
exerted
all
his
powers
to
make
them
memorable
to
me
and
that
in
doing
so
he
awoke
some
of
the
fire
in
his
own
breast
which
he
took
such
wicked
pleasure
in
arousing
in
mine
in
fact
he
soon
showed
that
this
was
so
for
i
could
take
no
step
from
the
house
without
encountering
him
and
the
one
indelible
impression
remaining
to
me
from
those
days
is
the
expression
his
face
wore
as
one
sunny
afternoon
he
laid
my
hand
on
his
arm
and
drew
me
away
to
have
a
look
at
the
lake
booming
on
the
beach
below
us
there
was
no
love
in
it
as
i
understand
love
now
but
the
passion
which
informed
it
almost
amounted
to
intoxication
and
if
such
a
passion
can
be
understood
between
a
man
already
cultivated
and
a
girl
who
hardly
knew
how
to
read
it
may
in
a
measure
account
for
what
followed
my
father
who
was
no
fool
and
who
saw
the
selfish
quality
in
this
attractive
lover
of
mine
was
alarmed
by
our
growing
intimacy
taking
an
opportunity
when
we
were
both
in
a
more
sensible
mood
than
common
he
put
the
case
before
randolph
in
a
very
decided
way
he
told
him
that
either
he
must
marry
me
at
once
or
quit
seeing
me
altogether
no
delay
was
to
be
considered
and
no
compromise
allowed
as
my
father
was
a
man
with
whom
no
one
ever
disputed
john
randolph
prepared
to
leave
the
town
declaring
that
he
could
marry
no
one
at
that
stage
of
his
career
but
before
he
could
carry
out
his
intention
the
old
intoxication
returned
and
he
came
back
in
a
fever
of
love
and
impatience
to
marry
me
had
i
been
older
or
more
experienced
in
the
ways
of
the
world
i
would
have
known
that
such
passion
as
this
evinced
was
that
there
is
no
witchery
in
a
smile
lasting
enough
to
make
men
like
him
forget
the
lack
of
those
social
graces
to
which
they
are
accustomed
but
i
was
mad
with
happiness
and
was
unconscious
of
any
cloud
lowering
upon
our
future
till
the
day
of
our
first
separation
came
when
an
event
occurred
which
showed
me
what
i
might
expect
if
i
could
not
speedily
raise
myself
to
his
level
we
were
out
walking
and
we
met
a
lady
who
had
known
randolph
elsewhere
she
was
well
dressed
which
i
was
not
though
i
had
not
realized
it
till
i
saw
how
attractive
she
looked
in
quiet
colors
and
with
only
a
simple
ribbon
on
her
hat
and
she
had
besides
a
way
of
speaking
which
made
my
tones
sound
harsh
and
robbed
me
of
that
feeling
of
superiority
with
which
i
had
hitherto
regarded
all
the
girls
of
my
acquaintance
but
it
was
not
her
possession
of
these
advantages
keenly
as
i
felt
them
which
awakened
me
to
the
sense
of
my
position
it
was
the
surprise
she
showed
a
surprise
the
source
of
which
was
not
to
be
mistaken
when
he
introduced
me
to
her
as
his
wife
and
though
she
recovered
herself
in
a
moment
and
tried
to
be
kind
and
gracious
i
felt
the
sting
of
it
and
saw
that
he
felt
it
too
and
consequently
was
not
at
all
astonished
when
after
she
had
passed
us
he
turned
and
looked
at
me
critically
for
the
first
time
but
his
way
of
showing
his
dissatisfaction
gave
me
a
shock
it
took
me
years
to
recover
from
off
that
hat
he
cried
and
when
i
had
obeyed
him
he
tore
out
the
spray
which
to
my
eyes
had
been
its
chief
adornment
and
threw
it
into
some
bushes
near
by
then
he
gave
me
back
the
hat
and
asked
for
the
silk
neckerchief
which
i
had
regarded
as
the
glory
of
my
bridal
costume
giving
it
to
him
i
saw
him
put
it
in
his
pocket
and
understanding
now
that
he
was
trying
to
make
me
look
more
like
the
lady
we
had
passed
i
cried
out
passionately
is
not
these
things
that
make
the
difference
john
but
my
voice
and
way
of
walking
and
speaking
give
me
money
and
let
me
be
educated
and
then
we
will
see
if
any
other
woman
can
draw
your
eyes
away
from
me
but
he
had
received
a
shock
that
made
him
cruel
can
not
make
a
silk
purse
out
of
a
sow
ear
he
sneered
and
was
silent
all
the
rest
of
the
way
home
i
was
silent
too
for
i
never
talk
when
i
am
angry
but
when
we
arrived
in
our
own
little
room
i
confronted
him
you
going
to
say
any
more
such
cruel
things
to
me
i
asked
if
you
are
i
should
like
you
to
say
them
now
and
be
done
with
it
he
looked
desperately
angry
but
there
was
yet
a
little
love
left
in
his
heart
for
me
for
he
laughed
after
he
had
looked
at
me
for
a
minute
and
took
me
in
his
arms
and
said
some
of
the
fine
things
with
which
he
had
previously
won
my
heart
but
not
with
the
old
fire
and
not
with
the
old
effect
upon
me
yet
my
love
had
not
grown
cold
it
had
only
changed
from
the
unthinking
stage
to
the
thinking
one
and
i
was
quite
in
earnest
when
i
said
know
i
am
not
as
pretty
or
as
nice
as
the
ladies
you
are
accustomed
to
but
i
have
a
heart
that
has
never
known
any
other
passion
than
its
love
for
you
and
from
such
a
heart
you
ought
to
expect
a
lady
to
grow
and
there
will
only
give
me
the
chance
john
only
let
me
learn
to
read
and
write
but
he
was
in
an
incredulous
state
of
mind
and
it
ended
in
his
going
away
without
making
any
arrangements
for
my
education
he
was
bound
for
san
francisco
where
he
had
business
to
transact
and
he
promised
to
be
back
in
four
weeks
but
before
the
four
weeks
elapsed
he
wrote
me
that
it
would
be
five
and
later
on
that
it
would
be
six
and
afterwards
that
it
would
be
when
he
had
finished
a
big
piece
of
work
he
was
engaged
upon
and
which
would
bring
him
a
large
amount
of
money
i
believed
him
and
i
doubted
him
at
the
same
time
but
i
was
not
altogether
sorry
he
delayed
his
return
for
i
had
begun
school
on
my
own
account
and
was
fast
laying
the
foundation
of
a
solid
education
my
means
came
from
my
father
who
now
it
was
too
late
saw
the
necessity
of
my
improving
myself
the
amount
of
studying
i
did
that
first
year
was
amazing
but
it
was
nothing
to
what
i
went
through
the
second
for
my
husband
letters
had
begun
to
fail
me
and
i
was
forced
to
work
in
order
to
drown
grief
and
keep
myself
from
despair
finally
no
letters
came
at
all
and
when
the
second
year
was
over
and
i
could
at
least
express
myself
correctly
i
woke
to
the
realization
that
so
far
as
my
husband
was
concerned
i
had
gone
through
all
this
labor
for
nothing
and
that
unless
by
some
fortunate
chance
i
could
light
upon
some
clue
to
his
whereabouts
in
the
great
world
beyond
our
little
town
i
would
be
likely
to
pass
the
remainder
of
my
days
in
widowhood
and
desolation
my
father
dying
at
this
time
and
leaving
me
a
thousand
dollars
i
knew
no
better
way
of
spending
it
than
in
the
hopeless
search
i
have
just
mentioned
accordingly
after
his
burial
i
started
out
on
my
travels
gaining
experience
with
every
mile
i
had
not
been
away
a
week
before
i
realized
what
a
folly
i
had
indulged
in
in
ever
hoping
to
see
john
randolph
back
at
my
side
i
saw
the
homes
in
which
such
men
as
he
lived
and
met
in
cars
and
on
steamboats
the
kind
of
people
with
whom
he
must
associate
to
be
happy
and
a
gulf
seemed
to
open
between
us
which
even
such
love
as
mine
would
be
powerless
to
bridge
but
though
hope
thus
sank
in
my
breast
i
did
not
lose
my
old
ambition
of
making
myself
as
worthy
of
him
as
circumstances
would
permit
i
read
only
the
best
books
and
i
allowed
myself
to
become
acquainted
with
only
the
best
people
and
as
i
saw
myself
liked
by
such
the
awkwardness
of
my
manner
gradually
disappeared
and
i
began
to
feel
that
the
day
would
come
when
i
should
be
universally
recognized
as
a
lady
meantime
i
did
not
advance
an
iota
in
the
object
of
my
journey
and
at
last
with
every
expectation
gone
of
ever
seeing
my
husband
again
i
made
my
way
to
toledo
here
i
speedily
found
employment
and
what
was
better
still
to
one
of
my
ambitious
tendencies
an
opportunity
to
add
to
the
sum
of
my
accomplishments
a
knowledge
of
french
and
music
the
french
i
learned
from
the
family
i
lived
with
and
the
music
from
a
professor
in
the
same
house
whose
love
for
his
pet
art
was
so
great
that
he
found
it
simple
happiness
to
impart
it
to
one
so
greedy
for
improvement
as
myself
here
in
course
of
time
i
also
learned
and
it
was
for
the
purpose
of
seeking
employment
in
this
capacity
that
i
finally
came
to
new
york
this
was
three
months
ago
i
was
in
complete
ignorance
of
the
city
when
i
entered
it
and
for
a
day
or
two
i
wandered
to
and
fro
searching
for
a
suitable
it
was
while
i
was
on
my
way
to
desberger
that
i
saw
advancing
towards
me
a
gentleman
in
whose
air
and
manner
i
detected
a
resemblance
to
the
husband
who
some
five
years
since
had
deserted
me
the
shock
was
too
much
for
my
quaking
in
every
limb
i
stood
awaiting
his
approach
and
when
he
came
up
to
me
and
i
saw
by
his
startled
recognition
of
me
that
it
was
indeed
he
i
gave
a
loud
cry
and
threw
myself
upon
his
arm
the
start
he
gave
was
nothing
to
the
frightful
expression
which
crossed
his
face
at
this
encounter
but
i
thought
both
due
to
his
surprise
though
now
i
am
convinced
they
had
their
origin
in
the
deepest
and
worst
emotions
of
which
a
man
is
capable
john
i
cried
and
could
say
no
more
for
the
agitations
of
five
solitary
despairing
years
were
choking
me
but
he
was
entirely
voiceless
stricken
i
have
no
doubt
beyond
any
power
of
mine
to
realize
how
could
i
dream
that
in
consideration
power
and
prestige
he
had
advanced
even
more
rapidly
than
myself
and
that
at
this
very
moment
he
was
not
only
the
idol
of
society
but
on
the
verge
of
uniting
himself
to
a
woman
i
will
not
say
of
marrying
her
for
marry
her
he
could
not
while
i
lived
who
would
make
him
the
envied
possessor
of
millions
such
fortune
such
daring
yes
and
such
depravity
were
beyond
the
reach
of
my
imagination
and
while
i
thought
his
pleasure
less
than
mine
i
did
not
dream
that
my
existence
was
a
menace
to
all
his
hopes
and
that
during
this
moment
of
speechlessness
he
was
sounding
his
nature
for
means
to
rid
himself
of
me
even
at
the
cost
of
my
life
his
first
movement
was
to
push
me
away
but
i
clung
to
him
all
the
harder
at
which
his
whole
manner
changed
and
he
began
to
make
futile
efforts
to
calm
me
and
lead
me
away
from
the
spot
seeing
that
these
attempts
were
unavailing
he
turned
pale
and
raised
his
arm
up
passionately
but
speedily
dropped
it
again
and
casting
glances
this
way
and
that
broke
suddenly
into
a
loud
laugh
and
became
as
by
the
touch
of
a
magician
wand
my
old
lover
again
olive
he
cried
olive
is
it
you
did
i
say
my
name
was
olive
happily
met
my
dear
i
did
not
know
what
i
had
been
missing
all
these
years
but
now
i
know
it
was
you
will
you
come
with
me
or
shall
i
go
home
with
you
have
no
home
said
i
have
just
come
into
town
i
see
but
one
alternative
he
smiled
and
what
a
power
there
was
in
his
smile
when
he
chose
to
exert
it
must
come
to
my
apartments
are
you
willing
am
your
wife
i
answered
he
had
taken
me
on
his
arm
by
this
time
and
the
recoil
he
made
at
these
words
was
quite
perceptible
but
his
face
still
smiled
and
i
was
too
mad
with
joy
to
be
critical
a
very
pretty
and
charming
wife
you
have
become
said
he
drawing
me
on
for
a
few
steps
suddenly
he
paused
and
i
felt
the
old
shadow
fall
between
us
again
your
dress
is
very
shabby
he
remarked
it
was
not
it
was
not
near
as
shabby
as
the
linen
duster
he
himself
wore
that
rain
he
inquired
looking
up
as
a
drop
or
two
fell
it
is
raining
well
let
us
go
into
this
store
we
are
coming
to
and
buy
a
gossamer
that
will
cover
up
your
gown
i
can
not
take
you
to
my
house
dressed
as
you
are
now
surprised
for
i
had
thought
my
dress
very
neat
and
but
never
dreaming
of
questioning
his
taste
any
more
than
in
the
old
days
in
michigan
i
went
with
him
into
the
shop
he
had
pointed
out
and
bought
me
a
gossamer
for
which
he
paid
when
he
had
helped
me
to
put
it
on
and
had
tied
my
veil
well
over
my
face
he
seemed
more
at
his
ease
and
gave
me
his
arm
quite
cheerfully
said
he
look
well
but
how
about
the
time
when
you
will
have
to
take
the
gossamer
off
i
tell
you
what
it
is
my
dear
you
will
have
to
refit
yourself
entirely
before
i
shall
be
satisfied
and
again
i
saw
him
cast
about
him
that
furtive
and
inquiring
look
which
would
have
awakened
more
surprise
in
me
than
it
did
had
i
known
that
we
were
in
a
part
of
the
city
where
he
ran
but
little
chance
of
meeting
any
one
he
knew
old
duster
i
have
on
he
suddenly
laughed
a
very
appropriate
companion
to
your
gossamer
and
though
i
did
not
agree
with
him
for
my
clothes
were
new
and
his
old
and
shabby
i
laughed
also
and
never
dreamed
of
evil
as
this
garment
which
so
disfigured
him
that
morning
has
been
the
occasion
of
much
false
speculation
on
the
part
of
those
whose
business
it
was
to
inquire
into
the
crime
with
which
it
is
in
a
most
unhappy
way
connected
i
may
as
well
explain
here
and
now
why
so
fastidious
a
gentleman
as
randolph
stone
came
to
wear
it
the
gentleman
called
howard
van
burnam
was
not
the
only
person
who
visited
the
van
burnam
offices
on
the
morning
preceding
the
murder
randolph
stone
was
there
also
but
he
did
not
see
the
brothers
for
finding
them
closeted
together
he
decided
not
to
interrupt
them
as
he
was
a
frequent
visitor
there
his
presence
created
no
remark
nor
was
his
departure
noted
descending
the
stairs
separating
the
offices
from
the
street
he
was
about
to
leave
the
building
when
he
noticed
that
the
clouds
looked
ominous
being
dressed
for
a
luncheon
with
miss
althorpe
he
felt
averse
to
getting
wet
so
he
stepped
back
into
the
adjoining
hall
and
began
groping
for
an
umbrella
in
a
little
closet
under
the
stairs
where
he
had
once
before
found
such
an
article
while
doing
this
he
heard
the
younger
van
burnam
descend
and
go
out
and
realizing
that
he
could
now
see
franklin
without
difficulty
he
was
about
to
return
when
he
heard
that
gentleman
also
come
down
and
follow
his
brother
into
the
street
his
first
impulse
was
to
join
him
but
finding
nothing
but
an
old
duster
in
the
closet
he
gave
up
this
intention
and
putting
on
this
shabby
but
protecting
garment
started
for
his
apartments
little
realizing
into
what
a
course
of
duplicity
and
crime
it
was
destined
to
lead
him
for
to
the
wearing
of
this
old
duster
on
this
especial
morning
innocent
as
the
occasion
was
i
attribute
john
temptation
to
murder
had
he
gone
out
without
it
he
would
have
taken
his
usual
course
up
broadway
and
never
met
or
even
if
he
had
taken
the
same
roundabout
way
to
his
apartments
as
that
which
led
to
our
encounter
he
would
never
have
dared
in
his
ordinary
fine
dress
conspicuous
as
it
made
him
to
have
entered
upon
those
measures
which
as
he
is
clever
enough
to
know
lead
to
disgrace
if
they
do
not
end
in
a
felon
cell
it
was
john
randolph
then
or
randolph
stone
as
he
is
pleased
to
call
himself
in
new
york
and
not
franklin
van
burnam
who
had
doubtless
proceeded
in
another
direction
who
came
up
to
where
howard
had
stood
saw
the
keys
he
had
dropped
and
put
them
in
his
own
pocket
it
was
as
innocent
an
action
as
the
donning
of
the
duster
and
yet
it
was
fraught
with
the
worst
consequences
to
himself
and
others
being
of
the
same
height
and
complexion
as
franklin
van
burnam
and
both
gentlemen
wearing
at
that
time
a
moustache
my
husband
shaved
his
off
after
the
murder
the
mistakes
which
arose
out
of
this
strange
equipment
were
but
natural
seen
from
the
rear
or
in
the
of
a
they
might
look
alike
though
to
me
or
to
any
one
studying
them
well
their
faces
are
really
very
different
but
to
return
leading
me
through
streets
of
which
i
knew
nothing
he
presently
stopped
before
the
entrance
of
a
large
hotel
tell
you
what
olive
said
he
had
better
go
in
here
take
a
room
and
send
for
such
things
as
you
require
to
make
you
look
like
a
lady
as
i
had
no
objection
to
anything
which
kept
me
at
his
side
i
told
him
that
whatever
suited
him
suited
me
and
followed
him
quite
eagerly
into
the
office
i
did
not
know
then
that
this
hotel
was
a
one
not
having
had
experience
with
the
best
but
if
i
had
i
should
not
have
wondered
at
his
choice
for
there
was
nothing
in
his
appearance
as
i
have
already
intimated
or
in
his
manners
up
to
this
point
to
lead
me
to
think
he
was
one
of
the
city
great
swells
and
that
it
was
only
in
such
an
unfashionable
house
as
this
he
would
be
likely
to
pass
unrecognized
how
with
his
markedly
handsome
features
and
distinguished
bearing
he
managed
so
to
carry
himself
as
to
look
like
a
man
of
inferior
breeding
i
can
no
more
explain
than
i
can
the
singular
change
which
took
place
in
him
when
once
he
found
himself
in
the
midst
of
the
crowd
which
lounged
about
this
office
from
a
man
to
attract
all
eyes
he
became
at
once
a
man
to
attract
none
and
slouched
and
looked
so
ordinary
that
i
stared
at
him
in
astonishment
little
thinking
that
he
had
assumed
this
manner
as
a
disguise
seeing
me
at
a
loss
he
spoke
up
quite
peremptorily
us
keep
our
secret
olive
till
you
can
appear
in
the
world
and
look
here
darling
wo
you
go
to
the
desk
and
ask
for
a
room
i
am
no
hand
at
any
such
business
confounded
at
a
proposition
so
unexpected
but
too
much
under
the
spell
of
my
feelings
to
dispute
his
wishes
i
faltered
out
supposing
they
ask
me
to
register
at
which
he
gave
me
a
look
which
recalled
the
old
days
in
michigan
and
quietly
sneered
them
a
fictitious
name
you
have
learned
to
write
by
this
time
have
you
not
stung
by
his
taunt
but
more
in
love
with
him
than
ever
for
his
momentary
display
of
passion
had
made
him
look
both
masterful
and
handsome
i
went
up
to
the
desk
to
do
his
bidding
room
said
i
and
when
asked
to
write
our
names
in
the
book
that
lay
before
me
i
put
down
the
first
that
suggested
itself
i
wrote
with
my
gloves
on
which
was
why
the
writing
looked
so
queer
that
it
was
taken
for
a
disguised
hand
this
done
he
rejoined
me
and
we
went
and
i
was
too
happy
to
be
in
his
company
again
to
wonder
at
his
peculiarities
or
weigh
the
consequences
of
the
implicit
confidence
i
accorded
him
i
was
desperately
in
love
once
more
and
entered
into
every
plan
he
proposed
without
a
thought
beyond
the
joyous
present
he
was
so
handsome
without
his
hat
and
when
after
some
short
delay
he
threw
aside
the
duster
i
felt
myself
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
in
the
presence
of
a
finished
gentleman
then
his
manner
was
so
changed
he
was
so
like
his
oldest
and
best
self
so
dangerously
like
what
he
was
in
those
long
vanished
hours
under
the
pines
in
my
home
on
the
shores
of
lake
michigan
that
he
faltered
at
times
and
sank
into
strange
spells
of
silence
which
had
something
in
them
that
made
my
breath
come
fitfully
did
not
awaken
my
apprehension
or
rouse
in
me
more
than
a
passing
curiosity
i
thought
he
regretted
the
past
and
when
after
one
such
pause
in
our
conversation
he
drew
out
of
his
pocket
a
couple
of
keys
tied
together
with
a
string
and
surveyed
the
card
attached
to
them
with
a
strange
look
easily
enough
to
be
understood
by
me
now
i
only
laughed
at
his
abstraction
and
indulged
in
a
fresh
caress
to
make
him
more
mindful
of
my
presence
these
keys
were
the
ones
which
van
burnam
husband
had
dropped
and
which
he
had
picked
up
before
meeting
me
and
after
he
had
put
them
back
into
his
pocket
he
became
more
talkative
than
before
and
more
systematically
i
think
he
had
not
seen
his
way
clearly
till
this
moment
the
dark
and
dreadful
way
which
was
to
end
as
he
supposed
in
my
death
but
i
feared
nothing
suspected
nothing
such
deep
and
desperate
wickedness
as
he
was
planning
was
beyond
the
wildest
flight
of
my
imagination
when
he
insisted
upon
sending
for
a
complete
set
of
clothing
for
me
and
when
at
his
dictation
i
wrote
a
list
of
the
articles
i
wanted
i
thought
he
was
influenced
by
his
wish
as
my
husband
to
see
me
dressed
in
articles
of
his
own
buying
that
it
was
all
a
plot
to
rob
me
of
my
identity
could
not
strike
such
a
mind
as
mine
and
when
the
packages
came
and
were
received
by
him
in
the
sly
way
already
known
to
the
public
i
saw
nothing
in
his
caution
but
a
playful
display
of
mystery
that
was
to
end
in
my
romantic
establishment
in
a
home
of
love
and
luxury
or
rather
it
is
thus
that
i
account
for
my
conduct
now
and
yet
the
precaution
i
took
not
to
change
the
shoes
in
which
my
money
was
hidden
may
argue
that
i
was
not
without
some
underlying
doubt
of
his
complete
sincerity
but
if
so
i
hid
it
from
myself
and
as
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
from
him
also
doubtless
excusing
my
action
to
myself
by
considering
that
i
would
be
none
the
worse
off
for
a
few
dollars
of
my
own
even
if
he
was
my
husband
and
had
promised
me
no
end
of
pleasure
and
comfort
that
he
did
intend
to
make
me
happy
he
had
assured
me
more
than
once
indeed
before
we
had
been
long
in
this
hotel
room
he
informed
me
that
great
experiences
lay
before
me
that
he
had
prospered
much
in
the
last
five
years
and
had
now
a
house
of
his
own
to
offer
me
and
a
large
circle
of
friends
to
make
our
life
in
it
agreeable
will
go
to
our
house
said
he
have
not
been
living
in
it
lately
and
you
may
find
it
a
little
uncomfortable
but
we
will
remedy
that
anything
is
better
than
staying
here
under
a
false
name
and
i
can
not
take
you
to
my
bachelor
apartment
i
had
doubted
some
of
his
previous
statements
but
this
one
i
implicitly
believed
why
should
not
so
elegant
a
man
have
a
house
of
his
own
and
if
he
had
told
me
it
was
built
of
marble
and
hung
with
florentine
tapestries
i
should
still
have
credited
it
all
i
was
in
and
he
was
my
knight
of
romance
even
when
he
again
hung
his
head
in
leaving
the
hotel
and
looked
at
once
so
ordinary
and
uninteresting
the
ruse
he
made
use
of
to
cut
off
all
connection
between
ourselves
and
the
and
james
pope
who
had
registered
at
the
hotel
d
was
accepted
by
me
with
the
same
lack
of
suspicion
that
he
should
wish
to
carry
no
remembrance
of
our
old
life
into
our
new
home
i
thought
a
delightful
piece
of
folly
and
when
he
proposed
that
we
should
bequeath
my
gossamer
and
his
own
disfiguring
duster
to
the
coachman
in
whose
hack
we
were
then
riding
i
laughed
gleefully
and
helped
him
fold
them
up
and
place
them
under
the
cushions
though
i
did
wonder
why
he
cut
a
piece
out
of
the
neck
of
the
former
and
pouted
with
the
happy
freedom
of
a
woman
when
he
said
is
the
first
thing
i
ever
bought
for
you
and
i
am
just
foolish
enough
to
wish
to
preserve
this
much
of
it
for
a
keepsake
do
you
object
my
dear
as
i
was
conscious
of
cherishing
a
similar
folly
in
his
regard
and
could
have
pressed
even
that
old
duster
of
his
to
my
heart
i
offered
him
a
kiss
and
said
and
he
put
the
scrap
away
in
his
pocket
that
it
was
the
portion
on
which
was
stamped
the
name
of
the
firm
from
which
it
was
bought
did
not
occur
to
me
when
the
coach
stopped
he
urged
me
away
on
foot
in
a
direction
entirely
strange
to
me
saying
we
would
take
another
hack
as
soon
as
we
had
disposed
of
the
bundles
we
were
carrying
how
he
intended
to
do
this
i
did
not
know
but
presently
he
drew
me
towards
a
chinese
laundry
where
he
bade
me
leave
one
of
them
as
washing
and
the
other
he
dropped
before
the
opening
of
a
sewer
as
we
stepped
up
a
neighboring
and
still
i
did
not
suspect
our
ride
to
gramercy
park
was
short
but
during
it
he
had
time
to
put
a
bill
in
my
hand
and
tell
me
i
was
to
pay
the
driver
he
had
also
time
to
secure
the
weapon
upon
which
he
had
probably
had
his
eye
fixed
from
the
first
his
manner
of
doing
this
i
can
never
forgive
for
it
was
a
lover
manner
and
as
such
intended
to
deceive
and
cajole
me
drawing
my
head
down
on
his
shoulder
he
drew
off
my
veil
saying
that
it
was
the
only
article
left
of
my
own
buying
and
that
we
would
leave
it
behind
us
in
this
coach
as
we
had
left
the
gossamer
in
the
other
i
will
make
sure
that
no
other
woman
ever
wears
it
he
laughed
slitting
it
up
and
down
with
his
knife
when
this
was
done
he
kissed
me
and
then
while
my
heart
was
tender
and
the
warm
tears
stood
in
my
eyes
he
drew
out
the
pin
from
my
hat
meeting
my
remonstrances
with
the
assurance
that
he
hated
to
see
my
head
covered
and
that
no
hat
was
as
pretty
as
my
own
brown
hair
as
this
was
nonsense
and
as
the
coach
was
beginning
to
stop
i
shook
my
head
at
him
and
put
my
hat
on
again
but
he
had
dropped
the
pin
or
so
he
said
and
i
had
to
alight
without
it
when
i
had
paid
the
driver
and
the
coach
had
driven
off
i
had
a
chance
to
look
up
at
the
house
before
which
we
had
stopped
its
height
and
imposing
appearance
daunted
me
in
spite
of
the
great
expectations
i
had
formed
and
i
ran
up
the
stoop
after
him
in
a
condition
of
mingled
awe
and
wild
delight
that
was
the
poorest
preparation
possible
for
what
lay
before
me
in
the
dark
interior
we
were
entering
he
was
fumbling
nervously
in
the
keyhole
with
his
key
and
i
heard
a
whispered
oath
escape
him
but
presently
the
door
fell
back
and
we
stepped
in
to
what
looked
to
me
like
a
cavern
of
darkness
not
be
frightened
he
admonished
me
will
strike
a
light
in
a
moment
and
after
carefully
closing
the
street
door
behind
us
he
stretched
out
his
hand
to
take
mine
or
so
i
judge
for
i
heard
him
whisper
impatiently
are
you
i
was
on
the
threshold
of
the
parlor
to
which
i
had
groped
my
way
while
he
was
closing
the
front
door
so
i
whispered
back
but
found
voice
for
nothing
further
for
at
that
instant
i
heard
a
sound
proceeding
from
the
depths
of
darkness
in
front
of
me
and
was
so
struck
with
terror
that
i
fell
back
against
the
staircase
just
as
he
passed
me
and
entered
the
room
from
which
that
stealthy
noise
had
issued
he
whispered
and
went
stumbling
on
in
the
void
of
darkness
before
me
till
suddenly
by
some
power
i
can
not
explain
i
seemed
to
see
faintly
but
distinctly
and
as
if
with
my
mind
eye
rather
than
with
my
bodily
one
i
perceived
the
shadowy
form
of
a
woman
standing
in
the
space
before
him
and
beheld
him
suddenly
grasp
her
with
what
he
meant
to
be
a
loving
cry
but
which
to
my
ears
at
that
moment
sounded
strangely
ferocious
and
after
holding
her
a
moment
suddenly
release
her
at
which
she
uttered
one
low
curdling
moan
and
sank
at
his
feet
at
the
same
instant
i
heard
a
click
which
i
did
not
understand
then
but
which
i
now
know
to
have
been
the
head
of
the
striking
the
register
horrified
past
all
power
of
speech
and
action
for
i
saw
that
he
had
intended
this
blow
for
me
i
cowered
against
the
stairs
waiting
for
him
to
pass
out
this
he
did
not
do
at
once
though
the
delay
must
have
been
short
he
stopped
long
enough
by
the
prostrate
form
to
stir
it
with
his
foot
probably
to
see
if
life
was
extinct
but
no
longer
yet
it
seemed
an
eternity
before
i
perceived
him
groping
his
way
over
the
threshold
an
eternity
in
which
every
act
of
my
life
passed
before
me
and
every
word
and
every
expression
with
which
he
had
beguiled
me
came
to
rack
my
soul
and
made
the
horror
of
this
mad
awakening
greater
no
thought
of
her
or
of
the
guilt
with
which
he
had
forever
damned
his
soul
came
to
me
in
that
first
moment
of
misery
loss
escape
and
the
danger
in
which
i
still
stood
if
the
least
hint
reached
him
of
the
mistake
he
had
made
filled
my
mind
too
entirely
for
me
to
dwell
on
any
less
impersonal
theme
his
words
for
he
muttered
several
in
that
short
passage
out
showed
me
in
what
a
fools
paradise
i
had
been
revelling
and
how
certainly
i
had
turned
his
every
thought
towards
murder
when
i
seized
him
in
the
street
and
proclaimed
myself
his
wife
the
satisfaction
with
which
he
uttered
struck
gave
little
hint
of
remorse
and
the
gloating
delight
with
which
he
added
something
about
the
devil
having
assisted
him
to
make
it
a
safe
blow
as
well
as
a
deadly
one
was
proof
not
only
of
his
having
used
all
his
cunning
in
planning
this
crime
but
of
his
pleasure
in
its
apparent
success
that
he
continued
in
this
frame
of
mind
and
that
he
never
lost
confidence
in
the
precautions
he
had
taken
and
in
the
mystery
with
which
the
deed
was
surrounded
is
apparent
from
the
fact
that
he
revisited
the
van
burnam
office
on
the
following
morning
and
hung
again
on
its
accustomed
nail
the
keys
of
the
gramercy
park
house
when
the
front
door
had
closed
and
i
knew
that
he
had
gone
away
in
the
full
belief
that
it
was
my
form
he
had
left
lying
behind
him
on
that
midnight
floor
all
the
accumulated
terrors
of
the
situation
came
to
me
in
full
force
and
i
began
to
think
of
her
as
well
as
of
myself
and
longed
for
courage
to
approach
her
or
even
the
daring
to
call
out
for
help
but
the
thought
that
it
was
my
husband
who
had
committed
this
crime
held
me
and
though
i
soon
began
to
move
inch
by
inch
in
her
direction
it
was
some
time
before
i
could
so
far
overcome
my
terror
as
to
enter
the
room
where
she
lay
i
had
supposed
and
still
supposed
as
was
natural
after
seeing
him
open
the
door
with
the
keys
he
took
from
his
pocket
that
the
house
was
his
and
the
victim
a
member
of
his
own
household
but
when
after
innumerable
hesitations
and
a
bodily
shrinking
that
was
little
short
of
torment
i
managed
to
drag
myself
into
the
room
and
light
a
match
which
i
found
on
a
farther
i
saw
enough
in
the
general
appearance
of
the
rooms
and
of
the
figure
at
my
feet
to
make
me
doubt
the
truth
of
both
these
suppositions
yet
no
other
explanation
came
to
lighten
the
mystery
of
the
occasion
and
dazed
as
i
was
by
the
horror
of
my
position
and
the
mortal
dread
i
felt
of
the
man
who
in
one
instant
had
turned
the
heaven
of
my
love
into
a
hell
of
fathomless
horrors
i
soon
had
eyes
for
the
one
fact
only
that
the
woman
lying
before
me
was
sufficiently
like
myself
to
inspire
me
with
the
hope
of
preserving
my
secret
and
keeping
from
my
slayer
the
knowledge
of
my
having
escaped
the
doom
he
had
prepared
for
me
for
ascribe
it
to
what
motive
you
will
that
was
the
one
idea
now
dominating
my
mind
i
wanted
him
to
believe
me
dead
i
wanted
to
feel
that
all
connection
between
us
was
severed
forever
he
killed
me
by
killing
my
love
and
faith
in
him
he
had
murdered
the
better
part
of
myself
and
i
shrank
with
inconceivable
horror
from
anything
that
would
bring
me
again
under
his
eye
or
force
me
to
assert
claims
that
it
would
be
the
future
business
of
my
life
to
forget
when
the
first
match
went
out
i
had
not
courage
to
light
another
so
i
crept
away
in
the
darkness
to
listen
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs
there
was
no
sound
from
above
and
a
terrifying
sense
began
to
pervade
me
that
i
was
in
that
house
alone
yet
there
was
safety
in
the
thought
and
opportunity
for
what
i
was
planning
and
finally
under
the
stress
of
the
purpose
that
was
every
moment
developing
within
me
i
went
softly
and
listened
at
all
the
doors
till
i
was
certain
that
the
house
was
unoccupied
then
i
came
down
and
walked
resolutely
back
into
the
parlor
for
i
knew
if
i
allowed
any
time
to
pass
i
could
never
again
summon
up
strength
to
cross
its
grisly
threshold
yet
i
did
nothing
for
hours
but
crouch
in
one
of
its
dismal
corners
waiting
for
morning
that
i
did
not
go
mad
in
that
awful
interval
is
a
wonder
i
must
have
been
near
it
more
than
once
i
have
been
asked
and
miss
butterworth
has
been
asked
how
in
the
light
of
what
we
now
know
concerning
this
poor
victim
presence
there
we
account
for
her
being
in
the
darkness
and
showing
so
little
terror
at
our
entrance
and
stone
approach
account
for
it
in
this
way
two
matches
were
found
in
the
parlor
grate
one
i
flung
there
the
other
had
probably
been
used
by
her
to
light
the
gas
if
this
was
still
lighted
when
we
drove
up
as
it
may
have
been
then
alarmed
by
the
sound
of
the
stopping
coach
she
had
put
it
out
with
a
vague
idea
of
hiding
herself
till
she
knew
whether
it
was
the
old
gentleman
who
was
coming
or
only
her
suspicious
and
unreasonable
husband
if
it
was
not
lighted
then
she
was
probably
aroused
from
a
sleep
on
the
parlor
sofa
and
was
for
the
moment
too
dazed
to
cry
out
or
resent
an
embrace
she
had
not
time
to
understand
before
she
succumbed
to
the
cruel
stab
that
killed
her
miss
butterworth
however
thinks
that
the
poor
creature
took
the
intruder
for
franklin
till
she
heard
my
voice
when
she
probably
became
so
amazed
that
she
was
in
a
measure
paralyzed
and
found
it
impossible
to
move
or
cry
out
as
miss
butterworth
is
a
woman
of
great
discretion
i
should
think
her
explanation
the
truest
if
i
did
not
consider
her
a
little
prejudiced
against
van
burnam
but
to
return
to
myself
with
the
first
glimmer
of
light
that
came
through
the
closed
shutters
i
rose
and
began
my
dreadful
task
upheld
by
a
purpose
as
relentless
as
that
which
drove
the
author
of
this
horror
into
murder
i
stripped
the
body
and
put
upon
it
my
own
clothing
with
the
one
exception
of
the
shoes
then
when
i
had
myself
in
hers
i
steadied
up
my
heart
and
with
one
wild
pull
dragged
down
the
cabinet
upon
her
so
that
her
face
might
lose
its
traits
and
her
identification
become
impossible
how
i
had
strength
to
do
this
and
how
i
could
contemplate
the
result
without
shrieking
i
can
not
now
imagine
perhaps
i
was
hardly
human
at
this
crisis
perhaps
something
of
the
demon
which
had
informed
him
in
his
awful
work
had
entered
into
my
breast
making
this
thing
possible
i
only
know
that
i
did
what
i
have
said
and
did
it
calmly
more
than
that
that
i
had
mind
and
judgment
left
to
give
to
my
own
appearance
observing
that
the
dress
i
had
put
on
was
of
a
conspicuous
plaid
i
exchanged
the
skirt
portion
with
the
brown
silk
petticoat
under
it
and
when
i
observed
that
it
hung
below
the
other
as
of
course
it
would
i
went
through
the
house
till
i
came
upon
some
pins
with
which
i
pinned
it
up
out
of
sight
thus
equipped
i
was
still
a
person
to
attract
attention
especially
as
i
had
no
hat
to
put
on
my
own
having
fallen
from
my
head
and
been
covered
by
the
dead
woman
body
which
nothing
would
induce
me
to
move
again
but
i
had
confidence
in
my
own
powers
to
escape
question
toned
up
as
i
was
in
every
nerve
by
the
dreadfulness
of
my
situation
and
as
soon
as
i
was
in
decent
shape
for
flight
i
opened
the
front
door
and
prepared
to
slip
out
but
here
the
intense
dread
i
felt
of
my
husband
a
dread
which
had
actuated
all
my
movements
and
sustained
me
in
as
harrowing
a
task
as
ever
woman
performed
seized
me
with
renewed
force
and
i
quailed
at
the
prospect
of
entering
the
streets
alone
supposing
he
should
be
on
the
stoop
supposing
he
should
be
in
an
opposite
window
even
could
i
encounter
him
again
and
live
he
was
not
far
away
or
so
i
felt
a
murderer
it
is
said
can
not
help
haunting
the
scene
of
his
crime
and
if
he
should
see
me
alive
and
well
what
might
i
not
expect
from
his
astonishment
and
alarm
i
did
not
dare
go
out
but
neither
did
i
dare
remain
so
after
quaking
for
a
good
five
minutes
on
the
threshold
i
made
one
wild
dash
through
the
door
there
was
no
one
in
sight
and
i
reached
broadway
before
i
ran
across
man
or
woman
even
then
i
got
by
without
any
one
speaking
to
me
and
favored
by
providence
found
a
nook
at
the
end
of
an
where
i
remained
undiscovered
till
it
was
late
enough
in
the
morning
for
me
to
enter
a
shop
and
buy
a
hat
the
rest
of
my
movements
are
known
i
found
my
way
to
desberger
this
time
without
interruption
and
from
that
place
sought
and
found
a
situation
with
miss
althorpe
that
her
fate
was
in
any
way
connected
with
mine
or
that
the
randolph
stone
she
was
engaged
to
marry
was
the
john
randolph
from
whose
clutches
i
had
just
escaped
was
of
course
unsuspected
by
me
and
incredible
as
it
may
seem
continued
to
be
unsuspected
as
long
as
i
remained
in
the
house
there
was
reason
for
this
my
duties
were
such
as
i
could
well
attend
to
in
my
own
room
and
feeling
a
horror
of
the
world
and
everything
in
it
i
kept
my
room
as
much
as
possible
and
never
went
out
of
it
when
i
knew
that
he
was
in
the
house
the
very
thought
of
love
awakened
intolerable
emotions
in
me
and
much
as
i
admired
and
revered
miss
althorpe
i
could
not
bring
myself
to
meet
or
even
talk
of
the
man
to
whom
she
was
in
expectation
of
being
so
soon
united
there
was
another
thing
of
which
i
was
ignorant
and
that
was
the
circumstances
which
had
invested
with
so
much
interest
the
crime
of
which
i
had
been
witness
i
did
not
know
that
the
victim
had
been
recognized
or
that
an
innocent
man
had
been
arrested
for
her
murder
in
fact
i
knew
nothing
concerning
the
affair
save
what
i
had
seen
with
my
own
eyes
no
one
having
mentioned
the
murder
in
my
presence
and
i
having
religiously
avoided
the
very
sight
of
a
paper
for
fear
that
i
should
see
some
account
of
the
horrible
affair
and
so
lose
what
small
remnants
of
courage
i
still
possessed
this
apathy
concerning
a
matter
so
important
to
myself
or
rather
this
almost
frenzied
determination
to
cut
myself
loose
from
my
dreadful
past
may
seem
strange
and
unnatural
but
it
will
seem
stranger
yet
when
i
say
that
for
all
these
efforts
i
was
haunted
night
and
day
by
one
small
fact
connected
with
this
past
which
made
forgetfulness
impossible
i
had
taken
the
rings
from
the
hands
of
the
dead
woman
as
i
had
taken
away
her
clothes
and
the
possession
of
these
valuables
probably
because
they
represented
so
much
money
weighed
on
my
conscience
and
made
me
feel
like
a
thief
the
purse
which
i
found
in
a
pocket
of
the
skirt
i
had
put
on
was
a
trouble
to
me
but
the
rings
were
a
source
of
constant
terror
and
disturbance
i
hid
them
finally
in
a
ball
of
yarn
i
was
using
but
even
then
i
experienced
but
little
peace
for
they
were
not
mine
and
i
lacked
the
courage
to
avow
it
or
seek
out
the
person
to
whom
they
now
rightfully
belonged
when
therefore
in
the
intervals
of
fever
which
attacked
me
in
miss
althorpe
house
i
overheard
enough
of
a
conversation
between
her
and
miss
butterworth
to
learn
that
the
murdered
woman
had
been
a
van
burnam
and
that
her
husband
or
relatives
had
an
office
somewhere
downtown
i
was
so
seized
by
the
instinct
of
restitution
that
i
took
the
first
opportunity
that
offered
to
leave
my
bed
and
hunt
up
these
people
that
i
would
injure
them
in
any
way
by
secretly
restoring
these
jewels
i
never
dreamed
indeed
i
did
not
exercise
my
mind
at
all
on
the
subject
but
only
followed
the
instincts
of
my
delirium
and
while
to
all
appearance
i
showed
all
the
cunning
of
an
insane
person
in
the
pursuit
of
my
purpose
i
fail
to
remember
now
how
i
found
my
way
to
duane
street
or
by
what
suggestion
of
my
diseased
brain
i
was
induced
to
slip
these
rings
upon
the
hook
attached
to
van
burnam
desk
probably
the
mere
utterance
of
this
name
into
the
ears
of
the
was
enough
to
obtain
for
me
such
directions
as
i
needed
but
however
that
may
be
the
result
was
misapprehension
and
the
complications
which
followed
serious
of
the
emotion
caused
in
me
by
the
unaccountable
discovery
of
my
connection
with
this
crime
i
need
not
speak
the
love
which
i
at
one
time
felt
for
john
randolph
had
turned
to
gall
and
bitterness
but
enough
sense
of
duty
remained
in
my
bruised
and
broken
heart
to
keep
me
from
denouncing
him
to
the
police
till
by
a
sudden
stroke
of
fate
or
providence
i
saw
him
in
the
carriage
with
miss
althorpe
and
realized
that
he
was
not
only
the
man
with
whom
she
was
upon
the
point
of
allying
herself
but
that
it
was
to
preserve
his
place
in
her
regard
and
to
attain
the
lofty
position
promised
by
this
union
he
had
attempted
to
murder
me
and
had
murdered
another
woman
only
less
unfortunate
and
miserable
than
myself
it
was
the
last
and
bitterest
blow
that
could
come
from
his
hand
and
though
instinct
led
me
to
throw
myself
into
the
carriage
before
which
i
stood
and
thus
escape
a
meeting
which
i
felt
i
could
never
survive
i
was
determined
from
that
moment
not
only
to
save
miss
althorpe
from
an
alliance
with
this
villain
but
to
revenge
myself
upon
him
in
some
manner
that
this
revenge
involved
her
in
a
public
shame
from
which
her
angelic
goodness
to
me
should
have
saved
her
i
regret
now
as
deeply
as
even
she
can
wish
but
the
madness
that
was
upon
me
made
me
blind
to
every
other
consideration
than
that
of
the
boundless
hatred
i
bore
him
and
while
i
can
look
for
no
forgiveness
from
her
on
that
account
i
still
hope
the
day
will
come
when
she
will
see
that
in
spite
of
my
momentary
disregard
of
her
feelings
i
cherish
for
her
an
affection
that
nothing
can
efface
or
make
other
than
the
ruling
passion
of
my
life
xlii
with
miss
butterworth
compliments
they
tell
me
that
gryce
has
never
been
quite
the
same
man
since
the
clearing
up
of
this
mystery
that
his
confidence
in
his
own
powers
is
shaken
and
that
he
hints
more
often
than
is
agreeable
to
his
superiors
that
when
a
man
has
passed
his
year
it
is
time
for
him
to
give
up
active
connection
with
police
matters
do
not
agree
with
him
his
mistakes
if
we
may
call
them
such
were
not
those
of
failing
faculties
but
of
a
man
made
oversecure
in
his
own
conclusions
by
a
series
of
old
successes
had
he
listened
to
but
i
will
not
pursue
this
suggestion
you
will
accuse
me
of
egotism
an
imputation
i
can
not
bear
with
equanimity
and
will
not
risk
modest
depreciation
of
myself
being
one
of
the
chief
attributes
of
my
character
d
howard
van
burnam
bore
his
release
as
he
had
his
arrest
with
great
outward
composure
gryce
explanation
of
his
motives
in
perjuring
himself
before
the
coroner
was
correct
and
while
the
mass
of
people
wondered
at
that
instinct
of
pride
which
led
him
to
risk
the
imputation
of
murder
sooner
than
have
the
world
accuse
his
wife
of
an
unwomanly
action
there
were
others
who
understood
his
peculiarities
and
thought
his
conduct
quite
in
keeping
with
what
they
knew
of
his
warped
and
nature
that
he
has
been
greatly
moved
by
the
unmerited
fate
of
his
weak
but
unfortunate
wife
is
evident
from
the
sincerity
with
which
he
still
mourns
her
i
had
always
understood
that
franklin
had
never
been
told
of
the
peril
in
which
his
good
name
had
stood
for
a
few
short
hours
but
since
a
certain
confidential
conversation
which
took
place
between
us
one
evening
i
have
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
police
were
not
so
reticent
as
they
made
themselves
out
to
be
in
that
conversation
he
professed
to
thank
me
for
certain
good
offices
i
had
done
him
and
his
and
waxing
warm
in
his
gratitude
confessed
that
without
my
interference
he
would
have
found
himself
in
a
strait
of
no
ordinary
seriousness
for
said
he
there
has
been
no
of
the
feelings
i
cherished
toward
my
nor
was
there
any
mistake
made
in
thinking
that
she
uttered
some
very
desperate
threats
against
me
during
the
visit
she
paid
me
at
my
office
on
monday
but
i
never
thought
of
ridding
myself
of
her
in
any
way
i
only
thought
of
keeping
her
and
my
brother
apart
till
i
could
escape
the
country
when
therefore
he
came
into
the
office
on
tuesday
morning
for
the
keys
of
our
father
house
i
felt
such
a
dread
of
the
two
meeting
there
that
i
left
immediately
after
my
brother
for
the
place
where
she
had
told
me
she
would
await
a
final
message
from
me
i
hoped
to
move
her
by
one
final
plea
for
i
love
my
brother
sincerely
notwithstanding
the
wrong
i
once
did
him
i
was
therefore
with
her
in
another
place
at
the
very
time
i
was
thought
to
be
with
her
at
the
hotel
d
a
fact
which
greatly
hampered
me
as
you
can
see
when
i
was
requested
by
the
police
to
give
an
account
of
how
i
spent
that
day
when
i
left
her
it
was
to
seek
my
brother
she
had
told
me
of
her
deliberate
intention
of
spending
the
night
in
the
gramercy
park
house
and
as
i
saw
no
way
of
her
doing
this
without
my
connivance
i
started
in
search
of
him
meaning
to
stick
to
him
when
i
found
him
and
keep
him
away
from
her
till
that
night
was
over
i
was
not
successful
in
my
undertaking
he
was
locked
in
his
rooms
it
seems
packing
up
his
effects
for
flight
we
always
had
the
same
instincts
even
when
boys
and
receiving
no
answer
to
my
knock
i
hastened
away
to
gramercy
park
to
keep
a
watch
over
the
house
against
my
brother
coming
there
this
was
early
in
the
evening
and
for
hours
afterwards
i
wandered
like
a
restless
spirit
in
and
out
of
those
streets
meeting
no
one
i
knew
not
even
my
brother
though
he
was
wandering
about
in
very
much
the
same
manner
and
with
very
much
the
same
apprehensions
the
duplicity
of
the
woman
became
very
evident
to
me
the
next
morning
in
my
last
interview
with
her
she
had
shown
no
relenting
in
her
purpose
towards
me
but
when
i
entered
my
office
after
this
restless
night
in
the
streets
i
found
lying
on
my
desk
her
little
which
had
been
sent
down
from
parker
in
it
was
just
as
you
divined
miss
butterworth
i
had
hardly
got
over
the
shock
of
this
most
unexpected
good
fortune
when
the
news
came
that
a
woman
had
been
found
dead
in
my
father
house
what
was
i
to
think
that
it
was
she
of
course
and
that
my
brother
had
been
the
man
to
let
her
in
there
miss
butterworth
this
is
how
he
ended
i
make
no
demands
upon
you
as
i
have
made
no
demands
upon
the
police
to
keep
the
secret
contained
in
that
letter
from
my
brother
or
rather
it
is
too
late
now
to
keep
it
for
i
have
told
him
all
there
was
to
tell
myself
and
he
has
seen
fit
to
overlook
my
fault
and
to
regard
me
with
even
more
affection
than
he
did
before
this
dreadful
tragedy
came
to
harrow
up
our
lives
do
you
wonder
i
like
franklin
van
burnam
the
misses
van
burnam
call
upon
me
regularly
and
when
they
say
old
thing
now
they
mean
it
of
miss
althorpe
i
can
not
trust
myself
to
speak
she
was
and
is
the
finest
woman
i
know
and
when
the
great
shadow
now
hanging
over
her
has
lost
some
of
its
impenetrability
she
will
be
a
useful
one
again
or
i
do
not
rightly
read
the
patient
smile
which
makes
her
face
so
beautiful
in
its
sadness
olive
randolph
has
at
my
request
taken
up
her
abode
in
my
house
the
charm
which
she
seems
to
have
exerted
over
others
she
has
exerted
over
me
and
i
doubt
if
i
shall
ever
wish
to
part
with
her
again
in
return
she
gives
me
an
affection
which
i
am
now
getting
old
enough
to
appreciate
her
feeling
for
me
and
her
gratitude
to
miss
althorpe
are
the
only
treasures
left
her
out
of
the
wreck
of
her
life
and
it
shall
be
my
business
to
make
them
lasting
ones
the
fate
of
randolph
stone
is
too
well
known
for
me
to
enlarge
upon
it
but
before
i
bid
farewell
to
his
name
i
must
say
that
after
that
curt
confession
of
his
yes
i
did
it
in
the
way
and
for
the
motive
she
alleged
i
have
often
tried
to
imagine
the
contradictory
feelings
with
which
he
must
have
listened
to
the
facts
as
they
came
out
at
the
inquest
and
convinced
as
he
had
every
reason
to
be
that
the
victim
was
his
wife
heard
his
friend
howard
not
only
accept
her
for
his
but
insist
that
he
was
the
man
who
accompanied
her
to
that
house
of
death
he
has
never
lifted
the
veil
from
those
hours
and
he
never
will
but
i
would
give
much
of
the
peace
of
mind
which
has
lately
come
to
me
to
know
what
his
sensations
were
not
only
at
that
time
but
when
on
the
evening
after
the
murder
he
opened
the
papers
and
read
that
the
woman
whom
he
had
left
for
dead
with
her
brain
pierced
by
a
had
been
found
on
that
same
floor
crushed
under
a
fallen
cabinet
and
what
explanation
he
was
ever
able
to
make
to
himself
for
a
fact
so
inexplicable
footnotes
footnote
d
my
attention
has
been
called
to
the
fact
that
i
have
not
confessed
whether
it
was
owing
to
a
mistake
made
by
gryce
or
myself
that
franklin
van
burnam
was
identified
as
the
man
who
had
entered
the
adjoining
house
on
the
night
of
the
murder
well
the
truth
is
neither
of
us
was
to
blame
for
that
the
man
i
identified
it
was
while
watching
the
guests
who
attended
van
burnam
funeral
you
remember
was
really
stone
but
owing
to
the
fact
that
this
latter
gentleman
had
lingered
in
the
vestibule
till
he
was
joined
by
franklin
and
that
they
had
finally
entered
together
some
confusion
was
created
in
the
mind
of
the
man
on
duty
in
the
hall
so
that
when
gryce
asked
him
who
it
was
that
came
in
immediately
after
the
four
who
arrived
together
he
answered
franklin
van
burnam
being
anxious
to
win
his
applause
and
considering
that
person
much
more
likely
to
merit
the
detective
attention
than
a
mere
friend
of
the
family
like
stone
in
punishment
for
this
momentary
display
of
egotism
he
has
been
discharged
from
the
force
i
a
b
the
end
