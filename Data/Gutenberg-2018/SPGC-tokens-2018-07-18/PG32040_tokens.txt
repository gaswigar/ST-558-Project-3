illustrated

said
he
was
immortal
but
nothing
could
kill
him
still
if
the
earth
was
to
live
as
a
free
world
he
had
to
come
right
in
gentlemen
the
ambassador
waved
them
into
the
very
special
suite
the
state
department
had
given
him
please
be
seated
colonel
cercy
accepted
a
chair
trying
to
size
up
the
individual
who
had
all
washington
chewing
its
fingernails
the
ambassador
hardly
looked
like
a
menace
he
was
of
medium
height
and
slight
build
dressed
in
a
conservative
brown
tweed
suit
that
the
state
department
had
given
him
his
face
was
intelligent
finely
molded
and
aloof
human
as
a
cercy
thought
studying
the
alien
with
bleak
impersonal
eyes
how
may
i
serve
you
the
ambassador
asked
smiling
the
president
has
put
me
in
charge
of
your
case
cercy
said
studied
professor
darrig
reports
he
nodded
at
the
scientist
beside
him
but
i
like
to
hear
the
whole
thing
for
myself
of
course
the
alien
said
lighting
a
cigarette
he
seemed
genuinely
pleased
to
be
asked
which
was
interesting
cercy
thought
in
the
week
since
he
had
landed
every
important
scientist
in
the
country
had
been
at
him
in
a
pinch
they
call
the
cercy
reminded
himself
he
settled
back
in
his
chair
both
hands
jammed
carelessly
in
his
pockets
his
right
hand
was
resting
on
the
butt
of
a
the
safety
off
i
have
come
the
alien
said
as
an
representing
an
empire
that
stretches
across
the
galaxy
i
wish
to
extend
the
welcome
of
my
people
and
to
invite
you
to
join
our
organization
i
see
cercy
replied
some
of
the
scientists
got
the
impression
that
participation
was
compulsory
you
will
join
the
ambassador
said
blowing
smoke
through
his
nostrils
cercy
could
see
darrig
stiffen
in
his
chair
and
bite
his
lip
cercy
moved
the
automatic
to
a
position
where
he
could
draw
it
easily
how
did
you
find
us
he
asked
we
are
each
assigned
an
unexplored
section
of
space
the
alien
said
we
examine
each
in
that
region
for
planets
and
each
planet
for
intelligent
life
intelligent
life
is
rare
in
the
galaxy
you
know
cercy
nodded
although
he
had
been
aware
of
the
fact
when
we
find
such
a
planet
we
land
as
i
did
and
prepare
the
inhabitants
for
their
part
in
our
organization
how
will
your
people
know
that
you
have
found
intelligent
life
cercy
asked
there
is
a
sending
mechanism
that
is
part
of
our
structure
the
ambassador
answered
it
is
triggered
when
we
reach
an
inhabited
planet
this
signal
is
beamed
continually
into
space
to
an
effective
range
of
several
thousand
crews
are
continually
sweeping
through
the
limits
of
the
reception
area
of
each
ambassador
listening
for
such
messages
detecting
one
a
colonizing
team
follows
it
to
the
planet
he
tapped
his
cigarette
delicately
on
the
edge
of
an
ash
tray
this
method
has
definite
advantages
over
sending
combined
colonization
and
exploration
teams
obviously
it
avoids
the
necessity
of
equipping
large
forces
for
what
may
be
decades
of
searching
sure
cercy
face
was
expressionless
would
you
tell
me
more
about
this
message
there
is
much
more
you
need
know
the
beam
is
not
detectable
by
your
methods
and
therefore
can
not
be
jammed
the
message
continues
as
long
as
i
am
alive
darrig
drew
in
his
breath
sharply
glancing
at
cercy
if
you
stopped
broadcasting
cercy
said
casually
our
planet
would
never
be
found
not
until
this
section
of
space
was
resurveyed
the
diplomat
agreed
very
well
as
a
duly
appointed
representative
of
the
president
of
the
united
states
i
ask
you
to
stop
transmitting
we
do
choose
to
become
part
of
your
empire
i
sorry
the
ambassador
said
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
easily
cercy
wondered
how
many
times
he
had
played
this
scene
on
how
many
other
planets
there
really
nothing
i
can
do
he
stood
up
then
you
wo
stop
i
ca
i
have
no
control
over
the
sending
once
it
activated
the
diplomat
turned
and
walked
to
the
window
however
i
have
prepared
a
philosophy
for
you
it
is
my
duty
as
your
ambassador
to
ease
the
shock
of
transition
as
much
as
possible
this
philosophy
will
make
it
instantly
apparent
that
as
the
ambassador
reached
the
window
cercy
gun
was
out
of
his
pocket
and
roaring
he
squeezed
six
rounds
in
almost
a
single
explosion
aiming
at
the
ambassador
head
and
back
then
an
uncontrollable
shudder
ran
through
him
the
ambassador
was
no
longer
there
cercy
and
darrig
stared
at
each
other
darrig
muttered
something
about
ghosts
then
just
as
suddenly
the
ambassador
was
back
you
did
think
he
said
that
it
would
be
as
easy
as
all
that
did
you
we
ambassadors
have
necessarily
a
certain
diplomatic
immunity
he
fingered
one
of
the
bullet
holes
in
the
wall
in
case
you
do
understand
let
me
put
it
this
way
it
is
not
in
your
power
to
kill
me
you
could
even
understand
the
nature
of
my
defense
he
looked
at
them
and
in
that
moment
cercy
felt
the
complete
alienness
good
day
gentlemen
he
said
darrig
and
cercy
walked
silently
back
to
the
control
room
neither
had
really
expected
that
the
ambassador
would
be
killed
so
easily
but
it
had
still
been
a
shock
when
the
slugs
had
failed
i
suppose
you
saw
it
all
malley
cercy
asked
when
he
reached
the
control
room
the
thin
balding
psychiatrist
nodded
sadly
got
it
on
film
too
i
wonder
what
his
philosophy
is
darrig
mused
half
to
himself
it
was
illogical
to
expect
it
would
work
no
race
would
send
an
ambassador
with
a
message
like
that
and
expect
him
to
live
through
it
unless
unless
what
unless
he
had
a
pretty
effective
defense
the
psychiatrist
finished
unhappily
cercy
walked
across
the
room
and
looked
at
the
video
panel
the
ambassador
suite
was
very
special
it
had
been
hurriedly
constructed
two
days
after
he
had
landed
and
delivered
his
message
the
suite
was
steel
and
lead
lined
filled
with
video
and
movie
cameras
recorders
and
a
variety
of
other
things
it
was
the
last
word
in
elaborate
death
cells
in
the
screen
cercy
could
see
the
ambassador
sitting
at
a
table
he
was
typing
on
a
little
portable
the
government
had
given
him
hey
harrison
cercy
called
might
as
well
go
ahead
with
plan
two
harrison
came
out
of
a
side
room
where
he
had
been
examining
the
circuits
leading
to
the
ambassador
suite
methodically
he
checked
his
pressure
gauges
set
the
controls
and
looked
at
cercy
now
he
asked
now
cercy
watched
the
screen
the
ambassador
was
still
typing
suddenly
as
harrison
sent
home
the
switch
the
room
was
engulfed
in
flames
fire
blasted
out
of
concealed
holes
in
the
walls
poured
from
the
ceiling
and
floor
in
a
moment
the
room
was
like
the
inside
of
a
blast
furnace
cercy
let
it
burn
for
two
minutes
then
motioned
harrison
to
cut
the
switch
they
stared
at
the
roasted
room
they
were
looking
hopefully
for
a
charred
corpse
but
the
ambassador
reappeared
beside
his
desk
looking
ruefully
at
the
charred
typewriter
he
was
completely
unsinged
could
you
get
me
another
typewriter
he
asked
looking
directly
at
one
of
the
hidden
projectors
i
setting
down
a
philosophy
for
you
ungrateful
wretches
he
seated
himself
in
the
wreckage
of
an
armchair
in
a
moment
he
was
apparently
asleep
all
right
everyone
grab
a
seat
cercy
said
time
for
a
council
of
war
malley
straddled
a
chair
backward
harrison
lighted
a
pipe
as
he
sat
down
slowly
puffing
it
into
life
now
then
cercy
said
the
government
has
dropped
this
squarely
in
our
laps
we
have
to
kill
the
ambassador
obviously
i
been
put
in
charge
cercy
grinned
with
regret
probably
because
no
one
higher
up
wants
the
responsibility
of
failure
and
i
selected
you
three
as
my
staff
we
can
have
anything
we
want
any
assistance
or
advice
we
need
all
right
any
ideas
how
about
plan
three
harrison
asked
we
get
to
that
cercy
said
but
i
do
believe
it
going
to
work
i
do
either
darrig
agreed
we
do
even
know
the
nature
of
his
defense
that
the
first
order
of
business
malley
take
all
our
data
so
far
and
get
someone
to
feed
it
into
the
derichman
analyzer
you
know
the
stuff
we
want
what
properties
has
x
if
x
can
do
thus
and
thus
right
malley
said
he
left
muttering
something
about
the
ascendancy
of
the
physical
sciences
harrison
cercy
asked
is
plan
three
set
up
sure
give
it
a
try
while
harrison
was
making
his
last
adjustments
cercy
watched
darrig
the
plump
little
physicist
was
staring
thoughtfully
into
space
muttering
to
himself
cercy
hoped
he
would
come
up
with
something
he
was
expecting
great
things
of
darrig
knowing
the
impossibility
of
working
with
great
numbers
of
people
cercy
had
picked
his
staff
with
care
quality
was
what
he
wanted
with
that
in
mind
he
had
chosen
harrison
first
the
stocky
engineer
had
a
reputation
for
being
able
to
build
anything
given
half
an
idea
of
how
it
worked
cercy
had
selected
malley
the
psychiatrist
because
he
was
sure
that
killing
the
ambassador
was
going
to
be
a
purely
physical
problem
darrig
was
a
mathematical
physicist
but
his
restless
curious
mind
had
come
up
with
some
interesting
theories
in
other
fields
he
was
the
only
one
of
the
four
who
was
really
interested
in
the
ambassador
as
an
intellectual
problem
he
like
metal
old
man
darrig
said
finally
what
that
have
you
ever
heard
the
story
of
metal
old
man
well
he
was
a
monster
covered
with
black
metal
armor
he
was
met
by
an
apache
culture
hero
after
many
attempts
finally
killed
metal
old
man
how
did
he
do
it
shot
him
in
the
armpit
he
did
have
any
armor
there
fine
cercy
grinned
ask
our
ambassador
to
raise
his
arm
all
set
harrison
called
fine
go
in
the
ambassador
room
an
invisible
spray
of
gamma
rays
silently
began
to
flood
the
room
with
deadly
radiation
but
there
was
no
ambassador
to
receive
them
that
enough
cercy
said
after
a
while
that
would
kill
a
herd
of
elephants
but
the
ambassador
stayed
invisible
for
five
hours
until
some
of
the
radioactivity
had
abated
then
he
appeared
again
i
still
waiting
for
that
typewriter
he
said
here
the
analyzer
report
malley
handed
cercy
a
sheaf
of
papers
this
is
the
final
formulation
boiled
down
cercy
read
it
aloud
the
simplest
defense
against
any
and
all
weapons
is
to
each
particular
weapon
great
harrison
said
what
does
it
mean
it
means
darrig
explained
that
when
we
attack
the
ambassador
with
fire
he
turns
into
fire
shoot
at
him
and
he
turns
into
a
bullet
until
the
menace
is
gone
and
then
he
changes
back
again
he
took
the
papers
out
of
cercy
hand
and
riffled
through
them
hmm
wonder
if
there
any
historical
parallel
do
suppose
so
he
raised
his
head
although
this
is
conclusive
it
seems
logical
enough
any
other
defense
would
involve
recognition
of
the
weapon
first
then
an
appraisal
then
a
countermove
predicated
on
the
potentialities
of
the
weapon
the
ambassador
defense
would
be
a
lot
faster
and
safer
he
would
have
to
recognize
the
weapon
i
suppose
his
body
simply
in
some
way
with
the
menace
at
hand
did
the
analyzer
say
there
was
any
way
of
breaking
this
defense
cercy
asked
the
analyzer
stated
definitely
that
there
was
no
way
if
the
premise
were
true
malley
answered
gloomily
we
can
discard
that
judgment
darrig
said
the
machine
is
limited
but
we
still
have
got
any
way
of
stopping
him
malley
pointed
out
and
he
still
broadcasting
that
beam
cercy
thought
for
a
moment
call
in
every
expert
you
can
find
going
to
throw
the
book
at
the
ambassador
i
know
he
said
looking
at
darrig
dubious
expression
but
we
have
to
try
during
the
next
few
days
every
combination
and
permutation
of
death
was
thrown
at
the
ambassador
he
was
showered
with
weapons
ranging
from
axes
to
modern
rifles
peppered
with
hand
grenades
drowned
in
acid
suffocated
in
poison
gas
he
kept
shrugging
his
shoulders
philosophically
and
continued
to
work
on
the
new
typewriter
they
had
given
him
bacteria
was
piped
in
first
the
known
germ
diseases
then
mutated
species
the
diplomat
did
even
sneeze
he
was
showered
with
electricity
radiation
wooden
weapons
iron
weapons
copper
weapons
brass
weapons
uranium
weapons
anything
and
everything
just
to
cover
all
possibilities
he
did
suffer
a
scratch
but
his
room
looked
as
though
a
brawl
had
been
going
on
in
it
continually
for
fifty
years
malley
was
working
on
an
idea
of
his
own
as
was
darrig
the
physicist
interrupted
himself
long
enough
to
remind
cercy
of
the
baldur
myth
baldur
had
been
showered
with
every
kind
of
weapon
and
remained
unscathed
because
everything
on
earth
had
promised
to
love
him
everything
except
the
mistletoe
when
a
little
twig
of
it
was
shot
at
him
he
died
cercy
turned
away
impatiently
but
had
an
order
of
mistletoe
sent
up
just
in
case
it
was
at
least
no
less
effective
than
the
explosive
shells
or
the
bow
and
arrow
it
did
nothing
except
lend
an
oddly
festive
air
to
the
battered
room
after
a
week
of
this
they
moved
the
unprotesting
ambassador
into
a
newer
bigger
stronger
death
cell
they
were
unable
to
venture
into
his
old
one
because
of
the
radioactivity
and
the
ambassador
went
back
to
work
at
his
typewriter
all
his
previous
attempts
had
been
burned
torn
or
eaten
away
let
go
talk
to
him
darrig
suggested
after
another
day
had
passed
cercy
agreed
for
the
moment
they
were
out
of
ideas
come
right
in
gentlemen
the
ambassador
said
so
cheerfully
that
cercy
felt
sick
i
sorry
i
ca
offer
you
anything
through
an
oversight
i
have
been
given
any
food
or
water
for
about
ten
days
not
that
it
matters
of
course
glad
to
hear
it
cercy
said
the
ambassador
hardly
looked
as
if
he
had
been
facing
all
the
violence
earth
had
to
offer
on
the
contrary
cercy
and
his
men
looked
as
though
they
had
been
under
bombardment
you
got
quite
a
defense
there
malley
said
conversationally
glad
you
like
it
would
you
mind
telling
us
how
it
works
darrig
asked
innocently
do
you
know
we
think
so
you
become
what
is
attacking
you
is
that
right
certainly
the
ambassador
said
you
see
i
have
no
secrets
from
you
is
there
anything
we
can
give
you
cercy
asked
to
get
you
to
turn
off
that
signal
a
bribe
sure
cercy
said
anything
you
nothing
the
ambassador
replied
look
be
reasonable
harrison
said
you
do
want
to
cause
a
war
do
you
earth
is
united
now
we
arming
with
what
atom
bombs
malley
answered
him
hydrogen
bombs
we
drop
one
on
me
the
ambassador
said
it
would
kill
me
what
makes
you
think
it
will
have
any
effect
on
my
people
the
four
men
were
silent
somehow
they
had
thought
of
that
a
people
ability
to
make
war
the
ambassador
stated
is
a
measure
of
the
status
of
their
civilization
stage
one
is
the
use
of
simple
physical
extensions
stage
two
is
control
at
the
molecular
level
you
are
on
the
threshold
of
stage
three
although
still
far
from
mastery
of
atomic
and
subatomic
forces
he
smiled
ingratiatingly
my
people
are
reaching
the
limits
of
stage
five
what
would
that
be
darrig
asked
you
find
out
the
ambassador
said
but
perhaps
you
wondered
if
my
powers
are
typical
i
do
mind
telling
you
that
they
not
in
order
for
me
to
do
my
job
and
nothing
more
i
have
certain
restrictions
making
me
capable
only
of
passive
action
why
darrig
asked
for
obvious
reasons
if
i
were
to
take
positive
action
in
a
moment
of
anger
i
might
destroy
your
entire
planet
do
you
expect
us
to
believe
that
cercy
asked
why
not
is
it
so
hard
to
understand
ca
you
believe
that
there
are
forces
you
know
nothing
about
and
there
is
another
reason
for
my
passiveness
certainly
by
this
time
you
deduced
it
to
break
our
spirit
i
suppose
cercy
said
exactly
my
telling
you
wo
make
any
difference
either
the
pattern
is
always
the
same
an
ambassador
lands
and
delivers
his
message
to
a
wild
young
race
like
yours
there
is
frenzied
resistance
against
him
spasmodic
attempts
to
kill
him
after
all
these
fail
the
people
are
usually
quite
crestfallen
when
the
colonization
team
arrives
their
indoctrination
goes
along
just
that
much
faster
he
paused
then
said
most
planets
are
more
interested
in
the
philosophy
i
have
to
offer
i
assure
you
it
will
make
the
transition
far
easier
he
held
out
a
sheaf
of
typewritten
pages
wo
you
at
least
look
through
it
darrig
accepted
the
papers
and
put
them
in
his
pocket
when
i
get
time
i
suggest
you
give
it
a
try
the
ambassador
said
you
must
be
near
the
crisis
point
now
why
not
give
it
up
not
yet
cercy
replied
tonelessly
do
forget
to
read
the
philosophy
the
ambassador
urged
them
the
men
hurried
from
the
room
now
look
malley
said
once
they
were
back
in
the
control
room
there
are
a
few
things
we
have
tried
how
about
utilizing
psychology
anything
you
like
cercy
agreed
including
black
magic
what
did
you
have
in
mind
the
way
i
see
it
malley
answered
the
ambassador
is
geared
to
respond
instantaneously
to
any
threat
he
must
have
an
defensive
reflex
i
suggest
first
that
we
try
something
that
wo
trigger
that
reflex
like
what
cercy
asked
hypnotism
perhaps
we
can
find
out
something
sure
cercy
said
try
it
try
anything
cercy
malley
and
darrig
gathered
around
the
video
screen
as
an
infinitesimal
amount
of
a
light
hypnotic
gas
was
admitted
into
the
ambassador
room
at
the
same
time
a
bolt
of
electricity
lashed
into
the
chair
where
the
ambassador
was
sitting
that
was
to
distract
him
malley
explained
the
ambassador
vanished
before
the
electricity
struck
him
and
then
appeared
again
curled
up
in
his
armchair
that
enough
malley
whispered
and
shut
the
valve
they
watched
after
a
while
the
ambassador
put
down
his
book
and
stared
into
the
distance
how
strange
he
said
alfern
dead
good
friend
just
a
freak
accident
he
ran
into
it
out
there
did
have
a
chance
but
it
does
happen
often
he
thinking
out
loud
malley
whispered
although
there
was
no
possibility
of
the
ambassador
hearing
them
vocalizing
his
thoughts
his
friend
must
have
been
on
his
mind
for
some
time
of
course
the
ambassador
went
on
alfern
had
to
die
sometime
no
immortality
yet
but
that
way
no
defense
out
there
in
space
they
just
pop
up
always
there
underneath
just
waiting
for
a
chance
to
boil
out
his
body
is
reacting
to
the
hypnotic
as
a
menace
yet
cercy
whispered
well
the
ambassador
told
himself
the
regularizing
principle
has
been
doing
pretty
well
keeping
it
all
down
smoothing
out
the
inconsistencies
suddenly
he
leaped
to
his
feet
his
face
pale
for
a
moment
as
he
obviously
tried
to
remember
what
he
had
said
then
he
laughed
clever
that
the
first
time
that
particular
trick
has
been
played
on
me
and
the
last
time
but
gentlemen
it
did
do
you
any
good
i
do
know
myself
how
to
go
about
killing
me
he
laughed
at
the
blank
walls
besides
he
continued
the
colonizing
team
must
have
the
direction
now
they
find
you
with
or
without
me
he
sat
down
again
smiling
that
does
it
darrig
cried
he
not
invulnerable
something
killed
his
friend
alfern
something
out
in
space
cercy
reminded
him
i
wonder
what
it
was
let
me
see
darrig
reflected
aloud
the
regularizing
principle
that
must
be
a
natural
law
we
knew
nothing
about
and
underneath
what
would
be
underneath
he
said
the
colonization
team
would
find
us
anyhow
malley
reminded
them
first
things
first
cercy
said
he
might
have
been
bluffing
us
no
i
do
suppose
so
we
still
have
to
get
the
ambassador
out
of
the
way
i
think
i
know
what
is
underneath
darrig
exclaimed
this
is
wonderful
a
new
cosmology
perhaps
what
is
it
cercy
asked
anything
we
can
use
i
think
so
but
let
me
work
it
out
i
think
i
go
back
to
my
hotel
i
have
some
books
there
i
want
to
check
and
i
do
want
to
be
disturbed
for
a
few
hours
all
right
cercy
agreed
but
what
illustration
no
no
i
could
be
wrong
darrig
said
let
me
work
it
out
he
hurried
from
the
room
what
do
you
think
he
driving
at
malley
asked
beats
me
cercy
shrugged
come
on
let
try
some
more
of
that
psychological
stuff
first
they
filled
the
ambassador
room
with
several
feet
of
water
not
enough
to
drown
him
just
enough
to
make
him
good
and
uncomfortable
to
this
they
added
the
lights
for
eight
hours
lights
flashed
in
the
ambassador
room
bright
lights
to
pry
under
his
eyelids
dull
clashing
ones
to
disturb
him
sound
came
next
screeches
and
screams
and
shrill
grating
noises
the
sound
of
a
man
fingernails
being
dragged
across
slate
amplified
a
thousand
times
and
strange
sucking
noises
and
shouts
and
whispers
then
the
smells
then
everything
else
they
could
think
of
that
could
drive
a
man
insane
the
ambassador
slept
peacefully
through
it
all
now
look
cercy
said
the
following
day
let
start
using
our
damned
heads
his
voice
was
hoarse
and
rough
although
the
psychological
torture
had
bothered
the
ambassador
it
seemed
to
have
backfired
on
cercy
and
his
men
where
in
hell
is
darrig
still
working
on
that
idea
of
his
malley
said
rubbing
his
stubbled
chin
says
he
just
about
got
it
we
work
on
the
assumption
that
he
ca
produce
cercy
said
start
thinking
for
example
if
the
ambassador
can
turn
into
anything
what
is
there
he
ca
turn
into
good
question
harrison
grunted
it
the
payoff
question
cercy
said
no
use
throwing
a
spear
at
a
man
who
can
turn
into
one
how
about
this
malley
asked
taking
it
for
granted
he
can
turn
into
anything
how
about
putting
him
in
a
situation
where
he
be
attacked
even
he
alters
i
listening
cercy
said
say
he
in
danger
he
turns
into
the
thing
threatening
him
what
if
were
itself
being
threatened
and
in
turn
was
in
the
act
of
threatening
something
else
what
would
he
do
then
how
are
you
going
to
put
that
into
action
cercy
asked
like
this
malley
picked
up
the
telephone
hello
give
me
the
washington
zoo
this
is
urgent
the
ambassador
turned
as
the
door
opened
an
unwilling
angry
hungry
tiger
was
propelled
in
the
door
slammed
shut
the
tiger
looked
at
the
ambassador
the
ambassador
looked
at
the
tiger
most
ingenious
the
ambassador
said
at
the
sound
of
his
voice
the
tiger
came
unglued
he
sprang
like
a
steel
spring
uncoiling
landing
on
the
floor
where
the
ambassador
had
been
the
door
opened
again
another
tiger
was
pushed
in
he
snarled
angrily
and
leaped
at
the
first
they
smashed
together
in
midair
the
ambassador
appeared
a
few
feet
off
watching
he
moved
back
when
a
lion
entered
the
door
head
up
and
alert
the
lion
sprang
at
him
almost
going
over
on
his
head
when
he
struck
nothing
not
finding
any
human
the
lion
leaped
on
one
of
the
tigers
the
ambassador
reappeared
in
his
chair
where
he
sat
smoking
and
watching
the
beasts
kill
each
other
in
ten
minutes
the
room
looked
like
an
abattoir
but
by
then
the
ambassador
had
tired
of
the
spectacle
and
was
reclining
on
his
bed
reading
i
give
up
malley
said
that
was
my
last
bright
idea
cercy
stared
at
the
floor
not
answering
harrison
was
seated
in
the
corner
getting
quietly
drunk
the
telephone
rang
yeah
cercy
said
i
got
it
darrig
voice
shouted
over
the
line
i
really
think
this
is
it
look
i
taking
a
cab
right
down
tell
harrison
to
find
some
helpers
what
is
it
cercy
asked
the
chaos
underneath
darrig
replied
and
hung
up
they
paced
the
floor
waiting
for
him
to
show
up
half
an
hour
passed
then
an
hour
finally
three
hours
after
he
had
called
darrig
strolled
in
hello
he
said
casually
hello
hell
cercy
growled
what
kept
you
on
the
way
over
darrig
said
i
read
the
ambassador
philosophy
it
quite
a
work
is
that
what
took
you
so
long
yes
i
had
the
driver
take
me
around
the
park
a
few
times
while
i
was
reading
it
skip
it
how
about
i
ca
skip
it
darrig
said
in
a
strange
tight
voice
i
afraid
we
were
wrong
about
the
aliens
i
mean
it
perfectly
right
and
proper
that
they
should
rule
us
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
wish
hurry
up
and
get
here
but
darrig
did
look
certain
his
voice
shook
and
perspiration
poured
from
his
face
he
twisted
his
hands
together
as
though
in
agony
it
hard
to
explain
he
said
everything
became
clear
as
soon
as
i
started
reading
it
i
saw
how
stupid
we
were
trying
to
be
independent
in
this
interdependent
universe
i
saw
oh
look
cercy
let
stop
all
this
foolishness
and
accept
the
ambassador
as
our
friend
calm
down
cercy
shouted
at
the
perfectly
calm
physicist
you
know
what
you
saying
it
strange
darrig
said
i
know
how
i
felt
i
just
do
feel
that
way
any
more
i
think
anyhow
i
know
trouble
you
read
the
philosophy
you
see
what
i
mean
once
you
read
it
he
handed
cercy
the
pile
of
papers
cercy
promptly
ignited
them
with
his
cigarette
lighter
it
does
matter
darrig
said
i
got
it
memorized
just
listen
axiom
one
all
peoples
cercy
hit
him
a
short
clean
blow
and
darrig
slumped
to
the
floor
those
words
must
be
semantically
keyed
malley
said
designed
to
set
off
certain
reactions
in
us
i
suppose
all
the
ambassador
does
is
alter
the
philosophy
to
suit
the
peoples
dealing
with
look
malley
cercy
said
this
is
your
job
now
darrig
knows
or
thought
he
knew
the
answer
you
have
to
get
that
out
of
him
that
wo
be
easy
malley
said
he
feel
that
he
was
betraying
everything
he
believes
in
if
he
were
to
tell
us
i
do
care
how
you
get
it
cercy
said
just
get
it
even
if
it
kills
him
malley
asked
even
if
it
kills
you
help
me
get
him
to
my
lab
malley
said
that
night
cercy
and
harrison
kept
watch
on
the
ambassador
from
the
control
room
cercy
found
his
thoughts
were
racing
in
circles
what
had
killed
alfern
in
space
could
it
be
duplicated
on
earth
what
was
the
regularizing
principle
what
was
the
chaos
underneath
in
hell
am
i
doing
here
he
asked
himself
but
he
start
that
sort
of
thing
what
do
you
figure
the
ambassador
is
he
asked
harrison
is
he
a
man
looks
like
one
harrison
said
drowsily
but
he
does
act
like
one
i
wonder
if
this
is
his
true
shape
harrison
shook
his
head
and
lighted
his
pipe
what
is
there
of
him
cercy
asked
he
looks
like
a
man
but
he
can
change
into
anything
else
you
ca
attack
him
he
adapts
he
like
water
taking
the
shape
of
any
vessel
he
poured
into
you
can
boil
water
harrison
yawned
sure
water
has
any
shape
has
it
or
has
it
what
basic
with
an
effort
harrison
tried
to
focus
on
cercy
words
molecular
pattern
the
matrix
matrix
cercy
repeated
yawning
himself
pattern
must
be
something
like
that
a
pattern
is
abstract
is
it
sure
a
pattern
can
be
impressed
on
anything
what
did
i
say
let
see
cercy
said
pattern
matrix
everything
about
the
ambassador
is
capable
of
change
there
must
be
some
unifying
force
that
retains
his
personality
something
that
change
no
matter
what
contortions
he
goes
through
like
a
piece
of
string
harrison
murmured
with
his
eyes
closed
sure
tie
it
in
knots
weave
a
rope
out
of
it
wind
it
around
your
finger
it
still
string
yeah
but
how
do
you
attack
a
pattern
cercy
asked
and
why
could
he
get
some
sleep
to
hell
with
the
ambassador
and
his
hordes
of
colonists
he
was
going
to
close
his
eyes
for
a
moment
wake
up
colonel
cercy
pried
his
eyes
open
and
looked
up
at
malley
besides
him
harrison
was
snoring
deeply
did
you
get
anything
not
a
thing
malley
confessed
the
philosophy
must
had
quite
an
effect
on
him
but
it
did
work
all
the
way
darrig
knew
that
he
to
kill
the
ambassador
and
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
although
he
felt
differently
now
he
still
had
the
feeling
that
he
was
betraying
us
on
the
one
hand
he
could
hurt
the
ambassador
on
the
other
he
would
hurt
us
wo
he
tell
anything
i
afraid
it
not
that
simple
malley
said
you
know
if
you
have
an
insurmountable
obstacle
that
be
surmounted
and
also
i
think
the
philosophy
had
an
injurious
effect
on
his
mind
what
are
you
trying
to
say
cercy
got
to
his
feet
i
sorry
malley
apologized
there
was
a
damned
thing
i
could
do
darrig
fought
the
whole
thing
out
in
his
mind
and
when
he
could
fight
any
longer
he
retreated
i
afraid
he
hopelessly
insane
let
see
him
they
walked
down
the
corridor
to
malley
laboratory
darrig
was
relaxed
on
a
couch
his
eyes
glazed
and
staring
is
there
any
way
of
curing
him
cercy
asked
shock
therapy
maybe
malley
was
dubious
it
take
a
long
time
and
he
probably
block
out
everything
that
had
to
do
with
producing
this
cercy
turned
away
feeling
sick
even
if
darrig
could
be
cured
it
would
be
too
late
the
aliens
must
have
picked
up
the
message
by
now
and
were
undoubtedly
heading
for
earth
what
this
cercy
asked
picking
up
a
piece
of
paper
that
lay
by
darrig
hand
oh
he
was
doodling
malley
said
is
there
anything
written
on
it
cercy
read
aloud
further
consideration
i
can
see
that
chaos
and
the
gorgon
medusa
are
closely
related
what
does
that
mean
malley
asked
i
do
know
cercy
puzzled
he
was
always
interested
in
folklore
sounds
schizophrenic
the
psychiatrist
said
cercy
read
it
again
further
consideration
i
can
see
that
chaos
and
the
gorgon
medusa
are
closely
related
he
stared
at
it
is
it
possible
he
asked
malley
that
he
was
trying
to
give
us
a
clue
trying
to
trick
himself
into
giving
and
not
giving
at
the
same
time
it
possible
malley
agreed
an
unsuccessful
compromise
but
what
could
it
mean
chaos
cercy
remembered
darrig
mentioning
that
word
in
his
telephone
call
that
was
the
original
state
of
the
universe
in
greek
myth
was
it
the
formlessness
out
of
which
everything
came
something
like
that
malley
said
and
medusa
was
one
of
those
three
sisters
with
the
horrible
faces
cercy
stood
for
a
moment
staring
at
the
paper
chaos
medusa
and
the
organizing
principle
of
course
i
think
he
turned
and
ran
from
the
room
malley
looked
at
him
then
loaded
a
hypodermic
and
followed
in
the
control
room
cercy
shouted
harrison
into
consciousness
listen
he
said
i
want
you
to
build
something
quick
do
you
hear
me
sure
harrison
blinked
and
sat
up
what
the
rush
i
know
what
darrig
wanted
to
tell
us
cercy
said
come
on
tell
you
what
i
want
and
malley
put
down
that
hypodermic
i
cracked
i
want
you
to
get
me
a
book
on
greek
mythology
and
hurry
it
up
finding
a
greek
mythology
is
an
easy
task
at
two
in
the
morning
with
the
aid
of
fbi
men
malley
routed
a
book
dealer
out
of
bed
he
got
his
book
and
hurried
back
cercy
was
and
excited
and
harrison
and
his
helpers
were
working
away
at
three
crazy
looking
rigs
cercy
snatched
the
book
from
malley
looked
up
one
item
and
put
it
down
great
work
he
said
we
all
set
now
finished
harrison
just
about
harrison
and
ten
helpers
were
screwing
in
the
last
parts
will
you
tell
me
what
this
is
me
too
malley
put
in
i
do
mean
to
be
secretive
cercy
said
i
just
in
a
hurry
explain
as
we
go
along
he
stood
up
okay
let
wake
up
the
ambassador
they
watched
the
screen
as
a
bolt
of
electricity
leaped
from
the
ceiling
to
the
ambassador
bed
immediately
the
ambassador
vanished
now
he
a
part
of
that
stream
of
electrons
right
cercy
asked
that
what
he
told
us
malley
said
but
still
keeping
his
pattern
within
the
stream
cercy
continued
he
has
to
in
order
to
get
back
into
his
own
shape
now
we
start
the
first
disrupter
harrison
hooked
the
machine
into
circuit
and
sent
his
helpers
away
here
a
running
graph
of
the
electron
stream
cercy
said
see
the
difference
on
the
graph
there
was
an
irregular
series
of
peaks
and
valleys
constantly
shifting
and
leveling
do
you
remember
when
you
hypnotized
the
ambassador
he
talked
about
his
friend
who
been
killed
in
space
that
right
malley
nodded
his
friend
had
been
killed
by
something
that
had
just
popped
up
he
said
something
else
cercy
went
on
he
told
us
that
the
basic
organizing
force
of
the
universe
usually
stopped
things
like
that
what
does
that
mean
to
you
the
organizing
force
malley
repeated
slowly
did
darrig
say
that
that
was
a
new
natural
law
he
did
but
think
of
the
implications
as
darrig
did
if
an
organizing
principle
is
engaged
in
some
work
there
must
be
something
that
opposes
it
that
which
opposes
organization
is
chaos
that
what
darrig
thought
and
what
we
should
have
seen
the
chaos
is
underlying
and
out
of
it
there
arose
an
organizing
principle
this
principle
if
i
got
it
right
sought
to
suppress
the
fundamental
chaos
to
make
all
things
regular
but
the
chaos
still
boils
out
in
spots
as
alfern
found
out
perhaps
the
organizational
pattern
is
weaker
in
space
anyhow
those
spots
are
dangerous
until
the
organizing
principle
gets
to
work
on
them
illustration
illustration
he
turned
to
the
panel
okay
harrison
throw
in
the
second
disrupter
the
peaks
and
valleys
altered
on
the
graph
they
started
to
mount
in
crazy
meaningless
configurations
take
darrig
message
in
the
light
of
that
chaos
we
know
is
underlying
everything
was
formed
out
of
it
the
gorgon
medusa
was
something
that
be
looked
she
turned
men
into
stone
you
recall
destroyed
them
so
darrig
found
a
relationship
between
chaos
and
that
which
ca
be
looked
upon
all
with
regard
to
the
ambassador
of
course
the
ambassador
ca
look
upon
chaos
malley
cried
that
it
the
ambassador
is
capable
of
an
infinite
number
of
alterations
and
permutations
but
the
matrix
change
because
then
there
would
be
nothing
left
to
destroy
something
as
abstract
as
a
pattern
we
need
a
state
in
which
no
pattern
is
possible
a
state
of
chaos
the
third
disrupter
was
thrown
into
circuit
the
graph
looked
as
if
a
drunken
caterpillar
had
been
sketching
on
it
those
disrupters
are
harrison
idea
cercy
said
i
told
him
i
wanted
an
electrical
current
with
absolutely
no
coherent
pattern
the
disrupters
are
an
extension
of
radio
jamming
the
first
alters
the
electrical
pattern
that
its
purpose
to
produce
a
state
of
patternlessness
the
second
tries
to
destroy
the
pattern
left
by
the
first
the
third
tries
to
destroy
the
pattern
made
by
the
first
two
they
fed
back
then
and
any
remaining
pattern
is
systematically
destroyed
in
circuit
i
hope
this
is
supposed
to
produce
a
state
of
chaos
malley
asked
looking
into
the
screen
for
a
while
there
was
only
the
whining
of
the
machines
and
the
crazy
doodling
of
the
graph
then
in
the
middle
of
the
ambassador
room
a
spot
appeared
it
wavered
shrunk
expanded
what
happened
was
indescribable
all
they
knew
was
that
everything
within
the
spot
had
disappeared
switch
it
off
cercy
shouted
harrison
cut
the
switch
the
spot
continued
to
grow
how
is
it
we
able
to
look
at
it
malley
asked
staring
at
the
screen
the
shield
of
perseus
remember
cercy
said
using
it
as
a
mirror
he
could
look
at
medusa
it
still
growing
malley
shouted
there
was
a
calculated
risk
in
all
this
cercy
said
there
always
the
possibility
that
the
chaos
may
go
on
unchecked
if
that
happens
it
wo
matter
much
what
the
spot
stopped
growing
its
edges
wavered
and
rippled
and
then
it
started
to
shrink
the
organizing
principle
cercy
said
and
collapsed
into
a
chair
any
sign
of
the
ambassador
he
asked
in
a
few
minutes
the
spot
was
still
wavering
then
it
was
gone
instantly
there
was
an
explosion
the
steel
walls
buckled
inward
but
held
the
screen
went
dead
the
spot
removed
all
the
air
from
the
room
cercy
explained
as
well
as
the
furniture
and
the
ambassador
he
could
take
it
malley
said
no
pattern
can
cohere
in
a
state
of
patternlessness
he
gone
to
join
alfern
malley
started
to
giggle
cercy
felt
like
joining
him
but
pulled
himself
together
take
it
easy
he
said
we
not
through
yet
sure
we
are
the
ambassador
is
out
of
the
way
but
there
still
an
alien
fleet
homing
in
on
this
region
of
space
a
fleet
so
strong
we
could
scratch
it
with
an
they
be
looking
for
us
he
stood
up
go
home
and
get
some
sleep
something
tells
me
that
tomorrow
going
to
have
to
start
figuring
out
some
way
of
camouflaging
a
planet
