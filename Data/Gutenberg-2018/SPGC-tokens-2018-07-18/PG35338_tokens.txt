chapter
the
first
a
day
with
the
popes
an
extremely
pretty
girl
occupied
a
compartment
in
one
of
those
trains
which
percolate
through
the
rural
tranquillities
of
middle
england
from
ganford
in
oxfordshire
to
rumbold
junction
in
kent
she
was
going
to
join
her
family
at
buryhamstreet
after
a
visit
to
some
gloucestershire
friends
her
father
pope
once
a
leader
in
the
world
and
now
by
retirement
a
gentleman
had
taken
the
buryhamstreet
vicarage
furnished
for
two
months
beginning
on
the
fifteenth
of
july
at
his
maximum
summer
rental
of
seven
guineas
a
week
his
daughter
was
on
her
way
to
this
retreat
at
first
she
had
been
an
animated
traveller
erect
and
keenly
regardful
of
every
detail
upon
the
platforms
of
the
stations
at
which
her
conveyance
lingered
but
the
tedium
of
the
journey
and
the
warmth
of
the
sunny
afternoon
had
relaxed
her
pose
by
imperceptible
degrees
and
she
sat
now
comfortably
in
the
corner
with
her
neat
toes
upon
the
seat
before
her
ready
to
drop
them
primly
at
the
first
sign
of
a
her
expression
lapsed
more
and
more
towards
an
almost
somnolent
reverie
she
wished
she
had
not
taken
a
ticket
because
then
she
might
have
afforded
a
cup
of
tea
at
reading
and
so
fortified
herself
against
this
insinuating
indolence
she
was
travelling
second
class
instead
of
third
as
she
ought
to
have
done
through
one
of
those
lapses
so
inevitable
to
young
people
in
her
position
the
two
carmel
boys
and
a
cousin
two
greyhounds
and
a
chow
had
come
to
see
her
off
they
had
made
a
brilliant
and
prosperous
group
on
the
platform
and
extorted
the
manifest
admiration
of
two
youthful
porters
and
it
had
been
altogether
too
much
for
marjorie
pope
to
admit
it
was
the
family
custom
except
when
her
father
nerves
had
to
be
considered
to
go
third
class
so
she
had
made
a
hasty
calculation
she
knew
her
balance
to
a
penny
because
of
the
recent
tipping
and
found
it
would
just
run
to
it
fourpence
remained
and
there
would
be
a
porter
at
buryhamstreet
her
mother
had
said
you
will
have
ample
well
opinions
of
amplitude
vary
with
numerous
details
fresh
in
her
mind
marjorie
decided
it
would
be
wiser
to
avoid
financial
discussion
during
her
first
few
days
at
buryhamstreet
there
was
much
in
marjorie
equipment
in
the
key
of
travelling
second
class
at
the
sacrifice
of
afternoon
tea
there
was
for
example
a
certain
quiet
goodness
of
style
about
her
clothes
though
the
skirt
betrayed
age
and
an
entire
absence
of
style
about
her
luggage
which
was
all
in
the
compartment
with
her
and
which
consisted
of
a
distended
a
very
good
tennis
racquet
in
a
stretcher
a
portmanteau
of
cheap
white
basketwork
held
together
by
straps
and
a
very
new
and
meretricious
of
imitation
morocco
which
had
been
one
of
her
chief
financial
errors
at
oxbridge
the
collection
was
eloquent
indeed
of
incompatible
standards
marjorie
had
a
chin
that
was
small
in
size
if
resolute
in
form
and
a
mouth
that
was
not
noticeably
soft
and
weak
because
it
was
conspicuously
soft
and
pretty
her
nose
was
delicately
aquiline
and
very
subtly
and
finely
modelled
and
she
looked
out
upon
the
world
with
steady
eyes
beneath
broad
level
brows
that
contradicted
in
a
large
measure
the
hint
of
weakness
below
she
had
an
abundance
of
hair
which
flowed
back
very
prettily
from
her
broad
low
forehead
and
over
her
delicate
ears
and
she
had
that
clear
skin
that
goes
so
well
with
reddish
hair
she
had
a
very
dainty
neck
and
the
long
slender
lines
of
her
body
were
full
of
the
promise
of
a
riper
beauty
she
had
the
good
open
shoulders
of
a
and
a
swimmer
some
day
she
was
to
be
a
tall
ruddy
beautiful
woman
she
wore
simple
clothes
of
silvery
grey
and
soft
green
and
about
her
waist
was
a
belt
of
grey
leather
in
which
there
now
wilted
two
roses
that
was
the
visible
marjorie
somewhere
out
of
time
and
space
was
an
invisible
marjorie
who
looked
out
on
the
world
with
those
steady
eyes
and
smiled
or
drooped
with
the
soft
red
lips
and
dreamt
and
wondered
and
desired
what
a
queer
thing
the
invisible
human
being
would
appear
if
by
some
discovery
as
yet
inconceivable
some
spiritual
photography
we
could
flash
it
into
sight
long
ago
i
read
a
book
called
soul
shapes
that
was
full
of
ingenious
ideas
but
i
doubt
very
much
if
the
thing
so
revealed
would
have
any
shape
any
abiding
solid
outline
at
all
it
is
something
more
fluctuating
and
discursive
than
that
at
any
rate
for
every
one
young
enough
not
to
have
set
and
hardened
things
come
into
it
and
become
it
things
drift
out
of
it
and
cease
to
be
it
things
turn
upside
down
in
it
and
change
and
colour
and
dissolve
and
grow
and
eddy
about
and
blend
into
each
other
one
might
figure
it
i
suppose
as
a
preposterous
jumble
animated
by
a
will
a
floundering
disconnectedness
through
which
an
old
hump
of
impulse
rises
and
thrusts
unaccountably
a
river
beast
of
purpose
wallowing
in
a
back
eddy
of
mud
and
weeds
and
floating
objects
and
creatures
drowned
now
the
sunshine
of
gladness
makes
it
all
vivid
now
it
is
sombre
and
grimly
insistent
under
the
sky
of
some
darkling
mood
now
an
emotional
gale
sweeps
across
it
and
it
is
one
confused
agitation
and
surely
these
invisible
selves
of
men
were
never
so
jumbled
so
crowded
complicated
and
stirred
about
as
they
are
at
the
present
time
once
i
am
told
they
had
a
sort
of
order
were
sphered
in
religious
beliefs
crystal
clear
were
arranged
in
a
cosmogony
that
fitted
them
as
hand
fits
glove
were
separated
by
definite
standards
of
right
and
wrong
which
presented
life
as
planned
in
all
its
essential
aspects
from
the
cradle
to
the
grave
things
are
so
no
longer
that
sphere
is
broken
for
most
of
us
even
if
it
is
tied
about
and
mended
again
it
is
burst
like
a
seed
case
things
have
fallen
out
and
things
have
fallen
in
can
i
convey
in
any
measure
how
it
was
with
marjorie
what
was
her
religion
in
college
forms
and
returns
and
suchlike
documents
she
would
describe
herself
as
church
of
england
she
had
been
baptized
according
to
the
usages
of
that
body
but
she
had
hitherto
evaded
confirmation
into
it
and
although
it
is
a
large
wealthy
and
powerful
organization
with
many
minds
to
serve
it
it
had
never
succeeded
in
getting
into
her
quick
and
apprehensive
intelligence
any
lucid
and
persuasive
conception
of
what
it
considered
god
and
the
universe
were
up
to
with
her
it
had
failed
to
catch
her
attention
and
state
itself
to
her
a
number
of
humorous
and
other
writers
and
the
general
trend
of
talk
around
her
and
perhaps
her
own
shrewd
little
observation
of
superficial
things
had
on
the
other
hand
created
a
fairly
definite
belief
in
her
that
it
as
a
matter
of
fact
up
to
very
much
at
all
that
what
it
said
said
with
that
absolute
honesty
which
is
a
logical
necessity
in
every
religious
authority
and
that
its
hierarchy
had
all
sorts
of
political
and
social
considerations
confusing
its
treatment
of
her
immortal
soul
marjorie
followed
her
father
in
abstaining
from
church
he
too
professed
himself
church
of
england
but
he
was
if
we
are
to
set
aside
merely
superficial
classifications
an
irascible
atheist
with
a
respect
for
usage
and
good
taste
and
an
abject
fear
of
the
disapproval
of
other
gentlemen
of
his
class
for
the
rest
he
secretly
disliked
clergymen
on
account
of
the
peculiarity
of
their
collars
and
a
certain
influence
they
had
with
women
when
marjorie
at
the
age
of
fourteen
had
displayed
a
hankering
after
ecclesiastical
ceremony
and
emotional
religion
he
had
declared
we
do
want
any
of
nonsense
and
sent
her
into
the
country
to
a
farm
where
there
were
young
calves
and
a
lamb
and
kittens
at
times
her
mother
went
to
church
and
displayed
considerable
orthodoxy
and
punctilio
at
times
the
good
lady
did
and
at
times
she
thought
in
a
way
that
there
was
a
lot
in
christian
science
and
subjected
herself
to
the
ministrations
of
an
american
named
silas
root
but
his
ministrations
were
too
expensive
for
continuous
use
and
so
the
old
faith
did
not
lose
its
hold
upon
the
family
altogether
at
school
marjorie
had
been
taught
what
i
may
best
describe
as
muffled
christianity
a
temperate
and
discreet
system
designed
primarily
not
to
irritate
parents
in
which
the
painful
symbol
of
the
crucifixion
and
the
riddle
of
what
salvation
was
to
save
her
from
and
indeed
the
coarser
aspects
of
religion
generally
were
entirely
subordinate
to
images
of
amiable
perambulations
and
a
rich
mist
of
finer
feelings
she
had
been
shielded
not
only
from
arguments
against
her
religion
but
from
arguments
for
it
the
two
things
go
together
and
i
do
not
think
it
was
particularly
her
fault
if
she
was
now
growing
up
like
the
great
majority
of
respectable
english
people
with
her
religious
faculty
as
it
were
artificially
faded
and
an
acquired
disposition
to
regard
any
speculation
of
why
she
was
and
whence
and
whither
as
rather
foolish
not
very
important
and
in
the
very
worst
possible
taste
and
so
the
crystal
globe
being
broken
which
once
held
souls
together
you
may
expect
to
find
her
a
little
dispersed
and
inconsistent
in
her
motives
and
with
none
of
that
assurance
a
simpler
age
possessed
of
the
exact
specification
of
goodness
or
badness
the
exact
delimitation
of
right
and
wrong
indeed
she
did
not
live
in
a
world
of
right
and
wrong
or
anything
so
stern
horrid
and
jolly
had
replaced
these
archaic
orientations
in
a
world
where
a
mercantile
gentility
has
conquered
passion
and
god
is
neither
blasphemed
nor
adored
there
necessarily
arises
this
generation
of
young
people
a
little
perplexed
indeed
and
with
a
sense
of
something
missing
but
feeling
their
way
inevitably
at
last
to
the
great
releasing
question
then
why
should
we
have
a
good
time
yet
there
was
something
in
marjorie
as
in
most
human
beings
that
demanded
some
general
idea
some
aim
to
hold
her
life
together
a
girl
upon
the
borders
of
her
set
at
college
was
fond
of
the
phrase
living
for
the
moment
and
marjorie
associated
with
it
the
speaker
lax
mouth
eyes
soft
boneless
face
and
a
habit
of
squawking
and
bouncing
in
a
forced
and
graceless
manner
natural
disposition
was
to
deal
with
life
in
a
steadier
spirit
than
that
yet
all
sorts
of
powers
and
forces
were
at
work
in
her
some
exalted
some
elvish
some
vulgar
some
subtle
she
felt
keenly
and
desired
strongly
and
in
effect
she
came
perhaps
nearer
the
realization
of
that
offending
phrase
than
its
original
exponent
she
had
a
clean
intensity
of
feeling
that
made
her
delight
in
a
thousand
various
things
in
sunlight
and
textures
and
the
vividly
quick
acts
of
animals
in
landscape
and
the
beauty
of
other
girls
in
wit
and
people
voices
and
good
strong
reasoning
and
the
desire
and
skill
of
art
she
had
a
clear
rapid
memory
that
made
her
excel
perhaps
a
little
too
easily
at
school
and
college
an
eagerness
of
sympathetic
interest
that
won
people
very
quickly
and
led
to
disappointments
and
a
very
strong
sense
of
the
primary
importance
of
miss
marjorie
pope
in
the
world
and
when
any
very
definite
dream
of
what
she
would
like
to
be
and
what
she
would
like
to
do
such
as
being
the
principal
of
a
ladies
college
or
the
first
woman
member
of
parliament
or
the
wife
of
a
barbaric
chief
in
borneo
or
a
great
explorer
or
the
wife
of
a
millionaire
and
a
great
social
leader
or
george
sand
or
saint
teresa
had
had
possession
of
her
imagination
for
a
few
weeks
an
entirely
contrasted
and
equally
attractive
dream
would
presently
arise
beside
it
and
compete
with
it
and
replace
it
it
was
so
much
that
she
turned
against
the
old
one
as
that
she
was
attracted
by
the
new
and
she
forgot
the
old
dream
rather
than
abandoned
it
simply
because
she
was
only
one
person
and
had
therefore
the
possibility
of
realizing
both
in
certain
types
marjorie
impressionability
aroused
a
passion
of
proselytism
people
of
the
most
diverse
kinds
sought
to
influence
her
and
they
invariably
did
so
quite
a
number
of
people
including
her
mother
and
the
principal
of
her
college
believed
themselves
to
be
the
leading
influence
in
her
life
and
this
was
particularly
the
case
with
her
aunt
plessington
her
aunt
plessington
was
devoted
to
social
and
political
work
of
an
austere
and
aggressive
sort
in
which
plessington
participated
she
was
childless
and
had
a
movement
of
her
own
the
good
habits
movement
a
progressive
movement
of
the
utmost
scope
and
benevolence
which
aimed
at
extensive
interferences
with
the
food
and
domestic
intimacies
of
the
more
defenceless
lower
classes
by
means
ultimately
of
legislation
and
she
had
marjorie
up
to
see
her
took
her
for
long
walks
while
she
influenced
with
earnestness
and
vigour
and
at
times
had
an
air
of
bequeathing
her
mantle
movement
and
everything
quite
definitely
to
her
little
madge
she
spoke
of
training
her
niece
to
succeed
her
and
bought
all
the
novels
of
humphry
ward
for
her
as
they
appeared
in
the
hope
of
quickening
in
her
that
flame
of
ambition
that
insatiable
craving
for
with
important
guests
which
is
so
distinctive
of
the
more
influential
variety
of
english
womanhood
it
was
due
rather
to
her
own
habit
of
monologue
than
to
any
reserve
on
the
part
of
marjorie
that
she
entertained
the
belief
that
her
niece
was
entirely
acquiescent
in
these
projects
they
went
into
marjorie
mind
and
passed
for
nearly
a
week
it
is
true
she
had
dramatized
herself
as
the
angel
and
inspiration
of
some
great
modern
statesman
but
this
had
been
ousted
by
a
far
more
insistent
dream
begotten
by
a
picture
she
had
seen
in
some
exhibition
of
a
life
of
careless
savagery
whose
central
and
constantly
recurrent
incident
was
the
riding
of
barebacked
horses
out
of
forest
into
a
foamy
sunlit
sea
in
a
costume
that
would
certainly
have
struck
aunt
plessington
as
a
mistake
if
you
could
have
seen
marjorie
in
her
railway
compartment
with
the
sunshine
sunshine
mottled
by
the
dirty
window
tangled
in
her
hair
and
creeping
to
and
fro
over
her
face
as
the
train
followed
the
curves
of
the
line
you
would
certainly
have
agreed
with
me
that
she
was
pretty
and
you
might
even
have
thought
her
beautiful
but
it
was
necessary
to
fall
in
love
with
marjorie
before
you
could
find
her
absolutely
beautiful
you
might
have
speculated
just
what
business
was
going
on
behind
those
drowsily
thoughtful
eyes
if
you
are
as
people
say
victorian
you
might
even
have
whispered
day
dreams
at
the
sight
of
her
she
dreaming
and
in
a
sense
she
was
thinking
of
beautiful
things
but
only
mediately
she
was
thinking
how
very
much
she
would
enjoy
spending
freely
and
vigorously
quite
a
considerable
amount
of
money
heaps
of
money
you
see
the
carmels
with
whom
she
had
just
been
staying
were
shockingly
well
off
they
had
two
motor
cars
with
them
in
the
country
and
the
boys
had
the
use
of
the
second
one
as
though
it
was
just
an
old
bicycle
marjorie
had
had
a
cheap
white
made
the
year
before
by
a
chelsea
french
girl
a
happy
find
of
her
mother
and
it
was
shapely
and
simple
and
not
at
all
bad
and
she
had
worn
her
green
beads
and
her
egyptian
necklace
of
jade
but
kitty
carmel
and
her
sister
had
had
a
new
costume
nearly
every
night
and
pretty
bracelets
and
rubies
big
pearls
and
woven
gold
and
half
a
score
of
delightful
and
precious
things
for
neck
and
hair
everything
in
the
place
was
bright
and
good
and
abundant
the
servants
were
easy
and
without
a
trace
of
hurry
or
resentment
and
one
did
have
to
be
sharp
about
the
eggs
and
things
at
breakfast
in
the
morning
or
go
without
all
through
the
day
and
even
when
they
had
gone
to
bathe
from
the
smart
little
white
and
green
shed
on
the
upper
lake
marjorie
had
been
made
to
feel
the
insufficiency
of
her
equipment
kitty
carmel
being
possessed
her
own
and
had
accounts
running
at
half
a
dozen
shops
and
both
sisters
had
furnished
their
own
rooms
according
to
their
taste
with
a
sense
of
obvious
effect
that
had
set
marjorie
speculating
just
how
a
room
might
be
done
by
a
girl
with
a
real
eye
for
colour
and
a
real
brain
behind
it
the
train
slowed
down
for
the
seventeenth
time
marjorie
looked
up
and
read
buryhamstreet
her
reverie
vanished
and
by
a
complex
but
almost
instantaneous
movement
she
had
her
basket
off
the
rack
and
the
carriage
door
open
she
became
teeming
anticipations
there
advancing
in
a
string
were
daffy
her
elder
sister
theodore
her
younger
brother
and
the
dog
toupee
sydney
and
rom
had
come
daffy
was
not
copper
red
like
her
sister
but
really
quite
coarsely
she
was
bigger
than
marjorie
and
with
irregular
teeth
instead
of
marjorie
neat
row
she
confessed
them
in
a
broad
simple
smile
of
welcome
theodore
was
hatless
rustily
and
now
a
wealth
of
gesture
the
dog
toupee
was
straining
at
a
leash
and
doing
its
best
in
a
yapping
confused
manner
to
welcome
the
wrong
people
by
getting
its
lead
round
their
legs
toupee
cried
marjorie
waving
the
basket
toupee
they
all
called
it
toupee
because
it
was
like
one
but
the
name
was
forbidden
in
her
father
hearing
her
father
had
decided
that
the
proper
name
for
a
family
dog
in
england
is
towser
and
did
his
utmost
to
suppress
a
sobriquet
that
was
at
once
unprecedented
and
not
in
the
best
possible
taste
which
was
why
the
whole
family
with
the
exception
of
pope
of
course
stuck
to
toupee
marjorie
flashed
a
second
contrast
with
the
carmel
splendours
hullo
old
daffy
what
it
like
she
asked
handing
out
the
basket
as
her
sister
came
up
it
a
lark
said
daffy
where
the
thoddy
said
marjorie
following
up
the
with
the
lend
a
hand
stow
it
toupee
said
theodore
and
caught
the
in
time
in
another
moment
marjorie
was
out
of
the
train
had
done
the
swift
kissing
proper
to
the
occasion
and
rolled
a
hand
over
head
toupee
who
after
a
passionate
lunge
at
a
particularly
savoury
drover
from
the
next
compartment
was
now
frantically
trying
to
indicate
that
marjorie
was
the
one
human
being
he
had
ever
cared
for
brother
and
sister
were
both
sketching
out
the
state
of
affairs
at
buryhamstreet
vicarage
in
rapid
competitive
jerks
each
eager
to
tell
things
first
and
the
whole
party
moved
confusedly
towards
the
station
exit
things
pelted
into
marjorie
mind
we
got
an
old
i
thought
we
should
get
here
ever
madge
we
can
go
up
the
church
tower
whenever
we
like
only
old
daffy
wo
let
me
shin
up
the
flagstaff
it
safe
you
fall
off
if
you
tried
had
positively
to
get
out
at
the
level
crossing
and
him
over
there
a
sort
of
moat
in
the
garden
you
never
saw
such
furniture
madge
and
the
study
it
hung
with
texts
and
stuffed
with
books
about
the
scarlet
woman
rather
good
it
a
broadwood
the
dad
got
a
war
on
about
the
tennis
net
oh
frightful
you
see
it
wo
keep
up
he
had
a
letter
kept
waiting
by
the
for
a
fortnight
and
it
a
terror
at
breakfast
says
the
motor
people
have
used
influence
to
silence
him
says
that
a
game
two
can
play
at
old
sid
got
herself
upset
stuffing
windfalls
rather
a
sell
for
old
sid
considering
how
refined
she
getting
there
was
a
brief
lull
as
the
party
got
into
the
waiting
governess
cart
toupee
after
a
preliminary
refusal
to
enter
made
a
determined
attempt
on
the
best
seat
from
which
he
would
be
able
to
bark
in
a
persistent
official
manner
at
anything
that
passed
that
suppressed
and
proposal
to
drive
refused
they
were
able
to
start
and
attention
was
concentrated
upon
daffy
negotiation
of
the
station
approach
marjorie
turned
on
her
brother
with
a
smile
of
warm
affection
how
are
you
old
theodore
i
all
right
old
madge
mummy
every
one
all
right
said
theodore
if
it
was
for
that
damned
infernal
net
ssssh
cried
both
sisters
together
says
it
said
theodore
both
sisters
conveyed
a
grave
and
relentless
disapproval
pretty
bit
of
road
said
marjorie
i
like
that
little
house
at
the
corner
a
pause
and
the
eyes
of
the
sisters
met
here
said
daffy
marjorie
affected
ignorance
who
here
vostro
senior
just
as
though
a
fellow
could
understand
your
kiddy
little
italian
said
theodore
pulling
toupee
ear
oh
well
i
thought
he
might
be
said
marjorie
regardless
of
her
brother
oh
said
daffy
i
did
know
both
sisters
looked
at
each
other
and
then
both
glanced
at
theodore
he
met
marjorie
eyes
with
a
grimace
of
profound
solemnity
little
brothers
he
said
should
know
just
as
though
they
did
rot
but
let
change
the
subject
my
dears
all
the
same
lem
me
see
there
are
a
new
sort
of
flea
on
toupee
madge
that
he
gets
from
the
hens
a
new
sort
corrected
daffy
he
horrider
than
ever
madge
he
leaves
his
soap
in
soak
now
to
make
us
think
he
has
used
it
this
is
the
village
high
street
is
it
jolly
corners
do
people
said
theodore
with
a
critical
eye
to
the
driving
marjorie
surveyed
the
high
street
while
daffy
devoted
a
few
moments
to
theodore
the
particular
success
of
the
village
was
its
brace
of
chestnut
trees
which
with
that
noble
disregard
of
triteness
which
is
one
of
the
charms
of
villages
the
whole
world
over
shadowed
the
village
smithy
on
either
side
of
the
roadway
between
it
and
the
paths
was
a
careless
width
of
vivid
grass
protected
by
white
posts
which
gave
way
to
admit
a
generous
access
on
either
hand
to
a
jolly
public
house
leering
over
red
blinds
and
swinging
a
painted
sign
against
its
competitor
several
of
the
cottages
had
real
thatch
and
most
had
porches
they
had
creepers
nailed
to
their
faces
and
their
gardens
crowded
now
with
flowers
marigolds
begonias
snapdragon
delphiniums
white
foxgloves
and
monkshood
seemed
almost
too
good
to
be
true
the
doctor
house
was
pleasantly
georgian
and
the
village
shop
which
was
also
a
post
and
telegraph
office
lay
back
with
a
slight
air
of
repletion
keeping
its
bulging
double
wide
open
in
a
manifest
attempt
not
to
fall
asleep
two
score
of
boys
and
pinafored
girls
were
drilling
upon
a
bald
space
of
ground
before
the
village
school
and
near
by
the
national
emotion
at
the
diamond
jubilee
of
queen
victoria
had
evoked
an
artistic
of
grey
stone
beyond
the
subsequent
green
there
were
the
correctest
geese
thereon
the
village
narrowed
almost
to
a
normal
road
again
and
then
recalling
itself
with
a
start
lifted
a
little
to
the
churchyard
wall
about
the
grey
and
ample
church
it
just
like
all
the
villages
that
ever
were
said
marjorie
and
gave
a
cry
of
delight
when
daffy
pointing
to
the
white
gate
between
two
elm
trees
that
led
to
the
vicarage
remarked
that
us
in
confirmation
of
which
statement
sydney
and
rom
the
two
sisters
next
in
succession
to
marjorie
and
with
a
strong
tendency
to
be
twins
in
spite
of
the
year
between
them
appeared
in
a
state
of
vociferous
incivility
opening
the
way
for
the
sydney
was
sydney
and
rom
was
just
short
for
romola
one
of
her
mother
favourite
heroines
in
fiction
old
madge
they
said
and
then
throwing
respect
to
the
winds
old
gargoo
which
was
marjorie
forbidden
nickname
and
short
for
gargoyle
though
surely
only
victorian
gothic
ever
produced
a
gargoyle
that
had
the
remotest
right
to
be
associated
with
the
neat
brightness
of
marjorie
face
she
overlooked
the
offence
and
the
boarded
the
cart
from
behind
whereupon
the
already
overburthened
donkey
being
old
and
in
a
manner
wise
quickened
his
pace
for
the
house
to
get
the
whole
thing
over
it
really
an
avenue
said
daffy
but
marjorie
with
her
mind
strung
up
to
the
carmel
standards
could
agree
it
was
like
calling
a
row
of
potsdam
grenadiers
the
trees
were
at
irregular
distances
of
various
ages
and
mostly
on
one
side
still
it
was
a
shady
pleasant
approach
and
the
vicarage
was
truly
very
interesting
and
amusing
to
these
londoners
accustomed
to
live
in
a
state
of
compression
elbows
practically
touching
in
a
tall
narrow
stucco
house
all
window
and
staircase
in
a
despondent
brompton
square
there
was
an
effect
of
maundering
freedom
about
the
place
of
enlargement
almost
to
the
pitch
of
adventure
and
sunlight
to
the
pitch
of
intoxication
the
house
itself
was
long
and
low
as
if
a
london
house
holidaying
in
the
country
had
flung
itself
asprawl
it
had
two
disconnected
and
roomy
staircases
and
when
it
had
exhausted
itself
completely
as
a
house
it
turned
to
the
right
and
began
again
as
rambling
empty
stables
coach
house
cart
sheds
men
bedrooms
up
ladders
and
outhouses
of
the
most
various
kinds
on
one
hand
was
a
neglected
orchard
in
the
front
of
the
house
was
a
bald
lawn
area
capable
of
simultaneous
tennis
and
croquet
and
at
the
other
side
a
copious
and
confused
vegetable
and
flower
garden
full
of
roses
honesty
hollyhocks
and
suchlike
herbaceous
biennials
and
perennials
lapsed
at
last
into
shrubbery
where
a
weedy
lagoon
of
uncertain
aims
which
had
evidently
as
a
rustic
bridge
and
a
weeping
willow
confessed
aspired
to
be
an
ornamental
water
declined
at
last
to
ducks
and
there
was
access
to
the
church
and
the
key
of
the
church
tower
and
one
went
across
the
corner
of
the
lawn
and
by
a
little
iron
gate
into
the
churchyard
to
decipher
inscriptions
as
if
the
tombs
of
all
buryhamstreet
were
no
more
than
a
part
of
the
accommodation
relinquished
by
the
vicar
household
marjorie
was
hurried
over
the
chief
points
of
all
this
at
a
breakneck
pace
by
sydney
and
rom
and
when
sydney
was
called
away
to
the
horrors
of
practice
for
sydney
in
spite
of
considerable
reluctance
was
destined
by
her
father
to
be
the
musical
one
rom
developed
a
copious
affection
due
apparently
to
some
occult
æsthetic
influence
in
marjorie
and
green
and
led
her
into
the
unlocked
vestry
and
there
prayed
in
a
whisper
that
she
might
be
given
one
good
hug
just
and
so
they
came
out
with
their
arms
about
each
other
very
affectionately
to
visit
the
lagoon
again
and
then
rom
remembered
that
marjorie
had
seen
either
the
in
the
orchard
or
the
hen
with
nine
chicks
somewhere
among
all
these
interests
came
tea
and
pope
pope
kissed
her
daughter
with
an
air
of
having
really
wanted
to
kiss
her
half
an
hour
ago
but
of
having
been
distracted
since
she
was
a
little
woman
with
a
close
resemblance
to
all
her
children
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
they
were
markedly
dissimilar
one
to
the
other
except
only
that
they
took
their
ruddy
colourings
from
their
father
she
was
dressed
in
a
neat
blue
dress
that
had
perhaps
been
hurriedly
chosen
and
her
method
of
doing
her
hair
was
a
manifest
compromise
between
duty
and
pleasure
she
embarked
at
once
upon
an
exposition
of
the
bedroom
arrangements
which
evidently
involved
difficult
issues
marjorie
was
to
share
a
room
with
daffy
that
was
the
gist
of
it
as
the
only
other
available
apartment
originally
promised
to
marjorie
had
been
secured
by
pope
for
what
he
called
his
matutinal
ablutions
tub
then
when
your
aunt
plessington
comes
you
wo
have
to
move
said
pope
with
an
air
of
a
special
concession
your
father
looking
forward
to
seeing
you
but
he
must
be
disturbed
just
yet
he
in
the
vicar
study
he
had
his
tea
in
there
he
writing
a
letter
to
the
answering
something
they
said
in
a
leader
and
also
a
private
note
calling
attention
to
their
delay
in
printing
his
previous
communication
and
he
wants
to
be
delicately
ironical
without
being
in
any
way
offensive
he
wants
to
hint
without
actually
threatening
that
very
probably
he
will
go
over
to
the
altogether
if
they
do
not
become
more
attentive
the
used
to
print
his
letters
punctually
but
latterly
these
automobile
people
seem
to
have
got
hold
of
it
he
has
the
window
on
the
lawn
open
so
that
i
think
perhaps
we
better
not
stay
out
here
for
fear
our
voices
might
disturb
him
better
get
right
round
the
other
side
of
the
church
said
daffy
he
hear
far
less
of
us
if
we
went
indoors
said
pope
the
vicarage
seemed
tight
packed
with
human
interest
for
marjorie
and
her
mother
and
sisters
going
over
houses
is
one
of
the
amusements
proper
to
her
sex
and
she
and
all
three
sisters
and
her
mother
as
soon
as
they
had
finished
an
inaudible
tea
went
to
see
the
bedroom
she
was
to
share
with
daffy
and
then
examined
carefully
and
in
order
the
furniture
and
decoration
of
the
other
bedrooms
went
through
the
rooms
downstairs
always
excepting
and
avoiding
very
carefully
and
closing
as
many
doors
as
possible
on
and
hushing
their
voices
whenever
they
approached
the
study
in
which
her
father
was
being
delicately
ironical
without
being
offensive
to
the
none
of
them
had
seen
any
of
the
vicarage
people
at
all
pope
had
come
on
a
bicycle
and
managed
all
the
negotiations
and
it
was
curious
to
speculate
about
the
individuals
whose
personalities
pervaded
the
worn
and
faded
furnishings
of
the
place
the
popes
inspection
came
at
times
i
think
dangerously
near
prying
the
ideals
of
decoration
and
interests
of
the
vanished
family
were
so
absolutely
dissimilar
to
the
london
standards
as
to
arouse
a
sort
of
astonished
wonder
in
their
minds
some
of
the
things
they
decided
were
perfectly
hideous
some
quaint
some
were
simply
and
weakly
silly
everything
was
different
from
hartstone
square
daffy
was
perhaps
more
inclined
to
contempt
and
pope
to
refined
amusement
and
witty
appreciation
than
marjorie
marjorie
felt
there
was
something
in
these
people
that
she
did
begin
to
understand
she
needed
some
missing
clue
that
would
unlock
the
secret
of
their
confused
peculiarity
she
was
one
of
those
people
who
have
an
almost
instinctive
turn
for
decoration
in
costume
and
furniture
she
had
already
had
a
taste
of
how
to
do
things
in
arranging
her
rooms
at
bennett
college
oxbridge
where
also
she
was
in
great
demand
among
the
richer
girls
as
an
adviser
she
knew
what
it
was
to
try
and
fail
as
well
as
to
try
and
succeed
and
these
people
she
felt
had
tried
for
anything
she
comprehended
she
could
quite
see
why
it
was
that
there
was
at
the
same
time
an
attempt
at
ornament
and
a
disregard
of
beauty
she
could
quite
do
as
her
mother
did
and
dismiss
it
as
an
absurdity
and
have
done
with
it
she
could
understand
too
why
everything
should
be
as
if
it
were
faded
and
weakened
from
something
originally
bright
and
clear
all
the
rooms
were
thick
with
queer
little
objects
that
indicated
a
quite
industry
in
the
production
of
work
there
were
embroidered
covers
for
nearly
every
article
on
the
and
mats
of
wool
and
crochet
wherever
anything
stood
on
anything
there
were
tidies
everywhere
and
odd
little
brackets
covered
with
gilded
and
varnished
fir
cones
and
bearing
framed
photographs
and
little
jars
and
all
sorts
of
colourless
dusty
little
objects
and
everywhere
on
the
walls
tacks
sustained
crossed
fans
with
badly
painted
flowers
or
transfer
pictures
there
was
a
jar
on
the
bedroom
mantel
covered
with
varnished
postage
stamps
and
containing
dried
grasses
there
seemed
to
be
a
moral
element
in
all
this
for
in
the
room
sydney
shared
with
rom
there
was
a
decorative
piece
of
lettering
which
declared
that
something
attempted
something
done
has
earned
a
night
repose
there
were
a
great
number
of
texts
that
set
marjorie
mind
stirring
dimly
with
intimations
of
a
missed
significance
over
her
own
bed
within
the
lattice
of
an
oxford
frame
was
the
photograph
of
a
picture
of
an
extremely
composed
young
woman
in
a
trailing
robe
clinging
to
the
rock
of
ages
in
the
midst
of
histrionically
aggressive
waves
and
she
had
a
feeling
rather
than
a
thought
that
perhaps
for
all
the
oddity
of
the
presentation
it
did
convey
something
acutely
desirable
that
she
herself
had
had
moods
when
she
would
have
found
something
very
comforting
in
just
such
an
impassioned
grip
and
on
a
framed
floriferous
card
these
incomprehensible
words
grace
is
sufficient
for
me
seemed
to
be
saying
something
to
her
tantalizingly
just
outside
her
range
of
apprehension
did
all
these
things
light
up
somehow
to
those
dispossessed
people
from
some
angle
she
did
attain
were
they
living
and
moving
realities
when
those
others
were
at
home
again
the
had
no
texts
it
was
altogether
more
pretentious
and
less
haunted
by
the
faint
and
faded
flavour
of
religion
that
pervaded
the
bedrooms
it
had
however
evidences
of
travel
in
switzerland
and
the
mediterranean
there
was
a
piano
in
black
and
gold
a
little
out
of
tune
and
surmounted
by
a
benares
brass
jar
enveloping
a
scarlet
geranium
in
a
pot
there
was
a
japanese
screen
of
gold
wrought
upon
black
that
screened
nothing
there
was
a
framed
of
jerusalem
hot
in
the
sunset
and
another
of
jerusalem
cold
under
a
moon
and
there
were
gourds
roses
of
jericho
sandalwood
rosaries
and
kindred
trash
from
the
holy
land
in
no
little
profusion
upon
a
such
books
as
the
room
had
contained
had
been
arranged
as
symmetrically
as
possible
about
a
large
lamp
upon
the
cloth
of
a
round
table
and
were
to
be
replaced
pope
said
at
their
departure
at
present
they
were
piled
on
a
the
girls
had
been
through
them
all
and
were
ready
with
the
choicer
morsels
for
marjorie
amusement
there
was
black
beauty
the
sympathetic
story
of
a
soundly
anglican
horse
and
a
large
bible
with
photographs
of
every
scriptural
picture
from
michael
angelo
to
doré
and
a
book
of
injunctions
to
young
ladies
upon
their
behaviour
and
deportment
that
rom
and
sydney
found
particularly
entertaining
marjorie
discovered
that
sydney
had
picked
up
a
new
favourite
phrase
i
afraid
we
all
dreadfully
cynical
said
sydney
several
times
a
more
advanced
note
was
struck
by
a
copy
of
aurora
leigh
richly
underlined
in
pencil
but
with
exclamation
marks
at
some
of
the
bolder
passages
and
presently
still
avoiding
the
open
study
window
very
elaborately
this
little
group
of
twentieth
century
people
went
again
into
the
church
the
church
whose
foundations
were
laid
in
foundations
of
rubble
and
cement
that
included
flat
roman
bricks
from
a
still
remoter
basilica
their
voices
dropped
instinctively
as
they
came
into
its
shaded
quiet
from
the
exterior
sunshine
marjorie
went
a
little
apart
and
sat
in
a
pew
that
gave
her
a
glimpse
of
the
one
good
window
rom
followed
her
and
perceiving
her
mood
to
be
restful
sat
a
yard
away
syd
began
a
whispered
dispute
with
her
mother
whether
it
was
possible
to
try
the
organ
and
whether
theodore
might
not
be
bribed
to
blow
daffy
discovered
relics
of
a
lepers
squint
and
a
stoup
and
then
went
to
scrutinize
the
lettering
of
the
ten
commandments
of
the
mosaic
law
that
shone
black
and
red
on
gold
on
either
side
of
the
monogram
behind
the
communion
table
that
had
once
been
the
altar
upon
a
notice
board
hung
about
the
waist
of
the
portly
pulpit
were
the
numbers
of
hymns
that
had
been
sung
three
days
ago
the
sound
protestantism
of
the
vicar
had
banished
superfluous
crosses
from
the
building
the
bible
reposed
upon
the
wings
of
a
great
brass
eagle
shining
blue
and
crimson
in
the
window
saint
christopher
carried
his
lord
what
a
harmonized
synthesis
of
conflicts
a
country
church
presents
what
invisible
mysteries
of
filiation
spread
between
these
ancient
ornaments
and
symbols
and
the
new
young
minds
from
the
whirlpool
of
the
town
that
looked
upon
them
now
with
such
bright
keen
eyes
wondering
a
little
feeling
a
little
missing
so
much
it
was
all
so
very
cool
and
quiet
now
with
something
of
the
immobile
serenity
of
death
when
pope
had
finished
his
letter
to
the
he
got
out
of
the
window
of
the
study
treading
on
a
as
he
did
so
he
was
the
sort
of
man
who
treads
on
partly
with
the
purpose
of
reading
his
composition
aloud
to
as
many
members
of
his
family
as
he
could
assemble
for
the
purpose
and
so
giving
them
a
chance
of
appreciating
the
nuances
of
his
irony
more
fully
than
if
they
saw
it
just
in
cold
print
without
the
advantage
of
his
intonation
and
partly
with
the
belated
idea
of
welcoming
marjorie
the
law
presented
a
rather
discouraging
desolation
then
he
became
aware
that
the
church
tower
frothed
with
his
daughters
in
view
of
his
need
of
an
audience
he
decided
after
a
brief
doubt
that
their
presence
there
was
unobjectionable
and
waved
his
amiably
marjorie
flapped
a
handkerchief
in
reply
the
subsequent
hour
was
just
the
sort
of
hour
that
gave
pope
an
almost
meteorological
importance
to
his
family
he
began
with
an
amiability
that
had
no
fault
except
perhaps
that
it
was
a
little
forced
after
the
epistolary
strain
in
the
study
and
his
welcome
to
marjorie
was
more
than
cordial
well
little
he
said
giving
her
an
affectionate
but
sound
and
heavy
thump
on
the
left
got
a
kiss
for
the
old
daddy
marjorie
submitted
a
cheek
that
right
said
pope
and
now
i
just
want
you
all
to
advise
me
he
led
the
way
to
a
group
of
wicker
garden
chairs
you
coming
mummy
he
said
and
seated
himself
comfortably
and
drew
out
a
spectacle
case
while
his
family
grouped
itself
dutifully
it
made
a
charming
little
picture
of
a
man
and
his
womankind
i
do
often
flatter
myself
he
said
but
this
time
i
think
i
been
neat
neat
the
word
for
it
he
cleared
his
throat
put
on
his
spectacles
and
emitted
a
long
flat
preliminary
note
rather
like
the
sound
of
a
child
trumpet
er
sir
rom
said
pope
do
creak
your
chair
it
daffy
mother
said
rom
oh
said
daffy
pope
paused
and
looked
with
a
warning
eye
over
his
left
at
rom
do
creak
your
chair
rom
he
said
when
your
mother
tells
you
i
was
creaking
my
chair
said
rom
i
heard
it
said
pope
suavely
it
was
daffy
your
mother
does
not
think
so
said
pope
oh
all
right
i
sit
on
the
ground
said
rom
crimson
to
the
roots
of
her
hair
me
too
said
daffy
i
rather
pope
watched
the
transfer
gravely
then
he
readjusted
his
glasses
cleared
his
throat
again
trumpeted
and
began
er
sir
ought
it
to
be
simply
father
for
an
editor
said
marjorie
perhaps
i
did
explain
marjorie
said
her
father
with
the
calm
of
great
and
dabbing
his
left
hand
on
the
manuscript
in
his
right
that
this
is
a
letter
a
private
letter
i
did
understand
said
marjorie
it
would
have
been
evident
as
i
went
on
said
pope
and
prepared
to
read
again
this
time
he
was
allowed
to
proceed
but
the
interruptions
had
ruffled
him
and
the
gentle
stresses
that
should
have
lifted
the
subtleties
of
his
irony
into
prominence
missed
the
words
and
he
had
to
go
back
and
do
his
sentences
again
then
rom
suddenly
horribly
uncontrollably
was
seized
with
hiccups
at
the
second
hiccup
pope
paused
and
looked
very
hard
at
his
daughter
with
magnified
eyes
as
he
was
about
to
resume
the
third
burst
its
way
through
the
unhappy
child
utmost
effort
pope
rose
with
an
awful
resignation
that
enough
he
said
he
regarded
the
vindictively
you
have
the
of
a
child
of
six
he
said
then
very
touchingly
to
pope
mummy
shall
we
try
a
game
of
tennis
with
the
new
generation
ca
you
read
it
after
supper
asked
pope
it
must
go
by
the
eight
post
said
pope
putting
the
masterpiece
into
his
breast
pocket
the
little
masterpiece
that
would
now
perhaps
never
be
read
aloud
to
any
human
being
daffy
dear
do
you
mind
going
in
for
the
racquets
and
balls
the
social
atmosphere
was
now
sultry
and
overcast
and
decision
to
spend
the
interval
before
daffy
returned
in
seeing
whether
he
could
do
something
to
the
net
which
was
certainly
very
unsatisfactory
did
not
improve
matters
then
unhappily
marjorie
who
had
got
rather
keen
upon
tennis
at
the
carmels
claimed
her
first
two
services
as
faults
contrary
to
the
etiquette
of
the
family
it
happened
that
pope
had
a
really
very
good
hard
difficult
serve
whose
only
defect
was
that
it
always
went
either
too
far
or
else
into
the
net
and
so
a
feeling
had
been
fostered
and
established
by
his
wife
that
on
the
whole
it
was
advisable
to
regard
the
former
variety
as
a
legitimate
extension
of
a
father
authority
naturally
therefore
pope
was
nettled
at
marjorie
ruling
and
his
irritation
increased
when
his
next
two
services
to
daffy
perished
in
the
net
damn
that
net
puts
one
eye
out
then
marjorie
gave
him
an
unexpected
soft
return
which
he
somehow
muffed
and
then
daffy
just
dropped
a
return
over
the
top
of
the
net
it
was
then
marjorie
turn
to
serve
which
she
did
with
a
new
twist
acquired
from
the
eldest
carmel
boy
that
struck
pope
as
go
on
he
said
concisely
fifteen
love
she
was
gentle
with
her
mother
and
they
got
their
first
rally
and
when
it
was
over
pope
had
to
explain
to
marjorie
that
if
she
returned
right
up
into
his
corner
of
the
court
he
would
have
to
run
backwards
very
fast
and
might
fall
over
down
the
silly
slope
at
that
end
she
would
have
to
consider
him
and
the
court
one
did
get
everything
out
of
a
game
by
playing
merely
to
win
she
said
all
right
daddy
rather
and
immediately
served
to
him
again
and
he
taken
a
little
unawares
hit
the
ball
with
the
edge
of
his
racquet
and
sent
it
out
and
then
he
changed
racquets
with
daffy
it
seemed
he
had
known
all
along
she
had
taken
his
but
he
had
preferred
to
say
nothing
uttered
a
word
of
advice
to
his
wife
just
on
her
stroke
and
she
failing
to
grasp
his
intention
as
quickly
as
she
ought
to
have
done
left
the
score
he
felt
better
when
he
returned
marjorie
serve
and
then
before
she
could
control
herself
she
repeated
her
new
unpleasant
trick
of
playing
into
the
corner
again
whereupon
leaping
back
with
an
agility
that
would
have
shamed
many
a
younger
man
pope
came
upon
disaster
he
went
spinning
down
the
treacherous
slope
behind
twisted
his
ankle
painfully
and
collapsed
against
the
iron
railings
of
the
shrubbery
it
was
too
much
and
he
lost
control
of
himself
his
daughters
had
one
instant
glimpse
of
the
linguistic
possibilities
of
a
strong
man
agony
i
told
her
he
went
on
as
if
he
had
said
nothing
for
a
second
perhaps
he
seemed
to
hesitate
upon
a
course
of
action
then
as
if
by
a
great
effort
he
took
his
coat
from
the
net
post
and
addressed
himself
houseward
incarnate
grand
dudgeon
limping
had
enough
of
it
mummy
he
said
and
added
some
happily
inaudible
comment
on
marjorie
new
style
of
play
the
evening
exercise
was
at
an
end
the
three
ladies
regarded
one
another
in
silence
for
some
moments
i
will
take
in
the
racquets
dear
said
pope
i
think
the
other
ball
is
at
your
end
said
daffy
the
apparatus
put
away
marjorie
and
her
sister
strolled
thoughtfully
away
from
the
house
there
croquet
here
too
said
daffy
we
not
had
the
things
out
yet
he
play
i
suppose
he
wants
to

course
said
marjorie
after
a
long
pause
there
no
with
dad
character
is
one
of
england
noblest
and
most
deliberate
products
but
some
englishmen
have
it
to
excess
pope
had
he
was
one
of
that
large
and
representative
class
which
imparts
a
dignity
to
national
commerce
by
inheriting
big
businesses
from
its
ancestors
he
was
a
by
birth
and
a
gentleman
by
education
and
training
he
had
been
to
city
merchant
and
cambridge
throughout
the
earlier
half
of
the
nineteenth
century
the
popes
had
been
the
princes
of
the
world
pope
had
been
a
north
london
wheelwright
of
conspicuous
dexterity
and
integrity
who
had
founded
the
family
business
his
son
grandfather
had
made
that
business
the
occupation
of
his
life
and
brought
it
to
the
pinnacle
of
his
son
who
was
grandfather
had
displayed
a
lesser
enthusiasm
left
the
house
at
the
works
for
a
home
ten
miles
away
and
sent
a
second
son
into
the
church
it
was
in
the
days
of
the
third
pope
that
the
business
ceased
to
expand
and
began
to
suffer
severely
from
the
competition
of
an
enterprising
person
who
had
originally
supplied
the
firm
with
varnish
gradually
picked
up
the
trade
in
most
other
materials
and
accessories
needed
in
and
passed
on
by
almost
imperceptible
stages
to
delivering
the
article
complete
dispensing
at
last
altogether
with
the
intervention
of
pope
and
son
to
the
customer
marjorie
father

succeeded
in
the
fulness
of
time
to
the
inheritance

insurgent
had
damaged
pope
was
a
man
of
firm
and
resentful
temper
with
an
admiration
for
cato
brutus
cincinnatus
cromwell
washington
and
the
sterner
heroes
generally
and
by
nature
a
little
and
offended
at
things
he
suffered
from
indigestion
and
extreme
irritability
he
found
himself
in
control
of
a
business
where
more
flexible
virtues
were
needed
the
popes
based
their
fame
on
a
heavy
proud
type
of
vehicle
which
the
increasing
luxury
and
triviality
of
the
age
tended
to
replace
by
lighter
forms
of
carriage
carriages
with
diminutive
and
apologetic
names
as
these
lighter
forms
were
not
only
lighter
but
less
expensive
pope
with
a
pathetic
confidence
in
the
loyalty
of
the
better
class
of
west
end
customer
determined
to
make
a
stand
against
them
he
was
the
sort
of
man
to
whom
making
a
stand
is
in
itself
a
sombre
joy
if
he
had
had
to
choose
his
pose
for
a
portrait
he
would
certainly
have
decided
to
have
one
foot
advanced
the
other
planted
like
a
british
oak
behind
the
arms
folded
and
the
brows
corrugated
making

unhappily
the

their
courses
and
the
general
improvement
of

throughout
the
country
fought
against
him
the
lighter
carriages
and
especially
the
lighter
carriages
of
that
firm
which
was
now
absorbing
businesses
right
and
left
prevailed
over
resistance
for
crossing

for
being
run
away
with
by
frantic
horses
or
crushing

personal
enemy
there
can
be
no
doubt
the
pope
carriages
remained
to
the
very
last
the
best
possible
ones
and
fully
worth
the
inflexible
price
demanded
unhappily
all
carriages
in
a
civilization
essentially
decadent
are
not
subjected
to
these
tests
and
the
manufactures
of
his
rivals
were
not
only
much
cheaper
but
had
a
sort
of
meretricious
smartness
a
disingenuous
elasticity
above
all
a
levity
hateful
indeed
to
the
spirit
of
pope
yet
attractive
to
the
wanton
customer
business
dwindled
nevertheless
the
habitual
element
in
the
good
class
customer
did
keep
things
going
albeit
on
a
shrinking
scale
until
pope
came
to
the
unfortunate
decision
that
he
would
make
a
stand
against
automobiles
he
regarded
them
as
an
intrusive
nuisance
which
had
to
be
seen
only
to
be
disowned
by
the
landed
gentry
of
england
rather
than
build
a
car
he
said
he
would
go
out
of
business
he
went
out
of
business
within
five
years
of
this
determination
he
sold
out
the
name
good
will
and
other
vestiges
of
his
concern
to
a
mysterious
buyer
who
turned
out
to
be
no
more
than
an
agent
for
these
persistently
expanding
varnish
makers
and
he
retired
with
a
genuine
grievance
upon
the
family
accumulations
chiefly
in
consols
and
home
railways
he
refused
however
to
regard
his
defeat
as
final
put
great
faith
in
the
approaching
exhaustion
of
the
petrol
supply
and
talked
in
a
manner
that
should
have
made
the
automobile
association
uneasy
of
devoting
the
rest
of
his
days
to
the
purification
of
england
from
these
aggressive
mechanisms
it
was
a
mistake
he
said
to
let
them
in
he
became
more
frequent
at
his
excellent
west
end
club
and
directed
a
certain
portion
of
his
capital
to
largely
indecisive
but
on
the
whole
unprofitable
speculations
in
south
african
and
south
american
enterprises
he
mingled
a
little
in
affairs
he
was
a
tough
conventional
speaker
rich
in
established
phrases
and
never
abashed
by
hearing
himself
say
commonplace
things
and
in
addition
to
his
campaign
against
automobiles
he
found
time
to
engage
also
in
activities
taking
chairs
saying
a
few
words
and
so
on
cherishing
a
fluctuating
hope
that
his
eloquence
might
ultimately
win
him
an
invitation
to
contest
a
constituency
in
the
interests
of
reaction
and
the
sounder
elements
in
the
liberal
party
he
had
a
side
and
he
was
particularly
attracted
by
that
mass
of
modern
legislative
proposals
which
aims
at
a
more
systematic
control
of
the
lives
of
lower
class
persons
for
their
own
good
by
their
betters
indeed
in
the
first
enthusiasm
of
his
proprietorship
of
the
pope
works
at
east
purblow
he
had
organized
one
of
those
benevolent
industrial
experiments
that
are
now
so
common
he
felt
strongly
against
the
drink
evil
that
is
to
say
the
unrestricted
liberty
of
common
people
to
drink
what
they
prefer
and
he
was
acutely
impressed
by
the
fact
that
families
do
not
spend
their
money
in
the
way
that
seems
most
desirable
to
upper
critics
accordingly
he
did
his
best
to
replace
the
dangerous
freedoms
of
money
by
that
ideal
of
the
social
reformer
payment
in
kind
to
use
his
invariable
phrase
the
east
purblow
experiment
did
no
mean
service
to
the
cause
of
social
reform
unhappily
it
came
to
an
end
through
a
prosecution
under
the
truck
act
that
blot
upon
the
statute
book
designed
it
would
appear
even
deliberately
to
vitiate
man
benevolent
control
of
his
fellow
man
the
lessons
to
be
drawn
from
that
experience
however
grew
if
anything
with
the
years
he
rarely
spoke
without
an
allusion
to
it
and
it
was
quite
remarkable
how
readily
it
could
be
adapted
to
illuminate
a
hundred
different
issues
in
the
hospitable
columns
of
the
at
seven
marjorie
found
herself
upstairs
changing
into
her
frock
she
had
had
a
good
refreshing
wash
in
cold
soft
water
and
it
was
pleasant
to
change
into
thinner
silk
stockings
and
dainty
satin
slippers
and
let
down
and
at
last
brush
her
hair
and
dress
loiteringly
after
the
fatigues
of
her
journey
and
the
activities
of
her
arrival
she
looked
out
on
the
big
church
and
the
big
trees
behind
it
against
the
golden
quiet
of
a
summer
evening
with
extreme
approval
i
suppose
those
birds
are
rooks
she
said
but
daffy
had
gone
to
see
that
the
had
done
themselves
justice
in
their
muslin
frocks
and
pink
sashes
they
were
apt
to
be
a
little
sketchy
with
their
less
accessible
buttons
marjorie
became
aware
of
two
gentlemen
with
her
mother
on
the
lawn
below
one
was
her
almost
affianced
lover
will
magnet
the
humorous
writer
she
had
been
doing
her
best
not
to
think
about
him
all
day
but
now
he
became
an
unavoidable
central
fact
she
regarded
him
with
an
almost
perplexed
scrutiny
and
wondered
vividly
why
she
had
been
so
excited
and
pleased
by
his
attentions
during
the
previous
summer
mr
magnet
was
one
of
those
quiet
deliberately
unassuming
people
who
do
not
even
attempt
to
be
beautiful
not
for
him
was
it
to
pretend
but
to
prick
the
bladder
of
pretence
he
was
a
fairish
man
of
forty
pale
with
a
large
protuberant
observant
grey
eye
i
speak
particularly
of
the
left
and
a
face
of
quiet
animation
warily
alert
for
the
opportunity
his
nose
and
chin
were
pointed
and
his
lips
thin
and
quaintly
pressed
together
he
was
dressed
in
grey
with
a
silken
shirt
showing
a
thin
neck
and
a
flowing
black
tie
and
he
carried
a
grey
felt
hat
in
his
joined
hands
behind
his
back
she
could
hear
the
insinuating
cadences
of
his
voice
as
he
talked
in
her
ear
the
other
gentleman
silent
on
her
mother
right
must
she
knew
be
wintersloan
whom
mr
magnet
had
proposed
to
bring
over
his
dress
betrayed
that
modest
gaiety
of
disposition
becoming
in
an
artist
and
indeed
he
was
one
of
mr
magnet
favourite
illustrators
he
was
in
a
dark
suit
a
black
tie
that
was
quite
unusually
broad
went
twice
around
his
neck
before
succumbing
to
the
bow
and
his
waistcoat
appeared
to
be
of
some
orange
silk
marjorie
eyes
returned
to
mr
magnet
hitherto
she
had
never
had
an
opportunity
of
remarking
that
his
hair
was
more
than
a
little
attenuated
towards
the
crown
it
was
funny
how
his
tie
came
out
under
his
chin
to
the
right
what
an
odd
thing
men
dress
had
become
she
thought
why
did
they
wear
those
ridiculous
collars
and
ties
why
did
they
always
dress
in
flannels
and
look
as
fine
and
slender
and
active
as
the
elder
carmel
boy
for
example
mr
magnet
could
be
such
an
man
why
every
one
dress
to
be
just
as
beautiful
and
splendid
as
possible
instead
of
wearing
queer
things
coming
down
said
daffy
a
vision
of
appearing
in
the
doorway
let
go
first
said
marjorie
with
a
finer
sense
of
effect
and
theodore
we
do
want
to
make
part
of
a
comic
entry
with
theodore
daffy
accordingly
the
two
sisters
watched
discreetly
they
had
to
be
wary
on
account
of
mr
magnet
increasingly
frequent
glances
at
the
windows
and
when
at
last
all
the
rest
of
the
family
had
appeared
below
they
decided
their
cue
had
come
pope
strolled
into
the
group
with
no
trace
of
his
recent
debacle
except
a
slight
limp
he
was
wearing
a
jacket
of
velvet
which
he
affected
in
the
country
and
all
traces
of
his
grand
dudgeon
were
gone
but
then
he
rarely
had
grand
dudgeon
except
in
the
sanctities
of
family
life
and
hardly
ever
when
any
other
man
was
about
well
his
daughters
heard
him
say
with
a
witty
allusiveness
that
was
difficult
to
follow
so
the
magnet
has
come
to
the
mountain
again
eh
come
on
madge
said
daffy
and
the
two
sisters
emerged
harmoniously
together
from
the
house
it
would
have
been
manifest
to
a
meaner
capacity
than
any
present
that
evening
that
mr
magnet
regarded
marjorie
with
a
distinguished
significance
he
had
two
eyes
but
he
had
that
mysterious
quality
so
frequently
associated
with
a
iris
which
gives
the
effect
of
looking
hard
with
one
large
orb
a
sort
of
grey
searchlight
effect
and
he
used
this
eye
ray
now
to
convey
a
respectful
but
firm
admiration
in
the
most
unequivocal
manner
he
saluted
daffy
courteously
and
then
allowed
himself
to
retain
marjorie
hand
for
just
a
second
longer
than
was
necessary
as
he
said
very
simply
i
am
very
pleased
indeed
to
meet
you
again
very
a
slight
embarrassment
fell
between
them
you
are
staying
near
here
mr
magnet
at
the
inn
said
mr
magnet
and
then
i
chose
it
because
it
would
be
near
you
his
eye
pressed
upon
her
again
for
a
moment
is
it
comfortable
said
marjorie
so
charmingly
simple
said
mr
magnet
i
love
it
a
tinkling
bell
announced
the
preparedness
of
supper
and
roused
the
others
to
the
consciousness
that
they
were
silently
watching
mr
magnet
and
marjorie
it
quite
a
simple
farmhouse
supper
said
pope
there
were
ducks
green
peas
and
adolescent
new
potatoes
for
supper
and
afterwards
stewed
fruit
and
cream
and
junket
and
cheese
bottled
beer
gilbey
burgundy
and
lemonade
pope
carved
because
pope
splashed
too
much
and
bones
upset
him
and
made
him
want
to
show
up
chicken
in
the
so
he
sat
at
the
other
end
and
rallied
his
guests
while
pope
distributed
the
viands
he
showed
not
a
trace
of
his
recent
umbrage
theodore
sat
between
daffy
and
his
mother
because
of
his
table
manners
and
marjorie
was
on
her
father
right
hand
and
next
to
wintersloan
while
mr
magnet
was
in
the
middle
of
the
table
on
the
opposite
side
in
a
position
convenient
for
looking
at
her
both
maids
waited
the
presence
of
magnet
invariably
stirred
the
latent
humorist
in
pope
he
felt
that
he
who
talks
to
humorists
should
himself
be
humorous
and
it
was
his
private
persuasion
that
with
more
attention
he
might
have
been
to
use
a
favourite
form
of
expression
no
mean
jester
quite
a
lot
of
little
things
of
his
were
cherished
as
good
both
by
himself
and
with
occasional
inaccuracies
by
pope
he
opened
out
now
in
a
strain
of
rich
allusiveness
what
will
you
drink
mr
wintersloan
he
said
wine
of
the
country
yclept
beer
red
wine
from
france
or
my
wife
potent
brew
from
the
golden
lemon
wintersloan
thought
he
would
take
burgundy
mr
magnet
preferred
beer
i
heard
there
iron
in
the
beer
and
i
believe
it
misquoted
pope
and
nodded
as
it
were
to
the
marker
to
score
daffy
and
marjorie
are
still
in
the
lemonade
stage
will
you
take
a
little
burgundy
mummy
pope
decided
she
would
and
was
inspired
to
ask
wintersloan
if
he
had
been
in
that
part
of
the
country
before
topography
ensued
wintersloan
had
a
style
of
his
own
and
spoke
of
the
buryhamstreet
district
as
a
pooty
little
country
pooty
little
hills
with
a
swirl
in
them
this
pleased
daffy
and
marjorie
and
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
then
mr
magnet
with
a
ray
full
on
marjorie
said
he
had
always
been
fond
of
surrey
i
think
if
ever
i
made
a
home
in
the
country
i
should
like
it
to
be
here
wintersloan
said
surrey
would
tire
him
it
was
too
bossy
and
curly
too
flocculent
he
would
prefer
to
look
on
broader
simpler
lines
with
just
a
sudden
catch
in
the
breath
in
them
if
you
understand
me
marjorie
did
and
said
so
a
sob
such
as
you
get
at
the
break
of
a
pinewood
on
a
hill
this
baffled
pope
but
marjorie
took
it
or
the
short
dry
cough
of
a
cliff
she
said
exactly
said
wintersloan
and
having
turned
a
little
deliberate
smile
on
her
for
a
moment
resumed
his
wing
so
long
as
a
landscape
does
said
mr
magnet
in
that
irresistible
dry
way
of
his
and
rom
and
sydney
at
any
rate
choked
now
is
the
hour
when
landscapes
yawn
mused
pope
coming
in
all
right
at
the
end
then
pope
asked
wintersloan
about
his
route
to
buryhamstreet
and
then
pope
asked
mr
magnet
whether
he
was
playing
at
a
new
work
or
working
at
a
new
play
mr
magnet
said
he
was
dreaming
over
a
play
he
wanted
to
bring
out
the
more
serious
side
of
his
humour
go
a
little
deeper
into
things
than
he
had
hitherto
done
mingling
smiles
and
tears
said
pope
approvingly
mr
magnet
said
very
quietly
that
all
true
humour
did
that
then
pope
asked
what
the
play
was
to
be
about
and
mr
magnet
who
seemed
disinclined
to
give
an
answer
turned
the
subject
by
saying
he
had
to
prepare
an
address
on
humour
for
the
next
dinner
of
the
it
to
be
a
humourist
dinner
and
they
made
me
the
guest
of
the
evening
by
way
of
a
joke
to
begin
with
he
said
with
that
dry
smile
again
pope
said
he
should
say
things
like
that
she
then
said
syd
quietly
but
sharply
to
sydney
who
was
making
a
disdainful
squinting
face
at
theodore
and
told
the
parlourmaid
to
clear
the
plates
for
sweets
mr
magnet
professed
great
horror
of
public
speaking
he
said
that
whenever
he
rose
to
make
an
speech
all
the
ices
he
had
ever
eaten
seemed
to
come
out
of
the
past
and
sit
on
his
backbone
the
talk
centered
for
awhile
on
mr
magnet
address
and
apropos
of
tests
of
humour
pope
who
in
his
way
was
no
mean
raconteur
related
the
story
of
the
man
who
took
the
salad
dressing
with
his
hand
and
when
his
host
asked
why
he
did
that
replied
oh
i
thought
it
was
spinach
many
people
added
pope
would
see
the
point
of
that
and
if
they
do
see
the
point
they
ca
and
the
more
they
try
the
less
they
do
all
four
girls
hoped
secretly
and
not
too
confidently
that
their
laughter
had
not
sounded
hollow
and
then
for
a
time
the
men
told
stories
as
they
came
into
their
heads
in
an
easy
irresponsible
way
mr
magnet
spoke
of
the
humour
of
the
who
always
dangled
and
twiddled
his
badge
by
way
of
a
joke
when
he
passed
the
conductor
whose
father
had
been
hanged
and
pope
perhaps
a
little
irrelevantly
told
the
story
of
the
little
boy
who
was
asked
his
father
last
words
and
said
mother
was
with
him
to
the
end
which
particularly
amused
pope
wintersloan
gave
the
story
of
the
woman
who
was
taking
her
son
to
the
hospital
with
his
head
jammed
into
a
saucepan
and
explained
to
the
other
people
in
the
omnibus
you
see
what
makes
it
so
annoying
it
me
only
saucepan
then
they
came
back
to
the
sense
of
humour
with
the
dentist
who
shouted
with
laughter
and
when
asked
the
reason
by
his
patient
choked
out
wrong
tooth
and
then
pope
reminded
them
of
the
heartless
husband
who
suddenly
informed
that
his
was
dead
exclaimed
oh
do
make
me
laugh
please
i
got
a
split
lip
the
conversation
assumed
a
less
anecdotal
quality
with
the
removal
to
the
on
mr
magnet
initiative
the
gentlemen
followed
the
ladies
almost
immediately
and
it
was
mr
magnet
who
remembered
that
marjorie
could
sing
both
the
elder
sisters
indeed
had
sweet
clear
voices
and
they
had
learnt
a
number
of
those
jolly
songs
the
english
made
before
the
dull
hanoverians
came
syd
accompanied
and
rom
sat
back
in
the
low
chair
in
the
corner
and
fell
deeply
in
love
with
wintersloan
the
three
musicians
in
their
green
and
and
white
made
a
pretty
group
in
the
light
of
the
shaded
lamp
against
the
black
and
gold
broadwood
the
tawdry
screen
its
pattern
thin
glittering
upon
darkness
and
the
deep
shadows
behind
marjorie
loved
singing
and
forgot
herself
as
she
sang
i
love
and
he
loves
me
again
yet
dare
i
not
tell
who
for
if
the
nymphs
should
know
my
swain
i
fear
they
love
him
too
she
sang
and
mr
magnet
could
not
conceal
the
intensity
of
his
admiration
pope
had
fallen
into
a
pleasant
musing
several
other
ripe
old
yarns
dear
delicious
old
things
had
come
into
his
mind
that
he
felt
he
might
presently
recall
when
this
unavoidable
display
of
accomplishments
was
overpast
and
it
was
with
one
of
them
almost
on
his
lips
that
he
glanced
across
at
his
guest
he
was
surprised
to
see
mr
magnet
face
transfigured
he
was
sitting
forward
looking
up
at
marjorie
and
he
had
caught
something
of
the
expression
of
those
blessed
boys
who
froth
at
the
feet
of
an
assumption
for
an
instant
pope
did
not
understand
then
he
understood
it
was
marjorie
he
had
a
twinge
of
surprise
and
glanced
at
his
own
daughter
as
though
he
had
never
seen
her
before
he
perceived
in
a
flash
for
the
first
time
that
this
troublesome
clever
disrespectful
child
was
tall
and
shapely
and
sweet
and
indeed
quite
a
beautiful
young
woman
he
forgot
his
anecdotes
his
being
was
suffused
with
pride
and
responsibility
and
the
sense
of
virtue
rewarded
he
did
not
reflect
for
a
moment
that
marjorie
embodied
in
almost
equal
proportions
the
very
best
points
in
his
mother
and
his
and
avoided
his
own
more
salient
characteristics
with
so
neat
a
dexterity
that
from
top
to
toe
except
for
the
one
matter
of
colour
not
only
did
she
not
resemble
him
but
she
scarcely
even
alluded
to
him
he
thought
simply
that
she
was
his
daughter
that
she
derived
from
him
that
her
beauty
was
his
she
was
the
outcome
of
his
meritorious
preparations
he
recalled
all
the
moments
when
he
had
been
kind
and
indulgent
to
her
all
the
bills
he
had
paid
for
her
all
the
stresses
and
trials
of
the
collapse
all
the
fluctuations
of
his
speculative
adventures
became
things
he
had
faced
patiently
and
valiantly
for
her
sake
he
forgot
the
endless
times
when
he
had
been
viciously
cross
with
her
all
the
times
when
he
had
pished
and
tushed
and
sworn
in
her
hearing
he
had
on
provocation
and
in
spite
of
her
mother
protests
slapped
her
pretty
vigorously
but
such
things
are
better
forgotten
nor
did
he
recall
how
bitterly
he
had
opposed
the
college
education
which
had
made
her
now
so
clear
in
eye
and
thought
nor
the
frightful
shindy
only
three
months
since
about
that
identical
green
dress
in
which
she
now
stood
delightful
he
forgot
these
petty
details
as
an
idealist
should
there
she
was
his
daughter
an
immense
benevolence
irradiated
his
soul
for
marjorie
for
magnet
his
eyes
were
suffused
with
a
not
ignoble
tenderness
the
man
he
knew
was
worth
at
least
thousand
pounds
a
discussion
of
investments
had
made
that
clear
and
he
must
be
making
at
least
five
thousand
a
year
a
beautiful
girl
a
worthy
man
a
good
fellow
a
sound
good
fellow
a
careful
fellow
too
as
these
fellows
went
old
daddy
would
lose
his
treasure
of
course
well
a
father
must
learn
resignation
and
he
for
one
would
not
stand
in
the
way
of
his
girl
happiness
a
day
would
come
when
very
beautifully
and
tenderly
he
would
hand
her
over
to
magnet
his
favourite
daughter
to
his
trusted
friend
well
my
boy
there
no
one
in
all
the
world
he
would
begin
it
would
be
a
touching
parting
do
forget
your
old
father
maggots
he
would
say
at
such
a
moment
that
quaint
nickname
would
surely
not
be
resented
he
reflected
how
much
he
had
always
preferred
marjorie
to
daffy
she
was
brighter
more
like
him
daffy
was
unresponsive
with
a
touch
of
bitterness
under
her
tongue
he
was
already
dreaming
he
was
a
widower
rather
infirm
the
object
of
magnet
and
marjorie
devoted
care
when
the
song
ceased
and
the
wife
he
had
for
the
purpose
of
reveries
just
consigned
so
carelessly
to
the
cemetery
proposed
that
they
should
have
a
little
game
that
every
one
could
play
at
a
number
of
pencils
and
slips
of
paper
appeared
in
her
hands
she
did
not
want
the
girls
to
exhaust
their
repertory
on
this
first
occasion
and
besides
pope
liked
games
in
which
one
did
things
with
pencils
and
strips
of
paper
mr
magnet
wished
the
singing
to
go
on
he
said
but
he
was
overruled
so
for
a
time
every
one
played
a
little
game
in
which
pope
was
particularly
proficient
indeed
it
was
rare
that
any
one
won
but
pope
it
was
called
the
great
departed
and
it
had
such
considerable
educational
value
that
all
the
children
had
to
play
at
it
whenever
he
wished
it
was
played
in
this
manner
one
of
the
pseudo
twins
opened
a
book
and
dabbed
a
finger
on
the
page
and
read
out
the
letter
immediately
at
the
tip
of
her
finger
then
all
of
them
began
to
write
as
hard
as
they
could
writing
down
the
names
of
every
great
person
they
could
think
of
whose
name
began
with
that
letter
at
the
end
of
five
minutes
pope
said
stop
and
then
began
to
read
his
list
out
beginning
with
the
first
name
everybody
who
had
that
name
crossed
it
out
and
scored
one
and
after
his
list
was
exhausted
all
the
surviving
names
on
the
next
list
were
read
over
in
the
same
way
and
so
on
the
names
had
to
be
the
names
of
dead
celebrated
people
only
one
monarch
of
the
same
name
of
the
same
dynasty
was
allowed
and
pope
adjudicated
on
all
doubtful
cases
it
was
great
fun
the
first
two
games
were
won
as
usual
by
pope
and
then
wintersloan
who
had
been
a
little
distraught
in
his
manner
brightened
up
and
scribbled
furiously
the
letter
was
and
after
pope
had
rehearsed
a
tale
of
nine
and
twenty
names
wintersloan
read
out
his
list
in
that
curious
voice
of
his
which
suggested
nothing
so
much
as
some
mobile
drink
glucking
out
of
the
neck
of
a
bottle
held
upside
down
dahl
he
began

was
invincible
and
he
proceeded
in
the
end
he
emerged
triumphant
with
names
mostly
painters
for
whose
fame
he
answered
but
whose
reputations
were
certainly
new

every

i

that
said

with

turned
that
hard

full
on
marjorie

to
do
it
at
first
i
just
cast
about

i

a
frightful

no

try
again
marjorie
glanced
at
her
father
wintersloan
methods
were
all
too
evident
to
her
a
curious
feeling
pervaded
the
room
that
pope
think
wintersloan
conduct
honourable
and
that
he
might
even
go
some
way
towards
saying
so
so
pope
became
very
brisk
and
stirring
and
said
she
thought
that
now
perhaps
a
charade
would
be
more
amusing
it
did
do
to
keep
on
at
a
game
too
long
she
asked
rom
and
daphne
and
theodore
and
wintersloan
to
go
out
and
they
all
agreed
readily
particularly
rom
come
on
said
rom
to
wintersloan
everybody
else
shifted
into
an
group
between
the
piano
and
the
mr
magnet
sat
at
marjorie
feet
while
syd
played
a
kind
of
voluntary
and
pope
leant
back
in
his
chair
with
his
brows
knit
and
lips
moving
trying
to
remember
something
the
charade
very
amusing
the
word
was
catarrh
and
wintersloan
as
the
patient
in
the
last
act
being
given
gruel
surpassed
even
the
children
very
high
expectations
rom
as
his
nurse
keep
her
hands
off
him
then
the
younger
people
kissed
round
and
were
packed
off
to
bed
and
the
rest
of
the
party
went
to
the
door
upon
the
lawn
and
admired
the
night
it
was
a
glorious
summer
night
deep
blue
and
rimmed
warmly
by
the
afterglow
moonless
and
with
a
few
big
stars
above
the
black
still
shapes
of
trees
pope
said
they
would
all
accompany
their
guests
to
the
gate
at
the
end
of
the
avenue
in
spite
of
the
cockchafers
pope
ankle
however
excused
him
the
cordiality
of
his
parting
from
wintersloan
seemed
a
trifle
forced
and
he
limped
thoughtfully
and
a
little
sombrely
towards
the
study
to
see
if
he
could
find
an
encyclopædia
or
some
such
book
of
reference
that
would
give
the
names
of
the
lesser
lights
of
dutch
italian
and
english
painting
during
the
last
two
centuries
he
felt
that
wintersloan
had
established
an
extraordinarily
bad
precedent
marjorie
discovered
that
she
and
mr
magnet
had
fallen
a
little
behind
the
others
she
would
have
quickened
her
pace
but
mr
magnet
stopped
short
and
said
marjorie
when
i
saw
you
standing
there
and
singing
said
mr
magnet
and
was
short
of
breath
for
a
moment
marjorie
natural
gift
for
interruption
failed
her
altogether
i
felt
i
would
rather
be
able
to
call
you
mine
than
win
an
empire
the
pause
seemed
to
lengthen
between
them
and
marjorie
remark
when
she
made
it
at
last
struck
her
even
as
she
made
it
as
being
but
poorly
conceived
she
had
some
weak
idea
of
being
i
think
you
had
better
win
an
empire
mr
magnet
she
said
meekly
then
before
anything
more
was
possible
they
had
come
up
to
daffy
and
wintersloan
and
her
mother
at
the
gate
as
they
returned
pope
was
loud
in
the
praises
of
will
magnet
she
had
a
little
voice
very
carefully
and
very
skilfully
controlled
and
she
dilated
on
his
modesty
his
quiet
helpfulness
at
table
his
ready
presence
of
mind
she
pointed
out
instances
of
those
admirable
traits
incidents
small
in
themselves
but
charming
in
their
implications
when
somebody
wanted
junket
he
had
made
no
fuss
he
had
just
helped
them
to
junket
so
modest
and
unassuming
sang
pope
you
never
dream
he
was
quite
rich
and
famous
yet
every
book
he
writes
is
translated
into
russian
and
german
and
all
sorts
of
languages
i
suppose
he
almost
the
greatest
humorist
we
have
that
play
of
his
what
is
it
called
owd
has
been
performed
nearly
twelve
hundred
times
i
think
that
is
the
most
wonderful
of
gifts
think
of
the
people
it
has
made
happy
the
conversation
was
mainly
monologue
both
marjorie
and
daffy
were
unusually
thoughtful
marjorie
ended
the
long
day
in
a
worldly
mood
penny
for
your
thoughts
said
daffy
abruptly
brushing
the
long
firelit
rapids
of
her
hair
not
for
sale
said
marjorie
and
roused
herself
i
had
a
long
day
it
always
just
the
time
i
particularly
wish
i
was
a
man
she
remarked
after
a
brief
return
to
meditation
fancy
no
no
brushing
no
to
get
lost
about
no
strings
i
suppose
they
have
strings
they
have
said
daffy
with
conviction
she
met
marjorie
interrogative
eye
father
would
swear
at
them
she
explained
he
naturally
tie
himself
up
and
we
should
hear
of
it
i
did
think
of
that
said
marjorie
and
stuck
out
her
chin
upon
her
fists
sound
induction
she
forgot
this
transitory
curiosity
suppose
one
had
a
maid
daffy
a
real
maid
a
maid
who
mended
your
things
did
your
hair
while
you
read
oh
here
goes
and
she
stood
up
and
grappled
with
the
task
of
undressing
chapter
the
second
the
two
proposals
of
mr
magnet
it
was
presently
quite
evident
to
marjorie
that
mr
magnet
intended
to
propose
marriage
to
her
and
she
did
not
even
know
whether
she
wanted
him
to
do
so
she
had
met
him
first
the
previous
summer
while
she
had
been
staying
with
the
at
high
windower
and
it
had
been
evident
that
he
found
her
extremely
attractive
she
had
never
had
a
real
grown
man
at
her
feet
before
and
she
had
found
it
amazingly
entertaining
she
had
gone
for
a
walk
with
him
the
morning
before
she
came
away
a
frank
and
ingenuous
proceeding
that
made
say
the
girl
knew
what
she
was
about
and
she
had
certainly
coquetted
with
him
in
an
extraordinary
manner
at
after
that
oxbridge
had
swallowed
her
up
and
though
he
had
called
once
on
her
mother
while
marjorie
was
in
london
during
the
christmas
vacation
he
had
seen
her
again
he
had
written
which
was
exciting
a
long
friendly
humorous
letter
about
nothing
in
particular
with
an
air
of
its
being
quite
the
correct
thing
for
him
to
do
and
she
had
answered
and
there
had
been
other
exchanges
but
all
sorts
of
things
had
happened
in
the
interval
and
marjorie
had
let
him
get
into
quite
a
back
place
in
her
thoughts
the
fact
that
he
was
a
member
of
her
father
club
had
seemed
somehow
to
remove
him
from
a
great
range
of
possibilities
until
a
drift
in
her
mother
talk
towards
him
and
a
letter
from
him
with
an
indefinable
change
in
tone
towards
intimacy
had
restored
him
to
importance
now
here
he
was
in
the
foreground
of
her
world
again
evidently
more
ardent
than
ever
and
with
a
portentous
air
of
being
about
to
do
something
decisive
at
the
very
first
opportunity
what
was
he
going
to
do
what
had
her
mother
been
hinting
at
and
what
in
fact
did
the
whole
thing
amount
to
marjorie
was
beginning
to
realize
that
this
was
going
to
be
a
very
serious
affair
indeed
for
her
and
that
she
was
totally
unprepared
to
meet
it
it
had
been
very
amusing
very
amusing
indeed
at
the
but
there
were
moments
now
when
she
felt
towards
mr
magnet
exactly
as
she
would
have
felt
if
he
had
been
one
of
the
oxbridge
tradesmen
hovering
about
her
with
a
little
account
full
of
apparently
exaggerated
items
her
thoughts
and
feelings
were
all
in
confusion
about
this
business
her
mind
was
full
of
scraps
every
sort
of
idea
every
sort
of
attitude
contributed
something
to
that
twentieth
century
jumble
for
example
and
so
far
as
its
value
went
among
motives
it
was
by
no
means
a
trivial
consideration
she
wanted
a
proposal
for
its
own
sake
daffy
had
had
a
proposal
last
year
and
although
it
was
any
sort
of
eligible
proposal
still
there
it
was
and
she
had
given
herself
tremendous
airs
but
marjorie
would
certainly
have
preferred
some
lighter
kind
of
proposal
than
that
which
now
threatened
her
she
felt
that
behind
mr
magnet
were
sanctions
that
she
was
free
to
deal
with
this
proposal
as
she
liked
he
was
at
buryhamstreet
almost
with
the
air
of
being
her
parents
guest
less
clear
and
more
instinctive
than
her
desire
for
a
proposal
was
her
inclination
to
see
just
all
that
mr
magnet
was
disposed
to
do
and
hear
all
that
he
was
disposed
to
say
she
was
curious
he
did
behave
in
the
least
as
she
had
expected
a
lover
to
behave
but
then
none
of
the
boys
the
others
with
whom
she
had
at
times
stretched
a
hand
towards
the
hem
of
emotion
had
ever
done
that
she
had
an
obscure
feeling
that
perhaps
presently
mr
magnet
must
light
up
be
stirred
and
stirring
even
now
his
voice
changed
very
interestingly
when
he
was
alone
with
her
his
breath
seemed
to
go
as
though
something
had
pricked
his
lung
if
it
had
been
for
that
new
disconcerting
realization
of
an
official
pressure
behind
him
i
think
she
would
have
been
quite
ready
to
experiment
extensively
with
his
emotions
but
she
perceived
as
she
lay
awake
next
morning
that
she
was
free
for
experiments
any
longer
what
she
might
say
or
do
now
would
be
taken
up
very
conclusively
and
she
had
no
idea
what
she
wanted
to
say
or
do
marriage
regarded
in
the
abstract
that
is
to
say
with
mr
magnet
out
of
focus
was
by
no
means
an
unattractive
proposal
to
her
it
was
very
much
at
the
back
of
marjorie
mind
that
after
oxbridge
unless
she
was
prepared
to
face
a
very
serious
row
indeed
and
go
to
teach
in
a
school
and
she
did
feel
any
call
whatever
to
teach
in
a
school
she
would
probably
have
to
return
to
hartstone
square
and
share
daffy
room
again
and
assist
in
the
old
collective
wearisome
task
of
propitiating
her
father
the
freedoms
of
oxbridge
had
enlarged
her
imagination
until
that
seemed
an
almost
unendurably
irksome
prospect
she
had
tasted
life
as
it
could
be
in
her
father
absence
and
she
was
beginning
to
realize
just
what
an
impossible
person
he
was
marriage
was
escape
from
all
that
it
meant
not
only
respectful
parents
but
a
house
of
her
very
own
furniture
of
her
choice
great
freedom
of
movement
an
authority
an
importance
she
had
seen
what
it
meant
to
be
a
prosperously
married
young
woman
in
the
person
of
one
or
two
resplendent
old
girls
revisiting
bennett
college
scattering
invitations
offering
protections
and
opportunities
of
course
there
is
love
marjorie
told
herself
as
she
had
been
trained
to
tell
herself
to
be
sensible
but
something
within
her
repeated
is
of
course
she
liked
mr
magnet
she
really
did
like
mr
magnet
very
much
she
had
had
her
girlish
dreams
had
fallen
in
love
with
pictures
of
men
and
actors
and
a
music
master
and
a
man
who
used
to
ride
by
as
she
went
to
school
but
was
this
desolating
desire
for
rather
silly
something
that
one
left
behind
with
much
else
when
it
came
to
putting
up
one
hair
and
sensible
living
something
to
blush
secretly
about
and
hide
from
every
eye
among
other
discrepant
views
that
lived
together
in
her
mind
as
cats
and
rats
and
parrots
and
squirrels
and
so
forth
used
to
live
together
in
those
happy
family
cages
unseemly
men
in
less
days
were
wont
to
steer
about
our
streets
was
one
instilled
by
quite
a
large
proportion
of
the
novels
she
had
read
that
a
girl
was
a
sort
of
prize
for
high
moral
worth
mr
magnet
she
knew
was
good
was
kind
was
brave
with
that
truer
courage
moral
courage
which
goes
with
his
type
of
physique
he
was
modest
unassuming
well
off
and
famous
and
very
much
in
love
with
her
his
true
self
as
pope
had
pointed
out
several
times
must
be
really
very
beautiful
and
in
some
odd
way
a
line
of
shakespeare
had
washed
up
in
her
consciousness
as
being
somehow
effectual
on
his
behalf
love
looks
not
with
the
eye
but
with
the
mind
she
felt
she
ought
to
look
with
the
mind
nice
people
surely
never
looked
in
any
other
way
it
seemed
from
this
angle
almost
her
duty
to
love
him
perhaps
she
did
love
him
and
mistook
the
symptoms
she
did
her
best
to
mistake
the
symptoms
but
if
she
did
truly
love
him
would
it
seem
so
queer
and
important
and
antagonistic
as
it
did
that
his
hair
was
rather
thin
upon
the
crown
of
his
head
she
wished
she
had
looked
down
on
him
poor
marjorie
she
was
doing
her
best
to
be
sensible
and
she
felt
herself
adrift
above
a
clamorous
abyss
of
feared
and
forbidden
thoughts
down
there
she
knew
well
enough
it
was
thus
that
love
must
come
deep
in
her
soul
the
richest
thing
in
her
life
indeed
and
the
best
thing
she
had
to
give
humanity
was
a
craving
for
beauty
that
at
times
became
almost
intolerable
a
craving
for
something
other
than
beauty
and
yet
inseparably
allied
with
it
a
craving
for
deep
excitement
for
a
sort
of
glory
in
adventure
for
passion
for
things
akin
to
great
music
and
heroic
poems
and
bannered
traditions
of
romance
she
had
hidden
away
in
her
an
immense
tumultuous
appetite
for
life
an
immense
tumultuous
capacity
for
living
to
be
loved
beautifully
was
surely
the
crown
and
climax
of
her
being
she
did
not
dare
to
listen
to
these
deeps
yet
these
insurgent
voices
filled
her
even
while
she
drove
her
little
crocodile
of
primly
sensible
thoughts
to
their
sane
appointed
conclusion
her
blood
and
nerves
and
all
her
being
were
protesting
that
mr
magnet
would
not
do
that
whatever
other
worthiness
was
in
him
regarded
as
a
lover
he
was
preposterous
and
flat
and
foolish
and
and
that
it
were
better
never
to
have
lived
than
to
put
the
treasure
of
her
life
to
his
meagre
lips
and
into
his
hungry
unattractive
arms
the
ugliness
of
it
the
spiritless
horror
of
it
so
dumbly
and
formlessly
the
rebel
voices
urged
one
has
to
be
sensible
said
marjorie
to
herself
suddenly
putting
down
shaw
book
on
municipal
trading
which
she
imagined
she
had
been
reading
perhaps
all
marriage
was
horrid
and
one
had
to
get
over
it
that
was
rather
what
her
mother
had
conveyed
to
her
mr
magnet
made
his
first
proposal
in
form
three
days
later
after
coming
twice
to
tea
and
staying
on
to
supper
he
had
played
croquet
with
pope
he
had
been
beaten
twelve
times
in
spite
of
twinges
in
the
sprained
ankle
heroically
borne
had
had
three
victories
lucidly
explained
away
and
heard
all
the
particulars
of
the
east
purblow
experiment
three
times
over
first
in
relation
to
the
new
labour
exchanges
then
regarded
at
rather
a
different
angle
in
relation
to
female
betting
and
the
sanctities
of
the
home
generally
and
finally
in
a
more
exhaustive
style
to
show
its
full
importance
from
every
side
and
more
particularly
as
demonstrating
the
gross
injustice
done
to
pope
by
the
neglect
of
its
lessons
a
neglect
too
systematic
to
be
accidental
in
the
social
reform
literature
of
the
time
moreover
mr
magnet
had
been
made
to
understand
thoroughly
how
several
later
attempts
of
a
similar
character
had
already
become
or
must
inevitably
become
unsatisfactory
through
their
failure
to
follow
exactly
in
the
lines
laid
down
by
pope
pope
was
really
very
anxious
to
be
pleasant
and
agreeable
to
mr
magnet
and
he
could
think
of
no
surer
way
of
doing
so
than
by
giving
him
an
unrestrained
intimacy
of
conversation
that
prevented
anything
more
than
momentary
intercourse
between
his
daughter
and
her
admirer
and
not
only
did
mr
magnet
find
it
difficult
to
get
away
from
pope
without
offence
but
whenever
by
any
chance
pope
was
detached
for
a
moment
mr
magnet
discovered
that
marjorie
either
was
to
be
seen
or
if
she
was
she
was
to
be
isolated
by
any
device
he
could
contrive
before
the
unappeasable
return
of
pope
mr
magnet
did
not
get
his
chance
therefore
until
lady
little
gathering
at
summerhay
park
lady
petchworth
was
pope
oldest
friend
and
one
of
those
brighter
influences
which
save
our
english
from
lassitude
she
had
been
more
fortunate
than
pope
for
while
pope
with
that
aptitude
for
disadvantage
natural
to
his
temperament
had
he
said
been
tied
to
a
business
that
never
gave
him
a
chance
lady
husband
had
been
a
reckless
investor
of
exceptional
in
particular
led
by
a
dream
he
had
put
most
of
his
money
into
a
series
of
nitrate
deposits
in
caves
in
saghalien
haunted
by
benevolent
penguins
and
had
been
rewarded
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
his
foresight
had
received
the
fitting
reward
of
a
knighthood
and
sir
thomas
after
restoring
the
parish
church
at
summerhay
in
a
costly
and
destructive
manner
spent
his
declining
years
in
an
enviable
contentment
with
lady
petchworth
and
the
world
at
large
and
died
long
before
infirmity
made
him
really
troublesome
good
fortune
had
brought
out
lady
petchworth
social
aptitudes
summerhay
park
was
everything
that
a
clever
woman
inspired
by
that
gardening
literature
which
has
been
so
abundant
in
the
opening
years
of
the
twentieth
century
could
make
it
it
had
rosaries
and
rock
gardens
sundials
and
yew
hedges
pools
and
ponds
lead
figures
and
stone
urns
box
borderings
and
wilderness
corners
and
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
feet
of
wall
with
broad
herbaceous
borders
the
walks
had
primroses
primulas
and
cowslips
in
a
quite
disingenuous
abundance
and
in
spring
the
whole
extent
of
the
park
was
gay
here
with
thousands
of
this
sort
of
daffodil
just
bursting
out
and
here
with
thousands
of
that
sort
of
narcissus
just
past
its
prime
and
every
patch
ready
to
pass
itself
off
in
its
naturalized
way
as
the
accidental
native
flower
of
the
field
if
only
it
had
been
for
all
the
other
different
varieties
coming
on
or
in
adjacent
patches
her
garden
was
only
the
beginning
of
lady
petchworth
activities
she
had
a
model
dairy
and
all
her
poultry
was
white
and
so
far
as
she
was
able
to
manage
it
she
made
summerhay
a
model
village
she
overflowed
with
activities
it
was
astonishing
in
one
so
plump
and
blonde
and
meeting
followed
meeting
in
the
artistic
little
and
timber
village
hall
she
had
erected
now
it
was
the
national
theatre
and
now
it
was
the
national
mourning
now
it
was
the
break
up
of
the
poor
law
and
now
the
majority
report
now
the
union
and
now
socialism
and
now
individualism
but
always
something
progressive
and
beneficial
she
did
her
best
to
revive
the
old
village
life
and
brought
her
very
considerable
powers
of
compulsion
to
make
the
men
dance
in
simple
old
morris
dances
dressed
up
in
costumes
they
secretly
abominated
and
to
induce
the
mothers
to
dress
their
children
in
smocks
instead
of
the
prints
and
blue
serge
frocks
they
preferred
she
did
not
despair
she
said
of
creating
a
spontaneous
peasant
art
movement
in
the
district
springing
from
the
people
and
expressing
the
people
but
so
far
it
had
been
necessary
to
import
not
only
instructors
and
material
but
workers
to
keep
the
thing
going
so
sluggish
had
the
spontaneity
of
our
english
countryside
become
her
little
gatherings
were
quite
distinctive
of
her
they
were
a
sort
of
garden
party
extending
from
to
six
or
seven
there
would
be
a
nucleus
of
house
guests
and
the
highways
and
byeways
on
every
hand
would
be
raided
to
supply
persons
and
interests
she
had
told
her
friend
to
bring
the
girls
over
for
the
day
and
flung
an
invitation
to
pope
who
had
at
once
excused
himself
on
the
score
of
his
ankle
pope
was
one
of
those
men
who
shun
social
gatherings
ostensibly
because
of
a
sterling
simplicity
of
taste
but
really
because
his
intolerable
egotism
made
him
feel
slighted
and
neglected
on
these
occasions
he
told
his
wife
he
would
be
far
happier
with
a
book
at
home
exhorted
her
not
to
be
late
and
was
seen
composing
himself
to
read
the
vicar
of
wakefield
whenever
they
published
a
new
book
pope
pretended
to
read
an
old
one
as
the
hired
waggonette
took
the
rest
of
his
family
theodore
very
unhappy
in
buff
silk
and
a
wide
stuart
collar
down
the
avenue
they
found
a
long
lunch
table
laid
on
the
lawn
beneath
the
chestnuts
and
in
full
view
of
the
poppies
and
around
the
stone
obelisk
a
butler
and
three
men
servants
with
brass
buttons
and
red
and
white
striped
waistcoats
gave
dignity
to
the
scene
and
beyond
on
the
terrace
amidst
abundance
of
deckchairs
cane
chairs
rugs
and
cushions
a
miscellaneous
and
increasing
company
seethed
under
lady
plump
but
entertaining
hand
there
were
of
course
mr
magnet
and
his
friend
wintersloan
lady
petchworth
had
been
given
to
understand
how
the
land
lay
and
there
was
bunford
paradise
the
musician
who
was
doing
his
best
to
teach
a
sullen
holiday
class
in
the
village
schoolroom
to
sing
the
artless
old
folk
songs
of
surrey
again
in
spite
of
the
invincible
persuasion
of
everybody
in
the
class
that
the
songs
were
rather
indelicate
and
extremely
silly
there
were
the
rev
jopling
baynes
and
two
cambridge
undergraduates
in
flannels
and
a
doctor
something
or
other
from
london
there
was
also
the
hon
charles
muskett
lord
pottinger
cousin
and
estate
agent
in
tweeds
and
very
helpful
the
ladies
included
raff
the
fashion
writer
in
a
wonderful
costume
the
anonymous
doctor
wife
three
or
four
neighbouring
mothers
with
an
undistinguished
daughter
or
so
and
two
ladies
whose
names
marjorie
could
not
catch
and
whom
lady
petchworth
in
that
voice
of
hers
addressed
as
kate
and
julia
and
seemed
on
the
whole
disposed
to
treat
as
humorous
there
was
also
fraulein
schmidt
in
charge
of
lady
petchworth
three
tall
and
already
abundant
children
prunella
prudence
and
mary
and
a
young
couple
of
cousins
who
addressed
each
other
in
soft
undertones
and
sat
apart
these
were
the
chief
items
that
became
distinctive
in
marjorie
survey
but
there
were
a
number
of
other
people
who
seemed
to
come
and
go
split
up
fuse
change
their
appearance
slightly
and
behave
in
the
way
inadequately
apprehended
people
do
behave
on
these
occasions
marjorie
very
speedily
found
her
disposition
to
take
a
detached
and
amused
view
of
the
entertainment
in
conflict
with
more
urgent
demands
from
the
outset
mr
magnet
loomed
upon
her
he
loomed
nearer
and
nearer
he
turned
his
eye
upon
her
as
she
came
up
to
the
wealthy
expanse
of
lady
petchworth
presence
like
some
sort
of
obsolescent
turning
a
respectful
loving
searchlight
upon
a
fugitive
torpedo
boat
and
thereafter
he
seemed
to
her
to
be
looking
at
her
without
intermission
relentlessly
and
urging
himself
towards
her
she
wished
he
would
she
had
at
all
thought
he
would
on
this
occasion
at
first
she
relied
upon
her
natural
powers
of
evasion
and
the
presence
of
a
large
company
then
gradually
it
became
apparent
that
lady
petchworth
and
her
mother
yes
and
the
party
generally
and
the
gardens
and
the
weather
and
the
stars
in
their
courses
were
of
a
mind
to
in
giving
opportunity
for
mr
magnet
unmistakable
intentions
and
marjorie
with
that
instability
of
her
sex
which
has
been
a
theme
for
masculine
humour
in
all
ages
suddenly
and
with
an
extraordinary
violence
did
want
to
make
up
her
mind
about
mr
magnet
she
want
to
accept
him
and
as
distinctly
she
did
want
to
refuse
him
she
did
even
want
to
be
thought
about
as
making
up
her
mind
about
him
which
was
so
to
speak
an
enlargement
of
her
previous
indisposition
she
did
even
want
to
seem
to
avoid
him
or
to
be
thinking
about
him
or
aware
of
his
existence
after
the
greeting
of
lady
petchworth
she
had
succeeded
very
clumsily
in
not
seeing
mr
magnet
and
had
addressed
herself
to
wintersloan
who
was
standing
a
little
apart
looking
under
his
hand
with
one
eye
shut
at
the
view
between
the
tree
stems
towards
buryhamstreet
he
told
her
that
he
thought
he
had
found
something
pooty
that
had
been
done
and
she
did
her
best
to
share
his
artistic
interests
with
a
vivid
sense
of
mr
magnet
tentative
incessant
approach
behind
her
he
joined
them
and
she
made
a
desperate
attempt
to
entangle
wintersloan
in
a
talk
in
vain
he
turned
away
at
the
first
possible
opportunity
and
left
her
to
an
embarrassed
and
eloquently
silent
mr
magnet
professional
wit
had
deserted
him
it
nice
to
see
you
again
he
said
after
an
immense
interval
shall
we
go
and
look
at
the
aviary
i
hate
to
see
birds
in
cages
said
marjorie
and
it
frightfully
jolly
just
here
do
you
think
wintersloan
will
paint
this
he
does
paint
does
he
i
know
him
best
in
black
and
white
said
mr
magnet
marjorie
embarked
on
entirely
insincere
praises
of
manner
and
personal
effect
magnet
replied
tepidly
with
an
air
of
reserving
himself
to
grapple
with
the
first
conversational
opportunity
it
a
splendid
day
for
tennis
said
marjorie
i
think
i
shall
play
tennis
all
the
afternoon
i
do
play
well
enough
for
this
publicity
it
glorious
exercise
said
marjorie
almost
as
good
as
dancing
and
she
decided
to
stick
to
that
resolution
i
never
lose
a
chance
of
tennis
if
i
can
help
it
she
glanced
round
and
detected
a
widening
space
between
themselves
and
the
next
adjacent
group
they
looking
at
the
goldfish
she
said
let
us
join
them
everyone
moved
away
as
they
came
up
to
the
little
round
pond
but
then
marjorie
had
luck
and
captured
prunella
and
got
her
to
hold
hands
and
talk
until
fraulein
schmidt
called
the
child
away
and
then
marjorie
forced
mr
magnet
to
introduce
her
to
bunford
paradise
she
had
a
bright
idea
of
sitting
between
prunella
and
mary
at
the
lunch
table
but
a
higher
providence
had
assigned
her
to
a
seat
at
the
end
between
julia
or
was
it
kate
and
mr
magnet
however
one
of
the
undergraduates
was
opposite
and
she
saved
herself
from
undertones
by
talking
across
to
him
boldly
about
newnham
though
she
had
an
idea
of
his
name
or
college
from
that
she
came
to
tennis
to
her
inflamed
imagination
he
behaved
as
if
she
was
under
a
taboo
but
she
was
desperate
and
had
pledged
him
and
his
friend
to
a
foursome
before
the
meal
was
over
do
play
said
the
undergraduate
to
mr
magnet
very
little
said
mr
magnet
very
little
at
the
end
of
an
hour
she
was
conspicuously
and
publicly
shepherded
from
the
tennis
court
by
pope
other
people
want
to
play
said
her
mother
in
a
clear
little
undertone
mr
magnet
fielded
her
neatly
as
she
came
off
the
court
you
play
tennis
like
a
wild
bird
he
said
taking
possession
of
her
only
marjorie
entire
freedom
from
irish
blood
saved
him
from
a
vindictive
repartee
shall
we
go
and
look
at
the
aviary
said
mr
magnet
reverting
to
a
favourite
idea
of
his
and
then
remembered
she
did
not
like
to
see
caged
birds
perhaps
we
might
see
the
water
garden
he
said
the
water
garden
is
really
very
delightful
indeed
anyhow
you
ought
to
see
that
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
marjorie
could
think
of
no
objection
to
the
water
garden
and
he
led
her
off
i
often
think
of
that
jolly
walk
we
had
last
summer
said
mr
magnet
and
how
you
talked
about
your
work
at
oxbridge
marjorie
fell
into
a
sudden
rapture
of
admiration
for
a
butterfly
twice
more
was
mr
magnet
baffled
and
then
they
came
to
the
little
pool
of
water
lilies
with
its
miniature
cascade
of
escape
at
the
head
and
source
of
the
water
garden
one
of
lady
petchworth
great
successes
said
mr
magnet
i
suppose
the
lotus
is
like
the
said
marjorie
with
no
hope
of
staving
off
the
inevitable
she
stood
very
still
by
the
little
pool
and
in
spite
of
her
pensive
regard
of
the
floating
blossoms
stiffly
and
intensely
aware
of
his
relentless
regard
marjorie
came
his
voice
at
last
strangely
softened
there
is
something
i
want
to
say
to
you
she
made
no
reply
ever
since
we
met
last
summer
a
clear
cold
little
resolution
not
to
stand
this
had
established
itself
in
marjorie
mind
if
she
must
decide
she
decide
he
had
brought
it
upon
himself
marjorie
said
mr
magnet
i
love
you
she
lifted
a
clear
unhesitating
eye
to
his
face
i
sorry
mr
magnet
she
said
i
wanted
to
ask
you
to
marry
me
he
said
i
sorry
mr
magnet
she
repeated
they
looked
at
one
another
she
felt
a
sort
of
scared
exultation
at
having
done
it
her
mother
might
say
what
she
liked
i
love
you
very
much
he
said
at
a
loss
i
sorry
she
repeated
obstinately
i
thought
you
cared
for
me
a
little
she
left
that
unanswered
she
had
a
curious
feeling
that
there
was
no
getting
away
from
this
splashing
babbling
pool
that
she
was
fixed
there
until
mr
magnet
chose
to
release
her
and
that
he
did
mean
to
release
her
yet
in
which
case
she
would
go
on
refusing
i
disappointed
he
said
marjorie
could
only
think
that
she
was
sorry
again
but
as
she
had
already
said
that
three
times
she
remained
awkwardly
silent
is
it
because
he
began
and
stopped
it
is
because
of
anything
please
let
go
back
to
the
others
mr
magnet
i
sorry
if
i
disappointing
and
by
a
great
effort
she
turned
about
mr
magnet
remained
regarding
her
i
can
only
compare
it
to
the
searching
preliminary
gaze
of
an
artistic
photographer
for
a
crucial
minute
in
his
life
marjorie
hated
him
i
do
understand
he
said
at
last
then
with
a
sort
of
naturalness
that
ought
to
have
touched
her
he
said
is
it
possible
marjorie
that
i
might
hope
that
i
have
been
inopportune
she
answered
at
once
with
absolute
conviction
i
do
think
so
mr
magnet
i
sorry
he
said
to
have
bothered
you
sorry
said
marjorie
a
long
silence
followed
i
sorry
too
he
said
they
said
no
more
but
began
to
retrace
their
steps
it
was
over
abruptly
mr
magnet
bearing
had
become
despondent
conspicuously
despondent
i
had
hoped
he
said
and
sighed
with
a
thrill
of
horror
marjorie
perceived
he
meant
to
rejected
let
every
one
see
he
had
been
rejected
after
encouragement
what
would
they
think
how
would
they
look
what
conceivably
might
they
not
say
something
of
the
importance
of
the
thing
she
had
done
became
manifest
to
her
she
felt
first
intimations
of
regret
they
would
all
be
watching
mother
daffy
lady
petchworth
she
would
reappear
with
this
victim
visibly
suffering
beside
her
what
could
she
say
to
straighten
his
back
and
lift
his
chin
she
could
think
of
nothing
ahead
at
the
end
of
the
shaded
path
she
could
see
the
copious
white
form
the
agitated
fair
wig
and
red
sunshade
of
lady
petchworth
pope
eye
was
relentless
nothing
seemed
hidden
from
it
nothing
indeed
was
hidden
from
it
mr
magnet
back
was
diagrammatic
marjorie
was
a
little
flushed
and
and
professed
herself
eager
with
an
unnatural
enthusiasm
to
play
it
was
eloquently
significant
that
mr
magnet
did
not
share
her
eagerness
declined
to
play
and
yet
when
she
had
started
with
the
rev
jopling
baynes
as
partner
stood
regarding
the
game
with
a
sort
of
tender
melancholy
from
the
shade
of
the
big
pope
joined
him
unobtrusively
you
not
playing
mr
magnet
she
remarked
i
a
this
time
he
said
with
a
sigh
marjorie
winning
i
think
said
pope
he
made
no
answer
for
some
seconds
she
looks
so
charming
in
that
blue
dress
he
remarked
at
last
and
sighed
from
the
lowest
deeps
that
blue
suits
her
said
pope
ignoring
the
sigh
she
clever
in
her
girlish
way
she
chooses
all
her
own
dresses
colours
material
everything
and
also
though
pope
had
not
remarked
it
she
concealed
her
bills
there
came
a
still
longer
interval
which
pope
ended
with
the
slightest
of
shivers
she
perceived
mr
magnet
was
heavy
for
sympathy
and
ripe
to
confide
i
think
she
said
it
a
little
cool
here
shall
we
walk
to
the
water
garden
and
see
if
there
are
any
white
lilies
there
are
said
mr
magnet
sorrowfully
and
they
are
very
beautiful
beautiful
he
turned
to
the
path
along
which
he
had
so
recently
led
marjorie
he
glanced
back
as
they
went
along
between
lady
petchworth
herbaceous
border
and
the
poppy
beds
she
so
full
of
life
he
said
with
a
sigh
in
his
voice
pope
knew
she
must
keep
silent
i
asked
her
to
marry
me
this
afternoon
mr
magnet
blurted
out
i
could
help
it
pope
made
her
silence
very
impressive
i
know
i
ought
not
to
have
done
so
without
consulting
you
he
went
on
lamely
i
very
much
in
love
with
her
it
it
done
no
harm
pope
voice
was
soft
and
low
i
had
no
idea
mr
magnet
you
know
she
is
very
young
twenty
a
mother
i
know
said
magnet
i
can
quite
understand
but
i
done
no
harm
she
refused
me
i
shall
go
away
go
right
away
for
ever
i
sorry
another
long
silence
to
me
of
course
she
just
a
child
pope
said
at
last
she
only
a
child
mr
magnet
she
could
have
had
no
idea
that
anything
of
the
sort
was
in
your
mind
her
words
floated
away
into
the
stillness
for
a
time
they
said
no
more
the
lilies
came
into
sight
dreaming
under
a
rich
green
shade
on
a
limpid
pool
of
brown
water
water
that
slept
and
brimmed
over
as
it
were
unconsciously
into
a
cool
splash
and
ripple
of
escape
how
beautiful
cried
pope
for
a
moment
genuine
i
spoke
to
her
here
said
mr
magnet
the
fountains
of
his
confidence
were
unloosed
now
i
spoken
to
you
about
it
pope
he
said
i
can
tell
you
just
how
i
oh
it
the
only
word
adore
her
she
seems
so
sweet
and
easy
so
graceful
pope
turned
on
him
abruptly
and
grasped
his
hands
she
was
deeply
moved
i
ca
tell
you
she
said
what
it
means
to
a
mother
to
hear
such
things
words
failed
her
and
for
some
moments
they
engaged
in
a
mutual
pressure
ah
said
mr
magnet
and
had
a
queer
wish
it
was
the
mother
he
had
to
deal
with
are
you
sure
mr
magnet
pope
went
on
as
their
emotions
subsided
that
she
really
meant
what
she
said
girls
are
very
strange
creatures
she
seems
so
clear
and
positive
her
manner
is
always
clear
and
positive
yes
i
know
i
know
she
cared
for
you
no
a
mother
sees
when
your
name
used
to
be
mentioned
but
these
are
not
things
to
talk
about
there
is
something
something
sacred
yes
he
said
yes
only
of
course
one
thing
pope
seemed
lost
in
the
contemplation
of
i
wondered
said
mr
magnet
and
paused
again
then
almost
breathlessly
i
wondered
if
there
should
be
perhaps
some
one
else
she
shook
her
head
slowly
i
should
know
she
said
are
you
sure
i
know
i
should
know
perhaps
recently
i
am
sure
i
should
know
a
mother
intuition
memories
possessed
her
for
awhile
a
girl
of
twenty
is
a
mass
of
contradictions
i
can
remember
myself
as
if
it
was
yesterday
often
one
says
no
or
yes
out
of
sheer
nervousness
i
am
sure
there
is
no
other
attachment
it
occurred
to
her
that
she
had
said
enough
what
a
dignity
that
old
has
she
remarked
he
waves
his
tail
as
if
he
were
a
beadle
waving
little
boys
out
of
church
pope
astonished
marjorie
by
saying
nothing
about
the
all
too
obvious
event
of
the
day
for
some
time
but
her
manner
to
her
second
daughter
on
their
way
home
was
strangely
gentle
it
was
as
if
she
had
realized
for
the
first
time
that
regret
and
unhappiness
might
come
into
that
young
life
after
supper
however
she
spoke
they
had
all
gone
out
just
before
the
children
went
to
bed
to
look
for
the
new
moon
daffy
was
showing
the
the
old
moon
in
the
new
moon
arms
and
marjorie
found
herself
standing
by
her
mother
side
i
hope
dear
said
pope
that
it
all
for
the
best
and
that
you
done
wisely
dear
marjorie
was
astonished
and
moved
by
her
mother
tone
it
so
difficult
to
know
what
for
the
best
pope
went
on
i
had
to
do
as
i
did
said
marjorie
i
only
hope
you
may
never
find
you
have
made
a
great
mistake
dear
he
cares
for
you
very
very
much
oh
we
see
it
now
cried
rom
we
see
it
now
mummy
have
you
seen
it
like
a
little
old
round
ghost
being
nursed
when
marjorie
said
pope
kissed
her
with
an
unaccustomed
effusion
it
occurred
to
marjorie
that
after
all
her
mother
had
no
selfish
end
to
serve
in
this
affair
the
idea
that
perhaps
after
all
she
had
made
a
great
mistake
the
mistake
of
her
life
it
might
be
was
quite
firmly
established
in
its
place
among
all
the
other
ideas
in
marjorie
mind
by
the
time
she
had
dressed
next
morning
subsequent
events
greatly
intensified
this
persuasion
a
pair
of
new
stockings
she
had
trusted
sprang
a
bad
hole
as
she
put
them
on
she
found
two
unmistakable
bills
from
oxbridge
beside
her
plate
and
her
father
was
horrid
at
breakfast
her
father
it
appeared
had
bought
the
ordinary
shares
of
a
cuban
railway
very
extensively
on
the
distinct
understanding
that
they
would
improve
in
a
decent
universe
with
a
proper
respect
for
meritorious
gentlemen
these
shares
would
have
improved
accordingly
but
the
weather
had
seen
fit
to
shatter
the
wisdom
of
pope
altogether
the
sugar
crop
had
collapsed
the
bears
were
at
work
and
every
morning
now
saw
his
nominal
capital
diminished
by
a
dozen
pounds
or
so
i
do
not
know
what
pope
would
have
done
if
he
had
not
had
his
family
to
help
him
bear
his
trouble
as
it
was
he
relieved
his
tension
by
sending
theodore
from
the
table
for
dropping
a
knife
telling
rom
when
she
turned
the
plate
round
to
pick
the
largest
banana
that
she
had
the
of
a
child
of
five
and
remarking
sharply
from
behind
the
when
daffy
asked
marjorie
if
she
was
going
to
sketch
oh
for
god
sake
do
then
when
pope
came
round
the
table
and
tried
to
take
his
coffee
cup
softly
to
refill
it
without
troubling
him
he
snatched
at
it
wrenched
it
roughly
out
of
her
hand
and
said
with
his
mouth
full
and
strangely
in
the
manner
of
a
snarling
beast
no
ready
yet
half
foo
marjorie
wanted
to
know
why
every
one
did
get
up
and
leave
the
room
she
glanced
at
her
mother
and
came
near
to
speaking
and
very
soon
she
would
have
to
come
home
and
live
in
the
midst
of
this
again
indefinitely
after
breakfast
she
went
to
the
tumbledown
by
the
duckpond
and
contemplated
the
bills
she
had
not
dared
to
open
at
table
one
was
boots
nearly
three
pounds
the
other
books
over
seven
i
that
wrong
said
marjorie
and
rested
her
chin
on
her
hand
knitted
her
brows
and
tried
to
remember
the
details
of
orders
and
deliveries
marjorie
had
fallen
into
the
net
prepared
for
our
sons
and
daughters
by
the
delicate
modesty
of
the
oxbridge
authorities
in
money
matters
and
she
was
for
her
circumstances
rather
heavily
in
debt
but
i
must
admit
that
in
marjorie
nature
the
oxbridge
conditions
had
found
an
eager
and
adventurous
streak
that
rendered
her
particularly
apt
to
these
temptations
i
doubt
if
reticence
is
really
a
virtue
in
a
teacher
but
this
is
a
fearful
world
and
the
majority
of
those
who
instruct
our
youth
have
the
painful
sensitiveness
of
the
cloistered
soul
to
this
spirit
of
terror
in
things
the
young
need
particularly
to
be
told
truthfully
and
fully
all
we
know
of
three
fundamental
things
the
first
of
which
is
god
the
next
their
duty
towards
their
neighbours
in
the
matter
of
work
and
money
and
the
third
sex
these
things
and
the
adequate
why
of
them
and
some
sort
of
adequate
how
make
all
that
matters
in
education
but
all
three
are
obscure
and
deeply
moving
topics
topics
for
which
the
donnish
mind
has
a
kind
of
special
ineptitude
and
which
it
evades
with
the
utmost
skill
and
delicacy
the
middle
part
of
this
evaded
triad
was
now
being
taken
up
in
marjorie
case
by
the
oxbridge
tradespeople
the
oxbridge
shopkeeper
is
peculiar
among
shopkeepers
in
the
fact
that
he
has
to
do
very
largely
with
shy
and
immature
customers
with
an
extreme
and
distinctive
ignorance
of
most
commercial
things
they
are
for
the
most
part
short
of
cash
but
with
vague
and
often
large
probabilities
of
credit
behind
them
for
most
people
even
quite
straitened
people
will
pull
their
sons
and
daughters
out
of
altogether
unreasonable
debts
at
the
end
of
their
university
career
and
so
the
oxbridge
shopkeeper
becomes
a
sort
of
propagandist
of
the
charms
and
advantages
of
insolvency
alone
among
retailers
he
dislikes
the
sight
of
cash
declines
it
affects
to
regard
it
as
a
coarse
ignorant
truncation
of
a
budding
relationship
begs
to
be
permitted
to
wait
so
the
youngster
just
up
from
home
discovers
that
money
may
stay
in
the
pocket
be
used
for
cab
and
train
fares
and
light
refreshments
all
the
rest
may
be
had
for
the
asking
marjorie
with
her
innate
hunger
for
good
fine
things
with
her
quite
insufficient
and
the
irregular
habits
of
expenditure
a
spasmodically
financed
home
is
apt
to
engender
fell
very
readily
into
this
new
delightful
custom
of
having
it
put
down
whatever
it
happened
to
be
she
had
all
sorts
of
things
put
down
she
and
the
elder
carmel
girl
used
to
go
shopping
together
having
things
put
down
she
brightened
her
rooms
with
and
engravings
got
herself
pretty
and
becoming
clothes
acquired
a
fitted
already
noted
in
this
story
and
one
or
two
other
trifles
of
the
sort
revised
her
created
a
very
nice
little
bookshelf
and
although
at
times
she
felt
a
little
astonished
and
scared
at
herself
resolutely
refused
to
estimate
the
total
of
accumulated
debt
she
had
attained
indeed
until
the
bills
came
in
it
was
impossible
to
do
that
because
following
the
splendid
example
of
the
carmel
girl
she
had
even
inquired
the
price
of
quite
a
number
of
things
she
did
dare
think
now
of
the
total
she
lied
even
to
herself
about
that
she
had
fixed
on
fifty
pounds
as
the
unendurable
maximum
it
is
less
than
fifty
pounds
she
said
and
added
be
but
something
in
her
below
the
threshold
of
consciousness
knew
that
it
was
more
and
now
she
was
in
her
third
year
and
the
oxbridge
tradesman
generally
satisfied
with
the
dimensions
of
her
account
and
no
longer
anxious
to
see
it
grow
was
displaying
the
less
obsequious
side
of
his
character
he
wrote
remarks
at
the
bottom
of
his
account
remarks
about
settlement
about
having
a
bill
to
meet
about
having
something
to
go
on
with
he
asked
her
to
give
the
matter
her
early
attention
she
had
a
disagreeable
persuasion
that
if
she
wanted
many
more
things
anywhere
she
would
have
to
pay
ready
money
for
them
she
was
particularly
short
of
stockings
she
had
overlooked
stockings
recently
daffy
unfortunately
was
also
short
of
stockings
and
now
back
with
her
family
again
everything
conspired
to
remind
marjorie
of
the
old
stringent
habits
from
which
she
had
had
so
delightful
an
interlude
she
saw
daffy
eye
her
possessions
reflect
this
morning
something
of
the
awfulness
of
her
position
came
to
her
at
oxbridge
she
had
made
rather
a
joke
of
her
debts
i
i
have
had
three
pairs
of
house
shoes
said
marjorie
but
what
can
one
do
and
about
the
whole
position
the
question
was
what
can
one
do
she
proceeded
with
tense
nervous
movements
to
tear
these
two
distasteful
demands
into
very
minute
pieces
then
she
collected
them
all
together
in
the
hollow
of
her
hand
and
buried
them
in
the
loose
mould
in
a
corner
of
the
madge
said
theodore
appearing
in
the
sunshine
of
the
doorway
aunt
plessington
coming
she
sent
a
wire
someone
got
to
meet
her
by
the
train
aunt
plessington
descent
was
due
to
her
sudden
discovery
that
buryhamstreet
was
in
close
proximity
to
summerhay
park
indeed
only
three
miles
away
she
had
promised
a
lecture
on
her
movement
for
lady
petchworth
village
room
in
summerhay
and
she
found
that
with
a
slight
readjustment
of
dates
she
could
combine
this
engagement
with
her
promised
visit
to
her
husband
sister
and
an
evening
or
so
of
influence
for
her
little
madge
so
she
had
sent
hubert
to
telegraph
at
once
and
here
she
said
triumphantly
on
the
platform
after
a
hard
kiss
at
marjorie
cheek
we
are
again
there
at
any
rate
she
was
and
uncle
hubert
was
up
the
platform
seeing
after
the
luggage
in
his
small
anxious
way
aunt
plessington
was
a
tall
lean
woman
with
firm
features
a
high
colour
and
a
bright
eye
who
wore
hats
to
show
she
despised
them
and
carefully
dishevelled
hair
her
dress
was
always
good
but
extremely
old
and
grubby
and
she
commanded
respect
chiefly
by
her
voice
her
voice
was
the
true
voice
a
strangulated
contralto
abundant
and
authoritative
it
made
everything
she
said
clear
and
important
so
that
if
she
said
it
was
a
fine
morning
it
was
like
leaded
print
in
the
and
she
had
over
her
large
front
teeth
lips
that
closed
quietly
and
with
a
slight
effort
after
her
speeches
as
if
the
words
she
spoke
tasted
well
and
left
a
peaceful
secure
sensation
in
the
mouth
uncle
hubert
was
a
less
distinguished
figure
and
just
a
little
reminiscent
of
the
small
attached
husbands
one
finds
among
the
lower
crustacea
he
was
much
shorter
and
rounder
than
his
wife
and
if
he
had
been
left
to
himself
he
would
probably
have
been
comfortably
fat
in
his
quiet
little
way
but
aunt
plessington
had
made
him
a
haigite
which
is
one
of
the
fiercer
kinds
of
hygienist
just
in
the
nick
of
time
he
had
round
shoulders
a
large
nose
and
glasses
that
made
him
look
astonished
and
she
said
he
had
a
great
gift
for
practical
things
and
made
him
see
after
everything
in
that
line
while
she
did
the
lecturing
his
directions
to
the
porter
finished
he
came
up
to
his
niece
hello
marjorie
he
said
in
a
peculiar
voice
that
sounded
as
though
his
mouth
was
full
though
of
course
poor
dear
it
was
how
the
first
class
a
second
good
enough
for
me
uncle
hubert
said
marjorie
and
asked
if
they
would
rather
walk
or
go
in
the
donkey
cart
which
was
waiting
outside
with
daffy
aunt
plessington
with
an
air
of
great
said
she
ride
in
the
donkey
cart
and
they
did
but
no
or
theodore
came
to
meet
this
arrival
as
both
uncle
and
aunt
had
a
way
of
asking
how
the
lessons
were
getting
on
that
they
found
extremely
disagreeable
also
their
aunt
measured
them
and
incited
them
with
loud
encouraging
noises
to
grow
one
against
the
other
in
an
urgent
disturbing
fashion
aunt
plessington
being
was
consumed
by
thoughts
of
getting
on
she
was
like
bernard
shaw
life
force
and
she
really
did
not
seem
to
think
there
was
anything
in
existence
but
shoving
she
had
no
idea
what
a
lark
life
can
be
and
occasionally
how
beautiful
it
can
be
when
you
do
not
shove
if
only
which
becomes
increasingly
hard
each
year
you
can
get
away
from
the
shovers
she
was
one
of
an
energetic
family
of
eight
sisters
who
had
maintained
themselves
against
a
mutual
pressure
by
the
use
of
their
elbows
from
the
cradle
they
had
all
married
against
each
other
all
sorts
of
people
two
had
driven
their
husbands
into
bishoprics
and
made
quite
typical
bishop
wives
one
got
a
leading
barrister
one
a
high
official
and
one
a
rich
jew
and
aunt
plessington
after
spending
some
years
in
just
missing
a
rich
and
only
slightly
demented
baronet
had
pounced
it
the
only
word
for
it
on
uncle
hubert
a
woman
is
nothing
without
a
husband
she
said
and
took
him
he
was
a
fairly
comfortable
oxford
don
in
his
furtive
way
and
bringing
him
out
and
using
him
as
a
basis
she
specialized
in
intellectual
philanthropy
and
evolved
her
movement
it
was
quite
remarkable
how
rapidly
she
overhauled
her
sisters
again
what
the
movement
was
varied
considerably
from
time
to
time
but
it
was
always
aggressively
beneficial
towards
the
lower
strata
of
the
community
among
its
central
ideas
was
her
belief
that
these
lower
strata
can
no
more
be
trusted
to
eat
than
they
can
to
drink
and
that
the
licensing
monopoly
which
has
made
the
poor
man
beer
thick
lukewarm
and
discreditable
and
so
greatly
minimized
its
consumption
should
be
extended
to
the
solid
side
of
his
dietary
she
wanted
to
place
considerable
restrictions
upon
the
sale
of
all
sorts
of
meat
upon
groceries
and
the
less
hygienic
and
more
palatable
forms
of
bread
which
do
not
sufficiently
stimulate
the
coatings
of
the
stomach
to
increase
the
present
difficulties
in
the
way
of
tobacco
purchasers
and
to
put
an
end
to
that
wanton
and
deleterious
consumption
of
sweets
which
has
so
bad
an
effect
upon
the
enamel
of
the
teeth
of
the
younger
generation
closely
interwoven
with
these
proposals
was
an
adoption
of
the
principle
of
the
east
purblow
experiment
the
principle
of
payment
in
kind
she
was
quite
in
agreement
with
pope
that
poor
people
when
they
had
money
frittered
it
away
and
so
she
proposed
very
extensive
changes
in
the
truck
act
which
could
enable
employers
under
suitable
safeguards
and
with
the
advice
of
a
small
body
of
spinster
inspectors
to
supply
hygienic
housing
approved
clothing
of
moral
and
wholesome
sort
various
forms
of
insurance
edifying
rations
cuisine
medical
aid
and
educational
facilities
as
circumstances
seemed
to
justify
in
lieu
of
the
wages
the
employees
handled
so
ill
as
no
people
in
england
will
ever
admit
they
belong
to
the
lower
strata
of
society
aunt
plessington
movement
attracted
adherents
from
every
class
in
the
community
she
now
as
they
drove
slowly
to
the
vicarage
recounted
to
marjorie
she
had
the
utmost
contempt
for
daffy
because
of
her
irregular
teeth
and
a
general
lack
of
progressive
activity
the
steady
growth
of
the
movement
and
the
increasing
respect
shown
for
her
and
hubert
in
the
world
of
reform
some
of
the
meetings
she
had
addressed
had
been
quite
full
various
people
had
made
various
remarks
about
her
hostile
for
the
most
part
and
yet
insidiously
flattering
and
everybody
seemed
quite
glad
to
come
to
the
little
dinners
she
gave
in
order
she
said
to
gather
social
support
for
her
reforms
she
had
been
staying
with
the
mastersteins
who
were
keenly
interested
and
after
she
had
polished
off
lady
petchworth
she
was
to
visit
lady
rosenbaum
it
was
all
going
on
swimmingly
these
newer
english
gentry
were
eager
to
learn
all
she
had
to
teach
in
the
art
of
breaking
in
the
villagers
and
now
how
was
marjorie
going
on
and
what
was
going
to
do
in
the
world
marjorie
said
she
was
working
for
her
final
and
what
then
asked
aunt
plessington
not
very
clear
aunt
yet
looking
around
for
something
to
take
up
yes
aunt
well
you
time
yet
and
it
just
as
well
to
see
how
the
land
lies
before
you
begin
it
saves
going
back
you
have
to
come
up
to
london
with
me
for
a
little
while
and
see
things
and
be
seen
a
little
i
should
love
to
i
give
you
a
good
time
said
aunt
plessington
nodding
promisingly
theodore
getting
on
in
school
he
had
his
remove
and
how
sydney
getting
on
with
the
music
excellently
and
rom
rom
getting
on
marjorie
indicated
a
more
restrained
success
and
what
daffy
doing
oh
on
said
daffy
and
suddenly
whacked
the
donkey
rather
hard
i
beg
your
pardon
aunt
i
asked
what
were
up
to
daffy
dusting
aunt
and
the
virtues
said
daffy
you
ought
to
find
something
better
than
that
father
tells
me
a
lot
about
the
east
purblow
experiment
said
daffy
after
a
perceptible
interval
ah
cried
aunt
plessington
with
a
loud
encouraging
note
but
evidently
making
the
best
of
it
better
sociological
observation
yes
aunt
said
daffy
and
negotiated
a
corner
with
exceptional
care
pope
who
had
an
instinctive
disposition
to
pad
when
aunt
plessington
was
about
had
secured
the
presence
at
lunch
of
mr
magnet
who
was
after
all
staying
on
in
buryhamstreet
and
the
rev
jopling
baynes
aunt
plessington
liked
to
meet
the
clergy
and
would
always
if
she
could
win
them
over
to
an
interest
in
the
movement
she
opened
the
meal
with
a
brisk
attack
upon
him
come
baynes
she
said
what
do
your
people
eat
here
hubert
and
i
are
making
a
study
of
the
gluttonous
side
of
village
life
and
we
find
that
no
one
knows
so
much
of
that
as
the
vicar
not
even
the
doctor
the
reverend
jopling
baynes
was
a
clergyman
of
the
evasive
type
with
a
quite
distinguished
voice
he
pursed
his
lips
and
made
his
eyes
round
well
plessington
he
said
and
fingered
his
glass
it
the
usual
dietary
the
usual
dietary
too
much
and
too
rich
badly
cooked
and
eaten
too
fast
said
aunt
plessington
and
what
do
you
think
is
the
remedy
we
make
an
effort
said
the
rev
jopling
baynes
we
make
an
effort
a
hint
here
a
word
there
nothing
organized
no
said
the
rev
jopling
baynes
and
shook
his
head
with
a
kind
of
resignation
we
are
going
to
alter
all
that
said
aunt
plessington
briskly
and
went
on
to
expound
the
movement
and
the
diverse
way
in
which
it
might
be
possible
to
control
and
improve
the
domestic
expenditure
of
the
working
classes
the
rev
jopling
baynes
listened
sympathetically
across
the
table
and
tried
to
satisfy
a
healthy
appetite
with
as
abstemious
an
air
as
possible
while
he
did
so
aunt
plessington
passed
rapidly
from
general
principles
to
a
sketch
of
the
success
of
the
movement
and
hubert
who
had
hitherto
been
busy
with
his
lunch
became
audible
from
behind
the
exceptionally
large
floral
trophy
that
concealed
him
from
his
wife
bubbling
confirmatory
details
she
was
very
bright
and
convincing
as
she
told
of
this
prominent
man
met
and
subdued
that
leading
antagonist
confuted
and
how
the
bishops
were
coming
in
she
made
it
clear
in
her
swift
way
that
an
intelligent
cleric
resolved
to
get
on
in
this
world
for
a
better
one
hereafter
might
do
worse
than
take
up
her
movement
and
this
touched
in
she
turned
her
mind
to
mr
magnet
that
floral
trophy
i
should
explain
by
the
by
was
exceptionally
large
because
of
pope
firm
conviction
that
aunt
plessington
starved
her
husband
accordingly
she
masked
him
and
so
was
able
to
heap
second
and
third
helpings
upon
his
plate
without
aunt
plessington
discovering
his
lapse
the
avidity
with
which
hubert
ate
confirmed
her
worst
suspicions
and
evinced
so
far
as
anything
ever
did
evince
his
gratitude
well
mr
magnet
she
said
i
wish
i
had
your
sense
of
humour
i
wish
you
had
said
mr
magnet
i
should
write
tracts
said
aunt
plessington
i
knew
it
was
good
for
something
said
mr
magnet
and
daffy
laughed
in
a
tentative
way
i
mean
it
said
aunt
plessington
brightly
think
if
we
had
a
dickens
and
you
are
the
nearest
man
alive
to
dickens
on
the
side
of
social
reform
mr
magnet
light
manner
deserted
him
we
do
what
we
can
plessington
he
said
how
much
more
might
be
done
said
aunt
plessington
if
humour
could
be
organized
hear
hear
said
pope
if
all
the
humorists
of
england
could
be
induced
to
laugh
at
something
together
they
do
at
times
said
mr
magnet
but
the
atmosphere
was
too
serious
for
his
light
touch
they
could
laugh
it
out
of
existence
said
aunt
plessington
it
was
evident
mr
magnet
was
struck
by
the
idea
of
course
he
said
in
to
which
i
happen
to
be
an
obscure
occasional
contributor
pope
was
understood
to
protest
that
he
should
not
say
such
things
we
remember
just
what
we
can
do
either
in
the
way
of
advertising
or
injury
i
do
think
you
find
us
up
against
any
really
institutions
but
do
you
think
mr
magnet
you
are
sufficiently
kind
to
the
new
aunt
plessington
persisted
i
think
we
are
all
grateful
to
said
the
rev
jopling
baynes
suddenly
and
sonorously
for
its
steady
determination
to
direct
our
mirth
into
the
proper
channels
i
do
not
think
that
any
one
can
accuse
its
editor
of
being
unmindful
of
his
great
responsibilities
marjorie
found
it
a
very
interesting
conversation
she
always
met
her
aunt
again
with
a
renewal
of
a
kind
of
admiration
that
loud
authoritative
rudeness
that
bold
thrusting
forward
of
the
movement
until
it
became
the
sole
criterion
of
worth
or
success
this
annihilation
by
disregard
of
all
that
aunt
plessington
was
and
and
could
always
in
the
intervals
seemed
too
good
to
be
true
of
course
this
really
was
the
way
people
got
on
and
made
a
mark
but
she
felt
it
must
be
almost
as
trying
to
the
nerves
as
aeronautics
suppose
somewhere
up
there
your
engine
stopped
how
aunt
plessington
dominated
the
table
marjorie
tried
not
to
catch
daffy
eye
daffy
was
unostentatiously
keeping
things
going
watching
the
mustard
rescuing
the
butter
restraining
theodore
and
i
am
afraid
not
listening
very
carefully
to
aunt
plessington
the
children
were
marvellously
silent
and
jumpily
and
pope
in
a
very
unusual
state
of
subdued
amiability
sat
at
the
end
of
the
table
with
the
east
purblow
experiment
on
the
tip
of
his
tongue
he
liked
aunt
plessington
and
she
was
good
for
him
they
had
the
same
inherent
distrust
of
the
intelligence
and
good
intentions
of
their
fellow
creatures
and
she
had
the
knack
of
making
him
feel
that
he
too
was
getting
on
that
she
was
saying
things
on
his
behalf
in
influential
quarters
and
in
spite
of
the
almost
universal
conspiracy
based
on
jealousy
to
ignore
his
stern
virtues
he
might
still
be
able
to
battle
his
way
to
the
floor
of
the
house
of
commons
and
there
deliver
himself
before
he
died
of
a
few
sorely
needed
about
motor
cars
decadence
and
frivolity
generally
after
lunch
aunt
plessington
took
her
little
madge
for
an
energetic
walk
and
showed
herself
far
more
observant
than
the
egotism
of
her
conversation
at
that
meal
might
have
led
one
to
suppose
or
perhaps
she
was
only
better
informed
aunt
plessington
loved
a
good
hard
walk
in
the
afternoon
and
if
she
could
get
any
one
else
to
accompany
her
then
hubert
stayed
at
home
and
curled
up
into
a
ball
on
a
sofa
somewhere
and
took
a
little
siesta
that
made
him
all
the
brighter
for
the
intellectual
activities
of
the
evening
the
thought
of
a
young
life
new
untarnished
just
at
the
outset
just
addressing
itself
to
the
task
of
getting
on
always
stimulated
her
mind
extremely
and
she
talked
to
marjorie
with
a
very
real
and
effectual
desire
to
help
her
to
the
utmost
of
her
ability
she
talked
of
a
start
in
life
and
the
sort
of
start
she
had
had
she
showed
how
many
people
who
began
with
great
advantages
did
not
shove
sufficiently
and
so
dropped
out
of
things
and
were
seen
and
mentioned
she
defended
herself
for
marrying
hubert
and
showed
what
a
clever
shoving
thing
it
had
been
to
do
it
startled
people
a
little
and
made
them
realize
that
here
was
a
woman
who
wanted
something
more
in
a
man
than
a
handsome
she
made
it
clear
that
she
thought
a
clever
marriage
if
not
a
startlingly
brilliant
one
the
first
duty
of
a
girl
it
was
a
girl
normal
gambit
she
branched
off
to
the
things
single
women
might
do
in
order
to
justify
this
view
she
did
not
think
single
women
could
do
very
much
they
might
perhaps
shove
as
suffragettes
but
even
there
a
husband
helped
tremendously
if
only
by
refusing
to
bail
you
out
she
ran
over
the
cases
of
a
number
of
prominent
single
women
and
what
said
aunt
plessington
do
they
all
amount
to
a
girl
is
so
hampered
and
an
old
maid
is
so
neglected
said
aunt
plessington
she
paused
why
do
you
up
and
marry
mr
magnet
marjorie
she
said
with
her
most
brilliant
flash
it
takes
two
to
make
a
marriage
aunt
said
marjorie
after
a
slight
hesitation
my
dear
child
he
worships
the
ground
you
tread
on
said
aunt
plessington
he
rather
grown
up
said
marjorie
not
a
bit
of
it
he
not
forty
he
just
the
age
i
afraid
it
a
little
impossible
impossible
you
see
i
refused
him
aunt
naturally
the
first
time
but
i
would
send
him
packing
the
second
there
was
an
interval
marjorie
decided
on
a
blunt
question
do
you
really
think
aunt
i
should
do
well
to
marry
mr
magnet
he
give
you
everything
a
clever
woman
needs
said
aunt
plessington
everything
with
swift
capable
touches
she
indicated
the
sort
of
life
the
future
mrs
magnet
might
enjoy
he
evidently
a
man
who
wants
helping
to
a
position
she
said
of
course
his
farces
and
things
i
told
make
no
end
of
money
but
he
just
a
crude
gift
by
himself
money
like
that
is
nothing
with
a
clever
wife
he
might
be
all
sorts
of
things
without
one
he
just
subside
you
know
the
sort
of
thing
this
sort
of
man
does
a
rather
eccentric
humorous
house
in
the
country
golf
croquet
queer
hats
is
that
rather
what
he
would
like
to
do
aunt
said
marjorie
that
not
business
madge
said
aunt
plessington
with
humorous
emphasis
she
began
to
sketch
out
a
different
and
altogether
smarter
future
for
the
fortunate
humorist
there
would
be
a
house
in
a
good
central
position
in
london
where
marjorie
would
have
bright
successful
lunches
and
dinners
very
unpretending
and
very
good
and
tempt
the
clever
smart
with
the
lure
of
the
interestingly
clever
there
would
be
a
bright
little
country
cottage
in
some
pretty
accessible
place
to
which
aunt
and
uncle
plessington
and
able
and
influential
people
generally
could
be
invited
for
gaily
recreative
and
yet
extremely
talkative
and
helpful
both
places
could
be
made
centres
of
intrigue
conspiracies
for
getting
on
and
helping
and
exchanging
help
could
be
organized
people
could
be
warned
against
people
whose
was
undesirable
in
the
midst
of
it
all
dressed
with
all
the
natural
wit
she
had
and
an
enlarging
experience
would
be
marjorie
shining
like
a
rising
planet
it
would
be
long
if
she
did
things
well
before
she
had
permanent
officials
and
young
cabinet
ministers
mingling
with
her
salad
of
writers
and
humorists
and
the
plessington
connexion
then
said
aunt
plessington
with
a
joyous
lift
in
her
voice
begin
to
a
little
for
a
time
the
girl
mind
resisted
her
but
marjorie
was
of
the
impressionable
sex
at
an
impressionable
age
and
there
was
something
overwhelming
in
the
undeviating
conviction
of
her
aunt
in
the
clear
assurance
of
her
voice
that
this
life
which
interested
her
was
the
real
life
the
only
possible
successful
life
the
world
reformed
itself
in
marjorie
fluent
mind
until
it
was
all
a
scheme
of
influence
and
effort
and
ambition
and
triumphs
and
receptions
men
wearing
orders
cabinet
ministers
more
than
a
little
in
love
asking
her
advice
beautiful
robes
a
great
blaze
of
lights
why
she
might
be
said
aunt
plessington
rising
to
enthusiasm
another
marcella
the
life
was
not
without
its
adventurous
side
it
was
in
any
way
dull
aunt
plessington
to
illustrate
that
point
told
amusing
anecdotes
of
how
two
almost
impudent
invitations
on
her
part
had
succeeded
and
how
she
had
once
scored
off
her
elder
sister
by
getting
a
coveted
celebrity
through
their
close
family
resemblance
after
accepting
he
could
very
well
refuse
because
i
was
somebody
else
she
ended
gleefully
so
he
came
and
stayed
as
long
as
anybody
what
else
was
there
for
marjorie
to
contemplate
if
she
did
take
this
by
no
means
unattractive
line
what
was
the
alternative
some
sort
of
employment
after
a
battle
with
her
father
a
parsimonious
life
and
even
then
the
oxbridge
tradesmen
and
their
immortal
bills
aunt
plessington
was
so
intent
upon
her
theme
that
she
heeded
nothing
of
the
delightful
little
flowers
she
trampled
under
foot
across
the
down
nor
the
jolly
squirrel
with
an
artistic
temperament
who
saw
fit
to
give
an
uninvited
opinion
upon
her
personal
appearance
from
the
security
of
a
in
the
wood
but
marjorie
noting
quite
a
number
of
such
things
with
the
corner
of
her
mind
and
being
now
well
under
the
plessington
sway
wished
she
had
more
concentration
in
the
evening
after
supper
the
customary
games
were
suspended
and
and
plessington
talked
about
getting
on
and
work
and
efficiency
generally
and
explained
how
had
spoilt
his
chances
in
life
and
why
was
sure
to
achieve
nothing
and
how
this
man
ate
too
much
and
that
man
drank
too
much
and
on
the
contrary
what
promising
and
capable
people
the
latest
adherents
of
and
subscribers
to
the
movement
were
until
two
glasses
of
hot
water
came
aunt
plessington
had
been
told
it
was
good
for
her
digestion
and
she
thought
it
just
as
well
that
hubert
should
have
some
too
and
it
was
time
for
every
one
to
go
to
bed
next
morning
an
atmosphere
of
getting
on
and
strenuosity
generally
prevailed
throughout
the
vicarage
the
plessingtons
were
preparing
a
memorandum
on
their
movement
for
the
reformer
year
book
every
word
was
of
importance
and
might
win
or
lose
adherents
and
subscribers
and
they
secured
the
undisturbed
possession
of
the
from
which
the
higher
notes
of
aunt
plessington
voice
explaining
the
whole
thing
to
hubert
who
had
to
write
it
out
reached
a
spur
to
effort
into
every
part
of
the
house
their
influence
touched
every
one
marjorie
struck
by
the
idea
that
she
was
not
perhaps
getting
on
at
oxbridge
so
fast
as
she
ought
to
do
went
into
the
with
marshall
principles
of
economics
read
for
two
hours
and
did
not
think
about
her
bills
for
more
than
a
quarter
of
the
time
rom
who
had
already
got
up
early
and
read
through
about
a
third
of
aurora
leigh
now
set
herself
with
dogged
determination
to
finish
that
great
poem
syd
practised
an
extra
ten
minutes
for
aunt
plessington
did
mind
practice
so
long
as
there
was
a
tune
pope
went
into
the
kitchen
and
made
a
fuss
about
the
waste
of
rice
pope
began
the
pamphlet
he
had
had
in
contemplation
for
some
time
upon
the
advantages
to
public
order
of
payment
in
kind
theodore
who
had
washed
behind
his
ears
and
laced
his
boots
in
all
the
holes
went
into
the
yard
before
breakfast
and
hit
a
tennis
ball
against
the
wall
and
back
five
hundred
and
times
a
record
he
would
have
resumed
this
after
breakfast
but
his
father
came
round
the
corner
of
the
house
with
a
pen
in
his
mouth
and
asked
him
indistinctly
but
fiercely
what
the
he
was
doing
so
he
went
away
and
after
a
fretful
interval
set
himself
to
revise
his
latin
irregular
verbs
by
twelve
he
had
done
wonders
later
in
the
day
the
widening
circle
of
aggressive
urgency
reached
the
kitchen
and
at
two
the
cook
gave
notice
in
order
she
said
to
better
herself
lunch
unconscious
of
this
impending
shadow
was
characterized
by
a
virtuous
cheerfulness
and
aunt
plessington
told
in
detail
how
her
seven
and
twenty
nephews
and
nieces
the
children
of
her
various
sisters
were
all
getting
on
on
the
whole
they
were
not
getting
on
so
brilliantly
as
they
might
have
done
which
indeed
is
apt
to
be
the
case
with
the
children
of
people
who
have
loved
not
well
but
too
wisely
and
it
was
borne
in
upon
the
mind
of
the
respectfully
listening
marjorie
that
to
borrow
an
easy
colloquialism
of
her
aunt
she
might
take
the
shine
out
of
the
lot
of
them
with
a
very
little
zeal
and
effort
and
of
course
mr
magnet
the
lecture
in
the
evening
at
summerhay
was
a
great
success
the
chair
was
taken
by
the
rev
jopling
baynes
lady
petchworth
was
enthroned
behind
the
table
hubert
was
in
charge
of
his
wife
notes
if
notes
should
be
needed
and
pope
expectant
of
an
invitation
at
the
end
to
say
a
few
words
about
the
east
purblow
experiment
also
occupied
a
chair
on
the
platform
lady
petchworth
with
her
abundant
soft
blond
hair
brightly
blond
still
in
spite
of
her
years
her
delicate
features
her
plump
hands
her
numerous
chins
and
her
entirely
inaudible
voice
made
a
pleasing
contrast
with
aunt
resolute
personality
she
had
perhaps
an
even
greater
assurance
of
authority
but
it
was
a
quiet
assurance
you
felt
that
she
knew
that
if
she
spoke
in
her
sleep
she
would
be
obeyed
that
it
was
quite
unnecessary
to
make
herself
heard
the
two
women
indeed
the
one
so
assertive
the
other
so
established
were
at
the
opposite
poles
of
authoritative
british
womanhood
and
harmonized
charmingly
the
little
room
struck
the
note
of
a
brightness
at
every
point
it
had
been
decorated
in
a
keltic
but
entirely
respectful
style
by
one
of
lady
petchworth
artistic
discoveries
it
was
lit
by
paraffin
lamps
that
smelt
hardly
at
all
and
it
was
gay
with
colour
prints
illustrating
the
growth
of
the
british
empire
from
the
battle
of
ethandune
to
the
surrender
of
cronje
the
hall
was
fairly
full
few
could
afford
to
absent
themselves
from
these
brightening
occasions
but
there
was
a
tendency
on
the
part
of
the
younger
and
the
less
thoughtful
section
of
the
village
manhood
to
accumulate
at
the
extreme
back
and
rumble
in
what
appeared
to
be
a
slightly
ironical
spirit
so
far
as
it
had
any
spirit
with
its
feet
the
rev
jopling
baynes
opened
proceedings
with
a
few
remarks
in
which
he
complimented
every
one
present
either
singly
or
collectively
according
to
their
rank
and
importance
and
then
aunt
plessington
came
forward
to
the
centre
of
the
platform
amidst
a
hectic
flush
of
applause
and
said
haw
in
a
loud
clear
ringing
tone
she
spoke
without
resorting
to
the
notes
in
hubert
little
fist
very
freely
and
easily
her
strangulated
contralto
went
into
every
corner
of
the
room
and
positively
seemed
to
look
for
and
challenge
inattentive
auditors
she
had
come
over
she
said
and
she
had
been
very
glad
to
come
over
and
talk
to
them
that
night
because
it
meant
not
only
seeing
them
but
meeting
her
very
dear
delightful
friend
lady
petchworth
loud
applause
and
staying
for
a
day
or
so
with
her
pope
unsupported
outburst
of
applause
from
mr
magnet
to
whom
she
and
social
reform
generally
owed
so
much
she
had
come
to
talk
to
them
that
night
about
the
national
good
habits
movement
which
was
attracting
so
much
attention
and
which
bore
so
closely
on
our
national
life
and
character
she
happened
to
be
here
aunt
plessington
smiled
as
she
spoke
a
humble
person
connected
with
that
movement
just
a
mere
woman
connected
with
it
she
was
going
to
explain
to
them
as
well
as
she
could
in
her
womanly
way
and
in
the
time
at
her
disposal
just
what
it
was
and
just
what
it
was
for
and
just
what
means
it
adopted
and
just
what
ends
it
had
in
view
well
they
all
knew
what
habits
were
and
that
there
were
good
habits
and
bad
habits
and
she
supposed
that
the
difference
between
a
good
man
and
a
bad
man
was
just
that
the
good
man
had
good
habits
and
the
bad
one
had
bad
habits
everybody
she
supposed
wanted
to
get
on
if
a
man
had
good
habits
he
got
on
and
if
he
had
bad
habits
he
did
get
on
and
she
supposed
it
was
the
same
with
a
country
if
its
people
had
good
habits
they
got
on
and
if
its
people
had
bad
habits
they
did
get
on
for
her
own
part
she
and
her
husband
hubert
gave
a
little
jump
had
always
cultivated
good
habits
and
she
had
to
thank
him
with
all
her
heart
for
his
help
in
doing
so
applause
from
the
front
seats
now
the
whole
idea
of
her
movement
was
to
ask
how
can
we
raise
the
standard
of
the
national
habits
how
can
we
get
rid
of
bad
habits
and
cultivate
good
ones
here
there
was
a
slight
interruption
due
to
some
one
being
suddenly
pushed
off
the
end
of
a
form
at
the
back
and
coming
to
the
floor
with
audible
violence
after
which
a
choked
and
obstructed
tittering
continued
intermittently
for
some
time
some
of
her
audience
she
remarked
had
not
yet
acquired
the
habit
of
sitting
still
laughter
and
a
coarse
vulgar
voice
good
old
billy
punt
well
to
resume
she
and
her
husband
had
made
a
special
and
careful
study
of
habits
they
had
consulted
all
sorts
of
people
and
collected
all
sorts
of
statistics
in
fact
they
had
devoted
themselves
to
this
question
and
the
conclusion
to
which
they
came
was
this
that
good
habits
were
acquired
by
training
and
bad
habits
came
from
neglect
and
carelessness
and
leaving
people
who
were
fit
for
such
freedom
to
run
about
and
do
just
whatever
they
liked
and
so
she
went
on
with
a
note
of
complete
demonstration
the
problem
resolved
itself
into
the
question
of
how
far
they
could
get
more
training
into
the
national
life
and
how
they
could
check
extravagant
and
unruly
and
wasteful
and
unwise
ways
of
living
hear
hear
from
mr
pope
and
this
was
the
problem
she
and
her
husband
had
set
themselves
to
solve
scuffle
and
a
boy
voice
at
the
back
saying
oh
it
nuts
shut
it
well
she
and
her
husband
had
worked
the
thing
out
and
they
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
what
was
the
matter
with
the
great
mass
of
english
people
was
first
that
they
had
rather
too
much
loose
money
and
secondly
that
they
had
rather
too
much
loose
time
a
voice
what
o
and
the
rev
jopling
baynes
suddenly
extended
his
neck
knitted
his
brows
and
became
observant
of
the
interrupter
she
did
not
say
they
had
too
much
money
a
second
voice
not
arf
but
too
much
money
she
did
not
say
they
had
too
much
time
but
too
much
loose
time
that
is
to
say
they
had
money
and
time
they
did
not
know
how
to
spend
properly
and
so
they
got
into
mischief
a
great
number
of
people
in
this
country
she
maintained
and
this
was
especially
true
of
the
lower
classes
did
not
know
how
to
spend
either
money
or
time
they
bought
themselves
wasteful
things
and
injurious
things
and
they
frittered
away
their
hours
in
all
sorts
of
foolish
unprofitable
ways
and
after
the
most
careful
and
scientific
study
of
this
problem
she
and
her
husband
had
come
to
the
conclusion
that
two
main
principles
must
underlie
any
remedial
measures
that
were
attempted
the
first
of
which
was
the
principle
of
payment
in
kind
which
had
already
had
so
interesting
a
trial
at
the
great
carriage
works
of
east
purblow
and
the
second
the
principle
of
continuous
occupation
which
had
been
recognized
long
ago
in
popular
wisdom
by
that
admirable
proverb
or
rather
quotation
she
believed
it
was
a
quotation
though
she
gave
she
feared
very
little
time
to
poetry
better
employed
from
pope
satan
finds
some
mischief
still
for
idle
hands
to
do
irrepressible
outbreak
of
wild
and
sustained
applause
from
the
back
seats
and
in
a
sudden
lull
a
female
voice
asking
in
a
flattened
thwarted
tone
ai
there
to
be
no
lantern
then
the
lecturer
went
on
to
explain
what
was
meant
by
either
member
of
what
perhaps
they
would
permit
her
to
call
this
social
remedy
it
was
an
admirable
piece
of
lucid
exposition
slowly
the
picture
of
a
better
happier
more
disciplined
england
grew
upon
the
minds
of
the
meeting
first
she
showed
the
new
sort
of
employer
her
movement
would
evoke
an
employer
paternal
philanthropic
vaguely
responsible
for
the
social
order
of
all
his
dependants
lady
petchworth
was
seen
to
nod
her
head
slowly
at
this
only
in
the
last
resort
and
when
he
was
satisfied
that
his
worker
and
his
worker
family
were
properly
housed
hygienically
clothed
and
fed
attending
suitable
courses
of
instruction
and
free
from
any
vicious
inclinations
would
he
pay
wages
in
cash
in
the
discharge
of
the
duties
of
payment
he
would
have
the
assistance
of
expert
advice
and
the
stimulus
of
voluntary
inspectors
of
his
own
class
he
would
be
the
natural
the
captain
and
leader
adviser
and
caretaker
of
his
banded
employees
responsibility
would
stimulate
him
and
if
responsibility
did
not
stimulate
him
inspectors
both
men
and
women
inspectors
would
the
worker
on
the
other
hand
would
be
enormously
more
healthy
and
efficient
under
the
new
régime
his
home
designed
by
qualified
and
officially
recognized
architects
would
be
prettier
as
well
as
more
convenient
and
elevating
to
his
taste
his
children
admirably
trained
and
dressed
in
the
new
and
more
beautiful
clothing
with
which
lady
petchworth
applause
had
done
so
much
to
make
them
familiar
his
vital
statistics
compared
with
current
results
would
be
astonishingly
good
his
mind
free
from
any
anxiety
but
the
proper
anxiety
of
a
man
in
his
position
to
get
his
work
done
properly
and
earn
recognition
from
those
competent
and
duly
authorized
to
judge
it
of
all
this
she
spoke
with
the
inspiring
note
of
absolute
conviction
all
this
would
follow
payment
in
kind
and
continuous
occupation
as
days
follow
sunrise
and
there
would
always
and
here
aunt
plessington
voice
seemed
to
brighten
be
something
for
the
worker
to
get
on
with
something
for
him
to
do
lectures
classes
improving
entertainments
his
time
would
be
filled
the
proper
authorities
would
see
that
it
was
filled
and
filled
in
the
right
way
never
for
a
moment
need
he
be
bored
he
would
never
have
an
excuse
for
being
bored
that
was
the
second
great
idea
the
complementary
idea
to
the
first
and
here
it
is
she
said
turning
a
large
encouraging
smile
on
lady
petchworth
that
the
work
of
a
national
theatre
instructive
stimulating
well
regulated
and
morally
sustaining
would
come
in
he
would
of
course
be
to
go
but
there
would
be
his
seat
part
of
his
payment
in
kind
and
the
would
be
shut
most
other
temptations
would
be
removed
the
lecture
reached
its
end
at
last
with
only
one
other
interruption
some
humorist
suddenly
inquired
of
nothing
the
fare
to
america
billy
and
a
voice
presumably
billy
answered
him
mor
ev
in
pocket
the
rev
jopling
baynes
before
he
called
upon
pope
for
his
promised
utterance
about
east
purblow
could
not
refrain
from
pointing
out
how
silly
in
every
sense
of
the
word
these
wanton
interruptions
were
what
he
asked
had
english
social
reform
to
do
with
the
fare
to
america
and
having
roused
the
meeting
to
an
alert
silence
by
the
length
of
his
pause
answered
in
a
voice
of
ringing
contempt
nothing
then
pope
made
his
few
remarks
about
east
purblow
with
the
ease
and
finish
that
comes
from
long
practice
much
he
said
had
to
be
omitted
in
view
of
the
restricted
time
at
his
disposal
but
he
did
not
grudge
that
the
time
had
been
better
filled
no
no
from
aunt
plessington
yes
yes
by
the
lucid
and
delightful
lecture
they
had
all
enjoyed
and
he
not
least
among
them
they
came
out
into
a
luminous
blue
night
with
a
crescent
young
moon
high
overhead
it
was
so
fine
that
the
popes
and
the
plessingtons
and
mr
magnet
declined
lady
petchworth
proffered
car
and
walked
back
to
buryhamstreet
across
the
park
through
a
sleeping
pallid
cornfield
and
along
by
the
edge
of
the
pine
woods
pope
would
have
liked
to
walk
with
mr
magnet
and
explain
all
that
the
pressure
on
his
time
had
caused
him
to
omit
from
his
speech
and
why
it
was
he
had
seen
fit
to
omit
this
part
and
include
that
some
occult
power
however
baffled
this
intention
and
he
found
himself
going
home
in
the
company
of
his
and
daffy
with
aunt
plessington
and
his
wife
like
a
barrier
between
him
and
his
desire
marjorie
on
the
other
hand
found
mr
magnet
proximity
inevitable
they
fell
a
little
behind
and
were
together
again
for
the
first
time
since
her
refusal
he
behaved
she
thought
with
very
great
restraint
and
indeed
he
left
her
a
little
doubtful
on
that
occasion
whether
he
had
not
decided
to
take
her
decision
as
final
he
talked
chiefly
about
the
lecture
which
had
impressed
him
very
deeply
plessington
he
said
was
so
splendid
made
him
feel
trivial
he
felt
stirred
up
by
her
wanted
to
help
in
this
social
work
this
picking
up
of
helpless
people
from
the
muddle
in
which
they
wallowed
he
seemed
not
only
extraordinarily
modest
but
extraordinarily
gentle
that
night
and
the
warm
moonshine
gave
his
face
a
shadowed
earnestness
it
lacked
in
more
emphatic
lights
she
felt
the
profound
change
in
her
feelings
towards
him
that
had
followed
her
rejection
of
him
it
had
cleared
away
his
effect
of
oppression
upon
her
she
had
no
longer
any
sense
of
entanglement
and
pursuit
and
all
the
virtues
his
courtship
had
obscured
shone
clear
again
he
was
kindly
he
was
patient
and
she
felt
something
about
him
a
woman
is
said
always
to
respect
he
gave
her
an
impression
of
ability
after
all
he
could
banish
the
trouble
that
crushed
and
overwhelmed
her
with
a
movement
of
his
little
finger
of
all
her
load
of
debt
he
could
earn
the
payment
in
a
day
your
aunt
goes
he
said
marjorie
admitted
it
i
wish
i
could
talk
to
her
more
she
so
inspiring
you
know
of
our
little
excursion
for
friday
he
asked
after
a
pause
she
had
not
heard
friday
was
theodore
birthday
she
knew
it
only
too
well
because
she
had
had
to
part
with
her
stamp
collection
which
very
luckily
had
chanced
to
get
packed
and
come
to
buryhamstreet
to
meet
its
demand
mr
magnet
explained
he
had
thought
it
might
be
fun
to
give
a
picnic
in
honour
of
the
anniversary
how
jolly
of
you
said
marjorie
there
a
pretty
bit
of
river
between
wamping
and
friston
hanger
wanted
you
to
see
it
for
a
long
time
and
friston
hanger
church
has
the
prettiest
view
the
tower
gets
the
bend
of
the
river
he
told
her
all
he
meant
to
do
as
if
he
submitted
his
plans
for
her
approval
they
would
drive
to
wamping
and
get
a
very
comfortable
little
steam
launch
one
could
hire
there
wintersloan
was
coming
down
again
an
idle
day
of
this
kind
just
suited
his
temperament
theodore
would
like
it
would
he
theodore
will
think
he
is
king
of
surrey
i
have
a
rod
and
line
if
he
wants
to
fish
i
do
want
to
forget
anything
i
want
it
to
be
day
really
and
truly
the
slightest
touch
upon
the
pathetic
note
she
could
not
tell
but
that
evening
brought
marjorie
nearer
to
loving
magnet
than
she
had
ever
been
before
she
went
to
sleep
that
night
she
had
decided
he
was
quite
a
tolerable
person
again
she
had
been
too
nervous
and
unjust
with
him
after
all
his
urgency
and
awkwardness
had
been
just
a
part
of
his
sincerity
perhaps
the
faint
doubt
whether
he
would
make
his
request
again
gave
the
zest
of
uncertainty
to
his
devotion
of
course
she
told
herself
he
would
ask
again
and
then
the
blissful
air
of
limitless
means
she
might
breathe
the
blessed
release
she
was
suddenly
fast
asleep
friday
was
after
all
not
so
much
theodore
day
as
mr
magnet
until
she
found
herself
committed
there
was
no
shadow
of
doubt
in
marjorie
mind
of
what
she
meant
to
do
before
i
see
you
again
said
aunt
plessington
at
the
parting
kiss
i
hope
you
have
something
to
tell
me
she
might
have
been
hymen
thinly
disguised
as
an
aunt
waving
from
the
departing
train
she
continued
by
vigorous
gestures
and
unstinted
display
of
teeth
and
a
fluttering
handkerchief
to
encourage
marjorie
to
marry
mr
magnet
until
the
curve
of
the
cutting
hid
her
from
view
fortune
favoured
mr
magnet
with
a
beautiful
day
and
the
excursion
was
bright
and
successful
from
the
outset
it
was
done
well
and
what
perhaps
was
more
calculated
to
impress
marjorie
it
was
done
with
lavish
generosity
from
the
outset
she
turned
a
smiling
countenance
upon
her
host
she
did
her
utmost
to
suppress
a
reviving
irrational
qualm
in
her
being
to
maintain
clearly
and
simply
her
overnight
decision
that
he
should
propose
again
and
that
she
should
accept
him
yet
the
festival
was
just
a
little
dreamlike
in
its
quality
to
her
perceptions
she
found
she
could
not
focus
clearly
on
its
details
two
waggonettes
came
from
wamping
there
was
room
for
everybody
and
to
spare
and
wamping
revealed
itself
a
pleasant
small
country
town
with
stocks
under
the
market
hall
and
just
that
tint
of
green
paint
and
that
loafing
touch
the
presence
of
a
boating
river
gives
the
launch
was
brilliantly
smart
with
abundant
crimson
cushions
and
a
tasselled
awning
and
away
to
the
left
was
a
fine
old
bridge
that
dated
in
its
essentials
from
plantagenet
times
they
started
with
much
whistling
and
circling
and
went
away
up
river
under
overhanging
trees
that
sometimes
swished
the
funnel
splashing
the
meadow
path
and
making
the
reeds
and
bulrushes
dance
with
their
wash
they
went
through
a
reluctant
lock
steamed
up
a
long
reach
they
passed
the
queerly
painted
potwell
inn
with
its
picturesque
group
of
poplars
and
its
absurd
new
of
omlets
theodore
was
five
stone
of
active
happiness
he
and
the
strictly
under
his
orders
as
the
universal
etiquette
of
birthdays
prescribes
clambered
round
and
round
the
boat
clutching
the
awning
rail
and
hanging
over
the
water
in
an
entirely
secure
and
perilous
looking
manner
no
one
unless
his
father
happened
to
be
upset
by
something
would
check
him
he
knew
on
this
auspicious
day
mr
magnet
sat
with
the
grey
eye
on
marjorie
and
listened
a
little
abstractedly
to
pope
who
was
telling
very
fully
what
he
would
say
if
the
liberal
party
were
to
ask
his
advice
at
the
present
juncture
pope
attended
discreetly
and
daffy
and
marjorie
with
a
less
restrained
interest
to
wintersloan
who
showed
them
how
to
make
faces
out
of
a
fist
tied
up
in
a
how
to
ventriloquize
how
to
conjure
with
halfpence
which
he
did
very
amusingly
and
what
the
buttons
on
a
man
sleeve
were
for
theodore
clambering
at
his
back
discovered
what
he
was
at
and
by
right
of
birthday
made
him
do
all
the
faces
and
tricks
over
again
then
wintersloan
told
stories
of
all
the
rivers
along
which
he
said
he
had
travelled
in
steamboats
the
rhine
the
danube
the
hoogly
and
the
fall
river
and
particularly
how
he
had
been
bitten
by
a
very
young
crocodile
it
the
smell
of
the
oil
brings
it
all
back
to
me
he
said
and
the
kind
of
sway
it
gives
you
he
made
sinuous
movements
of
his
hand
and
looked
at
marjorie
with
that
wooden
yet
expressive
smile
friston
hanger
proved
to
be
even
better
than
wamping
it
had
a
character
of
its
own
because
it
was
built
very
largely
of
a
warm
buff
coloured
local
rock
instead
of
the
usual
brick
and
the
outhouses
at
least
of
the
little
inn
at
which
they
landed
were
thatched
most
of
the
cottages
had
casement
windows
with
diamond
panes
and
the
streets
were
cobbled
and
very
hill
the
place
ran
to
high
walls
richly
suggestive
of
hidden
gardens
overhung
by
big
trees
and
pierced
by
secretive
important
looking
doors
and
over
it
all
rose
an
unusually
big
church
with
a
tall
buttressed
tower
surmounted
by
a
lantern
of
pierced
stone
we
go
through
the
town
and
look
at
the
ruins
of
the
old
castle
beyond
the
church
said
mr
magnet
to
marjorie
and
then
i
want
you
to
see
the
view
from
the
church
tower
and
as
they
went
through
the
street
he
called
her
attention
again
to
the
church
tower
in
a
voice
that
seemed
to
her
to
be
inexplicably
charged
with
significance
i
want
you
to
go
up
there
he
said
how
about
something
to
eat
mr
magnet
remarked
theodore
suddenly
and
everybody
felt
a
little
surprised
when
mr
magnet
answered
who
wants
things
to
eat
on
your
birthday
theodore
but
they
saw
the
joke
of
that
when
they
reached
the
castle
ruins
and
found
in
the
old
tilting
yard
with
its
arch
framing
a
view
of
the
town
and
stream
a
table
spread
with
a
white
cloth
that
shone
in
the
sunshine
glittering
with
glass
and
silver
and
gay
with
a
bowl
of
salad
and
flowers
and
cold
pies
and
a
jug
of
and
an
ice
pail
a
silver
pail
containing
two
promising
looking
bottles
in
the
charge
of
two
real
live
waiters
in
evening
dress
as
waiters
should
be
but
with
straw
hats
to
protect
them
from
the
sun
and
weather
oh
cried
pope
what
a
idea
mr
magnet
when
the
destination
of
the
feast
was
perfectly
clear
and
even
theodore
seemed
a
little
overawed
almost
as
if
he
felt
his
birthday
was
being
carried
too
far
and
might
provoke
a
judgment
later
manifestly
mr
magnet
must
have
ordered
this
in
london
and
have
had
it
sent
down
waiters
and
all
theodore
knew
he
was
a
very
wonderful
little
boy
in
spite
of
the
acute
criticism
of
four
devoted
sisters
and
mr
magnet
had
noticed
him
before
at
times
but
this
was
well
rather
immense
look
at
the
old
man
and
on
the
and
on
the
icing
of
the
cake
their
munificent
host
had
caused
to
be
done
in
little
raised
letters
of
dough
and
chocolate
the
word
theodore
oh
magnet
said
marjorie
his
eye
so
obviously
invited
her
to
say
something
pope
tried
a
nebulous
joke
about
groaning
boards
of
frisky
hanger
and
only
wintersloan
restrained
his
astonishment
and
admiration
you
could
have
got
those
chaps
in
livery
he
said
unheeded
the
lunch
was
as
a
matter
of
fact
his
idea
he
had
refused
to
come
unless
it
was
provided
and
he
had
somehow
counted
on
blue
coats
brass
buttons
and
yellow
waistcoats
but
everybody
else
of
course
ascribed
the
whole
invention
to
mr
magnet
well
said
pope
with
a
fine
air
of
epigram
the
only
thing
i
can
say
is
to
eat
it
and
prepared
to
sit
down
melon
cried
mr
magnet
to
the
waiters
we
begin
with
the
melon
have
you
ever
tried
melon
with
pepper
and
salt
mrs
pope
you
put
salt
in
everything
admired
pope
salt
from
those
attics
of
yours
attic
salt
or
there
ginger
said
mr
magnet
after
a
whisper
from
the
waiter
pope
said
something
classical
about
ginger
hot
in
the
mouth
some
of
these
days
said
wintersloan
when
i
have
exhausted
all
other
sensations
i
mean
to
try
melon
and
mustard
rom
made
a
wonderful
face
at
him
i
can
think
of
worse
things
than
that
said
wintersloan
with
a
hard
brightness
not
till
after
lunch
mr
wintersloan
said
rom
heartily
the
claret
cup
all
right
for
theodore
pope
said
magnet
a
special
twelve
year
old
brand
he
thought
of
everything
mummy
said
pope
you
better
carve
this
pie
i
think
i
want
very
much
said
mr
magnet
in
marjorie
ear
and
very
confidentially
to
show
you
the
view
from
the
church
tower
i
think
it
will
appeal
to
you
rom
said
theodore
uncontrollably
in
a
tremendous
stage
whisper
there
peaches
on
the
hamper
champagne
said
the
waiter
suddenly
in
pope
ear
wiping
from
the
bottle
but
what
could
it
have
cost
him
marjorie
would
have
preferred
that
mr
magnet
should
not
have
decided
with
such
relentless
determination
to
make
his
second
proposal
on
the
church
tower
his
purpose
was
luminously
clear
to
her
from
the
beginning
of
lunch
onward
and
she
could
feel
her
nerves
going
under
the
strain
of
that
long
expectation
she
tried
to
pull
herself
together
tried
not
to
think
about
it
tried
to
be
amused
by
the
high
spirits
and
nonsense
of
wintersloan
and
syd
and
rom
and
theodore
but
mr
magnet
was
very
pervasive
and
her
mother
did
ever
look
at
her
looked
past
her
and
away
from
her
and
all
round
her
in
a
profoundly
observant
manner
marjorie
felt
chiefly
anxious
to
get
to
the
top
of
that
predestinate
tower
and
have
the
whole
thing
over
and
it
was
with
a
start
that
she
was
just
able
to
prevent
one
of
the
assiduous
waiters
filling
her
glass
with
champagne
for
the
third
time
there
was
a
little
awkwardness
in
dispersing
after
lunch
pope
his
heart
warmed
by
the
champagne
and
mellowed
by
a
subsequent
excellent
cigar
wanted
very
much
to
crack
what
he
called
a
postprandial
jest
or
so
with
the
great
humorist
while
theodore
also
deeply
impressed
with
the
discovery
that
there
was
more
in
mr
magnet
than
he
had
supposed
displayed
a
strong
disposition
to
attach
himself
more
closely
than
he
had
hitherto
done
to
this
remarkable
person
and
study
his
quiet
but
enormous
possibilities
with
greater
attention
pope
with
a
still
alertness
did
her
best
to
get
people
adjusted
but
syd
and
rom
had
conceived
a
base
and
unnatural
desire
to
subjugate
the
affections
of
the
youngest
waiter
and
would
listen
to
her
proposal
that
they
should
take
theodore
away
into
the
town
wintersloan
displayed
extraordinary
cunning
and
resource
in
evading
a
with
pope
that
would
have
released
mr
magnet
now
pope
came
to
think
of
it
wintersloan
never
had
had
the
delights
of
a
good
talk
with
pope
he
knew
practically
nothing
about
the
east
purblow
experiment
except
for
what
mr
magnet
might
have
retailed
to
him
and
she
was
very
greatly
puzzled
to
account
for
his
almost
manifest
reluctance
to
go
into
things
thoroughly
daffy
remained
on
hand
available
but
useless
and
pope
smiling
at
the
landscape
and
a
prey
to
management
within
was
suddenly
inspired
to
take
her
eldest
daughter
into
her
confidence
daffy
she
said
with
a
guileful
finger
extended
and
pointing
to
the
lower
sky
as
though
she
was
pointing
out
the
less
obvious
and
more
atmospheric
beauties
of
surrey
get
theodore
away
from
mr
magnet
if
you
can
he
wants
to
talk
to
marjorie
daffy
looked
round
shall
i
call
him
she
said
no
said
pope
do
it
just
quietly
i
try
said
daffy
and
stared
at
her
task
and
pope
feeling
that
this
might
or
might
not
succeed
but
that
anyhow
she
had
done
what
she
could
strolled
across
to
her
husband
and
laid
a
connubial
touch
upon
his
shoulder
all
the
young
people
she
said
are
burning
to
climb
the
church
tower
i
never
understand
this
activity
after
lunch
not
me
said
pope
eh
magnet
game
said
theodore
come
along
mr
magnet
i
think
said
mr
magnet
looking
at
marjorie
i
shall
go
up
i
want
to
show
marjorie
the
view
we
stay
here
mummy
eh
said
pope
with
a
quite
unusual
geniality
and
suddenly
put
his
arm
round
pope
waist
her
motherly
eye
sought
daffy
and
indicated
her
mission
i
come
with
you
theodore
said
daffy
there
is
room
for
everyone
at
once
up
that
tower
i
go
with
mr
magnet
said
theodore
relying
firmly
on
the
privileges
of
the
day
for
a
time
they
played
for
position
with
the
intentions
of
mr
magnet
showing
more
and
more
starkly
through
the
moves
of
the
game
at
last
theodore
was
lured
down
a
side
street
by
the
sight
of
a
huge
dummy
fish
dangling
outside
a
tackle
and
bait
shop
and
mr
magnet
and
marjorie
already
with
a
dreadful
feeling
of
complicity
made
a
movement
so
rapid
it
seemed
to
her
almost
a
bolt
for
the
church
tower
whatever
mr
magnet
desired
to
say
and
whatever
elasticity
his
mind
had
once
possessed
with
regard
to
it
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
it
had
now
become
so
rigid
as
to
be
sayable
only
in
that
one
precise
position
and
in
the
exact
order
he
had
determined
upon
but
when
at
last
they
got
to
that
high
serenity
mr
magnet
was
far
too
hot
and
far
too
much
out
of
breath
to
say
anything
at
all
for
a
time
except
an
almost
explosive
gust
or
so
of
approbation
of
the
scenery
shor
breath
he
said
stairs
always
that
on
me
buful
sceny
suwy
like
it
always
marjorie
found
herself
violently
disposed
to
laugh
indeed
she
had
never
before
been
so
near
the
verge
of
hysterics
it
a
perfectly
lovely
view
she
said
no
wonder
you
wanted
me
to
see
it
naturally
said
mr
magnet
wanted
you
to
see
it
marjorie
with
a
skill
her
mother
might
have
envied
wriggled
into
a
position
in
an
embrasure
and
concentrated
herself
upon
the
broad
wooded
undulations
that
went
about
the
horizon
and
mr
magnet
mopped
his
face
with
surreptitious
gestures
and
took
deep
restoring
breaths
i
always
wanted
to
bring
you
here
he
said
ever
since
i
found
it
in
the
spring
it
was
very
kind
of
you
mr
magnet
said
marjorie
you
see
he
explained
whenever
i
see
anything
fine
or
rich
or
splendid
or
beautiful
now
i
seem
to
want
it
for
you
his
voice
quickened
as
though
he
were
repeating
something
that
had
been
long
in
his
mind
i
wish
i
could
give
you
all
this
country
i
wish
i
could
put
all
that
is
beautiful
in
the
world
at
your
feet
he
watched
the
effect
of
this
upon
her
for
a
moment
marjorie
he
said
did
you
really
mean
what
you
told
me
the
other
day
that
there
was
indeed
no
hope
for
me
i
have
a
sort
of
feeling
i
bothered
you
that
day
that
perhaps
you
did
mean
all
he
stopped
short
i
do
think
i
knew
what
i
meant
said
marjorie
and
magnet
gave
a
queer
sound
of
relief
at
her
words
i
do
think
i
know
what
i
mean
now
i
do
think
i
can
say
i
love
you
mr
magnet
i
would
if
i
could
i
like
you
very
much
indeed
i
think
you
are
awfully
kind
you
more
kind
and
generous
than
anyone
i
have
ever
known
saying
he
was
kind
and
generous
made
her
through
some
obscure
association
of
ideas
feel
that
he
must
have
understanding
she
had
an
impulse
to
put
her
whole
case
before
him
frankly
i
wonder
she
said
if
you
can
understand
what
it
is
to
be
a
girl
then
she
saw
the
absurdity
of
her
idea
of
any
such
miracle
of
sympathy
he
was
entirely
concentrated
upon
the
appeal
he
had
come
prepared
to
make
marjorie
he
said
i
do
ask
you
to
love
me
yet
all
i
ask
is
that
you
should
decide
to
love
me
marjorie
became
aware
of
theodore
hotly
followed
by
daffy
in
the
churchyard
below
i
he
up
there
theodore
was
manifestly
saying
marjorie
faced
her
lover
gravely
mr
magnet
she
said
i
will
certainly
promise
you
that
i
would
rather
be
your
servant
rather
live
for
your
happiness
than
do
anything
else
in
all
the
world
said
mr
magnet
if
you
would
trust
your
life
to
me
if
you
would
deign
he
paused
to
recover
his
thread
if
you
would
deign
to
let
me
make
life
what
it
should
be
for
you
take
every
care
from
your
shoulders
face
every
responsibility
marjorie
felt
she
had
to
hurry
she
could
almost
feel
the
feet
of
theodore
coming
up
that
tower
mr
magnet
she
said
you
do
understand
you
do
realize
what
i
am
you
do
know
how
unworthy
i
am
what
a
mere
ignorant
child
let
me
be
judge
of
that
cried
mr
magnet
they
paused
almost
like
two
actors
who
listen
for
the
prompter
it
was
only
too
obvious
that
both
were
aware
of
a
little
medley
of
imperfectly
subdued
noises
below
theodore
had
got
to
the
ladder
that
made
the
last
part
of
the
ascent
and
there
daffy
had
collared
him
birthday
said
theodore
come
down
you
go
up
there
said
daffy
you
theodore
why
not
there
was
something
like
a
scuffle
and
whispers
then
it
would
seem
theodore
went
reluctantly
and
with
protests
but
the
conflict
receded
marjorie
said
mr
magnet
as
though
there
had
been
no
pause
if
you
would
consent
only
to
make
an
experiment
if
you
would
try
to
love
me
suppose
you
an
engagement
i
do
not
care
how
long
i
waited
he
paused
will
you
try
he
urged
upon
her
distressed
silence
she
felt
as
though
she
forced
the
word
she
said
in
a
very
low
voice
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
mr
magnet
leapt
upon
her
she
felt
herself
pulled
almost
roughly
from
the
embrasure
and
he
had
kissed
her
she
struggled
in
his
embrace
mr
magnet
she
said
he
lifted
her
face
and
kissed
her
lips
marjorie
he
said
and
she
had
partly
released
herself
oh
kiss
me
she
cried
do
kiss
me
yet
but
a
kiss
i
do
like
it
i
beg
your
pardon
he
said
i
forgot
but
you
you
i
could
help
it
she
was
suddenly
wildly
sorry
for
what
she
had
done
she
felt
she
was
going
to
cry
to
behave
absurdly
i
want
to
go
down
she
said
marjorie
you
have
made
me
the
happiest
of
men
all
my
life
all
my
strength
i
will
spend
in
showing
you
that
you
have
made
no
mistake
in
trusting
me
yes
she
said
yes
and
wondered
what
she
could
say
or
do
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
shrinking
pose
was
the
most
tenderly
modest
thing
he
had
ever
seen
oh
my
dear
he
said
and
restrained
himself
and
took
her
passive
hand
and
kissed
it
i
want
to
go
down
to
them
she
insisted
he
paused
on
the
topmost
rungs
of
the
ladder
looking
unspeakable
things
at
her
then
he
turned
to
go
down
and
for
the
second
time
in
her
life
she
saw
that
incipient
thinness
i
am
sure
you
will
never
be
sorry
he
said
they
found
and
pope
in
the
churchyard
pope
was
reading
with
amusement
for
the
third
time
an
epitaph
that
had
caught
his
fancy
lands
ever
bright
days
ever
fair
and
yet
we
weep
that
is
there
he
read
you
know
that
really
good
that
ought
to
be
printed
somewhere
pope
glanced
sharply
at
her
daughter
white
face
and
found
an
enigma
then
she
looked
at
mr
magnet
there
was
no
mistake
about
mr
magnet
marjorie
had
accepted
him
whatever
else
she
had
felt
or
done
marjorie
feelings
for
the
rest
of
the
day
are
only
to
be
accounted
for
on
the
supposition
that
she
was
overwrought
she
had
a
preposterous
reaction
she
had
done
this
thing
with
her
eyes
open
after
days
of
deliberation
and
now
she
felt
as
though
she
was
caught
in
a
trap
the
clearest
thing
in
her
mind
was
that
mr
magnet
had
taken
hold
of
her
and
kissed
her
kissed
her
on
the
lips
and
that
presently
he
would
do
it
again
and
also
she
was
asking
herself
with
futile
reiteration
why
she
had
got
into
debt
at
oxbridge
why
she
had
got
into
debt
for
such
silly
little
things
too
nothing
definite
was
said
in
her
hearing
about
the
engagement
but
everybody
seemed
to
understand
pope
was
the
most
demonstrative
he
took
occasion
to
rap
her
hard
upon
the
back
his
face
crinkled
with
a
resolute
kindliness
ah
he
said
sly
maggots
he
also
administered
several
resounding
blows
to
magnet
shoulder
blades
and
irradiated
the
party
with
a
glow
of
benevolent
waggery
marjorie
submitted
without
an
answer
to
these
paternal
intimations
pope
did
no
more
than
watch
her
daughter
invisible
but
overwhelming
forces
were
busy
in
bringing
marjorie
and
her
glowing
lover
alone
together
again
it
happened
at
last
as
he
was
departing
she
was
almost
to
her
inflamed
imagination
thrust
out
upon
him
had
to
take
him
to
the
gate
and
there
in
the
shadows
of
the
trees
he
kissed
her
good
night
with
passionate
effusion
madge
he
said
madge
she
made
no
answer
she
submitted
passively
to
his
embrace
and
then
suddenly
and
dexterously
disengaged
herself
from
him
ran
in
and
without
saying
to
anyone
went
to
her
room
to
bed
pope
was
greatly
amused
by
this
departure
from
the
customary
routine
of
life
and
noted
it
archly
when
daffy
came
up
marjorie
was
ostentatiously
going
to
sleep
as
she
herself
was
dropping
off
daffy
became
aware
of
an
odd
sound
somehow
familiar
and
yet
surprising
and
disconcerting
suddenly
wide
awake
again
she
started
up
yes
there
was
no
mistake
about
it
and
yet
it
was
very
odd
madge
what
up
no
answer
i
say
you
are
crying
madge
are
you
then
after
a
long
interval
an
answer
came
in
a
muffled
voice
almost
as
if
marjorie
had
something
in
her
mouth
oh
shut
it
old
daffy
but
madge
said
daffy
after
reflection
shut
it
shut
it
leave
me
alone
i
say
ca
you
leave
me
alone
oh
and
for
a
moment
she
let
her
sobs
have
way
with
her
daffy
worry
me
old
daffy
daffy
sat
up
for
a
long
time
in
the
stifled
silence
that
ensued
and
then
like
a
sensible
sister
gave
it
up
and
composed
herself
again
to
slumber
outside
watching
the
window
in
a
state
of
nebulous
ecstasy
was
mr
magnet
moonlit
and
dewy
it
was
a
high
serene
night
with
a
growing
moon
and
a
scattered
company
of
major
stars
and
if
no
choir
of
nightingales
sang
there
was
at
least
a
very
active
nightjar
more
than
i
hoped
whispered
mr
magnet
more
than
i
dared
to
hope
he
was
very
sleepy
but
it
seemed
to
him
improper
to
go
to
bed
on
such
a
night
on
such
an
occasion
chapter
the
third
the
man
who
fell
out
of
the
sky
for
the
next
week
marjorie
became
more
nearly
introspective
than
she
had
ever
been
in
her
life
before
she
began
to
doubt
her
hitherto
unshaken
conviction
that
she
was
a
single
consistent
human
being
she
found
such
discords
and
discrepancies
between
mood
and
mood
between
the
conviction
of
this
hour
and
the
feeling
of
that
that
it
seemed
to
her
she
was
rather
a
collection
of
samples
of
emotion
and
attitude
than
anything
so
simple
as
an
individual
for
example
there
can
be
no
denying
there
was
one
marjorie
in
the
bundle
who
was
immensely
set
up
by
the
fact
that
she
was
engaged
and
going
to
be
at
no
very
remote
date
mistress
of
a
london
house
she
was
profoundly
plessingtonian
and
quite
the
vulgarest
of
the
lot
the
new
status
she
had
attained
and
the
possibly
beautiful
house
and
the
probably
successful
and
the
arrangements
and
the
importance
of
such
a
life
was
the
substance
of
this
creature
thought
she
designed
some
queenly
dresses
this
was
the
marjorie
most
in
evidence
when
it
came
to
talking
with
her
mother
and
daphne
i
am
afraid
she
patronized
daphne
and
ignored
the
fact
that
daphne
who
had
begun
with
a
resolute
magnanimity
was
becoming
annoyed
and
resentful
and
she
thought
of
things
she
might
buy
and
the
jolly
feeling
of
putting
them
about
and
making
fine
effects
with
them
one
thing
she
told
daphne
she
had
clearly
resolved
upon
the
house
should
be
always
full
and
brimming
over
with
beautiful
flowers
i
always
wished
mother
would
have
more
flowers
and
not
keep
them
so
long
when
she
has
them
another
marjorie
in
the
confusion
of
her
mind
was
doing
her
sincerest
narrow
best
to
appreciate
and
feel
grateful
for
and
return
the
devotion
of
mr
magnet
this
marjorie
accepted
and
even
elaborated
his
views
laid
stress
on
his
voluntary
subjection
harped
upon
his
goodness
brought
her
to
kiss
him
i
do
deserve
all
this
love
this
side
of
marjorie
told
magnet
but
i
mean
to
learn
to
love
you
my
dear
one
cried
magnet
and
pressed
her
hand
a
third
marjorie
among
the
many
was
an
altogether
acuter
and
less
agreeable
person
she
was
a
sprite
of
pure
criticism
and
in
spite
of
the
utmost
efforts
to
suppress
her
she
declared
night
and
day
in
the
inner
confidences
of
marjorie
soul
that
she
did
not
believe
in
mr
magnet
old
devotion
at
all
she
was
a
persistent
insurgent
she
was
dreadfully
unsettling
it
was
surely
this
marjorie
that
would
let
the
fact
of
his
baldness
alone
and
who
discovered
and
insisted
upon
a
curious
unbeautiful
flatness
in
his
voice
whenever
he
was
doing
his
best
to
speak
from
the
heart
and
as
for
this
devotion
what
did
it
amount
to
a
persistent
unimaginative
besetting
of
marjorie
a
growing
air
of
ownership
an
expansive
indulgent
smiling
disposition
to
thwart
and
control
and
he
was
always
touching
her
whenever
he
came
near
her
she
would
wince
at
the
freedoms
a
large
kind
hand
might
take
with
her
elbow
or
wrist
at
a
possible
sudden
clumsy
pat
at
some
erring
strand
of
hair
then
there
was
an
appraising
satisfaction
in
his
eye
on
the
third
day
of
their
engagement
he
began
quite
abruptly
to
call
her
magsy
we
end
this
scandal
of
a
girl
pope
he
said
magsy
magnet
you
be
no
women
for
magsy
she
became
acutely
critical
of
his
intellectual
quality
she
listened
with
a
new
alertness
to
the
conversations
at
the
the
bouts
of
wit
with
her
father
she
carried
off
utterances
and
witticism
for
maturer
reflection
she
was
amazed
to
find
how
little
they
could
withstand
the
tests
and
acids
of
her
mind
so
many
things
such
wide
and
interesting
fields
he
did
not
so
much
think
about
as
cover
with
a
large
enveloping
shallowness
he
came
strolling
around
the
vicarage
into
the
garden
one
morning
about
eleven
though
she
had
not
expected
him
until
and
she
was
sitting
with
her
feet
tucked
up
on
the
aged
but
still
practicable
reading
shaw
common
sense
of
municipal
trading
he
came
and
leant
over
the
back
of
the
seat
and
she
looked
up
said
good
morning
is
it
perfectly
lovely
and
indicated
by
a
book
still
open
that
her
interest
in
it
remained
alive
what
the
book
magsy
he
asked
took
it
out
of
her
slightly
resisting
hand
closed
it
and
read
the
title
um
he
said
is
this
a
bit
stiff
for
little
women
brains
all
the
rebel
marjories
were
up
in
arms
at
that
dreadful
word
i
like
it
he
shook
his
head
with
a
grimace
of
humorous
distaste
i
suppose
women
have
as
good
brains
as
men
said
marjorie
if
it
comes
to
that
better
said
magnet
that
why
they
should
trouble
about
horrid
things
like
municipal
and
trading
on
a
day
like
this
do
you
think
this
sort
of
thing
is
interesting
oh
he
said
and
flourished
the
book
come
and
besides
he
makes
a
very
good
case
but
he
such
a
mountebank
does
that
matter
he
is
a
mountebank
there
he
not
sincere
i
doubt
if
you
had
a
serious
book
on
municipal
trading
magsy
whether
you
make
head
or
tail
of
it
it
a
stiff
subject
shaw
just
gets
his
chance
for
a
smart
thing
or
so
rather
you
read
a
good
novel
he
really
had
the
air
of
taking
her
reading
in
hand
you
think
i
ought
not
to
read
an
intelligent
book
i
think
we
ought
to
leave
those
things
to
the
people
who
understand
but
we
ought
to
understand
he
smiled
wisely
there
a
lot
of
things
have
to
understand
he
said
nearer
home
than
this
marjorie
was
ablaze
now
what
a
silly
thing
to
say
she
cried
with
an
undergraduate
freedom
really
you
are
talking
nonsense
i
read
that
book
because
it
interests
me
if
i
did
i
should
read
something
else
do
you
mean
to
suggest
that
i
reading
like
a
child
who
holds
a
book
upside
down
she
was
so
plainly
angry
that
he
was
taken
aback
i
do
mean
to
suggest
he
began
and
turned
to
greet
the
welcome
presence
the
interrogative
eye
of
pope
here
we
are
he
said
having
a
quarrel
marjorie
said
pope
oh
it
serious
said
mr
magnet
and
added
with
a
gleam
it
about
municipal
trading
pope
knew
the
wicked
little
flicker
in
marjorie
eye
better
than
mr
magnet
she
had
known
it
from
the
nursery
and
yet
she
had
never
quite
mastered
its
meaning
she
had
never
yet
realized
it
was
marjorie
she
had
always
regarded
it
as
something
marjorie
some
other
marjorie
ought
to
keep
under
control
so
now
she
adopted
a
pacificatory
tone
oh
lovers
quarrels
she
said
floating
over
the
occasion
quarrels
you
must
ask
to
interfere
marjorie
already
a
little
ashamed
of
her
heat
thought
for
an
instant
she
ought
to
stand
that
and
then
decided
abruptly
with
a
return
to
choler
that
she
would
not
do
so
she
stood
up
and
held
out
her
hand
for
her
book
mr
magnet
she
said
to
her
mother
with
remarkable
force
and
freedom
as
she
took
it
has
been
talking
unutterable
nonsense
i
do
call
that
a
lovers
quarrel
anyhow
then
confronted
with
a
double
astonishment
and
having
no
more
to
say
she
picked
up
her
skirt
quite
unnecessarily
and
walked
with
a
heavenward
chin
indoors
i
afraid
explained
mr
magnet
i
was
a
little
too
free
with
one
of
magsy
favourite
authors
which
is
the
favourite
author
now
asked
pope
after
a
reflective
pause
with
a
mother
indulgent
smile
shaw
he
raised
amused
eyebrows
it
just
the
age
i
suppose
she
frightfully
loyal
while
it
lasts
said
pope
no
one
dare
say
a
word
against
them
i
think
it
adorable
of
her
said
mr
magnet
with
an
answering
loyalty
and
gusto
the
aviation
accident
occurred
while
pope
her
two
eldest
daughters
and
mr
magnet
were
playing
upon
the
vicarage
lawn
it
was
a
serene
hot
afternoon
a
little
too
hot
to
take
a
game
seriously
and
the
four
little
figures
moved
slowly
over
the
green
and
grouped
and
dispersed
as
the
game
required
mr
magnet
was
very
fond
of
he
displayed
a
whimsical
humour
and
much
invention
at
this
game
it
was
not
too
exacting
physically
and
he
could
make
his
ball
jump
into
the
air
in
the
absurdest
manner
occasionally
he
won
a
laugh
from
marjorie
or
daffy
no
one
else
was
in
sight
the
and
theodore
and
toupee
were
in
the
barn
and
pope
was
six
miles
away
at
wamping
lying
prone
nibbling
grass
blades
and
watching
a
county
cricket
match
as
every
good
englishman
who
knows
what
is
expected
of
him
loves
to
do
click
went
ball
and
mallet
and
then
after
a
long
interval
click
it
seemed
incredible
that
anything
could
possibly
happen
before
tea
but
this
is
no
longer
the
world
it
was
suddenly
this
tranquil
scene
was
slashed
and
rent
by
the
sound
and
vision
of
a
monoplane
tearing
across
the
heavens
a
purring
and
popping
arrested
mr
magnet
in
mid
jest
and
the
monster
came
sliding
up
the
sky
over
the
trees
beside
the
church
to
the
east
already
near
enough
to
look
big
a
great
stiff
shape
big
buff
sails
stayed
with
glittering
wire
and
with
two
odd
little
wheels
beneath
its
body
it
drove
up
the
sky
rising
with
a
sort
of
upward
heaving
until
the
croquet
players
could
see
the
driver
and
a
passenger
perched
behind
him
quite
clearly
it
passed
a
little
to
the
right
of
the
church
tower
and
only
a
few
yards
above
the
level
of
the
flagstaff
there
fifty
feet
of
clearance
altogether
and
as
it
did
so
marjorie
could
see
both
driver
and
passenger
making
hasty
movements
it
became
immense
and
and
every
one
stood
rigid
as
it
swept
across
the
sun
above
the
vicarage
chimneys
then
it
seemed
to
drop
twenty
feet
or
so
abruptly
and
then
both
the
men
cried
out
as
it
drove
straight
for
the
line
of
poplars
between
the
shrubbery
and
the
meadow
oh
oh
oh
cried
pope
and
daffy
evidently
the
aviator
was
trying
to
turn
sharply
the
huge
thing
banked
but
not
enough
and
came
about
and
slipped
away
until
its
wing
was
slashing
into
the
tree
tops
with
a
thrilling
swish
of
leaves
and
the
snapping
of
branches
and
stays
run
cried
magnet
and
danced
about
the
lawn
and
the
three
ladies
rushed
sideways
as
the
whole
affair
slouched
down
on
them
it
came
on
its
edge
hesitated
whether
to
turn
over
as
a
whole
then
crumpled
and
amidst
a
volley
of
smashing
and
snapping
came
to
rest
amidst
turf
a
clamorous
stench
of
petrol
and
a
cloud
of
dust
and
blue
smoke
within
twenty
yards
of
them
the
two
men
had
jumped
to
clear
the
engine
had
fallen
headlong
and
were
now
both
covered
by
the
fabric
of
the
shattered
wing
it
was
all
too
spectacular
for
word
or
speech
until
the
thing
lay
still
even
then
the
croquet
players
stood
passive
for
awhile
waiting
for
something
to
happen
it
took
some
seconds
to
reconcile
their
minds
to
this
sudden
loss
of
initiative
in
a
monster
that
had
been
so
recently
and
threateningly
full
of
go
it
seemed
quite
a
long
time
before
it
came
into
marjorie
head
that
she
ought
perhaps
to
act
in
some
way
she
saw
a
tall
young
man
wriggling
on
all
fours
from
underneath
the
wreckage
of
fabric
he
stared
at
her
rather
blankly
she
went
forward
with
a
vague
idea
of
helping
him
he
stood
up
swayed
doubtfully
on
his
legs
turned
and
became
energetic
struggling
mysteriously
with
the
edge
of
the
left
wing
he
gasped
and
turned
fierce
blue
eyes
over
his
shoulder
help
me
to
hold
the
confounded
thing
up
he
cried
with
a
touch
of
irritation
in
his
voice
at
her
attitude
marjorie
at
once
seized
the
edge
of
the
plane
and
pushed
the
second
man
in
a
peculiar
was
lying
crumpled
up
underneath
his
ear
and
cheek
were
bright
with
blood
and
there
was
a
streak
of
blood
on
the
ground
near
his
head
that
right
can
you
hold
it
if
i
use
only
one
hand
marjorie
gasped
yes
with
a
terrific
weight
as
it
seemed
suddenly
on
her
wrists
right
o
and
the
tall
young
man
had
thrust
himself
backwards
under
the
plane
until
it
rested
on
his
back
and
collared
the
prostrate
man
keep
it
up
he
said
fiercely
when
marjorie
threatened
to
give
way
he
seemed
to
assume
that
she
was
there
to
obey
orders
and
with
much
grunting
and
effort
he
had
dragged
his
companion
clear
of
the
wreckage
the
man
face
was
a
mass
of
blood
and
he
was
sickeningly
inert
to
his
companion
lugging
let
it
go
said
the
tall
young
man
and
marjorie
thanked
heaven
as
the
broken
wing
flapped
down
again
she
came
helpfully
to
his
side
and
became
aware
of
daffy
and
her
mother
a
few
paces
off
magnet
it
astonished
her
was
retreating
hastily
but
he
had
to
go
away
because
the
sight
of
blood
upset
him
so
much
that
it
was
always
wiser
for
him
to
go
away
is
he
hurt
cried
pope
we
both
are
said
the
tall
young
man
and
then
as
though
these
other
people
did
matter
and
he
and
marjorie
were
old
friends
he
said
can
we
turn
him
over
i
think
so
marjorie
grasped
the
damaged
man
shoulder
and
got
him
over
skilfully
will
you
get
some
water
said
the
tall
young
man
to
daffy
and
pope
in
a
way
that
sent
daffy
off
at
once
for
a
pail
he
wants
water
she
said
to
the
parlourmaid
who
was
hurrying
out
of
the
house
the
tall
young
man
had
gone
down
on
his
knees
by
his
companion
releasing
his
neck
and
making
a
hasty
first
examination
of
his
condition
the
pneumatic
cap
must
have
saved
his
head
he
said
throwing
the
thing
aside
lucky
he
had
it
he
ca
be
badly
hurt
just
rubbed
his
face
along
the
ground
silly
thing
to
have
come
as
we
did
he
felt
the
heart
and
tried
the
flexibility
of
an
arm
all
right
he
said
he
became
judicial
and
absorbed
over
the
problems
of
his
friend
side
um
he
remarked
he
knelt
back
and
regarded
marjorie
for
the
first
time
thundering
smash
he
said
his
face
relaxed
into
an
agreeable
smile
he
only
bought
it
last
week
is
he
hurt
rib
i
think
or
two
ribs
perhaps
stunned
rather
all
just
his
nose
he
regarded
marjorie
and
marjorie
him
for
a
brief
space
he
became
aware
of
pope
on
his
right
hand
then
at
a
clank
behind
he
turned
round
to
see
daphne
advancing
with
a
pail
of
water
the
two
servants
were
now
on
the
spot
and
the
man
and
the
old
lady
who
did
out
the
church
and
magnet
hovered
doubtfully
in
the
distance
suddenly
with
shouts
and
barks
of
sympathetic
glee
the
theodore
and
toupee
shot
out
of
the
house
new
thoughts
were
stirring
in
the
young
aviator
he
rose
wincing
a
little
as
he
did
so
i
afraid
i
a
little
rude
he
said
i
do
hope
your
friend
is
hurt
said
pope
feeling
the
duty
of
a
hostess
he
not
hurt
so
far
as
i
can
see
have
we
made
rather
a
mess
of
your
lawn
oh
not
at
all
said
pope
we
have
if
that
is
your
gardener
over
there
it
would
be
nice
if
he
kept
back
the
people
who
seem
to
be
hesitating
beyond
those
trees
there
will
be
more
presently
i
afraid
i
must
throw
myself
on
your
hands
he
broke
into
a
chuckle
for
a
moment
i
have
you
know
is
it
possible
to
get
a
doctor
my
friend
not
hurt
so
very
much
but
still
he
wants
expert
handling
he
sir
rupert
solomonson
from
he
jerked
his
head
back
over
beyond
tunbridge
wells
my
name
trafford
i
pope
and
these
are
my
daughters
trafford
bowed
we
just
took
the
thing
out
for
a
lark
he
said
marjorie
had
been
regarding
the
prostrate
man
his
mouth
was
a
little
open
and
he
showed
beautiful
teeth
apart
from
the
dry
blood
upon
him
he
was
not
an
man
he
was
manifestly
a
jew
a
jew
you
have
remarked
of
course
that
there
are
jews
whose
noses
are
within
bounds
and
jews
whose
noses
are
with
not
so
much
a
as
a
cropped
like
the
head
of
a
capuchin
monkey
suddenly
she
was
down
and
had
his
head
on
her
knee
with
a
quick
movement
that
caught
trafford
eye
better
she
said
his
eyelids
flickered
daffy
bring
the
water
she
had
felt
a
queer
little
repugnance
at
first
with
this
helpless
man
but
now
that
professional
nurse
who
lurks
in
the
composition
of
so
many
women
was
uppermost
give
me
your
handkerchief
she
said
to
trafford
and
with
daffy
kneeling
beside
her
and
also
interested
and
pope
a
belated
but
more
experienced
and
authoritative
third
sir
rupert
was
soon
getting
the
best
of
attention
wathall
said
sir
rupert
suddenly
and
tried
again
wathall
a
third
effort
gave
wathall
about
eh
if
we
could
get
him
into
the
shade
said
marjorie
woosh
cried
sir
rupert
weeeooo
that
all
right
said
trafford
it
only
a
rib
or
two
eeeeeyoooo
said
sir
rupert
exactly
we
going
to
carry
you
out
of
the
glare
do
touch
me
said
sir
rupert
gooo
it
took
some
little
persuasion
before
sir
rupert
would
consent
to
be
moved
and
even
then
he
was
for
a
time
oh
crusty
but
presently
trafford
and
the
two
girls
had
got
him
into
the
shade
of
a
large
bush
close
to
where
in
a
circle
of
rugs
and
cushions
the
tea
things
lay
prepared
there
they
camped
the
helpful
man
was
ordered
to
stave
off
intruders
from
the
village
water
towels
pillows
were
forthcoming
mr
magnet
reappeared
as
tentative
assistance
and
solomonson
became
articulate
and
brave
and
said
he
nothing
but
a
stitch
in
his
side
in
his
present
position
he
was
at
all
uncomfortable
only
he
did
want
any
one
near
him
he
enforced
that
by
an
appealing
smile
the
twins
invited
to
fetch
the
doctor
declined
proffering
theodore
they
had
conceived
juvenile
passions
for
the
tall
young
man
and
did
not
want
to
leave
him
he
certainly
had
a
very
nice
face
so
theodore
after
walking
twice
round
the
wreckage
tore
himself
away
and
departed
on
rom
bicycle
enquiry
centred
on
solomonson
for
a
time
his
face
hair
and
neck
were
wet
but
no
longer
bloody
and
he
professed
perfect
comfort
so
long
as
he
was
moved
and
no
one
came
too
near
him
he
was
very
clear
about
that
though
perfectly
polite
and
scrutinized
their
faces
to
see
if
they
were
equally
clear
satisfied
upon
this
point
he
closed
his
eyes
and
spoke
no
more
he
looked
then
like
a
capuchin
monkey
lost
in
pride
there
came
a
pause
every
one
was
conscious
of
having
risen
to
an
emergency
and
behaved
well
under
unusual
circumstances
the
young
man
eye
rested
on
the
adjacent
lacking
nothing
but
the
coronation
of
the
teapot
why
not
he
remarked
have
tea
if
you
think
your
friend
began
pope
oh
all
right
are
you
solomonson
there
nothing
more
now
until
the
doctor
only
want
to
be
left
alone
said
solomonson
and
closed
his
heavy
eyelids
again
pope
told
the
maids
with
an
air
of
dismissal
to
get
tea
we
can
keep
an
eye
on
him
said
trafford
marjorie
surveyed
her
first
patient
with
a
pretty
unconscious
mixture
of
maternal
gravity
and
girlish
interest
and
the
twins
to
avoid
too
openly
gloating
upon
the
good
looks
of
trafford
chose
places
and
secured
cushions
round
the
calculating
to
the
best
of
their
ability
how
they
might
secure
the
closest
proximity
to
him
mr
magnet
and
toupee
had
gone
to
stare
at
the
monoplane
they
were
presently
joined
by
the
man
in
an
interrogative
mood
pretty
complete
smash
sir
said
the
man
and
then
perceiving
heads
over
the
hedge
by
the
churchyard
turned
back
to
his
duty
of
sentinel
daffy
thought
of
the
need
of
more
cups
and
plates
and
went
in
to
get
them
and
pope
remarked
that
she
did
hope
sir
rupert
was
not
badly
hurt
extraordinary
all
this
is
remarked
trafford
now
here
we
were
after
lunch
twenty
miles
away
smoking
cigars
and
with
no
more
idea
of
having
tea
with
you
than
i
was
going
to
say
flying
but
that
out
of
date
now
then
we
just
thought
we
try
the
thing
like
a
dream
he
addressed
himself
to
marjorie
i
never
feel
that
life
is
quite
real
until
about
three
days
after
things
have
happened
never
two
hours
ago
i
had
not
the
slightest
intention
of
ever
flying
again
but
have
you
flown
before
asked
pope
not
much
i
did
a
little
at
sheppey
but
it
so
hard
for
a
poor
man
to
get
his
hands
on
a
machine
and
here
was
solomonson
with
this
thing
in
his
hangar
eating
its
head
off
let
take
it
out
i
said
and
go
once
round
the
park
and
here
we
are
i
thought
it
was
wise
for
him
to
come
sir
rupert
without
opening
his
eyes
was
understood
to
assent
do
you
know
said
trafford
the
sight
of
your
tea
makes
me
feel
frightfully
hungry
i
do
think
the
engine
damaged
he
said
cheerfully
do
you
as
magnet
joined
them
the
ailerons
are
in
splinters
and
the
left
not
much
better
but
that
about
all
except
the
wheels
one
falls
so
much
lighter
than
you
might
suppose
from
the
smash
lucky
it
turn
over
then
you
know
the
engine
comes
on
the
top
of
you
and
you
done
the
doctor
arrived
after
tea
with
a
bag
and
a
stethoscope
in
a
small
box
and
the
popes
and
mr
magnet
withdrew
while
sir
rupert
was
carefully
sounded
tested
scrutinized
questioned
watched
and
examined
in
every
way
known
to
medical
science
the
outcome
of
the
conference
was
presently
communicated
to
the
popes
by
trafford
and
the
doctor
sir
rupert
was
not
very
seriously
injured
but
he
was
suffering
from
concussion
and
shock
two
of
his
ribs
were
broken
and
his
wrist
sprained
unless
perhaps
one
of
the
small
bones
was
displaced
he
ought
to
be
bandaged
up
and
put
to
bed
could
we
said
pope
but
the
doctor
assured
her
his
own
house
was
quite
the
best
place
there
sir
rupert
could
stay
for
some
days
at
present
the
journey
over
the
downs
or
by
the
south
eastern
railway
would
be
needlessly
trying
and
painful
he
would
with
the
permission
lie
quietly
where
he
was
for
an
hour
or
so
and
then
the
doctor
would
come
with
a
couple
of
men
and
a
carrying
bed
he
had
and
take
him
off
to
his
own
house
there
he
would
be
as
trafford
said
as
right
as
ninepence
and
trafford
could
put
up
either
at
the
red
lion
with
mr
magnet
or
in
the
little
cottage
next
door
to
the
doctor
trafford
elected
for
the
latter
as
closer
to
his
friend
as
for
the
smashed
aeroplane
telegrams
would
be
sent
at
once
to
sir
engineers
at
chesilbury
and
they
would
have
all
that
cleared
away
by
the
doctor
departed
sir
rupert
after
stimulants
closed
his
eyes
and
trafford
seated
himself
at
the
for
some
more
cake
as
though
introduction
by
aeroplane
was
the
most
regular
thing
in
the
world
he
had
very
pleasant
and
easy
manners
an
entire
absence
of
and
a
quick
talkative
disposition
that
made
him
very
rapidly
at
home
with
everybody
he
described
all
the
sensations
of
flight
his
early
lessons
and
experiments
and
in
the
utmost
detail
the
events
of
the
afternoon
that
had
led
to
this
disastrous
adventure
he
made
his
suggestion
of
trying
the
thing
seem
the
most
natural
impulse
in
the
world
the
bulk
of
the
conversation
fell
on
him
mr
magnet
save
for
the
intervention
of
one
or
two
jests
was
quietly
observant
the
rest
were
well
disposed
to
listen
and
as
trafford
talked
his
eye
rested
ever
and
again
on
marjorie
with
the
faintest
touch
of
scrutiny
and
perplexity
and
she
too
found
a
curious
little
persuasion
growing
up
in
her
mind
that
somewhere
somehow
she
and
he
had
met
and
had
talked
rather
earnestly
but
how
and
where
eluded
her
altogether
they
had
sat
for
an
hour
the
men
from
the
doctor
seemed
never
coming
when
pope
returned
unexpectedly
from
his
cricket
match
which
had
ended
a
little
prematurely
in
a
rot
on
an
wicket
he
was
full
of
particulars
of
the
day
play
and
how
wiper
had
got
a
most
amazing
catch
and
held
it
though
he
fell
how
jenks
had
deliberately
bowled
at
a
man
head
he
believed
and
little
gibbs
thrown
a
man
out
from
slip
he
was
burning
to
tell
all
this
in
the
utmost
detail
to
magnet
and
his
family
so
that
they
might
at
least
share
the
retrospect
of
his
pleasure
he
had
thought
out
rather
a
good
pun
on
wiper
and
he
was
naturally
a
little
thwarted
to
find
all
this
good
rich
talk
crowded
out
by
a
more
engrossing
topic
at
the
sight
of
a
stranger
grouped
in
a
popular
manner
beside
the
he
displayed
a
slight
acerbity
which
was
if
anything
increased
by
the
discovery
of
a
prostrate
person
with
large
brown
eyes
and
an
expression
of
oriental
patience
and
disdain
in
the
shade
of
a
bush
near
by
at
first
he
seemed
scarcely
to
grasp
explanations
and
regarded
sir
rupert
with
an
expression
that
bordered
on
malevolence
then
when
his
attention
was
directed
to
the
smashed
machine
upon
the
lawn
he
broke
out
into
a
loud
indignant
good
god
what
next
he
walked
towards
the
wreckage
disregarding
trafford
beside
him
a
man
ca
go
away
from
his
house
for
an
hour
he
complained
i
can
assure
you
we
did
all
we
could
to
prevent
it
said
trafford
ought
never
to
have
had
it
to
prevent
said
pope
is
your
friend
hurt
a
rib
and
shock
said
trafford
well
he
deserves
it
said
pope
rather
than
launch
myself
into
the
air
in
one
of
those
infernal
things
i
be
stood
against
a
wall
and
shot
tastes
differ
of
course
said
trafford
with
unruffled
urbanity
you
have
all
this
cleared
away
said
pope
mechanics
oh
a
complete
party
are
speeding
to
us
in
fast
motors
said
trafford
thanks
to
the
kindness
of
your
domestic
in
taking
a
telegram
for
me
hope
they
wo
kill
any
one
said
pope
and
just
for
a
moment
the
conversation
hung
fire
and
your
friend
he
asked
he
goes
in
the
next
ten
minutes
well
whenever
the
litter
comes
from
the
doctor
poor
old
solomonson
solomonson
sir
rupert
oh
said
pope
is
that
the
pigmentation
solomonson
i
believe
he
does
do
some
beastly
company
of
that
sort
said
trafford
is
it
amazing
we
did
smash
our
engine
sir
rupert
solomonson
was
indeed
a
familiar
name
to
pope
he
had
organized
the
exploitation
of
a
number
of
pigment
and
patents
and
the
ordinary
and
deferred
shares
of
his
syndicate
has
risen
to
so
high
a
price
as
to
fill
pope
with
the
utmost
confidence
in
their
future
indeed
he
had
bought
considerably
withdrawing
capital
to
do
so
from
an
argentine
railway
whose
stock
had
awakened
his
distaste
and
a
sort
of
moral
aversion
by
slumping
heavily
after
a
bad
wheat
and
linseed
harvest
this
discovery
did
much
to
mitigate
his
first
asperity
his
next
remark
to
trafford
was
almost
neutral
and
he
was
even
asking
sir
rupert
whether
he
could
do
anything
to
make
him
comfortable
when
the
doctor
returned
with
a
litter
borne
by
four
hastily
compiled
bearers
some
brightness
seemed
to
vanish
when
the
buoyant
trafford
still
undauntedly
cheerful
limped
off
after
his
more
injured
friend
and
disappeared
through
the
gate
marjorie
found
herself
in
a
world
whose
remaining
manhood
declined
to
see
anything
but
extreme
annoyance
in
this
gay
exciting
rupture
of
the
afternoon
good
god
said
pope
what
next
what
next
registration
i
hope
said
mr
magnet
and
relegation
to
the
desert
of
sahara
one
good
thing
about
it
said
pope
it
all
wastes
petrol
and
when
the
petrol
supply
gives
out
they
done
certainly
we
might
all
have
been
killed
said
pope
feeling
she
had
to
bear
her
witness
against
their
visitors
and
added
if
we
moved
out
of
the
way
that
is
there
was
a
simultaneous
movement
towards
the
shattered
apparatus
about
which
a
small
contingent
of
villagers
who
had
availed
themselves
of
the
withdrawal
of
the
sentinel
had
now
assembled
look
at
it
said
pope
with
bitter
hostility
look
at
it
everyone
had
anticipated
his
command
they
never
come
to
anything
said
pope
after
a
pause
of
silent
hatred
but
they
to
come
to
something
said
marjorie
they
come
to
smash
said
mr
magnet
with
the
true
humorist
air
but
consider
the
impudence
of
this
invasion
the
wild
objectionableness
of
it
they
nasty
things
said
mr
magnet
nasty
things
a
curious
spirit
of
opposition
stirred
in
marjorie
it
seemed
to
her
that
men
who
play
and
watch
cricket
matches
have
no
business
to
contemn
men
who
risk
their
lives
in
the
air
she
sought
for
some
controversial
opening
is
the
engine
rather
wonderful
she
remarked
mr
magnet
regarded
the
engine
with
his
head
a
little
on
one
side
the
usual
sort
he
said
there
were
engines
like
that
twenty
years
ago
there
were
people
like
twenty
years
ago
said
mr
magnet
smiling
wisely
and
kindly
and
turned
his
back
on
the
thing
pope
followed
suit
he
was
filled
with
the
bitter
thought
that
he
would
never
now
be
able
to
tell
the
history
of
the
remarkable
match
he
had
witnessed
it
was
all
spoilt
for
him
spoilt
for
ever
everything
was
disturbed
and
put
out
they
left
us
our
tennis
lawn
he
said
with
a
not
unnatural
resentment
passing
to
invitation
what
do
you
say
magnet
now
begun
the
game
you
must
keep
it
up
if
marjorie
or
pope
or
daffy
said
magnet
pope
declared
the
house
required
her
and
so
with
the
gravest
apprehensions
and
an
insincere
compliment
to
their
father
energy
daffy
and
marjorie
made
up
a
foursome
for
that
healthy
and
invigorating
game
but
that
evening
pope
got
his
serve
well
into
the
bay
of
the
sagging
net
almost
at
once
and
with
marjorie
in
the
background
taking
anything
he
left
her
he
won
quite
easily
and
everything
became
pleasant
again
magnet
gloated
upon
marjorie
and
served
her
like
a
missionary
giving
bibles
to
heathen
children
he
seemed
always
looking
at
her
instead
of
the
ball
and
except
for
a
slight
disposition
on
the
part
of
daffy
to
slash
nothing
could
have
been
more
delightful
and
at
supper
pope
rather
crushing
his
wife
attempt
to
recapitulate
the
more
characteristic
sayings
and
doings
of
sir
rupert
and
his
friend
did
after
all
succeed
in
giving
every
one
a
very
good
idea
indeed
of
the
more
remarkable
incidents
of
the
cricket
match
at
wamping
and
made
the
pun
he
had
been
accustomed
to
use
upon
the
name
of
wiper
in
a
new
and
improved
form
a
general
talk
about
cricket
and
the
immense
good
of
cricket
followed
pope
said
he
would
make
compulsory
for
every
english
boy
everyone
it
seemed
to
marjorie
was
forgetting
that
dark
shape
athwart
the
lawn
and
all
the
immense
implication
of
its
presence
with
a
deliberate
and
irrational
skill
and
she
noted
that
the
usual
move
towards
the
garden
at
the
end
of
the
evening
was
not
made
in
the
night
time
marjorie
had
a
dream
that
she
was
flying
about
in
the
world
on
a
monoplane
with
trafford
as
a
passenger
then
trafford
disappeared
and
she
was
flying
about
alone
with
a
curious
uneasy
feeling
that
in
a
minute
or
so
she
would
be
unable
any
longer
to
manage
the
machine
then
her
father
and
mr
magnet
appeared
very
far
below
walking
about
and
disapproving
of
her
mr
magnet
was
shaking
his
head
very
very
sagely
and
saying
rather
a
stiff
job
for
little
marjorie
and
her
father
was
saying
she
would
be
steadier
when
she
married
and
then
she
was
clear
how
the
engine
refused
to
work
until
her
bills
were
paid
and
she
began
to
fall
and
fall
and
fall
towards
mr
magnet
she
tried
frantically
to
pay
her
bills
she
was
falling
down
the
fronts
of
skyscrapers
and
precipices
and
mr
magnet
was
waiting
for
her
below
with
a
quiet
kindly
smile
that
grew
wider
and
wider
and
wider
she
woke
up
palpitating
next
morning
a
curious
restlessness
came
upon
marjorie
conceivably
it
was
due
to
the
absence
of
magnet
who
had
gone
to
london
to
deliver
his
long
promised
address
on
the
characteristics
of
english
humour
to
the
club
conceivably
she
missed
his
attentions
but
it
crystallized
out
in
the
early
afternoon
into
the
oddest
form
a
powerful
craving
to
go
to
the
little
town
of
pensting
five
miles
off
on
the
other
side
of
buryhamstreet
to
buy
silk
shoelaces
she
decided
to
go
in
the
donkey
cart
she
communicated
her
intention
to
her
mother
but
she
did
not
communicate
an
equally
definite
intention
to
be
reminded
suddenly
of
sir
rupert
solomonson
as
she
was
passing
the
surgery
and
make
an
inquiry
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
it
surely
be
anything
but
a
kindly
and
justifiable
impulse
to
do
that
she
might
see
trafford
perhaps
but
there
was
no
particular
harm
in
that
it
is
also
to
be
remarked
that
finding
theodore
a
little
disposed
to
encumber
her
vehicle
with
his
presence
she
expressed
her
delight
at
being
released
from
the
need
of
going
and
abandoned
the
whole
expedition
to
him
knowing
as
she
did
perfectly
well
that
if
theodore
hated
anything
more
than
navigating
the
donkey
cart
alone
it
was
going
unprotected
into
a
shop
to
buy
articles
of
feminine
apparel
until
he
chucked
the
whole
project
and
went
fishing
if
one
can
call
it
fishing
when
there
are
no
fish
and
the
fisherman
knows
it
in
the
decadent
ornamental
water
and
it
is
also
to
be
remarked
that
as
marjorie
approached
the
surgery
she
was
seized
with
an
absurd
and
powerful
shyness
so
that
not
only
did
she
not
call
at
the
surgery
she
did
not
even
look
at
the
surgery
she
gazed
almost
rigidly
straight
ahead
telling
herself
however
that
she
merely
deferred
that
kindly
impulse
until
she
had
bought
her
laces
and
so
it
happened
that
about
half
a
mile
beyond
the
end
of
buryhamstreet
she
came
round
a
corner
upon
trafford
and
by
a
singular
fatality
he
also
was
driving
a
donkey
or
rather
was
tracing
a
pattern
on
the
road
with
a
donkey
hoofs
it
was
a
very
similar
donkey
to
marjorie
but
the
vehicle
was
a
governess
cart
and
much
smarter
than
marjorie
his
ingenuous
face
displayed
great
animation
at
the
sight
of
her
and
as
she
drew
alongside
he
hailed
her
with
an
almost
unnatural
ease
of
manner
hullo
he
cried
i
taking
the
air
you
seem
to
be
able
to
drive
donkeys
forward
how
do
you
do
it
i
ca
never
done
anything
so
dangerous
in
my
life
before
i
just
been
missed
by
two
motor
cars
and
hung
for
a
terrible
minute
with
my
left
wheel
on
the
very
verge
of
an
unfathomable
ditch
i
could
hear
the
little
ducklings
far
far
below
and
bits
of
mould
dropping
i
tried
to
count
before
the
splash
you
but
why
are
you
doing
it
one
must
do
something
i
bandaged
up
and
ca
walk
it
hurt
my
leg
more
than
i
knew
your
doctor
says
solomonson
wo
talk
of
anything
but
how
he
feels
and
do
care
a
rap
how
he
feels
so
i
got
this
thing
and
came
out
with
it
marjorie
made
her
inquiries
there
came
a
little
pause
some
day
no
one
will
believe
that
men
were
ever
so
foolish
as
to
trust
themselves
to
draught
animals
he
remarked
hullo
look
out
the
horror
of
it
a
large
oil
van
a
huge
drum
on
wheels
had
come
round
the
corner
and
after
a
preliminary
and
quite
insufficient
hoot
bore
down
upon
them
and
missing
trafford
as
it
seemed
by
a
miracle
swept
past
both
drivers
did
wonderful
things
with
whips
and
reins
and
found
themselves
alone
in
the
road
again
with
their
wheels
locked
and
an
indefinite
future
i
leave
the
situation
to
you
said
trafford
or
shall
we
just
sit
and
talk
until
the
next
motor
car
kills
us
we
ought
to
make
an
effort
said
marjorie
cheerfully
and
descended
to
lead
the
two
beasts
assisted
by
an
elderly
hedger
who
had
been
taking
a
disregarded
interest
in
them
for
some
time
she
separated
the
wheels
and
got
the
two
donkeys
abreast
the
old
hedger
opinion
of
their
safety
on
the
highway
was
expressed
by
his
action
rather
than
his
words
he
directed
the
beasts
towards
a
shady
lane
that
opened
at
right
angles
to
the
road
he
stood
by
their
bridles
while
marjorie
resumed
her
seat
it
seems
to
me
clearly
a
case
for
compromise
said
trafford
you
want
to
go
that
way
i
want
to
go
that
way
let
us
both
go
way
it
is
by
such
arrangements
that
civilization
becomes
possible
he
dismissed
the
hedger
generously
and
resumed
his
reins
shall
we
race
he
asked
with
your
leg
she
inquired
no
with
the
donkeys
i
say
this
rather
a
lark
at
first
i
thought
it
was
both
dangerous
and
dull
but
things
have
changed
i
am
in
beastly
high
spirits
i
feel
there
will
be
a
cry
before
night
but
still
i
am
i
wanted
the
companionship
of
an
unbroken
person
so
jolly
to
meet
you
again
again
after
the
year
before
last
after
the
year
before
last
you
did
know
said
trafford
i
had
met
you
before
how
aggressive
i
must
have
seemed
well
was
quite
clear
i
spent
the
greater
part
of
last
night
my
ankle
being
foolish
in
the
small
hours
in
trying
to
remember
how
and
where
i
do
remember
said
marjorie
i
remembered
you
very
distinctly
and
some
things
i
thought
about
you
but
not
where
it
had
happened
then
in
the
night
i
got
it
it
a
puzzle
is
it
you
see
i
was
wearing
a
black
gown
and
i
had
been
out
of
the
sunlight
for
some
months
and
my
eye
i
remember
it
acutely
was
bandaged
i
usually
bandaged
somewhere
was
a
king
in
babylon
and
you
were
a
christian
i
mean
a
candidate
marjorie
remembered
suddenly
you
professor
trafford
not
in
this
atmosphere
but
i
am
at
the
romeike
college
and
as
soon
as
i
recalled
examining
you
i
remembered
it
minutely
you
were
intelligent
though
unsound
about
it
was
ah
you
remember
me
now
as
most
young
women
are
correct
by
rote
and
unintelligent
in
such
questions
and
as
it
does
matter
a
rap
about
anything
of
that
sort
whether
you
are
correct
or
not
as
long
as
the
mental
gesture
is
right
he
paused
for
a
moment
as
though
tired
of
his
sentence
i
remembered
you
he
proceeded
in
his
easy
and
detached
manner
that
seemed
to
make
every
topic
possible
to
tell
her
his
first
impressions
of
her
and
show
how
very
distinctly
indeed
he
remembered
her
you
set
me
philosophizing
i
never
examined
a
girls
school
before
and
i
was
suddenly
struck
by
the
spectacle
of
the
fifty
of
you
going
to
become
of
them
all
i
thought
he
went
on
how
bright
you
were
and
how
keen
and
eager
you
were
i
mean
in
particular
and
just
how
certain
it
was
your
brightness
and
eagerness
would
be
swallowed
up
by
some
silly
ordinariness
or
other
stuffy
marriage
or
stuffy
domestic
duties
the
old
old
story
done
over
again
with
a
sort
of
threadbare
badness
nothing
to
say
against
it
if
it
done
well
i
got
quite
sentimental
and
pathetic
about
life
breach
of
faith
with
women
odd
is
it
how
one
mind
runs
on
but
that
what
i
thought
it
all
come
back
to
me
marjorie
bright
clear
eye
came
round
to
him
i
do
see
very
much
wrong
with
the
lot
of
women
she
reflected
things
are
different
nowadays
anyhow
she
paused
you
do
want
to
be
a
man
she
was
emphatic
some
of
us
cut
more
sharply
at
life
than
you
think
he
said
plumbing
her
unspoken
sense
she
had
never
met
a
man
before
who
understood
just
how
a
girl
can
feel
the
slow
obtuseness
of
his
sex
it
was
almost
as
if
he
had
found
her
out
at
something
oh
she
said
perhaps
you
do
and
looked
at
him
with
an
increased
interest
i
i
believe
he
said
for
instance
i
got
just
a
woman
joy
in
textures
and
little
significant
shapes
i
know
how
you
feel
about
that
i
can
spend
hours
even
now
in
crystal
gazing
i
mean
to
see
some
silly
revelation
of
some
silly
person
proceedings
somewhere
but
just
for
the
things
themselves
i
wonder
if
you
have
ever
been
in
the
natural
history
museum
at
south
kensington
and
looked
at
ruskin
crystal
collection
i
saw
it
when
i
was
a
boy
and
it
became
i
ca
help
the
word
an
obsession
the
inclusions
like
moss
and
like
trees
and
all
sorts
of
fantastic
things
and
the
cleavages
and
enclosures
with
little
bubbles
and
the
lights
and
shimmer
what
were
we
talking
about
oh
about
the
keen
way
your
feminine
perceptions
cut
into
things
and
yet
somehow
i
was
throwing
contempt
on
the
feminine
intelligence
i
do
do
justice
to
the
order
of
my
thoughts
never
mind
we
lost
the
thread
but
i
wish
you
knew
my
mother
he
went
on
while
marjorie
was
still
considering
the
proper
response
to
this
you
see
i
her
only
son
and
she
brought
me
up
and
we
know
each
other
oh
very
well
she
helps
with
my
work
she
understands
nearly
all
of
it
she
makes
suggestions
and
to
this
day
i
do
know
if
she
the
most
original
or
the
most
parasitic
of
creatures
and
that
the
way
with
all
women
and
girls
it
seems
to
me
you
as
critical
as
light
and
as
undiscriminating
i
say
do
i
strike
you
as
talking
nonsense
not
a
bit
said
marjorie
but
you
do
go
rather
fast
i
know
he
admitted
but
somehow
you
excite
me
i
been
with
solomonson
a
week
and
he
dull
at
all
times
it
was
that
made
me
take
out
that
monoplane
of
his
but
it
did
him
no
good
he
paused
they
told
me
after
the
said
marjorie
you
knew
more
about
crystallography
than
anyone
does
that
strike
you
as
a
dull
subject
no
said
marjorie
in
a
tone
that
invited
justifications
it
is
i
think
naturally
that
the
world
one
goes
into
when
one
studies
molecular
physics
is
quite
the
most
beautiful
of
wonderlands
i
can
assure
you
i
work
sometimes
like
a
man
who
is
exploring
a
magic
palace
do
you
know
anything
of
molecular
physics
you
examined
me
said
marjorie
the
sense
one
has
of
exquisite
and
wonderful
rhythms
just
beyond
sound
and
sight
and
there
a
taunting
suggestion
of
its
being
all
there
displayed
and
confessed
if
only
one
were
quick
enough
to
see
it
why
for
instance
when
you
change
the
composition
of
a
felspar
almost
imperceptibly
do
the
angles
change
what
the
correspondence
between
the
altered
angle
and
the
substituted
atom
why
does
this
bit
of
clear
stuff
swing
the
ray
of
light
so
much
out
of
its
path
and
that
swing
it
more
then
what
happens
when
crystals
gutter
down
and
go
into
solution
the
endless
launching
of
innumerable
little
craft
think
what
a
clear
solution
must
be
if
only
one
had
eyes
and
could
see
into
it
see
the
extraordinary
patternings
the
swimming
circling
constellations
and
then
the
path
of
a
ray
of
polarized
light
beating
through
it
it
takes
me
like
music
do
you
know
anything
of
the
effects
of
polarized
light
the
sight
of
a
slice
of
for
instance
between
crossed
nicols
i
seen
some
rock
sections
said
marjorie
i
forget
the
names
of
the
rocks
the
colours
oh
yes
the
colours
is
there
anything
else
so
rich
and
beautiful
in
all
the
world
and
every
different
mineral
and
every
variety
of
that
mineral
has
a
different
palette
of
colours
a
different
scheme
of
harmonies
and
is
telling
you
something
if
only
you
understood
exactly
all
the
ordinary
stuff
of
life
you
know
the
carts
and
motor
cars
and
dusty
roads
and
cinder
sifting
seems
so
blank
to
me
with
that
persuasion
of
swing
and
subtlety
beneath
it
all
as
if
the
whole
world
was
fire
and
crystal
and
aquiver
with
some
sort
of
cotton
wrappers
thrown
over
it
dust
sheets
said
marjorie
i
know
or
like
a
diamond
painted
over
with
that
sort
of
grey
paint
very
full
of
body
that
lasts
yes
he
smiled
at
her
i
ca
help
apologetics
most
people
think
a
professor
of
science
is
just
a
professor
of
science
yes
something
all
pedantries
and
phrases
i
want
to
clear
my
character
as
though
it
is
foolish
to
follow
a
vortex
ring
into
a
vacuum
and
wise
to
whack
at
a
dirty
golf
ball
on
a
suburban
railway
bank
oh
their
golf
under
high
heaven
you
do
play
golf
do
you
by
any
chance
only
the
woman
part
said
marjorie
and
they
despise
us
he
said
solomonson
can
hardly
hide
how
he
despises
us
nothing
is
more
wonderful
than
the
way
these
people
go
on
despising
us
who
do
research
who
have
this
fever
of
curiosity
who
wo
be
content
with
what
did
you
call
those
wrappers
dust
sheets
yes
dust
sheets
what
a
life
swaddling
bands
dust
sheets
and
a
shroud
you
know
research
and
discovery
are
nearly
so
difficult
as
people
think
if
only
you
have
the
courage
to
say
a
thing
or
try
a
thing
now
and
then
that
it
is
usual
to
say
or
try
and
after
all
he
went
off
at
a
tangent
these
confounded
ordinary
people
justified
in
their
contempt
we
keep
on
throwing
them
things
over
our
shoulders
electric
bells
telephones
marconigrams
look
at
the
beautiful
electric
trains
that
come
towering
down
the
london
streets
at
nightfall
ships
of
light
in
full
sail
twenty
years
ago
they
were
as
impossible
as
immortality
we
conquer
the
seas
for
these
golfers
puts
arms
in
their
hands
that
will
certainly
blow
them
all
to
bits
if
ever
the
idiots
go
to
war
with
them
come
sailing
out
of
the
air
on
them
he
caught
marjorie
eye
and
stopped
out
of
the
air
on
them
corrected
marjorie
very
softly
that
was
only
an
accident
said
trafford
so
they
began
a
conversation
in
the
lane
where
the
trees
met
overhead
that
went
on
and
went
on
like
a
devious
path
in
a
shady
wood
and
touched
upon
all
manner
of
things
in
the
end
quite
a
number
of
people
were
aggrieved
by
this
dialogue
in
the
lane
that
led
nowhither
sir
rupert
solomonson
was
the
first
to
complain
trafford
had
been
away
three
mortal
hours
no
one
had
come
near
him
not
a
soul
and
there
had
been
even
a
passing
car
to
cheer
his
ear
sir
rupert
admitted
he
had
to
be
quiet
but
not
so
quiet
i
have
been
glad
said
sir
rupert
if
a
hen
had
laid
an
egg
and
clucked
a
bit
you
might
have
thought
there
had
been
a
resurrection
or
somethin
and
cleared
off
everybody
lord
it
was
deadly
i
have
sung
out
myself
if
it
had
been
for
these
infernal
ribs
pope
came
upon
the
affair
quite
by
accident
well
marjorie
she
said
as
she
poured
tea
for
the
family
did
you
get
your
laces
never
got
there
mummy
said
marjorie
and
paused
fatally
did
get
there
said
pope
that
worse
than
theodore
would
the
donkey
go
poor
dear
there
was
nothing
to
colour
about
and
yet
marjorie
felt
the
warm
flow
in
neck
and
cheek
and
brow
she
threw
extraordinary
quantities
of
candour
into
her
manner
i
had
a
romantic
adventure
she
said
rather
quietly
i
was
going
to
tell
you
sensation
you
see
it
was
like
this
said
marjorie
i
ran
against
trafford
she
drank
tea
and
pulled
herself
together
for
a
lively
description
of
the
and
the
subsequent
conversation
a
bright
ridiculous
account
which
made
the
affair
happen
by
implication
on
the
high
road
and
not
in
a
byeway
and
was
adorned
with
every
facetious
ornament
that
seemed
likely
to
get
a
laugh
from
the
children
but
she
talked
rather
fast
and
she
felt
she
forced
the
fun
a
little
however
it
amused
the
children
all
right
and
theodore
created
a
diversion
by
choking
with
his
tea
from
first
to
last
marjorie
was
extremely
careful
to
avoid
the
affectionate
scrutiny
of
her
mother
eye
and
had
this
lasted
the
afternoon
asked
pope
oh
they
talked
for
said
marjorie
or
more
and
had
driven
back
very
slowly
together
he
did
all
the
talking
you
saw
what
he
was
yesterday
and
the
donkeys
seemed
too
happy
together
to
tear
them
away
but
what
was
it
all
about
asked
daffy
curious
he
asked
after
you
daffy
most
affectionately
said
marjorie
and
added
several
times
though
trafford
had
as
a
matter
of
fact
displayed
a
quite
remarkable
disregard
of
all
her
family
and
she
went
on
getting
a
plausible
idea
at
last
he
explained
all
about
aeroplanes
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
has
daddy
gone
to
wamping
for
some
more
cricket
but
none
of
this
was
lost
on
mrs
pope
mr
magnet
return
next
day
was
heralded
by
nearly
of
a
column
in
the
the
lecture
on
the
characteristics
of
humour
had
evidently
been
quite
a
serious
affair
and
a
very
imposing
list
of
humorists
and
of
prominent
people
associated
with
their
industry
had
accepted
the
hospitality
of
the
marjorie
ran
her
eyes
over
the
chairman
flattering
introduction
then
with
a
queer
faint
flavour
of
hostility
she
reached
her
destined
husband
utterance
she
seemed
to
hear
the
flat
full
tones
of
his
voice
as
she
read
and
automatically
the
desiccated
sentences
of
the
reporter
filled
out
again
into
those
rich
quietly
deliberate
unfoldings
of
sound
that
were
already
too
familiar
to
her
ear
mr
magnet
had
begun
with
modest
disavowals
there
was
a
story
he
said
so
the
report
began
whose
hallowed
antiquity
ought
to
protect
it
from
further
exploitation
but
he
was
tempted
to
repeat
it
because
it
offered
certain
analogies
to
the
present
situation
there
were
three
characters
in
the
story
a
bluebottle
and
two
scotsmen
laughter
the
bluebottle
buzzed
on
the
pane
otherwise
a
profound
silence
reigned
this
was
broken
by
one
of
the
scotsmen
trying
to
locate
the
bluebottle
with
zoölogical
exactitude
said
this
scotsman
i
am
thinking
if
yon
fly
is
a
birdie
or
a
beastie
the
other
replied
do
spoil
good
whiskey
with
religious
conversation
laughter
he
was
tempted
mr
magnet
resumed
to
ask
himself
and
them
why
it
was
that
they
should
spoil
the
aftereffects
of
a
most
excellent
and
admirably
served
dinner
by
an
academic
discussion
on
british
humour
at
first
he
was
pained
by
the
thought
that
they
proposed
to
temper
their
hospitality
with
a
demand
for
a
speech
a
closer
inspection
showed
that
he
was
to
introduce
a
debate
and
that
others
were
to
speak
and
that
was
a
new
element
in
their
hospitality
further
he
was
permitted
to
choose
the
subject
so
that
he
could
bring
their
speeches
within
the
range
of
his
comprehension
laughter
his
was
an
easy
task
he
could
make
it
easier
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
say
nothing
at
all
laughter
for
a
space
the
reporter
seemed
to
have
omitted
largely
perhaps
he
was
changing
places
with
his
relief
and
the
next
sentence
showed
mr
magnet
engaged
as
it
were
in
revising
a
of
jokes
there
was
the
humour
of
facts
and
situations
he
was
saying
or
that
humour
of
expression
for
which
there
was
no
human
responsibility
as
in
the
case
of
irish
humour
he
spoke
of
the
humour
of
the
soil
which
found
its
noblest
utterance
in
the
bull
humour
depended
largely
on
contrast
there
was
a
humour
of
form
and
expression
which
had
many
local
varieties
american
humour
had
been
characterized
by
exaggeration
the
suppression
of
some
link
in
the
chain
of
argument
or
narrative
and
a
wealth
of
simile
and
metaphor
which
had
been
justly
defined
as
the
poetry
of
a
pioneer
marjorie
attention
slipped
its
anchor
and
caught
lower
down
upon
in
england
there
was
a
near
kinship
between
laughter
and
tears
their
mental
relations
were
as
close
as
their
physical
abroad
this
did
not
appear
to
be
the
case
it
was
different
in
france
but
perhaps
on
the
whole
it
would
be
better
to
leave
the
humour
of
france
and
what
some
people
still
unhappily
chose
to
regard
as
matters
open
to
controversy
he
referred
to
choice
of
subject
out
of
their
discussion
altogether
hear
and
attention
wandered
again
then
she
remarked
it
reminded
her
in
some
mysterious
way
of
a
dropped
hairpin
it
was
noticeable
that
the
pun
to
a
great
extent
had
become
démodé
at
this
point
the
flight
of
marjorie
eyes
down
the
column
was
arrested
by
her
father
hand
gently
but
firmly
taking
possession
of
the
she
yielded
it
without
reluctance
turned
to
the
breakfast
table
and
never
resumed
her
study
of
the
social
relaxations
of
humorists
indeed
she
forgot
it
her
mind
was
in
a
state
of
extreme
perplexity
she
did
know
what
to
make
of
herself
or
anything
or
anybody
her
mind
was
full
of
trafford
and
all
that
he
had
said
and
done
and
all
that
he
might
have
said
and
done
and
it
was
entirely
characteristic
that
she
could
not
think
of
magnet
in
any
way
at
all
except
as
a
shadow
that
lay
across
all
her
memories
and
all
the
bright
possibilities
of
this
engaging
person
she
thought
particularly
of
the
mobile
animation
of
his
face
the
keen
flash
of
enthusiasm
in
his
thoughts
and
expressions
it
was
perhaps
more
characteristic
of
her
time
than
of
her
that
she
did
not
think
she
was
dealing
so
much
with
a
moral
problem
as
an
embarrassment
and
that
she
had
as
yet
felt
the
first
stirrings
of
for
the
series
of
disingenuous
proceedings
that
had
rendered
the
yesterday
encounter
possible
but
she
was
restless
wildly
restless
as
a
bird
whose
nest
is
taken
she
could
abide
nowhere
she
fretted
through
the
morning
avoided
daffy
in
a
marked
manner
and
inflicted
a
stinging
and
only
partially
merited
rebuke
upon
theodore
for
slouching
humping
and
of
all
trite
grievances
not
washing
behind
his
ears
as
if
any
chap
washed
behind
his
ears
she
thought
tennis
with
the
might
assuage
her
but
she
broke
off
after
losing
two
sets
and
then
she
went
into
the
garden
to
get
fresh
flowers
and
picked
a
large
bunch
and
left
them
on
the
piano
until
her
mother
reminded
her
of
them
she
tried
a
little
shaw
she
struggled
with
an
insane
wish
to
walk
through
the
wood
behind
the
village
and
have
an
accidental
meeting
with
someone
who
could
possibly
appear
but
whom
it
would
be
quite
adorable
to
meet
anyhow
she
conquered
that
she
had
a
curious
and
rather
morbid
indisposition
to
go
after
lunch
to
the
station
and
meet
mr
magnet
as
her
mother
wished
her
to
do
in
order
to
bring
him
straight
to
the
vicarage
to
early
tea
but
here
again
reason
prevailed
and
she
went
mr
magnet
arrived
by
the
and
to
marjorie
eye
his
alighting
presence
had
an
effect
of
being
not
so
much
covered
with
laurels
as
distended
by
them
his
face
seemed
whiter
and
larger
than
ever
he
waved
a
great
handful
of
newspapers
hullo
magsy
he
said
they
given
me
a
thumping
press
i
nearer
swelled
head
than
i
ever
been
so
mind
how
you
touch
me
we
take
it
down
at
croquet
said
marjorie
they
cleared
that
thing
away
and
made
up
the
lawn
like
a
billiard
table
she
said
that
makes
for
skill
he
said
waggishly
i
shall
save
my
head
after
all
for
a
moment
he
seemed
to
loom
towards
kissing
her
but
she
averted
this
danger
by
a
concern
for
his
bag
he
entrusted
this
to
a
porter
and
reverted
to
the
triumph
of
overnight
so
soon
as
they
were
clear
of
the
station
he
was
overflowing
with
kindliness
towards
his
fellow
humorists
who
had
appeared
in
force
and
very
generously
at
the
banquet
and
had
said
the
most
charming
things
some
of
which
were
in
one
report
and
some
in
another
and
some
the
reporters
had
missed
altogether
some
of
the
kindliest
it
a
pleasant
feeling
to
think
that
a
lot
of
good
fellows
think
you
are
a
good
fellow
said
mr
magnet
he
became
solicitous
for
her
how
had
she
got
on
while
he
was
away
she
asked
him
how
one
was
likely
to
get
on
at
buryhamstreet
monoplanes
did
fall
every
day
and
as
she
said
that
it
occurred
to
her
she
was
behaving
meanly
but
he
was
going
on
to
his
next
topic
before
she
could
qualify
i
got
something
in
my
pocket
he
remarked
and
playfully
guess
she
did
but
she
would
she
had
a
curious
sinking
of
the
heart
i
want
you
to
see
it
before
anyone
else
he
said
then
if
you
like
it
it
can
go
back
it
a
sapphire
he
was
feeling
nervously
in
his
pockets
and
then
the
little
box
was
in
her
hand
she
hesitated
to
open
it
it
made
everything
so
dreadfully
concrete
and
this
time
the
sense
of
meanness
was
altogether
acuter
he
bought
this
in
london
he
brought
it
down
hoping
for
her
approval
yes
it
was
horrid
but
what
was
she
to
do
it
awfully
pretty
she
said
with
the
glittering
symbol
in
her
hand
and
indeed
he
had
gone
to
one
of
those
artistic
women
who
are
reviving
and
improving
upon
the
rich
old
roman
designs
it
so
beautifully
made
i
so
glad
you
like
it
you
really
like
it
i
do
deserve
it
oh
but
you
like
it
enormously
ah
i
spent
an
hour
in
choosing
it
she
could
see
him
she
felt
as
though
she
had
picked
his
pocket
only
i
do
deserve
it
mr
magnet
indeed
i
do
i
feel
i
am
taking
it
on
false
pretences
nonsense
magsy
nonsense
slip
it
on
your
finger
girl
but
i
do
she
insisted
he
took
the
box
from
her
pocketed
it
and
seized
her
hand
she
drew
it
away
from
him
no
she
said
i
feel
like
a
cheat
you
know
i
do
i
sure
i
do
love
i
love
enough
for
two
he
said
and
got
her
hand
again
no
he
said
at
her
gesture
you
wear
it
why
should
you
and
so
marjorie
came
back
along
the
vicarage
avenue
with
his
ring
upon
her
hand
and
pope
was
evidently
very
glad
to
see
him
the
family
was
still
seated
at
tea
upon
rugs
and
wraps
and
still
discussing
humorists
at
play
when
professor
trafford
appeared
leaning
on
a
large
stick
and
limping
but
resolute
by
the
church
gate
pish
said
pope
marjorie
tried
not
to
reveal
a
certain
dismay
there
was
dumb
rich
approval
in
daphne
eyes
and
the
pleasure
of
theodore
and
the
was
only
too
scandalously
evident
said
theodore
with
relief
pope
was
the
incarnate
invocation
of
tact
as
trafford
drew
near
i
hope
he
said
with
obvious
insincerity
i
do
invade
you
but
solomonson
is
frightfully
concerned
and
anxious
about
your
lawn
and
whether
his
men
cleared
it
up
properly
and
put
things
right
his
eye
went
about
the
party
and
rested
on
marjorie
how
are
you
he
said
in
a
friendly
voice
well
we
seem
to
have
got
our
croquet
lawn
back
said
pope
and
our
nerves
are
recovering
how
is
sir
rupert
a
little
fractious
said
trafford
with
the
ghost
of
a
smile
you
take
some
tea
said
pope
in
the
pause
that
followed
thank
you
said
trafford
and
sat
down
instantly
i
saw
your
jolly
address
in
the
he
said
to
magnet
i
have
read
anything
so
amusing
for
some
time
rom
dear
said
pope
will
you
take
the
pot
in
and
get
some
fresh
tea
trafford
addressed
himself
to
the
flattery
of
magnet
with
considerable
skill
he
had
detected
a
lurking
hostility
in
the
eyes
of
the
two
gentlemen
that
counselled
him
to
propitiate
them
if
he
meant
to
maintain
his
footing
in
the
vicarage
and
now
he
talked
to
them
almost
exclusively
and
ignored
the
ladies
modestly
but
politely
in
the
way
that
seems
natural
and
proper
in
a
british
house
of
the
better
sort
but
as
he
talked
chiefly
of
the
improvement
of
motor
machinery
that
had
recently
been
shown
at
the
engineering
exhibition
he
did
not
make
that
headway
with
marjorie
father
that
he
had
perhaps
anticipated
pope
fumed
quietly
for
a
time
and
then
suddenly
spoke
out
i
no
lover
of
machines
he
said
abruptly
slashing
across
trafford
description
all
our
troubles
began
with
villainous
saltpetre
i
an
man
with
a
nose
and
a
neck
and
i
want
the
one
offended
or
the
other
broken
no
do
ask
me
to
be
interested
in
your
valves
and
cylinders
what
do
you
say
magnet
it
starts
machinery
in
my
head
to
hear
about
them
on
such
occasions
as
this
when
pope
spoke
out
his
horror
of
an
or
any
sort
of
contradiction
was
apt
to
bring
the
utterance
to
a
culmination
not
always
to
be
distinguished
from
a
flight
and
now
he
rose
to
his
feet
as
he
delivered
himself
who
for
a
game
of
tennis
he
said
in
this
last
uncontaminated
patch
of
air
i
and
marjorie
will
give
you
a
match
daffy
if
magnet
is
too
tired
to
join
you
daffy
looked
at
marjorie
for
an
instant
we
want
you
theodore
to
look
after
the
balls
in
the
potatoes
said
pope
lest
that
ingenuous
mind
should
be
corrupted
behind
his
back
pope
found
herself
left
to
entertain
a
slightly
disgruntled
trafford
rom
and
syd
hovered
on
the
off
chance
of
notice
at
the
corner
of
the
croquet
lawn
nearest
the
tea
things
pope
had
already
determined
to
make
certain
little
matters
clearer
than
they
appeared
to
be
to
this
agreeable
but
superfluous
person
and
she
was
greatly
assisted
by
his
opening
upon
the
subject
of
her
daughters
jolly
tennis
looks
he
said
do
they
said
pope
i
think
it
is
such
a
graceful
game
for
a
girl
trafford
glanced
at
pope
face
but
her
expression
was
impenetrable
they
both
like
it
and
play
it
so
well
she
said
their
father
is
so
skillful
and
interested
in
games
marjorie
tells
me
you
were
her
examiner
a
year
or
so
ago
yes
she
struck
my
memory
her
work
stood
out
of
course
she
is
clever
said
pope
or
we
should
have
sent
her
to
oxbridge
there
she
doing
quite
well
quite
well
everyone
says
so
i
do
know
of
course
if
mr
magnet
will
let
her
finish
there
mr
magnet
she
just
engaged
to
him
of
course
she
frightfully
excited
about
it
and
naturally
he
wants
her
to
come
away
and
marry
there
very
little
excuse
for
a
long
engagement
no
her
voice
died
in
a
musical
little
note
and
she
seemed
to
be
scrutinizing
the
tennis
with
an
absorbed
interest
they
got
new
balls
she
said
as
if
to
herself
trafford
had
rolled
over
and
she
fancied
she
detected
a
change
in
his
voice
when
it
came
is
it
rather
a
waste
not
to
finish
a
university
career
he
said
oh
it
would
be
wasted
of
course
a
girl
like
that
will
be
hand
and
glove
with
her
husband
she
be
able
to
help
him
with
the
scientific
side
of
his
jokes
and
all
that
i
sometimes
wish
it
had
been
daffy
who
had
gone
to
college
though
i
sometimes
think
we
sacrificed
daffy
a
little
she
not
the
bright
quickness
of
marjorie
but
something
quietly
solid
about
her
mind
something
perhaps
i
did
want
her
to
go
away
from
me
mr
magnet
is
doing
wonders
at
the
net
he
just
begun
to
play
to
please
marjorie
do
you
think
he
a
dreadfully
amusing
man
trafford
he
says
such
things
the
effect
of
this
upon
trafford
was
not
what
it
should
have
been
properly
he
ought
to
have
realized
at
once
that
marjorie
was
for
ever
beyond
his
aspirations
and
if
he
found
it
too
difficult
to
regard
her
with
equanimity
then
he
ought
to
have
shunned
her
presence
but
instead
after
his
first
shock
of
incredulous
astonishment
his
spirit
rose
in
a
rebellion
against
arranged
facts
that
was
as
as
it
was
ungentlemanly
he
went
back
to
solomonson
with
a
mood
of
thoughtful
depression
giving
place
to
a
growing
passion
of
indignation
he
presented
it
to
himself
in
a
generalized
and
altruistic
form
what
the
deuce
is
the
good
of
all
this
talk
of
eugenics
he
asked
himself
aloud
if
they
are
going
to
hand
over
that
shining
girl
to
that
beastly
little
area
sneak
he
called
mr
magnet
a
beastly
little
area
sneak
nothing
could
show
more
clearly
just
how
much
he
had
contrived
to
fall
in
love
with
marjorie
during
his
brief
sojourn
in
buryhamstreet
and
the
acuteness
of
his
disappointment
and
nothing
could
be
more
eloquent
of
his
forcible
and
undisciplined
temperament
and
out
of
ten
thousand
possible
abusive
epithets
with
which
his
mind
was
no
doubt
stored
this
one
i
think
had
come
into
his
head
because
of
the
alert
watchfulness
with
which
mr
magnet
followed
a
conversation
as
he
waited
his
chance
for
some
neat
but
brilliant
flash
of
comment
trafford
like
marjorie
was
another
of
those
undisciplined
young
people
our
age
has
produced
in
such
significant
quantity
he
was
just
but
the
facts
that
he
was
big
of
build
had
as
an
only
child
associated
much
with
people
and
was
already
a
conspicuous
success
in
the
world
of
research
had
given
him
the
and
assurance
of
a
much
older
man
he
had
still
to
come
his
croppers
and
learn
most
of
the
important
lessons
in
life
and
so
far
he
was
aware
of
it
he
was
naturally
very
busy
and
interested
in
his
work
and
on
remarkably
friendly
and
confidential
terms
with
his
mother
who
kept
house
for
him
and
though
he
had
had
several
small
love
disturbances
this
was
the
first
occasion
that
anything
of
the
kind
had
ploughed
deep
into
his
feelings
and
desires
trafford
father
had
died
early
in
life
he
had
been
a
brilliant
pathologist
one
of
that
splendid
group
of
scientific
investigators
in
the
middle
victorian
period
which
shines
ever
more
brightly
as
our
criticism
dims
their
associated
splendours
and
he
had
died
before
he
was
thirty
through
a
momentary
slip
of
the
scalpel
his
wife
she
had
been
his
wife
for
five
years
found
his
child
and
his
memory
and
the
quality
of
the
life
he
had
made
about
her
too
satisfying
for
the
risks
of
a
second
marriage
and
she
had
brought
up
her
son
with
a
passionate
belief
in
the
high
mission
of
research
and
the
supreme
duty
of
seeking
out
and
expressing
truth
finely
and
here
he
was
calling
mr
magnet
a
beastly
little
area
sneak
the
situation
perplexed
him
marjorie
perplexed
him
it
was
had
he
known
it
the
beginning
for
him
of
a
lifetime
of
problems
and
perplexities
he
was
absolutely
certain
she
did
love
magnet
why
then
had
she
agreed
to
marry
him
such
pressures
and
temptations
as
he
could
see
about
her
seemed
light
to
him
in
comparison
with
such
an
undertaking
were
they
greater
than
he
supposed
his
method
of
coming
to
the
issue
of
that
problem
was
entirely
original
he
presented
himself
next
afternoon
with
the
air
of
an
invited
guest
drove
pope
who
was
suffering
from
liver
to
expostulatory
sulking
in
the
study
and
expressed
a
passionate
craving
for
in
spite
of
pope
extreme
solicitude
for
his
still
bandaged
ankle
he
was
partnered
with
daffy
and
for
a
long
time
he
sought
speech
with
marjorie
in
vain
at
last
he
was
isolated
in
a
corner
of
the
lawn
and
with
the
thinnest
pretence
of
inadvertence
in
spite
of
daffy
despairing
cry
of
she
plays
next
he
laid
up
within
two
yards
of
her
he
walked
across
to
her
as
she
addressed
herself
to
her
ball
and
speaking
in
an
incredulous
tone
and
with
the
air
of
a
comment
on
the
game
he
said
i
say
are
you
engaged
to
that
chap
magnet
marjorie
was
amazed
but
remarkably
not
offended
something
in
his
tone
set
her
trembling
she
forgot
to
play
and
stood
with
her
mallet
hanging
in
her
hand
punish
him
came
the
voice
of
magnet
from
afar
yes
she
said
faintly
his
remark
came
low
and
clear
it
had
a
note
of
angry
protest
marjorie
by
the
way
of
answer
hit
her
ball
so
that
it
jumped
and
missed
his
ricochetted
across
the
lawn
and
out
of
the
ground
on
the
further
side
i
sorry
if
i
annoyed
you
said
trafford
as
marjorie
went
after
her
ball
and
daffy
thanked
heaven
aloud
for
the
respite
they
came
together
no
more
for
a
time
and
trafford
observant
with
every
sense
found
no
clue
to
the
riddle
of
her
grave
intent
bearing
she
played
very
badly
and
with
unusual
care
and
deliberation
he
felt
he
had
made
a
mess
of
things
altogether
and
suddenly
found
his
leg
was
too
painful
to
go
on
partner
he
asked
will
you
play
out
my
ball
for
me
i
ca
go
on
i
shall
have
to
go
marjorie
surveyed
him
while
daffy
and
magnet
expressed
solicitude
he
turned
to
go
mallet
in
hand
and
found
marjorie
following
him
is
that
the
heavier
mallet
she
asked
and
stood
before
him
looking
into
his
eyes
and
weighing
a
mallet
in
either
hand
trafford
you
one
of
the
worst
examiners
i
ever
met
she
said
he
looked
puzzled
i
do
know
said
marjorie
i
wonder
as
much
as
you
but
i
am
and
seeing
the
light
dawning
in
his
eyes
she
turned
about
and
went
back
to
the
debacle
of
her
game
after
that
trafford
had
one
clear
desire
in
his
being
which
ruled
all
his
other
desires
he
wanted
a
long
frank
unembarrassed
and
uninterrupted
conversation
with
marjorie
he
had
a
very
strong
impression
that
marjorie
wanted
exactly
the
same
thing
for
a
week
he
besieged
the
situation
in
vain
after
the
fourth
day
solomonson
was
only
kept
in
buryhamstreet
by
sheer
exerted
with
a
brutality
that
threatened
to
end
that
friendship
abruptly
he
went
home
on
the
sixth
day
in
his
largest
car
but
trafford
stayed
on
beyond
the
limits
of
decency
to
perform
some
incomprehensible
service
that
he
spoke
of
as
clearing
up
i
want
he
said
to
clear
up
but
what
there
to
clear
up
my
dear
boy
solomonson
you
a
pampered
plutocrat
said
trafford
as
though
everything
was
explained
i
do
see
any
sense
in
it
at
all
said
solomonson
and
regarded
his
friend
aslant
with
thick
black
eyebrows
raised
i
going
to
stay
said
trafford
and
solomonson
said
one
of
those
unhappy
and
entirely
disregarded
things
that
ought
never
to
be
said
there
some
girl
in
this
said
solomonson
your
bedroom
always
waiting
for
you
at
riplings
he
said
when
at
last
he
was
going
off
trafford
conviction
that
marjorie
also
wanted
with
an
almost
equal
eagerness
the
same
opportunity
for
speech
and
explanations
that
he
desired
sustained
him
in
a
series
of
unjustifiable
intrusions
upon
the
seclusion
of
the
popes
but
although
the
manner
of
and
pope
did
change
considerably
for
the
better
after
his
next
visit
it
was
extraordinary
how
impossible
it
seemed
for
him
and
marjorie
to
achieve
their
common
end
of
an
encounter
always
something
intervened
in
the
first
place
pope
disposition
to
optimism
had
got
the
better
of
her
earlier
discretions
and
a
casual
glance
at
daphne
face
when
their
visitor
reappeared
started
quite
a
new
thread
of
interpretations
in
her
mind
she
had
taken
the
opportunity
of
hinting
at
this
when
pope
asked
over
his
that
night
what
the
devil
that
that
chauffeur
chap
meant
by
always
calling
in
the
afternoon
now
that
will
magnet
monopolizes
marjorie
she
said
after
a
little
pause
and
a
rustle
or
so
i
do
see
why
daffy
should
have
a
little
company
of
her
own
age
pope
turned
round
and
stared
at
her
i
did
think
of
that
he
said
but
anyhow
i
do
like
the
fellow
he
seems
to
be
rather
clever
said
pope
though
he
certainly
talks
too
much
and
after
all
it
was
sir
rupert
aeroplane
was
only
driving
it
to
oblige
he
think
twice
before
he
drives
another
said
pope
wrenching
off
his
collar
once
pope
had
turned
her
imagination
in
this
more
and
more
agreeable
direction
she
was
rather
disposed
i
am
afraid
to
let
it
bolt
with
her
and
it
was
a
deflection
that
certainly
fell
in
very
harmoniously
with
certain
secret
speculations
of
daphne
trafford
too
being
quite
unused
to
any
sort
of
social
furtiveness
did
perhaps
in
order
to
divert
attention
from
his
preoccupation
with
marjorie
attend
more
markedly
to
daphne
than
he
would
otherwise
have
done
and
so
presently
he
found
daphne
almost
continuously
on
his
hands
so
far
as
she
was
concerned
he
might
have
told
her
the
entire
history
of
his
life
and
every
secret
he
had
in
the
world
without
let
or
hindrance
pope
too
showed
a
growing
appreciation
of
his
company
became
sympathetic
and
confidential
in
a
way
that
invited
confidence
and
threw
a
lot
of
light
on
her
family
history
and
daffy
character
she
had
found
daffy
a
wonderful
study
she
said
pope
too
seemed
partly
reconciled
to
him
the
idea
that
after
all
both
motor
cars
and
monoplane
were
sir
rupert
and
not
trafford
had
produced
a
reaction
in
the
latter
gentleman
favour
moreover
it
had
occurred
to
him
that
trafford
accident
had
perhaps
disposed
him
towards
a
more
thoughtful
view
of
mechanical
traction
and
that
this
tendency
would
be
greatly
helped
by
a
little
genial
chaff
so
that
he
ceased
to
go
indoors
when
trafford
was
there
and
hung
about
meditating
and
delivering
sly
digs
at
this
new
victim
of
his
ripe
humour
nor
did
it
help
trafford
in
his
quest
for
marjorie
and
a
free
outspoken
delivery
that
the
considered
him
a
person
of
very
considerable
charm
and
that
theodore
though
indisposed
to
suck
up
to
him
publicly
i
write
here
in
theodorese
did
so
desire
intimate
and
solitary
communion
with
him
more
particularly
in
view
of
the
chances
of
an
adventitious
aeroplane
ride
that
seemed
to
hang
about
him
as
to
stalk
him
persistently
hovering
on
the
verge
of
groups
playing
a
waiting
game
with
a
tennis
ball
and
an
old
racquet
strolling
artlessly
towards
the
gate
of
the
avenue
when
the
time
seemed
ripening
for
his
appearance
or
departure
on
the
other
hand
marjorie
was
greatly
entangled
by
magnet
magnet
was
naturally
an
attentive
lover
he
was
full
of
small
encumbering
services
and
it
made
him
none
the
less
assiduous
to
perceive
that
marjorie
seemed
to
find
no
sort
of
pleasure
in
all
the
little
things
he
did
he
seemed
to
think
that
if
picking
the
very
best
rose
he
could
find
for
her
did
not
cause
a
very
perceptible
brightening
in
her
then
it
was
all
the
more
necessary
quietly
to
force
her
racquet
from
her
hand
and
carry
it
for
her
or
help
her
ineffectually
to
cross
a
ditch
or
offer
to
read
her
in
a
rich
abundant
well
modulated
voice
some
choice
passage
from
the
forest
lovers
of
maurice
hewlett
and
behind
these
devotions
there
was
a
streak
of
jealousy
he
knew
as
if
by
instinct
that
it
was
not
wise
to
leave
these
two
handsome
young
people
together
he
had
a
queer
little
disagreeable
sensation
whenever
they
spoke
to
one
another
or
looked
at
one
another
whenever
trafford
and
marjorie
found
themselves
in
a
group
there
was
magnet
in
the
midst
of
them
he
knew
the
value
of
his
marjorie
and
did
not
mean
to
lose
her
being
jointly
baffled
in
this
way
was
oddly
stimulating
to
and
trafford
mutual
predisposition
if
you
really
want
to
throw
people
together
the
thing
to
do
thank
god
for
ireland
is
to
keep
them
apart
by
the
fourth
day
of
this
emotional
incubation
marjorie
was
thinking
of
trafford
to
the
exclusion
of
all
her
reading
and
trafford
was
lying
awake
at
nights
oh
for
half
an
hour
and
more
thinking
of
bold
decisive
ways
of
getting
at
marjorie
and
bold
decisive
things
to
say
to
her
when
he
did
but
why
she
should
be
engaged
to
magnet
continued
nevertheless
to
puzzle
him
extremely
it
was
a
puzzle
to
which
no
complete
solution
was
ever
to
be
forthcoming
at
last
that
opportunity
came
marjorie
had
come
with
her
mother
into
the
village
and
while
pope
made
some
purchases
at
the
general
shop
she
walked
on
to
speak
to
blythe
the
washerwoman
trafford
suddenly
emerged
from
the
red
lion
with
a
soda
syphon
under
each
arm
she
came
forward
smiling
i
say
he
said
forthwith
i
want
to
talk
with
you
badly
and
i
she
said
unhesitatingly
with
you
how
can
we
there
always
people
about
it
absurd
we
have
to
meet
yes
i
have
to
go
away
i
ought
to
have
gone
two
days
ago
where
we
meet
she
had
it
all
prepared
listen
she
said
there
is
a
path
runs
from
our
shrubbery
through
a
little
wood
to
a
stile
on
the
main
road
he
nodded
either
i
will
be
there
at
three
or
about
five
or
there
one
more
chance
while
father
and
mr
magnet
are
smoking
at
nine
i
might
get
away
could
i
write
no
impossible
i
no
end
of
things
to
say
pope
appeared
outside
her
shop
and
trafford
gesticulated
a
greeting
with
the
syphons
all
right
he
said
to
marjorie
shopping
he
cried
as
pope
approached
all
through
the
day
marjorie
desired
to
go
to
trafford
and
could
not
do
so
it
was
some
minutes
past
nine
when
at
last
with
a
swift
rustle
of
skirts
that
sounded
louder
than
all
the
world
to
her
she
crossed
the
dimly
lit
hall
between
and
and
came
into
the
dreamland
of
moonlight
upon
the
lawn
she
had
told
her
mother
she
was
going
upstairs
at
any
moment
she
might
be
missed
but
she
would
have
fled
now
to
trafford
if
an
army
pursued
her
her
heart
seemed
beating
in
her
throat
and
every
fibre
of
her
being
was
aquiver
she
flitted
past
the
window
like
a
ghost
she
did
not
dare
to
glance
aside
at
the
smokers
within
and
round
the
lawn
to
the
shrubbery
and
so
under
a
blackness
of
trees
to
the
gate
where
he
stood
waiting
and
there
he
was
dim
and
mysterious
and
wonderful
holding
the
gate
open
for
her
and
she
was
breathless
and
speechless
and
near
sobbing
she
stood
before
him
for
a
moment
her
face
moonlit
and
laced
with
the
shadows
of
little
twigs
and
then
his
arms
came
out
to
her
my
darling
he
said
oh
my
darling
they
had
no
doubt
of
one
another
or
of
anything
in
the
world
they
clung
together
their
lips
came
together
fresh
and
untainted
as
those
first
lovers
in
the
garden
i
will
die
for
you
he
said
i
will
give
all
the
world
for
you
they
had
thought
all
through
the
day
of
a
hundred
statements
and
explanations
they
would
make
when
this
moment
came
and
never
a
word
of
it
all
was
uttered
all
their
anticipations
of
a
highly
strung
eventful
conversation
vanished
phrases
of
the
most
striking
sort
went
like
phantom
leaves
before
a
gale
he
held
her
and
she
clung
to
him
between
laughing
and
sobbing
and
both
were
swiftly
and
conclusively
assured
their
lives
must
never
separate
again
marjorie
never
knew
whether
it
was
a
moment
or
an
age
before
her
father
came
upon
them
he
had
decided
to
take
a
turn
in
the
garden
when
magnet
could
no
longer
restrain
himself
from
joining
the
ladies
and
he
chanced
to
be
stick
in
hand
because
that
was
his
habit
after
twilight
so
it
was
he
found
them
she
heard
his
voice
falling
through
love
and
moonlight
like
something
that
comes
out
of
an
immense
distance
good
god
he
cried
what
next
but
he
still
had
realized
the
worst
daffy
he
said
what
in
the
name
of
goodness
marjorie
put
her
hands
before
her
face
too
late
good
lord
he
cried
with
a
rising
inflection
it
madge
trafford
found
the
situation
difficult
i
should
explain
but
pope
was
giving
himself
up
to
a
towering
rage
you
damned
scoundrel
he
said
what
the
devil
are
you
doing
he
seized
marjorie
by
the
arm
and
drew
her
towards
him
my
poor
misguided
girl
he
said
and
suddenly
she
was
tensely
alive
a
little
cry
of
horror
in
her
throat
for
her
father
at
a
loss
for
words
and
full
of
heroic
rage
had
suddenly
swung
his
stick
with
passionate
force
and
struck
at
face
she
heard
the
thud
saw
trafford
wince
and
stiffen
for
a
perfectly
horrible
moment
it
seemed
to
her
these
men
their
faces
queerly
distorted
by
the
shadows
of
the
branches
in
the
slanting
moonlight
might
fight
then
she
heard
trafford
voice
sounding
cool
and
hard
and
she
knew
that
he
would
do
nothing
of
the
kind
in
that
instant
if
there
had
remained
anything
to
win
in
marjorie
it
was
altogether
won
i
asked
your
daughter
to
meet
me
here
he
said
be
off
with
you
sir
cried
pope
do
tempt
me
further
sir
and
swung
his
stick
again
but
now
the
force
had
gone
out
of
him
trafford
stood
with
a
hand
out
ready
for
him
and
watched
his
face
i
asked
your
daughter
to
meet
me
here
and
she
came
i
am
prepared
to
give
you
any
explanation
if
you
come
near
this
place
again
for
some
moments
marjorie
heart
had
been
held
still
now
it
was
beating
violently
she
felt
this
scene
must
end
trafford
she
said
will
you
go
go
now
nothing
shall
keep
us
apart
pope
turned
on
her
silence
girl
he
said
i
shall
come
to
you
said
trafford
yes
said
marjorie
marjorie
said
pope
you
go
indoors
i
have
done
nothing
be
off
sir
i
have
done
nothing
will
you
be
off
sir
and
you
marjorie
will
you
go
indoors
he
came
round
upon
her
and
after
one
still
moment
of
regard
for
trafford
and
she
looked
very
beautiful
in
the
moonlight
with
her
hair
a
little
disordered
and
her
face
alight
she
turned
to
precede
her
father
through
the
shrubbery
pope
hesitated
whether
he
should
remain
with
trafford
a
perfectly
motionless
man
is
very
disconcerting
be
off
sir
he
said
over
his
shoulder
lowered
through
a
threatening
second
and
followed
her
but
trafford
remained
stiffly
with
a
tingling
temple
down
which
a
little
thread
of
blood
was
running
until
their
retreating
footsteps
had
died
down
into
that
confused
stirring
of
little
sounds
which
makes
the
stillness
of
an
english
wood
at
night
then
he
roused
himself
with
a
profound
sigh
and
put
a
hand
to
his
cut
and
bruised
cheek
he
said
chapter
the
fourth
crisis
crisis
prevailed
in
buryhamstreet
that
night
on
half
a
dozen
sleepless
pillows
souls
communed
with
the
darkness
and
two
at
least
of
those
pillows
were
wet
with
tears
not
one
of
those
wakeful
heads
was
perfectly
clear
about
the
origins
and
bearings
of
the
trouble
not
even
pope
felt
absolutely
sure
of
himself
it
had
come
as
things
come
to
people
nowadays
because
they
will
not
think
things
out
much
less
talk
things
out
and
are
therefore
in
a
hopeless
tangle
of
values
that
tightens
sooner
or
later
to
a
knot
what
an
uncharted
perplexity
for
example
was
the
mind
of
that
excellent
woman
pope
poor
lady
she
had
a
stable
thing
in
her
head
it
is
remarkable
that
some
queer
streak
in
her
composition
sympathized
with
marjorie
passion
for
trafford
but
she
thought
it
such
a
pity
she
fought
that
sympathy
down
as
if
it
were
a
wicked
thing
and
she
fought
too
against
other
ideas
that
rose
out
of
the
deeps
and
did
not
so
much
come
into
her
mind
as
cluster
at
the
threshold
the
idea
that
marjorie
was
in
effect
grown
up
a
dozen
queer
criticisms
of
magnet
and
a
dozen
subtle
doubts
whether
after
all
marjorie
was
going
to
be
happy
with
him
as
she
assured
herself
the
girl
would
be
so
far
as
any
one
knew
trafford
might
be
an
excellent
match
and
behind
these
invaders
of
her
guarded
mind
prowled
even
worse
ones
doubts
horrible
disloyal
doubts
about
the
wisdom
and
kindness
of
pope
quite
early
in
life
pope
had
realized
that
it
is
necessary
to
be
very
careful
with
one
thoughts
they
lead
to
trouble
she
had
clipped
the
wings
of
her
own
mind
therefore
so
successfully
that
all
her
conclusions
had
become
evasions
all
her
decisions
compromises
her
profoundest
working
conviction
was
a
belief
that
nothing
in
the
world
was
of
value
but
tact
and
that
the
art
of
living
was
to
tide
things
over
but
here
it
seemed
almost
beyond
her
strength
to
achieve
any
sort
of
tiding
over
why
pope
lie
quiet
whatever
she
said
or
did
had
to
be
fitted
to
the
exigencies
of
pope
availing
himself
of
the
privileges
of
matrimony
her
husband
so
soon
as
mr
magnet
had
gone
and
they
were
upstairs
together
had
explained
the
situation
with
vivid
simplicity
and
had
gone
on
at
considerable
length
and
with
great
vivacity
to
enlarge
upon
his
daughter
behaviour
he
ascribed
this
moral
disaster
he
presented
it
as
a
moral
disaster
of
absolutely
calamitous
dimensions
entirely
to
pope
faults
and
negligences
warming
with
his
theme
he
had
employed
a
number
of
homely
expressions
rarely
heard
by
decent
women
except
in
these
sacred
intimacies
to
express
the
deep
indignation
of
a
strong
man
moved
to
unbridled
speech
by
the
wickedness
of
those
near
and
dear
to
him
still
warming
he
raised
his
voice
and
at
last
shouted
out
his
more
forcible
meanings
until
she
feared
the
servants
and
children
might
hear
waved
a
clenched
fist
at
imaginary
traffords
and
scoundrels
generally
and
giving
way
completely
to
his
outraged
virtue
smote
and
kicked
blameless
articles
of
furniture
in
a
manner
deeply
impressive
to
the
feminine
intelligence
finally
he
sat
down
in
the
little
between
her
and
the
cupboard
where
she
was
accustomed
to
hang
up
her
clothes
stuck
out
his
legs
very
stiffly
across
the
room
and
despaired
of
his
family
in
an
obtrusive
and
impregnable
silence
for
an
enormous
time
all
of
which
awakened
a
deep
sense
of
guilt
and
unworthiness
in
pope
mind
and
prevented
her
going
to
bed
but
did
not
help
her
in
the
slightest
degree
to
grasp
the
difficulties
of
the
situation
she
would
have
lain
awake
anyhow
but
she
was
greatly
helped
in
this
by
pope
restlessness
he
was
now
turning
over
from
left
to
right
or
from
right
to
left
at
intervals
of
from
four
to
seven
minutes
and
such
remarks
as
damned
scoundrel
get
out
of
this
or
daughter
and
degrade
yourself
in
this
way
or
never
let
me
see
your
face
again
plight
your
troth
to
one
man
and
fling
yourself
shamelessly
i
repeat
it
marjorie
shamelessly
into
the
arms
of
another
kept
pope
closely
in
touch
with
the
general
trend
of
his
thoughts
she
tried
to
get
together
her
plans
and
perceptions
rather
as
though
she
swept
up
dead
leaves
on
a
gusty
day
she
knew
that
the
management
of
the
whole
situation
rested
finally
on
her
and
that
whatever
she
did
or
did
not
do
or
whatever
arose
to
thwart
her
arrangements
its
entire
tale
of
responsibility
would
ultimately
fall
upon
her
shoulders
she
wondered
what
was
to
be
done
with
marjorie
with
mr
magnet
need
he
know
could
that
situation
be
saved
everything
at
present
was
raw
in
her
mind
except
for
her
husband
informal
communications
she
did
not
even
know
what
had
appeared
what
daffy
had
seen
what
magnet
thought
of
marjorie
failure
to
bid
him
for
example
had
mr
magnet
noticed
pope
profound
disturbance
she
had
to
be
ready
to
put
a
face
on
things
before
morning
and
it
seemed
impossible
she
could
do
so
in
times
of
crisis
as
every
woman
knows
it
is
always
necessary
to
misrepresent
everything
to
everybody
but
how
she
was
to
dovetail
her
misrepresentations
get
the
best
effect
from
them
extract
a
working
system
of
rights
and
wrongs
from
them
she
could
not
imagine
oh
she
did
so
wish
pope
would
lie
quiet
but
he
had
no
doubts
of
what
became
he
had
to
maintain
a
splendid
and
irrational
rage
at
any
cost
to
anybody
a
few
yards
away
a
wakeful
marjorie
confronted
a
joyless
universe
she
had
a
baffling
realization
that
her
life
was
in
a
hopeless
mess
that
she
really
had
behaved
disgracefully
and
that
she
could
for
a
moment
understand
how
it
had
happened
she
had
intended
to
make
quite
sure
of
trafford
and
then
put
things
straight
only
her
father
had
spoilt
everything
she
regarded
her
father
that
night
with
a
want
of
natural
affection
terrible
to
record
why
had
he
come
just
when
he
had
just
as
he
had
why
had
he
been
so
violent
so
impossible
of
course
she
had
no
business
to
be
there
she
examined
her
character
with
a
new
unprecedented
detachment
she
after
all
rather
a
mean
human
being
it
had
never
occurred
to
her
before
to
ask
such
a
question
now
she
asked
it
with
only
too
clear
a
sense
of
the
answer
she
tried
to
trace
how
these
multiplying
threads
of
meanness
had
first
come
into
the
fabric
of
a
life
she
had
supposed
herself
to
be
weaving
in
extremely
bright
honourable
and
adventurous
colours
she
ought
of
course
never
to
have
accepted
magnet
she
faced
the
disagreeable
word
was
she
a
liar
at
any
rate
she
told
lies
and
she
behaved
with
extraordinary
meanness
to
daphne
she
realized
that
now
she
had
known
as
precisely
as
if
she
had
been
told
how
daphne
felt
about
trafford
and
she
never
given
her
an
inkling
of
her
own
relations
she
had
for
a
moment
thought
of
daphne
no
wonder
daffy
was
sombre
and
bitter
whatever
she
knew
she
knew
enough
she
had
heard
trafford
name
in
urgent
whispers
on
the
landing
i
suppose
you
could
leave
him
alone
daffy
had
said
after
a
long
hostile
silence
that
was
all
just
a
sentence
without
prelude
or
answer
flung
across
the
bedroom
revealing
a
perfect
understanding
deeps
of
angry
disillusionment
marjorie
had
stared
and
gasped
and
made
no
answer
would
she
ever
see
him
again
after
this
horror
of
rowdy
intervention
she
did
deserve
to
she
did
deserve
anything
oh
the
tangle
of
it
all
the
tangle
of
it
all
and
those
bills
at
oxbridge
she
was
just
dragging
trafford
down
into
her
own
miserable
morass
of
a
life
her
thoughts
would
take
a
new
turn
i
love
him
she
whispered
soundlessly
i
would
die
for
him
i
would
like
to
lie
under
his
feet
and
him
not
know
it
her
mind
hung
on
that
for
a
long
time
not
know
it
until
afterwards
she
corrected
she
liked
to
be
exact
even
in
despair
and
then
in
her
memory
he
was
struck
again
and
stood
stiff
and
still
she
wanted
to
kneel
to
him
imagined
herself
kneeling
and
so
on
quite
inconclusively
round
and
round
through
the
interminable
night
hours
the
young
man
in
the
village
was
if
possible
more
perplexed
and
generally
inconclusive
than
anyone
else
in
this
series
of
nocturnal
disturbances
he
spent
long
intervals
sitting
on
his
regarding
a
world
that
was
scented
with
nightstock
and
seemed
to
be
woven
of
moonshine
and
gossamer
being
an
inexpert
and
infrequent
soliloquist
his
only
audible
comment
on
his
difficulties
was
the
repetition
in
varying
intonations
of
his
fervent
unalterable
conviction
that
he
was
damned
but
behind
this
simple
verbal
mask
was
a
great
fury
of
mental
activity
he
had
something
of
marjorie
amazement
at
the
position
of
affairs
he
had
never
properly
realized
that
it
was
possible
for
any
one
to
regard
marjorie
as
a
daughter
to
order
her
about
and
resent
the
research
for
her
society
as
criminal
it
was
a
new
light
in
his
world
some
day
he
was
to
learn
the
meaning
of
fatherhood
but
in
these
night
watches
he
regarded
it
as
a
hideous
survival
of
mediæval
darknesses
of
course
he
said
entirely
ignoring
the
actual
quality
of
their
conversation
she
had
to
explain
about
the
magnet
affair
one
converse
he
reflected
through
great
intervals
i
see
her
why
on
earth
should
i
see
her
i
suppose
they
ca
lock
her
up
for
a
time
he
contemplated
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
he
saw
reason
to
regret
the
gaps
in
his
legal
knowledge
can
any
one
get
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
for
any
one
it
does
matter
whom
more
especially
if
you
are
a
young
man
of
anxious
to
exchange
a
few
richly
charged
words
with
a
girl
of
twenty
who
is
engaged
to
someone
else
the
night
had
no
answer
it
was
nearly
dawn
when
he
came
to
the
entirely
inadvisable
conclusion
i
use
his
own
word
to
go
and
have
it
out
with
the
old
ruffian
he
would
sit
down
and
ask
him
what
he
meant
by
it
all
and
reason
with
him
if
he
started
flourishing
that
stick
again
it
would
have
to
be
taken
away
and
having
composed
a
peroration
upon
the
institution
of
the
family
of
a
character
which
he
fondly
supposed
to
be
extraordinarily
tolerant
reasonable
and
convincing
but
which
was
indeed
calculated
to
madden
pope
to
frenzy
trafford
went
very
peacefully
to
sleep
came
dawn
with
a
noise
of
birds
and
afterwards
a
little
sleep
and
then
day
and
heavy
eyes
opened
again
and
the
sound
of
frying
and
the
smell
of
coffee
recalled
our
actors
to
the
stage
pope
was
past
her
worst
despair
always
the
morning
brings
courage
and
a
clearer
grasp
of
things
and
she
could
face
the
world
with
plans
shaped
subconsciously
during
those
last
healing
moments
of
slumber
breakfast
was
difficult
but
not
impossible
pope
loomed
like
a
thundercloud
but
marjorie
pleaded
a
headache
very
wisely
and
was
taken
a
sympathetic
cup
of
tea
the
scented
trouble
but
theodore
was
heedless
and
of
an
entertaining
noise
made
by
a
moorhen
as
it
dived
in
the
ornamental
water
that
morning
you
could
make
it
practically
and
it
amused
syd
he
seemed
to
think
the
opaque
to
such
small
sounds
and
learnt
better
only
to
be
dismissed
underfed
and
ignominiously
from
the
table
to
meditate
upon
the
imperfections
of
his
soul
in
the
schoolroom
there
for
a
time
he
was
silent
and
then
presently
became
audible
again
playing
with
a
ball
and
presumably
marjorie
tennis
racquet
directly
she
could
disentangle
herself
from
breakfast
pope
with
all
her
plans
acute
went
up
to
the
girls
room
she
found
her
daughter
dressing
in
a
leisurely
and
meditative
manner
she
shut
the
door
almost
confidentially
marjorie
she
said
i
want
you
to
tell
me
all
about
this
i
thought
i
heard
father
telling
you
said
marjorie
he
was
too
indignant
said
pope
to
explain
clearly
you
see
marjorie
she
paused
before
her
effort
he
knows
things
about
this
professor
trafford
what
things
asked
marjorie
turning
sharply
i
do
know
my
dear
and
i
ca
imagine
she
looked
out
of
the
window
aware
of
marjorie
entirely
distrustful
scrutiny
i
do
believe
it
said
marjorie
do
believe
what
dear
whatever
he
says
i
wish
i
did
said
pope
and
turned
oh
madge
she
cried
you
can
not
imagine
how
all
this
distresses
me
i
can
not
i
can
not
conceive
how
you
came
to
be
in
such
a
position
surely
honour
think
of
mr
magnet
how
good
and
patient
he
has
been
you
do
know
that
man
you
do
know
all
he
is
and
all
that
it
means
to
a
girl
he
is
good
and
honourable
and
pure
he
is
kindness
itself
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
were
to
be
so
happy
rich
honoured
she
was
overcome
by
a
rush
of
emotion
she
turned
to
the
bed
and
sat
down
she
said
desolately
it
all
ruined
shattered
gone
marjorie
tried
not
to
feel
that
her
mother
was
right
if
father
had
interfered
she
said
weakly
oh
do
my
dear
speak
so
coldly
of
your
father
you
do
know
what
he
has
to
put
up
with
you
do
know
his
troubles
and
anxieties
all
this
wretched
business
she
paused
and
her
face
became
portentous
marjorie
do
you
know
if
these
railways
go
on
as
they
are
going
he
may
have
to
into
his
this
year
just
think
of
that
and
the
worry
he
has
and
this
last
shame
and
anxiety
her
voice
broke
again
marjorie
listened
with
an
expression
that
was
almost
sullen
but
what
is
it
she
asked
that
father
knows
about
mr
trafford
i
do
know
dear
i
do
know
but
it
something
that
matters
that
makes
it
all
different
well
may
i
speak
to
trafford
before
he
leaves
buryhamstreet
my
dear
never
see
him
dear
never
think
of
him
again
your
father
would
not
dream
some
day
marjorie
you
will
rejoice
you
will
want
to
thank
your
father
on
your
bended
knees
that
he
saved
you
from
the
clutches
of
this
man
i
wo
believe
anything
about
trafford
she
said
slowly
until
i
know
she
left
the
sentence
incomplete
she
made
her
declaration
abruptly
i
love
trafford
she
said
with
a
catch
in
her
voice
and
i
do
love
mr
magnet
pope
received
this
like
one
who
is
suddenly
stabbed
she
sat
still
as
if
overwhelmed
one
hand
pressed
to
her
side
and
her
eyes
closed
then
she
said
as
if
she
gasped
involuntarily
it
too
dreadful
marjorie
she
said
i
want
to
ask
you
to
do
something
after
all
a
mother
has
claim
will
you
wait
just
a
little
will
you
promise
me
to
do
nothing
nothing
i
mean
to
commit
you
until
your
father
has
been
able
to
make
inquiries
do
him
for
a
little
while
very
soon
you
be
and
then
perhaps
things
may
be
different
if
he
cares
for
you
and
you
for
him
a
little
separation
wo
matter
until
your
father
has
inquired
mother
said
marjorie
i
ca
pope
drew
in
the
air
sharply
between
her
teeth
as
if
in
agony
but
mother
mother
i
let
trafford
know
that
i
not
to
see
him
i
suddenly
cease
if
i
could
see
him
once
do
said
pope
in
a
hollow
voice
marjorie
began
weeping
he
not
understand
she
said
if
i
might
just
speak
to
him
not
alone
marjorie
marjorie
stood
still
well
before
you
pope
conceded
the
point
and
then
marjorie
she
said
i
keep
my
word
mother
said
marjorie
and
began
to
sob
in
a
manner
she
felt
to
be
absurdly
childish
until
until
i
am
promise
that
pope
did
a
brief
calculation
marjorie
she
said
it
only
your
happiness
i
think
of
i
know
said
marjorie
and
added
in
a
low
voice
and
father
my
dear
you
do
understand
your
father
i
believe
i
do
firmly
believe
if
anything
happened
to
any
of
you
girls
anything
bad
he
would
kill
himself
and
i
know
he
means
that
you
are
to
go
about
so
much
as
you
used
to
do
unless
we
have
the
most
definite
promises
of
course
your
father
ideas
are
always
my
ideas
marjorie
but
your
duty
you
know
how
hasty
he
is
and
quick
just
as
you
know
how
good
and
generous
and
kind
he
is
she
caught
marjorie
eye
and
added
a
little
lamely
at
bottom
she
thought
i
think
i
could
get
him
to
let
you
say
just
one
word
with
trafford
it
would
be
very
difficult
but
she
paused
for
a
few
seconds
and
seemed
to
be
thinking
deeply
marjorie
she
said
mr
magnet
must
never
know
anything
of
this
but
mother
nothing
i
ca
go
on
with
my
engagement
pope
shook
her
head
inscrutably
but
how
i
mother
you
need
not
tell
him
marjorie
but
just
think
how
it
would
humiliate
and
distress
him
you
marjorie
you
must
find
some
excuse
oh
any
excuse
but
not
the
truth
not
the
truth
marjorie
it
would
be
too
dreadful
marjorie
thought
look
here
mother
i
see
trafford
again
i
really
speak
to
him
have
i
promised
then
i
do
as
you
say
said
marjorie
pope
found
her
husband
seated
at
the
desk
in
the
study
meditating
gloomily
i
been
talking
to
her
she
said
she
in
a
state
of
terrible
distress
she
ought
to
be
said
pope
philip
you
do
understand
marjorie
i
do
you
think
she
was
kissing
that
man
well
she
was
you
can
think
of
her
pope
turned
his
chair
to
her
but
i
pope
shook
her
head
she
was
she
was
struggling
to
get
away
from
him
she
told
me
so
herself
i
been
into
it
with
her
you
understand
philip
a
man
like
that
has
a
sort
of
fascination
for
a
girl
he
dazzles
her
it
the
way
with
girls
but
you
quite
mistaken
quite
it
a
sort
of
hypnotism
she
grow
out
of
it
of
course
she
mr
magnet
she
does
indeed
i
not
a
doubt
of
it
but
you
she
was
kissing
him
positive
then
why
did
you
say
so
a
girl
so
complex
you
did
give
her
a
chance
she
fearfully
ashamed
of
herself
fearfully
but
it
just
because
she
ashamed
that
she
wo
admit
it
i
make
her
admit
it
you
ought
to
have
had
all
boys
said
pope
oh
she
admit
it
some
day
readily
enough
but
i
believe
a
girl
of
her
spirit
would
rather
than
begin
explaining
you
ca
expect
it
of
her
really
you
ca
he
grunted
and
shook
his
head
slowly
from
side
to
side
she
sat
down
in
the
beside
the
desk
i
want
to
know
just
exactly
what
we
are
to
do
about
the
girl
philip
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
her
up
there
how
he
asked
up
there
yes
she
answered
with
that
skilful
inconsecutiveness
of
hers
and
let
a
brief
silence
touch
his
imagination
do
you
think
that
man
means
to
come
here
again
she
asked
chuck
him
out
if
he
does
said
pope
grimly
she
pressed
her
lips
together
firmly
she
seemed
to
be
weighing
things
painfully
i
would
she
said
at
last
what
do
you
mean
asked
pope
i
do
not
want
you
to
make
an
open
quarrel
with
mr
trafford
quarrel
not
an
open
one
said
pope
of
course
i
know
how
nice
it
would
be
if
you
use
a
horsewhip
dear
there
such
a
lot
of
things
if
we
only
just
slash
but
it
wo
help
get
him
to
go
away
she
consented
never
to
see
him
again
practically
she
ready
to
tell
him
so
herself
part
them
against
their
will
oh
and
the
thing
may
go
on
for
no
end
of
time
but
treat
it
as
it
ought
to
be
treated
she
be
very
tragic
for
a
week
or
so
and
then
she
forget
him
like
a
dream
he
a
dream
a
girl
dream
if
only
we
leave
it
alone
leave
it
alone
things
were
getting
straight
pope
felt
she
had
now
merely
to
add
a
few
touches
to
the
tranquillization
of
daphne
and
the
misdirection
of
the
twin
curiosity
these
touches
accomplished
it
seemed
that
everything
was
done
after
a
brief
reflection
she
dismissed
the
idea
of
putting
things
to
theodore
she
ran
over
the
possibilities
of
the
servants
eavesdropping
and
found
them
negligible
yes
everything
was
done
everything
and
yet
the
queer
string
in
her
nature
between
religiosity
and
superstition
began
to
vibrate
she
hesitated
then
she
slipped
upstairs
fastened
the
door
fell
on
her
knees
beside
the
bed
and
put
the
whole
thing
as
acceptably
as
possible
to
heaven
in
a
silent
simple
but
lucidly
explanatory
prayer
she
came
out
of
her
chamber
brighter
and
braver
than
she
had
been
for
eighteen
long
hours
she
could
now
she
felt
await
the
developments
that
threatened
with
the
serenity
of
one
who
is
prepared
at
every
point
she
went
almost
happily
to
the
kitchen
only
about
minutes
behind
her
usual
time
to
order
the
day
meals
and
see
with
her
own
eyes
that
economies
prevailed
and
it
seemed
to
her
on
the
whole
consoling
and
at
any
rate
a
distraction
when
the
cook
informed
her
that
after
all
she
meant
to
give
notice
on
the
day
of
aunt
plessington
visit
the
unsuspecting
magnet
fatigued
but
happy
for
three
hours
of
solid
humorous
writing
omitting
every
unpleasant
suggestion
and
mingling
in
the
most
acceptable
and
saleable
proportions
smiles
and
tears
had
added
its
quota
to
the
intellectual
heritage
of
england
made
a
simple
light
lunch
cooked
in
homely
fashion
lit
a
well
merited
cigar
and
turned
his
steps
towards
the
vicarage
he
was
preceded
at
some
distance
along
the
avenuesque
drive
by
the
back
of
trafford
which
he
made
no
attempt
to
overtake
trafford
was
admitted
and
disappeared
and
a
minute
afterwards
magnet
reached
the
door
pope
appeared
radiant
about
the
weather
a
rather
tiresome
man
had
just
called
upon
pope
about
business
matters
she
said
and
he
might
be
detained
five
or
ten
minutes
marjorie
and
daffy
were
upstairs
resting
they
had
been
disturbed
by
bats
in
the
night
is
it
charmingly
rural
said
pope
she
talked
about
bats
and
the
fear
she
had
of
their
getting
in
her
hair
and
as
she
talked
she
led
the
way
brightly
but
firmly
as
far
as
possible
out
of
earshot
of
the
windows
of
the
ultra
protestant
study
in
which
pope
was
now
she
did
so
hope
temperately
interviewing
trafford
directly
trafford
had
reached
the
front
door
it
had
opened
for
him
and
closed
behind
him
at
once
he
had
found
himself
with
pope
you
wish
to
see
my
husband
she
had
said
and
had
led
him
to
the
study
forthwith
she
had
returned
at
once
to
intercept
mr
magnet
trafford
found
pope
seated
sternly
at
the
centre
of
the
writing
desk
regarding
him
with
a
threatening
brow
well
sir
said
pope
breaking
the
silence
you
have
come
to
offer
some
explanation
while
awaiting
this
encounter
pope
had
not
been
insensitive
to
the
tactical
and
scenic
possibilities
of
the
occasion
in
fact
he
had
spent
the
latter
half
of
the
morning
in
intermittent
preparations
arranging
desks
books
hassocks
in
advantageous
positions
and
not
even
neglecting
such
small
details
as
the
stamp
tray
the
articles
of
interest
from
jerusalem
and
the
cenotaph
which
he
had
exhibited
in
such
a
manner
as
was
most
calculated
to
damp
chill
and
subjugate
an
antagonist
in
the
exposed
area
towards
the
window
he
had
also
arranged
the
chairs
in
a
highly
favourable
pattern
trafford
was
greatly
taken
aback
by
pope
juridical
manner
and
by
this
form
of
address
and
he
was
further
put
out
by
pope
saying
with
a
regal
gesture
to
the
best
illuminated
and
most
isolated
chair
be
seated
sir
trafford
exordium
vanished
from
his
mind
he
was
at
a
loss
for
words
until
spurred
to
speech
by
pope
almost
truculent
well
i
am
in
love
sir
with
your
daughter
i
am
not
aware
of
it
said
pope
and
lifted
and
dropped
the
my
daughter
sir
is
engaged
to
marry
mr
magnet
if
you
had
approached
me
in
a
proper
fashion
before
presuming
to
attempt
to
attempt
his
voice
thickened
with
indignation
liberties
with
her
you
would
have
been
duly
informed
of
her
position
and
everyone
would
have
been
saved
he
lifted
the
everything
that
has
happened
bump
trafford
had
to
adjust
himself
to
the
unexpected
elements
in
this
encounter
oh
he
said
yes
said
pope
and
there
was
a
distinct
interval
is
your
daughter
in
love
with
mr
magnet
asked
trafford
in
an
almost
colloquial
tone
pope
smiled
gravely
i
presume
so
sir
she
never
gave
me
that
impression
anyhow
said
the
young
man
it
was
neither
her
duty
to
give
nor
yours
to
receive
that
impression
said
pope
again
trafford
was
at
a
loss
have
you
come
here
sir
merely
to
bandy
words
asked
pope
drumming
with
ten
fingers
on
the
table
trafford
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
and
assumed
a
fictitious
pose
of
ease
he
had
never
found
any
one
in
his
life
before
quite
so
provocative
of
colloquialism
as
pope
look
here
sir
this
is
all
very
well
he
began
but
why
ca
i
fall
in
love
with
your
daughter
i
a
doctor
of
science
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
i
a
perfectly
decent
outlook
my
father
was
rather
a
swell
in
his
science
i
an
entirely
decent
and
respectable
person
i
beg
to
differ
said
pope
but
i
am
again
said
pope
with
great
patience
and
a
slight
forward
bowing
of
the
head
i
beg
to
differ
well
differ
but
all
the
same
he
paused
and
began
again
and
for
a
time
they
argued
to
no
purpose
they
generalized
about
the
position
of
an
engaged
girl
and
the
rights
and
privileges
of
a
father
then
pope
to
cut
all
this
short
told
him
frankly
he
was
wanted
his
daughter
did
not
want
him
nobody
wanted
him
he
was
an
invader
he
had
to
be
got
rid
of
if
possible
by
peaceful
means
trafford
disputed
these
propositions
and
asked
to
see
marjorie
pope
had
been
leading
up
to
this
and
at
once
closed
with
that
request
she
is
as
anxious
as
any
one
to
end
this
intolerable
siege
he
said
he
went
to
the
door
and
called
for
marjorie
who
appeared
with
conspicuous
promptitude
she
was
in
a
dress
of
green
linen
that
made
her
seem
very
cool
as
well
as
very
dignified
to
trafford
she
was
tense
with
restrained
excitement
and
either
for
these
things
shade
into
each
other
entirely
without
a
disposition
to
act
her
part
or
acting
with
consummate
ability
trafford
rose
at
the
sight
of
her
and
remained
standing
pope
closed
the
door
and
walked
back
to
the
desk
trafford
has
to
be
told
he
said
that
you
do
want
him
in
buryhamstreet
he
arrested
marjorie
forward
movement
towards
trafford
by
a
gesture
of
the
hand
seated
himself
and
resumed
his
drumming
on
the
table
well
he
said
i
do
think
you
ought
to
stay
in
buryhamstreet
trafford
said
marjorie
you
do
want
me
to
it
will
only
cause
trouble
and
scenes
you
want
me
to
go
away
from
here
you
really
mean
that
marjorie
did
not
answer
for
a
little
time
she
seemed
to
be
weighing
the
exact
force
of
all
she
was
going
to
say
trafford
she
answered
everything
i
ever
said
to
you
everything
i
more
than
i
ever
meant
anything
everything
a
little
flush
of
colour
came
into
trafford
cheeks
he
regarded
marjorie
with
a
brightening
eye
oh
well
he
said
i
do
understand
but
i
entirely
in
your
hands
of
course
marjorie
pose
and
expression
altered
for
an
instant
she
was
a
miracle
of
instinctive
expression
she
shone
at
him
she
conveyed
herself
to
him
she
assured
him
her
eyes
met
his
she
stood
warmly
flushed
and
quite
unconquered
visibly
magnificently
she
poured
into
him
just
that
riotous
pride
and
admiration
that
gives
a
man
altogether
to
a
woman
then
it
seemed
as
if
a
light
passed
and
she
was
just
an
everyday
marjorie
standing
there
i
do
anything
you
want
me
to
said
trafford
then
i
want
you
to
go
ah
said
pope
yes
said
trafford
with
his
eyes
on
her
i
promised
not
to
write
or
send
to
you
or
think
more
than
i
can
help
of
you
until
i
nearly
two
months
from
now
and
then
i
do
know
how
can
i
you
hear
sir
from
pope
in
the
pause
of
mutual
scrutiny
that
followed
one
question
said
trafford
you
surely
asked
enough
sir
said
pope
are
you
still
engaged
to
magnet
sir
please
father
said
marjorie
with
unusual
daring
and
in
her
voice
trafford
after
what
i
told
you
you
must
leave
that
to
me
she
engaged
to
mr
magnet
said
pope
tell
him
outright
marjorie
make
it
clear
i
think
i
understand
said
trafford
with
his
eyes
on
marjorie
i
not
seen
mr
magnet
since
last
night
said
marjorie
and
so
naturally
i
still
engaged
to
him
precisely
said
pope
and
turned
with
a
face
of
harsh
interrogation
to
his
importunate
caller
trafford
seemed
disposed
for
further
questions
i
do
think
we
need
detain
you
madge
said
pope
over
his
shoulder
the
two
young
people
stood
facing
one
another
for
a
moment
and
i
am
afraid
that
they
were
both
extremely
happy
and
satisfied
with
each
other
it
was
all
right
they
were
quite
sure
all
right
their
lips
were
almost
smiling
then
marjorie
made
an
entirely
dignified
exit
she
closed
the
door
very
softly
and
pope
turned
to
his
visitor
again
with
a
bleak
politeness
i
hope
that
satisfies
you
he
said
there
is
nothing
more
to
be
said
at
present
i
admit
said
trafford
nothing
said
pope
both
gentlemen
bowed
pope
rose
ceremoniously
and
trafford
walked
doorward
he
had
a
sense
of
latent
absurdities
in
these
tremendous
attitudes
they
passed
through
the
hall
processionally
but
just
at
the
end
some
lower
strain
in
trafford
nature
touched
the
fine
dignity
of
the
occasion
with
an
inappropriate
remark
sir
said
pope
holding
the
housedoor
wide
sir
said
trafford
and
then
added
with
a
note
of
untimely
intimacy
in
his
voice
with
an
inexcusable
levity
upon
his
lips
you
know
there
nobody
no
man
in
the
world
i
sooner
have
for
a
than
you
pope
caught
unprepared
on
the
spur
of
the
moment
bowed
in
a
cold
and
distant
manner
and
then
almost
immediately
closed
the
door
to
save
himself
from
violence
from
first
to
last
neither
gentleman
had
made
the
slightest
allusion
to
a
considerable
bruise
upon
trafford
left
cheek
and
a
large
abrasion
above
his
ear
that
afternoon
marjorie
began
her
difficult
task
of
getting
disengaged
from
mr
magnet
it
was
difficult
because
she
was
pledged
not
to
tell
him
of
the
one
thing
that
made
this
line
of
action
not
only
explicable
but
necessary
magnet
perplexed
and
disconcerted
and
secretly
sustained
by
her
mother
glancing
sidelights
on
the
feminine
character
and
the
instability
of
girlish
whims
remained
at
buryhamstreet
until
the
family
returned
to
hartstone
square
the
engagement
was
ended
formally
but
in
such
a
manner
that
magnet
was
left
a
rather
pathetic
and
invincibly
assiduous
besieger
he
lavished
little
presents
upon
both
sisters
he
devised
little
treats
for
the
entire
family
he
enriched
theodore
beyond
the
dreams
of
avarice
and
he
discussed
his
love
and
admiration
for
marjorie
and
the
perplexities
and
delicacies
of
the
situation
not
only
with
pope
but
with
daphne
at
first
he
had
thought
very
little
of
daphne
but
now
he
was
beginning
to
experience
the
subtle
pleasures
of
a
confidential
friendship
she
understood
he
felt
it
was
quite
wonderful
how
she
understood
he
found
daffy
much
richer
in
response
than
marjorie
and
far
less
disconcerting
in
reply
pope
for
all
marjorie
submission
to
his
wishes
developed
a
grand
dudgeon
of
exceptionally
fine
proportions
when
he
heard
of
the
breach
of
the
engagement
he
ceased
to
speak
to
his
daughter
or
admit
himself
aware
of
her
existence
and
the
grand
dudgeon
blighting
shadow
threw
a
chill
over
the
life
of
every
one
in
the
house
he
made
it
clear
that
the
grand
dudgeon
would
only
be
lifted
by
marjorie
to
magnet
and
that
whatever
blight
or
inconvenience
fell
on
the
others
was
due
entirely
to
marjorie
wicked
obstinacy
using
pope
as
an
intermediary
he
also
conveyed
to
marjorie
his
decision
to
be
no
longer
burthened
with
the
charges
of
her
education
at
oxbridge
and
he
made
it
seem
extremely
doubtful
whether
he
should
remember
her
approaching
birthday
marjorie
received
the
news
of
her
severance
from
oxbridge
pope
thought
with
a
certain
hardness
i
thought
he
would
do
that
said
marjorie
he
always
wanted
to
do
that
and
said
no
more
chapter
the
fifth
a
telephone
call
trafford
went
back
to
solomonson
for
a
day
or
so
and
then
to
london
to
resume
the
experimental
work
of
the
research
he
had
in
hand
but
he
was
so
much
in
love
with
marjorie
that
for
some
days
it
was
a
very
dazed
mind
that
fumbled
with
the
apparatus
arranged
it
and
rearranged
it
and
fell
into
daydreams
that
gave
the
utmost
concern
to
durgan
the
he
not
going
straight
at
things
said
durgan
the
to
his
wife
he
usually
goes
so
straight
at
things
it
a
pleasure
to
watch
it
he
told
me
he
was
going
down
into
kent
to
think
everything
out
durgan
paused
impressively
and
spoke
with
a
sigh
of
perplexity
he
has
but
later
durgan
was
able
to
report
that
trafford
had
pulled
himself
together
the
work
was
moving
i
was
worried
for
a
bit
said
durgan
but
i
it
all
right
again
i
it
all
right
again
trafford
was
one
of
those
rare
scientific
men
who
really
ought
to
be
engaged
in
scientific
research
he
could
never
leave
an
accepted
formula
alone
his
mind
was
like
some
insatiable
corrosive
that
ate
into
all
the
hidden
inequalities
and
plastered
weaknesses
of
accepted
theories
and
bit
its
way
through
every
plausibility
of
appearance
he
was
extraordinarily
fertile
in
exasperating
alternative
hypotheses
his
invention
of
destructive
test
experiments
was
as
happy
as
the
respectful
irony
with
which
he
brought
them
into
contact
with
the
generalizations
they
doomed
he
was
already
at
hated
abused
obstructed
and
respected
he
was
still
outside
the
royal
society
of
course
and
the
editors
of
the
scientific
periodicals
admired
his
papers
greatly
and
delayed
publication
but
it
was
fairly
certain
that
that
pressure
of
foreign
criticism
and
competition
which
prevents
english
scientific
men
of
good
family
and
social
position
from
maintaining
any
such
national
standards
as
we
are
able
to
do
in
art
literature
and
politics
would
finally
carry
him
in
and
since
he
had
a
small
professorship
worth
three
hundred
a
year
which
gave
him
the
command
of
a
sufficient
research
laboratory
and
the
services
of
durgan
a
private
income
of
nearly
three
hundred
more
a
devoted
mother
to
keep
house
for
him
and
an
invincible
faith
in
truth
he
had
every
prospect
of
winning
in
his
particular
struggle
to
inflict
more
truth
new
lucidities
and
fresh
powers
upon
this
fractious
and
unreasonable
universe
in
the
world
of
science
now
even
more
than
in
the
world
of
literature
and
political
thought
the
thing
that
is
alive
struggles
amidst
a
copious
production
of
things
born
dead
the
endowment
of
research
the
organization
of
scientific
progress
the
creation
of
salaried
posts
and
the
assignment
of
honours
has
attracted
to
this
field
just
that
type
of
man
which
is
least
gifted
to
penetrate
and
discover
and
least
able
to
admit
its
own
defect
or
the
quality
of
a
superior
such
men
are
producing
great
bulky
masses
of
imitative
research
futile
inquiries
and
monstrous
entanglements
of
technicality
about
their
subjects
and
it
is
to
their
instinctive
antagonism
to
the
idea
of
a
gift
in
such
things
that
we
owe
the
preposterous
conception
of
a
training
for
research
the
manufacture
of
mental
blinkers
that
is
to
say
to
avoid
what
is
the
very
soul
of
brilliant
inquiry
applicable
discursiveness
the
trained
investigator
is
quite
the
absurdest
figure
in
the
farce
of
contemporary
intellectual
life
he
is
like
a
perpetually
starting
to
cross
the
himalayas
by
virtue
of
a
licence
to
do
so
for
such
enterprises
one
must
have
wings
organization
and
genius
are
antipathetic
the
vivid
and
creative
mind
by
virtue
of
its
qualities
is
a
spasmodic
and
adventurous
mind
it
resents
blinkers
and
the
mere
implication
that
it
can
be
driven
in
harness
to
the
unexpected
it
demands
freedom
it
resents
regular
attendance
from
ten
to
four
and
punctualities
in
general
and
all
those
paralyzing
minor
tests
of
conduct
that
are
vitally
important
to
the
imagination
of
the
authoritative
dull
consequently
it
is
being
eliminated
from
its
legitimate
field
and
it
is
only
here
and
there
among
the
younger
men
that
such
a
figure
as
trafford
gives
any
promise
of
a
renewal
of
that
enthusiasm
that
intellectual
enterprise
which
were
distinctive
of
the
great
age
of
scientific
advance
trafford
was
the
only
son
of
his
parents
his
father
had
been
a
young
surgeon
more
attracted
by
knowledge
than
practice
who
had
been
killed
by
a
scratch
of
the
scalpel
in
an
investigation
upon
ulcerative
processes
at
the
age
of
trafford
at
that
time
was
three
years
old
so
that
he
had
not
the
least
memory
of
his
father
but
his
mother
by
a
thousand
almost
unpremeditated
touches
had
built
up
a
figure
for
him
and
a
tradition
that
was
shaping
his
life
she
had
loved
her
husband
passionately
and
when
he
died
her
love
burnt
up
like
a
flame
released
and
made
a
god
of
the
good
she
had
known
with
him
she
was
then
a
very
beautiful
and
woman
of
thirty
and
she
did
her
best
to
reconstruct
her
life
but
she
could
find
nothing
so
living
in
the
world
as
the
clear
courage
the
essential
simplicity
and
tender
memories
of
the
man
she
had
lost
and
she
was
the
more
devoted
to
him
that
he
had
had
little
weaknesses
of
temper
and
bearing
and
that
an
outrageous
campaign
had
been
waged
against
him
that
did
not
cease
with
his
death
he
had
in
some
medical
periodical
published
drawings
of
a
dead
dog
clamped
to
display
a
deformity
and
these
had
been
seized
upon
by
a
group
of
fanatics
as
the
representation
of
a
vivisection
a
libel
action
had
been
pending
when
he
died
but
there
is
no
protection
of
the
dead
from
libel
that
monstrous
lie
met
her
on
pamphlet
cover
on
hoardings
in
sensational
appeals
it
seemed
immortal
and
she
would
have
suffered
the
pains
of
a
dozen
suttees
if
she
could
have
done
so
to
show
the
world
how
the
power
and
tenderness
of
this
alleged
tormentor
of
helpless
beasts
had
gripped
one
heart
it
counted
enormously
in
her
decision
to
remain
a
widow
and
concentrate
her
life
upon
her
son
she
watched
his
growth
with
a
care
and
passionate
subtlety
that
even
at
he
was
still
far
from
suspecting
she
dreaded
his
becoming
a
mother
pet
she
sent
him
away
to
school
and
fretted
through
long
terms
alone
that
he
might
be
made
into
a
man
she
interested
herself
in
literary
work
and
social
affairs
lest
she
should
press
upon
him
unduly
she
listened
for
the
crude
expression
of
growing
thought
in
him
with
an
intensity
that
was
almost
anguish
she
was
too
intelligent
to
dream
of
forming
his
mind
he
browsed
on
every
doctrine
to
find
his
own
but
she
did
desire
most
passionately
she
prayed
she
prayed
in
the
darkness
of
sleepless
nights
that
the
views
the
breadths
the
spacious
emotions
which
had
ennobled
her
husband
in
her
eyes
should
rise
again
in
him
there
were
years
of
doubt
and
waiting
he
was
a
good
boy
and
a
bad
boy
now
brilliant
now
touching
now
disappointing
now
gloriously
reassuring
and
now
as
only
the
children
of
our
blood
can
be
he
had
errors
and
bad
moments
lapses
into
sheer
naughtiness
phases
of
indolence
attacks
of
contagious
vulgarity
but
more
and
more
surely
she
saw
him
for
his
father
son
she
traced
the
same
great
curiosities
the
same
keen
dauntless
questioning
whatever
incidents
might
disturb
and
perplex
her
his
intellectual
growth
went
on
strong
and
clear
and
increasing
like
some
sacred
flame
that
is
carried
in
procession
halting
perhaps
and
swaying
a
little
but
keeping
on
over
the
heads
of
a
tumultuous
crowd
he
went
from
his
school
to
the
royal
college
of
science
thence
to
successes
at
cambridge
and
thence
to
berlin
he
travelled
a
little
in
asia
minor
and
persia
had
a
journey
to
america
and
then
came
back
to
her
and
london
sunburnt
moustached
manly
and
a
little
strange
when
he
had
been
a
boy
she
had
thought
his
very
soul
pellucid
it
had
clouded
opaquely
against
her
scrutiny
as
he
passed
into
adolescence
then
through
the
period
of
visits
and
departures
travel
together
separations
he
grew
into
something
detached
and
admirable
a
man
curiously
reminiscent
of
his
father
unexpectedly
different
she
ceased
to
feel
what
he
was
feeling
in
his
mind
had
to
watch
him
infer
guess
speculate
about
him
she
desired
for
him
and
dreaded
for
him
with
an
undying
tenderness
but
she
no
longer
had
any
assurance
that
she
could
interfere
to
help
him
he
had
his
father
trick
of
falling
into
thought
her
brown
eyes
would
watch
him
across
the
flowers
and
delicate
glass
and
silver
of
her
dinner
table
when
he
dined
at
home
with
her
sometimes
he
seemed
to
forget
she
existed
sometimes
he
delighted
in
her
talked
to
amuse
her
petted
her
sometimes
and
then
it
was
she
was
happiest
he
talked
of
plays
and
books
with
her
discussed
general
questions
spoke
even
of
that
broadly
conceived
scheme
of
work
which
engaged
so
much
of
his
imagination
she
knew
that
it
was
distinguished
and
powerful
work
old
friends
of
her
husband
spoke
of
it
to
her
praised
its
inspired
directness
its
beautiful
simplicity
since
the
days
of
wollaston
they
said
no
one
had
been
so
witty
an
experimenter
no
one
had
got
more
out
of
mere
scraps
of
apparatus
or
contrived
more
ingenious
simplifications
when
he
had
accepted
the
minor
professorship
which
gave
him
a
footing
in
the
world
of
responsible
scientific
men
she
had
taken
a
house
in
a
quiet
street
in
chelsea
which
necessitated
a
daily
walk
to
his
laboratory
it
was
a
little
old
georgian
house
with
worn
and
graceful
rooms
a
dignified
front
door
and
a
fine
gateway
of
sussex
ironwork
much
painted
and
eaten
away
she
arranged
it
with
great
care
she
had
kept
most
of
her
furniture
and
his
study
had
his
father
bureau
and
the
selfsame
agate
that
had
pressed
the
unfinished
paper
he
left
when
he
died
she
was
a
woman
of
persistent
friendships
and
there
came
to
her
old
connections
of
those
early
times
trailing
fresher
and
younger
people
in
their
wake
sons
daughters
nephews
disciples
her
son
brought
home
all
sorts
of
interesting
men
and
it
was
remarkable
to
her
that
amidst
the
talk
and
discussion
at
her
table
she
discovered
aspects
of
her
son
and
often
quite
intimate
aspects
she
would
never
have
seen
with
him
alone
she
would
not
let
herself
believe
that
this
indian
summer
of
her
life
could
last
for
ever
he
was
no
passionless
devotee
of
research
for
all
his
silence
and
restraints
she
had
seen
him
kindle
with
anger
at
obstacles
and
absurdities
and
quicken
in
the
presence
of
beauty
she
knew
how
readily
and
richly
he
responded
to
beauty
things
happened
to
have
run
smoothly
with
him
so
far
that
was
all
of
course
she
said
he
must
fall
in
love
it
can
not
be
long
before
he
falls
in
love
once
or
twice
that
had
seemed
to
happen
and
then
it
had
come
to
nothing
she
knew
that
sooner
or
later
this
completion
of
his
possibilities
must
come
that
the
present
steadfastness
of
purpose
was
a
phase
in
which
forces
gathered
that
love
must
sweep
into
his
life
as
a
deep
and
passionate
disturbance
she
wondered
where
it
would
take
him
whether
it
would
leave
him
enriched
or
devastated
she
saw
at
times
how
young
he
was
she
had
as
i
suppose
most
older
people
have
about
their
juniors
the
profoundest
doubt
whether
he
was
wise
enough
yet
to
be
trusted
with
a
thing
so
good
as
himself
he
had
flashes
of
indiscretion
and
at
times
a
wildfire
of
humour
flared
in
his
talk
so
far
that
had
done
no
worse
for
him
than
make
an
enemy
or
so
in
scientific
circles
but
she
had
no
idea
of
the
limits
of
his
excitability
she
would
watch
him
and
fear
for
him
she
knew
the
wreckage
love
can
make
and
also
she
desired
that
he
should
lose
nothing
that
life
and
his
nature
could
give
him
in
the
two
months
of
separation
that
ensued
before
marjorie
was
trafford
mind
went
through
some
remarkable
phases
at
first
the
excitement
of
his
passion
for
marjorie
obscured
everything
else
then
with
his
return
to
london
and
his
laboratory
the
immense
inertia
of
habit
and
slowly
developed
purposes
the
complex
yet
convergent
system
of
ideas
and
problems
to
which
so
much
of
his
life
had
been
given
began
to
reassert
itself
his
love
was
vivid
and
intense
a
light
in
his
imagination
a
fever
in
his
blood
but
it
was
a
new
thing
it
had
not
crept
into
the
flesh
and
bones
of
his
being
it
was
away
there
in
surrey
the
streets
of
london
his
home
the
chamber
with
its
skylight
and
high
windows
and
charts
of
constants
in
which
his
apparatus
was
arranged
had
no
suggestion
of
her
she
was
outside
an
adventure
a
perplexing
incommensurable
with
all
these
things
he
had
left
buryhamstreet
with
marjorie
riotously
in
possession
of
his
mind
he
could
think
of
nothing
but
marjorie
in
the
train
and
how
she
had
shone
at
him
in
the
study
and
how
her
voice
had
sounded
when
she
spoke
and
how
she
stood
and
moved
and
the
shape
and
sensation
of
her
hands
and
how
it
had
felt
to
hold
her
for
those
brief
moments
in
the
wood
and
press
lips
and
body
to
his
and
how
her
face
had
gleamed
in
the
laced
shadows
of
the
moonlight
soft
and
wonderful
in
fact
he
thought
of
marjorie
he
thought
she
was
splendid
courageous
wise
by
instinct
he
had
no
doubt
of
her
or
that
she
was
to
be
his
when
the
weeks
of
waiting
had
passed
by
she
was
his
and
he
was
marjorie
that
had
been
settled
from
the
beginning
of
the
world
it
did
occur
to
him
that
anything
had
happened
to
alter
his
life
or
any
of
his
arrangements
in
any
way
except
that
they
were
altogether
altered
as
the
world
is
altered
without
displacement
when
the
sun
pours
up
in
the
east
he
was
glorified
and
everything
was
glorified
he
wondered
how
they
would
meet
again
and
dreamt
a
thousand
impossible
and
stirring
dreams
but
he
dreamt
them
as
dreams
at
first
to
durgan
infinite
distress
he
thought
of
her
all
day
and
then
as
the
old
familiar
interests
grappled
him
again
he
thought
of
her
in
the
morning
and
the
evening
and
as
he
walked
between
his
home
and
the
laboratory
and
at
all
sorts
of
incidental
times
and
even
when
the
riddles
of
his
research
held
the
foreground
and
focus
of
his
thoughts
he
still
seemed
to
be
thinking
of
her
as
a
radiant
background
to
ions
and
molecules
and
atoms
and
interwoven
systems
of
eddies
and
quivering
oscillations
deep
down
in
the
very
heart
of
matter
and
always
he
thought
of
her
as
something
of
the
summer
the
rich
decays
of
autumn
came
the
chelsea
roads
were
littered
with
variegated
leaves
that
were
presently
wet
and
dirty
and
slippery
the
twilight
crept
down
into
the
day
towards
five
and
four
but
in
his
memory
of
her
the
leaves
were
green
the
evenings
were
long
the
warm
quiet
of
rural
surrey
in
high
august
filled
the
air
so
that
it
was
with
a
kind
of
amazement
he
found
her
in
london
and
in
november
close
at
hand
he
was
called
to
the
college
telephone
one
day
from
a
conversation
with
a
proposed
research
student
it
was
a
woman
bachelor
anxious
for
the
who
wished
to
occupy
the
further
bench
in
the
laboratory
but
she
had
no
mental
fire
and
his
mind
was
busy
with
excuses
and
discouragements
he
had
no
thought
of
marjorie
when
she
answered
and
for
an
instant
he
did
not
recognize
her
voice
yes
i
mr
who
is
it
he
reiterated
with
a
note
of
irascibility
the
little
voice
laughed
why
i
marjorie
it
said
then
she
was
back
in
his
life
like
a
lantern
suddenly
become
visible
in
a
wood
at
midnight
it
was
like
meeting
her
as
a
china
figure
neat
and
perfect
and
two
inches
high
it
was
her
voice
very
clear
and
very
bright
and
quite
characteristic
as
though
he
was
hearing
it
through
the
wrong
end
of
a
telescope
it
was
her
voice
clear
as
a
bell
confident
without
a
shadow
it
marjorie
i
it
was
like
a
little
arrow
of
exquisite
light
shot
into
the
very
heart
of
his
life
he
laughed
back
are
you
for
meeting
me
then
marjorie
they
met
in
kensington
gardens
with
an
air
of
being
clandestine
and
defiant
it
was
one
of
those
days
of
amber
sunlight
soft
air
and
tender
beauty
with
which
london
relieves
the
tragic
glooms
of
the
decline
there
were
still
a
residue
of
leaves
in
puffs
and
clusters
upon
the
tree
branches
a
boat
or
two
ruffled
the
blue
serpentine
and
the
waterfowl
gave
colour
and
animation
to
the
selvage
of
the
water
the
sedges
were
still
a
greenish
yellow
the
two
met
shyly
they
were
both
a
little
unfamiliar
to
each
other
trafford
was
a
decorous
young
professor
in
the
place
of
the
cheerful
aeronaut
who
had
fallen
so
gaily
out
of
the
sky
marjorie
had
a
new
dress
of
and
a
little
cloth
toque
ruled
and
disciplined
the
hair
he
had
known
as
a
ruddy
confusion
they
had
dreamt
i
think
of
extended
arms
and
a
wild
rush
to
embrace
one
another
instead
they
shook
hands
and
so
said
trafford
we
meet
again
i
do
see
why
we
should
meet
said
marjorie
there
was
a
slight
pause
let
have
two
of
those
jolly
little
green
chairs
said
trafford
they
walked
across
the
grass
towards
the
chairs
he
had
indicated
and
both
were
full
of
the
momentous
things
they
were
finding
it
impossible
to
say
there
ought
to
be
squirrels
here
as
there
are
in
new
york
he
said
at
last
they
sat
down
there
was
a
moment
silence
and
then
trafford
spirit
rose
in
rebellion
and
he
plunged
at
this
this
stranger
beside
him
look
here
he
said
do
you
still
love
me
marjorie
she
looked
up
into
his
face
with
eyes
in
which
surprise
and
scrutiny
passed
into
something
altogether
beautiful
i
love
you
altogether
she
said
in
a
steady
low
voice
and
suddenly
she
was
no
longer
a
stranger
but
the
girl
who
had
flitted
to
his
arms
breathless
unhesitating
through
the
dusk
his
blood
quickened
he
made
an
awkward
gesture
as
though
he
arrested
an
impulse
to
touch
her
my
sweetheart
he
said
my
dear
one
marjorie
face
flashed
responses
it
you
he
said
me
she
answered
do
you
remember
everything
my
dear
i
want
to
tell
you
things
said
marjorie
what
are
we
to
do
he
tried
afterwards
to
retrace
that
conversation
he
was
chiefly
ashamed
of
his
scientific
preoccupations
during
that
london
interval
he
had
thought
of
a
thousand
things
marjorie
had
thought
of
nothing
else
but
love
and
him
her
happy
assurance
her
absolute
confidence
that
his
desires
would
march
with
hers
reproached
and
confuted
every
adverse
thought
in
him
as
though
it
was
a
treachery
to
love
he
had
that
sense
which
i
suppose
comes
at
times
to
every
man
of
entire
unworthiness
for
the
straight
unhesitating
decision
the
clear
simplicity
of
a
passion
he
had
dreamt
vaguely
unsubstantially
the
while
he
had
arranged
his
pressures
and
temperatures
and
infinitesimal
ingredients
and
worked
with
goniometer
and
trial
models
and
the
new
calculating
machine
he
had
contrived
for
his
research
but
she
had
thought
clearly
definitely
fully
of
nothing
but
coming
to
him
she
had
thought
out
everything
that
bore
upon
that
reasons
for
preciptance
reasons
for
delay
she
had
weighed
the
rewards
of
conformity
against
the
glamour
of
romance
it
became
more
and
more
clear
to
him
as
they
talked
that
she
was
determined
to
elope
with
him
to
go
to
italy
and
there
have
an
extraordinarily
picturesque
and
beautiful
time
her
definiteness
shamed
his
poverty
of
anticipation
her
enthusiasm
carried
him
with
her
of
course
it
was
so
that
things
must
be
done
when
at
last
they
parted
under
the
multiplying
lamps
of
the
november
twilight
he
turned
his
face
eastward
he
was
afraid
of
his
eyes
he
scarcely
knew
why
he
walked
along
kensington
gore
and
the
clustering
confused
lights
of
street
and
house
white
and
golden
and
orange
and
pale
lilac
the
moving
lamps
and
shining
glitter
of
the
traffic
the
luminous
interiors
of
omnibuses
the
reflection
of
carriage
and
hoarding
the
fading
daylight
overhead
the
phantom
trees
to
the
left
the
deepening
shadows
and
blacknesses
among
the
houses
on
his
right
the
bobbing
heads
of
wayfarers
were
just
for
him
the
stir
and
hue
and
texture
of
fairyland
all
the
world
was
fairyland
he
went
to
his
club
and
dined
there
and
divided
the
evening
between
geography
as
it
is
condensed
in
baedeker
and
murray
on
north
italy
italian
switzerland
and
the
italian
riviera
and
a
study
of
the
marriage
laws
as
they
are
expounded
in
whitaker
almanac
the
encyclopædia
britannica
and
other
convenient
works
of
reference
he
replaced
the
books
as
he
used
them
and
went
at
last
from
the
library
into
the
but
seeing
a
man
who
might
talk
to
him
there
he
went
out
at
once
into
the
streets
and
fetched
a
wide
compass
by
baker
street
oxford
street
and
hyde
park
home
he
was
a
little
astonished
at
himself
and
everything
but
it
was
going
to
be
splendid
what
poor
things
words
can
be
he
found
his
mother
still
up
she
had
been
the
old
tale
and
she
sat
before
a
ruddy
fire
in
the
shadow
beyond
the
lit
circle
of
a
electric
light
thinking
with
the
book
put
aside
in
the
dimness
above
was
his
father
portrait
time
you
were
in
bed
mother
he
said
reprovingly
and
kissed
her
eyebrow
and
stood
above
her
what
the
book
he
asked
and
picked
it
up
and
put
it
down
forgotten
their
eyes
met
she
perceived
he
had
something
to
say
she
did
not
know
what
where
have
you
been
she
asked
he
told
her
and
they
lapsed
into
silence
she
asked
another
question
and
he
answered
her
and
the
indifferent
conversation
ended
again
the
silence
lengthened
then
he
plunged
i
wonder
mother
if
it
would
put
you
out
very
much
if
i
brought
home
a
wife
to
you
so
it
had
come
to
this
and
she
had
not
seen
it
coming
she
looked
into
the
glowing
recesses
of
the
fire
before
her
and
controlled
her
voice
by
an
effort
i
be
glad
for
you
to
do
it
dear
if
you
loved
her
she
said
very
quietly
he
stared
down
at
her
for
a
moment
then
he
knelt
down
beside
her
and
took
her
hand
and
kissed
it
she
whispered
softly
stroking
his
head
and
her
tears
came
streaming
for
a
time
they
said
no
more
presently
he
put
coal
on
the
fire
and
then
sitting
on
the
hearthrug
at
her
feet
and
looking
away
from
her
into
the
flames
in
an
attitude
that
took
her
back
to
his
boyhood
he
began
to
tell
her
brokenly
and
awkwardly
of
marjorie
it
so
hard
mother
to
explain
these
things
he
began
one
half
understand
the
things
that
are
happening
to
one
i
want
to
make
you
in
love
with
her
dear
just
as
i
am
and
i
do
see
how
i
can
perhaps
i
shall
understand
my
dear
perhaps
i
shall
understand
better
than
you
think
she
such
a
beautiful
thing
with
something
about
her
you
know
those
steel
blades
you
can
bend
back
to
the
hilt
and
they
steel
and
she
tender
it
as
if
someone
had
taken
tears
mother
and
made
a
spirit
out
of
them
she
caressed
and
stroked
his
hand
my
dear
she
said
i
know
and
a
sort
of
dancing
daring
in
her
eyes
yes
she
said
but
tell
me
where
she
comes
from
and
how
you
met
her
and
all
the
circumstantial
things
that
a
sensible
old
woman
can
understand
he
kissed
her
hand
and
sat
down
beside
her
with
his
shoulder
against
the
arm
of
her
chair
his
fingers
interlaced
about
his
knee
she
could
not
keep
her
touch
from
his
hair
and
she
tried
to
force
back
the
thought
in
her
mind
that
all
these
talks
must
end
that
very
soon
indeed
they
would
end
and
she
was
glad
full
of
pride
and
joy
too
that
her
son
was
a
lover
after
her
heart
a
clean
and
simple
lover
as
his
father
had
been
before
him
he
loved
this
unknown
marjorie
finely
sweetly
bravely
even
as
she
herself
could
have
desired
to
have
been
loved
she
told
herself
she
did
not
care
very
greatly
even
if
this
marjorie
should
prove
unworthy
so
long
as
her
son
was
not
unworthy
he
pieced
his
story
together
he
gave
her
a
picture
of
the
popes
marjorie
in
her
family
like
a
jewel
in
an
ugly
setting
so
it
seemed
to
him
and
the
queer
dull
rage
of
her
father
and
all
that
they
meant
to
do
she
tried
to
grasp
his
perplexities
and
advise
but
chiefly
she
was
filled
with
the
thought
that
he
was
in
love
if
he
wanted
a
girl
he
should
have
her
and
if
he
had
to
take
her
by
force
well
was
it
his
right
she
set
small
store
upon
the
popes
that
night
or
any
circumstances
and
since
she
herself
had
married
on
the
slightest
of
security
she
was
concerned
very
little
that
this
great
adventure
was
to
be
attempted
on
an
income
of
a
few
hundreds
a
year
it
was
outside
her
philosophy
that
a
wife
should
be
anything
but
glad
to
tramp
the
roads
if
need
be
with
the
man
who
loved
her
he
sketched
out
valiant
plans
was
for
taking
marjorie
away
in
the
teeth
of
all
opposition
and
bringing
her
back
to
london
it
would
have
to
be
done
decently
of
course
but
it
would
have
he
thought
to
be
done
trafford
found
the
prospect
perfect
never
before
had
he
sounded
and
looked
so
like
that
dim
figure
which
hung
still
and
sympathetic
above
them
ever
and
again
she
glanced
up
at
her
husband
quiet
face
on
one
point
she
was
very
clear
with
him
you
live
with
us
mother
he
said
abruptly
not
with
you
as
near
as
you
like
but
one
house
one
woman
have
a
little
flat
of
my
own
for
you
both
to
come
to
me
oh
nonsense
mother
you
have
to
be
with
us
living
alone
indeed
my
dear
i
a
flat
of
my
own
you
understand
everything
it
will
be
better
for
all
of
us
like
that
there
came
a
little
pause
between
them
and
then
her
hand
was
on
his
head
again
oh
my
dear
she
said
i
want
you
to
be
happy
and
life
can
be
difficult
i
wo
give
a
chance
for
things
to
go
wrong
hers
dear
and
you
got
to
be
hers
be
each
other
altogether
watched
so
many
people
and
that
the
best
the
very
best
you
can
have
there
just
the
lovers
the
real
enduring
lovers
and
the
uncompleted
people
who
failed
to
find
trafford
second
meeting
with
marjorie
which
by
the
by
happened
on
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
brought
them
near
to
conclusive
decisions
the
stiffness
of
their
first
encounter
in
london
had
altogether
vanished
she
was
at
her
prettiest
and
in
the
highest
spirits
and
she
did
care
for
anything
else
in
the
world
a
gauzy
silk
scarf
which
she
had
bought
and
not
paid
for
that
day
floated
atmospherically
about
her
straight
trim
body
her
hair
had
caught
the
infection
of
insurrection
and
was
waving
rebelliously
about
her
ears
as
he
drew
near
her
his
grave
discretion
passed
from
him
as
clouds
pass
from
a
hillside
she
smiled
radiantly
he
held
out
both
his
hands
for
both
of
hers
and
never
did
a
maiden
come
so
near
and
yet
not
get
a
public
and
shameless
kissing
one
could
as
soon
describe
music
as
tell
their
conversation
it
was
a
matter
of
tones
and
feelings
but
the
idea
of
flight
together
of
the
bright
awakening
in
unfamiliar
sunshine
with
none
to
come
between
them
had
gripped
them
both
a
certain
sober
gravity
of
discussion
only
masked
that
deeper
inebriety
it
would
be
easy
for
them
to
get
away
he
had
no
lectures
until
february
he
could
he
said
make
arrangements
leave
his
research
she
dreaded
disputation
she
was
for
a
simple
disappearance
notes
on
pincushions
and
defiantly
apologetic
letters
from
boulogne
but
his
mother
atmosphere
had
been
a
gentler
one
than
her
home
with
a
more
powerful
disposition
to
dignity
he
still
could
understand
that
the
cantankerous
egotism
of
pope
was
indeed
the
essential
man
it
seemed
to
him
a
crust
of
bad
manners
that
reason
ought
to
pierce
the
difference
in
their
atmospheres
came
out
in
their
talk
in
his
desire
for
a
handsome
and
dignified
wedding
though
the
very
heavens
protested
and
her
resolve
to
cut
clear
of
every
one
to
achieve
a
sort
of
gaol
delivery
of
her
life
make
a
new
beginning
altogether
with
the
minimum
of
friction
and
the
maximum
of
surprise
unused
to
fighting
he
was
magnificently
prepared
to
fight
she
with
her
intimate
knowledge
of
chronic
domestic
conflict
was
for
the
evasion
of
all
the
bickerings
scoldings
and
misrepresentations
his
challenge
would
occasion
he
thought
in
his
innocence
a
case
could
be
stated
and
discussed
but
no
family
discussion
she
had
ever
heard
had
even
touched
the
realities
of
the
issue
that
occasioned
it
i
do
like
this
underhand
preparation
he
said
nor
i
she
echoed
but
what
can
one
do
well
ought
i
to
go
to
your
father
and
give
him
a
chance
why
should
i
it
the
dignified
way
it
wo
be
dignified
for
father
said
marjorie
anyhow
but
what
right
has
he
to
object
he
is
going
to
discuss
his
rights
with
you
he
object
but
oh
because
he
started
that
way
he
hit
you
i
have
forgotten
it
well
if
he
goes
back
on
that
now
he
rather
die
than
go
back
on
it
you
see
he
ashamed
in
his
heart
it
would
be
like
confessing
himself
wrong
not
to
keep
it
up
that
you
the
sort
of
man
one
hits
he
just
hates
you
because
he
hit
you
i
have
been
his
daughter
for
years
for
nothing
i
thinking
of
us
said
trafford
i
do
see
we
ought
to
go
to
him
just
because
he
likely
to
be
unreasonable
my
dear
do
as
you
please
he
forbid
and
shout
and
hit
tables
until
things
break
suppose
he
locks
me
up
oh
habeas
corpus
and
my
strong
right
arm
he
much
more
likely
to
turn
you
not
if
he
thinks
the
other
will
annoy
you
more
i
have
to
bear
a
storm
not
for
long
he
bully
mother
till
she
cries
over
me
but
do
as
you
please
come
and
she
beg
me
do
as
you
please
perhaps
i
a
coward
far
rather
i
could
slip
away
trafford
thought
for
a
moment
i
far
rather
you
could
he
answered
in
a
voice
that
spoke
of
inflexible
determinations
they
turned
to
the
things
they
meant
to
do
she
whispered
her
face
was
alight
with
her
burning
expectation
of
beauty
of
love
of
the
new
heaven
and
the
new
earth
that
lay
before
them
the
intensity
of
that
desire
blazing
through
her
seemed
to
shame
his
dull
discretions
he
had
to
cling
to
his
resolution
lest
it
should
vanish
in
that
contagious
intoxication
you
understand
i
shall
come
to
your
father
he
said
as
they
drew
near
the
gate
where
it
seemed
discreet
for
them
to
part
it
will
make
it
harder
to
get
away
she
said
with
no
apparent
despondency
it
wo
stop
us
oh
do
as
you
please
she
seemed
to
dismiss
the
question
and
stood
with
him
in
a
state
of
glowing
gravity
she
would
see
him
again
for
hours
then
a
thought
came
into
her
head
a
point
of
great
practical
moment
oh
she
said
of
course
you
wo
tell
father
you
seen
me
she
met
his
eye
really
you
must
she
said
you
see
he
make
a
row
with
mother
for
not
having
watched
me
better
i
do
know
what
he
is
likely
to
do
it
is
myself
this
is
a
confidential
communication
all
this
no
one
in
this
world
knows
i
am
meeting
you
if
you
go
to
him
go
to
him
for
myself
she
nodded
with
her
open
eyes
on
his
eyes
that
looked
now
very
blue
and
very
grave
and
her
lips
a
little
apart
she
surprised
him
a
little
but
even
this
sudden
weakness
seemed
adorable
all
right
he
said
you
do
think
that
i
shirking
she
asked
a
little
too
eagerly
you
know
your
father
best
he
answered
i
tell
you
all
he
says
and
all
the
terror
of
him
here
afternoon
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
trafford
found
himself
thinking
over
marjorie
it
was
a
new
form
of
mental
exercise
which
was
destined
to
play
a
large
part
in
his
existence
for
many
subsequent
years
there
had
come
a
shadow
on
his
confidence
in
her
she
was
a
glorious
person
she
had
a
kind
of
fire
behind
her
and
in
her
shining
through
her
like
the
lights
in
a
but
he
wished
she
had
not
made
him
promise
to
conceal
their
meeting
and
their
close
from
her
father
why
did
she
do
that
it
would
spoil
his
case
with
her
father
and
it
could
forward
things
for
them
in
no
conceivable
way
and
from
that
in
some
manner
too
subtle
to
trace
he
found
his
mind
wandering
to
another
problem
which
was
destined
to
reappear
with
a
slowly
dwindling
importance
very
often
in
this
procedure
of
thinking
over
marjorie
in
the
small
hours
it
was
the
riddle
it
never
came
to
him
in
the
daytime
but
only
in
those
intercalary
and
detachedly
critical
periods
of
thought
why
exactly
had
she
engaged
herself
to
magnet
why
had
she
he
could
imagine
himself
in
marjorie
position
doing
anything
of
the
sort
marjorie
had
ways
of
her
own
she
was
different
well
anyhow
she
was
splendid
and
loving
and
full
of
courage
he
had
got
no
further
than
this
when
at
last
he
fell
asleep
trafford
little
attempt
to
regularise
his
position
was
as
creditable
to
him
as
it
was
inevitably
futile
he
sought
out
hartstone
square
in
the
morning
on
his
way
to
his
laboratory
and
he
found
it
one
of
a
great
row
of
stucco
houses
each
with
a
portico
and
a
window
on
the
ground
floor
and
each
with
a
railed
area
from
which
troglodytic
servants
peeped
collectively
the
terrace
might
claim
a
certain
ugly
dignity
of
restraint
there
was
none
of
your
queen
anne
nonsense
of
art
or
beauty
about
it
and
the
narrow
height
the
subterranean
kitchens
of
each
constituent
house
told
of
a
steep
relentless
staircase
and
the
days
before
the
pampering
of
the
lower
classes
began
the
houses
formed
a
square
as
if
the
british
square
so
famous
at
waterloo
for
its
dogged
resistance
to
all
the
forces
of
the
universe
had
immortalized
itself
in
buildings
and
they
stared
upon
a
severely
railed
garden
of
hardy
shrubs
and
gravel
to
which
the
tenants
had
the
inestimable
privilege
of
access
they
did
not
use
it
much
that
was
their
affair
but
at
any
rate
they
had
keys
and
a
nice
sense
of
rights
assured
and
at
least
it
kept
other
people
out
trafford
turned
out
of
a
busy
high
road
full
of
the
mixed
exhilarating
traffic
of
our
time
and
came
along
a
quiet
street
into
this
place
and
it
seemed
to
him
he
had
come
into
a
corner
of
defence
and
retreat
into
an
atmosphere
of
obstinate
and
unteachable
resistances
but
this
illusion
of
conservativism
in
its
last
ditch
was
dispelled
altogether
in
pope
portico
youth
flashed
out
of
these
solemnities
like
a
dart
shot
from
a
cave
trafford
was
raising
his
hand
to
the
solid
brass
knocker
when
abruptly
it
was
snatched
from
his
fingers
the
door
was
flung
open
and
a
small
boy
with
a
number
of
dirty
books
in
a
strap
flew
out
and
hit
him
with
projectile
violence
blow
said
the
young
gentleman
recoiling
and
trafford
recovering
said
hullo
theodore
lord
said
theodore
breathless
it
you
a
lark
your
never
mentioned
no
how
what
you
do
wish
i
could
stop
and
see
it
i
ten
minutes
late
atque
so
long
he
vanished
with
incredible
velocity
and
trafford
was
alone
in
possession
of
the
open
doorway
except
for
toupee
who
after
a
violent
outbreak
of
hostility
altered
his
mind
and
cringed
to
his
feet
in
abject
and
affectionate
propitiation
a
appeared
said
hello
and
vanished
and
then
he
had
an
instant
vision
of
pope
newspaper
in
hand
appearing
from
the
his
expression
of
surprise
changed
to
malevolence
and
he
darted
back
into
the
room
from
which
he
had
emerged
trafford
decided
to
take
the
advice
of
a
small
brass
plate
on
his
left
hand
and
ring
also
a
housemaid
came
out
of
the
bowels
of
the
earth
very
promptly
and
ushered
him
up
two
flights
of
stairs
into
what
was
manifestly
study
it
was
a
narrow
rather
dark
room
lit
by
two
windows
and
with
a
gas
fire
before
which
pope
walking
boots
were
warming
for
the
day
the
apartment
revealed
to
trafford
cursory
inspection
many
of
the
stigmata
of
an
englishman
of
active
intelligence
and
literary
tastes
there
in
the
bookcase
were
the
collected
works
of
scott
a
good
large
illustrated
shakespeare
in
numerous
volumes
and
a
complete
set
of
bound
from
the
beginning
a
pile
of
back
numbers
of
the
stood
on
a
cane
stool
in
a
corner
and
in
a
little
bookcase
handy
for
the
occupier
of
the
desk
were
whitaker
wisden
and
an
old
peerage
the
desk
bore
traces
of
recent
epistolary
activity
and
was
littered
with
the
printed
matter
of
aunt
movements
two
or
three
recent
issues
of
financial
review
of
were
also
visible
about
the
room
hung
steel
engravings
apparently
of
defunct
judges
or
at
any
rate
of
exceedingly
grim
individuals
and
over
the
mantel
were
trophies
of
athletic
prowess
a
bat
witnessing
that
pope
had
once
captained
the
second
eleven
at
harrogby
pope
entered
with
a
stern
expression
and
a
sentence
prepared
well
sir
he
said
with
a
note
of
ironical
affability
to
what
may
i
ascribe
this
intrusion
trafford
was
about
to
reply
when
pope
interrupted
will
you
be
seated
he
said
and
turned
his
desk
chair
about
for
himself
and
occupying
it
crossed
his
legs
and
pressed
the
finger
tips
of
his
two
hands
together
well
sir
he
said
trafford
remained
standing
astraddle
over
the
boots
before
the
gas
fire
look
here
sir
he
said
i
am
in
love
with
your
daughter
she
one
and
twenty
and
i
want
to
see
her
and
in
fact
he
found
it
hard
to
express
himself
he
could
think
only
of
a
phrase
that
sounded
ridiculous
i
want
in
fact
to
pay
my
addresses
to
her
well
sir
i
do
want
you
to
do
so
that
is
too
mild
i
object
strongly
very
strongly
my
daughter
has
been
engaged
to
a
very
distinguished
and
able
man
and
i
hope
very
shortly
to
hear
that
that
engagement
practically
it
is
still
going
on
i
do
want
you
to
intrude
upon
my
daughter
further
but
look
here
sir
there
a
certain
justice
i
mean
a
certain
reasonableness
pope
held
out
an
arresting
hand
i
do
wish
it
let
that
be
enough
of
course
it
is
enough
i
in
love
with
her
and
she
with
me
an
entirely
reputable
and
decent
person
may
i
be
allowed
to
judge
what
is
or
is
not
suitable
companionship
for
my
daughter
and
what
may
or
may
not
be
the
present
state
of
her
affections
well
that
rather
the
point
we
are
discussing
after
all
marjorie
is
a
baby
i
want
to
do
all
this
this
affair
openly
and
properly
if
i
can
but
you
know
i
mean
to
marry
marjorie
anyhow
there
are
two
people
to
consult
in
that
matter
i
take
the
risk
of
that
permit
me
to
differ
a
feeling
of
helplessness
came
over
trafford
the
curious
irritation
pope
always
roused
in
him
began
to
get
the
better
of
him
his
face
flushed
hotly
oh
really
really
this
is
this
is
nonsense
he
cried
i
never
heard
anything
so
childish
and
pointless
as
your
objection
be
careful
sir
cried
pope
be
careful
i
going
to
marry
marjorie
if
she
marries
you
sir
she
shall
never
darken
my
doors
again
if
you
had
a
thing
against
me
i
what
have
you
there
was
a
quite
perceptible
pause
before
pope
fired
his
shot
does
any
decent
man
want
the
name
of
trafford
associated
with
his
daughter
trafford
look
at
the
hoardings
sir
a
sudden
blaze
of
anger
lit
trafford
my
god
he
cried
and
clenched
his
fists
and
seemed
for
a
moment
ready
to
fall
upon
the
man
before
him
then
he
controlled
himself
by
a
violent
effort
you
believe
in
that
libel
on
my
dead
father
he
said
with
white
lips
has
it
ever
been
answered
a
hundred
times
and
anyhow
confound
it
i
do
believe
believe
it
you
raked
it
up
as
an
excuse
you
want
an
excuse
for
your
infernal
domestic
tyranny
that
the
truth
of
it
you
ca
bear
a
creature
in
your
household
to
have
a
will
or
preference
of
her
own
i
tell
you
sir
you
are
intolerable
intolerable
he
was
shouting
and
pope
was
standing
now
and
shouting
too
leave
my
house
sir
get
out
of
my
house
sir
you
come
here
to
insult
me
sir
a
sudden
horror
of
himself
and
pope
seized
the
younger
man
he
stiffened
and
became
silent
never
in
his
life
before
had
he
been
in
a
bawling
quarrel
he
was
amazed
and
ashamed
leave
my
house
cried
pope
with
an
imperious
gesture
towards
the
door
trafford
made
an
absurd
effort
to
save
the
situation
i
am
sorry
sir
i
lost
my
temper
i
had
no
business
to
abuse
you
you
said
enough
i
apologise
for
that
i
done
what
i
could
to
manage
things
decently
will
you
go
sir
threatened
pope
i
sorry
i
came
said
trafford
pope
took
his
stand
with
folded
arms
and
an
expression
of
weary
patience
i
did
what
i
could
said
trafford
at
the
door
the
staircase
and
passage
were
deserted
the
whole
house
seemed
to
have
caught
from
pope
that
same
quality
of
seeing
him
out
confound
it
said
trafford
in
the
street
how
on
earth
did
all
this
happen
he
turned
eastward
and
then
realized
that
work
would
be
impossible
that
day
he
changed
his
direction
for
kensington
gardens
and
in
the
walk
near
the
albert
memorial
he
sat
down
on
a
chair
and
lugged
at
his
moustache
and
wondered
he
was
extraordinarily
perplexed
as
well
as
ashamed
and
enraged
by
this
uproar
how
had
it
begun
of
course
he
had
been
stupidly
abusive
but
the
insult
to
his
father
had
been
unendurable
did
a
man
of
pope
sort
quite
honestly
believe
that
stuff
if
he
did
he
deserved
kicking
if
he
did
of
course
he
was
entitled
to
have
it
cleared
up
but
then
he
listen
was
there
any
case
for
the
man
at
all
had
he
trafford
really
put
the
thing
so
that
pope
would
listen
he
could
remember
what
was
it
he
had
said
in
reply
to
pope
what
was
it
exactly
that
pope
had
said
it
was
already
vague
it
was
a
confused
memory
of
headlong
words
and
answers
what
was
vague
what
rang
in
his
ears
still
was
the
hoarse
discord
of
two
shouting
voices
could
marjorie
have
heard
so
marjorie
carried
her
point
she
was
to
be
married
tamely
after
the
common
fashion
which
trails
home
and
all
one
beginnings
into
the
new
life
she
was
to
be
eloped
with
romantically
and
splendidly
into
a
glorious
new
world
she
walked
on
shining
clouds
and
if
she
felt
some
remorse
it
was
a
very
tender
and
satisfactory
remorse
and
with
a
clear
conviction
below
it
that
in
the
end
she
would
be
forgiven
they
made
all
their
arrangements
elaborately
and
carefully
trafford
got
a
license
to
marry
her
she
was
to
have
a
new
outfit
from
top
to
toe
to
go
away
with
on
that
eventful
day
it
accumulated
in
the
shop
and
they
marked
the
clothes
she
was
watched
she
imagined
but
as
her
father
did
not
know
she
had
seen
trafford
nothing
had
been
said
to
her
and
no
attempt
was
made
to
prohibit
her
going
out
and
coming
in
trafford
entered
into
the
conspiracy
with
a
keen
interest
a
certain
amusement
and
a
queer
little
feeling
of
distaste
he
hated
to
hide
any
act
of
his
from
any
human
being
the
very
soul
of
scientific
work
you
see
is
publication
but
marjorie
seemed
to
justify
all
things
and
when
his
soul
turned
against
furtiveness
he
reminded
it
that
the
alternative
was
bawling
one
eventful
afternoon
he
went
to
the
college
and
marjorie
slipped
round
by
his
arrangement
to
have
tea
with
trafford
he
returned
about
seven
in
a
state
of
nervous
apprehension
came
upstairs
two
steps
at
a
time
and
stopped
breathless
on
the
landing
he
gulped
as
he
came
in
and
his
eyes
were
painfully
eager
she
been
he
asked
but
marjorie
had
won
trafford
she
been
she
answered
yes
she
all
right
my
dear
oh
mother
he
said
she
a
beautiful
creature
dear
and
such
a
child
oh
such
a
child
and
god
bless
you
dear
god
bless
you
i
think
all
young
people
are
children
i
want
to
take
you
both
in
my
arms
and
save
you
i
talking
nonsense
dear
he
kissed
her
and
she
clung
to
him
as
if
he
were
something
too
precious
to
release
the
elopement
was
a
little
complicated
by
a
surprise
manoeuvre
of
pope
she
was
more
alive
to
the
quality
of
the
situation
poor
lady
than
her
daughter
suspected
she
was
watching
dreading
perhaps
even
furtively
sympathizing
and
trying
to
arrange
oh
trying
dreadfully
to
arrange
she
had
an
instinctive
understanding
of
the
deep
blue
quiet
in
marjorie
eyes
and
the
girl
unusual
tenderness
with
daffy
and
the
children
she
peeped
under
the
blind
as
marjorie
went
out
noted
the
care
in
her
dress
watched
her
face
as
she
returned
never
plumbed
her
with
a
question
for
fear
of
the
answer
she
did
not
dare
to
breathe
a
hint
of
her
suspicions
to
her
husband
but
she
felt
things
were
adrift
in
swift
smooth
water
and
all
her
soul
cried
out
for
delay
so
presently
there
came
a
letter
from
cousin
susan
pendexter
at
plymouth
the
weather
was
beautiful
marjorie
must
come
at
once
pack
up
and
come
and
snatch
the
last
best
glow
of
the
dying
autumn
away
there
in
the
west
marjorie
excuses
her
manifest
chagrin
and
reluctance
confirmed
her
mother
worst
suspicions
she
submitted
and
went
and
pope
and
syd
saw
her
off
i
do
not
like
to
tell
how
a
week
later
marjorie
explained
herself
and
her
and
a
few
small
articles
back
to
london
from
plymouth
suffice
it
that
she
lied
desperately
and
elaborately
her
mother
had
never
achieved
such
miracles
of
and
she
added
a
vigour
that
was
all
her
own
it
is
easier
to
sympathize
with
her
than
exonerate
her
she
was
in
a
state
of
intense
impatience
and
what
is
strange
extraordinarily
afraid
that
something
would
separate
her
from
her
lover
if
she
did
not
secure
him
she
was
in
a
fever
of
determination
she
could
not
eat
or
sleep
or
attend
to
anything
whatever
she
was
occupied
altogether
with
the
thought
of
assuring
herself
to
trafford
he
towered
in
her
waking
vision
over
town
and
land
and
sea
he
did
hear
the
lies
she
told
he
only
knew
she
was
magnificently
coming
back
to
him
he
met
her
at
paddington
a
tired
splendidly
resolute
girl
and
they
went
to
the
waiting
forthwith
she
bore
herself
with
the
intentness
and
dignity
of
one
who
is
taking
the
cardinal
step
in
life
they
kissed
as
though
it
was
a
symbol
and
were
keenly
about
cabs
and
luggage
and
trains
at
last
they
were
alone
in
the
train
together
they
stared
at
one
another
we
done
it
mrs
trafford
said
trafford
she
snapped
like
an
string
crumpled
clung
to
him
and
without
a
word
was
weeping
passionately
in
his
arms
it
surprised
him
that
she
could
weep
as
she
did
and
still
more
to
see
her
as
she
walked
by
his
side
along
the
folkestone
pier
altogether
recovered
erect
a
little
flushed
and
excited
like
a
child
she
seemed
to
miss
nothing
oh
smell
the
sea
she
said
look
at
the
lights
listen
to
the
swish
of
the
water
below
she
watched
the
luggage
spinning
on
the
wire
rope
of
the
giant
crane
and
he
watched
her
face
and
thought
how
beautiful
she
was
he
wondered
why
her
eyes
could
sometimes
be
so
blue
and
sometimes
dark
as
night
the
boat
cleared
the
pier
and
turned
about
and
headed
for
france
they
walked
the
upper
deck
together
and
stood
side
by
side
she
very
close
to
him
i
never
crossed
the
sea
before
she
said
old
england
she
whispered
it
like
leaving
a
nest
a
little
row
of
lights
and
that
all
the
world
i
ever
known
shrunken
to
that
already
presently
they
went
forward
and
peered
into
the
night
look
she
said
there
sunshine
and
all
sorts
of
beautiful
things
ahead
warm
sunshine
wonderful
old
ruins
green
lizards
she
paused
and
whispered
almost
noiselessly
they
pressed
against
each
other
and
yet
is
it
strange
all
you
can
see
is
darkness
and
clouds
and
big
waves
that
hiss
as
they
come
near
italy
gave
all
her
best
to
welcome
them
it
was
a
late
year
a
golden
autumn
with
skies
of
such
blue
as
marjorie
had
never
seen
before
they
stayed
at
first
in
a
pretty
little
italian
hotel
with
a
garden
on
the
lake
and
later
they
walked
over
salvator
to
morcote
and
by
boat
to
ponte
tresa
and
thence
they
had
the
most
wonderful
and
beautiful
tramp
in
the
world
to
luino
over
the
hills
by
castelrotto
to
the
left
of
them
all
day
was
a
broad
valley
with
villages
swimming
in
a
luminous
mist
to
the
right
were
purple
mountains
they
passed
through
paved
streets
with
houses
the
colour
of
flesh
and
ivory
with
balconies
hung
with
corn
and
gourds
with
tall
church
campaniles
rising
high
and
great
archways
giving
upon
the
blue
lowlands
they
tramped
along
avenues
of
sweet
chestnut
and
between
stretches
of
exuberant
vineyard
in
which
men
and
women
were
gathering
grapes
purple
grapes
a
hatful
for
a
soldo
that
rasped
the
tongue
everything
was
strange
and
wonderful
to
marjorie
eyes
now
it
would
be
a
wayside
shrine
and
now
a
yoke
of
dewlapped
oxen
now
a
chapel
hung
about
with
and
now
some
unfamiliar
cultivation
or
a
child
or
a
scorpion
that
scuttled
in
the
dust
the
very
names
of
the
villages
were
like
jewels
to
her
varasca
croglio
ronca
sesia
monteggio
they
walked
or
sat
by
the
wayside
and
talked
or
rested
at
the
friendly
table
of
some
kindly
albergo
a
woman
as
beautiful
as
ceres
with
a
white
neck
all
open
made
them
an
omelette
and
then
fetched
her
baby
from
its
cradle
to
nurse
it
while
she
talked
to
them
as
they
made
their
meal
and
afterwards
she
filled
their
pockets
with
roasted
chestnuts
and
sent
them
with
melodious
good
wishes
upon
their
way
and
always
high
over
all
against
the
translucent
blue
hung
the
white
shape
of
monte
rosa
that
warmed
in
colour
as
the
evening
came
marjorie
head
was
swimming
with
happiness
and
beauty
and
with
every
fresh
delight
she
recurred
again
to
the
crowning
marvel
of
this
man
beside
her
who
smiled
and
carried
all
her
luggage
in
a
huge
rucksack
that
did
not
seem
to
exist
for
him
and
watched
her
and
caressed
her
and
was
hers
at
baveno
there
were
letters
they
sat
at
a
little
table
outside
a
café
and
read
them
suddenly
mindful
of
england
again
incipient
forgiveness
showed
through
pope
reproaches
and
there
was
also
a
simple
tender
there
is
no
other
word
for
it
from
old
trafford
to
her
son
from
baveno
they
set
off
up
monte
mottarone
whence
one
may
see
the
alps
from
visto
to
ortler
spitz
trusting
to
find
the
inn
still
open
and
if
it
was
closed
to
get
down
to
orta
somehow
before
night
or
at
the
worst
sleep
upon
the
mountain
side
monte
mottarone
just
for
a
moment
taste
the
sweet
italian
name
upon
your
lips
these
were
the
days
before
the
funicular
from
stresa
when
one
trudged
up
a
rude
path
through
the
chestnuts
and
walnuts
as
they
ascended
the
long
windings
through
the
woods
they
met
an
old
poet
and
his
wife
coming
down
from
sunset
and
sunrise
there
was
a
word
or
two
about
the
inn
and
they
went
upon
their
way
the
old
man
turned
ever
and
again
to
look
at
them
adorable
young
people
he
said
adorable
happy
young
people
did
you
notice
dear
how
she
held
that
dainty
little
chin
of
hers
pride
is
such
a
good
thing
my
dear
clear
straight
pride
like
theirs
and
they
were
both
so
proud
is
it
good
dear
to
think
that
once
you
and
i
may
have
looked
like
that
to
some
i
wish
i
could
bless
them
sweet
swift
young
things
i
wish
dear
it
was
possible
for
old
men
to
bless
young
people
without
seeming
to
set
up
for
saints
book
the
second
marjorie
married
chapter
the
first
settling
down
it
was
in
a
boat
among
reeds
upon
the
lake
of
orta
that
trafford
first
became
familiarized
with
the
idea
that
marjorie
was
capable
of
debt
oh
i
ought
to
have
told
you
she
began
apropos
of
nothing
her
explanation
was
airy
she
had
let
the
thing
slip
out
of
her
mind
for
a
time
but
there
were
various
debts
to
oxbridge
tradespeople
how
much
well
rather
a
lot
of
course
the
tradespeople
were
rather
enticing
when
first
one
went
up
how
much
anyhow
oh
about
fifty
pounds
said
marjorie
after
her
manner
not
i
not
kept
all
the
bills
and
some
have
come
in
you
know
how
slow
they
are
these
things
happen
said
trafford
though
as
a
matter
of
fact
nothing
of
the
sort
had
happened
in
his
case
however
you
be
able
to
pay
as
soon
as
you
get
home
and
get
them
all
off
your
mind
i
think
fifty
pounds
will
clear
me
said
marjorie
clinging
to
her
total
if
you
let
me
have
that
oh
we
do
do
things
like
that
said
trafford
i
arranging
that
my
current
account
will
be
a
sort
of
joint
account
and
your
signature
will
be
as
good
as
mine
for
the
purpose
of
drawing
at
least
have
your
own
i
do
understand
quite
said
marjorie
you
have
your
own
and
write
cheques
as
you
want
them
that
seems
the
simplest
way
to
me
of
course
said
marjorie
but
is
this
rather
unusual
father
always
used
to
allowance
mother
it
the
only
decent
way
according
to
my
ideas
said
trafford
a
man
should
marry
when
he
ca
trust
of
course
not
said
marjorie
something
between
fear
and
compunction
wrung
her
do
you
think
you
better
she
asked
very
earnestly
better
do
this
why
not
it
it
so
generous
he
did
answer
he
took
up
an
oar
and
began
to
push
out
from
among
the
reeds
with
something
of
the
shy
awkwardness
of
a
boy
who
becomes
apprehensive
of
thanks
he
stole
a
glance
at
her
presently
and
caught
her
expression
there
was
something
very
solemn
and
intent
in
her
eyes
and
he
thought
what
a
grave
fine
thing
his
marjorie
could
be
but
indeed
her
state
of
mind
was
quite
exceptionally
confused
she
was
disconcerted
and
horribly
afraid
of
herself
do
you
mean
that
i
can
spend
what
i
like
asked
marjorie
just
as
i
may
he
said
i
wonder
said
marjorie
again
if
i
better
she
was
tingling
with
delight
at
this
freedom
and
she
knew
she
was
not
fit
for
its
responsibility
she
just
came
short
of
a
passionate
refusal
of
his
proposal
he
was
still
so
new
to
her
and
things
were
so
wonderful
or
i
think
she
would
have
made
that
refusal
you
got
to
said
trafford
and
ended
the
matter
so
marjorie
was
silent
making
good
resolutions
perhaps
some
day
it
may
be
possible
to
tell
in
english
again
in
the
language
of
shakspeare
and
herrick
of
the
passion
the
tenderness
the
beauty
and
the
delightful
familiarizations
of
a
happy
honeymoon
suffice
it
now
in
this
delicate
period
to
record
only
how
our
two
young
lovers
found
one
day
that
neither
had
a
name
for
the
other
he
said
she
could
be
nothing
better
than
marjorie
to
him
and
she
after
a
number
of
unsuccessful
experiments
settled
down
to
the
old
nickname
made
out
of
his
initials
dick
she
said
is
too
and
andrew
i
ca
abide
goodwin
gives
one
no
chances
for
current
use
rag
you
must
be
mag
and
rag
poor
innocents
old
rag
mag
he
said
has
its
drawbacks
the
in
london
says
your
mag
no
i
think
i
shall
stick
to
marjorie
all
honeymoons
must
end
at
last
so
back
they
came
to
london
still
very
bright
and
happy
and
then
marjorie
whose
eyes
had
changed
from
flashing
stones
to
darkly
shining
pools
of
blue
but
whose
soul
had
still
perhaps
to
finds
its
depths
set
herself
to
the
business
of
decorating
and
furnishing
the
little
house
trafford
had
found
for
them
within
ten
minutes
of
her
own
meanwhile
they
lived
in
lodgings
there
can
be
no
denying
that
marjorie
began
her
furnishing
with
severely
virtuous
intentions
she
was
very
particular
to
ask
trafford
several
times
what
he
thought
she
might
spend
upon
the
enterprise
he
had
already
a
bedroom
and
a
study
equipped
and
he
threw
out
three
hundred
pounds
as
his
conception
of
an
acceptable
figure
very
well
said
marjorie
with
a
note
of
great
precision
now
i
shall
know
and
straightway
that
sum
took
a
place
in
her
imagination
that
was
at
once
definitive
and
protective
just
as
her
estimate
of
fifty
pounds
for
her
oxbridge
debts
had
always
been
she
assured
herself
she
was
going
to
do
things
and
she
assured
herself
she
was
doing
things
on
three
hundred
pounds
at
times
the
astonishment
of
two
or
three
school
friends
who
joined
her
in
her
shopping
stirred
her
to
a
momentary
surprise
at
the
way
she
was
managing
to
keep
things
within
that
limit
and
following
a
financial
method
that
had
after
all
in
spite
of
some
momentary
and
already
nearly
forgotten
distresses
worked
very
well
at
oxbridge
she
refrained
from
any
additions
until
all
the
accounts
had
come
to
hand
it
was
an
immense
excitement
shopping
to
make
a
home
there
was
in
her
composition
a
strain
of
constructive
artistry
with
such
concrete
things
a
strain
that
had
hitherto
famished
she
was
making
a
beautiful
secure
little
home
for
trafford
for
herself
for
possibilities
remote
perhaps
but
already
touching
her
imagination
with
the
anticipation
of
warm
new
wonderful
delights
there
should
be
simplicity
indeed
in
this
home
but
no
bareness
no
harshness
never
an
ugliness
nor
a
discord
she
had
always
loved
colour
in
the
skies
in
the
landscapes
in
the
texture
of
stuffs
and
garments
now
out
of
the
chaotic
skein
of
countless
shops
she
could
choose
and
pick
and
mingle
her
threads
in
a
glow
of
feminine
on
three
hundred
pounds
that
is
to
say
as
a
maximum
the
house
she
had
to
deal
with
was
like
trafford
old
and
rather
small
it
was
partly
to
its
lack
of
bedroom
accommodation
but
much
more
to
the
invasion
of
the
street
by
the
back
premises
of
siddons
thrale
the
great
chelsea
outfitters
that
the
lowness
of
the
rent
was
due
a
lowness
which
brought
it
within
the
means
of
trafford
marjorie
knew
very
clearly
that
her
father
would
say
her
husband
had
taken
her
to
live
in
a
noisy
slum
and
that
made
her
all
the
keener
to
ensure
that
every
good
point
in
the
interior
told
to
its
utmost
and
that
whatever
was
to
be
accessible
to
her
family
should
glow
with
a
refined
but
warm
prosperity
the
room
downstairs
was
shapely
and
by
ripping
off
the
papered
canvas
of
the
previous
occupier
some
very
dilapidated
but
admirably
proportioned
panelling
was
brought
to
light
the
and
study
door
on
the
ground
floor
by
a
happy
accident
were
of
mahogany
with
really
very
beautiful
brass
furnishings
and
the
window
upon
the
minute
but
by
no
means
offensive
paved
garden
behind
was
curved
and
had
a
little
shallow
balcony
of
ironwork
half
covered
by
a
devitalized
but
leafy
grapevine
moreover
the
previous
occupier
had
equipped
the
place
with
electric
light
and
a
bathroom
of
almost
american
splendour
on
the
landing
and
white
painted
so
that
it
was
a
delight
to
go
into
marjorie
mind
leapt
very
rapidly
to
the
possibilities
of
this
little
establishment
the
panelling
must
be
done
and
done
well
anyhow
that
would
be
no
more
than
a
wise
economy
seeing
it
might
at
any
time
help
them
to
it
would
be
painted
white
of
course
and
thus
set
the
key
for
a
clean
brightness
of
colour
throughout
the
furniture
would
stand
out
against
the
softly
shining
white
and
its
line
and
proportions
must
be
therefore
the
primary
qualities
to
consider
as
she
bought
it
the
study
was
much
narrower
than
the
and
so
the
passage
which
the
agent
called
the
hall
was
much
broader
and
more
commodious
behind
the
happily
wide
staircase
than
in
front
and
she
was
able
to
banish
out
of
the
sight
of
the
chance
visitor
all
that
litter
of
and
letters
boxes
arriving
and
parcels
to
post
which
had
always
offended
her
eye
at
home
at
home
there
had
been
often
the
most
unsightly
things
visible
one
of
theo
awful
caps
or
his
school
books
and
not
infrequently
her
father
and
all
too
fatally
comfortable
house
slippers
a
good
effect
at
first
is
half
the
victory
of
a
well
done
house
and
marjorie
accomplished
another
of
her
real
economies
here
by
carpeting
hall
and
staircase
with
a
and
rather
blue
carpet
held
down
by
very
thick
brass
she
hung
up
four
steel
engravings
put
a
single
chippendale
chair
in
the
hall
and
a
dark
old
dutch
clock
that
had
turned
out
to
be
only
five
pounds
when
she
had
expected
the
shopman
to
say
eleven
or
twelve
on
the
that
was
all
round
the
corner
by
the
study
door
was
a
mahogany
slab
and
the
litter
all
went
upon
a
capacious
but
very
simple
and
table
that
were
out
of
the
picture
entirely
until
you
reached
the
stairs
her
was
difficult
for
some
time
she
had
equipped
that
with
a
dark
oak
welsh
dresser
made
very
bright
with
a
dessert
service
that
was
in
view
of
its
extremely
decorative
quality
remarkably
cheap
and
with
some
very
pretty
glass
bottles
and
flasks
this
dresser
and
a
number
of
simple
but
shapely
facsimiles
of
old
chairs
stood
out
against
a
nearly
primrose
paper
very
faintly
patterned
and
a
dark
blue
carpet
with
a
margin
of
dead
wood
over
the
mantel
was
a
german
of
waves
full
of
sunlight
breaking
under
cliffs
and
between
this
and
the
window
were
dark
bookshelves
and
a
few
books
on
the
wall
were
four
very
good
japanese
prints
rich
in
and
that
answered
the
floor
and
the
window
curtains
took
up
some
of
the
colours
of
the
german
print
but
something
was
needed
towards
the
window
she
felt
to
balance
the
warmly
shining
plates
upon
the
dresser
the
deep
of
the
cherries
that
adorned
them
was
too
isolated
usurped
too
dominating
a
value
and
while
this
was
weighing
upon
her
mind
she
saw
in
a
window
in
regent
street
a
number
of
bokhara
hangings
very
nobly
displayed
they
were
splendid
pieces
of
needlework
particularly
glorious
in
their
crimsons
and
reds
and
suddenly
it
came
to
her
that
it
was
just
one
of
these
one
that
had
great
ruby
flowers
upon
it
with
interlacings
that
was
needed
to
weld
her
scheme
together
she
hesitated
went
to
piccadilly
circus
turned
back
and
asked
the
prices
the
prices
were
towering
prices
ten
fifteen
eighteen
guineas
and
when
at
last
the
shopman
produced
one
with
all
the
charm
of
colour
she
sought
at
eight
it
seemed
like
ten
guineas
snatched
back
as
they
dropped
from
her
hands
and
still
hesitating
she
had
three
that
pleased
her
most
sent
home
on
approval
before
she
decided
finally
to
purchase
one
of
them
but
the
trial
was
conclusive
and
then
struck
with
a
sudden
idea
she
carried
off
a
long
narrow
one
she
had
had
no
idea
of
buying
before
into
the
little
study
behind
suppose
she
thought
instead
of
hanging
two
curtains
as
anybody
else
would
do
in
that
window
she
ran
this
glory
of
rich
colour
across
from
one
side
on
a
great
rod
of
brass
she
was
giving
the
study
the
very
best
of
her
attention
after
she
had
lapsed
in
some
other
part
of
the
house
from
the
standards
of
rigid
economy
she
had
set
up
she
would
as
it
were
restore
the
balance
by
adding
something
to
the
gracefully
dignified
arrangement
of
this
den
he
was
to
use
and
the
brass
rod
of
the
bokhara
hanging
that
was
to
do
instead
of
curtains
released
her
mind
somehow
to
the
purchase
of
certain
old
candlesticks
she
had
hitherto
resisted
they
were
to
stand
bored
to
carry
candle
electric
lights
on
either
corner
of
the
low
bookcase
that
faced
the
window
they
were
very
heavy
very
shapely
candlesticks
and
they
cost
shillings
they
looked
remarkably
well
when
they
were
put
up
except
that
a
sort
of
hollowness
appeared
between
them
and
clamoured
for
a
delightful
old
workbox
she
had
seen
in
a
shop
in
baker
street
enquiry
confirmed
her
quick
impression
that
this
was
a
genuine
piece
of
quite
exceptional
genuineness
and
that
the
price
they
asked
five
pounds
ten
and
came
down
to
five
guineas
was
in
accordance
with
this
it
was
a
little
difficult
in
spite
of
the
silent
hunger
between
the
candlesticks
to
reconcile
this
particular
article
with
her
dominating
idea
of
an
austerely
restrained
expenditure
until
she
hit
upon
the
device
of
calling
it
a
and
regarding
it
not
as
furniture
but
as
a
present
from
herself
to
trafford
that
happened
to
fall
in
very
agreeably
with
the
process
of
house
furnishing
she
decided
she
would
some
day
economise
its
cost
out
of
her
dress
allowance
the
bookcase
on
which
it
stood
was
a
happy
discovery
in
kensington
just
five
feet
high
and
with
beautiful
oval
glass
fronts
and
its
capacity
was
supplemented
and
any
excess
in
its
price
at
least
morally
compensated
by
a
very
tall
narrow
set
of
open
shelves
that
had
been
made
for
some
special
corner
in
another
house
and
which
anyhow
were
really
and
truly
dirt
cheap
the
desk
combined
grace
and
good
proportions
to
an
admirable
extent
the
fender
of
pierced
brass
looked
as
if
it
had
always
lived
in
immediate
contact
with
the
shapely
old
white
marble
fireplace
and
the
two
were
marvels
of
dignified
comfort
by
the
fireplace
were
a
needlework
firescreen
a
white
sheepskin
hearthrug
a
little
patch
and
powder
table
adapted
to
carry
books
and
a
lamp
grouped
in
a
common
inaudible
demand
for
a
reader
in
slippers
trafford
when
at
last
the
apartment
was
ready
for
his
inspection
surveyed
these
arrangements
with
a
kind
of
dazzled
admiration
by
jove
he
said
how
little
people
know
of
the
homes
of
the
poor
marjorie
was
so
delighted
with
his
approval
that
she
determined
to
show
trafford
next
day
how
prettily
at
least
her
son
was
going
to
live
the
good
lady
came
and
admired
everything
and
particularly
the
bokhara
hangings
she
did
not
seem
to
appraise
but
something
set
marjorie
talking
rather
nervously
of
a
good
fortune
trafford
glanced
at
the
candlesticks
and
the
low
bookcase
and
returned
to
the
glowing
piece
of
needlework
that
formed
the
symmetrical
window
curtain
in
the
study
she
took
it
in
her
hand
and
whispered
beautiful
but
are
these
rather
good
asked
trafford
marjorie
answered
after
a
little
pause
they
not
too
good
for
she
said
and
now
these
young
people
had
to
resume
life
in
london
in
earnest
the
orchestral
accompaniment
of
the
world
at
large
began
to
mingle
with
their
hitherto
unsustained
duet
it
had
been
inaudible
in
italy
in
chelsea
it
had
sounded
faintly
perhaps
but
distinctly
from
their
very
first
inspection
of
the
little
house
a
speaks
of
callers
a
of
and
dinners
it
had
swayed
marjorie
from
the
front
door
inward
during
their
honeymoon
they
had
been
gloriously
unconscious
of
comment
now
marjorie
began
to
show
herself
keenly
sensitive
to
the
advent
of
a
score
of
personalities
and
very
anxious
to
show
just
how
completely
successful
in
every
sense
her
romantic
disobedience
had
been
she
knew
she
had
been
approved
of
admired
condemned
sneered
at
thoroughly
discussed
she
felt
it
her
first
duty
to
trafford
to
all
who
had
approved
of
her
flight
to
every
one
herself
included
to
make
this
marriage
obviously
indisputably
a
success
a
success
not
only
by
her
own
standards
but
by
the
standards
of
anyonesoever
who
chose
to
sit
in
judgment
on
her
there
was
trafford
she
felt
she
had
to
extort
the
admission
from
every
one
that
he
was
the
handsomest
finest
ablest
most
promising
and
most
delightful
man
a
prominent
humorist
was
ever
jilted
for
she
wanted
them
to
understand
clearly
just
all
that
trafford
was
and
that
involved
she
speedily
found
in
practice
making
them
believe
a
very
great
deal
that
as
yet
trafford
was
she
found
it
practically
impossible
not
to
anticipate
his
election
to
the
royal
society
and
the
probability
of
a
more
important
professorship
she
felt
that
anyhow
he
was
an
in
the
sight
of
god
it
was
almost
equally
difficult
not
to
indicate
a
larger
income
than
facts
justified
it
was
entirely
in
marjorie
vein
in
those
early
days
that
she
would
want
to
win
on
every
score
and
by
every
standard
of
reckoning
if
marjorie
had
been
a
general
she
would
have
counted
no
victory
complete
if
the
struggle
was
not
sustained
and
desperate
and
if
it
left
the
enemy
with
a
single
gun
or
flag
or
herself
with
so
much
as
a
man
killed
or
wounded
the
people
she
wanted
to
impress
varied
very
widely
she
wanted
to
impress
the
carmel
girls
and
the
carmel
girls
she
knew
with
their
racial
trick
of
acute
appraisement
were
only
to
be
won
by
the
very
highest
quality
all
round
they
had
she
knew
two
standards
of
quality
cost
and
distinction
as
far
as
possible
she
would
give
them
distinction
but
whenever
she
hesitated
over
something
on
the
verge
of
cheapness
the
thought
of
those
impending
judgments
tipped
the
balance
the
carmel
girls
were
just
two
influential
representatives
of
a
host
she
wanted
to
impress
quite
a
number
of
other
school
and
college
friends
there
were
various
shy
emotional
creatures
of
course
for
the
most
part
with
no
confidence
in
their
own
appearance
who
would
be
impressed
quite
adequately
enough
by
trafford
good
looks
and
witty
manner
and
easy
temper
they
might
perhaps
fall
in
love
with
him
and
become
slavish
to
her
after
the
way
of
their
kind
and
anyhow
they
would
be
provided
for
but
there
were
plenty
of
others
of
a
harder
texture
whose
tests
would
be
more
difficult
to
satisfy
there
were
girls
who
were
the
daughters
of
prominent
men
who
must
be
made
to
understand
that
trafford
was
prominent
girls
who
were
well
connected
who
must
be
made
to
realize
the
subtle
excellence
of
trafford
blood
as
she
thought
of
constance
graham
for
example
or
ottiline
winchelsea
she
felt
the
strongest
disposition
to
thicken
the
by
no
means
well
authenticated
strands
that
linked
trafford
with
the
traffords
of
she
went
about
the
house
dreaming
a
little
apprehensively
of
these
coming
calls
and
the
pitiless
light
of
criticism
they
would
bring
to
bear
not
indeed
upon
her
happiness
that
was
assured
but
upon
her
success
the
social
side
of
the
position
would
have
to
be
strained
to
the
utmost
marjorie
felt
with
aunt
plessington
the
thought
of
aunt
plessington
made
her
peculiarly
apprehensive
aunt
plessington
had
to
the
fullest
extent
that
contempt
for
merely
artistic
or
scientific
people
which
sits
so
gracefully
upon
the
administrative
english
you
see
people
of
that
sort
do
not
get
on
in
the
sense
that
a
young
lawyer
or
barrister
gets
on
they
do
not
make
steps
they
boast
and
quarrel
and
are
jealous
perhaps
but
that
steady
patient
shove
upward
seems
beyond
their
intelligence
the
energies
god
manifestly
gave
them
for
shoving
they
dissipate
in
the
creation
of
weak
beautiful
things
and
unremunerative
theories
or
in
the
establishment
of
views
sometimes
diametrically
opposed
to
the
ideas
of
influential
people
and
they
are
queer
socially
they
just
moon
about
doing
this
work
of
theirs
and
even
when
the
judgment
of
eccentric
people
forces
a
kind
of
reputation
upon
them
heaven
knows
why
they
make
no
public
or
social
use
of
it
it
seemed
to
aunt
plessington
that
the
artist
and
the
scientific
man
were
dealt
with
very
neatly
and
justly
in
the
parable
of
the
buried
talent
moreover
their
private
lives
were
often
scandalous
they
married
for
love
instead
of
interest
often
quite
disadvantageously
and
their
relationships
had
all
the
instability
that
is
natural
upon
such
a
foundation
and
after
all
what
good
were
they
she
had
never
met
an
artist
or
a
prominent
imaginative
writer
or
scientific
man
that
she
had
not
been
able
to
subdue
in
a
minute
or
so
by
flat
contradiction
and
if
necessary
slightly
raising
her
voice
they
had
little
or
no
influence
even
upon
their
own
public
appointments
the
thought
of
the
invasion
of
her
agreeable
little
back
street
establishment
by
this
britannic
system
of
judgments
filled
heart
with
secret
terrors
she
felt
she
had
to
grapple
with
and
overcome
aunt
plessington
or
be
for
ever
fallen
at
least
so
far
as
that
amiable
lady
report
went
and
she
knew
it
went
pretty
far
she
wandered
about
the
house
trying
to
imagine
herself
aunt
plessington
immediately
she
felt
the
gravest
doubts
whether
the
whole
thing
too
graceful
and
pretty
a
rich
and
rather
massive
ugliness
of
course
would
have
been
the
thing
to
fetch
aunt
plessington
happily
it
was
aunt
plessington
habit
to
veil
her
eyes
with
her
voice
she
might
not
see
very
much
the
subjugation
of
aunt
plessington
was
difficult
but
not
altogether
hopeless
marjorie
felt
provided
her
rejection
of
magnet
had
not
been
taken
as
an
act
of
personal
ingratitude
there
was
a
case
on
her
side
she
was
discovering
for
example
that
trafford
had
a
really
very
considerable
range
of
acquaintance
among
quite
distinguished
people
big
figures
like
evesham
and
machaldo
for
example
were
intelligently
interested
in
the
trend
of
his
work
she
felt
this
gave
her
a
basis
for
plessingtonian
justifications
she
could
produce
those
people
as
one
shows
one
loot
she
could
imply
oh
love
and
all
that
nonsense
certainly
not
is
what
i
did
it
for
with
skill
and
care
and
good
luck
and
a
word
here
and
there
in
edgeways
she
believed
she
might
be
able
to
represent
the
whole
adventure
as
the
opening
of
a
campaign
on
soundly
plessingtonian
lines
her
marriage
to
trafford
she
tried
to
persuade
herself
might
be
presented
as
something
almost
as
brilliant
and
startling
as
her
aunt
swoop
upon
her
undistinguished
uncle
she
might
pretend
that
all
along
she
had
seen
her
way
to
things
to
coveted
and
the
familiarity
of
coveted
guests
to
bringing
people
together
and
contriving
arrangements
to
influence
and
prominence
to
culminations
and
intrigues
impossible
in
the
comparatively
specialized
world
of
a
successful
humorist
and
playwright
and
so
at
last
to
those
high
freedoms
of
authoritative
and
if
necessary
offensive
utterance
in
a
strangulated
contralto
and
from
a
position
of
secure
eminence
which
is
the
goal
of
all
virtuously
ambitious
englishwomen
of
the
governing
classes
that
is
to
say
of
all
virtuously
ambitious
englishwomen
and
while
such
turbid
solicitudes
as
these
were
flowing
in
again
from
the
london
world
to
which
she
had
returned
and
fouling
the
bright
romantic
clearness
of
marjorie
life
trafford
in
his
ampler
less
detailed
way
was
also
troubled
about
their
coming
into
society
he
too
had
his
old
associations
for
example
he
was
by
no
means
confident
of
the
favourable
judgments
of
his
mother
upon
marjorie
circle
of
school
and
college
friends
whom
he
gathered
from
marjorie
talk
were
destined
to
play
a
large
part
in
this
new
phase
of
his
life
she
had
given
him
very
ample
particulars
of
some
of
them
and
he
found
them
interesting
rather
than
richly
attractive
personalities
it
is
to
be
noted
that
while
he
thought
always
of
marjorie
as
a
beautiful
woman
and
his
mate
and
equal
he
was
still
disposed
to
regard
her
intimate
friends
as
schoolgirls
of
an
advanced
and
aggressive
type
then
that
large
circle
of
distinguished
acquaintances
which
marjorie
saw
so
easily
and
amply
utilized
for
the
subjugation
of
aunt
plessington
did
present
itself
quite
in
that
service
to
trafford
private
thoughts
he
had
that
certitude
of
command
over
them
nor
that
confidence
in
their
unhesitating
approval
of
all
he
said
and
did
just
as
marjorie
wished
him
to
shine
in
the
heavens
over
all
her
people
so
in
regard
to
his
associates
he
was
extraordinarily
anxious
that
they
should
realize
and
realize
from
the
outset
without
qualification
or
hesitation
how
beautiful
brave
and
delightful
she
was
and
you
know
he
had
already
begun
to
be
aware
of
an
evasive
feeling
in
his
mind
that
at
times
she
did
not
altogether
do
herself
justice
he
scarcely
knew
as
yet
how
or
why
she
was
very
young
one
or
two
individuals
stood
out
in
his
imagination
representatives
and
symbols
of
the
rest
particularly
there
was
that
old
giant
sir
roderick
dover
who
had
been
until
recently
the
professor
of
physics
in
the
great
oxford
laboratories
dover
and
trafford
had
one
of
those
warm
friendships
which
spring
up
at
times
between
a
man
whose
greatness
is
assured
and
a
young
man
of
brilliant
promise
it
was
all
the
more
affectionate
because
dover
had
been
a
friend
of
father
these
two
and
a
group
of
other
able
distinguished
and
uninfluential
men
at
the
winton
club
affected
the
end
of
the
near
the
conservatory
in
the
hours
after
lunch
and
shared
the
joys
of
good
talk
and
fine
jesting
about
the
big
fireplace
there
under
dover
broad
influence
they
talked
more
ideas
and
less
gossip
than
is
usual
with
english
club
men
twaddle
about
appointments
about
reputations
topics
from
the
morning
papers
london
architecture
and
the
commerce
in
good
stories
took
refuge
at
the
other
end
in
the
window
bays
or
by
the
further
fireplace
trafford
only
began
to
realize
on
his
return
to
london
how
large
a
share
this
intermittent
perennial
conversation
had
contributed
to
the
atmosphere
of
his
existence
amidst
the
romantic
circumstances
of
his
flight
with
marjorie
he
had
forgotten
the
part
these
men
played
in
his
life
and
thoughts
now
he
was
enormously
exercised
in
the
search
for
a
reconciliation
between
these
he
felt
incommensurable
factors
he
was
afraid
of
what
might
be
sir
roderick
unspoken
judgment
on
marjorie
and
the
house
she
had
made
though
what
was
there
to
be
afraid
of
he
was
still
more
afraid
and
this
was
even
more
remarkable
of
the
clear
little
judgments
hard
as
loose
small
diamonds
in
a
bed
that
he
thought
marjorie
might
pronounce
on
sir
roderick
he
had
never
disguised
from
himself
that
sir
roderick
was
fat
nobody
who
came
within
a
hundred
yards
of
him
could
be
under
any
illusion
about
that
and
that
he
drank
a
good
deal
ate
with
a
cosmic
spaciousness
loved
a
cigar
and
talked
and
laughed
with
a
freedom
that
sometimes
drove
new
members
into
the
corners
remotest
from
the
historical
fireplace
trafford
knew
himself
quite
definitely
that
there
was
a
joy
in
dover
laugh
and
voice
a
beauty
in
his
face
that
was
somehow
mixed
up
with
his
healthy
corpulence
and
a
breadth
a
charity
a
leonine
courage
in
his
mind
that
was
somehow
mixed
up
with
his
careless
freedom
of
speech
that
made
him
an
altogether
satisfactory
person
but
supposing
marjorie
did
see
any
of
that
still
he
was
on
the
verge
of
bringing
sir
roderick
home
when
a
talk
at
the
club
one
day
postponed
that
introduction
of
the
two
extremes
of
trafford
existence
for
quite
a
considerable
time
those
were
the
days
of
the
first
enthusiasms
of
the
militant
suffrage
movement
and
the
occasional
smashing
of
a
downing
street
window
or
an
assault
upon
a
minister
kept
the
question
of
woman
distinctive
intelligence
and
character
persistently
before
the
public
godley
buzard
the
feminist
novelist
had
been
the
guest
of
some
member
to
lunch
and
the
occasion
was
too
provocative
for
any
one
about
fireplace
to
avoid
the
topic
buzard
presence
perhaps
drove
dover
into
an
extreme
position
on
the
other
side
he
forgot
condition
and
handled
this
great
argument
an
argument
which
has
scarcely
progressed
since
its
beginning
in
the
days
of
plato
and
aristophanes
with
the
freedoms
of
an
ancient
greek
and
the
explicitness
of
a
modern
scientific
man
he
opened
almost
apropos
of
nothing
women
he
said
are
inferior
and
you
ca
get
away
from
it
you
can
deny
it
said
buzard
in
the
face
of
the
facts
said
sir
roderick
to
begin
with
several
inches
shorter
several
pounds
lighter
they
less
physical
strength
in
footpounds
more
endurance
said
buzard
less
sensitiveness
merely
all
those
are
demonstrable
things
amenable
to
figures
and
apparatus
then
they
stand
nervous
tensions
worse
the
comes
sooner
they
have
weaker
inhibitions
and
inhibition
is
the
test
of
a
creature
position
in
the
mental
scale
he
maintained
that
in
the
face
of
buzard
animated
protest
buzard
glanced
at
their
moral
qualities
more
moral
cried
dover
more
not
a
bit
of
it
their
desires
and
passions
are
weaker
even
than
their
controls
that
all
weaken
restraints
and
they
show
their
quality
a
drunken
woman
is
far
worse
than
a
drunken
man
and
as
for
their
biological
significance
they
are
the
species
said
buzard
and
we
are
the
accidents
they
are
the
stolon
and
we
are
the
individualized
branches
they
are
the
stem
and
we
are
the
fruits
surely
it
better
to
exist
than
just
transmit
existence
and
that
a
woman
business
though
we
fooled
and
petted
most
of
into
forgetting
it
he
proceeded
to
an
attack
on
the
intellectual
quality
of
women
he
scoffed
at
the
woman
artist
at
feminine
research
at
what
he
called
the
joke
of
feminine
philosophy
buzard
broke
in
with
some
sentences
of
reply
he
alleged
the
lack
of
feminine
opportunity
inferior
education
you
do
or
wo
understand
me
said
dover
it
is
a
matter
of
education
or
opportunity
or
simply
that
they
of
inferior
capacity
it
lies
deeper
than
that
they
do
to
do
these
things
different
precisely
ejaculated
buzard
as
if
he
claimed
a
score
they
do
care
for
these
things
they
do
care
for
art
or
philosophy
or
literature
or
anything
except
the
things
that
touch
them
directly
that
their
peculiar
difference
hunger
they
understand
and
comfort
and
personal
vanity
and
desire
furs
and
chocolate
and
husbands
and
the
extreme
importance
conferred
upon
them
by
having
babies
at
infrequent
intervals
but
philosophy
or
beauty
for
its
own
sake
or
dreams
lord
no
the
mahometans
know
they
have
souls
and
they
say
it
we
know
and
keep
it
up
that
they
have
have
all
we
scientific
men
had
in
our
laboratories
working
do
we
know
the
papers
they
turn
out
every
sane
man
of
five
and
forty
knows
something
of
the
disillusionment
of
the
feminine
dream
but
we
who
had
the
beautiful
creatures
under
us
weighing
rather
badly
handling
rather
weakly
invariably
missing
every
fine
detail
and
all
the
implications
of
our
researches
never
flashing
never
leaping
never
being
even
thoroughly
bad
we
specialists
in
the
subject
at
the
present
time
there
are
far
more
educated
young
women
than
educated
young
men
available
for
research
work
and
who
wants
them
oh
the
young
professors
who
still
got
ideals
perhaps
and
in
they
come
and
if
they
dull
they
just
voluminously
do
nothing
and
if
they
bright
they
either
marry
your
demonstrator
or
get
him
into
a
mess
and
the
work
it
nothing
to
them
no
woman
ever
painted
for
the
love
of
painting
or
sang
for
the
sounds
she
made
or
philosophized
for
the
sake
of
wisdom
as
men
do
buzard
intervened
with
instances
dover
would
have
none
of
them
he
displayed
astonishing
and
distinctive
knowledge
madame
curie
clamoured
buzard
madame
curie
there
was
curie
said
dover
no
woman
alone
has
done
such
things
i
do
say
women
are
clever
he
insisted
they
too
clever
give
them
a
man
track
or
a
man
intention
marked
and
defined
they
ape
him
to
the
life
buzard
renewed
his
protests
talking
at
the
same
time
as
dover
and
was
understood
to
say
that
women
had
to
care
for
something
greater
than
art
or
philosophy
they
were
custodians
of
life
the
future
of
the
race
and
that
my
crowning
disappointment
cried
dover
if
there
was
one
thing
in
which
you
might
think
women
would
show
a
sense
of
some
divine
purpose
in
life
it
is
in
the
matter
of
children
and
they
show
about
as
much
care
in
that
matter
oh
as
rabbits
yes
rabbits
i
stick
to
it
look
at
the
things
a
nice
girl
will
marry
look
at
the
children
she
consent
to
bring
into
the
world
cheerfully
proudly
for
the
sake
of
the
home
and
the
clothes
nasty
little
beasts
breed
without
turning
a
hair
all
about
us
we
see
girls
and
women
marrying
ugly
men
dull
and
stupid
men
dyspeptic
wrecks
sickly
young
fools
human
rats
no
no
cried
trafford
to
dover
buzard
voice
clamoured
that
all
would
be
different
when
women
had
the
vote
if
ever
we
get
a
decent
care
for
eugenics
it
will
come
from
men
said
a
little
man
on
the
sofa
beside
trafford
in
the
confidential
tone
of
one
who
tells
a
secret
doing
it
cheerfully
insisted
dover
trafford
in
was
suddenly
stricken
into
silence
by
a
memory
it
was
as
if
the
past
had
thrown
a
stone
at
the
back
of
his
head
and
hit
it
smartly
he
nipped
his
sentence
in
the
bud
he
left
the
case
for
women
to
buzard
he
revived
that
memory
again
on
his
way
home
it
had
been
in
his
mind
overlaid
by
a
multitude
of
newer
fresher
things
but
now
he
took
it
out
and
looked
at
it
it
was
queer
it
was
really
very
queer
to
think
that
once
upon
a
time
not
so
very
long
ago
marjorie
had
been
prepared
to
marry
magnet
of
course
she
had
hated
it
but
still
there
is
much
to
be
discovered
about
life
even
by
a
brilliant
and
rising
young
professor
of
physics
presently
dover
fingering
the
little
glass
of
yellow
chartreuse
he
had
hitherto
forgotten
in
the
heat
of
controversy
took
a
more
personal
turn
do
we
know
he
said
and
made
the
limpid
amber
vanish
in
his
pause
do
we
know
we
got
to
manage
and
control
just
as
we
got
to
keep
and
stand
the
racket
of
their
misbehaviour
do
our
instincts
tell
us
does
something
tell
us
all
that
if
we
let
a
woman
loose
with
our
honour
and
trust
some
other
man
will
get
hold
of
her
we
tried
it
long
enough
now
this
theory
that
a
woman
a
partner
and
an
equal
we
tried
it
long
enough
to
see
some
of
the
results
and
does
it
work
does
it
a
woman
a
prize
a
possession
a
responsibility
something
to
take
care
of
and
be
careful
about
you
chaps
if
you
forgive
me
you
advanced
chaps
seem
to
want
to
have
the
women
take
care
of
you
you
seem
always
to
want
to
force
decisions
on
them
make
them
answerable
for
things
that
you
ought
to
decide
and
answer
for
if
one
could
if
one
could
if
but
they
not
helps
that
a
dream
distractions
gratifications
anxieties
dangers
undertakings
buzard
got
in
his
one
effective
blow
at
this
point
that
why
never
married
sir
roderick
he
threw
out
the
big
man
was
checked
for
a
moment
trafford
wondered
what
memory
lit
that
instant
pause
i
had
my
science
said
dover
pope
was
of
course
among
the
first
to
visit
the
new
home
so
soon
as
it
was
open
to
inspection
she
arrived
looking
very
bright
and
neat
in
a
new
bonnet
and
some
new
black
furs
that
suited
her
bearing
up
bravely
but
obviously
in
a
state
of
dispersed
and
miscellaneous
emotion
in
many
ways
marjorie
marriage
had
been
a
great
relief
to
her
mother
particularly
it
had
been
a
financial
relief
marjorie
had
been
the
most
expensive
child
of
her
family
and
her
cessation
had
led
to
increments
both
of
pope
and
daphne
all
too
restricted
allowances
pope
had
been
able
therefore
to
relapse
from
the
orthodox
anglicanism
into
which
poverty
had
driven
her
and
indulge
for
an
hour
weekly
in
the
consolations
of
higher
thought
these
exercises
in
emancipated
religiosity
occurred
at
the
house
of
silas
root
and
were
greatly
valued
by
a
large
circle
of
clients
essentially
they
were
orgies
of
vacuity
and
they
cost
six
guineas
for
seven
hours
they
did
her
no
end
of
good
all
through
the
precious
weekly
hour
she
sat
with
him
in
a
silent
twilight
very
very
still
and
feeling
oh
higher
than
anything
and
when
she
came
out
she
wore
an
inane
smile
on
her
face
and
was
prepared
not
to
worry
to
lie
with
facility
and
to
take
the
easiest
way
in
every
eventuality
in
an
entirely
satisfactory
and
exalted
manner
moreover
he
was
treating
her
investments
acting
upon
his
advice
and
doing
the
whole
thing
quietly
with
the
idea
of
preparing
a
pleasant
surprise
for
her
husband
she
had
sold
out
of
certain
home
railway
debentures
and
invested
in
a
company
for
working
the
auriferous
waste
which
is
so
abundant
in
the
drainage
of
philadelphia
a
company
whose
shareholders
were
chiefly
higher
thought
disciples
and
whose
profits
therefore
would
inevitably
be
greatly
enhanced
by
their
concerted
mental
action
it
was
to
the
prospective
profits
in
this
that
she
owed
the
new
black
furs
she
was
wearing
the
furs
and
the
bonnet
and
the
previous
day
treatment
she
had
had
all
helped
to
brace
her
up
on
marjorie
doorstep
for
a
complex
and
difficult
situation
and
to
carry
her
through
the
first
tensions
of
her
call
she
was
so
much
to
pieces
as
it
was
that
she
could
not
help
feeling
how
much
more
to
pieces
she
might
have
been
but
for
the
grace
of
silas
root
she
knew
she
ought
to
have
very
strong
feelings
about
trafford
though
it
was
not
really
clear
to
her
what
feelings
she
ought
to
have
on
the
whole
she
was
inclined
to
believe
she
was
experiencing
moral
disapproval
mixed
up
with
a
pathetic
and
rather
hopeless
appeal
for
the
welfare
of
the
tender
life
that
had
entrusted
itself
so
recklessly
to
these
brutal
and
discreditable
hands
though
indeed
if
she
had
really
dared
to
look
inside
her
mind
her
chief
discovery
would
have
been
a
keenly
jealous
appreciation
of
trafford
good
looks
and
generous
temper
and
a
feeling
of
injustice
as
between
her
own
lot
and
marjorie
however
going
on
her
assumed
basis
she
managed
to
be
very
pale
concise
and
at
any
mention
of
her
and
to
put
a
fervour
of
helpless
devotion
into
her
embraces
of
her
daughter
she
surveyed
the
house
with
a
pained
constrained
expression
as
though
she
tried
in
vain
to
conceal
from
herself
that
it
was
all
slightly
improper
and
even
such
objects
as
the
bokhara
hangings
failed
to
extort
more
than
an
insincere
oh
very
nice
dear
nice
in
the
bedroom
she
spoke
about
pope
he
was
dreadfully
upset
she
said
his
first
thought
was
to
come
after
you
both
with
a
pistol
if
if
had
married
you
but
dear
mummy
of
we
meant
to
marry
we
married
right
away
yes
dear
of
course
but
if
he
had
she
paused
and
marjorie
with
a
momentary
flush
of
indignation
in
her
cheeks
did
not
urge
her
to
conclude
her
explanation
he
said
pope
some
day
perhaps
he
come
round
you
were
always
his
favourite
daughter
i
know
said
marjorie
concisely
with
a
faint
flavour
of
cynicism
in
her
voice
i
afraid
dear
at
present
he
will
do
nothing
for
you
i
do
think
rag
would
like
him
to
said
marjorie
with
an
unreal
serenity
for
a
time
i
afraid
he
refuse
to
see
you
he
just
wants
to
forget
everything
poor
old
dad
i
wish
he
would
put
himself
out
like
this
still
i
wo
bother
him
mummy
if
you
mean
that
then
suddenly
into
pope
unsystematic
unstable
mind
started
perhaps
by
the
ring
in
her
daughter
voice
there
came
a
wave
of
affectionate
feeling
that
she
had
somehow
to
be
hostile
and
unsympathetic
to
marjorie
that
she
had
to
pretend
that
trafford
was
wicked
and
disgusting
and
not
be
happy
in
the
jolly
hope
and
happiness
of
this
bright
little
house
cut
her
with
a
keen
swift
pain
she
know
clearly
why
she
was
taking
this
coldly
hostile
attitude
or
why
she
went
on
doing
so
but
the
sense
of
that
necessity
hurt
her
none
the
less
she
put
out
her
hands
upon
her
daughter
shoulders
and
whimpered
oh
my
dear
i
do
wish
things
were
so
difficult
so
very
difficult
the
whimper
changed
by
some
inner
force
of
its
own
to
honest
sobs
and
tears
marjorie
passed
through
a
flash
of
amazement
to
a
sudden
understanding
of
her
mother
case
poor
dear
mummy
she
said
oh
poor
dear
mummy
it
a
shame
of
us
she
put
her
arms
about
her
mother
and
held
her
for
awhile
it
a
shame
said
her
mother
in
a
muffled
voice
trying
to
keep
hold
of
this
elusive
thing
that
had
somehow
both
wounded
her
and
won
her
daughter
back
but
her
poor
grasp
slipped
again
i
knew
you
come
to
see
it
she
said
dabbing
with
her
handkerchief
at
her
eyes
i
knew
you
would
and
then
with
the
habitual
loyalty
of
years
resuming
its
sway
he
always
been
so
good
to
but
pope
had
something
more
definite
to
say
to
marjorie
and
came
to
it
at
last
with
a
tactful
offhandedness
marjorie
communicated
it
to
trafford
about
an
hour
later
on
his
return
from
the
laboratory
i
say
she
said
old
daffy
engaged
to
magnet
she
paused
and
added
with
just
the
faintest
trace
of
resentment
in
her
voice
she
can
have
him
as
far
as
i
concerned
he
did
wait
long
said
trafford
tactlessly
no
said
marjorie
he
did
wait
long
of
course
she
got
him
on
the
pope
was
only
a
day
or
so
ahead
of
a
cloud
of
callers
the
carmel
girls
followed
close
upon
her
tall
figures
of
black
fur
with
muffs
and
a
rich
glitter
at
neck
and
wrist
marjorie
displayed
her
house
talking
fluently
about
other
things
and
watching
for
effects
the
carmel
girls
ran
their
swift
dark
eyes
over
her
appointments
glanced
quickly
from
side
to
side
of
her
rooms
saw
only
too
certainly
that
the
house
was
narrow
and
small
but
did
they
see
that
it
was
clever
they
saw
at
any
rate
that
she
meant
it
to
be
clever
and
with
true
oriental
politeness
said
as
much
urgently
and
extravagantly
then
there
were
the
rambord
girls
and
their
mother
an
unobservant
lot
who
chattered
about
the
ice
at
prince
then
constance
graham
came
with
a
thoroughbred
but
very
dirty
aunt
and
then
ottiline
winchelsea
with
an
american
minor
poet
who
wanted
a
view
of
mountains
from
the
windows
at
the
back
and
said
the
bathroom
ought
to
be
done
in
pink
then
lady
solomonson
came
an
extremely
fair
lady
with
an
affectation
of
cynicism
a
keen
intelligence
acutely
apt
conversation
and
a
queer
effect
of
thinking
of
something
else
all
the
time
she
was
talking
she
missed
nothing
hardly
anybody
failed
to
appreciate
the
charm
and
decision
of
use
of
those
bokhara
embroideries
they
would
have
been
cheap
at
double
the
price
and
then
our
two
young
people
went
out
to
their
first
together
they
began
with
trafford
rich
friend
solomonson
who
had
played
so
large
and
so
passive
a
part
in
their
first
meeting
he
had
behaved
with
a
sort
of
magnanimous
triumph
over
the
marriage
he
made
it
almost
his
personal
affair
as
though
he
had
brought
it
about
i
knew
there
was
a
girl
in
it
he
insisted
and
you
told
me
there
was
and
you
kept
me
in
that
smell
of
disinfectant
and
things
what
a
chap
that
doctor
was
for
spilling
stuff
for
six
blessed
days
marjorie
achieved
a
dress
at
once
simple
and
good
with
great
facility
by
not
asking
the
price
until
it
was
all
over
there
is
no
with
either
the
thing
is
a
success
and
inestimable
or
not
worth
having
at
any
price
at
all
it
was
blue
with
a
thread
of
gold
and
she
had
a
necklace
of
blueish
moonstones
and
her
hair
ceased
to
be
copper
and
became
golden
and
her
eyes
unfathomable
blue
she
was
radiant
with
health
and
happiness
no
one
else
there
had
her
clear
freshness
and
her
manner
was
as
restrained
and
dignified
and
ready
as
a
proud
young
wife
can
be
everyone
seemed
to
like
her
and
respect
her
and
be
interested
in
her
and
trafford
kissed
her
flushed
cheek
in
the
hansom
as
they
came
home
again
and
crowned
her
happiness
it
had
been
quite
a
large
party
and
really
much
more
splendid
and
brilliant
than
anything
she
had
ever
seen
before
there
had
been
one
old
gentleman
with
a
coloured
button
and
another
with
a
ribbon
there
had
been
a
countess
with
historical
pearls
and
other
people
one
might
fairly
call
distinguished
the
house
was
tremendous
in
its
way
spacious
rich
glowing
with
lights
abounding
in
vistas
and
fine
remote
backgrounds
in
the
midst
of
it
all
she
had
a
sudden
thrill
at
the
memory
that
less
than
a
year
ago
she
had
been
ignominiously
dismissed
from
the
by
her
father
for
a
hiccup
a
few
days
after
aunt
plessington
suddenly
asked
the
traffords
to
one
of
her
less
important
but
still
interesting
gatherings
not
one
of
those
that
swayed
the
world
perhaps
but
one
which
marjorie
was
given
to
understand
achieved
important
subordinate
wagging
aunt
plessington
had
not
called
she
explained
in
her
note
because
of
the
urgent
demands
the
movement
made
upon
her
time
it
was
her
wonderful
way
never
to
call
on
anyone
and
it
added
tremendously
to
her
reputation
none
the
less
it
appeared
though
here
the
scrawl
became
illegible
she
meant
to
shove
and
steer
her
dear
niece
upward
at
a
tremendous
pace
they
were
even
asked
to
come
a
little
early
so
that
she
might
make
trafford
acquaintance
the
dress
was
duly
admired
and
then
aunt
plessington
assuming
the
hearthrug
and
forgetting
the
little
matter
of
their
career
explained
quite
napoleonic
and
wonderful
things
she
was
going
to
do
with
her
movement
fresh
principles
fresh
applications
a
big
committee
of
all
the
names
they
were
easy
to
get
if
you
did
bother
them
to
do
things
a
new
and
more
attractive
title
payment
in
kind
was
to
give
way
to
reality
of
reward
and
she
herself
was
going
to
have
her
hair
bleached
bright
white
which
would
set
off
her
eyes
and
colour
and
the
general
geniality
of
appearance
due
to
her
projecting
teeth
and
so
greatly
increase
her
platform
efficiency
hubert
she
said
was
toiling
away
hard
at
the
detail
of
these
new
endeavours
he
would
be
down
in
a
few
minutes
time
marjorie
she
said
ought
to
speak
at
their
meetings
it
would
help
both
the
traffords
to
get
on
if
marjorie
cut
a
dash
at
the
outset
and
there
was
no
such
dash
to
be
cut
as
speaking
at
aunt
plessington
meetings
it
was
catching
on
all
next
season
it
was
sure
to
be
the
thing
so
many
promising
girls
allowed
themselves
to
be
submerged
altogether
in
marriage
for
a
time
and
when
they
emerged
everyone
had
forgotten
the
promise
of
their
début
she
had
an
air
of
rescuing
marjorie
from
an
impending
fate
by
disabusing
trafford
from
injurious
prepossessions
presently
the
guests
began
to
drop
in
a
vegetarian
health
specialist
a
rising
young
woman
factory
inspector
a
phrenologist
who
was
being
induced
to
put
great
talents
to
better
uses
under
aunt
influence
his
dumb
obscure
but
inevitable
wife
a
colonial
bishop
a
baroness
with
a
taste
rather
than
a
capacity
for
intellectual
society
a
wealthy
jam
and
pickle
manufacturer
and
his
wife
who
had
subscribed
largely
to
the
funds
of
the
movement
and
wanted
to
meet
the
lady
of
title
and
the
editor
of
the
movement
organ
and
a
young
gentleman
of
abundant
hair
and
cadaverous
silences
whom
aunt
plessington
patted
on
the
shoulder
and
spoke
of
as
one
of
our
discoveries
and
then
uncle
hubert
came
down
looking
ruffled
and
overworked
with
his
he
was
one
of
those
men
who
can
never
master
the
art
of
tying
a
bow
very
much
askew
the
conversation
turned
chiefly
on
the
movement
if
it
strayed
aunt
plessington
reached
out
her
voice
after
it
and
brought
it
back
in
a
masterful
manner
through
soup
and
fish
marjorie
occupied
herself
with
the
inflexible
rigour
of
the
young
editor
who
had
brought
her
down
when
she
could
give
her
attention
to
the
general
conversation
she
discovered
her
husband
a
little
flushed
and
tackling
her
aunt
with
an
expression
of
quiet
determination
the
phrenologist
and
the
vegetarian
health
specialist
were
regarding
him
with
amazement
the
jam
and
pickle
manufacturer
wife
was
evidently
deeply
shocked
he
was
refusing
to
believe
in
the
value
of
the
movement
and
aunt
plessington
was
manifestly
losing
her
temper
i
do
see
plessington
he
was
saying
that
all
this
amounts
to
more
than
a
kind
of
glorious
district
visiting
that
is
how
i
see
it
you
want
to
attack
people
in
their
homes
before
they
cry
out
to
you
you
want
to
compel
them
by
this
payment
in
kind
of
yours
to
do
what
you
want
them
to
do
instead
of
trying
to
make
them
want
to
do
it
now
i
think
your
business
is
to
make
them
want
to
do
it
you
may
perhaps
increase
the
amount
of
milk
in
babies
and
the
amount
of
whitewash
in
cottages
and
slums
by
your
methods
i
do
dispute
the
promise
of
your
statistics
but
you
going
to
do
it
at
a
cost
of
human
that
out
of
all
proportion
uncle
hubert
voice
with
that
thick
utterance
that
always
suggested
a
mouthful
of
plums
came
booming
down
the
table
all
these
arguments
he
said
have
been
answered
long
ago
no
doubt
said
trafford
with
a
faint
asperity
but
tell
me
the
answers
it
ridiculous
said
aunt
plessington
to
talk
of
the
of
the
kind
of
people
oh
the
very
dregs
it
just
because
the
plant
is
delicate
that
you
got
to
handle
it
carefully
said
trafford
here
miss
gant
said
aunt
plessington
knows
the
strata
we
are
discussing
she
tell
you
they
have
positively
none
at
all
people
said
miss
gant
as
if
in
conclusive
testimony
actually
conspire
with
their
employers
to
defeat
me
i
do
see
the
absence
of
in
that
said
trafford
but
all
their
interests
i
thinking
of
their
the
discussion
lasted
to
the
end
of
dinner
and
made
no
headway
as
soon
as
the
ladies
were
in
the
aunt
plessington
a
little
flushed
from
the
conflict
turned
on
marjorie
and
said
i
your
husband
he
but
he
young
and
he
certainly
spirited
he
to
get
on
if
he
wants
to
does
he
do
nothing
but
his
researches
he
lectures
in
the
spring
term
said
marjorie
ah
said
aunt
plessington
with
a
triumphant
note
you
must
alter
all
that
you
must
interest
him
in
wider
things
you
must
bring
him
out
of
his
shell
and
let
him
see
what
it
is
to
deal
with
affairs
then
he
would
talk
such
nonsense
about
our
work
marjory
was
at
a
momentary
loss
for
a
reply
and
in
the
respite
aunt
plessington
turned
to
the
jam
and
pickle
lady
and
asked
in
a
bright
encouraging
note
well
and
how
the
village
club
getting
on
she
had
another
lunge
at
trafford
as
he
took
his
leave
you
must
come
again
soon
she
said
i
a
good
wrangle
and
hubert
and
i
never
want
to
talk
about
our
movement
to
any
one
but
unbelievers
you
know
the
beginnings
of
it
yet
only
i
warn
you
they
have
a
way
of
getting
converted
i
warn
on
this
occasion
there
was
no
kissing
in
the
cab
trafford
was
exasperated
of
all
the
intolerable
women
he
said
and
was
silent
for
a
time
the
astounding
part
of
it
is
he
burst
out
that
this
sort
of
thing
this
movement
and
all
the
rest
of
it
does
really
give
the
quality
of
english
public
affairs
it
like
a
sample
dredged
the
the
of
it
raised
voices
rash
assertions
sham
investigations
meetings
and
committees
and
meetings
that
the
stuff
of
it
and
politicians
really
have
to
attend
to
it
and
silly
ineffective
irritating
bills
really
get
drafted
and
messed
about
with
and
passed
on
the
strength
of
it
public
affairs
are
still
in
the
dark
ages
nobody
now
would
think
of
getting
together
a
scratch
committee
of
rich
old
women
and
miscellaneous
conspicuous
people
to
design
an
electric
tram
and
jabbering
and
jabbering
and
jabbering
and
if
any
one
objects
a
note
of
personal
bitterness
came
into
his
voice
jabbering
faster
but
nobody
thinks
it
ridiculous
to
attempt
the
organization
of
poor
affairs
in
that
sort
of
way
this
project
of
the
supersession
of
wages
by
payment
in
kind
oh
it
childish
if
it
was
it
would
be
outrageous
and
indecent
your
uncle
and
aunt
have
thought
for
a
moment
of
any
single
one
of
the
necessary
consequences
of
these
things
they
say
their
confounded
movement
aims
at
effects
upon
the
race
upon
public
spirit
upon
people
habits
and
motives
they
just
a
queer
craving
to
feel
powerful
and
influential
which
they
think
they
can
best
satisfy
by
upsetting
the
lives
of
no
end
of
harmless
poor
people
the
only
people
they
dare
upset
and
that
about
as
far
as
they
go
your
aunt
detestable
marjorie
marjorie
had
never
seen
him
so
deeply
affected
by
anything
but
herself
it
seemed
to
her
he
was
needlessly
disturbed
by
a
trivial
matter
he
sulked
for
a
space
and
then
broke
out
again
that
confounded
woman
talks
of
my
physical
science
he
said
as
if
research
were
an
amiable
weakness
like
collecting
postage
stamps
and
it
changed
human
conditions
more
in
the
last
ten
years
than
all
the
parliamentary
and
legislators
and
administrative
experts
have
done
in
two
centuries
and
for
all
that
there
more
clerks
in
whitehall
than
professors
of
physics
in
the
whole
of
i
suppose
it
the
way
that
sort
of
thing
gets
done
said
marjorie
after
an
interval
that
sort
of
thing
does
get
done
snapped
trafford
all
these
people
burble
about
with
their
movements
and
jobs
and
lectures
and
stuff
and
like
some
one
getting
squashed
to
death
in
a
crowd
nobody
did
it
but
anybody
in
the
muddle
can
claim
to
have
done
it
if
only
they
got
the
cheek
of
your
aunt
plessington
he
seemed
to
have
finished
he
suddenly
broke
out
again
why
people
like
your
aunt
plessington
do
even
know
where
the
handle
is
if
they
ventured
to
look
for
it
they
give
the
whole
show
away
done
indeed
here
we
are
said
marjorie
a
little
relieved
to
find
the
hansom
turning
out
of
king
road
into
their
own
side
street
and
then
marjorie
wore
the
blue
dress
with
great
success
at
the
carmels
the
girls
came
and
looked
at
it
and
admired
it
it
was
no
mere
politeness
they
admitted
there
was
style
about
it
a
quality
there
was
no
explaining
you
madge
cried
the
younger
carmel
girl
the
carmel
boy
seizing
the
opportunity
of
a
momentary
seclusion
in
a
corner
ended
a
short
but
rather
portentous
silence
with
i
say
you
look
ripping
in
a
voice
that
implied
the
keenest
regret
for
the
slacknesses
of
a
summer
that
was
now
infinitely
remote
to
marjorie
it
was
ridiculous
that
the
carmel
boy
should
have
such
emotions
he
was
six
years
younger
than
trafford
and
only
a
year
older
than
marjorie
and
yet
she
was
pleased
by
his
manifest
wound
there
was
only
one
little
thing
at
the
back
of
her
mind
that
alloyed
her
sense
of
happy
and
complete
living
that
night
and
that
was
the
ghost
of
an
addition
sum
at
home
in
her
pretty
bureau
a
little
gathering
pile
of
bills
as
yet
unpaid
and
an
empty
with
appealing
counterfoils
awaited
her
attention
marjorie
had
still
to
master
the
fact
that
all
the
fine
braveries
and
interests
and
delights
of
life
that
offer
themselves
so
amply
to
the
favoured
children
of
civilization
trail
and
since
the
fall
of
man
at
any
rate
have
trailed
after
them
something
something
the
justification
of
morality
the
despair
of
all
easy
happy
souls
the
unavoidable
drop
of
bitterness
in
the
cup
of
pleasure
the
reckoning
chapter
the
second
the
child
of
the
ages
when
the
intellectual
history
of
this
time
comes
to
be
written
nothing
i
think
will
stand
out
more
strikingly
than
the
empty
gulf
in
quality
between
the
superb
and
richly
fruitful
scientific
investigations
that
are
going
on
and
the
general
thought
of
other
educated
sections
of
the
community
i
do
not
mean
that
the
scientific
men
are
as
a
whole
a
class
of
supermen
dealing
with
and
thinking
about
everything
in
a
way
altogether
better
than
the
common
run
of
humanity
but
that
in
their
own
field
they
think
and
work
with
an
intensity
an
integrity
a
breadth
boldness
patience
thoroughness
and
faithfulness
that
excepting
only
a
few
artists
puts
their
work
out
of
all
comparison
with
any
other
human
activity
often
the
field
in
which
the
work
is
done
is
very
narrow
and
almost
universally
the
underlying
philosophy
is
felt
rather
than
apprehended
a
scientific
man
may
be
large
and
deliberate
and
personally
detached
in
his
work
and
hasty
commonplace
and
superficial
in
every
other
relation
of
life
nevertheless
it
is
true
that
in
these
particular
directions
the
human
mind
has
achieved
a
new
and
higher
quality
of
attitude
and
gesture
a
veracity
and
vigour
of
criticism
that
tend
to
spread
out
and
must
ultimately
spread
out
to
every
other
human
affair
in
these
uncontroversial
issues
at
least
mankind
has
learnt
the
rich
rewards
that
ensue
from
patience
and
infinite
pains
the
peculiar
circumstances
of
trafford
birth
and
upbringing
had
accentuated
his
natural
disposition
toward
this
new
thoroughness
of
intellectual
treatment
which
has
always
distinguished
the
great
artist
and
which
is
also
the
essential
quality
of
the
scientific
method
he
had
lived
apart
from
any
urgency
to
produce
and
compete
in
the
common
business
of
the
world
his
natural
curiosities
fed
and
encouraged
by
his
natural
gifts
had
grown
into
a
steady
passion
for
clarity
and
knowledge
but
with
him
there
was
no
specialization
he
brought
out
from
his
laboratory
into
the
everyday
affairs
of
the
world
the
same
sceptical
restraint
of
judgment
which
is
the
touchstone
of
scientific
truth
this
made
him
a
tepid
and
indeed
rather
a
scornful
spectator
of
political
and
social
life
party
formulae
international
rivalries
social
customs
and
very
much
of
the
ordinary
law
of
our
state
impressed
him
as
a
kind
of
fungoid
growth
out
of
a
fundamental
intellectual
muddle
it
all
maintained
itself
hazardously
changing
and
adapting
itself
unintelligently
to
unseen
conditions
he
saw
no
ultimate
truth
in
this
seething
welter
of
human
efforts
no
tragedy
as
yet
in
its
defeats
no
value
in
its
victories
it
had
to
go
on
he
believed
until
the
spreading
certitudes
of
the
scientific
method
pierced
its
unsubstantial
thickets
burst
its
delusive
films
drained
away
its
folly
aunt
plessington
talk
of
order
and
progress
and
the
influence
of
her
movement
impressed
his
mind
very
much
as
the
cackle
of
some
larger
kind
of
hen
which
cackles
because
it
must
only
aunt
plessington
being
human
simply
imagined
the
egg
she
laid
on
the
plane
of
the
ideal
when
the
great
nonsensical
issues
between
liberal
and
conservative
between
socialist
and
individualist
between
and
teuton
between
the
white
race
and
the
yellow
race
arose
in
trafford
company
he
would
if
he
felt
cheerful
take
one
side
or
the
other
as
chance
or
his
amusement
with
his
interlocutors
determined
and
jest
and
gibe
at
the
opponent
inconsistencies
and
if
on
the
other
hand
he
chanced
to
be
irritable
he
would
lose
his
temper
at
this
chewing
of
mesembryanthemum
and
sulk
into
silence
chewing
mesembryanthemum
was
one
of
favourite
images
no
doubt
the
reader
knows
that
abundant
fleshy
mediterranean
weed
and
the
weakly
unpleasant
wateriness
of
its
substance
he
went
back
to
his
laboratory
and
his
proper
work
after
such
discussions
with
a
feeling
of
escape
as
if
he
shut
a
door
upon
a
dirty
and
undisciplined
crowded
with
mental
defectives
yet
even
before
he
met
and
married
marjorie
there
was
a
queer
little
undertow
of
thought
in
his
mind
which
insisted
that
this
business
could
not
end
with
that
he
did
altogether
leave
the
social
confusion
outside
his
panels
when
he
stood
alone
before
his
apparatus
and
that
sooner
or
later
that
babble
of
voices
would
force
his
defences
and
overcome
his
disdain
his
particular
work
upon
the
intimate
constitution
of
matter
had
broadened
very
rapidly
in
his
hands
the
drift
of
his
work
had
been
to
identify
all
colloids
as
liquid
solutions
of
variable
degrees
of
viscosity
and
to
treat
crystalline
bodies
as
the
only
solids
he
had
dealt
with
oscillating
processes
in
colloid
bodies
with
especial
reference
to
living
matter
he
had
passed
from
a
study
of
the
melting
and
toughening
of
glass
to
the
molecular
structure
of
a
number
of
elastic
bodies
and
so
by
a
characteristic
leap
into
botanical
physiology
to
the
states
of
resinous
and
gummy
substances
at
the
moment
of
secretion
he
worked
at
first
upon
a
false
start
and
then
resumed
to
discover
a
growing
illumination
he
found
himself
in
the
presence
of
phenomena
that
seemed
to
him
to
lie
near
the
still
undiscovered
threshold
to
the
secret
processes
of
living
protoplasm
he
was
as
it
were
breaking
into
biology
by
way
of
molecular
physics
he
spent
many
long
nights
of
deep
excitement
calculating
and
arranging
the
development
of
these
seductive
intimations
it
was
this
work
which
his
marriage
had
interrupted
and
to
which
he
was
now
returning
he
was
surprised
to
find
how
difficult
it
was
to
take
it
up
again
he
had
been
only
two
months
away
from
it
and
yet
already
it
had
not
a
little
of
the
feeling
of
a
relic
taken
from
a
drawer
something
had
faded
it
was
at
first
as
if
a
film
had
come
over
his
eyes
so
that
he
could
no
longer
see
these
things
clearly
and
subtly
and
closely
his
senses
his
emotions
had
been
living
in
a
stirring
and
vivid
illumination
now
in
this
cool
quietude
bright
clouds
of
coloured
swam
distractingly
before
his
eyes
phantom
kisses
on
his
lips
the
memory
of
touches
and
the
echoing
vibrations
of
an
adorable
voice
the
thought
of
a
gay
delightful
fireside
and
the
fresh
recollection
of
a
companion
intensely
felt
beside
him
effaced
the
delicate
profundities
of
this
dim
place
durgan
hovered
about
him
helpful
and
a
mute
reproach
trafford
had
to
force
his
attention
daily
for
the
better
part
of
two
weeks
before
he
had
fully
recovered
the
fine
enchanting
interest
of
that
suspended
work
at
last
one
day
he
had
the
happiness
of
possession
again
he
had
exactly
the
sensation
one
gets
when
some
hitherto
intractable
piece
of
a
machine
one
is
putting
together
clicks
neatly
and
beyond
all
hoping
into
its
place
he
found
himself
working
in
the
old
style
with
the
hours
slipping
by
disregarded
he
sent
out
durgan
to
get
him
tobacco
and
tea
and
sandwiches
and
he
stayed
in
the
laboratory
all
night
he
went
home
about
five
and
found
a
marjorie
still
dressed
wrapped
in
a
and
crumpled
and
asleep
in
his
study
beside
the
grey
ashes
of
an
extinct
fire
in
the
instant
before
she
awoke
he
could
see
what
a
fragile
and
pitiful
being
a
healthy
and
happy
young
wife
can
appear
her
pose
revealed
an
unsuspected
slender
weakness
of
body
her
face
something
infantile
and
wistful
he
had
still
to
reckon
with
she
awoke
with
a
start
and
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
and
at
the
room
about
her
oh
where
have
you
been
she
asked
almost
querulously
where
you
been
but
my
dear
he
said
as
one
might
speak
to
a
child
why
are
you
in
bed
it
just
dawn
oh
she
said
i
waited
and
i
waited
it
seemed
you
come
i
read
a
book
and
then
i
fell
asleep
and
then
with
a
sob
of
feeble
and
here
i
am
she
rubbed
the
back
of
her
hand
into
one
eye
and
shivered
i
cold
she
said
and
i
want
some
tea
let
make
some
said
trafford
it
been
horrible
waiting
said
marjorie
without
moving
horrible
where
have
you
been
i
been
working
i
got
excited
by
my
work
i
been
at
the
laboratory
i
had
the
best
spell
of
work
i
ever
had
since
our
marriage
but
i
have
been
up
all
night
she
cried
with
her
face
and
voice
softening
to
tears
how
you
how
you
he
was
surprised
by
her
weeping
he
was
still
more
surprised
by
the
that
allowed
her
to
continue
i
been
working
he
repeated
and
then
looked
about
with
a
man
helplessness
for
the
tea
apparatus
one
must
have
hot
water
and
a
teapot
and
a
kettle
he
would
find
those
in
the
kitchen
he
strolled
thoughtfully
out
of
the
room
thinking
out
the
further
details
of
all
mixed
up
with
amazement
at
marjorie
while
she
sat
wiping
her
eyes
with
a
crumpled
presently
she
followed
him
down
with
the
rug
about
her
like
a
shawl
and
stood
watching
him
as
he
lit
a
fire
of
wood
and
paper
among
the
ashes
in
the
kitchen
fireplace
it
been
dreadful
she
said
not
offering
to
help
you
see
he
said
on
his
knees
i
really
got
hold
of
my
work
at
last
but
you
should
have
sent
i
was
thinking
of
my
work
i
clean
forgot
forgot
absolutely
forgot
of
course
said
trafford
with
a
slightly
puzzled
air
you
do
see
it
as
i
do
the
kettle
engaged
him
for
a
time
then
he
threw
out
a
suggestion
we
have
to
have
a
telephone
i
could
imagine
where
you
were
i
thought
of
all
sorts
of
things
i
almost
came
round
but
i
was
so
horribly
afraid
i
might
find
you
he
renewed
his
suggestion
of
a
telephone
so
that
if
i
really
want
you
said
marjorie
or
if
i
just
want
to
feel
you
there
yes
said
trafford
slowly
jabbing
a
piece
of
firewood
into
the
glow
but
it
was
chiefly
present
in
his
mind
that
much
of
that
elaborate
experimenting
of
his
was
at
all
a
thing
to
be
cut
athwart
by
the
exasperating
gusts
of
a
telephone
bell
clamouring
for
attention
hitherto
the
laboratory
telephone
had
been
in
the
habit
of
disconnecting
itself
early
in
the
afternoon
and
yet
after
all
it
was
this
instrument
the
same
twisted
wire
and
little
quivering
tympanum
that
had
brought
back
marjorie
into
his
life
and
now
trafford
fell
into
a
great
perplexity
of
mind
his
banker
had
called
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
account
was
overdrawn
to
the
extent
of
three
hundred
and
thirteen
pounds
and
he
had
been
under
that
vague
sort
of
impression
one
always
has
about
one
current
account
that
he
was
a
hundred
and
fifty
or
so
to
the
good
his
first
impression
was
that
those
hitherto
infallible
beings
those
unseen
gnomes
of
the
whose
lucid
figures
neat
tickings
and
unrelenting
additions
constituted
banks
to
his
imagination
must
have
made
a
mistake
his
second
that
some
one
had
tampered
with
a
cheque
his
third
thought
pointed
to
marjorie
and
the
easy
circumstances
of
his
home
for
a
fortnight
now
she
had
been
obviously
ailing
oddly
irritable
he
did
not
understand
the
change
in
her
but
it
sufficed
to
prevent
his
taking
the
thing
to
her
at
once
and
going
into
it
with
her
as
he
would
have
done
earlier
instead
he
had
sent
for
his
and
in
the
presence
of
its
neat
columns
realized
for
the
first
time
the
meaning
of
three
hundred
pounds
including
cheques
to
oxbridge
tradesmen
for
her
old
debts
she
had
spent
he
discovered
nearly
seven
hundred
and
fifty
he
sat
before
the
little
bundle
of
crumpled
strips
of
pink
and
white
perforated
purple
stamped
and
effaced
in
a
state
of
extreme
astonishment
it
was
no
small
factor
in
his
amazement
to
note
how
very
carelessly
some
of
those
cheques
of
marjorie
had
been
written
several
she
had
not
even
crossed
the
effect
of
it
all
was
that
she
just
spent
his
money
freely
with
an
utter
disregard
of
the
consequences
up
to
that
moment
it
had
never
occurred
to
trafford
that
anybody
one
really
cared
for
could
be
anything
but
punctilious
about
money
now
here
with
an
arithmetical
exactitude
of
demonstration
he
perceived
that
marjorie
was
it
was
so
tremendous
a
discovery
for
him
so
disconcerting
and
startling
that
he
did
for
two
days
say
a
word
to
her
about
it
he
could
think
of
a
word
to
say
he
felt
that
even
to
put
these
facts
before
her
amounted
to
an
accusation
of
disloyalty
and
selfishness
that
he
had
the
courage
to
make
his
work
stopped
altogether
he
struggled
hourly
with
that
accusation
did
she
realize
there
seemed
no
escape
from
his
dilemma
either
she
did
care
or
she
did
understand
his
thoughts
went
back
to
the
lake
of
orta
when
he
had
put
all
his
money
at
her
disposal
she
had
been
surprised
and
now
he
perceived
she
had
also
been
a
little
frightened
the
chief
excuse
he
could
find
for
her
was
that
she
was
inexperienced
absolutely
inexperienced
even
now
of
course
she
was
drawing
fresh
cheques
he
would
have
to
pull
himself
together
and
go
into
the
whole
thing
for
all
its
infinite
disagreeableness
with
her
but
it
was
marjorie
who
broached
the
subject
he
had
found
work
at
the
laboratory
unsatisfactory
and
after
lunching
at
his
club
he
had
come
home
and
gone
to
his
study
in
order
to
think
out
the
discussion
he
contemplated
with
her
she
came
in
to
him
as
he
sat
at
his
desk
busy
she
said
not
very
he
answered
and
she
came
up
to
him
kissed
his
head
and
stood
beside
him
with
her
hand
on
his
shoulder
she
asked
he
nodded
i
been
overrunning
no
end
the
matter
was
opened
what
would
she
say
she
bent
to
his
ear
and
whispered
i
going
to
overrun
some
more
his
voice
was
resentful
you
he
said
compactly
without
looking
at
her
you
spent
enough
there
things
what
things
her
answer
took
some
time
in
coming
we
have
to
give
a
wedding
present
to
daffy
i
shall
want
some
more
furniture
well
he
had
to
go
into
it
now
i
do
think
you
can
have
it
he
said
and
then
as
she
remained
silent
marjorie
do
you
know
how
much
money
i
got
six
thousand
i
but
we
spent
nearly
a
thousand
pounds
yes
one
thousand
pounds
over
and
above
income
we
meant
to
spend
four
hundred
and
now
we
got
hardly
anything
over
five
five
thousand
said
marjorie
five
thousand
and
there
your
salary
yes
but
at
this
pace
dear
said
marjorie
and
her
hands
came
about
his
neck
dear
something
she
broke
off
an
unfamiliar
quality
in
her
voice
struck
into
him
he
turned
his
head
to
see
her
face
rose
to
his
feet
staring
at
her
this
remarkable
young
woman
had
become
soft
and
wonderful
as
april
hills
across
which
clouds
are
sweeping
her
face
was
as
if
he
had
never
seen
it
before
her
eyes
bright
with
tears
oh
do
let
spoil
things
by
thinking
of
money
she
said
i
got
something
her
voice
fell
to
a
whisper
do
let
spoil
things
by
thinking
of
money
it
too
good
dear
to
be
true
it
too
good
to
be
true
it
makes
everything
perfect
we
have
to
furnish
that
little
room
i
did
dare
to
hope
it
somehow
i
been
so
excited
and
afraid
but
we
got
to
furnish
that
little
room
there
that
empty
little
room
upstairs
dear
that
we
left
over
oh
my
my
the
world
of
trafford
and
marjorie
was
filled
and
transfigured
by
the
advent
of
their
child
for
two
days
of
abundant
silences
he
had
been
preparing
a
statement
of
his
case
for
her
he
had
been
full
of
the
danger
to
his
research
and
all
the
waste
of
his
life
that
her
extravagance
threatened
he
wanted
to
tell
her
just
all
that
his
science
meant
to
him
explain
how
his
income
and
life
had
all
been
arranged
to
leave
him
mind
and
time
and
energy
free
for
these
commanding
investigations
his
life
was
to
him
the
service
of
knowledge
or
futility
he
had
perceived
that
she
did
not
understand
this
in
him
that
for
her
life
was
a
blaze
of
eagerly
sought
experiences
and
gratifications
so
far
he
had
thought
out
things
and
had
them
ready
for
her
but
now
all
this
impending
discussion
vanished
out
of
his
world
their
love
was
to
be
crowned
by
the
miracle
of
parentage
this
fact
flooded
his
outlook
and
submerged
every
other
consideration
this
manifest
probability
came
to
him
as
if
it
were
an
unforeseen
marvel
it
was
as
if
he
had
never
thought
of
such
a
thing
before
as
though
a
fact
entirely
novel
in
the
order
of
the
universe
had
come
into
existence
marjorie
became
again
magical
and
wonderful
for
him
but
in
a
manner
new
and
strange
she
was
grave
solemn
significant
he
was
filled
with
a
passionate
solicitude
for
her
welfare
and
a
passionate
desire
to
serve
her
it
seemed
impossible
to
him
that
only
a
day
or
so
ago
he
should
have
been
accusing
her
in
his
heart
of
disloyalty
and
searching
for
excuses
and
mitigations
all
the
freshness
of
his
first
love
for
marjorie
returned
his
keen
sense
of
the
sweet
gallantry
of
her
voice
and
bearing
his
admiration
for
the
swift
falconlike
swoop
of
her
decisions
for
the
grace
and
poise
of
her
body
and
the
steady
frankness
of
her
eyes
but
now
it
was
all
charged
with
his
sense
of
this
new
joint
life
germinating
at
the
heart
of
her
slender
vigour
spreading
throughout
her
being
to
change
it
altogether
into
womanhood
for
ever
in
this
new
light
his
passion
for
research
and
all
the
scheme
of
his
life
appeared
faded
and
unworthy
as
much
egotism
as
if
he
had
been
devoted
to
hunting
or
golf
or
any
such
aimless
preoccupation
fatherhood
gripped
him
and
faced
him
about
it
was
manifestly
a
monstrous
thing
that
he
should
ever
have
expected
marjorie
to
become
a
mere
undisturbing
accessory
to
the
selfish
intellectualism
of
his
career
to
shave
and
limit
herself
to
a
mere
bachelor
income
and
play
no
part
of
her
own
in
the
movement
of
the
world
he
knew
better
now
research
must
fall
into
its
proper
place
and
for
his
immediate
business
he
must
set
to
work
to
supplement
his
manifestly
inadequate
resources
at
first
he
could
form
no
plan
at
all
for
doing
that
he
determined
that
research
must
still
have
his
morning
hours
until
and
he
privately
resolved
some
part
of
the
night
the
rest
of
his
day
he
thought
he
would
set
aside
for
a
time
to
but
he
was
altogether
inexperienced
in
the
methods
of
it
was
a
new
problem
and
a
new
sort
of
problem
to
him
altogether
he
discovered
himself
helpless
and
rather
silly
in
the
matter
the
more
obvious
possibilities
seemed
to
be
that
he
might
lecture
upon
his
science
or
write
he
communicated
with
a
couple
of
lecture
agencies
and
was
amazed
at
their
scepticism
no
doubt
he
knew
his
science
on
that
point
they
were
complimentary
in
a
profuse
unconvincing
manner
but
could
he
interest
like
x
and
here
they
named
a
notorious
quack
could
he
he
offered
science
notes
to
a
weekly
periodical
the
editor
answered
that
for
the
purposes
of
his
publication
he
preferred
as
between
professors
and
journalists
journalists
you
real
scientific
men
he
said
are
no
doubt
a
thousand
times
more
accurate
and
novel
and
all
that
but
as
no
one
seems
able
to
understand
you
he
went
to
his
old
gwenn
who
was
editing
scientific
and
through
him
he
secured
some
lectures
which
involved
he
found
travelling
about
miles
weekly
at
the
rate
of
a
mile
counting
nothing
for
the
lectures
afterwards
gwenn
arranged
for
some
regular
notes
on
physics
and
trafford
made
out
a
weekly
on
whose
white
of
dignity
leisure
and
the
honourable
pursuit
of
knowledge
a
diaper
of
red
marked
the
claims
of
domestic
necessity
it
was
astonishing
how
completely
this
coming
child
dominated
the
whole
atmosphere
and
all
the
circumstances
of
the
traffords
it
became
their
central
fact
to
which
everything
else
turned
and
pointed
its
effect
on
marjorie
circle
of
school
and
college
friends
was
prodigious
she
was
the
first
of
their
company
to
cross
the
mysterious
boundaries
of
a
woman
life
she
became
to
them
a
heroine
mingled
with
something
of
the
priestess
they
called
upon
her
more
abundantly
and
sat
with
her
noted
the
change
in
her
eyes
and
voice
and
bearing
talking
with
a
kind
of
awe
and
a
faint
diffidence
of
the
promised
new
life
many
of
them
had
been
deeply
tinged
by
the
women
suffrage
movement
the
feminist
note
was
strong
among
them
and
when
one
afternoon
ottiline
winchelsea
brought
round
agatha
alimony
the
novelist
and
agatha
said
in
that
voice
of
hers
i
hope
it
will
be
a
girl
so
that
presently
she
may
fight
the
battle
of
her
sex
there
was
the
profoundest
emotion
but
when
marjorie
conveyed
that
to
trafford
he
was
lacking
in
response
i
want
a
boy
he
said
and
being
pressed
for
a
reason
explained
oh
one
likes
to
have
a
boy
i
want
him
with
just
your
quick
eyes
and
ears
my
dear
and
just
my
own
safe
and
certain
hands
pope
received
the
news
with
that
depth
and
aimless
complexity
of
emotion
which
had
now
become
her
habitual
method
with
marjorie
she
kissed
and
clasped
her
daughter
and
thought
confusedly
over
her
shoulder
and
said
of
course
dear
oh
i
so
hope
it
annoy
your
father
daffy
was
nice
but
vague
and
sufficiently
feminist
to
wish
it
a
daughter
and
the
said
and
changed
the
subject
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
but
theodore
was
deeply
moved
at
the
prospect
of
becoming
an
uncle
and
went
apart
and
mused
deeply
and
darkly
thereon
for
some
time
it
was
difficult
to
tell
just
what
trafford
mother
thought
she
was
complex
and
subtle
and
evidently
did
not
show
marjorie
all
that
was
in
her
mind
but
at
any
rate
it
was
clear
the
prospect
of
a
grandchild
pleased
and
interested
her
and
about
aunt
plessington
views
there
was
no
manner
of
doubt
at
all
she
thought
and
remarked
judicially
as
one
might
criticize
a
game
of
billiards
that
on
the
whole
it
was
just
a
little
bit
too
soon
marjorie
kept
well
throughout
march
and
april
and
then
suddenly
she
grew
unutterably
weary
and
uncomfortable
in
london
the
end
of
april
came
hot
and
close
and
dry
it
might
have
been
july
for
the
heat
the
scrap
of
garden
wilted
and
the
streets
were
irritating
with
fine
dust
and
blown
scraps
of
paper
and
drifting
straws
she
could
think
of
nothing
but
the
shade
of
trees
and
cornfields
under
sunlight
and
the
shadows
of
passing
clouds
so
trafford
took
out
an
old
bicycle
and
wandered
over
the
home
counties
for
three
days
and
at
last
hit
upon
a
little
country
cottage
near
great
missenden
a
cottage
a
couple
of
girl
artists
had
furnished
and
now
wanted
to
let
it
had
a
long
untidy
vegetable
garden
and
a
small
orchard
and
with
an
old
superannuated
humbug
of
a
near
the
centre
surrounded
by
a
green
seat
and
high
hedges
with
the
promise
of
honeysuckle
and
and
gaps
that
opened
into
hospitable
beechwoods
woods
not
so
thick
but
that
there
were
glades
of
bluebells
bracken
and
to
be
exact
in
places
embattled
he
took
it
and
engaged
a
minute
active
interested
philoprogenitive
servant
girl
for
it
and
took
marjorie
thither
in
a
she
went
out
wrapped
in
a
shawl
and
sat
under
the
and
cried
quietly
with
weakness
and
sentiment
and
the
tenderness
of
afternoon
sunshine
and
forthwith
began
to
pick
up
wonderfully
and
was
presently
writing
to
trafford
to
buy
her
a
dog
to
go
for
walks
with
while
he
was
away
in
london
trafford
was
still
struggling
along
with
his
research
in
spite
of
a
constant
gravitation
to
the
cottage
and
marjorie
side
but
he
was
also
doing
his
best
to
grapple
with
the
difficulties
of
his
financial
situation
his
science
notes
which
were
very
uncongenial
and
difficult
to
do
and
his
lecturing
still
left
his
income
far
behind
his
expenditure
and
the
problem
of
minimising
the
inevitable
fresh
inroads
on
his
capital
was
insistent
and
distracting
he
discovered
that
he
could
manage
his
notes
more
easily
and
write
a
more
popular
article
if
he
dictated
to
a
typist
instead
of
writing
out
the
stuff
in
his
own
manuscript
dictating
made
his
sentences
more
copious
and
open
and
the
effect
of
the
young
lady
by
no
means
acquiescent
back
was
to
make
him
far
more
explicit
than
he
tended
to
be
pen
in
hand
with
a
pen
and
alone
he
felt
the
boredom
of
the
job
unendurably
and
to
be
through
with
it
became
more
and
more
terse
allusive
and
compactly
technical
after
the
style
of
his
original
papers
one
or
two
articles
by
him
were
accepted
and
published
by
the
monthly
magazines
but
as
he
took
what
the
editors
sent
him
he
did
not
find
this
led
to
any
excessive
opulence
but
his
heart
was
very
much
with
marjorie
through
all
this
time
hitherto
he
had
taken
her
health
and
vigour
and
companionship
for
granted
and
it
changed
his
attitudes
profoundly
to
find
her
now
an
ailing
thing
making
an
invincible
appeal
for
restraint
and
consideration
and
help
she
changed
marvellously
she
gained
a
new
dignity
and
her
complexion
took
upon
itself
a
fresh
soft
beauty
he
would
spend
three
or
four
days
out
of
a
week
at
the
cottage
and
long
hours
of
that
would
be
at
her
side
paper
and
notes
of
some
forthcoming
lecture
at
hand
neglected
talking
to
her
consolingly
and
dreamingly
his
thoughts
were
full
of
ideas
about
education
he
was
obsessed
as
are
most
intelligent
young
parents
of
the
modern
type
by
the
enormous
possibilities
of
human
improvement
that
might
be
achieved
if
only
one
could
begin
with
a
baby
from
the
outset
on
the
best
lines
with
the
best
methods
training
and
preparing
it
presumably
for
a
cleaned
and
chastened
world
indeed
he
made
all
the
usual
discoveries
of
intelligent
modern
young
parents
very
rapidly
fully
and
completely
and
overlooked
most
of
those
practical
difficulties
that
finally
reduce
them
to
human
dimensions
again
in
quite
the
normal
fashion
i
sit
and
muse
sometimes
when
i
ought
to
be
computing
he
said
old
durgan
watches
me
and
grunts
but
think
if
we
take
reasonable
care
watch
its
phases
stand
ready
with
a
kindergarten
toy
directly
it
stretches
out
its
hand
think
what
we
can
make
of
it
we
will
make
it
the
most
wonderful
child
in
the
world
said
marjorie
indeed
what
else
can
it
be
your
eyes
said
trafford
and
my
hands
a
girl
a
boy
he
kissed
her
white
and
passive
wrist
the
child
was
born
a
little
before
expectation
at
the
cottage
throughout
a
long
summer
night
and
day
in
early
september
its
coming
into
the
world
was
a
long
and
painful
struggle
the
general
practitioner
who
had
seemed
two
days
before
a
competent
and
worthy
person
enough
revealed
himself
as
hesitating
and
he
had
a
lingering
theological
objection
to
the
use
of
chloroform
and
the
nurse
from
london
sulked
under
his
directions
and
came
and
discussed
his
methods
scornfully
with
trafford
from
sundown
until
daylight
trafford
chafed
in
the
little
and
tried
to
sleep
and
hovered
listening
at
the
foot
of
the
narrow
staircase
to
the
room
above
he
lived
through
interminable
hours
of
moaning
and
suspense
the
dawn
and
sunrise
came
with
a
quality
of
beautiful
horror
for
years
afterwards
that
memory
stood
out
among
other
memories
as
something
peculiarly
strange
and
dreadful
day
followed
an
interminable
night
and
broke
slowly
things
crept
out
of
darkness
awoke
as
it
were
out
of
mysteries
and
reclothed
themselves
in
unsubstantial
shadows
and
forms
all
through
that
slow
infiltration
of
the
world
with
light
and
then
with
colour
the
universe
it
seemed
was
moaning
and
endeavouring
and
a
weak
and
terrible
struggle
went
on
and
kept
on
in
that
forbidden
room
whose
windows
opened
upon
the
lightening
world
dying
to
a
sobbing
silence
rising
again
to
agonizing
cries
fluctuating
a
perpetual
obstinate
failure
to
achieve
a
tormenting
end
he
went
out
and
behold
the
sky
was
a
wonder
of
pink
flushed
level
clouds
and
golden
hope
and
nearly
every
star
except
the
morning
star
had
gone
the
supine
moon
was
pale
and
in
blue
and
the
grass
which
had
been
grey
and
wet
was
green
again
and
the
bushes
and
trees
were
green
he
returned
and
hovered
in
the
passage
washed
his
face
listened
outside
the
door
for
moments
and
then
went
out
again
to
listen
under
the
window
he
went
to
his
room
and
shaved
sat
for
a
long
time
thinking
and
then
suddenly
knelt
by
his
bed
and
prayed
he
had
never
prayed
before
in
all
his
life
he
returned
to
the
garden
and
there
neglected
and
wet
with
dew
was
the
camp
chair
marjorie
had
sat
on
the
evening
before
the
shawl
she
had
been
wearing
the
novel
she
had
been
reading
he
brought
these
things
in
as
if
they
were
precious
treasures
light
was
pouring
into
the
world
again
now
he
noticed
with
an
extreme
particularity
the
detailed
dewy
delicacy
of
grass
and
twig
the
silver
edges
to
the
leaves
of
briar
and
nettle
the
soft
clearness
of
the
moss
on
bank
and
wall
he
noted
the
woods
with
the
first
warmth
of
autumn
tinting
their
green
the
clear
calm
sky
with
just
a
wisp
or
so
of
purple
cloud
waning
to
a
luminous
pink
on
the
brightening
east
the
exquisite
freshness
of
the
air
and
still
through
the
open
window
incessant
unbearable
came
this
sound
of
marjorie
moaning
now
dying
away
now
reviving
now
weakening
again
was
she
dying
were
they
murdering
her
it
was
incredible
this
torture
could
go
on
somehow
it
must
end
chiefly
he
wanted
to
go
in
and
kill
the
doctor
but
it
would
do
no
good
to
kill
the
doctor
at
last
the
nurse
came
out
looking
a
little
scared
to
ask
him
to
cycle
three
miles
away
and
borrow
some
special
sort
of
needle
that
the
fool
of
a
doctor
had
forgotten
he
went
outwardly
meek
and
returning
was
met
by
the
little
interested
servant
very
alert
and
excited
and
rather
superior
for
here
was
something
no
man
can
do
with
the
news
that
he
had
a
beautiful
little
daughter
and
that
all
was
well
with
marjorie
he
said
thank
god
thank
god
several
times
and
then
went
out
into
the
kitchen
and
began
to
eat
some
flabby
toast
and
drink
some
lukewarm
tea
he
found
there
he
was
horribly
fatigued
is
she
all
right
he
asked
over
his
shoulder
hearing
the
doctor
footsteps
on
the
stairs
they
were
very
pontifical
and
official
with
him
presently
they
brought
out
a
strange
wizened
little
animal
wailing
very
stoutly
with
a
face
like
a
very
very
old
woman
and
reddish
skin
and
hair
it
had
quite
a
lot
of
wet
blackish
hair
of
an
incredible
delicacy
of
texture
it
kicked
with
a
stumpy
monkey
legs
and
inturned
feet
he
held
it
his
heart
went
out
to
it
he
pitied
it
beyond
measure
it
was
so
weak
and
ugly
he
was
astonished
and
distressed
by
the
fact
of
its
extreme
endearing
ugliness
he
had
expected
something
strikingly
pretty
it
clenched
a
fist
and
he
perceived
it
had
all
its
complement
of
fingers
and
ridiculous
pretentious
little
finger
nails
inside
that
fist
it
squeezed
his
heart
he
did
not
want
to
give
it
back
to
them
he
wanted
to
protect
it
he
felt
they
could
not
understand
it
or
forgive
as
he
could
forgive
its
unjustifiable
feebleness
later
for
just
a
little
while
he
was
permitted
to
see
marjorie
marjorie
so
spent
so
unspeakably
weary
and
yet
so
reassuringly
vital
and
living
so
full
of
gentle
pride
and
gentler
courage
amidst
the
litter
of
surgical
precaution
that
the
tears
came
streaming
down
his
face
and
he
sobbed
shamelessly
as
he
kissed
her
little
daughter
she
whispered
and
smiled
just
as
she
had
always
smiled
that
sweet
dear
smile
of
hers
and
closed
her
eyes
and
said
no
more
afterwards
as
he
walked
up
and
down
the
garden
he
remembered
their
former
dispute
and
thought
how
characteristic
of
marjorie
it
was
to
have
a
daughter
in
spite
of
all
his
wishes
for
weeks
and
weeks
this
astonishing
and
unprecedented
being
filled
the
traffords
earth
and
sky
very
speedily
its
minute
quaintness
passed
and
it
became
a
vigorous
delightful
baby
that
was
as
the
nurse
explained
repeatedly
and
very
explicitly
not
only
quite
exceptional
and
distinguished
but
exactly
everything
that
a
baby
should
be
its
weight
became
of
supreme
importance
there
was
a
splendid
week
when
it
put
on
nine
ounces
and
an
indifferent
one
when
it
added
only
one
and
then
came
a
terrible
crisis
it
was
ill
some
sort
of
infection
had
reached
it
an
infantile
cholera
its
temperature
mounted
to
a
hundred
and
three
and
a
half
it
became
a
flushed
misery
wailing
with
a
pathetic
feeble
voice
then
it
ceased
to
wail
marjorie
became
and
from
want
of
sleep
and
it
seemed
to
trafford
that
perhaps
his
child
might
die
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
spirit
of
the
universe
must
be
a
monstrous
calivan
since
children
had
to
die
he
went
for
a
long
walk
through
the
october
beechwoods
under
a
windy
sky
and
in
a
drift
of
falling
leaves
wondering
with
a
renewed
freshness
at
the
haunting
futilities
of
life
life
was
not
futile
anything
but
that
but
futility
seemed
to
be
stalking
it
waiting
for
it
when
he
returned
the
child
was
already
better
and
in
a
few
days
it
was
well
again
but
very
light
and
thin
when
they
were
sure
of
its
safety
marjorie
and
he
confessed
the
extremity
of
their
fears
to
one
another
they
had
not
dared
to
speak
before
and
even
now
they
spoke
in
undertones
of
the
shadow
that
had
hovered
and
passed
over
the
dearest
thing
in
their
lives
chapter
the
third
the
new
phase
in
the
course
of
the
next
six
months
the
child
of
the
ages
became
an
almost
ordinary
healthy
baby
and
trafford
began
to
think
consecutively
about
his
scientific
work
again
in
the
intervals
of
effort
of
a
more
immediately
practical
sort
the
recall
of
molecular
physics
and
particularly
of
the
internal
condition
of
colloids
to
something
like
their
old
importance
in
his
life
was
greatly
accelerated
by
the
fact
that
a
young
oxford
don
named
behrens
was
showing
extraordinary
energy
in
what
had
been
for
a
time
trafford
distinctive
and
undisputed
field
behrens
was
one
of
those
vividly
clever
energetic
people
who
are
the
despair
of
originative
men
he
had
begun
as
trafford
pupil
and
sedulous
ape
he
had
gone
on
to
work
that
imitated
trafford
in
everything
except
its
continual
freshness
and
now
he
was
ransacking
every
scrap
of
suggestion
to
be
found
in
trafford
work
and
developing
it
with
an
intensity
of
uninspired
intelligence
that
most
marvellously
simulated
originality
he
was
already
being
noted
as
an
authority
sometimes
in
an
article
his
name
would
be
quoted
and
trafford
omitted
in
relation
to
ideas
and
in
every
way
his
emergence
and
the
manner
of
his
emergence
threatened
and
stimulated
his
model
and
master
a
great
effort
had
to
be
made
trafford
revived
the
drooping
spirits
of
durgan
by
a
renewed
punctuality
in
the
laboratory
he
began
to
stay
away
from
home
at
night
and
work
late
again
now
however
under
no
imperative
inspiration
but
simply
because
it
was
only
by
such
an
invasion
of
the
evening
and
night
that
it
would
be
possible
to
make
headway
against
behren
unremitting
industry
and
this
new
demand
upon
trafford
already
strained
mental
and
nervous
equipment
began
very
speedily
to
have
its
effect
upon
his
domestic
life
it
is
only
in
romantic
fiction
that
a
man
can
work
strenuously
to
the
limit
of
his
power
and
come
home
to
be
sweet
sunny
and
entertaining
trafford
preoccupation
involved
a
certain
negligence
of
marjorie
a
certain
indisposition
to
be
amused
or
interested
by
trifling
things
a
certain
irritability
and
now
indeed
the
traffords
were
coming
to
the
most
difficult
and
fatal
phase
in
marriage
they
had
had
that
taste
of
defiant
adventure
which
is
the
crown
of
a
spirited
love
affair
they
had
known
the
sweetness
of
a
maiden
passion
for
a
maid
and
they
had
felt
all
those
rich
and
solemn
emotions
those
splendid
fears
and
terrible
hopes
that
weave
themselves
about
the
great
partnership
in
parentage
and
now
so
far
as
sex
was
concerned
there
might
be
much
joy
and
delight
still
but
no
more
wonder
no
fresh
discoveries
of
incredible
new
worlds
and
unsuspected
stars
love
which
had
been
a
new
garden
an
unknown
land
a
sunlit
sea
to
launch
upon
was
now
a
rich
of
memories
and
memories
although
they
afford
a
perpetually
increasing
enrichment
to
emotion
are
not
sufficient
in
themselves
for
the
daily
needs
of
life
for
this
indeed
is
the
truth
of
passionate
love
that
it
works
outs
its
purpose
and
comes
to
an
end
a
day
arrives
in
every
marriage
when
the
lovers
must
face
each
other
disillusioned
stripped
of
the
last
shred
of
excitement
undisguisedly
themselves
and
our
two
were
married
they
had
bound
themselves
together
under
a
penalty
of
scandalous
disgrace
to
take
the
consequences
of
their
passionate
association
it
was
upon
trafford
that
this
exhaustion
of
the
sustaining
magic
of
love
pressed
most
severely
because
it
was
he
who
had
made
the
greatest
adaptations
to
the
exigencies
of
their
union
he
had
crippled
he
perceived
more
and
more
clearly
the
research
work
upon
which
his
whole
being
had
once
been
set
and
his
hours
were
full
of
tiresome
and
trivial
duties
and
his
mind
engaged
and
worried
by
growing
financial
anxieties
he
had
made
these
abandonments
in
a
phase
of
exalted
passion
for
the
one
woman
in
the
world
and
her
unprecedented
child
and
now
he
saw
in
spite
of
all
his
desire
not
to
see
that
she
was
just
a
weak
human
being
among
human
beings
and
neither
she
nor
little
margharita
so
very
marvellous
but
while
marjorie
shrank
to
the
dimensions
of
reality
research
remained
still
a
luminous
and
commanding
dream
in
love
one
fails
or
one
wins
home
but
the
lure
of
research
is
for
ever
beyond
the
hills
every
victory
is
a
new
desire
science
has
inexhaustibly
fresh
worlds
to
conquer
he
was
beginning
now
to
realize
the
dilemma
of
his
life
the
reality
of
the
opposition
between
marjorie
and
child
and
home
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
this
big
wider
thing
this
remoter
severer
demand
upon
his
being
he
had
long
perceived
these
were
distinct
and
different
things
but
now
it
appeared
more
and
more
inevitable
that
they
should
be
antagonistic
and
mutually
disregardful
things
each
claimed
him
altogether
it
seemed
and
suffered
compromise
impatiently
and
this
is
where
the
particular
stress
of
his
situation
came
in
hitherto
he
had
believed
that
nothing
of
any
importance
was
secret
or
inexplicable
between
himself
and
marjorie
his
ideal
of
his
relationship
had
assumed
a
complete
sympathy
of
feeling
an
almost
instinctive
identity
of
outlook
and
now
it
was
manifest
they
were
living
in
a
state
of
inadequate
understanding
that
she
knew
only
in
the
most
general
and
opaque
forms
the
things
that
interested
him
so
profoundly
and
had
but
the
most
superficial
interest
in
his
impassioned
curiosities
and
missing
as
she
did
the
strength
of
his
intellectual
purpose
she
missed
too
she
had
no
inkling
of
the
way
in
which
her
careless
expansiveness
pressed
upon
him
she
was
unaware
that
she
was
destroying
an
essential
thing
in
his
life
he
could
not
tell
how
far
this
antagonism
was
due
to
inalterable
discords
of
character
how
far
it
might
not
be
an
ineradicable
sex
difference
a
necessary
aspect
of
marriage
the
talk
of
old
sir
roderick
dover
at
the
winton
club
germinated
in
his
mind
a
branching
and
permeating
suggestion
and
then
would
come
a
phase
of
keen
sympathy
with
marjorie
she
would
say
brilliant
and
penetrating
things
display
a
swift
cleverness
that
drove
all
these
intimations
of
incurable
divergence
clean
out
of
his
head
again
then
he
would
find
explanations
in
the
differences
between
his
and
marjorie
training
and
early
associations
he
perceived
his
own
upbringing
had
had
a
steadfastness
and
consistency
that
had
been
altogether
lacking
in
hers
he
had
had
the
rare
advantage
of
perfect
honesty
in
the
teaching
and
tradition
of
his
home
there
had
never
been
any
shams
or
sentimentalities
for
him
to
find
out
and
abandon
from
boyhood
his
mother
hand
had
pointed
steadily
to
the
search
for
truth
as
the
supreme
ennobling
fact
in
life
she
had
never
preached
this
to
him
never
delivered
discourses
upon
his
virtues
but
all
her
conversation
and
life
was
saturated
with
this
idea
compared
with
this
atmosphere
of
high
and
sustained
direction
the
intellectual
and
moral
quality
of
the
popes
he
saw
was
the
quality
of
an
agitated
rag
bag
they
had
thought
nothing
out
joined
nothing
together
they
seemed
to
believe
everything
and
nothing
they
were
neither
religious
nor
irreligious
neither
moral
nor
adventurous
in
the
place
of
a
religion
and
tainting
their
entire
atmosphere
they
had
the
decaying
remains
of
a
dead
anglicanism
it
was
clear
they
did
not
believe
in
its
creed
and
as
clear
that
they
did
not
want
to
get
rid
of
it
it
afforded
them
no
guidance
but
only
vague
pretensions
and
the
dismal
exercises
of
silas
root
flourished
in
its
shadows
a
fungus
a
activity
of
the
soul
none
of
them
had
any
idea
of
what
they
were
for
or
what
their
lives
as
a
whole
might
mean
they
had
no
standards
but
only
instincts
and
an
instinctive
fear
of
instincts
pope
wanted
to
be
tremendously
respected
and
complimented
by
everybody
and
get
six
per
cent
for
his
money
pope
wanted
things
to
go
smoothly
the
young
people
had
a
general
indisposition
to
do
anything
that
might
look
bad
and
otherwise
have
a
good
time
but
neither
marjorie
nor
any
of
them
had
any
test
for
a
good
time
and
so
they
fluctuated
in
their
conceptions
of
what
they
wanted
from
day
to
day
now
it
was
plessingtonian
standards
now
carmel
standards
now
the
standards
of
agatha
alimony
now
it
was
a
stimulating
novel
now
a
gleam
of
æsthetic
imaginativeness
come
heaven
knows
whence
that
dominated
her
mood
he
was
beginning
to
understand
all
this
at
last
and
to
see
the
need
of
coherence
in
marjorie
mood
he
realized
the
unfairness
of
keeping
his
thoughts
to
himself
the
need
of
putting
his
case
before
her
and
making
her
realize
their
fatal
and
widening
divergence
he
wanted
to
infect
her
with
his
scientific
passion
to
give
her
his
sense
of
the
gravity
of
their
practical
difficulties
he
would
sit
amidst
his
neglected
work
in
his
laboratory
framing
explanatory
phrases
he
would
prepare
the
most
lucid
and
complete
statements
and
go
about
with
these
in
his
mind
for
days
waiting
for
an
opportunity
of
saying
what
he
felt
so
urgently
had
to
be
said
but
the
things
that
seemed
so
luminous
and
effective
in
the
laboratory
had
a
curious
way
of
fading
and
shrinking
beside
the
bright
colours
of
marjorie
bokhara
hangings
in
the
presence
of
little
margharita
pink
and
warm
and
entertaining
in
her
bath
or
amidst
the
fluttering
rustle
of
the
afternoon
that
were
now
becoming
frequent
in
his
house
and
when
he
was
alone
with
her
he
discovered
they
did
talk
now
any
more
except
in
terms
of
a
constrained
and
formal
affection
what
had
happened
to
them
what
was
the
matter
between
himself
and
marjorie
that
he
could
even
intimate
his
sense
of
their
divergence
he
would
have
liked
to
discuss
the
whole
thing
with
his
mother
but
somehow
that
seemed
disloyal
to
marjorie
one
day
they
quarrelled
he
came
in
about
six
in
the
afternoon
jaded
from
the
delivery
of
a
suburban
lecture
and
the
consequent
tedium
of
suburban
travel
and
discovered
marjorie
examining
the
effect
of
a
new
picture
which
had
replaced
the
german
print
of
sunlit
waves
over
the
mantelpiece
it
was
a
painting
in
the
manner
and
it
had
arrived
after
the
close
of
the
exhibition
in
weldon
street
at
which
marjorie
had
bought
it
she
had
bought
it
in
obedience
to
a
sudden
impulse
and
its
imminence
had
long
weighed
upon
her
conscience
she
had
gone
to
the
show
with
sydney
flor
and
old
flor
sydney
mother
and
a
kind
of
excitement
had
come
upon
them
at
the
idea
of
possessing
this
particular
picture
flor
had
already
bought
three
herbins
and
her
daughter
wanted
to
dissuade
her
from
more
but
they
so
delightful
said
flor
you
overrunning
your
allowance
said
sydney
disputing
the
point
they
made
inquiries
for
the
price
and
learnt
that
this
bright
epigram
in
colour
was
going
begging
was
even
offered
at
a
reduction
from
the
catalogue
price
a
reduced
price
always
had
a
strong
appeal
nowadays
to
marjorie
mind
if
you
do
get
it
she
said
abruptly
i
shall
the
transition
from
that
attitude
to
ownership
was
amazingly
rapid
then
nothing
remained
but
to
wait
for
the
picture
she
had
dreaded
a
mistake
a
blundering
discord
but
now
with
the
thing
hung
she
could
see
her
quick
eye
had
not
betrayed
her
it
was
a
mass
of
reds
browns
purples
and
vivid
greens
and
greys
an
effect
of
roof
and
brick
house
facing
upon
a
dutch
canal
and
it
lit
up
the
room
and
was
echoed
and
reflected
by
all
the
rest
of
her
courageous
colour
scheme
like
a
amidst
mahogany
and
metal
it
justified
itself
to
her
completely
and
she
faced
her
husband
with
a
certain
confidence
hullo
he
cried
a
new
picture
she
said
what
do
you
think
of
it
what
is
it
a
town
or
something
never
mind
look
at
the
colour
it
heartens
everything
trafford
looked
at
the
painting
with
a
reluctant
admiration
it
brilliant
and
impudent
he
an
artist
whoever
he
is
he
hits
the
thing
but
i
say
how
did
you
get
it
i
bought
it
bought
it
good
lord
how
much
oh
ten
guineas
said
marjorie
with
an
affectation
of
ease
it
will
be
worth
thirty
in
ten
years
time
trafford
reply
was
to
repeat
ten
guineas
their
eyes
met
and
there
was
singularly
little
tenderness
in
their
eyes
it
was
priced
at
thirteen
said
marjorie
ending
a
pause
and
with
a
sinking
heart
trafford
had
left
her
side
he
walked
to
the
window
and
sat
down
in
a
chair
i
think
this
is
too
much
he
said
and
his
voice
had
disagreeable
notes
in
it
she
had
never
heard
before
i
have
just
been
earning
two
guineas
at
croydon
of
all
places
administering
comminuted
science
to
fools
and
here
i
find
this
exploit
ten
guineas
worth
of
picture
to
say
we
ca
afford
it
is
just
to
waste
a
mild
expression
it
mad
extravagance
it
waste
of
money
it
oh
monstrous
disloyalty
disloyalty
he
stared
resentful
at
the
cheerful
unhesitating
daubs
of
the
picture
for
a
moment
its
affected
carelessness
goaded
him
to
fresh
words
he
spoke
in
a
tone
of
absolute
hostility
i
think
this
winds
me
up
to
something
he
said
you
have
to
give
up
your
marjorie
give
up
my
he
looked
up
at
her
and
nodded
there
was
a
warm
flush
in
her
cheeks
her
lips
panted
apart
and
tears
of
disappointment
and
vexation
were
shining
beautifully
in
her
eyes
she
mingled
the
quality
of
an
indignant
woman
with
the
distress
and
unreasonable
resentment
of
a
child
because
i
bought
this
picture
can
we
go
on
like
this
he
asked
and
felt
how
miserably
he
had
bungled
in
opening
this
question
that
had
been
in
his
mind
so
long
but
it
she
said
he
disregarded
that
he
felt
now
that
he
had
to
go
on
with
these
expostulations
he
was
tired
and
dusty
from
his
carriage
his
spirit
was
tired
and
dusty
and
he
said
what
he
had
to
say
without
either
breadth
or
power
an
undignified
statement
of
personal
grievances
a
mere
complaint
of
the
burthen
of
work
that
falls
upon
a
man
that
she
missed
the
high
aim
in
him
and
all
sense
of
the
greatness
they
were
losing
had
vanished
from
his
thoughts
he
had
too
heavy
a
share
of
the
common
burthen
and
she
pressed
upon
him
unthinkingly
that
was
all
he
could
say
he
girded
at
her
with
a
bitter
and
loveless
truth
it
was
none
the
less
cruel
that
in
her
heart
she
knew
these
things
he
said
were
true
but
he
went
beyond
justice
as
every
quarrelling
human
being
does
he
called
the
things
she
had
bought
and
the
harmonies
she
had
created
this
litter
and
rubbish
for
which
i
am
wasting
my
life
that
stabbed
into
her
pride
acutely
and
deeply
she
knew
anyhow
that
it
was
so
simple
and
crude
as
that
it
was
not
mere
witlessness
she
contributed
to
their
trouble
she
tried
to
indicate
her
sense
of
that
but
she
had
no
power
of
ordered
reasoning
she
made
futile
interruptions
she
was
inexpressive
of
anything
but
emotion
she
felt
gagged
against
his
flow
of
indignant
hostile
words
they
blistered
her
suddenly
she
went
to
her
little
desk
in
the
corner
unlocked
it
with
trembling
hands
snatched
her
out
of
a
heap
of
still
unsettled
bills
and
having
locked
that
safe
away
again
turned
upon
him
here
it
is
she
said
and
stood
poised
for
a
moment
then
she
flung
down
the
little
narrow
grey
cover
nearly
empty
it
was
of
cheques
on
the
floor
before
him
take
it
she
cried
take
it
i
never
asked
you
to
give
it
me
a
memory
of
orta
and
its
reeds
and
sunshine
and
love
rose
like
a
luminous
mist
between
them
she
ran
weeping
from
the
room
he
leapt
to
his
feet
as
the
door
closed
marjorie
he
cried
but
she
did
not
hear
him
the
disillusionment
about
marriage
which
had
discovered
trafford
a
thwarted
overworked
and
worried
man
had
revealed
marjorie
with
time
on
her
hands
superabundant
imaginative
energy
and
no
clear
intimation
of
any
occupation
with
them
as
with
thousands
of
young
couples
in
london
the
breadwinner
was
overworked
and
the
spending
partner
duty
was
chiefly
the
negative
one
of
not
spending
you
can
not
consume
your
energies
merely
in
not
spending
money
do
what
she
could
marjorie
could
not
contrive
to
make
house
and
child
fill
the
waking
hours
she
was
far
too
active
and
irritable
a
being
to
be
beneficial
company
all
day
for
genial
little
margharita
she
could
play
with
that
young
lady
and
lead
her
into
ecstasies
of
excitement
and
delight
and
she
could
see
with
an
almost
instinctive
certainty
when
anything
was
going
wrong
but
for
the
rest
that
little
life
reposed
far
more
beneficially
upon
the
passive
acquiescence
of
may
her
pink
and
wholesome
nurse
and
the
household
generally
was
in
the
hands
of
a
trustworthy
who
maintained
a
tolerable
routine
marjorie
did
not
dare
to
have
an
idea
about
food
or
domestic
arrangements
if
she
touched
that
routine
so
much
as
with
her
little
finger
it
sent
up
the
bills
she
could
knock
off
butcher
and
greengrocer
and
do
every
scrap
of
household
work
that
she
could
touch
in
a
couple
of
hours
a
day
she
tried
to
find
some
work
to
fill
her
leisure
she
suggested
to
trafford
that
she
might
help
him
by
writing
up
his
science
notes
from
rough
pencil
memoranda
but
when
it
became
clear
that
the
first
step
to
her
doing
this
would
be
the
purchase
of
a
remington
typewriter
and
a
special
low
table
to
carry
it
he
became
bluntly
discouraging
she
thought
of
literary
work
and
sat
down
one
day
to
write
a
short
story
and
earn
guineas
and
was
surprised
to
find
that
she
knew
nothing
of
any
sort
of
human
being
about
whom
she
could
invent
a
story
she
tried
a
cheap
subscription
at
mudie
and
novels
and
they
filled
her
with
a
thirst
for
events
she
tried
needlework
and
found
her
best
efforts
aesthetically
feeble
and
despicable
and
that
her
mind
prowled
above
the
silks
and
colours
like
a
hungry
wolf
the
early
afternoons
were
the
worst
time
from
two
to
four
before
calling
began
the
devil
was
given
great
power
over
marjorie
early
afternoon
she
could
even
envy
her
former
home
life
then
and
reflect
that
there
at
any
rate
one
had
a
chance
of
a
game
or
a
quarrel
with
daffy
or
syd
or
rom
or
theodore
she
would
pull
herself
together
and
go
out
for
a
walk
and
whichever
way
she
went
there
were
shops
and
shops
and
shops
a
glittering
array
of
tempting
opportunities
for
spending
money
sometimes
she
would
give
way
to
spending
exactly
as
a
struggling
drunkard
decides
to
tipple
she
would
fix
on
some
object
some
object
trivial
and
a
little
rare
and
not
too
costly
as
being
needed
when
she
knew
perfectly
well
it
was
needed
and
choose
the
most
remotest
shops
and
display
the
exactest
insistence
upon
her
requirements
sometimes
she
would
get
home
from
these
raids
without
buying
at
all
after
four
the
worst
of
the
day
was
over
one
could
call
on
people
or
people
might
telephone
and
follow
up
with
a
call
and
there
was
a
chance
of
trafford
coming
home
one
day
at
the
carmels
she
found
herself
engaged
in
a
vigorous
flirtation
with
young
carmel
she
had
noticed
it
coming
on
but
there
she
was
in
a
windowseat
talking
quite
closely
to
him
he
said
he
was
writing
a
play
a
wonderful
passionate
play
about
francis
and
only
she
could
inspire
and
advise
him
was
there
some
afternoon
in
the
week
when
she
sat
and
sewed
so
that
he
might
come
and
sit
by
her
and
read
to
her
and
talk
to
her
he
made
his
request
with
a
certain
confidence
but
it
filled
her
with
a
righteous
panic
she
pulled
him
up
with
an
abruptness
that
was
almost
inartistic
on
her
way
home
she
was
acutely
ashamed
of
herself
this
was
the
first
time
she
had
let
any
man
but
trafford
think
he
might
be
interesting
to
her
but
once
or
twice
on
former
occasions
she
had
been
on
the
verge
of
such
provocative
intimations
this
sort
of
thing
anyhow
must
happen
but
if
she
did
dress
with
any
distinction
because
of
the
cost
and
did
flirt
and
trail
men
in
her
wake
what
was
she
to
do
at
the
afternoon
gatherings
which
were
now
her
chief
form
of
social
contact
what
was
going
to
bring
people
to
her
house
she
knew
that
she
was
more
than
ordinarily
beautiful
and
that
she
could
talk
well
but
that
does
not
count
for
much
if
you
are
rather
dowdy
and
quite
uneventfully
virtuous
it
became
the
refrain
of
all
her
thoughts
that
she
must
find
something
to
do
there
remained
movements
she
might
take
up
a
movement
she
was
a
rather
exceptionally
good
public
speaker
only
her
elopement
and
marriage
had
prevented
her
being
president
of
her
college
debating
society
if
she
devoted
herself
to
some
movement
she
would
be
free
to
devise
an
ostentatiously
simple
dress
for
herself
and
stick
to
it
and
she
would
be
able
to
give
her
little
house
a
significance
of
her
own
and
present
herself
publicly
against
what
is
perhaps
quite
the
best
of
all
backgrounds
for
a
woman
a
platform
yes
she
had
to
go
in
for
a
movement
she
reviewed
the
chief
contemporary
movements
much
as
she
might
have
turned
over
dress
fabrics
in
a
draper
shop
weighing
the
advantages
and
disadvantages
of
each
london
of
course
is
always
full
of
movements
essentially
they
are
absorbents
of
superfluous
feminine
energy
they
have
a
common
flavour
of
progress
and
revolutionary
purpose
and
common
features
in
abundant
meetings
officials
and
organization
generally
few
are
expensive
and
still
fewer
produce
any
tangible
results
in
the
world
they
direct
themselves
at
the
most
various
ends
the
poor
that
favourite
butt
either
as
a
whole
or
in
such
typical
sections
as
the
indigent
invalid
or
the
indigent
aged
the
young
public
health
the
woman
cause
the
prevention
of
animal
food
the
gratuitous
advertisement
of
shakespear
that
neglected
poet
novel
but
genteel
modifications
of
medical
or
religious
practice
dress
reform
the
politer
aspects
of
socialism
the
encouragement
of
æronautics
universal
military
service
garden
suburbs
domestic
arts
proportional
representation
duodecimal
arithmetic
and
the
liberation
of
the
drama
they
range
in
size
and
importance
from
campaigns
on
a
plessingtonian
scale
to
sober
little
intellectual
beckingham
things
that
arrange
to
meet
and
die
quietly
before
the
second
assembly
if
heaven
by
some
miracle
suddenly
gave
every
movement
in
london
all
it
professed
to
want
our
world
would
be
standing
on
its
head
and
everything
would
be
extremely
unfamiliar
and
disconcerting
but
as
roosevelt
once
remarked
the
justifying
thing
about
life
is
the
effort
and
not
the
goal
and
few
movements
involve
any
real
and
impassioned
struggle
to
get
to
the
ostensible
object
they
exist
as
an
occupation
they
exercise
the
intellectual
and
moral
activities
without
undue
disturbance
of
the
normal
routines
of
life
in
the
days
when
everybody
was
bicycling
an
ingenious
mechanism
called
hacker
home
bicycle
used
to
be
advertised
hacker
home
bicycle
was
a
stand
bearing
small
rubber
wheels
upon
which
one
placed
one
bicycle
properly
equipped
with
a
cyclometer
in
such
a
way
that
it
could
be
mounted
and
ridden
without
any
sensible
forward
movement
whatever
in
bad
weather
or
when
the
state
of
the
roads
made
cycling
abroad
disagreeable
hacker
home
bicycle
could
be
placed
in
front
of
an
open
window
and
ridden
furiously
for
any
length
of
time
whenever
the
rider
tired
he
could
descend
comfortably
at
home
again
and
examine
the
cyclometer
to
see
how
far
he
had
been
in
exactly
the
same
way
the
ordinary
london
movement
gives
scope
for
the
restless
and
progressive
impulse
in
human
nature
without
the
risk
of
personal
entanglements
or
any
inconvenient
disturbance
of
the
milieu
marjorie
considered
the
movements
about
her
she
surveyed
the
accessible
aspects
of
socialism
but
that
old
of
constructive
suggestion
had
an
effect
like
a
rich
château
which
had
been
stormed
and
looted
by
a
mob
for
a
time
the
proposition
that
we
are
all
socialists
nowadays
had
prevailed
the
blackened
and
discredited
frame
remained
the
contents
were
scattered
aunt
plessington
had
a
few
pieces
the
tory
democrats
had
taken
freely
the
liberals
were
in
possession
of
a
hastily
compiled
collection
there
was
she
perceived
and
there
never
had
been
a
socialist
movement
the
socialist
idea
which
had
now
become
part
of
the
general
consciousness
had
always
been
too
big
for
polite
domestication
she
weighed
aunt
plessington
too
in
the
balance
and
found
her
not
so
much
wanting
indeed
as
excessive
she
felt
that
a
movement
with
aunt
plessington
in
it
could
possibly
offer
even
for
anybody
else
philanthropy
generally
she
shunned
the
movements
that
aim
at
getting
poor
people
into
rooms
and
shouting
at
them
in
an
improving
authoritative
way
aroused
an
instinctive
dislike
in
her
her
sense
of
humour
again
would
not
let
her
patronize
shakespear
or
the
stage
or
raise
the
artistic
level
of
the
country
by
means
of
deal
and
the
influence
of
trafford
on
her
mind
debarred
her
from
attempting
the
physical
and
moral
regeneration
of
humanity
by
means
of
beans
and
nut
butter
it
was
indeed
rather
by
the
elimination
of
competing
movements
than
by
any
positive
preference
that
she
found
herself
declining
at
last
towards
agatha
alimony
section
of
the
suffrage
movement
it
was
one
of
the
less
militant
sections
but
it
held
more
meetings
and
passed
more
resolutions
than
any
two
others
one
day
trafford
returning
from
an
afternoon
of
forced
and
disappointing
work
in
his
laboratory
his
mind
had
been
steadfastly
sluggish
and
inelastic
discovered
marjorie
dining
room
crowded
with
hats
and
all
the
rustle
and
colour
which
plays
so
large
a
part
in
constituting
contemporary
feminine
personality
buzard
the
feminist
writer
and
a
young
man
just
down
from
cambridge
who
had
written
a
decadent
poem
were
the
only
men
present
the
chairs
were
arranged
but
a
little
irregularly
to
suggest
informality
the
picture
was
a
rosy
benediction
on
the
gathering
and
at
a
table
in
the
window
sat
pope
in
the
chair
looking
quietly
tactful
in
an
unusually
becoming
bonnet
supported
by
her
daughter
and
agatha
alimony
marjorie
was
in
a
simple
gown
of
hatless
amidst
a
froth
of
foolish
bows
and
feathers
and
she
looked
not
only
beautiful
and
dignified
but
deliberately
and
conscientiously
patient
until
she
perceived
the
new
arrival
then
he
noted
she
was
a
little
concerned
for
him
and
made
some
futile
sign
he
did
not
comprehend
the
meeting
was
debating
the
behaviour
of
women
at
the
approaching
census
and
a
small
earnest
lady
with
glasses
was
standing
against
the
fireplace
with
a
crumpled
envelope
covered
with
pencil
notes
in
her
hand
and
making
a
speech
trafford
wanted
his
tea
badly
but
he
had
not
the
wit
to
realize
that
his
study
had
been
converted
into
a
refreshment
room
for
the
occasion
he
hesitated
and
seated
himself
near
the
doorway
and
so
he
was
caught
he
could
he
felt
get
away
and
seem
to
slight
a
woman
who
was
giving
herself
the
pains
of
addressing
him
the
small
lady
in
glasses
was
giving
a
fancy
picture
of
the
mind
of
asquith
and
its
attitude
to
the
suffrage
movement
and
telling
with
a
sort
of
inspired
intimacy
just
how
asquith
had
hoped
to
bully
women
down
and
just
how
their
various
attempts
to
bring
home
to
him
the
eminent
reasonableness
of
their
sex
by
breaking
his
windows
interrupting
his
meetings
booing
at
him
in
the
streets
and
threatening
his
life
had
time
after
time
baffled
this
arrogant
hope
there
had
been
many
signs
lately
that
asquith
heart
was
failing
him
now
here
was
a
new
thing
to
fill
him
with
despair
when
asquith
learnt
that
women
refused
to
be
counted
in
the
census
then
at
least
she
was
convinced
he
must
give
in
when
he
gave
in
it
would
not
be
long
she
had
her
information
upon
good
authority
before
they
got
the
vote
so
what
they
had
to
do
was
not
to
be
counted
in
the
census
that
was
their
paramount
duty
at
the
present
time
the
women
of
england
had
to
say
quietly
but
firmly
to
the
census
man
when
he
came
round
no
we
do
count
in
an
election
and
we
wo
count
now
thank
you
no
one
could
force
a
woman
to
fill
in
a
census
paper
she
did
want
to
and
for
her
own
part
said
the
little
woman
with
the
glasses
she
starve
first
applause
for
her
own
part
she
was
a
householder
with
a
census
paper
of
her
own
and
across
that
she
was
going
to
write
quite
plainly
and
simply
what
she
thought
of
asquith
some
of
those
present
would
have
census
papers
to
fill
up
they
would
be
sent
to
the
man
the
head
of
the
house
but
the
had
foreseen
that
each
householder
had
to
write
down
the
particulars
of
the
people
who
slept
in
his
house
on
sunday
night
or
who
arrived
home
before
on
monday
the
reply
of
the
women
of
england
must
be
not
to
sleep
in
a
house
that
night
where
census
papers
were
properly
filled
and
not
to
go
home
until
the
following
afternoon
all
through
that
night
the
women
of
england
must
be
abroad
she
herself
was
prepared
and
her
house
would
be
ready
there
would
be
coffee
and
refreshments
enough
for
an
unlimited
number
of
refugees
there
would
be
twenty
or
thirty
sofas
and
mattresses
and
piles
of
blankets
for
those
who
chose
to
sleep
safe
from
all
counting
in
every
quarter
of
london
there
would
be
houses
of
refuge
like
hers
and
so
they
would
make
asquith
census
fail
as
it
deserved
to
fail
as
every
census
would
fail
until
women
managed
these
affairs
in
a
sensible
way
for
she
supposed
they
were
all
agreed
that
only
women
could
manage
these
things
in
a
sensible
way
that
was
contribution
to
this
great
and
important
question
applause
amidst
which
the
small
lady
with
the
glasses
resumed
her
seat
trafford
glanced
doorward
but
before
he
could
move
another
speaker
was
in
possession
of
the
room
this
was
a
very
young
tall
fair
girl
who
held
herself
with
an
unnatural
rigidity
fixed
her
eyes
on
the
floor
just
in
front
of
the
chairwoman
and
spoke
with
knitted
brows
and
an
effect
of
extreme
strain
she
remarked
that
some
people
did
not
approve
of
this
proposed
boycott
of
the
census
she
hung
silent
for
a
moment
as
if
ransacking
her
mind
for
something
mislaid
and
then
proceeded
to
remark
that
she
proposed
to
occupy
a
few
moments
in
answering
that
objection
if
it
could
be
called
an
objection
they
said
that
spoiling
the
census
was
an
illegitimate
extension
of
the
woman
movement
well
she
objected
she
objected
fiercely
to
every
word
of
that
phrase
nothing
was
an
illegitimate
extension
of
the
woman
movement
nothing
could
be
applause
that
was
the
very
principle
they
had
been
fighting
for
all
along
so
that
examined
in
this
way
this
objection
resolved
itself
into
a
mere
question
begging
phrase
nothing
more
and
her
reply
therefore
to
those
who
made
it
was
that
they
were
begging
the
question
and
however
well
that
might
do
for
men
it
would
certainly
not
do
they
would
find
for
women
applause
for
the
freshly
awakened
consciousness
of
women
further
applause
this
was
a
war
in
which
quarter
was
neither
asked
nor
given
if
it
were
not
so
things
might
be
different
she
remained
silent
after
that
for
the
space
of
twenty
seconds
perhaps
and
then
remarked
that
that
seemed
to
be
all
she
had
to
say
and
sat
down
amidst
loud
encouragement
then
with
a
certain
dismay
trafford
saw
his
wife
upon
her
feet
he
was
afraid
of
the
effect
upon
himself
of
what
she
was
going
to
say
but
he
need
have
had
no
reason
for
his
fear
marjorie
was
a
seasoned
debater
with
a
voice
very
well
controlled
and
a
complete
mastery
of
that
elaborate
appearance
of
reasonableness
which
is
so
essential
to
good
public
speaking
she
could
speak
far
better
than
she
could
talk
and
she
startled
the
meeting
in
her
opening
sentence
by
declaring
that
she
meant
to
stay
at
home
on
the
census
night
and
supply
her
husband
with
every
scrap
of
information
he
had
got
already
that
might
be
needed
to
make
the
return
an
entirely
perfect
return
marked
absence
of
applause
she
proceeded
to
avow
her
passionate
interest
in
the
feminist
movement
of
which
this
agitation
for
the
vote
was
merely
the
symbol
a
voice
no
no
one
could
be
more
aware
of
the
falsity
of
woman
position
at
the
present
time
than
she
was
she
seemed
to
be
speaking
right
across
the
room
to
trafford
they
were
neither
pets
nor
partners
but
something
between
the
two
now
indulged
like
spoilt
children
now
blamed
like
defaulting
partners
constantly
provoked
to
use
the
arts
of
their
sex
constantly
mischievous
because
of
that
provocation
she
caught
her
breath
and
stopped
for
a
moment
as
if
she
had
suddenly
remembered
the
meeting
intervening
between
herself
and
trafford
no
she
said
there
was
no
more
ardent
feminist
and
suffragist
than
herself
in
the
room
she
wanted
the
vote
and
everything
it
implied
with
all
her
heart
with
all
her
heart
but
every
way
to
get
a
thing
was
the
right
way
and
she
felt
with
every
fibre
of
her
being
that
this
petulant
hostility
to
the
census
was
a
wrong
way
and
an
inconsistent
way
and
likely
to
be
an
unsuccessful
way
one
that
would
lose
them
the
sympathy
and
help
of
just
that
class
of
men
they
should
look
to
for
support
the
cultivated
and
scientific
men
a
voice
we
want
them
what
was
the
commonest
charge
made
by
the
man
in
the
street
against
women
that
they
were
unreasonable
and
unmanageable
that
it
was
their
way
to
get
things
by
crying
and
making
an
irrelevant
fuss
and
here
they
were
as
a
body
doing
that
very
thing
let
them
think
what
the
census
and
all
that
modern
organization
of
vital
statistics
of
which
it
was
the
central
feature
stood
for
it
stood
for
order
for
the
replacement
of
guesses
and
emotional
generalization
by
a
clear
knowledge
of
facts
for
the
replacement
of
instinctive
and
violent
methods
by
which
women
had
everything
to
lose
a
voice
no
by
reason
and
knowledge
and
by
which
women
had
everything
to
gain
to
her
the
advancement
of
science
the
progress
of
civilization
and
the
emancipation
of
womanhood
were
nearly
synonymous
terms
at
any
rate
they
were
different
phases
of
one
thing
they
were
different
aspects
of
one
wider
purpose
when
they
struck
at
the
census
she
felt
they
struck
at
themselves
she
glanced
at
trafford
as
if
she
would
convince
him
that
this
was
the
real
voice
of
the
suffrage
movement
and
sat
down
amidst
a
brief
polite
applause
that
warmed
to
rapture
as
agatha
alimony
the
stirring
agatha
rose
to
reply
miss
alimony
who
was
wearing
an
enormous
hat
with
three
nodding
ostrich
feathers
a
purple
bow
a
gold
buckle
and
numerous
minor
ornaments
of
various
origin
and
substance
said
they
had
all
of
them
listened
with
the
greatest
appreciation
and
sympathy
to
the
speech
of
their
hostess
their
hostess
was
a
newcomer
to
the
movement
she
knew
she
might
say
this
without
offence
and
was
passing
through
a
phase
an
early
phase
through
which
many
of
them
had
passed
this
was
the
phase
of
trying
to
take
a
reasonable
view
of
an
unreasonable
situation
applause
their
hostess
had
spoken
of
science
and
no
doubt
science
was
a
great
thing
but
there
was
something
greater
than
science
and
that
was
the
ideal
it
was
woman
place
to
idealize
sooner
or
later
their
hostess
would
discover
as
they
had
all
discovered
that
it
was
not
to
science
but
the
ideal
that
women
must
look
for
freedom
consider
she
said
the
scientific
men
of
consider
for
example
sir
james
the
physiologist
was
he
on
their
side
on
the
contrary
he
said
the
most
unpleasant
things
about
them
on
every
occasion
he
went
out
of
his
way
to
say
them
or
consider
sir
almroth
wright
did
he
speak
well
of
women
or
sir
ray
lankester
the
biologist
who
was
the
chief
ornament
of
the
society
or
sir
roderick
dover
the
physicist
who
forgetting
madame
curie
a
far
more
celebrated
physicist
than
himself
she
ventured
to
say
applause
had
recently
gone
outside
his
province
altogether
to
abuse
feminine
research
there
were
your
scientific
men
trafford
had
said
their
campaign
would
annoy
scientific
men
well
under
the
circumstances
she
wanted
to
annoy
scientific
men
applause
she
wanted
to
annoy
everybody
until
women
got
the
vote
loud
applause
the
more
annoying
they
were
the
better
when
the
whole
world
was
impressed
by
the
idea
that
voteless
women
were
an
intolerable
nuisance
then
there
would
cease
to
be
voteless
women
enthusiasm
asquith
had
said
and
so
on
for
quite
a
long
time
buzard
rose
out
of
waves
of
subsiding
emotion
buzard
was
a
slender
man
with
gilt
glasses
uneasy
movements
and
a
hypersensitive
manner
he
did
so
much
speak
as
thrill
with
thought
vibrations
he
spoke
like
an
entranced
but
still
quite
gentlemanly
sibyl
after
agatha
deep
trumpet
calls
he
sounded
like
a
solo
on
the
piccolo
he
picked
out
all
his
more
important
words
with
a
little
stress
as
though
he
gave
them
capitals
he
said
their
hostess
remarks
had
set
him
thinking
he
thought
it
was
possible
to
stew
the
scientific
argument
in
its
own
juice
there
was
something
he
might
call
the
factuarial
estimate
of
values
well
it
was
a
high
factuarial
value
on
their
side
in
his
opinion
at
any
rate
when
anthropologists
came
and
told
him
that
the
primitive
human
society
was
a
matriarchate
but
it
was
said
trafford
to
himself
it
had
a
high
factuarial
value
when
they
assured
him
that
every
one
of
the
great
primitive
inventions
was
made
by
a
woman
and
that
it
was
to
women
they
owed
fire
and
the
early
epics
and
sagas
good
lord
said
trafford
it
had
a
high
factuarial
value
when
they
not
only
asserted
but
proved
that
for
thousands
of
years
and
perhaps
for
hundreds
of
thousands
of
years
women
had
been
in
possession
of
articulate
speech
before
men
rose
to
that
level
of
intelligence
it
occurred
suddenly
to
trafford
that
he
could
go
now
that
it
would
be
better
to
go
that
indeed
he
go
it
was
no
doubt
necessary
that
his
mind
should
have
to
work
in
the
same
world
as
buzard
mental
processes
but
at
any
rate
those
two
sets
of
unsympathetic
functions
need
not
go
on
in
the
same
room
something
might
give
way
he
got
up
and
with
those
elaborate
efforts
to
be
silent
that
lead
to
the
violent
upsetting
of
chairs
got
himself
out
of
the
room
and
into
the
passage
and
was
at
once
rescued
by
the
sympathetic
in
her
most
generalized
form
and
given
fresh
tea
in
his
study
which
impressed
him
as
being
catastrophically
disarranged
when
marjorie
was
at
last
alone
with
him
she
found
him
in
a
state
of
extreme
mental
stimulation
your
speech
he
said
was
all
right
i
did
know
you
could
speak
like
that
marjorie
but
it
soared
like
the
dove
above
the
waters
waters
i
never
heard
such
a
flood
of
rubbish
you
know
it
a
mistake
to
women
it
brings
out
something
silly
it
affected
buzard
as
badly
as
any
one
the
extraordinary
thing
is
they
have
a
case
if
only
they
be
quiet
why
did
you
get
them
together
it
our
local
branch
yes
but
well
if
they
talk
about
things
discussions
like
this
clear
up
their
minds
discussion
it
was
discussion
oh
it
was
a
beginning
chatter
of
that
sort
is
the
beginning
of
discussion
it
the
end
it
the
nobody
was
meeting
the
thoughts
of
any
one
i
admit
buzard
who
a
man
talked
the
worst
rubbish
of
all
that
primitive
matriarchate
of
his
so
it
is
sex
i
noticed
before
that
the
men
in
this
movement
of
yours
are
worse
than
the
women
it
sex
it
something
else
it
a
foolishness
it
a
sort
of
irresponsible
looseness
he
turned
on
her
gravely
you
ought
not
to
get
all
these
people
here
it
contagious
before
you
know
it
find
your
own
mind
liquefy
and
become
enthusiastic
and
slop
about
you
begin
to
talk
monomania
about
mr
asquith
but
it
a
great
movement
rag
even
if
incidentally
they
say
and
do
silly
things
my
dear
are
i
feminist
do
i
want
women
fine
and
sane
and
responsible
do
i
want
them
to
have
education
to
handle
things
to
vote
like
men
and
bear
themselves
with
the
gravity
of
men
and
these
meetings
all
hat
and
flutter
these
displays
of
weak
untrained
hysterical
vehemence
these
gatherings
of
impressionable
young
girls
to
be
trained
in
incoherence
you
ca
go
on
with
it
marjorie
regarded
him
quietly
for
a
moment
i
must
go
on
with
something
she
said
well
not
this
then
something
sane
tell
me
what
it
must
come
out
of
yourself
marjorie
thought
sullenly
for
a
moment
nothing
comes
out
of
myself
she
said
i
do
think
you
realize
a
bit
what
my
life
has
become
she
went
on
how
much
i
like
some
one
who
been
put
in
a
pleasant
prison
this
house
it
your
own
it
does
give
me
an
hour
mental
occupation
in
the
day
it
all
very
well
to
say
i
might
do
more
in
it
i
ca
without
absurdity
or
expenditure
i
ca
send
the
girl
away
and
start
scrubbing
i
make
jam
or
do
ornamental
needlework
the
shops
do
it
better
and
cheaper
and
i
have
been
trained
to
it
i
been
trained
to
do
it
i
been
brought
up
on
games
and
and
fed
on
mixed
ideas
i
ca
sit
down
and
pacify
myself
with
a
needle
as
women
used
to
do
besides
i
not
only
detest
doing
needlework
but
i
hate
it
the
sort
of
thing
a
woman
of
my
kind
does
anyhow
when
it
done
i
no
artist
i
not
sufficiently
interested
in
outside
things
to
spend
my
time
in
serious
systematic
reading
and
after
four
or
five
novels
oh
these
meetings
are
better
than
that
you
see
you
got
a
life
too
much
of
it
have
got
enough
i
wish
almost
i
could
sleep
away
half
the
day
oh
i
want
something
rag
something
more
than
i
got
a
sudden
inspiration
came
to
her
will
you
let
me
come
to
your
laboratory
and
work
with
you
she
stopped
abruptly
she
caught
up
her
own
chance
question
and
pointed
it
at
him
a
vitally
important
challenge
will
you
let
me
come
to
your
laboratory
and
work
she
repeated
trafford
thought
no
he
said
why
not
because
i
in
love
with
you
i
ca
think
of
my
work
when
about
and
you
too
much
behind
oh
my
dear
do
you
see
how
you
behind
he
paused
i
been
soaking
in
this
stuff
of
mine
for
ten
long
years
yes
assented
marjorie
flatly
he
watched
her
downcast
face
and
then
it
lifted
to
him
with
a
helpless
appeal
in
her
eyes
and
lift
in
her
voice
but
look
here
rag
she
cried
what
on
earth
am
i
to
at
least
there
came
out
of
these
discussions
one
thing
a
phrase
a
purpose
which
was
to
rule
the
lives
of
the
traffords
for
some
years
it
expressed
their
realization
that
instinct
and
impulse
had
so
far
played
them
false
that
life
for
all
its
rich
gifts
of
mutual
happiness
adjusted
between
them
we
got
they
said
to
talk
all
this
out
between
us
we
got
to
work
this
out
they
did
mean
to
leave
things
at
a
misfit
and
that
was
certainly
their
present
relation
they
were
already
at
the
problem
of
their
joint
lives
like
a
tailor
with
his
pins
and
chalk
marjorie
had
rejected
a
humorist
and
all
his
works
in
order
to
decline
at
last
to
the
humorous
view
of
life
that
rather
stupid
rather
pathetic
attitude
compounded
in
incalculable
proportions
of
goodwill
evasion
indolence
slovenliness
and
nevertheless
spite
masquerading
indeed
as
jesting
comment
which
supplies
the
fabric
of
everyday
life
for
untold
thousands
of
educated
people
she
hated
the
misfit
she
did
for
a
moment
propose
to
pretend
that
the
ungainly
twisted
sleeve
the
puckered
back
was
extremely
jolly
and
funny
she
had
married
with
a
passionate
anticipation
of
things
fitting
and
fine
and
it
was
her
nature
in
great
matters
as
in
small
to
get
what
she
wanted
strenuously
before
she
counted
the
cost
about
both
their
minds
there
was
something
sharp
and
unrelenting
and
if
marjorie
had
been
disposed
to
take
refuge
from
facts
in
swathings
of
aesthetic
romanticism
whatever
covering
she
contrived
would
have
been
torn
to
rags
very
speedily
by
that
fierce
and
steely
veracity
which
swung
down
out
of
the
laboratory
into
her
home
one
may
want
to
talk
things
out
long
before
one
hits
upon
the
phrases
that
will
open
up
the
matter
there
were
two
chief
facts
in
the
case
between
them
and
so
far
they
had
looked
only
one
in
the
face
the
fact
that
marjorie
was
unemployed
to
a
troublesome
and
distressing
extent
and
that
there
was
nothing
in
her
nature
or
training
to
supply
and
something
in
their
circumstances
and
relations
to
prevent
any
adequate
use
of
her
energies
with
the
second
fact
neither
of
them
cared
to
come
to
close
quarters
as
yet
and
neither
as
yet
saw
very
distinctly
how
it
was
linked
to
the
first
and
that
was
the
steady
excess
of
her
expenditure
over
their
restricted
means
she
was
secretly
surprised
at
her
own
weakness
week
by
week
and
month
by
month
they
were
spending
all
his
income
and
eating
into
that
little
accumulation
of
capital
that
had
once
seemed
so
sufficient
against
the
world
and
here
it
has
to
be
told
that
although
trafford
knew
that
marjorie
had
been
spending
too
much
money
he
still
had
no
idea
of
just
how
much
money
she
had
spent
she
was
doing
her
utmost
to
come
to
an
understanding
with
him
and
at
the
same
time
i
do
explain
it
i
do
excuse
it
she
was
keeping
back
her
bills
from
him
keeping
back
urgent
second
and
third
and
fourth
demands
that
she
had
no
now
to
stave
off
even
by
the
most
partial
satisfaction
it
kept
her
awake
at
nights
that
catastrophic
explanation
that
all
unsuspected
by
trafford
hung
over
their
attempts
at
mutual
elucidation
it
kept
her
awake
but
she
could
not
bring
it
to
the
speaking
point
and
she
clung
in
spite
of
her
own
intelligence
to
a
persuasion
that
they
had
got
something
really
settled
and
defined
then
it
would
be
time
enough
to
broach
the
particulars
of
this
second
divergence
talking
one
relations
over
is
particularly
easy
between
husband
and
wife
at
any
time
we
are
none
of
us
so
sure
of
one
another
as
to
risk
loose
phrases
or
make
experiments
in
expression
in
matters
so
vital
there
is
inevitably
an
excessive
caution
on
the
one
hand
and
an
abnormal
sensitiveness
to
hints
and
implications
on
the
other
marjorie
bills
were
only
an
extreme
instance
of
these
unavoidable
suppressions
that
always
occur
moreover
when
two
people
are
continuously
together
it
is
amazingly
hard
to
know
when
and
where
to
begin
where
intercourse
is
unbroken
it
is
as
a
matter
of
routine
being
constantly
interrupted
you
can
not
broach
these
broad
personalities
while
you
are
getting
up
in
the
morning
or
over
the
while
you
make
the
coffee
or
when
you
meet
again
after
a
multitude
of
small
events
at
tea
or
in
the
evening
when
one
is
rather
tired
and
trivial
after
the
work
of
the
day
then
miss
margharita
trafford
permitted
no
sustained
analysis
of
life
in
her
presence
she
synthesized
things
fallaciously
but
for
the
time
convincingly
she
insisted
that
life
was
a
thing
you
discussed
but
pink
and
soft
and
jolly
which
you
crowed
at
and
laughed
at
and
addressed
as
goo
even
without
margharita
there
were
occasions
when
the
traffords
were
a
forgetfulness
to
one
another
after
an
ear
has
been
pinched
or
a
hand
has
been
run
through
a
man
hair
or
a
pretty
bare
shoulder
kissed
all
sorts
of
broader
interests
lapse
into
a
temporary
oblivion
they
found
discussion
much
more
possible
when
they
walked
together
a
walk
seemed
to
take
them
out
of
the
everyday
sequence
isolate
them
from
their
household
abstract
them
a
little
from
one
another
they
set
out
one
extravagant
spring
sunday
to
great
missenden
and
once
in
spring
also
they
discovered
the
waterlow
park
on
each
occasion
they
seemed
to
get
through
an
enormous
amount
of
talking
but
the
great
missenden
walk
was
all
mixed
up
with
a
sweet
keen
wind
and
beechwoods
just
shot
with
spring
green
and
bursting
hedges
and
the
extreme
earliness
of
honeysuckle
which
trafford
noted
for
the
first
time
and
a
clamorous
rejoicing
of
birds
and
in
the
waterlow
park
there
was
a
great
discussion
of
why
the
yellow
crocus
comes
before
white
and
purple
and
the
closest
examination
of
the
manner
in
which
daffodils
and
narcissi
thrust
their
green
noses
out
of
the
garden
beds
also
they
found
the
ugly
aggressively
propagandist
in
that
gracious
old
house
a
scandal
and
disappointment
and
trafford
scolded
at
the
stupidity
of
officialdom
that
can
control
so
fine
a
thing
so
ill
though
they
talked
on
these
walks
they
were
still
curiously
evasive
indeed
they
were
afraid
of
each
other
they
kept
falling
away
from
their
private
thoughts
and
intentions
they
generalized
they
discussed
marriage
and
george
gissing
and
bernard
shaw
and
the
suffrage
movement
and
the
agitation
for
the
reform
of
the
divorce
laws
they
pursued
imaginary
cases
into
distant
thickets
of
contingency
remotely
far
from
the
personal
issues
between
them
one
day
came
an
incident
that
marjorie
found
wonderfully
illuminating
trafford
had
a
fit
of
rage
stung
by
an
unexpected
irritation
he
forgot
himself
as
people
say
and
swore
and
was
almost
physically
violent
and
the
curious
thing
was
that
so
he
lit
up
things
for
her
as
no
premeditated
attempt
of
his
had
ever
done
a
copy
of
the
fired
the
explosion
he
sat
down
at
the
with
the
heaviness
of
a
rather
overworked
and
worried
man
tasted
his
coffee
tore
open
a
letter
and
crumpled
it
with
his
hand
turned
to
the
regarded
its
list
of
contents
with
a
start
opened
it
read
for
a
minute
and
expressed
himself
with
an
extraordinary
heat
of
manner
in
these
amazing
and
unprecedented
words
oh
damnation
and
damnation
then
he
shied
the
paper
into
the
corner
of
the
room
and
pushed
his
plate
from
him
damn
the
whole
scheme
of
things
he
said
and
met
the
blank
amazement
of
marjorie
eye
behrens
he
said
with
an
air
of
explanation
behrens
she
echoed
with
a
note
of
inquiry
he
doing
my
stuff
he
sat
darkling
for
a
time
and
then
hit
the
table
with
his
fist
so
hard
that
the
breakfast
things
seemed
to
jump
together
to
infinite
amazement
i
ca
it
he
said
she
waited
some
moments
i
do
understand
she
began
what
has
he
done
oh
was
trafford
answer
he
got
up
recovered
the
crumpled
paper
and
stood
reading
fool
and
thief
he
said
marjorie
was
amazed
beyond
measure
she
felt
as
though
she
had
been
effaced
from
trafford
life
ugh
he
cried
and
slapped
back
the
into
the
corner
with
quite
needless
violence
he
became
aware
of
marjorie
again
he
doing
my
work
he
said
and
then
as
if
he
completed
the
explanation
and
i
got
to
be
in
croydon
by
ten
to
lecture
to
a
pack
of
spinsters
and
duffers
because
they
too
stupid
to
get
the
stuff
from
books
it
all
in
books
every
bit
of
it
he
paused
and
went
on
in
tones
of
unendurable
wrong
it
is
as
though
he
was
doing
it
right
he
is
he
ca
he
a
fool
he
a
clever
greedy
dishonest
fool
with
a
twist
oh
the
pile
the
big
pile
of
silly
muddled
technicalities
he
invented
already
the
solemn
mess
making
of
it
and
there
he
is
i
ca
get
ahead
of
him
i
ca
get
at
him
i
got
no
time
i
got
no
room
or
leisure
to
swing
my
mind
in
oh
curse
these
engagements
curse
all
these
silly
fretting
entanglements
of
lecture
and
article
i
never
get
the
time
i
ca
get
the
time
i
ca
get
my
mind
clear
i
worried
i
badgered
and
meanwhile
behrens
is
he
discovering
what
you
want
to
discover
behrens
he
going
through
the
breaches
i
made
he
guessing
out
what
i
meant
to
do
and
he
getting
it
set
out
all
wrong
misleading
terminology
distinctions
made
in
the
wrong
place
oh
the
fool
he
is
but
afterwards
afterwards
i
may
spend
my
life
removing
the
obstacles
he
made
be
established
and
i
sha
you
do
know
anything
of
these
things
you
do
understand
she
did
her
next
question
showed
as
much
will
it
affect
your
she
asked
oh
safe
enough
and
it
does
matter
anyhow
the
confound
the
silly
little
as
if
that
mattered
it
seeing
all
my
great
openings
misused
it
seeing
all
i
might
be
doing
this
brings
it
all
home
to
me
do
you
understand
marjorie
will
you
never
understand
i
getting
away
from
all
i
being
hustled
away
by
all
this
work
this
silly
everyday
work
to
get
money
do
you
see
that
unless
i
can
have
time
for
thought
and
research
life
is
just
darkness
to
me
i
made
myself
master
of
that
stuff
i
had
at
any
rate
no
one
can
do
what
i
can
do
there
and
when
i
find
myself
oh
shut
out
shut
out
i
come
near
raving
as
i
think
of
it
i
want
to
rave
again
he
paused
then
with
a
swift
transition
i
suppose
i
better
eat
some
breakfast
is
that
egg
boiled
she
gave
him
an
egg
brought
his
coffee
put
things
before
him
seated
herself
at
the
table
for
a
little
while
he
ate
in
silence
then
he
cursed
behrens
look
here
she
said
bad
as
i
am
you
got
to
reason
with
me
rag
i
did
know
all
this
i
did
understand
i
do
know
what
to
do
what
there
to
do
i
got
to
do
something
i
beginning
to
see
things
it
just
as
though
everything
had
become
clear
suddenly
she
was
weeping
oh
my
dear
i
want
to
help
you
i
have
so
wanted
to
help
you
always
and
come
to
this
but
it
not
fault
i
did
mean
that
it
it
in
the
nature
of
things
it
my
fault
it
not
your
fault
it
is
confound
it
marjorie
when
i
swear
at
behrens
i
not
swearing
at
you
it
my
fault
all
this
is
my
fault
i
eating
you
up
what
the
good
of
your
pretending
rag
you
know
it
is
oh
when
i
married
you
i
meant
to
make
you
happy
i
had
no
thought
but
to
make
you
happy
to
give
myself
to
you
my
body
my
brains
everything
to
make
life
beautiful
for
you
well
you
he
thrust
out
a
hand
she
did
not
take
i
broken
your
back
she
said
an
unwonted
resolution
came
into
her
face
her
lips
whitened
do
you
know
rag
she
said
forcing
herself
to
speak
do
you
guess
you
do
know
half
in
that
bureau
there
in
there
it
stuffed
with
bills
unpaid
bills
she
was
weeping
with
no
attempt
to
wipe
the
streaming
tears
away
terror
made
the
expression
of
her
wet
face
almost
fierce
bills
she
repeated
more
than
a
hundred
pounds
still
yes
now
he
drew
back
stared
at
her
and
with
no
trace
of
personal
animus
like
one
who
hears
of
a
common
disaster
remarked
with
a
quiet
emphasis
oh
i
know
she
said
damn
and
met
his
eyes
there
was
a
long
silence
between
them
she
produced
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
eyes
what
i
amount
to
she
said
it
your
silly
upbringing
he
said
after
a
long
pause
and
my
silly
self
she
stood
up
unlocked
and
opened
her
littered
desk
turned
and
held
out
the
key
to
him
why
he
asked
take
it
you
gave
me
a
of
my
own
and
a
corner
of
my
own
and
they
they
are
just
ambushes
against
you
he
shook
his
head
take
it
said
marjorie
with
quiet
insistence
he
obeyed
she
stood
with
her
eyes
on
the
crumpled
heap
of
bills
they
were
not
even
tidily
arranged
that
seemed
to
her
now
an
extreme
aggravation
of
her
offence
i
ought
to
be
sent
to
the
chemist
she
remarked
as
one
sends
a
worthless
cat
trafford
weighed
this
proposition
soberly
for
some
moments
you
a
bother
marjorie
he
said
with
his
eyes
on
the
desk
no
end
of
a
bother
i
better
have
those
bills
he
looked
at
her
stood
up
put
his
hands
on
her
shoulders
drew
her
to
him
and
kissed
her
forehead
he
did
it
without
passion
without
tenderness
with
something
like
resignation
in
his
manner
she
clung
to
him
tightly
as
though
by
clinging
she
could
warm
and
soften
him
rag
she
whispered
all
my
heart
is
yours
i
want
to
help
you
and
this
is
what
i
have
done
i
know
he
said
almost
grimly
he
repeated
his
kiss
then
he
seemed
to
explode
again
gods
he
cried
look
at
the
clock
i
shall
miss
that
croydon
lecture
he
pushed
her
from
him
where
are
my
boots
marjorie
spent
the
forenoon
and
the
earlier
part
of
the
afternoon
repeating
and
reviewing
this
conversation
her
mind
was
full
of
the
long
disregarded
problem
of
her
husband
state
of
mind
she
thought
with
a
sympathetic
astonishment
of
his
swearing
of
his
startling
blow
upon
the
table
she
had
so
far
known
he
could
swear
but
this
was
the
real
thing
the
relief
of
vehement
and
destructive
words
his
voice
saying
damnation
and
damnation
echoed
and
in
her
ears
somehow
she
understood
that
as
she
had
never
understood
any
sober
statement
of
his
case
such
women
as
marjorie
i
think
have
an
altogether
keener
understanding
of
people
who
have
lost
control
of
themselves
than
they
have
of
reasoned
cases
perhaps
that
is
because
they
themselves
always
reserve
something
when
they
state
a
reasoned
case
she
went
on
to
the
apprehension
of
a
change
in
him
that
hitherto
she
had
not
permitted
herself
to
see
a
change
in
his
attitude
to
her
there
had
been
a
time
when
she
had
seemed
able
without
an
effort
to
nestle
inside
his
heart
now
she
felt
distinctly
for
the
first
time
that
that
happened
she
had
instead
a
sense
of
her
embrace
sliding
over
a
rather
deliberately
contracted
exterior
of
course
he
had
been
in
a
hurry
she
tried
to
follow
him
on
his
journey
to
croydon
now
he
have
just
passed
out
of
london
bridge
what
was
he
thinking
and
feeling
about
her
in
the
train
now
he
would
be
going
into
the
place
wherever
it
was
where
he
gave
his
lecture
did
he
think
of
behrens
and
curse
her
under
his
breath
as
he
entered
that
tiresome
room
it
seemed
part
of
the
prevailing
inconvenience
of
life
that
daffy
should
see
fit
to
pay
an
afternoon
call
marjorie
heard
the
sobs
and
uproar
of
an
arrested
motor
and
glanced
discreetly
from
the
window
to
discover
the
dark
green
car
with
its
chauffeur
which
now
adorned
her
sister
life
and
which
might
under
different
circumstances
have
adorned
her
own
wilkins
his
name
was
wilkins
his
hair
was
sandy
and
his
expression
discreet
and
he
afforded
material
for
much
quiet
humorous
observation
descended
smartly
and
opened
the
door
daffy
appeared
in
black
velvet
with
a
huge
black
fur
muff
and
an
air
of
being
unaware
that
there
were
such
things
as
windows
in
the
world
it
was
just
four
and
the
who
ought
to
have
been
now
in
her
housemaid
phase
was
still
upstairs
divesting
herself
of
her
more
culinary
characteristics
marjorie
opened
the
door
hullo
old
daffy
she
said
hullo
old
madge
and
there
was
an
exchange
of
sisterly
kisses
and
a
mutual
inspection
nothing
wrong
asked
daffy
surveying
her
you
look
pale
and
tired
about
the
eyes
said
daffy
leading
the
way
into
the
thought
you
might
be
a
bit
off
it
that
all
no
offence
madge
i
all
right
said
marjorie
getting
her
back
to
the
light
want
a
holiday
perhaps
how
every
one
all
right
off
to
lake
garda
next
week
this
new
play
has
taken
it
out
of
will
tremendously
he
wants
a
rest
and
fresh
surroundings
it
to
be
the
biggest
piece
of
work
he
done
so
far
and
straining
him
and
people
worry
him
here
receptions
first
nights
dinners
speeches
he
so
neat
you
know
in
his
speeches
but
it
wastes
him
he
wants
to
get
away
how
rag
busy
lecturing
and
his
research
of
course
oh
of
course
how
the
babe
just
in
come
up
and
see
the
little
beast
daffy
it
is
getting
so
pretty
and
it
talks
margharita
dominated
intercourse
for
a
time
she
was
one
of
those
tactful
infants
who
exactly
resemble
their
fathers
and
exactly
resemble
their
mothers
and
have
a
charm
and
individuality
quite
distinctly
their
own
and
she
was
now
beginning
to
converse
with
startling
enterprise
and
intelligence
big
big
bog
she
said
at
the
sight
of
daffy
remembers
you
said
marjorie
bog
go
said
margharita
there
said
marjorie
and
may
the
nurse
in
the
background
smiled
unlimited
appreciation
bably
said
margharita
that
herself
said
marjorie
falling
on
her
knees
she
talks
like
this
all
day
oh
de
sweetums
den
it
daffy
made
amiable
gestures
and
noises
with
her
lips
and
margharita
responded
jovially
you
darling
cried
marjorie
you
delight
of
life
kneeling
by
the
cot
and
giving
the
crowing
healthy
little
mite
a
passionate
hug
it
really
the
nicest
of
babies
daffy
conceded
and
reflected
i
do
know
what
i
should
do
with
a
kiddy
said
daffy
as
the
infant
worship
came
to
an
end
i
really
glad
we
have
one
yet
he
love
it
i
know
but
it
would
be
a
burthen
in
some
ways
they
a
tie
as
he
says
the
next
few
years
means
so
much
for
him
of
course
here
his
reputation
is
immense
and
he
known
in
germany
and
there
are
translations
into
russian
but
he
still
got
to
conquer
america
and
he
is
really
well
known
yet
in
france
they
read
him
of
course
and
buy
him
in
america
but
they
oh
i
do
so
wish
they
give
him
the
nobel
prize
madge
and
have
done
with
it
it
would
settle
everything
still
as
he
says
we
must
think
of
that
yet
anyhow
he
is
venerable
enough
it
doubtful
he
thinks
that
they
would
give
the
nobel
prize
to
any
humorist
now
that
mark
twain
is
dead
mark
twain
was
different
you
see
because
of
the
german
emperor
and
all
that
white
hair
and
everything
at
this
point
margharita
discovered
that
the
conversation
had
drifted
away
from
herself
and
it
was
only
when
they
got
downstairs
again
that
daffy
could
resume
the
thread
of
magnet
career
which
had
evidently
become
the
predominant
interest
in
her
life
she
brought
out
all
the
worst
elements
of
marjorie
nature
and
their
sisterly
relationship
there
were
moments
when
it
became
nakedly
apparent
that
she
was
magnifying
magnet
to
belittle
trafford
marjorie
did
her
best
to
she
played
her
chief
card
in
the
they
always
ask
will
to
the
royal
society
dinner
threw
out
daffy
but
of
course
he
ca
always
go
he
asked
to
so
many
things
five
years
earlier
marjorie
would
have
kicked
her
shins
for
that
instead
she
asked
pointedly
offensively
if
magnet
was
any
balder
he
not
really
bald
said
daffy
unruffled
and
went
on
to
discuss
the
advisability
of
a
second
motor
car
purely
for
town
use
i
tell
him
i
do
want
it
said
daffy
but
he
frightfully
keen
upon
getting
one
when
daffy
had
at
last
gone
marjorie
went
back
into
trafford
study
and
stood
on
the
hearthrug
regarding
its
appointments
with
something
of
the
air
of
one
who
awakens
from
a
dream
she
had
developed
a
new
appalling
thought
was
daffy
really
a
better
wife
than
herself
it
was
dawning
upon
marjorie
that
she
had
been
doing
the
right
thing
by
her
husband
and
she
was
as
surprised
as
if
it
had
been
suddenly
brought
home
to
her
that
she
was
neglecting
margharita
this
was
her
husband
study
and
it
showed
just
a
little
dusty
in
the
afternoon
sunshine
and
everything
about
it
denied
the
pretensions
of
serene
sustained
work
that
she
had
always
made
to
herself
here
were
the
crumpled
galley
proofs
of
his
science
notes
here
were
unanswered
letters
there
she
dare
not
touch
them
were
computations
under
a
glass
what
did
they
amount
to
now
on
the
table
under
the
window
were
back
numbers
of
the
in
a
rather
untidy
pile
and
on
the
footstool
by
the
she
had
been
accustomed
to
sit
at
his
feet
when
he
stayed
at
home
to
work
and
look
into
the
fire
and
watch
him
furtively
and
sometimes
give
way
to
an
overmastering
tenderness
and
make
love
to
him
the
thought
of
magnet
pampered
fenced
around
revered
in
his
industrious
tiresome
repetitions
variations
dramatizations
and
so
forth
of
the
dry
little
old
jokes
which
the
british
public
accepted
as
his
characteristic
offering
and
rewarded
him
for
so
highly
contrasted
vividly
with
her
new
realization
of
trafford
thankless
work
and
worried
face
and
she
loved
him
she
loved
him
she
told
herself
in
the
presence
of
all
these
facts
and
without
a
shadow
of
doubt
in
her
mind
that
all
she
wanted
in
the
world
was
to
make
him
happy
it
occurred
to
her
as
a
rather
drastic
means
to
this
end
that
she
might
commit
suicide
she
had
already
gone
some
way
in
the
composition
of
a
touching
letter
of
farewell
to
him
containing
a
luminous
analysis
of
her
own
defects
before
her
swept
away
this
imaginative
exercise
meanwhile
as
if
it
had
been
working
at
her
problem
all
the
time
that
this
exciting
farewell
epistle
had
occupied
the
foreground
of
her
thoughts
her
natural
lucidity
emerged
with
the
manifest
conclusion
that
she
had
to
alter
her
way
of
living
she
had
been
extraordinarily
regardless
of
him
she
only
began
to
see
that
and
now
she
had
to
take
up
the
problem
of
his
necessities
her
now
that
it
had
begun
was
thorough
she
had
always
told
herself
before
that
she
had
made
a
most
wonderful
and
beautiful
little
home
for
him
but
had
she
made
it
for
him
had
he
as
a
matter
of
fact
ever
wanted
it
except
that
he
was
glad
to
have
it
through
her
no
doubt
it
had
given
him
delight
and
happiness
it
had
been
a
marvellous
little
casket
of
love
for
them
but
how
far
did
that
outweigh
the
burthen
and
limitation
it
had
imposed
upon
him
she
had
always
assumed
he
was
beyond
measure
grateful
to
her
for
his
home
in
spite
of
all
her
bills
but
was
he
it
was
like
sticking
a
knife
into
herself
to
ask
that
but
she
was
now
in
a
phase
heroic
enough
for
the
task
was
he
she
had
always
seen
herself
as
the
giver
of
bounties
greatest
bounty
of
all
was
margharita
she
had
faced
pains
and
terrors
and
the
shadow
of
death
to
give
him
margharita
now
with
illuminating
conversation
in
her
mind
she
could
turn
the
light
upon
a
haunting
doubt
that
had
been
lurking
in
the
darkness
for
a
long
time
had
he
really
so
greatly
wanted
margharita
had
she
ever
troubled
to
get
to
the
bottom
of
that
before
had
she
as
a
matter
of
fact
wanted
margharita
ten
thousand
times
more
than
he
had
done
had
she
in
effect
imposed
margharita
upon
him
as
she
had
imposed
her
distinctive
and
delightful
home
upon
him
regardlessly
because
these
things
were
the
natural
and
legitimate
developments
of
herself
these
things
were
not
his
ends
had
she
hitherto
ever
really
cared
what
his
ends
might
be
a
phrase
she
had
heard
abundantly
enough
in
current
feminist
discussion
recurred
to
her
mind
the
economic
dependence
of
women
and
now
for
the
first
time
it
was
charged
with
meaning
she
had
imposed
these
things
upon
him
not
because
she
loved
him
but
because
these
things
that
were
the
expansions
and
consequences
of
her
love
for
him
were
only
obtainable
through
him
a
woman
gives
herself
to
a
man
out
of
love
and
remains
clinging
parasitically
to
him
out
of
necessity
was
there
no
way
of
evading
that
necessity
for
a
time
she
entertained
dreams
of
marvellous
social
reconstructions
suppose
the
community
kept
all
its
women
suppose
all
property
in
homes
and
furnishings
and
children
vested
in
them
that
was
marjorie
version
of
that
idea
of
the
endowment
of
womanhood
which
has
been
creeping
into
contemporary
thought
during
the
last
two
decades
then
every
woman
would
be
a
princess
to
the
man
she
loved
he
became
more
definitely
personal
suppose
she
herself
was
rich
then
she
could
play
the
princess
to
trafford
she
could
have
him
free
unencumbered
happy
and
her
lover
then
indeed
her
gifts
would
be
gifts
and
all
her
instincts
and
motives
would
but
crown
his
unhampered
life
she
could
not
go
on
from
that
idea
she
lapsed
into
a
golden
reverie
from
which
she
was
roused
by
the
clock
striking
five
in
half
an
hour
perhaps
trafford
would
be
home
again
she
could
at
least
be
so
much
of
a
princess
as
to
make
his
home
sweet
for
his
there
should
be
tea
in
here
where
callers
did
not
trouble
she
glanced
at
an
empty
copper
vase
it
ached
there
was
no
light
in
the
room
there
would
be
just
time
to
dash
out
into
high
street
and
buy
some
flowers
for
it
before
he
came
spring
and
a
renewed
and
deepened
love
for
her
husband
were
in
marjorie
blood
her
mind
worked
rapidly
during
the
next
few
days
and
presently
she
found
herself
clearly
decided
upon
her
course
of
action
she
had
to
pull
herself
together
and
help
him
and
if
that
meant
a
spartan
and
strenuous
way
of
living
then
manifestly
she
must
be
spartan
and
strenuous
she
must
put
an
end
once
for
all
to
her
recurrent
domestic
deficits
and
since
this
could
only
be
done
by
getting
rid
of
may
she
must
get
rid
of
may
and
mind
the
child
herself
every
day
thank
heaven
margharita
became
more
intelligent
more
manageable
and
more
interesting
then
she
must
also
make
a
far
more
systematic
and
thorough
study
of
domestic
economy
than
she
had
hitherto
done
and
run
the
shopping
and
housekeeping
on
severer
lines
she
bought
fruit
carelessly
they
had
far
too
many
joints
she
never
seemed
able
to
restrain
herself
when
it
came
to
flowers
and
in
the
evenings
which
would
necessarily
be
very
frequently
lonely
evenings
if
researches
were
to
go
on
she
would
typewrite
and
either
acquire
great
speed
at
that
or
learn
shorthand
and
so
save
trafford
present
expenditure
on
a
typist
that
unfortunately
would
mean
buying
a
typewriter
she
found
one
afternoon
in
a
twopenny
with
which
she
was
trying
to
allay
her
craving
for
purchases
a
tattered
little
pamphlet
entitled
proposals
for
the
establishment
of
an
order
of
samurai
which
fell
in
very
exactly
with
her
mood
the
title
dated
it
carried
her
mind
back
to
her
middle
girlhood
and
the
defeats
of
kuropatki
and
the
futile
earnest
phase
in
english
thought
which
followed
the
boer
war
the
order
was
to
be
a
sort
of
nobility
serving
the
world
it
shone
with
the
light
of
a
generous
dawn
but
cast
i
fear
the
shadow
of
the
prig
its
end
was
the
agenda
club
she
read
and
ceased
to
read
and
dreamt
the
project
unfolded
the
picture
of
a
new
method
of
conduct
to
her
austere
yet
picturesque
and
richly
noble
these
samurai
it
was
intimated
were
to
lead
lives
of
hard
discipline
and
high
effort
under
rule
and
restraint
they
were
to
stand
a
little
apart
from
the
excitements
and
temptations
of
everyday
life
to
eat
sparingly
drink
water
resort
greatly
to
and
and
harden
their
spirits
by
severe
and
dangerous
exercises
they
were
to
dress
simply
work
hard
and
be
the
conscious
and
deliberate
salt
of
the
world
they
were
to
walk
among
mountains
incidentally
great
power
was
to
be
given
them
such
systematic
effort
and
as
this
seemed
to
marjorie
to
give
just
all
she
was
and
needed
to
be
to
save
her
life
and
trafford
from
a
common
disaster
it
particularly
appealed
to
her
that
they
were
to
walk
among
mountains
but
it
is
hard
to
make
a
change
in
the
colour
of
one
life
amidst
the
routine
one
has
already
established
about
oneself
in
the
house
that
is
grooved
by
one
weaknesses
amidst
hangings
and
ornaments
living
and
breathing
with
the
life
of
an
antagonistic
and
yet
insidiously
congenial
ideal
a
great
desire
came
upon
marjorie
to
go
away
with
trafford
for
a
time
out
of
their
everyday
life
into
strange
and
cool
and
spacious
surroundings
she
wanted
to
leave
london
and
its
shops
and
the
home
and
the
movements
and
the
callers
and
rivalries
and
even
dimpled
little
margharita
insistent
claims
and
get
free
and
think
it
was
the
first
invasion
of
their
lives
by
this
conception
a
conception
that
was
ever
afterwards
to
leave
them
altogether
of
retreat
and
reconstruction
she
knelt
upon
the
white
sheepskin
hearthrug
at
trafford
feet
one
night
and
told
him
of
her
desire
he
too
was
tired
of
his
work
and
his
vexations
and
ripe
for
this
suggestion
of
an
altered
life
the
easter
holiday
was
approaching
and
nearly
twenty
unencumbered
days
trafford
they
knew
would
come
into
the
house
meanwhile
and
care
for
margharita
they
would
go
away
somewhere
together
and
walk
no
luggage
but
a
couple
of
knapsacks
no
hotel
but
some
homely
village
inn
they
would
be
in
the
air
all
day
until
they
were
saturated
with
sweet
air
and
spirit
of
clean
restraints
they
would
plan
out
their
new
rule
concentrate
their
aims
and
i
could
think
said
trafford
of
this
new
work
i
ca
begin
here
i
might
make
some
notes
presently
came
the
question
of
where
the
great
walk
should
be
manifestly
it
must
be
among
mountains
manifestly
and
marjorie
eye
saw
those
mountains
with
snow
upon
their
summits
and
cold
glaciers
on
their
flanks
could
they
get
to
switzerland
if
they
travelled
second
class
throughout
and
took
the
cheaper
way
as
samurai
should
that
holiday
seemed
to
marjorie
as
if
they
had
found
a
lost
and
forgotten
piece
of
honeymoon
she
had
that
same
sense
of
fresh
beginnings
that
had
made
their
first
walk
in
italian
switzerland
so
unforgettable
she
was
filled
with
the
happiness
of
recovering
trafford
when
he
had
seemed
to
be
slipping
from
her
all
day
they
talked
of
their
outlook
and
how
they
might
economise
away
the
need
of
his
extra
work
and
so
release
him
for
his
search
again
for
the
first
time
he
talked
of
his
work
to
her
and
gave
her
some
intimation
of
its
scope
and
quality
he
became
enthusiastic
with
the
sudden
invention
of
experimental
devices
so
that
it
seemed
to
her
almost
worth
while
if
instead
of
going
on
they
bolted
back
he
to
his
laboratory
and
she
to
her
nursery
and
so
at
once
inaugurated
the
new
régime
but
they
went
on
to
finish
the
holiday
out
and
the
delight
of
being
together
again
with
unfettered
hours
of
association
they
rediscovered
each
other
the
same
and
a
little
changed
if
their
emotions
were
less
bright
and
intense
their
interest
was
far
wider
and
deeper
the
season
was
too
early
for
high
passes
and
the
weather
was
changeable
they
started
from
fribourg
and
walked
to
thun
and
then
back
to
bulle
and
so
to
bultigen

montbovon
and
the
lake
of
geneva
they
had
rain
several
days
the
sweet
soft
windless
mountain
rain
that
seemed
so
tolerable
to
those
who
are
accustomed
to
the
hard
and
driven
downpours
of
england
and
in
places
they
found
mud
and
receding
snow
the
inns
were
at
their
homeliest
and
none
the
worse
for
that
and
there
were
days
of
spring
sunshine
when
a
multitude
of
minute
and
delightful
flowers
came
out
as
it
seemed
to
meet
them
it
was
impossible
to
suppose
so
great
a
concourse
universal
and
spread
in
a
scented
carpet
before
their
straying
feet
the
fruit
trees
in
the
valleys
were
powdered
with
blossom
and
the
new
grass
seemed
rather
sunlight
than
merely
green
and
they
walked
with
a
sort
of
stout
leisureliness
knapsacks
and
cloaks
about
them
with
their
faces
fresh
and
bright
under
the
bracing
weather
and
their
lungs
deep
charged
with
mountain
air
talking
of
the
new
austerer
life
that
was
now
beginning
with
great
mountains
in
the
background
streaming
precipices
overhead
and
a
sward
of
flowers
to
go
upon
that
strenuous
prospect
was
altogether
delightful
they
went
as
it
pleased
them
making
detours
into
valleys
coming
back
upon
their
steps
the
interludes
of
hot
bright
april
sunshine
made
them
indolent
and
they
would
loiter
and
halt
where
some
rock
or
wall
invited
and
sit
basking
like
happy
animals
talking
very
little
for
long
hours
together
trafford
seemed
to
have
forgotten
all
the
strain
and
disappointment
of
the
past
two
years
to
be
amazed
but
in
no
wise
incredulous
at
this
enormous
change
in
her
and
in
their
outlook
it
filled
her
with
a
passion
of
pride
and
high
resolve
to
think
that
so
she
could
recover
and
uplift
him
he
was
now
very
deeply
in
love
with
her
again
he
talked
indeed
of
his
research
but
so
that
it
might
interest
her
and
when
he
thought
alone
he
thought
not
of
it
but
of
her
making
again
the
old
discoveries
his
intense
delight
in
the
quality
of
her
voice
his
joy
in
a
certain
indescribable
gallantry
in
her
bearing
he
pitied
all
men
whose
wives
could
not
carry
themselves
and
whose
voices
failed
and
broke
under
the
things
they
had
to
say
and
then
again
there
was
the
way
she
moved
her
arms
the
way
her
hands
took
hold
of
things
the
alert
lucidity
of
her
eyes
and
then
that
faint
soft
shadow
of
a
smile
upon
her
lips
when
she
walked
thinking
or
observant
all
unaware
that
he
was
watching
her
it
rained
in
the
morning
of
their
eleventh
day
and
then
gave
way
to
warmth
and
sunshine
so
that
they
arrived
at
les
avants
in
the
afternoon
a
little
muddy
and
rather
hot
at
one
of
the
tables
under
the
trees
outside
the
grand
hotel
was
a
small
group
of
people
dressed
in
the
remarkable
and
imposing
costume
which
still
in
those
days
distinguished
the
motorist
they
turned
from
their
tea
to
a
more
or
less
frank
inspection
of
the
traffords
and
suddenly
broke
out
into
cries
of
recognition
and
welcome
solomonson
for
the
most
part
brown
leather
emerged
with
extended
hands
and
behind
him
nestling
in
the
midst
of
immense
and
costly
furs
appeared
the
kindly
salience
and
brightness
of
his
lady
face
good
luck
cried
solomonson
good
luck
come
and
have
tea
with
us
but
this
is
a
happy
encounter
we
dirty
but
so
healthy
cried
marjorie
saluting
lady
solomonson
you
look
oh
splendidly
well
that
lady
responded
we
been
walking
with
just
that
knapsack
it
been
glorious
but
the
courage
said
lady
solomonson
and
did
not
add
the
tragic
hardship
though
her
tone
conveyed
it
she
had
all
the
unquestioning
belief
of
her
race
in
the
sanity
of
comfort
she
had
ingrained
in
her
the
most
definite
ideas
of
man
position
and
woman
and
that
any
one
man
or
woman
should
walk
in
mud
except
under
dire
necessity
was
outside
the
range
of
her
philosophy
she
thought
marjorie
thick
boots
and
short
skirts
quite
the
most
appalling
feminine
costume
she
had
ever
seen
she
saw
only
a
ruined
complexion
and
damaged
womanhood
in
marjorie
cheek
her
benevolent
heart
rebelled
at
the
spectacle
it
was
dreadful
she
thought
that
nice
young
people
like
the
traffords
should
have
come
to
this
the
rest
of
the
party
were
now
informally
introduced
they
were
all
very
splendid
and
disconcertingly
free
from
mud
one
was
christabel
morrison
the
actress
a
graceful
figure
in
a
green
baize
coat
and
brown
fur
who
looked
ever
so
much
more
charming
than
her
innumerable
postcards
and
portraits
would
have
led
one
to
expect
her
neighbour
was
solomonson
cousin
lee
the
organizer
of
the
theatre
syndicate
a
attenuated
little
man
with
an
accent
that
struck
trafford
as
being
on
the
whole
rather
dutch
and
the
third
lady
was
lady
solomonson
sister
lee
it
appeared
they
were
all
staying
at
lee
villa
above
vevey
part
of
an
amusing
assembly
of
people
who
were
either
vividly
rich
or
even
more
vividly
clever
an
accumulation
which
the
traffords
in
the
course
of
the
next
twenty
minutes
were
three
times
invited
with
an
increasing
appreciation
and
earnestness
to
join
from
the
first
our
two
young
people
were
not
indisposed
to
do
so
for
eleven
days
they
had
maintained
their
duologue
at
the
very
highest
level
seven
days
remained
to
them
before
they
must
go
back
to
begin
the
hard
new
life
in
england
and
there
was
something
very
attractive
they
did
not
for
a
moment
seek
to
discover
the
elements
of
that
attractiveness
in
this
proposal
of
five
or
six
days
of
luxurious
indolence
above
the
lake
a
sort
of
farewell
to
the
worldly
side
of
worldly
things
before
they
set
forth
upon
the
high
and
narrow
path
they
had
resolved
to
tread
but
we
got
no
clothes
cried
marjorie
no
clothes
at
all
these
hobnail
boots
and
a
pair
each
of
heelless
slippers
my
dear
cried
lady
solomonson
in
real
distress
and
as
much
aside
as
circumstances
permitted
my
dear
my
sister
can
manage
all
that
her
voice
fell
to
earnest
undertones
we
can
really
manage
all
that
the
house
is
packed
with
things
we
come
to
dinner
in
fancy
dress
and
scott
my
maid
is
so
clever
but
really
said
marjorie
my
dear
said
lady
solomonson
everything
and
she
changed
places
with
lee
in
order
to
be
perfectly
confidential
and
explicit
rachel
she
cried
and
summoned
her
sister
for
confirmatory
assurances
but
my
husband
marjorie
became
audible
we
long
persian
robes
said
lee
with
a
glance
of
undisguised
appraisement
he
be
splendid
he
look
like
a
soldan
the
rest
of
the
company
forced
a
hectic
conversation
in
order
not
to
seem
to
listen
and
presently
lady
solomonson
and
her
sister
were
triumphant
they
packed
marjorie
into
the
motor
car
and
trafford
and
solomonson
returned
to
vevey
by
train
and
thence
up
to
the
villa
by
a
hired
automobile
they
did
go
outside
the
magic
confines
of
the
lees
villa
for
three
days
and
when
they
did
they
were
still
surrounded
by
their
service
and
possessions
they
made
an
excursion
to
chillon
in
his
and
went
in
his
to
lunch
with
the
maynards
in
their
villa
close
to
geneva
during
all
that
time
they
seemed
lifted
off
the
common
earth
into
a
world
of
fine
fabrics
agreeable
sounds
noiseless
unlimited
service
and
ample
untroubled
living
it
had
an
effect
of
enchantment
and
the
long
healthy
arduous
journey
thither
seemed
a
tale
of
incredible
effort
amidst
these
sunny
excesses
the
weather
had
the
whim
to
be
serenely
fine
sunshine
like
summer
and
the
bluest
of
skies
shone
above
the
white
wall
and
the
ilex
thickets
and
cypresses
that
bounded
them
in
from
the
great
world
of
crowded
homes
and
sous
and
small
necessities
and
through
the
texture
of
it
all
for
trafford
ran
a
thread
of
curious
new
suggestion
an
intermittent
discussion
of
economics
and
socialism
was
going
on
between
himself
and
solomonson
and
an
agreeable
little
stammering
man
in
brown
named
minter
who
walked
up
in
the
afternoon
from
vevey
he
professed
to
be
writing
a
novel
during
the
earlier
half
of
the
day
minter
displayed
the
keenest
appreciation
of
everything
in
his
entertainment
and
blinked
cheerfully
and
expressed
opinions
of
the
extremest
socialistic
and
anarchistic
flavour
to
an
accompaniment
of
grateful
your
is
wonderful
lee
he
would
say
sipping
it
a
terrible
retribution
will
fall
upon
you
some
day
for
all
this
the
villa
had
been
designed
by
lee
to
please
his
wife
and
if
it
was
neither
very
beautiful
nor
very
dignified
it
was
at
any
rate
very
pretty
and
amusing
it
might
have
been
built
by
a
parisian
dressmaker
in
the
châteauesque
style
it
was
of
stone
with
a
roof
of
tiles
it
had
little
balconies
and
acutely
roofed
turrets
and
almost
burlesque
buttresses
pierced
by
doors
and
gates
and
loggias
as
pleasantly
casual
as
the
bows
and
embroideries
of
a
woman
dress
and
its
central
hall
with
an
impluvium
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
and
its
to
which
one
ascended
from
this
hall
between
pillars
up
five
broad
steps
were
entirely
irrelevant
to
all
its
exterior
features
unobtrusive
in
grey
with
scarlet
facings
hovered
serviceably
from
the
little
terrace
all
set
with
in
tubs
one
could
see
through
the
branches
and
stems
of
evergreens
and
over
a
foreground
of
budding
starting
vineyard
the
clustering
roofs
of
vevey
below
an
agglomeration
veiled
ever
so
thinly
in
the
morning
by
a
cobweb
of
wood
smoke
against
the
blue
background
of
lake
with
its
winged
and
sombre
alpine
distances
minter
made
it
all
significant
by
a
wave
of
the
hand
all
this
he
said
and
of
the
crowded
life
below
all
that
all
this
with
its
rich
litter
of
stuffs
and
ornaments
its
fine
profusion
its
delicacies
of
flower
and
food
and
furniture
its
frequent
inconsecutive
pleasures
its
noiseless
ready
service
was
remarkably
novel
and
yet
remarkably
familiar
to
trafford
for
a
time
he
could
not
understand
this
undertone
of
familiarity
and
then
a
sunlit
group
of
hangings
in
one
of
the
small
rooms
that
looked
out
upon
the
lake
took
his
mind
back
to
his
own
and
the
little
inadequate
but
decidedly
good
bokhara
embroidery
that
dominated
it
like
a
flag
that
lit
it
and
now
lit
his
understanding
like
a
confessed
desire
of
course
lee
happy
woman
was
doing
just
everything
that
marjorie
would
have
loved
to
do
marjorie
had
never
confessed
as
much
perhaps
she
had
never
understood
as
much
but
now
in
the
presence
of
æsthetic
exuberances
trafford
at
least
understood
he
surveyed
the
little
room
whose
harmonies
he
had
at
first
simply
taken
for
granted
noted
the
that
answered
to
the
gleaming
persian
tiles
the
inspiration
of
a
metallic
thread
in
the
hangings
and
the
exquisite
choice
of
the
deadened
paint
upon
the
woodwork
and
realized
for
the
first
time
how
little
aimless
extravagance
can
be
and
all
the
timid
obstinately
insurgent
artistry
that
troubled
his
wife
he
stepped
through
the
open
window
into
a
little
loggia
and
stared
unseeingly
over
glittering
leaves
to
the
mysteries
of
distance
in
the
great
masses
above
gingolph
and
it
seemed
for
the
first
time
that
perhaps
in
his
thoughts
he
had
done
his
wife
a
wrong
he
had
judged
her
fickle
impulsive
erratic
perhaps
merely
because
her
mind
followed
a
different
process
from
his
because
while
he
went
upon
the
lines
of
constructive
truth
her
guide
was
a
more
immediate
and
instinctive
sense
of
beauty
he
was
very
much
alive
to
her
now
and
deeply
in
love
with
her
he
had
reached
les
avants
with
all
his
sense
of
their
discordance
clean
washed
and
walked
out
of
his
mind
by
rain
and
sun
and
a
flow
of
high
resolutions
and
the
brotherly
swing
of
their
strides
together
they
had
come
to
the
lee
villa
comrades
all
unaware
of
the
subtle
differences
of
atmosphere
they
had
to
encounter
they
had
no
suspicion
that
it
was
only
about
half
of
each
other
that
had
fraternized
now
here
they
were
in
a
company
that
was
not
only
altogether
alien
to
their
former
mood
but
extremely
interesting
and
exciting
and
closely
akin
to
the
latent
factors
in
composition
their
hostess
and
her
sister
had
the
keen
quick
æsthetic
sensibilities
of
their
race
with
all
that
freedom
of
reading
and
enfranchisement
of
mind
which
is
the
lot
of
the
western
women
lee
had
an
immense
indulgent
affection
for
his
wife
he
regarded
her
arrangements
and
exploits
with
an
admiration
that
was
almost
american
and
lee
imagination
had
run
loose
in
pursuit
of
beautiful
and
remarkable
people
and
splendours
rather
than
harmonies
of
line
and
colour
lee
like
solomonson
had
that
inexplicable
alchemy
of
mind
which
distils
gold
from
the
commerce
of
the
world
all
this
said
minter
to
trafford
is
an
exhalation
from
all
that
he
accumulated
wealth
as
one
grows
a
beard
and
found
his
interest
in
his
uxorious
satisfactions
and
so
lee
with
her
bright
watchful
eyes
quick
impulsive
movements
and
instinctive
command
had
the
utmost
freedom
to
realize
her
ideals
in
the
world
at
large
lee
and
solomonson
seemed
both
a
little
short
and
a
little
stout
and
a
little
too
black
and
bright
for
their
entirely
conventional
clothing
but
for
the
dinner
and
evening
of
the
villa
they
were
now
out
of
consideration
for
trafford
at
their
ease
and
far
more
dignified
in
oriental
robes
trafford
was
accommodated
with
a
long
black
delicately
embroidered
garment
that
reached
to
his
feet
and
suited
something
upstanding
and
fine
in
his
bearing
minter
who
had
stayed
on
from
an
afternoon
call
was
gorgeous
in
chinese
embroidery
the
rest
of
the
men
clung
boldly
or
bashfully
to
evening
dress
on
the
evening
of
his
arrival
trafford
bathed
and
robed
found
the
rest
of
the
men
assembling
about
an
open
wood
fire
in
the
smaller
hall
at
the
foot
of
the
main
staircase
lee
was
still
upstairs
and
solomonson
with
a
new
grace
of
gesture
begotten
by
his
costume
made
the
necessary
introductions
a
little
man
with
features
and
a
galway
accent
was
rex
the
playwright
a
tall
man
was
bright
from
the
new
york
central
museum
and
a
bearded
giant
with
a
roof
of
red
hair
and
a
remote
eye
was
radlett
barns
the
great
who
consents
to
paint
your
portrait
for
posterity
as
the
king
confers
a
knighthood
these
were
presently
joined
by
lee
and
pacey
the
musician
and
mottersham
whose
patents
and
inventions
control
electric
lighting
and
heating
all
over
the
world
and
then
with
the
men
duly
gathered
and
expectant
the
women
came
down
the
wide
staircase
the
staircase
had
been
planned
and
lit
for
these
effects
and
lee
meant
to
make
the
most
of
her
new
discovery
her
voice
could
be
heard
in
the
unseen
corridor
above
arranging
the
descent
you
go
first
dear
will
you
go
with
christabel
the
conversation
about
the
fire
checked
and
ceased
with
the
sound
of
voices
above
and
the
faint
rustle
of
skirts
then
came
christabel
morrison
her
slender
grace
beautifully
contrasted
with
the
fuller
beauties
of
that
great
lady
of
the
stage
marion
rufus
lady
solomonson
descended
confidently
in
a
group
of
three
with
lady
mottersham
and
little
rex
all
very
rich
and
splendid
after
a
brief
interval
their
hostess
preceded
marjorie
and
was
so
much
of
an
artist
that
she
had
dressed
herself
merely
as
a
foil
to
this
new
creation
she
wore
black
and
scarlet
that
made
the
white
face
and
bright
eyes
under
her
sombre
hair
seem
the
face
of
an
inspiring
spirit
a
step
behind
her
and
to
the
right
of
her
came
marjorie
tall
and
wonderful
as
if
she
were
the
queen
of
earth
and
sunshine
swathed
barbarically
in
gold
and
ruddy
brown
and
with
her
abundant
hair
bound
back
by
a
fillet
of
bloodstones
and
gold
radlett
barns
exclaimed
at
the
sight
of
her
she
was
full
of
the
manifest
consciousness
of
dignity
as
she
descended
quite
conscious
and
quite
unembarrassed
two
borrowed
golden
circlets
glittered
on
her
shining
arm
and
a
thin
chain
of
gold
and
garnets
broke
the
contrast
of
the
warm
neck
above
with
the
unsullied
skin
below
she
sought
and
met
her
husband
astonishment
with
the
faintest
remotest
of
smiles
it
seemed
to
him
that
never
before
had
he
appreciated
her
beauty
his
daily
companion
had
become
this
splendour
in
the
sky
she
came
close
by
him
with
hand
extended
to
greet
sir
philip
mottersham
he
was
sensible
of
the
glow
of
her
as
it
were
of
a
scented
aura
about
her
he
had
a
first
full
intimation
of
the
cult
and
worship
of
woman
and
the
magnificence
of
women
old
as
the
mediterranean
and
its
goddesses
and
altogether
novel
to
his
mind
christabel
morrison
found
him
a
pleasant
but
not
very
entertaining
or
exciting
neighbor
at
the
and
was
relieved
when
the
time
came
for
her
to
turn
an
ear
to
the
artistic
compliments
of
radlett
barns
but
trafford
was
too
interested
and
amused
by
the
general
effect
of
the
dinner
to
devote
himself
to
the
rather
heavy
business
of
really
exhilarating
christabel
he
did
give
his
mind
to
her
he
found
the
transformation
of
sir
rupert
into
a
turbanned
oriental
who
might
have
come
out
of
a
picture
by
carpaccio
gently
stimulating
and
altogether
delightful
his
attention
returned
again
and
again
to
that
genial
swarthiness
lee
on
his
left
lived
in
her
eyes
and
did
so
much
talk
to
him
as
rattle
her
mind
at
him
almost
as
one
might
dangle
keys
at
a
baby
while
one
talked
to
its
mother
yet
it
was
evident
she
liked
the
look
of
him
her
glance
went
from
his
face
to
his
robe
and
up
and
down
the
table
at
the
bright
dresses
the
shining
arms
the
glass
and
light
and
silver
she
asked
him
to
tell
her
just
where
he
had
tramped
and
just
what
he
had
seen
and
he
had
scarcely
begun
answering
her
question
before
her
thoughts
flew
off
to
three
trophies
of
china
and
silver
struggling
groups
of
china
boys
bearing
up
great
silver
shells
of
fruit
and
flowers
that
stood
down
the
centre
of
the
table
what
do
you
think
of
my
chubby
boys
she
asked
german
work
they
came
from
a
show
at
düsseldorf
last
week
ben
saw
i
liked
them
and
sent
back
for
them
secretly
and
here
they
are
i
thought
they
might
be
too
colourless
but
are
they
no
said
trafford
they
just
cool
under
that
glow
of
fruit
is
this
english
cut
glass
old
dutch
said
lee
is
it
jolly
she
embarked
with
a
roving
eye
upon
the
story
of
her
dutch
glass
which
was
abundant
and
admirable
and
broke
off
abruptly
to
say
your
wife
is
wonderful
her
hair
goes
back
she
said
like
music
you
know
what
i
mean
a
sort
of
easy
rhythm
you
do
mind
my
praising
your
wife
trafford
said
he
did
and
there
a
sort
of
dignity
about
her
all
my
life
trafford
i
wanted
to
be
tall
it
stopped
my
growth
she
glanced
off
at
a
tangent
tell
me
trafford
she
asked
was
your
wife
beautiful
like
this
when
you
married
her
i
mean
of
course
she
was
a
beautiful
girl
and
adorable
and
all
that
but
was
she
just
a
slender
thing
she
paused
but
if
she
had
a
habit
of
asking
disconcerting
questions
she
did
not
at
any
rate
insist
upon
answers
and
she
went
on
to
confess
that
she
believed
she
would
be
a
happier
woman
poor
than
rich
not
that
ben
is
all
he
should
be
but
that
then
she
would
have
been
a
fashionable
dressmaker
people
want
help
she
said
so
much
more
help
than
they
get
they
go
about
with
themselves
what
was
it
radlett
barns
said
the
other
night
oh
like
people
leading
horses
they
dare
ride
i
think
he
says
such
good
things
at
times
do
you
so
wonderful
to
be
clever
in
two
ways
like
that
just
look
at
your
wife
now
i
mean
that
they
drawn
that
curtain
behind
her
my
has
been
telling
me
you
keep
the
most
wonderful
and
precious
secrets
locked
up
in
your
breast
that
you
know
how
to
make
gold
and
diamonds
and
all
sorts
of
things
if
i
did
i
should
make
them
she
pounced
suddenly
upon
rex
at
her
left
with
questions
about
the
keltic
renascence
was
it
still
going
on
or
what
and
trafford
was
at
liberty
for
a
time
to
enjoy
the
bright
effects
about
him
the
shadowed
profile
and
black
hair
of
christabel
to
the
right
of
him
and
the
coruscating
refractions
and
reflections
of
lady
solomonson
across
the
white
and
silver
and
ivory
and
blossom
of
the
table
then
lee
dragged
him
into
a
sudden
conflict
with
rex
by
saying
abruptly
of
course
trafford
would
believe
that
he
looked
perhaps
a
little
lost
i
was
telling
lee
said
rex
that
i
do
believe
there
any
economy
of
human
toil
in
machinery
whatever
i
mean
that
the
machine
itself
really
embodies
all
the
toil
it
seems
to
save
toil
that
went
to
the
making
of
it
and
preparing
it
and
getting
coal
for
it
next
morning
they
found
their
hostess
at
breakfast
in
the
and
now
the
sun
was
streaming
through
a
high
triple
window
that
had
been
curtained
overnight
and
they
looked
out
through
clean
bright
upon
mountains
in
a
luminous
mist
and
a
lake
below
great
stone
jars
upon
the
terrace
bore
a
blaze
of
urged
and
early
blossom
and
beyond
were
cypresses
their
hostess
presided
at
one
of
two
round
tables
at
a
side
table
various
breakfast
dishes
kept
warm
over
spirit
lamps
and
two
men
servants
dispensed
tea
and
coffee
in
the
bay
of
the
window
was
a
fruit
table
with
piled
and
lee
waved
a
welcoming
hand
and
drew
marjorie
to
a
seat
beside
her
rex
was
consuming
trout
and
christabel
peaches
and
solomonson
all
his
overnight
orientalism
abandoned
was
in
outspoken
tweeds
and
quite
under
the
impression
that
he
was
interested
in
golf
trafford
got
frizzled
bacon
for
marjorie
and
himself
and
dropped
into
a
desultory
conversation
chiefly
sustained
by
christabel
about
the
peculiarly
exalting
effect
of
beautiful
scenery
on
christabel
mind
lee
was
as
usual
distraught
and
kept
glancing
towards
the
steps
that
led
up
from
the
hall
lady
solomonson
appeared
with
a
rustle
in
a
wrapper
of
pink
chinese
silk
i
came
down
after
all
she
said
i
lay
in
bed
weighing
rolls
and
coffee
and
relaxed
muscles
against
your
english
breakfast
downstairs
and
suddenly
i
remembered
your
little
sausages
she
sat
down
with
a
distribution
of
handkerchief
bag
letters
a
gold
fountain
pen
and
suchlike
equipments
and
trafford
got
her
some
of
the
coveted
delicacies
lee
suddenly
cried
out
they
come
they
come
and
simultaneously
the
hall
resonated
with
voices
and
the
yapping
of
a
skye
terrier
then
a
gay
little
procession
appeared
ascending
the
steps
first
came
a
small
but
princely
little
boy
of
three
with
a
ruddy
face
and
curly
black
hair
behind
him
was
a
slender
rather
awkward
girl
of
perhaps
eleven
and
a
sturdier
daughter
of
israel
of
nine
a
nurse
in
artistic
purple
followed
listening
inattentively
to
some
private
whisperings
of
a
knickerbockered
young
man
of
five
and
then
came
another
nurse
against
contingencies
and
then
a
nurse
of
a
different
and
more
elaborately
costumed
sort
carrying
a
sumptuous
baby
of
eight
or
nine
months
ah
the
cried
christabel
springing
up
quite
beautifully
and
lady
solomonson
echoed
the
cry
the
procession
broke
against
the
tables
and
split
about
the
breakfast
party
the
small
boy
in
petticoats
made
a
confident
rush
for
marjorie
christabel
set
herself
to
fascinate
his
elder
brother
the
young
woman
of
eleven
scrutinized
trafford
with
speculative
interest
and
edged
towards
him
coyly
and
lee
interviewed
her
youngest
born
the
amiable
inanities
suitable
to
the
occasion
had
scarcely
begun
before
a
violent
clapping
of
hands
announced
the
appearance
of
lee
it
was
lee
custom
lee
told
marjorie
over
her
massively
robed
baby
to
get
up
very
early
and
work
on
rolls
and
coffee
he
never
breakfasted
nor
joined
them
until
the
children
came
all
of
them
rushed
to
him
for
their
morning
kiss
and
it
seemed
to
trafford
that
lee
at
least
was
an
altogether
happy
creature
as
he
accepted
the
demonstrative
salutations
of
this
struggling
elbowing
armful
of
offspring
and
emerged
at
last
like
a
man
from
a
dive
flushed
and
ruffled
and
smiling
to
wish
his
adult
guests
good
morning
come
upstairs
with
us
daddy
cried
the
children
tugging
at
him
come
upstairs
lee
ran
her
eye
about
her
table
and
rose
it
the
hour
she
said
to
marjorie
you
do
i
hope
mind
children
but
said
trafford
incredulous
and
with
a
friendly
arm
about
his
admirer
is
this
tall
young
woman
yours
the
child
shot
him
a
glance
of
passionate
appreciation
for
this
scrap
of
flattery
we
began
young
said
lee
with
eyes
of
uncritical
pride
for
the
ungainly
one
and
smiled
at
her
husband
upstairs
cried
the
boy
of
five
and
the
girl
of
nine
upstairs
may
we
come
asked
marjorie
may
we
all
come
asked
christabel
determined
to
be
in
the
movement
rex
strolled
towards
the
cigars
with
disentanglement
obviously
in
his
mind
do
you
really
care
asked
lee
you
know
i
so
proud
of
their
nursery
would
you
care
always
i
go
up
at
this
time
i
my
little
nursery
too
said
marjorie
of
course
cried
lee
i
forgot
of
course
and
overwhelmed
marjorie
with
inquiries
as
she
followed
her
husband
every
one
joined
the
nurseryward
procession
except
rex
who
left
himself
behind
with
an
air
of
inadvertency
and
escaped
to
the
terrace
and
a
cigar
it
was
a
wonderful
nursery
a
suite
of
three
bedrooms
a
green
and
white
schoolroom
and
a
vast
playroom
and
hovering
about
the
passage
trafford
remarked
a
third
purple
nurse
and
a
very
efficient
and
swiss
governess
the
schoolroom
and
the
nursery
displayed
a
triumph
of
judicious
shopping
and
arrangement
the
best
of
german
and
french
and
english
things
had
been
blended
into
a
harmony
at
once
hygienic
and
pedagogic
and
humanly
charming
for
once
marjorie
had
to
admire
the
spending
of
another
woman
and
admit
to
herself
that
even
she
could
not
have
done
better
with
the
money
there
were
clever
little
desks
for
the
elder
children
to
work
at
adjustable
desks
scientifically
lit
so
that
they
benefited
hands
and
shoulders
and
eyes
there
were
artistically
coloured
and
artistically
arranged
pictures
and
a
little
library
held
all
the
best
of
lang
and
lucas
rare
good
things
like
uncle
lubin
maurice
baring
story
of
johnny
crow
garden
the
bad
child
book
of
beasts
animal
books
and
bird
books
costume
books
and
story
books
colour
books
and
rhyme
books
abundant
yet
every
one
intelligently
chosen
no
costly
meretricious
printed
rubbish
such
as
silly
gentile
mothers
buy
then
in
the
great
nursery
with
its
cork
carpet
on
which
any
toy
would
stand
or
run
was
an
abundance
of
admirable
possessions
and
shelving
for
everything
and
great
fat
cloth
elephants
to
ride
and
and
hooks
for
a
swing
marjorie
quick
eye
saw
and
she
admired
effusively
and
envied
secretly
and
lee
appreciated
her
appreciation
a
skirmishing
romp
of
the
middle
children
and
lee
went
on
about
the
two
of
them
and
trafford
was
led
off
by
his
admirer
into
a
in
one
corner
with
real
glass
windows
made
to
open
and
the
muslin
curtains
were
drawn
while
he
was
shown
a
secret
under
vows
lady
solomonson
discovered
some
soldiers
and
was
presently
on
her
knees
in
a
corner
with
the
old
boy
these
are
like
my
teddy
she
was
saying
my
billy
has
some
of
these
trafford
emerged
from
the
which
was
perhaps
a
little
cramped
for
him
and
surveyed
the
room
with
his
admirer
lugging
at
his
arm
unheeded
and
whispering
come
back
with
me
of
course
this
was
the
clue
to
lee
and
solomonson
how
extremely
happy
lee
appeared
to
be
enormous
vistas
of
dark
philoprogenitive
parents
and
healthy
little
jews
and
jewesses
seemed
to
open
out
to
trafford
hygienically
reared
exquisitely
trained
and
educated
and
he
and
marjorie
had
just
one
little
daughter
with
a
much
poorer
educational
outlook
she
had
no
cloth
elephant
to
ride
no
elaborate
to
get
into
only
a
picture
books
or
so
and
later
she
when
she
needed
it
get
that
linguistic
swiss
he
was
above
the
normal
human
vanity
of
esteeming
his
own
race
and
type
the
best
and
certain
vulgar
aspects
of
what
nowadays
one
calls
eugenics
crossed
his
mind
during
those
few
crowded
days
of
unfamiliar
living
trafford
accumulated
a
vast
confused
mass
of
thoughts
and
impressions
he
realized
acutely
the
enormous
gulf
between
his
attitudes
towards
women
and
those
of
his
host
and
solomonson
and
indeed
of
all
the
other
men
it
had
never
occurred
to
him
before
that
there
was
any
other
relationship
possible
between
a
modern
woman
and
a
modern
man
but
a
frank
comradeship
and
perfect
knowledge
helpfulness
and
honesty
that
had
been
the
continual
implication
of
his
mother
life
and
of
all
that
he
had
respected
in
the
thought
and
writing
of
his
time
but
not
one
of
these
men
in
their
place
with
the
possible
exception
of
minter
who
remained
brilliant
but
ambiguous
believed
anything
of
the
sort
it
necessarily
involved
in
practice
a
share
of
hardship
for
women
and
it
seemed
fundamental
to
them
that
women
should
have
no
hardship
he
sought
for
a
word
and
hung
between
chivalry
and
orientalism
he
inclined
towards
chivalry
their
women
were
lifted
a
little
off
the
cold
ground
of
responsibility
charm
was
their
obligation
a
beautiful
woman
should
be
beautifully
dressed
said
radlett
barns
in
the
course
of
the
discussion
of
a
contemporary
portrait
painter
lee
nodded
to
endorse
an
obvious
truth
but
she
ought
to
dress
herself
said
barns
it
ought
to
be
herself
to
the
points
of
the
old
lace
chosen
and
assimilated
it
just
through
not
being
that
that
so
many
rich
women
are
detestable
heaps
of
acquisition
trafford
ceased
to
listen
he
helped
himself
to
a
cigar
and
pinched
its
end
and
lit
it
while
his
mind
went
off
to
gnaw
at
a
beautiful
woman
should
be
beautifully
dressed
as
a
dog
retires
with
a
bone
he
could
escape
from
its
shining
truth
and
withal
it
was
devastating
to
all
the
purposes
of
his
life
he
rejected
the
word
orientalism
what
he
was
dealing
with
here
was
chivalry
all
this
was
indeed
under
the
thinnest
of
disguises
the
castle
and
the
pavilion
and
lee
and
solomonson
were
valiant
knights
who
entered
the
lists
not
indeed
with
spear
and
shield
but
with
prospectus
and
ingenious
enterprise
who
drew
cheques
instead
of
swords
for
their
ladies
honour
who
held
all
that
in
fee
and
subjection
that
these
exquisite
and
wonderful
beings
should
flower
in
rich
perfection
all
these
women
lived
in
a
magic
security
and
abundance
far
above
the
mire
and
adventure
of
the
world
their
knights
went
upon
quests
for
them
and
returned
with
villas
and
pictures
and
diamonds
and
historical
pearls
and
not
one
of
them
all
was
so
beautiful
a
being
as
his
marjorie
whom
he
made
his
squaw
whom
he
expected
to
aid
and
follow
him
and
suffer
uncomplainingly
the
rough
services
of
the
common
life
not
one
was
half
so
beautiful
as
marjorie
nor
half
so
sweet
and
wonderful
if
such
thoughts
came
in
lee
villa
they
returned
with
redoubled
force
when
trafford
found
himself
packed
painfully
with
marjorie
in
the
night
train
to
paris
his
head
ached
with
the
rattle
and
suffocation
of
the
train
and
he
knew
hers
must
ache
more
the
windows
of
the
compartment
and
the
door
were
all
closed
the
litigious
little
commercial
traveller
in
shiny
grey
had
insisted
upon
that
there
was
no
corner
seat
either
for
marjorie
or
himself
the
dim
big
package
over
her
head
swayed
threateningly
the
green
shade
over
the
light
kept
opening
with
the
vibration
of
the
train
the
pallid
old
gentleman
with
the
beard
had
twisted
himself
into
a
ghastly
resemblance
to
a
corpse
and
pressed
his
knees
hard
and
stiffly
against
trafford
and
the
small
sniffing
little
boy
beside
the
rusty
widow
woman
in
the
corner
smelt
mysteriously
and
penetratingly
of
roquefort
cheese
for
the
seventeenth
time
the
little
commercial
traveller
jumped
up
with
an
unbecoming
expletive
and
pulled
the
shade
over
the
light
and
the
silent
young
man
in
the
fourth
corner
stirred
and
readjusted
his
legs
for
a
time
until
the
crack
of
light
overhead
had
widened
again
every
one
became
a
dark
outline
he
watched
the
dim
shape
before
him
and
noted
the
weary
droop
of
her
pose
he
wished
he
had
brought
water
he
was
intolerably
thirsty
and
his
thirst
gave
him
the
measure
of
hers
this
jolting
foetid
compartment
was
a
horrible
place
for
her
an
intolerably
horrible
place
and
she
was
standing
it
for
all
her
manifest
suffering
with
infinite
gallantry
and
patience
what
a
gallant
soul
indeed
she
was
whatever
else
she
did
she
never
failed
to
rise
to
a
challenge
her
very
extravagance
that
had
tried
their
lives
so
sorely
was
perhaps
just
one
aspect
of
that
same
quality
it
is
so
easy
to
be
saving
if
one
is
timid
so
hard
if
one
is
unaccustomed
to
fear
how
beautiful
she
had
shone
at
times
in
the
lights
and
glitter
of
that
house
behind
there
and
now
she
was
back
in
her
tweeds
again
like
a
shining
sword
thrust
back
into
a
rusty
old
sheath
was
it
fair
that
she
should
come
back
into
the
sheath
because
of
this
passion
of
his
for
a
vast
inexhaustible
research
he
had
never
asked
himself
before
if
it
was
fair
to
assume
she
would
follow
his
purpose
and
his
fortunes
he
had
taken
that
for
granted
and
she
too
had
taken
that
for
granted
which
was
so
generously
splendid
of
her
all
her
disloyalties
had
been
unintentional
indeed
almost
instinctive
breaches
of
her
subordination
to
this
aim
which
was
his
alone
these
breaches
he
realized
had
been
the
reality
of
her
nature
fighting
against
her
profoundest
resolutions
he
wondered
what
lee
must
think
of
this
sort
of
married
life
how
ugly
and
selfish
it
must
seem
from
that
point
of
view
he
perceived
for
the
first
time
the
fundamental
incongruity
of
marjorie
position
she
was
made
to
shine
elaborately
prepared
and
trained
to
shine
desiring
keenly
to
shine
and
then
imprisoned
and
hidden
in
the
faded
obscurity
of
a
small
poor
home
how
conspicuously
how
extremely
he
must
be
wanting
in
just
that
sort
of
chivalry
in
which
lee
excelled
those
business
men
lived
for
their
women
to
an
extent
he
had
hitherto
scarcely
dreamt
of
doing
his
want
of
chivalry
was
beyond
dispute
and
was
there
not
also
an
extraordinary
egotism
in
this
concentration
upon
his
own
purposes
a
a
vanity
had
her
life
no
rights
suppose
now
he
were
to
give
her
two
years
three
years
perhaps
of
his
life
altogether
or
even
four
was
it
too
much
to
grudge
her
four
solomonson
had
been
at
his
old
theme
with
him
a
theme
the
little
man
had
never
relinquished
since
their
friendship
first
began
years
ago
possibilities
of
a
business
alliance
and
the
application
of
a
mind
of
exceptional
freshness
and
penetration
to
industrial
development
why
should
that
be
tried
why
not
make
money
for
a
brief
strenuous
time
and
then
come
back
when
marjorie
pride
and
comfort
were
secure
poor
dear
how
weary
she
looked
he
wondered
how
much
more
remained
of
this
appalling
night
it
would
have
made
so
little
difference
if
they
had
taken
the
day
train
and
travelled
was
she
indeed
entitled
to
travel
pictures
of
the
immense
spaciousness
the
softness
cleanliness
and
dignity
of
compartments
appeared
in
his
mind
he
would
have
looked
at
his
watch
but
to
get
at
it
would
mean
disturbing
the
silent
young
man
on
his
left
outside
in
the
corridor
there
broke
out
a
noisy
dispute
about
a
missing
coupon
a
dispute
in
that
wonderful
language
that
is
known
to
the
facetious
as
between
an
englishman
and
the
conductor
of
the
train
in
paris
there
was
a
dispute
with
an
extortionate
cabman
and
the
crossing
from
dieppe
to
newhaven
was
rough
and
bitterly
cold
they
were
both
ill
they
reached
home
very
dirty
and
weary
and
among
the
pile
of
letters
and
papers
on
trafford
desk
was
a
big
bundle
of
science
note
proofs
and
two
letters
from
croydon
and
pinner
to
alter
the
hours
of
his
lectures
for
various
plausible
and
irritating
reasons
the
little
passage
looked
very
small
and
rather
bare
as
the
door
shut
behind
them
and
the
worn
places
that
had
begun
to
be
conspicuous
during
the
last
six
months
and
which
they
had
forgotten
during
the
swiss
holiday
reasserted
themselves
the
after
spacious
rooms
flooded
with
sunshine
betrayed
how
dark
it
was
and
how
small
those
bokhara
embroideries
that
had
once
shone
so
splendid
now
after
lee
rich
and
unlimited
harmonies
seemed
skimpy
and
insufficient
mere
for
the
artistic
nakedness
of
the
home
they
felt
too
they
were
beginning
to
find
out
their
picture
they
had
not
remembered
it
as
nearly
so
crude
as
it
now
appeared
the
hole
a
flying
coal
had
burnt
in
the
unevenly
faded
carpet
looked
larger
than
it
had
ever
done
before
and
was
indeed
the
only
thing
that
did
appear
faded
and
shrunken
the
atmosphere
of
the
lees
villa
had
disturbed
marjorie
feelings
and
ideas
even
more
than
it
had
trafford
she
came
back
struggling
to
recover
those
high
resolves
that
had
seemed
so
secure
when
they
had
walked
down
to
les
avantes
there
was
a
curiously
tormenting
memory
of
that
vast
admirable
nursery
and
the
princely
procession
of
children
that
would
not
leave
her
mind
no
effort
of
her
reason
could
reconcile
her
to
the
inferiority
of
margharita
equipment
she
had
a
detestable
craving
for
a
uniform
for
may
but
may
was
going
but
indeed
she
was
not
so
sure
that
may
was
going
she
was
no
longer
buoyantly
well
she
was
full
of
indefinable
apprehensions
of
weakness
and
failure
she
struggled
to
control
an
insurgence
of
emotions
that
rose
out
of
the
deeps
of
her
being
she
had
now
she
knew
to
take
on
her
share
of
the
burden
to
become
one
of
the
samurai
to
show
her
love
no
longer
as
a
demand
but
as
a
service
yet
from
day
to
day
she
procrastinated
under
the
shadow
of
apprehended
things
she
forebore
to
dismiss
may
to
buy
that
typewriter
she
needed
to
take
any
irrevocable
step
towards
the
realization
of
the
new
way
of
living
she
tried
to
think
away
her
fears
but
they
would
not
leave
her
she
felt
that
trafford
watched
her
pale
face
with
a
furtive
solicitude
and
wondered
at
her
hesitations
she
tried
in
vain
to
seem
cheerful
and
careless
in
his
presence
with
an
anxiety
with
premonitions
that
grew
daily
there
was
no
need
to
worry
him
unduly
but
soon
the
matter
was
beyond
all
doubting
one
night
she
gathered
her
courage
together
suddenly
and
came
down
into
his
study
in
her
with
her
hair
about
her
shoulders
she
opened
the
door
and
her
heart
failed
her
rag
she
whispered
yes
he
said
busily
from
his
desk
without
looking
round
i
want
to
speak
to
you
she
answered
and
came
slowly
and
stood
beside
him
silently
well
old
marjorie
he
said
presently
drawing
a
little
intricate
pattern
in
the
corner
of
his
blotting
paper
and
wondering
whether
this
was
a
matter
of
five
pounds
or
ten
i
meant
so
well
she
said
and
caught
herself
back
into
silence
again
he
started
at
the
thought
at
a
depth
and
meaning
in
her
voice
turned
his
chair
about
to
look
at
her
and
discovered
she
was
weeping
and
choking
noiselessly
he
stood
up
close
to
her
moving
very
slowly
and
silently
his
eyes
full
of
this
new
surmise
and
now
without
word
or
gesture
from
her
he
knew
his
thought
was
right
my
dear
he
whispered
she
turned
her
face
from
him
i
meant
so
well
she
sobbed
my
dear
i
meant
so
well
still
with
an
averted
face
her
arms
came
out
to
him
in
a
desperate
unreasoning
appeal
for
love
he
took
her
and
held
her
close
to
him
never
mind
dear
he
said
do
mind
her
passion
now
was
unconstrained
i
thought
he
began
and
left
the
thing
unsaid
but
your
work
she
said
your
research
i
must
give
up
research
he
said
oh
my
dearest
i
must
give
up
research
he
repeated
i
been
seeing
it
for
days
clearer
and
clearer
dear
just
settles
things
even
as
we
were
coming
home
in
the
train
i
was
making
up
my
mind
at
vevey
i
was
talking
to
solomonson
my
dear
she
whispered
clinging
to
him
i
talked
to
solomonson
he
had
ideas
a
proposal
no
she
said
yes
he
said
i
left
the
thing
too
long
he
repeated
i
must
give
up
research
for
years
i
ought
to
have
done
it
long
before
i
had
meant
so
well
she
said
i
meant
to
work
i
meant
to
deny
myself
i
glad
he
whispered
glad
why
should
you
weep
it
seemed
nothing
to
him
then
that
so
he
should
take
a
long
farewell
to
the
rare
sweet
air
of
that
wonderland
his
mind
had
loved
so
dearly
all
he
remembered
was
that
marjorie
was
very
dear
to
him
very
dear
to
him
and
that
all
her
being
was
now
calling
out
for
him
and
his
strength
i
had
thought
anyhow
of
giving
up
research
he
repeated
this
merely
decides
it
happens
to
decide
i
love
you
dear
i
put
my
research
at
your
feet
gladly
this
is
the
end
and
i
do
not
care
my
dear
at
all
i
do
not
care
at
all
seeing
i
have
you
he
stood
beside
her
for
a
moment
and
then
sat
down
again
sideways
upon
his
chair
it
is
you
my
dear
or
me
he
said
but
life
that
beats
us
that
beautiful
irrational
mother
life
does
not
care
for
research
or
knowledge
but
only
for
life
oh
the
world
has
to
go
on
yet
for
tens
of
thousands
of
years
before
before
we
are
free
for
that
i
got
to
fight
as
other
men
fight
he
thought
in
silence
for
a
time
oddly
regardless
of
her
but
if
it
was
not
you
he
said
staring
at
the
fireplace
with
knitted
brows
if
i
did
not
love
you
thank
god
i
love
you
dear
thank
god
our
children
are
love
children
i
want
to
live
to
my
but
if
i
did
love
you
oh
love
you
then
i
think
now
i
be
glad
i
be
glad
i
think
to
cheat
life
of
her
victory
oh
my
dear
she
cried
and
clung
weeping
to
him
and
caught
at
him
and
sat
herself
upon
his
knees
and
put
her
arms
about
his
head
and
kissed
him
passionately
with
lips
with
her
hair
falling
upon
his
face
my
dear
she
whispered
so
soon
as
trafford
could
spare
an
afternoon
amidst
his
crowded
engagements
he
went
to
talk
to
solomonson
who
was
now
back
in
london
solomonson
he
said
you
were
talking
about
rubber
at
vevey
i
remember
said
solomonson
with
a
note
of
welcome
i
thought
it
over
i
you
would
i
thought
things
over
i
going
to
give
up
my
professorship
and
science
generally
and
come
into
business
if
that
is
what
you
are
meaning
solomonson
turned
his
round
very
carefully
before
replying
then
he
said
you
must
give
up
your
professorship
yet
trafford
for
the
rest
i
glad
he
reflected
and
then
his
bright
eyes
glanced
up
at
trafford
i
knew
he
said
you
would
i
did
said
trafford
things
have
happened
since
something
was
bound
to
happen
you
too
good
for
what
it
gave
you
i
did
talk
to
you
out
there
for
nothing
i
saw
things
let
go
into
the
other
room
and
smoke
and
talk
it
over
he
stood
up
as
he
spoke
i
thought
you
would
he
repeated
leading
the
way
i
knew
you
would
you
see
one
to
you
ca
get
out
of
it
it
was
all
very
well
before
you
were
married
said
solomonson
stopping
short
to
say
it
but
when
a
man
married
he
got
to
think
he
ca
go
on
devoting
himself
to
his
art
and
his
science
and
all
that
not
if
he
married
anything
worth
having
no
oh
i
understand
he
got
to
look
about
him
and
forget
the
distant
prospect
for
a
bit
i
saw
you
come
to
it
came
to
it
had
to
i
had
ambitions
just
as
you
have
i
always
had
an
inclination
to
do
a
bit
of
research
on
my
own
i
it
you
know
oh
i
could
have
done
things
i
sure
i
could
have
done
things
i
not
a
born
but
he
became
very
close
and
confidential
it
you
said
to
science
for
a
bit
when
you
flopped
me
down
on
that
old
trafford
he
went
off
to
reminiscences
lord
how
we
went
over
no
more
aviation
for
me
trafford
he
arranged
chairs
and
produced
cigars
after
all
this
of
course
it
interesting
once
you
get
into
the
movement
of
it
it
takes
hold
of
you
it
a
game
i
thought
over
all
you
said
trafford
began
using
premeditated
phrases
bluntly
i
want
three
thousand
a
year
and
i
do
make
eight
hundred
it
come
home
to
me
i
going
to
have
another
child
solomonson
gesticulated
a
congratulation
all
the
same
i
hate
dropping
research
it
stuff
i
made
to
do
about
that
solomonson
i
almost
superstitious
i
could
say
i
had
a
call
it
the
maddest
state
of
affairs
now
that
i
doing
absolutely
my
best
work
for
mankind
work
i
firmly
believe
no
one
else
can
do
i
just
manage
to
get
six
hundred
nearly
two
hundred
of
my
eight
hundred
is
my
own
what
does
the
world
think
i
could
do
better
that
would
be
worth
four
times
as
much
the
world
does
think
anything
at
all
about
it
said
solomonson
suppose
it
did
the
thought
struck
sir
rupert
he
knitted
his
brows
and
looked
hard
obliquely
at
the
smoke
of
his
cigar
oh
it
wo
he
said
rejecting
a
disagreeable
idea
there
is
any
world
not
in
that
sense
the
mistake
you
make
trafford
it
not
what
your
work
is
worth
he
explained
it
what
your
advantages
can
get
for
you
people
are
always
going
about
supposing
just
what
you
suppose
that
people
ought
to
get
paid
in
proportion
to
the
good
they
do
it
forgetting
what
the
world
is
to
do
that
very
likely
some
day
civilization
will
get
to
that
but
it
got
to
it
yet
it
is
going
to
get
to
it
for
hundreds
and
hundreds
of
years
his
manner
became
confidential
civilization
just
a
fight
trafford
just
as
savagery
is
a
fight
and
being
a
wild
beast
is
a
fight
only
you
have
paddeder
gloves
on
and
there
more
rules
we
are
out
for
everybody
we
out
for
ourselves
and
a
few
friends
perhaps
within
limits
it
no
good
hurrying
ahead
and
pretending
civilization
something
else
when
it
is
that
where
all
these
socialists
and
people
come
a
howler
oh
know
the
socialists
i
see
at
my
wife
at
homes
they
come
along
with
the
literary
people
and
the
artists
wives
and
the
actors
and
actresses
and
none
of
them
take
much
account
of
me
because
i
just
a
business
man
and
rather
dark
and
short
and
so
i
get
a
chance
of
looking
at
them
from
the
side
that
on
show
while
the
other
turned
to
the
women
and
they
just
as
fighting
as
the
rest
of
us
only
they
humbug
more
and
they
do
seem
to
me
to
have
a
decent
respect
for
any
of
the
common
rules
and
about
what
it
all
comes
to
trafford
sir
rupert
paused
and
trafford
was
about
to
speak
when
the
former
resumed
again
his
voice
very
earnest
his
eyes
shining
with
purpose
he
liked
trafford
and
he
was
doing
his
utmost
to
make
a
convincing
confession
of
the
faith
that
was
in
him
it
when
it
comes
to
the
women
said
sir
rupert
that
one
finds
it
out
that
where
found
it
out
you
say
i
going
to
devote
my
life
to
the
service
of
humanity
in
general
you
find
humanity
in
particular
in
the
shape
of
all
the
fine
beautiful
delightful
and
desirable
women
you
come
across
preferring
a
narrower
turn
of
devotion
see
that
all
of
course
that
what
i
found
out
and
that
what
found
out
and
that
what
everybody
with
any
sense
in
his
head
finds
out
and
there
you
are
you
put
it
graphically
said
trafford
i
feel
it
graphically
i
may
be
all
sorts
of
things
but
i
do
know
a
fact
when
i
see
it
i
here
with
a
few
things
i
want
and
a
woman
or
so
i
have
and
want
to
keep
and
the
kids
upstairs
bless
and
i
in
league
with
all
the
others
who
want
the
same
sort
of
things
against
any
one
or
anything
that
upsets
us
we
stand
by
the
law
and
each
other
and
that
what
it
all
amounts
to
that
as
far
as
my
patch
of
humanity
goes
humanity
at
large
humanity
be
blowed
at
it
it
is
that
i
hostile
to
humanity
mind
you
but
that
i
not
disposed
to
go
under
as
i
should
do
if
i
did
say
that
so
i
say
it
and
that
about
all
it
is
and
there
you
are
he
regarded
trafford
over
his
cigar
drawing
fiercely
at
it
for
some
moments
then
seeing
trafford
on
the
point
of
speaking
he
snatched
it
from
his
lips
demanded
silence
by
waving
it
at
his
hearer
and
went
on
i
say
all
this
in
order
to
dispose
of
any
idea
that
you
can
keep
up
the
scientific
attitude
if
you
come
into
business
you
ca
put
business
in
two
words
and
what
is
it
keeping
something
from
somebody
else
and
making
him
pay
for
it
oh
look
here
protested
trafford
that
not
the
whole
of
business
there
making
him
want
it
of
course
advertisement
and
all
that
but
that
falls
under
making
him
pay
for
it
really
but
a
business
man
organizes
public
services
consolidates
economizes
sir
rupert
made
his
mouth
look
very
wide
by
sucking
in
the
corners
incidentally
he
said
and
added
after
a
judicious
pause
sometimes
i
thought
we
were
talking
of
making
money
go
on
said
trafford
you
set
me
thinking
said
solomonson
it
the
thing
i
always
like
about
you
i
tell
you
trafford
i
do
believe
that
the
majority
of
people
who
make
money
help
civilization
forward
any
more
than
the
smoke
that
comes
out
of
the
engine
helps
the
train
forward
if
you
put
it
to
me
i
do
i
got
no
illusions
of
that
sort
they
about
as
much
help
as
fat
they
accumulate
because
things
happen
to
be
arranged
so
things
will
be
arranged
better
some
day
they
are
arranged
better
now
grip
that
it
a
sort
of
paradox
if
you
got
big
gifts
and
you
choose
to
help
forward
the
world
if
you
choose
to
tell
all
you
know
and
give
away
everything
you
can
do
in
the
way
of
work
you
got
to
give
up
the
ideas
of
wealth
and
security
and
that
means
fine
women
and
children
you
got
to
be
a
sort
of
man
right
you
say
me
but
how
about
your
wife
being
a
deprived
sort
of
woman
eh
that
where
it
gets
you
and
meanwhile
you
know
while
make
your
sacrifices
and
do
your
researches
there
be
little
mean
sharp
active
beasts
making
money
all
over
you
like
maggots
on
a
cheese
and
if
everybody
who
got
gifts
and
altruistic
ideas
gave
themselves
up
to
it
then
evidently
only
the
mean
and
greedy
lot
would
breed
and
have
the
glory
they
get
everything
every
blessed
thing
there
would
be
an
option
they
did
hold
and
the
other
chaps
would
produce
the
art
and
the
science
and
the
literature
as
far
as
the
men
who
got
hold
of
things
would
let
and
perish
out
of
the
earth
altogether
there
you
are
still
how
things
are
made
but
it
is
worth
it
it
is
worth
extinguishing
oneself
in
order
to
make
a
world
for
those
others
anyhow
them
and
their
children
is
it
eh
it
like
building
a
temple
for
flies
to
buzz
in
there
is
such
a
thing
as
a
personal
side
to
eugenics
you
know
solomonson
reflected
over
the
end
of
his
cigar
it
is
good
enough
he
concluded
you
infernally
right
said
trafford
very
well
said
solomonson
and
now
we
can
get
to
business
the
immediate
business
was
the
systematic
exploitation
of
the
fact
that
trafford
had
worked
out
the
problem
of
synthesizing
indiarubber
he
had
done
so
with
an
entire
indifference
to
the
commercial
possibilities
of
the
case
because
he
had
been
irritated
by
the
enormous
publicity
given
to
behrens
assertion
that
he
had
achieved
this
end
of
course
the
production
of
artificial
rubbers
and
substances
had
been
one
of
the
activities
of
the
synthetic
chemist
for
many
years
from
the
appearance
of
tilden
isoprene
rubber
onward
and
there
was
already
a
formidable
list
of
collaterals
dimethybutadiene
and
so
forth
by
which
the
coveted
goal
could
be
approached
behrens
had
boldly
added
to
this
list
as
his
own
a
number
of
variations
upon
a
theme
of
trafford
originally
designed
to
settle
certain
curiosities
about
elasticity
behrens
products
were
not
only
more
massively
than
anything
that
had
gone
before
them
but
also
extremely
cheap
to
produce
and
his
bold
announcement
of
success
had
produced
a
check
in
rubber
sales
and
widespread
depression
in
the
quiveringly
sensitive
market
of
plantation
shares
solomonson
had
consulted
trafford
about
this
matter
at
vevey
and
had
heard
with
infinite
astonishment
that
trafford
had
already
roughly
prepared
and
was
proposing
to
complete
and
publish
unpatented
and
absolutely
unprotected
first
a
smashing
demonstration
of
the
unsoundness
of
behrens
claim
and
then
a
lucid
exposition
of
just
what
had
to
be
done
and
what
could
be
done
to
make
an
indiarubber
absolutely
indistinguishable
from
the
natural
product
the
business
man
could
not
believe
his
ears
my
dear
chap
positively
you
must
solomonson
had
screamed
and
he
had
opened
his
fingers
and
humped
his
shoulders
and
for
all
his
public
school
and
university
training
lapsed
undisguisedly
into
the
oriental
do
you
all
you
are
throwing
away
he
squealed
i
suppose
it
our
quality
to
throw
such
things
away
said
trafford
when
at
last
solomonson
point
of
view
became
clear
to
him
they
had
embarked
upon
a
long
rambling
discussion
of
that
issue
of
publication
a
discussion
they
were
now
taking
up
again
when
men
dropped
that
idea
of
concealing
knowledge
alchemist
gave
place
to
chemist
said
trafford
and
all
that
is
worth
having
in
modern
life
all
that
makes
it
better
and
safer
and
more
hopeful
than
the
ancient
life
began
my
dear
fellow
said
solomonson
i
know
i
know
but
to
give
away
the
synthesis
of
rubber
to
just
shove
it
out
of
the
window
into
the
street
o
and
when
you
could
do
with
so
much
too
now
they
resumed
the
divergent
threads
of
that
vevey
talk
solomonson
had
always
entertained
the
warmest
friendship
and
admiration
for
trafford
and
it
was
no
new
thing
that
he
should
desire
a
business
he
had
been
working
for
that
in
the
old
days
at
riplings
he
had
never
altogether
let
the
possibility
drop
out
of
sight
between
them
in
spite
of
trafford
repudiations
he
believed
himself
to
be
a
scientific
man
turned
to
business
but
indeed
his
whole
passion
was
for
organization
and
finance
he
knew
he
could
do
everything
but
originate
and
in
trafford
he
recognized
just
that
rare
combination
of
an
obstinate
and
penetrating
simplicity
with
constructive
power
which
is
the
essential
blend
in
the
making
of
great
intellectual
initiatives
to
trafford
belonged
the
secret
of
novel
and
unsuspected
solutions
what
were
fixed
barriers
and
unsurmountable
conditions
to
trained
investigators
and
commonplace
minds
would
yield
to
his
gift
of
magic
inquiry
he
could
startle
the
accepted
error
into
other
men
might
play
the
game
of
business
infinitely
better
than
he
solomonson
knew
indeed
quite
well
that
he
himself
could
play
the
game
infinitely
better
than
trafford
but
it
rested
with
trafford
by
right
divine
of
genius
to
alter
the
rules
if
only
he
could
be
induced
to
alter
the
rules
secretly
unostentatiously
on
a
business
footing
instead
of
making
catastrophic
plunges
into
publicity
and
everything
that
had
made
trafford
up
to
the
day
of
his
marriage
was
antagonistic
to
such
strategic
reservations
the
servant
of
science
has
as
such
no
concern
with
personal
consequences
his
business
is
the
steady
relentless
clarification
of
knowledge
the
human
affairs
he
changes
the
wealth
he
makes
or
destroys
are
no
concern
of
his
once
these
things
weigh
with
him
become
primary
he
has
lost
his
honour
as
a
scientific
man
but
you
think
of
consequences
solomonson
had
cried
during
those
intermittent
talks
at
vevey
here
you
are
shying
this
cheap
synthetic
rubber
of
yours
into
the
world
for
it
bound
to
be
cheap
any
one
can
see
that
like
a
bomb
into
a
what
the
good
of
saying
you
do
care
about
the
that
business
is
just
to
make
bombs
and
drop
them
out
of
the
window
you
smash
up
things
just
the
same
why
you
ruin
hundreds
and
thousands
of
people
people
living
on
rubber
shares
people
working
in
plantations
old
inadaptable
workers
in
rubber
works
sir
rupert
was
now
still
a
little
incredulous
of
trafford
change
of
purpose
and
for
a
time
argued
conceded
points
then
slowly
he
came
to
the
conditions
and
methods
of
the
new
relationship
he
sketched
out
a
scheme
of
and
understandings
between
his
firm
and
trafford
between
them
both
and
his
associated
group
in
the
city
behrens
was
to
have
rope
and
produce
his
slump
in
plantation
shares
then
trafford
was
to
publish
his
criticism
of
behrens
reserving
only
that
catalytic
process
which
was
his
own
originality
the
process
that
was
to
convert
the
inert
theoretically
correct
synthetic
rubber
with
a
mysterious
difference
in
the
quality
of
its
phases
into
the
real
right
thing
with
behrens
exploded
plantation
shares
would
recover
and
while
their
friends
in
the
city
manipulated
that
trafford
would
resign
his
professorship
and
engage
himself
to
an
ostentatious
promotion
syndicate
for
the
investigation
of
synthetic
rubber
his
discovery
would
follow
immediately
the
group
had
cleared
itself
of
plantation
shares
indeed
he
could
begin
planning
the
necessary
works
forthwith
the
large
scale
operations
in
the
process
were
to
be
protected
as
far
as
possible
by
patents
but
its
essential
feature
the
addition
of
a
specific
catalytic
agent
could
be
safely
dealt
with
as
a
secret
process
i
hate
secrecy
said
trafford
business
interjected
solomonson
and
went
on
with
his
exposition
of
the
relative
advantages
of
secrecy
and
patent
rights
it
was
all
a
matter
of
just
how
many
people
you
had
to
trust
as
that
number
increased
the
more
and
more
advisable
did
it
become
to
put
your
cards
on
the
table
and
risk
the
complex
uncertain
protection
of
the
patent
law
they
went
into
elaborate
calculations
clerks
were
called
upon
to
hunt
up
facts
and
prices
and
the
table
was
presently
littered
with
waste
arithmetic
i
believe
we
can
do
the
stuff
at
tenpence
a
pound
said
solomonson
leaning
back
in
his
chair
at
last
and
rattling
his
fountain
pen
between
his
teeth
so
soon
that
is
as
we
deal
in
quantity
tenpence
we
can
lower
the
price
and
spread
the
market
sixpence
by
sixpence
in
the
end
there
wo
be
any
more
plantations
have
to
grow
tea
i
say
let
have
an
invalid
dinner
of
chicken
and
champagne
and
go
on
with
this
it
fascinating
you
can
telephone
they
dined
together
and
solomonson
on
champagne
rather
than
chicken
his
mind
which
had
never
shown
an
instant
fatigue
began
to
glow
and
sparkle
this
enterprise
he
declared
was
to
be
only
the
first
of
a
series
of
vigorous
exploitations
the
whole
thing
warmed
him
he
would
rather
make
ten
thousand
by
such
developments
than
a
hundred
thousand
by
mere
speculation
trafford
had
but
scratched
the
surface
of
his
mine
of
knowledge
let
think
of
other
things
said
sir
rupert
solomonson
diamonds
no
they
got
too
many
tons
stowed
away
already
a
diamond
now
it
an
absolutely
artificial
value
at
any
time
a
new
discovery
and
one
wild
proprietor
might
bust
that
show
lord
diamonds
metals
of
course
you
worked
the
colloids
chiefly
i
suppose
there
been
more
done
in
metals
and
alloys
than
anywhere
there
a
lot
of
other
substances
business
has
hardly
begun
to
touch
substances
yet
you
know
trafford
flexible
glass
for
example
and
things
like
that
so
far
we
always
taken
substances
for
granted
on
our
side
i
mean
extraordinary
how
narrow
the
outlook
of
business
and
finance
is
still
it
never
seems
to
lead
to
things
never
thinks
ahead
in
this
case
of
rubber
for
example
when
men
fight
for
their
own
hands
and
for
profit
and
position
in
the
next
ten
years
or
so
i
suppose
they
tend
to
become
narrow
i
suppose
they
must
sir
rupert
face
glowed
with
a
new
idea
and
his
voice
dropped
a
little
lower
but
what
a
pull
they
get
trafford
if
perhaps
they
do
eh
no
said
trafford
with
a
smile
and
a
sigh
the
other
sort
gets
the
pull
not
time
said
solomonson
not
with
you
to
spot
processes
and
me
to
figure
out
the
cost
he
waved
his
hands
to
the
litter
that
had
been
removed
to
a
side
table
and
generally
see
how
the
business
end
of
things
is
going
book
the
third
marjorie
at
lonely
hut
chapter
the
first
successes
i
find
it
hard
to
trace
the
accumulation
of
moods
and
feelings
that
led
trafford
and
marjorie
at
last
to
make
their
extraordinary
raid
upon
labrador
in
a
week
more
things
happen
in
the
thoughts
of
such
a
man
as
trafford
changes
revocations
deflections
than
one
can
chronicle
in
the
longest
of
novels
i
have
already
in
an
earlier
passage
of
this
story
sought
to
give
an
image
of
the
confused
content
of
a
modern
human
mind
but
that
pool
was
to
represent
a
girl
of
twenty
and
trafford
now
was
a
man
of
nearly
and
touching
life
at
a
hundred
points
for
one
of
the
undergraduate
marjorie
perhaps
that
made
him
less
confused
but
it
certainly
made
him
fuller
let
me
attempt
therefore
only
the
broad
outline
of
his
changes
of
purpose
and
activity
until
i
come
to
the
crucial
mood
that
made
these
two
lives
a
little
worth
telling
about
amidst
the
many
thousands
of
such
lives
that
people
are
living
it
took
him
seven
years
from
his
conclusive
agreement
with
solomonson
to
become
a
rich
and
influential
man
it
took
him
only
seven
years
because
already
by
the
mere
accidents
of
intellectual
interest
he
was
in
possession
of
knowledge
of
the
very
greatest
economic
importance
and
because
solomonson
was
full
of
that
practical
loyalty
and
honesty
that
distinguishes
his
race
i
think
that
in
any
case
trafford
vigor
and
subtlety
of
mind
would
have
achieved
the
prosperity
he
had
found
necessary
to
himself
but
it
might
have
been
under
less
favorable
auspices
a
much
longer
and
more
tortuous
struggle
success
and
security
were
never
so
abundant
nor
so
easily
attained
by
men
with
capacity
and
a
sense
of
proportion
as
they
are
in
the
varied
and
flexible
world
of
we
live
in
an
affluent
age
with
a
nearly
incredible
continuous
fresh
increment
of
power
pouring
in
from
mechanical
invention
and
compared
with
our
own
most
other
periods
have
been
meagre
and
anxious
and
times
our
problems
are
constantly
less
the
problems
of
submission
and
consolation
and
continually
more
problems
of
opportunity
trafford
found
the
opening
campaign
the
operation
with
the
plantation
shares
and
his
explosion
of
behrens
pretensions
extremely
uncongenial
it
left
upon
his
mind
a
confused
series
of
memories
of
interviews
and
talks
in
offices
for
the
most
part
dingy
and
slovenly
of
bales
of
and
financial
publications
of
unpleasing
encounters
with
a
number
of
flushed
excitable
and
extremely
cunning
men
of
having
to
be
reserved
and
limited
in
his
talk
upon
all
occasions
and
of
all
the
worst
aspects
of
solomonson
all
that
part
of
the
new
treatment
of
life
that
was
to
make
him
rich
gave
him
sensations
as
though
he
had
ceased
to
wash
himself
mentally
until
he
regretted
his
old
life
in
his
laboratory
as
a
traveller
in
a
crowded
night
train
among
filthy
people
might
regret
the
bathroom
he
had
left
behind
him
but
the
development
of
his
manufacture
of
rubber
was
an
entirely
different
business
and
for
a
time
profoundly
interesting
it
took
him
into
a
new
astonishing
world
the
world
of
manufacture
and
industrial
organization
the
actual
planning
of
the
works
was
not
in
itself
anything
essentially
new
to
him
so
far
as
all
that
went
it
was
scarcely
more
than
the
problem
of
arranging
an
experiment
upon
a
huge
and
permanent
scale
and
all
that
quick
ingenuity
that
freshness
and
directness
of
mind
that
had
made
his
purely
scientific
work
so
admirable
had
ample
and
agreeable
scope
even
the
importance
of
cost
and
economy
at
every
point
in
the
process
involved
no
system
of
considerations
that
was
altogether
novel
to
him
the
british
investigator
knows
only
too
well
the
necessity
for
husbanded
material
and
inexpensive
substitutes
but
strange
factors
came
in
a
new
region
of
interest
was
opened
with
the
fact
that
instead
of
one
experimenter
working
with
the
alert
responsive
assistance
of
durgan
a
multitude
of
human
beings
even
in
the
first
drafts
of
his
project
they
numbered
already
two
hundred
before
the
handling
and
packing
could
be
considered
had
to
watch
control
assist
or
perform
every
stage
in
a
long
elaborate
synthesis
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
trafford
encountered
the
reality
of
labour
as
it
is
known
to
the
modern
producer
it
will
be
difficult
in
the
future
when
things
now
subtly
or
widely
separated
have
been
brought
together
by
the
receding
perspectives
of
time
for
the
historian
to
realize
just
how
completely
out
of
the
thoughts
of
such
a
young
man
as
trafford
the
millions
of
people
who
live
and
die
in
organized
productive
industry
had
been
that
vast
world
of
toil
and
weekly
anxiety
and
stupidly
directed
effort
and
mental
and
moral
feebleness
had
been
as
much
beyond
the
living
circle
of
his
experience
as
the
hosts
of
genghis
khan
or
the
social
life
of
the
forbidden
city
consider
the
limitations
of
his
world
in
all
his
life
hitherto
he
had
never
been
beyond
a
certain
prescribed
area
of
immensities
except
by
the
most
casual
and
uninstructive
straying
he
knew
chelsea
and
kensington
and
the
north
bank
and
as
a
boy
battersea
park
and
all
the
strip
between
kensington
and
charing
cross
with
some
scraps
of
the
strand
as
far
as
the
law
courts
a
shop
or
so
in
tottenham
court
road
and
fragments
about
the
british
museum
and
holborn
and
regent
park
a
range
up
edgware
road
to
maida
vale
the
routes
west
and
through
uxbridge
and
putney
to
the
country
and
wimbledon
common
and
putney
heath
he
had
never
been
on
hampstead
heath
nor
visited
the
botanical
gardens
nor
gone
down
the
thames
below
london
bridge
nor
seen
sydenham
nor
epping
forest
nor
the
victoria
park
take
a
map
and
blot
all
he
knew
and
see
how
vast
is
the
area
left
untouched
all
industrial
london
all
wholesale
london
great
oceans
of
human
beings
fall
into
that
excluded
area
the
homes
he
knew
were
comfortable
homes
the
poor
he
knew
were
the
parasitic
and
dependent
poor
of
the
west
the
shops
good
retail
shops
the
factories
for
the
most
part
engaged
in
dressmaking
of
course
he
had
been
informed
about
this
vast
rest
of
london
he
knew
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
it
existed
was
populous
portentous
puzzling
he
had
heard
of
slums
read
tales
of
mean
streets
and
marvelled
in
a
shallow
transitory
way
at
such
wide
wildernesses
of
life
apparently
supported
by
nothing
at
all
in
a
state
of
grey
darkling
but
prolific
discomfort
like
the
princess
who
wondered
why
the
people
having
no
bread
did
not
eat
cake
he
could
never
clearly
understand
why
the
population
remained
there
did
not
migrate
to
more
attractive
surroundings
he
had
discussed
the
problems
of
those
wildernesses
as
young
men
do
rather
confidently
very
ignorantly
had
dismissed
them
recurred
to
them
and
forgotten
them
amidst
a
press
of
other
interests
but
now
it
all
suddenly
became
real
to
him
with
the
intensity
of
a
startling
and
intimate
contact
he
discovered
this
limitless
unknown
greater
london
this
london
of
the
majority
as
if
he
had
never
thought
of
it
before
he
went
out
to
inspect
favourable
sites
in
regions
whose
very
names
were
unfamiliar
to
him
travelled
on
dirty
little
intraurban
railway
lines
to
hitherto
unimagined
railway
stations
found
parks
churches
workhouses
institutions
canals
factories
warehouses
foundries
and
sidings
amidst
a
multitudinous
dinginess
of
mean
houses
shabby
and
streets
there
seemed
to
be
no
limits
to
this
side
of
london
it
went
on
northward
eastward
and
over
the
thames
southward
for
mile
after
mile
endlessly
the
factories
and
so
forth
clustered
in
lines
and
banks
upon
the
means
of
communication
the
homes
stretched
between
and
infinitude
of
parallelograms
of
grimy
boxes
with
at
the
corners
and
churches
and
chapels
in
odd
places
towering
over
which
rose
the
council
schools
big
blunt
masses
the
means
to
an
education
as
blunt
and
truncated
born
of
tradition
and
confused
purposes
achieving
by
accident
what
they
achieve
at
all
and
about
this
wilderness
went
a
population
that
seemed
at
first
as
sordid
it
was
in
no
sense
a
tragic
population
but
it
saw
little
of
the
sun
felt
the
wind
but
rarely
and
so
had
a
white
dull
skin
that
looked
degenerate
and
ominous
to
a
eye
it
was
not
naked
nor
barefooted
but
it
wore
cheap
clothes
that
were
tawdry
when
new
and
speedily
became
faded
discoloured
dusty
and
draggled
it
was
slovenly
and
almost
wilfully
ugly
in
its
speech
and
gestures
and
the
food
it
ate
was
rough
and
coarse
if
abundant
the
eggs
it
consumed
tasted
everything
tasted
its
milk
its
beer
its
bread
was
degraded
by
base
adulterations
its
meat
was
hacked
red
stuff
that
hung
in
the
dusty
air
until
it
was
sold
east
of
the
city
trafford
could
find
no
place
where
by
his
standards
he
could
get
a
tolerable
meal
tolerably
served
the
entertainment
of
this
eastern
london
was
jingle
its
religion
its
reading
feeble
and
sensational
rubbish
without
kindliness
or
breadth
and
if
this
great
industrial
multitude
was
neither
tortured
nor
driven
nor
cruelly
treated
as
the
slaves
and
common
people
of
other
days
have
been
yet
it
was
universally
anxious
perpetually
anxious
about
urgent
small
necessities
and
petty
dissatisfying
things
that
was
the
general
effect
of
this
new
region
in
which
he
had
sought
out
and
found
the
fortunate
site
for
his
manufacture
of
rubber
and
against
this
background
it
was
that
he
had
now
to
encounter
a
crowd
of
selected
individuals
and
weld
them
into
a
harmonious
and
successful
process
they
came
out
from
their
millions
to
him
dingy
clumsy
and
at
first
it
seemed
without
any
individuality
insensibly
they
took
on
character
rounded
off
by
unaccustomed
methods
into
persons
as
marked
and
distinctive
as
any
he
had
known
there
was
dowd
for
instance
the
technical
assistant
whom
he
came
to
call
in
his
private
thoughts
dowd
the
disinherited
dowd
had
seemed
a
rather
awkward
potentially
insubordinate
young
man
of
unaccountably
extensive
and
curiously
limited
attainments
he
had
begun
his
career
in
a
crowded
home
behind
and
above
a
baker
shop
in
hoxton
he
had
gone
as
a
boy
into
the
works
of
a
clerkenwell
electric
engineer
and
there
he
had
developed
that
craving
for
knowledge
which
is
so
common
in
poor
men
of
the
energetic
type
he
had
gone
to
classes
read
with
a
sort
of
fury
feeding
his
mind
on
the
cheap
and
adulterated
instruction
of
crammers
and
on
stale
meretricious
and
books
his
mental
food
indeed
was
the
exact
parallel
of
the
rough
abundant
cheap
and
nasty
groceries
and
meat
that
gave
the
his
spots
and
dyspeptic
complexion
the
cheap
were
like
canned
meat
and
dangerous
with
intellectual
ptomaines
the
rascally
encyclopædias
like
weak
and
whitened
bread
and
dowd
mental
complexion
too
was
leaden
and
spotted
yet
essentially
he
was
trafford
found
by
any
means
bad
stuff
where
his
knowledge
had
had
a
chance
of
touching
reality
it
became
admirable
and
he
was
full
of
energy
in
his
work
and
a
sort
of
honest
zeal
about
the
things
of
the
mind
the
two
men
grew
from
an
acute
mutual
criticism
into
a
mutual
respect
at
first
it
seemed
to
trafford
that
when
he
met
dowd
he
was
only
meeting
dowd
but
a
time
came
when
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
meeting
dowd
he
was
meeting
all
that
vast
new
england
outside
the
range
of
dreams
that
multitudinous
greater
england
cheaply
treated
rather
out
of
health
angry
energetic
and
now
becoming
intelligent
and
critical
that
england
which
organized
industrialism
has
created
there
were
nights
when
he
thought
for
hours
about
dowd
other
figures
grouped
themselves
round
him
markham
the
head
clerk
the
quintessence
of
respectability
who
saw
to
the
packing
miss
peckover
an
operator
a
woman
so
entirely
reliable
and
unobservant
that
the
most
betraying
phase
of
the
secret
process
could
be
confidently
entrusted
to
her
hands
behind
them
were
clerks
workmen
men
a
crowd
of
from
amidst
which
some
individual
would
assume
temporary
importance
and
interest
by
doing
something
wrong
getting
into
trouble
becoming
insubordinate
and
having
contributed
a
little
vivid
story
to
trafford
gathering
impressions
of
life
drop
back
again
into
undistinguished
subordination
dowd
became
at
last
entirely
representative
when
first
trafford
looked
dowd
in
the
eye
he
met
something
of
the
hostile
interest
one
might
encounter
in
a
swordsman
ready
to
begin
a
duel
there
was
a
watchfulness
an
immense
reserve
they
discussed
the
work
and
the
terms
of
their
relationship
and
all
the
while
trafford
felt
there
was
something
almost
threateningly
not
mentioned
presently
he
learnt
from
a
silvertown
employer
what
that
concealed
aspect
was
dowd
was
that
sort
of
man
who
makes
trouble
disposed
to
strike
rather
than
not
upon
a
grievance
with
a
taste
for
meetings
a
member
obstinately
adherent
in
spite
of
friendly
remonstrance
of
the
social
democratic
party
this
in
spite
of
his
clear
duty
to
a
wife
and
two
small
white
knobby
children
for
a
time
he
would
not
talk
to
trafford
of
anything
but
business
trafford
was
so
manifestly
the
enemy
not
to
be
trusted
the
adventurous
plutocrat
the
exploiter
when
at
last
dowd
did
open
out
he
did
so
defiantly
throwing
opinions
at
trafford
as
a
mob
might
hurl
bricks
at
windows
at
last
they
achieved
a
sort
of
friendship
and
understanding
an
amiability
as
it
were
in
hostility
but
never
from
first
to
last
would
he
talk
to
trafford
as
one
gentleman
to
another
between
them
and
crossed
only
by
flimsy
temporary
bridges
was
his
sense
of
incurable
grievances
and
fundamental
injustice
he
seemed
incapable
of
forgetting
the
disadvantages
of
his
birth
and
upbringing
the
inferiority
and
disorder
of
the
house
that
sheltered
him
the
poor
food
that
nourished
him
the
deadened
air
he
breathed
the
limited
leisure
the
inadequate
books
implicit
in
his
every
word
and
act
was
the
assurance
that
but
for
this
handicap
he
could
have
filled
trafford
place
while
trafford
would
certainly
have
failed
in
his
for
all
these
things
dowd
made
trafford
responsible
he
held
him
to
that
inexorably
sweat
us
he
said
speaking
between
his
teeth
limit
us
stifle
us
and
away
there
in
the
and
the
women
you
keep
waste
the
plunder
trafford
attempted
palliation
after
all
he
said
it
not
me
so
particularly
but
it
is
said
dowd
it
the
system
things
go
upon
you
the
responsible
part
of
it
have
freedom
have
power
and
endless
opportunity
trafford
shrugged
his
shoulders
it
because
your
sort
wants
too
much
said
dowd
that
my
sort
enough
tell
me
how
to
organize
things
better
much
you
care
they
organize
themselves
everything
is
drifting
to
class
separation
the
growing
discontent
the
growing
hardship
of
the
masses
then
you
see
then
what
going
to
happen
overthrow
and
social
democracy
how
is
that
going
to
work
dowd
had
been
cornered
by
that
before
i
do
care
if
it
work
he
snarled
so
long
as
we
smash
up
this
we
getting
too
sick
to
care
what
comes
after
dowd
said
trafford
abruptly
not
so
satisfied
with
things
dowd
looked
at
him
askance
you
get
reconciled
to
it
he
said
ugly
here
but
it
all
right
there
at
the
spending
end
your
sort
has
got
to
grab
your
sort
has
got
to
spend
until
the
thing
works
out
and
the
social
revolution
makes
an
end
of
you
and
then
dowd
became
busy
with
his
work
trafford
stuck
his
hands
in
his
pockets
and
stared
out
of
the
dingy
factory
window
i
do
object
so
much
to
your
diagnosis
he
said
as
to
your
remedy
it
does
strike
me
as
a
remedy
it
an
end
said
dowd
anyhow
my
god
when
i
think
of
all
the
women
and
shirkers
flaunting
and
frittering
away
there
in
the
west
while
here
men
and
women
toil
and
worry
and
starve
he
stopped
short
like
one
who
feels
too
full
for
controlled
speech
dowd
said
trafford
after
a
fair
pause
what
would
you
do
if
you
were
me
do
said
dowd
yes
said
trafford
as
one
who
reconsiders
it
what
would
you
do
now
that
a
curious
question
trafford
said
dowd
turning
to
regard
him
meaning
if
i
were
in
your
place
yes
said
trafford
what
would
you
do
in
my
place
i
should
sell
out
of
this
place
jolly
quick
he
said
said
trafford
softly
yes
sell
and
start
a
socialist
daily
right
off
an
absolutely
independent
unbiassed
socialist
daily
and
what
would
that
do
it
would
stir
people
up
every
day
it
would
stir
people
up
but
you
see
i
ca
edit
i
have
the
money
for
half
a
year
of
a
socialist
daily
and
meanwhile
people
want
rubber
dowd
shook
his
head
you
mean
that
you
and
your
wife
want
to
have
the
spending
of
six
or
eight
thousand
a
year
he
said
i
do
make
half
of
that
said
trafford
well
half
of
that
pressed
dowd
it
all
the
same
to
me
trafford
reflected
the
point
where
i
do
agree
with
you
he
said
is
in
supposing
that
my
scale
of
living
over
there
is
directly
connected
with
the
scale
of
living
about
here
well
is
it
i
said
no
if
we
just
stopped
it
over
there
there
be
no
improvement
here
in
fact
for
a
time
it
would
mean
dislocations
it
might
mean
permanent
hopeless
catastrophic
dislocation
you
know
that
as
well
as
i
do
suppose
the
became
tolstoyan
the
east
would
become
chaos
not
much
likelihood
sneered
dowd
that
another
question
that
we
earn
together
here
and
that
i
spend
alone
over
there
it
unjust
and
bad
but
it
is
a
thing
that
admits
of
any
simple
remedy
where
we
differ
dowd
is
about
that
remedy
i
admit
the
disease
as
fully
as
you
do
i
as
much
as
you
want
to
see
the
dawn
of
a
great
change
in
the
ways
of
human
living
but
i
do
think
the
diagnosis
is
complete
and
satisfactory
our
problem
is
an
intricate
muddle
of
disorders
not
one
simple
disorder
and
i
do
see
what
treatment
is
indicated
socialism
said
dowd
is
indicated
you
might
as
well
say
that
health
is
indicated
said
trafford
with
a
note
of
impatience
in
his
voice
does
any
one
question
that
if
we
could
have
this
socialist
state
in
which
every
one
is
devoted
and
every
one
is
free
in
which
there
is
no
waste
and
no
want
and
beauty
and
brotherhood
prevail
universally
we
would
but
you
socialists
have
no
scheme
of
government
no
scheme
of
economic
organization
no
intelligible
guarantees
of
personal
liberty
no
method
of
progress
no
ideas
about
marriage
no
plan
except
those
little
pickpocket
plans
of
the
fabians
that
you
despise
as
much
as
i
do
for
making
this
order
into
that
other
order
you
never
yet
taken
the
trouble
to
work
out
even
in
principle
really
you
know
dowd
what
is
the
good
of
pointing
at
my
wife
dresses
and
waving
the
red
flag
at
me
and
talking
of
human
miseries
it
seems
to
wake
you
up
a
bit
said
dowd
with
characteristic
irrelevance
the
accusing
finger
of
dowd
followed
trafford
into
his
dreams
behind
it
was
his
intelligent
resentful
face
his
smouldering
eyes
his
slightly
frayed
collar
and
vivid
tie
at
times
trafford
could
almost
hear
his
flat
insistent
voice
his
measured
speech
dowd
was
so
penetratingly
right
and
so
ignorant
of
certain
essentials
so
wrong
in
his
forecasts
and
ultimates
it
was
true
beyond
disputing
that
trafford
as
compared
with
dowd
had
opportunity
power
of
a
sort
the
prospect
and
possibility
of
leisure
he
admitted
the
liability
that
followed
on
that
advantage
it
expressed
so
entirely
the
spirit
of
his
training
that
with
trafford
the
noble
maxim
of
the
older
socialists
from
each
according
to
his
ability
to
each
according
to
his
need
received
an
intuitive
acquiescence
he
had
no
more
doubt
than
dowd
that
dowd
was
the
victim
of
a
subtle
evasive
injustice
innocently
and
helplessly
underbred
underfed
cramped
and
crippled
and
that
all
his
own
surplus
made
him
in
a
sense
debtor
but
dowd
remedies
trafford
made
himself
familiar
with
the
socialist
and
labor
newspapers
and
he
was
as
much
impressed
by
their
honest
resentments
and
their
enthusiastic
hopefulness
as
he
was
repelled
by
their
haste
and
ignorance
their
cocksure
confidence
in
untried
reforms
and
impudent
teachers
their
indiscriminating
progressiveness
their
impulsive
lapses
into
hatred
misrepresentation
and
vehement
personal
abuse
he
was
in
no
mood
for
the
humours
of
human
character
and
he
found
the
feuds
and
jealousies
of
the
leaders
the
sham
statecraft
of
magdeberg
the
sham
machiavellism
of
dorvil
the
sham
persistent
of
will
pipes
discouraging
and
irritating
altogether
it
seemed
to
him
the
conscious
popular
movement
in
politics
both
in
and
out
of
parliament
was
a
mere
formless
and
indeterminate
aspiration
it
was
a
confused
part
of
the
general
confusion
symptomatic
perhaps
but
exercising
no
controls
and
no
direction
his
attention
passed
from
the
consideration
of
this
completely
revolutionary
party
to
the
general
field
of
social
reform
with
the
naïve
directness
of
a
scientific
man
he
got
together
the
published
literature
of
half
a
dozen
flourishing
agitations
and
philanthropies
interviewed
prominent
and
rather
embarrassed
personages
attended
meetings
and
when
he
found
the
speeches
too
tiresome
to
follow
watched
the
audience
about
him
he
even
looked
up
aunt
plessington
movement
and
filled
her
with
wild
hopes
and
premature
boastings
about
a
promising
convert
marjorie
brought
him
round
at
last
said
aunt
plessington
i
knew
i
could
trust
my
little
madge
his
impression
was
not
the
cynic
impression
of
these
wide
shallows
of
activity
progress
and
social
reform
are
not
he
saw
mere
cloaks
of
hypocrisy
a
wealth
of
good
intention
lies
behind
them
in
spite
of
their
manifest
futility
there
is
much
dishonesty
due
to
the
blundering
desire
for
consistency
in
people
of
hasty
intention
much
artless
and
a
little
calculated
but
far
more
vanity
and
amiable
feebleness
of
mind
in
their
general
attainment
of
failure
the
plessingtons
struck
him
as
being
after
all
very
typical
of
the
publicist
at
large
quite
devoted
very
industrious
extremely
presumptuous
and
essentially
they
would
cheat
like
children
for
example
on
some
petty
point
of
reputation
but
they
could
be
trusted
to
expend
ineffectually
indeed
but
with
the
extremest
technical
integrity
whatever
sums
of
money
their
adherents
could
get
together
he
emerged
from
this
inquiry
into
the
proposed
remedies
and
palliatives
for
dowd
wrongs
with
a
better
opinion
of
people
hearts
and
a
worse
one
of
their
heads
than
he
had
hitherto
entertained
pursuing
this
line
of
thought
he
passed
from
the
politicians
and
practical
workers
to
the
economists
and
sociologists
he
spent
the
entire
leisure
of
the
second
summer
after
the
establishment
of
the
factory
upon
sociological
and
economic
literature
at
the
end
of
that
bout
of
reading
he
attained
a
vivid
realization
of
the
garrulous
badness
that
rules
in
this
field
of
work
and
the
prevailing
slovenliness
and
negligence
in
regard
to
it
he
chanced
one
day
to
look
up
the
article
on
socialism
in
the
new
encyclopædia
britannica
and
found
in
its
entire
failure
to
state
the
case
for
or
against
modern
socialism
to
trace
its
origins
or
to
indicate
any
rational
development
in
the
movement
a
symptom
of
the
universal
laxity
of
interest
in
these
matters
indeed
the
writer
did
not
appear
to
have
heard
of
modern
socialism
at
all
he
discussed
collective
and
individualist
methods
very
much
as
a
rather
schoolgirl
in
a
hurry
for
her
college
debating
society
might
have
done
compared
with
the
treatment
of
engineering
or
biological
science
in
the
same
compilation
this
article
became
almost
symbolical
of
the
prevailing
habitual
incompetence
with
which
all
this
system
of
questions
is
still
handled
the
sciences
were
done
scantily
and
carelessly
enough
but
they
admitted
at
any
rate
the
possibility
of
completeness
this
did
not
even
pretend
to
thoroughness
one
might
think
such
things
had
no
practical
significance
and
at
the
back
of
it
all
was
dowd
remarkably
more
impatient
each
year
confessing
the
failure
of
parliamentary
methods
of
trades
unionism
hinting
more
and
more
plainly
at
the
advent
of
a
permanent
guerilla
war
against
capital
at
the
general
strike
and
sabotage
it
coming
to
that
said
dowd
it
coming
to
that
the
good
of
it
he
said
echoing
trafford
words
it
a
sort
of
relief
to
the
feelings
why
should
we
but
you
must
not
suppose
that
at
any
time
these
huge
grey
problems
of
our
social
foundations
and
the
riddle
of
intellectual
confusion
one
reaches
through
them
and
the
yet
broader
riddles
of
human
purpose
that
open
beyond
constitute
the
whole
of
trafford
life
during
this
time
when
he
came
back
to
marjorie
and
his
home
a
curtain
of
unreality
fell
between
him
and
all
these
things
it
was
as
if
he
stepped
through
such
boundaries
as
alice
passed
to
reach
her
wonderland
the
other
world
became
a
dream
again
as
if
he
closed
the
pages
of
a
vivid
book
and
turned
to
things
about
him
or
again
it
was
as
if
he
drew
down
the
blind
of
a
window
that
gave
upon
a
landscape
grave
darkling
ominous
and
faced
the
warm
realities
of
a
brightly
illuminated
room
in
a
year
or
so
he
had
the
works
so
smoothly
organized
and
dowd
so
reconciled
trained
and
encouraged
that
his
own
daily
presence
was
unnecessary
and
he
would
go
only
three
and
then
only
two
mornings
a
week
to
conduct
those
secret
phases
in
the
preparation
of
his
catalytic
that
even
dowd
could
not
be
trusted
to
know
he
reverted
more
and
more
completely
to
his
own
proper
world
and
the
first
shock
of
discovering
that
greater
london
which
is
in
it
passed
away
by
imperceptible
degrees
things
that
had
been
as
vivid
and
startling
as
new
wounds
became
unstimulating
and
ineffective
with
repetition
he
got
used
to
the
change
from
belgravia
to
east
ham
from
east
ham
to
belgravia
he
fell
in
with
the
unusual
persuasion
in
belgravia
that
given
a
firm
and
prompt
home
secretary
east
ham
could
be
trusted
to
go
on
for
quite
a
long
time
anyhow
one
can
not
sit
down
for
all
one
life
in
the
face
of
insoluble
problems
he
had
a
now
that
far
outshone
magnet
and
he
made
the
transit
from
west
to
east
in
the
minimum
of
time
and
with
the
minimum
of
friction
it
ceased
to
be
more
disconcerting
that
he
should
have
workers
whom
he
could
dismiss
at
a
week
notice
to
want
or
prostitution
than
that
he
should
have
a
servant
waiting
behind
his
chair
things
were
so
the
main
current
of
his
life
and
the
main
current
of
his
life
flowed
through
marjorie
and
his
home
carried
him
on
rubber
was
his
but
there
were
still
limitless
worlds
to
conquer
he
began
to
take
up
working
under
circumstances
of
considerable
secrecy
at
solomonson
laboratories
at
riplings
to
which
he
would
now
go
by
for
two
or
three
days
at
a
time
the
possibility
of
a
cheap
resilient
and
very
tough
substance
rubber
glass
that
was
to
be
solomonson
was
assured
the
road
surface
of
the
future
the
confidence
of
solomonson
had
made
it
impossible
for
trafford
to
alter
his
style
of
living
almost
directly
upon
the
conclusion
of
their
agreement
he
went
back
to
marjorie
to
broach
a
financially
emancipated
phase
they
took
a
furnished
house
at
shackleford
near
godalming
in
surrey
and
there
they
lived
for
nearly
a
year
using
their
chelsea
home
only
as
a
town
apartment
for
trafford
when
business
held
him
in
london
and
there
it
was
in
the
pretty
surrey
country
with
the
sweet
air
of
pine
and
heather
in
marjorie
blood
that
their
second
child
was
born
it
was
a
sturdy
little
boy
whose
only
danger
in
life
seemed
to
be
the
superfluous
energy
with
which
he
resented
its
slightest
disrespect
of
his
small
but
important
requirements
when
it
was
time
for
marjorie
to
return
to
london
spring
had
come
round
again
and
trafford
conceptions
of
life
were
adapting
themselves
to
the
new
scale
upon
which
they
were
now
to
do
things
while
he
was
busy
creating
his
factory
in
the
east
end
marjorie
was
displaying
an
equal
if
a
less
original
constructive
energy
in
sussex
square
near
lancaster
gate
for
there
it
was
the
new
home
was
to
be
established
she
set
herself
to
furnish
and
arrange
it
so
as
to
produce
the
maximum
of
surprise
and
chagrin
in
daphne
and
she
succeeded
admirably
the
magnets
now
occupied
a
flat
in
whitehall
court
the
furniture
magnet
had
insisted
upon
buying
himself
with
all
the
occult
cunning
of
the
humorist
in
these
matters
and
not
even
daphne
could
blind
herself
to
the
superiority
both
in
arrangement
and
detail
of
marjorie
home
that
was
very
satisfactory
and
so
too
was
the
inevitable
exaggeration
of
trafford
financial
importance
he
can
do
what
he
likes
in
the
rubber
world
said
marjorie
in
mincing
lane
where
they
deal
in
rubber
shares
they
used
to
call
him
and
sir
rupert
the
invaders
now
they
call
them
the
conquering
heroes
of
course
it
mere
child
play
to
godwin
but
as
he
said
want
money
it
wo
really
interfere
with
his
more
important
interests
i
do
not
know
why
both
those
sisters
were
more
vulgarly
competitive
with
each
other
than
with
any
one
else
i
have
merely
to
record
the
fact
that
they
were
so
the
effect
upon
the
rest
of
marjorie
family
was
equally
gratifying
pope
came
to
the
as
though
he
had
never
had
the
slightest
objection
to
trafford
antecedents
and
told
him
casually
after
dinner
that
marjorie
had
always
been
his
favourite
daughter
and
that
from
the
first
he
had
expected
great
things
of
her
he
told
magnet
who
was
the
third
man
of
the
party
that
he
only
hoped
syd
and
rom
would
do
as
well
as
their
elder
sisters
afterwards
in
the
he
whacked
marjorie
suddenly
and
very
startlingly
on
the
it
was
the
first
bruise
he
had
given
her
since
buryhamstreet
days
made
a
man
of
him
maggots
he
said
the
quiet
smile
of
the
christian
scientist
was
becoming
now
the
fixed
expression
of
pope
face
and
it
scarcely
relaxed
for
a
moment
as
she
surveyed
her
daughter
splendours
she
had
triumphantly
refused
to
worry
over
a
rather
serious
speculative
disappointment
but
her
faith
in
her
prophet
spiritual
power
had
been
strengthened
rather
than
weakened
by
the
manifest
insufficiency
of
his
financial
prestidigitations
and
she
was
getting
through
life
quite
radiantly
now
smiling
at
but
not
of
course
giving
way
to
beggars
smiling
at
toothaches
and
headaches
both
her
own
and
other
people
smiling
away
doubts
smiling
away
everything
that
bows
the
spirit
of
those
who
are
still
in
the
bonds
of
the
flesh
afterwards
the
children
came
round
syd
and
rom
now
with
skirts
down
and
hair
up
and
rather
stiff
in
the
fine
big
rooms
and
theodore
in
a
high
collar
and
very
anxious
to
get
trafford
on
his
side
in
his
ambition
to
chuck
a
proposed
bank
clerkship
and
go
in
for
professional
aviation
it
was
pleasant
to
be
respected
by
her
family
again
but
the
mind
of
marjorie
was
soon
reaching
out
to
the
more
novel
possibilities
of
her
changed
position
she
need
no
longer
confine
herself
to
teas
and
afternoons
she
could
now
delightful
thought
give
dinners
dinners
are
mere
vulgarities
for
the
vulgar
but
in
the
measure
of
your
brains
does
a
dinner
become
a
work
of
art
there
is
the
happy
blending
of
a
modern
and
distinguished
simplicity
with
a
choice
of
items
essentially
good
and
delightful
and
just
a
little
bit
not
what
was
expected
there
is
the
still
more
interesting
and
difficult
blending
and
arrangement
of
the
diners
from
the
first
marjorie
resolved
on
a
round
table
and
the
achievement
of
that
rare
and
wonderful
thing
general
conversation
she
had
a
clear
centre
with
a
circle
of
silver
bowls
filled
with
short
cut
flowers
and
low
shaded
old
silver
candlesticks
adapted
to
the
electric
light
the
first
dinner
was
a
nervous
experience
for
her
but
happily
trafford
seemed
unconscious
of
the
importance
of
the
occasion
and
talked
very
easily
and
well
at
last
she
attained
her
old
ambition
to
see
sir
roderick
dover
in
her
house
and
there
was
remington
the
editor
of
the
and
his
silent
gracious
wife
edward
crampton
the
historian
full
of
surprising
new
facts
about
kosciusko
the
solomonsons
and
millingham
and
mary
gasthorne
the
novelist
it
was
a
good
talking
lot
remington
sparred
agreeably
with
the
old
toryism
of
dover
flank
attacks
upon
them
both
were
delivered
by
millingham
and
trafford
crampton
instanced
hungarian
parallels
and
was
happily
averted
by
mary
gasthorne
with
travel
experiences
in
the
carpathians
the
diamonds
of
lady
solomonson
and
remington
flashed
and
winked
across
the
shining
table
as
their
wearers
listened
with
unmistakable
intelligence
and
when
the
ladies
had
gone
upstairs
sir
rupert
solomonson
told
all
the
men
exactly
what
he
thought
of
the
policy
of
the
a
balanced
judgment
upstairs
lady
solomonson
betrayed
a
passion
of
admiration
for
remington
and
millingham
mumbled
depreciation
of
the
same
lady
intelligence
in
mary
gasthorne
unwilling
ear
she
said
millingham
she
bores
him
for
a
time
marjorie
found
delightful
it
is
like
picking
and
arranging
posies
of
human
flowers
and
fruits
and
perhaps
a
little
dried
grass
and
it
was
not
long
before
she
learnt
that
she
was
esteemed
a
success
as
a
hostess
she
gathered
her
earlier
bunches
in
the
carmel
and
solomonson
circle
with
a
stiffening
from
among
the
literary
and
scientific
friends
of
trafford
and
his
mother
and
one
or
two
casual
and
undervalued
blossoms
from
aunt
plessington
active
promiscuities
she
had
soon
a
gaily
flowering
garden
of
her
own
to
pick
from
its
strength
and
finest
display
lay
in
its
increasing
proportion
of
political
intellectuals
men
in
and
about
the
house
who
relaxed
their
minds
from
the
tense
detailed
alertness
needed
in
political
intrigues
by
conversation
that
rose
at
times
to
the
level
of
the
smarter
sort
of
article
in
the
reviews
the
women
were
more
difficult
than
the
men
and
marjorie
found
herself
wishing
at
times
that
girl
novelists
and
playwrights
were
more
abundant
or
women
writers
on
the
average
younger
these
talked
generally
well
and
one
or
two
capable
women
of
her
own
type
talked
and
listened
with
an
effect
of
talking
so
many
other
women
either
chattered
disturbingly
or
else
did
not
listen
with
an
effect
of
not
talking
at
all
and
so
made
gaps
about
the
table
many
of
these
latter
had
to
be
asked
because
they
belonged
to
the
class
of
inevitable
wives
and
through
them
she
learnt
the
value
of
that
priceless
variety
of
kindly
unselfish
men
who
can
create
the
illusion
of
attentive
conversation
in
the
most
uncomfortable
and
suspicious
natures
without
producing
backwater
and
eddy
in
the
general
flow
of
talk
indisputably
marjorie
dinners
were
successful
of
course
the
abundance
and
æsthetic
achievements
of
lee
still
seemed
to
her
immeasurably
out
of
reach
but
it
was
already
possible
to
show
aunt
plessington
how
the
thing
ought
really
to
be
done
aunt
plessington
with
her
narrow
lank
austerely
served
table
with
a
sort
of
at
her
own
end
and
a
subjugated
forecastle
round
hubert
and
accordingly
the
plessingtons
were
invited
and
shown
and
to
a
party
too
that
restrained
aunt
plessington
from
her
usual
conversational
prominence
these
opening
years
of
trafford
commercial
phase
were
full
of
an
engaging
activity
for
marjorie
as
for
him
and
for
her
far
more
completely
than
for
him
were
the
profounder
solicitudes
of
life
lost
sight
of
in
the
bright
succession
of
immediate
events
marjorie
did
not
let
her
social
development
interfere
with
her
duty
to
society
in
the
larger
sense
two
years
after
the
vigorous
and
resentful
godwin
came
a
second
son
and
a
year
and
a
half
later
a
third
enough
said
marjorie
now
we
got
to
rear
them
the
nursery
at
sussex
square
had
always
been
a
show
part
of
the
house
but
it
became
her
crowning
achievement
she
had
never
forgotten
the
lee
display
at
vevey
the
shining
splendours
of
modern
maternity
the
books
the
apparatus
the
space
and
light
and
air
the
whole
second
floor
was
altered
to
accommodate
these
four
triumphant
beings
who
absorbed
the
services
of
two
nurses
a
swiss
nursery
governess
and
two
housemaids
not
to
mention
those
several
hundred
obscure
individuals
who
were
yielding
a
sustaining
profit
in
the
east
end
at
any
rate
they
were
very
handsome
and
promising
children
and
little
margharita
could
talk
three
languages
with
a
childish
fluency
and
invent
and
write
a
short
fable
in
either
french
or
german
with
only
as
much
misspelling
as
any
child
of
eight
may
be
permitted
then
there
sprang
up
a
competition
between
marjorie
and
the
able
pretty
wife
of
halford
wallace
most
promising
of
they
gave
dinners
against
each
other
they
discovered
young
artists
against
each
other
they
went
to
and
dressed
against
each
other
marjorie
was
ruddy
and
tall
halford
wallace
dark
and
animated
halford
wallace
admired
marjorie
trafford
was
insensible
to
halford
wallace
they
played
for
points
so
vague
that
it
was
impossible
for
any
one
to
say
which
was
winning
but
none
the
less
they
played
like
artists
for
all
they
were
worth
trafford
rapid
prosperity
and
his
implicit
promise
of
still
wider
activities
and
successes
brought
him
innumerable
acquaintances
and
many
friends
he
joined
two
or
three
distinguished
clubs
he
derived
an
uncertain
interest
from
a
series
of
visits
to
ample
households
and
for
a
time
he
found
a
distraction
in
little
flashes
of
travel
to
countries
that
caught
at
his
imagination
morocco
montenegro
southern
russia
i
do
not
know
whether
marjorie
might
not
have
been
altogether
happy
during
this
early
sussex
square
period
if
it
had
not
been
for
an
unconquerable
uncertainty
about
trafford
but
ever
and
again
she
became
vaguely
apprehensive
of
some
perplexing
unreality
in
her
position
she
had
never
had
any
such
profundity
of
discontent
as
he
experienced
it
was
nothing
clear
nothing
that
actually
penetrated
distressing
her
it
was
at
most
an
uneasiness
for
him
the
whole
fabric
of
life
was
as
it
were
torn
and
pieced
by
a
provocative
sense
of
depths
unplumbed
that
robbed
it
of
all
its
satisfactions
for
her
these
glimpses
were
as
yet
rare
mere
moments
of
doubt
that
passed
again
and
left
her
active
and
assured
it
was
only
after
they
had
been
married
six
or
seven
years
that
trafford
began
to
realize
how
widely
his
attitudes
to
marjorie
varied
he
emerged
slowly
from
a
naïve
unconsciousness
of
his
fluctuations
a
naïve
unconsciousness
of
inconsistency
that
for
most
men
and
women
remains
throughout
life
his
ruling
idea
that
she
and
he
were
friends
equals
confederates
knowing
everything
about
each
other
in
everything
was
very
fixed
and
firm
but
indeed
that
had
become
the
remotest
rendering
of
their
relationship
their
lives
were
lives
of
intimate
disengagement
they
came
nearest
to
fellowship
in
relation
to
their
children
there
they
shared
an
immense
common
pride
beyond
that
was
a
less
confident
appreciation
of
their
common
house
and
their
joint
effect
and
then
they
liked
and
loved
each
other
tremendously
they
could
play
upon
each
other
and
please
each
other
in
a
hundred
different
ways
and
they
did
so
quite
consciously
observing
each
other
with
the
completest
externality
she
was
still
in
many
ways
for
him
the
bright
girl
he
had
admired
in
the
examination
still
the
mysterious
dignified
transfiguration
of
that
delightful
creature
on
the
tragically
tender
verge
of
motherhood
these
memories
were
of
more
power
with
him
than
the
present
realities
of
her
strength
and
capacity
he
petted
and
played
with
the
girl
still
he
was
still
tender
and
solicitous
for
that
early
woman
he
admired
and
also
with
the
capable
narrowly
ambitious
beautiful
lady
into
which
marjorie
had
developed
but
those
remoter
experiences
it
was
that
gave
the
deeper
emotions
to
their
relationship
the
conflict
of
aims
that
had
at
last
brought
trafford
from
scientific
investigation
into
business
had
left
behind
it
a
little
scar
of
hostility
he
felt
his
sacrifice
he
felt
that
he
had
given
something
for
her
that
she
had
had
no
right
to
exact
that
he
had
gone
beyond
the
free
mutualities
of
honest
love
and
paid
a
price
for
her
he
had
deflected
the
whole
course
of
his
life
for
her
and
he
was
entitled
to
repayments
unconsciously
he
had
become
a
slightly
jealous
husband
he
resented
inattentions
and
absences
he
felt
she
ought
to
be
with
him
and
orient
all
her
proceedings
towards
him
he
did
not
like
other
people
to
show
too
marked
an
appreciation
of
her
she
had
a
healthy
love
of
admiration
and
in
addition
her
social
ambitions
made
it
almost
inevitable
that
at
times
she
should
use
her
great
personal
charm
to
secure
and
retain
adherents
he
was
ashamed
to
betray
the
resentments
thus
occasioned
and
his
silence
widened
the
separation
more
than
any
protest
could
have
done
for
his
own
part
he
gave
her
no
cause
for
a
reciprocal
jealousy
other
women
did
not
excite
his
imagination
very
greatly
and
he
had
none
of
the
ready
disposition
to
lapse
to
other
comforters
which
is
so
frequent
a
characteristic
of
the
husband
out
of
touch
with
his
life
companion
he
was
perhaps
an
exceptional
man
in
his
steadfast
loyalty
to
his
wife
he
had
come
to
her
as
new
to
love
as
she
had
been
he
had
never
in
his
life
taken
that
one
decisive
illicit
step
which
changes
all
the
aspects
of
sexual
life
for
a
man
even
more
than
for
a
woman
love
for
him
was
a
thing
solemn
simple
and
unspoilt
he
perceived
that
it
was
not
so
for
most
other
men
but
that
did
little
to
modify
his
own
private
attitude
in
his
curious
scrutiny
of
the
people
about
him
he
did
not
fail
to
note
the
drift
of
adventures
and
infidelities
that
glimmers
along
beneath
the
even
surface
of
our
social
life
one
or
two
of
his
intimate
friends
solomonson
was
one
of
them
passed
through
affairs
once
or
twice
those
dim
proceedings
splashed
upward
to
the
surface
in
an
open
scandal
there
came
remington
startling
elopement
with
isabel
rivers
the
writer
which
took
two
brilliant
and
inspiring
contemporaries
suddenly
and
distressingly
out
of
trafford
world
trafford
felt
none
of
that
rage
and
forced
and
jealous
contempt
for
the
delinquents
in
these
matters
which
is
common
in
the
virtuous
mind
indeed
he
was
far
more
sympathetic
with
than
hostile
to
the
offenders
he
had
brains
and
imagination
to
appreciate
the
grim
pathos
of
a
process
that
begins
as
a
hopeful
quest
full
of
the
suggestion
of
noble
possibilities
full
of
the
craving
for
missed
intensities
of
fellowship
and
realization
that
loiters
involuntarily
towards
beauties
and
delights
and
ends
at
last
too
often
after
gratification
of
an
appetite
in
artificially
hideous
exposures
and
the
pelting
misrepresentations
of
the
timidly
vile
but
the
general
effect
of
pitiful
evasions
of
unavoidable
meannesses
of
draggled
heroics
and
tortuously
insincere
explanations
confirmed
him
in
his
aversion
from
this
labyrinthine
trouble
of
extraneous
love
but
if
trafford
was
a
faithful
husband
he
ceased
to
be
a
happy
and
confident
one
there
grew
up
in
him
a
vast
hinterland
of
thoughts
and
feelings
an
accumulation
of
unspoken
and
largely
of
unformulated
things
in
which
his
wife
had
no
share
and
it
was
in
that
hinterland
that
his
essential
self
had
its
abiding
place
it
came
as
a
discovery
it
remained
for
ever
after
a
profoundly
disturbing
perplexity
that
he
had
talked
to
marjorie
most
carelessly
easily
and
seriously
during
their
courtship
and
their
honeymoon
he
remembered
their
early
intercourse
now
as
an
immense
happy
freedom
in
love
then
afterwards
a
curtain
had
fallen
that
almost
delirious
sense
of
escaping
from
oneself
of
having
at
last
found
some
one
from
whom
there
need
be
no
concealment
some
one
before
whom
one
could
stand
and
assured
of
love
as
one
stands
before
one
god
faded
so
that
he
scarce
observed
its
passing
but
only
discovered
at
last
that
it
had
gone
he
misunderstood
and
met
misunderstanding
he
found
he
could
hurt
her
by
the
things
he
said
and
be
exquisitely
hurt
by
her
failure
to
apprehend
the
spirit
of
some
intention
and
it
was
so
vitally
important
not
to
hurt
not
to
be
hurt
at
first
he
only
perceived
that
he
reserved
himself
then
there
came
the
intimation
of
the
question
was
she
also
perhaps
in
such
another
hinterland
as
his
keeping
herself
from
him
he
had
perceived
the
cessation
of
that
first
bright
outbreak
of
this
relapse
into
the
secrecies
of
individuality
quite
early
in
their
married
life
i
have
already
told
of
his
first
efforts
to
bridge
their
widening
separation
by
walks
and
talks
in
the
country
and
by
the
long
pilgrimage
among
the
alps
that
had
ended
so
unexpectedly
at
vevey
in
the
retrospect
the
years
seemed
punctuated
with
phases
when
we
must
talk
dominated
their
intercourse
and
each
time
the
impulse
of
that
recognized
need
passed
away
by
insensible
degrees
again
with
nothing
said
marjorie
cherished
an
obstinate
hope
that
trafford
would
take
up
political
questions
and
go
into
parliament
it
seemed
to
her
that
there
was
something
about
him
altogether
graver
and
wider
than
most
of
the
active
politicians
she
knew
she
liked
to
think
of
those
gravities
assuming
a
practical
form
of
trafford
very
rapidly
and
easily
coming
forward
into
a
position
of
cardinal
significance
it
gave
her
general
expenditure
a
quality
of
concentration
without
involving
any
uncongenial
limitation
to
suppose
it
aimed
at
the
preparation
of
a
circle
whenever
trafford
chose
to
adopt
that
assumption
little
men
in
great
positions
came
to
her
house
and
talked
with
opaque
at
her
table
she
measured
them
against
her
husband
while
she
played
the
admiring
female
disciple
to
their
talk
she
felt
that
he
could
take
up
these
questions
and
measures
that
they
reduced
to
trite
twaddle
open
the
wide
relevancies
behind
them
and
make
them
magically
significant
sweep
away
the
encrusting
pettiness
the
personalities
and
arbitrary
prejudices
but
why
did
he
begin
to
do
it
she
threw
out
hints
he
seemed
blind
towards
she
exercised
miracles
of
patience
while
he
ignored
her
baits
she
came
near
intrigue
in
her
endeavor
to
entangle
him
in
political
affairs
for
a
time
it
seemed
to
her
that
she
was
succeeding
i
have
already
told
of
his
phase
of
inquiry
and
interest
in
work
and
then
he
relapsed
into
a
scornful
restlessness
and
her
hopes
weakened
again
but
he
could
not
concentrate
his
mind
he
could
not
think
where
to
begin
day
followed
day
each
with
its
attacks
upon
his
intention
its
petty
just
claims
its
attractive
novelties
of
aspect
the
telephone
bell
rang
the
letters
flopped
into
the
hall
malcom
the
butler
seemed
always
at
hand
with
some
distracting
oblong
on
his
salver
dowd
was
developing
ideas
for
a
reconstructed
organization
of
the
factory
solomonson
growing
enthusiastic
about
his
house
seemed
full
of
women
marjorie
had
an
engagement
for
him
to
keep
or
the
children
were
coming
in
to
say
to
his
irritated
brain
the
whole
scheme
of
his
life
presented
itself
at
last
as
a
tissue
of
interruptions
which
prevented
his
looking
clearly
at
reality
more
and
more
definitely
he
realized
he
wanted
to
get
away
and
think
his
former
life
of
research
became
invested
with
an
effect
of
immense
dignity
and
of
a
steadfast
singleness
of
purpose
but
trafford
was
following
his
own
lights
upon
his
own
lines
he
was
returning
to
that
faith
in
the
supreme
importance
of
thought
and
knowledge
upon
which
he
had
turned
his
back
when
he
left
pure
research
behind
him
to
that
familiar
end
he
came
by
an
unfamiliar
route
after
his
long
unsatisfying
examination
of
social
reform
movements
and
social
and
political
theories
immaturity
haste
and
presumption
vitiated
all
that
region
and
it
seemed
to
him
less
and
less
disputable
that
the
only
escape
for
mankind
from
a
continuing
extravagant
futility
lay
through
the
attainment
of
a
quite
unprecedented
starkness
and
thoroughness
of
thinking
about
all
these
questions
this
conception
of
a
needed
renascence
obsessed
him
more
and
more
and
the
persuasion
deeply
felt
if
indistinctly
apprehended
that
somewhere
in
such
an
effort
there
was
a
part
for
him
to
play
life
is
too
great
for
us
or
too
petty
it
gives
us
no
tolerable
middle
way
between
baseness
and
greatness
we
must
die
daily
on
the
levels
of
ignoble
compromise
or
perish
tragically
among
the
precipices
on
the
one
hand
is
a
life
unsatisfying
and
secure
a
plane
of
dulled
gratifications
mean
advantages
petty
triumphs
adaptations
acquiescences
and
submissions
and
on
the
other
a
steep
and
terrible
climb
set
with
sharp
stones
and
bramble
thickets
and
the
possibilities
of
grotesque
dislocations
and
the
snares
of
such
temptation
as
comes
only
to
those
whose
minds
have
been
quickened
by
high
desire
and
the
challenge
of
insoluble
problems
and
the
intimations
of
issues
so
complex
and
great
demanding
such
a
nobility
of
purpose
such
a
steadfastness
alertness
and
openness
of
mind
that
they
fill
the
heart
of
man
with
despair
there
were
moods
when
trafford
would
as
people
say
pull
himself
together
and
struggle
with
his
gnawing
discontent
he
would
compare
his
lot
with
that
of
other
men
reproach
himself
for
a
monstrous
greed
and
ingratitude
he
remonstrated
with
himself
as
one
might
remonstrate
with
a
pampered
child
refusing
to
be
entertained
by
a
whole
handsome
nursery
full
of
toys
other
men
did
their
work
in
the
world
methodically
and
decently
did
their
duty
by
their
friends
and
belongings
were
manifestly
patient
through
dullness
steadfastly
cheerful
ready
to
meet
vexations
with
a
humorous
smile
and
grateful
for
orderly
pleasures
was
he
abnormal
or
was
he
in
some
unsuspected
way
unhealthy
trafford
neglected
no
possible
explanations
did
he
want
this
great
renascence
of
the
human
mind
because
he
was
suffering
from
some
subtle
form
of
indigestion
he
invoked
independently
of
each
other
the
aid
of
two
distinguished
specialists
they
both
told
him
in
exactly
the
same
voice
and
with
exactly
the
same
air
of
guineas
well
earned
what
you
want
trafford
is
a
change
trafford
brought
his
mind
to
bear
upon
the
instances
of
contentment
about
him
he
developed
an
opinion
that
all
men
and
many
women
were
potentially
at
least
as
restless
as
himself
a
huge
proportion
of
the
usage
and
education
in
modern
life
struck
upon
him
now
as
being
a
training
in
contentment
or
rather
in
keeping
quiet
and
not
upsetting
things
the
serious
and
responsible
life
of
an
ordinary
prosperous
man
fulfilling
the
requirements
of
our
social
organization
fatigues
and
neither
completely
satisfies
nor
completely
occupies
still
less
does
the
responsible
part
of
the
life
of
a
woman
of
the
prosperous
classes
engage
all
her
energies
or
hold
her
imagination
and
there
has
grown
up
a
great
informal
organization
of
employments
games
ceremonies
social
routines
travel
to
consume
these
surplus
powers
and
excessive
cravings
which
might
otherwise
change
or
shatter
the
whole
order
of
human
living
he
began
to
understand
the
forced
preoccupation
with
cricket
and
golf
the
shooting
visiting
and
so
forth
to
which
the
young
people
of
the
economically
free
classes
in
the
community
are
trained
he
discovered
a
theory
for
hobbies
and
specialized
interests
he
began
to
see
why
people
go
to
scotland
to
get
away
from
london
and
come
to
london
to
get
away
from
scotland
why
they
crowd
to
and
fro
along
the
riviera
swarm
over
switzerland
shoot
yacht
hunt
and
maintain
an
immense
apparatus
of
racing
and
motoring
because
so
they
are
able
to
remain
reasonably
contented
with
the
world
as
it
is
he
perceived
too
that
a
man
who
has
missed
or
broken
through
the
training
to
this
kind
of
life
does
not
again
very
readily
subdue
himself
to
the
security
of
these
systematized
distractions
his
own
upbringing
had
been
antipathetic
to
any
such
adaptations
his
years
of
research
had
given
him
the
habit
of
naked
intimacy
with
truth
filled
him
with
a
craving
for
reality
and
the
destructive
acids
of
a
relentless
critical
method
he
began
to
understand
something
of
the
psychology
of
vice
to
comprehend
how
small
a
part
mere
sensuality
how
large
a
part
the
spirit
of
adventure
and
the
craving
for
illegality
may
play
in
the
career
of
those
who
are
called
evil
livers
mere
animal
impulses
and
curiosities
it
had
always
seemed
possible
to
him
to
control
but
now
he
was
beginning
to
apprehend
the
power
of
that
passion
for
escape
at
any
cost
in
any
way
from
the
petty
weakly
stimulating
competitive
motives
of
and
prosperity
for
a
time
trafford
made
an
earnest
effort
to
adjust
himself
to
the
position
in
which
he
found
himself
and
make
a
working
compromise
with
his
disturbing
forces
he
tried
to
pick
up
the
scientific
preoccupation
of
his
earlier
years
he
made
extensive
schemes
to
solomonson
great
concern
whereby
he
might
to
a
large
extent
disentangle
himself
from
business
he
began
to
hunt
out
forgotten
and
yellowing
sheets
of
memoranda
he
found
the
resumption
of
research
much
more
difficult
than
he
had
ever
supposed
possible
he
went
so
far
as
to
plan
a
laboratory
and
to
make
some
inquiries
as
to
site
and
the
cost
of
building
to
the
great
satisfaction
not
only
of
marjorie
but
of
his
mother
old
trafford
had
never
expressed
her
concern
at
his
abandonment
of
molecular
physics
for
but
now
in
her
appreciation
of
his
return
to
pure
investigation
she
betrayed
her
sense
of
his
departure
but
in
his
heart
he
felt
that
this
methodical
establishment
of
virtue
by
limitation
would
not
suffice
for
him
he
said
no
word
of
this
scepticism
as
it
grew
in
his
mind
marjorie
was
still
under
the
impression
that
he
was
returning
to
research
and
that
she
was
free
to
contrive
the
steady
preparation
for
that
happier
day
when
he
should
assume
his
political
inheritance
and
then
presently
a
queer
little
dispute
sprang
up
between
them
suddenly
for
the
first
time
since
he
took
to
business
trafford
found
himself
limiting
her
again
she
was
disposed
partly
through
the
natural
growth
of
her
circle
and
her
setting
and
partly
through
a
movement
on
the
part
of
halford
wallace
to
move
from
sussex
square
into
a
larger
more
picturesquely
built
house
in
a
more
central
position
she
particularly
desired
a
good
staircase
he
met
her
intimations
of
this
development
with
a
curious
and
unusual
irritation
the
idea
of
moving
bothered
him
he
felt
that
exaggerated
annoyance
which
is
so
often
a
concomitant
of
overwrought
nerves
they
had
a
dispute
that
was
almost
a
quarrel
and
though
marjorie
dropped
the
matter
for
a
time
he
could
feel
she
was
still
at
work
upon
it
chapter
the
second
trafford
decides
to
go
a
haunting
desire
to
go
away
into
solitude
grew
upon
trafford
very
steadily
he
wanted
intensely
to
think
and
london
and
marjorie
would
not
let
him
think
he
wanted
therefore
to
go
away
out
of
london
and
marjorie
world
he
wanted
he
felt
to
go
away
alone
and
face
god
and
clear
things
up
in
his
mind
by
imperceptible
degrees
this
desire
anticipated
its
realization
his
activities
were
affected
more
and
more
by
intimations
of
a
determined
crisis
one
eventful
day
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
mind
passed
quite
suddenly
from
desire
to
resolve
he
found
himself
with
a
project
already
broadly
definite
hitherto
he
been
at
all
clear
where
he
could
go
from
the
first
almost
he
had
felt
that
this
change
he
needed
the
change
by
which
he
was
to
get
out
of
the
thickets
of
work
and
perplexity
and
distraction
that
held
him
captive
must
be
a
physical
as
well
as
a
mental
removal
he
must
go
somewhere
still
and
isolated
where
sustained
detached
thinking
was
possible
his
preference
if
he
had
one
inclined
him
to
some
solitude
among
the
himalaya
mountains
that
came
perhaps
from
kim
and
the
precedent
of
the
hindoo
religious
retreat
from
the
world
but
this
retreat
he
contemplated
was
a
retreat
that
aimed
at
a
return
a
clarified
and
strengthened
resumption
of
the
world
and
then
suddenly
as
if
he
had
always
intended
it
labrador
flashed
through
his
thoughts
like
a
familiar
name
that
had
been
for
a
time
quite
unaccountably
forgotten
the
word
labrador
drifted
to
him
one
day
from
an
adjacent
table
as
he
sat
alone
at
lunch
in
the
liberal
union
club
some
bore
was
reciting
the
substance
of
a
lecture
to
a
seems
to
be
a
remarkable
country
said
the
speaker
mineral
wealth
hardly
glanced
at
you
know
furs
and
a
few
score
indians
and
at
our
doors
practically
at
our
doors
trafford
ceased
to
listen
his
mind
was
taking
up
this
idea
of
labrador
he
wondered
why
he
had
not
thought
of
labrador
before
he
had
two
or
three
streams
of
thought
flowing
in
his
mind
as
a
man
who
muses
alone
is
apt
to
do
marjorie
desire
to
move
had
reappeared
a
particular
group
of
houses
between
berkeley
square
and
park
lane
had
taken
hold
of
her
fancy
she
had
urged
the
acquisition
of
one
upon
him
that
morning
and
this
kept
coming
up
into
consciousness
like
a
wrong
thread
in
a
tapestry
moreover
he
was
watching
his
with
a
critical
rather
than
a
friendly
eye
a
contemplation
of
his
habitual
associates
was
one
of
the
queer
aspects
of
this
period
of
unsettlement
they
exasperated
him
by
their
massive
contentment
with
the
surface
of
things
they
came
in
one
after
another
patting
their
ties
or
pulling
at
the
lapels
of
their
coats
and
looked
about
them
for
vacant
places
with
a
conscious
ease
of
manner
that
irritated
his
nerves
no
doubt
they
were
all
more
or
less
successful
and
distinguished
men
matter
for
conversation
and
food
for
anecdotes
but
why
did
they
trouble
to
give
themselves
the
air
of
it
they
halted
or
sat
down
by
friends
enunciated
vapid
remarks
in
sonorous
voices
and
opened
conversations
in
trite
phrases
about
london
architecture
about
the
political
situation
or
the
morning
newspaper
conversations
that
ought
he
felt
to
have
been
thrown
away
unopened
so
stale
and
needless
they
seemed
to
him
they
were
judges
lawyers
of
all
sorts
bankers
company
promoters
railway
managers
stockbrokers
pressmen
politicians
men
of
leisure
he
wondered
if
indeed
they
were
as
opaque
as
they
seemed
wondered
with
the
helpless
wonder
of
a
man
of
exceptional
mental
gifts
whether
any
of
them
at
any
stage
had
had
such
thoughts
as
his
had
wanted
as
acutely
as
he
did
now
to
get
right
out
of
the
world
did
old
booch
over
there
for
example
guzzling
oysters
cry
at
times
upon
the
unknown
god
in
the
vast
silences
of
the
night
but
booch
of
course
was
a
member
or
something
of
the
house
of
laymen
and
very
sound
on
the
articles
a
man
who
ate
oysters
like
that
could
swallow
anything
and
in
the
vast
silences
of
the
night
he
was
probably
heavily
and
noisily
asleep
blenkins
the
gentlemanly
colleague
of
denton
in
the
control
of
the
country
appeared
on
his
way
to
the
gesticulating
amiably
to
any
possible
friend
trafford
returned
his
salutation
and
pulled
himself
together
immediately
after
in
fear
that
he
had
scowled
for
he
hated
to
be
churlish
to
any
human
being
blenkins
too
it
might
be
had
sorrow
and
remorse
and
periods
of
passionate
and
maybe
blenkins
could
weep
salt
tears
as
blenkins
no
doubt
under
suitable
would
reveal
heart
and
viscera
as
quivering
and
oozy
as
any
man
but
to
trafford
jaundiced
eyes
just
then
it
seemed
that
if
you
slashed
blenkins
across
he
would
probably
cut
like
a
cheese
now
in
labrador
so
soon
as
blenkins
had
cleared
trafford
followed
him
to
the
and
went
on
upstairs
to
the
thinking
of
labrador
long
ago
he
had
read
the
story
of
wallace
and
hubbard
in
that
wilderness
there
was
much
to
be
said
for
a
winter
in
labrador
it
was
cold
it
was
clear
infinitely
lonely
with
a
keen
edge
of
danger
and
hardship
and
never
a
letter
or
a
paper
one
could
provision
a
hut
and
sit
wrapped
in
fur
watching
the
northern
lights
i
off
to
labrador
said
trafford
and
entered
the
it
was
after
all
perfectly
easy
to
go
to
labrador
one
had
just
to
go
as
he
pinched
the
end
of
his
cigar
he
became
aware
of
blenkins
with
a
gleam
of
golden
glasses
and
a
flapping
white
cuff
beckoning
across
the
room
to
him
with
that
probable
scowl
on
his
conscience
trafford
was
moved
to
respond
with
an
unreal
warmth
and
strolled
across
to
blenkins
and
a
group
of
three
or
four
other
people
including
that
vigorous
young
politician
weston
massinghay
and
hart
about
the
further
fireplace
we
were
talking
of
you
said
blenkins
come
and
sit
down
with
us
why
do
you
come
into
parliament
i
just
arranged
to
go
for
some
months
to
labrador
industrial
development
asked
blenkins
all
alive
no
holiday
no
blenkins
believes
that
sort
of
thing
but
of
course
if
trafford
chose
to
keep
his
own
counsel
well
come
into
parliament
as
soon
as
you
get
back
trafford
had
had
that
old
conversation
before
he
pretended
insensibility
when
blenkins
gestured
to
a
vacant
chair
no
he
said
still
standing
we
settled
all
that
and
now
i
up
to
my
neck
in
detail
about
labrador
i
shall
be
starting
before
the
month
is
out
blenkins
and
hart
simulated
interest
it
immoral
said
blenkins
for
a
man
of
your
standing
to
keep
out
of
politics
it
more
than
immoral
said
hart
it
american
solomonson
comes
in
to
represent
the
firm
smiled
trafford
signalled
the
waiter
for
coffee
and
presently
disentangled
himself
from
their
company
for
blenkins
trafford
concealed
an
exquisite
dislike
and
contempt
and
blenkins
had
a
considerable
admiration
for
trafford
based
on
extensive
misunderstandings
blenkins
admired
trafford
because
he
was
and
with
a
beautiful
and
successful
wife
because
he
had
become
reasonably
rich
very
quickly
and
easily
was
young
and
a
fellow
of
the
royal
society
with
a
reputation
that
echoed
in
berlin
and
very
perceptibly
did
not
return
blenkins
admiration
all
these
things
filled
blenkins
with
a
desire
for
trafford
intimacy
and
to
become
the
associate
of
the
very
promising
political
career
that
it
seemed
to
him
in
spite
of
trafford
repudiations
was
the
natural
next
step
in
a
deliberately
and
honourably
planned
life
he
mistook
trafford
silences
and
detachment
for
the
marks
of
a
strong
silent
man
who
was
scheming
the
immense
vulgar
achievements
that
appeal
to
the
blenkins
mind
blenkins
was
a
sentimentally
loyal
party
liberal
and
as
he
said
at
times
to
hart
and
weston
massinghay
if
those
other
fellows
get
hold
of
him
blenkins
was
the
fine
flower
of
oxford
liberalism
and
the
tennysonian
days
he
wanted
to
be
like
king
arthur
and
sir
galahad
with
the
merest
touch
of
launcelot
and
to
be
perfectly
upright
and
splendid
and
very
very
successful
he
was
a
fair
tenoring
sort
of
person
with
an
arthurian
moustache
and
a
disposition
to
long
frock
coats
it
had
been
said
of
him
that
he
did
dress
like
a
gentleman
but
that
he
dressed
more
like
a
gentleman
than
a
gentleman
ought
to
dress
it
might
have
been
added
that
he
did
behave
like
a
gentleman
but
that
he
behaved
more
like
a
gentleman
than
a
gentleman
ought
to
behave
he
did
think
but
he
talked
and
he
wrote
more
thoughtfully
in
his
leaders
and
in
the
little
dialogues
he
wrote
in
imitation
of
sir
arthur
helps
than
any
other
person
who
did
think
could
possibly
do
he
was
an
orthodox
churchman
but
very
very
broad
he
held
all
the
doctrines
a
distinguished
sort
of
thing
to
do
in
an
age
of
doubt
but
there
was
a
quality
about
them
as
he
held
them
as
though
they
had
been
run
over
by
something
rather
heavy
it
was
a
flattened
and
slightly
obliterated
breadth
nothing
was
assertive
but
nothing
under
examination
proved
to
be
altogether
gone
his
profuse
thoughtfulness
was
not
confined
to
his
journalistic
and
literary
work
it
overflowed
into
talks
he
was
a
man
for
great
talks
interminable
rambling
floods
of
boyish
observation
emotional
appreciation
and
silly
sapient
comment
he
loved
to
discuss
who
are
the
best
talkers
now
alive
he
had
written
an
essay
in
the
he
boasted
of
when
the
talk
had
gone
on
from
the
moment
of
meeting
in
the
train
to
the
moment
of
parting
at
euston
or
paddington
or
waterloo
and
one
or
two
hostesses
with
embittered
memories
could
verify
his
boasting
he
did
his
best
to
make
the
club
a
talking
club
and
loved
to
summon
men
to
a
growing
circle
of
chairs
trafford
had
been
involved
in
talks
on
one
or
two
occasions
and
now
as
he
sat
alone
in
the
corridor
and
smoked
and
drank
his
coffee
he
could
imagine
the
talk
he
had
escaped
the
talk
that
was
going
on
in
the
smoking
room
the
platitudes
the
sagacities
the
digressions
the
sudden
revelation
of
deep
irrational
convictions
he
reflected
upon
the
various
talks
at
which
he
had
assisted
his
chief
impression
of
them
all
was
of
an
intolerable
fluidity
never
once
had
he
known
a
talk
thicken
to
adequate
discussion
never
had
a
new
idea
or
a
new
view
come
to
him
in
a
talk
he
wondered
why
blenkins
and
his
like
talked
at
all
essentially
they
lived
for
pose
not
for
expression
they
did
not
greatly
desire
to
discover
make
or
be
they
wanted
to
seem
and
succeed
talking
perhaps
was
part
of
their
pose
of
great
intellectual
activity
and
blenkins
was
fortunate
to
have
an
easy
unforced
running
of
mind
over
his
cigar
trafford
became
profoundly
philosophical
about
talk
and
after
the
manner
of
those
who
become
profoundly
philosophical
he
spread
out
the
word
beyond
its
original
and
proper
intentions
to
all
sorts
of
kindred
and
parallel
things
blenkins
and
his
miscellany
of
friends
in
their
circle
of
chairs
were
after
all
only
a
crude
rendering
of
very
much
of
intellectual
activity
of
mankind
men
talked
so
often
as
dogs
bark
those
talkers
never
came
to
grips
fell
away
from
topic
to
topic
pretended
depth
and
evaded
the
devastating
horrors
of
sincerity
listening
was
a
politeness
amongst
them
that
was
presently
rewarded
with
utterance
tremendously
like
dogs
they
were
in
a
neighborhood
on
a
summer
afternoon
fluidity
excessive
abundance
inconsecutiveness
these
were
the
things
that
made
talk
hateful
to
trafford
was
most
literature
in
the
same
class
was
nearly
all
present
philosophical
and
sociological
discussion
in
the
world
merely
a
blenkins
circle
on
a
colossal
scale
with
every
one
looming
forward
to
get
in
a
deeply
thoughtful
word
edgeways
at
the
first
opportunity
imagine
any
one
in
distress
about
his
soul
or
about
mankind
going
to
a
professor
of
economics
or
sociology
or
philosophy
he
thought
of
the
endless
big
expensive
fruitless
books
the
windy
expansions
of
industrious
pedantry
that
mocked
the
spirit
of
inquiry
the
fields
of
physical
and
biological
science
alone
had
been
partially
rescued
from
the
floods
of
human
inconsecutiveness
there
at
least
a
man
must
on
the
whole
join
on
to
the
work
of
other
men
stand
a
searching
criticism
justify
himself
philosophically
this
was
an
age
of
relaxed
schoolmen
he
thought
of
doctor
codger
at
cambridge
bubbling
away
with
his
iridescent
hegelianism
like
a
salted
snail
of
doctor
quiller
at
oxford
ignoring
bergson
and
fulminating
a
preposterous
insular
pragmatism
each
contradicted
the
other
fundamentally
upon
matters
of
universal
concern
neither
ever
joined
issue
with
the
other
why
in
the
name
of
humanity
did
some
one
take
hold
of
those
two
excellent
gentlemen
and
bang
their
busy
heads
together
hard
and
frequently
until
they
either
compromised
or
cracked
he
forgot
these
rambling
speculations
as
he
came
out
into
the
spring
sunshine
of
pall
mall
and
halting
for
a
moment
on
the
topmost
step
regarded
the
tidy
pavements
the
rare
dignified
shops
the
waiting
taxicabs
the
pleasant
prosperous
his
mind
lapsed
back
to
the
thought
that
he
meant
to
leave
all
this
and
go
to
labrador
his
mind
went
a
step
further
and
reflected
that
he
would
not
only
go
to
labrador
but
it
was
highly
probable
come
back
again
and
then
why
after
all
should
he
go
to
labrador
at
all
why
should
he
make
a
supreme
effort
here
something
entirely
irrational
within
him
told
him
with
conclusive
emphasis
that
he
had
to
go
to
labrador
he
remembered
there
was
this
confounded
business
of
the
proposed
house
in
mayfair
to
consider
it
occurred
to
him
that
he
would
go
a
little
out
of
his
way
and
look
at
the
new
great
laboratories
at
the
romeike
college
of
which
his
old
durgan
was
he
knew
extravagantly
proud
romeike
widow
was
dead
now
and
her
will
executed
and
her
substance
half
turned
already
to
bricks
and
stone
and
glazed
tiles
and
all
those
excesses
of
space
and
appliance
which
the
rich
and
authoritative
imagine
must
needs
give
us
science
however
and
underpaid
and
slighted
the
users
of
those
opportunities
may
be
the
architects
had
had
great
fun
with
the
bequest
a
quarter
of
the
site
was
devoted
to
a
huge
square
surrounded
by
dignified
if
functionless
colonnades
and
adorned
with
those
stone
seats
of
honour
which
are
always
so
chill
and
unsatisfactory
as
resting
places
in
our
island
climate
the
laboratories
except
that
they
were
a
little
shaded
by
the
colonnades
were
everything
a
laboratory
should
be
the
benches
were
miracles
of
convenience
there
was
anything
the
industrious
investigator
might
want
steam
high
pressures
electric
power
that
he
could
get
by
pressing
a
button
or
turning
a
switch
unless
perhaps
it
was
inspiring
ideas
and
the
new
library
at
the
end
with
its
greys
and
greens
its
logarithmic
computators
at
every
table
was
a
miracle
of
mental
convenience
durgan
showed
his
old
professor
the
marvels
if
he
to
do
something
here
said
durgan
not
too
hopefully
a
man
can
what
become
of
the
little
old
room
where
we
two
used
to
work
asked
trafford
they
turn
all
out
presently
said
durgan
when
this
part
is
ready
but
just
at
present
it
very
much
as
you
left
it
there
been
precious
little
research
done
there
since
you
went
away
not
what
call
research
females
chiefly
and
boys
playing
at
it
making
themselves
into
by
a
baby
research
instead
of
a
examination
it
like
broaching
a
gallon
cask
full
of
pap
to
think
of
it
lord
sir
the
swill
research
counting
and
weighing
things
professor
lake
all
right
i
suppose
but
his
work
was
mostly
mathematical
he
did
do
much
of
it
here
no
the
old
days
ended
sir
when
you
he
arrested
himself
and
obviously
changed
his
words
got
busy
with
other
things
trafford
surveyed
the
place
it
seemed
to
him
to
have
shrunken
a
little
in
the
course
of
the
three
years
that
had
intervened
since
he
resigned
his
position
on
the
wall
at
the
back
there
still
hung
and
a
little
crumpled
an
old
table
of
constants
he
had
made
for
his
elasticity
researches
lake
had
kept
it
there
for
lake
was
a
man
of
generous
appreciations
and
rather
proud
to
follow
in
the
footsteps
of
an
investigator
of
trafford
subtlety
and
vigor
the
old
sink
in
the
corner
where
trafford
had
once
swilled
his
watch
glasses
and
filled
his
beakers
had
been
replaced
by
one
of
a
more
modern
construction
and
the
combustion
cupboard
was
unfamiliar
until
durgan
pointed
out
that
it
had
been
enlarged
the
window
at
the
east
end
showed
still
the
marks
of
an
explosion
that
had
banished
a
clumsy
student
from
this
sanctuary
at
the
very
beginning
of
trafford
career
by
jove
he
said
after
a
silence
but
i
did
some
good
work
here
you
did
sir
said
durgan
i
wonder
i
may
take
it
up
again
presently
i
doubt
it
sir
said
durgan
oh
but
suppose
i
come
back
i
do
think
you
would
find
yourself
coming
back
sir
said
durgan
after
judicious
consideration
he
adduced
no
shadow
of
a
reason
for
his
doubt
but
some
mysterious
quality
in
his
words
carried
conviction
to
trafford
mind
he
knew
that
he
would
never
do
anything
worth
doing
in
molecular
physics
again
he
knew
it
now
conclusively
for
the
first
time
he
found
himself
presently
in
bond
street
the
bright
may
day
had
brought
out
great
quantities
of
people
so
that
he
had
to
come
down
from
altitudes
of
abstraction
to
pick
his
way
among
them
he
was
struck
by
the
prevailing
interest
and
contentment
in
the
faces
he
passed
there
was
no
sense
of
insecurity
betrayed
no
sense
of
the
deeps
and
mysteries
upon
which
our
being
floats
like
a
film
they
looked
solid
they
looked
satisfied
surely
never
before
in
the
history
of
the
world
has
there
been
so
great
a
multitude
of
uninquiring
people
as
there
is
all
the
tragic
great
things
of
life
seem
stupendously
remote
from
them
pain
is
rare
death
is
out
of
sight
religion
has
shrunken
to
an
inconsiderable
comfortable
reassuring
appendage
of
the
daily
life
and
with
the
bright
small
things
of
immediacy
they
are
so
active
and
alert
never
before
has
the
world
seen
such
multitudes
and
a
day
must
come
when
it
will
cease
to
see
them
for
evermore
as
he
shouldered
his
way
through
the
throng
before
the
oxford
street
shop
windows
he
appreciated
a
queer
effect
almost
as
it
were
of
insanity
about
all
this
rich
and
abundant
and
ultimately
aimless
life
this
tremendous
spawning
and
proliferation
of
uneventful
humanity
these
individual
lives
signified
no
doubt
enormously
to
the
individuals
but
did
all
the
shining
reflecting
changing
existence
that
went
by
like
bubbles
in
a
stream
signify
collectively
anything
more
than
the
leaping
glittering
confusion
of
shoaling
mackerel
on
a
sunlit
afternoon
the
pretty
girl
looking
into
the
window
schemed
picturesque
achievements
with
lace
and
ribbon
the
beggar
at
the
curb
was
alert
for
any
sympathetic
eye
the
chauffeur
on
the
waiting
watched
the
twopences
ticking
on
with
a
quiet
satisfaction
each
followed
a
keenly
sought
immediate
end
but
altogether
where
were
they
going
altogether
until
he
knew
that
where
was
the
sanity
of
statecraft
the
excuse
of
any
impersonal
effort
the
significance
of
anything
beyond
a
life
of
appetites
and
instincts
he
found
that
perplexing
suspicion
of
priggishness
affecting
him
again
why
could
he
take
the
gift
of
life
as
it
seemed
these
people
took
it
why
was
he
continually
lapsing
into
these
sombre
dimly
religious
questionings
and
doubts
why
after
all
should
he
concern
himself
with
these
riddles
of
some
collective
and
ultimate
meaning
in
things
was
he
for
all
his
ability
and
security
so
afraid
of
the
accidents
of
life
that
on
that
account
he
clung
to
this
conception
of
a
larger
impersonal
issue
which
the
world
in
general
seemed
to
have
abandoned
so
cheerfully
at
any
rate
he
did
cling
to
it
and
his
sense
of
it
made
the
abounding
active
life
of
this
stirring
bristling
thoroughfare
an
almost
unendurable
perplexity
by
the
marble
arch
a
little
crowd
had
gathered
at
the
pavement
edge
he
remarked
other
little
knots
towards
paddington
and
then
still
others
and
inquiring
found
the
king
was
presently
to
pass
they
promised
themselves
the
gratification
of
seeing
the
king
go
by
they
would
see
a
carriage
they
would
see
horses
and
coachmen
perhaps
even
they
might
catch
sight
of
a
raised
hat
and
a
bowing
figure
and
this
would
be
a
gratification
to
them
it
would
irradiate
the
day
with
a
sense
of
experiences
exceptional
and
precious
for
that
some
of
them
had
already
been
standing
about
for
two
or
three
hours
he
thought
of
these
waiting
people
for
a
time
and
then
he
fell
into
a
speculation
about
the
king
he
wondered
if
the
king
ever
lay
awake
at
three
in
the
morning
and
faced
the
riddle
of
the
eternities
or
whether
he
did
really
take
himself
seriously
and
contentedly
as
being
in
himself
the
vital
function
of
the
state
performed
his
ceremonies
went
hither
and
thither
through
a
wilderness
of
gaping
watchers
slept
well
on
it
was
the
man
satisfied
was
he
satisfied
with
his
empire
as
it
was
and
himself
as
he
was
or
did
some
vision
some
high
ironical
intimation
of
the
latent
and
lost
possibilities
of
his
empire
and
of
the
world
of
things
conceivable
that
lies
beyond
the
poor
tawdry
splendours
of
our
present
loyalties
ever
dawn
upon
him
trafford
imagination
conjured
up
a
sleepless
king
emperor
agonizing
for
humanity
he
turned
to
his
right
out
of
lancaster
gate
into
sussex
square
and
came
to
a
stop
at
the
pavement
edge
from
across
the
road
he
surveyed
the
wide
white
front
and
portals
of
the
house
that
was
big
enough
for
marjorie
he
let
himself
in
with
his
latchkey
malcolm
his
man
hovered
at
the
foot
of
the
staircase
and
came
forward
for
his
hat
and
gloves
and
stick
trafford
in
asked
trafford
she
said
she
would
be
in
by
four
sir
trafford
glanced
at
his
watch
and
went
slowly
upstairs
on
the
landing
there
had
been
a
rearrangement
of
the
furniture
and
he
paused
to
survey
it
the
alterations
had
been
made
to
accommodate
a
big
cloisonné
jar
that
now
glowed
a
wonder
of
white
and
tinted
whites
and
luminous
blues
upon
a
dark
stand
he
noted
now
the
curtain
of
the
window
had
been
changed
from
something
surely
it
had
been
a
reddish
curtain
to
a
sharp
clear
blue
with
a
black
border
that
reflected
upon
and
sustained
and
encouraged
the
jar
tremendously
and
the
wall
behind
yes
its
deep
brown
was
darkened
to
an
absolute
black
behind
the
jar
and
shaded
up
between
the
lacquer
cabinets
on
either
hand
by
insensible
degrees
to
the
general
hue
it
was
wonderful
perfectly
harmonious
and
so
subtly
planned
that
it
seemed
it
all
might
have
grown
as
flowers
grow
he
entered
the
and
surveyed
its
long
and
handsome
spaces
was
over
and
gone
three
long
pictures
by
young
rogerson
and
one
of
redwood
gallant
bronzes
faced
the
tall
windows
between
the
white
marble
fireplaces
at
either
end
there
were
two
lean
jars
from
india
a
young
boy
head
from
florence
and
in
a
great
bowl
in
the
remotest
corner
a
radiant
mass
of
azaleas
his
mood
of
wondering
at
familiar
things
was
still
upon
him
it
came
to
him
as
a
thing
absurd
and
incongruous
that
this
should
be
his
home
it
was
all
wonderfully
arranged
into
one
dignified
harmony
but
he
felt
now
that
at
a
touch
of
social
earthquake
with
a
mere
momentary
lapse
towards
disorder
it
would
degenerate
altogether
into
litter
lie
heaped
together
confessed
the
loot
it
was
he
came
to
a
stop
opposite
one
of
the
rogersons
a
stiffly
shop
girl
in
her
sunday
clothes
a
not
unsuccessful
emulation
of
nicholson
wonderful
stafford
of
paradise
row
regarded
as
so
much
brown
and
grey
and
it
was
coherent
in
marjorie
design
but
regarded
as
a
work
of
art
as
a
piece
of
expression
how
madly
irrelevant
was
its
humour
and
implications
to
that
room
and
the
purposes
of
that
room
rogerson
was
perhaps
trying
to
say
much
but
at
any
rate
he
was
trying
to
say
something
and
redwood
too
was
asserting
freedom
and
adventure
and
the
thought
of
that
florentine
of
the
bust
and
the
patient
careful
indian
potter
and
every
maker
of
all
the
little
casual
articles
about
him
produced
an
effect
of
muffled
stifled
assertions
against
this
subdued
and
disciplined
background
of
muted
inarticulate
cries
cries
for
beauty
for
delight
for
freedom
marjorie
and
her
world
moved
and
rustled
and
chattered
and
competed
wearing
the
skins
of
beasts
the
of
birds
the
woven
cocoon
cases
of
little
silkworms
preposterous
he
whispered
he
went
to
the
window
and
stared
out
turned
about
and
regarded
the
gracious
variety
of
that
long
room
again
then
strolled
thoughtfully
upstairs
he
reached
the
door
of
his
study
and
a
sound
of
voices
from
the
schoolroom
it
had
recently
been
promoted
from
the
rank
of
day
nursery
to
this
level
caught
his
mood
he
changed
his
mind
crossed
the
landing
and
was
welcomed
with
shouts
the
rogues
had
been
dressing
up
margharita
that
child
of
the
dreadful
dawn
was
now
a
sturdy
and
domineering
girl
of
eight
and
she
was
attired
in
a
gilt
paper
mitre
and
her
governess
white
muslin
blouse
so
tied
at
the
wrists
as
to
suggest
long
sleeves
a
broad
crimson
band
doing
duty
as
a
stole
she
was
becket
prepared
for
martyrdom
at
the
foot
of
the
altar
godwin
his
eldest
son
was
a
pleasantly
boy
of
nearly
seven
and
very
happy
now
in
a
white
dragoon
helmet
and
rude
but
effective
brown
paper
breastplate
and
greaves
as
the
party
of
assassin
knights
a
small
acolyte
in
what
was
in
all
human
probably
one
of
the
governess
more
intimate
linen
garments
assisted
becket
while
the
general
congregation
of
canterbury
was
represented
by
edward
aged
two
and
the
governess
disguised
with
a
union
jack
tied
over
her
head
after
the
fashion
of
the
middle
ages
after
the
children
had
welcomed
their
father
and
explained
the
bloody
work
in
hand
they
returned
to
it
with
solemn
earnestness
while
trafford
surveyed
the
tragedy
godwin
slew
with
admirable
gusto
and
i
doubt
if
the
actual
thomas
of
canterbury
showed
half
the
stately
dignity
of
margharita
the
scene
finished
they
went
on
to
the
penance
of
henry
the
second
and
there
was
a
tremendous
readjustment
of
costumes
with
much
consultation
and
secrecy
trafford
eyes
went
from
his
offspring
to
the
long
room
with
its
gay
frieze
of
ships
and
gulls
and
its
cork
carpet
of
plain
brick
red
everywhere
it
showed
his
wife
quick
cleverness
the
clean
serviceable
decorativeness
of
it
all
the
pretty
patterned
window
curtains
the
writing
desks
the
little
library
of
books
the
flowers
and
bulbs
in
glasses
the
counting
blocks
and
bricks
and
jolly
toys
the
blackboard
on
which
the
children
learnt
to
draw
in
bold
wide
strokes
the
big
german
colour
prints
upon
the
walls
and
the
children
did
credit
to
their
casket
they
were
not
only
full
of
vitality
but
full
of
ideas
even
edward
was
already
a
person
of
conversation
they
were
good
stuff
anyhow
it
was
fine
in
a
sense
trafford
thought
to
have
given
up
his
own
motives
and
curiosities
to
afford
this
airy
pleasantness
of
upbringing
for
them
and
then
came
a
qualifying
thought
would
they
in
their
turn
for
the
sake
of
another
generation
have
to
give
up
fine
occupations
for
mean
occupations
deep
thoughts
for
shallow
would
the
world
get
them
in
turn
would
the
girls
be
hustled
and
flattered
into
advantageous
marriages
that
dinners
and
might
still
prevail
would
the
boys
after
this
gracious
beginning
presently
have
to
swim
submerged
in
another
generation
of
blenkinses
and
their
talk
toil
in
arduous
observe
respect
and
manipulate
shams
succeed
or
fail
and
succeeding
beget
amidst
hope
and
beautiful
emotions
yet
another
generation
doomed
to
insincerities
and
accommodations
and
so
die
at
last
as
he
must
die
he
heard
his
wife
clear
voice
in
the
hall
below
and
went
down
to
meet
her
she
had
gone
into
the
and
he
followed
her
in
and
through
the
folding
doors
to
the
hinder
part
of
the
room
where
she
stood
ready
to
open
a
small
bureau
she
turned
at
his
approach
and
smiled
a
pleasant
habitual
smile
she
was
no
longer
the
slim
girl
who
had
come
out
of
the
world
to
him
when
he
crawled
from
beneath
the
wreckage
of
plane
no
longer
the
young
beauty
who
had
been
revealed
to
him
on
the
staircase
of
the
vevey
villa
she
was
now
a
dignified
woman
controlling
her
house
and
her
life
with
a
skilful
subtle
appreciation
of
her
every
point
and
possibility
she
was
wearing
now
a
simple
walking
dress
of
brownish
fawn
colour
and
her
hat
was
touched
with
a
steely
blue
that
made
her
blue
eyes
seem
handsome
and
hard
and
toned
her
hair
to
a
merely
warm
brown
she
had
as
it
were
subdued
her
fine
colours
into
a
sheath
in
order
that
she
might
presently
draw
them
again
with
more
effect
hullo
old
man
she
said
you
home
he
nodded
the
club
bored
me
and
i
could
work
her
voice
had
something
of
a
challenge
and
defiance
in
it
i
been
looking
at
a
house
she
said
alice
carmel
told
me
of
it
it
is
in
berkeley
square
but
it
near
it
it
rather
good
he
met
her
eye
that
premature
he
said
we
ca
go
on
living
in
this
one
i
wo
go
to
another
but
why
i
just
wo
it
is
the
money
no
said
trafford
with
sudden
fierce
resentment
i
overtaken
you
and
beaten
you
there
marjorie
she
stared
at
the
harsh
bitterness
of
his
voice
she
was
about
to
speak
when
the
door
opened
and
malcom
ushered
in
aunt
plessington
and
uncle
hubert
husband
and
wife
hung
for
a
moment
and
then
realized
their
talk
was
at
an
end
marjorie
went
forward
to
greet
her
aunt
careless
now
of
all
that
once
stupendous
influence
might
think
of
her
she
had
long
ceased
to
feel
even
the
triumph
of
victory
in
her
big
house
her
costly
dignified
clothes
her
assured
and
growing
social
importance
for
five
years
aunt
plessington
had
not
even
ventured
to
advise
had
once
or
twice
admired
all
that
business
of
magnet
was
even
elaborately
forgotten
seven
years
of
feverish
had
left
their
mark
upon
both
the
plessingtons
she
was
leaner
more
gauntly
untidy
more
aggressively
she
no
longer
dressed
carelessly
she
defied
the
world
with
her
clothes
waved
her
tattered
and
dingy
banners
in
its
face
uncle
hubert
was
no
fatter
but
in
some
queer
way
he
had
ceased
to
be
thin
like
so
many
people
whose
peripheries
defy
the
manifest
quaint
purpose
of
providence
he
was
in
a
state
of
thwarted
adiposity
and
with
all
the
disconnectedness
and
weak
irritability
characteristic
of
his
condition
he
had
developed
a
number
of
nervous
movements
and
incredulous
pawings
at
his
more
salient
features
is
it
a
lark
began
aunt
plessington
with
something
like
a
note
of
apprehension
in
her
highpitched
voice
and
speaking
almost
from
the
doorway
we
making
a
call
together
i
and
hubert
it
an
attack
in
force
uncle
hubert
goggled
in
the
rear
and
stroked
his
chin
and
tried
to
get
together
a
sort
of
facial
expression
the
traffords
made
welcoming
noises
and
marjorie
advanced
to
meet
her
aunt
we
want
you
to
do
something
for
us
said
aunt
plessington
taking
two
hands
with
two
hands
in
the
intervening
years
the
movement
had
had
ups
and
downs
it
had
had
a
boom
which
had
ended
abruptly
in
a
complete
loss
of
voice
for
aunt
plessington
she
had
tried
to
run
it
on
a
patent
food
and
then
it
had
entangled
itself
with
a
new
cult
of
philanthropic
theosophy
from
which
it
had
been
extracted
with
difficulty
and
in
a
damaged
condition
it
had
never
completely
recovered
from
that
unhappy
association
latterly
aunt
plessington
had
lost
her
nerve
and
she
had
taken
to
making
calls
upon
people
with
considerable
and
sometimes
embarrassing
demand
for
support
urging
them
to
join
committees
take
chairs
stake
reputations
speak
and
act
as
foils
for
her
if
they
refused
she
lost
her
temper
very
openly
and
frankly
and
became
industriously
vindictive
she
circulated
scandals
or
created
them
her
old
assurance
had
deserted
her
the
strangulated
contralto
was
losing
its
magic
power
she
felt
in
this
degenerating
england
it
had
ruled
so
long
in
the
last
year
or
so
she
had
become
extremely
snappy
with
uncle
hubert
she
ascribed
much
of
the
movement
futility
to
the
decline
of
his
administrative
powers
and
the
increasing
awkwardness
of
his
gestures
and
she
did
her
utmost
to
keep
him
up
to
the
mark
her
only
method
of
keeping
him
up
to
the
mark
was
to
jerk
the
bit
she
had
now
come
to
compel
marjorie
to
address
a
meeting
that
was
to
inaugurate
a
new
phase
in
the
movement
history
and
she
wanted
marjorie
because
she
particularly
wanted
a
daring
liberal
and
spiritually
amorous
bishop
who
had
once
told
her
with
a
note
of
profound
conviction
that
marjorie
was
a
very
beautiful
woman
she
was
so
intent
upon
her
purpose
that
she
scarcely
noticed
trafford
he
slipped
from
the
room
unobserved
under
cover
of
her
playful
preliminaries
and
went
to
the
untidy
little
apartment
overhead
which
served
in
that
house
as
his
study
he
sat
down
at
the
big
desk
pushed
his
methodically
arranged
papers
back
and
drummed
on
the
edge
with
his
fingers
i
damned
if
we
have
that
bigger
house
said
trafford
he
felt
he
wanted
to
confirm
and
establish
this
new
resolution
to
go
right
away
to
labrador
for
a
year
he
wanted
to
tell
someone
the
thing
definitely
he
would
have
gone
downstairs
again
to
marjorie
but
she
was
submerged
and
swimming
desperately
against
the
voluble
rapids
of
aunt
plessington
purpose
it
might
be
an
hour
before
that
attack
withdrew
presently
there
would
be
other
callers
he
decided
to
have
tea
with
his
mother
and
talk
to
her
about
this
new
break
in
the
course
of
his
life
except
that
her
hair
was
now
grey
and
her
brown
eyes
by
so
much
contrast
brighter
trafford
appearance
had
altered
very
little
in
the
ten
years
of
her
only
son
marriage
whatever
fresh
realizations
of
the
inevitably
widening
separation
between
parent
and
child
these
years
had
brought
her
she
had
kept
to
herself
she
had
watched
her
sometimes
with
sympathy
sometimes
with
perplexity
always
with
a
jealous
resolve
to
let
no
shadow
of
jealousy
fall
between
them
marjorie
had
been
sweet
and
friendly
to
her
but
after
the
first
outburst
of
enthusiastic
affection
she
had
neither
offered
nor
invited
confidences
old
trafford
had
talked
of
marjorie
to
her
son
guardedly
and
had
marked
and
respected
a
growing
indisposition
on
his
part
to
discuss
his
wife
for
a
year
or
so
after
his
marriage
she
had
ached
at
times
with
a
sense
of
nearly
intolerable
loneliness
and
then
the
new
interests
she
had
found
for
herself
had
won
their
way
against
this
depression
the
new
insurrectionary
movement
of
women
that
had
distinguished
those
years
had
attacked
her
by
its
emotion
and
repelled
her
by
its
crudity
and
she
had
resolved
quite
in
the
spirit
of
the
man
who
had
shaped
her
life
to
make
a
systematic
study
of
all
the
contributory
strands
that
met
in
this
difficult
tangle
she
tried
to
write
but
she
found
that
the
poetic
gift
the
gift
of
the
creative
and
illuminating
phrase
which
alone
justifies
writing
was
denied
to
her
and
so
she
sought
to
make
herself
wise
to
read
and
hear
and
discuss
and
think
over
these
things
and
perhaps
at
last
inspire
and
encourage
writing
in
others
her
circle
of
intimates
grew
and
she
presently
remarked
with
a
curious
interest
that
while
she
had
lost
the
confidences
of
her
own
son
and
his
wife
she
was
becoming
the
confidant
of
an
increasing
number
of
other
people
they
came
to
her
she
perceived
because
she
was
receptive
and
sympathetic
and
without
a
claim
upon
them
or
any
interest
to
complicate
the
freedoms
of
their
speech
with
her
they
came
to
her
because
she
did
not
belong
to
them
nor
they
to
her
it
is
indeed
the
defect
of
all
formal
and
established
relationship
that
it
embarrasses
speech
and
taints
each
phase
in
intercourse
with
the
flavour
of
diplomacy
one
can
be
far
more
easily
outspoken
to
a
casual
stranger
one
may
never
see
again
than
to
that
inseparable
other
who
may
misinterpret
who
may
disapprove
or
misunderstand
and
who
will
certainly
in
the
measure
of
that
discord
remember
it
became
at
last
a
matter
of
rejoicing
to
trafford
that
the
ties
of
the
old
instinctive
tenderness
between
herself
and
her
son
the
memories
of
pain
and
tears
and
the
passionate
conflict
of
childhood
were
growing
so
thin
and
lax
and
inconsiderable
that
she
could
even
hope
some
day
to
talk
to
him
again
almost
as
she
talked
to
the
young
men
and
young
women
who
drifted
out
of
the
unknown
to
her
and
sat
in
her
little
room
and
sought
to
express
their
perplexities
and
listened
to
her
advice
it
seemed
to
her
that
afternoon
the
day
had
come
trafford
found
her
just
returned
from
a
walk
in
kensington
gardens
and
writing
a
note
at
her
desk
under
the
narrow
sunlit
window
that
looked
upon
the
high
street
finish
your
letter
little
mother
he
said
and
took
possession
of
the
hearthrug
when
she
had
sealed
and
addressed
her
letter
she
turned
her
head
and
found
him
looking
at
his
father
portrait
done
he
asked
becoming
aware
of
her
eyes
she
took
her
letter
into
the
hall
and
returned
to
him
closing
the
door
behind
her
i
going
away
little
mother
he
said
with
an
unconvincing
i
going
to
take
a
holiday
alone
yes
i
want
a
change
i
going
off
somewhere
untrodden
ground
as
near
as
one
can
get
it
nowadays
labrador
their
eyes
met
for
a
moment
is
it
for
long
the
best
part
of
a
year
i
thought
you
were
going
on
with
your
research
work
again
no
he
paused
i
going
to
labrador
why
she
asked
i
going
to
think
she
found
nothing
to
say
for
a
moment
it
good
she
remarked
to
think
then
lest
she
herself
should
seem
to
be
thinking
too
enormously
she
rang
the
bell
to
order
the
tea
that
was
already
on
its
way
it
surprises
a
mother
she
said
when
the
maid
had
come
and
gone
when
her
son
surprises
her
you
see
he
repeated
as
though
it
explained
everything
i
want
to
think
then
after
a
pause
she
asked
some
questions
about
labrador
was
it
very
cold
very
desert
very
dangerous
and
bitter
and
he
answered
informingly
how
was
he
going
to
stay
there
he
would
go
up
the
country
with
an
expedition
build
a
hut
and
remain
behind
alone
yes
thinking
her
eyes
rested
on
his
face
for
a
time
it
will
be
lonely
she
said
after
a
pause
she
saw
him
as
a
little
still
speck
against
immense
backgrounds
of
snowy
wilderness
the
came
before
mother
and
son
were
back
at
essentials
again
then
she
asked
abruptly
why
are
you
going
away
like
this
i
tired
of
all
this
business
and
finance
he
said
after
a
pause
i
thought
you
would
be
she
answered
as
deliberately
yes
i
had
enough
of
things
i
want
to
get
clear
and
begin
again
somehow
she
felt
they
both
hung
away
from
the
essential
aspect
either
he
or
she
must
approach
it
she
decided
that
she
would
that
it
was
a
less
difficult
thing
for
her
than
for
him
and
marjorie
she
asked
he
looked
into
his
mother
eyes
very
quietly
you
see
he
went
on
deliberately
disregarding
her
question
i
beached
i
aground
spoilt
now
for
the
old
researches
spoilt
altogether
and
i
do
like
this
life
i
leading
i
detest
it
while
i
was
struggling
it
had
a
kind
of
interest
there
was
an
excitement
in
piling
up
the
first
twenty
thousand
but
it
empty
it
aimless
it
incessant
he
paused
she
turned
to
the
and
lit
the
spirit
lamp
under
the
kettle
it
seemed
a
little
difficult
to
do
and
her
hand
trembled
when
she
turned
on
him
again
it
was
with
an
effort
does
marjorie
like
the
life
you
are
leading
she
asked
and
pressed
her
lips
together
tightly
he
spoke
with
a
bitterness
in
his
voice
that
astonished
her
oh
likes
it
are
you
sure
he
nodded
she
wo
like
it
without
you
oh
that
too
much
it
her
world
it
what
she
done
what
made
she
can
have
it
she
can
keep
it
i
played
my
part
and
got
it
for
her
but
now
now
i
free
to
go
i
will
go
she
got
everything
else
i
done
my
half
of
the
bargain
but
my
soul
my
own
if
i
want
to
go
away
and
think
i
will
not
even
marjorie
shall
stand
in
the
way
of
that
she
made
no
answer
to
this
outburst
for
a
couple
of
seconds
then
she
threw
out
why
should
marjorie
think
too
he
considered
that
for
some
moments
she
does
he
said
as
though
the
words
came
from
the
roots
of
his
being
but
you
two
we
do
talk
it
astonishing
how
we
do
we
do
we
ca
we
try
to
and
we
ca
and
she
goes
her
way
and
now
i
will
go
mine
and
leave
her
he
nodded
in
london
with
all
the
things
she
cares
for
except
yourself
i
only
a
means
she
turned
her
quiet
face
to
him
you
know
she
said
that
no
she
repeated
to
his
silent
contradiction
i
watched
her
she
went
on
you
a
means
i
have
spoken
long
ago
if
i
had
thought
that
have
i
watched
have
i
lain
awake
through
long
nights
thinking
about
her
and
you
thinking
over
every
casual
mood
every
little
sign
longing
to
help
helpless
she
struggled
with
herself
for
she
was
weeping
has
come
to
she
said
in
a
whisper
and
choked
back
a
flood
of
tears
trafford
stood
motionless
watching
her
she
became
active
she
moved
round
the
table
she
looked
at
the
kettle
moved
the
cups
needlessly
made
tea
and
stood
waiting
for
a
moment
before
she
poured
it
out
so
hard
to
talk
to
you
she
said
and
about
all
this
i
care
so
much
for
her
and
for
you
words
do
come
dear
one
says
stupid
things
she
poured
out
the
tea
and
left
the
cups
steaming
and
came
and
stood
before
him
you
see
she
said
you
you
are
just
you
come
to
an
end
you
do
know
where
you
are
and
what
you
want
to
do
neither
does
she
my
dear
she
as
aimless
as
you
and
less
able
to
help
it
ever
so
much
less
able
but
she
does
show
it
she
goes
on
she
wants
things
and
wants
things
and
you
want
to
go
away
it
the
same
thing
it
exactly
the
same
thing
it
dissatisfaction
life
leaves
you
empty
and
craving
leaves
you
with
nothing
to
do
but
little
immediate
things
that
turn
to
dust
as
you
do
them
it
her
trouble
just
as
it
your
trouble
but
she
does
show
it
women
do
not
so
much
perhaps
even
she
does
know
it
half
the
women
in
our
world
do
know
and
for
a
woman
it
so
much
easier
to
go
on
so
many
little
trafford
tried
to
grasp
the
intention
of
this
mother
he
said
i
mean
to
go
away
but
think
of
her
i
thought
now
i
got
to
think
of
myself
you
ca
without
her
i
will
it
what
i
resolved
to
do
go
right
away
right
away
and
think
he
nodded
find
out
what
it
all
means
my
boy
yes
so
far
as
i
concerned
and
then
come
back
i
suppose
i
have
thought
to
her
he
did
answer
she
went
and
stood
beside
him
leaning
upon
the
mantel
godwin
she
said
she
only
be
further
behind
you
got
to
take
her
with
you
he
stood
still
and
silent
you
got
to
think
things
out
with
her
if
you
do
i
ca
then
you
ought
to
go
away
with
her
she
stopped
for
good
he
asked
yes
they
were
both
silent
for
a
space
then
trafford
gave
her
mind
to
the
tea
that
was
cooling
in
the
cups
and
added
milk
and
sugar
she
spoke
again
with
the
table
between
them
i
thought
so
much
of
these
things
she
said
with
the
in
her
hand
it
not
only
you
two
but
others
and
all
the
movement
about
us
marriage
is
what
it
was
it
become
a
different
thing
because
women
have
become
human
beings
only
you
know
godwin
all
these
things
are
so
difficult
to
express
woman
come
out
of
being
a
slave
and
yet
she
is
an
equal
we
had
a
sort
of
sham
emancipation
and
we
have
yet
come
to
the
real
one
she
put
down
the
on
the
tray
with
an
air
of
grave
deliberation
if
you
go
away
from
her
and
make
the
most
wonderful
discoveries
about
life
and
yourself
it
no
good
unless
she
makes
them
too
it
no
good
at
all
you
ca
live
without
her
in
the
end
any
more
than
she
can
live
without
you
you
may
think
you
can
but
i
watched
you
you
want
to
go
away
from
her
you
want
to
go
away
from
the
world
that
got
hold
of
her
from
the
dresses
and
parties
and
the
competition
and
all
this
complicated
flatness
we
have
to
live
in
it
would
worry
you
a
bit
if
it
had
got
hold
of
her
you
do
want
to
get
out
of
it
for
your
own
sake
you
out
of
it
you
are
as
much
out
of
it
as
any
one
can
be
only
she
holds
you
in
it
because
she
is
out
of
it
your
going
away
will
do
nothing
she
still
be
in
it
and
still
have
her
hold
on
you
you
got
to
take
her
away
or
else
if
you
go
away
in
the
end
it
will
be
just
like
a
ship
godwin
coming
back
to
its
moorings
she
watched
his
thoughtful
face
for
some
moments
then
arrested
herself
just
in
time
in
the
act
of
putting
a
second
portion
of
sugar
into
each
of
the
cups
she
handed
her
son
his
tea
and
he
took
it
mechanically
you
a
wise
little
mother
he
said
i
did
see
things
in
that
light
i
wonder
if
you
right
i
know
i
am
she
said
i
thought
more
and
more
it
was
marjorie
it
the
world
women
made
the
world
all
the
dress
and
display
and
competition
trafford
thought
sex
made
the
world
neither
men
nor
women
but
the
world
has
got
hold
of
the
women
tighter
than
it
has
the
men
deeper
in
she
looked
up
into
his
face
take
her
with
you
she
said
simply
she
wo
come
said
trafford
after
considering
it
trafford
reflected
she
come
if
you
make
her
she
said
she
want
to
bring
two
housemaids
i
do
think
you
know
marjorie
as
well
as
i
do
but
she
ca
she
can
it
you
you
want
to
take
two
housemaids
for
her
even
you
men
are
not
fair
to
women
trafford
put
his
untasted
tea
upon
the
mantelshelf
and
confronted
his
mother
with
a
question
point
blank
does
marjorie
care
for
me
he
asked
you
the
sun
of
her
world
but
she
goes
her
way
she
clever
she
full
of
life
full
of
activities
eager
to
make
and
arrange
and
order
but
there
nothing
she
is
nothing
she
makes
that
does
centre
on
you
but
if
she
cared
she
understand
my
dear
do
understand
he
stood
musing
i
had
everything
clear
he
said
i
saw
my
way
to
labrador
her
little
clock
pinged
the
hour
good
god
he
said
i
to
be
at
dinner
somewhere
at
seven
we
going
to
a
first
night
with
the
bernards
i
think
then
i
suppose
we
have
a
supper
always
life
is
being
slashed
to
tatters
by
these
things
always
one
thinks
in
snatches
of
fifty
minutes
it
dementia
they
dined
at
the
loretto
restaurant
with
the
bernards
and
richard
hampden
and
godwin
capes
the
wife
of
the
dramatist
a
woman
of
impulsive
speech
and
long
silences
who
had
subsided
from
an
early
romance
capes
had
been
divorced
for
her
while
she
was
still
a
mere
girl
into
a
markedly
correct
and
exclusive
mother
of
daughters
through
the
dinner
marjorie
was
watching
trafford
and
noting
the
deep
preoccupation
of
his
manner
he
talked
a
little
to
bernard
until
it
was
time
for
hampden
to
entertain
her
then
finding
capes
was
interested
in
bernard
he
lapsed
into
thought
presently
marjorie
discovered
his
eyes
scrutinizing
herself
she
hoped
the
play
would
catch
his
mind
but
the
play
seemed
devised
to
intensify
his
sense
of
the
tawdry
unreality
of
contemporary
life
bernard
filled
the
intervals
with
a
conventional
enthusiasm
capes
did
appear
he
does
seem
to
care
to
see
his
things
his
wife
explained
it
so
brilliant
said
bernard
he
has
to
do
it
said
capes
slowly
her
sombre
eyes
estimating
the
crowded
stalls
below
it
is
what
he
cares
to
do
the
play
was
in
fact
an
admirable
piece
of
english
stagecraft
and
it
dealt
exclusively
with
that
unreal
other
world
of
beings
the
english
theatre
has
for
its
own
purposes
developed
just
as
greece
through
the
ages
evolved
and
polished
and
perfected
the
idealized
life
of
its
homeric
poems
so
the
british
mind
has
evolved
their
stage
land
to
embody
its
more
honourable
dreams
full
of
heroic
virtues
incredible
honour
genial
worldliness
childish
villainies
profound
but
amiable
waiters
and
domestics
pathetic
shepherds
and
preposterous
crimes
capes
needing
an
income
had
mastered
the
habits
and
customs
of
this
imagined
world
as
one
learns
a
language
success
endorsed
his
mastery
he
knew
exactly
how
deeply
to
underline
an
irony
and
just
when
it
is
fit
and
proper
for
a
good
man
to
call
upon
god
or
cry
out
damn
in
this
play
he
had
invented
a
situation
in
which
a
charming
and
sympathetic
lady
had
killed
a
gross
and
drunken
husband
in
almost
but
not
quite
accidentally
and
had
then
appealed
to
the
prodigious
hero
for
assistance
in
the
resulting
complications
at
a
great
cost
of
mental
suffering
to
himself
he
had
told
his
first
and
only
lie
to
shield
her
then
years
after
he
had
returned
to
england
the
first
act
happened
of
course
in
india
to
find
her
on
the
eve
of
marrying
without
any
of
the
preliminary
confidences
common
among
human
beings
an
old
school
friend
of
his
in
plays
all
gentlemen
have
been
at
school
together
and
one
has
been
the
other
fag
the
audience
had
to
be
interested
in
the
problem
of
what
the
prodigious
hero
was
to
do
in
this
prodigious
situation
should
he
maintain
a
colossal
silence
continue
his
shielding
and
let
his
friend
marry
the
murderess
saved
by
his
perjury
or
the
dreadful
quandary
indeed
the
absolute
inconvenience
marjorie
watched
trafford
in
the
corner
of
the
box
as
he
listened
rather
contemptuously
to
the
statement
of
the
evening
problem
and
then
lapsed
again
into
a
brooding
quiet
she
wished
she
understood
his
moods
better
she
felt
there
was
more
in
this
than
a
mere
resentment
at
her
persistence
about
the
new
house
why
did
he
go
on
with
things
this
darkling
mood
of
his
had
only
become
manifest
to
her
during
the
last
three
or
four
years
of
their
life
previously
of
course
he
had
been
irritable
at
times
were
they
less
happy
now
than
they
had
been
in
the
little
house
in
chelsea
it
had
really
been
a
horrible
little
house
and
yet
there
had
been
a
brightness
then
a
nearness
she
found
her
mind
wandering
away
upon
a
sort
of
expedition
how
much
of
real
happiness
had
she
and
trafford
had
together
they
ought
by
every
standard
to
be
so
happy
she
declined
the
bernard
invitation
to
a
supper
and
began
to
talk
so
soon
as
she
and
trafford
had
settled
into
the
car
rag
she
said
something
the
matter
well
yes
the
house
yes
the
house
marjorie
considered
through
a
little
interval
old
man
why
are
you
so
prejudiced
against
a
bigger
house
oh
because
the
one
we
have
bores
me
and
the
next
one
will
bore
me
more
but
try
it
i
do
want
to
well
she
said
and
lapsed
into
silence
and
then
he
asked
what
are
we
going
to
do
going
to
do
when
after
the
new
house
i
going
to
open
out
she
said
he
made
no
answer
i
want
to
open
out
i
want
you
to
take
your
place
in
the
world
the
place
you
deserve
a
place
oh
the
house
is
only
a
means
he
thought
upon
that
a
means
he
asked
to
what
look
here
marjorie
what
do
you
think
you
are
up
to
with
me
and
yourself
what
do
you
see
me
doing
in
the
years
ahead
she
gave
him
a
silent
and
thoughtful
profile
for
a
second
or
so
at
first
i
suppose
you
are
going
on
with
your
researches
well
then
i
must
tell
you
what
i
think
of
you
rag
politics
good
lord
you
a
sort
of
power
you
could
make
things
noble
and
then
office
why
not
look
at
the
little
men
they
are
and
then
perhaps
a
still
bigger
house
you
not
fair
to
me
he
pulled
up
the
bearskin
over
his
knees
marjorie
he
said
you
see
we
are
going
to
do
any
of
those
things
at
all
i
ca
go
on
with
my
researches
he
explained
that
what
you
understand
i
not
able
to
get
back
to
work
i
shall
never
do
any
good
research
again
that
the
real
trouble
marjorie
and
it
makes
all
the
difference
as
for
politics
i
ca
touch
politics
i
despise
politics
i
think
this
empire
and
the
monarchy
and
lords
and
commons
and
patriotism
and
social
reform
and
all
the
rest
of
it
silly
beyond
words
temporary
accidental
foolish
a
mere
like
a
gipsey
roundabout
in
a
place
where
one
will
presently
build
a
house
you
do
help
make
the
house
by
riding
on
the
roundabout
there
no
clear
knowledge
no
clear
purpose
only
research
matters
and
expression
perhaps
i
suppose
expression
is
a
sort
of
research
until
we
get
that
that
sufficient
knowledge
and
you
see
i
ca
take
up
my
work
again
i
lost
something
she
waited
i
got
into
this
stupid
struggle
for
winning
money
he
went
on
and
i
feel
like
a
woman
must
feel
who
made
a
success
of
prostitution
been
prostituted
i
feel
like
some
one
fallen
and
diseased
business
and
prostitution
they
the
same
thing
all
business
is
a
sort
of
prostitution
all
prostitution
is
a
sort
of
business
why
should
one
sell
one
brains
any
more
than
one
sells
one
body
it
so
easy
to
succeed
if
one
has
good
brains
and
cares
to
do
it
and
does
let
attention
or
imagination
wander
and
it
so
degrading
hopelessly
degrading
i
sick
of
this
life
marjorie
do
want
to
buy
things
i
sick
of
buying
i
at
an
end
i
clean
at
an
end
exactly
as
though
suddenly
in
walking
through
a
great
house
one
came
on
a
passage
that
ended
abruptly
in
a
door
which
opened
on
nothing
nothing
this
is
a
mood
she
whispered
to
his
pause
it
is
a
mood
it
a
fact
i
got
nothing
ahead
and
i
know
how
to
get
back
my
life
no
good
to
me
any
more
i
spent
myself
she
looked
at
him
with
dismayed
eyes
but
she
said
this
a
mood
no
he
said
no
mood
but
conviction
i
he
started
the
car
had
stopped
at
their
house
and
malcolm
was
opening
the
door
of
the
car
they
descended
silently
and
went
upstairs
in
silence
he
came
into
her
room
presently
and
sat
down
by
her
fireside
she
had
gone
to
her
and
unfastened
a
necklace
now
with
this
winking
and
glittering
in
her
hand
she
came
and
stood
beside
him
rag
she
said
i
do
know
what
to
say
this
is
so
much
of
a
surprise
i
that
somehow
life
was
disappointing
you
that
i
was
disappointing
you
i
felt
it
endless
times
but
more
so
lately
i
have
perhaps
dared
to
let
myself
know
just
how
much
but
is
it
what
life
is
does
every
wife
disappoint
her
husband
we
none
of
us
inexhaustible
after
all
we
had
a
good
time
is
it
a
little
ungrateful
to
forget
look
here
rag
she
said
i
do
know
what
to
do
if
i
did
know
i
would
do
it
what
are
we
to
do
think
he
suggested
we
got
to
live
as
well
as
think
it
the
immense
troublesome
futility
of
everything
he
said
well
let
us
cease
to
be
futile
let
us
you
say
there
is
no
grip
for
you
in
research
that
you
despise
politics
there
no
end
of
trouble
and
suffering
can
not
we
do
social
work
social
reform
change
the
lives
of
others
less
fortunate
than
ourselves
who
are
we
that
we
should
tamper
with
the
lives
of
others
but
one
must
do
something
he
thought
that
over
no
he
said
that
the
universal
blunder
nowadays
one
must
do
the
right
thing
and
we
do
know
the
right
thing
marjorie
that
the
very
heart
of
the
trouble
does
this
life
satisfy
if
it
did
would
you
always
be
so
restless
but
she
said
think
of
the
good
things
in
life
it
just
the
good
the
exquisite
things
in
life
that
make
me
rebel
against
this
life
we
are
leading
it
because
i
seen
the
streaks
of
gold
that
i
know
the
rest
for
dirt
when
i
go
cheating
and
scheming
to
my
office
and
come
back
to
find
you
squandering
yourself
upon
a
horde
of
chattering
overdressed
women
when
i
think
that
that
is
our
substance
and
everyday
and
what
we
are
then
it
is
i
remember
most
the
deep
and
beautiful
things
it
is
impossible
dear
it
is
intolerable
that
life
was
made
beautiful
for
us
just
for
these
vulgarities
is
there
she
hesitated
love
still
but
has
it
been
love
love
is
a
thing
that
grows
but
we
took
it
as
people
take
flowers
out
of
a
garden
cut
them
off
put
them
in
water
how
much
of
our
daily
life
has
been
love
how
much
of
it
mere
consequences
of
the
love
we
left
behind
us
we
just
cohabited
and
love
you
and
i
and
thought
of
a
thousand
other
things
he
looked
up
at
her
oh
i
love
a
thousand
things
about
you
he
said
but
do
i
love
marjorie
have
i
got
you
have
i
lost
you
have
we
both
lost
something
the
very
heart
of
it
all
do
you
think
that
we
were
just
cheated
by
instinct
that
there
was
something
in
it
we
felt
and
thought
was
there
and
where
is
it
now
where
is
that
brightness
and
wonder
marjorie
and
the
pride
and
the
immense
unlimited
hope
she
was
still
for
a
moment
then
knelt
very
swiftly
before
him
and
held
out
her
arms
oh
rag
she
said
with
a
face
of
tender
beauty
he
took
her
finger
tips
in
his
dropped
them
and
stood
up
above
her
my
dear
he
cried
my
dear
why
do
you
always
want
to
turn
love
into
touches
stand
up
again
stand
up
there
my
dear
do
think
i
ceased
to
love
you
but
stand
up
there
and
let
me
talk
to
you
as
one
man
to
another
if
we
let
this
occasion
slide
to
embraces
he
stopped
short
she
crouched
before
the
fire
at
his
feet
go
on
she
said
go
on
i
feel
now
that
all
our
lives
now
marjorie
we
have
come
to
a
crisis
i
feel
that
now
is
the
time
either
we
shall
save
ourselves
now
or
we
shall
never
save
ourselves
it
is
as
if
something
had
gathered
and
accumulated
and
could
wait
no
longer
if
we
do
not
seize
this
opportunity
then
our
lives
will
go
on
as
they
have
gone
on
will
become
more
and
more
a
matter
of
small
excitements
and
elaborate
comforts
and
distraction
he
stopped
this
halting
speech
and
then
broke
out
again
oh
why
the
life
of
every
day
conquer
us
why
should
generation
after
generation
of
men
have
these
fine
beginnings
these
splendid
dreams
of
youth
attempt
so
much
achieve
so
much
and
then
then
become
look
at
this
room
this
litter
of
little
satisfactions
look
at
your
pretty
books
there
a
hundred
minds
you
have
pecked
at
bright
things
of
the
spirit
that
attracted
you
as
jewels
attract
a
jackdaw
look
at
the
glass
and
silver
and
that
silk
from
china
and
we
are
in
the
full
tide
of
our
years
marjorie
now
is
the
very
crown
and
best
of
our
lives
and
this
is
what
we
do
we
sample
we
accumulate
for
this
we
loved
for
this
we
hoped
do
you
remember
when
we
were
young
that
life
seemed
so
splendid
it
was
intolerable
we
should
ever
die
the
splendid
dream
the
intimations
of
greatness
the
miserable
failure
he
raised
clenched
fists
i
wo
stand
it
marjorie
i
wo
endure
it
somehow
in
some
way
i
will
get
out
of
this
life
and
you
with
me
i
have
been
brooding
upon
this
and
brooding
but
now
i
know
but
how
asked
marjorie
with
her
bare
arms
about
her
knees
staring
into
the
fire
we
must
get
out
of
its
constant
interruptions
its
incessant
vivid
petty
appeals
we
might
go
away
to
switzerland
we
to
switzerland
did
we
agree
it
was
our
second
honeymoon
it
is
a
honeymoon
we
need
no
we
have
to
go
further
than
that
a
sudden
light
broke
upon
marjorie
mind
she
realized
he
had
a
plan
she
lifted
a
face
to
him
and
looked
at
him
with
steady
eyes
and
asked
where
ever
so
much
further
where
i
do
know
you
do
you
planned
something
i
do
know
marjorie
at
least
i
have
made
up
my
mind
where
it
is
very
lonely
cold
and
remote
away
from
all
this
his
mind
stopped
short
and
he
ended
with
a
cry
oh
god
how
i
want
to
get
out
of
all
this
he
sat
down
in
her
and
bowed
his
face
on
his
hands
then
abruptly
he
stood
up
and
went
out
of
the
room
when
in
five
minutes
time
he
came
back
into
her
room
she
was
still
upon
her
hearthrug
before
the
fire
with
her
necklace
in
her
hand
the
red
reflections
of
the
flames
glowing
and
winking
in
her
jewels
and
in
her
eyes
he
came
and
sat
again
in
her
chair
i
have
been
ranting
he
said
i
feel
i
been
eloquent
you
make
me
feel
like
an
in
a
play
by
capes
you
are
the
most
difficult
person
for
me
to
talk
to
in
all
the
world
because
you
mean
so
much
to
me
she
moved
impulsively
and
checked
herself
and
crouched
away
from
him
i
must
touch
your
hand
she
whispered
i
want
to
explain
you
got
to
explain
i
got
quite
a
definite
plan
but
a
sort
of
terror
seized
me
it
was
like
shyness
i
know
i
knew
you
had
a
plan
you
see
i
mean
to
go
to
labrador
he
leant
forward
with
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
his
hands
extended
explanatory
he
wanted
intensely
that
she
should
understand
and
agree
and
his
desire
made
him
clumsy
now
slow
and
awkward
now
glibly
and
unsatisfyingly
eloquent
but
she
comprehended
his
quality
better
than
he
knew
they
were
to
go
away
to
labrador
this
snowy
desert
of
which
she
had
scarcely
heard
to
camp
in
the
very
heart
of
the
wilderness
two
hundred
miles
or
more
from
any
human
habitation
but
how
long
she
asked
abruptly
the
better
part
of
a
year
and
we
are
to
talk
yes
he
said
talk
and
think
ourselves
together
oh
the
old
phrases
carry
it
all
find
god
it
is
what
i
dreamt
of
rag
years
ago
will
you
come
he
cried
out
of
all
this
she
leant
across
the
hearthrug
and
seized
and
kissed
his
hand
then
with
one
of
those
swift
changes
of
hers
she
was
in
revolt
but
rag
she
exclaimed
this
is
dreaming
we
are
not
free
there
are
the
children
rag
we
can
not
leave
the
children
we
can
he
said
we
must
but
my
dear
our
duty
it
a
mother
duty
always
to
keep
with
her
children
they
will
be
looked
after
their
lives
are
organized
there
is
my
mother
close
at
hand
what
is
the
good
of
having
children
at
all
unless
their
world
is
to
be
better
than
our
world
what
are
we
doing
to
save
them
from
the
same
bathos
as
this
to
which
we
have
come
we
give
them
food
and
health
and
pictures
and
lessons
that
all
very
well
while
they
are
just
little
children
but
we
got
no
religion
to
give
them
no
aim
no
sense
of
a
general
purpose
what
is
the
good
of
bread
and
health
and
no
worship
what
can
we
say
to
them
when
they
ask
us
why
we
brought
them
into
the
world
happened
happened
what
are
we
to
tell
them
when
they
demand
the
purpose
of
all
this
training
all
these
lessons
when
they
ask
what
we
are
preparing
them
for
just
that
too
may
have
children
is
that
any
answer
marjorie
it
to
try
this
over
to
make
this
last
supreme
effort
just
as
it
will
be
to
separate
if
we
ca
get
the
puzzle
solved
together
separate
separate
why
not
we
can
afford
it
of
course
we
shall
separate
but
rag
separate
he
faced
her
protest
squarely
life
is
not
worth
living
he
said
unless
it
has
more
to
hold
it
together
than
ours
has
now
if
we
can
not
escape
together
then
will
go
they
parted
that
night
resolved
to
go
to
labrador
together
with
the
broad
outline
of
their
subsequent
journey
already
drawn
each
lay
awake
far
into
the
small
hours
thinking
of
this
purpose
and
of
one
another
with
a
strange
sense
of
renewed
association
each
woke
to
a
morning
of
sunshine
each
found
that
overnight
decision
remote
and
incredible
it
was
like
something
in
a
book
or
a
play
that
had
moved
them
very
deeply
they
came
down
to
breakfast
and
helped
themselves
after
the
wonted
fashion
of
several
years
marjorie
with
a
skilful
eye
to
the
large
order
of
her
household
the
had
one
or
two
characteristic
letters
which
interested
them
both
there
was
the
usual
picturesque
irruption
of
the
children
and
a
distribution
of
early
strawberries
among
them
trafford
had
two
notes
in
his
correspondence
which
threw
a
new
light
upon
the
reconstruction
of
the
company
in
which
he
was
interested
he
formed
a
definite
conclusion
upon
the
situation
and
went
quite
normally
to
his
study
and
the
telephone
to
act
upon
that
it
was
only
as
the
morning
wore
on
that
it
became
real
to
him
that
he
and
marjorie
had
decided
to
leave
the
world
then
with
the
business
settled
he
sat
at
his
desk
and
mused
his
apathy
passed
his
imagination
began
to
present
first
one
picture
and
then
another
of
his
retreat
he
walked
along
oxford
street
to
his
club
thinking
soon
we
shall
be
out
of
all
this
by
the
time
he
was
at
lunch
in
his
club
labrador
had
become
again
the
magic
refuge
it
had
seemed
the
day
before
after
lunch
he
went
to
work
in
the
library
finding
out
books
about
labrador
and
looking
up
the
details
of
the
journey
but
his
sense
of
futility
and
hopeless
oppression
had
vanished
he
walked
along
the
corridor
and
down
the
great
staircase
and
without
a
trace
of
the
despairful
hostility
of
the
previous
day
passed
blenkins
talking
grey
bosh
with
infinite
thoughtfulness
he
nodded
easily
to
blenkins
he
was
going
out
of
it
all
as
a
man
might
do
who
discovers
after
years
of
weary
incarceration
that
the
walls
of
his
cell
are
made
of
thin
paper
the
time
when
blenkins
seemed
part
of
a
of
routine
and
invincible
stupidity
seemed
ten
ages
ago
in
pall
mall
trafford
remarked
lady
grampians
and
the
countess
of
claridge
two
women
of
great
influence
in
a
big
green
car
on
the
way
no
doubt
to
create
or
sustain
or
destroy
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
it
was
limitless
ages
since
these
poor
old
dears
with
their
ridiculous
hats
and
their
ridiculous
airs
their
luncheons
and
dinners
and
dirty
aggressive
old
minds
had
sent
tidal
waves
of
competitive
anxiety
into
his
home
he
found
himself
jostling
through
the
shopping
crowd
on
the
sunny
side
of
regent
street
he
felt
now
that
he
looked
over
the
swarming
preoccupied
heads
at
distant
things
he
and
marjorie
were
going
out
of
it
all
going
clean
out
of
it
all
they
were
going
to
escape
from
society
and
shopping
and
petty
engagements
and
incessant
triviality
as
a
bird
flies
up
out
of
weeds
but
marjorie
fluctuated
more
than
he
did
there
were
times
when
the
expedition
for
which
he
was
now
preparing
rapidly
and
methodically
seemed
to
her
the
most
thing
that
had
ever
come
to
her
and
times
when
it
seemed
the
maddest
and
most
hopeless
of
eccentricities
there
were
times
when
she
had
devastating
premonitions
of
filth
hunger
strain
and
fatigue
damp
and
cold
when
her
whole
being
recoiled
from
the
project
when
she
could
even
think
of
staying
secure
in
london
and
letting
him
go
alone
she
developed
complicated
anxieties
for
the
children
she
found
reasons
for
further
inquiries
for
delay
why
not
she
suggested
wait
a
year
no
he
said
i
wo
i
mean
we
are
to
do
this
and
do
it
now
and
nothing
but
sheer
physical
inability
to
do
it
will
prevent
my
carrying
it
out
and
you
of
course
you
are
to
come
i
ca
drag
you
shrieking
all
the
way
to
labrador
short
of
that
i
going
to
you
come
with
me
she
sat
and
looked
up
at
him
with
dark
lights
in
her
upturned
eyes
and
a
little
added
warmth
in
her
cheek
you
never
forced
my
will
like
this
before
she
said
in
a
low
voice
never
he
was
too
intent
upon
his
own
resolve
to
heed
her
tones
it
has
seemed
necessary
somehow
he
said
considering
her
statement
now
it
does
this
is
something
final
she
said
it
is
final
she
found
an
old
familiar
phrasing
running
through
her
head
as
she
sat
crouched
together
looking
up
at
his
rather
gaunt
very
intent
face
the
speech
of
another
woman
echoing
to
her
across
a
vast
space
of
years
whither
thou
goest
i
will
go
in
labrador
he
began
chapter
the
third
the
pilgrimage
to
lonely
hut
marjorie
was
surprised
to
find
how
easy
it
was
at
last
to
part
from
her
children
and
go
with
trafford
i
am
not
sorry
she
said
not
a
bit
sorry
but
i
am
fearfully
afraid
i
shall
dream
they
are
ill
apart
from
that
it
strange
how
you
grip
me
and
they
do
in
the
train
to
liverpool
she
watched
trafford
with
the
queer
feeling
which
comes
to
all
husbands
and
wives
at
times
that
that
other
partner
is
indeed
an
undiscovered
stranger
just
beginning
to
show
perplexing
traits
full
of
inconceivable
possibilities
for
some
reason
his
tearing
her
up
by
the
roots
in
this
fashion
had
fascinated
her
imagination
she
felt
a
strange
new
wonder
at
him
that
had
in
it
just
a
pleasant
faint
flavour
of
fear
always
before
she
had
felt
a
curious
aversion
and
contempt
for
those
servile
women
who
are
said
to
seek
a
master
to
want
to
be
mastered
to
be
eager
even
for
the
physical
subjugations
of
brute
force
now
she
could
at
least
understand
sympathize
even
with
them
not
only
trafford
surprised
her
but
herself
she
found
she
was
in
an
unwonted
perplexing
series
of
moods
all
her
feelings
struck
her
now
as
being
incorrect
as
well
as
unexpected
not
only
had
life
become
suddenly
full
of
novelty
but
she
was
making
novel
responses
she
felt
that
she
ought
to
be
resentful
and
tragically
sorry
for
her
home
and
children
she
felt
this
departure
ought
to
have
the
quality
of
an
immense
sacrifice
a
desperate
and
heroic
undertaking
for
trafford
sake
instead
she
could
detect
little
beyond
an
adventurous
exhilaration
when
presently
she
walked
the
deck
of
the
steamer
that
was
to
take
her
to
john
she
had
visited
her
cabin
seen
her
luggage
stowed
away
and
now
she
surveyed
the
mersey
and
its
shipping
with
a
renewed
freshness
of
mind
she
was
reminded
of
the
day
now
nearly
nine
years
ago
when
she
had
crossed
the
sea
for
the
first
time
to
italy
then
too
trafford
had
seemed
a
being
of
infinitely
wonderful
possibilities
what
were
the
children
doing
that
ought
to
have
been
her
preoccupation
she
did
know
she
did
care
trafford
came
and
stood
beside
her
pointed
out
this
and
that
upon
the
landing
stage
no
longer
heavily
sullen
but
alert
interested
almost
gay
neither
of
them
could
find
any
way
to
the
great
discussion
they
had
set
out
upon
in
this
voyage
to
john
but
there
was
plenty
of
time
before
them
plenty
of
time
they
were
both
the
prey
of
that
uneasy
distraction
which
seems
the
inevitable
quality
of
a
passenger
steamship
they
surveyed
and
criticized
their
fellow
travellers
and
prowled
up
and
down
through
the
long
swaying
days
and
the
cold
dark
nights
they
slept
uneasily
amidst
hootings
and
the
startling
sounds
of
waves
swirling
against
the
ports
marjorie
had
never
had
a
long
sea
voyage
before
for
the
first
time
in
her
life
she
saw
all
the
world
through
a
succession
of
days
as
a
circle
of
endless
blue
waters
with
the
stars
and
planets
and
sun
and
moon
rising
sharply
from
its
rim
until
one
has
had
a
voyage
no
one
really
understands
that
old
earth
is
a
watery
globe
they
ran
into
thirty
hours
of
storm
which
subsided
and
then
came
a
slow
time
among
icebergs
and
a
hooting
dreary
passage
through
fog
the
first
three
icebergs
were
marvels
the
rest
bores
a
passing
collier
out
of
her
course
and
pitching
heavily
a
lonely
black
and
dirty
ship
with
a
manner
almost
derelict
filled
their
thoughts
for
half
a
day
their
minds
were
in
a
state
of
tedious
inactivity
eager
for
such
small
interests
and
only
capable
of
such
small
interests
there
was
no
hurry
to
talk
they
agreed
no
hurry
at
all
until
they
were
settled
away
ahead
there
among
the
snows
there
we
shall
have
plenty
of
time
for
everything
came
the
landfall
and
then
john
and
they
found
themselves
side
by
side
watching
the
town
draw
near
the
thought
of
landing
and
transference
to
another
ship
refreshed
them
both
they
were
going
trafford
said
in
search
of
god
but
it
was
far
more
like
two
children
starting
out
upon
a
holiday
there
was
trouble
and
procrastination
about
the
guides
that
trafford
had
arranged
should
meet
them
at
john
and
it
was
three
weeks
from
their
reaching
newfoundland
before
they
got
themselves
and
their
guides
and
equipment
and
general
stores
aboard
the
boat
for
port
dupré
thence
he
had
planned
they
should
go
in
the
gibson
schooner
to
manivikovik
the
marconi
station
at
the
mouth
of
the
green
river
and
thence
past
the
new
up
river
to
the
wilderness
there
were
delays
and
a
few
trivial
troublesome
complications
in
carrying
out
this
scheme
but
at
last
a
day
came
when
trafford
could
wave
to
the
seven
people
and
eleven
dogs
which
constituted
the
population
of
peter
hammond
that
last
rude
outpost
of
civilization
twenty
miles
above
the
and
turn
his
face
in
good
earnest
towards
the
wilderness
neither
he
nor
marjorie
looked
back
at
the
headland
for
a
last
glimpse
of
the
little
settlement
they
were
leaving
each
stared
ahead
over
the
broad
smooth
sweep
of
water
broken
by
one
transverse
bar
of
foaming
shallows
and
scanned
the
low
hills
beyond
that
drew
together
at
last
in
the
distant
gorge
out
of
which
the
river
came
the
morning
was
warm
and
full
of
the
promise
of
a
hot
noon
so
that
the
veils
they
wore
against
the
assaults
of
and
mosquitoes
were
already
a
little
inconvenient
it
seemed
incredible
in
this
morning
glow
that
the
wooded
slopes
along
the
shore
of
the
lake
were
the
border
of
a
land
in
which
nearly
half
the
inhabitants
die
of
starvation
the
canoes
swept
almost
noiselessly
through
the
water
with
a
rhythmic
alternation
of
rush
and
pause
as
the
dripping
paddles
drove
and
returned
altogether
there
were
four
long
canoes
and
five
indian
breeds
in
their
party
and
when
they
came
to
pass
through
shallows
both
marjorie
and
trafford
took
a
paddle
they
came
to
the
throat
of
the
gorge
towards
noon
and
found
strong
flowing
deep
water
between
its
high
purple
cliffs
all
hands
had
to
paddle
again
and
it
was
only
when
they
came
to
rest
in
a
pool
to
eat
a
meal
and
afterwards
to
land
upon
a
mossy
corner
for
a
stretch
and
a
smoke
that
marjorie
discovered
the
peculiar
beauty
of
the
rock
about
them
on
the
dull
surfaces
played
the
most
extraordinary
mist
of
luminous
iridescence
it
fascinated
her
here
was
a
land
whose
common
substance
had
this
gemlike
opalescence
but
her
attention
was
very
soon
withdrawn
from
these
glancing
splendours
she
had
had
to
put
aside
her
veil
to
eat
and
presently
she
felt
the
vividly
painful
stabs
of
the
and
discovered
blood
upon
her
face
a
bigger
fly
the
size
and
something
of
the
appearance
of
a
small
wasp
with
an
evil
buzz
also
assailed
her
and
trafford
it
was
a
bad
corner
for
flies
the
breeds
even
were
slapping
their
wrists
and
swearing
under
the
torment
and
every
one
was
glad
to
embark
and
push
on
up
the
winding
gorge
it
opened
out
for
a
time
and
then
the
wooded
shores
crept
in
again
and
in
another
they
saw
ahead
of
them
a
long
rush
of
foaming
waters
among
tumbled
rocks
that
poured
down
from
a
brimming
splashing
line
of
light
against
the
sky
they
crossed
the
river
ran
the
canoes
into
an
eddy
under
the
shelter
of
a
big
stone
and
began
to
unload
they
had
reached
their
first
portage
the
rest
of
the
first
day
was
spent
in
packing
and
lugging
first
the
cargoes
and
then
the
canoes
up
through
thickets
and
over
boulders
and
across
stretches
of
reindeer
moss
for
the
better
part
of
two
miles
to
a
camping
ground
about
up
the
rapids
marjorie
and
trafford
tried
to
help
with
the
carrying
but
this
evidently
shocked
and
distressed
the
men
too
much
so
they
desisted
and
set
to
work
cutting
wood
and
gathering
moss
for
the
fires
and
bedding
for
the
camp
when
the
iron
stove
was
brought
up
the
man
who
had
carried
it
showed
them
how
to
put
it
up
on
stakes
and
start
a
fire
in
it
and
then
trafford
went
to
the
river
to
get
water
and
marjorie
made
a
kind
of
flour
cake
in
the
in
the
manner
an
american
woman
from
the
wilderness
had
once
shown
her
and
boiled
water
for
tea
the
twilight
had
deepened
to
night
while
the
men
were
still
stumbling
up
the
trail
with
the
last
two
canoes
it
gave
marjorie
a
curiously
homeless
feeling
to
stand
there
in
the
open
with
the
sunset
dying
away
below
the
black
scrubby
outlines
of
the
treetops
uphill
to
the
northwest
and
to
realize
the
nearest
roof
was
already
a
day
toilsome
journey
away
the
cool
night
breeze
blew
upon
her
bare
face
and
arms
for
now
the
insects
had
ceased
from
troubling
and
she
had
cast
aside
gloves
and
veil
and
turned
up
her
sleeves
to
cook
and
the
air
was
full
of
the
tumult
of
the
rapids
tearing
seaward
over
the
rocks
below
struggling
through
the
bushes
towards
her
was
an
immense
headless
quadruped
with
unsteady
legs
and
hesitating
paces
two
of
the
men
carrying
the
last
canoe
two
others
were
now
assisting
trafford
to
put
up
the
little
tent
that
was
to
shelter
her
and
the
fifth
was
kneeling
beside
her
very
solemnly
and
respectfully
cutting
slices
of
bacon
for
her
to
fry
the
air
was
very
sweet
and
she
wished
she
could
sleep
not
in
the
tent
but
under
the
open
sky
it
was
queer
she
thought
how
much
of
the
wrappings
of
civilization
had
slipped
from
them
already
every
day
of
the
journey
from
london
had
released
them
or
deprived
them
she
hardly
knew
which
of
a
multitude
of
petty
comforts
and
easy
accessibilities
the
afternoon
toil
uphill
intensified
the
effect
of
having
clambered
up
out
of
things
to
this
loneliness
this
twilight
openness
this
simplicity
the
men
ate
apart
at
a
fire
they
made
for
themselves
and
after
trafford
and
marjorie
had
supped
on
damper
bacon
and
tea
he
smoked
they
were
both
too
healthily
tired
to
talk
very
much
there
was
no
moon
but
a
frosty
brilliance
of
stars
the
air
which
had
been
hot
and
sultry
at
grew
keen
and
penetrating
and
after
she
had
made
him
tell
her
the
names
of
constellations
she
had
forgotten
she
suddenly
perceived
the
wisdom
of
the
tent
went
into
it
it
was
sweet
and
wonderful
with
sprigs
of
the
labrador
undressed
and
had
hardly
rolled
herself
up
into
a
cocoon
of
blankets
before
she
was
fast
asleep
she
was
awakened
by
a
blaze
of
sunshine
pouring
into
the
tent
a
smell
of
fried
bacon
and
trafford
voice
telling
her
to
get
up
they
gone
on
with
the
first
loads
he
said
get
up
wrap
yourself
in
a
blanket
and
come
and
bathe
in
the
river
it
as
cold
as
ice
she
blinked
at
him
are
you
stiff
she
asked
i
was
stiffer
before
i
bathed
he
said
she
took
the
tin
he
offered
her
they
were
to
see
china
cups
again
for
a
year
it
woman
work
getting
tea
she
said
as
she
drank
you
ca
be
a
squaw
all
at
once
said
trafford
after
marjorie
had
taken
her
dip
dried
roughly
behind
a
bush
twisted
her
hair
into
a
pigtail
and
coiled
it
under
her
hat
she
amused
herself
and
trafford
as
they
clambered
up
through
rocks
and
willows
to
the
tent
again
by
cataloguing
her
apparatus
of
bath
and
toilette
at
sussex
square
and
tracing
just
when
and
how
she
had
parted
from
each
item
on
the
way
to
this
place
but
i
she
cried
with
a
sudden
sharp
note
of
dismay
we
have
soap
this
is
our
last
cake
almost
i
never
thought
of
soap
nor
i
said
trafford
he
spoke
again
presently
we
do
turn
back
for
soap
he
said
we
do
turn
back
for
anything
said
marjorie
still
i
did
count
on
a
soapless
winter
i
manage
something
said
trafford
a
little
doubtfully
trust
a
chemist
that
day
they
finished
the
portage
and
came
out
upon
a
wide
lake
with
sloping
shores
and
a
distant
view
of
mountains
a
lake
so
shallow
that
at
times
their
loaded
canoes
scraped
on
the
glaciated
rock
below
and
they
had
to
alter
their
course
they
camped
in
a
lurid
sunset
the
night
was
warm
and
mosquitoes
were
troublesome
and
towards
morning
came
a
thunderstorm
and
wind
and
rain
the
dawn
broke
upon
a
tearing
race
of
waves
and
a
wild
drift
of
slanting
rain
sweeping
across
the
lake
before
a
gale
marjorie
peered
out
at
this
as
one
peers
out
under
the
edge
of
an
umbrella
it
was
manifestly
impossible
to
go
on
and
they
did
nothing
that
day
but
run
up
a
canvas
shelter
for
the
men
and
shift
the
tent
behind
a
thicket
of
trees
out
of
the
full
force
of
the
wind
the
men
squatted
stoically
and
smoked
and
yarned
everything
got
coldly
wet
and
for
the
most
part
the
traffords
sat
under
the
tent
and
stared
blankly
at
this
summer
day
in
labrador
now
said
trafford
we
ought
to
begin
talking
there
nothing
much
to
do
else
said
marjorie
only
one
ca
begin
said
trafford
he
was
silent
for
a
time
we
getting
out
of
things
he
said
the
next
day
began
with
a
fine
drizzle
through
which
the
sun
broke
suddenly
about
ten
they
made
a
start
at
once
and
got
a
good
dozen
miles
up
the
lake
before
it
was
necessary
to
camp
again
both
marjorie
and
trafford
felt
stiff
and
weary
and
uncomfortable
all
day
and
secretly
a
little
doubtful
now
of
their
own
endurance
they
camped
on
an
island
on
turf
amidst
slippery
rocks
and
the
next
day
were
in
a
foaming
difficult
river
again
with
glittering
shallows
that
obliged
every
one
to
get
out
at
times
to
wade
and
push
all
through
the
afternoon
they
were
greatly
beset
by
flies
and
so
they
worked
their
way
on
through
a
third
days
journey
towards
the
silent
inland
of
labrador
day
followed
day
of
toilsome
and
often
tedious
travel
they
fought
rapids
they
waited
while
the
men
stumbled
up
long
portages
under
vast
loads
going
and
returning
they
camped
and
discussed
difficulties
and
alternatives
the
flies
sustained
an
unrelenting
persecution
until
faces
were
scarred
in
spite
of
veils
and
smoke
fires
until
wrists
and
necks
were
swollen
and
the
blood
in
a
fever
as
they
got
higher
and
higher
towards
the
central
plateau
the
heat
increased
and
the
nights
grew
colder
until
they
would
find
themselves
toiling
wet
with
perspiration
over
rocks
that
sheltered
a
fringe
of
ice
beneath
their
shadows
the
first
fatigues
and
lassitudes
the
shrinking
from
cold
water
the
ache
of
muscular
effort
gave
place
to
a
tougher
and
tougher
endurance
skin
seemed
to
have
lost
half
its
capacity
for
pain
without
losing
a
tithe
of
its
discrimination
muscles
attained
a
steely
resilience
they
were
getting
seasoned
i
do
feel
philosophical
said
trafford
but
i
feel
well
we
getting
out
of
things
suppose
we
are
getting
out
of
our
problems
one
day
as
they
paddled
across
a
pool
they
saw
three
bears
prowling
in
single
file
high
up
on
the
hillside
look
said
the
man
and
pointed
with
his
paddle
at
the
big
soft
furry
black
shapes
magnified
and
startling
in
the
clear
air
all
the
canoes
rippled
to
a
stop
the
men
at
first
still
whispered
softly
one
passed
a
gun
to
trafford
who
hesitated
and
looked
at
marjorie
the
air
of
tranquil
assurance
about
these
three
huge
loafing
monsters
had
a
queer
effect
on
marjorie
mind
they
made
her
feel
that
they
were
at
home
and
that
she
was
an
intruder
she
had
never
in
her
life
seen
any
big
wild
animals
except
in
a
menagerie
she
had
developed
a
sort
of
unconscious
belief
that
all
big
wild
animals
were
in
menageries
nowadays
and
this
spectacle
of
beasts
entirely
at
large
startled
her
there
was
never
a
bar
between
these
creatures
she
felt
and
her
sleeping
self
they
might
she
thought
do
any
desperate
thing
to
feeble
men
and
women
who
came
their
way
shall
i
take
a
shot
asked
trafford
no
said
marjorie
pervaded
by
the
desire
for
mutual
toleration
let
them
be
the
big
brutes
disappeared
in
a
gully
reappeared
came
out
against
the
skyline
one
by
one
and
vanished
too
long
a
shot
said
trafford
handing
back
the
gun
their
journey
lasted
altogether
a
month
never
once
did
they
come
upon
any
human
being
save
themselves
though
in
one
place
they
passed
the
poles
for
the
most
part
overthrown
of
an
old
indian
encampment
but
this
desolation
was
by
no
means
lifeless
they
saw
great
quantities
of
waterbirds
geese
divers
arctic
partridge
and
the
like
they
became
familiar
with
the
banshee
cry
of
the
loon
they
lived
very
largely
on
geese
and
partridge
then
for
a
time
about
a
string
of
lakes
the
country
was
alive
with
migrating
deer
going
south
and
the
men
found
traces
of
a
wolf
they
killed
six
caribou
and
stayed
to
skin
and
cut
them
up
and
dry
the
meat
to
replace
the
bacon
they
had
consumed
caught
fried
and
ate
great
quantities
of
trout
and
became
accustomed
to
the
mysterious
dance
of
the
northern
lights
as
the
sunset
afterglow
faded
everywhere
except
in
the
river
gorges
the
country
displayed
the
low
hummocky
lines
and
pools
of
intensely
glaciated
land
everywhere
it
was
carpeted
with
reindeer
moss
growing
upon
peat
and
variegated
by
bushes
of
flowering
labrador
tea
in
places
this
was
starred
with
little
harebells
and
diversified
by
tussocks
of
heather
and
rough
grass
and
over
the
rocks
trailed
delicate
dwarf
shrubs
and
a
very
pretty
and
fragrant
plant
of
which
neither
she
nor
trafford
knew
the
name
there
was
an
astonishing
amount
of
wild
fruit
raspberries
cranberries
and
a
white
kind
of
strawberry
that
was
very
delightful
the
weather
after
its
first
outbreak
remained
brightly
serene
and
at
last
it
seemed
fit
to
trafford
to
halt
and
choose
his
winter
quarters
he
chose
a
place
on
the
side
of
a
low
rocky
mountain
ridge
about
fifty
feet
above
the
river
which
had
now
dwindled
to
a
stream
his
site
was
near
a
tributary
rivulet
that
gave
convenient
water
in
a
kind
of
lap
that
sheltered
between
two
rocky
knees
each
bearing
thickets
of
willow
and
balsam
not
a
dozen
miles
away
from
them
now
they
reckoned
was
the
height
of
land
the
low
watershed
between
the
waters
that
go
to
the
atlantic
and
those
that
go
to
hudson
bay
close
beside
the
site
he
had
chosen
a
shelf
of
rock
ran
out
and
gave
a
glimpse
up
the
narrow
rocky
valley
of
the
green
upper
waters
and
a
broad
prospect
of
hill
and
tarn
towards
the
north
and
of
them
the
country
rose
to
a
line
of
low
crests
with
here
and
there
a
yellowing
patch
of
last
year
snow
and
across
the
valley
were
slopes
covered
in
places
by
woods
of
stunted
pine
it
had
an
empty
spaciousness
of
effect
the
one
continually
living
thing
seemed
to
be
the
green
river
hurrying
headlong
noisily
perpetually
in
an
eternal
flight
from
this
high
desolation
birds
were
rare
here
and
the
insects
that
buzzed
and
shrilled
and
tormented
among
the
rocks
and
willows
in
the
gorge
came
but
sparingly
up
the
slopes
to
them
here
presently
said
trafford
we
shall
be
in
peace
it
is
very
lonely
said
marjorie
the
nearer
to
god
think
not
one
of
these
hills
has
ever
had
a
name
well
it
might
be
in
some
other
planet
oh
we
christen
them
that
shall
be
marjorie
ridge
and
that
rag
valley
this
space
shall
be
oh
bayswater
before
we
done
with
it
this
place
and
every
feature
of
it
will
be
as
familiar
as
sussex
square
more
so
for
half
the
houses
there
would
be
stranger
to
us
if
we
could
see
inside
them
than
anything
in
this
wilderness
as
familiar
say
as
your
that
better
marjorie
made
no
answer
but
her
eyes
went
from
the
reindeer
moss
and
scrub
and
thickets
of
the
foreground
to
the
low
rocky
ridges
that
bounded
the
view
north
and
east
of
them
the
scattered
boulders
the
tangles
of
wood
the
barren
upper
slopes
the
survivals
of
the
winter
snowfall
all
contributed
to
an
effect
at
once
carelessly
desert
and
hopelessly
untidy
she
looked
westward
and
her
memory
was
full
of
interminable
streaming
rapids
wastes
of
rocks
tiresome
struggles
through
woods
and
wild
wide
stretches
of
tundra
and
tarn
trackless
and
treeless
infinitely
desolate
it
seemed
to
her
that
the
sea
coast
was
but
a
step
from
london
and
ten
thousand
miles
away
from
her
the
men
had
engaged
to
build
the
framework
of
hut
and
store
shed
before
returning
and
to
this
under
trafford
direction
they
now
set
themselves
they
were
all
mingling
with
indian
with
scottish
or
french
blood
sober
and
experienced
men
three
were
named
mackenzie
two
brothers
and
a
cousin
and
another
raymond
noyes
was
a
relation
and
acquaintance
of
that
george
elson
who
was
with
wallace
and
leonidas
hubbard
and
afterwards
guided
hubbard
in
her
crossing
of
labrador
the
fifth
was
a
boy
of
eighteen
named
lean
they
were
all
familiar
with
the
idea
of
summer
travel
in
this
country
quite
a
number
a
score
or
so
that
is
to
say
of
adventurous
people
including
three
or
four
women
had
ventured
far
in
the
wake
of
the
hubbards
into
these
great
wildernesses
during
the
decade
that
followed
that
first
tragic
experiment
in
which
hubbard
died
but
that
any
one
not
of
indian
or
esquimaux
blood
should
propose
to
face
out
the
labrador
winter
was
a
new
thing
to
them
they
were
really
very
sceptical
at
the
outset
whether
these
two
highly
people
would
ever
get
up
to
the
height
of
land
at
all
and
it
was
still
with
manifest
incredulity
that
they
set
about
the
building
of
the
hut
and
the
construction
of
the
sleeping
bunks
for
which
they
had
brought
up
planking
a
stream
of
speculative
talk
had
flowed
along
beside
marjorie
and
trafford
ever
since
they
had
entered
the
green
river
and
it
did
so
much
come
to
an
end
as
get
cut
off
at
last
by
the
necessity
of
their
departure
noyes
would
stand
holding
a
hammer
and
staring
at
the
narrow
little
berth
he
was
fixing
together
you
not
sleep
in
this
he
said
i
will
replied
marjorie
you
come
back
with
us
not
me
there
be
wolves
come
and
howl
let
they
come
right
up
to
the
door
here
winter
makes
hidjus
bold
marjorie
shrugged
her
shoulders
it
that
cold
i
known
a
man
have
his
nose
froze
while
he
lay
in
bed
said
noyes
up
here
down
the
coast
but
they
say
it
as
cold
up
here
many
the
man
it
starved
and
he
and
his
companions
told
stories
very
circumstantial
and
pitiful
stories
of
indian
disasters
they
were
all
tales
of
weariness
and
starvation
of
the
cessation
of
food
because
the
fishing
gave
out
because
the
caribou
did
not
migrate
by
the
customary
route
because
the
man
of
a
family
group
broke
his
wrist
and
then
of
the
start
of
all
or
some
of
the
party
to
the
coast
to
get
help
and
provisions
of
the
straining
starving
fugitives
caught
by
blizzards
losing
the
track
devouring
small
vermin
raw
gnawing
their
own
skin
garments
until
they
toiled
in
the
snow
becoming
cannibals
becoming
delirious
lying
down
to
die
once
there
was
an
epidemic
of
influenza
and
three
families
of
seven
and
twenty
people
just
gave
up
and
starved
and
died
in
their
lodges
and
were
found
still
partly
frozen
a
patient
pitiful
company
by
trappers
in
the
spring
such
they
said
were
the
common
things
that
happened
in
a
labrador
winter
did
the
traffords
wish
to
run
such
risks
a
sort
of
propagandist
enthusiasm
grew
up
in
the
men
they
felt
it
incumbent
upon
them
to
persuade
the
traffords
to
return
they
reasoned
with
them
rather
as
one
does
with
wilful
children
they
tried
to
remind
them
of
the
delights
and
securities
of
the
world
they
were
deserting
noyes
drew
fancy
pictures
of
the
pleasures
of
london
by
way
of
contrast
to
the
bitter
days
before
them
you
got
everything
there
everything
suppose
you
feel
a
bit
ill
you
go
out
and
every
block
there
a
drug
store
got
everything
all
the
new
twenty
thirty
sorts
of
lit
up
nice
and
chaps
in
collars
like
gentlemen
or
you
feel
a
bit
dully
and
you
go
into
the
streets
and
there
people
why
when
i
was
in
new
york
i
used
to
spend
hours
looking
at
the
people
hours
and
everything
lit
up
too
sky
signs
readin
everywhere
you
can
spend
hours
and
hours
in
new
york
london
said
marjorie
well
london
just
going
about
and
reading
the
things
they
stick
up
every
blamed
sort
of
thing
or
you
say
let
go
somewhere
let
go
out
and
be
a
bit
lively
see
up
you
get
on
a
car
and
there
you
are
great
big
restaurants
blazing
with
lights
and
you
ca
think
of
a
thing
to
eat
they
have
got
waiters
all
round
you
dressed
tremendous
fair
asking
you
to
have
more
or
you
say
let
go
to
a
theatre
very
likely
said
noyes
letting
his
imagination
soar
you
order
up
one
of
these
automobillies
by
telephone
helped
trafford
by
telephone
confirmed
noyes
when
i
was
in
new
york
there
was
a
telephone
in
each
room
in
the
hotel
each
room
i
did
use
it
ever
except
once
when
they
did
answer
but
there
it
was
i
know
about
telephones
all
right
why
had
they
come
here
none
of
the
men
were
clear
about
that
marjorie
and
trafford
would
overhear
them
discussing
this
question
at
their
fire
night
after
night
they
seemed
to
talk
of
nothing
else
they
indulged
in
the
boldest
hypotheses
even
in
the
theory
that
trafford
knew
of
deposits
of
diamonds
and
gold
and
would
trust
no
one
but
his
wife
with
the
secret
they
seemed
also
attracted
by
the
idea
that
our
two
young
people
had
done
something
lean
with
memories
of
some
tattered
sixpenny
novel
that
had
drifted
into
his
hands
from
england
had
even
some
notion
of
an
elopement
of
a
pursuing
husband
or
a
vindictive
wife
he
was
young
and
romantic
but
it
seemed
incredible
he
should
suggest
that
marjorie
was
a
royal
princess
yet
there
were
moments
when
his
manner
betrayed
a
more
than
personal
respect
one
night
after
a
hard
day
portage
mackenzie
was
inspired
by
a
brilliant
idea
they
got
no
children
he
said
in
a
hoarse
exceptionally
audible
whisper
it
worries
them
them
as
is
catholics
goes
pilgrimages
but
these
ai
catholics
see
i
ca
stand
that
said
marjorie
it
touches
my
pride
i
stood
a
good
deal
mr
mackenzie
mr
mackenzie
the
voice
at
the
men
fire
stopped
and
a
black
head
turned
around
what
is
it
mrs
trafford
asked
mackenzie
she
held
up
four
fingers
four
she
said
eh
three
sons
and
a
daughter
said
marjorie
mackenzie
did
not
take
it
in
until
his
younger
brother
had
repeated
her
words
and
you
come
from
them
to
sir
what
you
come
for
we
want
to
be
here
shouted
trafford
to
their
listening
pause
their
silence
was
incredulous
we
wanted
to
be
alone
together
there
was
too
much
over
there
too
much
everything
mackenzie
in
silhouette
against
the
fire
shook
his
head
entirely
dissatisfied
he
could
not
understand
how
there
could
be
too
much
of
anything
it
was
beyond
a
trapper
philosophy
come
back
with
us
sir
said
noyes
you
weary
of
it
noyes
clung
to
the
idea
of
dissuasion
to
the
end
i
do
care
to
leave
ye
he
said
and
made
a
sort
of
byword
of
it
that
served
when
there
was
nothing
else
to
say
he
made
it
almost
his
last
words
he
turned
back
for
another
handclasp
as
the
others
under
their
light
returning
packs
were
filing
down
the
hill
i
do
care
to
leave
ye
he
said
good
luck
said
trafford
you
need
it
said
noyes
and
looked
at
marjorie
very
gravely
and
intently
before
he
turned
about
and
marched
off
after
his
fellows
both
marjorie
and
trafford
felt
a
queer
emotion
a
sense
of
loss
and
desertion
a
swelling
in
the
throat
as
that
file
of
men
receded
over
the
rocky
slopes
went
down
into
a
dip
reappeared
presently
small
and
remote
cresting
another
spur
going
on
towards
the
little
wood
that
hid
the
head
of
the
rapids
they
halted
for
a
moment
on
the
edge
of
the
wood
and
looked
back
then
turned
again
one
by
one
and
melted
stride
by
stride
into
the
trees
noyes
was
the
last
to
go
he
stood
in
an
attitude
that
spoke
as
plainly
as
words
i
do
care
to
leave
ye
something
white
waved
and
flickered
he
had
whipped
out
the
letters
they
had
given
him
for
england
and
he
was
waving
them
then
as
if
by
an
effort
he
set
himself
to
follow
the
others
and
the
two
still
watchers
on
the
height
above
saw
him
no
more
chapter
the
fourth
lonely
hut
marjorie
and
trafford
walked
slowly
back
to
the
hut
there
is
much
to
do
before
the
weather
breaks
he
said
ending
a
thoughtful
silence
then
we
can
sit
inside
there
and
talk
about
the
things
we
need
to
talk
about
he
added
awkwardly
since
we
started
there
has
been
so
much
to
hold
the
attention
i
remember
a
mood
an
immense
despair
i
feel
it
still
somewhere
at
the
back
of
things
waiting
to
be
dealt
with
it
our
essential
fact
but
meanwhile
we
been
busy
looking
at
fresh
things
he
paused
now
it
will
be
different
perhaps
for
nearly
four
weeks
indeed
they
were
occupied
very
closely
and
crept
into
their
bunks
at
night
as
tired
as
wholesome
animals
who
drop
to
sleep
at
any
time
the
weather
might
break
already
there
had
been
two
overcast
days
and
a
frowning
conference
of
clouds
in
the
north
when
at
last
storms
began
they
knew
there
would
be
nothing
for
it
but
to
keep
in
the
hut
until
the
world
froze
up
there
was
much
to
do
to
the
hut
the
absence
of
anything
but
stunted
and
impoverished
timber
and
the
limitation
of
time
had
forbidden
a
log
hut
and
their
home
was
really
only
a
double
framework
rammed
tight
between
inner
and
outer
frame
with
a
mixture
of
earth
and
boughs
and
twigs
of
willow
pine
and
balsam
the
floor
was
hammered
earth
carpeted
with
balsam
twigs
and
a
caribou
skin
outside
and
within
wall
and
roof
were
faced
with
coarse
canvas
that
was
trafford
idea
and
their
bunks
occupied
two
sides
of
the
hut
heating
was
done
by
the
stove
they
had
brought
with
them
and
the
smoke
was
carried
out
to
the
roof
by
a
thin
pipe
which
had
come
up
outside
a
roll
of
canvas
they
had
made
the
roof
with
about
the
pitch
of
a
swiss
châlet
and
it
was
covered
with
nailed
waterproof
canvas
held
down
by
a
large
number
of
big
lumps
of
stone
much
of
the
canvassing
still
remained
to
do
when
the
men
went
down
and
then
the
traffords
used
every
scrap
of
and
newspaper
that
had
come
up
with
them
and
was
not
needed
for
lining
the
bunks
in
covering
any
crack
or
join
in
the
canvas
wall
two
decadent
luxuries
a
rubber
bath
and
two
rubber
bottles
hung
behind
the
door
they
were
almost
the
only
luxuries
kettles
and
pans
and
some
provisions
stood
on
a
shelf
over
the
stove
there
was
also
a
sort
of
recess
cupboard
in
the
opposite
corner
reserve
clothes
were
in
canvas
trunks
under
the
bunks
they
kept
their
immediate
supply
of
wood
under
the
eaves
just
outside
the
door
and
there
was
a
big
can
of
water
between
stove
and
door
when
the
winter
came
they
would
have
to
bring
in
ice
from
the
stream
this
was
their
home
the
tent
that
had
sheltered
marjorie
on
the
way
up
was
erected
close
to
this
hut
to
serve
as
a
rude
scullery
and
outhouse
and
they
also
made
a
long
roughly
thatched
roof
with
a
canvas
cover
supported
on
stakes
to
shelter
the
rest
of
the
stores
the
stuff
in
tins
and
cases
and
jars
they
left
on
the
ground
under
this
the
rest
the
flour
candles
bacon
dried
caribou
beef
and
so
forth
they
hung
as
they
hoped
out
of
the
reach
of
any
prowling
beast
and
finally
and
most
important
was
the
wood
pile
this
they
accumulated
to
the
north
and
east
of
the
hut
and
all
day
long
with
a
sort
of
perseverance
trafford
added
to
it
from
the
thickets
below
once
or
twice
however
tempted
by
the
appearance
of
birds
he
went
shooting
and
one
day
he
got
five
geese
that
they
spent
a
day
upon
plucking
cleaning
boiling
and
putting
up
in
all
their
store
of
empty
cans
letting
the
fat
float
and
solidify
on
the
top
to
preserve
this
addition
to
their
provision
until
the
advent
of
the
frost
rendered
all
other
preservatives
unnecessary
they
also
tried
to
catch
trout
down
in
the
river
below
but
though
they
saw
many
fish
the
catch
was
less
than
a
dozen
it
was
a
discovery
to
both
of
them
to
find
how
companionable
these
occupations
were
how
much
more
side
by
side
they
could
be
amateurishly
cleaning
out
a
goose
and
disputing
about
its
cooking
than
they
had
ever
contrived
to
be
in
sussex
square
these
things
are
so
infernally
interesting
said
trafford
surveying
the
row
of
miscellaneous
cans
upon
the
stove
he
had
packed
with
disarticulated
goose
but
we
did
come
here
to
picnic
all
this
is
eating
us
up
i
have
a
memory
of
some
immense
tragic
purpose
that
tin
screamed
marjorie
sharply
he
resumed
his
thread
after
an
active
interlude
we
keep
the
wolf
from
the
door
he
said
do
talk
of
wolves
said
marjorie
it
is
only
when
men
have
driven
away
the
wolf
from
the
door
oh
altogether
away
that
they
find
despair
in
the
sky
i
wonder
what
asked
marjorie
in
his
pause
i
wonder
if
there
is
nothing
really
in
life
but
this
the
food
hunt
and
the
love
hunt
is
life
just
all
hunger
and
need
and
are
we
left
with
nothing
nothing
at
all
when
these
things
are
done
infernally
uncomfortable
here
oh
nonsense
cried
marjorie
think
of
your
carpets
at
home
think
of
the
great
warm
beautiful
house
that
was
big
enough
and
yet
here
we
happy
we
happy
said
marjorie
struck
by
the
thought
only
yes
i
afraid
and
i
long
for
the
children
and
the
wind
it
may
be
those
are
good
things
for
us
no
this
is
just
a
lark
as
yet
marjorie
it
still
fresh
and
full
of
distractions
the
discomforts
are
amusing
presently
we
get
used
to
it
then
we
talk
out
what
we
have
to
talk
out
i
say
would
it
keep
and
improve
this
goose
of
ours
if
we
put
in
a
little
brandy
the
weather
broke
at
last
one
might
say
it
smashed
itself
over
their
heads
there
came
an
afternoon
darkness
swift
and
sudden
a
wild
gale
and
an
icy
sleet
that
gave
place
in
the
night
to
snow
so
that
trafford
looked
out
next
morning
to
see
a
maddening
chaos
of
small
white
flakes
incredibly
swift
against
something
that
was
neither
darkness
nor
light
even
with
the
door
but
partly
ajar
a
cruelty
of
cold
put
its
claw
within
set
everything
that
was
moveable
swaying
and
clattering
and
made
marjorie
hasten
shuddering
to
heap
fresh
logs
upon
the
fire
once
or
twice
trafford
went
out
to
inspect
tent
and
roof
and
several
times
wrapped
to
the
nose
he
battled
his
way
for
fresh
wood
and
for
the
rest
of
the
blizzard
they
kept
to
the
hut
it
was
slumberously
stuffy
but
comfortingly
full
of
flavours
of
tobacco
and
food
there
were
two
days
of
intermission
and
a
day
of
gusts
and
icy
sleet
again
turning
with
one
extraordinary
clap
of
thunder
to
a
wild
downpour
of
dancing
lumps
of
ice
and
then
a
night
when
it
seemed
all
labrador
earth
and
sky
together
was
in
hysterical
protest
against
inconceivable
wrongs
and
then
the
break
was
over
the
annual
was
accomplished
winter
had
established
itself
the
snowfall
moderated
and
ceased
and
an
world
shone
white
and
sunlit
under
a
cloudless
sky
through
all
that
time
they
got
no
further
with
the
great
discussion
for
which
they
had
faced
that
solitude
they
attempted
beginnings
where
had
we
got
to
when
we
left
england
cried
marjorie
you
could
work
you
could
rest
you
hated
our
life
yes
i
know
i
had
a
violent
hatred
of
the
lives
we
were
leading
i
thought
we
had
to
get
away
to
think
but
things
do
leave
us
alone
here
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
why
did
we
come
here
he
asked
you
wanted
to
get
out
of
things
yes
but
with
you
have
we
after
all
got
out
of
things
at
all
i
said
coming
up
perhaps
we
were
leaving
our
own
problem
behind
in
exchange
for
other
problems
old
problems
men
have
had
before
we
got
nearer
necessity
that
all
things
press
on
us
just
as
much
nothing
more
fundamental
in
wild
nature
nothing
profounder
only
something
earlier
one
does
get
out
of
life
by
going
here
or
there
but
i
wanted
to
get
you
away
from
all
things
that
had
such
a
hold
on
you
when
one
lies
awake
at
nights
then
one
seems
to
get
down
into
things
he
went
to
the
door
opened
it
and
stood
looking
out
against
a
wan
daylight
the
snow
was
falling
noiselessly
and
steadily
everything
goes
on
he
said
relentlessly
that
was
as
far
as
they
had
got
when
the
storms
ceased
and
they
came
out
again
into
an
air
inexpressibly
fresh
and
sharp
and
sweet
and
into
a
world
blindingly
clean
and
golden
white
under
the
rays
of
the
morning
sun
we
will
build
a
fire
out
here
said
marjorie
make
a
great
pile
there
is
no
reason
at
all
why
we
should
live
outside
all
through
the
day
in
such
weather
as
this
one
morning
trafford
found
the
footmarks
of
some
catlike
creature
in
the
snow
near
the
bushes
where
he
was
accustomed
to
get
firewood
they
led
away
very
plainly
up
the
hill
and
after
breakfast
he
took
his
knife
and
rifle
and
snowshoes
and
went
after
the
lynx
for
that
he
decided
the
animal
must
be
there
was
no
urgent
reason
why
he
should
want
to
kill
a
lynx
unless
perhaps
that
killing
it
made
the
store
shed
a
trifle
safer
but
it
was
the
first
trail
of
any
living
thing
for
many
days
it
promised
excitement
some
primordial
instinct
perhaps
urged
him
the
morning
was
a
little
overcast
and
very
cold
between
the
gleams
of
wintry
sunshine
dear
wife
he
said
and
then
as
she
remembered
afterwards
came
back
a
dozen
yards
to
kiss
her
i
not
be
long
he
said
the
beast
prowling
and
if
it
does
get
wind
of
me
i
ought
to
find
it
in
an
hour
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
i
not
be
long
he
repeated
and
she
had
an
instant
wonder
whether
he
hid
from
her
the
same
dread
of
loneliness
that
she
concealed
or
perhaps
he
only
knew
her
secret
up
among
the
tumbled
rocks
he
turned
and
she
was
still
watching
him
he
cried
and
waved
and
the
willow
thickets
closed
about
him
she
forced
herself
to
the
petty
duties
of
the
day
made
up
the
fire
from
the
pile
he
had
left
for
her
set
water
to
boil
put
the
hut
in
order
brought
out
sheets
and
blankets
to
air
and
set
herself
to
wash
up
she
wished
she
had
been
able
to
go
with
him
the
sky
cleared
presently
and
the
low
december
sun
lit
all
the
world
about
her
but
it
left
her
spirit
desolate
she
did
not
expect
him
to
return
until
and
she
sat
herself
down
on
a
log
before
the
fire
to
darn
a
pair
of
socks
as
well
as
she
could
for
a
time
this
unusual
occupation
held
her
attention
and
then
her
hands
became
slow
and
at
last
inactive
and
she
fell
into
reverie
she
thought
at
first
of
her
children
and
what
they
might
be
doing
in
england
across
there
to
the
east
it
would
be
about
five
hours
later
four
in
the
afternoon
and
the
children
would
be
coming
home
through
the
warm
muggy
london
sunshine
with
fraulein
otto
to
tea
she
wondered
if
they
had
the
proper
clothes
if
they
were
well
were
they
perhaps
quarrelling
or
being
naughty
or
skylarking
gaily
across
the
park
of
course
fraulein
otto
was
all
right
quite
to
be
trusted
absolutely
trustworthy
and
their
grandmother
would
watch
for
a
flushed
face
or
an
irrational
petulance
or
any
of
the
little
signs
that
herald
trouble
with
more
than
a
mother
instinctive
alertness
no
need
to
worry
about
the
children
no
need
whatever
the
world
of
london
opened
out
behind
these
thoughts
it
was
so
queer
to
think
that
she
was
in
almost
the
same
latitude
as
the
busy
bright
traffic
of
the
autumn
season
in
kensington
gore
that
away
there
in
ten
thousand
cleverly
furnished
the
ringing
tea
things
were
being
set
out
for
the
rustling
advent
of
smart
callers
and
the
quick
leaping
gossip
and
there
would
be
all
sorts
of
cakes
and
little
things
for
a
while
her
mind
ran
on
cakes
and
little
things
and
she
thought
in
particular
whether
it
was
time
to
begin
cooking
not
yet
what
was
it
she
had
been
thinking
about
ah
the
solomonsons
and
the
capeses
and
the
bernards
and
the
carmels
and
the
lees
would
they
talk
of
her
and
trafford
it
would
be
strange
to
go
back
to
it
all
would
they
go
back
to
it
all
she
found
herself
thinking
intently
of
trafford
what
a
fine
human
being
he
was
and
how
touchingly
human
the
thoughts
of
his
moments
of
irritation
his
baffled
silences
filled
her
with
a
wild
passion
of
tenderness
she
had
disappointed
him
all
that
life
failed
to
satisfy
him
dear
master
of
her
life
what
was
it
he
needed
she
too
was
satisfied
with
life
but
while
she
had
been
able
to
assuage
herself
with
a
perpetual
series
of
petty
excitements
theatres
new
books
and
new
people
meetings
movements
dinners
shows
he
had
grown
to
an
immense
discontent
he
had
most
of
the
things
men
sought
wealth
respect
love
children
so
many
men
might
have
blunted
their
with
adventures
there
were
pretty
women
clever
women
unoccupied
women
she
felt
she
would
have
minded
if
it
made
him
happy
it
was
so
wonderful
he
loved
her
still
it
was
that
he
lacked
occupation
on
the
whole
he
overworked
his
business
interests
were
big
and
wide
ought
he
to
go
into
politics
why
was
it
that
the
researches
that
had
held
him
once
could
hold
him
now
no
more
that
was
the
real
pity
of
it
was
she
to
blame
for
that
she
state
a
case
against
herself
and
yet
she
felt
she
was
to
blame
she
had
taken
him
away
from
those
things
forced
him
to
make
money
she
sat
chin
on
hand
staring
into
the
fire
the
sock
forgotten
on
her
knee
she
could
not
weigh
justice
between
herself
and
him
if
he
was
unhappy
it
was
her
fault
she
knew
if
he
was
unhappy
it
was
no
excuse
that
she
had
not
known
had
been
misled
had
a
right
to
her
own
instincts
and
purposes
she
had
got
to
make
him
happy
but
what
was
she
to
do
what
was
there
for
her
to
do
only
he
could
work
out
his
own
salvation
and
until
he
had
light
all
she
could
do
was
to
stand
by
him
help
him
cease
to
irritate
him
watch
wait
anyhow
she
could
at
least
mend
his
socks
as
well
as
possible
so
that
the
threads
would
not
chafe
him
she
flashed
to
her
feet
what
was
that
it
seemed
to
her
she
had
heard
the
sound
of
a
shot
and
a
quick
brief
wake
of
echoes
she
looked
across
the
icy
waste
of
the
river
and
then
up
the
tangled
slopes
of
the
mountain
her
heart
was
beating
very
fast
it
must
have
been
up
there
and
no
doubt
he
had
killed
his
beast
some
shadow
of
doubt
she
would
not
admit
crossed
that
obvious
suggestion
this
wilderness
was
making
her
as
nervously
responsive
as
a
creature
of
the
wild
came
a
second
shot
this
time
there
was
no
doubt
of
it
then
the
desolate
silence
closed
about
her
again
she
stood
for
a
long
time
staring
at
the
shrubby
slopes
that
rose
to
the
barren
rock
wilderness
of
the
purple
mountain
crest
she
sighed
deeply
at
last
and
set
herself
to
make
up
the
fire
and
prepare
for
the
meal
once
far
away
across
the
river
she
heard
the
howl
of
a
wolf
time
seemed
to
pass
very
slowly
that
day
she
found
herself
going
repeatedly
to
the
space
between
the
day
tent
and
the
sleeping
hut
from
which
she
could
see
the
stunted
wood
that
had
swallowed
him
up
and
after
what
seemed
a
long
hour
her
watch
told
her
it
was
still
only
twelve
and
the
fourth
or
fifth
time
that
she
went
to
look
out
she
was
set
atremble
again
by
the
sound
of
a
third
shot
and
then
at
regular
intervals
out
of
that
distant
brown
purple
jumble
of
thickets
against
the
snow
came
two
more
shots
something
has
happened
she
said
something
has
happened
and
stood
rigid
then
she
became
active
seized
the
rifle
that
was
always
at
hand
when
she
was
alone
fired
into
the
sky
and
stood
listening
prompt
come
an
answering
shot
he
wants
me
said
marjorie
something
perhaps
he
has
killed
something
too
big
to
bring
she
was
for
starting
at
once
and
then
remembered
this
was
not
the
way
of
the
wilderness
she
thought
and
moved
very
rapidly
her
mind
catalogued
possible
requirements
rifle
hunting
knife
the
oilskin
bag
with
matches
and
some
chunks
of
dry
paper
the
rucksack
and
he
would
be
hungry
she
took
a
saucepan
and
a
huge
chunk
of
cheese
and
biscuit
then
a
brandy
flask
is
sometimes
handy
one
never
knows
though
nothing
was
wrong
of
course
needles
and
stout
thread
and
some
cord
snowshoes
a
waterproof
cloak
could
be
easily
carried
her
light
hatchet
for
wood
she
cast
about
to
see
if
there
was
anything
else
she
had
almost
forgotten
cartridges
and
a
revolver
nothing
more
she
kicked
a
stray
brand
or
so
into
the
fire
put
on
some
more
wood
damped
the
fire
with
an
armful
of
snow
to
make
it
last
longer
and
set
out
towards
the
willows
into
which
he
had
vanished
there
was
a
rustling
and
snapping
of
branches
as
she
pushed
her
way
through
the
bushes
a
little
stir
that
died
insensibly
into
quiet
again
and
then
the
camping
place
became
very
still
scarcely
a
sound
occurred
except
for
the
little
shuddering
and
stirring
of
the
fire
and
the
reluctant
infrequent
drip
from
the
icicles
along
the
sunny
edge
of
the
log
hut
roof
about
one
the
amber
sunshine
faded
out
altogether
a
veil
of
clouds
thickened
and
became
greyly
ominous
and
a
little
after
two
the
first
flakes
of
a
snowstorm
fell
hissing
into
the
fire
a
wind
rose
and
drove
the
multiplying
snowflakes
in
whirls
and
eddies
before
it
the
icicles
ceased
to
drip
but
one
or
two
broke
and
fell
with
a
weak
tinkling
a
deep
soughing
a
shuddering
groaning
of
trees
and
shrubs
came
ever
and
again
out
of
the
ravine
and
the
powdery
snow
blew
like
puffs
of
smoke
from
the
branches
by
four
the
fire
was
out
and
the
snow
was
piling
high
in
the
darkling
twilight
against
tent
and
hut
trafford
trail
led
marjorie
through
the
thicket
of
dwarf
willows
and
down
to
the
gully
of
the
rivulet
which
they
had
called
marjorie
trickle
it
had
long
since
become
a
trough
of
rotten
ice
the
trail
crossed
this
and
turning
sharply
uphill
went
on
until
it
was
clear
of
shrubs
and
trees
and
in
the
windy
open
of
the
upper
slopes
it
crossed
a
ridge
and
came
over
the
lip
of
a
large
desolate
valley
with
slopes
of
ice
and
icy
snow
here
she
spent
some
time
in
following
his
loops
back
on
the
homeward
trail
before
she
saw
what
was
manifestly
the
final
trail
running
far
away
out
across
the
snow
with
the
spoor
of
the
lynx
a
line
to
the
right
of
it
she
followed
this
suggestion
of
the
trail
put
on
her
snowshoes
and
shuffled
her
way
across
this
valley
which
opened
as
she
proceeded
she
hoped
that
over
the
ridge
she
would
find
trafford
and
scanned
the
sky
for
the
faintest
discolouration
of
a
fire
but
there
was
none
that
seemed
odd
to
her
but
the
wind
was
in
her
face
and
perhaps
it
beat
the
smoke
down
then
as
her
eyes
scanned
the
hummocky
ridge
ahead
she
saw
something
something
very
intent
and
still
that
brought
her
heart
into
her
mouth
it
was
a
big
grey
wolf
standing
with
back
haunched
and
head
down
watching
and
winding
something
beyond
there
out
of
sight
marjorie
had
an
instinctive
fear
of
wild
animals
and
it
still
seemed
dreadful
to
her
that
they
should
go
at
large
uncaged
she
suddenly
wanted
trafford
violently
wanted
him
by
her
side
also
she
thought
of
leaving
the
trail
going
back
to
the
bushes
she
had
to
take
herself
in
hand
in
the
wastes
one
did
not
fear
wild
beasts
one
had
no
fear
of
them
but
why
not
fire
a
shot
to
let
him
know
she
was
near
the
beast
flashed
round
with
an
animal
instantaneous
change
of
pose
and
looked
at
her
for
a
couple
of
seconds
perhaps
woman
and
brute
regarded
one
another
across
a
quarter
of
a
mile
of
snowy
desolation
suppose
it
came
towards
her
she
would
fire
and
she
would
fire
at
it
she
made
a
guess
at
the
range
and
aimed
very
carefully
she
saw
the
snow
fly
two
yards
ahead
of
the
grisly
shape
and
then
in
an
instant
it
had
vanished
over
the
crest
she
reloaded
and
stood
for
a
moment
waiting
for
trafford
answer
no
answer
came
queer
she
whispered
queer
and
suddenly
such
a
horror
of
anticipation
assailed
her
that
she
started
running
and
floundering
through
the
snow
to
escape
it
twice
she
called
his
name
and
once
she
just
stopped
herself
from
firing
a
shot
over
the
ridge
she
would
find
him
surely
she
would
find
him
over
the
ridge
she
found
herself
among
rocks
and
there
was
a
beaten
and
trampled
place
where
trafford
must
have
waited
and
crouched
then
on
and
down
a
slope
of
tumbled
boulders
there
came
a
patch
where
he
had
either
thrown
himself
down
or
fallen
it
seemed
to
her
he
must
have
been
running
suddenly
a
hundred
feet
or
so
away
she
saw
a
patch
of
violently
disturbed
snow
snow
stained
a
dreadful
colour
a
snow
of
scarlet
crystals
three
strides
and
trafford
was
in
sight
she
had
a
swift
conviction
he
was
dead
he
was
lying
in
a
crumpled
attitude
on
a
patch
of
snow
between
convergent
rocks
and
the
lynx
a
mass
of
blood
smeared
silvery
fur
was
in
some
way
mixed
up
with
him
she
saw
as
she
came
nearer
that
the
snow
was
disturbed
round
about
them
and
discoloured
copiously
yellow
widely
and
in
places
bright
red
with
congealed
and
frozen
blood
she
felt
no
fear
now
and
no
emotion
all
her
mind
was
engaged
with
the
clear
bleak
perception
of
the
fact
before
her
she
did
not
care
to
call
to
him
again
his
head
was
hidden
by
the
lynx
body
it
was
as
if
he
was
burrowing
underneath
the
creature
his
legs
were
twisted
about
each
other
in
a
queer
unnatural
attitude
then
as
she
dropped
off
a
boulder
and
came
nearer
trafford
moved
a
hand
came
out
and
gripped
the
rifle
beside
him
he
suddenly
lifted
a
dreadful
face
horribly
scarred
and
torn
and
crimson
with
frozen
blood
he
pushed
the
grey
beast
aside
rose
on
an
elbow
wiped
his
sleeve
across
his
eyes
stared
at
her
grunted
and
flopped
forward
he
had
fainted
she
was
now
as
and
as
as
a
woman
in
a
shop
in
another
moment
she
was
kneeling
by
his
side
she
saw
by
the
position
of
his
knife
and
the
huge
rip
in
the
beast
body
that
he
had
stabbed
the
lynx
to
death
as
it
clawed
his
head
he
must
have
shot
and
wounded
it
and
then
fallen
upon
it
his
knitted
cap
was
torn
to
ribbons
and
hung
upon
his
neck
also
his
leg
was
manifestly
injured
how
she
could
not
tell
it
was
chiefly
evident
he
must
freeze
if
he
lay
here
it
seemed
to
her
that
perhaps
he
had
pulled
the
dead
brute
over
him
to
protect
his
torn
skin
from
the
extremity
of
cold
the
lynx
was
already
rigid
its
clumsy
paws
asprawl
the
torn
skin
and
clot
upon
face
was
stiff
as
she
put
her
hands
about
his
head
to
raise
him
she
turned
him
over
on
his
back
how
heavy
he
seemed
and
forced
brandy
between
his
teeth
then
after
a
moment
hesitation
she
poured
a
little
brandy
on
his
wounds
she
glanced
at
his
leg
which
was
surely
broken
and
back
at
his
face
then
she
gave
him
more
brandy
and
his
eyelids
flickered
he
moved
his
hand
weakly
the
blood
he
said
kept
getting
in
my
eyes
she
gave
him
brandy
once
again
wiped
his
face
and
glanced
at
his
leg
something
ought
to
be
done
to
that
she
thought
but
things
must
be
done
in
order
she
stared
up
at
the
darkling
sky
with
its
grey
promise
of
snow
and
down
the
slopes
of
the
mountain
clearly
they
must
stay
the
night
here
they
were
too
high
for
wood
among
these
rocks
but
three
or
four
hundred
yards
below
there
were
a
number
of
dwarfed
fir
trees
she
had
brought
an
axe
so
that
a
fire
was
possible
should
she
go
back
to
camp
and
get
the
tent
trafford
was
trying
to
speak
again
i
got
he
said
yes
got
my
leg
in
that
crack
damn
damned
nuisance
was
he
able
to
advise
her
she
looked
at
him
and
then
perceived
she
must
bind
up
his
head
and
face
she
knelt
behind
him
and
raised
his
head
on
her
knee
she
had
a
thick
silk
neck
muffler
and
this
she
supplemented
by
a
band
she
cut
and
tore
from
her
inner
vest
she
bound
this
still
warm
from
her
body
about
him
wrapped
her
cloak
round
him
the
next
thing
was
a
fire
five
yards
away
perhaps
a
great
mass
of
purple
gabbro
hung
over
a
patch
of
nearly
snowless
moss
a
hummock
to
the
westward
offered
shelter
from
the
weakly
bitter
wind
the
icy
draught
that
was
soughing
down
the
valley
always
in
labrador
if
you
can
you
camp
against
a
rock
surface
it
shelters
you
from
the
wind
reflects
your
fire
guards
your
back
rag
she
said
rotten
hole
said
trafford
what
she
cried
sharply
got
you
in
a
rotten
hole
he
said
eh
listen
she
said
and
shook
his
shoulder
look
i
want
to
get
you
up
against
that
rock
wo
make
much
difference
said
trafford
and
opened
his
eyes
where
he
asked
there
he
remained
quite
quiet
for
a
second
perhaps
listen
to
me
he
said
go
back
to
camp
yes
she
said
go
back
to
camp
make
a
pack
of
all
the
strongest
food
strenthin
strengthrin
food
you
know
he
seemed
troubled
to
express
himself
yes
she
said
down
the
river
down
down
till
you
meet
help
leave
you
he
nodded
his
head
and
winced
you
always
plucky
he
said
look
facts
in
the
face
kiddies
thought
it
over
while
you
were
coming
a
tear
oozed
from
his
eye
not
be
a
fool
madge
kiss
me
not
be
a
fool
i
done
kids
she
stared
at
him
and
her
spirit
was
a
luminous
mist
of
tears
you
old
she
said
in
his
ear
and
kissed
the
little
patch
of
rough
and
bloody
cheek
beneath
his
eye
then
she
knelt
up
beside
him
boss
now
old
man
she
said
i
want
to
get
you
to
that
place
there
under
the
rock
if
i
drag
can
you
help
he
answered
obstinately
you
better
go
i
make
you
comfortable
first
she
answered
anyhow
he
made
an
enormous
effort
and
then
with
her
quick
help
and
with
his
back
to
her
knee
had
raised
himself
on
his
elbows
and
afterwards
he
asked
build
a
fire
wood
down
there
two
bits
of
wood
tied
on
my
leg
splints
then
i
can
drag
myself
see
like
a
blessed
old
walrus
he
smiled
and
she
kissed
his
bandaged
face
again
else
it
hurts
he
apologized
more
than
i
can
stand
she
stood
up
again
thought
put
his
rifle
and
knife
to
his
hand
for
fear
of
that
lurking
wolf
abandoning
her
own
rifle
with
an
effort
and
went
striding
and
leaping
from
rock
to
rock
towards
the
trees
below
she
made
the
chips
fly
and
was
presently
towing
three
venerable
pine
dwarfs
bumping
over
rock
and
crevice
back
to
trafford
she
flung
them
down
stood
for
a
moment
bright
and
breathless
then
set
herself
to
hack
off
the
splints
he
needed
from
the
biggest
stem
now
she
said
coming
to
him
a
fool
he
remarked
would
have
made
the
splints
down
there
you
marjorie
she
lugged
his
leg
out
straight
put
it
into
the
natural
and
least
painful
pose
padded
it
with
moss
and
her
torn
handkerchief
and
bound
it
up
as
she
did
so
a
handful
of
snowflakes
came
whirling
about
them
she
was
now
braced
up
to
every
possibility
it
never
rains
she
said
grimly
but
it
pours
and
went
on
with
her
he
was
badly
weakened
by
pain
and
shock
and
once
he
swore
at
her
sharply
sorry
he
said
she
rolled
him
over
on
his
chest
and
left
him
to
struggle
to
the
shelter
of
the
rock
while
she
went
for
more
wood
the
sky
alarmed
her
the
mountains
up
the
valley
were
already
hidden
by
driven
rags
of
slaty
snowstorms
this
time
she
found
a
longer
but
easier
path
for
dragging
her
boughs
and
trees
she
determined
she
would
not
start
the
fire
until
nightfall
nor
waste
any
time
in
preparing
food
until
then
there
were
dead
boughs
for
kindling
more
than
enough
it
was
snowing
quite
fast
by
the
time
she
got
up
to
him
with
her
second
load
and
a
premature
twilight
already
obscured
and
exaggerated
the
rocks
and
mounds
about
her
she
gave
some
of
her
cheese
to
trafford
and
gnawed
some
herself
on
her
way
down
to
the
wood
again
she
regretted
that
she
had
brought
neither
candles
nor
lantern
because
then
she
might
have
kept
on
until
the
cold
of
night
stopped
her
and
she
reproached
herself
bitterly
because
she
had
brought
no
tea
she
could
forgive
herself
the
lantern
she
had
never
expected
to
be
out
after
dark
but
the
tea
was
inexcusable
she
muttered
while
she
worked
like
two
men
among
the
trees
panting
puffs
of
mist
that
froze
upon
her
lips
and
iced
the
knitted
wool
that
covered
her
chin
why
do
they
teach
a
girl
to
handle
an
axe
when
at
last
the
wolfish
cold
of
the
labrador
night
had
come
it
found
trafford
and
marjorie
seated
almost
warmly
on
a
bed
of
pine
boughs
between
the
sheltering
dark
rock
behind
and
a
big
but
well
husbanded
fire
in
front
drinking
a
but
not
unsavory
soup
of
that
she
had
fortified
with
the
remainder
of
the
brandy
then
they
tried
roast
lynx
and
ate
a
little
and
finished
with
some
scraps
of
cheese
and
deep
draughts
of
hot
water
then
oh
tyburnia
and
chelsea
and
all
that
is
becoming
they
smoked
trafford
pipe
for
alternate
minutes
and
marjorie
found
great
comfort
in
it
the
snowstorm
poured
incessantly
out
of
the
darkness
to
become
flakes
of
burning
fire
in
the
light
of
the
flames
flakes
that
vanished
magically
but
it
only
reached
them
and
wetted
them
in
occasional
gusts
what
did
it
matter
for
the
moment
if
the
dim
rose
and
rose
about
them
a
glorious
fatigue
an
immense
possessed
marjorie
she
felt
that
they
had
both
done
well
i
am
not
afraid
of
now
she
said
at
last
a
thought
matured
trafford
had
the
pipe
and
did
not
speak
for
a
moment
nor
i
he
said
at
last
very
likely
we
get
through
with
it
he
added
after
a
pause
i
thought
i
was
done
for
a
man
loses
heart
after
a
loss
of
blood
the
leg
better
hot
as
fire
his
humour
had
left
him
it
a
treat
he
said
the
hottest
thing
in
labrador
i
been
a
good
squaw
this
time
old
man
she
asked
suddenly
he
seemed
not
to
hear
her
then
his
lips
twitched
and
he
made
a
feeble
movement
for
her
hand
i
cursed
you
he
said
she
slept
but
on
a
spring
as
it
were
lest
the
fire
should
fall
she
replenished
it
with
boughs
tucked
in
the
logs
and
went
to
sleep
again
then
it
seemed
to
her
that
some
invisible
hand
was
pouring
a
thin
spirit
on
the
flames
that
made
them
leap
and
crackle
and
spread
north
and
south
until
they
filled
the
heavens
her
eyes
were
open
and
the
snowstorm
overpast
leaving
the
sky
clear
and
all
the
westward
heaven
alight
with
the
trailing
crackling
leaping
curtains
of
the
aurora
brighter
than
she
had
ever
seen
them
before
quite
clearly
visible
beyond
the
smoulder
of
the
fire
a
wintry
waste
of
rock
and
snow
boulder
beyond
boulder
passed
into
a
dun
obscurity
the
mountain
to
the
right
of
them
lay
long
and
white
and
stiff
a
shrouded
death
all
earth
was
dead
and
waste
and
nothing
and
the
sky
alive
and
coldly
marvellous
signalling
and
astir
she
watched
the
changing
shifting
colours
and
they
made
her
think
of
the
gathering
banners
of
inhuman
hosts
the
stir
and
marshalling
of
icy
giants
for
ends
stupendous
and
indifferent
to
all
the
trivial
impertinence
of
man
existence
that
night
the
whole
world
of
man
seemed
small
and
shallow
and
insecure
to
her
beyond
comparison
one
came
she
thought
but
just
a
little
way
out
of
its
warm
and
sociable
cities
hither
and
found
this
homeless
wilderness
one
pricked
the
thin
appearances
of
life
with
microscope
or
telescope
and
came
to
an
equal
strangeness
all
the
pride
and
hope
of
human
life
goes
to
and
fro
in
a
little
shell
of
air
between
this
ancient
globe
of
rusty
and
the
void
of
space
faint
specks
we
are
within
a
film
we
quiver
between
the
atom
and
the
infinite
being
hardly
more
substantial
than
the
glow
within
an
oily
skin
that
drifts
upon
the
water
the
wonder
and
the
riddle
of
it
here
she
and
trafford
were
phantasmal
shapes
of
unsubstantial
fluid
thinly
skinned
against
evaporation
and
wrapped
about
with
woven
wool
and
the
skins
of
beasts
that
yet
reflected
and
perceived
suffered
and
sought
to
understand
that
held
a
million
memories
framed
thoughts
that
plumbed
the
deeps
of
space
and
time
and
another
day
of
snow
or
icy
wind
might
leave
them
just
scattered
bones
and
torn
rags
gnawed
by
a
famishing
wolf
she
felt
a
passionate
desire
to
pray
she
glanced
at
trafford
beside
her
and
found
him
awake
and
staring
his
face
was
very
pale
and
strange
in
that
livid
flickering
light
she
would
have
spoken
and
then
she
saw
his
lips
were
moving
and
something
something
she
did
not
understand
held
her
back
from
doing
so
the
bleak
slow
dawn
found
marjorie
intently
busy
she
had
made
up
the
fire
boiled
water
and
washed
and
dressed
trafford
wounds
and
made
another
soup
of
lynx
but
trafford
had
weakened
in
the
night
the
stuff
nauseated
him
he
refused
it
and
tried
to
smoke
and
was
sick
and
then
sat
back
rather
despairfully
after
a
second
attempt
to
persuade
her
to
leave
him
there
to
die
this
failure
of
his
spirit
distressed
her
and
a
little
astonished
her
but
it
only
made
her
more
resolute
to
go
through
with
her
work
she
had
awakened
cold
stiff
and
weary
but
her
fatigue
vanished
with
movement
she
toiled
for
an
hour
replenishing
her
pile
of
fuel
made
up
the
fire
put
his
gun
ready
to
his
hand
kissed
him
abused
him
lovingly
for
the
trouble
he
gave
her
until
his
poor
torn
face
lit
in
response
and
then
parting
on
a
note
of
cheerful
confidence
set
out
to
return
to
the
hut
she
found
the
way
not
altogether
easy
to
make
out
wind
and
snow
had
left
scarcely
a
trace
of
their
tracks
and
her
mind
was
full
of
the
stores
she
must
bring
and
the
possibility
of
moving
him
nearer
to
the
hut
she
was
startled
to
see
by
the
fresh
deep
spoor
along
the
ridge
how
near
the
wolf
had
dared
approach
them
in
the
darkness
ever
and
again
marjorie
had
to
halt
and
look
back
to
get
her
direction
right
as
it
was
she
came
through
the
willow
scrub
nearly
half
a
mile
above
the
hut
and
had
to
follow
the
steep
bank
of
the
frozen
river
down
at
one
place
she
nearly
slipped
upon
an
icy
slope
of
rock
one
possibility
she
did
not
dare
to
think
of
during
that
time
a
blizzard
now
would
cut
her
off
absolutely
from
any
return
to
trafford
short
of
that
she
believed
she
could
get
through
her
quick
mind
was
full
of
all
she
had
to
do
at
first
she
had
thought
chiefly
of
his
immediate
necessities
of
food
and
some
sort
of
shelter
she
had
got
a
list
of
things
in
her
head
meat
extract
bandages
corrosive
sublimate
by
way
of
antiseptic
brandy
a
tin
of
beef
some
bread
and
so
forth
she
went
over
that
several
times
to
be
sure
of
it
and
then
for
a
time
she
puzzled
about
a
tent
she
thought
she
could
manage
a
bale
of
blankets
on
her
back
and
that
she
could
rig
a
sleeping
tent
for
herself
and
trafford
with
one
and
some
bent
sticks
the
big
tent
would
be
too
much
to
strike
and
shift
and
then
her
mind
went
on
to
a
bolder
enterprise
which
was
to
get
him
home
the
nearer
she
could
bring
him
to
the
log
hut
the
nearer
they
would
be
to
supplies
she
cast
about
for
some
sort
of
sledge
the
snow
was
too
soft
and
broken
for
runners
especially
among
the
trees
but
if
she
could
get
a
flat
of
smooth
wood
she
thought
she
might
be
able
to
drag
him
she
decided
to
try
the
side
of
her
bunk
she
could
easily
get
that
off
she
would
have
of
course
to
run
it
edgewise
through
the
thickets
and
across
the
ravine
but
after
that
she
would
have
almost
clear
going
until
she
reached
the
steep
place
of
broken
rocks
within
two
hundred
yards
of
him
the
idea
of
a
sledge
grew
upon
her
and
she
planned
to
nail
a
rope
along
the
edge
and
make
a
kind
of
harness
for
herself
she
found
the
piled
high
with
drifted
snow
which
had
invaded
tent
and
hut
and
that
some
beast
a
wolverine
she
guessed
had
been
into
the
hut
devoured
every
and
the
uppers
of
trafford
second
boots
and
had
then
gone
to
the
corner
of
the
store
shed
and
clambered
up
to
the
stores
she
made
no
account
of
its
depredations
there
but
set
herself
to
make
a
sledge
and
get
her
supplies
together
there
was
a
gleam
of
sunshine
but
she
did
not
like
the
look
of
the
sky
and
she
was
horribly
afraid
of
what
might
be
happening
to
trafford
she
carried
her
stuff
through
the
wood
and
across
the
ravine
and
returned
for
her
improvised
sledge
she
was
still
struggling
with
that
among
the
trees
when
it
began
to
snow
again
it
was
hard
then
not
to
be
frantic
in
her
efforts
as
it
was
she
packed
her
stuff
so
loosely
on
the
planking
that
she
had
to
repack
it
and
she
started
without
putting
on
her
snowshoes
and
floundered
fifty
yards
before
she
discovered
that
omission
the
snow
was
now
falling
fast
darkling
the
sky
and
hiding
everything
but
objects
close
at
hand
and
she
had
to
use
all
her
wits
to
determine
her
direction
she
knew
she
must
go
down
a
long
slope
and
then
up
to
the
ridge
and
it
came
to
her
as
a
happy
inspiration
that
if
she
bore
to
the
left
she
might
strike
some
recognizable
vestige
of
her
morning
trail
she
had
read
of
people
walking
in
circles
when
they
have
no
light
or
guidance
and
that
troubled
her
until
she
bethought
herself
of
the
little
compass
on
her
watch
chain
by
that
she
kept
her
direction
she
wished
very
much
she
had
timed
herself
across
the
waste
so
that
she
could
tell
when
she
approached
the
ridge
soon
her
back
and
shoulders
were
aching
violently
and
the
rope
across
her
chest
was
tugging
like
some
thing
but
she
did
not
dare
to
rest
the
snow
was
now
falling
thick
and
fast
the
flakes
traced
white
spirals
and
made
her
head
spin
so
that
she
was
constantly
falling
away
to
the
and
then
correcting
herself
by
the
compass
she
tried
to
think
how
this
might
affect
her
course
but
the
snow
whirls
confused
her
mind
and
a
growing
anxiety
would
not
let
her
pause
to
think
she
felt
blinded
it
seemed
to
be
snowing
inside
her
eyes
so
that
she
wanted
to
rub
them
soon
the
ground
must
rise
to
the
ridge
she
told
herself
it
must
surely
rise
then
the
sledge
came
bumping
at
her
heels
and
she
perceived
she
was
going
down
hill
she
consulted
the
compass
and
she
found
she
was
facing
south
she
turned
sharply
to
the
right
again
the
snowfall
became
a
noiseless
pitiless
torture
to
sight
and
mind
the
sledge
behind
her
struggled
to
hold
her
back
and
the
snow
balled
under
her
snowshoes
she
wanted
to
stop
and
rest
take
thought
sit
for
a
moment
she
struggled
with
herself
and
kept
on
she
tried
walking
with
shut
eyes
and
tripped
and
came
near
sprawling
oh
god
she
cried
oh
god
too
stupefied
for
more
articulate
prayers
would
the
rise
of
the
ground
to
the
ribs
of
rock
never
come
a
figure
black
and
erect
stood
in
front
of
her
suddenly
and
beyond
appeared
a
group
of
black
straight
antagonists
she
staggered
on
towards
them
gripping
her
rifle
with
some
muddled
idea
of
defence
and
in
another
moment
she
was
brushing
against
the
branches
of
a
stunted
fir
which
shed
thick
lumps
of
snow
upon
her
feet
what
trees
were
these
had
she
ever
passed
any
trees
no
there
were
no
trees
on
her
way
to
trafford
she
began
whimpering
like
a
tormented
child
but
even
as
she
wept
she
turned
her
sledge
about
to
follow
the
edge
of
the
wood
she
was
too
much
downhill
she
thought
and
she
must
bear
up
again
she
left
the
trees
behind
made
an
angle
uphill
to
the
right
and
was
presently
among
trees
again
again
she
left
them
and
again
came
back
to
them
she
screamed
with
anger
at
them
and
twitched
her
sledge
away
she
wiped
at
the
snowstorm
with
her
arm
as
though
she
would
wipe
it
away
she
wanted
to
stamp
on
the
universe
and
she
ached
she
ached
something
caught
her
eye
ahead
something
that
gleamed
it
was
exactly
like
a
long
bare
rather
pinkish
bone
standing
erect
on
the
ground
just
because
it
was
strange
and
queer
she
ran
forward
to
it
then
as
she
came
nearer
she
perceived
it
was
a
streak
of
barked
trunk
a
branch
had
been
torn
off
a
pine
tree
and
the
bark
stripped
down
to
the
root
and
then
her
foot
hit
against
a
freshly
hewn
stump
and
then
came
another
poking
its
pinkish
wounds
above
the
snow
and
there
were
chips
this
filled
her
with
wonder
some
one
had
been
cutting
wood
there
must
be
indians
or
trappers
near
she
thought
and
then
realized
the
could
be
none
other
than
herself
she
turned
to
the
right
and
saw
the
rocks
rising
steeply
close
at
hand
oh
rag
she
cried
and
fired
her
rifle
in
the
air
ten
seconds
twenty
seconds
and
then
so
loud
and
near
it
amazed
her
came
his
answering
shot
it
sounded
like
the
hillside
bursting
in
another
moment
she
had
discovered
the
trail
she
had
made
overnight
and
that
morning
by
dragging
firewood
it
was
now
a
shallow
soft
white
trench
instantly
her
despair
and
fatigue
had
gone
from
her
should
she
take
a
load
of
wood
with
her
she
asked
herself
in
addition
to
the
weight
behind
her
and
had
a
better
idea
she
would
unload
and
pile
her
stuff
here
and
bring
him
down
on
the
sledge
closer
to
the
wood
she
looked
about
and
saw
two
rocks
that
diverged
with
a
space
between
she
flashed
schemes
she
would
trample
the
snow
hard
and
flat
put
her
sledge
on
it
pile
boughs
and
make
a
canopy
of
blanket
overhead
and
behind
then
a
fire
in
front
she
saw
her
camp
admirable
she
tossed
her
provisions
down
and
ran
up
the
broad
windings
of
her
trail
to
trafford
with
the
unloaded
sledge
bumping
behind
her
she
ran
as
lightly
as
though
she
had
done
nothing
that
day
she
found
him
markedly
recovered
weak
and
quiet
with
snow
drifting
over
his
feet
his
rifle
across
his
knees
and
his
pipe
alight
back
already
he
said
but
he
hesitated
no
grub
she
knelt
over
him
gave
his
rough
unshaven
cheek
a
swift
kiss
and
very
rapidly
explained
her
plan
in
three
days
time
they
were
back
at
the
hut
and
the
last
two
days
they
wore
blue
spectacles
because
of
the
glare
of
the
sunlit
snow
it
amazed
marjorie
to
discover
as
she
lay
awake
in
the
camp
on
the
edge
of
the
ravine
close
to
the
hut
to
which
she
had
lugged
trafford
during
the
second
day
that
she
was
deeply
happy
it
was
preposterous
that
she
should
be
so
but
those
days
of
almost
despairful
stress
were
irradiated
now
by
a
new
courage
she
was
doing
this
thing
against
all
labrador
and
the
wind
that
blew
from
the
polar
wilderness
she
was
winning
it
was
a
great
discovery
to
her
that
hardship
and
effort
almost
to
the
could
ensue
in
so
deep
a
satisfaction
she
lay
and
thought
how
deep
and
rich
life
had
become
for
her
as
though
in
all
this
effort
and
struggle
some
unsuspected
veil
had
been
torn
away
she
perceived
again
but
now
with
no
sense
of
desolation
that
same
infinite
fragility
of
life
which
she
had
first
perceived
when
she
had
watched
the
aurora
borealis
flickering
up
the
sky
beneath
that
realization
and
carrying
it
as
a
river
flood
may
carry
scum
was
a
sense
of
herself
as
something
deeper
greater
more
enduring
than
mountain
or
wilderness
or
sky
or
any
of
those
monstrous
forms
of
nature
that
had
dwarfed
her
physical
self
to
nothingness
she
had
a
persuasion
of
self
detachment
and
illumination
and
withal
of
she
saw
her
life
of
time
and
space
for
what
it
was
away
in
london
the
children
with
the
coldest
of
noses
and
the
gayest
of
spirits
would
be
scampering
about
their
bedrooms
in
the
mild
morning
sunlight
of
a
london
winter
elsie
the
parlourmaid
would
be
whisking
dexterous
about
the
the
bacon
would
be
cooking
and
the
at
work
the
letters
of
the
morning
delivery
perhaps
just
pattering
into
the
and
all
the
bright
little
household
she
had
made
with
all
the
furniture
she
had
arranged
all
the
characteristic
decoration
she
had
given
it
all
the
clever
convenient
arrangements
would
be
getting
itself
into
action
for
another
day
and
was
herself
it
was
the
extremest
of
her
superficiality
she
had
come
out
of
all
that
and
even
so
it
seemed
she
had
come
out
of
herself
this
weary
woman
lying
awake
on
the
balsam
boughs
with
a
brain
cleared
by
underfeeding
and
this
continuous
arduous
bath
of
toil
in
frost
cleansed
starry
air
this
too
was
no
more
than
a
momentarily
clarified
window
for
her
unknown
and
indefinable
reality
what
was
that
reality
what
was
she
herself
she
became
interested
in
framing
an
answer
to
that
and
slipped
down
from
the
peace
of
soul
she
had
attained
her
serenity
gave
way
to
a
reiteration
of
this
question
reiterations
increasing
and
at
last
oppressing
like
the
snowflakes
of
a
storm
perpetual
whirling
repetitions
that
at
last
confused
her
and
hid
the
sky
she
fell
asleep
with
their
return
to
the
hut
marjorie
had
found
herself
encountering
a
new
set
of
urgencies
in
their
absence
that
wretched
little
wolverine
had
found
great
plenty
and
happiness
in
the
tent
and
its
traces
were
manifest
nearly
everywhere
and
it
had
particularly
assailed
the
candles
after
a
destructive
time
among
the
frozen
caribou
beef
it
had
clambered
up
on
the
packages
of
sardines
and
jumped
thence
on
to
a
sloping
pole
that
it
could
claw
along
into
the
frame
of
the
roof
she
rearranged
the
packages
but
that
was
no
good
she
could
not
leave
trafford
in
order
to
track
the
brute
down
and
for
a
night
or
so
she
could
not
think
of
any
way
of
checking
its
depredations
it
came
each
night
trafford
kept
her
close
at
home
she
had
expected
that
when
he
was
back
in
his
bunk
secure
and
warm
he
would
heal
rapidly
but
instead
he
suddenly
developed
all
the
symptoms
of
a
severe
feverish
cold
and
his
scars
which
had
seemed
healing
became
flushed
and
moreover
there
was
something
wrong
with
his
leg
an
ominous
ache
that
troubled
her
mind
every
woman
she
decided
ought
to
know
how
to
set
a
bone
he
was
unable
to
sleep
by
reason
of
these
miseries
though
very
desirous
of
doing
so
he
became
distressingly
weak
and
inert
he
ceased
to
care
for
food
and
presently
he
began
ta
talk
to
himself
with
a
complete
disregard
of
her
presence
hourly
she
regretted
her
ignorance
of
medicine
that
left
her
with
no
conceivable
remedy
for
all
the
aching
and
gnawing
that
worried
and
weakened
him
except
bathing
with
antiseptics
and
a
liberal
use
of
quinine
and
his
face
became
strange
to
her
for
over
his
flushed
and
sunken
cheeks
under
the
raw
spaces
of
the
scar
a
blond
beard
bristled
and
grew
presently
trafford
was
a
bearded
man
incidentally
however
she
killed
the
wolverine
by
means
of
a
trap
of
her
own
contrivance
a
loaded
rifle
with
a
bait
of
what
was
nearly
her
last
candles
rigged
to
the
trigger
but
this
loss
of
the
candles
brought
home
to
them
the
steady
lengthening
of
the
nights
scarcely
seven
hours
of
day
remained
now
in
the
black
cold
grip
of
the
darkness
and
through
those
seventeen
hours
of
chill
aggression
they
had
no
light
but
the
red
glow
of
the
stove
she
had
to
close
the
door
of
the
hut
and
bar
every
chink
and
cranny
against
the
icy
air
that
became
at
last
a
murderous
freezing
wind
not
only
did
she
line
the
hut
with
every
scrap
of
skin
and
paper
she
could
obtain
but
she
went
out
with
the
spade
toiling
for
three
laborious
afternoons
in
piling
and
beating
snow
against
the
outer
frame
and
now
it
was
that
trafford
talked
at
last
talked
with
something
of
the
persistence
of
delirium
and
she
sat
and
listened
hour
by
hour
silently
for
he
gave
no
heed
to
her
or
to
anything
she
might
say
he
talked
it
seemed
to
god
darkness
about
a
sullen
glow
of
red
and
a
voice
speaking
the
voice
of
a
man
fevered
and
in
pain
wounded
and
amidst
hardship
and
danger
struggling
with
the
unrelenting
riddle
of
his
being
ever
and
again
when
a
flame
leapt
she
would
see
his
face
haggard
bearded
changed
and
yet
infinitely
familiar
his
voice
varied
now
high
and
clear
now
mumbling
now
vexed
and
expostulating
now
rich
with
deep
feeling
now
fagged
and
slow
his
matter
varied
too
now
he
talked
like
one
who
is
inspired
and
now
like
one
lost
and
confused
stupidly
repeating
phrases
going
back
upon
a
misleading
argument
painfully
laboriously
beginning
over
and
over
again
marjorie
sat
before
the
stove
watching
it
burn
and
sink
replenishing
it
preparing
food
and
outside
the
bitter
wind
moaned
and
blew
the
powdery
snow
before
it
and
the
shortening
interludes
of
pallid
diffused
daylight
which
pass
for
days
in
such
weather
came
and
went
intense
cold
had
come
now
with
leaden
snowy
days
and
starless
nights
sometimes
his
speech
filled
her
mind
seemed
to
fill
all
her
world
sometimes
she
ceased
to
listen
following
thoughts
of
her
own
sometimes
she
dozed
sometimes
she
awakened
from
sleep
to
find
him
talking
but
slowly
she
realized
a
thread
in
his
discourse
a
progress
and
development
sometimes
he
talked
of
his
early
researches
and
then
he
would
trace
computations
with
his
hands
as
if
he
were
using
a
blackboard
and
became
distressed
to
remember
what
he
had
written
sometimes
he
would
be
under
the
claws
of
the
lynx
again
and
fighting
for
his
eyes
ugh
he
said
keep
those
hind
legs
still
keep
your
hind
legs
still
knife
knife
ah
got
it
gu
u
u
you
but
the
gist
of
his
speech
was
determined
by
the
purpose
of
his
journey
to
labrador
at
last
he
was
reviewing
his
life
and
hers
and
all
that
their
life
might
signify
even
as
he
determined
to
do
she
began
to
perceive
that
whatever
else
drifted
into
his
mind
and
talk
this
recurred
and
grew
that
he
returned
to
the
conclusion
he
had
reached
and
not
to
the
beginning
of
the
matter
and
went
on
from
that
you
see
he
said
our
lives
are
nothing
nothing
in
themselves
i
know
that
i
never
had
any
doubts
of
that
we
individuals
just
pick
up
a
mixed
lot
of
things
out
of
the
powers
that
begat
us
and
lay
them
down
again
presently
a
little
altered
that
all
heredities
traditions
the
finger
nails
of
my
grandfather
a
lips
the
faith
of
a
sect
the
ideas
of
one
time
we
live
and
then
we
die
and
the
threads
run
dispersing
this
way
and
that
to
make
other
people
again
whatever
immortal
is
that
our
looks
or
our
habits
our
thoughts
or
our
memories
just
the
shapes
these
are
of
one
immortal
stuff
one
immortal
the
voice
died
away
as
if
he
was
baffled
then
it
resumed
but
we
ought
to
of
immortality
that
my
point
we
ought
to
partake
of
immortality
i
mean
we
like
the
little
elements
in
a
magnet
ought
not
to
lie
ought
to
point
the
same
way
bepolarized
something
microcosmic
you
know
ought
to
be
found
in
a
man
analogies
run
away
with
one
suppose
the
bar
is
magnetized
yet
suppose
purpose
has
to
come
suppose
the
immortal
stuff
is
yet
being
but
struggling
to
be
struggling
to
be
gods
that
morning
when
the
child
was
born
and
afterwards
she
was
there
with
a
smile
on
her
lips
and
a
little
flushed
and
proud
as
if
nothing
had
happened
so
very
much
out
of
the
way
nothing
so
wonderful
and
we
had
another
life
besides
our
own
afterwards
he
came
back
to
that
that
was
a
good
image
he
said
something
trying
to
exist
which
is
substance
does
belong
to
space
or
time
something
stifled
and
enclosed
struggling
to
get
through
just
confused
birth
cries
eyes
that
hardly
see
deaf
ears
poor
little
thrusting
hands
a
thing
altogether
blind
at
first
a
twitching
and
thrusting
of
protoplasm
under
the
waters
and
then
the
plants
creeping
up
the
beaches
the
insects
and
reptiles
on
the
margins
of
the
rivers
beasts
with
a
flicker
of
light
in
their
eyes
answering
the
sun
and
at
last
out
of
the
long
interplay
of
desire
and
fear
an
ape
an
ape
that
stared
and
wondered
and
scratched
queer
pictures
on
a
bone
he
lapsed
into
silent
thought
for
a
time
and
marjorie
glanced
at
his
dim
face
in
the
shadows
i
say
nothing
of
ultimates
he
said
at
last
he
repeated
that
twice
before
his
thoughts
would
flow
again
this
is
as
much
as
i
see
in
time
as
i
know
it
and
space
as
i
know
it
struggling
to
it
true
to
the
end
of
my
limits
what
can
i
say
beyond
that
it
struggles
to
exist
becomes
conscious
becomes
now
conscious
of
itself
that
is
where
i
come
in
as
a
part
of
it
above
the
beast
in
me
is
that
the
desire
to
know
better
to
know
beautifully
and
to
transmit
my
knowledge
that
all
there
is
in
life
for
me
beyond
food
and
shelter
and
tidying
up
this
being
opening
its
eyes
listening
trying
to
comprehend
every
good
thing
in
man
is
that
looking
and
making
pictures
listening
and
making
songs
making
philosophies
and
sciences
trying
new
powers
bridge
and
engine
spark
and
gun
at
the
bottom
of
my
soul
we
began
with
we
still
near
it
i
am
just
a
part
of
this
beginning
mixed
with
other
things
every
book
every
art
every
religion
is
that
the
attempt
to
understand
and
express
mixed
with
other
things
nothing
else
matters
nothing
whatever
i
tell
you
nothing
whatever
i
always
believed
that
all
my
life
i
believed
that
only
i
forgotten
every
man
with
any
brains
believes
that
at
the
bottom
of
his
heart
only
he
gets
busy
and
forgets
he
goes
shooting
lynxes
and
breaks
his
leg
odd
instinctive
brutal
thing
to
do
to
go
tracking
down
a
lynx
to
kill
it
i
grant
you
that
marjorie
i
grant
you
that
grant
me
what
she
cried
startled
beyond
measure
to
hear
herself
addressed
grant
you
that
it
is
rather
absurd
to
go
hunting
a
lynx
and
what
big
paws
it
has
disproportionately
big
i
wonder
if
that
an
adaptation
to
snow
tremendous
paws
they
are
but
the
real
thing
i
was
saying
the
real
thing
is
to
get
knowledge
and
express
it
all
things
lead
up
to
that
civilization
social
order
just
for
that
except
for
that
all
the
life
of
man
all
his
affairs
his
laws
and
police
his
morals
and
manners
nonsense
nonsense
nonsense
lynx
hunts
just
ways
of
getting
themselves
mauled
and
clawed
perhaps
into
a
state
of
understanding
who
knows
his
voice
became
low
and
clear
understanding
spreading
like
a
dawn
logic
and
language
clumsy
implements
but
rising
to
our
needs
rising
to
our
needs
thought
clarified
enriched
reaching
out
to
every
man
alive
some
day
presently
touching
every
man
alive
harmonizing
acts
and
plans
drawing
men
into
gigantic
tremendous
until
man
shall
stand
upon
this
earth
as
upon
a
footstool
and
reach
out
his
hand
among
the
stars
and
then
i
went
into
the
rubber
market
and
spent
seven
years
of
my
life
driving
shares
up
and
down
and
into
a
net
queer
game
indeed
stupid
ass
behrens
was
at
bottom
there
a
flaw
in
it
somewhere
he
came
back
to
that
several
times
before
he
seemed
able
to
go
on
from
it
there
a
collective
mind
he
said
a
growing
general
consciousness
growing
clearer
something
put
me
away
from
that
but
i
know
it
my
work
my
thinking
was
a
part
of
it
that
why
i
was
so
mad
about
behrens
behrens
of
course
he
got
a
twist
a
wrong
twist
it
makes
me
angry
now
it
will
take
years
it
will
eat
up
some
brilliant
man
to
clean
up
after
behrens
yes
but
the
point
is
his
voice
became
acute
why
did
i
go
making
money
and
let
behrens
in
why
generally
and
in
all
sorts
of
things
does
behrens
come
in
he
was
silent
for
a
long
time
and
then
he
began
to
answer
himself
of
course
he
said
i
said
it
or
somebody
said
it
about
this
collective
mind
being
mixed
with
other
things
it
something
arising
out
of
life
not
the
common
stuff
of
life
an
exhalation
it
like
the
little
tongues
of
fire
that
came
at
pentecost
queer
how
one
comes
drifting
back
to
these
images
perhaps
i
shall
die
a
christian
yet
the
other
christians
wo
like
me
if
i
do
what
was
i
saying
what
i
reach
up
to
what
i
desire
shall
pervade
me
not
what
i
am
just
as
far
as
i
give
myself
purely
to
knowledge
to
making
feeling
and
thought
clear
in
my
mind
and
words
to
the
understanding
and
expression
of
the
realities
and
relations
of
life
just
so
far
do
i
achieve
salvation
salvation
i
wonder
is
salvation
the
same
for
every
one
perhaps
for
one
man
salvation
is
research
and
thought
and
for
another
expression
in
art
and
for
another
nursing
lepers
provided
he
does
it
in
the
spirit
he
has
to
do
it
in
the
spirit
there
came
a
silence
as
though
some
difficulty
baffled
him
and
he
was
feeling
back
to
get
his
argument
again
this
flame
that
arises
out
of
life
that
redeems
life
from
purposeless
triviality
life
let
me
get
hold
of
that
that
a
point
that
a
very
important
point
something
had
come
to
him
i
never
talked
of
this
to
marjorie
i
lived
with
her
nine
years
and
more
and
never
talked
of
religion
not
once
that
so
queer
of
us
any
other
couple
in
any
other
time
would
have
talked
religion
no
end
people
ought
to
then
he
stuck
out
an
argumentative
hand
you
see
marjorie
life
he
said
she
took
me
he
spoke
slowly
as
though
he
traced
things
carefully
before
i
met
her
i
suppose
i
was
half
alive
no
yet
i
do
remember
i
felt
particularly
incomplete
women
were
interesting
of
course
they
excited
me
at
times
that
girl
at
yonkers
h
i
stuck
to
my
work
it
was
fine
work
i
forget
half
of
it
now
the
intimations
i
mean
queer
how
one
forgets
but
i
know
i
felt
my
way
to
wide
deep
things
it
was
like
exploring
caves
monstrous
limitless
caves
such
caves
very
still
underground
wonderful
and
beautiful
lying
there
now
for
other
men
to
seek
other
men
will
find
them
then
came
as
though
she
was
taking
possession
the
beauty
of
her
oh
the
life
and
bright
eagerness
and
the
incompatibility
that
the
riddle
i
loved
her
always
when
she
came
to
my
arms
it
seemed
to
me
the
crown
of
life
caves
indeed
old
caves
nothing
else
seemed
to
matter
but
something
did
all
sorts
of
things
did
i
found
that
out
soon
enough
and
when
that
first
child
was
born
that
for
a
time
was
supreme
yes
she
the
quintessence
of
life
the
dear
greed
of
her
the
appetite
the
clever
appetite
for
things
she
grabs
she
so
damned
clever
the
light
in
her
eyes
her
quick
sure
hands
only
my
work
was
crowded
out
of
my
life
and
ended
and
she
did
seem
to
feel
it
she
did
seem
to
mind
it
there
was
a
sort
of
disregard
disregard
as
though
all
that
did
really
matter
dear
whispered
marjorie
unheeded
she
wanted
to
tell
him
it
mattered
now
mattered
supremely
but
she
knew
he
had
no
ears
for
her
his
voice
flattened
it
perplexing
he
said
the
two
different
things
then
suddenly
he
cried
out
harshly
i
ought
never
to
have
married
her
never
never
i
had
my
task
i
gave
myself
to
her
oh
the
high
immensities
the
great
and
terrible
things
open
to
the
mind
of
man
and
we
breed
children
and
live
in
littered
houses
and
play
with
our
food
and
chatter
chatter
chatter
oh
the
chatter
of
my
life
the
folly
the
women
with
their
clothes
i
can
hear
them
rustle
now
whiff
the
scent
of
it
the
scandals
as
though
the
things
they
did
with
themselves
and
each
other
mattered
a
rap
the
little
sham
impromptu
clever
things
the
trying
to
keep
young
and
underneath
it
all
that
continual
cheating
cheating
cheating
damning
struggle
for
money
marjorie
marjorie
marjorie
why
is
she
so
good
and
no
better
why
was
she
worth
it
altogether
no
i
do
want
to
go
on
with
it
any
more
ever
i
want
to
go
back
i
want
my
life
over
again
and
to
go
back
i
want
research
and
the
spirit
of
research
that
has
died
in
me
and
that
still
silent
room
of
mine
again
that
room
as
quiet
as
a
cell
and
the
toil
that
led
to
light
oh
the
coming
of
that
light
the
uprush
of
discovery
the
solemn
joy
as
the
generalization
rises
like
a
sun
upon
the
facts
floods
them
with
a
common
meaning
that
is
what
i
want
that
is
what
i
have
always
wanted
give
me
my
time
oh
god
again
i
am
sick
of
this
life
i
have
chosen
i
am
sick
of
it
this
busy
death
give
me
my
time
again
why
did
you
make
me
and
then
waste
me
like
this
why
are
we
made
for
folly
upon
folly
folly
and
brains
made
to
scale
high
heaven
smeared
into
the
dust
into
the
dust
into
the
dust
dust
he
passed
into
weak
wandering
repetitions
of
disconnected
sentences
that
died
into
whispers
and
silence
and
marjorie
watched
him
and
listened
to
him
and
waited
with
a
noiseless
dexterity
upon
his
every
need
one
day
she
did
not
know
what
day
for
she
had
lost
count
of
the
days
marjorie
set
the
kettle
to
boil
and
opened
the
door
of
the
hut
to
look
out
and
the
snow
was
ablaze
with
diamonds
and
the
air
was
sweet
and
still
it
occurred
to
her
that
it
would
be
well
to
take
trafford
out
into
that
brief
brightness
she
looked
at
him
and
found
his
eyes
upon
the
sunlight
quiet
and
rather
wondering
eyes
would
you
like
to
get
out
into
that
she
asked
abruptly
yes
he
said
and
seemed
disposed
to
get
up
you
got
a
broken
leg
she
cried
to
arrest
his
movement
and
he
looked
at
her
and
answered
of
course
i
forgot
she
was
all
atremble
that
he
should
recognize
her
and
speak
to
her
she
pulled
her
rude
old
sledge
alongside
his
bunk
and
kissed
him
and
showed
him
how
to
shift
and
drop
himself
upon
the
plank
she
took
him
in
her
arms
and
lowered
him
he
helped
weakly
but
understandingly
and
she
wrapped
him
up
warmly
on
the
planks
and
lugged
him
out
and
built
up
a
big
fire
at
his
feet
wondering
but
as
yet
too
fearful
to
rejoice
at
the
change
that
had
come
to
him
he
said
no
more
but
his
eyes
watched
her
move
about
with
a
kind
of
tired
curiosity
he
smiled
for
a
time
at
the
sun
and
shut
his
eyes
and
still
faintly
smiling
lay
still
she
had
a
curious
fear
that
if
she
tried
to
talk
to
him
this
new
lucidity
would
vanish
again
she
went
about
the
business
of
the
morning
glancing
at
him
ever
and
again
until
suddenly
the
calm
of
his
upturned
face
smote
her
and
she
ran
to
him
and
crouched
down
to
him
between
hope
and
a
terrible
fear
and
found
that
he
was
sleeping
and
breathing
very
lightly
sleeping
with
the
deep
unconsciousness
of
a
child
when
he
awakened
the
sun
was
red
in
the
west
his
eyes
met
hers
and
he
seemed
a
little
puzzled
i
been
sleeping
madge
he
said
she
nodded
and
dreaming
i
a
vague
sort
of
memory
of
preaching
and
preaching
in
a
kind
of
black
empty
place
where
there
was
anything
a
fury
of
exposition
a
kind
of
argument
i
say
is
there
such
a
thing
in
the
world
as
a
egg
and
some
he
seemed
to
reflect
of
course
he
said
i
broke
my
leg
gollys
i
thought
that
beast
was
going
to
claw
my
eyes
out
lucky
madge
it
did
get
my
eyes
it
was
just
a
chance
it
did
he
stared
at
her
i
say
he
said
you
had
a
pretty
rough
time
how
long
has
this
been
going
on
he
amazed
her
by
rising
himself
on
his
elbow
and
sitting
up
your
leg
she
cried
he
put
his
hand
down
and
felt
it
pretty
stiff
he
said
you
get
me
some
food
there
some
eggs
madge
frozen
anyhow
and
then
we
take
these
splints
off
and
feel
about
a
bit
eh
why
not
how
did
you
get
me
out
of
that
scrape
madge
i
thought
i
got
to
be
froze
as
safe
as
eggs
those
eggs
ought
to
be
all
right
you
know
if
you
put
them
on
in
a
saucepan
and
wait
until
they
boil
i
a
sort
of
muddled
impression
by
jove
madge
you
had
a
time
i
say
you
had
a
time
his
eyes
full
of
a
warmth
of
kindliness
she
had
not
seen
for
long
weeks
scrutinized
her
face
i
say
he
repeated
very
softly
all
her
strength
went
from
her
at
his
tenderness
oh
my
dear
she
wailed
kneeling
at
his
side
my
dear
dear
and
still
regardful
of
his
leg
she
yet
contrived
to
get
herself
weeping
into
his
coveted
arms
he
regarded
her
he
held
her
he
patted
her
back
the
infinite
luxury
to
her
he
come
back
he
come
back
to
her
how
long
has
it
been
he
asked
poor
dear
poor
dear
how
long
can
it
have
been
from
that
hour
trafford
mended
he
remained
helpful
sustaining
his
face
healed
daily
marjorie
had
had
to
cut
away
great
fragments
of
gangrenous
frozen
flesh
and
he
was
clearly
destined
to
have
a
huge
scar
over
forehead
and
cheek
but
in
that
pure
clear
air
once
the
healing
had
begun
it
progressed
swiftly
his
leg
had
set
a
little
shorter
than
its
fellow
and
with
a
lump
in
the
middle
of
the
shin
but
it
promised
to
be
a
good
serviceable
leg
none
the
less
they
examined
it
by
the
light
of
the
stove
with
their
heads
together
and
discussed
when
it
would
be
wise
to
try
it
how
do
doctors
tell
when
a
man
may
stand
on
his
broken
leg
she
had
a
vague
impression
you
must
wait
six
weeks
but
she
could
not
remember
why
she
fixed
upon
that
time
it
seems
a
decent
interval
said
trafford
we
try
it
she
had
contrived
a
crutch
for
him
against
that
momentous
experiment
and
he
sat
up
in
his
bunk
pillowed
up
by
a
sack
and
her
rugs
and
whittled
it
smooth
and
padded
the
fork
with
the
skin
of
that
slaughtered
wolverine
poor
victim
of
hunger
while
she
knelt
by
the
stove
feeding
it
with
logs
and
gave
him
an
account
of
their
position
we
somewhere
in
the
middle
of
december
she
said
somewhere
between
the
twelfth
and
the
fourteenth
yes
i
as
out
as
that
and
i
handled
the
stores
pretty
freely
so
did
that
little
beast
until
i
got
him
she
nodded
at
the
skin
in
his
hand
i
do
see
myself
shooting
much
now
and
so
far
i
not
been
able
to
break
the
ice
to
fish
it
too
much
for
me
even
if
it
is
too
late
to
fish
this
book
we
got
describes
barks
and
mosses
and
that
will
help
but
if
we
stick
here
until
the
birds
and
things
come
we
going
to
be
precious
short
we
may
have
to
last
right
into
july
i
plans
but
it
may
come
to
that
we
ought
to
ration
all
the
regular
stuff
and
trust
to
luck
for
a
feast
the
rations
i
do
know
what
they
come
to
right
o
said
trafford
admiring
her
capable
gravity
let
ration
marjorie
he
asked
abruptly
are
you
sorry
we
came
her
answer
came
unhesitatingly
nor
i
he
paused
i
found
you
out
he
said
dear
dirty
living
thing
you
dirty
you
know
i
found
myself
she
answered
thinking
i
feel
as
if
i
never
loved
you
until
this
hut
i
suppose
i
have
in
my
way
lugano
he
suggested
do
let
forget
good
things
marjorie
oh
and
endless
times
oh
of
course
as
for
but
now
now
you
in
my
bones
we
were
just
two
shallow
pretty
young
things
loving
it
was
sweet
dear
sweet
as
youth
but
not
this
unkempt
and
weary
then
one
understands
love
i
suppose
i
dirty
think
of
it
i
lugged
you
through
the
snow
till
my
shoulders
chafed
and
bled
i
cried
with
pain
and
kept
on
lugging
oh
my
dear
my
dear
he
kissed
her
hair
held
you
in
my
arms
to
keep
you
from
freezing
i
have
frozen
myself
first
we
got
to
starve
together
perhaps
before
the
end
dear
if
i
could
make
you
you
should
eat
me
i
i
beginning
to
understand
i
had
a
light
i
begun
to
understand
i
begun
to
see
what
life
has
been
for
you
and
how
i
wasted
wasted
wasted
no
she
said
it
was
i
she
sat
back
on
the
floor
and
regarded
him
you
do
remember
things
you
said
when
you
were
delirious
no
he
answered
what
did
i
say
nothing
nothing
clearly
what
did
i
say
it
does
matter
no
indeed
only
you
made
me
understand
you
never
have
told
me
you
always
been
a
little
weak
with
me
there
but
plain
to
me
why
we
did
keep
our
happiness
why
we
were
estranged
if
we
go
back
alive
we
go
back
all
that
settled
for
good
and
all
what
that
discord
my
dear
i
been
a
fool
selfish
and
greedy
we
both
been
floundering
about
but
i
been
the
mischief
of
it
yes
i
been
the
trouble
oh
it
had
to
be
so
what
are
we
women
half
savages
half
pets
unemployed
things
of
greed
and
desire
and
suddenly
we
want
all
the
rights
and
respect
of
souls
had
your
life
in
my
hands
from
the
moment
we
met
together
if
i
had
known
it
is
that
we
can
make
you
or
guide
you
i
not
pretending
to
be
an
inspiration
but
but
we
can
release
you
we
need
press
upon
you
we
can
save
you
from
the
instincts
and
passions
that
try
to
waste
you
altogether
on
us
yes
i
beginning
to
understand
oh
my
child
my
husband
my
man
you
talked
of
your
wasted
life
i
been
thinking
since
first
we
left
the
mersey
i
begun
to
see
what
it
is
to
be
a
woman
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
we
the
responsible
sex
and
we
forgotten
it
we
think
we
done
a
wonder
if
we
borne
men
into
the
world
and
smiled
a
little
but
indeed
we
got
to
bear
them
all
our
lives
a
woman
has
to
be
steadier
than
a
man
and
more
than
a
man
because
when
she
plunges
she
does
more
harm
than
a
man
and
what
does
she
achieve
if
she
does
plunge
nothing
nothing
worth
counting
dresses
and
carpets
and
hangings
and
pretty
arrangements
excitements
and
satisfactions
and
competition
and
more
excitements
we
ca
things
we
do
bring
things
off
and
you
you
monster
you
dream
you
want
to
stick
your
hand
out
of
all
that
is
and
make
something
that
is
begin
to
be
that
the
man
dear
old
madge
he
said
there
all
sorts
of
women
and
all
sorts
of
men
well
our
sort
of
women
then
and
our
sort
of
men
i
doubt
even
that
i
do
i
found
my
place
i
been
making
my
master
my
servant
we
women
we
been
looting
all
the
good
things
in
the
world
and
helping
nothing
you
carried
me
on
your
back
until
you
are
loathing
life
i
been
making
you
fetch
and
carry
for
me
love
me
dress
me
keep
me
and
my
children
minister
to
my
vanities
and
greeds
no
let
me
go
on
i
so
penitent
my
dear
so
penitent
i
want
to
kneel
down
here
and
marry
you
all
over
again
heal
up
your
broken
life
and
begin
she
paused
one
does
begin
again
she
said
but
i
want
to
take
a
new
turn
dear
you
still
only
a
young
man
we
thirty
or
forty
years
before
us
forty
years
perhaps
or
more
what
shall
we
do
with
our
years
we
loved
we
got
children
what
remains
here
we
can
plan
it
out
work
it
out
day
after
day
what
shall
we
do
with
our
lives
and
life
tell
me
make
me
your
partner
it
you
who
know
what
are
we
doing
with
life
what
are
we
doing
with
life
that
question
overtakes
a
reluctant
and
fugitive
humanity
the
traffords
were
but
two
of
a
great
scattered
host
of
people
who
obeying
all
the
urgencies
of
need
and
desire
struggling
loving
begetting
enjoying
do
nevertheless
find
themselves
at
last
unsatisfied
they
have
lived
the
round
of
experience
achieved
all
that
living
creatures
have
sought
since
the
beginning
of
the
world
security
and
gratification
and
offspring
and
they
find
themselves
still
strong
unsatiated
with
power
in
their
hands
and
years
before
them
empty
of
purpose
what
are
they
to
do
the
world
presents
such
a
spectacle
of
evasion
as
it
has
never
seen
before
never
was
there
such
a
boiling
over
and
waste
of
vital
energy
the
sphinx
of
our
opportunity
calls
for
the
uttermost
powers
of
heart
and
brain
to
read
its
riddle
the
new
astonishing
riddle
of
excessive
power
a
few
give
themselves
to
those
honourable
adventures
that
extend
the
range
of
man
they
explore
untravelled
countries
climb
remote
mountains
conduct
researches
risk
life
and
limb
in
the
fantastic
experiments
of
flight
and
a
monstrous
outpouring
of
labour
and
material
goes
on
in
the
strenuous
preparation
for
needless
and
improbable
wars
the
rest
divert
themselves
with
the
dwarfish
satisfactions
of
recognized
vice
the
meagre
routine
of
pleasure
or
still
more
timidly
with
sport
and
games
those
new
unscheduled
perversions
of
the
soul
we
are
afraid
of
our
new
selves
the
dawn
of
human
opportunity
appals
us
few
of
us
dare
look
upon
this
strange
light
of
freedom
and
limitless
resources
that
breaks
upon
our
world
think
said
trafford
while
we
sit
here
in
this
dark
hut
think
of
the
surplus
life
that
wastes
itself
in
the
world
for
sheer
lack
of
direction
away
there
in
england
i
suppose
that
is
westward
he
pointed
there
are
thousands
of
men
going
out
to
shoot
think
of
the
beautifully
made
guns
the
perfected
ammunition
the
excellent
clothes
the
army
of
beaters
the
carefully
preserved
woodland
the
admirable
science
of
it
all
for
that
idiot
massacre
of
birds
just
because
man
once
had
need
to
be
a
hunter
think
of
the
others
again
golfing
think
of
the
big
elaborate
houses
from
which
they
come
the
furnishings
the
service
and
the
women
dressing
perpetually
dressing
marjorie
you
done
nothing
but
dress
since
we
married
no
let
me
abuse
you
dear
it
insane
you
know
you
dress
your
minds
a
little
to
talk
amusingly
you
spread
your
minds
out
to
backgrounds
to
households
picturesque
and
delightful
gardens
nurseries
those
nurseries
think
of
our
tremendously
cherished
and
educated
children
and
when
they
grow
up
what
have
we
got
for
them
a
feast
of
futility
on
the
evening
of
the
day
when
trafford
first
tried
to
stand
upon
his
leg
they
talked
far
into
the
night
it
had
been
a
great
and
eventful
day
for
them
full
of
laughter
and
exultation
he
had
been
at
first
ridiculously
afraid
he
had
clung
to
her
almost
childishly
and
she
had
held
him
about
the
body
with
his
weight
on
her
strong
right
arm
and
his
right
arm
in
her
left
hand
concealing
her
own
dread
of
a
collapse
under
a
mask
of
taunting
courage
the
crutch
had
proved
admirable
it
my
silly
knees
trafford
kept
on
saying
the
leg
all
right
but
i
get
put
out
by
my
silly
knees
they
made
the
day
a
feast
a
dinner
of
two
whole
day
rations
and
a
special
soup
instead
of
supper
the
birds
will
come
they
explained
to
each
other
ducks
and
geese
long
before
may
may
you
know
is
the
latest
marjorie
confessed
the
habit
of
sharing
his
pipe
was
growing
on
her
what
shall
we
do
in
tyburnia
she
said
and
left
it
to
the
imagination
if
ever
we
get
back
there
he
said
i
do
much
fancy
kicking
a
skirt
before
my
shins
again
and
i
be
a
black
coarse
woman
down
to
my
neck
at
dinner
for
years
to
come
then
as
he
lay
back
in
his
bunk
and
she
crammed
the
stove
with
fresh
boughs
and
twigs
of
balsam
that
filled
the
little
space
about
them
with
warmth
and
with
a
faint
sweet
smell
of
burning
and
with
flitting
red
reflections
he
took
up
a
talk
about
religion
they
had
begun
some
days
before
you
see
he
said
i
always
believed
in
salvation
i
suppose
a
man
shy
of
saying
so
even
to
his
wife
but
i
always
believed
more
or
less
distinctly
that
there
was
something
up
to
which
a
life
worked
always
it
been
rather
vague
i
admit
i
do
think
ever
believed
in
individual
salvation
you
see
i
feel
these
are
deep
things
and
the
deeper
one
gets
the
less
individual
one
becomes
why
one
thinks
of
those
things
in
darkness
and
loneliness
and
finds
them
hard
to
tell
one
has
an
individual
voice
or
an
individual
birthmark
or
an
individualized
old
hat
but
the
soul
the
different
it
is
me
talking
to
you
when
it
comes
to
that
this
question
of
what
we
are
doing
with
life
is
a
question
to
begin
with
for
you
and
me
as
ourselves
but
for
you
and
me
as
mankind
am
i
spinning
it
too
fine
madge
no
she
said
intent
go
on
you
see
when
we
talk
rations
here
marjorie
it
ourselves
but
when
we
talk
religion
it
mankind
you
either
got
to
be
everyman
in
religion
or
leave
it
alone
that
my
idea
it
no
more
presumptuous
to
think
for
the
race
than
it
is
for
a
beggar
to
pray
though
that
means
going
right
up
to
god
and
talking
to
him
salvation
a
collective
thing
and
a
mystical
thing
or
there
is
any
fancy
the
almighty
and
me
sitting
up
and
keeping
eternity
together
god
and
trafford
that
silly
fancy
a
man
in
number
seven
boots
and
a
suit
in
the
fashion
sitting
before
god
that
caricature
but
god
and
man
that
sense
he
stopped
and
stared
at
her
marjorie
sat
regarding
him
queer
things
you
say
she
said
so
much
of
this
i
never
thought
out
i
wonder
why
i
never
done
so
too
busy
with
many
things
i
suppose
but
go
on
and
tell
me
more
of
these
secrets
you
kept
from
me
well
we
got
to
talk
of
these
things
as
mankind
or
just
leave
them
alone
and
shoot
if
i
could
shoot
a
pheasant
now
whispered
marjorie
involuntarily
and
where
do
we
stand
what
do
we
need
i
mean
the
whole
race
of
us
kings
and
beggars
together
you
know
marjorie
it
this
understanding
that
what
mankind
has
got
to
the
realization
that
it
does
understand
that
it
ca
express
that
it
purblind
we
have
got
eyes
for
those
greater
things
but
we
got
the
promise
the
intimation
of
eyes
we
come
out
of
an
unsuspecting
darkness
brute
animal
darkness
not
into
sight
that
been
the
mistake
but
into
a
feeling
of
illumination
into
a
feeling
of
light
shining
through
our
opacity
i
feel
that
man
has
now
before
all
things
to
know
that
his
supreme
duty
to
feel
realize
see
understand
express
himself
to
the
utmost
limits
of
his
power
he
sat
up
speaking
very
earnestly
to
her
and
in
that
flickering
light
she
realized
for
the
first
time
how
thin
he
had
become
how
bright
and
hollow
his
eyes
his
hair
was
long
over
his
eyes
and
a
rough
beard
flowed
down
to
his
chest
all
the
religions
he
said
all
the
philosophies
have
pretended
to
achieve
too
much
we
no
language
yet
for
religious
truth
or
metaphysical
truth
we
no
basis
yet
broad
enough
and
strong
enough
on
which
to
build
religion
and
philosophy
have
been
impudent
and
quackish
quackish
they
been
like
the
doctors
who
have
always
pretended
they
could
cure
since
the
beginning
of
things
cure
everything
and
to
this
day
even
they
have
got
more
than
the
beginnings
of
knowledge
on
which
to
base
a
cure
they
lacked
humility
they
lacked
the
honour
to
say
they
did
know
the
priests
took
things
of
wood
and
stone
the
philosophers
took
little
odd
arrangements
of
poor
battered
words
metaphors
analogies
abstractions
and
said
that
it
think
of
their
silly
old
absolute
an
untied
parcel
i
heard
haldane
at
the
aristotelian
once
go
on
for
an
hour
no
it
was
longer
than
an
hour
as
glib
and
slick
as
a
about
the
different
sorts
of
absolute
and
not
a
soul
of
us
laughed
out
at
him
the
vanity
of
such
profundities
they
no
faith
faith
in
patience
faith
to
wait
for
the
coming
of
god
and
since
we
do
know
god
since
we
do
know
his
will
with
us
is
it
plain
that
all
our
lives
should
be
a
search
for
him
and
it
can
anything
else
matter
after
we
are
free
from
necessity
that
is
the
work
now
that
is
before
all
mankind
to
attempt
understanding
by
the
perpetual
finding
of
thought
and
the
means
of
expression
by
perpetual
extension
and
refinement
of
science
by
the
research
that
every
artist
makes
for
beauty
and
significance
in
his
art
by
the
perpetual
testing
and
destruction
and
rebirth
under
criticism
of
all
these
things
and
by
a
perpetual
extension
of
this
intensifying
wisdom
to
more
minds
and
more
minds
and
more
till
all
men
share
in
it
and
share
in
the
making
of
it
there
you
have
my
creed
marjorie
there
you
have
the
very
marrow
of
he
became
silent
will
you
go
back
to
your
work
she
said
abruptly
go
back
to
your
laboratory
he
stared
at
her
for
a
moment
without
speaking
never
he
said
at
last
but
she
said
and
the
word
dropped
from
her
like
a
stone
that
falls
down
a
well
my
dear
he
said
at
last
i
thought
of
that
but
since
i
left
that
dear
dusty
little
laboratory
and
all
those
exquisite
subtle
things
i
lived
i
left
that
man
seven
long
years
behind
me
some
other
man
must
go
on
i
think
some
younger
man
with
the
riddles
i
found
to
work
on
then
i
grown
into
something
different
it
is
how
atoms
swing
with
one
another
or
why
they
build
themselves
up
so
and
not
so
that
matters
any
more
to
me
i
got
you
and
all
the
world
in
which
we
live
and
a
new
set
of
riddles
filling
my
mind
how
thought
swings
about
thought
how
one
man
attracts
his
fellows
how
the
waves
of
motive
and
conviction
sweep
through
a
crowd
and
all
the
little
drifting
crystallizations
of
spirit
with
spirit
and
all
the
repulsions
and
eddies
and
difficulties
that
one
can
catch
in
that
turbulent
confusion
i
want
to
do
a
new
sort
of
work
now
altogether
life
has
swamped
me
once
but
i
do
think
it
will
get
me
under
again
i
want
to
study
men
he
paused
and
she
waited
with
a
face
aglow
i
want
to
go
back
to
watch
and
think
and
i
suppose
write
i
believe
i
shall
write
criticism
but
everything
that
matters
is
criticism
i
want
to
get
into
contact
with
the
men
who
are
thinking
i
do
mean
to
meet
them
necessarily
but
to
get
into
the
souls
of
their
books
every
writer
who
has
anything
to
say
every
artist
who
matters
is
the
stronger
for
every
man
or
woman
who
responds
to
him
that
the
great
work
the
reality
i
want
to
become
a
part
of
this
stuttering
attempt
to
express
i
want
at
least
to
resonate
even
if
i
do
not
help
and
you
with
me
marjorie
you
with
me
everything
i
write
i
want
you
to
see
and
think
about
i
want
you
to
read
as
i
read
now
after
so
long
now
that
now
that
we
begun
to
talk
you
know
talk
again
something
stopped
his
voice
something
choked
them
both
into
silence
he
held
out
a
lean
hand
and
she
shuffled
on
her
knees
to
take
it
do
please
make
me
she
stumbled
through
her
thoughts
one
of
those
little
parasitic
parroting
wives
do
pretend
too
much
about
me
because
you
want
me
with
you
do
forget
a
woman
is
a
man
old
madge
he
said
you
and
i
have
got
to
march
together
did
i
love
you
from
the
first
from
that
time
when
i
was
a
boy
examiner
and
you
were
a
candidate
girl
because
your
mind
was
clear
and
we
will
go
back
she
whispered
with
a
work
with
a
purpose
he
said
she
disengaged
herself
from
his
arm
and
sat
close
to
him
upon
the
floor
i
think
i
can
see
what
you
will
do
she
said
she
mused
for
the
first
time
i
begin
to
see
things
as
they
may
be
for
us
i
begin
to
see
a
life
ahead
for
the
very
first
time
queer
ideas
came
drifting
into
her
head
suddenly
she
cried
out
sharply
in
that
high
note
he
loved
good
heavens
she
said
the
absurdity
the
infinite
absurdity
but
what
i
might
have
married
will
magnet
that
all
she
sprang
to
her
feet
there
came
a
sound
of
wind
outside
a
shifting
of
snow
on
the
roof
and
the
door
creaked
eleven
she
exclaimed
looking
at
the
watch
that
hung
in
the
light
of
the
stove
door
i
do
want
to
sleep
yet
do
you
i
going
to
brew
some
tea
make
a
convivial
drink
and
then
we
will
go
on
talking
it
so
good
talking
to
you
so
good
i
an
idea
do
you
think
on
this
special
day
it
might
run
to
a
biscuit
her
face
was
keenly
anxious
he
nodded
one
biscuit
each
she
said
trying
to
rob
her
voice
of
any
note
of
criminality
just
one
you
know
wo
matter
she
hovered
for
some
moments
close
to
the
stove
before
she
went
into
the
arctic
corner
that
contained
the
tin
of
tea
if
we
can
really
live
like
that
she
said
when
we
are
home
again
why
not
he
answered
she
made
no
answer
but
went
across
for
the
tea
he
turned
his
head
at
the
sound
of
the
biscuit
tin
and
watched
her
put
out
the
precious
discs
i
shall
have
another
pipe
he
proclaimed
with
an
agreeable
note
of
excess
thank
heaven
for
unstinted
tobacco
and
now
marjorie
mind
was
teaming
with
thoughts
of
this
new
conception
of
a
life
lived
for
understanding
as
she
went
about
the
preparation
of
the
tea
her
vividly
concrete
imagination
was
active
with
the
realization
of
the
life
they
would
lead
on
their
return
she
could
not
see
it
otherwise
than
framed
in
a
tall
fine
room
a
study
a
study
in
sombre
tones
with
high
narrow
tall
dignified
bookshelves
and
rich
deep
green
curtains
veiling
its
windows
there
should
be
a
fireplace
of
white
marble
very
plain
and
well
proportioned
with
furnishings
of
old
brass
and
a
big
desk
towards
the
window
beautifully
lit
by
electric
light
with
abundant
space
for
papers
to
lie
and
she
wanted
some
touch
of
the
wilderness
about
it
a
skin
perhaps
the
tea
was
still
infusing
when
she
had
determined
upon
an
enormous
of
that
iridescent
labradorite
that
had
been
so
astonishing
a
feature
of
the
green
river
valley
she
would
have
it
polished
on
one
side
only
the
other
should
be
rough
to
show
the
felspar
in
its
natural
state
it
was
that
she
did
feel
and
understand
quite
fully
the
intention
and
significance
of
all
he
had
said
but
that
in
these
symbols
of
texture
and
equipment
her
mind
quite
naturally
clothed
itself
and
while
this
room
was
coming
into
anticipatory
being
in
her
mind
she
was
making
the
tea
very
deftly
and
listening
to
trafford
every
word
that
talk
marked
an
epoch
to
marjorie
from
that
day
forth
her
imagination
began
to
shape
a
new
ordered
and
purposeful
life
for
trafford
and
herself
in
london
a
life
not
altogether
divorced
from
their
former
life
but
with
a
faith
sustaining
it
and
aims
controlling
it
she
had
always
known
of
the
breadth
and
power
of
his
mind
but
now
as
he
talked
of
what
he
might
do
what
interests
might
converge
and
give
results
through
him
it
seemed
she
really
knew
him
for
the
first
time
in
his
former
researches
so
technical
and
withdrawn
she
had
seen
little
of
his
mind
in
action
now
he
was
dealing
in
his
own
fashion
with
things
she
could
clearly
understand
there
were
times
when
his
talk
affected
her
like
that
joy
of
light
one
has
in
emerging
into
sunshine
from
a
long
and
tedious
cave
he
swept
things
together
flashed
unsuspected
correlations
upon
her
intelligence
smashed
and
scattered
absurd
yet
venerated
conventions
of
thought
made
courses
of
action
visible
in
a
flare
of
luminous
necessity
and
she
could
follow
him
and
help
him
just
as
she
had
hampered
him
and
crippled
him
so
now
she
could
release
him
she
fondled
that
word
she
found
a
preposterous
image
in
her
mind
that
she
hid
like
a
disgraceful
secret
that
she
tried
to
forget
and
yet
its
stupendous
its
dreamlike
absurdity
had
something
in
it
that
shaped
her
delight
as
nothing
else
could
do
she
was
she
told
herself
hawking
with
an
archangel
these
were
her
moods
of
exaltation
and
she
was
sure
she
had
never
loved
her
man
before
that
this
was
indeed
her
beginning
it
was
as
if
she
had
just
found
him
perhaps
she
thought
true
lovers
keep
on
finding
each
other
all
through
their
lives
and
he
too
had
discovered
her
all
the
host
of
marjories
he
had
known
the
shining
delightful
seductive
wilful
perplexing
aspects
that
had
so
filled
her
life
gave
place
altogether
for
a
time
to
this
woman
lean
and
with
the
valiant
heart
and
the
skin
what
a
fine
strong
ruddy
thing
she
was
how
glad
he
was
for
this
wild
adventure
in
the
wilderness
if
only
because
it
had
made
him
lie
among
the
rocks
and
think
of
her
and
wait
for
her
and
despair
of
her
life
and
god
and
at
last
see
her
coming
back
to
him
flushed
with
effort
and
calling
his
name
to
him
out
of
that
whirlwind
of
snow
and
there
was
at
least
one
old
memory
mixed
up
with
all
these
new
and
overmastering
impressions
the
memory
of
her
clear
unhesitating
voice
as
it
had
stabbed
into
his
life
again
long
years
ago
minute
and
bright
in
the
telephone
me
you
know
it
marjorie
perhaps
after
all
she
had
not
wasted
a
moment
of
his
life
perhaps
every
issue
between
them
had
been
necessary
and
it
was
good
altogether
to
be
turned
from
the
study
of
crystals
to
the
study
of
men
and
women
and
now
both
their
minds
were
londonward
where
all
the
tides
and
driftage
and
currents
of
human
thought
still
meet
and
swirl
together
they
were
full
of
what
they
would
do
when
they
got
back
marjorie
sketched
that
study
to
him
in
general
terms
and
without
the
and
began
to
shape
the
world
she
would
have
about
it
she
meant
to
be
his
squaw
and
first
of
all
and
then
a
mother
children
she
said
are
none
the
worse
for
being
kept
a
little
out
of
focus
and
he
was
rapidly
planning
out
his
approach
to
the
new
questions
to
which
he
was
now
to
devote
his
life
one
wants
something
to
hold
the
work
together
he
said
and
projected
a
book
one
can
not
struggle
at
large
for
plain
statement
and
copious
and
free
and
courageous
statement
one
needs
a
positive
attack
he
designed
a
book
which
he
might
write
if
only
for
the
definition
it
would
give
him
and
with
no
ultimate
publication
which
was
to
be
called
the
limits
of
language
as
a
means
of
expression
it
was
to
be
a
pragmatist
essay
a
sustained
attempt
to
undermine
the
confidence
of
all
that
scholasticism
and
logic
chopping
which
still
lingers
like
the
of
a
disease
in
our
university
philosophy
those
duffers
sit
in
their
studies
and
make
a
sort
of
tea
of
dry
old
words
and
think
they
distilling
the
spirit
of
wisdom
he
said
he
proliferated
titles
for
a
time
and
settled
at
last
on
from
realism
to
reality
he
wanted
to
get
at
that
at
once
it
fretted
him
to
have
to
hang
in
the
air
day
by
day
for
want
of
books
to
quote
and
opponents
to
lance
and
confute
and
he
wanted
to
see
pictures
too
and
plays
read
novels
he
had
heard
of
and
never
read
in
order
to
verify
or
correct
the
ideas
that
were
seething
in
his
mind
about
the
qualities
of
artistic
expression
his
thought
had
come
out
to
a
conviction
that
the
line
to
wider
human
understandings
lies
through
a
huge
criticism
and
cleaning
up
of
the
existing
methods
of
formulation
as
a
preliminary
to
the
wider
and
freer
discussion
of
those
religious
and
social
issues
our
generation
still
shrinks
from
it
grotesque
he
said
and
utterly
true
that
the
sanity
and
happiness
of
all
the
world
lies
in
its
habits
of
generalization
there
was
not
even
paper
for
him
to
make
notes
or
provisional
drafts
of
the
new
work
he
hobbled
about
the
camp
fretting
at
these
deprivations
marjorie
he
said
we
done
our
job
why
should
we
wait
here
on
this
frosty
shelf
outside
the
world
my
leg
getting
sounder
if
it
was
for
that
feeling
of
ice
in
it
why
should
we
make
another
sledge
from
the
other
bunk
and
start
down
to
hammond
why
not
but
the
way
the
valley
would
guide
us
we
could
do
four
hours
a
day
before
we
had
to
camp
i
not
sure
we
could
try
the
river
we
could
drag
and
carry
all
our
food
she
looked
down
the
wide
stretches
of
the
valley
there
was
the
hill
they
had
christened
marjorie
ridge
at
least
it
was
familiar
every
night
before
nightfall
if
they
started
there
would
be
a
fresh
camping
place
to
seek
among
the
a
great
heap
of
wood
to
cut
to
last
the
night
suppose
his
leg
gave
out
when
they
were
already
some
days
away
so
that
he
could
no
longer
go
on
or
she
drag
him
back
to
the
stores
plainly
there
would
be
nothing
for
it
then
but
to
lie
down
and
die
together
and
a
sort
of
weariness
had
come
to
her
as
a
consequence
of
two
months
of
days
not
perhaps
a
failure
so
much
as
a
reluctance
of
spirit
of
course
she
said
with
a
new
aspect
drifting
before
her
mind
then
we
eat
we
feed
up
before
we
started
we
could
feast
almost
while
you
were
asleep
the
other
night
trafford
began
one
day
as
they
sat
spinning
out
their
meal
i
was
thinking
how
badly
i
had
expressed
myself
when
i
talked
to
you
the
other
day
and
what
a
queer
thin
affair
i
made
of
the
plans
i
wanted
to
carry
out
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
neither
queer
nor
thin
but
they
are
unreal
in
comparison
with
the
common
things
of
everyday
life
hunger
anger
all
the
immediate
desires
they
must
be
they
only
begin
when
those
others
are
at
peace
it
hard
to
set
out
these
things
they
complicated
and
subtle
and
one
can
not
simplify
without
falsehood
i
do
want
to
simplify
the
world
has
gone
out
of
its
way
time
after
time
through
simplifications
and
short
cuts
save
us
from
epigrams
and
when
one
thinks
over
what
one
has
said
at
a
little
distance
one
wants
to
go
back
to
it
and
say
it
all
again
i
seem
to
be
not
so
much
thinking
things
out
as
reviving
and
developing
things
i
had
growing
in
my
mind
ever
since
we
met
it
as
though
an
immense
reservoir
of
thought
had
filled
up
in
my
mind
at
last
and
was
beginning
to
trickle
over
and
break
down
the
embankment
between
us
this
conflict
that
has
been
going
on
between
our
life
together
and
my
my
intellectual
life
it
only
just
growing
clear
in
my
own
mind
yet
it
just
as
if
one
turned
up
a
light
on
something
that
had
always
been
there
it
a
most
extraordinary
thing
to
think
out
marjorie
that
antagonism
our
love
has
kept
us
so
close
together
and
always
our
purposes
have
been
like
that
he
spread
divergent
hands
speculated
again
and
again
whether
there
is
something
incurably
antagonistic
between
women
that
generalized
marjorie
and
men
that
me
directly
we
pass
beyond
the
conditions
of
the
individualistic
struggle
i
believe
every
couple
of
lovers
who
ever
married
have
felt
that
strain
yet
it
not
a
difference
in
kind
between
us
but
degree
the
big
conflict
between
us
has
a
parallel
in
a
little
internal
conflict
that
goes
on
there
something
of
man
in
every
woman
and
a
touch
of
the
feminine
in
every
man
but
you
nearer
as
woman
to
the
immediate
personal
life
of
sense
and
reality
than
i
am
as
man
been
so
ever
since
the
men
went
hunting
and
fighting
and
the
women
kept
hut
tended
the
children
and
gathered
roots
in
the
little
cultivation
close
at
hand
it
been
so
perhaps
since
the
female
carried
and
suckled
her
child
and
distinguished
one
male
from
another
it
may
be
it
will
always
be
so
men
were
released
from
that
close
continuous
touch
with
physical
necessities
long
before
women
were
it
only
now
that
women
begin
to
be
released
for
ages
now
men
have
been
wandering
from
field
and
home
and
city
over
the
hills
and
far
away
in
search
of
adventures
and
fresh
ideas
and
the
wells
of
mystery
beyond
the
edge
of
the
world
but
it
only
now
that
the
woman
comes
with
them
too
our
difference
is
a
difference
in
kind
old
marjorie
it
the
difference
between
the
old
adventurer
and
the
new
feet
upon
the
trail
we
got
to
come
said
marjorie
oh
you
got
to
come
no
good
to
be
pioneers
if
the
race
does
not
follow
the
women
are
the
backbone
of
the
race
the
men
are
just
the
individuals
into
this
labrador
and
into
all
the
wild
and
desolate
places
of
thought
and
desire
if
men
come
you
women
have
to
come
too
and
bring
the
race
with
you
some
day
a
long
day
mate
of
my
heart
who
knows
how
long
or
how
far
are
you
at
any
rate
here
dear
woman
of
mine
you
are
he
went
off
at
a
tangent
there
all
those
words
that
seem
to
mean
something
and
then
do
seem
to
mean
anything
that
keep
shifting
to
and
fro
from
the
deepest
significance
to
the
shallowest
of
claptrap
socialism
christianity
you
know
they
are
anything
really
as
yet
they
are
something
trying
to
be
have
i
said
that
before
marjorie
she
looked
round
at
him
you
said
something
like
that
when
you
were
delirious
she
answered
after
a
little
pause
it
one
of
the
ideas
that
you
struggling
with
you
go
on
old
man
and
months
for
repetitions
well
i
mean
that
all
these
things
are
seeking
after
a
sort
of
that
greater
than
our
power
even
of
imaginative
realization
that
what
i
mean
the
kingdom
of
heaven
the
communion
of
saints
the
fellowship
of
men
these
are
things
like
high
peaks
far
out
of
the
common
life
of
every
day
shining
things
that
madden
certain
sorts
of
men
to
climb
certain
sorts
of
us
i
a
religious
man
i
a
socialistic
man
these
calls
are
more
to
me
than
my
daily
bread
got
something
in
me
more
generalizing
than
most
men
i
more
so
than
many
other
men
and
most
other
women
i
more
socialistic
than
you
you
know
marjorie
i
always
felt
you
a
finer
individual
than
me
i
never
had
a
doubt
of
it
you
more
beautiful
by
far
than
i
woman
for
my
man
you
a
keener
appetite
for
things
a
firmer
grip
on
the
substance
of
life
i
love
to
see
you
do
things
love
to
see
you
move
love
to
watch
your
hands
you
cleverer
hands
than
mine
by
far
and
yet
i
a
deeper
and
bigger
thing
than
you
i
reach
up
to
something
you
do
reach
up
to
you
in
life
and
i
a
little
out
of
it
like
one
of
those
fish
that
began
to
be
amphibian
i
go
out
into
something
where
you
do
follow
where
you
hardly
begin
to
follow
that
the
real
perplexity
between
thousands
of
men
and
women
it
seems
to
me
that
the
primitive
socialism
of
christianity
and
all
the
stuff
of
modern
socialism
that
matters
is
really
aiming
almost
unconsciously
i
admit
at
times
at
one
simple
end
at
the
release
of
the
human
spirit
from
the
individualistic
struggle
you
used
the
other
day
marjorie
of
course
i
remember
queer
how
i
go
on
talking
after
you
have
understood
it
was
just
a
flash
said
marjorie
we
have
intimations
neither
of
us
really
understands
we
like
people
climbing
a
mountain
in
a
mist
that
thins
out
for
a
moment
and
shows
valleys
and
cities
and
then
closes
in
again
before
we
can
recognize
them
or
make
out
where
we
are
trafford
thought
when
i
talk
to
you
i
always
felt
i
must
be
too
vague
and
the
very
essence
of
all
this
is
a
vague
thing
something
we
shall
never
come
nearer
to
it
in
all
our
lives
than
to
see
it
as
a
shadow
and
a
glittering
that
escapes
again
into
a
mist
and
yet
everything
that
matters
everything
the
only
thing
that
matters
truly
and
for
ever
through
the
whole
range
of
life
and
we
have
to
serve
it
with
the
keenest
thought
the
utmost
patience
inordinate
veracity
the
practical
trouble
between
your
sort
and
my
sort
marjorie
is
the
trouble
between
faith
and
realization
you
demand
the
outcome
oh
and
i
hate
to
turn
aside
and
realize
i
had
to
do
it
for
seven
years
damnable
years
men
of
my
sort
want
to
understand
we
want
to
understand
and
you
ask
us
to
make
we
want
to
understand
atoms
ions
molecules
refractions
you
ask
us
to
make
rubber
and
diamonds
i
suppose
it
right
that
incidentally
we
should
make
rubber
and
diamonds
finally
i
warn
you
we
will
make
rubber
unnecessary
and
diamonds
valueless
and
again
we
want
to
understand
how
people
react
upon
one
another
to
produce
social
consequences
and
you
ask
us
to
put
it
at
once
into
a
draft
bill
for
the
reform
of
something
or
other
i
suppose
life
lies
between
us
somewhere
we
the
two
poles
of
truth
seeking
and
truth
getting
with
me
alone
it
would
be
nothing
but
a
luminous
dream
with
you
nothing
but
a
scramble
in
which
sooner
or
later
all
the
lamps
would
be
upset
but
it
ever
too
much
of
a
scramble
yet
and
ever
too
little
of
a
dream
all
our
world
over
there
is
full
of
the
confusion
and
wreckage
of
premature
realizations
there
no
real
faith
in
thought
and
knowledge
yet
old
necessity
has
driven
men
so
hard
that
they
still
rush
with
a
wild
urgency
though
she
goads
no
more
greed
and
haste
and
if
indeed
we
seem
to
have
a
moment
breathing
space
then
the
gawdsaker
tramples
us
under
my
dear
cried
marjorie
with
a
sharp
note
of
amusement
what
a
gawdsaker
oh
said
trafford
have
you
heard
that
before
he
the
person
who
gets
excited
by
any
deliberate
discussion
and
gets
up
wringing
his
hands
and
screaming
gawd
sake
let
something
i
think
they
used
it
first
for
pethick
lawrence
that
man
who
did
so
much
to
run
the
old
militant
suffragettes
and
burke
the
proper
discussion
of
future
you
know
you
used
to
have
in
chelsea
with
their
hats
oh
is
the
curse
of
all
progress
the
hectic
consumption
that
kills
a
thousand
good
beginnings
you
see
it
in
small
things
and
in
great
you
see
it
in
my
life
gawdsaking
turned
my
to
cash
and
promotions
gawdsaking
look
at
the
way
the
aviators
took
to
flying
for
prizes
and
the
way
pure
research
is
swamped
by
endowments
for
technical
applications
then
that
poor
of
an
idea
the
socialists
have
it
been
treated
like
one
of
those
unborn
lambs
they
kill
for
the
fine
skin
of
it
made
into
results
before
ever
it
was
alive
was
there
anything
more
pitiful
the
first
great
dream
and
then
the
last
phase
when
your
aunt
plessington
and
the
district
visitors
took
and
used
it
as
a
synonym
for
payment
in
kind
natural
i
suppose
for
people
to
be
eager
for
results
personal
and
immediate
results
the
last
lesson
of
life
is
patience
naturally
they
want
reality
naturally
they
want
the
individual
life
something
to
handle
and
feel
and
use
and
live
by
something
of
their
very
own
before
they
die
and
they
want
it
now
but
the
thing
that
matters
for
the
race
marjorie
is
a
very
different
thing
it
is
to
get
the
emerging
thought
process
clear
and
to
keep
it
clear
and
to
let
those
other
hungers
go
we
got
to
go
back
to
england
on
the
side
of
that
delay
that
arrest
of
interruption
that
detached
observant
synthesizing
process
of
the
mind
that
solvent
of
difficulties
and
obsolescent
institutions
which
is
the
reality
of
collective
human
life
we
got
to
go
back
on
the
side
of
pure
science
literature
untrammeled
by
the
preconceptions
of
the
social
schemers
art
free
from
the
urgency
of
immediate
utility
and
a
new
a
regal
a
sincerity
in
philosophy
and
above
all
we
got
to
stop
this
jackdaw
buying
of
yours
my
dear
which
is
the
essence
of
all
that
is
wrong
with
the
world
this
snatching
at
everything
which
loses
everything
worth
having
in
life
this
greedy
confused
realization
of
our
accumulated
resources
you
going
to
be
a
woman
now
you
to
come
out
of
bond
street
you
and
your
kind
like
israel
leaving
the
egyptian
you
going
to
be
my
wife
and
my
mate
less
of
this
service
of
things
investments
in
comfort
in
security
in
experience
yes
but
not
just
spending
any
more
he
broke
off
abruptly
with
i
want
to
go
back
and
begin
yes
said
marjorie
we
will
go
back
and
saw
minutely
and
distantly
and
yet
as
clearly
and
brightly
as
if
she
looked
into
a
concave
mirror
that
tall
and
dignified
study
a
very
high
room
indeed
with
a
man
writing
before
a
fine
window
and
a
great
lump
of
labradorite
upon
his
desk
before
him
holding
together
an
accumulation
of
written
sheets
she
knew
exactly
the
shop
in
oxford
street
where
the
stuff
for
the
curtains
might
be
best
obtained
one
night
marjorie
had
been
sitting
musing
before
the
stove
for
a
long
time
and
suddenly
she
said
i
wonder
if
we
shall
fail
i
wonder
if
we
shall
get
into
a
mess
again
when
we
are
back
in
london
as
big
a
mess
and
as
utter
a
discontent
as
sent
us
here
trafford
was
scraping
out
his
pipe
and
did
not
answer
for
some
moments
then
he
remarked
what
nonsense
but
we
shall
she
said
everybody
fails
to
some
extent
we
are
bound
to
fail
because
indeed
nothing
is
clear
nothing
is
a
clear
issue
you
know
i
just
the
old
marjorie
really
in
spite
of
all
these
resolutions
the
spendthrift
the
restless
the
eager
i
a
born
snatcher
and
shopper
we
just
the
same
people
really
no
he
said
after
thought
you
all
labrador
older
i
always
failed
she
considered
when
it
came
to
any
special
temptations
rag
i
ca
not
having
a
thing
he
made
no
answer
and
you
still
the
same
old
rag
you
know
she
went
on
who
weakens
into
kindness
if
i
cry
who
likes
me
who
could
endure
to
see
me
poor
not
a
bit
of
it
no
i
a
very
different
rag
with
a
very
different
marjorie
yes
indeed
things
are
graver
why
i
lame
for
life
and
i
a
scar
the
very
of
things
is
changed
he
stared
at
her
face
and
said
you
hidden
the
and
you
think
i
noted
it
it
keeps
on
healing
she
interrupted
and
if
it
comes
to
that
where
my
complexion
she
laughed
these
are
just
the
superficial
aspects
of
the
case
nothing
ever
heals
completely
he
said
answering
her
first
sentence
and
nothing
ever
goes
back
to
the
exact
place
it
held
before
we
different
you
wife
of
character
is
character
said
marjorie
coming
back
to
her
point
do
exaggerate
conversion
dear
it
not
a
bit
of
good
pretending
we
sha
fall
away
both
of
us
each
in
our
own
manner
we
shall
we
shall
old
man
london
is
still
a
tempting
and
confusing
place
and
you
ca
alter
people
fundamentally
not
even
by
and
them
you
only
alter
people
fundamentally
by
killing
them
and
replacing
them
i
shall
be
extravagant
again
and
forget
again
try
as
i
may
and
you
will
work
again
and
fall
away
again
and
forgive
me
again
you
know
it
just
as
though
we
were
each
of
us
not
one
person
but
a
lot
of
persons
who
sometimes
meet
and
shout
all
together
and
then
disperse
and
forget
and
plot
against
each
other
oh
things
will
happen
again
said
trafford
in
her
pause
but
they
will
happen
again
with
a
difference
after
this
with
a
difference
that
the
good
of
it
all
we
found
something
here
that
makes
everything
different
we
found
each
other
too
dear
wife
she
thought
intently
i
am
afraid
she
whispered
but
what
is
there
to
be
afraid
of
she
spoke
after
a
little
pause
that
seemed
to
hesitate
at
times
i
wish
oh
passionately
that
i
could
pray
why
do
you
i
do
believe
enough
in
that
i
wish
i
did
trafford
thought
people
are
always
so
exacting
about
prayer
he
said
exacting
you
want
to
pray
and
you
ca
make
terms
for
a
thing
you
want
i
used
to
think
i
could
i
wanted
god
to
come
and
demonstrate
a
bit
it
no
good
madge
if
god
chooses
to
be
silent
you
must
pray
to
the
silence
if
he
chooses
to
live
in
darkness
you
must
pray
to
the
night
yes
said
marjorie
i
suppose
one
must
she
thought
i
suppose
in
the
end
one
does
she
said
mixed
up
with
this
entirely
characteristic
theology
of
theirs
and
their
elaborate
of
a
new
life
in
london
were
other
strands
of
thought
queer
memories
of
london
and
old
times
together
would
flash
with
a
peculiar
brightness
across
their
contemplation
of
the
infinities
and
the
needs
of
mankind
out
of
nowhere
quite
disconnectedly
would
come
the
human
finite
do
you
remember
two
things
particularly
pressed
into
their
minds
one
was
the
thought
of
their
children
and
i
do
not
care
to
tell
how
often
in
the
day
now
they
calculated
the
time
in
england
and
tried
to
guess
to
a
half
mile
or
so
where
those
young
people
might
be
and
what
they
might
be
doing
the
shops
are
bright
for
christmas
now
said
marjorie
this
year
dick
was
to
have
had
his
first
fireworks
i
wonder
if
he
did
i
wonder
if
he
burnt
his
dear
little
funny
stumps
of
fingers
i
hope
not
oh
just
a
little
said
trafford
i
remember
how
a
squib
made
my
glove
smoulder
and
singed
me
and
how
my
mother
kissed
me
for
taking
it
like
a
man
it
was
the
best
part
of
the
adventure
dick
shall
burn
his
fingers
when
his
mother
home
to
kiss
him
but
spare
his
fingers
now
dadda
the
other
topic
was
food
it
was
only
after
they
had
been
doing
it
for
a
week
or
so
that
they
remarked
how
steadily
they
gravitated
to
reminiscences
suggestions
descriptions
and
long
discussions
of
eatables
sound
solid
eatables
they
told
over
the
particulars
of
dinners
they
had
imagined
altogether
forgotten
neither
hosts
nor
conversations
seemed
to
matter
now
in
the
slightest
degree
but
every
item
in
the
menu
had
its
place
they
nearly
quarrelled
one
day
about
trafford
wanted
to
dwell
on
them
when
marjorie
was
eager
for
the
soup
it
niggling
with
food
said
marjorie
oh
but
there
no
reason
said
trafford
why
you
should
take
a
lot
of
three
or
four
sardines
and
potato
salad
and
a
big
piece
of
smoked
salmon
and
some
of
that
norwegian
herring
and
so
on
and
keep
the
olives
by
you
to
pick
at
it
a
beginning
it
it
immoral
said
marjorie
that
what
i
feel
if
one
needs
a
whet
to
eat
one
should
eat
the
proper
beginning
of
a
dinner
is
soup
good
hot
soup
thick
soup
with
things
in
it
vegetables
and
meat
and
things
bits
of
oxtail
not
peas
no
not
peas
is
tiresome
i
never
knew
anything
one
tired
of
so
soon
i
wish
we
had
relied
on
it
so
much
thick
soup
all
very
well
said
trafford
but
how
about
that
clear
stuff
they
give
you
in
the
little
pavement
restaurants
in
paris
you
know
with
lovely
great
crusts
and
big
leeks
and
lettuce
leaves
and
so
on
tremendous
aroma
of
onions
and
beautiful
little
beads
of
fat
and
being
a
clear
soup
you
see
what
there
is
that
interesting
centimes
marjorie
lord
i
give
a
guinea
a
plate
for
it
i
give
five
pounds
for
one
of
those
jolly
tureens
full
you
know
with
little
drops
all
over
the
outside
of
it
and
the
ladle
sticking
out
under
the
lid
have
you
ever
tasted
turtle
soup
rather
they
give
it
you
in
the
city
the
fat
ripping
but
rather
precious
with
it
you
know
for
my
own
part
i
do
think
soup
should
be
out
i
always
liked
the
soup
we
used
to
get
at
the
harts
but
then
they
never
give
you
enough
you
know
not
nearly
enough
about
a
tablespoonful
said
marjorie
it
mocking
an
appetite
still
there
things
to
follow
said
trafford
they
discussed
the
proper
order
of
a
dinner
very
carefully
they
decided
that
sorbets
and
ices
were
not
only
unwholesome
but
nasty
in
london
said
trafford
one
taste
gets
they
weighed
the
merits
of
french
cookery
modern
international
cookery
and
produced
alternatives
trafford
became
very
eloquent
about
old
english
food
dinners
said
trafford
should
be
feasting
not
the
mere
satisfaction
of
a
necessity
there
should
be
i
remember
a
recipe
for
a
pie
i
think
it
was
in
one
of
those
books
that
man
lucas
used
to
compile
if
i
remember
rightly
it
began
with
a
swine
and
hew
it
into
gobbets
gobbets
that
something
like
a
beginning
it
was
a
big
pie
with
tiers
and
tiers
of
things
and
it
kept
it
up
all
the
way
in
that
key
and
then
what
could
be
better
than
prime
roast
beef
reddish
just
a
shade
on
the
side
of
underdone
and
not
too
finely
cut
mutton
ca
touch
it
beef
is
the
best
she
said
then
our
english
cold
meat
again
what
can
equal
it
such
stuff
as
they
give
in
a
good
country
inn
a
huge
joint
of
beef
you
cut
from
it
yourself
you
know
as
much
as
you
like
with
mustard
pickles
celery
a
tankard
of
stout
let
us
say
pressed
beef
such
as
they
give
you
at
the
reform
too
that
good
eating
for
a
man
with
chutney
and
then
old
cheese
to
follow
and
boiled
beef
with
little
carrots
and
turnips
and
a
dumpling
or
so
eh
of
course
said
marjorie
one
must
do
justice
to
a
turkey
a
turkey
or
a
good
goose
for
the
matter
of
that
with
honest
stuffing
i
like
the
little
sausages
round
the
dish
of
a
turkey
too
like
cherubs
they
are
round
the
feet
of
a
madonna
there
much
to
be
said
for
sausage
marjorie
it
concentrates
sausage
led
to
germany
i
not
one
of
those
patriots
he
was
saying
presently
who
run
down
other
countries
by
way
of
glorifying
their
own
while
i
was
in
germany
i
tasted
many
good
things
there
their
leberwurst
it
never
bad
and
at
its
best
it
splendid
it
only
a
fool
would
reproach
germany
with
sausage
devonshire
of
course
is
the
master
of
any
blutwurst
but
there
all
those
others
on
the
german
side
frankfurter
big
reddish
sausage
stuff
again
with
great
crystalline
lumps
of
white
fat
and
how
well
they
cook
their
rich
hashes
and
the
thick
gravies
they
make
curious
how
much
better
the
cooking
of
teutonic
peoples
is
than
the
cooking
of
the
south
europeans
it
as
if
one
needed
a
colder
climate
to
brace
a
cook
to
his
business
the
frenchman
and
the
italian
trifle
and
stimulate
it
as
if
never
met
a
hungry
man
no
german
would
have
thought
of
ugh
it
vicious
eating
there
much
that
fine
though
in
austria
and
hungary
i
wish
i
had
travelled
in
hungary
do
you
remember
how
once
or
twice
we
lunched
at
that
viennese
place
in
regent
street
and
how
they
given
us
stuffed
paprika
eh
that
was
a
good
place
i
remember
there
was
stewed
beef
once
with
a
lot
of
barley
such
barley
every
country
has
its
glories
one
talks
of
the
cookery
of
northern
countries
and
then
suddenly
one
thinks
of
curry
with
lots
of
rice
and
lots
of
chicken
and
lots
of
hot
curry
powder
hot
and
look
at
america
here
a
people
who
have
any
of
them
been
out
of
europe
for
centuries
and
yet
they
have
as
different
a
table
as
you
could
well
imagine
there
a
kind
of
fish
planked
shad
that
they
cook
on
resinous
wood
roast
it
i
suppose
it
substantial
like
nothing
else
in
the
world
and
how
good
too
with
turkey
are
sweet
potatoes
then
they
have
such
a
multitude
of
cereal
things
stuff
like
their
buckwheat
cakes
all
swimming
in
golden
syrup
and
indian
corn
again
of
course
corn
is
being
anglicized
i
often
given
you
corn
latterly
before
we
came
away
that
sort
of
separated
grain
out
of
tins
like
chicken
food
not
the
real
thing
you
should
eat
corn
on
the
cob
american
fashion
it
fine
i
had
it
when
i
was
in
the
states
you
know
you
take
it
up
in
your
hands
by
both
ends
you
seen
the
cobs
and
gnaw
the
craving
air
of
labrador
at
a
temperature
of
fahrenheit
and
methodically
stinted
rations
make
great
changes
in
the
outward
qualities
of
the
mind
like
to
do
that
said
marjorie
her
face
flushed
a
little
at
a
guilty
thought
her
eyes
sparkled
she
leant
forward
and
spoke
in
a
confidential
undertone
i
like
to
eat
a
mutton
chop
like
said
marjorie
one
morning
marjorie
broached
something
she
had
had
on
her
mind
for
several
days
old
man
she
said
i
ca
stand
it
any
longer
i
going
to
thaw
my
scissors
and
cut
your
hair
and
then
you
have
to
trim
that
beard
of
yours
you
have
to
dig
out
that
i
know
said
marjorie
she
looked
at
him
you
never
be
a
pretty
man
again
she
said
but
there
a
sort
of
wild
splendour
and
i
love
every
inch
and
scrap
of
you
their
eyes
met
we
a
thousand
deeps
now
below
the
look
of

said
trafford

chapter
the
fifth
the
trail
to
the
sea
one
astonishing
afternoon
in
january
a
man
came
out
of
the
wilderness
to
lonely
hut
he
was
a
a
trapper
up
and
down
the
green
river
and
across
the
height
of
land
to
sea
lake
he
arrived
in
a
sort
of
shy
silence
and
squatted
amiably
on
a
log
to
thaw
much
snow
he
said
and
little
fur
after
he
had
sat
at
their
fire
for
an
hour
and
eaten
and
drunk
his
purpose
in
coming
thawed
out
he
explained
he
had
just
come
on
to
them
to
see
how
they
were
he
was
he
said
a
planter
furring
he
had
a
line
of
traps
about
a
hundred
and
twenty
miles
in
length
the
nearest
trap
in
his
path
before
he
turned
northward
over
the
divide
was
a
good
forty
miles
down
the
river
he
had
come
on
from
there
just
to
have
a
look
his
name
he
said
was
louis
napoleon
partington
he
had
carried
a
big
pack
a
rifle
and
a
dead
marten
they
lay
beside
him
and
out
of
his
shapeless
mass
of
caribou
skins
and
woolen
clothing
and
wrappings
peeped
a
genial
oily
brown
face
very
dirty
with
a
strand
of
hair
across
one
eye
irregular
teeth
in
its
friendly
smile
and
little
eyes
conversation
developed
there
had
been
doubts
of
his
linguistic
range
at
first
but
he
had
an
understanding
expression
and
his
english
seemed
guttural
rather
than
really
bad
he
was
told
the
tremendous
story
of
trafford
leg
was
shown
it
and
felt
it
he
interpolated
thick
and
whistling
noises
to
show
how
completely
he
followed
their
explanations
and
then
suddenly
he
began
a
speech
that
made
all
his
earlier
taciturnity
seem
but
the
dam
of
a
great
reservoir
of
mixed
and
partly
incomprehensible
english
he
complimented
marjorie
so
effusively
and
relentlessly
and
shamelessly
as
to
produce
a
pause
when
he
had
done
yes
he
said
and
nodded
to
button
up
the
whole
he
sucked
his
pipe
well
satisfied
with
his
eloquence
trafford
spoke
in
his
silence
we
are
coming
down
he
said
i
thought
perhaps
whispered
louis
napoleon
yes
said
trafford
we
are
coming
down
with
you
why
not
we
can
get
a
sledge
over
the
snow
now
it
hard
i
mean
a
flat
sledge
like
see
like
this
he
got
up
and
dragged
marjorie
old
arrangement
into
view
we
shall
bring
all
the
stuff
we
can
down
with
us
grub
blankets
not
the
tent
it
too
bulky
we
leave
a
lot
of
the
heavy
gear
you
have
to
leave
the
tent
said
louis
napoleon
i
leave
the
tent
and
you
have
to
leave
some
of
those
tins
nearly
all
of
them
and
the
ammunition
there
except
just
a
little
just
enough
for
the
journey
down
perhaps
a
gun
no
not
a
gun
though
after
all
well
we
return
one
of
the
guns
give
it
you
to
bring
back
here
bring
back
here
if
you
liked
for
some
moments
louis
napoleon
was
intently
silent
when
he
spoke
his
voice
was
guttural
with
emotion
after
he
said
thoughtfully
and
paused
and
then
resolved
to
have
it
over
forthwith
all
you
leave
will
be
mine
eh
trafford
said
that
was
the
idea
louis
napoleon
eye
brightened
but
his
face
preserved
its
indian
calm
i
will
take
you
right
to
hammond
he
said
where
they
have
dogs
and
then
i
can
come
back
here
they
had
talked
out
nearly
every
particular
of
their
return
before
they
slept
that
night
they
yarned
away
three
hours
over
the
first
generous
meal
that
any
one
of
them
had
eaten
for
many
weeks
louis
napoleon
stayed
in
the
hut
as
a
matter
of
course
and
reposed
with
snores
and
choking
upon
marjorie
sledge
and
within
a
yard
of
her
it
struck
her
as
she
lay
awake
and
listened
that
the
housemaids
in
sussex
square
would
have
thought
things
a
little
congested
for
a
lady
bedroom
and
then
she
reflected
that
after
all
it
was
much
worse
than
a
crowded
carriage
in
an
train
from
switzerland
she
tried
to
count
how
many
people
there
had
been
in
that
compartment
and
failed
how
stuffy
that
had
been
the
smell
of
cheese
and
all
and
with
that
after
a
dream
that
she
was
whaling
and
had
harpooned
a
particularly
whale
she
fell
very
peacefully
into
oblivion
next
day
was
spent
in
the
careful
preparation
of
the
two
sledges
they
intended
to
take
a
full
provision
for
six
weeks
although
they
reckoned
that
with
good
weather
they
ought
to
be
down
at
hammond
in
four
the
day
after
was
sunday
and
louis
napoleon
would
not
look
at
the
sledges
or
packing
instead
he
held
a
kind
of
religious
service
which
consisted
partly
in
making
trafford
read
aloud
out
of
a
very
oily
old
new
testament
he
produced
a
selected
passage
from
the
book
of
corinthians
and
partly
in
moaning
rather
than
singing
several
hymns
he
was
rather
disappointed
that
they
did
not
join
in
with
him
in
the
afternoon
he
heated
some
water
went
into
the
tent
with
it
and
it
would
appear
partially
washed
his
face
in
the
evening
after
they
had
supped
he
discussed
religion
being
curious
by
this
time
about
their
beliefs
and
procedure
he
spread
his
mental
and
spiritual
equipment
before
them
very
artlessly
their
isolation
and
their
immense
concentration
on
each
other
had
made
them
sensitive
to
personal
quality
and
they
listened
to
the
broken
english
and
the
queer
tangential
starts
into
new
topics
of
this
dirty
mongrel
creature
with
the
keenest
appreciation
of
its
quality
it
was
inconsistent
miscellaneous
simple
honest
and
human
it
was
as
touching
as
the
medley
in
the
pocket
of
a
dead
schoolboy
he
was
superstitious
and
sceptical
and
sensual
and
spiritual
and
very
very
earnest
the
things
he
believed
even
if
they
were
just
beliefs
about
the
weather
or
drying
venison
or
filling
pipes
he
believed
with
emotion
he
flushed
as
he
told
them
for
all
his
intellectual
muddle
they
felt
he
knew
how
to
live
honestly
and
die
if
need
be
very
finely
he
was
more
than
a
little
distressed
at
their
apparent
ignorance
of
the
truths
of
revealed
religion
as
it
is
taught
in
the
moravian
schools
upon
the
coast
and
indeed
it
was
manifest
that
he
had
had
far
more
careful
and
infinitely
more
sincere
religious
teaching
than
either
trafford
or
marjorie
for
a
time
the
missionary
spirit
inspired
him
and
then
he
quite
forgot
his
solicitude
for
their
conversion
in
a
number
of
increasingly
tall
anecdotes
about
hunters
and
fishermen
illustrating
at
first
the
extreme
dangers
of
any
departure
from
a
rigid
sabbatarianism
but
presently
becoming
just
stories
illustrating
the
uncertainty
of
life
thence
he
branched
off
to
the
general
topic
of
life
upon
the
coast
and
the
relative
advantages
of
planter
and
fisherman
and
then
with
a
kindling
eye
he
spoke
of
women
and
how
that
some
day
he
would
marry
his
voice
softened
and
he
addressed
himself
more
particularly
to
marjorie
he
did
so
much
introduce
the
topic
of
the
lady
as
allow
the
destined
young
woman
suddenly
to
pervade
his
discourse
she
was
it
seemed
a
servant
an
esquimaux
girl
at
the
moravian
mission
station
at
manivikovik
he
had
been
plighted
to
her
for
nine
years
he
described
a
gramophone
he
had
purchased
down
at
port
dupré
and
brought
back
to
her
three
hundred
miles
up
the
coast
it
seemed
to
marjorie
an
odd
gift
for
an
esquimaux
maiden
and
he
gave
his
views
upon
its
mechanism
he
said
god
was
with
the
man
who
invented
the
gramophone
truly
they
would
have
found
one
a
very
great
relief
to
the
tediums
of
their
sojourn
at
lonely
hut
the
gramophone
he
had
given
his
betrothed
possessed
records
of
the
rev
capel
gumm
preaching
and
of
madame
melba
singing
a
revival
hymn
called
sowing
the
seed
and
a
comic
song
they
could
not
make
out
his
pronunciation
of
the
title
that
made
you
die
with
laughter
it
goes
gobble
gobble
gobble
he
said
with
a
solemn
appreciative
reflection
of
those
distant
joys
it
good
to
be
jolly
at
times
he
said
with
his
bright
eyes
scanning
marjorie
face
a
little
doubtfully
as
if
such
ideas
were
better
left
for
expression
their
return
was
a
very
different
journey
from
the
toilsome
ascent
of
the
summer
an
immense
abundance
of
snow
masked
the
world
snow
that
made
them
regret
acutely
they
had
not
equipped
themselves
with
ski
with
ski
and
a
good
circulation
a
man
may
go
about
labrador
in
winter
six
times
more
easily
than
by
the
canoes
and
slow
trudging
of
summer
travel
as
it
was
they
were
glad
of
their
canadian
snow
shoes
one
needs
only
shelters
after
the
alpine
club
hut
fashion
and
all
that
vast
solitary
country
would
be
open
in
the
wintertime
its
shortest
day
is
no
shorter
than
the
shortest
day
in
cumberland
or
dublin
this
is
no
place
to
tell
of
the
beauty
and
wonder
of
snow
and
ice
the
soft
contours
of
gentle
slopes
the
rippling
of
fine
snow
under
a
steady
wind
the
long
shadow
ridges
of
shining
powder
on
the
lee
of
trees
and
stones
and
rocks
the
delicate
wind
streaks
over
broad
surfaces
like
the
marks
of
a
chisel
in
marble
the
crests
and
cornices
the
vivid
brightness
of
edges
in
the
sun
the
glowing
yellowish
light
on
sunlit
surfaces
the
long
blue
shadows
the
flush
of
sunset
and
sunrise
and
the
pallid
unearthly
desolation
of
snow
beneath
the
moon
nor
need
the
broken
snow
in
woods
and
amidst
tumbled
stony
slopes
be
described
nor
the
vast
soft
overhanging
crests
on
every
outstanding
rock
beside
the
icebound
river
nor
the
huge
stalactites
and
stalagmites
of
ice
below
the
cliffs
nor
trees
burdened
and
broken
by
frost
and
snow
nor
snow
upon
ice
nor
the
blue
pools
at
upon
the
surface
of
the
across
the
smooth
ice
of
the
open
tarns
they
would
find
a
growth
of
ice
flowers
and
complicated
more
abundant
and
more
beautiful
than
the
alpine
summer
flowers
but
the
wind
was
very
bitter
and
the
sun
had
scarcely
passed
its
zenith
before
the
thought
of
fuel
and
shelter
came
back
into
their
minds
as
they
approached
partington
tilt
at
the
point
where
his
trapping
ground
turned
out
of
the
green
river
gorge
he
became
greatly
obsessed
by
the
thought
of
his
traps
he
began
to
talk
of
all
that
he
might
find
in
them
all
he
hoped
to
find
and
the
dallars
that
might
ensue
they
slept
the
third
night
marjorie
within
and
the
two
men
under
the
lee
of
the
little
cabin
and
partington
was
up
and
away
before
dawn
to
a
trap
towards
the
ridge
he
had
infected
marjorie
and
trafford
with
a
sympathetic
keenness
but
when
they
saw
his
killing
of
a
marten
that
was
still
alive
in
its
trap
they
suddenly
conceived
a
distaste
for
trapping
they
insisted
they
must
witness
no
more
they
would
wait
while
he
went
to
a
trap
think
what
he
doing
said
trafford
as
they
sat
together
under
the
lee
of
a
rock
waiting
for
him
we
imagined
this
was
a
free
man
leading
an
unsophisticated
life
on
the
very
edge
of
humanity
and
really
he
is
as
much
a
dependant
of
your
woman
world
marjorie
as
any
sweated
seamstress
in
a
marylebone
slum
lord
how
far
those
pretty
wasteful
hands
of
women
reach
all
these
poor
broken
and
starving
beasts
he
finds
and
slaughters
are
from
the
point
of
view
of
our
world
just
furs
furs
poor
little
snarling
unfortunates
their
pelts
will
be
dressed
and
prepared
because
women
who
have
never
dreamt
of
this
bleak
wilderness
desire
them
they
will
get
at
last
into
regent
street
shops
and
bond
street
shops
and
shops
in
fifth
avenue
and
in
paris
and
berlin
they
will
make
delightful
deep
muffs
with
scent
and
little
bags
and
powder
puffs
and
all
sorts
of
things
tucked
away
inside
and
long
wraps
for
tall
women
and
jolly
little
frames
of
soft
fur
for
pretty
faces
and
dainty
coats
and
rugs
for
expensive
little
babies
in
kensington
i
wonder
reflected
marjorie
if
i
could
buy
one
perhaps
as
a
memento
he
looked
at
her
with
eyes
of
quiet
amusement
oh
she
cried
i
did
mean
to
the
old
eve
the
old
adam
is
with
her
said
trafford
he
wanting
to
give
it
her
we
do
cease
to
be
human
madge
you
know
because
we
got
an
idea
now
of
just
where
we
are
i
wonder
which
would
you
like
i
dare
say
we
could
arrange
it
no
said
marjorie
and
thought
it
would
be
jolly
she
said
all
the
same
you
know
and
just
to
show
you
i
not
going
to
let
you
buy
me
that
fur
i
like
to
said
trafford
no
said
marjorie
with
a
decision
that
was
almost
fierce
i
mean
it
i
got
more
to
do
than
you
in
the
way
of
reforming
it
just
because
always
i
let
my
life
be
made
up
of
such
little
things
that
i
must
indeed
i
must
do
make
things
hard
for
me
he
looked
at
her
for
a
moment
very
well
he
said
but
i
have
liked
you
right
he
added
five
seconds
later
oh
i
right
one
day
louis
napoleon
sent
them
on
along
the
trail
while
he
went
up
the
mountain
to
a
trap
among
the
trees
he
rejoined
them
not
as
his
custom
was
shouting
inaudible
conversation
for
the
last
hundred
yards
or
so
but
in
silence
they
wondered
at
that
and
at
the
one
clumsy
gesture
that
flourished
something
darkly
grey
at
them
what
had
happened
to
the
man
whatever
he
had
caught
he
was
hugging
it
as
one
hugs
a
cat
and
stroking
it
ugh
he
said
deeply
drawing
near
oh
a
solemn
joy
irradiated
his
face
and
almost
religious
ecstasy
found
expression
he
had
got
a
silver
fox
a
beautifully
marked
silver
fox
the
best
luck
of
labrador
one
goes
for
years
without
one
in
hope
and
when
it
comes
it
pays
the
trapper
debts
it
clears
his
life
for
years
they
tried
poor
inadequate
congratulation
as
they
sat
about
the
fire
that
night
a
silence
came
upon
louis
napoleon
it
was
manifest
that
his
mind
was
preoccupied
he
got
up
walked
about
inspected
the
miracle
of
fur
that
had
happened
to
him
returned
regarded
them
he
said
and
stroked
his
chin
with
his
forefinger
a
certain
diffidence
and
yet
a
certain
dignity
of
assurance
mingled
in
his
manner
it
was
so
much
a
doubt
of
his
own
correctness
as
of
some
possible
ignorance
of
the
finer
shades
on
their
part
that
might
embarrass
him
he
coughed
a
curt
preface
and
intimated
he
had
a
request
to
make
behind
the
indian
calm
of
his
face
glowed
tremendous
feeling
like
the
light
of
a
foundry
furnace
shining
through
chinks
in
the
door
he
spoke
in
a
small
flat
voice
exercising
great
his
wish
he
said
in
view
of
all
that
had
happened
was
a
little
thing
this
was
nearly
a
perfect
day
for
him
and
one
thing
only
remained
well
he
said
and
hung
well
said
trafford
he
plunged
just
simply
this
would
they
give
him
the
brandy
bottle
and
let
him
get
drunk
grenfell
was
a
good
man
a
very
good
man
but
he
had
made
brandy
dear
dear
beyond
the
reach
of
common
men
altogether
along
the
coast
he
explained
dear
bundle
of
clothes
and
dirt
that
he
was
always
perfectly
respectable
when
he
was
drunk
it
seemed
strange
to
trafford
that
now
that
marjorie
was
going
home
a
wild
impatience
to
see
her
children
should
possess
her
so
long
as
it
had
been
probable
that
they
would
stay
out
their
year
in
labrador
that
separation
had
seemed
mainly
a
sentimental
trouble
now
at
times
it
was
like
an
animal
craving
she
would
talk
of
them
for
hours
at
a
stretch
and
when
she
was
not
talking
he
could
see
her
eyes
fixed
ahead
and
knew
that
she
was
anticipating
a
meeting
and
for
the
first
time
it
seemed
the
idea
of
possible
misadventure
troubled
her
they
reached
hammond
in
one
and
twenty
days
from
lonely
hut
three
days
they
had
been
forced
to
camp
because
of
a
blizzard
and
three
because
louis
napoleon
was
rigidly
sabbatarian
they
parted
from
him
reluctantly
and
the
next
day
hammond
produced
its
dogs
twelve
stout
but
extremely
hungry
dogs
and
sent
the
traffords
on
to
the
green
river
where
there
were
good
beds
and
a
copious
supply
of
hot
water
thence
they
went
to
manivikovik
and
thence
the
new
marconi
station
sent
their
inquiries
home
inquiries
that
were
answered
next
day
with
brevity
everyone
well
love
from
all
when
the
operator
hurried
with
that
to
marjorie
she
received
it
glanced
at
it
carelessly
asked
him
to
smoke
remarked
that
wireless
telegraphy
was
a
wonderful
thing
and
then
in
the
midst
of
some
unfinished
commonplace
about
the
temperature
broke
down
and
wept
wildly
and
uncontrollably
then
came
the
long
wonderful
ride
southward
day
after
day
along
the
coast
to
port
dupré
a
ride
from
headland
to
headland
across
the
frozen
bays
behind
long
teams
of
straining
furry
dogs
that
leapt
and
yelped
as
they
ran
sometimes
over
the
land
the
brutes
shirked
and
loitered
and
called
for
the
whip
they
were
a
quarrelsome
crew
to
keep
waiting
but
across
the
they
went
like
the
wind
and
downhill
the
komatic
chased
their
waving
tails
the
sledges
swayed
and
leapt
depressions
and
shot
athwart
icy
stretches
the
traffords
spectacled
and
wrapped
to
their
noses
had
all
the
sensations
then
of
hunting
an
unknown
quarry
behind
a
pack
of
wolves
the
snow
blazed
under
the
sun
out
to
sea
beyond
the
ice
the
water
glittered
and
it
was
so
much
air
they
breathed
as
a
sort
of
joyous
hunger
one
day
their
teams
insisted
upon
racing
marjorie
team
was
the
heavier
her
driver
more
skillful
and
her
sledge
the
lighter
and
she
led
in
that
wild
chase
from
start
to
finish
but
ever
and
again
trafford
made
wild
spurts
that
brought
him
almost
level
once
as
he
came
alongside
she
heard
him
laughing
joyously
marjorie
he
shouted
remember
old
donkey
cart
her
team
yawed
away
and
as
he
swept
near
again
behind
his
pack
of
whimpering
straining
furious
dogs
she
heard
him
shouting
you
know
that
old
cart
under
the
overhanging
trees
so
thick
and
green
they
met
overhead
you
know
when
you
and
i
had
our
first
talk
together
in
the
lane
it
was
so
fast
as
this
eh
at
port
dupré
they
stayed
ten
days
days
that
marjorie
could
only
make
tolerable
by
knitting
absurd
garments
for
the
children
her
knitting
was
atrocious
and
then
one
afternoon
they
heard
the
gun
of
the
the
new
winter
steamer
from
john
signalling
as
it
came
