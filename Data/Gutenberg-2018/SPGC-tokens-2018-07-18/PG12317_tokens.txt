two
little
knights
of
kentucky
chapter
i
two
tramps
and
a
bear
it
was
the
coldest
saint
valentine
eve
that
kentucky
had
known
in
twenty
years
in
lloydsborough
valley
a
thin
sprinkling
of
snow
whitened
the
meadows
enough
to
show
the
footprints
of
every
hungry
rabbit
that
loped
across
them
but
there
were
not
many
such
tracks
it
was
so
cold
that
the
rabbits
for
all
their
thick
fur
were
glad
to
run
home
and
hide
nobody
cared
to
be
out
long
in
such
weather
and
except
now
and
then
when
an
wagon
creaked
up
from
some
pond
to
the
frozen
pike
the
wintry
stillness
was
unbroken
on
the
north
side
of
the
little
country
depot
a
long
row
of
icicles
hung
from
the
eaves
even
the
wind
seemed
to
catch
its
breath
there
and
hurry
on
with
a
shiver
that
reached
to
the
telegraph
wires
overhead
it
shivered
down
the
long
stovepipe
too
inside
the
the
stove
had
been
kept
all
that
dull
gray
afternoon
but
the
were
still
white
with
heavy
half
an
hour
before
the
five
train
was
due
from
the
city
two
boys
came
running
up
the
railroad
track
with
their
skates
in
their
hands
they
were
handsome
sturdy
little
fellows
so
well
buttoned
up
in
their
leather
leggins
and
warm
reefer
overcoats
that
they
scarcely
felt
the
cold
their
cheeks
were
red
as
winter
apples
from
skating
against
the
wind
and
they
were
almost
breathless
after
their
long
run
to
the
depot
racing
across
the
platform
they
bumped
against
the
door
at
the
same
instant
burst
it
noisily
open
and
slammed
it
behind
them
with
a
bang
that
shook
the
entire
building
what
kind
of
a
cyclone
has
struck
us
now
growled
the
ticket
agent
who
was
in
the
next
room
then
he
frowned
as
the
first
noise
was
followed
by
the
rasping
sound
of
a
bench
being
dragged
out
of
a
corner
to
a
place
nearer
the
stove
it
scraped
the
bare
floor
every
inch
of
the
way
with
a
jarring
motion
that
made
the
windows
rattle
stretching
himself
out
of
his
chair
the
ticket
agent
pushed
up
the
wooden
slide
of
the
little
window
far
enough
for
him
to
peep
into
the
then
he
hastily
shoved
it
down
again
it
the
two
little
chaps
who
came
out
from
the
city
last
week
he
said
to
the
the
maclntyre
boys
you
think
they
own
the
earth
from
the
way
they
dash
in
and
take
possession
of
things
the
liked
boys
he
stroked
his
gray
beard
and
chuckled
well
meyers
he
said
slowly
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
their
family
always
has
owned
a
pretty
fair
slice
of
the
earth
and
its
good
things
and
those
same
little
lads
have
travelled
nearly
all
over
it
although
the
oldest
ca
be
more
than
ten
it
would
be
a
wonder
if
they
did
have
that
lordly
way
of
making
themselves
at
home
wherever
they
go
will
they
be
out
here
all
winter
asked
meyers
who
was
a
newcomer
in
lloydsborough
yes
their
father
and
mother
have
gone
to
florida
and
left
them
here
with
their
grandmother
maclntyre
i
imagine
the
old
lady
has
her
hands
full
said
meyers
as
a
sound
of
scuffling
in
the
next
room
reached
him
oh
i
do
know
about
that
now
said
the
noisy
children
to
be
sure
and
just
boiling
over
with
mischief
but
if
you
can
find
any
little
gentlemen
anywhere
in
the
state
when
there
ladies
around
i
like
you
to
trot
out
they
came
down
to
the
train
with
their
aunt
this
morning
miss
allison
maclntyre
and
their
politeness
to
her
was
something
pretty
to
see
i
can
tell
you
sir
there
was
a
moment
pause
in
which
the
boys
could
be
heard
laughing
in
the
next
room
no
said
the
again
i
thinking
it
not
the
boys
who
will
be
keeping
maclntyre
hands
full
this
winter
so
much
as
that
little
granddaughter
of
hers
that
came
here
last
fall
little
virginia
dudley
you
can
guess
what
she
like
from
her
nickname
they
call
her
ginger
she
had
always
lived
at
some
army
post
out
west
until
her
father
captain
dudley
was
ordered
to
cuba
he
was
wounded
down
there
and
has
never
been
entirely
well
since
when
he
found
they
were
going
to
keep
him
there
all
winter
he
sent
for
his
wife
last
september
and
there
was
nothing
to
do
with
virginia
but
to
bring
her
back
to
kentucky
to
her
grandmother
oh
she
the
little
girl
who
went
in
on
the
train
this
morning
with
miss
allison
said
the
ticket
agent
i
suppose
the
boys
have
come
down
to
meet
them
they
have
a
long
time
to
wait
while
this
conversation
was
going
on
behind
the
ticket
window
the
two
boys
stretched
themselves
out
on
a
long
bench
beside
the
stove
the
warm
room
made
them
feel
drowsy
after
their
violent
exercise
keith
the
younger
one
yawned
several
times
and
finally
lay
down
on
the
bench
with
his
cap
for
a
pillow
he
was
eight
years
old
but
curled
up
in
that
fashion
with
his
long
eyelashes
resting
on
his
red
cheeks
and
one
plump
little
hand
tucked
under
his
chin
he
looked
much
younger
wake
me
up
malcolm
when
it
time
for
aunt
allison
train
he
said
to
his
brother
ginger
would
never
stop
teasing
me
if
she
should
find
me
asleep
malcolm
unbuttoned
his
reefer
and
after
much
tugging
pulled
out
a
handsome
little
gold
watch
oh
there
a
long
time
to
wait
he
exclaimed
we
need
not
have
left
the
pond
so
early
for
the
train
will
not
be
here
for
minutes
i
believe
i
curl
up
here
myself
till
then
i
hope
they
wo
forget
the
valentines
we
sent
for
the
room
was
very
still
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
no
sound
at
all
except
the
crackling
of
the
fire
and
the
shivering
of
the
wind
in
the
long
stovepipe
then
some
one
turned
the
so
cautiously
and
slowly
that
it
unlatched
without
a
sound
it
was
the
cold
air
rushing
into
the
room
as
the
door
was
pushed
ajar
that
aroused
the
boys
after
one
surprised
glance
they
sat
up
for
the
man
who
was
slipping
into
the
room
as
stealthily
as
a
burglar
was
the
tramp
they
had
ever
seen
there
was
a
long
ugly
red
scar
across
his
face
running
from
his
cheek
to
the
middle
of
his
forehead
and
partly
closing
one
eye
perhaps
it
was
the
scar
that
gave
him
such
a
queer
evil
sort
of
an
expression
even
without
it
he
would
have
been
a
repulsive
sight
his
clothes
were
dirty
and
ragged
and
his
breath
had
frozen
in
icicles
on
his
stubby
red
beard
behind
him
came
a
boy
no
larger
than
keith
but
with
a
hard
shrewd
look
in
his
hungry
little
face
that
made
one
feel
he
had
lived
a
long
time
and
learned
more
than
was
good
for
him
to
know
it
was
plain
to
be
seen
that
he
was
nearly
starved
and
suffering
from
the
intense
cold
his
bare
toes
peeped
through
their
ragged
shoes
and
he
had
no
coat
a
thin
cotton
shirt
and
a
piece
of
an
old
gray
was
all
that
protected
his
shoulders
from
the
icy
wind
of
that
february
afternoon
he
too
crept
in
noiselessly
as
if
expecting
to
be
ordered
out
at
the
first
sound
and
then
turned
to
coax
in
some
animal
that
was
tied
to
one
end
of
the
rope
which
he
held
malcolm
and
keith
looked
on
with
interest
and
sprang
up
excitedly
as
the
animal
finally
shuffled
in
far
enough
for
the
boy
to
close
the
door
behind
it
it
was
a
great
shaggy
bear
taller
than
the
man
when
it
sat
up
on
its
haunches
beside
him
the
tramp
looked
uneasily
around
the
room
for
an
instant
but
seeing
no
one
save
the
two
children
ventured
nearer
the
stove
the
boy
followed
him
and
the
bear
shuffled
along
behind
them
both
limping
painfully
not
a
word
was
said
for
a
moment
the
boys
were
casting
curious
glances
at
the
three
tramps
who
had
come
in
as
noiselessly
as
if
they
had
snowed
down
and
the
man
was
watching
the
boys
with
shrewd
eyes
he
did
not
seem
to
be
looking
at
them
but
at
the
end
of
his
survey
he
could
have
described
them
accurately
he
had
noticed
every
detail
of
their
clothing
from
their
expensive
leather
leggins
to
their
gloves
he
glanced
at
malcolm
and
the
fine
skates
which
keith
swung
back
and
forth
by
a
strap
and
made
up
his
mind
correctly
too
that
the
pockets
of
these
boys
rarely
lacked
the
jingle
of
money
which
they
could
spend
as
they
pleased
when
he
turned
away
to
hold
his
hands
out
toward
the
stove
he
rubbed
them
together
with
satisfaction
for
he
had
discovered
more
than
that
he
knew
from
their
faces
that
they
were
trusting
little
souls
who
would
believe
any
story
he
might
tell
them
if
he
appealed
to
their
sympathies
in
the
right
way
he
was
considering
how
to
begin
when
malcolm
broke
the
silence
is
that
a
trained
bear
the
man
nodded
what
can
it
do
was
the
next
question
oh
lots
of
things
answered
the
man
in
a
low
whining
voice
drill
like
a
soldier
and
dance
and
ride
a
stick
he
kept
his
shifty
eyes
turning
constantly
toward
the
door
as
if
afraid
some
one
might
overhear
him
i
put
him
through
his
paces
for
you
young
he
said
but
he
got
his
foot
hurt
for
one
thing
and
another
is
if
we
went
to
showing
off
we
might
be
ordered
to
move
on
this
is
the
first
time
we
smelled
a
fire
in
hours
and
we
ai
in
no
hurry
to
leave
it
i
can
tell
you
will
he
bite
asked
keith
going
up
to
the
huge
bear
which
had
stretched
itself
out
comfortably
on
the
floor
not
generally
he
a
brute
most
times
like
a
lamb
but
he
ai
had
nothing
to
eat
all
day
so
it
would
be
surprising
if
he
was
a
bit
snappish
nothing
to
eat
echoed
keith
you
poor
old
thing
going
a
step
closer
he
put
out
his
hand
and
stroked
the
bear
as
if
it
had
been
a
great
dog
oh
malcolm
just
feel
how
soft
his
fur
is
like
mamma
beaver
jacket
and
he
has
the
kindest
old
face
poor
old
fellow
is
you
hungry
never
mind
keith
get
you
something
to
eat
pretty
soon
putting
his
short
plump
arms
around
the
animal
neck
he
hugged
it
lovingly
up
to
him
a
cunning
gleam
came
into
the
man
eyes
he
saw
that
he
had
gained
the
younger
boy
sympathy
and
he
wanted
malcolm
also
is
your
home
near
here
my
little
he
asked
in
a
friendly
tone
no
we
live
in
the
city
answered
malcolm
but
my
place
where
we
are
staying
is
not
far
from
here
he
was
stroking
the
bear
with
one
hand
as
he
spoke
and
hunting
in
his
pocket
with
the
other
hoping
to
find
some
stray
peanuts
to
give
it
then
maybe
you
know
of
some
place
where
we
could
stay
even
a
shed
to
crawl
into
would
keep
us
from
freezing
it
an
awful
cold
night
not
to
have
a
roof
over
your
head
or
a
crust
to
gnaw
on
or
a
spark
of
fire
to
keep
life
in
your
body
maybe
they
let
you
stay
in
the
suggested
malcolm
it
is
always
good
and
warm
in
here
i
ask
the
he
a
friend
of
mine
oh
no
no
do
exclaimed
the
tramp
hastily
pulling
his
old
hat
farther
over
his
forehead
as
if
to
hide
the
scar
and
looking
uneasily
around
i
would
have
you
do
that
for
anything
i
had
dealings
with
such
folks
before
and
i
know
how
they
treat
i
thought
maybe
there
was
a
barn
or
a
or
something
on
your
place
where
we
could
lay
up
for
repairs
a
couple
of
days
the
beast
needs
a
rest
its
foot
sore
and
jonesy
there
is
pretty
near
to
lung
fever
judging
from
the
way
he
coughs
he
nodded
toward
the
boy
who
had
placed
his
chair
as
close
to
the
stove
as
possible
the
child
face
was
drawn
into
a
pucker
by
the
tingling
pains
in
his
feet
and
his
efforts
to
keep
from
coughing
malcolm
looked
at
him
steadily
he
had
read
about
boys
who
were
homeless
and
hungry
and
cold
but
he
had
never
really
understood
how
much
it
meant
to
be
all
that
this
was
the
first
time
in
his
ten
short
years
that
he
had
ever
come
close
to
real
poverty
he
had
seen
the
swarms
of
beggars
that
infest
such
cities
as
naples
and
rome
and
had
tossed
them
coppers
because
that
seemed
a
part
of
the
programme
in
travelling
he
had
not
really
felt
sorry
for
them
for
they
did
not
seem
to
mind
it
they
sat
on
the
steps
in
the
warm
italian
sunshine
and
waited
for
tourists
to
throw
them
money
as
comfortably
as
toads
sit
blinking
at
flies
but
this
was
different
a
wave
of
pity
swept
through
generous
little
heart
as
he
looked
at
jonesy
and
the
man
watching
him
shrewdly
saw
it
of
course
he
whined
a
little
like
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
go
from
town
to
town
and
have
every
door
shut
in
your
face
you
do
think
that
this
is
a
stingy
old
world
because
it
has
given
you
the
cream
of
everything
but
if
you
never
had
anything
all
your
life
but
other
people
scraps
and
leavings
and
you
had
any
home
or
friends
or
money
and
was
sick
besides
you
think
things
was
very
evenly
divided
would
you
now
you
think
it
right
that
some
should
have
all
that
heart
can
wish
and
others
not
enough
to
keep
soul
and
body
together
if
you
to
be
jonesy
and
jonesy
had
to
been
you
i
reckon
you
feel
it
was
pretty
tough
to
see
such
a
big
difference
between
you
it
does
seem
fair
now
does
it
no
admitted
malcolm
faintly
he
had
taken
a
dislike
to
the
man
he
could
not
have
told
why
but
his
child
instinct
armed
him
with
a
sudden
distrust
still
he
felt
the
force
of
the
whining
appeal
and
the
burden
of
an
obligation
to
help
them
seemed
laid
upon
his
shoulders
grandmother
is
afraid
for
anybody
to
sleep
in
the
barn
on
account
of
fire
he
said
after
a
moment
thought
and
i
sure
she
would
let
you
come
into
the
house
without
you
had
a
bath
and
some
clean
clothes
grandmother
is
dreadfully
particular
he
added
hastily
not
wanting
to
be
impolite
even
to
a
tramp
seems
to
me
keith
and
i
have
to
spend
half
our
time
washing
our
hands
and
putting
on
clean
collars
oh
i
know
a
place
cried
keith
there
that
empty
cabin
down
by
the
nobody
has
lived
in
it
since
the
new
servants
cottage
was
built
there
is
any
furniture
in
it
but
there
a
fireplace
in
one
room
and
it
would
be
warmer
than
the
barn
that
just
the
trick
exclaimed
malcolm
we
can
carry
a
pile
of
hay
over
from
the
barn
for
you
to
sleep
on
aunt
allison
will
be
out
on
this
next
train
and
i
ask
her
i
am
sure
she
will
let
you
because
last
night
when
it
was
so
cold
she
said
she
felt
sorry
for
anything
that
had
to
be
out
in
it
even
the
poor
old
cedar
trees
with
the
sleet
on
their
branches
she
said
that
it
was
king
lear
own
weather
and
she
could
understand
how
cordelia
felt
when
she
said
enemy
dog
though
he
had
bit
me
should
have
stood
that
night
against
my
fire
it
is
just
like
auntie
to
feel
that
way
about
it
only
she
so
good
to
everybody
she
could
have
any
enemies
something
like
a
smile
moved
the
tramp
stubby
beard
so
she
that
kind
is
she
well
if
she
could
have
a
soft
spot
for
a
dog
that
had
bit
her
and
an
enemy
dog
at
that
it
stands
to
reason
that
she
object
to
some
harmless
travellers
in
an
empty
cabin
a
couple
of
nights
you
show
us
the
place
sonny
and
we
be
moving
on
oh
it
would
be
right
not
to
ask
her
first
exclaimed
malcolm
she
be
here
in
such
a
little
while
the
man
looked
uneasy
presently
he
walked
over
to
the
window
and
scraped
a
on
the
frosted
pane
with
his
dirty
thumbnail
down
he
said
i
like
to
get
that
bear
foot
fixed
comfortable
before
it
grows
any
darker
i
like
to
mighty
well
it
take
some
time
to
heat
water
to
dress
it
is
that
cabin
far
from
here
not
if
we
go
in
at
the
back
of
the
place
said
malcolm
it
just
across
the
meadow
and
over
a
little
hill
if
we
went
around
by
the
big
front
gate
it
would
be
a
good
deal
longer
the
man
shifted
uneasily
from
one
foot
to
another
and
complained
of
being
hungry
he
was
growing
desperate
for
more
reasons
than
one
he
did
not
want
to
be
at
the
station
when
the
train
came
in
that
long
red
scar
across
his
face
had
been
described
a
number
of
times
in
the
newspapers
and
he
did
not
care
to
be
recognised
just
then
the
boys
could
not
have
told
how
it
came
about
but
in
a
few
minutes
they
were
leading
the
way
toward
the
cabin
the
man
had
persuaded
them
that
it
was
not
at
all
necessary
to
wait
for
their
aunt
permission
and
that
it
was
needless
to
trouble
their
grandmother
why
should
the
ladies
be
bothered
about
a
matter
that
the
boys
were
old
enough
to
decide
so
well
had
he
argued
and
so
tactfully
had
he
flattered
them
that
when
they
took
their
way
across
the
field
it
was
with
the
feeling
that
they
were
doing
their
highest
duty
in
getting
these
homeless
wayfarers
to
the
cabin
as
quickly
as
possible
on
their
own
responsibility
illustration
across
the
snowy
fields
we
can
get
back
in
time
to
meet
the
train
if
we
hurry
said
malcolm
looking
at
his
watch
again
there
still
fifteen
minutes
no
one
saw
the
little
procession
file
out
of
the
and
across
the
snowy
field
for
it
was
growing
dark
and
the
lamps
were
lighted
and
the
curtains
drawn
in
the
few
houses
they
passed
malcolm
went
first
proudly
leading
the
friendly
old
bear
jonesy
came
next
beside
keith
and
the
man
shuffled
along
in
the
rear
looking
around
with
suspicious
glances
whenever
a
twig
snapped
or
a
distant
dog
barked
as
the
wind
struck
against
jonesy
body
he
drew
the
bit
of
blanket
more
closely
around
him
and
coughed
hoarsely
his
teeth
were
chattering
and
his
lips
blue
you
look
nearly
frozen
said
keith
who
and
scarcely
felt
the
cold
here
put
this
on
or
you
be
sick
unbuttoning
his
thick
little
reefer
he
pulled
it
off
and
tied
its
sleeves
around
jonesy
neck
a
strange
look
passed
over
the
face
of
the
man
behind
them
blessed
if
the
little
kid
did
take
it
off
his
own
back
he
muttered
if
any
man
had
ever
done
that
for
me
just
once
well
maybe
i
would
been
what
i
am
now
for
a
moment
as
they
reached
the
top
of
the
hill
bear
boys
and
man
were
outlined
blackly
against
the
sky
like
strange
silhouettes
then
they
passed
over
and
disappeared
in
the
thick
clump
of
which
hid
the
little
cabin
from
the
eyes
of
the
surrounding

steaming
in

when
keith
came
in
with
a
pitiful
tale
of
a
tramp
who
was
starving
at
their
very
gates
she
gave
him
even
more
than
he
asked
for
and
almost
more
than
he
could
carry
the
bear
and
its
masters
were
so
hungry
and
their
two
little
hosts
so
interested
in
watching
them
eat
that
they
forgot
all
about
going
back
to
meet
the
train
they
did
not
even
hear
it
whistle
when
it
came
puffing
into
the
valley
as
miss
allison
stepped
from
the
car
to
the
station
platform
she
looked
around
in
vain
for
the
boys
who
had
promised
to
meet
her
her
arms
were
so
full
of
bundles
as
suburban
passengers
usually
are
that
she
could
not
hold
up
her
long
broadcloth
skirt
or
even
turn
her
handsome
fur
collar
higher
over
her
ears
with
a
shade
of
annoyance
on
her
pretty
face
she
swept
across
the
platform
and
into
the
out
of
the
cold
behind
her
came
a
little
girl
about
ten
years
old
as
unlike
her
as
possible
although
it
was
virginia
dudley
ambition
to
be
exactly
like
her
aunt
allison
she
wanted
to
be
tall
and
slender
and
grown
up
miss
allison
was
that
and
yet
she
had
kept
all
her
lively
girlish
ways
and
a
love
of
fun
that
made
her
charming
to
everybody
young
and
old
virginia
longed
for
wavy
brown
hair
and
white
hands
and
especially
for
a
graceful
easy
manner
her
hair
was
short
and
black
and
her
complexion
like
a
gypsy
she
had
hard
brown
little
fists
sharp
gray
eyes
that
seemed
to
see
everything
at
once
and
a
tongue
that
was
always
getting
her
into
trouble
as
for
the
ease
of
manner
that
might
come
in
time
but
her
stately
old
grandmother
often
sighed
in
secret
over
virginia
awkwardness
she
stumbled
now
as
she
followed
the
young
lady
into
the
her
big
hat
tipped
over
one
ear
but
she
too
had
so
many
bundles
that
she
could
not
spare
a
hand
to
straighten
it
well
virginia
what
do
you
suppose
has
become
of
the
boys
asked
her
aunt
they
promised
to
meet
us
and
carry
our
packages
i
heard
them
in
here
about
half
an
hour
ago
miss
allison
said
the
who
had
come
in
with
a
lantern
i
they
got
tired
of
waiting
better
leave
your
things
here
had
you
i
watch
them
it
is
mighty
slippery
walking
this
evening
oh
thank
you
mason
she
answered
beginning
to
pile
boxes
and
packages
upon
a
bench
i
send
pete
down
for
them
immediately
now
virginia
turn
up
your
coat
collar
and
hold
your
muff
over
your
nose
or
jack
frost
will
make
an
icicle
out
of
you
before
you
are
home
they
had
been
in
the
house
some
time
before
the
boys
remembered
their
promise
to
meet
them
at
the
station
when
they
saw
how
late
it
was
they
started
home
on
the
run
i
am
fairly
aching
to
tell
ginger
about
that
bear
panted
keith
as
they
reached
the
side
door
i
am
so
sorry
that
we
promised
the
man
not
to
say
anything
about
them
being
on
the
place
before
he
sees
us
again
i
wonder
why
he
asked
us
that
i
do
know
answered
malcolm
he
seemed
to
have
some
very
good
reason
and
he
talked
about
it
so
that
it
did
seem
right
not
to
promise
a
little
thing
like
that
i
wish
we
had
though
said
keith
again
but
it
done
now
persisted
malcolm
we
bound
not
to
tell
and
you
ca
get
out
of
it
for
he
made
us
give
him
our
word
the
honour
of
a
gentleman
and
that
settles
it
you
know
they
were
two
very
dirty
boys
who
clattered
up
the
back
stairs
and
raced
to
their
room
to
dress
for
dinner
their
clothes
were
covered
with
hayseed
and
straw
and
their
hands
and
faces
were
black
with
soot
from
the
old
cabin
chimney
they
had
both
helped
to
build
the
fire
the
lamps
had
just
been
lighted
in
the
upper
hall
and
virginia
came
running
out
from
her
room
when
she
heard
the
boys
voices
why
did
you
meet
us
at
the
train
she
began
but
stopped
as
she
saw
their
dirty
faces
where
on
earth
have
you
been
she
cried
oh
about
and
about
answered
malcolm
teasingly
do
you
wish
you
knew
virginia
shrugged
her
shoulders
as
if
she
had
not
the
slightest
interest
in
the
matter
and
held
out
two
packages
here
are
the
valentines
you
sent
for
you
just
ought
to
see
the
pile
that
aunt
allison
bought
we
the
best
secret
about
that
ever
was
so
have
we
began
keith
but
malcolm
clapped
a
sooty
hand
over
his
mouth
and
pulled
him
toward
the
door
of
their
room
come
on
he
said
we
barely
time
to
dress
for
dinner
do
you
know
enough
to
keep
still
you
little
magpie
he
exclaimed
as
the
door
banged
behind
them
the
only
way
to
keep
a
secret
is
not
to
act
like
you
have
one
virginia
walked
slowly
back
to
her
room
and
paused
in
the
doorway
wondering
what
she
could
do
to
amuse
herself
until
it
was
a
queer
room
for
a
girl
decorated
with
flags
and
indian
trophies
and
everything
that
could
remind
her
of
the
military
life
she
loved
at
the
army
post
there
were
photographs
framed
in
brass
buttons
on
her
and
pictures
of
uniformed
officers
all
over
the
walls
a
canteen
and
an
army
cap
with
a
through
the
crown
hung
over
her
desk
and
a
battered
bugle
that
had
sounded
many
a
triumphant
charge
swung
from
the
corner
of
her
mirror
each
souvenir
had
a
history
and
had
been
given
her
at
parting
by
some
special
friend
every
one
at
the
fort
had
made
a
pet
of
captain
daughter
the
little
ginger
who
would
rather
dash
across
the
prairies
on
her
pony
like
a
wild
comanche
indian
than
play
with
the
finest
doll
ever
imported
from
paris
there
was
a
suit
in
her
wardrobe
short
skirt
jacket
leggins
and
moccasins
all
made
and
beaded
by
the
squaws
it
was
the
gift
of
the
colonel
wife
dudley
had
hesitated
some
time
before
putting
it
in
one
of
the
trunks
that
was
to
go
back
to
kentucky
you
look
so
much
like
an
indian
now
she
said
to
virginia
your
face
is
so
sunburned
that
i
am
afraid
your
grandmother
will
be
scandalised
i
do
know
what
she
would
say
if
she
knew
that
i
ever
allowed
you
to
run
so
wild
if
i
had
known
that
you
were
going
back
to
civilisation
i
certainly
should
not
have
kept
your
hair
cut
short
and
you
should
have
worn
sunbonnets
all
summer
to
dudley
great
surprise
her
little
daughter
threw
herself
into
her
arms
sobbing
oh
mamma
i
do
want
to
go
back
to
kentucky
take
me
to
cuba
with
you
please
do
or
else
let
me
stay
here
at
the
post
everybody
will
take
care
of
me
here
i
just
if
you
leave
me
in
kentucky
why
darling
she
said
soothingly
as
she
wiped
her
tears
away
and
rocked
her
back
and
forth
in
her
arms
i
thought
you
have
always
wanted
to
see
mamma
old
home
and
the
places
you
have
heard
so
much
about
there
are
all
the
old
toys
in
the
nursery
that
we
had
when
we
were
children
and
the
swing
in
the
orchard
and
the
where
we
fished
and
the
where
we
had
such
delightful
picnics
i
thought
it
would
be
so
nice
for
you
to
do
all
the
same
things
that
made
me
so
happy
when
i
was
a
child
and
go
to
school
in
the
same
old
girls
college
and
know
all
the
dear
old
neighbours
that
i
knew
would
my
little
girl
like
that
oh
yes
some
i
sobbed
virginia
but
i
did
know
i
have
to
be
so
so
everlastingly
civilised
she
wailed
i
do
want
to
always
have
to
dress
just
so
and
have
to
walk
in
a
path
and
be
called
virginia
all
the
time
that
sounds
so
stiff
and
proper
i
rather
stay
where
people
do
mind
if
i
am
sunburned
and
tanned
and
wo
be
scandalised
at
everything
i
do
it
so
much
nicer
to
be
just
plain
ginger
it
had
been
five
months
now
since
virginia
left
fort
dennis
at
first
she
had
locked
hen
self
in
her
room
nearly
every
day
and
with
her
face
buried
in
her
indian
suit
cried
to
go
back
she
missed
the
gay
military
life
of
the
army
post
as
a
sailor
would
miss
the
sea
or
an
alpine
shepherd
the
free
air
of
his
mountain
heights
it
was
not
that
she
did
not
enjoy
being
at
her
grandmother
she
liked
the
great
gray
house
whose
square
corner
tower
and
vines
made
it
look
like
an
old
castle
she
liked
the
comfort
and
elegance
of
the
big
stately
rooms
and
she
had
her
grandmother
own
pride
in
the
old
family
portraits
and
the
beautiful
carved
furniture
the
negro
servants
seemed
so
queer
and
funny
to
her
that
she
found
them
a
great
source
of
amusement
and
her
aunt
allison
planned
so
many
pleasant
occupations
outside
of
that
she
scarcely
had
time
to
get
lonesome
but
she
had
a
feeling
like
a
wild
bird
in
a
cage
and
sometimes
the
longing
for
liberty
which
her
mother
had
allowed
her
made
her
fret
against
the
thousand
little
proprieties
she
had
to
observe
sometimes
when
she
went
tipping
over
the
polished
floors
of
the
long
drawing
room
and
caught
sight
of
herself
in
one
of
the
big
mirrors
she
felt
that
she
was
not
herself
at
all
but
somebody
in
a
story
the
virginia
in
the
seemed
so
very
very
civilised
more
than
once
after
one
of
these
meetings
with
herself
in
the
mirror
she
dashed
locked
her
door
and
dressed
herself
in
her
indian
suit
then
in
her
noiseless
moccasins
she
danced
the
wildest
of
whispering
shrilly
between
her
teeth
now
i
ginger
now
i
ginger
and
i
be
dressed
up
and
i
learn
my
lessons
and
i
be
a
little
lady
and
i
run
away
and
go
back
to
fort
dennis
the
very
first
chance
i
get
usually
she
was
ashamed
of
these
outbursts
afterwards
for
it
always
happened
that
after
each
one
she
found
her
aunt
allison
had
planned
something
especially
pleasant
for
her
entertainment
miss
allison
felt
sorry
for
the
lonely
child
who
had
never
been
separated
from
her
father
and
mother
before
so
she
devoted
her
time
to
her
as
much
as
possible
telling
her
stories
and
entering
into
her
plays
and
pleasures
as
if
they
had
both
been
the
same
age
since
the
boys
had
come
virginia
had
not
had
a
single
homesick
moment
while
she
was
at
school
in
the
primary
department
of
the
college
malcolm
and
keith
were
reciting
their
lessons
to
the
old
minister
who
lived
across
the
road
from
macintyre
they
were
all
free
about
the
same
hour
and
even
on
the
coldest
days
played
from
until
dark
virginia
had
so
many
experiences
to
tell
them
of
her
day
in
town
that
the
boys
seemed
unusually
long
in
dressing
she
was
so
impatient
for
them
to
hear
her
news
that
she
could
not
settle
down
to
anything
but
walked
restlessly
around
the
room
wishing
they
would
hurry
oh
i
have
sorted
my
valentines
she
exclaimed
presently
picking
up
a
fancy
box
which
she
had
tossed
on
the
bed
when
she
first
came
in
i
take
them
down
to
the
library
there
was
no
one
in
the
room
when
she
peeped
in
it
looked
so
bright
and
cosy
with
the
great
wood
fire
blazing
on
the
hearth
and
the
light
falling
from
its
softly
shaded
lamps
that
she
forgot
the
coldness
of
the
night
outside
sitting
down
on
a
pile
of
cushions
at
one
end
of
the
she
began
sorting
her
purchases
trying
to
decide
to
whom
each
one
should
be
sent
the
prettiest
valentine
of
all
must
go
to
poor
papa
she
said
to
herself
he
been
so
sick
away
down
there
in
cuba
and
this
one
that
got
the
little
girl
on
it
in
a
blue
dress
shall
be
for
my
dear
sweet
mamma
it
will
make
her
think
of
me
for
a
moment
a
mist
seemed
to
blur
the
gay
blue
dress
of
the
little
valentine
girl
as
virginia
looked
at
her
thinking
of
her
mother
she
drew
her
hand
hastily
across
her
eyes
and
went
on
this
one
is
for
sergeant
jackson
out
at
fort
dennis
and
the
biggest
one
with
the
doves
for
colonel
philips
and
his
wife
dear
me
i
wish
i
could
send
one
to
every
officer
and
soldier
out
there
they
were
all
good
to
me
the
pile
of
cupids
and
hearts
and
arrows
and
roses
slipped
from
her
lap
down
to
the
rug
as
she
clasped
her
hands
around
her
knees
and
looked
into
the
fire
she
wished
that
she
could
be
back
again
at
the
fort
long
enough
to
live
one
of
those
beautiful
old
days
from
reveille
to
taps
how
she
loved
the
and
the
wild
thrill
the
band
gave
her
when
it
struck
up
a
burst
of
martial
music
and
the
troops
went
dashing
by
how
she
missed
the
drills
and
the
dress
parades
her
rides
across
the
open
prairie
on
her
pony
beside
her
father
how
she
missed
the
games
she
used
to
play
with
the
other
children
at
the
fort
on
the
long
summer
evenings
something
more
than
a
mist
was
gathering
in
her
eyes
now
two
big
tears
were
almost
ready
to
fall
when
the
door
opened
and
macintyre
came
in
in
virginia
eyes
she
was
the
most
beautiful
grandmother
any
one
ever
had
she
was
not
so
tall
as
her
daughter
allison
and
in
that
respect
fell
short
of
the
little
girl
ideal
but
her
hair
white
as
snow
curled
around
her
face
in
the
same
soft
pretty
fashion
and
by
every
refined
feature
she
showed
her
kinship
to
the
aristocratic
old
faces
which
looked
down
from
the
family
portraits
in
the
hall
i
could
be
as
stately
and
dignified
as
she
is
if
i
practised
a
thousand
years
thought
virginia
scrambling
up
from
the
pile
of
cushions
to
roll
a
chair
nearer
the
fire
as
she
did
so
her
heel
caught
in
the
rug
and
she
fell
back
in
an
awkward
little
heap
the
more
haste
the
less
grace
my
dear
said
her
grandmother
kindly
thanking
her
for
the
proffered
chair
virginia
blushed
wondering
why
she
always
appeared
so
awkward
in
her
grandmother
presence
she
envied
the
boys
because
they
never
seemed
embarrassed
or
ill
at
ease
before
her
while
she
was
picking
up
her
valentines
the
boys
came
in
if
two
of
the
cavalier
ancestors
had
stepped
down
from
their
portrait
frames
just
then
they
could
not
have
come
into
the
room
in
a
more
charming
manner
than
malcolm
and
keith
their
faces
were
shining
their
linen
spotless
and
they
came
up
to
kiss
their
grandmother
cheek
with
an
courtliness
that
delighted
her
i
am
sure
that
there
are
no
more
perfect
gentlemen
in
all
kentucky
than
my
two
little
lads
she
said
fondly
with
an
approving
pat
of
hand
as
she
held
him
a
moment
virginia
who
had
seen
them
half
an
hour
before
tousled
and
dirty
and
had
been
arrayed
against
them
in
more
than
one
hot
quarrel
where
they
had
been
anything
but
chivalrous
let
slip
a
faintly
whistled
the
boys
darted
a
quick
glance
in
her
direction
but
she
was
bending
over
the
valentines
with
a
very
serious
face
which
never
changed
its
expression
till
her
aunt
allison
came
in
and
the
boys
began
their
apologies
for
not
meeting
her
at
the
train
their
only
excuse
was
that
they
had
forgotten
all
about
it
virginia
spelled
on
her
fingers
i
dare
you
to
tell
what
made
your
faces
so
black
keith
only
answer
was
to
thrust
his
tongue
out
at
her
behind
his
grandmother
back
then
he
ran
to
hold
the
door
open
for
the
ladies
to
pass
out
to
dinner
with
all
the
grace
of
a
young
chesterfield
when
dinner
was
over
and
they
were
back
in
the
library
miss
allison
opened
a
box
of
tiny
envelopes
and
began
addressing
them
as
she
took
up
her
pen
she
said
merrily
you
may
tell
our
secret
virginia
i
was
going
to
make
you
guess
for
about
an
hour
said
virginia
but
it
is
so
nice
i
ca
wait
that
long
to
tell
you
we
are
going
to
have
a
valentine
party
night
aunt
allison
planned
it
all
a
week
ago
and
bought
the
things
for
it
while
we
were
in
town
everything
on
the
table
is
to
be
cut
in
heart
shape
the
bread
and
butter
and
sandwiches
and
cheese
and
the
will
be
moulded
in
hearts
and
the
two
big
frosted
cakes
are
hearts
one
pink
and
one
white
with
candy
arrows
sticking
in
them
then
there
will
be
peppermint
candy
hearts
with
mottoes
printed
on
them
and
napkins
with
verses
on
them
so
that
the
table
itself
will
look
like
a
lovely
big
valentine
the
games
are
lovely
too
one
is
parlour
archery
with
a
red
heart
in
the
middle
of
the
target
and
two
prizes
one
for
the
boys
and
one
for
the
girls
who
are
invited
asked
malcolm
as
virginia
stopped
for
breath
oh
the
carrington
boys
and
the
edmunds
and
sally
fairfax
and
julia
ferris
i
ca
remember
them
all
there
will
be
counting
us
there
is
the
list
on
the
table
keith
reached
for
it
and
began
slowly
spelling
out
the
names
who
is
this
he
asked
reading
the
name
that
headed
the
list
little
colonel
i
never
heard
of
him
oh
he
a
girl
laughed
virginia
little
lloyd
sherman
do
you
know
she
lives
up
at
locusts
that
lovely
place
with
the
long
avenue
of
trees
leading
up
to
the
house
you
surely
seen
her
with
her
grandfather
old
colonel
lloyd
riding
by
on
the
horse
that
he
calls
maggie
boy
has
he
only
one
arm
asked
malcolm
yes
the
other
was
shot
off
in
the
war
years
ago
well
when
lloyd
was
younger
she
had
a
temper
so
much
like
his
and
wore
such
a
dear
little
napoleon
hat
that
everybody
took
to
calling
her
the
little
colonel
how
old
is
she
now
asked
malcolm
about
keith
age
is
she
aunt
allison
asked
virginia
yes
was
the
answer
she
is
nearly
eight
i
believe
she
has
outgrown
most
of
her
naughtiness
now
i
love
to
hear
her
talk
said
virginia
she
leaves
out
all
of
her
in
such
a
soft
sweet
way
all
southerners
do
that
said
malcolm
pompously
and
i
think
it
sounds
lots
better
than
the
way
yankees
talk
you
boys
do
talk
like
the
little
colonel
retorted
virginia
who
had
often
been
teased
by
them
for
not
being
a
southerner
you
all
mixed
up
every
which
way
some
things
you
say
like
darkeys
and
some
things
like
english
people
and
it
does
sound
a
bit
like
the
little
colonel
oh
well
that
because
we
travelled
abroad
so
much
do
you
know
drawled
malcolm
and
we
been
in
so
many
different
countries
and
had
an
english
tutor
and
all
that
sort
of
a
thing
we
could
help
picking
up
a
bit
of
an
accent
do
you
know
his
superior
tone
made
virginia
long
to
slap
him
yes
i
know
mr
brag
she
said
in
such
a
low
voice
that
her
grandmother
could
not
hear
i
know
perfectly
well
if
i
did
it
would
be
because
you
have
told
me
every
chance
you
got
who
did
you
say
is
your
tailor
in
london
and
how
many
times
was
it
the
queen
invited
you
out
to
windsor
i
think
it
a
dollar
cravat
you
always
buy
is
it
and
you
would
be
so
common
as
to
wear
a
pair
of
gloves
that
had
been
made
to
order
specially
for
you
yes
i
heard
all
about
it
miss
allison
heard
but
said
nothing
she
knew
the
boys
were
a
little
inclined
to
boast
and
she
thought
virginia
sharp
tongue
might
have
a
good
effect
but
the
retort
had
grown
somewhat
sharper
than
was
pleasant
and
fearing
a
quarrel
might
follow
if
she
did
not
interrupt
the
whispers
beside
her
she
said
boys
did
you
ever
hear
about
the
time
that
the
little
colonel
threw
mud
on
her
grandfather
coat
there
no
end
to
her
pranks
get
grandmother
to
tell
you
oh
yes
please
grandmother
begged
keith
with
an
arm
around
her
neck

said
virginia

malcolm

down
before
breakfast
exclaimed
keith
springing
out
of
bed
and
beginning
to
dress
himself
a
little
while
later
the
old
coloured
coachman
saw
them
run
past
the
window
where
he
was
warming
himself
by
the
kitchen
stove
daphne
he
called
out
to
the
cook
who
was

in

adjoining

into
filling
a
basket
with
a
generous
supply
of
cold
victuals
pretended
not
to

until
he
repeated
his
question
then
she
stopped
pounding
long
enough
to
say
sharply
whuffo

daphne
had
seen
them
setting
rabbit
traps
there
but
she
knew
well
enough
that
was
not
what
they
had
gone
for
now
and
that
the
food
they
carried
was
not
for
the
game
of
robinson
crusoe
which
they
had
played
in
the
deserted
cabin
the
summer
before
still
she
did
not
care
to
take
unc
henry
into
her
confidence
the
food
the
warmth
and
the
night
rest
had
so
restored
the
bear
that
it
was
able
to
go
through
all
its
performances
for
the
entertainment
although
it
limped
badly
is
he
a
dandy
cried
keith
i
wish
we
had
one
it
nicer
than
any
pets
we
ever
had
except
the
ponies
something
always
happened
to
the
dogs
and
the
monkey
was
such
a
nuisance
and
the
white
rabbits
were
stolen
and
the
guinea
pigs
died
have
we
had
a
lot
of
things
when
you
come
to
think
of
it
exclaimed
malcolm
squirrels
and
white
mice
and
the
coon
that
uncle
harry
brought
us
and
the
parrot
from
mexico
yes
and
the
and
the
little
baby
alligator
that
froze
to
death
in
its
tank
added
keith
but
a
bear
like
this
would
be
nicer
than
any
of
them
as
soon
as
papa
comes
home
i
am
going
to
ask
him
to
buy
us
one
jonesy
nearly
done
for
said
the
tramp
pointing
to
the
boy
who
lay
curled
up
in
the
hay
coughing
at
nearly
every
breath
we
ought
to
stay
here
another
day
if
you
young
do
object
oh
goody
cried
keith
then
we
can
bring
ginger
down
to
see
the
bear
perform
yes
answered
the
man
we
give
a
free
show
to
all
your
friends
if
you
will
only
kindly
wait
till
give
us
one
more
day
to
rest
up
and
get
in
a
little
better
trim
the
poor
beast
foot
is
still
too
lame
for
him
to
do
his
best
and
you
too
i
am
sure
to
want
anything
to
suffer
in
order
to
give
you
pleasure
of
course
answered
both
the
boys
agreeing
so
quickly
to
all
the
man
smooth
speeches
that
before
they
left
the
cabin
they
had
renewed
their
promise
to
keep
silent
one
more
day
the
man
was
a
shrewd
one
and
knew
well
how
to
make
these
unsuspecting
little
souls
serve
his
purpose
like
puppets
tied
to
a
string
miss
allison
was
so
busy
with
preparations
for
the
party
that
she
had
no
time
all
that
day
to
notice
what
the
boys
were
doing
when
they
came
back
from
reciting
their
lessons
to
the
minister
she
sent
them
on
several
errands
but
the
rest
of
the
time
they
divided
between
the
cabin
and
the
every
mail
brought
a
few
valentines
to
each
of
them
but
it
was
not
until
the
five
train
came
that
they
found
the
letters
from
their
father
and
mother
i
knew
they
each
send
us
a
valentine
cried
keith
tearing
both
of
his
open
i
bet
that
papa
is
a
comic
one
yes
here
it
is
papa
is
such
a
tease
is
it
a
stunner
a
player
and
whoopee
here
a
dollar
bill
in
each
of
so
there
is
in
mine
said
malcolm
mamma
says
we
are
to
buy
anything
we
want
and
call
it
a
valentine
they
could
find
anything
down
on
the
coast
that
they
thought
we
would
like
i
do
know
what
to
get
with
mine
said
keith
folding
his
two
bills
together
seems
to
me
i
have
everything
i
want
except
a
camera
and
i
could
buy
the
kind
i
want
for
two
dollars
they
were
home
when
a
happy
thought
came
to
malcolm
keith
he
cried
excitedly
if
you
would
put
your
money
with
mine
that
would
make
four
dollars
and
maybe
it
would
be
enough
to
buy
that
bear
let
do
it
exclaimed
keith
turning
a
handspring
in
the
snow
to
show
his
delight
come
on
we
ask
the
man
now
but
the
man
shook
his
head
when
they
dashed
into
the
cabin
and
told
their
errand
no
sonny
that
ai
a
tenth
of
what
it
worth
to
me
he
said
i
raised
that
bear
from
the
time
it
was
a
teeny
cub
taught
it
and
fed
it
and
looked
to
it
for
company
when
i
had
nobody
in
the
world
to
care
for
me
could
sell
that
bear
for
no
such
sum
as
that
could
you
raise
any
more
money
than
that
it
was
malcolm
turn
to
shake
his
head
he
turned
away
too
disappointed
to
trust
himself
to
answer
any
other
way
the
tears
sprang
to
keith
eyes
he
had
set
his
heart
on
having
that
bear
never
mind
brother
said
malcolm
moving
toward
the
door
papa
will
get
us
one
when
he
comes
home
and
finds
how
much
we
want
one
oh
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
young
whined
the
man
when
he
saw
that
they
were
really
going
i
did
say
that
i
would
sell
it
to
you
for
that
much
you
been
so
kind
to
me
that
i
ought
to
be
willing
to
make
any
sacrifice
for
you
i
happen
to
need
four
dollars
very
particular
just
now
and
i
a
mind
to
sell
him
to
you
on
your
own
terms
he
paused
a
moment
looking
thoughtfully
at
a
crack
in
the
floor
as
he
stood
by
the
fire
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
yes
he
said
at
last
you
can
have
him
for
four
dollars
if
you
keep
mum
about
us
being
here
for
one
more
day
you
can
leave
the
bear
here
till
we
go
no
no
cried
keith
throwing
his
arms
around
the
animal
neck
he
is
ours
now
and
we
must
take
him
with
us
we
can
hide
him
away
in
the
barn
it
is
so
dark
now
that
nobody
will
see
us
it
seem
like
he
is
really
ours
if
we
could
take
him
with
us
after
some
grumbling
the
man
consented
and
pocketed
the
four
dollars
first
asking
very
particularly
the
exact
spot
in
the
barn
where
they
expected
to
hide
their
huge
pet
unc
henry
coming
up
from
the
through
the
twilight
thought
he
saw
some
one
stealing
along
by
the
clump
of
cedars
by
the
who
prowlin
roun
dis
yere
premises
he
called
there
was
no
answer
and
after
peering
intently
through
the
dusk
for
a
moment
the
old
darkey
concluded
that
he
must
have
been
mistaken
and
passed
on
as
soon
as
he
was
gone
the
boys
came
out
from
behind
the
cedars
and
crept
up
the
snowy
hillside
they
were
leading
the
bear
between
them
we
put
him
away
back
in
the
where
he
be
warm
and
comfortable
whispered
malcolm
then
in
the
morning
we
can
tell
everybody
while
they
were
busily
scooping
out
a
big
hollow
in
the
hay
they
were
startled
by
a
rustling
behind
them
they
looked
into
each
frightened
faces
and
then
glanced
around
the
dark
barn
in
alarm
an
old
cap
pushed
up
through
the
hay
then
a
weak
little
cough
betrayed
jonesy
he
had
followed
them
sh
he
said
in
a
warning
whisper
i
afraid
the
boss
will
find
out
that
i
here
he
started
to
the
store
for
some
tobacco
as
soon
as
you
left
he
been
wild
fer
some
but
did
have
no
money
you
leave
that
bear
out
here
if
you
ever
expect
to
see
it
again
that
was
true
what
he
told
you
he
never
saw
the
bear
till
two
months
ago
and
he
sold
it
to
you
cheap
because
he
to
steal
it
back
again
and
make
off
up
the
road
with
it
he
went
off
over
the
slick
way
he
fooled
you
and
i
jes
had
to
come
and
tell
you
been
so
good
to
me
i
never
forget
the
little
givin
me
the
coat
off
his
own
back
if
i
live
to
be
a
hundred
now
do
blab
on
me
or
the
boss
would
nearly
kill
me
is
that
man
your
father
began
keith
but
jonesy
alarmed
by
some
sudden
noise
sprang
to
the
door
and
disappeared
in
the
twilight
the
boys
looked
at
each
other
a
moment
with
surprise
and
indignation
in
their
faces
there
was
a
hurried
consultation
in
the
a
few
moments
later
the
boys
were
smuggling
their
new
pet
into
the
house
and
up
the
back
stairs
they
scarcely
dared
breathe
until
it
was
safe
in
their
own
room
all
the
time
that
they
were
dressing
for
the
party
they
were
trying
to
decide
where
to
put
it
for
the
night
so
that
neither
the
tramp
nor
the
family
could
discover
it
what
jonesy
had
told
them
about
the
dishonest
intention
did
not
relieve
them
from
their
promise
they
were
amazed
that
any
one
could
be
so
mean
and
longed
to
tell
their
aunt
allison
all
about
it
still
one
of
the
conditions
on
which
they
had
bought
the
bear
was
that
they
were
to
keep
mum
and
they
stuck
strictly
to
that
promise
by
the
time
they
were
dressed
they
had
decided
to
put
it
in
the
blue
room
a
in
the
north
wing
seldom
used
in
winter
because
it
was
so
hard
to
heat
nobody
will
ever
think
of
coming
in
here
said
malcolm
and
it
will
be
plenty
warm
for
a
bear
if
we
turn
on
the
furnace
a
little
as
he
spoke
he
was
tying
the
bear
rope
around
a
leg
of
the
big
bed
wo
ginger
be
surprised
answered
keith
we
tell
her
that
we
have
a
valentine
six
feet
long
and
keep
her
guessing
there
was
no
time
for
teasing
however
as
the
first
guest
arrived
while
they
were
still
in
the
blue
room
i
hate
to
go
off
and
leave
him
in
the
dark
said
keith
with
a
final
loving
pat
i
guess
he
not
mind
though
maybe
he
think
he
is
in
the
woods
if
i
put
this
pine
pillow
on
the
rug
beside
him
oh
boys
called
virginia
from
the
hall
see
what
an
enormous
valentine
pie
aunt
allison
has
made
looking
over
the
banisters
the
boys
saw
that
a
table
had
been
drawn
into
the
middle
of
the
wide
and
on
it
sat
the
largest
pie
that
they
had
ever
seen
it
was
in
a
bright
new
tin
pan
and
its
daintily
browned
crust
would
have
made
them
hungry
even
if
their
appetites
had
not
been
sharpened
by
the
cold
and
exercise
of
the
afternoon
what
a
queer
place
to
serve
pie
said
malcolm
in
a
disapproving
undertone
to
his
brother
why
do
they
have
it
in
the
it
looks
mighty
good
but
somehow
it
does
seem
proper
to
have
it
stuck
out
here
in
the
hall
mamma
would
never
do
such
a
thing
aw
it
made
of
paper
she
fooled
us
sure
malcolm
called
back
keith
who
had
run
on
ahead
to
look
it
is
only
painted
to
look
like
a
pie
but
is
it
a
splendid
imitation
virginia
pleased
to
have
caught
them
so
cleverly
showed
them
the
ends
of
pieces
of
narrow
ribbon
peeping
from
under
the
delicately
brown
top
crust
the
white
ones
are
for
the
girls
and
the
red
ones
for
the
boys
she
explained
there
is
a
valentine
on
the
end
of
each
one
and
those
on
the
red
ribbons
match
the
ones
on
the
white
we
all
pull
at
once
and
the
ones
who
have
valentines
alike
will
go
out
to
dinner
together
the
guests
came
promptly
they
had
been
invited
for
six
and
dinner
was
to
be
served
soon
after
that
time
the
last
to
arrive
was
the
little
colonel
she
came
in
charge
of
an
old
coloured
woman
mom
beck
who
had
been
her
mother
nurse
as
well
as
her
own
the
child
was
so
hidden
in
her
wraps
when
mom
beck
led
her
that
no
one
could
tell
how
she
looked
the
boys
had
been
curious
to
see
her
ever
since
they
had
heard
so
many
tales
of
her
mischievous
pranks
a
few
minutes
later
when
she
appeared
in
the
parlours
there
was
a
buzz
of
admiration
maybe
it
was
not
so
much
for
the
soft
light
hair
the
beauty
of
her
big
dark
eyes
or
the
delicate
colour
in
her
cheeks
that
made
them
as
pink
as
a
wild
rose
as
it
was
for
the
valentine
costume
she
wore
it
was
of
dainty
white
tulle
sprinkled
with
hundreds
of
tiny
red
velvet
hearts
and
there
was
a
coronet
of
glittering
rhinestones
on
her
long
fair
hair
the
queen
of
hearts
announced
aunt
allison
leading
her
forward
you
know
made
some
tarts
upon
a
summer
day
and
now
she
shall
open
the
valentine
pie
and
see
if
it
is
as
good
as
her
majesty
the
big
in
the
hall
began
playing
one
of
its
liveliest
waltzes
the
children
gathered
around
the
great
pie
and
little
hands
reached
out
to
grasp
the
floating
ends
of
ribbon
pull
cried
the
little
queen
of
hearts
the
paper
crust
flew
off
and
yards
of
ribbon
each
with
a
valentine
attached
fluttered
brightly
through
the
air
for
an
instant
now
match
your
verses
cried
her
majesty
again
opening
her
own
to
read
what
was
in
it
there
was
much
laughing
and
peeping
over
shoulders
and
tangling
of
white
and
scarlet
ribbons
while
the
gay
played
on
in
the
midst
of
it
virginia
beckoned
to
the
little
colonel
come
with
me
for
a
minute
lloyd
she
whispered
and
help
me
look
for
something
aunt
allison
has
forgotten
where
she
put
the
box
of
arrows
that
we
are
to
use
in
the
archery
contest
after
dinner
there
is
the
prettiest
prize
for
the
one
who
hits
the
red
heart
in
the
centre
of
the
target
oh
do
you
suppose
you
can
hit
it
asked
lloyd
as
she
and
virginia
slipped
their
arms
around
each
other
and
went
skipping
up
the
stairs
yes
indeed
answered
virginia
i
used
to
practise
so
much
with
my
indian
bow
and
arrow
out
at
the
fort
that
i
could
hit
centre
nearly
every
time
i
am
not
going
to
shoot
aunt
allison
thinks
it
would
be
fair
when
they
reached
the
top
of
the
stairs
virginia
went
into
her
room
to
light
a
wax
taper
in
one
of
the
tall
silver
candlesticks
on
her
i
think
that
aunt
allison
must
have
left
those
arrows
in
the
blue
room
she
said
leading
the
way
down
the
cross
hall
which
went
to
the
north
wing
she
made
the
pie
in
there
this
morning
and
all
the
other
things
were
there
nobody
comes
over
in
this
part
of
the
house
much
in
winter
unless
there
happens
to
be
a
great
deal
of
company
the
taper
that
virginia
carried
was
the
only
light
in
that
part
of
the
house
when
she
reached
the
door
of
the
blue
room
she
turned
to
lloyd
hold
the
candle
for
me
please
she
said
while
i
look
in
the
closet
it
was
a
pretty
picture
that
the
little
queen
of
hearts
made
as
she
stood
in
the
doorway
with
the
tall
silver
candlestick
held
high
in
both
hands
her
hair
shone
like
gold
in
the
candlelight
and
her
glittering
crown
flashed
as
if
a
circle
of
fairy
fireflies
had
been
caught
in
its
soft
meshes
her
dark
eyes
peered
anxiously
around
the
big
shadowy
room
lighted
only
by
her
flickering
taper
malcolm
and
keith
were
almost
quarrelling
about
her
it
began
by
malcolm
taking
his
brother
aside
and
offering
to
trade
valentines
with
him
why
asked
keith
suspiciously
yours
matches
the
little
colonel
and
i
want
to
take
her
out
to
dinner
admitted
malcolm
she
is
the
prettiest
girl
here
but
i
do
want
to
trade
answered
keith
i
want
to
take
her
myself
i
give
you
the
pick
of
any
six
stamps
in
my
album
if
you
will
do
want
your
old
stamps
declared
keith
stoutly
i
rather
have
the
little
colonel
for
my
partner
i
think
you
might
trade
coaxed
malcolm
it
mean
not
to
when
the
oldest
i
give
you
that
chinese
puzzle
you
been
wanting
so
long
if
you
will
keith
shook
his
head
just
then
a
terrific
scream
sounded
in
the
upper
hall
followed
by
another
that
made
every
one
turn
pale
with
fright
two
voices
were
uttering
piercing
shrieks
one
after
another
so
loud
and
frantic
that
even
the
servants
in
the
back
part
of
the
house
came
running
miss
allison
thinking
of
the
candle
she
had
told
virginia
to
light
and
remembering
the
thin
white
dress
the
child
wore
instantly
thought
she
must
have
set
herself
afire
she
ran
into
the
hall
so
frightened
that
she
was
trembling
from
head
to
foot
before
she
could
reach
the
staircase
virginia
came
flying
down
the
steps
white
as
a
little
ghost
and
her
eyes
wide
with
terror
throwing
herself
into
her
aunt
outstretched
arms
she
began
to
sob
out
her
story
between
great
trembling
gasps
oh
there
an
awful
awful
wild
beast
in
the
blue
room
nearly
as
tall
as
the
ceiling
it
rose
up
and
came
after
us
out
of
the
corner
and
if
i
had
slammed
the
door
just
in
time
it
would
have
eaten
us
up
sure
it
would
it
was
so
awful
she
wailed
why
virginia
exclaimed
her
aunt
distressed
to
see
her
so
terrified
it
must
have
been
only
a
big
shadow
you
saw
it
is
possible
for
a
wild
beast
to
be
in
the
blue
room
you
know
where
is
lloyd
she
up
heah
miss
allison
called
mom
beck
voice
she
so
skeered
she
gwine
to
faint
they
is
something
in
that
room
honey
deed
they
is
i
kin
heah
it
movin
around
now
switchin
he
tail
an
growlin
malcolm
and
keith
with
guilty
faces
went
dashing
up
the
stairs
and
the
whole
party
followed
them
at
a
respectful
distance
when
they
opened
the
door
the
room
looked
very
big
and
shadowy
and
the
bear
roused
from
its
nap
was
standing
on
its
hind
legs
beside
the
bed
the
huge
figure
was
certainly
enough
to
frighten
any
one
coming
upon
it
unexpectedly
in
the
dark
and
when
miss
allison
saw
it
she
drew
virginia
trembling
hand
into
hers
with
a
sympathetic
clasp
before
she
could
ask
any
questions
the
boys
began
an
excited
explanation
it
was
some
time
before
they
could
make
their
story
understood
their
grandmother
was
horrified
and
insisted
on
sending
the
animal
away
at
once
the
idea
of
bringing
such
a
dangerous
creature
into
any
house
she
exclaimed
and
above
all
of
shutting
him
up
in
a
bedroom
we
might
have
all
been
bitten
or
hugged
to
death
but
grandmother
begged
malcolm
he
is
dangerous
let
me
bring
him
into
the
light
and
show
you
what
a
kind
old
pet
he
is
there
was
a
scattering
to
the
other
end
of
the
hall
as
malcolm
came
out
leading
the
bear
but
the
children
gradually
drew
nearer
as
the
great
animal
began
its
performances
keith
whistled
and
kept
time
with
his
feet
in
a
funny
little
shuffling
jig
he
had
learned
from
jonesy
and
the
bear
obligingly
went
through
all
his
tricks
he
was
used
to
being
pulled
out
to
perform
whenever
a
crowd
could
be
collected
virginia
forgot
her
fear
of
him
when
he
stood
up
and
presented
arms
like
a
real
soldier
and
even
went
up
and
patted
him
when
the
show
was
over
joining
with
the
boys
in
begging
that
he
might
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
house
until
morning
maclntyre
was
determined
to
send
a
man
down
to
the
cabin
at
once
to
investigate
she
had
a
horror
of
tramps
but
the
boys
begged
her
to
wait
until
daylight
for
jonesy
sake
the
man
will
beat
him
if
he
finds
out
that
jonesy
warned
us
pleaded
keith
he
was
so
earnest
that
the
tears
stood
in
his
big
trustful
eyes
this
is
spoiling
the
party
mother
whispered
miss
allison
and
dinner
is
waiting
i
be
responsible
for
any
harm
that
may
be
done
if
you
will
let
the
boys
have
their
way
this
once
there
seemed
no
other
way
to
settle
it
just
then
so
bruin
was
allowed
to
go
back
to
his
rug
in
the
blue
room
and
the
door
was
securely
locked
keith
took
lloyd
down
to
dinner
and
his
grandmother
heard
him
apologising
all
the
way
down
for
having
frightened
her
the
little
queen
of
hearts
listened
smilingly
but
her
colour
did
not
come
back
all
evening
until
after
the
archery
contest
it
was
when
malcolm
came
up
with
the
prize
he
had
won
a
tiny
silver
arrow
and
pinned
it
in
the
knot
of
red
ribbon
on
her
shoulder
will
you
keep
it
to
remember
me
by
he
asked
bashfully
of
she
answered
with
a
smile
that
showed
all
her
roguish
dimples
i
keep
it
and
evah
to
remembah
how
neah
i
came
to
bein
eaten
up
by
yo
illustration
you
keep
it
to
remember
me
by
it
seems
too
bad
for
such
a
beautiful
party
to
come
to
an
end
sally
fairfax
said
when
the
last
merry
game
was
played
the
last
story
told
and
it
was
time
to
go
home
but
there
one
comfort
she
added
gathering
all
her
gay
valentines
together
there
need
be
any
end
to
the
remembering
of
it
i
had
a
good
time

was
so
late
when
the
last
carriage
rolled
down
the
avenue
bearing
away
the
last
smiling
little
guest
that
the
children
were
almost
too
sleepy
to
undress
it
was
not
long
until
the
last
light
was
put
out
in
every
room
and
a
deep
stillness
settled
over
the
entire
house
one
by
one
the
lights
went
out
in
every
home
in
the
valley
and
only
the
stars
were
left
shining
in
the
cold
wintry
sky
no
there
was
one
lamp
that
still
burned
it
was
in
the
little
cottage
where
old
professor
heinrich
sat
bowed
over
his
books
chapter
iv
a
fire
and
a
plan
some
people
said
that
old
johann
heinrich
never
slept
for
no
matter
what
hour
of
the
night
one
passed
his
lonely
little
house
a
lamp
was
always
burning
he
was
a
queer
old
german
naturalist
living
by
himself
in
a
cottage
adjoining
the
macintyre
place
he
had
been
a
professor
in
a
large
university
until
he
grew
too
old
to
keep
his
position
why
he
should
have
chosen
lloydsborough
valley
as
the
place
to
settle
for
the
remainder
of
his
life
no
one
could
tell
he
kept
kimself
away
from
his
neighbours
and
spent
so
much
time
roaming
around
the
woods
by
himself
that
people
called
him
queer
they
did
not
know
that
he
had
written
two
big
books
about
the
birds
and
insects
he
loved
so
well
or
that
he
could
tell
them
facts
more
wonderful
than
fairy
tales
about
these
little
wild
creatures
of
the
woodland
he
had
read
later
than
usual
and
his
fire
was
nearly
out
he
was
too
poor
to
keep
a
servant
so
when
he
found
that
the
was
empty
he
had
to
go
out
to
the
kitchen
to
fill
it
himself
that
is
why
he
saw
something
that
happened
soon
after
midnight
while
everybody
else
in
the
valley
was
sound
asleep
over
in
the
cabin
by
the
where
the
boys
had
left
the
tramp
and
jonesy
a
puff
of
smoke
went
curling
around
the
roof
then
a
tongue
of
flame
shot
up
through
the
cedars
and
another
and
another
until
the
sky
was
red
with
an
angry
glare
it
lighted
up
the
eastern
of
the
servants
cottage
but
the
inmates
tired
from
the
unusual
serving
of
the
evening
before
slept
on
it
shone
full
across
the
window
of
virginia
room
but
she
was
dreaming
of
being
chased
by
bears
and
only
turned
uneasily
in
her
sleep
the
old
professor
on
his
way
to
the
kitchen
noticed
that
it
seemed
strangely
light
outside
he
shuffled
to
the
door
and
looked
out
ach
himmel
he
exclaimed
excitedly
somebody
vill
shust
in
his
bed
be
burnt
if
old
johann
does
not
haste
make
not
waiting
to
close
the
door
behind
him
or
even
to
catch
up
something
to
protect
his
old
bald
head
from
the
intense
cold
of
the
winter
night
he
ran
out
across
the
garden
his
shuffling
feet
in
their
flapping
old
carpet
slippers
forgot
their
rheumatism
and
his
shoulders
dropped
the
weight
of
their
seventy
years
he
ran
like
a
boy
across
the
meadow
through
the
gap
in
the
fence
and
down
the
hill
to
the
cabin
by
the
spring
all
one
side
of
it
was
in
flames
the
fire
was
curling
around
the
front
door
and
bursting
through
the
windows
with
fierce
cracklings
dashing
frantically
around
to
the
back
door
he
threw
himself
against
it
shouting
to
know
if
any
one
was
within
a
blinding
rush
of
smoke
was
his
only
answer
as
he
backed
away
from
the
overpowering
heat
but
something
fell
across
the
in
a
limp
little
heap
it
was
jonesy
dragging
the
child
to
a
safe
distance
from
the
burning
building
he
ran
back
fearing
that
some
one
else
might
be
in
danger
but
this
time
the
flames
met
him
at
the
door
and
it
was
impossible
to
go
in
his
hoarse
shouting
roused
the
servants
but
by
the
time
they
reached
the
cabin
the
roof
had
fallen
in
and
all
danger
of
the
fire
spreading
to
other
buildings
was
over
while
the
professor
was
bending
over
jonesy
trying
to
bring
him
back
to
consciousness
miss
allison
came
running
down
the
path
she
had
an
eiderdown
quilt
wrapped
around
her
over
her
the
shouts
had
awakened
her
also
and
she
had
slipped
out
as
quietly
as
possible
not
wishing
to
alarm
her
mother
how
did
it
happen
she
demanded
breathlessly
is
the
child
badly
burned
is
any
one
else
hurt
is
the
tramp
in
the
cabin
no
one
gave
any
answer
to
her
rapid
questions
the
old
professor
shook
his
head
but
did
not
look
up
he
was
bending
over
jonesy
trying
to
restore
him
to
consciousness
he
seemed
to
know
the
right
things
to
do
for
him
and
in
a
little
while
the
child
opened
his
eyes
and
looked
around
wonderingly
in
a
few
minutes
he
was
able
to
tell
what
he
knew
about
the
fire
it
was
not
much
only
a
horrible
recollection
of
being
awakened
by
a
feeling
that
he
was
choking
in
the
thick
smoke
that
filled
the
room
of
hearing
the
boss
swear
at
him
to
be
quick
and
follow
him
or
he
would
be
burned
to
death
then
there
had
been
an
awful
moment
of
groping
through
the
blinding
choking
smoke
trying
to
find
a
way
out
the
man
sprang
to
a
window
and
made
his
escape
but
as
the
outside
air
rushed
in
through
the
opening
he
left
it
seemed
to
fan
the
smoke
instantly
into
flame
jonesy
had
struck
out
at
the
wall
of
fire
with
his
helpless
little
hands
and
then
by
the
scorching
pain
dropped
to
the
floor
and
crawled
in
the
opposite
direction
just
as
the
professor
burst
open
the
door
the
sight
of
the
poor
little
blistered
face
brought
the
tears
to
miss
allison
eyes
and
she
called
two
of
the
coloured
men
directing
them
to
carry
jonesy
to
the
house
and
then
go
at
once
for
a
doctor
but
the
professor
interfered
insisting
that
jonesy
should
be
taken
to
his
house
he
said
that
he
knew
how
to
prepare
the
cooling
bandages
that
were
needed
and
that
he
would
sit
up
all
night
to
apply
them
he
could
not
sleep
anyhow
he
said
after
such
great
excitement
but
i
feel
responsible
for
him
urged
miss
allison
since
it
happened
on
our
place
and
my
little
nephews
brought
him
here
it
seems
to
me
that
we
ought
to
have
the
care
of
him
the
professor
waved
her
aside
lifting
jonesy
head
as
tenderly
as
a
nurse
could
have
done
and
motioned
the
coloured
men
to
lift
him
up
no
no
fraulein
he
said
i
have
had
eggsperience
it
is
besser
the
poor
leedle
knabe
go
mit
me
there
was
no
opposing
the
old
man
masterful
way
miss
allison
stepped
aside
for
them
to
pass
calling
after
him
her
willingness
to
do
the
nursing
he
had
taken
upon
himself
and
insisting
that
she
would
come
early
in
the
morning
to
help
unc
henry
was
left
to
guard
the
ruins
lest
some
stray
spark
should
be
blown
toward
the
other
buildings
dis
yere
ole
niggah
mistaken
aftah
all
he
muttered
dee
was
somebody
prowlin
de
premises
yistiddy
evenin
then
he
searched
the
ground
all
around
the
cabin
for
footprints
in
the
snow
he
found
some
tracks
presently
and
followed
them
over
the
meadow
in
the
starlight
across
the
road
and
down
the
railroad
track
several
rods
there
they
suddenly
disappeared
the
tramp
had
evidently
walked
on
the
rail
some
distance
if
unc
henry
had
gone
quarter
of
a
mile
farther
up
the
track
he
would
have
found
those
same
sliding
imprints
on
every
other
crosstie
as
if
the
man
had
taken
long
running
leaps
in
his
haste
to
get
away
jonesy
stoutly
denied
that
the
man
had
set
fire
to
the
cabin
we
nearly
froze
to
death
that
night
he
said
when
questioned
about
it
afterward
and
the
boss
piled
on
an
awful
big
lot
of
wood
just
before
he
went
to
bed
then
what
made
him
take
to
his
heels
so
fast
if
he
did
some
one
asked
i
do
know
answered
jonesy
he
said
that
luck
was
always
against
him
and
maybe
he
thought
nobody
would
believe
him
if
he
did
say
that
he
did
do
it
several
days
after
that
malcolm
found
the
tramp
picture
in
the
he
was
a
noted
criminal
who
had
escaped
from
a
northern
penitentiary
some
two
months
before
and
had
been
arrested
by
the
louisville
police
there
was
no
mistaking
him
that
big
ugly
scar
branded
him
on
cheek
and
forehead
like
another
cain
and
to
think
that
that
terrible
man
was
harboured
on
my
place
exclaimed
macintyre
when
she
heard
of
it
and
you
boys
were
down
there
in
the
cabin
with
him
for
hours
sat
beside
him
and
talked
with
him
what
will
your
mother
say
i
feel
as
if
you
had
been
exposed
to
the
smallpox
and
i
can
not
be
too
thankful
now
that
the
boy
who
was
with
him
was
not
brought
here
he
is
a
fit
companion
for
you
not
that
the
poor
little
unfortunate
is
to
blame
he
can
not
help
being
a
child
of
the
slums
and
he
must
be
put
in
an
orphan
asylum
or
a
reform
school
at
once
it
is
probably
the
only
thing
that
can
save
him
from
growing
up
to
be
a
criminal
like
the
man
who
brought
him
here
i
shall
see
what
can
be
done
about
it
as
soon
as
possible
a
child
of
the
slums
malcolm
and
keith
repeated
the
expression
afterward
with
only
a
vague
idea
of
its
meaning
it
seemed
to
set
poor
jonesy
apart
from
themselves
as
something
unclean
something
that
their
happy
lives
must
not
be
allowed
to
touch
maybe
if
jonesy
had
been
an
attractive
child
with
a
sensitive
mouth
and
big
appealing
eyes
he
might
have
found
his
way
more
easily
into
people
hearts
but
he
was
a
lean
little
fellow
with
a
freckled
face
and
neglected
hair
no
one
would
ever
find
his
cheek
a
tempting
one
to
kiss
and
no
one
would
be
moved
by
any
feeling
save
pity
to
stoop
and
put
affectionate
arms
around
jonesy
he
was
only
a
common
little
street
gamin
as
unlovely
as
he
was
unloved
what
a
blessing
that
there
are
such
places
as
orphan
asylums
for
children
of
that
class
said
maclntyre
after
one
of
her
visits
to
him
i
must
make
arrangements
for
him
to
be
put
into
one
as
soon
as
he
is
able
to
be
moved
i
think
he
will
be
very
loath
to
leave
the
old
professor
answered
miss
allison
he
has
been
so
good
to
the
child
amusing
him
by
the
hour
with
his
microscopes
and
collections
of
insects
telling
him
those
delightful
old
german
tales
and
putting
him
to
sleep
every
night
to
the
music
of
his
violin
what
a
he
is
and
what
a
delightful
old
man
in
every
way
i
am
glad
we
have
discovered
him
yes
said
maclntyre
and
when
this
little
tramp
is
sent
away
i
want
the
children
to
go
there
often
i
asked
him
if
he
could
not
teach
them
this
spring
at
least
make
a
beginning
with
them
in
natural
history
and
he
appeared
much
pleased
he
is
as
poor
as
a
church
mouse
and
would
be
very
glad
of
the
money
that
reminds
me
said
miss
allison
he
asked
me
if
the
boys
could
not
come
down
to
see
jonesy
this
afternoon
and
bring
the
bear
he
thought
it
would
give
the
little
fellow
so
much
pleasure
and
might
help
him
to
forget
his
suffering
macintyre
hesitated
i
do
not
believe
their
mother
would
like
it
she
answered
sydney
is
careful
enough
about
their
associates
but
elise
is
doubly
particular
you
can
imagine
how
much
badness
this
child
must
know
when
you
remember
how
he
has
been
reared
he
told
me
that
his
name
is
jones
carter
and
that
he
can
not
remember
ever
having
a
father
or
a
mother
i
questioned
him
very
closely
this
morning
he
comes
from
the
worst
of
the
chicago
slums
he
slept
in
the
cellar
of
one
of
its
poorest
tenement
houses
and
lived
in
the
gutters
he
has
a
brother
only
a
little
older
who
is
a
bootblack
on
days
when
shines
were
plentiful
they
had
something
to
eat
otherwise
they
starved
or
begged
poor
little
lamb
murmured
miss
allison
it
was
by
the
brother
advice
he
came
away
with
that
tramp
continued
macintyre
he
had
gotten
possession
of
that
trained
bear
in
some
way
and
probably
took
a
fancy
to
jones
because
he
could
whistle
and
dance
all
sorts
of
jigs
he
probably
thought
it
would
be
a
good
thing
to
have
a
child
with
him
to
work
on
peoples
sympathies
they
walked
all
the
way
from
chicago
to
lloydsborough
jones
told
me
excepting
three
days
journey
they
made
in
a
wagon
they
have
been
two
months
on
the
road
and
showed
the
bear
in
the
country
places
they
passed
through
they
avoided
the
large
towns
think
what
a
christmas
he
must
have
had
exclaimed
miss
allison
christmas
i
doubt
if
he
ever
heard
the
word
his
speech
is
something
shocking
nothing
but
the
slang
of
the
streets
and
so
ungrammatical
that
i
could
scarcely
understand
him
at
times
no
i
am
very
sure
that
neither
sydney
nor
elise
would
want
the
boys
to
be
with
him
but
he
is
so
little
mother
and
so
sick
and
pitiful
looking
pleaded
miss
allison
surely
he
can
not
know
so
very
much
badness
or
hurt
the
boys
if
they
go
down
to
cheer
him
up
for
a
little
while
notwithstanding
maclntyre
fears
she
consented
to
the
boys
visiting
jonesy
that
afternoon
she
could
not
resist
the
second
appeal
or
the
boys
own
urging
they
took
the
bear
with
them
which
jonesy
welcomed
like
a
lost
friend
they
spent
an
interesting
hour
among
the
professor
collections
listening
to
his
explanations
in
his
funny
broken
english
then
they
explored
his
cottage
much
amused
by
his
queer
housekeeping
cracked
nuts
on
the
hearth
and
roasted
apples
on
a
string
in
front
of
the
fire
jonesy
did
not
seem
to
be
cheered
up
by
the
visit
as
much
as
the
professor
had
expected
presently
the
old
man
left
the
room
and
keith
sat
down
on
the
side
of
the
bed
what
makes
you
so
still
jonesy
he
asked
you
have
said
a
word
for
the
last
half
hour
i
was
thinking
about
barney
he
answered
keeping
his
face
turned
away
barney
is
my
brother
you
know
yes
so
grandmother
said
answered
keith
how
big
is
he
as
big
as
yourn
there
was
a
choke
in
jonesy
voice
now
seein
yourn
put
his
arm
across
your
shoulder
and
pullin
your
head
back
by
one
ear
and
pinchin
you
sort
in
fun
like
made
me
think
the
way
barney
uster
do
to
me
keith
did
not
know
what
to
say
so
there
was
a
long
awkward
pause
i
never
him
said
jonesy
but
the
boss
said
it
only
be
a
little
while
and
we
make
so
much
money
showin
the
bear
that
i
have
a
whole
pile
to
take
home
i
could
ride
back
on
the
cars
and
take
a
whole
trunk
full
of
nice
things
to
barney
clothes
and
candy
and
a
swell
watch
and
chain
and
a
bustin
beauty
of
a
bike
now
the
sold
and
the
boss
has
run
away
and
i
do
know
how
i
can
get
back
to
barney
him
an
me
all
each
other
got
and
i
want
to
see
him
bad
the
little
fellow
lip
quivered
and
he
put
up
one
bandaged
hand
to
wipe
away
the
hot
tears
that
would
keep
coming
in
spite
of
his
efforts
not
to
make
a
baby
of
himself
there
was
something
so
pitiful
in
the
gesture
that
keith
looked
across
at
malcolm
and
then
patted
the
bedclothes
with
an
affectionate
little
hand
never
mind
jonesy
he
said
papa
will
be
home
in
the
spring
and
he
send
you
back
to
barney
but
jonesy
never
having
known
anything
of
fathers
whose
chief
pleasure
is
in
spending
money
to
make
little
sons
happy
was
not
comforted
by
that
promise
as
much
as
keith
thought
he
ought
to
be
but
i
wo
be
here
then
he
sobbed
they
goin
to
put
me
in
a
and
i
ca
get
out
for
so
long
that
maybe
barney
will
be
dead
before
we
ever
find
each
other
again
he
was
crying
violently
now
who
is
going
to
put
you
in
an
asylum
asked
malcolm
lifting
an
end
of
the
pillow
under
which
jonesy
head
had
burrowed
to
hide
the
grief
that
his
manhood
made
him
too
proud
to
show
an
old
lady
with
white
hair
what
comes
here
every
day
the
professor
said
he
would
keep
me
if
he
was
so
old
and
hard
up
and
she
said
as
how
a
was
the
proper
place
for
a
child
of
the
slums
and
he
said
yes
if
they
was
nobody
to
care
for
but
i
got
somebody
he
cried
i
got
barney
oh
let
them
shut
me
up
somewhere
so
i
ca
never
get
back
to
barney
they
do
shut
you
up
when
they
send
you
to
an
asylum
said
malcolm
the
one
near
here
is
a
lovely
big
house
with
acres
of
green
grass
around
it
and
orchards
and
and
they
are
ever
so
good
to
the
children
and
give
them
plenty
to
eat
and
wear
and
send
them
to
school
barney
would
be
there
sobbed
jonesy
diving
under
the
pillow
again
i
do
want
nothing
but
him
well
we
see
what
we
can
do
said
malcolm
as
he
heard
the
professor
coming
back
if
we
could
only
keep
you
here
until
spring
i
am
sure
that
papa
would
send
you
back
all
right
he
always
helping
people
that
get
into
trouble
jonesy
took
his
little
snub
nose
out
of
the
pillow
as
the
professor
came
in
and
looked
around
defiantly
as
if
ready
to
fight
the
first
one
who
dared
to
hint
that
he
had
been
crying
the
boys
took
their
leave
soon
after
leading
the
bear
back
to
his
new
quarters
in
the
carriage
house
where
they
had
made
him
a
comfortable
den
then
they
walked
slowly
up
to
the
house
their
arms
thrown
across
each
other
shoulders
it
was
us
said
keith
after
walking
on
a
little
way
in
silence
that
you
and
i
were
left
of
all
the
family
and
have
any
friends
in
the
world
and
i
was
to
get
separated
from
you
and
could
get
back
that
would
be
tough
luck
for
sure
answered
malcolm
do
you
jonesy
feels
as
badly
about
it
as
we
would
asked
keith
should
be
surprised
said
malcolm
beginning
to
whistle
keith
joined
in
and
keeping
step
to
the
tune
like
two
soldiers
they
marched
on
into
the
house
virginia
found
them
in
the
library
a
little
while
later
sitting
on
the
they
were
still
talking
about
jonesy
they
could
think
of
nothing
else
but
the
loneliness
of
the
little
waif
and
his
pitiful
appeal
oh
do
let
them
shut
me
up
where
i
ca
never
get
back
to
barney
why
do
you
write
to
your
father
asked
virginia
when
they
had
told
her
the
story
of
their
visit
oh
it
is
so
hard
to
explain
things
in
a
letter
answered
malcolm
and
being
off
there
he
say
that
grandmother
and
all
the
grown
people
certainly
know
best
but
if
he
could
see
jonesy
how
pitiful
looking
he
is
and
hear
him
crying
to
go
back
to
his
brother
i
know
he
feel
the
way
we
do
about
it
i
called
the
professor
out
in
the
hall
and
told
him
so
said
keith
and
asked
him
if
he
could
adopt
jonesy
or
something
until
papa
comes
home
but
he
said
that
he
is
too
poor
he
has
only
a
few
dollars
a
month
to
live
on
i
did
mind
asking
him
he
smiled
in
that
big
kind
way
he
always
does
he
said
jonesy
was
lots
of
company
and
he
would
like
to
keep
him
this
summer
if
he
could
afford
it
and
let
him
get
well
and
strong
out
here
in
the
country
then
he
would
keep
him
till
uncle
sydney
comes
if
somebody
would
pay
his
board
asked
virginia
yes
said
malcolm
but
that
does
help
matters
much
for
we
children
are
the
only
ones
who
want
him
to
stay
and
our
monthly
allowances
all
put
together
would
be
enough
we
might
earn
the
money
ourselves
suggested
virginia
after
awhile
breaking
a
long
silence
how
demanded
malcolm
now
ginger
you
know
as
well
as
i
do
there
is
no
way
for
us
to
earn
anything
this
time
of
year
you
ca
pick
fruit
in
the
dead
of
winter
can
you
or
pull
weeds
or
rake
leaves
what
other
way
is
there
we
might
go
to
every
house
in
the
valley
and
exhibit
the
bear
said
keith
taking
up
a
collection
each
time
now
you
made
me
think
of
it
cried
virginia
excitedly
thought
of
a
good
way
we
give
jonesy
a
benefit
like
great
singers
have
the
bear
will
be
the
star
performer
and
we
all
act
too
and
sell
the
tickets
and
have
tableaux
i
love
to
arrange
tableaux
we
were
always
having
them
out
at
the
fort
i
bid
to
show
off
the
bear
cried
malcolm
entering
into
plan
at
once
may
be
i
learn
something
to
recite
too
i
help
print
the
tickets
said
keith
and
go
around
selling
them
and
be
in
anything
you
want
me
to
be
how
many
tableaux
are
you
going
to
have
ginger
i
ca
tell
yet
she
answered
but
a
moment
after
she
cried
out
her
eyes
shining
with
pleasure
oh
i
thought
of
a
lovely
one
we
can
have
the
little
colonel
and
the
bear
for
and
the
beast
malcolm
promptly
turned
a
somersault
on
the
rug
to
express
his
approval
but
came
up
with
a
grave
face
saying
i
bet
that
grandmother
will
say
we
ca
have
it
let
get
aunt
allison
on
our
side
suggested
virginia
she
up
in
her
room
now
painting
a
picture
a
little
sigh
of
disappointment
escaped
miss
allison
lips
as
she
heard
the
rush
of
feet
on
the
stairs
this
was
the
first
time
that
she
had
touched
her
brushes
since
the
children
coming
and
she
had
hoped
that
this
one
afternoon
would
be
free
from
interruption
when
she
heard
them
planning
their
afternoon
occupations
at
the
they
had
come
back
before
the
little
sketch
she
was
making
was
quite
finished
there
was
no
disappointment
however
in
the
bright
face
she
turned
toward
them
and
virginia
lost
no
time
in
beginning
her
story
she
had
been
elected
to
tell
it
but
before
it
was
done
all
three
had
had
a
part
in
the
telling
and
all
three
were
waiting
with
wistful
eyes
for
her
answer
well
what
is
it
you
want
me
to
do
she
asked
finally
oh
just
be
on
our
side
they
exclaimed
and
get
grandmother
to
say
yes
you
see
she
does
feel
about
jonesy
the
way
we
do
she
is
willing
to
pay
a
great
deal
of
money
to
have
him
taken
off
and
cared
for
but
she
says
she
does
see
how
grandchildren
of
hers
can
be
so
interested
in
a
little
tramp
that
comes
from
nobody
knows
where
and
who
will
probably
end
his
days
in
a
penitentiary
aunt
allison
answered
malcolm
last
remark
a
little
sternly
you
must
understand
that
it
is
only
for
your
own
good
that
she
is
opposed
to
jonesy
staying
she
said
there
is
nobody
in
the
valley
so
generous
and
kind
to
the
poor
as
your
grandmother
yes
said
virginia
meekly
but
you
ask
her
wo
you
please
auntie
miss
allison
smiled
at
her
persistence
wait
until
i
finish
this
she
said
then
i
go
and
put
the
matter
before
her
and
report
to
you
at
now
are
you
satisfied
yes
they
cried
in
chorus
you
on
our
side
it
all
right
now
with
a
series
of
hearty
hugs
that
left
her
almost
breathless
they
hurried
away
when
miss
allison
kept
her
promise
she
did
not
go
to
her
mother
with
the
children
story
of
jonesy
to
move
her
to
pity
she
told
her
simply
what
they
wanted
and
then
said
mother
you
know
i
have
begun
to
teach
the
children
the
of
sir
launfal
virginia
has
learned
every
word
of
it
and
the
boys
will
soon
know
all
but
the
preludes
there
will
never
be
a
better
chance
than
this
for
them
to
learn
the
lesson
what
we
give
but
what
we
share
for
the
gift
without
the
giver
is
bare
this
would
be
a
real
sharing
of
themselves
all
their
time
and
best
energies
for
they
will
have
to
work
hard
to
get
up
such
an
entertainment
as
this
it
is
for
jonesy
sake
i
ask
it
but
for
the
children
own
good
the
old
lady
looked
thoughtfully
into
the
fire
a
moment
and
then
said
maybe
you
are
right
allison
i
do
want
to
keep
them
unspotted
from
a
knowledge
of
the
world
evils
but
i
do
not
want
to
make
them
selfish
if
this
little
beggar
at
the
gate
can
teach
them
where
to
find
the
holy
grail
through
unselfish
service
to
him
i
do
not
want
to
stand
in
the
way
bless
their
little
hearts
they
may
play
sir
launfal
if
they
want
to
and
may
they
have
as
beautiful
a
vision
as
his
chapter
jonesy
benefit
the
jonesy
benefit
grew
like
jack
after
miss
allison
took
charge
of
it
there
was
less
than
a
week
in
which
to
get
ready
as
the
boys
insisted
on
having
it
on
the
of
february
in
honour
of
washington
birthday
but
in
that
short
time
the
childish
show
which
ginger
had
proposed
grew
into
an
entertainment
so
beautiful
and
elaborate
that
the
neighbourhood
talked
of
it
for
weeks
after
miss
allison
spent
one
sleepless
night
planning
her
campaign
like
a
general
and
next
morning
had
an
army
of
helpers
at
work
before
the
day
was
over
she
sent
a
letter
to
an
old
school
friend
of
hers
in
the
city
miss
eleanor
bond
who
had
been
her
most
intimate
companion
all
through
her
and
who
still
spent
a
part
of
every
summer
with
her
dearest
nell
the
letter
said
come
out
on
the
first
afternoon
train
if
you
love
me
the
children
are
getting
up
an
entertainment
for
charity
which
shall
be
duly
explained
on
your
arrival
no
time
now
i
am
superintending
a
force
of
carpenters
in
the
college
hall
where
the
entertainment
is
to
take
place

two
seamstresses
in
the
house
hurrying
up
costumes
and
am
helping
mother
scour
the
country
for
pretty
children
to
put
in
the
tableaux
the
house
is
like
an
in
commotion
there
is
so
much
scurrying
around
but
i
know
that
is
what
you
thoroughly
enjoy
you
shall
have
a
finger
in
every
pie
if
you
will
come
out
and
help
me
to
make
this
a
occasion
i
want
to
make
the
old
days
of
chivalry
live
again
for
virginia
and
malcolm
and
keith
i
am
going
back
to
king
arthur
court
for
the
flower
of
knighthood
at
his
round
table
come
and
read
for
us
between
tableaux
as
only
you
can
do
be
the
interpreter
of
launfal
vision
and
the
of
the
king
give
us
the
benefit
of
your
talent
for
sweet
charity
sake
if
not
for
the
sake
of
lang
syne
and
your
devoted
allison
she
be
here
said
miss
allison
as
she
sealed
the
letter
nodding
confidently
to
sherman
who
had
come
over
to
help
with
lloyd
costume
you
remember
nell
bond
do
you
not
she
took
the
prize
every
year
in
elocution
and
was
always
in
demand
at
every
entertainment
she
is
the
most
charming
reader
i
ever
heard
and
as
for
well
she
better
than
the
nights
you
must
let
the
little
colonel
come
over
every
evening
while
she
is
here
miss
bond
arrived
the
next
day
and
her
visit
was
a
time
of
continual
delight
to
the
children
they
followed
her
wherever
she
went
until
maclntyre
laughingly
called
her
the
piper
of
hamelin
and
asked
what
she
had
done
to
bewitch
them
the
first
night
they
gathered
around
the
all
as
busy
as
bees
keith
and
the
little
colonel
were
cutting
tinsel
into
various
lengths
for
virginia
to
tie
into
fringe
for
a
gay
banner
malcolm
was
gilding
some
old
spurs
maclntyre
sat
stringing
yards
of
wax
beads
that
gleamed
softly
in
the
lamplight
like
great
rope
of
pearls
and
sherman
was
painting
the
posters
which
were
to
be
put
up
in
the
and
depot
as
advertisements
of
the
jonesy
benefit
miss
allison
who
had
been
busy
for
hours
with
pasteboard
and
glue
and
scissors
held
up
the
suit
of
mail
which
she
had
just
finished
is
that
fine
cried
malcolm
it
looks
exactly
like
some
of
the
armour
we
saw
in
the
tower
of
london
does
it
keith
i
thought
of
a
riddle
exclaimed
virginia
why
is
aunt
head
like
aladdin
lamp
it
so
bright
ventured
malcolm
no
because
she
has
only
to
rub
it
and
everything
she
thinks
of
appears
i
do
see
how
it
is
possible
to
make
so
many
beautiful
things
out
of
almost
nothing
virginia
looked
admiringly
around
at
all
the
pretty
articles
scattered
over
the
room
a
helmet
with
nodding
white
plumes
lay
on
the
piano
a
queen
robe
trailed
its
royal
ermine
beside
it
a
sword
with
a
jewelled
hilt
shone
on
the
mantel
and
a
dozen
dazzling
shields
were
ranged
in
various
places
on
the
low
bookshelves
it
was
easy
in
the
midst
of
such
surroundings
for
the
children
to
imagine
themselves
back
in
the
days
of
king
arthur
and
his
court
while
miss
bond
sat
there
telling
them
such
beautiful
tales
of
its
fair
ladies
and
noble
knights
indeed
before
the
day
of
the
entertainment
came
around
they
even
found
themselves
talking
to
each
other
in
the
quaint
speech
of
that
olden
time
when
malcolm
accidentally
ran
against
his
grandmother
in
the
hall
instead
of
his
usual
oh
excuse
me
grandmother
it
was
prithee
grant
me
gracious
pardon
fair
dame
not
for
a
king
ransom
would
i
have
thus
jostled
thee
in
such
unseemly
haste
and
ginger
instead
of
giving
keith
a
slap
when
he
teasingly
penned
her
up
in
a
corner
to
make
her
divide
some
nuts
with
him
said
in
a
most
tragic
way
unhand
me
villain
or
by
my
troth
rue
this
ruffian
conduct
sore
the
was
strewn
with
books
of
old
court
life
and
pictures
of
kings
and
queens
whose
costumes
were
to
be
copied
in
the
tableaux
there
was
one
book
which
keith
carried
around
with
him
until
he
had
spelled
out
the
whole
beautiful
tale
it
was
called
in
kings
houses
and
was
the
story
of
the
little
duke
of
gloster
who
was
made
a
knight
in
his
boyhood
and
when
keith
had
read
it
himself
he
took
it
down
to
the
professor
and
read
it
all
over
again
to
jonesy
illustration
there
was
one
book
which
keith
carried
around
with
him
think
how
grand
he
must
have
looked
jonesy
cried
keith
and
i
am
to
be
dressed
exactly
like
him
when
i
am
knighted
in
the
tableau
then
he
read
the
description
again
suit
of
white
velvet
embroidered
with
seed
pearls
and
literally
blazing
with
jewels
even
the
buttons
being
great
brilliants
from
his
shoulder
hung
a
cloak
of
azure
blue
velvet
the
colour
of
the
order
richly
wrought
with
gold
and
around
his
neck
he
wore
the
magnificent
collar
and
jewel
of
george
and
the
dragon
that
was
the
personal
gift
of
his
majesty
the
king
think
how
splendid
it
must
have
been
jonesy
when
the
procession
came
in
to
the
music
of
trumpets
and
bugles
and
silver
flutes
and
hautboys
would
you
like
to
have
seen
the
heralds
marching
by
two
by
two
in
cloth
of
gold
with
an
escort
of
the
queen
guard
following
all
of
england
best
and
bravest
were
there
and
they
sat
in
the
carven
stalls
in
george
chapel
with
their
gorgeous
banners
drooping
over
them
i
saw
that
chapel
jonesy
when
we
were
in
england
and
i
saw
where
the
knights
kept
the
of
arms
in
the
holy
places
the
night
before
they
took
their
vows
he
picked
up
the
book
and
read
again
and
praying
and
lonely
watching
by
night
in
the
great
abbey
where
there
are
so
many
dead
folk
oh
do
you
wish
you
could
have
lived
in
those
days
jonesy
and
have
been
a
knight
it
was
all
greek
to
jonesy
the
terms
puzzled
him
but
he
enjoyed
keith
description
of
the
tournaments
several
evenings
after
that
keith
went
down
to
the
cottage
dressed
in
the
beautiful
velvet
costume
of
white
and
blue
ablaze
with
rhinestones
and
glittering
jewels
he
had
been
wrapped
in
his
aunt
allison
golf
cape
and
as
he
threw
it
off
jonesy
eyes
opened
wider
and
wider
with
wonder
hi
you
look
like
a
whole
jeweller
window
he
cried
dazzled
by
the
gorgeous
sight
the
professor
lighted
another
lamp
and
keith
turned
slowly
around
to
be
admired
on
every
side
like
a
pleased
peacock
of
course
it
all
only
imitation
he
explained
but
it
will
look
just
as
good
as
the
real
thing
behind
the
footlights
but
you
ought
to
see
the
stage
when
it
fixed
up
to
look
like
the
hall
of
the
shields
if
you
want
to
see
glitter
it
like
the
one
at
camelot
you
know
but
jonesy
did
not
know
and
keith
had
to
tell
about
that
old
castle
at
camelot
as
miss
bond
had
told
him
how
that
down
the
side
of
the
long
hall
ran
a
treble
range
of
shields
and
under
every
shield
a
knight
was
named
for
such
was
arthur
custom
in
his
hall
when
some
good
knight
had
done
one
noble
deed
his
arms
were
carven
only
but
if
twain
his
arms
were
blazoned
also
but
if
none
the
shield
was
blank
and
bare
without
a
sign
saving
the
name
beneath
keith
had
been
greatly
interested
in
watching
the
carpenters
fix
the
stage
so
that
it
could
be
made
to
look
like
the
hall
of
the
shields
in
a
very
few
moments
when
the
time
for
that
tableau
should
come
he
knew
where
every
glittering
shield
was
to
hang
and
every
banner
and
how
do
you
suppose
those
knights
felt
he
said
to
jonesy
who
saw
their
shields
hanging
there
year
after
year
blank
and
bare
because
they
had
never
done
even
one
noble
deed
they
must
have
been
dreadfully
ashamed
when
the
king
walked
by
and
read
their
names
underneath
and
then
looked
up
at
the
shields
and
saw
nothing
emblazoned
on
them
or
even
carved
seems
to
me
that
i
would
have
done
something
to
have
made
me
worthy
of
that
honour
if
i
had
for
it
something
it
may
have
been
the
soft
rich
colour
of
the
velvet
the
boy
wore
or
maybe
the
flush
that
rose
to
his
cheeks
at
the
thrill
of
such
noble
thoughts
something
had
brought
an
unusual
beauty
into
his
face
as
he
stood
there
with
head
held
high
his
dark
eyes
flashing
his
face
glowing
and
in
that
princely
dress
of
a
bygone
day
he
looked
every
inch
a
nobleman
there
was
something
so
pure
and
sweet
too
in
the
expression
of
his
upturned
face
that
the
light
upon
it
seemed
to
touch
it
into
an
almost
unearthly
fairness
the
professor
who
had
been
watching
him
with
a
tender
smile
on
his
rugged
old
face
drew
the
child
toward
him
and
brushed
the
hair
back
on
his
forehead
ach
liebchen
he
said
in
his
queer
broken
speech
thy
shield
will
never
be
blank
and
bare
already
thou
hast
blazoned
it
with
the
beauty
of
a
noble
purpose
and
like
galahad
thou
too
shalt
find
the
grail
it
was
keith
turn
to
be
puzzled
but
he
did
not
like
to
ask
for
an
explanation
there
was
something
so
solemn
in
the
way
the
old
man
put
his
hand
on
his
head
as
he
spoke
almost
as
if
he
were
bestowing
a
blessing
besides
it
was
time
to
go
to
the
rehearsal
at
the
college
one
of
the
servants
had
come
to
stay
with
jonesy
while
the
professor
went
over
to
practise
on
his
violin
he
was
to
play
behind
the
scenes
a
soft
low
accompaniment
to
miss
bond
reading
by
eight
the
night
of
the
benefit
every
seat
in
the
house
was
full
that
jolly
for
jonesy
exclaimed
malcolm
peeping
out
from
behind
the
curtain
we
counted
up
that
ten
cents
a
ticket
would
make
enough
if
they
were
all
sold
to
pay
his
board
till
papa
comes
home
and
buy
him
all
the
new
clothes
he
needs
too
now
every
ticket
is
sold
hurry
up
malcolm
called
keith
we
are
first
on
the
programme
and
it
is
time
to
begin
there
was
a
great
bustle
behind
the
scenes
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
beauty
and
the
beast
was
announced
when
the
little
colonel
came
on
the
stage
leading
the
great
bear
such
a
cheering
and
clapping
began
that
they
both
looked
around
half
frightened
but
the
boys
followed
immediately
and
the
little
colonel
dressed
as
a
flower
girl
danced
out
to
meet
keith
who
came
in
clicking
his
castanets
in
time
to
whistling
the
bear
was
made
to
go
through
all
his
tricks
and
his
soldier
drill
the
children
in
the
audience
stood
on
tiptoe
in
their
eagerness
to
see
the
great
animal
perform
and
were
so
wild
in
their
applause
that
the
boys
begged
to
be
allowed
to
take
it
in
front
of
the
curtain
every
time
during
the
evening
when
there
was
a
long
pause
while
some
tableau
was
being
prepared
over
the
rustle
of
fluttering
programmes
and
the
hum
of
conversation
that
followed
the
first
number
there
fell
presently
the
soft
sweet
notes
of
the
professor
violin
and
miss
bond
musical
voice
began
the
story
of
the
vision
of
sir
launfal
my
golden
spurs
now
bring
to
me
and
bring
to
me
my
richest
mail
for
i
go
over
land
and
sea
in
search
of
the
holy
grail
here
the
curtains
were
drawn
apart
to
show
malcolm
seated
on
his
pony
as
sir
launfal
in
his
gilded
mail
that
flamed
so
bright
it
was
really
a
beautiful
picture
he
made
and
his
grandmother
leaning
forward
her
face
beaming
with
pride
at
the
boy
noble
bearing
compared
him
with
arthur
himself
with
lance
in
rest
from
spur
to
plume
a
star
of
tournament
the
next
tableau
showed
him
spurning
the
leper
at
his
gate
and
turning
away
in
disgust
from
the
beggar
who
seemed
the
one
blot
on
the
summer
morn
how
miss
bond
voice
rang
out
when
the
leper
raised
not
the
gold
from
the
dust
better
to
me
the
poor
man
crust
that
is
no
true
alms
which
the
hand
can
hold
he
gives
nothing
but
worthless
gold
who
gives
from
a
sense
of
duty
in
the
next
tableau
it
was
as
an
old
bent
man
and
frail
that
sir
launfal
came
back
from
his
weary
pilgrimage
he
had
not
found
the
holy
grail
but
through
his
own
sufferings
he
had
learned
pity
for
all
pain
and
poverty
once
more
he
stood
beside
the
leper
at
his
castle
gate
but
this
time
he
stooped
to
share
with
him
his
crust
and
wooden
bowl
of
water
then
it
happened
on
the
stage
just
as
was
told
in
the
poem
a
light
shone
round
about
the
place
and
the
crouching
leper
stood
up
the
old
ragged
mantle
dropped
off
and
there
in
a
long
garment
almost
dazzling
in
its
whiteness
stood
a
figure
shining
and
tall
and
fair
and
straight
as
the
pillar
that
stood
by
the
beautiful
gate
they
could
not
see
the
face
it
was
turned
aside
but
the
golden
hair
was
like
a
glory
and
the
uplifted
arms
held
something
high
in
air
that
gleamed
like
a
burnished
star
as
all
the
lights
in
the
room
were
turned
full
upon
it
for
a
little
space
it
was
a
golden
cup
then
the
voice
again
in
many
climes
without
avail
thou
hast
spent
thy
life
for
the
holy
grail
behold
it
is
here
this
cup
which
thou
didst
fill
at
the
streamlet
for
me
but
now
the
holy
supper
is
kept
indeed
in
whatso
we
share
with
another
need
it
was
an
old
story
to
most
of
the
audience
worn
threadbare
by
many
readings
but
with
these
living
illustrations
and
miss
wonderful
way
of
telling
it
a
new
meaning
crept
into
the
lines
that
thrilled
every
listener
could
you
understand
that
teddy
asked
old
judge
fairfax
patting
his
little
grandson
on
the
head
course
exclaimed
ted
who
had
followed
his
sister
sally
to
every
rehearsal
when
you
give
money
to
people
just
to
get
rid
of
and
because
you
feel
you
ought
to
it
does
count
for
anything
but
if
you
divide
something
you
got
and
would
like
to
keep
it
all
yourself
because
you
love
to
and
are
sorry
for
then
it
counts
a
pile
sir
launfal
would
have
popped
jonesy
into
a
when
he
first
started
out
to
find
that
gold
cup
but
when
he
came
back
he
worked
like
a
horse
getting
up
a
benefit
for
him
and
would
have
divided
his
own
home
with
him
if
he
had
been
living
at
his
grandmother
and
could
an
amused
smile
went
around
that
part
of
the
audience
which
overheard
ted
shrilly
given
explanation
pictures
from
the
idylls
of
the
king
followed
in
rapid
succession
and
then
came
the
prettiest
of
all
being
the
one
in
which
keith
was
made
a
knight
virginia
as
queen
her
short
black
hair
covered
by
a
powdered
wig
and
a
long
sweeping
behind
her
stood
touching
his
shoulder
with
the
sword
as
he
knelt
at
her
feet
lloyd
and
sally
fairfax
julia
ferris
and
a
dozen
other
pretty
girls
of
the
neighbourhood
helped
to
fill
out
the
gay
court
scene
while
all
the
boys
that
could
be
persuaded
to
take
part
were
dressed
up
for
heralds
guardsmen
pages
and
knights
that
tableau
had
to
be
shown
four
times
and
then
the
audience
kept
on
applauding
as
if
they
never
intended
to
stop
the
last
one
in
this
series
of
tableaux
was
the
hall
of
the
shields
as
keith
had
described
it
to
jonesy
a
whole
row
of
dazzling
shields
hung
across
the
back
of
the
stage
emblazoned
with
the
arms
of
all
the
old
knights
whose
names
have
come
down
to
us
in
song
or
story
then
for
the
first
time
that
evening
miss
bond
came
out
on
the
stage
where
she
could
be
seen
and
told
the
story
of
the
death
of
king
arthur
and
the
passing
away
of
the
order
of
the
round
table
she
told
it
so
well
that
little
ted
fairfax
listened
with
his
mouth
open
seeming
to
see
the
great
arm
that
rose
out
of
the
water
to
take
back
the
king
sword
into
the
sea
from
which
it
had
been
given
him
an
arm
like
a
giant
clothed
in
white
samite
mystic
wonderful
that
caught
the
sword
by
the
hilt
flourished
it
three
times
and
drew
it
under
the
mere
true
old
order
changeth
said
miss
bond
but
knighthood
has
passed
away
the
flower
of
chivalry
has
blossomed
anew
in
this
new
world
and
america
too
has
her
hall
of
the
shields
just
a
moment
the
curtains
were
drawn
together
and
then
were
widely
parted
again
as
a
chorus
of
voices
rang
out
with
the
words
hail
columbia
happy
land
hail
ye
heroes
band
in
that
moment
on
every
shield
had
been
hung
the
pictured
face
of
some
man
who
had
helped
to
make
his
country
a
power
among
the
nations
presidents
patriots
philanthropists
statesmen
inventors
and
poets
there
they
were
from
army
and
navy
city
and
farm
college
halls
and
humble
cabins
a
long
long
line
and
the
first
was
washington
and
the
last
was
the
hero
of
manila
cheer
after
cheer
went
up
and
it
might
have
been
well
to
have
ended
the
programme
there
but
to
satisfy
the
little
ginger
one
more
was
added
there
ought
to
be
a
goddess
of
liberty
in
it
she
insisted
because
it
is
washington
birthday
and
if
we
had
been
doing
it
by
ourselves
we
were
going
to
have
something
in
it
about
cuba
on
papa
account
so
when
the
curtain
rose
the
last
time
it
was
on
sally
fairfax
as
a
gorgeous
goddess
of
liberty
conferring
knighthood
on
two
boys
who
stood
for
the
army
and
navy
while
a
little
girl
knelt
at
their
feet
as
cuba
the
distressed
maiden
whom
their
chivalry
had
rescued
it
was
late
when
the
performance
closed
later
still
when
the
children
reached
home
that
night
for
macintyre
had
determined
to
have
a
picture
taken
of
them
and
they
had
to
wait
until
the
photographer
could
send
home
for
his
camera
after
they
reached
the
house
they
could
hardly
be
persuaded
to
undress
virginia
trailed
up
and
down
the
halls
in
her
royal
robes
malcolm
clanked
around
in
his
suit
of
mail
and
plumed
helmet
and
keith
stood
before
a
mirror
admiring
the
handsome
little
figure
it
showed
him
i
hate
to
take
it
off
he
said
fingering
the
dazzling
collar
ablaze
with
jewels
i
like
to
be
a
knight
always
and
wear
a
sword
and
spurs
every
day
so
would
i
said
malcolm
beginning
to
yawn
sleepily
i
wish
that
jonesy
had
been
well
enough
to
go
is
it
splendid
that
the
benefit
turned
out
so
well
aunt
allison
says
there
is
plenty
of
money
now
to
get
jonesy
clothes
and
pay
his
board
till
papa
comes
and
send
him
back
to
barney
too
if
papa
thinks
best
and
has
any
better
plan
i
wish
there
been
enough
money
to
buy
a
nice
little
home
out
here
in
the
country
for
him
and
barney
would
it
have
been
lovely
if
there
had
cried
keith
well
i
should
say
answered
malcolm
maybe
we
can
have
another
benefit
some
day
and
make
enough
for
that
with
this
pleasant
prospect
before
them
they
laid
aside
their
knightly
garments
hoping
to
put
them
on
again
soon
in
jonesy
behalf
and
talked
about
the
home
that
might
be
his
some
day
until
they
fell
asleep
the
pictures
of
the
three
children
were
all
that
the
fondest
grandmother
could
wish
as
soon
as
they
came
keith
carried
his
away
to
his
room
to
admire
in
private
it
is
so
pretty
that
it
does
seem
it
can
be
me
he
said
propping
it
up
on
the
desk
before
him
i
wish
that
i
could
look
that
way
always
the
next
time
that
miss
allison
went
into
the
room
she
found
that
keith
had
written
under
it
in
his
round
boyish
hand
a
quotation
that
had
taken
his
fancy
the
first
time
he
heard
it
it
was
in
one
of
miss
stories
and
he
repeated
it
until
he
learned
it
pure
truth
right
the
wrong
follow
the
king
else
wherefore
born
she
asked
him
about
it
at
bedtime
why
that
our
motto
he
explained
malcolm
has
it
written
under
his
too
we
made
up
our
minds
to
be
a
sort
of
knight
just
as
near
the
real
thing
as
we
can
you
know
and
that
is
what
knights
have
to
do
live
pure
and
speak
truth
and
right
the
wrong
we
always
tried
to
do
the
first
two
so
that
wo
be
so
hard
it
righting
the
wrong
that
will
be
the
tough
job
but
we
have
done
it
a
little
teenty
weenty
bit
for
jonesy
do
you
think
auntie
it
was
all
wrong
that
he
should
have
such
a
hard
time
and
be
sent
to
an
asylum
away
from
barney
when
we
have
you
all
and
everything
nice
malcolm
and
i
have
been
talking
it
over
if
we
could
do
something
to
keep
him
from
growing
up
into
a
tramp
like
that
awful
man
that
brought
him
here
would
that
be
as
good
a
deed
as
some
that
the
real
knights
did
would
that
be
serving
our
country
too
aunt
allison
just
a
little
speck
he
asked
the
question
anxiously
malcolm
said
nothing
but
also
waited
with
a
wistful
look
for
her
answer
my
dear
little
sir
galahads
she
said
bending
over
to
give
each
of
the
boys
a
kiss
you
will
be
truly
knights
if
you
can
live
up
to
the
motto
you
have
chosen
heaven
help
you
to
be
always
as
worthy
of
that
title
as
you
are
keith
held
her
a
moment
with
both
arms
around
her
neck
what
does
that
mean
auntie
he
asked
that
is
what
the
professor
said
too
galahad
it
is
too
late
to
explain
to
you
she
said
but
i
will
tell
you
sometime
soon
dear
it
was
several
days
before
she
reminded
them
of
that
promise
then
she
called
them
into
her
room
and
told
them
the
story
of
sir
galahad
the
maiden
knight
whose
strength
was
as
the
strength
of
ten
because
his
heart
was
pure
then
from
a
little
morocco
case
lined
with
purple
velvet
she
took
two
pins
that
she
had
bought
in
the
city
that
morning
each
was
a
little
white
enamel
flower
with
a
tiny
diamond
in
the
centre
like
a
drop
of
dew
you
ca
wear
armour
in
these
days
she
said
as
she
fastened
one
on
the
lapel
of
each
boy
coat
but
this
shall
be
the
badge
of
your
knighthood
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
the
little
pins
will
help
you
to
remember
maybe
and
will
remind
you
that
you
are
pledged
to
right
the
wrong
wherever
you
find
it
in
little
things
as
well
as
great
it
was
a
very
earnest
talk
that
followed
the
boys
came
out
from
her
room
afterward
wearing
the
tiny
white
pins
and
with
a
sweet
seriousness
in
their
faces
a
noble
purpose
had
been
born
in
their
hearts
but
alas
for
chivalry
the
first
thing
they
did
was
to
taunt
virginia
with
the
fact
that
she
could
never
be
a
knight
because
she
was
only
a
girl
i
do
care
retorted
ginger
quickly
i
can
be
a
a
anyhow
and
that
lots
better
the
boys
laughed
and
she
flushed
angrily
they
ought
to
mean
the
same
thing
exactly
in
this
day
of
the
world
said
miss
allison
coming
up
in
time
to
hear
the
dispute
that
followed
virginia
you
shall
have
a
badge
too
run
into
my
room
and
bring
me
that
little
jewelled
flag
on
my
cushion
i
think
that
this
is
the
very
prettiest
piece
of
jewelry
you
have
exclaimed
virginia
coming
back
with
the
pin
it
was
a
little
flag
whose
red
white
and
blue
was
made
of
tiny
settings
of
garnets
sapphires
and
diamonds
you
think
that
because
it
is
in
the
shape
of
a
flag
said
miss
allison
with
an
amused
smile
well
it
shall
be
yours
see
how
well
it
can
remind
you
of
the
boys
knightly
motto
there
is
the
white
for
the
first
part
the
pure
and
the
blue
for
the
truth
and
then
the
red
surely
no
soldier
little
daughter
needs
to
be
told
what
that
stands
for
when
her
own
brave
father
has
spilled
part
of
his
good
red
to
the
wrong
on
the
field
of
battle
oh
aunt
allison
was
all
that
virginia
could
gasp
in
her
delight
as
she
clasped
the
precious
pin
tightly
in
her
hand
is
it
mine
for
my
very
own
for
your
very
own
dear
was
the
answer
oh
i
so
glad
cried
virginia
thanking
her
with
a
kiss
i
a
thousand
times
rather
have
it
than
one
like
the
boys
it
means
so
much
more
chapter
vi
the
little
colonel
two
rescues
early
in
march
when
the
crocuses
were
beginning
to
bud
under
the
windows
there
came
one
of
those
rare
spring
days
that
seem
to
carry
the
warmth
of
summer
in
its
sunshine
exactly
the
kind
of
a
day
for
a
picnic
virginia
had
said
that
morning
and
when
her
grandmother
objected
saying
that
the
ground
was
still
too
damp
she
suggested
having
it
in
the
the
boys
piled
the
hay
that
was
left
from
the
winter
supply
up
on
one
side
of
the
great
airy
room
set
wide
the
big
double
doors
and
swept
it
clean
it
is
clean
enough
now
for
even
grandmother
to
eat
in
said
virginia
as
she
spread
a
cloth
on
the
table
unc
henry
had
carried
out
for
them
it
good
enough
for
a
queen
oh
i
tell
you
what
let
do
play
that
malcolm
and
i
are
a
wicked
king
and
queen
and
lloyd
is
a
ladye
that
we
have
shut
up
in
a
dungeon
this
will
be
a
banquet
and
while
we
are
eating
keith
can
be
the
knight
who
comes
to
her
rescue
and
carries
her
off
on
his
pony
that
all
right
consented
keith
except
the
eating
part
how
can
we
get
our
share
of
the
picnic
we
save
it
for
you
answered
virginia
and
you
can
eat
it
afterward
save
enough
for
jonesy
too
said
keith
he
shall
be
my
page
and
help
me
rescue
her
i
go
and
ask
him
now
the
month
had
made
a
great
change
in
jonesy
with
plenty
to
eat
his
thin
little
face
grew
plump
and
bright
there
was
a
twinkle
in
his
sharp
eyes
and
being
quick
as
a
monkey
at
imitating
the
movements
of
those
around
him
macintyre
found
nothing
to
criticise
in
his
manners
when
malcolm
and
keith
brought
him
into
the
house
their
pride
in
him
was
something
amusing
and
seeing
that
after
all
he
was
an
inoffensive
little
fellow
she
made
no
more
objections
to
their
playing
with
him
by
the
time
keith
was
back
again
with
jonesy
the
other
guests
had
arrived
and
the
little
colonel
had
been
lowered
into
a
deep
in
lieu
of
a
dungeon
the
banquet
began
in
great
state
but
in
a
few
moments
was
interrupted
by
a
fearful
shrieking
from
the
depths
of
the
bin
the
fair
ladye
protested
that
she
would
not
stay
in
her
dungeon
there
nasty
big
spidahs
down
heah
she
called
ow
one
is
on
my
neck
now
and
my
face
is
all
tangled
up
in
cobwebs
get
me
out
get
me
out
quick
gingah
the
king
sprang
up
to
go
to
her
rescue
but
was
promptly
motioned
to
his
seat
again
by
a
warning
shake
of
the
other
crowned
head
why
of
course
there
always
spiders
in
dungeons
called
the
wicked
queen
coolly
helping
herself
to
another
piece
of
chicken
besides
you
should
say
majesty
when
you
are
talking
to
me
but
there
a
mouse
in
heah
too
she
called
back
in
distress
oo
oo
it
ran
ovah
my
feet
if
you
do
make
them
take
me
out
of
heah
gingah
dudley
i
do
something
to
you
murdah
murdah
she
yelled
pounding
on
the
sides
of
the
bin
with
both
her
fists
and
stamping
her
little
foot
in
a
furious
rage
illustration
the
little
colonel
had
been
lowered
into
a
deep
seeing
that
lloyd
was
really
terrified
and
fearing
that
her
screams
would
bring
some
one
from
the
house
the
royal
couple
and
their
guests
sprang
to
the
rescue
nearly
upsetting
the
banquet
as
they
did
so
the
game
would
have
been
broken
up
then
when
she
was
lifted
out
from
the
red
and
angry
if
it
had
not
been
for
the
king
great
tact
he
brushed
the
cobwebs
from
her
face
and
hair
and
even
got
down
on
his
royal
knees
to
ask
her
pardon
his
polite
coaxing
finally
had
its
effect
on
the
little
lady
and
he
persuaded
her
to
climb
a
ladder
into
a
loft
just
above
them
here
on
a
pile
of
clean
hay
beside
an
open
window
that
looked
across
a
peaceful
meadow
her
anger
cooled
towers
were
far
more
comfortable
than
dungeons
in
her
opinion
and
when
malcolm
came
up
the
ladder
with
a
plateful
of
the
choicest
morsels
of
the
feast
she
began
to
enjoy
her
part
of
the
play
jonesy
was
sent
to
inform
his
knight
of
the
change
from
dungeon
to
tower
and
the
banquet
went
merrily
on
he
found
keith
waiting
below
the
barn
with
his
pony
tied
to
a
fence
on
the
other
side
of
the
fence
lay
the
railroad
track
which
skirted
the
back
of
macintyre
place
for
over
half
a
mile
do
you
see
that
asked
keith
pointing
with
his
to
one
on
the
track
the
section
boss
let
malcolm
and
me
ride
up
and
down
on
it
all
afternoon
one
day
this
winter
some
workman
left
it
on
the
switch
while
ago
and
while
you
were
up
at
the
barn
i
got
two
darkeys
to
move
it
for
me
they
did
want
to
at
first
but
i
knew
that
there
be
no
train
along
for
an
hour
and
told
so
and
they
finally
did
it
for
a
dime
apiece
as
soon
as
i
rescue
lloyd
i
dash
down
here
on
my
pony
with
her
behind
me
then
we
slip
through
the
fence
and
get
on
the
and
be
out
of
sight
around
the
curve
before
the
rest
get
here
they
wo
know
where
on
earth
we
gone
and
it
will
be
the
best
joke
on
them
it
down
grade
all
the
way
to
the
so
i
can
push
it
easily
enough
by
myself
but
i
need
your
help
coming
back
maybe
you
cut
across
lots
to
the
as
soon
as
i
start
to
the
barn
and
meet
me
there
it
is
half
as
far
that
way
so
you
get
there
as
soon
as
we
do
all
right
said
jonesy
i
your
kid
you
should
say
well
sir
knight
i
fly
to
do
thy
bidding
prompted
keith
jonesy
grinned
he
could
not
enter
into
the
spirit
of
the
play
as
the
others
did
aw
i
be
on
time
he
said
then
as
keith
untied
his
pony
started
on
a
run
across
the
fields
the
lady
lloyd
had
not
finished
her
repast
when
her
rescuer
appeared
but
she
put
the
plate
down
on
the
hay
to
await
her
return
and
obediently
climbed
down
the
ladder
he
placed
for
her
they
reached
the
fence
before
the
banqueters
knew
that
she
had
escaped
flinging
the
pony
bridle
over
a
when
they
reached
the
edge
of
the
field
the
brave
knight
crawled
through
the
fence
and
pulled
lloyd
after
him
tearing
her
dress
much
to
that
dainty
little
extreme
disgust
by
the
time
the
king
and
his
guard
were
mounted
in
pursuit
on
the
other
pony
which
stood
in
waiting
the
runaways
were
in
the
it
moved
slowly
at
first
although
keith
was
strong
for
his
age
and
his
hardy
little
muscles
were
untiring
is
it
lovely
cried
lloyd
as
they
moved
faster
and
faster
and
swept
around
the
curve
i
wish
we
could
go
all
the
way
to
louisville
on
this
the
warm
march
wind
fanned
her
pink
cheeks
and
blew
her
soft
light
hair
into
her
eyes
jonesy
was
waiting
at
the
and
waved
his
cap
as
they
passed
we
going
on
around
the
next
bend
shouted
keith
as
they
passed
him
this
is
fine
and
not
a
bit
hard
to
work
what
will
the
wicked
queen
think
when
she
ca
find
us
asked
lloyd
laughing
happily
as
they
sped
on
down
the
track
she
think
that
i
am
a
magician
and
have
spirited
you
away
said
keith
then
if
you
are
a
magician
you
ought
to
change
her
into
a
nasty
black
spidah
to
pay
her
back
fo
shuttin
me
up
with
them
lloyd
was
delighted
with
this
new
play
for
the
time
it
seemed
as
if
she
really
were
escaping
from
a
castle
prison
faster
and
faster
they
went
jonesy
who
had
followed
them
to
the
second
curve
stood
watching
them
with
wistful
eyes
wishing
he
could
be
with
them
they
passed
the
depot
and
then
the
seemed
to
grow
smaller
and
smaller
as
it
rolled
away
until
it
was
only
a
moving
speck
in
the
distance
then
he
turned
and
walked
back
to
the
i
we
gone
about
far
enough
said
keith
after
awhile
better
turn
around
now
and
go
back
or
the
picnic
will
all
be
over
before
we
get
our
share
let
wait
here
a
minute
till
i
rest
my
arms
and
then
we
start
the
place
where
they
had
stopped
was
the
loneliest
part
of
the
track
that
could
be
found
in
miles
on
either
side
it
was
in
the
midst
of
a
thick
beech
woods
and
the
twitter
of
a
bird
now
and
then
was
the
only
sound
in
all
the
deep
stillness
what
lovely
green
moss
on
that
bank
cried
the
little
colonel
would
it
make
a
beautiful
carpet
for
our
playhouse
down
by
the
old
mill
i
get
you
some
said
keith
gallantly
springing
from
the
car
and
clambering
up
the
bank
taking
out
his
knife
he
began
to
cut
great
squares
of
the
velvety
green
moss
and
pile
it
up
to
carry
back
to
the
meanwhile
jonesy
waited
at
the
digging
his
heels
into
the
cinders
that
lined
the
track
and
looking
impatiently
down
the
road
presently
the
section
boss
came
limping
along
painfully
and
sat
down
on
the
bank
in
the
warm
spring
sunshine
he
had
dropped
a
piece
of
heavy
machinery
on
his
foot
the
week
before
and
was
only
able
to
hobble
short
distances
everybody
in
the
valley
was
interested
in
jonesy
since
the
fire
and
the
benefit
had
made
him
so
well
known
and
the
man
was
glad
of
this
opportunity
to
satisfy
his
curiosity
about
the
boy
jonesy
with
all
the
fearlessness
of
a
little
street
gamin
brought
up
in
a
big
city
answered
him
fearlessly
even
saucily
at
times
much
to
the
man
amusement
so
you
want
to
get
a
job
around
here
do
you
said
the
man
presently
with
a
grin
maybe
i
can
give
you
one
know
anything
about
railroadin
heaps
answered
jonesy
well
i
ought
to
seem
as
i
lived
next
door
to
the
engine
yards
all
my
life
and
spent
my
time
dodgin
the
cop
on
watch
there
when
i
was
tryin
to
steal
rides
on
and
such
is
that
what
you
hangin
around
here
now
for
asked
the
man
with
a
twinkle
in
his
eyes
nope
i
waiting
for
that
macintyre
kid
to
come
back
this
way
he
went
down
the
track
a
bit
ago
on
a
playing
rescue
a
princess
with
one
of
the
girls
at
the
picnic
the
section
boss
sprang
up
with
an
exclamation
of
alarm
how
far
he
gone
he
asked
there
a
special
due
to
pass
here
in
a
few
minutes
even
while
he
spoke
there
sounded
far
away
in
the
distance
so
far
that
it
was
like
only
a
faint
echo
the
whistle
of
an
approaching
locomotive
the
man
hobbled
down
the
track
a
yard
or
so
and
stopped
what
do
you
suppose
they
do
he
asked
there
are
so
many
bends
in
this
road
the
train
may
come
right
on
to
before
the
engineer
sees
they
jump
off
or
turn
and
try
to
come
back
jonesy
glanced
around
wildly
a
second
and
then
sprang
forward
toward
the
man
give
me
the
he
cried
in
a
high
voice
shrill
with
excitement
you
ca
run
but
i
can
give
me
the
perplexed
by
the
sudden
turn
of
affairs
and
the
little
commanding
tone
the
man
took
the
key
from
his
pocket
he
realised
his
own
helplessness
to
do
anything
and
there
was
something
in
manner
that
inspired
confidence
he
felt
that
the
child
quick
wit
had
grasped
the
situation
and
formed
some
sensible
plan
of
action
again
the
whistle
sounded
in
the
distance
and
snatching
the
key
jonesy
was
off
down
the
track
like
an
arrow
the
section
boss
leaning
heavily
on
his
cane
limped
after
him
as
fast
as
he
could
keith
and
the
little
colonel
having
gathered
the
moss
and
started
back
home
were
rolling
leisurely
along
still
talking
of
magicians
and
their
ilk
what
if
we
should
meet
a
dragon
cried
the
little
colonel
a
dragon
with
a
scaly
green
tail
and
red
eyes
and
a
fiery
tongue
what
would
you
do
then
i
say
ho
thou
monster
and
cleave
him
in
twain
with
my
good
broadsword
and
when
he
saw
its
shining
blade
smite
through
the
air
just
curl
up
and
die
keith
looked
back
to
smile
at
the
bright
laughing
face
beside
him
then
he
caught
sight
of
something
over
his
shoulder
that
made
him
pause
oh
look
he
cried
pointing
over
the
behind
them
a
little
puff
of
smoke
rising
up
in
the
distance
trailed
along
the
sky
like
a
long
banner
at
the
same
instant
out
of
the
smoke
sounded
the
whistle
of
an
approaching
engine
the
track
behind
them
had
so
many
turns
he
could
not
judge
of
their
distance
from
it
and
for
an
instant
he
stopped
working
the
handle
bar
up
and
down
too
thoroughly
frightened
to
know
what
to
do
an
older
child
might
have
acted
differently
might
have
jumped
from
the
and
left
it
to
be
run
into
by
the
approaching
train
or
have
hurried
back
around
the
bend
to
flag
the
engine
but
keith
had
only
one
idea
left
that
was
to
keep
ahead
of
the
train
as
long
as
possible
it
seemed
so
far
away
he
thought
they
could
surely
reach
the
depot
before
it
caught
up
with
them
and
his
sturdy
little
arms
bent
to
the
task
for
a
moment
there
was
a
real
pleasure
in
the
exertion
he
felt
with
an
excited
thrill
that
he
was
really
running
away
with
the
little
colonel
and
rescuing
her
from
a
pursuing
danger
suddenly
the
whistle
sounded
again
and
this
time
it
seemed
so
close
behind
them
that
the
little
colonel
gave
a
terrified
glance
over
her
shoulder
and
then
screamed
at
the
sight
of
the
great
snorting
monster
breathing
out
fire
and
smoke
worse
than
any
dragon
that
she
had
ever
imagined
it
was
far
down
the
track
but
they
could
hear
its
terrible
rumble
as
it
rushed
over
a
trestle
and
the
singing
of
the
wires
overhead
keith
was
straining
every
muscle
now
but
it
was
like
running
in
a
nightmare
his
arms
moved
up
and
down
at
a
furious
speed
but
it
seemed
to
him
that
the
was
glued
to
one
spot
it
seemed
too
that
it
had
been
hours
since
they
first
discovered
that
the
engine
was
after
them
and
he
felt
that
he
would
soon
be
too
exhausted
to
move
another
stroke
would
the
depot
never
never
come
in
sight
just
then
they
shot
around
the
curve
and
caught
sight
of
jonesy
at
the
depot
switch
wildly
beckoning
with
his
cap
and
shouting
for
them
to
come
on
at
that
sight
with
one
supreme
effort
keith
put
his
strength
to
the
test
and
sent
the
rolling
forward
faster
than
ever
it
shot
past
the
switch
that
jonesy
had
unlocked
and
off
to
the
just
as
the
train
bore
down
upon
them
around
the
last
bend
there
was
barely
time
for
jonesy
to
set
the
switch
again
before
it
thundered
on
along
the
main
track
past
the
little
depot
being
a
special
it
did
not
stop
as
it
went
shrieking
by
the
engineer
cast
a
curious
glance
at
a
on
the
a
little
girl
sat
on
it
a
pretty
child
with
dark
eyes
big
with
fright
and
her
face
as
white
as
her
dress
he
wondered
what
was
the
matter
for
a
moment
after
the
shrieking
train
whizzed
by
everything
seemed
deathly
still
keith
sat
leaning
against
the
embankment
white
and
limp
from
exhaustion
and
the
excitement
of
his
close
escape
jonesy
was
panting
and
wiping
the
perspiration
from
his
red
face
for
he
had
run
like
a
deer
to
reach
the
switch
in
time
i
could
have
held
out
a
minute
longer
said
keith
presently
my
arms
felt
like
they
had
gone
to
sleep
and
i
was
just
ready
to
give
up
when
i
caught
sight
of
you
that
seemed
to
give
me
strength
to
go
on
when
i
saw
what
you
were
at
and
that
it
would
only
be
a
little
farther
to
go
before
we
would
be
safe
plow
did
you
happen
to
be
at
the
switch
and
know
how
to
set
it
hai
lived
all
my
life
around
engine
yards
fer
nothin
answered
jonesy
why
did
you
jump
off
and
flag
the
train
i
was
so
taken
by
surprise
i
did
think
of
that
answered
keith
the
only
thing
i
knew
was
that
we
had
to
keep
ahead
of
it
as
long
as
possible
you
saved
my
life
jones
carter
and
i
never
forget
it
no
matter
what
comes
i
been
rescued
twice
said
the
little
colonel
taking
a
deep
breath
as
she
began
to
recover
from
her
fright
jonesy
ought
to
be
a
knight
too
that
so
exclaimed
keith
springing
to
his
feet
come
on
and
go
back
to
the
barn
we
tell
our
adventures
and
then
we
go
through
the
ceremony
of
making
jonesy
a
sir
something
or
other
certainly
won
his
spurs
goin
back
on
the
asked
jonesy
not
much
answered
keith
with
a
sickly
sort
of
smile
somehow
such
fast
travelling
does
seem
to
agree
with
a
fellow
walking
is
good
enough
for
me
me
too
cried
the
little
colonel
tying
on
her
white
sunbonnet
but
the
first
part
of
it
was
lovely
just
like
flyin
jonesy
ran
back
to
give
the
man
his
key
and
was
kept
answering
questions
so
long
that
he
did
not
catch
up
with
the
other
children
until
they
were
in
sight
of
the
barn
after
all
said
keith
as
the
three
trudged
along
together
maybe
we
better
not
tell
how
near
we
came
to
being
run
over
grandmother
and
aunt
allison
would
be
dreadfully
worried
if
they
should
hear
of
it
they
are
always
worrying
for
fear
something
will
happen
to
us
mothah
would
be
exclaimed
the
little
colonel
if
she
knew
i
had
been
in
any
dangah
maybe
she
would
let
me
out
of
her
sight
again
to
play
all
summah
then
let
do
tell
for
a
long
long
time
proposed
keith
it
be
our
secret
just
for
us
three
all
right
the
others
agreed
they
dropped
the
subject
then
for
the
barn
was
just
ahead
of
them
and
the
gay
picnickers
came
running
out
demanding
to
know
where
they
had
been
so
long
the
little
colonel
often
spoke
of
her
experience
afterward
to
the
two
boys
however
and
in
keith
a
home
for
jonesy
began
to
crowd
out
all
other
hopes
and
plans
chapter
vii
a
game
of
indian
keith
was
stiff
for
a
week
after
his
race
on
the
but
did
his
groaning
in
private
he
knew
what
a
commotion
would
be
raised
if
the
matter
came
to
his
grandmother
ears
she
had
lived
all
winter
in
constant
dread
of
accidents
malcolm
had
been
carried
home
twice
in
an
unconscious
state
once
from
having
been
thrown
from
his
bicycle
and
once
from
falling
through
a
in
the
barn
keith
had
broken
through
the
ice
on
the
pond
sprained
his
wrist
while
coasting
and
walked
in
half
a
dozen
times
with
the
blood
streaming
from
some
wound
on
his
head
or
face
virginia
had
never
been
hurt
but
her
escapes
would
have
filled
a
volume
an
amusing
one
was
the
time
she
lassoed
a
young
calf
indian
fashion
to
show
the
boys
how
it
should
be
done
its
angry
mother
was
in
the
next
lot
but
virginia
felt
perfectly
safe
as
she
swung
her
lariat
and
dragged
the
bleating
calf
around
the
she
did
not
stop
to
consider
that
if
a
cow
with
lofty
ambitions
had
once
jumped
over
the
moon
one
which
saw
its
calf
in
danger
might
easily
leap
a
low
hedge
malcolm
warning
shout
came
just
in
time
to
save
her
from
being
gored
by
the
angry
animal
who
charged
at
her
with
lowered
horns
she
sprang
up
the
ladder
leading
to
the
window
where
she
was
safe
but
she
had
to
hang
there
until
unc
henry
could
be
called
to
the
rescue
it
was
with
many
misgivings
that
macintyre
and
miss
allison
started
to
the
city
one
morning
in
april
it
was
the
first
time
since
the
children
coming
that
they
had
both
gone
away
at
once
and
nothing
but
urgent
business
would
have
made
them
consent
to
go
the
children
promised
at
least
a
dozen
things
they
would
keep
away
from
the
barn
the
live
stock
the
railroad
the
ponds
and
the
cisterns
they
would
not
ride
their
wheels
climb
trees
nor
go
off
the
maclntyre
premises
and
they
would
keep
a
sharp
lookout
for
snakes
and
poison
ivy
in
case
they
went
into
the
woods
for
wild
flowers
illustration
virginia
and
the
calf
seems
to
me
there
mighty
little
left
that
a
fellow
can
do
said
keith
when
the
long
list
was
completed
oh
the
time
will
soon
pass
said
his
grandmother
who
was
preparing
to
take
the
eleven
train
it
will
soon
be
then
this
is
the
day
for
you
each
to
write
your
weekly
letters
to
your
mother
and
it
is
so
pretty
in
the
woods
now
that
i
am
sure
you
will
enjoy
looking
for
violets
time
did
pass
quickly
as
their
grandmother
had
said
it
would
until
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
then
virginia
began
to
wish
for
something
more
amusing
than
the
quiet
guessing
games
they
had
been
playing
in
the
library
the
boys
each
picked
up
a
book
and
she
strolled
off
in
search
of
a
livelier
occupation
in
a
few
minutes
she
came
down
looking
like
a
second
pocahontas
in
her
indian
suit
with
her
bow
and
arrows
slung
over
her
shoulder
i
am
going
down
to
the
woods
to
practise
shooting
she
announced
as
she
stopped
to
look
in
at
the
door
oh
wait
just
a
minute
begged
malcolm
throwing
down
his
book
let
all
play
indian
this
afternoon
we
rig
up
too
and
build
a
wigwam
down
by
the
spring
rock
and
make
a
fire
grandmother
did
say
we
could
make
a
fire
that
about
the
only
thing
she
forgot
to
tell
us
not
to
do
you
can
come
on
when
you
get
ready
answered
virginia
i
going
now
because
it
is
getting
late
but
you
find
me
near
the
spring
when
you
come
just
yell
the
boys
could
not
hope
to
rival
virginia
indian
costume
but
no
little
savages
ever
uttered
a
than
the
two
which
presently
dashed
into
the
still
april
woods
malcolm
had
ripped
some
variegated
fringe
from
a
to
pin
down
the
sides
of
his
leather
leggins
he
had
borrowed
a
roman
blanket
from
aunt
allison
couch
to
pin
around
his
shoulders
and
emptied
several
tubes
of
her
most
expensive
paints
to
streak
his
face
with
hideous
stripes
and
daubs
a
row
of
feathers
from
the
was
fastened
around
his
forehead
by
a
broad
band
and
a
hatchet
from
the
woodshed
provided
him
with
a
tomahawk
keith
had
no
time
to
arrange
feathers
he
had
taken
off
his
flannels
in
order
to
put
on
an
old
striped
which
he
had
found
in
the
attic
and
stored
away
intending
to
use
it
for
swimming
in
the
pond
when
the
weather
should
grow
warm
enough
it
had
no
sleeves
and
the
short
trousers
had
shrunk
until
they
did
not
reach
his
knees
its
red
and
white
stripes
had
faded
and
the
colour
run
until
the
whole
was
a
dingy
crushed
strawberry
shade
as
malcolm
had
emptied
all
the
tubes
of
red
paint
in
his
aunt
allison
box
keith
had
to
content
himself
with
some
other
colour
he
chose
the
different
shades
of
green
squeezing
the
paint
out
on
his
plump
little
legs
and
arms
and
rubbing
it
around
with
his
fore
finger
until
he
was
encircled
with
as
many
stripes
as
a
zebra
although
the
day
was
warm
for
the
early
part
of
april
the
sudden
change
from
his
customary
clothes
and
spring
flannels
to
nothing
but
the
airy
bathing
suit
and
made
him
a
trifle
chilly
so
he
completed
his
costume
by
putting
on
a
pair
of
scarlet
bedroom
slippers
edged
with
dark
fur
with
the
dropping
of
their
civilised
clothing
the
boys
seemed
to
have
dropped
all
recollections
of
their
professed
knighthood
and
acted
like
the
little
savages
they
looked
we
going
to
shoot
with
your
things
awhile
ginger
shouted
keith
coming
suddenly
upon
her
with
a
whoop
and
snatching
her
bow
out
of
her
hands
you
are
the
squaw
so
you
have
to
do
all
the
work
get
down
there
now
behind
that
rock
and
make
a
fire
while
we
go
out
and
kill
a
deer
you
must
build
a
wigwam
too
by
the
time
we
get
back
hear
me
i
a
big
chief
am
famine
buckadawin
and
i
make
a
living
skeleton
of
you
if
you
do
hustle
virginia
was
furious
i
not
be
a
squaw
she
cried
and
i
not
build
a
fire
or
do
anything
else
if
you
talk
so
rudely
if
you
give
me
back
my
bow
and
let
me
be
a
chief
too
i
i
get
even
with
you
sir
in
a
way
you
wo
like
i
have
short
hair
and
my
clothes
are
more
indian
than
yours
and
i
can
shoot
better
than
either
of
you
anyhow
so
there
give
me
my
bow
what
will
you
do
if
i
wo
said
keith
teasingly
holding
it
behind
him
i
go
up
to
the
barn
and
get
a
rope
and
lasso
you
like
i
did
that
calf
and
drag
you
all
over
the
place
cried
virginia
her
eyes
shining
with
fierce
determination
she
means
it
keith
said
malcolm
she
do
it
sure
if
you
stop
teasing
oh
give
it
to
her
and
come
along
or
it
will
be
dark
before
we
begin
to
play
matters
went
on
more
smoothly
after
malcolm
efforts
at
peacemaking
and
when
it
was
decided
that
ginger
could
be
a
brave
too
instead
of
a
squaw
they
were
soon
playing
together
as
pleasantly
as
if
they
had
found
the
happy
hunting
grounds
the
short
afternoon
waned
fast
and
the
shadows
were
growing
deep
when
they
reached
the
last
part
of
the
game
ginger
had
been
taken
prisoner
and
they
were
tying
her
to
a
tree
with
her
hands
bound
securely
behind
her
back
she
rather
enjoyed
this
part
of
it
for
she
intended
to
show
them
how
brave
she
could
be
now
we
sit
around
the
council
fire
and
decide
how
to
torture
her
said
malcolm
when
the
captive
was
securely
tied
but
the
fire
was
out
and
they
had
no
matches
the
lot
fell
on
malcolm
to
run
up
to
the
house
and
get
some
a
fire
would
feel
good
said
keith
looking
around
with
a
shiver
as
he
seated
himself
on
a
log
near
ginger
the
sun
was
low
in
the
west
and
very
little
of
its
light
and
warmth
found
its
way
into
the
woods
where
the
children
were
playing
it
makes
me
think
of
hiawatha
said
ginger
looking
down
at
several
long
streaks
of
golden
light
which
lay
across
the
ground
at
her
feet
do
you
remember
how
it
goes
the
long
and
level
sunbeams
shot
their
spears
into
the
forest
breaking
through
its
shield
of
shadow
is
that
pretty
i
love
hiawatha
i
am
going
to
learn
pages
and
pages
of
it
some
day
i
know
all
that
part
about
minnehaha
now
say
it
while
we
are
waiting
said
keith
pulling
his
short
trousers
down
as
far
as
possible
and
wishing
that
he
had
sleeves
or
else
that
the
paint
were
thicker
on
his
chilly
arms
all
right
began
virginia
the
long
and
dreary
winter
oh
the
cold
and
cruel
winter
ever
thicker
thicker
thicker
froze
the
ice
on
lake
and
river
ugh
do
interrupted
keith
with
a
shiver
it
makes
my
teeth
chatter
talking
about
such
cold
things
just
then
a
shout
came
ringing
down
the
hill
oh
keith
come
here
a
minute
quick
what
do
you
yelled
keith
in
return
come
up
here
quick
hurry
up
what
do
you
can
be
the
matter
exclaimed
keith
scrambling
to
his
feet
maybe
the
bear
has
got
loose
and
run
away
come
and
untie
me
first
said
virginia
and
i
go
too
keith
gave
several
quick
tugs
at
the
many
knotted
string
which
bound
her
but
could
not
loosen
it
again
the
call
came
impatient
and
sharp
keith
keith
oh
i
ca
loosen
it
a
bit
said
keith
you
have
to
wait
till
malcolm
comes
with
his
knife

back

just
a
minute

go
and

what
the
matter

sure
that
you

screamed
ginger
as
the
scarlet
bedroom
slippers
and
green
striped
legs
flashed
out
of
sight
through
the
bushes
back
in
a
minute
sounded
shrilly
through
the
woods
keith
found
malcolm
on
the
back
porch
pounding
excitedly
on
a
box
which
the
had
left
there
a
few
minutes
before
it
the
camera
we
have
been
looking
for
all
week
he
cried
come
on
and
have
a
look
at
it
ginger
said
to
hurry
back
said
keith
pshaw
it
wo
take
but
a
minute
i
pry
the
box
open
in
a
jiffy
it
was
harder
work
than
the
boys
had
supposed
to
take
the
tightly
nailed
lid
from
its
place
and
they
were
so
intent
on
their
work
they
did
not
realise
how
quickly
the
minutes
were
passing
is
it
a
beauty
exclaimed
malcolm
when
it
was
at
last
unpacked
it
lots
bigger
and
finer
than
the
one
papa
promised
but
that
the
way
he
always
does
oh
is
it
a
peach
i
tell
you
what
said
keith
dancing
up
and
down
in
his
excitement
until
he
looked
like
a
ridiculous
little
clown
in
the
faded
pink
and
his
stripes
of
green
paint
let
take
each
pictures
while
we
are
dressed
this
way
we
may
never
look
so
funny
again
and
we
can
go
down
and
take
ginger
too
while
she
is
tied
to
the
tree
ca
now
said
malcolm
it
too
dark
down
there
in
the
woods
by
this
time
see
there
is
nothing
left
now
of
the
sun
but
those
red
clouds
above
the
place
where
it
went
down
i
afraid
it
is
too
dark
even
for
us
up
here
on
the
hill
but
we
can
try
you
do
look
funny
just
like
a
or
a
monkey
on
a
stick
surely
ginger
wo
mind
waiting
long
enough
for
us
to
do
it
said
keith
anyhow
we
can
never
dress
up
this
way
again
and
grandmother
will
be
coming
home
very
soon
so
you
take
mine
quick
and
i
will
take
yours
the
boys
had
had
some
practice
before
with
a
cheap
little
camera
but
this
required
some
studying
of
the
printed
directions
before
they
could
use
it
the
first
time
they
tried
it
the
plates
were
put
in
wrong
and
the
second
time
they
forgot
to
remove
the
cap
there
were
other
things
in
the
box
besides
the
camera
some
beautiful
pink
curlew
wings
a
handsomely
marked
snake
skin
and
some
rare
shells
that
had
been
picked
up
on
the
gulf
coast
of
course
the
boys
had
to
examine
each
new
treasure
as
it
was
discovered
one
thing
after
another
delayed
them
until
it
was
dusk
even
on
the
porch
where
they
stood
and
in
the
woods
below
a
deep
twilight
had
fallen
every
minute
that
had
sped
by
so
rapidly
for
the
boys
seemed
an
age
to
the
captive
virginia
her
arms
ached
from
the
strain
of
their
unusual
position
swarms
of
gnats
flew
about
stinging
her
face
and
mosquitoes
buzzed
teasingly
around
her
ears
she
was
unable
to
move
a
finger
to
drive
them
away
when
the
boys
had
been
gone
fifteen
minutes
she
thought
they
must
have
been
away
hours
at
the
end
of
half
an
hour
she
was
wild
with
impatience
to
get
loose
but
thinking
they
might
return
any
minute
she
made
no
sign
of
her
discomfort
she
would
be
as
heroic
as
the
bravest
brave
ever
tortured
by
cruel
savages
as
long
as
it
was
light
she
kept
up
her
courage
but
presently
it
began
to
grow
dark
under
the
great
a
frog
down
by
the
spring
set
up
a
dismal
croaking
what
if
they
should
not
come
back
and
her
grandmother
and
aunt
allison
should
miss
the
train
and
have
to
stay
in
the
city
all
night
then
nobody
would
come
to
set
her
free
and
she
would
have
to
stay
in
the
lonely
woods
all
by
herself
tied
to
a
tree
with
her
hands
behind
her
back
at
that
thought
she
began
calling
keith
keith
malcolm
oh
malcolm
but
only
an
echo
came
back
to
her
as
it
had
to
the
dying
minnehaha
a
echo
that
mocked
her
with
its
teasing
cry
of
call
after
call
went
ringing
through
the
woods
but
nobody
answered
nobody
came
there
was
a
rustling
through
the
leaves
behind
her
as
of
a
snake
gliding
around
the
tree
she
was
not
afraid
of
snakes
in
the
daytime
and
when
she
was
unbound
but
she
shrieked
and
turned
cold
at
the
thought
of
one
wriggling
across
her
feet
while
she
was
powerless
to
get
away
every
time
a
twig
snapped
or
there
was
a
fluttering
in
the
bushes
she
strained
her
eyes
to
see
what
horrible
thing
might
be
creeping
up
toward
her
she
had
no
thought
that
live
indians
might
be
lurking
about
but
all
the
terrible
stories
she
had
ever
heard
of
the
days
of
daniel
boone
and
the
early
settlers
came
back
to
haunt
the
woods
with
a
nameless
dread
she
felt
that
she
was
standing
on
the
real
kentucky
that
the
indians
meant
when
they
gave
the
state
its
name
and
bloody
ground
dark
and
bloody
something
seemed
to
say
just
behind
her
then
the
trees
took
it
up
and
all
the
leaves
whispered
sh
sh
dark
and
bloody
ground
sh
at
that
she
was
so
frightened
that
she
began
calling
again
but
the
sound
of
her
own
voice
startled
her
oh
they
are
not
coming
she
thought
with
a
miserable
ache
in
her
throat
that
seemed
swelling
bigger
and
bigger
i
have
to
stay
here
in
the
woods
all
night
oh
mamma
mamma
she
moaned
i
am
so
scared
if
you
could
only
come
back
and
get
your
poor
little
girl
up
to
this
time
she
had
bravely
fought
back
the
tears
but
just
then
a
flapped
down
from
a
branch
above
her
with
such
a
dismal
hooting
that
she
gave
a
nervous
start
and
a
cry
of
terror
oh
that
frightened
me
so
she
sobbed
i
do
believe
i
can
stand
it
to
be
out
here
all
night
alone
with
so
many
horrible
creepy
things
everywhere
and
nobody
cares
nobody
but
papa
and
mamma
and
they
are
away
way
off
in
cuba
maybe
i
never
see
them
any
more
at
that
the
tears
rolled
down
her
face
and
she
could
not
move
a
hand
to
wipe
them
away
to
be
so
little
and
miserable
and
forsaken
so
worn
out
with
waiting
and
so
helpless
among
all
these
unknown
horrors
that
the
dark
woods
might
hold
was
worse
torture
to
the
imaginative
child
than
any
bodily
pain
could
have
been
it
was
just
as
her
last
bit
of
courage
oozed
away
and
she
began
to
cry
that
the
boys
suddenly
realised
how
long
they
had
left
her
it
must
be
as
dark
as
a
pocket
in
the
woods
by
this
time
exclaimed
malcolm
what
do
you
suppose
ginger
will
say
to
us
for
leaving
her
so
long
you
will
have
to
take
a
knife
to
cut
her
loose
said
keith
i
tried
to
untie
the
knots
before
i
came
away
but
i
could
move
them
my
is
answered
malcolm
i
get
something
in
the
that
will
do
he
was
rushing
out
again
with
a
in
his
hand
when
he
came
face
to
face
with
his
grandmother
and
aunt
allison
the
boys
had
been
so
interested
in
their
camera
that
they
had
not
heard
the
train
whistle
or
the
sound
of
footsteps
coming
up
on
the
front
veranda
pete
was
lighting
the
hall
lamps
as
the
ladies
came
in
and
he
turned
his
back
to
hide
the
broad
grin
on
his
face
as
he
thought
of
the
sight
which
would
soon
greet
them
maclntyre
gave
a
gasp
of
astonishment
and
sank
down
in
the
nearest
chair
as
malcolm
came
dashing
into
the
bright
lamplight
his
turkey
feathers
were
all
awry
standing
out
in
a
dozen
different
directions
from
his
head
his
blanket
trailed
behind
him
and
the
fringe
was
hanging
in
festoons
from
his
leggins
where
it
had
come
unpinned
the
red
paint
on
his
face
made
him
look
as
if
he
had
been
in
a
fight
with
the
he
carried
and
had
had
the
skin
peeled
off
his
face
in
patches
wild
as
he
looked
his
appearance
was
tame
beside
that
of
the
little
savage
who
skipped
in
after
him
in
the
scarlet
bedroom
slippers
pink
striped
and
green
striped
skin
keith
maclntyre
what
have
you
been
doing
to
yourself
gasped
his
grandmother
both
boys
began
an
excited
exclamation
but
were
stopped
by
miss
allison
question
where
is
virginia
have
you
two
little
savages
scalped
her
she
tied
to
a
tree
down
by
the
spring
answered
malcolm
we
are
just
starting
down
there
now
to
cut
her
loose
you
see
we
were
playing
indian
and
she
was
tied
up
to
be
tortured
and
we
forgot
all
about
her
being
there
but
miss
allison
waited
to
hear
no
more
the
poor
little
thing
she
exclaimed
tied
out
there
alone
in
the
dark
woods
how
could
you
be
so
cruel
it
is
enough
to
frighten
her
into
spasms
i
awfully
sorry
aunt
allison
began
malcolm
but
his
aunt
was
already
out
of
hearing
out
of
the
door
she
ran
through
the
dewy
grass
and
the
stubble
of
the
field
beyond
regardless
of
her
dainty
spring
gown
or
her
new
patent
leather
shoes
malcolm
and
keith
dashed
out
after
her
ran
on
ahead
and
were
at
the
spring
before
she
had
climbed
the
fence
into
the
woodland
virginia
was
not
crying
when
the
boys
reached
her
she
remembered
that
she
had
once
called
malcolm
because
she
caught
him
crying
over
something
that
seemed
to
her
a
very
little
reason
and
she
did
not
intend
to
give
him
a
chance
to
taunt
her
in
the
same
way
she
was
glad
that
it
was
too
dark
for
him
to
notice
her
eyes
whew
it
dark
down
here
said
keith
were
you
frightened
ginger
he
asked
as
he
helped
malcolm
unfasten
the
cords
that
bound
her
but
ginger
made
no
reply
to
either
questions
or
apologies
she
walked
on
in
dignified
silence
too
deeply
hurt
by
their
neglect
too
full
of
a
sense
of
the
wrong
they
had
done
her
to
trust
herself
to
speak
without
crying
and
she
intended
to
be
game
to
the
last
but
when
she
came
upon
miss
allison
and
suddenly
found
herself
folded
safe
in
her
arms
with
pitying
kisses
and
comforting
caresses
she
clung
to
her
sobbing
as
if
her
heart
would
break
oh
auntie
it
was
so
awful
was
all
she
could
say
but
she
repeated
it
again
and
again
until
miss
allison
who
had
never
seen
her
so
excited
before
was
alarmed
the
boys
who
had
run
on
ahead
to
the
house
again
before
she
gave
way
to
her
feelings
were
inclined
to
look
upon
it
all
as
a
good
joke
for
they
had
no
idea
how
much
she
had
suffered
and
did
not
like
it
because
she
would
not
speak
to
them
they
changed
their
minds
when
miss
allison
came
out
of
virginia
room
a
little
later
and
told
them
that
the
fright
had
given
the
child
a
nervous
chill
and
that
she
had
cried
herself
to
sleep
we
did
mean
to
do
it
said
keith
penitently
we
just
forgot
and
i
mighty
sorry
truly
i
am
auntie
i
am
not
scolding
you
said
miss
allison
but
if
i
were
either
of
you
boys
i
would
wear
my
little
white
flower
when
i
dressed
for
dinner
instead
of
being
the
protector
of
a
distressed
maiden
as
the
old
knights
would
have
said
you
have
done
her
a
wrong
a
serious
one
i
am
afraid
and
that
wrong
ought
to
be
made
right
as
far
as
possible
before
you
are
worthy
to
wear
the
badge
of
knighthood
again
we
go
and
beg
her
pardon
right
now
said
malcolm
no
she
is
asleep
now
and
i
do
not
want
her
to
be
disturbed
besides
a
mere
apology
is
not
enough
you
must
make
some
kind
of
atonement
the
first
thing
for
you
to
do
however
is
to
get
some
turpentine
and
remove
that
paint
where
did
you
get
it
boys
out
of
your
aunt
allison
said
malcolm
we
did
think
you
would
care
i
was
only
going
to
take
a
little
but
it
soaked
in
so
fast
that
i
had
to
use
two
tubes
of
it
i
used
more
than
that
confessed
keith
looking
at
her
with
his
big
honest
eyes
but
i
got
so
interested
pretending
that
i
was
turning
into
a
real
indian
that
i
never
thought
about
its
being
anybody
paint
aunt
allison
truly
i
did
she
turned
away
to
hide
a
smile
the
earnest
little
face
above
the
striped
body
was
so
very
comical
picking
up
several
of
the
empty
tubes
that
had
been
squeezed
quite
flat
she
read
the
labels
rose
madder
and
carmine
she
said
solemnly
two
of
my
very
most
expensive
paints
dear
me
sighed
malcolm
then
there
another
wrong
that
got
to
be
righted
i
guess
keith
and
i
were
cut
out
for
knights
i
beginning
to
think
that
it
a
mighty
tough
business
anyhow
that
night
when
the
boys
came
down
to
dinner
no
little
white
flower
with
its
diamond
dewdrop
centre
shone
on
the
lapel
of
either
coat
it
had
been
a
work
of
time
to
scrub
off
the
paint
and
then
it
took
almost
as
long
to
get
rid
of
the
turpentine
so
that
dinner
was
ready
long
before
keith
was
finally
clad
in
his
flannels
my
throat
is
sore
he
complained
to
malcolm
at
bedtime
but
did
not
mention
it
to
any
one
else
that
night
he
sat
on
the
side
of
his
bed
a
moment
before
undressing
with
one
foot
across
his
knee
staring
thoughtfully
at
the
lamp
presently
with
one
shoe
in
his
hand
and
the
other
half
unlaced
he
hopped
over
to
the
and
stood
before
it
looking
at
first
one
picture
and
then
another
eight
different
photographs
of
his
mother
were
ranged
along
the
table
below
the
wide
mirror
some
taken
in
evening
dress
some
in
simple
street
costume
and
each
one
so
beautiful
that
it
would
have
been
hard
to
decide
which
one
had
the
greatest
charm
i
wish
mamma
was
here
said
keith
softly
with
a
little
quiver
of
his
lip
seems
like
she
been
gone
almost
always
he
picked
up
a
large
roman
locket
of
beaten
silver
that
lay
open
on
the
table
it
held
two
exquisitely
painted
miniatures
on
ivory
one
was
the
same
sweet
face
that
looked
out
at
him
from
each
of
the
photographs
the
other
was
his
father
it
showed
a
handsome
young
fellow
with
strong
face
with
eyes
like
keith
and
the
same
lordly
poise
of
the
fine
head
that
malcolm
had
good
night
papa
good
night
mamma
whispered
keith
touching
his
lips
hastily
to
each
picture
while
malcolm
back
was
turned
there
were
tears
in
his
eyes
somehow
he
was
so
miserably
homesick
next
morning
although
keith
throat
was
not
so
sore
he
was
burning
with
fever
by
the
time
his
lessons
were
over
before
his
grandmother
saw
him
he
was
off
on
his
wheel
for
a
long
ride
and
then
because
he
was
so
hot
when
he
came
back
he
slipped
away
to
the
pond
with
the
pink
under
his
coat
and
took
the
swim
that
he
had
been
looking
forward
to
so
long
nobody
knew
where
he
was
and
he
stayed
in
the
water
until
his
lips
and
were
blue
the
morning
after
that
he
was
too
ill
to
get
up
and
maclntyre
sent
for
a
doctor
he
has
always
been
so
perfectly
well
and
seemed
to
have
such
a
strong
constitution
that
i
can
not
allow
myself
to
believe
this
will
be
anything
serious
said
maclntyre
but
at
the
end
of
the
third
day
he
was
so
much
worse
that
she
sent
to
the
city
for
a
trained
nurse
and
telegraphed
for
his
father
and
mother
they
had
already
left
florida
and
were
yachting
up
the
atlantic
coast
on
their
way
home
when
the
message
reached
them
chapter
viii
fairchance
malcolm
did
his
best
to
atone
to
virginia
for
what
she
had
suffered
from
the
forgetfulness
of
the
two
little
indians
but
poor
keith
was
too
ill
to
remember
anything
about
it
he
did
not
know
his
father
and
mother
when
they
came
and
tossed
restlessly
about
talking
wildly
of
things
they
could
not
understand
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
ever
been
so
ill
and
as
they
watched
him
lying
there
day
after
day
burning
with
fever
and
growing
white
and
thin
a
great
fear
came
upon
them
that
he
would
never
be
any
better
no
one
put
that
fear
into
words
but
little
by
little
it
crept
from
heart
to
heart
like
a
wintry
fog
until
the
whole
house
felt
its
chill
the
sweet
spring
sounds
and
odours
came
rushing
in
at
every
window
from
the
sunny
world
outside
but
it
might
as
well
have
been
no
one
paid
any
heed
while
that
little
life
hung
in
the
balance
the
servants
went
through
the
house
on
tiptoe
malcolm
and
virginia
haunted
the
halls
to
discover
from
the
grave
faces
of
the
older
people
what
they
were
afraid
to
ask
and
maclntyre
was
kept
busy
answering
the
inquiries
of
the
neighbours
scarcely
an
hour
passed
that
some
one
did
not
come
to
ask
about
keith
to
leave
flowers
or
to
proffer
kindly
services
everybody
who
knew
the
little
fellow
loved
him
his
bright
smile
and
winning
manner
had
made
him
a
host
of
friends
there
was
no
lack
of
attention
his
father
and
mother
miss
allison
and
the
nurse
watched
every
breath
every
and
a
dozen
times
in
the
night
his
grandmother
stole
to
the
door
to
look
anxiously
at
the
wan
little
face
on
the
pillow
it
is
so
strange
said
his
mother
to
the
nurse
one
day
he
keeps
talking
about
a
white
flower
he
says
that
he
ca
right
the
wrong
unless
he
wears
it
and
that
jonesy
will
have
to
be
shut
up
and
never
find
his
brother
again
what
do
you
suppose
he
means
the
nurse
shook
her
head
she
did
not
know
just
then
maclntyre
heard
her
name
called
softly
elise
and
her
husband
beckoned
her
to
come
out
into
the
hall
i
want
to
show
you
something
in
room
he
said
leading
her
down
the
hall
to
his
sister
apartment
on
each
side
of
the
low
stood
a
large
photograph
one
of
malcolm
in
his
suit
of
mail
the
other
of
keith
in
the
costume
of
velvet
like
the
little
duke
of
gloster
oh
sydney
how
beautiful
she
exclaimed
as
she
swept
across
the
room
and
knelt
down
before
the
desk
for
a
better
view
leaning
her
arms
on
the
desk
she
looked
into
keith
pictured
face
with
hungry
eyes
he
lovely
she
repeated
oh
he
never
look
like
that
again
i
know
it
i
know
it
she
sobbed
remembering
how
white
was
the
little
face
on
the
pillow
that
she
had
just
left
maclntyre
bent
over
her
his
own
handsome
face
white
and
haggard
he
looked
ill
himself
from
the
constant
watching
and
anxiety
i
give
anything
in
the
world
that
i
own
everything
he
groaned
i
do
anything
sacrifice
anything
to
see
him
as
well
and
sturdy
as
he
looks
there
then
he
caught
up
the
picture
what
this
written
underneath
he
asked
it
is
in
keith
own
handwriting
pure
speak
truth
right
the
wrong
follow
the
king
else
wherefore
what
does
it
mean
allison
he
asked
turning
to
his
sister
who
was
resting
on
a
couch
by
the
window
it
is
written
under
picture
too
the
dear
little
sir
galahads
she
said
i
sent
for
you
to
tell
you
about
them
the
boys
intended
the
pictures
as
a
surprise
for
you
and
elise
so
we
never
sent
them
they
wanted
to
tell
you
themselves
about
the
benefit
and
the
little
waif
they
gave
it
for
she
took
a
little
pin
from
a
under
the
sofa
pillows
and
reaching
over
dropped
it
in
her
brother
hand
it
was
a
tiny
flower
of
white
enamel
with
a
diamond
dewdrop
in
the
centre
you
may
have
noticed
malcolm
wearing
one
like
it
she
said
and
then
she
told
them
the
story
of
jonesy
and
the
bear
and
all
that
their
coming
had
led
to
the
benefit
the
new
order
of
knighthood
and
the
awakening
of
the
boys
to
a
noble
purpose
the
boys
fully
expect
you
to
stand
by
them
in
all
this
sydney
she
said
in
conclusion
and
play
fairy
godfather
for
jonesy
henceforth
and
for
ever
one
night
when
keith
came
up
to
confess
some
mischief
he
had
been
into
during
the
day
he
said
allison
this
wearing
the
white
flower
of
a
blameless
life
as
easy
as
it
is
cracked
up
to
be
but
having
this
little
pin
helps
a
lot
i
just
put
my
hand
on
that
like
the
real
knights
used
to
do
on
their
and
repeat
my
motto
it
will
be
easier
when
papa
comes
home
since
i
known
jonesy
and
heard
him
tell
about
the
hard
times
some
people
have
that
he
knows
it
seems
to
me
there
an
awful
lot
of
wrong
in
the
world
for
somebody
to
set
right
some
nights
i
can
hardly
go
to
sleep
for
thinking
about
it
and
wishing
that
i
were
grown
up
so
that
i
could
begin
to
do
my
part
i
wish
papa
could
be
here
now
he
make
a
splendid
knight
he
is
so
big
and
good
and
handsome
i
king
arthur
himself
was
any
better
or
braver
than
my
father
is
a
tear
splashed
down
from
the
mother
eyes
as
she
listened
and
falling
on
the
tiny
white
flower
as
it
lay
in
her
husband
hand
glistened
beside
the
dewdrop
centre
like
another
diamond
oh
sydney
she
exclaimed
in
a
way
something
very
like
a
sob
shook
the
man
broad
shoulders
and
turning
abruptly
he
strode
out
of
the
room
down
in
the
dim
green
library
where
the
blinds
had
been
drawn
to
keep
it
cool
he
threw
himself
into
a
chair
beside
the
table
propping
keith
picture
up
in
front
of
him
against
a
pile
of
books
he
leaned
forward
gazing
at
it
earnestly
he
had
never
realised
before
how
much
he
loved
the
little
son
who
hour
by
hour
seemed
slowly
slipping
farther
away
from
him
the
pictured
face
looked
full
into
his
as
if
it
would
speak
it
wore
the
same
sweet
trustful
expression
that
had
shone
there
the
night
he
talked
to
jonesy
of
the
hall
of
the
shields
the
same
childish
purity
that
had
moved
the
old
professor
to
lay
his
hands
upon
his
head
and
call
him
galahad
all
that
gentle
birth
college
breeding
wealth
and
travel
could
give
a
man
were
sydney
maclntyre
and
yet
measuring
himself
by
standard
of
knighthood
he
felt
himself
sadly
lacking
he
had
given
liberally
to
charities
hundreds
of
dollars
because
it
was
often
easier
for
him
to
write
out
a
check
than
to
listen
to
somebody
tale
of
suffering
but
aside
from
that
he
had
left
the
old
world
to
wag
on
as
best
it
could
with
its
grievous
load
of
wrong
and
sorrow
a
man
is
not
apt
to
trouble
himself
as
to
how
it
wags
for
those
outside
his
circle
of
friends
when
the
generations
before
him
have
spent
their
time
laying
up
a
fortune
for
him
to
enjoy
but
this
man
was
beginning
to
trouble
himself
about
it
now
as
he
paced
restlessly
up
and
down
the
room
he
was
not
thinking
now
about
the
things
that
usually
occupied
him
his
social
duties
his
home
or
club
or
yacht
or
horses
or
kennels
he
was
not
planning
some
new
pleasure
for
his
friends
or
family
he
was
wondering
what
he
could
do
to
be
worthy
of
the
exalted
regard
in
which
he
was
held
by
his
little
sons
what
wrong
could
he
set
right
to
prove
himself
really
as
noble
as
they
thought
him
he
was
their
ideal
of
all
that
was
generous
and
manly
and
yet
what
have
i
ever
done
he
asked
himself
to
make
them
think
so
if
i
were
to
be
taken
out
of
the
world
i
would
be
leaving
it
exactly
as
i
found
it
who
could
point
to
my
coffin
and
say
are
better
politics
are
purer
or
times
are
not
so
hard
for
the
masses
now
because
this
one
man
willed
to
lift
up
his
fellows
as
far
as
the
might
of
one
strong
life
can
reach
but
they
will
say
that
of
malcolm
and
keith
if
he
lives
ah
if
he
lives
an
hour
later
the
door
opened
and
malcolm
came
in
softly
keith
is
asking
for
you
papa
he
said
with
a
timid
glance
into
his
haggard
face
then
he
came
nearer
and
slipped
his
hand
into
the
strong
fingers
and
together
they
went
up
the
stairs
to
answer
the
summons
did
you
want
me
keith
the
head
did
not
turn
on
the
pillow
the
languid
eyes
opened
only
but
there
was
recognition
in
them
now
and
one
little
hand
was
raised
to
lay
itself
lovingly
against
his
father
cheek
what
is
it
son
the
weak
little
voice
tried
to
answer
but
the
words
came
only
in
gasps
brother
knows
about
jonesy
keep
him
from
being
a
tramp
please
let
me
papa
do
that
much
good
in
my
life
wherefore
born
what
is
it
keith
asked
his
father
bending
over
him
papa
exactly
understand
but
you
can
have
anything
you
want
my
boy
anything
i
do
whatever
you
ask
malcolm
knows
was
the
answer
then
the
voice
seemed
somewhat
stronger
for
an
instant
and
a
faint
smile
touched
keith
lips
give
my
half
of
the
bear
to
ginger
now
may
i
have
my
white
flower
throwing
back
his
coat
his
father
unpinned
the
little
badge
from
his
vest
where
he
had
fastened
it
for
a
short
time
before
in
the
library
a
pleased
expression
flitted
over
the
child
face
as
he
saw
where
it
had
been
resting
and
when
it
was
fastened
in
the
front
of
his
little
embroidered
nightshirt
his
hand
closed
over
the
pin
as
if
it
were
something
very
precious
and
he
were
afraid
of
losing
it
again
wearing
the
white
flower
they
heard
him
whisper
and
then
the
little
knight
slept
it
was
hours
afterward
when
he
roused
again
hours
when
the
faintest
noise
had
not
been
allowed
in
the
house
when
the
servants
had
been
sent
to
the
cottage
and
unc
henry
stationed
at
the
front
gate
that
no
one
might
drive
up
the
avenue
virginia
in
a
hammock
on
the
veranda
scarcely
dared
draw
a
deep
breath
till
she
heard
the
doctor
coming
down
the
stairs
just
before
dark
then
she
knew
by
his
face
that
prayers
and
skill
and
tender
nursing
had
not
been
in
vain
and
that
keith
would
live
so
much
can
happen
in
a
week
in
the
seven
days
that
followed
keith
gradually
grew
strong
enough
to
be
propped
up
in
bed
a
little
while
at
a
time
captain
dudley
and
his
wife
came
home
from
cuba
and
maclntyre
began
to
carry
out
the
promise
he
had
made
to
keith
that
day
when
they
feared
most
he
could
not
live
the
whole
valley
rejoiced
in
the
first
and
second
happenings
and
were
too
much
occupied
in
them
to
notice
the
third
carriages
rolled
in
and
out
of
the
great
entrance
gate
all
day
long
for
dudley
had
always
been
a
favourite
with
the
old
neighbours
and
they
gave
a
warm
welcome
to
her
and
her
gallant
husband
virginia
followed
her
father
and
mother
about
like
a
loving
shadow
and
keith
was
so
interested
in
the
wonderful
stories
they
told
of
their
cuban
experiences
that
he
never
noticed
how
much
his
father
and
malcolm
were
away
from
home
sometimes
they
would
be
gone
all
day
together
consulting
with
the
old
professor
overseeing
carpenters
or
making
hasty
trips
to
the
city
jonesy
home
that
had
been
so
long
only
a
beautiful
was
rapidly
taking
shape
in
wood
and
stone
and
the
painters
would
soon
be
at
work
on
it
maclntyre
had
never
been
more
surprised
than
he
was
when
malcolm
unfolded
their
plan
to
him
it
did
not
seem
possible
that
two
children
could
have
thought
of
it
all
and
arranged
every
detail
without
the
help
of
some
older
head
it
just
grew
said
malcolm
in
explanation
first
keith
said
how
lovely
it
would
have
been
if
we
had
made
enough
money
at
the
benefit
to
have
bought
a
home
for
jonesy
in
the
country
where
he
could
have
a
fair
chance
to
grow
up
a
good
man
just
a
comfortable
little
cottage
with
a
garden
where
he
could
be
all
the
time
instead
of
in
the
dirty
city
streets
then
nobody
could
call
him
a
of
the
any
more
then
we
said
it
would
be
better
if
there
were
some
fields
back
of
the
garden
so
that
he
could
learn
to
be
a
farmer
when
he
was
older
and
have
some
way
to
make
a
living
we
talked
about
it
every
night
when
we
went
to
bed
and
kept
putting
a
little
more
and
a
little
more
to
it
until
it
was
as
real
to
us
as
if
we
had
truly
seen
such
a
place
there
were
vines
on
the
porches
and
a
big
newfoundland
dog
on
the
front
steps
and
a
cow
and
calf
in
the
pasture
and
a
gentle
old
horse
that
could
plough
and
that
jonesy
could
ride
to
water
we
told
ginger
and
she
thought
of
a
lot
more
things
some
little
speckled
pigs
in
a
pen
and
kittens
in
the
and
ducks
on
the
pond
and
an
orchard
and
roses
in
the
yard
she
said
we
ought
to
call
the
place
because
that
what
it
would
mean
for
jonesy
and
barney
you
know
we
would
send
for
barney
first
thing
we
did
of
course
and
it
was
ginger
who
first
thought
of
getting
some
nice
man
and
his
wife
to
take
care
of
the
boys
she
said
there
are
plenty
of
people
who
would
be
glad
to
do
it
just
for
the
sake
of
having
such
a
good
home
ginger
said
if
we
could
do
all
that
and
keep
jonesy
and
his
brother
from
growing
up
to
be
tramps
like
the
man
we
bought
the
bear
from
it
would
be
serving
our
country
just
as
much
as
if
we
went
to
war
and
fought
for
it
ginger
is
a
crank
about
being
a
patriot
you
ought
to
hear
her
talk
about
it
and
aunt
allison
said
that
ounce
of
prevention
is
worth
a
pound
of
cure
and
that
to
build
such
a
place
as
our
would
be
a
deed
worthy
of
any
true
knight
how
are
you
expecting
to
bring
this
wonderful
thing
to
pass
asked
his
father
as
malcolm
stopped
to
take
breath
do
you
expect
to
wave
a
wand
and
see
it
spring
up
out
of
the
earth
of
course
not
papa
said
malcolm
a
little
provoked
by
his
teasing
smile
we
were
going
to
ask
you
to
let
us
take
the
money
that
grandfather
left
us
in
his
will
we
wo
need
it
when
we
are
grown
for
we
can
earn
plenty
ourselves
then
and
it
seems
too
bad
to
have
it
laid
away
doing
nobody
any
good
when
we
need
it
so
much
now
to
right
this
wrong
of
jonesy
but
it
is
not
laid
away
answered
macintyre
it
is
invested
in
such
a
way
that
it
is
earning
you
more
money
every
year
and
more
than
that
it
was
left
in
trust
for
you
so
that
it
can
not
be
touched
until
you
are
oh
papa
cried
malcolm
bitterly
disappointed
he
had
hard
work
to
keep
back
the
tears
for
a
moment
then
a
happy
thought
made
his
face
brighten
you
could
lend
us
the
money
and
we
would
pay
you
back
when
we
are
of
age
you
know
you
promised
keith
you
would
do
anything
he
wanted
and
that
is
what
he
was
trying
to
ask
for
maclntyre
put
his
arm
around
the
earnest
little
fellow
and
drew
him
to
his
knee
smiling
down
into
the
upturned
face
that
waited
eagerly
for
his
answer
i
only
asked
that
to
hear
what
you
would
say
my
son
was
the
answer
you
need
have
no
worry
about
the
money
i
keep
my
promise
to
keith
and
jonesy
shall
have
his
home
i
not
a
knight
but
i
proud
to
be
the
father
of
two
such
valiant
champions
please
god
you
not
be
alone
in
your
battles
after
this
to
right
the
world
wrongs
i
be
your
faithful
squire
or
as
we
say
in
these
days
a
sort
of
silent
partner
in
the
enterprise
several
days
after
this
a
deed
was
recorded
in
the
county
conveying
a
large
piece
of
property
from
old
colonel
lloyd
to
malcolm
and
keith
maclntyre
it
was
the
place
adjoining
the
locusts
on
which
stood
a
fine
old
homestead
that
had
been
vacant
for
several
years
the
day
after
its
purchase
a
force
of
carpenters
and
painters
were
set
to
work
and
two
coloured
men
began
clearing
out
the
tangle
of
bushes
in
the
garden
jonesy
know
nothing
of
what
was
going
on
and
wondered
at
the
long
conversations
which
took
place
between
the
old
professor
and
maclntyre
always
in
german
it
was
the
professor
who
found
some
one
to
take
care
of
the
home
as
virginia
had
suggested
he
recommended
a
countryman
of
his
carl
sudsberger
who
had
long
been
a
teacher
like
himself
he
was
a
gentle
old
soul
who
loved
children
and
understood
them
and
a
more
motherly
creature
than
his
wife
could
not
well
be
imagined
everything
throve
under
her
thrifty
management
and
she
had
no
patience
with
laziness
or
waste
any
boy
in
whose
bringing
up
she
had
a
hand
would
be
able
to
make
his
way
in
the
world
when
the
time
came
for
it
dudley
and
miss
allison
helped
choose
the
furnishings
but
virginia
felt
that
the
pleasure
of
it
was
all
hers
for
she
was
taken
to
the
city
every
time
they
went
and
allowed
a
voice
in
everything
several
trips
were
necessary
before
the
house
was
complete
but
by
the
last
week
in
may
it
was
ready
from
attic
to
cellar
it
was
the
fairchance
that
the
boys
had
planned
so
long
with
its
paths
the
orchard
and
garden
and
outlying
fields
nothing
had
been
forgotten
from
the
big
newfoundland
dog
on
the
doorstep
to
the
ducks
on
the
pond
and
the
little
speckled
pigs
in
the
pen
the
day
that
keith
was
able
to
walk
for
the
first
time
maclntyre
went
to
chicago
taking
jonesy
with
him
to
find
barney
and
bring
him
back
he
was
gone
several
days
and
when
he
returned
there
were
three
boys
with
him
instead
of
two
jonesy
barney
and
a
little
fellow
about
five
years
old
still
in
dresses
malcolm
met
them
at
the
train
and
eyed
the
small
newcomer
with
curiosity
it
is
a
little
chap
that
barney
had
taken
under
his
wing
explained
maclntyre
its
mother
was
dead
and
i
found
it
was
entirely
dependent
on
barney
for
support
they
slept
together
in
the
same
cellar
and
shared
whatever
he
happened
to
earn
just
as
jonesy
did
i
had
the
heart
to
leave
him
behind
although
i
did
relish
the
idea
of
travelling
with
such
a
kindergarten
would
you
believe
it
dodds
that
the
little
fellow
name
saw
a
tree
in
his
until
yesterday
he
had
never
been
out
of
the
slums
where
he
was
born
not
even
to
the
avenues
of
the
city
where
he
could
have
seen
them
it
was
too
far
for
him
to
walk
alone
and
were
out
of
the
question
for
him
as
much
out
of
reach
of
his
empty
pockets
as
the
moon
never
saw
a
tree
echoed
malcolm
with
a
thrill
of
horror
in
his
voice
that
a
life
could
be
so
bare
in
its
knowledge
of
beauty
oh
papa
how
much
will
mean
to
him
then
oh
i
so
glad
and
keith
why
keith
will
want
to
stand
on
his
head
they
drove
directly
to
the
new
place
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
and
the
sunshine
threw
long
waving
shadows
across
the
yard
sudsberger
sat
on
the
front
porch
knitting
a
warm
breeze
blowing
in
from
the
garden
stirred
the
white
window
curtains
behind
her
with
soft
flutterings
the
coloured
woman
in
the
kitchen
was
singing
as
she
moved
around
preparing
supper
and
her
voice
floated
cheerily
around
the
corner
of
the
house
swing
low
sweet
chariot
comin
fer
to
carry
me
home
swing
low
sweet
comin
fer
to
carry
me
home
a
jersey
cow
lowed
at
the
pasture
bars
and
from
away
over
in
the
woodland
came
the
cooing
of
a
dove
three
little
waifs
had
found
a
home
maclntyre
looked
from
the
commonplace
countenances
of
the
boys
climbing
out
of
the
carriage
to
malcolm
noble
face
it
is
a
doubtful
experiment
he
said
to
himself
they
may
never
amount
to
anything
but
at
least
they
shall
have
a
chance
to
see
what
clean
honest
country
living
can
do
for
them
and
then
there
swept
across
his
heart
with
a
warm
generous
rush
the
impulse
to
do
as
much
for
every
other
unfortunate
child
he
could
reach
whose
only
heritage
is
the
poverty
and
crime
of
city
slums
he
had
seen
so
much
in
that
one
short
visit
the
misery
of
it
haunted
him
and
it
was
with
a
happiness
as
boyish
and
keen
as
malcolm
that
he
led
these
children
he
had
rescued
into
the
home
that
was
to
be
theirs
henceforth
keith
did
not
see
fairchance
until
memorial
day
then
they
took
him
over
in
the
carriage
in
the
afternoon
and
showed
him
every
nook
and
corner
of
the
place
there
were
six
boys
there
now
for
room
had
been
made
for
two
little
fellows
from
louisville
whom
maclntyre
had
found
at
the
newsboys
home
i
no
doubt
but
that
there
always
be
more
coming
he
said
to
sudsberger
with
a
smile
as
he
led
them
in
when
you
once
let
a
little
water
trickle
through
the
dyke
the
whole
sea
is
apt
to
come
pouring
in
happy
the
heart
that
is
swept
with
such
high
tides
answered
the
old
german
it
is
left
the
richer
by
such
floods
several
families
in
the
valley
were
invited
to
come
late
in
the
afternoon
to
a
the
great
silk
flag
was
virginia
gift
and
captain
dudley
made
the
presentation
speech
he
wore
his
uniform
in
honour
of
the
occasion
this
was
a
part
of
what
he
said
this
memorial
day
throughout
this
land
of
ours
over
every
mound
that
marks
a
soldier
dust
some
hand
is
stretched
to
drop
a
flower
in
tender
tribute
over
her
heroic
dead
a
grateful
country
wreathes
the
red
of
her
roses
the
white
of
her
lilies
and
the
blue
of
her
repeating
even
in
the
sweet
syllables
of
the
flowers
the
symbol
of
her
patriotism
the
red
white
and
blue
of
her
banner
my
friends
i
have
followed
the
old
flag
into
more
than
one
battle
i
have
seen
men
charge
after
it
through
blinding
smoke
and
hail
of
bullets
and
i
have
seen
them
die
for
it
no
one
feels
more
deeply
than
i
what
a
glorious
thing
it
is
to
die
for
one
country
but
i
want
to
say
to
these
little
lads
looking
up
at
this
great
flag
fluttering
over
us
that
it
is
not
half
so
noble
half
so
brave
as
to
live
for
it
to
give
yourselves
in
untiring
living
to
your
country
good
to
the
ends
thou
at
be
thy
country
thy
god
and
truth
i
would
rather
have
that
said
of
me
that
i
did
that
than
to
be
the
greatest
general
of
my
day
i
would
rather
be
the
founder
of
homes
like
this
one
than
to
manoeuvre
successfully
the
greatest
battles
may
the
little
knights
of
kentucky
go
on
out
through
the
land
carrying
their
motto
with
them
until
the
last
wrong
is
righted
and
wherever
the
old
flag
floats
a
chance
may
be
found
for
every
one
that
lives
beneath
it
and
may
these
stars
and
stripes
as
they
rise
and
fall
on
the
winds
of
this
peaceful
valley
whisper
continuously
that
same
motto
until
its
lessons
of
truth
and
purity
and
unselfish
service
have
been
blazoned
on
the
hearts
of
every
boy
who
calls
this
home
may
it
help
to
make
him
a
true
knight
in
his
country
cause
there
was
music
after
that
and
then
old
colonel
lloyd
made
a
speech
and
virginia
and
the
little
colonel
gathered
roses
out
of
the
old
garden
so
that
every
one
could
wear
a
bunch
a
little
later
they
had
supper
on
the
lawn
picnic
fashion
and
then
drove
home
in
the
cool
of
the
evening
when
all
the
meadows
were
full
of
soft
flashings
from
the
fairy
torches
of
a
million
fireflies
with
keith
safely
covered
up
in
a
hammock
they
lingered
on
the
porch
long
after
the
stars
came
out
and
the
dew
lay
heavy
on
the
roses
they
were
building
other
now
to
be
rebuilt
some
day
as
home
had
been
only
these
were
still
larger
and
better
the
older
people
were
planning
too
and
all
the
good
that
grew
out
of
that
quiet
evening
talk
can
never
be
known
until
that
day
comes
when
the
king
shall
read
all
the
names
in
his
hall
of
the
shields
it
has
been
such
a
beautiful
day
said
virginia
leaning
her
head
happily
against
her
mother
shoulder
then
she
started
up
suddenly
remembering
something
oh
papa
she
cried
let
end
it
as
they
do
at
the
fort
with
the
i
run
and
get
my
old
bugle
and
you
play
a
few
minutes
later
the
silvery
notes
went
floating
out
on
the
warm
night
air
through
all
the
peaceful
valley
over
the
mounds
in
the
little
churchyard
wreathed
now
with
their
fresh
memorial
roses
past
the
locusts
where
the
little
colonel
lay
over
the
woods
and
fields
they
floated
until
they
reached
the
flag
that
kept
its
fluttering
vigil
over
fairchance
jonesy
sat
up
in
bed
to
listen
many
a
reveille
would
sound
before
his
full
awakening
to
all
that
the
two
little
knights
had
made
possible
for
him
but
the
sweet
dim
dream
of
the
future
that
stole
into
his
grateful
little
heart
was
an
earnest
of
what
was
in
store
for
him
then
the
falling
through
the
starlight
like
a
benediction
closed
the
happy
day
with
its
peaceful
good
night
the
end
