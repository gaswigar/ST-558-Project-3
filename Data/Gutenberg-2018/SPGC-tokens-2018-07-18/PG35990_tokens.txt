it
seems
to
me
a
very
difficult
task
to
sit
down
at
a
desk
and
write
reminiscences
of
a
friend
who
has
gone
from
us
all
it
is
not
easy
to
make
an
effort
and
to
remember
all
the
little
personalia
of
some
one
one
has
loved
very
much
and
by
whom
one
has
been
loved
and
yet
it
is
in
a
measure
one
duty
to
tell
the
world
something
of
the
inner
life
of
a
famous
man
and
lewis
carroll
was
so
wonderful
a
personality
and
so
good
a
man
that
if
my
pen
dragged
ever
so
slowly
i
feel
that
i
can
at
least
tell
something
of
his
life
which
is
worthy
the
telling
writing
with
the
sense
of
his
loss
still
heavy
upon
me
i
must
of
necessity
colour
my
account
with
sadness
i
am
not
in
the
ordinary
sense
a
biographer
i
can
not
set
down
a
critical
estimate
a
cold
dispassionate
of
a
man
i
loved
but
i
can
write
of
a
few
things
that
happened
when
i
was
a
little
girl
and
when
he
used
to
say
to
me
that
i
was
little
girl
the
gracious
presence
of
lewis
carroll
is
with
us
no
longer
never
again
will
his
hand
hold
mine
and
i
shall
never
hear
his
voice
more
in
this
world
forever
while
i
live
that
kindly
influence
will
be
gone
from
my
life
and
the
friend
of
little
children
has
left
us
and
yet
in
the
full
sorrow
of
it
all
i
find
some
note
of
comfort
he
was
so
good
and
sweet
so
tender
and
kind
so
certain
that
there
was
another
and
more
beautiful
life
waiting
for
us
that
i
know
even
as
if
i
heard
him
telling
it
to
me
that
some
time
i
shall
meet
him
once
more
in
all
the
noise
and
excitement
of
london
amid
all
the
distractions
of
a
stage
life
i
know
this
and
his
presence
is
often
very
near
to
me
and
the
kindly
voice
is
often
at
my
ear
as
it
was
in
the
old
days
to
have
even
known
such
a
man
as
he
was
is
an
inestimable
boon
to
have
been
with
him
for
so
long
as
a
child
to
have
known
so
intimately
the
man
who
above
all
others
has
understood
childhood
is
indeed
a
memory
on
which
to
look
back
with
thanksgiving
and
with
tears
now
that
i
am
no
longer
his
little
girl
now
that
he
is
dead
and
my
life
is
so
different
from
the
quiet
life
he
led
i
can
yet
feel
the
old
charm
i
can
still
be
glad
that
he
has
kissed
me
and
that
we
were
friends
little
girl
and
grave
professor
it
is
a
strange
combination
grave
professor
and
little
girl
how
curious
it
sounds
yet
strange
and
curious
as
it
may
seem
it
was
so
and
the
little
girl
now
a
little
girl
no
longer
offers
this
last
loving
tribute
to
the
friend
and
teacher
she
loved
so
well
forever
that
voice
is
still
be
it
mine
to
revive
some
ancient
memories
of
it
first
however
as
i
have
essayed
to
be
some
sort
of
a
biographer
i
feel
that
before
i
let
my
pen
run
easily
over
the
tale
of
my
intimate
knowledge
of
lewis
carroll
i
must
put
down
very
shortly
some
facts
about
his
life
the
rev
charles
lutwidge
dodgson
died
when
he
was
years
old
and
when
his
famous
book
alice
in
wonderland
had
been
published
for
years
he
was
born
at
daresbury
in
cheshire
and
his
father
was
the
rev
charles
dodgson
the
first
years
of
his
life
were
spent
at
daresbury
but
afterwards
the
family
went
to
live
at
a
place
called
croft
in
yorkshire
he
went
first
to
a
private
school
in
yorkshire
and
then
to
rugby
where
he
spent
years
that
he
always
remembered
as
very
happy
ones
in
he
went
to
christ
church
oxford
and
from
that
time
till
the
year
of
his
death
he
was
inseparably
connected
with
the
house
as
christ
church
college
is
generally
called
from
its
latin
name
ædes
christi
which
means
literally
translated
the
house
of
christ
there
he
won
great
distinction
as
a
scholar
of
mathematics
and
wrote
many
abstruse
and
learned
books
very
different
from
alice
in
wonderland
there
is
a
tale
that
when
the
queen
had
read
alice
in
wonderland
she
was
so
pleased
that
she
asked
for
more
books
by
the
same
author
lewis
carroll
was
written
to
and
back
with
the
name
of
charles
dodgson
on
the
came
a
number
of
the
very
dryest
books
about
algebra
and
euclid
that
you
can
imagine
still
even
in
mathematics
his
whimsical
fancy
was
sometimes
suffered
to
peep
out
and
little
girls
who
learnt
the
rudiments
of
calculation
at
his
knee
found
the
path
they
had
imagined
so
thorny
set
about
with
roses
by
reason
of
the
delightful
fun
with
which
he
would
turn
a
task
into
a
joy
but
when
the
fun
was
over
the
little
girl
would
find
that
she
had
learnt
the
lesson
all
unknowingly
just
the
same
happy
little
girls
who
had
such
a
master
the
old
rhyme
multiplication
is
vexation
division
is
as
bad
the
rule
of
three
doth
puzzle
me
and
practice
drives
me
mad
would
never
need
to
have
been
written
had
all
arithmetic
lessons
been
like
the
arithmetic
lessons
given
by
charles
dodgson
to
his
little
friends
as
a
lecturer
to
his
pupils
he
was
also
surprisingly
lucid
and
under
his
deft
treatment
the
knottiest
of
problems
were
quickly
smoothed
out
and
made
easy
for
his
hearers
to
comprehend
i
always
hated
mathematics
at
school
an
of
his
told
me
a
little
while
ago
but
when
i
went
up
to
oxford
i
learnt
from
dodgson
to
look
upon
my
mathematics
as
the
most
delightful
of
all
my
studies
his
lectures
were
never
dry
for
years
he
lectured
at
oxford
finally
giving
up
his
post
in
from
that
time
to
the
time
of
his
death
he
remained
in
his
college
taking
no
actual
part
in
the
tuition
but
still
enjoying
the
fellowship
that
he
had
won
in
this
is
an
official
account
a
brief
sketch
of
an
intensely
interesting
life
it
tells
little
save
that
lewis
carroll
was
a
clever
mathematician
and
a
sympathetic
teacher
it
shall
be
my
work
to
present
him
as
he
was
from
a
more
human
point
of
view
lewis
carroll
was
a
man
of
medium
height
when
i
knew
him
his
hair
was
a
rather
longer
than
it
was
the
fashion
to
wear
and
his
eyes
were
a
deep
blue
he
was
clean
shaven
and
as
he
walked
always
seemed
a
little
unsteady
in
his
gait
at
oxford
he
was
a
figure
he
was
a
little
eccentric
in
his
clothes
in
the
coldest
weather
he
would
never
wear
an
overcoat
and
he
had
a
curious
habit
of
always
wearing
in
all
seasons
of
the
year
a
pair
of
grey
and
black
cotton
gloves
but
for
the
whiteness
of
his
hair
it
was
difficult
to
tell
his
age
from
his
face
for
there
were
no
wrinkles
on
it
he
had
a
curiously
womanish
face
and
in
direct
contradiction
to
his
real
character
there
seemed
to
be
little
strength
in
it
one
reads
a
great
deal
about
the
lines
that
a
man
life
paints
in
his
face
and
there
are
many
people
who
believe
that
character
is
indicated
by
the
curves
of
flesh
and
bone
i
do
not
and
never
shall
believe
it
is
true
and
lewis
carroll
is
only
one
of
many
instances
to
support
my
theory
he
was
as
firm
and
as
a
man
may
be
but
there
was
little
to
show
it
in
his
face
yet
you
could
easily
discern
it
in
the
way
in
which
he
met
and
talked
with
his
friends
when
he
shook
hands
with
you
he
had
firm
white
hands
rather
large
his
grip
was
strong
and
steadfast
every
one
knows
the
kind
of
man
of
whom
it
is
said
his
hands
were
all
soft
and
flabby
when
he
said
well
lewis
carroll
was
not
a
bit
like
that
every
one
says
when
he
shook
your
hand
the
pressure
of
his
was
full
of
strength
and
you
felt
here
indeed
was
a
man
to
admire
and
to
love
the
expression
in
his
eyes
was
also
very
kind
and
charming
illustration
lewis
carroll
room
in
oxford
in
which
alice
in
wonderland
was
written
he
used
to
look
at
me
when
we
met
in
the
very
tenderest
gentlest
way
of
course
on
an
ordinary
occasion
i
knew
that
his
interested
glance
did
not
mean
anything
of
any
extra
importance
nothing
could
have
happened
since
i
had
seen
him
last
yet
at
the
same
time
his
look
was
always
so
deeply
sympathetic
and
benevolent
that
one
could
hardly
help
feeling
it
meant
a
great
deal
more
than
the
expression
of
the
ordinary
man
he
was
afflicted
with
what
i
believe
is
known
as
housemaid
knee
and
this
made
his
movements
singularly
jerky
and
abrupt
then
again
he
found
it
impossible
to
avoid
stammering
in
his
speech
he
would
when
engaged
in
an
animated
conversation
with
a
friend
talk
quickly
and
well
for
a
few
minutes
and
then
suddenly
and
without
any
very
apparent
cause
would
begin
to
stutter
so
much
that
it
was
often
difficult
to
understand
him
he
was
very
conscious
of
this
impediment
and
he
tried
hard
to
cure
himself
for
several
years
he
read
a
scene
from
some
play
of
every
day
aloud
but
despite
this
he
was
never
quite
able
to
cure
himself
of
the
habit
many
people
would
have
found
this
a
great
hindrance
to
the
affairs
of
ordinary
life
and
would
have
felt
it
deeply
lewis
carroll
was
different
his
mind
and
life
were
so
simple
and
open
that
there
was
no
room
in
them
for
and
i
have
often
heard
him
jest
at
his
own
misfortune
with
a
comic
wonder
at
it
the
personal
characteristic
that
you
would
notice
most
on
meeting
lewis
carroll
was
his
extreme
shyness
with
children
of
course
he
was
not
nearly
so
reserved
but
in
the
society
of
people
of
maturer
age
he
was
almost
prim
in
his
manner
when
he
knew
a
child
well
this
reserve
would
vanish
completely
but
it
needed
only
a
slightly
disconcerting
incident
to
bring
the
cloak
of
shyness
about
him
once
more
and
close
the
lips
that
just
before
had
been
talking
so
delightfully
i
shall
never
forget
one
afternoon
when
we
had
been
walking
in
christ
church
meadows
on
one
side
of
the
great
open
space
the
little
river
cherwell
runs
through
groves
of
trees
towards
the
isis
where
the
college
are
rowed
we
were
going
quietly
along
by
the
side
of
the
cher
when
he
began
to
explain
to
me
that
the
tiny
stream
was
a
tributary
a
baby
river
he
put
it
of
the
big
thames
he
talked
for
some
minutes
explaining
how
rivers
came
down
from
hills
and
flowed
eventually
to
the
sea
when
he
suddenly
met
a
brother
don
at
a
turning
in
the
avenue
he
was
holding
my
hand
and
giving
me
my
lesson
in
geography
with
great
earnestness
when
the
other
man
came
round
the
corner
illustration
dodgson
he
greeted
him
in
answer
to
his
salutation
but
the
incident
disturbed
his
train
of
thought
and
for
the
rest
of
the
walk
he
became
very
difficult
to
understand
and
talked
in
a
nervous
and
preoccupied
manner
one
strange
way
in
which
his
nervousness
affected
him
was
peculiarly
characteristic
when
owing
to
the
stupendous
success
of
alice
in
wonderland
and
alice
through
the
he
became
a
celebrity
many
people
were
anxious
to
see
him
and
in
some
way
or
other
to
find
out
what
manner
of
man
he
was
this
seemed
to
him
horrible
and
he
invented
a
mild
deception
for
use
when
some
or
curious
person
sent
him
a
request
for
his
signature
on
a
photograph
or
asked
him
some
silly
question
as
to
the
writing
of
one
of
his
books
how
long
it
took
to
write
and
how
many
copies
had
been
sold
through
some
third
person
he
always
represented
that
lewis
carroll
the
author
and
dodgson
the
professor
were
two
distinct
persons
and
that
the
author
could
not
be
heard
of
at
oxford
at
all
on
one
occasion
an
american
actually
wrote
to
say
that
he
had
heard
that
lewis
carroll
had
laid
out
a
garden
to
represent
some
of
the
scenes
in
alice
in
wonderland
and
that
he
the
american
was
coming
right
away
to
take
photographs
of
it
poor
lewis
carroll
he
was
in
terror
of
americans
for
a
week
of
being
photographed
he
had
a
horror
and
despite
the
fact
that
he
was
continually
and
importunately
requested
to
sit
before
the
camera
only
very
few
photographs
of
him
are
in
existence
yet
he
had
been
himself
a
great
amateur
photographer
and
had
taken
many
pictures
that
were
remarkable
in
their
exact
portraiture
of
the
subject
it
was
this
exactness
that
he
used
to
pride
himself
on
in
his
camera
work
he
always
said
that
modern
professional
photographers
spoilt
all
their
pictures
by
touching
them
up
absurdly
to
flatter
the
sitter
when
it
was
necessary
for
me
to
have
some
pictures
taken
he
sent
me
to
cameron
whom
he
declared
to
be
the
only
artist
who
dared
to
produce
a
photograph
that
was
exactly
like
its
subject
this
is
one
of
the
photographs
of
me
that
cameron
took
and
lewis
carroll
always
declared
that
it
was
a
perfect
specimen
of
portrait
work
many
of
the
photographs
of
children
in
this
book
are
lewis
carroll
work
miss
beatrice
hatch
to
whose
kindness
i
am
indebted
for
these
photographs
and
for
much
interesting
information
writes
in
the
april
my
earliest
recollections
of
dodgson
are
connected
with
photography
he
was
very
fond
of
this
art
at
one
time
though
he
had
entirely
given
it
up
for
many
years
latterly
he
kept
various
costumes
and
with
which
to
dress
us
up
and
of
course
that
added
to
the
fun
what
child
would
not
thoroughly
enjoy
personating
a
japanese
or
a
beggar
child
or
a
gipsy
or
an
indian
sometimes
there
were
excursions
to
the
roof
of
the
college
which
was
easily
accessible
from
the
windows
of
the
studio
or
you
might
stand
by
your
friend
side
in
the
tiny
dark
room
and
watch
him
while
he
poured
the
contents
of
several
little
bottles
on
to
the
glass
picture
of
yourself
that
looked
so
funny
with
its
black
face
illustration
a
chinaman
yet
despite
his
love
for
the
photographer
art
he
hated
the
idea
of
having
his
own
picture
taken
for
the
benefit
of
a
curious
world
the
shyness
that
made
him
nervous
in
the
presence
of
strangers
made
the
idea
that
any
one
who
cared
to
stare
into
a
shop
window
could
examine
and
criticise
his
portrait
extremely
repulsive
to
him
i
remember
that
this
shyness
of
his
was
the
only
occasion
of
anything
approaching
a
quarrel
between
us
i
had
an
idle
trick
of
drawing
caricatures
when
i
was
a
child
and
one
day
when
he
was
writing
some
letters
i
began
to
make
a
picture
of
him
on
the
back
of
an
envelope
i
quite
forget
what
the
drawing
was
like
probably
it
was
an
abominable
libel
but
suddenly
he
turned
round
and
saw
what
i
was
doing
he
got
up
from
his
seat
and
turned
very
red
frightening
me
very
much
then
he
took
my
poor
little
drawing
and
tearing
it
into
small
pieces
threw
it
into
the
fire
without
a
word
afterwards
he
came
suddenly
to
me
and
saying
nothing
caught
me
up
in
his
arms
and
kissed
me
passionately
i
was
only
some
ten
or
eleven
years
of
age
at
the
time
but
now
the
incident
comes
back
to
me
very
clearly
and
i
can
see
it
as
if
it
happened
but
yesterday
the
sudden
snatching
of
my
picture
the
hurried
striding
across
the
room
and
then
the
tender
light
in
his
face
as
he
caught
me
up
to
him
and
kissed
me
i
used
to
see
a
good
deal
of
him
at
oxford
and
i
was
constantly
in
christ
church
he
would
invite
me
to
stay
with
him
and
find
me
rooms
just
outside
the
college
gates
where
i
was
put
into
charge
of
an
elderly
dame
whose
name
if
i
do
not
forget
was
buxall
i
would
spend
long
happy
days
with
my
uncle
and
at
nine
i
was
taken
over
to
the
little
house
in
aldates
and
delivered
into
the
hands
of
the
landlady
who
put
me
to
bed
in
the
morning
i
was
awakened
by
the
deep
reverberations
of
great
tom
calling
oxford
to
wake
and
begin
the
new
day
those
times
were
very
pleasant
and
the
remembrance
of
them
lingers
with
me
still
lewis
carroll
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
had
two
tiny
turret
rooms
one
on
each
side
of
his
staircase
in
christ
church
he
always
used
to
tell
me
that
when
i
grew
up
and
became
married
he
would
give
me
the
two
little
rooms
so
that
if
i
ever
disagreed
with
my
husband
we
could
each
of
us
retire
to
a
turret
till
we
had
made
up
our
quarrel
and
those
rooms
of
his
i
do
not
think
there
was
ever
such
a
for
children
i
am
sure
they
must
have
contained
one
of
the
finest
collections
of
to
be
found
anywhere
in
the
world
there
were
big
black
ebony
boxes
with
glass
tops
through
which
you
could
see
all
the
works
there
was
a
big
box
with
a
handle
which
it
was
quite
hard
exercise
for
a
little
girl
to
turn
and
there
must
have
been
twenty
or
thirty
little
ones
which
could
only
play
one
tune
sometimes
one
of
the
would
not
play
properly
and
then
i
always
got
tremendously
excited
uncle
used
to
go
to
a
drawer
in
the
table
and
produce
a
box
of
little
and
punches
and
while
i
sat
on
his
knee
he
would
unscrew
the
lid
and
take
out
the
wheels
to
see
what
was
the
matter
he
must
have
been
a
clever
mechanist
for
the
result
was
always
the
a
longer
or
shorter
period
the
music
began
again
sometimes
when
the
had
played
all
their
tunes
he
used
to
put
them
in
the
box
backwards
and
was
as
pleased
as
i
at
the
comic
effect
of
the
music
standing
on
its
head
as
he
phrased
it
there
was
another
and
very
wonderful
toy
which
he
sometimes
produced
for
me
and
this
was
known
as
the
bat
the
ceilings
of
the
rooms
in
which
he
lived
at
the
time
were
very
high
indeed
and
admirably
suited
for
the
purposes
of
the
bat
it
was
an
ingeniously
constructed
toy
of
gauze
and
wire
which
actually
flew
about
the
room
like
a
bat
it
was
worked
by
a
piece
of
twisted
elastic
and
it
could
fly
for
about
half
a
minute
i
was
always
a
little
afraid
of
this
toy
because
it
was
too
lifelike
but
there
was
a
fearful
joy
in
it
when
the
began
to
pall
he
would
get
up
from
his
chair
and
look
at
me
with
a
knowing
smile
i
always
knew
what
was
coming
even
before
he
began
to
speak
and
i
used
to
dance
up
and
down
in
tremendous
anticipation
isa
my
darling
he
would
say
once
upon
a
time
there
was
some
one
called
bob
the
bat
and
he
lived
in
the
top
drawer
of
the
what
could
he
do
when
uncle
wound
him
up
and
then
i
would
squeak
out
breathlessly
he
could
really
fly
bob
the
bat
had
many
adventures
there
was
no
way
of
controlling
the
direction
of
its
flight
and
one
morning
a
hot
summer
morning
when
the
window
was
wide
open
bob
flew
out
into
the
garden
and
alighted
in
a
bowl
of
salad
which
a
scout
was
taking
to
some
one
rooms
the
poor
fellow
was
so
startled
by
the
sudden
flapping
apparition
that
he
dropped
the
bowl
and
it
was
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
there
i
have
written
a
thousand
pieces
and
a
thoughtless
exaggeration
of
that
sort
was
a
thing
that
lewis
carroll
hated
a
thousand
pieces
he
would
have
said
you
know
isa
that
if
the
bowl
had
been
broken
into
a
thousand
pieces
they
would
each
have
been
so
tiny
that
you
could
have
hardly
seen
them
and
if
the
broken
pieces
had
been
he
would
have
made
me
count
them
as
a
means
of
impressing
on
my
mind
the
folly
of
needless
exaggeration
i
remember
how
annoyed
he
was
once
when
after
a
morning
sea
bathing
at
eastbourne
i
exclaimed
oh
this
salt
water
it
always
makes
my
hair
as
stiff
as
a
poker
he
impressed
it
on
me
quite
irritably
that
no
little
girl
hair
could
ever
possibly
get
as
stiff
as
a
poker
if
you
had
said
stiff
as
wires
it
would
have
been
more
like
it
but
even
that
would
have
been
an
exaggeration
and
then
seeing
that
i
was
a
little
frightened
he
drew
for
me
a
picture
of
the
little
girl
called
isa
whose
hair
turned
into
pokers
because
she
was
always
exaggerating
things
that
and
all
the
other
pictures
that
he
drew
for
me
are
i
sorry
to
say
the
sole
property
of
the
little
fishes
in
the
irish
channel
where
a
clumsy
porter
dropped
them
as
we
hurried
into
the
boat
at
holyhead
i
nearly
died
of
laughing
was
another
expression
that
he
particularly
disliked
in
fact
any
form
of
exaggeration
generally
called
from
him
a
reproof
though
he
was
sometimes
content
to
make
fun
for
instance
my
sisters
and
i
had
sent
him
millions
of
kisses
in
a
letter
below
you
will
find
the
letter
that
he
wrote
in
return
written
in
violet
ink
that
he
always
used
dreadfully
ugly
i
used
to
think
it
illustration
ch
ch
oxford
my
own
darling
it
all
very
well
for
you
and
nellie
and
emsie
to
write
in
millions
of
hugs
and
kisses
but
please
consider
the
it
would
occupy
your
poor
old
very
busy
uncle
try
hugging
and
kissing
emsie
for
a
minute
by
the
watch
and
i
do
think
you
manage
it
more
than
times
a
minute
must
mean
millions
at
least
hugs
and
kisses
minutes
hours
days
at
twelve
hours
a
day
weeks
i
could
go
on
hugging
and
kissing
more
than
hours
a
day
and
i
would
like
to
spend
that
way
so
you
see
it
would
take
of
hard
work
really
my
dear
child
i
spare
the
why
have
i
written
since
my
last
letter
why
how
i
you
silly
silly
child
how
could
i
have
written
the
last
i
write
now
you
just
try
it
with
kissing
go
and
kiss
nellie
from
me
several
times
and
take
care
to
manage
it
so
as
to
have
kissed
her
the
last
you
kiss
her
now
go
back
to
your
place
and
i
question
you
you
kissed
her
several
times
darling
uncle
was
it
when
you
gave
her
the
kiss
minutes
past
uncle
well
now
have
you
kissed
her
i
ahem
ahem
ahem
excuse
me
uncle
i
got
a
bad
cough
i
think
that
i
that
is
you
know
i
i
see
isa
begins
with
i
and
it
seems
to
me
as
if
she
was
going
to
with
i
time
anyhow
my
not
writing
has
been
because
i
was
but
because
i
was
a
horrid
lazy
old
thing
who
kept
putting
it
off
from
day
to
day
till
at
last
i
said
to
myself
roar
there
no
time
to
write
now
because
they
on
the
of
april
in
fact
i
have
been
a
bit
surprised
if
this
letter
had
been
from
instead
of
louisville
well
i
suppose
you
be
there
by
about
the
middle
of
may
but
mind
you
do
write
to
me
from
there
please
no
more
horrid
letters
from
you
i
hate
them
so
and
as
for
them
when
i
get
them
why
i
just
as
soon
kiss
kiss
kiss
you
tiresome
thing
so
there
now
thank
you
very
much
for
those
photographs
i
liked
them
hum
well
i
ca
honestly
say
i
thought
them
the
very
best
i
had
ever
seen
please
give
my
kindest
regards
to
your
mother
and
of
a
kiss
to
nellie
and
a
kiss
to
emsie
and
a
kiss
to
yourself
so
with
fondest
love
i
am
my
darling
your
loving
uncle
l
dodgson
and
now
in
the
postscript
comes
one
of
the
rare
instances
in
which
lewis
carroll
showed
his
deep
religious
feeling
it
runs
i
thought
about
that
little
prayer
you
asked
me
to
write
for
nellie
and
emsie
but
i
would
like
first
to
have
the
words
of
the
one
i
wrote
for
and
the
words
of
what
they
say
if
they
say
any
and
then
i
will
pray
to
our
heavenly
father
to
help
me
to
write
a
prayer
that
will
be
really
fit
for
them
to
use
again
i
had
ended
one
of
my
letters
with
all
join
me
in
lufs
and
kisses
it
was
a
letter
written
when
i
was
away
from
home
and
alone
and
i
had
put
the
usual
ending
thoughtlessly
and
in
haste
for
there
was
no
one
that
i
knew
in
all
that
town
who
could
have
joined
me
in
my
messages
to
him
he
answered
me
as
follows
lushington
road
eastbourne
oh
you
naughty
naughty
bad
wicked
little
girl
you
forgot
to
put
a
stamp
on
your
letter
and
your
poor
old
uncle
had
to
pay
twopence
his
twopence
think
of
that
i
shall
punish
you
severely
for
this
when
once
i
get
you
here
so
do
you
hear
be
good
enough
to
tremble
i
only
time
for
one
question
who
in
the
world
are
the
that
join
you
in
and
kisses
were
you
fancying
you
were
at
home
and
sending
messages
as
people
constantly
do
from
nellie
and
emsie
without
their
having
given
any
it
is
a
good
plan
that
sending
messages
people
have
given
i
do
mean
it
in
the
least
because
everybody
knows
how
commonly
they
are
sent
without
having
been
given
but
it
lessens
the
pleasure
of
receiving
the
messages
my
sisters
write
to
me
best
love
from
all
i
know
it
is
true
so
i
do
value
it
much
the
other
day
the
husband
of
one
of
my
who
always
writes
loving
wrote
to
me
and
ended
with
joins
me
in
kindest
regards
in
my
answer
i
said
of
course
in
fun
am
not
going
to
send
ethel
kindest
regards
so
i
wo
send
her
any
message
then
she
wrote
to
say
she
did
even
know
he
was
writing
course
i
would
have
sent
best
love
and
she
added
that
she
had
given
her
husband
a
piece
of
her
mind
poor
husband
your
always
loving
uncle
these
letters
are
written
in
lewis
carroll
ordinary
handwriting
not
a
particularly
legible
one
when
however
he
was
writing
for
the
press
no
characters
could
have
been
more
clearly
and
distinctly
formed
than
his
throughout
his
life
he
always
made
it
his
care
to
give
as
little
trouble
as
possible
to
other
people
why
should
the
printers
have
to
work
overtime
because
my
letters
are
and
my
words
run
into
each
other
he
once
said
when
a
friend
remonstrated
with
him
because
he
took
such
pains
with
the
writing
of
his
copy
as
a
specimen
of
his
careful
penmanship
the
diary
that
he
wrote
for
me
which
is
reproduced
in
this
book
in
facsimile
is
an
admirable
example
they
were
happy
days
those
days
in
oxford
spent
with
the
most
fascinating
companion
that
a
child
could
have
in
our
walks
about
the
old
town
in
our
visits
to
cathedral
or
chapel
or
hall
in
our
visits
to
his
friends
he
was
an
ideal
companion
but
i
think
i
was
almost
happiest
when
we
came
back
to
his
rooms
and
had
tea
alone
when
the
it
was
always
winter
when
i
stayed
in
oxford
threw
fantastic
shadows
about
the
quaint
room
and
the
thoughts
of
the
prosiest
of
people
must
have
wandered
a
little
into
the
shifting
firelight
seemed
to
almost
ætherealise
that
kindly
face
and
as
the
wonderful
stories
fell
from
his
lips
and
his
eyes
lighted
on
me
with
the
sweetest
smile
that
ever
a
man
wore
i
was
conscious
of
a
love
and
reverence
for
charles
dodgson
that
became
nearly
an
adoration
it
was
almost
pain
when
the
lights
were
turned
up
and
we
came
back
to
everyday
life
and
tea
he
was
very
particular
about
his
tea
which
he
always
made
himself
and
in
order
that
it
should
draw
properly
he
would
walk
about
the
room
swinging
the
from
side
to
side
for
exactly
ten
minutes
the
idea
of
the
grave
professor
promenading
his
study
and
carefully
waving
a
to
and
fro
may
seem
ridiculous
but
all
the
minutiæ
of
life
received
an
extreme
attention
at
his
hands
and
after
the
first
surprise
one
came
quickly
to
realise
the
convenience
that
his
carefulness
ensured
illustration
beggar
children
before
starting
on
a
railway
journey
for
instance
and
how
delightful
were
railway
journeys
in
the
company
of
lewis
carroll
he
used
to
map
out
exactly
every
minute
of
the
time
that
we
were
to
take
on
the
way
the
details
of
the
journey
completed
he
would
exactly
calculate
the
amount
of
money
that
must
be
spent
and
in
different
partitions
of
the
two
purses
that
he
carried
arrange
the
various
sums
that
would
be
necessary
for
cabs
porters
newspapers
refreshments
and
the
other
expenses
of
a
journey
it
was
wonderful
how
much
trouble
he
saved
himself
by
thus
making
ready
beforehand
lewis
carroll
was
never
driven
half
frantic
on
a
station
platform
because
he
had
to
change
a
sovereign
to
buy
a
penny
paper
while
the
train
was
on
the
verge
of
starting
with
him
journeys
were
always
comfortable
of
the
joys
that
waited
on
a
little
girl
who
stayed
with
lewis
carroll
at
his
oxford
home
i
can
give
no
better
idea
than
that
furnished
by
the
diary
that
follows
which
he
wrote
for
me
bit
by
bit
during
the
evenings
of
one
of
my
stays
at
oxford
illustrations
facsimile
visit
to
on
wednesday
the
eleventh
of
july
isa
happened
to
meet
a
friend
at
paddington
station
at
she
ca
remember
his
name
but
she
says
he
was
an
old
old
old
gentleman
and
he
had
invited
her
she
thinks
to
go
with
him
somewhere
or
other
she
ca
remember
where
the
first
thing
they
did
after
calling
at
a
shop
was
to
go
to
the
panorama
of
the
falls
of
niagara
isa
thought
it
very
wonderful
you
seemed
to
be
on
the
top
of
a
tower
with
miles
and
miles
of
country
all
round
you
the
things
in
front
were
real
and
somehow
they
joined
into
the
picture
behind
so
that
you
could
tell
where
the
real
things
ended
and
the
picture
began
near
the
foot
of
the
falls
there
was
a
crossing
the
river
which
showed
what
a
tremendous
height
the
falls
must
be
it
looked
so
tiny
in
the
road
in
front
were
two
men
and
a
dog
standing
looking
the
other
way
they
may
have
been
wooden
figures
or
part
of
the
picture
there
was
no
knowing
which
the
man
who
stood
next
to
isa
said
to
another
man
that
dog
looked
round
just
now
now
see
whistle
to
him
and
make
him
look
round
again
and
he
began
whistling
and
isa
almost
expected
it
looked
so
exactly
like
a
real
dog
that
it
would
turn
its
head
to
see
who
was
calling
it
after
that
isa
and
her
friend
the
aged
aged
man
went
to
the
house
of
a
mr
dymes
mrs
dymes
gave
them
some
dinner
and
two
of
her
children
called
helen
and
maud
went
with
them
to
terry
theatre
to
see
the
play
of
little
lord
fauntleroy
little
véra
beringer
was
the
little
lord
fauntleroy
isa
would
have
liked
to
play
the
part
but
the
manager
at
the
theatre
did
not
allow
her
as
she
did
not
know
the
words
which
would
have
made
it
go
off
badly
isa
liked
the
whole
play
very
much
the
passionate
old
earl
and
the
gentle
mother
of
the
little
boy
and
the
droll
hobbs
and
all
of
them
then
they
all
went
off
by
the
metropolitan
railway
and
the
two
miss
dymeses
got
out
at
their
station
and
isa
and
the
went
on
to
oxford
a
kind
old
lady
called
mrs
symonds
had
invited
isa
to
come
and
sleep
at
her
house
and
she
was
soon
fast
asleep
and
dreaming
that
she
and
little
lord
fauntleroy
were
going
in
a
steamer
down
the
falls
of
niagara
and
whistling
to
a
dog
who
was
in
such
a
hurry
to
go
up
the
falls
that
he
would
attend
to
them
the
next
morning
isa
set
off
almost
before
she
was
awake
with
the
to
pay
a
visit
to
a
little
college
called
christ
church
you
go
in
under
a
magnificent
tower
called
tom
tower
nearly
four
feet
high
so
that
isa
had
hardly
to
stoop
at
all
to
go
under
it
into
the
great
quadrangle
which
very
vulgar
people
call
tom
quad
you
should
always
be
polite
even
when
speaking
to
a
quadrangle
it
might
seem
not
to
take
any
notice
but
it
does
like
being
called
names
on
their
way
to
christ
church
they
saw
a
tall
monument
like
the
spire
of
a
church
called
the
martyrs
memorial
put
up
in
memory
of
three
bishops
cranmer
ridley
and
latimer
who
were
burned
in
the
reign
of
queen
mary
because
they
would
not
be
roman
catholics
christ
church
was
built
in
they
had
breakfast
at
ch
in
the
rooms
of
the
and
then
isa
learned
how
to
print
with
the
typewriter
and
printed
several
beautiful
volumes
of
poetry
all
of
her
own
invention
by
this
time
it
was
so
isa
paid
a
visit
to
the
kitchen
to
make
sure
that
the
chicken
for
her
dinner
was
being
properly
roasted
the
kitchen
is
about
the
oldest
part
of
the
college
so
was
built
about
it
has
a
large
enough
to
roast
forty
legs
of
mutton
at
once
then
they
saw
the
dining
hall
in
which
the
has
dined
several
times
about
times
perhaps
after
dinner
they
went
through
the
quadrangle
of
the
bodleian
library
into
broad
street
and
as
a
band
was
just
going
by
of
course
they
followed
it
isa
likes
bands
better
than
anything
in
the
world
except
lands
and
walking
on
sands
and
wringing
her
hands
the
band
led
them
into
the
gardens
of
wadham
college
built
in
where
there
was
a
going
on
the
treat
was
first
marching
twice
round
the
garden
then
having
a
photograph
done
of
them
all
in
a
row
then
a
of
punch
and
judy
which
would
be
ready
for
minutes
so
isa
and
would
wait
but
went
back
to
ch
and
saw
the
broad
walk
in
the
evening
they
played
at
reversi
till
isa
had
lost
the
small
remainder
of
her
temper
then
she
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
she
was
judy
and
was
beating
punch
with
a
stick
of
on
friday
morning
after
taking
her
medicine
very
amiably
went
with
the
who
go
with
her
though
she
told
him
over
and
over
she
would
rather
be
alone
to
the
gardens
of
worcester
college
built
in
where
they
did
see
the
swans
who
ought
to
have
been
on
the
lake
nor
the
hippopotamus
who
ought
not
to
have
been
walking
about
among
the
flowers
gathering
honey
like
a
busy
bee
after
breakfast
isa
helped
the
to
pack
his
luggage
because
he
thought
he
would
go
away
he
did
know
where
some
day
he
did
know
when
so
she
put
a
lot
of
things
she
did
know
what
into
boxes
she
did
know
which
after
dinner
they
went
to
john
college
built
in
and
admired
the
large
lawn
where
more
than
ladies
dressed
in
robes
of
gold
and
silver
were
not
walking
about
then
they
saw
the
chapel
of
keble
college
built
in
and
then
the
new
museum
where
isa
quite
lost
her
heart
to
a
charming
stuffed
gorilla
that
smiled
on
her
from
a
glass
case
the
museum
was
finished
in
the
most
curious
thing
they
saw
there
was
a
walking
leaf
a
kind
of
insect
that
looks
exactly
like
a
withered
leaf
then
they
went
to
new
college
built
in
saw
close
to
the
entrance
a
skew
arch
going
slantwise
through
the
wall
one
of
the
first
ever
built
in
england
after
seeing
the
gardens
they
returned
to
ch
ch
parts
of
the
old
city
walls
run
round
the
gardens
of
new
college
and
you
may
still
see
some
of
the
old
narrow
slits
through
which
the
defenders
could
shoot
arrows
at
the
attacking
army
who
could
hardly
succeed
in
shooting
through
them
from
the
outside
they
had
tea
with
mrs
paget
wife
of
paget
one
of
the
canons
of
ch
ch
then
after
a
sorrowful
evening
isa
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
she
was
buzzing
about
among
the
flowers
with
the
dear
gorilla
but
there
any
honey
in
them
only
slices
of
and
on
saturday
isa
had
a
music
lesson
and
learned
to
play
on
an
american
orguinette
it
is
not
a
difficult
instrument
to
play
as
you
only
have
to
turn
a
handle
round
and
round
so
she
did
it
nicely
you
put
a
long
piece
of
paper
in
and
it
goes
through
the
machine
and
the
holes
in
the
paper
make
different
notes
play
they
put
one
in
wrong
end
first
and
had
a
tune
backwards
and
soon
found
themselves
in
the
day
before
yesterday
so
they
dared
not
go
on
for
fear
of
making
isa
so
young
she
would
not
be
able
to
talk
the
does
not
like
visitors
who
only
howl
and
get
red
in
the
face
from
morning
to
night
in
the
afternoon
they
went
round
ch
ch
meadow
and
saw
the
barges
belonging
to
the
colleges
and
some
pretty
views
of
magdalen
tower
through
the
trees
then
they
went
through
the
botanical
gardens
built
in
the
year
no
by
the
bye
they
never
were
built
at
all
and
then
to
magdalen
college
at
the
top
of
the
wall
in
one
corner
they
saw
a
very
large
jolly
face
carved
in
stone
with
a
broad
grin
and
a
little
man
at
the
side
helping
him
to
laugh
by
pulling
up
the
corner
of
his
mouth
for
him
isa
thought
that
the
next
time
she
wants
to
laugh
she
will
get
nellie
and
maggie
to
help
her
with
two
people
to
pull
up
the
corners
of
your
mouth
for
you
it
is
as
easy
to
laugh
as
can
be
they
went
into
magdalen
meadow
which
has
a
pretty
walk
all
round
it
arched
over
with
trees
and
there
they
met
a
lady
from
amurrica
as
she
told
them
who
wanted
to
know
the
way
to
addison
walk
and
particularly
wanted
to
know
if
there
would
be
any
danger
in
going
there
they
told
her
the
way
and
that
of
the
lions
and
tigers
and
buffaloes
round
the
meadow
were
quite
gentle
and
hardly
ever
killed
people
so
she
set
off
pale
and
trembling
and
they
saw
her
no
more
only
they
heard
her
screams
in
the
distance
so
they
guessed
what
had
happened
to
her
then
they
rode
in
a
to
another
part
of
oxford
and
called
on
a
lady
called
mrs
jeane
and
her
little
called
noël
because
she
was
born
on
noël
is
the
french
name
for
christmas
and
there
they
had
so
much
tea
that
at
last
isa
nearly
turned
into
a
teaser
then
they
went
home
down
a
little
narrow
street
where
there
was
a
little
dog
standing
fixed
in
the
middle
of
the
street
as
if
its
feet
were
glued
to
the
ground
they
asked
it
how
long
it
meant
to
stand
there
and
it
said
as
well
as
it
could
till
the
week
after
next
then
isa
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
she
was
going
round
magdalen
meadow
with
the
amurrican
lady
and
there
was
a
buffalo
sitting
at
the
top
of
every
tree
handing
her
cups
of
tea
as
she
went
underneath
but
they
all
held
the
cups
so
that
the
tea
poured
all
over
her
head
and
ran
down
her
face
on
sunday
morning
they
went
to
mary
church
in
high
street
in
coming
home
down
the
street
next
to
the
one
where
they
had
found
a
fixed
dog
they
found
a
fixed
cat
a
poor
little
kitten
that
had
put
out
its
head
through
the
bars
of
the
and
get
back
again
they
rang
the
bell
at
the
next
door
but
the
maid
said
the
cellar
was
in
that
house
and
before
they
could
get
to
the
right
door
the
cat
had
unfixed
its
head
either
from
its
neck
or
from
the
bars
and
had
gone
inside
isa
thought
the
animals
in
this
city
have
a
curious
way
of
fixing
themselves
up
and
down
the
place
as
if
they
were
then
they
went
back
to
ch
and
looked
at
a
lot
of
dresses
which
the
kept
in
a
cupboard
to
dress
up
children
in
when
they
come
to
be
photographed
some
of
the
dresses
had
been
used
in
pantomimes
at
drury
lane
some
were
rags
to
dress
up
in
some
had
been
very
magnificent
once
but
were
getting
quite
old
and
shabby
talking
of
old
dresses
there
is
one
college
in
oxford
so
old
that
it
is
not
known
for
certain
when
it
was
built
the
people
who
live
there
say
it
was
built
more
than
years
ago
and
when
they
say
this
the
people
who
live
in
the
other
colleges
never
contradict
them
but
listen
most
respectfully
only
they
wink
a
little
with
one
eye
as
if
they
believe
it
the
same
day
isa
saw
a
curious
book
of
pictures
of
ghosts
if
you
look
hard
at
one
for
a
minute
and
then
look
at
the
ceiling
you
see
another
ghost
there
only
when
you
have
a
black
one
in
the
book
it
is
a
one
on
the
ceiling
when
it
is
green
in
the
book
it
is
on
the
ceiling
in
the
middle
of
the
day
as
usual
isa
had
her
dinner
but
this
time
it
was
grander
than
usual
there
was
a
dish
of
meringues
this
is
pronounced
marangs
which
isa
thought
so
good
that
she
would
have
liked
to
live
on
them
all
the
rest
of
her
life
they
took
a
little
walk
in
the
afternoon
and
in
the
middle
of
broad
street
they
saw
a
cross
buried
in
the
ground
very
near
the
place
where
the
martyrs
were
burned
then
they
went
into
the
gardens
of
trinity
college
built
in
to
see
the
lime
walk
a
pretty
little
avenue
of
the
great
iron
gates
at
the
end
of
the
garden
are
not
real
gates
but
all
done
in
one
piece
and
they
could
open
them
even
if
you
knocked
all
day
isa
thought
them
a
miserable
sham
then
they
went
into
the
parks
this
word
does
mean
parks
of
grass
with
trees
and
deer
but
parks
of
guns
that
is
great
rows
of
cannons
which
stood
there
when
king
charles
the
first
was
in
oxford
and
oliver
cromwell
fighting
against
him
they
saw
mansfield
college
a
new
college
just
begun
to
be
built
with
such
tremendously
narrow
windows
that
isa
was
afraid
the
young
gentlemen
who
come
there
will
not
be
able
to
see
to
learn
their
lessons
and
will
go
away
from
oxford
just
as
wise
as
they
came
then
they
went
to
the
evening
service
at
new
college
and
heard
some
beautiful
singing
and
then
back
to
ch
in
pouring
rain
isa
tried
to
count
the
drops
but
when
she
had
counted
four
millions
three
hundred
and
thousand
two
hundred
and
she
got
tired
of
counting
and
left
off
after
dinner
isa
got
somebody
or
other
she
is
not
sure
who
it
was
to
finish
this
story
for
her
then
she
went
to
bed
and
dreamed
she
was
fixed
in
the
middle
of
oxford
with
her
feet
fast
to
the
ground
and
her
head
between
the
bars
of
a
in
a
sort
of
final
tableau
then
she
dreamed
the
curtain
came
down
and
the
people
all
called
out
encore
but
she
cried
out
oh
not
again
it
would
be
dreadful
to
have
my
visit
all
over
again
but
on
second
thoughts
she
smiled
in
her
sleep
and
said
well
do
you
know
after
all
i
think
i
would
mind
so
very
much
if
i
have
it
all
over
again
lewis
carroll
the
end
this
diary
and
what
i
have
written
before
show
how
i
as
a
little
girl
knew
lewis
carroll
at
oxford
for
his
little
girl
friends
of
course
he
reserved
the
most
intimate
side
of
his
nature
but
on
occasion
he
would
throw
off
his
reserve
and
talk
earnestly
and
well
to
some
young
man
in
whose
life
he
took
an
interest
arthur
girdlestone
is
able
to
bear
witness
to
this
and
he
has
given
me
an
account
of
an
evening
that
he
once
spent
with
lewis
carroll
which
i
reproduce
here
from
notes
made
during
our
conversation
girdlestone
then
an
undergraduate
at
new
college
had
on
one
occasion
to
call
on
lewis
carroll
at
his
rooms
in
tom
quad
at
the
time
of
which
i
am
speaking
lewis
carroll
had
retired
very
much
from
the
society
which
he
had
affected
a
few
years
before
indeed
for
the
last
years
of
his
life
he
was
almost
a
recluse
and
beyond
dining
in
hall
saw
hardly
any
one
miss
beatrice
hatch
one
of
his
girl
friends
writes
apropos
of
his
seclusion
if
you
were
very
anxious
to
get
him
to
come
to
your
house
on
any
particular
day
the
only
chance
was
to
him
but
only
to
inform
him
that
you
would
be
at
home
otherwise
he
would
say
you
have
me
i
can
not
come
for
i
have
made
a
rule
to
decline
all
but
i
will
come
the
next
day
in
former
years
he
would
sometimes
consent
to
go
to
a
if
he
was
quite
sure
he
was
not
to
be
off
or
introduced
to
any
one
as
the
author
of
i
must
again
quote
from
a
note
of
his
in
answer
to
an
invitation
to
tea
an
awful
proposition
to
drink
tea
from
four
to
six
would
tax
the
constitution
even
of
a
hardened
tea
drinker
for
me
who
hardly
ever
touch
it
it
would
probably
be
fatal
all
through
the
university
except
in
an
extremely
limited
circle
lewis
carroll
was
regarded
as
a
person
who
lived
very
much
by
himself
when
girdlestone
said
to
me
i
went
to
see
him
on
quite
a
slight
acquaintance
i
confess
it
was
with
some
slight
feeling
of
trepidation
however
i
had
to
on
some
business
and
accordingly
i
knocked
at
his
door
about
one
winter
evening
and
was
invited
to
come
in
he
was
sitting
working
at
a
and
all
round
him
were
piles
of
mss
arranged
with
mathematical
neatness
and
many
of
them
tied
up
with
tape
the
lamp
threw
his
face
into
sharp
relief
as
he
greeted
me
my
business
was
soon
over
and
i
was
about
to
go
away
when
he
asked
me
if
i
would
have
a
glass
of
wine
and
sit
with
him
for
a
little
the
night
outside
was
very
cold
and
the
fire
was
bright
and
inviting
and
i
sat
down
he
began
to
talk
to
me
of
ordinary
subjects
of
the
things
a
man
might
do
at
oxford
of
the
place
itself
and
the
affection
in
which
he
held
it
he
talked
quietly
and
in
a
rather
tired
voice
during
our
conversation
my
eye
fell
upon
a
photograph
of
a
little
girl
evidently
from
the
freshness
of
its
appearance
but
newly
taken
which
was
resting
upon
the
ledge
of
a
at
my
elbow
it
was
the
picture
of
a
tiny
child
very
pretty
and
i
picked
it
up
to
look
at
it
is
the
baby
of
a
girl
friend
of
mine
he
said
and
then
with
an
absolute
change
of
voice
is
something
very
strange
about
very
young
children
something
i
can
not
understand
i
asked
him
in
what
way
and
he
explained
at
some
length
he
was
far
less
at
his
ease
than
when
talking
trivialities
and
he
occasionally
stammered
and
sometimes
hesitated
for
a
word
i
can
not
remember
all
he
said
but
some
of
his
remarks
still
remain
with
me
he
said
that
in
the
company
of
very
little
children
his
brain
enjoyed
a
rest
which
was
startlingly
recuperative
if
he
had
been
working
too
hard
or
had
tired
his
brain
in
any
way
to
play
with
children
was
like
an
actual
material
tonic
to
his
whole
system
i
understood
him
to
say
that
the
effect
was
almost
physical
he
said
that
he
found
it
much
easier
to
understand
children
to
get
his
mind
into
correspondence
with
their
minds
when
he
was
fatigued
with
other
work
personally
i
did
not
understand
little
children
and
they
seemed
quite
outside
my
experience
and
rather
incautiously
i
asked
him
if
children
never
bored
him
he
had
been
standing
up
for
most
of
the
time
and
when
i
asked
him
that
he
sat
down
suddenly
are
of
my
life
he
said
can
not
understand
how
any
one
could
be
bored
by
little
children
i
think
when
you
are
older
you
will
come
to
see
this
i
hope
you
come
to
see
it
after
that
he
changed
the
subject
once
more
and
became
again
the
mathematician
a
little
formal
and
rather
weary
girdlestone
probably
had
a
unique
experience
for
it
was
but
rarely
that
dodgson
so
far
unburdened
himself
to
a
comparative
stranger
and
what
was
even
worse
to
a
stranger
now
i
have
given
you
two
different
phases
of
lewis
carroll
at
oxford
lewis
carroll
as
the
little
girl
companion
and
lewis
carroll
sitting
by
the
fireside
telling
something
of
his
inner
self
to
a
young
man
i
am
going
on
to
talk
about
my
life
with
him
at
eastbourne
where
i
used
year
by
year
to
stay
with
him
at
his
house
in
lushington
road
he
was
very
fond
of
eastbourne
and
it
was
from
that
place
that
i
received
the
most
charming
letters
that
he
wrote
me
here
is
one
and
i
could
hardly
say
how
many
times
i
have
taken
this
delightful
letter
from
its
drawer
to
read
through
and
through
again
lushington
road
eastbourne
oh
you
naughty
naughty
little
culprit
if
only
i
could
fly
to
fulham
with
a
handy
little
stick
ten
feet
long
and
four
inches
thick
is
my
favourite
size
how
i
would
rap
your
wicked
little
knuckles
however
there
is
much
harm
done
so
i
will
sentence
you
to
a
very
mild
punishment
only
one
year
imprisonment
if
you
just
tell
the
fulham
policeman
about
it
he
manage
all
the
rest
for
you
and
he
fit
you
with
a
nice
pair
of
handcuffs
and
lock
you
up
in
a
nice
cosy
dark
cell
and
feed
you
on
nice
dry
bread
and
delicious
cold
water
illustration
george
the
dragon
but
how
badly
you
spell
your
words
i
so
puzzled
about
the
full
of
love
and
baskets
full
of
kisses
but
at
last
i
made
out
why
of
course
you
meant
sack
full
of
and
a
basket
full
of
then
i
understood
what
you
were
sending
me
and
just
then
dyer
came
to
tell
me
a
large
sack
and
a
basket
had
come
there
was
such
a
miawing
in
the
house
as
if
all
the
cats
in
eastbourne
had
come
to
see
me
just
open
them
please
dyer
and
count
the
things
in
them
so
in
a
few
minutes
dyer
came
and
said
pairs
of
gloves
in
the
sack
and
kittens
in
the
basket
me
that
makes
gloves
four
times
as
many
gloves
as
kittens
it
very
kind
of
maggie
but
why
did
she
send
so
many
gloves
for
i
have
got
you
know
mrs
dyer
and
dyer
said
indeed
you
hands
short
of
that
however
the
next
day
i
made
out
what
to
do
and
i
took
the
basket
with
me
and
walked
off
to
the
parish
school
the
school
you
know
and
i
said
to
the
mistress
many
little
girls
are
there
at
school
sir
have
they
all
been
good
all
day
good
as
gold
sir
so
i
waited
outside
the
door
with
my
basket
and
as
each
little
girl
came
out
i
just
popped
a
soft
little
kitten
into
her
hands
oh
what
joy
there
was
the
little
girls
went
all
dancing
home
nursing
their
kittens
and
the
whole
air
was
full
of
purring
then
the
next
morning
i
went
to
the
school
before
it
opened
to
ask
the
little
girls
how
the
kittens
had
behaved
in
the
night
and
they
all
arrived
sobbing
and
crying
and
their
faces
and
hands
were
all
covered
with
scratches
and
they
had
the
kittens
wrapped
up
in
their
pinafores
to
keep
them
from
scratching
any
more
and
they
sobbed
out
kittens
have
been
scratching
us
all
night
all
the
night
so
then
i
said
to
myself
a
nice
little
girl
maggie
is
i
see
why
she
sent
all
those
gloves
and
why
there
are
four
times
as
many
gloves
as
kittens
and
i
said
loud
to
the
little
girls
mind
my
dear
children
do
your
lessons
nicely
and
do
cry
any
more
and
when
school
is
over
you
find
me
at
the
door
and
you
shall
see
what
you
shall
see
so
in
the
evening
when
the
little
girls
came
running
out
with
the
kittens
still
wrapped
up
in
their
pinafores
there
was
i
at
the
door
with
a
big
sack
and
as
each
little
girl
came
out
i
just
popped
into
her
hand
two
pairs
of
gloves
and
each
little
girl
unrolled
her
pinafore
and
took
out
an
angry
little
kitten
spitting
and
snarling
with
its
claws
sticking
out
like
a
hedgehog
but
it
had
time
to
scratch
for
in
one
moment
it
found
all
its
four
claws
popped
into
nice
soft
warm
gloves
and
then
the
kittens
got
quite
and
gentle
and
began
purring
again
so
the
little
girls
went
dancing
home
again
and
the
next
morning
they
came
dancing
back
to
school
the
scratches
were
all
healed
and
they
told
me
kittens
been
good
and
when
any
kitten
wants
to
catch
a
mouse
it
just
takes
off
of
its
gloves
and
if
it
wants
to
catch
mice
it
takes
off
two
gloves
and
if
it
wants
to
catch
mice
it
takes
off
gloves
and
if
it
wants
to
catch
mice
it
takes
off
all
its
gloves
but
the
moment
caught
the
mice
they
pop
their
gloves
on
again
because
they
know
we
ca
love
them
without
their
gloves
for
you
see
have
got
them
there
none
so
all
the
little
girls
said
thank
maggie
and
we
send
her
and
in
return
for
her
kittens
and
her
and
i
told
them
in
the
wrong
order
and
they
said
they
had
your
loving
old
uncle
love
and
kisses
to
nellie
and
emsie
this
letter
takes
up
eight
pages
of
close
writing
and
i
should
very
much
doubt
if
any
child
ever
had
a
more
charming
one
from
anybody
the
whimsical
fancy
in
it
the
absolute
comprehension
of
a
child
intellect
the
quickness
with
which
the
writer
employs
the
slightest
incident
or
thing
that
would
be
likely
to
please
a
little
girl
is
simply
wonderful
i
shall
never
forget
how
the
letter
charmed
and
delighted
my
sister
maggie
and
myself
we
called
it
the
glove
and
kitten
letter
and
as
i
look
at
the
tremulous
handwriting
which
is
lying
by
my
side
it
all
comes
back
to
me
very
vividly
like
the
sound
of
forgotten
fingers
on
the
latch
to
some
lonely
fireside
watcher
when
the
wind
is
wailing
round
the
house
with
a
wilder
inner
note
than
it
has
in
the
daytime
at
eastbourne
i
was
happier
even
with
lewis
carroll
than
i
was
at
oxford
we
seemed
more
free
and
there
was
the
air
of
holiday
over
it
all
every
day
of
my
stay
at
the
house
in
lushington
road
was
a
perfect
dream
of
delight
there
was
one
regular
and
fixed
routine
which
hardly
ever
varied
and
which
i
came
to
know
by
heart
and
i
will
write
an
account
of
it
here
and
ask
any
little
girl
who
reads
it
if
she
ever
had
such
a
splendid
time
in
her
life
to
begin
with
we
used
to
get
up
very
early
indeed
our
bedroom
doors
faced
each
other
at
the
top
of
the
staircase
when
i
came
out
of
mine
i
always
knew
if
i
might
go
into
his
room
or
not
by
his
signal
if
when
i
came
into
the
passage
i
found
that
a
newspaper
had
been
put
under
the
door
then
i
knew
i
might
go
in
at
once
but
if
there
was
no
newspaper
then
i
had
to
wait
till
it
appeared
i
used
to
sit
down
on
the
top
stair
as
quiet
as
a
mouse
watching
for
the
paper
to
come
under
the
door
when
i
would
rush
in
almost
before
uncle
had
time
to
get
out
of
the
way
this
was
always
the
first
pleasure
and
excitement
of
the
day
then
we
used
to
downstairs
to
breakfast
after
which
we
always
read
a
chapter
out
of
the
bible
so
that
i
should
remember
it
i
always
had
to
tell
it
to
him
afterwards
as
a
story
of
my
own
illustration
lewis
carroll
house
at
eastbourne
now
then
isa
dearest
he
would
say
tell
me
a
story
and
mind
you
begin
with
upon
a
time
a
story
which
does
not
begin
with
upon
a
time
ca
possibly
be
a
good
story
it
important
when
i
had
told
my
story
it
was
time
to
go
out
i
was
learning
swimming
at
the
devonshire
park
baths
and
we
always
had
a
bargain
together
he
would
never
allow
me
to
go
to
the
which
i
revelled
in
until
i
had
promised
him
faithfully
that
i
would
go
afterwards
to
the
dentist
he
had
great
ideas
upon
the
importance
of
a
regular
and
almost
daily
visit
to
the
dentist
he
himself
went
to
a
dentist
as
he
would
have
gone
to
a
hairdresser
and
he
insisted
that
all
the
little
girls
he
knew
should
go
too
the
precaution
sounds
strange
and
one
might
be
inclined
to
think
that
lewis
carroll
carried
it
to
an
unnecessary
length
but
i
can
only
bear
personal
witness
to
the
fact
that
i
have
firm
strong
teeth
and
have
never
had
a
toothache
in
my
life
i
believe
i
owe
this
entirely
to
those
daily
visits
to
the
eastbourne
dentist
soon
after
this
it
was
time
for
lunch
and
we
both
went
back
to
the
rooms
in
lushington
road
lewis
carroll
never
had
a
proper
lunch
a
fact
which
always
used
to
puzzle
me
tremendously
i
could
not
understand
how
a
big
man
could
live
on
a
glass
of
sherry
and
a
biscuit
at
dinner
time
it
seemed
such
a
pity
when
there
was
lots
of
mutton
and
that
he
should
not
have
any
i
always
used
to
ask
him
are
you
hungry
uncle
even
after
lunch
i
used
to
have
a
lesson
in
backgammon
a
game
of
which
he
was
passionately
fond
and
of
which
he
could
never
have
enough
then
came
what
to
me
was
the
great
trial
of
the
day
i
am
afraid
i
was
a
very
lazy
little
girl
in
those
days
and
i
know
i
hated
walking
far
the
trial
was
that
we
should
walk
to
the
top
of
beachy
head
every
afternoon
i
used
to
like
it
very
much
when
i
got
there
but
the
walk
was
irksome
lewis
carroll
believed
very
much
in
a
great
amount
of
exercise
and
said
one
should
always
go
to
bed
physically
wearied
with
the
exercise
of
the
day
accordingly
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
and
every
afternoon
i
had
to
walk
to
the
top
of
beachy
head
he
was
very
good
and
kind
he
would
invent
all
sorts
of
new
games
to
beguile
the
tedium
of
the
way
one
very
curious
and
strange
trait
in
his
character
was
shown
on
these
walks
i
used
to
be
very
fond
of
flowers
and
of
animals
also
a
pretty
dog
or
a
hedge
of
honeysuckle
were
always
pleasant
events
upon
a
walk
to
me
and
yet
he
himself
cared
for
neither
flowers
nor
animals
tender
and
kind
as
he
was
simple
and
unassuming
in
all
his
tastes
yet
he
did
not
like
flowers
i
confess
that
even
now
i
find
it
hard
to
understand
he
knew
children
so
thoroughly
and
well
perhaps
better
than
any
one
else
that
it
is
all
the
stranger
that
he
did
not
care
for
things
that
generally
attract
them
so
much
however
be
that
as
it
may
the
fact
remained
when
i
was
in
raptures
over
a
poppy
or
a
dogrose
he
would
try
hard
to
be
as
interested
as
i
was
but
even
to
my
childish
eyes
it
was
an
obvious
effort
and
he
would
always
rather
invent
some
new
game
for
us
to
play
at
once
and
once
only
i
remember
him
to
have
taken
an
interest
in
a
flower
and
that
was
because
of
the
that
was
attached
to
it
and
not
because
of
the
beauty
of
the
flower
itself
we
used
to
walk
into
the
country
that
stretched
in
beautiful
natural
avenues
of
trees
inland
from
eastbourne
one
day
while
we
sat
under
a
great
tree
and
the
hum
of
the
myriad
insect
life
rivalled
the
murmur
of
the
waves
he
took
a
foxglove
from
the
heap
that
lay
in
my
lap
and
told
me
the
story
of
how
they
came
by
their
name
how
in
the
old
days
when
all
over
england
there
were
great
forests
like
the
forest
of
arden
that
shakespeare
loved
the
pixies
the
little
folks
used
to
wander
at
night
in
the
glades
like
titania
and
oberon
and
puck
and
because
they
took
great
pride
in
their
dainty
hands
they
made
themselves
gloves
out
of
the
flowers
so
the
particular
flower
that
the
little
folks
used
came
to
be
called
folks
gloves
then
because
the
country
people
were
rough
and
clumsy
in
their
talk
the
name
was
shortened
into
the
name
that
every
one
uses
now
when
i
got
very
tired
we
used
to
sit
down
upon
the
grass
and
he
used
to
show
me
the
most
wonderful
things
made
out
of
his
handkerchief
every
one
when
a
child
has
i
suppose
seen
the
trick
in
which
a
handkerchief
is
rolled
up
to
look
like
a
mouse
and
then
made
to
jump
about
by
a
movement
of
the
hand
he
did
this
better
than
any
one
i
ever
saw
and
the
trick
was
a
joy
by
a
sort
of
consent
between
us
the
handkerchief
trick
was
kept
especially
for
the
walk
to
beachy
head
when
about
i
was
a
little
tired
and
wanted
to
rest
when
we
actually
got
to
the
head
there
was
tea
waiting
in
the
coastguard
cottage
he
always
said
i
ate
far
too
much
and
he
would
never
allow
me
more
than
one
rock
cake
and
a
cup
of
tea
this
was
an
invariable
rule
and
much
as
i
wished
for
it
i
was
never
allowed
to
have
more
than
one
rock
cake
it
was
in
the
coastguard
house
or
on
the
grass
outside
that
i
heard
most
of
his
stories
sometimes
he
would
make
excursions
into
the
realms
of
pure
romance
where
there
were
scaly
dragons
and
strange
beasts
that
sat
up
and
talked
in
all
these
stories
there
was
always
an
adventure
in
a
forest
and
the
great
scene
of
each
tale
always
took
place
in
a
wood
the
consummation
of
a
story
was
always
heralded
by
the
phrase
the
children
now
came
to
a
deep
dark
wood
when
i
heard
that
sentence
which
was
always
spoken
very
slowly
and
with
a
solemn
dropping
of
the
voice
i
always
knew
that
the
really
exciting
part
was
coming
i
used
to
nestle
a
little
nearer
to
him
and
he
used
to
hold
me
a
little
closer
as
he
told
of
the
final
adventure
he
did
not
always
tell
me
fairy
tales
though
i
think
i
liked
the
fairy
tale
much
the
best
sometimes
he
gave
me
accounts
of
adventures
which
had
happened
to
him
there
was
one
particularly
thrilling
story
of
how
he
was
lost
on
beachy
head
in
a
sea
fog
and
had
to
find
his
way
home
by
means
of
boulders
this
was
the
more
interesting
because
we
were
on
the
actual
scene
of
the
disaster
and
to
be
there
stimulated
the
imagination
the
summer
afternoons
on
the
great
headland
were
very
sweet
and
peaceful
i
have
never
met
a
man
so
sensible
to
the
influences
of
nature
as
lewis
carroll
when
the
sunset
was
very
beautiful
he
was
often
affected
by
the
sight
the
widespread
wrinkled
sea
below
in
the
mellow
melancholy
light
of
the
afternoon
seemed
to
fit
in
with
his
temperament
i
have
still
a
mental
picture
that
i
can
recall
of
him
on
the
cliff
just
as
the
sun
was
setting
and
a
cool
breeze
whispered
round
us
he
would
take
off
his
hat
and
let
the
wind
play
with
his
hair
and
he
would
look
out
to
sea
once
i
saw
tears
in
his
eyes
and
when
we
turned
to
go
he
gripped
my
hand
much
tighter
than
usual
illustration
miss
isa
bowman
and
miss
bessie
hatton
as
the
little
princes
in
the
tower
we
generally
got
back
to
dinner
about
seven
or
earlier
he
would
never
let
me
change
my
frock
for
the
meal
even
if
we
were
going
to
a
concert
or
theatre
afterwards
he
had
a
curious
theory
that
a
child
should
not
change
her
clothes
twice
in
one
day
he
himself
made
no
alteration
in
his
dress
at
dinner
time
nor
would
he
permit
me
to
do
so
yet
he
was
not
by
any
means
an
untidy
or
slovenly
man
he
had
many
little
fads
in
dress
but
his
great
horror
and
abomination
was
shoes
with
pointed
toes
no
words
were
strong
enough
he
thought
to
describe
such
monstrous
things
lewis
carroll
was
a
deeply
religious
man
and
on
sundays
at
eastbourne
we
always
went
twice
to
church
yet
he
held
that
no
child
should
be
forced
into
against
its
will
such
a
state
of
mind
in
a
child
he
said
needed
most
careful
treatment
and
the
very
worst
thing
to
do
was
to
make
attendance
at
the
services
compulsory
another
habit
of
his
which
must
i
feel
sure
sound
rather
dreadful
to
many
was
that
should
the
sermon
prove
beyond
my
comprehension
he
would
give
me
a
little
book
to
read
it
was
better
far
he
maintained
to
read
than
to
stare
idly
about
the
church
when
the
rest
of
the
congregation
rose
at
the
entrance
of
the
choir
he
kept
his
seat
he
argued
that
rising
to
one
feet
at
such
a
time
tended
to
make
the
conceited
i
think
he
was
quite
right
he
kept
no
special
books
for
sunday
reading
for
he
was
most
emphatically
of
opinion
that
anything
tending
to
make
sunday
a
day
dreaded
by
a
child
should
be
studiously
avoided
he
did
not
like
me
to
sew
on
sunday
unless
it
was
absolutely
necessary
one
would
have
hardly
expected
that
a
man
of
so
reserved
a
nature
as
lewis
carroll
would
have
taken
much
interest
in
the
stage
yet
he
was
devoted
to
the
theatre
and
one
of
the
commonest
of
the
treats
that
he
gave
his
little
girl
friends
was
to
organise
a
party
for
the
play
as
a
critic
of
acting
he
was
naïve
and
outspoken
and
never
hesitated
to
find
fault
if
he
thought
it
justifiable
the
following
letter
that
he
wrote
to
me
criticising
my
acting
in
richard
iii
when
i
was
playing
with
richard
mansfield
is
one
of
the
most
interesting
that
i
ever
received
from
him
although
it
was
written
for
a
child
to
understand
and
profit
by
and
moreover
written
in
the
simplest
possible
way
it
yet
even
now
strikes
me
as
a
trenchant
and
valuable
piece
of
criticism
illustration
isa
bowman
as
duke
of
york
ch
ch
oxford
my
lord
duke
the
photographs
which
your
grace
did
me
the
honour
of
sending
arrived
safely
and
i
can
assure
your
royal
highness
that
i
am
very
glad
to
have
them
and
like
them
much
particularly
the
large
head
of
your
late
royal
uncle
little
little
son
i
do
not
wonder
that
your
excellent
uncle
richard
should
say
with
his
head
as
a
hint
to
the
photographer
to
print
it
off
would
your
highness
like
me
to
go
on
calling
you
the
duke
of
york
or
shall
i
say
own
own
darling
isa
which
do
you
like
best
now
i
going
to
find
fault
with
my
pet
about
her
acting
what
the
good
of
an
old
uncle
like
me
except
to
find
fault
you
do
the
meeting
with
the
prince
of
wales
nicely
and
lovingly
and
in
teasing
your
uncle
for
his
dagger
and
his
sword
you
are
very
sweet
and
playful
and
not
finding
fault
isa
says
to
herself
is
it
well
i
try
again
did
i
hear
you
say
weightier
things
you
say
a
nay
leaning
on
the
word
if
so
it
was
a
mistake
rule
for
knowing
which
word
to
lean
on
is
the
word
that
tells
you
something
something
that
is
from
what
you
expected
take
the
sentence
i
bought
a
bag
of
apples
then
i
bought
a
bag
of
pears
you
would
say
i
bought
a
of
pears
the
is
nothing
new
because
it
was
a
bag
in
the
first
part
of
the
sentence
but
the
are
new
and
different
from
the
so
you
would
say
i
bought
a
bag
of
do
you
understand
that
my
pet
now
what
you
say
to
richard
amounts
to
this
light
gifts
say
to
a
beggar
yes
with
heavy
gifts
you
say
to
a
beggar
nay
the
words
say
to
a
beggar
are
the
same
both
times
so
you
must
lean
on
any
of
words
but
is
different
from
and
is
different
from
so
the
way
to
say
the
sentence
would
be
gifts
you
say
to
a
beggar
with
gifts
you
say
to
a
beggar
and
the
way
to
say
the
lines
in
the
play
is
then
i
see
you
will
but
with
gifts
in
things
you
say
a
beggar
one
more
sentence
when
richard
says
would
you
have
my
little
lord
and
you
reply
that
i
might
thank
you
as
you
call
me
did
i
hear
you
pronounce
as
if
it
were
spelt
with
an
i
know
it
very
common
i
often
do
it
myself
to
say
you
as
an
exclamation
by
itself
i
suppose
it
an
odd
way
of
pronouncing
the
word
but
i
sure
it
wrong
to
pronounce
it
so
when
it
comes
into
a
it
will
sound
nicer
if
you
pronounce
it
so
as
to
rhyme
with
one
more
thing
an
impertinent
old
uncle
always
finding
fault
you
not
as
when
acting
the
duke
as
you
were
when
you
acted
alice
you
seemed
to
me
not
to
forgot
enough
it
was
not
so
much
a
real
talking
to
his
elder
brother
and
his
uncle
it
was
talking
to
people
she
did
care
about
for
an
audience
to
listen
to
i
do
mean
it
was
that
all
but
you
were
now
do
be
jealous
of
miss
hatton
when
i
say
she
was
natural
she
looked
and
spoke
like
a
prince
of
wales
and
she
seem
to
know
that
there
was
any
audience
if
you
are
ever
to
be
a
actress
as
i
hope
you
will
you
must
learn
to
altogether
and
the
character
you
are
playing
try
to
think
is
the
prince
of
wales
i
his
little
brother
and
glad
to
meet
him
and
i
love
him
much
and
is
my
uncle
he
very
kind
and
lets
me
say
saucy
things
to
him
and
forget
that
there
anybody
else
listening
my
sweet
pet
i
you
wo
be
offended
with
me
for
saying
what
i
fancy
might
make
your
acting
better
your
loving
old
uncle
charles
x
for
nellie
x
for
maggie
x
for
emsie
x
for
isa
he
was
a
fairly
constant
patron
of
all
the
london
theatres
save
the
gaiety
and
the
adelphi
which
he
did
not
like
and
numbered
a
good
many
theatrical
folk
among
his
acquaintances
miss
ellen
terry
was
one
of
his
greatest
friends
once
i
remember
we
made
an
expedition
from
eastbourne
to
margate
to
visit
miss
sarah
thorne
theatre
and
especially
for
the
purpose
of
seeing
miss
violet
vanbrugh
ophelia
he
was
a
great
admirer
of
both
miss
violet
and
miss
irene
vanbrugh
as
actresses
of
miss
school
of
acting
too
he
had
the
highest
opinion
and
it
was
his
often
expressed
wish
that
all
intending
players
could
have
so
excellent
a
course
of
tuition
among
the
male
members
of
the
theatrical
profession
he
had
no
especial
favourites
excepting
toole
and
richard
mansfield
he
never
went
to
a
but
considered
that
properly
managed
they
might
be
beneficial
to
the
public
it
was
only
when
the
refrain
of
some
particularly
vulgar
song
broke
upon
his
ears
in
the
streets
that
he
permitted
himself
to
speak
harshly
about
variety
theatres
comic
opera
when
it
was
wholesome
he
liked
and
was
a
frequent
visitor
to
the
savoy
theatre
the
good
old
style
of
pantomime
too
was
a
great
delight
to
him
and
he
would
often
speak
affectionately
of
the
pantomimes
at
brighton
during
the
régime
of
and
nye
chart
but
of
the
pantomime
he
had
a
horror
and
nothing
would
induce
him
to
visit
one
when
pantomimes
are
written
for
children
once
more
he
said
i
will
go
not
till
then
once
when
a
friend
told
him
that
she
was
about
to
take
her
little
girls
to
the
pantomime
he
did
not
rest
till
he
had
dissuaded
her
to
conclude
what
i
have
said
about
lewis
carroll
affection
for
the
dramatic
art
i
will
give
a
kind
of
examination
paper
written
for
a
child
who
had
been
learning
a
recitation
called
the
demon
of
the
pit
though
his
stuttering
prevented
him
from
being
himself
anything
of
a
reciter
he
loved
correct
elocution
and
would
take
any
pains
to
make
a
child
perfect
in
a
piece
illustration
the
little
princes
first
of
all
there
is
an
explanatory
paragraph
as
you
do
ask
any
questions
about
demon
of
the
pit
i
suppose
you
understand
it
all
so
please
answer
these
questions
just
as
you
would
do
if
a
younger
child
say
mollie
asked
them
please
ethel
will
you
explain
this
poem
to
me
there
are
some
very
hard
words
in
it
what
are
they
dear
well
in
the
first
line
if
you
chance
to
make
a
sally
what
does
sally
mean
dear
mollie
i
believe
sally
means
to
take
a
chance
work
then
near
the
end
of
the
first
verse
whereupon
call
her
cronies
what
does
whereupon
mean
and
what
are
cronies
i
think
whereupon
means
at
the
same
time
and
cronies
means
her
favourite
playfellows
and
invest
in
proud
polonies
what
to
invest
to
invest
means
to
spend
money
in
anything
you
fancy
and
what
a
woman
of
the
day
a
woman
of
the
day
means
a
wonder
of
the
time
with
the
general
public
pyrotechnic
blaze
of
wit
what
pyrotechnic
mollie
i
think
you
will
find
that
pyrotechnic
means
quick
with
flashes
of
lightning
then
the
lines
that
begin
the
astounding
infant
wonder
please
explain
rôle
and
mise
and
tout
ensemble
and
grit
well
mollie
rôle
means
so
many
different
things
but
in
the
demon
of
the
pit
i
should
think
it
meant
the
leading
part
of
the
piece
and
mise
means
something
extra
good
introduced
and
tout
means
to
seek
for
applause
but
ensemble
means
the
whole
of
the
parts
taken
together
and
grit
means
something
good
and
the
goblins
prostrate
tumble
what
prostrate
i
believe
prostrate
means
to
be
cast
down
and
unhappy
and
his
accents
shake
a
bit
what
are
accents
to
accent
is
to
lay
stress
upon
a
word
waits
resignedly
behind
what
resignedly
resignedly
means
giving
up
yielding
they
have
tripe
as
light
to
dream
on
what
does
as
mean
here
and
what
does
to
dream
on
mean
mollie
dear
your
last
question
is
very
funny
in
the
first
place
i
have
always
been
told
that
hot
suppers
are
not
good
for
any
one
and
i
should
think
that
tripe
would
be
to
dream
on
but
very
heavy
thank
you
ethel
i
have
now
nearly
finished
my
little
memoir
of
lewis
carroll
that
is
to
say
i
have
written
down
all
that
i
can
remember
of
my
personal
knowledge
of
him
but
i
think
it
is
from
the
letters
and
the
diaries
published
in
this
book
that
my
readers
must
chiefly
gain
an
insight
into
the
character
of
the
greatest
friend
to
children
who
ever
lived
not
only
did
he
study
children
ways
for
his
own
pleasure
but
he
studied
them
in
order
that
he
might
please
them
for
instance
here
is
a
letter
that
he
wrote
to
my
little
sister
nelly
eight
years
ago
which
begins
on
the
last
page
and
is
written
entirely
backwards
a
kind
of
variant
on
his
famous
writing
you
have
to
begin
at
the
last
word
and
read
backwards
before
you
can
understand
it
the
only
ordinary
thing
about
it
is
the
date
it
begins
i
mean
if
one
was
to
read
it
in
the
ordinary
way
with
the
characteristic
monogram
uncle
loving
your
instead
grandson
his
to
it
give
to
had
you
that
so
years
or
for
it
forgot
you
that
was
it
pity

what

fond

of
nice
so
was
it
nelly
dear
my
illustration
miss
hatch
has
also
sent
me
an
original
letter
that
lewis
carroll
wrote
to
her
in
about
a
large
wax
doll
that
he
had
given
her
it
is
interesting
to
notice
that
this
letter
written
long
before
any
of
the
others
that
he
wrote
to
me
is
identically
the
same
in
form
and
expression
it
is
a
striking
proof
how
fresh
and
unimpaired
the
sympathies
must
have
been
year
after
year
he
retained
the
same
sweet
kindly
temperament
and
if
anything
his
love
for
children
seemed
to
increase
as
he
grew
older
my
dear
birdie
i
met
her
just
outside
tom
gate
walking
very
stiffly
and
i
think
she
was
trying
to
find
her
way
to
my
rooms
so
i
said
have
you
come
here
without
birdie
so
she
said
gone
and
emily
gone
and
mabel
is
kind
to
me
and
two
little
waxy
tears
came
running
down
her
cheeks
why
how
stupid
of
me
i
never
told
you
who
it
was
all
the
time
it
was
your
new
doll
i
was
very
glad
to
see
her
and
i
took
her
to
my
room
and
gave
her
some
vesta
matches
to
eat
and
a
cup
of
nice
melted
wax
to
drink
for
the
poor
little
thing
was
hungry
and
thirsty
after
her
long
walk
so
i
said
and
sit
down
by
the
fire
and
let
have
a
comfortable
chat
no
she
said
rather
not
you
know
i
do
melt
so
easily
and
she
made
me
take
her
quite
to
the
other
side
of
the
room
where
it
was
cold
and
then
she
sat
on
my
knee
and
fanned
herself
with
a
because
she
said
she
was
afraid
the
end
of
her
nose
was
beginning
to
melt
no
how
careful
we
have
to
be
we
dolls
she
said
there
was
a
sister
of
mine
would
you
believe
it
she
went
up
to
the
fire
to
warm
her
hands
and
one
of
her
hands
dropped
off
there
now
course
it
dropped
off
i
said
it
was
the
hand
how
do
you
know
it
was
the
hand
mister
carroll
the
doll
said
so
i
said
think
it
must
have
been
the
hand
because
the
other
hand
was
the
doll
said
sha
laugh
it
a
very
bad
joke
why
even
a
common
wooden
doll
could
make
a
better
joke
than
that
and
besides
they
made
my
mouth
so
stiff
and
hard
that
i
laugh
if
i
try
ever
so
much
be
cross
about
it
i
said
tell
me
this
i
going
to
give
birdie
and
the
other
children
one
photograph
each
which
ever
they
choose
which
do
you
think
birdie
will
choose
do
know
said
the
doll
better
ask
her
so
i
took
her
home
in
a
hansom
cab
which
would
you
like
do
you
think
arthur
as
cupid
or
arthur
and
wilfred
together
or
you
and
ethel
as
beggar
children
or
ethel
standing
on
a
box
or
one
of
yourself
your
affectionate
friend
lewis
carroll
among
the
bundle
of
letters
and
before
me
i
find
written
on
a
half
sheet
of
the
following
ollendorfian
dialogue
it
is
interesting
because
slight
and
trivial
as
it
is
it
in
some
strange
way
bears
the
imprint
of
lewis
carroll
style
the
thing
is
written
in
the
familiar
violet
ink
and
neatly
dated
in
the
corner
let
go
and
look
at
the
house
i
want
to
buy
now
do
be
quick
you
move
so
slow
what
a
time
you
take
with
your
boots
do
make
such
a
row
about
it
it
not
two
yet
how
do
you
like
house
i
do
like
it
it
too
far
down
the
hill
let
go
higher
i
heard
a
nice
account
of
one
at
the
top
built
on
an
improved
plan
what
does
the
rent
amount
to
oh
the
rent
all
right
it
only
nine
pounds
a
year
over
all
matters
connected
with
letter
writing
lewis
carroll
was
accustomed
to
take
great
pains
all
letters
that
he
received
that
were
of
any
interest
or
importance
whatever
he
kept
putting
them
away
in
old
biscuit
tins
numbers
of
which
he
kept
for
the
purpose
illustration
dolly
varden
in
he
published
a
little
book
which
he
called
eight
or
nine
wise
words
about
letter
writing
and
as
this
little
book
of
mine
is
so
full
of
letters
i
think
i
can
do
no
better
than
make
a
few
extracts
the
average
temper
of
the
human
race
would
be
perceptibly
sweeter
if
every
one
obeyed
this
rule
a
great
deal
of
the
bad
writing
in
the
world
comes
simply
from
writing
too
quickly
of
course
you
reply
do
it
to
save
time
a
very
good
object
no
doubt
but
what
right
have
you
to
do
it
at
your
friend
expense
is
time
as
valuable
as
yours
years
ago
i
used
to
receive
letters
from
a
friend
and
very
interesting
letters
too
written
in
one
of
the
most
atrocious
hands
ever
invented
it
generally
took
me
about
a
to
read
one
of
his
letters
i
used
to
carry
it
about
in
my
pocket
and
take
it
out
at
leisure
times
to
puzzle
over
the
riddles
which
composed
it
holding
it
in
different
positions
and
at
different
distances
till
at
last
the
meaning
of
some
hopeless
scrawl
would
flash
upon
me
when
i
at
once
wrote
down
the
english
under
it
and
when
several
had
thus
been
guessed
the
context
would
help
one
with
the
others
till
at
last
the
whole
series
of
hieroglyphics
was
deciphered
if
one
friends
wrote
like
that
life
would
be
entirely
spent
in
reading
their
letters
in
writing
the
last
wise
word
the
author
no
doubt
had
some
of
his
girl
correspondents
in
his
mind
eye
for
he
says
ninth
when
you
get
to
the
end
of
a
note
sheet
and
find
you
have
more
to
say
take
another
piece
of
paper
a
whole
sheet
or
a
scrap
as
the
case
may
demand
but
whatever
you
do
remember
the
old
proverb
writing
makes
cross
reading
proverb
you
say
inquiringly
old
well
not
so
ancient
i
must
confess
in
fact
i
afraid
i
invented
it
while
writing
this
paragraph
still
you
know
is
a
comparative
term
i
think
you
would
be
justified
in
addressing
a
chicken
just
out
of
the
shell
as
boy
with
another
chicken
that
was
only
half
out
i
have
another
diary
to
give
to
my
readers
a
diary
that
lewis
carroll
wrote
for
my
sister
maggie
when
a
tiny
child
she
came
to
oxford
to
play
the
child
part
mignon
in
booties
baby
he
was
delighted
with
the
pretty
play
for
the
interest
that
the
soldiers
took
in
the
little
lost
girl
and
how
a
mere
interest
ripened
into
love
till
the
little
mignon
was
queen
of
the
barracks
went
straight
to
his
heart
i
give
the
diary
in
full
maggie
visit
to
oxford
june
to
when
maggie
once
to
oxford
came
on
tour
as
baby
she
said
see
this
place
of
fame
however
dull
the
day
be
so
with
her
friend
she
visited
the
sights
that
it
was
rich
in
and
first
of
all
she
poked
her
head
inside
the
christ
church
kitchen
the
cooks
around
that
little
child
stood
waiting
in
a
ring
and
every
time
that
maggie
smiled
those
cooks
began
to
sing
shouting
the
of
freedom
boil
and
bake
for
maggie
sake
bring
cutlets
fine
for
to
dine
meringues
so
sweet
for
to
eat
for
maggie
may
be
bootles
baby
then
in
pleasant
talk
they
wandered
and
admired
the
hall
cathedral
and
broad
walk
till
maggie
feet
were
tired
one
friend
they
called
upon
her
name
was
hassall
then
into
a
college
room
they
came
some
savage
monster
den
when
that
monster
dined
i
guess
he
tore
her
limb
from
limb
well
no
in
fact
i
must
confess
that
dined
with
to
worcester
garden
next
they
strolled
admired
its
quiet
lake
then
to
john
a
college
old
their
devious
way
they
take
in
idle
mood
they
sauntered
round
its
lawns
so
green
and
flat
and
in
that
garden
maggie
found
a
lovely
a
quarter
of
an
hour
they
spent
in
wandering
to
and
fro
and
everywhere
that
maggie
went
that
cat
was
sure
to
go
shouting
the
of
freedom
miaow
come
make
your
bow
take
off
your
hats
ye
pussy
cats
and
purr
and
purr
to
welcome
for
maggie
may
be
bootles
baby
so
back
to
christ
church
not
too
late
for
them
to
go
and
see
a
christ
church
undergraduate
who
gave
them
cakes
and
tea
next
day
she
entered
with
her
guide
the
garden
called
and
there
a
fierce
she
spied
enough
to
cause
a
panic
but
maggie
did
mind
not
she
she
would
have
faced
that
fierce
because
you
see
the
thing
was
made
of
stone
on
magdalen
walls
they
saw
a
face
that
filled
her
with
delight
a
that
made
grimace
and
grinned
with
all
its
might
a
little
friend
industrious
pulled
upwards
all
the
while
the
corner
of
its
mouth
and
thus
he
helped
that
face
to
smile
nice
thought
maggie
would
be
if
could
have
a
friend
to
do
that
very
thing
for
and
make
my
mouth
turn
up
with
glee
by
pulling
at
one
end
in
magdalen
park
the
deer
are
wild
with
joy
that
maggie
brings
some
bread
a
friend
had
given
the
child
to
feed
the
pretty
things
they
flock
round
maggie
without
fear
they
breakfast
and
they
lunch
they
dine
they
sup
those
happy
deer
still
as
they
munch
and
munch
shouting
the
of
freedom
deer
are
we
and
dear
is
she
we
love
this
child
so
sweet
and
mild
we
all
rejoice
at
maggie
voice
we
all
are
fed
with
maggie
bread
for
maggie
may
be
bootles
baby
to
pembroke
college
next
they
go
where
little
maggie
meets
the
master
wife
and
daughter
so
once
more
into
the
streets
they
met
a
bishop
on
their
way
a
bishop
large
as
life
with
loving
smile
that
seemed
to
say
maggie
be
my
wife
maggie
thought
because
you
see
she
was
so
young
and
he
was
old
as
old
could
be
so
maggie
held
her
tongue
lord
she
we
are
going
up
and
down
her
friend
explained
she
may
see
the
sights
of
say
what
kind
of
place
it
is
the
bishop
gaily
cried
best
place
in
the
provinces
that
little
maid
replied
next
to
new
college
where
they
saw
two
players
hurl
about
a
hoop
but
by
what
rule
or
law
they
could
not
quite
make
out
the
game
is
called
although
graces
was
once
its
name
when
was
as
its
name
will
show
a
much
more
game
the
misses
symonds
next
they
sought
who
begged
the
child
to
take
a
book
they
long
ago
had
bought
a
gift
for
friendship
sake
away
next
morning
maggie
went
from
but
yet
the
happy
hours
she
there
had
spent
she
could
not
soon
forget
the
train
is
gone
it
rumbles
on
the
screams
but
maggie
deep
in
rosy
sleep
and
softly
in
her
dreams
whispers
the
of
freedom
she
seems
to
sigh
dear
old
city
with
gardens
pretty
and
lawns
and
flowers
and
and

a

the
tale
has
been
often
told
of
how
alice
in
wonderland
came
to
be
written
but
it
is
a
tale
so
well
worth
the
telling
again
that
very
shortly
i
will
give
it
to
you
here
years
ago
in
the
great
quadrangle
of
christ
church
opposite
to
dodgson
lived
the
little
daughters
of
dean
liddell
the
great
greek
scholar
and
dean
of
christ
church
the
little
girls
were
great
friends
of
dodgson
and
they
used
often
to
come
to
him
and
to
plead
with
him
for
a
fairy
tale
there
was
never
such
a
teller
of
tales
they
thought
one
can
imagine
the
whole
delightful
scene
with
little
trouble
that
big
cool
room
on
some
summer
afternoon
when
the
air
was
heavy
with
flower
scents
and
the
sounds
that
came
floating
in
through
the
open
window
were
all
mellowed
by
the
distance
one
can
see
him
that
good
and
kindly
gentleman
his
mobile
face
all
aglow
with
interest
and
love
telling
the
immortal
story
round
him
on
his
knee
sat
the
little
sisters
their
eyes
wide
open
and
their
lips
parted
in
breathless
anticipation
when
alice
how
the
little
alice
liddell
who
was
listening
must
have
loved
the
tale
rubbed
the
mushroom
and
became
so
big
that
she
quite
filled
the
little
fairy
house
one
can
almost
hear
the
rapturous
exclamations
of
the
little
ones
as
they
heard
of
it
the
story
often
continued
on
many
summer
afternoons
sometimes
in
the
cool
christ
church
rooms
sometimes
in
a
slow
gliding
boat
in
a
still
river
between
banks
of
rushes
and
strange
bronze
and
yellow
waterflowers
or
sometimes
in
a
great
with
the
insects
whispering
in
the
grass
all
round
grew
in
its
conception
and
idea
other
folk
older
folk
came
to
hear
of
it
from
the
little
ones
and
dodgson
was
begged
to
write
it
down
accordingly
the
first
was
prepared
with
great
care
and
illustrated
by
the
author
then
in
memorable
year
for
english
children
alice
appeared
in
its
present
form
with
sir
john
tenniel
drawings
in
alice
through
the
appeared
and
was
received
as
warmly
as
its
predecessor
that
fact
i
think
proves
most
conclusively
that
lewis
carroll
success
was
a
success
of
absolute
merit
and
due
to
no
mere
mood
or
fashion
of
the
public
taste
i
can
conceive
nothing
more
difficult
for
a
man
who
has
had
a
great
success
with
one
book
than
to
write
a
sequel
which
should
worthily
succeed
it
in
the
present
case
that
is
exactly
what
lewis
carroll
did
through
the
is
every
whit
as
popular
and
charming
as
the
older
book
indeed
one
depends
very
much
upon
the
other
and
in
every
child
one
sees
the
two
masterpieces

seek
her
aid
if
you
would
guess
my
riddle
while
on
the
subject
of
the
two
alices
i
will
put
in
a
letter
that
he
wrote
mentioning
his
books
he
was
so
modest
about
them
that
it
was
extremely
difficult
to
get
him
to
say
or
write
anything
at
all
about
them
i
believe
it
was
a
far
greater
pleasure
for
him
to
know
that
he
had
pleased
some
child
with
alice
or
the
hunting
of
the
snark
than
it
was
to
be
hailed
by
the
press
and
public
as
the
first
living
writer
for
children
eastbourne
my
own
darling
isa
the
full
value
of
a
copy
of
the
french
is
but
as
you
want
the
kind
and
as
you
are
a
great
friend
of
mine
and
as
i
am
of
a
very
noble
generous
disposition
i
have
made
up
my
mind
to
a
sacrifice
and
have
taken
off
the
price
so
that
you
do
not
owe
me
more
than
and
this
you
can
pay
me
in
gold
or
soon
as
you
ever
oh
dear
i
wonder
why
i
write
such
nonsense
can
you
explain
to
me
my
pet
how
it
happens
that
when
i
take
up
my
pen
to
write
a
letter
to
it
wo
write
sense
do
you
think
the
rule
is
that
when
the
pen
finds
it
has
to
write
to
a
nonsensical
child
it
sets
to
work
to
write
a
nonsensical
letter
well
now
i
tell
you
the
real
truth
as
miss
kitty
wilson
is
a
dear
friend
of
yours
of
course
she
a
of
a
friend
of
mine
so
i
thought
in
my
vanity
she
would
like
to
have
a
copy
from
the
author
her
name
written
in
it
so
i
sent
her
one
but
i
hope
she
understand
that
i
do
it
because
she
friend
for
you
see
i
had
never
of
her
before
so
i
would
have
any
other
reason
i
still
exactly
the
balance
like
those
scales
of
mine
when
nellie
says
wo
weigh
as
to
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
have
my
pet
isa
down
here
how
i
to
make
it
weigh
i
wonder
can
you
advise
any
way
to
do
it
i
getting
on
grandly
with
and
bruno
concluded
i
afraid
you
expect
me
to
give
you
a
copy
of
it
well
i
see
if
i
have
one
to
spare
it
wo
be
out
before
i
afraid
i
wonder
what
sort
of
condition
the
book
is
in
that
i
lent
you
to
take
to
america
parsonage
i
mean
very
shabby
i
expect
i
find
lent
books
come
back
in
good
condition
however
got
a
second
copy
of
this
book
so
you
may
keep
it
as
your
own
love
and
kisses
to
any
one
you
know
who
is
lovely
and
always
your
loving
uncle
in
appeared
the
long
poem
called
the
hunting
of
the
snark
or
an
agony
in
eight
fits
and
besides
those
verses
we
have
from
lewis
carroll
pen
two
books
called
phantasmagoria
and
rhyme
and
reason
the
last
work
of
his
that
attained
any
great
celebrity
was
sylvie
and
bruno
a
curious
romance
half
fairy
tale
half
mathematical
treatise
dodgson
was
employed
of
late
years
on
his
symbolic
logic
only
one
part
of
which
has
been
published
and
he
seems
to
have
been
influenced
by
his
studies
one
can
easily
trace
the
trail
of
the
logician
in
sylvie
and
bruno
and
perhaps
this
resulted
in
a
certain
lack
of
form
however
some
of
the
nonsense
verses
in
this
book
were
up
to
the
highest
level
of
the
author
achievement
even
as
i
write
the
verse
comes
to
me
he
thought
he
saw
a
kangaroo
turning
a
he
looked
again
and
found
it
was
a
vegetable
pill
i
to
swallow
you
he
said
should
be
very
ill
the
fascinating
jingle
stays
in
the
memory
when
graver
verse
eludes
all
effort
at
recollection
i
personally
could
repeat
the
walrus
and
the
carpenter
from
beginning
to
end
without
hesitation
but
i
should
find
a
difficulty
in
writing
ten
lines
of
hamlet
correctly
at
the
beginning
of
sylvie
and
bruno
is
a
little
poem
in
three
verses
which
forms
an
acrostic
on
my
name
i
quote
it
is
all
our
life
then
but
a
dream
seen
faintly
in
the
golden
gleam
athwart
time
dark
resistless
stream
bowed
to
the
earth
with
bitter
woe
or
laughing
at
some
we
flutter
idly
to
and
fro
man
little
day
in
haste
we
spend
and
from
its
merry
noontide
send
no
glance
to
meet
the
silent
end
you
see
that
if
you
take
the
first
letter
of
each
line
or
if
you
take
the
first
three
letters

feb
although
he
never

anything
in

line
he
once
wrote
a
prologue

private
theatricals
which
was
to
be
spoken
by
miss
hatch
and
her
brother
this
prologue
is
reproduced

miss
hatch
has
also
sent
me
a
charade
reproduced
on

which
he
wrote
for
her
and
illustrated
with
some
of
his
funny
drawings
i
have
one
more
letter
the
last
which
as
it
mentions
the
book
sylvie
and
bruno
i
will
give
now
christ
church
dearest
isa
i
had
this
was
and
bruno
bound
for
you
when
the
book
first
came
out
and
it
been
waiting
here
ever
since
for
i
really
did
dare
to
send
it
across
the
atlantic
the
whales
are
so
inconsiderate
they
have
been
sure
to
want
to
borrow
it
to
show
to
the
little
whales
quite
forgetting
that
the
salt
water
would
be
sure
to
spoil
it
also
i
only
been
waiting
for
you
to
get
back
to
send
emsie
the
alice
i
give
it
to
the
youngest
in
a
family
generally
but
i
given
one
to
maggie
as
well
because
she
travels
about
so
much
and
i
thought
she
would
like
to
have
one
to
take
with
her
i
hope
nellie
eyes
wo
get
green
with
jealousy
at
two
indeed
of
her
sisters
getting
presents
and
nothing
for
her
nothing
but
my
love
to
send
her
but
she
shall
have
ever
your
loving
uncle
charles
socially
lewis
carroll
was
of
strong
conservative
tendencies
he
viewed
with
wonder
and
a
little
pain
the
absolute
levelling
tendencies
of
the
last
few
years
of
his
life
i
have
before
me
an
extremely
interesting
letter
which
deals
with
social
observances
and
from
which
i
am
able
to
make
one
or
two
extracts
the
bulk
of
the
letter
is
of
a
private
nature
ladies
have
be
more
particular
than
gentlemen
in
observing
the
distinctions
of
what
is
called
position
and
the
their
own
position
is
in
the
scale
of
ship
the
more
jealous
they
seem
to
be
in
guarding
it
i
met
with
just
the
same
thing
myself
from
people
several
degrees
above
me
not
long
ago
i
was
staying
in
a
house
along
with
a
young
lady
about
twenty
years
old
i
should
think
with
a
title
of
her
own
as
she
was
an
daughter
i
happened
to
sit
next
her
at
dinner
and
every
time
i
spoke
to
her
she
looked
at
me
more
as
if
she
was
looking
down
on
me
from
about
a
mile
up
in
the
air
and
as
if
she
were
saying
to
herself
you
speak
to
why
you
not
good
enough
to
black
my
shoes
it
was
so
unpleasant
that
next
day
at
luncheon
i
got
as
far
off
her
as
i
could
of
course
we
are
all
equal
in
god
sight
but
we
make
a
lot
of
distinctions
some
of
them
quite
unmeaning
among
ourselves
the
picture
that
this
letter
gives
of
the
famous
writer
and
learned
mathematician
obviously
rather
in
terror
of
some
pert
young
lady
fresh
from
the
schoolroom
is
not
without
its
comic
side
one
can
not
help
imagining
that
the
girl
must
have
been
very
young
indeed
for
if
he
were
alive
there
are
few
ladies
of
any
state
who
would
not
feel
honoured
by
the
presence
of
charles
dodgson
however
he
was
not
always
so
unfortunate
in
his
experience
of
great
people
and
the
following
letter
written
when
he
was
staying
with
lord
salisbury
at
hatfield
house
tells
delightfully
of
his
little
royal
friends
the
duchess
of
albany
children
hatfield
house
hatfield
herts
my
darling
isa
i
hope
this
will
find
you
but
i
have
yet
had
any
letter
from
so
i
ca
be
sure
if
you
have
yet
got
into
your
new
house
this
is
lord
salisbury
house
he
is
the
father
you
know
of
that
lady
maud
wolmer
that
we
had
luncheon
with
i
came
yesterday
and
going
to
stay
until
monday
it
is
such
a
nice
house
to
stay
in
they
let
one
do
just
as
one
likes
it
is
you
must
do
some
geography
now
it
time
for
your
sums
the
sort
of
life
little
girls
have
to
lead
when
they
are
so
foolish
as
to
visit
friends
but
one
can
just
please
one
own
dear
self
there
are
some
sweet
little
children
staying
in
the
house
dear
little
is
here
with
her
mother
by
the
way
made
a
mistake
in
telling
you
what
to
call
her
she
is
honourable
mabel
is
the
family
name
is
the
just
as
the
name
of
lord
salisbury
is
so
that
his
daughter
was
lady
maud
cecil
till
she
married
then
there
is
the
duchess
of
albany
here
with
two
such
sweet
little
children
she
is
the
widow
of
prince
leopold
the
queen
youngest
son
so
her
children
are
a
prince
and
princess
the
girl
is
but
i
do
know
the
boy
christian
name
they
call
him
because
he
is
the
duke
of
albany
now
that
i
have
made
friends
with
a
real
live
little
princess
i
do
intend
ever
to
to
any
more
children
that
have
any
titles
in
fact
i
so
proud
and
i
hold
my
chin
so
high
that
i
should
even
you
if
we
met
no
darlings
you
must
believe
if
i
made
friends
with
a
princesses
i
would
love
you
better
than
all
of
them
together
even
if
i
had
them
all
rolled
up
into
a
sort
of
love
to
nellie
and
your
ever
loving
uncle
x
x
x
x
x
x
x
and
now
i
think
that
i
have
done
all
that
has
been
in
my
power
to
present
lewis
carroll
to
you
in
his
most
delightful
aspect
as
a
friend
to
children
i
have
not
pretended
in
any
way
to
write
an
exhaustive
of
the
man
who
was
so
dear
to
me
but
by
the
aid
of
the
letters
and
the
diaries
that
i
have
been
enabled
to
publish
and
by
the
few
reminiscences
that
i
have
given
you
of
lewis
carroll
as
i
knew
him
i
hope
i
have
done
something
to
bring
still
nearer
to
your
hearts
the
memory
of
the
greatest
friend
that
children
ever
had
footnotes
this
refers
to
my
visit
to
america
when
as
a
child
i
played
the
little
duke
of
york
in
richard
iii
at
this
point
