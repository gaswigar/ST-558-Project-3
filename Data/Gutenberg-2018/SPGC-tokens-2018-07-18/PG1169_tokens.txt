to

the
praises
of
agesilaus
in

equalling
his
virtue
and
renown
is
i
know
no
easy
task
yet
must
it
be
essayed
since
it
were
but
an
ill
requital
of
that
on
the
ground
of
his
perfection
a
good
man
should
forfeit
the
tribute
even
of
imperfect
praise
as
touching
therefore
the
excellency
of
his
birth
what
weightier
what
nobler
testimony
can
be
adduced
than
this
one
fact
to
the
commemorative
list
of
famous
ancestry
is
added
the
name
agesilaus
as
holding
this
or
that
numerical
descent
from
heracles
and
these
ancestors
no
private
persons
but
kings
sprung
from
the
loins
of
kings
nor
is
it
open
to
the
gainsayer
to
contend
that
they
were
kings
indeed
but
of
some
chance
city
not
so
but
even
as
their
family
holds
highest
honour
in
their
fatherland
so
too
is
their
city
the
most
glorious
in
hellas
whereby
they
hold
not
primacy
over
the
second
best
but
among
leaders
they
have
leadership
or
even
in
the
proud
of
his
ancestry
he
stands
commemorated
in
numerical
descent
from
heracles
and
herein
it
is
open
to
us
to
praise
both
his
fatherland
and
his
family
it
is
notable
that
never
throughout
these
ages
has
lacedaemon
out
of
envy
of
the
privilege
accorded
to
her
kings
tried
to
dissolve
their
rule
nor
ever
yet
throughout
these
ages
have
her
kings
strained
after
greater
powers
than
those
which
limited
their
heritage
of
kingship
from
the
first
wherefore
while
all
other
forms
of
government
democracies
and
oligarchies
tyrannies
and
monarchies
alike
have
failed
to
maintain
their
continuity
unbroken

claimed
the
succession
as
being
the
son
of
agis
and
agesilaus
as
the
son
of
archidamus
but
the
verdict
of
lacedaemon
favoured
agesilaus
as
being
in
point
of
family
and
virtue
unimpeachable
and
so
they
set
him
on
the
throne
and
yet
in
this
princeliest
of

so
to
be
selected
by

agesilaus
was
still
a
youth
when
he
obtained
the
kingdom
and
he
was
still
but
a
novice
in
his
office
when
the
news
came
that
the
king
of
persia
was
collecting
a
mighty
armament
by
sea
and
land
for
the
invasion
of
hellas
the
lacedaemonians
and
their
allies
sat
debating
these
matters
when
agesilaus
undertook
to
cross
over
into
asia
he
only
asked
for
thirty
spartans
and
two
thousand
new
citizens
besides
a
contingent
of
the
allies
six
thousand
strong
with
these
he
would
cross
over
into
asia
and
endeavour
to
effect

if
the
barbarian
preferred
war
he
would
leave
him
little

the
proposal
was
welcomed
with
enthusiasm
on
the
part
of
many
they
could
not
but
admire
the
eagerness
of
their
king
to
retaliate
upon
the
persian
for
his
former
invasions
of
hellas
by
on
his
own
soil
they
liked
the
preference
also
which
he
showed
for
attacking
rather
than
awaiting
his
enemy
attack
and
his
intention
to
carry
on
the
war
at
the
expense
of
persia
rather
than
that
of
hellas
but
it
was
the
perfection
of
policy
they
felt
so
to
change
the
arena
of
battle
with
asia
as
the
prize
of
victory
instead
of
hellas
if
we
pass
on
to
the
moment
when
he
had
received
his
army
and
set
sail
i
can
conceive
no
clearer
exposition
of
his
generalship
than
the
bare
narration
of
his
exploits
the
scene
is
asia
and
this
his
first
achievement
tissaphernes
had
sworn
an
oath
to
agesilaus
on
this
wise
if
agesilaus
would
grant
him
an
armistice
until
the
return
of
certain
ambassadors
whom
he
would
send
to
the
king
he
tissaphernes
would
do
his
utmost
to
procure
the
independence
of
the
hellenic
cities
in
asia
and
agesilaus
took
a
counter
oath
without
fraud
or
covin
to
observe
the
armistice
during
the
three
months
necessary
to
that
transaction
but
the
compact
was
scarcely
made
when
tissaphernes
gave
the
lie
to
the
solemn
undertaking
he
had
sworn
to
so
far
from
effecting
peace
he
begged
the
king
to
send
him
a
large
armament
in
addition
to
that
which
he
already
had
as
to
agesilaus
though
he
was
well
aware
of
these
proceedings
he
adhered
loyally
to
the
armistice
see
grote
x
hell
iii
iv
and
for
myself
i
look
upon
this
as
the
first
glorious
achievement
of
the
spartan
by
displaying
the
perjury
of
tissaphernes
he
robbed
him
of
his
credit
with
all
the
world
by
the
exhibition
of
himself
in
contrast
as
a
man
who
ratified
his
oath
and
would
not
gainsay
an
article
of
his
agreement
he
gave
all
men
hellenes
and
barbarians
alike
encouragement
to
make
covenant
with
him
to
the
full
extent
of
his
desire
when
tissaphernes
priding
himself
on
the
strength
of
that
army
which
had
come
down
to
aid
him
bade
agesilaus
to
be
gone
from
asia
or
to
prepare
for
war
deep
was
the
vexation
depicted
on
the
faces
of
the
lacedaemonians
there
present
and
their
allies
as
they
realised
that
the
scanty
force
of
agesilaus
was
all
too
small
to
cope
with
the
armaments
of
persia
but
the
brow
of
their
general
was
lit
with
joy
as
gaily
he
bade
the
ambassadors
take
back
this
answer
to
tissaphernes
i
hold
myself
indebted
to
your
master
for
the
perjury
whereby
he
has
obtained
to
himself
the
hostility
of
heaven
and
made
the
gods
themselves
allies
of
hellas
and
so
without
further
pause
he
published
a
general
order
to
his
soldiers
to
pack
their
baggage
and
prepare
for
active
service
and
to
the
several
cities
which
lay
on
the
line
of
march
to
caria
the
order
sped
to
have
their
markets
in
readiness
while
to
the
men
of
ionia
and
the
aeolid
and
the
hellespont
he
sent
despatches
bidding
them
send
their
contingents
to
ephesus
to
join
in
the
campaign
lit
when
tissaphernes
priding
himself
bade
agesilaus
be
gone
deep
was
the
annoyance
felt
tissaphernes
meanwhile
was
influenced
by
the
fact
that
agesilaus
had
no
cavalry
and
that
caria
was
a
hilly
district
unsuited
for
that
arm
moreover
as
he
further
bethought
him
agesilaus
must
needs
be
wroth
with
him
for
his
deceit
what
could
be
clearer
therefore
than
that
he
was
about
to
make
a
dash
at
the
satrap
home
in
caria
accordingly
he
transported
the
whole
of
his
infantry
into
caria
and
marched
his
cavalry
round
the
while
into
the
plain
of
the
maeander
persuaded
that
he
would
trample
the
hellenes
under
the
hoofs
of
his
horses
long
before
they
reached
the
district
where
no
cavalry
could
operate
but
agesilaus
instead
of
advancing
upon
caria
turned
right
about
and
marched
in
the
direction
of
phrygia
picking
up
the
various
forces
that
met
him
on
his
progress
he
passed
onwards
laying
city
after
city
at
his
feet
and
by
the
suddenness
of
his
incursion
capturing
enormous
wealth
here
was
an
achievement
which
showed
the
genius
of
a
general
as
all
agreed
when
once
war
as
declared
and
the
arts
of
circumvention
and
deceit
were
thereby
justified
he
had
proved
tissaphernes
to
be
a
very
bade
in
subtlety
and
with
what
sagacity
again
did
he
turn
the
circumstances
to
account
for
the
enrichment
of
his
friends
owing
to
the
quantity
of
wealth
captured
precious
things
were
selling
for
a
mere
song
thereupon
he
gave
his
friends
warning
to
make
their
purchases
adding
that
he
should
at
once
march
down
to
the
at
the
head
of
his
troops
the
quartermasters
meanwhile
received
orders
to
make
a
note
of
the
purchasers
with
the
prices
of
the
articles
and
to
consign
the
goods
the
result
was
that
without
prior
disbursement
on
their
part
or
detriment
to
the
public
treasury
his
friends
reaped
an
enormous
harvest
moreover
when
deserters
came
with
offers
to
disclose
hidden
treasures
and
naturally
enough
laid
their
proposal
before
the
king
himself
he
took
care
to
have
the
capture
of
these
treasures
effected
by
his
friends
which
would
enable
them
to
do
a
stroke
of
business
and
at
the
same
time
redound
to
their
prestige
for
this
reason
he
was
not
long
in
discovering
many
an
eager
aspirant
to
his
friendship
see
below

but
a
country
pillaged
and
denuded
of
inhabitants
would
not
long
support
an
army
that
he
felt
a
more
perennial
source
of
supply
was
surely
to
be
found
in
waving
cornfields
and
thickly
clustering
homesteads
so
with
infinite
pains
he
set
himself
not
merely
to
crush
his
foes
by
force
but
also
to
win
them
to
his
side
by
gentleness
in
this
spirit
he
often
enjoined
upon
his
soldiers
to
guard
their
captives
as
rather
than
take
vengeance
upon
them
as
evildoers
or
on
a
change
of
quarters
if
aware
of
little
children
left
behind
by
the
dealers
since
the
men
often
sold
them
in
the
belief
that
it
would
be
impossible
to
carry
them
away
and
rear
them
he
would
show
concern
in
behalf
of
these
poor
waifs
and
have
them
conveyed
to
some
place
of
safety
or
he
would
entrust
them
to
the
care
of
also
left
behind
on
account
of
old
age
in
no
case
must
they
be
left
to
ravening
dogs
and
wolves
in
this
way
he
won
the
goodwill
not
only
of
those
who
heard
tell
of
these
doings
but
of
the
prisoners
themselves
and
whenever
he
brought
over
a
city
to
his
side
he
set
the
citizens
free
from
the
harsher
service
of
a
bondsman
to
his
lord
imposing
the
gentler
obedience
of
a
freeman
to
his
ruler
indeed
there
were
fortresses
impregnable
to
assault
which
he
brought
under
his
power
by
the
subtler
force
of
human
kindness
see
grote
vol
ix
foll
but
when
in
phrygia
even
the
freedom
of
his
march
along
the
flats
was
hampered
by
the
cavalry
of
pharnabazus
he
saw
that
if
he
wished
to
avoid
a
skulking
warfare
under
cover
a
force
of
cavalry
was
indispensable
accordingly
he
enlisted
the
wealthiest
members
of
every
city
in
those
parts
to
breed
and
furnish
horses
with
this
saving
clause
however
that
the
individual
who
furnished
a
horse
and
arms
with
a
good
rider
should
be
exempt
from
service
himself
by
this
means
he
engendered
an
eagerness
to
discharge
the
obligation
not
unlike
that
of
the
condemned
man
casting
about
to
discover
some
one
to
die
in
his
place
he
further
ordered
some
of
the
states
themselves
to
furnish
contingents
of
mounted
troopers
and
this
in
the
conviction
that
from
such
he
would
presently
get
a
pick
of
cavaliers
proud
of
their
horsemanship
and
thus
once
more
he
won
golden
opinions
by
the
skill
with
which
he
provided
himself
with
a
body
of
cavalry
in
the
plenitude
of
strength
and
ripe
for
active
service

proposed

thereupon
it
was
a
sight
to
see
the
gymnasiums
thronged
with
warriors
going
through
their
exercises
the
racecourses
crowded
with
troopers
on
prancing
steeds
the
archers
and
the

men
shooting
at

nay
the
whole
city
in
which
he
lay
was
transformed
into
a
spectacle
itself
so
filled
to
overflowing
was
the
with
arms

armour
of

horses
all

here
were
coppersmiths
and
carpenters
ironfounders
and

painters
and
decorators
one
and
all
busily
engaged
in
fabricating
the
implements
of
war
so
that
an
onlooker
might
have
thought
the
city
of
ephesus
itself
a
gigantic
arsenal
it
would
have
kindled
courage
in
the
breast
of
a
coward
to
see
the
long
lines
of
soldiers
with
agesilaus
at
their
head
all
garlanded
as
they
marched
in
proud
procession
from
the
gymnasiums
and
dedicated
their
wreaths
to
our
lady
artemis
since
where
these
three
elements
exist
reverence
towards
heaven
practice
in
military
affairs
and
obedience
to
command
all
else
must
needs
be
full
of
happy
promise
but
seeing
that
contempt
for
the
foe
is
calculated
to
infuse
a
certain
strength
in
face
of
battle
he
ordered
his
criers
to
strip
naked
the
barbarians
captured
by
his
foraging
parties
and
so
to
sell
them
the
soldiers
who
saw
the
white
skins
of
these
folk
unused
to
strip
for
toil
soft
and
sleek
and
as
of
people
who
could
only
stir
abroad
in
carriages
concluded
that
a
war
with
women
would
scarcely
be
more
formidable
then
he
published
a
further
order
to
the
soldiers
i
shall

was
persuaded
that
this
was
all
talk
on

part
for
the
purpose
of
outwitting
him
a
second
time
now
certainly
agesilaus
would
make
an
incursion
into
caria
so
once

the

transported
his
infantry
over

done
before
and
as
before
he
posted
his

agesilaus
was

straight
upon
the
region
of
sardis
and
during
a
three
days
march
through
a
country
where
not
an
enemy
was
to
be
seen
provided
his
army
with
abundant
supplies
on
the
fourth

the
enemy
cavalry
came
up
the
persian
general
ordered
the
commandant
of
his
baggage
train
to
cross
the
pactolus
and
encamp
whilst
his
troopers
who
had
caught
sight
of
the
camp
followers
of
the
hellenes
scattered
in
search
of
booty
put
many
of
them
to
the
sword
agesilaus
aware
how
matters
were
going
ordered
his
cavalry
to
the
rescue
and
the
persians
on
their
side
seeing
the
enemy
supports
approaching
collected
and
formed
up
in
line
to
receive
them
with
the
serried
squadrons
of
their
cavalry
and
now
agesilaus
conscious
that
his
enemy
infantry
had
not
as
yet
arrived
whilst
on
his
side
no
element
in
his
preparation
was
lacking
felt
that
the
moment
was
come
to
join
battle
if
he
could
accordingly
he
sacrificed
and
advanced
against
the
opposing
lines
of
cavalry
a
detachment
of
heavy
infantry
the
men
had
orders
to
close
with
them
at
the
run
while
the
light
infantry
division
were
told
to
show
them
the
way
at
a
swinging
pace
at
the
same
time
he
passed
the
order
along
the
line
of
his
cavalry
to
charge
in
reliance
of
the
support
of
himself
and
the
main
body
in
their
rear
charge
they
did
these
troopers
and
the
pick
of
persian
cavalry
received
them
bravely
but
in
face
of
the
conjoint
horror
of
the
attack
they
swerved
and
some
were
cut
down
at
once
in
the
while
others
sought
safety
in
flight
the
hellenes
followed
close
on
the
heels
of
the
flying
foe
and
captured
his
camp
here
the
peltasts
not
unnaturally
fell
to
pillaging
whereupon
agesilaus
formed
a
cordon
of
troops
round
the
property
of
friends
and
foes
alike
and
so
encamped
presently
hearing
that
the
enemy
were
in
a
state
of
disorder
the
result
of
every
one
holding
his
fellow
responsible
for
what
had
happened
he
advanced
without
further
stay
on
sardis
having
arrived
he
fell
to
burning
and
ravaging
the
suburbs
while
at
the
same
time
he
did
not
fail
to
make
it
known
by
proclamation
that
those
who
asked
for
freedom
should
join
his
standard
or
if
there
were
any
who
claimed
a
right
of
property
in
asia
he
challenged
them
to
come
out
and
meet
her
liberators
in
fair
fight
and
let
the
sword
decide
between
them
finding
that
no
one
ventured
to
come
out
to
meet
him
his
march
became
for
the
future
a
peaceful
progress
all
around
him
he
beheld
hellenes
who
formerly
were
forced
to
bow
the
knee
to
brutal
governors
now
honoured
by
their
former
tyrants
while
those
who
had
claimed
to
enjoy
divine
honours
were
so
humbled
by
him
that
they
scarce
dared
to
look
a
hellene
in
the
face
everywhere
he
saved
the
territory
of
his
friends
from
devastation
and
reaped
the
fruits
of
the
enemy
soil
to
such
good
effect
that
within
two
years
he
was
able
to
dedicate
as
a
tithe
to
the
god
at
delphi
more
than
one
hundred
talents
pounds
nearly
it
was
then
that
the
persian
king
believing
that
tissaphernes
was
to
blame
for
the
ill
success
of
his
affairs
sent
down
tithraustes
and
cut
off
the
satrap
head
after
this
the
fortunes
of
the
barbarians
grew
still
more
desperate
whilst
those
of
agesilaus
assumed
a
bolder
front
on
all
side
embassies
from
the
surrounding
nations
came
to
make
terms
of
friendship
and
numbers
even
came
over
to
him
stretching
out
eager
arms
to
grasp
at
freedom
so
that
agesilaus
was
now
no
longer
the
chosen
captain
of
the
hellenes
only
but
of
many
asiatics
and
here
we
may
pause
and
consider
what
a
weight
of
admiration
is
due
to
one
who
being
now
ruler
over
countless
cities
of
the
continent
and
islands
also
since
the
state
had
further
entrusted
the
navy
to
his
hands
just
when
he
had
reached
this
pinnacle
of
renown
and
power
and
might
look
to
turn
to
account
his
thronging
fortunes
when
too
which
overtops
all
else
he
was
cherishing
fond
hopes
to
dissolve
that
empire
which
in
former
days
had
dared
to
march
on
hellas
at
such
a
moment
suffered
himself
not
to
be
overmastered
by
these
promptings
but
on
receipt
of
a
summons
of
the
home
authorities
to
come
to
the
assistance
of
the
fatherland
obeyed
the
mandate
of
his
state
as
readily
as
though
he
stood
confronted
face
to
face
with
the
five
in
the
hall
of
ephors
and
thus
gave
clear
proof
that
he
would
not
accept
the
whole
earth
in
exchange
for
the
land
of
his
fathers
nor
in
place
of
ancient
friends
nor
base
gains
ingloriously
purchased
rather
than
the
perilous
pursuit
of
honour
and
uprightness

and
indeed
glancing
back
at
the
whole
period
during
which
he
remained
in
the
exercise
of
his
authority
no
act
of
deeper
significance
in
proof
of
his
kingly
qualities
need
be
named
than
this
he
found
the
cities
which
he
was
sent
out
to
govern
each
and
all
a
prey
to
factions
the
result
of
constitutional
disturbances
consequent
on
the
cessation
of
the
athenian
empire
and
without
resort
to
exile
or
sanguinary
measures
he
so
disposed
them
by
his
healing
presence
that
civil
concord
and
material
prosperity
were
permanently
maintained
therefore
it
was
that
the
hellenes
in
asia
deplored
his
departure
as
though
they
had
lost
not
simply
a
ruler
but
a
father
or
bosom
friend
and
in
the
end
they
showed
that
their
friendship
was
of
no
fictitious
character
at
any
rate
they
voluntarily
helped
him
to
succour
lacedaemon
though
it
involved
as
they
knew
the
need
of
doing
battle
with
combatants
of
equal
prowess
with
themselves

the
tale
of
his
achievements
in

an
end

crossed

made
his

through

by
the
persian
with
his
multitudinous
equipment
in
former
days
and
the
march
which
cost
the
barbarian
a
year
was
accomplished
by
agesilaus
in
less
than
a
single
month
he
did
not
want
to
arrive
a
day
too
late
to
serve
his
fatherland

so
passing
through

who
were
in

his

his
troops
in

hollow

one
half
of

cavalry
in

the
other
half
on

finding
his
march
hindered
by
frequent
attacks
of
the
thessalians
on
his
hindmost
divisions
he
sent
round
the
mass
of
his
cavalry
from
the
vanguard
to
support
his
rear
reserving
only
his
personal
escort
and
now
in

the

the

not

in

round

to

distinctive
features
it
differed
from

of

day
the
contending
forces
met
on
the
plain
of
coronea
agesilaus
and
his
troops
approaching
from
the
cephisus
the
thebans
and
their
allies
from
the
slopes
of
the
helicon
these
masses
of
infantry
as
any
eye
might
see
were
of
duly
balanced
strength
while
as
near
as
could
be
the
cavalry
on
either
side
was
numerically
the
same
agesilaus
held
the
right
of
his
own
army
and
on
his
extreme
left
lay
the
men
of
orchomenus
on
the
opposite
side
the
thebans
themselves
formed
their
own
right
and
the
argives
held
their
left
while
the
two
armies
approached
a
deep
silence
prevailed
on
either
side
but
when
they
were
now
a
single
furlong
space
apart
the
thebans
quickened
to
a
run
and
with
a
loud
hurrah
dashed
forward
to
close
quarters
and
now
there
was
barely
a
hundred
yards
between
them
when
herippidas
with
his
foreign
brigade
rushed
forward
from
the
spartan
battle
lines
to
meet
them
this
brigade
consisted
partly
of
troops
which
had
served
with
agesilaus
ever
since
he
left
home
with
a
portion
of
the
cyreians
besides
ionians
aeolians
and
their
neighbours
on
the
hellespont
all
these
took
part
in
the
forward
rush
of
the
attack
just
mentioned
and
coming
within
they
routed
that
portion
of
the
enemy
in
front
of
them
the
argives
did
not
even
wait
for
agesilaus
and
his
division
but
fled
towards
helicon
and
at
that
moment
some
of
his
foreign
friends
were
on
the
point
of
crowning
agesilaus
with
the
wreath
of
victory

some
one
brought
him
word
that
the
thebans
had
cut
through
the
division
from

busy
with

he
at
once

his
division

against
them

their
side

that
their
allies
had
scattered
on

to

for
all
that
the
course
he
adopted
was
not

to
him
to
let
the
enemy
pass
in
their
effort
to
rejoin
their
friends

that
done

have
hung
upon
their

their

that
the
of

was
promised
to
him
by

venture
he
would
achieve

objects
which
were
to
requite
the
egyptian
for
the
benefits
conferred
on
lacedaemon
to
liberate
the
hellenes
in

once
again
and
to
inflict
on
the
persian
a
just
recompense
not
only
for
the
old
offences
but
for
this
which
was
of
seeing
that
while
boasting
alliance
with
sparta
he
had
dictatorially
enjoined
the
emancipation
of
messene
but
when
the
man
who
had
summoned
him
refused
to
confer
the
proffered
generalship
agesilaus
like
one
on
whom
a
flagrant
deception
has
been
practised
began
to
consider
the
part
he
had
to
play
meanwhile
a
separate
division
of
the
egyptian
armies
held
aloof
from
their
king
then
the
disaffection
spreading
all
the
rest
of
his
troops
deserted
him
whereat
the
monarch
took
flight
and
retired
in
exile
to
sidon
in
phoenicia
leaving
the
egyptians
split
in
faction
to
choose
to
themselves
a
pair
of
kings
thereupon
agesilaus
took
his
decision
if
he
helped
neither
it
meant
that
neither
would
pay
the
due
to
his
hellenes
that
neither
would
provide
a
market
and
that
whichever
of
the
two
conquered
in
the
end
sparta
would
be
equally
detested
but
if
he
threw
in
his
lot
with
one
of
them
that
one
would
in
all
likelihood
in
return
for
the
kindness
prove
a
friend
accordingly
he
chose
between
the
two
that
one
who
seemed
to
be
the
truer
partisan
of
hellas
and
with
him
marched
against
the
enemy
of

conquered
him

him
his
rival

helped
to
establish
on

throne

having
made
him
a
friend
to

having
acquired
vast
sums
besides
he
turned
and
set
sail
homewards
even
in
hastening
so
that
sparta
might
not
lie
inactive

against
the
coming
summer
be
alert
to

he
clung

name

illustrious
examples
such
was

the
persian
who
knew

negotiating

the

great
king
was
minded

seize

spithridates
delivered

his

his

refused
to
obey
a
summons
from

although
he
sent
him

right
hand
then
fear
came
upon
him
lest
he
should
be
seized
and
either
be
heavily
fined
or
die

death
yet
he
too
simply
trusting
to

came
to
the
camp

made

of
his

accord
chose
to
take
the
field
with
agesilaus
bringing
a

horsemen
and
two
thousand
targeteers
lastly
pharnabazus
himself
came
and
held
colloquy
with
agesilaus
and
openly
agreed
that
if
he
were
not
himself
appointed
of

forces
he
would
revolt

a

was
not

to
commit

the

agesilaus
judged
it
not

wrong
to
forgo
repayment
of
a
deed
of
kindness

where

might
have
done
so
by
the
aid

goes
a
long
way
to
prove
his
indifference
to
the
lure
of
riches
since
had
he
been
in
the
habit
of
selling
his
favour
or
of
playing
the
part
of
benefactor
for
pay
there
had
been
no
room

here

it

the

houses

always
lay
up
in
some
sacred
place
where
behaviour
of

was
out

of
all

liable
to

this
were

to
dispraise
myself

than
the
seductions
in

vi
nor
in
my
opinion
were
those
obscure
proofs
of
courage
and
true
manliness
which
he
furnished
by
his
readiness
ever
to
wage
war
against
the
strongest
enemies
whether
of
sparta
or
of
hellas
placing
himself
in
the
forefront
of
the
contests
decided
on
if
the
enemy
cared
to
join
issue
in
fair
field
he
would
not
chance
upon
a
victory
won
by
panic
but
in
stubborn
battle
blow
for
blow
he
mastered
him
and
set
up
trophies
worthy
of
the
name
seeing
that
he
left
behind
him
imperishable
monuments
of
prowess
and
bore
away
on
his
own

indelible
marks
of
the
fury
with
which
he
fought

apart

and
amongst
these
we
must
not
deem
them
trophies
alone
which
he
actually
set
up

reckon
the
many
campaigns
which
he
undertook

they
were

victories
devoid

in

of

won

a

that

of

since
as
i

of

but
must
finally
resolve
itself
into
that
for
to
put
it
briefly
we
all
know
well
that
where
agesilaus
expected
in
any
way
to
benefit
his
country
there
was
no
toil
he
shrank
from
no
danger
he
avoided
no
money
he
stinted
no
excuse
whether
of
age
or
body
he
admitted
but
deemed
it
ever
the
true
function
of
a
good
king
to
shower
blessings
to
the
utmost
on
the
subjects
of
his
rule
lit
love
for
his
own
city
or
regarded
it
as
the
cardinal
virtue
of
a
real
prince
see

and
for
my
part
i
hold
it
as
chief
among
the
magnificent
benefits
so
conferred
by
him
upon
his
country
that
being
the
most
powerful
member
of
the
state
he
made
no
secret
of
his
absolute
submission
to
the
laws
since
what
lesser
man
seeing
the
king
obedience
would
take
on
himself
to
disobey
who
in
discontentment
at
his
own
poor
lot
would
venture
on
revolution
knowing
that
the
king
himself
could
condescend
to
constitutional
control
and
that
too
a
king
who
bore
himself
towards
political
opponents
with
a
paternal
mildness
if
he
rebuked
them
sharply
for
their
misdemeanours
he
none
the
less
honoured
their
high
endeavours
and
proved
himself
a
present
help
to
them
in
time
of
trouble
no
citizen
could
be
his
personal
foe
of
that
he
was
assured
his
desire
was
to
commend
them
one
and
all
alike
counting
the
common
salvation
of
all
a
gain
and
reckoning
it
as
a
loss
if
even
a
mean
man
perished
for
thus
he
reasoned
nor
made
a
secret
of
the
conclusion
he
had
come
to
so
long
as
her
citizens
continued
tranquilly
adherent
to
the
laws
the
happiness
of
sparta
was
secure
and
for
the
rest
sparta
would
once
again
be
strong
on
that
day
when
the
states
of
hellas
should
learn
wisdom
or
he
was
at
the
same
time
the
most
obvious
in
his
allegiance
to
the
laws
lit
would
have
taken
on
himself
would
have
ventured
on
revolution
lit
as
a
father
to
his
children
or
and
was
ready
to
stand
by
their
side
in
time
of
trouble
or
for
this
was
the
clear
tenor
of
his
thought
that
by
tranquil
continuance
within
the
laws
the
citizens
of
sparta
might
secure
her
happiness
and
as
to
power
sparta

see

and
if
by
admission
it
is
noble
for
every
hellene
to
be
a
lover
of
his
yet
we
must
fare
far
afield
to
find
another
instance
of
a
general
who
expecting
to
sack
some
city
would
have
refused
to
seize
the
prize
or
who
regarded
victory
in
a
war
waged
against
as
a
species
of
calamity

this
man
when
a
message
was
brought
him
concerning
the
battle
at
corinth
in
which
but
eight
lacedaemonians
had
fallen
but
of
their
opponents
ten
thousand
nearly
showed
no
sign
of
exultation
but
sighed
saying
alas
for
hellas
since
those
who
now
lie
in
their
graves
were
able
had
they
lived
to
conquer
the
hosts
of
asia
again
when
some
corinthian
exiles
informed
him
that
their
city
was
ripe
for
surrender
and
showed
him
the
engines
by
which
they
were
confident
they
would
take
the
walls
he
refused
to
make
the
assault
saying
that
hellene
cities
ought
not
to
be
reduced
to
slavery
but
brought
back
to
a
better
mind

added

that

which

by

he
disdained
to
accept
it
telling
the
bearer
to
take
back
to
the
king
this
answer
he
need
not
be
at
pains
to
send
him
letters
in

but
if
he
could
prove
himself
a
friend
to

and
the
of

he
should
have
no
cause
to
blame
the

of
his

but
added
if

detected
plotting
let
him
not
think
to
find
a

in

if

me
a

then
i
hold
it
praiseworthy
that
by

slowly
the

was
never

when

no

agesilaus
was

the

not

gave

sense
of
contrast
lay
a
double
satisfaction
here
was
he
roaming
earth
freely
in
the
midst
of

world

delight
and
there
lay
the
persian

escape

life
of
pain
must
drag
together
from
the
uttermost
parts
of

the
separate
ingredients
for

it
was
another
source

joy
that
to
himself
it

confront
the
appointed
order
of
the
universe
without
pain
while
through
weakness

soul
his

that
thus
his

may

as

agesilaus
reverenced

of
the

we
ought
he
said
to
make
the
gods
our
allies
on
hostile
no
less
than
on
friendly
soil
he
would
do
no
violence
to
a
suppliant
no
not
even
if
he
were
his
own
foe
since
how
irrational
must
it
be
to
stigmatise
robbers
of
temples
as
sacrilegious
and
yet
to
regard
him
who
tears
the
suppliant
from
the
altar
as
a
pious
person
one
tenet
he
never
wearied
of
repeating
the
gods
he
said
are
not
less
pleased
with
holy
deeds
than
with
pure
victims
in
the
day
of
his
prosperity
his
thoughts
were
not
raised
higher
than
befits
a
man
he
gave
thanks
to
the
gods
and
offered
more
victims
when
he
had
nothing
to
fear
than
he
registered
vows
in
time
of
apprehension
he
was
accustomed
in
the
midst
of
anxiety
to
wear
an
aspect
of
gaiety
but
when
the
victory
was
won
of
gentleness
amongst
friends
his
warmest
greeting
was
reserved
not
for
the
most
powerful
but
for
the
most
ardent
and
if
he
hated
it
was
not
him
who
being
evil
entreated
retaliated
but
one
who
having
had
kindness
done
to
him
seemed
incapable
of
gratitude
he
rejoiced
when
sordid
greed
was
rewarded
with
poverty
and
still
more
if
he
might
himself
enrich
a
righteous
man
since
his
wish
was
to
render
uprightness
more
profitable
than
iniquity
he
made
it
a
practice
to
associate
with
all
kinds
of
people
but
to
be
intimate
only
with
the
best
as
he
listened
to
the
praise
of
this
man
or
the
censure
of
another
he
felt
that
he
learnt
quite
as
much
about
the
character
of
the
speakers
themselves
as
of
those
whom
they
discussed
to
be
cheated
by
a
friend
was
scarcely
censurable
but
he
could
find
no
condemnation
strong
enough
for
him
who
was
outwitted
by
a
foe
or
again
to
dupe
the
incredulous
might
argue
wit
but
to
take
in
the
unsuspecting
was
veritably
a
crime
the
praise
of
a
critic
who
had
courage
to
point
out
his
defects
pleased
him
and
plainness
of
speech
excited
in
him
no
hostility
it
was
against
the
cunning
rather
of
the
secretive
person
that
he
guarded
himself
as
against
a
hidden
snare
the
calumniator
he
detested
more
than
the
robber
or
the
thief
in
proportion
as
the
loss
of
friends
is
greater
than
the
loss
of
money

neglect

for

was
one
of

small
band
as
it
seemed
to
me
who
regard
virtue
not
as
a
thing
to
be
patiently
endured
but
as
a
supreme
enjoyment
at
any
rate
to
win
the
praise
of
mankind
gave
him
a
deeper
pleasure
than
the
acquisition
of
wealth
and
he
preferred
to
display
courage
far
rather
in
conjunction
with
prudence
than
with
unnecessary
risks
and
to
cultivate
wisdom
in
action
more
than
by
verbal

endurance

was
most
terrible
whilst
he
could
hold
out
against
toil

trouble
with
the
best
nothing
pleased
him
better
than
yielding
to

but
passion
was
kindled
in
him

beauty

deed
rather

of
person
or

rather

in

stout

heart
enough
in

urbanity
he
practised
not
with
jest
and
witticism
but
by
the
courtesy
of
his
demeanour
in
spite
of
a
certain
haughtiness
he
was
never
overbearing
but
rich
in
saving
common
sense
at
any
rate
while
pouring
contempt
upon
arrogance
he
bore
himself
more
humbly
than
the
most
ordinary
man
in
fact
what
he
truly
took
a
pride
in
was
the
simplicity
of
his
own
attire
in
contrast
with
the
splendid
adornment
of
his
troops
or
again
in
the
paucity
of
his
own
wants
combined
with
a
bountiful
liberality
towards
his
friends
besides
all
this
as
an
antagonist
he
could
hit
hard
enough
but
no
one
ever
bore
a
lighter
hand
when
the
victory
was
won
lit
he
was
the
heaviest
of
antagonists
and
the
lightest
of
conquerors
the
same
man
whom
an
enemy
would
have
found
it
hard
to
deceive
was
pliability
itself
in
the
concerns
of
his
friends
whilst
for
ever
occupied
in
laying
these
on
a
secure
foundation
he
made
it
a
ceaseless
task
to
baffle
the
projects
of
the
national
foe

epithets
applied
to
him
are
significant
his
relatives
found
in
him
