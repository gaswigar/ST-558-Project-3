part
one
the
chapter
i
all
her
life
miss
elizabeth
dwarris
had
been
a
sore
trial
to
her
relations
a
woman
of
means
she
ruled
tyrannously
over
a
large
number
of
impecunious
cousins
using
her
like
the
scorpions
of
rehoboam
to
chastise
them
and
like
many
another
pious
creature
for
their
soul
s
good
making
all
and
sundry
excessively
miserable
nurtured
in
the
evangelical
ways
current
in
her
youth
she
insisted
that
her
connections
should
seek
salvation
according
to
her
own
lights
and
with
harsh
tongue
and
with
bitter
gibe
made
it
her
constant
business
to
persuade
them
of
their
extreme
unworthiness
she
arranged
lives
as
she
thought
fit
and
ventured
not
only
to
order
the
costume
and
habits
but
even
the
inner
thought
of
those
about
her
the
last
judgment
could
have
no
terrors
for
any
that
had
faced
her
searching
examination
she
invited
to
stay
with
her
in
succession
various
poor
ladies
who
presumed
on
a
distant
tie
to
call
her
aunt
eliza
and
they
accepted
her
summons
more
imperious
than
a
royal
command
with
gratitude
by
no
means
unmixed
with
fear
bearing
the
servitude
meekly
as
a
cross
which
in
the
future
would
meet
due
testamentary
reward
miss
dwarris
loved
to
feel
her
power
during
these
long
visits
for
in
a
way
the
old
lady
was
very
hospitable
she
made
it
her
especial
object
to
break
the
spirit
of
her
guests
and
it
entertained
her
hugely
to
see
the
mildness
with
which
were
borne
her
extravagant
demands
the
humility
with
which
every
inclination
was
crushed
she
took
a
malicious
pleasure
in
publicly
affronting
persons
ostensibly
to
bend
a
sinful
pride
or
in
obliging
them
to
do
things
which
they
particularly
disliked
with
a
singular
quickness
for
discovering
the
points
on
which
they
were
most
sensitive
she
attacked
every
weakness
with
blind
invective
till
the
sufferer
writhed
before
her
raw
and
bleeding
no
defect
physical
or
mental
was
protected
from
her
raillery
and
she
could
pardon
as
little
an
excess
of
avoirdupois
as
a
want
of
memory
yet
with
all
her
heart
she
despised
her
victims
she
flung
in
their
face
insolently
their
mercenary
spirit
vowing
that
she
would
never
leave
a
penny
to
such
a
pack
of
weak
fools
it
delighted
her
to
ask
for
advice
in
the
distribution
of
her
property
among
charitable
societies
and
she
heard
with
unconcealed
hilarity
their
unwilling
and
confused
suggestions
with
one
of
her
relations
only
miss
dwarris
found
it
needful
to
observe
a
certain
restraint
for
miss
ley
perhaps
the
most
distant
of
her
cousins
was
as
as
herself
and
had
besides
a
far
keener
wit
whereby
she
could
turn
rash
statements
to
the
utter
ridicule
of
the
speaker
nor
did
miss
dwarris
precisely
dislike
this
independent
spirit
she
looked
upon
her
in
fact
with
a
certain
degree
of
affection
and
not
a
little
fear
miss
ley
seldom
lacking
a
repartee
appeared
really
to
enjoy
the
verbal
contests
from
which
by
her
greater
urbanity
readiness
and
knowledge
she
usually
emerged
victorious
it
confounded
but
at
the
same
time
almost
amused
the
elder
lady
that
a
woman
so
much
poorer
than
herself
with
no
smaller
claims
than
others
to
the
coveted
inheritance
should
venture
not
only
to
be
facetious
at
her
expense
but
even
to
carry
war
into
her
very
camp
miss
ley
really
not
grieved
to
find
some
one
to
whom
without
prickings
of
conscience
she
could
speak
her
whole
mind
took
a
grim
pleasure
in
pointing
out
to
her
cousin
the
poor
logic
of
her
observations
or
the
foolish
unreason
of
her
acts
no
cherished
opinion
of
miss
dwarris
was
safe
from
satire
even
her
evangelicism
was
laughed
at
and
the
rich
old
woman
unused
to
argument
was
easily
driven
into
and
then
for
the
victor
took
no
pains
to
conceal
her
triumph
she
grew
pale
and
speechless
with
rage
the
quarrels
were
frequent
but
miss
dwarris
though
it
was
a
sharp
thorn
in
her
flesh
that
the
first
advances
must
be
made
by
her
in
the
end
always
forgave
yet
at
last
it
was
inevitable
that
a
final
breach
should
occur
the
cause
thereof
characteristically
enough
was
very
trivial
miss
ley
accustomed
when
she
went
abroad
in
the
winter
to
let
her
little
flat
in
chelsea
had
been
obliged
by
unforeseen
circumstances
to
return
to
england
while
her
tenants
were
still
in
possession
and
had
asked
miss
dwarris
whether
she
might
stay
with
her
in
old
queen
street
the
old
tyrant
much
as
she
hated
her
relations
hated
still
more
to
live
alone
she
needed
some
one
on
whom
to
vent
her
temper
and
through
the
illness
of
a
niece
due
to
spend
march
and
april
with
her
had
been
forced
to
pass
a
month
of
solitude
she
wrote
back
in
the
peremptory
fashion
which
even
with
miss
ley
she
could
not
refrain
from
using
that
she
expected
her
on
such
and
such
a
day
by
such
and
such
a
train
it
is
not
clear
whether
there
was
in
the
letter
anything
to
excite
in
miss
ley
a
contradictory
spirit
or
whether
her
engagements
really
prevented
it
but
at
all
events
she
answered
that
her
plans
made
it
more
convenient
to
arrive
on
the
day
following
and
by
a
different
train
miss
dwarris
telegraphed
that
unless
her
guest
came
on
the
day
and
at
the
hour
mentioned
in
her
letter
she
could
not
send
the
carriage
to
meet
her
to
which
the
younger
lady
replied
concisely
don
she
s
as
obstinate
as
a
pig
muttered
miss
dwarris
reading
the
telegram
and
she
saw
in
her
mind
s
eye
the
thin
smile
on
her
cousin
s
mouth
when
she
wrote
that
one
indifferent
word
i
suppose
she
thinks
she
s
very
her
hostess
greeted
miss
ley
notwithstanding
with
a
certain
grim
affability
reserved
only
for
her
she
was
at
all
events
the
least
detestable
of
her
relations
and
though
neither
docile
nor
polite
at
least
was
never
tedious
her
conversation
braced
miss
dwarris
so
that
with
her
she
was
usually
at
her
best
and
sometimes
forgetting
her
overbearing
habit
showed
herself
a
sensible
and
entertaining
woman
of
not
altogether
unamiable
disposition
you
re
growing
old
my
dear
said
miss
dwarris
when
they
sat
down
to
dinner
looking
at
her
guest
with
eyes
keen
to
detect
wrinkles
and
crowsfeet
you
flatter
me
miss
ley
retorted
antiquity
is
the
only
excuse
for
a
woman
who
has
determined
on
a
single
i
suppose
like
the
rest
of
them
you
would
have
married
if
any
one
had
asked
miss
ley
smiled
two
months
ago
an
italian
prince
offered
me
his
hand
and
heart
a
papist
would
do
anything
replied
miss
dwarris
i
suppose
you
told
him
your
income
and
he
found
he
d
misjudged
the
strength
of
his
i
refused
him
because
he
was
so
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
at
your
age
you
could
afford
to
pick
and
choose
allow
me
to
observe
that
you
have
an
amiable
faculty
of
thinking
of
one
subject
at
one
time
in
two
diametrically
opposed
miss
ley
was
a
slender
woman
of
middle
size
her
hair
very
plainly
arranged
beginning
to
turn
gray
and
her
face
already
much
wrinkled
by
its
clear
precision
of
feature
indicating
a
comfortable
strength
of
character
her
lips
thin
but
expressive
mobile
added
to
this
appearance
of
determination
she
was
by
no
means
handsome
and
had
certainly
never
been
pretty
but
her
carriage
was
not
without
grace
nor
her
manner
without
fascination
her
eyes
were
very
bright
and
so
shrewd
as
sometimes
to
be
almost
disconcerting
without
words
they
could
make
pretentiousness
absurd
and
most
affectations
under
that
searching
glance
part
contemptuous
part
amused
willingly
hid
themselves
yet
as
miss
dwarris
took
care
to
remind
her
she
was
not
without
her
own
especial
pose
but
it
was
carried
out
so
admirably
with
such
a
restrained
comely
decorum
that
few
observed
it
and
such
as
did
found
not
the
heart
to
condemn
it
was
the
perfect
art
that
concealed
itself
to
execute
this
Ã¦sthetic
gesture
it
pleased
miss
ley
to
dress
with
the
greatest
possible
simplicity
usually
in
black
and
her
only
ornament
was
a
renaissance
jewel
of
such
exquisite
beauty
that
no
museum
would
have
disdained
to
possess
it
this
she
wore
around
her
neck
attached
to
a
long
gold
chain
and
she
fingered
it
with
pleasure
to
show
according
to
her
relative
the
undoubted
beauty
of
her
hands
her
shoes
and
the
elaborate
of
her
silk
stockings
suggested
also
a
not
unreasonable
pride
in
a
shapely
foot
small
and
high
of
instep
thus
attired
when
she
had
visitors
miss
ley
sat
in
an
oak
italian
chair
delicately
carved
which
was
placed
between
two
windows
against
the
wall
and
she
cultivated
already
a
certain
primness
of
manner
which
made
very
effective
the
audacious
criticism
of
life
wherewith
she
was
used
to
entertain
her
friends
two
mornings
after
her
arrival
in
old
queen
street
miss
ley
announced
her
intention
to
go
out
she
came
downstairs
with
a
very
fashionable
parasol
a
purchase
on
her
way
through
paris
you
re
not
going
out
with
that
thing
cried
miss
dwarris
scornfully
i
am
nonsense
you
must
take
an
umbrella
it
s
going
to
i
have
a
new
sunshade
and
an
old
umbrella
eliza
i
feel
certain
it
will
be
my
dear
you
know
nothing
about
the
english
climate
i
tell
you
it
will
pour
cats
and
fiddlesticks
polly
answered
miss
dwarris
her
temper
rising
i
wish
you
to
take
an
umbrella
the
barometer
is
going
down
and
i
have
a
tingling
in
my
feet
which
is
a
sure
sign
of
wet
it
s
very
irreligious
of
you
to
presume
to
say
what
the
weather
is
going
to
i
venture
to
think
that
meteorologically
i
am
no
less
acquainted
with
the
ways
of
providence
than
that
i
think
is
not
funny
but
blasphemous
polly
in
my
house
i
expect
people
to
do
as
i
tell
them
and
i
insist
on
your
taking
an
don
t
be
absurd
miss
dwarris
rang
the
bell
and
when
the
butler
appeared
ordered
him
to
fetch
her
own
umbrella
for
miss
ley
i
absolutely
refuse
to
use
it
said
the
younger
lady
smiling
pray
remember
that
you
are
my
guest
and
therefore
entitled
to
do
exactly
as
i
miss
dwarris
rose
to
her
feet
a
massive
old
woman
of
commanding
presence
and
stretched
out
a
threatening
hand
if
you
leave
this
house
without
an
umbrella
you
shall
not
come
into
it
again
you
shall
never
cross
this
threshold
so
long
as
i
am
miss
ley
can
not
have
been
in
the
best
of
humours
that
morning
for
she
pursed
her
lips
in
the
manner
already
characteristic
of
her
and
looked
at
her
elderly
cousin
with
a
cold
scorn
most
difficult
to
bear
my
dear
eliza
you
have
a
singularly
exaggerated
idea
of
your
importance
are
there
no
hotels
in
london
you
appear
to
think
i
stay
with
you
for
pleasure
rather
than
to
mortify
my
flesh
and
really
the
cross
is
growing
too
heavy
for
me
for
i
think
you
must
have
quite
the
worst
cook
in
the
she
s
been
with
me
for
five
and
twenty
years
answered
miss
dwarris
two
red
spots
appearing
on
her
cheeks
and
no
one
has
ventured
to
complain
of
the
cooking
before
if
any
of
my
guests
had
done
so
i
should
have
answered
that
what
was
good
enough
for
me
was
a
great
deal
too
good
for
any
one
else
i
know
that
you
re
obstinate
polly
and
and
this
impertinence
i
am
willing
to
overlook
do
you
still
refuse
to
do
as
i
wish
miss
dwarris
rang
the
bell
violently
tell
martha
to
pack
miss
ley
s
boxes
at
once
and
call
a
she
cried
in
tones
of
thunder
very
well
madam
answered
the
butler
used
to
his
mistress
s
vagaries
then
miss
dwarris
turned
to
her
guest
who
observed
her
with
irritating
i
hope
you
realise
polly
that
i
fully
mean
what
i
all
is
over
between
us
answered
miss
ley
mockingly
and
shall
i
return
your
letters
and
your
photographs
miss
dwarris
sat
for
a
while
in
silent
anger
watching
her
cousin
who
took
up
the
and
with
great
calmness
read
the
fashionable
intelligence
presently
the
butler
announced
that
the
was
at
the
door
well
polly
so
you
re
really
going
i
can
hardly
stay
when
you
ve
had
my
boxes
packed
and
sent
for
a
cab
replied
miss
ley
mildly
it
s
your
own
doing
i
don
t
wish
you
to
go
if
you
ll
confess
that
you
were
headstrong
and
obstinate
and
if
you
ll
take
an
umbrella
i
am
willing
to
let
bygones
be
look
at
the
sun
answered
miss
ley
and
as
if
actually
to
annoy
the
tyrannous
old
woman
the
shining
rays
danced
into
the
room
and
made
importunate
patterns
on
the
carpet
i
think
i
should
tell
you
polly
that
it
was
my
intention
to
leave
you
ten
thousand
pounds
in
my
will
this
intention
i
shall
of
course
not
now
carry
you
d
far
better
leave
your
money
to
the
dwarris
people
upon
my
word
considering
that
they
ve
been
related
to
you
for
over
sixty
years
i
think
they
thoroughly
deserve
i
shall
leave
my
money
to
whom
i
choose
cried
miss
dwarris
beside
herself
and
if
i
want
to
i
shall
leave
every
penny
of
it
in
charity
you
re
very
independent
because
you
have
a
beggarly
five
hundred
a
year
but
apparently
it
isn
t
enough
for
you
to
live
without
letting
your
flat
when
you
go
away
remember
that
no
one
has
any
claims
upon
me
and
i
can
make
you
a
rich
miss
ley
replied
with
great
deliberation
my
dear
i
have
a
firm
conviction
that
you
will
live
for
another
thirty
years
to
plague
the
human
race
in
general
and
your
relations
in
particular
it
is
not
worth
my
while
on
the
chance
of
surviving
you
to
submit
to
the
caprices
of
a
very
ignorant
old
woman
presumptuous
and
overbearing
dull
and
miss
dwarris
gasped
and
shook
with
rage
but
the
other
proceeded
without
mercy
you
have
plenty
of
poor
relations
bully
them
vent
your
spite
and
on
those
wretched
sycophants
but
pray
in
future
spare
me
the
infinite
tediousness
of
your
miss
ley
had
ever
a
discreet
passion
for
the
rhetorical
and
there
was
a
certain
grandiloquence
about
the
phrase
which
entertained
her
hugely
she
felt
that
it
was
unanswerable
and
with
great
dignity
walked
out
no
communication
passed
between
the
two
ladies
though
miss
dwarris
peremptory
stern
and
evangelical
to
the
end
lived
in
full
possession
of
her
faculties
for
another
twenty
years
she
died
at
last
in
a
passion
occasioned
by
some
trifling
misdemeanour
of
her
maid
and
as
though
a
heavy
yoke
were
removed
from
their
shoulders
her
family
heaved
a
deep
and
unanimous
sigh
of
relief
they
attended
her
funeral
with
dry
eyes
looking
still
with
silent
terror
at
the
leaden
coffin
which
contained
the
remains
of
that
harsh
strong
domineering
old
woman
then
nervously
expectant
they
begged
the
family
solicitor
to
disclose
her
will
written
with
her
own
hand
and
witnessed
by
two
servants
it
was
in
these
terms
i
elizabeth
ann
dwarris
of
old
queen
street
westminster
spinster
hereby
revoke
all
former
wills
and
testamentary
dispositions

and
declare
this
to
be
my
last
will
and
testament

ley
of

chelsea

my
will
and
i

and
personal

and
remote

give
my
blessing
and
i
beseech
them
to
bear
in
mind
the
example
and
advice
which
for
many
years
i
have
given
them
i
recommend
them
to
cultivate
in
future
strength
of
character
and
an
independent
spirit
i
venture
to
remind
them
that
the
humble
will
never
inherit
this
earth
for
their
reward
is
to
be
awaited
in
the
life
to
come
and
i
desire
them
to
continue
the
subscriptions
which
at
my
request
they
have
so
long
and
generously
made
to
the
society
for
the
conversion
of
the
jews
and
to
the
additional
curates
fund
in
witness
whereof
i
have
set
my
hand
to
this
my
will
the
day
of
april
elizabeth
ann
to
her
amazement
miss
ley
found
herself
at
the
age
of
in
possession
of
nearly
three
thousand
pounds
a
year
the
lease
of
a
pleasant
old
house
in
westminster
and
a
great
quantity
of
early
victorian
furniture
the
will
was
written
two
days
after
her
quarrel
with
the
eccentric
old
woman
and
the
terms
of
it
certainly
achieved
the
three
purposes
for
which
it
was
designed
it
occasioned
the
utmost
surprise
to
all
concerned
it
heaped
coals
of
fire
on
miss
ley
s
indifferent
head
and
caused
the
bitterest
disappointment
and
vexation
to
all
that
bore
the
name
of
dwarris
part
ii
the
chapter
i
miss
ley
returned
to
england
at
the
end
of
february
unlike
the
most
of
her
compatriots
she
did
not
go
abroad
to
see
the
friends
with
whom
she
spent
much
time
at
home
and
though
bella
and
herbert
field
were
at
naples
murray
in
rome
she
took
care
systematically
to
avoid
them
rather
was
it
her
practice
to
cultivate
chance
acquaintance
for
she
thought
the
english
in
foreign
lands
betrayed
their
idiosyncrasies
with
a
pleasant
and
edifying
frankness
in
venice
for
example
or
at
capri
the
delectable
isle
romance
might
be
seized
as
it
were
in
the
act
and
all
manner
of
oddities
were
displayed
with
a
most
diverting
effrontery
in
those
places
you
meet
pairs
uncertainly
related
whose
vehement
adventures
startled
the
decorum
of
a
previous
generation
you
discover
how
queer
may
be
the
most
conventional
how
ordinary
the
most
eccentric
miss
ley
with
her
discreet
knack
for
extracting
confidence
after
her
own
staid
fashion
enjoyed
herself
immensely
she
listened
to
the
strange
confessions
of
men
who
for
their
souls
sake
had
abandoned
the
greatness
of
the
world
and
now
spoke
of
their
past
zeal
with
indulgent
irony
of
women
who
for
love
had
been
willing
to
break
down
the
very
pillars
of
heaven
and
now
shrugged
their
shoulders
in
amused
recollection
of
passion
long
since
dead
well
what
have
you
fresh
to
tell
me
asked
frank
having
met
miss
ley
at
victoria
when
he
sat
down
to
dinner
in
old
queen
street
nothing
much
but
i
ve
noticed
that
when
pleasure
has
exhausted
a
man
he
s
convinced
that
he
has
exhausted
pleasure
then
he
tells
you
gravely
that
nothing
can
satisfy
the
human
but
frank
had
more
important
news
than
this
for
jenny
a
week
before
was
delivered
of
a
child
and
had
been
so
ill
that
it
was
thought
she
could
not
recover
now
however
the
worst
was
over
and
if
nothing
untoward
befell
she
might
be
expected
slowly
to
regain
health
how
does
basil
take
it
asked
miss
ley
he
says
very
little
he
s
grown
silent
of
late
but
i
m
afraid
he
s
quite
you
know
how
enormously
he
looked
forward
to
the
d
you
think
he
s
fond
of
his
wife
he
s
very
kind
to
her
no
one
could
have
been
gentler
than
he
after
the
catastrophe
i
think
she
was
the
more
cut
up
of
the
two
you
see
she
looked
upon
it
as
the
reason
of
their
marriage
and
he
s
been
doing
his
best
to
comfort
i
must
go
down
and
see
them
and
now
tell
me
about
i
haven
t
set
eyes
on
her
for
miss
ley
observed
frank
with
deliberation
she
wondered
if
he
knew
of
the
affair
with
reggie
bassett
but
though
eager
to
discuss
it
would
not
risk
to
divulge
a
secret
in
point
of
fact
he
was
familiar
with
all
the
circumstances
but
it
amused
him
to
counterfeit
ignorance
that
he
might
see
how
miss
ley
guided
the
conversation
to
the
point
she
wanted
she
spoke
of
the
dean
of
tercanbury
of
bella
and
her
husband
then
as
though
by
chance
mentioned
reggie
but
the
twinkling
of
frank
s
eyes
told
her
that
he
was
laughing
at
her
stratagem
you
brute
she
cried
why
didn
t
you
tell
me
all
about
it
instead
of
letting
me
discover
the
thing
by
accident
my
sex
suggests
to
me
certain
elementary
notions
of
honour
miss
you
needn
t
add
priggishness
to
your
other
detestable
vices
how
did
you
know
they
were
carrying
on
in
this
way
the
amiable
youth
told
me
there
are
very
few
men
who
can
refrain
from
boasting
of
their
conquests
and
certainly
reggie
isn
t
one
of
you
don
t
know
hugh
kearon
do
you
he
s
had
affairs
all
over
europe
and
the
most
notorious
was
with
a
royal
princess
who
shall
be
nameless
i
think
she
would
have
bored
him
to
death
if
he
hadn
t
been
able
to
flourish
ostentatiously
a
handkerchief
with
a
royal
crown
in
the
corner
and
a
large
miss
ley
then
gave
her
account
of
the
visit
to
rochester
and
certainly
made
of
it
a
very
neat
and
entertaining
story
and
did
you
think
for
a
moment
that
this
would
be
the
end
of
the
business
asked
frank
ironically
don
t
be
spiteful
because
i
hoped
for
the
dear
miss
ley
the
bigger
blackguard
a
man
is
the
more
devoted
are
his
it
s
only
when
a
man
is
decent
and
treats
women
as
if
they
were
human
beings
that
he
has
a
rough
time
of
you
know
nothing
about
these
things
frank
retorted
miss
ley
pray
give
me
the
facts
and
the
philosophical
conclusions
i
can
draw
for
well
reggie
has
a
natural
aptitude
for
dealing
with
the
sex
i
heard
all
about
your
excursion
to
rochester
and
went
so
far
as
to
assure
him
that
you
wouldn
t
tell
his
mamma
he
perceived
that
he
hadn
t
cut
a
very
heroic
figure
so
he
mounted
the
high
horse
and
full
of
virtuous
indignation
for
a
month
took
no
notice
whatever
of
castillyon
then
she
wrote
most
humbly
begging
him
to
forgive
her
and
this
i
understand
he
graciously
did
he
came
to
see
me
flung
the
letter
on
the
table
and
said
there
my
boy
if
any
one
asks
you
say
that
what
i
don
t
know
about
women
ain
t
worth
two
days
later
he
appeared
with
a
gold
what
did
you
say
to
him
one
of
these
days
you
ll
come
the
very
devil
of
a
you
showed
wisdom
and
emphasis
i
hope
with
all
my
heart
he
i
don
t
imagine
things
are
going
very
smoothly
proceeded
frank
reggie
tells
me
she
leads
him
a
deuce
of
a
life
and
he
s
growing
restive
it
appears
to
be
no
joke
to
have
a
woman
desperately
in
love
with
you
and
then
he
s
never
been
on
such
familiar
terms
with
a
person
of
quality
and
he
s
shocked
by
her
vulgarity
her
behaviour
seems
often
to
outrage
his
sense
of
isn
t
that
like
an
englishman
he
cultivates
propriety
even
in
the
then
miss
ley
asked
frank
about
himself
but
they
had
corresponded
with
diligence
and
he
had
little
to
tell
the
work
at
saint
luke
s
went
on
monotonously
lectures
to
students
three
times
a
week
and
on
wednesday
and
saturday
people
were
beginning
to
come
to
his
in
harley
street
and
he
looked
forward
without
great
enthusiasm
to
the
future
of
a
fashionable
physician
and
are
you
in
love
you
know
i
shall
never
permit
my
affections
to
wander
so
long
as
you
remain
single
he
answered
laughing
beware
i
don
t
take
you
at
your
word
and
drag
you
by
the
hair
of
your
head
to
the
altar
have
i
no
rival
well
if
you
press
me
i
will
monster
what
is
her
name
good
heavens
it
s
a
parasite
i
m
studying
i
think
authorities
are
all
wrong
about
it
they
ve
not
got
its
right
and
the
stuff
they
believe
about
the
way
people
catch
it
is
sheer
it
doesn
t
sound
frightfully
thrilling
to
me
and
i
m
under
the
impression
you
re
only
trumping
it
up
to
conceal
some
scandalous
amour
with
a
miss
ley
s
visit
to
barnes
seemed
welcome
neither
to
jenny
nor
to
basil
who
looked
harassed
and
unhappy
and
only
with
a
visible
effort
assumed
a
cheerful
manner
when
he
addressed
his
wife
jenny
was
still
in
bed
very
weak
and
ill
but
miss
ley
who
had
never
before
seen
her
was
surprised
at
her
great
beauty
her
face
whiter
than
the
pillows
against
which
it
rested
had
a
very
touching
pathos
and
notwithstanding
all
that
had
gone
before
that
winsome
innocent
sweetness
which
has
occasioned
the
comparison
of
english
maidens
to
the
english
rose
the
observant
woman
noticed
also
the
painful
questioning
anxiety
with
which
jenny
continually
glanced
at
her
husband
as
though
pitifully
dreading
some
unmerited
reproach
i
hope
you
like
my
wife
said
basil
when
he
accompanied
miss
ley
downstairs
poor
thing
she
seems
to
me
like
a
lovely
bird
imprisoned
by
fate
within
the
four
walls
of
practical
life
who
should
by
rights
sing
careless
songs
under
the
open
skies
i
m
afraid
you
ll
be
very
unkind
to
why
he
asked
not
without
resentment
my
dear
you
ll
make
her
live
up
to
your
blue
china
teapot
the
world
might
be
so
much
happier
if
people
wouldn
t
insist
on
acting
up
to
their
bush
had
been
hurriedly
sent
for
when
jenny
s
condition
seemed
dangerous
but
in
her
distress
and
excitement
she
had
sought
solace
in
basil
s
to
such
an
extent
that
he
was
obliged
to
beg
her
to
return
to
her
own
home
the
scene
was
not
edifying
surmising
an
alcoholic
tendency
kent
two
or
three
days
after
her
arrival
locked
the
and
removed
the
key
but
in
a
little
while
the
servant
came
to
him
if
you
please
sir
bush
says
can
she
ave
the
whiskey
she
s
not
feelin
very
i
ll
go
to
bush
sat
in
the
with
folded
hands
doing
her
utmost
to
express
on
a
healthy
countenance
maternal
anxiety
indisposition
and
ruffled
dignity
she
was
not
vastly
pleased
to
see
her
instead
of
the
expected
maid
oh
is
that
you
basil
she
said
i
can
t
find
the
sideboard
key
anywhere
and
i
m
that
upset
i
must
ave
a
little
drop
of
i
wouldn
t
if
i
were
you
bush
you
re
much
better
without
oh
indeed
she
answered
bristling
p
raps
you
know
more
about
me
inside
feelings
than
i
do
myself
i
ll
just
trouble
you
to
give
me
the
key
young
man
and
look
sharp
about
it
i
m
not
a
woman
to
be
put
upon
by
any
one
and
i
tell
you
i
m
very
sorry
but
i
think
you
ve
had
quite
enough
to
drink
jenny
may
want
you
and
you
would
be
wise
to
keep
d
you
mean
to
insinuate
that
i
ve
ad
more
than
i
can
carry
i
wouldn
t
go
quite
so
far
as
that
he
answered
smiling
thank
you
for
nothing
cried
bush
indignantly
and
i
should
be
obliged
if
you
wouldn
t
laugh
at
me
and
i
must
say
it
s
very
eartless
with
me
daughter
lying
ill
in
her
bedroom
i
m
very
much
upset
and
i
did
think
you
d
treat
me
like
a
lady
but
you
never
ave
kent
no
not
even
the
first
time
i
come
here
oh
i
aven
t
forgot
so
don
t
you
think
i
ave
a
sixpenny
alfpenny
teapot
was
good
enough
for
me
but
when
your
come
in
out
pops
the
silver
and
i
don
t
believe
for
a
moment
it
s
real
silver
blood
s
all
very
well
kent
but
what
i
say
is
give
me
manners
you
re
a
nice
young
feller
you
are
to
grudge
me
a
little
drop
of
spirits
when
me
poor
daughter
s
on
her
i
wouldn
t
stay
another
minute
in
this
ouse
if
it
wasn
t
for
i
was
going
to
suggest
it
would
be
better
if
you
returned
to
your
happy
home
in
crouch
end
answered
basil
when
the
good
woman
stopped
to
take
breath
were
you
indeed
well
we
ll
just
see
what
jenny
as
to
say
to
that
i
suppose
my
daughter
is
mistress
in
er
own
bush
started
to
her
feet
and
made
for
the
door
but
basil
stood
with
his
back
against
it
i
can
t
allow
you
to
go
to
her
now
i
don
t
think
you
re
in
a
fit
d
you
think
i
m
going
to
let
you
prevent
me
get
out
of
my
way
young
basil
more
disgusted
than
out
of
temper
looked
at
the
angry
creature
with
a
cold
scorn
which
was
not
easy
to
stomach
i
m
sorry
to
hurt
your
feelings
bush
but
i
think
you
d
better
leave
this
house
at
once
fanny
will
put
your
things
together
i
m
going
to
jenny
s
room
and
i
forbid
you
to
come
to
it
i
expect
you
to
be
gone
in
half
an
he
turned
on
his
heel
leaving
bush
furious
but
intimidated
she
was
so
used
to
have
her
own
way
that
opposition
took
her
aback
and
basil
s
manner
did
not
suggest
that
he
would
easily
suffer
contradiction
but
she
made
up
her
mind
whatever
the
consequences
to
force
her
way
into
jenny
s
room
and
there
set
out
her
grievance
she
had
not
done
repeating
to
herself
what
she
would
say
when
the
servant
entered
to
state
that
according
to
her
master
s
order
she
had
packed
bush
s
things
jenny
s
mother
started
up
indignantly
but
pride
forbade
her
to
let
the
maid
see
she
was
turned
out
quite
right
fanny
this
isn
t
the
ouse
that
a
lady
would
stay
in
and
i
pity
you
my
dear
for
aving
a
master
like
my
you
can
tell
im
with
my
compliments
thate
s
no
jenny
who
was
asleep
woke
at
the
slamming
of
the
what
s
that
she
asked
your
mother
has
gone
away
dearest
d
you
mind
she
looked
at
him
quickly
divining
from
knowledge
of
her
parent
s
character
that
some
quarrel
had
occurred
and
anxious
to
see
that
basil
was
not
annoyed
she
gave
him
her
hand
no
i
m
glad
i
want
to
be
alone
with
you
i
don
t
want
any
one
to
come
between
he
bent
down
and
kissed
her
and
she
put
her
arms
round
his
neck
you
re
not
angry
with
me
because
the
baby
died
my
darling
how
could
i
be
say
that
you
don
t
regret
having
married
jenny
realising
by
now
that
basil
had
married
her
only
on
account
of
the
child
was
filled
with
abject
terror
his
interests
were
so
different
from
hers
and
she
had
but
gradually
come
to
understand
how
great
was
the
separation
between
them
that
the
son
alone
seemed
able
to
preserve
to
her
basil
s
affection
it
was
the
mother
he
loved
and
now
he
might
bitterly
repent
his
haste
for
it
seemed
she
had
forced
marriage
upon
him
by
false
pretenses
the
chief
tie
that
bound
them
was
severed
and
though
with
meek
gratitude
accepting
the
attentions
suggested
by
his
kindness
she
asked
herself
with
aching
heart
what
would
happen
on
her
recovery
time
passed
and
jenny
though
ever
pale
and
listless
grew
strong
enough
to
leave
her
room
it
was
proposed
that
in
a
little
while
she
should
go
with
her
sister
for
a
month
to
brighton
basil
s
work
prevented
him
from
leaving
london
for
long
but
he
promised
to
run
down
for
the
one
afternoon
he
came
home
in
high
spirits
having
just
received
from
his
publishers
a
letter
to
say
that
his
book
had
found
favour
and
would
be
issued
in
the
coming
spring
it
seemed
the
first
step
to
the
renown
he
sought
he
found
james
bush
his
seated
with
jenny
and
in
his
elation
greeted
him
with
unusual
cordiality
but
james
lacked
his
usual
facetious
flow
of
conversation
and
wore
indeed
a
air
which
at
another
time
would
have
excited
basil
s
attention
he
took
his
leave
at
once
and
then
basil
noticed
that
jenny
was
much
disturbed
though
he
knew
nothing
for
certain
he
had
an
idea
that
the
family
of
bush
came
to
his
wife
when
they
were
in
financial
straits
but
from
the
beginning
had
decided
that
such
inevitable
claims
must
be
satisfied
he
preferred
however
to
ignore
the
help
which
jenny
gave
and
when
she
asked
for
some
small
sum
beyond
her
allowance
handed
it
without
question
why
was
jimmie
here
at
this
hour
he
asked
carelessly
thinking
him
bound
on
some
such
errand
i
thought
he
didn
t
leave
his
office
till
oh
basil
something
awful
has
happened
i
don
t
know
how
to
tell
you
he
s
i
hope
he
doesn
t
want
us
to
keep
him
answered
basil
coldly
i
m
very
hard
up
this
year
and
all
the
money
i
have
i
want
for
jenny
braced
herself
for
a
painful
effort
she
looked
away
and
her
voice
trembled
i
don
t
know
what
s
to
be
done
he
s
got
into
trouble
unless
he
can
find
a
hundred
and
fifteen
pounds
in
a
week
his
firm
are
going
to
what
on
earth
d
you
mean
jenny
oh
basil
don
t
be
angry
i
was
so
ashamed
to
tell
you
i
ve
been
hiding
it
for
a
month
but
now
i
can
t
any
more
something
went
wrong
with
his
d
you
mean
to
say
he
s
been
stealing
asked
basil
sternly
and
a
feeling
of
utter
horror
and
disgust
came
over
him
for
god
s
sake
don
t
look
at
me
like
that
she
cried
for
his
eyes
his
mouth
made
her
feel
a
culprit
confessing
on
her
own
account
some
despicable
crime
he
didn
t
mean
to
be
dishonest
i
don
t
exactly
understand
but
he
can
tell
you
how
it
all
was
oh
basil
you
won
t
let
him
be
sent
to
prison
couldn
t
he
have
the
money
instead
of
my
going
away
basil
sat
down
at
his
desk
to
think
out
the
matter
and
resting
his
face
thoughtfully
on
his
hands
sought
to
avoid
jenny
s
fixed
appealing
gaze
he
did
not
want
her
to
see
the
consternation
the
abject
shame
with
which
her
news
oppressed
him
but
all
the
same
she
saw
what
are
you
thinking
about
basil
nothing
particular
i
was
wondering
how
to
raise
the
you
don
t
think
because
he
s
my
brother
i
must
be
tarred
with
the
same
brush
he
looked
at
her
without
answering
it
was
certainly
unfortunate
that
his
wife
s
mother
should
drink
more
than
was
seemly
and
her
brother
have
but
primitive
ideas
about
property
it
s
not
my
fault
she
cried
with
bitter
pain
interrupting
his
silence
don
t
think
too
hardly
of
no
it
s
not
your
fault
he
answered
with
involuntary
coldness
you
must
go
away
to
brighton
all
the
same
but
i
m
afraid
it
means
no
holiday
in
the
he
wrote
a
cheque
and
then
a
letter
to
his
bank
begging
them
to
advance
a
hundred
pounds
on
securities
they
held
there
he
is
cried
jenny
hearing
a
ring
i
told
him
to
come
back
in
half
an
basil
got
up
you
d
better
give
the
cheque
to
your
brother
at
once
say
that
i
don
t
wish
to
see
isn
t
he
to
come
here
any
more
basil
that
is
as
you
like
jenny
if
you
wish
we
ll
pretend
he
was
unfortunate
rather
than
dishonest
but
i
d
rather
he
didn
t
refer
to
the
matter
i
want
neither
his
thanks
nor
his
without
answering
jenny
took
the
cheque
she
would
have
given
a
great
deal
to
fling
her
arms
gratefully
round
basil
s
neck
begging
him
to
forgive
but
there
was
a
hardness
in
his
manner
which
frightened
her
all
the
evening
he
sat
in
moody
silence
and
jenny
dare
not
speak
his
kiss
when
he
bade
her
had
never
been
so
frigid
and
unable
to
sleep
she
cried
bitterly
she
could
not
understand
the
profound
abhorrence
with
which
he
looked
upon
the
incident
to
her
mind
it
was
little
more
than
a
mischance
occasioned
by
jimmie
s
excessive
sharpness
and
she
was
disposed
to
agree
with
her
brother
that
only
luck
had
been
against
him
she
somewhat
resented
basil
s
refusal
to
hear
any
defence
and
his
complete
certainty
that
the
very
worst
must
be
true
a
few
days
later
coming
unexpectedly
kent
found
jenny
in
earnest
conversation
with
her
brother
who
had
quite
regained
his
jaunty
air
and
betrayed
no
false
shame
at
basil
s
knowledge
of
his
escapade
well
met
oratio
he
cried
holding
out
his
hand
i
just
come
in
on
the
chance
of
seeing
you
i
wanted
to
thank
you
for
that
i
d
rather
you
didn
t
speak
of
why
there
s
nothing
to
be
ashamed
of
i
ad
a
bit
of
bad
luck
that
s
all
i
ll
pay
you
back
you
know
you
needn
t
fear
about
he
gave
a
voluble
account
of
the
affair
proving
how
misfortune
may
befall
the
deserving
and
what
a
criminal
complexion
the
most
innocent
acts
may
wear
basil
against
his
will
admiring
the
fellow
s
jocose
effrontery
listened
with
chilling
silence
you
need
not
excuse
yourself
he
said
at
length
my
reasons
for
helping
you
were
purely
selfish
except
for
jenny
it
would
have
been
a
matter
of
complete
indifference
to
me
if
you
had
been
sent
to
prison
or
oh
that
was
all
kid
they
wouldn
t
have
prosecuted
don
t
i
tell
you
they
had
no
case
you
believe
me
don
t
you
no
i
don
what
d
you
mean
by
that
asked
james
angrily
we
won
t
discuss
the
other
did
not
answer
but
shot
at
basil
a
glance
of
singular
malevolence
you
can
whistle
for
your
money
young
feller
he
muttered
under
his
breath
you
won
t
get
much
out
of
he
had
but
small
intention
of
paying
back
the
rather
large
sum
but
now
abandoned
even
that
during
the
six
months
since
jenny
s
marriage
he
had
never
been
able
to
surmount
the
freezing
politeness
with
which
basil
used
him
he
hated
him
for
his
supercilious
air
but
needing
his
help
took
care
though
sometimes
he
could
scarcely
keep
his
temper
to
preserve
a
familiar
cordiality
he
knew
his
would
welcome
an
opportunity
to
forbid
him
the
house
and
this
especially
now
that
he
was
out
of
work
he
determined
to
avoid
he
stomached
the
affront
as
best
he
could
but
solaced
his
pride
with
the
determination
sooner
or
later
to
revenge
himself
well
so
long
he
cried
with
undiminished
serenity
i
ll
be
jenny
watched
this
scene
with
some
alarm
but
with
more
irritation
since
basil
s
frigid
contempt
for
her
brother
seemed
a
reflection
on
himself
you
might
at
least
be
polite
to
him
she
said
when
jimmie
was
gone
i
m
afraid
i
ve
pretty
well
used
up
all
my
after
all
he
is
my
that
is
a
fact
i
deplore
with
all
my
heart
he
answered
you
needn
t
be
so
hard
on
him
now
he
s
down
he
s
no
worse
than
plenty
basil
turned
to
her
with
flaming
eyes
good
god
don
t
you
realise
the
man
s
a
thief
doesn
t
it
mean
anything
to
you
that
he
s
dishonest
don
t
you
see
how
awful
it
is
that
a
man
he
broke
off
with
a
gesture
of
disgust
it
was
the
first
quarrel
they
ever
had
and
a
shrewish
look
came
to
jenny
s
face
her
pallor
gave
way
to
an
angry
flush
but
quickly
basil
recovered
himself
recollecting
his
wife
s
illness
and
her
bitter
disappointment
at
the
poor
babe
s
death
he
keenly
regretted
the
outburst
i
beg
your
pardon
jenny
i
didn
t
mean
to
say
that
i
should
have
remembered
you
were
fond
of
but
since
she
did
not
answer
looking
away
somewhat
sulkily
he
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
her
chair
and
stroked
her
wonderful
rich
tresses
don
t
be
cross
darling
we
won
t
quarrel
will
we
unable
to
resist
his
tenderness
tears
came
to
her
eyes
and
passionately
she
kissed
his
caressing
hands
no
no
she
cried
i
love
you
too
much
don
t
ever
speak
angrily
to
me
it
hurts
so
the
momentary
cloud
passed
and
they
spoke
of
the
approaching
visit
to
brighton
jenny
was
to
take
lodgings
and
she
made
him
promise
faithfully
that
he
would
come
every
saturday
frank
had
offered
a
room
in
harley
street
and
while
she
was
away
basil
meant
to
stay
with
him
you
won
t
forget
me
basil
of
course
not
but
you
must
hurry
up
and
get
well
and
come
when
at
length
she
set
off
and
basil
found
himself
frank
s
guest
he
could
not
suppress
a
slight
sigh
of
relief
it
was
very
delightful
to
live
again
in
a
bachelor
s
rooms
and
he
loved
the
smell
of
smoke
the
untidy
litter
of
books
the
lack
of
responsibility
there
was
no
need
to
do
anything
he
did
not
like
and
for
the
first
time
since
his
marriage
he
felt
entirely
comfortable
recalling
his
pleasant
rooms
in
the
temple
and
there
was
about
them
an
air
which
amiably
fitted
his
humour
he
thought
of
the
long
conversations
of
those
days
the
hours
of
reverie
the
undisturbed
ease
with
which
he
could
read
books
and
he
shuddered
at
the
pokey
villa
which
was
now
his
home
the
worries
of
housekeeping
and
the
want
of
privacy
he
had
meant
his
life
to
be
so
beautiful
and
it
was
merely
sordid
there
are
advantages
in
single
blessedness
laughed
the
doctor
when
he
saw
basil
after
breakfast
light
his
pipe
and
putting
his
feet
on
the
lean
back
with
a
sigh
of
content
but
he
regretted
his
words
when
he
saw
on
the
other
s
mobile
face
a
look
of
singular
wistfulness
it
was
his
first
indication
that
things
were
not
going
very
well
with
the
young
couple
by
the
way
frank
suggested
presently
would
you
care
to
come
to
a
party
lady
edward
stringer
is
giving
some
sort
of
function
and
there
ll
be
a
lot
of
people
you
i
ve
been
nowhere
since
my
marriage
basil
answered
irresolutely
i
shall
be
seeing
the
old
thing
shall
i
ask
if
i
can
bring
you
it
would
be
awfully
good
of
you
by
jove
i
should
enjoy
he
gave
a
laugh
i
ve
not
had
evening
clothes
on
for
six
chapter
ii
six
months
went
by
and
again
the
gracious
airs
of
summer
blew
into
miss
ley
s
in
old
queen
street
she
sat
at
luncheon
with
castillyon
wonderfully
rejuvenated
by
a
winter
in
the
east
for
paul
characteristically
anxious
to
combine
with
pleasure
had
suggested
that
they
should
mark
their
reconciliation
by
a
journey
to
india
where
they
might
enjoy
a
second
pleasanter
honeymoon
and
he
at
the
same
time
study
various
questions
which
would
be
to
him
of
much
political
value
castillyon
in
a
summer
frock
had
all
her
old
daintiness
of
a
figurine
in
dresden
china
and
her
former
vivacity
was
more
charming
by
reason
of
an
added
tenderness
she
emphasised
her
change
of
mind
by
allowing
her
hair
to
regain
its
natural
colour
d
you
like
it
mary
she
asked
paul
says
it
makes
me
look
ten
years
younger
and
i
ve
stopped
slapping
entirely
asked
miss
ley
with
a
smile
of
course
i
powder
a
little
but
that
doesn
t
count
and
you
know
i
never
use
a
puff
now
only
a
leather
you
can
t
think
how
we
enjoyed
ourselves
in
india
and
paul
s
a
perfect
duck
he
s
been
quite
awfully
good
to
me
i
m
simply
devoted
to
him
and
i
think
we
shall
get
a
baronetcy
at
the
next
birthday
the
reward
of
castillyon
coloured
and
laughed
you
know
i
m
afraid
i
shall
become
a
most
awful
prig
but
the
fact
is
it
s
so
comfortable
to
be
good
and
to
have
nothing
to
reproach
one
s
self
with
now
tell
me
about
every
one
where
did
you
pass
the
winter
i
went
to
italy
as
usual
and
my
cousin
algernon
with
his
daughter
spent
a
month
with
me
at
was
she
awfully
cut
up
at
the
death
of
her
husband
there
was
really
a
note
of
genuine
sympathy
in
castillyon
s
voice
so
that
miss
ley
realised
how
sincere
was
the
change
in
her
she
bore
it
very
wonderfully
and
i
think
she
s
curiously
happy
she
tells
me
that
she
feels
constantly
the
presence
of
miss
ley
paused
bella
has
collected
her
husband
s
verses
and
wishes
to
publish
them
and
she
s
written
a
very
touching
account
of
his
life
and
death
by
way
of
are
they
any
good
no
that
s
just
the
tragedy
of
the
whole
thing
i
never
knew
a
man
whose
nature
was
so
entirely
poetical
and
yet
he
never
wrote
a
line
which
is
other
than
mediocre
if
he
d
only
written
his
own
feelings
his
little
hopes
and
disappointments
he
might
have
done
something
good
but
he
s
only
produced
pale
imitations
of
swinburne
and
tennyson
and
shelley
i
can
t
understand
how
herbert
field
who
was
so
simple
and
upright
should
never
have
turned
out
a
single
stanza
which
wasn
t
stilted
and
forced
i
think
in
his
heart
he
felt
that
he
hadn
t
the
gift
of
literary
expression
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
high
ideals
personal
sincerity
or
the
seven
deadly
virtues
for
he
was
not
sorry
to
die
he
only
lived
to
be
a
great
poet
and
before
the
end
realised
that
he
would
never
have
become
miss
ley
saw
already
the
pretty
little
book
which
bella
would
publish
at
her
own
expense
the
neat
type
and
wide
margin
the
dainty
binding
she
saw
the
scornful
neglect
of
reviewers
and
the
pile
of
copies
which
eventually
bella
would
take
back
and
give
one
by
one
as
presents
to
her
friends
who
would
thank
her
warmly
but
never
trouble
to
read
ten
lines
and
what
has
happened
to
reggie
bassett
asked
grace
suddenly
miss
ley
gave
her
a
quick
glance
but
the
steadiness
of
castillyon
s
eyes
told
her
that
she
asked
the
question
indifferently
perhaps
to
show
how
entirely
her
infatuation
was
overcome
you
heard
that
he
married
i
saw
it
in
the
his
mother
was
very
indignant
and
for
three
months
refused
to
speak
to
him
but
at
last
i
was
able
to
tell
her
that
an
heir
was
expected
so
she
made
up
her
mind
to
swallow
her
pride
and
became
reconciled
with
her
who
is
a
very
nice
sensible
pretty
asked
grace
not
at
all
but
eminently
capable
already
she
has
made
reggie
into
quite
a
decent
member
of
society
bassett
has
now
gone
down
to
bournemouth
where
the
young
folks
have
taken
a
house
to
be
at
hand
when
the
baby
it
s
reassuring
to
think
that
the
ancient
race
of
the
will
not
be
extinguished
murmured
grace
ironically
i
gathered
that
your
young
friend
was
settling
down
because
one
day
he
returned
every
penny
i
had
lent
and
what
did
you
do
with
it
asked
miss
ley
grace
flushed
and
smiled
whimsically
well
it
happened
to
reach
me
just
before
our
so
i
spent
it
all
in
a
gorgeous
pearl
pin
for
paul
he
was
simply
castillyon
got
up
and
when
she
was
gone
miss
ley
took
a
letter
that
had
come
before
luncheon
but
which
her
guest
s
arrival
had
prevented
her
from
opening
it
was
from
basil
who
had
spent
the
whole
winter
on
miss
ley
s
recommendation
in
seville
she
opened
it
curiously
for
it
was
the
first
time
he
had
written
to
her
since
after
the
inquest
he
left
england
dear
miss
don
t
think
me
ungrateful
if
i
have
left
you
without
news
of
me
but
at
first
i
felt
i
could
not
write
to
people
in
england
whenever
i
thought
of
them
everything
came
back
and
it
was
only
by
a
desperate
effort
that
i
could
forget
for
some
time
it
seemed
to
me
that
i
could
never
face
the
world
again
and
i
was
tormented
by
i
vowed
to
give
up
my
whole
life
to
the
expression
of
my
deep
regret
and
fancied
i
could
never
again
have
a
peaceful
moment
or
anything
approaching
happiness
but
presently
i
was
ashamed
to
find
that
i
began
to
regain
my
old
temper
i
caught
myself
at
times
laughing
contentedly
amused
and
full
of
spirits
and
i
upbraided
myself
bitterly
because
only
a
few
weeks
after
the
poor
girl
s
death
i
could
actually
be
entertained
by
trivial
things
and
then
i
don
t
know
what
came
over
me
for
i
could
not
help
the
thought
that
my
prison
door
was
opened
though
i
called
myself
brutal
and
callous
deep
down
in
my
soul
arose
the
idea
that
the
fates
had
given
me
another
chance
the
slate
was
wiped
clean
and
i
could
start
fresh
i
pretended
even
to
myself
that
i
wanted
to
die
but
it
was
sheer
hypocrisy
i
wanted
to
live
and
to
take
life
by
both
hands
and
enjoy
it
i
have
such
a
desire
for
happiness
such
an
eager
yearning
for
life
in
its
fulness
and
glory
i
made
a
ghastly
mistake
and
i
suffered
for
it
heaven
knows
how
terribly
i
suffered
and
how
hard
i
tried
to
make
the
best
of
it
and
perhaps
it
wasn
t
all
my
fault
even
to
you
i
feel
ashamed
of
saying
this
i
ought
to
go
on
posing
decently
to
the
end
in
this
world
we
re
made
to
act
and
think
things
because
others
have
thought
them
good
we
never
have
a
chance
of
going
our
own
way
we
re
bound
down
by
the
prejudices
and
the
morals
of
all
and
sundry
for
god
s
sake
let
us
be
free
let
us
do
this
and
that
because
we
want
to
and
because
we
must
not
because
other
people
think
we
ought
and
d
you
know
the
worst
of
the
whole
thing
if
i
d
acted
like
a
blackguard
and
let
jenny
go
to
the
dogs
i
should
have
remained
happy
and
contented
and
prosperous
and
she
i
daresay
wouldn
t
have
died
it
s
because
i
tried
to
do
my
duty
that
all
this
misery
came
about
the
world
held
up
an
ideal
and
i
thought
they
meant
one
to
act
up
to
it
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
they
would
only
sneer
don
t
think
too
badly
of
me
because
i
say
these
things
they
have
come
to
me
here
and
it
was
you
who
sent
me
to
seville
you
must
have
known
what
effect
it
would
have
on
my
mind
tortured
and
sick
it
is
a
land
of
freedom
and
at
last
i
have
become
conscious
of
my
youth
how
can
i
forget
the
delight
of
wandering
in
the
sierpes
released
from
all
imprisoning
ties
watching
the
various
movements
as
though
it
were
a
yet
half
afraid
that
a
falling
curtain
would
bring
back
the
unendurable
reality
the
songs
the
dances
the
happy
idleness
of
by
the
guadalquivir
the
gay
turbulence
of
seville
by
night
i
could
not
long
resist
it
and
at
last
forgot
everything
but
that
time
was
short
and
the
world
was
to
the
living
by
the
time
you
get
this
letter
i
shall
be
on
my
way
home
yours
ever
basil
miss
ley
read
this
letter
with
a
smile
and
gave
a
little
sigh
i
suppose
at
that
age
one
can
afford
to
have
no
very
conspicuous
sense
of
humour
she
murmured
but
she
sent
basil
a
telegram
asking
him
to
stay
with
the
result
that
three
days
later
the
young
man
arrived
very
brown
after
his
winter
in
the
sunshine
healthy
and
than
ever
miss
ley
had
invited
frank
to
meet
him
at
dinner
and
the
pair
of
them
with
the
cold
unconcern
of
anatomists
observed
what
changes
the
intervening
time
had
wrought
on
the
impressionable
nature
basil
was
in
high
spirits
delighted
to
come
back
to
his
friends
but
a
discreet
soberness
underlying
his
vivacity
suggested
a
more
composed
temperament
what
he
had
gone
through
had
given
him
perhaps
a
solid
store
of
experience
on
which
he
could
rest
himself
he
was
less
emotional
and
more
mature
miss
ley
summed
up
her
impressions
next
time
she
was
alone
with
frank
every
englishman
has
a
churchwarden
shut
away
in
his
bosom
an
old
man
of
the
sea
whom
it
is
next
to
impossible
to
shake
off
sometimes
you
think
he
s
asleep
or
dead
but
he
s
wonderfully
tenacious
of
life
and
sooner
or
later
you
find
him
enthroned
in
full
possession
of
the
i
don
t
know
what
you
mean
by
the
word
interrupted
frank
but
if
you
do
pray
go
the
churchwarden
is
waking
up
in
basil
and
i
feel
sure
he
will
have
a
very
successful
career
but
i
shall
warn
him
not
to
let
that
ecclesiastical
functionary
get
the
upper
miss
ley
waited
for
basil
to
speak
of
murray
but
after
two
days
her
patience
was
exhausted
and
she
attacked
him
point
blank
at
the
mention
of
the
name
his
cheeks
flamed
i
daren
t
go
and
see
her
after
what
happened
i
can
never
see
her
again
i
am
steeling
myself
to
and
are
you
succeeding
she
asked
drily
no
no
i
shall
never
succeed
i
m
more
desperately
in
love
with
her
than
ever
i
was
but
i
couldn
t
marry
her
now
the
recollection
of
poor
jenny
would
be
continually
between
us
for
it
was
we
hilda
and
i
who
drove
her
to
her
don
t
be
a
melodramatic
idiot
answered
miss
ley
sharply
you
talk
like
the
persecuted
hero
of
a
penny
novelette
hilda
s
very
fond
of
you
and
she
has
the
feminine
common
sense
which
alone
counterbalances
in
the
world
the
romantic
folly
of
men
what
on
earth
do
you
imagine
is
the
use
of
making
yourselves
wretched
so
that
you
may
cut
a
picturesque
figure
i
should
have
thought
you
were
cured
of
heroics
you
wrote
and
told
me
that
the
world
was
for
the
living
an
idea
which
has
truth
rather
than
novelty
to
recommend
it
and
do
you
think
there
is
any
sense
in
posturing
absurdly
to
impress
an
inattentive
gallery
how
do
i
know
that
hilda
cares
for
me
still
she
may
hate
me
because
i
brought
on
her
shame
and
if
i
were
you
i
d
go
and
ask
her
laughed
miss
ley
and
go
with
good
heart
for
she
cared
for
you
for
your
physical
attractiveness
rather
than
for
your
character
and
that
i
may
tell
you
whatever
moralists
say
is
infinitely
more
reliable
since
you
may
easily
be
mistaken
in
a
person
s
character
but
his
good
looks
are
obvious
and
visible
you
re
handsomer
than
ever
you
when
basil
set
out
to
call
on
murray
miss
ley
amused
herself
with
conjecturing
ironically
the
scene
of
their
meeting
with
curling
lips
she
noted
in
her
mind
s
eye
the
embarrassed
handshake
the
trivial
conversation
the
disconcerting
silence
and
without
sympathy
imagined
the
gradual
warmth
and
the
passionate
declaration
that
followed
she
moralised
a
common
mistake
of
writers
is
to
make
their
characters
in
moments
of
great
emotion
express
themselves
with
good
taste
nothing
could
be
more
false
for
at
such
times
people
however
refined
use
precisely
the
terms
of
the
the
utterance
of
violent
passion
is
never
artistic
but
trite
ridiculous
and
grotesque
vulgar
often
and
miss
ley
smiled
probably
novelists
alone
make
love
in
a
truly
romantic
manner
but
then
it
s
ten
to
one
they
re
quoting
from
some
unpublished
work
or
are
listening
intently
to
themselves
in
admiration
of
their
glowing
and
polished
at
all
events
the
interview
between
hilda
and
basil
was
eminently
satisfactory
as
may
be
seen
by
the
following
letter
which
some
days
later
the
young
man
received
cher
it
is
with
the
greatest
surprise
and
delight
that
i
read
in
this
morning
s
of
your
engagement
to
murray
you
have
fallen
on
your
feet
and
i
congratulate
you
don
t
you
remember
that
becky
sharp
said
she
could
be
very
good
on
five
thousand
a
year
and
the
longer
i
live
the
more
convinced
i
am
that
this
is
a
with
a
house
in
charles
street
and
you
will
find
the
world
a
very
different
place
to
live
in
you
will
grow
more
human
dress
better
and
be
less
censorious
do
come
to
luncheon
and
bring
murray
there
will
be
a
few
people
and
i
hope
it
will
be
amusing
one
o
clock
i
m
afraid
it
s
an
extraordinary
hour
to
lunch
but
i
m
going
to
be
received
into
the
catholic
church
in
the
morning
and
we
er
all
coming
on
here
afterward
i
mean
to
assume
the
names
of
the
two
saints
whose
example
has
most
assisted
me
in
my
conversion
and
henceforth
shall
sign
myself
your
affectionate
mother
marguÃ©rite
elizabeth
claire
vizard
the
duke
of
olpherts
is
going
to
be
my
a
month
later
hilda
murray
and
basil
were
married
in
by
the
rev
collinson
farley
miss
ley
gave
away
the
bride
and
in
the
church
besides
were
only
the
verger
and
frank
hurrell
afterward
in
the
vestry
miss
ley
shook
the
vicar
s
hand
i
think
it
went
off
very
nicely
it
was
charming
of
you
to
offer
to
marry
the
bride
is
a
very
dear
friend
of
mine
i
was
anxious
to
give
her
this
proof
of
my
goodwill
at
the
beginning
of
her
new
he
paused
and
smiled
benignly
so
that
miss
ley
who
knew
something
of
his
old
attachment
to
hilda
wondered
at
his
good
spirits
she
had
never
seen
him
more
trim
and
imposing
he
looked
already
every
inch
a
bishop
shall
i
tell
you
a
great
secret
he
added
blandly
i
am
about
to
contract
an
alliance
with
florence
lady
newhaven
we
shall
be
married
at
the
end
of
the
my
dear
farley
i
congratulate
you
with
all
my
heart
i
see
already
these
shapely
calves
encased
in
the
gaiters
farley
smiled
pleasantly
for
he
made
a
practice
of
appreciating
the
jests
of
elderly
maiden
ladies
with
ample
means
and
he
could
boast
that
to
his
sense
of
humour
was
due
the
luxurious
appointing
of
his
church
for
no
place
of
worship
in
the
west
end
had
more
beautiful
handsomer
ornaments
nowhere
could
be
seen
smarter
hassocks
for
the
knees
of
the
devout
or
in
a
more
excellent
state
of
preservation
the
newly
married
couple
meant
to
spend
their
honeymoon
on
the
river
and
having
lunched
in
charles
street
started
immediately
i
m
thankful
they
don
t
want
us
to
see
them
off
at
paddington
said
frank
when
he
walked
with
miss
ley
toward
the
park
why
are
you
in
such
an
abominable
temper
she
asked
smiling
during
luncheon
i
was
twice
on
the
point
of
reminding
you
that
marriage
is
an
event
at
which
a
certain
degree
of
hilarity
is
not
frank
did
not
answer
and
now
they
turned
into
one
of
the
park
gates
in
that
gay
june
weather
the
place
was
crowded
though
the
hour
was
early
still
motors
tore
along
with
hurried
panting
carriages
passed
tranquil
and
dignified
the
london
throng
sat
about
idly
on
chairs
or
lounged
up
and
down
looking
at
their
neighbours
talking
of
the
topics
of
the
hour
frank
s
eyes
travelled
over
them
slowly
and
shuddering
a
little
his
brow
grew
strangely
dark
during
that
ceremony
and
afterward
i
could
think
of
nothing
but
jenny
it
s
only
eighteen
months
since
i
signed
my
name
for
basil
s
first
marriage
in
a
dingy
registry
office
you
don
t
know
how
beautiful
the
girl
was
on
that
day
full
of
love
and
gratitude
and
happiness
she
looked
forward
to
the
future
with
such
eager
longing
and
now
she
s
rotting
underground
and
the
woman
she
hated
and
the
man
she
adored
are
married
and
they
haven
t
a
thought
for
all
her
misery
i
hated
basil
in
his
new
frock
coat
and
hilda
murray
and
you
i
can
t
imagine
why
a
sensible
woman
like
you
should
overdress
ridiculously
for
such
a
miss
ley
conscious
of
the
entire
success
of
her
costume
could
afford
to
smile
at
this
i
have
observed
that
whenever
you
re
out
of
humour
with
yourself
you
insult
me
she
murmured
frank
went
on
his
face
hard
and
set
his
dark
eyes
glowering
fiercely
it
all
seemed
so
useless
it
seemed
that
the
wretched
girl
had
to
undergo
such
frightful
torture
merely
to
bring
these
two
commonplace
creatures
together
they
must
have
no
imagination
or
no
shame
how
could
they
marry
with
that
unhappy
death
between
them
for
after
all
it
was
they
who
killed
her
and
d
you
think
basil
is
grateful
because
jenny
gave
him
her
youth
and
her
love
her
wonderful
beauty
and
at
last
her
life
he
doesn
t
think
of
her
and
you
too
because
she
was
a
barmaid
are
convined
that
it
s
a
very
good
thing
she
s
out
of
the
way
the
only
excuse
i
can
see
for
them
is
that
they
re
blind
instruments
of
fate
nature
was
working
through
them
obscurely
working
to
join
them
together
for
her
own
purposes
and
because
jenny
came
between
she
crushed
her
i
can
find
a
better
excuse
for
them
than
that
answered
miss
ley
looking
gravely
at
frank
i
forgive
them
because
they
re
human
and
weak
the
longer
i
live
the
more
i
am
overwhelmed
by
the
utter
utter
weakness
of
men
they
do
try
to
do
their
duty
they
do
their
best
honestly
they
seek
straight
ways
but
they
re
dreadfully
weak
and
so
i
think
one
ought
to
be
sorry
for
them
and
make
all
possible
allowances
i
m
afraid
it
sounds
rather
idiotic
but
i
find
the
words
now
most
frequently
on
my
lips
are
forgive
them
for
they
know
not
what
they
they
walked
silently
and
after
a
while
frank
stopped
on
a
sudden
and
faced
miss
ley
he
pulled
out
his
watch
it
s
quite
early
yet
and
we
have
the
afternoon
before
us
will
you
come
with
me
to
the
cemetery
where
jenny
is
buried
why
not
let
the
dead
lie
let
us
think
of
life
rather
than
of
frank
shook
his
head
i
must
go
i
couldn
t
rest
otherwise
i
can
t
bear
that
on
this
day
she
should
be
entirely
very
well
i
will
come
with
they
turned
round
and
came
out
of
the
park
frank
hailed
a
cab
and
they
started
they
passed
the
pompous
mansions
of
the
great
sedate
and
magnificent
and
driving
north
traversed
long
streets
of
smaller
dwellings
dingy
and
gray
notwithstanding
the
brightness
of
the
sky
they
went
on
it
seemed
interminably
and
each
street
strangely
awfully
resembled
its
predecessor
they
came
to
roads
where
each
house
was
separate
and
had
its
garden
and
there
were
trees
and
flowers
they
were
the
habitations
of
merchants
and
and
had
a
trim
respectable
look
and
smug
but
these
they
left
behind
for
more
crowded
parts
and
now
it
seemed
a
different
london
more
vivacious
more
noisy
the
way
was
thronged
with
trams
and
buses
and
there
were
along
the
pavements
the
shops
were
gaudy
and
cheap
and
the
houses
mean
they
drove
through
slums
with
children
playing
merrily
on
the
curb
and
women
in
dirty
aprons
blousy
and
dishevelled
lounging
about
their
doorsteps
at
length
they
reached
a
broad
straight
road
white
and
dusty
and
unshaded
and
knew
their
destination
was
at
hand
for
occasionally
they
passed
a
shop
where
were
made
and
an
empty
hearse
trundled
by
the
mutes
huddled
on
the
box
laughing
loudly
smoking
after
the
fatigue
of
their
accustomed
work
the
cemetery
came
in
sight
and
they
stopped
at
iron
gates
and
walked
in
it
was
a
vast
place
crowded
with
every
imaginable
kind
of
funeral
ornament
which
glistened
white
and
cold
in
the
sun
it
was
hideous
vulgar
and
sordid
and
one
shuddered
to
think
of
the
rude
material
minds
of
those
who
could
bury
folk
they
loved
in
that
restless
ground
wherein
was
neither
peace
nor
silence
they
might
prate
of
the
soul
s
immortality
but
surely
in
their
hearts
they
looked
upon
the
dead
as
common
clay
or
they
would
never
have
borne
that
they
should
lie
till
the
day
of
judgment
in
that
unhallowed
spot
there
was
about
it
a
gross
businesslike
air
that
was
infinitely
depressing
frank
and
miss
ley
walked
through
passing
a
knot
of
persons
about
an
open
grave
where
a
curate
uttered
hastily
with
the
boredom
of
long
habit
the
most
solemn
words
that
man
has
ever
penned
that
is
born
of
a
woman
hath
but
a
short
time
to
live
and
is
full
of
misery
he
cometh
up
and
is
cut
down
like
a
flower
he
fleeth
as
it
were
a
shadow
and
never
continueth
in
one
miss
ley
pale
of
face
took
frank
s
arm
and
hurried
on
here
and
there
dead
flowers
were
piled
upon
new
graves
here
and
there
the
earth
was
but
freshly
turned
they
came
at
last
to
where
jenny
lay
an
oblong
stone
of
granite
whereon
was
cut
a
simple
cross
and
frank
gave
a
sudden
cry
for
it
was
covered
at
that
moment
so
that
only
the
cross
was
outlined
with
red
roses
for
a
while
they
stared
in
silence
amazed
they
re
quite
fresh
said
miss
ley
they
were
put
here
this
she
turned
to
frank
and
looked
at
him
slowly
you
said
they
d
forgotten
and
they
came
on
their
wedding
day
and
laid
roses
on
her
d
you
think
she
came
too
i
m
sure
of
it
ah
frank
i
think
one
should
forgive
them
a
good
deal
for
that
i
told
you
that
they
did
strive
to
do
right
and
if
they
fell
it
was
only
because
they
were
human
and
very
weak
don
t
you
think
it
s
better
for
us
to
be
charitable
i
wonder
if
we
should
have
surmounted
any
better
than
they
did
their
great
difficulties
and
their
great
frank
made
no
reply
and
for
a
long
time
they
contemplated
those
rich
red
roses
and
thought
of
hilda
s
tender
hands
laying
them
gently
on
the
poor
woman
s
cold
you
re
right
he
said
at
last
i
can
forgive
them
a
good
deal
because
they
had
this
thought
i
hope
they
will
be
very
i
think
it
s
a
good
she
laid
her
hand
on
frank
s
arm
and
now
let
us
go
away
for
we
are
living
and
the
dead
have
nothing
to
say
to
us
you
brought
me
here
and
now
i
want
to
take
you
on
farther
to
show
you
something
he
did
not
understand
but
followed
obediently
till
they
came
to
the
cab
miss
ley
told
the
driver
to
go
straight
on
away
from
london
till
she
bade
him
stop
and
then
leaving
behind
them
that
sad
place
of
death
they
came
suddenly
into
the
open
the
highway
had
the
pleasant
brown
hardness
of
a
country
road
and
it
was
bordered
by
a
hawthorn
hedge
green
fields
stretched
widely
on
either
side
and
they
might
have
been
a
hundred
miles
from
london
town
miss
ley
stopped
the
cab
and
told
the
man
to
wait
whilst
she
and
her
friend
walked
on
don
t
look
back
she
said
to
frank
only
look
forward
look
at
the
trees
and
the
the
sky
was
singularly
blue
and
the
dulcet
breeze
bore
gracious
savours
of
the
country
there
was
a
suave
limpidity
of
the
air
which
chased
away
all
ugly
thoughts
both
of
them
walking
quickly
breathed
with
wide
lungs
inspiring
eagerly
the
radiance
of
that
summer
afternoon
on
a
turn
of
the
road
miss
ley
gave
a
quick
cry
of
delight
for
she
saw
the
hedge
suddenly
ablaze
with
wild
roses
have
you
a
knife
she
said
do
cut
and
she
stood
while
he
gathered
a
great
bunch
of
the
simple
fresh
flowers
he
gave
them
to
her
and
she
held
them
with
both
hands
i
love
them
because
they
re
the
same
roses
as
grow
in
rome
from
the
sarcophagi
in
the
gardens
they
grow
out
of
those
old
coffins
to
show
us
that
life
always
triumphs
over
death
what
do
i
care
for
illness
and
old
age
and
disease
the
world
may
be
full
of
misery
and
disillusion
it
may
not
give
a
tithe
of
what
we
ask
it
may
offer
hatred
instead
of
love
disappointment
wretchedness
triviality
and
heaven
knows
what
but
there
is
one
thing
that
compensates
for
all
the
rest
that
takes
away
the
from
a
sordid
show
and
gives
it
a
meaning
a
solemnity
and
a
magnificence
which
make
it
worth
while
to
live
and
for
that
one
thing
all
we
suffer
is
richly
and
what
the
dickens
is
that
asked
frank
smiling
miss
ley
looked
at
him
with
laughing
eyes
holding
out
the
roses
her
cheeks
flushed
why
beauty
you
dolt
she
cried
gaily
