where
he
will
stop
peter
rabbit
had
just
seen
jimmy
skunk
disappear
inside
an
old
barrel
lying
on
its
side
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
at
once
the
imp
of
mischief
began
to
whisper
to
peter
of
course
peter
should
have
listened
certainly
not
but
he
did
you
know
peter
dearly
loves
a
joke
when
it
is
on
some
one
else
he
sat
right
where
he
was
and
watched
to
see
if
jimmy
would
come
out
of
the
barrel
jimmy
did
come
out
and
after
a
little
peter
stole
over
to
the
barrel
and
peeped
inside
there
was
jimmy
skunk
curled
up
for
a
nap
peter
tiptoed
away
very
softly
all
the
time
the
imp
of
mischief
was
whispering
to
him
that
this
was
a
splendid
chance
to
play
a
joke
on
jimmy
you
know
it
is
very
easy
to
play
a
joke
on
any
one
who
is
asleep
peter
does
often
have
a
chance
to
play
a
joke
on
jimmy
skunk
it
is
a
very
safe
thing
to
do
not
if
jimmy
is
awake
no
one
knows
that
better
than
peter
he
sat
down
some
distance
from
the
barrel
but
where
he
could
keep
an
eye
on
it
then
he
went
into
a
brown
study
which
is
one
way
of
saying
that
he
thought
very
hard
he
wanted
to
play
a
joke
on
jimmy
but
like
most
jokers
he
did
want
the
joke
to
come
back
on
himself
in
fact
he
felt
that
it
would
be
a
great
deal
better
for
him
if
jimmy
should
know
that
he
had
anything
to
do
with
the
joke
as
he
sat
there
in
a
brown
study
he
happened
to
glance
over
on
the
green
meadows
and
there
he
saw
something
red
he
looked
very
hard
and
in
a
minute
he
saw
that
it
was
reddy
fox
right
away
peter
nimble
wits
began
to
plan
how
he
could
use
reddy
fox
to
play
a
joke
on
jimmy
all
in
a
flash
an
idea
came
to
him
an
idea
that
made
him
laugh
right
out
you
see
the
imp
of
mischief
was
very
very
busy
whispering
to
peter
if
reddy
were
only
up
here
i
believe
i
could
do
it
and
it
would
be
a
joke
on
reddy
as
well
as
on
jimmy
thought
peter
and
laughed
right
out
again
what
are
you
laughing
at
asked
a
voice
it
was
the
voice
of
sammy
jay
right
away
a
plan
for
getting
reddy
up
there
flashed
into
peter
head
he
would
get
sammy
angry
and
that
would
make
sammy
scream
reddy
would
be
sure
to
come
up
there
to
see
what
sammy
jay
was
making
such
a
fuss
about
sammy
you
know
is
very
no
one
knows
this
better
than
peter
so
instead
of
replying
politely
to
sammy
as
he
should
have
done
peter
spoke
crossly
fly
away
sammy
fly
away
it
is
no
business
of
yours
what
i
am
laughing
at
said
he
right
away
sammy
quick
temper
flared
up
he
began
to
call
peter
names
and
peter
answered
back
this
angered
sammy
still
more
and
as
he
always
screams
when
he
is
angry
he
was
soon
making
such
a
racket
that
reddy
fox
down
on
the
green
meadows
could
help
but
hear
it
peter
saw
him
lift
his
head
to
listen
in
a
few
minutes
he
began
to
trot
that
way
he
was
coming
to
find
out
what
that
fuss
was
about
peter
knew
that
reddy
would
come
straight
up
there
that
is
reddy
way
he
would
steal
around
back
of
the
old
stone
wall
on
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
which
was
back
of
peter
and
would
try
to
see
what
was
going
on
without
being
seen
himself
as
soon
as
he
sees
me
he
will
think
that
at
last
he
has
a
chance
to
catch
me
thought
peter
i
shall
have
to
run
my
very
fastest
but
if
everything
goes
right
he
will
soon
forget
all
about
me
i
do
hope
that
the
noise
sammy
jay
is
making
will
not
waken
jimmy
skunk
and
bring
him
out
to
see
what
is
going
on
so
with
one
eye
on
the
barrel
where
jimmy
skunk
was
taking
a
nap
and
the
other
eye
on
the
old
stone
wall
behind
which
he
expected
reddy
fox
to
come
stealing
up
peter
waited
and
did
mind
in
the
least
the
names
that
sammy
jay
was
calling
him
ii
peter
makes
a
flying
jump
to
risk
your
life
unless
there
need
is
downright
foolishness
indeed
never
forget
that
never
do
such
a
crazy
thing
as
peter
rabbit
was
doing
what
was
he
doing
why
he
was
running
the
risk
of
being
caught
by
reddy
fox
all
for
the
sake
of
a
joke
did
you
ever
hear
of
anything
more
foolish
yet
peter
was
no
different
from
a
lot
of
people
who
every
day
risk
their
lives
in
the
most
careless
and
heedless
ways
just
to
save
a
few
minutes
of
time
or
for
some
other
equally
foolish
reason
the
fact
is
peter
did
stop
to
think
what
dreadful
thing
might
happen
if
his
plans
did
work
out
as
he
intended
he
did
once
think
of
little
peter
over
in
the
dear
old
and
how
she
would
feel
if
he
never
came
home
again
that
the
trouble
with
thoughtlessness
it
never
remembers
other
people
all
the
time
that
reddy
fox
was
creeping
along
behind
the
old
stone
wall
on
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
peter
knew
just
where
he
was
though
reddy
did
know
that
if
he
had
known
it
he
would
have
suspected
one
of
peter
tricks
he
peep
over
that
wall
and
just
as
soon
as
he
sees
me
he
will
feel
sure
that
this
time
he
will
catch
me
thought
peter
he
will
steal
along
to
that
place
where
the
wall
is
lowest
and
will
jump
over
it
right
there
i
must
be
ready
to
jump
the
very
second
he
does
it
all
happened
just
as
peter
had
expected
while
seeming
to
be
paying
no
attention
to
anything
but
to
sammy
jay
he
kept
his
eyes
on
that
low
place
in
the
old
wall
and
presently
he
saw
reddy
sharp
nose
as
reddy
peeped
over
to
make
sure
that
he
was
still
there
the
instant
that
sharp
nose
dropped
out
of
sight
peter
made
ready
to
run
for
his
life
a
second
later
reddy
leaped
over
the
wall
and
peter
was
off
as
hard
as
he
could
go
with
reddy
almost
at
his
heels
sammy
jay
who
had
been
so
busy
calling
peter
names
that
he
had
seen
reddy
at
all
forgot
all
about
his
quarrel
with
peter
go
it
peter
go
it
he
screamed
excitedly
that
was
just
like
sammy
peter
did
go
it
he
had
to
he
ran
with
all
his
might
reddy
grinned
as
he
saw
peter
start
towards
the
green
meadows
it
was
a
long
way
to
the
dear
old
and
reddy
did
have
any
doubt
at
all
that
he
would
catch
peter
before
he
got
there
he
watched
sharply
for
peter
to
dodge
and
try
to
get
back
to
the
old
stone
wall
he
did
mean
to
let
peter
do
that
but
peter
did
even
try
he
ran
straight
for
the
edge
of
the
hill
above
the
green
meadows
then
for
the
first
time
reddy
noticed
an
old
barrel
there
lying
on
its
side
i
wonder
if
he
thinks
he
can
hide
in
that
thought
reddy
and
grinned
again
for
he
remembered
that
he
had
passed
that
old
barrel
a
few
days
before
and
that
one
end
was
open
while
the
other
end
was
closed
if
he
tries
that
i
will
get
him
without
the
trouble
of
much
of
a
chase
thought
reddy
and
chuckled
ran
peter
reddy
right
at
his
heels
to
sammy
jay
it
looked
as
if
in
a
few
more
jumps
reddy
certainly
would
catch
peter
go
it
peter
oh
go
it
go
it
screamed
sammy
for
in
spite
of
his
quarrels
with
peter
he
did
want
to
see
him
come
to
any
real
harm
just
as
he
reached
the
old
barrel
reddy
was
so
close
to
him
that
peter
was
almost
sure
that
he
could
feel
reddy
breath
then
peter
made
a
splendid
flying
jump
right
over
the
old
barrel
and
kept
on
down
the
hill
as
fast
as
ever
he
could
straight
for
an
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
of
which
he
knew
when
he
reached
it
he
turned
to
see
what
was
happening
behind
him
for
he
knew
by
the
screaming
of
sammy
jay
and
by
other
sounds
that
a
great
deal
was
happening
in
fact
he
suspected
that
the
joke
which
he
had
planned
was
working
out
just
as
he
had
hoped
it
would
iii
what
happened
at
the
old
barrel
peter
rabbit
jump
over
the
old
barrel
on
the
edge
of
the
hill
was
unexpected
to
reddy
fox
in
fact
reddy
was
so
close
on
peter
heels
that
he
had
no
thought
of
anything
but
catching
peter
he
was
running
so
fast
that
when
peter
made
his
flying
jump
over
the
barrel
reddy
did
not
have
time
to
jump
too
and
he
ran
right
smack
bang
against
that
old
barrel
now
you
remember
that
that
barrel
was
right
on
the
edge
of
the
hill
when
reddy
ran
against
it
he
hit
it
so
hard
that
he
rolled
it
over
and
of
course
that
started
it
down
the
hill
you
know
a
barrel
is
a
very
rolly
sort
of
thing
and
once
it
has
started
down
a
hill
nothing
can
stop
it
it
was
just
so
this
time
reddy
fox
had
no
more
than
picked
himself
up
when
the
barrel
was
half
way
down
the
hill
and
going
faster
and
faster
it
bounced
along
over
the
ground
and
every
time
it
hit
a
little
hummock
it
seemed
to
jump
right
up
in
the
air
and
all
the
time
it
was
making
the
strangest
noises
reddy
quite
forgot
the
smarting
sore
places
where
he
had
bumped
into
the
barrel
he
simply
stood
and
stared
at
the
runaway
as
i
live
he
exclaimed
i
believe
there
was
some
one
in
that
old
barrel
there
was
you
remember
that
jimmy
skunk
had
curled
up
in
there
for
a
nap
now
jimmy
was
awake
very
much
awake
you
see
for
once
in
his
life
he
was
moving
fast
very
much
faster
than
ever
he
had
moved
before
since
he
was
born
and
it
was
at
all
comfortable
no
sir
it
was
at
all
a
comfortable
way
in
which
to
travel
he
went
over
and
over
so
fast
that
it
made
him
dizzy
first
he
was
right
side
up
and
then
wrong
side
up
so
fast
that
he
could
tell
which
side
up
he
was
and
every
time
that
old
barrel
jumped
when
it
went
over
a
hummock
jimmy
was
tossed
up
so
that
he
hit
whatever
part
of
the
barrel
happened
to
be
above
him
of
course
he
could
get
out
because
he
was
rolled
over
and
over
so
fast
that
he
did
have
a
chance
to
try
now
reddy
did
know
who
was
in
the
barrel
he
just
knew
by
the
sounds
that
some
one
was
so
he
started
down
the
hill
after
the
barrel
to
see
what
would
happen
when
it
stopped
all
the
time
peter
rabbit
was
dancing
about
in
the
greatest
excitement
but
taking
the
greatest
care
to
keep
close
to
that
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
so
as
to
pop
into
it
in
case
of
danger
he
saw
that
reddy
fox
had
quite
forgotten
all
about
him
in
his
curiosity
as
to
who
was
in
the
barrel
and
he
chuckled
as
he
thought
of
what
might
happen
when
the
barrel
stopped
rolling
and
reddy
found
out
sammy
jay
was
flying
overhead
screaming
enough
to
split
his
throat
altogether
it
was
quite
the
most
exciting
thing
peter
had
ever
seen
now
it
just
happened
that
old
man
coyote
had
started
to
cross
the
green
meadows
right
at
the
foot
of
the
hill
just
as
the
barrel
started
down
of
course
he
heard
the
noise
and
looked
up
to
see
what
it
meant
when
he
saw
that
barrel
rushing
right
down
at
him
it
frightened
him
so
that
he
just
gave
one
yelp
and
started
for
the
old
pasture
like
a
gray
streak
he
gave
peter
a
chance
to
see
just
how
fast
he
can
run
and
peter
made
up
his
mind
right
then
that
he
never
would
run
a
race
with
old
man
coyote
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
hill
was
a
big
stone
and
when
the
barrel
hit
this
the
hoops
broke
and
the
barrel
fell
all
apart
peter
decided
that
it
was
high
time
for
him
to
get
out
of
sight
so
he
dodged
into
the
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
and
lay
low
in
the
doorway
where
he
could
watch
he
saw
jimmy
skunk
lay
perfectly
still
and
a
great
fear
crept
into
his
heart
had
jimmy
been
killed
he
had
once
thought
of
what
might
happen
to
jimmy
when
he
planned
that
joke
but
presently
jimmy
began
to
wave
first
one
leg
and
then
another
as
if
to
make
sure
that
he
had
some
legs
left
then
slowly
he
rolled
over
and
got
on
to
his
feet
peter
breathed
a
sigh
of
relief
iv
jimmy
skunk
is
very
mad
indeed
when
jimmy
skunk
is
angry
then
every
one
watch
out
it
better
far
at
such
a
time
to
be
nowhere
about
jimmy
skunk
was
angry
this
time
and
no
mistake
he
was
just
plain
and
when
jimmy
skunk
feels
that
way
no
one
wants
to
be
very
near
him
you
know
he
is
one
of
the
very
little
fellows
in
the
world
ordinarily
he
minds
his
own
business
and
if
no
one
interferes
with
him
he
interferes
with
no
one
but
once
he
is
aroused
and
feels
that
he
has
been
treated
fairly
look
out
for
him
and
this
time
jimmy
was
mad
clear
through
as
he
got
to
his
feet
and
shook
himself
to
see
that
he
was
all
there
i
do
know
that
any
one
could
blame
him
to
be
wakened
from
a
comfortable
nap
by
being
rolled
over
and
over
and
shaken
nearly
to
death
as
jimmy
had
been
by
that
wild
ride
down
the
hill
in
the
old
barrel
was
enough
to
make
any
one
mad
so
he
really
is
not
to
be
blamed
for
feeling
as
he
did
now
jimmy
can
never
be
accused
of
being
stupid
he
knew
that
an
old
barrel
which
has
been
lying
in
one
place
for
a
long
time
does
move
of
its
own
accord
he
knew
that
that
barrel
could
possibly
have
started
off
down
the
hill
unless
some
one
had
made
it
start
and
he
did
have
a
doubt
in
the
world
that
whoever
had
done
it
had
known
that
he
was
inside
and
had
done
it
to
make
him
uncomfortable
so
just
as
soon
as
he
had
made
sure
that
he
was
really
alive
and
quite
whole
he
looked
about
to
see
who
could
have
played
such
a
trick
on
him
the
first
person
he
saw
was
reddy
fox
in
fact
reddy
was
right
close
at
hand
you
see
he
had
raced
down
the
hill
after
the
barrel
to
see
who
was
in
it
when
he
heard
the
strange
noises
coming
from
it
as
it
rolled
and
bounded
down
if
reddy
had
known
that
it
was
jimmy
skunk
he
would
have
been
quite
content
to
remain
at
the
top
of
the
hill
but
he
know
and
if
the
truth
be
known
he
had
hopes
that
it
might
prove
to
be
some
one
who
would
furnish
him
with
a
good
breakfast
so
quite
out
of
breath
with
running
reddy
arrived
at
the
place
where
the
old
barrel
had
broken
to
pieces
just
as
jimmy
got
to
his
feet
now
when
jimmy
skunk
is
angry
he
does
bite
and
he
does
scratch
you
know
old
mother
nature
has
provided
him
with
a
little
bag
of
perfume
which
jimmy
does
object
to
in
the
least
but
which
makes
most
people
want
to
hold
their
noses
and
run
he
never
uses
it
excepting
when
he
is
angry
or
in
danger
but
when
he
does
use
it
his
enemies
always
turn
tail
and
run
that
is
why
he
is
afraid
of
no
one
and
why
every
one
respects
jimmy
and
his
rights
he
used
it
now
and
he
did
waste
any
time
about
it
he
threw
some
of
that
perfume
right
in
the
face
of
reddy
fox
before
reddy
had
a
chance
to
turn
or
to
say
a
word
take
that
snapped
jimmy
skunk
perhaps
it
will
teach
you
not
to
play
tricks
on
your
honest
neighbors
poor
reddy
some
of
that
perfume
got
in
his
eyes
and
made
them
smart
dreadfully
in
fact
for
a
little
while
he
could
see
at
all
and
then
the
smell
of
it
was
so
strong
that
it
made
him
quite
sick
he
rolled
over
and
over
on
the
ground
choking
and
gasping
and
rubbing
his
eyes
jimmy
skunk
just
stood
and
looked
on
and
there
was
a
bit
of
pity
in
his
eyes
how
do
you
like
that
said
he
you
thought
yourself
very
smart
rolling
me
down
hill
in
a
barrel
did
you
you
might
have
broken
my
neck
i
did
know
you
were
in
that
barrel
and
i
did
mean
to
roll
it
down
the
hill
anyway
whined
reddy
when
he
could
get
his
voice
huh
snorted
jimmy
skunk
who
did
believe
a
word
of
it
i
did
honestly
i
did
protested
reddy
i
ran
against
the
barrel
by
accident
chasing
peter
rabbit
i
did
have
any
idea
that
any
one
was
in
it
huh
said
jimmy
skunk
again
if
you
were
chasing
peter
rabbit
where
is
he
now
reddy
had
to
confess
he
did
know
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
and
he
certainly
had
had
time
to
reach
the
dear
old
jimmy
looked
this
way
and
that
way
but
there
was
no
sign
of
peter
rabbit
huh
said
he
again
turning
his
back
on
reddy
fox
and
walking
away
with
a
great
deal
of
dignity
v
reddy
fox
sneaks
away
to
sneak
away
is
to
steal
away
trying
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
everybody
and
is
usually
done
only
by
those
who
for
some
reason
or
other
are
ashamed
to
be
seen
just
as
soon
as
reddy
fox
could
see
after
jimmy
skunk
had
thrown
that
terrible
perfume
in
reddy
face
he
started
for
the
green
forest
he
wanted
to
get
away
by
himself
but
he
did
trot
with
his
head
up
and
his
big
plumey
tail
carried
proudly
as
is
usual
with
him
no
indeed
instead
he
hung
his
head
and
his
handsome
tail
was
dropped
between
his
legs
he
was
the
very
picture
of
shame
you
see
that
terrible
perfume
which
jimmy
skunk
had
thrown
at
him
clung
to
his
red
coat
and
he
knew
that
he
could
get
rid
of
it
not
for
a
long
time
anyway
and
he
knew
too
that
wherever
he
went
his
neighbors
would
hold
their
noses
and
make
fun
of
him
and
that
no
one
would
have
anything
to
do
with
him
so
he
sneaked
away
across
the
green
meadows
towards
the
green
forest
and
he
felt
too
sick
and
mean
and
unhappy
to
even
be
angry
with
sammy
jay
who
was
making
fun
of
him
and
saying
that
he
had
got
no
more
than
he
deserved
poor
reddy
he
did
know
what
to
do
or
where
to
go
he
could
go
home
for
old
granny
fox
would
drive
him
out
of
the
house
she
had
warned
him
time
and
again
never
to
provoke
jimmy
skunk
and
he
knew
that
she
never
would
forgive
him
if
he
should
bring
that
terrible
perfume
near
their
home
he
knew
too
that
it
would
not
be
long
before
all
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
would
know
what
had
happened
to
him
sammy
jay
would
see
to
that
he
knew
just
how
they
would
point
at
him
and
make
fun
of
him
he
would
never
hear
the
last
of
it
he
felt
as
if
he
never
never
would
be
able
to
hold
his
head
and
his
tail
up
again
every
few
minutes
he
stopped
to
roll
over
and
over
on
the
ground
trying
to
get
rid
of
that
dreadful
perfume
when
he
reached
the
green
forest
he
hurried
over
to
the
laughing
brook
to
wash
out
his
eyes
it
was
just
his
luck
to
have
billy
mink
come
along
while
he
was
doing
this
billy
did
need
to
be
told
what
had
happened
phew
he
exclaimed
holding
on
to
his
nose
then
he
turned
and
hurried
beyond
the
reach
of
that
perfume
there
he
stopped
and
made
fun
of
reddy
fox
and
said
all
the
provoking
things
he
could
think
of
reddy
took
no
notice
at
all
he
felt
too
miserable
to
quarrel
after
he
had
washed
his
face
he
felt
better
water
would
take
away
the
awful
smell
but
it
did
take
away
the
smart
from
his
eyes
then
he
tried
to
plan
what
to
do
next
the
only
thing
i
can
do
is
to
get
as
far
away
from
everybody
as
i
can
thought
he
i
guess
i
have
to
go
up
to
the
old
pasture
to
live
for
a
while
so
he
started
for
the
old
pasture
keeping
as
much
out
of
sight
as
possible
on
the
way
he
remembered
that
old
man
coyote
lived
there
of
course
it
would
never
do
to
go
near
old
man
coyote
home
for
if
he
smelled
that
awful
perfume
and
discovered
that
he
reddy
was
the
cause
of
it
he
would
certainly
drive
him
out
of
the
old
pasture
and
then
where
could
he
go
so
reddy
went
to
the
loneliest
part
of
the
old
pasture
and
crept
into
an
old
house
that
he
and
granny
had
dug
there
long
ago
when
they
had
been
forced
to
live
in
the
old
pasture
in
the
days
when
farmer
brown
boy
and
bowser
the
hound
had
hunted
them
for
stealing
chickens
there
he
stretched
himself
out
and
was
perfectly
miserable
it
would
be
so
bad
if
i
had
really
been
to
blame
but
i
was
i
did
know
jimmy
skunk
was
in
that
barrel
and
i
did
mean
to
start
it
rolling
down
the
hill
anyway
he
muttered
it
was
all
an
accident
and
he
stopped
and
into
his
yellow
eyes
crept
a
look
of
suspicion
i
wonder
said
he
slowly
if
peter
rabbit
knew
that
jimmy
skunk
was
there
and
planned
to
get
me
into
all
this
trouble
i
wonder
vi
peter
rabbit
does
enjoy
his
joke
all
the
time
that
jimmy
skunk
was
punishing
reddy
fox
for
rolling
him
down
hill
in
a
barrel
and
while
reddy
was
sneaking
away
to
the
green
forest
to
get
out
of
sight
peter
rabbit
was
lying
low
in
the
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
right
near
the
place
where
jimmy
skunk
wild
ride
had
come
to
an
end
it
had
been
a
great
relief
to
peter
when
he
had
seen
jimmy
skunk
get
to
his
feet
and
he
knew
that
jimmy
had
been
hurt
in
that
wild
ride
lying
flat
in
the
doorway
of
johnny
chuck
old
house
peter
could
see
all
that
went
on
without
being
seen
himself
and
he
could
hear
all
that
was
said
he
chuckled
as
he
saw
reddy
fox
come
up
and
his
eyes
were
popping
right
out
with
excitement
as
he
waited
for
what
would
happen
next
he
felt
sure
that
reddy
fox
was
in
for
something
unpleasant
and
he
was
glad
of
course
that
was
a
bit
nice
of
peter
right
down
in
his
heart
peter
knew
it
but
he
had
been
chased
so
often
by
reddy
and
given
so
many
dreadful
frights
that
he
felt
now
that
he
was
getting
even
so
he
chuckled
as
he
waited
for
what
was
to
happen
suddenly
that
chuckle
broke
right
off
in
the
middle
and
peter
cried
ouch
he
had
felt
a
pain
as
if
a
hot
needle
had
been
thrust
into
him
it
made
him
almost
jump
out
of
the
doorway
but
he
remembered
in
time
that
it
would
never
never
do
for
him
to
show
himself
outside
for
right
away
reddy
fox
and
jimmy
skunk
would
suspect
that
he
had
had
something
to
do
with
that
wild
ride
of
jimmy
in
the
barrel
so
it
would
not
do
to
show
himself
now
no
indeed
all
he
could
do
was
to
kick
and
squirm
and
twist
his
head
around
to
see
what
was
happening
it
did
take
long
to
find
out
even
as
he
looked
he
felt
another
sharp
pain
which
brought
another
ouch
from
him
and
made
him
kick
harder
than
ever
two
very
angry
little
insects
were
just
getting
ready
to
sting
him
again
and
more
were
coming
they
were
yellow
jackets
which
you
know
belong
to
the
wasp
family
and
carry
very
sharp
little
lances
in
their
tails
the
fact
is
this
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
had
been
deserted
so
long
the
yellow
jackets
had
decided
that
as
no
one
else
was
using
it
they
would
and
they
had
begun
to
build
their
home
just
inside
the
hall
poor
peter
what
could
he
do
he
did
dare
go
out
and
he
simply
could
stay
where
he
was
whatever
he
did
must
be
done
quickly
for
it
looked
to
him
as
if
a
regular
army
of
yellow
jackets
was
coming
and
those
little
lances
they
carried
were
about
the
most
painful
things
he
knew
of
by
this
time
he
had
lost
all
interest
in
what
was
going
on
outside
there
was
quite
enough
going
on
inside
too
much
in
fact
he
remembered
that
johnny
chuck
digs
his
house
deep
down
in
the
ground
he
looked
down
the
long
hall
it
was
dark
down
there
perhaps
if
he
went
down
there
these
angry
little
warriors
would
follow
him
it
was
worth
trying
anyway
so
peter
scrambled
to
his
feet
and
scurried
down
the
long
hall
and
as
he
ran
he
cried
ouch
ouch
oh
ohoo
those
sharp
little
lances
were
very
busy
and
there
was
no
way
of
fighting
back
at
the
end
of
the
long
hall
was
a
snug
little
room
very
dark
but
cool
and
comfortable
it
was
just
as
he
had
hoped
the
yellow
jackets
did
not
follow
him
down
there
they
had
driven
him
away
from
their
home
which
was
right
near
the
entrance
and
they
were
satisfied
but
what
a
fix
he
was
in
what
a
dreadful
fix
he
ached
and
smarted
all
over
my
goodness
how
he
did
smart
and
to
get
out
he
would
have
to
go
right
past
the
yellow
jacket
home
again
oh
dear
i
wish
i
had
never
thought
of
such
a
joke
moaned
peter
trying
in
vain
to
find
a
comfortable
position
i
guess
i
am
served
just
right
i
rather
think
he
was
do
you
vii
sammy
jay
does
some
guessing
sammy
jay
is
a
queer
fellow
although
he
is
a
scamp
and
dearly
loves
to
make
trouble
for
his
neighbors
he
is
always
ready
to
take
their
part
when
others
make
trouble
for
them
many
are
the
times
he
has
given
them
warning
of
danger
this
is
one
reason
they
are
quite
willing
to
overlook
his
own
shortcomings
so
though
in
many
ways
he
is
no
better
than
reddy
fox
he
dearly
loves
to
upset
reddy
plans
and
is
very
apt
to
rejoice
when
reddy
gets
into
trouble
of
course
being
right
there
he
saw
all
that
happened
when
reddy
ran
against
the
old
barrel
at
the
top
of
the
hill
and
sent
it
rolling
he
had
been
quite
as
much
surprised
as
reddy
to
find
that
there
was
some
one
inside
and
he
had
followed
reddy
to
see
who
it
was
so
of
course
he
had
seen
what
happened
to
reddy
now
instead
of
being
sorry
for
reddy
he
had
openly
rejoiced
it
seems
to
be
just
that
way
with
a
great
many
people
they
like
to
see
others
who
are
considered
very
smart
get
into
trouble
so
sammy
had
laughed
and
made
fun
of
poor
reddy
in
the
first
place
it
was
very
exciting
and
sammy
dearly
loves
excitement
and
then
it
would
make
such
a
splendid
story
to
tell
and
no
one
likes
to
carry
tales
more
than
does
sammy
jay
he
watched
reddy
sneak
away
to
the
green
forest
and
jimmy
skunk
slowly
walk
away
in
a
very
dignified
manner
then
sammy
flew
back
to
the
old
orchard
to
spread
the
news
among
the
little
people
there
it
until
he
reached
the
old
orchard
that
he
remembered
peter
rabbit
instead
of
flying
about
telling
every
one
what
had
happened
to
jimmy
skunk
and
reddy
fox
he
found
a
comfortable
perch
in
an
old
and
was
strangely
silent
the
fact
is
sammy
jay
was
doing
some
hard
thinking
he
had
suddenly
begun
to
wonder
it
had
popped
into
that
shrewd
little
head
of
his
that
it
was
very
strange
how
suddenly
peter
rabbit
had
disappeared
of
course
thought
sammy
jimmy
skunk
is
sure
that
reddy
rolled
that
barrel
down
hill
purposely
and
i
do
wonder
that
he
does
think
so
but
i
saw
it
all
and
i
know
that
it
was
all
an
accident
so
far
as
reddy
was
concerned
i
did
know
that
jimmy
was
in
that
barrel
and
reddy
could
have
known
it
because
he
did
come
up
here
until
after
i
did
but
peter
rabbit
may
have
known
why
did
peter
run
so
that
he
would
have
to
jump
over
that
barrel
when
he
could
have
run
right
past
it
of
course
he
may
have
thought
that
if
he
could
make
reddy
run
right
slam
bang
against
that
barrel
it
would
stop
reddy
long
enough
to
give
him
a
chance
to
get
away
that
would
have
been
pretty
smart
of
peter
and
quite
like
him
but
somehow
i
have
a
feeling
that
he
knew
all
the
time
that
jimmy
skunk
was
taking
a
nap
inside
and
that
something
was
bound
to
happen
if
he
was
disturbed
the
more
i
think
of
it
the
more
i
believe
that
peter
did
know
and
that
he
planned
the
whole
thing
if
he
did
it
was
one
of
the
smartest
tricks
i
ever
heard
of
i
did
think
peter
had
it
in
him
it
was
rather
hard
on
jimmy
skunk
but
it
got
rid
of
reddy
fox
for
a
while
he
wo
dare
show
his
face
around
here
for
a
long
time
that
means
that
peter
will
have
one
less
worry
on
his
mind
hello
here
comes
jimmy
skunk
i
ask
him
a
few
questions
jimmy
came
ambling
along
in
his
usual
lazy
manner
he
had
quite
recovered
his
good
nature
he
felt
that
he
was
more
than
even
with
reddy
fox
and
as
he
was
none
the
worse
for
his
wild
ride
in
the
barrel
he
had
quite
forgotten
that
he
had
lost
his
temper
hello
jimmy
have
you
seen
peter
rabbit
this
morning
cried
sammy
jay
jimmy
looked
up
and
grinned
yes
said
he
i
saw
him
up
here
early
this
morning
why
did
he
see
you
go
into
that
old
barrel
persisted
sammy
i
do
know
confessed
jimmy
he
may
have
what
have
you
got
on
your
mind
sammy
jay
nothing
much
only
reddy
fox
was
chasing
him
when
he
ran
against
that
barrel
and
sent
you
rolling
down
the
hill
replied
sammy
jimmy
pricked
up
his
ears
then
reddy
did
do
it
purposely
he
exclaimed
no
replied
sammy
he
did
do
it
purposely
i
am
quite
sure
that
he
did
know
you
were
in
it
but
how
about
peter
rabbit
i
am
wondering
and
i
doing
a
little
guessing
too
viii
jimmy
skunk
looks
for
peter
jimmy
skunk
looked
very
hard
at
sammy
jay
sammy
jay
looked
very
hard
at
jimmy
skunk
then
sammy
slowly
shut
one
eye
and
as
slowly
opened
it
again
it
was
a
wink
you
mean
said
jimmy
skunk
that
you
guess
that
peter
rabbit
knew
that
i
was
in
that
barrel
and
that
he
jumped
over
it
so
as
to
make
reddy
fox
run
against
it
is
that
it
sammy
jay
said
nothing
but
winked
again
jimmy
grinned
then
he
looked
thoughtful
i
wonder
said
he
slowly
if
peter
did
it
so
as
to
gain
time
to
get
away
from
reddy
fox
i
wonder
said
sammy
jay
and
i
wonder
if
he
did
it
just
to
get
reddy
into
trouble
continued
jimmy
i
wonder
repeated
sammy
jay
and
i
wonder
if
he
did
it
for
a
joke
a
double
joke
on
reddy
and
myself
jimmy
went
on
scratching
his
head
thoughtfully
i
wonder
said
sammy
jay
once
more
and
burst
out
laughing
now
jimmy
skunk
has
a
very
shrewd
little
head
on
his
shoulders
so
that
is
your
guess
is
it
well
i
would
be
a
bit
surprised
if
you
are
right
said
he
nodding
his
head
i
think
i
will
go
look
for
peter
i
think
he
needs
a
lesson
jokes
that
put
other
people
in
danger
or
make
them
uncomfortable
can
have
no
excuse
my
neck
might
have
been
broken
in
that
wild
ride
down
the
hill
and
certainly
i
was
made
most
uncomfortable
i
felt
as
if
everything
inside
me
was
shaken
out
of
place
and
all
mixed
up
even
now
my
stomach
feels
a
bit
queer
as
if
it
might
not
be
just
where
it
ought
to
be
by
the
way
what
became
of
peter
after
he
jumped
over
the
barrel
sammy
shook
his
head
i
do
know
he
confessed
you
see
it
was
very
exciting
when
that
barrel
started
rolling
and
we
knew
by
the
sounds
that
there
was
some
one
inside
it
i
guess
reddy
fox
forgot
all
about
peter
i
know
i
did
and
when
the
barrel
broke
to
pieces
against
that
stone
down
there
and
you
and
reddy
faced
each
other
it
was
still
more
exciting
after
it
was
over
i
looked
for
peter
but
he
was
nowhere
in
sight
he
had
had
time
to
reach
the
old
i
really
would
like
to
know
myself
what
became
of
him
jimmy
skunk
turned
and
looked
down
the
hill
then
in
his
usual
slow
way
he
started
back
towards
the
broken
barrel
where
are
you
going
asked
sammy
to
look
for
peter
rabbit
replied
jimmy
i
want
to
ask
him
a
few
questions
jimmy
skunk
ambled
along
down
the
hill
at
first
he
was
very
angry
as
he
thought
of
what
peter
had
done
and
he
made
up
his
mind
that
peter
should
be
taught
a
lesson
he
would
never
forget
but
as
he
ambled
along
the
funny
side
of
the
whole
affair
struck
him
for
jimmy
skunk
has
a
great
sense
of
humor
and
before
he
reached
the
bottom
of
the
hill
his
anger
had
all
gone
and
he
was
chuckling
i
sorry
if
i
did
reddy
fox
an
injustice
thought
he
but
he
makes
so
much
trouble
for
other
people
that
i
guess
no
one
else
will
be
sorry
he
is
likely
to
bother
any
one
for
some
time
peter
really
ought
to
be
punished
but
somehow
i
do
feel
so
much
like
punishing
him
as
i
did
i
just
give
him
a
little
scare
and
let
the
scamp
off
with
that
now
i
wonder
where
he
can
be
i
have
an
idea
he
is
very
far
away
let
me
see
seems
to
me
i
remember
an
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
not
very
far
from
here
i
have
a
look
in
that
illustration
ix
jimmy
visits
johnny
chuck
old
house
jimmy
skunk
was
smiling
as
he
ambled
towards
the
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
near
the
foot
of
the
hill
there
was
no
one
near
to
see
him
and
this
made
him
smile
still
more
you
see
the
odor
of
that
perfume
which
he
had
thrown
at
reddy
fox
just
a
little
while
before
was
very
very
strong
there
and
jimmy
knew
that
until
that
had
disappeared
no
one
would
come
near
the
place
because
it
was
so
unpleasant
for
every
one
to
jimmy
himself
it
was
unpleasant
at
all
and
he
could
understand
why
other
people
disliked
it
so
he
had
puzzled
over
that
a
great
deal
he
was
glad
that
it
was
so
because
on
account
of
it
every
one
treated
him
with
respect
and
took
special
pains
not
to
quarrel
with
him
i
guess
it
a
good
thing
that
old
mother
nature
did
make
us
all
alike
said
he
to
himself
i
think
there
must
be
something
the
matter
with
their
noses
and
i
suppose
they
think
there
is
something
the
matter
with
mine
but
there
is
not
a
thing
hello
there
is
johnny
old
house
just
ahead
of
me
now
we
will
see
what
we
shall
see
he
walked
softly
as
he
drew
near
to
the
old
house
if
peter
was
way
down
inside
it
would
matter
how
he
approached
but
if
peter
should
happen
to
be
only
just
inside
the
doorway
he
might
take
it
into
his
head
to
run
if
he
should
hear
footsteps
particularly
if
those
footsteps
were
not
heavy
enough
to
be
those
of
reddy
or
granny
fox
or
old
man
coyote
jimmy
did
intend
to
give
peter
a
chance
to
do
any
such
thing
if
peter
once
got
outside
that
old
house
his
long
legs
would
soon
put
him
beyond
jimmy
reach
and
jimmy
knew
it
if
he
was
to
give
peter
the
fright
that
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
give
him
he
would
first
have
to
get
him
where
he
could
run
away
so
jimmy
walked
as
softly
as
he
knew
how
and
approached
the
old
house
in
such
a
way
as
to
keep
out
of
sight
of
peter
should
he
happen
to
be
lying
so
as
to
look
out
of
the
doorway
at
last
he
reached
a
position
where
with
one
jump
he
could
land
right
on
the
doorstep
he
waited
a
few
minutes
and
cocked
his
head
on
one
side
to
listen
there
was
a
sound
to
tell
him
whether
peter
was
there
or
not
then
lightly
he
jumped
over
to
the
doorstep
and
looked
in
at
the
doorway
there
was
no
peter
to
be
seen
if
he
is
here
he
is
way
down
inside
thought
jimmy
i
wonder
if
he
really
is
here
i
think
i
look
about
a
bit
before
i
go
in
now
the
doorstep
was
of
sand
as
johnny
chuck
doorsteps
always
are
almost
at
once
jimmy
chuckled
there
were
peter
tracks
and
they
pointed
straight
towards
the
inside
of
johnny
chuck
old
house
jimmy
looked
carefully
but
not
a
single
track
pointing
the
other
way
could
he
find
then
he
chuckled
again
the
scamp
is
here
all
right
he
muttered
he
hid
here
and
watched
all
that
happened
and
then
decided
to
lie
low
and
wait
until
he
was
sure
that
the
way
was
clear
and
no
one
would
see
him
in
this
jimmy
was
partly
right
and
partly
wrong
as
you
and
i
know
he
stared
down
the
long
dark
doorway
a
minute
then
he
made
up
his
mind
i
go
down
and
make
peter
a
call
and
i
wo
bother
to
knock
he
chuckled
and
poked
his
head
inside
the
doorway
but
that
was
as
far
as
jimmy
skunk
went
yes
sir
that
was
just
as
far
as
jimmy
skunk
went
you
see
no
sooner
did
he
start
to
enter
that
old
house
of
johnny
chuck
than
he
was
met
by
a
lot
of
those
yellow
jackets
and
they
were
in
a
very
bad
temper
jimmy
skunk
knows
all
about
yellow
jackets
and
the
sharp
little
lances
they
carry
in
their
tails
he
has
the
greatest
respect
for
them
he
backed
out
in
a
hurry
and
actually
hurried
away
to
a
safe
distance
then
he
sat
down
to
think
after
a
little
he
began
to
chuckle
again
i
know
what
happened
said
he
talking
to
himself
peter
rabbit
popped
into
that
doorway
those
yellow
jackets
just
naturally
got
after
him
he
did
dare
come
out
for
fear
of
reddy
fox
and
me
and
so
he
went
on
down
to
jimmy
chuck
old
bedroom
and
he
down
there
now
wondering
how
ever
he
is
to
get
out
without
getting
stung
i
reckon
i
do
need
to
scare
peter
to
pay
him
for
that
joke
i
reckon
he
been
punished
already
illustration
x
peter
rabbit
is
most
uncomfortable
if
ever
any
one
was
sorry
for
having
played
pranks
on
other
folks
that
one
was
peter
rabbit
i
am
afraid
it
was
quite
the
right
kind
of
sorrow
you
see
he
was
sorry
because
of
what
had
happened
to
jimmy
skunk
and
reddy
fox
but
because
of
what
had
happened
to
himself
there
he
was
down
in
the
bedroom
of
johnny
chuck
old
house
smarting
and
aching
all
over
from
the
sharp
little
lances
of
the
yellow
jackets
who
had
driven
him
down
there
before
he
had
had
a
chance
to
see
what
happened
to
reddy
fox
that
was
bad
enough
but
what
troubled
peter
more
was
the
thought
that
he
could
get
out
without
once
again
facing
those
yellow
jackets
peter
wished
with
all
his
might
that
he
had
known
about
their
home
in
johnny
chuck
old
house
before
ever
he
thought
of
hiding
there
but
wishes
of
that
kind
are
about
the
most
useless
things
in
the
world
they
would
help
him
now
he
had
so
many
aches
and
smarts
that
he
did
see
how
he
could
stand
a
single
one
more
and
yet
he
could
see
how
he
was
going
to
get
out
without
receiving
several
more
all
at
once
he
had
a
comforting
thought
he
remembered
that
johnny
chuck
usually
has
a
back
door
if
that
were
the
case
here
he
would
be
all
right
he
would
find
out
cautiously
he
poked
his
head
out
of
the
snug
bedroom
there
was
the
long
hall
down
which
he
had
come
and
there
yes
sir
there
was
another
hall
it
must
be
the
way
to
the
back
door
carefully
peter
crept
up
it
funny
thought
he
that
i
do
see
any
light
ahead
of
me
and
then
he
bumped
his
nose
yes
sir
peter
bumped
his
nose
against
the
end
of
that
hall
you
see
it
was
an
old
house
and
like
most
old
houses
it
was
rather
a
affair
anyway
the
back
door
had
been
blocked
with
a
great
stone
and
the
walls
of
the
back
hall
had
fallen
in
there
was
no
way
out
there
sadly
peter
backed
out
to
the
little
bedroom
he
would
wait
until
night
and
perhaps
then
the
yellow
jackets
would
be
asleep
and
he
could
steal
out
the
front
way
without
getting
any
more
stings
meanwhile
he
would
try
to
get
a
nap
and
forget
his
aches
and
pains
hardly
had
peter
curled
up
for
that
nap
when
he
heard
a
voice
it
sounded
as
if
it
came
from
a
long
way
off
but
he
knew
just
where
it
came
from
it
came
from
the
doorway
of
that
old
house
he
knew
too
whose
voice
it
was
it
was
jimmy
skunk
voice
i
know
where
you
are
peter
rabbit
said
the
voice
and
i
know
why
you
are
hiding
down
there
i
know
too
how
it
happened
that
i
was
rolled
down
hill
in
that
barrel
i
just
giving
you
a
little
warning
peter
there
are
a
lot
of
very
angry
yellow
jackets
up
here
as
you
will
find
out
if
you
try
to
come
out
before
dark
i
going
away
now
but
going
to
come
back
about
dark
to
wait
for
you
i
may
want
to
play
a
little
joke
on
you
to
pay
you
back
for
the
one
you
played
on
me
that
put
an
end
to
peter
hope
of
a
nap
he
shivered
as
he
thought
of
what
might
happen
to
him
if
jimmy
skunk
should
catch
him
what
with
his
aches
and
pains
from
the
stings
of
the
yellow
jackets
and
fear
of
being
caught
by
jimmy
skunk
it
was
quite
impossible
to
sleep
he
was
almost
ready
to
face
those
yellow
jackets
rather
than
wait
and
meet
jimmy
skunk
twice
he
started
up
the
long
hall
but
turned
back
he
just
could
stand
any
more
stings
he
was
miserable
yes
sir
he
was
miserable
and
most
uncomfortable
in
both
body
and
mind
i
wish
i
never
thought
of
that
joke
he
half
sobbed
i
thought
it
was
a
great
joke
but
it
was
it
was
a
horrid
mean
joke
why
oh
why
did
i
ever
think
of
it
meanwhile
jimmy
skunk
had
gone
off
chuckling
xi
jimmy
skunk
keeps
his
word
keep
your
word
you
do
and
to
your
inmost
self
be
true
when
jimmy
skunk
shouted
down
the
hall
of
johnny
chuck
old
house
to
peter
rabbit
that
he
would
come
back
at
dark
he
was
half
joking
he
did
it
to
make
peter
uneasy
and
to
worry
him
the
truth
is
jimmy
was
no
longer
angry
at
all
he
had
quite
recovered
his
good
nature
and
was
very
much
inclined
to
laugh
himself
over
peter
trick
but
he
felt
that
it
would
do
to
let
peter
off
without
some
kind
of
punishment
and
so
he
decided
to
frighten
peter
a
little
he
knew
that
peter
would
dare
come
out
during
the
daytime
because
of
the
yellow
jackets
whose
home
was
just
inside
the
doorway
of
that
old
house
and
he
knew
that
peter
would
dare
face
him
for
he
would
be
afraid
of
being
treated
as
reddy
fox
had
been
so
that
is
why
he
told
peter
that
he
was
coming
back
at
dark
he
felt
that
if
peter
was
kept
a
prisoner
in
there
for
a
while
all
the
time
worrying
about
how
he
was
to
get
out
he
would
be
very
slow
to
try
such
a
trick
again
as
jimmy
ambled
away
to
look
for
some
beetles
he
chuckled
and
chuckled
and
chuckled
i
guess
that
by
this
time
peter
wishes
he
had
thought
of
that
joke
on
reddy
fox
and
myself
said
he
perhaps
i
go
back
there
tonight
and
perhaps
i
wo
he
wo
know
whether
i
do
or
not
and
he
wo
dare
come
out
then
he
stopped
and
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
then
he
sighed
then
he
scratched
his
head
again
and
once
more
sighed
i
really
want
to
go
back
there
tonight
he
muttered
but
i
guess
i
have
to
i
said
i
would
and
so
i
have
to
do
it
i
believe
in
keeping
my
word
if
i
should
and
some
day
he
should
find
it
out
he
would
believe
me
the
next
time
i
happened
to
say
i
would
do
a
thing
yes
sir
have
to
go
back
there
is
nothing
like
making
people
believe
that
when
you
say
a
thing
you
mean
it
there
is
nothing
like
keeping
your
word
to
make
people
respect
you
being
naturally
rather
lazy
jimmy
decided
not
to
go
any
farther
than
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
which
was
only
a
little
way
above
johnny
chuck
old
house
where
peter
was
a
prisoner
there
jimmy
found
a
warm
sunny
spot
and
curled
up
for
a
nap
in
fact
he
spent
all
the
day
there
when
jolly
round
red
sun
went
to
bed
behind
the
purple
hills
and
the
black
shadows
came
trooping
across
the
green
meadows
jimmy
got
up
yawned
chuckled
and
then
slowly
ambled
down
to
johnny
chuck
old
house
a
look
at
the
footprints
in
the
sand
on
the
doorstep
told
him
that
peter
had
not
come
out
jimmy
sat
down
and
waited
until
it
was
quite
dark
then
he
poked
his
head
in
at
the
doorway
the
yellow
jackets
had
gone
to
bed
for
the
night
come
out
peter
i
waiting
for
you
he
called
down
the
hall
and
made
his
voice
sound
as
angry
as
he
could
but
inside
he
was
chuckling
then
jimmy
skunk
calmly
turned
and
went
about
his
business
he
had
kept
his
word
as
for
peter
rabbit
that
had
been
one
of
the
very
worst
days
he
could
recall
he
had
ached
and
smarted
from
the
stings
of
the
yellow
jackets
he
had
worried
all
day
about
what
would
happen
to
him
if
he
did
meet
jimmy
skunk
and
he
was
hungry
he
had
had
just
a
little
bit
of
hope
and
this
was
that
jimmy
skunk
would
come
back
when
it
grew
dark
he
had
crept
part
way
up
the
hall
at
the
first
hint
of
night
and
stretched
himself
out
to
wait
until
he
could
be
sure
that
those
dreadful
yellow
jackets
had
gone
to
sleep
he
had
just
about
made
up
his
mind
that
it
was
safe
for
him
to
scamper
out
when
jimmy
skunk
voice
came
down
the
hall
to
him
poor
peter
the
sound
of
that
voice
almost
broke
his
heart
he
has
come
back
he
kept
his
word
he
half
sobbed
as
he
once
more
went
back
to
johnny
chuck
old
bedroom
there
he
stayed
nearly
all
the
rest
of
the
night
though
his
stomach
was
so
empty
it
ached
just
before
it
was
time
for
sun
to
rise
peter
ventured
to
dash
out
of
johnny
chuck
old
house
he
got
past
the
home
of
the
yellow
jackets
safely
for
they
were
not
yet
awake
with
his
heart
in
his
mouth
he
sprang
out
of
the
doorway
jimmy
skunk
there
with
a
sigh
of
relief
peter
started
for
the
dear
safe
old
as
fast
as
he
could
go
i
never
never
play
another
joke
he
said
over
and
over
again
as
he
ran
xii
jimmy
skunk
and
unc
billy
possum
meet
jimmy
skunk
ambled
along
down
the
lone
little
path
through
the
green
forest
he
did
hurry
jimmy
never
does
hurry
hurrying
and
worrying
are
two
things
he
leaves
for
his
neighbors
now
and
then
jimmy
stopped
to
turn
over
a
bit
of
bark
or
a
stick
hoping
to
find
some
fat
beetles
but
it
was
plain
to
see
that
he
had
something
besides
fat
beetles
on
his
mind
up
the
lone
little
path
through
the
green
forest
shuffled
unc
billy
possum
he
did
hurry
it
was
too
warm
to
hurry
unlike
jimmy
skunk
he
does
hurry
sometimes
does
unc
billy
especially
when
he
suspects
that
bowser
the
hound
is
about
and
sometimes
unc
billy
does
worry
you
see
there
are
people
who
think
that
unc
billy
would
make
a
very
good
dinner
unc
billy
does
think
he
would
anyway
he
has
no
desire
to
have
the
experiment
tried
so
occasionally
when
he
discovers
one
of
these
people
who
think
he
would
make
a
good
dinner
he
worries
a
little
but
just
now
unc
billy
was
neither
hurrying
nor
worrying
there
was
no
need
of
doing
either
and
unc
billy
never
does
anything
that
there
is
no
need
of
doing
so
unc
billy
shuffled
up
the
lone
little
path
and
jimmy
skunk
ambled
down
the
lone
little
path
and
right
at
a
bend
in
the
lone
little
path
they
met
illustration
jimmy
skunk
grinned
hello
unc
billy
said
he
have
you
seen
any
fat
beetles
this
morning
unc
billy
grinned
good
brer
skunk
he
replied
ah
rightly
say
ah
have
ah
had
it
on
mah
mind
to
ask
yo
the
same
thing
jimmy
sat
down
and
looked
at
unc
billy
with
twinkling
eyes
his
grin
grew
broader
and
became
a
chuckle
unc
billy
said
he
have
you
ever
in
your
life
combed
your
hair
or
brushed
your
coat
you
know
unc
billy
usually
looks
as
if
every
hair
was
trying
to
point
in
a
different
direction
from
every
other
hair
while
jimmy
skunk
always
appears
as
neat
as
if
he
spent
half
his
time
brushing
and
smoothing
his
handsome
black
and
white
coat
unc
billy
eyes
twinkled
ah
reckons
ah
did
such
a
thing
once
or
twice
when
ah
was
very
small
brer
skunk
said
he
without
a
trace
of
a
smile
but
it
seems
to
me
a
powerful
waste
of
time
ah
have
important
things
to
worry
about
by
the
way
brer
skunk
did
yo
ever
run
away
from
anybody
in
all
your
life
jimmy
looked
surprised
at
the
question
he
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
not
that
i
remember
of
said
he
after
a
little
most
folks
run
away
from
me
he
added
with
a
little
throaty
chuckle
those
who
do
run
away
always
are
polite
and
step
aside
it
may
be
that
when
i
was
a
very
little
fellow
and
did
know
much
about
the
great
world
and
the
people
who
live
in
it
i
might
have
run
away
from
some
one
but
if
i
did
i
ca
remember
it
why
do
you
ask
unc
billy
oh
no
reason
in
particular
brer
skunk
no
reason
in
particular
only
ah
wonder
sometimes
if
yo
ever
realize
how
lucky
yo
are
if
ah
never
had
to
worry
about
mah
hungry
neighbors
ah
reckons
perhaps
ah
might
brush
mah
coat
oftener
unc
billy
eyes
twinkled
more
than
ever
worry
replied
jimmy
skunk
sagely
is
the
result
of
being
unprepared
anybody
who
is
prepared
has
no
occasion
to
worry
just
think
it
over
unc
billy
it
was
unc
billy
turn
to
scratch
his
head
thoughtfully
ah
fear
ah
do
quite
get
your
meaning
brer
skunk
said
he
sit
down
unc
billy
and
i
explain
replied
jimmy
xiii
jimmy
skunk
explains
you
find
this
true
you
go
that
those
prepared
few
troubles
know
to
begin
with
i
am
not
such
a
very
big
fellow
am
i
said
jimmy
ah
reckons
ah
knows
a
right
smart
lot
of
folks
bigger
than
yo
brer
skunk
replied
unc
billy
with
a
grin
you
know
jimmy
skunk
really
is
a
little
fellow
compared
with
some
of
his
neighbors
and
i
have
very
long
claws
or
very
big
teeth
have
i
continued
jimmy
ah
reckons
mine
are
about
as
long
and
about
as
big
returned
billy
looking
more
puzzled
than
ever
but
you
never
see
anybody
bothering
me
do
you
went
on
jimmy
no
replied
unc
billy
and
it
the
same
way
with
prickly
porky
the
porcupine
you
never
see
anybody
bothering
him
or
offering
to
do
him
any
harm
do
you
persisted
jimmy
no
replied
unc
billy
once
more
why
demanded
jimmy
unc
billy
grinned
broadly
ah
reckons
brer
skunk
said
he
that
there
is
anybody
wants
to
go
fo
to
meddle
with
yo
and
brer
porky
ah
reckons
most
folks
knows
what
would
happen
if
they
did
and
that
and
brer
porky
are
folks
it
a
sight
mo
comfortable
to
leave
alone
leastways
ah
does
ah
ai
aiming
fo
trouble
with
either
of
yo
that
bag
of
scent
yo
carry
is
most
powerful
brer
skunk
and
ah
is
hankering
to
brush
against
those
little
spears
brer
porky
is
so
free
with
ah
knows
when
ah
well
off
and
ah
reckons
most
folks
feel
the
same
way
jimmy
skunk
chuckled
one
more
question
unc
billy
said
he
did
you
ever
know
me
to
pick
a
quarrel
and
use
that
bag
of
scent
without
being
attacked
unc
billy
considered
for
a
few
minutes
ah
ca
say
ah
ever
did
he
replied
and
you
never
knew
prickly
porky
to
go
hunting
trouble
either
declared
jimmy
we
do
either
of
us
go
hunting
trouble
and
trouble
never
comes
hunting
us
and
the
reason
is
that
we
both
are
always
prepared
for
trouble
and
everybody
knows
it
buster
bear
could
squash
me
by
just
stepping
on
me
but
he
does
try
it
you
notice
he
always
is
very
polite
when
we
meet
prickly
porky
and
i
are
armed
for
but
we
never
use
our
weapons
for
nobody
bothers
us
and
we
bother
nobody
that
the
beauty
of
being
prepared
unc
billy
thought
it
over
for
a
few
minutes
then
he
sighed
and
sighed
again
ah
reckons
yo
and
brer
porky
are
about
the
luckiest
people
ah
knows
said
he
yes
sah
ah
reckons
yo
is
just
that
ah
do
fear
anybody
mah
own
size
but
ah
does
have
some
mighty
scary
times
when
ah
meets
some
people
ah
might
mention
ah
wish
ol
mother
nature
had
done
gone
and
given
me
something
fo
to
make
people
as
scary
of
me
as
they
are
of
yo
ah
believes
in
preparedness
after
seein
yo
brer
skunk
ah
does
just
that
very
thing
have
yo
found
any
nice
fresh
aiggs
lately
xiv
a
little
something
about
eggs
an
egg
says
jimmy
skunk
is
good
it
very
good
indeed
to
eat
an
egg
says
grouse
is
dear
hatch
into
a
baby
sweet
so
in
the
matter
of
eggs
as
in
a
great
many
other
matters
it
all
depends
on
the
point
of
view
to
jimmy
skunk
and
unc
billy
possum
eggs
are
looked
on
from
the
viewpoint
of
something
to
eat
their
stomachs
prompt
them
to
think
of
eggs
eggs
are
good
to
fill
empty
stomachs
the
mere
thought
of
eggs
will
make
jimmy
and
unc
billy
smack
their
lips
they
say
they
love
eggs
but
they
do
they
like
them
which
is
quite
different
but
grouse
and
most
of
the
other
feathered
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
and
the
old
orchard
really
do
love
eggs
it
is
the
heart
instead
of
the
stomach
that
responds
to
the
thought
of
eggs
to
them
eggs
are
almost
as
precious
as
babies
because
they
know
that
some
day
some
day
very
soon
those
eggs
will
become
babies
there
are
a
few
feathered
folks
i
am
sorry
to
say
who
love
their
own
eggs
but
like
the
eggs
of
other
people
like
them
just
as
jimmy
skunk
and
unc
billy
possum
do
to
eat
blacky
the
crow
is
one
and
his
cousin
sammy
jay
is
another
so
in
the
springtime
there
is
always
a
great
deal
of
matching
of
wits
between
the
little
people
of
the
green
forest
and
the
green
meadows
and
the
old
orchard
those
who
have
eggs
try
to
keep
them
a
secret
or
to
build
the
nests
that
hold
them
where
none
who
like
to
eat
them
can
get
them
and
those
who
have
an
appetite
for
eggs
try
to
find
them
when
unc
billy
possum
suddenly
changed
the
subject
by
asking
jimmy
skunk
if
he
had
found
any
nice
fresh
eggs
lately
he
touched
a
subject
very
close
to
jimmy
heart
i
should
have
said
rather
his
stomach
to
tell
the
truth
it
was
a
longing
for
some
eggs
that
had
brought
jimmy
to
the
green
forest
he
knew
that
somewhere
there
grouse
must
be
hiding
a
nestful
of
the
very
nicest
of
eggs
and
it
was
to
hunt
for
these
that
he
had
come
no
replied
jimmy
i
have
had
any
luck
at
all
this
spring
almost
forgotten
what
an
egg
tastes
like
either
i
growing
dull
and
stupid
or
some
folks
are
smarter
than
they
used
to
be
by
the
way
have
you
seen
grouse
lately
jimmy
looked
very
innocent
as
he
asked
this
unc
billy
chuckled
until
his
sides
shook
do
yo
suppose
ah
tell
if
ah
had
he
demanded
ah
reckons
grouse
has
got
any
aiggs
than
ah
could
comfortably
take
care
of
mahself
not
to
mention
mrs
possum
here
unc
billy
looked
back
over
his
shoulder
to
make
sure
that
old
possum
was
within
hearing
and
jimmy
skunk
chuckled
seems
to
me
brer
skunk
yo
might
better
do
your
aigg
hunting
on
the
green
meadows
and
leave
the
green
forest
to
me
continued
unc
billy
that
would
be
no
mo
than
fair
yo
know
ah
never
did
hanker
fo
to
get
far
away
from
trees
but
yo
do
mind
besides
there
are
mo
aiggs
for
yo
to
find
on
the
green
meadows
than
there
are
fo
me
to
find
in
the
green
forest
a
right
smart
lot
of
birds
make
their
nests
on
the
ground
there
there
is
brer
bob
white
and
brer
meadowlark
and
brer
bobolink
and
brer
field
sparrow
and
brer
never
mind
any
more
unc
billy
interrupted
jimmy
skunk
i
know
all
about
them
that
is
i
know
all
about
them
i
want
to
know
except
where
their
eggs
are
did
i
just
tell
you
i
have
had
any
luck
at
all
that
why
i
over
here
well
yo
wo
have
any
mo
luck
here
unless
yo
are
a
right
smart
lot
sharper
than
your
unc
billy
and
when
it
comes
to
hunting
aiggs
ah
do
take
mah
hat
off
to
anybody
not
even
to
yo
brer
skunk
replied
unc
billy
xv
a
second
meeting
jimmy
skunk
could
think
of
anything
but
eggs
the
more
he
thought
of
them
the
more
he
wanted
some
after
parting
from
unc
billy
possum
in
the
green
forest
he
went
back
to
the
green
meadows
and
prowled
about
hunting
for
the
nests
of
his
feathered
neighbors
who
build
on
the
ground
and
having
no
more
luck
than
he
had
had
before
unc
billy
possum
was
faring
about
the
same
way
he
could
for
the
life
of
him
stop
thinking
about
those
eggs
that
belonged
to
grouse
the
more
he
tried
to
forget
about
them
the
more
he
thought
about
them
ah
feels
it
in
mah
bones
that
there
is
the
least
bit
of
use
in
huntin
fo
them
said
he
to
himself
as
he
watched
jimmy
skunk
amble
out
of
sight
up
the
lone
little
path
no
sah
there
is
the
least
bit
of
use
ah
done
look
every
place
ah
can
think
of
already
still
ah
have
got
anything
else
special
on
mah
mind
and
those
aiggs
would
taste
good
ah
reckons
it
must
be
ah
needs
those
aiggs
or
ah
would
have
them
on
mah
mind
so
much
ah
finds
it
rather
painful
to
carry
aiggs
on
mah
mind
all
the
time
but
ah
would
enjoy
carrying
them
in
mah
stomach
ah
would
unc
billy
grinned
and
started
to
ramble
about
aimlessly
hoping
that
chance
would
lead
him
to
the
nest
of
grouse
do
what
he
would
unc
billy
could
get
the
thought
of
eggs
off
his
mind
and
the
more
he
thought
about
them
the
more
he
wanted
some
and
that
led
him
to
think
of
farmer
brown
henhouse
he
had
long
ago
resolved
never
again
to
go
there
but
the
longing
for
a
taste
of
eggs
was
too
much
for
his
good
resolutions
and
as
soon
as
jolly
round
red
sun
sank
to
rest
behind
the
purple
hills
and
the
black
shadows
came
creeping
across
the
green
meadows
and
through
the
green
forest
billy
slipped
away
taking
pains
that
old
possum
should
suspect
where
he
was
going
out
from
the
green
forest
keeping
among
the
black
shadows
along
by
the
old
stone
wall
on
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
he
stole
and
so
at
last
he
reached
farmer
brown
henhouse
he
stopped
to
listen
there
was
no
sign
of
bowser
the
hound
and
unc
billy
sighed
gently
it
was
a
sigh
of
relief
then
he
crept
around
a
corner
of
the
henhouse
towards
a
certain
hole
under
it
he
remembered
well
just
as
he
reached
it
he
saw
something
white
it
moved
it
was
coming
towards
him
from
the
other
end
of
the
henhouse
unc
billy
stopped
right
where
he
was
he
was
undecided
whether
to
run
or
stay
then
he
heard
a
little
grunt
and
decided
to
stay
he
even
grinned
a
few
seconds
later
up
came
jimmy
skunk
it
was
a
white
stripe
on
jimmy
coat
that
unc
billy
had
seen
jimmy
gave
a
little
snort
of
surprise
when
he
almost
bumped
into
billy
what
are
you
doing
here
he
demanded
just
taking
a
walk
fo
the
good
of
mah
appetite
replied
billy
grinning
more
broadly
than
ever
what
are
yo
doing
here
brer
skunk
the
same
thing
replied
jimmy
then
he
chuckled
this
is
an
unexpected
meeting
i
guess
you
must
have
had
the
same
thing
on
your
mind
all
day
that
i
have
he
added
ah
reckon
so
replied
unc
billy
and
both
grinned

a
matter
of
politeness
it
costs
not
much
to
be
polite
and
furthermore
it
always
right
unc
billy
possum
and
jimmy
skunk
facing
each
other
among
the
black
shadows
close
by
a
hole
that
led
under
farmer
brown
henhouse
chuckled
as
each
thought
of
what
had
brought
the
other
there
it
is
queer
how
a
like
thought
often
brings
people
together
unc
billy
had
the
same
longing
in
his
stomach
that
jimmy
skunk
had
and
jimmy
skunk
had
the
same
thing
on
his
mind
that
unc
billy
had
more
than
this
it
was
the
second
time
that
day
that
they
had
met
they
had
met
in
the
morning
in
the
green
forest
and
now
they
had
met
again
among
the
black
shadows
of
the
evening
at
farmer
brown
henhouse
and
it
was
all
on
account
of
eggs
yes
sir
it
was
all
on
account
of
eggs
are
you
just
coming
out
or
are
you
just
going
in
jimmy
inquired
politely
ah
was
just
going
in
but
ah
follow
yo
brer
skunk
replied
billy
just
as
politely
nothing
of
the
kind
returned
jimmy
i
would
for
a
minute
think
of
going
before
you
i
hope
i
know
my
manners
better
than
that
yo
are
most
polite
brer
skunk
yo
are
most
polite
yo
are
a
credit
to
your
bringing
up
but
politeness
always
did
run
in
your
family
there
is
a
saying
that
is
as
does
and
your
politeness
is
as
fine
as
yo
are
brer
skunk
ah
just
step
one
side
and
let
yo
go
first
just
to
show
that
ah
does
appreciate
your
friendship
said
unc
billy
jimmy
skunk
chuckled
i
guess
you
forgotten
that
other
old
saying
before
beauty
unc
billy
said
he
so
you
go
first
you
know
you
are
older
than
i
could
think
of
being
so
impolite
as
to
go
first
i
really
could
think
of
such
a
thing
and
so
they
argued
and
argued
each
insisting
in
the
most
polite
way
that
the
other
should
go
first
if
the
truth
were
known
neither
of
them
was
insisting
out
of
politeness
at
all
no
sir
politeness
had
nothing
to
do
with
it
jimmy
skunk
wanted
unc
billy
to
go
first
because
jimmy
believes
in
safety
first
and
it
had
popped
into
jimmy
head
that
there
might
there
just
might
happen
to
be
a
trap
inside
that
hole
if
there
was
he
much
preferred
that
unc
billy
should
be
the
one
to
find
it
out
yes
sir
that
is
why
jimmy
skunk
was
so
very
polite
unc
billy
wanted
jimmy
to
go
first
because
he
always
feels
safer
behind
jimmy
than
in
front
of
him
he
has
great
respect
for
that
little
bag
of
scent
that
jimmy
carries
and
he
knows
that
when
jimmy
makes
use
of
it
he
always
throws
it
in
front
and
never
behind
him
jimmy
seldom
uses
it
but
sometimes
he
does
if
he
happens
to
be
startled
and
thinks
danger
near
so
unc
billy
preferred
that
jimmy
should
go
first
it
politeness
at
all
on
the
part
of
unc
billy
in
both
cases
it
was
a
kind
of
selfishness
each
was
thinking
of
self
how
long
they
would
have
continued
to
argue
and
try
to
appear
polite
if
something
had
happened
nobody
knows
but
something
did
happen
there
was
a
sudden
loud
sniff
just
around
the
corner
of
the
henhouse
it
was
from
bowser
the
hound
right
then
and
there
unc
billy
possum
and
jimmy
skunk
forgot
all
about
politeness
and
both
tried
to
get
through
that
hole
at
the
same
time
they
could
because
it
was
big
enough
but
they
tried
hard
bowser
sniffed
again
and
this
time
unc
billy
managed
to
squeeze
jimmy
aside
and
slip
through
jimmy
was
right
at
his
heels
xvii
jimmy
skunk
gets
a
bump
hardly
had
jimmy
skunk
entered
the
hole
under
farmer
brown
henhouse
following
close
on
the
heels
of
unc
billy
possum
than
along
came
bowser
the
hound
sniffing
and
sniffing
in
a
way
that
made
unc
billy
nervous
when
bowser
reached
that
hole
of
course
he
smelled
the
tracks
of
unc
billy
and
jimmy
and
right
away
he
became
excited
he
began
to
dig
goodness
how
he
did
make
the
dirt
fly
all
the
time
he
whined
with
eagerness
unc
billy
wasted
no
time
in
squeezing
through
a
hole
in
the
floor
way
over
in
one
corner
a
hole
that
farmer
brown
boy
had
intended
to
nail
a
board
over
long
before
unc
billy
knew
that
bowser
could
get
through
that
even
if
he
did
manage
to
dig
his
way
under
the
henhouse
once
through
that
and
fairly
in
the
henhouse
unc
billy
drew
a
long
breath
he
felt
safe
for
the
time
being
anyway
and
he
did
propose
to
worry
over
the
future
jimmy
skunk
hurried
after
unc
billy
it
was
fear
that
caused
jimmy
to
hurry
no
indeed
it
was
fear
he
had
been
startled
by
the
unexpectedness
of
bowser
appearance
it
was
this
that
had
caused
him
to
struggle
to
be
first
through
that
hole
under
the
henhouse
but
once
through
he
had
felt
a
bit
ashamed
that
he
had
been
so
undignified
he
was
afraid
of
bowser
he
was
sorely
tempted
to
turn
around
and
send
bowser
about
his
business
as
he
knew
he
very
well
could
but
he
thought
better
of
it
besides
unc
billy
was
already
through
that
hole
in
the
floor
and
jimmy
did
for
a
minute
forget
what
had
brought
him
there
he
had
come
for
eggs
and
so
had
unc
billy
it
would
never
do
to
let
unc
billy
be
alone
up
there
for
long
so
jimmy
skunk
did
what
he
very
seldom
does
hurried
yes
sir
he
hurried
after
unc
billy
possum
he
meant
to
make
sure
of
his
share
of
the
eggs
he
was
certain
were
up
there
there
was
a
row
of
nesting
boxes
along
one
side
close
to
the
floor
above
these
was
another
row
and
above
these
a
third
row
jimmy
climb
but
unc
billy
is
a
famous
climber
i
take
these
lower
nests
said
jimmy
and
lifted
his
tail
in
a
way
that
made
unc
billy
nervous
all
right
replied
unc
billy
promptly
all
right
brer
skunk
just
as
yo
say
with
this
unc
billy
scrambled
up
to
the
next
row
of
nests
jimmy
grinned
and
started
to
look
in
the
lower
nests
he
took
his
time
about
it
for
that
is
jimmy
way
there
was
nothing
in
the
first
one
and
nothing
in
the
second
one
and
nothing
in
the
third
one
this
was
disappointing
to
say
the
least
and
jimmy
began
to
move
a
little
faster
meanwhile
unc
billy
had
hurried
from
one
nest
to
another
in
the
second
row
with
no
better
success
by
the
time
jimmy
was
along
his
row
unc
billy
bad
begun
on
the
upper
row
and
the
only
eggs
he
had
found
were
hard
china
put
there
by
farmer
brown
boy
to
tempt
the
hens
to
lay
in
those
particular
nests
disappointment
was
making
unc
billy
lose
his
temper
each
time
he
peeped
in
a
nest
and
saw
one
of
those
china
eggs
he
hoped
it
was
a
real
egg
and
each
time
when
he
found
it
was
he
grew
angrier
at
last
he
so
lost
his
temper
that
when
he
found
another
of
those
eggs
he
angrily
kicked
it
out
of
the
nest
now
it
happened
that
jimmy
skunk
was
just
underneath
down
fell
that
hard
china
egg
squarely
on
jimmy
skunk
head
for
just
a
minute
jimmy
saw
stars
at
least
he
thought
he
did
then
he
saw
the
egg
and
knew
that
unc
billy
had
knocked
it
down
and
that
it
was
this
that
had
hit
him
jimmy
was
sore
at
heart
because
he
had
found
no
eggs
and
now
he
had
a
bump
on
the
head
that
also
was
sore
jimmy
skunk
lost
his
temper
a
thing
he
rarely
does
xviii
a
sad
sad
quarrel
jimmy
skunk
sat
on
the
floor
of
farmer
brown
henhouse
rubbing
his
head
and
glaring
up
at
the
upper
row
of
nests
with
eyes
red
with
anger
of
course
it
was
dark
in
the
henhouse
for
it
was
night
but
jimmy
can
see
in
the
dark
just
as
so
many
other
little
people
who
wear
fur
can
what
he
saw
was
the
anxious
looking
face
of
unc
billy
possum
staring
down
at
him
you
did
that
purposely
snapped
jimmy
you
did
that
purposely
and
you
need
tell
me
you
did
on
mah
honor
ah
did
protested
unc
billy
it
was
an
accident
just
a
sho
accident
and
ah
right
sorry
fo
it
that
sounds
very
nice
but
i
do
believe
a
word
of
it
you
did
it
purposely
and
you
ca
make
me
believe
anything
else
come
down
here
and
fight
i
dare
you
to
jimmy
was
getting
more
and
more
angry
every
minute
unc
billy
began
to
grow
angry
of
course
it
was
wholly
his
fault
that
that
egg
had
fallen
but
it
was
his
fault
that
jimmy
had
happened
to
be
just
beneath
he
had
known
that
jimmy
was
there
he
had
apologized
and
he
felt
that
no
one
could
do
more
than
that
jimmy
skunk
had
doubted
his
word
had
refused
to
believe
him
and
that
made
him
angry
his
little
eyes
glowed
with
rage
if
yo
want
to
fight
come
up
here
i
wait
fo
yo
right
where
ah
am
he
sputtered
this
made
jimmy
angrier
than
ever
he
could
climb
up
there
and
he
knew
that
unc
billy
knew
it
unc
billy
was
perfectly
safe
in
promising
to
wait
for
him
you
a
coward
just
a
plain
coward
snapped
jimmy
not
going
to
climb
up
there
but
i
tell
you
what
i
am
going
to
do
i
going
to
wait
right
down
here
until
you
come
down
if
it
is
until
next
year
nobody
can
drop
things
on
my
head
and
not
get
paid
back
i
thought
you
were
a
friend
but
now
i
know
better
wait
as
long
as
yo
please
ah
reckons
ah
can
stay
as
long
as
yo
can
retorted
unc
billy
grinding
and
snapping
his
teeth
suit
yourself
retorted
jimmy
i
going
to
pay
you
up
for
that
bump
on
my
head
or
know
the
reason
why
and
so
they
kept
on
quarreling
and
calling
each
other
names
for
the
time
being
quite
forgetting
that
they
were
where
they
had
no
business
to
be
either
of
them
it
really
was
dreadful
and
it
was
all
because
both
had
been
sadly
disappointed
they
had
found
no
eggs
where
they
had
been
sure
they
would
find
plenty
you
see
farmer
brown
boy
had
gathered
every
egg
when
he
shut
the
biddies
up
for
the
night
did
you
ever
notice
what
a
bad
thing
for
the
temper
disappointment
often
is
illustration
xix
jimmy
skunk
is
true
to
his
word
unc
billy
possum
was
having
a
bad
night
of
it
when
he
had
grown
tired
of
quarreling
with
jimmy
skunk
he
had
tried
to
take
a
nap
he
had
tried
first
one
nest
and
then
another
but
none
just
suited
him
this
was
partly
because
he
was
sleepy
he
was
hungry
and
not
at
all
sleepy
he
wished
with
all
his
heart
that
he
had
foolishly
yielded
to
that
fit
of
temper
which
had
resulted
in
kicking
that
china
out
of
a
nest
and
down
on
the
head
of
jimmy
skunk
making
jimmy
so
thoroughly
angry
unc
billy
had
no
intention
of
going
down
while
jimmy
was
there
he
thought
that
jimmy
would
soon
grow
tired
of
waiting
and
go
away
so
for
quite
awhile
unc
billy
did
worry
but
as
it
began
to
get
towards
morning
he
began
to
grow
anxious
unc
billy
had
no
desire
to
be
found
in
that
henhouse
when
farmer
brown
boy
came
to
feed
the
biddies
then
too
he
was
hungry
he
had
counted
on
a
good
meal
of
eggs
and
not
one
had
he
found
now
he
wanted
to
get
out
to
look
for
something
else
to
eat
but
he
could
without
facing
jimmy
skunk
and
it
was
better
to
go
hungry
than
to
do
that
yes
sir
it
was
a
great
deal
better
to
go
hungry
several
times
when
he
thought
jimmy
was
asleep
he
tried
to
steal
down
he
was
just
as
careful
not
to
make
a
sound
as
he
could
be
but
every
time
jimmy
knew
and
was
waiting
for
him
unc
billy
wished
that
there
was
no
such
place
as
farmer
brown
henhouse
he
wished
he
had
never
thought
of
eggs
he
wished
many
other
foolish
wishes
but
most
of
all
he
wished
that
he
had
lost
his
temper
and
kicked
that
egg
down
on
jimmy
skunk
head
when
the
first
light
stole
in
under
the
door
and
the
biddies
began
to
stir
uneasily
on
their
roosts
unc
billy
anxiety
would
allow
him
to
keep
still
no
longer
don
yo
think
better
make
up
and
get
out
of
here
brer
skunk
he
ventured
i
do
mind
staying
here
it
very
comfortable
replied
jimmy
looking
up
at
unc
billy
in
a
way
that
made
him
most
it
was
plain
to
see
that
jimmy
had
forgiven
him
for
some
time
unc
billy
said
no
more
but
he
grew
more
and
more
restless
you
see
he
knew
it
would
soon
be
time
for
farmer
brown
boy
to
come
to
let
the
hens
out
and
feed
them
at
last
he
ventured
to
speak
again
ah
reckons
yo
done
forget
something
said
he
what
is
that
asked
jimmy
ah
reckons
yo
done
that
it
most
time
fo
farmer
brown
boy
to
come
and
it
wo
do
fo
to
be
found
in
here
replied
billy
i
not
worrying
about
farmer
brown
boy
he
can
come
as
soon
as
he
pleases
retorted
jimmy
skunk
and
grinned
that
sounded
like
boasting
but
it
was
no
sir
it
was
and
billy
knew
it
he
knew
that
jimmy
meant
it
unc
billy
was
in
despair
he
did
dare
stay
and
he
did
dare
go
down
and
face
jimmy
skunk
and
there
he
was
it
certainly
had
been
a
bad
night
for
unc
billy
possum
xx
farmer
brown
boy
arrives
the
light
crept
farther
under
the
door
of
farmer
brown
henhouse
and
by
this
time
the
hens
were
all
awake
furthermore
they
had
discovered
jimmy
skunk
down
below
and
were
making
a
great
fuss
they
were
cackling
so
that
unc
billy
was
sure
farmer
brown
boy
would
soon
hear
them
and
hurry
out
to
find
out
what
the
noise
was
all
about
if
yo
would
just
get
out
of
sight
brer
skunk
ah
reckons
those
fool
hens
would
keep
quiet
unc
billy
ventured
i
do
mind
their
noise
it
does
trouble
me
a
bit
replied
jimmy
skunk
and
grinned
it
was
plain
enough
to
unc
billy
that
jimmy
was
enjoying
the
situation
but
unc
billy
was
he
was
so
anxious
that
he
could
keep
still
he
paced
back
and
forth
along
the
shelf
in
front
of
the
upper
row
of
nests
and
tried
to
make
up
his
mind
whether
it
would
be
better
to
go
down
and
face
jimmy
skunk
or
to
try
to
hide
under
the
hay
in
one
of
the
nests
and
all
the
time
he
kept
listening
and
listening
and
listening
for
the
footsteps
of
farmer
brown
boy
at
last
he
heard
them
and
he
knew
by
the
sound
that
farmer
brown
boy
was
coming
in
a
hurry
he
had
heard
the
noise
of
the
hens
and
was
coming
to
find
out
what
it
was
all
about
unc
billy
hoped
that
now
jimmy
skunk
would
retreat
through
the
hole
in
the
floor
and
give
him
a
chance
to
escape
he
coming
farmer
brown
boy
is
coming
brer
skunk
yo
better
get
away
while
yo
can
whispered
unc
billy
i
hear
him
replied
jimmy
calmly
i
waiting
for
him
to
open
the
door
for
me
to
go
out
it
will
be
much
easier
than
squeezing
through
that
hole
unc
billy
gasped
he
knew
of
course
that
it
was
jimmy
skunk
boast
that
he
feared
no
one
but
it
was
hard
to
believe
that
jimmy
really
intended
to
face
farmer
brown
boy
right
in
his
own
henhouse
where
jimmy
had
no
business
to
be
he
hoped
that
at
last
jimmy
boldness
would
get
him
into
trouble
yes
he
did
you
see
that
might
give
him
a
chance
to
slip
away
himself
otherwise
he
would
be
in
a
bad
fix
the
latch
on
the
door
rattled
unc
billy
crept
into
one
of
the
nests
but
frightened
as
he
was
he
could
keep
from
peeping
over
the
edge
to
see
what
would
happen
the
door
swung
open
letting
in
a
flood
of
light
the
hens
stopped
their
noise
farmer
brown
boy
stood
in
the
doorway
and
looked
in
jimmy
skunk
lifted
his
big
plume
of
a
tail
just
a
bit
higher
than
usual
and
calmly
and
without
the
least
sign
of
being
in
a
hurry
walked
straight
towards
the
open
door
of
course
farmer
boy
saw
him
at
once
so
it
you
you
black
and
white
rascal
he
exclaimed
i
suppose
you
expect
me
to
step
out
of
your
way
and
i
suppose
i
will
do
just
that
very
thing
you
are
the
most
impudent
and
independent
fellow
of
my
acquaintance
that
what
you
are
you
did
get
any
eggs
because
i
gathered
all
of
them
last
night
and
you
did
get
a
chicken
because
they
were
wise
enough
to
stay
on
their
roosts
so
i
do
know
as
i
have
any
quarrel
with
you
and
i
sure
i
do
want
any
come
along
out
of
there
you
rascal
farmer
brown
boy
stepped
aside
and
jimmy
skunk
calmly
and
without
the
least
sign
of
hurry
or
worry
walked
out
stopped
for
a
drink
at
the
pan
of
water
in
the
henyard
walked
through
the
henyard
gate
and
turned
towards
the
stone
wall
along
the
edge
of
the
old
orchard
xxi
the
gives
unc
billy
away
is
little
things
that
often
seem
scarce
worth
a
passing
thought
which
in
the
end
may
prove
that
they
with
big
results
are
fraught
farmer
brown
boy
watched
jimmy
skunk
calmly
and
peacefully
go
his
way
and
grinned
as
he
watched
him
he
scratched
his
head
thoughtfully
i
suppose
said
he
that
that
is
as
perfect
an
example
of
the
value
of
preparedness
as
there
is
jimmy
knew
he
was
all
ready
for
trouble
if
i
chose
to
make
it
and
that
because
of
that
i
would
make
it
so
he
has
calmly
gone
his
way
as
if
he
were
as
much
bigger
than
i
as
i
am
bigger
than
he
there
certainly
is
nothing
like
being
prepared
if
you
want
to
avoid
trouble
then
farmer
brown
boy
once
more
turned
to
the
henhouse
and
entered
it
he
looked
to
make
sure
that
no
hen
had
been
foolish
enough
to
go
to
sleep
where
jimmy
could
have
caught
her
and
satisfied
of
this
he
would
have
gone
about
his
usual
morning
work
of
feeding
the
hens
but
for
one
thing
that
one
thing
was
the
china
on
the
floor
hello
exclaimed
farmer
brown
boy
when
he
saw
it
now
how
did
that
come
there
it
must
be
that
jimmy
skunk
pulled
it
out
of
one
of
those
lower
nests
now
he
knew
just
which
nests
had
contained
and
it
did
take
but
a
minute
to
find
that
none
was
missing
in
any
of
the
lower
nests
that
queer
he
muttered
that
egg
must
have
come
from
one
of
the
upper
nests
jimmy
could
have
got
up
to
those
none
of
the
hens
could
have
kicked
it
out
last
night
because
they
were
all
on
the
roosts
when
i
shut
them
up
they
certainly
did
do
it
this
morning
because
they
would
have
dared
leave
the
roosts
with
jimmy
skunk
here
i
have
to
look
into
this
so
he
began
with
the
second
row
of
nests
and
looked
in
each
then
he
started
on
the
upper
row
and
so
he
came
to
the
nest
in
which
unc
billy
possum
was
hiding
under
the
hay
and
holding
his
breath
now
unc
billy
had
covered
himself
up
pretty
well
with
the
hay
but
he
had
forgotten
one
thing
he
had
forgotten
his
tail
yes
sir
unc
billy
had
forgotten
his
tail
and
it
hung
just
over
the
edge
of
the
nest
of
course
farmer
brown
boy
saw
it
he
could
help
but
see
it
ho
ho
he
exclaimed
right
away
ho
ho
so
there
was
more
than
one
visitor
here
last
night
this
henhouse
seems
to
be
a
very
popular
place
i
see
that
the
first
thing
for
me
to
do
after
breakfast
is
to
nail
a
board
over
that
hole
in
the
floor
so
it
was
you
unc
billy
possum
who
kicked
that
out
found
it
a
little
hard
for
your
teeth
you
lost
your
temper
and
kicked
it
out
did
you
that
was
foolish
unc
billy
very
foolish
indeed
never
lose
your
temper
over
trifles
it
does
pay
now
i
wonder
what
i
better
do
with
you
all
this
time
unc
billy
had
moved
of
course
he
could
understand
what
farmer
brown
boy
was
saying
nor
could
he
see
what
farmer
boy
was
doing
so
he
held
his
breath
and
hoped
and
hoped
that
he
been
discovered
and
perhaps
he
would
have
been
but
for
that
telltale
on
the
floor
that
was
the
cause
of
all
his
troubles
first
it
had
angered
jimmy
skunk
because
as
you
remember
it
had
fallen
on
jimmy
head
then
it
had
led
farmer
brown
boy
to
look
in
all
the
nests
it
had
seemed
a
trifle
kicking
that
egg
out
of
that
nest
but
see
what
the
results
were
truly
little
things
often
are
not
so
little
as
they
seem
illustration
xxii
unc
billy
possum
tries
his
old
trick
the
first
knowledge
unc
billy
possum
had
that
he
was
discovered
came
to
him
through
his
tail
yes
sir
it
came
to
him
through
his
tail
farmer
brown
boy
pinched
it
it
was
rather
a
mean
thing
to
do
but
farmer
brown
boy
was
curious
he
wanted
to
see
what
unc
billy
would
do
and
he
did
pinch
very
hard
not
hard
enough
to
really
hurt
farmer
brown
boy
is
too
to
hurt
any
one
if
he
can
help
it
now
any
other
of
the
green
forest
and
green
meadows
people
would
promptly
have
pulled
their
tail
away
had
they
been
in
unc
place
but
unc
billy
did
no
sir
unc
billy
did
that
tail
might
have
belonged
to
any
one
but
him
so
far
as
he
made
any
sign
of
course
he
felt
like
pulling
it
away
any
one
would
have
in
his
place
but
he
did
move
it
the
tiniest
bit
which
goes
to
show
that
billy
has
great
when
he
wishes
farmer
brown
boy
pinched
again
just
a
little
harder
but
still
billy
made
no
sign
farmer
brown
boy
chuckled
and
began
to
pull
on
that
tail
he
pulled
and
pulled
until
finally
he
had
pulled
unc
billy
out
of
his
and
he
swung
by
his
tail
from
the
hand
of
farmer
brown
boy
there
was
the
least
sign
of
life
about
billy
he
looked
as
if
he
were
dead
and
he
acted
as
if
he
were
dead
any
one
not
knowing
unc
billy
would
have
supposed
that
he
dead
farmer
brown
boy
dropped
unc
billy
on
the
floor
he
lay
just
as
he
fell
farmer
brown
boy
rolled
him
over
with
his
foot
but
there
a
sign
of
life
in
unc
billy
he
hoped
that
farmer
brown
boy
really
did
think
him
dead
that
was
what
he
wanted
farmer
brown
boy
picked
him
up
again
and
laid
him
on
a
box
first
putting
a
board
over
the
hole
in
the
floor
and
closing
the
henhouse
door
then
he
went
about
his
work
of
cleaning
out
the
henhouse
and
measuring
out
the
grain
for
the
biddies
unc
billy
lay
there
on
the
box
and
he
certainly
was
pathetic
looking
a
dead
animal
or
bird
is
always
pathetic
looking
and
none
was
ever
more
so
than
unc
billy
possum
as
he
lay
on
that
box
his
hair
was
all
rumpled
up
as
it
usually
is
it
was
filled
with
dust
from
the
floor
and
bits
of
straw
his
lips
were
drawn
back
and
his
mouth
partly
open
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
closed
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
were
open
just
a
teeny
weeny
bit
just
enough
for
unc
billy
to
watch
farmer
boy
but
to
have
looked
at
him
you
would
have
thought
him
as
dead
as
the
deadest
thing
that
ever
was
as
he
went
about
his
work
farmer
brown
boy
kept
an
eye
on
unc
billy
and
chuckled
you
old
fraud
said
he
you
think
you
are
fooling
me
but
i
know
you
possums
do
die
of
nothing
in
hens
nests
you
certainly
are
a
clever
old
rascal
and
the
best
actor
i
ever
seen
i
wonder
how
long
you
will
keep
it
up
i
wish
i
had
half
as
much
when
he
had
finished
his
work
he
picked
unc
billy
up
by
the
tail
once
more
opened
the
door
and
started
for
the
house
with
unc
billy
swinging
from
his
hand
and
bumping
against
his
legs
still
unc
billy
gave
no
sign
of
life
he
wondered
where
he
was
being
taken
to
he
was
terribly
frightened
but
he
stuck
to
his
old
trick
of
playing
dead
which
had
served
him
so
well
more
than
once
before
illustration
xxiii
unc
billy
gives
himself
away
never
had
unc
billy
possum
played
that
old
trick
of
his
better
than
he
was
playing
it
now
farmer
brown
boy
knew
that
unc
billy
was
only
pretending
to
be
dead
yet
so
well
did
unc
billy
pretend
that
it
was
hard
work
for
farmer
brown
boy
to
believe
what
he
knew
was
the
truth
that
unc
billy
was
very
much
alive
and
only
waiting
for
a
chance
to
slip
away
they
were
from
the
henyard
to
the
house
when
bowser
the
hound
came
to
meet
his
master
now
we
shall
see
what
we
shall
see
said
farmer
brown
boy
as
bowser
came
trotting
up
if
unc
billy
can
stand
this
test
i
take
off
my
hat
to
him
every
time
we
meet
hereafter
he
held
unc
billy
out
to
bowser
and
bowser
sniffed
him
all
over
just
imagine
that
just
think
of
being
nosed
and
sniffed
at
by
one
of
whom
you
were
terribly
afraid
and
not
so
much
as
twitching
an
ear
farmer
brown
boy
dropped
unc
billy
on
the
ground
and
bowser
rolled
him
over
and
sniffed
at
him
and
then
looked
up
at
his
master
as
much
as
to
say
this
fellow
does
interest
me
he
dead
he
must
be
the
fellow
i
saw
go
under
the
henhouse
last
night
how
did
you
kill
him
farmer
brown
boy
laughed
and
picked
unc
billy
up
by
the
tail
again
he
fooled
you
all
right
old
fellow
and
you
do
know
it
said
he
to
bowser
as
the
latter
pranced
on
ahead
to
the
house
the
mother
of
farmer
brown
boy
was
in
the
doorway
watching
them
approach
what
have
you
got
there
she
demanded
i
declare
if
it
is
a
possum
where
did
you
kill
him
was
he
the
cause
of
all
that
racket
among
the
chickens
farmer
brown
boy
took
unc
billy
into
the
kitchen
and
dropped
him
on
a
chair
brown
came
over
to
look
at
him
closer
poor
little
fellow
said
she
poor
little
fellow
it
was
too
bad
he
got
into
mischief
and
had
to
be
killed
i
do
suppose
he
knew
any
better
somehow
it
always
seems
wrong
to
me
to
kill
these
little
creatures
just
because
they
get
into
mischief
when
all
the
time
they
do
know
that
they
are
in
mischief
she
stroked
unc
billy
gently
the
eyes
of
farmer
brown
boy
twinkled
he
went
over
to
a
corner
and
pulled
a
straw
from
his
mother
broom
then
he
returned
to
unc
billy
and
began
to
tickle
unc
billy
nose
brown
looked
puzzled
she
was
puzzled
what
are
you
doing
that
for
she
asked
just
for
fun
replied
farmer
brown
boy
and
kept
on
tickling
billy
nose
now
unc
billy
could
stand
having
his
tail
pinched
and
being
carried
head
down
and
being
dropped
on
the
ground
but
this
was
too
much
for
him
he
wanted
to
sneeze
he
had
to
sneeze
he
did
sneeze
he
could
help
it
though
it
were
to
cost
him
his
life
land
of
love
exclaimed
brown
jumping
back
and
clutching
her
skirts
in
both
hands
as
if
she
expected
unc
billy
would
try
to
take
refuge
behind
them
do
you
mean
to
say
that
that
possum
is
alive
seems
that
way
replied
farmer
brown
boy
as
unc
billy
sneezed
again
for
that
straw
was
still
tickling
his
nose
i
should
certainly
say
it
seems
that
way
the
old
sinner
is
no
more
dead
than
i
am
just
pretending
he
fooled
you
all
right
mother
but
he
did
fool
me
i
have
hurt
a
hair
of
him
you
ought
to
know
me
well
enough
by
this
time
to
know
that
i
would
hurt
him
he
looked
at
his
mother
reproachfully
and
she
hastened
to
apologize
but
what
could
i
think
she
demanded
if
he
is
a
creature
i
never
have
seen
one
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
him
son
take
him
over
to
the
green
forest
after
breakfast
and
let
him
go
replied
farmer
brown
boy
this
is
just
what
he
did
do
and
unc
billy
wasted
no
time
in
getting
home
it
was
a
long
time
before
he
met
jimmy
skunk
again
when
he
did
jimmy
was
his
usual
self
and
unc
billy
was
wise
enough
not
to
refer
to
eggs
