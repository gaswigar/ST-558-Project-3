proofreading
team
the
cinema
murder
by
phillips
oppenheim
book
i
chapter
i
with
a
somewhat
prolonged
grinding
of
the
brakes
and
an
unnecessary
amount
of
fuss
in
the
way
of
letting
off
steam
the
afternoon
train
from
london
came
to
a
standstill
in
the
station
at
detton
magna
an
elderly
porter
putting
on
his
coat
as
he
came
issued
with
the
dogged
aid
of
one
bound
by
custom
to
perform
a
hopeless
mission
from
the
small
redbrick
lamp
room
the
station
master
occupying
a
position
of
vantage
in
front
of
the
shed
which
enclosed
the
booking
office
looked
up
and
down
the
lifeless
row
of
closed
and
streaming
windows
with
an
expectancy
dulled
by
daily
disappointment
for
the
passengers
who
seldom
alighted
on
this
occasion
no
records
were
broken
a
solitary
young
man
stepped
out
on
to
the
wet
and
flinty
platform
handed
over
the
half
of
a
return
ticket
from
london
passed
through
the
two
open
doors
and
commenced
to
climb
the
long
ascent
which
led
into
the
town
he
wore
no
overcoat
and
for
protection
against
the
inclement
weather
he
was
able
only
to
turn
up
the
collar
of
his
blue
serge
coat
the
damp
of
a
ceaselessly
wet
day
seemed
to
have
laid
its
cheerless
pall
upon
the
whole
exceedingly
ugly
landscape
the
hedges
blackened
with
smuts
from
the
colliery
on
the
other
side
of
the
slope
were
dripping
also
with
raindrops
the
road
flinty
and
light
grey
in
colour
was
greasy
with
mud
there
were
puddles
even
in
the
pathway
which
he
trod
on
either
side
of
him
stretched
the
shrunken
fields
of
an
industrial
neighbourhood
the
which
stretched
up
the
hillside
before
him
presented
scarcely
a
single
redeeming
feature
the
small
grey
stone
houses
hard
and
unadorned
were
interrupted
at
intervals
by
rows
of
cottages
in
the
background
were
the
tall
chimneys
of
several
factories
on
the
left
a
colliery
shaft
raised
its
finger
to
the
lowering
clouds
after
his
first
glance
around
at
these
familiar
and
unlovely
objects
philip
romilly
walked
with
his
head
a
little
thrown
back
his
eyes
lifted
as
though
with
intent
to
the
melancholy
and
watery
skies
he
was
a
young
man
well
above
medium
height
slim
almost
inclined
to
be
angular
yet
with
a
good
carriage
notwithstanding
a
stoop
which
seemed
more
the
result
of
an
habitual
depression
than
occasioned
by
any
physical
weakness
his
features
were
large
his
mouth
querulous
a
little
discontented
his
eyes
filled
with
the
light
of
a
silent
and
rebellious
bitterness
which
seemed
somehow
to
have
found
a
more
or
less
permanent
abode
in
his
face
his
clothes
although
they
were
neat
had
seen
better
days
he
was
ungloved
and
he
carried
under
his
arm
a
small
parcel
which
appeared
to
contain
a
book
carefully
done
up
in
brown
paper
as
he
reached
the
outskirts
of
the
village
he
slackened
his
pace
standing
a
little
way
back
from
the
road
from
which
they
were
separated
by
an
ugly
gravelled
playground
were
the
familiar
school
buildings
with
the
usual
inscription
carved
in
stone
above
the
door
he
laid
his
hand
upon
the
wooden
gate
and
paused
from
inside
he
could
catch
the
drone
of
children
voices
he
glanced
at
his
watch
it
was
barely
twenty
minutes
past
four
for
a
moment
he
hesitated
then
he
strolled
on
and
turning
at
the
gate
of
an
adjoining
cottage
the
nearest
to
the
schools
of
a
little
unlovely
row
he
tried
the
latch
found
it
yield
to
his
touch
and
stepped
inside
he
closed
the
door
behind
him
and
turned
with
a
little
weary
sigh
of
content
towards
a
large
drawn
up
in
front
of
the
fire
for
a
single
moment
he
seemed
about
to
throw
himself
into
its
depths
his
long
fingers
indeed
a
little
blue
with
the
cold
seemed
already
on
their
way
towards
the
genial
warmth
of
the
flames
then
he
stopped
short
he
stood
perfectly
still
in
an
attitude
of
arrested
motion
his
eyes
wonderingly
at
first
and
then
with
a
strange
unanalysable
expression
seeming
to
embark
upon
a
lengthened
a
scrupulous
an
almost
horrified
estimate
of
his
surroundings
to
the
ordinary
observer
there
would
have
been
nothing
remarkable
in
the
appearance
of
the
little
room
save
its
entirely
unexpected
air
of
luxury
and
refinement
there
was
a
small
chippendale
sideboard
against
the
wall
a
round
table
on
which
stood
a
blue
china
bowl
filled
with
pink
roses
a
couple
of
luxurious
some
old
prints
upon
the
wall
on
the
sideboard
was
a
basket
as
yet
unpacked
filled
with
hothouse
fruit
and
on
a
low
settee
by
the
side
of
one
of
the
were
a
little
pile
of
reviews
several
volumes
of
poetry
and
a
couple
of
library
books
in
the
centre
of
the
mantelpiece
was
a
photograph
the
photograph
of
a
man
a
little
older
perhaps
than
this
visitor
with
rounder
face
dressed
in
country
tweeds
a
flower
in
his
buttonhole
the
picture
of
a
prosperous
man
yet
with
a
curious
almost
disturbing
likeness
to
the
pale
youth
whose
eye
had
been
attracted
by
its
presence
and
who
was
gazing
at
it
spellbound
douglas
he
muttered
douglas
he
flung
his
hat
upon
the
table
and
for
a
moment
his
hand
rested
upon
his
forehead
he
was
confronted
with
a
mystery
which
baffled
him
a
mystery
whose
sinister
possibilities
were
slowly
framing
themselves
in
his
mind
while
he
stood
there
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
the
sound
of
the
opening
gate
brisk
footsteps
up
the
tiled
way
the
soft
swirl
of
a
woman
skirt
the
latch
was
raised
the
door
opened
and
closed
the
newcomer
stood
upon
the
threshold
gazing
at
him
philip
she
exclaimed
why
philip
there
was
a
curious
change
in
the
girl
tone
from
almost
glad
welcome
to
a
note
of
abrupt
fear
in
that
last
pronouncement
of
his
name
she
stood
looking
at
him
the
victim
apparently
of
so
many
emotions
that
there
was
nothing
definite
to
be
drawn
either
from
her
tone
or
expression
she
was
a
young
woman
of
medium
height
and
slim
delicate
figure
attractive
with
large
discontented
mouth
full
clear
eyes
and
a
wealth
of
dark
brown
hair
she
was
very
simply
dressed
and
yet
in
a
manner
which
scarcely
suggested
the
to
the
man
who
confronted
her
his
left
hand
gripping
the
mantelpiece
his
eyes
filled
with
a
flaming
jealousy
there
was
something
entirely
new
in
the
hang
of
her
skirt
the
soft
colouring
of
her
blouse
the
greater
animation
of
her
piquant
face
with
its
somewhat
dazzling
complexion
his
hand
flashed
out
towards
her
as
he
asked
his
question
what
does
it
mean
beatrice
she
showed
signs
of
recovering
herself
with
a
little
shrug
of
the
shoulders
she
turned
towards
the
door
which
led
into
an
inner
room
let
me
get
you
some
tea
philip
she
begged
you
look
so
cold
and
wet
stay
here
please
he
insisted
she
paused
reluctantly
there
was
a
curious
lack
of
anything
peremptory
in
his
manner
yet
somehow
although
she
would
have
given
the
world
to
have
passed
for
a
few
moments
into
the
shelter
of
the
little
kitchen
beyond
she
was
impelled
to
do
as
he
bade
her
do
be
silly
philip
she
said
petulantly
you
know
you
want
some
tea
and
so
do
i
sit
down
please
and
make
yourself
comfortable
why
did
you
let
me
know
you
were
coming
perhaps
it
would
have
been
better
he
agreed
quietly
however
since
i
am
here
answer
my
question
she
drew
a
little
breath
after
all
although
she
was
lacking
in
any
real
strength
of
character
she
was
filled
with
a
certain
compensatory
doggedness
his
challenge
was
there
to
be
faced
there
was
no
way
out
of
it
she
would
have
lied
willingly
enough
but
for
the
sheer
futility
of
falsehood
she
commenced
the
task
of
bracing
herself
for
the
struggle
you
had
better
she
said
frame
your
question
a
little
more
exactly
i
will
then
try
to
answer
it
he
was
stung
by
her
altered
demeanour
embarrassed
by
an
avalanche
of
words
a
hundred
questions
were
burning
upon
his
lips
it
was
by
a
great
effort
of
that
he
remained
coherent
the
last
time
i
visited
you
he
began
was
three
months
ago
your
cottage
then
was
furnished
as
one
would
expect
it
to
be
furnished
you
had
a
deal
dresser
a
deal
table
one
rather
hard
and
a
very
old
wicker
one
you
had
if
i
remember
rightly
a
strip
of
linoleum
upon
the
floor
and
a
single
rug
your
flowers
were
from
the
hedges
and
your
fruit
from
the
one
apple
tree
in
the
garden
behind
your
clothes
am
i
mistaken
about
your
clothes
or
are
you
dressed
more
expensively
i
am
dressed
more
expensively
she
admitted
you
and
i
both
know
the
value
of
these
things
he
went
on
with
a
little
sweep
of
the
hand
we
know
the
value
of
them
because
we
were
once
accustomed
to
them
because
we
have
both
since
experienced
the
passionate
craving
for
them
or
the
things
they
represent
chippendale
furniture
a
turkey
carpet
roses
in
january
hothouse
fruit
bartolozzi
prints
do
not
march
with
an
income
of
fifty
pounds
a
year
they
do
not
she
assented
equably
all
the
things
which
you
see
here
and
which
you
have
mentioned
are
presents
his
forefinger
shot
out
with
a
sudden
vigour
towards
the
photograph
from
him
from
douglas
she
admitted
from
your
cousin
he
took
the
photograph
into
his
hand
looked
at
it
for
a
moment
and
dashed
it
into
the
grate
the
glass
of
the
frame
was
shivered
into
a
hundred
pieces
the
girl
only
shrugged
her
shoulders
she
was
holding
herself
in
reserve
as
for
him
his
eyes
were
hot
there
was
a
dry
choking
in
his
throat
he
had
passed
through
many
weary
and
depressed
days
struggling
always
against
the
grinding
monotony
of
life
and
his
surroundings
now
for
the
first
time
he
felt
that
there
was
something
worse
what
does
it
mean
he
asked
once
more
she
seemed
almost
to
dilate
as
she
answered
him
her
feet
were
firmly
planted
upon
the
ground
there
was
a
new
look
in
her
face
a
look
of
decision
she
was
more
or
less
a
coward
but
she
felt
no
fear
she
even
leaned
a
little
towards
him
and
looked
him
in
the
face
it
means
she
pronounced
slowly
exactly
what
it
seems
to
mean
the
words
conveyed
horrible
things
to
him
but
he
was
speechless
he
could
only
wait
you
and
i
philip
she
continued
have
been
well
i
suppose
we
should
call
it
engaged
for
three
years
during
those
three
years
i
have
earned
by
disgusting
and
wearisome
labour
just
enough
to
keep
me
alive
in
a
world
which
has
had
nothing
to
offer
me
but
ugliness
and
discomfort
and
misery
you
as
you
admitted
last
time
we
met
have
done
no
better
you
have
lived
in
a
garret
and
gone
often
hungry
to
bed
for
three
years
this
has
been
going
on
all
that
time
i
have
waited
for
you
to
bring
something
human
something
reasonable
something
warm
into
my
life
and
you
have
failed
i
have
passed
in
those
three
years
from
to
in
three
more
i
shall
be
in
my
thirtieth
year
that
is
to
say
the
best
time
of
my
life
will
have
passed
you
see
i
have
been
thinking
and
i
have
had
enough
he
stood
quite
dumb
the
girl
personality
seemed
to
fill
the
room
he
felt
crowded
out
she
was
at
that
stage
absolutely
mistress
of
the
situation
she
passed
him
carelessly
by
flung
herself
into
the
and
crossed
her
legs
as
though
he
were
looking
at
some
person
in
another
world
he
realized
that
she
was
wearing
shoes
of
shapely
cut
and
silk
stockings
our
engagement
she
went
on
was
at
first
the
dearest
thing
in
life
to
me
it
could
have
been
the
most
wonderful
thing
in
life
i
am
only
an
ordinary
person
with
an
ordinary
character
but
i
have
the
capacity
to
love
unselfishly
and
i
am
at
heart
as
faithful
and
as
good
as
any
other
woman
but
there
is
my
birthright
i
have
had
three
years
of
sordid
and
utterly
miserable
life
teaching
squalid
dirty
unlovable
children
things
they
had
much
better
not
know
i
have
lived
here
here
in
detton
magna
among
the
smuts
and
the
mists
where
the
flowers
seem
withered
and
even
the
meadows
are
stony
where
the
people
are
hard
and
coarse
as
their
ugly
houses
where
virtue
is
ugly
and
vice
is
ugly
and
living
is
ugly
and
death
is
fearsome
and
now
you
see
what
i
have
chosen
not
in
a
moment
folly
mind
because
i
am
not
foolish
not
in
a
passion
either
because
until
now
the
only
real
feeling
i
have
had
in
life
was
for
you
but
i
have
chosen
and
i
hold
to
my
choice
they
wo
let
you
stay
here
he
muttered
they
need
she
answered
calmly
there
are
other
ways
in
which
i
can
at
least
earn
as
much
as
the
miserable
pittance
doled
out
to
me
here
i
have
avoided
even
considering
them
before
shall
i
tell
you
why
because
i
did
want
to
face
the
temptation
they
might
bring
with
them
i
always
knew
what
would
happen
if
escape
became
hopeless
it
the
ugliness
i
ca
stand
the
ugliness
of
cheap
food
cheap
clothes
uncomfortable
furniture
coarse
voices
coarse
friends
if
i
would
have
them
how
do
you
suppose
i
have
lived
here
these
last
three
years
a
teacher
in
the
national
schools
look
up
and
down
this
long
dreary
street
at
the
names
above
the
shops
at
the
villas
in
which
the
tradespeople
live
and
ask
yourself
where
my
friends
were
to
come
from
the
clergyman
perhaps
he
is
over
seventy
a
widower
and
he
never
comes
near
the
place
why
have
been
content
to
have
been
patronized
if
there
had
been
anyone
here
to
do
it
who
wore
the
right
sort
of
clothes
and
said
the
right
sort
of
thing
in
the
right
tone
but
the
others
well
that
done
with
he
remained
curiously
dumb
his
eyes
were
fixed
upon
the
fragments
of
the
photograph
in
the
grate
in
a
corner
of
the
room
an
clock
ticked
wheezily
a
lump
of
coal
fell
out
on
the
hearth
which
she
replaced
mechanically
with
her
foot
his
silence
seemed
to
irritate
and
perplex
her
she
looked
away
from
him
drew
her
chair
a
little
closer
to
the
fire
and
sat
with
her
head
resting
upon
her
hands
her
tone
had
become
almost
meditative
i
knew
that
this
would
come
one
day
she
went
on
why
do
you
speak
and
get
it
over
are
you
waiting
to
clothe
your
phrases
are
you
afraid
of
the
naked
words
i
not
let
me
hear
them
do
be
more
melodramatic
than
you
can
help
because
as
you
know
i
am
cursed
with
a
sense
of
humour
but
do
stand
there
saying
nothing
he
raised
his
eyes
and
looked
at
her
in
silence
an
alternative
which
she
found
it
hard
to
endure
then
after
a
moment
shivering
recoil
into
her
chair
she
sprang
to
her
feet
listen
she
cried
passionately
i
do
care
what
you
think
i
tell
you
that
if
you
were
really
a
man
if
you
had
a
man
heart
in
your
body
you
have
sinned
yourself
before
now
robbed
some
one
murdered
them
torn
the
things
that
make
life
from
the
fate
that
refuses
to
give
them
what
is
it
they
pay
you
she
went
on
contemptuously
at
that
miserable
art
school
of
yours
sixty
pounds
a
year
how
much
do
you
get
to
eat
and
drink
out
of
that
what
sort
of
clothes
have
you
to
wear
are
you
content
yet
even
you
have
been
better
off
than
i
you
have
always
your
chance
your
play
may
be
accepted
or
your
stories
published
i
even
had
that
forlorn
hope
but
even
you
philip
may
wait
too
long
there
are
too
many
laws
nowadays
for
life
to
be
lived
naturally
if
i
were
a
man
a
man
like
you
i
break
them
her
taunts
apparently
moved
him
no
more
than
the
inner
tragedy
which
her
words
had
revealed
he
did
not
for
one
moment
give
any
sign
of
abandoning
the
unnatural
calm
which
seemed
to
have
descended
upon
him
he
took
up
his
hat
from
the
table
and
thrust
the
little
brown
paper
parcel
which
he
had
been
carrying
into
his
pocket
his
eyes
for
a
single
moment
met
the
challenge
of
hers
and
again
she
was
conscious
of
some
nameless
inexplicable
fear
perhaps
he
said
as
he
turned
away
i
may
do
that
his
hand
was
upon
the
latch
before
she
realized
that
he
was
actually
going
she
sprang
to
her
feet
abuse
scorn
upbraidings
even
violence
she
had
been
prepared
for
all
of
these
there
was
something
about
this
however
this
strange
brooding
silence
which
terrified
her
more
than
anything
she
could
have
imagined
philip
she
shrieked
you
not
going
you
not
going
like
this
you
have
said
anything
he
closed
the
door
with
firm
fingers
her
knees
trembled
she
was
conscious
of
an
unexpected
weakness
she
abandoned
her
first
intention
of
following
him
and
stood
before
the
window
holding
tightly
to
the
sash
he
had
reached
the
gate
now
and
paused
for
a
moment
looking
up
the
long
windy
street
then
he
crossed
to
the
other
side
of
the
road
stepped
over
a
stile
and
disappeared
walking
without
haste
with
firm
footsteps
along
a
cindered
path
which
bordered
the
canal
he
had
come
and
gone
and
she
knew
what
fear
was
chapter
ii
the
railway
station
at
detton
magna
presented
if
possible
an
even
more
dreary
appearance
than
earlier
in
the
day
as
the
time
drew
near
that
night
for
the
departure
of
the
last
train
northwards
its
long
strip
of
flinty
platform
was
utterly
deserted
around
the
three
flickering
the
drizzling
rain
fell
continuously
the
weary
porter
came
yawning
out
of
his
lamp
room
into
the
booking
office
where
the
station
master
sat
alone
his
chair
turned
away
from
the
open
wicket
window
to
the
smouldering
embers
of
the
smoky
fire
no
passengers
seemingly
the
latter
remarked
to
his
subordinate
not
a
sign
of
one
was
the
reply
that
young
chap
who
came
down
from
london
on
a
return
excursion
has
gone
back
either
do
his
ticket
in
the
outside
door
was
suddenly
opened
and
closed
the
sound
of
footsteps
approaching
the
ticket
window
was
heard
a
long
white
hand
was
thrust
through
the
aperture
a
voice
was
heard
from
the
invisible
outside
third
to
detton
junction
please
the
took
the
ticket
from
a
little
rack
received
the
exact
sum
he
demanded
swept
it
into
the
till
and
resumed
his
place
before
the
fire
the
porter
with
the
lamp
in
his
hand
lounged
out
into
the
the
prospective
passenger
however
was
nowhere
in
sight
he
looked
back
into
the
office
was
that
jim
spender
going
up
to
see
his
barmaid
again
he
asked
his
superior
the
station
master
yawned
drowsily
did
notice
he
answered
what
an
old
woman
you
getting
george
want
to
know
everybody
business
do
you
the
porter
withdrew
a
little
huffed
when
a
few
minutes
later
the
train
drew
in
he
even
avoided
ostentatiously
a
journey
to
the
far
end
of
the
platform
to
open
the
door
for
the
solitary
passenger
who
was
standing
there
he
passed
up
the
train
and
slammed
the
door
without
even
glancing
in
at
the
window
then
he
stood
and
watched
the
red
lights
disappear
was
it
jim
the
station
master
asked
him
on
their
way
out
did
notice
his
subordinate
replied
a
little
curtly
maybe
it
was
and
maybe
it
was
good
night
philip
romilly
sat
back
in
the
corner
of
his
empty
carriage
peering
out
of
the
window
in
which
he
could
see
only
the
reflection
of
the
feeble
there
was
no
doubt
about
it
however
they
were
moving
the
first
stage
of
his
journey
had
commenced
the
blessed
sense
of
motion
after
so
long
waiting
at
first
soothed
and
then
exhilarated
him
in
a
few
moments
he
became
restless
he
let
down
the
window
and
leaned
out
the
cool
dampness
of
the
night
was
immensely
refreshing
the
rain
softened
his
hot
cheeks
he
sat
there
peering
away
into
the
shadows
struggling
for
the
sight
of
definite
objects
a
tree
a
house
the
outline
of
a
field
anything
to
keep
the
other
thoughts
away
the
thoughts
that
came
sometimes
like
the
aftermath
of
a
grisly
unrealisable
nightmare
then
he
felt
chilly
drew
up
the
window
thrust
his
hands
into
his
pockets
from
which
he
drew
out
a
handsome
cigarette
case
struck
a
match
and
smoked
with
vivid
appreciation
of
the
quality
of
the
tobacco
examined
the
crest
on
the
case
as
he
put
it
away
and
finally
patted
with
surreptitious
eagerness
the
flat
morocco
letter
case
in
his
inside
pocket
at
the
junction
he
made
his
way
into
the
refreshment
room
and
ordered
a
long
whisky
and
soda
which
he
drank
in
a
couple
of
gulps
then
he
hastened
to
the
booking
office
and
took
a
ticket
to
liverpool
and
a
few
minutes
later
secured
a
seat
in
the
long
express
which
came
gliding
up
to
the
side
of
the
platform
he
spent
some
time
in
the
lavatory
washing
arranging
his
hair
straightening
his
tie
after
which
he
made
his
way
into
the
elaborate
and
found
a
comfortable
corner
seat
the
luxury
of
his
surroundings
soothed
his
jagged
nerves
the
car
was
comfortably
warmed
the
electric
light
upon
his
table
was
softly
shaded
the
steward
who
waited
upon
him
was
and
obsequious
and
seemed
entirely
oblivious
of
philip
shabby
clothes
he
ordered
champagne
a
little
vaguely
and
the
wine
ran
through
his
veins
with
a
curious
potency
he
ate
and
drank
now
and
then
mechanically
now
and
then
with
the
keenest
appetite
afterwards
he
smoked
a
cigar
drank
coffee
and
sipped
a
liqueur
with
the
appreciation
of
a
connoisseur
a
fellow
passenger
passed
him
an
evening
paper
which
he
glanced
through
with
apparent
interest
before
he
reached
his
journey
end
he
had
ordered
and
drunk
another
liqueur
he
tipped
the
steward
handsomely
it
was
the
first
meal
which
he
had
eaten
for
many
months
arrived
at
liverpool
he
entered
a
cab
and
drove
to
the
adelphi
hotel
he
made
his
way
at
once
to
the
office
his
clothes
were
dry
now
and
the
rest
and
warmth
had
given
him
more
confidence
you
have
a
room
engaged
for
me
i
think
he
said
douglas
romilly
i
sent
some
luggage
on
the
man
merely
glanced
at
him
and
handed
him
a
ticket
number
sir
on
the
second
floor
he
announced
a
porter
conducted
him
into
a
large
bedroom
a
fire
was
blazing
in
the
grate
a
a
steamer
trunk
and
a
hatbox
were
set
out
at
the
foot
of
the
bedstead
the
heavier
luggage
labelled
for
the
hold
sir
the
man
told
him
is
and
will
go
direct
to
the
steamer
morning
that
was
according
to
your
instructions
i
believe
quite
right
philip
assented
what
time
does
the
boat
sail
three
sir
philip
frowned
this
was
his
first
disappointment
he
had
fancied
himself
on
board
early
in
the
day
the
prospect
of
a
long
morning
inaction
seemed
already
to
terrify
him
not
till
the
afternoon
he
muttered
matter
of
tide
sir
the
man
explained
you
can
go
on
board
any
time
after
eleven
in
the
morning
though
very
much
obliged
to
you
sir
the
porter
withdrew
entirely
satisfied
with
his
tip
philip
romilly
locked
the
door
after
him
carefully
then
he
drew
a
bunch
of
keys
from
his
pocket
and
after
several
attempts
opened
both
the
steamer
trunk
and
the
he
surveyed
their
carefully
packed
contents
with
a
certain
grim
and
fantastic
amusement
handled
the
silver
brushes
shook
out
a
purple
brocaded
laid
out
a
suit
of
clothes
for
the
morrow
even
selected
a
shirt
and
put
the
links
in
it
finally
he
wandered
into
the
adjoining
bathroom
took
a
hot
bath
packed
away
at
the
bottom
of
the
steamer
trunk
the
clothes
which
he
had
been
wearing
went
to
bed
and
slept
chapter
iii
the
sun
was
shining
into
his
bedroom
when
philip
romilly
was
awakened
the
next
morning
by
a
discreet
tapping
at
the
door
he
sat
up
in
bed
and
shouted
come
in
he
had
no
occasion
to
hesitate
for
a
moment
he
knew
perfectly
well
where
he
was
he
remembered
exactly
everything
that
had
happened
the
knocking
at
the
door
was
disquieting
but
he
faced
it
without
a
tremor
the
floor
waiter
appeared
and
bowed
deferentially
there
is
a
gentleman
on
the
telephone
wishes
to
speak
to
you
sir
he
announced
i
have
connected
him
with

repeated

sir
douglas
romilly
he
asked
for
he
said
that
his
name
was
gayes
i
believe
the
man
left
the
room
and
philip
took
up
the
receiver
for
a
moment
he
sat
and
thought
the
situation
was
perplexing
in
a
sense
ominous
yet
it
had
to
be
faced
he
held
the
instrument
to
his
ear
hullo
who
that
he
enquired
that
mr
romilly
was
the
reply
in
a
man
pleasant
voice
douglas

insisted

thing
was
the
cheerful
answer

off
to
america
on
a
buying
tour
our
last
advices

a
very
easy
market
over
there
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
we
could
do
better
for
you
here
and
give
you
better
terms
philip
began
to
feel
more
sure
of
himself
the
situation
after
all
he
realized
was
not
exactly
alarming
very
kind
of
you
he
said

minutes

philip
begged
i
shall
be
busy
until
then
at
twelve
precisely
then
was
the
reply
i
shall
hope
to
induce
you
to
change
your
mind
about
luncheon
it
quite
a
long
time
since
we
had
you
at
the
club
philip
set
down
the
telephone
he
was
still
in
his
pajamas
and
the
morning
was
cold
but
he
suddenly
felt
a
great
drop
of
perspiration
on
his
forehead
it
was
the
sort
of
thing
this
which
he
had
expected
had
been
prepared
for
in
fact
but
it
was
none
the
less
in
its
way
gruesome
there
was
a
further
knock
at
the
door
and
the
waiter
reappeared
can
i
bring
you
any
breakfast
sir
he
enquired
what
time
is
it
nine
sir

me
some
coffee
and
rolls
and
butter
philip
ordered
he
sprang
out
of
bed
bathed
dressed
and
ate
his
breakfast
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
repacked
his
and
descended
into
the
hall
he
made
his
way
to
the
hall
porter
enquiry
office
i
am
going
to
pay
some
calls
in
the
city
he
announced
romilly
is
my
name
and
i
may
not
be
able
to
get
back
here
before
my
boat
sails
i
am
going
on
the
can
i
have
my
luggage
sent
there
direct
by
all
means

every
article

properly
labelled
philip
continued
those
in
my
bedroom
number
are
for
the
cabin
and
those
you
have
in
your
charge
are
for
the
hold
that
will
be
quite
all
right
sir
the
man
assured
him
pocketing
his
liberal
tip
i
will
see
to
the
matter
myself
philip
paid
his
bill
at
the
office
and
breathed
a
little
more
freely
as
he
left
the
hotel
passing
a
large
window
he
stopped
suddenly
and
stared
at
his
own
reflection
there
was
something
unfamiliar
in
the
hang
of
his
clothes
and
fashionable
homburg
hat
it
was
like
the
shadow
of
some
one
else
passing
some
one
to
whom
those
clothes
belonged
then
he
remembered
remembered
with
a
cold
shiver
which
blanched
his
cheeks
and
brought
a
little
agonised
murmur
to
his
lips
the
moment
passed
however
crushed
down
stifled
as
he
had
sworn
that
he
would
stifle
all
such
memories
he
turned
in
at
a
barber
shop
had
his
hair
cut
and
yielded
to
the
solicitations
of
a
young
lady
who
was
dying
to
go
to
america
if
only
somebody
would
take
her
and
who
was
sure
that
he
ought
to
have
a
manicure
before
his
voyage
afterwards
he
entered
a
call
office
and
rang
up
the
hotel
on
the
telephone
romilly
speaking
he
announced
will
you
kindly
tell
gayes
if
he
calls
to
see
me
that
i
have
been
detained
in
the
city
and
shall
not
be
back
the
man
took
down
the
message
philip
strolled
out
once
more
into
the
streets
wandering
aimlessly
about
for
an
hour
or
more
by
this
time
it
was
nearly
one
and
selecting
a
restaurant
he
entered
and
ordered
luncheon
once
more
it
came
over
him
as
he
looked
around
the
place
that
he
had
after
all
only
a
very
imperfect
hold
upon
his
own
identity
it
seemed
impossible
that
he
philip
romilly
should
be
there
ordering
precisely
what
appealed
to
him
most
without
thought
or
care
of
the
cost
he
ate
and
drank
slowly
and
with
discrimination
and
when
he
left
the
place
he
felt
stronger
he
sought
out
a
tobacconist
bought
some
cigarettes
and
enquired
his
way
to
the
dock
at
a
few
minutes
after
two
he
passed
up
the
gangway
and
boarded
the
great
steamer
one
of
the
little
army
of
stewards
enquired
the
number
of
his
room
and
conducted
him
below
anything
i
can
do
for
you
sir
before
your
luggage
comes
on
the
man
asked
civilly
philip
shook
his
head
and
wandered
up
on
deck
again
where
there
were
already
a
fair
number
of
passengers
in
evidence
he
leaned
over
the
side
watching
the
constant
stream
of
porters
bearing
supplies
and
the
steerage
passengers
passing
into
the
forepart
of
the
ship
with
every
moment
his
impatience
grew
he
looked
at
his
watch
sometimes
half
a
dozen
times
in
ten
minutes
changed
his
position
continually
started
violently
whenever
he
heard
an
unexpected
footstep
behind
him
finally
he
broke
a
promise
he
had
made
to
himself
he
bought
newspapers
took
them
into
a
sheltered
corner
and
tore
them
open
column
by
column
he
searched
them
through
feverishly
running
his
finger
down
one
side
and
up
the
next
it
seemed
impossible
to
find
nowhere
the
heading
he
dreaded
to
see
to
realize
that
they
were
entirely
empty
of
any
exciting
incident
he
satisfied
himself
at
last
however
the
disappearance
of
a
art
teacher
had
not
yet
blazoned
out
to
a
sympathetic
world
it
was
so
much
to
the
good
there
was
a
touch
upon
his
shoulder
and
he
felt
a
chill
of
horror
when
he
turned
around
it
was
the
steward
who
had
conducted
him
below
holding
out
a
telegram
i
beg
your
pardon
sir
he
said
telegram
just
arrived
for
you
he
passed
on
almost
at
once
in
search
of
some
one
else
philip
stood
for
several
moments
perfectly
still
he
looked
at
the
inscription
set
his
teeth
and
tore
open
the
envelope
understood
you
were
returning
to
factory
before
leaving
am
posting
a
few
final
particulars
to
waldorf
hotel
new
york
staff
joins
me
in
wishing
you
bon
voyage
philip
felt
his
heart
cease
its
pounding
felt
an
immense
sense
of
relief
it
was
a
wonderful
thing
this
message
it
cleared
up
one
point
on
which
he
had
been
anxious
and
unsettled
it
was
taken
for
granted
at
the
works
then
that
he
had
come
straight
to
liverpool
he
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
on
the
side
remote
from
the
dock
driving
this
into
his
mind
everything
was
wonderfully
simplified
if
only
he
could
get
across
once
reach
new
york
meanwhile
he
looked
at
his
watch
again
and
discovered
that
it
wanted
but
ten
minutes
to
three
he
made
his
way
back
down
to
his
stateroom
which
was
already
filled
with
his
luggage
he
shook
out
an
ulster
from
a
bundle
of
wraps
and
selected
a
tweed
cap
already
there
was
a
faint
touch
of
the
sea
in
the
river
breeze
and
he
was
impatient
for
the
immeasurable
open
spaces
the
salt
wind
the
rise
and
fall
of
the
great
ship
then
as
he
stood
on
the
threshold
of
his
cabin
he
heard
voices
down
in
number
eh
yes
sir
he
heard
his
steward
voice
reply
romilly
has
just
gone
down
you
only
a
minute
sir
before
the
last
call
for
passengers
that
all
right
the
voice
which
had
spoken
to
him
over
the
telephone
that
morning
replied
i
just
like
to
shake
hands
with
him
and
wish
him
bon
voyage
philip
teeth
came
together
in
a
little
fury
of
anger
it
was
maddening
this
to
be
trapped
when
only
a
few
minutes
remained
between
him
and
safety
his
brain
worked
swiftly
he
took
his
chance
of
finding
the
next
stateroom
empty
as
it
happened
to
be
and
stepped
quickly
inside
he
kept
his
back
to
the
door
until
the
footsteps
had
passed
he
heard
the
knock
at
his
stateroom
stepped
back
into
the
corridor
and
passed
along
a
little
gangway
to
the
other
side
of
the
ship
he
hurried
up
the
stairs
and
into
the
the
bugle
was
sounding
now
and
hoarse
voices
were
shouting
every
one
for
the
shore
last
call
for
the
shore
give
me
a
brandy
and
soda
he
begged
the
steward
who
was
just
opening
the
bar
the
man
glanced
at
the
clock
and
obeyed
philip
swallowed
half
of
it
at
a
gulp
then
sat
down
with
the
tumbler
in
his
hand
all
of
a
sudden
something
disappeared
from
in
front
of
one
of
the
portholes
his
heart
gave
a
little
jump
they
were
moving
he
sprang
up
and
hurried
to
the
doorway
slowly
but
unmistakably
they
were
gliding
away
from
the
dock
already
a
lengthening
line
of
people
were
waving
their
handkerchiefs
and
shouting
farewells
around
them
in
the
river
little
tugs
were
screaming
and
the
ropes
from
the
dock
had
been
thrown
loose
philip
stepped
to
the
rail
his
heart
growing
lighter
at
every
moment
his
ubiquitous
steward
laden
with
hand
luggage
paused
for
a
moment
i
sent
a
gentleman
down
to
your
stateroom
just
before
the
steamer
started
sir
he
announced
gentleman
of
the
name
of
gayes
who
wanted
to
say
to
you
bad
luck
philip
answered
i
must
have
just
missed
him
the
steward
turned
around
and
pointed
to
the
quay
there
he
is
sir
elderly
gentleman
in
a
grey
suit
and
a
bunch
of
violets
in
his
buttonhole
he
looking
straight
at
you
philip
raised
his
cap
and
waved
it
with
enthusiasm
after
a
hesitation
the
other
man
did
the
same
the
steward
collected
his
belongings
and
shuffled
off
he
picked
you
out
sir
all
right
he
remarked
as
he
disappeared
in
the
companionway
philip
turned
away
with
a
little
final
wave
of
the
hand
glad
i
did
miss
him
altogether
he
observed
cheerfully
gayes

chapter
iv
raymond
greene
very
soon
after
the
bugle
had
sounded
for
dinner
that
evening
took
his
place
at
the
head
of
one
of
the
small
tables
in
the
saloon
and
wished
every
one
good
evening
it
was
perfectly
apparent
that
he
meant
to
enjoy
the
trip
that
he
was
prepared
to
like
his
fellow
passengers
and
that
he
wished
them
to
know
it
even
the
somewhat
steward
who
had
been
waiting
for
his
arrival
cheered
up
at
the
sight
of
his
beaming
face
and
the
other
four
occupants
of
the
table
returned
his
salutation
according
to
their
lights
two
vacant
places
i
am
sorry
to
see
greene
observed
one
of
them
i
can

other
absentee

he
stretched
across
and
glanced
at
the
name
upon
the
card
douglas

he
read
out
quite
a
good
name
english
without
a
doubt
i
have
crossed

sir
he
went
on
affably
turning
to
his
nearest
neighbour
on
the
left
a
burly
american
signified
his
assent

should
say

admitted
and
i
like

with
satisfaction

your
service
joseph
hyam
mine
the
large
american
announced
watching
the
disappearance
of
his
soup
plate
with
an
air
of
regret
i
in
the
clothing
business
if
my
wife
were
here
she
say
you
would
think
it
to
look
at
me
never
was
faddy
about
myself
though
he
added
with
a
glance
at
greene
very
correct
dinner
attire
you
ought
to
remember
me
greene
one
of
the
two
men
remarked
from
the
side
of
the
table
i
played
golf
with
you
at
baltusrol
more
than
once
greene
glanced
surreptitiously
at
the
card
and
smiled
why
it
james
busby
of
course
he
exclaimed
your
father
the
busby
iron
works
is
he
the
young
man
nodded
and
this
is
caroll
one
of
our
engineers
he
said
indicating
a
rather
personage
by
his
side
delighted
to
meet
you
both
greene
assured
them

i
remember
your
golf
busby
you
some
driver
eh
and
those
long
putts
of
yours
you
never
took
three
on
any
green
that
i
can
remember
been
playing
in
england
the
young
man
asked
raymond
greene
shook
his
head
when
i
am
on
business
he
explained
i
do
carry
my
sticks
about
with
me
and
i
tell
you
this
last
fortnight
has
been
a
giddy
whirl
for
me
i
was
in
berlin
wednesday
night
and
i
did
business
in
vienna
last
monday
ah
here
comes
miss
dalstan
he
rose
ceremoniously
to
his
feet
a
young
lady
who
was
still
wearing
her
travelling
clothes
smiled
at
him
delightfully
and
sank
into
the
chair
by
his
side
during
the
little
stir
caused
by
her
arrival
no
one
paid
any
attention
to
the
man
who
had
slipped
into
the
other
vacant
place
opposite
greene
however
when
he
had
finished
making
known
his
companion
wants
to
the
steward
welcomed
philip
romilly
genially
now
we
a
full
table
he
declared
that
what
i
like
i
only
hope
we
keep
it
up
all
the
voyage
mind
there
be
a
forfeit
for
the
first
one
that
misses
a
meal
romilly
is
it
he
went
on
glancing
at
his
neighbour
card
once
more
my
name
raymond
greene
i
am
an
old
traveller
and
there
nothing
i
enjoy
more
outside
my
business
than
these
little
ocean
trips
especially
when
they
come
after
a
pretty
strenuous
time
on
shore
crossed
many
times
sir
never
before
philip
answered
first
trip
eh
greene
remarked
mildly
interested
well
well
you
some
surprises
in
store
for
you
then
let
me
make
you
acquainted
with
your
opposite
neighbour
miss
elizabeth
dalstan
i
dare
say
even
if
you
have
been
in
the
states
you
know
some
of
our
principal
actresses
by
name
philip
raised
his
head
and
caught
a
glimpse
of
a
rather
pale
face
a
mass
of
deep
brown
hair
a
pleasant
smile
from
a
very
shapely
mouth
and
the
rather
intense
regard
of
a
pair
of
wonderfully
soft
eyes
whose
colour
at
that
moment
he
was
not
able
to
determine
i
have
had
the
pleasure
of
seeing
miss
dalstan
on
the
stage
he
observed
capital
raymond
greene
exclaimed
we
have
met
before
have
we
romilly
something
kind
of
familiar
in
your
face
you
are
not
by
way
of
being
in
the
profession
are
you
romilly
shook
his
head
i
am
a
manufacturer
he
acknowledged
that
so
his
neighbour
remarked
a
trifle
surprised
queer
i
had
a
fancy
that
we
met
and
quite
lately
too
i
am
in
the
cinema
business
you
may
have
heard
of
me
raymond
greene
i
have
seen
some
of
your
films
philip
told
him
very
excellent
productions
if
you
will
allow
me
to
say
so
that
pleasant
hearing
at
any
time
greene
admitted
with
a
gratified
smile
well
i
can
see
that
we
are
going
to
be
quite
a
friendly
party
that
busby
on
your
right
romilly
some
golfer
i
can
tell
you
and
his
friend
caroll
alongside
the
lady
next
you
my
name
is
miss
pinsent
the
elderly
lady
indicated
declared
pleasantly
replying
to
greene
interrogative
glance
it
is
my
first
trip
to
america
too
i
am
going
out
to
see
a
nephew
who
has
settled
in
chicago
capital
raymond
greene
repeated
now
we
are
all
more
or
less
a
family
party
what
did
you
say
your
line
of
business
was
mr
romilly
i
do
remember
mentioning
it
philip
observed
but
i
am
a
manufacturer
of
boots
and
shoes
elizabeth
dalstan
looked
across
at
him
a
little
curiously
one
might
have
surmised
that
she
was
in
some
way
disappointed
coming
over
to
learn
a
thing
or
two
from
us
eh
greene
went
on
you
use
all
our
machinery
do
you
well
there
paul
lawton
on
board
from
brockton
i
should
think
he
has
one
of
the
biggest
plants
in
massachusetts
i
must
make
you
acquainted
with
him
philip
frowned
slightly
that
is
very
kind
of
you
greene
he
acknowledged
but
do
you
know
i
would
very
much
rather
not
talk
business
with
any
one
while
i
am
on
the
steamer
i
am
a
little
overworked
and
i
need
the
rest
elizabeth
dalstan
looked
at
her
with
some
renewal
of
her
former
interest
she
saw
a
young
man
who
was
without
doubt
although
he
certainly
had
an
and
somewhat
depressed
appearance
his
cheeks
were
colourless
and
there
were
little
dark
lines
under
his
eyes
as
though
he
suffered
from
sleeplessness
he
was
and
he
had
the
sensitive
mouth
of
an
artist
his
forehead
was
high
and
exceptionally
good
his
air
of
breeding
was
unmistakable
you
do
look
a
little
fagged
raymond
greene
observed
sympathetically
well
these
are
strenuous
days
in
business
we
all
have
to
stretch
out
as
far
as
we
can
go
and
keep
stretched
out
or
else
some
one
else
will
get
ahead
of
us
business
been
good
with
you
this
fall
mr
romilly
very
fair
thank
you
philip
answered
a
little
vaguely
tell
me
miss
dalstan
he
went
on
leaning
slightly
towards
her
and
with
a
note
of
curiosity
in
his
tone
i
want
to
know
your
candid
opinion
of
the
last
act
of
the
play
i
saw
you
in
second
wife
i
made
up
my
mind
that
if
ever
i
had
the
privilege
of
meeting
you
i
would
ask
you
that
question
i
know
exactly
why
she
declared
with
a
quick
little
nod
of
appreciation
listen
they
talked
together
for
some
time
earnestly
greene
addressed
his
conversation
to
his
neighbours
lower
down
the
table
it
was
not
until
the
arrival
of
dessert
that
philip
and
his
abandoned
their
discussion
tell
me
have
you
written
yourself
mr
romilly
elizabeth
dalstan
asked
him
with
interest
i
have
made
an
attempt
at
it
he
confessed
most
difficult
thing
in
the
whole
world
to
write
a
play
raymond
greene
intervened
seeing
an
opportunity
to
join
once
more
in
the
conversation
most
difficult
thing
in
the
world
i
should
say
now
with
pictures
it
entirely
different
the
slightest
little
happening
in
everyday
life
may
give
you
the
start
and
then
there
you
are
the
whole
thing
unravels
itself
now
let
me
give
you
an
example
he
went
on
helping
himself
to
a
little
more
whisky
and
soda
only
yesterday
afternoon
on
our
way
up
to
liverpool
the
train
got
pulled
up
somewhere
in
derbyshire
and
i
sat
looking
out
of
the
window
it
was
a
dreary
neighbourhood
a
miserable
afternoon
and
we
happened
to
be
crossing
a
rather
high
viaduct
down
below
were
some
meadows
and
a
canal
and
by
the
side
of
the
canal
a
path
at
a
certain
point
i
should
think
about
half
a
mile
from
where
the
train
was
standing
this
path
went
underneath
a
rude
bridge
built
of
bricks
and
covered
over
with
turf
well
as
i
sat
there
i
could
see
two
men
both
approaching
the
bridge
along
the
path
from
opposite
directions
one
was
tall
dressed
in
light
tweeds
a
fellow
looked
like
one
of
your
country
squires
except
that
he
was
a
little
on
the
thin
side
the
other
was
a
person
dressed
in
dark
clothes
about
your
height
and
build
i
should
say
romilly
well
they
both
disappeared
under
that
bridge
at
the
same
moment
and
i
do
know
why
but
i
leaned
forward
to
see
them
come
out
the
train
was
there
for
quite
another
two
minutes
perhaps
more
there
was
another
soul
anywhere
in
sight
and
it
was
raining
as
it
only
can
rain
in
england
raymond
greene
paused
every
one
at
the
table
had
been
listening
intently
he
glanced
around
at
their
rapt
faces
with
satisfaction
he
was
conscious
of
the
artist
dramatic
touch
once
more
it
had
not
failed
him
he
had
excited
interest
in
philip
romilly
eyes
there
was
something
even
more
than
interest
it
seemed
almost
as
though
he
were
trying
to
project
his
thoughts
back
and
conjure
up
for
himself
the
very
scene
which
was
being
described
to
him
the
young
man
was
certainly
in
a
very
delicate
state
of
health
greene
decided
you
are
keeping
us
in
suspense
sir
the
elderly
lady
complained
leaning
forward
in
her
place
please
go
on
what
happened
when
they
came
out
that
raymond
greene
said
impressively
is
the
point
of
the
story
the
train
remained
standing
there
as
i
have
said
for
several
minutes
as
many
minutes
in
fact
as
it
would
have
taken
them
seconds
to
have
traversed
that
tunnel
notwithstanding
that
they
neither
of
them
appeared
again
i
sat
there
believe
me
with
my
eyes
fastened
upon
that
path
and
when
the
train
started
i
leaned
out
of
the
window
until
we
had
rounded
the
curve
and
we
were
out
of
sight
but
i
never
saw
either
of
those
two
men
again
now
there
the
beginning
of
a
film
story
for
you
what
do
you
want
more
than
that
there
dramatic
interest
surprise
an
original
situation
after
all
i
suppose
the
explanation
was
quite
a
simple
one
busby
remarked
they
were
probably
acquaintances
and
they
stayed
to
have
a
chat
raymond
greene
shook
his
head
doubtfully
all
i
can
say
to
that
is
that
it
was
a
queer
place
to
choose
for
a
little
friendly
conversation
he
pronounced
they
were
both
tall
men
about
the
same
height
i
should
say
and
it
would
have
been
impossible
for
them
to
have
even
stood
upright
you
mentioned
the
fact
did
you
not
the
lady
who
called
herself
miss
pinsent
observed
that
it
was
raining
heavily
at
the
time
perhaps
they
stayed
under
the
bridge
to
shelter
that
something
i
never
thought
of
greene
admitted
perhaps
for
the
reason
that
they
both
of
them
seemed
quite
indifferent
to
the
rain
the
young
man
in
the
dark
clothes
had
even
an
umbrella
i
must
admit
that
i
allowed
my
thoughts
to
travel
in
another
direction
professional
instinct
you
see
it
was
a
fairly
broad
canal
and
the
water
was
nearly
up
to
the
i
lay
a
wager
it
was
twelve
or
fifteen
feet
deep
supposing
those
two
men
had
met
on
that
narrow
path
and
quarrelled
supposing

raymond
greene
stopped
short
he
gazed
in
amazement
at
elizabeth
dalstan
who
had
suddenly
clutched
his
hand
there
was
something
in
her
face
which
puzzled
as
well
as
startled
him
she
had
been
looking
at
her
opposite
neighbour
but
she
turned
back
towards
the
narrator
of
this
thrilling
story
as
the
monosyllable
broke
from
her
lips
please
stop
she
begged
you
are
too
dramatic
greene
you
really
frighten
me
frighten
you
he
repeated
my
dear
miss
dalstan
i
suppose
it
is
very
absurd
of
me
she
went
on
smiling
appealingly
at
him
but
your
words
were
altogether
too
graphic
i
ca
bear
to
think
of
what
might
have
taken
place
underneath
that
tunnel
you
must
remember
that
i
saw
it
too
do
go
on
do
talk
about
it
any
more
i
am
going
upstairs
for
my
cigarette
are
you
coming
to
get
my
chair
for
me
greene
or
must
i
rely
upon
the
deck
steward
raymond
greene
was
a
very
gallant
man
and
he
did
not
hesitate
for
a
moment
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
escorted
the
young
lady
from
the
saloon
he
glanced
back
as
he
left
the
table
to
nod
his
adieux
to
the
little
company
whom
he
had
taken
under
his
charge
philip
romilly
was
gazing
steadfastly
out
of
the
porthole
kind
of
delicate
young
fellow
that
he
remarked
nice
face
too
ca
help
thinking
that
i
met
or
seen
some
one
like
him
lately
chapter
v
philip
romilly
found
himself
alone
at
last
with
the
things
which
he
had
craved
darkness
solitude
the
rushing
of
the
salt
wind
the
sense
of
open
spaces
on
the
other
the
sheltered
side
of
the
steamer
long
lines
of
passengers
were
stretched
in
wicker
chairs
smoking
and
drinking
their
coffee
but
where
he
was
no
one
came
save
an
occasional
promenader
yet
even
here
was
a
disappointment
he
had
come
for
peace
for
a
brief
escape
from
the
thrall
of
memories
which
during
the
last
few
hours
had
become
charged
with
horrors
and
there
was
to
be
no
peace
in
the
shadowy
darkness
which
rested
upon
the
sea
flying
past
him
he
saw
again
with
horrible
distinctness
the
face
the
figure
of
the
man
who
for
those
few
brief
minutes
he
had
hated
with
a
desperate
and
passionate
hatred
he
saw
the
broken
photograph
the
glass
splintered
into
a
thousand
pieces
he
saw
the
man
himself
choking
sinking
down
beneath
the
black
waters
heard
the
stifled
cry
from
his
palsied
lips
saw
the
slow
dawning
agony
of
death
in
his
distorted
features
some
one
was
playing
a
mandolin
down
in
the
second
class
he
heard
the
feet
of
a
dancer
upon
the
deck
the
little
murmur
of
applause
well
after
all
this
was
life
it
was
a
rebuke
of
fate
to
his
own
illogical
and
useless
vapourings
men
died
every
second
whilst
women
danced
and
no
one
who
knew
life
had
any
care
save
for
the
measure
of
their
own
days
some
freakish
thought
pleaded
stridently
his
own
justification
his
mind
travelled
back
down
the
gloomy
avenues
of
his
past
along
those
last
aching
years
of
grinding
and
undeserved
poverty
he
remembered
his
upbringing
his
widowed
mother
a
woman
used
to
every
luxury
struggling
to
make
both
ends
meet
in
a
suburban
street
in
a
hired
cottage
filled
with
hired
furniture
he
remembered
his
schooldays
devoid
of
pocket
money
unable
to
join
in
the
sports
of
others
slaving
with
melancholy
perseverance
for
a
scholarship
to
lighten
his
mother
burden
always
there
was
the
same
ghastly
crushing
penuriousness
the
struggle
to
make
a
living
before
his
schooldays
were
well
over
the
unbought
books
he
had
fingered
at
the
bookstalls
and
let
drop
again
the
coarse
clothes
he
had
been
compelled
to
wear
the
scanty
food
he
had
eaten
the
narrow
driving
ways
of
poverty
culminating
in
his
mother
death
and
his
own
fear
he
at
the
age
of
nineteen
years
lest
the
money
for
her
funeral
should
not
be
forthcoming
if
there
were
any
hell
surely
he
had
lived
in
it
this
other
whose
flames
mocked
him
now
could
be
no
worse
sin
crime
he
remembered
the
words
of
the
girl
who
during
these
latter
years
had
represented
to
him
what
there
might
have
been
of
light
in
life
he
remembered
and
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
could
meet
that
ghostly
image
which
had
risen
from
the
black
waters
without
shrinking
almost
contemptuously
fate
had
mocked
him
long
enough
it
was
time
indeed
that
he
helped
himself
he
swung
away
from
the
solitude
to
the
other
side
of
the
steamer
paused
in
a
sheltered
spot
while
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
paced
up
and
down
the
more
frequented
ways
a
soft
voice
from
an
invisible
mass
of
furs
and
rugs
called
to
him
romilly
please
come
and
talk
to
me
my
rug
has
slipped
thank
you
so
much
take
this
chair
next
mine
for
a
few
minutes
wo
you
greene
has
rushed
off
to
the
smoking
room
i
think
he
has
just
been
told
that
there
is
a
rival
cinema
producer
on
board
and
he
is
trying
to
run
him
to
ground
philip
settled
himself
without
hesitation
in
the
vacant
place
one
is
forced
to
envy
raymond
greene
he
sighed
to
have
work
in
life
which
one
loves
as
he
does
his
is
the
rarest
form
of
happiness
what
about
your
own
she
asked
him
but
you
are
a
manufacturer
are
you
not
somehow
or
other
that
surprises
me
and
me
he
acknowledged
frankly
i
mean
that
i
wonder
i
have
persevered
at
it
so
long
but
you
are
a
very
young
man
young
or
old
he
answered
i
am
one
of
those
who
have
made
a
false
start
in
life
i
am
on
my
way
to
new
things
do
you
think
miss
dalstan
that
your
country
is
a
good
place
for
one
to
visit
who
seeks
new
things
she
turned
in
her
chair
a
little
more
towards
him
against
the
background
of
empty
spaces
the
pale
softness
of
her
face
seemed
to
gain
a
new
attractiveness
well
that
depends
she
said
reflectively
upon
what
these
new
things
might
be
which
you
desire
for
an
ambitious
business
man
america
is
a
great
country
but
supposing
one
had
finished
with
business
he
persisted
supposing
one
wanted
to
develop
tastes
and
a
gift
for
another
method
of
life
then
i
should
say
that
new
york
is
the
one
place
in
the
world
she
told
him
you
are
speaking
of
yourself
yes
you
have
ambitions
i
am
sure
she
continued
tell
me
are
they
literary
i
would
like
to
call
them
so
he
admitted
i
have
written
a
play
and
three
stories
so
bad
that
no
one
would
produce
the
play
or
publish
the
stories
you
have
brought
them
with
you
he
shook
his
head
no
they
are
where
i
shall
never
see
them
again
never
see
them
again
she
repeated
puzzled
i
mean
that
i
have
left
them
at
home
i
have
left
them
there
perhaps
to
a
certain
extent
deliberately
he
went
on
you
see
the
idea
is
still
with
me
i
think
that
i
shall
rewrite
them
when
i
have
settled
down
in
america
i
fancy
that
i
shall
find
myself
in
an
atmosphere
more
conducive
to
the
sort
of
work
i
want
to
do
i
would
rather
not
be
handicapped
by
the
ghosts
of
my
old
failures
one
ghosts
are
hard
sometimes
to
escape
from
she
whispered
he
clutched
nervously
at
the
end
of
his
rug
she
looked
up
and
down
along
the
row
of
chairs
there
were
one
or
two
slumbering
forms
but
most
were
empty
there
were
no
promenaders
in
sight
you
know
she
asked
her
voice
still
very
low
why
i
left
the
saloon
a
little
abruptly
this
evening
why
he
demanded
because
she
went
on
i
could
see
the
effect
which
raymond
greene
story
had
upon
you
because
i
also
was
in
that
train
and
i
have
better
eyesight
than
greene
you
were
one
of
the
two
men
who
were
walking
along
the
towpath
well
he
muttered
you
have
nothing
to
tell
me
nothing
she
waited
for
a
moment
at
least
you
have
not
attempted
to
persuade
me
that
you
lingered
underneath
that
bridge
to
escape
from
the
rain
she
remarked
if
i
can
not
tell
you
the
truth
he
promised
i
am
not
going
to
tell
you
a
lie
but
apart
from
that
i
admit
nothing
i
do
not
even
admit
that
it
was
i
whom
you
saw
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
the
touch
of
her
fingers
was
wonderful
cool
and
soft
and
somehow
reassuring
he
felt
a
sense
of
relaxation
felt
the
strain
of
living
suddenly
grow
less
you
know
she
said
all
my
friends
tell
me
that
i
am
a
restful
person
you
are
living
at
high
pressure
are
you
not
try
and
forget
it
fate
makes
queer
uses
of
all
of
us
sometimes
she
sends
her
noblest
sons
down
into
the
shadows
and
pitchforks
her
outcasts
into
the
high
places
of
life
those
do
best
who
learn
to
control
themselves
to
live
and
think
for
the
best
go
on
talking
to
me
he
begged
is
it
your
voice
i
wonder
that
is
so
soothing
or
just
what
you
say
she
smiled
reassuringly
you
are
glad
because
you
have
found
a
friend
she
told
him
and
a
friend
who
even
if
she
does
not
understand
does
not
wish
to
understand
do
you
see
i
wish
i
felt
that
i
deserved
it
he
groaned
she
laughed
almost
gaily
what
a
sorting
up
there
would
be
of
our
places
in
life
she
declared
if
we
all
had
just
what
we
deserved
now
give
me
your
arm
i
want
to
walk
a
little
while
we
walk
if
you
like
i
will
try
to
tell
you
what
i
can
about
new
york
it
may
interest
you
they
walked
up
and
down
the
deck
and
by
degrees
their
conversation
drifted
into
a
discussion
of
such
recent
plays
as
were
familiar
to
both
of
them
at
the
far
end
of
the
ship
she
clung
to
him
once
or
twice
as
the
wind
came
booming
over
the
freshening
waves
she
weighed
and
measured
his
criticisms
of
the
plays
they
spoke
of
and
in
the
main
approved
of
them
when
at
last
she
stopped
outside
the
companionway
and
bade
him
good
night
the
deck
was
almost
deserted
they
were
near
one
of
the
electric
lights
and
he
saw
her
face
more
distinctly
than
he
had
seen
it
at
all
realised
more
adequately
its
wonderful
charm
the
large
firm
mouth
womanly
and
tender
though
it
was
was
almost
the
mouth
of
a
protector
she
smiled
at
him
as
one
might
smile
at
a
boy
you
are
to
sleep
well
she
said
firmly
those
are
my
orders
good
night
she
gave
him
her
hand
a
woman
soft
and
delicate
fingers
yet
clasping
his
with
an
almost
virile
strength
and
friendliness
she
left
him
with
just
that
feeling
about
her
that
she
was
expansive
in
her
heart
her
sympathies
even
her
brain
and
peculiar
gifts
of
apprehension
she
left
him
too
with
a
curious
sense
of
restfulness
as
though
suddenly
he
had
become
metamorphosed
into
the
woman
and
had
found
a
guardian
he
abandoned
without
a
second
thought
his
intention
of
going
to
the
and
sitting
up
late
the
thought
of
his
empty
stateroom
a
horror
to
him
a
few
hours
ago
seemed
suddenly
almost
alluring
and
he
made
his
way
there
cheerfully
he
felt
the
sleep
already
upon
his
eyes
chapter
vi
all
the
physical
exhilaration
of
his
unlived
youth
seemed
to
be
dancing
in
philip
romilly
veins
when
he
awoke
the
next
morning
to
find
an
open
porthole
the
blue
sea
tossing
away
to
infinity
and
his
cheerful
face
at
his
bedside
bathroom
steward
says
if
you
are
ready
sir
he
can
arrange
for
your
bath
now
the
man
announced
philip
sprang
out
of
bed
and
reached
for
his
bond
street
i
bring
you
a
cup
of
tea
when
you
get
back
sir
the
steward
continued
the
bathrooms
are
exactly
opposite
the
sting
of
the
salt
water
seemed
to
complete
his
philip
dressed
and
shaved
whistling
softly
all
the
time
to
himself
he
even
found
a
queer
sort
of
interest
in
examining
his
stock
of
ties
and
other
garments
the
memory
of
elizabeth
dalstan
words
was
still
in
his
brain
they
had
become
the
text
of
his
life
this
he
told
himself
was
his
birthday
he
even
accepted
without
a
tremor
a
letter
and
telegram
which
the
steward
brought
him
these
were
in
the
rack
for
you
sir
he
said
i
meant
to
bring
them
down
last
night
but
we
had
a
busy
start
off
philip
took
them
up
on
deck
to
read
he
tore
open
the
telegram
first
and
permitted
himself
a
little
start
when
he
saw
the
signature
it
was
sent
off
from
detton
magna
why
did
you
not
come
as
promised
what
am
i
to
do
beatrice
the
envelope
of
the
letter
he
opened
with
a
little
more
compunction
it
was
written
on
the
printed
notepaper
of
the
douglas
romilly
shoe
company
and
was
of
no
great
length
dear
romilly
i
understood
that
you
would
return
to
the
factory
this
evening
for
a
few
minutes
before
taking
the
train
to
liverpool
there
were
one
or
two
matters
upon
which
i
should
like
some
further
information
but
as
time
is
short
i
am
writing
to
you
at
the
waldorf
hotel
at
new
york
i
see
that
the
acceptances
due
next
are
unusually
heavy
but
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
had
spoken
to
henshaw
at
the
bank
concerning
these
and
in
any
case
i
presume
there
would
be
no
difficulty
wishing
you
every
success
on
the
other
side
and
a
safe
return
i
am
your
obedient
servant
potts
there
is
not
the
slightest
doubt
philip
said
to
himself
as
he
tore
both
communications
into
pieces
and
watched
them
flutter
away
downwards
that
i
am
on
my
way
to
new
york
if
only
one
knew
what
had
become
of
that
poor
art
master
he
went
down
to
breakfast
and
afterwards
strolled
aimlessly
about
the
deck
his
sense
of
enjoyment
was
so
extraordinarily
keen
that
he
found
it
hard
to
settle
down
to
any
of
the
usual
light
occupations
of
idle
travellers
he
was
content
to
stand
by
the
rail
and
gaze
across
the
sea
a
new
wonder
to
him
or
to
lie
about
in
his
steamer
chair
and
listen
with
eyes
to
the
hissing
of
the
spray
and
the
faint
music
of
the
wind
his
mind
turned
by
chance
to
one
of
those
stories
of
which
he
had
spoken
a
sudden
new
vigour
of
thought
seemed
to
rend
it
inside
out
almost
in
those
first
few
seconds
he
thought
of
the
garret
in
which
it
had
been
written
the
wretched
surroundings
the
odoriferous
food
the
thick
crockery
the
vista
of
roofs
and
chimneys
the
genius
of
a
stevenson
would
have
become
dwarfed
in
such
surroundings
a
phrase
a
happy
idea
suddenly
caught
his
fancy
he
itched
for
a
pencil
and
paper
then
he
looked
up
to
find
the
one
thing
wanting
elizabeth
dalstan
followed
by
a
maid
carrying
rugs
and
cushions
had
paused
smiling
by
his
side
you
have
slept
and
you
are
better
she
said
pleasantly
now
for
the
next
few
minutes
you
must
please
devote
yourself
to
making
me
comfortable
put
everything
down
phoebe
romilly
will
look
after
me
for
a
moment
he
paused
before
proceeding
to
his
task
i
want
to
look
at
you
he
confessed
remember
i
have
only
seen
you
under
the
electric
lights
of
the
saloon
or
in
that
queer
violet
gloom
of
last
night
why
you
have
quite
light
hair
and
i
thought
it
was
dark
she
laughed
and
turned
slowly
around
here
i
am
she
announced
a
much
bephotographed
person
almost
plain
some
journalists
have
dared
to
call
me
but
for
my
expression
on
flowing
lines
as
you
see
because
i
always
wear
such
loose
clothes
and
yet
believe
me
slim
as
a
matter
of
fact
she
went
on
pensively
i
am
rather
proud
of
my
figure
a
little
journalist
who
had
annoyed
me
and
to
whom
i
was
rude
once
called
it
ample
no
one
has
ever
ventured
to
say
more
the
critics
who
love
me
and
they
most
of
them
love
me
because
i
am
so
exceptionally
polite
to
them
and
tell
them
exactly
what
to
say
about
every
new
play
allude
to
my
physique
as
grecian
but
your
eyes
he
exclaimed
last
night
i
thought
they
were
grey
this
morning
why
surely
they
are
brown
you
see
that
is
all
according
to
the
light
she
confided
if
any
one
does
try
to
write
a
description
of
me
they
generally
evade
the
point
by
calling
them
a
young
man
who
was
in
love
with
me
she
sighed
but
that
was
long
ago
used
to
say
that
they
reminded
him
of
fallen
leaves
in
a
place
where
the
sunlight
sometimes
is
and
sometimes
is
and
now
if
you
please
i
want
to
be
made
exceedingly
comfortable
i
want
you
to
find
the
deck
steward
and
see
that
i
have
some
beef
tea
as
quickly
as
possible
i
want
my
box
of
cigarettes
on
one
side
and
my
vanity
case
on
the
other
and
i
should
like
to
listen
to
the
plot
of
your
play
he
obeyed
her
behests
with
scrupulous
care
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
brought
into
the
foreground
of
his
mind
the
figures
of
those
men
and
women
who
had
told
his
story
finding
them
to
his
dismay
unexpectedly
crude
and
unlifelike
and
the
story
itself
was
unhappiness
so
necessary
after
all
they
suddenly
seemed
to
crumble
away
into
insignificance
these
men
and
women
of
his
creation
in
their
place
he
could
almost
fancy
a
race
of
larger
beings
a
more
extensive
canvas
a
more
splendid
a
riper
and
richer
vocabulary
nothing
that
i
have
ever
done
he
sighed
is
worth
talking
to
you
about
but
if
you
are
going
to
be
my
friend
well
if
you
are
going
to
be
my
friend
he
went
on
with
almost
inspired
conviction
i
shall
write
something
different
one
can
rebuild
she
murmured
one
can
sometimes
use
the
old
pieces
life
and
chess
are
both
like
that
would
you
help
me
i
wonder
he
asked
impulsively
she
looked
away
from
him
out
across
the
steamer
rail
she
seemed
to
be
measuring
with
her
eyes
the
roll
of
the
ship
as
it
rose
and
fell
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
you
are
a
strange
person
she
said
tell
me
are
you
in
the
habit
of
becoming
suddenly
dependent
upon
people
not
i
he
assured
her
if
i
were
to
tell
you
how
my
last
ten
years
have
been
spent
you
would
not
believe
me
you
could
if
i
were
to
speak
of
a
tearing
unutterable
loneliness
if
i
were
to
speak
of
poverty
not
the
poverty
you
know
anything
about
but
the
poverty
of
bare
walls
of
coarse
food
and
little
enough
of
it
of
everything
cheap
and
miserable
and
soiled
and
nothing
fresh
nothing
real
he
stopped
abruptly
but
i
forgot
he
muttered
i
ca
explain
is
one
to
understand
she
asked
a
little
puzzled
that
you
have
had
difficulties
in
your
business
i
have
never
been
in
business
he
answered
quickly
my
name
is
romilly
but
i
am
not
romilly
the
manufacturer
for
the
last
eight
years
i
have
lived
in
a
garret
in
london
teaching
false
art
in
a
school
some
of
the
time
doing
journalistic
work
when
i
got
the
chance
clerk
for
a
month
or
two
in
a
brewer
office
and
sacked
for
incapacity
those
are
a
few
of
the
real
threads
in
my
life
at
the
present
moment
then
she
observed
you
are
an
impostor
exactly
he
admitted
and
i
should
probably
have
been
repenting
it
by
now
but
for
your
words
last
night
she
smiled
at
him
and
the
sun
shone
once
more
it
was
an
ordinary
smile
at
all
it
was
just
as
though
she
were
letting
him
into
the
light
of
her
understanding
as
though
some
one
from
the
world
entrance
into
which
he
had
craved
had
stooped
down
to
understand
and
was
telling
him
that
all
was
well
he
drew
his
chair
a
little
closer
to
hers
we
are
all
more
or
less
impostors
she
said
does
any
one
i
wonder
go
about
the
world
telling
everybody
what
they
really
are
how
they
really
live
dear
me
how
unpleasant
and
uncomfortable
it
would
be
you
are
so
wise
my
new
friend
you
know
the
value
of
impulses
you
tell
me
the
truth
and
i
am
your
friend
i
do
not
need
facts
because
facts
count
for
little
i
judge
by
what
lies
behind
and
i
understand
do
not
weary
me
with
explanations
i
like
what
you
have
told
me
only
of
course
your
work
must
have
suffered
from
surroundings
like
that
will
it
be
better
for
you
now
i
shall
land
in
new
york
he
told
her
with
at
least
a
thousand
pounds
that
is
about
as
much
as
i
have
spent
in
ten
years
there
is
the
possibility
of
other
money
concerning
that
well
i
ca
make
up
my
mind
the
thousand
pounds
of
course
is
stolen
so
i
gathered
she
remarked
do
you
continue
may
i
ask
to
be
douglas
romilly
the
manufacturer
he
shook
his
head
a
little
vaguely
i
have
thought
he
confessed
but
of
course
i
do
i
have
risked
everything
for
the
chance
of
a
new
life
i
shall
start
it
in
a
new
way
and
under
a
new
name
he
was
suddenly
conscious
of
her
pity
of
a
moistness
in
her
eyes
as
she
looked
at
him
i
think
she
said
that
you
must
have
been
very
miserable
above
all
things
now
whatever
you
may
have
done
for
your
liberty
do
be
fainthearted
if
you
are
in
trouble
or
danger
you
must
come
to
me
you
promise
if
i
may
he
assented
fervently
now
i
must
hear
the
play
as
it
stood
in
your
thoughts
when
you
wrote
it
she
insisted
i
have
a
fancy
that
it
will
sound
a
little
gloomy
am
i
right
he
laughed
of
course
you
are
how
could
i
write
in
any
other
way
except
through
the
darkened
spectacles
however
there
a
way
out
of
altering
it
i
mean
i
feel
flashes
of
it
already
listen
the
story
expanded
with
relation
he
no
longer
felt
confined
to
its
established
lines
every
now
and
then
he
paused
to
tell
her
that
this
or
that
was
new
and
she
nodded
appreciatively
they
walked
for
a
time
watched
the
seagulls
and
bade
their
farewell
to
the
irish
coast
you
will
have
to
that
play
for
me
she
said
a
little
abruptly
as
she
paused
before
the
companionway
i
am
going
down
to
my
room
for
a
few
minutes
before
lunch
now
afterwards
i
shall
bring
up
a
pencil
and
paper
we
will
make
some
notes
together
philip
walked
on
to
the
smoking
room
he
could
scarcely
believe
that
the
planks
he
trod
were
of
solid
wood
raymond
greene
met
him
at
the
entrance
and
slapped
him
on
the
back
just
in
time
for
a
cocktail
before
lunch
he
exclaimed
i
was
looking
everywhere
for
a
pal
two
martinis
dry
as
you
like
jim
he
added
turning
round
to
the
smoking
room
steward
sure
you
wo
join
us
lawton
dare
was
the
laconic
answer
from
the
man
whom
he
had
addressed
raymond
greene
went
on
let
me
make
you
two
acquainted
this
is
douglas
romilly
an
english
boot
manufacturer
paul
lawton
of
brockton
lawton
owns
one
of
the
largest
boot
and
shoe
plants
in
the
states
the
introducer
went
on
you
two
ought
to
find
something
to
talk
about
philip
held
out
his
hand
without
a
single
moment
hesitation
he
was
filled
with
a
new
confidence
i
should
be
delighted
to
talk
with
lawton
on
any
subject
in
the
world
he
declared
except
our
respective
businesses
i
am
very
glad
to
meet
you
sir
the
other
replied
shaking
hands
heartily
i
do
follow
that
last
stipulation
of
yours
though
it
simply
means
that
i
am
taking
seven
days
holiday
philip
explained
gaily
seven
days
during
which
i
have
passed
my
word
to
myself
to
neither
talk
business
nor
think
business
your
very
good
health
raymond
greene
he
went
on
drinking
his
cocktail
with
relish
if
we
meet
on
the
other
side
lawton
we
compare
notes
as
much
as
you
like
that
all
right
sir
the
other
agreed
i
do
know
as
you
not
right
we
americans
do
hang
round
our
businesses
and
that
a
fact
still
there
a
little
matter
of
lasts
i
should
like
to
have
a
word
or
two
with
you
about
some
time
a
little
matter
of
what
philip
asked
vaguely
lasts
the
other
repeated
that
where
your
people
and
ours
look
different
ways
chiefly
that
and
a
little
matter
of
manipulation
of
our
machinery
just
so
philip
assented
swallowing
the
rest
of
his
cocktail
what
about
luncheon
there
nothing
in
the
world
to
give
you
an
appetite
like
this
sea
air
i
with
you
raymond
greene
chimed
in
you
two
can
have
your
trade
talk
later
on
he
took
his
young
friend
arm
and
they
descended
the
stairs
together
what
the
mischief
is
a
last
he
inquired
i
have
the
least
idea
philip
replied
carelessly
something
to
do
with
boots
and
shoes
is
it
his
questioner
stared
at
him
for
a
moment
and
then
laughed
say
you
a
young
man
of
your
word
he
remarked
appreciatively
chapter
vii
philip
romilly
was
accosted
late
that
afternoon
by
two
young
women
whose
presence
on
board
he
had
noticed
with
a
certain
amount
of
disapproval
they
were
obviously
of
the
type
a
fact
which
they
seemed
to
lack
the
ambition
to
conceal
after
several
ingratiating
giggles
they
finally
pulled
up
in
front
of
him
whilst
he
was
promenading
the
deck
you
are
romilly
are
you
one
of
them
asked
bob
millet
told
us
you
were
going
to
be
on
this
steamer
you
know
bob
do
you
philip
for
a
moment
was
taken
aback
bob
millet
he
repeated
thoughtfully
of
course
good
old
bob
i
do
mind
confessing
the
young
woman
went
on
that
though
we
were
all
out
one
night
together
trocadero
empire
and
murray
afterwards
i
should
never
have
recognised
you
seems
to
me
you
got
thinner
and
more
i
am
afraid
my
own
memory
is
also
at
fault
philip
remarked
a
little
stiffly
i
am
violet
fox
the
young
woman
who
had
accosted
him
continued
this
my
friend
hilda
mason
she
a
dear
girl
but
a
little
shy
are
you
hilda
that
just
because
i
told
her
that
we
ought
to
wait
until
you
remembered
us
the
slighter
young
woman
with
the
very
obvious
peroxidised
hair
protested
did
seem
to
be
any
use
waiting
for
that
her
friend
retorted
briskly
hilda
and
i
are
dying
for
a
cocktail
mr
romilly
he
led
them
with
an
unwillingness
of
which
they
seemed
frankly
unaware
towards
the
lounge
they
drank
two
cocktails
and
found
themselves
unfortunately
devoid
of
cigarettes
a
misfortune
which
it
became
his
privilege
to
remedy
they
were
very
friendly
young
ladies
if
a
little
slangy
invited
him
around
to
their
staterooms
and
offered
to
show
him
the
runs
around
new
york
philip
escaped
after
about
an
hour
and
made
his
way
to
where
elizabeth
was
reclining
in
her
deck
chair
that
fellow
romilly
he
declared
irritably
the
other
one
i
mean
seems
to
have
had
the
vilest
tastes
if
i
am
to
be
landed
with
any
more
of
his
ridiculous
indiscretions
i
think
i
shall
have
to
go
overboard
there
was
an
enterprising
gentleman
named
gayes
in
liverpool
who
nearly
drove
me
crazy
then
there
this
lawton
who
wants
to
talk
about
lasts
and
finally
it
seems
that
i
dined
at
the
trocadero
and
spent
the
evening
at
the
empire
and
murray
with
the
two
very
young
ladies
who
accosted
me
just
now
i
am
beginning
to
believe
that
douglas
life
was
not
above
suspicion
she
smiled
at
him
tolerantly
an
unopened
book
lay
by
her
side
she
seemed
to
have
been
spending
the
last
quarter
of
an
hour
in
thought
i
am
rather
relieved
to
hear
she
confessed
that
those
two
young
people
are
a
heritage
from
the
other
romilly
no
do
sit
down
she
went
on
i
want
you
to
do
something
for
me
go
into
the
library
and
on
the
side
as
you
enter
you
will
see
all
the
wireless
news
read
the
bottom
item
and
then
come
back
to
me
he
turned
slowly
away
all
his
buoyancy
of
spirits
had
suddenly
left
him
he
cursed
the
imagination
which
lifted
his
feet
from
the
white
decks
and
dragged
his
eyes
from
the
sparkling
blue
sea
to
the
fields
riven
by
that
long
thread
of
bleak
turgid
water
the
horrors
of
a
murderous
passion
beat
upon
his
brain
he
saw
himself
hastening
grim
and
blind
on
his
mission
then
the
haze
faded
from
before
his
eyes
somehow
or
other
he
accomplished
his
errand
he
was
in
the
library
standing
in
front
of
those
many
sheets
of
typewritten
messages
passing
them
all
over
heedless
of
what
their
message
might
be
until
he
came
to
the
last
and
most
insignificant
four
lines
almost
overlapped
by
another
sheet
strange
disappearance
of
a
london
art
teacher
suicide
feared
acting
upon
instructions
received
the
police
are
investigating
a
somewhat
curious
case
of
disappearance
philip
romilly
a
teacher
of
art
in
a
london
school
visited
detton
magna
on
friday
afternoon
and
apparently
started
for
a
walk
along
the
canal
bank
towards
dusk
nothing
has
since
been
heard
of
him
or
his
movements
and
arrangements
have
been
made
to
drag
the
canal
at
a
certain
point
the
letters
seemed
to
grow
larger
to
him
as
he
stood
and
read
he
remained
in
front
of
the
message
for
an
inordinately
long
time
again
his
imagination
was
at
work
he
saw
the
whole
ghastly
business
the
police
on
the
canal
banks
watching
the
slow
progress
of
the
men
with
their
drags
bringing
to
the
surface
all
the
miserable
refuse
of
the
turgid
waters
the
dripping
black
mud
perhaps
at
last
he
was
back
again
on
the
deck
walking
quite
steadily
yet
seeing
little
he
made
his
way
to
the
smoking
room
asked
almost
indifferently
for
a
brandy
and
soda
and
drained
it
to
the
last
drop
then
he
walked
up
the
deck
to
where
elizabeth
was
seated
and
dropped
into
a
chair
by
her
side
so
i
am
missing
he
remarked
almost
in
his
ordinary
tone
i
really
had
no
idea
that
i
was
a
person
of
such
importance
fancy
reading
of
my
own
disappearance
within
a
few
days
of
its
taking
place
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
there
was
probably
some
one
there
who
gave
information
she
suggested
there
was
the
young
lady
whom
i
went
to
visit
he
assented
she
probably
watched
me
cross
the
road
and
turn
in
at
that
gate
and
take
the
path
by
the
canal
side
yes
she
may
even
have
gone
to
the
station
to
see
whether
i
took
the
only
other
train
back
to
london
and
found
that
i
did
not
she
knew
too
that
i
could
only
have
had
a
few
shillings
in
my
pocket
and
that
my
living
depended
upon
being
in
london
for
my
school
the
next
morning
yes
the
whole
thing
was
reasonable
and
they
are
going
to
drag
the
canal
elizabeth
said
thoughtfully
a
difficult
business
he
assured
her
it
is
one
of
the
most
ghastly
filthiest
strips
of
water
you
ever
looked
upon
it
has
been
the
garbage
depository
of
the
villages
through
which
it
makes
its
beastly
way
for
generations
i
do
envy
the
men
who
have
to
handle
the
drags
you
do
not
believe
then
that
they
will
find
anything
interesting
he
shrugged
his
shoulders
that
type
of
man
he
continued
must
have
a
morbid
mind
there
will
be
dead
animals
without
a
doubt
boots
filthy
and
decomposed
articles
of
clothing
do
she
interrupted
you
know
what
i
mean
do
leave
off
painting
your
ghastly
pictures
you
know
quite
well
what
i
mean
philip
romilly
is
here
by
my
side
what
can
they
hope
to
find
there
in
his
place
his
evil
moments
for
that
afternoon
were
over
he
answered
her
almost
carelessly
not
what
they
are
looking
for
have
you
brought
the
paper
and
pencil
you
spoke
of
i
have
an
idea
i
am
getting
fresh
ideas
every
moment
now
that
i
picture
you
as
my
heroine
it
is
queer
is
it
how
naturally
you
fall
into
the
role
she
drew
a
little
nearer
to
him
he
was
conscious
of
a
mysterious
and
unfamiliar
perfume
perhaps
from
the
violets
half
hidden
in
her
furs
or
was
it
something
in
her
hair
it
reminded
him
a
little
of
the
world
the
keys
into
which
he
had
gripped
the
world
of
joyousness
of
pleasures
the
sunlit
world
into
which
he
had
only
looked
through
other
men
eyes
perhaps
you
knew
that
i
was
somewhere
across
the
threshold
she
suggested
did
you
drag
your
mona
wholly
from
your
brain
or
has
she
her
prototype
somewhere
in
your
world
he
shook
his
head
therein
lies
the
weakness
of
all
that
i
have
ever
written
he
declared
there
have
been
so
few
in
my
world
from
whom
i
could
garner
even
the
gleanings
of
a
personality
they
are
all
my
men
and
women
artificially
made
not
born
shillings
a
week
has
kept
me
well
outside
the
locked
doors
yet
you
know
in
many
ways
she
reflected
mona
is
like
me
like
you
because
she
was
a
helper
of
men
he
assented
swiftly
a
woman
of
large
sympathies
appealing
to
me
i
suppose
because
in
my
solitude
thoughts
of
my
own
weakness
taunted
me
weakness
because
i
could
break
out
i
mean
perhaps
for
that
reason
the
thought
of
a
strong
woman
fascinated
me
a
woman
large
in
thoughts
and
ways
a
woman
to
whom
purposes
and
tendencies
counted
most
i
dreamed
of
a
woman
sweetly
omnipotent
strong
without
a
shadow
of
masculinity
that
is
where
my
mona
was
to
be
different
from
all
other
created
figures
chance
she
declared
is
a
wonderful
thing
chance
has
pitchforked
you
here
absolutely
to
my
side
i
the
one
woman
who
could
understand
what
you
mean
who
could
give
your
mona
life
do
think
i
am
vain
she
went
on
i
can
assure
you
that
my
head
is
the
least
turned
because
i
have
been
successful
i
simply
know
listen
i
have
few
engagements
in
new
york
i
should
not
be
going
back
at
all
but
to
see
my
mother
who
is
too
delicate
to
travel
and
who
is
miserable
when
i
am
away
for
long
take
this
pencil
and
paper
let
us
leave
off
dreaming
for
a
little
time
and
give
ourselves
up
to
technicalities
i
want
to
draft
a
new
first
act
and
a
new
last
one
not
so
very
different
from
your
version
and
yet
with
changes
which
i
want
to
explain
as
we
go
on
bring
your
chair
a
little
nearer
so
now
take
down
these
notes
they
worked
until
the
first
gong
for
dinner
rang
she
sat
up
in
her
chair
with
a
happy
little
laugh
is
it
wonderful
she
exclaimed
i
never
knew
time
to
pass
so
quickly
there
is
any
pleasure
in
the
world
like
this
she
added
a
little
impulsively
the
pleasure
of
letting
your
thoughts
run
out
to
meet
some
one
else
some
one
who
understands
take
care
of
every
line
we
have
written
my
friend
we
might
go
on
after
dinner
he
suggested
eagerly
she
shook
her
head
i
rather
not
she
admitted
my
brain
is
too
full
i
have
a
hundred
fancies
dancing
about
i
even
find
myself
as
we
sit
here
rehearsing
my
gestures
tuning
myself
to
a
new
outlook
oh
you
most
disturbing
person
intellectually
of
course
i
mean
she
added
laughing
into
his
face
take
off
my
rugs
and
help
me
up
no
we
leave
them
there
perhaps
after
dinner
we
might
walk
for
a
little
time
but
the
whole
thing
is
tingling
in
my
brain
he
protested
could
we
go
into
the
library
we
could
find
a
corner
by
ourselves
she
turned
and
looked
at
him
standing
up
now
the
wind
blowing
her
skirts
her
eyes
glowing
her
lips
a
little
parted
then
for
the
first
time
he
understood
her
beauty
understood
the
peculiar
qualities
of
it
the
dissensions
of
the
press
as
to
her
appearance
the
supreme
charm
of
a
woman
possessed
of
a
sweet
and
passionate
temperament
turning
her
face
towards
the
sun
even
the
greater
things
caught
hold
of
him
in
that
moment
and
he
felt
dimly
what
was
coming
do
you
really
wish
to
work
she
asked
he
looked
away
from
her
no
he
answered
a
little
thickly
we
will
talk
if
you
will
they
neither
of
them
moved
the
atmosphere
had
suddenly
become
charged
with
a
force
indescribable
almost
numbing
in
the
far
distance
they
saw
the
level
line
of
lights
from
a
passing
steamer
raymond
greene
with
his
hands
in
his
ulster
pockets
suddenly
spotted
them
and
did
for
them
what
they
seemed
to
have
lost
the
power
to
do
hullo
he
exclaimed
i
been
looking
for
you
two
everywhere
i
want
to
hurt
that
smoking
room
steward
feelings
he
not
bad
at
his
job
but
he
added
confidentially
dropping
his
voice
and
taking
them
both
by
the
arm
i
have
made
a
cocktail
down
in
my
stateroom
there
in
the
shaker
waiting
for
us
something
i
ca
talk
about
given
lawton
one
and
he
following
me
about
like
a
dog
come
right
this
way
both
of
you
steady
across
the
gangway
she
pitching
a
little
why
you
look
kind
of
scared
romilly
been
to
sleep
either
of
you
philip
laugh
was
almost
too
long
to
be
natural
elizabeth
as
though
by
accident
had
dropped
her
veil
raymond
greene
bubbling
over
with
good
nature
and
anticipation
led
them
towards
the
stairs
chapter
viii
raymond
greene
could
scarcely
wait
until
philip
had
taken
his
place
at
the
dinner
table
that
evening
to
make
known
his
latest
discovery
say
romilly
he
exclaimed
leaning
a
little
forward
do
you
happen
to
have
seen
the
wireless
messages
those
tissue
sheets
that
are
stuck
up
in
the
library
philip
set
down
the
menu
in
which
he
had
been
taking
an
unusual
interest
yes
i
looked
through
them
this
afternoon
he
acknowledged
there
a
little
one
at
the
bottom
looks
as
though
it
had
been
shoved
in
at
the
last
moment
i
do
know
whether
you
noticed
it
it
announced
the
mysterious
disappearance
of
a
young
man
of
the
same
name
as
your
own
an
art
teacher
from
london
i
think
he
was
i
wondered
whether
it
might
have
been
any
relation
i
read
the
message
philip
admitted
it
certainly
looks
as
though
it
might
have
referred
to
my
cousin
raymond
greene
became
almost
impressive
in
his
interested
earnestness
talk
about
coincidences
he
continued
do
you
remember
last
night
talking
about
subjects
for
cinema
plays
i
told
you
of
a
little
incident
i
happened
to
have
noticed
on
the
way
from
london
to
liverpool
about
the
two
men
somewhere
in
derbyshire
whom
i
had
seen
approaching
a
tunnel
over
a
canal
they
neither
of
them
came
out
you
know
all
the
time
that
the
train
was
standing
there
philip
helped
himself
a
little
absently
to
whisky
and
soda
from
the
bottle
in
front
of
him
i
remember
your
professional
interest
in
the
situation
he
confessed
i
felt
at
the
time
raymond
greene
went
on
eagerly
that
there
was
something
queer
about
the
affair
listen
i
have
been
putting
two
and
two
together
and
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
those
men
might
very
well
have
been
this
missing
mr
romilly
philip
shook
his
head
pensively
i
do
think
so
he
ventured
what
that
you
do
think
so
the
cinema
magnate
exclaimed
why
not
romilly
it
exactly
the
district
at
detton
magna
the
message
said
in
derbyshire
and
it
was
a
canal
too
one
of
the
filthiest
i
ever
saw
ca
you
realise
the
dramatic
interest
of
the
situation
now
that
you
are
confronted
with
this
case
of
disappearance
i
have
been
asking
myself
ever
since
i
strolled
up
into
the
library
before
dinner
and
read
this
notice
about
the
other
philip
had
commenced
a
leisurely
consumption
of
his
first
course
and
answered
without
undue
haste
well
he
said
if
this
young
man
romilly
is
my
cousin
it
would
be
the
second
or
third
time
already
that
he
has
disappeared
he
is
an
neurotic
sort
of
creature
at
times
he
accepts
help
even
solicits
it
from
his
more
prosperous
relations
and
at
times
he
speak
to
us
but
of
one
thing
i
am
perfectly
convinced
and
that
is
that
there
is
no
man
in
the
world
who
would
be
less
likely
to
make
away
with
himself
he
has
a
nervous
horror
of
death
or
pain
of
any
sort
and
in
his
peculiar
way
he
is
much
too
fond
of
life
ever
to
dream
of
voluntarily
shortening
it
on
the
other
hand
he
is
always
doing
eccentric
things
he
probably
set
out
to
walk
to
london
i
have
known
him
do
it
before
and
will
turn
up
there
in
a
fortnight
time
raymond
greene
seemed
rather
to
resent
having
cold
water
poured
upon
his
melodramatic
imaginings
he
turned
to
elizabeth
who
had
remained
silent
during
the
brief
colloquy
what
do
you
think
miss
dalstan
he
asked
do
you
think
that
under
the
circumstances
i
ought
to
give
information
to
the
british
police
she
laughed
at
him
quite
and
yet
in
such
a
way
that
a
less
sensitive
man
than
raymond
greene
might
well
have
been
conscious
of
the
note
of
ridicule
no
wonder
you
are
such
a
great
success
in
your
profession
she
observed
you
carry
the
melodramatic
instinct
with
you
day
by
day
you
see
everything
through
the
dramatist
spectacles
that
all
very
well
greene
protested
but
you
saw
the
two
men
yourself
and
you
probably
read
about
the
case
of
mysterious
disappearance
surely
you
must
admit
that
the
coincidence
is
interesting
alas
she
went
on
shaking
her
head
i
am
afraid
i
must
throw
cold
water
upon
your
vivid
imaginings
you
see
my
eyesight
is
better
than
yours
and
i
could
see
the
two
men
distinctly
whilst
you
could
only
see
their
figures
one
of
them
the
was
fair
and
obviously
affluent
and
the
other
was
a
labourer
neither
of
them
could
in
any
way
have
answered
the
description
of
the
missing
man
raymond
greene
was
a
little
dashed
you
did
say
so
at
the
time
he
complained
i
really
was
sufficiently
interested
she
told
him
besides
without
knowing
anything
of
romilly
cousin
i
do
think
any
person
in
the
world
could
have
had
the
courage
to
seek
an
exit
from
his
troubles
by
means
of
that
canal
but
my
point
raymond
greene
persisted
is
that
it
was
suicide
at
all
i
maintain
that
the
situation
as
i
saw
it
presented
all
the
possibilities
of
a
different
sort
of
crime
my
cousin
had
an
enemy
in
the
world
except
himself
philip
intervened
and
i
would
give
you
the
filming
of
my
next
play
for
nothing
elizabeth
ventured
if
either
of
those
two
men
could
possibly
have
been
an
art
teacher
can
i
have
a
little
more
oil
with
my
salad
please
steward
and
i
should
like
some
french
white
wine
raymond
greene
took
what
appeared
to
be
a
positive
disappointment
very
well
he
said
i
dare
say
you
are
both
right
and
in
any
case
i
should
like
to
persist
in
a
point
of
view
which
might
naturally
enough
become
distressing
to
our
young
friend
here
tell
you
what
i
do
to
show
my
penitence
i
shall
order
a
bottle
of
wine
and
we
drink
to
the
welfare
of
the
missing
philip
romilly
wherever
he
may
be
pommery
steward
and
bring
some
ice
along
philip
pushed
away
his
whisky
and
soda
just
in
time
he
remarked
i
drink
to
poor
philip
welfare
with
pleasure
although
he
has
been
an
unmixed
blessing
to
his
family
the
subject
passed
away
with
the
drinking
of
the
toast
and
with
the
necessity
for
a
guard
upon
himself
gone
philip
found
himself
eating
and
drinking
mechanically
watching
all
the
time
the
woman
who
sat
opposite
to
him
who
had
now
engaged
raymond
greene
in
an
animated
conversation
on
the
subject
of
the
suitability
for
filming
of
certain
recent
plays
he
was
trying
with
a
curious
intentness
to
study
her
dispassionately
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
charm
on
which
dramatic
critics
had
wasted
a
wealth
of
adjectives
and
of
which
he
himself
was
humanly
and
personally
conscious
she
wore
a
gown
of
some
soft
black
material
with
a
little
lace
at
her
throat
fastened
by
her
only
article
of
jewellery
a
pearl
pin
her
hair
was
arranged
in
coils
with
a
simplicity
and
a
precision
which
to
a
more
experienced
observer
would
have
indicated
the
possession
of
a
maid
of
no
ordinary
qualities
her
mouth
became
more
and
more
delightful
every
time
he
studied
it
her
voice
even
her
method
of
speech
were
entirely
natural
and
with
a
peculiarly
fascinating
inflexion
at
times
she
looked
and
spoke
with
the
gaiety
of
a
child
then
again
there
was
the
grave
and
cultured
woman
apparent
in
her
and
thoughtful
criticisms
when
at
the
end
of
the
meal
she
rose
to
leave
the
table
he
found
himself
surprised
at
her
height
and
the
slim
perfection
of
her
figure
his
first
remark
when
he
joined
her
upon
the
stairs
was
an
almost
abrupt
expression
of
his
thoughts
tell
me
he
exclaimed
why
were
all
my
first
impressions
of
you
wrong
you
are
a
revelation
to
me
you
are
amazingly
different
she
laughed
at
him
i
really
ca
do
more
than
show
you
myself
as
i
am
she
expostulated
ah
but
you
are
so
many
women
he
murmured
of
course
if
you
are
going
to
flatter
me
give
me
a
cigarette
from
my
case
please
and
strike
a
match
and
if
you
do
mind
struggling
with
this
wind
and
the
darkness
we
will
have
our
walk
there
she
added
as
they
stood
in
the
companionway
now
do
you
feel
as
though
we
were
facing
an
adventure
we
sha
be
able
to
see
a
yard
ahead
of
us
and
the
wind
is
singing
they
passed
through
up
the
companionway
she
took
his
arm
and
he
suddenly
felt
the
touch
of
her
warm
fingers
feeling
for
his
other
hand
he
gripped
them
tightly
and
his
last
impression
of
her
face
before
they
plunged
into
the
darkness
was
of
a
queer
softness
as
though
she
were
giving
herself
up
to
some
unexpected
but
welcome
emotion
her
eyes
were
half
closed
she
had
the
air
of
one
wrapped
in
silence
so
they
walked
almost
the
whole
length
of
the
deck
philip
indeed
had
no
impulse
or
desire
for
speech
all
his
aching
nerves
were
soothed
into
repose
the
last
remnants
of
his
ghostly
fears
had
been
swept
away
they
were
on
the
windward
side
of
the
ship
untenanted
save
now
and
then
by
the
shadowy
forms
of
other
promenaders
the
whole
experience
even
the
regular
throbbing
of
the
engines
the
swish
of
the
sea
the
rising
and
falling
of
a
lantern
bound
to
the
top
of
a
fishing
smack
by
which
they
were
passing
the
distant
chant
of
the
changing
watch
all
the
night
sights
and
sounds
of
the
seaborne
hostel
were
unfamiliar
and
exhilarating
and
inside
his
hand
even
though
given
him
of
her
great
pity
a
woman
fingers
lay
in
his
she
spoke
at
last
a
little
abruptly
there
is
something
i
must
know
about
she
said
you
have
only
to
ask
he
assured
her
do
be
afraid
she
continued
i
wish
to
ask
you
nothing
which
might
give
you
pain
but
i
must
know
you
see
i
am
really
such
a
ordinary
woman
i
must
know
about
some
one
whom
you
went
to
visit
that
day
you
at
detton
magna
he
answered
her
almost
eagerly
i
want
to
talk
about
beatrice
he
declared
i
want
to
tell
you
everything
about
her
i
know
that
you
will
understand
we
were
brought
up
together
in
the
same
country
place
we
were
both
thrown
upon
the
world
about
the
same
time
that
was
one
thing
i
suppose
which
made
us
kindly
disposed
towards
one
another
we
corresponded
always
i
commenced
my
unsuccessful
fight
in
london
i
lived
i
ca
tell
you
how
week
by
week
month
by
month
i
ate
coarse
food
i
was
a
to
the
fringe
of
everything
in
life
which
appealed
to
me
fed
intellectually
on
the
crumbs
of
free
libraries
and
picture
galleries
i
met
no
one
of
my
own
station
i
was
at
a
public
school
and
my
people
were
gentlefolk
or
tastes
i
had
no
friends
in
london
before
whom
i
dared
present
myself
no
money
to
join
a
club
where
i
might
have
mixed
with
my
fellows
no
one
to
talk
to
or
exchange
a
single
idea
with
and
i
was
always
the
gloomy
sort
of
person
i
have
become
in
my
younger
days
i
loved
companionship
and
the
women
my
landlady
daughter
with
dyed
hair
a
loud
voice
slatternly
in
the
morning
a
flagrant
imitation
of
her
less
honest
sisters
at
night
who
else
where
was
i
to
meet
women
when
i
did
even
know
men
i
spent
my
poor
holidays
at
detton
magna
our
very
loneliness
brought
beatrice
and
me
closer
together
we
used
to
walk
in
those
ugly
fields
around
detton
magna
and
exchanged
the
story
of
our
woes
she
was
a
teacher
at
the
national
school
the
children
were
pleasant
their
parents
were
worse
the
drudgery
was
horrible
and
there
was
any
escape
for
her
sometimes
she
would
sob
as
we
sat
side
by
side
she
too
wanted
something
out
of
life
as
i
did
and
there
seemed
nothing
but
that
black
wall
always
before
us
i
think
that
we
clung
together
because
we
shared
a
common
misery
we
talked
endlessly
of
a
way
out
for
me
what
was
there
there
was
no
one
to
rob
i
was
clever
enough
there
was
no
way
i
could
earn
money
honestly
or
dishonestly
and
for
her
buried
in
that
derbyshire
village
amongst
the
collieries
where
there
was
scarcely
a
person
who
had
the
taint
of
the
place
upon
them
what
chance
was
there
for
her
there
was
nothing
she
could
do
either
i
knew
in
my
heart
that
we
were
both
ready
for
evil
things
if
by
evil
things
we
could
make
our
escape
and
we
could
so
we
tried
to
lose
ourselves
in
the
only
fields
left
for
such
as
we
we
read
poetry
we
tried
to
live
in
that
unnatural
world
where
the
brains
only
are
nourished
and
the
body
languishes
it
was
a
morbid
unhealthy
existence
but
i
plodded
along
and
so
did
she
then
her
weekly
letters
became
different
for
the
first
time
she
wrote
me
with
reserves
i
took
a
day
vacation
and
i
went
down
to
detton
magna
to
see
what
had
happened
that
was
the
day
she
interrupted
softly
when
that
was
the
day
he
assented
i
remember
so
well
getting
out
of
the
train
and
walking
up
that
long
miserable
street
school
over
and
i
went
straight
to
her
cottage
as
i
have
often
done
before
there
was
a
change
her
cheap
furniture
had
gone
it
was
like
one
of
those
little
rooms
we
had
dreamed
of
there
was
a
soft
carpet
upon
the
floor
chippendale
furniture
flowers
hothouse
fruit
and
on
the
mantelpiece
the
photograph
of
a
man
he
paused
and
they
took
the
whole
one
long
turn
along
the
shadowy
deck
in
silence
presently
she
came
he
continued
the
change
was
there
too
she
was
dressed
simply
enough
but
even
i
in
my
inexperience
knew
the
difference
she
came
in
she
who
had
spoken
of
suicide
a
short
time
ago
singing
softly
to
herself
she
saw
me
our
eyes
met
and
the
story
was
told
i
knew
and
she
knew
that
i
knew
it
seemed
as
though
something
in
his
tone
might
have
grated
upon
her
gently
but
with
a
certain
firmness
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
his
you
were
very
angry
i
suppose
she
murmured
some
instinct
told
him
exactly
what
was
passing
in
her
thoughts
in
a
moment
he
was
on
the
defensive
i
think
he
said
that
if
it
had
been
any
other
man
but
listen
the
photograph
which
i
took
from
the
mantelpiece
and
threw
into
the
fire
was
the
photograph
of
my
own
cousin
his
father
and
my
father
were
brought
up
together
my
father
chose
the
church
his
founded
the
factory
in
which
most
of
the
people
in
detton
magna
were
employed
when
my
grandfather
died
it
was
found
that
he
was
penniless
the
whole
of
his
money
had
gone
towards
founding
the
douglas
romilly
shoe
company
i
wo
weary
with
the
details
the
business
prospered
but
we
remained
in
poverty
when
my
mother
died
i
was
left
with
nothing
my
uncle
made
promises
and
never
kept
them
he
too
died
my
cousin
and
i
quarrelled
he
and
his
father
both
held
that
the
money
advanced
by
my
grandfather
had
been
a
gift
and
not
a
loan
they
offered
me
a
pittance
well
i
refused
anything
i
spoke
plain
words
and
that
was
an
end
of
it
and
then
i
came
back
and
i
saw
his
picture
my
cousin
picture
upon
the
mantelpiece
i
can
see
it
now
and
it
looks
hateful
to
me
all
the
old
fires
burned
up
in
me
i
remembered
my
father
death
a
pauper
he
was
i
remembered
how
near
i
had
been
to
starvation
i
remembered
the
years
i
had
spent
in
a
garret
whilst
douglas
had
idled
time
away
at
oxford
had
left
there
to
trifle
with
the
business
his
father
had
founded
had
his
west
end
club
hunters
and
shooting
it
was
a
vicious
mad
jealous
hatred
perhaps
but
i
claim
that
it
was
human
i
went
out
of
that
little
house
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
there
was
a
new
lust
in
my
heart
a
new
craving
desire
if
i
had
thrown
myself
into
that
canal
they
might
well
have
called
it
temporary
insanity
i
did
but
i
was
mad
all
the
same
anything
else
i
did
was
temporary
insanity
her
hand
suddenly
came
back
again
and
she
leaned
towards
him
through
the
darkness
you
poor
child
she
whispered
stop
there
please
do
be
afraid
to
think
you
told
me
this
you
see
i
am
of
the
world
and
i
know
that
we
are
all
only
human
now
twice
up
and
down
the
deck
and
not
a
word
then
i
shall
ask
you
something
so
they
passed
on
side
by
side
the
touch
of
her
fingers
keeping
this
new
courage
alive
in
his
heart
his
head
uplifted
even
to
the
stars
towards
which
their
rolling
mast
pointed
it
was
wonderful
this
to
tell
the
truth
to
open
the
door
of
his
heart
now
i
am
going
to
ask
you
something
she
said
when
they
turned
for
the
third
time
you
may
think
it
a
strange
question
but
you
must
please
answer
it
to
me
it
is
rather
important
just
what
were
your
feelings
for
beatrice
i
think
i
was
fond
of
her
he
answered
thoughtfully
i
know
that
i
hated
her
when
she
came
in
from
the
schoolhouse
when
i
understood
both
of
us
in
the
days
of
our
joint
poverty
had
scoffed
at
principles
had
spoken
boldly
enough
of
sin
but
i
can
only
say
that
when
she
came
when
i
looked
into
her
eyes
i
seemed
to
have
discovered
a
new
horror
in
life
i
ca
analyse
it
i
am
not
sure
even
now
that
i
was
not
more
of
a
beast
that
i
had
thought
myself
i
am
not
sure
that
part
of
my
rage
was
not
because
she
had
escaped
and
i
could
but
your
personal
feelings
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
about
she
persisted
he
dug
down
into
his
consciousness
to
satisfy
her
think
of
what
my
life
in
london
had
been
he
reminded
her
there
was
a
single
woman
i
knew
with
whom
i
could
exchange
a
word
all
the
time
i
loved
beautiful
things
and
beautiful
women
and
the
thought
of
them
i
have
gone
out
into
the
streets
at
nights
sometimes
and
hung
around
the
entrances
to
theatres
and
restaurants
just
for
the
pleasure
of
looking
at
them
with
other
men
it
did
do
me
any
good
you
know
but
the
desire
was
there
i
wanted
a
companion
like
those
other
men
had
beatrice
was
the
only
woman
i
knew
i
did
choose
her
it
was
the
selective
instinct
that
made
her
attractive
to
me
it
was
because
she
was
the
only
one
i
never
felt
anything
great
when
i
was
with
her
he
went
on
hoarsely
i
knew
very
well
that
ours
were
ordinary
feelings
she
was
in
the
same
position
that
i
was
there
was
no
one
else
for
her
either
do
you
want
me
to
go
on
she
hesitated
do
be
afraid
i
am
not
quite
mad
he
continued
only
i
answer
for
you
the
part
of
your
question
you
do
put
into
words
beatrice
was
nothing
to
me
but
an
interpretress
of
her
sex
i
never
loved
her
if
i
had
we
might
in
our
misery
have
done
the
wildest
the
most
foolish
things
i
will
tell
you
why
i
know
so
clearly
that
i
never
loved
her
i
have
known
it
since
you
have
been
kind
to
me
since
i
have
realised
what
a
wonderful
thing
a
woman
can
be
what
a
world
she
can
make
for
the
man
who
cares
whom
she
cares
for
her
fingers
gripped
his
tightly
and
now
she
said
i
know
all
that
i
want
to
know
and
all
that
it
is
well
for
us
to
speak
of
just
now
dear
friend
will
you
remember
that
you
are
sharing
your
burden
with
me
and
that
i
who
am
accounted
something
in
the
world
and
who
know
life
pretty
thoroughly
believe
in
you
and
hope
for
you
they
paused
for
a
moment
by
the
side
of
the
steamer
rail
she
understood
so
well
his
speechlessness
she
drew
her
hand
away
from
his
and
held
it
to
his
lips
please
kiss
my
fingers
she
begged
that
is
just
the
seal
of
our
friendship
in
these
days
see
how
quickly
we
seem
to
plough
our
way
through
the
water
listen
to
the
throbbing
of
that
engine
always
towards
a
new
world
for
you
my
friend
it
is
to
be
an
undiscovered
country
be
brave
keep
on
being
brave
and
remember
the
words
seemed
to
die
away
upon
her
lips
a
shower
of
spray
came
glittering
into
the
dim
light
like
flakes
of
snow
falling
with
unexpected
violence
close
to
them
he
drew
her
cloak
around
her
and
moved
back
now
she
said
i
think
we
will
smoke
and
perhaps
if
you
made
yourself
very
agreeable
to
the
steward
in
the
smoking
room
you
could
get
some
coffee
one
moment
he
pleaded
remember
what
do
you
realise
that
there
is
just
one
word
i
still
need
one
little
word
to
crown
all
that
you
have
said
she
turned
her
head
towards
him
the
trouble
and
brooding
melancholy
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
his
face
she
realised
more
fully
its
sensitive
lines
its
poetic
almost
passionate
charm
she
was
carried
suddenly
away
upon
a
wave
of
the
emotion
which
she
herself
had
created
oh
but
you
know
she
faltered
you
see
i
trust
you
even
to
know
when
now
your
arm
please
until
we
reach
the
smoking
room
and
mind
i
must
have
coffee
chapter
ix
philip
romilly
on
the
last
day
of
the
voyage
experienced
to
the
full
that
peculiar
sensation
of
unrest
which
seems
inevitably
to
prevail
when
an
oceangoing
steamer
is
being
slowly
towed
into
port
the
winds
of
the
ocean
had
been
left
behind
there
was
a
new
but
pleasant
chill
in
the
frosty
sunlit
air
the
great
buildings
of
new
york
at
which
he
had
been
gazing
for
hours
were
standing
heterogeneous
but
magnificent
against
an
azure
sky
the
ferry
boats
with
their
amazing
human
cargo
seemed
to
be
screeching
a
welcome
as
they
churned
their
way
across
the
busy
river
wherever
he
looked
there
was
something
novel
and
interesting
yet
nothing
sufficiently
arresting
to
enable
him
to
forget
that
he
was
face
to
face
now
with
the
first
crisis
of
his
new
life
since
that
brief
wireless
message
on
the
first
day
out
there
had
been
nothing
disquieting
in
the
daily
bulletins
of
news
and
he
had
been
able
to
appreciate
to
the
full
the
soothing
sense
of
detachment
the
friendliness
of
his
fellow
voyagers
immeasurably
above
all
the
daily
association
with
elizabeth
he
felt
like
one
awaking
from
a
dream
as
he
realised
that
these
things
were
over
at
the
first
sight
of
land
it
was
as
though
a
magician
wand
had
been
waved
a
charm
broken
his
fellow
passengers
in
unfamiliar
costumes
were
standing
about
with
their
eyes
glued
upon
the
distant
docks
a
queer
sense
of
ostracism
possessed
him
perhaps
after
all
it
had
been
a
dream
from
which
he
was
now
slowly
awaking
he
wandered
into
the
lounge
to
find
elizabeth
surrounded
by
a
little
group
of
journalists
she
nodded
to
him
pleasantly
and
waved
a
great
bunch
of
pink
roses
which
one
of
them
had
brought
to
her
her
greeting
saved
him
from
despair
she
at
least
was
unchanged
see
how
my
friends
are
beginning
to
spoil
me
she
cried
out
really
i
ca
tell
any
of
you
a
thing
more
she
went
on
turning
back
to
them
only
this
and
i
am
sure
it
ought
to
be
interesting
i
have
discovered
a
new
dramatist
and
i
am
going
to
produce
a
play
of
his
within
three
months
i
hope
i
sha
tell
you
his
name
and
i
sha
tell
you
anything
about
the
play
except
that
i
find
more
promise
in
it
than
anything
i
have
seen
or
read
for
months
romilly
please
wait
for
me
she
called
after
him
i
want
to
point
out
some
of
the
buildings
to
you
a
dark
young
man
wearing
eyeglasses
with
a
notebook
and
pencil
in
his
hand
swung
around
is
this
douglas
romilly
he
enquired
of
the
romilly
shoe
company
i
am
from
the
york
pleased
to
meet
you
romilly
you
are
over
here
on
business
we
understand
philip
was
taken
aback
and
for
the
moment
remained
speechless
we
like
to
know
your
reason
romilly
for
paying
us
a
visit
the
young
man
continued
in
your
own
words
how
long
a
trip
do
you
intend
to
make
anyway
what
might
your
output
be
in
england
per
week
shoes
and
misses
is
it
elizabeth
intervened
swiftly
shaking
her
finger
at
the
journalist
harris
she
said
romilly
is
my
friend
and
i
am
not
going
to
have
him
spend
these
few
impressive
moments
when
he
ought
to
be
looking
about
him
at
the
harbour
telling
you
silly
details
about
his
business
you
can
call
upon
him
at
his
hotel
if
you
like
the
waldorf
he
is
going
to
i
believe
and
i
am
sure
he
will
tell
you
anything
you
want
to
know
that
all
right
miss
dalstan
the
young
man
declared
soothingly
see
you
later
romilly
he
added
maybe
you
let
us
have
a
few
of
your
impressions
to
work
in
with
the
other
stuff
romilly
made
light
of
the
matter
but
there
was
a
slight
frown
upon
his
forehead
as
they
passed
along
the
curiously
stationary
deck
i
am
afraid
he
observed
that
this
is
going
to
be
a
terribly
hard
country
to
disappear
in
do
you
believe
it
she
replied
cheerfully
you
arrive
here
and
you
are
in
request
everywhere
you
are
forgotten
some
one
else
arrives
that
newspaper
man
scarcely
remembers
your
existence
at
the
present
moment
he
has
discovered
raymond
greene
tell
me
why
do
you
look
so
white
and
unhappy
i
am
sorry
the
voyage
is
over
he
confessed
so
am
i
for
that
matter
she
assented
i
have
loved
every
minute
of
the
last
few
days
but
then
we
knew
all
the
time
did
we
that
it
was
just
an
interlude
the
things
which
lie
before
us
are
so
full
of
interest
it
is
the
next
few
hours
which
i
fear
he
muttered
gloomily
she
laughed
at
him
foolish
if
there
had
been
any
one
on
this
side
who
wanted
to
ask
you
disagreeable
questions
they
would
have
waited
to
meet
you
on
the
quay
they
have
come
down
the
harbour
and
held
us
up
do
think
about
that
for
a
moment
think
instead
of
all
the
wonderful
things
we
are
going
to
do
you
will
be
occupied
every
minute
of
the
time
until
i
come
back
to
new
york
and
i
shall
be
so
anxious
to
see
the
result
you
disappoint
me
will
you
i
will
not
he
promised
it
was
only
for
just
a
moment
that
i
felt
an
idiot
it
exciting
you
know
this
new
atmosphere
and
the
voyage
was
so
wonderful
such
a
perfect
rest
it
like
waking
up
and
the
daylight
seems
a
little
crude
she
held
out
her
hand
you
see
the
gangways
are
going
down
she
pointed
out
i
can
see
many
of
my
friends
waiting
remember
with
your
new
life
begins
our
new
alliance
good
luck
to
you
dear
friend
their
fingers
were
locked
for
a
moment
together
he
looked
earnestly
into
her
eyes
whatever
the
new
life
may
mean
for
me
he
said
fervently
i
shall
owe
to
you
a
little
rush
of
people
came
up
the
gangway
and
elizabeth
was
speedily
surrounded
and
carried
off
they
came
across
one
another
several
times
in
the
custom
house
and
she
waved
her
hand
to
him
gaily
philip
went
through
the
usual
formalities
superintended
the
hoisting
of
his
trunks
upon
a
clumsy
motor
truck
and
was
himself
driven
without
question
from
the
covered
shed
adjoining
the
quay
he
looked
back
at
the
huge
side
of
the
steamer
the
floor
of
the
custom
house
about
which
were
still
dotted
little
crowds
of
his
fellow
passengers
it
was
the
disintegration
of
a
wonderful
memory
his
farewell
at
the
waldorf
he
found
himself
greeted
with
unexpected
cordiality
the
young
gentleman
to
whom
he
applied
after
some
hesitation
for
a
room
stretched
out
his
hand
and
welcomed
him
to
america
so
you
are
mr
romilly
he
exclaimed
well
that
good
we
got
your
room
number
on
the
ninth
floor
ninth
floor
philip
gasped
if
you
like
to
be
higher
up
we
can
change
you
the
young
man
continued
amiably
been
several
people
here
enquiring
for
you
a
young
man
from
the
and
shoe
trades
reporter
was
here
only
half
an
hour
ago
and
here
a
cable
no
mail
yet
he
handed
the
key
to
a
small
boy
and
waved
philip
away
the
small
boy
proved
fully
equal
to
his
mission
you
just
step
this
way
sir
he
invited
encouragingly
those
packages
of
yours
will
be
all
right
you
do
need
to
worry
about
them
he
led
the
way
down
a
corridor
streaming
with
human
beings
into
a
lift
from
which
it
appeared
to
philip
that
he
was
shot
on
to
the
ninth
floor
along
a
way
into
a
and
comfortable
bedroom
with
bathroom
attached
your
things
will
be
up
directly
sir
the
small
boy
promised
holding
out
his
hand
i
see
after
them
myself
philip
expressed
his
gratitude
in
a
satisfactory
manner
and
stood
for
a
few
moments
at
the
window
although
it
was
practically
his
first
glimpse
of
new
york
the
wonders
of
the
panorama
over
which
he
looked
failed
even
to
excite
his
curiosity
the
clanging
of
the
surface
cars
the
roar
and
clatter
of
the
overhead
railway
the
hooting
of
streams
of
automobiles
all
apparently
being
driven
at
breakneck
speed
alien
sounds
though
they
were
fell
upon
deaf
ears
he
could
neither
listen
nor
observe
every
second
delay
fretted
him
his
plans
were
all
made
everything
depended
upon
their
being
carried
out
now
without
the
slightest
hitch
he
walked
a
dozen
times
to
the
door
waiting
for
his
luggage
and
when
at
last
it
arrived
he
was
on
the
point
of
using
the
telephone
he
feed
the
porters
and
dismissed
them
as
rapidly
as
possible
then
he
ransacked
the
trunks
until
he
found
amidst
a
pile
of
fashionable
clothing
a
quiet
and
inconspicuous
suit
of
dark
grey
in
the
bathroom
he
hastily
changed
his
clothes
selected
an
ordinary
homburg
hat
and
filled
a
small
leather
case
with
various
papers
he
was
on
the
point
of
leaving
the
room
when
his
eyes
fell
upon
the
cable
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
gazed
at
the
superscription
shrugged
his
shoulders
and
tore
it
open
he
moved
to
the
window
and
read
it
slowly
word

seen

very
worried
potts
word
by
word
philip
read
the
cable
twice
over
then
it
fluttered
from
his
fingers
on
to
the
table
it
told
its
own
story
beyond
any
shadow
of
a
mistake
his
cousin
great
wealth
was
a
fiction
the
business
to
which
his
own
fortune
and
the
whole
of
his
grandfather
money
had
been
devoted
was
even
now
tottering
he
remembered
the
rumours
he
had
heard
of
douglas
extravagance
his
establishment
in
london
the
burden
of
his
college
debts
and
then
a
further
light
flashed
in
upon
him
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
america
lying
there
too
for
douglas
under
a
false
name
he
drew
out
one
of
the
documents
which
he
had
packed
and
glanced
at
it
more
carefully
then
he
replaced
it
a
little
dazed
douglas
had
planned
to
leave
england
then
with
this
crisis
looming
over
him
why
philip
for
a
moment
sat
down
on
the
arm
of
an
a
grim
sense
of
humour
suddenly
parted
his
lips
he
threw
back
his
head
and
laughed
douglas
romilly
had
actually
been
coming
to
america
to
disappear
it
was
incredible
but
it
was
true
he
left
the
cable
carefully
open
upon
the
and
picking
up
the
small
leather
case
left
the
room
he
reached
the
lift
happily
escaping
the
observation
of
the
young
lady
seated
at
her
desk
and
descended
into
the
hall
once
amongst
the
crowd
of
people
who
thronged
the
corridors
he
found
it
perfectly
simple
to
leave
the
hotel
by
one
of
the
side
entrances
he
walked
to
the
corner
of
the
street
and
drew
a
little
breath
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
strolled
along
broadway
curiously
his
spirits
rising
at
every
step
he
was
free
for
ever
from
that
other
hateful
personality
douglas
romilly
of
the
douglas
romilly
shoe
company
had
paid
his
brief
visit
to
america
and
passed
on
book
ii
chapter
i
after
a
fortnight
of
his
new
life
philip
took
stock
of
himself
and
his
belongings
in
the
first
place
then
he
owned
a
new
name
taken
bodily
from
certain
documents
which
he
had
brought
with
him
from
england
further
as
merton
ware
he
was
the
monthly
tenant
of
a
small
but
not
uncomfortable
suite
of
rooms
on
the
top
story
of
a
residential
hotel
in
the
purlieus
of
broadway
he
had
also
apparently
been
a
collector
of
newspapers
of
certain
dates
all
of
which
contained
some
such
paragraph
as
this
douglas
romilly
wealthy
english
boot
manufacturer
disappears
from
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
walks
out
of
his
room
within
an
hour
of
landing
and
has
not
been
heard
of
since
down
town
haunts
searched
foul
play
feared
superintendent
shipman
declares
himself
baffled
early
on
monday
morning
the
police
of
the
city
were
invited
to
investigate
a
case
of
curious
disappearance
douglas
romilly
an
english
shoe
manufacturer
who
travelled
out
from
england
on
board
the
arrived
at
the
waldorf
hotel
at
four
on
saturday
afternoon
and
was
shown
to
the
reservation
made
for
him
within
an
hour
he
was
enquired
for
by
several
callers
who
were
shown
to
his
room
without
result
the
apartment
was
found
to
be
empty
and
nothing
has
since
been
seen
or
heard
of
romilly
the
room
assigned
to
him
which
could
only
have
been
occupied
for
a
few
minutes
has
been
locked
up
and
the
keys
handed
to
the
police
a
considerable
amount
of
luggage
is
in
their
possession
and
certain
documents
of
a
somewhat
curious
character
from
cables
received
early
this
afternoon
it
would
appear
that
the
douglas
romilly
shoe
company
one
of
the
oldest
established
firms
in
england
is
in
financial
difficulties
then
there
was
a
paragraph
in
a
paper
of
later
date
no
news
of
douglas
romilly
the
police
have
been
unable
to
discover
any
trace
of
the
missing
englishman
from
further
cables
to
hand
it
appears
that
he
was
in
possession
of
a
considerable
sum
of
money
which
must
have
been
on
his
person
at
the
time
of
disappearance
and
it
is
alleged
that
there
was
also
a
large
amount
with
which
he
had
intended
to
make
purchases
for
his
business
standing
to
his
credit
at
a
new
york
bank
nothing
has
since
been
discovered
however
amongst
his
belongings
of
the
slightest
financial
value
nor
does
any
bank
in
new
york
admit
holding
a
credit
on
behalf
of
the
missing
man
perhaps
it
is
time
philip
murmured
that
these
were
destroyed
he
tore
the
newspapers
into
pieces
and
threw
them
into
his
on
his
were
forty
or
fifty
closely
written
pages
of
manuscript
in
his
pocketbook
were
sixteen
hundred
dollars
and
a
document
indicating
a
credit
for
a
very
much
larger
amount
at
the
united
bank
of
new
york
in
favor
of
merton
ware
and
another
the
remainder
of
his
belongings
were
negligible
he
stood
at
the
window
and
looked
out
across
the
city
the
city
into
whose
labyrinths
he
was
so
eager
to
penetrate
the
undiscovered
country
by
day
and
night
its
voices
were
in
his
ears
the
rattle
and
roar
of
the
overhead
railway
the
clanging
of
the
street
cars
the
heavy
traffic
the
fainter
but
never
ceasing
of
the
multitudes
he
had
sat
there
before
dawn
and
watched
the
queer
light
steal
with
ever
widening
fingers
through
the
darkness
heard
the
yawn
of
the
city
as
it
seemed
to
shiver
and
tremble
before
the
battle
of
the
day
at
twilight
he
had
watched
the
lights
spring
up
one
by
one
at
first
like
pin
pricks
in
the
distance
growing
and
widening
until
the
grotesque
shapes
of
the
buildings
from
which
they
sprung
had
faded
into
nothingness
and
there
was
left
only
a
velvet
curtain
of
stars
at
a
giddy
distance
below
he
could
trace
the
blaze
of
broadway
the
blue
lights
flashing
from
the
electric
wires
as
the
cable
cars
rushed
back
and
forth
the
red
and
violet
glimmer
of
the
sky
signs
he
knew
it
all
so
well
by
morning
by
noon
and
night
in
rainstorm
storms
which
he
had
watched
come
up
from
oceanwards
in
drifting
clouds
of
vapour
and
in
sunshine
clear
brilliant
sunshine
a
little
hard
and
austere
to
his
way
of
thinking
and
unseasonable
a
week
he
muttered
she
said
a
week
tonight
i
will
go
out
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
glass
he
wore
no
longer
the
clothes
of
douglas
romilly
saville
row
tailor
but
a
suit
of
schmitt
mayer
business
an
american
felt
hat
and
shoes
she
said
a
week
he
repeated
it
a
fortnight
i
go
to
the
restaurant
at
the
corner
i
must
find
out
for
myself
what
all
this
noise
means
what
the
city
has
to
say
he
turned
towards
the
door
and
then
stopped
short
for
almost
the
first
time
since
he
had
taken
up
his
quarters
here
the
lift
had
stopped
outside
there
was
a
brief
pause
then
his
bell
rang
for
a
moment
philip
hesitated
then
he
stepped
forward
and
opened
the
door
looking
out
enquiringly
at
his
caller
you
merton
ware
he
admitted
the
fact
briefly
his
visitor
was
a
young
woman
dressed
in
a
rather
shabby
black
indoor
dress
over
which
she
wore
an
apron
she
was
without
either
hat
or
gloves
her
fingers
were
stained
with
purple
copying
ink
and
her
dark
hair
was
untidily
arranged
i
live
two
stories
down
below
she
announced
handing
him
a
little
card
miss
martha
grimes
that
my
name
typewriter
and
stenographer
you
see
the
waiter
who
brings
our
meals
told
me
he
thought
you
were
some
way
literary
so
i
just
stepped
up
to
show
you
my
prospectus
if
any
typewriting
you
want
doing
i
on
the
spot
and
i
do
know
as
you
get
it
done
much
cheaper
anywhere
else
or
better
there
was
nothing
particularly
ingratiating
about
miss
martha
grimes
but
with
the
exception
of
a
coloured
waiter
she
happened
to
be
the
first
human
being
with
whom
philip
had
exchanged
a
word
for
several
days
he
felt
disinclined
to
hurry
her
away
come
in
he
invited
holding
the
door
open
so
you
do
typing
eh
what
sort
of
a
machine
do
you
use
remington
she
answered
it
a
bit
knocked
about
a
few
of
the
letters
i
mean
but
i
got
some
violet
ink
and
i
can
make
a
manuscript
look
all
right
half
a
dollar
a
thousand
words
and
a
quarter
for
carbon
copies
of
course
if
you
got
a
lot
of
stuff
she
went
on
her
eyes
lighting
hopefully
upon
the
little
collection
of
manuscript
upon
his
table
i
might
quote
you
a
trifle
less
he
picked
up
some
of
his
sheets
and
glanced
at
them
sooner
or
later
he
admitted
i
shall
have
to
have
this
typed
it
is
quite
ready
yet
though
he
was
struck
by
the
curious
little
light
of
anticipation
which
somehow
changed
her
face
and
which
passed
away
at
his
last
words
under
pretence
of
gathering
together
some
of
those
loose
pages
he
examined
her
more
closely
and
realised
that
he
had
done
her
at
first
scant
justice
she
was
very
thin
and
the
expression
of
her
face
was
spoilt
by
the
discontented
curve
of
her
lips
the
shape
of
her
head
however
was
good
her
dark
hair
notwithstanding
its
temporary
disarrangement
was
of
beautiful
quality
and
her
eyes
though
dull
and
were
large
and
full
of
subtle
promise
he
replaced
the
sheets
of
manuscript
sit
down
for
a
moment
he
begged
i
rather
stand
she
replied
just
as
you
please
he
assented
smiling
i
was
just
wondering
what
to
do
about
this
stuff
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
a
little
sulkily
she
seated
herself
i
suppose
you
think
i
a
pretty
forward
young
person
to
come
up
here
and
beg
for
work
i
do
care
if
you
do
she
went
on
swinging
her
foot
back
and
forth
one
has
to
live
i
am
very
pleased
that
you
came
he
assured
her
it
will
be
a
great
convenience
to
me
to
have
my
typing
done
on
the
premises
and
although
i
am
afraid
there
wo
be
much
of
it
you
shall
certainly
do
what
there
is
story
writer
she
enquired
i
am
only
a
beginner
he
told
her
this
work
i
am
going
to
give
you
is
a
play
she
looked
at
him
with
a
shade
of
commiseration
in
her
face
sickening
job
ai
it
writing
for
the
stage
unless
you
got
some
sort
of
pull
this
is
my
first
effort
he
explained
well
it
none
of
my
business
she
said
gloomily
all
i
want
is
the
typing
of
it
only
you
should
see
some
of
the
truck
i
had
i
hated
to
send
in
the
bill
waste
of
good
time
and
paper
i
do
suppose
yours
is
like
that
but
there
ai
much
written
that
any
good
anyway
you
a
hopeful
young
person
are
you
he
remarked
taking
a
cigarette
from
the
mantelpiece
and
lighting
it
have
one
no
thank
she
replied
rising
briskly
to
her
feet
i
not
that
sort
that
sits
about
and
smokes
cigarettes
with
strange
young
men
if
you
let
me
know
when
that
work
going
to
be
ready
i
send
the
janitor
up
for
it
he
smiled
deprecatingly
you
not
afraid
of
me
by
any
chance
are
you
he
asked
her
eyes
glowed
with
contempt
as
she
looked
him
up
and
down
afraid
of
you
sir
she
repeated
i
should
say
not
i
met
all
sorts
of
men
and
i
know
something
about
them
then
sit
down
again
please
he
begged
she
hesitated
for
a
moment
then
subsided
once
more
unwillingly
into
the
chair
do
know
as
i
want
to
stay
up
here
gossiping
she
remarked
much
better
be
getting
on
with
your
work
give
me
one
of
those
cigarettes
anyway
she
added
abruptly
do
you
live
in
the
building
he
enquired
as
he
obeyed
her
behest
two
flats
below
with
pop
she
replied
he
a
bad
actor
very
seldom
in
work
and
he
drinks
there
are
just
the
two
of
us
now
you
know
as
much
as
is
good
for
you
you
english
ai
you
i
am
philip
admitted
just
out
too
by
the
way
you
talk
i
have
been
living
in
jamaica
he
told
her
for
many
years
clerk
in
an
office
there
better
have
stayed
where
you
were
i
should
think
if
you
come
here
hoping
to
make
a
living
by
that
sort
of
stuff
perhaps
you
right
he
agreed
but
you
see
i
am
here
been
here
a
week
or
two
in
fact
done
much
visiting
around
she
enquired
i
scarcely
been
out
he
confessed
you
see
i
do
know
the
city
except
from
my
windows
it
wonderful
from
here
after
twilight
think
so
she
replied
dully
it
a
hard
hammering
brazen
sort
of
place
when
you
living
in
it
from
hand
to
mouth
not
but
what
we
get
along
all
right
she
added
a
little
defiantly
i
not
grumbling
i
am
sure
you
not
he
assented
soothingly
tell
me
i
am
a
little
tired
of
work
i
thought
of
going
out
be
a
good
samaritan
and
tell
me
where
to
find
a
restaurant
in
broadway
somewhere
where
crowds
of
people
go
but
not
what
they
call
a
fashionable
place
i
want
to
get
some
dinner
i
have
had
anything
decent
to
eat
for
i
do
know
how
long
and
i
want
to
breathe
the
same
atmosphere
as
other
people
she
looked
at
him
a
little
enviously
how
much
do
you
want
to
spend
she
asked
bluntly
i
do
know
that
that
really
matters
very
much
i
have
some
money
things
are
more
expensive
over
here
are
they
i
should
go
to
the
new
martin
house
she
advised
him
right
at
the
corner
of
this
block
it
real
swell
and
they
say
the
wonderful
i
could
go
as
i
am
i
suppose
he
asked
glancing
down
at
his
clothes
she
stared
at
him
wonderingly
say
where
did
you
come
from
she
exclaimed
you
ai
supposed
to
dress
yourself
out
in
glad
clothes
for
a
broadway
restaurant
not
even
the
best
of
them
have
you
been
to
this
place
yourself
he
enquired
nope
come
with
me
he
invited
suddenly
she
arose
at
once
to
her
feet
and
threw
the
remains
of
her
cigarette
into
the
grate
say
ware
she
pronounced
i
ai
that
sort
and
the
sooner
you
know
it
the
better
especially
if
i
going
to
do
your
work
i
be
going
look
here
he
remonstrated
earnestly
you
do
seem
to
understand
me
altogether
what
do
you
mean
by
saying
you
not
that
sort
you
know
well
enough
she
answered
defiantly
i
guess
you
not
proposing
to
give
me
a
supper
out
of
charity
are
you
i
am
asking
you
to
accompany
me
he
declared
because
i
have
spoken
to
a
human
being
for
a
week
because
i
do
know
a
soul
in
new
york
because
i
got
enough
money
to
pay
for
two
dinners
and
because
i
am
fiendishly
lonely
she
looked
at
him
and
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
more
than
half
convinced
her
brightening
expression
transformed
her
face
she
was
still
hesitating
but
her
inclinations
were
apparent
say
you
mean
that
straight
she
asked
you
wo
turn
around
afterwards
and
expect
a
lot
of
soft
sawder
because
you
bought
me
a
meal
do
be
a
silly
little
fool
he
answered
all
i
want
from
you
is
to
sit
by
my
side
and
talk
and
tell
me
what
to
order
her
face
suddenly
fell
no
good
she
sighed
have
got
any
clothes
if
i
am
going
like
this
he
expostulated
why
ca
you
go
as
you
are
take
your
apron
off
you
be
all
right
there
my
black
hat
with
the
ribbon
she
reminded
herself
it
no
style
and
stella
said
yesterday
she
would
be
seen
in
a
dime
show
in
it
never
you
mind
about
stella
he
insisted
confidently
you
clap
it
on
your
head
and
come
along
she
swung
towards
the
door
meet
you
in
the
hall
in
ten
minutes
she
promised
ca
be
any
quicker
this
is
your
trouble
you
know
i
did
invite
myself
philip
opened
the
door
a
civility
which
seemed
to
somewhat
embarrass
her
i
shall
be
waiting
for
you
he
declared
cheerfully
chapter
ii
philip
stepped
into
his
own
little
bedroom
and
made
scanty
preparations
for
this
his
first
excursion
then
he
made
his
way
down
into
the
shabby
hall
and
was
seated
there
on
the
worn
settee
when
his
guest
descended
she
was
wearing
a
hat
which
so
far
as
he
could
judge
was
almost
becoming
her
gloves
notwithstanding
their
many
signs
of
mending
were
neat
her
shoes
carefully
polished
and
although
her
dress
was
undeniably
shabby
there
was
something
in
her
carriage
which
pleased
him
her
eyes
were
fixed
upon
his
from
the
moment
she
stepped
from
the
lift
she
was
watching
for
his
expression
half
defiantly
half
anxiously
well
you
see
what
i
look
like
she
remarked
brusquely
you
can
back
out
of
it
if
you
want
to
do
be
silly
he
replied
you
look
quite
all
right
i
not
much
of
a
beau
myself
you
know
i
bought
this
suit
over
the
counter
the
other
day
without
being
measured
for
it
or
anything
guess
you
ai
used
to
clothes
she
observed
as
they
stepped
outside
you
see
in
england
and
the
colonies
he
added
hastily
things
so
expensive
as
here
what
a
wonderful
city
this
is
of
yours
martha
miss
grimes
please
she
corrected
him
i
beg
your
pardon
he
apologised
that
just
what
i
was
afraid
of
she
went
on
querulously
beginning
already
you
think
because
you
giving
me
a
meal
you
can
take
all
sorts
of
liberties
calling
me
by
my
christian
name
indeed
it
was
entirely
a
slip
he
assured
her
tell
me
what
theatre
that
is
across
the
way
she
answered
his
question
and
volunteered
other
pieces
of
information
philip
gazed
about
him
as
they
walked
along
broadway
with
the
eager
curiosity
of
a
provincial
sightseer
she
laughed
at
him
a
little
scornfully
you
get
used
to
all
the
life
and
bustle
presently
she
told
him
it
wo
seem
so
wonderful
to
you
when
you
walk
along
here
without
a
dollar
to
bless
yourself
with
and
your
silly
plays
come
tumbling
back
now
this
is
the
martin
house
my
looks
good
inside
do
it
they
crossed
the
threshold
philip
handed
his
hat
to
the
attendant
and
they
stood
a
little
undecided
at
the
top
of
the
room
a
condescending
maître
showed
them
to
a
retired
table
in
a
distant
corner
and
another
waiter
handed
them
a
menu
you
know
half
of
this
is
unintelligible
to
me
philip
confessed
you
have
to
do
the
ordering
that
was
our
bargain
you
know
you
must
tell
me
how
much
you
want
to
spend
then
she
insisted
i
will
not
he
answered
firmly
what
i
want
is
a
good
dinner
and
for
this
once
in
my
life
i
do
care
what
it
costs
i
a
few
hundred
dollars
in
my
pocket
so
you
need
be
afraid
i
sha
be
able
to
pay
the
bill
you
just
order
the
things
you
like
and
a
bottle
of
claret
or
anything
else
you
prefer
she
turned
to
the
waiter
and
carefully
studying
the
prices
she
gave
him
an
order
one
portion
for
two
remember
of
the
fish
and
the
salad
she
enjoined
two
portions
of
the
chicken
if
you
think
one
wo
be
enough
she
leaned
back
in
her
place
it
going
to
cost
you
when
you
paid
for
the
claret
a
matter
of
four
dollars
and
fifty
cents
this
dinner
she
said
and
i
guess
have
to
give
the
waiter
a
quarter
are
you
scared
he
laughed
at
her
once
more
not
a
bit
she
looked
at
his
long
delicate
fingers
studied
him
for
a
moment
notwithstanding
his
clothes
there
was
an
air
of
breeding
about
him
unconcealable
a
thing
apart
even
from
his
good
looks
clerk
were
you
she
remarked
seems
to
me
you
used
to
spending
two
dollars
on
a
meal
all
right
i
not
neither
am
i
he
assured
her
one
does
have
much
opportunity
of
spending
money
in
jamaica
you
seem
kind
of
used
to
it
somehow
she
persisted
have
you
come
into
money
then
i
saved
a
little
he
explained
with
a
rather
grim
smile
and
i
well
shall
we
say
come
into
some
stolen
it
maybe
she
observed
indifferently
should
you
be
horrified
if
i
told
that
i
had
i
do
know
she
answered
i
one
of
those
who
lived
honest
and
i
sometimes
wonder
whether
it
pays
it
a
great
problem
he
sighed
it
is
that
she
admitted
gloomily
i
got
a
friend
she
used
to
live
in
our
place
just
below
me
stella
kimbell
her
name
is
she
and
i
learnt
our
typewriting
together
and
started
in
the
same
office
we
stood
it
somehow
for
three
years
sometimes
office
work
sometimes
at
home
we
did
have
much
luck
it
was
always
better
for
me
than
for
stella
because
she
was
and
i
not
i
should
say
that
he
remonstrated
you
got
beautiful
eyes
you
know
you
stop
it
she
warned
him
firmly
my
eyes
are
my
own
and
trouble
you
not
to
make
remarks
about
them
sorry
philip
murmured
duly
crushed
the
men
were
after
her
all
the
time
the
girl
continued
reminiscently
last
place
we
were
at
a
dry
goods
store
not
far
from
here
the
heads
of
the
departments
used
to
make
her
life
fairly
miserable
she
held
out
though
but
what
with
fines
and
one
thing
or
another
they
forced
her
to
leave
so
i
did
the
same
we
drifted
apart
then
for
a
while
she
got
a
job
at
an
automobile
place
and
i
was
working
at
home
i
remember
the
night
she
came
to
me
i
was
all
alone
pop
had
got
a
part
somewhere
and
was
bragging
about
it
at
all
the
bars
in
broadway
stella
came
in
quite
suddenly
and
almost
out
of
breath
she
said
through
with
it
do
you
mean
i
asked
her
then
she
threw
herself
down
on
the
sofa
and
she
sobbed
i
never
heard
a
girl
cry
like
that
in
all
my
life
she
shrieked
she
was
pretty
nearly
in
hysterics
and
i
could
get
a
word
out
of
her
when
she
was
through
at
last
she
was
all
limp
and
white
she
would
tell
me
anything
she
simply
sat
and
looked
at
the
stove
presently
she
got
up
to
go
i
put
my
hands
on
her
shoulders
and
i
forced
her
back
in
the
chair
got
to
tell
me
all
about
it
stella
i
insisted
and
then
of
course
i
heard
the
whole
story
she
got
fired
again
these
men
are
devils
do
tell
me
more
about
it
unless
you
like
he
begged
sympathetically
where
is
she
now
in
the
chorus
of
frivolous
maids
she
comes
in
here
regularly
sorry
for
herself
not
she
last
time
i
saw
her
she
told
me
she
would
go
back
into
an
office
or
take
on
typewriting
again
for
anything
in
the
world
she
was
looking
prettier
than
ever
too
there
a
swell
chap
almost
crazy
about
her
should
wonder
if
she
has
got
an
automobile
well
she
answers
our
question
one
way
then
he
remarked
thoughtfully
tell
me
miss
grimes
is
everything
to
eat
in
america
as
good
as
this
fish
some
cooking
here
she
observed
looking
rather
regretfully
at
her
empty
plate
i
told
you
things
were
all
right
there
grilled
chicken
maryland
chicken
coming
and
green
corn
have
i
got
to
eat
the
corn
like
that
man
opposite
he
asked
anxiously
you
can
eat
it
how
you
like
she
answered
watch
me
if
you
want
to
i
do
care
i
ai
tasted
green
corn
since
i
can
remember
and
i
going
to
enjoy
it
you
do
like
your
claret
i
afraid
he
remarked
she
sipped
it
and
set
down
the
glass
a
little
disparagingly
if
you
want
to
know
what
i
would
like
she
said
it
just
a
martini
cocktail
we
do
drink
wines
over
here
as
much
as
you
folk
i
guess
he
ordered
the
cocktails
at
once
every
now
and
then
he
watched
her
she
ate
delicately
but
with
a
healthy
and
unashamed
appetite
a
little
colour
came
into
her
cheeks
as
the
room
grew
warmer
her
lower
lip
became
less
uncompromising
suddenly
she
laid
down
her
knife
and
fork
her
eyes
were
agleam
with
interest
she
pulled
at
his
sleeve
say
that
stella
she
exclaimed
excitedly
look
she
coming
this
way
do
she
look
stunning
a
girl
undeniably
pretty
with
dark
hair
wearing
a
long
ermine
coat
and
followed
by
a
fashionably
dressed
young
man
was
making
her
way
up
the
room
she
suddenly
recognised
philip
companion
and
came
towards
her
with
outstretched
hand
if
it
is
martha
she
cried
is
this
great
felix
this
is
miss
grimes
martha
grimes
you
know
she
added
calling
to
the
young
man
who
was
accompanying
her
you
must
remember
why
what
the
matter
with
you
felix
she
broke
off
in
her
speech
her
companion
was
staring
at
philip
who
was
returning
his
scrutiny
with
an
air
of
mild
interrogation
say
the
young
man
enquired
did
i
meet
you
on
the
are
you
douglas
romilly
philip
shook
his
head
my
name
is
ware
he
pronounced
merton
ware
i
have
certainly
never
been
on
the
and
i
do
remember
having
met
you
before
the
young
man
whose
name
was
felix
appeared
almost
stupefied
gee
whiz
he
muttered
excuse
me
sir
but
i
never
saw
such
a
likeness
before
never
well
shake
hands
with
miss
grimes
quickly
and
come
along
stella
enjoined
remember
i
only
have
half
an
hour
for
dinner
now
you
coming
to
see
the
show
martha
not
that
young
woman
declared
firmly
the
two
passed
on
after
a
few
more
moments
of
amiable
but
on
the
part
of
the
young
man
somewhat
dazed
conversation
philip
had
resumed
the
consumption
of
his
chicken
he
raised
an
glass
to
his
lips
steadily
and
drank
it
without
spilling
a
drop
mistook
me
for
some
one
he
remarked
coolly
she
nodded
man
who
disappeared
from
the
waldorf
astoria
they
made
quite
a
fuss
about
him
in
the
newspapers
i
should
have
said
you
were
the
least
like
him
to
judge
by
his
pictures
anyway
philip
shrugged
his
shoulders
he
seemed
very
little
interested
i
do
often
read
the
newspapers
so
that
is
stella
that
is
stella
she
assented
a
little
defiantly
and
if
i
were
she
i
mean
if
i
were
as
as
she
is
i
be
in
her
place
i
wonder
whether
you
would
he
observed
thoughtfully
oh
do
bother
me
with
your
problems
she
replied
does
it
run
to
coffee
of
course
it
does
he
agreed
and
a
liqueur
if
you
like
if
you
mean
a
cordial
i
have
some
of
that
green
stuff
she
decided
do
know
when
i
shall
get
another
dinner
like
this
again
well
that
rests
with
you
he
assured
her
i
am
very
lonely
just
now
later
on
it
will
be
different
we
come
again
next
week
if
you
like
better
see
how
you
feel
about
it
when
the
time
comes
she
answered
practically
besides
i
not
sure
they
let
me
in
here
again
did
you
see
stella
coat
fancy
feeling
fur
like
that
up
against
your
chin
fancy
she
broke
off
and
sipped
her
coffee
broodingly
those
things
are
immaterial
in
themselves
he
reminded
her
it
just
a
question
how
much
happiness
they
have
brought
her
whether
the
thing
pays
or
not
of
course
it
pays
she
declared
almost
passionately
you
never
seen
my
rooms
or
my
drunken
father
i
can
tell
you
what
they
like
though
they
ugly
they
tawdry
they
untidy
when
i
any
work
to
do
they
scarcely
clean
our
meals
are
thrown
at
us
we
always
behind
with
the
rent
there
is
anything
to
look
at
or
listen
to
that
is
ugly
you
have
known
what
it
is
to
feel
the
grim
pang
of
a
constant
hideousness
crawling
into
your
senses
stupefying
you
almost
with
a
sort
of
misery
oh
i
ca
describe
it
i
have
felt
all
those
things
he
said
quietly
what
did
you
do
she
demanded
no
perhaps
you
had
luck
perhaps
not
fair
to
ask
you
that
it
would
apply
what
should
you
do
if
you
were
me
if
you
had
the
chance
to
get
out
of
it
all
the
way
that
she
has
i
am
not
a
woman
he
reminded
her
simply
if
i
answer
you
as
an
outsider
a
mind
though
one
who
thinks
about
men
and
women
i
should
say
try
one
of
her
lesser
sins
one
of
the
sins
that
leaves
you
clean
steal
for
instance
and
go
to
prison
she
protested
angrily
how
much
better
off
would
you
be
there
i
wonder
and
what
about
when
you
came
out
pooh
pay
your
bill
and
let
get
out
of
this
he
obeyed
and
they
made
their
way
into
the
crowded
street
he
paused
for
a
moment
on
the
pavement
the
pleasure
swirl
was
creeping
a
little
into
his
veins
would
you
like
to
go
to
a
theatre
he
asked
she
shook
her
head
you
do
as
you
like
i
going
home
you
need
bother
about
coming
with
me
either
do
be
foolish
he
protested
i
only
mentioned
a
theatre
for
your
sake
come
along
they
walked
down
broadway
and
turned
into
their
own
street
they
entered
the
tenement
building
together
and
stepped
into
the
lift
she
held
out
her
hand
a
little
abruptly
good
night
good
night
he
answered
you
get
out
first
do
you
i
polish
that
stuff
up
the
first
part
of
it
so
that
you
can
get
on
with
the
typing
some
fear
which
had
been
troubling
her
during
the
walk
home
seemed
to
have
passed
her
face
cleared
do
think
i
am
ungrateful
she
begged
as
the
lift
stopped
i
have
had
a
good
time
like
this
for
many
months
thank
you
ware
and
good
night
she
stepped
through
the
iron
gates
on
to
her
own
floor
and
philip
swung
up
to
his
rooms
somehow
he
entered
almost
the
roar
of
the
city
below
was
no
longer
provocative
he
felt
as
though
he
had
stretched
out
a
hand
towards
it
as
though
he
were
in
the
way
of
becoming
one
of
its
children
chapter
iii
a
few
nights
later
philip
awoke
suddenly
to
find
himself
in
a
cold
sweat
face
to
face
with
all
the
horrors
of
an
excited
imagination
once
more
he
felt
his
hand
greedy
for
the
soft
flesh
of
the
man
he
hated
tearing
its
way
through
the
stiff
collar
felt
the
demoniacal
strength
shooting
down
his
arm
the
fever
at
his
finger
tips
he
saw
the
terrified
face
of
his
victim
a
strong
man
but
impotent
in
his
grasp
heard
the
splash
of
the
turgid
waters
saw
himself
his
lust
for
vengeance
unsatisfied
peering
downwards
through
the
dim
and
murky
gloom
it
was
not
only
a
physical
nightmare
which
seized
him
his
brain
too
was
his
accuser
he
saw
with
a
hideous
clarity
that
even
the
excuse
of
motive
was
denied
him
it
was
a
sense
of
personal
loss
which
had
driven
him
out
on
to
that
canal
path
a
murderer
at
heart
it
was
something
of
which
he
had
been
robbed
an
acute
and
burning
desire
for
vengeance
personal
entirely
egotistical
it
was
not
the
wrong
to
the
woman
which
he
resented
had
there
been
any
wrong
it
was
the
agony
of
his
own
personal
misery
he
rose
from
his
bed
and
stamped
up
and
down
his
little
chamber
in
a
fear
which
was
almost
hysterical
he
threw
wide
open
the
windows
heedless
of
a
driving
snowstorm
the
subdued
murmur
of
the
city
with
its
paling
lights
brought
him
no
relief
he
longed
frantically
for
some
one
who
knew
the
truth
for
elizabeth
before
any
one
with
her
soft
cool
touch
her
gentle
protective
sympathy
he
was
a
fool
to
think
he
could
live
alone
like
this
with
such
a
burden
to
bear
perhaps
it
would
not
be
for
long
the
risks
were
many
at
any
moment
he
might
hear
the
lift
stop
steps
across
the
corridor
the
ring
at
his
bell
the
businesslike
man
outside
with
his
formal
questions
his
grim
civility
he
fumbled
about
in
his
little
until
he
came
to
a
small
box
containing
several
white
pills
he
gripped
them
in
his
hand
and
looked
around
listening
no
it
was
fancy
there
was
still
no
sound
in
the
building
when
at
last
he
went
back
to
bed
however
the
little
box
was
tightly
clenched
in
his
hands
in
the
morning
he
went
through
his
usual
programme
he
arose
soon
after
eight
lighted
his
little
spirit
lamp
made
his
coffee
cut
some
bread
and
butter
and
breakfasted
then
he
lit
a
cigarette
and
sat
down
at
his
desk
his
imagination
however
seemed
to
have
burnt
itself
out
in
the
night
ideas
and
phrases
were
denied
to
him
he
was
thankful
about
eleven
to
hear
a
ring
at
the
bell
and
find
martha
grimes
outside
with
a
little
parcel
under
her
arm
she
was
wearing
the
same
shabby
black
dress
and
her
fingers
were
stained
with
copying
ink
her
almost
too
luxuriant
hair
was
and
untidy
even
her
eyes
seemed
to
have
lost
their
lustre
i
finished
she
announced
handing
him
the
parcel
better
look
and
see
whether
it
all
right
i
ca
do
it
up
properly
till
i
had
the
whole
he
cut
the
string
and
looked
at
a
few
of
the
sheets
the
typing
was
perfect
he
began
to
express
his
approval
but
she
interrupted
him
it
better
stuff
than
i
expected
she
declared
grudgingly
i
thought
you
were
only
one
of
these
miserable
amateurs
where
did
you
learn
to
write
like
that
somehow
her
praise
was
like
a
tonic
do
you
like
it
he
asked
eagerly
oh
my
likes
or
dislikes
do
matter
she
replied
it
good
stuff
you
find
the
account
in
there
if
you
like
to
pay
me
i
like
to
have
the
money
he
glanced
at
the
neat
little
bill
and
took
out
his
pocketbook
sit
down
for
a
minute
he
begged
i
stuck
this
morning
ca
write
a
line
take
my
and
smoke
a
cigarette
i
have
nothing
else
to
offer
you
for
a
moment
she
seemed
about
to
refuse
then
she
flung
herself
into
his
took
a
cigarette
and
holding
it
between
her
lips
almost
scarlet
against
the
pallor
of
her
cheeks
stretched
upwards
towards
the
match
which
he
was
holding
stella
and
her
boy
were
over
to
see
me
last
night
she
announced
a
little
abruptly
the
young
lady
with
the
ermines
he
murmured
and
her
boy
felix
martin
it
was
through
him
they
came
i
could
see
that
all
right
he
was
trying
all
the
time
to
pump
me
about
you
about
me
oh
you
need
trouble
to
look
surprised
she
remarked
i
guess
you
remember
the
bee
he
had
in
his
bonnet
that
night
mistook
me
for
some
one
did
he
philip
murmured
she
nodded
kind
of
queer
you
do
read
our
newspapers
it
was
a
guy
named
romilly
douglas
romilly
who
disappeared
from
the
waldorf
hotel
strange
thing
about
it
she
went
on
is
that
i
saw
photographs
of
him
in
the
newspapers
and
i
ca
recognise
even
a
likeness
this
felix
martin
does
agree
with
you
apparently
philip
observed
he
do
go
by
the
photographs
martha
grimes
explained
he
believes
that
he
crossed
from
liverpool
with
this
douglas
romilly
and
that
you
she
continued
crossing
her
legs
and
smoothing
down
her
skirt
to
hide
her
shabby
shoes
are
so
much
like
him
that
he
came
down
last
night
to
see
if
there
was
anything
else
he
could
find
out
from
me
before
he
paid
a
visit
to
police
headquarters
there
was
a
moment
silence
philip
was
apparently
groping
for
a
match
and
the
girl
was
keeping
her
head
studiously
turned
away
from
him
what
business
is
it
of
his
there
was
a
reward
offered
do
know
as
that
would
make
much
difference
to
felix
martin
though
according
to
stella
account
he
is
pretty
well
a
millionaire
already
it
would
be
more
useful
to
you
would
it
philip
remarked
five
hundred
dollars
martha
sighed
do
seem
to
me
just
now
that
there
much
in
the
world
you
could
buy
with
five
hundred
dollars
well
what
did
you
tell
felix
martin
oh
i
lied
sure
he
found
out
the
date
you
came
into
your
rooms
here
the
day
this
man
romilly
disappeared
but
i
told
him
that
i
known
you
and
done
work
for
you
before
then
long
enough
before
the
ever
reached
new
york
that
kind
of
stumped
him
why
did
you
do
that
philip
demanded
dunno
the
girl
replied
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
just
a
fancy
i
guessed
you
would
want
him
poking
around
but
supposing
i
had
been
douglas
romilly
you
might
at
least
have
divided
the
reward
he
reminded
her
there
money
and
money
martha
declared
we
spoke
of
that
the
other
day
stella
got
money
now
well
she
welcome
my
time
will
come
i
suppose
but
if
i
ca
have
clean
money
i
have
made
up
my
mind
yet
whether
i
would
rather
try
the
hudson
on
a
foggy
morning
well
i
am
not
douglas
romilly
anyway
philip
announced
she
looked
up
at
him
almost
for
the
first
time
since
her
entrance
i
kind
of
thought
you
were
she
admitted
i
might
have
saved
my
lies
then
he
shook
his
head
you
have
probably
saved
me
from
more
than
you
know
of
he
replied
i
am
not
douglas
romilly
but
you
not
merton
ware
either
she
interrupted
quite
right
he
agreed
i
started
life
as
philip
merton
ware
the
day
i
took
these
rooms
and
if
the
time
should
come
he
went
on
that
any
one
seriously
set
about
the
task
of
finding
out
exactly
who
i
was
before
i
was
merton
ware
you
and
i
might
as
well
take
that
little
journey
was
it
to
the
hudson
you
said
on
a
foggy
morning
together
they
sat
in
complete
silence
for
several
moments
then
she
threw
the
end
of
her
cigarette
into
the
fire
well
i
glad
i
did
lie
for
nothing
she
declared
i
did
quite
tumble
to
the
douglas
romilly
stunt
though
they
say
he
has
left
his
business
bankrupt
in
england
and
brought
a
fortune
out
here
you
look
as
though
you
were
overdone
with
it
i
certainly
have
the
fortune
that
douglas
romilly
is
supposed
to
have
got
away
with
he
said
quietly
i
have
enough
money
for
my
present
needs
though
enough
to
pay
you
for
this
typing
he
added
counting
out
the
money
upon
the
table
any
more
stuff
ready
with
luck
there
be
some
this
afternoon
he
promised
her
i
had
a
bad
night
last
night
but
i
think
i
be
able
to
work
later
in
the
day
she
looked
at
him
curiously
at
his
face
absolutely
devoid
of
colour
his
eyes
restless
and
overbright
his
long
twitching
fingers
bad
conscience
or
drugs
she
asked
bad
conscience
he
acknowledged
i
been
where
you
have
been
miss
grimes
i
looked
over
the
edge
and
i
jumped
i
stay
where
you
are
if
i
were
you
maybe
i
shall
maybe
i
sha
she
replied
doggedly
stella
wants
to
bring
a
boy
around
to
see
me
bring
him
i
said
talk
to
him
then
she
got
a
little
confused
stella
kind
in
her
way
she
came
back
after
martin
had
gone
down
the
passage
here
kid
she
said
know
as
well
as
i
do
i
ca
bring
any
one
round
to
see
you
while
you
are
sitting
around
in
those
rags
let
me
lend
you
well
i
stopped
her
short
at
that
own
plumes
or
none
at
all
i
told
her
i
just
as
soon
he
did
come
anyway
you
a
queer
girl
philip
exclaimed
where
your
father
usual
place
she
answered
in
bed
he
never
gets
up
till
five
let
me
order
lunch
up
here
for
both
of
us
from
the
restaurant
he
suggested
she
shook
her
head
no
thanks
why
not
he
persisted
i
going
round
to
the
office
to
see
if
i
can
get
any
extra
work
but
you
got
to
lunch
some
time
he
persisted
she
laughed
a
little
hardly
have
i
we
girls
have
got
to
eat
like
you
men
i
call
up
towards
the
evening
and
see
if
you
anything
ready
for
me
she
was
gone
before
he
could
stop
her
he
turned
back
to
his
desk
and
seated
himself
the
sight
of
his
last
finished
sentence
presented
itself
suddenly
in
a
new
light
there
was
a
suggestiveness
about
it
which
was
almost
poignant
he
took
up
his
pen
and
began
to
write
rapidly
chapter
iv
it
was
a
few
minutes
after
six
that
evening
when
philip
was
conscious
of
a
knock
at
his
door
he
swung
around
in
his
chair
blinking
a
little
come
in
martha
grimes
entered
she
was
in
outdoor
apparel
that
is
to
say
she
wore
her
hat
and
a
long
mackintosh
she
remained
standing
upon
the
threshold
just
looked
up
to
see
if
you
got
any
more
work
ready
she
explained
he
sprang
to
his
feet
and
stood
there
for
a
moment
unsteadily
come
in
and
shut
the
door
he
ordered
look
look
he
added
pointing
to
his
table
sheets
i
been
working
all
the
time
been
living
i
tell
you
living
god
knows
where
not
in
this
accursed
little
world
here
let
pick
up
the
sheets
there
enough
work
for
you
she
looked
at
him
curiously
have
you
been
in
that
chair
ever
since
she
asked
ever
since
he
assented
enthusiastically
any
lunch
not
a
scrap
never
thought
about
it
you
make
yourself
sick
that
what
you
do
she
declared
go
out
and
get
something
at
once
never
even
thought
about
lunch
he
repeated
half
to
himself
where
have
you
been
some
luck
she
replied
first
place
i
dropped
in
at
found
there
was
a
girl
gone
home
for
the
day
fainted
lots
of
work
to
do
so
they
just
stuck
me
down
in
her
chair
three
dollars
they
gave
me
the
girl
coming
back
though
worse
luck
when
did
you
have
your
lunch
have
had
any
i
going
to
make
myself
a
cup
of
tea
now
he
reached
for
his
hat
not
on
your
life
he
exclaimed

along

martha
grimes
i
have
written
lines
you
just
wait
till
you
type
them
i
tell
you
what
i
have
had
at
the
back
of
my
head
for
months

there
now
on
paper

words

along
where

going
to
eat
he
insisted

to
that
same
place
and

have
lunch
and
dinner

she
snapped
you

some
more
people
who
recognise

he
waved
his
hand
contemptuously
who
cares
if
you
do
come
along
with
me

up
town
to
the
waldorf
or
the
ritz
carlton

same
little
quiet
corner

friends

there
again
stella
wo
she
admitted
doubtfully
she
going
to
sherry
just
as
soon
be
out
she
went
on
ruminatingly
should
be
surprised
if
she
did
bring
that
guy
in
after
all
he
had
already
rung
the
bell
of
the
lift
look
at
me
she
exclaimed
ironically
nice
sort
of
an
object
i
am
to
take
out
got
a
raincoat
on
though
it
dry
enough
because
my
gone
at
the
seams
if
you
do
stop
talking
like
that
he
declared
i
march
into
one
of
those
great
stores
and
order
everything
a
woman
wants
to
wear
look
at
me
did
you
ever
see
such
clothes
a
man
different
she
protested
besides
you
got
a
way
with
you
of
looking
as
though
you
could
wear
better
clothes
if
you
wanted
to
something
superior
i
do
like
it
i
should
like
you
better
if
you
were
common
you
going
to
like
me
better
he
assured
her
because
we
are
going
to
have
a
cocktail
together
within
the
next
three
minutes
look
at
you
pale
as
you
can
stick
i
bet
you
have
had
a
mouthful
of
food
all
day
neither
have
i
except
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
with
my
tea
this
morning
we
a
nice
sort
of
couple
to
talk
about
clothes
what
we
want
is
food
she
swayed
for
a
moment
and
pretended
that
she
tripped
he
caught
her
arm
and
steadied
her
she
jerked
it
from
him
have
your
own
way
she
yielded
they
reached
the
corner
of
the
street
plunged
into
the
surging
crowds
of
broadway
passed
into
the
huge
restaurant
were
once
more
pounced
upon
by
a
businesslike
but
slightly
patronizing
maître
and
escorted
to
a
remote
table
in
a
sort
of
annex
of
the
room
philip
pushed
the
menu
away
two
cocktails
the
quickest
you
ever
mixed
in
your
life
he
ordered
quicker
than
that
mind
the
man
was
back
again
almost
at
once
with
two
frosted
glasses
upon
a
tray
they
laughed
together
almost
like
children
as
they
set
them
down
empty
i
know
what
i
want
and
you
too
by
the
look
of
you
he
continued
a
beefsteak
with
some
more
of
that
green
corn
you
gave
me
the
other
day
and
fried
potatoes
and
burgundy
we
have
some
oysters
first
while
we
wait
she
sighed
i
do
mean
to
come
here
with
you
again
she
said
a
little
impatiently
i
do
know
why
i
give
in
to
you
you
not
strong
you
know
you
are
a
weak
man
women
will
always
look
after
you
always
help
you
in
trouble
i
suppose
they
always
care
for
you
think
why
i
do
what
you
want
me
to
guess
i
was
near
starving
he
laughed
you
do
know
much
about
me
yet
he
reminded
her
you
do
know
much
about
yourself
she
retorted
glibly
why
according
to
your
own
confession
you
only
started
life
a
few
weeks
ago
i
fancy
what
went
before
did
count
for
much
you
been
fretted
and
tied
up
somewhere
you
have
had
the
chance
of
getting
big
like
so
many
of
our
american
men
what
are
you
going
to
do
with
this
play
of
yours
miss
elizabeth
dalstan
has
promised
to
produce
it
he
told
her
she
looked
at
him
in
some
surprise
elizabeth
dalstan
she
repeated
why
she
one
of
our
best
actresses
i
understood
so
he
replied
she
has
heard
the
story
in
fact
i
wrote
out
one
of
the
scenes
with
her
she
is
going
to
produce
it
as
soon
as
it
finished
well
all
you
poor
idiots
who
write
things
have
some
fine
tale
to
tell
their
typewriter
she
remarked
you
seem
as
though
you
mean
it
though
where
did
you
meet
elizabeth
dalstan
i
came
over
with
her
on
the
he
answered
thoughtlessly
she
gave
a
little
start
then
she
turned
upon
him
almost
in
anger
well
of
all
the
simpletons
she
exclaimed
so
that
the
way
you
give
yourself
away
is
it
just
here
from
jamaica
eh
nothing
to
do
with
douglas
romilly
never
heard
of
the
did
you
i
like
to
see
you
on
the
grid
at
police
headquarters
for
five
minutes
with
one
of
our
men
asking
you
a
few
friendly
questions
you
look
well
you
would
you
ought
to
go
about
with
a
nurse
philip
had
all
the
appearance
of
a
guilty
child
you
see
he
explained
penitently
i
am
new
to
this
sort
of
thing
however
you
know
now
still
ready
to
swear
that
you
not
douglas
romilly
i
suppose
on
my
honour
i
am
not
he
replied
kind
of
funny
that
you
should
have
been
on
the
steamer
after
all
she
jeered
perhaps
so
but
i
am
not
douglas
romilly
he
persisted
she
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
what
do
i
care
who
your
are
she
said
here
help
me
off
with
this
raincoat
please
it
warm
in
here
thank
goodness
he
looked
at
her
as
she
sat
by
his
side
in
her
plain
black
dress
and
was
impressed
for
the
first
time
with
a
certain
unsuspected
grace
of
outline
which
made
him
for
the
moment
oblivious
of
the
shabbiness
of
her
gown
you
have
rather
a
nice
figure
he
told
her
with
a
sudden
impulse
of
ingenuousness
she
turned
upon
him
almost
furiously
something
in
his
expression
however
seemed
to
disarm
her
she
closed
her
lips
again
you
are
nothing
but
a
child
she
declared
you
do
mean
anything
i
be
a
fool
to
be
angry
with
you
the
waiter
brought
their
steak
philip
was
conscious
of
something
in
his
companion
eyes
which
almost
horrified
him
it
was
just
that
gleam
of
hungry
desire
which
has
starvation
for
its
background
do
let
talk
he
pleaded
there
is
any
conversation
in
the
world
as
good
as
this
the
waiter
served
them
and
withdrew
casting
a
curious
glance
behind
they
were
from
his
point
of
view
a
strange
couple
for
cosmopolitan
though
the
restaurant
was
money
was
plentiful
in
the
neighbourhood
and
clients
as
shabby
as
these
two
seldom
presented
themselves
he
pointed
them
out
to
a
maître
who
in
his
turn
whispered
a
few
words
concerning
them
to
a
dark
man
with
keen
eyes
and
a
hard
mouth
who
was
dining
by
himself
the
latter
glanced
at
them
and
nodded
thank
you
charles
he
said
i
had
my
eye
on
them
the
girl
a
pauper
daughter
of
that
old
fool
grimes
the
actor
does
a
little
typewriting
precious
little
i
should
think
from
the
look
of
her
the
man
interesting
do
talk
about
them
understand
the
maître
bowed
i
understand
inspector
not
much
any
one
can
tell
you
sir
pays
his
bill
in
american
money
i
suppose
the
diner
asked
i
ascertain
for
you
dane
charles
replied
i
believe
he
is
an
englishman
name
of
merton
ware
the
inspector
agreed
nodding
just
arrived
from
jamaica
writes
some
sort
of
stuff
which
the
girl
with
him
typewrites
that
his
story
he
probably
as
harmless
as
a
baby
charles
bowed
and
moved
away
his
smile
was
inscrutable
chapter
v
new
york
became
a
changed
city
to
philip
its
roar
and
its
turmoil
its
babel
of
tongues
speaking
to
him
always
in
some
alien
language
were
suddenly
hushed
he
was
no
longer
conscious
of
the
hard
unconcern
of
a
million
faces
of
the
crude
buildings
in
the
streets
the
cutting
winds
the
curious
depressing
sense
of
being
on
a
desert
island
the
hermit
clutching
at
the
sleeves
of
imaginary
multitudes
a
few
minutes
journey
in
a
cable
car
which
seemed
to
crawl
a
few
minutes
swift
walking
along
the
broad
thoroughfare
of
fifth
avenue
where
his
feet
seemed
to
fall
upon
the
air
and
the
passersby
seemed
to
smile
upon
him
like
real
human
beings
and
he
was
in
her
room
it
was
only
an
hotel
sitting
room
after
all
but
eloquent
of
her
a
sitting
room
filled
with
great
bowls
of
roses
with
comfortable
furniture
of
satin
white
walls
and
an
english
fire
upon
the
grate
elizabeth
was
in
new
york
and
the
world
moved
differently
she
came
out
to
him
from
an
inner
room
almost
at
once
his
eyes
swept
over
her
feverishly
he
almost
held
his
breath
then
he
gave
a
great
sigh
of
satisfaction
she
came
with
her
hands
outstretched
a
welcoming
smile
upon
her
lips
she
was
just
as
he
had
expected
to
find
her
there
was
nothing
in
her
manner
to
indicate
that
they
had
not
parted
yesterday
welcome
to
new
york
my
dramatist
she
exclaimed
i
am
here
you
see
to
the
day
almost
to
the
hour
he
stood
there
holding
her
hands
his
eyes
seemed
to
be
devouring
her
go
on
talking
to
me
he
begged
let
me
hear
you
speak
you
think
you
ca
imagine
how
often
in
the
middle
of
the
night
i
have
waked
up
and
thought
of
you
and
the
cold
shivers
have
come
because
after
all
i
fancied
that
you
must
be
a
dream
that
you
did
really
exist
that
that
voyage
had
never
existed
go
on
talking
you
foolish
person
she
laughed
patting
his
hands
affectionately
but
then
of
course
you
are
a
little
overwrought
i
am
very
real
i
can
assure
you
i
have
been
in
chicago
playing
but
there
has
been
a
night
when
i
have
thought
of
the
times
when
we
used
to
talk
together
in
the
darkness
when
you
let
me
into
your
life
and
i
made
up
my
mind
to
try
and
help
you
foolish
person
sit
down
in
that
great
and
draw
it
up
to
the
fire
he
sank
into
it
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
she
threw
herself
on
to
the
couch
opposite
to
him
her
hands
drooped
down
a
little
wearily
on
either
side
her
head
was
thrown
back
against
the
background
of
cushions
her
cheeks
seemed
unexpectedly
pale
i
am
tired
with
travelling
she
murmured
and
i
hate
chicago
and
i
have
worried
about
you
day
by
day
i
have
read
the
papers
everything
has
gone
well
so
far
as
i
know
he
answered
i
did
exactly
as
we
planned
or
rather
as
you
planned
the
papers
have
been
full
of
the
disappearance
of
douglas
romilly
you
read
how
wonderfully
it
has
all
turned
out
fate
has
provided
him
with
a
real
reason
for
disappearing
it
seems
that
the
business
was
bankrupt
you
must
forget
though
she
reminded
him
that
that
also
supplies
a
considerable
motive
for
tracking
him
down
he
is
supposed
to
have
at
least
twenty
thousand
pounds
with
him
i
have
all
the
papers
he
went
on
they
prove
that
he
knew
the
state
the
business
was
in
they
prove
that
he
really
intended
to
disappear
in
new
york
the
money
stands
to
the
credit
of
merton
ware
and
another
at
a
bank
with
which
his
firm
apparently
had
had
no
connections
a
small
bank
in
wall
street
so
that
she
remarked
is
where
you
get
your
pseudonym
from
it
makes
the
identification
so
easy
he
pointed
out
and
no
one
knew
of
it
except
he
i
could
easily
get
a
witness
presently
to
prove
that
i
am
merton
ware
you
have
drawn
the
money
yet
then
i
have
been
near
the
bank
he
replied
i
still
have
over
a
thousand
dollars
money
he
had
with
him
sometimes
i
think
that
if
i
could
like
to
leave
that
twenty
thousand
pounds
where
it
is
i
should
like
some
day
if
i
could
do
so
without
suspicion
to
let
the
creditors
of
the
firm
have
it
back
again
what
do
you
think
she
nodded
i
would
rather
you
did
touch
it
yourself
she
agreed
i
think
you
find
too
that
you
be
able
to
earn
quite
enough
without
wanting
it
nothing
disturbing
has
happened
to
you
at
all
then
once
i
had
a
fright
he
told
her
i
was
in
a
restaurant
close
to
my
hotel
i
was
there
with
a
young
woman
who
is
typing
the
play
for
me
she
looked
towards
him
incredulously
you
were
there
with
a
typewriter
she
exclaimed
i
suppose
it
seems
queer
he
admitted
it
did
to
me
she
is
a
plain
shabby
half
starved
little
thing
fighting
her
own
battle
bravely
she
came
to
me
for
work
she
lives
in
the
flat
below
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
she
was
just
as
hungry
for
a
kind
word
as
i
was
lonely
and
i
took
her
out
with
me
twice
i
have
taken
her
her
name
is
miss
grimes
i
am
not
in
the
least
sure
that
i
approve
she
said
but
go
on
a
friend
of
hers
came
into
the
restaurant
a
girl
in
the
chorus
of
a
musical
comedy
here
and
she
had
with
her
a
young
man
i
recognised
him
at
once
we
did
come
across
one
another
much
but
he
was
on
the
steamer
elizabeth
face
was
full
of
concern
go
on
he
asked
me
twice
if
i
was
romilly
i
assured
him
that
he
was
mistaken
i
do
think
i
gave
myself
away
the
next
day
he
went
to
see
the
girl
i
was
with
martha
grimes
well
what
did
she
tell
him
she
told
him
that
she
had
been
typing
my
work
for
over
a
month
that
i
had
come
from
jamaica
and
that
my
name
was
merton
ware
elizabeth
gazed
into
the
fire
for
several
moments
and
philip
watched
her
it
was
a
woman
face
grave
and
thoughtful
a
little
perturbed
just
then
as
though
by
some
unwelcome
thought
presently
she
looked
back
at
him
looked
into
his
eyes
long
and
earnestly
my
friend
she
said
you
are
like
no
one
else
on
earth
perhaps
you
are
one
of
those
horrible
people
who
have
what
they
call
an
unholy
influence
over
my
sex
you
have
known
this
girl
for
a
matter
of
a
few
days
and
she
lies
for
you
and
there
five
hundred
dollars
reward
i
suppose
she
knew
about
that
yes
she
knew
he
admitted
she
simply
is
that
sort
i
suppose
i
realised
that
or
i
should
have
been
kind
to
her
it
a
puzzle
she
went
on
i
think
there
must
be
something
in
you
of
the
weakling
you
know
something
that
appeals
to
the
mothering
instinct
in
women
i
know
that
my
first
feeling
for
you
was
that
i
wanted
to
help
you
tell
me
what
you
think
of
yourself
philip
merton
ware
are
you
a
faithful
person
are
you
conscientious
have
you
a
heart
i
wonder
how
much
of
the
man
is
there
underneath
that
strong
frame
of
yours
are
you
going
to
take
just
the
things
that
are
given
you
in
life
and
make
no
return
for
the
moment
you
see
i
am
forgetting
that
you
are
my
friend
and
that
i
like
you
i
am
thinking
of
you
from
the
point
of
view
of
an
actress
as
a
psychical
problem
philip
you
idiot
she
broke
off
suddenly
stamping
her
foot
do
sit
there
looking
at
me
with
your
great
eyes
tell
me
you
are
glad
i
come
back
tell
me
you
feel
something
for
goodness
sake
he
was
on
his
knees
before
she
could
check
him
his
arms
his
lips
praying
for
her
she
thrust
him
back
it
was
my
fault
she
declared
but
do
please
yes
of
course
you
have
feelings
i
do
know
why
you
tempted
me
to
that
little
outburst
you
tempt
me
to
more
than
that
he
cried
passionately
do
you
think
it
for
your
help
that
i
thought
of
you
do
you
think
it
because
you
an
angel
to
me
because
you
comforted
me
in
my
darkest
most
miserable
hours
that
i
dreamed
of
you
and
craved
for
you
there
more
than
that
in
my
thoughts
dear
it
because
you
are
you
yourself
that
i
longed
for
you
through
the
aching
hours
of
the
night
that
i
sat
and
written
like
a
man
beside
himself
just
for
the
joy
of
thinking
that
the
words
i
wrote
would
be
spoken
by
you
oh
if
you
want
me
to
tell
you
what
i
feel
she
suddenly
leaned
forward
took
his
head
between
her
hands
and
kissed
his
forehead
now
get
back
please
to
your
chair
she
begged
you
stilled
the
horrible
miserable
little
doubt
that
was
tearing
at
my
heartstrings
i
just
had
it
before
once
or
twice
and
then
is
it
foolish
your
telling
me
about
this
little
typewriter
girl
i
must
go
and
see
her
we
must
be
kind
to
her
he
resumed
his
seat
with
a
little
sigh
she
thought
a
great
deal
more
of
me
and
my
work
when
i
told
her
that
you
were
probably
going
to
act
in
my
play
her
expression
changed
she
was
more
serious
at
the
same
time
more
eager
ah
the
play
she
exclaimed
i
can
see
that
you
have
brought
some
of
it
he
drew
the
roll
of
manuscript
from
his
pocket
shall
i
read
it
he
suggested
she
almost
snatched
it
away
no
i
ca
wait
for
that
give
it
to
me
quickly
she
leaned
forward
so
that
the
firelight
fell
upon
the
pages
little
strands
of
soft
brown
hair
drooped
over
her
face
in
studying
her
philip
almost
forgot
his
own
anxiety
he
had
known
so
few
women
yet
he
had
watched
so
many
from
afar
off
endowed
them
with
their
natural
qualities
built
up
their
lives
and
tastes
for
them
and
found
them
all
so
sadly
wanting
to
him
elizabeth
represented
everything
that
was
desirable
in
her
sex
from
the
flowing
lines
of
her
beautiful
body
to
the
sympathy
which
seemed
to
be
always
shining
out
of
her
eyes
notwithstanding
her
strength
she
was
so
exquisitely
and
entirely
feminine
a
creature
of
silk
and
laces
free
from
any
effort
of
provocativeness
yet
subtly
almost
clamorously
human
he
forgot
in
those
few
moments
that
she
had
become
the
arbitress
of
his
material
fate
that
he
was
a
humble
author
watching
the
effect
of
his
first
attempts
upon
a
mistress
in
her
profession
he
remembered
only
that
she
was
the
woman
who
was
filling
his
life
stealing
into
every
corner
of
it
permeating
him
with
love
pointing
him
onwards
towards
a
life
indescribable
unrealisable
she
swung
suddenly
towards
him
there
was
a
certain
amount
of
enthusiasm
in
her
face
but
even
more
marked
was
her
relief
oh
i
am
so
glad
she
cried
you
know
i
have
had
qualms
when
you
told
me
the
story
in
your
own
words
picking
your
language
so
carefully
and
building
it
all
up
before
me
well
you
know
what
i
said
i
gave
you
more
than
hope
i
promised
you
success
and
then
when
i
got
away
into
the
hard
stagey
world
of
chicago
and
my
manager
talked
business
to
me
and
my
last
playwright
preached
of
technique
i
began
to
wonder
whether
after
all
you
could
bring
your
ideas
together
like
this
whether
you
would
have
a
sense
of
perspective
you
know
what
i
mean
do
you
and
you
have
it
and
the
play
is
going
to
be
wonderful
and
i
shall
produce
it
why
do
you
look
pleased
mr
author
you
are
going
to
be
famous
he
smiled
i
do
care
about
fame
he
said
and
for
the
rest
i
think
i
knew
conceited
she
exclaimed
it
was
that
he
protested
it
was
simply
when
i
sat
down
in
that
little
room
high
up
over
the
roofs
and
buildings
of
a
strange
city
shut
myself
in
and
told
myself
that
it
was
for
you
well
the
thoughts
came
too
easily
they
tumbled
over
one
another
and
when
i
looked
away
from
my
work
i
saw
the
people
moving
around
me
and
i
knew
that
i
had
made
my
dreams
real
and
that
the
great
thing
is
it
elizabeth
well
i
am
lonely
in
that
little
room
you
lonely
taking
out
typewriters
to
dine
she
mocked
tenderly
it
is
lonely
he
repeated
and
i
am
afraid
of
you
here
in
all
this
luxury
i
am
so
far
away
i
come
from
my
attic
to
this
and
i
am
afraid
do
you
know
why
she
sat
quite
still
for
a
moment
dimly
she
felt
the
presage
of
a
coming
change
in
their
relations
up
to
now
she
had
been
the
mistress
she
had
held
him
so
easily
in
check
with
her
practised
skill
with
an
unfinished
sentence
a
look
a
touch
and
now
the
man
was
rising
up
in
him
and
she
felt
her
powers
weaken
shall
i
change
my
abode
she
murmured
ah
but
you
would
be
just
as
wonderful
and
as
far
away
even
if
we
changed
places
if
you
sat
in
my
attic
and
i
took
your
place
here
that
is
why
i
torture
myself
why
i
am
always
asking
myself
if
you
are
real
if
the
things
we
talk
about
are
real
if
the
things
we
feel
belong
to
ourselves
well
up
from
our
own
hearts
for
one
another
or
are
just
the
secondary
emotions
of
other
people
we
catch
up
without
knowing
why
this
is
foolish
but
you
understand
you
do
understand
it
is
because
you
keep
me
so
far
away
from
yourself
when
my
fingers
are
burning
for
yours
when
even
to
touch
your
face
to
feel
your
cheek
against
mine
would
banish
every
fear
i
have
ever
had
elizabeth
you
do
understand
i
have
never
kissed
you
i
have
never
held
you
for
one
moment
in
my
arms
and
i
love
you
he
was
leaning
over
her
chair
and
she
held
him
tightly
by
the
shoulders
there
was
nothing
left
of
that
hidden
fear
in
his
dark
eyes
they
shone
now
with
another
light
and
she
began
to
tremble
i
wanted
to
wait
a
little
philip
but
if
you
feel
like
that
well
i
ca
he
took
her
silently
into
his
arms
with
the
half
closing
of
her
eyes
the
first
touch
of
her
responsive
lips
himself
dimly
conscious
of
the
change
he
passed
into
the
world
where
stronger
men
live
book

chapter
i
three
months
later
a
very
different
philip
stood
in
the
smaller
of
a
handsome
suite
of
reception
rooms
in
a
fashionable
fifth
avenue
hotel
he
was
wearing
evening
clothes
of
the
most
approved
cut
and
carried
himself
with
a
dignity
and
assurance
entirely
transforming
the
distinction
of
birth
and
breeding
little
apparent
in
those
passionate
days
of
his
misery
had
come
easily
to
the
surface
his
shoulders
too
seemed
to
have
broadened
and
his
face
had
lost
its
cadaverous
pallor
the
apartment
in
which
he
stood
was
plainly
but
handsomely
furnished
as
a
small
withdrawing
room
on
the
oak
chiffonier
stood
a
silver
tray
on
which
were
half
a
dozen
frosted
cocktails
through
the
curtains
was
apparent
a
room
beyond
in
which
a
round
table
smothered
with
flowers
was
arranged
for
supper
in
the
distance
from
the
public
restaurant
came
the
sound
of
softly
played
music
philip
glanced
at
the
clock
the
whole
of
the
anxieties
of
this
momentous
evening
had
passed
telephone
messages
had
reached
him
every
quarter
of
an
hour
the
play
was
a
great
success
elizabeth
was
coming
to
him
with
her
producer
and
a
few
theatrical
friends
flushed
with
triumph
they
were
all
to
meet
for
the
first
time
that
night
the
man
who
for
the
last
three
months
had
lived
as
a
hermit
merton
ware
the
author
of
the
house
of
shams
the
dramatist
a
maître
appeared
in
the
space
between
the
two
rooms
and
bowed
everything
is
quite
ready
ware
he
said
in
the
friendly
yet
deferential
manner
of
an
american
wo
you
take
a
cocktail
sir
while
you
are
waiting
very
thoughtful
of
you
louis
i
think
i
will
philip
assented
taking
a
little
case
from
his
pocket
and
lighting
a
cigarette
the
man
passed
him
a
glass
upon
a
small
salver
you
pardon
the
liberty
i
am
sure
sir
he
continued
dropping
his
voice
a
little
i
just
heard
that
house
of
shams
seems
to
be
a
huge
success
sir
if
i
might
take
the
liberty
of
offering
my
congratulations
philip
smiled
genially
you
are
the
first
louis
he
said
thank
you
very
much
indeed
i
think
you
will
find
the
supper
everything
that
could
be
desired
ware
the
man
went
on
our
head
chef
monsieur
raconnot
has
given
it
his
personal
attention
the
wine
will
be
slightly
iced
as
you
desired
i
shall
be
outside
in
the
corridor
to
announce
the
guests
capital
louis
ware
replied
sipping
his
cocktail
it
will
be
another
quarter
of
an
hour
yet
before
we
see
anything
of
them
i
am
afraid
the
man
disappeared
and
left
philip
once
more
alone
he
looked
through
the
walls
of
the
room
as
though
indeed
he
could
see
into
the
packed
theatre
and
could
hear
the
cries
for
author
which
even
then
were
echoing
through
the
house
from
the
moment
when
elizabeth
abandoning
her
reserve
had
given
him
the
love
he
craved
a
new
strength
seemed
to
have
shone
out
of
the
man
step
by
step
he
had
thought
out
subtly
and
with
infinite
care
every
small
detail
of
his
life
it
was
he
who
had
elected
to
live
those
three
months
in
absolute
seclusion
it
was
he
indirectly
who
had
arranged
that
many
more
photographs
of
douglas
romilly
the
english
shoe
manufacturer
should
appear
in
the
newspapers
one
horror
he
had
certainly
had
he
could
see
the
little
paragraph
now
almost
lost
in
the
shoals
of
more
important
news
ghastly
discovery
in
a
derbyshire
canal
yesterday
the
police
recovered
the
body
of
a
man
who
had
apparently
been
dead
for
some
weeks
from
a
canal
close
to
detton
magna
the
body
was
unrecognisable
but
it
is
believed
that
the
remains
are
those
of
philip
romilly
the
missing
art
teacher
from
london
who
is
alleged
to
have
committed
suicide
in
january
last
the
thought
of
that
gruesome
find
scarcely
blanched
his
cheeks
his
nerves
now
were
stronger
and
tenser
things
he
crushed
back
those
memories
with
all
the
strength
of
his
will
whatever
might
lie
behind
he
had
struck
for
the
future
which
he
meant
to
live
and
enjoy
they
were
only
weaklings
who
brooded
over
an
unalterable
past
it
was
for
the
present
and
the
near
future
that
he
lived
and
both
in
that
moment
were
more
alluring
than
ever
before
even
his
intellectual
powers
seemed
to
have
developed
in
his
happiness
the
play
which
he
had
written
every
line
of
which
appeared
to
gain
in
vital
and
literary
force
towards
its
conclusion
was
only
the
first
of
his
children
already
other
images
and
ideas
were
flowing
into
his
brain
the
power
of
creation
was
triumphantly
throwing
out
its
tendrils
he
was
filled
with
an
amazing
and
almost
inspired
confidence
he
was
ready
to
start
upon
fresh
work
that
hour
or
when
he
chose
and
before
him
now
was
the
prospect
of
stimulating
companionship
elizabeth
and
he
had
decided
that
the
time
had
come
for
him
to
take
his
fate
into
his
hands
he
was
to
be
introduced
to
the
magnates
of
the
dramatic
profession
to
become
a
clubman
in
the
world
most
hospitable
city
to
mix
freely
in
the
circles
where
he
would
find
himself
in
constant
association
with
the
keenest
brains
and
most
brilliant
men
of
letters
in
the
world
he
was
safe
they
had
both
decided
it
he
walked
to
the
mirror
and
looked
at
himself
the
nervous
neurotic
stripling
had
become
the
perfectly
assured
and
man
of
the
world
he
had
studied
various
details
with
a
peculiar
care
suffered
a
barber
to
take
summary
measures
with
his
overlong
black
hair
had
accustomed
himself
to
the
use
of
an
eyeglass
which
hung
around
his
neck
by
a
thin
black
ribbon
men
might
talk
of
likenesses
men
who
were
close
students
of
their
fellows
yet
there
was
no
living
person
who
could
point
to
him
and
say
you
are
beyond
a
shadow
of
doubt
a
man
with
whom
i
travelled
on
the
the
thing
was
impossible
louis
once
more
made
a
noiseless
appearance
there
was
the
slightest
of
frowns
upon
his
face
a
gentleman
wishes
a
word
with
you
before
the
arrival
of
your
guests
ware
he
announced
a
journalist
philip
enquired
carelessly
i
do
not
think
so
sir
even
as
he
spoke
the
door
was
opened
and
closed
again
the
man
who
had
entered
bowed
slightly
to
philip
he
was
tall
and
and
with
manner
almost
significantly
reserved
he
held
a
bowler
hat
in
his
hand
and
glanced
towards
louis
he
had
the
air
of
being
somewhat
out
of
place
in
so
fashionable
a
rendezvous
good
evening
mr
ware
he
began
could
i
have
just
a
word
with
you
philip
nodded
to
louis
who
at
once
left
the
room
the
newcomer
drew
a
little
nearer
my
name
sir
he
said
is
dane
edward
dane
philip
bowed
politely
he
was
just
a
little
annoyed
at
the
intrusion
an
annoyance
which
he
failed
altogether
to
conceal
what
do
you
want
with
me
he
asked
i
am
expecting
some
friends
to
supper
in
about
ten
minutes
ten
minutes
will
perhaps
be
sufficient
for
what
i
have
to
say
the
other
promised
you
do
know
me
then
mr
ware
never
saw
you
before
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
philip
replied
nonchalantly
are
you
a
journalist
the
man
laid
his
hat
upon
a
corner
of
the
table
i
am
a
detective
he
said
attached
to
the
cherry
street
headquarters
your
last
rooms
ware
were
in
my
beat
philip
nodded
with
some
slight
indication
of
interest
he
faced
his
ordeal
with
the
courage
of
a
man
of
steel
that
so
he
remarked
indifferently
well
dane
i
have
heard
a
good
deal
about
you
american
detectives
pleased
to
meet
you
what
can
i
do
for
you
the
detective
eyed
philip
steadfastly
there
was
just
the
shadow
of
something
that
looked
like
admiration
in
his
hard
grey
eyes
well
ware
he
said
nothing
that
need
disturb
your
supper
party
i
am
sure
over
in
this
country
we
sometimes
do
things
in
an
unusual
way
that
why
i
am
paying
you
this
visit
i
have
been
watching
you
for
exactly
three
months
and
fourteen
days
watching
me
philip
repeated
precisely
no
idea
why
i
suppose
not
the
slightest
the
detective
glanced
towards
the
clock
barely
two
minutes
had
passed
well
he
explained
i
got
on
your
tracks
quick
enough
when
you
skipped
from
the
waldorf
and
blossomed
out
in
a
tenement
house
as
merton
ware
so
i
was
at
the
waldorf
was
i
philip
murmured
you
crossed
from
liverpool
on
the
the
man
continued
registered
at
the
waldorf
as
douglas
romilly
of
the
douglas
romilly
shoe
company
went
to
your
room
changed
your
clothes
and
disappeared
of
course
a
disappearance
of
that
sort
he
went
on
tolerantly
might
be
possible
in
london
in
new
york
to
even
attempt
it
is
farcical
dear
me
remarked
philip
this
is
very
interesting
let
me
ask
you
this
question
though
if
you
were
so
sure
of
your
facts
why
did
you
arrest
me
at
once
instead
of
just
watching
me
the
man
eyes
were
like
gimlets
he
seemed
as
though
he
were
trying
with
curious
and
professional
intensity
to
read
the
thoughts
in
brain
there
is
no
criminal
charge
against
douglas
romilly
that
i
know
of
he
said
there
a
considerable
reward
offered
for
his
discovery
philip
reminded
him
i
can
claim
that
at
any
moment
the
man
replied
i
have
had
my
reasons
for
waiting
it
partly
those
reasons
that
have
brought
me
here
for
one
thing
douglas
romilly
was
supposed
to
be
able
to
put
his
hand
on
a
matter
of
a
hundred
thousand
dollars
somewhere
in
new
york
you
shown
many
signs
up
till
now
ware
of
having
any
such
sum
in
your
possession
i
see
philip
assented
you
wanted
the
money
as
well
the
creditors
of
the
douglas
romilly
shoe
company
are
wanting
it
pretty
badly
the
man
proceeded
but
that
was
all
i
wanted
to
find
out
what
your
game
was
that
i
do
know
even
now
that
is
why
i
have
come
to
you
have
i
the
pleasure
of
speaking
to
douglas
romilly
i
really
do
see
philip
protested
thoughtfully
why
i
should
go
into
partnership
with
you
in
this
affair
you
see
in
the
long
run
our
interests
might
not
be
altogether
identical
dane
smiled
grimly
that
a
fairly
shrewd
calculation
ware
he
admitted
you
bound
to
answer
any
question
you
do
want
to
this
is
just
a
friendly
chat
and
no
more
besides
philip
continued
lighting
another
cigarette
i
think
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
had
already
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
i
was
douglas
romilly
not
precisely
that
the
detective
replied
all
that
i
discovered
was
that
you
were
the
man
who
registered
at
the
waldorf
hotel
as
douglas
romilly
well
the
only
name
i
choose
to
acknowledge
at
present
is
the
name
of
merton
ware
philip
declared
if
you
think
there
is
any
mystery
about
me
any
connection
with
the
gentleman
whom
i
believe
you
call
douglas
romilly
well
the
matter
is
one
for
your
investigation
you
will
forgive
me
if
i
remind
you
that
my
guests
will
be
here
in
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
and
permit
me
to
ask
you
one
more
question
why
do
you
come
here
to
me
in
this
very
unofficial
manner
if
i
am
really
an
impostor
you
are
giving
me
every
opportunity
of
clearing
out
edward
dane
shook
his
head
he
was
fingering
the
brim
of
his
hat
oh
no
mr
ware
he
declared
smoothly
our
detective
system
may
have
some
faults
but
when
a
man
name
is
put
on
the
list
where
yours
figures
he
has
not
one
chance
in
a
million
of
leaving
the
country
or
of
gaining
any
place
of
hiding
i
shall
know
where
you
lunch
and
with
whom
you
dine
and
with
whom
you
spend
your
time
the
law
sir
will
keep
its
eye
upon
you
really
that
seems
very
friendly
philip
said
coolly
shall
i
have
the
privilege
of
your
personal
surveillance
i
think
not
ware
to
tell
you
the
truth
this
is
rather
a
visit
i
booked
my
passage
on
the
sailing
from
new
york
i
am
taking
a
trip
over
to
england
to
make
a
few
enquiries
round
about
the
spot
where
this
douglas
romilly
hails
from
detton
magna
is
it
philip
made
no
reply
yet
even
his
silence
might
well
have
been
the
silence
of
indifference
at
the
last
moment
the
detective
concluded
it
flashed
in
upon
me
that
there
might
be
some
ridiculous
explanation
of
the
few
little
points
about
your
case
which
i
must
confess
have
puzzled
me
for
that
reason
i
decided
to
seek
an
interview
with
you
before
i
left
you
have
however
i
gather
nothing
to
say
to
me
nothing
at
all
dane
except
to
wish
you
a
pleasant
voyage
philip
declared
i
wo
detain
you
a
moment
longer
i
hear
my
guests
in
the
corridor
good
night
sir
he
added
opening
the
door
i
appreciate
your
call
very
much
come
and
see
me
again
when
you
return
from
england
dane
lingered
for
a
moment
upon
the
threshold
hat
in
hand
a
somewhat
ominous
figure
there
was
no
attempt
at
a
handshake
between
the
two
men
the
detective
was
imperturbable
philip
listening
to
elizabeth
voice
had
shown
his
first
sign
of
impatience
i
shall
surely
do
that
mr
ware
the
other
promised
as
he
passed
out
the
door
closed
philip
stood
for
a
moment
in
the
empty
room
listening
to
the
man
retreating
footsteps
then
he
turned
slowly
around
his
cheeks
were
blanched
his
eyes
were
glazed
with
reminiscent
horror
he
looked
through
the
wall
of
the
room
a
long
way
back
we
shall
find
ware
in
here
i
expect
he
could
hear
the
voices
of
his
approaching
guests
he
ground
his
heel
into
the
carpet
and
swung
around
he
anticipated
louis
threw
open
the
curtain
and
stood
there
waiting
to
welcome
his
guests
a
smile
upon
his
lips
his
hands
outstretched
towards
elizabeth
chapter
ii
elizabeth
face
was
glowing
with
joy
for
the
first
time
philip
realised
that
she
too
had
had
her
anxieties
you
dear
dear
man
she
exclaimed
to
think
what
you
have
missed
it
would
have
been
the
evening
of
your
life
it
a
success
do
you
hear
a
great
success
it
was
wonderful
he
seemed
almost
to
himself
to
be
playing
a
part
he
was
so
calm
yet
so
gracefully
happy
i
am
glad
for
both
our
sakes
he
said
she
indicated
the
others
with
a
little
wave
of
the
hand
i
do
think
you
know
a
soul
do
you
she
asked
they
none
of
them
quite
believe
in
your
existence
down
at
the
theatre
this
is
my
leading
man
noel
bridges
you
should
have
seen
how
splendid
he
was
as
carriston
noel
bridges
with
a
deprecating
smile
towards
elizabeth
held
out
his
hand
he
was
tall
and
of
rather
a
rugged
type
for
the
new
york
stage
like
the
rest
of
the
little
party
his
eyes
were
full
of
curiosity
as
he
shook
hands
with
philip
so
you
are
something
human
after
all
he
remarked
we
began
to
think
you
lived
underground
and
only
put
your
head
up
every
now
and
then
for
a
little
air
i
am
glad
to
meet
you
ware
i
enjoy
acting
in
your
play
very
much
indeed
and
i
hope
it
only
the
first
of
many
you
are
very
kind
philip
murmured
cordially
elizabeth
glanced
around
the
little
group
dear
me
i
am
forgetting
my
manners
she
declared
i
ought
to
have
presented
you
to
sara
denison
first
sara
is
really
the
star
of
your
play
ware
although
i
have
the
most
work
to
do
she
loves
her
part
and
has
asked
about
you
nearly
every
day
miss
denison
a
young
lady
of
the
smaller
gibson
type
with
large
eyes
and
a
very
constant
smile
greeted
philip
warmly
do
you
know
she
told
him
that
this
is
the
first
time
i
have
ever
been
in
a
play
in
which
the
author
has
been
round
setting
us
to
rights
most
of
the
time
i
ca
imagine
how
you
kept
away
mr
ware
perhaps
observed
philip
my
absence
has
contributed
to
your
success
i
am
sure
i
should
have
known
what
to
tell
you
you
see
i
am
so
absolutely
ignorant
of
the
technique
i
got
to
shake
hands
with
you
ware
a
stout
man
with
narrow
black
eyes
and
pale
cheeks
declared
stepping
forward
these
other
folk
do
count
for
much
by
the
side
of
me
i
am
the
manager
of
the
theatre
and
i
thundering
glad
that
your
first
play
has
been
produced
at
the
york
sir
there
good
stuff
in
it
and
if
i
am
any
judge
and
i
supposed
to
be
there
plenty
of
better
stuff
behind
shake
hands
if
you
please
sir
you
know
me
by
name
paul
fink
i
hope
you
see
my
signature
at
the
bottom
of
a
good
many
fat
cheques
before
you
finished
writing
plays
that
very
nice
of
you
fink
philip
declared
now
i
am
sure
you
all
want
your
supper
at
a
sign
from
philip
the
maître
handed
round
the
tray
of
cocktails
fink
raised
his
glass
here
success
to
the
play
he
exclaimed
and
good
luck
to
all
of
us
he
tossed
off
the
contents
of
the
glass
and
they
all
followed
his
example
then
they
took
their
places
at
the
little
round
table
and
the
service
of
supper
began
the
conversation
somewhat
naturally
centered
around
philip
the
three
strangers
were
all
interested
in
his
personality
and
the
fact
that
he
had
no
previous
work
to
his
credit
it
was
unusual
almost
dramatic
and
for
a
time
both
elizabeth
and
he
himself
found
themselves
hard
put
to
it
to
escape
the
constant
wave
of
but
very
pertinent
questions
you
have
a
dose
of
our
newspapermen
sir
fink
promised
him
they
be
buzzing
around
you
all
day
long
they
want
to
know
everything
from
where
you
get
your
clothes
and
what
cigarettes
you
smoke
to
how
you
like
best
to
do
your
work
and
what
complexioned
typist
you
prefer
they
some
boys
i
can
tell
you
philip
eyes
met
elizabeth
across
the
table
the
same
instinct
of
disquietude
kept
them
both
for
a
moment
silent
i
am
afraid
elizabeth
sighed
that
ware
will
find
it
rather
hard
to
appreciate
some
of
our
journalistic
friends
they
good
fellows
fink
declared
heartily
white
men
all
of
them
so
long
as
you
do
try
to
put
off
on
a
false
stunt
or
anything
of
that
sort
they
sling
the
ink
about
some
ed
harris
was
in
my
room
just
after
the
second
act
and
he
showed
me
some
of
his
stuff
i
tell
you
he
means
to
boost
us
elizabeth
laid
her
hand
upon
her
manager
arm
they
delightful
every
one
of
them
she
agreed
but
fink
you
have
such
influence
with
them
i
wonder
if
i
dare
give
you
just
a
hint
ware
has
passed
through
some
very
painful
times
lately
he
is
so
anxious
to
forget
and
i
really
do
wonder
at
it
myself
i
am
sure
he
will
be
delighted
to
talk
with
all
of
them
as
to
the
future
and
his
future
plans
but
do
you
think
you
could
just
drop
them
a
hint
to
go
quietly
as
regards
the
past
fink
was
a
little
perplexed
but
inclined
to
be
sympathetic
he
glanced
towards
philip
who
was
deep
in
conversation
with
sara
denison
why
i
do
my
best
miss
dalstan
he
promised
you
know
what
the
boys
are
though
they
do
love
a
story
i
am
not
going
to
have
ware
story
published
in
every
newspaper
in
new
york
elizabeth
said
firmly
and
the
newspaper
man
who
worms
the
history
of
ware
misfortunes
out
of
him
and
then
makes
use
of
it
will
be
no
friend
of
mine
ask
them
to
be
sports
fink
there
a
dear
i
do
what
i
can
he
promised
ware
is
the
first
man
in
the
world
who
has
funked
the
limelight
and
from
what
i
can
see
of
him
it
probably
was
his
fault
if
things
did
go
a
little
crooked
in
the
past
i
do
my
best
miss
dalstan
i
promise
you
that
i
look
in
at
the
club
and
drop
a
few
hints
around
elizabeth
patted
his
hand
and
smiled
at
him
very
sweetly
the
conversation
flowed
back
once
more
into
its
former
channels
became
a
medley
of
confused
chaff
disjointed
streams
of
congratulation
of
and
pleasant
speeches
then
fink
suddenly
rose
to
his
feet
say
he
exclaimed
we
all
drunk
one
another
healths
there
just
one
other
friend
i
think
we
ought
to
take
a
glass
of
wine
with
gee
he
give
something
to
be
with
us
you
agree
with
me
miss
dalstan
i
know
let
empty
a
full
glass
to
sylvanus
power
there
was
a
curious
silence
for
a
second
or
two
then
a
clamour
of
assenting
voices
for
a
single
moment
philip
felt
a
sharp
pang
at
his
heart
elizabeth
was
gazing
steadily
out
of
the
room
a
queer
tremble
at
her
lips
a
look
in
her
eyes
which
puzzled
him
a
look
almost
of
fear
of
some
sort
of
apprehension
the
moment
passed
but
her
enthusiasm
as
she
raised
her
glass
was
a
little
overdone
her
gaiety
too
easily
assumed
why
of
course
she
declared
fancy
not
thinking
of
sylvanus
they
drank
his
health
noisily
philip
set
down
his
glass
empty
a
curious
instinct
kept
his
lips
sealed
he
crushed
down
and
stifled
the
memory
of
that
sudden
stab
he
did
not
even
ask
the
one
natural
question
say
where
is
sylvanus
power
these
days
fink
enquired
in
honolulu
when
last
i
heard
elizabeth
replied
lightly
but
then
one
never
knows
really
where
he
is
philip
became
naturally
the
central
figure
of
the
little
gathering
fink
was
anxious
to
arrange
a
little
dinner
to
introduce
him
to
some
fellow
workers
noel
bridges
insisted
upon
a
card
for
the
lambs
club
and
a
luncheon
there
philip
accepted
gratefully
everything
that
was
offered
to
him
it
was
no
good
doing
things
by
halves
he
told
himself
the
days
of
his
solitude
were
over
even
when
after
the
departure
of
his
guests
he
glanced
for
a
moment
into
the
anteroom
beyond
and
remembered
those
few
throbbing
moments
of
suspense
they
came
back
to
him
with
a
curious
sense
of
unreality
they
belonged
surety
to
some
other
man
living
in
some
other
world
you
are
happy
elizabeth
murmured
as
she
took
his
arm
and
they
waited
in
the
portico
below
for
her
automobile
he
had
no
longer
any
idea
of
telling
her
of
that
disquieting
visit
the
touch
of
her
hair
blown
against
his
cheek
as
he
had
helped
her
on
with
her
cloak
something
in
her
voice
some
slight
diffidence
a
queer
half
expostulating
look
in
the
eyes
that
fell
with
a
curious
uneasiness
before
his
drove
every
thought
of
future
danger
out
of
his
mind
he
had
at
least
the
present
he
answered
without
a
moment
hesitation
for
the
first
time
in
my
life
she
gave
the
chauffeur
a
whispered
order
as
she
stepped
into
the
car
i
have
told
him
to
go
home
by
riverside
drive
she
said
as
they
glided
off
it
is
a
little
farther
and
i
love
the
air
at
this
time
of
night
he
clasped
her
fingers
suddenly
felt
with
the
leaning
of
her
body
her
heart
beating
against
his
with
that
wave
of
passion
there
was
an
instant
and
portentous
change
in
their
attitudes
the
soft
protectiveness
which
had
sometimes
seemed
to
shine
out
of
her
face
to
envelop
him
in
its
warmth
had
disappeared
she
was
no
longer
the
stronger
she
looked
at
him
almost
with
fear
and
he
was
electrically
conscious
of
all
the
vigour
and
strength
of
his
stunted
manhood
was
master
at
last
of
his
fate
accepting
battle
willing
to
fight
whatever
might
come
for
the
sake
of
the
joy
of
these
moments
she
crept
into
his
arms
almost
humbly
chapter
iii
the
success
of
the
house
of
shams
was
as
immediate
and
complete
as
was
the
social
success
of
its
author
after
a
few
attempts
philip
and
elizabeth
both
agreed
that
the
wisest
course
was
to
play
the
bold
game
to
submit
himself
to
the
photographer
the
interviewer
and
to
some
judicious
extent
to
the
wave
of
hospitality
which
flowed
in
upon
him
from
all
sides
he
threw
aside
completely
and
utterly
every
idea
of
leading
a
more
or
less
sheltered
life
his
photograph
was
in
the
sunday
newspapers
and
the
magazines
it
was
quite
easy
in
satisfying
the
appetite
of
journalists
for
copious
personal
details
especially
after
the
hints
dropped
by
fink
to
keep
them
carefully
off
the
subject
of
his
immediate
past
there
had
been
many
others
in
the
world
who
on
attaining
fame
had
preferred
to
gloss
over
their
earlier
history
it
seemed
to
be
tacitly
understood
amongst
this
wonderful
freemasonry
of
newspaper
men
that
merton
ware
was
to
be
humoured
in
this
way
he
was
a
man
of
the
present
character
sketches
of
him
were
to
be
all
foreground
but
nevertheless
philip
had
his
trials
want
to
introduce
you
to
one
of
our
chief
men
noel
bridges
said
to
him
one
day
in
the
smoking
room
of
the
lambs
he
is
much
interested
in
the
play
too
raymond
greene
shake
hands
with
merton
ware
raymond
greene
smiling
and
urbane
turned
around
with
outstretched
hand
which
philip
courteous
and
with
all
that
charm
of
manner
which
was
making
him
speedily
one
of
the
most
popular
young
men
in
new
york
grasped
cordially
i
am
very
happy
to
meet
you
greene
he
said
you
represent
an
amazing
development
i
am
told
that
we
shall
all
have
to
work
for
you
presently
or
find
our
occupation
gone
with
a
cool
calculation
which
had
come
to
philip
in
these
days
of
his
greater
strength
he
had
purposely
extended
his
sentence
conscious
although
apparently
he
ignored
the
fact
that
all
the
time
raymond
greene
was
staring
in
his
face
with
a
bewilderment
which
was
not
without
its
humorous
side
he
was
too
much
a
man
of
the
world
this
great
picture
producer
to
be
at
a
loss
for
words
to
receive
an
introduction
with
any
degree
of
clumsiness
but
surely
he
almost
stammered
we
have
met
before
philip
shook
his
head
doubtfully
i
do
think
so
he
said
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
am
sure
we
have
because
you
are
one
of
the
men
whom
i
hoped
some
day
to
come
across
over
here
i
could
possibly
have
forgotten
a
meeting
with
you
raymond
greene
blue
eyes
looked
as
though
they
saw
visions
but
surely
he
expostulated
the
my
table
on
the
when
miss
dalstan
crossed
philip
laughed
easily
why
he
exclaimed
are
you
going
to
be
like
the
others
and
take
me
for
was
it
mr
romilly
the
man
who
disappeared
from
the
waldorf
why
i
been
tracked
all
round
new
york
because
of
my
likeness
to
that
man
likeness
raymond
greene
muttered
likeness
there
was
a
moment
silence
then
greene
knew
that
the
time
had
arrived
for
him
to
pull
himself
together
he
had
carried
his
bewilderment
to
the
very
limits
of
good
breeding
well
well
he
continued
fortunately
it
six
and
i
can
offer
you
gentlemen
a
cocktail
for
upon
my
word
i
need
it
come
to
look
at
you
ware
there
a
trifle
more
what
i
might
term
about
you
that
chap
on
the
boat
was
a
little
crude
in
places
but
believe
me
sir
he
went
on
thrusting
his
arm
through
ware
and
leading
him
towards
the
bar
you
do
want
to
be
annoyed
at
those
people
who
have
mistaken
you
for
romilly
for
in
the
whole
course
of
my
life
and
i
travelled
round
the
world
a
pretty
good
deal
i
never
came
across
a
likeness
so
entirely
extraordinary
i
have
heard
other
people
mention
it
noel
bridges
intervened
although
not
quite
with
the
same
conviction
as
you
greene
curiously
enough
however
the
photograph
of
romilly
which
they
sent
out
from
england
and
which
was
in
all
the
sunday
papers
did
strike
me
as
being
particularly
like
mr
ware
it
was
a
damned
bad
photograph
that
raymond
greene
pronounced
i
saw
it
could
make
head
nor
tail
of
it
myself
well
the
world
is
full
of
queer
surprises
but
this
is
the
queerest
i
ever
ran
up
against
believe
me
ware
if
this
man
romilly
who
disappeared
had
been
a
millionaire
you
could
have
walked
into
his
family
circle
and
been
made
welcome
at
the
present
moment
why
i
do
believe
his
own
wife
or
sister
if
he
had
such
appendages
would
have
been
able
to
tell
that
you
were
the
man
unfortunately
bridges
remarked
as
he
sipped
the
cocktail
which
the
cinema
man
had
ordered
this
chap
romilly
was
broke
was
he
did
a
scoot
to
avoid
the
they
say
that
he
had
a
few
hundred
thousand
dollars
over
here
ostensibly
for
buying
material
and
that
he
has
taken
the
lot
out
west
well
i
must
say
he
did
seem
that
sort
on
the
steamer
raymond
greene
declared
but
you
never
can
tell
looked
to
me
more
like
a
schoolteacher
some
day
ware
i
want
you
to
come
along
to
my
office
it
just
round
the
corner
in
broadway
there
and
have
a
chat
about
the
play
you
do
want
to
film
us
before
we
finished
its
first
run
surely
philip
protested
laughing
give
us
a
chance
well
we
talk
about
that
the
cinema
magnate
promised
they
were
joined
by
other
acquaintances
and
philip
presently
made
his
escape
one
of
the
moments
which
he
had
dreaded
more
than
any
other
had
come
and
passed
even
if
raymond
greene
had
still
some
slight
misgivings
he
was
to
all
effects
and
purposes
convinced
philip
walked
down
the
street
feeling
that
one
more
obstacle
in
the
path
of
his
absolute
freedom
had
been
torn
away
he
glanced
at
his
watch
and
boarded
a
car
descended
in
the
heart
of
the
city
region
of
broadway
and
threaded
his
way
through
several
streets
until
he
came
to
the
back
entrance
of
a
dry
goods
store
here
he
glanced
once
more
at
his
watch
and
commenced
slowly
to
walk
up
and
down
the
timekeeper
who
was
standing
in
the
doorway
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
watched
him
with
interest
when
philip
approached
for
the
third
time
he
addressed
him
in
friendly
fashion
waiting
for
one
of
our
gals
eh
philip
stifled
his
quick
annoyance
and
answered
in
as
a
tone
as
possible
yes
how
long
will
it
be
before
they
are
out
from
the
typewriting
department
typewriting
department
the
man
repeated
well
that
depends
some
upon
the
work
they
be
out
most
likely
in
ten
minutes
or
so
i
guessed
you
were
after
one
of
our
showroom
young
ladies
we
get
some
real
swells
down
here
sometimes
motor
cars
of
their
own
the
typists
ai
much
as
a
rule
it
a
skinny
job
theirs
the
young
ladies
from
here
appear
to
be
prosperous
ware
remarked
i
watched
them
last
night
coming
out
my
friend
happened
to
be
late
and
i
had
to
leave
without
seeing
her
that
nothing
to
go
by
their
clothes
ai
the
man
replied
they
spend
all
their
money
on
their
backs
instead
of
putting
it
inside
if
it
miss
grimes
you
waiting
for
you
in
luck
for
here
she
is
first
out
philip
drew
a
little
into
the
background
the
girl
came
down
the
stone
passage
passed
the
timekeeper
without
appearing
to
notice
his
familiar
and
stepped
out
into
the
murky
street
philip
who
saw
her
face
as
she
emerged
from
the
gloom
gave
a
little
start
she
seemed
paler
than
ever
and
she
walked
with
her
eyes
fixed
upon
vacancy
as
though
almost
unconscious
of
her
whereabouts
she
crossed
the
sidewalk
without
noticing
the
curbstone
and
stumbled
at
the
unexpected
depth
of
it
philip
stepped
hastily
forward
miss
grimes
he
exclaimed
martha
why
do
you
look
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
ghost
she
started
violently
it
was
certain
that
she
saw
him
then
for
the
first
time
you
ware
sorry
i
did
see
you
he
insisted
upon
shaking
hands
there
was
a
little
streak
of
colour
in
her
cheeks
now
i
came
to
meet
you
he
explained
i
came
yesterday
and
missed
you
i
have
been
to
your
rooms
four
times
and
only
found
out
with
difficulty
where
you
were
working
the
last
time
i
called
i
rang
the
bell
six
times
but
the
door
was
locked
i
was
in
bed
she
said
shortly
i
ca
have
gentlemen
callers
there
at
all
now
father
gone
off
on
tour
thank
you
for
coming
to
meet
me
but
i
do
think
you
better
stop
why
not
he
asked
gently
because
i
do
want
to
be
seen
about
with
you
she
declared
because
i
do
want
you
to
look
at
me
because
i
want
you
to
leave
me
alone
she
added
with
a
little
passionate
choke
in
her
voice
he
turned
and
walked
by
her
side
martha
he
said
you
were
very
kind
to
me
when
i
needed
it
you
were
a
companion
to
me
when
i
was
more
miserable
than
i
ever
thought
any
human
being
could
be
i
was
in
a
quandary
then
in
a
very
difficult
position
i
took
a
plunge
in
a
way
i
have
been
successful
oh
we
all
know
that
she
replied
bitterly
pictures
everywhere
notices
in
the
paper
all
the
time
you
and
your
fine
play
i
seen
it
did
think
much
of
it
myself
but
i
suppose
i
not
a
judge
tell
me
why
you
came
out
there
looking
as
though
you
seen
a
ghost
he
asked
discharged
she
answered
promptly
why
fainted
yesterday
she
went
on
and
was
a
bit
wobbly
the
head
clerk
said
he
wanted
some
one
stronger
brute
philip
muttered
well
that
all
right
martha
i
have
some
work
for
you
do
want
to
do
your
work
little
fool
he
exclaimed
martha
do
you
know
you
the
most
obstinate
prejudiced
little
beast
i
ever
knew
then
go
along
and
leave
me
she
insisted
stopping
short
if
i
all
that
you
also
a
dear
she
drew
a
little
breath
and
looked
at
him
fiercely
now
do
be
silly
he
begged
i
starving
i
had
no
lunch
so
that
i
could
dine
early
here
we
are
at
durrad
i
not
going
inside
there
with
you
she
declared
look
here
he
expostulated
are
we
going
to
do
a
wrestling
act
on
the
sidewalk
it
will
be
in
all
the
papers
you
know
spoil
your
clothes
some
would
it
she
remarked
looking
at
them
disparagingly
it
would
indeed
also
my
temper
he
assured
her
we
are
going
to
have
a
cocktail
you
and
i
within
two
minutes
young
lady
and
a
steak
afterwards
if
you
want
to
go
in
there
with
my
hand
on
your
neck
you
can
but
i
think
it
would
look
better
she
set
her
feet
squarely
upon
the
ground
and
faced
him
ware
she
said
i
am
in
rags
any
one
can
see
that
listen
i
will
not
go
into
a
restaurant
and
sit
by
your
side
to
have
people
wonder
what
woman
from
the
streets
you
have
brought
in
to
give
a
meal
to
out
of
charity
do
you
hear
that
i
can
live
or
i
can
die
just
by
myself
if
i
ca
keep
myself
i
die
but
i
wo
nothing
doing
you
hear
she
had
been
so
strong
and
then
something
in
his
eyes
that
pitying
half
anxious
expression
with
which
he
listened
suddenly
seemed
to
sap
her
determination
she
swayed
a
little
upon
her
feet
she
was
indeed
very
tired
and
very
weak
philip
took
instant
advantage
of
her
condition
without
a
moment
hesitation
he
passed
his
arm
firmly
through
hers
and
before
she
could
protest
she
was
inside
the
place
being
led
to
a
table
seated
there
with
her
back
to
the
wall
with
a
confused
tangle
of
words
still
in
her
throat
unuttered
then
two
great
tears
found
their
way
into
her
eyes
she
said
nothing
because
she
could
not
philip
was
busy
talking
to
the
waiter
soon
there
was
a
cocktail
by
her
side
and
he
was
drinking
smiling
at
her
perfectly
obviously
accepting
her
momentary
weakness
and
his
triumph
as
a
joke
got
you
in
did
i
he
observed
pleasantly
now
remember
you
told
me
the
way
to
drink
american
cocktails
one
look
one
swallow
and
down
they
go
she
obeyed
him
instinctively
then
she
took
out
a
miserable
little
piece
of
a
handkerchief
and
wiped
her
eyes
what
gone
wrong
he
asked
briskly
tell
me
all
about
it
father
went
off
on
tour
she
explained
he
left
the
rent
owing
for
a
month
and
he
been
writing
for
money
all
the
time
the
agent
who
comes
round
does
listen
to
excuses
you
pay
or
out
you
go
into
the
street
i
paid
somehow
and
nearly
starved
over
it
then
i
got
this
job
after
worrying
about
it
lord
knows
how
long
and
this
evening
i
discharged
how
much
a
week
was
it
he
enquired
with
sympathy
ten
dollars
she
replied
little
enough
but
i
ca
live
without
it
he
changed
his
attitude
suddenly
realising
the
volcanic
sensitiveness
of
her
attitude
towards
him
and
life
in
general
instinctively
he
felt
that
at
a
single
word
she
would
even
then
in
her
moment
of
weakness
have
left
him
have
pushed
him
on
one
side
and
walked
out
to
whatever
she
might
have
to
face
what
a
fool
you
are
he
exclaimed
a
little
brusquely
am
i
she
replied
belligerently
of
course
you
are
you
call
yourself
a
daughter
of
new
york
a
city
whose
motto
seems
to
be
pretty
well
every
one
for
himself
you
know
you
did
my
typing
all
right
you
know
my
play
was
a
success
you
know
that
i
shall
have
to
write
another
what
made
you
take
it
for
granted
that
i
should
want
to
employ
you
and
go
and
hide
yourself
lock
the
door
when
i
came
to
see
you
because
it
was
past
eight
and
not
answer
my
letters
ca
have
men
callers
now
dad
away
she
told
him
a
little
brusquely
it
not
allowed
oh
rubbish
he
answered
irritably
that
is
the
point
you
kept
away
from
me
you
deliberately
avoided
me
you
knew
that
i
was
just
as
lonely
as
you
were
then
she
blazed
out
the
sallowness
of
her
cheeks
the
little
dip
under
her
cheekbones
she
had
grown
thinner
during
the
last
week
or
so
made
her
eyes
seem
larger
and
more
brilliant
than
ever
you
lonely
rubbish
why
they
all
running
after
you
everywhere
quite
a
social
success
according
to
the
papers
i
say
ai
you
afraid
horribly
he
admitted
and
about
the
one
person
i
could
have
talked
to
about
it
chucks
me
i
do
know
anything
about
you
or
what
you
done
she
said
i
only
know
that
the
tecs
he
laid
his
hand
upon
her
fingers
she
snatched
them
away
but
accepted
his
warning
they
were
served
then
with
their
meal
and
their
conversation
drifted
into
other
channels
well
he
continued
presently
in
a
perfectly
tone
found
you
now
and
you
got
to
be
sensible
it
true
i
had
a
stroke
of
luck
but
that
might
fall
away
at
any
moment
i
typing
waiting
for
you
or
i
can
get
you
a
post
at
the
new
york
theatre
you
better
first
do
my
typing
i
have
it
in
your
rooms
morning
by
nine
and
would
you
like
something
in
advance
no
she
replied
grudgingly
i
have
what
i
earned
when
earned
it
he
sipped
his
claret
and
studied
her
meditatively
you
not
much
of
a
pal
are
you
she
scoffed
at
him
looked
him
up
and
down
at
his
clothes
his
general
air
of
prosperity
pal
she
jeered
look
at
you
merton
ware
the
great
dramatist
and
me
a
shabby
ugly
indifferent
typewriter
she
repeated
yes
i
am
that
i
did
start
out
to
be
i
just
had
any
luck
it
will
all
come
some
day
he
assured
her
cheerfully
i
think
if
you
stayed
different
she
went
on
thoughtfully
if
you
had
slipped
away
into
the
clouds
shows
what
a
selfish
little
beast
i
am
ca
imagine
why
you
bother
about
me
shall
i
tell
you
why
really
he
asked
because
you
saved
me
i
know
what
from
the
night
we
went
out
i
was
suffering
from
a
loneliness
which
was
the
worst
torture
i
have
ever
felt
it
was
there
in
my
throat
and
dragging
down
my
heart
and
i
just
felt
as
though
any
way
of
ending
it
all
would
be
a
joy
all
these
millions
of
people
intent
on
their
own
prosperity
or
their
own
petty
troubles
goaded
me
i
think
into
a
sort
of
silent
fury
just
that
one
night
i
craved
like
a
madman
for
a
single
human
being
to
talk
to
well
i
shall
never
forget
it
martha
miss
grimes
she
interrupted
under
her
breath
he
laughed
that
does
really
matter
does
it
he
asked
you
never
been
afraid
that
i
should
want
to
make
love
to
you
have
you
she
glanced
round
into
the
mirror
by
their
side
looked
at
her
wan
face
the
shabby
little
hat
the
none
too
tidily
arranged
hair
which
drooped
over
her
ears
down
at
her
shapeless
jacket
her
patched
skirt
the
shoes
which
were
in
open
rebellion
then
she
laughed
curiously
enough
without
any
note
of
bitterness
seems
queer
does
it
even
to
think
of
such
a
thing
i
been
up
against
it
pretty
hard
though
a
man
who
gives
a
meal
to
a
girl
even
if
she
is
as
plain
as
i
am
generally
seems
to
think
he
bought
her
in
this
city
even
the
men
who
are
earning
money
do
give
much
for
nothing
but
you
are
different
she
admitted
i
be
fair
about
it
you
different
you
be
waiting
for
the
work
at
nine
morning
he
asked
as
indifferently
as
possible
i
will
she
promised
he
leaned
back
and
told
her
little
anecdotes
about
the
play
things
that
had
happened
to
him
during
the
last
few
weeks
speaking
often
of
elizabeth
dalstan
by
degrees
the
nervous
unrest
seemed
to
pass
away
from
her
when
they
had
finished
their
meal
and
drunk
their
coffee
she
was
almost
normal
she
smoked
a
cigarette
and
even
accepted
the
box
which
he
thrust
into
her
hand
when
he
had
paid
the
bill
she
rose
a
little
abruptly
well
she
said
you
had
your
way
and
a
kind
nice
way
it
was
now
i
have
mine
i
do
want
any
politeness
when
we
leave
this
place
i
am
going
to
walk
home
and
i
am
going
to
walk
home
alone
that
lucky
he
replied
because
i
have
to
be
at
the
theatre
in
ten
minutes
to
meet
a
cinema
man
button
up
your
coat
and
have
a
good
sleep
they
left
the
place
together
she
turned
away
with
a
farewell
nod
and
walked
rapidly
eastwards
he
watched
her
cross
the
road
a
poor
little
waif
she
seemed
except
that
something
had
gone
from
her
face
which
had
almost
terrified
him
she
carried
herself
he
fancied
with
more
buoyancy
with
infinitely
more
confidence
and
he
drew
a
sigh
of
relief
as
he
called
for
a
taxi

paused
for
breath
at
the
top
of
the
third
flight
of
stairs
she
leaned
against
the
iron
balustrade
you
poor
dear
she
exclaimed
how
many
times
a
day
did
you
have
to
do
this
i
did
go
out
very
often
he
reminded
her
and
it
was
every
day
that
the
lift
was
out
of
order
it
only
one
more
flight
she
looked
up
the
stairs
sighed
and
raised
her
smart
grey
skirt
a
little
higher
over
her
shoes
well
she
announced
heroically
lead
on
if
they
would
sometimes
dust
these
steps
but
after
all
it
does
matter
to
you
now
does
it
fancy
that
poor
girl
though
he
smiled
a
little
grimly
a
few
flights
of
stairs
are
the
worst
things
she
has
had
to
face
afraid
he
said
i
am
rather
terrified
of
her
elizabeth
confided
supporting
herself
by
her
companion
shoulder
i
think
i
know
that
type
kick
me
if
i
put
my
foot
in
it
is
this
the
door
philip
nodded
and
knocked
softly
there
was
a
sharp
come
in
put
the
key
down
please
the
figure
at
the
typewriter
said
as
they
entered
the
words
had
scarcely
left
martha
lips
before
she
turned
around
conscious
of
some
other
influence
in
the
room
philip
stepped
forward
miss
grimes
he
said
i
have
brought
miss
dalstan
in
to
see
you
she
wants
he
paused
something
in
the
stony
expression
of
the
girl
who
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
stood
now
facing
them
her
ashen
paleness
unrelieved
by
any
note
of
colour
her
hands
hanging
in
front
of
her
patched
and
shabby
frock
seemed
to
check
the
words
upon
his
lips
her
voice
was
low
but
not
soft
it
seemed
to
create
at
once
an
atmosphere
of
anger
and
resentment
what
do
you
want
she
demanded
i
hope
you
do
mind
i
am
so
anxious
that
you
should
do
some
work
for
me
elizabeth
explained
when
ware
first
brought
me
in
his
play
i
noticed
how
nicely
it
was
typewritten
you
must
have
been
glad
to
find
it
turn
out
such
a
success
i
take
no
interest
in
my
work
when
once
it
is
typed
martha
grimes
declared
and
i
am
very
sorry
but
i
do
not
like
to
receive
visitors
i
am
very
busy
ware
knows
quite
well
that
i
like
to
be
left
alone
elizabeth
smiled
at
her
delightfully
but
it
is
always
good
for
us
is
it
she
reminded
her
to
live
exactly
as
we
would
like
or
to
have
our
own
way
in
all
things
there
was
a
moment
rather
queer
silence
martha
grimes
seemed
to
be
intent
upon
studying
the
appearance
of
her
visitor
the
very
beautiful
woman
familiar
to
nearly
every
one
in
new
york
perhaps
at
that
moment
america
most
popular
actress
her
eyes
seemed
to
dwell
upon
the
little
strands
of
fair
hair
that
escaped
from
beneath
her
smart
but
simple
hat
to
take
in
the
slightly
deprecating
lift
of
the
eyebrows
the
very
attractive
half
appealing
smile
the
smart
grey
gown
with
the
bunch
of
violets
in
her
waistband
elizabeth
was
as
quietly
dressed
as
it
was
possible
for
her
to
be
but
her
appearance
nevertheless
brought
a
note
of
some
other
world
into
the
shabby
little
apartment
it
the
only
thing
i
ask
of
life
martha
said
the
only
thing
i
get
i
want
to
be
left
alone
and
i
will
be
left
alone
if
there
is
any
more
work
i
will
do
it
if
there
is
i
can
find
some
somewhere
else
but
visitors
i
do
want
and
wo
have
elizabeth
was
adorably
patient
she
surreptitiously
drew
towards
her
a
cane
chair
a
article
of
furniture
upon
which
she
seated
herself
slowly
and
with
great
care
well
she
continued
with
unabated
pleasantness
that
is
reasonable
as
far
as
it
goes
only
we
did
quite
understand
and
it
is
such
a
climb
up
here
is
it
i
came
to
talk
about
some
work
but
i
must
get
my
breath
first
miss
dalstan
thought
perhaps
philip
intervened
diffidently
that
you
might
consider
accepting
a
post
at
the
theatre
they
always
keep
two
stenographers
there
and
one
of
them
fills
up
her
time
by
private
work
generally
work
for
some
one
connected
with
the
theatre
in
your
case
you
could
of
course
go
on
with
mine
only
when
i
had
enough
for
you
and
of
course
i
ca
compose
as
fast
as
you
can
type
there
would
be
something
else
and
the
salary
would
be
regular
i
should
like
a
regular
post
the
girl
admitted
sullenly
so
would
any
one
who
out
of
work
of
course
the
salary
elizabeth
explained
is
dollars
a
week
the
hours
are
nine
to
six
you
have
quite
a
comfortable
room
there
but
when
you
have
private
work
connected
with
the
theatre
you
can
bring
it
home
if
you
wish
ware
tells
me
that
you
work
very
quickly
you
will
finish
all
that
you
have
for
him
wo
you
i
shall
have
it
finished
in
half
an
hour
then
will
you
be
at
the
new
york
theatre
morning
at
nine
elizabeth
suggested
there
are
some
parts
to
be
copied
it
will
be
very
nice
indeed
if
you
like
the
work
and
i
think
you
will
the
girl
stood
there
irresolute
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
trying
to
bring
herself
to
utter
some
form
of
thanks
then
there
was
a
loud
knock
at
the
door
which
was
opened
without
waiting
for
any
reply
the
janitor
stood
there
with
a
small
key
in
his
hand
which
he
threw
down
upon
a
table
key
of
number
two
hundred
miss
he
said
let
me
have
it
back
again
he
closed
the
door
and
departed
two
hundred
philip
exclaimed
why
that
my
old
room
the
one
up
above
i
must
see
it
elizabeth
insisted
do
please
let
us
go
up
there
i
meant
to
ask
you
to
show
it
me
you
are
not
thinking
of
moving
are
you
miss
grimes
philip
enquired
she
snatched
at
the
key
but
he
had
just
possessed
himself
of
it
and
was
swinging
it
from
his
forefinger
i
do
know
she
snapped
i
was
going
up
there
anyway
you
have
the
key
why
not
philip
asked
in
surprise
never
mind
there
are
some
things
of
mine
up
there
i
she
broke
off
they
both
looked
at
her
perplexed
philip
shook
his
head
miss
grimes
he
said
you
forget
that
the
rooms
are
mine
till
next
quarter
day
i
promise
you
we
will
respect
any
of
your
belongings
we
may
find
there
come
along
elizabeth
we
see
you
as
we
come
down
the
latter
promised
nodding
pleasantly
i
do
know
as
you
will
the
girl
retorted
fiercely
i
may
not
be
here
they
climbed
the
last
two
flights
of
stairs
together
what
an
extraordinary
young
woman
elizabeth
exclaimed
is
there
any
reason
for
her
being
quite
so
rude
to
me
none
that
i
can
conceive
he
answered
she
is
always
like
that
and
yet
you
took
an
interest
in
her
why
not
she
is
human
soured
by
misfortune
if
you
like
with
an
immense
stock
of
bravery
and
honesty
underneath
it
all
she
has
had
a
drunken
father
practically
upon
her
hands
and
life
been
pretty
sordid
for
her
here
we
are
he
fitted
the
key
into
the
lock
and
swung
the
door
open
the
clear
afternoon
light
shone
in
upon
the
little
shabby
room
and
its
worn
furniture
there
were
one
or
two
insignificant
belongings
of
still
lying
about
the
place
and
on
the
exactly
opposite
the
spot
where
he
used
to
sit
a
little
blue
vase
in
which
was
a
bunch
of
violets
somehow
or
other
it
was
the
one
arresting
object
in
the
room
they
both
of
them
looked
at
it
in
equal
amazement
is
any
one
living
here
elizabeth
enquired
not
to
my
knowledge
he
replied
no
one
could
take
it
on
without
my
signing
a
release
they
moved
over
to
the
desk
elizabeth
stooped
down
and
smelt
the
violets
lifted
them
up
and
looked
at
the
cut
stalks
is
this
where
you
used
to
sit
and
write
she
asked
he
nodded
but
i
never
had
any
flowers
here
he
observed
gazing
at
them
in
a
puzzled
manner
elizabeth
looked
at
the
vase
and
set
it
down
then
she
turned
towards
her
companion
and
shook
her
head
oh
my
dear
philip
she
sighed
you
really
do
know
what
makes
that
girl
so
uncouth
you
mean
martha
of
course
i
do
you
think
that
she
rubbish
he
stopped
short
in
sudden
confusion
elizabeth
passed
her
arm
through
his
she
replaced
the
vase
very
carefully
looked
once
more
around
the
room
and
led
him
to
the
door
never
mind
she
said
it
is
anything
serious
of
course
but
wonderful
philip
what
memories
a
really
lonely
woman
will
live
on
what
she
will
do
to
keep
that
little
natural
vein
of
sentiment
alive
in
her
and
how
fiercely
she
will
fight
to
conceal
it
you
can
go
on
down
and
wait
for
me
in
the
hall
i
am
going
in
to
say
to
miss
martha
grimes
i
think
that
this
time
i
shall
get
on
better
with
her
chapter
v
philip
waited
nearly
a
quarter
of
an
hour
for
elizabeth
when
at
last
she
returned
she
was
unusually
silent
they
drove
off
together
in
her
automobile
she
held
his
fingers
under
the
rug
philip
dear
she
said
i
think
it
is
time
that
you
and
i
were
married
he
turned
and
looked
at
her
in
amazement
there
was
a
smile
upon
her
lips
but
rather
a
plaintive
one
he
had
a
fancy
somehow
that
there
had
been
tears
in
her
eyes
lately
elizabeth
if
we
are
ever
going
to
be
she
went
on
softly
why
should
we
be
married
quietly
as
people
are
sometimes
and
then
tell
every
one
afterwards
he
held
the
joy
away
from
him
struggling
hard
for
composure
but
a
little
time
ago
he
reminded
her
you
wanted
to
wait
yes
she
confessed
i
too
had
my
my
what
shall
i
call
it
fear
my
ghost
in
the
background
ah
but
not
like
mine
he
faltered
his
voice
unsteady
with
a
surging
flood
of
passion
elizabeth
if
you
really
mean
it
if
you
are
going
to
take
the
risk
of
finding
yourself
the
wife
of
the
villain
in
a
why
why
you
know
very
well
that
even
the
thought
of
it
can
draw
me
up
into
heaven
but
dear
my
sweetheart
remember
we
played
a
bold
game
or
rather
i
have
with
your
encouragement
but
we
not
safe
yet
do
you
know
anything
that
i
do
she
asked
feverishly
well
i
suppose
i
do
he
admitted
it
is
necessarily
serious
he
went
on
quickly
as
he
saw
the
colour
fade
from
her
cheeks
but
on
the
very
night
that
our
play
was
produced
whilst
i
was
waiting
about
for
you
all
at
the
restaurant
a
man
came
to
see
me
he
is
one
of
the
keenest
detectives
in
new
york
edward
dane
his
name
is
he
knew
perfectly
well
that
i
was
the
man
who
had
disappeared
from
the
waldorf
he
told
me
so
to
my
face
then
why
did
he
why
did
he
do
something
because
he
was
clever
enough
to
suspect
that
there
was
something
else
behind
it
all
philip
said
grimly
you
see
he
discovered
that
i
had
used
any
of
the
money
he
could
fit
in
any
of
my
doings
with
the
reports
they
had
about
douglas
somehow
or
other
i
ca
tell
how
another
suspicion
seems
to
have
crept
into
the
man
brain
all
the
time
he
talked
to
me
i
could
see
him
trying
to
read
in
my
face
whether
there
was
something
else
he
stumbled
across
a
puzzle
of
which
the
pieces
did
fit
he
has
gone
to
england
gone
to
detton
magna
gone
to
see
whether
there
are
any
missing
pieces
to
be
found
he
may
be
back
any
day
now
but
what
could
he
discover
she
faltered
god
knows
philip
groaned
there
the
whole
ghastly
truth
there
if
fortune
helped
him
and
he
were
clever
enough
if
by
any
devilish
chance
the
threads
came
into
his
hand
i
do
think
i
do
think
there
was
ever
any
fear
from
the
other
side
i
had
all
the
luck
but
elizabeth
sometimes
i
am
terrified
of
this
man
dane
i
did
mean
to
tell
you
this
but
it
too
late
now
do
you
know
that
i
am
watched
day
by
day
i
pretend
not
to
notice
it
i
am
even
able
now
and
then
to
shut
it
out
from
my
own
thoughts
but
wherever
i
go
there
some
one
shadowing
me
some
one
walking
in
my
footsteps
i
perfectly
certain
that
if
you
were
to
go
to
police
headquarters
here
you
could
find
out
where
i
have
spent
almost
every
hour
since
i
took
that
room
in
monmouth
house
she
gripped
his
fingers
fiercely
philip
philip
he
leaned
forward
gazing
with
peculiar
almost
passionate
intentness
into
the
faces
of
the
people
as
they
swept
along
broadway
look
at
them
elizabeth
he
muttered
look
at
that
mob
of
men
and
women
sweeping
along
the
pavements
there
every
kind
and
shape
of
man
every
nationality
every
age
they
are
like
the
little
flecks
on
the
top
of
a
wave
i
watched
them
when
i
first
came
and
i
felt
almost
reckless
you
think
a
man
could
plunge
in
there
and
be
lost
would
you
he
ca
i
tried
it
is
there
anywhere
else
in
the
world
i
wonder
is
there
anywhere
in
the
living
world
where
one
can
throw
off
everything
of
the
past
where
one
can
take
up
a
new
life
and
memory
does
come
she
shook
her
head
she
was
more
composed
now
the
moment
of
feverish
excitement
had
passed
her
shrewd
and
level
common
sense
had
begun
to
reassert
itself
there
is
any
such
place
philip
she
told
him
and
if
there
were
it
would
be
worth
while
your
trying
to
find
it
we
are
both
a
little
hysterical
this
evening
we
lost
our
sense
of
proportion
played
for
your
stake
you
must
quail
if
the
worst
should
come
you
must
brave
it
out
i
believe
even
then
you
would
be
safe
but
it
come
it
sha
he
gripped
her
hands
they
were
slowing
up
now
caught
in
a
maze
of
heavy
traffic
a
few
blocks
from
the
theatre
his
voice
was
firm
he
had
regained
his
what
an
idiot
i
have
been
he
exclaimed
scornfully
never
mind
past
there
is
just
one
more
serious
word
though
dear
she
responded
immediately
to
the
change
in
his
manner
and
smiled
into
his
face
well
my
only
real
problem
he
went
on
earnestly
is
this
dare
i
hold
you
to
your
word
elizabeth
dare
i
for
instance
say
to
the
wonderful
suggestion
of
yours
make
you
my
wife
and
risk
having
people
look
at
you
in
years
to
come
point
at
you
with
pity
and
say
that
you
married
a
murderer
who
died
a
shameful
death
fancy
how
the
tragedy
of
that
would
lie
across
your
life
you
who
are
so
wonderful
and
so
courted
and
so
clever
is
that
my
affair
philip
she
asked
calmly
no
he
answered
it
mine
she
turned
and
laughed
at
him
for
a
moment
she
was
her
old
self
again
you
refuse
me
his
eyes
glowed
we
wait
he
said
hoarsely
till
dane
comes
back
from
england
the
car
had
stopped
outside
the
theatre
hat
in
hand
and
with
his
face
wreathed
in
smiles
the
commissionaire
had
thrown
open
the
door
the
people
on
the
pavement
were
nudging
one
another
a
famous
woman
was
about
to
descend
she
turned
back
to
philip
come
in
with
me
she
begged
somehow
i
feel
cold
and
lonely
it
has
anything
to
do
with
what
we
were
talking
about
but
i
feel
as
though
something
were
going
to
happen
that
something
were
coming
out
of
the
shadows
something
that
threatens
either
you
or
me
i
silly
but
come
she
clung
to
him
as
they
crossed
the
pavement
for
once
she
forgot
to
smile
at
the
little
curious
crowd
she
was
absorbed
in
herself
and
her
feelings
life
is
so
hard
sometimes
she
exclaimed
as
they
lingered
for
a
moment
near
the
box
office
there
that
poor
girl
philip
friendless
and
lonely
what
she
must
suffer

sick
with
loneliness

i
do

go
a
step
alone
i
do
want
to
be
alone
for
a
moment
he
laughed
reassuringly
and
drew
her
closer
to
him
she
led
the
way
down
the
passage
towards
her
own
suite
of
apartments
they
passed
one
or
two
of
the
officials
of
the
theatre
whom
she
greeted
with
something
less
than
her
usual
charm
of
manner
as
they
reached
the
manager
office
there
was
the
sound
of
loud
voices
and
the
door
was
thrown
open
fink
appeared
and
with
him
a
somewhat
remarkable
figure
a
tall
immensely
broad
man
with
a
strong
rugged
face
and
a
mass
of
grey
hair
a
huge
man
who
seemed
somehow
or
other
to
proclaim
himself
of
a
bigger
and
stronger
type
than
those
others
amongst
whom
he
moved
he
had
black
eyes
and
the
heavy
jaw
of
an
irishman
his
face
was
curiously
unwrinkled
he
stood
there
blocking
the
way
his
great
hands
suddenly
thrust
forward
betty
by
the
lord
that
loves
us
he
exclaimed
here
luck
i
was
on
my
way
out
to
search
for
you
got
here
on
the
chicago
limited
at
four
give
me
your
hands
and
say
that
you
are
glad
to
see
me
if
elizabeth
were
glad
she
showed
no
sign
of
it
she
seemed
to
have
become
rooted
to
the
spot
suddenly
dumb
philip
by
her
side
heard
the
quick
indrawing
of
her
breath
sylvanus
she
murmured
you
why
i
thought
you
were
in
china
there
no
place
on
god
earth
can
hold
me
for
long
was
the
boisterous
reply
i
did
my
business
there
in
three
days
and
caught
a
japanese
boat
back
such
a
voyage
and
such
food
but
new
york
will
make
up
for
that
you
got
a
great
play
they
tell
me
i
must
hear
all
about
it
shake
my
hands
first
though
girl
as
though
you
were
glad
to
see
me
you
seem
to
have
shrunken
since
i
saw
you
last
to
have
grown
smaller
did
london
agree
with
you
the
moment
of
shock
had
passed
elizabeth
had
recovered
herself
she
gave
the
newcomer
her
hands
quite
frankly
she
even
seemed
in
a
measure
glad
to
see
him
these
unannounced
comings
and
goings
of
yours
from
the
ends
of
the
earth
are
so
upsetting
to
your
friends
she
declared
and
this
gentleman
who
is
he
elizabeth
laughed
softly
i
need
tell
you
ware
she
said
turning
to
philip
that
this
dear
man
here
is
an
eccentric
i
dare
say
you
heard
of
him
it
is
sylvanus
power
and
sylvanus
this
is
merton
ware
the
author
of
our
play
house
of
shams
philip
felt
his
hand
held
in
a
grasp
which
firm
though
it
was
seemed
to
owe
its
vigour
rather
to
the
long
powerful
fingers
than
to
any
real
cordiality
sylvanus
power
was
studying
him
from
behind
his
bushy
eyebrows
so
you
merton
ware
he
observed
i
have
seen
your
play
yet
hope
to
an
englishman
eh
yes
i
am
english
philip
assented
coolly
you
come
from
the
west
do
you
there
was
a
moment
silence
elizabeth
laughed
softly
oh
there
no
mistake
about
mr
power
she
declared
he
brings
the
breezy
west
with
him
to
wall
street
or
broadway
paris
or
london
you
ca
shake
it
off
or
blow
it
away
and
i
do
know
as
i
am
particularly
anxious
to
either
power
pronounced
are
you
going
to
your
rooms
here
betty
if
so
i
come
along
i
guess
ware
will
excuse
you
philip
was
instantly
conscious
of
the
antagonism
in
the
other
manner
as
yet
however
he
felt
little
more
than
amusement
he
glanced
towards
elizabeth
and
the
look
in
her
face
startled
him
the
colour
had
once
more
left
her
cheeks
and
her
eyes
were
full
of
appeal
if
you
would
mind
she
begged
power
is
a
very
old
friend
and
we
have
met
for
so
long
you
need
expect
to
see
anything
more
of
miss
dalstan
either
of
you
the
newcomer
declared
drawing
her
hand
through
his
arm
except
on
the
stage
that
is
i
am
going
to
take
her
out
and
give
her
a
little
dinner
directly
au
revoir
fink
i
see
you
here
to
you
mr
ware
philip
stood
for
a
moment
motionless
the
voice
of
sylvanus
power
was
no
small
thing
and
he
was
conscious
that
several
of
the
officials
of
the
place
and
the
man
in
the
box
office
had
heard
every
word
that
had
passed
he
felt
somehow
curiously
ignored
he
watched
the
huge
figure
of
the
westerner
with
elizabeth
by
his
side
disappear
down
the
corridor
fink
who
had
also
been
looking
after
them
turned
towards
him
say
that
some
man
sylvanus
power
he
exclaimed
admiringly
he
is
one
of
our
multimillionaires
ware
what
do
you
think
of
him
so
far
as
one
can
judge
from
a
few
seconds
conversation
philip
remarked
he
seems
to
possess
all
the
qualities
essential
to
the
production
of
a
multimillionaire
in
this
country
fink
grinned
sounds
a
trifle
sarcastic
but
i
guess
he
a
new
type
to
you
he
observed
tolerantly
absolutely
philip
acknowledged
as
he
turned
and
made
his
way
slowly
out
of
the
theatre
chapter
vi
philip
disposition
had
been
so
curiously
affected
by
the
emotions
of
the
last
few
months
that
he
was
not
in
the
least
surprised
to
find
himself
that
evening
torn
by
a
very
curious
and
unfamiliar
spasm
of
jealousy
after
an
hour
or
so
of
indecision
he
made
his
way
as
usual
to
the
theatre
but
instead
of
going
at
once
to
elizabeth
room
he
slipped
in
at
the
back
of
the
stalls
the
house
was
crowded
and
seated
in
the
stage
box
alone
and
gloomy
his
somewhat
austere
demeanour
intensified
by
the
severity
of
his
evening
clothes
sat
sylvanus
power
with
the
air
of
a
conqueror
philip
unaccountably
restless
left
his
seat
in
a
very
few
minutes
and
making
his
way
to
the
box
office
scribbled
a
line
to
elizabeth
the
official
to
whom
he
handed
it
looked
at
him
in
surprise
wo
you
go
round
yourself
mr
ware
he
suggested
miss
dalstan
has
another
ten
minutes
before
she
is
on
philip
shook
his
head
i
looking
for
a
man
i
know
he
replied
evasively
i
be
somewhere
about
here
in
five
minutes
the
answer
came
in
less
than
that
time
it
was
just
a
scrawled
line
in
pencil
forgive
me
dear
i
will
explain
everything
in
the
morning
if
you
will
come
to
my
rooms
at
eleven
this
evening
i
have
a
hateful
duty
to
perform
and
i
can
not
see
you
philip
impatient
of
the
atmosphere
of
the
theatre
wandered
out
into
the
streets
with
the
note
in
his
pocket
broadway
was
thronged
with
people
a
heterogeneous
throng
the
hardest
crowd
to
apprehend
to
understand
of
any
in
the
world
he
looked
absently
into
the
varying
stream
of
faces
stared
at
the
whirling
the
lights
flashing
from
the
tall
buildings
heard
snatches
of
the
music
from
the
open
doors
of
the
cafes
and
restaurants
men
and
even
women
elbowed
him
unresenting
out
of
the
way
without
the
semblance
of
an
apology
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
presence
there
part
of
the
drifting
pandemonium
of
the
pavement
was
in
a
sense
typical
of
his
own
existence
in
new
york
he
had
given
so
much
of
his
life
into
another
hands
and
now
the
anchor
was
dragging
he
was
suddenly
confronted
with
the
possibility
of
a
rift
in
his
relations
with
elizabeth
with
a
sudden
surging
doubt
not
of
elizabeth
herself
but
simply
a
feeling
of
insecurity
with
regard
to
their
future
he
only
realised
in
those
moments
how
much
he
had
leaned
upon
her
how
completely
she
seemed
to
have
extended
over
him
and
his
troubled
life
some
sort
of
sheltering
influence
to
which
he
had
succumbed
with
an
effortless
an
almost
fatalistic
impulse
finding
there
at
any
rate
a
refuge
from
the
horrors
of
his
empty
days
it
was
all
abstract
and
impersonal
at
first
this
jealousy
which
had
come
so
suddenly
to
disturb
the
serenity
of
an
almost
too
perfect
day
but
as
the
hours
passed
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
thoughts
dwelt
more
often
upon
the
direct
cause
of
his
brief
separation
from
elizabeth
he
turned
in
at
one
of
the
clubs
of
which
he
had
been
made
a
member
and
threw
himself
gloomily
into
an
his
thoughts
had
turned
towards
the
grim
masterful
personality
of
the
man
who
seemed
to
have
obtruded
himself
upon
their
lives
what
did
it
mean
when
elizabeth
told
him
she
was
engaged
for
she
was
supping
with
him
somewhere
probably
at
that
moment
seated
opposite
to
him
at
a
small
table
in
one
of
the
many
restaurants
of
the
city
which
they
had
visited
together
he
sylvanus
power
his
supplanter
was
occupying
the
place
that
belonged
to
him
ordering
her
supper
humouring
her
little
preferences
perhaps
sharing
with
her
that
little
glow
of
relief
which
comes
with
the
hour
of
rest
after
the
strain
of
the
day
work
the
suggestion
was
intolerable
he
would
have
an
explanation
elizabeth
belonged
to
him
the
sooner
the
world
knew
it
the
better
and
this
man
first
of
all
he
read
her
few
lines
again
hastily
pencilled
and
evidently
written
standing
up
there
was
a
certain
ignominy
in
being
sent
about
his
business
just
because
this
colossus
from
the
west
had
appeared
and
claimed
what
not
his
right
he
could
have
no
right
what
then
philip
ordered
a
drink
tore
open
an
evening
paper
and
tried
to
read
the
letters
danced
before
his
eyes
the
whisky
and
soda
stood
neglected
at
his
elbow
afterwards
he
found
himself
looking
into
space
there
was
something
cynical
challenging
almost
in
the
manner
in
which
that
man
had
taken
elizabeth
away
from
him
had
acknowledged
his
introduction
even
had
treated
the
author
of
a
play
a
writer
as
some
sort
of
a
mountebank
making
his
living
by
catering
for
the
amusements
of
the
world
how
did
that
man
regard
such
gifts
as
his
he
wondered
sylvanus
power
of
whom
he
had
seen
it
written
that
he
was
one
of
the
conquerors
of
nature
a
hard
but
splendid
utilitarian
the
builder
of
railways
in
china
and
bridges
for
the
transit
of
his
metals
amid
the
clouds
of
the
mountain
tops
in
the
man
absence
his
harshness
almost
uncouthness
seemed
modified
he
was
a
rival
without
a
doubt
and
a
favoured
one
how
well
had
he
known
elizabeth
for
how
long
was
it
true
that
rumour
he
had
once
heard
that
the
first
step
in
her
fortunes
had
been
due
to
the
caprice
of
a
millionaire
he
found
the
room
stifling
but
the
thought
of
the
streets
outside
unnerved
him
he
looked
about
for
some
distraction
the
room
was
beginning
to
fill
actors
musicians
a
few
journalists
a
great
many
men
of
note
in
the
world
of
bohemia
kept
streaming
in
one
or
two
of
them
nodded
to
him
several
paused
to
speak
hullo
ware
noel
bridges
exclaimed
not
often
you
give
us
a
look
in
what
are
you
doing
with
yourself
here
all
alone
philip
turned
to
answer
him
and
suddenly
felt
the
fire
blaze
up
again
he
saw
his
questioner
frown
saw
him
even
bite
his
lip
as
though
conscious
of
having
said
a
tactless
thing
the
actor
probably
understood
the
whole
situation
well
enough
i
generally
go
into
the
lotus
philip
lied
i
had
a
fancy
to
come
here
the
lotus
is
too
far
up
town
for
us
fellows
bridges
remarked
we
need
a
drink
a
little
supper
and
to
see
our
pals
quickly
when
the
work
is
over
i
hear
great
things
of
the
new
play
ware
but
i
know
when
you
get
a
chance
to
produce
it
were
you
in
the
house
tonight
only
for
a
moment
going
stronger
than
ever
bridges
continued
impressively
yes
thanks
i
take
a
scotch
highball
he
added
in
response
to
philip
mute
invitation
plenty
of
ice
mick
there
was
a
seat
to
be
had
in
the
house
and
i
would
like
to
say
what
old
fink
had
to
go
through
before
he
could
get
his
box
for
the
great
sylvanus
his
box
philip
queried
the
theatre
belongs
to
sylvanus
power
you
know
bridges
explained
he
built
it
five
years
ago
for
a
speculation
the
actor
fidgeted
for
a
moment
with
his
tumbler
no
for
miss
dalstan
he
replied
philip
set
his
teeth
hard
the
temptation
to
pursue
the
conversation
was
almost
overpowering
the
young
man
himself
though
a
trifle
embarrassed
seemed
perfectly
willing
to
talk
at
least
it
was
better
to
know
the
truth
then
another
impulse
suddenly
asserted
itself
whatever
he
was
to
know
he
must
learn
from
her
lips
and
from
hers
only
well
i
should
think
it
turned
out
all
right
he
remarked
noel
bridges
shrugged
his
shoulders
the
rent
if
it
were
figured
out
at
a
fair
interest
on
the
capital
would
be
something
fabulous
he
declared
you
see
the
place
was
extravagantly
built
without
any
regard
to
cost
the
dressing
rooms
as
you
may
have
noticed
are
wonderful
and
all
the
appointments
are
unique
i
do
fancy
the
old
man
ever
had
a
quarter
rent
yet
that
paid
him
one
per
cent
on
the
money
see
you
later
perhaps
ware
the
young
man
concluded
setting
down
his
tumbler
i
going
in
to
have
a
grill
why
do
you
come
along
philip
hesitated
for
a
second
and
then
somewhat
to
the
other
surprise
assented
he
was
conscious
that
he
had
been
perhaps
just
a
little
unresponsive
to
the
many
courtesies
which
had
been
offered
him
here
and
at
the
other
kindred
clubs
they
had
been
ready
to
receive
him
with
open
arms
this
little
fraternity
of
and
his
response
had
been
perhaps
a
little
doubtful
not
from
any
lack
of
appreciation
but
partly
from
that
curious
diffidence
so
hard
to
understand
but
so
fundamentally
english
and
partly
because
of
that
queer
sense
of
being
an
impostor
which
sometimes
swept
over
him
a
sense
that
he
was
after
all
only
the
ghost
of
another
man
living
a
subjective
life
that
reason
it
out
however
he
might
there
was
something
of
the
fraud
in
any
personality
he
might
adopt
and
yet
deep
down
in
his
heart
he
was
conscious
of
so
earnest
a
desire
to
be
really
one
of
them
this
little
throng
with
their
delightful
intimacies
their
keen
interest
in
each
other
welfare
their
potent
almost
mysterious
geniality
which
seemed
to
draw
the
stranger
of
kindred
tastes
so
closely
under
its
influence
philip
as
he
sat
at
the
long
table
with
a
dozen
or
so
other
men
did
his
best
that
night
to
break
through
the
fetters
tried
hard
to
remember
that
his
place
amongst
them
after
all
was
honest
enough
they
were
writers
and
actors
and
journalists
well
he
too
was
a
writer
he
had
written
a
play
which
they
had
welcomed
with
open
arms
as
they
had
done
him
in
this
world
of
bohemia
if
anywhere
he
surely
had
a
right
to
lift
up
his
head
and
breathe
and
he
would
do
it
he
sat
with
them
smoking
and
talking
until
the
little
company
began
to
thin
out
establishing
all
the
time
a
new
reputation
doing
a
great
deal
to
dissipate
that
little
sense
of
disappointment
which
his
former
had
created
he
a
damned
good
fellow
after
all
one
of
them
declared
as
at
last
he
left
the
room
he
is
losing
his
britishness
every
day
he
stays
here
been
through
rough
times
they
say
another
remarked
he
is
one
of
those
an
elder
member
pronounced
taking
his
pipe
for
a
moment
from
his
mouth
who
was
never
made
for
happiness
you
can
always
read
those
men
you
can
see
it
behind
their
eyes
nevertheless
philip
walked
home
a
saner
and
a
better
man
he
felt
somehow
warmed
by
those
few
hours
of
companionship
the
senseless
part
of
his
jealousy
was
gone
his
trust
in
elizabeth
reestablished
he
looked
at
the
note
once
more
as
he
undressed
at
eleven
on
the
following
morning
in
her
rooms
chapter
vii
something
of
his
overnight
optimism
remained
with
philip
when
at
eleven
on
the
following
morning
he
was
ushered
into
elizabeth
rooms
it
was
a
frame
of
mind
however
which
did
not
long
survive
his
reception
from
the
moment
of
his
arrival
he
seemed
to
detect
a
different
atmosphere
in
his
surroundings
the
demeanour
of
phoebe
his
staunch
ally
who
admitted
him
without
her
usual
welcoming
smile
the
unanalysable
sense
of
something
wanting
in
the
dainty
little
room
overfilled
with
hothouse
flowers
in
the
entrance
and
welcome
of
elizabeth
herself
his
eyes
had
ached
for
the
sight
of
her
he
was
so
sure
that
he
would
know
everything
the
moment
she
spoke
yet
her
coming
brought
only
confusion
to
his
senses
she
was
different
unexpectedly
bewilderingly
different
she
had
lost
that
delicate
serenity
of
manner
that
almost
protective
affection
which
he
had
grown
to
lean
upon
and
expect
she
entered
dressed
for
the
street
smoking
a
cigarette
which
was
in
itself
unusual
with
dark
rings
under
her
eyes
which
seemed
to
be
looking
all
around
the
room
on
some
pretext
or
other
but
never
at
him
am
i
late
she
asked
a
little
breathlessly
i
am
so
sorry
tell
me
have
you
anything
particular
to
do
nothing
he
answered
i
want
to
go
out
of
the
city
into
the
country
at
once
she
told
him
feverishly
the
car
is
waiting
i
ordered
it
for
a
quarter
to
eleven
let
us
start
of
course
if
you
wish
it
he
assented
he
opened
the
door
but
before
she
passed
through
he
leaned
towards
her
she
shook
her
head
his
heart
sank
what
could
there
be
more
ominous
than
this
i
am
not
well
she
muttered
do
take
any
notice
of
anything
i
say
or
do
for
a
little
time
i
am
like
this
sometimes
temperamental
i
suppose
all
great
actresses
are
temperamental
i
suppose
i
am
a
great
actress
do
you
think
i
am
philip
he
was
following
her
now
he
found
it
hard
however
to
imitate
the
flippancy
of
her
tone
the
critics
insist
upon
it
he
observed
drily
evidently
your
audience
last
night
shared
their
opinion
she
nodded
i
love
them
to
applaud
like
that
and
yet
audiences
do
really
know
do
they
perhaps
she
relapsed
into
silence
and
they
took
their
places
in
the
car
she
settled
herself
down
with
a
little
sigh
of
content
and
drew
the
rug
over
her
as
far
as
you
can
go
john
she
told
the
man
but
you
must
get
back
at
six
the
country
mind
not
the
shore
they
started
off
so
you
were
there
last
night
she
murmured
leaning
back
amongst
the
cushions
with
an
air
of
relief
i
was
there
for
a
few
moments
i
wrote
my
note
to
you
in
the
box
office
she
shook
the
memory
away
and
afterwards
i
went
to
one
of
the
clubs
what
did
you
do
there
she
enquired
gossip
some
of
the
men
were
very
kind
to
me
he
said
i
had
supper
with
noel
bridges
amongst
others
well
she
asked
almost
defiantly
i
do
understand
she
looked
intently
at
him
for
a
moment
i
forgot
she
went
on
you
are
very
chivalrous
are
you
you
would
ask
questions
see
i
am
going
to
close
my
eyes
it
is
too
horrible
here
and
all
through
brooklyn
when
we
are
in
the
lanes
i
can
talk
this
is
just
one
of
those
days
i
wish
that
we
were
in
england
all
our
country
is
either
suburban
or
too
wild
and
restless
can
you
be
content
with
silence
for
a
little
time
of
course
he
assured
her
besides
you
forget
that
i
am
in
a
strange
country
everything
is
worth
watching
they
passed
over
brooklyn
bridge
and
for
an
hour
or
more
they
made
slow
progress
through
the
environs
of
the
city
at
last
however
the
endless
succession
of
factories
and
small
tenement
dwellings
lay
behind
them
they
passed
houses
with
real
gardens
through
stretches
of
wood
whose
leaves
were
opening
whose
branches
were
filled
with
the
sap
of
springtime
elizabeth
seemed
to
wake
almost
automatically
from
a
kind
of
stupor
she
pushed
back
her
veil
and
philip
stealing
eager
glances
towards
her
was
almost
startled
by
some
indefinable
change
her
face
seemed
more
delicate
almost
the
face
of
an
invalid
and
she
lay
back
there
with
eyes
the
strength
of
her
mouth
seemed
to
have
dissolved
and
its
sweetness
had
become
almost
pathetic
there
were
signs
of
a
great
weariness
about
her
the
fingers
which
reached
out
for
the
little
seemed
to
have
become
thinner
take
the
turn
to
the
left
john
she
instructed
the
one
to
bay
shore
go
slowly
by
the
lake
and
stop
where
i
tell
you
they
left
the
main
road
and
travelled
for
some
distance
along
a
lane
which
with
its
fences
and
meadows
beyond
was
curiously
reminiscent
of
england
they
passed
a
country
house
built
of
the
wood
which
was
still
a
little
unfamiliar
to
philip
but
wonderfully
homelike
with
its
cluster
of
outbuildings
its
trim
lawns
and
the
turret
clock
over
the
stable
entrance
then
through
the
leaves
of
an
avenue
of
elms
they
caught
occasional
glimpses
of
the
blue
waters
of
the
lake
which
they
presently
skirted
elizabeth
eyes
travelled
over
its
placid
surface
idly
yet
with
a
sense
of
passive
satisfaction
in
a
few
minutes
they
passed
into
the
heart
of
a
little
wood
and
she
leaned
forward
stop
here
close
to
the
side
of
the
road
john
stop
your
engine
please
and
go
and
sit
by
the
lake
the
man
obeyed
at
once
with
the
unquestioning
readiness
of
one
used
to
his
mistress
whims
for
several
minutes
she
remained
silent
she
had
the
air
of
one
drinking
in
with
almost
passionate
eagerness
the
sedative
effect
of
the
stillness
the
soft
spring
air
the
musical
country
sounds
the
ripple
of
the
breeze
in
the
trees
the
humming
of
insects
the
soft
splash
of
the
lake
against
the
stony
shore
philip
himself
was
awakened
into
a
peculiar
sense
of
pleasure
by
this
almost
his
first
glimpse
of
the
country
since
his
arrival
in
new
york
a
host
of
half
forgotten
sensations
warmed
his
heart
he
felt
suddenly
intensely
sympathetic
perhaps
more
genuinely
tender
than
he
had
ever
felt
before
towards
the
woman
by
his
side
whose
hour
of
suffering
it
was
his
hand
slipped
under
the
rug
and
held
her
fingers
which
clutched
his
in
instantaneous
response
her
lips
seemed
unlocked
by
his
slight
action
i
came
here
alone
two
years
ago
she
told
him
and
since
then
often
sometimes
to
study
a
difficult
part
sometimes
only
to
think
one
moment
she
released
her
fingers
from
his
drew
out
the
hatpins
from
her
hat
unwound
the
veil
and
threw
them
both
on
to
the
opposite
seat
then
she
laid
her
hands
upon
her
forehead
as
though
to
cool
it
the
little
breeze
from
the
lake
rippled
through
her
hair
bringing
them
every
now
and
then
faint
whiffs
of
perfume
from
the
bordering
gardens
there
she
exclaimed
with
a
little
murmur
of
content
that
a
action
is
it
now
i
think
i
am
getting
brave
i
have
something
to
say
to
you
philip
he
felt
her
fingers
seeking
his
again
and
held
them
tightly
it
was
curious
how
in
that
moment
of
crisis
his
thoughts
seemed
to
wander
away
he
was
watching
the
little
flecks
of
gold
in
her
hair
wondering
if
he
had
ever
properly
appreciated
the
beautiful
curve
of
her
neck
even
her
voice
seemed
somehow
attuned
to
the
melody
of
their
surroundings
the
confused
song
of
the
birds
the
sighing
of
the
lake
the
passing
of
the
west
wind
through
the
trees
and
shrubs
around
philip
she
began
clinging
closely
to
him
i
have
brought
you
here
to
tell
you
a
story
which
perhaps
you
will
think
when
you
have
heard
it
might
better
have
been
told
in
my
well
i
could
besides
i
wanted
to
get
away
it
is
about
sylvanus
power
he
sat
a
little
more
upright
his
nerves
were
tingling
now
with
eagerness
yes
i
met
him
she
continued
eight
years
ago
out
west
when
i
was
in
a
travelling
show
i
accepted
his
attentions
at
first
carelessly
enough
i
did
not
realise
the
sort
of
man
he
was
he
was
a
great
personage
even
in
those
days
and
i
suppose
my
head
was
a
little
turned
then
he
began
to
follow
us
everywhere
there
was
a
scandal
of
course
in
the
end
i
left
the
company
and
came
to
new
york
he
went
to
china
where
he
has
always
had
large
interests
when
i
heard
that
he
had
sailed
i
remember
reading
it
in
the
paper
i
could
have
sobbed
with
joy
philip
moved
a
little
uneasily
in
his
place
some
instinct
told
him
however
how
greatly
she
desired
his
silence
that
she
wanted
to
tell
her
story
her
own
way
then
followed
three
miserable
years
during
which
i
saw
little
of
him
i
knew
that
i
had
talent
i
was
always
sure
of
making
a
living
but
i
got
no
further
it
did
seem
possible
to
get
any
further
nothing
that
i
could
do
or
say
seemed
able
to
procure
for
me
an
engagement
in
new
york
think
of
me
for
a
moment
now
philip
as
a
woman
absolutely
and
entirely
devoted
to
her
work
i
loved
it
it
absorbed
all
my
thoughts
it
was
just
the
one
thing
in
life
i
cared
anything
about
i
simply
ached
to
get
at
new
york
and
i
could
all
the
time
i
had
to
play
on
tour
and
you
wo
quite
understand
this
dear
but
there
is
nothing
so
wearing
in
life
as
for
any
one
with
my
cravings
for
recognition
there
to
be
always
playing
on
the
road
she
paused
for
a
few
minutes
there
was
a
loud
twittering
of
birds
a
rabbit
who
had
stolen
carefully
through
the
undergrowth
scurried
away
a
car
had
come
through
the
wood
and
swept
past
them
bringing
with
it
some
vague
sense
of
disturbance
it
was
some
little
time
before
she
settled
down
again
to
her
story
at
the
end
of
those
three
years
she
went
on
sylvanus
power
had
become
richer
stronger
more
masterful
than
ever
i
was
beginning
to
lose
heart
he
was
clever
he
studied
my
every
weakness
he
knew
quite
well
that
with
me
there
was
only
one
way
and
he
laid
his
schemes
with
regard
to
me
just
in
the
same
fashion
as
he
schemed
to
be
a
conqueror
of
men
to
build
up
those
millions
we
were
playing
near
new
york
and
one
day
he
asked
me
to
motor
in
there
and
lunch
with
him
i
accepted
it
was
in
the
springtime
almost
on
such
a
day
as
this
we
motored
up
in
one
of
his
wonderful
cars
we
lunched
i
remember
how
shabby
i
felt
at
the
best
restaurant
in
new
york
where
i
was
waited
upon
like
a
queen
somehow
or
other
the
man
had
always
the
knack
of
making
himself
felt
wherever
he
went
he
strode
the
very
streets
of
new
york
like
one
of
its
masters
and
the
people
seemed
to
recognise
it
afterwards
he
took
me
into
broadway
and
he
ordered
the
car
to
stop
outside
the
theatre
where
i
am
now
playing
i
looked
at
it
and
i
remember
i
gave
a
little
cry
of
interest
is
the
new
theatre
that
every
one
is
talking
about
is
it
i
asked
him
eagerly
is
he
answered
you
like
to
see
inside
of
course
i
was
half
crazy
with
curiosity
the
doors
flew
open
before
him
and
he
took
me
everywhere
you
know
yourself
what
a
magnificent
place
it
is
that
marvellous
stage
the
auditorium
all
in
dark
green
satin
the
seats
like
armchairs
the
dressing
rooms
like
boudoirs
the
wonderful
spaciousness
of
it
it
took
my
breath
away
i
had
never
imagined
such
splendour
when
we
had
finished
looking
over
the
whole
building
i
clutched
his
arm
ca
believe
that
it
is
some
sort
of
fairy
palace
i
exclaimed
and
to
think
that
no
one
knows
who
owns
the
place
or
when
it
is
going
to
be
opened
tell
you
all
about
that
he
answered
built
it
i
own
it
and
it
will
be
opened
just
when
you
accept
my
offer
and
play
in
it
it
all
seemed
too
amazing
for
a
time
i
could
speak
coherently
then
i
remember
thinking
that
whatever
happened
whatever
price
i
had
to
pay
i
must
stand
upon
the
stage
of
that
theatre
and
win
my
lips
were
quite
dry
his
great
voice
seemed
to
have
faded
into
a
whisper
offer
i
repeated
he
answered
gruffly
there
was
a
silence
which
seemed
to
philip
interminable
all
the
magic
of
the
place
had
passed
away
its
music
seemed
no
longer
to
be
singing
happiness
into
his
heart
then
at
last
he
realised
that
she
was
waiting
for
him
to
speak
he
wanted
to
marry
you
he
faltered
he
had
a
wife
already
splash
john
was
throwing
stones
into
the
lake
a
pastime
of
which
he
was
getting
a
little
tired
a
huge
thrush
was
thinking
about
commencing
to
build
his
nest
and
in
the
meantime
sat
upon
a
fallen
log
across
the
way
and
sang
about
it
a
little
bird
ran
round
and
round
the
trunk
of
the
nearest
elm
staring
at
them
every
time
he
appeared
with
his
tiny
black
eyes
a
squirrel
almost
overhead
who
had
long
since
come
to
the
conclusion
that
they
were
harmless
decided
now
that
they
had
the
queerest
manners
of
any
two
young
people
he
had
ever
watched
from
his
leafy
throne
and
finally
abandoned
his
position
elizabeth
had
been
staring
down
the
road
ever
since
the
last
words
had
passed
her
lips
she
turned
at
last
and
looked
at
her
companion
he
was
once
more
the
refugee
the
man
flying
from
horrors
greater
even
than
he
had
known
she
began
to
tremble
philip
she
cried
say
anything
but
speak
to
me
like
a
flash
he
seemed
to
pass
from
his
own
almost
the
hermit
way
of
looking
out
upon
life
from
the
standpoint
of
his
inherent
puritanism
into
a
closer
sympathy
with
those
others
the
men
and
women
of
the
world
into
which
he
had
so
lately
entered
the
men
and
women
who
had
welcomed
him
so
human
beings
all
of
them
who
lived
and
loved
with
glad
hearts
and
much
kindliness
the
contrast
was
absurd
the
story
itself
suddenly
so
reasonable
no
other
woman
on
tour
would
have
kept
sylvanus
power
waiting
for
three
years
only
elizabeth
could
have
done
that
it
was
such
a
human
little
problem
people
did
live
in
the
clouds
he
was
fit
for
the
clouds
himself
nevertheless
when
he
tried
to
speak
his
throat
was
hard
and
dry
and
at
the
second
attempt
he
began
instead
to
laugh
she
gripped
his
arm
philip
she
exclaimed
be
reasonable
say
what
you
like
but
look
and
behave
like
a
human
being
do
make
that
noise
she
almost
shrieked
he
stopped
at
once
forgive
me
he
begged
humbly
i
ca
help
it
i
seem
to
be
playing
hide
and
seek
with
myself
you
have
finished
the
story
yet
if
there
is
anything
more
to
tell
me
she
drew
herself
up
she
spoke
absolutely
without
faltering
i
accepted
sylvanus
power
terms
she
went
on
he
placed
large
sums
of
money
in
fink
hands
to
run
the
theatre
there
was
a
wonderful
opening
you
were
not
interested
then
or
you
might
have
heard
of
it
i
produced
a
new
play
of
clyde
fitch
it
was
a
great
triumph
the
house
was
packed
sylvanus
power
sat
in
his
box
it
was
to
be
his
night
through
it
all
i
fought
like
a
woman
in
a
nightmare
i
did
know
what
it
meant
i
knew
hundreds
of
women
who
had
done
in
a
small
way
what
i
was
prepared
to
do
magnificently
in
all
my
acquaintance
i
think
that
i
scarcely
knew
one
who
would
have
refused
to
do
what
i
was
doing
and
all
the
time
i
was
in
a
state
of
fierce
revolt
i
had
moments
when
my
ambitions
when
new
york
itself
the
mecca
of
my
dreams
and
that
marvellous
theatre
with
its
marble
and
silk
seemed
suddenly
to
dwindle
to
a
miserable
contemptible
little
doll
house
and
then
again
i
played
and
i
felt
my
soul
as
i
played
and
the
old
dreams
swept
over
me
and
i
said
that
it
was
anything
to
do
with
personal
vanity
that
made
me
crave
for
the
big
gifts
of
success
that
it
was
my
art
and
that
i
must
find
myself
in
my
art
or
die
the
blood
was
flowing
in
his
veins
again
she
was
coming
back
to
him
he
was
ashamed
he
with
his
giant
load
of
sin
his
voice
trembled
with
tenderness
go
on
he
begged
i
think
that
the
reason
i
played
that
night
as
though
i
were
inspired
was
because
of
the
great
passionate
craving
at
my
heart
for
forgetfulness
to
shut
out
the
memory
of
that
man
who
sat
almost
gloomily
alone
in
his
box
waiting
and
then
after
it
was
all
over
the
wonder
and
the
glory
of
it
he
appeared
suddenly
in
my
elbowing
his
way
through
excited
journalists
kicking
bouquets
of
flowers
from
his
path
we
stood
for
a
moment
face
to
face
he
came
nearer
i
shrank
away
i
was
terrified
he
looked
at
me
in
cold
surprise
minutes
he
exclaimed
say
i
off
to
china
stick
at
it
you
done
well
for
a
start
but
remember
a
new
york
audience
wants
holding
choose
your
plays
carefully
trust
fink
going
away
i
almost
shrieked
he
glanced
at
his
watch
leaned
over
and
kissed
me
on
the
forehead
barely
make
that
boat
he
muttered
and
rushed
philip
was
breathless
the
strange
untold
passion
of
the
whole
thing
was
coming
to
him
in
waves
of
wonderful
suggestion
finish
he
cried
impatiently
finish
that
is
the
end
she
said
i
played
for
two
years
and
a
half
with
scarcely
a
pause
then
i
came
to
europe
for
a
rest
and
travelled
back
with
you
on
the
last
night
i
saw
sylvanus
power
again
for
the
first
time
do
speak
my
story
is
in
two
halves
that
is
the
first
the
second
is
just
one
question
that
will
come
before
we
reach
home
john
she
called
the
man
approached
promptly
he
was
quite
weary
of
throwing
stones
take
us
somewhere
to
lunch
his
mistress
directed
and
get
back
to
new
york
at
six
chapter
viii
it
was
not
until
they
were
crossing
brooklyn
bridge
on
their
way
into
the
city
that
she
asked
him
that
question
they
crawled
along
one
of
an
interminable
tangled
line
of
vehicles
of
all
sorts
and
conditions
the
trains
rattling
overhead
and
endless
streams
of
earnest
people
passing
along
the
footway
below
them
the
evening
sunlight
flashed
upon
the
murky
waters
glittered
from
the
windows
of
the
tall
buildings
and
shone
a
little
mercilessly
upon
the
unlovely
purlieus
of
the
great
human
hive
the
wind
had
turned
cool
and
elizabeth
with
a
little
shiver
had
drawn
her
furs
around
her
neck
all
through
the
day
during
the
luncheon
in
an
unpretentious
little
inn
and
the
leisurely
homeward
drive
she
had
been
once
more
entirely
herself
pleasant
and
sympathetic
ignoring
absolutely
the
intangible
barrier
which
had
grown
up
between
them
soon
to
be
thrown
down
for
ever
or
to
remain
for
all
time
we
left
our
heroine
she
said
at
an
interesting
crisis
in
her
career
i
am
waiting
to
hear
from
you
what
would
you
have
done
in
her
place
he
answered
her
at
once
and
he
spoke
from
the
lesser
heights
he
was
fiercely
jealous
it
is
not
a
reasonable
question
he
declared
i
am
not
a
woman
i
am
just
a
man
who
has
led
an
unusually
narrow
and
cramped
life
until
these
last
few
months
that
is
scarcely
fair
she
objected
you
profess
to
have
loved
to
love
still
i
hope
that
in
itself
makes
a
man
of
any
one
then
you
too
have
sinned
you
too
are
one
of
those
who
have
yielded
to
passion
of
a
sort
therefore
your
judgment
ought
to
be
the
better
worth
having
he
winced
as
though
he
had
been
struck
and
looked
at
her
with
eyes
momentarily
wild
he
felt
that
the
deliberate
cruelty
of
her
words
was
of
intent
an
instinct
of
her
brain
defying
for
the
moment
her
heart
i
do
know
he
faltered
i
wo
answer
your
question
i
ca
you
see
the
love
you
speak
of
is
my
love
for
you
you
ask
me
to
ignore
that
i
who
am
clinging
on
to
life
by
one
rope
you
are
like
all
men
she
sighed
we
do
not
blame
you
for
it
perhaps
we
love
you
the
more
but
when
a
great
crisis
comes
you
think
only
of
yourselves
you
disappoint
me
a
little
philip
i
fancied
that
you
might
have
thought
a
little
of
me
something
of
sylvanus
power
i
have
your
sympathy
for
other
people
he
declared
hoarsely
no
she
assented
sympathy
is
the
one
thing
a
man
lacks
it
is
your
fault
philip
you
are
to
be
pitied
for
it
and
after
all
it
is
a
woman
gift
is
it
there
followed
then
a
silence
which
seemed
interminable
it
was
not
until
they
were
nearing
the
theatre
that
he
suddenly
spoke
with
a
passion
which
startled
her
tell
me
he
insisted
last
night
i
ca
help
asking
i
was
in
hell
he
told
himself
afterwards
that
there
could
be
any
possible
way
of
reconciling
cruelty
so
with
all
that
he
knew
of
elizabeth
she
behaved
as
though
his
question
had
fallen
upon
deaf
ears
the
car
had
stopped
before
the
entrance
to
the
theatre
she
stepped
out
even
before
he
could
assist
her
hurried
across
the
pavement
and
looked
back
at
him
for
one
moment
only
before
she
plunged
into
the
dark
passage
she
nodded
and
there
was
an
utterly
meaningless
smile
upon
her
lips
she
said
do
you
mind
telling
john
he
need
wait
for
me
then
she
disappeared
he
stood
motionless
upon
the
pavement
a
little
dazed
two
or
three
people
jostled
against
him
a
policeman
glanced
at
him
curiously
a
lady
with
very
yellow
hair
winked
in
his
face
philip
pulled
himself
together
and
simultaneously
felt
a
touch
upon
his
elbow
he
glanced
into
the
face
of
the
girl
who
had
accosted
him
and
for
a
moment
he
scarcely
recognised
her
wish
you
remember
you
in
new
york
and
not
one
of
your
own
sleepy
old
towns
miss
grimes
remarked
brusquely
you
have
a
policeman
say
you
drunk
in
a
minute
if
you
stand
there
letting
people
shove
you
around
he
fell
into
step
by
her
side
and
they
walked
slowly
along
martha
was
plainly
dressed
but
she
was
wearing
new
clothes
new
shoes
and
a
new
hat
do
stare
at
me
as
though
you
never
saw
me
out
of
a
garret
before
she
went
on
a
little
sharply
your
friend
miss
dalstan
is
a
lady
who
understands
things
when
i
arrived
at
the
theatre
this
morning
i
found
that
it
was
to
be
a
permanent
job
all
right
and
there
was
a
little
advance
for
me
waiting
in
an
envelope
that
fat
old
fink
began
to
cough
and
look
at
my
clothes
so
i
got
one
in
first
is
for
me
to
make
myself
look
smart
enough
for
your
theatre
i
suppose
i
said
me
an
hour
off
and
i
do
it
so
he
grinned
and
here
i
am
done
a
good
day
work
too
copying
the
parts
of
your
play
for
a
road
company
and
answering
letters
what
wrong
with
you
the
very
sound
of
her
voice
was
a
tonic
he
almost
smiled
as
he
answered
her
just
a
sort
of
hankering
for
the
moon
and
a
sudden
fear
lest
i
get
it
you
spoilt
that
what
the
matter
with
you
she
declared
brusquely
it
never
occurred
to
me
he
said
gloomily
that
life
had
been
oh
cut
it
out
she
answered
here
you
are
not
only
set
on
your
feet
but
absolutely
held
up
there
all
the
papers
full
of
merton
brilliant
play
and
merton
ware
the
new
dramatist
with
his
social
gifts
such
an
acquisition
to
new
york
society
why
it
is
so
very
long
ago
after
all
that
you
had
a
soul
in
new
york
to
speak
to
i
saw
something
in
your
face
that
night
i
thought
you
were
hungry
so
you
were
only
it
was
for
food
it
cheered
you
up
even
to
talk
with
me
and
look
at
you
clubs
and
parties
and
fine
friends
and
there
you
were
half
dazed
in
broadway
be
careful
man
you
do
know
what
it
is
to
be
down
and
out
you
have
been
as
near
it
as
i
have
anyway
or
you
lift
your
head
up
and
be
thankful
martha
he
began
earnestly
miss
grimes
she
interrupted
firmly
do
let
there
be
any
mistake
about
that
i
hate
familiarity
miss
grimes
then
he
went
on
you
talk
about
my
friends
quite
right
i
should
think
i
have
been
introduced
to
nearly
a
thousand
people
since
the
night
my
play
was
produced
i
have
dined
at
a
score
of
houses
and
many
scores
of
restaurants
the
people
are
pleasant
enough
too
but
all
the
time
it
merton
ware
the
dramatist
they
are
patting
on
the
back
they
do
know
anything
about
merton
ware
the
man
perhaps
there
are
some
of
them
would
be
glad
to
but
you
see
it
too
soon
and
they
seem
to
live
too
quickly
here
to
make
friends
i
am
almost
as
lonely
as
i
was
so
far
as
regards
ordinary
companionship
last
night
i
felt
the
first
little
glow
of
real
friendliness
just
the
men
down
at
the
club
you
put
all
your
eggs
into
one
basket
that
what
you
done
she
declared
that
true
enough
he
groaned
and
like
all
men
selfish
brutes
she
proceeded
deliberately
you
expect
everything
fancy
expecting
everything
from
a
woman
like
miss
dalstan
why
you
are
worthy
of
it
you
know
perhaps
not
he
admitted
but
you
see
miss
grimes
there
is
something
in
life
which
seems
to
have
passed
you
by
up
till
now
has
it
indeed
she
objected
you
think
i
never
had
a
young
man
eh
perhaps
you
right
have
found
much
time
for
that
sort
of
rubbish
anyway
this
is
where
i
hop
on
a
trolley
car
wait
a
moment
he
begged
do
leave
me
yet
you
nothing
to
do
have
you
nothing
particular
she
confessed
except
go
home
and
cook
my
dinner
look
here
he
went
on
eagerly
i
feel
like
work
i
got
the
second
act
of
my
new
play
in
my
mind
come
round
with
me
and
let
me
try
dictating
it
i
give
you
something
to
eat
in
my
rooms
it
for
the
theatre
mind
i
never
tried
dictating
i
believe
i
could
do
it
to
you
in
your
rooms
she
repeated
a
little
doubtfully
they
wo
talk
scandal
about
us
miss
grimes
he
assured
her
to
tell
you
the
truth
i
want
to
be
near
the
telephone
in
case
she
rings
you
up
eh
that
so
i
said
something
i
ought
not
to
have
done
i
ought
to
have
waited
for
her
but
it
was
something
that
had
been
tearing
at
me
ever
since
last
night
and
i
could
bear
it
some
blunderers
you
men
miss
grimes
sighed
well
i
with
you
he
led
her
almost
apologetically
to
the
lift
of
the
handsome
building
in
which
his
new
rooms
were
situated
they
were
very
pleasant
bachelor
rooms
with
black
oak
walls
and
green
hangings
prints
upon
the
wall
a
serviceable
and
a
deep
green
carpet
she
looked
around
her
and
at
the
servant
who
had
come
forward
at
their
entrance
with
a
little
sniff
shall
you
be
changing
sir
he
asked
not
philip
answered
quickly
tell
the
waiter
to
send
up
a
simple
dinner
for
two
i
ca
bother
to
order
and
two
cocktails
he
added
as
an
afterthought
martha
stared
after
the
disappearing
manservant
disparagingly
some
style
she
muttered
a
manservant
eh
do
know
as
i
ever
saw
one
before
off
the
stage
do
be
silly
he
remonstrated
he
has
four
other
flats
to
look
after
besides
mine
it
the
way
one
lives
nowadays
cheaper
than
ordinary
hotels
or
rooms
take
off
your
coat
she
obeyed
him
depositing
it
carefully
in
a
safe
place
then
she
strolled
around
the
room
finding
pictures
little
to
her
taste
and
finally
threw
herself
into
an
are
we
going
to
work
before
we
eat
she
asked
no
afterwards
he
told
her
have
a
cigarette
she
held
it
between
her
fingers
but
declined
a
match
i
wait
for
the
cocktails
she
decided
now
listen
here
ware
there
a
word
or
two
i
like
to
say
to
you
go
ahead
he
invited
listlessly
you
men
she
continued
looking
him
squarely
in
the
face
think
a
lot
too
much
of
yourselves
you
think
so
much
of
yourselves
that
as
often
as
not
you
no
time
to
think
of
other
folk
a
month
or
so
ago
who
were
you
you
were
hiding
in
a
cheap
tenement
house
scared
out
of
your
wits
dressed
pretty
near
as
shabbily
as
i
was
with
a
detective
on
your
track
and
with
no
idea
of
what
you
were
going
to
do
for
a
living
and
now
look
at
you
who
done
it
all
of
course
my
play
being
successful
he
began
she
broke
in
at
once
you
and
your
play
who
took
your
play
who
produced
it
at
the
new
york
theatre
and
acted
in
it
so
that
people
could
listen
without
a
sob
in
their
throats
and
a
tingling
all
over
yours
is
the
only
play
in
the
world
i
bet
miss
dalstan
has
a
box
full
of
them
she
probably
chose
yours
because
she
knew
that
you
were
feeling
pretty
miserable
because
she
got
sorry
for
you
coming
over
on
the
steamer
because
she
has
a
great
big
heart
and
is
always
trying
to
do
something
for
others
made
a
man
of
you
oh
i
know
a
bit
about
plays
i
know
that
with
the
royalties
you
drawing
you
can
well
afford
rooms
like
these
and
anything
else
you
want
but
that
is
all
she
done
she
introduced
you
to
her
friends
she
taken
more
notice
of
you
than
any
man
around
she
takes
you
out
automobile
driving
she
lets
you
spend
all
your
spare
time
in
her
rooms
she
do
mind
what
people
say
you
dine
with
her
and
take
her
home
after
the
play
you
have
more
of
her
than
any
other
person
alive
say
what
i
want
to
ask
is
do
you
think
you
properly
grateful
i
could
ever
repay
miss
dalstan
he
acknowledged
a
little
sadly
but
look
here
no
she
interrupted
you
think
i
do
know
anything
perhaps
i
do
and
perhaps
i
do
i
was
standing
in
the
door
of
the
office
when
you
two
came
in
from
your
automobile
drive
this
afternoon
i
saw
her
come
away
without
wishing
you
then
i
saw
her
turn
and
nod
looking
just
as
usual
and
i
saw
her
face
afterwards
if
i
had
had
you
my
man
as
close
to
me
then
as
you
are
now
i
have
boxed
your
ears
he
moved
uneasily
in
his
chair
there
was
no
doubt
about
the
earnestness
she
was
leaning
a
little
forward
and
her
brown
eyes
were
filled
with
a
hard
accusing
light
there
was
a
little
spot
of
colour
even
in
her
sallow
cheeks
she
was
unmistakably
angry
i
like
to
know
who
you
are
and
what
you
think
yourself
to
make
a
woman
look
like
that
she
wound
up
the
waiter
entered
with
the
cocktails
and
began
to
lay
the
cloth
for
dinner
philip
paced
the
room
uneasily
until
he
had
gone
look
here
my
little
friend
he
said
when
at
last
the
door
was
closed
there
a
great
deal
of
sound
common
sense
in
what
you
say
i
may
be
an
egoist
i
dare
say
i
am
i
been
through
the
proper
training
for
it
and
i
started
life
again
on
a
pretty
basis
perhaps
but
have
you
ever
been
jealous
me
jealous
she
repeated
scornfully
what
of
i
wonder
there
was
a
suspicious
glitter
in
her
eyes
a
queer
little
tremble
in
her
tone
his
question
however
was
merely
perfunctory
she
represented
little
more
to
him
at
that
moment
than
the
incarnation
of
his
own
conscience
very
likely
you
have
he
went
on
you
are
too
independent
ever
to
care
much
for
any
one
well
i
been
half
mad
with
jealousy
since
last
night
that
is
the
truth
of
it
there
another
man
wants
her
the
man
who
built
the
theatre
for
her
she
told
me
about
him
yesterday
while
we
were
out
together
do
you
want
her
to
be
happy
the
girl
asked
bluntly
of
course
i
do
then
leave
her
alone
to
choose
do
go
about
looking
as
though
you
had
a
knife
in
your
heart
if
you
find
her
turn
for
a
moment
to
some
one
else
you
do
want
her
to
choose
you
do
you
just
because
you
are
a
weakling
because
her
great
kind
heart
ca
bear
the
thought
of
making
you
miserable
stand
on
your
feet
like
a
man
and
take
your
luck
can
i
take
off
my
hat
i
ca
eat
in
this
the
waiter
had
entered
with
the
dinner
merton
opened
the
door
of
his
room
and
paced
up
and
down
for
a
few
moments
thoughtfully
when
she
reappeared
she
took
the
seat
opposite
philip
and
suddenly
smiled
at
him
an
exceedingly
rare
but
most
becoming
performance
her
mouth
seemed
at
once
to
soften
and
even
her
eyes
laughed
at
him
here
you
ask
me
to
dine
she
said
because
you
are
lonely
and
i
do
nothing
but
scold
you
never
mind
i
was
typewriting
something
of
yours
this
morning
i
forgotten
the
words
but
it
was
something
about
the
discipline
of
affection
you
can
take
my
scolding
that
way
if
i
adore
miss
dalstan
and
if
you
had
been
kind
to
me
i
should
never
take
the
trouble
to
make
myself
disagreeable
he
smiled
back
at
her
readily
falling
in
with
her
altered
mood
she
seemed
to
have
talked
the
out
of
her
blood
and
during
the
service
of
the
meal
she
told
him
of
the
comfort
of
her
work
the
charm
of
the
other
girl
in
the
room
with
whom
she
was
already
discussing
a
plan
to
share
an
apartment
when
she
came
to
speak
however
remotely
of
miss
dalstan
her
voice
seemed
instinctively
to
soften
philip
found
himself
wondering
what
had
passed
between
the
two
women
in
those
few
moments
when
elizabeth
had
left
him
and
gone
back
to
martha
room
by
some
strange
miracle
the
strong
sweet
understanding
woman
had
simply
taken
possession
of
the
friendless
child
the
thought
of
her
sat
now
in
martha
heart
an
obsession
almost
a
worship
perhaps
that
was
why
the
sense
of
companionship
between
the
two
notwithstanding
certain
obvious
disparities
seemed
to
grow
stronger
every
moment
they
drank
their
coffee
and
smoked
cigarettes
afterwards
in
lazy
fashion
suddenly
martha
sprang
up
say
i
came
here
to
work
she
exclaimed
and
i
brought
you
under
false
pretences
he
confessed
my
brain
not
working
i
ca
dictate
we
try
another
evening
you
do
mind
of
course
not
she
answered
glancing
at
the
clock
i
be
going
wait
a
little
time
longer
he
begged
she
resumed
her
seat
there
was
only
one
heavily
shaded
lamp
burning
on
the
table
and
through
the
little
cloud
of
tobacco
smoke
she
watched
him
his
eyes
were
sometimes
upon
the
timepiece
sometimes
on
the
telephone
he
seemed
always
although
his
attitude
was
one
of
repose
to
be
listening
waiting
it
was
nine
the
middle
of
the
second
act
they
knew
quite
well
that
for
a
quarter
of
an
hour
elizabeth
would
be
in
her
dressing
room
she
could
ring
up
if
she
wished
the
seconds
ticked
monotonously
away
martha
found
herself
too
sharing
that
curiously
intense
desire
to
hear
the
ring
of
the
telephone
nothing
happened
a
quarter
to
ten
came
and
passed
she
rose
to
her
feet
i
am
going
home
right
now
she
announced
he
reached
for
his
hat
i
come
with
you
he
suggested
a
little
halfheartedly
you
do
nothing
of
the
sort
she
objected
or
if
you
do
i
never
come
inside
your
rooms
again
understand
that
i
do
want
any
of
these
society
tricks
see
me
home
indeed
i
have
you
know
that
i
better
able
to
take
care
of
myself
in
the
streets
of
new
york
than
you
are
so
thank
you
for
your
dinner
and
just
you
sit
down
and
listen
for
that
telephone
it
will
ring
right
presently
and
if
it
does
go
to
bed
and
say
to
yourself
that
whatever
she
decides
is
best
she
knows
which
way
her
happiness
lies
you
do
and
it
she
who
counts
much
more
than
you
leave
off
thinking
of
yourself
quite
so
much
and
shake
hands
with
me
please
mr
ware
he
gripped
her
hand
opened
the
door
and
watched
her
sail
down
towards
the
lift
whistling
to
herself
her
hands
in
her
coat
pockets
then
he
turned
back
into
the
room
and
locked
himself
in
chapter
ix
the
slow
fever
of
inaction
fretting
in
philip
veins
culminated
soon
after
martha
departure
in
a
passionate
desire
for
a
movement
of
some
sort
the
very
silence
of
the
room
maddened
him
the
telephone
the
fire
which
had
burned
itself
out
the
dropping
even
of
the
wind
which
at
intervals
during
the
evening
had
flung
a
rainstorm
against
the
windowpane
at
midnight
he
could
bear
it
no
longer
and
sallied
out
into
the
streets
again
that
curious
desire
for
companionship
was
upon
him
a
strange
heritage
for
one
who
throughout
the
earlier
stages
of
his
life
had
been
content
with
and
had
even
sought
a
grim
and
unending
solitude
he
boarded
a
surface
car
for
the
sake
of
sitting
wedged
in
amongst
a
little
crowd
of
people
and
he
entered
his
club
noting
the
number
of
hats
and
coats
in
the
cloakroom
with
a
queer
sense
of
satisfaction
he
no
sooner
made
his
appearance
in
the
main
room
than
he
was
greeted
vociferously
from
half
a
dozen
quarters
he
accepted
every
hospitality
that
was
offered
to
him
drinking
cheerfully
with
new
as
well
as
old
acquaintances
presently
noel
bridges
came
up
and
gripped
his
shoulder
come
and
have
a
grill
with
us
ware
he
begged
there
seymour
and
richmond
here
from
the
savage
club
and
a
whole
crowd
of
us
hullo
freddy
he
went
on
greeting
the
man
with
whom
philip
had
been
talking
why
do
you
come
and
join
us
too
we
have
a
rubber
of
bridge
afterwards
that
great
the
other
declared
come
on
ware
we
rag
old
honeybrook
into
telling
us
some
of
his
stories
the
little
party
gathered
together
at
the
end
of
the
common
table
philip
had
already
drunk
much
more
than
he
was
accustomed
to
but
the
only
result
appeared
to
be
some
slight
slackening
of
the
tension
in
which
he
had
been
living
his
eyes
flashed
and
his
tongue
became
more
nimble
he
insisted
upon
ordering
wine
he
had
had
no
opportunity
yet
of
repaying
many
courtesies
they
drank
his
health
forced
him
into
the
place
of
honour
by
the
side
of
honeybrook
veteran
of
the
club
and
ate
their
meal
to
the
accompaniment
of
ceaseless
bursts
of
laughter
chaff
the
popping
of
corks
mock
speeches
badinage
of
every
sort
philip
felt
somehow
that
his
brain
had
never
been
clearer
he
not
only
held
his
own
but
he
earned
a
reputation
for
a
sense
of
humour
previously
denied
to
him
and
in
the
midst
of
it
all
the
door
opened
and
closed
and
a
huge
man
dressed
in
plain
dinner
clothes
still
wearing
his
theatre
hat
with
a
coat
upon
his
arm
and
a
stick
in
his
hand
passed
through
the
door
and
stood
for
a
moment
gazing
around
him
say
that
sylvanus
power
one
of
the
young
men
at
the
table
exclaimed
looks
a
trifle
grim
does
he
it
the
old
man
right
enough
noel
bridges
murmured
wonder
what
he
wants
down
here
it
is
in
his
beat
honeybrook
the
great
new
york
raconteur
father
of
the
club
touched
philip
upon
the
shoulder
hey
presto
he
whispered
we
who
think
so
much
of
ourselves
have
become
pigmies
upon
the
face
of
the
earth
there
towers
the
representative
of
modern
omnipotence
those
are
the
hands
grim
hands
are
they
that
grip
the
levers
of
modern
american
life
rodin
ought
to
do
a
statue
of
him
as
he
stands
there
art
and
letters
growing
smaller
as
he
grows
larger
we
exist
for
him
he
builds
theatres
for
our
plays
museums
for
our
pictures
libraries
for
our
books
seems
to
me
he
is
looking
for
one
of
us
noel
bridges
remarked
some
pose
is
it
a
younger
member
of
the
party
exclaimed
reverently
as
he
lifted
his
tankard
all
these
things
were
a
matter
of
seconds
during
which
sylvanus
power
did
indeed
stand
without
moving
looking
closely
about
the
room
then
his
eye
at
last
lit
upon
the
end
of
the
table
where
philip
and
his
friends
were
seated
he
approached
them
without
a
word
noel
bridges
ventured
upon
a
greeting
coming
to
join
us
mr
power
he
asked
sylvanus
power
if
he
heard
the
question
ignored
it
his
eyes
had
rested
upon
philip
he
stood
over
the
table
now
looming
before
them
massive
in
his
way
ware
he
said
i
been
looking
for
you
instinctively
philip
rose
to
his
feet
tall
though
he
was
he
had
to
look
up
at
the
other
man
and
his
slender
body
seemed
in
comparison
like
a
willow
wand
nevertheless
the
light
in
his
eyes
was
illuminative
there
was
no
shrinking
away
he
stood
there
with
the
air
of
one
prepared
to
welcome
to
incite
and
provoke
storm
whatever
might
be
brewing
i
have
been
to
your
rooms
sylvanus
power
went
on
they
knew
nothing
about
you
there
they
would
philip
replied
i
go
where
i
choose
and
when
i
choose
what
do
you
want
with
me
conversation
in
the
room
was
almost
suspended
those
in
the
immediate
locality
well
acquainted
with
the
gossip
of
the
city
held
the
key
to
the
situation
every
one
for
a
moment
however
was
spellbound
they
felt
the
coming
storm
but
they
were
powerless
i
sought
you
out
ware
sylvanus
power
continued
his
harsh
voice
ringing
through
the
room
to
tell
you
what
probably
every
other
man
here
knows
except
you
if
you
know
it
you
a
fool
and
i
here
to
tell
you
so
have
you
been
drinking
philip
asked
calmly
maybe
i
have
sylvanus
power
answered
but
whisky
ca
cloud
my
brain
or
stop
my
tongue
you
looking
at
my
little
toy
here
he
went
on
twirling
in
his
right
hand
a
heavy
malacca
cane
with
a
leaden
top
i
killed
a
man
with
that
once
the
weapon
seems
sufficient
for
the
purpose
philip
answered
indifferently
any
other
man
sylvanus
power
went
on
would
have
sat
in
the
chair
for
that
not
i
you
do
know
as
much
of
me
as
you
need
to
merton
ware
i
no
whippersnapper
of
a
earning
a
few
paltry
dollars
by
writing
doggerel
for
women
and
mountebanks
to
act
i
hewn
my
way
with
my
right
arm
and
my
brain
from
the
streets
to
the
palace
they
say
that
money
talks
by
god
if
it
does
i
ought
to
shout
for
i
more
million
dollars
than
there
are
men
in
this
room
nevertheless
philip
said
growing
calmer
as
he
recognised
the
condition
you
are
a
very
insufferable
fellow
there
had
been
a
little
murmur
throughout
the
room
at
the
end
of
sylvanus
power
last
blatant
speech
but
at
philip
retort
there
was
a
hushed
almost
an
awed
silence
honeybrook
rose
to
his
feet
sir
he
said
turning
to
power
to
the
best
of
my
belief
you
are
not
a
member
of
this
club
i
am
a
member
of
any
club
in
america
i
choose
to
enter
the
intruder
declared
as
for
you
writing
and
acting
popinjays
i
could
break
the
lot
of
you
if
i
chose
i
came
to
see
you
ware
come
out
from
your
friends
and
talk
to
me
philip
pushed
back
his
chair
made
his
way
deliberately
round
the
head
of
the
table
brushing
aside
several
arms
outstretched
to
prevent
his
going
sylvanus
power
stood
in
an
open
space
between
the
tables
swinging
his
cane
with
its
ugly
top
in
the
middle
of
his
hand
he
watched
approach
and
lowered
his
head
a
little
like
a
bull
about
to
charge
if
you
have
anything
to
say
to
me
philip
observed
coolly
i
am
here
but
i
warn
you
that
there
is
one
subject
which
is
never
discussed
within
these
walls
if
you
transgress
our
unwritten
rule
i
shall
neither
listen
to
what
you
have
to
say
nor
will
you
be
allowed
to
remain
here
and
what
is
that
subject
sylvanus
power
thundered
no
woman
name
is
mentioned
here
philip
told
him
calmly
several
of
the
men
had
sprung
to
their
feet
it
seemed
from
attitude
as
though
murder
might
be
done
philip
however
stood
his
ground
almost
contemptuously
his
frame
tense
and
poised
his
fists
clenched
suddenly
the
strain
passed
the
man
whose
face
for
a
moment
had
been
almost
black
with
passion
lowered
his
cane
swayed
a
little
upon
his
feet
and
recovered
himself
so
you
know
what
i
come
here
to
talk
about
young
man
he
demanded
one
can
surmise
philip
replied
if
you
think
it
worth
while
i
will
accompany
you
to
my
rooms
or
to
yours
philip
in
those
few
seconds
made
a
reputation
for
himself
which
he
never
lost
the
little
company
of
men
looked
at
one
another
in
mute
acknowledgment
of
a
courage
which
not
one
of
them
failed
to
appreciate
i
take
you
at
your
word
sylvanus
power
decided
grimly
here
boys
he
went
on
moving
towards
the
table
where
philip
had
been
seated
give
me
a
drink
some
rye
whisky
i
dry
not
a
soul
stirred
even
noel
bridges
remained
motionless
heselton
the
junior
manager
of
the
theatre
met
the
millionaire
eye
and
never
flinched
honeybrook
knocked
the
ash
from
his
cigar
and
accepted
the
role
of
spokesman
power
he
said
we
are
a
hospitable
company
here
and
we
are
at
all
times
glad
to
entertain
our
friends
at
the
same
time
the
privileges
of
the
club
are
retained
so
far
as
possible
for
those
who
conform
to
a
reasonable
standard
of
good
manners
there
was
a
sudden
thumping
of
hands
upon
the
table
until
the
glasses
rattled
power
face
showed
not
a
single
sign
of
anger
he
was
simply
puzzled
he
had
come
into
touch
with
something
which
he
could
not
understand
there
was
bridges
earning
a
salary
at
his
theatre
to
be
thrown
out
into
the
streets
or
made
a
star
of
according
to
his
whim
heselton
a
family
man
drawing
his
salary
and
a
good
one
too
also
from
the
theatre
men
whose
faces
were
familiar
to
him
some
of
them
he
knew
on
newspapers
in
which
he
owned
a
controlling
interest
the
power
of
which
he
had
bragged
was
a
real
enough
thing
what
had
come
to
these
men
that
they
failed
to
recognise
it
to
this
slim
young
boy
of
an
englishman
that
he
dared
to
defy
him
pretty
queer
crowd
you
boys
he
muttered
philip
who
had
been
waiting
by
the
door
came
a
few
steps
back
again
power
he
said
i
do
know
much
about
you
and
you
do
seem
to
know
anything
at
all
about
us
i
am
only
at
present
a
member
by
courtesy
of
this
club
but
it
is
often
that
any
one
has
reason
to
complain
of
lack
of
hospitality
here
if
you
take
my
advice
you
apologise
to
these
gentlemen
for
your
shockingly
bad
behaviour
when
you
came
in
tell

and
i
stand
you
a
drink
myself
that
goes
honeybrook
assented
gravely
it
up
to
you
sir
sylvanus
power
felt
that
he
had
wandered
into
a
he
had
found
his
way
into
one
of
those
branch
avenues
leading
from
the
great
road
of
his
imperial
success
he
was
man
enough
to
know
when
to
turn
back
gentlemen
he
said
i
offer
you
my
apologies
i
came
here
in
a
furious
temper
and
a
little
drunk
i
retract
all
that
i
said
i
drink
to
your
club
if
you
allow
me
the
privilege
willing
hands
filled
his
tumbler
and
grateful
ones
forced
a
glass
between
philip
fingers
none
of
them
really
wanted
sylvanus
power
for
an
enemy
here
looking
at
you
all
the
latter
said
luck
he
muttered
glancing
towards
philip
they
all
drank
as
though
it
were
a
rite
philip
and
sylvanus
power
set
their
glasses
down
almost
at
the
same
moment
philip
turned
towards
the
door
i
am
at
your
service
now
power
he
announced
good
night
you
fellows
there
was
a
new
ring
of
friendliness
in
the
hearty
response
which
came
from
every
corner
of
the
room
goodnight
ware
so
long
old
fellow
good
night
old
chap
there
was
a
little
delay
in
the
cloakroom
while
the
attendant
searched
for
philip
hat
which
had
been
temporarily
misplaced
honeybrook
who
had
followed
the
two
men
out
of
the
room
fumbling
for
a
moment
in
his
locker
and
coming
over
to
philip
dropped
something
into
the
overcoat
pocket
rather
like
a
scene
in
a
melodrama
is
it
ware
he
whispered
but
i
know
a
little
about
sylvanus
power
it
only
a
last
resource
mind
chapter
x
philip
fetched
his
hat
and
the
two
men
stepped
out
on
to
the
pavement
a
servant
in
quiet
grey
livery
held
open
the
door
of
an
enormous
motor
car
sylvanus
power
beckoned
his
companion
to
precede
him
home
he
told
the
man
unless
he
added
turning
to
philip
rather
go
to
your
rooms
i
am
quite
indifferent
philip
replied
they
drove
off
in
absolute
silence
a
silence
which
remained
unbroken
until
they
passed
through
some
elaborate
iron
gates
and
drew
up
before
a
mansion
in
fifth
avenue
you
wait
sylvanus
power
ordered
and
take
this
gentleman
home
this
way
sir
the
doors
rolled
open
before
them
philip
caught
a
vista
of
a
wonderful
hall
with
a
domed
roof
and
stained
glass
windows
and
a
fountain
playing
from
some
marble
statuary
at
the
further
end
a
personage
in
black
took
his
coat
and
hat
the
door
of
a
dining
room
stood
open
a
table
covered
with
a
profusion
of
flowers
was
laid
and
places
set
for
two
sylvanus
power
turned
abruptly
to
a
footman
you
can
have
that
cleared
away
he
directed
harshly
no
supper
will
be
required
he
swung
around
and
led
the
way
into
a
room
at
the
rear
of
the
hall
a
room
which
in
comparison
with
philip
confused
impressions
of
the
rest
of
the
place
was
almost
plainly
furnished
there
was
a
small
oak
sideboard
upon
which
was
set
out
whisky
and
soda
and
cigars
a
great
desk
covered
with
papers
before
which
a
young
man
was
seated
two
telephone
instruments
and
a
phonograph
the
walls
were
lined
with
books
the
room
itself
was
long
and
narrow
power
turned
to
the
young
man
you
can
go
to
bed
george
he
ordered
disconnect
the
telephones
the
young
man
gathered
up
some
papers
locked
the
desk
in
silence
bowed
to
his
employer
and
left
the
room
without
a
word
power
waited
until
the
door
was
closed
then
he
stood
up
with
his
back
to
the
fireplace
and
pointed
to
a
chair
you
can
sit
if
you
like
he
invited
drink
or
smoke
if
you
want
to
you
welcome
thank
you
philip
replied
i
rather
stand
you
do
want
even
to
take
a
chair
in
my
house
i
suppose
sylvanus
power
went
on
mockingly
or
drink
my
whisky
or
smoke
my
cigars
eh
from
the
little
i
have
seen
of
you
philip
confessed
my
inclinations
are
certainly
against
accepting
any
hospitality
at
your
hands
that
a
trick
i
suppose
sylvanus
power
sneered
stringing
out
your
sentences
as
pat
as
butter
it
not
my
way
the
truth
always
at
the
back
of
my
head
and
the
words
ready
to
fit
it
but
they
come
as
they
please
i
seem
to
have
noticed
that
philip
observed
what
sort
of
a
man
are
you
anyway
the
other
demanded
his
heavy
eyebrows
suddenly
lowering
his
wonderful
keen
eyes
riveted
upon
philip
can
i
buy
you
i
wonder
or
threaten
you
that
rather
depends
upon
what
it
is
you
want
from
me
i
want
you
to
leave
this
country
and
never
set
foot
in
it
again
what
i
want
of
you
i
want
you
to
get
back
to
your
london
slums
and
write
your
stuff
there
and
have
it
played
in
your
own
poky
little
theatres
i
want
you
out
of
new
york
and
i
want
you
out
quick
then
i
am
afraid
philip
regretted
that
we
are
wasting
time
i
have
the
least
intention
of
leaving
new
york
well
we
go
through
the
rigmarole
power
continued
gruffly
got
to
understand
one
another
there
my
cheque
book
in
that
safe
a
million
dollars
if
you
leave
this
country
alone
within
hours
and
stay
away
for
the
rest
of
your
life
philip
raised
his
eyebrows
he
was
lounging
slightly
against
the
desk
i
should
have
no
use
for
a
million
dollars
power
he
said
if
i
had
i
should
not
take
it
from
you
and
further
the
conditions
you
suggest
are
absurd
bribery
no
good
eh
power
observed
what
about
threats
there
was
a
man
once
who
wrote
a
letter
to
a
certain
woman
which
i
found
i
killed
him
a
few
days
afterwards
there
was
a
sort
of
a
scuffle
but
it
was
murder
right
enough
i
am
nearer
the
door
than
you
are
and
i
should
say
about
three
times
as
strong
how
would
a
fight
suit
you
ware
hand
was
in
his
overcoat
pocket
not
particularly
he
answered
besides
it
would
be
fair
you
see
i
am
armed
and
you
not
as
though
for
curiosity
he
drew
from
his
pocket
the
little
revolver
which
honeybrook
had
slipped
into
it
power
looked
at
it
and
shrugged
his
shoulders
we
leave
that
out
then
for
the
moment
he
said
now
listen
to
me
i
off
on
another
tack
now
eight
years
ago
i
met
elizabeth
dalstan
i
was
years
old
then
i
am
now
you
young
men
nowadays
go
through
your
life
they
tell
me
with
a
woman
on
your
hands
most
of
the
time
waste
yourself
out
in
a
score
of
passions
go
through
the
same
old
rigmarole
once
a
year
or
something
like
it
i
was
married
when
i
was
i
got
married
to
lay
my
hands
on
the
first
ten
thousand
dollars
i
needed
my
wife
left
me
fifteen
years
ago
you
may
have
read
of
her
she
was
a
storekeeper
daughter
then
she
has
a
flat
in
paris
now
a
country
house
in
england
a
villa
at
monte
carlo
and
another
at
florence
she
lives
her
life
i
live
mine
she
the
only
woman
i
ever
spoken
a
civil
word
to
until
i
met
elizabeth
dalstan
or
since
philip
was
interested
despite
his
violent
antipathy
to
the
man
a
singular
record
of
fidelity
he
remarked
suavely
if
you
drop
that
talk
and
speak
like
a
man
i
like
you
better
sylvanus
power
continued
there
it
is
in
plain
words
i
lived
with
my
wife
until
we
quarrelled
and
she
left
me
and
while
she
lived
with
me
i
thought
no
more
of
women
than
cats
when
she
went
i
thought
i
done
with
the
sex
elizabeth
dalstan
happened
along
and
i
found
i
had
even
begun
eight
years
ago
we
met
i
offered
her
at
once
everything
i
could
offer
nothing
doing
we
do
need
to
tell
one
another
that
she
is
that
sort
i
went
off
and
left
her
spent
a
winter
in
siberia
and
came
home
by
china
i
suppose
there
were
women
there
and
in
paris
i
was
there
for
a
month
i
did
see
them
then
america
elizabeth
dalstan
was
still
touring
not
doing
much
good
for
herself
i
hung
around
for
a
time
tried
my
luck
once
more
no
go
then
i
went
back
to
europe
offered
my
wife
ten
million
and
an
income
for
a
divorce
it
did
suit
her
so
i
came
back
again
the
third
time
i
found
elizabeth
discouraged
if
ever
a
man
found
a
woman
at
the
right
time
i
did
she
is
ambitious
lord
knows
why
i
hate
acting
and
the
theatres
and
everything
to
do
with
them
however
i
tried
a
new
move
i
built
that
theatre
in
new
york
there
is
another
place
like
it
in
the
world
and
offered
it
to
her
for
a
birthday
present
then
she
began
to
hesitate
look
here
philip
broke
in
i
know
all
this
i
know
everything
you
have
told
me
and
everything
you
can
tell
me
what
about
it
what
have
you
got
to
say
to
me
this
sylvanus
power
declared
striking
the
desk
with
his
clenched
fist
i
have
only
had
one
consolation
all
the
time
i
have
been
waiting
there
has
been
no
other
man
elizabeth
is
that
sort
each
time
i
was
separated
and
came
back
i
just
looked
at
her
and
i
knew
that
why
i
have
been
patient
that
is
why
i
have
insisted
upon
my
debt
being
paid
you
understand
that
i
hear
what
you
say
power
crossed
the
room
helped
himself
to
whisky
and
returned
to
his
place
with
the
tumbler
in
his
hand
there
was
a
brief
silence
a
little
clock
upon
the
mantelpiece
struck
two
the
street
sounds
outside
had
ceased
save
for
the
hoot
of
an
occasional
taxicab
philip
was
conscious
of
a
burning
desire
to
get
away
this
man
this
great
lump
of
power
and
success
standing
like
a
colossus
in
his
wonderful
home
infuriated
him
that
a
man
should
live
who
thought
he
had
a
right
such
as
he
claimed
was
maddening
well
power
proceeded
setting
down
the
tumbler
empty
you
wo
be
bought
how
am
i
going
to
get
you
out
of
the
way
you
ca
do
it
philip
asserted
i
am
going
morning
to
elizabeth
and
i
am
going
to
pray
her
to
marry
me
at
once
power
swayed
for
a
single
moment
upon
his
feet
the
teeth
gleamed
between
his
slightly
parted
lips
his
great
arm
was
outstretched
its
bursting
muscles
showing
against
the
sleeve
of
his
dinner
coat
his
chest
was
heaving
if
you
do
it
he
shouted
i
close
the
theatre
and
sack
every
one
in
it
i
buy
any
theatre
in
new
york
where
you
try
to
present
your
play
i
buy
every
manager
she
goes
to
for
an
engagement
every
newspaper
that
says
a
word
of
praise
of
any
work
of
yours
i
tell
you
i
stand
behind
the
scenes
and
pull
the
strings
which
shall
bring
you
and
her
to
the
knowledge
of
what
failure
and
want
mean
i
give
up
the
great
things
in
life
i
devote
every
dollar
i
have
every
thought
of
my
brain
every
atom
of
my
power
to
bringing
you
two
face
to
face
with
misery
that
if
i
keep
my
hands
off
you
i
may
do
that
philip
shrugged
his
shoulders
if
i
put
you
in
a
play
he
said
which
is
where
you
really
belong
people
would
find
you
humorous
your
threats
do
affect
me
at
all
power
elizabeth
can
choose
power
leaned
over
to
the
switch
and
turned
on
an
electric
light
above
philip
head
blast
you
let
me
look
at
you
he
thundered
you
a
sickly
creature
to
call
yourself
a
man
ca
you
see
this
thing
as
i
see
it
you
the
sort
that
had
women
and
plenty
of
them
another
will
do
for
you
and
my
god
she
is
the
only
one
i
looked
at
i
sylvanus

who

ruled

and
ruled
men
all
my
life
i
want
her
do
be
a
fool
get
out
of
my
path
i
crushed
a
hundred
such
men
as
you
in
my
day
philip
took
up
his
hat
we
are
wasting
time
he
observed
you
are
a
cruder
person
than
i
thought
you
power
i
am
sorry
for
you
if
that
anything
sorry
for
me
you
very
philip
continued
you
see
you
imbibed
a
false
view
of
life
you
placed
yourself
amongst
the
gods
and
your
feet
really
are
made
of
very
sticky
clay
shall
i
find
my
own
way
out
you
can
find
your
way
to
hell
power
roared
use
your
toy
pistol
if
you
want
to
you
going
where
you
never
need
it
again
he
took
a
giant
stride
a
stride
which
was
more
like
the
spring
of
a
maddened
bull
towards
philip
the
veneer
of
a
spurious
civilisation
seemed
to
have
fallen
from
him
he
was
the
great
and
splendid
animal
transformed
with
an
overmastering
passion
there
was
murder
in
his
eyes
his
great
right
arm
with
its
long
hairy
fingers
and
its
single
massive
ring
was
like
the
limb
of
some
prehistoric
creature
philip
brain
and
his
feet
however
were
alike
nimble
he
sprang
a
little
on
one
side
and
though
that
first
blow
caught
him
just
on
the
edge
of
the
shoulder
and
sent
him
spinning
round
and
round
he
saved
himself
by
clutching
at
the
desk
fortunately
it
was
his
left
arm
that
hung
helpless
by
his
side
his
fingers
groped
feverishly
in
the
cavernous
folds
of
his
overcoat
pocket
power
who
had
dashed
against
the
wall
smashing
the
glass
of
one
of
the
pictures

already
recovered
his
balance
and
turned
around
the
little
revolver
with
whose
use
philip
was
barely
acquainted
flashed
suddenly
out
in
the
lamplight
even
in
that
lurid
moment
he
kept
his
nerve
he
aimed
at
the
right
arm
outstretched
to
strike
him
and
pulled
the
trigger
through
the
little
mist
of
smoke
he
saw
a
spasm
of
pain
in
his
assailant
face
felt
the
thundering
crash
of
his
other
arm
striking
him
on
the
side
of
the
head
the
room
spun
round
there
was
a
second
almost
of
unconsciousness
when
he
came
to
he
was
lying
with
his
finger
pressed
against
the
electric
bell
power
was
clutching
the
desk
for
support
and
gasping

of

already
in
the
room
their

turned
to

there
has
been

rang
out
again
in
furious
command

ordered

added
his

little
the
servant
bowed
sombrely

be
obeyed

he
promised
he
took
up
the
telephone
and
signed
to
one
of
the
footmen
who
helped
philip
to
the
door
a
moment
afterwards
the
latter
sank
back
amongst
the
cushions
a
little
dizzy
and
breathless
but
revived
almost
instantly
by
the
cool
night
air
he
gave
the
chauffeur
his
address
and
the
car
glided
through
the
iron
gates
and
down

was
awakened
the
next
morning
by
the
insistent
ringing
of
the

his
elbow

took
up

conscious
of

george
lunt
was

clear

wishes
you
to
know
that
he
will
not
be
in
new
york
until
a
week
how
is
mr
power
philip
enquired
he
met
with
a
slight
accident
last
night
the
voice
continued
and
is
obliged
to
wear
his
arm
in
a
sling
except
for
that
he
is
quite
well
he
has
already
left
for
philadelphia
by
the
early
train
he
was
anxious
that
you
should
know
this
thank
you
very
much
philip
murmured
a
little
dazed
he
sprang
out
of
bed
dressed
quickly
hurried
over
his
coffee
and
rolls
boarded
a
car
and
arrived
at
the
monmouth
house
flats
just
in
time
to
meet
martha
grimes
issuing
into
the
street
she
was
not
at
all
the
same
martha
she
was
very
neatly
dressed
her
shoes
were
nicely
polished
her
clothes
well
brushed
her
gloves
new
and
she
wore
a
bunch
of
violets
in
her
waistband
she
started
in
surprise
as
philip
accosted
her
whatever
are
you
doing
back
in
the
slums
she
demanded
any
fresh
trouble
nothing
particular
philip
replied
turning
round
and
falling
into
step
with
her
i
ca
see
my
way
that
all
and
i
want
to
talk
to
you
you
the
most
human
person
i
know
and
you
understand
elizabeth
gee
she
smiled
this
is
the
lion
and
the
mouse
with
a
vengeance
you
can
walk
with
me
if
you
like
as
far
as
the
block
before
the
theatre
i
not
going
to
arrive
there
with
you
and
i
tell
you
so
straight
no
followers
eh
there
no
reason
to
set
people
talking
she
declared
their
tongues
wag
fast
enough
at
the
theatre
as
it
is
i
only
been
there
for
one
day
work
and
it
seems
to
me
i
heard
the
inside
history
of
every
one
connected
with
the
place
that
makes
what
i
have
to
say
easier
he
remarked
just
what
do
they
say
about
miss
dalstan
and
sylvanus
power
she
looked
at
him
indignantly
if
you
think
you
going
to
worm
things
out
of
me
do
be
foolish
he
interrupted
a
little
wearily
how
could
you
know
anything
you
are
only
the
echo
of
a
thousand
voices
i
could
find
out
if
i
went
where
they
gossip
i
do
in
effect
i
do
care
but
i
am
up
against
a
queer
situation
i
want
to
know
just
what
people
think
of
them
afterwards
i
tell
you
the
truth
well
they
profess
to
think
she
said
slowly
that
the
theatre
belongs
to
miss
dalstan
and
that
she
stop
please
he
interrupted
i
know
you
hate
saying
it
and
i
know
quite
well
what
you
mean
well
what
about
that
it
is
my
affair
it
is
true
he
told
her
whether
it
true
or
not
she
is
one
of
the
best
women
in
the
world
martha
declared
vigorously
there
is
any
doubt
about
that
either
he
assented
this
is
the
situation
listen
sylvanus
power
has
been
in
love
with
elizabeth
for
the
best
part
of
his
life
he
built
that
theatre
for
her
and
offered
it
at
a
price
she
accepted
his
terms
when
the
time
came
for
payment
he
saw
her
flinch
he
went
away
again
and
has
just
come
back
she
is
face
to
face
now
with
a
decision
a
decision
to
which
she
is
partly
committed
in
the
meantime
during
these
last
few
months
elizabeth
and
i
have
become
great
friends
you
know
that
i
care
for
her
i
think
that
she
cares
for
me
she
has
to
make
up
her
mind
martha
which
is
she
to
choose
how
do
you
want
me
to
answer
that
the
girl
asked
slackening
her
pace
a
little
i
not
miss
dalstan
from
her
point
of
view
he
explained
eagerly
this
man
power
is
madly
and
i
believe
truly
in
love
with
her
in
his
way
he
is
great
in
his
way
too
he
is
a
potentate
he
can
give
her
more
than
luxury
more
even
than
success
you
know
elizabeth
he
went
on
she
is
one
of
the
finest
women
who
ever
breathed
an
idealist
but
a
seeker
after
big
things
she
deserves
the
big
things
is
she
more
likely
to
find
them
with
me
or
with
him
power
wife
is
still
alive
she
ruminated
and
wo
accept
a
divorce
at
present
he
observed
if
ever
she
does
of
course
he
will
marry
her
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
not
morally
but
the
temporal
side
of
it
we
know
perfectly
well
that
whatever
elizabeth
decides
she
could
possibly
do
wrong
martha
smiled
a
little
grimly
that
what
it
is
to
be
born
in
the
clouds
she
said
there
is
no
sin
for
a
good
woman
he
looked
at
her
appreciatively
i
wonder
how
i
knew
that
you
would
understand
this
he
sighed
suddenly
he
clutched
at
her
arm
she
glanced
up
in
surprise
he
was
staring
at
a
her
eyes
followed
his
in
a
neat
morning
suit
with
a
black
bowler
hat
and
shoes
a
cigar
in
his
mouth
and
a
general
air
of
prosperity
edward
dane
was
strolling
along
broadway
he
passed
without
a
glance
at
either
of
them
for
a
moment
philip
faltered
then
he
set
his
teeth
and
walked
on
there
was
an
ashen
shade
in
his
face
the
girl
looked
at
him
and
shook
her
head
ware
she
said
we
have
talked
much
about
it
but
there
is
something
there
behind
is
there
something
you
are
terrified
about
something
that
might
come
even
now
she
knows
about
it
he
interposed
quickly
would
it
be
very
bad
if
it
came
hideous
if
she
were
your
wife
she
would
be
notorious
it
would
ruin
her
do
you
think
then
she
asked
quietly
that
you
needed
to
come
and
ask
my
advice
he
walked
on
with
his
head
high
looking
upwards
with
unseeing
eyes
a
little
vista
of
that
undisturbed
supper
table
on
the
other
side
of
the
marble
hall
a
dim
perspective
of
those
eight
years
of
waiting
flitted
through
his
brain
the
lord
of
that
fifth
avenue
mansion
was
in
earnest
right
enough
and
he
had
so
much
to
offer
it
will
break
me
if
i
have
to
give
her
up
he
said
simply
i
believe
i
should
have
gone
overboard
crossing
the
atlantic
but
for
her
there
are
some
women
she
sighed
the
best
of
all
women
the
joy
of
whose
life
seems
to
be
sacrifice
that
sounds
queer
do
it
but
true
they
happy
in
misfortune
so
long
as
they
are
helping
some
one
else
she
is
wonderful
elizabeth
dalstan
she
may
even
be
one
of
those
you
find
that
out
you
better
find
out
for
yourself
there
is
any
one
can
help
you
very
much
i
am
not
sure
that
you
have
he
said
now
i
go
where
did
you
get
your
violets
martha
had
them
in
water
since
last
night
you
she
made
a
little
grimace
at
him
a
very
polite
young
gentleman
at
the
box
office
sent
us
each
a
bunch
directly
we
started
work
yesterday
i
only
had
a
few
words
with
him
yet
but
eva
that
the
other
girl
she
plagued
to
death
with
fellows
already
so
i
going
to
take
him
out
one
evening
philip
stopped
short
they
were
approaching
the
theatre
not
a
step
further
he
declared
solemnly
i
would
spoil
your
prospects
for
worlds
run
along
my
little
cynic
and
warm
your
hands
life
good
at
your
age
better
than
when
i
found
you
eh
you
do
think
i
am
ungrateful
she
asked
a
little
wistfully
he
shook
his
head
you
could
be
that
martha
good
luck
to
you
she
turned
away
with
a
little
farewell
wave
of
the
hand
and
was
lost
at
once
in
the
surging
stream
of
people
philip
summoned
a
taxicab
sat
far
back
in
the
corner
and
drove
to
his
rooms
he
hesitated
for
a
moment
before
getting
out
crossed
the
pavement
quickly
hurried
into
the
lift
and
arriving
let
down
the
latch
of
the
outside
door
edward
dane
was
back
in
new
york
for
a
moment
the
memory
of
the
great
human
drama
in
which
he
found
himself
a
somewhat
pathetic
figure
seemed
swallowed
up
by
this
sudden
resurrection
of
a
grisly
tragedy
he
looked
around
his
room
a
little
helplessly
against
his
will
that
hideous
vision
which
had
loomed
up
before
him
in
so
many
moments
of
depression
was
slowly
reforming
itself
this
time
not
in
the
still
watches
of
the
night
but
in
the
broad
daylight
with
the
spring
sunshine
to
cheer
his
heart
the
roar
of
a
friendly
city
in
his
ears
it
was
no
time
for
dreams
this
and
yet
he
felt
the
misery
sweeping
in
upon
him
felt
all
the
cold
shivers
of
his
ineffective
struggles
slowly
that
fateful
panorama
unfolded
itself
before
his
memory
he
saw
himself
step
out
with
glad
relief
from
the
uncomfortable
nauseous
carriage
and
clutching
his
humble
little
present
in
his
hand
cross
the
flinty
platform
climb
the
long
hill
keeping
his
head
upraised
though
the
very
sky
seemed
grimy
battling
against
the
miserable
depression
of
that
everlasting
ugliness
before
him
at
least
there
was
his
one
companion
there
would
be
kind
words
sympathy
a
cheerful
fireside
a
little
dreaming
a
little
wandering
into
that
world
which
they
had
made
for
themselves
with
the
help
of
such
treasures
as
that
cheap
little
volume
he
carried
and
then
the
last
few
steps
the
open
door
the
room
its
air
at
first
of
wonderful
comfort
and
then
the
queer
note
of
luxury
obtruding
itself
disquietingly
the
picture
on
the
mantelpiece
her
coming
he
had
never
been
in
love
with
beatrice
he
knew
that
now
perfectly
well
he
had
simply
clung
to
her
because
she
was
the
only
living
being
who
knew
and
understood
because
they
had
mingled
their
thoughts
and
trodden
the
path
of
misery
together
removed
now
from
that
blaze
of
passion
smouldering
perhaps
in
him
through
previous
years
of
discontent
but
which
leaped
into
actual
and
effective
life
for
the
first
time
in
those
few
moments
he
realised
a
certain
justice
in
her
point
of
view
a
certain
hard
logic
in
the
way
she
had
spoken
of
life
and
their
relations
there
had
been
so
little
real
affection
between
them
so
little
had
passed
which
might
have
constituted
a
greater
bond
it
was
his
passionate
outburst
of
revolt
against
life
whose
drear
talons
seemed
to
have
fastened
themselves
into
his
very
soul
which
had
sent
him
out
with
murder
in
his
brain
to
seek
the
man
who
had
robbed
him
of
the
one
thing
which
stood
between
him
and
despair
the
fury
of
a
lifetime
which
had
tingled
in
his
blood
and
had
given
him
the
strength
of
the
navvy
in
those
few
minutes
by
the
canal
side
he
covered
his
face
with
his
hands
strode
around
the
room
gazing
wildly
out
over
the
city
trying
to
listen
to
the
clanging
of
the
surface
cars
the
rumble
of
the
overhead
railway
in
the
distance
the
breaking
of
the
long
ceaseless
waves
of
human
feet
upon
the
pavement
it
was
useless
no
effort
of
his
will
could
keep
from
his
brain
the
haunting
memory
of
those
final
moments
the
man
face
handsome
and
at
first
the
careless
greeting
the
sudden
change
the
surprise
the
apprehension
the
ghastly
fear
the
agony
he
heard
the
low
gurgling
shriek
of
terror
he
looked
into
the
eyes
with
the
fear
of
hell
before
them
then
he
heard
the
splash
of
the
black
filthy
water
there
was
a
cry
it
was
several
seconds
before
he
realised
that
it
had
broken
from
his
lips
he
looked
around
him
like
a
hunted
creature
there
was
another
terror
now
the
gloomy
court
with
its
ugly
miserable
paraphernalia
the
death
uglier
still
death
in
disgrace
a
sordid
ghastly
thing
and
in
his
brain
too
there
was
so
much
dawning
so
many
wonderful
ideas
craving
for
fulfilment
these
few
months
had
been
months
of
marvellous
development
the
power
of
the
writer
had
seemed
to
grow
hour
by
hour
his
brain
was
full
of
fancies
exquisite
fancies
some
of
them
it
was
a
new
world
growing
up
around
him
and
within
him
too
beautiful
a
world
to
leave
yet
in
those
breathless
moments
fear
was
the
dominant
sensation
he
felt
a
coward
to
his
fingertips
he
walked
up
and
down
the
room
feverishly
as
a
man
might
pace
a
prison
in
the
first
few
moments
of
captivity
there
was
no
escape
if
he
disappeared
again
it
would
only
rivet
suspicion
the
more
closely
there
was
no
place
to
which
he
could
fly
no
shelter
save
on
the
other
side
of
the
life
which
he
had
just
begun
to
love
his
physical
condition
began
to
alarm
him
he
felt
his
forehead
by
accident
and
found
it
damp
with
sweat
his
heart
was
beating
irregularly
with
a
spasmodic
vigour
which
brought
pain
he
caught
sight
of
his
face
in
the
and
the
craving
to
escape
from
his
frenzied
solitude
overcame
all
his
other
resolutions
he
rushed
to
the
telephone
spoke
with
phoebe
waited
breathlessly
whilst
she
fetched
his
mistress
to
the
instrument
i
want
to
see
you
he
begged
as
soon
as
he
was
conscious
of
her
presence
at
the
other
end
i
want
to
see
you
at
once
has
anything
happened
she
asked
quickly
yes
he
almost
groaned
i
ca
tell
you
i
will
be
with
you
in
ten
minutes
she
promised
he
set
the
receiver
down
those
ten
minutes
were
surely
the
longest
which
had
ever
ticked
their
way
into
eternity
and
then
she
came
he
heard
the
lift
stop
and
his
door
open
there
was
a
moment
breathless
silence
as
their
eyes
met
then
a
little
gathering
together
of
the
lines
of
her
forehead
a
half
querulous
half
sympathetic
smile
she
shook
her
head
at
him
you
had
one
of
those
silly
nervous
attacks
she
declared
tell
me
at
once
why
dane
is
back
i
saw
him
on
the
pavement
this
morning
he
exclaimed
he
has
been
to
england
to
find
out
she
made
him
sit
down
and
seated
herself
by
his
side
listen
she
said
dane
came
back
on
the
the
day
before
yesterday
i
saw
his
name
in
the
paper
if
his
voyage
to
england
had
been
a
success
which
it
could
not
have
been
you
would
have
heard
from
him
before
now
i
did
think
of
that
he
muttered
i
have
never
asked
you
she
went
on
to
tell
me
exactly
what
happened
behind
there
i
do
want
to
know
only
i
have
a
consciousness
i
had
from
the
first
when
you
began
to
talk
to
me
about
it
that
your
fears
were
exaggerated
if
you
have
been
allowed
to
remain
safe
all
this
time
you
will
be
safe
always
i
feel
it
and
i
am
always
right
in
these
things
now
use
your
own
common
sense
tell
me
truthfully
do
you
think
it
is
very
improbable
that
anything
could
be
discovered
that
anything
could
be
proved
he
admitted
eagerly
yes
then
do
be
silly
no
one
is
likely
to
make
accusations
and
attempt
a
case
unless
they
had
a
definite
end
in
view
we
are
safe
even
from
the
people
raymond
greene
has
ceased
to
talk
of
your
wonderful
resemblance
to
douglas
romilly
phoebe
the
only
one
who
could
really
know
will
never
open
her
lips
now
take
me
for
a
little
walk
we
will
look
in
the
shops
in
fifth
avenue
and
lunch
at
the
go
and
brush
yourself
and
make
yourself
look
respectable
i
have
a
cigarette
and
read
the
paper
no
i
wo
i
look
over
these
loose
sheets
and
see
how
you
are
getting
on
he
disappeared
into
his
room
for
a
few
minutes
when
he
returned
she
was
entirely
engrossed
she
looked
up
at
him
with
something
almost
of
reverence
in
her
face
when
did
you
write
this
she
asked
yesterday
most
of
it
he
answered
there
is
more
of
it
i
finished
yet
when
you
send
me
away
this
afternoon
i
shall
go
on
that
is
only
the
beginning
i
have
a
great
idea
dawning
what
you
have
written
is
wonderful
she
said
simply
it
makes
me
feel
almost
humble
makes
me
feel
that
the
very
best
actress
in
the
world
remains
only
an
interpretress
yes
i
can
say
those
words
you
have
written
but
they
can
never
be
mine
i
want
to
be
something
more
than
an
intelligent
parrot
philip
why
ca
you
teach
me
to
feel
and
think
things
like
that
you
he
murmured
as
he
took
her
arm
and
led
her
to
the
door
you
could
feel
all
the
sweetest
and
most
wonderful
things
in
heaven
the
writer
knack
is
only
a
slight
gift
i
put
on
paper
what
lives
in
your
heart
she
raised
her
head
and
he
kissed
her
lips
for
a
moment
he
held
her
quite
quietly
her
arms
encircled
him
the
perfume
of
her
clothes
her
hair
her
warm
gentle
touch
seemed
like
a
strong
sedative
if
she
said
that
he
was
safe
he
must
be
it
was
queer
how
so
often
at
these
times
their
sexes
seemed
reversed
it
was
he
who
felt
that
womanly
desire
for
shelter
and
protection
which
she
so
amply
afforded
him
she
patted
his
cheek
now
for
our
little
walk
she
said
open
the
windows
and
let
out
all
these
bad
fancies
of
yours
and
listen
she
went
on
as
they
stepped
out
of
the
lift
a
moment
or
two
later
and
passed
through
the
hall
towards
the
pavement
not
a
word
about
our
own
problem
we
are
going
to
talk
nonsense
we
are
going
to
be
just
two
children
in
this
wonderful
city
gazing
at
the
sights
and
taking
all
she
has
to
offer
us
i
love
it
you
know
i
love
the
noise
of
it
it
is
a
distant
stifled
roar
like
london
there
a
harsh
note
about
it
like
metal
striking
upon
metal
and
the
smell
of
new
york
there
is
any
other
city
like
it
when
we
get
into
fifth
avenue
i
am
going
to
direct
your
attention
to
the
subject
of
hats
have
you
ever
bought
a
woman
hat
philip
never
he
answered
truthfully
enough
then
you
are
going
to
this
morning
or
rather
you
are
going
to
help
me
to
choose
one
she
declared
and
in
a
very
few
moments
too
there
is
a
little
place
almost
underground
in
fifth
avenue
there
and
a
frenchwoman
oh
she
is
so
french
and
all
her
assistants
have
black
hair
and
wear
untidy
shapeless
clothes
and
velvet
slippers
it
is
new
york
at
all
but
i
love
it
and
i
let
them
put
their
name
on
the
programme
they
really
do
charge
me
more
than
twice
as
much
as
they
ought
to
for
my
hats
we
go
down
here
she
added
descending
some
steps
and
if
you
make
eyes
at
any
of
the
young
women
i
shall
bring
you
straight
out
again
they
spent
half
an
hour
choosing
a
hat
and
nearly
two
hours
over
lunch
it
was
late
in
the
afternoon
before
she
dropped
him
at
his
rooms
not
a
word
had
they
spoken
of
sylvanus
power
or
their
future
but
philip
was
a
different
man
only
as
he
turned
and
said
his
voice
trembled
i
ca
say
thank
you
he
muttered
but
you
know
the
lift
was
too
slow
for
him
he
opened
his
door
with
almost
breathless
haste
he
only
paused
to
light
a
cigarette
and
change
his
coat
and
wheel
his
table
round
so
as
to
catch
the
afternoon
light
more
perfectly
then
with
his
brain
teeming
with
fancies
he
plunged
into
his
work
chapter
xii
philip
let
the
pen
slip
at
last
from
his
tired
fingers
the
light
had
failed
he
had
been
writing
with
straining
eyes
almost
in
the
darkness
but
there
was
something
else
had
it
been
fancy
or
this
time
there
could
be
no
mistake
he
had
not
heard
the
lift
stop
but
some
one
was
knocking
softly
at
the
door
softly
but
persistently
he
turned
his
head
the
room
seemed
filled
with
shadows
he
had
written
for
hours
and
he
was
conscious
that
his
limbs
were
stiff
the
sun
had
gone
down
in
a
cloudy
sky
and
the
light
had
faded
he
could
scarcely
distinguish
the
articles
of
furniture
at
the
further
end
of
the
room
for
some
reason
or
other
he
felt
then
without
any
answer
from
him
to
this
mysterious
summons
the
handle
of
the
door
slowly
turned
as
he
sat
there
he
saw
it
pushed
open
a
woman
wrapped
in
a
long
coat
stepped
inside
closing
it
firmly
behind
her
she
stood
peering
around
the
room
there
was
something
familiar
and
yet
unfamiliar
in
her
height
her
carriage
he
waited
spellbound
for
her
voice
douglas
she
exclaimed
ah
there
you
are
the
words
seemed
to
die
away
unuttered
upon
his
lips
he
suddenly
thought
that
he
was
choking
he
stared
at
her
blankly
it
was
impossible
she
came
a
step
further
into
the
room
her
hand
was
stretched
out
accusingly
so
i
found
you
have
i
douglas
she
cried
and
there
was
a
note
of
bitter
triumph
in
her
words
found
you
after
all
these
months
you
terrified
are
you
afraid
no
wonder
you
sit
there
shrinking
away
do
you
know
what
i
have
come
for
he
tried
to
speak
but
his
lips
were
as
powerless
to
frame
words
as
his
limbs
were
to
respond
to
his
desire
for
movement
this
was
the
one
thing
which
he
had
not
foreseen
you
broke
your
promise
she
went
on
raising
her
voice
a
little
in
passionate
reproach
you
left
me
there
alone
to
face
dismissal
without
a
penny
and
slipped
off
yourself
to
america
you
never
even
came
in
to
wish
me
why
tell
me
why
you
went
without
coming
near
me
you
wo
eh
you
dare
be
a
man
out
with
it
i
am
here
and
i
know
the
truth
for
the
first
time
some
definite
sound
came
from
his
lips
beatrice
he
gasped
ah
she
mocked
you
can
remember
my
name
then
douglas
i
knew
that
you
were
a
bad
man
i
knew
that
when
you
told
me
how
you
meant
to
cheat
your
creditors
how
you
meant
to
escape
over
here
on
the
pretext
of
business
and
bring
all
the
money
you
could
scrape
together
i
knew
that
and
yet
i
was
willing
to
come
with
you
and
i
should
have
come
but
there
was
one
thing
i
did
reckon
upon
i
did
know
that
you
had
the
heart
or
the
courage
to
be
a
murderer
the
little
cry
that
broke
from
his
lips
was
stifled
even
before
it
was
uttered
i
shall
never
forgive
you
she
sobbed
i
never
want
to
touch
your
bloodstained
fingers
i
have
forgotten
that
i
ever
loved
you
horrible
do
you
hear
horrible
and
yet
i
do
mean
to
be
left
to
starve
that
why
i
followed
you
you
afraid
i
am
going
to
give
you
up
to
justice
well
i
do
know
it
depends
turn
on
the
lights
i
want
to
see
you
do
you
hear
i
want
to
see
how
you
can
face
me
i
want
to
see
how
the
memory
of
that
afternoon
has
dealt
with
you
do
as
i
tell
you
do
stand
there
glowering
at
me
he
crossed
the
room
with
stumbling
footsteps
you
learnt
to
stoop
anyhow
she
went
on
you
thinner
too
my
god
the
room
was
suddenly
flooded
with
light
philip
rigid
and
ghastly
was
looking
at
her
from
the
other
side
of
the
table
she
held
up
her
hands
as
though
to
shut
out
the
sight
of
him
philip
she
shrieked
philip
oh
my
god
her
eyes
were
lit
with
horror
as
she
swayed
upon
her
feet
for
a
moment
she
seemed
about
to
collapse
then
she
groped
her
way
towards
the
door
and
stood
there
clinging
to
the
handle
slowly
she
looked
around
over
her
shoulder
her
face
as
white
as
death
she
moistened
her
lips
with
her
tongue
her
eyes
glared
at
him
behind
her
brain
seemed
to
be
working
her
first
spasm
of
inarticulate
fear
passed
philip
she
muttered
alive
speak
ca
you
speak
to
me
are
you
a
ghost
of
course
not
he
answered
with
a
calm
which
surprised
him
you
have
forgotten
in
less
than
six
months
what
i
look
like
a
new
expression
struggled
into
her
face
she
abandoned
her
grasp
of
the
handle
and
came
back
to
her
former
position
look
here
she
faltered
if
you
are
philip
romilly
he
douglas
where
douglas
there
was
no
answer
philip
simply
looked
at
her
she
began
to
shake
once
more
upon
her
feet
where
douglas
she
demanded
fiercely
tell
me
tell
me
quickly
before
i
go
mad
if
you
are
philip
romilly
alive
if
it
was
your
body
they
found
where
douglas
you
can
guess
what
happened
to
him
philip
said
slowly
i
met
him
on
the
by
the
side
of
the
canal
i
spoke
to
him
about
you
he
answered
me
with
a
jest
i
think
that
all
the
passion
of
those
grinding
years
of
misery
swept
up
at
that
moment
from
my
heart
i
was
strong
god
how
strong
i
was
i
took
him
by
the
throat
beatrice
i
watched
his
face
change
i
watched
his
damned
complacency
fade
away
he
lost
all
his
smugness
and
his
eyes
began
to
stare
at
me
and
his
lips
grew
whiter
as
they
struggled
to
utter
the
cries
for
mercy
which
choked
back
then
i
flung
him
in
that
all
splash
god
i
can
hear
it
now
i
saw
his
face
just
under
the
water
then
i
went
on
you
went
on
she
repeated
trembling
in
every
limb
i
picked
up
the
pocketbook
which
i
had
shaken
out
of
his
clothes
in
that
first
struggle
i
studied
its
contents
and
it
gave
me
an
idea
i
went
to
liverpool
stayed
at
the
hotel
where
he
had
engaged
rooms
dressed
myself
in
his
clothes
and
went
on
the
steamer
in
his
place
i
travelled
to
new
york
as
douglas
romilly
of
the
douglas
romilly
shoe
company
occupied
my
room
at
the
waldorf
under
that
name
then
i
disappeared
suddenly
there
were
too
many
people
waiting
to
see
me
i
took
the
pseudonym
which
he
had
carefully
prepared
for
himself
and
hid
for
a
time
in
a
small
tenement
house
then
i
rewrote
the
play
there
you
have
my
story
you
murdered
him
philip
you
it
was
no
crime
he
continued
calmly
filled
with
a
queer
sense
of
relief
at
the
idea
of
being
able
to
talk
about
it
my
whole
life
up
till
that
day
had
been
one
epitome
of
injustice
and
evil
fortune
you
were
my
one
solace
his
life
well
you
know
what
it
had
been
everything
was
made
easy
for
him
he
had
a
luxurious
boyhood
he
was
sent
to
college
pampered
and
spoilt
and
passed
on
to
a
dissipated
manhood
he
spent
a
great
fortune
ruined
a
magnificent
business
he
lived
month
by
month
hour
by
hour
for
just
the
voluptuous
pleasures
which
his
wealth
made
possible
to
him
that
was
the
man
i
met
on
the
canal
bank
that
afternoon
you
know
the
state
i
was
in
you
know
very
well
the
grievance
i
had
against
him
you
had
no
right
to
interfere
she
said
dully
if
i
chose
to
accept
what
he
had
to
give
it
was
my
business
there
never
had
been
affection
between
you
and
me
we
were
just
waifs
together
life
give
us
what
we
wanted
i
had
made
up
my
mind
months
before
to
escape
whenever
the
opportunity
came
douglas
brought
it
to
me
and
i
snatched
at
it
i
am
not
accepting
any
blame
he
leaned
towards
her
neither
am
i
he
declared
do
you
remember
we
used
to
talk
about
the
doctrine
of
responsibility
i
am
a
pervert
i
did
what
i
had
to
do
and
i
am
content
she
stood
quite
still
for
several
moments
then
she
took
out
the
pins
from
her
hat
banged
it
upon
the
table
opened
her
tweed
coat
came
round
to
the
fireside
and
threw
herself
into
an
her
action
was
portentous
and
significant
tell
me
how
you
found
me
out
he
asked
after
a
brief
pause
i
was
dismissed
from
detton
magna
she
told
him
i
had
to
go
and
be
to
aunt
esther
at
croydon
i
took
the
place
of
her
i
scrubbed
for
my
living
there
was
anything
else
i
had
clothes
to
try
for
the
bolder
things
not
a
friend
in
the
world
but
i
was
only
waiting
i
meant
at
the
first
chance
to
rob
aunt
esther
to
come
to
london
dress
myself
properly
and
find
a
post
on
the
stage
if
possible
i
was
particular
then
one
day
a
man
came
to
see
me
an
american
he
travelled
all
the
way
from
new
york
because
he
was
interested
in
what
he
called
the
mysterious
romilly
disappearance
he
knew
that
i
had
been
douglas
friend
he
asked
me
to
come
out
and
identify
you
he
offered
me
my
passage
a
hundred
pounds
and
to
give
me
a
start
in
life
here
if
i
needed
it
so
i
came
out
with
him
with
dane
he
muttered
she
nodded
yes
that
was
his
name
edward
dane
i
came
out
to
identify
douglas
you
were
going
to
give
him
away
philip
asked
curiously
of
course
not
i
should
have
made
my
bargain
and
then
after
i
had
scared
douglas
for
leaving
me
as
he
did
i
should
have
said
that
it
was
the
man
and
instead
i
found
you
he
tapped
the
table
with
his
fingers
restlessly
a
new
hope
was
forming
in
his
brain
this
indeed
might
be
the
end
of
all
his
troubles
listen
he
said
earnestly
dane
has
always
suspected
me
sometimes
i
have
wondered
whether
he
had
the
truth
at
the
back
of
his
head
you
can
make
me
safe
forever
she
made
no
reply
her
eyes
were
watching
his
face
she
seemed
to
be
waiting
to
hear
what
else
he
had
to
say
do
you
understand
he
went
on
impatiently
you
have
only
to
tell
dane
that
i
am
neither
douglas
nor
philip
but
curiously
like
both
and
he
will
chuck
the
thing
up
he
must
then
i
shall
be
safe
you
see
that
do
you
yes
i
see
that
she
admitted
well
tell
me
exactly
how
much
of
douglas
money
you
have
spent
she
demanded
only
the
loose
money
from
the
pocketbook
not
all
of
that
i
am
earning
money
now
she
leaned
across
the
table
what
about
the
twenty
thousand
pounds
i
have
touched
it
he
assured
her
not
a
penny
on
your
honour
he
rose
silently
and
went
to
his
desk
unlocked
one
of
the
drawers
and
drew
from
a
hidden
place
a
thin
strip
of
paper
he
smoothed
it
out
on
the
table
before
her
there
the
deposit
note
he
said
thousand
pounds
to
the
joint
or
separate
credit
of
beatrice
wenderley
and
douglas
romilly
on
the
money
there
still
i
have
touched
it
she
gripped
the
paper
in
her
fingers
the
sight
of
the
figures
seemed
to
fascinate
her
then
she
looked
around
how
can
you
afford
to
live
in
a
place
like
this
then
she
demanded
suspiciously
where
does
your
money
come
from
the
play
he
told
her
what
all
this
she
exclaimed
it
is
a
great
success
the
theatre
is
packed
every
night
my
royalties
come
every
week
to
far
more
than
i
could
spend
she
looked
once
more
around
her
gripped
the
deposit
note
in
her
fingers
and
leaned
back
in
her
chair
she
laughed
curiously
her
eyes
had
travelled
back
to
philip
anxious
face
wonderful
she
murmured
you
paid
the
price
but
you
won
had
something
for
it
i
paid
the
price
and
up
till
now
she
stared
at
the
paper
in
her
hand
then
she
looked
away
into
the
fire
i
ca
get
it
all
into
my
head
she
went
on
i
pictured
him
here
living
in
luxury
spending
the
money
of
which
he
had
promised
me
a
share
and
he
dead
that
was
his
body
that
unrecognisable
thing
they
found
in
the
canal
you
killed
him
douglas
he
was
so
fond
of
life
too
fond
of
the
things
which
meant
life
to
him
philip
muttered
i
should
never
have
believed
that
you
had
the
courage
she
observed
ruminatingly
after
all
then
he
was
faithless
he
was
the
brute
i
thought
him
she
sat
thinking
for
what
seemed
to
him
to
be
an
interminable
time
he
broke
in
at
last
upon
her
meditations
well
he
asked
what
are
you
going
to
say
to
dane
i
sha
give
you
away
at
least
i
do
think
so
she
promised
cautiously
i
shall
see
presently
i
will
make
terms
only
this
time
i
am
not
going
to
be
left
i
am
going
to
have
what
i
want
but
he
be
waiting
to
hear
from
you
philip
exclaimed
he
may
come
here
even
she
shook
her
head
he
gone
to
chicago
he
ca
be
back
for
five
days
i
promised
to
wire
but
i
sha
i
wait
until
he
back
and
in
the
meantime
her
fingers
closed
upon
the
deposit
note
he
nodded
shortly
that
yours
he
said
you
can
have
it
all
i
have
helped
myself
to
a
fresh
start
in
life
at
his
expense
that
all
i
wanted
she
folded
up
the
paper
and
thrust
it
carefully
into
the
bosom
of
her
gown
then
she
stood
up
well
she
pronounced
i
think
i
am
getting
used
to
things
wonderful
how
callous
one
can
become
the
banks
are
closed
now
i
suppose
he
nodded
they
will
be
open
at
nine
in
the
morning
first
of
all
then
she
decided
i
make
sure
of
my
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
then
we
see
i
do
think
you
find
me
hard
philip
i
ought
not
to
be
hard
on
you
ought
i
she
looked
at
him
most
kindly
and
he
began
to
shiver
curiously
enough
her
very
kindness
when
he
realised
the
knowledge
which
lay
behind
her
brain
was
hateful
to
him
he
had
pleaded
for
her
forgiveness
even
her
toleration
but
anything
else
seemed
horrible
she
strolled
across
the
room
and
glanced
at
the
clock
took
one
of
his
cigarettes
from
a
box
and
lit
it
well
this
is
queer
she
murmured
reflectively
now
i
want
some
dinner
and
i
see
your
play
philip
you
shall
take
me
get
ready
quickly
please
he
looked
at
her
doubtfully
but
beatrice
he
protested
think
you
know
why
you
came
here
you
know
the
story
you
will
have
to
tell
we
are
strangers
you
and
i
what
if
we
are
seen
together
she
snapped
her
fingers
at
him
pooh
who
cares
i
am
a
stranger
in
new
york
and
i
have
taken
a
fancy
to
you
you
are
a
young
man
of
gallantry
and
you
are
going
to
take
me
out
we
often
used
to
talk
of
a
little
excursion
like
this
in
london
we
have
it
in
new
york
instead
he
turned
slowly
towards
the
door
of
his
bedroom
she
was
busy
looking
at
her
own
eyes
in
the
mirror
and
she
missed
the
little
gleam
of
horror
in
his
face
in
ten
minutes
he
promised
her
chapter
xiii
beatrice
replaced
the
programme
which
she
had
been
studying
on
the
ledge
of
the
box
and
turned
towards
philip
who
was
seated
in
the
background
there
was
something
a
little
new
in
her
manner
her
tone
was
subdued
her
eyes
curious
you
really
are
a
wonderful
person
philip
she
declared
it
the
same
play
just
as
you
used
to
tell
it
me
word
for
word
and
yet
it
is
what
is
it
that
you
have
gained
i
wonder
a
sense
of
atmosphere
breadth
something
strangely
vital
i
am
glad
you
like
it
he
said
simply
like
it
it
amazing
and
what
an
audience
i
never
thought
that
the
people
were
so
fashionable
here
philip
i
am
sitting
right
back
in
the
box
but
ten
minutes
after
i
have
cashed
my
draft
tomorrow
i
shall
be
buying
clothes
you
wo
be
ashamed
to
be
seen
anywhere
with
me
then
he
drew
his
chair
up
to
her
side
a
little
haggard
and
worn
with
the
suspense
of
the
evening
she
laughed
at
him
mockingly
what
an
idiot
you
are
she
exclaimed
you
ought
to
be
one
of
the
happiest
men
in
the
world
and
you
look
like
a
the
happiest
man
in
the
world
he
repeated
beatrice
sometimes
i
think
that
there
is
only
one
thing
in
the
world
that
makes
for
happiness
and
what
that
booby
she
asked
with
some
of
her
old
familiarity
a
clear
conscience
she
laid
her
hand
upon
his
arm
look
here
philip
she
said
the
one
thing
i
determined
when
i
threw
up
the
sponge
was
that
whether
the
venture
was
a
success
or
not
never
waste
a
single
moment
in
regrets
things
did
turn
out
too
brilliantly
with
me
as
you
know
but
you
see
what
you
attained
why
it
wonderful
your
play
the
one
thing
you
dreamed
about
produced
in
one
of
the
greatest
cities
in
the
world
and
a
packed
house
to
listen
to
it
people
applauding
all
the
time
i
did
realise
your
success
when
we
talked
this
evening
i
am
just
beginning
to
understand
i
been
reading
some
of
these
extracts
from
the
newspapers
you
merton
ware
the
great
dramatist
the
coming
man
of
letters
you
won
philip
ca
you
see
that
it
puling
cowardice
to
grumble
at
the
price
he
for
his
part
was
wondering
at
her
callousness
of
which
he
was
constantly
discovering
fresh
evidences
the
whole
shock
of
her
discovery
seemed
already
in
these
few
hours
to
have
passed
away
if
you
can
forget
so
soon
he
muttered
i
suppose
i
ought
to
be
able
to
she
made
a
little
grimace
but
immediately
afterwards
he
saw
the
cold
tightening
of
her
lips
listen
philip
she
said
i
started
life
with
the
usual
quiverful
of
good
qualities
but
there
one
i
lost
and
i
do
want
it
back
again
i
a
selfish
woman
and
i
mean
to
stay
a
selfish
woman
i
am
going
to
live
for
myself
i
paid
a
fair
price
and
i
going
to
have
what
i
paid
for
see
do
you
think
he
asked
that
it
is
possible
to
make
that
sort
of
bargain
with
one
self
and
fate
she
laughed
scornfully
there
room
for
a
little
stiffening
in
you
even
now
philip
no
one
but
a
weakling
ever
talks
about
fate
you
think
better
of
me
i
suppose
if
i
stayed
in
my
room
and
wept
well
i
could
do
it
if
i
let
myself
but
i
wo
i
should
lose
several
hours
of
the
life
that
belongs
to
me
you
think
i
did
care
about
douglas
i
am
not
at
all
sure
that
i
did
care
for
him
as
much
as
i
ever
did
for
you
although
of
course
he
was
worthy
of
it
but
he
gone
and
all
the
shudders
and
morbid
regrets
in
the
world
wo
bring
him
back
again
and
i
am
here
in
new
york
and
i
shall
have
twenty
thousand
pounds
and
i
am
with
you
watching
your
play
that
life
enough
for
me
at
present
no
more
no
less
i
hate
missing
the
first
act
and
i
coming
to
see
it
again
what
time
is
it
over
soon
after
eleven
he
told
her
she
glanced
at
her
watch
you
shall
take
me
out
and
give
me
some
supper
she
decided
somewhere
where
there
music
he
made
no
remark
but
she
surprised
again
something
in
his
face
which
irritated
her
look
here
philip
she
said
firmly
i
wo
have
you
look
at
me
as
though
i
were
something
inhuman
there
are
plenty
of
other
women
like
me
in
the
world
even
if
they
are
not
quite
so
frank
about
it
i
want
to
live
and
i
will
live
and
i
grudge
every
moment
out
of
which
i
am
not
extracting
the
fullest
amount
of
happiness
that
because
i
paid
it
the
woman
bargaining
instinct
you
know
she
wants
to
get
value
now
i
want
to
hear
about
miss
dalstan
where
did
you
meet
her
and
how
did
you
get
her
to
accept
your
play
she
was
on
the
he
explained
we
crossed
from
liverpool
together
she
sat
at
my
table
how
much
does
she
know
about
you
beatrice
asked
bluntly
everything
he
confessed
i
do
know
what
i
should
have
done
without
her
she
has
been
the
most
wonderful
friend
any
one
could
have
beatrice
looked
at
him
a
little
critically
you
a
queer
person
philip
she
exclaimed
you
not
fit
to
go
about
alone
really
good
thing
i
came
over
to
take
care
of
you
i
think
you
do
understand
he
replied
miss
dalstan
is
well
unlike
anybody
else
she
wants
to
see
you
i
am
to
take
you
round
after
the
next
act
if
you
would
like
to
go
beatrice
smiled
at
him
in
a
gratified
manner
i
always
wanted
to
go
behind
the
scenes
she
admitted
i
come
with
you
with
pleasure
perhaps
if
i
decide
that
i
like
to
go
on
the
stage
she
may
be
able
to
help
me
how
much
is
twenty
thousand
pounds
in
dollars
philip
a
little
over
a
hundred
thousand
he
told
her
i
do
suppose
they
think
that
much
out
here
she
went
on
ruminatingly
the
hotel
where
dane
sent
me
it
nice
enough
in
its
way
but
very
stuffy
as
regards
the
people
is
twice
as
expensive
as
it
would
be
in
london
however
we
shall
see
the
curtain
rang
up
on
the
third
act
and
beatrice
seated
well
back
in
the
shadows
followed
the
play
attentively
appreciated
its
good
points
and
had
every
appearance
of
both
understanding
and
enjoying
it
afterwards
she
rose
promptly
to
her
feet
still
clapping
i
longing
to
meet
miss
dalstan
philip
she
declared
she
is
wonderful
and
to
think
that
you
wrote
it
that
you
created
the
part
for
her
i
am
really
quite
proud
of
you
she
laughed
at
his
embarrassment
affecting
to
ignore
the
fact
that
it
was
less
the
author
modesty
than
some
queer
impulse
of
horror
which
seemed
to
come
over
him
when
any
action
of
hers
reminded
him
of
their
past
familiarity
he
hurried
on
piloting
her
down
the
corridor
to
the
door
of
elizabeth
dressing
room
in
response
to
his
knock
they
were
bidden
to
enter
and
elizabeth
who
was
lying
on
a
couch
whilst
a
maid
was
busy
preparing
her
costume
for
the
next
act
held
out
her
hand
with
a
little
welcoming
smile
i
am
so
glad
to
see
you
miss
wenderley
she
said
cordially
philip
bring
miss
wenderley
over
here
you
forgive
my
not
getting
up
you
i
have
to
rest
for
just
these
few
minutes
before
the
next
act
beatrice
was
for
a
moment
overpowered
the
luxury
of
the
wonderful
dressing
room
with
its
perfect
french
furniture
its
white
walls
hung
with
a
few
choice
sketches
the
thick
rugs
upon
the
polished
wood
floor
the
exquisite
toilet
table
with
its
wealth
of
gold
and
tortoiseshell
appurtenances
elizabeth
herself
so
beautiful
and
gracious
even
a
hurried
contemplation
of
all
these
things
took
her
breath
away
she
felt
suddenly
acutely
conscious
of
the
poverty
of
her
travelling
clothes
of
her
own
insignificance
wo
you
sit
down
for
a
moment
elizabeth
begged
pointing
to
a
chair
by
her
side
you
and
i
must
be
friends
you
know
for
philip
sake
beatrice
recovered
herself
a
little
she
sank
into
the
blue
satin
chair
with
its
ample
cushions
and
looked
down
at
elizabeth
with
something
very
much
like
awe
i
am
sure
philip
must
feel
very
grateful
to
you
for
having
taken
his
play
she
declared
it
has
given
him
a
fresh
chance
in
life
after
all
he
has
gone
through
elizabeth
said
gently
he
certainly
deserves
it
it
is
a
wonderfully
clever
play
you
know
do
blush
mr
author
i
heard
the
story
long
ago
beatrice
observed
only
of
course
it
sounded
very
differently
then
and
we
never
dreamed
that
it
would
really
be
produced
philip
has
told
me
about
those
days
elizabeth
said
i
am
afraid
that
you
too
have
had
your
share
of
unhappiness
miss
wenderley
i
only
hope
that
life
in
the
future
will
make
up
to
you
something
of
what
you
have
lost
the
girl
face
hardened
her
lips
came
together
in
familiar
fashion
i
mean
it
to
she
declared
i
am
going
to
make
a
start
i
wish
miss
dalstan
you
could
get
philip
to
look
at
things
a
little
more
cheerfully
he
has
been
like
a
ghost
ever
since
i
arrived
elizabeth
turned
and
smiled
at
him
sympathetically
your
coming
must
have
been
rather
a
shock
she
reminded
beatrice
you
came
with
the
idea
did
you
not
that
you
would
find
douglas
romilly
the
girl
nodded
and
glanced
around
for
the
maid
who
had
disappeared
however
into
an
inner
apartment
they
were
always
alike
she
confided
the
same
figures
same
shaped
head
and
that
sort
of
thing
douglas
was
a
little
overfond
of
life
though
and
philip
here
has
found
out
yet
what
it
means
it
was
a
shock
though
miss
dalstan
philip
was
sitting
in
the
dark
when
i
arrived
at
his
rooms
this
evening
and
i
thought
it
was
douglas
elizabeth
shivered
a
little
do
let
us
talk
about
it
she
begged
you
must
come
and
see
me
wo
you
miss
wenderley
philip
will
tell
you
where
i
live
are
you
going
back
to
england
at
once
i
have
made
up
my
mind
yet
the
girl
replied
with
a
slight
frown
it
just
depends
elizabeth
glanced
at
the
little
clock
upon
her
table
and
philip
threw
away
his
cigarette
and
came
forward
we
must
go
beatrice
he
announced
miss
dalstan
has
to
change
her
dress
for
this
act
he
held
out
his
hand
and
elizabeth
rose
lightly
to
her
feet
so
far
no
word
as
to
their
two
selves
had
passed
their
lips
she
smiled
at
him
and
all
this
sense
of
throbbing
almost
theatrical
excitement
subsided
he
was
once
more
conscious
of
the
beautiful
things
beyond
once
more
he
felt
the
rest
of
her
presence
you
must
let
me
see
something
of
you
tomorrow
philip
she
said
telephone
will
you
good
night
miss
wenderley
the
maid
who
had
just
returned
held
the
door
open
philip
glanced
back
over
his
shoulder
elizabeth
blew
him
a
kiss
a
gesture
which
curiously
enough
brought
a
frown
to
beatrice
face
chapter
xiv
the
close
of
the
performance
left
them
both
curiously
they
waited
until
the
theatre
was
half
empty
before
they
left
their
seats
then
they
joined
the
little
throng
of
stragglers
at
the
end
your
play
she
murmured
as
they
faced
the
soft
night
air
i
believe
it
even
now
we
seen
it
together
your
play
and
this
is
new
york
that
a
new
ending
is
it
absolutely
he
confessed
the
ending
was
always
what
bothered
me
you
know
she
laughed
not
quite
naturally
she
was
unexpectedly
impressed
so
you
a
genius
after
all
she
went
on
sometimes
i
wondered
but
never
mind
that
now
philip
do
you
know
i
am
starving
we
took
exactly
ten
minutes
over
dinner
he
led
her
to
a
huge
restaurant
a
few
doors
away
where
they
found
a
corner
table
up
in
the
balcony
an
orchestra
was
playing
light
music
and
a
little
crowd
of
people
were
all
the
time
streaming
through
the
doors
beatrice
settled
herself
down
with
an
air
of
content
few
of
the
people
were
in
evening
dress
and
the
tone
of
the
place
was
essentially
democratic
philip
who
had
learnt
a
little
about
american
dishes
gave
an
order
and
beatrice
sipped
her
cocktail
with
an
air
of
growing
appreciation
queer
idea
this
but
the
stuff
tastes
all
right
she
acknowledged
i
suppose
if
you
were
taking
your
dear
miss
dalstan
out
you
go
to
a
different
sort
of
place
eh
we
generally
go
further
up
town
he
admitted
unthinkingly
she
set
her
glass
down
quickly
so
you
do
take
her
out
do
you
she
asked
coldly
you
have
been
with
her
perhaps
if
i
had
been
here
very
likely
she
was
half
inclined
to
rally
him
behind
it
all
a
little
annoyed
you
a
nice
sort
of
person
why
it
only
a
few
months
ago
since
you
pretended
to
be
in
love
with
me
he
looked
at
her
and
her
eyes
fell
before
his
i
do
think
there
was
ever
much
question
of
our
being
in
love
with
one
another
was
there
we
simply
seemed
to
have
drifted
together
because
we
were
both
miserable
and
then
as
the
time
passed
on
well
you
came
to
be
my
only
solace
against
the
wretchedness
of
that
life
she
nodded
appreciatively
for
a
moment
the
sights
and
sounds
of
the
noisy
restaurant
passed
from
her
consciousness
do
you
remember
how
glad
i
was
to
see
you
how
we
used
to
spend
our
holidays
out
in
those
dingy
fields
and
hope
and
pray
for
better
things
some
day
but
it
was
all
so
hopeless
was
it
you
could
barely
keep
yourself
from
starving
and
i
oh
the
misery
of
that
awful
detton
magna
and
teaching
those
wretched
children
there
never
were
such
children
in
the
world
i
could
get
their
mothers
to
send
them
clean
they
seemed
to
have
inherited
all
the
vice
the
bad
language
the
ugly
sordidness
with
which
the
place
reeked
they
were
old
men
and
women
in
wickedness
before
they
passed
their
first
standard
it
a
corner
of
the
world
i
never
want
to
see
again
i
rather
find
hell
have
you
ordered
any
wine
philip
i
want
to
forget
he
pointed
to
the
bottle
which
stood
in
the
pail
by
their
side
and
summoned
a
waiter
she
watched
it
being
opened
and
their
glasses
filled
this
is
like
one
of
our
fairy
stories
of
the
old
days
is
it
she
said
well
i
drink
to
you
philip
here
success
to
our
new
lives
she
raised
her
glass
and
drained
it
a
woman
had
entered
who
reminded
him
of
elizabeth
and
his
eyes
had
wandered
away
for
a
moment
as
beatrice
pledged
him
she
called
him
back
a
little
impatiently
do
sit
there
as
though
you
were
looking
at
ghosts
philip
try
and
remember
who
i
am
and
what
we
used
to
mean
to
one
another
let
us
try
and
believe
she
added
a
little
wistfully
that
one
of
those
dreams
of
ours
which
we
used
to
set
floating
like
bubbles
has
come
true
we
can
wipe
out
all
the
memories
we
do
want
that
ought
to
be
easy
ought
it
he
answered
grimly
there
are
times
when
i
found
it
difficult
enough
she
laughed
and
looked
about
her
he
realised
suddenly
that
she
was
still
very
attractive
with
her
rather
insolent
mouth
her
clear
eyes
her
silky
hair
with
the
little
fringe
people
as
they
passed
paid
her
some
attention
and
she
was
frankly
curious
about
everybody
well
she
went
on
presently
thank
heavens
i
have
plenty
of
will
power
i
remember
nothing
absolutely
nothing
which
happened
before
this
evening
i
am
going
to
tell
myself
that
an
uncle
in
australia
has
died
and
left
me
money
and
so
we
are
here
in
new
york
to
spend
it
i
am
going
to
begin
i
shall
buy
clothes
all
sorts
of
clothes
and
hats
you
wo
know
me
evening
philip
his
heart
sank
evening
but
beatrice
he
expostulated
you
do
think
of
staying
out
here
do
you
you
do
know
a
soul
you
have
a
friend
in
the
city
what
friends
have
i
in
england
she
retorted
not
one
i
may
just
as
well
start
a
new
life
in
a
new
country
it
seems
bright
enough
here
and
gay
i
like
it
i
shall
move
to
a
different
sort
of
hotel
you
must
help
me
choose
one
and
as
to
friends
she
whispered
looking
up
at
him
with
a
little
provocative
gleam
in
her
eyes
do
you
count
you
do
what
i
am
going
to
do
philip
ca
you
draw
down
that
curtain
he
shivered
i
ca
he
muttered
a
waiter
brought
their
first
course
and
she
at
once
evinced
interest
in
her
food
she
returned
to
the
subject
however
later
on
after
she
had
drunk
another
glass
of
wine
you
a
silly
old
thing
you
know
she
declared
you
found
the
courage
somehow
to
break
away
from
that
loathsome
existence
you
had
more
courage
even
than
i
because
you
ran
a
risk
i
never
did
but
here
you
are
free
with
the
whole
world
before
you
and
your
last
danger
disappearing
with
the
knowledge
that
i
am
ready
to
be
your
friend
and
am
sensible
about
everything
that
has
happened
this
ought
to
be
an
immense
relief
to
you
philip
you
ought
to
be
the
happiest
man
on
earth
and
there
you
sit
looking
like
a
look
at
me
for
a
moment
like
a
human
being
ca
you
drink
some
more
wine
there
must
be
some
strength
some
manhood
about
you
somewhere
or
you
could
have
done
what
you
have
done
he
filled
his
glass
mechanically
she
leaned
across
the
table
her
eyes
were
bright
her
cheeks
delicately
pink
courage
philip
she
murmured
remember
that
what
you
did
well
in
a
way
it
was
for
my
sake
was
it
for
love
of
me
i
am
here
now
and
we
are
both
free
the
old
days
are
passed
even
their
shadow
can
not
trouble
us
any
longer
do
be
a
sentimentalist
listen
and
i
tell
you
something
at
the
bottom
of
my
heart
i
rather
admire
you
for
what
you
did
do
you
want
your
reward
no
he
answered
firmly
i
do
she
shrugged
her
shoulders
and
kept
time
with
her
foot
to
the
music
across
the
table
although
she
kept
silence
for
a
while
she
smiled
at
him
whenever
she
caught
his
eye
she
was
not
angry
not
even
hurt
philip
had
always
been
so
difficult
but
in
the
end
so
easily
led
she
had
unlimited
confidence
in
herself
do
be
a
goose
she
exclaimed
at
last
of
course
you
want
your
reward
and
of
course
you
have
it
some
day
you
always
lived
with
your
head
partly
in
the
clouds
and
it
always
been
my
task
to
pull
you
down
to
earth
i
suppose
i
shall
have
to
do
the
same
again
but
i
have
patience
i
feel
suddenly
gay
you
are
so
philip
but
you
look
ten
times
nicer
still
if
you
only
smile
once
or
twice
and
look
as
though
you
were
glad
the
whole
thing
was
a
nightmare
to
him
the
horror
of
it
was
in
his
blood
yet
he
did
his
best
to
obey
plain
speaking
just
then
was
impossible
he
drank
glass
after
glass
of
wine
and
called
for
liqueurs
she
held
his
fingers
for
a
moment
under
the
table
oh
philip
she
whispered
ca
you
forget
that
you
have
ever
been
a
dear
we
are
only
human
and
did
suffer
so
you
know
she
went
on
you
were
made
for
the
things
that
are
coming
to
us
improved
already
ever
so
much
i
like
your
clothes
and
the
way
you
carry
yourself
but
you
look
oh
so
sad
and
so
far
away
all
the
time
when
i
came
to
your
rooms
at
my
first
glimpse
of
you
i
knew
that
you
were
miserable
we
must
alter
all
that
dear
tell
me
how
it
is
that
with
all
your
success
you
have
been
happy
memories
he
answered
harshly
only
a
few
hours
before
you
came
i
was
in
hell
then
you
had
better
make
up
your
mind
she
told
him
firmly
that
you
are
going
to
climb
up
out
of
there
and
when
you
out
you
going
to
stay
out
you
ca
alter
the
past
you
ca
alter
even
the
smallest
detail
of
its
setting
just
as
inevitably
as
our
lives
come
and
go
so
what
has
happened
is
finished
with
unchangeable
it
is
only
a
weak
person
who
would
spoil
the
present
and
the
future
brooding
you
used
not
to
be
weak
philip
i
do
think
that
i
am
really
he
said
i
am
moody
though
and
that
almost
as
bad
the
sight
of
you
brought
it
all
back
and
that
fellow
dane
i
been
frightened
of
him
beatrice
well
you
need
be
any
longer
she
declared
what
you
want
is
some
one
with
you
all
the
time
who
understands
you
some
one
to
drive
back
those
other
thoughts
when
they
come
to
worry
you
it
is
really
a
very
good
thing
for
you
dear
that
i
came
out
to
new
york
dane
is
going
to
be
very
disappointed
when
i
tell
him
that
i
never
saw
you
before
in
my
life
do
you
love
the
music
listen
to
that
waltz
that
was
written
for
happy
people
philip
i
adore
this
place
i
suppose
we
shall
find
others
that
we
like
better
as
time
goes
on
but
i
shall
always
think
of
this
evening
it
is
the
beginning
of
my
task
too
philip
with
you
for
you
what
has
really
happened
dear
i
ca
realise
anything
i
feel
as
though
the
gates
of
some
great
prison
had
been
thrown
and
everything
there
was
to
long
for
in
life
was
just
there
within
reach
waiting
i
am
glad
so
much
gladder
than
i
should
have
imagined
possible
it
wonderful
to
have
you
again
i
did
even
feel
that
i
missed
you
so
much
but
i
know
now
what
it
was
that
made
life
so
appalling
tell
me
am
i
still
nice
to
look
at
of
course
you
are
he
assured
her
ca
you
understand
that
by
the
way
people
notice
you
she
strummed
upon
the
table
with
her
fingers
her
whole
body
seemed
to
be
moving
to
the
music
she
nodded
several
times
i
do
want
them
to
notice
me
philip
she
murmured
i
want
you
to
look
just
for
a
moment
as
though
you
thought
me
the
only
person
in
the
world
as
you
did
once
you
know
he
did
his
best
to
be
responsive
but
he
was
not
wholly
successful
nevertheless
she
was
tolerant
with
his
shortcomings
they
sat
there
until
nearly
three
it
was
she
at
last
who
rose
reluctantly
to
her
feet
i
want
to
go
whilst
the
memory
of
it
all
is
wonderful
she
declared
come
here
a
card
with
my
address
on
drive
me
home
now
please
he
paid
his
bill
and
they
found
a
cab
she
linked
her
arm
through
his
her
head
sank
a
little
upon
his
shoulder
he
made
no
movement
she
waited
for
a
moment
then
she
leaned
back
amongst
the
cushions
philip
she
asked
quietly
has
this
elizabeth
dalstan
been
letting
you
make
love
to
her
please
do
speak
of
miss
dalstan
like
that
he
begged
answer
my
question
she
insisted
miss
dalstan
has
been
very
kind
to
me
he
admitted
slowly
wonderfully
kind
if
you
really
want
to
know
i
do
care
for
her
more
than
you
did
for
me
very
much
more
he
answered
bravely
and
in
a
different
fashion
in
the
darkness
of
the
cab
it
seemed
to
him
that
her
face
had
grown
whiter
her
arm
remained
within
his
but
it
clasped
him
no
longer
her
body
seemed
to
have
become
limp
even
her
voice
firm
though
it
was
seemed
pitched
in
a
different
key
listen
she
said
you
will
have
to
forget
miss
dalstan
i
have
made
up
my
mind
what
i
want
in
life
and
i
am
going
to
have
it
i
shall
draw
my
money
morning
and
afterwards
i
shall
come
straight
to
your
rooms
then
we
will
talk
i
want
more
than
just
that
money
i
am
lonely
and
do
you
know
philip
i
believe
that
i
must
have
cared
for
you
all
the
time
and
you
you
must
have
cared
for
me
a
little
or
you
would
never
have
done
that
for
my
sake
you
must
and
you
shall
care
philip
because
our
time
has
come
and
i
want
you
please
shall
i
have
to
say
it
dear
i
want
you
to
marry
me
he
wrenched
himself
free
from
her
that
is
quite
out
of
the
question
beatrice
he
declared
she
laughed
at
him
mockingly
oh
do
say
that
philip
you
might
tempt
me
to
be
brutal
you
might
tempt
me
to
speak
horribly
plain
words
to
you
speak
them
and
have
done
with
it
he
told
her
roughly
i
might
find
a
few
too
i
am
past
hurting
she
replied
and
i
am
not
in
the
least
afraid
of
anything
you
could
say
you
robbed
me
of
the
man
who
was
bringing
me
to
america
who
would
have
married
me
some
day
i
suppose
well
you
must
pay
do
you
see
and
in
my
way
i
have
told
you
the
way
i
choose
you
want
me
to
marry
you
he
demanded
simply
marry
you
you
do
not
care
whether
i
have
any
love
for
you
or
whether
i
loathe
you
now
you
could
loathe
me
could
you
she
begged
the
thought
of
those
long
days
we
spent
together
in
our
prison
house
would
rise
up
and
forbid
it
kiss
me
i
will
not
her
lips
sought
his
in
vain
he
pushed
her
away
do
you
understand
he
exclaimed
there
is
another
woman
whom
i
have
kissed
whom
i
am
longing
to
kiss
now
but
we
are
old
friends
she
pleaded
and
i
am
lonely
kiss
me
how
you
like
do
be
foolish
he
kissed
her
upon
the
cheek
she
pulled
down
her
veil
the
cab
had
stopped
before
the
door
of
her
hotel
you
are
not
to
worry
any
more
about
ugly
things
philip
she
whispered
holding
his
hand
for
a
moment
as
he
rang
the
bell
for
her
you
are
safe
remember
quite
safe
i
come
to
take
care
of
you
you
need
it
so
badly
good
night
dear
chapter
xv
late
though
it
was
when
philip
reached
his
rooms
he
found
on
his
writing
table
a
message
addressed
to
him
from
the
telephone
call
office
in
the
building
he
tore
it
open
kindly
ring
up
number
avenue
immediately
you
return
whatever
the
time
he
glanced
at
the
clock
hesitated
and
finally
approaching
the
instrument
called
up
elizabeth
number
for
a
few
moments
he
waited
the
silence
in
the
streets
outside
seemed
somehow
to
have
become
communicated
to
the
line
the
space
between
them
emptied
of
all
the
jarring
sounds
of
the
day
it
was
across
a
deep
gulf
of
silence
that
he
heard
at
last
her
voice
yes
is
that
you
philip
i
am
here
he
answered
i
am
sorry
it
is
so
late
have
you
only
just
come
in
this
moment
has
that
girl
kept
you
out
till
now
she
asked
reprovingly
i
could
help
it
he
replied
it
was
her
first
night
over
here
i
took
her
to
churchill
for
supper
is
everything
all
right
with
her
she
does
mean
to
make
trouble
the
unconscious
irony
of
the
question
almost
forced
a
smile
to
his
lips
i
do
think
so
he
answered
she
is
thoroughly
excited
at
the
idea
of
possessing
the
money
i
believe
she
thought
that
douglas
would
have
drawn
it
all
she
is
going
straight
to
the
bank
early
in
the
morning
to
get
hold
of
it
what
about
the
man
dane
he
has
gone
to
chicago
he
wo
be
back
for
several
days
there
was
a
moment
pause
have
you
anything
to
ask
me
she
enquired
nothing
i
have
had
the
most
extraordinary
letter
from
sylvanus
you
and
he
have
met
yes
he
admitted
philip
we
must
make
up
our
minds
you
mean
that
you
must
make
up
your
mind
he
answered
gently
there
was
another
silence
then
she
spoke
a
little
abruptly
i
wonder
whether
you
really
love
me
philip
no
do
please
try
to
answer
such
a
foolish
question
go
to
bed
and
sleep
well
now
you
had
a
trying
day
good
night
dear
he
had
barely
time
to
say
good
night
before
he
heard
the
ring
off
he
set
down
the
receiver
somehow
there
was
a
sensation
of
relief
in
having
been
although
indirectly
in
touch
with
her
the
idea
of
the
letter
from
sylvanus
power
affected
him
only
hazily
the
crowded
events
of
the
day
had
somehow
or
other
dulled
his
power
of
concentrated
thought
he
felt
a
curious
sense
of
passivity
he
undressed
without
conscious
effort
closed
his
eyes
and
slept
until
he
was
awakened
by
the
movements
of
the
valet
about
the
room
philip
was
still
seated
over
his
breakfast
reading
the
paper
and
finishing
his
coffee
when
the
door
was
thrown
suddenly
open
and
beatrice
entered
tumultuously
she
laughed
at
his
air
of
blank
surprise
you
booby
she
exclaimed
i
could
help
coming
in
to
wish
you
good
morning
i
have
just
discovered
that
my
hotel
is
quite
close
by
here
lucky
is
it
except
that
i
am
going
to
move
good
morning
serious
face
she
went
on
leaning
towards
him
her
hands
behind
her
her
lips
held
out
invitingly
he
set
down
his
paper
kissed
her
on
the
cheek
and
looked
inside
the
coffeepot
have
you
had
your
breakfast
hours
ago
i
was
too
excited
to
sleep
when
i
got
to
bed
and
yet
i
feel
so
well
philip
where
wall
street
wo
you
take
me
there
he
shook
his
head
i
am
expecting
a
visitor
and
i
have
piles
of
work
to
do
she
made
a
grimace
i
know
i
shall
be
terrified
when
i
march
up
to
the
counter
of
the
bank
and
say
i
come
for
twenty
thousand
pounds
you
must
transfer
it
to
a
current
account
he
explained
in
your
own
name
have
you
any
papers
with
you
for
identification
i
mean
she
nodded
i
thought
of
all
that
i
a
photograph
and
a
passport
and
some
letters
it
is
that
i
really
afraid
but
i
hate
being
alone
and
you
look
so
nice
philip
dear
i
always
loved
you
in
blue
serge
and
i
adore
your
eyeglass
you
really
have
been
clever
in
the
small
things
you
have
done
to
change
your
appearance
perhaps
you
are
right
not
to
come
though
she
went
on
looking
in
the
mirror
these
clothes
are
the
best
i
could
get
at
a
minute
notice
dane
was
really
quite
nice
but
he
had
the
least
idea
how
long
it
takes
a
woman
to
prepare
for
a
journey
never
mind
you
wait
until
i
get
back
here
this
afternoon
i
am
going
round
to
all
the
shops
and
i
am
going
to
bring
the
clothes
i
buy
away
with
me
then
i
am
going
to
lock
myself
in
my
room
and
change
everything
i
am
going
to
have
some
of
those
funny
little
patent
shoes
and
silk
stockings
and
oh
well
all
sorts
of
things
you
would
understand
about
and
do
try
and
cheer
up
before
i
get
back
please
philip
twelve
months
ago
you
would
have
thought
all
this
paradise
oh
i
ca
stop
a
moment
longer
she
wound
up
throwing
away
the
cigarette
she
had
taken
from
the
box
and
lit
i
off
now
and
philip
do
you
dare
to
go
out
of
these
rooms
until
i
come
back
she
turned
towards
the
door
she
was
there
in
fact
when
they
were
both
aware
of
a
ring
at
the
bell
she
stopped
short
and
looked
around
enquiringly
who
that
she
whispered
philip
glanced
at
the
clock
it
was
too
early
for
elizabeth
no
idea
he
answered
come
in
the
door
opened
and
closed
philip
sat
as
though
turned
to
stone
beatrice
remained
in
the
middle
of
the
room
her
fingers
clasping
the
back
of
a
chair
dane
hat
in
hand
had
entered
good
morning
miss
wenderley
he
said
good
morning
mr
ware
philip
said
nothing
he
had
a
horrible
feeling
that
this
was
some
trap
beatrice
at
first
could
only
stare
at
the
unexpected
visitor
his
sudden
appearance
had
disconcerted
her
i
thought
you
were
in
chicago
mr
dane
she
exclaimed
at
last
my
plans
were
altered
at
the
last
moment
he
told
her
no
i
wo
sit
down
thanks
he
added
waving
away
the
chair
towards
which
philip
had
pointed
as
a
matter
of
fact
i
have
been
out
of
new
york
i
decided
to
wait
and
hear
your
news
miss
wenderley
well
you
going
to
be
disappointed
then
she
said
bluntly
i
have
any
dane
was
politely
incredulous
he
was
also
a
little
stern
you
mean
he
protested
that
you
can
not
identify
this
gentleman
that
you
do
recognise
him
as
douglas
romilly
i
can
not
identify
him
she
repeated
he
is
not
douglas
romilly
i
have
brought
you
all
this
way
then
to
confront
you
with
a
stranger
absolutely
she
insisted
it
was
my
fault
i
did
want
to
come
dane
expression
suddenly
changed
his
hard
knuckles
were
pressed
upon
the
table
he
leaned
forward
towards
her
even
his
tone
was
altered
his
blandness
had
all
vanished
his
grey
eyes
were
as
hard
as
steel
a
stranger
he
exclaimed
derisively
yet
you
come
here
to
his
rooms
early
in
the
evening
you
stay
here
you
go
to
the
theatre
with
him
the
same
night
you
go
on
to
supper
at
churchill
and
stay
there
till
three
in
the
morning
you
are
here
with
him
again
at
nine
at
breakfast
time
a
stranger
miss
wenderley
think
again
a
story
like
this
might
do
for
scotland
yard
it
wo
do
for
us
out
here
she
knew
at
once
that
she
had
fallen
into
a
trap
but
she
was
not
wholly
dismayed
the
position
was
one
which
they
had
half
anticipated
she
told
herself
that
he
was
bluffing
that
it
was
simply
the
outburst
of
a
disappointed
man
on
the
whole
she
behaved
extraordinarily
well
you
brought
me
out
here
she
said
to
confront
me
with
this
man
to
identify
him
if
i
could
as
douglas
romilly
well
he
is
douglas
romilly
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
as
to
my
going
out
with
him
last
evening
i
ca
see
that
that
any
concern
of
any
one
he
was
kind
to
me
cheered
me
up
when
he
saw
that
i
was
disappointed
i
told
him
my
whole
story
and
that
i
did
know
a
soul
in
new
york
and
we
became
friends
that
all
there
is
about
it
that
so
the
detective
observed
with
quiet
sarcasm
you
seem
to
have
a
knack
of
making
friends
pretty
easily
miss
wenderley
it
is
not
your
business
if
i
have
she
snapped
well
we
pass
that
then
he
conceded
i
have
quite
finished
with
you
yet
though
there
are
just
one
or
two
more
points
i
am
going
to
put
before
you
and
this
gentleman
who
is
not
douglas
romilly
he
added
with
a
little
bow
to
philip
the
first
is
this
there
is
one
fact
which
we
can
all
three
take
for
granted
because
i
know
it
i
can
prove
it
a
hundred
times
over
and
you
both
know
it
and
that
is
that
the
merton
ware
of
travelled
from
liverpool
on
the
as
douglas
romilly
occupied
a
room
at
the
waldorf
astoria
hotel
as
douglas
romilly
and
absconded
from
there
leaving
his
luggage
and
his
identity
behind
him
to
blossom
out
in
an
attic
of
the
monmouth
tenement
house
as
merton
ware
a
young
writer
of
plays
now
i
do
think
dane
went
on
leaning
a
little
further
over
the
table
that
the
douglas
romilly
who
has
disappeared
was
ever
capable
of
writing
a
play
i
do
think
he
was
a
man
of
talent
at
all
i
do
think
he
could
have
written
for
instance
house
of
shams
let
us
however
leave
the
subject
of
douglas
romilly
for
a
moment
let
us
go
a
little
further
back
to
detton
magna
let
us
say
curiously
enough
there
was
another
young
man
who
disappeared
from
that
little
derbyshire
village
about
the
same
time
who
has
never
been
heard
of
since
his
name
too
was
romilly
i
gathered
during
the
course
of
my
recent
enquiries
that
he
was
a
poor
relation
a
cousin
of
douglas
romilly
he
was
drowned
in
the
canal
beatrice
faltered
his
body
has
been
found
a
body
has
been
found
dane
corrected
but
it
was
in
an
unrecognisable
state
it
has
been
presumed
to
be
the
body
of
philip
romilly
the
poor
relation
a
starving
young
art
teacher
in
london
with
literary
aspirations
but
i
hold
that
that
presumption
is
a
mistake
i
believe
the
detective
went
on
his
eyes
fastened
upon
philip
his
voice
a
little
raised
that
it
was
the
body
of
douglas
romilly
the
shoe
manufacturer
which
was
fished
out
from
the
canal
and
that
you
sir
are
philip
romilly
late
teacher
of
kensington
who
murdered
douglas
romilly
on
the
banks
of
the
canal
stole
his
money
and
pocketbook
assumed
his
identity
in
liverpool
and
on
the
and
became
what
you
are
now
merton
ware
philip
threw
away
the
cigarette
which
he
had
been
smoking
and
leaning
over
the
box
carefully
selected
another
he
tapped
it
against
the
table
and
lit
it
dane
he
said
coolly
i
shall
always
be
grateful
to
you
for
your
visit
this
morning
for
you
have
given
me
what
is
the
most
difficult
thing
in
the
whole
world
to
stumble
up
against
an
excellent
idea
for
a
new
play
apart
from
that
you
seem
for
so
intelligent
a
man
to
have
wasted
a
good
deal
of
your
time
and
to
have
come
what
we
should
call
in
english
a
cropper
i
will
take
you
into
my
confidence
so
far
as
to
admit
that
i
am
not
particularly
anxious
to
disclose
my
private
history
but
if
ever
the
necessity
should
arise
i
shall
do
so
without
hesitation
until
that
time
comes
you
must
forgive
me
if
i
choose
to
preserve
a
certain
reticence
as
to
my
antecedents
dane
in
the
moment
breathless
silence
which
followed
acknowledged
to
himself
the
perpetration
of
a
rare
mistake
he
had
selected
philip
to
bear
the
brunt
of
his
attack
believing
him
to
be
possessed
of
the
weaker
nerve
beatrice
who
at
the
end
of
his
last
speech
had
sunk
into
a
chair
white
and
terrified
an
easy
victim
had
rallied
now
inspired
by
philip
composure
you
deny
then
that
you
are
philip
romilly
the
detective
asked
i
never
heard
of
the
fellow
in
my
life
philip
replied
pleasantly
but
do
go
dane
you
ca
imagine
how
interesting
this
is
to
me
you
have
sent
me
a
most
charming
acquaintance
he
added
bowing
to
beatrice
and
you
have
provided
me
with
what
i
can
assure
you
is
almost
pathetically
scarce
in
these
days
a
new
and
very
dramatic
idea
take
a
seat
wo
you
and
chat
with
us
a
little
longer
tell
us
how
you
came
to
think
of
all
this
i
have
always
held
that
the
workings
of
a
criminologist
brain
must
be
one
of
the
most
interesting
studies
in
life
dane
smiled
enigmatically
ah
he
protested
you
must
ask
me
to
disclose
all
my
secrets
you
would
care
to
tell
us
a
little
about
your
future
intentions
philip
enquired
dane
shook
his
head
it
is
very
kind
of
you
merton
ware
he
confessed
to
let
me
down
so
gently
we
all
make
mistakes
of
course
as
to
my
future
intentions
well
i
am
not
quite
sure
about
them
you
see
this
is
really
my
job
at
all
it
is
up
to
me
to
hunt
out
english
criminals
so
long
as
they
behave
themselves
in
this
city
if
an
extradition
order
or
anything
of
that
sort
came
my
way
it
would
of
course
be
different
why
not
lay
this
interesting
theory
of
yours
before
the
authorities
at
scotland
yard
philip
suggested
i
am
sure
they
would
listen
with
immense
interest
to
any
report
from
you
that
some
idea
certainly
the
detective
admitted
taking
up
his
hat
from
the
table
for
the
present
i
wish
you
both
good
morning
or
shall
i
say
an
revoir
we
may
look
for
the
pleasure
of
another
visit
from
you
then
philip
enquired
politely
the
detective
faced
them
from
the
doorway
sir
he
said
to
philip
i
admire
your
nerve
and
i
admire
the
nerve
of
your
old
sweetheart
miss
wenderley
i
am
afraid
i
can
not
promise
you
however
that
this
will
be
my
last
visit
the
door
closed
behind
him
they
heard
the
shrill
summons
of
the
bell
the
arrival
of
the
lift
the
clanging
of
the
iron
gate
and
its
subsequent
descent
then
beatrice
turned
her
head
philip
was
still
smoking
serenely
standing
with
his
back
to
the
mantelpiece
his
hands
in
his
pockets
she
rose
and
threw
her
arms
around
him
philip
she
cried
why
you
are
wonderful
you
are
marvellous
you
make
me
ashamed
it
was
only
for
a
moment
that
i
lost
my
nerve
and
you
saved
us
oh
what
idiots
we
were
of
course
he
meant
to
watch
why
he
told
me
he
was
going
to
chicago
the
beast
he
seems
to
have
got
hold
of
the
idea
all
right
does
he
philip
muttered
pooh
she
exclaimed
encouragingly
i
know
a
little
about
the
law
so
do
you
he
has
any
proof
he
never
can
have
any
proof
no
one
will
ever
be
able
to
swear
that
the
body
which
they
picked
out
of
the
canal
was
the
body
of
douglas
romilly
there
was
a
soul
who
saw
you
do
it
i
am
the
only
person
in
the
world
who
could
supply
the
motive
and
i
i
shall
never
be
any
use
to
them
do
you
see
philip
i
shall
be
your
wife
a
wife
ca
give
evidence
against
her
husband
you
be
safe
dear
quite
safe
he
withdrew
a
little
from
her
embrace
beatrice
he
reminded
her
there
is
another
tragedy
beyond
the
one
with
which
dane
threatens
us
i
do
not
wish
to
marry
you
she
suddenly
blazed
up
because
not
because
of
any
reason
in
the
world
he
interrupted
except
that
i
love
elizabeth
dalstan
does
she
want
to
marry
you
he
was
suddenly
an
altered
person
some
of
his
confidence
seemed
to
desert
him
he
shook
his
head
doubtfully
i
am
not
sure
sometimes
i
think
that
she
would
sometimes
i
fancy
that
it
is
only
a
great
kindness
of
heart
an
immense
sympathy
a
kind
of
protective
sympathy
which
has
made
her
so
good
to
me
she
looked
at
herself
steadily
for
a
moment
in
the
mirror
then
she
pulled
down
her
veil
philip
she
said
we
find
out
the
truth
when
we
are
up
against
things
like
this
i
used
to
think
i
could
live
alone
i
ca
whatever
you
may
think
of
me
i
was
fond
of
douglas
it
was
only
for
the
sake
of
the
money
and
the
comfort
he
was
kind
and
in
his
way
he
understood
and
then
you
know
misery
did
agree
with
you
you
were
often
even
in
those
few
hours
we
spent
together
very
hard
and
cold
anyway
she
added
with
a
little
tightening
of
the
lips
i
am
going
to
get
my
money
now
no
one
can
stop
that
you
stay
here
and
think
it
over
it
would
be
better
to
marry
me
philip
and
be
safe
than
to
have
the
fear
of
that
man
dane
always
before
you
and
wait
wait
till
you
see
me
when
i
come
back
she
went
on
her
spirits
rapidly
rising
as
she
moved
towards
the
door
you
change
your
mind
then
philip
you
were
always
so
impressionable
were
you
a
little
touch
of
colour
the
perfume
of
flowers
a
single
soft
word
spoken
at
the
right
moment
anything
that
took
your
fancy
made
such
a
difference
well
just
wait
till
i
come
back
she
closed
the
door
philip
heard
her
descend
in
the
lift
he
moved
to
the
window
and
watched
for
her
on
the
pavement
she
appeared
there
in
a
moment
or
two
and
waited
whilst
the
boy
whistled
for
a
taxicab
her
face
expectantly
upraised
one
hand
resting
lightly
on
her
bosom
just
over
the
spot
where
her
pocketbook
lay
chapter
xvi
philip
was
still
gazing
into
vacancy
and
smoking
cigarettes
when
elizabeth
arrived
she
seemed
conscious
at
once
of
the
disturbed
atmosphere
his
hands
which
she
held
firmly
in
hers
were
as
cold
as
ice
is
that
girl
going
to
be
troublesome
she
demanded
anxiously
not
in
the
way
we
feared
he
replied
all
the
same
the
plot
has
thickened
so
far
as
i
am
concerned
that
fellow
dane
has
been
here
go
on
she
begged
he
laid
a
trap
for
us
and
we
fell
into
it
like
the
veriest
simpletons
he
let
beatrice
think
that
he
had
gone
to
chicago
of
course
he
did
nothing
of
the
sort
he
turned
her
loose
to
come
to
me
and
he
had
us
watched
he
knew
that
we
spent
last
evening
together
as
old
friends
she
was
here
in
my
rooms
this
morning
when
he
arrived
oh
philip
philip
she
murmured
well
what
does
he
suspect
the
truth
he
accused
me
to
my
face
of
being
philip
romilly
beatrice
did
her
best
but
you
see
the
position
was
a
little
absurd
she
denied
strenuously
that
she
had
ever
seen
me
before
that
i
was
anything
but
a
stranger
to
her
in
the
face
of
last
evening
and
his
finding
her
here
this
morning
it
did
sound
convincing
what
is
dane
going
to
do
heaven
knows
it
is
his
affair
really
if
there
were
any
charge
against
me
well
you
see
there
have
to
be
an
extradition
order
i
should
think
he
will
probably
lay
the
facts
before
scotland
yard
and
let
them
do
what
they
choose
she
made
him
sit
down
and
drew
a
low
chair
herself
to
his
side
she
held
his
hand
in
hers
philip
she
said
soothingly
they
ca
possibly
prove
anything
they
can
prove
he
pointed
out
that
i
was
in
detton
magna
that
afternoon
i
do
think
any
one
except
beatrice
saw
me
start
along
the
canal
path
but
they
can
prove
that
i
knew
all
about
douglas
disappearance
because
i
travelled
to
america
under
his
name
and
with
his
ticket
and
deliberately
personated
him
they
can
prove
all
that
she
agreed
but
they
ca
prove
the
crime
itself
beatrice
is
the
only
person
who
could
do
that
she
proposes
to
marry
me
he
announced
grimly
that
would
prevent
her
giving
evidence
at
all
elizabeth
suddenly
threw
her
arms
around
his
neck
and
held
her
cheek
to
his
she
sha
marry
you
she
declared
i
want
you
myself
elizabeth
yes
i
have
made
up
my
mind
philip
it
is
no
use
the
other
things
are
fascinating
and
splendid
in
their
way
but
they
do
count
they
last
they
tinsel
dear
and
i
do
want
tinsel
i
want
the
gold
we
face
this
bravely
wherever
it
leads
however
far
however
deep
down
and
then
we
start
again
you
know
what
this
means
elizabeth
he
faltered
that
man
power
she
brushed
the
thought
away
i
know
he
close
the
theatre
he
do
all
he
can
to
harm
us
that
does
matter
the
play
is
ours
that
worth
a
fortune
and
the
new
one
coming
why
it
wonderful
philip
we
do
want
wealth
your
brain
and
my
art
can
win
us
all
that
we
desire
in
life
we
shall
have
something
sweeter
than
anything
which
sylvanus
power
millions
could
buy
we
shall
have
our
love
your
love
for
me
dear
and
mine
for
you
he
felt
her
tears
upon
his
cheek
her
lips
pressed
to
his
he
held
her
there
but
although
his
heart
was
beating
with
renewed
hope
he
said
nothing
for
a
time
when
she
stepped
back
to
look
at
his
face
however
the
change
was
already
there
you
are
glad
philip
she
cried
you
are
happy
i
can
see
it
you
did
ever
care
really
for
that
girl
did
you
he
almost
laughed
not
like
this
he
answered
confidently
i
never
even
for
a
single
moment
pretended
to
care
in
a
great
way
we
were
just
companions
in
misfortune
the
madness
that
came
over
me
that
day
had
been
growing
in
my
brain
for
years
i
hated
douglas
romilly
i
had
every
reason
to
hate
him
and
then
after
all
he
had
robbed
me
of
my
one
companion
she
stopped
him
i
know
i
know
she
murmured
you
need
never
try
to
explain
anything
to
me
i
know
everything
i
understand
i
sympathise
a
revulsion
of
feeling
had
suddenly
chilled
him
he
held
her
to
him
none
the
less
tightly
but
there
was
a
ring
of
despair
in
his
tone
elizabeth
think
what
it
may
mean
he
muttered
how
can
i
drag
you
through
it
all
a
trial
perhaps
the
suspense
and
all
the
time
that
guilty
knowledge
behind
yours
and
mine
pooh
she
exclaimed
lightly
i
am
not
a
sentimentalist
i
am
a
woman
in
love
but
elizabeth
i
am
guilty
he
groaned
that
the
horror
of
it
take
the
risk
if
i
were
an
innocent
man
i
risk
everything
but
i
am
afraid
to
stand
there
and
know
that
every
word
they
say
against
me
will
be
true
and
every
word
of
the
men
who
speak
in
my
defence
will
be
false
ca
you
realise
the
black
abominable
horror
of
it
i
could
drag
you
into
such
a
plight
elizabeth
i
was
weak
to
think
of
it
i
could
you
drag
me
nowhere
she
answered
holding
him
tightly
where
i
go
my
feet
will
lead
me
and
my
love
for
you
you
ca
help
that
play
the
game
play
it
magnificently
philip
my
faith
in
you
will
count
for
something
but
dear
he
protested
do
you
see
if
the
case
ever
comes
into
court
even
if
i
get
off
every
one
will
know
that
it
is
through
a
technicality
the
evidence
is
too
strong
half
the
world
at
least
will
believe
me
guilty
it
sha
come
into
court
she
proclaimed
confidently
i
shall
talk
to
dane
i
have
some
influence
with
the
police
authorities
here
i
shall
point
out
how
ridiculous
it
all
is
what
the
use
of
formulating
a
charge
that
they
can
never
never
prove
unless
he
reminded
her
hesitatingly
beatrice
beatrice
you
not
afraid
of
her
i
am
afraid
of
no
one
or
anything
he
declared
when
you
are
here
but
beatrice
has
been
behaving
strangely
ever
since
she
arrived
she
has
a
sudden
fancy
for
remembering
that
in
a
sense
we
were
once
engaged
beatrice
elizabeth
announced
must
be
satisfied
with
her
twenty
thousand
pounds
i
know
what
you
are
trying
to
say
she
wants
you
she
sha
have
you
philip
we
find
her
some
one
else
we
be
kind
to
her
i
do
mind
that
very
soon
we
find
her
plenty
of
friends
but
as
for
you
philip
well
she
just
sha
have
you
and
that
all
there
is
about
it
he
took
her
suddenly
into
his
arms
in
that
moment
he
was
the
lover
she
had
craved
for
strong
passionate
and
reckless
all
the
love
that
my
heart
has
ever
known
he
cried
is
yours
elizabeth
every
thought
and
every
hope
is
yours
you
are
my
life
you
saved
me
you
made
me
what
i
am
the
play
is
yours
my
brain
is
yours
there
is
a
thought
or
a
dream
or
a
wish
that
is
for
you
of
you
yours
he
kissed
her
as
he
had
never
dreamed
of
kissing
any
woman
it
was
the
one
supreme
moment
of
their
life
and
their
love
time
passed
uncounted
then
interruption
came
suddenly
and
tragically
without
knock
or
ring
the
door
was
flung
open
and
slammed
again
beatrice
stood
there
still
in
her
shabby
clothes
her
veil
pushed
back
gloveless
and
breathless
her
clenched
hand
flew
out
towards
philip
as
though
she
would
have
struck
him
you
liar
she
shrieked
you
had
my
money
you
spent
it
stolen
it
thief
murderer
she
paused
struggling
for
breath
tore
her
hat
from
her
head
and
threw
it
on
the
table
her
face
was
like
the
face
of
a
virago
her
eyes
blazed
her
cheeks
were
as
pale
as
death
save
for
one
hectic
spot
of
colour
you
are
talking
nonsense
beatrice
he
expostulated
do
lie
to
me
she
shouted
you
can
lie
in
the
dock
when
you
stand
there
and
tell
them
you
never
murdered
douglas
romilly
that
makes
you
cringe
does
it
i
do
want
to
make
a
scene
but
the
woman
you
in
love
with
had
better
hear
what
i
have
to
say
are
you
going
to
give
me
back
my
money
philip
as
i
stand
here
he
declared
solemnly
i
have
not
touched
that
money
or
been
near
the
bank
where
it
was
deposited
i
swear
it
every
penny
i
have
spent
since
i
moved
into
this
apartment
i
have
spent
from
my
earnings
my
own
royalties
come
to
over
a
hundred
pounds
a
week
more
than
sufficient
to
keep
me
in
luxury
i
never
meant
to
touch
that
money
i
have
not
touched
it
his
words
carried
conviction
with
them
she
stood
there
for
several
seconds
absolutely
rigid
her
eyes
growing
larger
and
rounder
her
lips
a
little
parted
bewilderment
was
now
struggling
with
her
passion
who
in
god
name
then
she
asked
hoarsely
could
have
known
about
the
money
and
forged
his
signature
i
tell
you
that
i
seen
it
with
my
own
eyes
a
few
minutes
ago
in
the
bank
they
showed
me
into
a
little
cupboard
a
place
without
any
roof
and
laid
it
there
before
me
on
the
desk
his
cheque
and
signature
for
the
whole
amount
philip
looked
at
her
earnestly
oppressed
by
a
sense
of
coming
trouble
beatrice
he
said
i
would
deceive
you
i
should
be
a
fool
to
try
should
i
i
can
only
repeat
what
i
have
said
i
have
never
been
near
the
bank
i
have
never
touched
that
money
she
shivered
a
little
where
she
stood
it
was
obvious
that
she
was
convinced
but
her
sense
of
personal
injustice
remained
unabated
then
there
is
some
one
else
she
declared
who
knows
everything
some
one
else
my
man
she
added
leaning
across
the
table
and
shaking
her
head
with
a
sudden
fierceness
who
can
step
into
the
witness
box
and
tell
the
truth
about
you
you
must
find
out
who
it
is
you
must
find
out
who
has
stolen
that
money
and
get
it
back
i
tell
you
i
wo
have
everything
snatched
away
from
me
like
this
she
cried
her
voice
breaking
hysterically
i
wo
be
robbed
of
life
and
happiness
and
everything
that
counts
i
want
my
money
are
you
going
to
get
it
back
for
me
beatrice
do
be
absurd
he
protested
you
know
very
well
that
i
ca
do
that
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
go
about
making
enquiries
i
shall
be
watched
from
now
day
and
night
if
nothing
worse
happens
a
single
step
on
my
part
in
that
direction
would
mean
disaster
then
take
me
straight
to
the
town
hall
or
the
registry
office
or
wherever
you
go
here
and
marry
me
she
demanded
a
hundred
pounds
a
week
royalty
eh
well
that
good
enough
i
marry
you
philip
do
you
hear
at
once
that
save
your
skin
if
it
wo
get
me
back
my
twenty
thousand
pounds
you
need
flatter
yourself
overmuch
either
i
rather
have
had
douglas
he
more
of
a
man
than
you
after
all
you
are
too
you
think
about
yourself
too
much
you
too
intellectual
too
i
do
want
those
things
i
want
to
live
any
way
you
got
to
marry
me
now
give
me
some
money
do
you
hear
he
took
out
his
pocketbook
and
threw
it
towards
her
she
smoothed
out
the
wad
of
notes
which
it
contained
and
counted
them
with
glistening
eyes
well
there
enough
here
for
a
start
she
decided
slipping
them
into
her
bosom
no
one
shall
rob
me
of
these
before
i
get
to
the
shops
better
come
with
me
philip
i
not
going
to
leave
you
alone
with
her
elizabeth
would
have
intervened
but
philip
laid
his
hand
upon
her
arm
beatrice
he
said
sternly
you
are
a
little
beside
yourself
listen
i
do
understand
what
has
happened
i
must
think
about
it
apparently
that
twenty
thousand
pounds
has
gone
but
so
far
as
regards
money
i
recognise
your
claim
you
shall
have
half
my
earnings
i
write
more
i
make
it
up
somehow
but
for
the
rest
this
morning
has
cleared
away
many
misunderstandings
let
this
be
the
last
word
miss
dalstan
has
promised
to
be
my
wife
she
is
the
only
woman
i
could
ever
love
then
you
have
to
marry
me
without
loving
me
beatrice
declared
thickly
i
wo
be
left
alone
in
this
beastly
city
i
want
some
one
to
take
care
of
me
i
am
getting
frightened
it
uncanny
horrible
i
oh
i
am
so
miserable
so
miserable
she
sank
into
a
chair
and
fell
forward
across
the
table
sobbing
hysterically
i
hate
every
one
she
moaned
philip
why
ca
you
be
kind
to
me
why
does
some
one
care
chapter
xvii
and
after
all
nothing
happened
dane
barely
veiled
threats
seemed
to
vanish
like
the
man
himself
into
thin
air
beatrice
after
the
breakdown
of
her
one
passionate
outburst
had
become
wonderfully
meek
and
tractable
sylvanus
power
who
had
received
from
elizabeth
the
message
for
which
he
had
waited
showed
no
sign
either
of
disappointment
or
anger
after
the
storm
which
had
seemed
to
be
breaking
in
upon
him
from
every
quarter
the
days
which
followed
possessed
for
philip
almost
the
calm
of
an
indian
summer
he
had
found
something
in
life
at
last
stronger
than
his
turbulent
fears
his
whole
nature
was
engrossed
by
one
great
atmosphere
of
deep
and
wonderful
affection
he
spent
a
part
of
every
day
with
elizabeth
and
the
remainder
of
his
time
was
completely
engrossed
by
the
work
over
which
she
too
the
presiding
genius
pored
eagerly
together
they
humoured
many
of
beatrice
whims
treating
her
very
much
as
an
unexpected
protegée
a
position
with
which
she
seemed
entirely
content
she
made
friends
with
the
utmost
facility
she
wore
new
clothes
with
frank
and
obvious
joy
she
preened
herself
before
the
of
life
developed
a
capacity
for
living
and
enjoying
herself
which
under
the
circumstances
was
nothing
less
than
remarkable
and
then
came
the
climax
of
philip
happiness
his
earnest
protests
had
long
since
been
overruled
and
certainly
no
one
could
have
accused
him
of
posing
for
a
single
moment
as
the
reluctant
bridegroom
the
happiness
which
shone
from
their
two
faces
seemed
to
brighten
the
strangely
unecclesiastical
looking
apartment
in
which
a
cheerful
and
exceedingly
pleasant
looking
american
divine
completed
the
formalities
of
their
marriage
it
was
a
queer
little
company
who
hurried
back
to
elizabeth
room
for
tea
elizabeth
and
philip
themselves
and
martha
grimes
and
beatrice
sharing
the
attentions
of
noel
bridges
for
an
event
of
such
stupendous
importance
it
was
amazing
how
perfectly
the
two
persons
chiefly
concerned
were
there
was
only
one
moment
just
before
they
started
for
the
theatre
when
elizabeth
betrayed
the
slightest
signs
of
uneasiness
i
sent
a
telegram
philip
she
said
to
sylvanus
power
i
thought
i
had
better
this
is
his
answer
philip
read
the
few
typewritten
words
on
the
little
slip
of
paper
you
will
hear
from
me
within
hours
philip
frowned
a
little
as
he
handed
it
back
it
was
dated
from
washington
i
think
elizabeth
faltered
he
might
have
sent
his
good
wishes
at
any
rate
philip
laughed
confidently
we
have
nothing
to
fear
he
declared
confidently
from
sylvanus
power
nor
from
any
one
else
in
the
world
elizabeth
murmured
fervently
then
followed
the
wonderful
evening
philip
found
beatrice
alone
in
the
stage
box
when
he
returned
from
taking
elizabeth
to
her
where
martha
he
asked
faithless
beatrice
replied
she
is
in
the
stalls
down
there
with
a
young
man
from
the
box
office
she
said
you
understand
a
serious
affair
philip
ventured
beatrice
nodded
they
are
engaged
i
had
tea
with
them
yesterday
we
shall
have
to
do
something
for
you
beatrice
soon
he
remarked
cheerfully
a
very
rare
gravity
settled
for
a
moment
upon
her
face
i
wonder
philip
she
said
simply
i
thought
a
little
time
ago
it
would
be
easy
enough
to
care
for
the
right
sort
of
person
perhaps
i
am
not
really
quite
so
rotten
as
i
thought
i
was
here
comes
elizabeth
let
watch
her
they
both
leaned
a
little
forward
in
the
box
philip
in
a
state
of
beatific
wonder
which
turned
soon
to
amazement
when
at
first
appearance
the
house
suddenly
rose
and
a
torrent
of
applause
broke
out
from
the
floor
to
the
ceiling
elizabeth
for
a
moment
seemed
dumbfounded
the
fact
that
the
news
of
what
had
happened
that
afternoon
could
so
soon
have
become
public
property
had
not
occurred
to
either
her
or
philip
then
a
sudden
smile
of
comprehension
broke
across
her
face
with
understanding
however
came
a
momentary
embarrassment
she
looked
a
little
pathetically
at
the
great
audience
then
laughed
and
glanced
at
philip
seated
now
well
back
in
the
box
many
of
them
followed
her
gaze
and
the
applause
broke
out
again
then
there
was
silence
she
paused
before
she
spoke
the
first
words
of
her
part
thank
you
so
much
she
said
quietly
it
was
a
queer
little
episode
beatrice
gripped
philip
hand
as
she
drew
her
chair
back
to
his
there
were
tears
in
her
eyes
how
they
love
her
these
people
and
fancy
their
knowing
about
it
philip
already
you
ought
to
have
shown
yourself
as
the
happy
bridegroom
they
were
all
looking
up
here
i
wonder
why
men
are
so
shy
i
glad
i
have
my
new
frock
on
fancy
being
married
only
a
few
hours
ago
tell
me
how
you
are
feeling
ca
you
philip
you
sit
there
looking
like
a
sphinx
you
are
happy
are
you
happier
i
think
than
any
man
has
a
right
to
be
he
answered
his
eyes
watching
elizabeth
every
movement
as
the
play
proceeded
his
silence
only
deepened
he
went
behind
at
the
end
of
each
act
and
spent
a
few
stolen
moments
with
elizabeth
life
was
a
marvellous
thing
indeed
every
pulse
and
nerve
in
his
body
was
tingling
with
happiness
and
yet
as
he
lingered
for
a
moment
in
the
vestibule
of
the
theatre
before
going
back
to
his
box
at
the
commencement
of
the
last
act
he
felt
once
more
that
terrible
wave
of
depression
the
ghostly
uprising
of
his
old
terrors
even
in
this
supreme
moment
he
looked
down
from
the
panorama
of
flaring
into
the
faces
of
the
along
the
crowded
pavement
he
had
a
sudden
fancy
that
dane
was
there
watching
his
heart
beat
fiercely
as
he
stood
almost
transfixed
scanning
eagerly
every
strange
face
then
the
bell
rang
behind
him
he
set
his
teeth
and
turned
away
in
less
than
half
an
hour
the
play
would
be
over
they
would
be
on
their
way
home
he
found
the
box
door
open
and
the
box
itself
to
his
surprise
empty
there
was
no
sign
anywhere
of
beatrice
he
waited
for
a
little
time
then
he
rang
the
bell
for
the
attendant
but
could
hear
no
news
of
her
his
uneasiness
increased
as
the
curtain
at
last
fell
and
she
had
not
returned
he
hurried
round
to
the
back
but
elizabeth
when
he
told
her
only
smiled
why
there
nothing
to
worry
about
dear
she
said
beatrice
can
take
care
of
herself
perhaps
she
thought
it
more
tactful
to
hurry
on
home
tonight
she
is
really
just
as
as
she
can
be
you
know
philip
underneath
all
that
passionate
desire
for
just
a
small
share
of
the
good
things
of
life
she
has
wasted
so
much
of
herself
in
longings
poor
child
i
sometimes
wonder
that
she
is
as
as
she
seems
to
be
now
i
am
ready
they
passed
down
the
corridor
amidst
a
little
chorus
of
good
nights
and
stepped
into
the
automobile
which
was
waiting
as
it
glided
off
she
suddenly
came
closer
to
him
philip
she
whispered
it
true
is
it
put
your
arms
around
me
you
are
driving
me
home
say
it
true
elizabeth
sat
up
presently
a
little
dazed
her
fingers
were
still
gripping
philip
almost
fiercely
the
automobile
had
stopped
i
have
the
least
idea
where
we
are
she
murmured
and
i
forgot
to
tell
you
he
laughed
as
he
helped
her
out
i
took
the
suite
below
mine
by
the
week
there
are
two
or
three
rooms
and
an
extra
one
for
beatrice
of
course
it
small
but
then
with
this
london
idea
before
us
such
extravagance
she
interrupted
your
own
rooms
would
have
done
quite
nicely
only
it
is
a
luxury
to
have
a
place
for
phoebe
i
hope
beatrice
wo
have
gone
to
bed
i
am
sure
she
wo
he
replied
she
has
done
all
the
arranging
for
me
she
and
phoebe
together
they
crossed
the
pavement
and
entered
the
lift
the
attendant
grinned
broadly
as
he
stopped
at
the
eighth
floor
and
held
out
his
hand
for
the
tip
for
which
philip
had
been
fumbling
the
door
of
the
suite
was
opened
before
they
could
reach
the
bell
elizabeth
maid
phoebe
came
forward
to
take
her
mistress
cloak
and
the
floor
valet
was
there
to
relieve
philip
of
his
overcoat
a
waiter
was
hovering
in
the
background
supper
is
served
in
the
dining
room
sir
he
announced
shall
i
open
the
wine
philip
nodded
and
showed
elizabeth
over
the
little
flat
finally
ushering
her
into
the
small
round
dining
room
it
perfectly
delightful
she
declared
but
we
do
need
nearly
so
much
room
philip
what
a
dear
little
dining
table
and
what
a
delicious
supper
everything
i
like
best
in
the
world
from
pâté
de
foie
gras
to
cold
asparagus
you
are
a
dear
the
waiter
disappeared
with
a
little
bow
they
were
alone
at
last
she
held
his
hands
tightly
she
was
trembling
the
forced
composure
of
the
last
few
minutes
seemed
to
have
left
her
i
am
silly
she
faltered
but
the
servants
and
everything
they
come
back
will
they
he
laughed
as
he
patted
her
hand
we
sha
see
another
soul
dear
he
assured
her
she
laid
her
cheek
against
his
how
hot
your
face
feels
she
exclaimed
throw
open
the
window
do
i
sha
feel
it
he
obeyed
her
at
once
the
roar
of
the
city
all
its
harshness
muffled
came
to
them
in
a
sombre
almost
melodious
undernote
she
rested
her
hands
upon
his
shoulder
what
children
we
are
she
murmured
now
it
you
who
are
trembling
sit
down
please
you
been
so
brave
these
last
few
days
it
was
just
for
a
moment
he
told
her
it
seems
too
wonderful
i
had
a
sudden
impulse
of
terror
lest
it
should
all
be
snatched
away
she
laughed
easily
i
do
think
there
any
fear
of
that
dear
she
said
perhaps
there
was
a
little
knock
at
the
door
philip
who
had
been
holding
elizabeth
chair
stood
as
though
transfixed
elizabeth
gripped
at
the
side
of
the
table
it
was
some
few
seconds
before
either
of
them
spoke
it
perhaps
beatrice
elizabeth
faltered
the
knock
was
repeated
philip
drew
a
little
breath
come
in
he
invited
the
door
opened
slowly
towards
them
and
closed
again
it
was
dane
who
had
entered
from
outside
they
caught
a
momentary
glimpse
of
another
man
waiting
dane
took
off
his
hat
for
a
man
with
so
expressionless
a
countenance
he
was
looking
considerably
perturbed
miss
dalstan
he
said
i
am
very
sorry
believe
me
to
intrude
i
only
heard
of
your
marriage
an
hour
ago
i
wish
i
could
have
prevented
it
prevented
it
elizabeth
repeated
what
do
you
mean
i
think
that
philip
romilly
could
explain
dane
continued
turning
towards
philip
i
am
sorry
but
i
have
received
an
imperative
cable
from
scotland
yard
and
it
is
my
duty
to
arrest
you
philip
romilly
and
to
hold
you
pending
the
arrival
of
a
special
police
mission
from
england
i
am
bound
to
take
note
of
anything
you
may
say
so
i
beg
of
you
not
to
ask
me
any
particulars
as
to
the
charge
the
colour
slowly
faded
from
elizabeth
cheeks
she
had
risen
to
her
feet
and
was
gripping
the
mantelpiece
for
support
philip
however
was
perfectly
calm
he
poured
out
a
glass
of
water
and
held
it
to
her
lips
drink
this
dear
he
begged
and
do
be
alarmed
it
sounds
very
terrible
but
believe
me
there
is
nothing
to
be
feared
he
swung
suddenly
round
to
dane
his
voice
shook
with
passion
you
kept
me
under
observation
he
cried
all
this
time
i
attempted
to
escape
i
have
moved
from
new
york
i
have
the
slightest
intention
of
doing
so
until
this
thing
is
cleared
up
ca
you
take
my
parole
ca
you
leave
me
alone
until
they
come
from
england
dane
shook
his
head
slowly
he
was
a
hard
man
but
there
was
an
unaccustomed
look
of
distress
in
his
face
sorry
romilly
he
said
regretfully
i
did
suggest
something
of
the
sort
but
they
would
hear
of
it
at
headquarters
if
we
let
you
slip
through
our
fingers
we
should
never
hear
the
last
of
it
from
london
then
there
came
another
and
a
still
more
unexpected
interruption
from
outside
they
heard
beatrice
voice
raised
in
excitement
dane
stood
on
one
side
as
the
door
was
thrown
open
beatrice
suddenly
flung
herself
into
the
room
dragging
after
her
a
man
who
was
almost
breathless
i
say
beatrice
steady
the
latter
began
there
followed
the
most
wonderful
silence
in
the
world
a
silence
which
was
filled
with
throbbing
indescribable
emotions
a
silence
which
meant
something
different
for
every
one
of
them
beatrice
gripping
her
captive
by
the
wrist
was
looking
around
striving
to
understand
elizabeth
was
filled
with
blank
wonder
dane
was
puzzled
but
philip
who
a
moment
before
had
seemed
perfectly
composed
was
the
one
who
seemed
torn
by
indescribable
by
horrible
emotions
he
was
livid
almost
to
the
lips
his
hands
were
stretched
out
as
though
to
keep
from
him
some
awful
and
ghastly
vision
his
eyes
filled
with
the
anguished
light
of
supreme
terror
were
fastened
upon
the
newcomer
his
lips
shook
as
he
tried
to
speak
take
him
away
he
shrieked
oh
my
god
beatrice
more
coherent
than
any
of
them
scoffed
at
him
do
be
a
fool
she
cried
take
him
away
indeed
he
the
most
wonderful
thing
that
ever
happened
he
the
one
man
in
life
you
want
to
see
so
you
come
for
him
eh
she
went
on
turning
almost
like
a
on
dane
you
beast
you
chose
did
you
now
get
on
with
it
then
and
i
give
you
the
surprise
of
your
life
what
are
you
here
for
i
am
here
to
arrest
that
man
philip
romilly
for
the
murder
of
his
cousin
douglas
romilly
miss
wenderley
dane
announced
gravely
i
am
sorry
beatrice
threw
her
head
back
and
laughed
hysterically
you
never
write
a
play
like
it
philip
she
exclaimed
there
never
was
anything
like
it
before
now
dane
what
is
it
you
say
in
america
when
you
want
to
introduce
anybody
shake
hands
with
douglas
romilly
that
it
shake
hands
with
the
dead
man
here
and
then
get
on
with
your
arresting
he
must
be
dead
if
you
say
so
but
he
does
look
it
does
he
philip
face
had
become
a
more
natural
colour
his
eyes
had
never
left
the
other
man
he
swayed
a
little
on
his
feet
and
his
voice
seemed
to
him
to
come
from
a
long
way
off
douglas
it
is
you
douglas
it
is
you
really
i
wish
you
all
leave
off
staring
at
me
as
though
i
were
a
ghost
the
other
man
answered
almost
pettishly
i
douglas
romilly
right
enough
you
need
look
in
such
a
blue
funk
philip
he
went
on
his
fingers
mechanically
rearranging
his
collar
and
tie
which
beatrice
had
disarranged
i
served
you
a
beastly
trick
and
you
went
for
me
i
should
have
done
the
same
if
i
been
in
your
place
on
the
other
hand
i
rather
turned
the
tables
on
you
by
keeping
quiet
perhaps
it
up
to
me
to
explain
elizabeth
feeling
her
way
by
the
mantelpiece
came
to
philip
side
his
arm
supported
her
holding
her
as
though
in
a
vise
is
that
your
cousin
she
whispered
hoarsely
is
that
douglas
romilly
is
he
alive
after
all
philip
had
no
words
but
his
face
spoke
for
him
then
they
both
turned
to
listen
the
newcomer
had
dragged
a
chair
towards
him
and
was
leaning
over
the
back
of
it
he
addressed
philip
we
met
as
you
know
on
the
canal
path
that
beastly
afternoon
he
began
i
was
jolly
well
ashamed
of
myself
for
having
made
love
to
beatrice
and
all
the
rest
of
it
and
you
were
mad
with
rage
we
had
a
sort
of
tussle
and
you
threw
me
into
the
canal
it
was
a
nasty
dark
spot
just
underneath
the
bridge
i
expect
i
was
stunned
for
a
moment
but
it
was
only
for
a
moment
i
came
to
long
before
i
choked
and
when
i
remembered
your
grip
upon
my
throat
i
decided
i
was
safer
where
i
was
i
could
swim
like
a
duck
you
know
and
though
it
was
filthy
water
i
took
a
long
dive
when
i
came
up
again
gad
what
disgusting
water
it
was
you
were
tearing
off
like
a
creature
possessed
that
the
true
history
of
our
little
fracas
but
afterwards
philip
asked
wonderingly
what
happened
afterwards
you
just
tell
them
all
about
it
beatrice
ordered
him
sternly
go
on
douglas
well
you
see
douglas
romilly
continued
i
was
just
going
to
scramble
out
on
to
the
bank
when
my
brain
began
to
work
and
i
swam
slowly
along
instead
you
see
just
then
i
was
in
a
devil
of
a
mess
i
spent
a
lot
of
money
and
though
i
kept
the
credit
of
the
firm
good
i
knew
that
the
business
was
bust
and
the
one
thing
i
was
anxious
about
was
to
get
off
to
america
without
being
stopped
i
explained
this
all
to
beatrice
and
why
i
did
send
for
her
before
anyway
i
swam
along
until
i
met
with
an
old
barge
i
climbed
in
and
got
two
of
the
choicest
blackguards
you
ever
saw
to
let
me
spend
an
hour
or
two
in
their
filthy
cabin
and
to
keep
their
mouths
closed
about
it
fortunately
i
had
another
pocketbook
with
sufficient
to
satisfy
them
and
keep
me
going
then
i
borrowed
some
clothes
and
came
out
to
america
steerage
i
had
no
difficulty
in
getting
my
money
as
i
had
a
couple
of
pals
in
lynn
whom
i
had
fixed
things
up
with
before
i
started
they
came
and
identified
me
as
merton
ware
and
we
all
three
started
in
business
together
as
the
ford
boot
and
shoe
manufacturing
company
at
lynn
in
massachusetts
incidentally
we
done
all
right
heaps
more
of
course
but
that
the
pith
of
it
as
for
the
body
that
was
fished
out
of
the
canal
if
you
make
enquiries
you
find
there
was
a
tramp
missing
a
month
or
so
before
elizabeth
had
begun
to
sob
quietly
philip
who
was
holding
her
tenderly
in
his
arms
whispered
unheard
things
into
her
ears
it
was
beatrice
who
remained
in
charge
of
the
situation
so
now
dane
she
jeered
what
about
your
little
errand
i
hope
this
will
be
a
lesson
to
you
not
to
come
meddling
in
other
affairs
dane
turned
to
the
man
who
had
brought
this
bombshell
into
their
midst
do
you
swear
that
you
are
douglas
romilly
he
asked
i
not
only
swear
it
but
i
can
prove
it
if
you
come
along
with
me
to
murray
he
answered
my
partner
there
waiting
supper
and
another
man
who
has
known
me
all
his
life
the
detective
glanced
interrogatively
towards
philip
that
is
my
cousin
douglas
romilly
the
latter
pronounced
dane
took
up
his
hat
merton
ware
he
said
or
philip
romilly
whichever
you
may
in
future
elect
to
call
yourself
you
may
not
believe
it
but
the
end
of
this
affairs
is
an
immense
relief
to
me
i
offer
you
my
heartiest
congratulations
you
need
fear
no
more
annoyance
good
night
he
passed
out
they
heard
the
sound
of
his
footsteps
and
his
companion
as
they
crossed
the
corridor
and
rang
for
the
lift
speech
was
a
little
difficult
it
was
still
beatrice
who
imposed
conviction
upon
them
i
was
seated
in
the
box
she
explained
when
philip
went
round
to
see
you
elizabeth
i
had
looking
down
into
the
stalls
to
find
martha
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
saw
douglas
there
he
too
was
staring
at
me
of
course
i
thought
it
was
some
extraordinary
likeness
but
whilst
i
was
clutching
at
the
curtain
he
stood
up
and
waved
his
hand
you
should
have
seen
me
tear
from
the
box
you
know
ever
since
they
showed
me
that
signature
at
the
bank
i
have
had
a
queer
idea
at
the
back
of
my
head
luckily
for
him
she
went
patting
his
arm
he
sent
home
for
me
a
fortnight
ago
and
sent
a
draft
for
my
expenses
out
you
wo
mind
will
you
if
i
take
him
off
now
she
concluded
turning
to
elizabeth
they
are
waiting
supper
for
us
but
i
was
going
to
let
philip
did
you
know
that
dane
was
going
to
be
here
elizabeth
asked
not
an
idea
beatrice
declared
i
simply
dragged
douglas
along
here
as
soon
as
we
talked
things
out
because
i
knew
that
it
would
be
the
one
thing
wanting
to
complete
philip
happiness
we
leave
you
now
douglas
will
bring
me
back
and
we
are
going
to
be
married
in
a
few
days
philip
held
out
his
hand
a
little
diffidently
you
would
my
dear
fellow
douglas
interrupted
grasping
it
would
i
thundering
sorry
for
all
you
been
through
i
suppose
i
ought
to
have
let
you
know
that
i
was
still
in
the
land
of
the
living
but
i
was
waiting
until
things
blew
over
in
england
that
all
right
now
though
he
went
on
i
turned
over
a
new
leaf
and
i
am
making
money
making
it
after
a
style
they
do
understand
in
england
i
am
going
to
pay
my
creditors
twenty
shillings
in
the
pound
before
a
couple
of
years
have
gone
and
do
pretty
well
for
beatrice
and
myself
as
well
you
care
i
suppose
he
added
as
they
stood
there
with
locked
hands
to
offer
us
just
a
glass
of
wine
before
we
start
out
beatrice
has
been
riddling
me
with
questions
and
dragging
me
through
the
streets
till
i
scarcely
know
whether
i
am
on
my
head
or
my
heels
philip
emptied
the
contents
of
the
champagne
bottle
into
the
glasses
never
was
wine
poured
out
more
gladly
douglas
he
explained
this
is
miss
elizabeth
dalstan
whom
you
saw
act
this
evening
we
were
married
this
afternoon
you
can
understand
ca
you
just
what
your
coming
has
meant
for
us
douglas
shook
elizabeth
by
the
hand
then
he
held
up
his
glass
here
the
best
of
luck
to
you
both
he
said
heartily
very
soon
beatrice
and
i
will
ask
you
to
wish
us
the
same
philip
old
chap
he
added
as
he
set
his
glass
down
and
without
the
slightest
protest
watched
it
replenished
that
a
thundering
good
play
of
yours
i
seen
this
evening
but
you
never
write
one
to
beat
this
soon
beatrice
and
douglas
also
took
their
departure
elizabeth
held
out
her
arms
almost
as
the
door
closed
the
were
still
on
her
cheeks
her
lips
quivered
a
little
but
her
voice
was
clear
and
sweet
and
passionate
philip
she
cried
it
all
over
it
all
finished
with
the
dread
the
awful
days
i
am
not
going
to
be
hysterical
any
more
and
you
you
are
just
going
to
remember
that
we
have
everything
we
want
in
the
world
sit
down
opposite
to
me
if
you
please
and
fill
my
glass
i
have
only
one
emotion
left
i
am
hungry
desperately
hungry
move
your
chair
nearer
so
that
i
can
reach
your
hand
there
now
you
and
i
will
drink
our
little
toast
it
was
an
hour
before
they
thought
of
leaving
the
table
a
very
perplexed
waiter
brought
them
coffee
and
watched
them
light
cigarettes
then
the
telephone
bell
rang
they
both
stared
at
the
instrument
philip
would
have
taken
off
the
receiver
but
elizabeth
held
out
her
hand
i
have
an
idea
she
said
i
believe
it
is
from
sylvanus
power
let
me
answer
it
she
held
the
receiver
to
her
ear
and
listened
yes
she
murmured
yes
at
what
time
her
face
grew
more
puzzled
she
listened
for
a
moment
longer
but
sylvanus
she
expostulated
what
do
you
mean
sylvanus
mr
power
the
telephone
had
become
a
dumb
thing
she
replaced
the
receiver
i
do
understand
she
told
philip
all
that
he
said
was
will
receive
my
present
at
five
this
morning
does
he
think
we
are
going
to
sit
up
for
it
philip
asked
he
is
the
strangest
man
she
sighed
after
all
some
queer
fancy
awoke
philip
at
a
little
before
five
that
morning
and
drew
him
to
the
window
he
sat
looking
out
over
the
still
sleeping
city
all
sound
now
was
hushed
it
was
the
brief
breathing
space
before
the
dawn
in
the
clear
morning
spring
light
the
buildings
of
the
city
seemed
to
stand
out
with
a
new
and
marvellous
distinctness
now
and
then
from
the
harbour
came
the
shriek
of
a
siren
a
few
pale
lights
were
still
burning
along
the
river
way
from
one
of
the
city
clocks
the
hour
was
slowly
tolled
philip
counted
the
strokes
one
two
three
four
five
then
almost
as
he
was
preparing
to
leave
his
post
there
came
a
terrific
roar
the
window
against
which
he
leaned
shook
some
of
the
buildings
in
the
distance
trembled
one
with
its
familiar
white
cupola
seemed
for
a
moment
to
be
lifted
from
the
ground
and
then
split
through
by
some
unseen
hand
the
roar
of
the
explosion
was
followed
by
the
crashing
of
falling
masonry
long
fingers
of
fire
suddenly
leapt
up
into
the
quiet
cool
air
fragments
of
masonry
a
portion
even
of
that
wonderful
cupola
came
crashing
down
into
the
street
he
heard
elizabeth
voice
behind
him
felt
her
fingers
upon
his
shoulder
what
is
it
philip
what
is
it
he
pointed
with
steady
finger
the
truth
seemed
to
come
to
him
by
inspiration
it
is
sylvanus
power
message
to
you
he
replied
the
theatre
there
were
flames
now
leaping
up
to
the
sky
together
they
watched
them
and
listened
to
the
shrieking
of
sirens
and
whistles
as
the
fire
engines
galloped
by
from
every
section
of
the
city
there
was
a
strange
look
in
elizabeth
face
as
she
watched
the
curling
flames
philip
she
whispered
thank
god
there
it
goes
all
his
great
offering
to
me
it
like
the
man
and
his
motto
man
may
do
what
he
will
with
his
own
only
last
night
i
felt
as
though
i
would
give
anything
in
the
world
never
to
stand
upon
the
stage
of
that
theatre
again
he
does
know
it
philip
but
his
is
a
precious
gift
he
passed
his
arm
around
her
and
drew
her
from
the
window
man
may
do
what
he
will
with
his
own
he
repeated
well
it
such
a
bad
motto
sylvanus
power
may
destroy
a
theatre
for
a
whim
but
so
far
as
you
and
i
are
concerned
she
sighed
with
content
we
do
both
need
a
holiday
she
murmured
somewhere
in
europe
i
think
the
end
