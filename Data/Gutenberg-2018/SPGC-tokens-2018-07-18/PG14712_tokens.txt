vandover
and
the
brute
by
frank
norris
chapter
one
it
was
always
a
matter
of
wonder
to
vandover
that
he
was
able
to
recall
so
little
of
his
past
life
with
the
exception
of
the
most
recent
events
he
could
remember
nothing
connectedly
what
he
at
first
imagined
to
be
the
story
of
his
life
on
closer
inspection
turned
out
to
be
but
a
few
disconnected
incidents
that
his
memory
had
preserved
with
the
greatest
capriciousness
absolutely
independent
of
their
importance
one
of
these
incidents
might
be
a
great
sorrow
a
tragedy
a
death
in
his
family
and
another
recalled
with
the
same
vividness
the
same
accuracy
of
detail
might
be
a
matter
of
the
least
moment
a
certain
one
of
these
wilful
fillips
of
memory
would
always
bring
before
him
a
particular
scene
during
the
migration
of
his
family
from
boston
to
their
new
home
in
san
francisco
at
a
time
when
vandover
was
about
eight
years
old
it
was
in
the
depot
of
one
of
the
larger
towns
in
western
new
york
the
day
had
been
hot
and
after
the
long
ride
on
the
crowded
day
coach
the
cool
shadow
under
the
curved
roof
of
the
immense
iron
vaulted
depot
seemed
very
pleasant
the
porter
the
brakeman
and
vandover
father
very
carefully
lifted
his
mother
from
the
car
she
was
lying
back
on
pillows
in
a
long
steamer
chair
the
three
men
let
the
chair
slowly
down
the
brakeman
went
away
but
the
porter
remained
taking
off
his
cap
and
wiping
his
forehead
with
the
back
of
his
left
hand
which
in
turn
he
wiped
against
the
pink
palm
of
his
right
the
other
train
the
train
to
which
they
were
to
change
had
not
yet
arrived
it
was
rather
still
at
the
far
end
of
the
depot
a
locomotive
sitting
back
on
its
motionless
drivers
like
some
huge
sphinx
crouching
along
the
rails
was
steaming
quietly
drawing
long
breaths
the
repair
gang
in
greasy
caps
and
spotted
blue
overalls
were
inspecting
the
train
pottering
about
the
trucks
opening
and
closing
the
striking
clear
notes
on
the
wheels
with
hammers
vandover
stood
close
to
his
father
his
thin
legs
wide
apart
holding
in
both
his
hands
the
satchel
he
had
been
permitted
to
carry
he
looked
about
him
continually
rolling
his
big
eyes
vaguely
watching
now
the
now
a
huge
white
cat
dozing
on
an
empty
baggage
truck
several
passengers
were
walking
up
and
down
the
platform
staring
curiously
at
the
invalid
lying
back
in
the
steamer
chair
the
journey
was
too
much
for
her
she
was
very
weak
and
very
pale
her
eyelids
were
heavy
the
skin
of
her
forehead
looked
blue
and
tightly
drawn
and
tiny
beads
of
perspiration
gathered
around
the
corners
of
her
mouth
vandover
father
put
his
hand
and
arm
along
the
back
of
the
chair
and
his
sick
wife
rested
against
him
leaning
her
head
on
his
waistcoat
over
the
pocket
where
he
kept
his
cigars
and
they
were
all
silent
by
and
by
she
drew
a
long
sigh
her
face
became
the
face
of
an
imbecile
stupid
without
expression
her
eyes
her
mouth
her
head
rolled
forward
as
though
she
were
nodding
in
her
sleep
while
a
long
drip
of
saliva
trailed
from
her
lower
lip
vandover
father
bent
over
her
quickly
crying
out
sharply
hallie
what
is
it
all
at
once
the
train
for
which
they
were
waiting
charged
into
the
depot
filling
the
place
with
a
hideous
clangor
and
with
the
smell
of
steam
and
of
hot
oil
this
scene
of
her
death
was
the
only
thing
that
vandover
could
remember
of
his
mother
as
he
looked
back
over
his
life
he
could
recall
nothing
after
this
for
nearly
five
years
even
after
that
lapse
of
time
the
only
scene
he
could
picture
with
any
degree
of
clearness
was
one
of
the
greatest
triviality
in
which
he
saw
himself
a
rank
boy
sitting
on
a
bit
of
carpet
in
the
back
yard
of
the
san
francisco
house
playing
with
his
in
order
to
get
at
his
life
during
his
teens
vandover
would
have
been
obliged
to
collect
these
scattered
memory
pictures
as
best
he
could
rearrange
them
in
some
more
orderly
sequence
piece
out
what
he
could
imperfectly
recall
and
fill
in
the
many
gaps
by
mere
guesswork
and
conjecture
it
was
the
summer
of
that
they
had
come
to
san
francisco
once
settled
there
vandover
father
began
to
build
small
residence
houses
and
cheap
flats
which
he
rented
at
various
prices
the
cheapest
at
ten
dollars
the
more
expensive
at
and
forty
he
had
closed
out
his
business
in
the
east
coming
out
to
california
on
account
of
his
wife
ill
health
he
had
made
his
money
in
boston
and
had
intended
to
retire
but
he
soon
found
that
he
could
not
do
this
at
this
time
he
was
an
old
man
nearly
sixty
he
had
given
his
entire
life
to
his
business
to
the
exclusion
of
everything
else
and
now
when
his
fortune
had
been
made
and
when
he
could
afford
to
enjoy
it
discovered
that
he
had
lost
the
capacity
for
enjoying
anything
but
the
business
itself
nothing
else
could
interest
him
he
was
not
what
would
be
called
in
america
a
rich
man
but
he
had
made
money
enough
to
travel
to
allow
himself
any
reasonable
relaxation
to
cultivate
a
taste
for
art
music
literature
or
the
drama
to
indulge
in
any
harmless
fad
such
as
collecting
etchings
china
or
or
even
to
permit
himself
the
luxury
of
horses
in
the
place
of
all
these
he
found
himself
at
nearly
sixty
years
of
age
forced
again
into
the
sordid
round
of
business
as
the
only
escape
from
the
mortal
and
weariness
of
the
spirit
that
preyed
upon
him
during
every
leisure
hour
of
the
day
early
and
late
he
went
about
the
city
personally
superintending
the
building
of
his
little
houses
and
cheap
flats
sitting
on
and
piles
of
lumber
watching
the
carpenters
at
work
in
the
evening
he
came
home
to
a
late
supper
completely
fagged
bringing
with
him
the
smell
of
mortar
and
of
pine
shavings
on
the
first
of
each
month
when
his
agents
turned
over
the
rents
to
him
he
was
in
great
spirits
he
would
bring
home
the
little
canvas
sack
of
coin
with
him
before
banking
it
and
call
his
son
attention
to
the
amount
never
failing
to
stick
a
in
each
eye
monocle
fashion
exclaiming
good
for
the
masses
a
meaningless
jest
that
had
been
one
of
the
family
household
words
for
years
his
plan
of
building
was
peculiar
his
credit
was
good
and
having
chosen
his
lot
he
would
find
out
from
the
banks
how
much
they
would
loan
him
upon
it
in
case
he
should
become
the
owner
if
this
amount
suited
him
he
would
buy
the
lot
making
one
large
payment
outright
and
giving
his
note
for
the
balance
the
lot
once
his
the
banks
loaned
him
the
desired
amount
with
this
money
and
with
money
of
his
own
he
would
make
the
final
payment
on
the
lot
and
would
begin
the
building
itself
paying
his
labour
on
the
nail
but
getting
his
material
lumber
brick
and
fittings
on
time
when
the
building
was
up
he
would
negotiate
a
second
loan
from
the
banks
in
order
to
complete
it
and
in
order
to
meet
the
notes
he
had
given
to
his
contractors
for
material
he
believed
this
to
be
a
shrewd
business
operation
since
the
rents
as
they
returned
to
him
were
equal
to
the
interest
on
a
far
larger
sum
than
that
which
he
had
originally
invested
he
said
little
about
the
double
mortgage
on
each
piece
of
property
improved
after
this
fashion
and
which
often
represented
a
full
of
its
entire
value
the
interest
on
each
loan
was
far
more
than
covered
by
the
rents
he
chose
his
neighbourhoods
with
great
discrimination
real
estate
was
flourishing
in
the
rapidly
growing
city
and
the
new
houses
although
built
so
cheaply
that
they
were
mere
shells
of
lath
and
plaster
were
nevertheless
made
gay
and
brave
with
varnish
and
cheap
they
rented
well
at
first
scarcely
a
one
was
ever
vacant
people
spoke
of
the
old
gentleman
as
one
of
the
most
successful
realty
owners
in
the
city
so
pleased
did
he
become
with
the
success
of
his
new
venture
that
in
course
of
time
all
his
money
was
reinvested
after
this
fashion
at
the
time
of
his
father
greatest
prosperity
vandover
himself
began
to
draw
toward
his
fifteenth
year
entering
upon
that
period
of
change
when
the
first
raw
elements
of
character
began
to
assert
themselves
and
when
if
ever
there
was
a
crying
need
for
the
influence
of
his
mother
any
feminine
influence
would
have
been
well
for
him
at
this
time
that
of
an
older
sister
even
that
of
a
hired
governess
the
housekeeper
looked
after
him
a
little
mended
his
clothes
saw
that
he
took
his
bath
saturday
nights
and
that
he
did
not
dig
tunnels
under
the
garden
walks
but
her
influence
was
entirely
negative
and
prohibitory
and
the
two
were
constantly
at
war
vandover
grew
in
a
haphazard
way
and
after
school
hours
ran
about
the
streets
almost
at
will
at
fifteen
he
put
on
long
trousers
and
the
fall
of
the
same
year
entered
the
high
school
he
had
grown
too
fast
and
at
this
time
was
tall
and
very
lean
his
limbs
were
straight
angular
out
of
all
proportion
with
huge
articulations
at
the
elbows
and
knees
his
neck
was
long
and
thin
and
his
head
large
his
face
was
sallow
and
covered
with
pimples
his
ears
were
big
red
and
stuck
out
stiff
from
either
side
of
his
head
his
hair
he
wore
pompadour
within
a
month
after
his
entry
of
the
high
school
he
had
a
nickname
the
boys
called
him
to
his
infinite
humiliation
little
by
little
the
crude
virility
of
the
young
man
began
to
develop
in
him
it
was
a
distressing
uncanny
period
had
vandover
been
a
girl
he
would
at
this
time
have
been
subject
to
all
sorts
of
abnormal
vagaries
such
as
eating
his
slate
pencil
nibbling
bits
of
chalk
wishing
he
were
dead
and
drifting
into
states
of
unreasoned
melancholy
as
it
was
his
voice
began
to
change
a
little
golden
down
appeared
on
his
cheeks
and
upon
the
nape
of
his
neck
while
his
first
summer
vacation
was
altogether
spoiled
by
a
long
spell
of
mumps
his
appetite
was
enormous
he
ate
heavy
meat
three
times
a
day
but
took
little
or
no
exercise
the
pimples
on
his
face
became
worse
and
worse
he
grew
peevish
and
nervous
he
hated
girls
and
when
in
their
society
was
a
very
for
bashfulness
and
awkward
at
times
the
strangest
and
most
morbid
fancies
took
possession
of
him
chief
of
which
was
that
every
one
was
looking
at
him
while
he
was
walking
in
the
street
vandover
was
a
good
little
boy
every
night
he
said
his
prayers
going
down
upon
his
huge
knees
at
the
side
of
his
bed
to
the
lord
prayer
he
added
various
petitions
of
his
own
he
prayed
that
he
might
be
a
good
boy
and
live
a
long
time
and
go
to
heaven
when
he
died
and
see
his
mother
that
the
next
saturday
might
be
sunny
all
day
long
and
that
the
end
of
the
world
might
not
come
while
he
was
alive
it
was
during
vandover
first
year
at
the
high
school
that
his
eyes
were
opened
and
that
he
acquired
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
till
very
late
he
kept
his
innocence
the
crude
raw
innocence
of
the
boy
like
that
of
a
young
animal
at
once
charming
and
absurd
but
by
and
by
he
became
very
curious
stirred
with
a
blind
unreasoned
instinct
in
the
bible
which
he
read
sunday
afternoons
because
his
father
gave
him
a
quarter
for
doing
so
he
came
across
a
great
many
things
that
filled
him
with
vague
and
strange
ideas
and
one
sunday
at
church
when
the
minister
was
intoning
the
litany
he
remarked
for
the
first
time
the
words
all
women
in
the
perils
of
he
puzzled
over
this
for
a
long
time
smelling
out
a
mystery
beneath
the
words
feeling
the
presence
of
something
hidden
with
the
instinct
of
a
young
brute
he
could
get
no
satisfaction
from
his
father
and
by
and
by
began
to
be
ashamed
to
ask
him
why
he
did
not
know
although
he
could
not
help
hearing
the
abominable
talk
of
the
high
school
boys
he
at
first
refused
to
believe
that
part
of
it
which
he
could
understand
for
all
that
he
was
ashamed
of
his
innocence
and
ignorance
and
affected
to
appreciate
their
stories
nevertheless
at
length
one
day
he
heard
the
terse
and
brutal
truth
in
an
instant
he
believed
it
some
lower
animal
intuition
in
him
reiterating
and
confirming
the
fact
but
even
then
he
hated
to
think
that
people
were
so
low
so
vile
one
day
however
he
was
looking
through
the
volumes
of
the
old
encyclopædia
britannica
in
his
father
library
hoping
that
he
might
find
a
dollar
bill
which
the
old
gentleman
told
him
had
been
at
one
time
misplaced
between
the
leaves
of
some
one
of
the
great
tomes
all
at
once
he
came
upon
the
long
article
obstetrics
profusely
illustrated
with
plates
and
steel
engravings
he
read
it
from
beginning
to
end
it
was
the
end
of
all
his
childish
ideals
the
destruction
of
all
his
first
illusions
the
whole
of
his
rude
little
standard
of
morality
was
lowered
immediately
even
his
mother
whom
he
had
always
believed
to
be
some
kind
of
an
angel
fell
at
once
in
his
estimation
she
could
never
be
the
same
to
him
after
this
never
so
sweet
so
good
and
so
pure
as
he
had
hitherto
imagined
her
it
was
very
cruel
the
whole
thing
was
a
grief
to
him
a
blow
a
great
shock
he
hated
to
think
of
it
then
little
by
little
the
first
taint
crept
in
the
innate
vice
stirred
in
him
the
brute
began
to
make
itself
felt
and
a
multitude
of
perverse
and
vicious
ideas
commenced
to
buzz
about
him
like
a
swarm
of
nasty
flies
a
certain
word
the
blunt
name
for
a
lost
woman
that
he
heard
on
one
occasion
among
the
boys
at
school
opened
to
him
a
vista
of
incredible
wickedness
but
now
after
the
first
moment
of
revolt
the
thing
began
to
seem
less
horrible
there
was
even
a
certain
attraction
about
it
vandover
soon
became
filled
with
an
overwhelming
curiosity
the
eager
evil
curiosity
of
the
schoolboy
the
perverse
craving
for
the
knowledge
of
vice
he
listened
with
all
his
ears
to
everything
that
was
said
and
went
about
through
the
great
city
with
eyes
open
only
to
its
foulness
he
even
looked
up
in
the
dictionary
the
meanings
of
the
new
words
finding
in
the
cold
scientific
definitions
some
strange
sort
of
satisfaction
there
was
no
feminine
influence
about
vandover
at
this
critical
time
to
help
him
see
the
world
in
the
right
light
and
to
gauge
things
correctly
and
he
might
have
been
totally
corrupted
while
in
his
earliest
teens
had
it
not
been
for
another
side
of
his
character
that
began
to
develop
about
the
same
time
this
was
his
artistic
side
he
seemed
to
be
a
born
artist
at
first
he
only
showed
bent
for
all
general
art
he
drew
well
he
made
curious
little
modellings
in
clayey
mud
he
had
a
capital
ear
for
music
and
managed
in
some
unknown
way
of
his
own
to
pick
out
certain
tunes
on
the
piano
at
one
time
he
gave
evidence
of
a
genuine
talent
for
the
stage
for
days
he
would
pretend
to
be
some
dreadful
sort
of
character
he
did
not
know
whom
talking
to
himself
stamping
and
shaking
his
fists
then
he
would
dress
himself
in
an
old
a
red
and
one
of
his
father
discarded
templar
swords
and
pose
before
the
long
mirrors
ranting
and
scowling
at
another
time
he
would
devote
his
attention
to
literature
making
up
endless
stories
with
which
he
terrified
himself
telling
them
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
for
hours
after
he
had
got
into
bed
sometimes
he
would
write
out
these
stories
and
read
them
to
his
father
after
supper
standing
up
between
the
folding
doors
of
the
library
acting
out
the
whole
narrative
with
furious
gestures
once
he
even
wrote
a
little
poem
which
seriously
disturbed
the
old
gentleman
filling
him
with
formless
ideas
and
vague
hopes
for
the
future
in
a
suitable
environment
vandover
might
easily
have
become
an
author
actor
or
musician
since
it
was
evident
that
he
possessed
the
fundamental
that
underlies
all
branches
of
art
as
it
was
the
merest
chance
decided
his
career
in
the
same
library
where
he
had
found
the
famous
encyclopædia
article
was
a
home
book
of
art
one
of
those
showily
bound
gift
books
one
sees
lying
about
conspicuously
on
parlour
centre
tables
it
was
an
english
publication
calculated
to
meet
popular
and
general
demand
there
were
a
great
many
pictures
of
lonely
women
called
reveries
or
idylls
ideal
heads
of
gipsy
girls
of
coquettes
and
heads
of
little
girls
crowned
with
cherries
and
illustrative
of
such
titles
as
spring
youth
innocence
besides
these
were
sentimental
pictures
as
for
instance
one
entitled
it
might
have
been
a
girl
with
long
hair
musing
over
a
miniature
portrait
and
another
especially
impressive
which
represented
a
handsomely
dressed
woman
flung
upon
a
sofa
weeping
her
hands
clasped
over
her
head
she
was
alone
it
was
twilight
on
the
floor
was
a
heap
of
opened
letters
the
picture
was
called
memories
vandover
thought
this
last
a
wonderful
work
of
art
and
made
a
hideous
copy
of
it
with
very
soft
pencils
he
was
so
pleased
with
it
that
he
copied
another
one
of
the
pictures
and
then
another
by
and
by
he
had
copied
almost
all
of
them
his
father
gave
him
a
dollar
and
vandover
began
to
add
to
his
usual
evening
petition
the
prayer
that
he
might
become
a
great
artist
thus
it
was
that
his
career
was
decided
upon
he
was
allowed
to
have
a
drawing
teacher
this
was
an
elderly
german
an
immense
old
fellow
who
wore
a
wig
and
breathed
loudly
through
his
nose
his
voice
was
like
a
trumpet
and
he
walked
with
a
great
striding
gait
like
a
colonel
of
cavalry
besides
drawing
he
taught
ornamental
writing
and
engrossing
with
a
dozen
curved
and
flowing
strokes
of
an
ordinary
writing
pen
he
could
draw
upon
a
calling
card
a
conventionalized
of
some
kind
of
dove
or
bird
of
paradise
all
curves
and
curlicues
flying
very
gracefully
and
carrying
in
its
beak
a
scroll
upon
which
could
be
inscribed
such
sentiments
as
from
a
friend
or
with
fond
regards
or
even
one
own
name
his
system
of
drawing
was
of
his
own
invention
over
the
picture
to
be
copied
he
would
paste
a
great
sheet
of
paper
ruling
off
the
same
into
spaces
of
about
an
inch
square
he
would
cut
out
one
of
these
squares
and
vandover
would
copy
the
portion
of
the
picture
thus
disclosed
when
he
had
copied
the
whole
picture
in
this
fashion
the
teacher
would
go
over
it
himself
retouching
it
here
and
there
labouring
to
obviate
the
effect
which
the
process
invariably
produced
at
other
times
vandover
copied
into
his
with
hard
crayons
those
lithographed
studies
on
buff
paper
which
are
published
by
the
firm
in
berlin
he
began
with
ladders
and
water
barrels
working
up
in
course
of
time
to
rustic
buildings
set
in
a
bit
of
landscape
stone
bridges
and
rural
mills
overhung
by
some
sort
of
linden
tree
with
ends
of
broken
fences
in
a
corner
of
the
foreground
to
complete
the
composition
from
these
he
went
on
to
bunches
of
grapes
vases
of
fruit
and
at
length
to
more
ideal
heads
the
climax
was
reached
with
a
head
crowned
with
honeysuckles
and
entitled
flora
he
was
three
weeks
upon
it
it
was
an
achievement
a
veritable
vandover
gave
it
to
his
father
upon
christmas
morning
having
signed
his
name
to
it
with
a
great
ornamental
flourish
the
old
gentleman
was
astounded
the
housekeeper
was
called
in
and
exclaimed
over
it
raising
her
hands
to
heaven
vandover
father
gave
him
a
fresh
from
the
mint
had
the
picture
framed
in
gilt
and
hung
it
up
in
his
over
the
clock
never
for
a
moment
did
the
old
gentleman
oppose
vandover
wish
to
become
an
artist
and
it
was
he
himself
who
first
spoke
about
paris
to
the
young
man
vandover
was
delighted
the
latin
quarter
became
his
dream
between
the
two
it
was
arranged
that
he
should
go
over
as
soon
as
he
had
finished
his
course
at
the
high
school
the
old
gentleman
was
to
take
him
across
returning
only
when
he
was
well
established
in
some
suitable
studio
at
length
vandover
graduated
and
within
three
weeks
of
that
event
was
on
his
way
to
europe
with
his
father
he
never
got
farther
than
boston
at
the
last
moment
the
old
gentleman
wavered
vandover
was
still
very
young
and
would
be
entirely
alone
in
paris
ignorant
of
the
language
exposed
to
every
temptation
besides
this
his
education
would
stop
where
it
was
somehow
he
could
not
make
it
seem
right
to
him
to
cut
the
young
man
adrift
in
this
fashion
on
the
other
hand
the
old
gentleman
had
a
great
many
friends
and
business
acquaintances
in
boston
who
could
be
trusted
with
a
nominal
supervision
of
his
son
for
four
years
he
had
no
college
education
himself
but
in
some
vague
way
he
felt
convinced
that
vandover
would
be
a
better
artist
for
a
four
course
at
harvard
vandover
took
his
father
decision
hardly
he
had
never
thought
of
being
a
and
nothing
in
that
life
appealed
to
him
he
urged
upon
his
father
the
loss
of
time
that
the
course
would
entail
but
his
father
met
this
objection
by
offering
to
pay
for
any
artistic
tuition
that
would
not
interfere
with
the
regular
college
work
little
by
little
the
idea
of
college
life
became
more
attractive
to
vandover
at
the
worst
it
was
only
postponing
the
paris
trip
not
abandoning
it
besides
this
two
of
his
chums
from
the
high
school
were
expecting
to
enter
harvard
that
fall
and
he
could
look
forward
to
a
very
pleasant
four
years
spent
in
their
company
out
at
cambridge
the
term
was
just
closing
the
old
gentleman
friends
procured
him
tickets
to
several
of
the
more
important
functions
from
the
gallery
of
memorial
hall
vandover
and
his
father
saw
some
of
the
great
dinners
they
went
up
to
new
london
for
the
they
gained
admittance
to
the
historic
yard
on
and
saw
the
strange
football
rush
for
flowers
around
the
tree
they
heard
the
seniors
sing
fair
harvard
for
the
last
time
and
later
saw
them
receive
their
diplomas
at
sander
theatre
the
great
ceremonies
of
the
place
the
picturesqueness
of
the
yard
the
old
red
dormitories
covered
with
ivy
the
associations
and
traditions
of
the
buildings
the
venerable
pump
longfellow
room
the
lecture
hall
where
the
had
barracked
all
of
these
things
in
the
end
appealed
strongly
to
vandover
imagination
instead
of
passing
the
summer
months
in
an
ocean
voyage
and
a
continental
journey
he
at
last
became
content
to
settle
down
to
work
under
a
tutor
boning
up
for
the
examinations
his
father
returned
to
san
francisco
in
july
vandover
matriculated
the
september
of
the
same
year
on
the
first
of
october
he
signed
the
college
rolls
and
became
a
harvard
freshman
at
that
time
he
was
eighteen
years
old
chapter
two
there
was
little
of
the
stubborn
or
unyielding
about
vandover
his
personality
was
not
strong
his
nature
pliable
and
he
rearranged
himself
to
suit
his
new
environment
at
harvard
very
rapidly
before
the
end
of
the
first
semester
he
had
become
to
all
outward
appearances
a
typical
harvardian
he
wore
corduroy
vests
and
a
gray
felt
hat
the
brim
turned
down
over
his
eyes
he
smoked
a
pipe
and
bought
himself
a
brindled
he
cut
his
lectures
as
often
as
he
dared
ragged
signs
and
and
was
in
continual
evidence
about
foster
and
among
leavitt
and
pierce
when
the
great
football
games
came
off
he
worked
himself
into
a
frenzy
of
excitement
over
them
and
even
tried
to
make
several
of
his
class
teams
though
without
success
he
chummed
with
charlie
geary
and
with
young
dolliver
haight
the
two
san
francisco
boys
the
three
were
continually
together
they
took
the
same
courses
dined
at
the
same
table
in
memorial
hall
and
would
have
shared
the
same
room
if
it
had
been
possible
vandover
and
charlie
geary
were
fortunate
enough
to
get
a
room
in
matthew
on
the
lower
floor
looking
out
upon
the
yard
young
haight
was
obliged
to
put
up
with
an
outside
room
in
a
boarding
house
vandover
had
grown
up
with
these
fellows
and
during
all
his
life
was
thrown
in
their
company
haight
was
a
young
boy
of
good
family
very
quiet
almost
every
morning
he
went
to
chapel
he
was
always
polite
even
to
his
two
friends
he
invariably
tried
to
be
pleasant
and
agreeable
and
had
a
way
of
making
people
like
him
otherwise
his
character
was
not
strongly
marked
geary
was
quite
different
he
never
could
forget
himself
he
was
incessantly
talking
about
what
he
had
done
or
was
going
to
do
in
the
morning
he
would
inform
vandover
of
how
many
hours
he
had
slept
and
of
the
dreams
he
had
dreamed
in
the
evening
he
would
tell
him
everything
he
had
done
that
day
the
things
he
had
said
how
many
lectures
he
had
cut
what
brilliant
recitations
he
had
made
and
even
what
food
he
had
eaten
at
memorial
he
was
pushing
very
shrewd
and
clever
devoured
with
an
inordinate
ambition
and
particularly
pleased
when
he
could
get
the
better
of
anybody
even
of
vandover
or
of
young
haight
he
delighted
to
assume
the
management
of
things
vandover
he
made
his
protégé
taking
over
the
charge
of
such
business
as
the
two
had
in
common
it
was
he
who
had
found
the
room
in
matthew
getting
it
away
from
all
other
applicants
securing
it
at
the
eleventh
hour
he
put
vandover
name
on
the
waiting
list
at
memorial
saw
that
he
filled
out
his
blanks
at
the
proper
time
helped
him
balance
his
accounts
guided
him
in
the
choice
of
his
courses
and
in
the
making
out
of
his
look
here
charlie
vandover
would
exclaim
throwing
down
the
announcement
of
courses
i
ca
make
this
thing
out
it
all
in
a
tangle
see
here
i
got
to
fill
up
my
hours
some
way
or
other
straighten
this
thing
out
for
me
find
me
some
nice
little
course
two
hours
a
week
say
that
comes
late
in
the
morning
a
good
hour
after
breakfast
something
easy
all
lectures
no
outside
reading
nice
instructor
and
all
that
and
geary
would
glance
over
the
complicated
schedule
cleverly
untangling
it
at
once
and
would
find
two
or
three
such
courses
as
vandover
desired
vandover
yielding
disposition
led
him
to
submit
to
dictatorship
and
he
thus
early
began
to
contract
easy
irresponsible
habits
becoming
indolent
shirking
his
duty
whenever
he
could
sure
that
geary
would
think
for
the
two
and
pull
him
out
of
any
difficulty
into
which
he
might
drift
otherwise
the
three
freshmen
were
very
much
alike
they
were
hardly
more
than
boys
and
full
of
boyish
spirits
and
activity
they
began
to
see
college
life
vandover
was
already
smoking
pretty
soon
he
began
to
drink
he
affected
beer
whisky
he
loathed
and
such
wine
as
was
not
too
expensive
was
either
too
sweet
or
too
sour
it
became
a
custom
for
the
three
to
go
into
town
two
or
three
nights
in
the
week
and
have
beer
and
welsh
rabbits
at
billy
park
on
these
occasions
however
young
haight
drank
only
beer
he
never
touched
wine
or
spirits
it
was
in
billy
park
the
evening
after
the
football
game
between
the
yale
and
harvard
freshmen
that
vandover
was
drunk
for
the
first
time
he
was
not
so
drunk
but
that
he
knew
he
was
and
the
knowledge
of
the
fact
so
terrified
him
that
it
kept
him
from
getting
very
bad
the
first
sensation
soon
wore
off
and
by
the
time
that
geary
took
charge
of
him
and
brought
him
back
to
cambridge
he
was
disposed
to
treat
the
affair
less
seriously
nevertheless
when
he
got
to
his
room
he
looked
at
himself
in
the
mirror
a
long
time
saying
to
himself
over
and
over
again
i
drunk
just
regularly
drunk
good
heavens
what
the
governor
say
to
in
the
morning
he
was
surprised
to
find
that
he
felt
so
little
ashamed
geary
and
young
haight
treated
the
matter
as
a
huge
joke
and
told
him
of
certain
funny
things
he
had
said
and
done
and
which
he
had
entirely
forgotten
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
take
the
matter
seriously
even
if
he
had
wished
to
and
within
a
few
weeks
he
was
drunk
again
he
found
that
he
was
not
an
exception
geary
was
often
drunk
with
him
fully
a
third
of
all
the
harvard
men
he
knew
were
intoxicated
at
different
times
it
was
out
of
the
question
for
vandover
to
consider
them
as
drunkards
certainly
neither
he
nor
any
of
the
others
drank
because
they
liked
the
beer
after
the
fifth
or
sixth
glass
it
was
all
they
could
do
to
force
down
another
such
being
the
case
vandover
often
asked
himself
why
he
got
drunk
at
all
this
question
he
was
never
able
to
answer
it
was
the
same
with
gambling
at
first
the
idea
of
playing
cards
for
money
shocked
him
beyond
all
expression
but
soon
he
found
that
a
great
many
of
the
fellows
fellows
like
young
haight
beyond
question
steady
sensible
and
even
worthy
of
emulation
in
other
ways
went
in
for
that
sort
of
thing
every
now
and
then
vandover
crowd
got
together
in
his
room
in
matthew
and
played
van
john
for
keeps
as
they
said
until
far
into
the
night
vandover
joined
them
the
stakes
were
small
he
lost
as
often
as
he
won
but
the
habit
of
the
cards
never
grew
upon
him
it
was
like
the
beer
he
went
in
for
it
because
the
others
did
without
knowing
why
geary
however
drew
his
line
at
gambling
he
never
talked
against
it
or
tried
to
influence
vandover
but
he
never
could
be
induced
to
play
for
keeps
himself
one
very
warm
sunday
afternoon
in
the
first
days
of
april
when
the
last
snows
were
melting
vandover
and
geary
were
in
their
room
sitting
at
opposite
ends
of
their
geary
translating
his
horace
by
the
help
of
a
bonn
translation
vandover
making
a
pen
and
ink
drawing
for
the
next
a
couple
of
young
women
passed
down
the
walk
going
across
the
yard
toward
the
square
they
were
cheaply
and
showily
dressed
one
of
them
wore
a
mannish
shirtwaist
with
a
high
collar
and
scarf
the
other
had
taken
off
her
gloves
and
was
swinging
a
bright
red
cape
in
one
of
her
bare
hands
as
the
couple
passed
they
stared
calmly
at
the
two
young
fellows
in
the
window
vandover
lowered
his
eyes
over
his
work
blushing
he
could
not
tell
why
geary
stared
back
at
them
following
them
with
his
eyes
until
they
had
gone
by
all
at
once
he
began
laughing
and
pounding
on
the
window
oh
for
goodness
sake
quit
exclaimed
vandover
in
great
alarm
twisting
off
the
and
shrinking
back
out
of
sight
into
the
room
quit
charlie
you
do
want
to
insult
a
girl
that
way
geary
looked
at
him
over
his
shoulder
in
some
surprise
and
was
about
to
answer
when
he
turned
to
the
window
again
and
exclaimed
grinning
and
waving
his
hand
oh
just
come
here
skinny
get
on
to
this
will
you
ah
come
here
and
look
you
old
chump
do
you
think
they
nice
girls
just
take
a
at
them
vandover
peered
timidly
around
geary
head
and
saw
that
the
two
girls
were
looking
back
and
laughing
and
that
the
one
with
the
red
cape
was
waving
it
at
them
at
supper
that
night
they
saw
the
girls
in
the
gallery
of
memorial
they
pointed
them
out
to
young
haight
and
geary
at
length
managed
to
attract
their
attention
after
supper
the
three
freshmen
together
with
two
of
their
sophomore
acquaintances
strolled
slowly
over
toward
the
yard
lighting
their
pipes
and
cigarettes
all
at
once
as
they
turned
into
the
lower
gate
they
came
full
upon
the
same
pair
of
girls
they
were
walking
fast
talking
and
laughing
very
loudly
track
called
out
one
of
the
sophomores
and
the
group
of
young
fellows
parted
to
let
them
pass
the
sophomore
exclaimed
in
a
tone
of
regret
do
be
in
such
a
hurry
girls
vandover
became
scarlet
and
turned
his
face
away
but
the
girls
looked
back
and
laughed
come
on
said
the
sophomore
the
group
closed
around
the
girls
and
brought
them
to
a
standstill
they
were
not
in
the
least
embarrassed
at
this
but
laughed
more
than
ever
neither
of
them
was
pretty
but
there
was
a
certain
attraction
about
them
that
pleased
vandover
immensely
he
was
very
excited
then
there
was
a
very
embarrassing
pause
no
one
knew
what
to
say
geary
alone
regained
his
assurance
at
length
and
began
a
lively
interchange
of
chaff
with
one
of
them
the
others
could
only
stand
about
and
smile
well
cried
the
other
girl
after
a
while
i
ai
going
to
stand
here
in
the
snow
all
let
take
a
walk
come
along
i
choose
before
vandover
knew
it
she
had
taken
his
arm
the
sophomore
managed
in
some
way
to
pair
off
with
the
other
girl
haight
had
already
left
the
group
the
two
couples
started
off
while
geary
and
the
other
sophomore
who
were
left
out
followed
awkwardly
in
the
rear
for
a
little
way
and
then
disappeared
vandover
was
so
excited
that
he
could
scarcely
speak
this
was
a
new
experience
at
first
it
attracted
him
but
the
hopeless
vulgarity
of
the
girl
at
his
side
her
tawdry
clothes
her
sordid
petty
talk
her
slang
her
miserable
profanity
soon
began
to
revolt
him
he
felt
that
he
could
not
keep
his
while
such
a
girl
hung
upon
his
arm
say
said
the
girl
at
length
did
i
see
you
in
town
the
other
afternoon
on
washington
street
maybe
you
did
answered
vandover
trying
to
be
polite
i
down
there
pretty
often
well
i
guess
yes
she
answered
you
harvard
sports
make
a
regular
promenade
out
o
washington
street
saturday
afternoons
i
suppose
seen
you
down
there
pretty
often
but
did
notice
do
you
stand
or
walk
vandover
gorge
rose
with
disgust
he
stopped
abruptly
and
pulled
away
from
the
girl
not
only
did
she
disgust
him
but
he
felt
sorry
for
her
he
felt
ashamed
and
pitiful
for
a
woman
who
had
fallen
so
low
still
he
tried
to
be
polite
to
her
he
did
not
know
how
to
be
rude
with
any
kind
of
woman
you
have
to
excuse
me
he
said
taking
off
his
hat
i
believe
i
can
take
a
walk
with
you
i
you
see
i
got
a
good
deal
of
work
to
do
i
think
i
have
to
leave
you
then
he
bowed
to
her
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
hurrying
away
before
she
could
answer
him
a
word
he
found
geary
alone
in
their
room
cribbing
again
ah
you
bet
geary
said
i
shook
those
chippies
i
sized
them
up
right
away
i
was
clever
enough
for
that
they
were
no
good
i
thought
you
would
get
enough
of
it
oh
i
do
know
said
vandover
after
a
while
as
he
settled
to
his
drawing
she
was
pretty
common
but
anyhow
i
do
want
to
help
bring
down
a
poor
girl
like
that
any
lower
than
she
is
already
this
saying
struck
vandover
as
being
very
good
and
noble
and
he
found
occasion
to
repeat
it
to
young
haight
the
next
day
but
within
three
days
of
this
at
the
time
when
vandover
would
have
fancied
himself
farthest
from
such
a
thing
he
underwent
a
curious
reaction
on
a
certain
evening
moved
by
an
unreasoned
instinct
he
sought
out
the
girl
who
had
just
filled
him
with
such
deep
pity
and
such
violent
disgust
and
that
night
did
not
come
back
to
the
room
in
matthew
the
thing
was
done
almost
before
he
knew
it
he
could
not
tell
why
he
had
acted
as
he
did
and
he
certainly
would
not
have
believed
himself
capable
of
it
he
passed
the
next
few
days
in
a
veritable
agony
of
repentance
overwhelmed
by
a
sense
of
shame
and
dishonour
that
were
almost
feminine
in
their
bitterness
and
intensity
he
felt
himself
lost
unworthy
and
as
if
he
could
never
again
look
a
pure
woman
in
the
eyes
unless
with
an
abominable
hypocrisy
he
was
ashamed
even
before
geary
and
young
haight
and
went
so
far
as
to
send
a
long
letter
to
his
father
acknowledging
and
deploring
what
he
had
done
asking
for
his
forgiveness
and
reiterating
his
resolve
to
shun
such
a
thing
forever
after
what
had
been
bashfulness
in
the
boy
developed
in
the
young
man
to
a
profound
respect
and
an
instinctive
regard
for
women
this
stood
him
in
good
stead
throughout
all
his
four
years
of
harvard
life
in
general
he
kept
himself
pretty
straight
there
were
plenty
of
fast
girls
and
lost
women
about
cambridge
but
vandover
found
that
he
could
not
associate
with
them
to
any
degree
of
satisfaction
he
never
knew
how
to
take
them
never
could
rid
himself
of
the
idea
that
they
were
to
be
treated
as
ladies
they
on
their
part
did
not
like
him
he
was
too
diffident
too
courteous
too
slow
they
preferred
the
rough
and
easy
confidence
of
geary
who
never
took
no
as
an
answer
and
who
could
chaff
with
them
on
their
own
ground
vandover
did
poor
work
at
harvard
and
only
graduated
as
geary
said
by
a
squeak
besides
his
regular
studies
he
took
time
to
pass
three
afternoons
a
week
in
the
studio
of
a
boston
artist
where
he
studied
anatomy
and
composition
and
drew
figures
from
the
nude
in
the
summer
vacations
he
did
not
return
home
but
accompanied
this
artist
on
sketching
tours
along
the
coast
of
maine
his
style
improved
immensely
the
moment
he
abandoned
flat
studies
and
began
to
work
directly
from
nature
he
drew
figures
well
showed
a
feeling
for
desolate
landscapes
and
even
gave
promise
of
a
good
eye
for
colour
but
he
allowed
his
fondness
for
art
to
interfere
constantly
with
his
college
work
by
the
middle
of
his
senior
year
he
was
so
loaded
with
conditions
that
it
was
only
geary
unwearied
coaching
that
pulled
him
through
at
all
as
vandover
knew
it
would
for
that
matter
vandover
returned
to
san
francisco
when
he
was
it
was
astonishing
he
had
gone
away
a
pimply
overgrown
boy
raw
and
callow
as
a
fledgling
constrained
in
society
diffident
awkward
now
he
returned
a
tall
harvardian
as
careful
as
a
woman
in
the
matter
of
dress
very
refined
in
his
manners
besides
he
was
a
delightful
conversationalist
his
father
was
rejoiced
every
one
declared
he
was
a
charming
fellow
they
were
right
vandover
was
at
his
best
at
this
time
it
was
undeniable
that
he
had
great
talent
but
he
was
so
modest
about
it
that
few
knew
how
clever
he
really
was
he
went
out
to
dinners
and
receptions
and
began
to
move
a
little
in
society
he
became
very
popular
the
men
liked
him
because
he
was
so
unaffected
so
straightforward
and
the
women
because
he
was
so
respectful
and
so
deferential
he
had
no
vices
he
had
gone
through
the
ordeal
of
college
life
and
had
come
out
without
contracting
any
habit
more
serious
than
a
vague
distaste
for
responsibility
and
an
inclination
to
shirk
disagreeable
duties
cards
he
never
thought
of
it
was
rare
that
he
drank
so
much
as
a
glass
of
beer
however
he
had
come
back
to
a
great
disappointment
business
in
san
francisco
had
entered
upon
a
long
period
of
decline
and
values
were
decreasing
for
ten
years
rents
had
been
sagging
lower
and
lower
at
the
same
time
the
interest
on
loans
and
insurances
had
increased
and
real
estate
was
brought
to
a
standstill
one
spoke
bitterly
of
a
certain
great
monopoly
that
was
ruining
both
the
city
and
state
father
had
suffered
with
the
rest
and
now
told
his
son
that
he
could
not
at
this
time
afford
to
send
him
to
paris
he
would
have
to
wait
for
better
times
at
first
this
was
a
sharp
grief
to
vandover
for
years
he
had
looked
forward
to
an
artist
life
in
the
quarter
for
a
time
he
was
inconsolable
then
at
length
readjusted
himself
to
suit
the
new
order
of
things
with
as
little
compunction
as
before
when
he
had
entered
harvard
he
found
that
he
could
be
contented
in
almost
any
environment
the
weakness
the
certain
pliability
of
his
character
easily
fitting
itself
into
new
grooves
reshaping
itself
to
suit
new
circumstances
he
prevailed
upon
his
father
to
allow
him
to
have
a
downtown
studio
in
a
little
while
he
was
perfectly
happy
again
vandover
love
for
his
art
was
keen
on
the
whole
he
kept
pretty
steadily
to
his
work
spending
a
good
six
hours
at
his
easel
every
day
very
absorbed
over
the
picture
in
hand
he
was
working
up
into
large
canvases
the
sketches
he
had
made
along
the
maine
coast
great
empty
expanses
of
sea
sky
and
full
of
wind
and
sun
they
were
really
admirable
he
even
sold
one
of
them
the
old
gentleman
was
delighted
signed
him
a
check
for
twenty
dollars
and
told
him
that
in
three
years
he
could
afford
to
send
him
abroad
in
the
meanwhile
vandover
set
himself
to
enjoy
the
new
life
little
by
little
his
set
formed
around
him
geary
and
young
haight
of
course
and
some
half
dozen
young
men
of
the
city
young
lawyers
medical
students
and
clerks
in
insurance
offices
as
vandover
thus
began
to
see
the
different
phases
of
that
life
which
lay
beyond
the
limits
of
the
college
he
perceived
more
and
more
clearly
that
he
was
an
exception
among
men
for
his
temperance
his
purity
and
his
clean
living
at
their
clubs
and
in
their
he
heard
certain
practices
which
he
had
always
believed
to
be
degrading
and
abominable
discussed
with
shouts
of
laughter
those
matters
which
until
now
he
had
regarded
with
an
almost
sacred
veneration
were
subjects
for
immense
jokes
a
few
years
ago
he
would
have
been
horrified
at
it
all
but
the
fine
quality
of
this
first
sensitiveness
had
been
blunted
since
his
experience
at
college
he
tolerated
these
things
in
his
friends
now
gradually
vandover
allowed
his
ideas
and
tastes
to
be
moulded
by
this
new
order
of
things
he
assumed
the
manners
of
these
young
men
of
the
city
very
curious
to
see
for
himself
the
other
lower
side
of
their
life
that
began
after
midnight
in
the
private
rooms
of
fast
cafés
and
that
was
continued
in
the
heavy
air
of
certain
parlours
amid
the
rustle
of
heavy
silks
slowly
the
fascination
of
this
thing
grew
upon
him
until
it
mounted
to
a
veritable
passion
his
strong
artist
imagination
began
to
be
filled
with
a
world
of
charming
sensuous
pictures
he
commenced
to
chafe
under
his
innate
respect
and
deference
for
women
to
resent
and
to
despise
it
as
the
desire
of
vice
the
blind
reckless
desire
of
the
male
grew
upon
him
he
set
himself
to
destroy
this
barrier
that
had
so
long
stood
in
his
way
he
knew
that
it
was
the
wilful
and
deliberate
corruption
of
part
of
that
which
was
best
in
him
he
was
sorry
for
it
but
persevered
nevertheless
ashamed
of
his
timidity
his
ignorance
his
boyish
purity
for
a
second
time
the
animal
in
him
the
perverse
evil
brute
awoke
and
stirred
the
idea
of
resistance
hardly
occurred
to
vandover
it
would
be
hard
it
would
be
disagreeable
to
resist
and
vandover
had
not
accustomed
himself
to
the
performance
of
hard
disagreeable
duties
they
were
among
the
unpleasant
things
that
he
shirked
he
told
himself
that
later
on
when
he
had
grown
older
and
steadier
and
had
profited
by
experience
and
knowledge
of
the
world
when
he
was
stronger
in
a
word
he
would
curb
the
thing
and
restrain
it
he
saw
no
danger
in
such
a
course
it
was
what
other
men
did
with
impunity
in
company
with
geary
and
young
haight
he
had
come
to
frequent
a
certain
one
of
the
fast
cafés
of
the
city
here
he
met
and
became
acquainted
with
a
girl
called
flossie
it
was
the
opportunity
for
which
he
was
waiting
and
he
seized
it
at
once
this
time
there
was
no
recoil
of
conscience
no
shame
no
remorse
he
even
felt
a
better
estimation
of
himself
that
that
comes
with
wider
experiences
and
with
larger
views
of
life
he
told
himself
that
all
men
should
at
one
time
see
certain
phases
of
the
world
it
rounded
out
one
life
after
all
one
had
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
those
men
only
were
perverted
who
allowed
themselves
to
be
corrupted
by
such
vice
thus
it
was
that
vandover
by
degrees
drifted
into
the
life
of
a
certain
class
of
the
young
men
of
the
city
vice
had
no
hold
on
him
the
brute
had
grown
larger
in
him
but
he
knew
that
he
had
the
creature
in
hand
he
was
its
master
and
only
on
rare
occasions
did
he
permit
himself
to
gratify
its
demands
feeding
its
abominable
hunger
from
that
part
of
him
which
he
knew
to
be
the
purest
the
cleanest
and
the
best
three
years
passed
in
this
fashion
chapter
three
vandover
had
decided
at
lunch
that
day
that
he
would
not
go
back
to
work
at
his
studio
in
the
afternoon
but
would
stay
at
home
instead
and
read
a
very
interesting
story
about
two
men
who
had
bought
a
wrecked
opium
ship
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
had
afterward
discovered
that
she
contained
only
a
few
tins
of
the
drug
he
was
curious
to
see
how
it
turned
out
the
studio
was
a
long
way
downtown
the
day
was
a
little
cold
and
he
felt
that
he
would
enjoy
a
little
relaxation
anyhow
he
meant
to
stay
at
home
and
put
in
the
whole
afternoon
on
a
good
novel
but
even
when
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
this
he
did
not
immediately
get
out
his
book
and
settle
down
to
it
after
lunch
he
loitered
about
the
house
while
his
meal
digested
feeling
very
comfortable
and
contented
he
strummed
his
banjo
a
little
and
played
over
upon
the
piano
the
three
pieces
he
had
picked
up
two
were
polkas
and
the
third
the
air
of
a
topical
song
he
always
played
the
three
together
and
in
the
same
sequence
then
he
strolled
up
to
his
room
and
brushed
his
hair
for
a
while
trying
to
make
it
lie
very
flat
and
smooth
after
this
he
went
out
to
look
at
corkle
the
terrier
and
let
him
run
a
bit
in
the
garden
then
he
felt
as
though
he
must
have
a
smoke
and
so
went
back
to
his
room
and
filled
his
pipe
when
it
was
going
well
he
took
down
his
book
and
threw
himself
into
a
deep
leather
chair
only
to
jump
up
again
to
put
on
his
all
at
once
he
became
convinced
that
he
must
have
something
to
eat
while
he
read
and
so
went
to
the
kitchen
and
got
himself
some
apples
and
a
huge
slice
of
fresh
bread
ever
since
vandover
was
a
little
boy
he
had
loved
fresh
bread
and
apples
through
the
windows
of
the
he
saw
corkle
digging
up
great
holes
in
the
geranium
beds
he
went
out
and
abused
him
and
finally
let
him
come
back
into
the
house
and
took
him
upstairs
with
him
then
at
last
he
settled
down
to
his
novel
in
the
very
comfortable
leather
chair
before
a
little
fire
for
the
last
half
of
august
is
cold
in
san
francisco
the
room
was
warm
and
snug
the
fresh
bread
and
apples
were
delicious
the
good
tobacco
in
his
pipe
purred
like
a
sleeping
kitten
and
his
novel
was
interesting
and
well
written
he
felt
calm
and
soothed
and
perfectly
content
and
took
in
the
pleasure
of
the
occasion
with
the
lazy
complacency
of
a
drowsing
cat
vandover
was
he
loved
these
sensuous
pleasures
he
loved
to
eat
good
things
he
loved
to
be
warm
he
loved
to
sleep
he
hated
to
be
bored
and
worried
he
liked
to
have
a
good
time
at
about
four
he
came
to
a
good
in
his
book
the
two
men
had
got
to
quarrelling
and
his
interest
flagged
a
little
he
pushed
corkle
off
his
lap
and
got
up
yawning
and
went
to
the
window
vandover
home
was
on
california
street
not
far
from
franklin
it
was
a
large
frame
house
of
two
stories
all
the
windows
in
the
front
were
bay
the
front
door
was
directly
in
the
middle
between
the
windows
of
the
parlour
and
those
of
the
library
while
over
the
vestibule
was
a
sort
of
balcony
that
no
one
ever
thought
of
using
the
house
was
set
in
a
large
yard
the
lawn
was
pretty
an
enormous
eucalyptus
tree
grew
at
one
corner
nearer
to
the
house
were
magnolia
and
banana
trees
growing
side
by
side
with
pines
and
firs
built
in
these
and
one
could
hear
their
curious
little
warbling
mingling
with
the
hoarse
chirp
of
the
english
sparrows
which
nested
under
the
eaves
the
back
yard
was
separated
from
the
lawn
by
a
high
fence
of
green
the
hens
and
chickens
were
kept
here
and
two
roosters
one
of
which
crowed
every
time
a
passed
the
house
on
the
door
cut
through
the
was
a
sign
look
out
for
the
dog
close
to
the
unused
barn
stood
an
immense
windmill
with
enormous
arms
when
the
wind
blew
in
the
afternoon
the
sails
whirled
about
at
a
surprising
speed
pumping
up
water
from
the
artesian
well
sunk
beneath
there
was
a
small
conservatory
where
the
orchids
were
kept
altogether
it
was
a
charming
place
however
adjoining
it
was
a
huge
vacant
lot
with
cows
in
it
it
was
full
of
dry
weeds
and
heaps
of
ashes
while
around
it
was
an
enormous
fence
painted
with
signs
of
cigars
patent
bitters
and
soap
vandover
stood
at
a
front
window
and
looked
out
on
a
rather
dreary
prospect
the
inevitable
afternoon
trades
had
been
blowing
hard
since
three
strong
and
brisk
from
the
ocean
driving
hard
through
the
golden
gate
and
filling
the
city
with
a
taint
of
salt
now
the
fog
was
coming
in
vandover
could
see
great
patches
of
it
sweeping
along
between
him
and
the
opposite
houses
all
the
eucalyptus
trees
were
dripping
and
occasionally
there
came
the
faint
moan
of
the
out
at
the
heads
he
could
see
up
the
street
for
nearly
two
miles
as
it
climbed
over
nob
hill
it
was
almost
deserted
a
now
and
then
crawled
up
and
down
its
length
and
at
times
a
delivery
wagon
rattled
across
it
but
that
was
about
all
on
the
opposite
sidewalk
two
boys
and
a
girl
were
coasting
downhill
on
their
and
their
the
cable
in
its
slot
kept
up
an
incessant
burr
and
clack
the
whole
view
was
rather
forlorn
and
vandover
turned
his
back
on
it
taking
up
his
book
again
about
five
his
father
came
home
from
his
office
hello
said
he
looking
into
the
room
are
you
home
a
little
early
ah
i
thought
you
were
going
to
bring
that
dog
into
the
house
any
more
i
wish
you
would
son
he
gets
hair
and
fleas
about
everywhere
all
right
governor
answered
vandover
i
take
him
out
come
along
cork
but
are
you
home
earlier
than
usual
persisted
his
father
as
vandover
got
up
yes
said
vandover
i
guess
i
am
a
little
after
supper
the
same
evening
when
vandover
came
downstairs
drawing
on
his
gloves
his
father
looked
over
his
paper
saying
pleasantly
well
where
are
you
going
i
going
to
see
my
girl
said
vandover
smiling
then
foreseeing
the
usual
question
he
added
i
be
home
about
eleven
i
guess
got
your
asked
the
old
gentleman
as
he
always
did
when
vandover
went
out
yep
called
back
vandover
as
he
opened
the
door
i
not
forget
it
again
governor
vandover
used
to
call
on
turner
ravis
about
twice
a
week
people
said
they
were
engaged
this
was
not
so
vandover
had
met
miss
ravis
some
two
years
before
for
a
time
the
two
had
been
sincerely
in
love
with
each
other
and
though
there
was
never
any
talk
of
marriage
between
them
they
seemed
to
have
some
sort
of
tacit
understanding
but
by
this
time
vandover
had
somehow
outgrown
the
idea
of
marrying
turner
he
still
kept
up
the
fiction
persuaded
that
turner
must
understand
the
way
things
had
come
to
be
however
he
was
still
very
fond
of
her
she
was
a
frank
girl
and
very
pretty
and
it
was
delightful
to
have
her
care
for
him
vandover
could
not
shut
his
eyes
to
the
fact
that
young
haight
was
very
seriously
in
love
with
turner
but
he
was
sure
that
turner
preferred
him
to
his
chum
she
was
too
sincere
too
frank
too
conscientious
to
practise
any
deception
on
him
there
was
quite
a
party
at
the
ravises
house
that
evening
when
vandover
arrived
young
haight
was
there
of
course
and
charlie
geary
besides
turner
herself
there
was
henrietta
vance
a
stout
pretty
girl
with
pop
eyes
and
a
little
nose
who
laughed
all
the
time
and
who
was
very
popular
these
were
all
part
of
vandover
set
they
called
each
other
by
their
first
names
and
went
everywhere
together
almost
every
saturday
evening
they
got
together
at
turner
house
and
played
whist
or
euchre
or
sometimes
even
poker
just
for
love
as
turner
said
when
vandover
came
in
they
were
all
talking
at
the
same
time
disputing
about
a
little
earthquake
that
had
occurred
the
night
before
henrietta
vance
declared
that
it
had
happened
early
in
the
morning
it
just
about
midnight
van
cried
turner
i
do
know
answered
vandover
it
did
wake
me
up
i
did
even
know
there
was
one
well
i
know
i
heard
our
clock
strike
two
just
about
half
an
hour
afterward
protested
young
haight
oh
it
was
almost
five
when
it
came
cried
henrietta
vance
well
now
you
off
said
charlie
geary
i
know
just
when
she
quaked
to
the
fraction
of
a
minute
because
it
stopped
our
hall
clock
at
just
a
little
after
three
they
were
silent
it
was
an
argument
which
was
hard
to
contradict
by
and
by
young
haight
declared
there
must
have
been
two
of
them
then
because
how
about
whist
or
euchre
or
whatever
it
is
to
be
said
charlie
geary
addressing
turner
and
interrupting
in
an
annoying
way
that
was
peculiar
to
him
ca
we
start
in
now
that
van
has
come
they
played
euchre
for
a
while
but
geary
did
not
like
the
game
and
by
and
by
suggested
poker
well
if
it
only
just
for
love
said
turner
because
you
know
mamma
does
like
it
any
other
way
at
ten
geary
said
let
quit
after
this
hand
round
what
do
you
say
the
rest
were
willing
and
so
they
all
took
account
of
their
chips
after
the
next
deal
geary
was
protesting
against
his
poor
luck
honestly
he
had
held
better
than
three
tens
more
than
twice
during
the
evening
it
was
henrietta
vance
who
took
in
everything
did
one
ever
anything
to
beat
her
luck
the
funniest
thing
they
began
to
do
tricks
with
the
cards
young
haight
showed
them
a
very
good
trick
by
which
he
could
make
the
pack
break
every
time
at
the
ace
of
clubs
vandover
exclaimed
lend
me
a
silk
hat
and
ninety
dollars
and
i
show
you
the
queerest
trick
you
ever
saw
which
sent
henrietta
vance
off
into
shrieks
of
laughter
then
geary
took
the
cards
out
of
young
haight
hands
asking
them
if
they
knew
trick
turner
said
yes
she
knew
it
but
the
others
did
not
and
geary
showed
it
to
them
it
was
interminable
henrietta
vance
chose
a
card
and
put
it
back
into
the
deck
then
the
deck
was
shuffled
and
divided
into
three
piles
after
this
geary
made
a
mental
calculation
selected
one
of
these
piles
shuffled
it
and
gave
it
back
to
her
asking
her
if
she
saw
her
card
in
it
then
more
shuffling
and
dividing
until
their
interest
and
patience
were
quite
exhausted
when
geary
finally
produced
a
jack
of
hearts
and
demanded
triumphantly
if
that
was
her
card
henrietta
began
to
laugh
and
declared
she
had
forgotten
card
she
chose
geary
said
he
would
do
the
trick
all
over
for
her
at
this
however
they
all
cried
out
and
he
had
to
give
it
up
very
irritated
at
stupidity
vexed
at
the
ill
success
of
this
first
trick
he
retired
a
little
from
their
conversation
puzzling
over
the
cards
thinking
out
new
tricks
every
now
and
then
he
came
back
among
them
going
about
from
one
to
another
holding
out
the
deck
and
exclaiming
choose
any
card
choose
any
card
after
a
while
they
all
adjourned
to
the
and
turner
and
vandover
went
out
into
the
kitchen
foraging
among
the
drawers
and
shelves
they
came
back
bringing
with
them
a
box
of
sardines
a
tin
of
three
quart
bottles
of
beer
and
what
vandover
called
sandwiches
now
do
we
want
to
go
with
these
said
turner
as
she
spread
the
lunch
on
the
table
henrietta
vance
cried
out
joyfully
at
this
and
young
haight
volunteered
to
go
out
to
get
them
get
six
turner
cried
out
after
him
henrietta
can
always
eat
two
hurry
up
and
we
wo
eat
till
you
get
back
while
he
was
gone
turner
got
out
some
glasses
for
their
beer
do
you
know
she
said
as
she
set
the
glasses
on
the
table
the
funniest
thing
happened
this
morning
to
mamma
it
was
at
breakfast
she
had
just
drunk
a
glass
of
water
and
was
holding
the
glass
in
her
hand
like
this
turner
took
one
of
the
thin
beer
glasses
in
her
hand
to
show
them
how
and
was
talking
to
pa
when
all
at
once
the
glass
broke
right
straight
around
a
ring
just
below
the
brim
you
know
and
fell
all
on
a
sudden
turner
uttered
a
shrill
exclamation
the
others
started
up
the
very
glass
she
held
in
her
hand
at
the
moment
cracked
and
broke
in
precisely
the
manner
she
was
describing
a
narrow
ring
snapped
from
the
top
dropping
on
the
floor
breaking
into
a
hundred
bits
turner
drew
in
a
long
breath
her
hand
in
the
air
still
holding
the
body
of
the
glass
that
remained
in
her
fingers
they
all
began
to
exclaim
over
the
wonder
well
did
you
ever
in
all
your
shouted
miss
vance
breaking
into
a
peal
of
laughter
geary
cried
out
cæsar
ghost
and
vandover
swore
under
his
breath
if
that
is
the
strangest
thing
i
ever
saw
cried
turner
that
funny
why
oh
i
going
try
it
with
another
but
the
second
glass
remained
intact
geary
recovered
from
his
surprise
and
tried
to
explain
how
it
could
happen
it
was
the
heat
from
your
fingers
and
the
glass
was
cold
you
know
he
said
again
and
again
but
the
strangeness
of
the
thing
still
held
them
turner
set
down
the
glass
with
the
others
and
dropped
into
a
chair
letting
her
hands
fall
in
her
lap
looking
into
their
faces
nodding
her
head
and
shutting
her
lips
ah
she
said
after
a
while
that
funny
it
kind
of
scares
one
she
was
actually
pale
oh
there
dolly
haight
cried
henrietta
vance
as
the
door
bell
rang
they
all
rushed
to
the
door
running
and
scrambling
eager
to
tell
the
news
young
haight
stood
bewildered
on
the
door
mat
in
the
vestibule
his
arms
full
of
packages
while
they
recounted
the
marvel
they
all
spoke
at
once
holding
imaginary
beer
glasses
toward
him
in
their
outstretched
hands
geary
however
refused
to
be
carried
away
by
their
excitement
and
one
heard
him
from
time
to
time
repeating
between
their
ejaculations
it
was
the
heat
from
her
fingers
you
know
and
the
glass
was
cold
young
haight
was
confused
incredulous
he
could
not
at
first
make
out
what
happened
well
just
come
and
at
the
broken
on
the
shouted
turner
decisively
dragging
him
into
the
they
waited
breathless
to
hear
what
he
would
say
he
looked
at
the
broken
glass
and
then
into
their
faces
then
he
suddenly
exclaimed
ah
you
joking
me
no
honestly
protested
vandover
that
was
just
the
way
it
happened
it
was
some
little
time
before
they
could
get
over
their
impression
of
queerness
but
by
and
by
geary
cried
out
that
the
were
getting
cold
they
settled
down
to
their
lunch
and
the
first
thing
young
haight
did
was
to
cut
his
lip
on
the
edge
of
the
broken
glass
turner
had
set
it
down
with
the
others
and
he
had
inadvertently
filled
it
for
himself
it
was
a
trifling
cut
turner
fetched
some
and
his
lip
was
patched
up
for
all
that
it
bled
quite
a
little
he
was
very
embarrassed
he
kept
his
handkerchief
to
his
mouth
and
told
them
repeatedly
to
go
on
with
their
lunch
and
not
to
mind
him
as
soon
as
they
were
eating
and
drinking
they
began
to
be
very
jolly
and
vandover
was
especially
and
entertaining
he
made
henrietta
vance
shout
with
laughter
by
pretending
that
the
olive
in
his
was
a
green
hen
egg
about
ten
young
haight
rose
from
the
table
saying
he
thought
it
was
about
time
to
say
do
be
in
a
hurry
said
turner
it
early
yet
after
that
however
they
broke
up
very
quickly
before
he
left
vandover
saw
turner
in
the
alone
for
a
minute
will

see

he
asked
as
she
held
his
overcoat
for
him

she
answered

she
replied

of

before

joined
the
others
i

he
said
as
he
went
away
the
three
young
men
went
off
down
the
street
arm
in
arm
smoking
their
cigars
and
cigarettes
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
charlie
geary
began
to
tell
the
other
two
of
everything
he
had
been
doing
since

he
was
willing
ah
he
added
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
beefsteak
i
had
this
evening
at
the
grillroom
and
as
they
rode
downtown
he
told
them
of
the
steak
in
question
i
had
a
little
mug
of
ale
with
it
too
and
a
dish
of
salad
ah
it
went
great
they
decided
after
some
discussion
that
they
would
go
to
the
imperial
chapter
four
the
imperial
was
a
resort
not
far
from
the
corner
of
sutter
and
kearney
streets
a
few
doors
below
a
certain
drug
store
in
one
window
of
which
was
a
showcase
full
of
live
snakes
the
front
of
the
imperial
was
painted
white
and
there
was
a
in
the
vestibule
of
the
main
entrance
at
the
right
of
this
main
entrance
was
another
smaller
one
a
ladies
entrance
on
the
frosted
pane
of
which
one
read
oyster
cafe
the
main
entrance
opened
directly
into
the
barroom
it
was
a
handsome
room
paved
with
marble
flags
to
the
left
was
the
bar
whose
counter
was
a
single
slab
of
polished
redwood
behind
it
was
a
huge
mirror
balanced
on
one
side
by
the
and
on
the
other
by
a
statuette
of
the
diving
girl
in
tinted
bisque
between
the
two
were
pyramids
of
glasses
and
bottles
liqueur
flasks
in
wicker
cases
and
a
great
bouquet
of
the
three
bartenders
in
clean
linen
coats
and
aprons
moved
about
here
and
there
opening
bottles
mixing
drinks
and
occasionally
turning
to
punch
the
indicator
of
the
register
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
facing
the
bar
hung
a
large
copy
of
a
french
picture
representing
a
witches
goats
and
naked
girls
whirling
through
the
air
underneath
it
was
the
lunch
counter
where
the
specialty
of
the
place
could
be
had
four
afternoons
in
the
week
elsewhere
were
machines
a
vase
of
wax
flowers
under
glass
and
a
racing
chart
setting
forth
the
odds
weights
and
entries
on
the
end
wall
over
the
was
a
second
barroom
picture
representing
the
ladies
of
a
harem
at
their
bath
but
its
private
rooms
were
the
chief
attraction
of
the
imperial
these
were
reached
by
going
in
through
the
smaller
door
to
the
right
of
the
main
vestibule
any
one
coming
in
through
this
entrance
found
himself
in
a
long
and
narrow
passage
on
the
right
of
this
passage
were
eight
private
rooms
very
small
and
open
at
the
top
as
the
law
required
down
its
length
the
passage
grew
wider
here
the
rooms
were
on
both
sides
and
were
much
larger
than
those
in
front
it
was
this
part
of
the
imperial
that
was
most
frequented
and
that
had
made
its
reputation
in
the
smaller
rooms
in
front
one
had
beer
and
welsh
rabbits
in
the
larger
rooms
champagne
and
terrapin
vandover
haight
and
geary
came
in
through
the
ladies
entrance
of
the
imperial
at
about
eleven
going
slowly
down
the
passage
looking
into
each
of
the
little
rooms
searching
for
one
that
was
empty
all
at
once
vandover
who
was
in
the
lead
cried
out
well
if
here
is
that
man
ellis
drinking
whisky

and
young
haight
hitting
him
in
the
back
while
geary
added
how
long

here
just
come
from
making
a
call
with
the
boys
had
a
fine
time
what

of
a

bancroft
ellis
was
one
of
the
young
men
of
the
city
with
whom
the
three
fellows
had
become
acquainted
just
after
their
return
from
college
for
the
most
part
they
met
him
at
downtown
restaurants
in
the
foyers
and
vestibules
of
the
theatres
on
kearney
street
of
a
saturday
afternoon
or
as
now
in
the
little
rooms
of
the
imperial
where
he
was
a
recognized
habitué
and
where
he
invariably
called
for
whisky
finishing
from
three
to
five
ponies
at
every
sitting
on
very
rare
occasions
they
saw
him
in
society
at
the
houses
where
their
set
was
received
at
these
functions
ellis
could
never
be
persuaded
to
remain
in
the
parlours
he
slipped
up
to
the
gentlemen
at
the
earliest
opportunity
and
spent
the
evening
silently
smoking
the
cigars
and
cigarettes
furnished
by
the
host
when
vandover
and
his
friends
came
up
between
dances
to
brush
their
hair
or
to
rearrange
their
neckties
they
found
him
enveloped
in
a
blue
haze
of
smoke
his
feet
on
a
chair
his
shirt
bosom
broken
and
his
waistcoat
unbuttoned
he
would
tell
them
that
he
was
bored
and
thirsty
and
ask
how
much
longer
they
were
going
to
stay
he
knew
but
few
of
their
friends
his
home
was
in
a
little
town
in
the
interior
and
he
prided
himself
on
being
a
native
son
of
the
golden
west
he
was
a
clerk
in
an
insurance
office
on
california
street
and
had
never
been
out
of
the
state
for
the
rest
he
was
a
good
enough
fellow
and
the
three
others
liked
him
very
much
he
had
a
curious
passion
for
facts
and
statistics
and
his
pockets
were
full
of
little
books
and
cards
to
which
he
was
constantly
referring
he
had
one
of
those
impossible
the
first
half
dozen
pages
loaded
with
information
of
every
kind
printed
in
blinding
type
postal
rates
to
every
country
in
the
world
statistics
as
to
population
and
rates
of
death
weights
and
measures
the
highest
mountains
in
the
world
the
greatest
depths
of
the
ocean
he
kept
a
little
book
in
his
vest
pocket
that
gave
the
plan
and
seating
capacity
of
every
theatre
in
the
city
while
in
the
pocket
was
a
tiny
webster
dictionary
which
was
his
especial
pride
the
calendar
for
the
current
year
was
pasted
in
the
lining
of
his
hat
together
with
the
means
to
be
employed
in
the
resuscitation
of
a
person
he
also
carried
about
a
vest
pocket
edition
of
popular
information
which
had
never
been
of
the
slightest
use
to
him
the
room
in
which
they
were
now
seated
was
very
small
and
opened
directly
upon
the
passage
on
either
side
of
the
table
was
a
seat
that
would
hold
two
and
on
the
wall
opposite
the
door
hung
a
mirror
its
gilt
frame
enclosed
in
pink
netting
the
table
itself
was
covered
with
a
tolerably
clean
cloth
though
it
was
of
coarse
linen
and
rather
damp
there
were
the
usual
bottles
of
olives
and
pepper
sauce
a
plate
of
broken
crackers
and
a
ribbed
of
china
the
sugar
bowl
was
of
plated
ware
and
on
it
were
scratched
numberless
dates
together
with
the
first
names
of
a
great
many
girls
nannie
ida
flossie
between
the
castor
bottles
was
the
bill
of
fare
held
by
a
thin
string
between
two
immense
leather
covers
which
were
stamped
with
wine
merchants
advertisements
geary
reached
for
this
before
any
of
the
others
saying
at
the
same
time
well
what
are
you
going
to
have
going
to
have
a
welsh
rabbit
and
a
pint
of
ale
he
looked
from
one
to
the
other
as
if
demanding
whether
or
no
they
approved
of
his
choice
he
assumed
the
management
of
what
was
going
on
advising
the
others
what
to
have
telling
vandover
not
to
order
certain
dishes
that
he
liked
because
it
took
so
long
to
cook
them
he
had
young
haight
ring
for
the
waiter
and
when
he
had
come
geary
read
off
the
entire
order
to
him
twice
over
making
sure
that
he
had
taken
it
correctly
that
what
we
want
all
right
all
right
is
it
he
said
looking
around
at
the
rest
the
waiter
whose
eyes
were
red
from
lack
of
sleep
put
down
before
them
a
plate
of
limp
soft
shrimps
hello
toby
said
vandover
good
evening
gentlemen
answered
toby
why
good
evening
vandover
have
seen
you
here
for
some
time
he
took
their
order
and
as
he
was
going
away
vandover
called
him
back
say
toby
said
he
has
flossie
been
around
no
answered
toby
she
has
shown
up
yet
her
was
in
about
nine
but
she
went
out
again
right
away
well
said
vandover
smiling
if
flossie
comes
show
her
in
here
will
you
the
others
laughed
and
joked
him
about
this
and
vandover
settled
back
in
his
seat
easing
his
position
ah
he
exclaimed
i
like
it
in
here
it
always
pleasant
and
warm
and
quiet
and
the
service
is
good
and
you
get
such
good
things
to
eat
now
that
the
young
fellows
were
by
themselves
and
could
relax
that
restraint
that
good
breeding
and
delicacy
which
had
been
natural
to
them
in
the
early
part
of
the
evening
at
the
ravises
their
manners
changed
they
lounged
clumsily
upon
their
seats
their
legs
stretched
out
their
waistcoats
unbuttoned
caring
only
to
be
at
their
ease
their
talk
and
manners
became
blunt
rude
unconstrained
the
coarser
masculine
fibre
reasserting
itself
with
the
exception
of
young
haight
they
were
all
profane
enough
and
it
was
not
very
long
before
their
conversation
became
obscene
geary
told
them
how
he
had
spent
the
afternoon
promenading
kearney
and
market
streets
and
just
where
he
had
gone
to
get
his
cocktail
and
his
cigar
ah
he
added
you
ought
to
have
seen
ida
wade
and
bessie
laguna
oh
ida
was
rigged
up
to
beat
the
band
honestly
her
was
as
broad
across
as
that
you
know
there
no
use
talking
she
an
awfully
handsome
girl
a
discussion
arose
over
the
girl
virtue
ellis
geary
and
young
haight
maintained
that
ida
was
only
fast
vandover
however
had
his
doubts
for
that
matter
said
ellis
after
a
while
i
like
bessie
laguna
a
good
deal
better
than
i
do
ida
ah
yes
retorted
young
haight
you
like
bessie
laguna
too
much
anyhow
young
haight
had
a
theory
that
one
should
never
care
in
any
way
for
that
kind
of
a
girl
nor
become
at
all
intimate
with
her
the
matter
of
liking
her
or
not
liking
her
he
said
ought
not
to
enter
into
the
question
at
all
you
are
both
of
you
out
for
a
good
time
and
that
all
you
have
a
jolly
flirtation
with
her
for
an
hour
or
two
and
you
never
see
her
again
that
the
way
it
ought
to
be
this
idea
of
getting
intimate
with
that
sort
of
a
piece
and
trying
to
get
her
to
care
for
you
is
all
wrong
oh
said
vandover
deprecatingly
you
take
all
the
pleasure
out
of
it
where
does
your
good
time
come
in
if
you
do
at
least
pretend
that
you
like
the
girl
and
try
to
make
her
like
you
but
do
you
see
answered
haight
what
a
dreadful
thing
it
would
be
if
a
girl
like
that
came
to
care
for
you
seriously
it
is
the
same
as
if
it
were
a
girl
of
your
own
class
ah
dolly
you
got
a
bean
muttered
ellis
sipping
his
whisky
meanwhile
the
imperial
had
been
filling
up
at
about
eleven
the
theatres
were
over
and
now
the
barroom
was
full
of
men
they
came
in
by
twos
and
threes
and
sometimes
even
by
noisy
parties
of
a
half
dozen
or
more
the
white
swing
doors
of
the
main
entrance
flapped
back
and
forth
continually
letting
out
into
the
street
puffs
of
tepid
air
tainted
with
the
smell
of
alcohol
the
men
entered
and
ordered
their
drinks
and
leaning
their
elbows
upon
the
bar
continued
the
conversation
they
had
begun
outside
afterward
they
passed
over
to
the
lunch
counter
and
helped
themselves
to
a
plate
of
stewed
tripe
or
potato
salad
eating
it
in
a
secluded
corner
leaning
over
so
as
not
to
stain
their
coats
there
was
a
continual
clinking
of
glasses
and
popping
of
corks
and
at
every
instant
the
clucked
and
rang
its
bell
between
the
barroom
and
the
other
part
of
the
house
was
a
door
hung
with
blue
plush
curtains
looped
back
the
waiters
constantly
passed
back
and
forth
through
this
carrying
plates
of
oysters
smoking
rarebits
tiny
glasses
of
liqueurs
and
goblets
of
cigars
all
the
private
rooms
opening
from
either
passage
were
full
the
men
came
in
walking
slowly
looking
for
their
friends
but
more
often
the
women
and
girls
passed
up
and
down
with
a
chatter
of
conversation
a
rattle
of
stiff
skirts
and
petticoats
and
a
heavy
whiff
of
musk
there
was
a
continual
going
and
coming
a
monotonous
shuffle
of
feet
and
hum
of
talk
a
heavy
odorous
warmth
in
which
were
mingled
the
smells
of
sweetened
whisky
tobacco
the
fumes
of
cooking
and
the
scent
of
perfume
exhaled
into
the
air
a
gay
and
noisy
party
developed
in
one
of
the
large
back
rooms
at
every
moment
one
could
hear
gales
of
laughter
the
rattle
of
chairs
and
glassware
mingled
with
the
sounds
of
voices
and
the
little
screams
and
cries
of
women
every
time
the
waiter
opened
the
door
to
deliver
an
order
he
let
out
a
momentary
torrent
of
noises
girls
habitués
of
the
place
continued
to
pass
the
door
of
the
room
where
vandover
and
his
friends
were
seated
each
time
a
particularly
handsome
one
went
by
the
four
looked
out
after
her
shutting
their
lips
and
eyes
and
nodding
their
heads
young
haight
had
called
for
more
drinks
ordering
however
mineral
water
for
himself
and
vandover
was
just
telling
about
posing
the
female
models
in
a
certain
to
which
he
belonged
when
he
looked
up
and
broke
off
exclaiming
well
well
here
we
are
at
last
how
are
you
flossie
come
right
in
flossie
stood
in
the
doorway
smiling
at
them
without
a
trace
of
embarrassment
or
of
confusion
in
her
manner
she
was
an
immense
girl
quite
six
feet
tall
broad
and
in
proportion
she
was
very
handsome
and
slow
in
her
movements
her
eyes
and
mouth
like
everything
about
her
were
large
but
each
time
she
spoke
or
smiled
she
disclosed
her
teeth
which
were
as
white
as
and
as
regular
as
the
rows
of
kernels
on
an
ear
of
green
corn
in
her
ears
were
small
yellow
diamonds
the
only
jewellery
she
wore
there
was
no
perceptible
cosmetic
on
her
face
which
had
a
clean
and
healthy
look
as
though
she
had
just
given
it
a
vigorous
washing
she
wore
a
black
hat
with
a
great
flare
to
the
brim
on
one
side
it
was
trimmed
very
dashingly
with
black
feathers
imitation
jet
and
a
little
puff
of
plush
blue
her
dress
was
of
rough
black
hair
and
but
for
the
immense
balloon
sleeves
absolutely
plain
it
was
cut
in
such
a
way
that
from
neck
to
waist
there
was
no
break
the
buttons
being
on
the
shoulder
and
under
the
arm
the
skirt
was
full
and
stiff
and
without
the
least
trimming
everything
was
black
hat
dress
gloves
and
the
effect
was
of
a
simplicity
and
severity
so
pronounced
as
to
be
very
striking
however
around
her
waist
she
wore
as
a
belt
a
thick
rope
of
oxidized
silver
while
her
shoes
or
rather
walking
slippers
were
of
white
canvas
she
belonged
to
that
class
of
women
who
are
not
to
know
one
last
name
or
address
and
whose
hate
and
love
are
equally
to
be
dreaded
there
was
upon
her
face
the
unmistakable
traces
of
a
ruined
virtue
and
a
vanished
innocence
her
slightest
action
suggested
her
profession
as
soon
as
she
removed
her
veil
and
gloves
it
was
as
though
she
were
partially
undressed
and
her
uncovered
face
and
hands
seemed
to
be
only
portions
of
her
nudity
the
general
conception
of
women
of
her
class
is
a
painted
and
broken
wreck
flossie
radiated
health
her
eyes
were
clear
her
nerves
steady
her
flesh
hard
and
even
as
a
child
there
hung
about
her
an
air
of
cleanliness
of
freshness
of
good
nature
of
fine
high
spirits
while
with
every
movement
she
exhaled
a
delicious
perfume
that
was
not
only
musk
but
that
seemed
to
come
alike
from
her
dress
her
hair
her
neck
her
very
flesh
and
body
vandover
was
no
longer
the
same
as
he
had
been
during
his
college
days
he
was
familiar
now
with
this
odour
of
abandoned
women
this
foul
sweet
savour
of
the
great
city
vice
that
quickened
his
breath
and
that
sent
his
heart
knocking
at
his
throat
it
was
the
sensitive
artist
nature
in
him
that
responded
instantly
to
anything
sensuously
attractive
each
kind
and
class
of
beautiful
women
could
arouse
in
vandover
passions
of
equal
force
though
of
far
different
kind
turner
ravis
influenced
him
upon
his
best
side
calling
out
in
him
all
that
was
cleanest
finest
and
most
delicate
flossie
appealed
only
to
the
animal
and
the
beast
in
him
the
evil
hideous
brute
that
made
instant
answer
what
will
you
take
flossie
asked
vandover
as
she
settled
herself
among
them
we
are
all
drinking
beer
except
ellis
he
filling
up
with
whisky
but
flossie
never
drank
it
was
one
of
the
peculiarities
for
which
she
was
well
known
i
do
want
either
she
answered
and
turning
to
the
waiter
she
added
you
can
bring
me
some
apollinaris
water
toby
flossie
betrayed
herself
as
soon
as
she
spoke
the
effect
of
her
appearance
was
spoiled
her
voice
was
hoarse
a
rasp
husky
throaty
and
full
of
brutal
vulgar
modulations
smoke
flossie
said
geary
pushing
his
cigarette
case
across
to
her
flossie
took
a
cigarette
rolled
it
to
make
it
loose
and
smoked
it
while
she
told
them
how
she
had
once
tried
to
draw
up
the
smoke
through
her
nose
as
it
came
out
between
her
lips
and
honestly
boys
she
growled
it
made
me
that
sick
that
i
just
had
to
go
to
bed
who
is
the
crowd
out
back
asked
geary
for
the
sake
of
saying
something
flossie
embarrassed
them
all
a
little
and
conversation
with
girls
of
her
class
was
difficult
oh
that
may
and
nannie
with
some
men
from
a
banquet
at
the
palace
hotel
she
answered
the
talk
dragged
along
little
by
little
and
flossie
began
badgering
young
haight

she
exclaimed
what

and
answered
very
much
embarrassed

was
anxious

got

and
reached
for
his
hat

a
smile

said
flossie
laughing
oh

he
answered
trying
to
hide
his
embarrassment
i
have
to
go
anyhow
while
the
others
were
saying
good
night
to
him
and
asking
when
they
should
see
him
again
flossie
leaned
over
to
him
crying
out
good
night
all
at
once
and
before
he
knew
what
she
was
about
she
kissed
him
full
on
the
mouth
he
started
sharply
at
this
but
was
not
angry
simply
pulling
away
from
her
blushing
very
embarrassed
and
more
and
more
anxious
to
get
away
toby
the
waiter
appeared
at
their
door
that
last
was
on
me
you

said
young
haight
intercepting
vandover
and
settling
for
the
round
of
drinks

he
added
putting
two
fingers
on
his
lips

he
went
on
wetting
the
corner
of
a
napkin
from
the
water
bottle
hold
that
on
it
the
others
began
to
laugh
flossie
did
that
vandover
explained
to
toby
ellis
was
hastily
looking
through
his
pockets
fumbling
about
among
his
little
books
i
had
something
here
he
kept
muttering
if

young
haight
moving
off
good
night
i
see

again
pretty
soon
he
went
away
ellis
who
was
still
searching
through
his
little
books
suddenly
uttered
an
exclamation
he
leaned
out
into
the
passage
crying
the
half
of
a
hot
onion
tie
it
right
on
the
cut
but
haight
had
already
gone
you

explained
ellis
that

he
added
reading
an
item
just
below
the
one
he
had
found
you
can
use
cigar
ashes
for
eczema
flossie
nodded
her
head
at
him
smiling
and
saying
well
the
next
time
i
have
eczema
i
will
remember
that
flossie
left
them
a
little
after
this
joining
nannie
and
may
in
the
larger
room
that
held
the
noisy
party
the
three
fellows
had
another
round
of
drinks
all
the
evening
ellis
had
been
drinking
whisky
now
he
astonished
the
others
by
suddenly
calling
for
beer
he
persisted
in
drinking
it
out
of
the
celery
glass
which
he
emptied
at
a
single
pull
then
vandover
had
all
round
protesting
that
his
mouth
felt
dry
as
a
geary
at
length
declared
that
he
felt
pretty
far
gone
adding
that
he
was
in
the
humour
for
having
a
high
old
time
say
boys
he
exclaimed
bringing
his
hand
down
on
the
table
what
do
you
say
that
we
all
go
to
every
joint
in
town
and
wind
up
at
the
turkish
baths
we
have
a
regular
let
see
now
how
much
money
i
have
thereat
they
all
took
account
of
their
money
vandover
had
fourteen
dollars
but
he
owed
for
materials
at
his
art
dealer
and
so
put
away
eight
of
it
in
an
inside
pocket
the
others
followed
his
example
each
one
reserving
five
dollars
for
immediate
use
that
will
be
one
dollar
for
the
hammam
said
geary
and
four
dollars
apiece
for
drinks
you
can
get
all
we
want
on
four
dollars
they
had
a
last
and
having
settled
with
toby
went
out
coming
out
into
the
cold
night
air
from
the
warm
interior
of
the
imperial
affected
vandover
and
geary
in
a
few
minutes
but
apparently
nothing
could
affect
ellis
neither
whisky
nor
beer
he
walked
steadily
between
vandover
and
geary
linking
an
arm
in
each
of
theirs
these
two
became
very
drunk
almost
at
once
at
every
minute
vandover
would
cry
out
thash
way
i
feel
jush
like
that
geary
made
a
josh
that
was
a
masterpiece
the
success
of
the
occasion
it
consisted
in
exclaiming
from
time
to
time
cherries
are
ripe
this
was
funny
it
seemed
to
have
some
ludicrous
hidden
that
was
irresistible
it
stuck
to
them
all
the
evening
when
a
girl
passed
them
on
kearney
street
and
geary
cried
out
at
her
that
cherries
were
ripe
it
threw
them
all
into
spasms
of
laughter
they
went
first
to
the
palace
garden
near
the
tivoli
theatre
where
geary
and
vandover
had
beer
and
ellis
a
whisky
cocktail
the
performance
was
just
finishing
and
they
voted
that
they
were
not
at
all
amused
at
a
lean
overworked
girl
whom
they
saw
performing
a
song
and
dance
through
a
blue
haze
of
tobacco
smoke
so
they
all
exclaimed
cherries
are
ripe
and
tramped
out
again
to
visit
the
luxembourg
the
beer
began
to
go
against
vandover
stomach
by
this
time
but
he
forced
it
down
his
throat
shutting
his
eyes
then
they
said
they
would
go
to
the
toughest
place
in
town
steve
casey
this
was
on
a
the
walls
were
covered
with
yellowed
photographs
of
pugilists
and
singers
there
was
sand
on
the
floor
and
in
the
dancing
room
at
the
back
where
nobody
danced
a
jaded
young
man
was
banging
out
polkas
and
at
a
cheap
piano
at
the
crystal
palace
where
they
all
had
they
met
one
of
ellis
friends
a
young
fellow
of
about
twenty
he
was
stone
deaf
and
in
consequence
had
become
dumb
but
for
all
that
he
was
very
eager
to
associate
with
the
young
men
of
the
city
and
would
not
hear
of
being
separated
and
set
apart
with
the
other
deaf
mutes
he
was
very
pleased
to
meet
them
and
joined
them
at
once
they
all
knew
him
pretty
well
and
called
him
the
dummy
in
the
course
of
the
evening
the
patty
was
seen
at
nearly
every
bar
and
saloon
in
the
neighbourhood
of
market
and
kearney
streets
geary
and
vandover
were
very
drunk
indeed
vandover
was
having
a
glorious
time
he
was
not
silent
a
minute
talking
laughing
and
singing
and
crying
out
continually
cherries
are
ripe
when
he
could
think
of
nothing
else
to
say
he
would
exclaim
thash
way
i
feel
for
two
hours
they
drank
steadily
vandover
was
in
a
dreadful
condition
the
dummy
got
so
drunk
that
he
could
talk
a
peculiarity
which
at
times
had
been
known
to
occur
to
him
as
will
sometimes
happen
geary
sobered
up
a
little
and
at
the
grotto
bathed
his
head
and
face
in
the
washroom
after
this
he
became
pretty
steady
he
stopped
drinking
and
tried
to
assume
the
management
of
the
party
ordering
their
drinks
for
them
and
casting
up
the
amount
of
the
check
about
two
they
returned
toward
the
luxembourg
staggering
and
swaying
the
luxembourg
was
a
sort
of
german
restaurant
under
a
theatre
where
one
could
get
some
very
good
german
dishes
there
vandover
had
beer
and
sauerkraut
but
ellis
took
more
whisky
the
dummy
continued
to
make
peculiar
sounds
in
his
throat
and
geary
gravely
informed
the
waiter
that
cherries
were
ripe
all
at
once
ellis
was
drunk
collapsing
in
a
moment
the
skin
around
his
eyes
was
purple
and
swollen
the
pupils
themselves
were
contracted
and
their
range
of
vision
seemed
to
stop
at
about
a
yard
in
front
of
his
face
suddenly
he
swept
glasses
plates
castor
knives
forks
and
all
from
off
the
table
with
a
single
movement
of
his
arm
they
all
jumped
up
sober
in
a
minute
knowing
that
a
scene
was
at
hand
the
waiter
rushed
at
ellis
but
ellis
knocked
him
down
and
tried
to
stamp
on
his
face
vandover
and
the
dummy
tried
to
hold
his
arms
and
pull
him
off
he
turned
on
the
dummy
in
a
silent
frenzy
of
rage
and
brought
his
knuckles
down
upon
his
head
again
and
again
for
the
moment
ellis
could
neither
hear
nor
see
nor
speak
he
was
blind
dumb
fighting
drunk
and
his
fighting
was
not
the
fighting
of
vandover
get
in
here
and
help
will
you
panted
vandover
to
geary
as
he
struggled
with
ellis
he
can
kill
people
when
he
like
this
oh
damn
the
whisky
anyhow
look
out
do
let
him
get
that
knife
grab
his
other
arm
there
now
kick
his
feet
from
under
him
oh
kick
hard
sit
on
his
legs
there
now
ah
hell
he
bitten
me
look
out
here
comes
the
bouncer
the
bouncer
and
three
other
waiters
charged
into
them
while
they
were
struggling
on
the
floor
vandover
was
twice
knocked
down
and
the
dummy
had
his
lip
split
ellis
struggled
to
his
feet
again
and
still
silent
fought
them
all
alike
a
fine
line
of
froth
gathering
at
the
corners
of
his
lips
when
they
were
finally
ejected
and
pulled
themselves
together
in
the
street
outside
geary
had
disappeared
he
had
left
them
during
the
struggle
with
ellis
and
had
gone
home
ah
you
bet
he
was
going
to
stay
any
longer
with
the
crowd
when
they
got
like
that
if
ellis
was
fool
enough
to
get
as
drunk
as
that
it
was
his
own
lookout
going
to
stay
and
get
thrown
out
of
any
saloon
ah
no
you
bet
he
was
too
clever
for
that
he
was
sober
enough
now
and
would
go
home
to
bed
and
get
a
good
sleep
the
fight
in
the
saloon
had
completely
sobered
the
rest
of
them
ellis
was
tractable
enough
again
and
very
sorry
for
having
got
them
into
such
a
row
vandover
was
horribly
sick
at
his
stomach
the
three
locked
arms
and
started
slowly
toward
the
turkish
baths
on
their
way
they
stopped
at
an
drug
store
and
had
some
seltzer
vandover
had
about
three
hours
sleep
that
night
he
was
awakened
by
the
attendant
shaking
his
arm
and
crying
six
sir
huh
he
exclaimed
starting
up
what
about
six
i
want
to
get
up
told
me
to
call
you
sir
at
six
quarter
to
seven
now
oh
all
right
very
well
answered
vandover
he
turned
away
his
face
on
the
pillow
while
a
wretched
feeling
of
nausea
crept
over
him
every
movement
of
his
head
made
it
ache
to
bursting
behind
his
temples
the
blood
throbbed
and
pumped
like
the
knocking
of
hammers
his
mouth
would
have
been
dry
but
for
a
thick
slime
that
filled
it
and
that
tasted
of
oil
he
felt
weak
his
hands
trembled
his
forehead
was
cold
and
seemed
wet
and
sticky
he
could
recall
hardly
anything
of
the
previous
night
he
remembered
however
of
going
to
the
imperial
and
of
seeing
flossie
and
he
remember
at
last
of
leaving
word
to
be
called
at
six
he
got
up
without
waking
the
other
two
fellows
and
took
a
plunge
in
the
cold
tank
dressed
very
slowly
and
went
out
the
stores
were
all
closed
the
streets
were
almost
deserted
he
walked
to
the
nearest
uptown
and
took
an
outside
seat
feeling
better
and
steadier
for
every
moment
of
the
sharp
morning
air
van
ness
avenue
was
very
still
it
was
about
seven
the
curtains
were
down
in
all
the
houses
here
and
there
a
servant
could
be
seen
washing
down
the
front
steps
in
the
vestibules
of
some
of
the
smaller
houses
were
loaves
of
french
bread
and
glass
jars
of
cream
while
near
them
lay
the
damp
twisted
roll
of
the
morning
paper
there
was
everywhere
a
great
chittering
of
sparrows
and
the
as
yet
empty
trundled
down
the
cross
streets
the
conductors
cleaning
the
windows
and
metal
work
from
far
down
at
one
end
of
the
avenue
came
the
bells
of
the
catholic
cathedral
ringing
for
early
mass
and
a
second
girl
hurried
past
him
carrying
her
at
the
other
end
of
the
avenue
was
a
blue
vista
of
the
bay
the
great
bulk
of
mount
tamalpais
rearing
itself
out
of
the
water
like
a
waking
lion
in
front
of
the
little
church
turner
was
waiting
for
him
she
was
dressed
very
prettily
and
the
cold
morning
air
had
given
her
a
fine
colour
you
do
look
more
than
half
awake
she
said
as
vandover
came
up
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
to
come
oh
van
you
look
dreadfully
it
is
too
bad
to
make
you
get
up
so
early
no
no
protested
vandover
i
was
only
too
glad
to
come
i
sleep
well
last
night
i
hope
i
have
kept
you
waiting
i
only
just
come
answered
turner
but
i
think
it
is
time
to
go
in
the
little
organ
was
muttering
softly
to
itself
as
they
entered
it
was
very
still
otherwise
the
morning
sun
struck
through
the
stained
windows
and
made
pretty
lights
about
the
altar
besides
themselves
there
were
some
half
dozen
other
worshippers
the
little
organ
ceased
with
a
long
droning
sigh
and
the
minister
in
his
white
robes
turned
about
facing
his
auditors
and
in
the
midst
of
a
great
silence
opened
the
communion
service
with
the
words
ye
who
do
truly
and
earnestly
repent
you
of
your
sins
and
are
in
love
and
charity
with
your
neighbours
as
vandover
rose
with
the
rest
the
blood
rushed
to
his
head
and
a
feeling
of
nausea
and
exhaustion
the
dregs
of
his
previous
debauch
came
over
him
again
for
a
moment
so
that
he
took
hold
of
the
back
of
the
pew
in
front
of
him
to
steady
himself
chapter
five
in
the
afternoons
vandover
worked
in
his
studio
which
was
on
sacramento
street
but
in
the
mornings
he
was
accustomed
to
study
in
the
at
the
school
of
design
this
was
on
california
street
over
the
market
an
immense
room
partitioned
by
enormous
wooden
screens
into
alcoves
where
the
classes
worked
painting
carrots
grapes
and
dusty
brown
all
about
were
a
multitude
of
casts
the
fighting
gladiator
the
discobulus
the
venus
of
milo
and
hundreds
of
smaller
pieces
masks
torsos
and
the
heads
of
the
parthenon
horses
flattened
and
broken
bits
of
charcoal
littered
the
floor
and
cluttered
the
chairs
and
shelves
a
strong
odour
of
turpentine
and
fixative
was
in
the
air
mingled
with
the
stronger
odours
of
linseed
oil
and
sour
stale
french
bread
every
afternoon
a
portrait
class
of
some
assembled
in
one
of
the
larger
alcoves
near
the
door
several
of
the
street
characters
of
the
city
had
posed
for
this
class
and
at
one
time
father
elphick
the
vegetarian
with
his
crooked
stick
and
white
clothes
had
sat
to
it
for
his
head
vandover
was
probably
the
most
promising
member
of
the
school
his
style
was
sketchy
conscientious
and
full
of
strength
and
decision
he
worked
in
large
lines
broad
surfaces
and
masses
of
light
or
shade
his
colour
was
good
running
to
purples
reds
and
admirable
greens
full
of
bitumen
and
raw
sienna
though
he
had
no
idea
of
composition
he
was
clever
enough
to
acknowledge
it
his
finished
pictures
were
broad
reaches
of
landscape
deserts
shores
and
moors
in
which
he
placed
solitary
figures
of
men
or
animals
in
a
way
that
was
very
effective
as
for
instance
a
great
strip
of
shore
and
in
the
foreground
the
body
of
a
drowned
sailor
a
lion
drinking
in
the
midst
of
an
immense
sahara
or
one
that
he
called
the
remnant
of
an
army
a
dying
war
horse
wandering
on
an
empty
plain
the
saddle
turned
under
his
belly
his
mane
and
tail
snarled
with
burrs
some
time
before
there
had
come
to
him
the
idea
for
a
great
picture
it
was
to
be
his
first
masterpiece
his
salon
picture
when
he
should
get
to
paris
a
british
cavalryman
and
his
horse
both
dying
of
thirst
and
wounds
were
to
be
lost
on
a
soudanese
desert
and
in
the
middle
distance
on
a
ridge
of
sand
a
lion
should
be
drawing
in
upon
them
crouched
on
his
belly
his
tail
stiff
his
lower
jaw
hanging
the
melodrama
of
the
old
english
home
book
of
art
still
influenced
vandover
he
was
in
love
with
this
idea
for
a
picture
and
had
determined
to
call
it
the
last
enemy
the
effects
he
wished
to
produce
were
isolation
and
intense
heat
as
to
the
soldier
he
was
as
yet
undecided
whether
to
represent
him
facing
death
resignedly
calmly
or
grasping
the
barrel
of
his
useless
rifle
determined
to
fight
to
the
last
vandover
loved
to
paint
and
to
draw
he
was
perfectly
contented
when
his
picture
was
coming
right
and
when
he
felt
sure
he
was
doing
good
work
he
often
did
better
than
he
thought
he
would
but
never
so
well
as
he
thought
he
however
it
bored
him
to
work
very
hard
and
when
he
did
not
enjoy
his
work
he
stopped
it
at
once
he
would
tell
himself
on
these
occasions
that
one
had
to
be
in
the
mood
and
that
he
should
wait
for
the
inspiration
although
he
knew
very
well
how
absurd
such
excuses
were
how
false
and
how
pernicious
that
certain
little
weakness
of
vandover
character
his
brought
him
to
such
a
point
that
he
thought
he
had
to
be
amused
if
his
painting
amused
him
very
good
if
not
he
found
something
else
that
would
on
the
following
monday
as
he
worked
in
the
vandover
was
thinking
or
rather
trying
not
to
think
of
what
he
had
done
the
sunday
morning
previous
when
he
had
gone
to
communion
with
turner
ravis
for
a
long
time
he
evaded
the
thought
because
he
knew
that
if
he
allowed
it
to
come
into
his
mind
it
would
worry
and
harass
him
but
by
and
by
the
effort
of
dodging
the
enemy
became
itself
too
disagreeable
so
he
gave
it
up
and
allowed
himself
to
look
the
matter
squarely
in
the
face
ah
yes
it
was
an
ugly
thing
he
had
done
there
a
really
awful
thing
he
must
have
been
still
drunk
when
he
had
knelt
in
the
chancel
vandover
shuddered
as
he
thought
of
this
and
told
himself
that
one
could
hardly
commit
a
worse
sacrilege
and
that
some
time
he
would
surely
be
called
to
account
for
it
but
here
he
checked
himself
suddenly
not
daring
to
go
further
one
would
have
no
peace
of
mind
left
if
one
went
on
brooding
over
such
things
in
this
fashion
he
realized
the
enormity
of
what
he
had
done
he
had
tried
to
be
sorry
for
it
it
was
perhaps
the
worst
thing
he
had
ever
done
but
now
he
had
reached
the
lowest
point
he
would
take
care
never
to
do
such
a
thing
again
after
this
he
would
be
better
but
this
was
not
so
unconsciously
vandover
had
shut
a
door
behind
him
he
would
never
again
be
exactly
the
same
and
the
keeping
of
his
appointment
with
turner
ravis
that
sunday
morning
was
as
it
were
a
long
step
onward
in
his
progress
of
ruin
and
pollution
he
shook
himself
as
though
relieving
his
shoulders
of
a
weight
the
model
in
the
had
just
been
posed
for
the
week
and
the
others
had
begun
work
the
model
for
that
week
was
a
woman
a
fact
that
pleased
vandover
for
he
drew
these
nude
women
better
than
any
one
in
the
school
perhaps
better
than
any
one
in
the
city
portrait
work
and
the
power
to
catch
subtle
intellectual
distinctions
in
a
face
were
sometimes
beyond
him
but
his
feeling
for
the
flesh
and
for
the
movement
and
character
of
a
pose
was
admirable
he
set
himself
to
work
holding
his
stick
of
charcoal
toward
the
model
at
he
measured
off
the
heads
five
in
all
and
laid
off
an
equal
number
of
spaces
upon
his
paper
after
this
by
aid
of
his
mirror
he
studied
the
general
character
of
the
pose
for
nearly
half
an
hour
then
with
a
few
strokes
of
his
charcoal
he
laid
off
his
larger
construction
lines
with
a
freedom
and
a
precision
that
were
excellent
upon
these
lines
he
made
a
second
drawing
a
little
more
detailed
though
as
yet
everything
was
blocked
in
angularly
and
roughly
then
putting
a
thin
flat
edge
upon
his
charcoal
he
started
the
careful
and
finished
outline
by
the
end
of
an
hour
the
first
sketch
of
his
drawing
was
complete
it
was
astonishingly
good
vigorous
and
solid
better
than
all
it
had
that
feeling
for
form
that
makes
just
the
difference
between
the
amateur
and
the
genuine
artist
by
this
time
vandover
interest
began
to
flag
four
times
he
had
drawn
and
redrawn
the
articulation
of
the
model
left
shoulder
as
she
stood
turned
sideways
to
him
one
hand
on
her
hip
the
deltoid
muscle
was
at
once
contracted
and
foreshortened
it
was
a
difficult
bit
of
anatomy
to
draw
vandover
was
annoyed
at
his
ill
success
such
close
attention
and
continued
effort
wearied
him
a
little
the
room
was
overheated
and
close
and
the
gas
stove
which
was
placed
near
the
throne
to
warm
the
model
leaked
and
filled
the
room
with
a
nasty
brassy
smell
vandover
remembered
that
the
previous
week
he
had
been
looking
over
some
old
bound
copies
of
in
the
mechanics
library
and
had
found
them
of
absorbing
interest
there
was
a
pleasant
corner
and
a
huge
comfortable
chair
near
where
they
were
in
the
and
from
the
window
one
could
occasionally
look
out
upon
the
street
it
was
a
quiet
spot
and
he
would
not
be
disturbed
all
the
morning
the
idea
was
so
attractive
that
he
put
away
his
portfolio
and
drawing
things
and
went
out
for
an
hour
he
gave
himself
up
to
the
enjoyment
of
excusing
his
indolence
by
telling
himself
that
it
was
all
in
his
profession
and
was
not
time
lost
a
reproduction
of
a
picture
by
gérome
gave
him
some
suggestions
for
the
last
enemy
which
he
noted
very
carefully
he
was
interrupted
by
a
rustle
of
starched
skirts
and
a
voice
that
said
why
hello
van
he
looked
up
quickly
to
see
a
young
girl
of
about
twenty
dressed
in
a
black
bolero
jacket
of
imitation
astrakhan
with
big
sleeves
a
striped
silk
skirt
and
a
very
broad
hat
tilted
to
one
side
her
hair
was
very
blond
though
coarse
and
dry
from
being
bleached
and
a
little
flat
curl
of
it
lay
very
low
on
her
forehead
she
was
marvellously
pretty
vandover
was
delighted
why
he
exclaimed
holding
her
hand
awfully
nice
to
see
you
here
wo
you
sit
down
and
he
pushed
his
chair
toward
her
but
ida
wade
said
no
she
had
just
come
in
after
a
new
book
and
of
course
it
had
to
be
out
but
where
had
he
kept
himself
so
long
that
was
the
way
he
threw
off
on
her
ah
yes
he
was
going
with
miss
ravis
now
and
would
look
at
any
one
else
vandover
protested
against
this
and
ida
wade
went
on
to
ask
him
why
he
could
come
up
to
call
on
her
that
very
night
adding
we
might
go
to
the
tivoli
or
somewhere
all
at
once
she
interrupted
herself
laughing
oh
i
heard
all
about
you
the
other
night
are
you
and
the
boys
painted
the
town
red
you
ah
van
i
right
on
to
she
would
not
tell
him
how
she
heard
but
took
herself
off
laughing
and
reminding
him
to
come
up
early
ida
wade
belonged
to
a
certain
type
of
young
girl
that
was
very
common
in
the
city
she
was
what
men
among
each
other
called
gay
though
that
was
the
worst
that
could
be
said
of
her
she
was
virtuous
but
the
very
fact
that
it
was
necessary
to
say
so
was
enough
to
cause
the
statement
to
be
doubted
when
she
was
younger
and
had
been
a
pupil
at
the
girls
high
school
she
had
known
and
had
even
been
the
companion
of
such
girls
as
turner
ravis
and
henrietta
vance
but
since
that
time
girls
of
that
class
had
ignored
her
now
almost
all
of
her
acquaintances
were
men
and
to
half
of
these
she
had
never
been
introduced
they
had
managed
to
get
acquainted
with
her
on
kearney
street
at
theatres
at
the
mechanics
fair
and
at
baseball
games
she
loved
to
have
a
gay
time
which
for
her
meant
to
drink
california
champagne
to
smoke
cigarettes
and
to
kick
at
the
chandelier
she
was
still
virtuous
and
meant
to
stay
so
there
was
nothing
vicious
about
her
and
she
was
as
far
removed
from
flossie
class
as
from
that
of
turner
ravis
she
was
very
clever
half
of
her
acquaintances
even
the
men
did
not
know
how
very
gay
she
was
only
those
like
vandover
who
knew
her
best
knew
her
for
what
she
was
for
ida
was
morbidly
careful
of
appearances
and
as
jealous
of
her
reputation
as
only
fast
girls
are
bessie
laguna
was
her
counterpart
bessie
was
the
girl
she
went
with
just
as
henrietta
vance
was
turner
chum
and
nannie
was
ida
lived
with
her
people
on
golden
gate
avenue
not
far
from
larkin
street
her
father
had
a
interest
in
a
establishment
on
howard
street
and
her
mother
gave
lessons
in
painting
on
china
and
on
velvet
ida
had
just
been
graduated
from
the
normal
school
and
often
substituted
at
various
kindergartens
in
the
city
she
hoped
soon
to
get
a
permanent
place
vandover
arrived
at
ida
house
that
night
at
about
eight
in
the
midst
of
a
drenching
fog
the
parlour
and
front
room
on
the
second
floor
were
furnished
with
bay
windows
decorated
with
some
meaningless
sort
of
millwork
the
front
door
stood
at
the
right
of
the
parlour
windows
two
corinthian
pillars
on
either
side
of
the
vestibule
supported
a
balcony
these
pillars
had
iron
capitals
which
were
painted
to
imitate
the
wood
of
the
house
which
in
its
turn
was
painted
to
imitate
stone
the
house
was
but
two
stories
high
and
the
roof
was
topped
with
an
iron
cresting
there
was
a
microscopical
front
yard
in
which
one
saw
a
tiny
gravel
walk
two
steps
long
that
led
to
a
door
under
the
front
steps
where
the
was
kept
a
few
dusty
and
straggling
grew
about
ida
opened
the
door
for
vandover
almost
as
soon
as
he
rang
and
pulled
him
into
the
entry
exclaiming
come
in
out
of
the
wet
as
the
whale
said
to
jonah
it
a
nasty
night
vandover
noticed
as
he
came
in
that
the
house
smelt
of
upholstery
cooking
and
turpentine
he
did
not
take
off
his
overcoat
but
went
with
her
into
the
parlour
the
parlour
was
a
little
room
with
tinted
plaster
walls
shut
off
from
the
by
sliding
doors
a
ply
carpet
covered
the
floor
a
cheap
piano
stood
across
one
corner
of
the
room
and
a
greenish
sofa
across
another
the
mantelpiece
was
of
white
marble
with
gray
spots
on
one
side
of
it
stood
an
alaskan
grass
basket
full
of
photographs
and
on
the
other
an
inverted
section
of
a
painted
with
daisies
and
full
of
gilded
tied
with
a
blue
ribbon
near
the
piano
straddled
a
huge
easel
of
imitation
brass
the
crayon
picture
of
ida
baby
sister
enlarged
from
a
photograph
across
one
corner
of
this
picture
was
a
yellow
drape
there
were
a
great
many
of
these
drapes
all
about
the
room
hanging
over
the
corners
of
the
chairs
upon
an
edge
of
the
mantelpiece
and
even
twisted
about
the
chandelier
in
the
exact
middle
of
the
mantelpiece
itself
was
the
clock
one
of
the
chief
ornaments
of
the
room
almost
the
first
thing
one
saw
upon
entering
it
was
a
timepiece
perversely
set
in
one
corner
of
an
immense
red
plush
palette
the
palette
itself
was
tilted
to
one
side
and
was
upheld
by
an
easel
of
twisted
brass
wire
out
of
the
stuck
half
a
dozen
brushes
wired
together
in
a
round
bunch
and
covered
with
gilt
paint
the
clock
never
was
wound
it
went
so
fast
that
it
was
useless
as
a
timepiece
over
it
however
hung
a
large
and
striking
picture
a
species
of
cheap
photogravure
a
lion
lying
in
his
cage
looking
mildly
at
the
spectator
over
his
shoulder
in
front
of
the
picture
were
real
iron
bars
with
real
straw
tucked
in
behind
them
ida
sat
down
on
the
piano
stool
twisting
back
and
forth
leaning
her
elbows
on
the
keys
all
the
folks
have
gone
out
to
a
and
i
left
all
alone
in
the
house
with
maggie
she
said
then
she
added
bessie
and
bandy
ellis
said
they
would
come
down
and
i
thought
we
could
all
go
downtown
to
the
tivoli
or
somewhere
in
the
boxes
you
know
way
up
at
the
top
hardly
had
she
spoken
the
words
when
bessie
and
ellis
arrived
ida
went
upstairs
to
get
on
her
hat
at
once
because
it
was
so
late
and
bessie
went
with
her
ellis
and
vandover
laughed
as
soon
as
they
saw
each
other
and
ellis
exclaimed
mockingly
thash
jush
way
i
feel
vandover
grinned
that
so
he
answered
i
remember
now
of
having
made
that
remark
several
times
but
oh
you
were
fearful
do
you
remember
the
row
in
the
luxembourg
look
there
where
you
bit
me
ellis
was
incensed
with
geary
because
he
had
forsaken
their
party
oh
that
charlie
geary
all
over
answered
vandover
as
they
were
speaking
there
came
a
sudden
outburst
of
bells
in
various
parts
of
the
city
and
simultaneously
they
heard
the
hoarse
croaking
of
a
whistle
down
by
the
waterfront
fire
said
vandover
indifferently
ellis
was
already
fumbling
in
his
pockets
keeping
count
of
the
strokes
that
one
he
exclaimed
pulling
out
and
studying
his
list
of
and
that
three
and
one
let
see
now
that
bush
and
hyde
streets
not
very
far
off
and
he
returned
his
card
to
the
inside
pocket
of
his
coat
as
though
he
had
accomplished
a
duty
he
lit
a
cigar
i
wonder
now
he
said
hesitating
i
guess
i
better
not
smoke
in
here
i
go
outside
and
get
a
mouthful
of
smoke
before
the
girls
come
down
he
went
out
and
vandover
sat
down
to
the
cheap
piano
and
played
his
three
inevitable
pieces
the
two
polkas
and
the
air
of
the
topical
song
but
he
was
interrupted
by
ellis
who
opened
the
door
crying
out
oh
come
out
here
and
see
the
will
you
devil
of
a
blaze
vandover
ran
out
and
saw
a
great
haze
of
red
through
the
fog
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
oh
say
girls
he
shouted
jumping
back
to
the
foot
of
the
stairs
ida
bessie
there
a
fire
just
look
out
of
your
windows
hark
there
go
the
engines
bessie
came
tearing
down
the
stairs
and
out
on
the
front
steps
where
the
two
fellows
were
standing
hatless
where
oh

exclaimed
vandover

awful
big
fire
right
near

and

her

full
of
pins

down
in
just

minute

vandover
it
will
be
all

by
the
time

i

to
help
no

she
screamed
do

rattle
me
i
all
mixed
up
oh

i
ca
find
my
czarina
but
at
last
she
came
running
down
breathless
shrugging
herself
into
her
bolero
jacket
they
all
hurried
into
the
street
and
turned
in
the
direction
of
the
blaze
other
people
were
walking
rapidly
in
the
same
direction
and
there
was
an
opening
and
shutting
of
windows
and
front
doors
a
steamer
thundered
past
clanging
and
smoking
followed
by
a
score
of
boys
it
took
them
longer
to
reach
the
fire
than
they
expected
and
by
the
time
they
had
come
within
two
blocks
of
it
they
were
quite
out
of
breath
here
the
excitement
was
lively
the
sidewalks
were
full
of
people
going
in
the
same
direction
on
all
sides
there
were
guesses
as
to
where
the
fire
was
on
the
front
steps
of
many
houses
stood
gentlemen
still
holding
their
evening
papers
and
cigars
very
amused
and
interested
in
watching
the
crowd
go
past
one
heard
them
from
time
to
time
calling
to
their
little
sons
who
were
dancing
on
the
sidewalks
forbidding
them
to
go
in
the
open
windows
above
could
be
seen
the
other
members
of
the
family
their
faces
faintly
tinged
with
the
glow
looking
and
pointing
or
calling
across
the
street
to
their
friends
in
the
opposite
houses
every
one
was
in
good
humour
it
was
an
event
a
fête
for
the
entire
neighbourhood
vandover
and
his
party
came
at
last
to
the
first
engines
violently
pumping
and
coughing
the
huge
gray
horses
standing
near
by
already
unhitched
and
blanketed
indifferently
feeding
in
their
nosebags
some
of
the
crowd
preferred
to
watch
the
engines
rather
than
the
fire
and
there
were
even
some
who
were
coming
away
from
it
exclaiming
false
alarm
or
all
out
now
the
party
had
come
up
quite
close
they
could
smell
the
burning
wood
and
could
see
the
roofs
of
the
nearer
houses
beginning
to
stand
out
sharp
and
black
against
the
red
glow
beyond
it
was
a
barn
behind
a
huge
frame
house
that
was
afire
the
dry
hay
burning
like
powder
and
by
the
time
they
reached
it
the
flames
were
already
dwindling
the
hose
was
lying
like
a
python
all
about
the
streets
while
upon
the
neighbouring
roofs
were
groups
of
firemen
with
helmets
and
axes
some
were
shouting
into
the
street
below
and
others
were
holding
the
spouting
nozzles
of
the
hose
ah
exclaimed
an
old
man
standing
near
to
ida
and
vandover
ah
was
here
when
it
first
broke
out
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
flames
then
look
there
a
tree
catching
the
crowd
became
denser
policemen
pushed
it
back
and
stretched
a
rope
across
the
street
there
was
a
world
of
tumbling
yellow
smoke
that
made
one
eyes
smart
and
a
great
crackling
and
snapping
of
flames
terribly
excited
little
boys
were
about
everywhere
whistling
and
calling
for
each
other
as
the
crowd
separated
them
they
watched
the
fire
for
some
time
standing
on
a
pile
of
boards
in
front
of
a
house
but
as
it
dwindled
they
wearied
of
it
want
to
go
asked
vandover
at
last
yes
answered
ida
we
might
as
well
oh
where
bessie
and
ellis
they
were
nowhere
to
be
seen
vandover
whistled
and
ida
even
called
but
in
vain
the
little
boys
in
the
crowd
mimicked
ida
crying
back
hey
bessie
oh
mommer
wants
you
the
men
who
stood
near
laughed
at
this
but
it
annoyed
vandover
much
more
than
it
did
ida
ah
well
never
mind
she
said
at
length
let
them
go
now
shall
go
it
was
too
late
for
the
theatre
but
to
return
home
was
out
of
the
question
they
started
off
aimlessly
downtown
while
he
talked
vandover
was
perplexed
ida
was
gayly
dressed
and
was
one
of
those
girls
who
can
not
open
their
mouths
nor
raise
a
finger
in
the
street
without
attracting
attention
vandover
was
not
at
all
certain
that
he
cared
to
be
seen
on
kearney
street
as
ida
wade
escort
one
never
knew
who
one
was
going
to
meet
ida
was
not
a
bad
girl
she
was
not
notorious
but
confound
it
it
would
look
queer
and
at
the
same
time
while
ida
was
the
kind
of
girl
that
one
did
not
want
to
be
seen
with
she
was
not
the
kind
of
girl
that
could
be
told
so
in
an
upper
box
at
the
tivoli
it
would
have
been
different
one
could
keep
in
the
background
but
to
appear
on
kearney
street
with
a
girl
who
wore
a
hat
like
that
and
who
would
not
put
on
her
gloves
ah
no
it
was
out
of
the
question
ida
was
talking
away
endlessly
about
a
kindergarten
in
which
she
had
substituted
the
last
week
she
told
him
about
the
funny
little
nigger
girl
and
about
the
games
and
songs
and
how
they
played
birds
and
hopped
around
and
cried
twit
twit
and
the
game
of
the
butterflies
visiting
the
flowers
she
even
sang
part
of
a
song
about
the
waves
every
little
wave
had
its
on
its
on
it
more
than
enough
she
said
say
ida
interrupted
vandover
at
length
i
pretty
hungry
ca
we
go
somewhere
and
eat
something
i
like
a
welsh
rabbit
all
right
she
answered
where
do
you
want
to
go
well
replied
vandover
running
over
in
his
mind
the
places
he
might
reach
by
unfrequented
streets
there
marchand
or
tortoni
or
the
poodle
dog
suits
she
answered
any
one
you
like
say
van
she
added
were
you
boys
at
the
imperial
the
other
night
what
kind
of
a
place
is
that
on
the
instant
vandover
wondered
what
she
could
mean
was
it
possible
that
ida
would
go
to
a
place
like
that
with
him
the
imperial
he
answered
oh
i
do
know
the
imperial
is
a
sort
of
a
nice
place
it
has
private
rooms
like
all
of
these
places
the
cooking
is
simply
out
of
sight
i
think
there
is
a
bar
connected
with
it
then
he
went
on
to
talk
indifferently
about
the
kindergarten
though
his
pulse
was
beating
fast
and
his
nerves
were
strung
taut
by
and
by
ida
said
i
did
know
there
was
a
bar
at
the
imperial
i
thought
it
was
just
some
kind
of
an
oyster
joint
why
i
heard
of
a
very
nice
girl
a
swell
girl
going
in
there
oh
yes
said
vandover
they
do
i
say
ida
he
went
on
what
the
matter
with
going
down
the
exclaimed
ida
well
i
guess
why
it
all
right
if
i
with
you
retorted
vandover
but
if
you
do
like
it
we
can
go
anywhere
else
well
i
guess
we
go
anywhere
else
returned
ida
and
for
the
time
the
subject
was
dropped
they
took
a
sutter
street
car
and
got
off
at
grant
avenue
having
decided
to
go
to
marchand
that
the
imperial
down
there
is
it
asked
ida
as
they
reached
the
sidewalk
vandover
made
a
last
attempt
i
say
ida
come
on
let
go
there
it
all
right
if
i
with
you
ah
come
along
what
the
odds
no
she
answered
decisively
what
kind
of
a
girl
do
you
think
i
am
anyway
well
i
tell
you
what
answered
vandover
just
come
down
the
place
and
if
you
do
like
the
looks
of
it
you
need
go
in
i
want
to
get
some
cigarettes
anyhow
you
can
walk
down
with
me
till
i
do
i
walk
down
with
you
replied
ida
but
i
sha
go
in
they
drew
near
to
the
imperial
the
street
about
was
deserted
even
the
usual
hacks
that
had
their
stand
there
were
gone
you
see
explained
vandover
as
they
passed
slowly
in
front
of
the
doors
this
is
all
quiet
enough
if
you
pulled
down
your
veil
no
one
would
know
the
difference
and
here
the
ladies
entrance
you
see
right
at
the
side
all
right
come
along
let
go
in
exclaimed
ida
suddenly
and
before
he
knew
it
they
had
swung
open
the
little
door
of
the
ladies
entrance
with
its
frosted
pane
of
glass
and
had
stepped
inside
it
was
between
nine
and
ten
and
the
imperial
was
quiet
as
yet
a
few
men
were
drinking
in
the
barroom
outside
and
toby
the
waiter
was
talking
in
low
tones
to
a
girl
under
one
of
the
electric
lights
vandover
and
ida
went
into
one
of
the
larger
rooms
in
the
rear
passage
and
shut
the
door
ida
pushed
her
bolero
jacket
from
her
shoulders
saying
this
seems
nice
and
quiet
enough
well
of
course
answered
vandover
as
though
dismissing
the
question
for
good
now
what
are
we
going
to
have
i
say
we
have
champagne
and
oysters
let
have
cliquot
then
exclaimed
ida
which
was
the
only
champagne
she
had
ever
heard
of
besides
the
california
brands
she
was
very
excited
this
was
the
kind
of
gay
time
she
delighted
in
champagne
suppers
with
men
late
at
night
she
had
never
been
in
such
a
place
as
the
imperial
before
and
the
daring
and
novelty
of
what
she
had
done
the
whiff
of
the
great
city
vice
caught
in
this
manner
sent
a
little
tremor
of
pleasure
and
excitement
over
all
her
nerves
they
did
not
hurry
over
their
little
supper
but
ate
and
drank
slowly
and
had
more
oysters
to
go
with
the
last
half
of
their
bottle
face
was
ablaze
her
eyes
flashing
her
blond
hair
disordered
and
falling
about
her
cheeks
vandover
put
his
arm
about
her
neck
and
drew
her
toward
him
and
as
she
sank
down
upon
him
smiling
and
complaisant
her
hair
tumbling
upon
her
shoulders
and
her
head
and
throat
bent
back
he
leaned
his
cheek
against
hers
speaking
in
a
low
voice
no
no
she
murmured
smiling
never
ah
if
i
had
come
no
van
please
and
then
with
a
long
breath
she
abandoned
herself
about
midnight
he
left
her
at
the
door
of
her
house
on
golden
gate
avenue
on
their
way
home
ida
had
grown
more
serious
than
he
had
ever
known
her
to
be
now
she
began
to
cry
softly
to
herself
oh
van
she
said
putting
her
head
down
upon
his
shoulder
oh
i
am
so
you
do
think
any
less
of
me
do
you
oh
van
you
must
be
true
to
me
now
chapter
six
everybody
in
san
francisco
knew
of
the
ravises
and
always
made
it
a
point
to
speak
of
them
as
one
of
the
best
families
of
the
city
they
were
not
new
and
they
were
not
particularly
rich
they
had
lived
in
the
same
house
on
california
street
for
nearly
twenty
years
and
had
always
been
comfortably
well
off
as
things
go
in
san
francisco
they
were
they
had
family
traditions
and
usages
and
customs
their
library
had
been
in
process
of
collection
for
the
past
half
century
and
the
pictures
on
the
walls
were
oil
paintings
of
steel
engravings
and
genuine
chromos
beyond
price
their
furniture
and
ornaments
were
of
the
preceding
generation
solid
conservative
they
were
not
chosen
with
reference
to
any
one
style
nor
all
bought
at
the
same
time
each
separate
piece
had
an
individuality
of
its
own
the
ravises
kept
their
old
things
long
after
the
fashion
had
gone
out
preferring
them
to
the
smarter
art
objects
on
account
of
their
associations
there
were
six
in
the
family
and
ravis
turner
and
her
older
brother
stanley
yale
a
very
serious
young
gentleman
of
continually
professing
an
interest
in
economics
and
finance
besides
these
were
the
two
children
howard
nine
years
old
and
his
sister
aged
fourteen
who
had
been
christened
virginia
they
were
a
race
ravis
senior
belonged
to
the
bohemian
club
but
was
seldom
seen
there
stanley
was
absorbed
in
his
law
business
and
turner
went
out
but
little
they
much
preferred
each
other
society
to
that
of
three
fourths
of
their
acquaintances
most
of
their
friends
being
friends
of
the
family
who
came
to
dinner
three
or
four
times
a
year
it
was
a
custom
of
theirs
to
spend
the
evenings
in
the
big
at
the
back
of
the
house
after
the
table
had
been
cleared
away
ravis
and
stanley
reading
the
papers
the
one
smoking
his
cigar
the
other
his
pipe
ravis
with
the
magazines
and
turner
with
the
howard
and
virginia
appropriated
the
table
to
themselves
where
they
played
with
their
soldiers
and
backgammon
board
the
family
kept
two
servants
june
the
china
boy
who
had
been
with
them
since
the
beginning
of
things
and
delphine
the
cook
a
more
recent
acquisition
june
was
in
a
way
butler
and
second
boy
combined
he
did
all
the
downstairs
work
and
the
heavy
sweeping
but
it
was
another
custom
for
ravis
and
turner
to
spend
part
of
every
morning
in
putting
the
bedrooms
to
rights
dusting
and
making
up
the
beds
besides
this
turner
exercised
a
sort
of
supervision
over
howard
and
virginia
who
were
too
old
for
a
nurse
but
too
young
to
take
care
of
themselves
she
had
them
to
bed
at
nine
mended
some
of
their
clothes
made
them
take
their
baths
regularly
reëstablished
peace
between
them
in
their
hourly
quarrels
and
most
arduous
task
of
all
saw
that
howard
properly
washed
himself
every
morning
and
on
wednesday
and
saturday
afternoons
that
he
was
suitably
dressed
in
time
for
dancing
school
it
was
sunday
afternoon
ravis
was
reading
to
her
husband
who
lay
on
the
sofa
in
the
smoking
a
cigar
stanley
had
gone
out
to
make
a
call
while
howard
and
virginia
had
forgathered
in
the
bathroom
to
sail
their
boats
and
cigar
boxes
in
the
tub
toward
three
as
turner
was
in
her
room
writing
letters
the
rang
she
stopped
with
her
pen
in
the
air
wondering
if
it
might
be
vandover
it
was
june
afternoon
out
in
a
few
minutes
the
bell
rang
again
and
turner
ran
down
to
answer
it
herself
intercepting
delphine
who
took
june
place
on
these
occasions
but
who
was
hopelessly
stupid
ravis
had
peered
out
through
the
curtains
of
the
parlour
window
to
see
who
it
was
and
turner
met
her
and
ravis
coming
upstairs
abandoning
the
parlour
to
turner
caller
mamma
and
i
are
going

parlour

turner
mother

him
to
stay

tea
well
said
turner
doubtfully
as
she
paused
at
the
foot
of
the
stairs

will
but
you
know
we
never
have
anything
to
speak
of
for
sunday
evening
tea
june

out
and
you
know
how
clumsy
and
stupid
delphine
is
when
she
waits
on
the
table
it
young
haight
turner
was
very
glad
to
see
him
for
next
to
vandover
she
liked
him
better
than
any
of
the
others
she
was
never
bored
by
being
obliged
to
entertain
him
and
he
always
had
something
to
say
and
some
clever
way
of
saying
it
about
five
as
they
were
talking
about
amateur
photography
ravis
came
in
and
called
them
to
tea
tea
with
the
ravises
was
the
tea
of
twenty
years
ago
one
never
saw
any
of
the
modern
delicacies
on
their
sunday
evening
table
no
enticing
cold
lunch
no
spices
not
even
catsups
or
pepper
sauces
the
turkey
or
chicken
they
had
had
for
dinner
was
served
cold
in
slices
there
was
canned
fruit
preserves
tea
crackers
bread
and
butter
a
large
dish
of
cold
pork
and
beans
and
a
huge
glass
pitcher
of
in
the
absence
of
june
delphine
the
cook
went
through
the
agony
of
waiting
on
the
table
very
nervous
and
embarrassed
in
her
clean
calico
gown
and
starched
apron
her
hands
were
red
and
knotty
smelling
of
soap
and
they
touched
the
chinaware
with
an
and
constraining
tenderness
as
if
the
plates
and
dishes
had
been
delicate
glass
butterflies
she
stood
off
at
a
distance
from
the
table
making
sudden
and
awkward
dabs
at
it
when
it
came
to
passing
the
plates
she
passed
them
on
the
wrong
side
and
remembered
herself
at
the
wrong
moment
with
a
stammering
apology
in
her
excess
of
politeness
she
kept
up
a
constant
murmur
as
she
attended
to
their
wants
another
fork
yes
sir
she
get
it
right
away
sir
did
ravis
want
another
cuppa
tea
no
no
more
tea

she
pass
the
bread

bread

howard
nice
french
bread
he
always
liked
that
some
more
preserved
pears
miss
ravis
yes

she
get
them
right
away
they
were
just
over
here
on
the
sideboard
yes
here
they
were
no
more
now
she
go
and
put
them
back
and
at
last
when
she
had
set
the
nerves
of
all
of
them
in
a
jangle
was
dismissed
to
the
kitchen
and
retired
with
a
gasp
of
unspeakable
relief
somewhat
later
in
the
evening
young
haight
was
alone
with
turner
and
their
conversation
had
taken
a
very
unusual
and
personal
turn
all
at
once
turner
exclaimed
i
often
wonder
what
good
i
am
in
the
world
to
anybody
i
do
a
thing
i
ca
a
thing
i
could
cook
the
plainest
kind
of
a
meal
to
me
and
it
took
me
all
of
two
hours
yesterday
to
do
just
a
little
buttonhole
stitching
i
not
good
for
anything
i
not
a
help
to
anybody
young
haight
looked
into
the
blue
flame
of
the
almost
the
only
modern
innovation
throughout
the
entire
house
and
was
silent
for
a
moment
then
he
leaned
his
elbows
on
his
knees
and
still
looking
at
the
flame
replied
i
do
know
about
that
you
have
been
a
considerable
help
to
to
exclaimed
turner
surprised
a
help
to
why
how
do
you
mean
well
he
answered
still
without
looking
at
her
one
always
has
influence
you
know
ah
lots
of
influence
have
over
anybody
retorted
turner
incredulously
yes
you
have
he
insisted
you
have
plenty
of
influence
over
the
people
that
care
for
you
you
have
plenty
of
influence
over
me
turner
very
much
embarrassed
and
not
knowing
how
to
answer
bent
down
to
the
side
of
the
mantelpiece
and
turned
up
the
flame
of
the
a
little
young
haight
continued
almost
as
embarrassed
as
she
i
suppose
i
a
bad
lot
perhaps
a
little
worse
than
most
others
but
i
think
i
hope
there
some
good
in
me
i
know
all
this
sounds
absurd
and
affected
but
i
not
posing
you
wo
mind
if
i
speak
just
as
i
think
for
this
once
i
promise
he
went
on
with
a
half
smile
not
to
do
it
again
you
know
my
mother
died
when
i
was
little
and
i
have
lived
mostly
with
men
you
have
been
to
me
what
the
society
of
women
has
been
to
other
fellows
you
see
you
are
the
only
girl
i
ever
knew
very
well
the
only
one
i
ever
wanted
to
know
i
have
cared
for
you
the
way
other
men
have
cared
for
the
different
women
that
come
into
their
lives
as
they
have
cared
for
their
mothers
their
sisters
and
their
wives
you
have
already
influenced
me
as
a
mother
or
sister
should
have
done
what
if
i
should
ever
ask
you
to
be
to
be
the
to
me
the
one
that
best
of
all
young
haight
turned
toward
her
as
he
finished
and
looked
at
her
for
the
first
time
turner
was
still
very
much
embarrassed
oh
i
very
glad
if
i
been
a
help
to
to
anybody
to
you
she
said
confusedly
but
i
never
knew
that
you
cared
that
you
thought
about
me
in
that
way
but
you
must
you
know
you
must
care
for
me
in
that
way
i
ought
to
tell
you
right
away
that
i
never
could
care
for
you
more
than
i
always
have
done
i
mean
care
for
you
only
as
a
very
very
good
friend
you
do
know
dolly
she
went
on
eagerly
how
it
hurts
me
to
tell
you
so
because
i
care
so
much
for
you
in
every
other
way
that
i
would
hurt
your
feelings
for
anything
but
then
you
know
at
the
same
time
it
would
hurt
you
a
great
deal
more
if
i
tell
you
but
encourage
you
and
let
you
go
on
thinking
that
perhaps
i
liked
you
more
than
any
one
else
when
i
now
would
that
be
wrong
you
do
know
how
glad
it
makes
me
feel
that
i
have
been
of
some
good
to
you
and
that
is
just
why
i
want
to
be
sincere
and
not
make
you
think
any
less
of
me
think
any
worse
of
me
oh
i
know
answered
young
haight
i
know
i
should
have
said
anything
about
it
i
knew
beforehand
or
thought
i
knew
that
you
care
in
that
way
maybe
i
have
been
wrong
she
replied
in
not
seeing
that
you
cared
so
much
and
have
given
you
a
wrong
impression
i
thought
you
knew
how
it
was
all
the
time
knew
how
what
was
he
asked
looking
up
why
she
said
knew
how
van
and
i
were
i
knew
that
van
cared
for
you
a
great
deal
yes
but
you
know
she
went
on
hesitating
and
confused
you
know
we
are
engaged
we
have
been
engaged
for
nearly
two
years
but
do
consider
himself
as
engaged
the
words
were
almost
out
of
haight
mouth
but
he
shut
his
teeth
against
them
and
kept
silence
he
hardly
knew
why
suppose
vandover
were
out
of
the
question
he
said
getting
up
and
smiling
in
order
not
to
seem
as
serious
as
he
really
was
ah
she
said
smiling
back
at
him
i
do
know
that
a
hard
question
to
answer
i
never
myself
question
well
i
saving
you
the
trouble
you
see
he
answered
still
smiling
i
am
asking
it
you
but
i
do
want
to
answer
such
a
question
like
that
how
can
i
tell
it
would
only
be
just
now
young
haight
answered
quickly
that
just
now
he
would
be
contented
with
that
perhaps
but
turner
did
not
hear
this
she
had
spoken
at
the
same
time
as
he
exclaiming
but
what
is
the
good
of
talking
of
that
because
no
matter
what
happened
i
feel
as
though
i
could
not
break
my
promise
to
van
even
if
i
should
want
to
because
i
have
talked
like
this
dolly
she
went
on
more
seriously
you
must
not
be
deceived
or
get
a
wrong
impression
you
understand
how
things
are
do
you
oh
yes
he
answered
still
trying
to
carry
it
off
with
a
laugh
i
know
i
know
but
now
i
hope
you
wo
let
anything
i
have
said
bother
you
and
that
things
will
go
on
just
as
if
i
had
spoken
just
as
if
nothing
had
happened
why
of
course
she
said
laughing
with
him
again
of
why
should
they
they
were
both
at
their
ease
again
by
the
time
young
haight
stood
at
the
door
with
his
hat
in
his
hand
ready
to
go
he
raised
his
free
hand
over
her
head
and
said
with
burlesque
dramatic
effect
trying
to
keep
down
a
smile
bless
you
both
go
go
marry
vandover
and
be
happy
i
forgive
you
ah
do
be
so
absurd
she
cried
beginning
to
laugh
chapter
seven
on
a
certain
evening
about
four
months
later
ellis
and
vandover
had
a
date
with
ida
wade
and
bessie
laguna
at
the
mechanics
fair
ellis
bessie
and
ida
were
to
meet
vandover
there
in
the
art
gallery
as
he
had
to
make
a
call
with
his
father
and
could
not
get
there
until
nine
they
were
all
to
walk
about
the
fair
until
ten
after
which
the
two
men
proposed
to
take
the
girls
out
to
the
cliff
house
in
separate
coupés
the
whole
thing
had
been
arranged
by
ellis
and
bessie
and
vandover
was
irritated
ellis
ought
to
have
had
more
sense
rushing
the
girls
was
all
very
well
but
everybody
went
to
the
mechanics
fair
and
he
did
like
to
have
nice
girls
like
turner
or
henrietta
vance
see
him
with
chippies
like
that
it
was
all
very
well
for
ellis
who
had
no
social
position
but
for
vandover
it
would
look
too
confounded
queer
of
course
he
was
in
for
it
now
and
would
have
to
face
the
music
you
ca
tell
a
girl
like
that
that
you
ashamed
to
be
seen
with
her
but
very
likely
he
would
get
himself
into
a
regular
box
with
it
all
when
he
arrived
at
the
mechanics
pavilion
it
was
about
twenty
minutes
of
ten
and
as
he
pushed
through
the
wicket
he
let
himself
into
a
huge
amphitheatre
full
of
colour
and
movement
there
was
a
vast
shuffling
of
thousands
of
feet
and
a
subdued
roar
of
conversation
like
the
noise
of
a
great
mill
mingled
with
these
were
the
purring
of
distant
machinery
the
splashing
of
a
temporary
fountain
and
the
rhythmic
clamour
of
a
brass
band
while
in
the
piano
exhibit
the
hired
performer
was
playing
a
with
a
great
flourish
nearer
at
hand
one
could
catch
ends
of
conversation
and
notes
of
laughter
the
creaking
of
boots
and
the
rustle
of
moving
dresses
and
stiff
skirts
here
and
there
groups
of
school
children
elbowed
their
way
through
the
crowd
crying
shrilly
their
hands
full
of
advertisement
pamphlets
fans
picture
cards
and
toy
whips
with
pewter
whistles
on
the
butts
while
the
air
itself
was
full
of
the
smell
of
fresh
popcorn
ellis
and
bessie
were
in
the
art
gallery
upstairs
wade
mother
who
gave
lessons
in
hand
painting
had
an
exhibit
there
which
they
were
interested
to
find
a
bunch
of
yellow
poppies
painted
on
velvet
and
framed
in
gilt
they
stood
before
it
some
little
time
hazarding
their
opinions
and
then
moved
on
from
one
picture
to
another
ellis
bought
a
catalogue
and
made
it
a
duty
to
find
the
title
of
every
picture
bessie
professed
to
be
very
fond
of
painting
she
had
it
up
at
one
time
and
had
abandoned
it
only
because
the
oil
or
turpentine
or
something
was
unhealthy
for
her
of
course
she
said
i
no
critic
i
only
know
what
i
like
now
that
one
over
there
i
like
i
think
those
ideal
heads

ellis
we
saw
him
just
now
over
by
the
chess
machine
i
guess
i
try
and
find
him
then
responded
vandover
well
i
hope
you
two
enjoy
yourselves
as
he
was
turning
away
bessie
laguna
came
running
back
and
taking
him
a
little
to
one
side
said
you
better
go
round
and
see
ida
pretty
soon
if
you
can
she
all
broke
up
about
something
i
sure
i
think
she
like
to
see
you
pretty
well
honestly
she
said
suddenly
very
grave
i
never
saw
ida
so
cut
up
in
my
life
she
been
taking
on
over
something
in
a
dreadful
way
and
i
think
she
like
to
see
you
she
wo
tell
anything
you
go
around
and
see
her
all
right
answered
vandover
smiling
i
go
as
he
was
going
down
the
stairs
on
his
way
to
find
young
haight
it
occurred
to
him
what
ida
trouble
might
be
he
was
all
at
once
struck
with
a
great
fear
so
that
for
an
instant
he
turned
cold
and
weak
and
reached
out
his
hand
to
steady
himself
against
the
railing
of
the
stairs
ah
what
a
calamity
that
would
be
what
a
calamity
what
a
dreadful
responsibility
what
a
crime
he
could
not
keep
the
thought
out
of
his
mind
he
tried
to
tell
himself
that
ida
had
practically
given
her
consent
by
going
into
such
a
place
that
he
was
not
the
only
one
after
all
that
there
was
nothing
certain
as
yet
he
stood
on
the
stairway
empty
for
that
moment
biting
the
end
of
his
thumb
saying
to
himself
in
a
low
voice
what
a
calamity
what
a
horrible
calamity
that
would
be
ah
you
scoundrel
you
damned
fool
not
to
have
thought
a
couple
of
girls
the
counter
girls
at
one
of
the
candy
booths
came
down
the
stairs
behind
him
with
a
great
babble
of
talk
vandover
gave
an
irritated
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
if
freeing
himself
from
the
disagreeable
subject
and
went
on
he
could
not
find
young
haight
down
stairs
and
so
went
up
into
the
gallery
again
after
a
long
time
he
came
upon
him
sitting
on
an
empty
bench
nursing
his
cane
and
watching
the
crowd
go
past
hello
old
man
he
exclaimed
ellis
told
me
i
would
find
you
around
somewhere
i
was
just
going
to
give
you
up
he
sat
down
beside
his
chum
and
the
two
began
to
talk
about
the
people
as
they
passed
ah
get
on
to
the
red
hat
exclaimed
vandover
on
a
sudden
that
the
third
time
she
passed
has
ellis
gone
off
with
bessie
laguna
asked
young
haight
yes
answered
vandover
they
going
to
have
a
time
at
the
cliff
house
that
too
bad
young
haight
replied
ellis
has
just
thrown
himself
away
with
that
girl
he
might
have
known
some
very
nice
people
when
he
first
came
here
between
that
girl
and
his
whisky
he
has
managed
to
spoil
every
chance
he
might
have
had
there

a
cocktail
in

gave
my

any
more

gave
it
to
him
straight
vandover
has
gone
daft
over
a
girl
in
a
red
hat
said
young
haight
as
they
got
up
and
began
to
walk
have
you
noticed
her
up
here
i
went
to
the
grillroom
after
i
left
the
tailor
continued
geary
and
had
supper
downtown
ah
you
ought
to
have
seen
the
steak
they
gave
me
just
about
as
thick
as
it
was
wide
i
gave
the
slavey
a
tip
oh
it
just
as
well
you
know
to
keep
in
with
them
if
you
go
there
often
i
lunch
there
four
or
five
times
a
week
they
descended
to
the
ground
floor
and
promenaded
the
central
aisle
watching
for
pretty
girls
in
front
of
a
where
there
was
a
soda
fountain
they
saw
the
red
hat
again
vandover
looked
her
squarely
in
the
face
and
laughed
a
little
when
he
had
passed
he
looked
back
the
girl
caught
his
eye
and
turned
away
with
a
droll
smile
vandover
paused
grinning
and
raising
his
hat
i
guess
that
mine
he
said
you
are
not
going
are
you
exclaimed
young
haight
as
vandover
stopped
oh
for
goodness
sake
van
do
leave
the
girls
alone
for
one
hour
in
the
day
come
on
come
on
downtown
with

no
no
answered
vandover
i
going
to
chase
it
up
i
may
see
you
fellows
later
and
he
turned
back
and
went
up
to
the
girl
look
at
that
said
young
haight
exasperated
he
knows
he
liable
to
meet
his
acquaintances
here
and
yet
there
he
goes
almost
arm
in
arm
with
a
girl
like
that
it
too
bad
why
a
fellow
keep
straight
when
there
are
such
a
lot
of
girls
geary
never
liked
to
see
anything
done
better
than
he
could
do
it
himself
just
now
he
was
vexed
because
vandover
had
got
in
ahead
of
him
he
looked
after
the
girl
a
moment
and
muttered
scornfully
cheap
meat
adding
ah
you
bet
would
do
that
i
flatter
myself
that
i
a
little
too
clever
to
cut
my
own
throat
in
that
fashion
i
look
out
after
my
interests
better
than
that

answered
young
haight
luxembourg

then
assented
geary
and
they
turned
about
and
started
for
the
door
as
they
were
passing
out
some
one
came
running
up
behind
them
and
took
an
arm
of
each
it
was
vandover

geary
delighted

cried
geary
ca

trailing
around
after
some
kind
of
petticoats
you

admitted
vandover
i
ca
but
he
persuaded
them
to
go
to
the
imperial
for
all
that
at
the
imperial
toby
the
waiter
came
to
take
their
order
good

said

for
some
time
no

said
geary
i

too
busy
i

all
right
all
right

a
stringy
rabbit

a
pint
of
you

he
continued
after
they
had
settled
down
to
their
beer
and
rabbits
working
like
a
dog
a
man
got
to
rustle
if
he
going
to
make
a
success
at
law
going
to
make

next
man
every
man
for
himself
that
what
say
the
way

get
along
it
may
be
selfish
but
you
got
to
do
it
by
god
it
human
nature
is
that
right
hey
is
that
right
oh
that
right
admitted
young
haight
trying
to
be
polite
after
this
the
conversation
lagged
a
little
young
haight
drank
his
apollinaris
lemonade
through
a
straw
geary
sipped
his
ale
and
vandover
fed
himself
welsh
rabbit
and
spanish
olives
with
the
silent
enjoyment
of
a
glutton
by
and
by
when
they
had
finished
and
had
lighted
their
cigars
and
cigarettes
they
began
to
talk
about
the
last
cotillon
to
which
vandover
and
haight
belonged
say
van
said
young
haight
tilting
his
head
to
one
side
and
shutting
one
eye
to
avoid
the
smoke
from
his
cigar
say
did
i
see
you
dancing
with
doane
after
supper
yes
said
vandover
laughing
all
the
men
were
trying
to
get
a
dance
with
her
she
had
an
edge
on
no
exclaimed
geary
incredulously
that
a
fact
admitted
young
haight
van
is
right
she
was
opposite
to
me
at
table
said
vandover
and
saw
her
empty
a
whole
bottle
of
champagne
why
i
did
know
they
got
drunk
like
that
at
the
cotillons
said
geary
i
thought
they
were
very
swell
well
of
course
they
do
as
a
rule
returned
vandover
of
course
there
are
girls
like
like
henrietta
vance
who
belong
to
the
cotillon
and
make
it
what
it
is
and
what
it
ought
to
be
but
there
are
other
girls
like
doane
and
lilly
stannard
and
the
trafford
girls
that
like
their
champagne
pretty
well
now
and
do
you
forget
it
oh
you
know
i
would
call
it
getting
drunk
though
well
why
not
exclaimed
young
haight
impatiently
why
not
call
it
drunk
why
not
call
things
by
their
right
name
you
can
see
just
how
bad
they
are
then
and
i
think
it
shameful
that
such
things
can
go
on
in
an
organization
that
is
supposed
to
contain
the
very
best
people
in
the
city
now
i
just
want
to
tell
you
what
i
saw
at
one
of
these
same
cotillons
in
the
first
part
of
the
season
lilly
stannard
disappeared
after
supper
and
people
said
she
was
sick
and
was
going
home
but
i
knew
exactly
what
was
the
matter
because
i
had
seen
her
at
the
supper
table
well
i
had
gone
outside
on
the
steps
to
get
a
mouthful
of
smoke
and
my
little
cousin
hetty
who
has
just
come
out
and
who
is
only
nineteen
was
out
there
with
me
because
it
was
so
warm
inside
and
had
seen
lilly
stannard
filling
up
with
champagne
at
supper
and
did
know
what
to
make
of
it
well
we
were
just
talking
about
it
and
i
was
trying
to
make
her
believe
too
that
lilly
stannard
was
sick
when
here
comes
lilly
herself
out
to
her
carriage
her
maid
was
supporting
her
just
about
her
lilly
face
was
so
pale
that
the
powder
on
it
looked
like
ashes
her
hair
was
all
coming
down
and
she
was
hiccoughing
now
continued
young
haight
his
eyes
snapping
and
his
voice
raised
so
as
to
make
itself
heard
above
the
exclamations
of
his
two
friends
now
that
a
i
give
you
my
word
of
honour
that
it
actually
happened
it
not
hearsay
i
saw
it
myself
it
fine
is
it
he
went
on
wrathfully
it
sounds
well
do
it
when
it
told
as
it
the
girl
was
dead
drunk
oh
she
may
have
made
a
mistake
it
may
have
been
the
first
time
but
the
fact
remains
that
she
always
drinks
a
lot
of
champagne
at
the
cotillons
and
other
girls
have
been
drunk
there
too
doane
that
van
tells
about
was
that
the
word
for
it
she
was
dead
drunk
that
night
and
there
was
my
little
cousin
hetty
who
had
never
seen
even
a
man
the
worse
for
his
liquor
standing
there
and
taking
it
all
in
of
course
every
one
hushed
the
thing
up
or
else
said
the
poor
girl
was
sick
but
hetty
knew
and
what
effect
do
you
suppose
it
had
upon
a
little
girl
like
that
who
had
always
been
told
what
nice
irreproachable
people
went
to
the
cotillons
hetty
will
never
be
the
same
little
girl
now
that
she
was
before
oh
it
makes
me
damned
tired
well
i
do
see
said
geary
why
the
girls
should
make
such
a
fuss
about
the
men
keeping
straight
i
daresay
now
that
this
stannard
girl
would
cut
us
all
dead
if
she
knew
how
drunk
we
were
that
night
about
four
months
ago
that
night
that
you
fellows
got
thrown
out
of
the
luxembourg
no
i
do
believe
she
would
at
all
said
young
haight
she
think
better
of
you
for
it
put
in
vandover
look
here
he
went
on
all
this
talk
of
women
demanding
the
same
moral
standard
for
men
as
men
do
for
women
is
fine
on
paper
but
how
does
it
work
in
real
life
the
women
do
demand
it
at
all
take
the
average
society
girl
in
a
big
city
like
this
the
girls
that
we
meet
at
teas
and
receptions
and
functions
do
you
suppose
they
know
the
life
we
men
lead
of
course
they
do
they
may
not
know
it
in
detail
but
they
know
in
a
general
way
that
we
get
drunk
a
good
deal
and
go
to
disreputable
houses
and
that
sort
of
thing
and
do
they
ever
cut
us
for
that
no
sir
not
much
why
i
tell
you
they
even
have
a
little
more
respect
for
us
they
like
a
man
to
know
things
to
be
experienced
a
man
that
keeps
himself
straight
and
clean
and
never
goes
around
with
fast
women
they
think
is
ridiculous
of
course
a
girl
do
want
to
know
the
particulars
of
a
man
vice
what
they
want
is
that
a
man
should
have
the
knowledge
of
good
and
evil
yes
and
lots
of
evil
to
a
large
extent
i
really
believe
it
the
women
fault
that
the
men
are
what
they
are
if
they
demanded
a
higher
moral
standard
the
men
would
come
up
to
it
they
encourage
a
man
to
go
to
the
devil
and
then
and
then
when
he
rotten
with
disease
and
ruins
his
wife
and
has
children
what
is
it
there
a
great
cry
raised
against
the
men
and
women
write
books
and
all
when
half
the
time
the
woman
has
only
encouraged
him
to
be
what
he
is
oh
well
now
retorted
young
haight
you
know
that
all
the
girls
are
not
like
that
most
of
them
that
you
meet
in
society
are
but
they
are
the
best
people
are
they
demanded
geary
no
answered
vandover
and
young
haight
in
a
breath
and
young
haight
continued
no
i
believe
that
very
few
of
what
you
would
call
the
people
go
out
in
society
people
like
the
ravises
who
have
good
principles
and
keep
up
virtues
and
all
that
you
know
he
added
they
have
family
prayers
down
there
every
morning
after
breakfast
geary
began
to
smile
well
now
i
do
care
retorted
young
haight
i
like
that
sort
of
thing
so
do
i
said
vandover
up
home
now
the
governor
asks
a
blessing
at
each
meal
and
somehow
i
would
like
to
see
him
leave
it
off
but
you
ca
tell
me
he
went
on
going
back
to
the
original
subject
of
their
discussion
you
ca
tell
me
that
american
society
girls
and
living
at
the
end
of
the
nineteenth
century
do
know
about
things
why
man
alive
how
can
they
help
but
know
look
at
those
that
have
brothers
do
you
suppose
they
know
and
if
they
know
why
they
use
their
influence
to
stop
it
i
tell
you
if
any
one
were
to
write
up
the
lives
that
we
young
men
of
the
city
lead
after
dark
people
would
believe
it
at
that
party
that
henrietta
vance
gave
last
month
there
were
about
twenty
fellows
there
and
i
knew
every
one
and
i
was
looking
around
the
and
wondering
how
many
of
those
young
fellows
had
never
been
inside
of
a
disreputable
house
and
there
was
only
beside
dolly
haight
young
haight
exclaimed
at
this
laughing
twirling
his
thumbs
and
casting
down
his
eyes
with
well
that
the
truth
just
the
same
vandover
went
on
we
young
men
of
the
cities
are
a
fine
lot
i
not
doing
the
baby
act
i
not
laying
the
blame
on
the
girls
altogether
but
i
say
that
in
a
measure
the
girls
are
responsible
they
want
a
man
to
be
a
to
be
up
to
date
to
be
a
man
of
the
world
and
to
go
in
for
that
sort
of
vice
but
they
know
they
do
dream
how
rotten
and
disgusting
it
is
oh
i
not
preaching
i
know
i
just
as
bad
as
the
rest
and
i
going
to
have
a
good
time
while
i
can
but
sometimes
when
you
stop
and
think
and
as
dolly
says
things
by
their
right
names
why
you
feel
do
you
know
i
do
believe
van
responded
young
haight
that
it
as
bad
as
you
say
but
it
even
wrong
i
think
that
a
good
girl
should
know
anything
about
vice
at
all
oh
that
nonsense
broke
in
geary
you
ca
expect
nowadays
that
a
girl
an
american
girl
can
live
twenty
years
in
a
city
and
not
know
things
do
you
think
the
average
modern
girl
is
going
to
be
the
absolutely
pure
and
innocent
girl
of
say
fifty
years

not
much
they
are
right
on
to
things
you
ca
tell
them
much
and
all
right
too
they
know
how
to
look
out
for
themselves
then
part
of
their
education
and
i
think
if
they
have
the
knowledge
of
evil
and
do
know
what
sort
of
life
the
average
young
man
leads
that
their
mothers
ought
to
tell
them
well
i
do
agree
with
you
retorted
young
haight
something
revolting
in
the
idea
that
it
necessary
a
young
girl
should
be
instructed
in
that
sort
of
nastiness
why
not
at
all
answered
geary
without
it
she
might
be
ruined
by
the
first
man
that
came
along
it
a
protection
to
her
virtue
oh
pshaw
i
do
believe
it
at
all
cried
young
haight
impatiently
i
believe
that
a
girl
is
born
with
a
natural
intuitive
purity
that
will
lead
her
to
protect
her
virtue
just
as
instinctively
as
she
would
dodge
a
blow
if
she
wants
to
go
wrong
she
will
have
to
make
an
effort
herself
to
overcome
that
instinct
and
if
she
do
cried
vandover
eagerly
if
she
do
if
she
protect
her
virtue
i
say
a
man
has
a
right
to
go
as
far
with
her
as
he
can
if
do
some
one
else
will
said
geary
ah
you
ca
get
around
it
that
way
answered
young
haight
smiling
it
a
man
duty
to
protect
a
girl
even
if
he
has
to
protect
her
against
herself
when
he
got
home
that
night
vandover
thought
over
this
remark
of
young
haight
and
in
its
light
reviewed
what
had
occurred
in
the
room
at
the
imperial
he
felt
aroused
nervous
miserably
anxious
at
length
he
tried
to
dismiss
the
subject
from
his
mind
he
woke
up
his
drowsing
grate
fire
punching
it
with
the
poker
talking
to
it
saying
wake
up
there
you
when
he
was
undressed
he
sat
down
before
it
in
his
bathrobe
absorbing
its
heat
luxuriously
musing
into
the
coals
scratching
himself
as
was
his
custom
but
for
all
that
he
fretted
nervously
and
did
not
sleep
well
that
night
next
morning
he
took
his
bath
vandover
enjoyed
his
bath
and
usually
spent
two
or
three
hours
over
it
when
the
water
was
very
warm
he
got
into
it
with
his
novel
on
a
rack
in
front
of
him
and
a
box
of
chocolates
conveniently
near
here
he
stayed
for
over
an
hour
eating
and
reading
and
occasionally
smoking
a
cigarette
until
at
length
the
enervating
heat
of
the
steam
gradually
overcame
him
and
he
dropped
off
to
sleep
on
this
particular
morning
between
nine
and
ten
geary
called
and
as
was
his
custom
came
right
up
to
vandover
room
corkle
lying
on
the
wolfskin
in
the
bay
window
jumped
up
with
a
gruff
bark
but
recognizing
him
came
up
wiggling
his
short
tail
geary
saw
clothes
thrown
about
the
floor
and
the
closed
door
of
the
bathroom
hey

called
it

in

geary
and
nobody

why
she
did
leave
any
message
or
letter
or
anything
of
the
kind
it
a
fearful
thing
to
happen
so
suddenly
but
it
seems
she
has
been
very
despondent
and
broke
up
about
something
or
other
for
a
week
or
two
they
found
her
in
her
room
last
night
about
ten
lying
across
her
table
with
only
her
wrapper
on
she
was
unconscious
then
and
between
one
and
two
she
died
she
was
unconscious
all
the
time
well
i
ca
stop
any
longer
van
i
an
appointment
downtown
i
was
just
going
past
the
house
and
i
thought
i
would
run
up
and
speak
to
you
about
ida
i
see
you
again
pretty
soon
and
talk
this
over
corkle
politely
attended
geary
to
the
head
of
the
stairs
then
went
back
to
vandover
room
and
after
blowing
under
the
crack
of
the
bathroom
door
to
see
if
his
master
was
still
there
returned
to
the
wolfskin
and
sat
down
on
his
short
tail
and
yawned
he
was
impatient
to
see
vandover
and
thought
he
stayed
in
his
bath
an
unnecessarily
long
time
he
went
up
to
the
door
again
and
listened
it
was
very
still
inside
he
could
not
hear
the
slightest
sound
and
he
wondered
again
what
could
keep
vandover
in
there
so
long
he
had
too
much
to
whine
so
he
went
back
to
the
wolfskin
and
curled
up
in
the
sun
but
did
not
go
to
sleep
by
and
by
after
a
very
long
time
the
bathroom
door
swung
open
and
vandover
came
out
he
had
not
dried
himself
and
was
naked
and
wet
he
went
directly
to
the
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
and
picked
up
the
morning
paper
looking
for
the
article
of
which
geary
had
spoken
at
first
he
could
not
find
it
and
then
it
suddenly
jumped
into
prominence
from
out
the
gray
blur
of
the
print
on
an
inside
page
beside
an
advertisement
of
a
charity
concert
for
the
benefit
of
a
home
for
incurable
children
there
was
a
picture
of
ida
taken
from
a
photograph
like
one
that
she
had
given
him
and
which
even
then
was
thrust
between
the
frame
and
glass
of
his
mirror
he
read
the
article
through
it
sketched
her
life
and
character
and
the
circumstances
of
her
death
with
the
relentless
terseness
of
the
writer
cramped
for
space
according
to
this
view
the
causes
of
her
death
were
unknown
it
had
been
remarked
that
she
had
of
late
been
despondent
and
in
ill
health
vandover
threw
the
paper
down
and
straightened
up
naked
and
dripping
putting
both
hands
to
his
head
in
a
low
voice
under
his
breath
he
said
what
have
i
done
what
have
i
done
now
like
the
sudden
unrolling
of
a
great
scroll
he
saw
his
responsibility
for
her
death
and
for
the
ruin
of
that
something
in
her
which
was
more
than
life
what
would
become
of
her
now
and
what
would
become
of
him
for
a
single
brief
instant
he
tried
to
persuade
himself
that
ida
had
consented
after
all
but
he
knew
that
this
was
not
so
she
had
consented
but
he
had
forced
her
consent
he
was
none
the
less
guilty
and
then
in
that
dreadful
moment
when
he
saw
things
in
their
true
light
all
the
screens
of
conventionality
and
sophistry
torn
away
the
words
that
young
haight
had
spoken
came
back
to
him
no
matter
if
she
had
consented
it
was
his
duty
to
have
protected
her
even
against
herself
he
walked
the
floor
with
great
strides
steaming
with
the
warm
water
striking
his
head
with
his
hands
and
crying
out
oh
this
is
fearful
fearful
what
have
i
done
now
i
have
killed
her
yes
and
worse
he
could
think
of
nothing
worse
that
could
have
happened
to
him
what
a
weight
of
responsibility
to
carry
he
who
hated
responsibility
of
any
kind
who
had
always
tried
to
escape
from
anything
that
was
even
irksome
who
loved
his
ease
his
comfort
his
peace
of
mind
at
every
moment
now
he
saw
the
different
consequences
of
what
he
had
done
now
it
was
that
his
life
was
ruined
and
that
all
through
its
course
this
crime
would
hang
like
a
millstone
about
his
neck
there
could
be
no
more
enjoyment
of
anything
for
him
all
the
little
pleasures
and
little
which
till
now
had
delighted
him
were
spoiled
and
rendered
impossible
the
rest
of
his
life
would
have
to
be
one
long
penitence
any
pleasure
he
might
take
would
only
make
his
crime
seem
more
abominable
now
it
was
a
furious
revolt
against
his
mistake
that
had
led
him
to
such
a
fearful
misunderstanding
of
ida
a
silent
impotent
rage
against
himself
and
against
the
brute
in
him
that
he
had
permitted
to
drag
him
to
this
thing
now
it
was
a
wave
of
an
immense
pity
for
the
dead
girl
that
overcame
him
and
he
saw
himself
as
another
person
destroying
what
she
most
cherished
for
the
sake
of
gratifying
an
unclean
passion
now
it
was
a
terror
for
himself
what
would
they
do
to
him
his
part
in
the
affair
was
sure
to
be
found
out
he
tried
to
think
what
the
punishment
for
such
crime
would
be
but
would
he
not
be
considered
a
murderer
as
well
could
he
not
hang
for
this
his
imagination
was
never
more
active
his
fear
never
more
keen
at
once
a
thousand
plans
of
concealment
or
escape
were
tossed
up
in
his
mind
but
worse
than
all
was
the
thought
of
that
punishment
from
which
there
was
absolutely
no
escape
and
of
that
strange
other
place
where
his
crime
would
assume
right
proportions
and
receive
right
judgment
no
matter
how
it
was
palliated
or
evaded
here
then
for
an
instant
it
was
as
if
a
gulf
without
bottom
had
opened
under
him
and
he
had
to
fight
himself
back
from
its
edge
for
sheer
to
look
too
long
in
that
direction
was
simple
insanity
beyond
any
doubt
and
all
this
time
he
threw
himself
to
and
fro
in
his
room
his
long
white
arms
agitated
and
shaking
his
wet
and
shining
hair
streaming
far
over
his
face
and
the
sparse
long
fell
upon
his
legs
and
ankles
all
straight
and
trickling
with
moisture
at
times
an
immense
unreasoning
terror
would
come
upon
him
all
of
a
sudden
horrible
crushing
so
that
he
rolled
upon
the
bed
groaning
and
sobbing
digging
his
nails
into
his
scalp
shutting
his
teeth
against
a
desire
to
scream
out
writhing
in
the
throes
of
terrible
mental
agony
that
day
and
the
next
were
fearful
to
vandover
everything
in
his
world
was
changed
all
that
had
happened
before
the
morning
of
geary
visit
appeared
to
him
to
have
occurred
in
another
phase
of
his
life
years
and
years
ago
he
lay
awake
all
night
long
listening
to
the
creaking
of
the
house
and
the
drip
of
the
water
faucets
he
turned
from
his
food
with
repugnance
told
his
father
that
he
was
sick
and
kept
indoors
as
much
as
he
could
reading
all
the
papers
to
see
if
he
had
been
found
out
to
his
great
surprise
and
relief
a
theory
gained
ground
that
ida
was
subject
to
spells
of
to
long
fits
of
despondency
and
that
her
suicide
had
occurred
during
one
of
these
if
ida
family
knew
anything
of
the
truth
it
was
apparent
that
they
were
doing
their
best
to
cover
up
their
disgrace
vandover
was
too
thoroughly
terrified
for
his
own
safety
to
feel
humiliated
at
this
possible
explanation
of
his
security
there
was
as
yet
not
even
a
guess
that
implicated
him
he
thought
that
he
was
bearing
up
under
the
strain
well
enough
but
on
the
evening
of
the
second
day
as
he
was
pretending
to
eat
his
supper
his
father
sent
the
servant
out
and
turning
to
him
said
kindly
what
is
it
van
are
you
well
nowadays
not
very
sir
answered
vandover
my
throat
is
troubling
me
again
you
look
deathly
pale
returned
his
father
your
eyes
are
sunken
and
you
do
eat
yes
i
know
said
vandover
i
not
feeling
well
at
all
i
think
go
to
bed
early
i
do
know
he
continued
after
a
pause
feeling
a
desire
to
escape
from
his
father
observation
i
do
know
but
what
i
go
up
now
will
you
tell
the
cook
to
feed
corkle
for
me
his
father
looked
at
him
as
he
pushed
back
from
the
table
what
the
matter
van
he
said
is
there
anything
wrong
oh
i
be
all
right
in
the
morning
he
replied
nervously
i
feel
a
little
under
the
weather
just
now
do
you
think
you
had
better
tell
me
what
the
trouble
is
said
his
father
kindly
there
any
trouble
sir
insisted
vandover
i
just
feel
a
little
under
the
weather
but
as
he
was
starting
to
undress
in
his
room
a
sudden
impulse
took
possession
of
him
an
overwhelming
childish
desire
to
tell
his
father
all
about
it
it
was
beginning
to
be
more
than
he
was
able
to
bear
alone
he
did
not
allow
himself
to
stop
and
reason
with
this
impulse
but
slipped
on
his
vest
again
and
went
downstairs
he
found
his
father
in
the
sitting
unoccupied
in
the
huge
leather
chair
before
the
fireplace
as
vandover
came
in
the
old
gentleman
rose
and
without
a
word
as
if
he
had
been
expecting
him
went
to
the
door
and
shut
and
locked
it
he
came
back
and
stood
before
the
fireplace
watching
vandover
as
he
approached
and
took
the
chair
he
had
just
vacated
vandover
told
him
of
the
affair
in
two
or
three
phrases
without
choosing
his
words
repeating
the
same
expressions
over
and
over
again
moved
only
with
the
desire
to
have
it
over
and
done
with
it
was
like
a
burst
of
thunder
the
worst
his
father
had
feared
was
not
as
bad
as
this
he
had
expected
some
rather
serious
boyish
trouble
but
this
was
the
crime
of
a
man
still
watching
his
son
he
put
out
his
hand
groping
for
the
edge
of
the
mantelpiece
and
took
hold
of
it
with
a
firm
grasp
for
a
moment
he
said
nothing
then
and
and
you
say
you
seduced
her
without
looking
up
vandover
answered
yes
sir
and
then
he
added
it
is
horrible
when
i
think
of
it
i
sometimes
feel
as
though
i
should
go
off
my
head
i
but
the
old
gentleman
interrupted
him
putting
out
his
hand
do
he
said
quickly
do
say
anything
now
please
they
were
both
silent
for
a
long
time
vandover
gazing
stupidly
at
a
little
blue
and
red
vase
on
the
table
wondering
how
his
father
would
take
the
news
what
next
he
would
say
the
old
gentleman
drawing
his
breath
short
occasionally
clearing
his
throat
his
eyes
wandering
vaguely
about
the
walls
of
the
room
his
fingers
dancing
upon
the
edge
of
the
mantelpiece
then
at
last
he
put
his
hand
to
his
neck
as
though
loosening
his
collar
and
said
looking
away
from
vandover
wo
you
wo
you
please
go
out
go
away
for
a
little
while
leave
me
alone
for
a
little
while
when
vandover
closed
the
door
he
shut
the
edge
of
a
rug
between
it
and
the
sill
as
he
reopened
it
to
push
the
rug
out
of
the
way
he
saw
his
father
sink
into
the
chair
and
resting
his
arm
upon
the
table
bow
his
head
upon
it
he
did
not
see
his
father
again
that
night
and
at
breakfast
next
morning
not
a
word
was
exchanged
between
them
but
his
father
did
not
go
downtown
to
his
office
that
forenoon
as
was
his
custom
vandover
went
up
to
his
room
immediately
after
breakfast
and
sat
down
before
the
window
that
overlooked
the
little
garden
in
the
rear
of
the
house
he
was
utterly
miserable
his
nerves
were
gone
and
at
times
he
would
feel
again
a
touch
of
that
hysterical
unreasoning
terror
that
had
come
upon
him
so
suddenly
the
other
morning
now
there
was
a
new
trouble
the
blow
he
had
given
his
father
he
could
see
that
the
old
gentleman
was
crushed
under
it
and
that
he
had
never
imagined
that
his
son
could
have
been
so
base
as
this
vandover
wondered
what
he
was
going
to
do
it
would
seem
as
if
he
had
destroyed
all
of
his
father
affection
for
him
and
he
trembled
lest
the
old
gentleman
should
cast
him
off
everything
even
if
his
father
did
not
disown
him
he
did
not
see
how
they
could
ever
be
the
same
they
might
go
on
living
together
in
the
same
house
but
as
far
apart
from
each
other
as
strangers
this
however
did
not
seem
natural
it
was
much
more
likely
that
his
father
would
send
him
away
anywhere
out
of
his
sight
forwarding
perhaps
through
his
lawyer
or
agents
enough
money
to
keep
him
alive
the
more
vandover
thought
of
this
the
more
he
became
convinced
that
such
would
be
his
father
decision
the
old
gentleman
had
spent
the
night
over
it
time
enough
to
make
up
his
mind
and
the
fact
that
he
had
neither
spoken
to
him
nor
looked
at
him
that
morning
was
only
an
indication
of
what
vandover
was
to
expect
he
fancied
he
knew
his
father
well
enough
to
foresee
how
this
decision
would
be
carried
out
not
with
any
imprecations
or
bursts
of
rage
but
calmly
sadly
inevitably
toward
noon
his
father
came
into
the
room
and
vandover
turned
to
face
him
and
to
hear
what
he
had
to
say
as
best
he
could
he
knew
he
should
not
break
down
under
it
for
he
felt
as
though
his
misery
had
reached
its
limit
and
that
nothing
could
touch
or
affect
him
much
now
his
father
had
a
decanter
of
port
in
one
hand
and
a
glass
in
the
other
he
filled
the
glass
and
held
it
toward
vandover
saying
gently
i
think
you
had
better
take
some
of
this
you
hardly
eaten
anything
in
three
days
do
you
feel
pretty
bad
van
vandover
put
the
glass
down
and
got
upon
his
feet
all
at
once
a
great
sob
shook
him
oh
governor
he
cried
it
was
as
if
it
had
been
a
mother
or
a
dear
sister
the
prodigal
son
put
his
arms
about
his
father
neck
for
the
first
time
since
he
had
been
a
little
boy
and
clung
to
him
and
wept
as
though
his
heart
were
breaking
chapter
eight
we
will
begin
all
over
again
van
his
father
said
later
that
same
day
we
will
start
in
again
and
try
to
forget
all
this
not
as
much
as
we
but
as
much
as
we
and
live
it
down
and
from
now
on
we
try
to
do
the
thing
that
is
right
and
brave
and
good
just
try
me
sir
cried
vandover
that
was
it
begin
all
over
again
he
had
never
seen
more
clearly
than
now
that
other
life
which
it
was
possible
for
him
to
live
a
life
that
was
above
the
level
of
and
animal
pleasures
a
life
that
was
not
made
up
of
the
society
of
lost
women
or
fast
girls
but
yet
a
life
of
keen
enjoyment
whenever
he
had
been
deeply
moved
about
anything
the
power
and
desire
of
art
had
grown
big
within
him
and
he
turned
to
it
now
instinctively
and
ardently
it
was
all
the
better
half
of
him
that
was
aroused
the
better
half
that
he
had
kept
in
check
ever
since
his
college
days
the
better
half
that
could
respond
to
the
influences
of
his
father
and
of
turner
ravis
that
other
vandover
whom
he
felt
was
his
real
self
vandover
the
true
man
vandover
the
artist
not
vandover
the
the
not
vandover
the
lover
of
women
from
this
time
forward
he
was
resolved
to
give
up
the
world
that
he
had
hitherto
known
and
devote
himself
with
all
his
strength
to
his
art
in
the
first
glow
of
that
resolution
he
thought
that
he
had
never
been
happier
he
wondered
how
he
could
have
been
blind
so
long
what
was
all
that
life
worth
compared
with
the
life
of
a
great
artist
compared
even
with
a
life
of
sturdy
virile
effort
and
patient
labour
even
though
barren
of
achievement
and
then
something
very
curious
happened
the
little
picture
of
turner
ravis
that
hung
over
his
mantelpiece
caught
his
glance
looking
out
at
him
with
her
honest
eyes
and
sweet
smile
in
an
instant
he
seemed
to
love
her
as
he
had
never
imagined
he
could
love
any
one
all
that
was
best
in
him
went
out
toward
her
in
a
wave
of
immense
tenderness
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
he
could
not
tell
why
ah
he
was
not
good
enough
for
her
now
but
he
would
love
her
so
well
that
he
would
grow
better
and
between
her
and
his
good
father
and
his
art
the
better
vandover
the
real
vandover
would
grow
so
large
and
strong
within
him
that
there
should
be
no
room
for
the
other
vandover
the
vandover
of
flossie
and
of
the
imperial
the
vandover
of
the
brute
during
the
course
of
talk
that
day
between
himself
and
his
father
it
was
decided
that
vandover
should
go
away
for
a
little
while
he
was
in
a
fair
way
to
be
sick
from
worry
and
nervous
exhaustion
and
a
sea
trip
to
san
diego
and
back
seemed
to
be
what
he
stood
most
in
need
of
besides
this
his
father
told
him
it
was
inevitable
that
his
share
in
death
would
soon
be
known
in
any
case
it
would
be
better
for
him
to
be
away
from
the
city
you
take
whatever
steamer
sails
next
said
his
father
and
go
down
to
coronado
and
stay
there
as
long
as
you
like
three
weeks
anyway
stay
there
until
you
get
well
and
when
you
get
back
van
we
have
a
talk
about
paris
again
perhaps
you
would
like
to
get
away
this
winter
maybe
as
soon
as
next
month
you
think
it
over
while
you
are
away
and
when
you
want
to
go
why
we
go
over
together
van
what
do
you
think
would
you
like
to
have
your
old
governor
along
for
a
little
while
the
cast
off
the
company
docks
the
next
day
about
noon
in
the
midst
of
a
thick
cold
mist
that
was
half
rain
the
old
gentleman
came
to
see
vandover
off
the
steamer
which
seemed
gigantic
was
roped
and
cabled
to
the
piers
feeling
the
water
occasionally
with
her
screw
to
keep
the
hawsers
taut
about
the
forward
gangway
a
band
of
overworked
stevedores
were
stowing
in
the
last
of
the
cargo
aided
by
a
donkey
engine
which
every
now
and
then
broke
out
into
a
spasm
of
sputtering
coughs
at
the
passenger
gangway
a
great
crowd
was
gathered
laughing
and
exchanging
remarks
with
the
other
crowd
that
leaned
over
the
railings
of
the
decks
there
was
a
smell
of
pitch
and
bilge
in
the
air
mingled
with
the
reek
of
hot
oil
from
the
engines
about
twelve
an
odour
of
cooking
arose
and
the
steward
went
about
the
decks
drumming
upon
a
snoring
gong
for
dinner
half
an
hour
later
the
great
whistle
roared
interminably
drowning
out
the
chorus
of
that
rose
on
all
sides
long
before
it
had
ceased
the
huge
bulk
had
stirred
almost
imperceptibly
at
first
then
gathering
headway
swung
out
into
the
stream
and
headed
for
the
golden
gate
vandover
was
in
the
stern
upon
the
hurricane
deck
shaking
his
hat
toward
his
father
who
had
tied
his
handkerchief
to
his
cane
and
was
waving
it
at
him
as
he
stood
upon
an
empty
as
the
throng
of
those
who
were
left
behind
dwindled
away
one
by
one
vandover
could
see
him
standing
there
almost
the
last
of
all
and
long
after
the
figure
itself
was
lost
in
the
blur
of
the
background
he
still
saw
the
tiny
white
dot
of
the
handkerchief
moving
back
and
forth
as
if
spelling
out
a
signal
to
him
across
the
water
the
fog
drew
a
little
higher
as
they
passed
down
the
bay
to
the
left
was
the
city
swarming
upon
its
hills
a
dull
gray
mass
cut
in
parallel
furrows
by
the
streets
straggling
and
uneven
where
it
approached
the
in
the
direction
of
the
presidio
to
the
right
the
long
slope
of
tamalpais
climbed
up
and
was
lost
in
the
fog
while
directly
in
front
of
them
was
the
golden
gate
a
bleak
prospect
of
headlands
on
either
side
of
a
narrow
strip
of
yellow
frothy
water
beyond
that
the
open
pacific
a
brisk
cannonade
was
going
on
from
the
presidio
and
from
black
point
and
both
forts
were
hidden
behind
a
great
curtain
of
tumbling
white
smoke
that
rolled
up
to
mingle
with
the
fog
everybody
was
on
that
side
of
the
deck
watching
and
making
guesses
as
to
the
reason
of
it
it
was
perhaps
target
practice
ah
it
was
a
good
thing
that
the
steamer
was
not
in
line
with
the
target
perhaps
though
that
was
the
safest
place
to
be
some
one
told
about
a
derelict
that
was
anchored
as
a
target
off
the
heads
and
shot
at
for
fifteen
hours
without
being
touched
once
oh
they
were
great
gunners
at
the
presidio
but
just
the
same
the
sound
of
cannon
was
a
fine
thing
to
hear
it
excited
one
a
noisy
party
of
gentlemen
already
installed
in
the
came
out
on
deck
for
a
moment
with
their
cards
in
their
hands
and
declared
laughingly
that
the
whole
thing
was
only
a
salute
in
the
honour
by
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
vandover
began
to
see
that
for
him
the
trip
was
going
to
be
tedious
he
knew
no
one
on
board
and
had
come
away
so
hurriedly
that
he
had
neglected
to
get
himself
any
interesting
books
he
spent
an
hour
or
two
promenading
the
upper
deck
until
the
cold
wind
that
was
blowing
drove
him
to
the
where
he
tried
to
interest
himself
in
watching
some
of
the
whist
games
that
were
in
progress
it
surprised
him
that
he
could
find
occasion
to
be
bored
so
soon
after
what
had
happened
but
he
no
longer
wished
to
occupy
his
mind
by
brooding
over
anything
so
disagreeable
and
wanted
some
sort
of
amusement
to
divert
and
entertain
him
vandover
had
so
accustomed
himself
to
that
kind
of
that
he
could
not
go
long
without
it
it
had
become
a
simple
necessity
for
him
to
be
amused
and
just
now
he
thought
himself
justified
in
seeking
it
in
order
to
forget
about
ida
death
he
had
dwelt
upon
this
now
for
nearly
four
days
until
it
had
come
to
be
some
sort
of
a
formless
horror
that
it
was
necessary
to
avoid
he
could
get
little
present
enjoyment
by
looking
forward
to
the
new
life
that
he
was
going
to
begin
and
in
which
his
father
his
art
and
turner
ravis
were
to
be
the
chief
influences
the
thought
of
this
prospect
did
give
him
pleasure
but
he
had
for
so
long
a
time
fed
his
mind
upon
the
more
tangible
and
concrete
enjoyments
of
the
hour
and
minute
that
it
demanded
them
now
continually
he
sat
for
a
long
time
upon
the
slippery
leather
cushions
of
the
trying
desperately
to
become
interested
in
the
whist
game
or
gazing
awestruck
at
the
man
at
his
elbow
who
was
smoking
black
perrique
in
a
pipe
inhaling
the
smoke
and
blowing
it
out
through
his
nose
after
a
while
he
returned
to
the
deck
there
it
was
cold
and
wet
and
a
strong
wind
was
blowing
from
the
ocean
four
miles
to
the
east
an
endless
procession
of
brown
bare
hills
filed
slowly
past
under
the
fog
the
sky
was
a
dreary
brown
and
the
leagues
of
shifting
water
a
melancholy
desert
of
gray
besides
these
there
was
nothing
but
the
bleached
hills
and
the
drifting
fog
the
wind
blew
continually
passing
between
the
immense
reaches
of
sea
and
sky
with
prolonged
sighs
of
infinite
sadness
three
seagulls
followed
the
vessel
now
in
a
long
line
now
abreast
and
now
in
a
triangle
they
sailed
slowly
about
dipping
and
rising
in
the
vast
hollows
between
the
waves
turning
their
heads
constantly
from
side
to
side
vandover
went
to
the
stern
and
for
a
time
found
amusement
in
watching
the
indicator
of
the
patent
log
and
listening
for
its
bell
but
his
interest
in
this
was
soon
exhausted
and
he
returned
to
the
again
reflecting
that
this
was
only
the
first
afternoon
and
that
there
still
remained
two
days
that
somehow
had
to
be
gone
through
with
about
five
as
he
was
on
his
way
to
get
a
glass
of
seltzer
he
saw
grace
irving
the
girl
of
the
red
hat
whom
he
had
met
at
the
mechanics
fair
sitting
on
a
just
inside
of
her
stateroom
eating
a
banana
the
sight
of
her
startled
him
out
of
all
composure
for
the
minute
his
first
impulse
was
to
speak
to
her
but
he
reflected
that
he
was
done
with
all
that
now
and
that
it
was
better
for
him
to
pass
on
as
though
he
had
not
seen
her
but
as
he
came
in
front
of
her
she
looked
up
quickly
and
nodded
to
him
very
pleasantly
in
such
a
way
that
it
was
evident
she
had
already
known
he
was
on
board
it
was
impossible
for
vandover
to
ignore
her
and
though
he
did
not
stop
he
looked
back
at
her
and
smiled
as
he
took
off
his
hat
he
went
down
to
supper
in
considerable
agitation
marvelling
at
the
coincidence
that
had
brought
them
together
again
he
wondered
too
how
she
could
be
so
pleasant
to
him
now
for
as
a
matter
of
course
he
had
not
kept
the
engagement
he
had
made
with
her
at
the
fair
at
the
same
time
he
felt
that
she
must
think
him
a
great
fool
not
to
have
stopped
and
spoken
to
her
either
he
should
have
done
that
or
else
have
ignored
her
little
bow
entirely
he
was
firmly
resolved
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
her
yet
it
chafed
him
to
feel
that
she
thought
him
diffident
it
seemed
now
as
though
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
speak
to
her
if
only
for
a
minute
and
make
some
sort
of
an
excuse
by
the
time
he
had
finished
his
supper
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
do
this
and
then
to
avoid
her
for
the
rest
of
the
trip
as
he
was
leaving
the
dining
saloon
he
met
her
coming
down
the
stairs
alone
dressed
very
prettily
in
a
checked
travelling
ulster
with
a
gray
velvet
collar
and
a
little
fore
and
aft
cap
to
match
he
stopped
her
and
made
his
excuses
she
did
not
say
much
in
reply
and
seemed
a
little
offended
so
that
vandover
could
not
refrain
from
adding
that
he
was
very
glad
to
see
her
on
board
ah
you
do
seem
as
if
you
were
very
she
said
putting
out
her
chin
at
him
prettily
and
passing
on
it
was
an
awkward
and
embarrassing
little
scene
and
vandover
was
glad
that
it
was
over
but
the
thing
had
been
done
now
he
had
managed
to
show
the
girl
that
he
did
not
wish
to
keep
up
the
acquaintance
begun
at
the
fair
and
from
now
on
she
would
keep
out
of
his
way
he
took
a
few
turns
on
the
upper
deck
smoking
his
pipe
walking
about
fast
while
his
dinner
digested
the
sun
went
down
behind
the
black
horizon
in
an
immense
nebula
of
mist
the
sea
turned
from
gray
to
dull
green
and
then
to
a
lifeless
brown
and
the
lights
began
to
glow
at
her
quarters
and
at
her
masthead
in
her
stern
the
screw
drummed
and
threshed
monotonously
a
puff
of
warm
air
reeking
with
the
smell
of
hot
oil
came
from
the
engine
hatch
and
in
an
instant
vandover
saw
again
the
curved
roof
of
the
immense
depot
the
passengers
on
the
platform
staring
curiously
at
the
group
around
the
invalid
chair
the
repair
gang
in
spotted
blue
overalls
and
the
huge
white
cat
dozing
on
an
empty
baggage
truck
the
wind
freshened
and
he
returned
to
the
to
get
warm
the
same
game
of
whist
was
going
on
and
the
man
with
the
perrique
tobacco
had
filled
another
pipe
and
continued
to
blow
the
smoke
through
his
nose
after
a
while
vandover
went
back
to
the
main
deck
and
wandered
aft
where
he
stood
a
long
time
looking
over
the
stern
interested
in
watching
the
receding
water
it
was
dark
by
this
time
the
wind
had
increased
and
had
blown
the
fog
to
landward
and
the
ocean
had
changed
to
a
deep
blue
the
blue
of
the
sky
at
night
here
and
there
a
wave
broke
leaving
a
line
of
white
on
the
sea
like
the
trail
of
a
falling
star
across
the
heavens
while
the
white
haze
of
the
steamer
wake
wandered
vaguely
across
the
intense
blue
like
the
milky
way
across
the
zenith
vandover
was
horribly
bored
there
seemed
to
be
absolutely
nothing
to
amuse
him
unless
indeed
he
should
decide
to
renew
his
acquaintance
with
grace
irving
but
this
was
out
of
the
question
now
for
he
knew
what
it
would
lead
to
even
if
he
should
yield
to
the
temptation
he
did
not
see
how
he
could
take
any
great
pleasure
in
that
sort
of
thing
again
after
what
had
happened
of
all
the
consequences
of
what
he
had
done
the
one
which
had
come
to
afflict
him
the
most
poignantly
was
that
his
enjoyment
of
life
was
spoiled
at
first
he
had
thought
that
he
never
could
take
pleasure
in
anything
again
so
long
as
he
should
live
that
his
good
times
were
gone
but
as
his
pliable
character
rearranged
itself
to
suit
the
new
environment
he
began
to
see
that
there
would
come
a
time
when
he
would
grow
accustomed
to
ida
death
and
when
his
grief
would
lose
its
sharpness
he
had
even
commenced
to
look
forward
to
this
time
and
to
long
for
it
as
a
sort
of
respite
and
relief
he
believed
at
first
that
it
would
not
be
for
a
great
many
years
but
even
so
soon
after
the
suicide
as
this
he
saw
with
a
little
thrill
of
comfort
that
it
would
be
but
a
matter
of
months
at
the
same
time
vandover
was
surprised
and
even
troubled
at
the
ease
with
which
he
was
recovering
from
the
first
shock
he
wondered
at
himself
because
he
knew
he
had
been
sincere
in
his
talk
with
his
father
vandover
was
not
given
to
but
now
for
a
minute
he
was
wondering
if
this
reaction
were
due
to
his
youth
his
good
health
and
his
good
spirits
or
whether
there
was
something
wrong
with
him
however
he
dismissed
these
thoughts
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
though
freeing
himself
from
some
disagreeable
burden
ah
he
was
no
worse
than
the
average
one
could
get
accustomed
to
almost
anything
it
was
only
in
the
books
that
people
had
their
lives
ruined
and
to
brood
over
such
things
was
unnatural
and
morbid
ah
what
a
dreadful
thing
to
become
morbid
he
could
not
bring
ida
back
or
mitigate
what
he
had
done
or
be
any
more
sorry
for
it
by
making
himself
miserable
well
then
only
he
would
let
that
sort
of
thing
alone
after
this
the
lesson
had
been
too
terrible
he
would
try
and
enjoy
himself
again
only
it
should
be
in
other
ways
later
in
the
evening
about
nine
when
nearly
all
the
passengers
were
in
bed
and
vandover
was
leaning
over
the
side
of
the
boat
finishing
his
pipe
before
turning
in
himself
grace
irving
came
out
of
her
stateroom
and
sat
down
at
a
little
distance
from
him
looking
out
over
the
water
humming
a
little
song
she
and
vandover
were
the
only
people
to
be
seen
on
the
deserted
promenade
vandover
saw
her
without
moving
only
closing
his
teeth
tighter
on
his
pipe
it
was
evident
that
grace
expected
him
to
speak
to
her
and
had
given
him
a
chance
for
an
admirable
little
for
a
moment
vandover
heart
knocked
at
his
throat
he
drew
his
breath
once
or
twice
sharply
through
his
nose
in
an
instant
all
the
old
evil
instincts
were
back
again
urging
and
clamouring
never
so
strong
never
so
insistent
but
vandover
set
his
face
against
them
honestly
recalling
his
resolution
telling
himself
that
he
was
done
with
that
life
as
he
had
said
the
lesson
had
been
too
terrible
he
turned
about
resolutely
and
walked
slowly
away
from
her
the
girl
looked
after
him
a
moment
surprised
and
then
called
out
oh
mr
vandover
vandover
paused
a
moment
looking
back
where
are
you
going
she
went
on
did
you
see
me
here
do
you
want
to
come
and
talk
to
me
no
answered
vandover
smiling
trying
to
be
as
polite
as
was
possible
no
i
do
then
he
took
a
sudden
resolution
and
added
gravely
i
do
want
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you
in
his
stateroom
as
he
sat
on
the
edge
of
his
berth
winding
his
watch
before
going
to
bed
he
thought
over
what
he
had
said
that
was
a
mean
way
to
talk
to
a
girl
he
told
himself
but
he
added
it
the
only
thing
to
do
i
simply
could
start
in
again
after
all
that
happened
oh
yes
that
was
the
right
thing
to
do
he
felt
a
glow
of
for
his
firmness
and
his
decision
a
pride
in
the
unexpected
strength
the
fine
moral
rigour
that
he
had
developed
at
the
critical
moment
he
turn
sharp
around
when
he
wanted
to
after
all
ah
yes
that
was
the
only
thing
to
do
if
one
was
to
begin
all
over
again
and
live
down
what
had
happened
he
wished
that
the
governor
might
know
how
well
he
had
acted
chapter
nine
vandover
stayed
for
two
weeks
at
coronado
beach
and
managed
to
pass
the
time
very
pleasantly
he
was
fortunate
enough
to
find
a
party
at
the
hotel
whom
he
knew
very
well
in
the
morning
they
bathed
or
sailed
on
the
bay
and
in
the
afternoon
rode
out
with
a
pack
of
greyhounds
and
coursed
on
the
lower
end
of
the
island
vandover
good
spirits
began
to
come
back
to
him
his
appetite
returned
his
nerves
steadied
themselves
he
slept
eight
hours
every
night
but
for
all
that
he
did
not
think
that
things
were
the
same
with
him
he
said
to
himself
that
he
was
a
changed
man
that
he
was
older
more
serious
during
this
time
he
received
several
letters
from
his
father
which
he
answered
very
promptly
in
the
course
of
their
correspondence
it
was
arranged
that
they
should
both
leave
for
europe
on
the
of
that
month
and
that
consequently
vandover
should
return
to
the
city
not
later
than
the
fifteenth
vandover
was
having
such
a
good
time
however
that
he
stayed
over
the
regular
steamer
in
order
to
go
upon
a
moonlight
picnic
down
on
the
beach
the
next
afternoon
he
took
passage
for
san
francisco
on
a
boat
this
homeward
passage
turned
out
to
be
one
long
misery
for
vandover
he
had
never
been
upon
a
boat
before
and
had
never
imagined
that
anything
could
be
so
horribly
uncomfortable
or
disagreeable
the
was
overcrowded
improperly
ballasted
and
rolled
continually
the
table
was
bad
the
accommodations
inadequate
the
passengers
hopelessly
uncongenial
cold
and
foggy
weather
accompanied
the
boat
continually
the
same
endless
procession
of
bleached
hills
still
filed
past
under
the
mist
going
now
in
the
opposite
direction
and
the
same
interminable
game
of
whist
was
played
in
the
only
with
greasier
cards
amidst
the
acrid
smoke
of
tobacco
at
supper
the
first
day
out
a
little
jew
who
sat
next
to
vandover
and
who
invariably
wore
a
plush
with
tried
to
sell
him
two
flawed
and
yellow
diamonds
the
evening
after
leaving
port
hartford
the
ran
into
dirty
weather
it
was
not
stormy
simply
rough
disagreeable
the
wind
and
sea
directly
ahead
half
an
hour
after
supper
vandover
began
to
be
sick
for
a
long
time
he
sat
on
the
slippery
leather
cushions
in
the
nasty
sucking
limes
drinking
seltzer
and
trying
to
be
interested
in
the
card
games
he
dozed
a
little
and
awoke
feeling
wretched
covered
with
a
cold
sweat
racked
by
a
pain
in
the
back
of
his
head
and
tortured
by
an
abominable
nausea
he
groped
his
way
out
upon
the
swaying
gusty
deck
descended
to
his
cabin
and
went
to
bed
the
had
booked
more
passengers
than
could
be
accommodated
the
steward
being
obliged
to
make
up
beds
on
the
floor
of
the
dining
saloon
and
even
upon
some
of
the
tables
vandover
had
not
been
able
to
get
a
stateroom
and
so
had
put
up
with
a
bunk
in
the
common
cabin
at
the
stern
of
the
vessel
about
two
in
the
morning
he
woke
up
in
this
place
frightfully
sick
at
the
stomach
and
wretched
in
body
and
mind
he
had
an
upper
bunk
and
for
a
long
time
he
lay
on
his
back
rolling
about
with
the
rolling
of
the
steamer
vaguely
staring
straight
above
him
at
the
roof
of
the
cabin
hardly
a
above
his
face
the
roof
was
iron
painted
with
a
white
paint
very
thick
and
shiny
and
was
studded
with
innumerable
and
enormous
nuts
by
and
by
for
no
particular
reason
he
rose
on
his
elbow
and
leaning
over
the
side
of
his
berth
looked
about
him
the
light
streaming
from
two
ship
lanterns
showed
the
cabin
long
and
narrow
there
were
two
cramped
passageways
on
either
side
of
which
the
tiers
of
bunks
mere
open
racks
filled
with
bedding
rose
to
the
roof
those
occupied
by
women
hung
with
spotted
calico
the
cabin
was
two
decks
below
the
open
air
and
every
berth
was
occupied
the
only
ventilation
being
through
the
door
the
air
was
foul
with
the
stench
of
bilge
the
reek
of
the
untrimmed
lamps
the
exhalation
of
so
many
breaths
and
the
close
stale
smell
of
warm
bedding
a
vague
murmur
rose
in
the
air
the
sound
of
deep
breathing
the
moving
of
restless
bodies
between
the
coarse
sheets
the
momentary
noise
of
the
scratching
of
blunt
a
subdued
cough
the
moan
of
a
sleeping
child
all
the
while
the
shaft
of
the
screw
seemingly
close
beneath
the
floor
pounded
and
rumbled
without
a
moment
stop
immediately
underneath
vandover
two
men
saloonkeepers
awoke
and
lit
their
cigars
and
began
a
long
discussion
on
the
question
of
license
two
or
three
bunks
distant
a
woman
a
salvation
army
lassie
one
of
a
large
party
of
salvationists
who
were
on
board
began
to
cough
violently
choking
for
breath
across
the
aisle
the
little
jew
of
the
plush
with
snored
monotonously
in
alternate
keys
one
a
guttural
bass
the
other
a
rasping
treble
the
was
rolling
worse
than
ever
now
up
and
down
now
from
side
to
side
and
now
with
long
forward
lurches
that
combined
the
other
two
motions
during
one
of
these
latter
the
little
jew
was
half
awakened
he
stopped
snoring
leaving
an
abrupt
silence
in
the
air
then
vandover
could
hear
him
threshing
about
uneasily
still
half
asleep
he
began
to
mutter
and
swear
dat
it
i
woult
if
i
were
you
righd
dhere
soh
ah
geep
it
oop
you
damnt
ole
tub
yust
the
continued
pitching
the
foul
air
and
the
bitter
smoke
from
the
saloonkeepers
cigars
became
more
than
vandover
could
stand
his
stomach
turned
at
every
instant
he
gagged
and
choked
he
suddenly
made
up
his
mind
that
he
could
stand
it
no
longer
and
determined
to
go
on
deck
preferring
to
walk
the
night
out
rather
than
spend
it
in
the
cabin
he
drew
on
his
shoes
without
lacing
them
and
dressed
himself
hurriedly
omitting
his
collar
and
scarf
he
put
his
hat
on
his
tumbled
hair
swung
into
his
overcoat
and
wrapping
his
around
him
started
up
toward
the
deck
on
the
stairs
he
was
seized
with
such
a
nausea
that
he
could
hardly
keep
from
vomiting
where
he
stood
but
he
rushed
out
upon
the
lower
deck
gaining
the
rail
with
a
swimming
head
he
sank
back
upon
an
iron
capstan
with
a
groan
weak
and
trembling
his
eyes
full
of
tears
a
bursting
feeling
in
his
head
he
was
utterly
miserable
it
was
about
two
in
the
morning
and
a
cold
raw
wind
was
whistling
through
the
cordage
and
flinging
the
steamer
smoke
down
upon
the
decks
and
upon
the
water
like
a
great
veil
of
crêpe
a
sickly
was
spread
out
between
the
sea
and
the
heavens
by
its
means
he
could
barely
distinguish
great
livid
blotches
of
fog
or
cloud
whirling
across
the
black
sky
and
the
unnumbered
multitude
of
waves
rushing
past
plunging
and
rising
like
a
vast
herd
of
black
horses
galloping
on
with
shaking
white
manes
low
in
the
northeast
horizon
lay
a
long
pale
blur
of
light
against
which
the
bow
of
the
steamer
inky
black
rose
and
fell
and
heaved
and
sank
incessantly
to
the
landward
side
and
very
near
at
hand
so
near
that
he
could
hear
the
surf
at
their
feet
the
long
procession
of
hills
continually
defiled
vague
and
formless
masses
between
the
sea
and
sky
the
wind
the
noise
of
the
waves
rushing
past
the
roll
of
the
breakers
and
the
groaning
of
the
cordage
all
blended
together
and
filled
the
air
with
a
prolonged
minor
note
lamentable
beyond
words
the
atmosphere
was
cold
and
damp
the
spray
flying
like
icy
bullets
the
sombre
light
that
hung
over
the
sea
reflected
itself
in
long
blurred
streaks
upon
the
wet
decks
and
slippery
iron
rods
here
and
there
about
the
rigging
a
tremulous
ball
of
orange
haze
showed
where
the
ship
lanterns
were
swung
directly
under
him
in
the
stern
the
screw
snarled
incessantly
in
a
vortex
of
boiling
water
that
forever
swirled
away
and
was
lost
in
the
darkness
from
time
to
time
the
indicator
of
the
patent
log
just
beside
him
rang
its
tiny
bell
vandover
drew
his
rug
about
him
and
went
up
to
the
main
deck
dragging
his
shoelaces
after
him
the
wind
was
stronger
here
but
he
bent
his
head
against
it
and
went
on
toward
the
for
the
idea
had
occurred
to
him
that
he
could
shut
himself
in
there
and
pass
the
rest
of
the
night
upon
the
cushions
anything
was
better
than
returning
to
the
cabin
downstairs
the
deck
was
jerked
away
from
beneath
his
feet
and
he
was
hurled
forward
many
times
his
own
length
against
a
companionway
breaking
his
thumb
as
he
fell
a
second
shock
threw
him
down
again
as
he
rose
everything
about
him
shook
and
danced
like
glassware
upon
a
jarred
table
then
the
whole
ship
rose
under
his
feet
as
no
wave
had
ever
lifted
it
and
fell
again
not
into
yielding
water
but
upon
something
that
drove
through
its
sides
as
if
they
had
been
paper
a
deafening
crashing
noise
split
the
mournful
howl
of
the
wind
and
far
underneath
him
vandover
heard
a
rapid
series
of
blows
a
dreadful
rumbling
and
pounding
that
thrilled
and
quivered
through
all
the
vessel
framework
up
to
her
very
on
all
fours
upon
the
deck
holding
to
a
cleat
with
one
hand
he
braced
himself
watching
and
listening
his
senses
all
alive
his
muscles
tense
in
the
direction
of
the
he
heard
the
furious
ringing
of
a
bell
the
screw
stopped
the
wallowed
helplessly
in
the
trough
of
the
sea
vandover
very
first
impulse
was
a
wild
desire
of
saving
himself
he
had
not
the
least
thought
for
any
one
else
every
soul
on
board
might
drown
so
only
he
should
be
saved
it
was
the
primitive
animal
instinct
the
blind
adherence
to
the
first
great
law
an
impulse
that
in
this
first
moment
of
excitement
could
not
be
resisted
he
ran
forward
and
snatched
a
from
the
pile
that
was
stored
beneath
the
bridge
as
he
was
fastening
it
about
him
the
passengers
began
to
pour
out
upon
the
deck
from
their
staterooms
from
the
companionways
and
from
the
dining
saloon
in
an
instant
the
deck
was
crowded
men
and
women
ran
about
in
all
directions
pushing
and
elbowing
each
other
calling
shrilly
over
one
another
heads
near
to
vandover
a
woman
clothed
only
in
her
clung
to
the
arm
of
a
man
crying
again
and
again
for
a
certain
august
she
wrung
her
hands
in
her
excitement
at
times
the
man
shouted
august
in
a
quavering
bass
voice
august
here
we
are
over
oh
where
gussie
wailed
the
woman
here
here
i
am
another
voice
answered
at
length
here
i
am
i
all
right
oh
exclaimed
the
woman
with
a
sob
of
relief
here
gussie
now
let
all
keep
together
whatever
happens
all
about
the
decks
just
such
scenes
were
going
on
most
of
the
women
wore
only
their
or
their
hair
tumbling
down
and
blowing
about
their
cheeks
their
bare
feet
slipping
and
sliding
on
the
heaving
wet
decks
the
men
were
in
shirt
and
drawers
standing
in
the
centre
of
their
family
groups
silent
excited
very
watchful
others
of
them
ran
about
searching
for
shouting
hoarsely
talking
to
themselves
speaking
all
their
thoughts
aloud
but
there
was
no
panic
there
was
excitement
confusion
bewilderment
but
no
excess
of
fear
no
unreasoning
terror
deaf
blind
utterly
reckless
all
at
once
a
man
parted
the
crowd
with
shoulders
and
elbows
passing
along
the
deck
with
great
strides
it
was
the
captain
the
next
instant
vandover
saw
him
on
the
bridge
hatless
without
his
vest
or
his
coat
just
as
he
had
sprung
from
his
berth
from
time
to
time
he
shouted
his
orders
leaning
over
the
rail
gesturing
with
his
arm
the
crew
ran
about
carrying
out
his
directions
jostling
the
men
out
of
the
way
knocking
over
women
and
children
speaking
to
no
one
intent
only
upon
their
work
in
a
few
moments
the
deck
steward
and
one
of
the
officers
appeared
amid
the
crowd
of
passengers
they
were
very
calm
and
at
every
instant
shouted
there
is
no
danger
every
one
go
back
to
his
berth
clear
the
deck
please
no
danger
gentlemen
everybody
be
quiet
go
back
to
your
berths
the
steward
even
came
up
to
vandover
and
pulled
at
the
straps
of
his
exclaiming
take
this
off
there
is
no
danger
you
only
exciting
the
other
passengers
come
on
take
it
off
and
go
back
to
your
berth
vandover
obeyed
him
slowly
loosening
the
buckles
looking
around
him
bewildered
but
still
holding
the
preserver
in
his
hands
best
of
all
however
was
the
example
of
a
huge
old
fellow
wearing
the
cap
and
clothes
of
a
boatswain
mate
of
a
united
states
battleship
he
seemed
to
dominate
the
excited
throng
in
a
moment
going
about
from
group
to
group
quieting
them
all
spreading
a
feeling
of
confidence
and
courage
throughout
the
whole
ship
he
was
an
inspiration
to
vandover
who
began
to
be
ashamed
of
having
yielded
to
the
first
selfish
instinct
of
preservation
just
as
the
boatswain
mate
was
offering
his
flask
to
the
woman
whom
vandover
had
heard
calling
for
august
the
lurched
heavily
once
or
twice
and
then
slowly
listed
to
the
port
side
going
over
farther
and
farther
every
instant
vandover
heard
a
renewed
rumbling
and
smashing
noise
far
beneath
him
and
in
some
way
knew
that
the
cargo
was
shifting
instead
of
righting
herself
the
ship
began
to
heave
over
more
and
more
the
whole
sea
on
the
port
side
seemed
to
rise
up
to
meet
the
rail
under
vandover
feet
the
incline
of
the
deck
grew
steeper
and
steeper
all
at
once
his
excitement
came
back
upon
him
with
the
sharpness
of
a
blow
and
he
caught
at
the
brass
grating
of
a
skylight
exclaiming
by
god
we
going
the
women
screamed
with
terror
one
heard
the
men
shouting
look
out
hold
on
catch
hold
there
an
old
man
wearing
only
a
gray
flannel
shirt
lost
his
footing
he
fell
and
rolled
over
and
over
down
the
deck
stupidly
inertly
without
making
the
slightest
effort
to
save
himself
without
uttering
the
least
cry
he
brought
up
suddenly
against
the
rail
with
a
great
jar
the
shock
of
his
soft
withered
body
against
the
hard
wood
sounding
like
the
sodden
impact
of
a
bundle
of
damp
clothes
there
was
a
cry
they
thought
him
killed
vandover
had
seen
his
head
gashed
against
a
sharp
angle
of
iron
but
he
jumped
up
with
sudden
agility
clambering
up
the
slope
of
the
deck
with
the
strength
and
rapidity
of
an
acrobat
there
had
been
a
great
rush
to
the
other
side
of
the
ship
a
wild
scrambling
up
the
steep
deck
over
skylights
and
between
masts
and
ventilators
people
clung
to
anything
to
cleats
to
steamer
chairs
to
the
brass
railings
to
the
person
who
stood
next
to
them
they
no
longer
listened
to
the
protestations
of
the
brave
boatswain
mate
that
last
long
roll
had
terrified
them
the
sense
of
a
great
catastrophe
began
to
spread
and
widen
all
about
like
the
rising
of
some
fearful
invisible
mist
had
happened
what
was
to
become
of
them
while
vandover
clung
to
the
starboard
rail
rolling
his
eyes
wildly
trying
to
control
himself
again
a
young
man
a
waiter
in
the
dining
saloon
rushed
up
to
him
from
out
of
the
crowd
holding
out
his
hand
it
all
up
he
shouted
vandover
grasped
his
extended
palm
shaking
hands
with
him
fervently
without
knowing
why
the
two
looked
straight
into
each
other
eyes
their
hands
gripped
close
then
the
waiter
turned
away
and
dropping
on
his
knees
began
to
pray
silently
to
himself
vandover
saw
a
great
many
others
praying
there
was
even
a
large
group
gathered
about
the
band
of
salvationists
trying
to
raise
a
hymn
every
now
and
then
their
voices
could
be
heard
singing
all
out
of
tune
a
medley
of
discords
at
one
time
vandover
caught
sight
of
the
little
jew
of
the
plush
cap
with
the
he
was
grovelling
upon
the
deck
huddling
a
small
black
satchel
to
his
breast
without
a
moment
pause
he
screamed
god
mercy
god
mercy
the
sight
revolted
vandover
and
in
a
great
measure
helped
to
calm
him
in
a
few
moments
he
had
himself
in
hand
again
cool
and
resolved
not
to
act
like
a
fool
before
the
others
but
to
help
them
if
he
could
near
to
him
a
salvation
army
lassie
was
down
upon
her
knees
trying
to
cord
up
a
huge
bundle
wrapped
in
here
exclaimed
vandover
coming
up
to
her
let
me
help
i
tie
this
for
you
you
put
on
he
took
the
wet
stiff
ropes
from
between
her
fingers
and
held
the
toward
her
but
she
refused
it
no
she
cried
enthusiastically
i
going
to
be
saved
anyhow
i
going
to
drown
jesus
is
watching
over
me
oh
she
suddenly
exclaimed
with
a
burst
of
fervor
jesus
is
going
to
save
me
i
i
going
to
be
saved
i
feel
it
i
feel
it
and
she
struck
her
palm
on
the
breast
of
the
man
red
jersey
she
was
wearing
well
i
wish
could
have
such
a
confidence
answered
vandover
sincerely
envying
the
plain
little
woman
under
the
ugly
blue
bonnet
she
seemed
as
if
inspired
her
face
glowing
only
all
she
told
him
it
is
too
late
for
you
now
ah
she
went
on
smiling
ah
you
do
know
what
it
is
in
a
time
like
this
what
a
comfort
what
a
support
oh
she
cried
breaking
off
and
starting
to
her
feet
that
man
is
going
to
jump
it
was
the
boatswain
mate
the
hero
who
had
filled
all
the
passengers
with
his
own
coolness
and
courage
who
had
been
vandover
inspiration
some
strange
reaction
seemed
to
have
seized
upon
him
of
a
sudden
he
rushed
to
the
rail
the
starboard
rail
that
was
heaved
so
high
out
of
the
water
stood
upon
it
for
a
moment
and
then
with
a
great
shout
jumped
over
the
side
his
folly
was
as
infectious
as
his
courage
four
more
men
followed
him
three
going
over
all
at
the
same
time
and
a
fourth
a
little
later
hanging
an
instant
upon
the
outside
of
the
rail
then
dropping
down
feet
first
disappearing
with
a
great
splash
that
made
itself
heard
in
the
great
silence
that
had
suddenly
fallen
upon
the
throng
every
one
had
seen
what
had
happened
a
thrill
of
fear
and
apprehension
passed
over
them
all
like
a
cold
breath
they
were
silent
struck
dumb
feeling
the
presence
of
death
close
by
suddenly
a
long
flash
of
yellow
upon
the
bridge
made
a
momentary
streak
on
the
darkness
and
there
was
the
report
of
a
gun
a
minute
later
it
was
fired
again
and
alternating
with
it
the
whistle
began
to
roar
like
a
hoarse
shout
for
help
between
these
sounds
could
be
heard
the
renewed
clamour
upon
the
decks
the
shouting
the
screaming
and
the
rush
of
many
feet
the
little
children
clung
about
the
knees
of
their
mothers
shrieking
and
wailing
monotonously
oh
oh
rolling
their
eyes
fearfully
behind
them
but
many
of
the
children
even
some
of
the
older
passengers
were
absolutely
silent
dazed
stupefied
with
terror
and
excitement
their
eyes
vague
and
distended
looking
slowly
about
them
scarcely
daring
to
move
a
limb
meanwhile
the
was
settling
forward
and
already
the
spray
was
beginning
to
fly
over
the
decks
little
by
little
the
terror
increased
people
threw
themselves
down
upon
the
deck
rising
up
again
their
arms
raised
to
heaven
praying
aloud
screaming
the
same
things
over
and
over
again
the
salvationists
tried
to
raise
another
hymn
but
the
sound
of
their
voices
was
drowned
out
by
the
tumult
the
roaring
of
the
whistle
the
barking
of
the
minute
guns
the
straining
and
snapping
of
the
cordage
and
the
sound
of
waves
drawing
closer
and
closer
prone
upon
the
deck
his
arms
still
clasped
about
his
black
satchel
the
little
jew
of
the
plush
cap
went
into
some
kind
of
fit
his
eyes
rolled
back
his
teeth
grinding
upon
each
other
vandover
turned
from
him
in
disgust
then
he
looked
around
and
above
him
drawing
a
long
breath
saying
aloud
to
himself
it
looks
as
though
it
were
the
end
well
all
at
once
vandover
knew
that
the
water
had
reached
the
boilers
there
came
a
noise
of
hissing
deafening
stunning
white
billows
of
steam
poured
up
over
the
deck
it
was
no
longer
the
no
longer
a
thing
of
wood
and
iron
but
some
strange
huge
living
creature
that
was
dying
there
under
his
feet
some
enormous
brute
that
was
plunging
and
writhing
in
its
last
agony
its
belly
ripped
open
by
a
hidden
enemy
that
struck
from
beneath
its
entrails
torn
out
its
going
from
it
in
great
gasps
of
steam
suddenly
its
bellow
collapsed
the
great
bulk
was
sinking
lower
the
enemy
was
in
its
very
vitals
the
great
hoarse
roar
dwindled
to
a
long
death
rattle
then
to
a
guttural
rasp
all
at
once
it
ceased
the
brute
was
dead
the
was
a
wreck
almost
at
the
moment
he
heard
an
order
shouted
twice
from
the
bridge
where
he
could
see
the
shadowy
figures
of
the
captain
and
officers
moving
about
through
the
clouds
of
steam
and
smoke
and
mist
immediately
there
followed
the
shrill
piping
of
the
boatswain
whistle
one
of
the
officers
the
first
engineer
and
some
half
dozen
of
the
crew
came
dashing
through
the
crowd
and
there
was
a
great
shout
of
the
boats
the
boats
the
crowd
broke
up
rushing
here
and
there
about
the
ship
reforming
again
in
smaller
bands
by
the
boats
and
vandover
followed
the
first
engineer
running
forward
toward
one
of
the
boats
in
the
bow
come
on
he
shouted
to
the
little
salvationist
lassie
pausing
a
moment
to
help
her
with
her
heavy
bundle
come
on
they
going
to
lower
the
boats
she
started
up
to
follow
him
and
the
boom
of
the
foremast
which
the
accident
had
in
some
way
loosened
swung
across
the
deck
at
the
same
moment
vandover
was
already
out
of
its
path
but
it
struck
the
young
woman
squarely
across
the
back
she
dropped
in
a
heap
upon
the
deck
then
her
body
slowly
straightened
out
stiff
and
rigid
her
eyes
rapidly
opened
and
shut
and
a
great
puff
of
white
froth
slowly
started
from
her
mouth
vandover
ran
forward
and
lifted
her
up
but
her
back
was
broken
she
was
already
dead
he
rose
to
his
feet
exclaiming
to
himself
but
she
was
so
sure
she
she
was
going
to
be
saved
then
suddenly
fell
silent
again
gazing
wonderingly
at
the
body
disturbed
very
thoughtful
when
vandover
finally
reached
the
lifeboat
he
found
a
great
crowd
gathered
there
three
people
were
already
in
the
boat
itself
the
first
engineer
who
commanded
that
boat
and
three
of
the
crew
stood
by
the
falls
preparing
to
cast
off
just
below
on
the
deck
of
the
stood
two
sailors
keeping
the
crowd
in
order
continually
shouting
women
and
children
first
as
the
women
passed
their
children
forward
the
sailors
lifted
them
into
the
boats
some
shrieking
others
silent
and
stupid
as
if
stunned
then
the
women
were
helped
up
the
men
vandover
among
them
climbing
in
afterward
the
davits
were
turned
out
and
the
boat
was
swung
clear
of
the
ship
side
vandover
looked
out
and
below
him
and
then
made
an
involuntary
movement
to
regain
the
ship
deck
far
below
him
or
so
at
least
it
seemed
were
mountains
of
tumbling
green
water
huge
relentless
irresistible
rushing
on
by
thousands
to
shatter
themselves
with
dreadful
force
against
the
ship
side
it
seemed
simple
madness
to
attempt
to
launch
the
boat
even
the
sinking
wreck
would
be
safer
than
this
chance
vandover
was
terrified
again
deserted
by
all
his
calmness
and
the
sailors
standing
in
the
bow
and
the
stern
let
out
the
ropes
little
by
little
the
vast
black
hulk
of
the
ship
began
to
loom
up
above
them
all
higher
and
higher
and
to
their
eyes
the
lifeboat
began
to
grow
smaller
and
smaller
more
and
more
frail
more
and
more
pitiful
all
at
once
it
struck
the
water
with
a
crash
in
an
instant
it
was
tossed
up
again
in
the
air
heaving
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
was
carried
in
and
dashed
up
against
the
ship
all
the
oars
on
that
side
snapping
in
an
instant
it
was
a
fearful
moment
the
little
boat
was
unmanageable
in
an
instant
leaping
and
plunging
among
the
waves
like
a
terrified
horse
banged
and
battered
between
the
heaving
water
and
the
hull
of
the
steamer
itself
vandover
believed
that
all
was
over
he
partially
rose
from
his
seat
preparing
to
jump
before
the
boat
should
swamp
there
was
an
interval
of
shouting
and
confusion
the
first
engineer
and
the
crew
leaning
over
the
sides
fending
off
the
boat
with
the
stumps
of
the
oars
and
with
long
boathooks
some
oars
were
shipped
to
the
other
side
to
take
the
place
of
the
broken
ones
and
a
score
of
hands
tugging
at
them
the
boat
was
at
length
pulled
away
out
of
danger
the
lifeboat
had
been
built
to
hold
people
more
than
forty
had
crowded
into
it
and
it
needed
all
prudence
and
care
to
keep
it
afloat
in
the
heavy
seas
that
were
running
the
sailors
and
two
of
the
passengers
were
at
the
oars
while
the
first
engineer
took
command
standing
in
the
stern
at
the
he
was
dressed
in
a
suit
of
oilskins
a
strapped
under
his
arms
he
wore
no
hat
and
at
every
gust
his
drenched
hair
and
beard
whipped
across
his
face
just
as
the
boat
was
pulling
away
from
the
wreck
vandover
and
the
others
saw
the
little
jew
of
the
plush
cap
with
the
standing
upon
the
rail
of
the
steamer
holding
to
a
stanchion
he
believed
that
he
had
been
abandoned
and
screamed
after
them
stretching
out
his
hands
the
engineer
turned
and
saw
him
but
shook
his
head
give
way
there
he
commanded
the
men
there
no
more
room
the
jew
flung
his
satchel
from
him
and
jumped
for
a
moment
he
disappeared
then
suddenly
came
up
on
the
crest
of
a
wave
quite
close
to
them
gasping
and
beating
his
hands
the
water
running
out
of
his
mouth
and
his
plush
cap
glossy
with
wet
all
awry
and
twisted
so
that
one
hung
over
his
eye
like
a
shade
in
another
moment
he
had
grasped
one
of
the
every
one
was
watching
and
there
was
a
cry
draw
him
in
but
the
engineer
refused
it
too
late
he
shouted
partly
to
the
jew
and
partly
to
the
boat
one
more
and
we
are
swamped
let
go
there
but
you
ca
let
him
drown
cried
vandover
and
the
others
who
sat
near
oh
take
him
in
anyhow
we
must
risk
it
risk
hell
thundered
the
engineer
look
here
you
he
cried
to
vandover
and
the
rest
i
in
command
here
and
am
responsible
for
the
lives
of
all
of
you
it
a
matter
of
his
life
or
ours
one
life
or
forty
one
more
and
we
are
swamped
let
go
there
yes
yes
cried
some
it
too
late
there
no
more
room
but
others
still
protested
it
too
horrible
do
let
him
drown
take
him
in
they
threw
him
their
and
the
stumps
of
the
broken
oars
but
the
jew
saw
nothing
heard
nothing
clinging
to
the
panting
and
stupid
his
eyes
wide
and
staring
shake
him
off
commanded
the
engineer
the
sailor
at
the
oar
jerked
and
twisted
it
but
the
jew
still
held
on
silent
and
breathing
hard
vandover
glanced
at
the
fearfully
overloaded
boat
and
saw
the
necessity
of
it
and
held
his
peace
watching
the
thing
that
was
being
done
the
sailor
still
attempted
to
tear
the
oar
from
the
jew
grip
but
the
jew
held
on
panting
almost
exhausted
they
could
hear
his
breathing
in
the
boat
oh
do
he
gasped
rolling
his
eyes
unship
that
oar
and
throw
it
overboard
shouted
the
engineer
better
not
sir
answered
the
sailor
extra
oars
all
broken
the
jew
was
hindering
the
progress
of
the
boat
and
at
every
moment
it
threatened
to
turn
broad
on
to
the
seas
god
damn
you
let
go
there
shouted
the
engineer
himself
wrenching
and
twisting
at
the
oar
let
go
or
i
shoot
but
the
jew
deaf
and
stupid
drew
himself
along
the
oar
hand
over
hand
and
in
a
moment
had
caught
hold
of
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
it
careened
on
the
instant
there
was
a
great
cry
push
him
off
swamping
push
him
off
and
one
of
the
women
cried
to
the
mate
let
my
little
girls
drown
sir
push
him
away
save
my
little
girls
let
him
drown
it
was
the
animal
in
them
all
that
had
come
to
the
surface
in
an
instant
the
primal
instinct
of
the
brute
striving
for
its
life
and
for
the
life
of
its
young
the
engineer
exasperated
caught
up
the
stump
of
one
of
the
broken
oars
and
beat
on
the
jew
hands
where
they
were
gripped
whitely
upon
the
boat
rim
shouting
let
go
let
go
but
as
soon
as
the
jew
relaxed
one
hand
he
caught
again
with
the
other
he
uttered
no
cry
but
his
face
as
it
came
and
went
over
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
was
white
and
writhing
when
he
was
at
length
beaten
from
the
boat
he
caught
again
at
the
oar
it
was
drawn
in
and
the
engineer
clubbed
his
head
and
arms
and
hands
till
the
water
near
by
grew
red
the
little
jew
clung
to
the
end
of
the
oar
like
a
cat
writhing
and
grunting
his
mouth
open
and
his
eyes
fixed
and
staring
when
his
hands
were
gone
he
tried
to
embrace
the
oar
with
his
arms
he
slid
off
in
the
hollow
of
a
wave
his
body
turned
over
twice
and
then
he
sank
his
head
thrown
back
his
eyes
still
open
and
staring
and
a
silver
chain
of
bubbles
escaping
from
his
mouth
give
way
men
said
the
engineer
oh
god
exclaimed
vandover
turning
away
and
vomiting
over
the
side
a
little
while
later
some
one
on
the
bow
of
the
boat
called
to
the
engineer
asking
why
it
was
they
were
not
heading
for
the
shore
the
engineer
did
not
answer
but
vandover
in
some
way
understood
that
it
was
too
dangerous
to
attempt
to
run
the
breakers
in
such
heavy
weather
and
that
they
must
keep
in
the
open
holding
the
boat
head
on
to
the
seas
until
either
the
wind
fell
or
they
were
picked
up
by
some
other
vessel
it
was
still
very
dark
and
seen
under
the
night
from
the
little
boat
the
ocean
and
the
sky
seemed
immense
and
terrible
the
great
waves
grew
out
of
the
obscurity
ahead
of
them
rushing
down
upon
the
boat
big
swelling
silent
their
crests
occasionally
hissing
and
breaking
into
irruptions
of
cold
white
froth
as
one
of
them
would
draw
near
the
boat
would
rise
upon
it
as
though
it
would
never
stop
would
hang
a
moment
upon
its
summit
and
then
topple
into
the
black
gulf
that
followed
sending
the
bitter
icy
spray
high
into
the
air
the
wind
blew
steadily
suddenly
toward
three
it
began
to
rain
vandover
the
engineer
all
the
five
sailors
and
two
of
the
passengers
were
clothed
the
rest
of
the
passengers
were
little
better
than
naked
here
and
there
a
man
had
snatched
a
blanket
from
his
berth
and
one
or
two
of
them
were
wearing
their
trousers
but
the
rest
were
clothed
for
the
most
part
only
with
their
shirts
and
drawers
there
were
eighteen
women
and
five
little
girls
in
the
boat
the
little
girls
were
well
looked
after
two
were
wrapped
in
vandover
and
a
couple
of
men
had
put
their
coats
around
the
third
but
there
were
not
wraps
enough
to
go
around
among
the
women
by
far
the
larger
part
of
them
were
covered
only
by
their
or
their
it
was
abominably
cold
the
rain
fell
continually
and
the
wind
blew
in
long
gusts
piercing
cutting
every
plunge
of
the
boat
threw
icy
bullets
of
spray
into
the
air
which
the
wind
caught
up
and
flung
down
broad
upon
the
boat
sometimes
even
a
huge
wave
would
break
just
upon
their
quarter
and
then
great
torrents
of
bitter
freezing
water
would
fall
over
them
in
a
deluge
leaving
a
sediment
of
salt
that
cracked
the
skin
the
women
were
huddled
upon
the
bottom
of
the
boat
near
the
waist
where
they
had
been
placed
for
greater
safety
they
were
fouled
with
the
muddy
water
that
gathered
there
their
long
hair
dishevelled
dripping
with
sleet
clinging
to
their
wet
cheeks
and
throats
their
bodies
showing
pink
with
cold
through
their
thin
soaked
coverings
their
limbs
racked
with
long
incessant
shudderings
a
wretched
group
miserable
beyond
words
one
of
them
close
by
vandover
feet
he
noticed
particularly
had
but
a
single
garment
to
cover
her
she
was
drenched
through
and
through
her
bare
feet
were
blue
with
the
cold
her
head
was
thrown
back
her
eyes
closed
she
was
silent
except
when
an
unusual
gust
of
wind
whipped
the
rain
and
spray
across
her
body
like
the
long
fine
lash
of
a
whip
then
with
every
breath
she
moaned
drawing
in
her
breath
between
her
teeth
with
a
little
whistling
gasp
too
weak
too
exhausted
too
nearly
unconscious
to
attempt
to
shield
herself
in
any
way
vandover
could
do
nothing
he
had
almost
stripped
himself
to
help
clothe
the
others
nothing
more
could
be
done
the
suffering
had
to
go
on
and
he
began
to
wonder
how
human
beings
could
endure
such
stress
and
yet
live
but
vandover
himself
suffered
too
keenly
to
take
much
thought
for
the
sufferings
of
the
others
while
besides
that
anguish
which
he
shared
with
the
whole
boat
the
pain
in
his
broken
thumb
gnawed
incessantly
like
a
rat
from
time
to
time
he
stared
listlessly
about
him
looking
at
the
dark
sky
the
tumbling
ocean
and
the
crowded
groups
in
the
plunging
rolling
lifeboat
there
was
nothing
picturesque
about
it
all
nothing
heroic
it
was
unlike
any
pictures
he
had
seen
of
lifeboat
rescues
unlike
anything
he
had
ever
imagined
it
was
all
sordid
miserable
and
the
sight
of
the
women
dirty
sodden
unkempt
stirred
him
rather
to
disgust
than
to
pity
at
last
the
dawn
came
and
grew
white
over
a
world
of
tumbling
green
billows
and
scudding
wrack
some
three
miles
distant
seen
only
when
the
boat
topped
a
higher
wave
the
same
procession
of
bleached
hills
moved
gradually
to
the
south
under
the
fog
their
feet
covered
by
the
white
line
of
the
surf
not
far
behind
in
the
wake
of
the
boat
the
stern
of
the
rose
out
of
a
ring
of
white
foam
the
waves
breaking
over
her
as
if
she
had
been
there
for
ages
the
screw
writhing
its
flanges
into
the
air
like
some
enormous
starfish
already
fastened
upon
the
hulk
one
of
the
other
boats
could
be
seen
now
and
then
between
them
and
the
shore
a
momentary
dot
of
black
on
the
vast
blur
of
green
and
gray
there
was
no
conversation
the
men
relieved
each
other
at
the
oars
or
bailed
out
the
water
with
their
caps
and
hands
scarcely
interchanging
a
word
the
only
utterance
was
an
occasional
moaning
from
among
the
women
and
children
there
was
nothing
to
eat
long
since
the
two
whisky
flasks
had
been
exhausted
the
rain
fell
steadily
into
the
sea
with
a
prolonged
rippling
noise
vandover
was
leaning
upon
the
gunwale
of
the
boat
his
head
buried
in
his
arms
when
suddenly
he
raised
himself
and
asked
of
the
man
who
sat
next
to
him
what
was
the
matter
last
night
what
caused
the
accident
the
other
shook
his
head
wearily
turning
away
again
however
the
engineer
answered
we
could
carry
coal
enough
to
keep
up
the
right
pressure
of
steam
and
drifted
in
upon
a
reef
i
said
once
before
that
it
would
happen
some
time
about
an
hour
later
vandover
dropped
off
to
sleep
in
spite
of
the
cold
the
wet
and
the
torment
in
his
thumb
he
dozed
and
woke
and
dozed
again
all
through
the
morning
about
noon
he
was
awakened
by
a
more
violent
rolling
of
the
boat
the
sound
of
voices
and
a
stir
among
the
other
passengers
it
was
still
raining
the
boat
was
no
longer
cutting
the
waves
with
her
nose
but
was
being
rowed
seaward
flank
on
a
sailor
stood
in
the
bow
holding
a
coil
of
rope
close
in
and
seen
over
the
tops
of
the
waves
were
the
shaking
and
slatting
sails
of
a
lying
to
one
of
the
sails
bore
an
enormous
number
six
vandover
slept
all
that
day
and
the
night
following
rolled
in
hot
blankets
the
next
morning
he
awoke
with
a
strange
sense
of
unreality
and
of
having
dropped
a
day
somewhere
as
he
lay
in
his
stuffy
little
bunk
between
decks
and
felt
the
rolling
of
the
under
him
he
still
fancied
himself
upon
the
he
felt
the
pain
in
his
bandaged
thumb
and
wondered
how
it
came
there
then
his
fall
on
the
deck
came
back
to
him
the
wreck
of
the
steamer
the
excitement
on
board
the
reports
of
the
rifle
fired
as
a
minute
gun
the
clouds
of
steam
that
smelt
of
a
great
laundry
and
the
drowning
of
the
little
jew
of
the
plush
cap
with
the
he
shuddered
and
grew
sick
again
for
a
minute
telling
himself
that
he
would
never
forget
that
scene
such
of
the
passengers
as
could
get
about
breakfasted
as
best
they
could
in
the
cabin
with
the
boatkeeper
and
four
of
the
pilots
here
they
were
informed
as
to
what
was
to
be
done
with
them
the
schooner
would
not
go
in
for
two
weeks
and
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
keep
the
castaways
on
board
for
that
length
of
time
however
at
that
moment
the
pilots
were
cruising
in
the
neighbourhood
on
the
lookout
for
two
cape
horners
that
were
expected
to
be
up
at
any
moment
it
was
decided
that
when
the
first
of
these
should
be
met
with
the
party
should
be
transferred
an
hour
after
they
had
been
picked
up
the
wind
had
begun
to
freshen
by
noon
of
the
second
day
it
had
come
on
to
blow
half
a
gale
one
could
hope
only
for
the
best
as
regarded
the
rest
of
the
boats
and
rafts
not
another
sign
of
the
wreck
was
seen
by
the
schooner
the
castaways
filled
the
little
schooner
to
overflowing
hindering
her
management
and
getting
in
the
way
at
every
step
the
pilot
crew
hustled
them
about
without
ceremony
and
after
dinner
one
had
to
intervene
to
prevent
a
fight
between
one
of
them
and
a
sailor
from
the
over
the
question
of
a
broken
pipe
the
women
of
the
kept
in
their
berths
continually
rolled
in
hot
blankets
dosed
with
steaming
whisky
punches
in
the
afternoon
however
vandover
saw
two
of
them
in
the
lee
of
the
house
attempting
to
dry
their
hair
one
of
them
was
the
woman
he
had
particularly
noticed
in
the
lifeboat
clad
in
a
and
he
wondered
vaguely
where
the
dress
had
come
from
she
now
was
wearing
about
three
of
the
afternoon
of
the
following
day
vandover
was
sitting
on
the
deck
near
the
stern
fastening
on
his
shoes
with
a
length
of
tarred
rope
the
laces
which
he
had
left
trailing
having
long
before
broken
and
pulled
out
by
that
time
the
wind
was
blowing
squally
out
of
the
northeast
the
schooner
was
put
under
try
sails
a
mitten
with
the
thumb
brailed
up
as
he
heard
the
boatkeeper
call
it
this
latter
was
at
the
wheel
for
a
moment
but
in
a
little
while
he
called
up
a
young
man
dressed
in
a
suit
of
oilskins
and
a
pea
jacket
and
gave
him
the
charge
for
a
long
time
vandover
watched
the
boy
turning
the
spokes
back
and
forth
his
eyes
alternating
between
the
binocle
and
the
horizon
in
the
evening
about
ten
the
lookout
in
the
crow
nest
sang
out
smoke
oh
sounding
upon
his
fish
horn
the
boatkeeper
ran
aft
and
lit
a
huge
calcium
flare
holding
it
so
as
to
illuminate
the
big
number
on
the
mainsail
suddenly
about
a
quarter
of
a
mile
off
their
a
couple
of
rockets
left
a
long
trail
of
yellow
against
the
night
it
was
the
cape
horner
and
presently
vandover
made
out
her
lights
two
glowing
spots
moving
upon
the
darkness
like
the
eyes
of
some
nocturnal
in
a
few
minutes
she
showed
a
blue
light
on
the
bridge
she
wanted
a
pilot
the
schooner
approached
and
was
laid
to
and
the
towering
mass
of
the
great
tramp
began
to
be
dimly
seen
through
the
darkness
there
was
little
confusion
in
making
the
transfer
of
the
castaways
most
of
them
seemed
still
benumbed
with
their
recent
terrible
exposure
they
docilely
allowed
themselves
to
be
pushed
into
the
pilot
tender
and
again
endured
the
experience
of
being
lowered
to
the
shifting
waves
below
silently
like
frightened
sheep
they
stood
up
in
turn
in
the
rocking
tender
and
allowed
the
life
preserver
to
be
fitted
about
their
shoulders
to
protect
them
from
the
bite
of
the
rope
noose
beneath
their
arms
there
followed
a
sickening
upward
whirl
between
sea
and
sky
and
then
the
comforting
grasp
of
many
welcoming
hands
from
the
deck
above
by
three
in
the
morning
the
transfer
had
been
made
vandover
boarded
the
cape
horner
in
company
with
the
pilot
and
the
rest
and
reached
san
francisco
late
on
the
next
day
which
happened
to
be
a
sunday
chapter
ten
about
ten
vandover
went
ashore
in
the
ship
yawl
and
landed
in
the
city
on
a
literally
perfect
day
in
early
november
it
seemed
many
years
since
he
had
been
there
the
drizzly
morning
upon
which
the
had
cast
off
was
already
too
long
ago
to
be
remembered
the
city
itself
as
he
walked
up
market
street
toward
kearney
seemed
to
have
taken
on
a
strange
appearance
it
was
sunday
the
downtown
streets
were
deserted
except
for
the
and
an
occasional
newsboy
the
stores
were
closed
and
in
their
vestibules
one
saw
the
peddlers
who
were
never
there
on
venders
of
canes
and
peddlers
of
glue
with
heavy
weights
attached
to
mended
china
plates
vandover
had
had
no
breakfast
and
was
conscious
of
feeling
desperately
hungry
he
determined
to
breakfast
downtown
as
he
would
arrive
home
too
late
for
one
meal
and
too
early
for
the
other
almost
all
of
his
money
had
been
lost
with
the
he
found
he
had
but
a
dollar
left
he
would
have
preferred
breakfasting
at
the
grillroom
but
concluded
he
was
too
shabby
in
appearance
and
he
knew
he
would
get
more
for
his
money
at
the
imperial
it
was
absolutely
quiet
in
the
imperial
at
the
hour
when
he
arrived
the
single
bartender
was
reading
a
paper
and
in
the
passage
between
the
private
rooms
a
chinese
with
a
clean
napkin
wound
around
his
head
was
polishing
the
brass
and
woodwork
in
the
passage
he
met
toby
the
waiter
just
going
off
night
duty
without
his
usual
apron
or
white
coat
dressed
very
carefully
wearing
a
brown
felt
hat
why
how
do
you
do
mr
vandover
exclaimed
toby
have
seen
you
round
here
for
some
time
vandover
was
about
to
answer
when
the
other
interrupted
well
what
happened
to
look
as
though
you
been
drawn
through
hell
backward
and
beaten
with
a
cat
in
fact
vandover
appearance
was
extraordinary
his
hat
was
torn
and
broken
and
his
clothes
stained
with
tar
and
dirt
shrunken
and
wrinkled
by
his
shoes
were
fastened
with
bits
of
tarred
rope
he
was
wearing
a
red
flannel
shirt
with
bone
buttons
which
the
boatkeeper
on
the
pilot
boat
had
given
him
tied
at
the
neck
with
a
purple
handkerchief
of
pongee
silk
his
hair
was
long
and
a
growth
of
beard
was
upon
his
lip
and
cheeks
that
a
fact
he
answered
grimly
i
do
look
queer
i
was
in
a
wreck
down
the
coast
he
added
hastily
the
exclaimed
toby
that
a
fact
the
papers
have
been
full
of
it
that
so
you
were
one
of
the
survivors
the
survivors
echoed
vandover
with
wondering
curiosity
tell
me
you
know
i
have
heard
a
word
yet
were
there
many
lives
lost
he
marvelled
at
the
strangeness
of
the
situation
that
this
bar
waiter
should
know
more
of
the
wreck
than
he
himself
who
had
been
upon
it
you
bet
there
were
answered
toby
altogether
one
boat
capsized

kelly
son
of
that
fellow
that
runs

crystal
grotto

of
his
travelling
salesmen

little
jew

diamond

he
jumped
overboard
and

vandover
with
a
sharp
gesture
i
saw
him

it
was
sickening
were
you
in
that
boat
exclaimed
toby
well
wait
till
i
tell
you
the
authorities
here
are
right
after
that
first
engineer
with
a
sharp
stick
and
some
of
the
passengers
too
for
not
taking
him
in
a
woman
in
one
of
the
other
boats
saw
it
all
and
gave
the
whole
thing
away
a
thing
like
that
is
regular
murder
you
know
vandover
shut
his
teeth
against
answering
and
after
a
little
toby
went
on
willing
to
talk
you
know
we
got
a
new
man
for
the
down
here
now
george
is
here
any
more
no
he
going
to
start
a
roadhouse
out
on
the
almshouse
drive
in
a
few
months
swell
place
you
know
i
have
him
send
you
cards
for
the
opening
vandover
ordered
oysters
an
omelette
and
a
pint
of
claret
from
the
new
waiter
who
did
the
and
ate
and
drank
the
meal
the
like
of
which
he
had
not
tasted
since
leaving
coronado
with
delicious
enjoyment
he
delayed
over
it
long
taking
a
great
pleasure
in
satisfying
the
demands
of
the
animal
in
him
the
wine
made
him
heavy
warm
stupid
he
felt
calm
soothed
and
perfectly
contented
and
had
to
struggle
against
a
desire
to
go
to
sleep
where
he
was
the
atmosphere
of
the
imperial
was
warm
and
there
was
a
tepid
languor
in
the
air
as
of
the
traces
of
many
past
debauches
a
stale
odour
of
sweetened
whisky
and
of
musk
after
the
roughness
and
hardships
of
the
last
week
he
felt
a
pleasant
sense
of
quiet
of
relaxation
of
enervation
he
even
began
to
wish
that
flossie
would
come
in
this
however
made
him
rouse
himself
he
shook
himself
and
started
home
paying
his
carfare
with
his
last
nickel
he
sat
on
the
outside
of
the
car
wondering
if
any
one
he
knew
would
see
him
half
hoping
that
such
a
thing
might
happen
realizing
the
dramatic
interest
that
would
centre
about
him
now
in
his
present
condition
as
a
survivor
of
a
wreck
the
idea
soon
attracted
him
immensely
and
he
began
to
look
out
for
any
possible
acquaintance
as
the
car
began
to
climb
over
nob
hill
at
the
crossing
of
polk
street
he
saw
ida
wade
mother
in
deep
mourning
standing
near
a
grocery
store
holding
a
little
pink
parcel
it
was
like
a
blow
between
the
eyes
vandover
caught
his
breath
and
started
violently
feeling
again
for
an
instant
the
cold
grip
of
the
hysterical
terror
that
had
so
nearly
overcome
him
on
the
morning
after
ida
death
it
slowly
relaxed
however
and
by
the
time
he
had
reached
the
house
on
california
street
he
was
almost
himself
again
it
was
about
church
time
when
vandover
arrived
at
home
once
more
there
was
a
sunday
quiet
in
the
air
the
bells
were
ringing
and
here
and
there
family
groups
on
their
way
to
church
the
children
walking
in
front
very
sedate
in
their
best
clothes
carrying
the
carefully
by
special
privilege
the
butler
was
working
in
the
garden
as
he
sometimes
did
of
a
sunday
morning
pottering
about
a
certain
bed
of
and
it
was
the
housekeeper
who
answered
his
ring
she
recognized
him
with
a
prolonged
exclamation
raising
her
hands
to
heaven
and
is
it
you
vandover
sir
ah
how
we
been
upset
about
you
and
all
and
it
glad
to
see
you
back
again
your
father
will
be
oh
such
times
as
we
had
when
we
heard
about
the
wreck
and
knowing
you
were
on
it
yes
sir
your
father
well
though
he
was
main
poorly
yesterday
morning
but
he
better
now
you
find
him
in
the
now
sir
vandover
pushed
open
the
door
of
the
quietly
his
father
was
sitting
unoccupied
in
the
huge
leather
chair
before
the
fireplace
he
was
dead
and
must
have
died
some
considerable
time
before
as
he
was
already
cold
he
could
have
suffered
no
pain
hardly
a
muscle
had
moved
and
his
attitude
was
quite
natural
the
legs
crossed
the
right
hand
holding
the
morning
paper
however
as
soon
as
vandover
touched
the
body
it
collapsed
and
slid
down
into
a
heap
in
the
depth
of
the
chair
the
jaw
dropping
open
the
head
rolling
sidewise
upon
his
shoulder
vandover
ran
out
into
the
hall
waving
his
arms
shouting
for
the
servants
oh
why
did
you
tell
me
he
cried
to
the
housekeeper
why
did
you
let
me
find
him
so
when
did
he
die
the
housekeeper
was
distraught
she
could
believe
it
only
a
little
while
ago
he
had
called
her
to
say
there
were
no
more
matches
in
the
little
brass
matchsafe
she
began
to
utter
long
cries
and
lamentations
like
a
hen
in
distress
raising
her
hands
to
heaven
all
at
once
they
heard
some
one
rushing
up
the
stairs
it
was
the
butler
in
his
and
his
enormous
apron
of
ticking
still
carrying
his
trowel
in
his
hand
he
was
bewildered
his
eyes
protruding
while
all
about
him
he
spread
the
smell
of
fresh
earth
at
every
instant
he
exclaimed
what
what
what
the
matter
oh
my
dear
old
governor
and
all
alone
cried
vandover
through
shut
teeth
oh
oh
the
good
god
exclaimed
the
housekeeper
crossing
herself
and
rolling
her
eyes
and
him
asking
for
matches
in
the
little
brass
box
only
a
minute
since
oh
the
good
kind
master
suddenly
vandover
rushed
down
the
stairs
and
through
the
front
hall
snatching
his
hat
from
the
hatrack
as
he
passed
he
ran
to
call
the
family
doctor
who
lived
some
two
blocks
below
on
the
same
street
he
caught
him
just
as
he
was
getting
into
the
with
his
family
bound
for
church
vandover
and
the
physician
rode
back
together
in
the
the
two
gray
horses
going
up
the
steep
hill
at
a
trot
the
doctor
was
dressed
for
church
he
wore
red
gloves
with
thick
white
seams
a
spray
of
in
his
lapel
i
afraid
we
can
do
nothing
he
said
warningly
it
your
old
enemy
i
suppose
this
was
it
was
sure
to
happen
sooner
or
later
any
sudden
shock
you
know
vandover
scarcely
listened
holding
the
door
of
the
open
with
one
hand
ready
to
jump
out
beating
the
other
hand
upon
his
knee
go
back
and
take
the
rest
of
them
to
church
now
said
the
doctor
to
his
coachman
when
the
stopped
in
front
of
vandover
house
the
whole
house
was
in
the
greatest
agitation
all
the
rest
of
the
day
the
curtains
were
drawn
the
door
bell
rang
incessantly
strange
faces
passed
the
windows
and
the
noise
of
strange
footsteps
continually
mounted
and
descended
the
staircase
the
hours
for
meals
were
all
deranged
the
table
stood
ready
all
day
long
and
one
ate
when
there
was
a
chance
the
telephone
was
in
constant
use
and
at
every
moment
messenger
boys
came
and
went
people
spoke
in
low
tones
walking
on
tiptoe
the
florist
wagon
drove
to
the
door
again
and
again
and
the
house
began
to
smell
of
tuberoses
reporters
came
waiting
patiently
for
interviews
sitting
on
the
leather
chairs
in
the
or
writing
rapidly
on
a
corner
of
the
the
cloth
pushed
back
the
undertaker
assistants
went
about
in
their
working
very
hard
and
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
undertaker
himself
tied
the
crêpe
to
the
bell
handle
little
by
little
a
subdued
excitement
spread
throughout
the
vicinity
the
neighbours
appeared
at
their
windows
looking
down
into
the
street
watching
everything
that
went
on
it
was
a
veritable
event
a
matter
of
comment
and
interest
for
the
whole
block
women
found
excuses
to
call
on
each
other
talking
over
what
had
happened
as
they
sat
near
their
parlour
windows
shaking
their
heads
at
each
other
peering
out
between
the
lace
curtains
the
people
on
the
and
the
pedestrians
looked
again
and
again
at
the
crêpe
on
the
bell
handle
and
the
curtained
windows
craning
their
necks
backward
when
they
had
passed
the
neighbours
children
collected
in
little
groups
on
the
sidewalk
near
the
house
looking
and
pointing
drawn
close
together
talking
in
low
tones
at
last
even
a
policeman
appeared
walking
deliberately
casting
the
shadow
of
his
huge
stomach
upon
the
fence
that
was
about
the
vacant
lot
he
frowned
upon
the
children
ordering
them
away
but
suddenly
he
discovered
an
acquaintance
the
driver
of
an
that
had
just
driven
up
with
an
enormous
anchor
of
violets
he
paused
exclaiming
why
hello
connors
why
hello
mister
brodhead
then
a
long
conversation
was
begun
the
policeman
standing
on
the
curbstone
one
foot
resting
upon
the
hub
of
a
wheel
the
expressman
leaning
forward
his
elbows
on
his
knees
twirling
his
whip
between
his
hands
the
expressman
told
some
sort
of
story
pointing
with
his
elbow
toward
the
house
but
the
other
was
incredulous
gravely
shaking
his
head
putting
his
chin
in
the
air
and
closing
his
eyes
inside
the
house
itself
there
was
a
hushed
and
subdued
bustling
that
centred
about
a
particular
room
the
undertaker
assistants
and
the
barber
called
in
low
voices
through
the
halls
for
basins
of
water
and
towels
there
was
a
search
for
the
old
gentleman
best
clothes
and
his
clean
linen
bureau
drawers
were
opened
and
shut
closet
doors
softly
closed
relatives
and
friends
called
and
departed
or
stayed
to
help
a
vague
murmur
arose
a
mingled
sound
of
whispers
and
light
the
rustle
of
silks
and
the
noise
of
stifled
weeping
and
then
at
last
silence
night
solitude
a
single
burning
and
vandover
was
left
alone
the
suddenness
of
the
thing
had
stunned
and
dizzied
him
and
he
had
gone
through
with
all
the
various
affairs
of
the
day
wondering
at
his
calmness
and
fortitude
toward
eleven
however
after
the
suppressed
excitement
of
the
last
hours
as
he
was
going
to
bed
the
sense
of
his
grief
and
loss
came
upon
him
all
of
a
sudden
with
their
real
force
for
the
first
time
and
he
threw
himself
upon
the
bed
face
downward
weeping
and
groaning
during
the
rest
of
the
night
pictures
of
his
father
returned
to
him
as
he
had
seen
him
upon
different
occasions
particularly
three
such
pictures
came
and
went
through
his
mind
in
one
the
old
gentleman
stood
in
that
very
room
with
the
decanter
in
his
hand
asking
him
kindly
if
he
felt
very
bad
in
another
he
was
on
the
pier
with
his
handkerchief
tied
to
his
cane
waving
it
after
vandover
as
though
spelling
out
a
signal
to
him
across
the
water
but
in
a
third
he
was
in
the
fallen
into
the
leather
chair
his
arm
resting
on
the
table
and
his
head
bowed
upon
it
after
the
funeral
which
took
place
from
the
house
vandover
drove
back
alone
in
the
hired
carriage
to
his
home
he
would
have
paid
the
driver
but
the
other
told
him
that
the
undertaker
looked
out
for
that
vandover
watched
him
a
moment
as
he
started
his
horses
downhill
the
brake
as
it
scraped
against
the
tire
making
a
noise
like
the
yelping
of
a
dog
then
he
turned
and
faced
the
house
it
was
near
four
in
the
afternoon
and
everything
about
the
house
was
very
quiet
all
the
curtains
were
down
except
in
one
of
the
rooms
upstairs
the
butler
had
already
opened
these
windows
and
was
airing
the
room
vandover
could
hear
him
moving
about
sweeping
up
rearranging
the
furniture
making
up
the
bed
again
in
front
of
him
between
the
and
the
front
door
one
or
two
smilax
leaves
were
still
fallen
and
a
tuberose
already
yellow
behind
him
in
the
street
he
had
already
noticed
the
marks
of
the
wheels
of
the
hearse
where
it
had
backed
up
to
the
curb
the
crêpe
was
still
on
the
bell
handle
vandover
did
not
know
whether
it
had
been
forgotten
or
whether
it
was
proper
to
leave
it
there
longer
at
any
rate
he
took
it
off
and
carried
it
into
the
house
with
him
his
father
hat
a
stiff
brown
derby
hat
flat
on
the
top
hung
on
the
hatrack
this
had
always
been
a
sign
to
vandover
that
his
father
was
at
home
the
sight
was
so
familiar
so
natural
that
the
same
idea
occurred
to
him
now
involuntarily
and
for
an
instant
it
was
as
though
he
had
dreamed
of
his
father
death
he
even
wondered
what
was
this
terrible
grief
that
had
overwhelmed
him
and
thought
that
he
must
go
and
tell
his
father
about
it
he
took
the
hat
in
his
hands
turning
it
about
tenderly
catching
the
faint
odour
of
the
old
gentleman
hair
oil
that
hung
about
it
it
all
brought
back
his
father
to
him
as
no
picture
ever
could
he
could
almost
the
kind
old
face
underneath
the
broad
curl
of
the
brim
his
grief
came
over
him
again
keener
than
ever
and
he
put
his
arms
clumsily
about
the
old
hat
weeping
and
whispering
to
himself
oh
my
poor
dear
old
dad
i
never
going
to
see
you
again
never
never
oh
my
dear
kind
old
governor
he
took
the
hat
up
to
his
room
with
him
putting
it
carefully
away
then
he
sat
down
before
the
window
that
overlooked
the
little
garden
in
the
rear
of
the
house
looking
out
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
chapter
eleven
the
following
days
as
they
began
to
pass
were
miserable
vandover
had
never
known
until
now
how
much
he
loved
his
father
how
large
a
place
he
had
filled
in
his
life
he
felt
horribly
alone
now
and
a
veritable
feminine
weakness
overcame
him
a
crying
need
to
be
loved
as
his
father
had
loved
him
and
also
to
love
some
one
as
he
himself
had
loved
his
father
worst
of
all
however
was
his
loneliness
he
could
think
of
no
one
who
cared
in
the
least
for
him
the
very
thought
of
turner
ravis
or
young
haight
wrought
in
him
an
expression
of
scorn
he
was
sure
that
he
was
nothing
to
them
though
they
were
the
ones
whom
he
considered
his
best
friends
another
cause
of
misery
was
the
fact
that
his
father
death
in
leaving
him
alone
had
also
thrown
him
upon
his
own
resources
now
he
would
have
to
shoulder
responsibilities
which
hitherto
his
father
had
assumed
and
decide
questions
which
until
now
his
father
had
answered
however
he
felt
that
his
father
death
had
sobered
him
as
nothing
else
not
even
ida
suicide
had
done
the
time
was
come
at
length
for
him
to
take
life
seriously
he
would
settle
down
now
to
work
at
his
art
he
would
go
to
paris
as
his
father
had
wished
and
devote
himself
earnestly
to
painting
yes
the
time
was
come
for
him
to
steady
himself
and
give
over
the
vicious
life
into
which
he
had
been
drifting
but
it
was
not
long
before
vandover
had
become
accustomed
to
his
father
death
and
had
again
rearranged
himself
to
suit
the
new
environment
which
it
had
occasioned
he
wondered
at
himself
because
of
the
quickness
with
which
he
had
recovered
from
this
grief
just
as
before
he
had
marvelled
at
the
ease
with
which
he
had
forgotten
death
could
it
be
true
then
that
nothing
affected
him
very
deeply
was
his
nature
shallow
however
he
was
wrong
in
this
respect
his
nature
was
not
shallow
it
had
merely
become
deteriorated
two
days
after
his
father
death
vandover
went
into
the
old
room
to
get
a
certain
chair
which
had
been
moved
there
from
his
own
room
during
the
confusion
of
the
funeral
and
which
pending
the
arrival
of
the
trestles
had
been
used
to
support
the
coffin
as
he
was
carrying
it
back
his
eye
fell
upon
a
little
heap
of
objects
carefully
set
down
upon
the
bureau
they
were
the
contents
of
the
old
gentleman
pockets
that
the
undertaker
had
removed
when
the
body
was
dressed
for
burial
vandover
turned
them
over
sadly
interested
in
them
there
was
the
watch
some
old
business
letters
and
envelopes
covered
with
memoranda
his
a
couple
of
cigars
a
a
small
amount
of
change
his
and
one
or
two
tablets
of
vandover
thrust
the
pen
and
the
knife
into
his
own
pocket
the
letters
and
change
he
laid
away
in
his
father
desk
but
the
cigars
and
the
tablets
of
gum
together
with
the
crumpled
that
he
found
on
another
part
of
the
he
put
into
the
old
gentleman
hat
which
he
had
hidden
on
the
top
shelf
of
his
clothes
closet
the
watch
he
hung
upon
a
little
brass
thermometer
that
always
stood
on
his
centre
table
he
even
wound
up
the
watch
with
the
resolve
never
to
let
it
run
down
so
long
as
he
should
live
the
keys
however
disturbed
him
and
he
kept
changing
them
from
one
hand
to
the
other
looking
at
them
very
thoughtfully
they
suggested
to
him
the
inquiry
as
to
whether
or
no
his
father
had
made
a
will
and
how
much
money
he
vandover
could
now
command
one
of
the
keys
was
a
long
brass
key
vandover
knew
that
this
unlocked
a
little
iron
box
that
from
time
out
of
mind
had
been
screwed
upon
the
lower
shelf
of
the
clothes
closet
in
his
father
room
it
was
in
this
box
that
the
old
gentleman
kept
his
ready
money
and
a
few
important
papers
for
a
long
time
vandover
stood
undecided
changing
the
keys
about
from
one
hand
to
the
other
hesitating
before
opening
this
iron
box
he
could
not
tell
why
by
and
by
however
he
went
softly
into
his
father
room
and
into
the
clothes
closet
near
the
head
of
the
bed
holding
the
key
toward
the
lock
he
paused
listening
it
was
impossible
to
rid
his
mind
of
the
idea
that
he
was
doing
something
criminal
he
shook
himself
smiling
at
the
fancy
assuring
himself
of
the
honesty
of
the
thing
yet
opening
the
box
stealthily
holding
the
key
firmly
in
order
that
it
might
not
spring
back
with
a
loud
click
looking
over
his
shoulder
the
while
and
breathing
short
through
his
nose
the
first
thing
that
he
saw
inside
was
a
loaded
revolver
the
sudden
view
of
which
sent
a
little
qualm
through
the
pit
of
his
stomach
he
took
it
out
gingerly
holding
it
at
arm
length
throwing
open
the
cylinder
and
spilling
out
the
cartridges
on
the
bed
very
careful
to
let
none
of
them
fall
on
the
floor
lest
they
should
explode
next
he
drew
out
the
familiar
little
canvas
sack
in
it
were
the
coin
that
used
to
be
good
for
the
masses
behind
that
was
about
thirty
dollars
in
two
rolls
and
last
of
all
in
an
old
oblong
tin
a
great
bundle
of
papers
a
list
of
these
papers
was
pasted
on
one
end
of
the
box
they
comprised
deeds
titles
insurance
policies
tax
receipts
mortgages
and
all
the
papers
relating
to
the
property
besides
these
there
was
the
will
he
took
out
this
box
laying
it
on
the
shelf
beside
him
he
was
closing
the
small
iron
safe
again
very
quietly
when
all
at
once
before
he
could
think
of
what
he
was
doing
he
ran
his
hand
into
the
mouth
of
the
canvas
sack
furtively
slyly
snatched
one
of
the
heavy
round
coins
and
thrust
it
into
his
vest
pocket
looking
all
about
him
listening
intently
saying
to
himself
with
a
nervous
laugh
well
is
it
mine
anyway
in
spite
of
himself
he
could
not
help
feeling
a
joy
in
the
possession
of
this
money
as
if
of
some
dug
up
on
an
abandoned
shore
he
even
began
to
plan
vaguely
how
he
should
spend
it
however
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
open
any
of
the
papers
but
sent
them
instead
to
a
lawyer
whom
he
knew
his
father
had
often
consulted
a
few
days
later
he
received
a
typewritten
letter
asking
him
to
call
at
his
earliest
convenience
it
was
at
his
residence
and
not
at
his
office
that
vandover
saw
the
lawyer
as
the
latter
was
not
well
at
the
time
and
kept
to
his
bed
however
he
was
not
so
sick
but
that
his
doctor
allowed
him
to
transact
at
least
some
of
his
business
vandover
found
him
in
his
room
a
huge
apartment
one
side
entirely
taken
up
by
filled
with
works
of
fiction
the
walls
were
covered
with
rough
paper
forming
an
admirable
background
to
small
plaster
casts
of
assyrian
and
large
photogravures
of
renaissance
portraits
underneath
an
enormous
table
in
the
centre
of
the
room
were
green
cloth
bags
filled
apparently
with
books
padlocked
tin
chests
and
green
pasteboard
the
lawyer
was
sitting
up
in
bed
wearing
his
and
occasionally
drinking
hot
water
from
a
glass
he
was
a
thin
small
man
with
a
very
round
head
and
a
small
pointed
beard
how
do
you
do
mr
vandover
he
said
very
pleasantly
as
vandover
passed
by
the
servant
holding
open
the
door
and
came
in
how
do
you
do
mr
field
answered
vandover
shaking
his
hand
well
i
sorry
to
see
you
like
this
yes
answered
the
lawyer
i
i
have
trouble
with
my
digestion
sometimes
more
annoying
than
dangerous
i
suppose
take
a
chair
you
you
can
find
a
place
for
your
hat
and
coat
right
on
the
table
there
well
he
added
settling
back
on
the
pillows
and
looking
at
vandover
pleasantly
i
think
you
grown
thinner
since
the
last
time
i
saw
you
have
you
yes
answered
vandover
grimly
i
guess
i
have
yes
yes
i
suppose
so
of
course
responded
the
lawyer
with
a
vague
air
of
apology
and
sympathy
you
have
had
a
trying
time
of
it
lately
taking
it
by
and
large
i
was
painfully
shocked
to
hear
of
your
father
death
i
had
met
him
at
lunch
hardly
a
week
before
he
was
a
far
heartier
man
than
i
was
eat
you
should
have
seen
splendid
appetite
he
spoke
at
length
of
you
i
remember
told
me
you
expected
to
go
abroad
soon
to
study
painting
in
fact
i
believe
he
was
to
go
to
paris
with
you
it
was
very
sad
and
very
sudden
but
you
know
we
all
been
expecting
been
fearing
that
for
some
time
they
both
were
silent
for
a
moment
the
lawyer
looking
absently
at
the
of
the
bed
nodding
his
head
slowly
from
time
to
time
repeating
yes
sir
yes
sir
suddenly
he
exclaimed
well
now
let
see
he
cleared
his
throat
coming
back
to
himself
again
and
continued
in
a
very
businesslike
and
systematic
tone
i
have
looked
over
your
father
papers
vandover
as
you
requested
me
to
and
i
have
taken
the
liberty
of
sending
for
you
to
let
you
know
exactly
how
you
stand
that
the
idea
sir
said
vandover
very
attentive
drawing
up
his
chair
field
took
a
great
package
of
oblong
papers
from
the
small
table
that
stood
at
the
head
of
his
bed
and
looked
them
over
adjusting
his
eyeglasses
well
now
suppose
we
take
up
the
real
property
first
he
continued
drawing
out
three
or
four
of
these
papers
and
unfolding
them
all
of
your
father
money
was
invested
in
what
we
call
realty
he
talked
for
something
over
an
hour
occasionally
stopping
to
answer
a
question
of
vandover
or
interrupting
himself
to
ask
him
if
he
understood
at
the
end
it
amounted
to
this
the
bulk
of
the
estate
was
residence
property
in
distant
quarters
of
the
city
some
houses
very
cheaply
built
each
on
an
average
renting
for
dollars
when
all
of
these
were
rented
the
gross
monthly
income
was
seven
hundred
and
dollars
at
this
time
however
six
were
vacant
bringing
down
the
gross
receipts
per
month
to
five
hundred
and
sixty
dollars
the
expenses
which
included
water
commissions
for
collecting
repairs
taxes
interest
on
insurance
when
expressed
in
the
terms
of
a
monthly
average
amounted
to
one
hundred
and
dollars
well
now
let
see
said
vandover
figuring
on
his
cuff
one
hundred
and
from
five
hundred
and
sixty
leaves
me
a
net
monthly
income
of
three
hundred
and
no
three
hundred
and
dollars
the
lawyer
shook
his
head
while
he
drank
another
glass
of
hot
water
you
see
he
said
wiping
his
moustache
in
the
hollow
of
his
palm
you
see
we
have
figured
on
the
mortgages
yet
mortgages
echoed
vandover
yes
answered
field
when
i
spoke
of
expenses
i
was
basing
them
upon
the
monthly
statements
of
adams
brunt
your
father
agents
but
they
never
looked
after
the
mortgages
your
father
acted
directly
with
the
banks
in
that
matter
i
find
that
there
are
mortgages
that
cover
the
entire
property
even
the
homestead
they
are
for
and
per
cent
in
some
cases
there
are
two
mortgages
on
the
same
piece
of
property
well
said
vandover
well
answered
the
lawyer
the
interest
on
these
foots
up
to
about
two
hundred
and
ninety
dollars
a
month
vandover
made
another
hasty
calculation
on
his
cuff
and
leaned
back
in
his
chair
staring
at
the
lawyer
saying
why
that
leaves
dollars
a
month
net
yes
assented
field
i
made
it
that
too
why
the
governor
used
to
allow
fifty
a
month
returned
vandover
just
for
pocket
money
i
afraid
you
must
expect
anything
like
that
now
vandover
replied
field
smiling
you
see
when
your
father
was
alive
and
pursuing
his
profession
he
made
a
comfortable
income
besides
that
which
he
derived
from
his
realty
his
law
business
i
consider
to
have
been
excellent
when
you
take
everything
into
consideration
he
often
made
five
hundred
dollars
a
month
at
it
such
are
the
figures
his
papers
show
he
could
make
you
a
handsome
allowance
while
he
was
alive
but
all
that
is
stopped
now
well
but
did
he
did
he
leave
any
money
any
any
any
lump
sum
inquired
vandover
incredulously
there
was
his
bank
account
answered
the
other
you
see
he
invested
most
of
his
savings
in
this
same
realty
and
since
he
stopped
building
he
seems
to
have
lived
right
up
to
his
income
but
dollars
repeated
vandover
why
look
at
the
house
on
california
street
where
we
live
it
costs
that
much
to
run
it
the
servants
and
all
here
your
father
book
answered
field
taking
it
up
and
turning
the
leaves
one
hundred
and
dollars
a
month
were
the
average
running
expenses
one
hundred
and
shouted
vandover
feeling
suddenly
as
if
the
ground
were
opening
under
him
why
great
heavens
field
where
am
i
going
to
get
what
am
i
going
to
field
smiled
a
little
well
he
said
you
must
make
up
your
mind
to
live
more
modestly
modestly
exclaimed
vandover
scornfully
you
have
to
rent
the
house
and
take
rooms
vandover
gave
a
gasp
of
relief
i
had
thought
of
that
he
answered
subsiding
at
once
how
much
would
it
bring
the
house
the
lawyer
hesitated
as
to
this
that
i
could
hardly
tell
you
definitely
he
answered
shaking
his
head
adams
brunt
could
give
you
more
exact
figures
in
fact
i
would
suggest
that
you
put
it
into
their
hands
california
near
franklin
is
it
yes
the
neighbourhood
is
what
it
used
to
be
you
know
every
one
wants
to
live
out
on
pacific
heights
now
double
house
yes
well
with
the
furniture
i
suppose
oh
i
do
know
say
a
hundred
and
fifty
but
you
know
my
estimate
is
only
guesswork
brunt
is
the
man
you
want
to
see
well
answered
vandover
solaced
that
makes
two
more
like
it
but
he
added
hastily
you
say
the
homestead
is
mortgaged
as
well
how
about
the
interest
on
that
you
need
be
bothered
about
that
answered
field
the
interest
on
mortgage
is
included
in
the
two
hundred
and
ninety
that
i
spoke
of
and
the
insurance
interest
on
the
homestead
is
included
in
adams
brunt
statement
that
was
on
the
whole
estate
the
homestead
you
understand
but
there
is
another
thing
you
must
look
out
for
most
of
the
mortgages
are
for
one
year
and
every
time
they
are
renewed
there
is
an
expense
of
between
forty
and
fifty
dollars
yes
i
see
assented
vandover
now
resumed
the
lawyer
here
is
your
father
bank
account
he
had
in
the
first
national
to
his
credit
between
nine
and
ten
thousand
dollars
nine
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
to
be
exact
his
professional
account
book
shows
that
there
is
now
due
him
in
bills
and
notes
eight
hundred
and
thirty
dollars
on
the
debit
side
he
owes
in
all
nine
hundred
the
difference
you
see
is
seventy
nine
thousand
seven
hundred
and
ninety
less
seventy
leaves
a
balance
of
nine
thousand
seven
hundred
and
twenty
all
clear
he
asked
interrupting
himself
vandover
nodded
and
the
other
continued
now
your
father
left
a
will
here
it
is
i
drew
it
for
him
a
year
ago
last
september
he
has
given
fifteen
hundred
dollars
to
some
cousin
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
and
six
hundred
to
a
few
charities
here
in
the
city
the
remainder
seven
thousand
five
hundred
and
twenty
and
all
the
rest
of
the
estate
is
left
to
you
with
the
wish
that
you
pursue
your
art
studies
abroad
brunt
of
adams
brunt
and
myself
are
appointed
executors
so
now
that
is
just
how
you
stand
as
far
as
i
can
see
hundred
dollars
in
ready
money
and
if
we
suppose
you
rent
the
california
street
house
income
property
that
nets
you
two
hundred
and
a
month
the
will
will
have
to
be
probated
some
time
next
month
and
you
will
have
to
appear
however
i
shall
let
you
know
about
that
in
time
during
the
next
two
weeks
vandover
was
plunged
into
the
affairs
of
business
for
the
first
time
in
his
life
it
interested
and
amused
him
and
he
felt
a
certain
in
handling
large
sums
of
money
and
in
figuring
interest
rents
and
percentages
three
days
after
his
interview
with
field
the
sale
of
his
father
office
effects
took
place
and
the
consequent
five
hundred
dollars
vandover
turned
over
into
the
hands
of
the
lawyer
who
was
already
looking
for
an
investment
for
the
hundred
this
matter
had
given
vandover
considerable
anxiety
i
do
want
anything
fancy
he
said
to
field
no
big
per
cents
and
bigger
risks
if
i
got
to
live
economically
i
want
something
secure
a
good
solid
investment
do
you
know
with
a
fair
interest
that
what
i
looking
for
yes
answered
the
lawyer
grimly
i
been
looking
for
that
myself
ever
since
i
was
your
age
they
both
laughed
and
the
lawyer
added
has
brunt
found
a
tenant
for
the
california
street
house
yet
no
well
perhaps
you
had
better
keep
that
five
hundred
for
your
running
expenses
until
he
does
it
will
probably
take
some
time
all
right
answered
vandover
there
were
a
couple
of
women
up
to
look
at
the
place
yesterday
but
they
wanted
to
use
it
for
a
i
wo
hear
to
that
brunt
says
they
would
ruin
it
dead
sure
i
suppose
you
are
looking
around
yourself
for
rooms
inquired
field
have
you
found
anything
to
suit
you
no
answered
vandover
i
have
not
i
do
like
the
idea
of
living
in
one
of
the
downtown
hotels
and
as
far
as
i
have
looked
the
uptown
flats
are
rather
steep
however
i
have
gone
around
very
much
as
yet
i
been
so
busy
oh
how
about
the
paving
of
the
street
in
front
of
those
bush
street
houses
of
mine
brunt
says
that
the
supervisors
have
passed
a
resolution
of
intention
to
that
effect
now
shall
i
let
the
city
contractor
have
the
job
or
give
it
to
brunt
man
better
let
the
city
people
do
it
advised
field
they
may
charge
more
but
you
need
pay
for
a
long
time
by
the
end
of
three
weeks
vandover
had
sickened
of
the
whole
thing
the
novelty
was
gone
and
business
affairs
no
longer
amused
him
besides
this
he
was
anxious
to
settle
down
in
some
comfortable
rooms
it
was
now
the
middle
of
winter
and
he
had
determined
that
it
was
not
the
season
for
a
european
trip
he
would
wait
until
the
summer
before
going
to
paris
little
by
little
vandover
turned
over
the
supervision
and
management
of
his
affairs
and
his
property
to
adams
brunt
declaring
that
he
could
not
afford
to
be
bothered
with
them
any
longer
this
course
was
much
more
expensive
and
by
no
means
so
satisfactory
from
a
business
point
of
view
but
vandover
felt
as
though
the
loss
in
money
was
more
than
offset
by
his
freedom
from
annoyance
and
responsibility
he
was
eager
to
get
settled
the
idea
of
taking
rooms
that
should
be
all
his
own
and
that
he
could
fit
up
to
suit
his
taste
attracted
him
immensely
already
he
saw
himself
installed
in
charming
apartments
the
walls
covered
with
rough
paper
forming
an
admirable
background
for
small
plaster
casts
of
assyrian
and
photogravures
of
velasquez
portraits
there
would
be
a
over
the
mantelpiece
and
a
with
a
corduroy
cushion
such
as
he
had
had
in
his
room
in
matthew
very
slowly
his
father
affairs
were
settled
and
by
degrees
the
estate
began
to
adjust
itself
to
the
new
grooves
in
which
it
was
to
run
by
the
middle
of
december
everything
was
beginning
to
go
smoothly
and
the
day
before
christmas
field
announced
to
vandover
that
he
had
invested
his
hundred
in
registered
per
cents
they
had
had
several
long
talks
concerning
this
sum
of
money
and
in
the
end
had
concluded
that
it
would
be
better
to
invest
it
in
some
such
fashion
rather
than
to
take
up
any
of
the
mortgages
that
were
on
the
houses
during
the
first
weeks
of
the
new
year
the
house
on
california
street
was
rented
for
one
hundred
and
dollars
to
an
english
gentleman
the
president
of
a
fruit
syndicate
in
the
southern
part
of
the
state
there
were
but
three
in
the
family
and
though
the
rent
was
below
that
which
vandover
had
desired
brunt
advised
him
to
close
the
transaction
at
once
as
they
were
desirable
tenants
and
would
probably
stay
in
the
house
a
long
time
on
the
last
evening
which
he
was
to
spend
in
his
home
vandover
cast
up
his
accounts
and
made
out
a
schedule
as
to
his
monthly
income
rent
from
realty
net
average
rent
from
homestead
property
on
california
street
interest
on
bonds
per
cent
total
in
small
iron
safe
received
from
sale
of
office
effects
expenses
outstanding
bills
lawyer
fees
bill
expenses
for
collecting
etc
balance
january
then
with
a
shrug
of
the
shoulders
he
dismissed
the
whole
burdensome
business
from
his
mind
brunt
would
manage
his
property
sending
him
regularly
the
monthly
statement
in
order
to
keep
him
informed
the
english
gentleman
of
the
fruit
syndicate
would
add
his
hundred
and
and
the
per
faithfully
brooding
over
his
hundred
in
the
dark
of
the
safety
deposit
drawer
would
bring
forth
their
little
quota
of
with
absolute
certainty
two
a
month
yes
he
was
comfortably
fixed
and
was
free
now
to
do
exactly
as
he
pleased
his
first
object
now
was
to
settle
down
for
the
winter
in
some
pleasant
rooms
he
had
decided
that
he
would
look
for
a
suite
of
three
a
bedroom
studio
and
the
bedroom
he
was
not
particular
about
the
studio
he
hoped
would
have
plenty
of
light
from
the
north
but
the
be
sunny
and
overlook
the
street
else
what
would
be
the
use
of
a
as
to
the
neighbourhood
he
thought
he
would
prefer
sutter
street
anywhere
between
leavenworth
and
powell
in
the
downtown
part
this
street
was
entirely
given
over
to
business
houses
in
the
far
uptown
quarter
it
was
lined
with
residences
but
between
these
two
undesirable
extremes
was
an
intermediate
district
where
the
residences
had
given
place
to
flats
and
the
business
blocks
to
occasional
stores
it
was
a
neighbourhood
affected
by
doctors
dentists
and
reputable
drug
stores
occupied
many
of
the
corners
here
and
there
a
fine
residence
still
withstood
the
advance
of
business
there
were
a
number
of
great
apartment
houses
and
even
one
or
two
club
buildings
it
was
a
gay
locality
not
too
noisy
not
too
quiet
the
street
was
one
of
the
great
arteries
of
travel
between
the
business
and
the
residence
portions
of
the
city
and
its
were
frequented
by
ladies
going
to
their
shopping
or
downtown
marketing
or
to
and
from
the
matinées
acquaintances
of
vandover
were
almost
sure
to
pass
at
every
hour
he
took
rooms
temporarily
at
the
palace
and
at
once
set
about
locating
on
sutter
street
he
had
recourse
again
to
brunt
who
furnished
him
with
a
long
list
of
vacancies
in
that
neighbourhood
was
an
agreeable
pastime
to
vandover
though
in
the
end
it
began
to
bore
him
altogether
he
visited
some
fifteen
or
twenty
suites
in
each
case
trying
to
fit
himself
into
the
rooms
imagining
how
the
would
look
in
such
a
window
how
the
would
show
over
such
a
mantel
just
where
on
such
walls
the
assyrian
could
be
placed
to
the
best
advantage
and
if
his
easel
could
receive
enough
steady
light
from
such
windows
then
he
considered
the
conveniences
the
baths
the
electric
light
and
the
heat
after
a
two
weeks
search
he
had
decided
upon
one
of
two
suites
both
of
these
were
in
the
desired
neighbourhood
but
differed
widely
in
other
respects
the
first
was
reasonable
enough
in
the
matter
of
rent
and
had
even
been
occupied
by
an
artist
for
some
three
or
four
years
previous
however
the
room
that
vandover
proposed
to
use
as
a
was
small
and
had
no
double
windows
thus
making
the
an
impossibility
there
did
not
seem
to
be
any
suitable
place
for
the
assyrian
and
the
mantelpiece
was
of
white
marble
like
the
mantelpiece
in
wade
front
parlour
a
veritable
horror
it
revolted
vandover
even
to
think
of
putting
a
over
it
these
defects
were
offset
by
the
studio
a
large
and
splendid
room
with
hardwood
floors
and
an
enormous
north
light
the
legendary
studio
the
dream
of
an
artist
precisely
such
a
studio
as
vandover
had
hoped
he
would
occupy
in
the
quarter
the
other
suite
was
in
a
great
apartment
house
a
hotel
in
fact
but
very
expensive
with
electric
bulbs
and
bells
and
with
a
tiled
bathroom
connecting
with
the
bedroom
the
room
which
he
would
be
obliged
to
use
as
his
studio
was
small
dark
the
light
coming
from
the
west
but
the
was
perfect
it
had
the
sun
all
day
long
through
a
huge
bay
window
that
seemed
to
have
been
made
for
a
there
were
admirable
spaces
on
the
walls
for
casts
and
pictures
and
the
mantelpiece
was
charming
extremely
high
and
made
of
oak
in
a
word
the
exact
that
vandover
had
in
mind
already
he
saw
himself
settled
there
as
comfortably
and
snugly
as
a
kernel
in
a
nutshell
it
was
true
that
upon
investigation
he
found
that
the
grate
had
been
plastered
up
and
the
flue
arranged
for
a
stove
but
for
that
matter
there
were
stoves
to
be
had
that
would
permit
the
fire
to
be
seen
and
that
would
look
just
as
cheerful
as
a
grate
he
had
even
seen
such
a
stove
in
the
window
of
a
hardware
store
downtown
a
tiled
stove
with
a
brass
fender
and
with
curious
flamboyant
ornaments
of
a
jewel
of
a
stove
for
two
days
vandover
hesitated
between
these
two
suites
undecided
whether
he
should
sacrifice
his
studio
for
his
or
his
for
his
studio
at
length
he
came
to
the
conclusion
that
as
he
was
now
to
be
an
artist
a
good
studio
ought
to
be
the
first
consideration
and
that
since
he
was
to
settle
down
to
hard
serious
work
at
last
he
owed
it
to
himself
to
have
a
fitting
place
in
which
to
paint
yes
decidedly
he
would
take
the
suite
with
the
studio
he
went
to
the
agent
told
him
of
his
decision
and
put
up
a
deposit
to
secure
the
rooms
the
same
day
upon
which
he
took
this
decided
step
he
had
occasion
to
pass
by
both
places
in
question
as
he
approached
the
apartment
house
in
which
the
rejected
suite
was
situated
it
occurred
to
him
to
tell
the
clerk
in
the
office
that
he
had
decided
against
the
rooms
he
could
take
a
last
look
at
them
at
the
same
time
he
was
shown
up
to
the
rooms
again
and
walked
about
in
the
asking
the
same
questions
about
the
heat
the
plumbing
and
the
baths
he
even
went
to
the
window
and
looked
out
into
the
street
it
a
berth
just
the
same
and
how
jolly
it
would
be
to
lounge
in
the
of
a
morning
with
a
paper
a
cigarette
and
a
cup
of
coffee
watching
the
people
on
their
way
downtown
the
women
going
to
their
shopping
and
morning
marketing
then
all
at
once
he
remembered
that
at
most
he
would
only
have
these
rooms
for
five
months
and
reflected
that
if
his
whole
life
was
to
be
devoted
to
painting
he
might
easily
put
up
with
an
inconvenient
studio
for
a
few
months
once
at
paris
all
would
be
different
at
that
the
rooms
took
on
a
more
charming
aspect
than
ever
never
had
they
appeared
cheerier
sunnier
more
comfortable
never
had
the
oak
mantel
and
the
tiled
stove
with
the
flamboyant
ornaments
been
more
desirable
never
had
a
seemed
more
luxurious
never
a
more
delectable
while
at
the
same
time
the
other
rooms
the
rooms
of
the
big
studio
presented
themselves
to
his
imagination
more
sombre
uncomfortable
and
forbidding
than
ever
it
was
out
of
the
question
to
think
of
living
there
he
was
angry
with
himself
for
having
hesitated
so
long
but
suddenly
he
remembered
the
deposit
he
had
already
made
it
was
ten
dollars
for
a
moment
he
paused
then
dismissed
the
matter
with
an
impatient
shrug
of
the
shoulders
so
much
the
worse
he
said
what
ten
dollars
he
made
up
his
mind
then
and
there
and
went
downstairs
walking
on
his
heels
to
tell
the
clerk
that
after
all
he
would
engage
the
rooms
from
that
date
chapter
twelve
vandover
took
formal
possession
of
his
rooms
on
sutter
street
during
the
first
few
days
of
february
for
a
week
previous
they
had
been
in
the
greatest
confusion
the
studio
filled
with
a
great
number
of
trunks
crates
packing
cases
and
furniture
still
in
its
sacking
in
the
bedroom
was
stored
the
furniture
that
had
been
moved
out
of
the
while
the
itself
was
given
over
to
the
paperhangers
and
carpenters
vandover
himself
appeared
from
time
to
time
inquiring
anxiously
as
to
the
arrival
of
his
stuff
or
sitting
on
a
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
hat
pushed
back
and
a
cigarette
between
his
lips
he
had
passed
a
delightful
week
selecting
the
wall
paper
and
the
pattern
for
the
frieze
buying
rugs
screens
assyrian
photogravures
of
renaissance
portraits
and
the
famous
tiled
stove
with
its
flamboyant
ornaments
just
after
renting
his
home
he
had
had
a
talk
with
the
english
gentleman
of
the
fruit
syndicate
and
had
spoken
about
certain
ornaments
and
bits
of
furniture
valuable
chiefly
to
himself
which
he
wished
to
keep
the
president
of
the
fruit
syndicate
had
been
very
gracious
in
the
matter
and
as
soon
as
vandover
had
taken
his
rooms
he
had
removed
two
great
cases
of
such
articles
from
the
california
street
house
and
had
stored
them
in
the
studio
after
the
workmen
were
gone
away
vandover
began
the
labour
of
arrangement
aided
by
one
of
the
paperhangers
he
had
retained
for
that
purpose
it
was
a
work
of
three
days
but
at
last
everything
was
in
its
place
and
one
evening
toward
the
middle
of
the
month
vandover
stood
in
the
middle
of
the
in
his
holding
the
tweezers
and
a
length
of
in
his
hand
and
looked
around
him
in
his
new
home
the
walls
were
hung
with
dull
blue
paper
of
a
very
rough
texture
set
off
by
a
narrow
picture
moulding
of
ivory
white
a
dark
red
carpet
covered
with
rugs
and
skins
lay
on
the
floor
upon
the
wall
reaching
to
the
floor
hung
a
huge
rug
of
sombre
colours
against
which
were
fixed
a
fencing
trophy
a
pair
of
antlers
a
little
water
colour
sketch
of
a
norwegian
fjord
and
vandover
banjo
underneath
it
was
a
low
but
very
broad
divan
covered
with
corduroy
to
the
right
and
left
of
this
divan
stood
bookcases
with
olive
green
curtains
their
tops
serving
as
shelves
for
a
multitude
of
small
ornaments
casts
of
animals
by
fremiet
and
barye
donatello
lovely
beer
steins
a
little
bronze
clock
a
calendar
and
a
yellow
satin
slipper
of
flossie
in
which
vandover
kept
turkish
cigarettes
the
with
the
huge
blue
blotter
in
a
silver
frame
the
and
the
enormous
brass
inkstand
filled
the
corner
to
the
right
of
the
divan
while
drawn
up
to
it
was
the
huge
leather
chair
the
chair
in
which
the
old
gentleman
had
died
in
the
drawer
of
the
desk
vandover
kept
his
father
revolver
he
never
thought
of
loading
it
of
late
he
had
only
used
it
to
drive
tacks
with
when
he
could
not
find
the
hammer
opposite
the
divan
on
the
other
side
of
the
room
was
the
famous
tiled
stove
with
the
flamboyant
ornaments
back
of
this
the
mantel
and
over
the
mantel
a
row
of
twelve
grotesque
heads
in
plaster
with
a
space
between
each
for
a
pipe
to
the
left
in
the
angle
of
the
room
stood
the
japanese
screen
in
black
and
gold
and
close
to
this
a
of
bamboo
and
a
with
a
great
shade
of
crinkly
red
paper
that
turner
ravis
had
given
to
vandover
one
christmas
the
bay
window
was
filled
by
the
covered
with
corduroy
like
the
divan
and
heaped
with
cushions
one
of
them
of
flaming
yellow
the
one
spot
of
vivid
colour
amidst
the
dull
browns
and
sombre
blues
of
the
room
a
great
sideboard
with
decanters
and
glasses
and
faced
the
window
from
the
end
wall
the
entrance
to
the
studio
opened
to
the
left
of
it
which
entrance
vandover
had
hung
with
curtains
of
plush
the
casts
of
the
assyrian
were
against
the
wall
upon
either
side
of
the
window
there
were
three
of
them
two
representing
scenes
from
the
life
of
the
king
the
third
the
wounded
lioness
which
vandover
never
wearied
of
admiring
upon
the
wall
over
the
mantel
hung
two
very
large
photogravures
one
of
rembrandt
night
watch
the
other
a
portrait
of
velasquez
representing
a
young
man
with
a
hunting
spear
above
one
of
the
bookcases
was
an
admirable
reproduction
of
the
mona
lisa
above
the
other
a
carbon
print
of
a
vandyke
a
dutch
lady
in
a
silk
gown
and
very
high
ruff
by
the
side
of
the
mona
lisa
however
was
a
cheap
brass
rack
stuffed
with
photographs
actresses
in
tights
french
quadrille
dancers
high
kickers
and
chorus
girls
in
the
studio
vandover
had
tacked
great
squares
and
stripes
of
cloth
against
the
walls
to
serve
as
a
background
for
his
sketches
some
dozen
or
more
portfolios
and
stretchers
were
leaned
against
the
baseboard
and
a
few
ornaments
and
pieces
of
furniture
such
things
as
vandover
set
but
little
store
by
were
carelessly
arranged
about
the
room
the
throne
and
huge
easel
were
disposed
so
as
to
receive
as
much
light
as
was
possible
beyond
the
studio
was
the
bedroom
but
here
there
was
only
the
regulation
furniture
some
scores
of
photographs
of
vandover
friends
were
tacked
upon
the
walls
or
thrust
between
the
wood
and
glass
of
the
mirror
a
new
life
now
began
for
vandover
a
life
of
luxury
and
aimlessness
which
he
found
charming
he
had
no
duties
no
cares
no
responsibilities
but
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
he
was
in
a
manner
changed
the
old
life
of
dissipation
seemed
to
have
lost
its
charm
for
nearly
years
nothing
extraordinary
had
happened
to
break
in
upon
the
uneventful
and
ordinary
course
of
his
existence
and
then
suddenly
three
great
catastrophes
had
befallen
like
the
springing
of
three
successive
mines
beneath
his
feet
ida
suicide
the
wreck
and
his
father
death
all
within
a
month
the
whole
fabric
of
his
character
had
been
shaken
jostled
out
of
its
old
shape
his
desire
of
vice
was
numbed
his
evil
habits
all
deranged
here
if
ever
was
the
chance
to
begin
anew
to
commence
all
over
again
it
seemed
an
easy
matter
he
would
merely
have
to
remain
inactive
impassive
and
his
character
would
of
itself
upon
the
new
conditions
but
vandover
made
another
fatal
mistake
the
brute
in
him
had
only
been
stunned
the
snake
was
only
soothed
his
better
self
was
as
sluggish
as
the
brute
and
his
desire
of
art
as
numb
as
his
desire
of
vice
it
was
not
a
continued
state
of
inaction
and
idleness
that
could
help
him
but
rather
an
active
and
energetic
arousing
and
spurring
up
of
those
better
qualities
in
him
still
dormant
and
inert
the
fabric
of
his
nature
was
shaken
and
broken
up
it
was
true
but
if
he
left
it
to
itself
there
was
danger
that
it
would
upon
the
old
lines
and
this
was
precisely
what
vandover
did
as
rapidly
as
ever
his
pliable
character
adapted
itself
to
the
new
environment
he
had
nothing
to
do
there
was
lacking
both
the
desire
and
necessity
to
keep
him
at
his
easel
he
neglected
his
painting
utterly
he
never
thought
of
attending
the
at
the
art
school
long
since
he
had
given
up
his
downtown
studio
he
was
content
to
be
idle
listless
apathetic
letting
the
days
bring
whatever
they
chose
making
no
effort
toward
any
fixed
routine
allowing
his
habits
to
be
formed
by
the
exigencies
of
the
hour
he
rose
late
and
took
his
breakfast
in
his
room
after
breakfast
he
sat
in
his
reading
his
paper
smoking
his
pipe
drinking
his
coffee
and
watching
the
women
on
their
way
downtown
to
their
shopping
or
marketing
then
as
the
fancy
moved
him
he
read
a
novel
wrote
a
few
letters
or
passed
an
hour
in
the
studio
dabbling
with
some
sketches
for
the
last
enemy
very
often
he
put
in
the
whole
morning
doing
pen
and
inks
of
pretty
smartly
dressed
girls
after
manner
which
he
gave
away
afterward
to
his
friends
in
the
afternoon
he
read
or
picked
the
banjo
or
sitting
down
to
the
little
piano
he
had
rented
played
over
his
three
pieces
the
two
polkas
and
the
air
of
the
topical
song
at
three
especially
of
wednesday
and
saturday
afternoons
he
bestirred
himself
dressed
very
carefully
and
went
downtown
to
promenade
kearney
and
market
streets
stopping
occasionally
at
the
imperial
where
he
sometimes
found
ellis
and
geary
and
where
he
took
cocktails
in
their
company
he
rarely
went
out
in
the
evenings
his
father
death
had
changed
all
that
at
least
for
a
while
he
had
not
seen
turner
ravis
nor
henrietta
vance
for
nearly
two
months
vandover
took
his
greatest
pleasure
while
in
his
new
quarters
delighted
to
be
pottering
about
his
by
the
hour
setting
it
to
rights
rearranging
the
smaller
ornaments
adjusting
the
calendar
winding
the
clock
and
above
all
tending
the
famous
tiled
stove
in
his
idleness
he
grew
to
have
small
and
petty
ways
the
entire
day
went
in
doing
little
things
he
passed
one
whole
afternoon
delightfully
whittling
out
a
new
banjo
bridge
from
the
cover
of
a
scraping
it
smooth
afterward
with
a
bit
of
glass
the
winding
of
his
clock
was
quite
an
occurrence
in
the
course
of
the
day
something
to
be
looked
forward
to
the
mixing
of
his
tobacco
was
a
positive
event
and
undertaken
with
all
gravity
while
the
task
of
keeping
it
moist
and
ripe
in
the
blue
china
jar
with
the
sponge
attachment
that
always
stood
on
the
bamboo
by
the
japanese
screen
was
a
wearing
anxiety
that
was
yet
a
pleasure
it
became
a
fad
with
him
to
do
without
matches
using
as
a
substitute
lights
tapers
of
twisted
paper
to
be
ignited
at
the
famous
stove
he
found
amusement
for
two
days
in
twisting
and
rolling
these
lights
cutting
frills
in
the
larger
ends
with
a
pair
of
scissors
and
stacking
them
afterward
in
a
chinese
flower
jar
he
had
bought
for
the
purpose
and
stood
on
top
of
the
bookcases
the
lights
were
admirably
made
and
looked
very
pretty
when
he
had
done
he
counted
them
he
had
made
two
hundred
exactly
what
a
coincidence
but
the
stove
the
famous
tiled
stove
with
flamboyant
ornaments
was
the
chiefest
joy
of
vandover
new
life
he
was
delighted
with
it
it
was
so
artistic
so
curious
it
kept
the
fire
so
well
it
looked
so
cheerful
and
inviting
a
stove
that
was
the
life
and
soul
of
the
whole
room
a
stove
to
draw
up
to
and
talk
to
no
never
was
there
such
a
stove
there
was
hardly
a
minute
of
the
day
he
was
not
fussing
with
it
raking
it
down
turning
the
damper
off
and
on
opening
and
shutting
the
door
filling
it
with
coal
putting
the
blower
on
and
then
taking
it
off
again
sweeping
away
the
ashes
with
a
little
broom
or
studying
the
pictures
upon
the
tiles
the
punishment
of
caliban
and
his
associates
romeo
and
juliet
the
fall
of
phaeton
he
even
pretended
to
the
chambermaid
that
he
alone
understood
how
to
manage
the
stove
forbidding
her
to
touch
it
assuring
her
that
it
had
to
be
coaxed
and
humoured
often
late
in
the
evening
as
he
was
going
to
bed
he
would
find
the
fire
in
it
drowsing
then
he
would
hustle
it
sharply
to
arouse
it
punching
it
with
the
poker
talking
to
it
saying
wake
up
there
you
and
then
when
the
fire
was
snapping
he
would
sit
before
it
in
his
bathrobe
absorbing
its
heat
luxuriously
and
scratching
himself
as
was
his
custom
for
over
an
hour
but
very
often
in
the
evening
he
would
have
the
boys
ellis
geary
and
young
haight
up
to
a
little
improvised
supper
they
would
bring
home
with
them
and
vandover
would
try
to
make
welsh
rabbits
which
did
not
always
come
out
well
and
which
they
oftentimes
drank
instead
of
ate
ellis
always
very
silent
would
mix
and
drink
cocktails
continually
vandover
would
pick
his
banjo
and
together
with
young
haight
would
listen
to
geary
ah
you
bet
this
one
would
say
i
going
to
make
my
pile
in
this
town
i
can
do
it
beale
sent
me
to
court
the
other
morning
to
get
the
judge
signature
he
had
a
grouch
on
and
wanted
to
put
me
off
you
ought
to
have
heard
me
jolly
him
i
talked
right
up
to
him
yes
sir
you
bet
did
i
have
the
gall
that
the
way
you
want
to
do
to
get
along
get
right
in
and
not
be
afraid
i
got
his
signature
you
bet
ah
i
right
in
it
with
beale
he
thinks
i
hot
stuff
now
that
there
was
nothing
to
worry
him
and
little
to
occupy
his
mind
vandover
gave
himself
over
considerably
to
those
animal
pleasures
which
he
enjoyed
so
much
he
lay
abed
late
in
the
morning
dozing
between
the
warm
sheets
he
overfed
himself
at
table
and
drank
too
much
wine
he
ate
between
meals
having
filled
his
sideboard
with
canned
patés
potted
birds
and
devilled
meats
while
upon
the
bamboo
table
stood
a
tin
box
of
chocolates
out
of
which
he
ate
whole
handfuls
at
a
time
he
would
take
this
box
into
the
bathroom
with
him
and
eat
while
he
lay
in
the
hot
water
until
he
was
overcome
by
the
enervating
warmth
and
by
the
steam
and
would
then
drop
off
to
sleep
it
was
during
these
days
that
vandover
took
up
his
seriously
if
it
could
be
said
that
he
did
anything
seriously
at
this
time
he
took
occasional
lessons
of
a
mexican
in
a
room
above
a
wigmaker
store
on
market
street
and
learned
to
play
by
note
for
a
little
time
he
really
applied
himself
after
he
had
mastered
the
customary
style
of
play
he
began
to
affect
the
more
brilliant
and
fancy
performances
playing
two
banjos
at
once
or
putting
nickels
under
the
bridge
and
picking
the
strings
with
a
to
imitate
a
mandolin
he
even
made
up
some
comical
pieces
that
had
a
great
success
among
the
boys
one
of
these
he
called
the
pleasing
production
another
was
the
imitation
of
the
midway
plaisance
music
and
a
third
had
for
title
a
sailor
robbing
a
ship
in
which
he
managed
to
imitate
the
sounds
of
the
lapping
of
the
water
the
creaking
of
the
oarlocks
the
tramp
of
the
sailor
feet
upon
the
deck
the
pistol
shot
that
destroyed
him
and
by
running
up
the
frets
on
the
his
dying
groans
a
finale
that
never
failed
to
produce
a
tremendous
effect
chapter
thirteen
just
before
lent
and
about
three
months
after
the
death
of
father
henrietta
vance
gave
a
reception
and
dance
at
her
house
the
affair
was
one
of
a
series
that
the
girls
of
the
cotillon
had
been
giving
to
the
men
of
the
same
club
vandover
had
gone
to
all
but
the
last
which
had
occurred
while
he
was
at
coronado
he
was
sure
of
meeting
geary
young
haight
turner
ravis
and
all
the
people
of
his
set
at
these
functions
and
had
always
managed
to
have
a
very
jolly
time
he
had
been
very
quiet
since
his
father
death
and
had
hardly
gone
out
at
all
in
fact
since
ida
wade
death
and
his
trip
down
the
coast
he
had
seen
none
of
his
acquaintances
except
the
boys
but
he
determined
now
that
he
would
go
to
this
dance
and
in
so
doing
return
once
more
to
the
world
that
he
knew
by
this
time
he
had
become
pretty
well
accustomed
to
his
father
death
and
saw
no
reason
why
he
should
not
have
a
good
time
at
first
he
thought
he
would
ask
turner
to
go
with
him
but
in
the
end
made
up
his
mind
to
go
alone
instead
one
always
had
a
better
time
when
one
went
alone
young
haight
would
have
liked
to
have
asked
turner
but
did
not
because
he
supposed
of
course
that
vandover
would
take
her
in
the
end
turner
had
delphine
act
as
her
escort
vandover
arrived
at
henrietta
vance
house
at
about
eight
a
couple
of
workmen
were
stretching
the
last
guy
ropes
of
the
awning
that
reached
over
the
sidewalk
every
window
of
the
house
was
lighted
the
front
door
was
opened
for
the
guest
before
he
could
ring
and
he
passed
up
the
stairs
catching
a
glimpse
of
the
parlours
through
the
portières
of
the
doors
as
yet
they
were
empty
of
guests
the
floors
were
covered
with
canvas
and
the
walls
decorated
with
fern
leaves
in
a
window
recess
one
of
the
caterer
men
was
setting
out
two
punch
bowls
and
a
multitude
of
glass
cups
three
or
four
musicians
were
gathered
about
the
piano
tuning
up
and
one
heard
the
subdued
note
of
a
cornet
the
air
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
pinks
and
of
la
france
roses
at
the
turn
of
the
stairs
the
vances
second
girl
in
a
white
lawn
cap
directed
him
to
the
gentlemen
which
was
the
room
of
henrietta
vance
older
brother
about
a
dozen
men
were
here
before
him
some
rolling
up
their
overcoats
into
balls
and
stowing
them
with
their
canes
in
the
corners
of
the
room
others
laughing
and
smoking
together
and
still
others
who
were
either
brushing
their
hair
before
the
mirrors
or
sitting
on
the
bed
in
their
stocking
feet
breathing
upon
their
patent
leathers
warming
them
before
putting
them
on
there
were
one
or
two
who
knew
no
one
and
who
stood
about
unhappily
twisting
the
tissue
paper
from
the
buttons
of
their
new
gloves
and
looking
stupidly
at
the
pictures
on
the
walls
of
the
room
occasionally
one
of
the
gentlemen
would
step
to
the
door
and
look
out
into
the
hall
to
see
if
the
ladies
whom
they
were
escorting
were
yet
come
out
of
their
ready
to
go
down
on
the
centre
table
stood
three
boxes
of
cigars
and
a
great
many
packages
of
cigarettes
while
extra
hairbrushes
whiskbrooms
and
papers
of
pins
had
been
placed
about
the
bureau
as
vandover
came
in
he
nodded
pleasantly
to
such
of
the
men
as
he
knew
and
after
hiding
his
hat
and
coat
under
the
bed
shook
himself
into
his
clothes
again
and
rearranged
his
dress
tie
the
house
was
filling
up
rapidly
one
heard
the
deadened
roll
of
wheels
in
the
street
outside
the
banging
of
carriage
doors
and
an
incessant
rustle
of
stiff
skirts
ascending
the
stairs
from
the
came
an
increasing
soprano
chatter
while
downstairs
the
orchestra
around
the
piano
in
the
back
parlour
began
to
snarl
and
whine
louder
and
louder
about
the
halls
and
stairs
one
caught
brief
glimpses
of
white
and
blue
opera
cloaks
edged
with
alternating
with
the
gleam
of
a
starched
shirt
bosom
and
the
glint
of
a
highly
polished
silk
hat
odours
of
sachet
and
violets
came
and
went
elusively
or
mingled
with
those
of
the
roses
and
pinks
an
air
of
gayety
and
excitement
began
to
spread
throughout
the
house
hello
old
man
hello
van
charlie
geary
young
haight
and
ellis
came
in
together
hello
boys
answered
vandover
hairbrush
in
hand
turning
about
from
the
mirror
where
he
had
been
trying
to
make
his
hair
lie

a
fine
cutlet
for

precisely
at
this
moment
that
geary

his
first
advancement
in
life
beale
head
clerk
in
the
great

was
drawing

him
over
into
a
corner
talking
in
a
low
voice

than

answered

case
i
do

about

he
sick
so
often
i
afraid
we
may
have
to
let
him
go
altogether
suddenly
the
orchestra
downstairs
broke
out
into
a
clash
of
harmony
and
then
swung
off
with
the
beat
and
cadence
of
a
waltz
the
dance
was
beginning
a
great
bustle
and
hurrying
commenced
about
the
and
at
the
head
of
the
stairs
everybody
went
down
in
the
front
parlour
by
the
mantel
henrietta
vance
and
turner
stood
on
either
side
of
vance
receiving
shaking
hands
and
laughing
and
talking
with
the
different
guests
who
came
up
singly
in
couples
or
in
noisy
groups
no
one
was
dancing
yet
the
orchestra
stopped
with
a
flourish
of
the
cornet
and
at
once
a
great
crowding
and
pushing
began
amidst
a
vast
hum
of
talk
the
cards
were
being
filled
up
a
swarm
of
men
gathered
about
each
of
the
more
popular
girls
passing
her
card
from
hand
to
hand
while
she
smiled
upon
them
all
helplessly
and
the
had
run
short
and
some
of
the
men
were
obliged
to
use
their
visiting
cards
with
these
in
one
hand
and
the
stump
of
a
pencil
in
the
other
they
ran
about
from
group
to
group
pushing
elbowing
and
calling
over
one
another
heads
like
brokers
in
a
stock
exchange
geary
however
walked
about
calmly
smiling
contentedly
very
from
time
to
time
he
stopped
such
a
one
of
the
hurrying
excited
men
as
he
knew
and
showed
him
his
card
made
out
weeks
before
saying
ah
how
that
am
all
fixed
made
all
my
engagements
at
the
last
one
of
these
affairs
even
up
to
six
extras
that
the
way
you
want
to
rustle
young
haight
was
very
popular
everywhere
the
girls
nodded
and
smiled
at
him
many
even
saving
a
place
on
their
cards
for
him
before
he
had
asked
ellis
took
advantage
of
the
confusion
to
disappear
he
went
up
into
the
deserted
chose
a
cigar
unbuttoned
his
vest
and
sat
down
in
one
chair
putting
his
feet
upon
another
the
hum
of
the
dance
came
to
him
in
a
prolonged
and
soothing
murmur
and
he
enjoyed
it
in
some
strange
way
of
his
own
listening
and
smoking
stretched
out
at
ease
in
the
deserted
vandover
went
up
to
turner
ravis
smiling
and
holding
out
his
hand
she
seemed
to
be
curiously
embarrassed
when
she
saw
him
and
did
not
smile
back
at
him
he
asked
to
see
her
card
but
she
drew
her
hand
quickly
from
his
telling
him
that
she
was
going
home
early
and
was
not
dancing
at
all
that
in
fact
she
had
to
receive
instead
of
dance
it
was
evident
to
vandover
that
he
had
done
something
to
displease
her
and
he
quickly
concluded
that
it
was
because
he
had
not
asked
her
to
go
with
him
that
evening
he
turned
from
her
to
henrietta
vance
as
though
nothing
unusual
had
happened
resolving
to
see
her
later
in
the
evening
and
in
the
meanwhile
invent
some
suitable
excuse
henrietta
vance
did
not
even
see
his
hand
she
was
a
very
jolly
girl
ordinarily
and
laughed
all
the
time
now
she
looked
him
squarely
in
the
face
without
so
much
as
a
smile
at
once
angry
and
surprised
never
had
anything
seemed
so
hateful
and
disagreeable
vandover
put
his
hand
back
into
his
pocket
trying
to
carry
it
all
off
with
a
laugh
saying
in
order
to
make
her
laugh
with
him
as
he
used
to
do
hello
how
do
you
do
this
evening
it
a
pleasant
morning
this
afternoon
how
do
you
do
she
answered
nervously
refusing
to
laugh
then
she
turned
from
him
abruptly
to
talk
to
young
haight
little
cousin
hetty
vance
was
neither
embarrassed
nor
nervous
as
the
girls
had
been
she
stared
calmly
at
vandover
and
said
with
a
peculiar
smile
i
am
surprised
to
see
you
here
mr
vandover
an
hour
later
the
dance
was
in
full
swing
almost
every
number
was
a
waltz
or
a
the
music
being
the
topical
songs
and
popular
airs
of
the
day
set
to
dance
music
about
ten
between
two
dances
the
cornet
sounded
a
trumpet
call
the
conversation
ceased
in
a
moment
and
henrietta
brother
standing
by
the
piano
called
out
the
next
dance
will
be
the
adding
immediately
a
the
dance
recommenced
in
the
pauses
of
the
music
one
heard
the
rhythmic
movement
of
the
feet
shuffling
regularly
in
time
some
of
the
couples
waltzed
fast
whirling
about
the
rooms
bearing
around
corners
with
a
swirl
and
swing
of
silk
skirts
the
girls
faces
flushed
and
perspiring
their
eyes
their
bare
white
throats
warm
moist
and
alternately
swelling
and
contracting
with
their
quick
breathing
on
certain
of
these
girls
the
dancing
produced
a
peculiar
effect
the
continued
motion
the
whirl
of
the
lights
the
heat
of
the
room
the
heavy
perfume
of
the
flowers
the
cadence
of
the
music
even
the
physical
fatigue
reacted
in
some
strange
way
upon
their
oversensitive
feminine
nerves
the
monotony
of
repeated
sensation
producing
some
sort
of
mildly
hypnotic
effect
a
morbid
hysterical
pleasure
the
more
exquisite
because
mixed
with
pain
these
were
the
girls
whom
one
heard
declaring
that
they
could
dance
all
night
the
girls
who
could
dance
until
they
dropped
other
of
the
couples
danced
with
the
greatest
languor
and
gravity
their
arms
held
out
rigid
and
at
right
angles
with
their
bodies
about
the
doors
and
hallways
stood
the
unhappy
gentlemen
who
knew
no
one
watching
the
others
dance
feigning
to
be
amused
some
of
them
however
had
ascended
to
the
and
began
to
strike
up
an
acquaintance
with
each
other
and
with
ellis
smoking
incessantly
discussing
business
politics
and
even
religion
in
the
ladies
two
of
the
maids
were
holding
a
long
conversation
in
low
tones
their
heads
together
evidently
it
was
concerning
something
dreadful
they
continually
exclaimed
oh
and
ah
suddenly
sitting
back
from
each
other
shaking
their
heads
and
biting
their
nether
lips
on
the
top
floor
in
the
hall
the
servants
in
their
best
clothes
leaned
over
the
balustrade
nudging
each
other
talking
in
hoarse
whispers
or
pointing
with
thick
fingers
swollen
with
all
up
and
down
the
stairs
were
the
couples
who
were
sitting
out
the
dance
some
of
them
even
upon
the
circular
sofa
in
the
hall
over
the
first
landing
the
music
stopped
leaving
a
babel
of
talk
in
the
air
the
couples
fell
apart
for
an
instant
but
a
great
clapping
of
hands
broke
out
and
the
tired
musicians
heroically
recommenced
as
soon
as
the
short
was
done
there
was
a
rush
for
the
lemonade
and
punch
bowls
the
guests
thronged
around
them
joking
each
other
hello
are
you
here
oh
this
is
dreadful
this
makes
times
i
seen
you
here
a
smell
of
coffee
rose
into
the
air
from
the
basement
it
was
about
eleven
the
next
dance
was
the
supper
dance
and
the
gentlemen
hurried
about
anxiously
searching
the
stairs
the
parlours
and
the
conservatory
for
the
girls
who
had
promised
them
this
dance
weeks
before
the
musicians
were
playing
a
march
and
the
couples
crowded
down
the
narrow
stairs
in
single
file
the
ladies
drawing
off
their
gloves
the
tired
musicians
stretched
themselves
rubbed
their
eyes
and
began
to
talk
aloud
in
the
deserted
parlours
supper
was
served
in
the
huge
in
the
basement
and
was
eaten
in
a
storm
of
gayety
the
same
parties
and
sets
tried
to
get
together
at
the
same
table
henrietta
vance
party
was
particularly
noisy
at
her
table
there
was
an
incessant
clamour
of
screams
and
shouts
of
laughter
one
ate
oysters
la
and
croquettes
the
wines
were
sauternes
and
champagnes
with
the
nuts
and
dessert
the
caps
came
on
and
in
a
few
minutes
were
cracking
and
snapping
all
over
the
room
six
of
the
unfortunates
who
knew
no
one
but
who
had
managed
through
a
common
affliction
to
become
acquainted
with
each
other
gathered
at
a
separate
table
ellis
was
one
of
their
number
he
levied
a
assessment
and
tipped
the
waiter
a
dollar
and
a
half
this
one
accordingly
brought
them
extra
bottles
of
champagne
in
which
they
found
consolation
for
all
the
of
the
evening
after
supper
the
dancing
began
again
the
little
stiffness
and
constraint
of
the
earlier
part
of
the
evening
was
gone
by
this
time
nearly
everybody
except
the
unfortunates
knew
everybody
else
the
good
dinner
and
the
champagne
had
put
them
all
into
an
excellent
humour
and
they
all
commenced
to
be
very
jolly
they
began
a
virginia
reel
still
wearing
the
magician
caps
and
phrygian
bonnets
of
tissue
paper
young
haight
was
with
turner
ravis
as
much
as
possible
during
the
evening
very
happy
and
excited
something
had
happened
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
say
precisely
what
for
on
the
face
of
things
turner
was
the
same
as
ever
nothing
in
her
speech
or
actions
was
different
but
there
was
in
her
manner
in
the
very
air
that
surrounded
her
something
elusive
and
subtle
that
set
him
all
in
a
tremor
there
was
a
change
in
his
favour
he
felt
that
she
liked
to
have
him
with
her
and
that
she
was
trying
to
have
him
feel
as
much
in
some
mysterious
way
of
her
own
he
could
see
however
that
she
was
hardly
conscious
of
doing
this
and
that
the
change
was
more
apparent
to
his
eyes
than
it
was
to
hers
must
you
really
go
home
now
he
said
as
turner
began
to
talk
of
leaving
soon
after
supper
they
had
been
sitting
out
the
dance
under
a
palm
at
the
angle
of
the
stairs
yes
answered
turner
howard
has
the
measles
and
i
promised
to
be
home
early
delphine
was
to
come
for
me
and
she
ought
to
be
here
now
delphine
exclaimed
young
haight
did
you
come
with
van
no
answered
turner
quietly
only
by
her
manner
and
by
something
in
the
way
she
said
the
word
haight
knew
at
once
that
she
had
broken
definitely
with
vandover
the
talk
he
had
had
with
her
at
her
house
came
back
to
him
on
the
instant
he
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
asked
there
is
something
wrong
has
van
done
anything
never
mind
i
mean
that
it
no
business
of
mine
i
suppose
but
i
know
you
care
for
him
i
sorry
if
but
he
was
not
sorry
try
as
he
would
his
heart
was
leaping
in
him
for
joy
with
vandover
out
of
the
way
he
knew
that
all
would
be
different
turner
herself
had
said
so
oh
everything
is
wrong
said
turner
with
tears
in
her
eyes
i
have
been
so
disappointed
in
van
oh
terribly
disappointed
i
know
yes
i
think
i
know
what
you
mean
answered
young
haight
in
a
low
voice
oh
please
do
let
talk
about
it
at
all
cried
turner
but
young
haight
could
not
stop
now
is
van
really
out
of
the
question
then
he
asked
oh
yes
she
exclaimed
not
seeing
what
he
was
coming
to
oh
yes
how
could
i
how
i
care
for
him
after
after
what
has
happened
very
much
embarrassed
young
haight
went
on
i
know
it
unfair
to
take
advantage
of
you
now
but
do
you
remember
what
you
said
once
that
if
vandover
were
out
of
the
question
that
you
might
that
it
would
be
that
there
might
be
a
chance
for
me
turner
was
silent
for
a
long
time
and
then
she
said
yes
i
remember
well
how
about
that
asked
young
haight
with
a
nervous
laugh
ah
answered
turner
how
do
i
know
so
soon
but
what
do
you
turner
he
persisted
but
i
have
thought
at
all
she
returned
well
think
now
he
went
on
tell
me
how
about
that
about
ah
you
know
what
i
mean
young
haight
replied
feeling
like
a
little
boy
about
what
you
said
at
your
house
that
sunday
night
please
tell
me
you
do
know
how
much
it
means
to
me
oh

delphine
at
the
door
suddenly
exclaimed
turner
now
really
i
go
down
she
does
know
where
to
go
she
so
stupid
no
he
answered
not
until
you
tell
me
he
caught
her
hand
refusing
to
let
it
go
ah
how
mean
you
are
to
corner
me
so
she
cried
laughing
and
embarrassed
must
i
well
i
know
i
should
i
just
you
young
haight
turned
her
hand
palm
upward
and
kissed
the
little
circle
of
crumpled
flesh
that
showed
where
her
glove
buttoned
then
she
tore
her
hand
away
and
ran
downstairs
while
he
followed
more
slowly
on
her
way
back
to
the
she
met
him
again
crossing
the
hall
do
you
want
to
see
me

she
said
do

to
shouted
young
haight
oh

i
forgot
she
cried
you
ca
i
wo
let
you
you
have
your
other
dances
engaged
oh
damn
the
other
dances
he
exclaimed
but
instead
of
being
offended
turner
only
smiled
toward
one
there
was
a
general
movement
to
go
henrietta
vance
and
vance
were
inquired
for
and
the
blue
and
white
opera
cloaks
reappeared
descending
the
stairs
disturbing
the
couples
who
were
seated
there
the
banging
of
carriage
doors
and
the
rumble
of
wheels
recommenced
in
the
street
the
musicians
played
a
little
longer
as
the
party
thinned
out
there
was
greater
dance
room
and
a
consequent
greater
pleasure
in
dancing
these
last
dances
at
the
end
of
the
evening
were
enjoyed
more
than
all
the
others
but
the
party
was
breaking
up
fast
turner
had
already
gone
home
vance
and
henrietta
were
back
at
their
places
in
front
of
the
mantel
surrounded
by
a
group
of
gentlemen
in
capecoats
and
ladies
in
opera
wraps
every
one
was
crying
or
good
night
and
assuring
vance
and
henrietta
of
the
enjoyableness
of
the
occasion
suddenly
the
musicians
played
home
sweet
home
those
still
dancing
uttered
an
exclamation
of
regret
but
continued
waltzing
to
this
air
the
same
as
ever
some
began
to
dance
again
in
their
overcoats
and
opera
wraps
then
at
last
the
tired
musicians
stopped
and
reached
for
the
cases
of
their
instruments
and
the
remaining
guests
seized
with
a
sudden
panic
lest
they
should
be
the
last
to
leave
fled
to
the
these
were
in
the
greatest
confusion
every
one
was
in
a
hurry
in
the
gentlemen
there
was
a
great
putting
on
of
coats
and
mufflers
and
a
searching
for
misplaced
gloves
hats
and
canes
a
base
hum
of
talk
rose
in
the
air
bits
and
ends
of
conversation
being
tossed
back
and
forth
across
the
room
have
seen
my
hat

great
crowd
formed
in
the
halls
worming
down
the
stairs
and
out
upon
the
front
steps
as
the
first
groups
reached
the
open
air
there
was
a
great
cry
why
it
pouring
rain
this
was
taken
up
and
repeated
and
carried
all
the
way
back
into
the
house
there
were
exclamations
of
dismay
and
annoyance
why
it
raining
right
what
we
do
tempers
were
lost
brothers
and
sisters
quarrelling
with
each
other
over
the
question
of
umbrellas
ah
said
geary
delighted
peeling
the
cover
from
his
umbrella
in
the
vestibule
i
it
was
going
to
rain
before
i
left
and
brought
mine
along
with
me
ah
you
bet
i
always
look
out
for
rain
on
the
stood
the
caller
chanting
up
the
carriages
at
the
top
of
his
voice
the
street
was
full
of
coupés
carriages
and
hacks
the
raindrops
showing
in
a
golden
blur
as
they
fell
across
the
streaming
light
of
their
lamps
the
horses
were
smoking
and
restless
and
the
drivers
in
oilskins
and
rubber
blankets
were
wrangling
and
shouting
at
every
instant
there
was
a
long
roll
of
wheels
interrupted
by
the
banging
of
the
doors
near
the
caller
stood
a
useless
policeman
his
shield
pinned
on
the
outside
of
his
wet
rubber
coat
on
which
the
carriage
lamps
were
momentarily
reflected
in
long
vertical
streaks
in
a
short
time
all
the
guests
were
gone
except
the
one
young
lady
whose
maid
and
carriage
had
somehow
not
been
sent
henrietta
vance
brother
took
this
one
home
in
a
hired
hack
vance
and
henrietta
sat
down
to
rest
for
a
moment
in
the
empty
parlours
the
floors
were
littered
with
leaves
of
smilax
and
la
france
roses
with
bits
of
ribbon
ends
of
lace
and
discarded
phrygian
bonnets
of
tissue
paper
the
butler
and
the
second
girl
were
already
turning
down
the
gas
in
the
other
rooms
long
before
the
party
broke
up
vandover
had
gone
home
stunned
and
dazed
as
yet
hardly
able
to
realize
the
meaning
of
what
had
happened
some
strange
and
dreadful
change
had
taken
place
things
were
different
people
were
different
to
him
not
every
one
had
been
so
outspoken
as
turner
henrietta
vance
and
her
mother
but
even
amongst
others
who
had
talked
to
him
politely
and
courteously
enough
the
change
was
no
less
apparent
it
was
in
the
air
a
certain
vague
shrinking
and
turning
of
the
shoulder
a
general
atmosphere
of
aversion
and
repulsion
an
unseen
frown
an
unexpressed
rebuff
intangible
illusive
but
as
unmistakable
as
his
own
existence
the
world
he
had
known
knew
him
now
no
longer
it
was
ostracism
at
last
but
why
why
sitting
over
his
tiled
flamboyant
stove
brooding
into
the
winking
coals
vandover
asked
himself
the
question
in
vain
he
knew
what
latitude
young
men
were
allowed
by
society
he
was
sure
nothing
short
of
discovered
crime
could
affect
them
true
enough
he
had
at
one
time
allowed
himself
to
drift
into
considerable
dissipation
but
he
was
done
with
that
now
he
had
reformed
he
had
turned
over
a
new
leaf
even
at
his
worst
he
had
only
lived
the
life
of
the
other
young
men
around
him
the
other
young
men
who
were
received
as
much
as
ever
even
though
people
the
girls
themselves
practically
knew
of
what
they
did
knew
that
they
were
often
drunk
and
that
they
frequented
the
society
of
abandoned
women
what
had
he
done
to
merit
this
casting
off
what
he
have
done
he
even
went
so
far
as
to
wonder
if
there
was
anything
wrong
about
his
father
or
his
sudden
death
a
little
after
one
he
heard
geary
whistle
in
the
street
outside
hello
old
man
he
cried
as
vandover
opened
the
window
i
was
just
on
my
way
home
from
the
saw
a
light
in
your
window
and
thought
i
call
you
up
say
have
you
got
anything
wet
up
there
i
extra
dry
yes
said
vandover
come
on
up
did
you
hear
what
beale
said
to
me
this
evening
said
geary
as
he
mixed
himself
a
cocktail
at
the
sideboard
oh
i
tell
you
i
getting
right
in
down
at
that
office
beale
wants
me
to
take
the
place
of
one
of
the
assistants
in
the
firm
a
fellow
who
got
the
consumption
coughing
up
his
lungs
all
the
time
it
an
important
place
hundred
a
month
that
right
yes
sir
you
bet
i
going
to
get
in
and
rustle
now
and
make
myself
so
indispensable
in
that
fellow
place
that
they
ca
get
along
without
me
i
crowd
him
right
out
i
know
it
may
be
selfish
but
damn
it
that
what
you
have
to
do
to
get
along
human
nature
i
tell
you
right
here
he
exclaimed
with
sudden
energy
clenching
his
fist
and
slowly
rapping
the
knuckles
on
the
table
to
emphasize
each
word
that
i
be
the
head
of
that
firm
some
day
or
i
know
the
reason
why
when
geary
finally
became
silent
the
two
looked
into
the
fire
for
some
time
without
speaking
at
last
geary
said
you
came
home
early
did
you
yes
answered
vandover
stirring
uneasily
yes
i
did
there
was
another
silence
then
geary
said
abruptly
it
too
bad
they
are
kind
of
to
you
yes
said
vandover
with
a
grin
do
know
what
the
matter
everybody
seems
nasty
it
that
business
with
ida
wade
you
know
replied
geary
it
got
around
somehow
that
she
killed
herself
on
your
account
everybody
seems
to
be
on
to
it
i
heard
it
oh
nearly
a
month
ago
oh
said
vandover
with
a
short
laugh
that
it
is
it
i
was
wondering
yes
that
it
answered
geary
you
see
they
do
know
for
sure
no
one
but
all
at
once
every
one
seemed
to
be
talking
about
it
and
they
suspect
an
awful
lot
i
guess
they
are
pretty
near
right
are
they
he
did
not
wait
for
an
answer
but
laughed
clumsily
and
went
on
you
see
you
always
have
to
be
awfully
careful
in
those
things
or
you
get
into
a
box
ah
you
bet
i
do
let
any
girl
go
with
know
last
name
or
address
if
i
can
help
it
i
clever
enough
for
that
you
have
to
manage
very
carefully
ah
you
bet
you
ought
to
have
looked
out
for
that
old
man
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
oh
i
guess
it
will
be
all
right
all
right
in
a
little
while
they
will
forget
about
it
you
know
i
would
worry
i
guess
it
will
be
all
right
yes
answered
vandover
absently
i
guess
so
perhaps
a
few
days
later
vandover
was
in
the
of
the
mechanics
library
listlessly
turning
over
the
pages
of
a
volume
of
it
was
saturday
morning
and
the
place
was
full
of
ladies
who
were
downtown
for
their
shopping
and
marketing
and
who
had
come
in
either
to
change
their
books
or
to
keep
appointments
with
each
other
on
a
sudden
vandover
saw
turner
just
passing
into
the
biography
alcove
he
got
up
and
followed
her
she
was
standing
at
the
end
of
the
dim
tunnel
searching
the
upper
shelves
her
head
and
throat
bent
back
and
her
gloved
finger
on
her
lip
the
faint
odour
of
the
perfume
she
always
affected
came
to
him
mingled
with
the
fragrance
of
the
jonquils
at
her
belt
and
the
smell
of
leather
and
of
books
that
exhaled
from
the
shelves
on
either
side
he
did
not
offer
to
take
her
hand
but
came
up
slowly
speaking
in
a
low
voice
it
was
the
last
time
that
vandover
ever
met
turner
ravis
they
talked
for
upward
of
an
hour
leaning
against
the
opposite
vandover
with
his
fists
in
his
pockets
his
head
bent
down
and
the
point
of
his
shoe
tracing
the
pattern
in
the
linoleum
carpet
turner
her
hands
clasped
in
front
of
her
looking
him
squarely
in
the
face
speaking
calmly
and
frankly
now
i
hope
you
see
just
how
it
is
van
she
said
at
length
what
has
happened
has
made
me
cease
to
care
for
you
because
if
i
had
really
cared
for
you
the
way
i
thought
i
did
the
way
a
girl
ought
to
care
for
the
man
she
wants
to
marry
i
would
have
stood
by
you
through
everything
no
matter
what
you
did
i
do
do
so
now
because
i
find
i
do
care
for
you
as
much
as
i
thought
i
did
what
has
happened
has
only
shown
me
that
i
sorry
oh
so
sorry
to
be
disappointed
in
you
but
it
because
i
only
think
of
you
as
being
once
a
very
good
friend
of
mine
not
because
i
love
you
as
you
think
i
did
once
a
long
time
ago
when
we
first
knew
each
other
then
perhaps
things
were
different
then
but
somehow
we
seem
to
have
grown
away
from
that
since
then
we
have
both
been
mistaken
you
thought
i
cared
for
you
in
that
way
and
i
thought
so
too
and
i
thought
you
cared
for
me
but
it
was
only
that
we
were
keeping
up
appearances
pretending
to
ourselves
just
for
the
sake
of
old
times
we
do
love
each
other
now
you
know
it
but
i
have
never
intentionally
deceived
you
or
tried
to
lead
you
on
when
i
told
you
i
cared
for
you
i
really
thought
i
did
i
meant
to
be
sincere
i
always
thought
so
until
this
happened
and
then
when
i
saw
how
easily
i
could
let
you
go
it
only
proved
to
me
that
i
did
not
care
for
you
as
i
thought
i
did
it
was
wrong
of
me
i
know
and
i
should
have
known
my
own
mind
before
but
i
did
i
did
you
talk
about
dolly
haight
but
it
is
not
dolly
haight
at
all
who
has
changed
my
affection
for
you
i
will
be
just
as
frank
as
i
can
with
you
van
i
may
learn
really
to
love
dolly
haight
i
do
know
i
think
perhaps
i
will
but
it
that
i
care
for
him
because
i
do
care
for
you
ca
you
see
it
just
as
if
i
had
never
met
you
you
know
it
very
hard
for
me
to
say
this
to
you
van
and
i
suppose
it
all
mixed
up
but
i
ca
help
it
you
do
know
how
sorry
i
am
because
we
have
been
such
old
friends
because
i
really
did
care
for
you
as
a
friend
it
a
proof
of
it
that
there
is
no
other
man
in
the
world
i
could
talk
to
like
this
i
think
too
van
that
was
the
only
way
you
cared
for
me
just
as
a
good
friend
except
perhaps
at
first
when
we
first
knew
each
other
you
know
yourself
that
is
so
we
really
have
loved
each
other
at
all
for
a
long
time
and
now
we
have
found
it
out
before
it
was
too
late
and
even
if
everything
were
different
van
do
you
know
how
it
is
with
girls
they
really
love
the
man
who
loves
them
the
most
half
the
time
just
in
love
with
being
loved
that
the
way
most
girls
love
nowadays
and
you
know
yourself
van
that
dolly
haight
really
loves
me
more
than
you
do
she
gathered
up
her
books
and
went
on
after
a
pause
straightening
up
ready
to
go
if
i
should
let
myself
think
of
what
you
have
done
i
feel
as
if
as
if
why
dreadful
i
that
i
should
hate
you
loathe
you
but
i
try
not
to
do
that
i
have
been
thinking
it
all
over
since
the
other
night
i
shall
always
try
to
think
of
you
at
your
best
i
have
tried
to
forget
everything
else
and
in
forgetting
it
i
forgive
you
i
can
honestly
say
that
she
said
holding
out
her
hand
i
forgive
you
and
you
must
forgive
me
because
once
by
deceiving
myself
i
deceived
you
and
made
you
think
that
i
cared
for
you
in
that
way
when
i
did
as
their
hands
fell
apart
turner
faced
him
and
added
with
tears
in
her
eyes
you
know
this
must
be
for
good
you
do
know
how
it
hurts
me
to
tell
you
i
know
it
looks
as
if
i
were
deserting
you
when
you
were
alone
in
the
world
and
had
most
need
of
some
one
to
influence
you
for
the
good
but
van
wo
you
be
better
now
wo
you
break
from
it
all
and
be
your
own
self
again
i
have
faith
in
you
i
believe
it
in
you
to
become
a
great
man
and
a
good
man
it
is
too
late
to
begin
all
over
again
just
be
your
better
self
live
up
to
the
best
that
in
you
if
not
for
your
own
sake
then
for
the
sake
of
that
other
girl
that
coming
into
your
life
some
time
that
other
girl
who
is
good
and
sweet
and
pure
whom
you
will
really
really
love
and
who
will
really
really
love
you
all
the
rest
of
that
month
vandover
was
wretched
so
great
was
his
shame
and
humiliation
over
this
fresh
disaster
that
he
hardly
dared
to
show
himself
out
of
doors
his
grief
was
genuine
and
it
was
profound
yet
he
took
his
punishment
in
the
right
spirit
he
did
not
blame
any
one
but
himself
it
was
only
a
just
retribution
for
the
thing
he
had
done
only
what
made
it
hard
to
bear
was
the
fact
that
the
chastisement
had
fallen
upon
him
long
after
he
had
repented
of
the
crime
long
after
he
had
resolved
to
lead
a
new
and
upright
life
but
with
shut
teeth
he
determined
still
to
carry
out
that
resolve
he
would
devote
all
his
future
life
to
living
down
the
past
it
might
be
hard
it
might
be
one
long
struggle
through
many
many
years
but
he
would
do
it
ah
yes
he
would
show
them
they
had
cast
him
off
but
he
would
go
away
to
paris
now
as
he
had
always
intended
as
invariably
happened
when
he
was
deeply
moved
he
turned
to
his
art
blindly
and
instinctively
he
would
go
to
paris
now
and
study
his
paintings
five
ten
years
and
come
back
at
last
a
great
artist
when
these
same
people
who
had
cast
him
off
would
be
proud
to
receive
him
turner
was
right
in
saying
that
he
had
in
him
the
making
of
a
great
man
he
that
she
was
right
knew
that
if
he
only
gave
the
better
part
of
him
the
other
vandover
the
chance
that
he
would
become
a
great
artist
well
he
would
do
so
and
then
when
he
came
back
again
when
all
the
world
was
at
his
feet
and
there
were
long
articles
in
the
paper
announcing
his
arrival
these
people
would
throng
around
him
he
would
show
them
what
a
great
and
noble
nature
he
really
had
he
would
forgive
them
he
would
ignore
what
they
had
done
he
even
dramatized
a
little
scene
between
himself
and
turner
then
haight
they
would
both
be
pretty
old
then
and
he
would
take
her
children
on
his
lap
and
look
at
her
over
their
heads
he
could
almost
see
those
heads
white
silky
and
very
soft
and
he
would
nod
at
her
thoughtfully
and
say
well
i
have
taken
your
advice
do
you
remember
and
she
was
to
answer
yes
i
remember
there
were
actually
tears
in
his
eyes
as
he
saw
the
scene
at
the
very
first
he
thought
that
he
could
not
live
without
turner
that
he
loved
her
too
much
to
be
able
to
give
her
up
but
in
a
little
while
he
saw
that
this
was
not
so
she
was
right
too
in
saying
that
he
had
long
since
outlived
his
first
sincere
affection
for
her
he
had
felt
for
a
long
time
that
he
did
not
love
her
well
enough
to
marry
her
that
he
did
not
love
her
as
young
haight
did
and
he
acknowledged
to
himself
that
this
affair
at
least
had
ended
rightly
the
two
loved
each
other
he
could
see
that
at
last
he
even
told
himself
that
he
would
be
glad
to
see
turner
married
to
dolly
haight
who
was
his
best
friend
but
for
all
that
it
came
very
hard
at
first
to
give
up
turner
altogether
never
to
see
her
or
speak
to
her
again
as
the
first
impressions
of
the
whole
affair
grew
dull
and
blunt
by
the
lapse
of
time
this
humble
penitential
mood
of
vandover
passed
away
and
was
succeeded
by
a
feeling
of
gloomy
revolt
a
sullen
rage
at
the
world
that
had
cast
him
off
because
he
had
been
found
out
he
thought
it
a
matter
of
to
resent
the
insult
they
had
put
upon
him
but
little
by
little
he
ceased
to
regret
his
exile
the
new
life
was
not
so
bad
as
he
had
at
first
anticipated
and
his
relations
with
the
men
whom
he
knew
best
ellis
geary
and
young
haight
were
in
nowise
changed
he
was
no
longer
invited
anywhere
and
the
girls
he
had
known
never
saw
him
when
he
passed
them
on
the
street
it
was
humiliating
enough
at
first
but
he
got
used
to
it
after
a
while
and
by
dint
of
thrusting
the
disagreeable
subject
from
his
thoughts
by
refusing
to
let
the
disgrace
sink
deep
in
his
mind
by
forgetting
the
whole
business
as
much
as
he
could
he
arrived
after
a
time
to
be
passably
contented
his
pliable
character
had
again
rearranged
itself
to
suit
the
new
environment
along
with
this
however
came
a
sense
of
freedom
now
he
no
longer
had
anything
to
fear
from
society
it
had
shot
its
bolt
it
had
done
its
worst
there
was
no
longer
anything
to
restrain
him
now
he
could
do
anything
he
was
in
precisely
this
state
of
mind
when
he
received
the
cards
for
the
opening
of
the
roadhouse
the
resort
out
on
the
almshouse
drive
about
which
toby
the
waiter
at
the
imperial
had
spoken
to
him
vandover
attended
it
it
was
a
debauch
of
hours
the
longest
and
the
worst
he
had
ever
indulged
in
for
a
long
time
the
brute
had
been
numb
and
dormant
now
at
last
when
he
woke
he
was
raging
more
insatiable
more
irresistible
than
ever
the
affair
at
the
roadhouse
was
but
the
beginning
all
at
once
vandover
rushed
into
a
career
of
dissipation
consumed
with
the
desire
of
vice
the
perverse
blind
and
reckless
desire
of
the
male
drunkenness
sensuality
gambling
debauchery
he
knew
them
all
he
rubbed
elbows
with
street
walkers
with
bookmakers
with
saloonkeepers
with
the
exploiters
of
lost
women
the
bartenders
of
the
city
called
him
by
his
first
name
the
policemen
the
night
detail
were
familiar
with
his
face
the
drivers
of
the
nighthawks
recognized
his
figure
by
the
street
lamps
paling
in
the
light
of
many
an
early
dawn
at
one
time
and
another
he
was
associated
with
all
the
different
types
of
people
in
the
low
sporting
set
acquaintances
of
an
evening
whose
names
grew
faint
to
his
recollection
amidst
the
jingle
of
glasses
and
the
popping
of
corks
whose
faces
faded
from
his
memory
in
the
haze
of
tobacco
smoke
and
the
fumes
of
whisky
young
men
of
the
city
rich
without
apparent
means
of
livelihood
women
and
girls
recently
from
the
east
with
rooms
over
the
fast
restaurants
owners
of
trotting
horses
actresses
without
engagements
and
the
sons
of
the
proprietors
of
halfway
houses
and
resorts
with
all
these
vandover
kept
the
pace
at
the
imperial
at
the
at
the
gambling
tables
in
the
saloons
and
bars
along
kearney
and
market
streets
and
in
the
disreputable
houses
amid
the
strong
odours
of
musk
and
the
rustle
of
heavy
silk
dresses
it
lasted
for
a
year
by
the
end
of
that
time
he
had
about
forgotten
his
determination
to
go
to
paris
and
had
grown
out
of
touch
with
his
three
old
friends
ellis
geary
and
haight
he
seldom
saw
them
now
occasionally
he
met
them
in
one
of
the
little
rooms
of
the
imperial
over
their
beer
and
welsh
rabbits
but
now
he
always
went
on
to
the
larger
rooms
where
one
had
champagne
and
terrapin
he
felt
that
he
no
longer
was
one
of
them
that
year
the
opera
came
to
san
francisco
and
vandover
hired
a
messenger
boy
to
stand
in
line
all
night
at
the
door
of
the
music
store
where
the
tickets
were
to
be
sold
vandover
could
still
love
music
in
the
wreckage
of
all
that
was
good
that
had
been
going
on
in
him
his
love
for
all
art
was
yet
intact
it
was
the
strongest
side
of
his
nature
and
it
would
be
the
last
to
go
chapter
fourteen
the
house
was
crowded
to
the
doors
there
was
no
longer
any
standing
room
and
many
were
even
sitting
on
the
steps
of
the
aisles
in
the
boxes
the
gentlemen
were
standing
up
behind
the
chairs
of
large
plain
ladies
in
showy
toilets
and
diamonds
the
atmosphere
was
heavy
with
the
smell
of
gas
of
plush
upholstery
of
wilting
bouquets
and
of
sachet
a
fine
vapour
as
of
the
visible
exhalation
of
many
breaths
pervaded
the
house
blurring
the
lowered
lights
and
dimming
the
splendour
of
the
great
glass
chandelier
it
was
warm
to
suffocation
a
dry
irritating
warmth
that
perspiration
did
not
relieve
while
the
air
itself
was
stale
and
close
as
though
fouled
by
being
breathed
over
and
over
again
in
the
topmost
galleries
banked
with
tiers
of
watching
faces
the
heat
must
have
been
unbearable
the
only
movement
perceptible
throughout
the
audience
was
the
little
swaying
of
fans
like
the
balancing
of
butterflies
about
to
light
occasionally
there
would
be
a
vast
rustling
like
the
sound
of
wind
in
a
forest
as
the
holders
of
librettos
turned
the
leaves
simultaneously
the
orchestra
thundered
the
french
horns
snarling
the
first
violins
wailing
in
unison
while
all
the
bows
went
up
and
down
together
like
parts
of
a
machine
the
rolled
sonorously
at
exact
intervals
and
now
and
then
one
heard
the
tinkling
of
the
harp
like
the
pattering
of
raindrops
between
peals
of
thunder
the
leader
swayed
from
side
to
side
in
his
place
beating
time
with
his
baton
his
hand
and
his
head
on
the
stage
itself
the
act
was
drawing
to
a
close
there
had
just
been
a
duel
the
baritone
lay
stretched
upon
the
floor
at
left
centre
his
sword
fallen
at
some
paces
from
him
on
the
left
of
the
scene
front
stood
the
tenor
who
had
killed
him
singing
in
his
highest
register
very
red
in
the
face
continually
striking
his
hand
upon
his
breast
and
pointing
with
his
sword
toward
his
fallen
enemy
next
him
on
the
extreme
left
was
his
friend
the
basso
in
high
leather
boots
growling
from
time
to
time
during
a
sustained
chord
honneur
et
ma
in
the
centre
of
the
stage
the
soprano
the
star
the
prima
donna
chanted
a
fervid
but
ineffectual
appeal
to
the
tenor
who
cried
jamais
striking
his
breast
and
pointing
with
his
sword
the
prima
donna
cried
mon
dieu
ayez
pitié
de
her
confidante
the
came
to
her
support
repeating
her
words
with
an
impersonal
meaning
pitié
honneur
et
ma
growled
the
basso
the
contralto
dressed
as
a
man
turned
toward
the
audience
on
the
extreme
right
bringing
out
her
notes
with
a
wrench
and
a
twist
of
her
body
and
neck
and
intoning
malheureuse
mon
dieu
ayez
pitié
the
leader
of
the
chorus
costumed
as
the
captain
of
the
watch
leaned
over
the
dead
baritone
and
sang
est
mort
il
est
mort
mon
dieu
ayez
pitié
de
the
soldiers
of
the
watch
were
huddled
together
immediately
back
of
him
they
wore
tin
helmets
much
too
large
and
green
peplums
and
repeated
his
words
continually
the
chorus
itself
was
made
up
of
citizens
of
the
town
it
was
in
a
semicircle
at
the
back
of
the
stage
the
men
on
one
side
the
women
on
the
other
they
made
all
their
gestures
together
and
chanted
without
ceasing
horreur
o
mystére
il
est
mort
mon
dieu
ayez
pitié
de
nous
grace
cried
the
prima
donna
jamais
echoed
the
tenor
striking
his
breast
and
pointing
with
his
sword
mystére
chanted
the
chorus
while
the
basso
struck
his
hand
upon
his
sword
hilt
growling
honneur
et
ma
the
orchestra
redoubled
the
finale
began
all
the
pieces
of
the
orchestra
all
the
voices
on
the
stage
commenced
over
again
very
loud
they
all
took
a
step
forward
and
the
rhythm
became
more
rapid
till
it
reached
a
climax
where
the
prima
donna
voice
jumped
to
a
c
in
alt
holding
it
long
enough
for
the
basso
to
thunder
honneur
et
ma
twice
then
they
all
struck
the
attitudes
for
the
closing
tableau
and
in
one
last
burst
of
music
sang
all
together
dieu
ayez
pitié
de
and
and
and
then
the
orchestra
closed
with
a
long
roll
of
the
and
the
prima
donna
fainted
into
the
arms
of
her
confidante
the
curtain
fell
there
was
a
roar
of
applause
the
gallery
whistled
and
stamped
every
one
relaxed
his
or
her
position
drawing
a
long
breath
looking
about
there
was
a
general
stir
the
lights
in
the
great
glass
chandelier
clicked
and
blazed
up
and
a
murmur
of
conversation
arose
the
footlights
were
lowered
and
the
orchestra
left
their
places
and
disappeared
underneath
the
stage
leaving
the
audience
with
the
conviction
that
they
had
gone
out
after
beer
all
over
the
house
one
heard
the
shrill
voices
of
boys
crying
out
books
books
for
the
words
and
music
for
the
throughout
the
boxes
a
great
coming
and
going
took
place
and
an
interchange
of
visits
the
gentlemen
out
in
the
foyer
stood
about
conversing
in
groups
or
walked
up
and
down
smoking
cigarettes
often
pausing
in
front
of
the
big
floral
piece
that
was
to
be
given
to
the
prima
donna
at
the
end
of
the
great
scene
in
the
fourth
act
there
was
a
little
titter
of
an
electric
bell
the
curtain
was
about
to
go
up
and
a
great
rush
for
seats
began
the
orchestra
were
coming
back
and
tuning
up
they
sent
up
a
prolonged
medley
of
sounds
little
minor
chirps
and
cries
from
the
violins
liquid
runs
and
mellow
gurgles
from
the
oboes
flutes
and
instruments
and
an
occasional
purring
from
the
bass
viols
a
bell
rang
faintly
from
behind
the
wings
the
house
lights
sank
and
the
footlights
blazed
up
the
leader
tapped
with
his
baton
a
great
silence
fell
upon
the
house
while
here
and
there
one
heard
an
energetic
ssh
ssh
the
fourth
act
was
about
to
begin
when
the
curtain
rose
on
the
fourth
act
one
saw
the
prima
donna
standing
in
a
very
dejected
pose
in
the
midst
of
a
vast
apartment
that
might
have
been
a
bedchamber
a
council
hall
or
a
hall
of
audience
she
was
alone
she
wore
a
loose
gown
knotted
about
the
waist
her
arms
were
bare
and
her
hair
unbound
and
flowing
loose
over
her
shoulders
to
her
girdle
she
was
to
die
in
this
act
it
promised
to
be
harrowing
and
the
first
few
notes
she
uttered
recurred
again
later
on
as
the
motif
for
the
famous
quartet
in
the
great
scene
but
for
all
this
the
music
had
little
by
little
taken
possession
of
vandover
and
little
by
little
he
had
forgotten
his
surroundings
the
stifling
air
of
the
house
the
blinding
glitter
of
the
stage
and
the
discomfort
of
his
limbs
cramped
into
the
narrow
orchestra
chair
all
music
was
music
to
him
he
loved
it
with
an
unreasoned
uncritical
love
enjoying
even
the
barrel
organs
and
hand
pianos
of
the
streets
for
the
present
the
slow
beat
and
cadence
of
the
melodies
of
the
opera
had
cradled
all
his
senses
carrying
him
away
into
a
kind
of
exalted
dream
the
quartet
began
for
him
it
was
wonderfully
sweet
the
chords
breathing
over
the
subdued
orchestral
accompaniment
like
some
sweet
south
wind
passing
in
long
sighs
over
the
pulse
of
a
great
ocean
it
seemed
to
him
infinitely
beautiful
infinitely
sad
subdued
minor
plaints
recurring
persistently
again
and
again
like
sighs
of
parting
but
could
not
be
restrained
like
voices
of
regret
for
the
things
that
were
never
to
be
again
or
it
was
a
pathos
a
joy
in
all
things
good
a
vast
tenderness
so
sweet
so
divinely
pure
that
it
could
not
be
framed
in
words
so
great
and
so
deep
that
it
found
its
only
expression
in
tears
there
came
over
him
a
vague
sense
of
those
things
which
are
too
beautiful
to
be
comprehended
of
a
nobility
a
an
immortal
eternal
love
and
kindness
all
goodness
all
benignity
all
pity
for
sin
all
sorrow
for
grief
all
joy
for
the
true
the
right
and
the
pure
to
be
better
to
be
true
and
right
and
pure
these
were
the
only
things
that
were
worth
while
these
were
the
things
that
he
seemed
to
feel
in
the
music
it
was
as
if
for
the
moment
he
had
become
a
little
child
again
not
ashamed
to
be
innocent
ignorant
of
vice
still
believing
in
all
his
illusions
still
near
to
the
great
white
gates
of
life
the
appeal
had
been
made
directly
to
what
was
best
and
strongest
in
vandover
and
the
answer
was
quick
and
all
the
good
that
still
survived
in
him
leaped
to
life
again
in
an
instant
clamouring
for
recognition
pleading
for
existence
the
other
vandover
the
better
vandover
wrestled
with
the
brute
in
him
once
more
never
before
so
strong
never
so
persistent
he
had
not
yet
destroyed
all
that
was
good
in
him
now
it
had
turned
in
one
more
revolt
crying
out
against
him
protesting
for
the
last
time
against
its
own
perversion
and
destruction
vandover
felt
that
he
was
at
the
great
crisis
of
his
life
after
all
was
over
he
walked
home
through
the
silent
streets
proceeding
slowly
his
hands
in
his
pockets
his
head
bent
down
his
mind
very
busy
once
in
his
rooms
he
threw
off
his
things
and
having
stirred
up
the
drowsing
fire
in
the
tiled
stove
sat
down
before
it
in
his
the
bosom
of
his
full
dress
shirt
bulging
from
his
vest
and
faintly
creaking
as
from
time
to
time
he
drew
a
long
breath
he
had
been
lured
into
a
mood
where
he
was
himself
at
his
very
best
where
the
other
vandover
the
better
vandover
drew
apart
with
eyes
turned
askance
looking
inward
and
downward
into
the
depths
of
his
own
character
shuddering
terrified
far
down
there
in
the
darkest
lowest
places
he
had
seen
the
brute
squat
deformed
hideous
he
had
seen
it
crawling
to
and
fro
dimly
through
a
dark
shadow
he
had
heard
it
growling
chafing
at
the
least
restraint
restless
to
be
free
for
now
at
last
it
was
huge
strong
insatiable
swollen
and
distorted
out
of
all
size
grown
to
be
a
monster
glutted
yet
still
ravenous
some
fearful
bestial
satyr
grovelling
perverse
horrible
beyond
words
and
with
the
eyes
of
this
better
self
he
saw
again
little
by
little
the
course
of
his
whole
life
and
witnessed
again
the
eternal
struggle
between
good
and
evil
that
had
been
going
on
within
him
since
his
very
earliest
years
he
was
sure
that
at
the
first
the
good
had
been
the
strongest
little
by
little
the
brute
had
grown
and
he
adapting
himself
to
every
change
of
environment
luxurious
shrinking
with
the
shrinking
of
a
sensuous
from
all
that
was
irksome
and
disagreeable
had
shut
his
ears
to
the
voices
that
shouted
warnings
of
the
danger
and
had
allowed
the
brute
to
thrive
and
to
grow
its
abominable
famine
gorged
from
the
store
of
that
in
him
which
he
felt
to
be
the
purest
the
cleanest
and
the
best
its
bulk
fattened
upon
the
rot
and
the
decay
of
all
that
was
good
growing
larger
day
by
day
noisome
swollen
poddy
a
filthy
inordinate
ghoul
gorged
and
bloated
by
feeding
on
the
good
things
that
were
dead
besides
this
he
saw
how
one
by
one
he
had
wrenched
himself
free
from
all
those
influences
that
had
tended
to
foster
and
to
cultivate
all
the
better
part
of
him
first
of
all
long
ago
it
seemed
now
he
had
allowed
to
be
destroyed
that
first
instinctive
purity
that
fragile
delicate
innocence
which
dies
young
in
almost
every
human
being
and
that
one
sees
evaporating
under
the
earliest
taint
of
vice
with
a
smile
partly
of
contempt
partly
of
pity
partly
of
genuine
regret
next
it
had
been
his
father
the
old
gentleman
had
exerted
a
great
influence
over
vandover
he
had
never
forgotten
that
scene
the
morning
after
he
had
told
him
of
his
measure
of
responsibility
in
ida
suicide
the
recovery
from
the
first
shock
of
dazed
bewilderment
and
then
the
forgiveness
the
solicitude
and
the
encouragement
to
begin
over
again
to
live
it
down
and
to
do
that
which
was
right
and
good
and
true
not
only
had
he
stopped
his
ears
to
this
voice
but
also
something
told
him
he
had
done
much
to
silence
it
forever
despite
the
old
apparent
fortitude
the
blow
must
have
carried
home
what
must
he
not
have
suffered
during
those
long
weeks
while
vandover
was
away
what
lonely
broodings
in
the
empty
house
and
then
the
news
of
the
wreck
the
days
of
suspense
it
all
must
have
told
the
old
gentleman
was
not
strong
vandover
could
not
but
feel
that
he
had
hastened
his
death
and
that
in
so
doing
he
had
destroyed
another
influence
which
would
have
cultivated
and
fostered
his
better
self
would
have
made
it
strong
against
the
attacks
of
the
brute
the
other
person
who
had
helped
to
bring
out
all
that
was
best
in
vandover
had
been
turner
ravis
there
was
no
denying
that
when
he
had
first
known
her
he
had
loved
her
sincerely
things
were
vastly
different
with
him
when
turner
had
been
his
companion
things
that
were
unworthy
that
were
low
that
were
impure
and
vicious
did
not
seem
worth
while
then
not
only
did
they
have
no
attraction
for
him
but
he
even
shunned
and
avoided
them
he
knew
he
was
a
better
man
for
loving
her
invariably
she
made
him
wish
to
be
better
but
little
by
little
as
he
frequented
the
society
of
such
girls
as
ida
wade
grace
irving
and
flossie
his
affection
for
turner
faded
as
the
habits
of
passionate
and
unhealthy
excitement
grew
upon
him
he
lost
first
the
taste
and
then
the
very
capacity
for
a
calm
pure
feeling
his
affection
for
her
he
frittered
away
with
fast
girls
and
abandoned
women
strangled
it
in
the
foul
air
of
disreputable
houses
dragged
and
defiled
it
in
the
of
the
imperial
in
the
end
he
had
quite
destroyed
it
wilfully
wantonly
killed
it
as
turner
herself
had
said
she
could
only
be
in
love
with
being
loved
her
affection
for
him
had
dwindled
as
well
at
last
they
had
come
to
be
indifferent
to
each
other
she
no
longer
inspired
him
to
be
better
and
thus
he
had
shaken
off
this
good
influence
as
well
public
opinion
had
been
a
great
check
upon
him
the
fear
of
scandal
the
desire
to
stand
well
with
the
world
he
knew
trivial
though
he
felt
it
to
be
the
dread
of
what
people
would
say
had
to
a
great
extent
held
vandover
back
he
had
a
position
to
maintain
a
reputation
to
keep
up
in
the
parlours
and
at
the
dinner
tables
where
he
was
received
it
could
not
be
denied
that
society
had
influenced
vandover
for
good
but
this
too
like
all
the
others
he
had
cast
from
him
now
he
was
ostracized
society
cared
no
longer
what
he
did
his
position
was
gone
his
reputation
was
destroyed
there
was
no
one
now
to
stand
in
his
way
vandover
could
not
fall
back
on
any
religious
influence
religion
had
never
affected
him
very
deeply
it
was
true
that
he
had
been
baptized
confirmed
and
had
gone
to
church
with
considerable
regularity
if
he
had
been
asked
if
he
was
a
christian
and
believed
in
god
he
would
have
answered
certainly
certainly
until
the
time
of
his
father
death
he
had
even
said
his
prayers
every
night
the
last
thing
before
turning
out
the
gas
sitting
upon
the
edge
of
his
bed
in
his
his
head
in
both
his
hands
he
added
to
the
lord
prayer
certain
other
petitions
as
to
those
who
were
in
trouble
sorrow
poverty
or
any
other
privations
he
asked
for
blessings
upon
his
father
and
upon
himself
praying
for
the
former
health
and
prosperity
and
for
himself
that
he
might
become
a
great
artist
that
the
last
enemy
might
be
admitted
to
the
salon
when
he
had
painted
it
and
that
it
might
make
him
famous
but
as
a
rule
vandover
thought
very
little
about
religious
matters
and
when
he
did
told
himself
that
he
was
too
intelligent
to
believe
in
a
literal
heaven
a
literal
hell
and
a
personal
god
personally
interfering
in
human
affairs
like
any
jove
or
odin
but
the
moment
he
rejected
a
concrete
religion
vandover
was
almost
helpless
he
was
not
mystic
enough
to
find
any
meaning
in
signs
or
symbols
nor
philosophic
enough
to
grasp
vague
and
immense
abstractions
infinities
presences
forces
could
not
help
him
withstand
temptation
could
not
strengthen
him
against
the
brute
he
felt
that
somewhere
some
time
there
was
punishment
for
evildoing
but
as
happened
in
the
case
of
ida
wade
death
to
dwell
on
such
thoughts
disturbed
and
terrified
him
he
did
not
dare
to
look
long
in
that
direction
conscience
remorse
repentance
all
these
had
been
keen
enough
at
first
but
he
had
so
persistently
kicked
against
the
pricks
that
little
by
little
he
had
ceased
to
feel
them
at
all
then
an
immense
and
overwhelming
terror
seized
upon
him
was
there
nothing
then
nothing
left
which
he
could
lay
hold
of
to
save
him
he
knew
that
he
could
not
deliver
himself
by
his
own
exertions
religion
could
not
help
him
he
had
killed
his
father
estranged
the
girl
he
might
have
loved
outraged
the
world
and
at
a
single
breath
blighted
the
fine
innate
purity
of
his
early
years
it
was
as
if
he
had
entered
into
his
life
in
the
world
as
into
some
vast
labyrinth
wandering
on
aimlessly
flinging
from
him
one
by
one
the
threads
the
clues
that
might
have
led
him
again
to
a
safe
exit
going
down
deeper
and
deeper
until
when
near
the
centre
he
had
suddenly
felt
the
presence
of
the
brute
had
heard
its
loathsome
muttering
growl
had
at
last
seen
it
far
down
at
the
end
of
a
passage
dimly
and
in
a
dark
shadow
terrified
he
had
started
back
looking
wildly
about
for
any
avenue
of
escape
searching
with
frantic
haste
and
eagerness
for
any
one
of
those
clues
he
had
so
carelessly
cast
from
him
realizing
that
without
such
guidance
he
would
inevitably
tend
down
again
to
that
fatal
central
place
where
the
brute
had
its
lair
there
was
nothing
nothing
he
clearly
saw
the
fate
toward
which
he
was
hurrying
it
was
not
too
late
to
save
himself
if
he
only
could
find
help
but
he
could
find
help
his
terror
increased
almost
to
hysteria
it
was
one
of
those
dreadful
moments
that
men
sometimes
undergo
that
must
be
met
alone
and
that
when
past
remain
in
the
memory
for
all
time
a
glimpse
far
down
into
the
springs
and
wheels
of
life
a
glimpse
that
does
not
come
often
lest
the
reason
brought
to
the
edge
of
the
fearful
gulf
should
grow
dizzy
at
the
sight
and
reeling
topple
headlong
but
suddenly
vandover
rose
to
his
feet
the
tears
came
to
his
eyes
and
with
a
long
breath
he
exclaimed
thank
god
for
it
he
grew
calmer
in
a
moment
the
crisis
had
passed
he
had
found
a
clue
beneath
his
groping
fingers
he
had
remembered
his
art
turning
to
it
instinctively
as
he
always
did
when
greatly
moved
this
was
the
one
good
thing
that
yet
survived
it
was
the
strongest
side
of
him
it
would
be
the
last
to
go
he
felt
it
there
yet
it
was
the
one
thing
that
could
save
him
the
thought
had
come
to
him
so
suddenly
and
with
such
marvellous
clearness
that
in
his
present
exalted
state
of
mind
it
filled
him
with
a
vague
sense
of
awe
it
seemed
like
a
manifestation
a
writing
on
the
wall
might
it
not
be
some
sort
of
miracle
he
had
heard
of
men
reforming
their
lives
transformed
almost
in
an
instant
and
had
scoffed
at
the
idea
but
might
it
not
be
true
after
all
what
was
this
wonderful
thing
that
had
happened
to
him
was
this
less
strange
than
a
miracle
less
divine
the
following
day
vandover
rented
a
studio
it
was
the
lofty
room
with
hardwood
floors
and
the
immense
north
light
in
that
suite
which
he
had
rejected
when
looking
for
rooms
on
the
former
occasion
he
gave
notice
to
the
clerk
in
the
apartment
house
where
his
quarters
were
situated
that
he
intended
to
vacate
after
the
first
of
the
month
charming
as
he
had
found
these
rooms
he
gave
up
with
scarcely
a
regret
the
idea
of
living
in
them
any
longer
in
a
month
it
would
be
summer
and
he
would
be
on
his
way
to
paris
but
so
great
was
his
desire
for
work
now
so
eager
was
he
to
start
the
last
enemy
so
strong
was
the
new
energy
that
shook
him
that
vandover
could
not
wait
until
summer
to
begin
work
again
he
grudged
everything
now
that
kept
him
away
from
his
easel
he
disappeared
from
the
sight
of
his
ordinary
companions
he
did
not
even
seek
the
society
of
geary
or
of
young
haight
all
the
sketches
he
had
made
for
the
last
enemy
together
with
his
easel
and
his
disused
palette
his
tubes
brushes
and
all
the
other
materials
and
tools
for
his
work
he
caused
to
be
transferred
to
the
new
studio
besides
this
he
had
the
stretcher
made
best
twill
canvas
on
a
frame
four
feet
long
two
and
a
half
feet
high
this
was
for
the
large
sketch
of
the
picture
but
the
finished
work
he
calculated
would
demand
an
eight
by
five
stretcher
he
did
not
think
of
decorating
the
room
of
putting
any
ornaments
about
the
wall
he
was
too
serious
too
much
in
earnest
now
to
think
of
that
the
studio
was
not
to
be
his
lounging
place
but
his
workshop
his
art
was
work
with
him
now
hard
serious
work
it
was
above
all
that
he
needed
to
set
him
right
again
regular
work
steady
earnest
work
not
the
dilettante
fancy
of
an
amateur
content
with
making
pretty
things
never
in
his
life
had
vandover
been
so
happy
he
came
and
went
continually
between
his
rooms
his
studio
and
his
art
dealers
tramping
grandly
about
the
city
whistling
to
himself
strong
elated
filled
with
energy
vigour
ambition
at
times
his
mind
was
full
of
thankfulness
at
this
deliverance
at
the
eleventh
hour
at
times
it
was
busy
with
the
details
of
the
picture
its
composition
its
colour
scheme
the
main
effects
he
wanted
to
produce
were
isolation
and
intense
heat
the
shadows
on
the
sand
would
be
blue
the
horizon
line
high
on
the
canvas
the
sky
would
be
light
in
tone
almost
white
near
the
earth
the
morning
when
he
first
began
to
work
was
charming
his
new
studio
was
in
the
top
floor
of
a
building
and
on
arriving
there
breathless
from
his
long
climb
up
the
stairs
vandover
threw
open
the
window
and
gazed
out
and
down
upon
the
city
spread
out
below
him
enjoying
the
view
a
moment
before
settling
to
his
work
a
little
later
the
trades
would
be
blowing
strong
and
brisk
from
the
ocean
driving
steadily
through
the
golden
gate
filling
the
city
with
a
taint
of
salt
but
at
present
the
air
was
calm
touched
with
a
certain
nimbleness
a
sparkling
effervescence
invigourating
exhilarating
it
was
early
in
the
forenoon
not
yet
past
nine
and
the
mist
that
gathers
over
the
city
just
before
dawn
was
steaming
off
under
the
sun
very
thin
and
delicate
turning
all
distant
objects
a
flat
tone
of
pale
blue
over
the
roofs
of
the
houses
he
could
catch
a
glimpse
of
the
distant
mountains
faint
purple
masses
against
the
pale
edge
of
the
sky
rimming
the
horizon
round
with
a
fillet
of
delicate
colour
but
any
larger
view
was
barred
by
a
huge
frame
house
with
a
slated
mansard
roof
directly
opposite
him
across
the
street
a
residence
house
one
of
the
few
in
the
neighbourhood
it
had
been
newly
painted
white
and
showed
brave
and
gay
against
the
dark
blue
of
the
sky
and
the
ruddy
greens
of
the
great
garden
in
which
it
stood
vandover
from
his
window
could
from
time
to
time
catch
the
smell
of
eucalyptus
trees
coming
to
him
in
long
aromatic
breaths
mingled
with
the
odour
of
wet
grass
and
fresh
paint
somewhere
he
heard
a
hummingbird
singing
a
tiny
tweedling
thread
of
song
while
farther
off
two
roosters
were
crowing
back
and
forth
at
each
other
with
strained
and
raucous
trumpet
calls
vandover
turned
back
to
his
work
under
the
huge
north
light
was
the
easel
and
clamped
upon
it
the
stretcher
blank
and
untouched
the
very
sight
of
the
heavy
twill
was
an
inspiration
already
vandover
saw
a
great
picture
upon
it
a
great
wave
of
emotion
suddenly
welled
up
within
him
and
he
cried
with
enthusiasm
by
god
it
is
in
moods
like
this
that
are
made
around
the
baseboard
of
the
room
were
a
row
of
for
the
picture
on
small
mere
blotches
of
colour
laid
on
with
the
palette
knife
and
large
brushes
almost
unintelligible
to
any
one
but
vandover
he
selected
two
or
three
of
these
and
fastened
them
to
the
easel
above
the
big
stretcher
where
he
could
have
them
continually
in
his
eye
he
lit
his
pipe
rolled
up
his
and
standing
before
the
easel
began
to
sharpen
a
stick
of
charcoal
with
an
old
razor
drawing
the
blade
toward
him
so
as
to
keep
the
point
of
the
stick
from
breaking
then
at
last
with
a
deep
breath
of
satisfaction
he
began
blocking
in
the
first
large
construction
lines
of
his
picture
it
was
one
before
he
knew
it
he
went
downtown
and
had
a
hasty
lunch
jealous
of
every
moment
that
was
not
spent
on
his
picture
the
sight
of
it
as
he
the
room
sent
a
thrill
all
over
him
he
was
succeeding
better
than
he
could
have
expected
doing
better
than
he
thought
he
would
he
felt
sure
that
now
he
should
do
good
work
every
stage
of
the
picture
progress
was
an
inspiration
for
the
next
one
at
this
time
the
figures
had
only
been
placed
broadly
sketched
in
large
lines
blocked
in
as
he
called
it
the
next
step
was
the
second
drawing
much
more
finished
he
rapped
the
stretcher
sharply
with
his
knuckles
it
responded
sonorously
like
a
drumhead
the
vibration
shaking
the
charcoal
from
the
tracings
filling
the
air
with
a
fine
dust
the
outlines
grew
faint
just
perceptible
enough
to
guide
him
in
the
second
more
detailed
drawing
he
brought
his
stick
of
charcoal
to
a
very
fine
edge
and
set
to
work
carefully
in
a
moment
he
stopped
and
with
his
chamois
cloth
dusted
out
what
he
had
drawn
he
had
made
a
false
start
he
began
but
could
not
recall
how
the
lines
should
run
his
fingers
were
willing
enough
in
his
imagination
he
saw
just
how
the
outlines
should
be
but
somehow
he
could
not
make
his
hand
interpret
what
was
in
his
head
some
third
medium
through
which
the
one
used
to
act
upon
the
other
was
sluggish
dull
worse
than
that
it
seemed
to
be
absent
well
he
muttered
ca
i
make
this
come
out
right
then
he
tried
more
carefully
his
imagination
saw
the
picture
clearer
his
hand
moved
with
more
assurance
but
the
two
seemed
to
act
independently
of
each
other
the
forms
he
made
on
the
canvas
were
no
adequate
reflection
of
those
in
his
brain
some
third
delicate
and
subtle
faculty
that
coordinated
the
other
two
and
that
called
forth
a
sure
and
instant
response
to
the
dictates
of
his
mind
was
lacking
the
lines
on
his
canvas
were
those
of
a
child
just
learning
to
draw
one
saw
for
what
they
were
intended
but
they
were
crude
they
had
no
life
no
meaning
the
very
thing
that
would
have
made
them
intelligible
interpretive
that
would
have
made
them
art
was
absent
a
third
a
fourth
and
a
fifth
time
vandover
made
the
attempt
it
was
useless
he
knew
that
it
was
not
because
his
hand
lacked
cunning
on
account
of
long
disuse
such
a
thing
in
spite
of
popular
belief
never
happened
to
artists
a
good
artist
might
abandon
his
work
for
five
years
ten
years
and
take
it
up
again
precisely
where
he
had
laid
it
down
with
no
loss
of
technical
skill
no
this
thing
seemed
more
subtle
so
subtle
that
at
first
he
could
hardly
grasp
it
but
suddenly
a
great
fear
came
upon
him
a
momentary
return
of
that
wild
hysterical
terror
from
which
he
believed
he
had
forever
escaped
is
it
gone
he
cried
out
is
it
gone
from
me
my
art
steady
he
went
on
passing
his
hand
over
his
face
with
a
reassuring
smile
steady
old
man
this
wo
do
again
and
so
soon
it
wo
do
for
you
to
get
scared
twice
like
that
this
is
just
nervousness
you
are
overexcited
pshaw
what
the
matter
with
me
let
get
to
work
still
another
time
he
dusted
out
what
he
had
done
and
recommenced
concentrating
all
his
attention
with
a
tremendous
effort
of
the
will
grotesque
and
meaningless
shapes
the
mocking
caricatures
of
those
he
saw
in
his
fancy
grew
under
his
charcoal
while
slowly
slowly
a
queer
numb
feeling
came
in
his
head
like
a
rising
fog
and
the
touch
of
that
unreasoning
terror
returned
this
time
stronger
more
persistent
more
tenacious
than
before
vandover
nerved
himself
against
it
not
daring
to
give
in
fearing
to
allow
himself
to
see
what
this
really
meant
he
passed
one
hand
over
his
cheek
and
along
the
side
of
his
head
the
fingers
dancing
hum
he
muttered
looking
vaguely
about
him
this
is
bad
i
must
let
this
get
the
better
of
me
now
i
knock
off
for
take
a
little
rest
begin
again
in
ten
minutes
he
was
back
at
his
easel
again
his
charcoal
wandered
tracing
empty
lines
on
his
canvas
the
strange
numbness
grew
again
in
his
head
all
the
objects
in
the
range
of
his
eyes
seemed
to
move
back
and
stand
on
the
same
plane
he
became
a
little
dizzy
it
the
he
exclaimed
that
pipe
always
was
too
strong
he
turned
away
to
the
open
window
feeling
an
irresistible
need
of
distraction
of
amusement
and
he
remained
there
resting
on
his
elbows
listening
and
looking
trying
to
be
interested
it
was
toward
the
middle
of
the
afternoon
the
morning
mist
was
long
since
evaporated
and
the
first
faint
puffs
of
the
inevitable
trade
wind
were
just
stirring
the
leaves
of
the
eucalyptus
across
the
street
in
the
of
the
white
house
the
young
lady
of
the
family
had
opened
the
piano
and
was
practising
the
scales
and
arpeggios
following
one
another
without
interruption
came
to
his
ears
in
a
pleasant
monotone
a
chinese
boy
in
a
stiff
blouse
of
white
linen
made
a
great
splashing
as
he
washed
down
the
front
steps
with
a
bucket
of
water
and
the
garden
hose
grocery
and
delivery
wagons
came
and
went
rattling
over
the
cobbles
and
while
occasionally
a
whistle
blew
very
far
off
at
the
corner
of
the
street
by
a
a
little
boy
in
a
leather
cap
was
calling
incessantly
for
some
unseen
dog
whistling
and
slapping
his
knees
an
ex
stopped
a
few
doors
below
the
white
house
and
the
driver
pulled
down
the
with
a
strident
rattle
of
chains
the
cable
in
its
slot
kept
up
an
unceasing
burr
and
clack
while
the
cars
themselves
trundled
up
and
down
the
street
starting
and
stopping
with
a
jangling
of
bells
the
jostled
glass
windows
whirring
in
a
prolonged
vibrant
note
all
these
sounds
played
lightly
over
the
steady
muffled
roar
that
seemed
to
come
from
all
quarters
at
once
it
was
that
deep
murmur
that
great
minor
diapason
that
always
disengages
itself
from
vast
bodies
from
mountains
from
oceans
from
forests
from
sleeping
armies
the
desire
for
movement
for
diversion
for
anything
that
would
keep
him
from
thinking
was
not
to
be
resisted
vandover
caught
up
his
hat
and
fled
from
the
room
not
daring
to
look
again
at
the
easel
once
outside
he
began
to
walk
anywhere
straight
before
him
going
on
with
great
strides
his
head
in
the
air
he
found
charlie
geary
and
took
him
to
supper
vandover
talked
continually
on
all
sorts
of
subjects
speaking
very
rapidly
in
the
evening
he
insisted
on
geary
going
to
the
theatre
with
him
he
paid
the
closest
attention
to
the
play
letting
it
occupy
his
mind
entirely
when
the
play
was
over
and
the
two
were
about
to
say
good
night
vandover
began
to
urge
geary
to
sleep
up
at
his
rooms
that
night
he
overrode
his
objections
interrupting
him
taking
hold
of
his
arm
and
starting
off
but
geary
a
little
surprised
at
his
manner
refused
there
were
certain
law
papers
he
had
taken
home
with
him
from
the
office
that
afternoon
and
that
it
was
necessary
he
should
return
in
the
morning
ah
you
bet
he
would
get
it
right
in
the
neck
if
old
beale
did
have
those
depositions
the
first
thing
when
the
office
was
open
ah
he
was
getting
to
be
indispensable
down
there
he
had
had
fischer
place
now
for
a
year
fischer
had
never
come
back
and
he
had
the
promise
of
being
taken
on
as
head
clerk
as
soon
as
beale
went
into
the
partnership
with
old
beale
i
make
my
way
in
this
town
yet
he
declared
i
be
in
that
partnership
myself
some
day
you
see
yes
sir
ah
you
bet
the
idea
of
passing
the
night
alone
terrified
vandover
he
started
toward
home
walking
up
sutter
street
proceeding
slowly
his
hands
in
his
pockets
all
at
once
he
stopped
without
knowing
why
he
roused
himself
and
looked
about
him
there
was
a
smell
of
eucalyptus
in
the
air
across
the
street
was
the
huge
white
house
and
he
found
that
he
had
stopped
just
before
the
door
of
the
building
on
the
top
floor
of
which
his
studio
was
situated
all
day
vandover
mind
had
been
in
the
greatest
agitation
his
ideas
leaping
and
darting
hither
and
thither
like
terrified
birds
in
a
cage
just
now
he
underwent
a
sudden
reaction
it
had
all
been
a
matter
of
fancy
nothing
but
nervousness
he
had
not
drawn
for
some
time
his
hand
lacked
cunning
from
long
disuse
the
desire
for
work
came
upon
him
again
overpoweringly
he
wanted
to
see
again
if
he
could
not
draw
just
as
truly
and
freely
as
in
the
old
days
no
he
could
not
wait
till
morning
he
must
put
himself
to
the
test
again
at
once
at
the
very
instant
it
was
a
sudden
feminine
caprice
induced
no
doubt
by
the
exalted
strained
and
unnatural
condition
of
his
nerves
a
caprice
that
could
not
be
reasoned
with
that
could
not
be
withstood
he
had
his
keys
with
him
he
opened
the
outside
door
and
groped
his
way
up
the
four
long
flights
of
stairs
to
his
studio
the
studio
was
full
of
a
sombre
like
a
fog
spreading
downward
from
the
great
north
light
in
the
sloping
roof
the
window
was
still
wide
open
the
stretcher
showed
a
pale
gray
blur
vandover
was
about
to
light
the
gas
when
he
checked
himself
his
arm
still
raised
above
his
head
ah
no
he
did
not
dare
to
look
at
the
result
of
his
day
work
it
would
be
better
to
start
in
afresh
from
the
beginning
he
found
the
chamois
skin
on
the
tray
of
the
easel
and
rubbed
out
all
the
drawing
on
the
canvas
then
he
lit
the
gas
as
he
turned
to
his
work
once
more
a
little
thrill
of
joy
and
of
relief
passed
over
him
this
time
his
hand
was
sure
steady
his
head
was
clear
it
had
been
nervousness
after
all
as
he
picked
up
his
charcoal
he
even
exclaimed
to
himself
just
the
same
that
a
curious
experience
this
afternoon
but
the
curious
experience
repeated
itself
again
that
night
as
soon
as
he
tried
to
work
once
more
certain
shapes
and
figures
were
born
upon
his
canvas
but
they
were
no
longer
the
true
children
of
his
imagination
they
were
no
longer
his
own
they
were
changelings
grotesque
abortions
it
was
as
if
the
brute
in
him
like
some
malicious
witch
had
stolen
away
the
true
offspring
of
his
mind
putting
in
their
place
these
deformed
dwarfs
its
own
hideous
spawn
through
the
numbness
and
giddiness
that
gradually
came
into
his
head
like
a
poisonous
murk
he
saw
one
thing
clearly
it
was
gone
his
art
was
gone
the
one
thing
that
could
save
him
that
too
like
all
the
other
good
things
of
his
life
he
had
destroyed
at
some
time
during
those
years
of
debauchery
it
had
died
that
subtle
elusive
something
delicate
as
a
flower
he
had
ruined
it
little
by
little
it
had
exhaled
away
wilting
in
the
air
of
unrestrained
debauches
perishing
in
the
warm
atmosphere
of
disreputable
houses
defiled
by
the
breath
of
abandoned
women
trampled
into
the
spilt
of
the
imperial
dragged
all
fouled
and
polluted
through
the
lowest
mire
of
the
great
city
vice
for
a
moment
vandover
felt
as
though
he
was
losing
his
hold
upon
his
reason
the
return
of
the
hysteria
shook
him
like
a
dry
light
leaf
he
suddenly
had
a
sensation
that
the
room
was
too
small
to
hold
him
he
ran
almost
reeled
to
the
open
window
drawing
his
breath
deep
and
fast
inhaling
the
cool
night
air
rolling
his
eyes
wildly
it
was
night
he
looked
out
into
a
vast
space
sown
with
points
of
light
winking
lamps
and
steady
stars
below
him
was
the
sleeping
city
all
the
lesser
staccato
noises
of
the
day
had
long
since
died
to
silence
there
only
remained
that
prolonged
and
sullen
diapason
coming
from
all
quarters
at
once
it
was
like
the
breathing
of
some
infinitely
great
monster
alive
and
palpitating
the
sistole
and
diastole
of
some
gigantic
heart
the
whole
existence
of
the
great
slumbering
city
passed
upward
there
before
him
through
the
still
night
air
in
one
long
wave
of
sound
it
was
life
the
murmur
of
the
great
mysterious
force
that
spun
the
wheels
of
nature
and
that
sent
it
onward
like
some
enormous
engine
resistless
relentless
an
engine
that
sped
straight
forward
driving
before
it
the
infinite
herd
of
humanity
driving
it
on
at
breathless
speed
through
all
eternity
driving
it
no
one
knew
whither
crushing
out
inexorably
all
those
who
lagged
behind
the
herd
and
who
fell
from
exhaustion
grinding
them
to
dust
beneath
its
myriad
iron
wheels
riding
over
them
still
driving
on
the
herd
that
yet
remained
driving
it
recklessly
blindly
on
and
on
toward
some
goal
some
vague
unknown
end
some
mysterious
fearful
bourne
forever
hidden
in
thick
darkness
chapter
fifteen
about
a
week
later
hiram
wade
ida
father
brought
suit
against
vandover
to
recover
thousand
dollars
claiming
that
his
daughter
had
killed
herself
because
she
had
been
ruined
by
him
and
that
he
alone
was
responsible
for
her
suicide
vandover
had
passed
this
week
in
an
agony
of
grief
over
the
loss
of
his
art
a
grief
that
seemed
even
sharper
than
that
which
he
had
felt
over
the
death
of
his
father
for
this
last
calamity
was
like
the
death
of
a
child
of
his
some
dear
sweet
child
that
might
have
been
his
companion
throughout
all
his
life
at
times
it
seemed
to
him
impossible
that
his
art
should
fail
him
in
this
manner
and
again
and
again
he
would
put
himself
at
his
easel
only
to
experience
afresh
the
return
of
the
numbness
in
his
brain
the
impotency
of
his
fingers
he
had
begun
little
by
little
to
pick
up
the
course
of
his
life
once
more
and
on
a
certain
wednesday
morning
was
looking
listlessly
through
the
morning
paper
as
he
sat
in
his
the
room
was
delightful
flooded
with
the
morning
sun
the
assyrian
just
touched
with
a
ruddy
light
the
renaissance
portraits
looking
down
at
him
through
a
fine
golden
haze
a
little
fire
just
enough
to
blunt
the
keenness
of
the
early
morning
air
snapping
in
the
famous
tiled
and
flamboyant
stove
all
about
the
room
was
a
pleasant
fragrance
of
coffee
and
good
tobacco
vandover
caught
sight
of
the
announcement
of
the
suit
with
a
sudden
sharp
intake
of
breath
that
was
half
gasp
half
cry
starting
up
from
the
reading
it
over
again
and
again
with
staring
eyes
it
was
a
very
short
paragraph
not
more
than
a
dozen
lines
lost
at
the
bottom
of
a
column
among
the
cheap
advertisements
it
made
no
allusion
to
any
former
stage
of
the
affair
from
its
tone
ida
might
have
killed
herself
only
the
day
before
it
seemed
hardly
more
than
a
notice
that
some
enterprising
reporter
burrowing
in
the
records
at
the
city
hall
had
unearthed
and
brought
to
light
with
the
idea
that
it
might
be
of
possible
interest
to
a
few
readers
of
the
paper
but
there
was
his
name
staring
back
at
him
from
out
the
gray
blur
of
the
type
like
some
reflection
of
himself
seen
in
a
mirror
insignificant
as
the
paragraph
was
it
seemed
to
vandover
as
though
it
was
the
only
item
in
the
whole
paper
one
might
as
well
have
trumpeted
his
crime
through
the
streets
but
thousand
dollars
exclaimed
vandover
terrified
where
will
find
thousand
dollars
and
at
once
he
fell
to
wondering
as
to
whether
or
no
in
default
of
payment
he
could
be
sent
to
the
penitentiary
the
idea
of
winning
the
suit
did
not
enter
his
mind
an
instant
he
did
not
even
dream
of
fighting
it
for
the
moment
it
was
like
fire
driving
out
fire
he
forgot
the
loss
of
his
art
his
mind
filled
only
with
the
sense
of
the
last
disaster
what
could
he
do
thousand
dollars
it
would
ruin
him
a
cry
of
exasperation
of
rage
at
his
own
folly
escaped
him
ah
what
a
fool
i
been
for
an
hour
he
raged
to
and
fro
in
the
delightful
sunlit
room
pacing
back
and
forth
in
its
longest
dimension
between
the
bamboo
and
the
low
bookcase
a
thousand
different
plans
and
projects
coming
and
going
in
his
head
as
his
wits
steadied
themselves
he
began
to
see
that
he
must
consult
at
once
with
some
lawyer
field
of
course
perhaps
something
could
be
done
a
clever
lawyer
might
make
out
a
case
for
him
after
all
but
all
at
once
he
became
convinced
that
field
would
not
undertake
his
defence
he
knew
he
had
no
case
so
what
could
field
do
for
him
he
would
have
to
tell
him
the
truth
and
he
saw
with
absolute
clearness
that
the
lawyer
would
refuse
to
try
to
defend
him
the
thing
could
not
honourably
be
done
but
then
what
he
do
he
must
have
legal
advice
from
some
quarter
he
was
still
in
this
state
of
perplexity
when
charlie
geary
arrived
pounding
on
the
door
and
opening
it
immediately
afterward
as
was
his
custom
hello
said
vandover
surprised
hello
charlie
is
that
you
say
exclaimed
geary
without
returning
his
greeting
holding
up
his
hand
as
if
to
interrupt
him
say
have
you
seen
your
lawyer
yet
seen
lawyer
no
answered
vandover
shaking
his
head
gravely
no
i
only
this
minute
read
about
it
in
the
paper
he
was
glad
that
geary
had
come
at
once
he
felt
a
desire
to
throw
this
burden
upon
his
chum
shoulders
to
let
him
assume
the
management
of
the
affair
just
as
in
the
old
college
days
he
had
willingly
weakly
submitted
to
the
dictatorship
of
the
shrewder
stronger
man
who
smoothed
out
his
difficulties
for
him
and
extricated
him
from
all
his
scrapes
he
knew
geary
to
be
full
of
energy
and
resource
and
he
had
confidence
in
his
ability
as
a
lawyer
even
though
he
was
so
young
in
years
and
experience
besides
this
he
was
his
friend
his
college
chum
for
all
geary
disagreeable
qualities
he
knew
he
would
do
the
right
thing
by
him
now
you
the
one
man
of
all
others
i
wanted
to
see
he
exclaimed
as
he
gripped
his
hand
by
george
i
glad
you
have
come
here
sit
down
and
let
talk
this
over
geary
took
the
big
leather
chair
behind
the
desk
and
vandover
flung
himself
again
upon
the
it
was
as
if
the
two
were
back
in
the
room
in
matthew
hundreds
of
times
in
those
days
they
had
occupied
precisely
these
positions
geary
bending
over
at
the
study
table
intent
nervous
very
keen
vandover
lounging
idly
upon
the
resting
easily
on
his
elbow
listening
to
the
other
advice
now
what
must
i
do
charlie
vandover
began
see
my
lawyer
i
suppose
but
do
you
think
a
lawyer
like
field
would
take
my
case
you
know
i
have
a
leg
to
stand
on
but
you
have
seen
him
inquired
geary
sharply
have
seen
anybody
about
it
vandover
shook
his
head
sure
insisted
geary
anxiously
why
i
have
only
just
heard
about
it
twenty
minutes
ago
protested
vandover
why
are
you
so
particular
about
that
he
added
then
geary
exploded
his
mine
because
he
said
with
a
smile
of
triumph
that
he
could
not
restrain
because
we
are
the
counsel
for
the
other
side
i
am
on
the
case
vandover
bounded
from
the
speechless
with
astonishment
bitterly
disappointed
he
shouted
geary
slowly
nodded
his
head
enjoying
vandover
bewilderment
vandover
dropped
back
upon
the
cushions
again
staring
at
him
wildly
with
growing
suspicion
and
anger
he
would
not
have
thought
it
possible
that
geary
could
so
sacrifice
their
old
friendship
to
his
own
personal
interest
the
two
continued
staring
at
each
other
across
the
table
for
a
moment
in
the
silence
they
heard
the
long
rumble
of
a
passing
the
house
and
the
persistent
jangling
of
its
bell
as
it
approached
the
street
crossing
a
grocery
wagon
went
up
the
side
street
the
horses
hoofs
making
a
cadenced
clapping
sound
upon
the
asphalt
well
exclaimed
vandover
scornfully
i
suppose
that
business
but
i
would
call
it
damned
unkind
now
look
here
old
man
returned
geary
consolingly
do
you
take
the
off
the
safety
valve
like
that
what
am
i
here
for
if
it
is
to
help
you
maybe
you
do
know
that
this
is
a
mighty
unprofessional
thing
to
do
ah
you
bet
if
old
beale
knew
this
i
would
get
it
right
in
the
neck
do
you
suppose
i
can
help
you
more
as
wade
lawyer
than
i
could
as
yours
and
now
that
the
very
first
thing
i
got
to
tell
you
to
keep
this
dark
that
i
have
seen
you
i
do
anything
for
you
if
you
do
promise
that
oh
that
all
right
returned
vandover
reassured
that
all
right
you
can
it
not
considered
the
right
thing
to
do
geary
continued
not
heeding
vandover
answer
but
i
just
do
it
because
he
began
to
make
awkward
gestures
with
both
his
hands
because
we
old
friends
like
that
that
was
the
very
first
thing
i
thought
of
when
beale
told
me
that
we
two
had
the
case
that
i
could
get
you
out
of
this
hole
better
as
wade
lawyer
than
as
your
own
ah
you
bet
i
was
clever
enough
to
see
that
the
first
thing
i
sure
it
was
awfully
good
of
you
old
man
said
vandover
sincerely
i
in
a
lot
of
trouble
nowadays
well
now
do
you
bother
van
answered
geary
consolingly
i
guess
we
can
pull
you
out
of
this
all
right
he
drew
up
to
the
table
looking
about
from
side
to
side
got
any
writing
paper
concealed
about
the
premises
he
asked
vandover
pushed
him
over
his
writing
pad
and
geary
taking
the
cap
from
his
fountain
pen
began
asking
a
series
of
questions
taking
down
his
answers
in
shorthand
after
he
had
asked
him
as
to
his
age
length
of
residence
in
the
city
his
property
and
some
few
other
technical
matters
he
leaned
back
in
his
chair
and
said
now
let
hear
your
side
of
the
story
van
i
do
suppose
you
like
to
go
over
the
thing
again
but
you
see
i
ought
to
know
vandover
told
of
the
affair
geary
making
notes
as
he
went
along
it
was
nearly
noon
before
their
interview
was
at
an
end
then
geary
gathered
up
the
papers
and
reached
for
his
hat
and
stick
saying
well
now
that
all
we
can
do
i
think
i
be
up
to
see
you
again
day
after
in
the
afternoon
beale
and
i
have
a
date
with
wade
again
i
think
and
i
can
talk
to
you
more
definitely
after
that
you
know
this
is
the
devil
of
a
thing
to
do
he
suddenly
exclaimed
apprehensively
this
playing
back
and
forth
between
the
two
parties
like
this
regularly
dishonourable
do
you
know
if
you
think
it
dishonourable
said
vandover
as
he
accompanied
geary
to
the
door
if
you
think
it
dishonourable
charlie
why
do
do
it
i
do
want
to
ask
you
to
do
anything
dishonourable
for
me
oh
that
all
right
replied
geary
uneasily
i
had
just
as
soon
do
it
for
you
only
listen
to
this
do
you
say
a
word
about
the
case
to
anybody
not
to
your
lawyer
nor
to
anybody
if
field
should
write
to
you
you
tell
him
you
have
counsel
already
and
look
here
you
may
have
the
reporters
up
here
pretty
soon
and
do
you
open
your
face
to
them
you
mind
that
do
you
let
them
get
a
thing
out
of
you
and
another
thing
you
must
understand
i
not
your
lawyer
of
course
you
see
that
i
could
be
disbarred
if
i
was
lawyer
for
both
sides
it
like
this
you
see
i
wade
lawyer
at
least
the
firm
i
am
with
are
his
lawyers
and
of
course
i
acting
in
wade
interest
but
you
an
old
chum
of
mine
and
if
i
can
i
going
to
try
and
make
it
easier
for
you
you
understand
do
you
yes
i
understand
charlie
answered
vandover
and
you
are
just
a
brick
vandover
passed
the
rest
of
the
day
in
his
the
suspense
of
the
situation
slowly
screwing
his
nerves
tenser
and
tenser
he
walked
for
hours
back
and
forth
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
back
his
head
bent
down
his
forehead
drawn
into
a
frown
of
anxiety
and
exasperation
or
he
stood
for
a
long
time
at
the
window
looking
out
into
the
street
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
at
supper
that
night
he
found
that
his
appetite
had
left
him
the
very
thought
of
food
revolted
him
he
returned
to
his
room
between
seven
and
eight
his
body
and
mind
completely
fagged
feeling
a
crying
need
of
some
diversion
some
escape
from
the
thoughts
that
had
been
hounding
him
all
day
he
made
up
his
mind
to
read
a
little
before
going
to
bed
and
all
at
once
remembered
a
book
that
he
had
once
begun
a
long
time
ago
but
had
never
finished
the
story
of
two
men
who
had
bought
a
wrecked
opium
ship
for
fifty
thousand
dollars
and
had
afterward
discovered
that
she
contained
only
a
few
tins
of
the
drug
he
had
never
read
on
to
find
how
that
story
turned
out
suddenly
he
found
himself
repeating
thousand
dollars
thousand
dollars
where
will
find
thousand
dollars
he
wondered
if
he
would
go
to
jail
if
he
failed
to
pay
his
interest
in
the
book
was
gone
in
a
moment
and
he
took
up
another
of
his
favourite
novels
the
story
of
a
boy
at
the
time
of
christ
a
jewish
boy
unjustly
condemned
to
the
galleys
liberated
afterward
and
devoting
his
life
to
the
overthrow
of
his
enemy
whom
at
last
he
overcame
and
humbled
fouling
him
in
a
chariot
race
all
but
killing
him
he
sat
down
in
the
huge
leather
chair
and
drawing
it
up
to
the
piano
lamp
and
cocking
his
feet
upon
the
table
began
to
read
in
a
few
moments
the
same
numbness
stole
into
his
head
like
a
rising
fog
a
queer
tense
feeling
growing
at
the
back
of
his
forehead
and
at
the
base
of
his
skull
a
dulness
a
strange
stupefying
sensation
as
of
some
torpid
murky
atmosphere
he
looked
about
him
quickly
all
the
objects
in
the
range
of
his
vision
the
corner
of
the
desk
the
corduroy
couch
the
low
bookcase
with
flossie
yellow
slipper
and
barye
lioness
upon
it
seemed
to
move
back
and
stand
upon
the
same
plane
the
objects
themselves
appeared
immovable
enough
but
the
sensation
of
them
in
his
brain
somewhere
behind
his
eyes
began
to
move
about
in
a
slow
dizzy
whirl
the
old
touch
of
unreasoning
terror
came
back
together
with
a
sudden
terror
of
the
spirit
a
sickening
sinking
of
the
heart
a
loathing
of
life
terrible
beyond
words
vandover
started
up
striving
to
keep
himself
in
hand
fighting
against
a
wild
desire
to
rush
about
from
wall
to
wall
shrieking
and
waving
his
arms
over
and
over
again
he
exclaimed
oh
is
the
matter
with
me
the
strangeness
of
the
thing
was
what
unsettled
and
unnerved
him
he
had
all
the
sensations
of
terror
but
without
any
assignable
reason
and
this
groundless
fear
became
in
the
end
the
cause
of
a
new
fear
he
was
afraid
of
this
fear
that
was
afraid
of
nothing
very
gradually
however
the
crisis
passed
away
he
became
a
little
calmer
and
as
he
was
mixing
himself
a
glass
of
whisky
and
water
at
the
sideboard
he
decided
that
he
would
go
to
bed
he
was
sure
that
he
would
be
better
for
a
good
night
rest
evidently
his
nerves
were
out
of
order
it
would
not
do
for
him
to
read
late
at
night
he
realized
all
at
once
that
his
mind
and
body
alike
were
exhausted
he
passed
a
miserable
night
dozing
and
waking
at
alternate
hours
until
three
when
he
found
it
impossible
to
get
to
sleep
hour
after
hour
he
lay
flat
on
his
back
staring
into
the
darkness
listening
to
the
ticking
of
the
clock
the
mysterious
footsteps
that
creaked
the
floors
overhead
and
the
persistent
drip
of
a
water
faucet
outside
in
the
street
he
heard
at
long
intervals
the
rattling
of
wheels
as
the
early
milk
wagons
came
and
went
a
dog
began
to
bark
three
gruff
notes
repeated
monotonously
at
exact
intervals
all
at
once
there
was
a
long
muffled
roll
and
an
abrupt
clacking
noise
it
ceased
then
broke
out
again
sharply
paused
once
more
then
recommenced
settling
to
a
prolonged
minor
hum
the
cable
was
starting
up
it
was
almost
morning
the
window
of
his
room
began
to
show
a
brighter
blur
in
the
darkness
while
very
far
off
he
could
hear
the
steady
puffing
of
a
locomotive
as
the
first
trundled
by
the
house
he
dropped
off
to
sleep
for
the
last
time
being
waked
again
toward
nine
by
the
sound
of
some
one
shovelling
coal
outside
under
his
window
the
shovel
clinking
and
rasping
upon
the
stone
sidewalk
he
felt
a
little
refreshed
but
as
he
entered
the
for
his
late
breakfast
the
smell
of
food
repulsed
him
his
appetite
was
gone
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
eat
toward
eleven
that
same
morning
he
was
pottering
idly
about
his
winding
his
clock
and
shaking
down
the
ashes
in
the
tiled
flamboyant
stove
his
mind
was
still
busy
going
over
for
the
hundredth
time
all
the
possibilities
of
hiram
wade
suit
and
he
was
just
wondering
whether
something
in
the
way
of
a
compromise
might
not
be
arranged
when
with
the
suddenness
of
a
blow
between
the
eyes
the
numbness
in
his
head
returned
together
with
the
same
unreasoning
fear
the
same
depression
of
spirits
the
same
fearful
sinking
of
the
heart
what
it
was
coming
back
again
this
strange
attack
coming
back
even
when
his
attention
was
not
concentrated
even
when
there
was
no
unusual
exertion
of
his
brain
then
the
torment
began
this
time
the
crisis
did
not
pass
off
from
now
on
it
persisted
continually
vandover
began
to
feel
strange
at
first
the
room
looked
unfamiliar
to
him
then
his
own
daily
life
no
longer
seemed
recognizable
and
finally
all
of
a
sudden
it
was
the
whole
world
all
the
existing
order
of
things
that
appeared
to
draw
off
like
a
refluent
tide
leaving
him
alone
abandoned
cast
upon
some
fearful
mysterious
shore
nothing
seemed
worth
while
all
the
thousand
little
trivial
things
that
made
up
the
course
of
his
life
and
in
which
he
found
diversion
and
amusement
palled
upon
him
a
fearful
melancholia
settled
over
him
a
despair
an
abhorrence
of
living
that
could
not
be
uttered
this
only
was
during
the
day
it
was
that
night
that
vandover
went
down
into
the
pit
he
went
to
bed
early
his
brain
in
a
whirl
his
frame
worn
out
as
if
from
long
physical
exertion
he
was
just
dropping
into
a
grateful
sleep
when
his
whole
body
twitched
suddenly
with
a
shock
and
a
recoil
of
all
his
nerves
in
an
instant
he
was
broad
awake
panting
and
exhausted
as
if
from
a
long
run
once
more
he
settled
himself
upon
the
pillow
and
once
more
the
same
leap
the
same
sharp
spasm
of
his
nerves
caught
him
back
to
consciousness
with
the
suddenness
of
a
relaxed
spring
at
last
sleep
was
out
of
the
question
his
drowsiness
of
the
early
part
of
the
evening
passed
away
and
he
lay
back
his
hands
clasped
behind
his
head
staring
up
into
the
darkness
his
thoughts
galloping
incessantly
through
his
brain
suffering
without
pain
as
he
had
never
imagined
a
human
being
could
suffer
though
racked
with
torture
from
head
to
heel
from
time
to
time
a
slow
torsion
and
crisping
of
all
his
nerves
beginning
at
his
ankles
spread
to
every
corner
of
his
body
till
he
had
to
shut
his
fists
and
teeth
against
the
blind
impulse
to
leap
from
his
bed
screaming
his
hands
felt
light
and
as
he
told
himself
jumpy
all
at
once
he
felt
a
peculiar
sensation
in
them
they
seemed
to
swell
the
fingers
puffing
to
an
enormous
size
the
palms
bulging
the
whole
member
from
the
wrist
to
the
nails
distended
like
a
glove
when
one
has
blown
into
it
to
straighten
it
out
then
he
had
a
feeling
that
his
head
was
swelling
in
the
same
way
he
had
to
rub
his
hands
together
to
pass
them
again
and
again
over
his
face
to
rid
himself
of
the
fancy
but
the
strange
numb
feeling
at
the
base
of
the
skull
did
not
keep
him
from
thinking
he
would
have
been
glad
if
it
had
and
now
at
last
when
the
terror
overcame
him
it
was
no
longer
causeless
he
knew
now
what
he
feared
he
feared
that
he
was
going
mad
it
was
the
punishment
that
he
had
brought
upon
himself
some
fearful
nervous
disease
the
result
of
his
long
indulgence
of
vice
his
vile
submission
to
the
brute
that
was
to
destroy
his
reason
some
collapse
of
all
his
faculties
beginning
first
with
that
which
was
highest
most
sensitive
his
art
spreading
onward
and
downward
till
he
should
have
reached
the
last
stages
of
idiocy
it
was
nature
inexorably
exacting
it
was
the
vast
fearful
engine
riding
him
down
beneath
its
myriad
spinning
wheels
remorselessly
irresistibly
the
dreadful
calamities
that
he
had
brought
upon
himself
recoiled
upon
his
head
crushing
him
to
the
dust
with
their
weight
of
anguish
and
remorse
ida
wade
suicide
his
father
death
his
social
banishment
the
loss
of
his
art
hiram
wade
lawsuit
menacing
him
with
beggary
and
now
this
last
this
approaching
insanity
it
was
no
longer
fire
driving
out
fire
the
sense
of
all
these
disasters
seemed
to
come
back
upon
him
at
once
as
keen
as
bitter
as
when
they
had
first
befallen
he
had
told
himself
that
he
did
not
believe
in
a
hell
could
there
be
a
worse
hell
than
this
but
all
at
once
without
knowing
why
moved
by
an
impulse
a
blind
resistless
instinct
vandover
started
up
in
bed
raising
his
clasped
hands
above
him
crying
out
oh
help
me
why
do
you
me
you
can
if
you
only
will
who
was
it
to
whom
he
had
cried
with
such
unerring
intuition
he
gave
no
name
to
this
mysterious
you
this
strange
supernatural
being
this
mighty
superhuman
power
it
was
the
cry
of
a
soul
in
torment
that
does
not
stop
to
reason
the
wild
last
hope
that
feels
its
own
helplessness
that
responds
to
an
intuition
of
a
force
outside
of
itself
the
force
that
can
save
it
in
its
time
of
peril
trembling
his
hands
still
clasped
above
him
vandover
waited
for
an
answer
waited
for
the
miracle
in
the
tortured
exalted
state
of
his
nerves
he
seemed
suddenly
possessed
of
a
sixth
sense
he
fancied
that
he
would
know
there
in
that
room
in
a
few
seconds
while
yet
his
hands
remained
clasped
above
his
head
it
was
his
last
hope
if
this
failed
him
there
was
nothing
left
still
he
waited
he
felt
that
he
should
know
when
the
miracle
came
that
he
would
suddenly
be
filled
with
a
sense
of
peace
of
quiet
joy
still
he
waited
there
was
nothing
nothing
but
the
vast
silence
the
unbroken
blackness
of
the
night
a
night
that
was
to
last
forever
there
was
no
answer
nothing
but
the
deaf
silence
the
blind
darkness
but
in
a
moment
he
felt
that
the
very
silence
the
very
lack
of
answer
was
answer
in
itself
there
was
nothing
for
him
even
that
vast
mysterious
power
to
which
he
had
cried
could
not
help
him
now
not
help
him
could
not
stay
the
inexorable
law
of
nature
could
not
reverse
that
vast
terrible
engine
with
its
myriad
spinning
wheels
that
was
riding
him
down
relentlessly
grinding
him
into
the
dust
and
afterward
after
the
engine
had
done
its
work
when
that
strange
other
time
should
come
that
other
life
what
then
no
not
even
then
nothing
but
outer
darkness
then
and
the
gnashing
of
teeth
nothing
but
the
deaf
silence
nothing
but
the
blind
darkness
nothing
but
the
unbroken
blackness
of
an
eternal
night
it
was
the
end
of
everything
with
a
muffled
cry
oh
i
ca
stand
this
vandover
threw
himself
from
his
bed
groping
his
way
out
into
the
by
this
time
he
was
only
conscious
of
a
suffering
too
great
to
be
borne
everything
else
was
blurred
as
in
a
thick
mist
for
nearly
an
hour
he
stumbled
about
in
the
darkened
room
bruising
himself
against
the
furniture
dazed
numb
trying
in
vain
to
find
the
drawer
of
the
desk
where
he
kept
his
father
revolver
at
last
his
hand
closed
upon
it
gripping
it
so
tightly
that
the
hundreds
of
little
nicks
and
scratches
made
by
the
contact
of
the
tacks
and
nails
which
he
had
hammered
with
it
nipped
and
bit
into
his
palm
like
the
teeth
of
tiny
mice
a
vague
feeling
of
shame
overcame
him
at
the
last
moment
he
had
no
wish
to
be
found
sprawling
upon
the
floor
dressed
only
in
his
he
lit
the
gas
and
put
on
his
bathrobe
drawing
the
cords
securely
about
his
waist
and
neck
when
he
turned
about
to
pick
up
the
revolver
again
he
found
that
his
determination
had
weakened
considerably
and
he
was
obliged
to
reflect
again
upon
the
wreck
of
his
life
and
soul
before
he
was
back
once
more
to
the
proper
pitch
of
resolution
it
was
five
minutes
to
two
and
he
made
up
his
mind
to
kill
himself
when
the
clock
struck
the
hour
he
spent
the
intervening
moments
in
arranging
the
details
of
the
matter
at
first
he
thought
he
would
do
it
standing
but
he
abandoned
that
idea
fearing
to
strike
his
head
against
the
furniture
as
he
fell
he
was
about
to
decide
upon
the
huge
leather
chair
when
the
remembrance
of
his
father
death
made
that
impossible
he
finally
concluded
to
sit
upon
the
edge
of
his
bed
leaning
a
little
backward
so
as
not
to
fall
upon
the
floor
and
he
dragged
the
bed
out
into
the
preferring
somehow
to
die
there
for
a
moment
the
idea
of
lying
at
length
upon
the
bed
occurred
to
him
but
in
an
instant
he
recoiled
from
it
horrified
at
the
thought
of
the
death
that
struck
from
above
no
it
would
be
best
to
sit
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
falling
backward
with
the
shot
then
he
wondered
as
to
which
it
should
be
his
heart
or
his
head
evidently
the
head
was
the
better
there
upon
the
right
side
in
the
little
hollow
of
the
temple
and
the
next
moment
he
found
himself
curiously
touching
and
pressing
the
spot
with
his
fingers
all
at
once
he
heard
the
little
clicking
noise
that
the
clock
makes
a
minute
or
so
before
the
hour
it
was
almost
two
he
sat
down
upon
the
edge
of
the
bed
cocking
the
revolver
waiting
for
the
clock
to
strike
an
idea
came
to
him
and
he
looked
at
the
calendar
that
stood
at
the
right
of
the
clock
upon
the
top
of
the
low
bookcase
it
was
the
twelfth
of
april
thursday
that
then
was
to
be
the
date
of
his
death
thursday
april
twelfth
at
two
in
the
morning
so
it
would
read
upon
his
gravestone
for
an
instant
the
awfulness
of
the
thing
he
was
to
do
came
upon
him
and
the
next
instant
he
found
himself
wondering
if
they
still
coursed
with
greyhounds
down
at
coronado
the
way
they
used
to
do
when
he
was
there
all
at
once
the
clock
struck
two
and
at
the
very
last
instant
a
strange
impulse
to
seat
himself
before
the
mirror
came
upon
him
he
drew
up
a
chair
before
it
watching
his
reflection
intently
but
even
as
he
raised
the
revolver
he
suddenly
changed
his
purpose
without
knowing
why
and
all
at
once
crammed
the
muzzle
into
his
mouth
he
drew
the
trigger
he
heard
no
sound
of
a
report
he
felt
no
shock
but
a
great
feebleness
ran
throughout
his
limbs
a
relaxing
and
weakening
of
all
his
muscles
his
eyes
were
open
and
he
saw
everything
small
and
seemingly
very
far
off
as
through
the
reversed
end
of
an
suddenly
he
fainted
when
vandover
came
to
himself
again
it
was
early
morning
the
room
was
full
of
daylight
but
the
gas
was
still
burning
little
by
little
the
fearful
things
of
the
night
came
back
to
him
he
realized
that
he
had
shot
himself
and
he
waited
for
the
end
not
daring
to
move
his
eyes
closed
his
hand
still
gripping
the
scratched
butt
of
the
revolver
in
his
lap
for
a
long
time
he
lay
back
in
the
chair
motionless
his
consciousness
slowly
returning
like
an
incoming
tide
at
length
he
started
to
his
feet
with
an
expression
of
scorn
and
incredulity
he
was
as
sound
as
ever
there
was
neither
scratch
nor
scar
upon
him
he
had
not
shot
himself
after
all
curiously
he
looked
at
the
revolver
throwing
open
the
breech
the
cylinder
was
empty
he
had
forgotten
to
load
it
what
a
fool
he
exclaimed
laughing
scornfully
and
still
laughing
he
walked
to
the
centre
of
the
room
under
the
chandelier
and
turned
out
the
gas
but
when
he
turned
about
facing
the
day
once
more
facing
that
day
and
the
next
and
the
next
throughout
all
the
course
of
his
life
the
sense
of
his
misery
returned
upon
him
in
its
full
strength
and
he
raised
his
clenched
fist
to
his
eyes
shutting
out
the
light
ah
no
he
could
not
endure
it
the
horror
of
life
overpassed
the
horror
of
death
he
could
not
go
on
living
a
new
thought
had
come
to
him
wretched
as
he
was
he
saw
that
in
time
his
anguish
of
conscience
even
his
dread
of
losing
his
reason
would
pass
from
him
he
would
become
used
to
them
yes
even
become
used
to
the
dread
of
insanity
and
then
he
would
return
once
more
to
vice
return
once
more
into
the
power
of
the
brute
the
perverse
and
evil
monster
that
was
knitted
to
him
now
irrevocably
part
for
part
fibre
for
fibre
he
saw
clearly
that
nothing
could
save
him
he
had
had
his
answer
that
night
there
was
to
be
no
miracle
was
it
not
right
then
that
he
should
destroy
himself
was
it
not
even
his
duty
the
better
part
of
him
seemed
to
demand
the
act
should
he
not
comply
while
there
yet
was
any
better
part
left
in
a
little
while
the
brute
was
to
take
all
on
the
shelves
above
his
washstand
vandover
found
the
cartridges
in
a
green
pasteboard
box
and
loaded
all
the
chambers
of
the
revolver
carefully
he
closed
the
breech
but
as
he
was
about
to
draw
back
the
hammer
all
his
courage
all
his
resolution
crumbled
in
an
instant
like
a
tower
of
sand
he
did
not
dare
to
shoot
himself
he
was
afraid
the
night
before
he
had
been
brave
enough
how
was
it
now
that
he
could
not
call
up
the
same
courage
the
same
determination
when
he
thought
over
the
wreck
the
wretched
failure
of
his
life
the
dreadful
prospect
of
the
future
years
his
anguish
and
his
terror
were
as
keen
as
ever
but
now
there
was
a
shrinking
of
his
every
nerve
from
the
thought
of
suicide
the
instinctive
animal
fear
of
death
stronger
than
himself
his
suffering
had
to
go
on
had
to
run
its
course
even
death
would
not
help
him
let
it
go
on
it
was
only
the
better
part
of
him
that
was
suffering
in
a
little
while
this
better
part
would
be
dead
leaving
only
the
brute
it
would
die
a
natural
death
without
any
intervention
from
him
was
there
any
need
of
suicide
suicide
great
god
his
whole
life
had
been
one
long
suicide
that
same
morning
charlie
geary
had
eaten
a
very
thick
underdone
steak
for
breakfast
after
enjoying
a
fine
long
sleep
of
eight
hours
toward
eight
he
went
downtown
he
did
not
take
a
car
he
preferred
to
walk
it
helped
his
digestion
and
it
gave
him
exercise
at
night
he
walked
home
as
well
that
gave
him
an
appetite
besides
with
the
ten
cents
that
he
saved
in
this
way
he
bought
himself
a
nice
cigar
that
he
smoked
in
the
evening
to
help
digest
his
supper
he
was
very
careful
of
his
health
ah
you
bet
one
had
to
look
out
for
one
health
at
the
office
that
morning
he
had
a
long
talk
with
beale
as
to
hiram
wade
suit
the
great
firm
of
beale
storey
into
whose
office
geary
had
been
received
made
a
specialty
of
damage
suits
and
especially
those
suits
that
were
brought
against
a
certain
great
monopoly
which
it
was
claimed
was
ruining
the
city
and
the
state
such
a
case
involving
nearly
a
quarter
of
a
million
of
dollars
was
now
occupying
the
attention
of
the
heads
of
the
firm
and
indeed
of
the
whole
office
hiram
wade
suit
was
assigned
to
the
assistants
beale
was
one
of
these
and
charlie
geary
had
managed
to
push
himself
into
the
position
of
his
confidential
clerk
but
beale
himself
took
little
interest
in
the
wade
suit
the
suit
against
the
great
monopoly
was
coming
to
a
head
it
was
a
battle
of
giants
the
whole
office
found
itself
embroiled
and
little
by
little
beale
allowed
himself
to
be
drawn
into
the
struggle
the
management
of
the
wade
case
was
given
over
to
geary
hands
when
he
had
first
heard
of
his
assignment
to
the
case
geary
had
been
unwilling
to
act
against
his
old
chum
but
it
was
the
first
legal
affair
of
any
great
importance
with
which
he
had
been
connected
and
he
was
soon
devoured
with
an
inordinate
ambition
to
distinguish
himself
in
the
eyes
of
the
firm
to
get
a
lift
to
take
a
long
step
forward
toward
the
end
of
his
desires
which
was
to
become
one
of
the
firm
itself
he
knew
he
could
make
a
brilliant
success
of
the
case
geary
was
at
this
time
nearly
keen
energetic
immensely
clever
and
the
case
against
vandover
was
strong
no
one
knew
better
than
he
himself
how
intimate
vandover
had
been
with
ida
wade
vandover
had
told
him
much
of
the
details
of
their
acquaintance
besides
this
a
letter
which
ida
had
written
to
vandover
the
day
before
her
suicide
had
been
found
torn
in
three
pieces
thrust
between
the
leaves
of
one
of
the
books
that
she
used
to
study
at
the
normal
school
it
directly
implicated
vandover
it
was
evidence
that
could
not
be
gainsaid
geary
had
resolved
to
push
the
case
against
his
old
chum
vandover
ought
to
see
that
with
geary
it
was
a
matter
of
business
he
geary
was
only
an
instrument
of
the
law
if
geary
did
not
take
the
case
some
other
lawyer
would
at
any
rate
whether
van
would
see
it
in
this
light
or
not
geary
was
determined
to
take
the
case
it
was
too
good
an
opportunity
to
let
slip
he
was
going
to
make
his
way
in
the
law
or
he
would
know
the
reason
why
every
man
for
himself
that
was
what
he
said
it
might
be
damned
selfish
but
it
was
human
nature
if
he
had
to
sacrifice
van
so
much
the
worse
it
was
evident
that
his
old
college
chum
was
going
to
the
dogs
anyway
but
come
whatever
would
geary
was
going
to
be
a
ah
you
bet
he
would
make
his
way
and
he
would
make
his
money
ever
since
he
had
come
into
his
little
patrimony
geary
had
been
making
offers
to
vandover
for
his
block
in
the
mission
geary
would
offer
only
eight
thousand
dollars
but
brunt
steadily
advised
vandover
against
listening
to
such
a
figure
assuring
him
that
the
property
was
valued
at
twelve
thousand
six
hundred
vandover
had
often
wondered
at
persistence
in
the
matter
and
had
often
asked
him
what
he
could
possibly
want
of
the
block
but
geary
was
very
vague
in
his
replies
generally
telling
vandover
that
there
was
money
in
the
investment
if
one
could
and
would
give
the
proper
attention
to
pushing
it
he
told
vandover
that
he
vandover
was
no
business
man
which
was
the
lamentable
truth
and
would
much
prefer
to
live
upon
the
interest
of
his
bonds
rather
than
to
be
continually
annoyed
by
defective
plumbing
complaints
and
repairs
the
truth
of
the
matter
was
that
geary
knew
that
a
certain
immense
boot
and
shoe
concern
was
after
the
same
piece
of
property
the
houses
themselves
were
nothing
to
the
boot
and
shoe
people
they
wanted
the
land
in
order
to
build
their
manufactory
upon
it
a
siding
of
the
railroad
ran
down
the
alley
just
back
of
the
property
a
fact
that
hurt
the
lot
for
residence
purposes
but
that
was
indispensable
for
the
boot
and
shoe
people
geary
knew
that
the
heads
of
the
manufactory
were
determined
to
buy
the
lot
and
he
was
sure
that
if
properly
handled
by
clever
brokers
they
could
be
induced
to
offer
at
least
one
third
more
than
its
appraised
valuation
it
was
a
chance
for
a
fine
speculation
and
it
was
torture
to
geary
to
think
that
vandover
or
in
fact
any
one
besides
himself
was
going
to
profit
by
it
the
afternoon
of
the
day
upon
which
hiram
wade
had
brought
suit
for
thousand
dollars
while
geary
was
pottering
about
his
swivel
office
chair
with
an
oil
can
trying
to
find
out
where
it
creaked
a
brilliant
idea
had
suddenly
occurred
to
him
a
stroke
of
genius
a
veritable
inspiration
why
could
he
not
make
the
wade
suit
a
machine
with
which
to
force
vandover
into
the
sale
of
the
property
his
first
idea
had
been
to
push
the
case
so
vigorously
that
vandover
would
surely
lose
it
but
on
second
thought
this
course
did
not
seem
to
promise
any
satisfactory
results
geary
knew
very
well
that
though
hiram
wade
had
sued
for
thousand
dollars
he
could
not
recover
more
than
five
thousand
if
as
much
as
that
geary
did
not
know
the
exact
state
of
vandover
affairs
but
he
did
not
think
that
his
chum
would
sell
any
property
in
order
to
make
the
payment
of
damages
it
was
much
more
likely
that
he
would
raise
the
five
thousand
or
whatever
it
might
be
by
placing
a
second
mortgage
on
some
of
his
property
this
however
was
presuming
that
wade
would
get
judgment
for
about
five
thousand
dollars
but
suppose
that
vandover
thought
that
wade
could
actually
recover
thousand
suppose
that
geary
himself
should
see
vandover
and
induce
him
to
believe
such
a
story
and
to
settle
the
affair
out
of
court
vandover
was
as
ignorant
of
law
as
he
was
of
business
geary
might
frighten
him
into
a
sale
yet
this
plan
seemed
very
impracticable
in
the
first
place
it
would
be
unprofessional
for
geary
to
have
an
interview
with
vandover
under
such
circumstances
the
story
was
almost
too
monstrous
even
for
vandover
credibility
and
besides
geary
would
not
pay
could
not
pay
thousand
for
the
property
this
last
was
a
serious
tangle
in
order
to
get
vandover
to
sell
geary
would
have
to
represent
the
damage
suit
as
involving
a
larger
sum
of
money
than
geary
was
willing
to
give
for
the
block
even
a
far
larger
sum
than
that
which
the
boot
and
shoe
manufacturers
could
be
induced
to
pay
for
it
it
seemed
to
be
a
deadlock
geary
began
to
see
that
the
whole
idea
was
out
of
the
question
yet
the
desire
of
it
came
back
upon
him
again
and
again
he
dwelt
upon
it
constantly
smelling
out
the
chance
for
a
deal
somewhere
in
the
tangle
with
the
instinct
of
the
keen
man
of
business
at
last
he
seemed
to
have
straightened
it
out
the
idea
of
a
compromise
came
into
his
mind
what
if
vandover
and
hiram
wade
could
be
made
to
compromise
upon
eight
thousand
dollars
geary
would
be
willing
to
pay
vandover
eight
thousand
for
the
block
that
was
his
original
offer
wade
though
he
had
sued
for
thousand
could
easily
be
made
to
see
that
eight
thousand
was
as
much
as
he
could
reasonably
expect
and
geary
knew
the
boot
and
shoe
manufacturers
would
pay
fifteen
thousand
for
the
lot
perhaps
more
but
in
order
to
carry
out
the
delicate
and
complicated
affair
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
keep
vandover
from
seeing
a
lawyer
geary
knew
that
any
lawyer
would
fight
the
proposition
of
a
compromise
at
eight
thousand
dollars
five
thousand
was
as
much
as
wade
could
possibly
get
in
court
and
if
judgment
for
such
amount
was
rendered
counsel
would
advise
him
to
raise
the
sum
by
mortgaging
some
property
instead
of
selling
the
block
yet
as
soon
as
geary
arrived
at
a
solution
of
the
problem
as
soon
as
the
deal
began
to
seem
feasible
he
commenced
to
hesitate
it
was
not
so
much
that
the
affair
was
crooked
that
his
rôle
in
it
was
to
say
the
least
unprofessional
as
it
was
the
fact
that
vandover
was
his
old
college
chum
and
that
to
put
the
matter
into
plain
words
geary
was
swindling
his
best
friend
out
of
a
piece
of
property
valued
at
twelve
thousand
six
hundred
dollars
and
preventing
him
from
reselling
the
same
piece
at
a
very
advanced
figure
again
and
again
he
wished
that
it
was
some
other
than
vandover
he
told
himself
that
in
such
case
he
would
put
the
screw
on
without
the
least
compunction
all
through
one
night
geary
was
on
the
rack
torn
between
his
friendship
for
his
chum
and
his
devouring
inordinate
ambition
to
make
his
way
and
to
make
his
pile
in
the
end
vandover
was
sacrificed
the
opportunity
was
too
good
geary
could
not
resist
the
chance
for
a
deal
ah
you
bet
just
think
of
it
after
all
not
only
would
vandover
believe
that
geary
was
doing
him
a
great
service
but
the
office
would
be
delighted
with
him
for
winning
his
first
case
they
would
get
a
heavy
fee
from
wade
and
he
would
nearly
double
his
money
invested
in
the
block
in
the
mission
as
soon
as
he
had
made
up
his
mind
to
put
the
deal
through
he
had
seen
vandover
at
his
rooms
early
in
the
morning
and
had
induced
him
to
promise
not
to
engage
any
other
counsel
and
in
general
keep
very
quiet
about
the
whole
business
the
day
after
he
and
beale
had
an
appointment
with
hiram
wade
but
toward
noon
beale
disappeared
leaving
word
for
geary
that
he
had
gone
to
court
with
his
father
to
hear
the
closing
arguments
in
the
great
suit
against
the
monopoly
the
last
struggle
in
the
tremendous
legal
battle
that
had
embroiled
the
whole
office
geary
was
to
use
his
own
judgment
in
the
wade
case
geary
laboured
with
hiram
wade
all
that
afternoon
the
old
fellow
mistrusted
him
on
account
of
his
youth
and
his
inexperience
was
unwilling
to
arrive
at
any
definite
conclusion
without
the
sanction
of
geary
older
associate
and
for
a
long
time
would
listen
to
nothing
less
than
ten
thousand
dollars
crying
out
that
his
gray
hairs
had
been
dishonoured
and
striking
his
palm
upon
his
forehead
nothing
could
move
him
he
also
had
his
ambitions
it
was
his
dream
to
own
the
establishment
in
which
he
now
had
but
a
interest
summer
was
coming
the
time
of
year
when
people
were
going
into
the
country
leaving
their
carpets
to
be
cleaned
in
their
absence
if
he
could
obtain
complete
ownership
of
his
business
within
the
month
he
fancied
that
he
saw
an
opportunity
to
make
more
money
than
he
had
done
before
at
any
previous
season
why
i
tell
you
mister
geary
he
exclaimed
indignantly
wagging
his
head
it
would
seem
like
selling
my
daughter
honour
if
we
should
compromise
at
any
less
figure
i
am
a
father
i
i
have
my
feelings
have
i
well
now
it
is
like
that
at
all
wade
answered
geary
making
awkward
gestures
with
both
his
hands
it
is
what
we
to
get
out
of
him
could
any
sum
of
money
could
millions
compensate
you
for
miss
ida
death
i
guess
not
it
what
we
get
if
this
thing
comes
into
court
we
wo
get
but
five
thousand
out
of
him
i
tell
you
that
right
now
he
could
raise
that
by
a
mortgage
easy
but
if
we
compromise
we
can
squeeze
him
for
eight
thousand
you
see
the
fact
that
we
can
act
directly
with
him
instead
of
through
counsel
makes
it
easier
for
us
of
course
as
i
tell
you
it
is
just
the
legal
thing
to
do
but
i
willing
to
do
it
for
you
because
i
think
you
been
wronged
and
outraged
wade
struck
his
hand
to
his
head
i
tell
you
he
brought
dishonour
upon
my
gray
hairs
he
exclaimed
exactly
of
course
i
understand
how
you
feel
replied
geary
but
now
about
this
eight
thousand
i
tell
you
what
i
do
he
had
resolved
to
stake
everything
upon
one
last
hazard
see
here
wade
there
a
difference
of
course
between
eight
thousand
dollars
and
ten
thousand
but
the
use
of
money
is
worth
something
is
it
and
money
down
cold
hard
cash
is
worth
something
is
it
well
now
suppose
you
got
that
eight
thousand
dollars
money
down
within
three
days
hiram
wade
still
demurred
a
little
longer
for
the
sake
of
his
own
and
his
dishonoured
hairs
but
in
the
end
it
was
agreed
that
if
the
money
was
paid
over
to
him
in
full
before
the
end
of
the
following
week
he
would
be
content
and
would
agree
to
the
compromise
eight
thousand
dollars
would
still
be
enough
to
buy
out
his
interest
and
even
then
he
would
have
a
little
left
over
with
which
to
improve
a
certain
steaming
apparatus
if
the
amount
was
paid
in
full
within
a
week
he
could
get
control
of
the
in
time
to
catch
all
of
the
summer
trade
geary
had
calculated
that
this
last
argument
would
have
its
weight
the
great
difficulty
now
was
to
get
vandover
to
sell
at
such
a
low
figure
and
upon
such
short
notice
he
almost
despaired
of
his
success
in
this
quarter
however
it
all
depended
upon
vandover
now
early
in
the
forenoon
of
the
next
day
geary
pounded
on
the
door
of
vandover
pushing
it
open
without
waiting
for
an
answer
vandover
was
lying
in
his
on
the
corduroy
divan
under
the
huge
rug
of
sombre
colours
that
hung
against
the
wall
and
he
did
not
get
up
as
geary
came
in
in
fact
he
hardly
stirred
hello
cried
geary
closing
the
door
with
his
heel
did
expect
to
find
up
so
early
been
up
since
six
had
breakfast
at
seven
fine
cutlet
and
then
got
down
to
the
office
at
twenty
minutes
of
eight
how
that
for
rustling
hey
yes
said
vandover
dully
but
say
exclaimed
geary
what
all
the
matter
with
you
look
all
frazzled
out
all
pale
around
the
wattles
ah
you
been
hitting
up
a
pace
again
you
a
bird
van
there
no
use
talking
all
night
racket
this
trip
i
suppose
so
answered
vandover
never
moving
but
you
look
this
morning
sure
continued
geary
seating
himself
on
the
edge
of
the
table
and
pushing
back
his
hat
never
saw
you
looking
so
bad
you
ought
to
be
more
careful
van
there
be
a
smash
some
time
ah
you
bet
a
man
ought
to
look
out
for
his
health
i
walk
downtown
every
morning
and
three
times
a
week
i
take
a
cold
shower
as
soon
as
i
get
up
ah
i
tell
you
that
braces
a
fellow
up
you
ought
to
try
it
it
better
than
a
dozen
cocktails
you
keep
on
getting
thin
like
you
have
for
the
past
few
days
and
i
have
to
be
calling
you
skinny
again
like
we
used
to
now
tell
the
truth
what
time
did
you
get
to
bed
last
night
did
you
go
to
bed
at
all
no
replied
vandover
with
a
long
breath
looking
vaguely
at
the
on
the
opposite
wall
i
thought
as
much
answered
geary
well
that
like
you
he
paused
a
moment
and
then
went
on
nervously
gesturing
with
both
his
hands
simultaneously
well
i
had
a
long
talk
with
wade
i
tell
you
van
that
old
boy
is
as
stubborn
as
a
mule
you
see
he
knows
he
got
a
case
i
could
talk
him
out
of
that
i
tell
you
how
it
is
continued
geary
preparing
to
spring
another
mine
he
found
a
letter
ida
wrote
you
the
day
before
she
killed
herself
he
paused
to
watch
the
effect
upon
vandover
vandover
waited
for
him
to
go
on
but
seeing
that
he
did
not
and
that
he
expected
him
to
say
something
nodded
his
head
once
and
answered
i
see
do
you
know
that
letter
that
she
wrote
to
you
telling
you
how
it
was
how
she
was
fixed
repeated
geary
puzzled
and
irritated
at
vandover
indifference
i
know
well
he
got
it
anyhow
pursued
geary
and
of
course
that
tells
against
you
well
i
had
a
long
talk
with
him
yesterday
afternoon
and
i
got
him
to
compromise
of
course
you
know
in
suits
like
this
one
a
party
sues
for
a
great
deal
more
than
he
expects
to
get
at
first
you
know
he
said
thousand
that
figure
was
decided
upon
at
the
first
interview
he
had
with
us
of
course
he
could
never
get
judgment
for
that
much
but
he
hung
out
at
ten
thousand
said
it
would
be
selling
his
daughter
if
he
took
any
less
now
i
knew
you
could
raise
that
much
on
any
property
you
have
especially
in
these
hard
times
geary
paused
for
the
fraction
of
an
instant
he
had
thrown
out
the
last
remark
as
a
feeler
to
see
what
vandover
would
say
but
his
chum
said
nothing
staring
vaguely
at
the
opposite
wall
merely
making
a
faint
sign
to
show
that
he
understood
closing
his
eyes
and
bending
his
head
and
so
continued
the
other
i
jewed
him
down
and
what
do
you
suppose
well
sir
from
thousand
i
brought
him
right
down
to
say
eight
thousand
i
could
see
that
he
had
some
scheme
that
he
wants
to
go
into
right
away
and
that
he
wants
ready
money
right
on
the
nail
you
know
to
carry
it
through
ah
you
bet
i
was
clever
enough
to
see
that
i
waltzed
him
right
over
when
i
began
to
speak
of
ready
money
cash
down
as
soon
as
he
squeal
i
spring
cold
cash
on
him
money
down
and
hit
gravel
like
an
ostrich
well
he
went
on
deliberately
after
a
pause
getting
up
from
the
table
and
standing
before
vandover
his
hands
in
his
pockets
well
i
think
that
the
best
i
can
do
for
you
van
it
a
good
deal
better
than
i
expected
but
i
done
the
best
i
could
for
you
and
i
would
advise
you
to
see
him
on
the
proposition
all
right
said
vandover
go
ahead
geary
was
perplexed
well
you
think
that
a
good
thing
do
you
you
think
i
done
my
best
for
you
you
see
it
as
i
do
do
you
vandover
withdrew
his
eyes
from
the
other
wall
glancing
under
heavy
eyelids
at
geary
and
with
a
slight
movement
of
his
head
and
shoulders
replied
of
course
have
you
got
the
money
asked
geary
eagerly
then
irritated
at
his
indiscretion
hastened
to
interrupt
himself
you
see
he
has
put
his
proposition
into
writing
yet
but
it
like
this
if
you
can
pay
him
eight
thousand
dollars
in
cash
before
the
end
of
next
week
he
sign
a
document
to
the
effect
that
he
is
satisfied
i
got
no
money
said
vandover
quietly
i
was
afraid
you
would
have
said
geary
but
you
can
raise
it
somewhere
you
had
better
close
with
the
old
man
as
soon
as
you
can
van
while
he
in
the
mood
for
it
you
make
a
clear
two
thousand
by
it
you
can
see
that
as
well
as
i
can
now
where
can
you
how
is
your
property
fixed
let
see
here
the
statement
you
made
to
me
the
other
day
continued
geary
drawing
his
shorthand
notes
from
his
portfolio
how
about
this
piece
on
california
street
the
one
that
you
have
rented
the
homestead
you
know
yes
there
that
answered
vandover
changing
the
position
of
his
head
upon
his
clasped
hands
but
that
pretty
well
papered
up
already
returned
geary
consulting
his
notes
you
could
very
well
raise
another
mortgage
on
that
i
forgotten
answered
vandover
there
the
block
in
the
mission
he
can
have
geary
began
to
tremble
with
excitement
it
looked
as
though
he
might
be
able
to
make
the
deal
after
all
but
the
next
instant
he
grew
suspicious
vandover
indifference
puzzled
him
might
he
not
have
some
game
of
his
own
the
idea
of
playing
off
his
cleverness
against
that
of
an
opponent
strung
his
nerves
in
an
instant
the
notion
of
an
impending
struggle
was
almost
an
inspiration
and
his
innate
desire
of
getting
the
better
of
a
competitor
even
though
it
was
his
closest
friend
aroused
his
wits
and
sharpened
his
faculties
like
a
stimulant
he
had
no
hesitancy
in
sacrificing
his
chum
it
was
business
now
friendship
ceased
to
be
a
factor
in
the
affair
ah
van
was
going
to
be
foxy
show
him
that
he
could
be
foxy
too
he
can
have
it
echoed
geary
you
do
mean
to
sign
it
over
to
him
bodily
oh
i
suppose
it
could
be
mortgaged
answered
vandover
yes
that
the
idea
returned
geary
you
want
me
to
figure
that
out
for
you
i
can
just
as
well
as
not
well
now
let
see
he
went
on
settling
himself
at
the
desk
and
figuring
upon
a
sheet
of
stamped
the
banks
will
never
give
you
more
than
two
thirds
of
the
appraised
value
that
as
much
as
we
can
expect
that
would
come
to
well
let
see
that
would
come
to
six
thousand
on
that
piece
then
you
could
mortgage
something
else
to
make
up
the
difference
would
it
be
more
than
six
thousand
asked
vandover
with
a
little
show
of
interest
i
think
that
block
has
been
appraised
at
something
over
twelve
thousand
ah
yes
returned
geary
putting
his
chin
in
the
air
that
was
your
agent
valuation
five
years
ago
but
you
know
property
out
there
in
fact
property
all
over
the
city
what
they
call
inside
property
has
been
going
right
down
for
the
last
ten
years
that
what
i
always
been
telling
you
you
could
possibly
get
more
than
nine
thousand
for
that
block
you
see
the
railroad
there
hurts
it
i
suppose
so
replied
vandover
i
heard
the
governor
say
as
much
in
his
time
of
course
exclaimed
geary
delighted
at
this
unexpected
turn
well
then
he
can
have
my
bonds
said
vandover
i
got
hundred
in
bonds
he
can
have
those
let
him
have
anything
he
wants
oh
do
touch
your
bonds
answered
geary
hang
on
to
those
bonds
are
always
good
bonds
you
do
want
to
sell
those
van
you
see
the
homestead
is
already
mortgaged
and
besides
you
know
too
that
the
banks
are
asking
an
awful
big
per
cent
for
mortgages
on
real
estate
it
seven
and
a
half
nowadays
do
sell
your
bonds
i
tell
you
why
bonds
are
always
good
they
never
depreciate
but
different
with
realty
especially
in
this
city
just
now
it
been
depreciating
ever
since
your
father
time
and
it
going
to
go
right
on
depreciating
if
you
want
to
sell
anything
sell
your
realty
before
it
gets
any
lower
now
you
do
want
to
sell
your
home
do
you
you
do
like
that
idea
you
lived
there
so
long
and
then
what
would
you
do
with
the
furniture
besides
the
rent
of
that
he
glanced
again
at
his
notes
is
bringing
you
in
a
good
hundred
and
a
month
if
you
got
to
sell
at
all
why
not
sell
your
mission
block
all
right
said
vandover
as
if
wearied
by
geary
clamour
i
sign
it
over
to
him
no
that
not
the
idea
at
all
geary
insisted
he
wants
the
ready
money
he
do
want
depreciated
real
estate
you
have
to
find
a
purchaser
in
the
next
week
if
you
possibly
can
in
such
a
short
time
and
make
over
the
money
to
wade
but
if
you
ca
sell
in
that
time
you
will
have
to
dig
up
ten
thousand
instead
of
eight
it
a
hard
position
for
you
van
it
just
a
chance
you
know
but
i
thought
i
would
give
you
the
benefit
of
that
chance
if
you
want
to
give
me
a
power
of
attorney
i
try
and
sell
it
for
you
i
guess
brunt
would
do
that
replied
vandover
yes
retorted
geary
watchful
as
a
lynx
but
they
would
charge
you
a
big
commission
of
course
would
think
of
asking
you
anything
more
than
the
actual
costs
i
am
afraid
that
they
would
try
to
sell
it
at
auction
too
if
they
knew
you
had
to
realize
on
it
in
so
short
a
time
and
it
would
go
for
a
mere
song
then
you
know
how
it
is
i
thought
inquired
vandover
that
you
wanted
that
property
yes
replied
geary
hesitating
i
i
did
want
to
buy
it
of
you
once
well
for
that
matter
i
do
now
but
you
know
how
it
is
with
me
i
might
as
well
sell
it
to
you
as
to
any
one
else
returned
vandover
well
now
it
like
this
van
said
geary
i
know
that
block
is
worth
nine
thousand
dollars
i
wo
deceive
you
but
i
can
only
give
you
eight
thousand
for
it
that
all
the
money
i
got
but
i
not
going
to
take
advantage
of
your
position
to
jew
you
down
i
want
the
block
i
admit
that
but
i
not
going
to
have
you
sacrifice
it
for
me
or
for
any
one
else
i
think
you
can
get
nine
thousand
for
it
i
know
you
could
if
we
had
a
little
more
time
and
i
not
sure
but
what
i
could
find
a
purchaser
for
you
within
the
next
week
that
would
give
you
nine
thousand
oh
i
do
care
charlie
i
sick
of
everything
eight
thousand
nine
thousand
anything
you
like
take
it
at
your
own
figure
geary
began
to
tremble
once
more
and
this
time
his
excitement
was
so
great
that
he
hardly
dared
to
trust
himself
to
speak
his
breath
grew
short
his
hands
in
his
pockets
twitched
nervously
and
curled
themselves
into
fists
his
heart
seemed
to
him
to
beat
high
in
his
throat
he
hesitated
long
pretending
to
deliberate
as
he
steadied
himself
vandover
remained
silent
his
hands
still
clasped
back
of
his
head
staring
at
the
opposite
wall
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
the
little
clock
began
to
strike
ten
i
do
know
van
said
geary
i
do
like
to
do
this
and
yet
i
would
like
to
help
you
out
of
this
muss
you
see
if
i
should
ever
benefit
by
the
property
you
would
feel
as
though
i
had
taken
advantage
of
you
at
this
time
and
worked
a
on
you
oh
i
look
out
for
that
returned
vandover
no
no
i
do
feel
quite
right
about
it
answered
geary
wagging
his
head
and
shutting
his
eyes
better
see
what
we
can
do
at
a
forced
sale
why
do
you
see
you
would
be
doing
me
a
favour
said
vandover
wearily
i
you
to
buy
the
block
i
do
care
what
your
figure
is
once
more
geary
hesitated
for
the
last
time
going
over
the
whole
deal
in
his
mind
from
beginning
to
end
testing
it
looking
for
weak
points
it
was
almost
perfect
suppose
the
boot
and
shoe
people
did
not
buy
the
lot
he
could
resell
it
elsewhere
even
below
its
appraised
value
and
yet
make
money
by
the
transaction
the
lot
was
cheap
at
ten
thousand
it
might
bring
twelve
even
as
an
ordinary
legitimate
speculation
it
was
to
be
desired
at
such
a
figure
suppose
the
boot
and
shoe
people
backed
out
entirely
suppose
even
he
could
not
find
another
purchaser
for
the
property
why
then
he
could
hold
on
to
it
the
income
from
the
rents
was
fully
per
cent
of
the
price
he
would
have
paid
for
it
well
van
he
said
at
last
making
a
slow
awkward
gesture
with
his
left
hand
all
the
fingers
extended
well
i
take
you
up
but
i
do
feel
as
though
i
should
he
suddenly
interrupted
himself
with
a
burst
of
sincerity
exclaiming
sure
old
man
if
i
had
nine
thousand
i
give
it
to
you
for
the
block
that
straight
goods
he
felt
that
he
was
conscientious
in
saying
this
it
was
true
he
would
have
given
nine
thousand
if
he
had
had
it
for
that
matter
he
might
have
given
ten
or
twelve
ca
we
settle
the
whole
matter
said
vandover
right
here
now
i
sick
of
it
sick
of
everything
let
get
it
done
with
geary
nearly
bounded
from
his
seat
he
had
been
wondering
how
he
might
accomplish
this
very
thing
all
right
he
said
briskly
no
reason
in
waiting
he
had
seen
to
it
that
he
should
be
prepared
to
close
the
sale
the
moment
that
vandover
was
willing
long
ago
when
he
had
first
had
the
idea
of
buying
the
block
he
had
spent
a
day
in
the
offices
of
the
county
recorder
the
tax
collector
and
the
assessor
assuring
himself
of
the
validity
of
the
title
and
only
two
days
ago
he
had
gone
over
the
matter
again
in
order
to
be
sure
that
no
encumbrances
had
been
added
to
the
block
in
the
meanwhile
he
found
nothing
the
title
was
clear
is
this
rather
rushing
the
thing
through
he
asked
maybe
you
might
regret
it
afterward
do
you
want
to
take
two
or
three
days
to
think
it
over
no
sure
now
persisted
geary
but
i
to
sell
before
three
days
answered
vandover
otherwise
he
want
ten
thousand
that
a
fact
admitted
the
other
well
he
went
on
if
your
made
up
why
we
can
go
right
ahead
as
i
say
there
no
reason
for
waiting
better
take
up
wade
while
he
in
the
mood
for
it
you
see
he
has
signed
any
proposition
as
yet
and
he
might
go
back
on
us
vandover
drew
a
long
breath
and
got
up
slowly
heavily
from
the
couch
saying
what
the
odds
to
me
what
i
sell
for
do
get
the
money
well
what
do
you
say
if
we
go
right
down
to
a
notary
office
and
put
this
thing
right
through
geary
suggested
come
on
then
have
you
got
your
abstract
here
the
abstract
of
the
block
vandover
nodded
better
bring
it
along
then
said
geary
the
office
of
the
notary
adjoined
those
of
the
firm
of
beale
storey
in
fact
he
was
in
a
sense
an
attaché
of
the
great
firm
and
transacted
a
great
deal
of
legal
business
for
them
vandover
and
geary
fell
upon
him
in
an
idle
moment
a
man
had
come
to
regulate
the
water
filter
which
took
the
place
of
an
ice
cooler
in
a
corner
of
one
of
the
anterooms
and
while
he
was
engaged
at
his
work
the
notary
stood
at
his
back
abusing
him
and
exclaiming
at
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
contrivance
the
notary
was
a
man
with
a
swollen
purple
face
he
had
a
toothpick
behind
each
ear
and
wore
an
office
coat
of
gray
linen
ripped
at
the
shoulders
then
the
transfer
was
made
it
was
all
settled
in
less
than
half
an
hour
unceremoniously
almost
hastily
for
the
sake
of
form
geary
signed
a
check
for
eight
thousand
dollars
which
vandover
in
his
turn
made
over
to
hiram
wade
the
notary
filled
out
a
deed
of
grant
bargain
and
sale
pasting
on
his
certificate
of
acknowledgment
as
soon
as
vandover
and
geary
had
signed
geary
took
the
abstract
thrusting
it
into
his
as
far
as
vandover
was
concerned
the
sale
was
complete
but
he
had
neither
his
properly
nor
its
equivalent
in
money
well
declared
geary
at
length
i
guess
that
all
there
is
to
be
done
i
get
a
release
from
old
man
wade
and
send
it
to
you
or
next
day
now
let
go
down
to
the
imperial
and
have
a
drink
on
it
they
went
out
but
the
notary
returned
to
the
anteroom
turning
the
spigot
of
the
filter
to
right
and
left
frowning
at
it
suspiciously
refusing
to
be
satisfied
chapter

that
particular
room
in
the
lick
house
was
well
toward
the
rear
of
the
building
on
one
of
the
upper
floors
and
from
its
window
one
looked
out
upon
a
vast
reach
of
roofs
that
rose
little
by
little
to
meet
the
abrupt
rise
of
telegraph
hill
it
was
a
sordid
and
grimy
wilderness
topped
with
a
gray
maze
of
wires
and
pierced
with
thousands
of
chimney
stacks
many
of
the
roofs
were
covered
with
tin
long
since
blackened
by
rust
and
soot
here
and
there
could
be
seen
clothes
hung
out
to
dry
occasionally
upon
the
flanking
walls
of
some
of
the
larger
buildings
was
displayed
an
enormous
painted
sign
a
violent
contrast
of
intense
black
and
staring
white
amidst
the
sooty
brown
and
gray
advertising
some
tobacco
some
newspaper
or
some
department
store
not
far
in
the
distance
two
tall
smokestacks
of
blackened
tin
rose
high
in
the
air
above
the
roof
of
a
steam
laundry
one
very
large
like
the
stack
of
a
cunarder
the
other
slender
graceful
with
a
top
all
day
and
all
night
these
stacks
were
smoking
from
the
first
the
larger
one
rolled
a
heavy
black
smoke
very
gloomy
waving
with
a
slow
and
continued
movement
like
the
plume
of
some
sullen
warrior
but
the
other
one
the
tall
and
slender
pipe
threw
off
a
series
of
little
white
puffs
three
at
a
time
that
rose
buoyant
and
joyous
into
the
air
like
so
many
white
doves
vanishing
at
last
melting
away
in
the
higher
sunshine
only
to
be
followed
by
another
flight
they
came
three
at
a
time
the
pipe
tossing
them
out
with
a
sharp
gay
sound
like
a
note
of
laughter
interrupted
by
a
cough
but
the
interior
of
the
room
presented
the
usual
dreary
aspect
of
the
hotel
bedroom
cheerless
lamentable
the
walls
were
whitewashed
and
bare
of
pictures
or
ornaments
and
the
floor
was
covered
with
a
dull
red
carpet
the
furniture
was
a
set
all
the
pieces
having
a
family
resemblance
on
entering
one
saw
the
bed
standing
against
the
wall
a
huge
double
bed
with
the
name
of
the
hotel
in
the
corners
of
its
spread
and
pillowcases
in
the
exact
middle
of
the
room
underneath
the
gas
fixture
was
the
and
upon
it
a
pitcher
of
the
blank
white
monotony
of
one
side
of
the
room
was
jarred
upon
by
the
grate
and
mantelpiece
iron
painted
black
while
on
the
mantelpiece
itself
stood
a
little
porcelain
matchsafe
with
ribbed
sides
in
the
form
of
a
truncated
cone
precisely
opposite
the
chimney
was
the
bureau
flanked
on
one
side
by
the
door
of
the
closet
and
on
the
other
in
the
corner
of
the
room
by
the
stationary
washstand
with
its
new
cake
of
soap
and
its
three
clean
glossy
towels
on
the
wall
to
the
left
of
the
door
was
the
electric
bell
and
the
directions
for
using
it
and
tacked
upon
the
door
itself
a
card
as
to
the
hours
for
meals
the
rules
of
the
hotel
and
the
extract
of
the
code
defining
the
liabilities
of
innkeepers
all
printed
in
bright
red
everything
was
clean
defiantly
aggressively
clean
and
there
was
a
clean
smell
of
new
soap
in
the
air
but
the
room
was
bare
of
any
personality
of
the
hundreds
who
had
lived
there
perhaps
suffered
and
died
there
not
a
trace
not
a
suggestion
remained
their
different
characters
had
not
left
the
least
impress
upon
its
air
or
appearance
only
a
few
hairpins
were
scattered
on
the
bottom
of
one
of
the
bureau
drawers
and
two
forgotten
medicine
bottles
still
remained
upon
the
top
shelf
of
the
closet
this
had
been
the
appearance
of
vandover
new
home
when
he
had
first
come
to
it
after
leaving
his
suite
of
rooms
in
the
huge
apartment
house
on
sutter
street
he
had
lived
here
now
for
something
over
a
year
it
had
all
commenced
with
the
seizure
of
his
furniture
by
the
proprietors
of
the
apartment
house
almost
before
he
knew
it
he
owed
for
six
months
room
and
board
when
the
extras
were
added
to
this
bill
it
swelled
to
nearly
a
thousand
dollars
at
first
he
would
not
believe
it
it
was
not
possible
that
so
large
a
bill
could
accumulate
without
his
knowledge
he
declared
there
was
a
mistake
tossing
back
the
bill
to
the
clerk
who
had
presented
it
and
shaking
his
head
incredulously
this
other
became
angry
offered
to
show
the
books
of
the
house
the
manager
was
called
in
and
attempted
to
prove
the
clerk
statement
by
figures
dates
and
extracts
from
the
entries
vandover
was
confused
by
their
noise
and
grew
angry
in
his
turn
vociferating
that
he
did
not
propose
to
be
cheated
the
others
retorted
in
a
rage
the
interview
ended
in
a
scene
but
in
the
end
they
gained
their
point
they
were
right
and
at
length
vandover
was
brought
around
to
see
that
he
was
in
the
wrong
but
he
had
no
ready
money
and
while
he
hesitated
unwilling
to
part
with
any
of
his
bonds
or
to
put
an
additional
mortgage
upon
the
homestead
the
hotel
after
two
warnings
suddenly
seized
upon
his
furniture
what
a
misery
in
a
moment
of
time
it
was
all
taken
from
him
all
the
lovely
all
the
heavy
pieces
all
the
little
articles
of
which
he
had
bought
with
such
intense
delight
and
amongst
which
he
had
lived
with
such
happiness
such
contentment
such
pleasure
everything
went
the
renaissance
portraits
the
the
chair
in
which
the
old
gentleman
had
died
the
assyrian
and
worst
of
all
the
stove
the
famous
tiled
stove
the
delightful
cheery
iron
stove
with
the
beautified
flamboyant
ornaments
for
the
first
few
months
after
the
seizure
vandover
was
furious
with
rage
and
disappointment
persuaded
that
he
could
never
live
anywhere
but
in
just
such
a
room
it
was
as
if
he
had
been
uprooted
and
cast
away
upon
some
barren
uncongenial
soil
his
new
room
in
the
hotel
filled
him
with
horror
and
for
a
long
time
he
used
it
only
as
a
place
where
he
could
sleep
and
for
a
long
time
even
his
pliable
character
refused
to
fit
itself
to
such
surroundings
refused
to
be
content
between
four
enormous
white
walls
a
stuccoed
ceiling
and
a
dark
red
carpet
he
passed
most
of
his
time
elsewhere
reading
the
papers
at
the
mechanics
library
in
the
morning
and
in
the
afternoon
sitting
about
the
hotel
office
and
parlours
until
it
was
time
to
take
his
usual
little
four
stroll
on
kearney
and
market
streets
he
had
long
since
become
a
familiar
figure
on
this
promenade
even
the
women
and
girls
of
type
had
ceased
to
be
interested
in
this
tall
thin
young
man
with
the
tired
heavy
eyes
and
face
one
day
however
a
curious
incident
did
for
a
moment
invest
vandover
with
a
sudden
dramatic
interest
it
was
just
after
he
had
moved
down
to
the
lick
house
about
a
month
after
he
had
sold
the
block
in
the
mission
vandover
was
standing
at
lotta
fountain
at
the
corner
of
kearney
and
market
streets
interested
in
watching
a
policeman
and
two
boys
reharnessing
a
horse
after
its
tumble
all
at
once
he
fell
over
flat
into
the
street
jostling
one
of
the
flower
venders
and
nearly
upsetting
him
he
struck
the
ground
with
a
sodden
shock
his
arms
doubled
under
him
his
hat
rolling
away
into
the
mud
bewildered
he
picked
himself
up
very
few
had
seen
him
fall
but
a
little
crowd
gathered
for
all
that
one
asked
if
the
man
was
drunk
and
vandover
terrified
lest
the
policeman
should
call
the
patrol
wagon
hurried
off
to
a
basement
barber
shop
near
by
where
he
brushed
his
clothes
still
bewildered
confused
wondering
how
it
had
happened
the
fearful
nervous
crisis
which
vandover
had
undergone
had
passed
off
slowly
little
by
little
bit
by
bit
he
had
got
himself
in
hand
again
however
the
queer
numbness
in
his
head
remained
and
as
soon
as
he
concentrated
his
attention
on
any
certain
line
of
thought
as
soon
as
he
had
read
for
any
length
of
time
especially
if
late
at
night
the
numbness
increased
somewhere
back
of
his
eyes
a
strange
blurring
mist
would
seem
to
rise
he
would
find
it
impossible
to
keep
his
mind
fixed
upon
any
subject
the
words
of
a
printed
page
would
little
by
little
lose
their
meaning
at
first
this
had
been
a
source
of
infinite
terror
to
him
he
fancied
it
to
be
the
symptoms
of
some
approaching
mental
collapse
but
as
the
weeks
went
by
and
nothing
unusual
occurred
he
became
used
to
it
and
refused
to
let
it
worry
him
if
it
made
his
head
feel
queer
to
read
the
remedy
was
easy
enough
he
simply
would
not
read
and
though
he
had
been
a
great
reader
and
at
one
time
had
been
used
to
spend
many
delightful
afternoons
lost
in
the
pages
of
a
novel
he
now
gave
it
all
up
with
an
easy
indifference
but
besides
all
this
the
attack
had
left
him
with
nerves
all
unstrung
even
his
little
afternoon
walk
on
kearney
and
market
streets
exhausted
him
any
trifling
and
sudden
noise
the
closing
of
a
door
the
striking
of
a
clock
would
cause
him
to
start
from
his
place
with
a
gasp
and
a
quick
catch
at
the
heart
toward
evening
this
little
spasm
of
nerves
would
sometimes
come
upon
him
even
when
there
was
nothing
to
cause
it
and
now
he
could
no
longer
drop
off
to
sleep
without
first
undergoing
a
whole
series
of
these
recoils
and
starts
that
would
sometimes
bring
him
violently
up
to
a
sitting
posture
his
breath
coming
short
and
quick
his
heart
galloping
startled
at
he
knew
not
what
at
first
he
had
intended
to
see
a
doctor
but
he
had
put
off
carrying
his
intention
into
effect
until
he
had
grown
accustomed
to
the
whole
matter
otherwise
he
was
well
enough
his
appetite
was
good
and
when
he
finally
did
get
to
sleep
he
would
not
wake
up
for
a
good
eight
hours
one
evening
however
about
three
months
after
the
first
crisis
and
just
as
vandover
was
becoming
well
accustomed
to
the
condition
of
body
and
mind
in
which
it
had
left
him
the
second
attack
came
on
it
was
fearful
much
worse
than
on
the
first
occasion
and
this
time
there
was
no
room
for
doubt
vandover
knew
that
for
the
moment
he
was
actually
insane
ellis
had
been
with
vandover
most
of
that
afternoon
the
two
had
been
playing
cards
in
vandover
room
until
nearly
six
all
the
afternoon
they
had
been
drinking
whisky
while
they
played
and
by
neither
of
them
had
any
appetite
ellis
refused
to
go
down
declaring
that
if
he
should
eat
now
it
would
make
him
sick
vandover
went
down
alone
but
once
in
the
he
found
that
could
not
eat
either
however
he
knew
that
it
was
not
the
whisky
for
two
days
his
appetite
had
been
failing
him
the
smell
of
food
revolted
him
and
he
left
the
going
up
to
his
bare
and
lamentable
room
with
the
feeling
that
he
was
about
to
undergo
a
long
spell
of
sickness
in
the
deserted
hall
between
the
elevator
and
the
door
of
his
room
the
second
crisis
came
upon
him
all
at
once
it
was
so
sudden
that
it
was
as
if
some
enemy
had
leaped
upon
his
back
springing
out
of
the
shadow
gripping
him
from
behind
holding
him
close
once
more
the
hysteria
shook
him
like
a
dry
leaf
the
little
nervous
starts
came
so
fast
that
they
ran
together
mingling
to
form
one
long
thrill
of
terror
the
blind
unreasoning
terror
of
something
unknown
the
numbness
weighed
down
upon
his
brain
until
consciousness
dwindled
to
a
mere
point
and
mercifully
dulled
the
torture
of
his
crisping
nerves
it
seemed
to
him
that
his
hands
and
head
were
rapidly
swelling
to
enormous
size
all
this
he
had
felt
before
it
was
his
old
enemy
but
now
with
this
second
attack
began
a
new
and
even
stranger
sensation
in
his
distorted
wits
he
fancied
that
he
was
in
some
manner
changing
that
he
was
becoming
another
man
worse
than
that
it
seemed
to
him
that
he
was
no
longer
human
that
he
was
sinking
all
in
a
moment
to
the
level
of
some
dreadful
beast
later
on
in
that
same
evening
ellis
met
young
haight
coming
out
of
one
of
the
theatres
and
told
him
a
story
that
haight
did
not
believe
ellis
was
very
pale
and
he
seemed
to
young
haight
to
be
trying
to
keep
down
some
tremendous
excitement
if
he
was
drunk
said
ellis
it
was
the
strangest
drunk
i
ever
saw
he
came
back
into
the
room
on
all
fours
not
on
his
hands
and
knees
you
understand
but
running
along
the
floor
upon
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
his
toes
and
he
pushed
the
door
of
the
room
open
with
his
head
nuzzling
at
the
crack
like
any
dog
oh
it
was
horrible
do
know
what
the
matter
with
van
you
should
have
seen
him
his
head
was
hanging
way
down
and
swinging
from
side
to
side
as
he
came
along
it
shook
all
his
hair
over
his
eyes
he
kept
rattling
his
teeth
together
and
every
now
and
then
he
would
say
way
down
in
his
throat
so
it
sounded
like
growls
wolf
wolf
i
got
hold
of
him
and
pulled
him
up
to
his
feet
it
was
just
as
though
he
was
asleep
and
when
i
shook
him
he
came
to
all
at
once
and
began
to
laugh
the
matter
van
says
i
are
you
crawling
on
the
floor
that
way
for
damned
if
i
know
says
he
rubbing
his
eyes
guess
i
must
have
been
out
of
my
head
too
much
whisky
then
he
says
me
to
bed
will
you
bandy
i
feel
all
gone
in
well
i
put
him
to
bed
and
went
out
to
get
some
bromide
of
potassium
he
said
that
made
him
sleep
and
kept
his
nerves
steady
coming
back
i
met
a
just
outside
of
van
door
and
told
him
to
ask
the
hotel
doctor
to
come
up
you
see
i
had
not
opened
the
door
of
the
room
yet
and
while
i
was
talking
to
the
i
could
hear
the
sound
of
something
going
back
and
forth
inside
the
room
when
i
got
inside
there
was
van
perfectly
naked
going
back
and
forth
along
the
wall
swinging
his
head
very
low
grumbling
to
himself
but
he
came
to
again
as
soon
as
i
shook
him
and
seemed
dreadfully
ashamed
and
went
to
bed
all
right
he
got
to
sleep
finally
and
i
left
the
doctor
with
him
to
come
out
and
get
something
for
my
own
nerves
what
did
the
doctor
say
was
the
matter
asked
young
haight
in
horror
i
never
heard
the
name
before
some
kind
of
nervous
disease
i
guess
van
had
been
hitting
up
a
pretty
rapid
gait
and
then
i
suppose
he
had
a
good
deal
to
worry
him
too
once
more
the
attack
passed
off
leaving
vandover
exhausted
his
nerves
all
jangling
his
health
impaired
every
day
he
seemed
to
grow
thinner
great
brown
hollows
grew
under
his
eyes
and
the
skin
of
his
forehead
looked
blue
and
tightly
drawn
by
degrees
a
deep
gloom
overcame
him
permanently
nothing
could
interest
him
nothing
seemed
worth
while
not
only
were
his
nerves
out
of
tune
but
they
were
jaded
deadened
slack
they
were
like
harpstrings
that
had
been
played
upon
so
long
and
so
violently
that
now
they
could
no
longer
vibrate
unless
swept
with
a
very
whirlwind
as
he
had
foreseen
vandover
had
returned
again
to
vice
to
the
vice
that
was
knitted
into
him
now
fibre
for
fibre
to
the
ways
of
the
brute
that
by
degrees
was
taking
entire
possession
of
him
but
he
no
longer
found
pleasure
even
in
vice
once
it
had
been
his
amusement
now
it
was
his
occupation
it
was
the
only
thing
that
seemed
to
ease
the
horrible
nervousness
that
of
late
had
begun
to
prey
upon
him
constantly
but
though
nothing
could
amuse
him
on
the
other
hand
nothing
could
worry
him
in
the
end
the
very
riot
of
his
nerves
ceased
even
to
annoy
him
he
had
arrived
at
a
state
of
absolute
indifference
he
had
so
often
rearranged
his
pliable
nature
to
suit
his
changing
environment
that
at
last
he
found
that
he
could
be
content
in
almost
any
circumstances
he
had
no
pleasures
no
cares
no
ambitions
no
regrets
no
hopes
it
was
mere
passive
existence
an
inert
plantlike
vegetation
the
pause
before
the
final
decay
the
last
inevitable
rot
one
day
after
he
had
been
living
nearly
a
year
at
the
lick
house
adams
brunt
the
real
estate
agents
sent
him
word
that
they
had
an
offer
for
his
property
on
california
street
it
was
the
homestead
the
english
gentleman
the
president
of
the
fruit
syndicate
who
had
rented
the
house
of
vandover
was
now
willing
to
buy
it
his
business
was
by
this
time
on
a
firm
and
paying
basis
and
he
had
decided
to
make
his
home
in
san
francisco
he
offered
thousand
dollars
for
the
house
including
the
furniture
brunt
had
several
talks
with
vandover
and
easily
induced
him
to
sell
you
can
figure
it
out
for
yourself
vandover
he
said
as
he
pointed
out
his
own
calculations
to
him
property
has
been
going
down
in
the
city
for
the
last
ten
years
and
it
will
continue
to
do
so
until
we
can
get
a
competing
railroad
through
better
sell
when
you
can
and
thousand
is
a
fair
price
of
course
you
will
have
to
pay
off
the
mortgage
you
wo
get
but
about
fifteen
thousand
out
of
it
but
at
the
same
time
you
wo
have
to
pay
the
interest
on
that
mortgage
to
the
banks
that
will
be
so
much
saved
a
month
add
that
to
what
you
could
get
for
your
fifteen
thousand
at
say
per
and
you
would
have
a
monthly
income
nearly
equal
to
the
present
rent
of
the
house
and
much
more
certain
too
suppose
your
tenant
should
go
out
then
where
would
you
be
all
right
all
right
answered
vandover
nodding
his
head
vaguely
go
ahead
do
care
he
parted
from
his
old
home
with
as
much
indifference
as
he
had
parted
from
his
block
in
the
mission
vandover
signed
the
deed
that
made
him
homeless
and
at
about
the
same
time
the
first
payment
was
made
ten
thousand
dollars
was
deposited
in
one
of
the
banks
to
his
credit
and
a
check
sent
to
him
for
the
amount
the
very
next
day
vandover
drew
against
it
for
five
hundred
dollars
at
one
time
he
had
had
an
ambition
to
buy
back
his
furniture
from
the
huge
apartment
house
in
which
he
had
formerly
lived
and
with
it
to
make
his
cheerless
bedroom
in
the
lick
house
seem
more
like
a
home
he
felt
it
almost
as
a
dishonour
to
have
strangers
using
this
furniture
sitting
in
the
great
leather
chair
in
which
the
old
gentleman
had
died
staring
stupidly
at
his
renaissance
portraits
and
copies
of
assyrian
above
all
it
was
torture
to
think
that
other
hands
than
his
own
would
tend
the
famous
tiled
and
flamboyant
stove
a
stove
that
had
its
moods
its
caprices
like
any
living
person
a
stove
that
had
to
be
coaxed
and
humoured
a
stove
that
he
alone
could
understand
he
had
told
himself
that
if
ever
again
he
should
have
money
enough
he
would
bring
back
this
furniture
to
him
at
first
its
absence
had
been
a
matter
for
the
keenest
regret
and
grief
he
had
been
so
used
to
pleasant
surroundings
that
he
languished
in
his
new
quarters
as
in
a
prison
his
indulgent
luxurious
character
continually
hungered
after
subdued
harmonious
colours
pictures
ornaments
and
soft
rugs
his
imagination
was
forever
covering
the
white
walls
with
rough
paper
and
placing
screens
divans
and
in
different
parts
of
the
cold
bare
room
one
morning
he
had
even
gone
so
far
as
to
pin
about
the
walls
little
placards
which
he
had
painted
with
a
twisted
roll
of
the
hotel
dipped
into
the
inkstand
here
mona
lisa
here
stove
here
here
he
had
left
them
up
there
ever
since
in
spite
of
the
chambermaid
protests
and
ellis
clumsy
satire
now
however
he
had
plenty
of
money
he
would
have
his
furniture
back
within
the
week
he
came
back
from
the
bank
the
money
in
his
pocket
and
went
up
to
the
room
directly
with
some
vague
intention
of
writing
to
the
proprietors
of
the
apartment
house
at
once
but
as
he
shut
the
door
behind
him
leaning
his
back
against
it
and
looking
about
he
suddenly
realized
that
his
desire
was
passed
he
had
become
so
used
to
these
surroundings
that
it
now
no
longer
made
any
difference
to
him
whether
or
not
they
were
cheerless
lamentable
barren
it
was
like
all
his
other
little
ambitions
he
had
lost
the
taste
for
them
nothing
made
much
difference
after
all
his
money
had
come
too
late
why
should
he
spend
his
five
hundred
dollars
on
something
that
could
no
longer
amuse
him
it
would
be
much
wiser
to
spend
it
all
in
having
a
good
time
somewhere
champagne
dinners
with
flossie
or
betting
on
the
races
he
did
not
know
exactly
what
it
was
true
that
even
these
alternatives
would
not
amuse
him
very
much
he
would
fall
back
upon
them
as
things
of
habit
for
that
matter
everything
was
an
and
vandover
began
to
long
for
some
new
pleasure
some
violent
untried
excitement
since
the
sale
of
the
block
in
the
mission
he
had
seen
but
little
of
geary
young
haight
had
not
been
his
companion
since
the
time
when
turner
ravis
had
broken
with
him
but
little
by
little
he
had
begun
to
associate
with
ellis
and
his
friend
the
dummy
almost
every
evening
the
three
were
together
sometimes
at
the
theatre
sometimes
in
the
back
rooms
of
the
imperial
sometimes
even
in
the
parlours
of
certain
houses
amid
the
murmur
of
heavy
silks
and
the
rustle
of
stiffly
starched
skirts
at
times
they
would
be
drunk
four
nights
of
the
week
and
on
these
occasions
it
was
tacitly
understood
between
ellis
and
vandover
that
they
should
try
to
get
the
dummy
so
full
that
he
could
talk
however
ellis
vice
was
gambling
he
and
the
dummy
often
passed
the
whole
night
over
their
cards
and
as
vandover
came
more
and
more
under
ellis
influence
succumbing
to
it
as
weakly
as
he
had
succumbed
to
the
influence
of
charlie
geary
he
began
to
join
these
parties
they
played
van
john
at
five
dollars
a
corner
vandover
won
as
often
as
he
lost
but
the
habit
of
cards
grew
upon
him
steadily
toward
eleven
the
evening
of
the
day
upon
which
he
had
drawn
his
five
hundred
vandover
went
around
to
the
imperial
looking
for
his
two
friends
he
found
ellis
drinking
whisky
all
alone
in
one
of
the
little
rooms
as
was
his
custom
fifteen
minutes
later
the
dummy
and
flossie
joined
them
flossie
had
grown
stouter
since
vandover
had
first
known
her
nearly
ten
years
ago
she
had
a
double
chin
and
puffy
discoloured
pockets
had
come
under
her
eyes
now
her
hair
was
dyed
her
cheeks
and
lips
rouged
and
her
former
air
of
health
and
good
spirits
gone
she
never
laughed
she
had
smoked
so
many
cigarettes
that
now
her
voice
hardly
rose
above
a
whisper
at
one
time
she
had
been
accustomed
to
boast
that
she
never
drank
and
it
had
been
one
of
her
peculiarities
for
which
she
was
well
known
but
on
this
occasion
she
joined
ellis
in
his
whisky
she
had
long
since
departed
from
her
rule
of
temperance
and
nowadays
drank
nothing
else
but
whisky
she
had
even
become
well
known
for
the
quantity
of
whisky
she
could
drink
for
half
an
hour
the
four
sat
around
the
little
table
talking
about
the
new
enormous
sutro
baths
that
were
building
at
that
time
after
a
while
flossie
left
them
and
the
dummy
began
to
imitate
the
motions
of
some
one
dealing
cards
looking
at
the
same
time
inquiringly
into
their
faces
how
about
that
bandy
asked
vandover
shall
we
have
a
game
the
man
of
few
words
merely
nodded
his
head
and
drank
off
the
rest
of
his
whisky
at
a
swallow
they
all
went
up
to
vandover
room
vandover
got
out
the
cards
the
celluloid
chips
and
a
fresh
box
of
cigars
the
dummy
held
up
two
fingers
of
his
left
hand
shutting
them
together
afterward
with
his
right
and
making
a
hissing
noise
between
his
teeth
he
raised
his
eyebrows
at
vandover
vandover
understood
and
ringing
for
a
ordered
up
three
bottles
of
soda
in
siphon
bottles
the
game
was
et
or
as
they
called
it
van
john
they
cut
for
banker
ellis
turned
the
first
ace
and
vandover
bought
the
bank
from
him
for
the
first
hour
they
were
very
jolly
laughing
and
talking
back
and
forth
at
each
other
the
dummy
especially
communicative
continually
scribbling
upon
his
holding
it
toward
the
others
but
it
was
not
necessary
for
them
to
put
their
replies
in
writing
he
understood
from
watching
the
movement
of
their
lips
the
luck
had
not
declared
itself
as
yet
none
of
them
had
lost
or
won
very
much
the
brought
up
the
siphons
the
dummy
took
off
his
coat
and
the
other
two
followed
his
example
they
were
all
smoking
and
an
acrid
blue
haze
filled
the
room
making
a
golden
blur
about
each
gas
globe
but
little
by
little
the
passion
of
the
gambling
seized
upon
them
the
luck
had
begun
to
declare
itself
alternating
between
ellis
and
the
dummy
vandover
lost
steadily
twice
already
his
bank
had
been
broken
and
he
had
been
forced
to
buy
in
the
play
resolved
itself
into
two
parts
vandover
struggling
to
keep
up
with
the
game
on
one
side
and
on
the
other
a
great
battle
going
on
between
ellis
and
the
dummy
long
since
they
had
ceased
to
laugh
and
not
a
word
was
spoken
each
one
was
absorbed
in
the
game
intently
watching
the
cards
as
they
were
turned
the
four
of
the
chandelier
flared
steadily
filling
the
room
with
a
crude
raw
light
that
was
reflected
with
a
blinding
glare
from
the
four
staring
white
walls
the
room
grew
hot
the
layer
of
foul
warm
air
just
beneath
the
ceiling
slowly
descending
the
acrid
tobacco
smoke
no
longer
rose
but
hung
in
long
threads
just
above
their
heads
they
played
on
steadily
a
great
stillness
grew
in
the
room
a
stillness
broken
only
by
the
little
rattle
of
chips
and
subdued
rustle
of
the
shuffled
cards
once
vandover
stopped
just
time
enough
to
throw
off
his
vest
his
collar
and
his
scarf
for
a
moment
the
luck
seemed
about
to
settle
on
him
he
was
still
banking
and
twice
in
succession
he
drew
van
john
both
times
winning
heavily
from
the
dummy
and
a
little
later
tied
ellis
at
twenty
when
the
latter
had
staked
on
nearly
a
third
of
his
chips
but
in
the
next
hands
ellis
got
back
the
lead
again
winning
from
both
the
others
from
this
time
on
it
was
settled
the
luck
suddenly
declared
openly
for
ellis
the
dummy
and
vandover
merely
fighting
for
second
place
ellis
held
his
lead
at
one
he
was
nearly
fifty
dollars
ahead
of
the
game
the
profound
silence
of
the
room
seemed
to
widen
about
them
after
midnight
the
noises
in
the
hotel
the
ringing
of
distant
call
bells
the
rattle
of
dishes
from
the
kitchens
the
clash
of
closing
elevator
doors
gradually
ceased
only
at
long
intervals
one
heard
the
hurried
step
of
a
in
the
hall
outside
and
the
clink
of
the
ice
in
the
water
pitcher
that
he
was
carrying
outside
a
great
quiet
seemed
in
a
sense
to
rise
from
the
sleeping
city
the
noises
in
the
streets
died
away
the
last
electric
car
went
down
kearney
street
getting
under
way
with
a
long
minor
wail
occasionally
a
belated
coupé
a
nighthawk
rattled
over
the
cobbles
while
close
by
from
over
the
roofs
the
tall
slender
stack
upon
the
steam
laundry
puffed
incessantly
three
puffs
at
a
time
like
some
kind
of
halting
clock
the
room
became
more
and
more
close
none
of
them
would
take
the
time
to
open
the
window
from
ceiling
to
floor
the
air
was
fouled
by
their
breathing
by
the
tobacco
smoke
and
by
the
four
flaring
by
this
time
a
sombre
excitement
burnt
in
their
eyes
and
quivered
in
their
fingers
never
for
an
instant
did
their
glances
leave
the
cards
ellis
was
drinking
whisky
again
mixed
with
soda
his
hand
continually
groping
for
the
glass
with
a
mechanical
gesture
the
dummy
was
so
excited
he
could
not
keep
his
cigar
alight
and
contented
himself
with
chewing
the
end
with
an
hysterical
motion
of
his
jaws
the
perspiration
stood
in
beads
on
the
back
of
vandover
hands
running
down
in
tiny
rivulets
between
his
fingers
his
teeth
were
shut
close
together
and
he
was
breathing
short
through
his
nose
a
fine
trembling
had
seized
upon
his
hands
so
that
the
chips
in
his
palm
rattled
like
castanets
in
the
stale
and
murky
atmosphere
of
the
overheated
room
in
the
midst
of
the
vast
silence
of
the
sleeping
city
they
played
on
steadily
then
they
began
to
plunge
agreeing
to
play
a
no
limit
game
and
raising
the
value
of
a
red
chip
to
ten
dollars
at
times
they
even
played
with
the
coins
themselves
when
their
chips
were
exhausted
vandover
had
lost
all
his
ready
money
and
now
for
a
long
time
had
been
gambling
with
the
five
hundred
dollars
he
had
that
day
drawn
from
the
bank
ellis
had
practically
put
the
dummy
out
of
the
play
and
now
the
game
was
between
him
and
vandover
ellis
was
banking
and
at
length
offered
to
sell
the
bank
to
either
one
of
them
for
the
first
time
since
the
real
gambling
began
they
commenced
to
talk
a
little
but
in
short
brief
sentences
answering
by
monosyllables
and
by
signs
how
much
for
the
bank
inquired
ellis
holding
up
the
deck
and
looking
from
one
to
the
other
instantly
the
dummy
wrote
ten
dollars
in
figures
on
his
pad
and
showed
it
to
him
vandover
looked
at
what
the
dummy
had
written
and
said
fifteen
twenty
scribbled
the
dummy
as
he
watched
vandover
lips
form
the
word
returned
vandover
the
dummy
hesitated
a
moment
and
then
wrote
thirty
ellis
shook
his
head
saying
i
keep
the
bank
myself
at
that
forty
dollars
cried
vandover
the
dummy
shook
his
head
leaning
back
in
his
chair
ellis
shoved
the
pack
across
the
table
to
vandover
and
vandover
gave
him
a
bill
and
two
red
chips
on
vandover
very
first
deal
around
the
dummy
stood
on
the
second
card
for
twelve
chips
ellis
bet
on
his
first
card
and
as
he
got
the
second
turned
both
of
them
face
up
he
had
two
jacks
on
each
of
these
he
said
i
draw
to
each
one
vandover
looked
at
his
own
card
it
was
a
all
at
once
he
grew
reckless
and
seized
with
a
sudden
folly
resolved
to
attempt
a
great
double
up
he
ordered
the
dummy
set
out
twelve
more
chips
and
ellis
another
fifty
making
his
bet
an
even
hundred
vandover
began
to
deal
to
ellis
on
the
first
jack
ellis
drew
eighteen
and
stood
at
that
the
first
card
that
fell
to
the
second
jack
was
an
ace
van
john
he
remarked
quietly
the
dummy
drew
three
cards
and
stood
on
nineteen
vandover
turned
up
his
own
card
and
began
to
deal
for
himself
he
already
had
a
ten
now
he
drew
a
and
king
in
succession
the
bank
pays
he
exclaimed
he
paid
the
dummy
chips
he
gave
ellis
fifty
for
the
eighteen
he
had
drawn
on
his
first
jack
and
one
hundred
for
the
van
john
upon
the
second
since
the
latter
combination
called
for
double
the
amount
wagered
besides
this
the
bank
was
lost
to
him
including
the
forty
that
he
had
paid
for
the
bank
he
had
lost
in
all
two
hundred
and
fourteen
dollars
never
in
his
life
had
vandover
played
so
high
a
game
never
before
had
he
won
or
lost
more
than
fifty
dollars
at
a
sitting
but
he
was
content
to
have
it
thus
here
at
last
was
the
new
pleasure
for
which
he
had
longed
the
fresh
violent
excitement
that
alone
could
rouse
his
jaded
nerves
the
one
thing
that
could
amuse
him
however
the
failure
of
his
had
left
him
without
chips
he
was
out
of
the
game
he
decided
that
he
would
stop
more
than
half
of
his
five
hundred
dollars
was
gone
already
he
drank
off
a
glass
of
soda
the
dregs
of
one
of
the
siphon
bottles
and
got
up
yawning
shivering
a
little
and
stretching
his
arms
high
above
the
other
two
played
on
steadily
the
dummy
began
to
gain
slowly
upon
ellis
playing
very
cautiously
betting
only
upon
face
cards
aces
and
twice
ellis
offered
to
sell
him
the
bank
but
he
refused
fearful
lest
it
should
change
his
luck
vandover
sat
behind
the
dummy
chair
watching
his
game
but
at
length
worn
out
he
began
to
drop
off
to
sleep
waking
every
now
and
then
with
a
sudden
leap
and
recoil
of
all
his
nerves
an
hour
later
the
persistent
scratching
of
a
match
awoke
him
ellis
and
the
dummy
were
still
playing
and
the
dummy
was
once
more
relighting
the
stump
of
his
cigar
ellis
continued
to
deal
winning
at
almost
every
play
a
great
pile
of
chips
and
money
lay
at
his
elbow
for
a
few
minutes
vandover
watched
the
dummy
game
leaning
forward
in
his
chair
his
elbows
on
his
knees
but
it
was
evident
that
the
dummy
had
lost
his
nerve
ellis
continued
winnings
had
at
length
demoralized
him
at
one
time
he
would
bet
heavily
on
worthless
cards
and
at
another
would
throw
back
nines
and
tens
for
no
apparent
reason
finally
ellis
dealt
him
a
queen
which
he
kept
betting
ten
chips
his
next
card
was
a
he
signed
to
ellis
that
he
would
stand
ellis
drew
twenty
in
three
cards
vandover
could
not
restrain
an
exclamation
of
impatience
at
the
dummy
stupidity
what
a
fool
a
man
must
be
to
stand
on
seventeen
with
only
two
in
the
game
all
at
once
he
tossed
twenty
dollars
across
the
table
to
ellis
saying
give
me
that
in
chips
i
coming
in
again
once
more
he
resumed
his
seat
at
the
table
and
ellis
dealt
him
a
hand
but
vandover
interruption
had
for
an
instant
taken
ellis
mind
from
the
game
he
stirred
in
his
chair
and
looked
about
the
room
puffing
out
his
cheeks
and
blowing
between
his
lips
say
this
room
is
close
enough
to
strangle
you
open
the
window
behind
you
van
you
nearest
to
it
as
vandover
raised
the
curtain
he
uttered
a
cry
look
here
will
you
it
was
morning
the
city
was
flooded
by
the
light
of
the
sun
already
an
hour
high
the
sky
was
without
a
cloud
over
the
roofs
and
amongst
the
gray
maze
of
telegraph
wires
swarms
of
sparrows
were
chittering
hoarsely
and
as
vandover
raised
the
window
he
could
hear
the
newsboys
far
below
in
the
streets
chanting
the
morning
papers
come
on
van
exclaimed
ellis
impatiently
we
waiting
for
you
that
night
decided
it
from
that
time
on
vandover
only
pleasure
was
gambling
night
and
day
he
sat
over
the
cards
the
passion
growing
upon
him
as
he
continued
to
lose
for
his
ill
luck
was
extraordinary
it
was
a
veritable
mania
a
wild
blind
frenzy
that
knew
no
limit
at
first
he
had
contented
himself
with
a
game
in
which
twenty
or
thirty
dollars
was
as
much
as
he
could
win
or
lose
at
a
sitting
but
soon
this
palled
upon
him
he
was
obliged
to
raise
the
stakes
continually
in
order
to
arouse
in
him
the
interest
the
keen
tense
excitement
that
his
jaded
nerves
craved
the
five
hundred
dollars
that
he
had
drawn
from
the
ten
thousand
the
first
payment
on
his
old
home
melted
away
within
a
week
only
a
few
years
ago
vandover
would
have
stopped
to
reflect
upon
the
meaning
of
this
would
have
resisted
the
temptation
that
drew
him
constantly
to
the
but
the
idea
of
resistance
never
so
much
as
occurred
to
him
he
did
not
invest
his
fifteen
thousand
but
drew
upon
it
continually
to
satisfy
his
last
new
craze
it
was
not
with
any
hope
of
winning
that
he
gambled
the
desire
of
money
was
never
strong
in
him
it
was
only
the
love
of
the
excitement
of
the
moment
little
by
little
the
fifteen
thousand
in
the
bank
dwindled
it
did
not
all
go
in
cards
certain
habits
of
extravagance
grew
upon
vandover
the
natural
outcome
of
his
persistent
gambling
the
desire
of
winning
easily
being
balanced
by
the
impulses
to
spend
quickly
he
took
a
certain
hysterical
delight
in
flinging
away
money
with
both
hands
now
it
was
the
chartering
of
a
yacht
for
a
cruise
about
the
bay
or
it
was
a
bicycle
bought
one
week
and
thrown
away
the
next
a
fresh
suit
of
clothes
each
month
gloves
worn
but
once
thrust
into
flossie
pockets
suppers
given
to
bouffe
actresses
acquaintances
a
racehorse
bought
for
eight
hundred
dollars
resold
for
two
hundred
and
fifty
rings
and
given
away
to
the
women
and
girls
of
the
imperial
and
a
whole
world
of
follies
that
his
poor
distorted
wits
conceived
from
hour
to
hour
his
judgment
was
gone
his
mind
unbalanced
all
his
life
vandover
had
been
sinking
slowly
lower
and
lower
this
however
was
the
beginning
of
the
last
plunge
the
process
of
degeneration
though
inevitable
had
been
gradual
as
long
as
he
indulged
generally
in
all
forms
of
evil
it
was
only
now
when
a
passion
for
one
particular
vice
absorbed
him
that
he
commenced
to
rush
headlong
to
his
ruin
the
fifteen
thousand
dollars
the
price
of
his
old
home
he
gambled
or
flung
away
in
a
little
less
than
a
year
he
never
invested
it
but
ate
into
it
day
after
day
sometimes
to
pay
his
gambling
debts
sometimes
to
indulge
an
absurd
and
extravagant
whim
sometimes
to
pay
his
bill
at
the
lick
house
and
sometimes
for
no
reason
at
all
moved
simply
by
a
reckless
desire
for
spending
on
the
evening
of
a
certain
thanksgiving
day
nine
months
after
he
had
sold
the
house
vandover
came
in
through
the
ladies
entrance
of
the
imperial
going
slowly
down
the
passageway
looking
into
the
little
rooms
on
his
right
for
ellis
or
the
dummy
there
had
been
a
great
intercollegiate
football
game
that
day
and
vandover
remembering
that
he
had
once
found
an
interest
in
such
things
had
at
first
determined
to
see
it
but
toward
eleven
in
the
morning
the
rain
had
begun
to
fall
and
ellis
who
was
to
have
gone
with
him
declared
that
he
did
not
care
enough
about
the
game
to
go
out
to
it
in
the
rain
vandover
was
disappointed
he
fancied
that
he
could
have
enjoyed
the
game
as
much
as
he
could
enjoy
anything
of
late
but
he
hated
to
go
to
places
alone
in
the
end
however
he
resolved
to
go
whether
ellis
went
or
not
it
was
a
holiday
vandover
had
ellis
and
the
dummy
to
lunch
with
him
at
the
hotel
where
they
arranged
the
menu
of
a
famous
thanksgiving
dinner
for
that
evening
they
would
meet
in
one
of
the
little
rooms
of
the
imperial
and
go
from
there
to
the
restaurant
as
they
were
finishing
their
lunch
vandover
said
i
got
a
new
kind
of
liqueur
yesterday
has
a
colour
like
violets
and
smells
like
cologne
you
fellows
better
come
up
to
my
room
and
try
it
i
got
to
go
up
and
change
anyway
if
i
go
out
to
that
game
they
all
went
up
to
vandover
cheerless
room
and
ellis
began
to
argue
with
vandover
against
the
folly
of
going
anywhere
in
the
rain
do
want
to
go
to
that
game
van
just
look
how
it
raining
i
bet
there
wo
be
a
thousand
people
there
they
probably
postpone
the
game
anyway
say
this
queer
looking
stuff
what
do
you
call
it
the
dummy
set
down
his
emptied
liqueur
glass
on
the
mantelshelf
and
nodded
approvingly
at
vandover
then
he
scribbled
out
of
sight
on
his
tablet
tastes
like
cough
syrup
and
alcohol
growled
ellis
scowling
and
sipping
i
think
a
pint
of
this
would
make
the
dummy
talk
dutch
keep
it
up
dummy
he
continued
articulating
distinctly
so
that
the
other
could
catch
the
movement
of
his
lips
drink
some
more
make
you
talk
vandover
was
cutting
the
string
around
a
pasteboard
box
that
had
just
come
from
his
tailor
it
was
a
new
suit
of
clothes
rough
cheviot
brown
with
small
checks
he
dressed
slowly
and
tipped
forward
the
swinging
mirror
of
the
bureau
to
see
how
the
trousers
set
meanwhile
ellis
and
the
dummy
had
got
out
the
cards
and
chips
from
the
drawer
of
the
and
had
begun
a
game
better
change
your
mind
van
said
ellis
without
raising
his
eyes
from
the
cards
no
sir
answered
van
you
do
know
how
it
is
you
never
were
a
college
man
why
i
would
miss
a
football
game
for
anything
talk
about
your
talk
about
your
baseball
i
tell
you
nothing
in
the
world
so
exciting
as
a
hot
football
game
he
swung
into
his
long
waterproof
and
stood
behind
ellis
watching
his
game
for
a
moment
while
he
tied
a
couple
of
long
silk
streamers
to
his
umbrella
handle
it
one
of
the
college
colours
he
explained
seems
like
old
times
back
at
harvard
ellis
snorted
with
contempt
such
kids
he
growled
i
saw
one
of
the
coaches
go
down
the
street
a
little
while
ago
continued
vandover
still
watching
ellis
shuffle
and
deal
there
were
about
twenty
college
men
on
top
and
they
had
a
big
bulldog
all
harnessed
out
in
their
colours
and
they
were
blowing
and
i
tell
you
it
made
me
wish
i
was
one
of
them
again
ellis
did
not
answer
it
was
probable
he
did
not
hear
both
he
and
the
dummy
were
settling
down
for
a
game
that
no
doubt
would
last
all
the
afternoon
vandover
made
them
free
of
his
room
and
they
often
gambled
there
when
he
was
away
but
it
invariably
made
ellis
nervous
to
have
any
one
stand
behind
his
chair
while
he
was
playing
he
began
to
move
about
uneasily
by
and
by
he
looked
at
his
watch
better
get
a
move
on
he
said
you
be
late
just
a
minute
answered
vandover
more
and
more
interested
in
the
game
go
on
playing
do
bother
about
me
oh
i
saw
charlie
geary
too
he
continued
on
another
coach
there
was
a
party
of
them
charlie
was
with
turner
ravis
on
the
box
seat
you
remember
turner
ravis
do
you
bandy
the
girl
i
used
to
go
with
there
a
girl
i
never
liked
observed
ellis
she
always
struck
me
as
being
one
of
these
regular
snobs
ah
snob
is
no
name
for
it
assented
vandover
she
thought
she
was
too
damned
for
me
as
soon
as
i
got
into
that
mess
about
ida
wade
she
threw
me
over
no
she
did
want
to
be
associated
with
me
any
longer
well
she
can
go
to
the
devil
geary
welcome
to
her
i
thought
dolly
haight
was
going
to
marry
her
said
ellis
what
was
the
matter
i
do
know
returned
vandover
probably
dolly
haight
did
have
enough
money
to
suit
her
guess
she
wants
a
man
that
will
make
his
pile
in
this
town
and
make
his
way
too
ah
you
bet
half
an
hour
later
he
was
still
behind
ellis
chair
ellis
had
become
so
fidgety
that
he
was
losing
steadily
once
more
he
turned
to
vandover
speaking
over
his
shoulder
come
on
come
on
van
go
along
to
your
football
you
make
me
nervous
standing
there
vandover
pushed
a
across
the
table
to
the
dummy
who
was
banking
and
said
give
me
that
in
chips
i
coming
in
i
thought
you
were
going
to
the
game
inquired
ellis
ah
the
devil
answered
vandover
too
much
rain
they
had
played
without
interruption
all
that
afternoon
and
for
once
vandover
had
all
the
luck
when
they
broke
up
about
five
with
the
understanding
to
meet
again
in
the
imperial
at
seven
he
had
won
nearly
a
hundred
dollars
when
vandover
went
out
to
keep
this
appointment
he
found
the
streets
especially
kearney
and
market
streets
crowded
it
was
about
six
the
football
game
was
over
and
the
college
men
had
returned
they
were
everywhere
marching
about
in
long
files
fashion
each
file
headed
by
a
man
beating
upon
a
gong
or
parading
the
sidewalks
ten
abreast
singing
college
songs
or
shouting
their
slogan
at
every
moment
one
heard
the
college
yells
answering
each
other
from
street
corner
to
street
corner
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
vandover
found
the
imperial
crowded
with
students
the
barroom
was
packed
to
the
doors
every
one
of
the
little
rooms
in
the
front
hall
was
full
while
flossie
and
nannie
had
a
great
party
of
the
young
fellows
in
one
of
the
larger
rooms
in
the
rear
among
the
crowd
in
the
barroom
three
members
of
the
winning
team
heroes
with
bandages
about
their
heads
were
breaking
training
smoking
and
drinking
for
the
first
time
in
many
long
weeks
vandover
found
ellis
and
the
dummy
leaning
against
the
wall
in
the
crowded
front
passage
they
were
both
in
bad
humour
the
dummy
sulking
because
flossie
had
left
him
for
one
of
the
football
men
the
a
young
blond
giant
with
two
dislocated
fingers
ellis
in
a
rage
because
he
could
get
no
cocktails
at
the
bar
only
straight
drinks
that
night
too
much
of
a
crowd
these
damn
college
sports
thought
they
owned
the
town
ah
let
get
out
of
here
van
he
called
over
the
heads
of
the
throng
as
soon
as
vandover
came
in
sight
they
went
out
into
the
street
and
started
in
the
direction
of
the
restaurant
where
they
had
decided
to
eat
their
thanksgiving
dinner
after
leaving
vandover
that
afternoon
ellis
had
seen
the
head
waiter
of
this
restaurant
and
had
explained
to
him
the
bill
of
fare
that
vandover
the
dummy
and
himself
had
arranged
during
their
lunch
at
the
lick
house
the
streets
had
relapsed
into
a
momentary
quiet
it
was
between
six
and
seven
and
most
of
the
college
men
were
gathered
into
the
hotels
and
cafés
eating
dinner
about
an
hour
later
they
would
reappear
again
for
a
moment
on
their
way
to
the
theatre
which
they
were
to
attend
in
a
body
but
vandover
suddenly
discovered
that
he
could
not
eat
a
mouthful
the
smell
of
food
revolted
him
and
little
by
little
an
irregular
twitching
had
overcome
his
hands
and
forearms
he
had
received
a
great
shock
that
same
evening
as
he
was
leaving
the
hotel
the
clerk
at
the
office
had
handed
him
some
letters
that
had
accumulated
in
his
box
vandover
could
never
think
to
ask
for
his
mail
in
the
morning
as
he
went
in
to
breakfast
something
was
surely
wrong
with
his
head
of
late
every
day
he
found
it
harder
and
harder
to
remember
things
there
were
three
letters
altogether
one
was
the
tailor
bill
mailed
the
same
day
that
his
last
suit
had
been
finished
a
second
was
an
advertisement
announcing
the
near
opening
of
the
sutro
baths
that
were
building
at
that
time
and
the
third
a
notice
from
the
bank
calling
his
attention
to
the
fact
that
his
account
was
overdrawn
by
some
sixty
dollars
at
first
vandover
did
not
see
the
meaning
of
this
notice
and
thrust
it
back
in
his
pocket
together
with
the
tailor
bill
then
slowly
an
idea
struggled
into
his
mind
was
it
possible
that
he
no
longer
had
any
money
at
the
bank
was
his
fifteen
thousand
gone
from
time
to
time
his
had
been
balanced
and
invariably
during
the
first
days
of
each
month
his
checks
had
come
back
to
him
used
and
crumpled
covered
with
strange
signatures
and
stamped
in
blue
ink
but
after
the
first
few
months
he
had
never
paid
the
least
attention
to
these
he
never
kept
accounts
having
a
veritable
feminine
horror
of
figures
but
it
was
absurd
to
think
that
his
money
was
gone
pshaw
one
could
not
spend
fifteen
thousand
in
nine
months
it
was
preposterous
this
notice
was
some
technicality
that
he
could
not
understand
he
would
look
into
it
the
next
day
and
so
he
dismissed
the
wearisome
matter
from
his
mind
with
a
shrug
of
his
shoulders
as
though
ridding
himself
of
some
troublesome
burden
however
the
idea
persisted
somehow
between
the
lines
of
the
printed
form
he
smelt
out
a
fresh
disaster
he
read
it
over
again
and
again
all
at
once
as
he
stood
in
the
doorway
of
the
hotel
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
waterproof
and
watching
the
little
pools
in
the
hollows
of
the
asphalt
pavement
to
see
if
it
were
still
raining
the
conviction
came
upon
him
in
a
second
he
knew
that
he
was
ruined
the
true
meaning
of
the
notice
became
apparent
with
the
swiftness
of
a
great
flash
of
light
he
had
spent
his
fifteen
thousand
dollars
the
blow
was
strong
enough
sudden
enough
to
penetrate
even
clouded
and
distorted
wits
his
nerves
were
gone
in
a
minute
a
sudden
stupefying
numbness
fell
upon
his
brain
and
the
fear
of
something
unknown
the
immense
unreasoning
terror
that
had
gripped
him
for
the
first
time
the
morning
after
ida
wade
suicide
came
back
upon
him
horrible
crushing
so
that
he
had
to
shut
his
teeth
against
a
wild
hysterical
desire
to
rush
through
the
streets
screaming
and
waving
his
arms
by
the
time
the
three
friends
had
reached
the
restaurant
where
they
were
to
eat
their
thanksgiving
dinner
vandover
appetite
had
given
place
to
a
loathing
of
the
very
smell
of
food
his
nervousness
was
fast
approaching
hysteria
the
little
nerve
clusters
all
over
his
body
seemed
to
be
crisping
and
writhing
like
balls
of
tiny
serpents
at
intervals
he
would
twitch
sharply
as
though
startled
at
some
sudden
noise
his
breath
coming
short
his
heart
beating
quick
they
had
their
dinner
in
one
of
the
private
rooms
of
the
restaurant
on
the
second
floor
all
through
the
meal
vandover
struggled
to
keep
himself
in
hand
fighting
with
all
his
strength
against
this
reappearance
of
his
old
enemy
this
sudden
return
of
the
dreadful
crisis
determined
not
to
make
an
exhibition
of
himself
before
the
others
he
pretended
to
eat
and
forced
himself
to
talk
joining
in
with
ellis
who
was
badgering
the
dummy
about
flossie
the
proper
thing
to
do
was
to
fill
the
dummy
glass
while
his
attention
was
otherwise
absorbed
and
in
the
end
to
get
him
so
drunk
that
he
could
talk
toward
the
end
of
the
dinner
ellis
was
successful
all
at
once
the
dummy
got
upon
his
feet
his
eyes
were
glazed
with
drunkenness
he
swayed
about
in
an
irregular
circle
holding
up
now
by
the
table
now
by
the
and
now
by
the
wall
behind
him
he
was
very
angry
exasperated
beyond
control
by
ellis
raillery
and
abuse
he
forgot
himself
and
uttered
a
series
of
peculiar
cries
very
faint
and
shrill
like
the
sounds
of
a
voice
heard
through
a
telephone
when
some
imperfection
of
transmission
prevents
one
from
distinguishing
the
words
his
mouth
was
wide
open
and
his
tongue
rolled
about
in
an
absurd
way
between
his
teeth
now
and
then
one
could
catch
a
word
or
two
ellis
went
into
spasms
of
laughter
holding
his
sides
gasping
for
breath
vandover
could
not
help
being
amused
and
the
two
laughed
at
the
stammering
rage
until
their
breath
was
spent
throughout
the
rest
of
the
evening
the
dummy
recommenced
from
time
to
time
rising
unsteadily
to
his
feet
shaking
his
fists
pouring
out
a
stream
of
little
ineffectual
birdlike
twitterings
trying
to
give
ellis
abuse
for
abuse
trying
to
talk
long
after
it
had
ceased
to
amuse
the
other
two
ellis
had
been
drinking
for
nearly
six
hours
without
the
liquor
producing
the
slightest
effect
upon
him
long
since
the
dummy
was
hopelessly
drunk
and
now
vandover
who
had
been
drinking
upon
an
empty
stomach
began
to
grow
very
noisy
and
boisterous
little
by
little
ellis
himself
commenced
to
lose
his
by
and
by
he
and
vandover
began
to
sing
each
independent
of
the
other
very
hoarse
and
loud
the
dummy
joined
them
making
a
hideous
and
lamentable
noise
which
so
affected
ellis
that
he
pretended
to
howl
at
it
like
a
little
dog
overcome
by
mournful
music
but
suddenly
ellis
had
an
idea
crying
out
thickly
between
two
hiccoughs
hey
there
van
do
your
for
us
go
on
bark
for
us
by
this
time
vandover
was
very
nearly
out
of
his
head
his
drunkenness
finishing
what
his
nervousness
had
begun
the
attack
was
fast
approaching
culmination
strange
and
unnatural
fancies
began
to
come
and
go
in
his
brain
go
on
van
urged
ellis
his
eyes
heavy
with
alcohol
go
on
do
your
all
at
once
it
was
as
though
an
angry
dog
were
snarling
and
barking
over
a
bone
there
under
the
table
about
their
feet
ellis
roared
with
laughter
but
suddenly
he
himself
was
drunk
all
the
afternoon
he
had
kept
himself
in
hand
now
his
intoxication
came
upon
him
in
a
moment
the
skin
around
his
eyes
was
purple
and
swollen
the
pupils
themselves
were
contracted
they
grew
darker
taking
on
the
colour
of
bitumen
suddenly
he
swept
glasses
plates
castor
knives
forks
and
all
from
off
the
table
with
a
single
movement
of
his
arm
then
the
alcohol
overcame
him
all
in
an
instant
like
a
poisonous
gas
he
swayed
forward
in
his
chair
and
fell
across
the
stripped
table
his
head
rolling
inertly
between
his
outstretched
arms
he
did
not
move
again
in
a
neighbouring
room
young
haight
had
been
dining
with
some
college
fellows
fraternity
men
all
friends
of
his
upon
whose
coach
he
had
ridden
to
and
from
the
game
he
had
heard
vandover
and
ellis
in
the
room
across
the
hall
and
had
recognized
their
voices
haight
had
never
been
a
friend
of
ellis
but
no
one
not
even
turner
had
grieved
more
over
vandover
ruin
than
had
his
college
chum
young
haight
heard
the
noise
of
the
falling
crockery
as
ellis
swept
the
table
clear
and
turned
his
head
sharply
listening
there
was
a
moment
silence
after
this
and
haight
fearing
some
accident
had
happened
stepped
out
into
the
hall
and
stood
there
a
moment
listening
again
his
head
inclined
toward
the
closed
door
he
heard
no
groaning
no
exclamations
of
pain
not
even
any
noise
of
conversation
only
through
the
closed
door
came
a
steady
sound
of
barking
puzzled
he
tried
the
door
and
finding
it
locked
as
he
had
expected
put
one
foot
upon
the
knob
and
catching
hold
of
the
top
jamb
raised
himself
up
and
looked
down
through
the
open
space
that
answered
for
a
transom
the
room
was
very
warm
the
air
thick
with
the
smell
of
cooked
food
the
fumes
of
whisky
and
the
acrid
odour
of
cigar
smoke
ellis
had
rolled
from
his
chair
and
lay
upon
the
floor
sprawling
on
his
face
in
the
wreck
of
the
table
near
to
him
likewise
upon
the
floor
but
sitting
up
his
back
against
the
wall
was
the
dummy
he
was
muttering
incessantly
to
himself
as
if
delighted
at
having
found
his
tongue
his
head
swaying
on
his
shoulders
and
a
strange
murmur
soft
birdlike
meaningless
like
sounds
heard
from
a
vast
distance
coming
from
his
mouth
vandover
was
sitting
bolt
upright
in
his
chair
his
hands
gripping
the
table
his
eyes
staring
straight
before
him
he
was
barking
incessantly
it
was
evident
that
now
he
could
not
stop
himself
it
was
like
hysterical
laughter
a
thing
beyond
his
control
twice
young
haight
called
him
by
name
kicking
the
door
as
his
leg
hung
against
it
at
last
vandover
heard
him
then
as
he
caught
sight
of
his
face
over
the
door
he
raised
his
upper
lip
above
his
teeth
and
snarled
at
him
long
and
viciously
as
haight
dropped
down
into
the
hall
a
waiter
came
running
up
he
too
had
heard
the
noise
of
the
breaking
dishes
as
he
thrust
his
key
into
the
lock
he
paused
a
moment
listening
and
looking
in
a
puzzled
way
at
young
haight
they
have
a
dog
in
here
then
they
had
no
dog
when
they
came
that
funny
open
the
door
said
young
haight
quietly
once
inside
haight
went
directly
to
vandover
crying
out
come
come
on
van
come
home
with
me
vandover
started
suddenly
looking
about
him
bewildered
drawing
his
hand
across
his
face
home
he
repeated
vaguely
yes
that
the
idea
let
go
home
i
want
to
go
to
bed
hello
dolly
where
did
come
from
say
dolly
let
me
tell
you
listen
here
come
down
here
close
you
must
mind
me
you
know
i
a
wolf
mostly
they
went
down
toward
the
lick
house
vandover
grew
steadier
after
a
few
minutes
in
the
open
air
young
haight
locked
arms
with
him
they
went
on
together
in
silence
by
this
time
the
streets
were
crowded
again
the
theatres
were
over
and
the
college
men
were
once
more
at
large
now
they
were
all
gathered
together
into
one
immense
procession
headed
by
a
brass
band
in
a
brewer
wagon
and
they
tramped
aimlessly
to
and
fro
about
kearney
and
market
streets
making
a
hideous
noise
at
the
head
the
band
was
playing
a
popular
with
a
great
banging
of
a
bass
drum
the
college
men
in
the
front
ranks
were
singing
one
song
those
in
the
rear
another
while
the
middle
of
the
column
was
given
over
to
an
abominable
medley
of
policemen
rattles
and
great
chinese
gongs
at
stated
intervals
the
throng
would
halt
and
give
the
college
yell
dolly
you
and
i
used
to
do
that
said
vandover
looking
after
the
procession
he
had
himself
well
in
hand
by
this
time
what
was
the
matter
with
me
back
there
at
the
restaurant
dolly
he
asked
after
a
while
oh
you
been
drinking
a
good
deal
i
guess
answered
young
haight
you
you
had
some
queer
idea
about
yourself
yes
i
know
answered
vandover
quickly
fancied
i
was
some
kind
of
a
beast
did
i
some
kind
of
wolf
i
have
that
notion
sometimes
and
i
ca
get
it
out
of
my
head
it
curious
just
the
same
they
went
up
to
vandover
room
vandover
lit
the
gas
but
he
could
hardly
keep
back
an
exclamation
as
the
glare
suddenly
struck
young
haight
face
what
in
heaven
name
was
the
matter
with
his
chum
he
seemed
to
be
blighted
shattered
struck
down
by
some
terrible
overwhelming
calamity
a
dreadful
anguish
looked
through
his
eyes
the
sense
of
a
hopeless
misery
had
drawn
and
twisted
his
face
there
could
be
no
doubt
that
something
had
made
shipwreck
of
his
life
vandover
was
looking
at
a
ruined
man
my
god
dolly
exclaimed
vandover
what
happened
to
you
you
look
like
a
man
what
gone
wrong
are
you
well
haight
caught
his
friend
searching
gaze
and
for
a
moment
they
looked
at
each
other
without
speaking
there
was
no
mistaking
the
fearful
grief
that
smouldered
behind
haight
dull
listless
eyes
for
a
moment
vandover
thought
of
turner
ravis
but
even
if
she
had
turned
him
off
that
alone
would
not
account
for
his
friend
fearful
condition
of
mind
and
body
what
is
it
dolly
persisted
vandover
we
used
to
be
pretty
good
chums
not
so
long
ago
they
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
and
for
a
moment
their
positions
seemed
reversed
haight
the
one
to
be
protected
and
consoled
vandover
the
shielding
and
one
young
haight
passed
his
hand
over
his
face
before
he
answered
and
vandover
noticed
that
his
fingers
trembled
like
an
old
man
do
you
remember
that
night
van
when
you
and
charlie
and
i
all
went
out
to
turner
house
and
we
had
and
beer
and
a
glass
broke
in
that
peculiar
way
and
i
cut
my
lip
vandover
nodded
forcing
his
attention
against
the
alcoholic
fumes
to
follow
his
friend
words
we
went
down
to
the
imperial
afterward
haight
continued
and
ran
into
ellis
and
we
had
something
more
to
eat
do
you
remember
that
as
we
sat
there
toby
the
waiter
brought
flossie
in
and
she
sat
there
with
us
a
while
he
paused
choosing
his
words
vandover
listened
closely
trying
to
recall
the
incident
she
kissed
me
said
young
haight
slowly
and
the
came
off
you
know
i
never
had
anything
to
do
with
women
van
i
always
tried
to
keep
away
from
them
but
that
where
my
life
practically
came
to
an
end
you
mean
began
vandover
you
mean
that
you
that
flossie
haight
nodded
good
god
i
ca
believe
it
it
not
possible
i
flossie
haight
shook
his
head
smiling
grimly
i
ca
help
that
van
said
he
there
no
denying
facts
there
no
other
possible
explanation
as
soon
as
i
knew
i
went
to
the
doctors
here
and
then
i
went
to
new
york
for
treatment
but
there
no
hope
i
did
know
you
see
i
did
believe
it
possible
turner
ravis
and
i
were
engaged
i
waited
too
long
there
only
one
escape
for
me
now
his
voice
dropped
he
stared
for
a
moment
at
the
floor
then
he
straightened
up
and
said
in
a
different
tone
but
damn
it
van
not
talk
about
it
i
haunted
with
the
thing
day
and
night
i
want
to
talk
to
you
i
want
to
talk
to
you
seriously
you
know
you
are
ruining
yourself
old
man
but
vandover
interrupted
him
with
a
gesture
saying
do
go
on
dolly
it
is
the
least
use
there
a
time
for
that
but
that
was
long
ago
i
used
to
care
i
used
to
be
sorry
and
all
that
but
i
not
now
ruining
myself
why
i
ruined
myself
long
ago
we
both
ruined
only
in
your
case
it
was
your
fault
it
too
late
for
me
now
and
i
even
not
sorry
that
it
too
late
dolly
i
do
to
pull
up
you
ca
imagine
a
man
fallen
as
low
as
that
can
you
i
could
imagine
it
myself
a
few
years
ago
i
going
right
straight
to
the
devil
now
and
you
might
as
well
stand
aside
and
give
me
a
free
course
for
i
bound
to
get
there
sooner
or
later
i
suppose
you
would
think
that
a
man
who
could
see
this
as
plainly
as
i
do
would
be
afraid
would
have
remorse
and
all
that
sort
of
thing
well
i
did
at
first
i
never
forget
the
night
when
i
first
saw
it
came
near
shooting
myself
but
i
got
over
it
and
now
i
used
to
the
idea
dolly
can
get
used
to
almost
nothing
makes
much
difference
to
me
nowadays
only
i
like
to
play
cards
look
here
he
went
on
laying
out
the
notice
from
the
bank
upon
the
table
this
came
you
see
what
it
is
i
sold
the
old
house
on
california
street
well
i
gambled
away
that
money
in
less
than
a
year
it
seems
that
i
a
financial
ruin
now
but
and
he
began
to
laugh
i
live
through
it
somehow
the
news
did
prevent
me
from
getting
drunk
after
young
haight
was
gone
vandover
went
to
bed
turning
out
the
gas
and
drawing
down
the
window
from
the
top
the
wine
had
made
him
sleepy
he
was
dropping
away
into
a
very
grateful
doze
when
a
sudden
shock
a
violent
leap
of
every
nerve
in
his
body
brought
him
up
to
a
sitting
posture
gasping
for
breath
his
heart
fluttering
his
hands
beating
at
the
empty
air
he
settled
down
again
turning
upon
his
pillow
closing
his
eyes
very
weary
longing
for
a
good
night
sleep
dolly
haight
terrible
story
his
unjustified
fate
and
the
hopeless
tragedy
of
it
came
back
to
him
vandover
would
gladly
have
changed
places
with
him
young
haight
had
the
affection
and
respect
of
even
those
that
knew
he
vandover
had
thrown
away
his
friends
love
and
their
esteem
with
the
rest
of
the
things
he
had
once
valued
his
thoughts
released
from
all
control
of
his
will
began
to
come
and
go
through
his
head
with
incredible
rapidity
confused
ideas
scenes
incidents
of
the
past
few
days
bits
and
ends
of
conversation
recalled
for
no
especial
reason
all
galloping
across
his
brain
like
a
long
herd
of
terrified
horses
an
excitement
grew
upon
him
a
strange
thrill
of
exhilaration
he
was
broad
awake
now
but
suddenly
his
left
leg
his
left
arm
and
wrist
all
his
left
side
jerked
with
the
suddenness
of
a
sprung
trap
so
violent
was
the
shock
that
the
entire
bed
shook
and
creaked
with
it
then
the
inevitable
reaction
followed
the
slow
crisping
and
torsion
of
his
nerves
twisting
upon
each
other
like
a
vast
swarm
of
tiny
serpents
it
seemed
to
begin
with
his
ankles
spreading
slowly
to
every
part
of
his
body
it
was
a
veritable
torture
so
poignant
that
vandover
groaned
under
it
shutting
his
eyes
he
could
not
keep
quiet
a
second
to
lie
in
bed
was
an
impossibility
he
threw
the
from
him
and
sprang
up
he
did
not
light
the
gas
but
threw
on
his
bathrobe
and
began
to
walk
the
floor
even
as
he
walked
his
eyelids
drooped
lower
and
lower
the
need
of
sleep
overcame
him
like
a
narcotic
but
as
soon
as
he
was
about
to
lose
himself
he
would
be
suddenly
and
violently
awakened
by
the
same
shock
the
same
jangling
recoil
of
his
nerves
then
his
hands
and
head
seemed
to
swell
next
it
was
as
though
the
whole
room
was
too
small
for
him
he
threw
open
the
window
and
leaning
upon
his
elbows
looked
out
the
clouds
had
begun
to
break
the
rain
was
gradually
ceasing
leaving
in
the
air
a
damp
fresh
smell
the
smell
of
wet
asphalt
and
the
odour
of
dripping
woodwork
it
was
warm
the
atmosphere
was
dank
heavy
tepid
one
or
two
stars
were
out
and
a
faint
gray
light
showed
him
the
vast
reach
of
roofs
below
stretching
away
to
meet
the
abrupt
rise
of
telegraph
hill
not
far
off
the
slender
graceful
smokestack
puffed
steadily
throwing
off
continually
the
little
flock
of
white
jets
that
rose
into
the
air
very
brave
and
gay
but
in
the
end
dwindled
irresolutely
discouraged
disheartened
fading
sadly
away
vanishing
under
the
night
like
illusions
disappearing
at
the
first
touch
of
the
outside
world
as
vandover
leaned
from
his
window
looking
out
into
the
night
with
eyes
that
saw
nothing
the
college
slogan
rose
again
from
the
great
crowd
of
students
who
still
continued
to
hold
the
streets
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
he
turned
back
into
the
room
groping
among
the
bottles
on
his
washstand
for
his
bromide
of
potassium
as
he
poured
out
the
required
dose
into
the
teaspoon
his
hand
twitched
again
sharply
flirting
the
medicine
over
his
bared
neck
and
chest
exposed
by
the
bathrobe
which
he
had
left
open
at
the
throat
it
was
cold
and
he
shivered
a
bit
as
he
wiped
it
dry
with
the
back
of
his
hand
he
knew
very
well
that
his
nervous
attack
was
coming
on
again
as
he
set
down
the
bottle
upon
the
washstand
he
muttered
to
himself
now
going
to
have
a
night
of
it
he
began
to
walk
the
floor
again
with
great
strides
fighting
with
all
his
pitiful
shattered
mind
against
the
increasing
hysteria
trying
to
keep
out
of
his
brain
the
strange
hallucination
that
assailed
it
from
time
to
time
the
hallucination
of
a
thing
a
thing
that
sulked
and
snarled
the
hotel
grew
quiet
a
watchman
went
down
the
hall
turning
out
each
alternate
gas
jet
just
outside
of
the
door
was
a
burner
in
a
red
globe
fixed
at
a
stair
landing
to
show
the
exit
in
case
of
fire
this
burned
all
night
and
it
streamed
through
the
transom
of
vandover
room
splotching
the
ceiling
with
a
great
square
of
red
light
vandover
was
in
a
torment
overcome
now
by
that
same
fear
with
which
he
had
at
last
become
so
familiar
the
unreasoning
terror
of
something
unknown
he
uttered
an
exclamation
a
suppressed
cry
of
despair
of
misery
and
then
suddenly
checked
himself
astonished
seized
with
the
fancy
that
his
cry
was
not
human
was
not
of
himself
but
of
something
the
snarl
of
some
exasperated
brute
he
paused
abruptly
in
his
walk
listening
for
what
he
did
not
know
the
silence
of
the
great
city
spread
itself
around
him
like
the
still
waters
of
some
vast
lagoon
through
the
silence
he
heard
the
noise
of
the
throng
of
college
youths
they
were
returning
doubling
upon
their
line
of
march
a
long
puff
of
tepid
air
breathing
through
the
open
window
brought
to
his
ears
the
distant
joyous
sound
of
their
slogan
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
they
passed
by
along
the
adjacent
street
their
sounds
growing
faint
vandover
took
up
his
restless
pacing
again
little
by
little
the
hallucination
gained
upon
him
little
by
little
his
mind
slipped
from
his
grasp
the
wolf
the
beast
whatever
the
creature
was
seemed
in
his
diseased
fancy
to
grow
stronger
in
him
from
moment
to
moment
but
with
all
his
strength
he
fought
against
it
fought
against
this
strange
mania
that
overcame
him
at
these
periodical
intervals
fought
with
his
hands
so
tightly
clenched
that
the
knuckles
grew
white
that
the
nails
bit
into
the
palm
it
seemed
to
him
that
in
some
way
his
personality
divided
itself
into
three
there
was
himself
the
real
vandover
of
every
day
the
same
familiar
vandover
that
looked
back
at
him
from
his
mirror
then
there
was
the
wolf
the
beast
whatever
the
creature
was
that
lived
in
his
flesh
and
that
struggled
with
him
now
striving
to
gain
the
ascendency
to
absorb
the
real
vandover
into
its
own
hideous
identity
and
last
of
all
there
was
a
third
self
formless
very
vague
elusive
that
stood
aside
and
watched
the
strife
of
the
other
two
but
as
he
fought
against
his
madness
concentrating
all
his
attention
with
a
tremendous
effort
of
the
will
the
queer
numbness
that
came
upon
his
mind
whenever
he
exerted
it
enwrapped
his
brain
like
a
fog
and
this
third
self
grew
vaguer
than
ever
dwindled
and
disappeared
somehow
it
seemed
to
be
associated
with
consciousness
for
after
this
the
sense
of
the
reality
of
things
grew
dim
and
blurred
to
him
he
ceased
to
know
exactly
what
he
was
doing
his
intellectual
parts
dropped
away
one
by
one
leaving
only
the
instincts
the
blind
unreasoning
impulses
of
the
animal
still
he
continued
his
restless
lurching
walk
back
and
forth
in
his
room
his
head
hanging
low
and
swinging
from
side
to
side
with
the
movement
of
his
gait
he
had
become
so
nervous
that
the
restraint
imposed
upon
his
freedom
of
movement
by
his
bathrobe
and
his
loose
chafed
and
irritated
him
at
length
he
had
stripped
off
everything
suddenly
and
without
the
slightest
warning
vandover
hands
came
slowly
above
his
head
and
he
dropped
forward
landing
upon
his
palms
all
in
an
instant
he
had
given
way
yielding
in
a
second
to
the
strange
hallucination
of
that
thing
that
sulked
and
snarled
now
without
a
moment
stop
he
ran
back
and
forth
along
the
wall
of
the
room
upon
the
palms
of
his
hands
and
his
toes
a
ludicrous
figure
like
that
of
certain
clowns
one
sees
at
the
circus
contortionists
walking
about
the
sawdust
imitating
some
kind
of
enormous
dog
still
he
swung
his
head
from
side
to
side
with
the
motion
of
his
shuffling
gait
his
eyes
dull
and
fixed
at
long
intervals
he
uttered
a
sound
half
word
half
cry
wolf
wolf
but
it
was
muffled
indistinct
raucous
coming
more
from
his
throat
than
from
his
lips
it
might
easily
have
been
the
growl
of
an
animal
a
long
time
passed
naked
vandover
ran
back
and
forth
the
length
of
the
room
by
an
hour
after
midnight
the
sky
was
clear
all
the
stars
were
out
the
moon
a
thin
scimitar
set
behind
the
black
mass
of
the
roofs
of
the
city
leaving
a
pale
bluish
light
that
seemed
to
come
from
all
quarters
of
the
horizon
as
the
great
stillness
grew
more
and
more
complete
the
persistent
puffing
of
the
slender
tin
stack
the
three
gay
and
joyous
little
noises
each
sounding
like
a
note
of
discreet
laughter
interrupted
by
a
cough
became
clear
and
distinct
inside
the
room
there
was
no
sound
except
the
persistent
patter
of
something
going
up
and
down
at
length
even
this
sound
ceased
abruptly
worn
out
vandover
had
just
fallen
dropping
forward
upon
his
face
with
a
long
breath
he
lay
still
sleeping
at
last
the
remnant
of
the
great
band
of
college
men
went
down
an
adjacent
street
raising
their
cadenced
slogan
for
the
last
time
it
came
through
the
open
window
softened
as
it
were
by
the
warm
air
thick
with
damp
through
which
it
travelled
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
rah
naked
exhausted
vandover
slept
profoundly
stretched
at
full
length
at
the
foot
of
the
bare
white
wall
of
the
room
beneath
two
of
the
little
placards
scrawled
with
ink
that
read
stove
here
mona
lisa
here
chapter
seventeen
on
a
certain
saturday
morning
two
years
later
vandover
awoke
in
his
room
at
the
reno
house
the
room
he
had
now
occupied
for
fifteen
months
one
might
almost
say
that
he
had
been
expelled
from
the
lick
house
for
a
time
he
had
tried
to
retain
his
room
there
with
the
idea
of
paying
his
bills
by
the
money
he
should
win
at
gambling
but
his
bad
luck
was
now
become
a
settled
thing
almost
invariably
he
lost
at
last
ellis
and
the
dummy
had
refused
to
play
with
him
since
he
was
never
able
to
pay
them
when
they
won
they
had
had
a
great
quarrel
ellis
broke
with
him
sullenly
growling
wrathfully
under
his
heavy
moustache
and
the
dummy
had
written
upon
his
pad
so
hastily
and
angrily
that
the
words
could
hardly
be
read
that
he
would
not
play
with
professional
gamblers
men
who
supported
themselves
by
their
winnings
damn
it
one
had
to
be
a
gentleman
next
vandover
had
tried
to
borrow
some
money
of
charlie
geary
geary
had
told
him
that
he
could
not
afford
as
much
as
vandover
needed
then
vandover
became
enraged
he
had
long
since
seen
that
geary
had
practically
swindled
him
out
of
his
block
in
the
mission
and
at
that
very
moment
the
huge
boot
and
shoe
concern
was
completing
the
factory
built
upon
the
ground
that
vandover
had
once
owned
geary
had
cleared
seven
thousand
dollars
on
his
deal
his
refusal
to
loan
his
friend
fifty
dollars
upon
this
occasion
had
exasperated
vandover
out
of
all
bounds
there
was
a
scene
vandover
told
geary
what
he
thought
of
his
deal
in
very
plain
words
they
shouted
swindler
and
gambler
into
each
other
faces
the
whole
office
was
aroused
vandover
was
ejected
by
force
on
a
stair
landing
to
the
street
he
sat
down
and
cried
into
his
arms
folded
upon
his
knees
when
he
returned
to
his
room
he
had
a
sudden
return
of
his
dreadful
nervous
malady
and
barked
and
whined
under
the
bed
then
vandover
wrote
a
check
on
the
bank
the
same
bank
that
had
just
notified
him
that
he
was
overdrawn
and
passed
it
upon
young
haight
how
he
came
to
do
the
thing
he
could
not
tell
it
might
have
been
the
influence
of
geary
successful
robbery
or
it
might
have
been
that
he
had
at
last
lost
all
principle
all
sense
of
honour
and
integrity
at
any
rate
he
could
not
bring
himself
to
feel
very
sorry
he
knew
that
young
haight
would
not
prosecute
him
for
the
dishonesty
he
traded
upon
haight
magnanimity
he
only
felt
glad
that
he
had
the
fifty
dollars
but
by
this
time
vandover
did
not
even
wonder
at
his
own
baseness
and
degradation
a
few
years
ago
this
would
have
been
the
case
now
his
character
was
so
changed
that
the
theft
seemed
somehow
consistent
he
had
destroyed
young
haight
friendship
for
him
he
had
cast
from
him
his
college
chum
his
best
friend
but
neither
did
this
affect
him
nothing
made
much
difference
to
him
now
nevertheless
vandover
was
evicted
from
the
lick
house
three
days
after
he
had
stolen
young
haight
money
instead
of
paying
his
bills
with
the
amount
he
gambled
it
away
in
a
back
room
of
a
new
café
on
market
street
with
toby
the
waiter
from
the
imperial
and
a
certain
german
professor
a
billiard
marker
who
wore
a
waistcoat
figured
with
little
designs
of
the
eiffel
tower
and
who
was
a
third
owner
in
a
trotting
mare
named
tomato
ketchup
vandover
was
now
left
with
only
his
bonds
his
per
cents
these
brought
him
in
but
dollars
a
quarter
or
as
he
had
had
it
arranged
dollars
a
month
just
at
this
time
as
if
by
a
miracle
a
veritable
god
from
the
machine
vandover
lawyer
field
found
him
an
opportunity
to
earn
some
money
for
the
first
and
only
time
in
his
life
vandover
knew
what
it
was
to
work
for
a
living
the
work
that
field
secured
for
him
was
the
work
of
painting
those
little
pictures
on
the
lacquered
surface
of
iron
safes
those
little
oval
landscapes
between
the
lines
of
red
and
gold
lettering
landscapes
rugged
gorges
ocean
steamships
under
all
sail
mountain
lakes
with
sailboats
careening
upon
their
surfaces
the
boat
indicated
by
two
little
triangular
dabs
of
chinese
white
one
for
the
sail
itself
and
the
other
for
its
reflection
in
the
water
sometimes
even
he
was
called
upon
to
paint
other
little
pictures
upon
the
sides
of
big
express
wagons
two
horses
one
white
and
the
other
bay
galloping
very
free
in
an
open
field
their
manes
and
tails
flying
or
a
bulldog
very
savage
sitting
upon
a
green
and
black
safe
or
the
head
of
a
mastiff
with
a
spiked
collar
about
his
neck
what
with
the
pay
for
this
sort
of
work
and
the
interest
of
his
bonds
vandover
managed
to
lead
a
haphazard
sort
of
life
living
about
in
cheap
and
cheap
restaurants
but
he
was
never
more
than
a
workman
and
he
was
so
irregular
that
he
could
never
be
depended
upon
the
moment
he
began
to
paint
again
even
to
paint
such
pitiful
little
pictures
as
these
the
same
familiar
experience
repeated
itself
the
unwillingness
of
his
fingers
their
failure
to
rightly
interpret
his
ideas
the
resulting
crudity
of
his
work
the
sudden
numbness
in
his
brain
the
queer
tense
sensation
behind
his
eyes
but
vandover
had
long
since
become
accustomed
to
these
symptoms
and
would
not
have
minded
them
at
this
time
had
it
not
been
that
they
were
occasionally
followed
by
a
nervous
twitching
and
jerking
of
his
whole
arm
so
that
sometimes
he
could
not
hold
the
brush
steady
a
minute
at
a
time
for
two
years
he
had
drifted
about
the
city
living
now
here
and
now
there
a
real
existence
sinking
a
little
lower
each
day
now
no
one
knew
him
he
had
completely
passed
out
of
the
lives
of
haight
geary
and
ellis
just
as
before
he
had
passed
out
of
the
life
of
turner
ravis
at
the
end
of
the
first
year
they
had
ceased
even
to
think
about
him
for
a
long
time
they
thought
that
he
was
dead
until
one
day
ellis
declared
that
he
had
seen
him
far
down
on
kearney
street
near
the
barbary
coast
looking
at
the
pictures
in
the
illustrated
weeklies
that
were
tacked
upon
the
on
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
a
stationer
ellis
had
told
the
others
that
on
this
occasion
vandover
seemed
to
be
more
sickly
than
ever
he
described
his
appearance
in
detail
wagging
his
head
at
his
own
story
pursing
his
lips
putting
his
chin
in
the
air
vandover
had
worn
an
old
pair
of
blue
trousers
fastened
with
a
strap
so
that
his
shirt
showed
below
his
vest
he
had
no
collar
and
he
had
allowed
his
beard
to
grow
a
straggling
thin
beard
through
which
one
could
see
the
buttons
of
his
shirt
a
dirty
beard
full
of
the
cracker
crumbs
from
the
free
of
cheap
saloons
he
had
on
a
hat
which
he
had
worn
when
they
had
known
him
but
one
should
see
that
hat
now
it
was
all
true
little
by
little
vandover
had
abandoned
all
interest
in
his
personal
appearance
of
course
it
was
impossible
for
him
to
dress
well
at
this
time
but
he
had
even
lost
regard
for
decency
and
cleanliness
he
washed
himself
but
rarely
he
had
even
acquired
the
habit
of
sleeping
with
all
his
clothes
on
during
the
colder
nights
of
the
year
nothing
made
any
difference
gradually
his
mind
grew
more
and
more
clouded
he
became
stupid
sluggish
he
went
about
the
city
from
dawn
to
dark
his
feet
dragging
his
head
hanging
low
and
swinging
from
side
to
side
with
the
motion
of
his
gait
he
rarely
spoke
his
eyes
took
on
a
dull
glazed
appearance
filmy
like
the
eyes
of
a
dead
fish
at
certain
intervals
his
mania
came
upon
him
the
strange
hallucination
of
something
the
persistent
fancy
that
the
brute
in
him
had
now
grown
so
large
so
insatiable
that
it
had
taken
everything
even
to
his
very
self
his
own
identity
that
he
had
literally
the
the
attack
passed
off
and
left
him
wondering
perplexed
the
reno
house
where
vandover
had
lived
for
some
fifteen
months
was
a
sort
of
hotel
on
sacramento
street
below
kearney
the
neighbourhood
was
low
just
on
the
edge
of
the
barbary
coast
abounding
in
stores
for
clothing
saloons
pawnshops
and
the
shops
of
chinese
cobblers
around
the
corner
on
kearney
street
was
a
concert
hall
a
dive
to
which
the
admission
was
free
near
by
was
the
old
plaza
underneath
the
hotel
on
the
ground
floor
were
two
saloons
a
barber
shop
and
a
broom
manufactory
the
lodgers
themselves
were
for
the
most
part
transients
sailors
lounging
about
shore
between
two
voyages
swedes
and
danes
farmhands
and
from
distant
parts
of
the
state
a
few
lost
women
and
japanese
cooks
and
remaining
there
while
they
advertised
for
positions
vandover
sank
to
the
grade
of
these
people
at
once
with
that
fatal
adaptability
to
environment
which
he
had
permitted
himself
to
foster
throughout
his
entire
life
and
which
had
led
him
to
be
contented
in
almost
any
circumstances
it
was
as
if
the
brute
in
him
were
forever
seeking
a
lower
level
wallowing
itself
lower
and
lower
into
the
filth
and
into
the
mire
content
to
be
foul
content
to
be
prone
to
be
inert
and
supine
it
was
saturday
morning
about
a
quarter
of
nine
the
wet
season
had
begun
early
that
year
though
this
was
but
the
middle
of
september
the
rain
had
fallen
steadily
since
the
previous
wednesday
its
steady
murmur
prolonged
and
soothing
like
the
purring
of
a
great
cat
filled
vandover
room
with
a
pleasant
sound
the
air
of
the
room
was
thick
and
foul
heavy
with
the
odour
of
cooking
onions
and
stale
bedding
it
was
very
warm
there
was
no
ventilation
vandover
lay
upon
the
bed
half
awake
dozing
under
the
thick
coarse
blankets
and
soiled
counterpane
with
the
exception
of
his
shoes
and
coat
he
wore
all
his
clothes
he
was
glad
to
be
warm
to
be
stupefied
by
the
heat
of
the
bedding
and
the
bad
air
of
the
room
in
the
next
room
a
portuguese
fruit
vender
very
drunk
was
fighting
with
the
tin
pitcher
and
pasteboard
bowl
on
his
trying
to
wet
his
head
swearing
and
making
a
hideous
clatter
at
length
he
tipped
them
over
upon
the
floor
and
gave
the
pitcher
a
great
kick
the
noise
roused
vandover
he
sat
up
in
bed
stretching
rubbing
his
hands
over
his
face
about
the
same
moment
the
clock
in
the
office
downstairs
struck
nine
vandover
let
his
feet
drop
to
the
floor
and
sat
on
the
edge
of
the
bed
looking
vaguely
about
him
his
face
ordinarily
very
pale
was
oily
from
sleep
and
red
upon
one
side
from
long
contact
with
the
pillow
the
marks
of
the
creases
still
showing
upon
his
cheek
his
long
straight
hair
fell
about
his
eyes
and
ears
like
a
tangled
mane
a
thin
straggling
beard
and
moustache
of
a
brown
much
lighter
than
his
hair
covered
the
lower
part
of
his
face
his
nose
was
long
and
pinched
while
brown
and
puffed
pockets
hung
beneath
his
eyes
he
wore
a
white
shirt
very
crumpled
and
dirty
a
low
standing
collar
and
a
black
necktie
very
greasy
his
trousers
were
striped
and
of
a
slate
blue
colour
the
blue
pants
of
the
clothing
stores
still
sitting
on
the
bed
vandover
continued
his
stupid
gaze
about
the
room
the
room
was
small
and
at
some
almost
prehistoric
period
had
been
covered
with
a
yellowish
paper
stamped
with
a
huge
pattern
of
flowers
that
looked
like
the
flora
of
a
carboniferous
strata
a
pattern
repeated
to
infinity
wherever
the
eye
turned
newspapers
were
pasted
upon
the
ceiling
and
a
great
square
of
very
dirty
matting
covered
the
floor
there
were
a
few
pieces
of
furniture
very
made
of
pine
with
a
black
walnut
veneer
two
chairs
a
washstand
and
the
bed
a
great
pile
of
old
newspapers
tied
up
with
bale
rope
was
kicked
into
one
corner
two
gas
brackets
without
globes
stretched
forth
their
long
arms
over
the
empty
space
where
the
bureau
should
have
been
under
the
single
window
was
vandover
trunk
and
upon
it
his
colour
box
and
pots
of
paint
his
hat
hung
upon
a
hook
screwed
to
the
door
the
hat
had
once
been
black
but
it
had
long
since
turned
to
a
greenish
hue
and
sweat
stains
were
showing
about
the
band
vandover
dressed
slowly
he
straightened
his
hair
a
bit
before
the
cheap
mirror
that
hung
over
the
washstand
putting
on
his
hat
immediately
after
to
keep
it
in
place
he
washed
his
hands
in
the
dirty
water
that
had
stood
in
his
pasteboard
bowl
since
the
previous
afternoon
but
left
his
face
as
it
was
he
put
on
his
coat
an
old
cutaway
which
had
been
his
best
years
ago
but
which
was
now
absurdly
small
for
him
the
breast
all
spotted
and
streaked
with
old
stains
of
soup
and
gravy
last
of
all
he
drew
on
his
shoes
they
were
new
vandover
had
bought
them
two
days
before
for
a
dollar
and
ninety
cents
they
were
lined
so
as
to
make
socks
superfluous
it
had
been
a
bad
week
with
vandover
the
had
given
him
no
work
to
do
for
ten
days
and
he
had
been
forced
to
get
along
in
some
way
upon
the
interest
of
his
bonds
that
is
to
say
upon
five
dollars
and
cents
a
week
two
dollars
and
cents
of
this
went
for
his
room
rent
one
dollar
and
ninety
for
his
shoes
and
tuesday
afternoon
he
had
bought
a
package
of
cigarettes
for
ten
cents
by
saturday
morning
he
had
spent
cents
for
food
when
the
gave
him
enough
work
it
was
vandover
custom
to
buy
a
week
commutation
ticket
at
a
certain
restaurant
he
never
ate
at
the
hotel
it
was
too
expensive
by
the
commutation
system
he
could
buy
two
dollars
and
cents
worth
of
meals
for
two
dollars
paying
in
tickets
at
each
meal
but
such
a
thing
had
been
impossible
this
week
he
had
been
forced
to
fall
back
upon
the
system
in
two
years
vandover
had
learned
a
great
deal
even
his
dulled
wits
had
been
sharpened
when
it
had
come
to
a
question
of
food
the
brute
in
him
might
destroy
all
his
finer
qualities
but
even
the
brute
had
to
feed
when
work
failed
him
at
the
beginning
of
the
week
vandover
was
not
unprepared
for
the
contingency
the
thing
had
happened
before
and
he
knew
how
to
meet
it
on
monday
he
beat
up
and
down
the
barbary
coast
picking
out
fifteen
or
twenty
saloons
which
supported
a
counter
in
connection
with
the
bar
he
took
his
breakfast
monday
morning
at
the
first
of
these
he
paid
five
cents
for
a
glass
of
beer
and
ate
his
morning
meal
at
the
lunch
counter
stew
bread
and
cheese
at
noon
he
made
his
dinner
at
the
second
saloon
on
his
route
here
he
had
another
glass
of
beer
a
great
plate
of
soup
potato
salad
and
pretzels
thus
he
managed
to
feed
himself
throughout
the
week
it
was
always
his
great
desire
to
feed
well
at
sunday
dinner
to
spend
at
least
a
quarter
on
that
meal
it
was
something
to
be
looked
forward
to
throughout
the
entire
week
but
to
get
cents
ahead
when
he
was
out
of
work
was
bitter
hard
that
week
he
had
started
out
with
the
determination
to
eat
but
two
meals
a
day
he
would
thus
save
five
cents
daily
and
by
sunday
morning
would
be
thirty
cents
to
the
good
but
each
day
his
resolution
broke
down
at
breakfast
he
would
resolve
to
go
without
his
lunch
at
lunch
he
would
make
up
his
mind
to
go
without
supper
and
at
supper
he
would
tell
himself
that
now
at
least
his
determination
was
irrevocable
he
would
eat
no
breakfast
the
next
morning
but
on
each
and
every
occasion
his
hunger
proved
too
strong
his
feet
carried
him
irresistibly
to
the
saloon
lunch
counters
whether
he
would
or
no
at
no
time
in
his
life
had
vandover
accustomed
himself
to
he
could
hardly
begin
now
at
length
saturday
morning
had
come
and
while
he
was
dressing
he
realized
that
he
could
not
look
forward
to
any
unusual
dinner
the
next
day
at
noon
the
disappointment
had
all
the
force
of
an
unexpected
disaster
and
he
began
keenly
to
regret
his
weakness
of
the
past
week
suddenly
vandover
resolved
that
he
would
go
without
food
all
that
day
it
would
be
a
saving
of
fifteen
cents
which
added
to
the
five
cents
that
he
would
spend
anyway
for
his
dinner
would
almost
make
a
quarter
he
knew
where
he
could
dine
excellently
well
for
twenty
cents
however
he
could
not
make
up
his
mind
to
go
without
his
sunday
breakfast
that
he
told
himself
he
must
eat
once
dressed
vandover
went
out
fortunately
the
rain
had
stopped
he
went
on
down
through
the
reeking
steaming
streets
to
one
of
the
big
fruit
markets
not
far
from
the
water
front
the
portuguese
fruit
vender
who
roomed
next
to
him
at
the
reno
house
was
employed
at
a
stall
here
vandover
knew
him
a
little
and
it
was
not
hard
for
him
to
get
a
thin
slice
of
cocoanut
out
from
the
inside
rind
of
one
of
those
that
were
lying
cracked
open
among
his
other
wares
all
the
morning
vandover
chewed
this
slice
of
cocoanut
at
the
same
time
drinking
a
great
deal
of
water
for
hours
he
deadened
the
pang
of
hunger
by
this
means
he
passed
the
time
for
the
most
part
sitting
on
the
benches
in
the
plaza
reading
an
old
newspaper
that
he
had
found
under
a
seat
the
sun
came
out
a
little
vandover
found
the
warmth
very
grateful
he
told
himself
that
he
could
easily
hold
out
until
the
next
morning
he
had
forgotten
about
the
time
and
was
surprised
when
the
whistles
all
over
the
town
began
to
blow
for
noon
in
an
instant
vandover
was
hungry
again
it
was
all
one
that
he
chewed
the
little
pulp
of
cocoanut
rind
more
vigorously
than
ever
swallowed
great
draughts
of
water
at
the
public
fountains
the
little
gnawing
just
between
his
chest
and
his
stomach
began
to
persist
he
got
up
and
began
to
walk
he
left
the
plaza
behind
him
crossed
kearney
street
and
went
on
down
clay
street
till
he
reached
the
water
front
for
a
time
he
found
a
certain
diversion
among
the
shipping
and
especially
in
watching
a
gang
of
caulkers
knocking
away
at
the
seams
of
an
immense
coal
steamer
he
sat
upon
a
great
iron
clamped
pile
spitting
into
the
yellow
water
below
the
air
was
full
of
the
smell
of
bilge
and
oakum
and
fish
the
thousands
of
masts
made
a
gray
maze
against
the
sky
occasionally
an
empty
truck
trundled
over
the
hollow
docks
with
a
sound
of
distant
cannon
a
weakness
a
little
trembling
that
seemed
to
come
from
the
pit
of
his
stomach
began
upon
vandover
he
was
very
hungry
evidently
the
slice
of
cocoanut
was
no
longer
effective
he
swallowed
it
and
lit
a
cigarette
one
of
the
still
left
of
the
pack
he
had
bought
the
tuesday
before
he
smoked
the
cigarette
slowly
inhaling
as
much
of
the
smoke
as
he
could
this
quieted
him
for
an
hour
but
he
had
the
folly
to
smoke
again
at
the
end
of
that
time
and
at
once
as
he
might
have
known
was
hungry
again
until
dark
he
struggled
along
drinking
water
continually
chewing
chips
of
wood
toothpicks
bits
of
straw
anything
so
that
the
action
of
his
jaws
might
cheat
the
demands
of
his
stomach
toward
seven
in
the
evening
he
returned
to
his
room
in
the
reno
house
if
he
could
get
to
sleep
that
would
be
best
of
all
on
the
stairs
of
the
hotel
while
going
up
to
his
room
the
strong
smell
of
cooking
onions
came
suddenly
to
his
nostrils
it
was
delicious
vandover
breathed
in
the
warm
savour
with
long
sighs
closing
his
eyes
a
great
feebleness
overcame
him
he
asked
himself
how
he
could
get
through
the
next
twelve
hours
an
hour
later
he
went
to
bed
hiccoughing
from
the
water
he
had
been
drinking
all
day
by
this
time
he
had
torn
the
paper
from
one
of
his
cigarettes
and
was
chewing
the
tobacco
this
was
his
last
resort
an
expedient
which
he
fell
back
upon
only
in
great
extremity
as
it
invariably
made
him
sick
to
his
stomach
he
slept
a
little
but
in
half
an
hour
was
broad
awake
again
gagging
and
retching
dreadfully
there
was
nothing
on
his
stomach
to
throw
up
and
now
at
length
the
hunger
in
him
raged
like
a
wolf
vandover
was
in
veritable
torment
he
could
not
keep
his
thoughts
away
from
the
money
in
his
pocket
a
nickel
and
two
dimes
he
could
eat
if
he
wanted
to
could
satisfy
this
incessant
craving
at
every
moment
the
temptation
grew
stronger
why
should
he
wait
until
morning
he
had
the
money
it
was
only
a
matter
of
a
few
minutes
walk
to
the
nearest
saloon
but
he
set
his
face
against
this
desire
he
had
held
out
so
long
that
it
would
be
a
pity
to
give
in
now
he
was
not
so
very
hungry
after
all
no
no
he
would
not
give
in
he
was
strong
enough
as
long
as
he
used
his
will
he
need
not
succumb
it
was
just
a
question
of
asserting
his
strength
of
mind
of
calling
up
the
better
part
of
him
even
better
than
eating
would
be
the
satisfaction
of
knowing
that
he
had
shown
himself
stronger
than
his
lower
animal
appetite
no
he
would
not
give
in
hardly
a
minute
after
he
had
arrived
at
this
resolution
vandover
found
himself
drawing
on
his
coat
and
shoes
making
ready
to
go
out
to
go
out
and
eat
the
gas
in
the
room
was
lit
his
money
the
nickel
and
the
two
dimes
was
shut
in
one
of
his
fists
he
was
dressing
himself
with
one
hand
dressing
with
feverish
precipitate
haste
what
had
happened
he
marvelled
at
himself
but
did
not
check
his
preparations
an
instant
he
could
not
stop
whether
he
would
or
no
there
was
something
in
him
stronger
than
himself
something
that
urged
him
on
his
feet
that
drove
him
out
into
the
street
something
that
clamoured
for
food
and
that
would
not
be
gainsaid
it
was
the
animal
in
him
the
brute
that
would
be
fed
the
evil
hideous
brute
grown
now
so
strong
that
vandover
could
not
longer
resist
it
the
brute
that
had
long
since
destroyed
all
his
finer
qualities
but
that
still
demanded
to
be
fed
still
demanded
to
live
all
the
little
money
that
vandover
had
saved
during
the
day
he
spent
that
night
among
the
coffee
houses
the
restaurants
and
the
saloons
of
the
barbary
coast
continuing
to
eat
even
after
his
hunger
was
satisfied
toward
daylight
he
returned
to
his
room
and
all
dressed
as
he
was
flung
himself
face
downward
among
the
coarse
blankets
and
greasy
counterpane
for
nearly
eight
hours
he
slept
profoundly
with
long
snores
prone
inert
crammed
and
gorged
with
food
it
was
the
middle
of
sunday
afternoon
when
he
awoke
he
roused
himself
and
going
over
to
the
plaza
sat
for
a
long
while
upon
one
of
the
benches
it
was
a
very
bright
afternoon
and
vandover
sat
motionless
for
a
long
time
in
the
sun
while
his
heavy
meal
digested
very
happy
content
merely
to
be
warm
to
be
well
fed
to
be
comfortable
chapter
eighteen
that
winter
passed
then
the
summer
september
and
october
came
and
went
and
by
the
middle
of
november
the
rains
set
in
one
very
wet
afternoon
toward
the
end
of
the
month
charlie
geary
sat
at
his
desk
in
his
own
private
office
he
was
unoccupied
for
the
moment
leaning
back
in
his
swivel
chair
his
feet
on
the
table
smoking
a
cigar
geary
had
broken
from
his
habit
of
smoking
only
so
many
cigars
as
he
could
pay
for
by
saving
carfare
he
was
doing
so
well
now
that
he
could
afford
to
smoke
whenever
he
chose
he
was
still
with
the
great
firm
of
beale
storey
and
while
not
in
the
partnership
as
yet
had
worked
up
to
the
position
of
an
assistant
he
had
cases
of
his
own
now
a
great
many
of
them
for
the
most
part
damage
suits
against
that
certain
enormous
corporation
whom
it
was
said
was
ruining
the
city
and
entire
state
geary
posed
as
one
of
its
bitterest
enemies
pushing
each
suit
brought
against
it
with
a
tireless
energy
with
a
zeal
that
was
almost
vindictive
he
began
to
fit
into
his
own
niche
in
the
eyes
of
the
public
and
just
in
proportion
as
the
corporation
was
hated
geary
was
admired
money
came
to
him
very
fast
he
was
hardly
thirty
at
this
time
but
could
already
be
called
a
rich
man
his
deal
with
vandover
had
given
him
a
taste
for
real
estate
and
now
and
then
with
the
greatest
caution
he
made
a
few
discreet
investments
at
present
he
had
just
completed
a
row
of
small
cottages
across
the
street
from
the
boot
and
shoe
factory
the
cottages
held
two
rooms
and
a
large
kitchen
geary
had
calculated
that
the
boot
and
shoe
concern
would
employ
nearly
a
thousand
operatives
and
he
had
built
his
row
with
the
view
of
accommodating
a
few
of
them
who
had
families
and
who
desired
to
live
near
the
factory
his
agents
were
adams
brunt
it
was
toward
five
there
was
nothing
more
that
geary
could
do
that
day
and
for
a
moment
he
leaned
back
in
his
swivel
chair
before
going
home
smiling
a
little
very
well
pleased
with
himself
he
was
still
as
clever
and
shrewd
as
ever
still
devoured
with
an
incarnate
ambition
still
delighted
when
he
could
get
the
better
of
any
one
he
was
yet
a
young
man
with
the
start
he
had
secured
for
himself
and
with
the
exceptional
faculties
the
faculties
of
and
push
that
he
knew
himself
to
possess
there
was
no
telling
to
what
position
he
might
attain
he
knew
that
it
was
only
a
question
of
time
of
a
short
time
even
when
he
would
be
the
practical
head
of
the
great
firm
everything
he
turned
his
hand
to
was
a
success
his
row
of
houses
in
the
mission
might
be
enlarged
to
a
veritable
settlement
for
every
workman
in
the
neighbourhood
his
youth
his
cleverness
and
his
ambition
supported
by
his
money
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
by
the
vast
machinery
of
the
great
law
firm
could
raise
him
to
a
great
place
in
the
world
of
men
gazing
through
the
little
blue
haze
of
his
cigar
smoke
he
began
to
have
vague
ideas
ideas
of
advancement
of
political
successes
politics
fascinated
him
such
a
field
of
action
seemed
to
be
the
domain
for
which
he
was
precisely
suited
not
the
politics
of
the
city
or
of
the
state
not
the
nasty
little
squabbling
of
boodlers
lobbyists
and
supervisors
but
something
large
something
inspiring
something
on
a
tremendous
scale
something
to
which
one
could
give
up
one
whole
life
and
energy
something
to
which
one
could
sacrifice
everything
friendships
fortunes
scruples
principles
life
itself
no
matter
what
anything
to
be
a
success
to
arrive
to
get
there
to
attain
the
desired
object
in
spite
of
the
whole
world
to
ride
on
at
it
trampling
down
or
smashing
through
everything
that
stood
in
the
way
blind
deaf
fists
and
teeth
shut
tight
not
the
little
squabbling
politics
of
the
city
or
state
but
national
politics
the
sway
and
government
of
a
whole
people
the
house
the
senate
the
cabinet
and
the
next
why
not
the
highest
the
best
of
all
the
executive
yes
geary
aspired
even
to
the
presidency
for
a
moment
he
allowed
himself
the
indulgence
of
the
delightful
dream
then
laughed
a
bit
at
his
own
absurdity
but
even
the
entertainment
of
so
vast
an
idea
had
made
his
mind
as
it
were
big
it
was
hard
to
come
down
to
the
level
again
in
spite
of
himself
he
went
on
reasoning
in
stupendous
thoughts
in
enormous
ideas
figuring
with
immense
abstractions
and
then
after
all
why
not
other
men
had
striven
and
attained
other
men
were
even
now
striving
other
men
would
arrive
why
should
not
he
as
well
he
as
another
every
man
for
himself
that
was
his
maxim
it
might
be
damned
selfish
but
it
was
human
nature
the
weakest
to
the
wall
the
strongest
to
the
front
why
should
not
he
be
in
the
front
why
not
in
the
very
front
rank
why
not
be
even
before
the
front
rank
itself
the
leader
vast
vague
ideas
passed
slowly
across
the
vision
of
his
mind
ideas
that
could
hardly
be
formulated
into
thought
ideas
of
the
infinite
herd
of
humanity
driven
on
as
if
by
some
enormous
relentless
engine
driven
on
toward
some
fearful
distant
bourne
driven
on
recklessly
at
headlong
speed
all
life
was
but
a
struggle
to
keep
from
under
those
myriad
spinning
wheels
that
dashed
so
close
behind
those
were
happiest
who
were
farthest
to
the
front
to
lag
behind
was
peril
to
fall
was
to
perish
to
be
ridden
down
to
be
beaten
to
the
dust
to
be
inexorably
crushed
and
blotted
out
beneath
that
myriad
of
spinning
iron
wheels
geary
looked
up
quickly
and
saw
vandover
standing
in
the
doorway
for
the
moment
geary
did
not
recognize
the
gaunt
shambling
figure
with
the
long
hair
and
dirty
beard
the
greenish
hat
and
the
streaked
and
spotted
coat
but
when
he
did
it
was
with
a
feeling
of
anger
and
exasperation
look
here
he
cried
do
you
think
you
better
knock
before
you
come
in
vandover
raised
a
hand
slowly
as
if
in
deprecation
and
answered
slowly
and
with
a
feeble
tremulous
voice
the
voice
of
an
old
man
i
did
knock
mister
geary
i
did
mean
no
offence
he
sat
down
on
the
edge
of
the
nearest
chair
looking
vaguely
and
stupidly
about
on
the
floor
moving
his
head
instead
of
his
eyes
repeating
under
his
breath
from
time
to
time
no
offence
no
sir
no
offence
shut
that
door
commanded
geary
vandover
obeyed
he
wore
no
vest
and
the
old
cutaway
coat
fastened
by
the
single
remaining
button
exposed
his
shirt
to
view
abominably
filthy
bulging
at
the
waist
like
a
blouse
the
blue
pants
held
up
by
a
strap
were
all
foul
with
mud
and
grease
and
paint
and
there
hung
about
him
a
certain
odour
that
peculiar
smell
of
poverty
and
of
degradation
the
smell
of
stale
clothes
and
of
unwashed
bodies
well
said
geary
abruptly
vandover
put
the
tips
of
his
fingers
to
his
lips
and
rolled
his
eyes
about
the
room
avoiding
geary
glance
then
he
dropped
them
to
the
floor
again
looking
at
the
pattern
in
the
carpet
well
repeated
geary
irritated
you
know
i
have
got
all
the
time
in
the
world
all
at
once
vandover
began
to
cry
very
softly
snuffling
with
his
nose
his
chin
twitching
the
tears
running
through
his
thin
sparse
beard
ah
get
on
to
yourself
shouted
geary
now
thoroughly
disgusted
quit
that
be
a
man
will
you
stop
that
do
you
hear
vandover
obeyed
catching
his
breath
and
slowly
wiping
his
eyes
with
the
side
of
his
hand
i
no
good
he
said
at
length
wagging
his
head
and
blinking
through
his
tears
i
i
done
for
and
i
ai
got
no
money
yet
of
course
you
see
i
do
mean
no
offence
what
i
want
you
see
is
to
be
a
man
and
not
give
in
and
not
let
the
wolf
get
me
and
then
i
go
back
to
paris
everything
goes
round
here
very
slow
and
seems
far
off
why
i
ca
get
along
and
i
that
hungry
that
sometimes
i
twitch
all
over
i
down
i
ai
got
another
cent
of
money
and
i
lost
my
job
at
the

where
i
drew

then
geary
interrupted
him
crying
out

a
cent

what

you
done
with
your
bonds
bonds
repeated
vandover
dazed
and
bewildered
i
ai
never
had
any
bonds
what
bonds
oh

he
exclaimed
suddenly
remembering
yes
i
know
my
bonds
of
course

had
to
sell

bonds

i
get
so
hungry
sometimes
that
i
twitch
all
over
so
just
like
that
lend
me
a
dollar
for
a
few
moments
geary
was
silent
watching
vandover
curiously
as
he
sat
in
a
heap
on
the
edge
of
the
chair
fumbling
his
greenish
hat
looking
about
the
floor
presently
he
asked
when
did
you
lose
your
job
at
the
day
before
yesterday
and
you

out
of

suddenly
exclaimed
nodding
his
head
toward
him
reflectively
i

pitiable
looking
object
but
i

it

long
as

all
my
money
to
help
another
poor
duck

him
thousands
he
was
good
to
me
when
i
was
on
my
uppers
and
i
meant
to
repay
him
i

grateful
i
signed
a
paper
that
gave
him
everything
i
had
it
was
in
paris
there
where
my
bonds
went
to
he
was
a
struggling
artist
look

said
geary
willing
to
be
interested
you
might
as
well
be
truthful
with
me
you
ca
lie
to
me
have
you
gambled

those
bonds
or
have
you
been
victimized
or
have
you
still
got
them
come
now
spit
it
out
charlie
i
have
a
cent
answered
vandover
looking
him
squarely
in
the
face
would
i
be
around
here
and
trying
to
get
work
from
you
if
i
had
no
i
gambled
it
all
away
you
know
i
had
hundred
in
per
cents
well
first
i
began
to
pawn
things
when
my
money
got
short
the
old
gentleman
watch
that
i
said
i
never
would
part
with
then
my
clothes
i
could
keep
away
from
the
cards
of
course
you
ca
understand
that
gambling
was
the
only
thing
that
could
amuse
me
then
i
began
to
mortgage
my
bonds
very
little
at
first
oh
i
went
slow
then
i
got
to
selling
them
well
somehow
they
all
went
for
a
time
i
got
along
by
the
work
at
the
but
they
have
let
me
out
now
said
i
was
so
irregular
i
owe
for
nearly
a
month
at
my
his
eyes
sought
the
floor
again
rolling
about
stupidly
nearly
a
month
and
that
what
makes
me
jump
and
tremble
so
you
ought
to
see
me
sometimes
and
i
get
to
barking
i
a
wolf
mostly
you
know
or
some
kind
of
an
animal
some
kind
of
a
brute
but
i
be
all
right
if
everything
did
go
round
very
slowly
and
seem
far
off
but
i
a
wolf
you
look
out
for
me
best
take
care
i
do
bite
you
wolf
wolf
ah
it
up
four
flights
at
the
end
of
the
hall
very
dark
eight
thousand
dollars
in
a
green
cloth
sack
and
lots
of
lights
see
how
long
my
finger
nails
are
regular
claws
that
the
wolf
the
brute
why
ca
i
talk
in
my
mouth
instead
of
in
my
throat
that
the
devil
of
it
when
you
paint
on
steel
and
iron
your
colours
do
dry
out
true
all
the
yellows
turn
green
but
it
would
been
all
straight
if
they
had
fired
me
i
never
talked
to
anybody
that
was
business
was
it
and
when
all
those
eight
thousand
little
lights
begin
to
burn
red
why
of
course
that
makes
you
nervous
so
i
have
to
drink
a
great
deal
of
water
and
chew
butcher
paper
that
fools
him
and
he
thinks
he
eating
just
so
as
i
can
lay
quiet
in
the
plaza
when
the
sun
is
out
there
a
there
you
know
and
every
time
that
horse
tosses
his
head
so
to
get
the
oats
in
the
bottom
of
the
he
jingles
the
chains
on
the
poles
and
by
god
funny
makes
me
laugh
every
time
sounds
gay
and
the
chain
sparkles
mighty
pretty
oh
i
do
complain
give
me
a
dollar
and
i
bark
for
you
geary
leaned
back
in
his
chair
listening
to
vandover
struck
with
wonder
marvelling
at
that
which
his
old
chum
had
come
to
be
he
was
sorry
for
him
too
yet
nevertheless
he
felt
a
certain
indefinite
satisfaction
a
faint
exultation
over
his
misfortunes
glad
that
their
positions
were
not
reversed
pleased
that
he
had
been
clever
enough
to
keep
free
from
those
habits
those
modes
of
life
that
ended
in
such
fashion
he
rapped
sharply
on
the
table
vandover
straightened
up
raising
his
eyes
you
want
some
work
he
demanded
yes
that
what
i
after
answered
vandover
adding
i
must
have
it
well
said
geary
hesitatingly
i
can
give
you
something
to
do
but
it
will
be
pretty
dirty
vandover
smiled
a
little
saying
i
guess
you
ca
give
me
any
work
that
would
be
too
dirty
for
me
with
the
words
he
suddenly
began
to
cry
again
i
want
to
be
honest
mister
geary
he
exclaimed
drawing
the
backs
of
his
fingers
across
his
lips
i
want
to
be
honest
i
down
and
i
do
mean
no
offence
charlie

i
were
old
chums

at
harvard

god
to
think
i
was
a
harvard
man

goner

in
a
lately

landscapes

lakes
with
mountains
around
them
i
pulled
down
my
twenty
dollars
and
findings

geary
ashamed
even
to
see
such
an
exhibition
if
you

be
a
man

can
get
out
now

here
you
came
up
here
once
and
insulted
me
in
my
office
and
called
me
a
swindler
ah
you
bet
you
had
the
swelled
head
then
and
insulted
me
attacked
my
honesty
and
charged
me
with
shoving
the
queer
now
i
never
forget
those
things
generally
but
i
am
willing
to
let
that
pass
this
time
i
could
be
nasty
now
and
tell
you
to
rustle
for
yourself
if
you
want
half
a
dollar
now
to
get
something
to
eat
why
i
give
it
to
you
but
i
do
propose
to
support
you
ah
no
i
guess
not
if
you
want
to
work
i
give
you
a
chance
but
i
shall
expect
you
to
do
good
work
if
i
give
you
my
good
money
for
it
you
may
be
drunk
now
or
do
know
what
the
matter
with
you
but
you
come
up
here
at
noon
and
if
you
come
up
here
sober
or
straight
or
geary
began
to
make
awkward
gestures
in
the
air
with
both
hands
come
up
here
to
talk
i
may
have
something
for
you
but
i
ca
stop
any
longer
this
evening
vandover
got
upon
his
feet
slowly
turning
his
greenish
hat
about
by
the
brim
nodding
his
head
all
right
all
right
he
answered
thank
you
very
much
mister
geary
it
very
good
of
you
i
sure
i
be
around
at
noon
sure
when
geary
was
left
alone
he
walked
slowly
to
his
window
and
stood
there
a
moment
looking
aimlessly
down
into
the
street
shaking
his
head
repeatedly
astonished
at
the
degradation
of
his
chum
while
he
stood
there
he
saw
vandover
come
out
upon
the
sidewalk
from
the
door
of
the
great
office
building
geary
watched
him
very
interested
vandover
paused
a
moment
upon
the
sidewalk
turning
up
the
collar
of
his
old
cutaway
coat
against
the
cold
trade
wind
that
was
tearing
through
the
streets
he
thrust
both
his
hands
deep
into
his
trousers
pockets
gripping
his
sides
with
his
elbows
and
drawing
his
shoulders
together
shrinking
into
a
small
compass
in
order
to
be
warm
the
wind
blew
the
tails
of
his
cutaway
about
him
like
flapping
wings
he
went
up
the
street
walking
fast
keeping
to
the
outside
of
the
sidewalk
his
shoulders
bent
his
head
inclined
against
the
wind
his
feet
dragging
after
him
as
he
walked
for
a
moment
geary
lost
sight
of
him
amid
a
group
of
men
who
were
hoisting
a
piano
upon
a
dray
the
street
was
rather
crowded
with
office
boys
clerks
and
typewriters
going
home
to
supper
and
geary
did
not
catch
sight
of
him
again
immediately
then
all
at
once
he
saw
him
hesitating
on
a
corner
of
kearney
street
waiting
for
an
electric
car
to
pass
he
crossed
the
street
running
his
hands
still
in
his
pockets
and
went
on
hurriedly
dodging
in
and
out
of
the
throng
his
high
shoulders
long
neck
and
greenish
hat
coming
into
sight
at
intervals
for
a
moment
he
paused
to
glance
into
the
show
window
of
a
tobacconist
and
store
a
chinese
woman
passed
him
pattering
along
lamely
her
green
jade
twinkling
in
the
light
of
a
street
lamp
newly
lighted
vandover
looked
after
her
a
moment
gazing
stupidly
then
suddenly
took
up
his
walk
again
zigzagging
amid
the
groups
on
the
asphalt
striding
along
at
a
great
pace
his
head
low
and
swinging
from
side
to
side
as
he
walked
he
was
already
far
down
the
street
it
was
dusk
geary
could
only
catch
glimpses
of
his
head
and
shoulders
at
long
intervals
he
disappeared
about
ten
minutes
before
one
the
next
day
as
geary
came
back
from
lunch
he
was
surprised
to
see
vandover
peeping
through
the
door
of
his
office
he
had
not
thought
that
vandover
would
come
back
of
the
many
different
stories
that
vandover
had
told
about
the
disappearance
of
his
bonds
the
one
that
was
probably
truest
was
the
one
that
accounted
for
the
thing
by
his
passion
for
gambling
for
a
long
time
after
his
advent
at
the
reno
house
this
passion
had
been
dormant
he
knew
no
one
with
whom
he
could
play
and
every
cent
of
his
income
now
went
for
food
and
lodging
but
one
day
about
six
months
before
his
visit
to
geary
office
vandover
saw
that
the
proprietor
of
the
reno
house
had
set
up
a
great
bagatelle
board
in
a
corner
of
the
a
group
of
men
sailors
ranchmen
and
fruit
venders
were
already
playing
vandover
approached
and
watched
the
game
very
interested
in
watching
the
uncertain
course
of
the
marble
among
the
pins
the
clear
little
note
of
the
bell
or
the
dry
rattle
as
the
marble
settled
quickly
into
one
of
the
lucky
pockets
thrilled
him
from
head
to
foot
his
hands
trembled
all
at
once
his
whole
left
side
twitched
sharply
from
that
day
the
fate
of
the
rest
of
vandover
little
money
was
decided
in
two
weeks
he
had
lost
twenty
dollars
at
bagatelle
obtaining
the
money
by
selling
a
portion
of
his
bonds
at
a
certain
broker
on
montgomery
street
as
soon
as
he
had
begun
to
gamble
again
the
old
habits
of
extravagance
had
come
back
upon
him
from
the
moment
he
knew
that
he
could
get
all
the
money
he
wanted
by
the
mere
signing
of
a
paper
he
ceased
to
be
economical
scorning
the
former
niggardliness
that
had
led
him
to
starve
on
one
day
that
he
might
feast
the
next
now
he
feasted
every
day
he
still
kept
his
room
at
the
reno
house
but
instead
of
taking
his
meals
by
any
ticket
system
he
began
to
affect
the
restaurants
of
the
spanish
quarter
gorging
himself
with
the
hot
spiced
meals
three
and
four
times
a
day
he
quickly
abandoned
the
bagatelle
board
for
the
gambling
furiously
with
two
of
the
ranchmen
almost
invariably
vandover
lost
and
the
more
he
lost
the
more
eager
and
reckless
he
became
in
a
little
time
he
had
sold
every
one
of
his
bonds
and
had
gambled
away
all
but
twenty
dollars
of
the
money
received
from
the
last
one
sold
this
sum
this
twenty
dollars
vandover
decided
to
husband
carefully
it
was
all
that
was
left
between
him
and
starvation
he
made
up
his
mind
that
he
must
stop
gambling
and
find
something
to
do
he
had
long
since
abandoned
his
work
at
the
but
at
this
time
he
returned
there
and
asked
for
his
old
occupation
they
laughed
in
his
face
was
that
the
way
he
thought
they
did
business
not
much
another
man
had
his
job
a
much
better
man
and
one
who
was
regular
who
could
be
depended
on
that
same
evening
vandover
broke
his
twenty
dollars
and
became
very
drunk
a
game
of
poker
was
started
in
a
back
room
of
one
of
the
saloons
on
the
barbary
coast
one
of
the
players
was
a
rancher
named
toedt
a
at
the
reno
house
but
the
two
other
players
were
strangers
and
there
in
that
narrow
dirty
room
sawdust
on
the
floor
festoons
of
red
and
blue
tissue
paper
adorning
the
single
swinging
lamp
figures
cut
from
of
the
black
crook
pasted
on
the
walls
there
in
the
still
hours
after
midnight
long
after
the
barroom
outside
had
been
closed
for
the
night
the
last
penny
of
vandover
estate
was
gambled
away
the
game
ended
in
a
quarrel
vandover
very
drunk
and
exasperated
at
his
ill
luck
accusing
his
friend
toedt
the
rancher
of
cheating
toedt
kicked
him
in
the
stomach
and
made
him
abominably
sick
then
they
went
away
and
left
vandover
alone
in
the
little
dirty
room
racked
with
nausea
very
drunk
fallen
forward
upon
the
table
and
crying
into
his
folded
arms
after
a
little
he
went
to
sleep
but
the
nausea
continued
nevertheless
and
in
a
few
moments
he
gagged
and
vomited
he
never
moved
he
was
too
drunk
to
wake
his
hands
and
his
the
table
all
about
him
were
foul
beyond
words
but
he
slept
on
in
the
midst
of
it
all
inert
stupefied
a
great
swarm
of
flies
buzzing
about
his
head
and
face
it
was
the
day
after
this
that
he
had
come
to
see
geary
ah
said
geary
as
he
came
up
it
you
is
it
well
i
did
expect
to
see
you
again
sit
down
outside
there
in
the
hall
and
wait
a
few
minutes
i
not
ready
to
go
yet
or
wait
here
i
tell
you
what
to
do
geary
wrote
off
a
list
of
articles
on
a
slip
of
paper
and
pushed
it
across
the
table
toward
vandover
together
with
a
little
money
you
get
those
at
the
nearest
grocery
and
by
the
time
you
are
back
i
be
ready
to
go
that
day
geary
took
vandover
out
to
the
mission
they
went
out
in
the
geary
sitting
inside
reading
the
morning
paper
vandover
standing
on
the
front
platform
carrying
the
things
that
geary
had
told
him
to
buy
a
bar
of
soap
a
scrubbing
brush
some
wiping
cloths
a
broom
and
a
pail
almost
at
the
end
of
the
they
got
off
and
crossed
over
to
where
geary
property
stood
vandover
looked
about
him
the
ground
on
which
his
own
block
had
once
stood
was
now
occupied
by
an
immense
red
brick
building
with
white
stone
trimmings
in
front
on
either
side
of
the
main
entrance
were
white
stone
medallions
upon
which
were
chiselled
the
head
of
a
workman
wearing
the
square
paper
cap
that
the
workman
never
wears
and
a
forearm
the
biceps
enormous
the
fist
gripping
the
short
hammer
that
the
workman
never
uses
an
enormous
round
chimney
sprouted
from
one
corner
through
the
open
windows
came
the
vast
purring
of
machinery
it
was
a
boot
and
shoe
factory
built
by
the
great
concern
who
had
bought
the
piece
of
property
from
geary
for
fifteen
thousand
dollars
the
same
property
geary
had
bought
from
vandover
for
eight
across
the
street
from
the
factory
was
a
long
row
of
little
cottages
very
neat
each
having
a
tiny
garden
in
front
where
nasturtiums
grew
there
were
fifteen
of
these
cottages
three
of
them
only
were
vacant
that
was
idea
observed
geary
as
they
approached
the
row
willing
to
explain
even
though
he
thought
vandover
would
not
comprehend
and
it
pays
like
a
nitrate
bed
i
was
clever
enough
to
see
that
cottages
like
these
were
just
what
wanted
by
the
workmen
in
the
factory
that
have
families
i
made
some
money
when
i
sold
out
my
block
to
the
boot
and
shoe
people
and
i
invested
it
again
in
these
cottages
they
are
cheap
and
serviceable
and
they
meet
the
demand
vandover
nodded
his
head
in
assent
looking
vaguely
about
him
now
at
the
cottages
now
at
the
great
building
across
the
street
geary
got
the
keys
to
one
of
the
vacant
cottages
and
the
two
went

that
out

they

through
the
house
again
and
geary
pointed
out

tiny
garden
to
vandover

that

bit

row

same
place

i
should
think

this
house
this
afternoon
all
right
answered
vandover
i
going
to
look
around
a
little
i
drop
in
again
in
about
an
hour
and
see
how
you
getting
on
with
that
geary
went
away
it
was
saturday
afternoon
and
as
the
law
office
closed
at
noon
that
day
geary
very
often
spent
the
time
until
evening
looking
about
his
property
he
left
vandover
and
went
slowly
down
the
street
noting
each
particular
house
with
immense
satisfaction
even
entering
some
of
them
talking
with
the
womenfolk
all
the
men
being
at
the
factory
vandover
took
off
his
coat
his
old
and
greasy
cutaway
and
began
work
he
drew
a
pail
of
water
from
the
garden
faucet
in
a
neighbour
yard
and
commenced
washing
the
windows
first
he
washed
the
panes
from
the
inside
very
careful
not
to
disturb
adams
brunt
signs
and
then
cleaned
the
outside
sitting
upon
the
window
ledge
his
body
half
in
and
half
out
of
the
house
geary
enjoyed
himself
immensely
the
news
of
the
landlord
visit
had
spread
from
cottage
to
cottage
awakening
a
mild
excitement
throughout
the
length
of
the
row
the
women
showed
themselves
on
the
steps
or
on
the
sidewalks
very
slatternly
without
corsets
their
hair
coming
down
dressed
in
faded
calico
wrappers
just
as
they
had
come
from
the
laundry
tubs
or
the
they
bethought
them
of
their
various
grievances
a
leak
here
a
broken
there
a
certain
bad
smell
that
was
supposed
to
have
some
connection
with
a
rash
upon
the
children
faces
they
waited
for
geary
appearance
by
ones
and
twos
timid
very
respectful
but
querulous
for
all
that
filling
the
air
with
their
lamentations
vandover
had
finished
with
the
windows
now
he
was
cleaning
out
the
sink
and
the
laundry
tubs
they
smelt
very
badly
and
were
all
foul
with
a
greasy
mixture
of
old
lard
soap
soot
and
dust
a
little
mould
was
even
beginning
to
form
about
the
faucets
of
the
tubs
the
escape
pipe
of
the
sink
was
clogged
and
he
had
to
run
his
finger
into
it
again
and
again
to
get
it
free
the
kitchen
was
very
dirty
old
bottles
of
sweet
oil
mouldy
vinegar
and
flat
beer
cluttered
the
dusty
shelves
of
the
pantry
meanwhile
geary
continued
his
rounds
he
went
about
among
the
groups
of
his
tenants
very
pleased
and
contented
smiling
affably
upon
them
he
enlarged
himself
giving
himself
the
airs
of
an
english
lord
in
the
midst
of
his
tenantry
listening
to
their
complaints
with
a
smile
of
toleration
a
few
men
were
about
some
of
whom
were
out
of
work
for
the
moment
others
who
were
sick
to
these
geary
was
particularly
condescending
he
sat
in
their
parlours
little
crowded
rooms
smelling
of
stale
upholstery
and
of
the
last
meal
where
knitted
worsted
tidies
very
gaudy
covered
the
backs
of
the
larger
chairs
and
where
one
inevitably
discovered
the
whatnot
standing
in
one
corner
its
shelves
filled
with
broken
thermometers
and
little
alabaster
jars
shaped
like
funeral
urns
where
one
kept
the
matches
the
wife
brought
the
children
in
very
dirty
looking
solemnly
at
geary
their
eyes
enlarged
in
the
direct
unwinking
gaze
of
cows
by
this
time
vandover
had
finished
with
the
sinks
and
tubs
and
was
down
upon
his
hands
and
knees
scrubbing
the
stains
of
grease
upon
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
it
was
very
hard
work
as
his
water
was
cold
he
was
still
working
about
this
spot
when
geary
returned
by
this
time
vandover
was
so
tired
that
he
trembled
all
over
his
spine
seemed
to
be
breaking
in
two
and
every
now
and
then
he
paused
and
passed
his
hand
over
the
small
of
his
back
closing
his
eyes
and
drawing
a
long
breath
well
how
are
you
getting
on
asked
geary
as
he
came
into
the
kitchen
drawing
on
his
gloves
about
ready
to
go
home
oh
i
getting
along
replied
vandover
rising
up
to
his
knees
you
want
to
hurry
up
answered
geary
you
must
be
done
with
this
house
by
this
evening
you
see
i
want
to
advertise
it
in
papers
all
right
i
have
it
done
pretty
dirty
was
it
yes
pretty
dirty
you
may
have
to
work
here
a
little
later
than
usual
this
afternoon
but
be
sure
you
have
everything
cleaned
up
before
you
leave
geary
said
all
right
answered
vandover
bending
to
his
work
again
just
as
geary
was
leaving
he
had
the
admirable
good
fortune
to
meet
on
the
steps
of
the
cottage
a
little
group
who
were
two
young
women
and
a
little
boy
the
mother
of
the
little
boy
so
she
explained
to
him
was
married
to
one
of
the
burnishers
in
the
factory
the
other
woman
was
her
sister
geary
showed
them
about
the
little
house
very
eager
to
secure
them
as
tenants
then
and
there
he
began
to
sing
its
praises
its
nearness
to
the
factory
its
excellent
plumbing
its
bathroom
and
its
one
stationary
washstand
its
little
garden
and
its
location
on
the
sunny
side
of
the
street
i
a
good
landlord
he
said
to
them
as
he
ushered
them
into
the
kitchen
any
one
in
the
row
will
tell
you
that
i
make
it
a
point
to
keep
my
houses
in
good
repair
and
to
keep
them
clean
you
see
i
have
a
man
here
now
cleaning
out
vandover
glanced
up
at
the
women
an
instant
the
two
of
them
and
the
little
boy
looked
down
at
him
on
all
fours
upon
the
floor
then
he
went
on
with
his
work
this
is
the
kitchen
you
see
pursued
geary
notice
how
large
it
is
you
see
here
are
your
laundry
tubs
your
iron
sink
your
boiler
everything
you
need
of
course
it
a
little
grimy
now
but
by
the
time
the
man
gets
through
it
will
be
as
clean
as
your
face
now
come
downstairs
here
and
i
show
the
basement
in
a
moment
their
voices
sounded
through
the
floor
of
the
kitchen
an
indistinct
continuous
murmur
then
the
party
returned
and
passed
by
vandover
again
and
stood
for
a
long
time
in
the
front
room
haggling
the
cottage
rented
for
fifteen
dollars
the
young
woman
was
willing
to
take
it
at
that
but
with
the
understanding
that
geary
should
pay
the
water
rent
geary
refused
unwilling
even
to
listen
to
such
a
thing
every
other
tenant
in
the
row
paid
for
his
own
water
the
young
women
went
away
shaking
their
heads
sadly
geary
let
them
get
down
the
front
steps
and
then
called
them
back
he
offered
a
compromise
the
young
women
should
pay
for
the
water
but
half
of
their
first
rent
should
be
remitted
the
burnisher
wife
still
hesitated
saying
you
know
yourself
this
house
is
awfully
dirty
well
you
see
i
having
it
cleaned
it
have
to
be
cleaned
pretty
thoroughly
i
ca
stand
it
be
cleaned
thoroughly
persisted
geary
the
man
will
work
at
it
until
it
is
you
can
keep
an
eye
on
him
and
see
that
the
work
is
done
to
suit
you
you
see
objected
the
burnisher
wife
i
would
want
to
move
in
right
away
i
do
want
to
wait
all
week
for
the
man
to
get
through
but
he
is
going
to
be
through
with
this
house
exclaimed
geary
delighted
come
now
i
know
you
want
this
cottage
and
i
would
like
to
have
such
people
have
it
i
know
you
would
make
good
tenants
i
can
find
lots
of
other
tenants
for
this
house
only
you
know
how
it
is
a
nasty
slovenly
woman
about
the
house
and
a
raft
of
dirty
children
and
you
do
like
dirt
i
can
see
that
better
call
it
a
bargain
and
let
it
go
at
that
in
the
end
the
burnisher
wife
took
the
house
geary
even
induced
her
to
deposit
five
dollars
with
him
in
order
to
secure
it
vandover
was
down
in
the
basement
filling
a
barrel
with
the
odds
and
ends
of
rubbish
left
by
the
previous
tenants
broken
bottles
old
corsets
bones
rusty
bedsprings
the
dead
hen
he
had
taken
out
first
of
all
carrying
it
by
one
leg
it
was
a
gruesome
horror
partly
eaten
by
rats
swollen
abnormally
heavy
one
side
flattened
from
lying
so
long
upon
the
floor
he
could
hardly
stand
each
time
he
bent
over
it
seemed
as
though
his
backbone
was
disjointing
after
cleaning
out
the
debris
he
began
to
sweep
the
dust
was
fearful
choking
blinding
so
thick
that
he
could
hardly
see
what
he
was
about
by
and
by
he
dimly
made
out
geary
figure
in
the
doorway
those
people
have
taken
the
house
he
called
out
and
i
promised
them
you
would
be
through
with
it
by
this
evening
so
you
want
to
stay
with
it
now
till
you
finished
i
guess
there
not
much
more
to
do
forget
the
little
garden
in
front
no
i
wo
forget
geary
went
away
and
for
another
hour
vandover
kept
at
his
work
stolidly
his
mind
empty
of
all
thought
knowing
only
that
he
was
very
tired
that
his
back
pained
him
he
finished
with
the
basement
but
as
he
was
pottering
about
the
little
garden
picking
up
the
discoloured
newspapers
with
which
it
was
littered
the
burnisher
wife
returned
together
with
her
sister
and
the
little
boy
the
little
boy
eating
a
slice
of
bread
and
butter
they
the
house
vandover
heard
their
voices
now
in
one
room
now
in
another
they
were
looking
over
their
future
home
again
evidently
they
lived
close
by
suddenly
the
burnisher
wife
came
out
upon
the
front
steps
looking
down
into
the
little
garden
calling
for
vandover
she
was
not
pretty
she
had
a
nose
like
a
man
and
her
chin
was
broad
say
there
she
called
to
vandover
do
you
mean
to
say
that
finished
inside
here
yes
answered
vandover
straightening
up
nodding
his
head
yes
finished
well
just
come
in
here
and
look
at
this
vandover
followed
her
into
the
little
parlour
her
sister
was
there
very
fat
smelling
somehow
of
tallow
candles
and
cooked
cabbage
nearby
stood
the
little
boy
still
eating
his
bread
and
butter
look
at
that
baseboard
exclaimed
the
burnisher
wife
you
never
touched
that
i
bet
a
hat
vandover
did
not
answer
he
brought
in
the
pail
of
water
and
soaping
his
scrubbing
brush
went
down
again
on
his
hands
and
knees
washing
the
paint
on
the
baseboard
where
the
burnisher
wife
indicated
the
two
women
stood
by
looking
on
and
directing
his
movements
the
little
boy
watched
everything
never
speaking
a
word
slowly
eating
his
bread
and
butter
streaks
of
butter
and
bread
clung
to
his
cheeks
stretching
from
the
corners
of
his
mouth
to
his
ears
i
do
see
how
you
come
to
overlook
that
said
the
burnisher
wife
to
vandover
that
the
dirtiest
baseboard
i
ever
saw
oh
my
i
just
ca
naturally
stand
there
you
did
get
that
stain
off
that
tobacco
juice
i
guess
go
back
and
wash
that
over
again
vandover
obeyed
holding
the
brush
in
one
hand
crawling
back
along
the
floor
upon
one
palm
and
his
two
knees
a
pool
of
soapy
dirty
water
very
cold
gathered
about
him
soaking
in
through
the
old
blue
pants
and
wetting
him
to
the
skin
but
he
slovened
through
it
indifferently
put
a
little
more
elbow
grease
to
it
continued
the
burnisher
wife
you
have
to
rub
them
spots
pretty
hard
to
get
out
now
scrub
all
along
here
near
the
floor
you
see
that
streak
there
that
all
gormed
up
with
something
or
other
bugs
get
in
there
mighty
quick
there
do
i
guess
now
is
everything
else
all
clean
mister
geary
said
it
was
to
be
done
to
my
satisfaction
and
that
you
were
to
stay
here
until
everything
was
all
right
all
at
once
her
voice
was
interrupted
by
the
prolonged
roar
of
the
factory
whistle
blowing
as
though
it
would
never
stop
it
was
five
in
an
instant
the
faint
purring
of
the
machinery
dwindled
and
ceased
leaving
an
abrupt
silence
in
the
air
a
moment
later
the
army
of
operatives
began
to
pour
out
of
the
main
entrance
men
and
girls
and
young
boys
all
in
a
great
hurry
the
men
settling
their
coat
collars
as
they
ran
down
the
steps
the
usually
quiet
street
was
crowded
in
an
instant
the
burnisher
wife
stood
on
the
steps
of
the
vacant
house
with
her
sister
watching
the
throng
debouch
into
the
street
all
at
once
the
sister
exclaimed
there
he
is
and
the
other
began
to
call
oscar
oscar
waving
her
hand
to
one
of
the
workmen
on
the
other
side
of
the
street
it
was
her
husband
the
burnisher
and
he
came
across
the
street
crowding
his
lunch
basket
into
the
pocket
of
his
coat
he
was
a
thin
little
man
with
a
timid
air
his
face
white
and
fat
and
covered
with
a
sparse
unshaven
stubble
of
a
pale
straw
colour
an
odour
as
of
a
harness
shop
hung
about
him
vandover
gathered
up
his
broom
and
pail
and
soap
preparing
to
go
home
well
oscar
i
taken
the
house
said
his
wife
to
the
burnisher
as
he
came
up
the
steps
but
i
could
get
him
to
say
that
he
let
me
have
it
for
fifteen
water
the
landlord
himself
geary
was
here
and
i
made
the
dicker
with
him
he
had
a
man
here
all
day
cleaning
up
she
explained
the
bargain
the
burnisher
approving
of
everything
nodding
his
head
continually
his
wife
showed
him
about
the
house
her
sister
and
the
little
boy
following
in
silence
he
a
good
landlord
i
guess
continued
the
young
woman
anybody
in
the
row
will
tell
you
that
and
he
means
to
keep
his
houses
in
good
repair
now
you
see
here
the
kitchen
you
see
how
big
it
is
here
our
laundry
tubs
our
iron
sink
our
boiler
and
everything
we
want
it
all
as
clean
as
a
whistle
and
get
on
to
this
big
cubby
under
the
sink
where
i
can
stow
away
things
she
opened
its
door
to
show
her
husband
but
all
at
once
straightened
up
exclaiming
well
dear
me
did
you
see
anything
like
that
the
cubby
under
the
sink
was
abominably
dirty
vandover
had
altogether
forgotten
it
the
little
burnisher
himself
bent
down
and
peered
in
oh
that
never
do
he
cried
has
that
man
gone
home
yet
he
must
he
got
to
clean
this
out
first
he
had
a
weak
faint
voice
small
and
timid
like
his
figure
he
hurried
out
to
the
front
door
and
called
vandover
back
just
as
he
was
going
down
the
steps
the
two
went
back
into
the
kitchen
and
stood
in
front
of
the
sink
look
under
there
piped
the
burnisher
you
ca
leave
that
that
way
you
know
protested
his
wife
that
this
all
was
to
be
done
to
our
satisfaction
geary
said
so
that
the
only
way
i
came
to
take
the
house
it
about
six
though
observed
her
fat
sister
who
smelt
of
cooked
cabbage
perhaps
he
want
to
go
home
to
his
dinner
but
at
this
both
the
others
cried
out
in
one
voice
the
burnisher
exclaiming
i
ca
help
this
has
got
to
be
done
first
while
his
wife
protested
that
she
could
naturally
stand
dirt
adding
this
all
was
to
be
done
to
our
satisfaction
and
we
ai
satisfied
yet
by
a
long
shot
delighted
at
this
excitement
the
little
boy
forgot
to
eat
into
his
bread
and
butter
rolling
his
eyes
wildly
from
one
to
the
other
still
silent
meanwhile
without
replying
vandover
had
gone
down
upon
the
floor
again
poking
about
amid
the
filth
under
the
sink
the
four
others
the
burnisher
his
wife
his
and
his
little
boy
stood
about
in
a
behind
him
seeing
to
it
that
he
did
the
work
properly
giving
orders
as
to
how
he
should
proceed
now
be
sure
you
get
everything
out
that
under
there
said
the
burnisher
ouf
how
it
smells
they
made
a
regular
dump
heap
of
it
what
that
over
in
the
corner
there
cried
the
wife
bending
down
i
ca
see
it
so
dark
under
there
something
gray
ca
you
see
in
under
there
you
have
to
crawl
way
in
to
get
at
it
go
way
in
vandover
obeyed
the
sink
pipes
were
so
close
above
him
that
he
was
obliged
to
crouch
lower
and
lower
at
length
he
lay
flat
upon
his
stomach
prone
in
the
filth
under
the
sink
in
the
sour
water
the
grease
the
refuse
he
groped
about
with
his
hand
searching
for
the
something
gray
that
the
burnisher
wife
had
seen
he
found
it
and
drew
it
out
it
was
an
old
hambone
covered
with
a
greenish
fuzz
oh
did
you
cried
the
burnisher
holding
up
his
hands
here
do
drop
that
on
my
clean
floor
put
it
in
your
pail
now
get
out
the
rest
of
the
dirt
and
hurry
up
it
late
vandover
crawled
back
half
the
way
under
the
sink
again
this
time
bringing
out
a
rusty
pan
half
full
of
some
kind
of
congealed
gravy
that
exhaled
a
choking
acrid
odour
next
it
was
an
old
stocking
and
then
an
ink
bottle
a
broken
a
battered
teapot
lacking
a
nozzle
a
piece
of
rubber
hose
an
old
comb
choked
with
a
great
handful
of
hair
a
torn
overshoe
newspapers
and
a
great
quantity
of
other
debris
that
had
accumulated
there
during
the
occupancy
of
the
previous
tenant
now
go
over
the
floor
with
a
rag
ordered
the
little
burnisher
when
the
last
of
these
articles
had
been
brought
out
wipe
up
all
that
nasty
muck
look
there
by
your
knee
to
your
left
scrub
that
big
spot
there
with
your
brush
looks
like
grease
that
the
style
scrub
it
hard
his
wife
joined
her
directions
to
his
then
it
was
over
here
and
over
there
now
in
that
corner
now
in
this
and
now
with
his
brush
and
soap
and
now
with
his
dry
rag
and
hurry
up
all
the
time
because
it
was
growing
late
but
the
little
boy
carried
away
by
the
interest
of
the
occasion
suddenly
broke
silence
for
the
first
time
crying
out
shrilly
his
mouth
full
of
bread
and
butter
hey
there
get
up
you
old
the
others
shouted
with
laughter
was
a
smart
little
boy
for
you
ah
he
be
a
man
before
his
mother
it
was
wonderful
how
that
boy
saw
everything
that
went
on
he
took
an
that
was
it
you
ought
to
see
he
watched
everything
and
sometimes
he
plump
out
with
things
that
were
astonishing
for
a
boy
of
his
years
only
four
and
a
half
too
and
they
reminded
each
other
of
the
first
day
he
put
on
knickerbockers
stood
in
front
of
the
house
on
the
sidewalk
all
day
long
with
his
hands
in
his
pockets
the
interest
was
directed
from
vandover
they
turned
their
backs
grouping
themselves
about
the
little
boy
the
burnisher
felt
called
upon
to
tell
about
her
little
girl
a
matter
of
family
pride
was
going
on
twelve
and
would
you
suppose
that
little
thing
was
in
next
to
the
last
grade
in
the
grammar
school
her
teacher
had
said
that
she
was
a
real
wonder
never
had
had
such
a
bright
pupil
ah
but
one
should
see
how
she
studied
over
her
books
all
the
time
next
year
they
were
to
try
to
get
her
into
the
high
school
of
course
she
was
not
ready
for
the
high
school
yet
and
it
was
against
the
rule
to
let
children
in
that
way
she
was
too
young
but
they
had
a
pull
you
understand
oh
yes
for
sure
they
had
a
pull
work
her
in
all
right
the
burnisher
wife
was
not
listening
she
wanted
to
draw
the
interest
back
to
her
own
little
boy
she
bent
down
and
straightened
out
his
little
jacket
saying
does
he
like
his
bread
butter
well
he
could
have
all
he
wanted
but
the
little
boy
paid
no
attention
to
her
he
had
made
a
ambition
stirred
in
him
he
had
tasted
the
delights
of
an
appreciative
audience
bread
and
butter
had
fallen
in
his
esteem
he
wished
to
repeat
his
former
success
and
cried
out
shriller
than
ever
hey
there
get
up
you
old
but
his
father
corrected
him
his
mother
ought
not
to
encourage
him
to
be
rude
that
not
right
oscar
he
observed
shaking
his
head
you
must
be
kind
to
the
poor
man
vandover
was
sitting
back
on
his
heels
to
rest
his
back
waiting
till
the
others
should
finish
well
all
through
inquired
the
burnisher
in
his
thin
voice
vandover
nodded
but
his
wife
was
not
satisfied
until
she
had
herself
carefully
peered
into
the
cubby
while
her
husband
held
a
lighted
match
for
her
ah
that
something
like
she
said
finally
it
was
nearly
seven
vandover
prepared
to
go
home
a
second
time
the
little
boy
stood
in
front
of
him
looking
down
at
him
as
he
made
his
brush
and
rags
and
broom
into
a
bundle
the
boy
slowly
eating
his
bread
and
butter
the
while
in
one
corner
of
the
room
an
excited
whispered
conference
was
going
on
between
the
burnisher
his
wife
and
his
fat
from
time
to
time
one
heard
such
expressions
as
overtime
you
know
not
afraid
of
work
ah
think
i
better
looks
as
though
he
needed
it
in
a
moment
the
two
women
went
out
calling
in
vain
for
the
little
boy
to
follow
and
the
burnisher
crossed
the
room
toward
vandover
vandover
was
on
his
knees
tying
up
his
bundle
with
a
bit
of
bale
rope
i
sorry
began
the
burnisher
awkwardly
we
did
mean
to
keep
you
from
your
supper
here
he
went
on
holding
out
a
quarter
to
vandover
here
you
take
this
that
all
right
you
worked
overtime
for
us
that
all
right
come
along
oscar
come
along
vandover
put
the
quarter
in
his
vest
pocket
thank
you
sir
he
said
the
burnisher
hurried
away
calling
back
come
along
do
keep
your
mama
waiting
for
supper
but
the
little
boy
remained
very
interested
in
watching
vandover
still
on
the
floor
tying
the
last
knots
as
he
finished
he
glanced
up
for
an
instant
the
two
remained
there
motionless
looking
into
each
other
eyes
vandover
on
the
floor
one
hand
twisted
into
the
bale
rope
about
his
bundle
the
little
boy
standing
before
him
eating
the
last
mouthful
of
his
bread
and
butter
