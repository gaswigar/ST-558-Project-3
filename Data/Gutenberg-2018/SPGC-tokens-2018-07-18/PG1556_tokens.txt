chapter
i
pro
and
con
monsieur
de
manerville
the
father
was
a
worthy
norman
gentleman
well
known
to
the
marechael
de
richelieu
who
married
him
to
one
of
the
richest
heiresses
of
bordeaux
in
the
days
when
the
old
duke
reigned
in
guienne
as
governor
the
norman
then
sold
the
estate
he
owned
in
bessin
and
became
a
gascon
allured
by
the
beauty
of
the
chateau
de
lanstrac
a
delightful
residence
owned
by
his
wife
during
the
last
days
of
the
reign
of
louis
he
bought
the
post
of
major
of
the
gate
guards
and
lived
till
having
by
great
good
luck
escaped
the
dangers
of
the
revolution
in
the
following
manner
toward
the
close
of
the
year
he
went
to
martinque
where
his
wife
had
interests
leaving
the
management
of
his
property
in
gascogne
to
an
honest
man
a
notary
s
clerk
named
mathias
who
was
inclined
to
or
at
any
rate
did
give
into
the
new
ideas
on
his
return
the
comte
de
manerville
found
his
possessions
intact
and
this
sound
result
was
the
fruit
produced
by
grafting
the
gascon
on
the
norman
madame
de
manerville
died
in
having
learned
the
importance
of
worldly
goods
through
the
dissipations
of
his
youth
and
giving
them
like
many
another
old
man
a
higher
place
than
they
really
hold
in
life
monsieur
de
manerville
became
increasingly
economical
miserly
and
sordid
without
reflecting
that
the
avarice
of
parents
prepares
the
way
for
the
prodigalities
of
children
he
allowed
almost
nothing
to
his
son
although
that
son
was
an
only
child
paul
de
manerville
coming
home
from
the
college
of
vendome
in
lived
under
close
paternal
discipline
for
three
years
the
tyranny
by
which
the
old
man
of
seventy
oppressed
his
heir
influenced
necessarily
a
heart
and
a
character
which
were
not
yet
formed
paul
the
son
without
lacking
the
physical
courage
which
is
vital
in
the
air
of
gascony
dared
not
struggle
against
his
father
and
consequently
lost
that
faculty
of
resistance
which
begets
moral
courage
his
thwarted
feelings
were
driven
to
the
depths
of
his
heart
where
they
remained
without
expression
later
when
he
felt
them
to
be
out
of
harmony
with
the
maxims
of
the
world
he
could
only
think
rightly
and
act
mistakenly
he
was
capable
of
fighting
for
a
mere
word
or
look
yet
he
trembled
at
the
thought
of
dismissing
a
servant
his
timidity
showing
itself
in
those
contests
only
which
required
a
persistent
will
capable
of
doing
great
things
to
fly
from
persecution
he
would
never
have
prevented
it
by
systematic
opposition
nor
have
faced
it
with
the
steady
employment
of
force
of
will
timid
in
thought
bold
in
actions
he
long
preserved
that
inward
simplicity
which
makes
a
man
the
dupe
and
the
voluntary
victim
of
things
against
which
certain
souls
hesitate
to
revolt
preferring
to
endure
them
rather
than
complain
he
was
in
point
of
fact
imprisoned
by
his
father
s
old
mansion
for
he
had
not
enough
money
to
consort
with
young
men
he
envied
their
pleasures
while
unable
to
share
them
the
old
gentleman
took
him
every
evening
in
an
old
carriage
drawn
by
old
horses
attended
by
old
servants
to
royalist
houses
where
he
met
a
society
composed
of
the
relics
of
the
parliamentary
nobility
and
the
martial
nobility
these
two
nobilities
coalescing
after
the
revolution
had
now
transformed
themselves
into
a
landed
aristocracy
crushed
by
the
vast
and
swelling
fortunes
of
the
maritime
cities
this
faubourg
of
bordeaux
responded
by
lofty
disdain
to
the
sumptuous
displays
of
commerce
government
administrations
and
the
military
too
young
to
understand
social
distinctions
and
the
necessities
underlying
the
apparent
assumption
which
they
create
paul
was
bored
to
death
among
these
ancients
unaware
that
the
connections
of
his
youth
would
eventually
secure
to
him
that
aristocratic
which
frenchmen
will
forever
desire
he
found
some
slight
compensations
for
the
dulness
of
these
evenings
in
certain
manual
exercises
which
always
delight
young
men
and
which
his
father
enjoined
upon
him
the
old
gentleman
considered
that
to
know
the
art
of
fencing
and
the
use
of
arms
to
ride
well
on
horseback
to
play
tennis
to
acquire
good
manners
in
short
to
possess
all
the
frivolous
accomplishments
of
the
old
nobility
made
a
young
man
of
the
present
day
a
finished
gentleman
accordingly
paul
took
a
every
morning
went
to
the
and
practised
in
a
the
rest
of
his
time
was
spent
in
reading
novels
for
his
father
would
never
have
allowed
the
more
abstruse
studies
now
considered
necessary
to
finish
an
education
so
monotonous
a
life
would
soon
have
killed
the
poor
youth
if
the
death
of
the
old
man
had
not
delivered
him
from
this
tyranny
at
the
moment
when
it
was
becoming
intolerable
paul
found
himself
in
possession
of
considerable
capital
accumulated
by
his
father
s
avarice
together
with
landed
estates
in
the
best
possible
condition
but
he
now
held
bordeaux
in
horror
neither
did
he
like
lanstrac
where
his
father
had
taken
him
to
spend
the
summers
employing
his
whole
time
from
morning
till
night
in
hunting
as
soon
as
the
estate
was
fairly
settled
the
young
heir
eager
for
enjoyment
bought
consols
with
his
capital
left
the
management
of
the
landed
property
to
old
mathias
his
father
s
notary
and
spent
the
next
six
years
away
from
bordeaux
at
first
he
was
attached
to
the
french
embassy
at
naples
after
that
he
was
secretary
of
legation
at
madrid
and
then
in
london
making
in
this
way
the
tour
of
europe
after
seeing
the
world
and
life
after
losing
several
illusions
after
dissipating
all
the
loose
capital
which
his
father
had
amassed
there
came
a
time
when
in
order
to
continue
his
way
of
life
paul
was
forced
to
draw
upon
the
territorial
revenues
which
his
notary
was
laying
by
at
this
critical
moment
seized
by
one
of
the
virtuous
impulses
he
determined
to
leave
paris
return
to
bordeaux
regulate
his
affairs
lead
the
life
of
a
country
gentleman
at
lanstrac
improve
his
property
marry
and
become
in
the
end
a
deputy
paul
was
a
count
nobility
was
once
more
of
matrimonial
value
he
could
and
he
ought
to
make
a
good
marriage
while
many
women
desire
a
title
many
others
like
to
marry
a
man
to
whom
a
knowledge
of
life
is
familiar
now
paul
had
acquired
in
exchange
for
the
sum
of
seven
hundred
thousand
francs
squandered
in
six
years
that
possession
which
can
not
be
bought
and
is
practically
of
more
value
than
gold
and
silver
a
knowledge
which
exacts
long
study
probation
examinations
friends
enemies
acquaintances
certain
manners
elegance
of
form
and
demeanor
a
graceful
and
euphonious
name
a
knowledge
moreover
which
means
many
duels
bets
lost
on
a
disillusions
deceptions
annoyances
toils
and
a
vast
variety
of
undigested
pleasures
in
short
he
had
become
what
is
called
elegant
but
in
spite
of
his
mad
extravagance
he
had
never
made
himself
a
mere
fashionable
man
in
the
burlesque
army
of
men
of
the
world
the
man
of
fashion
holds
the
place
of
a
marshal
of
france
the
man
of
elegance
is
the
equivalent
of
a
paul
enjoyed
his
lesser
reputation
of
elegance
and
knew
well
how
to
sustain
it
his
servants
were
his
equipages
were
cited
his
suppers
had
a
certain
vogue
in
short
his
bachelor
establishment
was
counted
among
the
seven
or
eight
whose
splendor
equalled
that
of
the
finest
houses
in
paris
but
he
had
not
caused
the
wretchedness
of
any
woman
he
gambled
without
losing
his
luck
was
not
notorious
he
was
far
too
upright
to
deceive
or
mislead
any
one
no
matter
who
even
a
wanton
never
did
he
leave
his
lying
about
and
he
possessed
no
coffer
or
desk
for
which
his
friends
were
at
liberty
to
read
while
he
tied
his
cravat
or
trimmed
his
beard
moreover
not
willing
to
dip
into
his
guienne
property
he
had
not
that
bold
extravagance
which
leads
to
great
strokes
and
calls
attention
at
any
cost
to
the
proceedings
of
a
young
man
neither
did
he
borrow
money
but
he
had
the
folly
to
lend
to
friends
who
then
deserted
him
and
spoke
of
him
no
more
either
for
good
or
evil
he
seemed
to
have
regulated
his
dissipations
methodically
the
secret
of
his
character
lay
in
his
father
s
tyranny
which
had
made
him
as
it
were
a
social
mongrel
so
one
morning
he
said
to
a
friend
named
de
marsay
who
afterwards
became
celebrated
my
dear
fellow
life
has
a
you
must
be
years
of
age
before
you
can
find
it
out
replied
de
marsay
laughing
well
i
am
and
precisely
because
i
am
i
mean
to
live
the
life
of
a
country
gentleman
at
lanstrac
i
ll
transport
my
belongings
to
bordeaux
into
my
father
s
old
mansion
and
i
ll
spend
three
months
of
the
year
in
paris
in
this
house
which
i
shall
will
you
marry
i
will
i
m
your
friend
as
you
know
my
old
paul
said
de
marsay
after
a
moment
s
silence
and
i
say
to
you
settle
down
into
a
worthy
father
and
husband
and
you
ll
be
ridiculous
for
the
rest
of
your
days
if
you
could
be
happy
and
ridiculous
the
thing
might
be
thought
of
but
you
will
not
be
happy
you
haven
t
a
strong
enough
wrist
to
drive
a
household
i
ll
do
you
justice
and
say
you
are
a
perfect
horseman
no
one
knows
as
well
as
you
how
to
pick
up
or
thrown
down
the
reins
and
make
a
horse
prance
and
sit
firm
to
the
saddle
but
my
dear
fellow
marriage
is
another
thing
i
see
you
now
led
along
at
a
slapping
pace
by
madame
la
comtesse
de
manerville
going
whither
you
would
not
oftener
at
a
gallop
than
a
trot
and
presently
unhorsed
yes
unhorsed
into
a
ditch
and
your
legs
broken
listen
to
me
you
still
have
some
thousand
francs
a
year
from
your
property
in
the
gironde
good
take
your
horses
and
servants
and
furnish
your
house
in
bordeaux
you
can
be
king
of
bordeaux
you
can
promulgate
there
the
edicts
that
we
put
forth
in
paris
you
can
be
the
correspondent
of
our
stupidities
very
good
play
the
rake
in
the
provinces
better
still
commit
follies
follies
may
win
you
celebrity
but
don
t
marry
who
marries
only
merchants
for
the
sake
of
their
capital
or
to
be
two
to
drag
the
cart
only
peasants
who
want
to
produce
children
to
work
for
them
only
brokers
and
notaries
who
want
a
wife
s
dot
to
pay
for
their
practice
only
miserable
kings
who
are
forced
to
continue
their
miserable
dynasties
but
we
are
exempt
from
the
pack
and
you
want
to
shoulder
it
and
why
do
you
want
to
marry
you
ought
to
give
your
best
friend
your
reasons
in
the
first
place
if
you
marry
an
heiress
as
rich
as
yourself
eighty
thousand
francs
a
year
for
two
is
not
the
same
thing
as
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
for
one
because
the
two
are
soon
three
or
four
when
the
children
come
you
haven
t
surely
any
love
for
that
silly
race
of
manerville
which
would
only
hamper
you
are
you
ignorant
of
what
a
father
and
mother
have
to
be
marriage
my
old
paul
is
the
silliest
of
all
the
social
immolations
our
children
alone
profit
by
it
and
don
t
know
its
price
until
their
horses
are
nibbling
the
flowers
on
our
grave
do
you
regret
your
father
that
old
tyrant
who
made
your
first
years
wretched
how
can
you
be
sure
that
your
children
will
love
you
the
very
care
you
take
of
their
education
your
precautions
for
their
happiness
your
necessary
sternness
will
lessen
their
affection
children
love
a
weak
or
a
prodigal
father
whom
they
will
despise
in
after
years
you
ll
live
betwixt
fear
and
contempt
no
man
is
a
good
head
of
a
family
merely
because
he
wants
to
be
look
round
on
all
our
friends
and
name
to
me
one
whom
you
would
like
to
have
for
a
son
we
have
known
a
good
many
who
dishonor
their
names
children
my
dear
paul
are
the
most
difficult
kind
of
merchandise
to
take
care
of
yours
you
think
will
be
angels
well
so
be
it
have
you
ever
sounded
the
gulf
which
lies
between
the
lives
of
a
bachelor
and
a
married
man
listen
as
a
bachelor
you
can
say
to
yourself
i
shall
never
exhibit
more
than
a
certain
amount
of
the
ridiculous
the
public
will
think
of
me
what
i
choose
it
to
married
you
ll
drop
into
the
infinitude
of
the
ridiculous
bachelor
you
can
make
your
own
happiness
you
enjoy
some
you
do
without
it
married
you
must
take
it
as
it
comes
and
the
day
you
want
it
you
will
have
to
go
without
it
marry
and
you
ll
grow
a
blockhead
you
ll
calculate
dowries
you
ll
talk
morality
public
and
religious
you
ll
think
young
men
immoral
and
dangerous
in
short
you
ll
become
a
social
academician
it
s
pitiable
the
old
bachelor
whose
property
the
heirs
are
waiting
for
who
fights
to
his
last
breath
with
his
nurse
for
a
spoonful
of
drink
is
blest
in
comparison
with
a
married
man
i
m
not
speaking
of
all
that
will
happen
to
annoy
bore
irritate
coerce
oppose
tyrannize
narcotize
paralyze
and
idiotize
a
man
in
marriage
in
that
struggle
of
two
beings
always
in
one
another
s
presence
bound
forever
who
have
coupled
each
other
under
the
strange
impression
that
they
were
suited
no
to
tell
you
those
things
would
be
merely
a
repetition
of
boileau
and
we
know
him
by
heart
still
i
ll
forgive
your
absurd
idea
if
you
will
promise
me
to
marry
en
grand
seigneur
to
entail
your
property
to
have
two
legitimate
children
to
give
your
wife
a
house
and
household
absolutely
distinct
from
yours
to
meet
her
only
in
society
and
never
to
return
from
a
journey
without
sending
her
a
courier
to
announce
it
two
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
will
suffice
for
such
a
life
and
your
antecedents
will
enable
you
to
marry
some
rich
english
woman
hungry
for
a
title
that
s
an
aristocratic
life
which
seems
to
me
thoroughly
french
the
only
life
in
which
we
can
retain
the
respect
and
friendship
of
a
woman
the
only
life
which
distinguishes
a
man
from
the
present
crowd
in
short
the
only
life
for
which
a
young
man
should
even
think
of
resigning
his
bachelor
blessings
thus
established
the
comte
de
manerville
may
advise
his
epoch
place
himself
above
the
world
and
be
nothing
less
than
a
minister
or
an
ambassador
ridicule
can
never
touch
him
he
has
gained
the
social
advantages
of
marriage
while
keeping
all
the
privileges
of
a
but
my
good
friend
i
am
not
de
marsay
i
am
plainly
as
you
yourself
do
me
the
honor
to
say
paul
de
manerville
worthy
father
and
husband
deputy
of
the
centre
possibly
peer
of
france
a
destiny
extremely
commonplace
but
i
am
modest
and
i
resign
yes
but
your
wife
said
the
pitiless
de
marsay
will
she
resign
herself
my
wife
my
dear
fellow
will
do
as
i
ah
my
poor
friend
is
that
where
you
are
adieu
paul
henceforth
i
refuse
to
respect
you
one
word
more
however
for
i
can
not
agree
coldly
to
your
abdication
look
and
see
in
what
the
strength
of
our
position
lies
a
bachelor
with
only
six
thousand
francs
a
year
remaining
to
him
has
at
least
his
reputation
for
elegance
and
the
memory
of
success
well
even
that
fantastic
shadow
has
enormous
value
in
it
life
still
offers
many
chances
to
the
unmarried
man
yes
he
can
aim
at
anything
but
marriage
paul
is
the
social
thus
far
shalt
thou
go
and
no
once
married
you
can
never
be
anything
but
what
you
then
are
unless
your
wife
should
deign
to
care
for
but
said
paul
you
are
crushing
me
down
with
exceptional
theories
i
am
tired
of
living
for
others
of
having
horses
merely
to
exhibit
them
of
doing
all
things
for
the
sake
of
what
may
be
said
of
them
of
wasting
my
substance
to
keep
fools
from
crying
out
dear
dear
paul
is
still
driving
the
same
carriage
what
has
he
done
with
his
fortune
does
he
squander
it
does
he
gamble
at
the
bourse
no
he
s
a
millionaire
madame
such
a
one
is
mad
about
him
he
sent
to
england
for
a
harness
which
is
certainly
the
handsomest
in
all
paris
the
equipages
of
messieurs
de
marsay
and
de
manerville
were
much
noticed
at
longchamps
the
harness
was
perfect
in
short
the
thousand
silly
things
with
which
a
crowd
of
idiots
lead
us
by
the
nose
believe
me
my
dear
henri
i
admire
your
power
but
i
don
t
envy
it
you
know
how
to
judge
of
life
you
think
and
act
as
a
statesman
you
are
able
to
place
yourself
above
all
ordinary
laws
received
ideas
adopted
conventions
and
acknowledged
prejudices
in
short
you
can
grasp
the
profits
of
a
situation
in
which
i
should
find
nothing
but
your
cool
systematic
possibly
true
deductions
are
to
the
eyes
of
the
masses
shockingly
immoral
i
belong
to
the
masses
i
must
play
my
game
of
life
according
to
the
rules
of
the
society
in
which
i
am
forced
to
live
while
putting
yourself
above
all
human
things
on
peaks
of
ice
you
still
have
feelings
but
as
for
me
i
should
freeze
to
death
the
life
of
that
great
majority
to
which
i
belong
in
my
commonplace
way
is
made
up
of
emotions
of
which
i
now
have
need
often
a
man
coquets
with
a
dozen
women
and
obtains
none
then
whatever
be
his
strength
his
cleverness
his
knowledge
of
the
world
he
undergoes
convulsions
in
which
he
is
crushed
as
between
two
gates
for
my
part
i
like
the
peaceful
chances
and
changes
of
life
i
want
that
wholesome
existence
in
which
we
find
a
woman
always
at
our
a
trifle
indecorous
your
marriage
exclaimed
de
marsay
paul
was
not
to
be
put
out
of
countenance
and
continued
laugh
if
you
like
i
shall
feel
myself
a
happy
man
when
my
valet
enters
my
room
in
the
morning
and
says
madame
is
awaiting
monsieur
for
breakfast
happier
still
at
night
when
i
return
to
find
a
heart
altogether
indecorous
my
dear
paul
you
are
not
yet
moral
enough
to
a
heart
in
which
to
confide
my
interests
and
my
secrets
i
wish
to
live
in
such
close
union
with
a
woman
that
our
affection
shall
not
depend
upon
a
yes
or
a
no
or
be
open
to
the
disillusions
of
love
in
short
i
have
the
necessary
courage
to
become
as
you
say
a
worthy
husband
and
father
i
feel
myself
fitted
for
family
joys
i
wish
to
put
myself
under
the
conditions
prescribed
by
society
i
desire
to
have
a
wife
and
you
remind
me
of
a
hive
of
but
go
your
way
you
ll
be
a
dupe
all
your
life
ha
ha
you
wish
to
marry
to
have
a
wife
in
other
words
you
wish
to
solve
satisfactorily
to
your
own
profit
the
most
difficult
problem
invented
by
those
bourgeois
morals
which
were
created
by
the
french
revolution
and
what
is
more
you
mean
to
begin
your
attempt
by
a
life
of
retirement
do
you
think
your
wife
won
t
crave
the
life
you
say
you
despise
will
be
disgusted
with
it
as
you
are
if
you
won
t
accept
the
noble
conjugality
just
formulated
for
your
benefit
by
your
friend
de
marsay
listen
at
any
rate
to
his
final
advice
remain
a
bachelor
for
the
next
thirteen
years
amuse
yourself
like
a
lost
soul
then
at
forty
on
your
first
attack
of
gout
marry
a
widow
of
then
you
may
possibly
be
happy
if
you
now
take
a
young
girl
to
wife
you
ll
die
a
ah
ca
tell
me
why
cried
paul
somewhat
piqued
my
dear
fellow
replied
de
marsay
boileau
s
satire
against
women
is
a
tissue
of
poetical
commonplaces
why
shouldn
t
women
have
defects
why
condemn
them
for
having
the
most
obvious
thing
in
human
nature
to
my
mind
the
problem
of
marriage
is
not
at
all
at
the
point
where
boileau
puts
it
do
you
suppose
that
marriage
is
the
same
thing
as
love
and
that
being
a
man
suffices
to
make
a
wife
love
you
have
you
gathered
nothing
in
your
boudoir
experience
but
pleasant
memories
i
tell
you
that
everything
in
our
bachelor
life
leads
to
fatal
errors
in
the
married
man
unless
he
is
a
profound
observer
of
the
human
heart
in
the
happy
days
of
his
youth
a
man
by
the
caprice
of
our
customs
is
always
lucky
he
triumphs
over
women
who
are
all
ready
to
be
triumphed
over
and
who
obey
their
own
desires
one
thing
after
another
the
obstacles
created
by
the
laws
the
sentiments
and
natural
defences
of
women
all
engender
a
mutuality
of
sensations
which
deceives
superficial
persons
as
to
their
future
relations
in
marriage
where
obstacles
no
longer
exist
where
the
wife
submits
to
love
instead
of
permitting
it
and
frequently
repulses
pleasure
instead
of
desiring
it
then
the
whole
aspect
of
a
man
s
life
changes
the
bachelor
who
is
free
and
without
a
care
need
never
fear
repulsion
in
marriage
repulsion
is
almost
certain
and
irreparable
it
may
be
possible
for
a
lover
to
make
a
woman
reverse
an
unfavorable
decision
but
such
a
change
my
dear
paul
is
the
waterloo
of
husbands
like
napoleon
the
husband
is
thenceforth
condemned
to
victories
which
in
spite
of
their
number
do
not
prevent
the
first
defeat
from
crushing
him
the
woman
so
flattered
by
the
perseverance
so
delighted
with
the
ardor
of
a
lover
calls
the
same
things
brutality
in
a
husband
you
who
talk
of
marrying
and
who
will
marry
have
you
ever
meditated
on
the
civil
code
i
myself
have
never
muddied
my
feet
in
that
hovel
of
commentators
that
garret
of
gossip
called
the
i
have
never
so
much
as
opened
the
code
but
i
see
its
application
on
the
vitals
of
society
the
code
my
dear
paul
makes
woman
a
ward
it
considers
her
a
child
a
minor
now
how
must
we
govern
children
by
fear
in
that
one
word
paul
is
the
curb
of
the
beast
now
feel
your
own
pulse
have
you
the
strength
to
play
the
tyrant
you
so
gentle
so
kind
a
friend
so
confiding
you
at
whom
i
have
laughed
but
whom
i
love
and
love
enough
to
reveal
to
you
my
science
for
this
is
science
yes
it
proceeds
from
a
science
which
the
germans
are
already
calling
anthropology
ah
if
i
had
not
already
solved
the
mystery
of
life
by
pleasure
if
i
had
not
a
profound
antipathy
for
those
who
think
instead
of
act
if
i
did
not
despise
the
ninnies
who
are
silly
enough
to
believe
in
the
truth
of
a
book
when
the
sands
of
the
african
deserts
are
made
of
the
ashes
of
i
know
not
how
many
unknown
and
pulverized
londons
romes
venices
and
parises
i
would
write
a
book
on
modern
marriages
made
under
the
influence
of
the
christian
system
and
i
d
stick
a
lantern
on
that
heap
of
sharp
stones
among
which
lie
the
votaries
of
the
social
but
the
question
is
does
humanity
require
even
an
hour
of
my
time
and
besides
isn
t
the
more
reasonable
use
of
ink
that
of
snaring
hearts
by
writing
well
shall
you
bring
the
comtesse
de
manerville
here
and
let
us
see
her
perhaps
said
paul
we
shall
still
be
friends
said
de
marsay
if
replied
paul
don
t
be
uneasy
we
will
treat
you
politely
as
treated
the
english
at
chapter
ii
the
pink
of
fashion
though
the
foregoing
conversation
affected
the
comte
de
manerville
somewhat
he
made
it
a
point
of
duty
to
carry
out
his
intentions
and
he
returned
to
bordeaux
during
the
winter
of
the
year
the
expenses
he
incurred
in
restoring
and
furnishing
his
family
mansion
sustained
the
reputation
for
elegance
which
had
preceded
him
introduced
through
his
former
connections
to
the
royalist
society
of
bordeaux
to
which
he
belonged
as
much
by
his
personal
opinions
as
by
his
name
and
fortune
he
soon
obtained
a
fashionable
his
knowledge
of
life
his
manners
his
parisian
acquirements
enchanted
the
faubourg
of
bordeaux
an
old
marquise
made
use
of
a
term
formerly
in
vogue
at
court
to
express
the
flowery
beauty
of
the
fops
and
beaux
of
the
olden
time
whose
language
and
demeanor
were
social
laws
she
called
him
the
pink
of
the
liberal
clique
caught
up
the
word
and
used
it
satirically
as
a
nickname
while
the
royalist
party
continued
to
employ
it
in
good
faith
paul
de
manerville
acquitted
himself
gloriously
of
the
obligations
imposed
by
his
flowery
title
it
happened
to
him
as
to
many
a
mediocre
actor
that
the
day
when
the
public
granted
him
their
full
attention
he
became
one
may
almost
say
superior
feeling
at
his
ease
he
displayed
the
fine
qualities
which
accompanied
his
defects
his
wit
had
nothing
sharp
or
bitter
in
it
his
manners
were
not
supercilious
his
intercourse
with
women
expressed
the
respect
they
like
it
was
neither
too
deferential
nor
too
familiar
his
foppery
went
no
farther
than
a
care
for
his
personal
appearance
which
made
him
agreeable
he
showed
consideration
for
rank
he
allowed
young
men
a
certain
freedom
to
which
his
parisian
experience
assigned
due
limits
though
skilful
with
sword
and
pistol
he
was
noted
for
a
feminine
gentleness
for
which
others
were
grateful
his
medium
height
and
plumpness
which
had
not
yet
increased
into
obesity
an
obstacle
to
personal
elegance
did
not
prevent
his
outer
man
from
playing
the
part
of
a
bordelais
brummell
a
white
skin
tinged
with
the
hues
of
health
handsome
hands
and
feet
blue
eyes
with
long
lashes
black
hair
graceful
motions
a
chest
voice
which
kept
to
its
middle
tones
and
vibrated
in
the
listener
s
heart
harmonized
well
with
his
sobriquet
paul
was
indeed
that
delicate
flower
which
needs
such
careful
culture
the
qualities
of
which
display
themselves
only
in
a
moist
and
suitable
soil
a
flower
which
rough
treatment
dwarfs
which
the
hot
sun
burns
and
a
frost
lays
low
he
was
one
of
those
men
made
to
receive
happiness
rather
than
to
give
it
who
have
something
of
the
woman
in
their
nature
wishing
to
be
divined
understood
encouraged
in
short
a
man
to
whom
conjugal
love
ought
to
come
as
a
providence
if
such
a
character
creates
difficulties
in
private
life
it
is
gracious
and
full
of
attraction
for
the
world
consequently
paul
had
great
success
in
the
narrow
social
circle
of
the
provinces
where
his
mind
always
so
to
speak
in
was
better
appreciated
than
in
paris
the
arrangement
of
his
house
and
the
restoration
of
the
chateau
de
lanstrac
where
he
introduced
the
comfort
and
luxury
of
an
english
absorbed
the
capital
saved
by
the
notary
during
the
preceding
six
years
reduced
now
to
his
strict
income
of
thousand
a
year
he
thought
himself
wise
and
prudent
in
so
regulating
his
household
as
not
to
exceed
it
after
publicly
exhibiting
his
equipages
entertaining
the
most
distinguished
young
men
of
the
place
and
giving
various
hunting
parties
on
the
estate
at
lanstrac
paul
saw
very
plainly
that
provincial
life
would
never
do
without
marriage
too
young
to
employ
his
time
in
miserly
occupations
or
in
trying
to
interest
himself
in
the
speculative
improvements
in
which
provincials
sooner
or
later
engage
compelled
thereto
by
the
necessity
of
establishing
their
children
he
soon
felt
the
need
of
that
variety
of
distractions
a
habit
of
which
becomes
at
last
the
very
life
of
a
parisian
a
name
to
preserve
property
to
transmit
to
heirs
social
relations
to
be
created
by
a
household
where
the
principal
families
of
the
neighborhood
could
assemble
and
a
weariness
of
all
irregular
connections
were
not
however
the
determining
reasons
of
his
matrimonial
desires
from
the
time
he
first
returned
to
the
provinces
he
had
been
secretly
in
love
with
the
queen
of
bordeaux
the
great
beauty
mademoiselle
evangelista
about
the
beginning
of
the
century
a
rich
spaniard
named
evangelista
established
himself
in
bordeaux
where
his
letters
of
recommendation
as
well
as
his
large
fortune
gave
him
an
entrance
to
the
salons
of
the
nobility
his
wife
contributed
greatly
to
maintain
him
in
the
good
graces
of
an
aristocracy
which
may
perhaps
have
adopted
him
in
the
first
instance
merely
to
pique
the
society
of
the
class
below
them
madame
evangelista
who
belonged
to
the
an
illustrious
family
of
spain
was
a
creole
and
like
all
women
served
by
slaves
she
lived
as
a
great
lady
knew
nothing
of
the
value
of
money
repressed
no
whims
even
the
most
expensive
finding
them
ever
satisfied
by
an
adoring
husband
who
generously
concealed
from
her
knowledge
the
of
the
financial
machine
happy
in
finding
her
pleased
with
bordeaux
where
his
interests
obliged
him
to
live
the
spaniard
bought
a
house
set
up
a
household
received
in
much
style
and
gave
many
proofs
of
possessing
a
fine
taste
in
all
things
thus
from
to
monsieur
and
madame
evangelista
were
objects
of
great
interest
to
the
community
of
bordeaux
the
spaniard
died
in
leaving
his
wife
a
widow
at
years
of
age
with
an
immense
fortune
and
the
prettiest
little
girl
in
the
world
a
child
of
eleven
who
promised
to
be
and
did
actually
become
a
most
accomplished
young
woman
clever
as
madame
evangelista
was
the
restoration
altered
her
position
the
royalist
party
cleared
its
ranks
and
several
of
the
old
families
left
bordeaux
though
the
head
and
hand
of
her
husband
were
lacking
in
the
direction
of
her
affairs
for
which
she
had
hitherto
shown
the
indifference
of
a
creole
and
the
inaptitude
of
a
lackadaisical
woman
she
was
determined
to
make
no
change
in
her
manner
of
living
at
the
period
when
paul
resolved
to
return
to
his
native
town
mademoiselle
natalie
evangelista
was
a
remarkably
beautiful
young
girl
and
apparently
the
richest
match
in
bordeaux
where
the
steady
diminution
of
her
mother
s
capital
was
unknown
in
order
to
prolong
her
reign
madame
evangelista
had
squandered
enormous
sums
brilliant
fetes
and
the
continuation
of
an
almost
regal
style
of
living
kept
the
public
in
its
past
belief
as
to
the
wealth
of
the
spanish
family
natalie
was
now
in
her
nineteenth
year
but
no
proposal
of
marriage
had
as
yet
reached
her
mother
s
ear
accustomed
to
gratify
her
fancies
mademoiselle
evangelista
wore
cashmeres
and
jewels
and
lived
in
a
style
of
luxury
which
alarmed
all
speculative
suitors
in
a
region
and
at
a
period
when
sons
were
as
calculating
as
their
parents
the
fatal
remark
none
but
a
prince
can
afford
to
marry
mademoiselle
evangelista
circulated
among
the
salons
and
the
cliques
mothers
of
families
dowagers
who
had
granddaughters
to
establish
young
girls
jealous
of
natalie
whose
elegance
and
tyrannical
beauty
annoyed
them
took
pains
to
envenom
this
opinion
with
treacherous
remarks
when
they
heard
a
possible
suitor
say
with
ecstatic
admiration
as
natalie
entered
a
heavens
how
beautiful
she
is
yes
the
mammas
would
answer
but
if
some
thought
mademoiselle
evangelista
bewitching
and
said
to
a
marriageable
man
that
he
couldn
t
do
it
better
who
would
be
bold
enough
some
woman
would
reply
to
marry
a
girl
whose
mother
gives
her
a
thousand
francs
a
month
for
her
toilet
a
girl
who
has
horses
and
a
maid
of
her
own
and
wears
laces
yes
her
peignoirs
are
trimmed
with
mechlin
the
price
of
her
washing
would
support
the
household
of
a
clerk
she
wears
pelerines
in
the
morning
which
actually
cost
six
francs
to
get
these
and
other
speeches
said
occasionally
in
the
form
of
praise
extinguished
the
desires
that
some
men
might
have
had
to
marry
the
beautiful
spanish
girl
queen
of
every
ball
accustomed
to
flattery
blasee
with
the
smiles
and
the
admiration
which
followed
her
every
step
natalie
nevertheless
knew
nothing
of
life
she
lived
as
the
bird
which
flies
as
the
flower
that
blooms
finding
every
one
about
her
eager
to
do
her
will
she
was
ignorant
of
the
price
of
things
she
knew
neither
the
value
of
money
nor
whence
it
came
how
it
should
be
managed
and
how
spent
possibly
she
thought
that
every
household
had
cooks
and
coachmen
lady
and
footmen
as
the
fields
have
hay
and
the
trees
their
fruits
to
her
beggars
and
paupers
fallen
trees
and
waste
lands
seemed
in
the
same
category
pampered
and
petted
as
her
mother
s
hope
no
fatigue
was
allowed
to
spoil
her
pleasure
thus
she
bounded
through
life
as
a
courser
on
his
steppe
unbridled
and
unshod
six
month
s
after
paul
s
arrival
the
pink
of
fashion
and
the
queen
of
balls
met
in
presence
of
the
highest
society
of
the
town
of
bordeaux
the
two
flowers
looked
at
each
other
with
apparent
coldness
and
mutually
thought
each
other
charming
interested
in
watching
the
effects
of
the
meeting
madame
evangelista
divined
in
the
expression
of
paul
s
eyes
the
feelings
within
him
and
she
muttered
to
herself
he
will
be
my
paul
on
the
other
hand
said
to
himself
as
he
looked
at
natalie
she
will
be
my
the
wealth
of
the
evangelistas
proverbial
in
bordeaux
had
remained
in
paul
s
mind
as
a
memory
of
his
childhood
thus
the
pecuniary
conditions
were
known
to
him
from
the
start
without
necessitating
those
discussions
and
inquiries
which
are
as
repugnant
to
a
timid
mind
as
to
a
proud
one
when
some
persons
attempting
to
say
to
paul
a
few
flattering
phrases
as
to
natalie
s
manner
language
and
beauty
ending
by
remarks
cruelly
calculated
to
deter
him
on
the
lavish
extravagance
of
the
evangelistas
the
pink
of
fashion
replied
with
a
disdain
that
was
by
such
provincial
pettiness
this
method
of
receiving
such
speeches
soon
silenced
them
for
he
now
set
the
tone
to
the
ideas
and
language
as
well
as
to
the
manners
of
those
about
him
he
had
imported
from
his
travels
a
certain
development
of
the
britannic
personality
with
its
icy
barriers
also
a
tone
of
byronic
pessimism
as
to
life
together
with
english
plate
ponies
yellow
gloves
cigars
and
the
habit
of
galloping
it
thus
happened
that
paul
escaped
the
discouragements
hitherto
presented
to
marriageable
men
by
dowagers
and
young
girls
madame
evangelista
began
by
asking
him
to
formal
dinners
on
various
occasions
the
pink
of
fashion
would
not
of
course
miss
festivities
to
which
none
but
the
most
distinguished
young
men
of
the
town
were
bidden
in
spite
of
the
coldness
that
paul
assumed
which
deceived
neither
mother
nor
daughter
he
was
drawn
step
by
step
into
the
path
of
marriage
sometimes
as
he
passed
in
his
tilbury
or
rode
by
on
his
fine
english
horse
he
heard
the
young
men
of
his
acquaintance
say
to
one
another
there
s
a
lucky
man
he
is
rich
and
handsome
and
is
to
marry
so
they
say
mademoiselle
evangelista
there
are
some
men
for
whom
the
world
seems
when
he
met
the
evangelistas
he
felt
proud
of
the
particular
distinction
which
mother
and
daughter
imparted
to
their
bows
if
paul
had
not
secretly
within
his
heart
fallen
in
love
with
mademoiselle
natalie
society
would
certainly
have
married
him
to
her
in
spite
of
himself
society
which
never
causes
good
is
the
accomplice
of
much
evil
then
when
it
beholds
the
evil
it
has
hatched
maternally
it
rejects
and
revenges
it
society
in
bordeaux
attributing
a
dot
of
a
million
to
mademoiselle
evangelista
bestowed
it
upon
paul
without
awaiting
the
consent
of
either
party
their
fortunes
so
it
was
said
agreed
as
well
as
their
persons
paul
had
the
same
habits
of
luxury
and
elegance
in
the
midst
of
which
natalie
had
been
brought
up
he
had
just
arranged
for
himself
a
house
such
as
no
other
man
in
bordeaux
could
have
offered
her
accustomed
to
parisian
expenses
and
the
caprices
of
parisian
women
he
alone
was
fitted
to
meet
the
pecuniary
difficulties
which
were
likely
to
follow
this
marriage
with
a
girl
who
was
as
much
of
a
creole
and
a
great
lady
as
her
mother
where
they
themselves
remarked
the
marriageable
men
would
have
been
ruined
the
comte
de
manerville
rich
as
he
was
could
evade
disaster
in
short
the
marriage
was
made
persons
in
the
highest
royalist
circles
said
a
few
engaging
words
to
paul
which
flattered
his
vanity
every
one
gives
you
mademoiselle
evangelista
if
you
marry
her
you
will
do
well
you
could
not
find
even
in
paris
a
more
delightful
girl
she
is
beautiful
graceful
elegant
and
takes
after
the
through
her
mother
you
will
make
a
charming
couple
you
have
the
same
tastes
the
same
desires
in
life
and
you
will
certainly
have
the
most
agreeable
house
in
bordeaux
your
wife
need
only
bring
her
all
is
ready
for
her
you
are
fortunate
indeed
in
such
a
a
woman
of
intelligence
and
very
adroit
she
will
be
a
great
help
to
you
in
public
life
to
which
you
ought
to
aspire
besides
she
has
sacrificed
everything
to
her
daughter
whom
she
adores
and
natalie
will
no
doubt
prove
a
good
wife
for
she
loves
her
mother
you
must
soon
bring
the
matter
to
a
that
is
all
very
well
replied
paul
who
in
spite
of
his
love
was
desirous
of
keeping
his
freedom
of
action
but
i
must
be
sure
that
the
conclusion
shall
be
a
happy
he
now
went
frequently
to
madame
evangelista
s
partly
to
occupy
his
vacant
hours
which
were
harder
for
him
to
employ
than
for
most
men
there
alone
he
breathed
the
atmosphere
of
grandeur
and
luxury
to
which
he
was
accustomed
at
forty
years
of
age
madame
evangelista
was
beautiful
with
the
beauty
of
those
glorious
summer
sunsets
which
crown
a
cloudless
day
her
spotless
reputation
had
given
an
endless
topic
of
conversation
to
the
bordeaux
cliques
the
curiosity
of
the
women
was
all
the
more
lively
because
the
widow
gave
signs
of
the
temperament
which
makes
a
spanish
woman
and
a
creole
particularly
noted
she
had
black
eyes
and
hair
the
feet
and
form
of
a
spanish
woman
that
swaying
form
the
movements
of
which
have
a
name
in
spain
her
face
still
beautiful
was
particularly
seductive
for
its
creole
complexion
the
vividness
of
which
can
be
described
only
by
comparing
it
to
muslin
overlying
crimson
so
equally
is
the
whiteness
suffused
with
color
her
figure
which
was
full
and
rounded
attracted
the
eye
by
a
grace
which
united
nonchalance
with
vivacity
strength
with
ease
she
attracted
and
she
imposed
she
seduced
but
promised
nothing
she
was
tall
which
gave
her
at
times
the
air
and
carriage
of
a
queen
men
were
taken
by
her
conversation
like
birds
in
a
snare
for
she
had
by
nature
that
genius
which
necessity
bestows
on
schemes
she
advanced
from
concession
to
concession
strengthening
herself
with
what
she
gained
to
ask
for
more
knowing
well
how
to
retreat
with
rapid
steps
when
concessions
were
demanded
in
return
though
ignorant
of
facts
she
had
known
the
courts
of
spain
and
naples
the
celebrated
men
of
the
two
americas
many
illustrious
families
of
england
and
the
continent
all
of
which
gave
her
so
extensive
an
education
superficially
that
it
seemed
immense
she
received
her
society
with
the
grace
and
dignity
which
are
never
learned
but
which
come
to
certain
naturally
fine
spirits
like
a
second
nature
assimilating
choice
things
wherever
they
are
met
if
her
reputation
for
virtue
was
unexplained
it
gave
at
any
rate
much
authority
to
her
actions
her
conversation
and
her
character
mother
and
daughter
had
a
true
friendship
for
each
other
beyond
the
filial
and
maternal
sentiment
they
suited
one
another
and
their
perpetual
contact
had
never
produced
the
slightest
jar
consequently
many
persons
explained
madame
evangelista
s
actions
by
maternal
love
but
although
natalie
consoled
her
mother
s
persistent
widowhood
she
may
not
have
been
the
only
motive
for
it
madame
evangelista
had
been
it
was
said
in
love
with
a
man
who
recovered
his
titles
and
property
under
the
restoration
this
man
desirous
of
marrying
her
in
had
discreetly
severed
the
connection
in
madame
evangelista
to
all
appearance
the
woman
in
the
world
had
in
the
depths
of
her
nature
a
fearful
quality
explainable
only
by
catherine
de
medici
s
device
odiate
e
aspettate
hate
and
accustomed
to
rule
having
always
been
obeyed
she
was
like
other
royalties
amiable
gentle
easy
and
pleasant
in
ordinary
life
but
terrible
implacable
if
the
pride
of
the
woman
the
spaniard
and
the
was
touched
she
never
forgave
this
woman
believed
in
the
power
of
her
hatred
she
made
an
evil
fate
of
it
and
bade
it
hover
above
her
enemy
this
fatal
power
she
employed
against
the
man
who
had
jilted
her
events
which
seemed
to
prove
the
influence
of
her
jettatura
the
casting
of
an
evil
eye
confirmed
her
superstitious
faith
in
herself
though
a
minister
and
peer
of
france
this
man
began
to
ruin
himself
and
soon
came
to
total
ruin
his
property
his
personal
and
public
honor
were
doomed
to
perish
at
this
crisis
madame
evangelista
in
her
brilliant
equipage
passed
her
faithless
lover
walking
on
foot
in
the
champes
elysees
and
crushed
him
with
a
look
which
flamed
with
triumph
this
misadventure
which
occupied
her
mind
for
two
years
was
the
original
cause
of
her
not
remarrying
later
her
pride
had
drawn
comparisons
between
the
suitors
who
presented
themselves
and
the
husband
who
had
loved
her
so
sincerely
and
so
well
she
had
thus
reached
through
mistaken
calculations
and
disappointed
hopes
that
period
of
life
when
women
have
no
other
part
to
take
in
life
than
that
of
mother
a
part
which
involves
the
sacrifice
of
themselves
to
their
children
the
placing
of
their
interests
outside
of
self
upon
another
household
the
last
refuge
of
human
affections
madame
evangelista
divined
paul
s
nature
intuitively
and
hid
her
own
from
his
perception
paul
was
the
very
man
she
desired
for
a
for
the
responsible
editor
of
her
future
power
he
belonged
through
his
mother
to
the
family
of
maulincour
and
the
old
baronne
de
maulincour
the
friend
of
the
vidame
de
pamiers
was
then
living
in
the
centre
of
the
faubourg
the
grandson
of
the
baroness
auguste
de
maulincour
held
a
fine
position
in
the
army
paul
would
therefore
be
an
excellent
introducer
for
the
evangelistas
into
parisian
society
the
widow
had
known
something
of
the
paris
of
the
empire
she
now
desired
to
shine
in
the
paris
of
the
restoration
there
alone
were
the
elements
of
political
fortune
the
only
business
in
which
women
of
the
world
could
decently
madame
evangelista
compelled
by
her
husband
s
affairs
to
reside
in
bordeaux
disliked
the
place
she
desired
a
wider
field
as
gamblers
rush
to
higher
stakes
for
her
own
personal
ends
therefore
she
looked
to
paul
as
a
means
of
destiny
she
proposed
to
employ
the
resources
of
her
own
talent
and
knowledge
of
life
to
advance
her
in
order
to
enjoy
through
him
the
delights
of
power
many
men
are
thus
made
the
screens
of
secret
feminine
ambitions
madame
evangelista
had
however
more
than
one
interest
as
we
shall
see
in
laying
hold
of
her
daughter
s
husband
paul
was
naturally
captivated
by
this
woman
who
charmed
him
all
the
more
because
she
seemed
to
seek
no
influence
over
him
in
reality
she
was
using
her
ascendancy
to
magnify
herself
her
daughter
and
all
her
surroundings
in
his
eyes
for
the
purpose
of
ruling
from
the
start
the
man
in
whom
she
saw
a
means
of
gratifying
her
social
longings
paul
on
the
other
hand
began
to
value
himself
more
highly
when
he
felt
himself
appreciated
by
the
mother
and
daughter
he
thought
himself
much
cleverer
than
he
really
was
when
he
found
his
reflections
and
sayings
accepted
and
understood
by
mademoiselle
natalie
who
raised
her
head
and
smiled
in
response
to
them
and
by
the
mother
whose
flattery
always
seemed
involuntary
the
two
women
were
so
kind
and
friendly
to
him
he
was
so
sure
of
pleasing
them
they
ruled
him
so
delightfully
by
holding
the
thread
of
his
that
he
soon
passed
all
his
time
at
the
hotel
evangelista
a
year
after
his
return
to
bordeaux
comte
paul
without
having
declared
himself
was
so
attentive
to
natalie
that
the
world
considered
him
as
courting
her
neither
mother
nor
daughter
appeared
to
be
thinking
of
marriage
mademoiselle
evangelista
preserved
towards
paul
the
reserve
of
a
great
lady
who
can
make
herself
charming
and
converse
agreeably
without
permitting
a
single
step
into
intimacy
this
reserve
so
little
customary
among
provincials
pleased
paul
immensely
timid
men
are
shy
sudden
proposals
alarm
them
they
retreat
from
happiness
when
it
comes
with
a
rush
and
accept
misfortune
if
it
presents
itself
mildly
with
gentle
shadows
paul
therefore
committed
himself
in
his
own
mind
all
the
more
because
he
saw
no
effort
on
madame
evangelista
s
part
to
bind
him
she
fairly
seduced
him
one
evening
by
remarking
that
to
superior
women
as
well
as
men
there
came
a
period
of
life
when
ambition
superseded
all
the
earlier
emotions
of
life
that
woman
is
fitted
thought
paul
as
he
left
her
to
advance
me
in
diplomacy
before
i
am
even
made
a
if
in
all
the
circumstances
of
life
a
man
does
not
turn
over
and
over
both
things
and
ideas
in
order
to
examine
them
thoroughly
under
their
different
aspects
before
taking
action
that
man
is
weak
and
incomplete
and
in
danger
of
fatal
failure
at
this
moment
paul
was
an
optimist
he
saw
everything
to
advantage
and
did
not
tell
himself
than
an
ambitious
might
prove
a
tyrant
so
every
evening
as
he
left
the
house
he
fancied
himself
a
married
man
allured
his
mind
with
its
own
thought
and
slipped
on
the
slippers
of
wedlock
cheerfully
in
the
first
place
he
had
enjoyed
his
freedom
too
long
to
regret
the
loss
of
it
he
was
tired
of
a
bachelor
s
life
which
offered
him
nothing
new
he
now
saw
only
its
annoyances
whereas
if
he
thought
at
times
of
the
difficulties
of
marriage
its
pleasures
in
which
lay
novelty
came
far
more
prominently
before
his
mind
marriage
he
said
to
himself
is
disagreeable
for
people
without
means
but
half
its
troubles
disappear
before
every
day
some
favorable
consideration
swelled
the
advantages
which
he
now
saw
in
this
particular
alliance
no
matter
to
what
position
i
attain
natalie
will
always
be
on
the
level
of
her
part
thought
he
and
that
is
no
small
merit
in
a
woman
how
many
of
the
empire
men
i
ve
seen
who
suffered
horribly
through
their
wives
it
is
a
great
condition
of
happiness
not
to
feel
one
s
pride
or
one
s
vanity
wounded
by
the
companion
we
have
chosen
a
man
can
never
be
really
unhappy
with
a
wife
she
will
never
make
him
ridiculous
such
a
woman
is
certain
to
be
useful
to
him
natalie
will
receive
in
her
own
house
so
thinking
he
taxed
his
memory
as
to
the
most
distinguished
women
of
the
faubourg
in
order
to
convince
himself
that
natalie
could
if
not
eclipse
them
at
any
rate
stand
among
them
on
a
footing
of
perfect
equality
all
comparisons
were
to
her
advantage
for
they
rested
on
his
own
imagination
which
followed
his
desires
paris
would
have
shown
him
daily
other
natures
young
girls
of
other
styles
of
beauty
and
charm
and
the
multiplicity
of
impressions
would
have
balanced
his
mind
whereas
in
bordeaux
natalie
had
no
rivals
she
was
the
solitary
flower
moreover
she
appeared
to
him
at
a
moment
when
paul
was
under
the
tyranny
of
an
idea
to
which
most
men
succumb
at
his
age
thus
these
reasons
of
propinquity
joined
to
reasons
of
and
a
real
passion
which
had
no
means
of
satisfaction
except
by
marriage
led
paul
on
to
an
irrational
love
which
he
had
however
the
good
sense
to
keep
to
himself
he
even
endeavored
to
study
mademoiselle
evangelista
as
a
man
should
who
desires
not
to
compromise
his
future
life
for
the
words
of
his
friend
de
marsay
did
sometimes
rumble
in
his
ears
like
a
warning
but
in
the
first
place
persons
accustomed
to
luxury
have
a
certain
indifference
to
it
which
misleads
them
they
despise
it
they
use
it
it
is
an
instrument
and
not
the
object
of
their
existence
paul
never
imagined
as
he
observed
the
habits
of
life
of
the
two
ladies
that
they
covered
a
gulf
of
ruin
then
though
there
may
exist
some
general
rules
to
soften
the
asperities
of
marriage
there
are
none
by
which
they
can
be
accurately
foreseen
and
evaded
when
trouble
arises
between
two
persons
who
have
undertaken
to
render
life
agreeable
and
easy
to
each
other
it
comes
from
the
contact
of
continual
intimacy
which
of
course
does
not
exist
between
young
people
before
they
marry
and
will
never
exist
so
long
as
our
present
social
laws
and
customs
prevail
in
france
all
is
more
or
less
deception
between
the
two
young
persons
about
to
take
each
other
for
life
an
innocent
and
involuntary
deception
it
is
true
each
endeavors
to
appear
in
a
favorable
light
both
take
a
tone
and
attitude
conveying
a
more
favorable
idea
of
their
nature
than
they
are
able
to
maintain
in
after
years
real
life
like
the
weather
is
made
up
of
gray
and
cloudy
days
alternating
with
those
when
the
sun
shines
and
the
fields
are
gay
young
people
however
exhibit
fine
weather
and
no
clouds
later
they
attribute
to
marriage
the
evils
inherent
in
life
itself
for
there
is
in
man
a
disposition
to
lay
the
blame
of
his
own
misery
on
the
persons
and
things
that
surround
him
to
discover
in
the
demeanor
or
the
countenance
or
the
words
or
the
gestures
of
mademoiselle
evangelista
any
indication
that
revealed
the
imperfections
of
her
character
paul
must
have
possessed
not
only
the
knowledge
of
lavater
and
gall
but
also
a
science
in
which
there
exists
no
formula
of
doctrine
the
individual
and
personal
science
of
an
observer
which
for
its
perfection
requires
an
almost
universal
knowledge
natalie
s
face
like
that
of
most
young
girls
was
impenetrable
the
deep
serene
peace
given
by
sculptors
to
the
virgin
faces
of
justice
and
innocence
divinities
aloof
from
all
earthly
agitations
is
the
greatest
charm
of
a
young
girl
the
sign
of
her
purity
nothing
as
yet
has
stirred
her
no
shattered
passion
no
hope
betrayed
has
clouded
the
placid
expression
of
that
pure
face
is
that
expression
assumed
if
so
there
is
no
young
girl
behind
it
natalie
closely
held
to
the
heart
of
her
mother
had
received
like
other
spanish
women
an
education
that
was
solely
religious
together
with
a
few
instructions
from
her
mother
as
to
the
part
in
life
she
was
called
upon
to
play
consequently
the
calm
untroubled
expression
of
her
face
was
natural
and
yet
it
formed
a
casing
in
which
the
woman
was
wrapped
as
the
moth
in
its
cocoon
nevertheless
any
man
clever
at
handling
the
scalpel
of
analysis
might
have
detected
in
natalie
certain
indications
of
the
difficulties
her
character
would
present
when
brought
into
contact
with
conjugal
or
social
life
her
beauty
which
was
really
marvellous
came
from
extreme
regularity
of
feature
harmonizing
with
the
proportions
of
the
head
and
the
body
this
species
of
perfection
augurs
ill
for
the
mind
and
there
are
few
exceptions
to
the
rule
all
superior
nature
is
found
to
have
certain
slight
imperfections
of
form
which
become
irresistible
attractions
luminous
points
from
which
shine
vivid
sentiments
and
on
which
the
eye
rests
gladly
perfect
harmony
expresses
usually
the
coldness
of
a
mixed
organization
natalie
s
waist
was
round
a
sign
of
strength
but
also
the
infallible
indication
of
a
will
which
becomes
obstinacy
in
persons
whose
mind
is
neither
keen
nor
broad
her
hands
like
those
of
a
greek
statue
confirmed
the
predictions
of
face
and
figure
by
revealing
an
inclination
for
illogical
domination
of
willing
for
will
s
sake
only
her
eyebrows
met
a
sign
according
to
some
observers
which
indicates
jealousy
the
jealousy
of
superior
minds
becomes
emulation
and
leads
to
great
things
that
of
small
minds
turns
to
hatred
the
hate
and
wait
of
her
mother
was
in
her
nature
without
disguise
her
eyes
were
black
apparently
though
really
brown
with
orange
streaks
contrasting
with
her
hair
of
the
ruddy
tint
so
prized
by
the
romans
called
auburn
in
england
a
color
which
often
appears
in
the
offspring
of
persons
of
jet
black
hair
like
that
of
monsieur
and
madame
evangelista
the
whiteness
and
delicacy
of
natalie
s
complexion
gave
to
the
contrast
of
color
in
her
eyes
and
hair
an
inexpressible
charm
and
yet
it
was
a
charm
that
was
purely
external
for
whenever
the
lines
of
a
face
are
lacking
in
a
certain
soft
roundness
whatever
may
be
the
finish
and
grace
of
the
details
the
beauty
therein
expressed
is
not
of
the
soul
these
roses
of
deceptive
youth
will
drop
their
leaves
and
you
will
be
surprised
in
a
few
years
to
see
hardness
and
dryness
where
you
once
admired
what
seemed
to
be
the
beauty
of
noble
qualities
though
the
outlines
of
natalie
s
face
had
something
august
about
them
her
chin
was
slightly
empate
a
painter
s
expression
which
will
serve
to
show
the
existence
of
sentiments
the
violence
of
which
would
only
become
manifest
in
after
life
her
mouth
a
trifle
drawn
in
expressed
a
haughty
pride
in
keeping
with
her
hand
her
chin
her
brows
and
her
beautiful
figure
and
as
a
last
diagnostic
to
guide
the
judgment
of
a
connoisseur
natalie
s
pure
voice
a
most
seductive
voice
had
certain
metallic
tones
softly
as
that
brassy
ring
was
managed
and
in
spite
of
the
grace
with
which
its
sounds
ran
through
the
compass
of
the
voice
that
organ
revealed
the
character
of
the
duke
of
alba
from
whom
the
were
collaterally
descended
these
indications
were
those
of
violent
passions
without
tenderness
sudden
devotions
irreconcilable
dislikes
a
mind
without
intelligence
and
the
desire
to
rule
natural
to
persons
who
feel
themselves
inferior
to
their
pretensions
these
defects
born
of
temperament
and
constitution
were
buried
in
natalie
like
ore
in
a
mine
and
would
only
appear
under
the
shocks
and
harsh
treatment
to
which
all
characters
are
subjected
in
this
world
meantime
the
grace
and
freshness
of
her
youth
the
distinction
of
her
manners
her
sacred
ignorance
and
the
sweetness
of
a
young
girl
gave
a
delicate
glamour
to
her
features
which
could
not
fail
to
mislead
an
unthinking
or
superficial
mind
her
mother
had
early
taught
her
the
trick
of
agreeable
talk
which
appears
to
imply
superiority
replying
to
arguments
by
clever
jests
and
attracting
by
the
graceful
volubility
beneath
which
a
woman
hides
the
subsoil
of
her
mind
as
nature
disguises
her
barren
strata
beneath
a
wealth
of
ephemeral
vegetation
natalie
had
the
charm
of
children
who
have
never
known
what
it
is
to
suffer
she
charmed
by
her
frankness
and
had
none
of
that
solemn
air
which
mothers
impose
on
their
daughters
by
laying
down
a
programme
of
behavior
and
language
until
the
time
comes
when
they
marry
and
are
emancipated
she
was
gay
and
natural
like
any
young
girl
who
knows
nothing
of
marriage
expects
only
pleasure
from
it
replies
to
all
objections
with
a
jest
foresees
no
troubles
and
thinks
she
is
acquiring
the
right
to
have
her
own
way
how
could
paul
who
loved
as
men
love
when
desire
increases
love
perceive
in
a
girl
of
this
nature
whose
beauty
dazzled
him
the
woman
such
as
she
would
probably
be
at
thirty
when
observers
themselves
have
been
misled
by
these
appearances
besides
if
happiness
might
prove
difficult
to
find
in
a
marriage
with
such
a
girl
it
was
not
impossible
through
these
embryo
defects
shone
several
fine
qualities
there
is
no
good
quality
which
if
properly
developed
by
the
hand
of
an
able
master
will
not
stifle
defects
especially
in
a
young
girl
who
loves
him
but
to
render
ductile
so
intractable
a
woman
the
iron
wrist
about
which
de
marsay
had
preached
to
paul
was
needful
the
parisian
dandy
was
right
fear
inspired
by
love
is
an
infallible
instrument
by
which
to
manage
the
minds
of
women
whoso
loves
fears
whoso
fears
is
nearer
to
affection
than
to
hatred
had
paul
the
coolness
firmness
and
judgment
required
for
this
struggle
which
an
able
husband
ought
not
to
let
the
wife
suspect
did
natalie
love
paul
like
most
young
girls
natalie
mistook
for
love
the
first
emotions
of
instinct
and
the
pleasure
she
felt
in
paul
s
external
appearance
but
she
knew
nothing
of
the
things
of
marriage
nor
the
demands
of
a
home
to
her
the
comte
de
manerville
a
rising
diplomatist
to
whom
the
courts
of
europe
were
known
and
one
of
the
most
elegant
young
men
in
paris
could
not
seem
what
perhaps
he
was
an
ordinary
man
without
moral
force
timid
though
brave
in
some
ways
energetic
perhaps
in
adversity
but
helpless
against
the
vexations
and
annoyances
that
hinder
happiness
would
she
in
after
years
have
sufficient
tact
and
insight
to
distinguish
paul
s
noble
qualities
in
the
midst
of
his
minor
defects
would
she
not
magnify
the
latter
and
forget
the
former
after
the
manner
of
young
wives
who
know
nothing
of
life
there
comes
a
time
when
wives
will
pardon
defects
in
the
husband
who
spares
her
annoyances
considering
annoyances
in
the
same
category
as
misfortunes
what
conciliating
power
what
wise
experience
would
uphold
and
enlighten
the
home
of
this
young
pair
paul
and
his
wife
would
doubtless
think
they
loved
when
they
had
really
not
advanced
beyond
the
endearments
and
compliments
of
the
honeymoon
would
paul
in
that
early
period
yield
to
the
tyranny
of
his
wife
instead
of
establishing
his
empire
could
paul
say
no
all
was
peril
to
a
man
so
weak
where
even
a
strong
man
ran
some
risks
the
subject
of
this
study
is
not
the
transition
of
a
bachelor
into
a
married
man
a
picture
which
if
broadly
composed
would
not
lack
the
attraction
which
the
inner
struggles
of
our
nature
and
feelings
give
to
the
commonest
situations
in
life
the
events
and
the
ideas
which
led
to
the
marriage
of
paul
with
natalie
evangelista
are
an
introduction
to
our
real
subject
which
is
to
sketch
the
great
comedy
that
precedes
in
france
all
conjugal
pairing
this
scene
until
now
singularly
neglected
by
our
dramatic
authors
although
it
offers
novel
resources
to
their
wit
controlled
paul
s
future
life
and
was
now
awaited
by
madame
evangelista
with
feelings
of
terror
we
mean
the
discussion
which
takes
place
on
the
subject
of
the
marriage
contract
in
all
families
whether
noble
or
bourgeois
for
human
passions
are
as
keenly
excited
by
small
interests
as
by
large
ones
these
comedies
played
before
a
notary
all
resemble
more
or
less
the
one
we
shall
now
relate
the
interest
of
which
will
be
far
less
in
the
pages
of
this
book
than
in
the
memories
of
married
persons
chapter
iii
the
marriage
contract
first
day
at
the
beginning
of
the
winter
of
paul
de
manerville
made
a
formal
request
through
his
the
baronne
de
maulincour
for
the
hand
of
mademoiselle
natalie
evangelista
though
the
baroness
never
stayed
more
than
two
months
in
medoc
she
remained
on
this
occasion
till
the
last
of
october
in
order
to
assist
her
nephew
through
the
affair
and
play
the
part
of
a
mother
to
him
after
conveying
the
first
suggestions
to
madame
evangelista
the
experienced
old
woman
returned
to
inform
paul
of
the
results
of
the
overture
my
child
she
said
the
affair
is
won
in
talking
of
property
i
found
that
madame
evangelista
gives
nothing
of
her
own
to
her
daughter
mademoiselle
natalie
s
dowry
is
her
patrimony
marry
her
my
dear
boy
men
who
have
a
name
and
an
estate
to
transmit
a
family
to
continue
must
sooner
or
later
end
in
marriage
i
wish
i
could
see
my
dear
auguste
taking
that
course
you
can
now
carry
on
the
marriage
without
me
i
have
nothing
to
give
you
but
my
blessing
and
women
as
old
as
i
are
out
of
place
at
a
wedding
i
leave
for
paris
when
you
present
your
wife
in
society
i
shall
be
able
to
see
her
and
assist
her
far
more
to
the
purpose
than
now
if
you
had
had
no
house
in
paris
i
would
gladly
have
arranged
the
second
floor
of
mine
for
dear
aunt
said
paul
i
thank
you
heartily
but
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
that
the
mother
gives
nothing
of
her
own
and
that
the
daughter
s
dowry
is
her
patrimony
the
mother
my
dear
boy
is
a
sly
cat
who
takes
advantage
of
her
daughter
s
beauty
to
impose
conditions
and
allow
you
only
that
which
she
can
not
prevent
you
from
having
namely
the
daughter
s
fortune
from
her
father
we
old
people
know
the
importance
of
inquiring
closely
what
has
he
what
has
she
i
advise
you
therefore
to
give
particular
instructions
to
your
notary
the
marriage
contract
my
dear
child
is
the
most
sacred
of
all
duties
if
your
father
and
your
mother
had
not
made
their
bed
properly
you
might
now
be
sleeping
without
sheets
you
will
have
children
they
are
the
commonest
result
of
marriage
and
you
must
think
of
them
consult
maitre
mathias
our
old
madame
de
maulincour
departed
having
plunged
paul
into
a
state
of
extreme
perplexity
his
a
sly
cat
must
he
struggle
for
his
interests
in
the
marriage
contract
was
it
necessary
to
defend
them
who
was
likely
to
attack
them
he
followed
the
advice
of
his
aunt
and
confided
the
of
the
marriage
contract
to
maitre
mathias
but
these
threatened
discussions
oppressed
him
and
he
went
to
see
madame
evangelista
and
announce
his
intentions
in
a
state
of
rather
lively
agitation
like
all
timid
men
he
shrank
from
allowing
the
distrust
his
aunt
had
put
into
his
mind
to
be
seen
in
fact
he
considered
it
insulting
to
avoid
even
a
slight
jar
with
a
person
so
imposing
to
his
mind
as
his
future
he
proceeded
to
state
his
intentions
with
the
circumlocution
natural
to
persons
who
dare
not
face
a
difficulty
madame
he
said
choosing
a
moment
when
natalie
was
absent
from
the
room
you
know
of
course
what
a
family
notary
is
mine
is
a
worthy
old
man
to
whom
it
would
be
a
sincere
grief
if
he
were
not
entrusted
with
the
drawing
of
my
marriage
why
of
course
said
madame
evangelista
interrupting
him
but
are
not
marriage
contracts
always
made
by
agreement
of
the
notaries
of
both
families
the
time
that
paul
took
to
reply
to
this
question
was
occupied
by
madame
evangelista
in
asking
herself
what
is
he
thinking
of
for
women
possess
in
an
eminent
degree
the
art
of
reading
thoughts
from
the
play
of
countenance
she
divined
the
instigations
of
the
in
the
embarrassed
glance
and
the
agitated
tone
of
voice
which
betrayed
an
inward
struggle
in
paul
s
mind
at
last
she
thought
to
herself
the
fatal
day
has
come
the
crisis
begins
how
will
it
end
my
notary
is
monsieur
solonet
she
said
after
a
pause
yours
i
think
you
said
is
monsieur
mathias
i
will
invite
them
to
dinner
and
they
can
come
to
an
understanding
then
it
is
their
business
to
conciliate
our
interests
without
our
interference
just
as
good
cooks
are
expected
to
furnish
good
food
without
yes
you
are
right
said
paul
letting
a
faint
sigh
of
relief
escape
from
him
by
a
singular
transposition
of
parts
paul
innocent
of
all
trembled
while
madame
evangelista
though
a
prey
to
the
utmost
anxiety
was
outwardly
calm
the
widow
owed
her
daughter
of
the
fortune
left
by
monsieur
evangelista
namely
nearly
twelve
hundred
thousand
francs
and
she
knew
herself
unable
to
pay
it
even
by
taking
the
whole
of
her
property
to
do
so
she
would
therefore
be
placed
at
the
mercy
of
a
though
she
might
be
able
to
control
paul
if
left
to
himself
would
he
when
enlightened
by
his
notary
agree
to
release
her
from
rendering
her
account
as
guardian
of
her
daughter
s
patrimony
if
paul
withdrew
his
proposals
all
bordeaux
would
know
the
reason
and
natalie
s
future
marriage
would
be
made
impossible
this
mother
who
desired
the
happiness
of
her
daughter
this
woman
who
from
infancy
had
lived
honorably
was
aware
that
on
the
morrow
she
must
become
dishonest
like
those
great
warriors
who
fain
would
blot
from
their
lives
the
moment
when
they
had
felt
a
secret
cowardice
she
ardently
desired
to
cut
this
inevitable
day
from
the
record
of
hers
most
assuredly
some
hairs
on
her
head
must
have
whitened
during
the
night
when
face
to
face
with
facts
she
bitterly
regretted
her
extravagance
as
she
felt
the
hard
necessities
of
the
situation
among
these
necessities
was
that
of
confiding
the
truth
to
her
notary
for
whom
she
sent
in
the
morning
as
soon
as
she
rose
she
was
forced
to
reveal
to
him
a
secret
defaulting
she
had
never
been
willing
to
admit
to
herself
for
she
had
steadily
advanced
to
the
abyss
relying
on
some
chance
accident
which
never
happened
to
relieve
her
there
rose
in
her
soul
a
feeling
against
paul
that
was
neither
dislike
nor
aversion
nor
anything
as
yet
unkind
but
he
was
the
cause
of
this
crisis
the
opposing
party
in
this
secret
suit
he
became
without
knowing
it
an
innocent
enemy
she
was
forced
to
conquer
what
human
being
did
ever
yet
love
his
or
her
dupe
compelled
to
deceive
and
trick
him
if
she
could
the
spanish
woman
resolved
like
other
women
to
put
her
whole
force
of
character
into
the
struggle
the
dishonor
of
which
could
be
absolved
by
victory
only
in
the
stillness
of
the
night
she
excused
her
conduct
to
her
own
mind
by
a
tissue
of
arguments
in
which
her
pride
predominated
natalie
had
shared
the
benefit
of
her
extravagance
there
was
not
a
single
base
or
ignoble
motive
in
what
she
had
done
she
was
no
accountant
but
was
that
a
crime
a
delinquency
a
man
was
only
too
lucky
to
obtain
a
wife
like
natalie
without
a
penny
such
a
treasure
bestowed
upon
him
might
surely
release
her
from
a
guardianship
account
how
many
men
had
bought
the
women
they
loved
by
greater
sacrifices
why
should
a
man
do
less
for
a
wife
than
for
a
mistress
besides
paul
was
a
nullity
a
man
of
no
force
incapable
she
would
spend
the
best
resources
of
her
mind
upon
him
and
open
to
him
a
fine
career
he
should
owe
his
future
power
and
position
to
her
influence
in
that
way
she
could
pay
her
debt
he
would
indeed
be
a
fool
to
refuse
such
a
future
and
for
what
a
few
paltry
thousands
more
or
less
he
would
be
infamous
if
he
withdrew
for
such
a
reason
but
she
added
to
herself
if
the
negotiation
does
not
succeed
at
once
i
shall
leave
bordeaux
i
can
still
find
a
good
marriage
for
natalie
by
investing
the
proceeds
of
what
is
left
house
and
diamonds
and
furniture
keeping
only
a
small
income
for
when
a
strong
soul
constructs
a
way
of
ultimate
escape
as
richelieu
did
at
brouage
and
holds
in
reserve
a
vigorous
end
the
resolution
becomes
a
lever
which
strengthens
its
immediate
way
the
thought
of
this
finale
in
case
of
failure
comforted
madame
evangelista
who
fell
asleep
with
all
the
more
confidence
as
she
remembered
her
assistance
in
the
coming
duel
this
was
a
young
man
named
solonet
considered
the
ablest
notary
in
bordeaux
now
years
of
age
and
decorated
with
the
legion
of
honor
for
having
actively
contributed
to
the
second
return
of
the
bourbons
proud
and
happy
to
be
received
in
the
home
of
madame
evangelista
less
as
a
notary
than
as
belonging
to
the
royalist
society
of
bordeaux
solonet
had
conceived
for
that
fine
setting
sun
one
of
those
passions
which
women
like
madame
evangelista
repulse
although
flattered
and
graciously
allowing
them
to
exist
upon
the
surface
solonet
remained
therefore
in
a
condition
of
hope
and
becoming
respect
being
sent
for
he
arrived
the
next
morning
with
the
promptitude
of
a
slave
and
was
received
by
the
coquettish
widow
in
her
bedroom
where
she
allowed
him
to
find
her
in
a
very
becoming
dishabille
can
i
she
said
count
upon
your
discretion
and
your
entire
devotion
in
a
discussion
which
will
take
place
in
my
house
this
evening
you
will
readily
understand
that
it
relates
to
the
marriage
of
my
the
young
man
expended
himself
in
gallant
protestations
now
to
the
point
she
said
i
am
listening
he
replied
checking
his
ardor
madame
evangelista
then
stated
her
position
baldly
my
dear
lady
that
is
nothing
to
be
troubled
about
said
maitre
solonet
assuming
a
confident
air
as
soon
as
his
client
had
given
him
the
exact
figures
the
question
is
how
have
you
conducted
yourself
toward
monsieur
de
manerville
in
this
matter
questions
of
manner
and
deportment
are
of
greater
importance
than
those
of
law
and
madame
evangelista
wrapped
herself
in
dignity
the
notary
learned
to
his
satisfaction
that
until
the
present
moment
his
client
s
relations
to
paul
had
been
distant
and
reserved
and
that
partly
from
native
pride
and
partly
from
involuntary
shrewdness
she
had
treated
the
comte
de
manerville
as
in
some
sense
her
inferior
and
as
though
it
were
an
honor
for
him
to
be
allowed
to
marry
mademoiselle
evangelista
she
assured
solonet
that
neither
she
nor
her
daughter
could
be
suspected
of
any
mercenary
interests
in
the
marriage
that
they
had
the
right
should
paul
make
any
financial
difficulties
to
retreat
from
the
affair
to
an
illimitable
distance
and
finally
that
she
had
already
acquired
over
her
future
a
very
remarkable
ascendancy
if
that
is
so
said
solonet
tell
me
what
are
the
utmost
concessions
you
are
willing
to
i
wish
to
make
as
few
as
possible
she
answered
laughing
a
woman
s
answer
cried
solonet
madame
are
you
anxious
to
marry
mademoiselle
natalie
and
you
want
a
receipt
for
the
eleven
hundred
and
thousand
francs
for
which
you
are
responsible
on
the
guardianship
account
which
the
law
obliges
you
to
render
to
your
how
much
do
you
want
to
keep
back
thirty
thousand
a
year
at
it
is
a
question
of
conquer
or
die
is
it
it
well
then
i
must
reflect
on
the
necessary
means
to
that
end
it
will
need
all
our
cleverness
to
manage
our
forces
i
will
give
you
some
instructions
on
my
arrival
this
evening
follow
them
carefully
and
i
think
i
may
promise
you
a
successful
issue
is
the
comte
de
manerville
in
love
with
mademoiselle
natalie
he
asked
as
he
rose
to
take
leave
he
adores
that
is
not
enough
does
he
desire
her
to
the
point
of
disregarding
all
pecuniary
difficulties
that
s
what
i
call
having
a
lien
upon
a
daughter
s
property
cried
the
notary
make
her
look
her
best
he
added
with
a
sly
glance
she
has
a
most
charming
dress
for
the
the
dress
is
in
my
opinion
half
the
battle
said
solonet
this
last
argument
seemed
so
cogent
to
madame
evangelista
that
she
superintended
natalie
s
toilet
herself
as
much
perhaps
to
watch
her
daughter
as
to
make
her
the
innocent
accomplice
of
her
financial
conspiracy
with
her
hair
dressed
a
la
sevigne
and
wearing
a
gown
of
white
tulle
adorned
with
pink
ribbons
natalie
seemed
to
her
mother
so
beautiful
as
to
guarantee
victory
when
the
lady
left
the
room
and
madame
evangelista
was
certain
that
no
one
could
overhear
her
she
arranged
a
few
curls
on
her
daughter
s
head
by
way
of
exordium
dear
child
she
said
in
a
voice
that
was
firm
apparently
do
you
sincerely
love
the
comte
de
manerville
mother
and
daughter
cast
strange
looks
at
each
other
why
do
you
ask
that
question
little
mother
and
more
than
yesterday
why
have
you
thrown
me
with
him
if
you
and
i
had
to
part
forever
would
you
still
persist
in
the
marriage
i
should
give
it
up
and
i
should
not
die
of
you
do
not
love
him
my
dear
said
the
mother
kissing
her
daughter
s
forehead
but
why
my
dear
mother
are
you
playing
the
grand
inquisitor
i
wished
to
know
if
you
desired
the
marriage
without
being
madly
in
love
with
the
i
love
and
you
are
right
he
is
a
count
we
will
make
him
a
peer
of
france
between
us
nevertheless
there
are
certain
difficulties
between
persons
who
love
each
other
oh
no
the
heart
of
the
pink
of
fashion
is
too
firmly
planted
here
she
said
with
a
pretty
gesture
to
make
the
very
slightest
objection
i
am
sure
of
but
suppose
it
were
otherwise
persisted
madame
evangelista
he
would
be
profoundly
and
forever
forgotten
replied
natalie
good
you
are
a
but
suppose
though
he
madly
loves
you
suppose
certain
discussions
and
difficulties
should
arise
not
of
his
own
making
but
which
he
must
decide
in
your
interests
as
well
as
in
mine
hey
natalie
what
then
without
lowering
your
dignity
perhaps
a
little
softness
in
your
manner
might
decide
him
a
word
a
tone
a
mere
nothing
men
are
so
made
they
resist
a
serious
argument
but
they
yield
to
a
tender
i
understand
a
little
touch
to
make
my
favori
leap
the
barrier
said
natalie
making
the
gesture
of
striking
a
horse
with
her
whip
my
darling
i
ask
nothing
that
resembles
seduction
you
and
i
have
sentiments
of
the
old
castilian
honor
which
will
never
permit
us
to
pass
certain
limits
count
paul
shall
know
our
what
situation
you
would
not
understand
it
but
i
tell
you
now
that
if
after
seeing
you
in
all
your
glory
his
look
betrays
the
slightest
hesitation
and
i
shall
watch
him
on
that
instant
i
shall
break
off
the
marriage
i
will
liquidate
my
property
leave
bordeaux
and
go
to
douai
to
be
near
the
claes
madame
claes
is
our
relation
through
the
temnincks
then
i
ll
marry
you
to
a
peer
of
france
and
take
refuge
in
a
convent
myself
that
i
may
give
up
to
you
my
whole
mother
what
am
i
to
do
to
prevent
such
misfortunes
cried
natalie
i
have
never
seen
you
so
beautiful
as
you
are
now
replied
her
mother
be
a
little
coquettish
and
all
is
madame
evangelista
left
natalie
to
her
thoughts
and
went
to
arrange
her
own
toilet
in
such
a
way
that
would
bear
comparison
with
that
of
her
daughter
if
natalie
ought
to
make
herself
attractive
to
paul
she
ought
none
the
less
to
inflame
the
ardor
of
her
champion
solonet
the
mother
and
daughter
were
therefore
under
arms
when
paul
arrived
bearing
the
bouquet
which
for
the
last
few
months
he
had
daily
offered
to
his
love
all
three
conversed
pleasantly
while
awaiting
the
arrival
of
the
notaries
this
day
brought
to
paul
the
first
skirmish
of
that
long
and
wearisome
warfare
called
marriage
it
is
therefore
necessary
to
state
the
forces
on
both
sides
the
position
of
the
belligerent
bodies
and
the
ground
on
which
they
are
about
to
manoeuvre
to
maintain
a
struggle
the
importance
of
which
had
wholly
escaped
him
paul
s
only
auxiliary
was
the
old
notary
mathias
both
were
about
to
be
confronted
unaware
and
defenceless
by
a
most
unexpected
circumstance
to
be
pressed
by
an
enemy
whose
strategy
was
planned
and
driven
to
decide
on
a
course
without
having
time
to
reflect
upon
it
where
is
the
man
who
would
not
have
succumbed
even
though
assisted
by
cujas
and
barthole
how
should
he
look
for
deceit
and
treachery
where
all
seemed
compliant
and
natural
what
could
old
mathias
do
alone
against
madame
evangelista
against
solonet
against
natalie
especially
when
a
client
in
love
goes
over
to
the
enemy
as
soon
as
the
rising
conflict
threatens
his
happiness
already
paul
was
damaging
his
cause
by
making
the
customary
lover
s
speeches
to
which
his
passion
gave
excessive
value
in
the
ears
of
madame
evangelista
whose
object
it
was
to
drive
him
to
commit
himself
the
matrimonial
condottieri
now
about
to
fight
for
their
clients
whose
personal
powers
were
to
be
so
vitally
important
in
this
solemn
encounter
the
two
notaries
on
short
represent
individually
the
old
and
the
new
systems
old
fashioned
notarial
usage
and
the
modern
procedure
maitre
mathias
was
a
worthy
old
gentleman
years
of
age
who
took
great
pride
in
his
forty
years
exercise
of
the
profession
his
huge
gouty
feet
were
encased
in
shoes
with
silver
buckles
making
a
ridiculous
termination
to
legs
so
spindling
with
knees
so
bony
that
when
he
crossed
them
they
made
you
think
of
the
emblems
on
a
tombstone
his
puny
little
thighs
lost
in
a
pair
of
wide
black
breeches
fastened
with
buckles
seemed
to
bend
beneath
the
weight
of
a
round
stomach
and
a
torso
developed
like
that
of
most
sedentary
persons
into
a
stout
barrel
always
buttoned
into
a
green
coat
with
square
tails
which
no
man
could
remember
to
have
ever
seen
new
his
hair
well
brushed
and
powdered
was
tied
in
a
rat
s
tail
that
lay
between
the
collar
of
his
coat
and
that
of
his
waistcoat
which
was
white
with
a
pattern
of
flowers
with
his
round
head
his
face
the
color
of
a
his
blue
eyes
a
trumpet
nose
a
mouth
and
a
the
dear
old
fellow
excited
whenever
he
appeared
among
strangers
who
did
not
know
him
that
satirical
laugh
which
frenchmen
so
generously
bestow
on
the
ludicrous
creations
dame
nature
occasionally
allows
herself
which
art
delights
in
exaggerating
under
the
name
of
caricatures
but
in
maitre
mathias
mind
had
triumphed
over
form
the
qualities
of
his
soul
had
vanquished
the
oddities
of
his
body
the
inhabitants
of
bordeaux
as
a
rule
testified
a
friendly
respect
and
a
deference
that
was
full
of
esteem
for
him
the
old
man
s
voice
went
to
their
hearts
and
sounded
there
with
the
eloquence
of
uprightness
his
craft
consisted
in
going
straight
to
the
fact
overturning
all
subterfuge
and
evil
devices
by
plain
questionings
his
quick
perception
his
long
training
in
his
profession
gave
him
that
divining
sense
which
goes
to
the
depths
of
conscience
and
reads
its
secret
thoughts
though
grave
and
deliberate
in
business
the
patriarch
could
be
gay
with
the
gaiety
of
our
ancestors
he
could
risk
a
song
after
dinner
enjoy
all
family
festivities
celebrate
the
birthdays
of
grandmothers
and
children
and
bury
with
due
solemnity
the
christmas
log
he
loved
to
send
presents
at
new
year
and
eggs
at
easter
he
believed
in
the
duties
of
a
godfather
and
never
deserted
the
customs
which
colored
the
life
of
the
olden
time
maitre
mathias
was
a
noble
and
venerable
relic
of
the
notaries
obscure
great
men
who
gave
no
receipt
for
the
millions
entrusted
to
them
but
returned
those
millions
in
the
sacks
they
were
delivered
in
tied
with
the
same
twine
men
who
fulfilled
their
trusts
to
the
letter
drew
honest
inventories
took
fatherly
interest
in
their
clients
often
barring
the
way
to
extravagance
and
dissipation
men
to
whom
families
confided
their
secrets
and
who
felt
so
responsible
for
any
error
in
their
deeds
that
they
meditated
long
and
carefully
over
them
never
during
his
whole
notarial
life
had
any
client
found
reason
to
complain
of
a
bad
investment
or
an
mortgage
his
own
fortune
slowly
but
honorably
acquired
had
come
to
him
as
the
result
of
a
thirty
years
practice
and
careful
economy
he
had
established
in
life
fourteen
of
his
clerks
religious
and
generous
in
secret
mathias
was
found
whenever
good
was
to
be
done
without
remuneration
an
active
member
on
hospital
and
other
benevolent
committees
he
subscribed
the
largest
sums
to
relieve
all
sudden
misfortunes
and
emergencies
as
well
as
to
create
certain
useful
permanent
institutions
consequently
neither
he
nor
his
wife
kept
a
carriage
also
his
word
was
felt
to
be
sacred
and
his
coffers
held
as
much
of
the
money
of
others
as
a
bank
and
also
we
may
add
he
went
by
the
name
of
our
good
monsieur
mathias
and
when
he
died
three
thousand
persons
followed
him
to
his
grave
solonet
was
the
style
of
young
notary
who
comes
in
humming
a
tune
affects
declares
that
business
is
better
done
with
a
laugh
than
seriously
he
is
the
notary
captain
of
the
national
guard
who
dislikes
to
be
taken
for
a
notary
solicits
the
cross
of
the
legion
of
honor
keeps
his
cabriolet
and
leaves
the
verification
of
his
deeds
to
his
clerks
he
is
the
notary
who
goes
to
balls
and
theatres
buys
pictures
and
plays
at
ecarte
he
has
coffers
in
which
gold
is
received
on
deposit
and
is
later
returned
in
a
notary
who
follows
his
epoch
risks
capital
in
doubtful
investments
speculates
with
all
he
can
lay
his
hands
on
and
expects
to
retire
with
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
after
ten
years
practice
in
short
the
notary
whose
cleverness
comes
of
his
duplicity
whom
many
men
fear
as
an
accomplice
possessing
their
secrets
and
who
sees
in
his
practice
a
means
of
ultimately
marrying
some
heiress
when
the
slender
solonet
curled
perfumed
and
booted
like
the
leading
gentleman
at
the
vaudeville
and
dressed
like
a
dandy
whose
most
important
business
is
a
duel
entered
madame
evangelista
s
salon
preceding
his
brother
notary
whose
advance
was
delayed
by
a
twinge
of
the
gout
the
two
men
presented
to
the
life
one
of
those
famous
caricatures
entitled
former
times
and
the
present
day
which
had
such
eminent
success
under
the
empire
if
madame
and
mademoiselle
evangelista
to
whom
the
good
monsieur
mathias
was
personally
unknown
felt
on
first
seeing
him
a
slight
inclination
to
laugh
they
were
soon
touched
by
the
grace
with
which
he
greeted
them
the
words
he
used
were
full
of
that
amenity
which
amiable
old
men
convey
as
much
by
the
ideas
they
suggest
as
by
the
manner
in
which
they
express
them
the
younger
notary
with
his
flippant
tone
seemed
on
a
lower
plane
mathias
showed
his
superior
knowledge
of
life
by
the
reserved
manner
with
which
he
accosted
paul
without
compromising
his
white
hairs
he
showed
that
he
respected
the
young
man
s
nobility
while
at
the
same
time
he
claimed
the
honor
due
to
old
age
and
made
it
felt
that
social
rights
are
natural
solonet
s
bow
and
greeting
on
the
contrary
expressed
a
sense
of
perfect
equality
which
would
naturally
affront
the
pretensions
of
a
man
of
society
and
make
the
notary
ridiculous
in
the
eyes
of
a
real
noble
solonet
made
a
motion
somewhat
too
familiar
to
madame
evangelista
inviting
her
to
a
private
conference
in
the
recess
of
a
window
for
some
minutes
they
talked
to
each
other
in
a
low
voice
giving
way
now
and
then
to
laughter
no
doubt
to
lessen
in
the
minds
of
others
the
importance
of
the
conversation
in
which
solonet
was
really
communicating
to
his
sovereign
lady
the
plan
of
battle
but
he
said
as
he
ended
will
you
have
the
courage
to
sell
your
house
undoubtedly
she
replied
madame
evangelista
did
not
choose
to
tell
her
notary
the
motive
of
this
heroism
which
struck
him
greatly
solonet
s
zeal
might
have
cooled
had
he
known
that
his
client
was
really
intending
to
leave
bordeaux
she
had
not
as
yet
said
anything
about
that
intention
to
paul
in
order
not
to
alarm
him
with
the
preliminary
steps
and
circumlocutions
which
must
be
taken
before
he
entered
on
the
political
life
she
planned
for
him
after
dinner
the
two
plenipotentiaries
left
the
loving
pair
with
the
mother
and
betook
themselves
to
an
adjoining
salon
where
their
conference
was
arranged
to
take
place
a
dual
scene
then
followed
on
this
domestic
stage
in
the
of
the
great
salon
a
scene
of
love
in
which
to
all
appearances
life
was
smiles
and
joy
in
the
other
room
a
scene
of
gravity
and
gloom
where
selfish
interests
baldly
proclaimed
openly
took
the
part
they
play
in
life
under
flowery
disguises
my
dear
master
said
solonet
the
document
can
remain
under
your
lock
and
key
i
know
very
well
what
i
owe
to
my
old
mathias
bowed
gravely
but
continued
solonet
unfolding
the
rough
copy
of
a
deed
he
had
made
his
clerk
draw
up
as
we
are
the
oppressed
party
i
mean
the
daughter
i
have
written
the

solonet
our

the
of
which
i
hold
are
derived
from
our
father
and
mother
except
the
house
in
paris
which
we
bought
ourselves
we
must
also
reckon
in
the
furniture
of
the
two

if

let
us
see
your

and
tell
us
what
you
bring
and
what
your

will
secure
to

monsieur
le
comte
de
manerville
love
mademoiselle
evangelista
he
wishes
to
make
her
his
wife
if
the
marriage
can
be
suitably
arranged
said
the
old
notary
i
am
not
a
child
this
matter
concerns
our
business
and
not
our
the
marriage
will
be
off
unless
you
show
generous
feeling
and
for
this
reason
continued
solonet
no
inventory
was
made
at
the
death
of
our
husband
we
are
spaniards
creoles
and
know
nothing
of
french
laws
besides
we
were
too
deeply
grieved
at
our
loss
to
think
at
such
a
time
of
the
miserable
formalities
which
occupy
cold
hearts
it
is
publicly
well
known
that
our
late
husband
adored
us
and
that
we
mourned
for
him
sincerely
if
we
did
have
a
settlement
of
accounts
with
a
short
inventory
attached
made
as
one
may
say
by
common
report
you
can
thank
our
surrogate
guardian
who
obliged
us
to
establish
a
status
and
assign
to
our
daughter
a
fortune
such
as
it
is
at
a
time
when
we
were
forced
to
withdraw
from
london
our
english
securities
the
capital
of
which
was
immense
and
the
proceeds
in
paris
where
interests
were
don
t
talk
nonsense
to
me
there
are
various
ways
of
verifying
the
property
what
was
the
amount
of
your
legacy
tax
those
figures
will
enable
us
to
get
at
the
total
come
to
the
point
tell
us
frankly
what
you
received
from
the
father
s
estate
and
how
much
remains
of
it
if
we
are
very
much
in
love
we
ll
see
then
what
we
can
if
you
are
marrying
us
for
our
money
you
can
go
about
your
business
we
have
claims
to
more
than
a
million
but
all
that
remains
to
our
mother
is
this
house
and
furniture
and
four
hundred
odd
thousand
francs
invested
about
in
the
which
yield
about
francs
a
then
why
do
you
live
in
a
style
that
requires
one
hundred
thousand
a
year
at
the
least
cried
mathias
our
daughter
has
cost
us
the
eyes
out
of
our
head
replied
solonet
besides
we
like
to
spend
money
your
jeremiads
let
me
tell
you
won
t
recover
two
farthings
of
the
with
the
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
which
belong
to
mademoiselle
natalie
you
could
have
brought
her
up
handsomely
without
coming
to
ruin
but
if
you
have
squandered
everything
while
you
were
a
girl
what
will
it
be
when
you
are
a
married
woman
then
drop
us
altogether
said
solonet
the
handsomest
girl
in
bordeaux
has
a
right
to
spend
more
than
she
has
if
she
i
ll
talk
to
my
client
about
that
said
the
old
notary
very
good
old
father
cassandra
go
and
tell
your
client
that
we
haven
t
a
penny
thought
solonet
who
in
the
solitude
of
his
study
had
strategically
massed
his
forces
drawn
up
his
propositions
manned
the
drawbridge
of
discussion
and
prepared
the
point
at
which
the
opposing
party
thinking
the
affair
a
failure
could
suddenly
be
led
into
a
compromise
which
would
end
in
the
triumph
of
his
client
the
white
dress
with
its
ribbons
the
sevigne
curls
natalie
s
tiny
foot
her
winning
glance
her
pretty
fingers
constantly
employed
in
adjusting
curls
that
needed
no
adjustment
these
girlish
manoeuvres
like
those
of
a
peacock
spreading
his
tail
had
brought
paul
to
the
point
at
which
his
future
desired
to
see
him
he
was
intoxicated
with
love
and
his
eyes
the
sure
thermometer
of
the
soul
indicated
the
degree
of
passion
at
which
a
man
commits
a
thousand
follies
natalie
is
so
beautiful
he
whispered
to
the
mother
that
i
can
conceive
the
frenzy
which
leads
a
man
to
pay
for
his
happiness
by
madame
evangelista
replied
with
a
shake
of
her
head
lover
s
talk
my
dear
count
my
husband
never
said
such
charming
things
to
me
but
he
married
me
without
a
fortune
and
for
thirteen
years
he
never
caused
me
one
moment
s
is
that
a
lesson
you
are
giving
me
said
paul
laughing
you
know
how
i
love
you
my
dear
son
she
answered
pressing
his
hand
i
must
indeed
love
you
well
to
give
you
my
give
me
give
me
said
the
young
girl
waving
a
screen
of
indian
feathers
what
are
you
whispering
about
me
i
was
telling
her
replied
paul
how
much
i
love
you
since
etiquette
forbids
me
to
tell
it
to
why
i
fear
to
say
too
ah
you
know
too
well
how
to
offer
the
jewels
of
flattery
shall
i
tell
you
my
private
opinion
about
you
well
i
think
you
have
more
mind
than
a
lover
ought
to
have
to
be
the
pink
of
fashion
and
a
wit
as
well
she
added
dropping
her
eyes
is
to
have
too
many
advantages
a
man
should
choose
between
them
i
fear
too
and
why
we
must
not
talk
in
this
way
mamma
do
you
not
think
that
this
conversation
is
dangerous
inasmuch
as
the
contract
is
not
yet
signed
it
soon
will
be
said
paul
i
should
like
to
know
what
achilles
and
nestor
are
saying
to
each
other
in
the
next
room
said
natalie
nodding
toward
the
door
of
the
little
salon
with
a
childlike
expression
of
curiosity
they
are
talking
of
our
children
and
our
death
and
a
lot
of
other
such
trifles
they
are
counting
our
gold
to
see
if
we
can
keep
five
horses
in
the
stables
they
are
talking
also
of
deeds
of
gift
but
there
i
have
forestalled
how
so
have
i
not
given
myself
wholly
to
you
he
said
looking
straight
at
the
girl
whose
beauty
was
enhanced
by
the
blush
which
the
pleasure
of
this
answer
brought
to
her
face
mamma
how
can
i
acknowledge
so
much
my
dear
child
you
have
a
lifetime
before
you
in
which
to
return
it
to
make
the
daily
happiness
of
a
home
is
to
bring
a
treasure
into
it
i
had
no
other
fortune
when
i
do
you
like
lanstrac
asked
paul
addressing
natalie
how
could
i
fail
to
like
the
place
where
you
were
born
she
answered
i
wish
i
could
see
your
house
said
paul
do
you
not
want
to
know
if
i
shall
understand
your
tastes
and
arrange
the
house
to
suit
you
your
mother
had
made
a
husband
s
task
most
difficult
you
have
always
been
so
happy
but
where
love
is
infinite
nothing
is
my
dear
children
said
madame
evangelista
do
you
feel
willing
to
stay
in
bordeaux
after
your
marriage
if
you
have
the
courage
to
face
the
people
here
who
know
you
and
will
watch
and
hamper
you
so
be
it
but
if
you
feel
that
desire
for
a
solitude
together
which
can
hardly
be
expressed
let
us
go
to
paris
were
the
life
of
a
young
couple
can
pass
unnoticed
in
the
stream
there
alone
you
can
behave
as
lovers
without
fearing
to
seem
you
are
quite
right
said
paul
but
i
shall
hardly
have
time
to
get
my
house
ready
however
i
will
write
to
de
marsay
the
friend
on
whom
i
can
always
count
to
get
things
done
for
at
the
moment
when
paul
like
all
young
men
accustomed
to
satisfy
their
desires
without
previous
calculation
was
inconsiderately
binding
himself
to
the
expenses
of
a
stay
in
paris
maitre
mathias
entered
the
salon
and
made
a
sign
to
his
client
that
he
wished
to
speak
to
him
what
is
it
my
friend
asked
paul
following
the
old
man
to
the
recess
of
a
window
monsieur
le
comte
said
the
honest
lawyer
there
is
not
a
penny
of
dowry
my
advice
is
put
off
the
conference
to
another
day
so
that
you
may
gain
time
to
consider
your
proper
monsieur
paul
said
natalie
i
have
a
word
to
say
in
private
to
though
madame
evangelista
s
face
was
calm
no
jew
of
the
middle
ages
ever
suffered
greater
torture
in
his
caldron
of
boiling
oil
than
she
was
enduring
in
her
violet
velvet
gown
solonet
had
pledged
the
marriage
to
her
but
she
was
ignorant
of
the
means
and
conditions
of
success
the
anguish
of
this
uncertainty
was
intolerable
possibly
she
owed
her
safety
to
her
daughter
s
disobedience
natalie
had
considered
the
advice
of
her
mother
and
noted
her
anxiety
when
she
saw
the
success
of
her
own
coquetry
she
was
struck
to
the
heart
with
a
variety
of
contradictory
thoughts
without
blaming
her
mother
she
was
of
manoeuvres
the
object
of
which
was
undoubtedly
some
personal
game
she
was
also
seized
with
a
jealous
curiosity
which
is
easily
conceived
she
wanted
to
find
out
if
paul
loved
her
well
enough
to
rise
above
the
obstacles
that
her
mother
foresaw
and
which
she
now
saw
clouding
the
face
of
the
old
lawyer
these
ideas
and
sentiments
prompted
her
to
an
action
of
loyalty
which
became
her
well
but
for
all
that
the
blackest
perfidy
could
not
have
been
as
dangerous
as
her
present
innocence
paul
she
said
in
a
low
voice
and
she
so
called
him
for
the
first
time
if
any
difficulties
as
to
property
arise
to
separate
us
remember
that
i
free
you
from
all
engagements
and
will
allow
you
to
let
the
blame
of
such
a
rupture
rest
on
she
put
such
dignity
into
this
expression
of
her
generosity
that
paul
believed
in
her
disinterestedness
and
in
her
ignorance
of
the
strange
fact
that
his
notary
had
just
told
to
him
he
pressed
the
young
girl
s
hand
and
kissed
it
like
a
man
to
whom
love
is
more
precious
than
wealth
natalie
left
the
room
monsieur
le
comte
you
are
committing
a
great
folly
said
the
old
notary
rejoining
his
client
paul
grew
thoughtful
he
had
expected
to
unite
natalie
s
fortune
with
his
own
and
thus
obtain
for
his
married
life
an
income
of
one
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
and
however
much
a
man
may
be
in
love
he
can
not
pass
without
emotion
and
anxiety
from
the
prospect
of
a
hundred
thousand
to
the
certainty
of
thousand
a
year
and
the
duty
of
providing
for
a
woman
accustomed
to
every
luxury
my
daughter
is
no
longer
here
said
madame
evangelista
advancing
almost
regally
toward
her
and
his
notary
may
i
be
told
what
is
happening
madame
replied
mathias
alarmed
at
paul
s
silence
an
obstacle
which
i
fear
will
delay
us
has
arisen
at
these
words
maitre
solonet
issued
from
the
little
salon
and
cut
short
the
old
man
s
speech
by
a
remark
which
restored
paul
s
composure
overcome
by
the
remembrance
of
his
gallant
speeches
and
his
behavior
he
felt
unable
to
disown
them
or
to
change
his
course
he
longed
for
the
moment
to
fling
himself
into
a
gulf
solonet
s
words
relieved
him
there
is
a
way
said
the
younger
notary
with
an
easy
air
by
which
madame
can
meet
the
payment
which
is
due
to
her
daughter
madame
evangelista
possesses
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
from
an
investment
in
the
the
capital
of
which
will
soon
be
at
par
if
not
above
it
we
may
therefore
reckon
it
at
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
this
house
and
garden
are
fully
worth
two
hundred
thousand
on
that
estimate
madame
can
convey
by
the
marriage
contract
the
titles
of
that
property
to
her
daughter
reserving
only
a
life
interest
in
it
for
i
conclude
that
monsieur
le
comte
could
hardly
wish
to
leave
his
without
means
though
madame
has
certainly
run
through
her
fortune
she
is
still
able
to
make
good
that
of
her
daughter
or
very
nearly
women
are
most
unfortunate
in
having
no
knowledge
of
business
said
madame
evangelista
have
i
titles
to
property
and
what
are
paul
was
in
a
sort
of
ecstasy
as
he
listened
to
this
proposed
arrangement
the
old
notary
seeing
the
trap
and
his
client
with
one
foot
caught
in
it
was
petrified
for
a
moment
as
he
said
to
himself
i
am
certain
they
are
tricking
if
madame
will
follow
my
advice
said
solonet
she
will
secure
her
own
tranquillity
by
sacrificing
herself
in
this
way
she
may
be
sure
that
no
minors
will
ultimately
harass
her
for
we
never
know
who
may
live
and
who
may
die
monsieur
le
comte
will
then
give
due
acknowledgment
in
the
marriage
contract
of
having
received
the
sum
total
of
mademoiselle
evangelista
s
patrimonial
mathias
could
not
restrain
the
indignation
which
shone
in
his
eyes
and
flushed
his
face
and
that
sum
he
said
shaking
is
one
million
one
hundred
and
thousand
francs
according
to
the
document
why
don
t
you
ask
monsieur
le
comte
to
make
over
hic
et
nunc
his
whole
fortune
to
his
future
wife
said
mathias
it
would
be
more
honest
than
what
you
now
propose
i
will
not
allow
the
ruin
of
the
comte
de
manerville
to
take
place
under
my
very
eyes
he
made
a
step
as
if
to
address
his
client
who
was
silent
throughout
this
scene
as
if
dazed
by
it
but
he
turned
and
said
addressing
madame
evangelista
do
not
suppose
madame
that
i
think
you
a
party
to
these
ideas
of
my
brother
notary
i
consider
you
an
honest
woman
and
a
lady
who
knows
nothing
of
thank
you
brother
notary
said
solonet
you
know
that
there
can
be
no
offence
between
you
and
me
replied
mathias
madame
he
added
you
ought
to
know
the
result
of
this
proposed
arrangement
you
are
still
young
and
beautiful
enough
to
marry
again
ah
madame
said
the
old
man
noting
her
gesture
who
can
answer
for
themselves
on
that
point
i
did
not
suppose
monsieur
said
madame
evangelista
that
after
remaining
a
widow
for
the
seven
best
years
of
my
life
and
refusing
the
most
brilliant
offers
for
my
daughter
s
sake
i
should
be
suspected
of
such
a
piece
of
folly
as
marrying
again
at
years
of
age
if
we
were
not
talking
business
i
should
regard
your
suggestion
as
an
would
it
not
be
more
impertinent
if
i
suggested
that
you
could
not
marry
again
can
and
will
are
separate
terms
remarked
solonet
gallantly
well
resumed
maitre
mathias
we
will
say
nothing
of
your
marriage
you
may
and
we
all
desire
it
live
for
years
to
come
now
if
you
keep
for
yourself
the
in
your
daughter
s
patrimony
your
children
are
laid
on
the
shelf
for
the
best
years
of
their
what
does
that
mean
said
the
widow
i
don
t
understand
being
laid
on
a
solonet
the
man
of
elegance
and
good
taste
began
to
laugh
i
ll
translate
it
for
you
said
mathias
if
your
children
are
wise
they
will
think
of
the
future
to
think
of
the
future
means
laying
by
half
our
income
provided
we
have
only
two
children
to
whom
we
are
bound
to
give
a
fine
education
and
a
handsome
dowry
your
daughter
and
will
therefore
be
reduced
to
live
on
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
though
each
has
spent
fifty
thousand
while
still
unmarried
but
that
is
nothing
the
law
obliges
my
client
to
account
hereafter
to
his
children
for
the
eleven
hundred
and
thousand
francs
of
their
mother
s
patrimony
yet
he
may
not
have
received
them
if
his
wife
should
die
and
madame
should
survive
her
which
may
very
well
happen
to
sign
such
a
contract
is
to
fling
one
s
self
into
the
river
bound
hand
and
foot
you
wish
to
make
your
daughter
happy
do
you
not
if
she
loves
her
husband
a
fact
which
notaries
never
doubt
she
will
share
his
troubles
madame
i
see
enough
in
this
scheme
to
make
her
die
of
grief
and
anxiety
you
are
consigning
her
to
poverty
yes
madame
poverty
to
persons
accustomed
to
the
use
of
one
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
twenty
thousand
is
poverty
moreover
if
monsieur
le
comte
out
of
love
for
his
wife
were
guilty
of
extravagance
she
could
ruin
him
by
exercising
her
rights
when
misfortunes
overtook
him
i
plead
now
for
you
for
them
for
their
children
for
every
the
old
fellow
makes
a
lot
of
smoke
with
his
cannon
thought
maitre
solonet
giving
his
client
a
look
which
meant
keep
on
there
is
one
way
of
combining
all
interests
replied
madame
evangelista
calmly
i
can
reserve
to
myself
only
the
necessary
cost
of
living
in
a
convent
and
my
children
can
have
my
property
at
once
i
can
renounce
the
world
if
such
anticipated
death
conduces
to
the
welfare
of
my
madame
said
the
old
notary
let
us
take
time
to
consider
and
weigh
deliberately
the
course
we
had
best
pursue
to
conciliate
all
good
heavens
monsieur
cried
madame
evangelista
who
saw
defeat
in
delay
everything
has
already
been
considered
and
weighed
i
was
ignorant
of
what
the
process
of
marriage
is
in
france
i
am
a
spaniard
and
a
creole
i
did
not
know
that
in
order
to
marry
my
daughter
it
was
necessary
to
reckon
up
the
days
which
god
may
still
grant
me
that
my
child
would
suffer
because
i
live
that
i
do
harm
by
living
and
by
having
lived
when
my
husband
married
me
i
had
nothing
but
my
name
and
my
person
my
name
alone
was
a
fortune
to
him
which
dwarfed
his
own
what
wealth
can
equal
that
of
a
great
name
my
dowry
was
beauty
virtue
happiness
birth
education
can
money
give
those
treasures
if
natalie
s
father
could
overhear
this
conversation
his
generous
soul
would
be
wounded
forever
and
his
happiness
in
paradise
destroyed
i
dissipated
foolishly
perhaps
a
few
of
his
millions
without
a
quiver
ever
coming
to
his
eyelids
since
his
death
i
have
grown
economical
and
orderly
in
comparison
with
the
life
he
encouraged
me
to
lead
come
let
us
break
this
thing
off
monsieur
de
manerville
is
so
disappointed
that
i
no
descriptive
language
can
express
the
confusion
and
shock
which
the
words
break
off
introduced
into
the
conversation
it
is
enough
to
say
that
these
four
apparently
persons
all
talked
at
once
in
spain
people
marry
in
the
spanish
fashion
or
as
they
please
but
in
france
they
marry
according
to
french
law
sensibly
and
as
best
they
can
said
mathias
ah
madame
cried
paul
coming
out
of
his
stupefaction
you
mistake
my
this
is
not
a
matter
of
feeling
said
the
old
notary
trying
to
stop
his
client
from
concessions
we
are
concerned
now
with
the
interests
and
welfare
of
three
generations
have
wasted
the
missing
millions
we
are
simply
endeavoring
to
solve
difficulties
of
which
we
are
wholly
marry
us
and
don
t
haggle
said
solonet
haggle
do
you
call
it
haggling
to
defend
the
interests
of
father
and
mother
and
children
said
mathias
yes
said
paul
continuing
his
remarks
to
madame
evangelista
i
deplore
the
extravagance
of
my
youth
which
does
not
permit
me
to
stop
this
discussion
as
you
deplore
your
ignorance
of
business
and
your
involuntary
wastefulness
god
is
my
witness
that
i
am
not
thinking
at
this
moment
of
myself
a
simple
life
at
lanstrac
does
not
alarm
me
but
how
can
i
ask
mademoiselle
natalie
to
renounce
her
tastes
her
habits
her
very
existence
would
be
where
did
evangelista
get
his
millions
said
the
widow
monsieur
evangelista
was
in
business
replied
the
old
notary
he
played
in
the
great
game
of
commerce
he
despatched
ships
and
made
enormous
sums
we
are
simply
a
landowner
whose
capital
is
invested
whose
income
is
there
is
still
a
way
to
harmonize
all
interests
said
solonet
uttering
this
sentence
in
a
high
falsetto
tone
which
silenced
the
other
three
and
drew
their
eyes
and
their
attention
upon
himself
this
young
man
was
not
unlike
a
skilful
coachman
who
holds
the
reins
of
four
horses
and
amuses
himself
by
first
exciting
his
animals
and
then
subduing
them
he
had
let
loose
these
passions
and
then
in
turn
he
calmed
them
making
paul
whose
life
and
happiness
were
in
the
balance
sweat
in
his
harness
as
well
as
his
own
client
who
could
not
clearly
see
her
way
through
this
involved
discussion
madame
evangelista
he
continued
after
a
slight
pause
can
resign
her
investment
in
the
at
once
and
she
can
sell
this
house
i
can
get
three
hundred
thousand
francs
for
it
by
cutting
the
land
into
small
lots
out
of
that
sum
she
can
give
you
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
this
way
she
pays
down
nine
hundred
thousand
of
her
daughter
s
patrimony
immediately
that
to
be
sure
is
not
all
that
she
owes
her
daughter
but
where
will
you
find
in
france
a
better
dowry
very
good
said
maitre
mathias
but
what
then
becomes
of
madame
at
this
question
which
appeared
to
imply
consent
solonet
said
softly
to
himself
well
done
old
fox
i
ve
caught
you
madame
he
replied
aloud
will
keep
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
remaining
from
the
sale
of
the
house
this
sum
added
to
the
value
of
her
furniture
can
be
invested
in
an
annuity
which
will
give
her
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
monsieur
le
comte
can
arrange
to
provide
a
residence
for
her
under
his
roof
lanstrac
is
a
large
house
you
have
also
a
house
in
paris
he
went
on
addressing
himself
to
paul
madame
can
therefore
live
with
you
wherever
you
are
a
widow
with
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
no
household
to
maintain
is
richer
than
madame
was
when
she
possessed
her
whole
fortune
madame
evangelista
has
only
this
one
daughter
monsieur
le
comte
is
without
relations
it
will
be
many
years
before
your
heirs
attain
their
majority
no
conflict
of
interests
is
therefore
to
be
feared
a
and
a
placed
in
such
relations
will
form
a
household
of
united
interests
madame
evangelista
can
make
up
for
the
remaining
deficit
by
paying
a
certain
sum
for
her
support
from
her
annuity
which
will
ease
your
way
we
know
that
madame
is
too
generous
and
too
to
be
willing
to
be
a
burden
on
her
children
in
this
way
you
can
make
one
household
united
and
happy
and
be
able
to
spend
in
your
own
right
one
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
is
not
that
sum
sufficient
monsieur
le
comte
to
enjoy
in
all
countries
the
luxuries
of
life
and
to
satisfy
all
your
wants
and
caprices
believe
me
a
young
couple
often
feel
the
need
of
a
third
member
of
the
household
and
i
ask
you
what
third
member
could
be
so
desirable
as
a
good
mother
a
little
paradise
exclaimed
the
old
notary
shocked
to
see
his
client
s
joy
at
this
proposal
mathias
sat
down
on
an
ottoman
his
head
in
his
hands
plunged
in
reflections
that
were
evidently
painful
he
knew
well
the
involved
phraseology
in
which
notaries
and
lawyers
wrap
up
intentionally
malicious
schemes
and
he
was
not
the
man
to
be
taken
in
by
it
he
now
began
furtively
to
watch
his
brother
notary
and
madame
evangelista
as
they
conversed
with
paul
endeavoring
to
detect
some
clew
to
the
plot
which
was
beginning
to
appear
upon
the
surface
monsieur
said
paul
to
solonet
i
thank
you
for
the
pains
you
take
to
conciliate
our
interests
this
arrangement
will
solve
all
difficulties
far
more
happily
than
i
expected
if
he
added
turning
to
madame
evangelista
it
is
agreeable
to
you
madame
for
i
could
not
desire
anything
that
did
not
equally
please
i
she
said
all
that
makes
the
happiness
of
my
children
is
joy
to
me
do
not
consider
me
in
any
that
would
not
be
right
said
paul
eagerly
if
your
future
is
not
honorably
provided
for
natalie
and
i
would
suffer
more
than
you
would
suffer
for
don
t
be
uneasy
monsieur
le
comte
interposed
solonet
ah
thought
old
mathias
they
ll
make
him
kiss
the
rod
before
they
scourge
you
may
feel
quite
satisfied
continued
solonet
there
are
so
many
enterprises
going
on
in
bordeaux
at
this
moment
that
investments
for
annuities
can
be
negotiated
on
very
advantageous
terms
after
deducting
from
the
proceeds
of
the
house
and
furniture
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
we
owe
you
i
think
i
can
guarantee
to
madame
that
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
will
remain
to
her
i
take
upon
myself
to
invest
that
sum
in
a
first
mortgage
on
property
worth
a
million
and
to
obtain
ten
per
cent
for
it
thousand
francs
a
year
consequently
we
are
marrying
on
nearly
equal
fortunes
in
fact
against
your
thousand
francs
a
year
mademoiselle
natalie
brings
you
forty
thousand
a
year
in
the
and
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
in
a
round
sum
which
gives
in
all
thousand
francs
a
that
is
evident
said
paul
as
he
ended
his
speech
solonet
had
cast
a
sidelong
glance
at
his
client
intercepted
by
mathias
which
meant
bring
up
your
but
exclaimed
madame
evangelista
in
tones
of
joy
that
did
not
seem
to
be
feigned
i
can
give
natalie
my
diamonds
they
are
worth
at
least
a
hundred
thousand
we
can
have
them
appraised
said
the
notary
this
will
change
the
whole
face
of
things
madame
can
then
keep
the
proceeds
of
her
house
all
but
fifty
thousand
francs
nothing
will
prevent
monsieur
le
comte
from
giving
us
a
receipt
in
due
form
as
having
received
in
full
mademoiselle
natalie
s
inheritance
from
her
father
this
will
close
of
course
the
guardianship
account
if
madame
with
spanish
generosity
robs
herself
in
this
way
to
fulfil
her
obligations
the
least
that
her
children
can
do
is
to
give
her
a
full
nothing
could
be
more
just
than
that
said
paul
i
am
simply
overwhelmed
by
these
generous
my
daughter
is
another
myself
said
madame
evangelista
softly
maitre
mathias
detected
a
look
of
joy
on
her
face
when
she
saw
that
the
difficulties
were
being
removed
that
joy
and
the
previous
forgetfulness
of
the
diamonds
which
were
now
brought
forward
like
fresh
troops
confirmed
his
suspicions
the
scene
has
been
prepared
between
them
as
gamblers
prepare
the
cards
to
ruin
a
pigeon
thought
the
old
notary
is
this
poor
boy
whom
i
saw
born
doomed
to
be
plucked
alive
by
that
woman
roasted
by
his
very
love
and
devoured
by
his
wife
i
who
have
nursed
these
fine
estates
for
years
with
such
care
am
i
to
see
them
ruined
in
a
single
night
three
million
and
a
half
to
be
hypothecated
for
eleven
hundred
thousand
francs
these
women
will
force
him
to
squander
discovering
thus
in
the
soul
of
the
elder
woman
intentions
which
without
involving
crime
theft
swindling
or
any
actually
evil
or
blameworthy
action
nevertheless
belonged
to
all
those
criminalities
in
embryo
maitre
mathias
felt
neither
sorrow
nor
generous
indignation
he
was
not
the
misanthrope
he
was
an
old
notary
accustomed
in
his
business
to
the
shrewd
calculations
of
worldly
people
to
those
clever
bits
of
treachery
which
do
more
fatal
injury
than
open
murder
on
the
committed
by
some
poor
devil
who
is
guillotined
in
consequence
to
the
upper
classes
of
society
these
passages
in
life
these
diplomatic
meetings
and
discussions
are
like
the
necessary
cesspools
where
the
filth
of
life
is
thrown
full
of
pity
for
his
client
mathias
cast
a
foreseeing
eye
into
the
future
and
saw
nothing
good
we
ll
take
the
field
with
the
same
weapons
thought
he
and
beat
at
this
moment
paul
solonet
and
madame
evangelista
becoming
embarrassed
by
the
old
man
s
silence
felt
that
the
approval
of
that
censor
was
necessary
to
carry
out
the
transaction
and
all
three
turned
to
him
simultaneously
well
my
dear
monsieur
mathias
what
do
you
think
of
it
said
paul
this
is
what
i
think
said
the
conscientious
and
uncompromising
notary
you
are
not
rich
enough
to
commit
such
regal
folly
the
estate
of
lanstrac
if
estimated
at
three
per
cent
on
its
rentals
represents
with
its
furniture
one
million
the
farms
of
grassol
and
guadet
and
your
vineyard
of
are
worth
another
million
your
two
houses
in
bordeaux
and
paris
with
their
furniture
a
third
million
against
those
three
millions
yielding
thousand
francs
a
year
mademoiselle
natalie
brings
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
in
the
the
diamonds
supposing
them
to
be
worth
a
hundred
thousand
francs
which
is
still
problematical
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
money
in
all
one
million
and
fifty
thousand
francs
in
presence
of
such
facts
my
brother
notary
tells
you
boastfully
that
we
are
marrying
equal
fortunes
he
expects
us
to
encumber
ourselves
with
a
debt
of
eleven
hundred
and
thousand
francs
to
our
children
by
acknowledging
the
receipt
of
our
wife
s
patrimony
when
we
have
actually
received
but
little
more
than
a
doubtful
million
you
are
listening
to
such
stuff
with
the
rapture
of
a
lover
and
you
think
that
old
mathias
who
is
not
in
love
can
forget
arithmetic
and
will
not
point
out
the
difference
between
landed
estate
the
actual
value
of
which
is
enormous
and
constantly
increasing
and
the
revenues
of
personal
property
the
capital
of
which
is
subject
to
fluctuations
and
diminishment
of
income
i
am
old
enough
to
have
learned
that
money
dwindles
and
land
augments
you
have
called
me
in
monsieur
le
comte
to
stipulate
for
your
interests
either
let
me
defend
those
interests
or
dismiss
if
monsieur
is
seeking
a
fortune
equal
in
capital
to
his
own
said
solonet
we
certainly
can
not
give
it
to
him
we
do
not
possess
three
millions
and
a
half
nothing
can
be
more
evident
while
you
can
boast
of
your
three
overwhelming
millions
we
can
only
produce
our
poor
one
million
a
mere
nothing
in
your
eyes
though
three
times
the
dowry
of
an
archduchess
of
austria
bonaparte
received
only
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
with
was
the
ruin
of
bonaparte
muttered
mathias
natalie
s
mother
caught
the
words
if
my
sacrifices
are
worth
nothing
she
cried
i
do
not
choose
to
continue
such
a
discussion
i
trust
to
the
discretion
of
monsieur
le
comte
and
i
renounce
the
honor
of
his
hand
for
my
according
to
the
strategy
marked
out
by
the
younger
notary
this
battle
of
contending
interests
had
now
reached
the
point
where
victory
was
certain
for
madame
evangelista
the
had
opened
her
heart
delivered
up
her
property
and
was
therefore
practically
released
as
her
daughter
s
guardian
the
future
husband
under
pain
of
ignoring
the
laws
of
generous
propriety
and
being
false
to
love
ought
now
to
accept
these
conditions
previously
planned
and
cleverly
led
up
to
by
solonet
and
madame
evangelista
like
the
hands
of
a
clock
turned
by
mechanism
paul
came
faithfully
up
to
time
madame
he
exclaimed
is
it
possible
you
can
think
of
breaking
off
the
marriage
monsieur
she
replied
to
whom
am
i
accountable
to
my
daughter
when
she
is
years
of
age
she
will
receive
my
guardianship
account
and
release
me
she
will
then
possess
a
million
and
can
if
she
likes
choose
her
husband
among
the
sons
of
the
peers
of
france
she
is
a
daughter
of
the
madame
is
right
remarked
solonet
why
should
she
be
more
hardly
pushed
than
she
will
be
fourteen
months
hence
you
ought
not
to
deprive
her
of
the
benefits
of
her
mathias
cried
paul
in
deep
distress
there
are
two
sorts
of
ruin
and
you
are
bringing
one
upon
me
at
this
he
made
a
step
towards
the
old
notary
no
doubt
intending
to
tell
him
that
the
contract
must
be
drawn
at
once
but
mathias
stopped
that
disaster
with
a
glance
which
said
distinctly
wait
he
saw
the
tears
in
paul
s
eyes
tears
drawn
from
an
honorable
man
by
the
shame
of
this
discussion
as
much
as
by
the
peremptory
speech
of
madame
evangelista
threatening
rupture
and
the
old
man
stanched
them
with
a
gesture
like
that
of
archimedes
when
he
cried
eureka
the
words
peer
of
france
had
been
to
him
like
a
torch
in
a
dark
crypt
natalie
appeared
at
this
moment
dazzling
as
the
dawn
saying
with
infantine
look
and
manner
am
i
in
the
way
singularly
so
my
child
answered
her
mother
in
a
bitter
tone
come
in
dear
natalie
said
paul
taking
her
hand
and
leading
her
to
a
chair
near
the
fireplace
all
is
he
felt
it
impossible
to
endure
the
overthrow
of
their
mutual
hopes
yes
all
can
be
settled
said
mathias
hastily
interposing
like
a
general
who
in
a
moment
upsets
the
plans
skilfully
laid
and
prepared
by
the
enemy
the
old
notary
enlightened
by
that
genius
which
presides
over
notaries
saw
an
idea
capable
of
saving
the
future
of
paul
and
his
children
unfolding
itself
in
legal
form
before
his
eyes
maitre
solonet
who
perceived
no
other
way
out
of
these
irreconcilable
difficulties
than
the
resolution
with
which
paul
s
love
inspired
him
and
to
which
this
conflict
of
feelings
and
thwarted
interests
had
brought
him
was
extremely
surprised
at
the
sudden
exclamation
of
his
brother
notary
curious
to
know
the
remedy
that
mathias
had
found
in
a
state
of
things
which
had
seemed
to
him
beyond
all
other
relief
he
said
addressing
the
old
man
what
is
it
you
propose
natalie
my
dear
child
leave
us
said
madame
evangelista
mademoiselle
is
not
in
the
way
replied
mathias
smiling
i
am
going
to
speak
in
her
interests
as
well
as
in
those
of
monsieur
le
silence
reigned
for
a
moment
during
which
time
everybody
present
oppressed
with
anxiety
awaited
the
allocution
of
the
venerable
notary
with
unspeakable
curiosity
in
these
days
continued
maitre
mathias
after
a
pause
the
profession
of
notary
has
changed
from
what
it
was
political
revolutions
now
exert
an
influence
over
the
prospects
of
families
which
never
happened
in
former
times
in
those
days
existences
were
clearly
defined
so
were
rank
and
position
we
are
not
here
for
a
lecture
on
political
ceremony
but
to
draw
up
a
marriage
contract
said
solonet
interrupting
the
old
man
impatiently
i
beg
you
to
allow
me
to
speak
in
my
turn
as
i
see
fit
replied
the
other
solonet
turned
away
and
sat
down
on
the
ottoman
saying
in
a
low
voice
to
madame
evangelista
you
will
now
hear
what
we
call
in
the
profession
notaries
are
therefore
compelled
to
follow
the
course
of
political
events
which
are
now
intimately
connected
with
private
interests
here
is
an
example
formerly
noble
families
owned
fortunes
that
were
never
shaken
but
which
the
laws
promulgated
by
the
revolution
destroyed
and
the
present
system
tends
to
reconstruct
resumed
the
old
notary
yielding
to
the
loquacity
of
the
tabellionaris
monsieur
le
comte
by
his
name
his
talents
and
his
fortune
is
called
upon
to
sit
some
day
in
the
elective
chamber
perhaps
his
destiny
will
take
him
to
the
hereditary
chamber
for
we
know
that
he
has
talent
and
means
enough
to
fulfil
that
expectation
do
you
not
agree
with
me
madame
he
added
turning
to
the
widow
you
anticipate
my
dearest
hope
she
replied
monsieur
de
manerville
must
be
a
peer
of
france
or
i
shall
die
of
therefore
all
that
leads
to
that
end
continued
mathias
with
a
cordial
gesture
to
the
astute
will
promote
my
eager
desire
she
replied
well
then
said
mathias
is
not
this
marriage
the
proper
occasion
on
which
to
entail
the
estate
and
create
the
family
such
a
course
would
undoubtedly
militate
in
the
mind
of
the
present
government
in
favor
of
the
nomination
of
my
client
whenever
a
batch
of
appointments
is
sent
in
monsieur
le
comte
can
very
well
afford
to
devote
the
estate
of
lanstrac
which
is
worth
a
million
to
this
purpose
i
do
not
ask
that
mademoiselle
should
contribute
an
equal
sum
that
would
not
be
just
but
we
can
surely
apply
eight
hundred
thousand
of
her
patrimony
to
this
object
there
are
two
domains
adjoining
lanstrac
now
to
be
sold
which
can
be
purchased
for
that
sum
which
will
return
in
rentals
four
and
a
half
per
cent
the
house
in
paris
should
be
included
in
the
entail
the
surplus
of
the
two
fortunes
if
judiciously
managed
will
amply
suffice
for
the
fortunes
of
the
younger
children
if
the
contracting
parties
will
agree
to
this
arrangement
monsieur
ought
certainly
to
accept
your
guardianship
account
with
its
deficiency
i
consent
to
questa
coda
non
e
di
questo
gatto
that
tail
doesn
t
belong
to
that
cat
murmured
madame
evangelista
appealing
to
solonet
there
s
a
snake
in
the
grass
somewhere
answered
solonet
in
a
low
voice
replying
to
the
italian
proverb
with
a
french
one
why
do
you
make
this
fuss
asked
paul
leading
mathias
into
the
adjoining
salon
to
save
you
from
being
ruined
replied
the
old
notary
in
a
whisper
you
are
determined
to
marry
a
girl
and
her
mother
who
have
already
squandered
two
millions
in
seven
years
you
are
pledging
yourself
to
a
debt
of
eleven
hundred
thousand
francs
to
your
children
to
whom
you
will
have
to
account
for
the
fortune
you
are
acknowledging
to
have
received
with
their
mother
you
risk
having
your
own
fortune
squandered
in
five
years
and
to
be
left
as
naked
as
himself
besides
being
a
debtor
to
your
wife
and
children
for
enormous
sums
if
you
are
determined
to
put
your
life
in
that
boat
monsieur
le
comte
of
course
you
can
do
as
you
choose
but
at
least
let
me
your
old
friend
try
to
save
the
house
of
how
is
this
scheme
going
to
save
it
asked
paul
monsieur
le
comte
you
are
in
love
a
lover
is
about
as
discreet
as
a
therefore
i
shall
not
explain
if
you
repeated
what
i
should
say
your
marriage
would
probably
be
broken
off
i
protect
your
love
by
my
silence
have
you
confidence
in
my
devotion
a
fine
question
well
then
believe
me
when
i
tell
you
that
madame
evangelista
her
notary
and
her
daughter
are
tricking
us
through
thick
and
thin
they
are
more
than
clever
tudieu
what
a
sly
game
not
natalie
cried
paul
i
sha
n
t
put
my
fingers
between
the
bark
and
the
tree
said
the
old
man
you
want
her
take
her
but
i
wish
you
were
well
out
of
this
marriage
if
it
could
be
done
without
the
least
on
your
why
do
you
wish
it
because
that
girl
will
spend
the
mines
of
peru
besides
see
how
she
rides
a
horse
like
the
groom
of
a
circus
she
is
half
emancipated
already
such
girls
make
bad
paul
pressed
the
old
man
s
hand
saying
with
a
confident
air
of
don
t
be
uneasy
as
to
that
but
now
at
this
moment
what
am
i
to
do
hold
firm
to
my
conditions
they
will
consent
for
no
one
s
apparent
interest
is
injured
madame
evangelista
is
very
anxious
to
marry
her
daughter
i
see
that
in
her
little
game
beware
of
her
paul
returned
to
the
salon
where
he
found
his
future
conversing
in
a
low
tone
with
solonet
natalie
kept
outside
of
these
mysterious
conferences
was
playing
with
a
screen
embarrassed
by
her
position
she
was
thinking
to
herself
how
odd
it
is
that
they
tell
me
nothing
of
my
own
the
younger
notary
had
seized
in
the
main
the
future
effect
of
the
new
proposal
based
as
it
was
on
the
of
both
parties
into
which
his
client
had
fallen
headlong
now
while
mathias
was
more
than
a
mere
notary
solonet
was
still
a
young
man
and
brought
into
his
business
the
vanity
of
youth
it
often
happens
that
personal
conceit
makes
a
man
forgetful
of
the
interests
of
his
client
in
this
case
maitre
solonet
who
would
not
suffer
the
widow
to
think
that
nestor
had
vanquished
achilles
advised
her
to
conclude
the
marriage
on
the
terms
proposed
little
he
cared
for
the
future
working
of
the
marriage
contract
to
him
the
conditions
of
victory
were
madame
evangelista
released
from
her
obligations
as
guardian
her
future
secured
and
natalie
married
bordeaux
shall
know
that
you
have
ceded
eleven
hundred
thousand
francs
to
your
daughter
and
that
you
still
have
thousand
francs
a
year
left
whispered
solonet
to
his
client
for
my
part
i
did
not
expect
to
obtain
such
a
fine
but
she
said
explain
to
me
why
the
creation
of
this
entail
should
have
calmed
the
storm
at
it
relieves
their
distrust
of
you
and
your
daughter
an
entail
is
unchangeable
neither
husband
nor
wife
can
touch
that
then
this
arrangement
is
positively
insulting
no
we
call
it
simply
precaution
the
old
fellow
has
caught
you
in
a
net
if
you
refuse
to
consent
to
the
entail
he
can
reply
then
your
object
is
to
squander
the
fortune
of
my
client
who
by
the
creation
of
this
entail
is
protected
from
all
such
injury
as
securely
as
if
the
marriage
took
place
under
the
regime
solonet
quieted
his
own
scruples
by
reflecting
after
all
these
stipulations
will
take
effect
only
in
the
future
by
which
time
madame
evangelista
will
be
dead
and
madame
evangelista
contented
herself
for
the
present
with
these
explanations
having
full
confidence
in
solonet
she
was
wholly
ignorant
of
law
considering
her
daughter
as
good
as
married
she
thought
she
had
gained
her
end
and
was
filled
with
the
joy
of
success
thus
as
mathias
had
shrewdly
calculated
neither
solonet
nor
madame
evangelista
understood
as
yet
to
its
full
extent
this
scheme
which
he
had
based
on
reasons
that
were
undeniable
well
monsieur
mathias
said
the
widow
all
is
for
the
best
is
it
not
madame
if
you
and
monsieur
le
comte
consent
to
this
arrangement
you
ought
to
exchange
pledges
it
is
fully
understood
i
suppose
he
continued
looking
from
one
to
the
other
that
the
marriage
will
only
take
place
on
condition
of
creating
an
entail
upon
the
estate
of
lanstrac
and
the
house
in
the
rue
de
la
pepiniere
together
with
eight
hundred
thousand
francs
in
money
brought
by
the
future
wife
the
said
sum
to
be
invested
in
landed
property
pardon
me
the
repetition
madame
but
a
positive
and
solemn
engagement
becomes
absolutely
necessary
the
creation
of
an
entail
requires
formalities
application
to
the
chancellor
a
royal
ordinance
and
we
ought
at
once
to
conclude
the
purchase
of
the
new
estate
in
order
that
the
property
be
included
in
the
royal
ordinance
by
virtue
of
which
it
becomes
inalienable
in
many
families
this
would
be
reduced
to
writing
but
on
this
occasion
i
think
a
simple
consent
would
suffice
do
you
consent
yes
replied
madame
evangelista
yes
said
paul
and
i
asked
natalie
laughing
you
are
a
minor
mademoiselle
replied
solonet
don
t
complain
of
it
was
then
agreed
that
maitre
mathias
should
draw
up
the
contract
maitre
solonet
the
guardianship
account
and
release
and
that
both
documents
should
be
signed
as
the
law
requires
some
days
before
the
celebration
of
the
marriage
after
a
few
polite
salutations
the
notaries
withdrew
it
rains
mathias
shall
i
take
you
home
said
solonet
my
cabriolet
is
my
carriage
is
here
too
said
paul
manifesting
an
intention
to
accompany
the
old
man
i
won
t
rob
you
of
a
moment
s
pleasure
said
mathias
i
accept
my
friend
solonet
s
well
said
achilles
to
nestor
as
the
cabriolet
rolled
away
you
have
been
truly
patriarchal
the
fact
is
those
young
people
would
certainly
have
ruined
i
felt
anxious
about
their
future
replied
mathias
keeping
silent
as
to
the
real
motives
of
his
proposition
at
this
moment
the
two
notaries
were
like
a
pair
of
actors
arm
in
arm
behind
the
stage
on
which
they
have
played
a
scene
of
hatred
and
provocation
but
said
solonet
thinking
of
his
rights
as
notary
isn
t
it
my
place
to
buy
that
land
you
mentioned
the
money
is
part
of
our
how
can
you
put
property
bought
in
the
name
of
mademoiselle
evangelista
into
the
creation
of
an
entail
by
the
comte
de
manerville
replied
mathias
we
shall
have
to
ask
the
chancellor
about
that
said
solonet
but
i
am
the
notary
of
the
seller
as
well
as
of
the
buyer
of
that
land
said
mathias
besides
monsieur
de
manerville
can
buy
in
his
own
name
at
the
time
of
payment
we
can
make
mention
of
the
fact
that
the
dowry
funds
are
put
into
you
ve
an
answer
for
everything
old
man
said
solonet
laughing
you
were
really
surpassing
you
beat
us
for
an
old
fellow
who
didn
t
expect
your
batteries
of
i
did
pretty
well
didn
t
i
ha
ha
ha
laughed
solonet
the
odious
struggle
in
which
the
material
welfare
of
a
family
had
been
so
perilously
near
destruction
was
to
the
two
notaries
nothing
more
than
a
matter
of
professional
polemics
i
haven
t
been
forty
years
in
harness
for
nothing
remarked
mathias
look
here
solonet
he
added
i
m
a
good
fellow
you
shall
help
in
drawing
the
deeds
for
the
sale
of
those
thanks
my
dear
mathias
i
ll
serve
you
in
return
on
the
very
first
while
the
two
notaries
were
peacefully
returning
homeward
with
no
other
sensations
than
a
little
throaty
warmth
paul
and
madame
evangelista
were
left
a
prey
to
the
nervous
trepidation
the
quivering
of
the
flesh
and
brain
which
excitable
natures
pass
through
after
a
scene
in
which
their
interests
and
their
feelings
have
been
violently
shaken
in
madame
evangelista
these
last
mutterings
of
the
storm
were
overshadowed
by
a
terrible
reflection
a
lurid
gleam
which
she
wanted
at
any
cost
to
dispel
has
maitre
mathias
destroyed
in
a
few
minutes
the
work
i
have
been
doing
for
six
months
she
asked
herself
was
he
withdrawing
paul
from
my
influence
by
filling
his
mind
with
suspicion
during
their
secret
conference
in
the
next
room
she
was
standing
absorbed
in
these
thoughts
before
the
fireplace
her
elbow
resting
on
the
marble
when
the
closed
behind
the
carriage
of
the
two
notaries
she
turned
to
her
future
impatient
to
solve
her
doubts
this
has
been
the
most
terrible
day
of
my
life
cried
paul
overjoyed
to
see
all
difficulties
vanish
i
know
no
one
so
downright
in
speech
as
that
old
mathias
may
god
hear
him
and
make
me
peer
of
france
dear
natalie
i
desire
this
for
your
sake
more
than
for
my
own
you
are
my
ambition
i
live
only
in
hearing
this
speech
uttered
in
the
accents
of
the
heart
and
noting
more
especially
the
limpid
azure
of
paul
s
eyes
whose
glance
betrayed
no
thought
of
double
meaning
madame
evangelista
s
satisfaction
was
complete
she
regretted
the
sharp
language
with
which
she
had
spurred
him
and
in
the
joy
of
success
she
resolved
to
reassure
him
as
to
the
future
calming
her
countenance
and
giving
to
her
eyes
that
expression
of
tender
friendship
which
made
her
so
attractive
she
smiled
and
answered
i
can
say
as
much
to
you
perhaps
dear
paul
my
spanish
nature
has
led
me
farther
than
my
heart
desired
be
what
you
are
kind
as
god
himself
and
do
not
be
angry
with
me
for
a
few
hasty
words
shake
paul
was
abashed
he
fancied
himself
to
blame
and
he
kissed
madame
evangelista
dear
paul
she
said
with
much
emotion
why
could
not
those
two
sharks
have
settled
this
matter
without
dragging
us
into
it
since
it
was
so
easy
to
settle
in
that
case
i
should
not
have
known
how
grand
and
generous
you
can
be
replied
paul
indeed
she
is
paul
cried
natalie
pressing
his
hand
we
have
still
a
few
little
matters
to
settle
my
dear
son
said
madame
evangelista
my
daughter
and
i
are
above
the
foolish
vanities
to
which
so
many
persons
cling
natalie
does
not
need
my
diamonds
but
i
am
glad
to
give
them
to
ah
my
dear
mother
do
you
suppose
that
i
will
accept
them
yes
my
child
they
are
one
of
the
conditions
of
the
i
will
not
allow
it
i
will
not
marry
at
all
cried
natalie
vehemently
keep
those
jewels
which
my
father
took
such
pride
in
collecting
for
you
how
could
monsieur
paul
exact
hush
my
dear
said
her
mother
whose
eyes
now
filled
with
tears
my
ignorance
of
business
compels
me
to
a
greater
sacrifice
than
what
sacrifice
i
must
sell
my
house
in
order
to
pay
the
money
that
i
owe
to
what
money
can
you
possibly
owe
to
me
she
said
to
me
who
owe
you
life
if
my
marriage
costs
you
the
slightest
sacrifice
i
will
not
child
dear
natalie
try
to
understand
that
neither
i
nor
your
mother
nor
you
yourself
require
these
sacrifices
but
our
suppose
i
do
not
marry
at
all
do
you
not
love
me
said
paul
tenderly
come
come
my
silly
child
do
you
imagine
that
a
contract
is
like
a
house
of
cards
which
you
can
blow
down
at
will
dear
little
ignoramus
you
don
t
know
what
trouble
we
have
had
to
found
an
entail
for
the
benefit
of
your
eldest
son
don
t
cast
us
back
into
the
discussions
from
which
we
have
just
why
do
you
wish
to
ruin
my
mother
said
natalie
looking
at
paul
why
are
you
so
rich
he
replied
smiling
don
t
quarrel
my
children
you
are
not
yet
married
said
madame
evangelista
paul
she
continued
you
are
not
to
give
either
corbeille
or
jewels
or
trousseau
natalie
has
everything
in
profusion
lay
by
the
money
you
would
otherwise
put
into
wedding
presents
i
know
nothing
more
stupidly
bourgeois
and
commonplace
than
to
spend
a
hundred
thousand
francs
on
a
corbeille
when
five
thousand
a
year
given
to
a
young
woman
saves
her
much
anxiety
and
lasts
her
lifetime
besides
the
money
for
a
corbeille
is
needed
to
decorate
your
house
in
paris
we
will
return
to
lanstrac
in
the
spring
for
solonet
is
to
settle
my
debts
during
the
all
is
for
the
best
cried
paul
at
the
summit
of
happiness
so
i
shall
see
paris
cried
natalie
in
a
tone
that
would
justly
have
alarmed
de
marsay
if
we
decide
upon
this
plan
said
paul
i
ll
write
to
de
marsay
and
get
him
to
take
a
box
for
me
at
the
bouffons
and
also
at
the
italian
you
are
very
kind
i
should
never
have
dared
to
ask
for
it
said
natalie
marriage
is
a
very
agreeable
institution
if
it
gives
husbands
a
talent
for
divining
the
wishes
of
their
it
is
nothing
else
replied
paul
but
see
how
late
it
is
i
ought
to
why
leave
so
soon
said
madame
evangelista
employing
those
coaxing
ways
to
which
men
are
so
sensitive
though
all
this
passed
on
the
best
of
terms
and
according
to
the
laws
of
the
most
exquisite
politeness
the
effect
of
the
discussion
of
these
contending
interests
had
nevertheless
cast
between
son
and
a
seed
of
distrust
and
enmity
which
was
liable
to
sprout
under
the
first
heat
of
anger
or
the
warmth
of
a
feeling
too
harshly
bruised
in
most
families
the
settlement
of
dots
and
the
deeds
of
gift
required
by
a
marriage
contract
give
rise
to
primitive
emotions
of
hostility
caused
by
by
the
lesion
of
certain
sentiments
by
regret
for
the
sacrifices
made
and
by
the
desire
to
diminish
them
when
difficulties
arise
there
is
always
a
victorious
side
and
a
vanquished
one
the
parents
of
the
future
pair
try
to
conclude
the
matter
which
is
purely
commercial
in
their
eyes
to
their
own
advantage
and
this
leads
to
the
trickery
shrewdness
and
deception
of
such
negotiations
generally
the
husband
alone
is
initiated
into
the
secret
of
these
discussions
and
the
wife
is
kept
like
natalie
in
ignorance
of
the
stipulations
which
make
her
rich
or
poor
as
he
left
the
house
paul
reflected
that
thanks
to
the
cleverness
of
his
notary
his
fortune
was
almost
entirely
secured
from
injury
if
madame
evangelista
did
not
live
apart
from
her
daughter
their
united
household
would
have
an
income
of
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
francs
to
spend
all
his
expectations
of
a
happy
and
comfortable
life
would
be
realized
my
seems
to
me
an
excellent
woman
he
thought
still
under
the
influence
of
the
cajoling
manner
by
which
she
had
endeavored
to
disperse
the
clouds
raised
by
the
discussion
mathias
is
mistaken
these
notaries
are
strange
fellows
they
envenom
everything
the
harm
started
from
that
little
solonet
who
wanted
to
play
a
clever
while
paul
went
to
bed
recapitulating
the
advantages
he
had
won
during
the
evening
madame
evangelista
was
congratulating
herself
equally
on
her
victory
well
darling
mother
are
you
satisfied
said
natalie
following
madame
evangelista
into
her
bedroom
yes
love
replied
the
mother
everything
went
well
according
to
my
wishes
i
feel
a
weight
lifted
from
my
shoulders
which
was
crushing
me
paul
is
a
most
man
dear
fellow
yes
certainly
we
must
make
his
life
prosperous
you
will
make
him
happy
and
i
will
be
responsible
for
his
political
success
the
spanish
ambassador
used
to
be
a
friend
of
mine
and
i
ll
renew
the
relation
as
i
will
with
the
rest
of
my
old
acquaintance
oh
you
ll
see
we
shall
soon
be
in
the
very
heart
of
parisian
life
all
will
be
enjoyment
for
us
you
shall
have
the
pleasures
my
dearest
and
i
the
last
occupation
of
existence
the
game
of
ambition
don
t
be
alarmed
when
you
see
me
selling
this
house
do
you
suppose
we
shall
ever
come
back
to
live
in
bordeaux
no
lanstrac
yes
but
we
shall
spend
all
our
winters
in
paris
where
our
real
interests
lie
well
natalie
tell
me
was
it
very
difficult
to
do
what
i
asked
of
you
my
little
mamma
every
now
and
then
i
felt
solonet
advises
me
to
put
the
proceeds
of
this
house
into
an
annuity
said
madame
evangelista
but
i
shall
do
otherwise
i
won
t
take
a
penny
of
my
fortune
from
i
saw
you
were
all
very
angry
said
natalie
how
did
the
tempest
calm
down
by
an
offer
of
my
diamonds
replied
madame
evangelista
solonet
was
right
how
ably
he
conducted
the
whole
affair
get
out
my
natalie
i
have
never
seriously
considered
what
my
diamonds
are
worth
when
i
said
a
hundred
thousand
francs
i
talked
nonsense
madame
de
gyas
always
declared
that
the
necklace
and
your
father
gave
me
on
our
marriage
day
were
worth
at
least
that
sum
my
poor
husband
was
so
lavish
then
my
family
diamond
the
one
philip
the
second
gave
to
the
duke
of
alba
and
which
my
aunt
bequeathed
to
me
the
discreto
was
i
think
appraised
in
former
times
at
four
thousand
quadruples
one
of
our
spanish
gold
natalie
laid
out
upon
her
mother
s
the
pearl
necklace
the
sets
of
jewels
the
gold
bracelets
and
precious
stones
of
all
description
with
that
inexpressible
sensation
enjoyed
by
certain
women
at
the
sight
of
such
treasures
by
which
so
commentators
on
the
talmud
say
the
fallen
angels
seduce
the
daughters
of
men
having
sought
these
flowers
of
celestial
fire
in
the
bowels
of
the
earth
certainly
said
madame
evangelista
though
i
know
nothing
about
jewels
except
how
to
accept
and
wear
them
i
think
there
must
be
a
great
deal
of
money
in
these
then
if
we
make
but
one
household
i
can
sell
my
plate
the
weight
of
which
as
mere
silver
would
bring
thirty
thousand
francs
i
remember
when
we
brought
it
from
lima
the
officers
weighed
and
appraised
it
solonet
is
right
i
ll
send
to
elie
magus
the
jew
shall
estimate
the
value
of
these
things
perhaps
i
can
avoid
sinking
any
of
my
fortune
in
an
what
a
beautiful
pearl
necklace
said
natalie
he
ought
to
give
it
to
you
if
he
loves
you
replied
her
mother
and
i
think
he
might
have
all
my
other
jewels
reset
and
let
you
keep
them
the
diamonds
are
a
part
of
your
property
in
the
contract
and
now
my
darling
after
the
fatigues
of
this
day
we
both
need
the
woman
of
luxury
the
creole
the
great
lady
incapable
of
analyzing
the
results
of
a
contract
which
was
not
yet
in
force
went
to
sleep
in
the
joy
of
seeing
her
daughter
married
to
a
man
who
was
easy
to
manage
who
would
let
them
both
be
mistresses
of
his
home
and
whose
fortune
united
to
theirs
would
require
no
change
in
their
way
of
living
thus
having
settled
her
account
with
her
daughter
whose
patrimony
was
acknowledged
in
the
contract
madame
evangelista
could
feel
at
her
ease
how
foolish
of
me
to
worry
as
i
did
she
thought
but
i
wish
the
marriage
were
well
so
madame
evangelista
paul
natalie
and
the
two
notaries
were
equally
satisfied
with
the
first
day
s
result
the
te
deum
was
sung
in
both
camps
a
dangerous
situation
for
there
comes
a
moment
when
the
vanquished
side
is
aware
of
its
mistake
to
madame
evangelista
s
mind
her
was
the
vanquished
side
chapter
iv
the
marriage
contract
second
day
the
next
day
elie
magus
who
happened
at
that
time
to
be
in
bordeaux
obeyed
madame
evangelista
s
summons
believing
from
general
rumor
as
to
the
marriage
of
comte
paul
with
mademoiselle
natalie
that
it
concerned
a
purchase
of
jewels
for
the
bride
the
jew
was
therefore
astonished
when
he
learned
that
on
the
contrary
he
was
sent
for
to
estimate
the
value
of
the
s
property
the
instinct
of
his
race
as
well
as
certain
insidious
questions
made
him
aware
that
the
value
of
the
diamonds
was
included
in
the
the
stones
were
not
to
be
sold
and
yet
he
was
to
estimate
them
as
if
some
private
person
were
buying
them
from
a
dealer
jewellers
alone
know
how
to
distinguish
between
the
diamonds
of
asia
and
those
of
brazil
the
stones
of
golconda
and
visapur
are
known
by
a
whiteness
and
glittering
brilliancy
which
others
have
not
the
water
of
the
brazilian
diamonds
having
a
yellow
tinge
which
reduces
their
selling
value
madame
evangelista
s
necklace
and
being
composed
entirely
of
asiatic
diamonds
were
valued
by
elie
magus
at
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
as
for
the
discreto
he
pronounced
it
one
of
the
finest
diamonds
in
the
possession
of
private
persons
it
was
known
to
the
trade
and
valued
at
one
hundred
thousand
francs
on
hearing
this
estimate
which
proved
to
her
the
lavishness
of
her
husband
madame
evangelista
asked
the
old
jew
whether
she
should
be
able
to
obtain
that
money
immediately
madame
replied
the
jew
if
you
wish
to
sell
i
can
give
you
only
thousand
for
the
brilliant
and
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
for
the
necklace
and
why
such
reduction
madame
replied
magus
the
finer
the
diamond
the
longer
we
keep
it
unsold
the
rarity
of
such
investments
is
one
reason
for
the
high
value
set
upon
precious
stones
as
the
merchant
can
not
lose
the
interest
of
his
money
this
additional
sum
joined
to
the
rise
and
fall
to
which
such
merchandise
is
subject
explains
the
difference
between
the
price
of
purchase
and
the
price
of
sale
by
owning
these
diamonds
you
have
lost
the
interest
on
three
hundred
thousand
francs
for
twenty
years
if
you
wear
your
jewels
ten
times
a
year
it
costs
you
three
thousand
francs
each
evening
to
put
them
on
how
many
beautiful
gowns
you
could
buy
with
that
sum
those
who
own
diamonds
are
therefore
very
foolish
but
luckily
for
us
women
are
never
willing
to
understand
the
i
thank
you
for
explaining
it
to
me
and
i
shall
profit
by
do
you
wish
to
sell
asked
magus
eagerly
what
are
the
other
jewels
worth
the
jew
examined
the
gold
of
the
settings
held
the
pearls
to
the
light
scrutinized
the
rubies
the
diadems
clasps
bracelets
and
chains
and
said
in
a
mumbling
tone
a
good
many
portuguese
diamonds
from
brazil
are
among
them
they
are
not
worth
more
than
a
hundred
thousand
to
me
but
he
added
a
dealer
would
sell
them
to
a
customer
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
at
i
shall
keep
them
said
madame
evangelista
you
are
wrong
replied
elie
magus
with
the
income
from
the
sum
they
represent
you
could
buy
just
as
fine
diamonds
in
five
years
and
have
the
capital
to
this
singular
conference
became
known
and
corroborated
certain
rumors
excited
by
the
discussion
of
the
contract
the
servants
of
the
house
overhearing
high
voices
supposed
the
difficulties
greater
than
they
really
were
their
gossip
with
other
valets
spread
the
information
which
from
the
lower
regions
rose
to
the
ears
of
the
masters
the
attention
of
society
and
of
the
town
in
general
became
so
fixed
on
the
marriage
of
two
persons
equally
rich
and
that
every
one
great
and
small
busied
themselves
about
the
matter
and
in
less
than
a
week
the
strangest
rumors
were
bruited
about
madame
evangelista
sells
her
house
she
must
be
ruined
she
offered
her
diamonds
to
elie
magus
nothing
is
really
settled
between
herself
and
the
comte
de
manerville
is
it
probable
that
the
marriage
will
ever
take
place
to
this
question
some
answered
yes
and
others
said
no
the
two
notaries
when
questioned
denied
these
calumnies
and
declared
that
the
difficulties
arose
only
from
the
official
delay
in
constituting
the
entail
but
when
public
opinion
has
taken
a
trend
in
one
direction
it
is
very
difficult
to
turn
it
back
though
paul
went
every
day
to
madame
evangelista
s
house
and
though
the
notaries
denied
these
assertions
continually
the
whispered
calumny
went
on
young
girls
and
their
mothers
and
aunts
vexed
at
a
marriage
they
had
dreamed
of
for
themselves
or
for
their
families
could
not
forgive
the
spanish
ladies
for
their
happiness
as
authors
can
not
forgive
each
other
for
their
success
a
few
persons
revenged
themselves
for
the
luxury
and
grandeur
of
the
family
of
evangelista
which
had
lain
heavily
on
their
a
leading
personage
at
the
prefecture
declared
that
the
notaries
could
have
chosen
no
other
language
and
followed
no
other
conduct
in
the
case
of
a
rupture
the
time
actually
required
for
the
establishment
of
the
entail
confirmed
the
suspicions
of
the
bordeaux
provincials
they
will
keep
the
ball
going
through
the
winter
then
in
the
spring
they
will
go
to
some
and
we
shall
learn
before
the
year
is
out
that
the
marriage
is
and
of
course
we
shall
be
given
to
understand
said
others
for
the
sake
of
the
honor
of
the
two
families
that
the
difficulties
did
not
come
from
either
side
but
the
chancellor
refused
to
consent
you
may
be
sure
it
will
be
some
quibble
about
that
entail
which
will
cause
the
madame
evangelista
some
said
lived
in
a
style
that
the
mines
of
valencia
couldn
t
meet
when
the
time
came
to
melt
the
bell
and
pay
the
daughter
s
patrimony
nothing
would
be
found
to
pay
it
the
occasion
was
excellent
to
add
up
the
spendings
of
the
handsome
widow
and
prove
categorically
her
ruin
rumors
were
so
rife
that
bets
were
made
for
and
against
the
marriage
by
the
laws
of
worldly
jurisprudence
this
gossip
was
not
allowed
to
reach
the
ears
of
the
parties
concerned
no
one
was
enemy
or
friend
enough
to
paul
or
to
madame
evangelista
to
inform
either
of
what
was
being
said
paul
had
some
business
at
lanstrac
and
used
the
occasion
to
make
a
for
several
of
the
young
men
of
bordeaux
a
sort
of
farewell
as
it
were
to
his
bachelor
life
this
hunting
party
was
accepted
by
society
as
a
signal
confirmation
of
public
suspicion
when
this
event
occurred
madame
de
gyas
who
had
a
daughter
to
marry
thought
it
high
time
to
sound
the
matter
and
to
condole
with
joyful
heart
the
blow
received
by
the
evangelistas
natalie
and
her
mother
were
somewhat
surprised
to
see
the
lengthened
face
of
the
marquise
and
they
asked
at
once
if
anything
distressing
had
happened
to
her
can
it
be
she
replied
that
you
are
ignorant
of
the
rumors
that
are
circulating
though
i
think
them
false
myself
i
have
come
to
learn
the
truth
in
order
to
stop
this
gossip
at
any
rate
among
the
circle
of
my
own
friends
to
be
the
dupes
or
the
accomplices
of
such
an
error
is
too
false
a
position
for
true
friends
to
but
what
is
it
what
has
happened
asked
mother
and
daughter
madame
de
gyas
thereupon
allowed
herself
the
happiness
of
repeating
all
the
current
gossip
not
sparing
her
two
friends
a
single
stab
natalie
and
madame
evangelista
looked
at
each
other
and
laughed
but
they
fully
understood
the
meaning
of
the
tale
and
the
motives
of
their
friend
the
spanish
lady
took
her
revenge
very
much
as
celimene
took
hers
on
arsinoe
my
dear
are
you
ignorant
you
who
know
the
provinces
so
well
can
you
be
ignorant
of
what
a
mother
is
capable
when
she
has
on
her
hands
a
daughter
whom
she
can
not
marry
for
want
of
dot
and
lovers
want
of
beauty
want
of
mind
and
sometimes
want
of
everything
why
a
mother
in
that
position
would
rob
a
diligence
or
commit
a
murder
or
wait
for
a
man
at
the
corner
of
a
street
she
would
sacrifice
herself
twenty
times
over
if
she
was
a
mother
at
all
now
as
you
and
i
both
know
there
are
many
such
in
that
situation
in
bordeaux
and
no
doubt
they
attribute
to
us
their
own
thoughts
and
actions
naturalists
have
depicted
the
habits
and
customs
of
many
ferocious
animals
but
they
have
forgotten
the
mother
and
daughter
in
quest
of
a
husband
such
women
are
hyenas
going
about
as
the
psalmist
says
seeking
whom
they
may
devour
and
adding
to
the
instinct
of
the
brute
the
intellect
of
man
and
the
genius
of
woman
i
can
understand
that
those
little
spiders
mademoiselle
de
belor
mademoiselle
de
trans
and
others
after
working
so
long
at
their
webs
without
catching
a
fly
without
so
much
as
hearing
a
buzz
should
be
furious
i
can
even
forgive
their
spiteful
speeches
but
that
you
who
can
marry
your
daughter
when
you
please
you
who
are
rich
and
titled
you
who
have
nothing
of
the
provincial
about
you
whose
daughter
is
clever
and
possesses
fine
qualities
with
beauty
and
the
power
to
choose
that
you
so
distinguished
from
the
rest
by
your
parisian
grace
should
have
paid
the
least
heed
to
this
talk
does
really
surprise
me
am
i
bound
to
account
to
the
public
for
the
marriage
stipulations
which
our
notaries
think
necessary
under
the
political
circumstances
of
my
s
future
life
has
the
mania
for
public
discussion
made
its
way
into
families
ought
i
to
convoke
in
writing
the
fathers
and
mothers
of
the
province
to
come
here
and
give
their
vote
on
the
clauses
of
our
marriage
contract
a
torrent
of
epigram
flowed
over
bordeaux
madame
evangelista
was
about
to
leave
the
city
and
could
safely
scan
her
friends
and
enemies
caricature
them
and
lash
them
as
she
pleased
with
nothing
to
fear
in
return
accordingly
she
now
gave
vent
to
her
secret
observations
and
her
latent
dislikes
as
she
sought
for
the
reason
why
this
or
that
person
denied
the
shining
of
the
sun
at
but
my
dear
said
the
marquise
de
gyas
this
stay
of
the
count
at
lanstrac
these
parties
given
to
young
men
under
such
circumstances
ah
my
dear
said
the
great
lady
interrupting
the
marquise
do
you
suppose
that
we
adopt
the
pettiness
of
bourgeois
customs
is
count
paul
held
in
bonds
like
a
man
who
might
seek
to
get
away
think
you
we
ought
to
watch
him
with
a
squad
of
gendarmes
lest
some
provincial
conspiracy
should
get
him
away
from
us
be
assured
my
dearest
friend
that
it
gives
me
the
greatest
pleasure
to
here
her
words
were
interrupted
by
a
footman
who
entered
the
room
to
announce
paul
like
many
lovers
paul
thought
it
charming
to
ride
twelve
miles
to
spend
an
hour
with
natalie
he
had
left
his
friends
while
hunting
and
came
in
booted
and
spurred
and
whip
in
hand
dear
paul
said
natalie
you
don
t
know
what
an
answer
you
are
giving
to
when
paul
heard
of
the
gossip
that
was
current
in
bordeaux
he
laughed
instead
of
being
angry
these
worthy
people
have
found
out
perhaps
that
there
will
be
no
wedding
festivities
according
to
provincial
usages
no
marriage
at
in
the
church
and
they
are
furious
well
my
dear
mother
he
added
kissing
her
hand
let
us
pacify
them
with
a
ball
on
the
day
when
we
sign
the
contract
just
as
the
government
flings
a
fete
to
the
people
in
the
great
square
of
the
and
we
will
give
our
dear
friends
the
dolorous
pleasure
of
signing
a
such
as
they
have
seldom
heard
of
in
the
this
little
incident
proved
of
great
importance
madame
evangelista
invited
all
bordeaux
to
witness
the
signature
of
the
contract
and
showed
her
intention
of
displaying
in
this
last
fete
a
luxury
which
should
refute
the
foolish
lies
of
the
community
the
preparations
for
this
event
required
over
a
month
and
it
was
called
the
fete
of
the
camellias
immense
quantities
of
that
beautiful
flower
were
massed
on
the
staircase
and
in
the
antechamber
and
during
this
month
the
formalities
for
constituting
the
entail
were
concluded
in
paris
the
estates
adjoining
lanstrac
were
purchased
the
banns
were
published
and
all
doubts
finally
dissipated
friends
and
enemies
thought
only
of
preparing
their
toilets
for
the
coming
fete
the
time
occupied
by
these
events
obscured
the
difficulties
raised
by
the
first
discussion
and
swept
into
oblivion
the
words
and
arguments
of
that
stormy
conference
neither
paul
nor
his
continued
to
think
of
them
were
they
not
after
all
as
madame
evangelista
had
said
the
affair
of
the
two
notaries
but
to
whom
has
it
never
happened
when
life
is
in
its
fullest
flow
to
be
suddenly
changed
by
the
voice
of
memory
raised
perhaps
too
late
reminding
us
of
some
important
new
fact
some
threatened
danger
on
the
morning
of
the
day
when
the
contract
was
to
be
signed
and
the
fete
given
one
of
these
flashes
of
the
soul
illuminated
the
mind
of
madame
evangelista
during
the
of
her
waking
hour
the
words
that
she
herself
had
uttered
at
the
moment
when
mathias
acceded
to
solonet
s
conditions
questa
coda
non
e
di
questo
gatto
were
cried
aloud
in
her
mind
by
that
voice
of
memory
in
spite
of
her
incapacity
for
business
madame
evangelista
s
shrewdness
told
her
if
so
clever
a
notary
as
mathias
was
pacified
it
must
have
been
that
he
saw
compensation
at
the
cost
of
that
some
one
could
not
be
paul
as
she
had
blindly
hoped
could
it
be
that
her
daughter
s
fortune
was
to
pay
the
costs
of
war
she
resolved
to
demand
explanations
on
the
tenor
of
the
contract
not
reflecting
on
the
course
she
would
have
to
take
in
case
she
found
her
interests
seriously
compromised
this
day
had
so
powerful
an
influence
on
paul
de
manerville
s
conjugal
life
that
it
is
necessary
to
explain
certain
of
the
external
circumstances
which
accompanied
it
madame
evangelista
had
shrunk
from
no
expense
for
this
dazzling
fete
the
was
gravelled
and
converted
into
a
tent
and
filled
with
shrubs
although
it
was
winter
the
camellias
of
which
so
much
had
been
said
from
angouleme
to
dax
were
banked
on
the
staircase
and
in
the
vestibules
wall
partitions
had
disappeared
to
enlarge
the
and
the
where
the
dancing
was
to
be
bordeaux
a
city
famous
for
the
luxury
of
colonial
fortunes
was
on
a
tiptoe
of
expectation
for
this
scene
of
fairyland
about
eight
o
clock
as
the
last
discussion
of
the
contract
was
taking
place
within
the
house
the
inquisitive
populace
anxious
to
see
the
ladies
in
full
dress
getting
out
of
their
carriages
formed
in
two
hedges
on
either
side
of
the
thus
the
sumptuous
atmosphere
of
a
fete
acted
upon
all
minds
at
the
moment
when
the
contract
was
being
signed
illuminating
colored
lamps
lighted
up
the
shrubs
and
the
wheels
of
the
arriving
guests
echoed
from
the
the
two
notaries
had
dined
with
the
bridal
pair
and
their
mother
mathias
s
whose
business
it
was
to
receive
the
signatures
of
the
guests
during
the
evening
taking
due
care
that
the
contract
was
not
surreptitiously
read
by
the
signers
was
also
present
at
the
dinner
no
bridal
toilet
was
ever
comparable
with
that
of
natalie
whose
beauty
decked
with
laces
and
satin
her
hair
coquettishly
falling
in
a
myriad
of
curls
about
her
throat
resembled
that
of
a
flower
encased
in
its
foliage
madame
evangelista
robed
in
a
gown
of
cherry
velvet
a
color
judiciously
chosen
to
heighten
the
brilliancy
of
her
skin
and
her
black
hair
and
eyes
glowed
with
the
beauty
of
a
woman
at
forty
and
wore
her
pearl
necklace
clasped
with
the
discreto
a
visible
contradiction
to
the
late
calumnies
to
fully
explain
this
scene
it
is
necessary
to
say
that
paul
and
natalie
sat
together
on
a
sofa
beside
the
fireplace
and
paid
no
attention
to
the
reading
of
the
documents
equally
childish
and
equally
happy
regarding
life
as
a
cloudless
sky
rich
young
and
loving
they
chattered
to
each
other
in
a
low
voice
sinking
into
whispers
arming
his
love
with
the
presence
of
legality
paul
took
delight
in
kissing
the
tips
of
natalie
s
fingers
in
lightly
touching
her
snowy
shoulders
and
the
waving
curls
of
her
hair
hiding
from
the
eyes
of
others
these
joys
of
illegal
emancipation
natalie
played
with
a
screen
of
peacock
s
feathers
given
to
her
by
paul
a
gift
which
is
to
love
according
to
superstitious
belief
in
certain
countries
as
dangerous
an
omen
as
the
gift
of
scissors
or
other
cutting
instruments
which
recall
no
doubt
the
parces
of
antiquity
seated
beside
the
two
notaries
madame
evangelista
gave
her
closest
attention
to
the
reading
of
the
documents
after
listening
to
the
guardianship
account
most
ably
written
out
by
solonet
in
which
natalie
s
share
of
the
three
million
and
more
francs
left
by
monsieur
evangelista
was
shown
to
be
the
eleven
hundred
and
thousand
madame
evangelista
said
to
the
heedless
young
couple
come
listen
listen
my
children
this
is
your
marriage
the
clerk
drank
a
glass
of
solonet
and
mathias
blew
their
noses
paul
and
natalie
looked
at
the
four
personages
before
them
listened
to
the
preamble
and
returned
to
their
chatter
the
statement
of
the
property
brought
by
each
party
the
general
deed
of
gift
in
the
event
of
death
without
issue
the
deed
of
gift
of
in
and
in
capital
without
interest
allowed
by
the
code
whatever
be
the
number
of
the
children
the
constitution
of
a
common
fund
for
husband
and
wife
the
settlement
of
the
diamonds
on
the
wife
the
library
and
horses
on
the
husband
were
duly
read
and
passed
without
observations
then
followed
the
constitution
of
the
entail
when
all
was
read
and
nothing
remained
but
to
sign
the
contract
madame
evangelista
demanded
to
know
what
would
be
the
ultimate
effect
of
the
entail
an
entail
madam
replied
solonet
means
an
inalienable
right
to
the
inheritance
of
certain
property
belonging
to
both
husband
and
wife
which
is
settled
from
generation
to
generation
on
the
eldest
son
of
the
house
without
however
depriving
him
of
his
right
to
share
in
the
division
of
the
rest
of
the
what
will
be
the
effect
of
this
on
my
daughter
s
rights
maitre
mathias
incapable
of
disguising
the
truth
replied
madame
an
entail
being
an
appanage
or
portion
of
property
set
aside
for
this
purpose
from
the
fortunes
of
husband
and
wife
it
follows
that
if
the
wife
dies
first
leaving
several
children
one
of
them
a
son
monsieur
de
manerville
will
owe
those
children
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
only
from
which
he
will
deduct
his
fourth
in
and
his
fourth
in
capital
thus
his
debt
to
those
children
will
be
reduced
to
one
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
or
thereabouts
exclusive
of
his
savings
and
profits
from
the
common
fund
constituted
for
husband
and
wife
if
on
the
contrary
he
dies
first
leaving
a
male
heir
madame
de
manerville
has
a
right
to
three
hundred
and
sixty
thousand
francs
only
and
to
her
deeds
of
gift
of
such
of
her
husband
s
property
as
is
not
included
in
the
entail
to
the
diamonds
now
settled
upon
her
and
to
her
profits
and
savings
from
the
common
the
effect
of
maitre
mathias
s
astute
and
policy
were
now
plainly
seen
my
daughter
is
ruined
said
madame
evangelista
in
a
low
voice
the
old
and
the
young
notary
both
overheard
the
words
is
it
ruin
replied
mathias
speaking
gently
to
constitute
for
her
family
an
indestructible
fortune
the
younger
notary
seeing
the
expression
of
his
client
s
face
thought
it
judicious
in
him
to
state
the
disaster
in
plain
terms
we
tried
to
trick
them
out
of
three
hundred
thousand
francs
he
whispered
to
the
angry
woman
they
have
actually
laid
hold
of
eight
hundred
thousand
it
is
a
loss
of
four
hundred
thousand
from
our
interests
for
the
benefit
of
the
children
you
must
now
either
break
the
marriage
off
at
once
or
carry
it
through
concluded
solonet
it
is
impossible
to
describe
the
moment
of
silence
that
followed
maitre
mathias
waited
in
triumph
the
signature
of
the
two
persons
who
had
expected
to
rob
his
client
natalie
not
competent
to
understand
that
she
had
lost
half
her
fortune
and
paul
ignorant
that
the
house
of
manerville
had
gained
it
were
laughing
and
chattering
still
solonet
and
madame
evangelista
gazed
at
each
other
the
one
endeavoring
to
conceal
his
indifference
the
other
repressing
the
rush
of
a
crowd
of
bitter
feelings
after
suffering
in
her
own
mind
the
struggles
of
remorse
after
blaming
paul
as
the
cause
of
her
dishonesty
madame
evangelista
had
decided
to
employ
those
shameful
manoeuvres
to
cast
on
him
the
burden
of
her
own
unfaithful
guardianship
considering
him
her
victim
but
now
in
a
moment
she
perceived
that
where
she
thought
she
triumphed
she
was
about
to
perish
and
her
victim
was
her
own
daughter
guilty
without
profit
she
saw
herself
the
dupe
of
an
honorable
old
man
whose
respect
she
had
doubtless
lost
her
secret
conduct
must
have
inspired
the
stipulation
of
old
mathias
and
mathias
must
have
enlightened
paul
horrible
reflection
even
if
he
had
not
yet
done
so
as
soon
as
that
contract
was
signed
the
old
wolf
would
surely
warn
his
client
of
the
dangers
he
had
run
and
had
now
escaped
were
it
only
to
receive
the
praise
of
his
sagacity
he
would
put
him
on
his
guard
against
the
wily
woman
who
had
lowered
herself
to
this
conspiracy
he
would
destroy
the
empire
she
had
conquered
over
her
feeble
natures
once
warned
turn
obstinate
and
are
never
won
again
at
the
first
discussion
of
the
contract
she
had
reckoned
on
paul
s
weakness
and
on
the
impossibility
he
would
feel
of
breaking
off
a
marriage
so
far
advanced
but
now
she
herself
was
far
more
tightly
bound
three
months
earlier
paul
had
no
real
obstacles
to
prevent
the
rupture
now
all
bordeaux
knew
that
the
notaries
had
smoothed
the
difficulties
the
banns
were
published
the
wedding
was
to
take
place
immediately
the
friends
of
both
families
were
at
that
moment
arriving
for
the
fete
and
to
witness
the
contract
how
could
she
postpone
the
marriage
at
this
late
hour
the
cause
of
the
rupture
would
surely
be
made
known
maitre
mathias
s
stern
honor
was
too
well
known
in
bordeaux
his
word
would
be
believed
in
preference
to
hers
the
scoffers
would
turn
against
her
and
against
her
daughter
no
she
could
not
break
it
off
she
must
yield
these
reflections
so
cruelly
sound
fell
upon
madame
evangelista
s
brain
like
a
and
split
it
though
she
still
maintained
the
dignity
and
reserve
of
a
diplomatist
her
chin
was
shaken
by
that
apoplectic
movement
which
showed
the
anger
of
catherine
the
second
on
the
famous
day
when
seated
on
her
throne
and
in
presence
of
her
court
very
much
in
the
present
circumstances
of
madame
evangelista
she
was
braved
by
the
king
of
sweden
solonet
observed
that
play
of
the
muscles
which
revealed
the
birth
of
a
mortal
hatred
a
lurid
storm
to
which
there
was
no
lightning
at
this
moment
madame
evangelista
vowed
to
her
one
of
those
unquenchable
hatreds
the
seeds
of
which
were
left
by
the
moors
in
the
atmosphere
of
spain
monsieur
she
said
bending
to
the
ear
of
her
notary
you
called
that
stipulation
balderdash
it
seems
to
me
that
nothing
could
have
been
more
madame
allow
me
monsieur
she
continued
paying
no
heed
to
his
interruption
if
you
did
not
perceive
the
effect
of
that
entail
at
the
time
of
our
first
conference
it
is
very
extraordinary
that
it
did
not
occur
to
you
in
the
silence
of
your
study
this
can
hardly
be
the
young
notary
drew
his
client
into
the
next
room
saying
to
himself
as
he
did
so
i
get
a
franc
fee
for
the
guardianship
account
three
thousand
for
the
contract
six
thousand
on
the
sale
of
the
house
fifteen
thousand
in
all
better
not
be
he
closed
the
door
cast
on
madame
evangelista
the
cool
look
of
a
business
man
and
said
madame
having
for
your
sake
passed
as
i
did
the
proper
limits
of
legal
craft
do
you
seriously
intend
to
reward
my
devotion
by
such
language
but
monsieur
madame
i
did
not
it
is
true
calculate
the
effect
of
the
deeds
of
gift
but
if
you
do
not
wish
comte
paul
for
your
you
are
not
obliged
to
accept
him
the
contract
is
not
signed
give
your
fete
and
postpone
the
signing
it
is
far
better
to
brave
bordeaux
than
sacrifice
how
can
i
justify
such
a
course
to
society
which
is
already
prejudiced
against
us
by
the
slow
conclusion
of
the
marriage
by
some
error
committed
in
paris
some
missing
document
not
sent
with
the
rest
replied
solonet
but
those
purchases
of
land
near
lanstrac
monsieur
de
manerville
will
be
at
no
loss
to
find
another
bride
and
another
yes
he
ll
lose
nothing
but
we
lose
all
all
you
replied
solonet
why
you
can
easily
find
another
count
who
will
cost
you
less
money
if
a
title
is
the
chief
object
of
this
no
no
we
can
t
stake
our
honor
in
that
way
i
am
caught
in
a
trap
monsieur
all
bordeaux
will
ring
with
this
our
solemn
words
are
pledged
you
wish
the
happiness
of
mademoiselle
above
all
to
be
happy
in
france
said
the
notary
means
being
mistress
of
the
home
she
can
lead
that
fool
of
a
manerville
by
the
nose
if
she
chooses
he
is
so
dull
he
has
actually
seen
nothing
of
all
this
even
if
he
now
distrusts
you
he
will
always
trust
his
wife
and
his
wife
is
you
is
she
not
the
count
s
fate
is
still
within
your
power
if
you
choose
to
play
the
cards
in
your
if
that
were
true
monsieur
i
know
not
what
i
would
not
do
to
show
my
gratitude
she
said
in
a
transport
of
feeling
that
colored
her
cheeks
let
us
now
return
to
the
others
madame
said
solonet
listen
carefully
to
what
i
shall
say
and
then
you
shall
think
me
incapable
if
you
my
dear
friend
said
the
young
notary
to
maitre
mathias
in
spite
of
your
great
ability
you
have
not
foreseen
either
the
case
of
monsieur
de
manerville
dying
without
children
nor
that
in
which
he
leaves
only
female
issue
in
either
of
those
cases
the
entail
would
pass
to
the
manervilles
or
at
any
rate
give
rise
to
suits
on
their
part
i
think
therefore
it
is
necessary
to
stipulate
that
in
the
first
case
the
entailed
property
shall
pass
under
the
general
deed
of
gift
between
husband
and
wife
and
in
the
second
case
that
the
entail
shall
be
declared
void
this
agreement
concerns
the
wife
s
both
clauses
seem
to
me
perfectly
just
said
maitre
mathias
as
to
their
ratification
monsieur
le
comte
can
doubtless
come
to
an
understanding
with
the
chancellor
if
solonet
took
a
pen
and
added
this
momentous
clause
on
the
margin
of
the
contract
paul
and
natalie
paid
no
attention
to
the
matter
but
madame
evangelista
dropped
her
eyes
while
maitre
mathias
read
the
added
sentence
aloud
we
will
now
sign
said
the
mother
the
volume
of
voice
which
madame
evangelista
repressed
as
she
uttered
those
words
betrayed
her
violent
emotion
she
was
thinking
to
herself
no
my
daughter
shall
not
be
ruined
but
he
my
daughter
shall
have
the
name
the
title
and
the
fortune
if
she
should
some
day
discover
that
she
does
not
love
him
that
she
loves
another
irresistibly
paul
shall
be
driven
out
of
france
my
daughter
shall
be
free
and
happy
and
if
maitre
mathias
understood
how
to
analyze
business
interests
he
knew
little
of
the
analysis
of
human
passions
he
accepted
madame
evangelista
s
words
as
an
honorable
amende
instead
of
judging
them
for
what
they
were
a
declaration
of
war
while
solonet
and
his
clerk
superintended
natalie
as
she
signed
the
documents
an
operation
which
took
time
mathias
took
paul
aside
and
told
him
the
meaning
of
the
stipulation
by
which
he
had
saved
him
from
ultimate
pain
the
whole
affair
is
now
en
i
hold
the
documents
but
the
contract
contains
a
rescript
for
the
diamonds
you
must
ask
for
them
business
is
business
diamonds
are
going
up
just
now
but
may
go
down
the
purchase
of
those
new
domains
justifies
you
in
turning
everything
into
money
that
you
can
therefore
monsieur
le
comte
have
no
false
modesty
in
this
matter
the
first
payment
is
due
after
the
formalities
are
over
the
sum
is
two
hundred
thousand
francs
put
the
diamonds
into
that
you
have
the
lien
on
this
house
which
will
be
sold
at
once
and
will
pay
the
rest
if
you
have
the
courage
to
spend
only
fifty
thousand
francs
for
the
next
three
years
you
can
save
the
two
hundred
thousand
francs
you
are
now
obliged
to
pay
if
you
plant
vineyards
on
your
new
estates
you
can
get
an
income
of
over
thousand
francs
upon
them
you
may
be
said
in
short
to
have
made
a
good
paul
pressed
the
hand
of
his
old
friend
very
affectionately
a
gesture
which
did
not
escape
madame
evangelista
who
now
came
forward
to
offer
him
the
pen
suspicion
became
certainty
to
her
mind
she
was
confident
that
paul
and
mathias
had
come
to
an
understanding
about
her
rage
and
hatred
sent
the
blood
surging
through
her
veins
to
her
heart
the
worst
had
come
after
verifying
that
all
the
documents
were
duly
signed
and
the
initials
of
the
parties
affixed
to
the
bottom
of
the
leaves
maitre
mathias
looked
from
paul
to
his
and
seeing
that
his
client
did
not
intend
to
speak
of
the
diamonds
he
said
i
do
not
suppose
there
can
be
any
doubt
about
the
transfer
of
the
diamonds
as
you
are
now
one
it
would
be
more
regular
if
madame
evangelista
made
them
over
now
as
monsieur
de
manerville
has
become
responsible
for
the
guardianship
funds
and
we
never
know
who
may
live
or
die
said
solonet
who
thought
he
saw
in
this
circumstance
fresh
cause
of
anger
in
the
against
the
ah
mother
cried
paul
it
would
be
insulting
to
us
all
to
do
that
summum
jus
summum
injuria
monsieur
he
said
to
solonet
and
i
said
madame
evangelista
led
by
the
hatred
now
surging
in
her
heart
to
see
a
direct
insult
to
her
in
the
indirect
appeal
of
maitre
mathias
i
will
tear
that
contract
up
if
you
do
not
take
she
left
the
room
in
one
of
those
furious
passions
which
long
for
the
power
to
destroy
everything
and
which
the
sense
of
impotence
drives
almost
to
madness
for
heaven
s
sake
take
them
paul
whispered
natalie
in
his
ear
my
mother
is
angry
i
shall
know
why
and
i
will
tell
you
we
must
pacify
calmed
by
this
first
outburst
madame
kept
the
necklace
and
which
she
was
wearing
and
brought
the
other
jewels
valued
at
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
by
elie
magus
accustomed
to
the
sight
of
family
diamonds
in
all
valuations
of
inheritance
maitre
mathias
and
solonet
examined
these
jewels
in
their
cases
and
exclaimed
upon
their
duty
you
will
lose
nothing
after
all
upon
the
dot
monsieur
le
comte
said
solonet
bringing
the
color
to
paul
s
face
yes
said
mathias
these
jewels
will
meet
the
first
payment
on
the
purchase
of
the
new
and
the
costs
of
the
contract
added
solonet
hatred
feeds
like
love
on
little
things
the
least
thing
strengthens
it
as
one
beloved
can
do
no
evil
so
the
person
hated
can
do
no
good
madame
evangelista
assigned
to
hypocrisy
the
natural
embarrassment
of
paul
who
was
unwilling
to
take
the
jewels
and
not
knowing
where
to
put
the
cases
longed
to
fling
them
from
the
window
madame
evangelista
spurred
him
with
a
glance
which
seemed
to
say
take
your
property
from
dear
natalie
said
paul
put
away
these
jewels
they
are
yours
i
give
them
to
natalie
locked
them
into
the
drawer
of
a
console
at
this
instant
the
noise
of
the
carriages
in
the
and
the
murmur
of
voices
in
the
became
so
loud
that
natalie
and
her
mother
were
forced
to
appear
the
salons
were
filled
in
a
few
moments
and
the
fete
began
profit
by
the
honeymoon
to
sell
those
diamonds
said
the
old
notary
to
paul
as
he
went
away
while
waiting
for
the
dancing
to
begin
whispers
went
round
about
the
marriage
and
doubts
were
expressed
as
to
the
future
of
the
promised
couple
is
it
finally
arranged
said
one
of
the
leading
personages
of
the
town
to
madame
evangelista
we
had
so
many
documents
to
read
and
sign
that
i
fear
we
are
rather
late
she
replied
but
perhaps
we
are
as
for
me
i
heard
nothing
said
natalie
giving
her
hand
to
her
lover
to
open
the
ball
both
of
those
young
persons
are
extravagant
and
the
mother
is
not
of
a
kind
to
check
them
said
a
dowager
but
they
have
founded
an
entail
i
am
told
worth
fifty
thousand
francs
a
pooh
in
that
i
see
the
hand
of
our
worthy
monsieur
mathias
said
a
magistrate
if
it
is
really
true
he
has
done
it
to
save
the
future
of
the
natalie
is
too
handsome
not
to
be
horribly
coquettish
after
a
couple
of
years
of
marriage
said
one
young
woman
i
wouldn
t
answer
for
monsieur
de
manerville
s
happiness
in
his
the
pink
of
fashion
will
then
need
staking
said
solonet
laughing
don
t
you
think
madame
evangelista
looks
annoyed
asked
another
but
my
dear
i
have
just
been
told
that
all
she
is
able
to
keep
is
thousand
francs
a
year
and
what
is
that
to
her
penury
yes
she
has
robbed
herself
for
natalie
monsieur
de
manerville
has
been
so
exacting
extremely
exacting
put
in
maitre
solonet
but
before
long
he
will
be
peer
of
france
the
maulincours
and
the
vidame
de
pamiers
will
use
their
influence
he
belongs
to
the
faubourg
oh
he
is
received
there
and
that
is
all
said
a
lady
who
had
tried
to
obtain
him
as
a
mademoiselle
evangelista
as
the
daughter
of
a
merchant
will
certainly
not
open
the
doors
of
the
of
cologne
to
him
she
is
to
the
duke
of
through
the
female
line
the
topic
was
presently
exhausted
the
went
to
the
tables
the
young
people
danced
the
supper
was
served
and
the
ball
was
not
over
till
morning
when
the
first
gleams
of
the
coming
day
whitened
the
windows
having
said
adieu
to
paul
who
was
the
last
to
go
away
madame
evangelista
went
to
her
daughter
s
room
for
her
own
had
been
taken
by
the
architect
to
enlarge
the
scene
of
the
fete
though
natalie
and
her
mother
were
overcome
with
sleep
they
said
a
few
words
to
each
other
as
soon
as
they
were
alone
tell
me
mother
dear
what
was
the
matter
with
you
my
darling
i
learned
this
evening
to
what
lengths
a
mother
s
tenderness
can
go
you
know
nothing
of
business
and
you
are
ignorant
of
the
suspicions
to
which
my
integrity
has
been
exposed
i
have
trampled
my
pride
under
foot
for
your
happiness
and
my
reputation
were
at
are
you
talking
of
the
diamonds
poor
boy
he
wept
he
did
not
want
them
i
have
sleep
now
my
child
we
will
talk
business
when
we
wake
for
she
added
sighing
you
and
i
have
business
now
another
person
has
come
between
ah
my
dear
mother
paul
will
never
be
an
obstacle
to
our
happiness
yours
and
mine
murmured
natalie
as
she
went
to
sleep
poor
darling
she
little
knows
that
the
man
has
ruined
madame
evangelista
s
soul
was
seized
at
that
moment
with
the
first
idea
of
avarice
a
vice
to
which
many
become
a
prey
as
they
grow
aged
it
came
into
her
mind
to
recover
in
her
daughter
s
interest
the
whole
of
the
property
left
by
her
husband
she
told
herself
that
her
honor
demanded
it
her
devotion
to
natalie
made
her
in
a
moment
as
shrewd
and
calculating
as
she
had
hitherto
been
careless
and
wasteful
she
resolved
to
turn
her
capital
to
account
after
investing
a
part
of
it
in
the
funds
which
were
then
selling
at
eighty
francs
a
passion
often
changes
the
whole
character
in
a
moment
an
indiscreet
person
becomes
a
diplomatist
a
coward
is
suddenly
brave
hate
made
this
prodigal
woman
a
miser
chance
and
luck
might
serve
the
project
of
vengeance
still
undefined
and
confused
which
she
would
now
mature
in
her
mind
she
fell
asleep
muttering
to
herself
by
an
unexplained
phenomenon
the
effects
of
which
are
familiar
to
all
thinkers
her
mind
during
sleep
marshalled
its
ideas
enlightened
them
classed
them
prepared
a
means
by
which
she
was
to
rule
paul
s
life
and
showed
her
a
plan
which
she
began
to
carry
out
on
that
very
chapter
the
marriage
contract
third
day
though
the
excitement
of
the
fete
had
driven
from
paul
s
mind
the
anxious
thoughts
that
now
and
then
assailed
it
when
he
was
alone
with
himself
and
in
his
bed
they
returned
to
torment
him
it
seems
to
me
he
said
to
himself
that
without
that
good
mathias
my
would
have
tricked
me
and
yet
is
that
believable
what
interest
could
lead
her
to
deceive
me
are
we
not
to
join
fortunes
and
live
together
well
well
why
should
i
worry
about
it
in
two
days
natalie
will
be
my
wife
our
money
relations
are
plainly
defined
nothing
can
come
between
us
vogue
la
galere
nevertheless
i
ll
be
upon
my
guard
suppose
mathias
was
right
well
if
he
was
i
m
not
obliged
to
marry
my
in
this
second
battle
of
the
contract
paul
s
future
had
completely
changed
in
aspect
though
he
was
not
aware
of
it
of
the
two
persons
whom
he
was
marrying
one
the
cleverest
was
now
his
mortal
enemy
and
meditated
already
withdrawing
her
interests
from
the
common
fund
incapable
of
observing
the
difference
that
a
creole
nature
placed
between
his
and
other
women
paul
was
far
from
suspecting
her
craftiness
the
creole
nature
is
apart
from
all
others
it
derives
from
europe
by
its
intellect
from
the
tropics
by
the
illogical
violence
of
its
passions
from
the
east
by
the
apathetic
indifference
with
which
it
does
or
suffers
either
good
or
evil
equally
a
graceful
nature
withal
but
dangerous
as
a
child
is
dangerous
if
not
watched
like
a
child
the
creole
woman
must
have
her
way
immediately
like
a
child
she
would
burn
a
house
to
boil
an
egg
in
her
soft
and
easy
life
she
takes
no
care
upon
her
mind
but
when
impassioned
she
thinks
of
all
things
she
has
something
of
the
perfidy
of
the
negroes
by
whom
she
has
been
surrounded
from
her
cradle
but
she
is
also
as
naive
and
even
at
times
as
artless
as
they
like
them
and
like
the
children
she
wishes
doggedly
for
one
thing
with
a
growing
intensity
of
desire
and
will
brood
upon
that
idea
until
she
hatches
it
a
strange
assemblage
of
virtues
and
defects
which
her
spanish
nature
had
strengthened
in
madame
evangelista
and
over
which
her
french
experience
had
cast
the
glaze
of
its
politeness
this
character
slumbering
in
married
happiness
for
sixteen
years
occupied
since
then
with
the
trivialities
of
social
life
this
nature
to
which
a
first
hatred
had
revealed
its
strength
awoke
now
like
a
conflagration
at
the
moment
of
the
woman
s
life
when
she
was
losing
the
dearest
object
of
her
affections
and
needed
another
element
for
the
energy
that
possessed
her
this
flame
burst
forth
natalie
could
be
but
three
days
more
beneath
her
influence
madame
evangelista
vanquished
at
other
points
had
one
clear
day
before
her
the
last
of
those
that
a
daughter
spends
beside
her
mother
a
few
words
and
the
creole
nature
could
influence
the
lives
of
the
two
beings
about
to
walk
together
through
the
brambled
paths
and
the
dusty
of
parisian
society
for
natalie
believed
in
her
mother
blindly
what
power
would
the
counsel
of
that
creole
nature
have
on
a
mind
so
subservient
the
whole
future
of
these
lives
might
be
determined
by
one
single
speech
no
code
no
human
institution
can
prevent
the
crime
that
kills
by
words
there
lies
the
weakness
of
social
law
in
that
is
the
difference
between
the
morals
of
the
great
world
and
the
morals
of
the
people
one
is
frank
the
other
hypocritical
one
employs
the
knife
the
other
the
venom
of
ideas
and
language
to
one
death
to
the
other
impunity
the
next
morning
about
madame
evangelista
was
half
seated
half
lying
on
the
edge
of
her
daughter
s
bed
during
that
waking
hour
they
caressed
and
played
together
in
happy
memory
of
their
loving
life
a
life
in
which
no
discord
had
ever
troubled
either
the
harmony
of
their
feelings
the
agreement
of
their
ideas
or
the
mutual
choice
and
enjoyment
of
their
pleasures
poor
little
darling
said
the
mother
shedding
true
tears
how
can
i
help
being
sorrowful
when
i
think
that
after
i
have
fulfilled
your
every
wish
during
your
whole
life
you
will
belong
night
to
a
man
you
must
obey
oh
my
dear
mother
as
for
obeying
and
natalie
made
a
little
motion
of
her
head
which
expressed
a
graceful
rebellion
you
are
joking
she
continued
my
father
always
gratified
your
caprices
and
why
not
he
loved
you
and
i
am
loved
yes
paul
has
a
certain
love
for
you
but
if
a
married
woman
is
not
careful
nothing
more
rapidly
evaporates
than
conjugal
love
the
influence
a
wife
ought
to
have
over
her
husband
depends
entirely
on
how
she
begins
with
him
you
need
the
best
but
you
will
be
with
possibly
my
child
last
night
while
the
ball
was
going
on
i
reflected
on
the
dangers
of
our
being
together
if
my
presence
were
to
do
you
harm
if
the
little
acts
by
which
you
ought
slowly
but
surely
to
establish
your
authority
as
a
wife
should
be
attributed
to
my
influence
your
home
would
become
a
hell
at
the
first
frown
i
saw
upon
your
husband
s
brow
i
proud
as
i
am
should
instantly
leave
his
house
if
i
were
driven
to
leave
it
better
i
think
not
to
enter
it
i
should
never
forgive
your
husband
if
he
caused
trouble
between
us
whereas
when
you
have
once
become
the
mistress
when
your
husband
is
to
you
what
your
father
was
to
me
that
danger
is
no
longer
to
be
feared
though
this
wise
policy
will
cost
your
young
and
tender
heart
a
pang
your
happiness
demands
that
you
become
the
absolute
sovereign
of
your
then
why
mamma
did
you
say
just
now
i
must
obey
him
my
dear
little
daughter
in
order
that
a
wife
may
rule
she
must
always
seem
to
do
what
her
husband
wishes
if
you
were
not
told
this
you
might
by
some
impulsive
opposition
destroy
your
future
paul
is
a
weak
young
man
he
might
allow
a
friend
to
rule
him
he
might
even
fall
under
the
dominion
of
some
woman
who
would
make
you
feel
her
influence
prevent
such
disasters
by
making
yourself
from
the
very
start
his
ruler
is
it
not
better
that
he
be
governed
by
you
than
by
others
yes
certainly
said
natalie
i
should
think
only
of
his
and
it
is
my
privilege
darling
to
think
only
of
yours
and
to
wish
not
to
leave
you
at
so
crucial
a
moment
without
a
compass
in
the
midst
of
the
reefs
through
which
you
must
but
dearest
mother
are
we
not
strong
enough
you
and
i
to
stay
together
beside
him
without
having
to
fear
those
frowns
you
seem
to
dread
paul
loves
you
oh
oh
he
fears
me
more
than
he
loves
me
observe
him
carefully
when
i
tell
him
that
i
shall
let
you
go
to
paris
without
me
and
you
will
see
on
his
face
no
matter
what
pains
he
takes
to
conceal
it
his
inward
why
should
he
feel
so
why
dear
child
i
am
like
or
i
will
tell
that
to
himself
and
before
but
suppose
i
marry
on
condition
that
you
do
not
leave
me
urged
natalie
our
separation
is
necessary
replied
her
mother
several
considerations
have
greatly
changed
my
future
i
am
now
poor
you
will
lead
a
brilliant
life
in
paris
and
i
could
not
live
with
you
suitably
without
spending
the
little
that
remains
to
me
whereas
if
i
go
to
lanstrac
i
can
take
care
of
your
property
there
and
restore
my
fortune
by
you
mamma
practise
economy
cried
natalie
laughing
don
t
begin
to
be
a
grandmother
yet
what
do
you
mean
to
leave
me
for
such
reasons
as
those
dear
mother
paul
may
seem
to
you
a
trifle
stupid
but
he
is
not
one
atom
selfish
or
ah
replied
madame
evangelista
in
a
tone
of
voice
big
with
suggestions
which
made
the
girl
s
heart
throb
those
discussions
about
the
contract
have
made
me
distrustful
i
have
my
doubts
about
him
but
don
t
be
troubled
dear
child
she
added
taking
her
daughter
by
the
neck
and
kissing
her
i
will
not
leave
you
long
alone
whenever
my
return
can
take
place
without
making
difficulty
between
you
whenever
paul
can
rightly
judge
me
we
will
begin
once
more
our
happy
little
life
our
evening
confidences
oh
mother
how
can
you
think
of
living
without
your
natalie
because
dear
angel
i
shall
live
for
her
my
mother
s
heart
will
be
satisfied
in
the
thought
that
i
contribute
as
i
ought
to
your
future
but
my
dear
adorable
mother
must
i
be
alone
with
paul
here
now
all
at
once
what
will
become
of
me
what
will
happen
what
must
i
do
what
must
i
not
do
poor
child
do
you
think
that
i
would
utterly
abandon
you
to
your
first
battle
we
will
write
to
each
other
three
times
a
week
like
lovers
we
shall
thus
be
close
to
each
other
s
hearts
incessantly
nothing
can
happen
to
you
that
i
shall
not
know
and
i
can
save
you
from
all
misfortune
besides
it
would
be
too
ridiculous
if
i
never
went
to
see
you
it
would
seem
to
show
dislike
or
disrespect
to
your
husband
i
will
always
spend
a
month
or
two
every
year
with
you
in
alone
already
alone
and
with
him
cried
natalie
in
terror
interrupting
her
mother
but
you
wish
to
be
his
wife
yes
i
wish
it
but
tell
me
how
i
should
behave
you
who
did
what
you
pleased
with
my
father
you
know
the
way
i
ll
obey
you
madame
evangelista
kissed
her
daughter
s
forehead
she
had
willed
and
awaited
this
request
child
my
counsels
must
adept
themselves
to
circumstances
all
men
are
not
alike
the
lion
and
the
frog
are
not
more
unlike
than
one
man
compared
with
another
morally
i
mean
do
i
know
what
will
happen
to
you
no
therefore
i
can
only
give
you
general
advice
upon
the
whole
tenor
of
your
dear
mother
tell
me
quick
all
that
you
know
in
the
first
place
my
dear
child
the
cause
of
the
failure
of
married
women
who
desire
to
keep
their
husbands
hearts
and
she
said
making
a
parenthesis
to
keep
their
hearts
and
rule
them
is
one
and
the
same
thing
well
the
principle
cause
of
conjugal
disunion
is
to
be
found
in
perpetual
intercourse
which
never
existed
in
the
olden
time
but
which
has
been
introduced
into
this
country
of
late
years
with
the
mania
for
family
since
the
revolution
the
manners
and
customs
of
the
bourgeois
have
invaded
the
homes
of
the
aristocracy
this
misfortune
is
due
to
one
of
their
writers
rousseau
an
infamous
heretic
whose
ideas
were
all
and
who
pretended
i
don
t
know
how
to
justify
the
most
senseless
things
he
declared
that
all
women
had
the
same
rights
and
the
same
faculties
that
living
in
a
state
of
society
we
ought
nevertheless
to
obey
nature
as
if
the
wife
of
a
spanish
grandee
as
if
you
or
i
had
anything
in
common
with
the
women
of
the
people
since
then
women
have
suckled
their
children
have
educated
their
daughters
and
stayed
in
their
own
homes
life
has
become
so
involved
that
happiness
is
almost
impossible
for
a
perfect
harmony
between
natures
such
as
that
which
has
made
you
and
me
live
as
two
friends
is
an
exception
perpetual
contact
is
as
dangerous
for
parents
and
children
as
it
is
for
husband
and
wife
there
are
few
souls
in
which
love
survives
this
fatal
omnipresence
therefore
i
say
erect
between
yourself
and
paul
the
barriers
of
society
go
to
balls
and
operas
go
out
in
the
morning
dine
out
in
the
evenings
pay
visits
constantly
and
grant
but
little
of
your
time
to
your
husband
by
this
means
you
will
always
keep
your
value
to
him
when
two
beings
bound
together
for
life
have
nothing
to
live
upon
but
sentiment
its
resources
are
soon
exhausted
indifference
satiety
and
disgust
succeed
when
sentiment
has
withered
what
will
become
of
you
remember
affection
once
extinguished
can
lead
to
nothing
but
indifference
or
contempt
be
ever
young
and
ever
new
to
him
he
may
weary
you
that
often
happens
but
you
must
never
weary
him
the
faculty
of
being
bored
without
showing
it
is
a
condition
of
all
species
of
power
you
can
not
diversify
happiness
by
the
cares
of
property
or
the
occupations
of
a
family
if
you
do
not
make
your
husband
share
your
social
interests
if
you
do
not
keep
him
amused
you
will
fall
into
a
dismal
apathy
then
begins
the
spleen
of
love
but
a
man
will
always
love
the
woman
who
amuses
him
and
keeps
him
happy
to
give
happiness
and
to
receive
it
are
two
lines
of
feminine
conduct
which
are
separated
by
a
dear
mother
i
am
listening
to
you
but
i
don
t
understand
one
word
you
if
you
love
paul
to
the
extent
of
doing
all
he
asks
of
you
if
you
make
your
happiness
depend
on
him
all
is
over
with
your
future
life
you
will
never
be
mistress
of
your
home
and
the
best
precepts
in
the
world
will
do
you
no
that
is
plainer
but
i
see
the
rule
without
knowing
how
to
apply
it
said
natalie
laughing
i
have
the
theory
the
practice
will
my
poor
ninie
replied
the
mother
who
dropped
an
honest
tear
at
the
thought
of
her
daughter
s
marriage
things
will
happen
to
teach
it
to
you
and
she
continued
after
a
pause
during
which
the
mother
and
daughter
held
each
other
closely
embraced
in
the
truest
sympathy
remember
this
my
natalie
we
all
have
our
destiny
as
women
just
as
men
have
their
vocation
as
men
a
woman
is
born
to
be
a
woman
of
the
world
and
a
charming
hostess
as
a
man
is
born
to
be
a
general
or
a
poet
your
vocation
is
to
please
your
education
has
formed
you
for
society
in
these
days
women
should
be
educated
for
the
salon
as
they
once
were
for
the
gynoecium
you
were
not
born
to
be
the
mother
of
a
family
or
the
steward
of
a
household
if
you
have
children
i
hope
they
will
not
come
to
spoil
your
figure
on
the
morrow
of
your
marriage
nothing
is
so
bourgeois
as
to
have
a
child
at
once
if
you
have
them
two
or
three
years
after
your
marriage
well
and
good
governesses
and
tutors
will
bring
them
up
you
are
to
be
the
lady
the
great
lady
who
represents
the
luxury
and
the
pleasure
of
the
house
but
remember
one
thing
let
your
superiority
be
visible
in
those
things
only
which
flatter
a
man
s
hide
the
superiority
you
must
also
acquire
over
him
in
great
but
you
frighten
me
mamma
cried
natalie
how
can
i
remember
all
these
precepts
how
shall
i
ever
manage
i
such
a
child
and
so
heedless
to
reflect
and
calculate
before
i
act
but
my
dear
little
girl
i
am
telling
you
that
which
you
must
surely
learn
later
buying
your
experience
by
fatal
faults
and
errors
of
conduct
which
will
cause
you
bitter
regrets
and
embarrass
your
whole
but
how
must
i
begin
asked
natalie
artlessly
instinct
will
guide
you
replied
her
mother
at
this
moment
paul
desires
you
more
than
he
loves
you
for
love
born
of
desires
is
a
hope
the
love
that
succeeds
their
satisfaction
is
the
reality
there
my
dear
is
the
question
there
lies
your
power
what
woman
is
not
loved
before
marriage
be
so
on
the
morrow
and
you
shall
remain
so
always
paul
is
a
weak
man
who
is
easily
trained
to
habit
if
he
yields
to
you
once
he
will
yield
always
a
woman
ardently
desired
can
ask
all
things
do
not
commit
the
folly
of
many
women
who
do
not
see
the
importance
of
the
first
hours
of
their
sway
that
of
wasting
your
power
on
trifles
on
silly
things
with
no
result
use
the
empire
your
husband
s
first
emotions
give
you
to
accustom
him
to
obedience
and
when
you
make
him
yield
choose
that
it
be
on
some
unreasonable
point
so
as
to
test
the
measure
of
your
power
by
the
measure
of
his
concession
what
victory
would
there
be
in
making
him
agree
to
a
reasonable
thing
would
that
be
obeying
you
we
must
always
as
the
castilian
proverb
says
take
the
bull
by
the
horns
when
a
bull
has
once
seen
the
inutility
of
his
defence
and
of
his
strength
he
is
beaten
when
your
husband
does
a
foolish
thing
for
you
you
can
govern
why
so
because
my
child
marriage
lasts
a
lifetime
and
a
husband
is
not
a
man
like
other
men
therefore
never
commit
the
folly
of
giving
yourself
into
his
power
in
everything
keep
up
a
constant
reserve
in
your
speech
and
in
your
actions
you
may
even
be
cold
to
him
without
danger
for
you
can
modify
coldness
at
will
besides
nothing
is
more
easy
to
maintain
than
our
dignity
the
words
it
is
not
becoming
in
your
wife
to
do
thus
and
so
is
a
great
talisman
the
life
of
a
woman
lies
in
the
words
i
will
they
are
the
final
argument
feminine
power
is
in
them
and
therefore
they
should
only
be
used
on
real
occasions
but
they
constitute
a
means
of
governing
far
beyond
that
of
argument
or
discussion
i
my
dear
child
reigned
over
your
father
by
his
faith
in
me
if
your
husband
believes
in
you
you
can
do
all
things
with
him
to
inspire
that
belief
you
must
make
him
think
that
you
understand
him
do
not
suppose
that
that
is
an
easy
thing
to
do
a
woman
can
always
make
a
man
think
that
he
is
loved
but
to
make
him
admit
that
he
is
understood
is
far
more
difficult
i
am
bound
to
tell
you
all
now
my
child
for
life
with
its
complications
life
with
two
wills
which
be
made
one
begins
for
you
bear
in
mind
at
all
moments
that
difficulty
the
only
means
of
harmonizing
your
two
wills
is
to
arrange
from
the
first
that
there
shall
be
but
one
and
that
will
must
be
yours
many
persons
declare
that
a
wife
creates
her
own
unhappiness
by
changing
sides
in
this
way
but
my
dear
she
can
only
become
the
mistress
by
controlling
events
instead
of
bearing
them
and
that
advantage
compensates
for
any
natalie
kissed
her
mother
s
hands
with
tears
of
gratitude
like
all
women
in
whom
mental
emotion
is
never
warmed
by
physical
emotion
she
suddenly
comprehended
the
bearings
of
this
feminine
policy
but
like
a
spoiled
child
that
never
admits
the
force
of
reason
and
returns
obstinately
to
its
one
desire
she
came
back
to
the
charge
with
one
of
those
personal
arguments
which
the
logic
of
a
child
suggests
dear
mamma
she
said
it
is
only
a
few
days
since
you
were
talking
of
paul
s
advancement
and
saying
that
you
alone
could
promote
it
why
then
do
you
suddenly
turn
round
and
abandon
us
to
ourselves
i
did
not
then
know
the
extent
of
my
obligations
nor
the
amount
of
my
debts
replied
the
mother
who
would
not
suffer
her
real
motive
to
be
seen
besides
a
year
or
two
hence
i
can
take
up
that
matter
again
come
let
us
dress
paul
will
be
here
soon
be
as
sweet
and
caressing
as
you
were
you
know
that
night
when
we
first
discussed
this
fatal
contract
for
we
must
save
the
last
fragments
of
our
fortune
and
i
must
win
for
you
a
thing
to
which
i
am
superstitiously
what
is
it
the
paul
arrived
about
four
o
clock
though
he
endeavored
to
meet
his
with
a
gracious
look
upon
his
face
madame
evangelista
saw
traces
of
the
clouds
which
the
counsels
of
the
night
and
the
reflections
of
the
morning
had
brought
there
mathias
has
told
him
she
thought
resolving
to
defeat
the
old
notary
s
action
my
dear
son
she
said
you
left
your
diamonds
in
the
drawer
of
the
console
and
i
frankly
confess
that
i
would
rather
not
see
again
the
things
that
threatened
to
bring
a
cloud
between
us
besides
as
monsieur
mathias
said
they
ought
to
be
sold
at
once
to
meet
the
first
payment
on
the
estates
you
have
they
are
not
mine
he
said
i
have
given
them
to
natalie
and
when
you
see
them
upon
her
you
will
forget
the
pain
they
caused
madame
evangelista
took
his
hand
and
pressed
it
cordially
with
a
tear
of
emotion
listen
to
me
my
dear
children
she
said
looking
from
paul
to
natalie
since
you
really
feel
thus
i
have
a
proposition
to
make
to
both
of
you
i
find
myself
obliged
to
sell
my
pearl
necklace
and
my
earrings
yes
paul
it
is
necessary
i
do
not
choose
to
put
a
penny
of
my
fortune
into
an
annuity
i
know
what
i
owe
to
you
well
i
admit
a
weakness
to
sell
the
discreto
seems
to
me
a
disaster
to
sell
a
diamond
which
bears
the
name
of
philip
the
second
and
once
adorned
his
royal
hand
an
historic
stone
which
the
duke
of
alba
touched
for
ten
years
in
the
hilt
of
his
sword
no
no
i
can
not
elie
magus
estimates
my
necklace
and
at
a
hundred
and
some
odd
thousand
francs
without
the
clasps
will
you
exchange
the
other
jewels
i
made
over
to
you
for
these
you
will
gain
by
the
transaction
but
what
of
that
i
am
not
selfish
instead
of
those
mere
fancy
jewels
paul
your
wife
will
have
fine
diamonds
which
she
can
really
enjoy
isn
t
it
better
that
i
should
sell
those
ornaments
which
will
surely
go
out
of
fashion
and
that
you
should
keep
in
the
family
these
priceless
stones
but
my
dear
mother
consider
yourself
said
paul
i
replied
madame
evangelista
i
want
such
things
no
longer
yes
paul
i
am
going
to
be
your
bailiff
at
lanstrac
it
would
be
folly
in
me
to
go
to
paris
at
the
moment
when
i
ought
to
be
here
to
liquidate
my
property
and
settle
my
affairs
i
shall
grow
miserly
for
my
dear
mother
said
paul
much
moved
ought
i
to
accept
this
exchange
without
paying
you
the
difference
good
heavens
are
you
not
both
of
you
my
dearest
interests
do
you
suppose
i
shall
not
find
happiness
in
thinking
as
i
sit
in
my
natalie
is
dazzling
at
the
duchesse
de
berry
s
ball
when
she
sees
my
diamond
at
her
throat
and
my
in
her
ears
she
will
have
one
of
those
little
enjoyments
of
vanity
which
contribute
so
much
to
a
woman
s
happiness
and
make
her
so
gay
and
fascinating
nothing
saddens
a
woman
more
than
to
have
her
vanity
repressed
i
have
never
seen
an
woman
who
was
amiable
or
heavens
what
was
mathias
thinking
about
thought
paul
well
then
mamma
he
said
in
a
low
voice
i
but
i
am
confounded
said
natalie
at
this
moment
solonet
arrived
to
announce
the
good
news
that
he
had
found
among
the
speculators
of
bordeaux
two
contractors
who
were
much
attracted
by
the
house
the
gardens
of
which
could
be
covered
with
dwellings
they
offer
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
he
said
but
if
you
consent
to
the
sale
i
can
make
them
give
you
three
hundred
thousand
there
are
three
acres
of
land
in
the
my
husband
paid
two
hundred
thousand
for
the
place
therefore
i
consent
she
replied
but
you
must
reserve
the
furniture
and
the
ah
said
solonet
you
are
beginning
to
understand
alas
i
must
she
said
sighing
i
am
told
that
a
great
many
persons
are
coming
to
your
midnight
service
said
solonet
perceiving
that
his
presence
was
inopportune
and
preparing
to
go
madame
evangelista
accompanied
him
to
the
door
of
the
last
salon
and
there
she
said
in
a
low
voice
i
now
have
personal
property
to
the
amount
of
two
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
if
i
can
get
two
hundred
thousand
for
my
share
of
the
house
it
will
make
a
handsome
capital
which
i
shall
want
to
invest
to
the
very
best
advantage
i
count
on
you
for
that
i
shall
probably
live
at
the
young
notary
kissed
his
client
s
hand
with
a
gesture
of
gratitude
for
the
widow
s
tone
of
voice
made
solonet
fancy
that
this
alliance
really
made
from
only
might
extend
a
little
farther
you
can
count
on
me
he
replied
i
can
find
you
investments
in
merchandise
on
which
you
will
risk
nothing
and
make
very
considerable
adieu
until
she
said
you
are
to
be
our
witness
you
know
with
monsieur
le
marquis
de
my
dear
mother
said
paul
when
she
returned
to
them
why
do
you
refuse
to
come
to
paris
natalie
is
provoked
with
me
as
if
i
were
the
cause
of
your
i
have
thought
it
all
over
my
children
and
i
am
sure
that
i
should
hamper
you
you
would
feel
obliged
to
make
me
a
third
in
all
you
did
and
young
people
have
ideas
of
their
own
which
i
might
unintentionally
thwart
go
to
paris
i
do
not
wish
to
exercise
over
the
comtesse
de
manerville
the
gentle
authority
i
have
held
over
natalie
i
desire
to
leave
her
wholly
to
you
don
t
you
see
paul
that
there
are
habits
and
ways
between
us
which
must
be
broken
up
my
influence
ought
to
yield
to
yours
i
want
you
to
love
me
and
to
believe
that
i
have
your
interests
more
at
heart
than
you
think
for
young
husbands
are
sooner
or
later
jealous
for
the
love
of
a
wife
for
her
mother
perhaps
they
are
right
when
you
are
thoroughly
united
when
love
has
blended
your
two
souls
into
one
then
my
dear
son
you
will
not
fear
an
opposing
influence
if
i
live
in
your
house
i
know
the
world
and
men
and
things
i
have
seen
the
peace
of
many
a
home
destroyed
by
the
blind
love
of
mothers
who
made
themselves
in
the
end
as
intolerable
to
their
daughters
as
to
their
the
affection
of
old
people
is
often
exacting
and
querulous
perhaps
i
could
not
efface
myself
as
i
should
i
have
the
weakness
to
think
myself
still
handsome
i
have
flatterers
who
declare
that
i
am
still
agreeable
i
should
have
i
fear
certain
pretensions
which
might
interfere
with
your
lives
let
me
therefore
make
one
more
sacrifice
for
your
happiness
i
have
given
you
my
fortune
and
now
i
desire
to
resign
to
you
my
last
vanities
as
a
woman
your
notary
mathias
is
getting
old
he
can
not
look
after
your
estates
as
i
will
i
will
be
your
bailiff
i
will
create
for
myself
those
natural
occupations
which
are
the
pleasures
of
old
age
later
if
necessary
i
will
come
to
you
in
paris
and
second
you
in
your
projects
of
ambition
come
paul
be
frank
my
proposal
suits
you
does
it
not
paul
would
not
admit
it
but
he
was
at
heart
delighted
to
get
his
liberty
the
suspicions
which
mathias
had
put
into
his
mind
respecting
his
were
however
dissipated
by
this
conversation
which
madame
evangelista
carried
on
still
longer
in
the
same
tone
my
mother
was
right
thought
natalie
who
had
watched
paul
s
countenance
he
glad
to
know
that
i
am
separated
from
her
why
that
why
was
the
first
note
of
a
rising
distrust
did
it
prove
the
power
of
those
maternal
instructions
there
are
certain
characters
which
on
the
faith
of
a
single
proof
believe
in
friendship
to
persons
thus
constituted
the
north
wind
drives
away
the
clouds
as
rapidly
as
the
south
wind
brings
them
they
stop
at
effects
and
never
hark
back
to
causes
paul
had
one
of
those
essentially
confiding
natures
without
but
also
without
foresight
his
weakness
proceeded
far
more
from
his
kindness
his
belief
in
goodness
than
from
actual
debility
of
soul
natalie
was
sad
and
thoughtful
for
she
knew
not
what
to
do
without
her
mother
paul
with
that
conceit
which
comes
of
love
smiled
to
himself
at
her
sadness
thinking
how
soon
the
pleasures
of
marriage
and
the
excitements
of
paris
would
drive
it
away
madame
evangelista
saw
this
confidence
with
much
satisfaction
she
had
already
taken
two
great
steps
her
daughter
possessed
the
diamonds
which
had
cost
paul
two
hundred
thousand
francs
and
she
had
gained
her
point
of
leaving
these
two
children
to
themselves
with
no
other
guide
than
their
illogical
love
her
revenge
was
thus
preparing
unknown
to
her
daughter
who
would
sooner
or
later
become
its
accomplice
did
natalie
love
paul
that
was
a
question
still
undecided
the
answer
to
which
might
modify
her
projects
for
she
loved
her
daughter
too
sincerely
not
to
respect
her
happiness
paul
s
future
therefore
still
depended
on
himself
if
he
could
make
his
wife
love
him
he
was
saved
the
next
day
at
midnight
after
an
evening
spent
together
with
the
addition
of
the
four
witnesses
to
whom
madame
evangelista
gave
the
formal
dinner
which
follows
the
legal
marriage
the
bridal
pair
accompanied
by
their
friends
heard
mass
by
torchlight
in
presence
of
a
crowd
of
inquisitive
persons
a
marriage
celebrated
at
night
always
suggests
to
the
mind
an
unpleasant
omen
light
is
the
symbol
of
life
and
pleasure
the
forecasts
of
which
are
lacking
to
a
midnight
wedding
ask
the
intrepid
soul
why
it
shivers
why
the
chill
of
those
black
arches
enervates
it
why
the
sound
of
steps
startles
it
why
it
notices
the
cry
of
bats
and
the
hoot
of
owls
though
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
to
tremble
all
present
do
tremble
and
the
darkness
emblem
of
death
saddens
them
natalie
parted
from
her
mother
wept
the
girl
was
now
a
prey
to
those
doubts
which
grasp
the
heart
as
it
enters
a
new
career
in
which
despite
all
assurances
of
happiness
a
thousand
pitfalls
await
the
steps
of
a
young
wife
she
was
cold
and
wanted
a
mantle
the
air
and
manner
of
madame
evangelista
and
that
of
the
bridal
pair
excited
some
comment
among
the
elegant
crowd
which
surrounded
the
altar
solonet
tells
me
that
the
bride
and
bridegroom
leave
for
paris
morning
all
madame
evangelista
was
to
live
with
them
i
count
paul
has
got
rid
of
her
what
a
mistake
said
the
marquise
de
gyas
to
shut
the
door
on
the
mother
of
his
wife
is
to
open
it
to
a
lover
doesn
t
he
know
what
a
mother
is
he
has
been
very
hard
on
madame
evangelista
the
poor
woman
has
had
to
sell
her
house
and
her
diamonds
and
is
going
to
live
at
natalie
looks
very
would
you
like
to
be
made
to
take
a
journey
the
day
after
your
marriage
it
is
very
i
am
glad
i
came
here
said
a
lady
i
am
now
convinced
of
the
necessity
of
the
pomps
of
marriage
and
of
wedding
fetes
a
scene
like
this
is
very
bare
and
sad
if
i
may
say
what
i
think
she
added
in
a
whisper
to
her
neighbor
this
marriage
seems
to
me
madame
evangelista
took
natalie
in
her
carriage
and
accompanied
her
alone
to
paul
s
house
well
mother
it
is
done
remember
my
dear
child
my
last
advice
and
you
will
be
a
happy
woman
be
his
wife
and
not
his
when
natalie
had
retired
the
mother
played
the
little
comedy
of
flinging
herself
with
tears
into
the
arms
of
her
it
was
the
only
provincial
thing
that
madame
evangelista
allowed
herself
but
she
had
her
reasons
for
it
amid
tears
and
speeches
apparently
half
wild
and
despairing
she
obtained
of
paul
those
concessions
which
all
husbands
make
the
next
day
she
put
the
married
pair
into
their
carriage
and
accompanied
them
to
the
ferry
by
which
the
road
to
paris
crosses
the
gironde
with
a
look
and
a
word
natalie
enabled
her
mother
to
see
that
if
paul
had
won
the
trick
in
the
game
of
the
contract
her
revenge
was
beginning
natalie
was
already
reducing
her
husband
to
perfect
obedience
chapter
vi
conclusion
five
years
later
on
an
afternoon
in
the
month
of
november
comte
paul
de
manerville
wrapped
in
a
cloak
was
entering
with
a
bowed
head
and
a
mysterious
manner
the
house
of
his
old
friend
monsieur
mathias
at
bordeaux
too
old
to
continue
in
business
the
worthy
notary
had
sold
his
practice
and
was
ending
his
days
peacefully
in
a
quiet
house
to
which
he
had
retired
an
urgent
affair
had
obliged
him
to
be
absent
at
the
moment
of
his
guest
s
arrival
but
his
housekeeper
warned
of
paul
s
coming
took
him
to
the
room
of
the
late
madame
mathias
who
had
been
dead
a
year
fatigued
by
a
rapid
journey
paul
slept
till
evening
when
the
old
man
reached
home
he
went
up
to
his
client
s
room
and
watched
him
sleeping
as
a
mother
watches
her
child
josette
the
old
housekeeper
followed
her
master
and
stood
before
the
bed
her
hands
on
her
hips
it
is
a
year
josette
since
i
received
my
dear
wife
s
last
sigh
i
little
knew
then
that
i
should
stand
here
again
to
see
the
count
half
poor
man
he
moans
in
his
sleep
said
josette
sac
a
papier
cried
the
old
notary
an
innocent
oath
which
was
a
sign
with
him
of
the
despair
on
a
man
of
business
before
insurmountable
difficulties
at
any
rate
he
thought
i
have
saved
the
title
to
the
lanstrac
estate
for
him
and
that
of
ausac
and
his
house
though
the
usufruct
has
mathias
counted
his
fingers
five
years
just
five
years
this
month
since
his
old
aunt
now
dead
that
excellent
madame
de
maulincour
asked
for
the
hand
of
that
little
crocodile
of
a
woman
who
has
finally
ruined
him
as
i
and
the
gouty
old
gentleman
leaning
on
his
cane
went
to
walk
in
the
little
garden
till
his
guest
should
awake
at
nine
o
clock
supper
was
served
for
mathias
took
supper
the
old
man
was
not
a
little
astonished
when
paul
joined
him
to
see
that
his
old
client
s
brow
was
calm
and
his
face
serene
though
noticeably
changed
if
at
the
age
of
the
comte
de
manerville
seemed
to
be
a
man
of
forty
that
change
in
his
appearance
was
due
solely
to
mental
shocks
physically
he
was
well
he
clasped
the
old
man
s
hand
affectionately
and
forced
him
not
to
rise
saying
dear
kind
maitre
mathias
you
too
have
had
your
mine
were
natural
troubles
monsieur
le
comte
but
yours
we
will
talk
of
that
presently
while
we
if
i
had
not
a
son
in
the
magistracy
and
a
daughter
married
said
the
good
old
man
you
would
have
found
in
old
mathias
believe
me
monsieur
le
comte
something
better
than
mere
hospitality
why
have
you
come
to
bordeaux
at
the
very
moment
when
posters
are
on
all
the
walls
of
the
seizure
of
your
farms
at
grassol
and
guadet
the
vineyard
of
and
the
family
mansion
i
can
not
tell
you
the
grief
i
feel
at
the
sight
of
those
placards
i
who
for
forty
years
nursed
that
property
as
if
it
belonged
to
me
i
who
bought
it
for
your
mother
when
i
was
only
third
clerk
to
monsieur
chesnau
my
predecessor
and
wrote
the
deeds
myself
in
my
best
round
hand
i
who
have
those
titles
now
in
my
successor
s
office
i
who
have
known
you
since
you
were
so
high
and
the
old
man
stopped
to
put
his
hand
near
the
ground
ah
a
man
must
have
been
a
notary
for
years
and
a
half
to
know
the
sort
of
grief
i
feel
to
see
my
name
exposed
before
the
face
of
israel
in
those
announcements
of
the
seizure
and
sale
of
the
property
when
i
pass
through
the
streets
and
see
men
reading
these
horrible
yellow
posters
i
am
ashamed
as
if
my
own
honor
and
ruin
were
concerned
some
fools
will
stand
there
and
read
them
aloud
expressly
to
draw
other
fools
about
them
and
what
imbecile
remarks
they
make
as
if
a
man
were
not
master
of
his
own
property
your
father
ran
through
two
fortunes
before
he
made
the
one
he
left
you
and
you
wouldn
t
be
a
manerville
if
you
didn
t
do
likewise
besides
seizures
of
real
estate
have
a
whole
section
of
the
code
to
themselves
they
are
expected
and
provided
for
you
are
in
a
position
recognized
by
the
if
i
were
not
an
old
man
with
white
hair
i
would
thrash
those
fools
i
hear
reading
aloud
in
the
streets
such
an
abomination
as
this
added
the
worthy
notary
taking
up
a
paper
at
the
request
of
dame
natalie
evangelista
wife
of
comte
de
manerville
separated
from
him
as
to
worldly
goods
and
chattels
by
the
lower
court
of
the
department
of
the
seine
yes
and
now
separated
in
body
said
paul
ah
exclaimed
the
old
man
oh
against
my
wife
s
will
added
the
count
hastily
i
was
forced
to
deceive
her
she
did
not
know
that
i
was
leaving
you
have
left
her
my
passage
is
taken
i
sail
for
calcutta
on
the
two
day
s
hence
cried
the
notary
then
monsieur
le
comte
we
shall
never
meet
you
are
only
my
dear
mathias
and
you
have
the
gout
the
brevet
of
old
age
when
i
return
i
shall
find
you
still
afoot
your
good
head
and
heart
will
be
as
sound
as
ever
and
you
will
help
me
to
reconstruct
what
is
now
a
shaken
edifice
i
intend
to
make
a
noble
fortune
in
seven
years
i
shall
be
only
forty
on
my
return
all
is
still
possible
at
that
you
said
mathias
with
a
gesture
of
amazement
you
monsieur
le
comte
to
undertake
commerce
how
can
you
even
think
of
it
i
am
no
longer
monsieur
le
comte
dear
mathias
my
passage
is
taken
under
the
name
of
camille
one
of
my
mother
s
baptismal
names
i
have
acquirements
which
will
enable
me
to
make
my
fortune
otherwise
than
in
business
commerce
at
any
rate
will
be
only
my
final
chance
i
start
with
a
sum
in
hand
sufficient
for
the
redemption
of
my
future
on
a
large
where
is
that
money
a
friend
is
to
send
it
to
the
old
man
dropped
his
fork
as
he
heard
the
word
friend
not
in
surprise
not
scoffingly
but
in
grief
his
look
and
manner
expressed
the
pain
he
felt
in
finding
paul
under
the
influence
of
a
deceitful
illusion
his
practised
eye
fathomed
a
gulf
where
the
count
saw
nothing
but
solid
ground
i
have
been
fifty
years
in
the
notariat
he
said
and
i
never
yet
knew
a
ruined
man
whose
friend
would
lend
him
you
don
t
know
de
marsay
i
am
certain
that
he
has
sold
out
some
of
his
investments
already
and
you
will
receive
from
him
a
bill
of
exchange
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
i
hope
i
may
if
that
be
so
can
not
your
friend
settle
your
difficulties
here
you
could
live
quietly
at
lanstrac
for
five
or
six
years
on
your
wife
s
income
and
so
recover
no
assignment
or
economy
on
my
part
could
pay
off
fifteen
hundred
thousand
francs
of
debt
in
which
my
wife
is
involved
to
the
amount
of
five
hundred
and
fifty
you
can
not
mean
to
say
that
in
four
years
you
have
incurred
a
million
and
a
half
of
debt
nothing
is
more
certain
mathias
did
i
not
give
those
diamonds
to
my
wife
did
i
not
spend
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
i
received
from
the
sale
of
madame
evangelista
s
house
in
the
arrangement
of
my
house
in
paris
was
i
not
forced
to
use
other
money
for
the
first
payments
on
that
property
demanded
by
the
marriage
contract
i
was
even
forced
to
sell
out
natalie
s
forty
thousand
a
year
in
the
funds
to
complete
the
purchase
of
auzac
and
we
sold
at
therefore
i
became
in
debt
for
over
two
hundred
thousand
francs
within
a
month
after
my
marriage
that
left
us
only
thousand
francs
a
year
but
we
spent
fully
three
times
as
much
every
year
add
all
that
up
together
with
rates
of
interest
to
usurers
and
you
will
soon
find
a
exclaimed
the
old
notary
go
on
what
next
well
i
wanted
in
the
first
place
to
complete
for
my
wife
that
set
of
jewels
of
which
she
had
the
pearl
necklace
clasped
by
the
family
diamond
the
discreto
and
her
mother
s
i
paid
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
a
coronet
of
diamond
there
s
eleven
hundred
thousand
and
now
i
find
i
owe
the
fortune
of
my
wife
which
amounts
to
three
hundred
and
thousand
francs
of
her
but
said
mathias
if
madame
la
comtesse
had
given
up
her
diamonds
and
you
had
pledged
your
income
you
could
have
pacified
your
creditors
and
have
paid
them
off
in
when
a
man
is
down
mathias
when
his
property
is
covered
with
mortgages
when
his
wife
s
claims
take
precedence
of
his
creditors
and
when
that
man
has
notes
out
for
a
hundred
thousand
francs
which
he
must
pay
and
i
hope
i
can
do
so
out
of
the
increased
value
of
my
property
here
what
you
propose
is
not
this
is
dreadful
cried
mathias
would
you
sell
with
the
vintage
of
still
in
the
cellars
i
can
not
help
is
worth
six
hundred
thousand
natalie
will
buy
it
in
i
have
advised
her
to
do
i
might
push
the
price
to
seven
hundred
thousand
and
the
farms
are
worth
a
hundred
thousand
then
if
the
house
in
bordeaux
can
be
sold
for
two
hundred
thousand
solonet
will
give
more
than
that
he
wants
it
he
is
retiring
with
a
handsome
property
made
by
gambling
on
the
funds
he
has
sold
his
practice
for
three
hundred
thousand
francs
and
marries
a
mulatto
woman
god
knows
how
she
got
her
money
but
they
say
it
amounts
to
millions
a

a

a
black
woman
what
an
age
it
is
said
that
he
speculates
for
your
with
her
she
has
greatly
improved
lanstrac
and
taken
great
pains
with
its
cultivation
she
has
amply
repaid
me
for
the
use
of
i
shouldn
t
have
thought
her
capable
of
she
is
so
kind
and
so
devoted
she
has
always
paid
natalie
s
debts
during
the
three
months
she
spent
with
us
every
year
in
she
could
well
afford
to
do
so
for
she
gets
her
living
out
of
lanstrac
said
mathias
she
grown
economical
what
a
miracle
i
am
told
she
has
just
bought
the
domain
of
grainrouge
between
lanstrac
and
grassol
so
that
if
the
lanstrac
avenue
were
extended
to
the
you
would
drive
four
and
a
half
miles
through
your
own
property
to
reach
the
house
she
paid
one
hundred
thousand
francs
down
for
she
is
as
handsome
as
ever
said
paul
country
life
preserves
her
freshness
i
don
t
mean
to
go
to
lanstrac
and
bid
her
her
heart
would
bleed
for
me
too
you
would
go
in
vain
she
is
now
in
paris
she
probably
arrived
there
as
you
no
doubt
she
had
heard
of
the
sale
of
my
property
and
came
to
help
me
i
have
no
complaint
to
make
of
life
mathias
i
am
truly
loved
as
much
as
any
man
ever
could
be
here
below
beloved
by
two
women
who
outdo
each
other
in
devotion
they
are
even
jealous
of
each
other
the
daughter
blames
the
mother
for
loving
me
too
much
and
the
mother
reproaches
the
daughter
for
what
she
calls
her
dissipations
i
may
say
that
this
great
affection
has
been
my
ruin
how
could
i
fail
to
satisfy
even
the
slightest
caprice
of
a
loving
wife
impossible
to
restrain
myself
neither
could
i
accept
any
sacrifice
on
her
part
we
might
certainly
as
you
say
live
at
lanstrac
save
my
income
and
part
with
her
diamonds
but
i
would
rather
go
to
india
and
work
for
a
fortune
than
tear
my
natalie
from
the
life
she
enjoys
so
it
was
i
who
proposed
the
separation
as
to
property
women
are
angels
who
ought
not
to
be
mixed
up
in
the
sordid
interests
of
old
mathias
listened
in
doubt
and
amazement
you
have
no
children
i
think
he
said
fortunately
none
replied
paul
that
is
not
my
idea
of
marriage
remarked
the
old
notary
naively
a
wife
ought
in
my
opinion
to
share
the
good
and
evil
fortunes
of
her
husband
i
have
heard
that
young
married
people
who
love
like
lovers
do
not
want
children
is
pleasure
the
only
object
of
marriage
i
say
that
object
should
be
the
joys
of
family
moreover
in
this
case
i
am
afraid
you
will
think
me
too
much
of
notary
your
marriage
contract
made
it
incumbent
upon
you
to
have
a
son
yes
monsieur
le
comte
you
ought
to
have
had
at
once
a
male
heir
to
consolidate
that
entail
why
not
madame
evangelista
was
strong
and
healthy
she
had
nothing
to
fear
in
maternity
you
will
tell
me
perhaps
that
these
are
the
notions
of
our
ancestors
but
in
those
noble
families
monsieur
le
comte
the
legitimate
wife
thought
it
her
duty
to
bear
children
and
bring
them
up
nobly
as
the
duchesse
de
sully
the
wife
of
the
great
sully
said
a
wife
is
not
an
instrument
of
pleasure
but
the
honor
and
virtue
of
her
you
don
t
know
women
my
good
mathias
said
paul
in
order
to
be
happy
we
must
love
them
as
they
want
to
be
loved
isn
t
there
something
brutal
in
at
once
depriving
a
wife
of
her
charms
and
spoiling
her
beauty
before
she
has
begun
to
enjoy
it
if
you
had
had
children
your
wife
would
not
have
dissipated
your
fortune
she
would
have
stayed
at
home
and
looked
after
if
you
were
right
dear
friend
said
paul
frowning
i
should
be
still
more
unhappy
than
i
am
do
not
aggravate
my
sufferings
by
preaching
to
me
after
my
fall
let
me
go
without
the
pang
of
looking
backward
to
my
the
next
day
mathias
received
a
bill
of
exchange
for
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
from
de
marsay
you
see
said
paul
he
does
not
write
a
word
to
me
he
begins
by
obliging
me
henri
s
nature
is
the
most
imperfectly
perfect
the
most
illegally
beautiful
that
i
know
if
you
knew
with
what
superiority
that
man
still
young
can
rise
above
sentiments
above
and
judge
them
you
would
be
astonished
as
i
am
to
find
how
much
heart
he
mathias
tried
to
battle
with
paul
s
determination
but
he
found
it
irrevocable
and
it
was
justified
by
so
many
cogent
reasons
that
the
old
man
finally
ceased
his
endeavors
to
retain
his
client
it
is
seldom
that
vessels
sail
promptly
at
the
time
appointed
but
on
this
occasion
by
a
fateful
circumstance
for
paul
the
wind
was
fair
and
the
sailed
on
the
morrow
as
expected
the
quay
was
lined
with
relations
and
friends
and
idle
persons
among
them
were
several
who
had
formerly
known
manerville
his
disaster
posted
on
the
walls
of
the
town
made
him
as
celebrated
as
he
was
in
the
days
of
his
wealth
and
fashion
curiosity
was
aroused
every
one
had
their
word
to
say
about
him
old
mathias
accompanied
his
client
to
the
quay
and
his
sufferings
were
sore
as
he
caught
a
few
words
of
those
remarks
who
could
recognize
in
that
man
you
see
over
there
near
old
mathias
the
dandy
who
was
called
the
pink
of
fashion
five
years
ago
and
made
as
they
say
fair
weather
and
foul
in
what
that
stout
short
man
in
the
alpaca
overcoat
who
looks
like
a
groom
is
that
comte
paul
de
manerville
yes
my
dear
the
same
who
married
mademoiselle
evangelista
here
he
is
ruined
without
a
penny
to
his
name
going
out
to
india
to
look
for
but
how
did
he
ruin
himself
he
was
very
oh
paris
women
play
luxury
gambling
at
the
bourse
besides
said
another
manerville
always
was
a
poor
creature
no
mind
soft
as
he
d
let
anybody
shear
the
wool
from
his
back
incapable
of
anything
no
matter
what
he
was
born
to
be
paul
wrung
the
hand
of
the
old
man
and
went
on
board
mathias
stood
upon
the
pier
looking
at
his
client
who
leaned
against
the
shrouds
defying
the
crowed
before
him
with
a
glance
of
contempt
at
the
moment
when
the
sailors
began
to
weigh
anchor
paul
noticed
that
mathias
was
making
signals
to
him
with
his
handkerchief
the
old
housekeeper
had
hurried
to
her
master
who
seemed
to
be
excited
by
some
sudden
event
paul
asked
the
captain
to
wait
a
moment
and
send
a
boat
to
the
pier
which
was
done
too
feeble
himself
to
go
aboard
mathias
gave
two
letters
to
a
sailor
in
the
boat
my
friend
he
said
this
packet
showing
one
of
the
two
letters
is
important
it
has
just
arrived
by
a
courier
from
paris
in
hours
state
this
to
monsieur
le
comte
don
t
neglect
to
do
so
it
may
change
his
would
he
come
ashore
possibly
my
friend
said
the
notary
imprudently
the
sailor
is
in
all
lands
a
being
of
a
race
apart
holding
all
in
contempt
this
one
happened
to
be
a
who
saw
but
one
thing
in
maitre
mathias
s
request
come
ashore
indeed
he
thought
as
he
rowed
make
the
captain
lose
a
passenger
if
one
listened
to
those
walruses
we
d
have
nothing
to
do
but
embark
and
disembark
em
he
s
afraid
that
son
of
his
will
catch
the
sailor
gave
paul
the
letter
and
said
not
a
word
of
the
message
recognizing
the
handwriting
of
his
wife
and
de
marsay
paul
supposed
that
he
knew
what
they
both
would
urge
upon
him
anxious
not
to
be
influenced
by
offers
which
he
believed
their
devotion
to
his
welfare
would
inspire
he
put
the
letters
in
his
pocket
unread
with
apparent
indifference
absorbed
in
the
sad
thoughts
which
assail
the
strongest
man
under
such
circumstances
paul
gave
way
to
his
grief
as
he
waved
his
hand
to
his
old
friend
and
bade
farewell
to
france
watching
the
steeples
of
bordeaux
as
they
fled
out
of
sight
he
seated
himself
on
a
coil
of
rope
night
overtook
him
still
lost
in
thought
with
the
of
the
dying
day
came
doubts
he
cast
an
anxious
eye
into
the
future
sounding
it
and
finding
there
uncertainty
and
danger
he
asked
his
soul
if
courage
would
fail
him
a
vague
dread
seized
his
mind
as
he
thought
of
natalie
left
wholly
to
herself
he
repented
the
step
he
had
taken
he
regretted
paris
and
his
life
there
suddenly
overcame
him
every
one
knows
the
effect
of
that
disorder
the
most
horrible
of
its
sufferings
devoid
of
danger
is
a
complete
dissolution
of
the
will
an
inexplicable
distress
relaxes
to
their
very
centre
the
cords
of
vitality
the
soul
no
longer
performs
its
functions
the
sufferer
becomes
indifferent
to
everything
the
mother
forgets
her
child
the
lover
his
mistress
the
strongest
man
lies
prone
like
an
inert
mass
paul
was
carried
to
his
cabin
where
he
stayed
three
days
lying
on
his
back
gorged
with
grog
by
the
sailors
or
vomiting
thinking
of
nothing
and
sleeping
much
then
he
revived
into
a
species
of
convalescence
and
returned
by
degrees
to
his
ordinary
condition
the
first
morning
after
he
felt
better
he
went
on
deck
and
passed
the
poop
breathing
in
the
salt
breezes
of
another
atmosphere
putting
his
hands
into
his
pockets
he
felt
the
letters
at
once
he
opened
them
beginning
with
that
of
his
wife
in
order
that
the
letter
of
the
comtesse
de
manerville
be
fully
understood
it
is
necessary
to
give
the
one
which
paul
had
written
to
her
on
the
day
that
he
left
paris
from
paul
de
manerville
to
his
wife
my
beloved
when
you
read
this
letter
i
shall
be
far
away
from
you
perhaps
already
on
the
vessel
which
is
to
take
me
to
india
where
i
am
going
to
repair
my
shattered
fortune
i
have
not
found
courage
to
tell
you
of
my
departure
i
have
deceived
you
but
it
was
best
to
do
so
you
would
only
have
been
uselessly
distressed
you
would
have
wished
to
sacrifice
your
fortune
and
that
i
could
not
have
suffered
dear
natalie
feel
no
remorse
i
have
no
regrets
when
i
return
with
millions
i
shall
imitate
your
father
and
lay
them
at
your
feet
as
he
laid
his
at
the
feet
of
your
mother
saying
to
you
all
i
have
is
i
love
you
madly
natalie
i
say
this
without
fear
that
the
avowal
will
lead
you
to
strain
a
power
which
none
but
weak
men
fear
yours
has
been
boundless
from
the
day
i
knew
you
first
my
love
is
the
only
accomplice
in
my
disaster
i
have
felt
as
my
ruin
progressed
the
delirious
joys
of
a
gambler
as
the
money
diminished
so
my
enjoyment
grew
each
fragment
of
my
fortune
turned
into
some
little
pleasure
for
you
gave
me
untold
happiness
i
could
have
wished
that
you
had
more
caprices
that
i
might
gratify
them
all
i
knew
i
was
marching
to
a
precipice
but
i
went
on
crowned
with
joys
of
which
a
common
heart
knows
nothing
i
have
acted
like
those
lovers
who
take
refuge
in
a
cottage
on
the
shores
of
some
lake
for
a
year
or
two
resolved
to
kill
themselves
at
last
dying
thus
in
all
the
glory
of
their
illusions
and
their
love
i
have
always
thought
such
persons
infinitely
sensible
you
have
known
nothing
of
my
pleasures
or
my
sacrifices
the
greatest
joy
of
all
was
to
hide
from
the
one
beloved
the
cost
of
her
desires
i
can
reveal
these
secrets
to
you
now
for
when
you
hold
this
paper
heavy
with
love
i
shall
be
far
away
though
i
lose
the
treasures
of
your
gratitude
i
do
not
suffer
that
contraction
of
the
heart
which
would
disable
me
if
i
spoke
to
you
of
these
matters
besides
my
own
beloved
is
there
not
a
tender
calculation
in
thus
revealing
to
you
the
history
of
the
past
does
it
not
extend
our
love
into
the
future
but
we
need
no
such
supports
we
love
each
other
with
a
love
to
which
proof
is
needless
a
love
which
takes
no
note
of
time
or
distance
but
lives
of
itself
alone
ah
natalie
i
have
just
looked
at
you
asleep
trustful
restful
as
a
little
child
your
hand
stretched
toward
me
i
left
a
tear
upon
the
pillow
which
has
known
our
precious
joys
i
leave
you
without
fear
on
the
faith
of
that
attitude
i
go
to
win
the
future
of
our
love
by
bringing
home
to
you
a
fortune
large
enough
to
gratify
your
every
taste
and
let
no
shadow
of
anxiety
disturb
our
joys
neither
you
nor
i
can
do
without
enjoyments
in
the
life
we
live
to
me
belongs
the
task
of
providing
the
necessary
fortune
i
am
a
man
and
i
have
courage
perhaps
you
might
seek
to
follow
me
for
that
reason
i
conceal
from
you
the
name
of
the
vessel
the
port
from
which
i
sail
and
the
day
of
sailing
after
i
am
gone
when
too
late
to
follow
me
a
friend
will
tell
you
all
natalie
my
affection
is
boundless
i
love
you
as
a
mother
loves
her
child
as
a
lover
loves
his
mistress
with
absolute
unselfishness
to
me
the
toil
to
you
the
pleasures
to
me
all
sufferings
to
you
all
happiness
amuse
yourself
continue
your
habits
of
luxury
go
to
theatres
and
operas
enjoy
society
and
balls
i
leave
you
free
for
all
things
dear
angel
when
you
return
to
this
nest
where
for
five
years
we
have
tasted
the
fruits
which
love
has
ripened
think
of
your
friend
think
for
a
moment
of
me
and
rest
upon
my
heart
that
is
all
i
ask
of
you
for
myself
dear
eternal
thought
of
mine
whether
under
burning
skies
toiling
for
both
of
us
i
face
obstacles
to
vanquish
or
whether
weary
with
the
struggle
i
rest
my
mind
on
hopes
of
a
return
i
shall
think
of
you
alone
of
you
who
are
my
life
my
blessed
life
yes
i
shall
live
in
you
i
shall
tell
myself
daily
that
you
have
no
troubles
no
cares
that
you
are
happy
as
in
our
natural
lives
of
day
and
night
of
sleeping
and
waking
i
shall
have
sunny
days
in
paris
and
nights
of
toil
in
india
a
painful
dream
a
joyful
reality
and
i
shall
live
so
utterly
in
that
reality
that
my
actual
life
will
pass
as
a
dream
i
shall
have
memories
i
shall
recall
line
by
line
strophe
by
strophe
our
glorious
five
years
poem
i
shall
remember
the
days
of
your
pleasure
in
some
new
dress
or
some
adornment
which
made
you
to
my
eyes
a
fresh
delight
yes
dear
angel
i
go
like
a
man
vowed
to
some
great
emprize
the
guerdon
of
which
if
success
attend
him
is
the
recovery
of
his
beautiful
mistress
oh
my
precious
love
my
natalie
keep
me
as
a
religion
in
your
heart
be
the
child
that
i
have
just
seen
asleep
if
you
betray
my
confidence
my
blind
confidence
you
need
not
fear
my
anger
be
sure
of
that
i
should
die
silently
but
a
wife
does
not
deceive
the
man
who
leaves
her
free
for
woman
is
never
base
she
tricks
a
tyrant
but
an
easy
treachery
which
would
kill
its
victim
she
will
not
commit
no
no
i
will
not
think
of
it
forgive
this
cry
this
single
cry
so
natural
to
the
heart
of
man
dear
love
you
will
see
de
marsay
he
is
now
the
lessee
of
our
house
and
he
will
leave
you
in
possession
of
it
this
nominal
lease
was
necessary
to
avoid
a
useless
loss
our
creditors
ignorant
that
their
payment
is
a
question
of
time
only
would
otherwise
have
seized
the
furniture
and
the
temporary
possession
of
the
house
be
kind
to
de
marsay
i
have
the
most
entire
confidence
in
his
capacity
and
his
loyalty
take
him
as
your
defender
and
adviser
make
him
your
slave
however
occupied
he
will
always
find
time
to
be
devoted
to
you
i
have
placed
the
liquidation
of
my
affairs
and
the
payment
of
the
debts
in
his
hands
if
he
should
advance
some
sum
of
which
he
should
later
feel
in
need
i
rely
on
you
to
pay
it
back
remember
however
that
i
do
not
leave
you
to
de
marsay
but
i
do
not
seek
to
impose
him
upon
you
alas
i
have
but
an
hour
more
to
stay
beside
you
i
can
not
spend
that
hour
in
writing
business
i
count
your
breaths
i
try
to
guess
your
thoughts
in
the
slight
motions
of
your
sleep
i
would
i
could
infuse
my
blood
into
your
veins
that
you
might
be
a
part
of
me
my
thought
your
thought
and
your
heart
mine
a
murmur
has
just
escaped
your
lips
as
though
it
were
a
soft
reply
be
calm
and
beautiful
forever
as
you
are
now
ah
would
that
i
possessed
that
fabulous
fairy
power
which
with
a
wand
could
make
you
sleep
while
i
am
absent
until
returning
i
should
wake
you
with
a
kiss
how
much
i
must
love
you
how
much
energy
of
soul
i
must
possess
to
leave
you
as
i
see
you
now
adieu
my
cherished
one
your
poor
pink
of
fashion
is
blown
away
by
stormy
winds
but
the
wings
of
his
good
luck
shall
waft
him
back
to
you
no
my
ninie
i
am
not
bidding
you
farewell
for
i
shall
never
leave
you
are
you
not
the
soul
of
my
actions
is
not
the
hope
of
returning
with
happiness
indestructible
for
you
the
end
and
aim
of
my
endeavor
does
it
not
lead
my
every
step
you
will
be
with
me
everywhere
ah
it
will
not
be
the
sun
of
india
but
the
fire
of
your
eyes
that
lights
my
way
therefore
be
happy
as
happy
as
a
woman
can
be
without
her
lover
i
would
the
last
kiss
that
i
take
from
those
dear
lips
were
not
a
passive
one
but
my
ninie
my
adored
one
i
will
not
wake
you
when
you
wake
you
will
find
a
tear
upon
your
forehead
make
it
a
talisman
think
think
of
him
who
may
perhaps
die
for
you
far
from
you
think
less
of
the
husband
than
of
the
lover
who
confides
you
to
god
from
the
comtesse
de
manerville
to
her
husband
dear
beloved
one
your
letter
has
plunged
me
into
affliction
had
you
the
right
to
take
this
course
which
must
affect
us
equally
without
consulting
me
are
you
free
do
you
not
belong
to
me
if
you
must
go
why
should
i
not
follow
you
you
show
me
paul
that
i
am
not
indispensable
to
you
what
have
i
done
to
be
deprived
of
my
rights
surely
i
count
for
something
in
this
ruin
my
luxuries
have
weighed
somewhat
in
the
scale
you
make
me
curse
the
happy
careless
life
we
have
led
for
the
last
five
years
to
know
that
you
are
banished
from
france
for
years
is
enough
to
kill
me
how
soon
can
a
fortune
be
made
in
india
will
you
ever
return
i
was
right
when
i
refused
with
instinctive
obstinacy
that
separation
as
to
property
which
my
mother
and
you
were
so
determined
to
carry
out
what
did
i
tell
you
then
did
i
not
warn
you
that
it
was
casting
a
reflection
upon
you
and
would
ruin
your
credit
it
was
not
until
you
were
really
angry
that
i
gave
way
my
dear
paul
never
have
you
been
so
noble
in
my
eyes
as
you
are
at
this
moment
to
despair
of
nothing
to
start
courageously
to
seek
a
fortune
only
your
character
your
strength
of
mind
could
do
it
i
sit
at
your
feet
a
man
who
avows
his
weakness
with
your
good
faith
who
rebuilds
his
fortune
from
the
same
motive
that
made
him
wreck
it
for
love
s
sake
for
the
sake
of
an
irresistible
passion
oh
paul
that
man
is
sublime
therefore
fear
nothing
go
on
through
all
obstacles
not
doubting
your
natalie
for
that
would
be
doubting
yourself
poor
darling
you
mean
to
live
in
me
and
i
shall
ever
be
in
you
i
shall
not
be
here
i
shall
be
wherever
you
are
wherever
you
go
though
your
letter
has
caused
me
the
keenest
pain
it
has
also
filled
me
with
joy
you
have
made
me
know
those
two
extremes
seeing
how
you
love
me
i
have
been
proud
to
learn
that
my
love
is
truly
felt
sometimes
i
have
thought
that
i
loved
you
more
than
you
loved
me
now
i
admit
myself
vanquished
you
have
added
the
delightful
superiority
of
loving
to
all
the
others
with
which
you
are
blest
that
precious
letter
in
which
your
soul
reveals
itself
will
lie
upon
my
heart
during
all
your
absence
for
my
soul
too
is
in
it
that
letter
is
my
glory
i
shall
go
to
live
at
lanstrac
with
my
mother
i
die
to
the
world
i
will
economize
my
income
and
pay
your
debts
to
their
last
farthing
from
this
day
forth
paul
i
am
another
woman
i
bid
farewell
forever
to
society
i
will
have
no
pleasures
that
you
can
not
share
besides
paul
i
ought
to
leave
paris
and
live
in
retirement
dear
friend
you
will
soon
have
a
noble
reason
to
make
your
fortune
if
your
courage
needed
a
spur
you
would
find
it
in
this
can
not
you
guess
we
shall
have
a
child
your
cherished
desires
are
granted
i
feared
to
give
you
one
of
those
false
hopes
which
hurt
so
much
have
we
not
had
grief
enough
already
on
that
score
i
was
determined
not
to
be
mistaken
in
this
good
news
i
feel
certain
and
it
makes
me
happy
to
shed
this
joy
upon
your
sorrows
this
morning
fearing
nothing
and
thinking
you
still
at
home
i
went
to
the
assumption
all
things
smiled
upon
me
how
could
i
foresee
misfortune
as
i
left
the
church
i
met
my
mother
she
had
heard
of
your
distress
and
came
by
post
with
all
her
savings
thirty
thousand
francs
hoping
to
help
you
ah
what
a
heart
is
hers
paul
i
felt
joyful
and
hurried
home
to
tell
you
this
good
news
and
to
breakfast
with
you
in
the
greenhouse
where
i
ordered
just
the
dainties
that
you
like
well
augustine
brought
me
your
letter
a
letter
from
you
when
we
had
slept
together
a
cold
fear
seized
me
it
was
like
a
dream
i
read
your
letter
i
read
it
weeping
and
my
mother
shared
my
tears
i
was
such
love
such
courage
such
happiness
such
misery
the
richest
fortunes
of
the
heart
and
the
momentary
ruin
of
all
interests
to
lose
you
at
a
moment
when
my
admiration
of
your
greatness
thrilled
me
what
woman
could
have
resisted
such
a
tempest
of
emotion
to
know
you
far
away
when
your
hand
upon
my
heart
would
have
stilled
its
throbbings
to
feel
that
you
were
not
here
to
give
me
that
look
so
precious
to
me
to
rejoice
in
our
new
hopes
that
i
was
not
with
you
to
soften
your
sorrows
by
those
caresses
which
made
your
natalie
so
dear
to
you
i
wished
to
start
to
follow
you
to
fly
to
you
but
my
mother
told
me
you
had
taken
passage
in
a
ship
which
leaves
bordeaux
that
i
could
not
reach
you
except
by
post
and
moreover
that
it
was
madness
in
my
present
state
to
risk
our
future
by
attempting
to
follow
you
i
could
not
bear
such
violent
emotions
i
was
taken
ill
and
am
writing
to
you
now
in
bed
my
mother
is
doing
all
she
can
to
stop
certain
calumnies
which
seem
to
have
got
about
on
your
disaster
the
vandenesses
charles
and
felix
have
earnestly
defended
you
but
your
friend
de
marsay
treats
the
affair
satirically
he
laughs
at
your
accusers
instead
of
replying
to
them
i
do
not
like
his
way
of
lightly
brushing
aside
such
serious
attacks
are
you
not
deceived
in
him
however
i
will
obey
you
i
will
make
him
my
friend
do
not
be
anxious
my
adored
one
on
the
points
that
concern
your
honor
is
it
not
mine
as
well
my
diamonds
shall
be
pledged
we
intend
mamma
and
i
to
employ
our
utmost
resources
in
the
payment
of
your
debts
and
we
shall
try
to
buy
back
your
vineyard
at
my
mother
who
understands
business
like
a
lawyer
blames
you
very
much
for
not
having
told
her
of
your
embarrassments
she
would
not
have
bought
thinking
to
please
you
the
grainrouge
domain
and
then
she
could
have
lent
you
that
money
as
well
as
the
thirty
thousand
francs
she
brought
with
her
she
is
in
despair
at
your
decision
she
fears
the
climate
of
india
for
your
health
she
entreats
you
to
be
sober
and
not
to
let
yourself
be
trapped
by
women
that
made
me
laugh
i
am
as
sure
of
you
as
i
am
of
myself
you
will
return
to
me
rich
and
faithful
i
alone
know
your
feminine
delicacy
and
the
secret
sentiments
which
make
you
a
human
flower
worthy
of
the
gardens
of
heaven
the
bordeaux
people
were
right
when
they
gave
you
your
floral
nickname
but
alas
who
will
take
care
of
my
delicate
flower
my
heart
is
rent
with
dreadful
ideas
i
his
wife
natalie
i
am
here
and
perhaps
he
suffers
far
away
from
me
and
not
to
share
your
pains
your
vexations
your
dangers
in
whom
will
you
confide
how
will
you
live
without
that
ear
into
which
you
have
hitherto
poured
all
dear
sensitive
plant
swept
away
by
this
storm
will
you
be
able
to
survive
in
another
soil
than
your
native
land
it
seems
to
me
that
i
have
been
alone
for
centuries
i
have
wept
sorely
to
be
the
cause
of
your
ruin
what
a
text
for
the
thoughts
of
a
loving
woman
you
treated
me
like
a
child
to
whom
we
give
all
it
asks
or
like
a
courtesan
allowed
by
some
thoughtless
youth
to
squander
his
fortune
ah
such
indulgence
was
in
truth
an
insult
did
you
think
i
could
not
live
without
fine
dresses
balls
and
operas
and
social
triumphs
am
i
so
frivolous
a
woman
do
you
think
me
incapable
of
serious
thought
of
ministering
to
your
fortune
as
i
have
to
your
pleasures
if
you
were
not
so
far
away
and
so
unhappy
i
would
blame
you
for
that
impertinence
why
lower
your
wife
in
that
way
good
heavens
what
induced
me
to
go
into
society
at
all
to
flatter
your
vanity
i
adorned
myself
for
you
as
you
well
know
if
i
did
wrong
i
am
punished
cruelly
your
absence
is
a
harsh
expiation
of
our
mutual
life
perhaps
my
happiness
was
too
complete
it
had
to
be
paid
by
some
great
trial
and
here
it
is
there
is
nothing
now
for
me
but
solitude
yes
i
shall
live
at
lanstrac
the
place
your
father
laid
out
the
house
you
yourself
refurnished
so
luxuriously
there
i
shall
live
with
my
mother
and
my
child
and
await
you
sending
you
daily
night
and
morning
the
prayers
of
all
remember
that
our
love
is
a
talisman
against
all
evil
i
have
no
more
doubt
of
you
than
you
can
have
of
me
what
comfort
can
i
put
into
this
letter
i
so
desolate
so
broken
with
the
lonely
years
before
me
like
a
desert
to
cross
but
no
i
am
not
utterly
unhappy
the
desert
will
be
brightened
by
our
son
yes
it
must
be
a
must
it
not
and
now
adieu
my
own
beloved
our
love
and
prayers
will
follow
you
the
tears
you
see
upon
this
paper
will
tell
you
much
that
i
can
not
write
i
kiss
you
on
this
little
square
of
paper
see
below
take
those
kisses
from
your
natalie
this
letter
threw
paul
into
a
reverie
caused
as
much
by
memories
of
the
past
as
by
these
fresh
assurances
of
love
the
happier
a
man
is
the
more
he
trembles
in
souls
which
are
exclusively
tender
and
exclusive
tenderness
carries
with
it
a
certain
amount
of
weakness
jealousy
and
uneasiness
exist
in
direct
proportion
to
the
amount
of
the
happiness
and
its
extent
strong
souls
are
neither
jealous
nor
fearful
jealousy
is
doubt
fear
is
meanness
unlimited
belief
is
the
principal
attribute
of
a
great
man
if
he
is
deceived
for
strength
as
well
as
weakness
may
make
a
man
a
dupe
his
contempt
will
serve
him
as
an
axe
with
which
to
cut
through
all
this
greatness
however
is
the
exception
which
of
us
has
not
known
what
it
is
to
be
abandoned
by
the
spirit
which
sustains
our
frail
machine
and
to
hearken
to
that
mysterious
voice
denying
all
paul
his
mind
going
over
the
past
and
caught
here
and
there
by
irrefutable
facts
believed
and
doubted
all
lost
in
thought
a
prey
to
an
awful
and
involuntary
incredulity
which
was
combated
by
the
instincts
of
his
own
pure
love
and
his
faith
in
natalie
he
read
and
that
wordy
letter
unable
to
decide
the
question
which
it
raised
either
for
or
against
his
wife
love
is
sometimes
as
great
and
true
when
smothered
in
words
as
it
is
in
brief
strong
sentences
to
understand
the
situation
into
which
paul
de
manerville
was
about
to
enter
we
must
think
of
him
as
he
was
at
this
moment
floating
upon
the
ocean
as
he
floated
upon
his
past
looking
back
upon
the
years
of
his
life
as
he
looked
at
the
limitless
water
and
cloudless
sky
about
him
and
ending
his
reverie
by
returning
through
tumults
of
doubt
to
faith
the
pure
unalloyed
and
perfect
faith
of
the
christian
and
the
lover
which
enforced
the
voice
of
his
faithful
heart
it
is
necessary
to
give
here
his
own
letter
to
de
marsay
written
on
leaving
paris
to
which
his
friend
replied
in
the
letter
he
received
through
old
mathias
from
the
dock
from
comte
paul
de
manerville
to
monsieur
le
marquis
henri
de
marsay
henri
i
have
to
say
to
you
one
of
the
most
vital
words
a
man
can
say
to
his
friend
i
am
ruined
when
you
read
this
i
shall
be
on
the
point
of
sailing
from
bordeaux
to
calcutta
on
the
brig
you
will
find
in
the
hands
of
your
notary
a
deed
which
only
needs
your
signature
to
be
legal
in
it
i
lease
my
house
to
you
for
six
years
at
a
nominal
rent
send
a
duplicate
of
that
deed
to
my
wife
i
am
forced
to
take
this
precaution
that
natalie
may
continue
to
live
in
her
own
home
without
fear
of
being
driven
out
by
creditors
i
also
convey
to
you
by
deed
the
income
of
my
share
of
the
entailed
property
for
four
years
the
whole
amounting
to
one
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
which
sum
i
beg
you
to
lend
me
and
to
send
in
a
bill
of
exchange
on
some
house
in
bordeaux
to
my
notary
maitre
mathias
my
wife
will
give
you
her
signature
to
this
paper
as
an
endorsement
of
your
claim
to
my
income
if
the
revenues
of
the
entail
do
not
pay
this
loan
as
quickly
as
i
now
expect
you
and
i
will
settle
on
my
return
the
sum
i
ask
for
is
absolutely
necessary
to
enable
me
to
seek
my
fortune
in
india
and
if
i
know
you
i
shall
receive
it
in
bordeaux
the
night
before
i
sail
i
have
acted
as
you
would
have
acted
in
my
place
i
held
firm
to
the
last
moment
letting
no
one
suspect
my
ruin
before
the
news
of
the
seizure
of
my
property
at
bordeaux
reached
paris
i
had
attempted
with
one
hundred
thousand
francs
which
i
obtained
on
notes
to
recover
myself
by
play
some
lucky
stroke
might
still
have
saved
me
i
lost
how
have
i
ruined
myself
by
my
own
will
henri
from
the
first
month
of
my
married
life
i
saw
that
i
could
not
keep
up
the
style
in
which
i
started
i
knew
the
result
but
i
chose
to
shut
my
eyes
i
could
not
say
to
my
wife
we
must
leave
paris
and
live
at
i
have
ruined
myself
for
her
as
men
ruin
themselves
for
a
mistress
but
i
knew
it
all
along
between
ourselves
i
am
neither
a
fool
nor
a
weak
man
a
fool
does
not
let
himself
be
ruled
with
his
eyes
open
by
a
passion
and
a
man
who
starts
for
india
to
reconstruct
his
fortune
instead
of
blowing
out
his
brains
is
not
weak
i
shall
return
rich
or
i
shall
never
return
at
all
only
my
dear
friend
as
i
want
wealth
solely
for
as
i
must
be
absent
six
years
at
least
and
as
i
will
not
risk
being
duped
in
any
way
i
confide
to
you
my
wife
i
know
no
better
guardian
being
childless
a
lover
might
be
dangerous
to
her
henri
i
love
her
madly
basely
without
proper
pride
i
would
forgive
her
i
think
an
infidelity
not
because
i
am
certain
of
avenging
it
but
because
i
would
kill
myself
to
leave
her
free
and
happy
since
i
could
not
make
her
happiness
myself
but
what
have
i
to
fear
natalie
feels
for
me
that
friendship
which
is
independent
of
love
but
which
preserves
love
i
have
treated
her
like
a
petted
child
i
took
such
delight
in
my
sacrifices
one
led
so
naturally
to
another
that
she
can
never
be
false
she
would
be
a
monster
if
she
were
love
begets
love
alas
shall
i
tell
you
all
my
dear
henri
i
have
just
written
her
a
letter
in
which
i
let
her
think
that
i
go
with
heart
of
hope
and
brow
serene
that
neither
jealousy
nor
doubt
nor
fear
is
in
my
soul
a
letter
in
short
such
as
a
son
might
write
to
his
mother
aware
that
he
is
going
to
his
death
good
god
de
marsay
as
i
wrote
it
hell
was
in
my
soul
i
am
the
most
wretched
man
on
earth
yes
yes
to
you
the
cries
to
you
the
grinding
of
my
teeth
i
avow
myself
to
you
a
despairing
lover
i
would
rather
live
these
six
years
sweeping
the
streets
beneath
her
windows
than
return
a
millionaire
at
the
end
of
them
if
i
could
choose
i
suffer
agony
i
shall
pass
from
pain
to
pain
until
i
hear
from
you
that
you
will
take
the
trust
which
you
alone
can
fulfil
or
accomplish
oh
my
dear
de
marsay
this
woman
is
indispensable
to
my
life
she
is
my
sun
my
atmosphere
take
her
under
your
shield
and
buckler
keep
her
faithful
to
me
even
if
she
wills
it
not
yes
i
could
be
satisfied
with
a
be
her
guardian
her
chaperon
for
i
could
have
no
distrust
of
you
prove
to
her
that
in
betraying
me
she
would
do
a
low
and
vulgar
thing
and
be
no
better
than
the
common
run
of
women
tell
her
that
faithfulness
will
prove
her
lofty
spirit
she
probably
has
fortune
enough
to
continue
her
life
of
luxury
and
ease
but
if
she
lacks
a
pleasure
if
she
has
caprices
which
she
can
not
satisfy
be
her
banker
and
do
not
fear
i
return
with
wealth
but
after
all
these
fears
are
in
vain
natalie
is
an
angel
of
purity
and
virtue
when
felix
de
vandenesse
fell
deeply
in
love
with
her
and
began
to
show
her
certain
attentions
i
had
only
to
let
her
see
the
danger
and
she
instantly
thanked
me
so
affectionately
that
i
was
moved
to
tears
she
said
that
her
dignity
and
reputation
demanded
that
she
should
not
close
her
doors
abruptly
to
any
man
but
that
she
knew
well
how
to
dismiss
him
she
did
in
fact
receive
him
so
coldly
that
the
affair
all
ended
for
the
best
we
have
never
had
any
other
subject
of
dispute
if
indeed
a
friendly
talk
could
be
called
a
dispute
in
all
our
married
life
and
now
my
dear
henri
i
bid
you
farewell
in
the
spirit
of
a
man
misfortune
has
come
no
matter
what
the
cause
it
is
here
i
strip
to
meet
it
poverty
and
natalie
are
two
irreconcilable
terms
the
balance
may
be
close
between
my
assets
and
my
liabilities
but
no
one
shall
have
cause
to
complain
of
me
but
should
any
unforeseen
event
occur
to
imperil
my
honor
i
count
on
you
send
letters
under
cover
to
the
governor
of
india
at
calcutta
i
have
friendly
relations
with
his
family
and
some
one
there
will
care
for
all
letters
that
come
to
me
from
europe
dear
friend
i
hope
to
find
you
the
same
de
marsay
on
my
return
the
man
who
scoffs
at
everything
and
yet
is
receptive
of
the
feelings
of
others
when
they
accord
with
the
grandeur
he
is
conscious
of
in
himself
you
stay
in
paris
friend
but
when
you
read
these
words
i
shall
be
crying
out
to
carthage
the
marquis
henri
de
marsay
to
comte
paul
de
manerville
so
so
monsieur
le
comte
you
have
made
a
wreck
of
it
monsieur
l
ambassadeur
has
gone
to
the
bottom
are
these
the
fine
things
that
you
were
doing
why
paul
why
have
you
kept
away
from
me
if
you
had
said
a
single
word
my
poor
old
fellow
i
would
have
made
your
position
plain
to
you
your
wife
has
refused
me
her
endorsement
may
that
one
word
unseal
your
eyes
but
if
that
does
not
suffice
learn
that
your
notes
have
been
protested
at
the
instigation
of
a
sieur
lecuyer
formerly
to
maitre
solonet
a
notary
in
bordeaux
that
usurer
in
embryo
who
came
from
gascony
for
jobbery
is
the
proxy
of
your
very
honorable
who
is
the
actual
holder
of
your
notes
for
one
hundred
thousand
francs
on
which
i
am
told
that
worthy
woman
doled
out
to
you
only
seventy
thousand
compared
with
madame
evangelista
papa
gobseck
is
flannel
velvet
vanilla
cream
a
sleeping
draught
your
vineyard
of
is
to
fall
into
the
clutches
of
your
wife
to
whom
her
mother
pays
the
difference
between
the
price
it
goes
for
at
the
auction
sale
and
the
amount
of
her
dower
claim
upon
it
madame
evangelista
will
also
have
the
farms
at
guadet
and
grassol
and
the
mortgages
on
your
house
in
bordeaux
already
belong
to
her
in
the
names
of
straw
men
provided
by
solonet
thus
these
two
excellent
women
will
make
for
themselves
a
united
income
of
one
hundred
and
twenty
thousand
francs
a
year
out
of
your
misfortunes
and
forced
sale
of
property
added
to
the
revenue
of
some
thousand
on
the
which
these
cats
already
possess
the
endorsement
of
your
wife
was
not
needed
for
this
morning
the
said
sieur
lecuyer
came
to
offer
me
a
return
of
the
sum
i
had
lent
you
in
exchange
for
a
legal
transfer
of
my
rights
the
vintage
of
which
your
keeps
in
the
cellars
at
lanstrac
will
suffice
to
pay
me
these
two
women
have
calculated
evidently
that
you
are
now
upon
the
ocean
but
i
send
this
letter
by
courier
so
that
you
may
have
time
to
follow
the
advice
i
now
give
you
i
made
lecuyer
talk
i
disentangled
from
his
lies
his
language
and
his
reticence
the
threads
i
lacked
to
bring
to
light
the
whole
plot
of
the
domestic
conspiracy
hatched
against
you
this
evening
at
the
spanish
embassy
i
shall
offer
my
admiring
compliments
to
your
and
your
wife
i
shall
pay
court
to
madame
evangelista
i
intend
to
desert
you
basely
and
say
sly
things
to
your
discredit
nothing
openly
or
that
mascarille
in
petticoats
would
detect
my
purpose
how
did
you
make
her
such
an
enemy
that
is
what
i
want
to
know
if
you
had
had
the
wit
to
be
in
love
with
that
woman
before
you
married
her
daughter
you
would
be
peer
of
france
duc
de
manerville
and
possibly
ambassador
to
madrid
if
you
had
come
to
me
at
the
time
of
your
marriage
i
would
have
helped
you
to
analyze
and
know
the
women
to
whom
you
were
binding
yourself
out
of
our
mutual
observations
safety
might
have
been
yours
but
instead
of
that
these
women
judged
me
became
afraid
of
me
and
separated
us
if
you
had
not
stupidly
given
in
to
them
and
turned
me
the
cold
shoulder
they
would
never
have
been
able
to
ruin
you
your
wife
brought
on
the
coldness
between
us
instigated
by
her
mother
to
whom
she
wrote
two
letters
a
week
a
fact
to
which
you
paid
no
attention
i
recognized
my
paul
when
i
heard
that
detail
within
a
month
i
shall
be
so
intimate
with
your
that
i
shall
hear
from
her
the
reasons
of
the
hatred
which
she
feels
for
you
for
you
one
of
the
best
and
kindest
men
on
earth
did
she
hate
you
before
her
daughter
fell
in
love
with
felix
de
vandenesse
that
s
a
question
in
my
mind
if
i
had
not
taken
a
fancy
to
go
to
the
east
with
montriveau
ronquerolles
and
a
few
other
good
fellows
of
your
acquaintance
i
should
have
been
in
a
position
to
tell
you
something
about
that
affair
which
was
beginning
just
as
i
left
paris
i
saw
the
first
gleams
even
then
of
your
misfortune
but
what
gentleman
is
base
enough
to
open
such
a
subject
unless
appealed
to
who
shall
dare
to
injure
a
woman
or
break
that
illusive
mirror
in
which
his
friend
delights
in
gazing
at
the
fairy
scenes
of
a
happy
marriage
illusions
are
the
riches
of
the
heart
your
wife
dear
friend
is
i
believe
i
may
say
in
the
fullest
application
of
the
word
a
fashionable
woman
she
thinks
of
nothing
but
her
social
success
her
dress
her
pleasures
she
goes
to
opera
and
theatre
and
balls
she
rises
late
and
drives
to
the
bois
dines
out
or
gives
a
such
a
life
seems
to
me
for
women
very
much
what
war
is
for
men
the
public
sees
only
the
victors
it
forgets
the
dead
many
delicate
women
perish
in
this
conflict
those
who
come
out
of
it
have
iron
constitutions
consequently
no
heart
but
good
stomachs
there
lies
the
reason
of
the
cold
insensibility
of
social
life
fine
souls
keep
themselves
reserved
weak
and
tender
natures
succumb
the
rest
are
cobblestones
which
hold
the
social
organ
in
its
place
and
rounded
by
the
tide
but
never
your
wife
has
maintained
that
life
with
ease
she
looks
made
for
it
she
is
always
fresh
and
beautiful
to
my
mind
the
deduction
is
plain
she
has
never
loved
you
and
you
have
loved
her
like
a
madman
to
strike
out
love
from
that
siliceous
nature
a
man
of
iron
was
needed
after
standing
but
without
enduring
the
shock
of
lady
dudley
felix
was
the
fitting
mate
to
natalie
there
is
no
great
merit
in
divining
that
to
you
she
was
indifferent
in
love
with
her
yourself
you
have
been
incapable
of
perceiving
the
cold
nature
of
a
young
woman
whom
you
have
fashioned
and
trained
for
a
man
like
vandenesse
the
coldness
of
your
wife
if
you
perceived
it
you
set
down
with
the
stupid
jurisprudence
of
married
people
to
the
honor
of
her
reserve
and
her
innocence
like
all
husbands
you
thought
you
could
keep
her
virtuous
in
a
society
where
women
whisper
from
ear
to
ear
that
which
men
are
afraid
to
say
no
your
wife
has
liked
the
social
benefits
she
derived
from
marriage
but
the
private
burdens
of
it
she
found
rather
heavy
those
burdens
that
tax
was
you
seeing
nothing
of
all
this
you
have
gone
on
digging
your
abysses
to
use
the
hackneyed
words
of
rhetoric
and
covering
them
with
flowers
you
have
mildly
obeyed
the
law
which
rules
the
ruck
of
men
from
which
i
desired
to
protect
you
dear
fellow
only
one
thing
was
wanting
to
make
you
as
dull
as
the
bourgeois
deceived
by
his
wife
who
is
all
astonishment
or
wrath
and
that
is
that
you
should
talk
to
me
of
your
sacrifices
your
love
for
natalie
and
chant
that
psalm
ungrateful
would
she
be
if
she
betrayed
me
i
have
done
this
i
have
done
that
and
more
will
i
do
i
will
go
to
the
ends
of
the
earth
to
the
indies
for
her
sake
i
i
etc
my
dear
paul
have
you
never
lived
in
paris
have
you
never
had
the
honor
of
belonging
by
ties
of
friendship
to
henri
de
marsay
that
you
should
be
so
ignorant
of
the
commonest
things
the
primitive
principles
that
move
the
feminine
mechanism
the
of
their
hearts
then
hear
me
suppose
you
exterminate
yourself
suppose
you
go
to
for
a
woman
s
debts
suppose
you
kill
a
score
of
men
desert
a
dozen
women
serve
like
laban
cross
the
deserts
skirt
the
galleys
cover
yourself
with
glory
cover
yourself
with
shame
refuse
like
nelson
to
fight
a
battle
until
you
have
kissed
the
shoulder
of
lady
hamilton
dash
yourself
like
bonaparte
upon
the
bridge
at
arcola
go
mad
like
roland
risk
your
life
to
dance
five
minutes
with
a
woman
my
dear
fellow
what
have
all
those
things
to
do
with
if
love
were
won
by
samples
such
as
those
mankind
would
be
too
happy
a
spurt
of
prowess
at
the
moment
of
desire
would
give
a
man
the
woman
that
he
wanted
but
love
my
good
paul
is
a
faith
like
that
in
the
immaculate
conception
of
the
holy
virgin
it
comes
or
it
does
not
come
will
the
mines
of
potosi
or
the
shedding
of
our
blood
or
the
making
of
our
fame
serve
to
waken
an
involuntary
an
inexplicable
sentiment
young
men
like
you
who
expect
to
be
loved
as
the
balance
of
your
account
are
nothing
else
than
usurers
our
legitimate
wives
owe
us
virtue
and
children
but
they
don
t
owe
us
love
love
my
dear
paul
is
the
sense
of
pleasure
given
and
received
and
the
certainty
of
giving
and
receiving
it
love
is
a
desire
incessantly
moving
and
growing
incessantly
satisfied
and
insatiable
the
day
when
vandenesse
stirred
the
cord
of
a
desire
in
your
wife
s
heart
which
you
had
left
untouched
all
your
affection
your
gifts
your
deeds
your
money
ceased
to
be
even
memories
one
emotion
of
love
in
your
wife
s
heart
has
cast
out
the
treasures
of
your
own
passion
which
are
now
nothing
better
than
old
iron
felix
has
the
virtues
and
the
beauties
in
her
eyes
and
the
simple
moral
is
that
blinded
by
your
own
love
you
never
made
her
love
you
your
is
on
the
side
of
the
lover
against
the
husband
secretly
or
not
she
may
have
closed
her
eyes
or
she
may
have
opened
them
i
know
not
what
she
has
done
but
one
thing
is
certain
she
is
for
her
daughter
and
against
you
during
the
fifteen
years
that
i
have
observed
society
i
have
never
yet
seen
a
mother
who
under
such
circumstances
abandons
her
daughter
this
indulgence
seems
to
be
an
inheritance
transmitted
in
the
female
line
what
man
can
blame
it
some
copyist
of
the
civil
code
perhaps
who
sees
formulas
only
in
the
place
of
feelings
as
for
your
present
position
the
dissipation
into
which
the
life
of
a
fashionable
woman
cast
you
and
your
own
easy
nature
possibly
your
vanity
have
opened
the
way
for
your
wife
and
her
mother
to
get
rid
of
you
by
this
ruin
so
skilfully
contrived
from
all
of
which
you
will
conclude
my
good
friend
that
the
mission
you
entrusted
to
me
and
which
i
would
all
the
more
faithfully
fulfil
because
it
amused
me
is
necessarily
null
and
void
the
evil
you
wish
me
to
prevent
is
accomplished
consummatum
forgive
me
dear
friend
if
i
write
to
you
as
you
say
a
la
de
marsay
on
subjects
which
must
seem
to
you
very
serious
far
be
it
from
me
to
dance
upon
the
grave
of
a
friend
like
heirs
upon
that
of
a
progenitor
but
you
have
written
to
me
that
you
mean
to
act
the
part
of
a
man
and
i
believe
you
i
therefore
treat
you
as
a
man
of
the
world
and
not
as
a
lover
for
you
this
blow
ought
to
be
like
the
brand
on
the
shoulder
of
a
which
flings
him
forever
into
a
life
of
systematic
opposition
to
society
you
are
now
freed
of
one
evil
marriage
possessed
you
it
now
behooves
you
to
turn
round
and
possess
marriage
paul
i
am
your
friend
in
the
fullest
acceptation
of
the
word
if
you
had
a
brain
in
an
iron
skull
if
you
had
the
energy
which
has
come
to
you
too
late
i
would
have
proved
my
friendship
by
telling
you
things
that
would
have
made
you
walk
upon
humanity
as
upon
a
carpet
but
when
i
did
talk
to
you
guardedly
of
parisian
civilization
when
i
told
you
in
the
disguise
of
fiction
some
of
the
actual
adventures
of
my
youth
you
regarded
them
as
mere
romance
and
would
not
see
their
bearing
when
i
told
you
that
history
of
a
lawyer
at
the
galleys
branded
for
forgery
who
committed
the
crime
to
give
his
wife
adored
like
yours
an
income
of
thirty
thousand
francs
and
whom
his
wife
denounced
that
she
might
be
rid
of
him
and
free
to
love
another
man
you
exclaimed
and
other
fools
who
were
supping
with
us
exclaimed
against
me
well
my
dear
paul
you
were
that
lawyer
less
the
galleys
your
friends
here
are
not
sparing
you
the
sister
of
the
two
vandenesses
the
marquise
de
listomere
and
all
her
set
in
which
by
the
bye
that
little
rastignac
has
enrolled
himself
the
scamp
will
make
his
way
madame
d
aiglemont
and
her
salon
the
lenoncourts
the
comtesse
ferraud
madame
d
espard
the
nucingens
the
spanish
ambassador
in
short
all
the
cliques
in
society
are
flinging
mud
upon
you
you
are
a
bad
man
a
gambler
a
dissipated
fellow
who
has
squandered
his
property
after
paying
your
debts
a
great
many
times
your
wife
an
angel
of
virtue
has
just
redeemed
your
notes
for
one
hundred
thousand
francs
although
her
property
was
separate
from
yours
luckily
you
had
done
the
best
you
could
do
by
disappearing
if
you
had
stayed
here
you
would
have
made
her
bed
in
the
straw
the
poor
woman
would
have
been
the
victim
of
her
conjugal
devotion
when
a
man
attains
to
power
my
dear
paul
he
has
all
the
virtues
of
an
epitaph
let
him
fall
into
poverty
and
he
has
more
sins
than
the
prodigal
son
society
at
the
present
moment
gives
you
the
vices
of
a
don
juan
you
gambled
at
the
bourse
you
had
licentious
tastes
which
cost
you
fabulous
sums
of
money
to
gratify
you
paid
enormous
interests
to
the
two
vandenesses
have
told
everywhere
how
gigonnet
gave
you
for
six
thousand
francs
an
ivory
frigate
and
made
your
valet
buy
it
back
for
three
hundred
in
order
to
sell
it
to
you
again
the
incident
did
really
happen
to
maxime
de
trailles
about
nine
years
ago
but
it
fits
your
present
circumstances
so
well
that
maxime
has
forever
lost
the
command
of
his
frigate
in
short
i
can
t
tell
you
that
is
said
you
have
supplied
a
whole
encyclopaedia
of
gossip
which
the
women
have
an
interest
in
swelling
your
wife
is
having
an
immense
success
last
evening
at
the
opera
madame
firmiani
began
to
repeat
to
me
some
of
the
things
that
are
being
said
don
t
talk
of
that
i
replied
you
know
nothing
of
the
real
truth
you
people
paul
has
robbed
the
bank
cheated
the
treasury
murdered
ezzelin
and
three
medoras
in
the
rue
and
i
think
between
ourselves
that
he
is
a
member
of
the
his
associate
is
the
famous
jacques
collin
on
whom
the
police
have
been
unable
to
lay
a
hand
since
he
escaped
from
the
galleys
paul
gave
him
a
room
in
his
house
you
see
he
is
capable
of
anything
in
fact
the
two
have
gone
off
to
india
together
to
rob
the
great
madame
firmiani
like
the
distinguished
woman
that
she
is
saw
that
she
ought
not
to
convert
her
beautiful
lips
into
a
mouthpiece
for
false
denunciation
many
persons
when
they
hear
of
these
of
life
refuse
to
believe
them
they
take
the
side
of
human
nature
and
fine
sentiments
they
declare
that
these
things
do
not
exist
but
talleyrand
said
a
fine
thing
my
dear
fellow
all
things
truly
things
happen
under
our
very
noses
which
are
more
amazing
than
this
domestic
plot
of
yours
but
society
has
an
interest
in
denying
them
and
in
declaring
itself
calumniated
often
these
dramas
are
played
so
naturally
and
with
such
a
varnish
of
good
taste
that
even
i
have
to
rub
the
lens
of
my
to
see
to
the
bottom
of
them
but
i
repeat
to
you
when
a
man
is
a
friend
of
mine
when
we
have
received
together
the
baptism
of
champagne
and
have
knelt
together
before
the
altar
of
the
venus
commodus
when
the
crooked
fingers
of
play
have
given
us
their
benediction
if
that
man
finds
himself
in
a
false
position
i
d
ruin
a
score
of
families
to
do
him
justice
you
must
be
aware
from
all
this
that
i
love
you
have
i
ever
in
my
life
written
a
letter
as
long
as
this
no
therefore
read
with
attention
what
i
still
have
to
say
alas
paul
i
shall
be
forced
to
take
to
writing
for
i
am
taking
to
politics
i
am
going
into
public
life
i
intend
to
have
within
five
years
the
portfolio
of
a
ministry
or
some
embassy
there
comes
an
age
when
the
only
mistress
a
man
can
serve
is
his
country
i
enter
the
ranks
of
those
who
intend
to
upset
not
only
the
ministry
but
the
whole
present
system
of
government
in
short
i
swim
in
the
waters
of
a
certain
prince
who
is
lame
of
the
foot
only
a
man
whom
i
regard
as
a
statesman
of
genius
whose
name
will
go
down
to
posterity
a
prince
as
complete
in
his
way
as
a
great
artist
may
be
in
his
several
of
us
ronquerolles
montriveau
the
grandlieus
la
serisy
feraud
and
granville
have
allied
ourselves
against
the
as
the
represented
by
the
constitutionnel
has
ingeniously
said
we
intend
to
overturn
the
navarreins
lenoncourts
vandenesses
and
the
grand
almonry
in
order
to
succeed
we
shall
even
ally
ourselves
with
lafayette
the
orleanists
and
the
left
people
whom
we
can
throttle
on
the
morrow
of
victory
for
no
government
in
the
world
is
possible
with
their
principles
we
are
capable
of
anything
for
the
good
of
the
country
and
our
own
personal
questions
as
to
the
king
s
person
are
mere
sentimental
folly
in
these
days
they
must
be
cleared
away
from
that
point
of
view
the
english
with
their
sort
of
doge
are
more
advanced
than
we
are
politics
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
my
dear
fellow
politics
consist
in
giving
the
nation
an
impetus
by
creating
an
oligarchy
embodying
a
fixed
theory
of
government
and
able
to
direct
public
affairs
along
a
straight
path
instead
of
allowing
the
country
to
be
pulled
in
a
thousand
different
directions
which
is
what
has
been
happening
for
the
last
forty
years
in
our
beautiful
france
at
once
so
intelligent
and
so
sottish
so
wise
and
so
foolish
it
needs
a
system
indeed
much
more
than
men
what
are
individuals
in
this
great
question
if
the
end
is
a
great
one
if
the
country
may
live
happy
and
free
from
trouble
what
do
the
masses
care
for
the
profits
of
our
stewardship
our
fortune
privileges
and
pleasures
i
am
now
standing
firm
on
my
feet
i
have
at
the
present
moment
a
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
in
the
three
per
cents
and
a
reserve
of
two
hundred
thousand
francs
to
repair
damages
even
this
does
not
seem
to
me
very
much
ballast
in
the
pocket
of
a
man
starting
left
foot
foremost
to
scale
the
heights
of
power
a
fortunate
accident
settled
the
question
of
my
setting
out
on
this
career
which
did
not
particularly
smile
on
me
for
you
know
my
predilection
for
the
life
of
the
east
after
years
of
slumber
my
mother
woke
up
to
the
recollection
that
she
had
a
son
who
might
do
her
honor
often
when
a
is
eradicated
some
years
after
shoots
come
up
to
the
surface
of
the
ground
well
my
dear
boy
my
mother
had
almost
torn
me
up
by
the
roots
from
her
heart
and
i
sprouted
again
in
her
head
at
the
age
of
she
thinks
herself
old
enough
to
think
no
more
of
any
men
but
her
son
at
this
juncture
she
has
met
in
some
cauldron
at
i
know
not
what
baths
a
delightful
old
maid
english
with
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
like
a
good
mother
she
has
inspired
her
with
an
audacious
ambition
to
become
my
wife
a
maid
of
my
word
brought
up
in
the
strictest
puritanical
principles
a
steady
sitting
hen
who
maintains
that
unfaithful
wives
should
be
publicly
burnt
where
will
you
find
wood
enough
i
asked
her
i
could
have
sent
her
to
the
devil
for
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
a
year
are
no
equivalent
for
liberty
nor
a
fair
price
for
my
physical
and
moral
worth
and
my
prospects
but
she
is
the
sole
heiress
of
a
gouty
old
fellow
some
london
brewer
who
within
a
calculable
time
will
leave
her
a
fortune
equal
at
least
to
what
the
sweet
creature
has
already
added
to
these
advantages
she
has
a
red
nose
the
eyes
of
a
dead
goat
a
waist
that
makes
one
fear
lest
she
should
break
into
three
pieces
if
she
falls
down
and
the
coloring
of
a
badly
painted
doll
but
she
is
delightfully
economical
but
she
will
adore
her
husband
do
what
he
will
but
she
has
the
english
gift
she
will
manage
my
house
my
stables
my
servants
my
estates
better
than
any
steward
she
has
all
the
dignity
of
virtue
she
holds
herself
as
erect
as
a
confidante
on
the
stage
of
the
francais
nothing
will
persuade
me
that
she
has
not
been
impaled
and
the
shaft
broken
off
in
her
body
miss
stevens
is
however
fair
enough
to
be
not
too
unpleasing
if
i
must
positively
marry
her
but
and
this
to
me
is
truly
pathetic
she
has
the
hands
of
a
woman
as
immaculate
as
the
sacred
ark
they
are
so
red
that
i
have
not
yet
hit
on
any
way
to
whiten
them
that
will
not
be
too
costly
and
i
have
no
idea
how
to
fine
down
her
fingers
which
are
like
sausages
yes
she
evidently
belongs
to
the
by
her
hands
and
to
the
aristocracy
by
her
money
but
she
is
apt
to
affect
the
great
lady
a
little
too
much
as
rich
english
women
do
who
want
to
be
mistaken
for
them
and
she
displays
her
lobster
s
claws
too
freely
she
has
however
as
little
intelligence
as
i
could
wish
in
a
woman
if
there
were
a
stupider
one
to
be
found
i
would
set
out
to
seek
her
this
girl
whose
name
is
dinah
will
never
criticise
me
she
will
never
contradict
me
i
shall
be
her
upper
chamber
her
lords
and
commons
in
short
paul
she
is
indefeasible
evidence
of
the
english
genius
she
is
a
product
of
english
mechanics
brought
to
their
highest
pitch
of
perfection
she
was
undoubtedly
made
at
manchester
between
the
manufactory
of
perry
s
pens
and
the
workshops
for
it
eats
it
drinks
it
walks
it
may
have
children
take
good
care
of
them
and
bring
them
up
admirably
and
it
apes
a
woman
so
well
that
you
would
believe
it
real
when
my
mother
introduced
us
she
had
set
up
the
machine
so
cleverly
had
so
carefully
fitted
the
pegs
and
oiled
the
wheels
so
thoroughly
that
nothing
jarred
then
when
she
saw
i
did
not
make
a
very
wry
face
she
set
the
springs
in
motion
and
the
woman
spoke
finally
my
mother
uttered
the
decisive
words
miss
dinah
stevens
spends
no
more
than
thirty
thousand
francs
a
year
and
has
been
traveling
for
seven
years
in
order
to
so
there
is
another
image
and
that
one
is
silver
matters
are
so
far
advanced
that
the
banns
are
to
be
published
we
have
got
as
far
as
my
dear
miss
makes
eyes
at
me
that
might
floor
a
porter
the
settlements
are
prepared
my
fortune
is
not
inquired
into
miss
stevens
devotes
a
portion
of
hers
to
creating
an
entail
in
landed
estate
bearing
an
income
of
two
hundred
and
forty
thousand
francs
and
to
the
purchase
of
a
house
likewise
entailed
the
settlement
credited
to
me
is
of
a
million
francs
she
has
nothing
to
complain
of
i
leave
her
uncle
s
money
untouched
the
worthy
brewer
who
has
helped
to
found
the
entail
was
near
bursting
with
joy
when
he
heard
that
his
niece
was
to
be
a
marquise
he
would
be
capable
of
doing
something
handsome
for
my
eldest
boy
i
shall
sell
out
of
the
funds
as
soon
as
they
are
up
to
eighty
and
invest
in
land
thus
in
two
years
i
may
look
to
get
six
hundred
thousand
francs
a
year
out
of
real
estate
so
you
see
paul
i
do
not
give
my
friends
advice
that
i
am
not
ready
to
act
upon
if
you
had
but
listened
to
me
you
would
have
an
english
wife
some
nabob
s
daughter
who
would
leave
you
the
freedom
of
a
bachelor
and
the
independence
necessary
for
playing
the
whist
of
ambition
i
would
concede
my
future
wife
to
you
if
you
were
not
married
already
but
that
can
not
be
helped
and
i
am
not
the
man
to
bid
you
chew
the
cud
of
the
past
all
this
preamble
was
needful
to
explain
to
you
that
for
the
future
my
position
in
life
will
be
such
as
a
man
needs
if
he
wants
to
play
the
great
game
of
i
can
not
do
without
you
my
friend
now
then
my
dear
paul
instead
of
setting
sail
for
india
you
would
do
a
much
wiser
thing
to
navigate
with
me
the
waters
of
the
seine
believe
me
paris
is
still
the
place
where
fortune
abundant
fortune
can
be
won
potosi
is
in
the
rue
vivienne
the
rue
de
la
paix
the
place
vendome
the
rue
de
rivoli
in
all
other
places
and
countries
material
works
and
labors
marches
and
and
sweatings
of
the
brow
are
necessary
to
the
building
up
of
fortune
but
in
paris
suffices
here
every
man
even
mentally
mediocre
can
see
a
mine
of
wealth
as
he
puts
on
his
slippers
or
picks
his
teeth
after
dinner
in
his
and
his
find
me
another
place
on
the
globe
where
a
good
round
stupid
idea
brings
in
more
money
or
is
sooner
understood
than
it
is
here
if
i
reach
the
top
of
the
ladder
as
i
shall
am
i
the
man
to
refuse
you
a
helping
hand
an
influence
a
signature
we
shall
want
we
young
roues
a
faithful
friend
on
whom
to
count
if
only
to
compromise
him
and
make
him
a
or
send
him
to
die
like
a
common
soldier
to
save
his
general
government
is
impossible
without
a
man
of
honor
at
one
s
side
in
whom
to
confide
and
with
whom
we
can
do
and
say
everything
here
is
what
i
propose
let
the
sail
without
you
come
back
here
like
a
thunderbolt
i
ll
arrange
a
duel
for
you
with
vandenesse
in
which
you
shall
have
the
first
shot
and
you
can
wing
him
like
a
pigeon
in
france
the
husband
who
shoots
his
rival
becomes
at
once
respectable
and
respected
no
one
ever
cavils
at
him
again
fear
my
dear
fellow
is
a
valuable
social
element
a
means
of
success
for
those
who
lower
their
eyes
before
the
gaze
of
no
man
living
i
who
care
as
little
to
live
as
to
drink
a
glass
of
milk
and
who
have
never
felt
the
emotion
of
fear
i
have
remarked
the
strange
effects
produced
by
that
sentiment
upon
our
modern
manners
some
men
tremble
to
lose
the
enjoyments
to
which
they
are
attached
others
dread
to
leave
a
woman
the
old
adventurous
habits
of
other
days
when
life
was
flung
away
like
a
garment
exist
no
longer
the
bravery
of
a
great
many
men
is
nothing
more
than
a
clever
calculation
on
the
fear
of
their
adversary
the
poles
are
the
only
men
in
europe
who
fight
for
the
pleasure
of
fighting
they
cultivate
the
art
for
the
art
s
sake
and
not
for
speculation
now
hear
me
kill
vandenesse
and
your
wife
trembles
your
trembles
the
public
trembles
and
you
recover
your
position
you
prove
your
grand
passion
for
your
wife
you
subdue
society
you
subdue
your
wife
you
become
a
hero
such
is
france
as
for
your
embarrassments
i
hold
a
hundred
thousand
francs
for
you
you
can
pay
your
principal
debts
and
sell
what
property
you
have
left
with
a
power
of
redemption
for
you
will
soon
obtain
an
office
which
will
enable
you
by
degrees
to
pay
off
your
creditors
then
as
for
your
wife
once
enlightened
as
to
her
character
you
can
rule
her
when
you
loved
her
you
had
no
power
to
manage
her
not
loving
her
you
will
have
an
unconquerable
force
i
will
undertake
myself
to
make
your
as
supple
as
a
glove
for
you
must
recover
the
use
of
the
hundred
and
fifty
thousand
francs
a
year
those
two
women
have
squeezed
out
of
you
therefore
i
say
renounce
this
expatriation
which
seems
to
me
no
better
than
a
pan
of
charcoal
or
a
pistol
to
your
head
to
go
away
is
to
justify
all
calumnies
the
gambler
who
leaves
the
table
to
get
his
money
loses
it
when
he
returns
we
must
have
our
gold
in
our
pockets
let
us
now
you
and
i
be
two
gamblers
on
