of

to
the

samuel
william

president
of
trinity
college
oxford
my
dear
president
not
from
any
special
interest
which
i
anticipate
you
will
take
in
this
volume
or
any
sympathy
you
will
feel
in
its
argument
or
intrinsic
fitness
of
any
kind
in
my
associating
you
and
your
fellows
with
it
but
because
i
have
nothing
besides
it
to
offer
you
in
token
of
my
sense
of
the
gracious
compliment
which
you
and
they
have
paid
me
in
making
me
once
more
a
member
of
a
college
dear
to
me
from
undergraduate
memories
also
because
of
the
happy
coincidence
that
whereas
its
first
publication
was
contemporaneous
with
my
leaving
oxford
its
second
becomes
by
virtue
of
your
act
contemporaneous
with
a
recovery
of
my
position
there
therefore
it
is
that
without
your
leave
or
your
responsibility
i
take
the
bold
step
of
placing
your
name
in
the
first
pages
of
what
at
my
age
i
must
consider
the
last
print
or
reprint
on
which
i
shall
ever
be
engaged
i
am
my

sincerely

john

preface
to
the
edition
of
the
following
pages
were
not
in
the
first
instance
written
to
prove
the
divinity
of
the
catholic
religion
though
ultimately
they
furnish
a
positive
argument
in
its
behalf
but
to
explain
certain
difficulties
in
its
history
felt
before
now
by
the
author
himself
and
commonly
insisted
on
by
protestants
in
controversy
as
serving
to
blunt
the
force
of
its
and
general
claims
on
our
recognition
however
beautiful
and
promising
that
religion
is
in
theory
its
history
we
are
told
is
its
best
refutation
the
inconsistencies
found
age
after
age
in
its
teaching
being
as
patent
as
the
simultaneous
contrarieties
of
religious
opinion
manifest
in
the
high
low
and
broad
branches
of
the
church
of
england
in
reply
to
this
specious
objection
it
is
maintained
in
this
essay
that
granting
that
some
large
variations
of
teaching
in
its
long
course
of
years
exist
nevertheless
these
on
examination
will
be
found
to
arise
from
the
nature
of
the
case
and
to
proceed
on
a
law
and
with
a
harmony
and
a
definite
drift
and
with
an
analogy
to
scripture
revelations
which
instead
of
telling
to
their
disadvantage
actually
constitute
an
argument
in
their
favour
as
witnessing
to
a
superintending
providence
and
a
great
design
in
the
mode
and
in
the
circumstances
of
their
occurrence
perhaps
his
confidence
in
the
truth
and
availableness
of
this
view
has
sometimes
led
the
author
to
be
careless
and
in
his
concessions
to
protestants
of
historical
fact
if
this
be
so
anywhere
he
begs
the
reader
in
such
cases
to
understand
him
as
speaking
hypothetically
and
in
the
sense
of
an
ad
and
nor
is
such
hypothetical
reasoning
out
of
place
in
a
publication
which
is
addressed
not
to
theologians
but
to
those
who
as
yet
are
not
even
catholics
and
who
as
they
read
history
would
scoff
at
any
defence
of
catholic
doctrine
which
did
not
go
the
length
of
covering
admissions
in
matters
of
fact
as
broad
as
those
which
are
here
ventured
on
in
this
new
edition
of
the
essay
various
important
alterations
have
been
made
in
the
arrangement
of
its
separate
parts
and
some
not
indeed
in
its
matter
but
in
its
text
advertisement
to
the
first
edition
oculi
mei
defecerunt
in
salutare
tuum
it
is
now
above
eleven
years
since
the
writer
of
the
following
pages
in
one
of
the
early
numbers
of
the
tracts
for
the
times
expressed
himself
thus
considering
the
high
gifts
and
the
strong
claims
of
the
church
of
rome
and
her
dependencies
on
our
admiration
reverence
love
and
gratitude
how
could
we
withstand
her
as
we
do
how
could
we
refrain
from
being
melted
into
tenderness
and
rushing
into
communion
with
her
but
for
the
words
of
truth
which
bid
us
prefer
itself
to
the
whole
world
that
loveth
father
or
mother
more
than
me
is
not
worthy
of
me
how
could
we
learn
to
be
severe
and
execute
judgment
but
for
the
warning
of
moses
against
even
a
teacher
who
should
preach
new
gods
and
the
anathema
of
paul
even
against
angels
and
apostles
who
should
bring
in
a
new
doctrine
he
little
thought
when
he
so
wrote
that
the
time
would
ever
come
when
he
should
feel
the
obstacle
which
he
spoke
of
as
lying
in
the
way
of
communion
with
the
church
of
rome
to
be
destitute
of
solid
foundation
the
following
work
is
directed
towards
its
removal
having
in
former
publications
called
attention
to
the
supposed
difficulty
he
considers
himself
bound
to
avow
his
present
belief
that
it
is
imaginary
he
has
neither
the
ability
to
put
out
of
hand
a
finished
composition
nor
the
wish
to
make
a
powerful
and
moving
representation
on
the
great
subject
of
which
he
treats
his
aim
will
be
answered
if
he
succeeds
in
suggesting
thoughts
which
in
god
good
time
may
quietly
bear
fruit
in
the
minds
of
those
to
whom
that
subject
is
new
and
which
may
carry
forward
inquirers
who
have
already
put
themselves
on
the
course
if
at
times
his
tone
appears
positive
or
peremptory
he
hopes
this
will
be
imputed
to
the
scientific
character
of
the
work
which
requires
a
distinct
statement
of
principles
and
of
the
arguments
which
recommend
them
he
hopes
too
he
shall
be
excused
for
his
frequent
quotations
from
himself
which
are
necessary
in
order
to
show
how
he
stands
at
present
in
relation
to
various
of
his
former
publications
littlemore
postscript
since
the
above
was
written
the
author
has
joined
the
catholic
church
it
was
his
intention
and
wish
to
have
carried
his
volume
through
the
press
before
deciding
finally
on
this
step
but
when
he
had
got
some
way
in
the
printing
he
recognized
in
himself
a
conviction
of
the
truth
of
the
conclusion
to
which
the
discussion
leads
so
clear
as
to
supersede
further
deliberation
shortly
afterwards
circumstances
gave
him
the
opportunity
of
acting
upon
it
and
he
felt
that
he
had
no
warrant
for
refusing
to
do
so
his
first
act
on
his
conversion
was
to
offer
his
work
for
revision
to
the
proper
authorities
but
the
offer
was
declined
on
the
ground
that
it
was
written
and
partly
printed
before
he
was
a
catholic
and
that
it
would
come
before
the
reader
in
a
more
persuasive
form
if
he
read
it
as
the
author
wrote
it
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
add
that
he
now
submits
every
part
of
the
book
to
the
judgment
of
the
church
with
whose
doctrine
on
the
subjects
of
which
he
treats
he
wishes
all
his
thoughts
to
be
coincident

introduction
christianity
has
been
long
enough
in
the
world
to
justify
us
in
dealing
with
it
as
a
fact
in
the
world
history
its
genius
and
character
its
doctrines
precepts
and
objects
can
not
be
treated
as
matters
of
private
opinion
or
deduction
unless
we
may
reasonably
so
regard
the
spartan
institutions
or
the
religion
of
mahomet
it
may
indeed
legitimately
be
made
the
of
theories
what
is
its
moral
and
political
excellence
what
its
due
location
in
the
range
of
ideas
or
of
facts
which
we
possess
whether
it
be
divine
or
human
whether
original
or
eclectic
or
both
at
once
how
far
favourable
to
civilization
or
to
literature
whether
a
religion
for
all
ages
or
for
a
particular
state
of
society
these
are
questions
upon
the
fact
or
professed
solutions
of
the
fact
and
belong
to
the
province
of
opinion
but
to
a
fact
do
they
relate
on
an
admitted
fact
do
they
turn
which
must
be
ascertained
as
other
facts
and
surely
has
on
the
whole
been
so
ascertained
unless
the
testimony
of
so
many
centuries
is
to
go
for
nothing
christianity
is
no
theory
of
the
study
or
the
cloister
it
has
long
since
passed
beyond
the
letter
of
documents
and
the
reasonings
of
individual
minds
and
has
become
public
property
its
sound
has
gone
out
into
all
lands
and
its
words
unto
the
ends
of
the
world
it
has
from
the
first
had
an
objective
existence
and
has
thrown
itself
upon
the
great
concourse
of
men
its
home
is
in
the
world
and
to
know
what
it
is
we
must
seek
it
in
the
world
and
hear
the
world
witness
of
it
the
hypothesis
indeed
has
met
with
wide
reception
in
these
latter
times
that
christianity
does
not
fall
within
the
province
of
history
that
it
is
to
each
man
what
each
man
thinks
it
to
be
and
nothing
else
and
thus
in
fact
is
a
mere
name
for
a
cluster
or
family
of
rival
religions
all
together
religions
at
variance
one
with
another
and
claiming
the
same
appellation
not
because
there
can
be
assigned
any
one
and
the
same
doctrine
as
the
common
foundation
of
all
but
because
certain
points
of
agreement
may
be
found
here
and
there
of
some
sort
or
other
by
which
each
in
its
turn
is
connected
with
one
or
other
of
the
rest
or
again
it
has
been
maintained
or
implied
that
all
existing
denominations
of
christianity
are
wrong
none
representing
it
as
taught
by
christ
and
his
apostles
that
the
original
religion
has
gradually
decayed
or
become
hopelessly
corrupt
nay
that
it
died
out
of
the
world
at
its
birth
and
was
forthwith
succeeded
by
a
counterfeit
or
counterfeits
which
assumed
its
name
though
they
inherited
at
best
but
some
fragments
of
its
teaching
or
rather
that
it
can
not
even
be
said
either
to
have
decayed
or
to
have
died
because
historically
it
has
no
substance
of
its
own
but
from
the
first
and
onwards
it
has
on
the
stage
of
the
world
been
nothing
more
than
a
mere
assemblage
of
doctrines
and
practices
derived
from
without
from
oriental
platonic
polytheistic
sources
from
buddhism
essenism
manicheeism
or
that
allowing
true
christianity
still
to
exist
it
has
but
a
hidden
and
isolated
life
in
the
hearts
of
the
elect
or
again
as
a
literature
or
philosophy
not
certified
in
any
way
much
less
guaranteed
to
come
from
above
but
one
out
of
the
various
separate
informations
about
the
supreme
being
and
human
duty
with
which
an
unknown
providence
had
furnished
us
whether
in
nature
or
in
the
world
all
such
views
of
christianity
imply
that
there
is
no
sufficient
body
of
historical
proof
to
interfere
with
or
at
least
to
prevail
against
any
number
whatever
of
free
and
independent
hypotheses
concerning
it
but
this
surely
is
not
and
has
itself
to
be
proved
till
positive
reasons
grounded
on
facts
are
adduced
to
the
contrary
the
most
natural
hypotheses
the
most
agreeable
to
our
mode
of
proceeding
in
parallel
cases
and
that
which
takes
precedence
of
all
others
is
to
consider
that
the
society
of
christians
which
the
apostles
left
on
earth
were
of
that
religion
to
which
the
apostles
had
converted
them
that
the
external
continuity
of
name
profession
and
communion
argues
a
real
continuity
of
doctrine
that
as
christianity
began
by
manifesting
itself
as
of
a
certain
shape
and
bearing
to
all
mankind
therefore
it
went
on
so
to
manifest
itself
and
that
the
more
considering
that
prophecy
had
already
determined
that
it
was
to
be
a
power
visible
in
the
world
and
sovereign
over
it
characters
which
are
accurately
fulfilled
in
that
historical
christianity
to
which
we
commonly
give
the
name
it
is
not
a
violent
assumption
then
but
rather
mere
abstinence
from
the
wanton
admission
of
a
principle
which
would
necessarily
lead
to
the
most
vexatious
and
preposterous
scepticism
to
take
it
for
granted
before
proof
to
the
contrary
that
the
christianity
of
the
second
fourth
seventh
twelfth
sixteenth
and
intermediate
centuries
is
in
its
substance
the
very
religion
which
christ
and
his
apostles
taught
in
the
first
whatever
may
be
the
modifications
for
good
or
for
evil
which
lapse
of
years
or
the
vicissitudes
of
human
affairs
have
impressed
upon
it
of
course
i
do
not
deny
the
abstract
possibility
of
extreme
changes
the
substitution
is
certainly
in
idea
supposable
of
a
counterfeit
christianity
superseding
the
original
by
means
of
the
adroit
innovations
of
seasons
places
and
persons
till
according
to
the
familiar
illustration
the
blade
and
the
handle
are
alternately
renewed
and
identity
is
lost
without
the
loss
of
continuity
it
is
possible
but
it
must
not
be
assumed
the
is
with
those
who
assert
what
it
is
unnatural
to
expect
to
be
just
able
to
doubt
is
no
warrant
for
disbelieving
accordingly
some
writers
have
gone
on
to
give
reasons
from
history
for
their
refusing
to
appeal
to
history
they
aver
that
when
they
come
to
look
into
the
documents
and
literature
of
christianity
in
times
past
they
find
its
doctrines
so
variously
represented
and
so
inconsistently
maintained
by
its
professors
that
however
natural
it
be
it
is
useless
in
fact
to
seek
in
history
the
matter
of
that
revelation
which
has
been
vouchsafed
to
mankind
that
they
can
not
be
historical
christians
if
they
would
they
say
in
the
words
of
chillingworth
there
are
popes
against
popes
councils
against
councils
some
fathers
against
others
the
same
fathers
against
themselves
a
consent
of
fathers
of
one
age
against
a
consent
of
fathers
of
another
age
the
church
of
one
age
against
the
church
of
another
age
hence
they
are
forced
whether
they
will
or
not
to
fall
back
upon
the
bible
as
the
sole
source
of
revelation
and
upon
their
own
personal
private
judgment
as
the
sole
expounder
of
its
doctrine
this
is
a
fair
argument
if
it
can
be
maintained
and
it
brings
me
at
once
to
the
subject
of
this
essay
not
that
it
enters
into
my
purpose
to
convict
of
misstatement
as
might
be
done
each
separate
clause
of
this
sweeping
accusation
of
a
smart
but
superficial
writer
but
neither
on
the
other
hand
do
i
mean
to
deny
everything
that
he
says
to
the
disadvantage
of
historical
christianity
on
the
contrary
i
shall
admit
that
there
are
in
fact
certain
apparent
variations
in
its
teaching
which
have
to
be
explained
thus
i
shall
begin
but
then
i
shall
attempt
to
explain
them
to
the
exculpation
of
that
teaching
in
point
of
unity
directness
and
consistency
meanwhile
before
setting
about
this
work
i
will
address
one
remark
to
chillingworth
and
his
friends
let
them
consider
that
if
they
can
criticize
history
the
facts
of
history
certainly
can
retort
upon
them
it
might
i
grant
be
clearer
on
this
great
subject
than
it
is
this
is
no
great
concession
history
is
not
a
creed
or
a
catechism
it
gives
lessons
rather
than
rules
still
no
one
can
mistake
its
general
teaching
in
this
matter
whether
he
accept
it
or
stumble
at
it
bold
outlines
and
broad
masses
of
colour
rise
out
of
the
records
of
the
past
they
may
be
dim
they
may
be
incomplete
but
they
are
definite
and
this
one
thing
at
least
is
certain
whatever
history
teaches
whatever
it
omits
whatever
it
exaggerates
or
extenuates
whatever
it
says
and
unsays
at
least
the
christianity
of
history
is
not
protestantism
if
ever
there
were
a
safe
truth
it
is
this
and
protestantism
has
ever
felt
it
so
i
do
not
mean
that
every
writer
on
the
protestant
side
has
felt
it
for
it
was
the
fashion
at
first
at
least
as
a
rhetorical
argument
against
rome
to
appeal
to
past
ages
or
to
some
of
them
but
protestantism
as
a
whole
feels
it
and
has
felt
it
this
is
shown
in
the
determination
already
referred
to
of
dispensing
with
historical
christianity
altogether
and
of
forming
a
christianity
from
the
bible
alone
men
never
would
have
put
it
aside
unless
they
had
despaired
of
it
it
is
shown
by
the
long
neglect
of
ecclesiastical
history
in
england
which
prevails
even
in
the
english
church
our
popular
religion
scarcely
recognizes
the
fact
of
the
twelve
long
ages
which
lie
between
the
councils
of
nic√¶a
and
trent
except
as
affording
one
or
two
passages
to
illustrate
its
wild
interpretations
of
certain
prophesies
of
paul
and
john
it
is
melancholy
to
say
it
but
the
chief
perhaps
the
only
english
writer
who
has
any
claim
to
be
considered
an
ecclesiastical
historian
is
the
unbeliever
gibbon
to
be
deep
in
history
is
to
cease
to
be
a
protestant
and
this
utter
incongruity
between
protestantism
and
historical
christianity
is
a
plain
fact
whether
the
latter
be
regarded
in
its
earlier
or
in
its
later
centuries
protestants
can
as
little
bear
its
as
its
period
i
have
elsewhere
observed
on
this
circumstance
so
much
must
the
protestant
grant
that
if
such
a
system
of
doctrine
as
he
would
now
introduce
ever
existed
in
early
times
it
has
been
clean
swept
away
as
if
by
a
deluge
suddenly
silently
and
without
memorial
by
a
deluge
coming
in
a
night
and
utterly
soaking
rotting
heaving
up
and
hurrying
off
every
vestige
of
what
it
found
in
the
church
before
so
that
they
rose
in
the
morning
her
true
seed
all
dead
corpses
nay
dead
and
buried
and
without
gravestone
waters
went
over
them
there
was
not
one
of
them
left
they
sunk
like
lead
in
the
mighty
waters
strange
antitype
indeed
to
the
early
fortunes
of
israel
then
the
enemy
was
drowned
and
saw
them
dead
upon
the
but
now
it
would
seem
water
proceeded
as
a
flood
of
the
serpent
mouth
and
covered
all
the
witnesses
so
that
not
even
their
dead
bodies
lay
in
the
streets
of
the
great
city
let
him
take
which
of
his
doctrines
he
will
his
peculiar
view
of
of
formality
of
superstition
his
notion
of
faith
or
of
spirituality
in
religious
worship
his
denial
of
the
virtue
of
the
sacraments
or
of
the
ministerial
commission
or
of
the
visible
church
or
his
doctrine
of
the
divine
efficacy
of
the
scriptures
as
the
one
appointed
instrument
of
religious
teaching
and
let
him
consider
how
far
antiquity
as
it
has
come
down
to
us
will
countenance
him
in
it
no
he
must
allow
that
the
alleged
deluge
has
done
its
work
yes
and
has
in
turn
disappeared
itself
it
has
been
swallowed
up
by
the
earth
mercilessly
as
itself
was
merciless
that
protestantism
then
is
not
the
christianity
of
history
it
is
easy
to
determine
but
to
retort
is
a
poor
reply
in
controversy
to
a
question
of
fact
and
whatever
be
the
violence
or
the
exaggeration
of
writers
like
chillingworth
if
they
have
raised
a
real
difficulty
it
may
claim
a
real
answer
and
we
must
determine
whether
on
the
one
hand
christianity
is
still
to
represent
to
us
a
definite
teaching
from
above
or
whether
on
the
other
its
utterances
have
been
from
time
to
time
so
strangely
at
variance
that
we
are
necessarily
thrown
back
on
our
own
judgment
individually
to
determine
what
the
revelation
of
god
is
or
rather
if
in
fact
there
is
or
has
been
any
revelation
at
all
here
then
i
concede
to
the
opponents
of
historical
christianity
that
there
are
to
be
found
during
the
years
through
which
it
has
lasted
certain
apparent
inconsistencies
and
alterations
in
its
doctrine
and
its
worship
such
as
irresistibly
attract
the
attention
of
all
who
inquire
into
it
they
are
not
sufficient
to
interfere
with
the
general
character
and
course
of
the
religion
but
they
raise
the
question
how
they
came
about
and
what
they
mean
and
have
in
consequence
supplied
matter
for
several
hypotheses
of
these
one
is
to
the
effect
that
christianity
has
even
changed
from
the
first
and
ever
accommodates
itself
to
the
circumstances
of
times
and
seasons
but
it
is
difficult
to
understand
how
such
a
view
is
compatible
with
the
special
idea
of
revealed
truth
and
in
fact
its
advocates
more
or
less
abandon
or
tend
to
abandon
the
supernatural
claims
of
christianity
so
it
need
not
detain
us
here
a
second
and
more
plausible
hypothesis
is
that
of
the
anglican
divines
who
reconcile
and
bring
into
shape
the
exuberant
phenomena
under
consideration
by
cutting
off
and
casting
away
as
corruptions
all
usages
ways
opinions
and
tenets
which
have
not
the
sanction
of
primitive
times
they
maintain
that
history
first
presents
to
us
a
pure
christianity
in
east
and
west
and
then
a
corrupt
and
then
of
course
their
duty
is
to
draw
the
line
between
what
is
corrupt
and
what
is
pure
and
to
determine
the
dates
at
which
the
various
changes
from
good
to
bad
were
introduced
such
a
principle
of
demarcation
available
for
the
purpose
they
consider
they
have
found
in
the
of
vincent
of
lerins
that
revealed
and
apostolic
doctrine
is
quod
semper
quod
ubique
quod
ab
omnibus
a
principle
infallibly
separating
on
the
whole
field
of
history
authoritative
doctrine
from
opinion
rejecting
what
is
faulty
and
combining
and
forming
a
theology
that
christianity
is
what
has
been
held
always
everywhere
and
by
all
certainly
promises
a
solution
of
the
perplexities
an
interpretation
of
the
meaning
of
history
what
can
be
more
natural
than
that
divines
and
bodies
of
men
should
speak
sometimes
from
themselves
sometimes
from
tradition
what
more
natural
than
that
individually
they
should
say
many
things
on
impulse
or
under
excitement
or
as
conjectures
or
in
ignorance
what
more
certain
than
that
they
must
all
have
been
instructed
and
catechized
in
the
creed
of
the
apostles
what
more
evident
than
that
what
was
their
own
would
in
its
degree
be
peculiar
and
differ
from
what
was
similarly
private
and
personal
in
their
brethren
what
more
conclusive
than
that
the
doctrine
that
was
common
to
all
at
once
was
not
really
their
own
but
public
property
in
which
they
had
a
joint
interest
and
was
proved
by
the
concurrence
of
so
many
witnesses
to
have
come
from
an
apostolical
source
here
then
we
have
a
short
and
easy
method
for
bringing
the
various
informations
of
ecclesiastical
history
under
that
antecedent
probability
in
its
favour
which
nothing
but
its
actual
variations
would
lead
us
to
neglect
here
we
have
a
precise
and
satisfactory
reason
why
we
should
make
much
of
the
earlier
centuries
yet
pay
no
regard
to
the
later
why
we
should
admit
some
doctrines
and
not
others
why
we
refuse
the
creed
of
pius
iv
and
accept
the
articles
such
is
the
rule
of
historical
interpretation
which
has
been
professed
in
the
english
school
of
divines
and
it
contains
a
majestic
truth
and
offers
an
intelligible
principle
and
wears
a
reasonable
air
it
is
congenial
or
as
it
may
be
said
native
to
the
anglican
mind
which
takes
up
a
middle
position
neither
discarding
the
fathers
nor
acknowledging
the
pope
it
lays
down
a
simple
rule
by
which
to
measure
the
value
of
every
historical
fact
as
it
comes
and
thereby
it
provides
a
bulwark
against
rome
while
it
opens
an
assault
upon
protestantism
such
is
its
promise
but
its
difficulty
lies
in
applying
it
in
particular
cases
the
rule
is
more
serviceable
in
determining
what
is
not
than
what
is
christianity
it
is
irresistible
against
protestantism
and
in
one
sense
indeed
it
is
irresistible
against
rome
also
but
in
the
same
sense
it
is
irresistible
against
england
it
strikes
at
rome
through
england
it
admits
of
being
interpreted
in
one
of
two
ways
if
it
be
narrowed
for
the
purpose
of
disproving
the
catholicity
of
the
creed
of
pope
pius
it
becomes
also
an
objection
to
the
athanasian
and
if
it
be
relaxed
to
admit
the
doctrines
retained
by
the
english
church
it
no
longer
excludes
certain
doctrines
of
rome
which
that
church
denies
it
can
not
at
once
condemn
thomas
and
bernard
and
defend
athanasius
and
gregory
nazianzen
this
general
defect
in
its
serviceableness
has
been
heretofore
felt
by
those
who
appealed
to
it
it
was
said
by
one
writer
the
rule
of
vincent
is
not
of
a
mathematical
or
demonstrative
character
but
moral
and
requires
practical
judgment
and
good
sense
to
apply
it
for
instance
what
is
meant
by
being
does
it
mean
in
every
century
or
every
year
or
every
month
does
mean
in
every
country
or
in
every
diocese
and
does
of
require
us
to
produce
the
direct
testimony
of
every
one
of
them
how
many
fathers
how
many
places
how
many
instances
constitute
a
fulfilment
of
the
test
proposed
it
is
then
from
the
nature
of
the
case
a
condition
which
never
can
be
satisfied
as
fully
as
it
might
have
been
it
admits
of
various
and
unequal
application
in
various
instances
and
what
degree
of
application
is
enough
must
be
decided
by
the
same
principles
which
guide
us
in
the
conduct
of
life
which
determine
us
in
politics
or
trade
or
war
which
lead
us
to
accept
revelation
at
all
for
which
we
have
but
probability
to
show
at
most
nay
to
believe
in
the
existence
of
an
intelligent
creator
so
much
was
allowed
by
this
writer
but
then
he
added
this
character
indeed
of
vincent
canon
will
but
recommend
it
to
the
disciples
of
the
school
of
butler
from
its
agreement
with
the
analogy
of
nature
but
it
affords
a
ready
loophole
for
such
as
do
not
wish
to
be
persuaded
of
which
both
protestants
and
romanists
are
not
slow
to
avail
themselves
this
surely
is
the
language
of
disputants
who
are
more
intent
on
assailing
others
than
on
defending
themselves
as
if
similar
loopholes
were
not
necessary
for
anglican
theology
he
elsewhere
says
what
there
is
not
the
shadow
of
a
reason
for
saying
that
the
fathers
held
what
has
not
the
faintest
pretensions
of
being
a
catholic
truth
is
this
that
peter
or
his
successors
were
and
are
universal
bishops
that
they
have
the
whole
of
christendom
for
their
one
diocese
in
a
way
in
which
other
apostles
and
bishops
had
and
have
not
most
true
if
in
order
that
a
doctrine
be
considered
catholic
it
must
be
formally
stated
by
the
fathers
generally
from
the
very
first
but
on
the
same
understanding
the
doctrine
also
of
the
apostolical
succession
in
the
episcopal
order
has
not
the
faintest
pretensions
of
being
a
catholic
truth
nor
was
this
writer
without
a
feeling
of
the
special
difficulty
of
his
school
and
he
attempted
to
meet
it
by
denying
it
he
wished
to
maintain
that
the
sacred
doctrines
admitted
by
the
church
of
england
into
her
articles
were
taught
in
primitive
times
with
a
distinctness
which
no
one
could
fancy
to
attach
to
the
characteristic
tenets
of
rome
we
confidently
affirm
he
said
in
another
publication
that
there
is
not
an
article
in
the
athanasian
creed
concerning
the
incarnation
which
is
not
anticipated
in
the
controversy
with
the
gnostics
there
is
no
question
which
the
apollinarian
or
the
nestorian
heresy
raised
which
may
not
be
decided
in
the
words
of
ignatius
iren√¶us
and
tertullian
this
may
be
considered
as
true
it
may
be
true
also
or
at
least
shall
here
be
granted
as
true
that
there
is
also
a
in
the
church
for
the
doctrines
of
our
lord
consubstantiality
and
coeternity
with
the
almighty
father
let
us
allow
that
the
whole
circle
of
doctrines
of
which
our
lord
is
the
subject
was
consistently
and
uniformly
confessed
by
the
primitive
church
though
not
ratified
formally
in
council
but
it
surely
is
otherwise
with
the
catholic
doctrine
of
the
trinity
i
do
not
see
in
what
sense
it
can
be
said
that
there
is
a
of
primitive
divines
in
its
favour
which
will
not
avail
also
for
certain
doctrines
of
the
roman
church
which
will
presently
come
into
mention
and
this
is
a
point
which
the
writer
of
the
above
passages
ought
to
have
more
distinctly
brought
before
his
mind
and
more
carefully
weighed
but
he
seems
to
have
fancied
that
bishop
bull
proved
the
primitiveness
of
the
catholic
doctrine
concerning
the
holy
trinity
as
well
as
that
concerning
our
lord
now
it
should
be
clearly
understood
what
it
is
which
must
be
shown
by
those
who
would
prove
it
of
course
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
divinity
itself
partly
implies
and
partly
recommends
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
but
implication
and
suggestion
belong
to
another
class
of
arguments
which
has
not
yet
come
into
consideration
moreover
the
statements
of
a
particular
father
or
doctor
may
certainly
be
of
a
most
important
character
but
one
divine
is
not
equal
to
a
catena
we
must
have
a
whole
doctrine
stated
by
a
whole
church
the
catholic
truth
in
question
is
made
up
of
a
number
of
separate
propositions
each
of
which
if
maintained
to
the
exclusion
of
the
rest
is
a
heresy
in
order
then
to
prove
that
all
the
writers
taught
the
dogma
of
the
holy
trinity
it
is
not
enough
to
prove
that
each
still
has
gone
far
enough
to
be
only
a
heretic
not
enough
to
prove
that
one
has
held
that
the
son
is
god
for
so
did
the
sabellian
so
did
the
macedonian
and
another
that
the
father
is
not
the
son
for
so
did
the
arian
and
another
that
the
son
is
equal
to
the
father
for
so
did
the
tritheist
and
another
that
there
is
but
one
god
for
so
did
the
unitarian
not
enough
that
many
attached
in
some
sense
a
threefold
power
to
the
idea
of
the
almighty
for
so
did
almost
all
the
heresies
that
ever
existed
and
could
not
but
do
so
if
they
accepted
the
new
testament
at
all
but
we
must
show
that
all
these
statements
at
once
and
others
too
are
laid
down
by
as
many
separate
testimonies
as
may
fairly
be
taken
to
constitute
a
of
doctors
it
is
true
indeed
that
the
subsequent
profession
of
the
doctrine
in
the
universal
church
creates
a
presumption
that
it
was
held
even
before
it
was
professed
and
it
is
fair
to
interpret
the
early
fathers
by
the
later
this
is
true
and
admits
of
application
to
certain
other
doctrines
besides
that
of
the
blessed
trinity
in
unity
but
there
is
as
little
room
for
such
antecedent
probabilities
as
for
the
argument
from
suggestions
and
intimations
in
the
precise
and
imperative
semper
quod
ubique
quod
ab
as
it
is
commonly
understood
by
english
divines
and
is
by
them
used
against
the
later
church
and
the
see
of
rome
what
we
have
a
right
to
ask
if
we
are
bound
to
act
upon
vincent
rule
in
regard
to
the
trinitarian
dogma
is
a
sufficient
number
of
statements
each
distinctly
anticipating
the
athanasian
creed
now
let
us
look
at
the
leading
facts
of
the
case
in
appealing
to
which
i
must
not
be
supposed
to
be
ascribing
any
heresy
to
the
holy
men
whose
words
have
not
always
been
sufficiently
full
or
exact
to
preclude
the
imputation
first
the
creeds
of
that
early
day
make
no
mention
in
their
letter
of
the
catholic
doctrine
at
all
they
make
mention
indeed
of
a
three
but
that
there
is
any
mystery
in
the
doctrine
that
the
three
are
one
that
they
are
coequal
coeternal
all
increate
all
omnipotent
all
incomprehensible
is
not
stated
and
never
could
be
gathered
from
them
of
course
we
believe
that
they
imply
it
or
rather
intend
it
god
forbid
we
should
do
otherwise
but
nothing
in
the
mere
letter
of
those
documents
leads
to
that
belief
to
give
a
deeper
meaning
to
their
letter
we
must
interpret
them
by
the
times
which
came
after
again
there
is
one
and
one
only
great
doctrinal
council
in
times
it
was
held
at
antioch
in
the
middle
of
the
third
century
on
occasion
of
the
incipient
innovations
of
the
syrian
heretical
school
now
the
fathers
there
assembled
for
whatever
reason
condemned
or
at
least
withdrew
when
it
came
into
the
dispute
the
word
homo√ºsion
which
was
afterwards
received
at
nic√¶a
as
the
special
symbol
of
catholicism
against
arius
again
the
six
great
bishops
and
saints
of
the
church
were
iren√¶us
hippolytus
cyprian
gregory
thaumaturgus
dionysius
of
alexandria
and
methodius
of
these
dionysius
is
accused
by
st
basil
of
having
sown
the
first
seeds
of
arianism
and
gregory
is
allowed
by
the
same
learned
father
to
have
used
language
concerning
our
lord
which
he
only
defends
on
the
plea
of
an
economical
object
in
the
writer
hippolytus
speaks
as
if
he
were
ignorant
of
our
lord
eternal
sonship
methodius
speaks
incorrectly
at
least
upon
the
incarnation
and
cyprian
does
not
treat
of
theology
at
all
such
is
the
incompleteness
of
the
extant
teaching
of
these
true
saints
and
in
their
day
faithful
witnesses
of
the
eternal
son
again
athenagoras
clement
tertullian
and
the
two
ss
dionysii
would
appear
to
be
the
only
writers
whose
language
is
at
any
time
exact
and
systematic
enough
to
remind
us
of
the
athanasian
creed
if
we
limit
our
view
of
the
teaching
of
the
fathers
by
what
they
expressly
state
ignatius
may
be
considered
as
a
patripassian
justin
arianizes
and
hippolytus
is
a
photinian
again
there
are
three
great
theological
authors
of
the
centuries
tertullian
origen
and
we
may
add
eusebius
though
he
lived
some
way
into
the
fourth
tertullian
is
heterodox
on
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
divinity
and
indeed
ultimately
fell
altogether
into
heresy
or
schism
origen
is
at
the
very
least
suspected
and
must
be
defended
and
explained
rather
than
cited
as
a
witness
of
orthodoxy
and
eusebius
was
a
moreover
it
may
be
questioned
whether
any
father
distinctly
affirms
either
the
numerical
unity
or
the
coequality
of
the
three
persons
except
perhaps
the
heterodox
tertullian
and
that
chiefly
in
a
work
written
after
he
had
become
a
montanist
yet
to
satisfy
the
use
of
semper
surely
we
ought
not
to
be
left
for
these
great
articles
of
doctrine
to
the
testimony
of
a
later
age
further
bishop
bull
allows
that
nearly
all
the
ancient
catholics
who
preceded
arius
have
the
appearance
of
being
ignorant
of
the
invisible
and
incomprehensible
nature
of
the
son
of
god
an
article
expressly
taught
in
the
athanasian
creed
under
the
sanction
of
its
anathema
it
must
be
asked
moreover
how
much
direct
and
literal
testimony
the
fathers
give
one
by
one
to
the
divinity
of
the
holy
spirit
this
alone
shall
be
observed
that
st
basil
in
the
fourth
century
finding
that
if
he
distinctly
called
the
third
person
in
the
blessed
trinity
by
the
name
of
god
he
should
be
put
out
of
the
church
by
the
arians
pointedly
refrained
from
doing
so
on
an
occasion
on
which
his
enemies
were
on
the
watch
and
that
when
some
catholics
found
fault
with
him
athanasius
took
his
part
could
this
possibly
have
been
the
conduct
of
any
true
christian
not
to
say
saint
of
a
later
age
that
is
whatever
be
the
true
account
of
it
does
it
not
suggest
to
us
that
the
testimony
of
those
early
times
lies
very
unfavourably
for
the
application
of
the
rule
of
vincentius
let
it
not
be
for
a
moment
supposed
that
i
impugn
the
orthodoxy
of
the
early
divines
or
the
cogency
of
their
testimony
among
inquirers
but
i
am
trying
them
by
that
interpretation
of
vincentius
which
is
necessary
in
order
to
make
him
available
against
the
church
of
rome
and
now
as
to
the
positive
evidence
which
those
fathers
offer
in
behalf
of
the
catholic
doctrine
of
the
trinity
it
has
been
drawn
out
by
burton
and
seems
to
fall
under
two
heads
one
is
the
general
of
to
the
three
persons
together
both
by
fathers
and
churches
and
that
on
continuous
tradition
and
from
the
earliest
times
under
the
second
fall
certain
of
fathers
thus
we
find
the
word
trinity
used
by
theophilus
clement
hippolytus
tertullian
cyprian
origen
methodius
and
the
divine
the
most
distinctive
portion
of
the
catholic
doctrine
and
the
unity
of
power
or
again
of
substance
are
declared
with
more
or
less
distinctness
by
athenagoras
iren√¶us
clement
tertullian
hippolytus
origen
and
the
two
ss
dionysii
this
is
pretty
much
the
whole
of
the
evidence
perhaps
it
will
be
said
we
ought
to
take
the
fathers
as
a
whole
and
interpret
one
of
them
by
another
this
is
to
assume
that
they
are
all
of
one
school
which
of
course
they
are
but
which
in
controversy
is
a
point
to
be
proved
but
it
is
even
doubtful
whether
on
the
whole
such
a
procedure
would
strengthen
the
argument
for
instance
as
to
the
second
head
of
the
positive
evidence
noted
by
burton
tertullian
is
the
most
formal
and
elaborate
of
these
fathers
in
his
statements
of
the
catholic
doctrine
it
would
hardly
be
possible
says
burton
after
quoting
a
passage
for
athanasius
himself
or
the
compiler
of
the
athanasian
creed
to
have
delivered
the
doctrine
of
the
trinity
in
stronger
terms
than
these
yet
tertullian
must
be
considered
heterodox
on
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
eternal
generation
if
then
we
are
to
argue
from
his
instance
to
that
of
the
other
fathers
we
shall
be
driven
to
the
conclusion
that
even
the
most
exact
statements
are
worth
nothing
more
than
their
letter
are
a
warrant
for
nothing
beyond
themselves
and
are
consistent
with
heterodoxy
where
they
do
not
expressly
protest
against
it
and
again
as
to
the
argument
derivable
from
the
doxologies
it
must
not
be
forgotten
that
one
of
the
passages
in
justin
martyr
includes
the
worship
of
the
angels
we
worship
and
adore
he
says
him
and
the
son
who
came
from
him
and
taught
us
these
things
and
the
host
of
those
other
good
angels
who
follow
and
are
like
him
and
the
prophetic
spirit
a
unitarian
might
argue
from
this
passage
that
the
glory
and
worship
which
the
early
church
ascribed
to
our
lord
was
not
more
definite
than
that
which
justin
was
ready
to
concede
to
creatures
thus
much
on
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
let
us
proceed
to
another
example
there
are
two
doctrines
which
are
generally
associated
with
the
name
of
a
father
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
and
which
can
show
little
definite
or
at
least
but
partial
testimony
in
their
behalf
before
his
time
purgatory
and
original
sin
the
dictum
of
vincent
admits
both
or
excludes
both
according
as
it
is
or
is
not
rigidly
taken
but
if
used
by
aristotle
lesbian
rule
then
as
anglicans
would
wish
it
can
be
made
to
admit
original
sin
and
exclude
purgatory
on
the
one
hand
some
notion
of
suffering
or
disadvantage
or
punishment
after
this
life
in
the
case
of
the
faithful
departed
or
other
vague
forms
of
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
has
in
its
favour
almost
a
of
the
four
first
ages
of
the
church
though
some
fathers
state
it
with
far
greater
openness
and
decision
than
others
it
is
as
far
as
words
go
the
confession
of
clement
of
alexandria
tertullian
perpetua
cyprian
origen
lactantius
hilary
cyril
of
jerusalem
ambrose
st
basil
gregory
of
nazianzus
and
of
nyssa
chrysostom
jerome
paulinus
and
augustine
and
so
on
the
other
hand
there
is
a
certain
agreement
of
fathers
from
the
first
that
mankind
has
derived
some
disadvantage
from
the
sin
of
adam
next
when
we
consider
the
two
doctrines
more
distinctly
the
doctrine
that
between
death
and
judgment
there
is
a
time
or
state
of
punishment
and
the
doctrine
that
all
men
naturally
propagated
from
fallen
adam
are
in
consequence
born
destitute
of
original
righteousness
we
find
on
the
one
hand
several
such
as
tertullian
perpetua
cyril
hilary
jerome
gregory
nyssen
as
far
as
their
words
go
definitely
declaring
a
doctrine
of
purgatory
whereas
no
one
will
say
that
there
is
a
testimony
of
the
fathers
equally
strong
for
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
though
it
is
difficult
here
to
make
any
definite
statement
about
their
teaching
without
going
into
a
discussion
of
the
subject
on
the
subject
of
purgatory
there
were
to
speak
generally
two
schools
of
opinion
the
greek
which
contemplated
a
trial
of
fire
at
the
last
day
through
which
all
were
to
pass
and
the
african
resembling
more
nearly
the
present
doctrine
of
the
roman
church
and
so
there
were
two
principal
views
of
original
sin
the
greek
and
the
african
or
latin
of
the
greek
the
judgment
of
hooker
is
well
known
though
it
must
not
be
taken
in
the
letter
the
heresy
of
freewill
was
a
millstone
about
those
pelagians
neck
shall
we
therefore
give
sentence
of
death
inevitable
against
all
those
fathers
in
the
greek
church
which
being
mispersuaded
died
in
the
error
of
freewill
bishop
taylor
arguing
for
an
opposite
doctrine
bears
a
like
testimony
original
sin
he
says
as
it
is
at
this
day
commonly
explicated
was
not
the
doctrine
of
the
primitive
church
but
when
pelagius
had
puddled
the
stream
austin
was
so
angry
that
he
stamped
and
disturbed
it
more
and
truly
i
do
not
think
that
the
gentlemen
that
urged
against
me
austin
opinion
do
well
consider
that
i
profess
myself
to
follow
those
fathers
who
were
before
him
and
whom
austin
did
forsake
as
i
do
him
in
the
question
the
same
is
asserted
or
allowed
by
jansenius
petavius
and
walch
men
of
such
different
schools
that
we
may
surely
take
their
agreement
as
a
proof
of
the
fact
a
late
writer
after
going
through
the
testimonies
of
the
fathers
one
by
one
comes
to
the
conclusion
first
that
the
greek
church
in
no
point
favoured
augustine
except
in
teaching
that
from
adam
sin
came
death
and
after
the
time
of
methodius
an
extraordinary
and
unnatural
sensuality
also
next
that
the
latin
church
affirmed
in
addition
that
a
corrupt
and
contaminated
soul
and
that
by
generation
was
carried
on
to
his
posterity
and
lastly
that
neither
greeks
nor
latins
held
the
doctrine
of
imputation
it
may
be
observed
in
addition
that
in
spite
of
the
forcible
teaching
of
paul
on
the
subject
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
appears
neither
in
the
apostles
nor
the
nicene
creed
one
additional
specimen
shall
be
given
as
a
sample
of
many
others
i
betake
myself
to
one
of
our
altars
to
receive
the
blessed
eucharist
i
have
no
doubt
whatever
on
my
mind
about
the
gift
which
that
sacrament
contains
i
confess
to
myself
my
belief
and
i
go
through
the
steps
on
which
it
is
assured
to
me
the
presence
of
christ
is
here
for
it
follows
upon
consecration
and
consecration
is
the
prerogative
of
priests
and
priests
are
made
by
ordination
and
ordination
comes
in
direct
line
from
the
apostles
whatever
be
our
other
misfortunes
every
link
in
our
chain
is
safe
we
have
the
apostolic
succession
we
have
a
right
form
of
consecration
therefore
we
are
blessed
with
the
great
gift
here
the
question
rises
in
me
who
told
you
about
that
gift
i
answer
i
have
learned
it
from
the
fathers
i
believe
the
real
presence
because
they
bear
witness
to
it
ignatius
calls
it
medicine
of
immortality
iren√¶us
says
that
flesh
becomes
incorrupt
and
partakes
of
life
and
has
the
hope
of
the
resurrection
as
nourished
from
the
lord
body
and
blood
that
the
eucharist
made
up
of
two
things
an
earthly
and
an
heavenly
perhaps
origen
and
perhaps
magnes
after
him
say
that
it
is
not
a
type
of
our
lord
body
but
his
body
and
cyprian
uses
language
as
fearful
as
can
be
spoken
of
those
who
profane
it
i
cast
my
lot
with
them
i
believe
as
they
thus
i
reply
and
then
the
thought
comes
upon
me
a
second
time
and
do
not
the
same
ancient
fathers
bear
witness
to
another
doctrine
which
you
disown
are
you
not
as
a
hypocrite
listening
to
them
when
you
will
and
deaf
when
you
will
not
how
are
you
casting
your
lot
with
the
saints
when
you
go
but
with
them
for
of
whether
of
the
two
do
they
speak
the
more
frequently
of
the
real
presence
in
the
eucharist
or
of
the
pope
supremacy
you
accept
the
lesser
evidence
you
reject
the
greater
in
truth
scanty
as
the
notices
may
be
of
the
papal
supremacy
they
are
both
more
numerous
and
more
definite
than
the
adducible
testimonies
in
favour
of
the
real
presence
the
testimonies
to
the
latter
are
confined
to
a
few
passages
such
as
those
just
quoted
on
the
other
hand
of
a
passage
in
justin
bishop
kaye
remarks
le
nourry
infers
that
justin
maintained
the
doctrine
of
transubstantiation
it
might
in
my
opinion
be
more
plausibly
urged
in
favour
of
consubstantiation
since
justin
calls
the
consecrated
elements
bread
and
wine
though
not
common
bread
and
wine
we
may
therefore
conclude
that
when
he
calls
them
the
body
and
blood
of
christ
he
speaks
figuratively
clement
observes
the
same
author
says
that
the
scripture
calls
wine
a
mystic
of
the
holy
blood
clement
gives
various
interpretations
of
christ
expressions
in
john
vi
respecting
his
flesh
and
blood
but
in
no
instance
does
he
interpret
them
literally
his
notion
seems
to
have
been
that
by
partaking
of
the
bread
and
wine
in
the
eucharist
the
soul
of
the
believer
is
united
to
the
spirit
and
that
by
this
union
the
principle
of
immortality
is
imparted
to
the
flesh
it
has
been
suggested
by
some
says
waterland
that
tertullian
understood
john
vi
merely
of
faith
or
doctrine
or
spiritual
actions
and
it
is
strenuously
denied
by
others
after
quoting
the
passage
he
adds
all
that
one
can
justly
gather
from
this
confused
passage
is
that
tertullian
interpreted
the
bread
of
life
in
john
vi
of
the
word
which
he
sometimes
makes
to
be
vocal
and
sometimes
substantial
blending
the
ideas
in
a
very
perplexed
manner
so
that
he
is
no
clear
authority
for
construing
john
vi
of
doctrines
all
that
is
certain
is
that
he
supposes
the
word
made
flesh
the
word
incarnate
to
be
the
heavenly
bread
spoken
of
in
that
chapter
origen
general
observation
relating
to
that
chapter
is
that
it
must
not
be
literally
but
figuratively
understood
again
it
is
plain
enough
that
eusebius
followed
origen
in
this
matter
and
that
both
of
them
favoured
the
same
mystical
or
allegorical
construction
whether
constantly
and
uniformly
i
need
not
say
i
will
but
add
the
incidental
testimony
afforded
on
a
late
occasion
how
far
the
anglican
doctrine
of
the
eucharist
depends
on
the
times
before
the
nicene
council
how
far
on
the
times
after
it
may
be
gathered
from
the
circumstance
that
when
a
memorable
sermon
was
published
on
the
subject
out
of
about
one
hundred
and
forty
passages
from
the
fathers
appended
in
the
notes
not
in
formal
proof
but
in
general
illustration
only
fifteen
were
taken
from
writers
with
such
evidence
the
testimonies
which
may
be
cited
in
behalf
of
the
authority
of
the
holy
see
need
not
fear
a
comparison
faint
they
may
be
one
by
one
but
at
least
we
may
count
seventeen
of
them
and
they
are
various
and
are
drawn
from
many
times
and
countries
and
thereby
serve
to
illustrate
each
other
and
form
a
body
of
proof
whatever
objections
may
be
made
to
this
or
that
particular
fact
and
i
do
not
think
any
valid
ones
can
be
raised
still
on
the
whole
i
consider
that
a
cumulative
argument
rises
from
them
in
favour
of
the
ecumenical
and
the
doctrinal
authority
of
rome
stronger
than
any
argument
which
can
be
drawn
from
the
same
period
for
the
doctrine
of
the
real
presence
i
shall
have
occasion
to
enumerate
them
in
the
fourth
chapter
of
this
essay
if
it
be
said
that
the
real
presence
appears
by
the
liturgies
of
the
fourth
or
fifth
century
to
have
been
the
doctrine
of
the
earlier
since
those
very
forms
probably
existed
from
the
first
in
divine
worship
this
is
doubtless
an
important
truth
but
then
it
is
true
also
that
the
writers
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
fearlessly
assert
or
frankly
allow
that
the
prerogatives
of
rome
were
derived
from
apostolic
times
and
that
because
it
was
the
see
of
peter
moreover
if
the
resistance
of
cyprian
and
firmilian
to
the
church
of
rome
in
the
question
of
baptism
by
heretics
be
urged
as
an
argument
against
her
primitive
authority
or
the
earlier
resistance
of
polycrates
of
ephesus
let
it
be
considered
first
whether
all
authority
does
not
necessarily
lead
to
resistance
next
whether
cyprian
own
doctrine
which
is
in
favour
of
rome
is
not
more
weighty
than
his
act
which
is
against
her
thirdly
whether
he
was
not
already
in
error
in
the
main
question
under
discussion
and
firmilian
also
and
lastly
which
is
the
chief
point
here
whether
in
like
manner
we
may
not
object
on
the
other
hand
against
the
real
presence
the
words
of
tertullian
who
explains
this
is
my
body
by
a
figure
of
my
body
and
of
origen
who
speaks
of
our
drinking
blood
not
only
in
the
rite
of
the
sacraments
but
also
when
we
receive
his
discourses
and
says
that
that
bread
which
god
the
word
acknowledges
as
his
body
is
the
word
which
nourishes
souls
passages
which
admit
of
a
catholic
interpretation
when
the
catholic
doctrine
is
once
proved
but
which
run
counter
to
that
doctrine
it
does
not
seem
possible
then
to
avoid
the
conclusion
that
whatever
be
the
proper
key
for
harmonizing
the
records
and
documents
of
the
early
and
later
church
and
true
as
the
dictum
of
vincentius
must
be
considered
in
the
abstract
and
possible
as
its
application
might
be
in
his
own
age
when
he
might
almost
ask
the
primitive
centuries
for
their
testimony
it
is
hardly
available
now
or
effective
of
any
satisfactory
result
the
solution
it
offers
is
as
difficult
as
the
original
problem
another
hypothesis
for
accounting
for
a
want
of
accord
between
the
early
and
the
late
aspects
of
christianity
is
that
of
the
put
forward
on
the
assumption
that
there
has
been
no
variation
in
the
teaching
of
the
church
from
first
to
last
it
is
maintained
that
doctrines
which
are
associated
with
the
later
ages
of
the
church
were
really
in
the
church
from
the
first
but
not
publicly
taught
and
that
for
various
reasons
as
for
the
sake
of
reverence
that
sacred
subjects
might
not
be
profaned
by
the
heathen
and
for
the
sake
of
catechumens
that
they
might
not
be
oppressed
or
carried
away
by
a
sudden
communication
of
the
whole
circle
of
revealed
truth
and
indeed
the
fact
of
this
concealment
can
hardly
be
denied
in
whatever
degree
it
took
the
shape
of
a
definite
rule
which
might
vary
with
persons
and
places
that
it
existed
even
as
a
rule
as
regards
the
sacraments
seems
to
be
confessed
on
all
hands
that
it
existed
in
other
respects
as
a
practice
is
plain
from
the
nature
of
the
case
and
from
the
writings
of
the
apologists
minucius
felix
and
arnobius
in
controversy
with
pagans
imply
a
denial
that
then
the
christians
used
altars
yet
tertullian
speaks
expressly
of
the
in
the
church
what
can
we
say
but
that
the
apologists
deny
altars
the
in
which
they
ridicule
them
or
that
they
deny
that
altars
the
pagan
altars
were
tolerated
by
christians
and
in
like
manner
minucius
allows
that
there
were
no
temples
among
christians
yet
they
are
distinctly
recognized
in
the
edicts
of
the
dioclesian
era
and
are
known
to
have
existed
at
a
still
earlier
date
it
is
the
tendency
of
every
dominant
system
such
as
the
paganism
of
the
centuries
to
force
its
opponents
into
the
most
hostile
and
jealous
attitude
from
the
apprehension
which
they
naturally
feel
lest
if
they
acted
otherwise
in
those
points
in
which
they
approximate
towards
it
they
should
be
misinterpreted
and
overborne
by
its
authority
the
very
fault
now
found
with
clergymen
of
the
anglican
church
who
wish
to
conform
their
practices
to
her
rubrics
and
their
doctrines
to
her
divines
of
the
seventeenth
century
is
that
whether
they
mean
it
or
no
whether
legitimately
or
no
still
in
matter
of
fact
they
will
be
sanctioning
and
encouraging
the
religion
of
rome
in
which
there
are
similar
doctrines
and
practices
more
definite
and
more
influential
so
that
at
any
rate
it
is
inexpedient
at
the
moment
to
attempt
what
is
sure
to
be
mistaken
that
is
they
are
required
to
exercise
a
and
a
similar
reserve
was
inevitable
on
the
part
of
the
catholic
church
at
a
time
when
priests
and
altars
and
rites
all
around
it
were
devoted
to
malignant
and
incurable
superstitions
it
would
be
wrong
indeed
to
deny
but
it
was
a
duty
to
withhold
the
ceremonial
of
christianity
and
apologists
might
be
sometimes
tempted
to
deny
absolutely
what
at
furthest
could
only
be
denied
under
conditions
an
idolatrous
paganism
tended
to
repress
the
externals
of
christianity
as
at
this
day
the
presence
of
protestantism
is
said
to
repress
though
for
another
reason
the
exhibition
of
the
roman
catholic
religion
on
various
grounds
then
it
is
certain
that
portions
of
the
church
system
were
held
back
in
primitive
times
and
of
course
this
fact
goes
some
way
to
account
for
that
apparent
variation
and
growth
of
doctrine
which
embarrasses
us
when
we
would
consult
history
for
the
true
idea
of
christianity
yet
it
is
no
key
to
the
whole
difficulty
as
we
find
it
for
obvious
reasons
because
the
variations
continue
beyond
the
time
when
it
is
conceivable
that
the
discipline
was
in
force
and
because
they
manifest
themselves
on
a
law
not
abruptly
but
by
a
visible
growth
which
has
persevered
up
to
this
time
without
any
sign
of
its
coming
to
an
end
the
following
essay
is
directed
towards
a
solution
of
the
difficulty
which
has
been
stated
the
difficulty
as
far
as
it
exists
which
lies
in
the
way
of
our
using
in
controversy
the
testimony
of
our
most
natural
informant
concerning
the
doctrine
and
worship
of
christianity
viz
the
history
of
eighteen
hundred
years
the
view
on
which
it
is
written
has
at
all
times
perhaps
been
implicitly
adopted
by
theologians
and
i
believe
has
recently
been
illustrated
by
several
distinguished
writers
of
the
continent
such
as
de
maistre
and
m√∂hler
viz
that
the
increase
and
expansion
of
the
christian
creed
and
ritual
and
the
variations
which
have
attended
the
process
in
the
case
of
individual
writers
and
churches
are
the
necessary
attendants
on
any
philosophy
or
polity
which
takes
possession
of
the
intellect
and
heart
and
has
had
any
wide
or
extended
dominion
that
from
the
nature
of
the
human
mind
time
is
necessary
for
the
full
comprehension
and
perfection
of
great
ideas
and
that
the
highest
and
most
wonderful
truths
though
communicated
to
the
world
once
for
all
by
inspired
teachers
could
not
be
comprehended
all
at
once
by
the
recipients
but
as
being
received
and
transmitted
by
minds
not
inspired
and
through
media
which
were
human
have
required
only
the
longer
time
and
deeper
thought
for
their
full
elucidation
this
may
be
called
the
of
development
of
and
before
proceeding
to
treat
of
it
one
remark
may
be
in
place
it
is
undoubtedly
an
hypothesis
to
account
for
a
difficulty
but
such
too
are
the
various
explanations
given
by
astronomers
from
ptolemy
to
newton
of
the
apparent
motions
of
the
heavenly
bodies
and
it
is
as
unphilosophical
on
that
account
to
object
to
the
one
as
to
object
to
the
other
nor
is
it
more
reasonable
to
express
surprise
that
at
this
time
of
day
a
theory
is
necessary
granting
for
argument
sake
that
the
theory
is
novel
than
to
have
directed
a
similar
wonder
in
disparagement
of
the
theory
of
gravitation
or
the
plutonian
theory
in
geology
doubtless
the
theory
of
the
secret
and
the
theory
of
doctrinal
developments
are
expedients
and
so
is
the
dictum
of
vincentius
so
is
the
art
of
grammar
or
the
use
of
the
quadrant
it
is
an
expedient
to
enable
us
to
solve
what
has
now
become
a
necessary
and
an
anxious
problem
for
three
hundred
years
the
documents
and
the
facts
of
christianity
have
been
exposed
to
a
jealous
scrutiny
works
have
been
judged
spurious
which
once
were
received
without
a
question
facts
have
been
discarded
or
modified
which
were
once
first
principles
in
argument
new
facts
and
new
principles
have
been
brought
to
light
philosophical
views
and
polemical
discussions
of
various
tendencies
have
been
maintained
with
more
or
less
success
not
only
has
the
relative
situation
of
controversies
and
theologies
altered
but
infidelity
itself
is
in
a
different
i
am
obliged
to
say
in
a
more
hopeful
position
as
regards
christianity
the
facts
of
revealed
religion
though
in
their
substance
unaltered
present
a
less
compact
and
orderly
front
to
the
attacks
of
its
enemies
now
than
formerly
and
allow
of
the
introduction
of
new
inquiries
and
theories
concerning
its
sources
and
its
rise
the
state
of
things
is
not
as
it
was
when
an
appeal
lay
to
the
supposed
works
of
the
areopagite
or
to
the
primitive
decretals
or
to
dionysius
answers
to
paul
or
to
the
c≈ìna
domini
of
cyprian
the
assailants
of
dogmatic
truth
have
got
the
start
of
its
adherents
of
whatever
creed
philosophy
is
completing
what
criticism
has
begun
and
apprehensions
are
not
unreasonably
excited
lest
we
should
have
a
new
world
to
conquer
before
we
have
weapons
for
the
warfare
already
infidelity
has
its
views
and
conjectures
on
which
it
arranges
the
facts
of
ecclesiastical
history
and
it
is
sure
to
consider
the
absence
of
any
antagonist
theory
as
an
evidence
of
the
reality
of
its
own
that
the
hypothesis
here
to
be
adopted
accounts
not
only
for
the
athanasian
creed
but
for
the
creed
of
pope
pius
is
no
fault
of
those
who
adopt
it
no
one
has
power
over
the
issues
of
his
principles
we
can
not
manage
our
argument
and
have
as
much
of
it
as
we
please
and
no
more
an
argument
is
needed
unless
christianity
is
to
abandon
the
province
of
argument
and
those
who
find
fault
with
the
explanation
here
offered
of
its
historical
phenomena
will
find
it
their
duty
to
provide
one
for
themselves
and
as
no
special
aim
at
roman
catholic
doctrine
need
be
supposed
to
have
given
a
direction
to
the
inquiry
so
neither
can
a
reception
of
that
doctrine
be
immediately
based
on
its
results
it
would
be
the
work
of
a
life
to
apply
the
theory
of
developments
so
carefully
to
the
writings
of
the
fathers
and
to
the
history
of
controversies
and
councils
as
thereby
to
vindicate
the
reasonableness
of
every
decision
of
rome
much
less
can
such
an
undertaking
be
imagined
by
one
who
in
the
middle
of
his
days
is
beginning
life
again
thus
much
however
might
be
gained
even
from
an
essay
like
the
present
an
explanation
of
so
many
of
the
reputed
corruptions
doctrinal
and
practical
of
rome
as
might
serve
as
a

section
i
on
the
process
of
development
in
ideas
it
is
the
characteristic
of
our
minds
to
be
ever
engaged
in
passing
judgment
on
the
things
which
come
before
us
no
sooner
do
we
apprehend
than
we
judge
we
allow
nothing
to
stand
by
itself
we
compare
contrast
abstract
generalize
connect
adjust
classify
and
we
view
all
our
knowledge
in
the
associations
with
which
these
processes
have
invested
it
of
the
judgments
thus
made
which
become
aspects
in
our
minds
of
the
things
which
meet
us
some
are
mere
opinions
which
come
and
go
or
which
remain
with
us
only
till
an
accident
displaces
them
whatever
be
the
influence
which
they
exercise
meanwhile
others
are
firmly
fixed
in
our
minds
with
or
without
good
reason
and
have
a
hold
upon
us
whether
they
relate
to
matters
of
fact
or
to
principles
of
conduct
or
are
views
of
life
and
the
world
or
are
prejudices
imaginations
or
convictions
many
of
them
attach
to
one
and
the
same
object
which
is
thus
variously
viewed
not
only
by
various
minds
but
by
the
same
they
sometimes
lie
in
such
near
relation
that
each
implies
the
others
some
are
only
not
inconsistent
with
each
other
in
that
they
have
a
common
origin
some
as
being
actually
incompatible
with
each
other
are
one
or
other
falsely
associated
in
our
minds
with
their
object
and
in
any
case
they
may
be
nothing
more
than
ideas
which
we
mistake
for
things
thus
judaism
is
an
idea
which
once
was
objective
and
gnosticism
is
an
idea
which
was
never
so
both
of
them
have
various
aspects
those
of
judaism
were
such
as
monotheism
a
certain
ethical
discipline
a
ministration
of
divine
vengeance
a
preparation
for
christianity
those
of
the
gnostic
idea
are
such
as
the
doctrine
of
two
principles
that
of
emanation
the
intrinsic
malignity
of
matter
the
inculpability
of
sensual
indulgence
or
the
guilt
of
every
pleasure
of
sense
of
which
last
two
one
or
other
must
be
in
the
gnostic
a
false
aspect
and
subjective
only
the
idea
which
represents
an
object
or
supposed
object
is
commensurate
with
the
sum
total
of
its
possible
aspects
however
they
may
vary
in
the
separate
consciousness
of
individuals
and
in
proportion
to
the
variety
of
aspects
under
which
it
presents
itself
to
various
minds
is
its
force
and
depth
and
the
argument
for
its
reality
ordinarily
an
idea
is
not
brought
home
to
the
intellect
as
objective
except
through
this
variety
like
bodily
substances
which
are
not
apprehended
except
under
the
clothing
of
their
properties
and
results
and
which
admit
of
being
walked
round
and
surveyed
on
opposite
sides
and
in
different
perspectives
and
in
contrary
lights
in
evidence
of
their
reality
and
as
views
of
a
material
object
may
be
taken
from
points
so
remote
or
so
opposed
that
they
seem
at
first
sight
incompatible
and
especially
as
their
shadows
will
be
disproportionate
or
even
monstrous
and
yet
all
these
anomalies
will
disappear
and
all
these
contrarieties
be
adjusted
on
ascertaining
the
point
of
vision
or
the
surface
of
projection
in
each
case
so
also
all
the
aspects
of
an
idea
are
capable
of
coalition
and
of
a
resolution
into
the
object
to
which
it
belongs
and
the
dissimilitude
of
its
aspects
becomes
when
explained
an
argument
for
its
substantiveness
and
integrity
and
their
multiplicity
for
its
originality
and
power
there
is
no
one
aspect
deep
enough
to
exhaust
the
contents
of
a
real
idea
no
one
term
or
proposition
which
will
serve
to
define
it
though
of
course
one
representation
of
it
is
more
just
and
exact
than
another
and
though
when
an
idea
is
very
complex
it
is
allowable
for
the
sake
of
convenience
to
consider
its
distinct
aspects
as
if
separate
ideas
thus
with
all
our
intimate
knowledge
of
animal
life
and
of
the
structure
of
particular
animals
we
have
not
arrived
at
a
true
definition
of
any
one
of
them
but
are
forced
to
enumerate
properties
and
accidents
by
way
of
description
nor
can
we
inclose
in
a
formula
that
intellectual
fact
or
system
of
thought
which
we
call
the
platonic
philosophy
or
that
historical
phenomenon
of
doctrine
and
conduct
which
we
call
the
heresy
of
montanus
or
of
manes
again
if
protestantism
were
said
to
lie
in
its
theory
of
private
judgment
and
lutheranism
in
its
doctrine
of
justification
this
indeed
would
be
an
approximation
to
the
truth
but
it
is
plain
that
to
argue
or
to
act
as
if
the
one
or
the
other
aspect
were
a
sufficient
account
of
those
forms
of
religion
severally
would
be
a
serious
mistake
sometimes
an
attempt
is
made
to
determine
the
leading
idea
as
it
has
been
called
of
christianity
an
ambitious
essay
as
employed
on
a
supernatural
work
when
even
as
regards
the
visible
creation
and
the
inventions
of
man
such
a
task
is
beyond
us
thus
its
one
idea
has
been
said
by
some
to
be
the
restoration
of
our
fallen
race
by
others
philanthropy
by
others
the
tidings
of
immortality
or
the
spirituality
of
true
religious
service
or
the
salvation
of
the
elect
or
mental
liberty
or
the
union
of
the
soul
with
god
if
indeed
it
is
only
thereby
meant
to
use
one
or
other
of
these
as
a
central
idea
for
convenience
in
order
to
group
others
around
it
no
fault
can
be
found
with
such
a
proceeding
and
in
this
sense
i
should
myself
call
the
incarnation
the
central
aspect
of
christianity
out
of
which
the
three
main
aspects
of
its
teaching
take
their
rise
the
sacramental
the
hierarchical
and
the
ascetic
but
one
aspect
of
revelation
must
not
be
allowed
to
exclude
or
to
obscure
another
and
christianity
is
dogmatical
devotional
practical
all
at
once
it
is
esoteric
and
exoteric
it
is
indulgent
and
strict
it
is
light
and
dark
it
is
love
and
it
is
fear
when
an
idea
whether
real
or
not
is
of
a
nature
to
arrest
and
possess
the
mind
it
may
be
said
to
have
life
that
is
to
live
in
the
mind
which
is
its
recipient
thus
mathematical
ideas
real
as
they
are
can
hardly
properly
be
called
living
at
least
ordinarily
but
when
some
great
enunciation
whether
true
or
false
about
human
nature
or
present
good
or
government
or
duty
or
religion
is
carried
forward
into
the
public
throng
of
men
and
draws
attention
then
it
is
not
merely
received
passively
in
this
or
that
form
into
many
minds
but
it
becomes
an
active
principle
within
them
leading
them
to
an
contemplation
of
itself
to
an
application
of
it
in
various
directions
and
a
propagation
of
it
on
every
side
such
is
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
right
of
kings
or
of
the
rights
of
man
or
of
the
bearings
of
a
priesthood
or
utilitarianism
or
free
trade
or
the
duty
of
benevolent
enterprises
or
the
philosophy
of
zeno
or
epicurus
doctrines
which
are
of
a
nature
to
attract
and
influence
and
have
so
far
a
reality
that
they
may
be
looked
at
on
many
sides
and
strike
various
minds
very
variously
let
one
such
idea
get
possession
of
the
popular
mind
or
the
mind
of
any
portion
of
the
community
and
it
is
not
difficult
to
understand
what
will
be
the
result
at
first
men
will
not
fully
realize
what
it
is
that
moves
them
and
will
express
and
explain
themselves
inadequately
there
will
be
a
general
agitation
of
thought
and
an
action
of
mind
upon
mind
there
will
be
a
time
of
confusion
when
conceptions
and
misconceptions
are
in
conflict
and
it
is
uncertain
whether
anything
is
to
come
of
the
idea
at
all
or
which
view
of
it
is
to
get
the
start
of
the
others
new
lights
will
be
brought
to
bear
upon
the
original
statements
of
the
doctrine
put
forward
judgments
and
aspects
will
accumulate
after
a
while
some
definite
teaching
emerges
and
as
time
proceeds
one
view
will
be
modified
or
expanded
by
another
and
then
combined
with
a
third
till
the
idea
to
which
these
various
aspects
belong
will
be
to
each
mind
separately
what
at
first
it
was
only
to
all
together
it
will
be
surveyed
too
in
its
relation
to
other
doctrines
or
facts
to
other
natural
laws
or
established
customs
to
the
varying
circumstances
of
times
and
places
to
other
religions
polities
philosophies
as
the
case
may
be
how
it
stands
affected
towards
other
systems
how
it
affects
them
how
far
it
may
be
made
to
combine
with
them
how
far
it
tolerates
them
when
it
interferes
with
them
will
be
gradually
wrought
out
it
will
be
interrogated
and
criticized
by
enemies
and
defended
by
the
multitude
of
opinions
formed
concerning
it
in
these
respects
and
many
others
will
be
collected
compared
sorted
sifted
selected
rejected
gradually
attached
to
it
separated
from
it
in
the
minds
of
individuals
and
of
the
community
it
will
in
proportion
to
its
native
vigour
and
subtlety
introduce
itself
into
the
framework
and
details
of
social
life
changing
public
opinion
and
strengthening
or
undermining
the
foundations
of
established
order
thus
in
time
it
will
have
grown
into
an
ethical
code
or
into
a
system
of
government
or
into
a
theology
or
into
a
ritual
according
to
its
capabilities
and
this
body
of
thought
thus
laboriously
gained
will
after
all
be
little
more
than
the
proper
representative
of
one
idea
being
in
substance
what
that
idea
meant
from
the
first
its
complete
image
as
seen
in
a
combination
of
diversified
aspects
with
the
suggestions
and
corrections
of
many
minds
and
the
illustration
of
many
experiences
this
process
whether
it
be
longer
or
shorter
in
point
of
time
by
which
the
aspects
of
an
idea
are
brought
into
consistency
and
form
i
call
its
development
being
the
germination
and
maturation
of
some
truth
or
apparent
truth
on
a
large
mental
field
on
the
other
hand
this
process
will
not
be
a
development
unless
the
assemblage
of
aspects
which
constitute
its
ultimate
shape
really
belongs
to
the
idea
from
which
they
start
a
republic
for
instance
is
not
a
development
from
a
pure
monarchy
though
it
may
follow
upon
it
whereas
the
greek
tyrant
may
be
considered
as
included
in
the
idea
of
a
democracy
moreover
a
development
will
have
this
characteristic
that
its
action
being
in
the
busy
scene
of
human
life
it
can
not
progress
at
all
without
cutting
across
and
thereby
destroying
or
modifying
and
incorporating
with
itself
existing
modes
of
thinking
and
operating
the
development
then
of
an
idea
is
not
like
an
investigation
worked
out
on
paper
in
which
each
successive
advance
is
a
pure
evolution
from
a
foregoing
but
it
is
carried
on
through
and
by
means
of
communities
of
men
and
their
leaders
and
guides
and
it
employs
their
minds
as
its
instruments
and
depends
upon
them
while
it
uses
them
and
so
as
regards
existing
opinions
principles
measures
and
institutions
of
the
community
which
it
has
invaded
it
developes
by
establishing
relations
between
itself
and
them
it
employs
itself
in
giving
them
a
new
meaning
and
direction
in
creating
what
may
be
called
a
jurisdiction
over
them
in
throwing
off
whatever
in
them
it
can
not
assimilate
it
grows
when
it
incorporates
and
its
identity
is
found
not
in
isolation
but
in
continuity
and
sovereignty
this
it
is
that
imparts
to
the
history
both
of
states
and
of
religions
its
specially
turbulent
and
polemical
character
such
is
the
explanation
of
the
wranglings
whether
of
schools
or
of
parliaments
it
is
the
warfare
of
ideas
under
their
various
aspects
striving
for
the
mastery
each
of
them
enterprising
engrossing
imperious
more
or
less
incompatible
with
the
rest
and
rallying
followers
or
rousing
foes
according
as
it
acts
upon
the
faith
the
prejudices
or
the
interest
of
parties
or
classes
moreover
an
idea
not
only
modifies
but
is
modified
or
at
least
influenced
by
the
state
of
things
in
which
it
is
carried
out
and
is
dependent
in
various
ways
on
the
circumstances
which
surround
it
its
development
proceeds
quickly
or
slowly
as
it
may
be
the
order
of
succession
in
its
separate
stages
is
variable
it
shows
differently
in
a
small
sphere
of
action
and
in
an
extended
it
may
be
interrupted
retarded
mutilated
distorted
by
external
violence
it
may
be
enfeebled
by
the
effort
of
ridding
itself
of
domestic
foes
it
may
be
impeded
and
swayed
or
even
absorbed
by
counter
energetic
ideas
it
may
be
coloured
by
the
received
tone
of
thought
into
which
it
comes
or
depraved
by
the
intrusion
of
foreign
principles
or
at
length
shattered
by
the
development
of
some
original
fault
within
it
but
whatever
be
the
risk
of
corruption
from
intercourse
with
the
world
around
such
a
risk
must
be
encountered
if
a
great
idea
is
duly
to
be
understood
and
much
more
if
it
is
to
be
fully
exhibited
it
is
elicited
and
expanded
by
trial
and
battles
into
perfection
and
supremacy
nor
does
it
escape
the
collision
of
opinion
even
in
its
earlier
years
nor
does
it
remain
truer
to
itself
and
with
a
better
claim
to
be
considered
one
and
the
same
though
externally
protected
from
vicissitude
and
change
it
is
indeed
sometimes
said
that
the
stream
is
clearest
near
the
spring
whatever
use
may
fairly
be
made
of
this
image
it
does
not
apply
to
the
history
of
a
philosophy
or
belief
which
on
the
contrary
is
more
equable
and
purer
and
stronger
when
its
bed
has
become
deep
and
broad
and
full
it
necessarily
rises
out
of
an
existing
state
of
things
and
for
a
time
savours
of
the
soil
its
vital
element
needs
disengaging
from
what
is
foreign
and
temporary
and
is
employed
in
efforts
after
freedom
which
become
more
vigorous
and
hopeful
as
its
years
increase
its
beginnings
are
no
measure
of
its
capabilities
nor
of
its
scope
at
first
no
one
knows
what
it
is
or
what
it
is
worth
it
remains
perhaps
for
a
time
quiescent
it
tries
as
it
were
its
limbs
and
proves
the
ground
under
it
and
feels
its
way
from
time
to
time
it
makes
essays
which
fail
and
are
in
consequence
abandoned
it
seems
in
suspense
which
way
to
go
it
wavers
and
at
length
strikes
out
in
one
definite
direction
in
time
it
enters
upon
strange
territory
points
of
controversy
alter

around
it
dangers
and

appear
in

section
ii
on
the
kinds
of
development
in
ideas
to
attempt
an
accurate
analysis
or
complete
enumeration
of
the
processes
of
thought
whether
speculative
or
practical
which
come
under
the
notion
of
development
exceeds
the
pretensions
of
an
essay
like
the
present
but
without
some
general
view
of
the
various
mental
exercises
which
go
by
the
name
we
shall
have
no
security
against
confusion
in
our
reasoning
and
necessary
exposure
to
criticism
first
then
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
the
word
is
commonly
used
and
is
used
here
in
three
senses
indiscriminately
from
defect
of
our
language
on
the
one
hand
for
the
process
of
development
on
the
other
for
the
result
and
again
either
generally
for
a
development
true
or
not
true
that
is
faithful
or
unfaithful
to
the
idea
from
which
it
started
or
exclusively
for
a
development
deserving
the
name
a
false
or
unfaithful
development
is
more
properly
to
be
called
a
corruption
next
it
is
plain
that
developments
that
is
the
system
of
truths
drawn
out
from
mathematical
definitions
or
equations
do
not
fall
under
our
present
subject
though
altogether
analogous
to
it
there
can
be
no
corruption
in
such
developments
because
they
are
conducted
on
strict
demonstration
and
the
conclusions
in
which
they
terminate
being
necessary
can
not
be
declensions
from
the
original
idea
nor
of
course
do
developments
as
the
growth
of
animal
or
vegetable
nature
come
into
consideration
here
excepting
that
together
with
mathematical
they
may
be
taken
as
illustrations
of
the
general
subject
to
which
we
have
to
direct
our
attention
nor
have
we
to
consider
developments
which
though
effected
by
human
contrivance
are
still
physical
as
the
development
as
it
is
called
of
the
national
resources
we
speak
for
instance
of
ireland
the
united
states
or
the
valley
of
the
indus
as
admitting
of
a
great
development
by
which
we
mean
that
those
countries
have
fertile
tracts
or
abundant
products
or
broad
and
deep
rivers
or
central
positions
for
commerce
or
capacious
and
commodious
harbours
the
materials
and
instruments
of
wealth
and
these
at
present
turned
to
insufficient
account
development
in
this
case
will
proceed
by
establishing
marts
cutting
canals
laying
down
railroads
erecting
factories
forming
docks
and
similar
works
by
which
the
natural
riches
of
the
country
may
be
made
to
yield
the
largest
return
and
to
exert
the
greatest
influence
in
this
sense
art
is
the
development
of
nature
that
is
its
adaptation
to
the
purposes
of
utility
and
beauty
the
human
intellect
being
the
developing
power
when
society
and
its
various
classes
and
interests
are
the
of
the
ideas
which
are
in
operation
the
development
may
be
called
as
we
see
it
in
the
growth
of
states
or
the
changes
of
a
constitution
barbarians
descend
into
southern
regions
from
cupidity
and
their
warrant
is
the
sword
this
is
no
intellectual
process
nor
is
it
the
mode
of
development
exhibited
in
civilized
communities
where
civilization
exists
reason
in
some
shape
or
other
is
the
incentive
or
the
pretence
of
development
when
an
empire
enlarges
it
is
on
the
call
of
its
allies
or
for
the
balance
of
power
or
from
the
necessity
of
a
demonstration
of
strength
or
from
a
fear
for
its
frontiers
it
lies
uneasily
in
its
territory
it
is
it
has
unreal
deficient
communication
between
its
principal
points
or
defenceless
or
turbulent
neighbours
thus
of
old
time
eub≈ìa
was
necessary
for
athens
and
cythera
for
sparta
and
augustus
left
his
advice
as
a
legacy
to
confine
the
empire
between
the
atlantic
the
rhine
and
danube
the
euphrates
and
the
arabian
and
african
deserts
in
this
day
we
hear
of
the
rhine
being
the
natural
boundary
of
france
and
the
indus
of
our
eastern
empire
and
we
predict
that
in
the
event
of
a
war
prussia
will
change
her
outlines
in
the
map
of
europe
the
development
is
material
but
an
idea
gives
unity
and
force
to
its
movement
and
so
to
take
a
case
of
national
politics
a
late
writer
remarks
of
the
parliament
of
in
its
contest
with
charles
that
so
far
from
encroaching
on
the
just
powers
of
a
limited
monarch
it
never
hinted
at
the
securities
which
were
necessary
for
its
measures
however
twelve
years
more
of
repeated
aggressions
he
adds
taught
the
long
parliament
what
a
few
sagacious
men
might
perhaps
have
already
suspected
that
they
must
recover
more
of
their
ancient
constitution
from
oblivion
that
they
must
sustain
its
partial
weakness
by
new
securities
that
in
order
to
render
the
existence
of
monarchy
compatible
with
that
of
freedom
they
must
not
only
strip
it
of
all
it
had
usurped
but
of
something
that
was
its
own
whatever
be
the
worth
of
this
author
theory
his
facts
or
representations
are
an
illustration
of
a
political
development
again
at
the
present
day
that
ireland
should
have
a
population
of
one
creed
and
a
church
of
another
is
felt
to
be
a
political
arrangement
so
unsatisfactory
that
all
parties
seem
to
agree
that
either
the
population
will
develope
in
power
or
the
establishment
in
influence
political
developments
though
really
the
growth
of
ideas
are
often
capricious
and
irregular
from
the
nature
of
their
they
are
influenced
by
the
character
of
sovereigns
the
rise
and
fall
of
statesmen
the
fate
of
battles
and
the
numberless
vicissitudes
of
the
world
perhaps
the
greeks
would
be
still
involved
in
the
heresy
of
the
monophysites
says
gibbon
if
the
emperor
horse
had
not
fortunately
stumbled
theodosius
expired
his
orthodox
sister
succeeded
to
the
throne
again
it
often
happens
or
generally
that
various
distinct
and
incompatible
elements
are
found
in
the
origin
or
infancy
of
politics
or
indeed
of
philosophies
some
of
which
must
be
ejected
before
any
satisfactory
developments
if
any
can
take
place
and
they
are
commonly
ejected
by
the
gradual
growth
of
the
stronger
the
reign
of
charles
the
first
just
referred
to
supplies
an
instance
in
point
sometimes
discordant
ideas
are
for
a
time
connected
and
concealed
by
a
common
profession
or
name
such
is
the
case
of
coalitions
in
politics
and
comprehensions
in
religion
of
which
commonly
no
good
is
to
be
expected
such
is
an
ordinary
function
of
committees
and
boards
and
the
sole
aim
of
conciliations
and
concessions
to
make
contraries
look
the
same
and
to
secure
an
outward
agreement
where
there
is
no
other
unity
again
developments
reactions
reforms
revolutions
and
changes
of
various
kinds
are
mixed
together
in
the
actual
history
of
states
as
of
philosophical
sects
so
as
to
make
it
very
difficult
to
exhibit
them
in
any
scientific
analysis
often
the
intellectual
process
is
detached
from
the
practical
and
posterior
to
it
thus
it
was
after
elizabeth
had
established
the
reformation
that
hooker
laid
down
his
theory
of
church
and
state
as
one
and
the
same
differing
only
in
idea
and
after
the
revolution
and
its
political
consequences
that
warburton
wrote
his
alliance
and
now
again
a
new
theory
is
needed
for
the
constitutional
lawyer
in
order
to
reconcile
the
existing
political
state
of
things
with
the
just
claims
of
religion
and
so
again
in
parliamentary
conflicts
men
first
come
to
their
conclusions
by
the
external
pressure
of
events
or
the
force
of
principles
they
do
not
know
how
then
they
have
to
speak
and
they
look
about
for
arguments
and
a
pamphlet
is
published
on
the
subject
in
debate
or
an
article
appears
in
a
review
to
furnish
for
the
many
other
developments
though
political
are
strictly
subjected
and
consequent
to
the
ideas
of
which
they
are
the
exhibitions
thus
philosophy
was
a
real
guide
not
a
mere
defence
of
the
revolution
era
operating
forcibly
upon
church
and
government
in
and
after
his
day
such
too
were
the
theories
which
preceded
the
overthrow
of
the
old
regime
in
france
and
other
countries
at
the
end
of
the
last
century
again
perhaps
there
are
polities
founded
on
no
ideas
at
all
but
on
mere
custom
as
among
the
asiatics
in
other
developments
the
intellectual
character
is
so
prominent
that
they
may
even
be
called
as
in
the
anglican
doctrine
of
the
royal
supremacy
which
has
been
created
in
the
courts
of
law
not
in
the
cabinet
or
on
the
field
hence
it
is
carried
out
with
a
consistency
and
minute
application
which
the
history
of
constitutions
can
not
exhibit
it
does
not
only
exist
in
statutes
or
in
articles
or
in
oaths
it
is
realized
in
details
as
in
the
and
on
appointment
of
a
bishop
in
the
forms
observed
in
privy
council
on
the
issuing
of
state
prayers
in
certain
arrangements
observed
in
the
where
the
universal
or
abstract
church
precedes
the
king
but
the
national
or
really
existing
body
follows
him
in
printing
his
name
in
large
capitals
while
the
holiest
names
are
in
ordinary
type
and
in
fixing
his
arms
in
churches
instead
of
the
crucifix
moreover
perhaps
in
placing
sedition
privy
conspiracy
and
rebellion
before
false
doctrine
heresy
and
schism
in
the
litany
again
when
some
new
philosophy
or
its
instalments
are
introduced
into
the
measures
of
the
legislature
or
into
the
concessions
made
to
a
political
party
or
into
commercial
or
agricultural
policy
it
is
often
said
we
have
not
seen
the
end
of
this
it
is
an
earnest
of
future
concessions
our
children
will
see
we
feel
that
it
has
unknown
bearings
and
issues
the
admission
of
jews
to
municipal
offices
has
lately
been
defended
on
the
ground
that
it
is
the
introduction
of
no
new
principle
but
a
development
of
one
already
received
that
its
great
premisses
have
been
decided
long
since
and
that
the
present
age
has
but
to
draw
the
conclusion
that
it
is
not
open
to
us
to
inquire
what
ought
to
be
done
in
the
abstract
since
there
is
no
ideal
model
for
the
infallible
guidance
of
nations
that
change
is
only
a
question
of
time
and
that
there
is
a
time
for
all
things
that
the
application
of
principles
ought
not
to
go
beyond
the
actual
case
neither
preceding
nor
coming
after
an
imperative
demand
that
in
point
of
fact
jews
have
lately
been
chosen
for
offices
and
that
in
point
of
principle
the
law
can
not
refuse
to
legitimate
such
elections
another
class
of
developments
may
be
called
being
the
gradual
formation
of
opinion
concerning
persons
facts
and
events
judgments
which
were
at
one
time
confined
to
a
few
at
length
spread
through
a
community
and
attain
general
reception
by
the
accumulation
and
concurrence
of
testimony
thus
some
authoritative
accounts
die
away
others
gain
a
footing
and
are
ultimately
received
as
truths
courts
of
law
parliamentary
proceedings
newspapers
letters
and
other
posthumous
documents
the
industry
of
historians
and
biographers
and
the
lapse
of
years
which
dissipates
parties
and
prejudices
are
in
this
day
the
instruments
of
such
development
accordingly
the
poet
makes
truth
the
daughter
of
time
thus
at
length
approximations
are
made
to
a
right
appreciation
of
transactions
and
characters
history
can
not
be
written
except
in
an
thus
by
development
the
canon
of
the
new
testament
has
been
formed
thus
public
men
are
content
to
leave
their
reputation
to
posterity
great
reactions
take
place
in
opinion
nay
sometimes
men
outlive
opposition
and
obloquy
thus
saints
are
canonized
in
the
church
long
after
they
have
entered
into
their
rest
developments
are
not
properly
matter
for
argument
and
controversy
but
are
natural
and
personal
substituting
what
is
congruous
desirable
pious
appropriate
generous
for
strictly
logical
inference
bishop
butler
supplies
us
with
a
remarkable
instance
in
the
beginning
of
the
second
part
of
his
analogy
as
principles
imply
applications
and
general
propositions
include
particulars
so
he
tells
us
do
certain
relations
imply
correlative
duties
and
certain
objects
demand
certain
acts
and
feelings
he
observes
that
even
though
we
were
not
enjoined
to
pay
divine
honours
to
the
second
and
third
persons
of
the
holy
trinity
what
is
predicated
of
them
in
scripture
would
be
an
abundant
warrant
an
indirect
command
nay
a
ground
in
reason
for
doing
so
does
not
he
asks
the
duty
of
religious
regards
to
both
these
divine
persons
as
immediately
arise
to
the
view
of
reason
out
of
the
very
nature
of
these
offices
and
relations
as
the
inward
and
kind
intention
which
we
owe
to
our
arises
out
of
the
common
relations
between
us
and
them
he
proceeds
to
say
that
he
is
speaking
of
the
inward
religious
regards
of
reverence
honour
love
trust
gratitude
fear
hope
in
what
external
manner
this
inward
worship
is
to
be
expressed
is
a
matter
of
pure
revealed
command
but
the
worship
the
internal
worship
itself
to
the
son
and
holy
ghost
is
no
further
matter
of
pure
revealed
command
than
as
the
relations
they
stand
in
to
us
are
matter
of
pure
revelation
for
the
relations
being
known
the
obligations
to
such
internal
worship
are
obligations
of
reason
arising
out
of
those
relations
themselves
here
is
a
development
of
doctrine
into
worship
of
which
parallel
instances
are
obviously
to
be
found
in
the
church
of
rome
a
development
converse
to
that
which
butler
speaks
of
must
next
be
mentioned
as
certain
objects
excite
certain
emotions
and
sentiments
so
do
sentiments
imply
objects
and
duties
thus
conscience
the
existence
of
which
we
can
not
deny
is
a
proof
of
the
doctrine
of
a
moral
governor
which
alone
gives
it
a
meaning
and
a
scope
that
is
the
doctrine
of
a
judge
and
judgment
to
come
is
a
development
of
the
phenomenon
of
conscience
again
it
is
plain
that
passions
and
affections
are
in
action
in
our
minds
before
the
presence
of
their
proper
objects
and
their
activity
would
of
course
be
an
antecedent
argument
of
extreme
cogency
in
behalf
of
the
real
existence
of
those
legitimate
objects
supposing
them
unknown
and
so
again
the
social
principle
which
is
innate
in
us
gives
a
divine
sanction
to
society
and
to
civil
government
and
the
usage
of
prayers
for
the
dead
implies
certain
circumstances
of
their
state
upon
which
such
devotions
bear
and
rites
and
ceremonies
are
natural
means
through
which
the
mind
relieves
itself
of
devotional
and
penitential
emotions
and
sometimes
the
cultivation
of
awe
and
love
towards
what
is
great
high
and
unseen
has
led
a
man
to
the
abandonment
of
his
sect
for
some
more
catholic
form
of
doctrine
aristotle
furnishes
us
with
an
instance
of
this
kind
of
development
in
his
account
of
the
happy
man
after
showing
that
his
definition
of
happiness
includes
in
itself
the
pleasurable
which
is
the
most
obvious
and
popular
idea
of
happiness
he
goes
on
to
say
that
still
external
goods
are
necessary
to
it
about
which
however
the
definition
said
nothing
that
is
a
certain
prosperity
is
by
moral
fitness
not
by
logical
necessity
attached
to
the
happy
man
for
it
is
impossible
he
observes
or
not
easy
to
practise
high
virtue
without
abundant
means
many
deeds
are
done
by
the
instrumentality
of
friends
wealth
and
political
power
and
of
some
things
the
absence
is
a
cloud
upon
happiness
as
of
noble
birth
of
hopeful
children
and
of
personal
appearance
for
a
person
utterly
deformed
or
or
bereaved
and
childless
can
not
quite
be
happy
and
still
less
if
he
have
very
worthless
children
or
friends
or
they
were
good
and
died
this
process
of
development
has
been
well
delineated
by
a
living
french
writer
in
his
lectures
on
european
civilization
who
shall
be
quoted
at
some
length
if
we
reduce
religion
he
says
to
a
purely
religious
sentiment
it
appears
evident
that
it
must
and
ought
to
remain
a
purely
personal
concern
but
i
am
either
strangely
mistaken
or
this
religious
sentiment
is
not
the
complete
expression
of
the
religious
nature
of
man
religion
is
i
believe
very
different
from
this
and
much
more
extended
there
are
problems
in
human
nature
in
human
destinies
which
can
not
be
solved
in
this
life
which
depend
on
an
order
of
things
unconnected
with
the
visible
world
but
which
unceasingly
agitate
the
human
mind
with
a
desire
to
comprehend
them
the
solution
of
these
problems
is
the
origin
of
all
religion
her
primary
object
is
to
discover
the
creeds
and
doctrines
which
contain
or
are
supposed
to
contain
it
another
cause
also
impels
mankind
to
embrace
religion
from
whence
do
morals
originate
whither
do
they
lead
is
this
obligation
to
do
good
an
isolated
fact
without
an
author
without
an
end
does
it
not
conceal
or
rather
does
it
not
reveal
to
man
an
origin
a
destiny
beyond
this
world
the
science
of
morals
by
these
spontaneous
and
inevitable
questions
conducts
man
to
the
threshold
of
religion
and
displays
to
him
a
sphere
from
whence
he
has
not
derived
it
thus
the
certain
and
sources
of
religion
are
on
the
one
hand
the
problems
of
our
nature
on
the
other
the
necessity
of
seeking
for
morals
a
sanction
an
origin
and
an
aim
it
therefore
assumes
many
other
forms
beside
that
of
a
pure
sentiment
it
appears
a
union
of
doctrines
of
precepts
of
promises
this
is
what
truly
constitutes
religion
this
is
its
fundamental
character
it
is
not
merely
a
form
of
sensibility
an
impulse
of
the
imagination
a
variety
of
poetry
when
thus
brought
back
to
its
true
elements
to
its
essential
nature
religion
appears
no
longer
a
purely
personal
concern
but
a
powerful
and
fruitful
principle
of
association
is
it
considered
in
the
light
of
a
system
of
belief
a
system
of
dogmas
truth
is
not
the
heritage
of
any
individual
it
is
absolute
and
universal
mankind
ought
to
seek
and
profess
it
in
common
is
it
considered
with
reference
to
the
precepts
that
are
associated
with
its
doctrines
a
law
which
is
obligatory
on
a
single
individual
is
so
on
all
it
ought
to
be
promulgated
and
it
is
our
duty
to
endeavour
to
bring
all
mankind
under
its
dominion
it
is
the
same
with
respect
to
the
promises
that
religion
makes
in
the
name
of
its
creeds
and
precepts
they
ought
to
be
diffused
all
men
should
be
incited
to
partake
of
their
benefits
a
religious
society
therefore
naturally
results
from
the
essential
elements
of
religion
and
is
such
a
necessary
consequence
of
it
that
the
term
which
expresses
the
most
energetic
social
sentiment
the
most
intense
desire
to
propagate
ideas
and
extend
society
is
the
word
a
term
which
is
especially
applied
to
religious
belief
and
in
fact
consecrated
to
it
when
a
religious
society
has
ever
been
formed
when
a
certain
number
of
men
are
united
by
a
common
religious
creed
are
governed
by
the
same
religious
precepts
and
enjoy
the
same
religious
hopes
some
form
of
government
is
necessary
no
society
can
endure
a
week
nay
more
no
society
can
endure
a
single
hour
without
a
government
the
moment
indeed
a
society
is
formed
by
the
very
fact
of
its
formation
it
calls
forth
a
government
a
government
which
shall
proclaim
the
common
truth
which
is
the
bond
of
the
society
and
promulgate
and
maintain
the
precepts
that
this
truth
ought
to
produce
the
necessity
of
a
superior
power
of
a
form
of
government
is
involved
in
the
fact
of
the
existence
of
a
religious
as
it
is
in
that
of
any
other
society
and
not
only
is
a
government
necessary
but
it
naturally
forms
itself
when
events
are
suffered
to
follow
their
natural
laws
when
force
does
not
interfere
power
falls
into
the
hands
of
the
most
able
the
most
worthy
those
who
are
most
capable
of
carrying
out
the
principles
on
which
the
society
was
founded
is
a
warlike
expedition
in
agitation
the
bravest
take
the
command
is
the
object
of
the
association
learned
research
or
a
scientific
undertaking
the
best
informed
will
be
the
leader
the
inequality
of
faculties
and
influence
which
is
the
foundation
of
power
in
civil
life
has
the
same
effect
in
a
religious
society
religion
has
no
sooner
arisen
in
the
human
mind
than
a
religious
society
appears
and
immediately
a
religious
society
is
formed
it
produces
its
government
it
remains
to
allude
to
what
unless
the
word
were
often
so
vaguely
and
variously
used
i
should
be
led
to
call
developments
i
mean
such
as
are
a
mere
analysis
of
the
idea
contemplated
and
terminate
in
its
exact
and
complete
delineation
thus
aristotle
draws
the
character
of
a
magnanimous
or
of
a
munificent
man
thus
shakspeare
might
conceive
and
bring
out
his
hamlet
or
ariel
thus
walter
scott
gradually
enucleates
his
james
or
dalgetty
as
the
action
of
his
story
proceeds
and
thus
in
the
sacred
province
of
theology
the
mind
may
be
employed
in
developing
the
solemn
ideas
which
it
has
hitherto
held
implicitly
and
without
subjecting
them
to
its
reflecting
and
reasoning
powers
i
have
already
treated
of
this
subject
at
length
with
a
reference
to
the
highest
theological
subject
in
a
former
work
from
which
it
will
be
sufficient
here
to
quote
some
sentences
in
explanation
the
mind
which
is
habituated
to
the
thought
of
god
of
christ
of
the
holy
spirit
naturally
turns
with
a
devout
curiosity
to
the
contemplation
of
the
object
of
its
adoration
and
begins
to
form
statements
concerning
it
before
it
knows
whither
or
how
far
it
will
be
carried
one
proposition
necessarily
leads
to
another
and
a
second
to
a
third
then
some
limitation
is
required
and
the
combination
of
these
opposites
occasions
some
fresh
evolutions
from
the
original
idea
which
indeed
can
never
be
said
to
be
entirely
exhausted
this
process
is
its
development
and
results
in
a
series
or
rather
body
of
dogmatic
statements
till
what
was
an
impression
on
the
imagination
has
become
a
system
or
creed
in
the
reason
now
such
impressions
are
obviously
individual
and
complete
above
other
theological
ideas
because
they
are
the
impressions
of
objects
ideas
and
their
developments
are
commonly
not
identical
the
development
being
but
the
carrying
out
of
the
idea
into
its
consequences
thus
the
doctrine
of
penance
may
be
called
a
development
of
the
doctrine
of
baptism
yet
still
is
a
distinct
doctrine
whereas
the
developments
in
the
doctrines
of
the
holy
trinity
and
the
incarnation
are
mere
portions
of
the
original
impression
and
modes
of
representing
it
as
god
is
one
so
the
impression
which
he
gives
us
of
himself
is
one
it
is
not
a
thing
of
parts
it
is
not
a
system
nor
is
it
anything
imperfect
and
needing
a
counterpart
it
is
the
vision
of
an
object
when
we
pray
we
pray
not
to
an
assemblage
of
notions
or
to
a
creed
but
to
one
individual
being
and
when
we
speak
of
him
we
speak
of
a
person
not
of
a
law
or
manifestation
religious
men
according
to
their
measure
have
an
idea
or
vision
of
the
blessed
trinity
in
unity
of
the
son
incarnate
and
of
his
presence
not
as
a
number
of
qualities
attributes
and
actions
not
as
the
subject
of
a
number
of
propositions
but
as
one
and
individual
and
independent
of
words
like
an
impression
conveyed
through
the
senses
creeds
and
dogmas
live
in
the
one
idea
which
they
are
designed
to
express
and
which
alone
is
substantive
and
are
necessary
because
the
human
mind
can
not
reflect
upon
that
idea
except
piecemeal
can
not
use
it
in
its
oneness
and
entireness
or
without
resolving
it
into
a
series
of
aspects
and
relations
so
much
on
the
development
of
ideas
in
various
subject
matters
it
may
be
necessary
to
add
that
in
many
cases
simply
stands
for
as
in
some
of
the
instances
adduced
above
thus
both
calvinism
and
unitarianism
may
be
called
developments
that
is
exhibitions
of
the
principle
of
private
judgment
though
they
have
nothing
in
common
viewed
as
doctrines
as
to
christianity
supposing
the
truths
of
which
it
consists
to
admit
of
development
that
development
will
be
one
or
other
of
the
last
five
kinds
taking
the
incarnation
as
its
central
doctrine
the
episcopate
as
taught
by
ignatius
will
be
an
instance
of
political
development
the
of

determination
of

to

if
christianity
is
a

impresses
an
idea

itself
on
our

and
is
a
of
exercises
of
the
reason
that

will
in

expand
into
a

of
ideas

another
and
in
themselves
determinate
and
immutable
as
is
the
objective
fact
itself

is
thus
represented
it
is
a
characteristic
of
our
minds
that
they
can
not
take
an
object
in
which
is
submitted
to
them

and
integrally
we
conceive
by
means
of
definition
or
description
whole
objects
do
not

in
the
intellect
whole
ideas

are
to
use

mathematical
phrase
thrown
into

into
a

of
statements
strengthening
interpreting
correcting
each
other
and
with
more
or
less
exactness
approximating
as
they
accumulate
to
a
perfect
image
there
is
no
other
way
of
learning
or
of
teaching
we
can
not
teach
except
by
aspects
or
views
which
are
not
identical
with
the
thing
itself
which
we
are
teaching
two
persons
may
each
convey
the
same
truth
to
a
third
yet
by
methods
and
through
representations
altogether
different
the
same
person
will
treat
the
same
argument
differently
in
an
essay
or
speech
according
to
the
accident
of
the
day
of
writing
or
of
the
audience
yet
it
will
be
substantially
the
same
and
the
more
claim
an
idea
has
to
be
considered
living
the
more
various
will
be
its
aspects
and
the
more
social
and
political
is
its
nature
the
more
complicated
and
subtle
will
be
its
issues
and
the
longer
and
more
eventful
will
be
its
course
and
in
the
number
of
these
special
ideas
which
from
their
very
depth
and
richness
can
not
be
fully
understood
at
once
but
are
more
and
more
clearly
expressed
and
taught
the
longer
they
last
having
aspects
many
and
bearings
many
mutually
connected
and
growing
one
out
of
another
and
all
parts
of
a
whole
with
a
sympathy
and
correspondence
keeping
pace
with
the
necessities
of
the
world
multiform
prolific
and
ever
resourceful
among
these
great
doctrines
surely
we
christians
shall
not
refuse
a
foremost
place
to
christianity
such
previously
to
the
determination
of
the
fact
must
be
our
anticipation
concerning
it
from
a
contemplation
of
its
initial
achievements
it
may
be
objected
that
its
inspired
documents
at
once
determine
the
limits
of
its
mission
without
further
trouble
but
ideas
are
in
the
writer
and
reader
of
the
revelation
not
the
inspired
text
itself
and
the
question
is
whether
those
ideas
which
the
letter
conveys
from
writer
to
reader
reach
the
reader
at
once
in
their
completeness
and
accuracy
on
his
first
perception
of
them
or
whether
they
open
out
in
his
intellect
and
grow
to
perfection
in
the
course
of
time
nor
could
it
surely
be
maintained
without
extravagance
that
the
letter
of
the
new
testament
or
of
any
assignable
number
of
books
comprises
a
delineation
of
all
possible
forms
which
a
divine
message
will
assume
when
submitted
to
a
multitude
of
minds
nor
is
the
case
altered
by
supposing
that
inspiration
provided
in
behalf
of
the
first
recipients
of
the
revelation
what
the
divine
fiat
effected
for
herbs
and
plants
in
the
beginning
which
were
created
in
maturity
still
the
time
at
length
came
when
its
recipients
ceased
to
be
inspired
and
on
these
recipients
the
revealed
truths
would
fall
as
in
other
cases
at
first
vaguely
and
generally
though
in
spirit
and
in
truth
and
would
afterwards
be
completed
by
developments
nor
can
it
fairly
be
made
a
difficulty
that
thus
to
treat
of
christianity
is
to
level
it
in
some
sort
to
sects
and
doctrines
of
the
world
and
to
impute
to
it
the
imperfections
which
characterize
the
productions
of
man
certainly
it
is
a
sort
of
degradation
of
a
divine
work
to
consider
it
under
an
earthly
form
but
it
is
no
irreverence
since
our
lord
himself
its
author
and
guardian
bore
one
also
christianity
differs
from
other
religions
and
philosophies
in
what
is
superadded
to
earth
from
heaven
not
in
kind
but
in
origin
not
in
its
nature
but
in
its
personal
characteristics
being
informed
and
quickened
by
what
is
more
than
intellect
by
a
divine
spirit
it
is
externally
what
the
apostle
calls
an
earthen
vessel
being
the
religion
of
men
and
considered
as
such
it
grows
in
wisdom
and
stature
but
the
powers
which
it
wields
and
the
words
which
proceed
out
of
its
mouth
attest
its
miraculous
nativity
unless
then
some
special
ground
of
exception
can
be
assigned
it
is
as
evident
that
christianity
as
a
doctrine
and
worship
will
develope
in
the
minds
of
recipients
as
that
it
conforms
in
other
respects
in
its
external
propagation
or
its
political
framework
to
the
general
methods
by
which
the
course
of
things
is
carried
forward
again
if
christianity
be
an
universal
religion
suited
not
simply
to
one
locality
or
period
but
to
all
times
and
places
it
can
not
but
vary
in
its
relations
and
dealings
towards
the
world
around
it
that
is
it
will
develope
principles
require
a
very
various
application
according
as
persons
and
circumstances
vary
and
must
be
thrown
into
new
shapes
according
to
the
form
of
society
which
they
are
to
influence
hence
all
bodies
of
christians
orthodox
or
not
develope
the
doctrines
of
scripture
few
but
will
grant
that
luther
view
of
justification
had
never
been
stated
in
words
before
his
time
that
his
phraseology
and
his
positions
were
novel
whether
called
for
by
circumstances
or
not
it
is
equally
certain
that
the
doctrine
of
justification
defined
at
trent
was
in
some
sense
new
also
the
refutation
and
remedy
of
errors
can
not
precede
their
rise
and
thus
the
fact
of
false
developments
or
corruptions
involves
the
correspondent
manifestation
of
true
ones
moreover
all
parties
appeal
to
scripture
that
is
argue
from
scripture
but
argument
implies
deduction
that
is
development
here
there
is
no
difference
between
early
times
and
late
between
a
pope
and
an
individual
protestant
except
that
their
authority
is
not
on
a
par
on
either
side
the
claim
of
authority
is
the
same
and
the
process
of
development
accordingly
the
common
complaint
of
protestants
against
the
church
of
rome
is
not
simply
that
she
has
added
to
the
primitive
or
the
scriptural
doctrine
for
this
they
do
themselves
but
that
she
contradicts
it
and
moreover
imposes
her
additions
as
fundamental
truths
under
sanction
of
an
anathema
for
themselves
they
deduce
by
quite
as
subtle
a
method
and
act
upon
doctrines
as
implicit
and
on
reasons
as
little
analyzed
in
time
past
as
catholic
schoolmen
what
prominence
has
the
royal
supremacy
in
the
new
testament
or
the
lawfulness
of
bearing
arms
or
the
duty
of
public
worship
or
the
substitution
of
the
first
day
of
the
week
for
the
seventh
or
infant
baptism
to
say
nothing
of
the
fundamental
principle
that
the
bible
and
the
bible
only
is
the
religion
of
protestants
these
doctrines
and
usages
true
or
not
which
is
not
the
question
here
are
surely
not
gained
by
the
direct
use
and
immediate
application
of
scripture
nor
by
a
mere
exercise
of
argument
upon
words
and
sentences
placed
before
the
eyes
but
by
the
unconscious
growth
of
ideas
suggested
by
the
letter
and
habitual
to
the
mind
and
indeed
when
we
turn
to
the
consideration
of
particular
doctrines
on
which
scripture
lays
the
greatest
stress
we
shall
see
that
it
is
absolutely
impossible
for
them
to
remain
in
the
mere
letter
of
scripture
if
they
are
to
be
more
than
mere
words
and
to
convey
a
definite
idea
to
the
recipient
when
it
is
declared
that
the
word
became
flesh
three
wide
questions
open
upon
us
on
the
very
announcement
what
is
meant
by
the
word
what
by
flesh
what
by
became
the
answers
to
these
involve
a
process
of
investigation
and
are
developments
moreover
when
they
have
been
made
they
will
suggest
a
series
of
secondary
questions
and
thus
at
length
a
multitude
of
propositions
is
the
result
which
gather
round
the
inspired
sentence
of
which
they
come
giving
it
externally
the
form
of
a
doctrine
and
creating
or
deepening
the
idea
of
it
in
the
mind
it
is
true
that
so
far
as
such
statements
of
scripture
are
mysteries
they
are
relatively
to
us
but
words
and
can
not
be
developed
but
as
a
mystery
implies
in
part
what
is
incomprehensible
or
at
least
unknown
so
does
it
in
part
imply
what
is
not
so
it
implies
a
partial
manifestation
or
a
representation
by
economy
because
then
it
is
in
a
measure
understood
it
can
so
far
be
developed
though
each
result
in
the
process
will
partake
of
the
dimness
and
confusion
of
the
original
impression
this
moreover
should
be
considered
that
great
questions
exist
in
the
of
which
scripture
treats
which
scripture
does
not
solve
questions
too
so
real
so
practical
that
they
must
be
answered
and
unless
we
suppose
a
new
revelation
answered
by
means
of
the
revelation
which
we
have
that
is
by
development
such
is
the
question
of
the
canon
of
scripture
and
its
inspiration
that
is
whether
christianity
depends
upon
a
written
document
as
judaism
if
so
on
what
writings
and
how
many
whether
that
document
is
or
requires
a
comment
and
whether
any
authoritative
comment
or
commentator
is
provided
whether
the
revelation
and
the
document
are
commensurate
or
the
one
outruns
the
other
all
these
questions
surely
find
no
solution
on
the
surface
of
scripture
nor
indeed
under
the
surface
in
the
case
of
most
men
however
long
and
diligent
might
be
their
study
of
it
nor
were
these
difficulties
settled
by
authority
as
far
as
we
know
at
the
commencement
of
the
religion
yet
surely
it
is
quite
conceivable
that
an
apostle
might
have
dissipated
them
all
in
a
few
words
had
divine
wisdom
thought
fit
but
in
matter
of
fact
the
decision
has
been
left
to
time
to
the
slow
process
of
thought
to
the
influence
of
mind
upon
mind
the
issues
of
controversy
and
the
growth
of
opinion
to
take
another
instance
just
now
referred
to
if
there
was
a
point
on
which
a
rule
was
desirable
from
the
first
it
was
concerning
the
religious
duties
under
which
christian
parents
lay
as
regards
their
children
it
would
be
natural
indeed
in
any
christian
father
in
the
absence
of
a
rule
to
bring
his
children
for
baptism
such
in
this
instance
would
be
the
practical
development
of
his
faith
in
christ
and
love
for
his
offspring
still
a
development
it
is
necessarily
required
yet
as
far
as
we
know
not
provided
for
his
need
by
direct
precept
in
the
revelation
as
originally
given
another
very
large
field
of
thought
full
of
practical
considerations
yet
as
far
as
our
knowledge
goes
but
only
partially
occupied
by
any
apostolical
judgment
is
that
which
the
question
of
the
effects
of
baptism
opens
upon
us
that
they
who
came
in
repentance
and
faith
to
that
holy
sacrament
received
remission
of
sins
is
undoubtedly
the
doctrine
of
the
apostles
but
is
there
any
means
of
a
second
remission
for
sins
committed
after
it
paul
epistles
where
we
might
expect
an
answer
to
our
inquiry
contain
no
explicit
statement
on
the
subject
what
they
do
plainly
say
does
not
diminish
the
difficulty
first
that
baptism
is
intended
for
the
pardon
of
sins
before
it
not
in
prospect
next
that
those
who
have
received
the
gift
of
baptism
in
fact
live
in
a
state
of
holiness
not
of
sin
how
do
statements
such
as
these
meet
the
actual
state
of
the
church
as
we
see
it
at
this
day
considering
that
it
was
expressly
predicted
that
the
kingdom
of
heaven
like
the
fisher
net
should
gather
of
every
kind
and
that
the
tares
should
grow
with
the
wheat
until
the
harvest
a
graver
and
more
practical
question
can
not
be
imagined
than
that
which
it
has
pleased
the
divine
author
of
the
revelation
to
leave
undecided
unless
indeed
there
be
means
given
in
that
revelation
of
its
own
growth
or
development
as
far
as
the
letter
goes
of
the
inspired
message
every
one
who
holds
that
scripture
is
the
rule
of
faith
as
all
protestants
do
must
allow
that
there
is
not
one
of
us
but
has
exceeded
by
transgression
its
revealed
ritual
and
finds
himself
in
consequence
thrown
upon
those
infinite
resources
of
divine
love
which
are
stored
in
christ
but
have
not
been
drawn
out
into
form
in
the
appointments
of
the
gospel
since
then
scripture
needs
completion
the
question
is
brought
to
this
issue
whether
defect
or
inchoateness
in
its
doctrines
be
or
be
not
an
antecedent
probability
in
favour
of
a
development
of
them
there
is
another
subject
though
not
so
immediately
practical
on
which
scripture
does
not
strictly
speaking
keep
silence
but
says
so
little
as
to
require
and
so
much
as
to
suggest
information
beyond
its
letter
the
intermediate
state
between
death
and
the
resurrection
considering
the
long
interval
which
separates
christ
first
and
second
coming
the
millions
of
faithful
souls
who
are
waiting
it
out
and
the
intimate
concern
which
every
christian
has
in
the
determination
of
its
character
it
might
have
been
expected
that
scripture
would
have
spoken
explicitly
concerning
it
whereas
in
fact
its
notices
are
but
brief
and
obscure
we
might
indeed
have
argued
that
this
silence
of
scripture
was
intentional
with
a
view
of
discouraging
speculations
upon
the
subject
except
for
the
circumstance
that
as
in
the
question
of
our
state
its
teaching
seems
to
proceed
upon
an
hypothesis
inapplicable
to
the
state
of
the
church
after
the
time
when
it
was
delivered
as
scripture
contemplates
christians
not
as
backsliders
but
as
saints
so
does
it
apparently
represent
the
day
of
judgment
as
immediate
and
the
interval
of
expectation
as
evanescent
it
leaves
on
our
minds
the
general
impression
that
christ
was
returning
on
earth
at
once
the
time
short
worldly
engagements
superseded
by
the
present
distress
persecutors
urgent
christians
as
a
body
sinless
and
expectant
without
home
without
plan
for
the
future
looking
up
to
heaven
but
outward
circumstances
have
changed
and
with
the
change
a
different
application
of
the
revealed
word
has
of
necessity
been
demanded
that
is
a
development
when
the
nations
were
converted
and
offences
abounded
then
the
church
came
out
to
view
on
the
one
hand
as
a
temporal
establishment
on
the
other
as
a
remedial
system
and
passages
of
scripture
aided
and
directed
the
development
which
before
were
of
inferior
account
hence
the
doctrine
of
penance
as
the
complement
of
baptism
and
of
purgatory
as
the
explanation
of
the
intermediate
state
so
reasonable
is
this
expansion
of
the
original
creed
that
when
some
ten
years
since
the
true
doctrine
of
baptism
was
expounded
among
us
without
any
mention
of
penance
our
teacher
was
accused
by
many
of
us
of
novatianism
while
on
the
other
hand
heterodox
divines
have
before
now
advocated
the
doctrine
of
the
sleep
of
the
soul
because
they
said
it
was
the
only
successful
preventive
of
belief
in
purgatory
thus
developments
of
christianity
are
proved
to
have
been
in
the
contemplation
of
its
divine
author
by
an
argument
parallel
to
that
by
which
we
infer
intelligence
in
the
system
of
the
physical
world
in
whatever
sense
the
need
and
its
supply
are
a
proof
of
design
in
the
visible
creation
in
the
same
do
the
gaps
if
the
word
may
be
used
which
occur
in
the
structure
of
the
original
creed
of
the
church
make
it
probable
that
those
developments
which
grow
out
of
the
truths
which
lie
around
it
were
intended
to
fill
them
up
nor
can
it
be
fairly
objected
that
in
thus
arguing
we
are
contradicting
the
great
philosopher
who
tells
us
that
upon
supposition
of
god
affording
us
light
and
instruction
by
revelation
additional
to
what
he
has
afforded
us
by
reason
and
experience
we
are
in
no
sort
judges
by
what
methods
and
in
what
proportion
it
were
to
be
expected
that
this
supernatural
light
and
instruction
would
be
afforded
us
because
he
is
speaking
of
our
judging
before
a
revelation
is
given
he
observes
that
we
have
no
principles
of
reason
upon
which
to
judge
how
it
were
to
be
expected
revelation
should
have
been
left
or
what
was
most
suitable
to
the
divine
plan
of
government
in
various
respects
but
the
case
is
altogether
altered
when
a
revelation
is
vouchsafed
for
then
a
new
precedent
or
what
he
calls
principle
of
reason
is
introduced
and
from
what
is
actually
put
into
our
hands
we
can
form
a
judgment
whether
more
is
to
be
expected
butler
indeed
as
a
passage
of
his
work
shows
is
far
from
denying
the
principle
of
progressive
development
the
method
of
revelation
observed
in
scripture
abundantly
confirms
this
anticipation
for
instance
prophecy
if
it
had
so
happened
need
not
have
afforded
a
specimen
of
development
separate
predictions
might
have
been
made
to
accumulate
as
time
went
on
prospects
might
have
opened
definite
knowledge
might
have
been
given
by
communications
independent
of
each
other
as
john
gospel
or
the
epistles
of
paul
are
unconnected
with
the
first
three
gospels
though
the
doctrine
of
each
apostle
is
a
development
of
their
matter
but
the
prophetic
revelation
is
in
matter
of
fact
not
of
this
nature
but
a
process
of
development
the
earlier
prophecies
are
pregnant
texts
out
of
which
the
succeeding
announcements
grow
they
are
types
it
is
not
that
first
one
truth
is
told
then
another
but
the
whole
truth
or
large
portions
of
it
are
told
at
once
yet
only
in
their
rudiments
or
in
miniature
and
they
are
expanded
and
finished
in
their
parts
as
the
course
of
revelation
proceeds
the
seed
of
the
woman
was
to
bruise
the
serpent
head
the
sceptre
was
not
to
depart
from
judah
till
shiloh
came
to
whom
was
to
be
the
gathering
of
the
people
he
was
to
be
wonderful
counsellor
the
prince
of
peace
the
question
of
the
ethiopian
rises
in
the
reader
mind
of
whom
speaketh
the
prophet
this
every
word
requires
a
comment
accordingly
it
is
no
uncommon
theory
with
unbelievers
that
the
messianic
idea
as
they
call
it
was
gradually
developed
in
the
minds
of
the
jews
by
a
continuous
and
traditional
habit
of
contemplating
it
and
grew
into
its
full
proportions
by
a
mere
human
process
and
so
far
seems
certain
without
trenching
on
the
doctrine
of
inspiration
that
the
books
of
wisdom
and
ecclesiasticus
are
developments
of
the
writings
of
the
prophets
expressed
or
elicited
by
means
of
current
ideas
in
the
greek
philosophy
and
ultimately
adopted
and
ratified
by
the
apostle
in
his
epistle
to
the
hebrews
but
the
whole
bible
not
its
prophetical
portions
only
is
written
on
the
principle
of
development
as
the
revelation
proceeds
it
is
ever
new
yet
ever
old
john
who
completes
it
declares
that
he
writes
no
new
commandment
unto
his
brethren
but
an
old
commandment
which
they
had
from
the
beginning
and
then
he
adds
a
new
commandment
i
write
unto
you
the
same
test
of
development
is
suggested
in
our
words
on
the
mount
as
has
already
been
noticed
think
not
that
i
am
come
to
destroy
the
law
and
the
prophets
i
am
not
come
to
destroy
but
to
fulfil
he
does
not
reverse
but
perfect
what
has
gone
before
thus
with
respect
to
the
evangelical
view
of
the
rite
of
sacrifice
first
the
rite
is
enjoined
by
moses
next
samuel
says
to
obey
is
better
than
sacrifice
then
hosea
i
will
have
mercy
and
not
sacrifice
isaiah
incense
is
an
abomination
onto
me
then
malachi
describing
the
times
of
the
gospel
speaks
of
the
pure
offering
of
wheatflour
and
our
lord
completes
the
development
when
he
speaks
of
worshipping
in
spirit
and
in
truth
if
there
is
anything
here
left
to
explain
it
will
be
found
in
the
usage
of
the
christian
church
immediately
afterwards
which
shows
that
sacrifice
was
not
removed
but
truth
and
spirit
added
nay
the
of
our
lord
and
his
apostles
are
of
a
typical
structure
parallel
to
the
prophetic
announcements
above
mentioned
and
predictions
as
well
as
injunctions
of
doctrine
if
then
the
prophetic
sentences
have
had
that
development
which
has
really
been
given
them
first
by
succeeding
revelations
and
then
by
the
event
it
is
probable
antecedently
that
those
doctrinal
political
ritual
and
ethical
sentences
which
have
the
same
structure
should
admit
the
same
expansion
such
are
this
is
my
body
or
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
or
the
meek
shall
inherit
the
earth
or
suffer
little
children
to
come
unto
me
or
the
pure
in
heart
shall
see
god
on
this
character
of
our
lord
teaching
the
following
passage
may
suitably
be
quoted
from
a
writer
already
used
his
recorded
words
and
works
when
on
earth
come
to
us
as
the
declarations
of
a
lawgiver
in
the
old
covenant
almighty
god
first
of
all
spoke
the
ten
commandments
from
mount
sinai
and
afterwards
wrote
them
so
our
lord
first
spoke
his
own
gospel
both
of
promise
and
of
precept
on
the
mount
and
his
evangelists
have
recorded
it
further
when
he
delivered
it
he
spoke
by
way
of
parallel
to
the
ten
commandments
and
his
style
moreover
corresponds
to
the
authority
which
he
assumes
it
is
of
that
solemn
measured
and
severe
character
which
bears
on
the
face
of
it
tokens
of
its
belonging
to
one
who
spake
as
none
other
man
could
speak
the
beatitudes
with
which
his
sermon
opens
are
an
instance
of
this
incommunicable
style
which
befitted
as
far
as
human
words
could
befit
god
incarnate
nor
is
this
style
peculiar
to
the
sermon
on
the
mount
all
through
the
gospels
it
is
discernible
distinct
from
any
other
part
of
scripture
showing
itself
in
solemn
declarations
canons
sentences
or
sayings
such
as
legislators
propound
and
scribes
and
lawyers
comment
on
surely
everything
our
saviour
did
and
said
is
characterized
by
mingled
simplicity
and
mystery
his
emblematical
actions
his
typical
miracles
his
parables
his
replies
his
censures
all
are
evidences
of
a
legislature
in
germ
afterwards
to
be
developed
a
code
of
divine
truth
which
was
ever
to
be
before
men
eyes
to
be
the
subject
of
investigation
and
interpretation
and
the
guide
in
controversy
verily
i
say
unto
you
i
say
unto
you
are
the
tokens
of
a
supreme
teacher
and
prophet
and
thus
the
fathers
speak
of
his
teaching
sayings
observes
justin
short
and
concise
for
he
was
no
rhetorician
but
his
word
was
the
power
of
god
and
st
basil
in
like
manner
deed
and
every
word
of
our
saviour
jesus
christ
is
a
canon
of
piety
and
virtue
when
then
thou
hearest
word
or
deed
of
his
do
not
hear
it
as
by
the
way
or
after
a
simple
and
carnal
manner
but
enter
into
the
depth
of
his
contemplations
become
a
communicant
in
truths
mystically
delivered
to
thee
moreover
while
it
is
certain
that
developments
of
revelation
proceeded
all
through
the
old
dispensation
down
to
the
very
end
of
our
ministry
on
the
other
hand
if
we
turn
our
attention
to
the
beginnings
of
apostolical
teaching
after
his
ascension
we
shall
find
ourselves
unable
to
fix
an
historical
point
at
which
the
growth
of
doctrine
ceased
and
the
rule
of
faith
was
once
for
all
settled
not
on
the
day
of
pentecost
for
peter
had
still
to
learn
at
joppa
that
he
was
to
baptize
cornelius
not
at
joppa
and
c√¶sarea
for
paul
had
to
write
his
epistles
not
on
the
death
of
the
last
apostle
for
ignatius
had
to
establish
the
doctrine
of
episcopacy
not
then
nor
for
centuries
after
for
the
canon
of
the
new
testament
was
still
undetermined
not
in
the
creed
which
is
no
collection
of
definitions
but
a
summary
of
certain
an
incomplete
summary
and
like
the
lord
prayer
or
the
decalogue
a
mere
sample
of
divine
truths
especially
of
the
more
elementary
no
one
doctrine
can
be
named
which
starts
complete
at
first
and
gains
nothing
afterwards
from
the
investigations
of
faith
and
the
attacks
of
heresy
the
church
went
forth
from
the
old
world
in
haste
as
the
israelites
from
egypt
with
their
dough
before
it
was
leavened
their
kneading
troughs
being
bound
up
in
their
clothes
upon
their
shoulders
further
the
political
developments
contained
in
the
historical
parts
of
scripture
are
as
striking
as
the
prophetical
and
the
doctrinal
can
any
history
wear
a
more
human
appearance
than
that
of
the
rise
and
growth
of
the
chosen
people
to
whom
i
have
just
referred
what
had
been
determined
in
the
counsels
of
the
lord
of
heaven
and
earth
from
the
beginning
what
was
immutable
what
was
announced
to
moses
in
the
burning
bush
is
afterwards
represented
as
the
growth
of
an
idea
under
successive
emergencies
the
divine
voice
in
the
bush
had
announced
the
exodus
of
the
children
of
israel
from
egypt
and
their
entrance
into
canaan
and
added
as
a
token
of
the
certainty
of
his
purpose
when
thou
hast
brought
forth
the
people
out
of
egypt
ye
shall
serve
god
upon
this
mountain
now
this
sacrifice
or
festival
which
was
but
incidental
and
secondary
in
the
great
deliverance
is
for
a
while
the
ultimate
scope
of
the
demands
which
moses
makes
upon
pharaoh
thou
shalt
come
thou
and
the
elders
of
israel
unto
the
king
of
egypt
and
ye
shall
say
unto
him
the
lord
god
of
the
hebrews
hath
met
with
us
and
now
let
us
go
we
beseech
thee
three
days
journey
into
the
wilderness
that
we
may
sacrifice
to
the
lord
our
god
it
had
been
added
that
pharaoh
would
first
refuse
their
request
but
that
after
miracles
he
would
let
them
go
altogether
nay
with
jewels
of
silver
and
gold
and
raiment
accordingly
the
first
request
of
moses
was
let
us
go
we
pray
thee
three
days
journey
into
the
desert
and
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
our
god
before
the
plague
of
frogs
the
warning
is
repeated
let
my
people
go
that
they
may
serve
me
and
after
it
pharaoh
says
i
will
let
the
people
go
that
they
may
do
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
it
occurs
again
before
the
plague
of
flies
and
after
it
pharaoh
offers
to
let
the
israelites
sacrifice
in
egypt
which
moses
refuses
on
the
ground
that
they
will
have
to
sacrifice
the
abomination
of
the
egyptians
before
their
eyes
we
will
go
three
days
journey
into
the
wilderness
he
proceeds
and
sacrifice
to
the
lord
our
god
and
pharaoh
then
concedes
their
sacrificing
in
the
wilderness
only
he
says
you
shall
not
go
very
far
away
the
demand
is
repeated
separately
before
the
plagues
of
murrain
hail
and
locusts
no
mention
being
yet
made
of
anything
beyond
a
service
or
sacrifice
in
the
wilderness
on
the
last
of
these
interviews
pharaoh
asks
an
explanation
and
moses
extends
his
claim
we
will
go
with
our
young
and
with
our
old
with
our
sons
and
with
our
daughters
with
our
flocks
and
with
our
herds
will
we
go
for
we
must
hold
a
feast
unto
the
lord
that
it
was
an
extension
seems
plain
from
pharaoh
reply
go
now
ye
that
are
men
and
serve
the
lord
for
that
ye
did
desire
upon
the
plague
of
darkness
pharaoh
concedes
the
extended
demand
excepting
the
flocks
and
herds
but
moses
reminds
him
that
they
were
implied
though
not
expressed
in
the
original
wording
thou
must
give
us
also
sacrifices
and
burnt
offerings
that
we
may
sacrifice
unto
the
lord
our
god
even
to
the
last
there
was
no
intimation
of
their
leaving
egypt
for
good
the
issue
was
left
to
be
wrought
out
by
the
egyptians
all
these
thy
servants
says
moses
shall
come
down
unto
me
and
bow
down
themselves
unto
me
saying
get
thee
out
and
all
the
people
that
follow
thee
and
after
that
i
will
go
out
and
accordingly
after
the
judgment
on
the
they
were
thrust
out
at
midnight
with
their
flocks
and
herds
their
kneading
troughs
and
their
dough
laden
too
with
the
spoils
of
egypt
as
had
been
yet
apparently
by
a
combination
of
circumstances
or
the
complication
of
a
crisis
yet
moses
knew
that
their
departure
from
egypt
was
final
for
he
took
the
bones
of
joseph
with
him
and
that
conviction
broke
on
pharaoh
soon
when
he
and
his
asked
themselves
why
have
we
done
this
that
we
have
let
israel
go
from
serving
us
but
this
progress
of
events
vague
and
uncertain
as
it
seemed
to
be
notwithstanding
the
miracles
which
attended
it
had
been
directed
by
him
who
works
out
gradually
what
he
has
determined
absolutely
and
it
ended
in
the
parting
of
the
red
sea
and
the
destruction
of
pharaoh
host
on
his
pursuing
them
moreover
from
what
occurred
forty
years
afterwards
when
they
were
advancing
upon
the
promised
land
it
would
seem
that
the
original
grant
of
territory
did
not
include
the
country
east
of
jordan
held
in
the
event
by
reuben
gad
and
half
the
tribe
of
manasseh
at
least
they
undertook
at
first
to
leave
sihon
in
undisturbed
possession
of
his
country
if
he
would
let
them
pass
through
it
and
only
on
his
refusing
his
permission
did
they
invade
and
appropriate
it
it
is
in
point
to
notice
also
the
structure
and
style
of
scripture
a
structure
so
unsystematic
and
various
and
a
style
so
figurative
and
indirect
that
no
one
would
presume
at
first
sight
to
say
what
is
in
it
and
what
is
not
it
can
not
as
it
were
be
mapped
or
its
contents
catalogued
but
after
all
our
diligence
to
the
end
of
our
lives
and
to
the
end
of
the
church
it
must
be
an
unexplored
and
unsubdued
land
with
heights
and
valleys
forests
and
streams
on
the
right
and
left
of
our
path
and
close
about
us
full
of
concealed
wonders
and
choice
treasures
of
no
doctrine
whatever
which
does
not
actually
contradict
what
has
been
delivered
can
it
be
peremptorily
asserted
that
it
is
not
in
scripture
of
no
reader
whatever
be
his
study
of
it
can
it
be
said
that
he
has
mastered
every
doctrine
which
it
contains
butler
remarks
on
this
subject
were
just
now
referred
to
the
more
distinct
and
particular
knowledge
he
says
of
those
things
the
study
of
which
the
apostle
calls
on
unto
perfection
that
is
of
the
more
recondite
doctrines
of
the
gospel
and
of
the
prophetic
parts
of
revelation
like
many
parts
of
natural
and
even
civil
knowledge
may
require
very
exact
thought
and
careful
consideration
the
hindrances
too
of
natural
and
of
supernatural
light
and
knowledge
have
been
of
the
same
kind
and
as
it
is
owned
the
whole
scheme
of
scripture
is
not
yet
understood
so
if
it
ever
comes
to
be
understood
before
the
of
all
things
and
without
miraculous
interpositions
it
must
be
in
the
same
way
as
natural
knowledge
is
come
at
by
the
continuance
and
progress
of
learning
and
of
liberty
and
by
particular
persons
attending
to
comparing
and
pursuing
intimations
scattered
up
and
down
it
which
are
overlooked
and
disregarded
by
the
generality
of
the
world
for
this
is
the
way
in
which
all
improvements
are
made
by
thoughtful
men
tracing
on
obscure
hints
as
it
were
dropped
us
by
nature
accidentally
or
which
seem
to
come
into
our
minds
by
chance
nor
is
it
at
all
incredible
that
a
book
which
has
been
so
long
in
the
possession
of
mankind
should
contain
many
truths
as
yet
undiscovered
for
all
the
same
phenomena
and
the
same
faculties
of
investigation
from
which
such
great
discoveries
in
natural
knowledge
have
been
made
in
the
present
and
last
age
were
equally
in
the
possession
of
mankind
several
thousand
years
before
and
possibly
it
might
be
intended
that
events
as
they
come
to
pass
should
open
and
ascertain
the
meaning
of
several
parts
of
scripture
butler
of
course
was
not
contemplating
the
case
of
new
articles
of
faith
or
developments
imperative
on
our
acceptance
but
he
surely
bears
witness
to
the
probability
of
developments
taking
place
in
christian
doctrine
considered
in
themselves
which
is
the
point
at
present
in
question
it
may
be
added
that
in
matter
of
fact
all
the
definitions
or
received
judgments
of
the
early
and
medieval
church
rest
upon
definite
even
though
sometimes
obscure
sentences
of
scripture
thus
purgatory
may
appeal
to
the
saving
by
fire
and
entering
through
much
tribulation
into
the
kingdom
of
god
the
communication
of
the
merits
of
the
saints
to
our
receiving
a
prophet

of

of

so
of
the
rest
lastly
while
scripture
nowhere
recognizes
itself
or
asserts
the
inspiration
of
those
passages
which
are
most
essential
it
distinctly
anticipates
the
development
of
christianity
both
as
a
polity
and
as
a
doctrine
in
one
of
our
lord
parables
the
kingdom
of
heaven
is
even
compared
to
a
grain
of
which
a
man
took
and
hid
in
his
field
which
indeed
is
the
least
of
all
seeds
but
when
it
is
grown
it
is
the
greatest
among
herbs
and
becometh
a
tree
and
as
mark
words
it
shooteth
out
great
branches
so
that
the
birds
of
the
air
come
and
lodge
in
the
branches
thereof
and
again
in
the
same
chapter
of
mark
so
is
the
kingdom
of
god
as
if
a
man
should
cast
seed
into
the
ground
and
should
sleep
and
rise
night
and
day
and
the
seed
should
spring
and
grow
up
he
knoweth
not
how
for
the
earth
bringeth
forth
fruit
of
herself
here
an
internal
element
of
life
whether
principle
or
doctrine
is
spoken
of
rather
than
any
mere
external
manifestation
and
it
is
observable
that
the
spontaneous
as
well
as
the
gradual
character
of
the
growth
is
intimated
this
description
of
the
process
corresponds
to
what
has
been
above
observed
respecting
development
viz
that
it
is
not
an
effect
of
wishing
and
resolving
or
of
forced
enthusiasm
or
of
any
mechanism
of
reasoning
or
of
any
mere
subtlety
of
intellect
but
comes
of
its
own
innate
power
of
expansion
within
the
mind
in
its
season
though
with
the
use
of
reflection
and
argument
and
original
thought
more
or
less
as
it
may
happen
with
a
dependence
on
the
ethical
growth
of
the
mind
itself
and
with
a
reflex
influence
upon
it
again
the
parable
of
the
leaven
describes
the
development
of
doctrine
in
another
respect
in
its
active
engrossing
and
interpenetrating
power
from
the
necessity
then
of
the
case
from
the
history
of
all
sects
and
parties
in
religion
and
from
the
analogy
and
example
of
scripture
we
may
fairly
conclude
that
christian
doctrine
admits
of
formal
legitimate
and
true
developments
that
is
of
developments
contemplated
by
its
divine
author
the
general
analogy
of
the
world
physical
and
moral
confirms
this
conclusion
as
we
are
reminded
by
the
great
authority
who
has
already
been
quoted
in
the
course
of
this
section
the
whole
natural
world
and
government
of
it
says
butler
is
a
scheme
or
system
not
a
fixed
but
a
progressive
one
a
scheme
in
which
the
operation
of
various
means
takes
up
a
great
length
of
time
before
the
ends
they
tend
to
can
be
attained
the
change
of
seasons
the
ripening
of
the
fruits
of
the
earth
the
very
history
of
a
flower
is
an
instance
of
this
and
so
is
human
life
thus
vegetable
bodies
and
those
of
animals
though
possibly
formed
at
once
yet
grow
up
by
degrees
to
a
mature
state
and
thus
rational
agents
who
animate
these
latter
bodies
are
naturally
directed
to
form
each
his
own
manners
and
character
by
the
gradual
gaining
of
knowledge
and
experience
and
by
a
long
course
of
action
our
existence
is
not
only
successive
as
it
must
be
of
necessity
but
one
state
of
our
life
and
being
is
appointed
by
god
to
be
a
preparation
for
another
and
that
to
be
the
means
of
attaining
to
another
succeeding
one
infancy
to
childhood
childhood
to
youth
youth
to
mature
age
men
are
impatient
and
for
precipitating
things
but
the
author
of
nature
appears
deliberate
throughout
his
operations
accomplishing
his
natural
ends
by
slow
successive
steps
and
there
is
a
plan
of
things
beforehand
laid
out
which
from
the
nature
of
it
requires
various
systems
of
means
as
well
as
length
of
time
in
order
to
the
carrying
on
its
several
parts
into
execution
thus
in
the
daily
course
of
natural
providence
god
operates
in
the
very
same
manner
as
in
the
dispensation
of
christianity
making
one
thing
subservient
to
another
this
to
somewhat
farther
and
so
on
through
a
progressive
series
of
means
which
extend
both
backward
and
forward
beyond
our
utmost
view
of
this
manner
of
operation
everything
we
see
in
the
course
of
nature
is
as
much
an
instance
as
any
part
of
the
christian
dispensation
section
ii
an
infallible
developing
authority
to
be
expected
it
has
now
been
made
probable
that
developments
of
christianity
were
but
natural
as
time
went
on
and
were
to
be
expected
and
that
these
natural
and
true
developments
as
being
natural
and
true
were
of
course
contemplated
and
taken
into
account
by
its
author
who
in
designing
the
work
designed
its
legitimate
results
these
whatever
they
turn
out
to
be
may
be
called
absolutely
the
developments
of
christianity
that
beyond
reasonable
doubt
there
are
such
is
surely
a
great
step
gained
in
the
inquiry
it
is
a
momentous
fact
the
next
question
is
are
they
and
to
a
theologian
who
could
take
a
general
view
and
also
possessed
an
intimate
and
minute
knowledge
of
its
history
they
would
doubtless
on
the
whole
be
easily
distinguishable
by
their
own
characters
and
require
no
foreign
aid
to
point
them
out
no
external
authority
to
ratify
them
but
it
is
difficult
to
say
who
is
exactly
in
this
position
considering
that
christians
from
the
nature
of
the
case
live
under
the
bias
of
the
doctrines
and
in
the
very
midst
of
the
facts
and
during
the
process
of
the
controversies
which
are
to
be
the
subject
of
criticism
since
they
are
exposed
to
the
prejudices
of
birth
education
place
personal
attachment
engagements
and
party
it
can
hardly
be
maintained
that
in
matter
of
fact
a
true
development
carries
with
it
always
its
own
certainty
even
to
the
learned
or
that
history
past
or
present
is
secure
from
the
possibility
of
a
variety
of
interpretations
i
have
already
spoken
on
this
subject
and
from
a
very
different
point
of
view
from
that
which
i
am
taking
at
present
prophets
or
doctors
are
the
interpreters
of
the
revelation
they
unfold
and
define
its
mysteries
they
illuminate
its
documents
they
harmonize
its
contents
they
apply
its
promises
their
teaching
is
a
vast
system
not
to
be
comprised
in
a
few
sentences
not
to
be
embodied
in
one
code
or
treatise
but
consisting
of
a
certain
body
of
truth
pervading
the
church
like
an
atmosphere
irregular
in
its
shape
from
its
very
profusion
and
exuberance
at
times
separable
only
in
idea
from
episcopal
tradition
yet
at
times
melting
away
into
legend
and
fable
partly
written
partly
unwritten
partly
the
interpretation
partly
the
supplement
of
scripture
partly
preserved
in
intellectual
expressions
partly
latent
in
the
spirit
and
temper
of
christians
poured
to
and
fro
in
closets
and
upon
the
housetops
in
liturgies
in
controversial
works
in
obscure
fragments
in
sermons
in
popular
prejudices
in
local
customs
this
i
call
prophetical
tradition
existing
primarily
in
the
bosom
of
the
church
itself
and
recorded
in
such
measure
as
providence
has
determined
in
the
writings
of
eminent
men
keep
that
which
is
committed
to
thy
charge
is
paul
injunction
to
timothy
and
for
this
reason
because
from
its
vastness
and
indefiniteness
it
is
especially
exposed
to
corruption
if
the
church
fails
in
vigilance
this
is
that
body
of
teaching
which
is
offered
to
all
christians
even
at
the
present
day
though
in
various
forms
and
measures
of
truth
in
different
parts
of
christendom
partly
being
a
comment
partly
an
addition
upon
the
articles
of
the
creed
if
this
be
true
certainly
some
rule
is
necessary
for
arranging
and
authenticating
these
various
expressions
and
results
of
christian
doctrine
no
one
will
maintain
that
all
points
of
belief
are
of
equal
importance
there
are
what
may
be
called
minor
points
which
we
may
hold
to
be
true
without
imposing
them
as
necessary
there
are
greater
truths
and
lesser
truths
points
which
it
is
necessary
and
points
which
it
is
pious
to
believe
the
simple
question
is
how
are
we
to
discriminate
the
greater
from
the
less
the
true
from
the
false
this
need
of
an
authoritative
sanction
is
increased
by
considering
after
guizot
suggestion
that
christianity
though
represented
in
prophecy
as
a
kingdom
came
into
the
world
as
an
idea
rather
than
an
institution
and
has
had
to
wrap
itself
in
clothing
and
fit
itself
with
armour
of
its
own
providing
and
to
form
the
instruments
and
methods
of
its
prosperity
and
warfare
if
the
developments
which
have
above
been
called
are
to
take
place
to
any
great
extent
and
without
them
it
is
difficult
to
see
how
christianity
can
exist
at
all
if
only
its
relations
towards
civil
government
have
to
be
ascertained
or
the
qualifications
for
the
profession
of
it
have
to
be
defined
surely
an
authority
is
necessary
to
impart
decision
to
what
is
vague
and
confidence
to
what
is
empirical
to
ratify
the
successive
steps
of
so
elaborate
a
process
and
to
secure
the
validity
of
inferences
which
are
to
be
made
the
premisses
of
more
remote
investigations
tests
it
is
true
for
ascertaining
the
correctness
of
developments
in
general
may
be
drawn
out
as
i
shall
show
in
the
sequel
but
they
are
insufficient
for
the
guidance
of
individuals
in
the
case
of
so
large
and
complicated
a
problem
as
christianity
though
they
may
aid
our
inquiries
and
support
our
conclusions
in
particular
points
they
are
of
a
scientific
and
controversial
not
of
a
practical
character
and
are
instruments
rather
than
warrants
of
right
decisions
moreover
they
rather
serve
as
answers
to
objections
brought
against
the
actual
decisions
of
authority
than
are
proofs
of
the
correctness
of
those
decisions
while
then
on
the
one
hand
it
is
probable
that
some
means
will
be
granted
for
ascertaining
the
legitimate
and
true
developments
of
revelation
it
appears
on
the
other
that
these
means
must
of
necessity
be
external
to
the
developments
themselves
reasons
shall
be
given
in
this
section
for
concluding
that
in
proportion
to
the
probability
of
true
developments
of
doctrine
and
practice
in
the
divine
scheme
so
is
the
probability
also
of
the
appointment
in
that
scheme
of
an
external
authority
to
decide
upon
them
thereby
separating
them
from
the
mass
of
mere
human
speculation
extravagance
corruption
and
error
in
and
out
of
which
they
grow
this
is
the
doctrine
of
the
infallibility
of
the
church
for
by
infallibility
i
suppose
is
meant
the
power
of
deciding
whether
this
that
and
a
third
and
any
number
of
theological
or
ethical
statements
are
true
let
the
state
of
the
case
be
carefully
considered
if
the
christian
doctrine
as
originally
taught
admits
of
true
and
important
developments
as
was
argued
in
the
foregoing
section
this
is
a
strong
antecedent
argument
in
favour
of
a
provision
in
the
dispensation
for
putting
a
seal
of
authority
upon
those
developments
the
probability
of
their
being
known
to
be
true
varies
with
that
of
their
truth
the
two
ideas
indeed
are
quite
distinct
i
grant
of
revealing
and
of
guaranteeing
a
truth
and
they
are
often
distinct
in
fact
there
are
various
revelations
all
over
the
earth
which
do
not
carry
with
them
the
evidence
of
their
divinity
such
are
the
inward
suggestions
and
secret
illuminations
granted
to
so
many
individuals
such
are
the
traditionary
doctrines
which
are
found
among
the
heathen
that
vague
and
unconnected
family
of
religious
truths
originally
from
god
but
sojourning
without
the
sanction
of
miracle
or
a
definite
home
as
pilgrims
up
and
down
the
world
and
discernible
and
separable
from
the
corrupt
legends
with
which
they
are
mixed
by
the
spiritual
mind
alone
there
is
nothing
impossible
in
the
notion
of
a
revelation
occurring
without
evidences
that
it
is
a
revelation
just
as
human
sciences
are
a
divine
gift
yet
are
reached
by
our
ordinary
powers
and
have
no
claim
on
our
faith
but
christianity
is
not
of
this
nature
it
is
a
revelation
which
comes
to
us
as
a
revelation
as
a
whole
objectively
and
with
a
profession
of
infallibility
and
the
only
question
to
be
determined
relates
to
the
matter
of
the
revelation
if
then
there
are
certain
great
truths
or
duties
or
observances
naturally
and
legitimately
resulting
from
the
doctrines
originally
professed
it
is
but
reasonable
to
include
these
true
results
in
the
idea
of
the
revelation
itself
to
consider
them
parts
of
it
and
if
the
revelation
be
not
only
true
but
guaranteed
as
true
to
anticipate
that
they
too
will
come
under
the
privilege
of
that
guarantee
christianity
unlike
other
revelations
of
god
will
except
the
jewish
of
which
it
is
a
continuation
is
an
objective
religion
or
a
revelation
with
credentials
it
is
natural
i
say
to
view
it
wholly
as
such
and
not
partly
partly
like
others
such
as
it
begins
such
let
it
be
considered
to
continue
granting
that
certain
large
developments
of
it
are
true
they
must
surely
be
accredited
as
true
an
objection
however
is
often
made
to
the
doctrine
of
infallibility
which
is
too
important
not
to
be
taken
into
consideration
it
is
urged
that
as
all
religious
knowledge
rests
on
moral
evidence
not
on
demonstration
our
belief
in
the
church
infallibility
must
be
of
this
character
but
what
can
be
more
absurd
than
a
probable
infallibility
or
a
certainty
resting
on
doubt
i
believe
because
i
am
sure
and
i
am
sure
because
i
suppose
granting
then
that
the
gift
of
infallibility
be
adapted
when
believed
to
unite
all
intellects
in
one
common
confession
the
fact
that
it
is
given
is
as
difficult
of
proof
as
the
developments
which
it
is
to
prove
and
nugatory
therefore
and
in
consequence
improbable
in
a
divine
scheme
the
advocates
of
rome
it
has
been
urged
insist
on
the
necessity
of
an
infallible
guide
in
religious
matters
as
an
argument
that
such
a
guide
has
really
been
accorded
now
it
is
obvious
to
inquire
how
individuals
are
to
know
with
certainty
that
rome
infallible
how
any
ground
can
be
such
as
to
bring
home
to
the
mind
infallibly
that
she
is
infallible
what
conceivable
proof
amounts
to
more
than
a
probability
of
the
fact
and
what
advantage
is
an
infallible
guide
if
those
who
are
to
be
guided
have
after
all
no
more
than
an
opinion
as
the
romanists
call
it
that
she
is
infallible
this
argument
however
except
when
used
as
is
intended
in
this
passage
against
such
persons
as
would
remove
all
imperfection
in
the
proof
of
religion
is
certainly
a
fallacious
one
for
since
as
all
allow
the
apostles
were
infallible
it
tells
against
their
infallibility
or
the
infallibility
of
scripture
as
truly
as
against
the
infallibility
of
the
church
for
no
one
will
say
that
the
apostles
were
made
infallible
for
nothing
yet
we
are
only
morally
certain
that
they
were
infallible
further
if
we
have
but
probable
grounds
for
the
church
infallibility
we
have
but
the
like
for
the
impossibility
of
certain
things
the
necessity
of
others
the
truth
the
certainty
of
others
and
therefore
the
words
and
ought
all
of
them
to
be
banished
from
the
language
but
why
is
it
more
inconsistent
to
speak
of
an
uncertain
infallibility
than
of
a
doubtful
truth
or
a
contingent
necessity
phrases
which
present
ideas
clear
and
undeniable
in
sooth
we
are
playing
with
words
when
we
use
arguments
of
this
sort
when
we
say
that
a
person
is
infallible
we
mean
no
more
than
that
what
he
says
is
always
true
always
to
be
believed
always
to
be
done
the
term
is
resolvable
into
these
phrases
as
its
equivalents
either
then
the
phrases
are
inadmissible
or
the
idea
of
infallibility
must
be
allowed
a
probable
infallibility
is
a
probable
gift
of
never
erring
a
reception
of
the
doctrine
of
a
probable
infallibility
is
faith
and
obedience
towards
a
person
founded
on
the
probability
of
his
never
erring
in
his
declarations
or
commands
what
is
inconsistent
in
this
idea
whatever
then
be
the
particular
means
of
determining
infallibility
the
abstract
objection
may
be
put
aside
again
it
is
sometimes
argued
that
such
a
dispensation
would
destroy
our
probation
as
dissipating
doubt
precluding
the
exercise
of
faith
and
obliging
us
to
obey
whether
we
wish
it
or
no
and
it
is
urged
that
a
divine
voice
spoke
in
the
first
age
and
difficulty
and
darkness
rest
upon
all
subsequent
ones
as
if
infallibility
and
personal
judgment
were
incompatible
but
this
is
to
confuse
the
subject
we
must
distinguish
between
a
revelation
and
a
reception
of
it
not
between
its
earlier
and
later
stages
a
revelation
in
itself
divine
and
guaranteed
as
such
may
from
first
to
last
be
received
doubted
argued
against
perverted
rejected
by
individuals
according
to
the
state
of
mind
of
each
ignorance
misapprehension
unbelief
and
other
causes
do
not
at
once
cease
to
operate
because
the
revelation
is
in
itself
true
and
in
its
proofs
irrefragable
we
have
then
no
warrant
at
all
for
saying
that
an
accredited
revelation
will
exclude
the
existence
of
doubts
and
difficulties
on
the
part
of
those
whom
it
addresses
or
dispense
with
anxious
diligence
on
their
part
though
it
may
in
its
own
nature
tend
to
do
so
infallibility
does
not
interfere
with
moral
probation
the
two
notions
are
absolutely
distinct
it
is
no
objection
then
to
the
idea
of
a
peremptory
authority
such
as
i
am
supposing
that
it
lessens
the
task
of
personal
inquiry
unless
it
be
an
objection
to
the
authority
of
revelation
altogether
a
church
or
a
council
or
a
pope
or
a
consent
of
doctors
or
a
consent
of
christendom
limits
the
inquiries
of
the
individual
in
no
other
way
than
scripture
limits
them
it
does
limit
them
but
while
it
limits
their
range
it
preserves
intact
their
probationary
character
we
are
tried
as
really
though
not
on
so
large
a
field
to
suppose
that
the
doctrine
of
a
permanent
authority
in
matters
of
faith
interferes
with
our
and
responsibility
is
as
before
to
forget
that
there
were
infallible
teachers
in
the
first
age
and
heretics
and
schismatics
in
the
ages
subsequent
there
may
have
been
at
once
a
supreme
authority
from
first
to
last
and
a
moral
judgment
from
first
to
last
moreover
those
who
maintain
that
christian
truth
must
be
gained
solely
by
personal
efforts
are
bound
to
show
that
methods
ethical
and
intellectual
are
granted
to
individuals
sufficient
for
gaining
it
else
the
mode
of
probation
they
advocate
is
less
not
more
perfect
than
that
which
proceeds
upon
external
authority
on
the
whole
then
no
argument
against
continuing
the
principle
of
objectiveness
into
the
developments
of
revelation
arises
out
of
the
conditions
of
our
moral
responsibility
perhaps
it
will
be
urged
that
the
analogy
of
nature
is
against
our
anticipating
the
continuance
of
an
external
authority
which
has
once
been
given
because
in
the
words
of
the
profound
thinker
who
has
already
been
cited
we
are
wholly
ignorant
what
degree
of
new
knowledge
it
were
to
be
expected
god
would
give
mankind
by
revelation
upon
supposition
of
his
affording
one
or
how
far
and
in
what
way
he
would
interpose
miraculously
to
qualify
them
to
whom
he
should
originally
make
the
revelation
for
communicating
the
knowledge
given
by
it
and
to
secure
their
doing
it
to
the
age
in
which
they
should
live
and
to
secure
its
being
transmitted
to
posterity
and
because
we
are
not
in
any
sort
able
to
judge
whether
it
were
to
be
expected
that
the
revelation
should
have
been
committed
to
writing
or
left
to
be
handed
down
and
consequently
corrupted
by
verbal
tradition
and
at
length
sunk
under
it
but
this
reasoning
does
not
apply
here
as
has
already
been
observed
it
contemplates
only
the
abstract
hypothesis
of
a
revelation
not
the
fact
of
an
existing
revelation
of
a
particular
kind
which
may
of
course
in
various
ways
modify
our
state
of
knowledge
by
settling
some
of
those
very
points
which
before
it
was
given
we
had
no
means
of
deciding
nor
can
it
as
i
think
be
fairly
denied
that
the
argument
from
analogy
in
one
point
of
view
tells
against
anticipating
a
revelation
at
all
for
an
innovation
upon
the
physical
order
of
the
world
is
by
the
very
force
of
the
terms
inconsistent
with
its
ordinary
course
we
can
not
then
regulate
our
antecedent
view
of
the
character
of
a
revelation
by
a
test
which
applied
simply
overthrows
the
very
notion
of
a
revelation
altogether
any
how
analogy
is
in
some
sort
violated
by
the
fact
of
a
revelation
and
the
question
before
us
only
relates
to
the
extent
of
that
violation
i
will
hazard
a
distinction
here
between
the
facts
of
revelation
and
its
principles
the
argument
from
analogy
is
more
concerned
with
its
principles
than
with
its
facts
the
revealed
facts
are
special
and
singular
not
analogous
from
the
nature
of
the
case
but
it
is
otherwise
with
the
revealed
principles
these
are
common
to
all
the
works
of
god
and
if
the
author
of
nature
be
the
author
of
grace
it
may
be
expected
that
while
the
two
systems
of
facts
are
distinct
and
independent
the
principles
displayed
in
them
will
be
the
same
and
form
a
connecting
link
between
them
in
this
identity
of
principle
lies
the
analogy
of
natural
and
revealed
religion
in
butler
sense
of
the
word
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
is
a
fact
and
can
not
be
paralleled
by
anything
in
nature
the
doctrine
of
mediation
is
a
principle
and
is
abundantly
exemplified
in
its
provisions
miracles
are
facts
inspiration
is
a
fact
divine
teaching
once
for
all
and
a
continual
teaching
are
each
a
fact
probation
by
means
of
intellectual
difficulties
is
a
principle
both
in
nature
and
in
grace
and
may
be
carried
on
in
the
system
of
grace
either
by
a
standing
ordinance
of
teaching
or
by
one
definite
act
of
teaching
and
that
with
an
analogy
equally
perfect
in
either
case
to
the
order
of
nature
nor
can
we
succeed
in
arguing
from
the
analogy
of
that
order
against
a
standing
guardianship
of
revelation
without
arguing
also
against
its
original
bestowal
supposing
the
order
of
nature
once
broken
by
the
introduction
of
a
revelation
the
continuance
of
that
revelation
is
but
a
question
of
degree
and
the
circumstance
that
a
work
has
begun
makes
it
more
probable
than
not
that
it
will
proceed
we
have
no
reason
to
suppose
that
there
is
so
great
a
distinction
of
dispensation
between
ourselves
and
the
first
generation
of
christians
as
that
they
had
a
living
infallible
guidance
and
we
have
not
the
case
then
stands
thus
revelation
has
introduced
a
new
law
of
divine
governance
over
and
above
those
laws
which
appear
in
the
natural
course
of
the
world
and
in
consequence
we
are
able
to
argue
for
the
existence
of
a
standing
authority
in
matters
of
faith
on
the
analogy
of
nature
and
from
the
fact
of
christianity
preservation
is
involved
in
the
idea
of
creation
as
the
creator
rested
on
the
seventh
day
from
the
work
which
he
had
made
yet
he
worketh
hitherto
so
he
gave
the
creed
once
for
all
in
the
beginning
yet
blesses
its
growth
still
and
provides
for
its
increase
his
word
shall
not
return
unto
him
void
but
accomplish
his
pleasure
as
creation
argues
continual
governance
so
are
apostles
harbingers
of
popes
moreover
it
must
be
borne
in
mind
that
as
the
essence
of
all
religion
is
authority
and
obedience
so
the
distinction
between
natural
religion
and
revealed
lies
in
this
that
the
one
has
a
subjective
authority
and
the
other
an
objective
revelation
consists
in
the
manifestation
of
the
invisible
divine
power
or
in
the
substitution
of
the
voice
of
a
lawgiver
for
the
voice
of
conscience
the
supremacy
of
conscience
is
the
essence
of
natural
religion
the
supremacy
of
apostle
or
pope
or
church
or
bishop
is
the
essence
of
revealed
and
when
such
external
authority
is
taken
away
the
mind
falls
back
again
of
necessity
upon
that
inward
guide
which
it
possessed
even
before
revelation
was
vouchsafed
thus
what
conscience
is
in
the
system
of
nature
such
is
the
voice
of
scripture
or
of
the
church
or
of
the
holy
see
as
we
may
determine
it
in
the
system
of
revelation
it
may
be
objected
indeed
that
conscience
is
not
infallible
it
is
true
but
still
it
is
ever
to
be
obeyed
and
this
is
just
the
prerogative
which
controversialists
assign
to
the
see
of
peter
it
is
not
in
all
cases
infallible
it
may
err
beyond
its
special
province
but
it
has
in
all
cases
a
claim
on
our
obedience
all
catholics
and
heretics
says
bellarmine
agree
in
two
things
first
that
it
is
possible
for
the
pope
even
as
pope
and
with
his
own
assembly
of
councillors
or
with
general
council
to
err
in
particular
controversies
of
fact
which
chiefly
depend
on
human
information
and
testimony
secondly
that
it
is
possible
for
him
to
err
as
a
private
doctor
even
in
universal
questions
of
right
whether
of
faith
or
of
morals
and
that
from
ignorance
as
sometimes
happens
to
other
doctors
next
all
catholics
agree
in
other
two
points
not
however
with
heretics
but
solely
with
each
other
first
that
the
pope
with
general
council
can
not
err
either
in
framing
decrees
of
faith
or
general
precepts
of
morality
secondly
that
the
pope
when
determining
anything
in
a
doubtful
matter
whether
by
himself
or
with
his
own
particular
council
it
is
possible
for
him
to
err
or
not
is
to
be
by
all
the
faithful
and
as
obedience
to
conscience
even
supposing
conscience
tends
to
the
improvement
of
our
moral
nature
and
ultimately
of
our
knowledge
so
obedience
to
our
ecclesiastical
superior
may
subserve
our
growth
in
illumination
and
sanctity
even
though
he
should
command
what
is
extreme
or
inexpedient
or
teach
what
is
external
to
his
legitimate
province
the
common
sense
of
mankind
does
but
support
a
conclusion
thus
forced
upon
us
by
analogical
considerations
it
feels
that
the
very
idea
of
revelation
implies
a
present
informant
and
guide
and
that
an
infallible
one
not
a
mere
abstract
declaration
of
truths
unknown
before
to
man
or
a
record
of
history
or
the
result
of
an
antiquarian
research
but
a
message
and
a
lesson
speaking
to
this
man
and
that
this
is
shown
by
the
popular
notion
which
has
prevailed
among
us
since
the
reformation
that
the
bible
itself
is
such
a
guide
and
which
succeeded
in
overthrowing
the
supremacy
of
church
and
pope
for
the
very
reason
that
it
was
a
rival
authority
not
resisting
merely
but
supplanting
it
in
proportion
then
as
we
find
in
matter
of
fact
that
the
inspired
volume
is
not
adapted
or
intended
to
subserve
that
purpose
are
we
forced
to
revert
to
that
living
and
present
guide
who
at
the
era
of
our
rejection
of
her
had
been
so
long
recognized
as
the
dispenser
of
scripture
according
to
times
and
circumstances
and
the
arbiter
of
all
true
doctrine
and
holy
practice
to
her
children
we
feel
a
need
and
she
alone
of
all
things
under
heaven
supplies
it
we
are
told
that
god
has
spoken
where
in
a
book
we
have
tried
it
and
it
disappoints
it
disappoints
us
that
most
holy
and
blessed
gift
not
from
fault
of
its
own
but
because
it
is
used
for
a
purpose
for
which
it
was
not
given
the
ethiopian
reply
when
philip
asked
him
if
he
understood
what
he
was
reading
is
the
voice
of
nature
how
can
i
unless
some
man
shall
guide
me
the
church
undertakes
that
office
she
does
what
none
else
can
do
and
this
is
the
secret
of
her
power
the
human
mind
it
has
been
said
wishes
to
be
rid
of
doubt
in
religion
and
a
teacher
who
claims
infallibility
is
readily
believed
on
his
simple
word
we
see
this
constantly
exemplified
in
the
case
of
individual
pretenders
among
ourselves
in
romanism
the
church
pretends
to
it
she
rids
herself
of
competitors
by
forestalling
them
and
probably
in
the
eyes
of
her
children
this
is
not
the
least
persuasive
argument
for
her
infallibility
that
she
alone
of
all
churches
dares
claim
it
as
if
a
secret
instinct
and
involuntary
misgivings
restrained
those
rival
communions
which
go
so
far
towards
affecting
it
these
sentences
whatever
be
the
errors
of
their
wording
surely
express
a
great
truth
the
most
obvious
answer
then
to
the
question
why
we
yield
to
the
authority
of
the
church
in
the
questions
and
developments
of
faith
is
that
some
authority
there
must
be
if
there
is
a
revelation
given
and
other
authority
there
is
none
but
she
a
revelation
is
not
given
if
there
be
no
authority
to
decide
what
it
is
that
is
given
in
the
words
of
peter
to
her
divine
master
and
lord
to
whom
shall
we
go
nor
must
it
be
forgotten
in
confirmation
that
scripture
expressly
calls
the
church
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
truth
and
promises
her
as
by
covenant
that
the
spirit
of
the
lord
that
is
upon
her
and
his
words
which
he
has
put
in
her
mouth
shall
not
depart
out
of
her
mouth
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
her
seed
nor
out
of
the
mouth
of
her
seed
seed
from
henceforth
and
for
ever
and
if
the
very
claim
to
infallible
arbitration
in
religious
disputes
is
of
so
weighty
importance
and
interest
in
all
ages
of
the
world
much
more
is
it
welcome
at
a
time
like
the
present
when
the
human
intellect
is
so
busy
and
thought
so
fertile
and
opinion
so
manifold
the
absolute
need
of
a
spiritual
supremacy
is
at
present
the
strongest
of
arguments
in
favour
of
the
fact
of
its
supply
surely
either
an
objective
revelation
has
not
been
given
or
it
has
been
provided
with
means
for
impressing
its
objectiveness
on
the
world
if
christianity
be
a
social
religion
as
it
certainly
is
and
if
it
be
based
on
certain
ideas
acknowledged
as
divine
or
a
creed
which
shall
here
be
assumed
and
if
these
ideas
have
various
aspects
and
make
distinct
impressions
on
different
minds
and
issue
in
consequence
in
a
multiplicity
of
developments
true
or
false
or
mixed
as
has
been
shown
what
power
will
suffice
to
meet
and
to
do
justice
to
these
conflicting
conditions
but
a
supreme
authority
ruling
and
reconciling
individual
judgments
by
a
divine
right
and
a
recognized
wisdom
in
barbarous
times
the
will
is
reached
through
the
senses
but
in
an
age
in
which
reason
as
it
is
called
is
the
standard
of
truth
and
right
it
is
abundantly
evident
to
any
one
who
mixes
ever
so
little
with
the
world
that
if
things
are
left
to
themselves
every
individual
will
have
his
own
view
of
them
and
take
his
own
course
that
two
or
three
will
agree
to
part
company
that
scripture
will
be
read
in
contrary
ways
and
history
according
to
the
apologue
will
have
to
different
comers
its
silver
shield
and
its
golden
that
philosophy
taste
prejudice
passion
party
caprice
will
find
no
common
measure
unless
there
be
some
supreme
power
to
control
the
mind
and
to
compel
agreement
there
can
be
no
combination
on
the
basis
of
truth
without
an
organ
of
truth
as
cultivation
brings
out
the
colours
of
flowers
and
domestication
changes
the
character
of
animals
so
does
education
of
necessity
develope
differences
of
opinion
and
while
it
is
impossible
to
lay
down
first
principles
in
which
all
will
unite
it
is
utterly
unreasonable
to
expect
that
this
man
should
yield
to
that
or
all
to
one
i
do
not
say
there
are
no
eternal
truths
such
as
the
poet
proclaims
which
all
acknowledge
in
private
but
that
there
are
none
sufficiently
commanding
to
be
the
basis
of
public
union
and
action
the
only
general
persuasive
in
matters
of
conduct
is
authority
that
is
when
truth
is
in
question
a
judgment
which
we
feel
to
be
superior
to
our
own
if
christianity
is
both
social
and
dogmatic
and
intended
for
all
ages
it
must
humanly
speaking
have
an
infallible
expounder
else
you
will
secure
unity
of
form
at
the
loss
of
unity
of
doctrine
or
unity
of
doctrine
at
the
loss
of
unity
of
form
you
will
have
to
choose
between
a
comprehension
of
opinions
and
a
resolution
into
parties
between
latitudinarian
and
sectarian
error
you
may
be
tolerant
or
intolerant
of
contrarieties
of
thought
but
contrarieties
you
will
have
by
the
church
of
england
a
hollow
uniformity
is
preferred
to
an
infallible
chair
and
by
the
sects
of
england
an
interminable
division
germany
and
geneva
began
with
persecution
and
have
ended
in
scepticism
the
doctrine
of
infallibility
is
a
less
violent
hypothesis
than
this
sacrifice
either
of
faith
or
of
charity
it
secures
the
object
while
it
gives
definiteness
and
force
to
the
matter
of
the
revelation
i
have
called
the
doctrine
of
infallibility
an
hypothesis
let
it
be
so
considered
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
is
let
it
be
considered
to
be
a
mere
position
supported
by
no
direct
evidence
but
required
by
the
facts
of
the
case
and
reconciling
them
with
each
other
that
hypothesis
is
indeed
in
matter
of
fact
maintained
and
acted
on
in
the
largest
portion
of
christendom
and
from
time
immemorial
but
let
this
coincidence
be
accounted
for
by
the
need
moreover
it
is
not
a
naked
or
isolated
fact
but
the
animating
principle
of
a
large
scheme
of
doctrine
which
the
need
itself
could
not
simply
create
but
again
let
this
system
be
merely
called
its
development
yet
even
as
an
hypothesis
which
has
been
held
by
one
out
of
various
communions
it
may
not
be
lightly
put
aside
some
hypothesis
this
or
that
all
parties
all
controversialists
all
historians
must
adopt
if
they
would
treat
of
christianity
at
all
gieseler
text
book
bears
the
profession
of
being
a
dry
analysis
of
christian
history
yet
on
inspection
it
will
be
found
to
be
written
on
a
positive
and
definite
theory
and
to
bend
facts
to
meet
it
an
unbeliever
as
gibbon
assumes
one
hypothesis
and
an
as
baronius
adopts
another
the
school
of
hurd
and
newton
hold
as
the
only
true
view
of
history
that
christianity
slept
for
centuries
upon
centuries
except
among
those
whom
historians
call
heretics
others
speak
as
if
the
oath
of
supremacy
or
the
could
be
made
the
measure
of
ambrose
and
they
fit
the
articles
on
the
fervid
tertullian
the
question
is
which
of
all
these
theories
is
the
simplest
the
most
natural
the
most
persuasive
certainly
the
notion
of
development
under
infallible
authority
is
not
a
less
grave
a
less
winning
hypothesis
than
the
chance
and
coincidence
of
events
or
the
oriental
philosophy
or
the
working
of
antichrist
to
account
for
the
rise
of
christianity
and
the
formation
of
its
theology
section
iii
the
existing
developments
of
doctrine
the
probable
fulfilment
of
that
expectation
i
have
been
arguing
in
respect
to
the
revealed
doctrine
given
to
us
from
above
in
christianity
first
that
in
consequence
of
its
intellectual
character
and
as
passing
through
the
minds
of
so
many
generations
of
men
and
as
applied
by
them
to
so
many
purposes
and
as
investigated
so
curiously
as
to
its
capabilities
implications
and
bearings
it
could
not
but
grow
or
develope
as
time
went
on
into
a
large
theological
system
next
that
if
development
must
be
then
whereas
revelation
is
a
heavenly
gift
he
who
gave
it
virtually
has
not
given
it
unless
he
has
also
secured
it
from
perversion
and
corruption
in
all
such
development
as
comes
upon
it
by
the
necessity
of
its
nature
or
in
other
words
that
that
intellectual
action
through
successive
generations
which
is
the
organ
of
development
must
so
far
forth
as
it
can
claim
to
have
been
put
in
charge
of
the
revelation
be
in
its
determinations
infallible
passing
from
these
two
points
i
come
next
to
the
question
whether
in
the
history
of
christianity
there
is
any
fulfilment
of
such
anticipation
as
i
have
insisted
on
whether
in
doctrines
rites
and
usages
have
grown
up
round
the
apostolic
creed
and
have
interpenetrated
its
articles
claiming
to
be
part
of
christianity
and
looking
like
those
additions
which
we
are
in
search
of
the
answer
is
that
such
additions
there
are
and
that
they
are
found
just
where
they
might
be
expected
in
the
authoritative
seats
and
homes
of
old
tradition
the
latin
and
greek
churches
let
me
enlarge
on
this
point
i
observe
then
that
if
the
idea
of
christianity
as
originally
given
to
us
from
heaven
can
not
but
contain
much
which
will
be
only
partially
recognized
by
us
as
included
in
it
and
only
held
by
us
unconsciously
and
if
again
christianity
being
from
heaven
all
that
is
necessarily
involved
in
it
and
is
evolved
from
it
is
from
heaven
and
if
on
the
other
hand
large
accretions
actually
do
exist
professing
to
be
its
true
and
legitimate
results
our
first
impression
naturally
is
that
these
must
be
the
very
developments
which
they
profess
to
be
moreover
the
very
scale
on
which
they
have
been
made
their
high
antiquity
yet
present
promise
their
gradual
formation
yet
precision
their
harmonious
order
dispose
the
imagination
most
forcibly
towards
the
belief
that
a
teaching
so
consistent
with
itself
so
well
balanced
so
young
and
so
old
not
obsolete
after
so
many
centuries
but
vigorous
and
progressive
still
is
the
very
development
contemplated
in
the
divine
scheme
these
doctrines
are
members
of
one
family
and
suggestive
or
correlative
or
confirmatory
or
illustrative
of
each
other
one
furnishes
evidence
to
another
and
all
to
each
of
them
if
this
is
proved
that
becomes
probable
if
this
and
that
are
both
probable
but
for
different
reasons
each
adds
to
the
other
its
own
probability
the
incarnation
is
the
antecedent
of
the
doctrine
of
mediation
and
the
archetype
both
of
the
sacramental
principle
and
of
the
merits
of
saints
from
the
doctrine
of
mediation
follow
the
atonement
the
mass
the
merits
of
martyrs
and
saints
their
invocation
and
from
the
sacramental
principle
come
the
sacraments
properly
so
called
the
unity
of
the
church
and
the
holy
see
as
its
type
and
centre
the
authority
of
councils
the
sanctity
of
rites
the
veneration
of
holy
places
shrines
images
vessels
furniture
and
vestments
of
the
sacraments
baptism
is
developed
into
confirmation
on
the
one
hand
into
penance
purgatory
and
indulgences
on
the
other
and
the
eucharist
into
the
real
presence
adoration
of
the
host
resurrection
of
the
body
and
the
virtue
of
relics
again
the
doctrine
of
the
sacraments
leads
to
the
doctrine
of
justification
justification
to
that
of
original
sin
original
sin
to
the
merit
of
celibacy
nor
do
these
separate
developments
stand
independent
of
each
other
but
by
cross
relations
they
are
connected
and
grow
together
while
they
grow
from
one
the
mass
and
real
presence
are
parts
of
one
the
veneration
of
saints
and
their
relics
are
parts
of
one
their
intercessory
power
and
the
purgatorial
state
and
again
the
mass
and
that
state
are
correlative
celibacy
is
the
characteristic
mark
of
monachism
and
of
the
priesthood
you
must
accept
the
whole
or
reject
the
whole
attenuation
does
but
enfeeble
and
amputation
mutilate
it
is
trifling
to
receive
all
but
something
which
is
as
integral
as
any
other
portion
and
on
the
other
hand
it
is
a
solemn
thing
to
accept
any
part
for
before
you
know
where
you
are
you
may
be
carried
on
by
a
stern
logical
necessity
to
accept
the
whole
next
we
have
to
consider
that
from
first
to
last
other
developments
there
are
none
except
those
which
have
possession
of
christendom
none
that
is
of
prominence
and
permanence
sufficient
to
deserve
the
name
in
early
times
the
heretical
doctrines
were
confessedly
barren
and
and
could
not
stand
their
ground
against
catholicism
as
to
the
medieval
period
i
am
not
aware
that
the
greeks
present
more
than
a
negative
opposition
to
the
latins
and
now
in
like
manner
the
tridentine
creed
is
met
by
no
rival
developments
there
is
no
antagonist
system
criticisms
objections
protests
there
are
in
plenty
but
little
of
positive
teaching
anywhere
seldom
an
attempt
on
the
part
of
any
opposing
school
to
master
its
own
doctrines
to
investigate
their
sense
and
bearing
to
determine
their
relation
to
the
decrees
of
trent
and
their
distance
from
them
and
when
at
any
time
this
attempt
is
by
chance
in
any
measure
made
then
an
incurable
contrariety
does
but
come
to
view
between
portions
of
the
theology
thus
developed
and
a
war
of
principles
an
impossibility
moreover
of
reconciling
that
theology
with
the
general
drift
of
the
formularies
in
which
its
elements
occur
and
a
consequent
appearance
of
unfairness
and
sophistry
in
adventurous
persons
who
aim
at
forcing
them
into
consistency
and
further
a
prevalent
understanding
of
the
truth
of
this
representation
authorities
keeping
silence
eschewing
a
hopeless
enterprise
and
discouraging
it

the
people
plainly
intimating
that
they
think
both
doctrine

antiquity
and
development
of
very
little

at
all
and
lastly

evident

of
men
who
in
consequence
when
they
set
great
schemes
on
foot
as
for
the
conversion
of
the
heathen
world
are
afraid
to
agitate
the
question
of
the
doctrines
to
which
it
is
to
be
converted
lest
through
the
opened
door
they
should
lose
what
they
have
instead
of
gaining
what
they
have
not
to
the
weight
of
recommendation
which
this
contrast
throws
upon
the
developments
commonly
called
catholic
must
be
added
the
argument
which
arises
from
the
coincidence
of
their
consistency
and
permanence
with
their
claim
of
an
infallible
sanction
a
claim
the
existence
of
which
in
some
quarter
or
other
of
the
divine
dispensation
is
as
we
have
already
seen
antecedently
probable
all
these
things
being
considered
i
think
few
persons
will
deny
the
very
strong
presumption
which
exists
that
if
there
must
be
and
are
in
fact
developments
in
christianity
the
doctrines
propounded
by
successive
popes
and
councils
through
so
many
ages
are
they
a
further
presumption
in
behalf
of
these
doctrines
arises
from
the
general
opinion
of
the
world
about
them
christianity
being
one
all
its
doctrines
are
necessarily
developments
of
one
and
if
so
are
of
necessity
consistent
with
each
other
or
form
a
whole
now
the
world
fully
enters
into
this
view
of
those
developments
which
claim
the
name
of
catholic
it
allows
them
that
title
it
considers
them
to
belong
to
one
family
and
refers
them
to
one
theological
system
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
set
about
proving
what
is
urged
by
their
opponents
even
more
strenuously
than
by
their
champions
their
opponents
avow
that
they
protest
not
against
this
doctrine
or
that
but
against
one
and
all
and
they
seem
struck
with
wonder
and
perplexity
not
to
say
with
awe
at
a
consistency
which
they
feel
to
be
superhuman
though
they
would
not
allow
it
to
be
divine
the
system
is
confessed
on
all
hands
to
bear
a
character
of
integrity
and
indivisibility
upon
it
both
at
first
view
and
on
inspection
hence
such
sayings
as
the
tota
jacet
babylon
of
the
distich
luther
did
but
a
part
of
the
work
calvin
another
portion
socinus
finished
it
to
take
up
with
luther
and
to
reject
calvin
and
socinus
would
be
according
to
that
epigram
like
living
in
a
house
without
a
roof
to
it
this
i
say
is
no
private
judgment
of
this
man
or
that
but
the
common
opinion
and
experience
of
all
countries
the
two
great
divisions
of
religion
feel
it
roman
catholic
and
protestant
between
whom
the
controversy
lies
sceptics
and
liberals
who
are
spectators
of
the
conflict
feel
it
philosophers
feel
it
a
school
of
divines
there
is
i
grant
dear
to
memory
who
have
not
felt
it
and
their
exception
will
have
its
weight
till
we
reflect
that
the
particular
theology
which
they
advocate
has
not
the
prescription
of
success
never
has
been
realized
in
fact
or
if
realized
for
a
moment
had
no
stay
moreover
that
when
it
has
been
enacted
by
human
authority
it
has
scarcely
travelled
beyond
the
paper
on
which
it
was
printed
or
out
of
the
legal
forms
in
which
it
was
embodied
but
putting
the
weight
of
these
revered
names
at
the
highest
they
do
not
constitute
more
than
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
such
as
is
found
in
every
subject
that
comes
into
discussion
and
this
general
testimony
to
the
oneness
of
catholicism
extends
to
its
past
teaching
relatively
to
its
present
as
well
as
to
the
portions
of
its
present
teaching
one
with
another
no
one
doubts
with
such
exception
as
has
just
been
allowed
that
the
roman
catholic
communion
of
this
day
is
the
successor
and
representative
of
the
medieval
church
or
that
the
medieval
church
is
the
legitimate
heir
of
the
nicene
even
allowing
that
it
is
a
question
whether
a
line
can
not
be
drawn
between
the
nicene
church
and
the
church
which
preceded
it
on
the
whole
all
parties
will
agree
that
of
all
existing
systems
the
present
communion
of
rome
is
the
nearest
approximation
in
fact
to
the
church
of
the
fathers
possible
though
some
may
think
it
to
be
nearer
still
to
that
church
on
paper
did
athanasius
or
ambrose
come
suddenly
to
life
it
can
not
be
doubted
what
communion
he
would
take
to
be
his
own
all
surely
will
agree
that
these
fathers
with
whatever
opinions
of
their
own
whatever
protests
if
we
will
would
find
themselves
more
at
home
with
such
men
as
bernard
or
ignatius
loyola
or
with
the
lonely
priest
in
his
lodging
or
the
holy
sisterhood
of
mercy
or
the
unlettered
crowd
before
the
altar
than
with
the
teachers
or
with
the
members
of
any
other
creed
and
may
we
not
add
that
were
those
same
saints
who
once
sojourned
one
in
exile
one
on
embassy
at
treves
to
come
more
northward
still
and
to
travel
until
they
reached
another
fair
city
seated
among
groves
green
meadows
and
calm
streams
the
holy
brothers
would
turn
from
many
a
high
aisle
and
solemn
cloister
which
they
found
there
and
ask
the
way
to
some
small
chapel
where

was
said

i
method
of
proof
it
seems
then
that
we
have
to
deal
with
a
case
something
like
the
following
certain
doctrines
come
to
us
professing
to
be
apostolic
and
possessed
of
such
high
antiquity
that
though
we
are
only
able
to
assign
the
date
of
their
formal
establishment
to
the
fourth
or
the
fifth
or
the
eighth
or
the
thirteenth
century
as
it
may
happen
yet
their
substance
may
for
what
appears
be
coeval
with
the
apostles
and
be
expressed
or
implied
in
texts
of
scripture
further
these
existing
doctrines
are
universally
considered
without
any
question
in
each
age
to
be
the
echo
of
the
doctrines
of
the
times
immediately
preceding
them
and
thus
are
continually
thrown
back
to
a
date
indefinitely
early
even
though
their
ultimate
junction
with
the
apostolic
creed
be
out
of
sight
and
unascertainable
moreover
they
are
confessed
to
form
one
body
one
with
another
so
that
to
reject
one
is
to
disparage
the
rest
and
they
include
within
the
range
of
their
system
even
those
primary
articles
of
faith
as
the
incarnation
which
many
an
impugner
of
the
said
doctrinal
system
as
a
system
professes
to
accept
and
which
do
what
he
will
he
can
not
intelligibly
separate
whether
in
point
of
evidence
or
of
internal
character
from
others
which
he
disavows
further
these
doctrines
occupy
the
whole
field
of
theology
and
leave
nothing
to
be
supplied
except
in
detail
by
any
other
system
while
in
matter
of
fact
no
rival
system
is
forthcoming
so
that
we
have
to
choose
between
this
theology
and
none
at
all
moreover
this
theology
alone
makes
provision
for
that
guidance
of
opinion
and
conduct
which
seems
externally
to
be
the
special
aim
of
revelation
and
fulfils
the
promises
of
scripture
by
adapting
itself
to
the
various
problems
of
thought
and
practice
which
meet
us
in
life
and
further
it
is
the
nearest
approach
to
say
the
least
to
the
religious
sentiment
and
what
is
called
of
the
early
church
nay
to
that
of
the
apostles
and
prophets
for
all
will
agree
so
far
as
this
that
elijah
jeremiah
the
baptist
and
paul
are
in
their
history
and
mode
of
life
i
do
not
speak
of
measures
of
grace
no
nor
of
doctrine
and
conduct
for
these
are
the
points
in
dispute
but
in
what
is
external
and
meets
the
eye
and
this
is
no
slight
resemblance
when
things
are
viewed
as
a
whole
and
from
a
distance
these
saintly
and
heroic
men
i
say
are
more
like
a
dominican
preacher
or
a
jesuit
missionary
or
a
carmelite
friar
more
like
toribio
or
vincent
ferrer
or
francis
xavier
or
alphonso
liguori
than
to
any
individuals
or
to
any
classes
of
men
that
can
be
found
in
other
communions
and
then
in
addition
there
is
the
high
antecedent
probability
that
providence
would
watch
over
his
own
work
and
would
direct
and
ratify
those
developments
of
doctrine
which
were
inevitable
if
this
is
on
the
whole
a
true
view
of
the
general
shape
under
which
the
existing
body
of
developments
commonly
called
catholic
present
themselves
before
us
antecedently
to
our
looking
into
the
particular
evidence
on
which
they
stand
i
think
we
shall
be
at
no
loss
to
determine
what
both
logical
truth
and
duty
prescribe
to
us
as
to
our
reception
of
them
it
is
very
little
to
say
that
we
should
treat
them
as
we
are
accustomed
to
treat
other
alleged
facts
and
truths
and
the
evidence
for
them
such
as
come
to
us
with
a
fair
presumption
in
their
favour
such
are
of
every
day
occurrence
and
what
is
our
behaviour
towards
them
we
meet
them
not
with
suspicion
and
criticism
but
with
a
frank
confidence
we
do
not
in
the
first
instance
exercise
our
reason
upon
opinions
which
are
received
but
our
faith
we
do
not
begin
with
doubting
we
take
them
on
trust
and
we
put
them
on
trial
and
that
not
of
set
purpose
but
spontaneously
we
prove
them
by
using
them
by
applying
them
to
the
or
the
evidence
or
the
body
of
circumstances
to
which
they
belong
as
if
they
gave
it
its
interpretation
or
its
colour
as
a
matter
of
course
and
only
when
they
fail
in
the
event
in
illustrating
phenomena
or
harmonizing
facts
do
we
discover
that
we
must
reject
the
doctrines
or
the
statements
which
we
had
in
the
first
instance
taken
for
granted
again
we
take
the
evidence
for
them
whatever
it
be
as
a
whole
as
forming
a
combined
proof
and
we
interpret
what
is
obscure
in
separate
portions
by
such
portions
as
are
clear
moreover
we
bear
with
these
in
proportion
to
the
strength
of
the
antecedent
probability
in
their
favour
we
are
patient
with
difficulties
in
their
application
with
apparent
objections
to
them
drawn
from
other
matters
of
fact
deficiency
in
their
comprehensiveness
or
want
of
neatness
in
their
working
provided
their
claims
on
our
attention
are
considerable
thus
most
men
take
newton
theory
of
gravitation
for
granted
because
it
is
generally
received
and
use
it
without
rigidly
testing
it
first
each
for
himself
as
it
can
be
tested
by
phenomena
and
if
phenomena
are
found
which
it
does
not
satisfactorily
solve
this
does
not
trouble
us
for
a
way
there
must
be
of
explaining
them
consistently
with
that
theory
though
it
does
not
occur
to
ourselves
again
if
we
found
a
concise
or
obscure
passage
in
one
of
cicero
letters
to
atticus
we
should
not
scruple
to
admit
as
its
true
explanation
a
more
explicit
statement
in
his
√¶schylus
is
illustrated
by
sophocles
in
point
of
language
and
thucydides
by
aristophanes
in
point
of
history
horace
persius
suetonius
tacitus
and
juvenal
may
be
made
to
throw
light
upon
each
other
even
plato
may
gain
a
commentator
in
plotinus
and
anselm
is
interpreted
by
thomas
two
writers
indeed
may
be
already
known
to
differ
and
then
we
do
not
join
them
together
as
to
common
truths
luther
has
taken
on
himself
to
explain
augustine
and
voltaire
pascal
without
persuading
the
world
that
they
have
a
claim
to
do
so
but
in
no
case
do
we
begin
with
asking
whether
a
comment
does
not
disagree
with
its
text
when
there
is
a
congruity
between
them
we
elucidate
the
text
by
the
comment
though
or
rather
because
the
comment
is
fuller
and
more
explicit
than
the
text
thus
too
we
deal
with
scripture
when
we
have
to
interpret
the
prophetical
text
and
the
types
of
the
old
testament
the
event
which
is
the
development
is
also
the
interpretation
of
the
prediction
it
provides
a
fulfilment
by
imposing
a
meaning
and
we
accept
certain
events
as
the
fulfilment
of
prophecy
from
the
broad
correspondence
of
the
one
with
the
other
in
spite
of
many
incidental
difficulties
the
difficulty
for
instance
in
accounting
for
the
fact
that
the
dispersion
of
the
jews
followed
upon
their
keeping
not
their
departing
from
their
law
does
not
hinder
us
from
insisting
on
their
present
state
as
an
argument
against
the
infidel
again
we
readily
submit
our
reason
on
competent
authority
and
accept
certain
events
as
an
accomplishment
of
predictions
which
seem
very
far
removed
from
them
as
in
the
passage
out
of
egypt
have
i
called
my
son
nor
do
we
find
a
difficulty
when
paul
appeals
to
a
text
of
the
old
testament
which
stands
otherwise
in
our
hebrew
copies
as
the
words
a
body
hast
thou
prepared
me
we
receive
such
difficulties
on
faith
and
leave
them
to
take
care
of
themselves
much
less
do
we
consider
mere
fulness
in
the
interpretation
or
definiteness
or
again
strangeness
as
a
sufficient
reason
for
depriving
the
text
or
the
action
to
which
it
is
applied
of
the
advantage
of
such
interpretation
we
make
it
no
objection
that
the
words
themselves
come
short
of
it
or
that
the
sacred
writer
did
not
contemplate
it
or
that
a
previous
fulfilment
satisfies
it
a
reader
who
came
to
the
inspired
text
by
himself
beyond
the
influence
of
that
traditional
acceptation
which
happily
encompasses
it
would
be
surprised
to
be
told
that
the
prophet
words
a
virgin
shall
conceive
or
let
all
the
angels
of
god
worship
him
refer
to
our
lord
but
assuming
the
intimate
connexion
between
judaism
and
christianity
and
the
inspiration
of
the
new
testament
we
do
not
scruple
to
believe
it
we
rightly
feel
that
it
is
no
prejudice
to
our
receiving
the
prophecy
of
balaam
in
its
christian
meaning
that
it
is
adequately
fulfilled
in
david
or
the
history
of
jonah
that
it
is
poetical
in
character
and
has
a
moral
in
itself
like
an
apologue
or
the
meeting
of
abraham
and
melchizedek
that
it
is
too
brief
and
simple
to
mean
any
great
thing
as
paul
interprets
it
butler
corroborates
these
remarks
when
speaking
of
the
particular
evidence
for
christianity
the
obscurity
or
unintelligibleness
he
says
of
one
part
of
a
prophecy
does
not
in
any
degree
invalidate
the
proof
of
foresight
arising
from
the
appearing
completion
of
those
other
parts
which
are
understood
for
the
case
is
evidently
the
same
as
if
those
parts
which
are
not
understood
were
lost
or
not
written
at
all
or
written
in
an
unknown
tongue
whether
this
observation
be
commonly
attended
to
or
not
it
is
so
evident
that
one
can
scarce
bring
self
to
set
down
an
instance
in
common
matters
to
exemplify
it
he
continues
though
a
man
should
be
incapable
for
want
of
learning
or
opportunities
of
inquiry
or
from
not
having
turned
his
studies
this
way
even
so
much
as
to
judge
whether
particular
prophecies
have
been
throughout
completely
fulfilled
yet
he
may
see
in
general
that
they
have
been
fulfilled
to
such
a
degree
as
upon
very
good
ground
to
be
convinced
of
foresight
more
than
human
in
such
prophecies
and
of
such
events
being
intended
by
them
for
the
same
reason
also
though
by
means
of
the
deficiencies
in
civil
history
and
the
different
accounts
of
historians
the
most
learned
should
not
be
able
to
make
out
to
satisfaction
that
such
parts
of
the
prophetic
history
have
been
minutely
and
throughout
fulfilled
yet
a
very
strong
proof
of
foresight
may
arise
from
that
general
completion
of
them
which
is
made
out
as
much
proof
of
foresight
perhaps
as
the
giver
of
prophecy
intended
should
ever
be
afforded
by
such
parts
of
prophecy
he
illustrates
this
by
the
parallel
instance
of
fable
and
concealed
satire
a
man
might
be
assured
that
he
understood
what
an
author
intended
by
a
fable
or
parable
related
without
any
application
or
moral
merely
from
seeing
it
to
be
easily
capable
of
such
application
and
that
such
a
moral
might
naturally
be
deduced
from
it
and
he
might
be
fully
assured
that
such
persons
and
events
were
intended
in
a
satirical
writing
merely
from
its
being
applicable
to
them
and
agreeably
to
the
last
observation
he
might
be
in
a
good
measure
satisfied
of
it
though
he
were
not
enough
informed
in
affairs
or
in
the
story
of
such
persons
to
understand
half
the
satire
for
his
satisfaction
that
he
understood
the
meaning
the
intended
meaning
of
these
writings
would
be
greater
or
less
in
proportion
as
he
saw
the
general
turn
of
them
to
be
capable
of
such
application
and
in
proportion
to
the
number
of
particular
things
capable
of
it
and
he
infers
hence
that
if
a
known
course
of
events
or
the
history
of
a
person
as
our
lord
is
found
to
answer
on
the
whole
to
the
prophetical
text
it
becomes
fairly
the
right
interpretation
of
that
text
in
spite
of
difficulties
in
detail
and
this
rule
of
interpretation
admits
of
an
obvious
application
to
the
parallel
case
of
doctrinal
passages
when
a
certain
creed
which
professes
to
have
been
derived
from
revelation
comes
recommended
to
us
on
strong
antecedent
grounds
and
presents
no
strong
opposition
to
the
sacred
text
the
same
author
observes
that
the
first
fulfilment
of
a
prophecy
is
no
valid
objection
to
a
second
when
what
seems
like
a
second
has
once
taken
place
and
in
like
manner
an
interpretation
of
doctrinal
texts
may
be
literal
exact
and
sufficient
yet
in
spite
of
all
this
may
not
embrace
what
is
really
the
full
scope
of
their
meaning
and
that
fuller
scope
if
it
so
happen
may
be
less
satisfactory
and
precise
as
an
interpretation
than
their
primary
and
narrow
sense
thus
if
the
protestant
interpretation
of
the
sixth
chapter
of
john
were
true
and
sufficient
for
its
letter
which
of
course
i
do
not
grant
that
would
not
hinder
the
roman
which
at
least
is
quite
compatible
with
the
text
being
the
higher
sense
and
the
only
rightful
in
such
cases
the
justification
of
the
larger
and
higher
interpretation
lies
in
some
antecedent
probability
such
as
catholic
consent
and
the
ground
of
the
narrow
is
the
context
and
the
rules
of
grammar
and
whereas
the
argument
of
the
critical
commentator
is
that
the
sacred
text
mean
more
than
the
letter
those
who
adopt
a
deeper
view
of
it
maintain
as
butler
in
the
case
of
prophecy
that
we
have
no
warrant
for
putting
a
limit
to
the
sense
of
words
which
are
not
human
but
divine
now
it
is
but
a
parallel
exercise
of
reasoning
to
interpret
the
previous
history
of
a
doctrine
by
its
later
development
and
to
consider
that
it
contains
the
later
and
in
the
divine
intention
and
the
grudging
and
jealous
temper
which
refuses
to
enlarge
the
sacred
text
for
the
fulfilment
of
prophecy
is
the
very
same
that
will
occupy
itself
in
carping
at
the
testimonies
for
nicene
or
medieval
doctrines
and
usages
when
i
and
my
father
are
one
is
urged
in
proof
of
our
lord
unity
with
the
father
heretical
disputants
do
not
see
why
the
words
must
be
taken
to
denote
more
than
a
unity
of
will
when
this
is
my
body
is
alleged
as
a
warrant
for
the
change
of
the
bread
into
the
body
of
christ
they
explain
away
the
words
into
a
figure
because
such
is
their
most
obvious
interpretation
and
in
like
manner
when
roman
catholics
urge
gregory
invocations
they
are
told
that
these
are
but
rhetorical
or
clement
allusion
to
purgatory
that
perhaps
it
was
platonism
or
origen
language
about
praying
to
angels
and
the
merits
of
martyrs
that
it
is
but
an
instance
of
his
heterodoxy
or
cyprian
exaltation
of
the
that
he
need
not
be
contemplating
more
than
a
figurative
or
abstract
see
or
the
general
testimony
to
the
spiritual
authority
of
rome
in
primitive
times
that
it
arose
from
her
temporal
greatness
or
tertullian
language
about
tradition
and
the
church
that
he
took
a
lawyer
view
of
those
subjects
whereas
the
early
condition
and
the
evidence
of
each
doctrine
respectively
ought
consistently
to
be
interpreted
by
means
of
that
development
which
was
ultimately
attained
moreover
since
as
above
shown
the
doctrines
all
together
make
up
one
integral
religion
it
follows
that
the
several
evidences
which
respectively
support
those
doctrines
belong
to
a
whole
and
must
be
thrown
into
a
common
stock
and
all
are
available
in
the
defence
of
any
a
collection
of
weak
evidences
makes
up
a
strong
evidence
again
one
strong
argument
imparts
cogency
to
collateral
arguments
which
are
in
themselves
weak
for
instance
as
to
the
miracles
whether
of
scripture
or
the
church
the
number
of
those
which
carry
with
them
their
own
proof
now
and
are
believed
for
their
own
sake
is
small
and
they
furnish
the
grounds
on
which
we
receive
the
rest
again
no
one
would
fancy
it
necessary
before
receiving
matthew
gospel
to
find
primitive
testimony
in
behalf
of
every
chapter
and
verse
when
only
part
is
proved
to
have
been
in
existence
in
ancient
times
the
whole
is
proved
because
that
part
is
but
part
of
a
whole
and
when
the
whole
is
proved
it
may
shelter
such
parts
as
for
some
incidental
reason
have
less
evidence
of
their
antiquity
again
it
would
be
enough
to
show
that
augustine
knew
the
italic
version
of
the
scriptures
if
he
quoted
it
once
or
twice
and
in
like
manner
it
will
be
generally
admitted
that
the
proof
of
a
second
person
in
the
godhead
lightens
greatly
the
burden
of
proof
necessary
for
belief
in
a
third
person
and
that
the
atonement
being
in
some
sort
a
correlative
of
eternal
punishment
the
evidence
for
the
former
doctrine
virtually
increases
the
evidence
for
the
latter
and
so
a
protestant
controversialist
would
feel
that
it
told
little
except
as
an
omen
of
victory
to
reduce
an
opponent
to
a
denial
of
transubstantiation
if
he
still
adhered
firmly
to
the
invocation
of
saints
purgatory
the
seven
sacraments
and
the
doctrine
of
merit
and
little
too
for
one
of
his
own
party
to
condemn
the
adoration
of
the
host
the
supremacy
of
rome
the
acceptableness
of
celibacy
auricular
confession
communion
under
one
kind
and
tradition
if
he
was
zealous
for
the
doctrine
of
the
immaculate
conception
the
principle
on
which
these
remarks
are
made
has
the
sanction
of
some
of
the
deepest
of
english
divines
bishop
butler
for
instance
who
has
so
often
been
quoted
here
thus
argues
in
behalf
of
christianity
itself
though
confessing
at
the
same
time
the
disadvantage
which
in
consequence
the
revealed
system
lies
under
probable
proofs
he
observes
by
being
added
not
only
increase
the
evidence
but
multiply
it
nor
should
i
dissuade
any
one
from
setting
down
what
he
thought
made
for
the
contrary
side
the
truth
of
our
religion
like
the
truth
of
common
matters
is
to
be
judged
by
all
the
evidence
taken
together
and
unless
the
whole
series
of
things
which
may
be
alleged
in
this
argument
and
every
particular
thing
in
it
can
reasonably
be
supposed
to
have
been
by
accident
for
here
the
stress
of
the
argument
for
christianity
lies
then
is
the
truth
of
it
proved
in
like
manner
as
if
in
any
common
case
numerous
events
acknowledged
were
to
be
alleged
in
proof
of
any
other
event
disputed
the
truth
of
the
disputed
event
would
be
proved
not
only
if
any
one
of
the
acknowledged
ones
did
of
itself
clearly
imply
it
but
though
no
one
of
them
singly
did
so
if
the
whole
of
the
acknowledged
events
taken
together
could
not
in
reason
be
supposed
to
have
happened
unless
the
disputed
one
were
true
it
is
obvious
how
much
advantage
the
nature
of
this
evidence
gives
to
those
persons
who
attack
christianity
especially
in
conversation
for
it
is
easy
to
show
in
a
short
and
lively
manner
that
such
and
such
things
are
liable
to
objection
that
this
and
another
thing
is
of
little
weight
in
itself
but
impossible
to
show
in
like
manner
the
united
force
of
the
whole
argument
in
one
view
in
like
manner
davison
condemns
that
vicious
manner
of
reasoning
which
represents
any
insufficiency
of
the
proof
in
its
several
branches
as
so
much
objection
which
manages
the
inquiry
so
as
to
make
it
appear
that
if
the
divided
arguments
be
inconclusive
one
by
one
we
have
a
series
of
exceptions
to
the
truths
of
religion
instead
of
a
train
of
favourable
presumptions
growing
stronger
at
every
step
the
disciple
of
scepticism
is
taught
that
he
can
not
fully
rely
on
this
or
that
motive
of
belief
that
each
of
them
is
insecure
and
the
conclusion
is
put
upon
him
that
they
ought
to
be
discarded
one
after
another
instead
of
being
connected
and
combined
no
work
perhaps
affords
more
specimens
in
a
short
compass
of
the
breach
of
the
principle
of
reasoning
inculcated
in
these
passages
than
barrow
treatise
on
the
pope
supremacy
the
remarks
of
these
two
writers
relate
to
the
duty
of
combining
doctrines
which
belong
to
one
body
and
evidences
which
relate
to
one
subject
and
few
persons
would
dispute
it
in
the
abstract
the
application
which
has
been
here
made
of
the
principle
is
this
that
where
a
doctrine
comes
recommended
to
us
by
strong
presumptions
of
its
truth
we
are
bound
to
receive
it
unsuspiciously
and
use
it
as
a
key
to
the
evidences
to
which
it
appeals
or
the
facts
which
it
professes
to
systematize
whatever
may
be
our
eventual
judgment
about
it
nor
is
it
enough
to
answer
that
the
voice
of
our
particular
church
denying
this
catholicism
is
an
antecedent
probability
which
outweighs
all
others
and
claims
our
prior
obedience
loyally
and
without
reasoning
to
its
own
interpretation
this
may
excuse
individuals
certainly
in
beginning
with
doubt
and
distrust
of
the
catholic
developments
but
it
only
shifts
the
blame
to
the
particular
church
anglican
or
other
which
thinks
itself
qualified
to
enforce
so
peremptory
a
judgment
against
the
one
and
only
successor
heir
and
representative
of
the

of

bacon
is
celebrated
for
destroying
the
credit
of
a
method
of
reasoning
much
resembling
that
which
it
has
been
the
object
of
this
chapter
to
recommend
he
who
is
not
practised
in
doubting
he
says
but
forward
in
asserting
and
laying
down
such
principles
as
he
takes
to
be
approved
granted
and
manifest
and
according
to
the
established
truth
thereof
receives
or
rejects
everything
as
squaring
with
or
proving
contrary
to
them
is
only
fitted
to
mix
and
confound
things
with
words
reason
with
madness
and
the
world
with
fable
and
fiction
but
not
to
interpret
the
works
of

but
he
was
aiming
at
the
application
of
these
modes
of
reasoning
to
what
should
be
strict
investigation
and
that
in
the
province
of
physics
and
this
he
might
well
censure
without
attempting
what
is
impossible
to
banish
them
from
history
ethics
and
religion
physical
facts
are
present
they
are
submitted
to
the
senses
and
the
senses
may
be
satisfactorily
tested
corrected
and
verified
to
trust
to
anything
but
sense
in
a
matter
of
sense
is
irrational
why
are
the
senses
given
us
but
to
supersede
less
certain
less
immediate
informants
we
have
recourse
to
reason
or
authority
to
determine
facts
when
the
senses
fail
us
but
with
the
senses
we
begin
we
deduce
we
form
inductions
we
abstract
we
theorize
from
facts
we
do
not
begin
with
surmise
and
conjecture
much
less
do
we
look
to
the
tradition
of
past
ages
or
the
decree
of
foreign
teachers
to
determine
matters
which
are
in
our
hands
and
under
our
eyes
but
it
is
otherwise
with
history
the
facts
of
which
are
not
present
it
is
otherwise
with
ethics
in
which
phenomena
are
more
subtle
closer
and
more
personal
to
individuals
than
other
facts
and
not
referable
to
any
common
standard
by
which
all
men
can
decide
upon
them
in
such
sciences
we
can
not
rest
upon
mere
facts
if
we
would
because
we
have
not
got
them
we
must
do
our
best
with
what
is
given
us
and
look
about
for
aid
from
any
quarter
and
in
such
circumstances
the
opinions
of
others
the

of

the
prescriptions
of

parallel

these
and
the
like
not
indeed
taken
at
random
but
like
the
evidence
from
the
senses
sifted
and
scrutinized
obviously
become
of
great
importance
and
further
if
we
proceed
on
the
hypothesis
that
a
merciful
providence
has
supplied
us
with
means
of
gaining
such
truth
as
concerns
us
in
different
though
with
different
instruments
then
the
simple
question
is
what
those
instruments
are
which
are
proper
to
a
particular
case
if
they
are
of
the
appointment
of
a
divine
protector
we
may
be
sure
that
they
will
lead
to
the
truth
whatever
they
are
the
less
exact
methods
of
reasoning
may
do
his
work
as
well
as
the
more
perfect
if
he
blesses
them
he
may
bless
antecedent
probabilities
in
ethical
inquiries
who
blesses
experience
and
induction
in
the
art
of
medicine
and
if
it
is
reasonable
to
consider
medicine
or
architecture
or
engineering
in
a
certain
sense
divine
arts
as
being
divinely
ordained
means
of
our
receiving
divine
benefits
much
more
may
ethics
be
called
divine
while
as
to
religion
it
directly
professes
to
be
the
method
of
recommending
ourselves
to
him
and
learning
his
will
if
then
it
be
his
gracious
purpose
that
we
should
learn
it
the
means
he
gives
for
learning
it
be
they
promising
or
not
to
human
eyes
are
sufficient
because
they
are
his
and
what
they
are
at
this
particular
time
or
to
this
person
depends
on
his
disposition
he
may
have
imposed
simple
prayer
and
obedience
on
some
men
as
the
instrument
of
their
attaining
to
the
mysteries
and
precepts
of
christianity
he
may
lead
others
through
the
written
word
at
least
for
some
stages
of
their
course
and
if
the
formal
basis
on
which
he
has
rested
his
revelations
be
as
it
is
of
an
historical
and
philosophical
character
then
antecedent
probabilities
subsequently
corroborated
by
facts
will
be
sufficient
as
in
the
parallel
case
of
other
history
to
bring
us
safely
to
the
matter
or
at
least
to
the
organ
of
those
revelations
moreover
in
subjects
which
belong
to
moral
proof
such
i
mean
as
history
antiquities
political
science
ethics
metaphysics
and
theology
which
are
such
and
especially
in
theology
and
ethics
antecedent
probability
may
have
a
real
weight
and
cogency
which
it
can
not
have
in
experimental
science
and
a
mature
politician
or
divine
may
have
a
power
of
reaching
matters
of
fact
in
consequence
of
his
peculiar
habits
of
mind
which
is
seldom
given
in
the
same
degree
to
physical
inquirers
who
for
the
purposes
of
this
particular
pursuit
are
very
much
on
a
level
and
this
last
remark
at
least
is
confirmed
by
lord
bacon
who
confesses
our
method
of
discovering
the
sciences
does
not
much
depend
upon
subtlety
and
strength
of
genius
but
lies
level
to
almost
every
capacity
and
understanding
though
surely
sciences
there
are
in
which
genius
is
everything
and
rules
all
but
nothing
it
will
be
a
great
mistake
then
to
suppose
that
because
this
eminent
philosopher
condemned
presumption
and
prescription
in
inquiries
into
facts
which
are
external
to
us
present
with
us
and
common
to
us
all
therefore
authority
tradition
verisimilitude
analogy
and
the
like
are
mere
idols
of
the
den
or
of
the
theatre
in
history
or
ethics
here
we
may
oppose
to
him
an
author
in
his
own
line
as
great
as
he
is
experience
says
bacon
is
by
far
the
best
demonstration
provided
it
dwell
in
the
experiment
for
the
transferring
of
it
to
other
things
judged
alike
is
very
fallacious
unless
done
with
great
exactness
and
regularity
niebuhr
explains
or
corrects
him
instances
are
not
arguments
he
grants
when
investigating
an
obscure
question
of
roman
history
instances
are
not
arguments
but
in
history
are
scarcely
of
less
force
above
all
where
the
parallel
they
exhibit
is
in
the
progressive
development
of
institutions
here
this
sagacious
writer
recognizes
the
true
principle
of
historical
logic
while
he
exemplifies
it
the
same
principle
is
involved
in
the
maxim
of
aristotle
that
it
is
much
the
same
to
admit
the
probabilities
of
a
mathematician
and
to
look
for
demonstration
from
an
orator
in
all
matters
of
human
life
presumption
verified
by
instances
is
our
ordinary
instrument
of
proof
and
if
the
antecedent
probability
is
great
it
almost
supersedes
instances
of
course
as
is
plain
we
may
err
grievously
in
the
antecedent
view
which
we
start
with
and
in
that
case
our
conclusions
may
be
wide
of
the
truth
but
that
only
shows
that
we
had
no
right
to
assume
a
premiss
which
was
untrustworthy
not
that
our
reasoning
was
faulty
i
am
speaking
of
the
process
itself
and
its
correctness
is
shown
by
its
general
adoption
in
religious
questions
a
single
text
of
scripture
is
with
most
people
whether
the
well
disposed
or
the
prejudiced
to
prove
a
doctrine
or
a
duty
in
cases
when
a
custom
is
established
or
a
tradition
is
strong
not
forsaking
the
assembling
of
ourselves
together
is
sufficient
for
establishing
social
public
nay
sunday
worship
where
the
tree
falleth
there
shall
it
lie
shows
that
our
probation
ends
with
life
forbidding
to
marry
determines
the
pope
to
be
the
man
of
sin
again
it
is
plain
that
a
man
after
course
for
good
or
bad
brings
out
the
passing
words
or
obscure
actions
of
previous
years
then
on
a
retrospect
we
use
the
event
as
a
presumptive
interpretation
of
the
past
of
those
past
indications
of
his
character
which
considered
as
evidence
were
too
few
and
doubtful
to
bear
insisting
on
at
the
time
and
would
have
seemed
ridiculous
had
we
attempted
to
do
so
and
the
antecedent
probability
is
even
found
to
triumph
over
contrary
evidence
as
well
as
to
sustain
what
agrees
with
it
every
one
may
know
of
cases
in
which
a
plausible
charge
against
an
individual
was
borne
down
at
once
by
weight
of
character
though
that
character
was
incommensurate
of
course
with
the
circumstances
which
gave
rise
to
suspicion
and
had
no
direct
neutralizing
force
to
destroy
it
on
the
other
hand
it
is
sometimes
said
and
even
if
not
literally
true
will
serve
in
illustration
that
not
a
few
of
those
who
are
put
on
trial
in
our
criminal
courts
are
not
legally
guilty
of
the
particular
crime
on
which
a
verdict
is
found
against
them
being
convicted
not
so
much
upon
the
particular
evidence
as
on
the
presumption
arising
from
their
want
of
character
and
the
memory
of
their
former
offences
nor
is
it
in
slight
matters
only
or
unimportant
that
we
thus
act
our
dearest
interests
our
personal
welfare
our
property
our
health
our
reputation
we
freely
hazard
not
on
proof
but
on
a
simple
probability
which
is
sufficient
for
our
conviction
because
prudence
dictates
to
us
so
to
take
it
we
must
be
content
to
follow
the
law
of
our
being
in
religious
matters
as
well
as
in
secular
but
there
is
more
to
say
on
the
subordinate
position
which
direct
evidence
holds
among
the
of
conviction
in
most
matters
it
is
no
paradox
to
say
that
there
is
a
certain
scantiness
nay
an
absence
of
evidence
which
may
even
tell
in
favour
of
statements
which
require
to
be
made
good
there
are
indeed
cases
in
which
we
can
not
discover
the
law
of
silence
or
deficiency
which
are
then
simply
unaccountable
thus
lucian
for
whatever
reason
hardly
notices
roman
authors
or
affairs
maximus
tyrius
who
wrote
several
of
his
works
at
rome
nevertheless
makes
no
reference
to
roman
history
paterculus
the
historian
is
mentioned
by
no
ancient
writer
except
priscian
what
is
more
to
our
present
purpose
seneca
pliny
the
elder
and
plutarch
are
altogether
silent
about
christianity
and
perhaps
epictetus
also
and
the
emperor
marcus
the
jewish
mishna
too
compiled
about
is
silent
about
christianity
and
the
jerusalem
and
babylonish
talmuds
almost
so
though
the
one
was
compiled
about
and
the
other
eusebius
again
is
very
uncertain
in
his
notice
of
facts
he
does
not
speak
of
methodius
nor
of
anthony
nor
of
the
martyrdom
of
perpetua
nor
of
the
miraculous
powers
of
gregory
thaumaturgus
and
he
mentions
constantine
luminous
cross
not
in
his
ecclesiastical
history
where
it
would
naturally
find
a
place
but
in
his
life
of
the
emperor
moreover
those
who
receive
that
wonderful
occurrence
which
is
as
one
who
rejects
it
allows
so
inexplicable
to
the
historical
inquirer
have
to
explain
the
difficulty
of
the
universal
silence
on
the
subject
of
all
the
fathers
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
excepting
eusebius
in
like
manner
scripture
has
its
unexplained
omissions
no
religious
school
finds
its
own
tenets
and
usages
on
the
surface
of
it
the
remark
applies
also
to
the
very
context
of
scripture
as
in
the
obscurity
which
hangs
over
nathanael
or
the
magdalen
it
is
a
remarkable
circumstance
that
there
is
no
direct
intimation
all
through
scripture
that
the
serpent
mentioned
in
the
temptation
of
eve
was
the
evil
spirit
till
we
come
to
the
vision
of
the
woman
and
child
and
their
adversary
the
dragon
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
apocalypse
omissions
thus
absolute
and
singular
when
they
occur
in
the
evidence
of
facts
or
doctrines
are
of
course
difficulties
on
the
other
hand
not
unfrequently
they
admit
of
explanation
silence
may
arise
from
the
very
notoriety
of
the
facts
in
question
as
in
the
case
of
the
seasons
the
weather
or
other
natural
phenomena
or
from
their
sacredness
as
the
athenians
would
not
mention
the
mythological
furies
or
from
external
constraint
as
the
omission
of
the
statues
of
brutus
and
cassius
in
the
procession
or
it
may
proceed
from
fear
or
disgust
as
on
the
arrival
of
unwelcome
news
or
from
indignation
or
hatred
or
contempt
or
perplexity
as
josephus
is
silent
about
christianity
and
eusebius
passes
over
the
death
of
crispus
in
his
life
of
constantine
or
from
other
strong
feeling
as
implied
in
the
poet
sentiment
give
sorrow
words
or
from
policy
or
other
prudential
motive
or
propriety
as
queen
speeches
do
not
mention
individuals
however
influential
in
the
political
world
and
newspapers
after
a
time
were
silent
about
the
cholera
or
again
from
the
natural
and
gradual
course
which
the
fact
took
as
in
the
instance
of
inventions
and
discoveries
the
history
of
which
is
on
this
account
often
obscure
or
from
loss
of
documents
or
other
direct
testimonies
as
we
should
not
look
for
theological
information
in
a
treatise
on
geology
again
it
frequently
happens
that
omissions
proceed
on
some
law
as
the
varying
influence
of
an
external
cause
and
then
so
far
from
being
a
perplexity
they
may
even
confirm
such
evidence
as
occurs
by
becoming
as
it
were
its
correlative
for
instance
an
obstacle
may
be
assignable
person
or
principle
or
accident
which
ought
if
it
exists
to
reduce
or
distort
the
indications
of
a
fact
to
that
very
point
or
in
that
very
direction
or
with
the
variations
or
in
the
order
and
succession
which
do
occur
in
its
actual
history
at
first
sight
it
might
be
a
suspicious
circumstance
that
but
one
or
two
manuscripts
of
some
celebrated
document
were
forthcoming
but
if
it
were
known
that
the
sovereign
power
had
exerted
itself
to
suppress
and
destroy
it
at
the
time
of
its
publication
and
that
the
extant
manuscripts
were
found
just
in
those
places
where
history
witnessed
to
the
failure
of
the
attempt
the
coincidence
would
be
highly
corroborative
of
that
evidence
which
alone
remained
thus
it
is
possible
to
have
too
much
evidence
that
is
evidence
so
full
or
exact
as
to
throw
suspicion
over
the
case
for
which
it
is
adduced
the
genuine
epistles
of
ignatius
contain
none
of
those
ecclesiastical
terms
such
as
priest
or
see
which
are
so
frequent
afterwards
and
they
quote
scripture
sparingly
the
interpolated
epistles
quote
it
largely
that
is
they
are
too
scriptural
to
be
apostolic
few
persons
again
who
are
acquainted
with
the
primitive
theology
but
will
be
sceptical
at
first
reading
of
the
authenticity
of
such
works
as
the
longer
creed
of
gregory
thaumaturgus
or
hippolytus
contra
beronem
from
the
precision
of
the
theological
language
which
is
unsuitable
to
the
period
the
influence
of
circumstances
upon
the
expression
of
opinion
or
testimony
supplies
another
form
of
the
same
law
of
omission
i
am
ready
to
admit
says
paley
that
the
ancient
christian
advocates
did
not
insist
upon
the
miracles
in
argument
so
frequently
as
i
should
have
done
it
was
their
lot
to
contend
with
notions
of
magical
agency
against
which
the
mere
production
of
the
facts
was
not
sufficient
for
the
convincing
of
their
adversaries
i
do
not
know
whether
they
themselves
thought
it
quite
decisive
of
the
controversy
but
since
it
is
proved
i
conceive
with
certainty
that
the
sparingness
with
which
they
appealed
to
miracles
was
owing
neither
to
their
ignorance
nor
their
doubt
of
the
facts
it
is
at
any
rate
an
objection
not
to
the
truth
of
the
history
but
to
the
judgment
of
its
defenders
and
in
like
manner
christians
were
not
likely
to
entertain
the
question
of
the
abstract
allowableness
of
images
in
the
catholic
ritual
with
the
actual
superstitions
and
immoralities
of
paganism
before
their
eyes
nor
were
they
likely
to
determine
the
place
of
the
blessed
mary
in
our
reverence
before
they
had
duly
secured
in
the
affections
of
the
faithful
the
supreme
glory
and
worship
of
god
incarnate
her
eternal
lord
and
son
nor
would
they
recognize
purgatory
as
a
part
of
the
dispensation
till
the
world
had
flowed
into
the
church
and
a
habit
of
corruption
had
been
largely
superinduced
nor
could
ecclesiastical
liberty
be
asserted
till
it
had
been
assailed
nor
would
a
pope
arise
but
in
proportion
as
the
church
was
consolidated
nor
would
monachism
be
needed
while
martyrdoms
were
in
progress
nor
could
clement
give
judgment
on
the
doctrine
of
berengarius
nor
dionysius
refute
the
ubiquists
nor
iren√¶us
denounce
the
protestant
view
of
justification
nor
cyprian
draw
up
a
theory
of
toleration
there
is
a
time
for
every
purpose
under
the
heaven
a
time
to
keep
silence
and
a
time
to
speak
sometimes
when
the
want
of
evidence
for
a
series
of
facts
or
doctrines
is
unaccountable
an
unexpected
explanation
or
addition
in
the
course
of
time
is
found
as
regards
a
portion
of
them
which
suggests
a
ground
of
patience
as
regards
the
historical
obscurity
of
the
rest
two
instances
are
obvious
to
mention
of
an
accidental
silence
of
clear
primitive
testimony
as
to
important
doctrines
and
its
removal
in
the
number
of
the
articles
of
catholic
belief
which
the
reformation
especially
resisted
were
the
mass
and
the
sacramental
virtue
of
ecclesiastical
unity
since
the
date
of
that
movement
the
shorter
epistles
of
ignatius
have
been
discovered
and
the
early
liturgies
verified
and
this
with
most
men
has
put
an
end
to
the
controversy
about
those
doctrines
the
good
fortune
which
has
happened
to
them
may
happen
to
others
and
though
it
does
not
yet
that
it
has
happened
to
them
is
to
those
others
a
sort
of
compensation
for
the
obscurity
in
which
their
early
history
continues
to
be
involved
i
may
seem
in
these
remarks
to
be
preparing
the
way
for
a
broad
admission
of
the
absence
of
any
sanction
in
primitive
christianity
in
behalf
of
its
medieval
form
but
i
do
not
make
them
with
this
intention
not
from
misgivings
of
this
kind
but
from
the
claims
of
a
sound
logic
i
think
it
right
to
insist
that
whatever
early
testimonies
i
may
bring
in
support
of
later
developments
of
doctrine
are
in
great
measure
brought
a
matter
of
grace
not
of
compulsion
the
is
with
those
who
assail
a
teaching
which
is
and
has
long
been
in
possession
as
for
positive
evidence
in
our
behalf
they
must
take
what
they
can
get
if
they
can
not
get
as
much
as
they
might
wish
inasmuch
as
antecedent
probabilities
as
i
have
said
go
so
very
far
towards
dispensing
with
it
it
is
a
first
strong
point
that
in
an
idea
such
as
christianity
developments
can
not
but
be
and
those
surely
divine
because
it
is
divine
a
second
that
if
so
they
are
those
very
ones
which
exist
because
there
are
no
others
and
a
third
point
is
the
fact
that
they
are
found
just
there
where
true
developments
ought
to
be
found
namely
in
the
historic
seats
of
apostolical
teaching
and
in
the
authoritative
homes
of
immemorial
tradition
and
if
it
be
said
in
reply
that
the
difficulty
of
admitting
these
developments
of
doctrine
lies
not
merely
in
the
absence
of
early
testimony
for
them
but
in
the
actual
existence
of
distinct
testimony
against
them
or
as
chillingworth
says
in
popes
against
popes
councils
against
councils
i
answer
of
course
this
will
be
said
but
let
the
fact
of
this
objection
be
carefully
examined
and
its
value
reduced
to
its
true
measure
before
it
is
used
in
argument
i
grant
that
there
are
bishops
against
bishops
in
church
history
fathers
against
fathers
fathers
against
themselves
for
such
differences
in
individual
writers
are
consistent
with
or
rather
are
involved
in
the
very
idea
of
doctrinal
development
and
consequently
are
no
real
objection
to
it
the
one
essential
question
is
whether
the
recognized
organ
of
teaching
the
church
herself
acting
through
pope
or
council
as
the
oracle
of
heaven
has
ever
contradicted
her
own
enunciations
if
so
the
hypothesis
which
i
am
advocating
is
at
once
shattered
but
till
i
have
positive
and
distinct
evidence
of
the
fact
i
am
slow
to
give
credence
to
the

instances
in
illustration
it
follows
now
to
inquire
how
much
evidence
is
actually
producible
for
those
large
portions
of
the
present
creed
of
christendom
which
have
not
a
recognized
place
in
the
primordial
idea
and
the
historical
outline
of
the
religion
yet
which
come
to
us
with
certain
antecedent
considerations
strong
enough
in
reason
to
raise
the
effectiveness
of
that
evidence
to
a
point
disproportionate
as
i
have
allowed
to
its
intrinsic
value
in
urging
these
considerations
here
of
course
i
exclude
for
the
time
the
force
of
the
church
claim
of
infallibility
in
her
acts
for
which
so
much
can
be
said
but
i
do
not
exclude
the
logical
cogency
of
those
acts
considered
as
testimonies
to
the
faith
of
the
times
before
them
my
argument
then
is
this
that
from
the
first
age
of
christianity
its
teaching
looked
towards
those
ecclesiastical
dogmas
afterwards
recognized
and
defined
with
as
time
went
on
more
or
less
determinate
advance
in
the
direction
of
them
till
at
length
that
advance
became
so
pronounced
as
to
justify
their
definition
and
to
bring
it
about
and
to
place
them
in
the
position
of
rightful
interpretations
and
keys
of
the
remains
and
the
records
in
history
of
the
teaching
which
had
so
terminated
this
line
of
argument
is
not
unlike
that
which
is
considered
to
constitute
a
sufficient
proof
of
truths
in
physical
science
an
instance
of
this
is
furnished
us
in
a
work
on
mechanics
of
the
past
generation
by
a
writer
of
name
and
his
explanation
of
it
will
serve
as
an
introduction
to
our
immediate
subject
after
treating
of
the
laws
of
motion
he
goes
on
to
observe
these
laws
are
the
simplest
principles
to
which
motion
can
be
reduced
and
upon
them
the
whole
theory
depends
they
are
not
indeed
nor
do
they
admit
of
accurate
proof
by
experiment
on
account
of
the
great
nicety
required
in
adjusting
the
instruments
and
making
the
experiments
and
on
account
of
the
effects
of
friction
and
the
air
resistance
which
can
not
entirely
be
removed
they
are
however
constantly
and
invariably
suggested
to
our
senses
and
they
agree
with
experiment
as
far
as
experiment
can
go
and
the
more
accurately
the
experiments
are
made
and
the
greater
care
we
take
to
remove
all
those
impediments
which
tend
to
render
the
conclusions
erroneous
the
more
nearly
do
the
experiments
coincide
with
these
laws
and
thus
a
converging
evidence
in
favour
of
certain
doctrines
may
under
circumstances
be
as
clear
a
proof
of
their
apostolical
origin
as
can
be
reached
practically
from
the
semper
quod
ubique
quod
ab
in
such
a
method
of
proof
there
is
first
an
imperfect
secondly
a
growing
evidence
thirdly
in
consequence
a
delayed
inference
and
judgment
fourthly
reasons
producible
to
account

the

section
i
instances
cursorily
noticed
of
the
new
as
regards
the
new
testament
catholics
and
protestants
receive
the
same
books
as
canonical
and
inspired
yet
among
those
books
some
are
to
be
found
which
certainly
have
no
right
there
if
following
the
rule
of
vincentius
we
receive
nothing
as
of
divine
authority
but
what
has
been
received
always
and
everywhere
the
degrees
of
evidence
are
very
various
for
one
book
and
another
it
is
confessed
says
less
that
not
all
the
scriptures
of
our
new
testament
have
been
received
with
universal
consent
as
genuine
works
of
the
evangelists
and
apostles
but
that
man
must
have
predetermined
to
oppose
the
most
palpable
truths
and
must
reject
all
history
who
will
not
confess
that
the
part
of
the
new
testament
has
been
universally
received
as
authentic
and
that
the
remaining
books
have
been
acknowledged
as
such
by
the
of
the
ancients
for
instance
as
to
the
epistle
of
james
it
is
true
it
is
contained
in
the
old
syriac
version
in
the
second
century
but
origen
in
the
third
century
is
the
first
writer
who
distinctly
mentions
it
among
the
greeks
and
it
is
not
quoted
by
name
by
any
latin
till
the
fourth
jerome
speaks
of
its
gaining
credit
by
degrees
in
process
of
time
eusebius
says
no
more
than
that
it
had
been
up
to
his
time
acknowledged
by
the
majority
and
he
classes
it
with
the
shepherd
of
hermas
and
the
epistle
of
st
barnabas
again
the
epistle
to
the
hebrews
though
received
in
the
east
was
not
received
in
the
latin
churches
till
jerome
time
iren√¶us
either
does
not
affirm
or
denies
that
it
is
paul
tertullian
ascribes
it
to
barnabas
caius
excludes
it
from
his
list
hippolytus
does
not
receive
it
cyprian
is
silent
about
it
it
is
doubtful
whether
optatus
received
it
again
jerome
tells
us
that
in
his
day
towards
the
greek
church
rejected
the
apocalypse
but
the
latin
received
it
again
the
new
testament
consists
of
books
in
all
though
of
varying
importance
of
these
fourteen
are
not
mentioned
at
all
till
from
eighty
to
one
hundred
years
after
john
death
in
which
number
are
the
acts
the
second
to
the
corinthians
the
galatians
the
colossians
the
two
to
the
thessalonians
and
james
of
the
other
thirteen
five
viz
john
gospel
the
philippians
the
first
to
timothy
the
hebrews
and
the
first
of
john
are
quoted
but
by
one
writer
during
the
same
period
on
what
ground
then
do
we
receive
the
canon
as
it
comes
to
us
but
on
the
authority
of
the
church
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
the
church
at
that
era
decided
not
merely
bore
testimony
but
passed
a
judgment
on
former
testimony
decided
that
certain
books
were
of
authority
and
on
what
ground
did
she
so
decide
on
the
ground
that
hitherto
a
decision
had
been
impossible
in
an
age
of
persecution
from
want
of
opportunities
for
research
discussion
and
testimony
from
the
private
or
the
local
character
of
some
of
the
books
and
from
misapprehension
of
the
doctrine
contained
in
others
now
however
facilities
were
at
length
given
for
deciding
once
for
all
on
what
had
been
in
suspense
and
doubt
for
three
centuries
on
this
subject
i
will
quote
another
passage
from
the
same
tract
we
depend
upon
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
thus
as
to
scripture
former
centuries
do
not
speak
distinctly
frequently
or
unanimously
except
of
some
chief
books
as
the
gospels
but
we
see
in
them
as
we
believe
an
tendency
and
approximation
to
that
full
agreement
which
we
find
in
the
fifth
the
testimony
given
at
the
latter
date
is
the
limit
to
which
all
that
has
been
before
said
converges
for
instance
it
is
commonly
said
probat
when
we
have
reason
to
think
that
a
writer
or
an
age
would
have
witnessed
so
and
so
this
or
that
and
that
this
or
that
were
mere
accidents
of
his
position
then
he
or
it
may
be
said
to
such
testimony
in
this
way
the
first
centuries
tend
towards
the
fifth
viewing
the
matter
as
one
of
moral
evidence
we
seem
to
see
in
the
testimony
of
the
fifth
the
very
testimony
which
every
preceding
century
gave
accidents
excepted
such
as
the
present
loss
of
documents
once
extant
or
the
then
existing
misconceptions
which
want
of
intercourse
between
the
churches
occasioned
the
fifth
century
acts
as
a
comment
on
the
obscure
text
of
the
centuries
before
it
and
brings
out
a
meaning
which
with
the
help
of
the
comment
any
candid
person
sees
really
to
be
theirs
i
have
already
remarked
upon
the
historical
fact
that
the
recognition
of
original
sin
considered
as
the
consequence
of
adam
fall
was
both
as
regards
general
acceptance
and
accurate
understanding
a
gradual
process
not
completed
till
the
time
of
augustine
and
pelagius
chrysostom
lived
close
up
to
that
date
but
there
are
passages
in
his
works
often
quoted
which
we
should
not
expect
to
find
worded
as
they
stand
if
they
had
been
written
fifty
years
later
it
is
commonly
and
reasonably
said
in
explanation
that
the
fatalism
so
prevalent
in
various
shapes
pagan
and
heretical
in
the
first
centuries
was
an
obstacle
to
an
accurate
apprehension
of
the
consequences
of
the
fall
as
the
presence
of
the
existing
idolatry
was
to
the
use
of
images
if
this
be
so
we
have
here
an
instance
of
a
doctrine
held
back
for
a
time
by
circumstances
yet
in
the
event
forcing
its
way
into
its
normal
shape
and
at
length
authoritatively
fixed
in
it
that
is
of
a
doctrine
held
implicitly
then
asserting
itself
and
at
length
fully
developed
one
of
the
passages
of
chrysostom
to
which
i
might
refer
is
this
we
baptize
infants
though
they
are
not
defiled
with
sin
that
they
may
receive
sanctity
righteousness
adoption
heirship
brotherhood
with
christ
and
may
become
his
members
contr
i
this
at
least
shows
that
he
had
a
clear
view
of
the
importance
and
duty
of
infant
baptism
but
such
was
not
the
case
even
with
saints
in
the
generation
immediately
before
him
as
is
well
known
it
was
not
unusual
in
that
age
of
the
church
for
those
who
might
be
considered
catechumens
to
delay
their
baptism
as
protestants
now
delay
reception
of
the
holy
eucharist
it
is
difficult
for
us
at
this
day
to
enter
into
the
assemblage
of
motives
which
led
to
this
postponement
to
a
keen
sense
and
awe
of
the
special
privileges
of
baptism
which
could
only
once
be
received
other
reasons
would
be
added
reluctance
to
being
committed
to
a
strict
rule
of
life
and
to
making
a
public
profession
of
religion
and
to
joining
in
a
specially
intimate
fellowship
or
solidarity
with
strangers
but
so
it
was
in
matter
of
fact
for
reasons
good
or
bad
that
infant
baptism
which
is
a
fundamental
rule
of
christian
duty
with
us
was
less
earnestly
insisted
on
in
early
times
even
in
the
fourth
century
gregory
nazianzen
st
basil
and
augustine
having
christian
mothers
still
were
not
baptized
till
they
were
adults
gregory
mother
dedicated
him
to
god
immediately
on
his
birth
and
again
when
he
had
come
to
years
of
discretion
with
the
rite
of
taking
the
gospels
into
his
hands
by
way
of
consecration
he
was
from
his
youth
and
had
devoted
himself
to
a
single
life
yet
his
baptism
did
not
take
place
till
after
he
had
attended
the
schools
of
c√¶sarea
palestine
and
alexandria
and
was
on
his
voyage
to
athens
he
had
embarked
during
the
november
gales
and
for
twenty
days
his
life
was
in
danger
he
presented
himself
for
baptism
as
soon
as
he
got
to
land
st
basil
was
the
son
of
christian
confessors
on
both
father
and
mother
side
his
grandmother
macrina
who
brought
him
up
had
for
seven
years
lived
with
her
husband
in
the
woods
of
pontus
during
the
decian
persecution
his
father
was
said
to
have
wrought
miracles
his
mother
an
orphan
of
great
beauty
of
person
was
forced
from
her
unprotected
state
to
abandon
the
hope
of
a
single
life
and
was
conspicuous
in
matrimony
for
her
care
of
strangers
and
the
poor
and
for
her
offerings
to
the
churches
how
religiously
she
brought
up
her
children
is
shown
by
the
singular
blessing
that
four
out
of
ten
have
since
been
canonized
as
saints
st
basil
was
one
of
these
yet
the
child
of
such
parents
was
not
baptized
till
he
had
come
to
estate
till
according
to
the
benedictine
editor
his
and
perhaps
his
year
augustine
mother
who
is
herself
a
saint
was
a
christian
when
he
was
born
though
his
father
was
not
immediately
on
his
birth
he
was
made
a
catechumen
in
his
childhood
he
fell
ill
and
asked
for
baptism
his
mother
was
alarmed
and
was
taking
measures
for
his
reception
into
the
church
when
he
suddenly
got
better
and
it
was
deferred
he
did
not
receive
baptism
till
the
age
of
after
he
had
been
for
nine
years
a
victim
of
manich√¶an
error
in
like
manner
ambrose
though
brought
up
by
his
mother
and
holy
nuns
one
of
them
his
own
sister
marcellina
was
not
baptized
till
he
was
chosen
bishop
at
the
age
of
about
nor
his
brother
satyrus
till
about
the
same
age
after
the
serious
warning
of
a
shipwreck
jerome
too
though
educated
at
rome
and
so
far
under
religious
influences
as
with
other
boys
to
be
in
the
observance
of
sunday
and
of
devotions
in
the
catacombs
had
no
friend
to
bring
him
to
baptism
till
he
had
reached
man
estate
and
had
travelled
now
how
are
the
modern
sects
which
protest
against
infant
baptism
to
be
answered
by
anglicans
with
this
array
of
great
names
in
their
favour
by
the
later
rule
of
the
church
surely
by
the
of
some
later
saints
as
by
chrysostom
by
one
or
two
inferences
from
scripture
by
an
argument
founded
on
the
absolute
necessity
of
baptism
for
salvation
sufficient
reasons
certainly
but
impotent
to
reverse
the
fact
that
neither
in
dalmatia
nor
in
cappadocia
neither
in
rome
nor
in
africa
was
it
then
imperative
on
christian
parents
as
it
is
now
to
give
baptism
to
their
young
children
it
was
on
retrospect
and
after
the
truths
of
the
creed
had
sunk
into
the
christian
mind
that
the
authority
of
such
men
as
cyprian
chrysostom
and
augustine
brought
round
the
to
the
conclusion
which
the
infallible
church
confirmed
that
observance
of
the
rite
was
the
rule
and
the
the
exception
in
one
in
the
beginning
of
the
fifteenth
century
the
council
of
constance
pronounced
that
though
in
the
primitive
church
the
sacrament
of
the
eucharist
was
received
by
the
faithful
under
each
kind
yet
the
custom
has
been
reasonably
introduced
for
the
avoiding
of
certain
dangers
and
scandals
that
it
should
be
received
by
the
consecrators
under
each
kind
and
by
the
laity
only
under
the
kind
of
bread
since
it
is
most
firmly
to
be
believed
and
in
no
wise
doubted
that
the
whole
body
and
blood
of
christ
is
truly
contained
as
well
under
the
kind
of
bread
as
under
the
kind
of
wine
now
the
question
is
whether
the
doctrine
here
laid
down
and
carried
into
effect
in
the
usage
here
sanctioned
was
entertained
by
the
early
church
and
may
be
considered
a
just
development
of
its
principles
and
practices
i
answer
that
starting
with
the
presumption
that
the
council
has
ecclesiastical
authority
which
is
the
point
here
to
be
assumed
we
shall
find
quite
enough
for
its
defence
and
shall
be
satisfied
to
decide
in
the
affirmative
we
shall
readily
come
to
the
conclusion
that
communion
under
either
kind
is
lawful
each
kind
conveying
the
full
gift
of
the
sacrament
for
instance
scripture
affords
us
two
instances
of
what
may
reasonably
be
considered
the
administration
of
the
form
of
bread
without
that
of
wine
viz
our
lord
own
example
towards
the
two
disciples
at
emmaus
and
paul
action
at
sea
during
the
tempest
moreover
luke
speaks
of
the
first
christians
as
continuing
in
the
of
and
in
prayer
and
of
the
first
day
of
the
week
when
they
came
together
to
and
again
in
the
sixth
chapter
of
john
our
lord
says
absolutely
he
that
eateth
me
even
he
shall
live
by
me
and
though
he
distinctly
promises
that
we
shall
have
it
granted
to
us
to
drink
his
blood
as
well
as
to
eat
his
flesh
nevertheless
not
a
word
does
he
say
to
signify
that
as
he
is
the
bread
from
heaven
and
the
living
bread
so
he
is
the
heavenly
living
wine
also
again
paul
says
that
whosoever
shall
eat
this
bread
drink
this
cup
of
the
lord
unworthily
shall
be
guilty
of
the
body
and
blood
of
the
lord
many
of
the
types
of
the
holy
eucharist
as
far
as
they
go
tend
to
the
same
conclusion
as
the
manna
to
which
our
lord
referred
the
paschal
lamb
the
shewbread
the
sacrifices
from
which
the
blood
was
poured
out
and
the
miracle
of
the
loaves
which
are
figures
of
the
bread
alone
while
the
water
from
the
rock
and
the
blood
from
our
lord
side
correspond
to
the
wine
without
the
bread
others
are
representations
of
both
kinds
as
melchizedek
feast
and
elijah
miracle
of
the
meal
and
oil
and
further
it
certainly
was
the
custom
in
the
early
church
under
circumstances
to
communicate
in
one
kind
as
we
learn
from
cyprian
dionysius
st
basil
jerome
and
others
for
instance
cyprian
speaks
of
the
communion
of
an
infant
under
wine
and
of
a
woman
under
bread
and
ambrose
speaks
of
his
brother
in
shipwreck
folding
the
consecrated
bread
in
a
handkerchief
and
placing
it
round
his
neck
and
the
monks
and
hermits
in
the
desert
can
hardly
be
supposed
to
have
been
ordinarily
in
possession
of
consecrated
wine
as
well
as
bread
from
the
following
letter
of
st
basil
it
appears
that
not
only
the
monks
but
the
whole
laity
of
egypt
ordinarily
communicated
in
bread
only
he
seems
to
have
been
asked
by
his
correspondent
whether
in
time
of
persecution
it
was
lawful
in
the
absence
of
priest
or
deacon
to
take
the
communion
in
one
own
that
is
of
course
the
bread
he
answers
that
it
may
be
justified
by
the
following
parallel
cases
in
mentioning
which
he
is
altogether
silent
about
the
cup
it
is
plainly
no
fault
he
says
for
long
custom
supplies
instances
enough
to
sanction
it
for
all
the
monks
in
the
desert
where
there
is
no
priest
keep
the
communion
at
home
and
partake
it
from
themselves
in
alexandria
too
and
in
egypt
each
of
the
laity
for
the
most
part
has
the
communion
in
his
house
and
when
he
will
he
partakes
it
by
means
of
himself
for
when
once
the
priest
has
celebrated
the
sacrifice
and
given
it
he
who
takes
it
as
a
whole
together
and
then
partakes
of
it
daily
reasonably
ought
to
think
that
he
partakes
and
receives
from
him
who
has
given
it
it
should
be
added
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
letter
he
may
be
interpreted
to
speak
of
communion
in
both
kinds
and
to
say
that
it
is
good
and
profitable
here
we
have
the
usage
of
pontus
egypt
africa
and
milan
spain
may
be
added
if
a
late
author
is
right
in
his
view
of
the
meaning
of
a
spanish
canon
and
syria
as
well
as
egypt
at
least
at
a
later
date
since
nicephorus
tells
us
that
the
acephali
having
no
bishops
kept
the
bread
which
their
last
priests
had
consecrated
and
dispensed
crumbs
of
it
every
year
at
easter
for
the
purposes
of
communion
but
it
may
be
said
that
after
all
it
is
so
very
hazardous
and
fearful
a
measure
actually
to
withdraw
from
christians
of
the
sacrament
that
in
spite
of
these
precedents
some
direct
warrant
is
needed
to
reconcile
the
mind
to
it
there
might
have
been
circumstances
which
led
cyprian
or
st
basil
or
the
apostolical
christians
before
them
to
curtail
it
about
which
we
know
nothing
it
is
not
therefore
safe
in
us
because
it
was
safe
in
them
certainly
a
warrant
is
necessary
and
just
such
a
warrant
is
the
authority
of
the
church
if
we
can
trust
her
implicitly
there
is
nothing
in
the
state
of
the
evidence
to
form
an
objection
to
her
decision
in
this
instance
and
in
proportion
as
we
find
we
can
trust
her
does
our
difficulty
lessen
moreover
children
not
to
say
infants
were
at
one
time
admitted
to
the
eucharist
at
least
to
the
cup
on
what
authority
are
they
now
excluded
from
cup
and
bread
also
augustine
considered
the
usage
to
be
of
apostolical
origin
and
it
continued
in
the
west
down
to
the
twelfth
century
it
continues
in
the
east
among
greeks
and
the
various
monophysite
churches
to
this
day
and
that
on
the
ground
of
its
almost
universality
in
the
primitive
church
is
it
a
greater
innovation
to
suspend
the
cup
than
to
cut
off
children
from
communion
altogether
yet
we
acquiesce
in
the
latter
deprivation
without
a
scruple
it
is
safer
to
acquiesce
with
than
without
an
authority
safer
with
the
belief
that
the
church
is
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
truth
than
with
the
belief
that
in
so
great
a
matter
she
is
likely
to
err
the
next
instance
i
shall
take
is
from
the
early
teaching
on
the
subject
of
our
lord
consubstantiality
and
in
the
controversy
carried
on
by
various
learned
men
in
the
seventeenth
and
following
century
concerning
the
statements
of
the
early
fathers
on
this
subject
the
one
party
determined
the
patristic
theology
by
the
literal
force
of
the
separate
expressions
or
phrases
used
in
it
or
by
the
philosophical
opinions
of
the
day
the
other
by
the
doctrine
of
the
catholic
church
as
afterwards
authoritatively
declared
the
one
party
argued
that
those
fathers
have
meant
more
than
what
was
afterwards
considered
heresy
the
other
answered
that
there
is
to
their
meaning
more
thus
the
position
which
bull
maintains
seems
to
be
nothing
beyond
this
that
the
nicene
creed
is
a
natural
key
for
interpreting
the
body
of
theology
his
very
aim
is
to
explain
difficulties
now
the
notion
of
difficulties
and
their
explanation
implies
a
rule
to
which
they
are
apparent
exceptions
and
in
accordance
with
which
they
are
to
be
explained
nay
the
title
of
his
work
which
is
a
defence
of
the
creed
of
nic√¶a
shows
that
he
is
not
investigating
what
is
true
and
what
false
but
explaining
and
justifying
a
foregone
conclusion
as
sanctioned
by
the
testimony
of
the
great
council
unless
the
statements
of
the
fathers
had
suggested
difficulties
his
work
would
have
had
no
object
he
allows
that
their
language
is
not
such
as
they
would
have
used
after
the
creed
had
been
imposed
but
he
says
in
effect
that
if
we
will
but
take
it
in
our
hands
and
apply
it
equitably
to
their
writings
we
shall
bring
out
and
harmonize
their
teaching
clear
their
ambiguities
and
discover
their
anomalous
statements
to
be
few
and
insignificant
in
other
words
he
begins
with
a
presumption
and
shows
how
naturally
facts
close
round
it
and
fall
in
with
it
if
we
will
but
let
them
he
does
this
triumphantly
yet
he
has
an
arduous
work
out
of
about
thirty
writers
whom
he
reviews
he
has
for
one
cause
or
other
to
explain
piously
nearly
twenty
section
ii
our
lord
incarnation
and
the
dignity
of
his
blessed
mother
and
of
all
saints
bishop
bull
controversy
had
regard
to
writers
only
and
to
little
more
than
to
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
son
consubstantiality
and
and
as
being
controversy
it
necessarily
narrows
and
dries
up
a
large
and
fertile
subject
let
us
see
whether
treated
historically
it
will
not
present
itself
to
us
in
various
aspects
which
may
rightly
be
called
developments
as
coming
into
view
one
out
of
another
and
following
one
after
another
by
a
natural
order
of
succession
first
then
that
the
language
of
the
fathers
on
the
subject
of
our
lord
divinity
may
be
far
more
easily
accommodated
to
the
arian
hypothesis
than
can
the
language
of
the
is
agreed
on
all
hands
thus
justin
speaks
of
the
son
as
subservient
to
the
father
in
the
creation
of
the
world
as
seen
by
abraham
as
speaking
to
moses
from
the
bush
as
appearing
to
joshua
before
the
fall
of
jericho
as
minister
and
angel
and
as
numerically
distinct
from
the
father
clement
again
speaks
of
the
word
as
the
instrument
of
god
close
to
the
sole
almighty
ministering
to
the
omnipotent
will
an
energy
so
to
say
or
operation
of
the
father
and
constituted
by
his
will
as
the
cause
of
all
good
again
the
council
of
antioch
which
condemned
paul
of
samosata
says
that
he
appears
to
the
patriarchs
and
converses
with
them
being
testified
sometimes
to
be
an
angel
at
other
times
lord
at
others
god
that
while
it
is
impious
to
think
that
the
god
of
all
is
called
an
angel
the
son
is
the
angel
of
the
father
formal
proof
however
is
unnecessary
had
not
the
fact
been
as
i
have
stated
it
neither
sandius
would
have
professed
to
differ
from
the
fathers
nor
would
bull
have
had
to
defend
the
one
principal
change
which
took
place
as
time
went
on
was
the
following
the
fathers
as
in
some
of
the
foregoing
extracts
speak
of
the
angelic
visions
in
the
old
testament
as
if
they
were
appearances
of
the
son
but
augustine
introduced
the
explicit
doctrine
which
has
been
received
since
his
date
that
they
were
simply
angels
through
whom
the
omnipresent
son
manifested
himself
this
indeed
is
the
only
interpretation
which
the
statements
admitted
as
soon
as
reason
began
to
examine
what
they
did
mean
they
could
not
mean
that
the
eternal
god
could
really
be
seen
by
bodily
eyes
if
anything
was
seen
that
must
have
been
some
created
glory
or
other
symbol
by
which
it
pleased
the
almighty
to
signify
his
presence
what
was
heard
was
a
sound
as
external
to
his
essence
and
as
distinct
from
his
nature
as
the
thunder
or
the
voice
of
the
trumpet
which
pealed
along
mount
sinai
what
it
was
had
not
come
under
discussion
till
augustine
both
question
and
answer
were
alike
undeveloped
the
earlier
fathers
spoke
as
if
there
were
no
medium
interposed
between
the
creator
and
the
creature
and
so
they
seemed
to
make
the
eternal
son
the
medium
what
it
really
was
they
had
not
determined
augustine
ruled
and
his
ruling
has
been
accepted
in
later
times
that
it
was
not
a
mere
atmospheric
phenomenon
or
an
impression
on
the
senses
but
the
material
form
proper
to
an
angelic
presence
or
the
presence
of
an
angel
in
that
material
garb
in
which
blessed
spirits
do
ordinarily
appear
to
men
henceforth
the
angel
in
the
bush
the
voice
which
spoke
with
abraham
and
the
man
who
wrestled
with
jacob
were
not
regarded
as
the
son
of
god
but
as
angelic
ministers
whom
he
employed
and
through
whom
he
signified
his
presence
and
his
will
thus
the
tendency
of
the
controversy
with
the
arians
was
to
raise
our
view
of
our
mediatorial
acts
to
impress
them
on
us
in
their
divine
rather
than
their
human
aspect
and
to
associate
them
more
intimately
with
the
ineffable
glories
which
surround
the
throne
of
god
the
mediatorship
was
no
longer
regarded
in
itself
in
that
prominently
subordinate
place
which
it
had
once
occupied
in
the
thoughts
of
christians
but
as
an
office
assumed
by
one
who
though
having
become
man
in
order
to
bear
it
was
still
god
works
and
attributes
which
had
hitherto
been
assigned
to
the
economy
or
to
the
sonship
were
now
simply
assigned
to
the
manhood
a
tendency
was
also
elicited
as
the
controversy
proceeded
to
contemplate
our
lord
more
distinctly
in
his
absolute
perfections
than
in
his
relation
to
the
first
person
of
the
blessed
trinity
thus
whereas
the
nicene
creed
speaks
of
the
father
almighty
and
his
son
our
lord
god
from
god
light
from
light
very
god
from
very
god
and
of
the
holy
ghost
the
lord
and
giver
of
life
we
are
told
in
the
athanasian
of
the
father
eternal
the
son
eternal
and
the
holy
ghost
eternal
and
that
none
is
afore
or
after
other
none
is
greater
or
less
than
another
the
apollinarian
and
monophysite
controversy
which
followed
in
the
course
of
the
next
century
tended
towards
a
development
in
the
same
direction
since
the
heresies
which
were
in
question
maintained
at
least
virtually
that
our
lord
was
not
man
it
was
obvious
to
insist
on
the
passages
of
scripture
which
describe
his
created
and
subservient
nature
and
this
had
the
immediate
effect
of
interpreting
of
his
manhood
texts
which
had
hitherto
been
understood
more
commonly
of
his
divine
sonship
thus
for
instance
my
father
is
greater
than
i
which
had
been
understood
even
by
athanasius
of
our
lord
as
god
is
applied
by
later
writers
more
commonly
to
his
humanity
and
in
this
way
the
doctrine
of
his
subordination
to
the
eternal
father
which
formed
so
prominent
a
feature
in
theology
comparatively
fell
into
the
shade
and
coincident
with
these
changes
a
most
remarkable
result
is
discovered
the
catholic
polemic
in
view
of
the
arian
and
monophysite
errors
being
of
this
character
became
the
natural
introduction
to
the
for
in
proportion
as
texts
descriptive
of
created
mediation
ceased
to
belong
to
our
lord
so
was
a
room
opened
for
created
mediators
nay
as
regards
the
instance
of
angelic
appearances
itself
as
augustine
explained
them
if
those
appearances
were
creatures
certainly
creatures
were
worshipped
by
the
patriarchs
not
indeed
in
themselves
but
as
the
token
of
a
presence
greater
than
themselves
when
moses
hid
his
face
for
he
was
afraid
to
look
upon
god
he
hid
his
face
before
a
creature
when
jacob
said
i
have
seen
god
face
to
face
and
my
life
is
preserved
the
son
of
god
was
there
but
what
he
saw
what
he
wrestled
with
was
an
angel
when
joshua
fell
on
his
face
to
the
earth
and
did
worship
before
the
captain
of
the
lord
host
and
said
unto
him
what
saith
my
lord
unto
his
servant
what
was
seen
and
heard
was
a
glorified
creature
if
augustine
is
to
be
followed
and
the
son
of
god
was
in
him
and
there
were
plain
precedents
in
the
old
testament
for
the
lawfulness
of
such
adoration
when
the
people
saw
the
cloudy
pillar
stand
at
the
all
the
people
rose
up
and
worshipped
every
man
in
his
when
daniel
too
saw
a
certain
man
clothed
in
linen
there
remained
no
strength
in
him
for
his
comeliness
was
turned
in
him
into
corruption
he
fell
down
on
his
face
and
next
remained
on
his
knees
and
hands
and
at
length
stood
trembling
and
said
o
my
lord
by
the
vision
my
sorrows
are
turned
upon
me
and
i
have
retained
no
strength
for
how
can
the
servant
of
this
my
lord
talk
with
this
my
lord
it
might
be
objected
perhaps
to
this
argument
that
a
worship
which
was
allowable
in
an
elementary
system
might
be
unlawful
when
grace
and
truth
had
come
through
jesus
christ
but
then
it
might
be
retorted
surely
that
that
elementary
system
had
been
emphatically
opposed
to
all
idolatry
and
had
been
minutely
jealous
of
everything
which
might
approach
to
favouring
it
nay
the
very
prominence
given
in
the
pentateuch
to
the
doctrine
of
a
creator
and
the
comparative
silence
concerning
the
angelic
creation
and
the
prominence
given
to
the
angelic
creation
in
the
later
prophets
taken
together
were
a
token
both
of
that
jealousy
and
of
its
cessation
as
time
went
on
nor
can
anything
be
concluded
from
paul
censure
of
angel
worship
since
the
sin
which
he
is
denouncing
was
that
of
not
holding
the
head
and
of
worshipping
creatures
of
the
creator
as
the
source
of
good
the
same
explanation
avails
for
passages
like
those
in
athanasius
and
theodoret
in
which
the
worship
of
angels
is
discountenanced
the
arian
controversy
had
led
to
another
development
which
confirmed
by
anticipation
the
to
which
augustine
doctrine
pointed
in
answer
to
the
objection
urged
against
our
lord
supreme
divinity
from
texts
which
speak
of
his
exaltation
athanasius
is
led
to
insist
forcibly
on
the
benefits
which
have
accrued
to
man
through
it
he
says
that
in
truth
not
christ
but
that
human
nature
which
he
had
assumed
was
raised
and
glorified
in
him
the
more
plausible
was
the
heretical
argument
against
his
divinity
from
those
texts
the
more
emphatic
is
athanasius
exaltation
of
our
regenerate
nature
by
way
of
explaining
them
but
intimate
indeed
must
be
the
connexion
between
christ
and
his
brethren
and
high
their
glory
if
the
language
which
seemed
to
belong
to
the
incarnate
word
really
belonged
to
them
thus
the
pressure
of
the
controversy
elicited
and
developed
a
truth
which
till
then
was
held
indeed
by
christians
but
less
perfectly
realized
and
not
publicly
recognized
the
sanctification
or
rather
the
deification
of
the
nature
of
man
is
one
main
subject
of
athanasius
theology
christ
in
rising
raises
his
saints
with
him
to
the
right
hand
of
power
they
become
instinct
with
his
life
of
one
body
with
his
flesh
divine
sons
immortal
kings
gods
he
is
in
them
because
he
is
in
human
nature
and
he
communicates
to
them
that
nature
deified
by
becoming
his
that
them
it
may
deify
he
is
in
them
by
the
presence
of
his
spirit
and
in
them
he
is
seen
they
have
those
titles
of
honour
by
participation
which
are
properly
his
without
misgiving
we
may
apply
to
them
the
most
sacred
language
of
psalmists
and
prophets
thou
art
a
priest
for
ever
may
be
said
of
polycarp
or
martin
as
well
as
of
their
lord
he
hath
dispersed
abroad
he
hath
given
to
the
poor
was
fulfilled
in
laurence
i
have
found
david
my
servant
first
said
typically
of
the
king
of
israel
and
belonging
really
to
christ
is
transferred
back
again
by
grace
to
his
vicegerents
upon
earth
i
have
given
thee
the
nations
for
thine
inheritance
is
the
prerogative
of
popes
thou
hast
given
him
his
heart
desire
the
record
of
a
martyr
thou
hast
loved
righteousness
and
hated
iniquity
the
praise
of
virgins
as
christ
says
athanasius
died
and
was
exalted
as
man
so
as
man
is
he
said
to
take
what
as
god
he
ever
had
in
order
that
even
this
so
high
a
grant
of
grace
might
reach
to
us
for
the
word
did
not
suffer
loss
in
receiving
a
body
that
he
should
seek
to
receive
a
grace
but
rather
he
deified
that
which
he
put
on
nay
gave
it
graciously
to
the
race
of
man
for
it
is
the
father
glory
that
man
made
and
then
lost
should
be
found
again
and
when
done
to
death
that
he
should
be
made
alive
and
should
become
god
temple
for
whereas
the
powers
in
heaven
both
angels
and
archangels
were
ever
worshipping
the
lord
as
they
are
now
too
worshipping
him
in
the
name
of
jesus
this
is
our
grace
and
high
exaltation
that
even
when
he
became
man
the
son
of
god
is
worshipped
and
the
heavenly
powers
are
not
startled
at
seeing
all
of
us
who
are
of
one
body
with
him
introduced
into
their
realms
in
this
passage
it
is
almost
said
that
the
glorified
saints
will
partake
in
the
homage
paid
by
angels
to
christ
the
true
object
of
all
worship
and
at
least
a
reason
is
suggested
to
us
by
it
for
the
angel
shrinking
in
the
apocalypse
from
the
homage
of
john
the
theologian
and
prophet
of
the
church
but
athanasius
proceeds
still
more
explicitly
in
that
the
lord
even
when
come
in
human
body
and
called
jesus
was
worshipped
and
believed
to
be
son
and
that
through
him
the
father
is
known
it
is
plain
as
has
been
said
that
the
considered
as
the
word
received
this
so
great
grace
for
because
of
our
relationship
to
his
body
we
too
have
become
god
temple
and
in
consequence
have
been
made
sons
so
that
in
us
the
lord
is
now
and
beholders
report
as
the
apostle
says
that
is
in
them
of
a
truth
it
appears
to
be
distinctly
stated
in
this
passage
that
those
who
are
formally
recognized
as
god
adopted
sons
in
christ
are
fit
objects
of
worship
on
account
of
him
who
is
in
them
a
doctrine
which
both
interprets
and
accounts
for
the
invocation
of
saints
the
of
relics
and
the
religious
veneration
in
which
even
the
living
have
sometimes
been
held
who
being
saintly
were
distinguished
by
miraculous
gifts
worship
then
is
the
necessary
correlative
of
glory
and
in
the
same
sense
in
which
created
natures
can
share
in
the
creator
incommunicable
glory
are
they
also
allowed
a
share
of
that
worship
which
is
his
property
alone
there
was
one
other
subject
on
which
the
arian
controversy
had
a
more
intimate
though
not
an
immediate
influence
its
tendency
to
give
a
new
interpretation
to
the
texts
which
speak
of
our
lord
subordination
has
already
been
noticed
such
as
admitted
of
it
were
henceforth
explained
more
prominently
of
his
manhood
than
of
his
mediatorship
or
his
sonship
but
there
were
other
texts
which
did
not
admit
of
this
interpretation
and
which
without
ceasing
to
belong
to
him
might
seem
more
directly
applicable
to
a
creature
than
to
the
creator
he
indeed
was
really
the
wisdom
in
whom
the
father
eternally
delighted
yet
it
would
be
but
natural
if
under
the
circumstances
of
arian
misbelief
theologians
looked
out
for
other
than
the
eternal
son
to
be
the
immediate
object
of
such
descriptions
and
thus
the
controversy
opened
a
question
which
it
did
not
settle
it
discovered
a
new
sphere
if
we
may
so
speak
in
the
realms
of
light
to
which
the
church
had
not
yet
assigned
its
inhabitant
arianism
had
admitted
that
our
lord
was
both
the
god
of
the
evangelical
covenant
and
the
actual
creator
of
the
universe
but
even
this
was
not
enough
because
it
did
not
confess
him
to
be
the
one
everlasting
infinite
supreme
being
but
as
one
who
was
made
by
the
supreme
it
was
not
enough
in
accordance
with
that
heresy
to
proclaim
him
as
having
an
ineffable
origin
before
all
worlds
not
enough
to
place
him
high
above
all
creatures
as
the
type
of
all
the
works
of
hands
not
enough
to
make
him
the
king
of
all
saints
the
intercessor
for
man
with
god
the
object
of
worship
the
image
of
the
father
not
enough
because
it
was
not
all
and
between
all
and
anything
short
of
all
there
was
an
infinite
interval
the
highest
of
creatures
is
levelled
with
the
lowest
in
comparison
of
the
one
creator
himself
that
is
the
nicene
council
recognized
the
eventful
principle
that
while
we
believe
and
profess
any
being
to
be
made
of
a
created
nature
such
a
being
is
really
no
god
to
us
though
honoured
by
us
with
whatever
high
titles
and
with
whatever
homage
arius
or
asterius
did
all
but
confess
that
christ
was
the
almighty
they
said
much
more
than
bernard
or
alphonso
have
since
said
of
the
blessed
mary
yet
they
left
him
a
creature
and
were
found
wanting
thus
there
was
a
wonder
in
heaven
a
throne
was
seen
far
above
all
other
created
powers
mediatorial
intercessory
a
title
archetypal
a
crown
bright
as
the
morning
star
a
glory
issuing
from
the
eternal
throne
robes
pure
as
the
heavens
and
a
sceptre
over
all
and
who
was
the
predestined
heir
of
that
majesty
since
it
was
not
high
enough
for
the
highest
who
was
that
wisdom
and
what
was
her
name
the
mother
of
fair
love
and
fear
and
holy
hope
exalted
like
a
in
engaddi
and
a
in
jericho
created
from
the
beginning
before
the
world
in
god
everlasting
counsels
and
in
jerusalem
her
power
the
vision
is
found
in
the
apocalypse
a
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
her
feet
and
upon
her
head
a
crown
of
twelve
stars
the
votaries
of
mary
do
not
exceed
the
true
faith
unless
the
blasphemers
of
her
son
came
up
to
it
the
church
of
rome
is
not
idolatrous
unless
arianism
is
orthodoxy
i
am
not
stating
conclusions
which
were
drawn
out
in
the
controversy
but
of
premisses
which
were
laid
broad
and
deep
it
was
then
shown
it
was
then
determined
that
to
exalt
a
creature
was
no
recognition
of
its
divinity
nor
am
i
speaking
of
the
who
holding
our
derivation
from
the
substance
of
the
father
yet
denying
his
consubstantiality
really
did
lie
open
to
the
charge
of
maintaining
two
gods
and
present
no
parallel
to
the
defenders
of
the
prerogatives
of
mary
but
i
speak
of
the
arians
who
taught
that
the
son
substance
was
created
and
concerning
them
it
is
true
that
condemnation
of
their
theology
is
a
vindication
of
the
medieval
yet
it
is
not
wonderful
considering
how
socinians
sabellians
nestorians
and
the
like
abound
in
these
days
without
their
even
knowing
it
themselves
if
those
who
never
rise
higher
in
their
notions
of
our
lord
divinity
than
to
consider
him
a
man
singularly
inhabited
by
a
divine
presence
that
is
a
catholic
saint
if
such
men
should
mistake
the
honour
paid
by
the
church
to
the
human
mother
for
that
very
honour
which
and
which
alone
is
worthy
of
her
eternal
son
i
have
said
that
there
was
in
the
first
ages
no
public
and
ecclesiastical
recognition
of
the
place
which
mary
holds
in
the
economy
of
grace
this
was
reserved
for
the
fifth
century
as
the
definition
of
our
lord
proper
divinity
had
been
the
work
of
the
fourth
there
was
a
controversy
contemporary
with
those
already
mentioned
i
mean
the
nestorian
which
brought
out
the
complement
of
the
development
to
which
they
had
been
subservient
and
which
if
i
may
so
speak
supplied
the
subject
of
that
august
proposition
of
which
arianism
had
provided
the
predicate
in
order
to
do
honour
to
christ
in
order
to
defend
the
true
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
in
order
to
secure
a
right
faith
in
the
manhood
of
the
eternal
son
the
council
of
ephesus
determined
the
blessed
virgin
to
be
the
mother
of
god
thus
all
heresies
of
that
day
though
opposite
to
each
other
tended
in
a
most
wonderful
way
to
her
exaltation
and
the
school
of
antioch
the
fountain
of
primitive
rationalism
led
the
church
to
determine
first
the
conceivable
greatness
of
a
creature
and
then
the
incommunicable
dignity
of
the
blessed
virgin
but
the
spontaneous
or
traditional
feeling
of
christians
had
in
great
measure
anticipated
the
formal
ecclesiastical
decision
thus
the
title
or
mother
of
god
was
familiar
to
christians
from
primitive
times
and
had
been
used
among
other
writers
by
origen
eusebius
alexander
athanasius
ambrose
gregory
nazianzen
gregory
nyssen
and
nilus
she
had
been
called
by
others
as
by
epiphanius
jerome
and
didymus
by
others
the
mother
of
all
living
as
being
the
antitype
of
eve
for
as
epiphanius
observes
in
truth
not
in
shadow
from
mary
was
life
itself
brought
into
the
world
that
mary
might
bear
things
living
and
might
become
mother
of
living
things
augustine
says
that
all
have
sinned

the
holy
virgin

the

found
in

the

section
iii
the
papal
supremacy
i
will
take
one
instance
more
let
us
see
how
on
the
principles
which
i
have
been
laying
down
and
defending
the
evidence
lies
for
the
supremacy
as
to
this
doctrine
the
question
is
this
whether
there
was
not
from
the
first
a
certain
element
at
work
or
in
existence
divinely
sanctioned
which
for
certain
reasons
did
not
at
once
show
itself
upon
the
surface
of
ecclesiastical
affairs
and
of
which
events
in
the
fourth
century
are
the
development
and
whether
the
evidence
of
its
existence
and
operation
which
does
occur
in
the
earlier
centuries
be
it
much
or
little
is
not
just
such
as
ought
to
occur
upon
such
an
hypothesis
for
instance
it
is
true
ignatius
is
silent
in
his
epistles
on
the
subject
of
the
pope
authority
but
if
in
fact
that
authority
could
not
be
in
active
operation
then
such
silence
is
not
so
difficult
to
account
for
as
the
silence
of
seneca
or
plutarch
about
christianity
itself
or
of
lucian
about
the
roman
people
ignatius
directed
his
doctrine
according
to
the
need
while
apostles
were
on
earth
there
was
the
display
neither
of
bishop
nor
pope
their
power
had
no
prominence
as
being
exercised
by
apostles
in
course
of
time
first
the
power
of
the
bishop
displayed
itself
and
then
the
power
of
the
pope
when
the
apostles
were
taken
away
christianity
did
not
at
once
break
into
portions
yet
separate
localities
might
begin
to
be
the
scene
of
internal
dissensions
and
a
local
arbiter
in
consequence
would
be
wanted
christians
at
home
did
not
yet
quarrel
with
christians
abroad
they
quarrelled
at
home
among
themselves
ignatius
applied
the
fitting
remedy
the
was
acknowledged
on
all
hands
the
mode
of
fulfilling
and
the
means
of
securing
it
would
vary
with
the
occasion
and
the
determination
of
its
essence
its
seat
and
its
laws
would
be
a
gradual
supply
for
a
gradual
necessity
this
is
but
natural
and
is
parallel
to
instances
which
happen
daily
and
may
be
so
considered
without
prejudice
to
the
divine
right
whether
of
the
episcopate
or
of
the
papacy
it
is
a
common
occurrence
for
a
quarrel
and
a
lawsuit
to
bring
out
the
state
of
the
law
and
then
the
most
unexpected
results
often
follow
peter
prerogative
would
remain
a
mere
letter
till
the
complication
of
ecclesiastical
matters
became
the
cause
of
ascertaining
it
while
christians
were
of
one
heart
and
one
soul
it
would
be
suspended
love
dispenses
with
laws
christians
knew
that
they
must
live
in
unity
and
they
were
in
unity
in
what
that
unity
consisted
how
far
they
could
proceed
as
it
were
in
bending
it
and
what
at
length
was
the
point
at
which
it
broke
was
an
irrelevant
as
well
as
unwelcome
inquiry
relatives
often
live
together
in
happy
ignorance
of
their
respective
rights
and
properties
till
a
father
or
a
husband
dies
and
then
they
find
themselves
against
their
will
in
separate
interests
and
on
divergent
courses
and
dare
not
move
without
legal
advisers
again
the
case
is
conceivable
of
a
corporation
or
an
academical
body
going
on
for
centuries
in
the
performance
of
the
which
came
in
its
way
and
preserving
a
good
understanding
between
its
members
with
statutes
almost
a
dead
letter
and
no
precedents
to
explain
them
and
the
rights
of
its
various
classes
and
functions
undefined
then
of
its
being
suddenly
thrown
back
by
the
force
of
circumstances
upon
the
question
of
its
formal
character
as
a
body
politic
and
in
consequence
developing
in
the
relation
of
governors
and
governed
the
might
sleep
as
the
power
of
a
chancellor
has
slept
not
as
an
obsolete
for
they
never
had
been
carried
into
effect
but
as
a
mysterious
privilege
which
was
not
understood
as
an
unfulfilled
prophecy
for
ignatius
to
speak
of
popes
when
it
was
a
matter
of
bishops
would
have
been
like
sending
an
army
to
arrest
a
housebreaker
the
bishop
power
indeed
was
from
god
and
the
pope
could
be
no
more
he
as
well
as
the
pope
was
our
representative
and
had
a
sacramental
office
but
i
am
speaking
not
of
the
intrinsic
sanctity
or
divinity
of
such
an
office
but
of
its
duties
when
the
church
then
was
thrown
upon
her
own
resources
first
local
disturbances
gave
exercise
to
bishops
and
next
ecumenical
disturbances
gave
exercise
to
popes
and
whether
communion
with
the
pope
was
necessary
for
catholicity
would
not
and
could
not
be
debated
till
a
suspension
of
that
communion
had
actually
occurred
it
is
not
a
greater
difficulty
that
ignatius
does
not
write
to
the
asian
greeks
about
popes
than
that
paul
does
not
write
to
the
corinthians
about
bishops
and
it
is
a
less
difficulty
that
the
papal
supremacy
was
not
formally
acknowledged
in
the
second
century
than
that
there
was
no
formal
acknowledgment
on
the
part
of
the
church
of
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
till
the
fourth
no
doctrine
is
defined
till
it
is
violated
and
in
like
manner
it
was
natural
for
christians
to
direct
their
course
in
matters
of
doctrine
by
the
guidance
of
mere
floating
and
as
it
were
endemic
tradition
while
it
was
fresh
and
strong
but
in
proportion
as
it
languished
or
was
broken
in
particular
places
did
it
become
necessary
to
fall
back
upon
its
special
homes
first
the
apostolic
sees
and
then
the
see
of
peter
moreover
an
international
bond
and
a
common
authority
could
not
be
consolidated
were
it
ever
so
certainly
provided
while
persecutions
lasted
if
the
imperial
power
checked
the
development
of
councils
it
availed
also
for
keeping
back
the
power
of
the
papacy
the
creed
the
canon
in
like
manner
both
remained
undefined
the
creed
the
canon
the
papacy
ecumenical
councils
all
began
to
form
as
soon
as
the
empire
relaxed
its
tyrannous
oppression
of
the
church
and
as
it
was
natural
that
her
monarchical
power
should
display
itself
when
the
empire
became
christian
so
was
it
natural
also
that
further
developments
of
that
power
should
take
place
when
that
empire
fell
moreover
when
the
power
of
the
holy
see
began
to
exert
itself
disturbance
and
collision
would
be
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
temple
of
solomon
it
was
said
that
neither
hammer
nor
axe
nor
any
tool
of
iron
was
heard
in
the
house
while
it
was
in
building
this
is
a
type
of
the
church
above
it
was
otherwise
with
the
church
below
whether
in
the
instance
of
popes
or
apostles
in
either
case
a
new
power
had
to
be
defined
as
paul
had
to
plead
nay
to
strive
for
his
apostolic
authority
and
enjoined
timothy
as
bishop
of
ephesus
to
let
no
man
despise
him
so
popes
too
have
not
therefore
been
ambitious
because
they
did
not
establish
their
authority
without
a
struggle
it
was
natural
that
polycrates
should
oppose
victor
and
natural
too
that
cyprian
should
both
extol
the
see
of
peter
yet
resist
it
when
he
thought
it
went
beyond
its
province
and
at
a
later
day
it
was
natural
that
emperors
should
rise
in
indignation
against
it
and
natural
on
the
other
hand
that
it
should
take
higher
ground
with
a
younger
power
than
it
had
taken
with
an
elder
and
we
may
follow
barrow
here
without
reluctance
except
in
his
imputation
of
motives
in
the
first
times
he
says
while
the
emperors
were
pagans
their
the
popes
pretences
were
suited
to
their
condition
and
could
not
soar
high
they
were
not
then
so
mad
as
to
pretend
to
any
temporal
power
and
a
pittance
of
spiritual
eminency
did
content
them
again
the
state
of
the
most
primitive
church
did
not
well
admit
such
an
universal
sovereignty
for
that
did
consist
of
small
bodies
incoherently
situated
and
scattered
about
in
very
distant
places
and
consequently
unfit
to
be
modelled
into
one
political
society
or
to
be
governed
by
one
head
especially
considering
their
condition
under
persecution
and
poverty
what
convenient
resort
for
direction
or
justice
could
a
few
distressed
christians
in
egypt
ethiopia
parthia
india
mesopotamia
syria
armenia
cappadocia
and
other
parts
have
to
rome
again
whereas
no
point
avowed
by
christians
could
be
so
apt
to
raise
offence
and
jealousy
in
pagans
against
our
religion
as
this
which
setteth
up
a
power
of
so
vast
extent
and
huge
influence
whereas
no
novelty
could
be
more
surprising
or
startling
than
the
creation
of
an
universal
empire
over
the
consciences
and
religious
practices
of
men
whereas
also
this
doctrine
could
not
be
but
very
conspicuous
and
glaring
in
ordinary
practice
it
is
prodigious
that
all
pagans
should
not
loudly
exclaim
against
it
that
is
on
the
supposition
that
the
papal
power
really
was
then
in
actual
exercise
and
again
it
is
most
prodigious
that
in
the
disputes
managed
by
the
fathers
against
heretics
the
gnostics
valentinians
they
should
not
even
in
the
first
place
allege
and
urge
the
sentence
of
the
universal
pastor
and
judge
as
a
most
evidently
conclusive
argument
as
the
most
efficacious
and
compendious
method
of
convincing
and
silencing
them
once
more
even
popes
themselves
have
shifted
their
pretences
and
varied
in
style
according
to
the
different
circumstances
of
time
and
their
variety
of
humours
designs
interests
in
time
of
prosperity
and
upon
advantage
when
they
might
safely
do
it
any
pope
almost
would
talk
high
and
assume
much
to
himself
but
when
they
were
low
or
stood
in
fear
of
powerful
contradiction
even
the
boldest
popes
would
speak
submissively
or
moderately
on
the
whole
supposing
the
power
to
be
divinely
bestowed
yet
in
the
first
instance
more
or
less
dormant
a
history
could
not
be
traced
out
more
probable
more
suitable
to
that
hypothesis
than
the
actual
course
of
the
controversy
which
took
place
age
after
age
upon
the
papal
supremacy
it
will
be
said
that
all
this
is
a
theory
certainly
it
is
it
is
a
theory
to
account
for
facts
as
they
lie
in
the
history
to
account
for
so
much
being
told
us
about
the
papal
authority
in
early
times
and
not
more
a
theory
to
reconcile
what
is
and
what
is
not
recorded
about
it
and
which
is
the
principal
point
a
theory
to
connect
the
words
and
acts
of
the
church
with
that
antecedent
probability
of
a
monarchical
principle
in
the
divine
scheme
and
that
actual
exemplification
of
it
in
the
fourth
century
which
forms
their
presumptive
interpretation
all
depends
on
the
strength
of
that
presumption
supposing
there
be
otherwise
good
reason
for
saying
that
the
papal
supremacy
is
part
of
christianity
there
is
nothing
in
the
early
history
of
the
church
to
contradict
it
it
follows
to
inquire
in
what
this
presumption
consists
it
has
as
i
have
said
two
parts
the
antecedent
probability
of
a
popedom
and
the
actual
state
of
the
church
the
former
of
these
reasons
has
unavoidably
been
touched
upon
in
what
has
preceded
it
is
the
absolute
need
of
a
monarchical
power
in
the
church
which
is
our
ground
for
anticipating
it
a
political
body
can
not
exist
without
government
and
the
larger
is
the
body
the
more
concentrated
must
the
government
be
if
the
whole
of
christendom
is
to
form
one
kingdom
one
head
is
essential
at
least
this
is
the
experience
of
eighteen
hundred
years
as
the
church
grew
into
form
so
did
the
power
of
the
pope
develope
and
wherever
the
pope
has
been
renounced
decay
and
division
have
been
the
consequence
we
know
of
no
other
way
of
preserving
the
but
a
centre
of
unity
the
nestorians
have
had
their
catholicus
the
lutherans
of
prussia
have
their
general
superintendent
even
the
independents
i
believe
have
had
an
overseer
in
their
missions
the
anglican
church
affords
an
observable
illustration
of
this
doctrine
as
her
prospects
have
opened
and
her
communion
extended
the
see
of
canterbury
has
become
the
natural
centre
of
her
operations
it
has
at
the
present
time
jurisdiction
in
the
mediterranean
at
jerusalem
in
hindostan
in
north
america
at
the
antipodes
it
has
been
the
organ
of
communication
when
a
prime
minister
would
force
the
church
to
a
redistribution
of
her
property
or
a
protestant
sovereign
abroad
would
bring
her
into
friendly
relations
with
his
own
communion
eyes
have
been
lifted
up
thither
in
times
of
perplexity
thither
have
addresses
been
directed
and
deputations
sent
thence
issue
the
legal
decisions
or
the
declarations
in
parliament
or
the
letters
or
the
private
interpositions
which
shape
the
fortunes
of
the
church
and
are
the
moving
influence
within
her
separate
dioceses
it
must
be
so
no
church
can
do
without
its
pope
we
see
before
our
eyes
the
centralizing
process
by
which
the
see
of
peter
became
the
sovereign
head
of
christendom
if
such
be
the
nature
of
the
case
it
is
impossible
if
we
may
so
speak
reverently
that
an
infinite
wisdom
which
sees
the
end
from
the
beginning
in
decreeing
the
rise
of
an
universal
empire
should
not
have
decreed
the
development
of
a
sovereign
ruler
moreover
all
this
must
be
viewed
in
the
light
of
the
general
probability
so
much
insisted
on
above
that
doctrine
can
not
but
develope
as
time
proceeds
and
need
arises
and
that
its
developments
are
parts
of
the
divine
system
and
that
therefore
it
is
lawful
or
rather
necessary
to
interpret
the
words
and
deeds
of
the
earlier
church
by
the
determinate
teaching
of
the
later
and
on
the
other
hand
as
the
counterpart
of
these
anticipations
we
are
met
by
certain
announcements
in
scripture
more
or
less
obscure
and
needing
a
comment
and
claimed
by
the
papal
see
as
having
their
fulfilment
in
itself
such
are
the
words
thou
art
peter
and
upon
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
and
the
gates
of
hell
shall
not
prevail
against
it
and
i
will
give
unto
thee
the
keys
of
the
kingdom
of
heaven
again
feed
my
lambs
feed
my
sheep
and
satan
hath
desired
to
have
you
i
have
prayed
for
thee
and
when
thou
art
converted
strengthen
thy
brethren
such
too
are
various
other
indications
of
the
divine
purpose
as
regards
peter
too
weak
in
themselves
to
be
insisted
on
separately
but
not
without
a
confirmatory
power
such
as
his
new
name
his
walking
on
the
sea
his
miraculous
draught
of
fishes
on
two
occasions
our
lord
preaching
out
of
his
boat
and
his
appearing
first
to
him
after
his
resurrection
it
should
be
observed
moreover
that
a
similar
promise
was
made
by
the
patriarch
jacob
to
judah
thou
art
he
whom
thy
brethren
shall
praise
the
sceptre
shall
not
depart
from
judah
till
shiloh
come
yet
this
promise
was
not
fulfilled
for
perhaps
eight
hundred
years
during
which
long
period
we
hear
little
or
nothing
of
the
tribe
descended
from
him
in
like
manner
on
this
rock
i
will
build
my
church
i
give
unto
thee
the
keys
feed
my
sheep
are
not
precepts
merely
but
prophecies
and
promises
promises
to
be
accomplished
by
him
who
made
them
prophecies
to
be
fulfilled
according
to
the
need
and
to
be
interpreted
by
the
event
by
the
history
that
is
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
though
they
had
a
partial
fulfilment
even
in
the
preceding
period
and
a
still
more
noble
development
in
the
middle
ages
a
partial
fulfilment
or
at
least
indications
of
what
was
to
be
there
certainly
were
in
the
first
age
faint
one
by
one
at

they
are
various
and
are
found
in

of

with
the
roman
see
but
it
appears
he
allows
to
it
the
title
of
the
cathedra
petri
and
even
firmilian
is
a
witness
that
rome
claimed
it
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
this
title
and
its
logical
results
became
prominent
thus
julius
remonstrated
by
letter
with
the
eusebian
party
for
proceeding
on
their
own
authority
as
they
pleased
and
then
as
he
says
desiring
to
obtain
our
concurrence
in
their
decisions
though
we
never
condemned
athanasius
not
so
have
the
constitutions
of
paul
not
so
have
the
traditions
of
the
fathers
directed
this
is
another
form
of
procedure
a
novel
practice
for
what
we
have
received
from
the
blessed
apostle
peter
that
i
signify
to
you
and
i
should
not
have
written
this
as
deeming
that
these
things
are
manifest
unto
all
men
had
not
these
proceedings
so
disturbed
us
athanasius
by
preserving
this
protest
has
given
it
his
sanction
moreover
it
is
referred
to
by
socrates
and
his
account
of
it
has
the
more
force
because
he
happens
to
be
incorrect
in
the
details
and
therefore
did
not
borrow
it
from
athanasius
julius
wrote
back
he
says
that
they
acted
against
the
canons
because
they
had
not
called
him
to
the
council
the
ecclesiastical
canon
commanding
that
the
churches
ought
not
to
make
canons
beside
the
will
of
the
bishop
of
rome
and
sozomen
it
was
a
sacerdotal
law
to
declare
invalid
whatever
was
transacted
beside
the
will
of
the
bishop
of
the
romans
on
the
other
hand
the
heretics
themselves
whom
julius
withstands
are
obliged
to
acknowledge
that
rome
was
the
school
of
the
apostles
and
the
metropolis
of
orthodoxy
from
the
beginning
and
two
of
their
leaders
western
bishops
indeed
some
years
afterwards
recanted
their
heresy
before
the
pope
in
terms
of
humble
confession
another
pope
damasus
in
his
letter
addressed
to
the
eastern
bishops
against
apollinaris
calls
those
bishops
his
sons
in
that
your
charity
pays
the
due
reverence
to
the
apostolical
see
ye
profit
yourselves
the
most
most
honoured
sons
for
if
placed
as
we
are
in
that
holy
church
in
which
the
holy
apostle
sat
and
taught
how
it
becometh
us
to
direct
the
helm
to
which
we
have
succeeded
we
nevertheless
confess
ourselves
unequal
to
that
honour
yet
do
we
therefore
study
as
we
may
if
so
be
we
may
be
able
to
attain
to
the
glory
of
his
blessedness
i
speak
says
jerome
to
the
same
damasus
with
the
successor
of
the
fisherman
and
the
disciple
of
the
cross
i
following
no
one
as
my
chief
but
christ
am
associated
in
communion
with
thy
blessedness
that
is
with
the

i
know
that
on
that
rock
the

is
built
whosoever
shall
eat
the
lamb
outside
this
house
is
profane
if
a
man
be
not
in
the
ark
of

he
shall
perish
when
the
flood
comes
in
its
power
st
basil
entreats
damasus
to
send
persons
to
arbitrate
between
the
churches
of
asia
minor
or
at
least
to
make
a
report
on
the
authors
of
their
troubles
and
name
the
party
with
which
the
pope
should
hold
communion
we
are
in
no
wise
asking
anything
new
he
proceeds
but
what
was
customary
with
blessed
and
religious
men
of
former
times
and
especially
with
yourself
for
we
know
by
tradition
of
our
fathers
of
whom
we
have
inquired
and
from
the
information
of
writings
still
preserved
among
us
that
dionysius
that
most
blessed
bishop
while
he
was
eminent
among
you
for
orthodoxy
and
other
virtues
sent
letters
of
visitation
to
our
church
at
c√¶sarea
and
of
consolation
to
our
fathers
with
ransomers
of
our
brethren
from
captivity
in
like
manner
ambrosiaster
a
pelagian
in
his
doctrine
which
here
is
not
to
the
purpose
speaks
of
the
church
being
god
house
whose
ruler
at
this
time
is
damasus
we
bear
says
siricius
another
pope
the
burden
of
all
who
are
laden
yea
rather
the
blessed
apostle
peter
beareth
them
in
us
who
as
we
trust
in
all
things
protects
and
defends
us
the
heirs
of
his
government
and
he
in
turn
is
confirmed
by
optatus
you
can
not
deny
your
knowledge
says
the
latter
to
parmenian
the
donatist
that
in
the
city
rome
on
peter
first
hath
an
episcopal
see
been
conferred
in
which
peter
sat
the
head
of
all
the
apostles
in
which
one
see
unity
might
be
preserved
by
all
lest
the
other
apostles
should
support
their
respective
sees
in
order
that
he
might
be
at
once
a
schismatic
and
a
sinner
who
against
that
one
see
placed
a
second
therefore
that
one
see
which
is
the
first
of
the
church
prerogatives
peter
filled
first
to
whom
succeeded
linus
to
linus
clement
to
clement
to
damasus
siricius
who
at
this
day
is
associated
with
us
together
with
whom
the
whole
world
is
in
accordance
with
us
in
the
one
bond
of
communion
by
the
intercourse
of
letters
of
peace
another
pope
diligently
and
congruously
do
ye
consult
the
of
the
apostolical
dignity
says
innocent
to
the
council
of
milevis
the
dignity
of
him
on
whom
beside
those
things
which
are
without
falls
the
care
of
all
the
churches
following
the
form
of
the
ancient
rule
which
you
know
as
well
as
i
has
been
preserved
always
by
the
whole
world
here
the
pope
appeals
as
it
were
to
the
rule
of
vincentius
while
augustine
bears
witness
that
he
did
not
outstep
his
prerogative
for
giving
an
account
of
this
and
another
letter
he
says
he
the
pope
answered
us
as
to
all
these
matters
as
it
was
religious
and
becoming
in
the
bishop
of
the
apostolic
see
another
pope
we
have
especial
anxiety
about
all
persons
says
celestine
to
the
illyrian
bishops
on
whom
in
the
holy
apostle
peter
christ
conferred
the
necessity
of
making
all
men
our
care
when
he
gave
him
the
keys
of
opening
and
shutting
and
prosper
his
contemporary
confirms
him
when
he
calls
rome
the
seat
of
peter
which
being
made
to
the
world
the
head
of
pastoral
honour
possesses
by
religion
what
it
does
not
possess
by
arms
and
vincent
of
lerins
when
he
calls
the
pope
the
head
of
the
world
another
pope
blessed
peter
says
leo
hath
not
deserted
the
helm
of
the
church
which
he
had
assumed
his
power
lives
and
his
authority
is
in
his
see
that
immoveableness
which
from
the
rock
christ
he
when
made
a
rock
received
has
been
communicated
also
to
his
heirs
and
as
athanasius
and
the
eusebians
by
their
contemporary
testimonies
confirm
julius
and
jerome
st
basil
and
ambrosiaster
damasus
and
optatus
siricius
and
augustine
innocent
and
prosper
and
vincent
celestine
so
do
peter
chrysologus
and
the
council
of
chalcedon
confirm
leo
blessed
peter
says
chrysologus
who
lives
and
presides
in
his
own
see
supplies
truth
of
faith
to
those
who
seek
it
and
the
ecumenical
council
of
chalcedon
addressing
leo
respecting
dioscorus
bishop
of
alexandria
he
extends
his
madness
even
against
him
to
whom
the
custody
of
the
vineyard
has
been
committed
by
the
saviour
that
is
against
thy
apostolical
holiness
but
the
instance
of
leo
will
occur
again
in
a
later
chapter
the
acts
of
the
fourth
century
speak
as
strongly
as
its
words
we
may
content
ourselves
here
with
barrow
admissions
the
pope
power
he
says
was
much
amplified
by
the
importunity
of
persons
condemned
or
extruded
from
their
places
whether
upon
just
accounts
or
wrongfully
and
by
faction
for
they
finding
no
other
more
hopeful
place
of
refuge
and
redress
did
often
apply
to
him
for
what
will
not
men
do
whither
will
not
they
go
in
straits
thus
did
marcion
go
to
rome
and
sue
for
admission
to
communion
there
so
fortunatus
and
felicissimus
in
cyprian
being
condemned
in
afric
did
fly
to
rome
for
shelter
of
which
absurdity
cyprian
doth
so
complain
so
likewise
martianus
and
basilides
in
cyprian
being
outed
of
their
sees
for
having
lapsed
from
the
christian
profession
did
fly
to
stephen
for
succour
to
be
restored
so
maximus
the
cynic
went
to
rome
to
get
a
confirmation
of
his
election
at
constantinople
so
marcellus
being
rejected
for
heterodoxy
went
thither
to
get
attestation
to
his
orthodoxy
of
which
st
basil
complaineth
so
apiarus
being
condemned
in
afric
for
his
crimes
did
appeal
to
rome
and
on
the
other
side
athanasius
being
with
great
partiality
condemned
by
the
synod
of
tyre
paulus
and
other
bishops
being
extruded
from
their
sees
for
orthodoxy
chrysostom
being
condemned
and
expelled
by
theophilus
and
his
complices
flavianus
being
deposed
by
dioscorus
and
the
ephesine
synod
theodoret
being
condemned
by
the
same
did
cry
out
for
help
to
rome
chelidonius
bishop
of
besan√ßon
being
deposed
by
hilarius
of
arles
for
crime
did
fly
to
pope
leo
again
our
adversaries
do
oppose
some
instances
of
popes
meddling
in
the
constitution
of
bishops
as
pope
leo
saith
that
anatolius
did
the
favour
of
his
assent
obtain
the
bishopric
of
constantinople
the
same
pope
is
alleged
as
having
confirmed
maximus
of
antioch
the
same
doth
write
to
the
bishop
of
thessalonica
his
vicar
that
he
should
the
elections
of
bishops
by
his
authority
he
also
confirmed
donatus
an
african
bishop
will
that
donatus
preside
over
the
lord
flock
upon
condition
that
he
remember
to
send
us
an
account
of
his
faith
pope
damasus
did
confirm
the
ordination
of
peter
alexandrinus
and
again
the
popes
indeed
in
the
fourth
century
began
to
practise
a
fine
trick
very
serviceable
to
the
enlargement
of
their
power
which
was
to
confer
on
certain
bishops
as
occasion
served
or
for
continuance
the
title
of
their
vicar
or
lieutenant
thereby
pretending
to
impart
authority
to
them
whereby
they
were
enabled
for
performance
of
divers
things
which
otherwise
by
their
own
episcopal
or
metropolitical
power
they
could
not
perform
by
which
device
they
did
engage
such
bishops
to
such
a
dependence
on
them
whereby
they
did
promote
the
papal
authority
in
provinces
to
the
oppression
of
the
ancient
rights
and
liberties
of
bishops
and
synods
doing
what
they
pleased
under
pretence
of
this
vast
power
communicated
to
them
and
for
fear
of
being
displaced
or
out
of
affection
to
their
favourer
doing
what
might
serve
to
advance
the
papacy
thus
did
pope
celestine
constitute
cyril
in
his
room
pope
leo
appointed
anatolius
of
constantinople
pope
felix
acacius
of
constantinople
pope
simplicius
to
zeno
bishop
of
seville
thought
it
convenient
that
you
should
be
held
up
by
the
vicariat
authority
of
our
see
so
did
siricius
and
his
successors
constitute
the
bishops
of
thessalonica
to
be
their
vicars
in
the
diocese
of
illyricum
wherein
being
then
a
member
of
the
western
empire
they
had
caught
a
special
jurisdiction
to
which
pope
leo
did
refer
in
those
words
which
sometimes
are
impertinently
alleged
with
reference
to
all
bishops
but
concern
only
anastasius
bishop
of
thessalonica
have
entrusted
thy
charity
to
be
in
our
stead
so
that
thou
art
called
into
part
of
the
solicitude
not
into
plenitude
of
the
authority
so
did
pope
zosimus
bestow
a
like
pretence
of
vicarious
power
upon
the
bishop
of
arles
which
city
was
the
seat
of
the
temporal
exarch
in
gaul
more
ample
testimony
for
the
papal
supremacy
as
now
professed
by
roman
catholics
is
scarcely
necessary
than
what
is
contained
in
these
passages
the
simple
question
is
whether
the
clear
light
of
the
fourth
and

may
be

that

from

as
now
held
is
logically
as
well
as
historically
the
representative
of
the
ancient
faith
this
then
is
the
subject
to
which
i
have
as
yet
addressed
myself
and
i
have
maintained
that
modern
catholicism
is
nothing
else
but
simply
the
legitimate
growth
and
complement
that
is
the
natural
and
necessary
development
of
the
doctrine
of
the
early
church
and
that
its
divine
authority
is
included
in
the
divinity
of
christianity
so
far
i
have
gone
but
an
important
objection
presents
itself
for
distinct
consideration
it
may
be
said
in
answer
to
me
that
it
is
not
enough
that
a
certain
large
system
of
doctrine
such
as
that
which
goes
by
the
name
of
catholic
should
admit
of
being
referred
to
beliefs
opinions
and
usages
which
prevailed
among
the
first
christians
in
order
to
my
having
a
logical
right
to
include
a
reception
of
the
later
teaching
in
the
reception
of
the
earlier
that
an
intellectual
development
may
be
in
one
sense
natural
and
yet
untrue
to
its
original
as
diseases
come
of
nature
yet
are
the
destruction
or
rather
the
negation
of
health
that
the
causes
which
stimulate
the
growth
of
ideas
may
also
disturb
and
deform
them
and
that
christianity
might
indeed
have
been
intended
by
its
divine
author
for
a
wide
expansion
of
the
ideas
proper
to
it
and
yet
this
great
benefit
hindered
by
the
evil
birth
of
cognate
errors
which
acted
as
its
counterfeit
in
a
word
that
what
i
have
called
developments
in
the
roman
church
are
nothing
more
or
less
than
what
used
to
be
called
her
corruptions
and
that
new
names
do
not
destroy
old
grievances
this
is
what
may
be
said
and
i
acknowledge
its
force
it
becomes
necessary
in
consequence
to
assign
certain
characteristics
of
faithful
developments
which
none
but
faithful
developments
have
and
the
presence
of
which
serves
as
a
test
to
discriminate
between
them
and
corruptions
this
i
at
once
proceed
to
do
and
i
shall
begin
by
determining
what
a
corruption
is
and
why
it
can
not
rightly
be
called
and
how
it
differs
from
a
development
to
find
then
what
a
corruption
or
perversion
of
the
truth
is
let
us
inquire
what
the
word
means
when
used
literally
of
material
substances
now
it
is
plain
first
of
all
that
a
corruption
is
a
word
attaching
to
organized
matters
only
a
stone
may
be
crushed
to
powder
but
it
can
not
be
corrupted
corruption
on
the
contrary
is
the
breaking
up
of
life
preparatory
to
its
termination
this
resolution
of
a
body
into
its
component
parts
is
the
stage
before
its
dissolution
it
begins
when
life
has
reached
its
perfection
and
it
is
the
sequel
or
rather
the
continuation
of
that
process
towards
perfection
being
at
the
same
time
the
reversal
and
undoing
of
what
went
before
till
this
point
of
regression
is
reached
the
body
has
a
function
of
its
own
and
a
direction
and
aim
in
its
action
and
a
nature
with
laws
these
it
is
now
losing
and
the
traits
and
tokens
of
former
years
and
with
them
its
vigour
and
powers
of
nutrition
of
assimilation
and
of
taking
this
analogy
as
a
guide
i
venture
to
set
down
seven
notes
of
varying
cogency
independence
and
applicability
to
discriminate
healthy
developments
of
an
idea
from
its
state
of
corruption
and
decay
as
follows
there
is
no
corruption
if
it
retains
one
and
the
same
type
the
same
principles
the
same
organization
if
its
beginnings
anticipate
its
subsequent
phases
and
its
later
phenomena
protect
and
subserve
its
earlier
if
it
has
a
power
of
assimilation
and
revival
and
a
vigorous
action
from
first
to
last
on
these
tests
i
shall
now
enlarge
nearly
in
the
order
in
which
i
have
enumerated
them
section
i
first
note
of
a
genuine
development
preservation
of
type
this
is
readily
suggested
by
the
analogy
of
physical
growth
which
is
such
that
the
parts
and
proportions
of
the
developed
form
however
altered
correspond
to
those
which
belong
to
its
rudiments
the
adult
animal
has
the
same
make
as
it
had
on
its
birth
young
birds
do
not
grow
into
fishes
nor
does
the
child
degenerate
into
the
brute
wild
or
domestic
of
which
he
is
by
inheritance
lord
vincentius
of
lerins
adopts
this
illustration
in
distinct
reference
to
christian
doctrine
let
the
soul
religion
he
says
imitate
the
law
of
the
body
which
as
years
go
on
developes
indeed
and
opens
out
its
due
proportions
and
yet
remains
identically
what
it
was
small
are
a
baby
limbs
a
are
larger
yet
they
are
the
same
in
like
manner
every
calling
or
office
has
its
own
type
which
those
who
fill
it
are
bound
to
maintain
and
to
deviate
from
the
type
in
any
material
point
is
to
relinquish
the
calling
thus
both
chaucer
and
goldsmith
have
drawn
pictures
of
a
true
parish
priest
these
differ
in
details
but
on
the
whole
they
agree
together
and
are
one
in
such
sense
that
sensuality
or
ambition
must
be
considered
a
forfeiture
of
that
high
title
those
magistrates
again
are
called
corrupt
who
are
guided
in
their
judgments
by
love
of
lucre
or
respect
of
persons
for
the
administration
of
justice
is
their
essential
function
thus
collegiate
or
monastic
bodies
lose
their
claim
to
their
endowments
or
their
buildings
as
being
relaxed
and
degenerate
if
they
neglect
their
statutes
or
their
rule
thus
too
in
political
history
a
mayor
of
the
palace
such
as
he
became
in
the
person
of
pepin
was
no
faithful
development
of
the
office
he
filled
as
originally
intended
and
established
in
like
manner
it
has
been
argued
by
a
late
writer
whether
fairly
or
not
does
not
interfere
with
the
illustration
that
the
miraculous
vision
and
dream
of
the
labarum
could
not
have
really
taken
place
as
reported
by
eusebius
because
it
is
counter
to
the
original
type
of
christianity
for
the
first
time
he
says
on
occasion
of
constantine
introduction
of
the
standard
into
his
armies
the
meek
and
peaceful
jesus
became
a
god
of
battle
and
the
cross
the
holy
sign
of
christian
redemption
a
banner
of
bloody
strife
this
was
the
first
advance
to
the
military
christianity
of
the
middle
ages
a
modification
of
the
pure
religion
of
the
gospel
if
directly
opposed
to
its
genuine
principles
still
apparently
indispensable
to
the
social
progress
of
men
on
the
other
hand
a
popular
leader
may
go
through
a
variety
of
professions
he
may
court
parties
and
break
with
them
he
may
contradict
himself
in
words
and
undo
his
own
measures
yet
there
may
be
a
steady
fulfilment
of
certain
objects
or
adherence
to
certain
plain
doctrines
which
gives
a
unity
to
his
career
and
impresses
on
beholders
an
image
of
directness
and
large
consistency
which
shows
a
fidelity
to
his
type
from
first
to
last
however
as
the
last
instances
suggest
to
us
this
unity
of
type
characteristic
as
it
is
of
faithful
developments
must
not
be
pressed
to
the
extent
of
denying
all
variation
nay
considerable
alteration
of
proportion
and
relation
as
time
goes
on
in
the
parts
or
aspects
of
an
idea
great
changes
in
outward
appearance
and
internal
harmony
occur
in
the
instance
of
the
animal
creation
itself
the
fledged
bird
differs
much
from
its
rudimental
form
in
the
egg
the
butterfly
is
the
development
but
not
in
any
sense
the
image
of
the
grub
the
whale
claims
a
place
among
mammalia
though
we
might
fancy
that
as
in
the
child
game
of
catscradle
some
strange
introsusception
had
been
permitted
to
make
it
so
like
yet
so
contrary
to
the
animals
with
which
it
is
itself
classed
and
in
like
manner
if
beasts
of
prey
were
once
in
paradise
and
fed
upon
grass
they
must
have
presented
bodily
phenomena
very
different
from
the
structure
of
muscles
claws
teeth
and
viscera
which
now
fit
them
for
a
carnivorous
existence
eutychius
patriarch
of
constantinople
on
his
grasped
his
own
hand
and
said
i
confess
that
in
this
flesh
we
shall
all
rise
again
yet
flesh
and
blood
can
not
inherit
the
kingdom
of
god
and
a
glorified
body
has
attributes
incompatible
with
its
present
condition
on
earth
more
subtle
still
and
mysterious
are
the
variations
which
are
consistent
or
not
inconsistent
with
identity
in
political
and
religious
developments
the
catholic
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
has
ever
been
accused
by
heretics
of
interfering
with
that
of
the
divine
unity
out
of
which
it
grew
and
even
believers
will
at
first
sight
consider
that
it
tends
to
obscure
it
yet
petavius
says
i
will
affirm
what
perhaps
will
surprise
the
reader
that
that
distinction
of
persons
which
in
regard
to
is
in
reality
most
great
is
so
far
from
disparaging
the
unity
and
simplicity
of
god
that
this
very
real
distinction
especially
avails
for
the
doctrine
that
god
is
one
and
most
simple
again
arius
asserted
that
the
second
person
of
the
blessed
trinity
was
not
able
to
comprehend
the
first
whereas
eunomius
characteristic
tenet
was
in
an
opposite
direction
that
not
only
the
son
but
that
all
men
could
comprehend
god
yet
no
one
can
doubt
that
eunomianism
was
a
true
development
not
a
corruption
of
arianism
the
same
man
may
run
through
various
philosophies
or
beliefs
which
are
in
themselves
irreconcilable
without
inconsistency
since
in
him
they
may
be
nothing
more
than
accidental
instruments
or
expressions
of
what
he
is
inwardly
from
first
to
last
the
political
doctrines
of
the
modern
tory
resemble
those
of
the
primitive
whig
yet
few
will
deny
that
the
whig
and
tory
characters
have
each
a
discriminating
type
calvinism
has
changed
into
unitarianism
yet
this
need
not
be
called
a
corruption
even
if
it
be
not
strictly
speaking
a
development
for
harding
in
controversy
with
jewell
surmised
the
coming
change
three
centuries
since
and
it
has
occurred
not
in
one
country
but
in
many
the
history
of
national
character
supplies
an
analogy
rather
than
an
instance
strictly
in
point
yet
there
is
so
close
a
connexion
between
the
development
of
minds
and
of
ideas
that
it
is
allowable
to
refer
to
it
here
thus
we
find
england
of
old
the
most
loyal
supporter
and
england
of
late
the
most
jealous
enemy
of
the
holy
see
as
great
a
change
is
exhibited
in
france
once
the
eldest
born
of
the
church
and
the
flower
of
her
knighthood
now
democratic
and
lately
infidel
yet
in
neither
nation
can
these
great
changes
be
well
called
corruptions
or
again
let
us
reflect
on
the
ethical
vicissitudes
of
the
chosen
people
how
different
is
their
grovelling
and
cowardly
temper
on
leaving
egypt
from
the
chivalrous
spirit
as
it
may
be
called
of
the
age
of
david
or
again
from
the
bloody
fanaticism
which
braved
titus
and
hadrian
in
what
contrast
is
that
impotence
of
mind
which
gave
way
at
once
and
bowed
the
knee
at
the
very
sight
of
a
pagan
idol
with
the
stern
iconoclasm
and
bigoted
nationality
of
later
judaism
how
startling
the
apparent
absence
of
what
would
be
called
talent
in
this
people
during
their
supernatural
dispensation
compared
with
the
gifts
of
mind
which
various
witnesses
assign
to
them
now
and
in
like
manner
ideas
may
remain
when
the
expression
of
them
is
indefinitely
varied
and
we
can
not
determine
whether
a
professed
development
is
truly
such
or
not
without
further
knowledge
than
an
experience
of
the
mere
fact
of
this
variation
nor
will
our
instinctive
feelings
serve
as
a
criterion
it
must
have
been
an
extreme
shock
to
peter
to
be
told
he
must
slay
and
eat
beasts
unclean
as
well
as
clean
though
such
a
command
was
implied
already
in
that
faith
which
he
held
and
taught
a
shock
which
a
single
effort
or
a
short
period
or
the
force
of
reason
would
not
suffice
to
overcome
nay
it
may
happen
that
a
representation
which
varies
from
its
original
may
be
felt
as
more
true
and
faithful
than
one
which
has
more
pretensions
to
be
exact
so
it
is
with
many
a
portrait
which
is
not
striking
at
first
look
of
course
it
disappoints
us
but
when
we
are
familiar
with
it
we
see
in
it
what
we
could
not
see
at
first
and
prefer
it
not
to
a
perfect
likeness
but
to
many
a
sketch
which
is
so
precise
as
to
be
a
caricature
on
the
other
hand
real
perversions
and
corruptions
are
often
not
so
unlike
externally
to
the
doctrine
from
which
they
come
as
are
changes
which
are
consistent
with
it
and
true
developments
when
rome
changed
from
a
republic
to
an
empire
it
was
a
real
alteration
of
polity
or
what
may
be
called
a
corruption
yet
in
appearance
the
change
was
small
the
old
offices
or
functions
of
government
remained
it
was
only
that
the
imperator
or
commander
in
chief
concentrated
them
in
his
own
person
augustus
was
consul
and
tribune
supreme
pontiff
and
censor
and
the
imperial
rule
was
in
the
words
of
gibbon
an
absolute
monarchy
disguised
by
the
forms
of
a
commonwealth
on
the
other
hand
when
the
dissimulation
of
augustus
was
exchanged
for
the
ostentation
of
dioclesian
the
real
alteration
of
constitution
was
trivial
but
the
appearance
of
change
was
great
instead
of
plain
consul
censor
and
tribune
dioclesian
became
dominus
or
king
assumed
the
diadem
and
threw
around
him
the
forms
of
a
court
nay
one
cause
of
corruption
in
religion
is
the
refusal
to
follow
the
course
of
doctrine
as
it
moves
on
and
an
obstinacy
in
the
notions
of
the
past
certainly
as
we
see
conspicuously
in
the
history
of
the
chosen
race
the
samaritans
who
refused
to
add
the
prophets
to
the
law
and
the
sadducees
who
denied
a
truth
which
was
covertly
taught
in
the
book
of
exodus
were
in
appearance
only
faithful
adherents
to
the
primitive
doctrine
our
lord
found
his
people
precisians
in
their
obedience
to
the
letter
he
condemned
them
for
not
being
led
on
to
its
spirit
that
is
to
its
developments
the
gospel
is
the
development
of
the
law
yet
what
difference
seems
wider
than
that
which
separates
the
unbending
rule
of
moses
from
the
grace
and
truth
which
came
by
jesus
christ
samuel
had
of
old
time
fancied
that
the
tall
eliab
was
the
lord
anointed
and
jesse
had
thought
david
only
fit
for
the
sheepcote
and
when
the
great
king
came
he
was
as
a
root
out
of
a
dry
ground
but
strength
came
out
of
weakness
and
out
of
the
strong
sweetness
so
it
is
in
the
case
of
our
friends
the
most
obsequious
are
not
always
the
truest
and
seeming
cruelty
is
often
genuine
affection
we
know
the
conduct
of
the
three
daughters
in
the
drama
towards
the
old
king
she
who
had
found
her
love
more
richer
than
her
tongue
and
could
not
heave
her
heart
into
her
mouth
was
in
the
event
alone
true
to
her
father
an
idea
then
does
not
always
bear
about
it
the
same
external
image
this
circumstance
however
has
no
force
to
weaken
the
argument
for
its
substantial
identity
as
drawn
from
its
external
sameness
when
such
sameness
remains
on
the
contrary
for
that
very
reason
of
becomes
so
much
the
surer
guarantee
of
the
healthiness
and
soundness
of
developments
when
it
is
persistently
preserved
in
spite
of
their
number

importance

responsibility
is
a
principle
the
being
of
a
god
is
a
doctrine
from
that
doctrine
all
theology
has
come
in
due
course
whereas
that
principle
is
not
clearer
under
the
gospel
than
in
paradise
and
depends
not
on
belief
in
an
almighty
governor
but
on
conscience
yet
the
difference
between
the
two
sometimes
merely
exists
in
our
mode
of
viewing
them
and
what
is
a
doctrine
in
one
philosophy
is
a
principle
in
another
personal
responsibility
may
be
made
a
doctrinal
basis
and
develope
into
arminianism
or
pelagianism
again
it
may
be
discussed
whether
infallibility
is
a
principle
or
a
doctrine
of
the
church
of
rome
and
dogmatism
a
principle
or
doctrine
of
christianity
again
consideration
for
the
poor
is
a
doctrine
of
the
church
considered
as
a
religious
body
and
a
principle
when
she
is
viewed
as
a
political
power
doctrines
stand
to
principles
as
the
definitions
to
the
axioms
and
postulates
of
mathematics
thus
the
and
propositions
of
euclid
book
are
developments
not
of
the
three
first
axioms
which
are
required
in
the
proof
but
of
the
definition
of
a
right
angle
perhaps
the
perplexity
which
arises
in
the
mind
of
a
beginner
on
learning
the
early
propositions
of
the
second
book
arises
from
these
being
more
prominently
exemplifications
of
axioms
than
developments
of
definitions
he
looks
for
developments
from
the
definition
of
the
rectangle
and
finds
but
various
particular
cases
of
the
general
truth
that
the
whole
is
equal
to
its
parts
it
might
be
expected
that
the
catholic
principles
would
be
later
in
development
than
the
catholic
doctrines
inasmuch
as
they
lie
deeper
in
the
mind
and
are
assumptions
rather
than
objective
professions
this
has
been
the
case
the
protestant
controversy
has
mainly
turned
or
is
turning
on
one
or
other
of
the
principles
of
catholicity
and
to
this
day
the
rule
of
scripture
interpretation
the
doctrine
of
inspiration
the
relation
of
faith
to
reason
moral
responsibility
private
judgment
inherent
grace
the
seat
of
infallibility
remain
i
suppose
more
or
less
undeveloped
or
at
least
undefined
by
the
church
doctrines
stand
to
principles
if
it
may
be
said
without
fancifulness
as
fecundity
viewed
relatively
to
generation
though
this
analogy
must
not
be
strained
doctrines
are
developed
by
the
operation
of
principles
and
develope
variously
according
to
those
principles
thus
a
belief
in
the
transitiveness
of
worldly
goods
leads
the
epicurean
to
enjoyment
and
the
ascetic
to
mortification
and
from
their
common
doctrine
of
the
sinfulness
of
matter
the
alexandrian
gnostics
became
sensualists
and
the
syrian
devotees
the
same
philosophical
elements
received
into
a
certain
sensibility
or
insensibility
to
sin
and
its
consequences
leads
one
mind
to
the
church
of
rome
another
to
what
for
want
of
a
better
word
may
be
called
germanism
again
religious
investigation
sometimes
is
conducted
on
the
principle
that
it
is
a
duty
to
follow
and
speak
the
truth
which
really
means
that
it
is
no
duty
to
fear
error
or
to
consider
what
is
safest
or
to
shrink
from
scattering
doubts
or
to
regard
the
responsibility
of
misleading
and
thus
it
terminates
in
heresy
or
infidelity
without
any
blame
to
religious
investigation
in
itself
again
to
take
a
different
subject
what
constitutes
a
chief
interest
of
dramatic
compositions
and
tales
is
to
use
external
circumstances
which
may
be
considered
their
law
of
development
as
a
means
of
bringing
out
into
different
shapes
and
showing
under
new
aspects
the
personal
peculiarities
of
character
according
as
either
those
circumstances
or
those
peculiarities
vary
in
the
case
of
the
personages
introduced
principles
are
popularly
said
to
develope
when
they
are
but
exemplified
thus
the
various
sects
of
protestantism
unconnected
as
they
are
with
each
other
are
called
developments
of
the
principle
of
private
judgment
of
which
really
they
are
but
applications
and
results
a
development
to
be
faithful
must
retain
both
the
doctrine
and
the
principle
with
which
it
started
doctrine
without
its
correspondent
principle
remains
barren
if
not
lifeless
of
which
the
greek
church
seems
an
instance
or
it
forms
those
hollow
professions
which
are
familiarly
called
shams
as
a
zeal
for
an
established
church
and
its
creed
on
merely
conservative
or
temporal
motives
such
too
was
the
roman
constitution
between
the
reigns
of
augustus
and
dioclesian
on
the
other
hand
principle
without
its
corresponding
doctrine
may
be
considered
as
the
state
of
religious
minds
in
the
heathen
world
viewed
relatively
to
revelation
that
is
of
the
children
of
god
who
are
scattered
abroad
pagans
may
have
heretics
can
not
have
the
same
principles
as
catholics
if
the
latter
have
the
same
they
are
not
real
heretics
but
in
ignorance
principle
is
a
better
test
of
heresy
than
doctrine
heretics
are
true
to
their
principles
but
change
to
and
fro
backwards
and
forwards
in
opinion
for
very
opposite
doctrines
may
be
exemplifications
of
the
same
principle
thus
the
antiochenes
and
other
heretics
sometimes
were
arians
sometimes
sabellians
sometimes
nestorians
sometimes
monophysites
as
if
at
random
from
fidelity
to
their
common
principle
that
there
is
no
mystery
in
theology
thus
calvinists
become
unitarians
from
the
principle
of
private
judgment
the
doctrines
of
heresy
are
accidents
and
soon
run
to
an
end
its
principles
are
everlasting
this
too
is
often
the
solution
of
the
paradox
extremes
meet
and
of
the
startling
reactions
which
take
place
in
individuals
the
presence
of
some
one
principle
or
condition
which
is
dominant
in
their
minds
from
first
to
last
if
one
of
two
contradictory
alternatives
be
necessarily
true
on
a
certain
hypothesis
then
the
denial
of
the
one
leads
by
mere
logical
consistency
and
without
direct
reasons
to
a
reception
of
the
other
thus
the
question
between
the
church
of
rome
and
protestantism
falls
in
some
minds
into
the
proposition
rome
is
either
the
pillar
and
ground
of
the
truth
or
she
is
antichrist
in
proportion
then
as
they
revolt
from
considering
her
the
latter
are
they
compelled
to
receive
her
as
the
former
hence
too
men
may
pass
from
infidelity
to
rome
and
from
rome
to
infidelity
from
a
conviction
in
both
courses
that
there
is
no
tangible
intellectual
position
between
the
two
protestantism
viewed
in
its
more
catholic
aspect
is
doctrine
without
active
principle
viewed
in
its
heretical
it
is
active
principle
without
doctrine
many
of
its
speakers
for
instance
use
eloquent
and
glowing
language
about
the
church
and
its
characteristics
some
of
them
do
not
realize
what
they
say
but
use
high
words
and
general
statements
about
the
faith
and
primitive
truth
and
schism
and
heresy
to
which
they
attach
no
definite
meaning
while
others
speak
of
unity
universality
and
catholicity
and
use
the
words
in
their
own
sense
and
for
their
own
ideas
the
science
of
grammar
affords
another
instance
of
the
existence
of
special
laws
in
the
formation
of
systems
some
languages
have
more
elasticity
than
others
and
greater
capabilities
and
the
difficulty
of
explaining
the
fact
can
not
lead
us
to
doubt
it
there
are
languages
for
instance
which
have
a
capacity
for
compound
words
which
we
can
not
tell
why
is
in
matter
of
fact
denied
to
others
we
feel
the
presence
of
a
certain
character
or
genius
in
each
which
determines
its
path
and
its
range
and
to
discover
and
enter
into
it
is
one
part
of
refined
scholarship
and
when
particular
writers
in
consequence
perhaps
of
some
theory
tax
a
language
beyond
its
powers
the
failure
is
conspicuous
very
subtle
too
and
difficult
to
draw
out
are
the
principles
on
which
depends
the
formation
of
proper
names
in
a
particular
people
in
works
of
fiction
names
or
titles
significant
or
ludicrous
must
be
invented
for
the
characters
introduced
and
some
authors
excel
in
their
fabrication
while
others
are
equally
unfortunate
foreign
novels
perhaps
attempt
to
frame
english
surnames
and
signally
fail
yet
what
every
one
feels
to
be
the
case
no
one
can
analyze
that
is
our
surnames
are
constructed
on
a
law
which
is
only
exhibited
in
particular
instances
and
which
rules
their
formation
on
certain
though
subtle
determinations
and
so
in
philosophy
the
systems
of
physics
or
morals
which
go
by
celebrated
names
proceed
upon
the
assumption
of
certain
conditions
which
are
necessary
for
every
stage
of
their
development
the
newtonian
theory
of
gravitation
is
based
on
certain
axioms
for
instance
that
the
fewest
causes
assignable
for
phenomena
are
the
true
ones
and
the
application
of
science
to
practical
purposes
depends
upon
the
hypothesis
that
what
happens
will
happen
and
so
in
military
matters
the
discovery
of
gunpowder
developed
the
science
of
attack
and
defence
in
a
new
instrumentality
again
it
is
said
that
when
napoleon
began
his
career
of
victories
the
generals
pronounced
that
his
battles
were
fought
against
rule
and
that
he
ought
not
to
be
victorious
so
states
have
their
respective
policies
on
which
they
move
forward
and
which
are
the
conditions
of
their
thus
it
is
sometimes
said
that
the
true
policy
of
the
american
union
or
the
law
of
its
prosperity
is
not
the
enlargement
of
its
territory
but
the
cultivation
of
its
internal
resources
thus
russia
is
said
to
be
weak
in
attack
strong
in
defence
and
to
grow
not
by
the
sword
but
by
diplomacy
thus
islamism
is
said
to
be
the
form
or
life
of
the
ottoman
and
protestantism
of
the
british
empire
and
the
admission
of
european
ideas
into
the
one
or
of
catholic
ideas
into
the
other
to
be
the
destruction
of
the
respective
conditions
of
their
power
thus
augustus
and
tiberius
governed
by
dissimulation
thus
pericles
in
his
funeral
oration
draws
out
the
principles
of
the
athenian
commonwealth
that
it
is
carried
on
not
by
formal
and
severe
enactments
but
by
the
ethical
character
and
spontaneous
energy
of
the
people
the
political
principles
of
christianity
if
it
be
right
to
use
such
words
of
a
divine
polity
are
laid
down
for
us
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
contrariwise
to
other
empires
christians
conquer
by
yielding
they
gain
influence
by
shrinking
from
it
they
possess
the
earth
by
renouncing
it
gibbon
speaks
of
the
vices
of
the
clergy
as
being
to
a
philosophic
eye
far
less
dangerous
than
their
virtues
again
as
to
judaism
it
may
be
asked
on
what
law
it
developed
that
is
whether
mahometanism
may
not
be
considered
as
a
sort
of
judaism
as
formed
by
the
presence
of
a
different
class
of
influences
in
this
contrast
between
them
perhaps
it
may
be
said
that
the
expectation
of
a
messiah
was
the
principle
or
law
which
expanded
the
elements
almost
common
to
judaism
with
mahometanism
into
their
respective
characteristic
shapes
one
of
the
points
of
discipline
to
which
wesley
attached
most
importance
was
that
of
preaching
early
in
the
morning
this
was
his
principle
in
georgia
he
began
preaching
at
five
every
day
winter
and
summer
early
preaching
he
said
is
the
glory
of
the
methodists
whenever
this
is
dropt
they
will
dwindle
away
into
nothing
they
have
lost
their
first
love
they
are
a
fallen
people
now
these
instances
show
as
has
been
incidentally
observed
of
some
of
them
that
the
destruction
of
the
special
laws
or
principles
of
a
development
is
its
corruption
thus
as
to
nations
when
we
talk
of
the
spirit
of
a
people
being
lost
we
do
not
mean
that
this
or
that
act
has
been
committed
or
measure
carried
but
that
certain
lines
of
thought
or
conduct
by
which
it
has
grown
great
are
abandoned
thus
the
roman
poets
consider
their
state
in
course
of
ruin
because
its
and
were
failing
and
so
we
speak
of
countries
or
persons
as
being
in
a
false
position
when
they
take
up
a
course
of
policy
or
assume
a
profession
inconsistent
with
their
natural
interests
or
real
character
judaism
again
was
rejected
when
it
rejected
the
messiah
thus
the
or
the
alteration
of
the
on
which
an
idea
has
developed
is
a
second
mark
of
discrimination
between
a
true
development
and
a
corruption
section
iii
third
note
power
of
assimilation
in
the
physical
world
whatever
has
life
is
characterized
by
growth
so
that
in
no
respect
to
grow
is
to
cease
to
live
it
grows
by
taking
into
its
own
substance
external
materials
and
this
absorption
or
assimilation
is
completed
when
the
materials
appropriated
come
to
belong
to
it
or
enter
into
its
unity
two
things
can
not
become
one
except
there
be
a
power
of
assimilation
in
one
or
the
other
sometimes
assimilation
is
effected
only
with
an
effort
it
is
possible
to
die
of
repletion
and
there
are
animals
who
lie
torpid
for
a
time
under
the
contest
between
the
foreign
substance
and
the
assimilating
power
and
different
food
is
proper
for
different
recipients
this
analogy
may
be
taken
to
illustrate
certain
peculiarities
in
the
growth
or
development
in
ideas
which
were
noticed
in
the
first
chapter
it
is
otherwise
with
mathematical
and
other
abstract
creations
which
like
the
soul
itself
are
solitary
and
but
doctrines
and
views
which
relate
to
man
are
not
placed
in
a
void
but
in
the
crowded
world
and
make
way
for
themselves
by
interpenetration
and
develope
by
absorption
facts
and
opinions
which
have
hitherto
been
regarded
in
other
relations
and
grouped
round
other
centres
henceforth
are
gradually
attracted
to
a
new
influence
and
subjected
to
a
new
sovereign
they
are
modified
laid
down
afresh
thrust
aside
as
the
case
may
be
a
new
element
of
order
and
composition
has
come
among
them
and
its
life
is
proved
by
this
capacity
of
expansion
without
disarrangement
or
dissolution
an
eclectic
conservative
assimilating
healing
moulding
process
a
unitive
power
is
of
the
essence
and
a
third
test
of
a
faithful
development
thus
a
power
of
development
is
a
proof
of
life
not
only
in
its
essay
but
especially
in
its
success
for
a
mere
formula
either
does
not
expand
or
is
shattered
in
expanding
a
living
idea
becomes
many
yet
remains
one
the
attempt
at
development
shows
the
presence
of
a
principle
and
its
success
the
presence
of
an
idea
principles
stimulate
thought
and
an
idea
concentrates
it
the
idea
never
was
that
throve
and
lasted
yet
like
mathematical
truth
incorporated
nothing
from
external
sources
so
far
from
the
fact
of
such
incorporation
implying
corruption
as
is
sometimes
supposed
development
is
a
process
of
incorporation
mahometanism
may
be
in
external
developments
scarcely
more
than
a
compound
of
other
theologies
yet
no
one
would
deny
that
there
has
been
a
living
idea
somewhere
in
a
religion
which
has
been
so
strong
so
wide
so
lasting
a
bond
of
union
in
the
history
of
the
world
why
it
has
not
continued
to
develope
after
its
first
preaching
if
this
be
the
case
as
it
seems
to
be
can
not
be
determined
without
a
greater
knowledge
of
that
religion
and
how
far
it
is
merely
political
how
far
theological
than
we
commonly
possess
in
christianity
opinion
while
a
raw
material
is
called
philosophy
or
scholasticism
when
a
rejected
refuse
it
is
called
heresy
ideas
are
more
open
to
an
external
bias
in
their
commencement
than
afterwards
hence
the
great
majority
of
writers
who
consider
the
medieval
church
corrupt
trace
its
corruption
to
the
first
four
centuries
not
to
what
are
called
the
dark
ages
that
an
idea
more
readily
coalesces
with
these
ideas
than
with
those
does
not
show
that
it
has
been
unduly
influenced
that
is
corrupted
by
them
but
that
it
has
an
antecedent
affinity
to
them
at
least
it
shall
be
assumed
here
that
when
the
gospels
speak
of
virtue
going
out
of
our
lord
and
of
his
healing
with
the
clay
which
his
lips
had
moistened
they
afford
instances
not
of
a
perversion
of
christianity
but
of
affinity
to
notions
which
were
external
to
it
and
that
paul
was
not
biassed
by
orientalism
though
he
said
after
the
manner
of
some
eastern
sects
that
it
was
excellent
not
to
touch
a
woman
thus
in
politics
too
ideas
are
sometimes
proposed
discussed
rejected
or
adopted
as
it
may
happen
and
sometimes
they
are
shown
to
be
unmeaning
and
impossible
sometimes
they
are
true
but
partially
so
or
in
subordination
to
other
ideas
with
which
in
consequence
they
are
as
wholes
or
in
part

far
as
these

affinities

them
the
power

thus
recognized
as
a

of
life
bentham
system
was
an
attempt
to
make
the
circle
of
legal
and
moral
truths
developments
of
certain
principles
of
his
own
those
principles
of
his
may
if
it
so
happen
prove
unequal
to
the
weight
of
truths
which
are
eternal
and
the
system
founded
on
them
may
break
into
pieces
or
again
a
state
may
absorb
certain
of
them
for
which
it
has
affinity
that
is
it
may
develope
in
benthamism
yet
remain
in
substance
what
it
was
before
in
the
history
of
the
french
revolution
we
read
of
many
middle
parties
who
attempted
to
form
theories
of
constitutions
short
of
those
which
they
would
call
extreme
and
successively
failed
from
the
want
of
power
or
reality
in
their
characteristic
ideas
the
attempted
a
middle
way
between
orthodoxy
and
heresy
but
could
not
stand
their
ground
at
length
part
fell
into
macedonianism
and
part
joined
the
church
the
stronger
and
more
living
is
an
idea
that
is
the
more
powerful
hold
it
exercises
on
the
minds
of
men
the
more
able
is
it
to
dispense
with
safeguards
and
trust
to
itself
against
the
danger
of
corruption
as
strong
frames
exult
in
their
agility
and
healthy
constitutions
throw
off
ailments
so
parties
or
schools
that
live
can
afford
to
be
rash
and
will
sometimes
be
betrayed
into
extravagances
yet
are
brought
right
by
their
inherent
vigour
on
the
other
hand
unreal
systems
are
commonly
decent
externally
forms
subscriptions
or
articles
of
religion
are
indispensable
when
the
principle
of
life
is
weakly
thus
presbyterianism
has
maintained
its
original
theology
in
scotland
where
legal
subscriptions
are
enforced
while
it
has
run
into
arianism
or
unitarianism
where
that
protection
is
away
we
have
yet
to
see
whether
the
free
kirk
can
keep
its
present
theological
ground
the
church
of
rome
can
consult
expedience
more
freely
than
other
bodies
as
trusting
to
her
living
tradition
and
is
sometimes
thought
to
disregard
principle
and
scruple
when
she
is
but
dispensing
with
forms
thus
saints
are
often
characterized
by
acts
which
are
no
pattern
for
others
and
the
most
gifted
men
are
by
reason
of
their
very
gifts
sometimes
led
into
fatal
inadvertences
hence
vows
are
the
wise
defence
of
unstable
virtue
and
general
rules
the
refuge
of
feeble
authority
and
so
much
may
suffice
on
the
of
faithful
developments
which
constitutes
their
third
characteristic
section
iv
fourth
note
logical
sequence
logic
is
the
organization
of
thought
and
as
being
such
is
a
security
for
the
faithfulness
of
intellectual
developments
and
the
necessity
of
using
it
is
undeniable
as
far
as
this
that
its
rules
must
not
be
transgressed
that
it
is
not
brought
into
exercise
in
every
instance
of
doctrinal
development
is
owing
to
the
varieties
of
mental
constitution
whether
in
communities
or
in
individuals
with
whom
great
truths
or
seeming
truths
are
lodged
the
question
indeed
may
be
asked
whether
a
development
can
be
other
in
any
case
than
a
logical
operation
but
if
by
this
is
meant
a
conscious
reasoning
from
premisses
to
conclusion
of
course
the
answer
must
be
in
the
negative
an
idea
under
one
or
other
of
its
aspects
grows
in
the
mind
by
remaining
there
it
becomes
familiar
and
distinct
and
is
viewed
in
its
relations
it
leads
to
other
aspects
and
these
again
to
others
subtle
recondite
original
according
to
the
character
intellectual
and
moral
of
the
recipient
and
thus
a
body
of
thought
is
gradually
formed
without
his
recognizing
what
is
going
on
within
him
and
all
this
while
or
at
least
from
time
to
time
external
circumstances
elicit
into
formal
statement
the
thoughts
which
are
coming
into
being
in
the
depths
of
his
mind
and
soon
he
has
to
begin
to
defend
them
and
then
again
a
further
process
must
take
place
of
analyzing
his
statements
and
ascertaining
their
dependence
one
on
another
and
thus
he
is
led
to
regard
as
consequences
and
to
trace
to
principles
what
hitherto
he
has
discerned
by
a
moral
perception
and
adopted
on
sympathy
and
logic
is
brought
in
to
arrange
and
inculcate
what
no
science
was
employed
in
gaining
and
so
in
the
same
way
such
intellectual
processes
as
are
carried
on
silently
and
spontaneously
in
the
mind
of
a
party
or
school
of
necessity
come
to
light
at
a
later
date
and
are
recognized
and
their
issues
are
scientifically
arranged
and
then
logic
has
the
further
function
of
propagation
analogy
the
nature
of
the
case
antecedent
probability
application
of
principles
congruity
expedience
being
some
of
the
methods
of
proof
by
which
the
development
is
continued
from
mind
to
mind
and
established
in
the
faith
of
the
community
yet
even
then
the
analysis
is
not
made
on
a
principle
or
with
any
view
to
its
whole
course
and
finished
results
each
argument
is
brought
for
an
immediate
purpose
minds
develope
step
by
step
without
looking
behind
them
or
anticipating
their
goal
and
without
either
intention
or
promise
of
forming
a
system
afterwards
however
this
logical
character
which
the
whole
wears
becomes
a
test
that
the
process
has
been
a
true
development
not
a
perversion
or
corruption
from
its
evident
naturalness
and
in
some
cases
from
the
gravity
distinctness
precision
and
majesty
of
its
advance
and
the
harmony
of
its
proportions
like
the
tall
growth
and
graceful
branching
and
rich
foliage
of
some
vegetable
production
the
process
of
development
thus
capable
of
a
logical
expression
has
sometimes
been
invidiously
spoken
of
as
rationalism
and
contrasted
with
faith
but
though
a
particular
doctrine
or
opinion
which
is
subjected
to
development
may
happen
to
be
rationalistic
and
as
is
the
original
such
are
its
results
and
though
we
may
develope
erroneously
that
is
reason
incorrectly
yet
the
developing
itself
as
little
deserves
that
imputation
in
any
case
as
an
inquiry
into
an
historical
fact
which
we
do
not
thereby
make
but
ascertain
for
instance
whether
or
not
mark
wrote
his
gospel
with
matthew
before
him
or
whether
solomon
brought
his
merchandise
from
tartessus
or
some
indian
port
rationalism
is
the
exercise
of
reason
instead
of
faith
in
matters
of
faith
but
one
does
not
see
how
it
can
be
faith
to
adopt
the
premisses
and
unbelief
to
accept
the
conclusion
at
the
same
time
it
may
be
granted
that
the
spontaneous
process
which
goes
on
within
the
mind
itself
is
higher
and
choicer
than
that
which
is
logical
for
the
latter
being
scientific
is
common
property
and
can
be
taken
and
made
use
of
by
minds
who
are
personally
strangers
in
any
true
sense
both
to
the
ideas
in
question
and
to
their
development
thus
the
holy
apostles
would
without
words
know
all
the
truths
concerning
the
high
doctrines
of
theology
which
controversialists
after
them
have
piously
and
charitably
reduced
to
formul√¶
and
developed
through
argument
thus
justin
or
iren√¶us
might
be
without
any
digested
ideas
of
purgatory
or
original
sin
yet
have
an
intense
feeling
which
they
had
not
defined
or
located
both
of
the
fault
of
our
first
nature
and
the
responsibilities
of
our
nature
regenerate
thus
antony
said
to
the
philosophers
who
came
to
mock
him
he
whose
mind
is
in
health
does
not
need
letters
and
ignatius
loyola
while
yet
an
unlearned
neophyte
was
favoured
with
transcendent
perceptions
of
the
holy
trinity
during
his
penance
at
manresa
thus
athanasius
himself
is
more
powerful
in
statement
and
exposition
than
in
proof
while
in
bellarmine
we
find
the
whole
series
of
doctrines
carefully
drawn
out
duly
adjusted
with
one
another
and
exactly
analyzed
one
by
one
the
history
of
empires
and
of
public
men
supplies
so
many
instances
of
logical
development
in
the
field
of
politics
that
it
is
needless
to
do
more
than
to
refer
to
one
of
them
it
is
illustrated
by
the
words
of
jeroboam
now
shall
this
kingdom
return
to
the
house
of
david
if
this
people
go
up
to
do
sacrifice
in
the
house
of
the
lord
at
jerusalem
wherefore
the
king
took
counsel
and
made
two
calves
of
gold
and
said
unto
them
behold
thy
gods
o
israel
idolatry
was
a
duty
of
kingcraft
with
the
schismatical
kingdom
a
specimen
of
logical
development
is
afforded
us
in
the
history
of
lutheranism
as
it
has
of
late
years
been
drawn
out
by
various
english
writers
luther
started
on
a
double
basis
his
dogmatic
principle
being
contradicted
by
his
right
of
private
judgment
and
his
sacramental
by
his
theory
of
justification
the
sacramental
element
never
showed
signs
of
life
but
on
his
death
that
which
he
represented
in
his
own
person
as
a
teacher
the
dogmatic
gained
the
ascendancy
and
every
expression
of
his
upon
controverted
points
became
a
norm
for
the
party
which
at
all
times
the
largest
was
at
last
coextensive
with
the
church
itself
this
almost
idolatrous
veneration
was
perhaps
increased
by
the
selection
of
declarations
of
faith
of
which
the
substance
on
the
whole
was
his
for
the
symbolical
books
of
his
church
next
a
reaction
took
place
private
judgment
was
restored
to
the
supremacy
calixtus
put
reason
and
spener
the
religion
of
the
heart
in
the
place
of
dogmatic
correctness
pietism
for
the
time
died
away
but
rationalism
developed
in
wolf
who
professed
to
prove
all
the
orthodox
doctrines
by
a
process
of
reasoning
from
premisses
level
with
the
reason
it
was
soon
found
that
the
instrument
which
wolf
had
used
for
orthodoxy
could
as
plausibly
be
used
against
it
in
his
hands
it
had
proved
the
creed
in
the
hands
of
semler
ernesti
and
others
it
disproved
the
authority
of
scripture
what
was
religion
to
be
made
to
consist
in
now
a
sort
of
philosophical
pietism
followed
or
rather
spener
pietism
and
the
original
theory
of
justification
were
analyzed
more
thoroughly
and
issued
in
various
theories
of
pantheism
which
from
the
first
was
at
the
bottom
of
luther
doctrine
and
personal
character
and
this
appears
to
be
the
state
of
lutheranism
at
present
whether
we
view
it
in
the
philosophy
of
kant
in
the
open
infidelity
of
strauss
or
in
the
religious
professions
of
the
new
evangelical
church
of
prussia
applying
this
instance
to
the
subject
which
it
has
been
here
brought
to
illustrate
i
should
say
that
the
equable
and
orderly
march
and
natural
succession
of
views
by
which
the
creed
of
luther
has
been
changed
into
the
infidel
or
heretical
philosophy
of
his
present
representatives
is
a
proof
that
that
change
is
no
perversion
or
corruption
but
a
faithful
development
of
the
original
idea
this
is
but
one
out
of
many
instances
with
which
the
history
of
the
church
supplies
us
the
fortunes
of
a
theological
school
are
made
in
a
later
generation
the
measure
of
the
teaching
of
its
founder
the
great
origen
after
his
many
labours
died
in
peace
his
immediate
pupils
were
saints
and
rulers
in
the
church
he
has
the
praise
of
athanasius
st
basil
and
gregory
nazianzen
and
furnishes
materials
to
ambrose
and
hilary
yet
as
time
proceeded
a
definite
heterodoxy
was
the
growing
result
of
his
theology
and
at
length
three
hundred
years
after
his
death
he
was
condemned
and
as
has
generally
been
considered
in
an
ecumenical
council
diodorus
of
tarsus
says
tillemont
died
at
an
advanced
age
in
the
peace
of
the
church
honoured
by
the
praises
of
the
greatest
saints
and
crowned
with
a
glory
which
having
ever
attended
him
through
life
followed
him
after
his
death
yet
cyril
of
alexandria
considers
him
and
theodore
of
mopsuestia
the
true
authors
of
nestorianism
and
he
was
placed
in
the
event
by
the
nestorians
among
their
saints
theodore
himself
was
condemned
after
his
death
by
the
same
council
which
is
said
to
have
condemned
origen
and
is
justly
considered
the
chief
rationalizing
doctor
of
antiquity
yet
he
was
in
the
highest
repute
in
his
day
and
the
eastern
synod
complains
as
quoted
by
facundus
that
blessed
theodore
who
died
so
happily
who
was
so
eminent
a
teacher
for
five
and
forty
years
and
overthrew
every
heresy
and
in
his
lifetime
experienced
no
imputation
from
the
orthodox
now
after
his
death
so
long
ago
after
his
many
conflicts
after
his
ten
thousand
books
composed
in
refutation
of
errors
after
his
approval
in
the
sight
of
priests
emperors
and
people
runs
the
risk
of
receiving
the
reward
of
heretics
and
of
being
called
their
chief
there
is
a
certain
continuous
advance
and
determinate
path
which
belong
to
the
history
of
a
doctrine
policy
or
institution
and
which
impress
upon
the
common
sense
of
mankind
that
what
it
ultimately
becomes
is
the
issue
of
what
it
was
at
first
this
sentiment
is
expressed
in
the
proverb
not
limited
to
latin
acta
and
is
sanctioned
by
divine
wisdom
when
warning
us
against
false
prophets
it
says
ye
shall
know
them
by
their
fruits
a
doctrine
then
professed
in
its
mature
years
by
a
philosophy
or
religion
is
likely
to
be
a
true
development
not
a
corruption
in
proportion
as
it
seems
to
be
the
of
its
original
teaching
section
fifth
note
anticipation
of
its
future
since
when
an
idea
is
living
that
is
influential
and
effective
it
is
sure
to
develope
according
to
its
own
nature
and
the
tendencies
which
are
carried
out
on
the
long
run
may
under
favourable
circumstances
show
themselves
early
as
well
as
late
and
logic
is
the
same
in
all
ages
instances
of
a
development
which
is
to
come
though
vague
and
isolated
may
occur
from
the
very
first
though
a
lapse
of
time
be
necessary
to
bring
them
to
perfection
and
since
developments
are
in
great
measure
only
aspects
of
the
idea
from
which
they
proceed
and
all
of
them
are
natural
consequences
of
it
it
is
often
a
matter
of
accident
in
what
order
they
are
carried
out
in
individual
minds
and
it
is
in
no
wise
strange
that
here
and
there
definite
specimens
of
advanced
teaching
should
very
early
occur
which
in
the
historical
course
are
not
found
till
a
late
day
the
fact
then
of
such
early
or
recurring
intimations
of
tendencies
which
afterwards
are
fully
realized
is
a
sort
of
evidence
that
those
later
and
more
systematic
fulfilments
are
only
in
accordance
with
the
original
idea
nothing
is
more
common
for
instance
than
accounts
or
legends
of
the
anticipations
which
great
men
have
given
in
boyhood
of
the
bent
of
their
minds
as
afterwards
displayed
in
their
history
so
much
so
that
the
popular
expectation
has
sometimes
led
to
the
invention
of
them
the
child
cyrus
mimics
a
despot
power
and
athanasius
is
elected
bishop
by
his
playfellows
it
is
noticeable
that
in
the
eleventh
century
when
the
russians
were
but
pirates
upon
the
black
sea
constantinople
was
their
aim
and
that
a
prophesy
was
in
circulation
in
that
city
that
they
should
one
day
gain
possession
of
it
in
the
reign
of
james
the
first
we
have
an
observable
anticipation
of
the
system
of
influence
in
the
management
of
political
parties
which
was
developed
by
sir
walpole
a
century
afterwards
this
attempt
is
traced
by
a
living
writer
to
the
ingenuity
of
lord
bacon
he
submitted
to
the
king
that
there
were
expedients
for
more
judiciously
managing
a
house
of
commons
that
much
might
be
done
by
forethought
towards
filling
the
house
with
persons
winning
or
blinding
the
lawyers
and
drawing
the
chief
constituent
bodies
of
the
assembly
the
country
gentlemen
the
merchants
the
courtiers
to
act
for
the
king
advantage
that
it
would
be
expedient
to
tender
voluntarily
certain
graces
and
modifications
of
the
king
prerogative
the
writer
adds
this
circumstance
like
several
others
in
the
present
reign
is
curious
as
it
shows
the
rise
of
a
systematic
parliamentary
influence
which
was
one
day
to
become
the
mainspring
of
government
arcesilas
and
carneades
the
founders
of
the
later
academy
are
known
to
have
innovated
on
the
platonic
doctrine
by
inculcating
a
universal
scepticism
and
they
did
this
as
if
on
the
authority
of
socrates
who
had
adopted
the
method
of
against
the
sophists
on
their
professing
to
know
everything
this
of
course
was
an
insufficient
plea
however
could
it
be
shown
that
socrates
did
on
one
or
two
occasions
evidence
deliberate
doubts
on
the
great
principles
of

morals
would
any
one
deny
that
the
innovation
in

had
grounds
for
being
considered
a
true
development
not
a
corruption
it
is
certain
that
in
the
idea
of
monachism
prevalent
in
ancient
times
manual
labour
had
a
more
prominent
place
than
study
so
much
so
that
de
ranc√©
the
celebrated
abbot
of
la
trappe
in
controversy
with
mabillon
maintained
his
ground
with
great
plausibility
against
the
latter
apology
for
the
literary
occupations
for
which
the
benedictines
of
france
are
so
famous
nor
can
it
be
denied
that
the
labours
of
such
as
mabillon
and
montfaucon
are
at
least
a
development
upon
the
simplicity
of
the
primitive
institution
and
yet
it
is
remarkable
that
pachomius
the
first
author
of
a
monastic
rule
enjoined
a
library
in
each
of
his
houses
and
appointed
conferences
and
disputations
three
times
a
week
on
religious
subjects

or

st
basil
the
founder
of
monachism
in
pontus
one
of
the
most
learned
of
the
greek
fathers
wrote
his
theological
treatises

labour
jerome
the
author
of
the
latin
versions
of

lived
as
a
poor

in

these
indeed
were
but
exceptions
in
the
character
of
early
monachism
but
they
suggest
its
capabilities
and
anticipate
its
history
literature
is
certainly
not
inconsistent
with
its
idea
in
the
controversies
with
the
gnostics
in
the
second
century
striking
anticipations
occasionally
occur
in
the
works
of
their
catholic
opponents
of
the
formal
dogmatic
teaching
developed
in
the
church
in
the
course
of
the
nestorian
and
monophysite
controversies

paul
of
samosata
one
of
the
first
disciples
of
the
syrian
school
of
theology
taught
a
heresy
sufficiently
like
nestorianism
in
which
that
school
terminated
to
be
mistaken
for
it
in
later
times
yet
for
a
long
while
after
him
the
characteristic
of
the
school
was
arianism
an
opposite
heresy
lutheranism
has
by
this
time
become
in
most
places
almost
simple
heresy
or
infidelity
it
has
terminated
if
it
has
even
yet
reached
its
limit
in
a
denial
both
of
the
canon
and
the
creed
nay
of
many
principles
of
morals
accordingly
the
question
arises
whether
these
conclusions
are
in
fairness
to
be
connected
with
its
original
teaching
or
are
a
corruption
and
it
is
no
little
aid
towards
its
resolution
to
find
that
luther
himself
at
one
time
rejected
the
apocalypse
called
the
epistle
of
james
straminea
condemned
the
word
trinity
fell
into
a
kind
of
eutychianism
in
his
view
of
the
holy
eucharist
and
in
a
particular
case
sanctioned
bigamy
calvinism
again
in
various
distinct
countries
has
become
socinianism
and
calvin
himself
seems
to
have
denied
our
lord
eternal
sonship
and
ridiculed
the
nicene
creed
another
evidence
then
of
the
faithfulness
of
an
ultimate
development
is
its
at
an
early
period

the

there
is
a

that

the

is

great
a
paradox

can
not
be
maintained
as
that
truth
literally
leads
to
falsehood
or
that
there
can
be
an
excess
of
virtue
but
the
appearance
of
things
and
the
popular
language
about
them
will
at
least
serve
us
in
obtaining
an
additional
test
for
the
discrimination
of
a
development
of
an
idea
from
its
corruption
a
true
development
then
may
be
described
as
one
which
is
conservative
of
the
course
of
antecedent
developments
being
really
those
antecedents
and
something
besides
them
it
is
an
addition
which
illustrates
not
obscures
corroborates
not
corrects
the
body
of
thought
from
which
it
proceeds
and
this
is
its
characteristic
as
contrasted
with
a
corruption
for
instance
a
gradual
conversion
from
a
false
to
a
true
religion
plainly
has
much
of
the
character
of
a
continuous
process
or
a
development
in
the
mind
itself
even
when
the
two
religions
which
are
the
limits
of
its
course
are
antagonists
now
let
it
be
observed
that
such
a
change
consists
in
addition
and
increase
chiefly
not
in
destruction
true
religion
is
the
summit
and
perfection
of
false
religions
it
combines
in
one
whatever
there
is
of
good
and
true
separately
remaining
in
each
and
in
like
manner
the
catholic
creed
is
for
the
most
part
the
combination
of
separate
truths
which
heretics
have
divided
among
themselves
and
err
in
dividing
so
that
in
matter
of
fact
if
a
religious
mind
were
educated
in
and
sincerely
attached
to
some
form
of
heathenism
or
heresy
and
then
were
brought
under
the
light
of
truth
it
would
be
drawn
off
from
error
into
the
truth
not
by
losing
what
it
had
but
by
gaining
what
it
had
not
not
by
being
unclothed
but
by
being
upon
mortality
may
be
swallowed
up
of
life
that
same
principle
of
faith
which
attaches
it
at
first
to
the
wrong
doctrine
would
attach
it
to
the
truth
and
that
portion
of
its
original
doctrine
which
was
to
be
cast
off
as
absolutely
false
would
not
be
directly
rejected
but
indirectly
the
reception
of
the
truth
which
is
its
opposite
true
conversion
is
ever
of
a
positive
not
a
negative
character
such
too
is
the
theory
of
the
fathers
as
regards
the
doctrines
fixed
by
councils
as
is
instanced
in
the
language
of
leo
to
be
seeking
for
what
has
been
disclosed
to
reconsider
what
has
been
finished
to
tear
up
what
has
been
laid
down
what
is
this
but
to
be
unthankful
for
what
is
gained
vincentius
of
lerins
in
like
manner
speaks
of
the
development
of
christian
doctrine
as
fidei
non
and
so
as
regards
the
jewish
law
our
lord
said
that
he
came
not
to
destroy
but
to
fulfil
mahomet
is
accused
of
contradicting
his
earlier
revelations
by
his
later
which
is
a
thing
so
well
known
to
those
of
his
sect
that
they
all
acknowledge
it
and
therefore
when
the
contradictions
are
such
as
they
can
not
solve
them
then
they
will
have
one
of
the
contradictory
places
to
be
revoked
and
they
reckon
in
the
whole
alcoran
about
a
hundred
and
fifty
verses
which
are
thus
revoked
schelling
says
dewar
considers
that
the
time
has
arrived
when
an
esoteric
speculative
christianity
ought
to
take
the
place
of
the
exoteric
empiricism
which
has
hitherto
prevailed
this
german
philosopher
acknowledges
that
such
a
project
is
opposed
to
the
evident
design
of
the
church
and
of
her
earliest
teachers
when
roman
catholics
are
accused
of
substituting
another
gospel
for
the
primitive
creed
they
answer
that
they
hold
and
can
show
that
they
hold
the
doctrines
of
the
incarnation
and
atonement
as
firmly
as
any
protestant
can
state
them
to
this
it
is
replied
that
they
do
certainly
profess
them
but
that
they
obscure
and
virtually
annul
them
by
their
additions
that
the
of
mary
and
the
saints
is
no
development
of
the
truth
but
a
corruption
and
a
religious
mischief
to
those
doctrines
of
which
it
is
the
corruption
because
it
draws
away
the
mind
and
heart
from
christ
but
they
answer
that
so
far
from
this
it
subserves
illustrates
protects
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
loving
kindness
and
mediation
thus
the
parties
in
controversy
join
issue
on
the
common
ground
that
a
developed
doctrine
which
reverses
the
course
of
development
which
has
preceded
it
is
no
true
development
but
a
corruption
also
that
what
is
corrupt
acts
as
an
element
of
unhealthiness
towards
what
is
sound
this
subject
however
will
come
before
us
in
its
proper
place
by
and
by
blackstone
supplies
us
with
an
instance
in
another
of
a
development
which
is
justified
by
its
utility
when
he
observes
that
when
society
is
once
formed
government
results
of
course
as
necessary
to
preserve
and
to
keep
that
society
in
order
on
the
contrary
when
the
long
parliament
proceeded
to
usurp
the
executive
they
impaired
the
popular
liberties
which
they
seemed
to
be
advancing
for
the
security
of
those
liberties
depends
on
the
separation
of
the
executive
and
legislative
powers
or
on
the
enactors
being
subjects
not
executors
of
the
laws
and
in
the
history
of
ancient
rome
from
the
time
that
the
privileges
gained
by
the
tribunes
in
behalf
of
the
people
became
an
object
of
ambition
to
themselves
the
development
had
changed
into
a
corruption
and
thus
a
sixth
test
of
a
true
development
is
that
it
is
of
a
of
what

in

in

in

not
fill
up

overflow
for
this

from
the
external
counteractions
of
truth

bear
it
back
let
the

be
removed
and
the
world
will
soon
come

and
so
again
if
the

age

became
worse
and
worse
till
there
was
no

still
their
course
of
evil
was
continually
broken
by
reformations
and
was
thrown
back
upon
a
less
advanced
stage
of
declension
it
is
true
that
decay
which
is
one
form
of
corruption
is
slow
but
decay
is
a
state
in
which
there
is
no
violent
or
vigorous
action
at
all
whether
of
a
conservative
or
a
destructive
character
the
hostile
influence
being
powerful
enough
to
enfeeble
the
functions
of
life
but
not
to
quicken
its
own
process
and
thus
we
see
opinions
usages
and
systems
which
are
of
venerable
and
imposing
aspect
but
which
have
no
soundness
within
them
and
keep
together
from
a
habit
of
consistence
or
from
dependence
on
political
institutions
or
they
become
almost
peculiarities
of
a
country
or
the
habits
of
a
race
or
the
fashions
of
society
and
then
at
length
perhaps
they
go
off
suddenly
and
die
out
under
the
first
rough
influence
from
without
such
are
the
superstitions
which
pervade
a
population
like
some
ingrained
dye
or
inveterate
odour
and
which
at
length
come
to
an
end
because
nothing
lasts
for
ever
but
which
run
no
course
and
have
no
history
such
was
the
established
paganism
of
classical
times
which
was
the
fit
subject
of
persecution
for
its
first
breath
made
it
crumble
and

such
apparently
is
the
state
of
the
nestorian

communions
such
might
have
been
the
condition
of
christianity
had
it
been
absorbed
by
the
feudalism
of
the
middle
ages
such
too
is
that
protestantism
or
as
it
sometimes
calls
itself
attachment
to
the
establishment
which
is
not
unfrequently
the
boast
of
the
respectable

whether
mahometanism
external

within

fall
under

description

it
is

such
are
seven
out
of
various
notes
which
may
be
assigned
of
fidelity
in
the
development

point

is
the
unity
and
identity
of
the
idea
with
itself
through
all
stages
of
its
development
from
first
to
last
and
these
are
seven
tokens
that
it
may
rightly
be
accounted
one
and
the
same
all
along
to
guarantee
its
own
substantial
unity
it
must
be
seen
to
be
one
in
type

in
its
system
of
principles

in

unitive
power

externals
one
in

in

witness

early
phases

later

in
the
protection
which
its
later
extend

its
earlier
and

notes
of
fidelity
in
intellectual
developments
to
the
instance
of
christian
doctrine
and
first
as
to
the
note
of
of
i
have
said
above
that
whereas
all
great
ideas
are
found
as
time
goes
on
to
involve
much
which
was
not
seen
at
first
to
belong
to
them
and
have
developments
that
is
enlargements
applications
uses
and
fortunes
very
various
one
security
against
error
and
perversion
in
the
process
is
the
maintenance
of
the
original
type
which
the
idea
presented
to
the
world
at
its
origin
amid
and
through
all
its
apparent
changes
and
vicissitudes
from
first
to
last
how
does
this
apply
to
christianity
what
is
its
original
type
and
has
that
type
been
preserved
in
the
developments
commonly
called
catholic
which
have
followed
and
in
the
church
which
embodies
and
teaches
them
let
us
take
it
as
the
world
now
views
it
in
its
age
and
let
us
take
it
as
the
world
once
viewed
it
in
its
youth
and
let
us
see
whether
there
be
any
great
difference
between
the
early
and
the
later
description
of
it
the
following
statement
will
show
my
meaning
there
is
a
religious
communion
claiming
a
divine
commission
and
holding
all
other
religious
bodies
around
it
heretical
or
infidel
it
is
a
body
it
is
a
sort
of
secret
society
binding
together
its
members
by
influences
and
by
engagements
which
it
is
difficult
for
strangers
to
ascertain
it
is
spread
over
the
known
world
it
may
be
weak
or
insignificant
locally
but
it
is
strong
on
the
whole
from
its
continuity
it
may
be
smaller
than
all
other
religious
bodies
together
but
is
larger
than
each
separately
it
is
a
natural
enemy
to
governments
external
to
itself
it
is
intolerant
and
engrossing
and
tends
to
a
new
modelling
of
society
it
breaks
laws
it
divides
families
it
is
a
gross
superstition
it
is
charged
with
the
foulest
crimes
it
is
despised
by
the
intellect
of
the
day
it
is
frightful
to
the
imagination
of
the
many
and
there
is
but
one
communion
such
place
this
description
before
pliny
or
julian
place
it
before
frederick
the
second
or
guizot
apparent
dir√¶
facies
each
knows
at
once
without
asking
a
question
who
is
meant
by
it
one
object
and
only
one
absorbs
each
item
of
the
detail
of
the
delineation
section
i
the
church
of
the
first
centuries
the
view
of
early
christianity
in
the
eyes
of
witnesses
external
to
it
is
presented
to
us
in
the
brief
but
vivid
descriptions
given
by
tacitus
suetonius
and
pliny
the
only
heathen
writers
who
distinctly
mention
it
for
the
first
hundred
and
fifty
years
tacitus
is
led
to
speak
of
the
religion
on
occasion
of
the
conflagration
of
rome
which
was
popularly
imputed
to
nero
to
put
an
end
to
the
report
he
says
he
laid
the
guilt
on
others
and
visited
them
with
the
most
exquisite
punishment
those
namely
who
held
in
abhorrence
for
their
crimes
flagitia
were
popularly
called
christians
the
author
of
that
profession
was
christ
who
in
the
reign
of
tiberius
was
capitally
punished
by
the
procurator
pontius
pilate
the
deadly
superstition
though
checked
for
a
while
broke
out
afresh
and
that
not
only
throughout
jud√¶a
the
original
seat
of
the
evil
but
through
the
city
also
whither
all
things
atrocious
or
shocking
aut
flow
together
from
every
quarter
and
thrive
at
first
certain
were
seized
who
avowed
it
then
on
their
report
a
vast
multitude
were
convicted
not
so
much
of
firing
the
city
as
of
hatred
of
mankind
humani
after
describing
their
tortures
he
continues
in
consequence
though
they
were
guilty
and
deserved
most
signal
punishment
they
began
to
be
pitied
as
if
destroyed
not
for
any
public
object
but
from
the
barbarity
of
one
man
suetonius
relates
the
same
transactions
thus
capital
punishments
were
inflicted
on
the
christians
a
class
of
men
of
a
new
and
magical
superstition
nov√¶
et
what
gives
additional
character
to
this
statement
is
its
context
for
it
occurs
as
one
out
of
various
police
or
sumptuary
or
domestic
regulations
which
nero
made
such
as
controlling
private
expenses
forbidding
taverns
to
serve
meat
repressing
the
contests
of
theatrical
parties
and
securing
the
integrity
of
wills
when
pliny
was
governor
of
pontus
he
wrote
his
celebrated
letter
to
the
emperor
trajan
to
ask
advice
how
he
was
to
deal
with
the
christians
whom
he
found
there
in
great
numbers
one
of
his
points
of
hesitation
was
whether
the
very
profession
of
christianity
was
not
by
itself
sufficient
to
justify
punishment
whether
the
name
itself
should
be
visited
though
clear
of
flagitious
acts
or
only
when
connected
with
them
he
says
he
had
ordered
for
execution
such
as
persevered
in
their
profession
after
repeated
warnings
as
not
doubting
whatever
it
was
they
professed
that
at
any
rate
contumacy
and
inflexible
obstinacy
ought
to
be
punished
he
required
them
to
invoke
the
gods
to
sacrifice
wine
and
frankincense
to
the
images
of
the
emperor
and
to
blaspheme
christ
to
which
he
adds
it
is
said
no
real
christian
can
be
compelled
renegades
informed
him
that
the
sum
total
of
their
offence
or
fault
was
meeting
before
light
on
an
appointed
day
and
saying
with
one
another
a
form
of
words
to
christ
as
if
to
a
god
and
binding
themselves
by
oath
not
to
the
commission
of
any
wickedness
but
against
the
commission
of
theft
robbery
adultery
breach
of
trust
denial
of
deposits
that
after
this
they
were
accustomed
to
separate
and
then
to
meet
again
for
a
meal
but
eaten
all
together
and
harmless
however
that
they
had
even
left
this
off
after
his
edicts
enforcing
the
imperial
prohibition
of
or
associations
he
proceeded
to
put
two
women
to
the
torture
but
discovered
nothing
beyond
a
bad
and
excessive
superstition
pravam
et
the
contagion
of
which
he
continues
had
spread
through
villages
and
country
till
the
temples
were
emptied
of
worshippers
in
these
testimonies
which
will
form
a
natural
and
convenient
text
for
what
is
to
follow
we
have
various
characteristics
brought
before
us
of
the
religion
to
which
they
relate
it
was
a
superstition
as
all
three
writers
agree
a
bad
and
excessive
superstition
according
to
pliny
a
magical
superstition
according
to
suetonius
a
deadly
superstition
according
to
tacitus
next
it
was
embodied
in
a
society
and
moreover
a
secret
and
unlawful
society
or
and
it
was
a
proselytizing
society
and
its
very
name
was
connected
with
flagitious
atrocious
and
shocking
acts
now
these
few
points
which
are
not
all
which
might
be
set
down
contain
in
themselves
a
distinct
and
significant
description
of
christianity
but
they
have
far
greater
meaning
when
illustrated
by
the
history
of
the
times
the
testimony
of
later
writers
and
the
acts
of
the
roman
government
towards
its
professors
it
is
impossible
to
mistake
the
judgment
passed
on
the
religion
by
these
three
writers
and
still
more
clearly
by
other
writers
and
imperial
functionaries
they
evidently
associated
christianity
with
the
oriental
superstitions
whether
propagated
by
individuals
or
embodied
in
a
rite
which
were
in
that
day
traversing
the
empire
and
which
in
the
event
acted
so
remarkable
a
part
in
breaking
up
the
national
forms
of
worship
and
so
in
preparing
the
way
for
christianity
this
then
is
the
broad
view
which
the
educated
heathen
took
of
christianity
and
if
it
had
been
very
unlike
those
rites
and
curious
arts
in
external
appearance
they
would
not
have
confused
it
with
them
changes
in
society
are
by
a
providential
appointment
commonly
preceded
and
facilitated
by
the
setting
in
of
a
certain
current
in
men
thoughts
and
feelings
in
that
direction
towards
which
a
change
is
to
be
made
and
as
lighter
substances
whirl
about
before
the
tempest
and
presage
it
so
words
and
deeds
ominous
but
not
effective
of
the
coming
revolution
are
circulated
beforehand
through
the
multitude
or
pass
across
the
field
of
events
this
was
specially
the
case
with
christianity
as
became
its
high
dignity
it
came
heralded
and
attended
by
a
crowd
of
shadows
shadows
of
itself
impotent
and
monstrous
as
shadows
are
but
not
at
first
sight
distinguishable
from
it
by
common
spectators
before
the
mission
of
the
apostles
a
movement
of
which
there
had
been
earlier
parallels
had
begun
in
egypt
syria
and
the
neighbouring
countries
tending
to
the
propagation
of
new
and
peculiar
forms
of
worship
throughout
the
empire
prophecies
were
afloat
that
some
new
order
of
things
was
coming
in
from
the
east
which
increased
the
existing
unsettlement
of
the
popular
mind
pretenders
made
attempts
to
satisfy
its
wants
and
old
traditions
of
the
truth
embodied
for
ages
in
local
or
in
national
religions
gave
to
these
attempts
a
doctrinal
and
ritual
shape
which
became
an
additional
point
of
resemblance
to
that
truth
which
was
soon
visibly
to
appear
the
distinctive
character
of
the
rites
in
question
lay
in
their
appealing
to
the
gloomy
rather
than
to
the
cheerful
and
hopeful
feelings
and
in
their
influencing
the
mind
through
fear
the
notions
of
guilt
and
expiation
of
evil
and
good
to
come
and
of
dealings
with
the
invisible
world
were
in
some
shape
or
other
in
them
and
formed
a
striking
contrast
to
the
classical
polytheism
which
was
gay
and
graceful
as
was
natural
in
a
civilized
age
the
new
rites
on
the
other
hand
were
secret
their
doctrine
was
mysterious
their
profession
was
a
discipline
beginning
in
a
formal
initiation
manifested
in
an
association
and
exercised
in
privation
and
pain
they
were
from
the
nature
of
the
case
proselytizing
societies
for
they
were
rising
into
power
nor
were
they
local
but
vagrant
restless
intrusive
and
encroaching
their
pretensions
to
supernatural
knowledge
brought
them
into
easy
connexion
with
magic
and
astrology
which
are
as
attractive
to
the
wealthy
and
luxurious
as
the
more
vulgar
superstitions
to
the
populace
such
were
the
rites
of
cybele
isis
and
mithras
such
the
chaldeans
as
they
were
commonly
called
and
the
magi
they
came
from
one
part
of
the
world
and
during
the
first
and
second
century
spread
with
busy
perseverance
to
the
northern
and
western
extremities
of
the
empire
traces
of
the
mysteries
of
cybele
a
syrian
deity
if
the
famous
temple
at
hierapolis
was
hers
have
been
found
in
spain
in
gaul
and
in
britain
as
high
up
as
the
wall
of
severus
the
worship
of
isis
was
the
most
widely
spread
of
all
the
pagan
deities
it
was
received
in
ethiopia
and
in
germany
and
even
the
name
of
paris
has
been
fancifully
traced
to
it
both
worships
as
well
as
the
science
of
magic
had
their
colleges
of
priests
and
devotees
which
were
governed
by
a
president
and
in
some
places
were
supported
by
farms
their
processions
passed
from
town
to
town
begging
as
they
went
and
attracting
proselytes
apuleius
describes
one
of
them
as
seizing
a
whip
accusing
himself
of
some
offence
and
scourging
himself
in
public
these
strollers
or
in
classical
language
told
fortunes
and
distributed
prophetical
tickets
to
the
ignorant
people
who
consulted
them
also
they
were
learned
in
the
doctrine
of
omens
of
lucky
and
unlucky
days
of
the
rites
of
expiation
and
of
sacrifices
such
an
or
itinerant
was
the
notorious
alexander
of
abonotichus
till
he
managed
to
establish
himself
in
pontus
where
he
carried
on
so
successful
an
imposition
that
his
fame
reached
rome
and
men
in
office
and
station
entrusted
him
with
their
dearest
political
secrets
such
a
wanderer
with
a
far
more
religious
bearing
and
a
high
reputation
for
virtue
was
apollonius
of
tyana
who
professed
the
pythagorean
philosophy
claimed
the
gift
of
miracles
and
roamed
about
preaching
teaching
healing
and
prophesying
from
india
and
alexandria
to
athens
and
rome
another
solitary
proselytizer
though
of
an
earlier
time
and
of
an
avowed
profligacy
had
been
the
sacrificulus
viewed
with
such
horror
by
the
roman
senate
as
introducing
the
infamous
bacchic
rites
into
rome
such
again
were
those
degenerate
children
of
a
divine
religion
who
in
the
words
of
their
creator
and
judge
compassed
sea
and
land
to
make
one
proselyte
and
made
him
twofold
more
the
child
of
hell
than
themselves
these
vagrant
religionists
for
the
most
part
professed
a
severe
rule
of
life
and
sometimes
one
of
fanatical
mortification
in
the
mysteries
of
mithras
the
initiation
was
preceded
by
fasting
and
abstinence
and
a
variety
of
painful
trials
it
was
made
by
means
of
a
baptism
as
a
spiritual
washing
and
it
included
an
offering
of
bread
and
some
emblem
of
a
resurrection
in
the
samothracian
rites
it
had
been
a
custom
to
initiate
children
confession
too
of
greater
crimes
seems
to
have
been
required
and
would
naturally
be
involved
in
others
in
the
inquisition
prosecuted
into
the
past
lives
of
the
candidates
for
initiation
the
garments
of
the
converts
were
white
their
calling
was
considered
as
a
warfare
and
was
undertaken
with
a
or
military
oath
the
priests
shaved
their
heads
and
wore
linen
and
when
they
were
dead
were
buried
in
a
sacerdotal
garment
it
is
scarcely
necessary
to
refer
to
the
mutilation
inflicted
on
the
priests
of
cybele
one
instance
of
their
scourgings
has
been
already
mentioned
and
tertullian
speaks
of
their
high
priest
cutting
his
arms
for
the
life
of
the
emperor
marcus
the
priests
of
isis
in
lamentation
for
osiris
tore
their
breasts
with
pine
cones
this
lamentation
was
a
ritual
observance
founded
on
some
religious
mystery
isis
lost
osiris
and
the
initiated
wept
in
memory
of
her
sorrow
the
syrian
goddess
had
wept
over
dead
thammuz
and
her
mystics
commemorated
it
by
a
ceremonial
woe
in
the
rites
of
bacchus
an
image
was
laid
on
a
bier
at
midnight
which
was
bewailed
in
metrical
hymns
the
god
was
supposed
to
die
and
then
to
revive
nor
was
this
the
only
worship
which
was
continued
through
the
night
while
some
of
the
rites
were
performed
in
caves
only
a
heavenly
light
can
give
purity
to
nocturnal
and
subterraneous
worship
caves
were
at
that
time
appropriated
to
the
worship
of
the
infernal
gods
it
was
but
natural
that
these
wild
religions
should
be
connected
with
magic
and
its
kindred
arts
magic
has
at
all
times
led
to
cruelty
and
licentiousness
would
be
the
inevitable
reaction
from
a
temporary
strictness
an
extraordinary
profession
when
men
are
in
a
state
of
mere
nature
makes
hypocrites
or
madmen
and
will
in
no
long
time
be
discarded
except
by
the
few
the
world
of
that
day
associated
together
in
one
company
isiac
phrygian
mithriac
chaldean
wizard
astrologer
itinerant
and
as
was
not
unnatural
jew
magic
was
professed
by
the
profligate
alexander
and
was
imputed
to
the
grave
apollonius
the
rites
of
mithras
came
from
the
magi
of
persia
and
it
is
obviously
difficult
to
distinguish
in
principle
the
ceremonies
of
the
syrian
taurobolium
from
those
of
the
necyomantia
in
the
odyssey
or
of
canidia
in
horace
the
theodosian
code
calls
magic
generally
a
superstition
and
magic
orgies
mysteries
and
sabbathizings
were
referred
to
the
same
barbarous
origin
magical
superstitions
the
rites
of
the
magi
the
promises
of
the
chaldeans
and
the
mathematici
are
familiar
to
the
readers
of
tacitus
the
emperor
otho
an
avowed
patron
of
oriental
fashions
took
part
in
the
rites
of
isis
and
consulted
the
mathematici
vespasian
who
also
consulted
them
is
heard
of
in
egypt
as
performing
miracles
at
the
suggestion
of
serapis
tiberius
in
an
edict
classes
together
egyptian
and
jewish
rites
and
tacitus
and
suetonius
in
recording
it
speak
of
the
two
religions
together
as
augustus
had
already
associated
them
together
as
superstitions
and
as
unlawful
and
that
in
contrast
to
others
of
a
like
foreign
origin
as
to
foreign
rites
says
suetonius
as
he
paid
more
reverence
to
those
which
were
old
and
enjoined
so
did
he
hold
the
rest
in
contempt
he
goes
on
to
say
that
even
on
the
he
had
recognized
the
eleusinian
priests
into
whose
mysteries
he
had
been
initiated
at
athens
whereas
when
travelling
in

even
on

score
included

attended

but
in
a
little
time
his
independence
of
the
rejected
people
was
clearly
understood
as
even
the
persecutions
show
and
he
stood
upon
his

ground
still
his
character
did
not
change
in
the
eyes
of
the
world
for
favour
or
for
reproach
he
was
still
associated
with
the
votaries
of
secret
and
magical
rites
the
emperor
hadrian
noted
as
he
is
for
his
inquisitive
temper
and
a
partaker
in
so
many
mysteries
still
believed
that
the
christians
of
egypt
allowed
themselves
in
the
worship
of
serapis
they
are
brought
into
connexion
with
the
magic
of
egypt
in
the
history
of
what
is
commonly
called
the
thundering
legion

far
as
this
that
the

which
relieved
the

army
in

and
which
the
church
ascribed
to
the
prayers
of
the
christian
soldiers
is
by
dio
cassius
attributed
to
an
egyptian
magician
who
obtained
it
by
invoking
mercury
and
other
spirits
this
war
had
been
the
occasion
of
one
of
the
first
recognitions
which
the
state
had
conceded
to
the
oriental
rites
though
statesmen
and
emperors
as
private
men
had
long
taken
part
in
them
the
emperor
marcus
had
been
urged
by
his
fears
of
the
marcomanni
to
resort
to
these
foreign
introductions
and
is
said
to
have
employed
magi
and
chaldeans
in
averting
an
unsuccessful
issue
of
the
war
it
is
observable
that
in
the
growing
countenance
which
was
extended
to
these
rites
in
the
third
century
christianity
came
in
for
a
share
the
chapel
of
alexander
severus
contained
statues
of
abraham
orpheus
apollonius
pythagoras
and
our
lord
here
indeed
as
in
the
case
of
judaism
an
eclectic
philosophy
aided
the
comprehension
of
religions
but
immediately
before
alexander
heliogabalus
who
was
no
philosopher
while
he
formally
seated
his
syrian
idol
in
the
palatine
while
he
observed
the
mysteries
of
cybele
and
adonis
and
celebrated
his
magic
rites
with
human
victims
intended
also
according
to
lampridius
to
unite
with
his
horrible
superstition
the
jewish
and
samaritan
religions
and
the
christian
rite
that
so
the
priesthood
of
heliogabalus
might
comprise
the
mystery
of
every
worship
hence
more
or
less
the
stories
which
occur
in
ecclesiastical
history
of
the
conversion
or
of
the
emperors
to
the
christian
faith
of
hadrian
mamm√¶a
and
others
besides
heliogabalus
and
alexander
such
stories
might
often
mean
little
more
than
that
they
favoured
it
among
other
forms
of
oriental
superstition
what
has
been
said
is
sufficient
to
bring
before
the
mind
an
historical
fact
which
indeed
does
not
need
evidence
upon
the
established
religions
of
europe
the
east
had
renewed
her
encroachments
and
was
pouring
forth
a
family
of
rites
which
in
various
ways
attracted
the
attention
of
the
luxurious
the
political
the
ignorant
the
restless
and
the
remorseful
armenian
chaldee
egyptian
jew
syrian
phrygian
as
the
case
might
be
was
the
designation
of
the
new
hierophant
and
magic
superstition
barbarism
jugglery
were
the
names
given
to
his
rite
by
the
world
in
this
company
appeared
christianity
when
then
three
writers
call
christianity
a
superstition
and
a
magical
superstition
they
were
not
using
words
at
random
or
the
language
of
abuse
but
they
were
describing
it
in
distinct
and
recognized
terms
as
cognate
to
those
gloomy
secret
odious
disreputable
religions
which
were
making
so
much
disturbance
up
and
down
the
empire
the
impression
made
on
the
world
by
circumstances
immediately
before
the
rise
of
christianity
received
a
sort
of
confirmation
upon
its
rise
in
the
appearance
of
the
gnostic
and
kindred
heresies
which
issued
from
the
church
during
the
second
and
third
centuries
their
resemblance
in
ritual
and
constitution
to
the
oriental
religions
sometimes
their
historical
relationship
is
undeniable
and
certainly
it
is
a
singular
coincidence
that
christianity
should
be
first
called
a
magical
superstition
by
suetonius
and
then
should
be
found
in
the
intimate
company
and
seemingly
the
parent
of
a
multitude
of
magical
superstitions
if
there
was
nothing
in
the
religion
itself
to
give
rise
to
such
a
charge
the
gnostic
family
suitably
traces
its
origin
to
a
mixed
race
which
had
commenced
its
national
history
by
associating
orientalism
with
revelation
after
the
captivity
of
the
ten
tribes
samaria
was
colonized
by
men
from
babylon
and
cushan
and
from
ava
and
from
hamath
and
from
sepharvaim
who
were
instructed
at
their
own
instance
in
the
manner
of
the
god
of
the
land
by
one
of
the
priests
of
the
church
of
jeroboam
the
consequence
was
that
they
feared
the
lord
and
served
their
own
gods
of
this
country
was
simon
the
reputed
patriarch
of
the
gnostics
and
he
is
introduced
in
the
acts
of
the
apostles
as
professing
those
magical
powers
which
were
so
principal
a
characteristic
of
the
oriental
mysteries
his
heresy
though
broken
into
a
multitude
of
sects
was
poured
over
the
world
with
a
catholicity
not
inferior
in
its
day
to
that
of
christianity
peter
who
fell
in
with
him
originally
in
samaria
seems
to
have
encountered
him
again
at
rome
at
rome
polycarp
met
marcion
of
pontus
whose
followers
spread
through
italy
egypt
syria
arabia
and
persia
valentinus
preached
his
doctrines
in
alexandria
rome
and
cyprus
and
we
read
of
his
disciples
in
crete
c√¶sarea
antioch
and
other
parts
of
the
east
bardesanes
and
his
followers
were
found
in
mesopotamia
the
carpocratians
are
spoken
of
at
alexandria
at
rome
and
in
cephallenia
the
basilidians
spread
through
the
greater
part
of
egypt
the
ophites
were
apparently
in
bithynia
and
galatia
the
cainites
or
caians
in
africa
and
the
marcosians
in
gaul
to
these
must
be
added
several
sects
which
though
not
strictly
of
the
gnostic
stock
are
associated
with
them
in
date
character
and
origin
the
ebionites
of
palestine
the
cerinthians
who
rose
in
some
part
of
asia
minor
the
encratites
and
kindred
sects
who
spread
from
mesopotamia
to
syria
to
cilicia
and
other
provinces
of
asia
minor
and
thence
to
rome
gaul
aquitaine
and
spain
and
the
montanists
who
with
a
town
in
phrygia
for
their
metropolis
reached
at
length
from
constantinople
to
carthage
when
the
reader
of
christian
history
comes
to
the
second
century
says
burton
he
finds
that
gnosticism
under
some
form
or
other
was
professed
in
every
part
of
the
then
civilized
world
he
finds
it
divided
into
schools
as
numerously
and
as
zealously
attended
as
any
which
greece
or
asia
could
boast
in
their
happiest
days
he
meets
with
names
totally
unknown
to
him
before
which
excited
as
much
sensation
as
those
of
aristotle
or
plato
he
hears
of
volumes
having
been
written
in
support
of
this
new
philosophy
not
one
of
which
has
survived
to
our
own
day
many
of
the
founders
of
these
sects
had
been
christians
others
were
of
jewish
parentage
others
were
more
or
less
connected
in
fact
with
the
pagan
rites
to
which
their
own
bore
so
great
a
resemblance
montanus
seems
even
to
have
been
a
mutilated
priest
of
cybele
the
followers
of
prodicus
professed
to
possess
the
secret
books
of
zoroaster
and
the
doctrine
of
dualism
which
so
many
of
the
sects
held
is
to
be
traced
to
the
same
source
basilides
seems
to
have
recognized
mithras
as
the
supreme
being
or
the
prince
of
angels
or
the
sun
if
mithras
is
equivalent
to
abraxas
which
was
inscribed
upon
his
amulets
on
the
other
hand
he
is
said
to
have
been
taught
by
an
immediate
disciple
of
peter
and
valentinus
by
an
immediate
disciple
of
paul
marcion
was
the
son
of
a
bishop
of
pontus
tatian
a
disciple
of
justin
martyr
whatever
might
be
the
history
of
these
sects
and
though
it
may
be
a
question
whether
they
can
be
properly
called
superstitions
and
though
many
of
them
numbered
educated
men
among
their
teachers
and
followers
they
closely
resembled
at
least
in
ritual
and
profession
the
vagrant
pagan
mysteries
which
have
been
above
described
their
very
name
of
gnostic
implied
the
possession
of
a
secret
which
was
to
be
communicated
to
their
disciples
ceremonial
observances
were
the
preparation
and
symbolical
rites
the
instrument
of
initiation
tatian
and
montanus
the
representatives
of
very
distinct
schools
agreed
in
making
asceticism
a
rule
of
life
the
followers
of
each
of
these
sectaries
abstained
from
wine
the
tatianites
and
marcionites
from
flesh
the
montanists
kept
three
lents
in
the
year
all
the
gnostic
sects
seem
to
have
condemned
marriage
on
one
or
other
reason
the
marcionites
had
three
baptisms
or
more
the
marcosians
had
two
rites
of
what
they
called
redemption
the
latter
of
these
was
celebrated
as
a
marriage
and
the
room
adorned
as
a
a
consecration
to
a
priesthood
then
followed
with
anointing
an
extreme
unction
was
another
of
their
rites
and
prayers
for
the
dead
one
of
their
observances
bardesanes
and
harmonius
were
famous
for
the
beauty
of
their
chants
the
prophecies
of
montanus
were
delivered
like
the
oracles
of
the
heathen
in
a
state
of
enthusiasm
or
ecstasy
to
epiphanes
the
son
of
carpocrates
who
died
at
the
age
of
seventeen
a
temple
was
erected
in
the
island
of
cephallenia
his
birthplace
where
he
was
celebrated
with
hymns
and
sacrifices
a
similar
honour
was
paid
by
the
carpocratians
to
homer
pythagoras
plato
aristotle
as
well
as
to
the
apostles
crowns
were
placed
upon
their
images
and
incense
burned
before
them
in
one
of
the
inscriptions
found
at
cyrene
about
twenty
years
since
zoroaster
pythagoras
epicurus
and
others
are
put
together
with
our
lord
as
guides
of
conduct
these
inscriptions
also
contain
the
carpocratian
tenet
of
a
community
of
women
i
am
unwilling
to
allude
to
the
agap√¶
and
communions
of
certain
of
these
sects
which
were
not
surpassed
in
profligacy
by
the
pagan
rites
of
which
they
were
an
imitation
the
very
name
of
gnostic
became
an
expression
for
the
worst
impurities
and
no
one
dared
eat
bread
with
them
or
use
their
culinary
instruments
or
plates
these
profligate
excesses
are
found
in
connexion
with
the
exercise
of
magic
and
astrology
the
amulets
of
the
basilidians
are
still
extant
in
great
numbers
inscribed
with
symbols
some
christian
some
with
figures
of
isis
serapis
and
anubis
represented
according
to
the
gross
indecencies
of
the
egyptian
mythology
iren√¶us
had
already
connected
together
the
two
crimes
in
speaking
of
the
simonians
their
mystical
priests
he
says
live
in
lewdness
and
practise
magic
according
to
the
ability
of
each
they
use
exorcisms
and
incantations
too
and
seductive
spells
the
virtue
of
spirits
and
dreams
and
all
other
curious
arts
they
diligently
observe
the
marcosians
were
especially
devoted
to
these
curious
arts
which
are
also
ascribed
to
carpocrates
and
apelles
marcion
and
others
are
reported
to
have
used
astrology
tertullian
speaks
generally
of
the
sects
of
his
day
infamous
are
the
dealings
of
the
heretics
with
sorcerers
very
many
with
mountebanks
with
astrologers
with
philosophers
to
wit
such
as
are
given
to
curious
questions
they
everywhere
remember
and
ye
shall
find
such
were
the
gnostics
and
to
external
and
prejudiced
spectators
whether
philosophers
as
celsus
and
porphyry
or
the
multitude
they
wore
an
appearance
sufficiently
like
the
church
to
be
mistaken
for
her
in
the
latter
part
of
the
period
as
she
was
confused
with
the
pagan
mysteries
in
the
earlier
of
course
it
may
happen
that
the
common
estimate
concerning
a
person
or
a
body
is
purely
accidental
and
unfounded
but
in
such
cases
it
is
not
lasting
such
were
the
calumnies
of
and
impurity
in
the
christian
meetings
which
were
almost
extinct
by
the
time
of
origen
and
which
might
arise
from
the
world
confusing
them
with
the
pagan
and
heretical
rites
but
when
it
continues
from
age
to
age
it
is
certainly
an
index
of
a
fact
and
corresponds
to
definite
qualities
in
the
object
to
which
it
relates
in
that
case
even
mistakes
carry
information
for
they
are
cognate
to
the
truth
and
we
can
allow
for
them
often
what
seems
like
a
mistake
is
merely
the
mode
in
which
the
informant
conveys
his
testimony
or
the
impression
which
a
fact
makes
on
him
censure
is
the
natural
tone
of
one
man
in
a
case
where
praise
is
the
natural
tone
of
another
the
very
same
character
or
action
inspires
one
mind
with
enthusiasm
and
another
with
contempt
what
to
one
man
is
magnanimity
to
another
is
romance
and
pride
to
a
third
and
pretence
to
a
fourth
while
to
a
fifth
it
is
simply
unintelligible
and
yet
there
is
a
certain
analogy
in
their
separate
testimonies
which
conveys
to
us
what
the
thing
is
like
and
what
it
is
not
like
when
a
man
acknowledged
note
is
superstition
we
may
be
pretty
sure
we
shall
not
find
him
an
academic
or
an
epicurean
and
even
words
which
are
ambiguous
as
atheist
or
reformer
admit
of
a
sure
interpretation
when
we
are
informed
of
the
speaker
in
like
manner
there
is
a
certain
general
correspondence
between
magic
and
miracle
obstinacy
and
faith
insubordination
and
zeal
for
religion
sophistry
and
argumentative
talent
craft
and
meekness
as
is
obvious
let
us
proceed
then
in
our
contemplation
of
this
reflection
as
it
may
be
called
of
primitive
christianity
in
the
mirror
of
the
world
all
three
writers
tacitus
suetonius
and
pliny
call
it
a
superstition
this
is
no
accidental
imputation
but
is
repeated
by
a
variety
of
subsequent
writers
and
speakers
the
charge
of
thyestean
banquets
scarcely
lasts
a
hundred
years
but
while
pagan
witnesses
are
to
be
found
the
church
is
accused
of
superstition
the
heathen
disputant
in
minucius
calls
christianity
et
demens
the
lawyer
modestinus
speaks
with
an
apparent
allusion
to
christianity
of
weak
minds
being
terrified
the
heathen
magistrate
asks
marcellus
whether
he
and
others
have
put
away
vain
superstitions
and
worship
the
gods
whom
the
emperors
worship
the
pagans
in
arnobius
speak
of
christianity
as
an
execrable
and
unlucky
religion
full
of
impiety
and
sacrilege
contaminating
the
rites
instituted
from
of
old
with
the
superstition
of
its
novelty
the
anonymous
opponent
of
lactantius
calls
it
et
anilis
diocletian
inscription
at
clunia
was
as
it
declared
on
occasion
of
the
total
extinction
of
the
superstition
of
the
christians
and
the
extension
of
the
worship
of
the
gods
maximin
in
his
letter
upon
constantine
edict
still
calls
it
a
superstition
now
what
is
meant
by
the
word
thus
attached
by
a
of
heathen
authorities
to
christianity
at
least
it
can
not
mean
a
religion
in
which
a
man
might
think
what
he
pleased
and
was
set
free
from
all
yokes
whether
of
ignorance
fear
authority
or
priestcraft
when
heathen
writers
call
the
oriental
rites
superstitions
they
evidently
use
the
word
in
its
modern
sense
it
can
not
surely
be
doubted
that
they
apply
it
in
the
same
sense
to
christianity
but
plutarch
explains
for
us
the
word
at
length
in
his
treatise
which
bears
the
name
of
all
kinds
of
fear
he
says
superstition
is
the
most
fatal
to
action
and
resource
he
does
not
fear
the
sea
who
does
not
sail
nor
war
who
does
not
serve
nor
robbers
who
keeps
at
home
nor
the
sycophant
who
is
poor
nor
the
envious
if
he
is
a
private
man
nor
an
earthquake
if
he
lives
in
gaul
nor
thunder
if
he
lives
in
ethiopia
but
he
who
fears
the
gods
fears
everything
earth
seas
air
sky
darkness
light
noises
silence
sleep
slaves
sleep
and
forget
their
masters
of
the
fettered
doth
sleep
lighten
the
chain
inflamed
wounds
ulcers
cruel
and
agonizing
are
not
felt
by
the
sleeping
superstition
alone
has
come
to
no
terms
with
sleep
but
in
the
very
sleep
of
her
victims
as
though
they
were
in
the
realms
of
the
impious
she
raises
horrible
spectres
and
monstrous
phantoms
and
various
pains
and
whirls
the
miserable
soul
about
and
persecutes
it
they
rise
and
instead
of
making
light
of
what
is
unreal
they
fall
into
the
hands
of
quacks
and
conjurers
who
say
the
crone
to
expiate
bathe
in
the
sea
and
sit
all
day
on
the
ground
he
goes
on
to
speak
of
the
introduction
of
uncouth
names
and
barbarous
terms
into
the
divine
and
national
authority
of
religion
observes
that
whereas
slaves
when
they
despair
of
freedom
may
demand
to
be
sold
to
another
master
superstition
admits
of
no
change
of
gods
since
the
god
can
not
be
found
whom
he
will
not
fear
who
fears
the
gods
of
his
family
and
his
birth
who
shudders
at
the
saving
and
the
benignant
who
has
a
trembling
and
dread
at
those
from
whom
we
ask
riches
and
wealth
concord
peace
success
of
all
good
words
and
deeds
he
says
moreover
that
while
death
is
to
all
men
an
end
of
life
it
is
not
so
to
the
superstitious
for
then
there
are
deep
gates
of
hell
to
yawn
and
headlong
streams
of
at
once
fire
and
gloom
are
opened
and
darkness
with
its
many
phantoms
encompasses
ghosts
presenting
horrid
visages
and
wretched
voices
and
judges
and
executioners
and
chasms
and
dens
full
of
innumerable
miseries
presently
he
says
that
in
misfortune
or
sickness
the
superstitious
man
refuses
to
see
physician
or
philosopher
and
cries
suffer
me
o
man
to
undergo
punishment
the
impious
the
cursed
the
hated
of
gods
and
spirits
the
atheist
with
whom
all
along
he
is
contrasting
the
superstitious
disadvantageously
wipes
his
tears
trims
his
hair
doffs
his
mourning
but
how
can
you
address
how
help
the
superstitious
he
sits
apart
in
sackcloth
or
filthy
rags
and
often
he
strips
himself
and
rolls
in
the
mud
and
tells
out
his
sins
and
offences
as
having
eaten
and
drunken
something
or
walked
some
way
which
the
divinity
did
not
allow
and
in
his
best
mood
and
under
the
influence
of
a
superstition
he
sits
at
home
with
sacrifice
and
slaughter
all
round
him
while
the
old
crones
hang
on
him
as
on
a
peg
as
bion
says
any
charm
they
fall
in
with
he
continues
what
men
like
best
are
festivals
banquets
at
the
temples
initiations
orgies
votive
prayers
and
adorations
but
the
superstitious
wishes
indeed
but
is
unable
to
rejoice
he
is
crowned
and
turns
pale
he
sacrifices
and
is
in
fear
he
prays
with
a
quivering
voice
and
burns
incense
with
trembling
hands
and
altogether
belies
the
saying
of
pythagoras
that
we
are
then
in
best
case
when
we
go
to
the
gods
for
superstitious
men
are
in
most
wretched
and
evil
case
approaching
the
houses
or
shrines
of
the
gods
as
if
they
were
the
dens
of
bears
or
the
holes
of
snakes
or
the
caves
of
whales
here
we
have
a
vivid
picture
of
plutarch
idea
of
the
essence
of
superstition
it
was
the
imagination
of
the
existence
of
an
unseen
master
the
bondage
of
a
rule
of
life
of
a
continual
responsibility
obligation
to
attend
to
little
things
the
impossibility
of
escaping
from
duty
the
inability
to
choose
or
change
one
religion
an
interference
with
the
enjoyment
of
life
a
melancholy
view
of
the
world
sense
of
sin
horror
at
guilt
apprehension
of
punishment
dread
depression
anxiety
and
endeavour
to
be
at
peace
with
heaven
and
error
and
absurdity
in
the
methods
chosen
for
the
purpose
such
too
had
been
the
idea
of
the
epicurean
velleius
when
he
shrunk
with
horror
from
the
and
of
the
stoics
such
surely
was
the
meaning
of
tacitus
suetonius
and
pliny
and
hence
of
course
the
frequent
reproach
cast
on
christians
as
credulous
and
the
heathen
objectors
in
minucius
and
lactantius
speak
of
their
tales
celsus
accuses
them
of
assenting
at
random
and
without
reason
saying
do
not
inquire
but
believe
they
lay
it
down
he
says
elsewhere
let
no
educated
man
approach
no
man
of
wisdom
no
man
of
sense
but
if
a
man
be
unlearned
weak
in
intellect
an
infant
let
him
come
with
confidence
confessing
that
these
are
worthy
of
their
god
they
evidently
desire
as
they
are
able
to
convert
none
but
fools
and
vulgar
and
stupid
and
slavish
women
and
boys
they
take
in
the
simple
and
lead
him
where
they
will
they
address
themselves
to
youths
and
the
weak
in
intellect
they
hurry
away
from
the
educated
as
not
fit
subjects
of
their
imposition
and
inveigle
the
rustic
thou
says
the
heathen
magistrate
to
the
martyr
fructuosus
who
as
a
teacher
dost
disseminate
a
new
fable
that
fickle
girls
may
desert
the
groves
and
abandon
jupiter
condemn
if
thou
art
wise
the
anile
creed
hence
the
epithets
of
itinerant
mountebank
conjurer
cheat
sophist
sorcerer
heaped
upon
the
teachers
of
christianity
sometimes
to
account
for
the
report
or
apparent
truth
of
their
miracles
sometimes
to
explain
their
success
our
lord
was
said
to
have
learned
his
miraculous
power
in
egypt
wizard
mediciner
cheat
rogue
conjurer
were
the
epithets
applied
to
him
by
the
opponents
of
eusebius
they
worship
that
crucified
sophist
says
lucian
paul
who
surpasses
all
the
conjurers
and
impostors
who
ever
lived
is
julian
account
of
the
apostle
you
have
sent
through
the
whole
world
says
justin
to
trypho
to
preach
that
a
certain
atheistic
and
lawless
sect
has
sprung
from
one
jesus
a
galilean
cheat
we
know
says
lucian
speaking
of
chaldeans
and
magicians
the
syrian
from
palestine
who
is
the
sophist
in
these
matters
how
many
lunatics
with
eyes
distorted
and
mouth
in
foam
he
raises
and
sends
away
restored
ridding
them
from
the
evil
at
a
great
price
if
any
conjurer
came
to
them
a
man
of
skill
and
knowing
how
to
manage
matters
says
the
same
writer
he
made
money
in
no
time
with
a
broad
grin
at
the
simple
fellows
the
officer
who
had
custody
of
perpetua
feared
her
escape
from
prison
by
magical
incantations
when
tiburtius
had
walked
barefoot
on
hot
coals
his
judge
cried
out
that
christ
had
taught
him
magic
anastasia
was
thrown
into
prison
as
a
mediciner
the
populace
called
out

with

witch
magam

when
bonosus
and
maximilian
bore
the
burning
pitch
without
shrinking
jews
and
gentiles
cried
out
magi
et
what
new
delusion
says
the
heathen
magistrate
concerning
romanus
has
brought
in
these
sophists
to
deny
the
worship
of
the
gods
how
doth
this
chief
sorcerer
mock
us
skilled
by
his
thessalian
charm
to
laugh
at
punishment
hence
we
gather
the
meaning
of
the
word
as
used
by
pliny
when
he
speaks
of
the
christians
saying
with
one
another
a
to
christ
as
to
a
god
he
meant
pretty
much
what
suetonius
expresses
by
the
and
the
words
of
the
writer
and
tacitus
are
still
more
exactly
and
i
may
say
singularly
illustrated
by
clauses
which
occur
in
the
theodosian
code
which
seem
to
show
that
these
historians
were
using
formal
terms
and
phrases
to
express
their
notion
of
christianity
for
instance
tacitus
says
per
flagitia
invisos
vulgus
christianos
and
the
law
against
the
malefici
and
mathematici
in
the
code
speaks
of
those
ob
facinorum
magnitudinem
vulgus
maleficos
again
tacitus
charges
christians
with
the
humani
this
is
the
very
characteristic
of
a
practiser
in
magic
the
laws
call
the
malefici
generis
generis
salutis
this
also
explains
the
phenomenon
which
has
created
so
much
surprise
to
certain
moderns
that
a
grave
historian
like
tacitus
should
apply
to
christians
what
sounds
like
abuse
yet
what
is
the
difficulty
supposing
that
christians
were
considered
mathematici
and
magi
and
these
were
the
secret
intriguers
against
established
government
the
allies
of
desperate
politicians
the
enemies
of
the
established
religion
the
disseminators
of
lying
rumours
the
perpetrators
of
poisonings
and
other
crimes
read
this
says
paley
after
quoting
some
of
the
most
beautiful
and
subduing
passages
of
paul
read
this
and
then
think
of
and
he
goes
on
to
express
a
wish
in
contending
with
heathen
authorities
to
produce
our
books
against
theirs
as
if
it
were
a
matter
of
books
public
men
care
very
little
for
books
the
finest
sentiments
the
most
luminous
philosophy
the
deepest
theology
inspiration
itself
moves
them
but
little
they
look
at
facts
and
care
only
for
facts
the
question
was
what
was
the
worth
what
the
tendency
of
the
christian
body
in
the
state
what
christians
said
what
they
thought
was
little
to
the
purpose
they
might
exhort
to
peaceableness
and
passive
obedience
as
strongly
as
words
could
speak
but
what
did
they
do
what
was
their
political
position
this
is
what
statesmen
thought
of
then
as
they
do
now
what
had
men
of
the
world
to
do
with
abstract
proofs
or
first
principles
a
statesman
measures
parties
and
sects
and
writers
by
their
bearing
upon
and
he
has
a
practised
eye
in
this
sort
of
judgment
and
is
not
likely
to
be
mistaken
is
truth
said
jesting
pilate
apologies
however
eloquent
or
true
availed
nothing
with
the
roman
magistrate
against
the
sure
instinct
which
taught
him
to
dread
christianity
it
was
a
dangerous
enemy
to
any
power
not
built
upon
itself
he
felt
it
and
the
event
justified
his
apprehension
we
must
not
forget
the
character
of
the
roman
state
in
its
dealings
with
its
subjects
it
had
had
from
the
first
an
extreme
jealousy
of
secret
societies
it
was
prepared
to
grant
a
large
toleration
and
a
broad
comprehension
but
as
is
the
case
with
modern
governments
it
wished
to
have
jurisdiction
and
the
ultimate
authority
in
every
movement
of
the
body
politic
and
social
and
its
civil
institutions
were
based
or
essentially
depended
on
its
religion
accordingly
every
innovation
upon
the
established
paganism
except
it
was
allowed
by
the
law
was
rigidly
repressed
hence
the
professors
of
low
superstitions
of
mysteries
of
magic
of
astrology
were
the
outlaws
of
society
and
were
in
a
condition
analogous
if
the
comparison
may
be
allowed
to
smugglers
or
poachers
among
ourselves
or
perhaps
to
burglars
and
highwaymen
the
modern
robber
is
sometimes
made
to
ask
in
novels
or
essays
why
the
majority
of
a
people
should
bind
the
minority
and
why
he
is
amenable
to
laws
which
he
does
not
enact
but
the
magistrate
relying
on
the
power
of
the
sword
wishes
all
men
to
gain
a
living
indeed
and
to
prosper
but
only
in
his
own
legally
sanctioned
ways
and
he
hangs
or
transports
dissenters
from
his
authority
the
romans
applied
this
rule
to
religion
lardner
protests
against
application
of
the
words
contumacy
and
inflexible
obstinacy
to
the
christians
of
pontus
indeed
these
are
hard
words
he
says
very
improperly
applied
to
men
who
were
open
to
conviction
and
willing
to
satisfy
others
if
they
might
have
leave
to
speak
and
he
says
it
seems
to
me
that
pliny
acted
very
arbitrarily
and
unrighteously
in
his
treatment
of
the
christians
in
his
province
what
right
had
pliny
to
act
in
this
manner
by
what
law
or
laws
did
he
punish
them
with
death
but
the
romans
had
ever
burnt
the
sorcerer
and
banished
his
consulters
for
life
it
was
an
ancient
custom
and
at
mysteries
they
looked
with
especial
suspicion
because
since
the
established
religion
did
not
include
them
in
its
provisions
they
really
did
supply
what
may
be
called
a
demand
of
the
age
the
greeks
of
an
earlier
day
had
naturalized
among
themselves
the
eleusinian
and
other
mysteries
which
had
come
from
egypt
and
syria
and
had
little
to
fear
from
a
fresh
invasion
from
the
same
quarter
yet
even
in
greece
as
plutarch
tells
us
the
of
the
itinerants
of
cybele
and
serapis
threw
the
pythian
verses
out
of
fashion
and
henceforth
the
responses
from
the
temple
were
given
in
prose
soon
the
oracles
altogether
ceased
what
would
cause
in
the
roman
mind
still
greater
jealousy
of
christianity
was
the
general
infidelity
which
prevailed
among
all
classes
as
regards
the
mythological
fables
of
charon
cerberus
and
the
realms
of
punishment
we
know
what
opposition
had
been
made
in
rome
even
to
the
philosophy
of
greece
much
greater
would
be
the
aversion
of
constitutional
statesmen
and
lawyers
to
the
ritual
of
barbarians
religion
was
the
roman
point
of
honour
spaniards
might
rival
them
in
numbers
says
cicero
gauls
in
bodily
strength
carthaginians
in
address
greeks
in
the
arts
italians
and
latins
in
native
talent
but
the
romans
surpassed
all
nations
in
piety
and
devotion
it
was
one
of
their
laws
let
no
one
have
gods
by
himself
nor
worship
in
private
new
gods
nor
adventitious
unless
added
on
public
authority
lutatius
at
the
end
of

punic
war

forbidden
by
the
senate
to

some
years
afterwards
the
consul
took
axe
in
hand
and
commenced
the
destruction
of
the
temples
of
isis
and
serapis
in
the
second
punic
war
the
senate
had
commanded
the
surrender
of
the
or
and
any
written
art
of
sacrificing
when
a
secret
confraternity
was
discovered
at
a
later
date
the
consul
spoke
of
the
rule
of
their
ancestors
which
forbade
the
forum
circus
and
city
to
sacrificuli
and
prophets
and
burnt
their
books
in
the
next
age
banishment
was
inflicted
on

were
introducing
the
worship
of

syrian

advises
augustus
to
honour
the

according
to
the
national
custom
because
the
contempt
of

leads
to

insubordination
reception
of
foreign
laws
conspiracies
and
secret
meetings
suffer
no
one
he
adds
to
deny
the
gods
or
to
practise
sorcery
the
civilian
julius
paulus
lays
it
down
as
one
of
the
leading
principles
of
roman
law
that
those
who
introduce
new
or
untried
religions
should
be
degraded
and
if
in
the
lower
orders
put
to
death
in
like
manner
it
is
enacted
in
one
of
constantine
laws
that
the
haruspices
should
not
exercise
their
art
in
private
and
there
is
a
law
of
valentinian
against
nocturnal
sacrifices
or
magic
it
is
more
immediately
to
our
purpose
that
trajan
had
been
so
earnest
in
his
resistance
to
or
secret
societies
that
when
a
fire
had
laid
waste
nicomedia
and
pliny
proposed
to
him
to
incorporate
a
body
of
a
hundred
and
fifty
firemen
in
consequence
he
was
afraid
of
the
precedent
and
forbade
it
what
has
been
said
will
suggest
another
point
of
view
in
which
the
oriental
rites
were
obnoxious
to
the
government
as
being
vagrant
and
proselytizing
religions
if
it
tolerated
foreign
superstitions
this
would
be
on
the
ground
that
districts
or
countries
within
its
jurisdiction
held
them
to
proselytize
to
a
rite
hitherto
unknown
to
form
a
new
party
and
to
propagate
it
through
the
empire
a
religion
not
local
but
catholic
was
an
offence
against
both
order
and
reason
the
state
desired
peace
everywhere
and
no
change
considering
according
to
lactantius
that
they
were
rightly
and
deservedly
punished
who
execrated
the
public
religion
handed
down
to
them
by
their
ancestors
it
is
impossible
surely
to
deny
that
in
assembling
for
religious
purposes
the
christians
were
breaking
a
solemn
law
a
vital
principle
of
the
roman
constitution
and
this
is
the
light
in
which
their
conduct
was
regarded
by
the
historians
and
philosophers
of
the
empire
this
was
a
very
strong
act
on
the
part
of
the
disciples
of
the
great
apostle
who
had
enjoined
obedience
to
the
powers
that
be
time
after
time
they
resisted
the
authority
of
the
magistrate
and
this
is
a
phenomenon
inexplicable
on
the
theory
of
private
judgment
or
of
the
voluntary
principle
the
justification
of
such
disobedience
lies
simply
in
the
necessity
of
obeying
the
higher
authority
of
some
divine
law
but
if
christianity
were
in
its
essence
only
private
and
personal
as
so
many
now
think
there
was
no
necessity
of
their
meeting
together
at
all
if
on
the
other
hand
in
assembling
for
worship
and
holy
communion
they
were
fulfilling
an
indispensable
observance
christianity
has
imposed
a
social
law
on
the
world
and
formally
enters
the
field
of
politics
gibbon
says
that
in
consequence
of
pliny
edict
the
prudence
of
the
christians
suspended
their
agap√¶
but
it
was
for
them
to
omit
the
exercise
of
public
worship
we
can
draw
no
other
conclusion
at
the
end
of
three
hundred
years
a
more
remarkable
violation
of
law
seems
to
have
been
admitted
by
the
christian
body
it
shall
be
given
in
the
words
of
burton
he
has
been
speaking
of
maximin
edict
which
provided
for
the
restitution
of
any
of
their
lands
or
buildings
which
had
been
alienated
from
them
it
is
plain
he
says
from
the
terms
of
this
edict
that
the
christians
had
for
some
time
been
in
possession
of
property
it
speaks
of
houses
and
lands
which
did
not
belong
to
individuals
but
to
the
whole
body
their
possession
of
such
property
could
hardly
have
escaped
the
notice
of
the
government
but
it
seems
to
have
been
held
in
direct
violation
of
a
law
of
diocletian
which
prohibited
corporate
bodies
or
associations
which
were
not
legally
recognized
from
acquiring
property
the
christians
were
certainly
not
a
body
recognized
by
law
at
the
beginning
of
the
reign
of
diocletian
and
it
might
almost
be
thought
that
this
enactment
was
specially
directed
against
them
but
like
other
laws
which
are
founded
upon
tyranny
and
are
at
variance
with
the
first
principles
of
justice
it
is
probable
that
this
law
about
corporate
property
was
evaded
we
must
suppose
that
the
christians
had
purchased
lands
and
houses
before
the
law
was
passed
and
their
disregard
of
the
prohibition
may
be
taken
as
another
proof
that
their
religion
had
now
taken
so
firm
a
footing
that
the
executors
of
the
laws
were
obliged
to
connive
at
their
being
broken
by
so
numerous
a
body
no
wonder
that
the
magistrate
who
presided
at
the
martyrdom
of
romanus
calls
them
in
prudentius
a
rebel
people
that
galerius
speaks
of
them
as
a
nefarious
conspiracy
the
heathen
in
minucius
as
men
of
a
desperate
faction
that
others
make
them
guilty
of
sacrilege
and
treason
and
call
them
by
those
other
titles
which
more
closely
resembling
the
language
of
tacitus
have
been
noticed
above
hence
the
violent
accusations
against
them
as
the
destruction
of
the
empire
the
authors
of
physical
evils
and
the
cause
of
the
anger
of
the
gods
men
cry
out
says
tertullian
that
the
state
is
beset
that
the
christians
are
in
their
fields
in
their
forts
in
their
islands
they
mourn
as
for
a
loss
that
every
sex
condition
and
now
even
rank
is
going
over
to
this
sect
and
yet
they
do
not
by
this
very
means
advance
their
minds
to
the
idea
of
some
good
therein
hidden
they
allow
not
themselves
to
conjecture
more
rightly
they
choose
not
to
examine
more
closely
the
generality
run
upon
a
hatred
of
this
name
with
eyes
so
closed
that
in
bearing
favourable
testimony
to
any
one
they
mingle
with
it
the
reproach
of
the
name
good
man
caius
seius
only
he
is
a
christian
so
another
marvel
that
that
wise
man
lucius
titius
hath
suddenly
become
a
christian
no
one
reflecteth
whether
caius
be
not
therefore
good
and
lucius
wise
because
a
christian
or
therefore
a
christian
because
wise
and
good
they
praise
that
which
they
know
they
revile
that
which
they
know
not
virtue
is
not
in
such
account
as
hatred
of
the
christians
now
then
if
the
hatred
be
of
the
name
what
guilt
is
there
in
names
what
charge
against
words
unless
it
be
that
any
word
which
is
a
name
have
either
a
barbarous
or
or
a
scurrilous
or
an
immodest
sound
if
the
tiber
cometh
up

if
the

christians

forthwith
the
word
men
of
a
desperate
lawless
reckless
faction
says
the
heathen
c√¶cilius
in
the
passage
above
referred
to
who
collect
together
out
of
the
lowest
rabble
the
thoughtless
portion
and
credulous
women
seduced
by
the
weakness
of
their
sex
and
form
a
mob
of
impure
conspirators
of
whom
nocturnal
assemblies
and
solemn
fastings
and
unnatural
food
no
sacred
rite
but
pollution
is
the
bond
a
tribe
lurking
and
dumb
for
the
public
talkative
in
corners
they
despise
our
temples
as
if
graves
spit
at
our
gods
deride
our
religious
forms
pitiable
themselves
they
pity
forsooth
our
priests
themselves
they
despise
our

and
purple
monstrous
folly
and
incredible
impudence
day
after
day
their
abandoned
morals
wind
their
serpentine
course
over
the
whole
world
are
those
most
hideous
rites
of
an
impious
association
growing
into
shape
they
recognize
each
other
by
marks
and
signs
and
love
each
other
almost
before
they
recognize
promiscuous
lust
is
their
religion
thus
does
their
vain
and
mad
superstition
glory
in
crimes
the
writer
who
tells
the
story
of
a
criminal
capitally
punished
and
of
the
gibbet
of
the
cross
being
their
observance
assigns
to
them
thereby
an
altar
in
keeping
with
the
abandoned
and
wicked
that
they
may
worship
what
they
merit
why
their
mighty
effort
to
hide
and
shroud
whatever
it
is
they
worship
since
things
honest
ever
like
the
open
day
and
crimes
are
secret
why
have
they
no
altars
no
temples
no
images
known
to
us
never
speak
abroad
never
assemble
freely
were
it
not
that
what
they
worship
and
suppress
is
subject
either
of
punishment
or
of
shame
what
monstrous
what
portentous
notions
do
they
fabricate
that
that
god
of
theirs
whom
they
can
neither
show
nor
see
should
be
inquiring
diligently
into
the
characters
the

nay
the

they
would

close
at

interferes
in

places
while
he
can
neither
attend

think

meditating

to

nay
the

with
this
mad
opinion
they
add
and
append
their

wives
tales
about

after

ashes

by
some
strange
confidence

which
ye

the
answer
of
socrates
when
he
was
asked
about
heavenly
matters
is
well
known
is
above
us
does
not
concern
us
my
opinion
also
is
that
points
which
are
doubtful
as
are
the
points
in
question
must
be
left
nor
when
so
many
and
such
great
men
are
in
controversy
on
the
subject
must
judgment
be
rashly
and
audaciously
given
on
either
side
lest
the
consequence
be
either
anile
superstition
or
the
overthrow
of
all
religion
such
was
christianity
in
the
eyes
of
those
who
witnessed
its
rise
and
propagation
one
of
a
number
of
wild
and
barbarous
rites
which
were
pouring
in
upon
the
empire
from
the
ancient
realms
of
superstition
and
the
mother
of
a
progeny
of
sects
which
were
faithful
to
the
original
they
had
derived
from
egypt
or
syria
a
religion
unworthy
of
an
educated
person
as
appealing
not
to
the
intellect
but
to
the
fears
and
weaknesses
of
human
nature
and
consisting
not
in
the
rational
and
cheerful
enjoyment
but
in
a
morose
rejection
of
the
gifts
of
providence
a
horrible
religion
as
inflicting
or
enjoining
cruel
sufferings
and
monstrous
and
loathsome
in
its
very
indulgence
of
the
passions
a
religion
leading
by
reaction
to
infidelity
a
religion
of
magic
and
of
the
vulgar
arts
real
and
pretended
with
which
magic
was
accompanied
a
secret
religion
which
dared
not
face
the
day
an
itinerant
busy
proselytizing
religion
forming
an
extended
confederacy
against
the
state
resisting
its
authority
and
breaking
its
laws
there
may
be
some
exceptions
to
this
general
impression
such
as
discovery
of
the
innocent
and
virtuous
rule
of
life
adopted
by
the
christians
of
pontus
but
this
only
proves
that
christianity
was
not
in
fact
the
infamous
religion
which
the
heathen
thought
it
it
did
not
reverse
their
general
belief
to
that
effect
now
it
must
be
granted
that
in
some
respects
this
view
of
christianity
depended
on
the
times
and
would
alter
with
their
alteration
when
there
was
no
persecution
martyrs
could
not
be
obstinate
and
when
the
church
was
raised
aloft
in
high
places
it
was
no
longer
in
caves
still
i
believe
it
continued
substantially
the
same
in
the
judgment
of
the
world
external
to
it
while
there
was
an
external
world
to
judge
of
it
they
thought
it
enough
says
julian
in
the
fourth
century
of
our
lord
and
his
apostles
to
deceive
women
servants
and
slaves
and
by
their
means
wives
and
husbands
a
human
fabrication
says
he
elsewhere
put
together
by
wickedness
having
nothing
divine
in
it
but
making
a
perverted
use
of
the
childish
irrational
part
of
the
soul
and
offering
a
set
of
wonders
to
create
belief
miserable
men
he
says
elsewhere
you
refuse
to
worship
the
ancile
yet
you
worship
the
wood
of
the
cross
and
sign
it
on
your
foreheads
and
fix
it
on
your
doors
shall
one
for
this
hate
the
intelligent
among
you
or
pity
the
less
understanding
who
in
following
you
have
gone
to
such
an
excess
of
perdition
as
to
leave
the
everlasting
gods
and
go
over
to
a
dead
jew
he
speaks
of
their
adding
other
dead
men
to
him
who
died
so
long
ago
you
have
filled
all
places
with
sepulchres
and
monuments
though
it
is
nowhere
told
you
in
your
religion
to
haunt
the
tombs
and
to
attend
upon
them
elsewhere
he
speaks
of
their
leaving
the
gods
for
corpses
and
relics
on
the
other
hand
he
attributes
the
growth
of
christianity
to
its
humanity
towards
strangers
care
in
burying
the
dead
and
pretended
religiousness
of
life
in
another
place
he
speaks
of
their
care
of
the
poor
libanius
julian
preceptor
in
rhetoric
delivers
the
same
testimony
as
far
as
it
goes
he
addressed
his
oration
for
the
temples
to
a
christian
emperor
and
would
in
consequence
be
guarded
in
his
language
however
it
runs
in
one
direction
he
speaks
of
those
men
meaning
the
monks
who
eat
more
than
elephants
and
by
the
number
of
their
potations
trouble
those
who
send
them
drink
in
their
chantings
and
conceal
this
by
paleness
artificially
acquired
they
are
in
good
condition
out
of
the
misfortunes
of
others
while
they
pretend
to
serve
god
by
hunger
those
whom
they
attack
are
like
bees
they
like
drones
i
do
not
quote
this
passage
to
prove
that
there
were
monks
in
libanius
days
which
no
one
doubts
but
to
show
his
impression
of
christianity
as
far
as
his
works
betray
it
numantian
in
the
same
century
describes
in
verse
his
voyage
from
rome
to
gaul
one
book
of
the
poem
is
extant
he
falls
in
with
christianity
on
two
of
the
islands
which
lie
in
his
course
he
thus
describes
them
as
found
on
one
of
these
the
island
is
in
a
squalid
state
being
full
of
they
call
themselves
monks
because
they
wish
to
live
alone
without
witness
they
dread
the
gifts
from
fearing
the
reverses
of
fortune
thus
homer
says
that
melancholy
was
the
cause
of
bellerophon
anxiety
for
it
is
said
that
after
the
wounds
of
grief
mankind
displeased
the
offended
youth
he
meets
on
the
other
island
a
christian
whom
he
had
known
of
good
family
and
fortune
and
happy
in
his
marriage
who
impelled
by
the
furies
had
left
men
and
gods
and
credulous
exile
was
living
in
base
concealment
is
not
this
herd
he
continues
worse
than
circean
poison
then
bodies
were
changed
now
minds
in
the
philopatris
which
is
the
work
of
an
author
of
the
fourth
century
critias
is
introduced
pale
and
wild
his
friend
asks
him
if
he
has
seen
cerberus
or
hecate
and
he
answers
that
he
has
heard
a
rigmarole
from
certain
sophists
which
he
thinks
would
drive
him
mad
if
he
heard
it
again
and
was
nearly
sending
him
headlong
over
some
cliff
as
it
was
he
retires
for
relief
with
his
inquirer
to
a
pleasant
place
shadowed
by
planes
where
swallows
and
nightingales
are
singing
and
a
quiet
brook
is
purling
triephon
his
friend
expresses
a
fear
lest
he
has
heard
some
incantation
and
is
led
by
the
course
of
the
dialogue
before
his
friend
tells
his
tale
to
give
some
account
of
christianity
being
himself
a
christian
after
speaking
of
the
creation
as
described
by
moses
he
falls
at
once
upon
that
doctrine
of
a
particular
providence
which
is
so
distasteful
to
plutarch
velleius
in
cicero
and
c√¶cilius
and
generally
to
unbelievers
he
is
in
heaven
he
says
looking
at
just
and
unjust
and
causing
actions
to
be
entered
in
books
and
he
will
recompense
all
on
a
day
which
he
has
appointed
critias
objects
that
he
can
not
make
this
consistent
with
the
received
doctrine
about
the
fates
even
though
he
has
perhaps
been
carried
aloft
with
his
master
and
initiated
in
unspeakable
mysteries
he
also
asks
if
the
deeds
of
the
scythians
are
written
in
heaven
for
if
so
there
must
be
many
scribes
there
after
some
more
words
in
course
of
which
as
in
the
earlier
part
of
the
dialogue
the
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
is
introduced
critias
gives
an
account
of
what
befell
him
he
says
he
fell
in
with
a
crowd
in
the
streets
and
while
asking
a
friend
the
cause
of
it
others
joined
them
christians
or
monks
and
a
conversation
ensues
part
of
it
corrupt
or
obscure
on
the
subject
as
gesner
supposes
of
julian
oppression
of
the
christians
especially
of
the
clergy
one
of
these
interlocutors
is
a
wretched
old
man
whose
phlegm
is
paler
than
death
another
has
a
rotten
cloke
on
and
no
covering
on
head
or
feet
who
says
he
has
been
told
by
some
person
from
the
mountains
with
a
shorn
crown
that
in
the
theatre
was
a
name
hieroglyphically
written
of
one
who
would
flood
the
highway
with
gold
on
his
laughing
at
the
story
his
friend
crato
whom
he
had
joined
bids
him
be
silent
using
a
pythagorean
word
for
he
has
most
excellent
matters
to
initiate
him
into
and
that
the
prediction
is
no
dream
but
true
and
will
be
fulfilled
in
august
using
the
egyptian

to

still
they
frown

tell

will

and
he
goes
on
to

upon

on

this

ye

if
divinations

have
seduced
you
double
is
your
stupidity
for
they
are
the
discoveries
of
old
women
and
things
to
laugh
at
the
interview
then
draws
to
an
end
but
more
than
enough
has
been
quoted
already
to
show
the
author
notion
of
christianity
such
was
the
language
of
paganism
after
christianity
had
for
fifty
years
been
exposed
to
the
public
gaze
after
it
had
been
before
the
world
for
fifty
more
augustine
had
still
to
defend
it
against
the
charge
of
being
the
cause
of
the
calamities
of
the
empire
and
for
the
charge
of
magic
when
the
arian
bishops
were
in
formal
disputations
with
the
catholic
before
gungebald
burgundian
king
of
france
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
we
find
still
that
they
charged
the
catholics
with
being
and
worshipping
a
number
of
gods
and
when
the
catholics
proposed
that
the
king
should
repair
to
the
shrine
of
justus
where
both
parties
might
ask
him
concerning
their
respective
faiths
the
arians
cried
out
that
they
would
not
seek
enchantments
like
saul
for
scripture
was
enough
for
them
which
was
more
powerful
than
all
bewitchments
this
was
said
not
against
strangers
of
whom
they
knew
nothing
as
ethelbert
might
be
suspicious
of
augustine
and
his
brother
missionaries
but
against
a
body
of
men
who
lived
among
them
i
do
not
think
it
can
be
doubted
then
that
had
tacitus
suetonius
and
pliny
celsus
porphyry
and
the
other
opponents
of
christianity
lived
in
the
fourth
century
their
evidence
concerning
christianity
would
be
very
much
the
same
as
it
has
come
down
to
us
from
the
centuries
before
it
in
either
case
a
man
of
the
world
and
a
philosopher
would
have
been
disgusted
at
the
gloom
and
sadness
of
its
profession
its
mysteriousness
its
claim
of
miracles
the
want
of
good
sense
imputable
to
its
rule
of
life
and
the
unsettlement
and
discord
it
was
introducing
into
the
social
and
political
world
on
the
whole
then
i
conclude
as
follows
if
there
is
a
form
of
christianity
now
in
the
world
which
is
accused
of
gross
superstition
of
borrowing
its
rites
and
customs
from
the
heathen
and
of
ascribing
to
forms
and
ceremonies
an
occult
virtue
a
religion
which
is
considered
to
burden
and
enslave
the
mind
by
its
requisitions
to
address
itself
to
the
and
ignorant
to
be
supported
by
sophistry
and
imposture
and
to
contradict
reason
and
exalt
mere
irrational
faith
a
religion
which
impresses
on
the
serious
mind
very
distressing
views
of
the
guilt
and
consequences
of
sin
sets
upon
the
minute
acts
of
the
day
one
by
one
their
definite
value
for
praise
or
blame
and
thus
casts
a
grave
shadow
over
the
future
a
religion
which
holds
up
to
admiration
the
surrender
of
wealth
and
disables
serious
persons
from
enjoying
it
if
they
would
a
religion
the
doctrines
of
which
be
they
good
or
bad
are
to
the
generality
of
men
unknown
which
is
considered
to
bear
on
its
very
surface
signs
of
folly
and
falsehood
so
distinct
that
a
glance
suffices
to
judge
of
it
and
that
careful
examination
is
preposterous
which
is
felt
to
be
so
simply
bad
that
it
may
be
calumniated
at
hazard
and
at
pleasure
it
being
nothing
but
absurdity
to
stand
upon
the
accurate
distribution
of
its
guilt
among
its
particular
acts
or
painfully
to
determine
how
far
this
or
that
story
concerning
it
is
literally
true
or
what
has
to
be
allowed
in
candour
or
what
is
improbable
or
what
cuts
two
ways
or
what
is
not
proved
or
what
may
be
plausibly
defended
a
religion
such
that
men
look
at
a
convert
to
it
with
a
feeling
which
no
other
denomination
raises
except
judaism
socialism
or
mormonism
viz
with
curiosity
suspicion
fear
disgust
as
the
case
may
be
as
if
something
strange
had
befallen
him
as
if
he
had
had
an
initiation
into
a
mystery
and
had
come
into
communion
with
dreadful
influences
as
if
he
were
now
one
of
a
confederacy
which
claimed
him
absorbed
him
stripped
him
of
his
personality
reduced
him
to
a
mere
organ
or
instrument
of
a
whole
a
religion
which
men
hate
as
proselytizing
revolutionary
as
dividing
families
separating
chief
friends
corrupting
the
maxims
of
government
making
a
mock
at
law
dissolving
the
empire
the
enemy
of
human
nature
and
a
conspirator
against
its
rights
and
privileges
a
religion
which
they
consider
the
champion
and
instrument
of
darkness
and
a
pollution
calling
down
upon
the
land
the
anger
of
heaven
a
religion
which
they
associate
with
intrigue
and
conspiracy
which
they
speak
about
in
whispers
which
they
detect
by
anticipation
in
whatever
goes
wrong
and
to
which
they
impute
whatever
is
unaccountable
a
religion
the
very
name
of
which
they
cast
out
as
evil
and
use
simply
as
a
bad
epithet
and
which
from
the
impulse
of
they
would
persecute
if
they
could
if
there
be
such
a
religion
now
in
the
world
it
is
not
unlike
christianity
as
that
same
world
viewed
it
when
first
it
came
forth
from
its
divine
author
section
ii
the
church
of
the
fourth
century
till
the
imperial
government
had
become
christian
and
heresies
were
put
down
by
the
arm
of
power
the
face
of
christendom
presented
much
the
same
appearance
all
along
as
on
the
first
propagation
of
the
religion
what
gnosticism
montanism
judaism
and
i
may
add
the
oriental
mysteries
were
to
the
nascent
church
as
described
in
the
foregoing
section
such
were
the
manichean
donatist
apollinarian
and
contemporary
sects
afterwards
the
church
in
each
place
looked
at
first
sight
as
but
one
out
of
a
number
of
religious
communions
with
little
of
a
very
distinctive
character
except
to
the
careful
inquirer
still
there
were
external
indications
of
essential
differences
within
and
as
we
have
already
compared
it
in
the
first
centuries
we
may
now
contrast
it
in
the
fourth
with
the
rival
religious
bodies
with
which
it
was
encompassed
how
was
the
man
to
guide
his
course
who
wished
to
join
himself
to
the
doctrine
and
fellowship
of
the
apostles
in
the
times
of
athanasius
st
basil
and
augustine
few
indeed
were
the
districts
in
the
which
did
not
then
as
in
the
era
present
a
number
of
creeds
and
communions
for
his
choice
gaul
indeed
is
said
at
that
era
to
have
been
perfectly
free
from
heresies
at
least
none
are
mentioned
as
belonging
to
that
country
in
the
theodosian
code
but
in
egypt
in
the
early
part
of
the
fourth
century
the
meletian
schism
numbered
as
many
bishops
as
were
contained
in
the
whole
patriarchate
in
africa
towards
the
end
of
it
while
the
catholic
bishops
amounted
in
all
to
the
donatists
rivalled
them
with
as
many
as
in
spain
priscillianism
was
spread
from
the
pyrenees
to
the
ocean
it
seems
to
have
been
the
religion
of
the
population
in
the
province
of
gallicia
while
its
author
priscillian
whose
death
had
been
contrived
by
the
ithacians
was
honoured
as
a
martyr
the
manichees
hiding
themselves
under
a
variety
of
names
in
different
localities
were
not
in
the
least
flourishing
condition
at
rome
rome
and
italy
were
the
seat
of
the
marcionites
the
origenists
too
are
mentioned
by
jerome
as
bringing
a
cargo
of
blasphemies
into
the
port
of
rome
and
rome
was
the
seat
of
a
novatian
a
donatist
and
a
luciferian
bishop
in
addition
to
the
legitimate
occupant
of
the
see
of
peter
the
luciferians
as
was
natural
under
the
circumstances
of
their
schism
were
sprinkled
over
christendom
from
spain
to
palestine
and
from
treves
to
lybia
while
in
its
parent
country
sardinia
as
a
centre
of
that
extended
range
lucifer
seems
to
have
received
the
honours
of
a
saint
when
gregory
nazianzen
began
to
preach
at
constantinople
the
arians
were
in
possession
of
its
hundred
churches
they
had
the
populace
in
their
favour
and
after
their
legal
dislodgment
edict
after
edict
was
ineffectually
issued
against
them
the
novatians
too
abounded
there
and
the
sabbatians
who
had
separated
from
them
had
a
church
where
they
prayed
at
the
tomb
of
their
founder
moreover
apollinarians
eunomians
and
mustered
in
great
numbers
at
constantinople
the
bishops
were
as
popular
in
the
neighbouring
provinces
as
the
arian
doctrine
in
the
capital
they
had
possession
of
the
coast
of
the
hellespont
and
bithynia
and
were
found
in
phrygia
isauria
and
the
neighbouring
parts
of
asia
minor
phrygia
was
the
headquarters
of
the
montanists
and
was
overrun
by
the
messalians
who
had
advanced
thus
far
from
mesopotamia
spreading
through
syria
lycaonia
pamphylia
and
cappadocia
in
their
way
in
the
lesser
armenia
the
same
heretics
had
penetrated
into
the
monasteries
phrygia
too
and
paphlagonia
were
the
seat
of
the
novatians
who
besides
were
in
force
at
nic√¶a
and
nicomedia
were
found
in
alexandria
africa
and
spain
and
had
a
bishop
even
in
scythia
the
whole
tract
of
country
from
the
hellespont
to
cilicia
had
nearly
lapsed
into
eunomianism
and
the
tract
from
cilicia
as
far
as
ph≈ìnicia
into
apollinarianism
the
disorders
of
the
church
of
antioch
are
well
known
an
arian
succession
two
orthodox
claimants
and
a
bishop
of
the
apollinarians
palestine
abounded
in
origenists
if
at
that
time
they
may
properly
be
called
a
sect
palestine
egypt
and
arabia
were
overrun
with
marcionites
osrhoene
was
occupied
by
the
followers
of
bardesanes
and
harmonius
whose
hymns
so
nearly
took
the
place
of
national
tunes
that
ephrem
found
no
better
way
of
resisting
the
heresy
than
setting
them
to
fresh
words
theodoret
in
comagene
speaks
in
the
next
century
of
reclaiming
eight
villages
of
marcionites
one
of
eunomians
and
one
of
arians
these
sects
were
of
very
various
character
learning
eloquence
and
talent
were
the
characteristics
of
the
apollinarians
manichees
and
pelagians
tichonius
the
donatist
was
distinguished
in
biblical
interpretation
the
and
apollinarian
leaders
were
men
of
grave
and
correct
behaviour
the
novatians
had
sided
with
the
orthodox
during
the
arian
persecution
the
montanists
and
messalians
addressed
themselves
to
an
almost
heathen
population
the
atrocious
fanaticism
of
the
priscillianists
the
fury
of
the
arian
women
of
alexandria
and
constantinople
and
the
savage
cruelty
of
the
circumcellions
can
hardly
be
exaggerated
these
various
sectaries
had
their
orders
of
clergy
bishops
priests
and
deacons
their
readers
and
ministers
their
celebrants
and
altars
their
hymns
and
litanies
they
preached
to
the
crowds
in
public
and
their
bore
the
semblance
of
churches
they
had
their
sacristies
and
cemeteries
their
farms
their
professors
and
doctors
their
schools
miracles
were
ascribed
to
the
arian
theophilus
to
the
luciferian
gregory
of
elvira
to
a
macedonian
in
cyzicus
and
to
the
donatists
in
africa
how
was
an
individual
inquirer
to
find
or
a
private
christian
to
keep
the
truth
amid
so
many
rival
teachers
the
misfortunes
or
perils
of
holy
men
and
saints
show
us
the
difficulty
augustine
was
nine
years
a
manichee
st
basil
for
a
time
was
in
admiration
of
the
sulpicius
gave
a
momentary
countenance
to
the
pelagians
paula
listened
and
melania
assented
to
the
origenists
yet
the
rule
was
simple
which
would
direct
every
one
right
and
in
that
age
at
least
no
one
could
be
wrong
for
any
long
time
without
his
own
fault
the
church
is
everywhere
but
it
is
one
sects
are
everywhere
but
they
are
many
independent
and
discordant
catholicity
is
the
attribute
of
the
church
independency
of
sectaries
it
is
true
that
some
sects
might
seem
almost
catholic
in
their
diffusion
novatians
or
marcionites
were
in
all
quarters
of
the
empire
yet
it
is
hardly
more
than
the
name
or
the
general
doctrine
or
philosophy
that
was
universal
the
different
portions
which
professed
it
seem
to
have
been
bound
together
by
no
strict
or
definite
tie
the
church
might
be
evanescent
or
lost
for
a
while
in
particular
countries
or
it
might
be
levelled
and
buried
among
sects
when
the
eye
was
confined
to
one
spot
or
it
might
be
confronted
by
the
one
and
same
heresy
in
various
places
but
on
looking
round
the
there
was
no
mistaking
that
body
which
and
which
alone
had
possession
of
it
the
church
is
a
kingdom
a
heresy
is
a
family
rather
than
a
kingdom
and
as
a
family
continually
divides
and
sends
out
branches
founding
new
houses
and
propagating
itself
in
colonies
each
of
them
as
independent
as
its
original
head
so
was
it
with
heresy
simon
magus
the
first
heretic
had
been
patriarch
of
menandrians
basilidians
valentinians
and
the
whole
family
of
gnostics
tatian
of
encratites
severians
aquarians
apotactites
and
saccophori
the
montanists
had
been
propagated
into
tascodrugites
pepuzians
artotyrites
and
quartodecimans
eutyches
in
a
later
time
gave
birth
to
the
dioscorians
gaianites
theodosians
agnoet√¶
theopaschites
acephali
semidalit√¶
nagranit√¶
jacobites
and
others
this
is
the
uniform
history
of
heresy
the
patronage
of
the
civil
power
might
for
a
time
counteract
the
law
of
its
nature
but
it
showed
it
as
soon
as
that
obstacle
was
removed
scarcely
was
arianism
deprived
of
the
churches
of
constantinople
and
left
to
itself
than
it
split
in
that
very
city
into
the
dorotheans
the
psathyrians
and
the
curtians
and
the
eunomians
into
the
theophronians
and
eutychians
one
fourth
part
of
the
donatists
speedily
became
maximinianists
and
besides
these
were
the
rogatians
the
primianists
the
urbanists
and
the
claudianists
if
such
was
the
fecundity
of
the
heretical
principle
in
one
place
it
is
not
to
be
supposed
that
novatians
or
marcionites
in
africa
or
the
east
would
feel
themselves
bound
to
think
or
to
act
with
their
of
rome
or
constantinople
and
the
great
varieties
or
inconsistencies
of
statement
which
have
come
down
to
us
concerning
the
tenets
of
heresies
may
thus
be
explained
this
had
been
the
case
with
the
pagan
rites
whether
indigenous
or
itinerant
to
which
heresy
succeeded
the
established
priesthoods
were
local
properties
as
independent
theologically
as
they
were
geographically
of
each
other
the
fanatical
companies
which
spread
over
the
empire
dissolved
and
formed
again
as
the
circumstances
of
the
moment
occasioned
so
was
it
with
heresy
it
was
by
its
very
nature
its
own
master
free
to
change
and
having
thrown
off
the
yoke
of
the
church
it
was
little
likely
to
submit
to
any
usurped
and
spurious
authority
montanism
and
manicheeism
might
perhaps
in
some
sort
furnish
an
exception
to
this
remark
in
one
point
alone
the
heresies
seem
universally
to
have
agreed
in
hatred
to
the
church
this
might
at
that
time
be
considered
one
of
her
surest
and
most
obvious
notes
she
was
that
body
of
which
all
sects
however
divided
among
themselves
spoke
ill
according
to
the
prophecy
if
they
have
called
the
master
of
the
house
beelzebub
how
much
more
them
of
his
household
they
disliked
and
they
feared
her
they
did
their
utmost
to
overcome
their
mutual
differences
in
order
to
unite
against
her
their
utmost
indeed
was
little
for
independency
was
the
law
of
their
being
they
could
not
exert
themselves
without
fresh
quarrels
both
in
the
bosom
of
each
and
one
with
another
h√¶reticorum
pax
est
had
become
a
proverb
but
they
felt
the
great
desirableness
of
union
against
the
only
body
which
was
the
natural
antagonist
of
all
and
various
are
the
instances
which
occur
in
ecclesiastical
history
of
attempted
coalitions
the
meletians
of
africa
united
with
the
arians
against
athanasius
the
of
the
council
of
sardica
corresponded
with
the
donatists
of
africa
nestorius
received
and
protected
the
pelagians
aspar
the
arian
minister
of
leo
the
emperor
favoured
the
monophysites
of
egypt
the
jacobites
of
egypt
sided
with
the
moslem
who
are
charged
with
holding
a
nestorian
doctrine
it
had
been
so
from
the
beginning
they
huddle
up
a
peace
with
all
everywhere
says
tertullian
for
it
maketh
no
matter
to
them
although
they
hold
different
doctrines
so
long
as
they
conspire
together
in
their
siege
against
the
one
thing
truth
and
even
though
active
was
impracticable
at
least
hard
words
cost
nothing
and
could
express
that
common
hatred
at
all
seasons
accordingly
by
montanists
catholics
were
called
the
carnal
by
novatians
the
apostates
by
valentinians
the
worldly
by
manichees
the

and

and

of
antichrist
and
peter
chair
the
seat
of
pestilence
and
by
the
luciferians
the
church
was
called
a
brothel
the
devil
harlot
and
synagogue
of
satan
so
that
it
might
be
called
a
note
of
the
church
as
i
have
said
for
the
use
of
the
most
busy
and
the
most
ignorant
that
she
was
on
one
side
and
all
other
bodies
on
the
other
yet
strange
as
it
may
appear
there
was
one
title
of
the
church
of
a
very
different
nature
from
those
which
have
been
enumerated
a
title
of
honour
which
all
men
agreed
to
give
her
and
one
which
furnished
a
still
more
simple
direction
than
such
epithets
of
abuse
to
aid
the
busy
and
the
ignorant
in
finding
her
and
which
was
used
by
the
fathers
for
that
purpose
it
was
one
which
the
sects
could
neither
claim
for
themselves
nor
hinder
being
enjoyed
by
its
rightful
owner
though
since
it
was
the
characteristic
designation
of
the
church
in
the
creed
it
seemed
to
surrender
the
whole
controversy
between
the
two
parties
engaged
in
it
balaam
could
not
keep
from
blessing
the
ancient
people
of
god
and
the
whole
world
heresies
inclusive
were
irresistibly
constrained
to
call
god
second
election
by
its
prophetical
title
of
the
catholic
church
paul
tells
us
that
the
heretic
is
condemned
by
himself
and
no
clearer
witness
against
the
sects
of
the
earlier
centuries
was
needed
by
the
church
than
their
own
testimony
to
this
contrast
between
her
actual
position
and
their
own
sects
say
the
fathers
are
called
after
the
name
of
their
founders
or
from
their
locality
or
from
their
doctrine
so
was
it
from
the
beginning
i
am
of
paul
and
i
of
apollos
and
i
of
cephas
but
it
was
promised
to
the
church
that
she
should
have
no
master
upon
earth
and
that
she
should
gather
together
in
one
the
children
of
god
that
were
scattered
abroad
her
name
which
was
understood
in
the
marketplace
and
used
in
the
palace
which
every
chance
comer
knew
and
which
recognized
was
the
catholic
church
this
was
that
very
description
of
christianity
in
those
times
which
we
are
all
along
engaged
in
determining
and
it
had
been
recognized
as
such
from
the
first
the
name
or
the
fact
is
put
forth
by
ignatius
justin
clement
by
the
church
of
smyrna
iren√¶us
rhodon
or
another
tertullian
origen
cyprian
cornelius
by
the
martyrs
pionius
sabina
and
asclepiades
by
lactantius
eusebius
adimantius
athanasius
pacian
optatus
epiphanius
cyril
st
basil
ambrose
chrysostom
jerome
augustine
and
facundus
clement
uses
it
as
an
argument
against
the
gnostics
augustine
against
the
donatists
and
manichees
jerome
against
the
luciferians
and
pacian
against
the
novatians
it
was
an
argument
for
educated
and
simple
when
ambrose
would
convert
the
cultivated
reason
of
augustine
he
bade
him
study
the
book
of
isaiah
who
is
the
prophet
as
of
the
messiah
so
of
the
calling
of
the
gentiles
and
of
the
imperial
power
of
the
church
and
when
cyril
would
give
a
rule
to
his
crowd
of
catechumens
if
ever
thou
art
sojourning
in
any
city
he
says
inquire
not
simply
where
the
house
is
for
the
sects
of
the
profane
also
make
an
attempt
to
call
their
own
dens
houses
of
the
lord
nor
merely
where
the
church
is
but
where
is
the
catholic
church
for
this
is
the
peculiar
name
of
this
holy
body
the
mother
of
us
all
which
is
the
spouse
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
in
the
catholic
church
says
augustine
to
the
manichees
not
to
speak
of
that
most
pure
wisdom
to
the
knowledge
of
which
few
spiritual
men
attain
in
this
life
so
as
to
know
it
even
in
its
least
measure
as
men
indeed
yet
without
any
doubt
for
the
multitude
of
christians
are
safest
not
in
understanding
with
quickness
but
in
believing
with
simplicity
not
to
speak
of
this
wisdom
which
ye
do
not
believe
to
be
in
the
catholic
church
there
are
many
other
considerations
which
most
sufficiently
hold
me
in
her
bosom
i
am
held
by
the
consent
of
people
and
nations
by
that
authority
which
began
in
miracles
was
nourished
in
hope
was
increased
by
charity
and
made
steadfast
by
age
by
that
succession
of
priests
from
the
chair
of
the
apostle
peter
to
whose
feeding
the
lord
after
his
resurrection
commended
his
sheep
even
to
the
present
episcopate
lastly
by
the
very
title
of
catholic
which
not
without
cause
hath
this
church
alone
amid
so
many
heresies
obtained
in
such
sort
that
whereas
all
heretics
wish
to
be
called
catholics
nevertheless
to
any
stranger
who
asked
where
to
find
the
church
none
of
them
would
dare
to
point
to
his
own
basilica
or
home
these
dearest
bonds
then
of
the
christian
name
so
many
and
such
rightly
hold
a
man
in
belief
in
the
catholic
church
even
though
by
reason
of
the
slowness
of
our
understanding
or
our
deserts
truth
doth
not
yet
show
herself
in
her
clearest
tokens
but
among
you
who
have
none
of
these
reasons
to
invite
and
detain
me
i
hear
but
the
loud
sound
of
a
promise
of
the
truth
which
truth
verily
if
it
be
so
manifestly
displayed
among
you
that
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
it
is
to
be
preferred
to
all
those
things
by
which
i
am
held
in
the
catholic
church
but
if
it
is
promised
alone
and
not
exhibited
no
one
shall
move
me
from
that
faith
which
by
so
many
and
great
ties
binds
my
mind
to
the
christian
religion
when
adimantius
asked
his
marcionite
opponent
how
he
was
a
christian
who
did
not
even
bear
that
name
but
was
called
from
marcion
he
retorts
and
you
are
called
from
the
catholic
church
therefore
ye
are
not
christians
either
adimantius
answers
did
we
profess
man
name
you
would
have
spoken
to
the
point
but
if
we
are
called
from
being
all
over
the
world
what
is
there
bad
in
this
whereas
there
is
one
god
and
one
lord
says
clement
therefore
also
that
which
is
the
highest
in
esteem
is
praised
on
the
score
of
being
sole
as
after
the
pattern
of
the
one
principle
in
the
nature
then
of
the
one
the
church
which
is
one
hath
its
portion
which
they
would
forcibly
cut
up
into
many
heresies
in
substance
then
and
in
idea
and
in
first
principle
and
in
we
call
the
ancient
catholic
church
sole
in
order
to
the
unity
of
one
faith
the
faith
according
to
her
own
covenants
or
rather
that
one
covenant
in
different
times
which
by
the
will
of
one
god
and
through
one
lord
is
gathering
together
those
who
are
already
ordained
whom
god
hath
predestined
having
known
that
they
would
be
just
from
the
foundation
of
the
world
but
of
heresies
some
are
called
from
a
man
name
as
valentine
heresy
marcion
and
that
of
basilides
though
they
profess
to
bring
the
opinion
of
matthias
for
all
the
apostles
had
as
one
teaching
so
one
tradition
and
others
from
place
as
the
peratici
and
others
from
nation
as
that
of
the
phrygians
and
others
from
their
actions
as
that
of
the
encratites
and
others
from
their
peculiar
doctrines
as
the
docet√¶
and
hematites
and
others
from
their
hypotheses
and
what
they
have
honoured
as
cainites
and
the
ophites
and
others
from
their
wicked
conduct
and
enormities
as
those
simonians
who
are
called
eutychites
there
are
and
there
have
been
says
justin
many
who
have
taught
atheistic
and
blasphemous
words
and
deeds
coming
in
the
name
of
jesus
and
they
are
called
by
us
from
the
appellation
of
the
men
whence
each
doctrine
and
opinion
began
some
are
called
marcians
others
valentinians
others
basilidians
others
saturnilians
when
men
are
called
phrygians
or
novatians
or
valentinians
or
marcionites
or
anthropians
says
lactantius
or
by
any
other
name
they
cease
to
be
christians
for
they
have
lost
christ
name
and
clothe
themselves
in
human
and
foreign
titles
it
is
the
catholic
church
alone
which
retains
the
true
worship
we
never
heard
of
petrines
or
paulines
or
bartholomeans
or
thaddeans
says
epiphanius
but
from
the
first
there
was
one
preaching
of
all
the
apostles
not
preaching
themselves
but
christ
jesus
the
lord
wherefore
also
all
gave
one
name
to
the
church
not
their
own
but
that
of
their
lord
jesus
christ
since
they
began
to
be
called
christians
first
at
antioch
which
is
the
sole
catholic
church
having
nought
else
but
christ
being
a
church
of
christians
not
of
christs
but
of
christians
he
being
one
they
from
that
one
being
called
christians
none
but
this
church
and
her
preachers
are
of
this
character
as
is
shown
by
their
own
epithets
manicheans
and
simonians
and
valentinians
and
ebionites
if
you
ever
hear
those
who
are
said
to
belong
to
christ
says
jerome
named
not
from
the
lord
jesus
christ
but
from
some
other
say
marcionites
valentinians
mountaineers
campestrians
know
that
it
is
not
christ
church
but
the
synagogue
of
antichrist
pacian
letters
to
the
novatian
bishop
sympronian
require
a
more
extended
notice
the
latter
had
required
the
catholic
faith
to
be
proved
to
him
without
distinctly
stating
from
what
portion
of
it
he
dissented
and
he
boasted
that
he
had
never
found
any
one
to
convince
him
of
its
truth
pacian
observes
that
there
is
one
point
which
sympronian
can
not
dispute
and
which
settles
the
question
the
very
name
catholic
he
then
supposes
sympronian
to
object
that
under
the
apostles
no
one
was
called
catholic
he
answers
be
it
thus
it
shall
have
been
so
allow
even
that
when
after
the
apostles
heresies
had
burst
forth
and
were
striving
under
various
names
to
tear
piecemeal
and
divide
dove
and
queen
of
god
did
not
the
apostolic
people
require
a
name
of
their
own
whereby
to
mark
the
unity
of
the
people
that
was
uncorrupted
lest
the
error
of
some
should
rend
limb
by
limb
undefiled
virgin
of
god
was
it
not
seemly
that
the
chief
head
should
be
distinguished
by
its
own
peculiar
appellation
suppose
this
very
day
i
entered
a
populous
city
when
i
had
found
marcionites
apollinarians
cataphrygians
novatians
and
others
of
the
kind
who
call
themselves
christians
by
what
name
should
i
recognize
the
congregation
of
my
own
people
unless
it
were
named
catholic
whence
was
it
delivered
to
me
certainly
that
which
has
stood
through
so
many
ages
was
not
borrowed
from
man
this
name
sounds
not
of
marcion
nor
of
apelles
nor
of
montanus
nor
does
it
take
heretics
for
its
authors
in
his
second
letter
he
continues
certainly
that
was
no
accessory
name
which
endured
through
so
many
ages
and
indeed
i
am
glad
for
thee
that
although
thou
mayest
have
preferred
others
yet
thou
agreest
that
the
name
attaches
to
us
which
should
you
deny
nature
would
cry
out
but
and
if
you
still
have
doubts
let
us
hold
our
peace
we
will
both
be
that
which
we
shall
be
named
after
alluding
to
remark
that
though
cyprian
was
holy
his
people
bear
the
name
of
apostaticum
capitolinum
or
synedrium
which
were
some
of
the
novatian
titles
of
the
church
pacian
replies
ask
a
century
brother
and
all
its
years
in
succession
whether
this
name
has
adhered
to
us
whether
the
people
of
cyprian
have
been
called
other
than
catholic
no
one
of
these
names
have
i
ever
heard
it
followed
that
such
appellations
were
taunts
not
names
and
therefore
unmannerly
on
the
other
hand
it
seems
that
sympronian
did
not
like
to
be
called
a
novatian
though
he
could
not
call
himself
a
catholic
tell
me
yourselves
says
pacian
what
ye
are
called
do
ye
deny
that
the
novatians
are
called
from
novatian
impose
on
them
whatever
name
you
like
that
will
ever
adhere
to
them
search
if
you
please
whole
annals
and
trust
so
many
ages
you
will
answer
but
if
i
inquire
the
genus
of
the
sect
you
will
not
deny
that
it
is
novatian
confess
it
without
deceit
there
is
no
wickedness
in
the
name
why
when
so
often
inquired
for
do
you
hide
yourself
why
ashamed
of
the
origin
of
your
name
when
you
first
wrote
i
thought
you
a
cataphrygian
dost
thou
grudge
me
my
name
and
yet
shun
thine
own
think
what
there
is
of
shame
in
a
cause
which
shrinks
from
its
own
name
in
a
third
letter
church
is
the
body
of
christ
truly
the
body
not
a
member
the
body
composed
of
many
parts
and
members
knit
in
one
as
saith
the
apostle
the
body
is
not
one
member
but
many
therefore
the
church
is
the
full
body
compacted
and
diffused
now
throughout
the
whole
world
like
a
city
i
mean
all
whose
parts
are
united
not
as
ye
are
o
novatians
some
small
and
insolent
portion
and
a
mere
swelling
that
has
gathered
and
separated
from
the
rest
of
the
body
great
is
the
progeny
of
the
virgin
and
without
number
her
offspring
wherewith
the
whole
world
is
filled
wherewith
the
populous
swarms
ever
throng
the
circumfluous
hive
and
he
founds
this
characteristic
of
the
church
upon
the
prophecies
at
length
brother
sympronian
be
not
ashamed
to
be
with
the
many
at
length
consent
to
despise
these
festering
spots
of
the
novatians
and
these
parings
of
yours
and
at
length
to
look
upon
the
flocks
of
the
catholics
and
the
people
of
the
church
extending
so
far
and
wide
hear
what
david
saith
will
sing
unto
thy
name
in
the
great
congregation
and
again
will
praise
thee
among
much
people
and
lord
even
the
most
mighty
god
hath
spoken
and
called
the
world
from
the
rising
up
of
the
sun
unto
the
going
down
thereof
what
shall
the
seed
of
abraham
which
is
as
the
stars
and
the
sand
on
the

i

of

concerning
the
church
in
those
early
times
or
what
were
the
promises
made
to
it
in

but
simply
ascertaining
what
in
matter
of
fact
was
its
then
condition
relatively
to
the
various
christian
bodies
among
which
it
was
found
that
the

were
able
to
put
forward

certain
doctrine
that
they
were
able
to
appeal
to
the
prophecies
proves
that
matter
of
fact
for
unless
the

and
the

alone
had
been

they
could
not
have
argued
on
the
supposition
that
it
was
so
and
so
as
to
the

catholic
it
is
enough
that
the
church
was
so
called
that
title
was
a
confirmatory
proof
and
symbol
of
what
is
even
otherwise
so
plain
that
she
as
pacian
explains
the
word
was
everywhere
one
while
the
sects
of
the
day
were
nowhere
one
but
everywhere
divided
sects
might
indeed
be
everywhere
but
they
were
in
no
two
places
the
same
every
spot
had
its
own
independent
communion
or
at

to
this
result
they
were
inevitably

continually
tending
pacian
writes
in

the
same
contrast
between
the
church
and
sectarianism
is
presented
to
us
in
africa
in
the
instance
of
the
donatists
and
optatus
is
a
witness
both
to
the
fact
and
to
its
notoriety
and
to
the
deep
impressions
which
it
made
on
all
parties
whether
or
not
the
donatists
identified
themselves
with
the
true
church
and
cut
off
the
rest
of
christendom
from
it
is
not
the
question
here
nor
alters
the
fact
which
i
wish
distinctly
brought
out
and
recognized
that
in
those
ancient
times
the
church
was
that
body
which
was
spread
over
the
and
sects
were
those
bodies
which
were
local
or
transitory
what
is
that
one
church
says
optatus
which
christ
calls
and
it
can
not
be
in
the
multitude
of
heretics
and
schismatics
if
so
it
follows
that
it
is
but
in
one
place
thou
brother
parmenian
hast
said
that
it
is
with
you
alone
unless
perhaps
you
aim
at
claiming
for
yourselves
a
special
sanctity
from
your
pride
so
that
where
you
will
there
the
church
may
be
and
may
not
be
where
you
will
not
must
it
then
be
in
a
small
portion
of
africa
in
the
corner
of
a
small
realm
among
you
but
not
among
us
in
another
part
of

and
not
in
spain
in
gaul
in
italy
where
you
are

if
you
will
have

among
you
not
in

pannonian

in

m≈ìsia

and
in

where
you
are

you
may
keep

then
of

of

is

as

thus
at

you
narrow

an
african
writer
contemporary
with
augustine
if
not
augustine
himself
enumerates
the
small
portions
of
the
donatist
sect
in
and
out
of
africa
and
asks
if
they
can
be
imagined
to
be
the
fulfilment
of
the
scripture
promise
to
the
church
if
the
holy
scriptures
have
assigned
the
church
to
africa
alone
or
to
the
scanty
cutzupitans
or
mountaineers
of
rome
or
to
the
house
or
patrimony
of
one
spanish
woman
however
the
argument
may
stand
from
other
writings
then
none
but
the
donatists
have
possession
of
the
church
if
holy
scripture
determines
it
to
the
few
moors
of
the
c√¶sarean
province
we
must
go
over
to
the
rogatists
if
to
the
few
tripolitans
or
byzacenes
and
provincials
the
maximianists
have
attained
to
it
if
in
the
orientals
only
it
is
to
be
sought
for
among
arians
eunomians
macedonians
and
others
that
may
be
there
for
who
can
enumerate
every
heresy
of
every
nation
but
if
christ
church
by
the
divine
and
most
certain
testimonies
of
canonical
scriptures
is
assigned
to
all
nations
whatever
may
be
adduced
and
from
whatever
quarter
cited
by
those
who
say
here
is
christ
and
lo
there
let
us
rather
hear
if
we
be
his
sheep
the
voice
of
our
shepherd
saying
unto
us
not
believe
for
they
are
not
each
found
in
the
many
nations
where
she
is
but
she
who
is
everywhere
is
found
where
they
are
lastly
let
us
hear
augustine
himself
again
in
the
same
controversy
they
do
not
communicate
with
us
as
you
say
he
observes
to
cresconius
novatians
arians
patripassians
valentinians
patricians
apellites
marcionites
ophites
and
the
rest
of
those
sacrilegious
names
as
you
call
them
of
nefarious
pests
rather
than
sects
yet
wheresoever
they
are
there
is
the
catholic
church
as
in
africa
it
is
where
you
are
on
the
other
hand
neither
you
nor
any
one
of
those
heresies
whatever
is
to
be
found
wherever
is
the
catholic
church
whence
it
appears
which
is
that
tree
whose
boughs
extend
over
all
the
earth
by
the
richness
of
its
fruitfulness
and
which
be
those
broken
branches
which
have
not
the
life
of
the
root
but
lie
and
wither
each
in
its
own
place
it
may
be
possibly
suggested
that
this
universality
which
the
fathers
ascribe
to
the
catholic
church
lay
in
its
apostolical
descent
or
again
in
its
episcopacy
and
that
it
was
one
not
as
being
one
kingdom
or
civitas
at
unity
with
itself
with
one
and
the
same
intelligence
in
every
part
one
sympathy
one
ruling
principle
one
organization
one
communion
but
because
though
consisting
of
a
number
of
independent
communities
at
variance
if
so
be
with
each
other
even
to
a
breach
of
communion
nevertheless
all
these
were
possessed
of
a
legitimate
succession
of
clergy
or
all
governed
by
bishops
priests
and
deacons
but
who
will
in
seriousness
maintain
that
relationship
or
that
sameness
of
structure
makes
two
bodies
one
england
and
prussia
are
both
of
them
monarchies
are
they
therefore
one
kingdom
england
and
the
united
states
are
from
one
stock
can
they
therefore
be
called
one
state
england
and
ireland
are
peopled
by
different
races
yet
are
they
not
one
kingdom
still
if
unity
lies
in
the
apostolical
succession
an
act
of
schism
is
from
the
nature
of
the
case
impossible
for
as
no
one
can
reverse
his
parentage
so
no
church
can
undo
the
fact
that
its
clergy
have
come
by
lineal
descent
from
the
apostles
either
there
is
no
such
sin
as
schism
or
unity
does
not
lie
in
the
episcopal
form
or
in
the
episcopal
ordination
and
this
is
felt
by
the
controversialists
of
this
day
who
in
consequence
are
obliged
to
invent
a
sin
and
to
consider
not
division
of
church
from
church
but
the
interference
of
church
with
church
to
be
the
sin
of
schism
as
if
local
dioceses
and
bishops
with
restraint
were
more
than
ecclesiastical
arrangements
and
of
the
church
however
sacred
while
schism
is
a
sin
against
her
essence
thus
they
strain
out
a
gnat
and
swallow
a
camel
division
is
the
schism
if
schism
there
be
not
interference
if
interference
is
a
sin
division
which
is
the
cause
of
it
is
a
greater
but
where
division
is
a
duty
there
can
be
no
sin
in
interference
far
different
from
such
a
theory
is
the
picture
which
the
ancient
church
presents
to
us
true
it
was
governed
by
bishops
and
those
bishops
came
from
the
apostles
but
it
was
a
kingdom
besides
and
as
a
kingdom
admits
of
the
possibility
of
rebels
so
does
such
a
church
involve
sectaries
and
schismatics
but
not
independent
portions
it
was
a
vast
organized
association
with
the
roman
empire
or
rather
overflowing
it
its
bishops
were
not
mere
local
officers
but
possessed
a
power
extending
wherever
a
christian
was
to
be
found
no
christian
says
bingham
would
pretend
to
travel
without
taking
letters
of
credence
with
him
from
his
own
bishop
if
he
meant
to
communicate
with
the
christian
church
in
a
foreign
country
such
was
the
admirable
unity
of
the
church
catholic
in
those
days
and
the
blessed
harmony
and
consent
of
her
bishops
among
one
another

over
all
the
regions
of

over
the
east
and
south
and
northern
parts
of
the
world
also
this
is
evidence
of
a
unity
throughout
christendom
not
of

origin

of
apostolical
succession
but
of
government

was

in
like
manner
styles
timothy
bishop
of
the

the
great
athanasius
as
he
returned
from
his
exile
made
no
scruple
to
ordain
in
several
cities
as
he
went
along
though
they
were
not
in
his
own
diocese

the
famous
eusebius
of
samosata
did
the
like

times

moreover
this

church
was
not

one
it
was
exclusive
also
as
to
the
vehemence
with
which
christians
of
the
period
denounced
the
idolatries
and
sins
of
paganism
and
proclaimed
the
judgments
which
would
be
their
consequence
this
is
well
known
and
led
to
their
being
reputed
in
the
heathen
world
as
enemies
of
mankind
worthily
doth
god
exert
the
lash
of
his
stripes
and
scourges
says
cyprian
to
a
heathen
magistrate
and
since
they
avail
so
little
and
convert
not
men
to
god
by
all
this
dreadfulness
of
havoc
there
abides
beyond
the
prison
eternal
and
the
ceaseless
flame
and
the
everlasting
penalty
why
humble
yourself
and
bend
to
false
gods
why
bow
your
captive
body
before
helpless
images
and
moulded
earth
why
grovel
in
the
prostration
of
death
like
the
serpent
whom
ye
worship
why
rush
into
the
downfall
of
the
devil
his
fall
the
cause
of
yours
and
he
your
companion
believe
and
live
you
have
been
our
persecutors
in
time
in
eternity
be
companions
of
our
joy
these
rigid
sentiments
says
gibbon
which
had
been
unknown
to
the
ancient
world
appear
to
have
infused
a
spirit
of
bitterness
into
a
system
of
love
and
harmony
such
however
was
the
judgment
passed
by
the
first
christians
upon
all
who
did
not
join
their
own
society
and
such
still
more
was
the
judgment
of
their
successors
on
those
who
lived
and
died
in
the
sects
and
heresies
which
had
issued
from
it
that
very
father
whose
denunciation
of
the
heathen
has
just
been
quoted
had
already
declared
it
even
in
the
third
century
he
who
leaves
the
church
of
christ
he
says
attains
not
to
christ
rewards
he
is
an
alien
an
outcast
an
enemy
he
can
no
longer
have
god
for
a
father
who
has
not
the
church
for
a
mother
if
any
man
was
able
to
escape
who
remained
without
the
ark
of
noah
then
will
that
man
escape
who
is
out
of
doors
beyond
the
church
what
sacrifice
do
they
believe
they
celebrate
who
are
rivals
of
the
priests
if
such
men
were
even
killed
for
confession
of
the
christian
name
not
even
by
their
blood
is
this
stain
washed
out
inexplicable
and
heavy
is
the
sin
of
discord
and
is
purged
by
no
suffering
they
can
not
dwell
with
god
who
have
refused
to
be
of
one
mind
in
god
church
a
man
of
such
sort
may
indeed
be
killed
crowned
he
can
not
be
and
so
again
chrysostom
in
the
following
century
in
harmony
with
cyprian
sentiment
though
we
have
achieved
ten
thousand
glorious
acts
yet
shall
we
if
we
cut
to
pieces
the
fulness
of
the
church
suffer
punishment
no
less
sore
than
they
who
mangled
his
body
in
like
manner
st
augustine
seems
to
consider
that
a
conversion
from
idolatry
to
a
schismatical
communion
is
no
gain
those
whom
donatists
baptize
they
heal
of
the
wound
of
idolatry
or
infidelity
but
inflict
a
more
grievous
stroke
in
the
wound
of
schism
for
idolaters
among
god
people
the
sword
destroyed
but
schismatics
the
gaping
earth
devoured
elsewhere
he
speaks
of
the
sacrilege
of
schism
which
surpasses
all
wickednesses
optatus
too
marvels
at
the
donatist
parmenian
inconsistency
in
maintaining
the
true
doctrine
that
schismatics
are
cut
off
as
branches
from
the
vine
are
destined
for
punishments
and
reserved
as
dry
wood
for
let
us
hate
them
who
are
worthy
of
hatred
says
cyril
withdraw
we
from
those
whom
god
withdraws
from
let
us
also
say
unto
god
with
all
boldness
concerning
all
heretics
not
i
hate
them
o
lord
that
hate
thee
most
firmly
hold
and
doubt
in
no
wise
says
fulgentius
that
every
heretic
and
schismatic
soever
baptized
in
the
name
of
father
son
and
holy
ghost
unless
aggregated
to
the
catholic
church
how
great
soever
have
been
his
alms
though
for
christ
name
he
has
even
shed
his
blood
can
in
no
wise
be
saved
the
fathers
ground
this
doctrine
on
paul
words
that
though
we
have
knowledge
and
give
our
goods
to
the
poor
and
our
body
to
be
burned
we
are
nothing
without
love
one
more
remark
shall
be
made
that
the
catholic
teachers
far
from
recognizing
any
ecclesiastical
relation
as
existing
between
the
sectarian
bishops
and
priests
and
their
people
address
the
latter
immediately
as
if
those
bishops
did
not
exist
and
call
on
them
to
come
over
to
the
church
individually
without
respect
to
any
one
besides
and
that
because
it
is
a
matter
of
life
and
death
to
take
the
instance
of
the
donatists
it
was
nothing
to
the
purpose
that
their
churches
in
africa
were
nearly
as
numerous
as
those
of
the
catholics
or
that
they
had
a
case
to
produce
in
their
controversy
with
the
catholic
church
the
very
fact
that
they
were
separated
from
the
was
a
public
a
manifest
a
simple
a
sufficient
argument
against
them
the
question
is
not
about
your
gold
and
silver
says
augustine
to
glorius
and
others
not
your
lands
or
farms
nor
even
your
bodily
health
is
in
peril
but
we
address
your
souls
about
obtaining
eternal
life
and
fleeing
eternal
death
rouse
yourself
therefore
you
see
it
all
and
know
it
and
groan
over
it
yet
god
sees
that
there
is
nothing
to
detain
you
in
so
pestiferous
and
sacrilegious
a
separation
if
you
will
but
overcome
your
carnal
affection
for
the
obtaining
the
spiritual
kingdom
and
rid
yourselves
of
the
fear
of
wounding
friendships
which
will
avail
nothing
in
god
judgment
for
escaping
eternal
punishment
go
think
over
the
matter
consider
what

be
said
in

no
one
blots
out
from

the

of

no

blots
out
from

the

he
hath

she
hath
filled
the
whole

some
carnal

he
says
to
his

severinus
hold
you
where
you
are
what
avails
temporal

or

if
with
it
we
neglect
christ
eternal
heritage
and
our
perpetual
health
i
ask
he
says
to
celer
a
person
of
influence
that
you
would
more
earnestly
urge
upon
your
men
catholic
unity
in
the
region
of
hippo
why
he
says
in
the
person
of
the
church
to
the
whole
donatist
population
why
open
your
ears
to
the
words
of
men
who
say
what
they
never
have
been
able
to
prove
and
close
them
to
the
word
of
god
saying
of
me
and
i
will
give
thee
the
heathen
for
thine
inheritance
at
another

he
says
to
them
some
of
the
presbyters
of
your
party
have
sent
to
us
to
say
from
our
flocks
unless
you
would
have
us
kill
you
how
much
more
justly
do
we
say
to
them
do
you
not
retire
from
but
come
in
peace
not
to
our
flocks
but
to
the
flocks
of
him
whose
we
are
all
or
if
you
will
not
and
are
far
from
peace
then
do
you
rather
retire
from
flocks
for
which
christ
shed
his
blood
i
call
on
you
for
christ
sake
he
says
to
a
late
to
write
me
an
answer
and
to
urge
gently
and
kindly
all
your
people
in
the
district
of
sinis
or
hippo
into
the
communion
of
the
catholic
church
he
publishes
an
address
to
the
donatists
at
another
time
to
inform
them
of
the
defeat
of
their
bishops
in
a
conference
whoso
he
says
is
separated
from
the
catholic
church
however
laudably
he
thinks
he
is
living
by
this
crime
alone
that
he
is
separated
from
christ
unity
he
shall
not
have
life
but
the
wrath
of
god
abideth
on
him
let
them
believe
of
the
catholic
church
he
writes
to
some
converts
about
their
friends
who
were
still
in
schism
that
is
to
the
church
diffused
over
the
whole
world
rather
what
the
scriptures
say
of
it
than
what
human
tongues
utter
in
calumny
the
idea
of
acting
upon
the
donatists
only
as
a
body
and
through
their
bishops
does
not
appear
to
have
occurred
to
augustine
at
all
on
the
whole
then
we
have
reason
to
say
that
if
there
be
a
form
of
christianity
at
this
day
distinguished
for
its
careful
organization
and
its
consequent
power
if
it
is
spread
over
the
world
if
it
is
conspicuous
for
zealous
maintenance
of
its
own
creed
if
it
is
intolerant
towards
what
it
considers
error
if
it
is
engaged
in
ceaseless
war
with
all
other
bodies
called
christian
if
it
and
it
alone
is
called
catholic
by
the
world
nay
by
those
very
bodies
and
if
it
makes
much
of
the
title
if
it
names
them
heretics
and
warns
them
of
coming
woe
and
calls
on
them
one
by
one
to
come
over
to
itself
overlooking
every
other
tie
and
if
they
on
the
other
hand
call
it
seducer
harlot
apostate
antichrist
devil
if
however
much
they
differ
one
with
another
they
consider
it
their
common
enemy
if
they
strive
to
unite
together
against
it
and
can
not
if
they
are
but
local
if
they
continually
subdivide
and
it
remains
one
if
they
fall
one
after
another
and
make
way
for
new
sects
and
it
remains
the
same
such
a
religious
communion
is
not
unlike
historical
christianity
as
it
comes
before
us
at
the
nicene
era
section
iii
the
church
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
centuries
the
patronage
extended
by
the
first
christian
emperors
to
arianism
its
adoption
by
the
barbarians
who
succeeded
to
their
power
the
subsequent
expulsion
of
all
heresy
beyond
the
limits
of
the
empire
and
then
again
the
monophysite
tendencies
of
egypt
and
part
of
syria
changed
in
some
measure
the
aspect
of
the
church
and
claim
our
further
attention
it
was
still
a
body
in
possession
or
approximating
to
the
possession
of
the
but
it
was
not
simply
intermixed
with
sectaries
as
we
have
been
surveying
it
in
the
earlier
periods
rather
it
lay
between
or
over
against
large
schisms
that
same
vast
association
which
and
which
only
had
existed
from
the
first
which
had
been
identified
by
all
parties
with
christianity
which
had
been
ever
called
catholic
by
people
and
by
laws
took
a
different
shape
collected
itself
in
far
greater
strength
on
some
points
of
her
extended
territory
than
on
others
possessed
whole
kingdoms
with
scarcely
a
rival
lost
others
partially
or
wholly
temporarily
or
for
good
was
stemmed
in
its
course
here
or
there
by
external
obstacles
and
was
defied
by
heresy
in
a
substantive
shape
and
in
mass
from
foreign
lands
and
with
the
support
of
the
temporal
power
thus
not
to
mention
the
arianism
of
the
eastern
empire
in
the
fourth
century
the
whole
of
the
west
was
possessed
by
the
same
heresy
in
the
fifth
and
nearly
the
whole
of
asia
east
of
the
euphrates
as
far
as
it
was
christian
by
the
nestorians
in
the
centuries
which
followed
while
the
monophysites
had
almost
the
possession
of
egypt
and
at
times
of
the
whole
eastern
church
i
think
it
no
assumption
to
call
arianism
nestorianism
and
eutychianism
heresies
or
to
identify
the
contemporary
catholic
church
with
christianity
now
then
let
us
consider
the
mutual
relation
of
christianity
and
heresy
under
these
circumstances
arians
of
the
gothic
no
heresy
has
started
with
greater
violence
or
more
sudden
success
than
the
arian
and
it
presents
a
still
more
remarkable
exhibition
of
these
characteristics
among
the
barbarians
than
in
the
civilized
world
even
among
the
greeks
it
had
shown
a
missionary
spirit
theophilus
in
the
reign
of
constantius
had
introduced
the
dominant
heresy
not
without
some
promising
results
to
the
sabeans
of
the
arabian
peninsula
but
under
valens
ulphilas
became
the
apostle
of
a
whole
race
he
taught
the
arian
doctrine
which
he
had
unhappily
learned
in
the
imperial
court
first
to
the
pastoral
m≈ìsogoths
who
unlike
the
other
branches
of
their
family
had
multiplied
under
the
m≈ìsian
mountains
with
neither
military
nor
religious
triumphs
the
visigoths
were
next
corrupted
by
whom
does
not
appear
it
is
one
of
the
singular
traits
in
the
history
of
this
vast
family
of
heathens
that
they
so
instinctively
caught
and
so
impetuously
communicated
and
so
fiercely
maintained
a
heresy
which
had
excited
in
the
empire
except
at
constantinople
little
interest
in
the
body
of
the
people
the
visigoths
are
said
to
have
been
converted
by
the
influence
of
valens
but
valens
reigned
for
only
fourteen
years
and
the
barbarian
population
which
had
been
admitted
to
the
empire
amounted
to
nearly
a
million
of
persons
it
is
as
difficult
to
trace
how
the
heresy
was
conveyed
from
them
to
the
other
barbarian
tribes
gibbon
seems
to
suppose
that
the
visigoths
acted
the
part
of
missionaries
in
their
career
of
predatory
warfare
from
thrace
to
the
pyrenees
but
such
is
the
fact
however
it
was
brought
about
that
the
success
in
arms
and
the
conversion
to
arianism
of
ostrogoths
alani
suevi
vandals
and
burgundians
stand
as
concurrent
events
in
the
history
of
the
times
and
by
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
the
heresy
had
been
established
by
the
visigoths
in
france
and
spain
in
portugal
by
the
suevi
in
africa
by
the
vandals
and
by
the
ostrogoths
in
italy
for
a
while
the
title
of
catholic
as
applied
to
the
church
seemed
a
misnomer
for
not
only
was
she
buried
beneath
these
populations
of
heresy
but
that
heresy
was
one
and
maintained
the
same
distinctive
tenet
whether
at
carthage
seville
toulouse
or
ravenna
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
these
northern
warriors
had
attained
to
any
high
degree
of
mental
cultivation
but
they
understood
their
own
religion
enough
to
hate
the
catholics
and
their
bishops
were
learned
enough
to
hold
disputations
for
its
propagation
they
professed
to
stand
upon
the
faith
of
ariminum
administering
baptism
under
an
altered
form
of
words
and
catholics
whom
they
gained
over
to
their
sect
it
must
be
added
that
whatever
was
their
cruelty
or
tyranny
both
goths
and
vandals
were
a
moral
people
and
put
to
shame
the
catholics
whom
they
dispossessed
what
can
the
prerogative
of
a
religious
name
profit
us
says
salvian
that
we
call
ourselves
catholic
boast
of
being
the
faithful
taunt
goths
and
vandals
with
the
reproach
of
an
heretical
appellation
while
we
live
in
heretical
wickedness
the
barbarians
were
chaste
temperate
just
and
devout
the
visigoth
theodoric
repaired
every
morning
with
his
domestic
officers
to
his
chapel
where
service
was
performed
by
the
arian
priests
and
one
singular
instance
is
on
record
of
the
defeat
of
a
visigoth
force
by
the
imperial
troops
on
a
sunday
when
instead
of
preparing
for
battle
they
were
engaged
in
the
religious
services
of
the
day
many
of
their
princes
were
men
of
great
ability
as
the
two
theodorics
euric
and
leovigild
successful
warriors
animated
by
a
fanatical
spirit
of
religion
were
not
likely
to
be
content
with
a
mere
profession
of
their
own
creed
they
proceeded
to
place
their
own
priests
in
the
religious
establishments
which
they
found
and
to
direct
a
bitter
persecution
against
the
vanquished
catholics
the
savage
cruelties
of
the
vandal
hunneric
in
africa
have
often
been
enlarged
upon
spain
was
the
scene
of
repeated
persecutions
sicily
too
had
its
martyrs
compared
with
these
enormities
it
was
but
a
little
thing
to
rob
the
catholics
of
their
churches
and
the
shrines
of
their
treasures
lands
immunities
and
jurisdictions
which
had
been
given
by
the
emperors
to
the
african
church
were
made
over
to
the
clergy
of
its
conquerors
and
by
the
time
of
belisarius
the
catholic
bishops
had
been
reduced
to
less
than
a
third
of
their
original
number
in
spain
as
in
africa
bishops
were
driven
from
their
sees
churches
were
destroyed
cemeteries
profaned
martyries
rifled
when
it
was
possible
the
catholics
concealed
the
relics
in
caves
keeping
up
a
perpetual
memory
of
these
provisional
repeated
spoliations
were
exercised
upon
the
property
of
the
church
leovigild
applied
its
treasures
partly
to
increasing
the
splendour
of
his
throne
partly
to
national
works
at
other
times
the
arian
clergy
themselves
must
have
been
the
recipients
of
the
plunder
for
when
childebert
the
frank
had
been
brought
into
spain
by
the
cruelties
exercised
against
the
catholic
queen
of
the
goths
who
was
his
sister
he
carried
away
with
him
from
the
arian
churches
as
gregory
of
tours
informs
us
sixty
chalices
fifteen
patens
twenty
cases
in
which
the
gospels
were
kept
all
of
pure
gold
and
ornamented
with
jewels
in
france
and
especially
in
italy
the
rule
of
the
heretical
power
was
much
less
oppressive
theodoric
the
ostrogoth
reigned
from
the
alps
to
sicily
and
till
the
close
of
a
long
reign
he
gave
an
ample
toleration
to
his
catholic
subjects
he
respected
their
property
suffered
their
churches
and
sacred
places
to
remain
in
their
hands
and
had
about
his
court
some
of
their
eminent
bishops
since
known
as
saints
c√¶sarius
of
arles
and
epiphanius
of
pavia
still
he
brought
into
the
country
a
new
population
devoted
to
arianism
or
as
we
now
speak
a
new
church
his
march
says
gibbon
must
be
considered
as
the
emigration
of
an
entire
people
the
wives
and
children
of
the
goths
their
aged
parents
and
most
precious
effects
were
carefully
transported
and
some
idea
may
be
formed
of
the
heavy
luggage
that
now
followed
the
camp
by
the
loss
of
two
thousand
waggons
which
had
been
sustained
in
a
single
action
in
the
war
of
epirus
to
his
soldiers
he
assigned
a
third
of
the
soil
of
italy
and
the
barbarian
families
settled
down
with
their
slaves
and
cattle
the
original
number
of
the
vandal
conquerors
of
africa
had
only
been
fifty
thousand
men
but
the
military
colonists
of
italy
soon
amounted
to
the
number
of
two
hundred
thousand
which
according
to
the
calculation
adopted
by
the
same
author
elsewhere
involves
a
population
of
a
million
the
least
that
could
be
expected
was
that
an
arian
ascendency
established
through
the
extent
of
italy
would
provide
for
the
sufficient
celebration
of
the
arian
worship
and
we
hear
of
the
arians
having
a
church
even
in
rome
the
rule
of
the
lombards
in
the
north
of
italy
succeeded
to
that
of
the
goths
arians
like
their
predecessors
without
their
toleration
the
clergy
whom
they
brought
with
them
seem
to
have
claimed
their
share
in
the
possession
of
the
catholic
churches
and
though
the
court
was
converted
at
the
end
of
thirty
years
many
cities
in
italy
were
for
some
time
afterwards
troubled
by
the
presence
of
heretical
bishops
the
rule
of
arianism
in
france
lasted
for
eighty
years
in
spain
for
a
hundred
and
eighty
in
africa
for
a
hundred
for
about
a
hundred
in
italy
these
periods
were
not
contemporaneous
but
extend
altogether
from
the
beginning
of
the
fifth
to
the
end
of
the
sixth
century
it
will
be
anticipated
that
the
duration
of
this
ascendency
of
error
had
not
the
faintest
tendency
to
deprive
the
ancient
church
of
the
west
of
the
title
of
catholic
and
it
is
needless
to
produce
evidence
of
a
fact
which
is
on
the
very
face
of
the
history
the
arians
seem
never
to
have
claimed
the
catholic
name
it
is
more
remarkable
that
the
catholics
during
this
period
were
denoted
by
the
additional
title
of
romans
of
this
there
are
many
proofs
in
the
histories
of
gregory
of
tours
victor
of
vite
and
the
spanish
councils
thus
gregory
speaks
of
theodegisilus
a
king
of
portugal
expressing
his
incredulity
at
a
miracle
by
saying
it
is
the
temper
of
the
romans
for
interposes
the
author
they
call
men
of
our
religion
romans
and
not
the
power
of
god
heresy
is
everywhere
an
enemy
to
catholics
says
the
same
gregory
in
a
subsequent
place
and
he
proceeds
to
illustrate
it
by
the
story
of
a
catholic
woman
who
had
a
heretic
husband
to
whom
he
says
came
a
presbyter
of
our
religion
very
catholic
and
whom
the
husband
matched
at
table
with
his
own
arian
presbyter
that
there
might
be
the
priests
of
each
religion
in
their
house
at
once
when
they
were
eating
the
husband
said
to
the
arian
let
us
have
some
sport
with
this
presbyter
of
the
romans
the
arian
count
gomachar
seized
on
the
lands
of
the
church
of
agde
in
france
and
was
attacked
with
a
fever
on
his
recovery
at
the
prayers
of
the
bishop
he
repented
of
having
asked
for
them
observing
what
will
these
romans
say
now
that
my
fever
came
of
taking
their
land
when
the
vandal
theodoric
would
have
killed
the
catholic
armogastes
after
failing
to
torture
him
into
heresy
his
presbyter
dissuaded
him
lest
the
romans
should
begin
to
call
him
a
martyr
this
appellation
had
two
meanings
one
which
will
readily
suggest
itself
is
its
use
in
contrast
to
the
word
barbarian
as
denoting
the
faith
of
the
empire
as
greek
occurs
in
paul
epistles
in
this
sense
it
would
more
naturally
be
used
by
the
romans
themselves
than
by
others
thus
salvian
says
that
nearly
all
the
romans
are
greater
sinners
than
the
barbarians
and
he
speaks
of
roman
heretics
of
which
there
is
an
innumerable
multitude
meaning
heretics
within
the
empire
and
so
gregory
the
great
complains
that
he
had
become
bishop
of
the
lombards
rather
than
of
the
romans
and
evagrius
speaking
even
of
the
east
contrasts
romans
and
barbarians
in
his
account
of
simeon
and
at
a
later
date
and
even
to
this
day
thrace
and
portions
of
dacia
and
of
asia
minor
derive
their
name
from
rome
in
like
manner
we
find
syrian
writers
sometimes
speaking
of
the
religion
of
the
romans
sometimes
of
the
greeks
as
synonymes
but
the
word
certainly
contains
also
an
allusion
to
the
faith
and
communion
of
the
roman
see
in
this
sense
the
emperor
theodosius
in
his
letter
to
acacius
of
ber≈ìa
contrasts
it
with
nestorianism
which
was
within
the
empire
as
well
as
catholicism
during
the
controversy
raised
by
that
heresy
he
exhorts
him
and
others
to
show
themselves
approved
priests
of
the
roman
religion
again
when
the
ligurian
nobles
were
persuading
the
arian
ricimer
to
come
to
terms
with
anthemius
the
orthodox
representative
of
the
greek
emperor
they
propose
to
him
to
send
epiphanius
as
ambassador
a
man
whose
life
is
venerable
to
every
catholic
and
roman
and
at
least
amiable
in
the
eyes
of
a
greek
if
he
deserves
the
sight
of
him
it
must
be
recollected
too
that
the
spanish
and
african
churches
actually
were
in
the
closest
union
with
the
see
of
rome
at
that
time
and
that
that
intercommunion
was
the
visible
ecclesiastical
distinction
between
them
and
their
arian
rivals
the
chief
ground
of
the
vandal
persecution
of
the
african
catholics
seems
to
have
been
their
connexion
with
their
brethren
beyond
the
sea
which
he
looked
at
with
jealousy
as
introducing
a
foreign
power
into
his
territory
prior
to
this
he
had
published
an
edict
calling
on
the
homo√ºsian
bishops
for
on
this
occasion
he
did
not
call
them
catholic
to
meet
his
own
bishops
at
carthage
and
treat
concerning
the
faith
that
their
meetings
to
the
seduction
of
christian
souls
might
not
be
held
in
the
provinces
of
the
vandals
upon
this
invitation
eugenius
of
carthage
replied
that
all
the
transmarine
bishops
of
the
orthodox
communion
ought
to
be
summoned
in
particular
because
it
is
a
matter
for
the
whole
world
not
special
to
the
african
provinces
that
they
could
not
undertake
a
point
of
faith
universitatis
hunneric
answered
that
if
eugenius
would
make
him
sovereign
of
the
he
would
comply
with
his
request
this
led
eugenius
to
say
that
the
orthodox
faith
was
the
only
true
faith
that
the
king
ought
to
write
to
his
allies
abroad
if
he
wished
to
know
it
and
that
he
himself
would
write
to
his
brethren
for
foreign
bishops
who
he
says
may
assist
us
in
setting
before
you
the
true
faith
common
to
them
and
to
us
and
especially
the
roman
church
which
is
the
head
of
all
churches
moreover
the
african
bishops
in
their
banishment
in
sardinia
to
the
number
of
sixty
with
fulgentius
at
their
head
quote
with
approbation
the
words
of
pope
hormisdas
to
the
effect
that
they
hold
on
the
point
of
free
will
and
divine
grace
what
the
roman
that
is
the
catholic
church
follows
and
preserves
again
the
spanish
church
was
under
the
superintendence
of
the
pope
vicar
during
the
persecutions
whose
duty
it
was
to
hinder
all
encroachments
upon
the
apostolical
decrees
or
the
limits
of
the
holy
fathers
through
the
whole
of
the
country
nor
was
the
association
of
catholicism
with
the
see
of
rome
an
introduction
of
that
age
the
emperor
gratian
in
the
fourth
century
had
ordered
that
the
churches
which
the
arians
had
usurped
should
be
restored
not
to
those
who
held
the
catholic
faith
or
the
nicene
creed
or
were
in
communion
with
the
but
who
chose
the
communion
of
damasus
the
then
pope
it
was
jerome
rule
also
in
some
passages
writing
against
ruffinus
who
had
spoken
of
our
faith
he
says
what
does
he
mean
by
faith
that
which
is
the
strength
of
the
roman
church
or
that
which
is
contained
in
the
volumes
of
origen
if
he
answer
roman
then
we
are
catholics
who
have
borrowed
nothing
of
origen
error
but
if
origen
blasphemy
be
his
faith
then
while
he
is
charging
me
with
inconsistency
he
proves
himself
to
be
an
heretic
the
other
passage
already
quoted
is
still
more
exactly
to
the
point
because
it
was
written
on
occasion
of
a
schism
the
divisions
at
antioch
had
thrown
the
catholic
church
into
a
remarkable
position
there
were
two
bishops
in
the
see
one
in
connexion
with
the
east
the
other
with
egypt
and
the
west
with
which
then
was
catholic
communion
jerome
has
no
doubt
on
the
subject
writing
to
damasus
he
says
since
the
east
tears
into
pieces
the
lord
coat
therefore
by
me
is
the
chair
of
peter
to
be
consulted
and
that
faith
which
is
praised
by
the
mouth
though
your
greatness
terrifies
me
yet
your
kindness
invites
me
from
the
priest
i
ask
the
salvation
of
the
victim
from
the
shepherd
the
protection
of
the
sheep
let
us
speak
without
offence
i
court
not
the
roman
height
i
speak
with
the
successor
of
the
fisherman
and
the
disciple
of
the
cross
i
who
follow
none
as
my
chief
but
christ
am
associated
in
communion
with
thy
blessedness
that
is
with
the
see
of
peter
on
that
rock
the
church
is
built
i
know
whoso
shall
eat
the
lamb
outside
that
house
is
profane
i
know
not
vitalis
the
apollinarian
meletius
i
reject
i
am
ignorant
of
paulinus
whoso
gathereth
not
with
thee
scattereth
that
is
he
who
is
not
of
christ
is
of
antichrist
again
the
ancient
authority
of
the
monks
dwelling
round
about
rises
against
me
i
meanwhile
cry
out
if
any
be
joined
to
peter
chair
he
is
mine
here
was
what
may
be
considered
a
vindice
the
church
being
divided
and
an
arbiter
wanted
such
a
case
had
also
occurred
in
africa
in
the
controversy
with
the
donatists
four
hundred
bishops
though
but
in
one
region
were
a
fifth
part
of
the
whole
episcopate
of
christendom
and
might
seem
too
many
for
a
schism
and
in
themselves
too
large
a
body
to
be
cut
off
from
god
inheritance
by
a
mere
majority
even
had
it
been
overwhelming
augustine
then
who
so
often
appeals
to
the
sometimes
adopts
a
more
prompt
criterion
he
tells
certain
donatists
to
whom
he
writes
that
the
catholic
bishop
of
carthage
was
able
to
make
light
of
the
thronging
multitude
of
his
enemies
when
he
found
himself
by
letters
of
credence
joined
both
to
the
roman
church
in
which
ever
had
flourished
the
principality
of
the
apostolical
see
and
to
the
other
lands
whence
the
gospel
came
to
africa
itself
there
are
good
reasons
then
for
explaining
the
gothic
and
arian
use
of
the
word
roman
when
applied
to
the
catholic
church
and
faith
of
something
beyond
its
mere
connexion
with
the
empire
which
the
barbarians
were
assaulting
nor
would
roman
surely
be
the
most
obvious
word
to
denote
the
orthodox
faith
in
the
mouths
of
a
people
who
had
learned
their
heresy
from
a
roman
emperor
and
court
and
who
professed
to
direct
their
belief
by
the
great
latin
council
of
ariminum
as
then
the
fourth
century
presented
to
us
in
its
external
aspect
the
catholic
church
lying
in
the
midst
of
a
multitude
of
sects
all
enemies
to
it
so
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
we
see
the
same
church
lying
in
the
west
under
the
oppression
of
a
huge
farspreading
and
schismatical
communion
heresy
is
no
longer
a
domestic
enemy
intermingled
with
the
church
but
it
occupies
its
own
ground
and
is
extended
over
against
her
even
though
on
the
same
territory
and
is
more
or
less
organized
and
can
not
be
so
promptly
refuted
by
the
simple
test
of
catholicity
the
churches
of
syria
and
asia
minor
were
the
most
intellectual
portion
of
early
christendom
alexandria
was
but
one
metropolis
in
a
large
region
and
contained
the
philosophy
of
the
whole
patriarchate
but
syria
abounded
in
wealthy
and
luxurious
cities
the
creation
of
the
seleucid√¶
where
the
arts
and
the
schools
of
greece
had
full
opportunities
of
cultivation
for
a
time
too
for
the
first
two
hundred
years
as
some
think
alexandria
was
the
only
see
as
well
as
the
only
school
of
egypt
while
syria
was
divided
into
smaller
dioceses
each
of
which
had
at
first
an
authority
of
its
own
and
which
even
after
the
growth
of
the
patriarchal
power
received
their
respective
bishops
not
from
the
see
of
antioch
but
from
their
own
metropolitan
in
syria
too
the
schools
were
private
a
circumstance
which
would
tend
both
to
diversity
in
religious
opinion
and
incaution
in
the
expression
of
it
but
the
sole
catechetical
school
of
egypt
was
the
organ
of
the
church
and
its
bishop
could
banish
origen
for
speculations
which
developed
and
ripened
with
impunity
in
syria
but
the
immediate
source
of
that
fertility
in
heresy
which
is
the
unhappiness
of
the
ancient
syrian
church
was
its
celebrated
exegetical
school
the
history
of
that
school
is
summed
up
in
the
broad
characteristic
fact
on
the
one
hand
that
it
devoted
itself
to
the
literal
and
critical
interpretation
of
scripture
and
on
the
other
that
it
gave
rise
first
to
the
arian
and
then
to
the
nestorian
heresy
if
additional
evidence
be
wanted
of
the
connexion
of
heterodoxy
and
biblical
criticism
in
that
age
it
is
found
in
the
fact
that
not
long
after
this
coincidence
in
syria
they
are
found
combined
in
the
person
of
theodore
of
heraclea
so
called
from
the
place
both
of
his
birth
and
his
bishoprick
an
able
commentator
and
an
active
enemy
of
athanasius
though
a
thracian
unconnected
except
by
sympathy
with
the
patriarchate
of
antioch
the
antiochene
school
appears
to
have
risen
in
the
middle
of
the
third
century
but
there
is
no
evidence
to
determine
whether
it
was
a
local
institution
or
as
is
more
probable
a
discipline
or
method
characteristic
generally
of
syrian
teaching
dorotheus
is
one
of
its
earliest
luminaries
he
is
known
as
a
hebrew
scholar
as
well
as
a
commentator
on
the
sacred
text
and
he
was
the
master
of
eusebius
of
c√¶sarea
lucian
the
friend
of
the
notorious
paul
of
samosata
and
for
three
successive
episcopates
after
him
separated
from
the
church
though
afterwards
a
martyr
in
it
was
the
author
of
a
new
edition
of
the
septuagint
and
master
of
the
chief
original
teachers
of
arianism
eusebius
of
c√¶sarea
asterius
called
the
sophist
and
eusebius
of
emesa
arians
of
the
nicene
period
and
diodorus
a
zealous
opponent
of
arianism
but
the
master
of
theodore
of
mopsuestia
have
all
a
place
in
the
exegetical
school
chrysostom
and
theodoret
both
syrians
and
the
former
the
pupil
of
diodorus
adopted
the
literal
interpretation
though
preserved
from
its
abuse
but
the
principal
doctor
of
the
school
was
that
theodore
the
master
of
nestorius
who
has
just
above
been
mentioned
and
who
with
his
writings
and
with
the
writings
of
theodoret
against
cyril
and
the
letter
written
by
ibas
of
edessa
to
maris
was
condemned
by
the
fifth
ecumenical
council
ibas
was
the
translator
into
syriac
and
maris
into
persian
of
the
books
of
theodore
and
diodorus
and
thus
they
became
immediate
instruments
in
the
formation
of
the
great
nestorian
school
and
church
in
farther
asia
as
many
as
ten
thousand
tracts
of
theodore
are
said
in
this
way
to
have
been
introduced
to
the
knowledge
of
the
christians
of
mesopotamia
adiabene
babylonia
and
the
neighbouring
countries
he
was
called
by
those
churches
absolutely
the
interpreter
and
it
eventually
became
the
very
profession
of
the
nestorian
communion
to
follow
him
as
such
the
doctrine
of
all
our
eastern
churches
says
their
council
under
the
patriarch
marabas
is
founded
on
the
creed
of
nic√¶a
but
in
the
exposition
of
the
scriptures
we
follow
st
theodore
we
must
by
all
means
remain
firm
to
the
commentaries
of
the
great
commentator
says
the
council
under
sabarjesus
whoso
shall
in
any
manner
oppose
them
or
think
otherwise
be
he
anathema
no
one
since
the
beginning
of
christianity
except
origen
and
augustine
has
had
so
great
literary
influence
on
his
brethren
as
theodore
the
original
syrian
school
had
possessed
very
marked
characteristics
which
it
did
not
lose
when
it
passed
into
a
new
country
and
into
strange
tongues
its
comments
on
scripture
seem
to
have
been
clear
natural
methodical
apposite
and
logically
exact
in
all
western
aram√¶a
says
lengerke
that
is
in
syria
there
was
but
one
mode
of
treating
whether
exegetics
or
doctrine
the
practical
thus
eusebius
of
c√¶sarea
whether
as
a
disputant
or
a
commentator
is
commonly
a
writer
of
sense
and
judgment
and
he
is
to
be
referred
to
the
syrian
school
though
he
does
not
enter
so
far
into
its
temper
as
to
exclude
the
mystical
interpretation
or
to
deny
the
verbal
inspiration
of
scripture
again
we
see
in
chrysostom
a
direct
straightforward
treatment
of
the
sacred
text
and
a
pointed
application
of
it
to
things
and
persons
and
theodoret
abounds
in
modes
of
thinking
and
reasoning
which
without
any
great
impropriety
may
be
called
english
again
cyril
of
jerusalem
though
he
does
not
abstain
from
allegory
shows
the
character
of
his
school
by
the
great
stress
he
lays
upon
the
study
of
scripture
and
i
may
add
by
the
peculiar
characteristics
of
his
style
which
will
be
appreciated
by
a
modern
reader
it
would
have
been
well
had
the
genius
of
the
syrian
theology
been
ever
in
the
safe
keeping
of
men
such
as
cyril
chrysostom
and
theodoret
but
in
theodore
of
mopsuestia
nay
in
diodorus
before
him
it
developed
into
those
errors
of
which
paul
of
samosata
had
been
the
omen
on
its
rise
as
its
attention
was
chiefly
directed
to
the
examination
of
the
scriptures
in
its
interpretation
of
the
scriptures
was
its
heretical
temper
discovered
and
though
allegory
can
be
made
an
instrument
for
evading
scripture
doctrine
criticism
may
more
readily
be
turned
to
the
destruction
of
doctrine
and
scripture
together
theodore
was
bent
on
ascertaining
the
literal
sense
an
object
with
which
no
fault
could
be
found
but
leading
him
of
course
to
the
hebrew
text
instead
of
the
septuagint
it
also
led
him
to
jewish
commentators
jewish
commentators
naturally
suggested
events
and
objects
short
of
evangelical
as
the
fulfilment
of
the
prophetical
announcements
and
when
it
was
possible
an
ethical
sense
instead
of
a
prophetical
the
eighth
chapter
of
proverbs
ceased
to
bear
a
christian
meaning
because
as
theodore
maintained
the
writer
of
the
book
had
received
the
gift
not
of
prophecy
but
of
wisdom
the
canticles
must
be
interpreted
literally
and
then
it
was
but
an
easy
or
rather
a
necessary
step
to
exclude
the
book
from
the
canon
the
book
of
job
too
professed
to
be
historical
yet
what
was
it
really
but
a
gentile
drama
he
also
gave
up
the
books
of
chronicles
and
ezra
and
strange
to
say
the
epistle
of
james
though
it
was
contained
in
the
peschito
version
of
his
church
he
denied
that
psalms
and
and
applied
to
our
lord
rather
he
limited
the
messianic
passages
of
the
whole
book
to
four
of
which
the
eighth
psalm
was
one
and
the
another
the
rest
he
explained
of
hezekiah
and
zerubbabel
without
denying
that
they
might
be
accommodated
to
an
evangelical
sense
he
explained
thomas
words
my
lord
and
my
god
as
an
exclamation
of
joy
and
our
lord
receive
ye
the
holy
ghost
as
an
anticipation
of
the
day
of
pentecost
as
may
be
expected
he
denied
the
verbal
inspiration
of
scripture
also
he
held
that
the
deluge
did
not
cover
the
earth
and
as
others
before
him
he
was
heterodox
on
the
doctrine
of
original
sin
and
denied
the
eternity
of
punishment
maintaining
that
the
real
sense
of
scripture
was
not
the
scope
of
a
divine
intelligence
but
the
intention
of
the
mere
human
organ
of
inspiration
theodore
was
led
to
hold
not
only
that
that
sense
was
one
in
each
text
but
that
it
was
continuous
and
single
in
a
context
that
what
was
the
subject
of
the
composition
in
one
verse
must
be
the
subject
in
the
next
and
that
if
a
psalm
was
historical
or
prophetical
in
its
commencement
it
was
the
one
or
the
other
to
its
termination
even
that
fulness
of
meaning
refinement
of
thought
subtle
versatility
of
feeling
and
delicate
reserve
or
reverent
suggestiveness
which
poets
exemplify
seems
to
have
been
excluded
from
his
idea
of
a
sacred
composition
accordingly
if
a
psalm
contained
passages
which
could
not
be
applied
to
our
lord
it
followed
that
that
psalm
did
not
properly
apply
to
him
at
all
except
by
accommodation
such
at
least
is
the
doctrine
of
cosmas
a
writer
of
theodore
school
who
on
this
ground
passes
over
the
and
other
psalms
and
limits
the
messianic
to
the
second
the
eighth
the
and
the
hundred
and
tenth
david
he
says
did
not
make
common
to
the
servants
what
belongs
to
the
lord
christ
but
what
was
proper
to
the
lord
he
spoke
of
the
lord
and
what
was
proper
to
the
servants
of
servants
accordingly
the
could
not
properly
belong
to
christ
because
in
the
beginning
it
spoke
of
the
delictorum
a
remarkable
consequence
would
follow
from
this
doctrine
that
as
christ
was
to
be
separated
from
his
saints
so
the
saints
were
to
be
separated
from
christ
and
an
opening
was
made
for
a
denial
of
the
doctrine
of
their
though
this
denial
in
the
event
has
not
been
developed
among
the
nestorians
but
a
more
serious
consequence
is
latently
contained
in
it
and
nothing
else
than
the
nestorian
heresy
viz
that
our
lord
manhood
is
not
so
intimately
included
in
his
divine
personality
that
his
brethren
according
to
the
flesh
may
be
associated
with
the
image
of
the
one
christ
here
chrysostom
pointedly
contradicts
the
doctrine
of
theodore
though
his
and
friend
as
does
ephrem
though
a
syrian
also
and
st
basil
one
other
peculiarity
of
the
syrian
school
viewed
as
independent
of
nestorius
should
be
added
as
it
tended
to
the
separation
of
the
divine
person
of
christ
from
his
manhood
so
did
it
tend
to
explain
away
his
divine
presence
in
the
sacramental
elements
ernesti
seems
to
consider
the
school
in
modern
language
sacramentarian
and
certainly
some
of
the
most
cogent
testimonies
brought
by
moderns
against
the
catholic
doctrine
of
the
eucharist
are
taken
from
writers
who
are
connected
with
that
school
as
the
author
said
to
be
chrysostom
of
the
epistle
to
c√¶sarius
theodoret
in
his
eranistes
and
facundus
some
countenance
too
is
given
to
the
same
view
of
the
eucharist
at
least
in
some
parts
of
his
works
by
origen
whose
language
concerning
the
incarnation
also
leans
to
what
was
afterwards
nestorianism
to
these
may
be
added
eusebius
who
far
removed
as
he
was
from
that
heresy
was
a
disciple
of
the
syrian
school
the
language
of
the
later
nestorian
writers
seems
to
have
been
of
the
same
character
such
then
on
the
whole
is
the
character
of
that
theology
of
theodore
which
passed
from
cilicia
and
antioch
to
edessa
first
and
then
to
nisibis
edessa
the
metropolis
of
mesopotamia
had
remained
an
oriental
city
till
the
third
century
when
it
was
made
a
roman
colony
by
caracalla
its
position
on
the
confines
of
two
empires
gave
it
great
ecclesiastical
importance
as
the
channel
by
which
the
theology
of
rome
and
greece
was
conveyed
to
a
family
of
christians
dwelling
in
contempt
and
persecution
amid
a
still
heathen
world
it
was
the
seat
of
various
schools
apparently
of
a
greek
school
where
the
classics
were
studied
as
well
as
theology
where
eusebius
of
emesa
had
originally
been
trained
and
where
perhaps
protogenes
taught
there
were
also
syrian
schools
attended
by
heathen
and
christian
youths
in
common
the
cultivation
of
the
native
language
had
been
an
especial
object
of
its
masters
since
the
time
of
vespasian
so
that
the
pure
and
refined
dialect
went
by
the
name
of
the
edessene
at
edessa
too
ephrem
formed
his
own
syrian
school
which
lasted
long
after
him
and
there
too
was
the
celebrated
persian
christian
school
over
which
maris
presided
who
has
been
already
mentioned
as
the
translator
of
theodore
into
persian
even
in
the
time
of
the
predecessor
of
ibas
in
the
see
before
the
nestorianism
of
this
persian
school
was
so
notorious
that
rabbula
the
bishop
had
expelled
its
masters
and
scholars
and
they
taking
refuge
in
a
country
which
might
be
called
their
own
had
introduced
the
heresy
to
the
churches
subject
to
the
persian
king
something
ought
to
be
said
of
these
churches
though
little
is
known
except
what
is
revealed
by
the
fact
in
itself
of
no
slight
value
that
they
had
sustained
two
persecutions
at
the
hands
of
the
heathen
government
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
one
testimony
is
extant
as
early
as
the
end
of
the
second
century
to
the
effect
that
in
parthia
media
persia
and
bactria
there
were
christians
who
were
not
overcome
by
evil
laws
and
customs
in
the
early
part
of
the
fourth
century
a
bishop
of
persia
attended
the
nicene
council
and
about
the
same
time
christianity
is
said
to
have
pervaded
nearly
the
whole
of
assyria
monachism
had
been
introduced
there
before
the
middle
of
the
fourth
century
and
shortly
after
commenced
that
fearful
persecution
in
which
sixteen
thousand
christians
are
said
to
have
suffered
it
lasted
thirty
years
and
is
said
to
have
recommenced
at
the
end
of
the
century
the
second
persecution
lasted
for
at
least
another
thirty
years
of
the
next
at
the
very
time
when
the
nestorian
troubles
were
in
progress
in
the
empire
trials
such
as
these
show
the
populousness
as
well
as
the
faith
of
the
churches
in
those
parts
and
the
number
of
the
sees
for
the
names
of
bishops
are
preserved
who
suffered
in
the
former
persecution
one
of
them
was
apprehended
together
with
sixteen
priests
nine
deacons
besides
monks
and
nuns
of
his
diocese
another
with
companions
ecclesiastics
or
regulars
another
with
one
hundred
ecclesiastics
of
different
orders
another
with
one
hundred
and
another
with
his
chorepiscopus
and
two
hundred
and
fifty
of
his
clergy
such
was
the
church
consecrated
by
the
blood
of
so
many
martyrs
which
immediately
after
its
glorious
confession
fell
a
prey
to
the
theology
of
theodore
and
which
through
a
succession
of
ages
manifested
the
energy
when
it
had
lost
the
pure
orthodoxy
of
saints
the
members
of
the
persian
school
who
had
been
driven
out
of
edessa
by
rabbula
found
a
wide
field
open
for
their
exertions
under
the
pagan
government
with
which
they
had
taken
refuge
the
persian
monarchs
who
had
often
prohibited
by
edict
the
intercommunion
of
the
church
under
their
sway
with
the
countries
towards
the
west
readily
extended
their
protection
to
exiles
whose
very
profession
was
the
means
of
destroying
its
catholicity
barsumas
the
most
energetic
of
them
was
placed
in
the
metropolitan
see
of
nisibis
where
also
the
fugitive
school
was
settled
under
the
presidency
of
another
of
their
party
while
maris
was
promoted
to
the
see
of
ardaschir
the
primacy
of
the
church
had
from
an
early
period
belonged
to
the
see
of
seleucia
in
babylonia
catholicus
was
the
title
appropriated
to
its
occupant
as
well
as
to
the
persian
primate
as
being
deputies
of
the
patriarch
of
antioch
and
was
derived
apparently
from
the
imperial
dignity
so
called
denoting
their
function
as
or
officers
in
chief
for
the
regions
in
which
they
were
placed
acacius
another
of
the
edessene
party
was
put
into
this
principal
see
and
suffered
if
he
did
not
further
the
innovations
of
barsumas
the
mode
by
which
the
latter
effected
those
measures
has
been
left
on
record
by
an
enemy
barsumas
accused

it
is

that
in
this
way
he
obtained
the
death
of
babu√¶us

acacius
succeeded
when
a
minority
resisted
the
process

a
persecution
followed
the
death
of
seven
thousand
seven
hundred
catholics
is
said
by
monophysite
authorities
to
have
been
the
price
of
the
severance
of
the
chaldaic
churches
from
christendom
their
loss
was
compensated
in
the
eyes
of
the
government
by
the
multitude
of
nestorian
fugitives
who
flocked
into
persia
from
the
empire
numbers
of
them
industrious
artisans
who
sought
a
country
where
their
own
religion
was
in
the
ascendant
that
religion
was
founded
as
we
have
already
seen
in
the
literal
interpretation
of
holy
scripture
of
which
theodore
was
the
principal
teacher
the
doctrine
in
which
it
formally
consisted
is
known
by
the
name
of
nestorianism
it
lay
in
the
ascription
of
a
human
as
well
as
a
divine
personality
to
our
lord
and
it
showed
itself
in
denying
the
title
of
mother
of
god
or
Œ∏ŒµŒøœÑ·ΩπŒ∫ŒøœÇ
to
the
blessed
mary
as
to
our
lord
personality
the
question
of
language
came
into
the
controversy
which
always
serves
to
perplex
a
subject
and
make
a
dispute
seem
a
matter
of
words
the
native
syrians
made
a
distinction
between
the
word
person
and
prosopon
which
stands
for
it
in
greek
they
allowed
that
there
was
one
prosopon
or
parsopa
as
they
called
it
and
they
heldthat
there
were
two
persons
if
it
is
asked
what
they
meant
by
the
answer
seems
to
be
that
they
took
the
word
merely
in
the
sense
of
or
a
sense
familiar
to
the
greek
and
quite
irrelevant
as
a
guarantee
of
their
orthodoxy
it
follows
moreover
that
since
the
of
a
thing
is
its
impression
upon
the
beholder
the
personality
to
which
they
ascribed
unity
must
have
laid
in
our
lord
manhood
and
not
in
his
divine
nature
but
it
is
hardly
worth
while
pursuing
the
heresy
to
its
limits
next
as
to
the
phrase
mother
of
god
they
rejected
it
as
unscriptural
they
maintained
that
mary
was
mother
of
the
humanity
of
christ
not
of
the
word
and
they
fortified
themselves
by
the
nicene
creed
in
which
no
such
title
is
ascribed
to
her
whatever
might
be
the
obscurity
or
the
plausibility
of
their
original
dogma
there
is
nothing
obscure
or
attractive
in
the
developments
whether
of
doctrine
or
of
practice
in
which
it
issued
the
first
act
of
the
exiles
of
edessa
on
their
obtaining
power
in
the
chaldean
communion
was
to
abolish
the
celibacy
of
the
clergy
or
in
forcible
words
to
allow
the
public
and
reiterated
nuptials
of
the
priests
the
bishops
and
even
the
patriarch
himself
barsumas
the
great
instrument
of
the
change
of
religion
was
the
first
to
set
an
example
of
the
new
usage
and
is
even
said
by
a
nestorian
writer
to
have
married
a
nun
he
passed
a
canon
at
councils
held
at
seleucia
and
elsewhere
that
bishops
and
priests
might
marry
and
might
renew
their
wives
as
often
as
they
lost
them
the
catholicus
who
followed
acacius
went
so
far
as
to
extend
the
benefit
of
the
canon
to
monks
that
is
to
destroy
the
monastic
order
and
his
two
successors
availed
themselves
of
this
liberty
and
are
recorded
to
have
been
fathers
a
restriction
however
was
afterwards
placed
upon
the
catholicus
and
upon
the
episcopal
order
such
were
the
circumstances
and
such
the
principles
under
which
the
see
of
seleucia
became
the
rome
of
the
east
in
the
course
of
time
the
catholicus
took
on
himself
the
loftier
and
independent
title
of
patriarch
of
babylon
and
though
seleucia
was
changed
for
ctesiphon
and
for
bagdad
still
the
name
of
babylon
was
preserved
from
first
to
last
as
a
formal
or
ideal
metropolis
in
the
time
of
the
caliphs
it
was
at
the
head
of
as
many
as
archbishops
its
communion
extended
from
china
to
jerusalem
and
its
numbers
with
those
of
the
monophysites
are
said
to
have
surpassed
those
of
the
greek
and
latin
churches
together
the
nestorians
seem
to
have
been
unwilling
like
the
novatians
to
be
called
by
the
name
of
their
founder
though
they
confessed
it
had
adhered
to
them
one
instance
may
be
specified
of
their
assuming
the
name
of
catholic
but
there
is
nothing
to
show
it
was
given
them
by
others
from
the
conquest
of
persia
says
gibbon
they
carried
their
spiritual
arms
to
the
north
the
east
and
the
south
and
the
simplicity
of
the
gospel
was
fashioned
and
painted
with
the
colours
of
the
syriac
theology
in
the
sixth
century
according
to
the
report
of
a
nestorian
traveller
christianity
was
successfully
preached
to
the
bactrians
the
huns
the
persians
the
indians
the
persarmenians
the
medes
and
the
elamites
the
barbaric
churches
from
the
gulf
of
persia
to
the
caspian
sea
were
almost
infinite
and
their
recent
faith
was
conspicuous
in
the
number
and
sanctity
of
their
monks
and
martyrs
the
pepper
coast
of
malabar
and
the
isles
of
the
ocean
socotra
and
ceylon
were
peopled
with
an
increasing
multitude
of
christians
and
the
bishops
and
clergy
of
those
sequestered
regions
derived
their
ordination
from
the
catholicus
of
babylon
in
a
subsequent
age
the
zeal
of
the
nestorians
overleaped
the
limits
which
had
confined
the
ambition
and
curiosity
both
of
the
greeks
and
persians
the
missionaries
of
balch
and
samarcand
pursued
without
fear
the
footsteps
of
the
roving
tartar
and
insinuated
themselves
into
the
camps
of
the
valleys
of
imaus
and
the
banks
of
the
selinga
eutyches
was
archimandrite
or
abbot
of
a
monastery
in
the
suburbs
of
constantinople
he
was
a
man
of
unexceptionable
character
and
was
of
the
age
of
seventy
years
and
had
been
abbot
for
thirty
at
the
date
of
his
unhappy
introduction
into
ecclesiastical
history
he
had
been
the
friend
and
assistant
of
cyril
of
alexandria
and
had
lately
taken
part
against
ibas
bishop
of
edessa
whose
name
has
occurred
in
the
above
account
of
the
nestorians
for
some
time
he
had
been
engaged
in
teaching
a
doctrine
concerning
the
incarnation
which
he
maintained
indeed
to
be
none
other
than
that
of
cyril
in
his
controversy
with
nestorius
but
which
others
denounced
as
a
heresy
in
the
opposite
extreme
and
substantially
a
reassertion
of
apollinarianism
the
subject
was
brought
before
a
council
of
constantinople
under
the
presidency
of
flavian
the
patriarch
in
the
year
and
eutyches
was
condemned
by
the
assembled
bishops
of
holding
the
doctrine
of
one
instead
of
two
natures
in
christ
it
is
scarcely
necessary
for
our
present
purpose
to
ascertain
accurately
what
he
held
and
there
has
been
a
great
deal
of
controversy
on
the
subject
partly
from
confusion
between
him
and
his
successors
partly
from
the
indecision
or
the
ambiguity
which
commonly
attaches
to
the
professions
of
heretics
if
a
statement
must
here
be
made
of
the
doctrine
of
eutyches
himself
in
whom
the
controversy
began
let
it
be
said
to
consist
in
these
two
tenets
in
maintaining
first
that
before
the
incarnation
there
were
two
natures
after
their
union
one
or
that
our
lord
was
of
or
from
two
natures
but
not
in
two
and
secondly
that
his
flesh
was
not
of
one
substance
with
ours
that
is
not
of
the
substance
of
the
blessed
virgin
of
these
two
points
he
seemed
willing
to
abandon
the
second
but
was
firm
in
his
maintenance
of
the
first
but
let
us
return
to
the
council
of
constantinople
in
his
examination
eutyches
allowed
that
the
holy
virgin
was
consubstantial
with
us
and
that
our
god
was
incarnate
of
her
but
he
would
not
allow
that
he
was
therefore
as
man
consubstantial
with
us
his
notion
apparently
being
that
union
with
the
divinity
had
changed
what
otherwise
would
have
been
human
nature
however
when
pressed
he
said
that
though
up
to
that
day
he
had
not
permitted
himself
to
discuss
the
nature
of
christ
or
to
affirm
that
god
body
is
body
though
it
was
human
yet
he
would
allow
if
commanded
our
consubstantiality
with
us
upon
this
flavian
observed
that
the
council
was
introducing
no
innovation
but
declaring
the
faith
of
the
fathers
to
his
other
position
however
that
our
lord
had
but
one
nature
after
the
incarnation
he
adhered
when
the
catholic
doctrine
was
put
before
him
he
answered
let
athanasius
be
read
you
will
find
nothing
of
the
kind
in
him
his
condemnation
followed
it
was
signed
by
bishops
and
abbots
among
the
former
were
flavian
of
constantinople
basil
metropolitan
of
seleucia
in
isauria
the
metropolitans
of
amasea
in
pontus
and
marcianopolis
in
m≈ìsia
and
the
bishop
of
cos
the
pope
minister
at
constantinople
eutyches
appealed
to
the
pope
of
the
day
leo
who
at
first
hearing
took
his
part
he
wrote
to
flavian
that
judging
by
the
statement
of
eutyches
he
did
not
see
with
what
justice
he
had
been
separated
from
the
communion
of
the
church
send
therefore
he
continued
some
suitable
person
to
give
us
a
full
account
of
what
has
occurred
and
let
us
know
what
the
new
error
is
flavian
who
had
behaved
with
great
forbearance
throughout
the
proceedings
had
not
much
difficulty
in
setting
the
controversy
before
the
pope
in
its
true
light
eutyches
was
supported
by
the
imperial
court
and
by
dioscorus
the
patriarch
of
alexandria
the
proceedings
therefore
at
constantinople
were
not
allowed
to
settle
the
question
a
general
council
was
summoned
for
the
ensuing
summer
at
ephesus
where
the
third
ecumenical
council
had
been
held
twenty
years
before
against
nestorius
it
was
attended
by
sixty
metropolitans
ten
from
each
of
the
great
divisions
of
the
east
the
whole
number
of
bishops
assembled
amounted
to
one
hundred
and
dioscorus
was
appointed
president
by
the
emperor
and
the
object
of
the
assembly
was
said
to
be
the
settlement
of
a
question
of
faith
which
had
arisen
between
flavian
and
eutyches
leo
dissatisfied
with
the
measure
altogether
nevertheless
sent
his
legates
but
with
the
object
as
their
commission
stated
and
a
letter
he
addressed
to
the
council
of
condemning
the
heresy
and
reinstating
eutyches
if
he
retracted
his
legates
took
precedence
after
dioscorus
and
before
the
other
patriarchs
he
also
published
at
this
time
his
celebrated
tome
on
the
incarnation
in
a
letter
addressed
to
flavian
the
proceedings
which
followed
were
of
so
violent
a
character
that
the
council
has
gone
down
to
posterity
under
the
name
of
the
latrocinium
or
gang
of
robbers
eutyches
was
honourably
acquitted
and
his
doctrine
received
but
the
assembled
fathers
showed
some
backwardness
to
depose
flavian
dioscorus
had
been
attended
by
a
multitude
of
monks
furious
zealots
for
the
monophysite
doctrine
from
syria
and
egypt
and
by
an
armed
force
these
broke
into
the
church
at
his
call
flavian
was
thrown
down
and
trampled
on
and
received
injuries
of
which
he
died
the
third
day
after
the
pope
legates
escaped
as
they
could
and
the
bishops
were
compelled
to
sign
a
blank
paper
which
was
afterwards
filled
up
with
the
condemnation
of
flavian
these
outrages
however
were
subsequent
to
the
synodical
acceptance
of
the
creed
of
eutyches
which
seems
to
have
been
the
spontaneous
act
of
the
assembled
fathers
the
proceedings
ended
by
dioscorus
excommunicating
the
pope
and
the
emperor
issuing
an
edict
in
approval
of
the
decision
of
the
council
before
continuing
the
narrative
let
us
pause
awhile
to
consider
what
it
has
already
brought
before
us
an
aged
and
blameless
man
the
friend
of
a
saint
and
him
the
great
champion
of
the
faith
against
the
heresy
of
his
day
is
found
in
the
belief
and
maintenance
of
a
doctrine
which
he
declares
to
be
the
very
doctrine
which
that
saint
taught
in
opposition
to
that
heresy
to
prove
it
he
and
his
friends
refer
to
the
very
words
of
cyril
eustathius
of
berytus
quoting
from
him
at
ephesus
as
follows
we
must
not
then
conceive
two
natures
but
one
nature
of
the
word
incarnate
moreover
it
seems
that
cyril
had
been
called
to
account
for
this
very
phrase
and
had
appealed
more
than
once
to
a
passage
which
is
extant
as
he
quoted
it
in
a
work
by
st
athanasius
whether
the
passage
in
question
is
genuine
is
very
doubtful
but
that
is
not
to
the
purpose
for
the
phrase
which
it
contains
is
also
attributed
by
cyril
to
other
fathers
and
was
admitted
by
catholics
generally
as
by
flavian
who
deposed
eutyches
nay
was
indirectly
adopted
by
the
council
of
chalcedon
itself
but
eutyches
did
not
merely
insist
upon
a
phrase
he
appealed
for
his
doctrine
to
the
fathers
generally
i
have
read
the
blessed
cyril
and
the
holy
fathers
and
the
holy
athanasius
he
says
at
constantinople
that
they
said
two
natures
before
the
union
but
that
the
union
they
said
one
in
his
letter
to
leo
he
appeals
in
particular
to
pope
julius
pope
felix
gregory
thaumaturgus
gregory
nazianzen
st
basil
atticus
and
proclus
he
did
not
appeal
to
them
unreservedly
certainly
as
shall
be
presently
noticed
he
allowed
that
they
might
err
and
perhaps
had
erred
in
their
expressions
but
it
is
plain
even
from
what
has
been
said
that
there
could
be
no
against
him
as
the
word
is
now
commonly
understood
it
is
also
undeniable
that
though
the
word
nature
is
applied
to
our
lord
manhood
by
ambrose
gregory
nazianzen
and
others
yet
on
the
whole
it
is
for
whatever
reason
avoided
by
the
previous
fathers
certainly
by
athanasius
who
uses
the
words
manhood
flesh
the
man
economy
where
a
later
writer
would
have
used
nature
and
the
same
is
true
of
st
hilary
in
like
manner
the
athanasian
creed
written
as
it
is
supposed
some
twenty
years
before
the
date
of
eutyches
does
not
contain
the
word
nature
much
might
be
said
on
the
plausibility
of
the
defence
which
eutyches
might
have
made
for
his
doctrine
from
the
history
and
documents
of
the
church
before
his
time
further
eutyches
professed
to
subscribe
heartily
the
decrees
of
the
council
of
nic√¶a
and
ephesus
and
his
friends
appealed
to
the
latter
of
these
councils
and
to
previous
fathers
in
proof
that
nothing
could
be
added
to
the
creed
of
the
church
i
he
says
to
leo
even
from
my
elders
have
so
understood
and
from
my
childhood
have
so
been
instructed
as
the
holy
and
ecumenical
council
at
nic√¶a
of
the
three
hundred
and
eighteen
most
blessed
bishops
settled
the
faith
and
which
the
holy
council
held
at
ephesus
maintained
and
defined
anew
as
the
only
faith
and
i
have
never
understood
otherwise
than
as
the
right
or
only
true
orthodox
faith
hath
enjoined
he
says
at
the
latrocinium
when
i
declared
that
my
faith
was
conformable
to
the
decision
of
nic√¶a
confirmed
at
ephesus
they
demanded
that
i
should
add
some
words
to
it
and
i
fearing
to
act
contrary
to
the
decrees
of
the
first
council
of
ephesus
and
of
the
council
of
nic√¶a
desired
that
your
holy
council
might
be
made
acquainted
with
it
since
i
was
ready
to
submit
to
whatever
you
should
approve
dioscorus
states
the
matter
more
strongly
we
have
heard
he
says
what
this
council
of
ephesus
decreed
that
if
any
one
affirm
or
opine
anything
or
raise
any
question
beyond
the
creed
aforesaid
of
nic√¶a
he
is
to
be
condemned
it
is
remarkable
that
the
council
of
ephesus
which
laid
down
this
rule
had
itself
sanctioned
the
theotocos
an
addition
greater
perhaps
than
any
before
or
since
to
the
letter
of
the
primitive
faith
further
eutyches
appealed
to
scripture
and
denied
that
a
human
nature
was
there
given
to
our
lord
and
this
appeal
obliged
him
in
consequence
to
refuse
an
unconditional
assent
to
the
councils
and
fathers
though
he
so
confidently
spoke
about
them
at
other
times
it
was
urged
against
him
that
the
nicene
council
itself
had
introduced
into
the
creed
terms
have
never
found
in
scripture
he
said
according
to
one
of
the
priests
who
were
sent
to
him
there
are
two
natures
i
replied
is
the
consubstantiality
the
homo√ºsion
of
nic√¶a
be
found
in
the
scriptures
but
in
the
holy
fathers
who
well
understood
them
and
faithfully
expounded
them
accordingly
on
another
occasion
a
report
was
made
of
him
that
he
professed
himself
ready
to
assent
to
the
exposition
of
faith
made
by
the
holy
fathers
of
the
nicene
and
ephesine
councils
and
he
engaged
to
subscribe
their
interpretations
however
if
there
were
any
accidental
fault
or
error
in
any
expressions
which
they
made
this
he
would
neither
blame
nor
accept
but
only
search
the
scriptures
as
being
surer
than
the
expositions
of
the
fathers
that
since
the
time
of
the
incarnation
of
god
the
word
he
worshipped
one
nature
that
the
doctrine
that
our
lord
jesus
christ
came
of
two
natures
personally
united
this
it
was
that
he
had
learned
from
the
expositions
of
the
holy
fathers
nor
did
he
accept
if
ought
was
read
to
him
from
any
author
to
another
effect
because
the
holy
scriptures
as
he
said
were
better
than
the
teaching
of
the
fathers
this
appeal
to
the
scriptures
will
remind
us
of
what
has
lately
been
said
of
the
school
of
theodore
in
the
history
of
nestorianism
and
of
the
challenge
of
the
arians
to
avitus
before
the
gothic
king
it
had
also
been
the
characteristic
of
heresy
in
the
antecedent
period
hilary
brings
together
a
number
of
instances
in
point
from
the
history
of
marcellus
photinus
sabellius
montanus
and
manes
then
he
adds
they
all
speak
scripture
without
the
sense
of
scripture
and
profess
a
faith
without
faith
once
more
the
council
of
the
latrocinium
however
tyrannized
over
by
dioscorus
in
the
matter
of
flavian
certainly
did
acquit
eutyches
and
accept
his
doctrine
canonically
and
as
it
would
appear
cordially
though
their
change
at
chalcedon
and
the
subsequent
variations
of
the
east
make
it
a
matter
of
little
moment
how
they
decided
the
acts
of
constantinople
were
read
to
the
fathers
of
the
latrocinium
when
they
came
to
the
part
where
eusebius
of
doryl√¶um
the
accuser
of
eutyches
asked
him
whether
he
confessed
two
natures
after
the
incarnation
and
the
consubstantiality
according
to
the
flesh
the
fathers
broke
in
upon
the
reading
away
with
eusebius
burn
him
burn
him
alive
cut
him
in
two
as
he
divided
so
let
him
be
divided
the
council
seems
to
have
been
unanimous
with
the
exception
of
the
pope
legates
in
the
restoration
of
eutyches
a
more
complete
decision
can
hardly
be
imagined
it
is
true
the
whole
number
of
signatures
now
extant
one
hundred
and
eight
may
seem
small
out
of
a
thousand
the
number
of
sees
in
the
east
but
the
attendance
of
councils
always
bore
a
representative
character
the
whole
number
of
east
and
west
was
about
eighteen
hundred
yet
the
second
ecumenical
council
was
attended
by
only
one
hundred
and
fifty
which
is
but
a
twelfth
part
of
the
whole
number
the
third
council
by
about
two
hundred
or
a
ninth
the
council
of
nic√¶a
itself
numbered
only
three
hundred
and
eighteen
bishops
moreover
when
we
look
through
the
names
subscribed
to
the
synodal
decision
we
find
that
the
misbelief
or
misapprehension
or
weakness
to
which
this
great
offence
must
be
attributed
was
no
local
phenomenon
but
the
unanimous
sin
of
bishops
in
every
patriarchate
and
of
every
school
of
the
east
three
out
of
the
four
patriarchs
were
in
favour
of
the
heresiarch
the
fourth
being
on
his
trial
of
these
domnus
of
antioch
and
juvenal
of
jerusalem
acquitted
him
on
the
ground
of
his
confessing
the
faith
of
nic√¶a
and
ephesus
and
domnus
was
a
man
of
the
fairest
and
purest
character
and
originally
a
disciple
of
euthemius
however
inconsistent
on
this
occasion
and
in
former
steps
of
his
career
dioscorus
violent
and
bad
man
as
he
showed
himself
had
been
archdeacon
to
cyril
whom
he
attended
at
the
council
of
ephesus
and
was
on
this
occasion
supported
by
those
churches
which
had
so
nobly
stood
by
their
patriarch
athanasius
in
the
great
arian
conflict
these
three
patriarchs
were
supported
by
the
exarchs
of
ephesus
and
c√¶sarea
in
cappadocia
and
both
of
these
as
well
as
domnus
and
juvenal
were
supported
in
turn
by
their
subordinate
metropolitans
even
the
sees
under
the
influence
of
constantinople
which
was
the
remaining
sixth
division
of
the
east
took
part
with
eutyches
we
find
among
the
signatures
to
his
acquittal
the
bishops
of
dyrrachium
of
heraclea
in
macedonia
of
messene
in
the
peloponese
of
sebaste
in
armenia
of
tarsus
of
damascus
of
berytus
of
bostra
in
arabia
of
amida
in
mesopotamia
of
himeria
in
osrhoene
of
babylon
of
arsinoe
in
egypt
and
of
cyrene
the
bishops
of
palestine
of
macedonia
and
of
achaia
where
the
keen
eye
of
athanasius
had
detected
the
doctrine
in
its
germ
while
apollinarianism
was
but
growing
into
form
were
his
actual
partisans
another
barsumas
a
syrian
abbot
ignorant
of
greek
attended
the
latrocinium
as
the
representative
of
the
monks
of
his
nation
whom
he
formed
into
a
force
material
or
moral
of
a
thousand
strong
and
whom
at
that
infamous
assembly
he
cheered
on
to
the
murder
of
flavian
such
was
the
state
of
eastern
christendom
in
the
year
a
heresy
appealing
to
the
fathers
to
the
creed
and
above
all
to
scripture
was
by
a
general
council
professing
to
be
ecumenical
received
as
true
in
the
person
of
its
promulgator
if
the
east
could
determine
a
matter
of
faith
independently
of
the
west
certainly
the
monophysite
heresy
was
established
as
apostolic
truth
in
all
its
provinces
from
macedonia
to
egypt
there
has
been
a
time
in
the
history
of
christianity
when
it
had
been
athanasius
against
the
world
and
the
world
against
athanasius
the
need
and
straitness
of
the
church
had
been
great
and
one
man
was
raised
up
for
her
deliverance
in
this
second
necessity
who
was
the
destined
champion
of
her
who
can
not
fail
whence
did
he
come
and
what
was
his
name
he
came
with
an
augury
of
victory
upon
him
which
even
athanasius
could
not
show
it
was
leo
bishop
of
rome
leo
augury
of
success
which
even
athanasius
had
not
was
this
that
he
was
seated
in
the
chair
of
peter
and
the
heir
of
his
prerogatives
in
the
very
beginning
of
the
controversy
peter
chrysologus
had
urged
this
grave
consideration
upon
eutyches
himself
in
words
which
have
already
been
cited
i
exhort
you
my
venerable
brother
he
had
said
to
submit
yourself
in
everything
to
what
has
been
written
by
the
blessed
pope
of
rome
for
peter
who
lives
and
presides
in
his
own
see
gives
the
true
faith
to
those
who
seek
it
this
voice
had
come
from
ravenna
and
now
after
the
latrocinium
it
was
echoed
back
from
the
depths
of
syria
by
the
learned
theodoret
that
see
he
says
in
a
letter
to
one
of
the
pope
legates
has
the
office
of
heading
·º°Œ≥ŒµŒºŒøŒΩ·Ω∑Œ±ŒΩ
the
whole
churches
for
many
reasons
and
above
all
others
because
it
has
remained
free
of
the
communion
of
heretical
taint
and
no
one
of
heterodox
sentiments
hath
sat
in
it
but
it
hath
preserved
the
apostolic
grace
unsullied
and
a
third
testimony
in
encouragement
of
the
faithful
at
the
same
dark
moment
issued
from
the
imperial
court
of
the
west
we
are
bound
says
valentinian
to
the
emperor
of
the
east
to
preserve
inviolate
in
our
times
the
prerogative
of
particular
reverence
to
the
blessed
apostle
peter
that
the
most
blessed
bishop
of
rome
to
whom
antiquity
assigned
the
priesthood
over
all
Œ∫Œ±œÑ·Ω∞
œÄ·Ω±ŒΩœÑœâŒΩ
may
have
place
and
opportunity
of
judging
concerning
the
faith
and
the
priests
nor
had
leo
himself
been
wanting
at
the
same
time
in
the
confidence
he
had
obtained
from
the
most
blessed
peter
and
head
of
the
apostles
that
he
had
authority
to
defend
the
truth
for
the
peace
of
the
church
thus
leo
introduces
us
to
the
council
of
chalcedon
by
which
he
rescued
the
east
from
a
grave
heresy
the
council
met
on
the
of
october
and
was
attended
by
the
largest
number
of
bishops
of
any
council
before
or
since
some
say
by
as
many
as
six
hundred
and
thirty
of
these
only
four
came
from
the
west
two
roman
legates
and
two
africans
its
proceedings
were
opened
by
the
pope
legates
who
said
that
they
had
it
in
charge
from
the
bishop
of
rome
which
is
the
head
of
all
the
churches
to
demand
that
dioscorus
should
not
sit
on
the
ground
that
he
had
presumed
to
hold
a
council
without
the
authority
of
the
apostolic
see
which
had
never
been
done
nor
was
lawful
to
do
this
was
immediately
allowed
them
the
next
act
of
the
council
was
to
give
admission
to
theodoret
who
had
been
deposed
at
the
latrocinium
the
imperial
officers
present
urged
his
admission
on
the
ground
that
the
most
holy
archbishop
leo
hath
restored
him
to
the
episcopal
office
and
the
most
pious
emperor
hath
ordered
that
he
should
assist
at
the
holy
council
presently
a
charge
was
brought
forward
against
dioscorus
that
though
the
legates
had
presented
a
letter
from
the
pope
to
the
council
it
had
not
been
read
dioscorus
admitted
not
only
the
fact
but
its
relevancy
but
alleged
in
excuse
that
he
had
twice
ordered
it
to
be
read
in
vain
in
the
course
of
the
reading
of
the
acts
of
the
latrocinium
and
constantinople
a
number
of
bishops
moved
from
the
side
of
dioscorus
and
placed
themselves
with
the
opposite
party
when
peter
bishop
of
corinth
crossed
over
the
orientals
whom
he
joined
shouted
peter
thinks
as
does
peter
orthodox
bishop
welcome
in
the
second
session
it
was
the
duty
of
the
fathers
to
draw
up
a
confession
of
faith
condemnatory
of
the
heresy
a
committee
was
formed
for
the
purpose
and
the
creed
of
nic√¶a
and
constantinople
was
read
then
some
of
the
epistles
of
cyril
lastly
leo
tome
which
had
been
passed
over
in
silence
at
the
latrocinium
some
discussion
followed
upon
the
last
of
these
documents
but
at
length
the
bishops
cried
out
this
is
the
faith
of
the
fathers
this
is
the
faith
of
the
apostles
we
all
believe
thus
the
orthodox
believe
thus
anathema
to
him
who
does
not
believe
thus
peter
has
thus
spoken
through
leo
the
apostles
taught
thus
readings
from
the
other
fathers
followed
and
then
some
days
were
allowed
for
private
discussion
before
drawing
up
the
confession
of
faith
which
was
to
set
right
the
heterodoxy
of
the
latrocinium
during
the
interval
dioscorus
was
tried
and
condemned
sentence
was
pronounced
against
him
by
the
pope
legates
and
ran
thus
the
most
holy
archbishop
of
rome
leo
through
us
and
this
present
council
with
the
apostle
peter
who
is
the
rock
and
foundation
of
the
catholic
church
and
of
the
orthodox
faith
deprives
him
of
the
episcopal
dignity
and
every
sacerdotal
ministry
in
the
fourth
session
the
question
of
the
definition
of
faith
came
on
again
but
the
council
got
no
further
than
this
that
it
received
the
definitions
of
the
three
previous
ecumenical
councils
it
would
not
add
to
them
what
leo
required
one
hundred
and
sixty
bishops
however
subscribed
his
tome
in
the
fifth
session
the
question
came
on
once
more
some
sort
of
definition
of
faith
was
the
result
of
the
labours
of
the
committee
and
was
accepted
by
the
great
majority
of
the
council
the
bishops
cried
out
we
are
all
satisfied
with
the
definition
it
is
the
faith
of
the
fathers
anathema
to
him
who
thinks
otherwise
drive
out
the
nestorians
when
objectors
appeared
anatolius
the
new
patriarch
of
constantinople
asked
did
not
every
one
yesterday
consent
to
the
definition
of
faith
on
which
the
bishops
answered
every
one
consented
we
do
not
believe
otherwise
it
is
the
faith
of
the
fathers
let
it
be
set
down
that
holy
mary
is
the
mother
of
god
let
this
be
added
to
the
creed
put
out
the
nestorians
the
objectors
were
the
pope
legates
supported
by
a
certain
number
of
orientals
those
latins
understood
full
well
what
and
what
alone
was
the
true
expression
of
orthodox
doctrine
under
the
emergency
of
the
existing
heresy
they
had
been
instructed
to
induce
the
council
to
pass
a
declaration
to
the
effect
that
christ
was
not
only
of
but
in
two
natures
however
they
did
not
enter
upon
disputation
on
the
point
but
they
used
a
more
intelligible
argument
if
the
fathers
did
not
consent
to
the
letter
of
the
blessed
bishop
leo
they
would
leave
the
council
and
go
home
the
imperial
officers
took
the
part
of
the
legates
the
council
however
persisted
every
one
approved
the
definition
let
it
be
subscribed
he
who
refuses
to
subscribe
it
is
a
heretic
they
even
proceeded
to
refer
it
to
divine
inspiration
the
officers
asked
if
they
received
leo
tome
they
answered
that
they
had
subscribed
it
but
that
they
would
not
introduce
its
contents
into
their
definition
of
faith
we
are
for
no
other
definition
they
said
nothing
is
wanting
in
this
notwithstanding
the
pope
legates
gained
their
point
through
the
support
of
the
emperor
marcian
who
had
succeeded
theodosius
a
fresh
committee
was
obtained
under
the
threat
that
if
they
resisted
the
council
should
be
transferred
to
the
west
some
voices
were
raised
against
this
measure
the
cries
were
repeated
against
the
roman
party
they
are
nestorians
let
them
go
to
rome
the
imperial
officers
remonstrated
dioscorus
said
two
natures
leo
says
natures
which
will
you
follow
leo
or
dioscorus
on
their
answering
leo
they
continued
well
then
add
to
the
definition
according
to
the
judgment
of
our
most
holy
leo
nothing
more
was
to
be
said
the
committee
immediately
proceeded
to
their
work
and
in
a
short
time
returned
to
the
assembly
with
such
a
definition
as
the
pope
required
after
reciting
the
creed
of
nic√¶a
and
constantinople
it
observes
this
creed
were
sufficient
for
the
perfect
knowledge
of
religion
but
the
enemies
of
the
truth
have
invented
novel
expressions
and
therefore
it
proceeds
to
state
the
faith
more
explicitly
when
this
was
read
through
the
bishops
all
exclaimed
this
is
the
faith
of
the
fathers
we
all
follow
it
and
thus
ended
the
controversy
once
for
all
the
council
after
its
termination
addressed
a
letter
to
leo
in
it
the
fathers
acknowledge
him
as
constituted
interpreter
of
the
voice
of
blessed
peter
with
an
allusion
to
peter
confession
in
matthew
and
speak
of
him
as
the
very
one
commissioned
with
the
guardianship
of
the
vine
by
the
saviour
such
is
the
external
aspect
of
those
proceedings
by
which
the
catholic
faith
has
been
established
in
christendom
against
the
monophysites
that
the
definition
passed
at
chalcedon
is
the
apostolic
truth
once
delivered
to
the
saints
is
most
firmly
to
be
received
from
faith
in
that
overruling
providence
which
is
by
special
promise
extended
over
the
acts
of
the
church
moreover
that
it
is
in
simple
accordance
with
the
faith
of
athanasius
gregory
nazianzen
and
all
the
other
fathers
will
be
evident
to
the
theological
student
in
proportion
as
he
becomes
familiar
with
their
works
but
the
historical
account
of
the
council
is
this
that
a
formula
which
the
creed
did
not
contain
which
the
fathers
did
not
unanimously
witness
and
which
some
eminent
saints
had
almost
in
set
terms
opposed
which
the
whole
east
refused
as
a
symbol
not
once
but
twice
patriarch
by
patriarch
metropolitan
by
metropolitan
first
by
the
mouth
of
above
a
hundred
then
by
the
mouth
of
above
six
hundred
of
its
bishops
and
refused
upon
the
grounds
of
its
being
an
addition
to
the
creed
was
forced
upon
the
council
not
indeed
as
being
such
an
addition
yet
on
the
other
hand
not
for
subscription
merely
but
for
acceptance
as
a
definition
of
faith
under
the
sanction
of
an
anathema
forced
on
the
council
by
the
resolution
of
the
pope
of
the
day
acting
through
his
legates
and
supported
by
the
civil
power
it
can
not
be
supposed
that
such
a
transaction
would
approve
itself
to
the
churches
of
egypt
and
the
event
showed
it
they
disowned
the
authority
of
the
council
and
called
its
adherents
chalcedonians
and
synodites
for
here
was
the
west
tyrannizing
over
the
east
forcing
it
into
agreement
with
itself
resolved
to
have
one
and
one
only
form
of
words
rejecting
the
definition
of
faith
which
the
east
had
drawn
up
in
council
bidding
it
and
making
it
frame
another
dealing
peremptorily
and
sternly
with
the
assembled
bishops
and
casting
contempt
on
the
most
sacred
traditions
of
egypt
what
was
eutyches
to
them
he
might
be
guilty
or
innocent
they
gave
him
up
dioscorus
had
given
him
up
at
chalcedon
they
did
not
agree
with
him
he
was
an
extreme
man
they
would
not
call
themselves
by
human
titles
they
were
not
eutychians
eutyches
was
not
their
master
but
athanasius
and
cyril
were
their
doctors
the
two
great
lights
of
their
church
the
two
greatest
and
most
successful
polemical
fathers
that
christianity
had
seen
had
both
pronounced
one
nature
incarnate
though
allowing
two
before
the
incarnation
and
though
leo
and
his
council
had
not
gone
so
far
as
to
deny
this
phrase
they
had
proceeded
to
say
what
was
the
contrary
to
it
to
explain
away
to
overlay
the
truth
by
defining
that
the
incarnate
saviour
was
in
two
natures
at
ephesus
it
had
been
declared
that
the
creed
should
not
be
touched
the
chalcedonian
fathers
had
not
literally
but
virtually
added
to
it
by
subscribing
tome
and
promulgating
their
definition
of
faith
they
had
added
what
might
be
called
the
creed
of
pope
leo
it
is
remarkable
as
has
been
just
stated
that
dioscorus
wicked
man
as
he
was
in
act
was
of
the
moderate
or
middle
school
in
doctrine
as
the
violent
and
able
severus
after
him
and
from
the
first
the
great
body
of
the
protesting
party
disowned
eutyches
whose
form
of
the
heresy
took
refuge
in
armenia
where
it
remains
to
this
day
the
armenians
alone
were
pure
eutychians
and
so
zealously
such
that
they
innovated
on
the
ancient
and
recognized
custom
of
mixing
water
with
the
wine
in
the
holy
eucharist
and
consecrated
the
wine
by
itself
in
token
of
the
one
nature
as
they
considered
of
the
christ
elsewhere
both
name
and
doctrine
of
eutyches
were
abjured
the
heretical
bodies
in
egypt
and
syria
took
a
title
from
their
special
tenet
and
formed
the
monophysite
communion
their
theology
was
at
once
simple
and
specious
they
based
it
upon
the
illustration
which
is
familiar
to
us
in
the
athanasian
creed
and
which
had
been
used
by
gregory
nazianzen
cyril
augustine
vincent
of
lerins
not
to
say
leo
himself
they
argued
that
as
body
and
soul
made
up
one
man
so
god
and
man
made
up
but
one
though
one
compound
nature
in
christ
it
might
have
been
charitably
hoped
that
their
difference
from
the
catholics
had
been
a
simple
matter
of
words
as
it
is
allowed
by
vigilius
of
thapsus
really
to
have
been
in
many
cases
but
their
refusal
to
obey
the
voice
of
the
church
was
a
token
of
real
error
in
their
faith
and
their
implicit
heterodoxy
is
proved
by
their
connexion
in
spite
of
themselves
with
the
extreme
or
ultra
party
whom
they
so
vehemently
disowned
it
is
very
observable
that
ingenious
as
is
their
theory
and
sometimes
perplexing
to
a
disputant
the
monophysites
never
could
shake
themselves
free
of
the
eutychians
and
though
they
could
draw
intelligible
lines
on
paper
between
the
two
doctrines
yet
in
fact
by
a
hidden
fatality
their
partisans
were
ever
running
into
or
forming
alliance
with
the
anathematized
extreme
thus
peter
the
fuller
the
theopaschite
eutychian
is
at
one
time
in
alliance
with
peter
the
stammerer
who
advocated
the
henoticon
which
was
monophysite
the
acephali
though
separating
from
the
latter
peter
for
that
advocacy
and
accused
by
leontius
of
being
gaianites
eutychians
are
considered
by
facundus
as
monophysites
timothy
the
cat
who
is
said
to
have
agreed
with
dioscorus
and
peter
the
stammerer
who
signed
the
henoticon
that
is
with
two
monophysite
patriarchs
is
said
nevertheless
according
to
anastasius
to
have
maintained
the
extreme
tenet
that
the
divinity
is
the
sole
nature
of
christ
severus
according
to
anastasius
symbolized
with
the
phantasiasts
eutychians
yet
he
is
more
truly
according
to
leontius
the
chief
doctor
and
leader
of
the
monophysites
and
at
one
time
there
was
an
union
though
temporary
between
the
theodosians
monophysites
and
the
gaianites
such
a
division
of
an
heretical
party
into
the
maintainers
of
an
extreme
and
a
moderate
view
perspicuous
and
plausible
on
paper
yet
in
fact
unreal
impracticable
and
hopeless
was
no
new
phenomenon
in
the
history
of
the
church
as
eutyches
put
forward
an
extravagant
tenet
which
was
first
corrected
into
the
monophysite
and
then
relapsed
hopelessly
into
the
doctrine
of
the
phantasiasts
and
the
theopaschites
so
had
arius
been
superseded
by
the
eusebians
and
had
revived
in
eunomius
and
as
the
moderate
eusebians
had
formed
the
great
body
of
the
dissentients
from
the
nicene
council
so
did
the
monophysites
include
the
mass
of
those
who
protested
against
chalcedon
and
as
the
eusebians
had
been
moderate
in
creed
yet
unscrupulous
in
act
so
were
the
monophysites
and
as
the
eusebians
were
ever
running
individually
into
pure
arianism
so
did
the
monophysites
run
into
pure
eutychianism
and
as
the
monophysites
set
themselves
against
pope
leo
so
had
the
eusebians
with
even
less
provocation
withstood
and
complained
of
pope
julius
in
like
manner
the
apollinarians
had
divided
into
two
sects
one
with
timotheus
going
the
whole
length
of
the
inferences
which
the
tenet
of
their
master
involved
and
the
more
cautious
or
timid
party
making
an
unintelligible
stand
with
valentinus
again
in
the
history
of
nestorianism
though
it
admitted
less
opportunity
for
division
of
opinion
the
see
of
rome
was
with
cyril
in
one
extreme
nestorius
in
the
other
and
between
them
the
great
eastern
party
headed
by
john
of
antioch
and
theodoret
not
heretical
but
for
a
time
dissatisfied
with
the
council
of
ephesus
the
nestorian
heresy
i
have
said
gave
less
opportunity
for
doctrinal
varieties
than
the
heresy
of
eutyches
its
spirit
was
rationalizing
and
had
the
qualities
which
go
with
rationalism
when
cast
out
of
the
roman
empire
it
addressed
itself
as
we
have
seen
to
a
new
and
rich
field
of
exertion
got
possession
of
an
established
church
with
the
civil
government
adopted
secular
fashions
and
by
whatever
means
pushed
itself
out
into
an
empire
apparently
though
it
requires
a
very
intimate
knowledge
of
its
history
to
speak
except
conjecturally
it
was
a
political
power
rather
than
a
dogma
and
despised
the
science
of
theology
eutychianism
on
the
other
hand
was
mystical
severe
enthusiastic
with
the
exception
of
severus
and
one
or
two
more
it
was
supported
by
little
polemical
skill
it
had
little
hold
upon
the
intellectual
greeks
of
syria
and
asia
minor
but
flourished
in
egypt
which
was
far
behind
the
east
in
civilization
and
among
the
native
syrians
nestorianism
like
arianism
before
it
was
a
cold
religion
and
more
fitted
for
the
schools
than
for
the
many
but
the
monophysites
carried
the
people
with
them
like
modern
jansenism
and
unlike
nestorianism
the
monophysites
were
famous
for
their
austerities
they
have
or
had
five
lents
in
the
year
during
which
laity
as
well
as
clergy
abstain
not
only
from
flesh
and
eggs
but
from
wine
oil
and
fish
monachism
was
a
characteristic
part
of
their
ecclesiastical
system
their
bishops
and
maphrian
or
patriarch
were
always
taken
from
the
monks
who
are
even
said
to
have
worn
an
iron
shirt
or
breastplate
as
a
part
of
their
monastic
habit
severus
patriarch
of
antioch
at
the
end
of
the
fifth
century
has
already
been
mentioned
as
an
exception
to
the
general
character
of
the
monophysites
and
by
his
learning
and
ability
may
be
accounted
the
founder
of
its
theology
their
cause
however
had
been
undertaken
by
the
emperors
themselves
before
him
for
the
first
thirty
years
after
the
council
of
chalcedon
the
protesting
church
of
egypt
had
been
the
scene
of
continued
tumult
and
bloodshed
dioscorus
had
been
popular
with
the
people
for
his
munificence
in
spite
of
the
extreme
laxity
of
his
morals
and
for
a
while
the
imperial
government
failed
in
obtaining
the
election
of
a
catholic
successor
at
length
proterius
a
man
of
fair
character
and
the
of
dioscorus
on
his
absence
at
chalcedon
was
chosen
consecrated
and
enthroned
but
the
people
rose
against
the
civil
authorities
and
the
military
coming
to
their
defence
were
attacked
with
stones
and
pursued
into
a
church
where
they
were
burned
alive
by
the
mob
next
the
popular
leaders
prepared
to
intercept
the
supplies
of
grain
which
were
destined
for
constantinople
and
a
defensive
retaliation
taking
place
alexandria
was
starved
then
a
force
of
two
thousand
men
was
sent
for
the
restoration
of
order
who
permitted
themselves
in
scandalous
excesses
towards
the
women
of
alexandria
proterius
life
was
attempted
and
he
was
obliged
to
be
attended
by
a
guard
the
bishops
of
egypt
would
not
submit
to
him
two
of
his
own
clergy
who
afterward
succeeded
him
timothy
and
peter
seceded
and
were
joined
by
four
or
five
of
the
bishops
and
by
the
mass
of
the
population
and
the
catholic
patriarch
was
left
without
a
communion
in
alexandria
he
held
a
council
and
condemned
the
schismatics
and
the
emperor
seconding
his
efforts
sent
them
out
of
the
country
and
enforced
the
laws
against
the
eutychians
an
external
quiet
succeeded
then
marcian
died
and
then
forthwith
timothy
the
cat
made
his
appearance
again
first
in
egypt
then
in
alexandria
the
people
rose
in
his
favour
and
carried
in
triumph
their
persecuted
champion
to
the
great
c√¶sarean
church
where
he
was
consecrated
patriarch
by
two
deprived
bishops
who
had
been
put
out
of
their
sees
whether
by
a
council
of
egypt
or
of
palestine
timothy
now
raised
to
the
episcopal
rank
began
to
create
a
new
succession
he
ordained
bishops
for
the
churches
of
egypt
and
drove
into
exile
those
who
were
in
possession
the
imperial
troops
who
had
been
stationed
in
upper
egypt
returned
to
alexandria
the
mob
rose
again
broke
into
the
church
where
proterius
was
in
prayer
and
murdered
him
a
general
ejectment
of
the
catholic
clergy
throughout
egypt
followed
on
their
betaking
themselves
to
constantinople
to
the
new
emperor
timothy
and
his
party
addressed
him
also
they
quoted
the
fathers
and
demanded
the
abrogation
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
next
they
demanded
a
conference
the
catholics
said
that
what
was
once
done
could
not
be
undone
their
opponents
agreed
to
this
and
urged
it
as
their
very
argument
against
chalcedon
that
it
added
to
the
faith
and
reversed
former
decisions
after
a
rule
of
three
years
timothy
was
driven
out
and
catholicism
restored
but
then
in
turn
the
monophysites
rallied
and
this
state
of
warfare
and
alternate
success
continued
for
thirty
years
at
length
the
imperial
government
wearied
out
with
a
dispute
which
was
interminable
came
to
the
conclusion
that
the
only
way
of
restoring
peace
to
the
church
was
to
abandon
the
council
of
chalcedon
in
the
year
was
published
the
famous
or
pacification
of
zeno
in
which
the
emperor
took
upon
himself
to
determine
a
matter
of
faith
the
henoticon
declared
that
no
symbol
of
faith
but
that
of
the
nicene
creed
commonly
so
called
should
be
received
in
the
churches
it
anathematized
the
opposite
heresies
of
nestorius
and
eutyches
and
it
was
silent
on
the
question
of
the
one
or
two
natures
after
the
incarnation
this
middle
measure
had
the
various
effects
which
might
be
anticipated
it
united
the
great
body
of
the
eastern
bishops
who
readily
relaxed
into
the
vague
profession
of
doctrine
from
which
they
had
been
roused
by
the
authority
of
leo
all
the
eastern
bishops
signed
this
imperial
formulary
but
this
unanimity
of
the
east
was
purchased
by
a
breach
with
the
west
for
the
popes
cut
off
the
communication
between
greeks
and
latins
for
years
on
the
other
hand
the
more
zealous
monophysites
disgusted
at
their
leaders
for
accepting
what
they
considered
an
unjustifiable
compromise
split
off
from
the
eastern
churches
and
formed
a
sect
by
themselves
which
remained
without
bishops
for
three
hundred
years
when
at
length
they
were
received
back
into
the
communion
of
the
catholic
church
dreary
and
waste
was
the
condition
of
the
church
and
forlorn
her
prospects
at
the
period
which
we
have
been
reviewing
after
the
brief
triumph
which
attended
the
conversion
of
constantine
trouble
and
trial
had
returned
upon
her
her
imperial
protectors
were
failing
in
power
or
in
faith
strange
forms
of
evil
were
rising
in
the
distance
and
were
thronging
for
the
conflict
there
was
but
one
spot
in
the
whole
of
christendom
one
voice
in
the
whole
episcopate
to
which
the
faithful
turned
in
hope
in
that
miserable
day
in
the
year
in
the
pontificate
of
gelasius
the
whole
of
the
east
was
in
the
hands
of
traitors
to
chalcedon
and
the
whole
of
the
west
under
the
tyranny
of
the
open
enemies
of
nic√¶a
italy
was
the
prey
of
robbers
mercenary
bands
had
overrun
its
territory
and
barbarians
were
seizing
on
its
farms
and
settling
in
its
villas
the
peasants
were
thinned
by
famine
and
pestilence
tuscany
might
be
even
said
as
gelasius
words
it
to
contain
scarcely
a
single
inhabitant
odoacer
was
sinking
before
theodoric
and
the
pope
was
changing
one
arian
master
for
another
and
as
if
one
heresy
were
not
enough
pelagianism
was
spreading
with
the
connivance
of
the
bishops
in
the
territory
of
picenum
in
the
north
of
the
dismembered
empire
the
britons
had
first
been
infected
by
pelagianism
and
now
were
dispossessed
by
the
heathen
saxons
the
armoricans
still
preserved
a
witness
of
catholicism
in
the
west
of
gaul
but
picardy
champagne
and
the
neighbouring
provinces
where
some
remnant
of
its
supremacy
had
been
found

arian
kingdoms
of
burgundy
in

and
of
the
visigoths
in

and

africa
was
in
still
more
deplorable
condition
under
the
cruel
sway
of
the
vandal
gundamond
the
people
indeed
uncorrupted
by
the
heresy
but
their
clergy
in
exile
and
their
worship
suspended
while
such
was
the
state
of
the
latins
what
had
happened
in
the
east
acacius
the
patriarch
of
constantinople
had
secretly
taken
part
against
the
council
of
chalcedon
and
was
under
papal
excommunication
nearly
the
whole
east
had
sided
with
acacius
and
a
schism
had
begun
between
east
and
west
which
lasted
as
i
have
above
stated
for
years
the
henoticon
was
in
force
and
at
the
imperial
command
had
been
signed
by
all
the
patriarchs
and
bishops
throughout
the
eastern
empire
in
armenia
the
churches
were
ripening
for
the
pure
eutychianism
which
they
adopted
in
the
following
century
and
in
egypt
the
acephali
already
separated
from
the
monophysite
patriarch
were
extending
in
the
east
and
west
of
the
country
and
preferred
the
loss
of
the
episcopal
succession
to
the
reception
of
the
council
of
chalcedon
and
while
monophysites
or
their
favourers
occupied
the
churches
of
the
eastern
empire
nestorianism
was
making
progress
in
the
territories
beyond
it
barsumas
had
held
the
see
of
nisibis
theodore
was
read
in
the
schools
of
persia
and
the
successive
catholici
of
seleucia
had
abolished
monachism
and
were
secularizing
the
clergy
if
then
there
is
now
a
form
of
christianity
such
that
it
extends
throughout
the
world
though
with
varying
measures
of
prominence
or
prosperity
in
separate
places
that
it
lies
under
the
power
of
sovereigns
and
magistrates
in
various
ways
alien
to
its
faith
that
flourishing
nations
and
great
empires
professing
or
tolerating
the
christian
name
lie
over
against
it
as
antagonists
that
schools
of
philosophy
and
learning
are
supporting
theories
and
following
out
conclusions
hostile
to
it
and
establishing
an
exegetical
system
subversive
of
its
scriptures
that
it
has
lost
whole
churches
by
schism
and
is
now
opposed
by
powerful
communions
once
part
of
itself
that
it
has
been
altogether
or
almost
driven
from
some
countries
that
in
others
its
line
of
teachers
is
overlaid
its
flocks
oppressed
its
churches
occupied
its
property
held
by
what
may
be
called
a
duplicate
succession
that
in
others
its
members
are
degenerate
and
corrupt
and
are
surpassed
in
conscientiousness
and
in
virtue
as
in
gifts
of
intellect
by
the
very
heretics
whom
it
condemns
that
heresies
are
rife
and
bishops
negligent
within
its
own
pale
and
that
amid
its
disorders
and
its
fears
there
is
but
one
voice
for
whose
decisions
the
peoples
wait
with
trust
one
name
and
one
see
to
which
they
look
with
hope
and
that
name
peter
and
that
see
rome
such
a
religion
is
not
unlike
the
christianity
of
the
fifth
and
sixth
centuries

of

wonderful

i

might

simply
from

as
to
her
devotional
aspect
cardinal
wiseman
has
shown
its
identity
in
the
fifth
compared
with
the
nineteenth
century
in
an
article
of
the
quoted
in
part
in

indeed
it
is
confessed
on
all
hands
as
by
middleton
gibbon
that
from
the
time
of
constantine
to
their
own
the
system
and
the
phenomena
of
worship
in
christendom
from
moscow
to
spain
and
from
ireland
to
chili
is
one
and
the
same
i
have
myself
paralleled
medieval
europe
with
modern
belgium
or
italy
in
point
of
ethical
character
in

of
anglicans
vol

referring
the
identity
to
the
operation
of
a
principle
insisted
on
presently
the
supremacy
of
faith
and
so
again
as
to
the
system
of
catholic
doctrine
the
type
of
the
religion
remains
the
same
because
it
has
developed
according
to
the
analogy
of
faith
as
is
observed
in
the
idea
of
the
blessed
virgin
was
as
it
were
in
the
church
of
rome
as
time
went
on
but
so
were
the
christian
ideas
as
that
of
the
blessed
eucharist
chapter
vii
application
of
the
second
note
of
a
true
development
continuity
of
principles
it
appears
then
that
there
has
been
a
certain
general
type
of
christianity
in
every
age
by
which
it
is
known
at
first
sight
differing
from
itself
only
as
what
is
young
differs
from
what
is
mature
or
as
found
in
europe
or
in
america
so
that
it
is
named
at
once
and
without
hesitation
as
forms
of
nature
are
recognized
by
experts
in
physical
science
or
as
some
work
of
literature
or
art
is
assigned
to
its
right
author
by
the
critic
difficult
as
may
be
the
analysis
of
that
specific
impression
by
which
he
is
enabled
to
do
so
and
it
appears
that
this
type
has
remained
entire
from
first
to
last
in
spite
of
that
process
of
development
which
seems
to
be
attributed
by
all
parties
for
good
or
bad
to
the
doctrines
rites
and
usages
in
which
christianity
consists
or
in
other
words
that
the
changes
which
have
taken
place
in
christianity
have
not
been
such
as
to
destroy
that
type
that
is
that
they
are
not
corruptions
because
they
are
consistent
with
that
type
here
then
in
the
of
we
have
a
first
note
of
the
fidelity
of
the
existing
developments
of
christianity
let
us
now
proceed
to
a
second
principles
of
when
developments
in
christianity
are
spoken
of
it
is
sometimes
supposed
that
they
are
deductions
and
diversions
made
at
random
according
to
accident
or
the
caprice
of
individuals
whereas
it
is
because
they
have
been
conducted
all
along
on
definite
and
continuous
principles
that
the
type
of
the
religion
has
remained
from
first
to
last
unalterable
what
then
are
the
principles
under
which
the
developments
have
been
made
i
will
enumerate
some
obvious
ones
they
must
be
many
and
positive
as
well
as
obvious
if
they
are
to
be
effective
thus
the
society
of
friends
seems
in
the
course
of
years
to
have
changed
its
type
in
consequence
of
its
scarcity
of
principles
a
fanatical
spiritualism
and
an
intense
secularity
types
simply
contrary
to
each
other
being
alike
consistent
with
its
main
principle
forms
of
worship
are
antichristian
christianity
on
the
other
hand
has
principles
so
distinctive
numerous
various
and
operative
as
to
be
unlike
any
other
religious
ethical
or
political
system
that
the
world
has
ever
seen
unlike
not
only
in
character
but
in
persistence
in
that
character
i
can
not
attempt
here
to
enumerate
more
than
a
few
by
way
of
illustration
for
the
convenience
of
arrangement
i
will
consider
the
incarnation
the
central
truth
of
the
gospel
and
the
source
whence
we
are
to
draw
out
its
principles
this
great
doctrine
is
unequivocally
announced
in
numberless
passages
of
the
new
testament
especially
by
john
and
paul
as
is
familiar
to
us
all
the
word
was
made
flesh
and
dwelt
among
us
full
of
grace
and
truth
that
which
was
from
the
beginning
which
we
have
heard
which
we
have
seen
with
our
eyes
which
we
have
looked
upon
and
our
hands
have
handled
of
the
word
of
life
that
declare
we
to
you
for
ye
know
the
grace
of
our
lord
jesus
christ
that
though
he
was
rich
yet
for
your
sakes
he
became
poor
that
ye
through
his
poverty
might
be
rich
not
i
but
christ
liveth
in
me
and
the
life
which
i
now
live
in
the
flesh
i
live
by
the
faith
of
the
son
of
god
who
loved
me
and
gave
himself
for
me
in
such
passages
as
these
we
have
the
principle
of
that
is
supernatural
truths
irrevocably
committed
to
human
language
imperfect
because
it
is
human
but
definitive
and
necessary
because
given
from
above
the
principle
of
which
is
the
correlative
of
dogma
being
the
absolute
acceptance
of
the
divine
word
with
an
internal
assent
in
opposition
to
the
informations
if
such
of
sight
and
reason
faith
being
an
act
of
the
intellect
opens
a
way
for
inquiry
comparison
and
inference
that
is
for
science
in
religion
in
subservience
to
itself
this
is
the
principle
of
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
is
the
announcement
of
a
divine
gift
conveyed
in
a
material
and
visible
medium
it
being
thus
that
heaven
and
earth
are
in
the
incarnation
united
that
is
it
establishes
in
the
very
idea
of
christianity
the
principle
as
its
characteristic
another
principle
involved
in
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
viewed
as
taught
or
as
dogmatic
is
the
necessary
use
of
language
of
the
text
of
scripture
in
a
second
or
words
must
be
made
to
express
new
ideas
and
are
invested
with
a
sacramental
office
it
is
our
lord
intention
in
his
incarnation
to
make
us
what
he
is
himself
this
is
the
principle
of
which
is
not
only
holy
but
sanctifying
it
can
not
elevate
and
change
us
without
mortifying
our
lower
nature
here
is
the
principle
of
and
involved
in
this
death
of
the
natural
man
is
necessarily
a
revelation
of
the
of
in
corroboration
of
the
forebodings
of
conscience
also
by
the
fact
of
an
incarnation
we
are
taught
that
matter
is
an
essential
part
of
us
and
as
well
as
mind
is
of
here
are
nine
specimens
of
christian
principles
out
of
the
many
which
might
be
enumerated
and
will
any
one
say
that
they
have
not
been
retained
in
vigorous
action
in
the
church
at
all
times
amid
whatever
development
of
doctrine
christianity
has
experienced
so
as
even
to
be
the
very
instruments
of
that
development
and
as
patent
and
as
operative
in
the
latin
and
greek
christianity
of
this
day
as
they
were
in
the
beginning
this
continuous
identity
of
principles
in
ecclesiastical
action
has
been
seen
in
part
in
treating
of
the
note
of
unity
of
type
and
will
be
seen
also
in
the
notes
which
follow
however
as
some
direct
account
of
them
in
illustration
may
be
desirable
i
will
single
out
four
as
specimens
faith
theology
scripture
and
dogma
of
this
principle
which
as
we
have
already
seen
was
so
great
a
jest
to
celsus
and
julian
is
of
the
following
kind
that
belief
in
christianity
is
in
itself
better
than
unbelief
that
faith
though
an
intellectual
action
is
ethical
in
its
origin
that
it
is
safer
to
believe
that
we
must
begin
with
believing
that
as
for
the
reasons
of
believing
they
are
for
the
most
part
implicit
and
need
be
but
slightly
recognized
by
the
mind
that
is
under
their
influence
that
they
consist
moreover
rather
of
presumptions
and
ventures
after
the
truth
than
of
accurate
and
complete
proofs
and
that
probable
arguments
under
the
scrutiny
and
sanction
of
a
prudent
judgment
are
sufficient
for
conclusions
which
we
even
embrace
as
most
certain
and
turn
to
the
most
important
uses
antagonistic
to
this
is
the
principle
that
doctrines
are
only
so
far
to
be
considered
true
as
they
are
logically
demonstrated
this
is
the
assertion
of
locke
who
says
in
defence
of
it
whatever
god
hath
revealed
is
certainly
true
no
doubt
can
be
made
of
it
this
is
the
proper
object
of
faith
but
whether
it
be
a
divine
revelation
or
no
reason
must
judge
now
if
he
merely
means
that
proofs
can
be
given
for
revelation
and
that
reason
comes
in
logical
order
before
faith
such
a
doctrine
is
in
no
sense
uncatholic
but
he
certainly
holds
that
for
an
individual
to
act
on
faith
without
proof
or
to
make
faith
a
personal
principle
of
conduct
for
themselves
without
waiting
till
they
have
got
their
reasons
accurately
drawn
out
and
serviceable
for
controversy
is
enthusiastic
and
absurd
how
a
man
may
know
whether
he
be
a
lover
of
truth
for
truth
sake
is
worth
inquiry
and
i
think
there
is
this
one
unerring
mark
of
it
viz
the
not
entertaining
any
proposition
with
greater
assurance
than
the
proofs
it
is
built
upon
will
warrant
whoever
goes
beyond
this
measure
of
assent
it
is
plain
receives
not
truth
in
the
love
of
it
loves
not
truth
for
truth
sake
but
for
some
other
it
does
not
seem
to
have
struck
him
that
our
may
be
the
desire
to
please
our
maker
and
that
the
defect
of
scientific
proof
may
be
made
up
to
our
reason
by
our
love
of
him
it
does
not
seem
to
have
struck
him
that
such
a
philosophy
as
his
cut
off
from
the
possibility
and
the
privilege
of
faith
all
but
the
educated
few
all
but
the
learned
the
the
men
of
practised
intellects
and
balanced
minds
men
who
had
leisure
who
had
opportunities
of
consulting
others
and
kind
and
wise
friends
to
whom
they
deferred
how
could
a
religion
ever
be
catholic
if
it
was
to
be
called
credulity
or
enthusiasm
in
the
multitude
to
use
those
ready
instruments
of
belief
which
alone
providence
had
put
into
their
power
on
such
philosophy
as
this
were
it
generally
received
no
great
work
ever
would
have
been
done
for
glory
and
the
welfare
of
man
the
enthusiasm
against
which
locke
writes
may
do
much
harm
and
act
at
times
absurdly
but
calculation
never
made
a
hero
however
it
is
not
to
our
present
purpose
to
examine
this
theory
and
i
have
done
so
elsewhere
here
i
have
but
to
show
the
unanimity
of
catholics
ancient
as
well
as
modern
in
their
absolute
rejection
of
it
for
instance
it
is
the
very
objection
urged
by
celsus
that
christians
were
but
parallel
to
the
credulous
victims
of
jugglers
or
of
devotees
who
itinerated
through
the
pagan
population
he
says
that
some
do
not
even
wish
to
give
or
to
receive
a
reason
for
their
faith
but
say
not
inquire
but
believe
and
faith
will
save
thee
and
bad
thing
is
the
world
wisdom
and
foolishness
is
a
good
how
does
origen
answer
the
charge
by
denying
the
fact
and
speaking
of
the
reason
of
each
individual
as
demonstrating
the
divinity
of
the
scriptures
and
faith
as
coming
after
that
argumentative
process
as
it
is
now
popular
to
maintain
far
from
it
he
grants
the
fact
alleged
against
the
church
and
defends
it
he
observes
that
considering
the
engagements
and
the
necessary
ignorance
of
the
multitude
of
men
it
is
a
very
happy
circumstance
that
a
substitute
is
provided
for
those
philosophical
exercises
which
christianity
allows
and
encourages
but
does
not
impose
on
the
individual
which
he
asks
is
the
better
for
them
to
believe
without
reason
and
thus
to
reform
any
how
and
gain
a
benefit
from
their
belief
in
the
punishment
of
sinners
and
the
reward
of
or
to
refuse
to
be
converted
on
mere
belief
or
except
they
devote
themselves
to
an
intellectual
inquiry
such
a
provision
then
is
a
mark
of
divine
wisdom
and
mercy
in
like
manner
iren√¶us
after
observing
that
the
jews
had
the
evidence
of
prophecy
which
the
gentiles
had
not
and
that
to
the
latter
it
was
a
foreign
teaching
and
a
new
doctrine
to
be
told
that
the
gods
of
the
gentiles
were
not
only
not
gods
but
were
idols
of
devils
and
that
in
consequence
paul
laboured
more
upon
them
as
needing
it
more
adds
on
the
other
hand
the
faith
of
the
gentiles
is
thereby
shown
to
be
more
generous
who
followed
the
word
of
god
without
the
assistance
of
scriptures
to
believe
on
less
evidence
was
generous
faith
not
enthusiasm
and
so
again
eusebius
while
he
contends
of
course
that
christians
are
influenced
by
no
irrational
faith
that
is
by
a
faith
which
is
capable
of
a
logical
basis
fully
allows
that
in
the
individual
believing
it
is
not
necessarily
or
ordinarily
based
upon
argument
and
maintains
that
it
is
connected
with
that
very
hope
and
inclusively
with
that
desire
of
the
things
beloved
which
locke
in
the
above
extract
considers
incompatible
with
the
love
of
truth
what
do
we
find
he
says
but
that
the
whole
life
of
man
is
suspended
on
these
two
hope
and
faith
i
do
not
mean
of
course
that
the
fathers
were
opposed
to
inquiries
into
the
intellectual
basis
of
christianity
but
that
they
held
that
men
were
not
obliged
to
wait
for
logical
proof
before
believing
on
the
contrary
that
the
majority
were
to
believe
first
on
presumptions
and
let
the
intellectual
proof
come
as
their
reward
augustine
who
had
tried
both
ways
strikingly
contrasts
them
in
his
utilitate
though
his
direct
object
in
that
work
is
to
decide
not
between
reason
and
faith
but
between
reason
and
authority
he
addresses
in
it
a
very
dear
friend
who
like
himself
had
become
a
manichee
but
who
with
less
happiness
than
his
own
was
still
retained
in
the
heresy
the
manichees
he
observes
inveigh
against
those
who
following
the
authority
of
the
catholic
faith
fortify
themselves
in
the
first
instance
with
believing
and
before
they
are
able
to
set
eyes
upon
that
truth
which
is
discerned
by
the
pure
soul
prepare
themselves
for
a
god
who
shall
illuminate
you
honoratus
know
that
nothing
else
was
the
cause
of
my
falling
into
their
hands
than
their
professing
to
put
away
authority
which
was
so
terrible
and
by
absolute
and
simple
reason
to
lead
their
hearers
to
god
presence
and
to
rid
them
of
all
error
for
what
was
there
else
that
forced
me
for
nearly
nine
years
to
slight
the
religion
which
was
sown
in
me
when
a
child
by
my
parents
and
to
follow
them
and
diligently
attend
their
lectures
but
their
assertion
that
i
was
terrified
by
superstition
and
was
bidden
to
have
faith
before
i
had
reason
whereas
they
pressed
no
one
to
believe
before
the
truth
had
been
discussed
and
unravelled
who
would
not
be
seduced
by
these
promises
and
especially
a
youth
such
as
they
found
me
then
desirous
of
truth
nay
conceited
and
forward
by
reason
of
the
disputations
of
certain
men
of
school
learning
with
a
contempt
of
tales
and
a
desire
of
possessing
and
drinking
that
clear
and
unmixed
truth
which
they
promised
me
presently
he
goes
on
to
describe
how
he
was
reclaimed
he
found
the
manichees
more
successful
in
pulling
down
than
in
building
up
he
was
disappointed
in
faustus
whom
he
found
eloquent
and
nothing
besides
upon
this
he
did
not
know
what
to
hold
and
was
tempted
to
a
general
scepticism
at
length
he
found
he
must
be
guided
by
authority
then
came
the
question
which
authority
among
so
many
teachers
he
cried
earnestly
to
god
for
help
and
at
last
was
led
to
the
catholic
church
he
then
returns
to
the
question
urged
against
that
church
that
she
bids
those
who
come
to
her
believe
whereas
heretics
boast
that
they
do
not
impose
a
yoke
of
believing
but
open
a
fountain
of
teaching
on
which
he
observes
true
religion
can
not
in
any
manner
be
rightly
embraced
without
a
belief
in
those
things
which
each
individual
afterwards
attains
and
perceives
if
he
behave
himself
well
and
shall
deserve
it
nor
altogether
without
some
weighty
and
imperative
authority
these
are
specimens
of
the
teaching
of
the
ancient
church
on
the
subject
of
faith
and
reason
if
on
the
other
hand
we
would
know
what
has
been
taught
on
the
subject
in
those
modern
schools
in
and
through
which
the
subsequent
developments
of
catholic
doctrines
have
proceeded
we
may
turn
to
the
extracts
made
from
their
writings
by
huet
in
his
essay
on
the
human
understanding
and
in
so
doing
we
need
not
perplex
ourselves
with
the
particular
theory
true
or
not
for
the
sake
of
which
he
has
collected
them
speaking
of
the
weakness
of
the
understanding
huet
says
god
by
his
goodness
repairs
this
defect
of
human
nature
by
granting
us
the
inestimable
gift
of
faith
which
confirms
our
staggering
reason
and
corrects
that
perplexity
of
doubts
which
we
must
bring
to
the
knowledge
of
things
for
example
my
reason
not
being
able
to
inform
me
with
absolute
evidence
and
perfect
certainty
whether
there
are
bodies
what
was
the
origin
of
the
world
and
many
other
like
things
after
i
had
received
the
faith
all
those
doubts
vanish
as
darkness
at
the
rising
of
the
sun
this
made
thomas
aquinas
say
is
necessary
for
man
to
receive
as
articles
of
faith
not
only
the
things
which
are
above
reason
but
even
those
that
for
their
certainty
may
be
known
by
reason
for
human
reason
is
very
deficient
in
things
divine
a
sign
of
which
we
have
from
philosophers
who
in
the
search
of
human
things
by
natural
methods
have
been
deceived
and
opposed
each
other
on
many
heads
to
the
end
then
that
men
may
have
a
certain
and
undoubted
cognizance
of
god
it
was
necessary
things
divine
should
be
taught
them
by
way
of
faith
as
being
revealed
of
god
himself
who
can
not
lie
then
thomas
adds
afterwards
search
by
natural
reason
is
sufficient
to
make
man
know
things
divine
nor
even
those
which
we
can
prove
by
reason
and
in
another
place
he
speaks
thus
which
may
be
proved
demonstratively
as
the
being
of
god
the
unity
of
the
godhead
and
other
points
are
placed
among
articles
we
are
to
believe
because
previous
to
other
things
that
are
of
faith
and
these
must
be
presupposed
at
least
by
such
as
have
no
demonstration
of
them
what
thomas
says
of
the
cognizance
of
divine
things
extends
also
to
the
knowledge
of
human
according
to
the
doctrine
of
suarez
often
correct
he
says
light
of
nature
by
the
light
of
faith
even
in
things
which
seem
to
be
first
principles
as
appears
in
this
those
things
that
are
the
same
to
a
third
are
the
same
between
themselves
which
if
we
have
respect
to
the
trinity
ought
to
be
restrained
to
finite
things
and
in
other
mysteries
especially
in
those
of
the
incarnation
and
the
eucharist
we
use
many
other
limitations
that
nothing
may
be
repugnant
to
the
faith
this
is
then
an
indication
that
the
light
of
faith
is
most
certain
because
founded
on
the
first
truth
which
is
god
to
whom
it
more
impossible
to
deceive
or
be
deceived
than
for
the
natural
science
of
man
to
be
mistaken
and
erroneous
if
we
hearken
not
to
reason
say
you
you
overthrow
that
great
foundation
of
religion
which
reason
has
established
in
our
understanding
viz
god
is
to
answer
this
objection
you
must
be
told
that
men
know
god
in
two
manners
by
reason
with
entire
human
certainty
and
by
faith
with
absolute
and
divine
certainty
although
by
reason
we
can
not
acquire
any
knowledge
more
certain
than
that
of
the
being
of
god
insomuch
that
all
the
arguments
which
the
impious
oppose
to
this
knowledge
are
of
no
validity
and
easily
refuted
nevertheless
this
certainty
is
not
absolutely
perfect
now
although
to
prove
the
existence
of
the
deity
we
can
bring
arguments
which
accumulated
and
connected
together
are
not
of
less
power
to
convince
men
than
geometrical
principles
and
theorems
deduced
from
them
and
which
are
of
entire
human
certainty
notwithstanding
because
learned
philosophers
have
openly
opposed
even
these
principles
clear
we
can
not
neither
in
the
natural
knowledge
we
have
of
god
which
is
acquired
by
reason
nor
in
science
founded
on
geometrical
principles
and
theorems
find
absolute
and
consummate
certainty
but
only
that
human
certainty
i
have
spoken
of
to
which
nevertheless
every
wise
man
ought
to
submit
his
understanding
this
being
not
repugnant
to
the
testimony
of
the
book
of
wisdom
and
the
epistle
to
the
romans
which
declares
that
men
who
do
not
from
the
make
of
the
world
acknowledge
the
power
and
divinity
of
the
maker
are
senseless
and
inexcusable
for
to
use
the
terms
of
vasquez
these
words
the
holy
scripture
means
only
that
there
has
ever
been
a
sufficient
testimony
of
the
being
of
a
god
in
the
fabrick
of
the
world
and
in
his
other
works
to
make
him
known
unto
men
but
the
scripture
is
not
under
any
concern
whether
this
knowledge
be
evident
or
of
greatest
probability
for
these
terms
are
seen
and
understood
in
their
common
and
usual
acceptation
to
signify
all
the
knowledge
of
the
mind
with
a
determined
assent
he
adds
after
if
any
one
should
at
this
time
deny
christ
that
which
would
render
him
inexcusable
would
not
be
because
he
might
have
had
an
evident
knowledge
and
reason
for
believing
him
but
because
he
might
have
believed
it
by
faith
and
a
prudential
knowledge
is
with
reason
then
that
suarez
teaches
that
natural
evidence
of
this
principle
god
is
the
first
truth
who
can
not
be
deceived
is
not
necessary
nor
sufficient
enough
to
make
us
believe
by
infused
faith
what
god
reveals
he
proves
by
the
testimony
of
experience
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
ignorant
and
illiterate
christians
though
they
know
nothing
clearly
and
certainly
of
god
do
believe
nevertheless
that
god
is
even
christians
of
parts
and
learning
as
thomas
has
observed
believe
that
god
is
before
they
know
it
by
reason
suarez
shows
afterwards
that
the
natural
evidence
of
this
principle
is
not
sufficient
because
divine
faith
which
is
infused
into
our
understanding
can
not
be
bottomed
upon
human
faith
alone
how
clear
and
firm
soever
it
is
as
upon
a
formal
object
because
an
assent
most
firm
and
of
an
order
most
noble
and
exalted
can
not
derive
its
certainty
from
a
more
infirm
assent
as
touching
the
motives
of
credibility
which
preparing
the
mind
to
receive
faith
ought
according
to
you
to
be
not
only
certain
by
supreme
and
human
certainty
but
by
supreme
and
absolute
certainty
i
will
oppose
gabriel
biel
to
you
who
pronounces
that
to
receive
faith
is
sufficient
that
the
motives
of
credibility
be
proposed
as
probable
do
you
believe
that
children
illiterate
gross
ignorant
people
who
have
scarcely
the
use
of
reason
and
notwithstanding
have
received
the
gift
of
faith
do
most
clearly
and
most
steadfastly
conceive
those
forementioned
motives
of
credibility
no
without
doubt
but
the
grace
of
god
comes
in
to
their
assistance
and
sustains
the
imbecility
of
nature
and
reason
this
is
the
common
opinion
of
divines
reason
has
need
of
divine
grace
not
only
in
gross
illiterate
persons
but
even
in
those
of
parts
and
learning
for
how
soever
that
may
be
yet
it
can
not
make
us
have
faith
if
celestial
light
does
not
illuminate
us
within
because
as
i
have
said
already
divine
faith
being
of
a
superior
order
can
not
derive
its
efficacy
from
human
faith
this
is
likewise
the
doctrine
of
thomas
aquinas
light
of
faith
makes
things
seen
that
are
believed
he
says
moreover
have
knowledge
of
the
things
of
faith
not
in
a
demonstrative
way
but
so
as
by
the
light
of
faith
it
appears
to
them
that
they
ought
to
be
believed
it
is
evident
what
a
special
influence
such
doctrine
as
this
must
exert
upon
the
theological
method
of
those
who
hold
it
arguments
will
come
to
be
considered
as
suggestions
and
guides
rather
than
logical
proofs
and
developments
as
the
slow
spontaneous
ethical
growth
not
the
scientific
and
compulsory
results
of
existing
opinions
i
have
spoken
and
have
still
to
speak
of
the
action
of
logic
implicit
and
explicit
as
a
safeguard
and
thereby
a
note
of
legitimate
developments
of
doctrine
but
i
am
regarding
it
here
as
that
continuous
tradition
and
habit
in
the
church
of
a
scientific
analysis
of
all
revealed
truth
which
is
an
ecclesiastical
principle
rather
than
a
note
of
any
kind
as
not
merely
bearing
upon
the
process
of
development
but
applying
to
all
religious
teaching
equally
and
which
is
almost
unknown
beyond
the
pale
of
christendom
reason
thus
considered
is
subservient
to
faith
as
handling
examining
explaining
recording
cataloguing
defending
the
truths
which
faith
not
reason
has
gained
for
us
as
providing
an
intellectual
expression
of
supernatural
facts
eliciting
what
is
implicit
comparing
measuring
connecting
each
with
each
and
forming
one
and
all
into
a
theological
system
the
first
step
in
theology
is
investigation
an
investigation
arising
out
of
the
lively
interest
and
devout
welcome
which
the
matters
investigated
claim
of
us
and
if
scripture
teaches
us
the
duty
of
faith
it
teaches
quite
as
distinctly
that
loving
inquisitiveness
which
is
the
life
of
the
it
attributes
that
temper
both
to
the
blessed
virgin
and
to
the
angels
the
angels
are
said
to
have
desired
to
look
into
the
mysteries
of
revelation
and
it
is
twice
recorded
of
mary
that
she
kept
these
things
and
pondered
them
in
her
heart
moreover
her
words
to
the
archangel
how
shall
this
be
show
that
there
is
a
questioning
in
matters
revealed
to
us
compatible
with
the
fullest
and
most
absolute
faith
it
has
sometimes
been
said
in
defence
and
commendation
of
heretics
that
their
misbelief
at
least
showed
that
they
had
thought
upon
the
subject
of
religion
this
is
an
unseemly
paradox
at
the
same
time
there
certainly
is
the
opposite
extreme
of
a
readiness
to
receive
any
number
of
dogmas
at
a
minute
warning
which
when
it
is
witnessed
fairly
creates
a
suspicion
that
they
are
merely
professed
with
the
tongue
not
intelligently
held
our
lord
gives
no
countenance
to
such
lightness
of
mind
he
calls
on
his
disciples
to
use
their
reason
and
to
submit
it
nathanael
question
can
there
any
good
thing
come
out
of
nazareth
did
not
prevent
our
lord
praise
of
him
as
an
israelite
without
guile
nor
did
he
blame
nicodemus
except
for
want
of
theological
knowledge
on
his
asking
how
can
these
things
be
even
towards
thomas
he
was
gentle
as
if
towards
one
of
those
who
had
eyes
too
tremblingly
awake
to
bear
with
dimness
for
his
sake
in
like
manner
he
praised
the
centurion
when
he
argued
himself
into
a
confidence
of
divine
help
and
relief
from
the
analogy
of
his
own
profession
and
left
his
captious
enemies
to
prove
for
themselves
from
the
mission
of
the
baptist
his
own
mission
and
asked
them
if
david
called
him
lord
how
was
he
his
son
and
when
his
disciples
wished
to
have
a
particular
matter
taught
them
chid
them
for
their
want
of
understanding
and
these
are
but
some
out
of
the
various
instances
which
he
gives
us
of
the
same
lesson
reason
has
ever
been
awake
and
in
exercise
in
the
church
after
him
from
the
first
scarcely
were
the
apostles
withdrawn
from
the
world
when
the
martyr
ignatius
in
his
way
to
the
roman
amphitheatre
wrote
his
strikingly
theological
epistles
he
was
followed
by
iren√¶us
hippolytus
and
tertullian
thus
we
are
brought
to
the
age
of
athanasius
and
his
contemporaries
and
to
augustine
then
we
pass
on
by
maximus
and
john
damascene
to
the
middle
age
when
theology
was
made
still
more
scientific
by
the
schoolmen
nor
has
it
become
less
so
by
passing
on
from
thomas
to
the
great
jesuit
writers
suarez
and
vasquez
and
then
to
lambertini
and
its
mystical
several
passages
have
occurred
in
the
foregoing
chapters
which
serve
to
suggest
another
principle
on
which
some
words
are
now
to
be
said
theodore
exclusive
adoption
of
the
literal
and
repudiation
of
the
mystical
interpretation
of
holy
scripture
leads
to
the
consideration
of
the
latter
as
one
of
the
characteristic
conditions
or
principles
on
which
the
teaching
of
the
church
has
ever
proceeded
thus
christianity
developed
as
we
have
incidentally
seen
into
the
form
first
of
a
catholic
then
of
a
papal
church
now
it
was
scripture
that
was
made
the
rule
on
which
this
development
proceeded
in
each
case
and
scripture
moreover
interpreted
in
a
mystical
sense
and
whereas
at
first
certain
texts
were
inconsistently
confined
to
the
letter
and
a
millennium
was
in
consequence
expected
the
very
course
of
events
as
time
went
on
interpreted
the
prophecies
about
the
church
more
truly
and
that
first
in
respect
of
her
prerogative
as
occupying
the
next
in
support
of
the
claims
of
the
see
of
peter
this
is
but
one
specimen
of
a
certain
law
of
christian
teaching
which
is
this
a
reference
to
scripture
throughout
and
especially
in
its
mystical
sense
this
is
a
characteristic
which
will
become
more
and
more
evident
to
us
the
more
we
look
for
it
the
divines
of
the
church
are
in
every
age
engaged
in
regulating
themselves
by
scripture
appealing
to
scripture
in
proof
of
their
conclusions
and
exhorting
and
teaching
in
the
thoughts
and
language
of
scripture
scripture
may
be
said
to
be
the
medium
in
which
the
mind
of
the
church
has
energized
and
developed
when
methodius
would
enforce
the
doctrine
of
vows
of
celibacy
he
refers
to
the
book
of
numbers
and
if
iren√¶us
proclaims
the
dignity
of
mary
it
is
from
a
comparison
of
luke
gospel
with
genesis
and
thus
cyprian
in
his
testimonies
rests
the
prerogatives
of
martyrdom
as
indeed
the
whole
circle
of
christian
doctrine
on
the
declaration
of
certain
texts
and
when
in
his
letter
to
antonian
he
seems
to
allude
to
purgatory
he
refers
to
our
lord
words
about
the
prison
and
paying
the
last
farthing
and
if
ignatius
exhorts
to
unity
it
is
from
paul
and
he
quotes
luke
against
the
phantasiasts
of
his
day
we
have
a
first
instance
of
this
law
in
the
epistle
of
polycarp
and
a
last
in
the
practical
works
of
alphonso
liguori
cyprian
or
ambrose
or
bede
or
bernard
or
carlo
or
such
popular
books
as
horstius
are
specimens
of
a
rule
which
is
too
obvious
to
need
formal
proof
it
is
exemplified
in
the
theological
decisions
of
athanasius
in
the
fourth
century
and
of
thomas
in
the
thirteenth
in
the
structure
of
the
canon
law
and
in
the
bulls
and
letters
of
popes
it
is
instanced
in
the
notion
so
long
prevalent
in
the
church
which
philosophers
of
this
day
do
not
allow
us
to
forget
that
all
truth
all
science
must
be
derived
from
the
inspired
volume
and
it
is
recognized
as
well
as
exemplified
recognized
as
distinctly
by
writers
of
the
society
of
jesus
as
it
is
copiously
exemplified
by
the
fathers
scriptures
are
called
canonical
says
salmeron
as
having
been
received
and
set
apart
by
the
church
into
the
canon
of
sacred
books
and
because
they
are
to
us
a
rule
of
right
belief
and
good
living
also
because
they
ought
to
rule
and
moderate
all
other
doctrines
laws
writings
whether
ecclesiastical
apocryphal
or
human
for
as
these
agree
with
them
or
at
least
do
not
disagree
so
far
are
they
admitted
but
they
are
repudiated
and
reprobated
so
far
as
they
differ
from
them
even
in
the
least
matter
again
the
main
subject
of
scripture
is
nothing
else
than
to
treat
of
the
or
the
christ
jesus
not
only
in
the
new
testament
which
is
open
but
in
the
old
for
whereas
scripture
contains
nothing
but
the
precepts
of
belief
and
conduct
or
faith
and
works
the
end
and
the
means
towards
it
the
creator
and
the
creature
love
of
god
and
our
neighbour
creation
and
redemption
and
whereas
all
these
are
found
in
christ
it
follows
that
christ
is
the
proper
subject
of
canonical
scripture
for
all
matters
of
faith
whether
concerning
creator
or
creatures
are
recapitulated
in
jesus
whom
every
heresy
denies
according
to
that
text
spirit
that
divides
jesus
is
not
of
god
for
he
as
man
is
united
to
the
godhead
and
as
god
to
the
manhood
to
the
father
from
whom
he
is
born
to
the
holy
ghost
who
proceeds
at
once
from
christ
and
the
father
to
mary
his
most
holy
mother
to
the
church
to
scriptures
sacraments
saints
angels
the
blessed
to
divine
grace
to
the
authority
and
ministers
of
the
church
so
that
it
is
rightly
said
that
every
heresy
divides
jesus
and
again
holy
scripture
is
so
fashioned
and
composed
by
the
holy
ghost
as
to
be
accommodated
to
all
plans
times
persons
difficulties
dangers
diseases
the
expulsion
of
evil
the
obtaining
of
good
the
stifling
of
errors
the
establishment
of
doctrines
the
ingrafting
of
virtues
the
averting
of
vices
hence
it
is
deservedly
compared
by
st
basil
to
a
dispensary
which
supplies
various
medicines
against
every
complaint
from
it
did
the
church
in
the
age
of
martyrs
draw
her
firmness
and
fortitude
in
the
age
of
doctors
her
wisdom
and
light
of
knowledge
in
the
time
of
heretics
the
overthrow
of
error
in
time
of
prosperity
humility
and
moderation
fervour
and
diligence
in
a
lukewarm
time
and
in
times
of
depravity
and
growing
abuse
reformation
from
corrupt
living
and
return
to
the
first
estate
holy
scripture
says
cornelius
√†
lapide
contains
the
beginnings
of
all
theology
for
theology
is
nothing
but
the
science
of
conclusions
which
are
drawn
from
principles
certain
to
faith
and
therefore
is
of
all
sciences
most
august
as
well
as
certain
but
the
principles
of
faith
and
faith
itself
doth
scripture
contain
whence
it
evidently
follows
that
holy
scripture
lays
down
those
principles
of
theology
by
which
the
theologian
begets
of
the
mind
reasoning
his
demonstrations
he
then
who
thinks
he
can
tear
away
scholastic
science
from
the
work
of
commenting
on
holy
scripture
is
hoping
for
offspring
without
a
mother
again
what
is
the
of
scripture
must
i
say
it
in
a
word
its
aim
is
omni
it
embraces
in
its
bosom
all
studies
all
that
can
be
known
and
thus
it
is
a
certain
university
of
sciences
containing
all
sciences
either
or
nor
am
i
aware
that
later
writers
deny
that
the
whole
catholic
faith
may
be
proved
from
scripture
though
they
would
certainly
maintain
that
it
is
not
to
be
found
on
the
surface
of
it
nor
in
such
sense
that
it
may
be
gained
from
scripture
without
the
aid
of
tradition
and
this
has
been
the
doctrine
of
all
ages
of
the
church
as
is
shown
by
the
disinclination
of
her
teachers
to
confine
themselves
to
the
mere
literal
interpretation
of
scripture
her
most
subtle
and
powerful
method
of
proof
whether
in
ancient
or
modern
times
is
the
mystical
sense
which
is
so
frequently
used
in
doctrinal
controversy
as
on
many
occasions
to
supersede
any
other
thus
the
council
of
trent
appeals
to
the
spoken
of
in
malachi
in
proof
of
the
eucharistic
sacrifice
to
the
water
and
blood
issuing
from
our
lord
side
and
to
the
mention
of
waters
in
the
apocalypse
in
admonishing
on
the
subject
of
the
mixture
of
water
with
the
wine
in
the
oblation
thus
bellarmine
defends
monastic
celibacy
by
our
lord
words
in
matthew
and
refers
to
we
went
through
fire
and
water
in
the
psalm
as
an
argument
for
purgatory
and
these
as
is
plain
are
but
specimens
of
a
rule
now
on
turning
to
primitive
controversy
we
find
this
method
of
interpretation
to
be
the
very
basis
of
the
proof
of
the
catholic
doctrine
of
the
holy
trinity
whether
we
betake
ourselves
to
the
writers
or
the
nicene
certain
texts
will
meet
us
which
do
not
obviously
refer
to
that
doctrine
yet
are
put
forward
as
palmary
proofs
of
it
such
are
in
respect
of
our
lord
divinity
my
heart
is
inditing
of
a
good
matter
or
has
burst
forth
with
a
good
word
the
lord
made
or
possessed
me
in
the
beginning
of
his
ways
i
was
with
him
in
whom
he
delighted
in
thy
light
shall
we
see
light
who
shall
declare
his
generation
she
is
the
breath
of
the
power
of
god
and
his
eternal
power
and
godhead
on
the
other
hand
the
school
of
antioch
which
adopted
the
literal
interpretation
was
as
i
have
noticed
above
the
very
metropolis
of
heresy
not
to
speak
of
lucian
whose
history
is
but
imperfectly
known
one
of
the
first
masters
of
this
school
and
also
teacher
of
arius
and
his
principal
supporters
diodorus
and
theodore
of
mopsuestia
who
were
the
most
eminent
masters
of
literalism
in
the
succeeding
generation
were
as
we
have
seen
the
forerunners
of
nestorianism
the
case
had
been
the
same
in
a
still
earlier
age
the
jews
clung
to
the
literal
sense
of
the
scriptures
and
hence
rejected
the
gospel
the
christian
apologists
proved
its
divinity
by
means
of
the
allegorical
the
formal
connexion
of
this
mode
of
interpretation
with
christian
theology
is
noticed
by
porphyry
who
speaks
of
origen
and
others
as
borrowing
it
from
heathen
philosophy
both
in
explanation
of
the
old
testament
and
in
defence
of
their
own
doctrine
it
may
be
almost
laid
down
as
an
historical
fact
that
the
mystical
interpretation
and
orthodoxy
will
stand
or
fall
together
this
is
clearly
seen
as
regards
the
primitive
theology
by
a
recent
writer
in
the
course
of
a
dissertation
upon
ephrem
after
observing
that
theodore
of
heraclea
eusebius
and
diodorus
gave
a
systematic
opposition
to
the
mystical
interpretation
which
had
a
sort
of
sanction
from
antiquity
and
the
orthodox
church
he
proceeds
ephrem
is
not
as
sober
in
his
interpretations
could
it
be
he
was
a
zealous
disciple
of
the
orthodox
faith
for
all
those
who
are
most
eminent
in
such
sobriety
were
as
far
as
possible
removed
from
the
faith
of
the
councils
on
the
other
hand
all
who
retained
the
faith
of
the
church
never
entirely
dispensed
with
the
spiritual
sense
of
the
scriptures
for
the
councils
watched
over
the
orthodox
faith
nor
was
it
safe
in
those
ages
as
we
learn
especially
from
the
instance
of
theodore
of
mopsuestia
to
desert
the
spiritual
for
an
exclusive
cultivation
of
the
literal
method
moreover
the
allegorical
interpretation
even
when
the
literal
sense
was
not
injured
was
also
preserved
because
in
those
times
when
both
heretics
and
jews
in
controversy
were
stubborn
in
their
objections
to
christian
doctrine
maintaining
that
the
messiah
was
yet
to
come
or
denying
the
abrogation
of
the
sabbath
and
ceremonial
law
or
ridiculing
the
christian
doctrine
of
the
trinity
and
especially
that
of
christ
divine
nature
under
such
circumstances
ecclesiastical
writers
found
it
to
their
purpose
in
answer
to
such
exceptions
violently
to
refer
every
part
of
scripture
by
allegory
to
christ
and
his
church
with
this
passage
from
a
learned
german
illustrating
the
bearing
of
the
allegorical
method
upon
the
judaic
and
athanasian
controversies
it
will
be
well
to
compare
the
following
passage
from
the
latitudinarian
golden
remains
as
directed
against
the
theology
of
rome
the
literal
plain
and
uncontroversible
meaning
of
scripture
he
says
without
any
addition
or
supply
by
way
of
interpretation
is
that
alone
which
for
ground
of
faith
we
are
necessarily
bound
to
accept
except
it
be
there
where
the
holy
ghost
himself
treads
us
out
another
way
i
take
not
this
to
be
any
particular
conceit
of
mine
but
that
unto
which
our
church
stands
necessarily
bound
when
we
receded
from
the
church
of
rome
one
motive
was
because
she
added
unto
scripture
her
glosses
as
canonical
to
supply
what
the
plain
text
of
scripture
could
not
yield
if
in
place
of
hers
we
set
up
our
own
glosses
thus
to
do
were
nothing
else
but
to
pull
down
baal
and
set
up
an
ephod
to
run
round
and
meet
the
church
of
rome
again
in
the
same
point
in
which
at
first
we
left
her
this
doctrine
of
the
literal
sense
was
never
grievous
or
prejudicial
to
any
but
only
to
those
who
were
inwardly
conscious
that
their
positions
were
not
sufficiently
grounded
when
cardinal
cajetan
in
the
days
of
our
grandfathers
had
forsaken
that
vein
of
postilling
and
allegorizing
on
scripture
which
for
a
long
time
had
prevailed
in
the
church
and
betaken
himself
unto
the
literal
sense
it
was
a
thing
so
distasteful
unto
the
church
of
rome
that
he
was
forced
to
find
out
many
shifts
and
make
many
apologies
for
himself
the
truth
is
as
it
will
appear
to
him
that
reads
his
writings
this
sticking
close
to
the
literal
sense
was
that
alone
which
made
him
to
shake
off
many
of
those
tenets
upon
which
the
church
of
rome
and
the
reformed
churches
differ
but
when
the
importunity
of
the
reformers
and
the
great
credit
of
calvin
writings
in
that
kind
had
forced
the
divines
of
rome
to
level
their
interpretations
by
the
same
line
when
they
saw
that
no
pains
no
subtlety
of
wit
was
strong
enough
to
defeat
the
literal
evidence
of
scripture
it
drove
them
on
those
desperate
shoals
on
which
at
this
day
they
stick
to
call
in
question
as
far
as
they
durst
the
credit
of
the
hebrew
text
and
countenance
against
it
a
corrupt
translation
to
add
traditions
unto
scripture
and
to
make
the
church
interpretation
so
pretended
to
be
above
exception
he
presently
adds
concerning
the
allegorical
sense
if
we
absolutely
condemn
these
interpretations
then
must
we
condemn
a
great
part
of
antiquity
who
are
very
much
conversant
in
this
kind
of
interpreting
for
the
most
partial
for
antiquity
can
not
choose
but
see
and
confess
thus
much
that
for
the
literal
sense
the
interpreters
of
our
own
times
because
of
their
skill
in
the
original
languages
their
care
of
pressing
the
circumstances
and
coherence
of
the
text
of
comparing
like
places
of
scripture
with
like
have
generally
surpassed
the
best
of
the
ancients
the
use
of
scripture
then
especially
its
spiritual
or
second
sense
as
a
medium
of
thought
and
deduction
is
a
characteristic
principle
of
doctrinal
teaching
in
the
church
that
opinions
in
religion
are
not
matters
of
indifference
but
have
a
definite
bearing
on
the
position
of
their
holders
in
the
divine
sight
is
a
principle
on
which
the
evangelical
faith
has
from
the
first
developed
and
on
which
that
faith
has
been
the
first
to
develope
i
suppose
it
hardly
had
any
exercise
under
the
law
the
zeal
and
obedience
of
the
ancient
people
being
mainly
employed
in
the
maintenance
of
divine
worship
and
the
overthrow
of
idolatry
not
in
the
action
of
the
intellect
faith
is
in
this
as
in
other
respects
a
characteristic
of
the
gospel
except
so
far
as
it
was
anticipated
as
its
time
drew
near
elijah
and
the
prophets
down
to
ezra
resisted
baal
or
restored
the
temple
service
the
three
children
refused
to
bow
down
before
the
golden
image
daniel
would
turn
his
face
towards
jerusalem
the
maccabees
spurned
the
grecian
paganism
on
the
other
hand
the
greek
philosophers
were
authoritative
indeed
in
their
teaching
enforced
the
and
demanded
the
faith
of
their
disciples
but
they
did
not
commonly
attach
sanctity
or
reality
to
opinions
or
view
them
in
a
religious
light
our
saviour
was
the
first
to
bear
witness
to
the
truth
and
to
die
for
it
when
before
pontius
pilate
he
witnessed
a
good
confession
john
and
paul
following
his
example
both
pronounce
anathema
on
those
who
denied
the
truth
or
brought
in
another
gospel
tradition
tells
us
that
the
apostle
of
love
seconded
his
word
with
his
deed
and
on
one
occasion
hastily
quitted
a
bath
because
an
heresiarch
of
the
day
had
entered
it
ignatius
his
contemporary
compares
false
teachers
to
raging
dogs
and
polycarp
his
disciple
exercised
the
same
seventy
upon
marcion
which
john
had
shown
towards
cerinthus
iren√¶us
after
polycarp
exemplifies
the
same
doctrine
i
saw
thee
he
says
to
the
heretic
florinus
when
i
was
yet
a
boy
in
lower
asia
with
polycarp
when
thou
wast
living
splendidly
in
the
imperial
court
and
trying
to
recommend
thyself
to
him
i
remember
indeed
what
then
happened
better
than
more
recent
occurrences
for
the
lessons
of
boyhood
grow
with
the
mind
and
become
one
with
it
thus
i
can
name
the
place
where
blessed
polycarp
sat
and
conversed
and
his
goings
out
and
comings
in
and
the
fashion
of
his
life
and
the
appearance
of
his
person
and
his
discourses
to
the
people
and
his
familiarity
with
john
which
he
used
to
tell
of
and
with
the
rest
who
had
seen
the
lord
and
how
he
used
to
repeat
their
words
and
what
it
was
that
he
had
learned
about
the
lord
from
them
and
in
the
sight
of
god
i
can
protest
that
if
that
blessed
and
apostolical
elder
had
heard
aught
of
this
doctrine
he
had
cried
out
and
stopped
his
ears
saying
after
his
wont
good
god
for
what
times
hast
thou
reserved
me
that
i
should
endure
this
and
he
had
fled
the
place
where
he
was
sitting
or
standing
when
he
heard
it
it
seems
to
have
been
the
duty
of
every
individual
christian
from
the
first
to
witness
in
his
place
against
all
opinions
which
were
contrary
to
what
he
had
received
in
his
baptismal
catechizing
and
to
shun
the
society
of
those
who
maintained
them
so
religious
says
iren√¶us
after
giving
his
account
of
polycarp
were
the
apostles
and
their
disciples
in
not
even
conversing
with
those
who
counterfeited
the
truth
such
a
principle
however
would
but
have
broken
up
the
church
the
sooner
resolving
it
into
the
individuals
of
which
it
was
composed
unless
the
truth
to
which
they
were
to
bear
witness
had
been
a
something
definite
and
formal
and
independent
of
themselves
christians
were
bound
to
defend
and
to
transmit
the
faith
which
they
had
received
and
they
received
it
from
the
rulers
of
the
church
and
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
duty
of
those
rulers
to
watch
over
and
define
this
traditionary
faith
it
is
unnecessary
to
go
over
ground
which
has
been
traversed
so
often
of
late
years
iren√¶us
brings
the
subject
before
us
in
his
description
of
polycarp
part
of
which
has
already
been
quoted
and
to
it
we
may
limit
ourselves
polycarp
he
says
when
writing
against
the
gnostics
whom
we
have
seen
in
our
first
youth
ever
taught
those
lessons
which
he
learned
from
the
apostles
which
the
church
also
transmits
which
alone
are
true
all
the
churches
of
asia
bear
witness
to
them
and
the
successors
of
polycarp
down
to
this
day
who
is
a
much
more
trustworthy
and
sure
witness
of
truth
than
valentinus
marcion
or
their
perverse
companions
the
same
was
in
rome
in
the
time
of
anicetus
and
converted
many
of
the
aforenamed
heretics
to
the
church
of
god
preaching
that
he
had
received
from
the
apostles
this
one
and
only
truth
which
had
been
transmitted
by
the
church
nor
was
this
the
doctrine
and
practice
of
one
school
only
which
might
be
ignorant
of
philosophy
the
cultivated
minds
of
the
alexandrian
fathers
who
are
said
to
owe
so
much
to
pagan
science
certainly
showed
no
gratitude
or
reverence
towards
their
alleged
instructors
but
maintained
the
supremacy
of
catholic
tradition
clement
speaks
of
heretical
teachers
as
perverting
scripture
and
essaying
the
gate
of
heaven
with
a
false
key
not
raising
the
veil
as
he
and
his
by
means
of
tradition
from
christ
but
digging
through
the
church
wall
and
becoming
mystagogues
of
misbelief
for
he
continues
few
words
are
enough
to
prove
that
they
have
formed
their
human
assemblies
later
than
the
catholic
church
and
from
that
previously
existing
and
most
true
church
it
is
very
clear
that
these
later
heresies
and
others
which
have
been
since
are
counterfeit
and
novel
inventions
when
the
marcionites
valentinians
and
the
like
says
origen
appeal
to
apocryphal
works
they
are
saying
is
in
the
desert
when
to
canonical
scripture
he
is
in
the
chambers
but
we
must
not
depart
from
that
first
and
ecclesiastical
tradition
nor
believe
otherwise
than
as
the
churches
of
god
by
succession
have
transmitted
to
us
and
it
is
recorded
of
him
in
his
youth
that
he
never
could
be
brought
to
attend
the
prayers
of
a
heretic
who
was
in
the
house
of
his
patroness
from
abomination
of
his
doctrine
observing
adds
eusebius
the
rule
of
the
church
eusebius
too
himself
unsatisfactory
as
is
his
own
theology
can
not
break
from
this
fundamental
rule
he
ever
speaks
of
the
gnostic
teachers
the
chief
heretics
of
his
period
at
least
before
the
rise
of
arianism
in
terms
most
expressive
of
abhorrence
and
disgust
the
african
syrian
and
asian
schools
are
additional
witnesses
tertullian
at
carthage
was
strenuous
for
the
dogmatic
principle
even
after
he
had
given
up
the
traditional
the
fathers
of
asia
minor
who
excommunicated
no√´tus
rehearse
the
creed
and
add
we
declare
as
we
have
learned
the
fathers
of
antioch
who
depose
paul
of
samosata
set
down
in
writing
the
creed
from
scripture
which
they
say
we
received
from
the
beginning
and
have
by
tradition
and
in
custody
in
the
catholic
and
holy
church
until
this
day
by
succession
as
preached
by
the
blessed
apostles
who
were
and
ministers
of
the
word
moreover
it
is
as
plain
or
even
plainer
that
what
the
christians
of
the
first
ages
anathematized
included
deductions
from
the
articles
of
faith
that
is
false
developments
as
well
as
contradictions
of
those
articles
and
since
the
reason
they
commonly
gave
for
using
the
anathema
was
that
the
doctrine
in
question
was
strange
and
startling
it
follows
that
the
truth
which
was
its
contradictory
was
also
in
some
respect
unknown
to
them
hitherto
which
is
also
shown
by
their
temporary
perplexity
and
their
difficulty
of
meeting
heresy
in
particular
cases
who
ever
heard
the
like
hitherto
says
athanasius
of
apollinarianism
who
was
the
teacher
of
it
who
the
hearer
sion
shall
go
forth
the
law
of
god
and
the
word
of
the
lord
from
jerusalem
but
from
whence
hath
this
gone
forth
what
hell
hath
burst
out
with
it
the
fathers
at
nic√¶a
stopped
their
ears
and
iren√¶us
as
above
quoted
says
that
polycarp
had
he
heard
the
gnostic
blasphemies
would
have
stopped
his
ears
and
deplored
the
times
for
which
he
was
reserved
they
anathematized
the
doctrine
not
because
it
was
old
but
because
it
was
new
the
anathema
would
have
altogether
slept
if
it
could
not
have
been
extended
to
propositions
not
anathematized
in
the
beginning
for
the
very
characteristic
of
heresy
is
this
novelty
and
originality
of
manifestation
such
was
the
exclusiveness
of
christianity
of
old
i
need
not
insist
on
the
steadiness
with
which
that
principle
has
been
maintained
ever
since
for
bigotry
and
intolerance
is
one
of
the
ordinary
charges
brought
at
this
day
against
both
the
medieval
church
and
the
modern
the
church
consistency
and
thoroughness
in
teaching
is
another
aspect
of
the
same
principle
as
is
illustrated
in
the
following
passage
from
guizot
history
of
civilization
the
adversaries
he
says
of
the
reformation
knew
very
well
what
they
were
about
and
what
they
required
they
could
point
to
their
first
principles
and
boldly
admit
all
the
consequences
that
might
result
from
them
no
government
was
ever
more
consistent
and
systematic
than
that
of
the
romish
church
in
fact
the
court
of
rome
was
much
more
accommodating
yielded
much
more
than
the
reformers
but
in
principle
it
much
more
completely
adopted
its
own
system
and
maintained
a
much
more
consistent
conduct
there
is
an
immense
power
in
this
full
confidence
of
what
is
done
this
perfect
knowledge
of
what
is
required
this
complete
and
rational
adaptation
of
a
system
and
a
creed
then
he
goes
on
to
the
history
of
the
society
of
jesus
in
illustration
everything
he
says
was
unfavourable
to
the
jesuits
both
fortune
and
appearances
neither
practical
sense
which
requires
success
nor
the
imagination
which
looks
for
splendour
were
gratified
by
their
destiny
still
it
is
certain
that
they
possessed
the
elements
of
greatness
a
grand
idea
is
attached
to
their
name
to
their
influence
and
to
their
history
why
because
they
worked
from
fixed
principles
which
they
fully
and
clearly
understood
and
the
tendency
of
which
they
entirely
comprehended
in
the
reformation
on
the
contrary
when
the
event
surpassed
its
conception
something
incomplete
inconsequent
and
narrow
has
remained
which
has
placed
the
conquerors
themselves
in
a
state
of
rational
and
philosophical
inferiority
the
influence
of
which
has
occasionally
been
felt
in
events
the
conflict
of
the
new
spiritual
order
of
things
against
the
old
is
i
think
the
weak
side
of
the
reformation
such
are
some
of
the
intellectual
principles
which
are
characteristic
of
christianity
i
observe
that
their
continuity
down
to
this
day
and
the
vigour
of
their
operation
are
two
distinct
guarantees
that
the
theological
conclusions
to
which
they
are
subservient
are
in
accordance
with
the
divine
promise
true
developments
and
not
corruptions
of
the
revelation
moreover
if
it
be
true
that
the
principles
of
the
later
church
are
the
same
as
those
of
the
earlier
then
whatever
are
the
variations
of
belief
between
the
two
periods
the
later
in
reality
agrees
more
than
it
differs
with
the
earlier
for
principles
are
responsible
for
doctrines
hence
they
who
assert
that
the
modern
roman
system
is
the
corruption
of
primitive
theology
are
forced
to
discover
some
difference
of
principle
between
the
one
and
the
other
for
instance
that
the
right
of
private
judgment
was
secured
to
the
early
church
and
has
been
lost
to
the
later
or
again
that
the
later
church
rationalizes
and
the
earlier
went
by
faith
on
this
point
i
will
but
remark
as
follows
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
horror
of
heresy
the
law
of
absolute
obedience
to
ecclesiastical
authority
and
the
doctrine
of
the
mystical
virtue
of
unity
were
as
strong
and
active
in
the
church
of
ignatius
and
cyprian
as
in
that
of
carlo
and
pius
the
fifth
whatever
be
thought
of
the
theology
respectively
taught
in
the
one
and
in
the
other
now
we
have
before
our
eyes
the
effect
of
these
principles
in
the
instance
of
the
later
church
they
have
entirely
succeeded
in
preventing
departure
from
the
doctrine
of
trent
for
three
hundred
years
have
we
any
reason
for
doubting
that
from
the
same
strictness
the
same
fidelity
would
follow
in
the
first
three
or
any
three
centuries
of
the
period
where
then
was
the
opportunity
of
corruption
in
the
three
hundred
years
between
ignatius
and
augustine
or
between
augustine
and
bede
or
between
bede
and
peter
damiani
or
again
between
iren√¶us
and
leo
cyprian
and
gregory
the
great
athanasius
and
john
damascene
thus
the
tradition
of
eighteen
centuries
becomes
a
collection
of
indefinitely
many
each
commencing
from
its
own
point
and
each
crossing
the
other
and
each
year
as
it
comes
is
guaranteed
with
various
degrees
of
cogency
by
every
year
which
has
gone
before
it
moreover
while
the
development
of
doctrine
in
the
church
has
been
in
accordance
with
or
in
consequence
of
these
immemorial
principles
the
various
heresies
which
have
from
time
to
time
arisen
have
in
one
respect
or
other
as
might
be
expected
violated
those
principles
with
which
she
rose
into
existence
and
which
she
still
retains
thus
arian
and
nestorian
schools
denied
the
allegorical
rule
of
scripture
interpretation
the
gnostics
and
eunomians
for
faith
professed
to
substitute
knowledge
and
the
manichees
also
as
augustine
so
touchingly
declares
in
the
beginning
of
his
work
utilitate
the
dogmatic
rule
at
least
so
far
as
regards
its
traditional
character
was
thrown
aside
by
all
those
sects
which
as
tertullian
tells
us
claimed
to
judge
for
themselves
from
scripture
and
the
sacramental
principle
was
violated
by
all
who
separated
from
the
church
was
denied
also
by
faustus
the
manichee
when
he
argued
against
the
catholic
ceremonial
by
vigilantius
in
his
opposition
to
relics
and
by
the
iconoclasts
in
like
manner
the
contempt
of
mystery
of
reverence
of
devoutness
of
sanctity
are
other
notes
of
the
heretical
spirit
as
to
protestantism
it
is
plain
in
how
many
ways
it
has
reversed
the
principles
of
catholic
theology
footnotes
development
itself
is
such
a
principle
also
and
thus
i
was
led
on
to
a
further
consideration
i
saw
that
the
principle
of
development
not
only
accounted
for
certain
facts
but
was
in
itself
a
remarkable
philosophical
phenomenon
giving
a
character
to
the
whole
course
of
christian
thought
it
was
discernible
from
the
first
years
of
catholic
teaching
up
to
the
present
day
and
gave
to
that
teaching
a
unity
and
individuality
it
served
as
a
sort
of
test
which

not

name
was
it
simply
infected
by
them
in
a
word
were
its
developments
faithful
or
corrupt
nor
is
this
a
question
merely
of
the
early
centuries
when
we
consider
the
deep
interest
of
the
controversies
which
christianity
raises
the
various
characters
of
mind
it
has
swayed
the
range
of
subjects
which
it
embraces
the
many
countries
it
has
entered
the
deep
philosophies
it
has
encountered
the
vicissitudes
it
has
undergone
and
the
length
of
time
through
which
it
has
lasted
it
requires
some
assignable
explanation
why
we
should
not
consider
it
substantially
modified
and
changed
that
is
corrupted
from
the
first
by
the
numberless
influences
to
which
it
has
been
exposed
now
there
was
this
cardinal
distinction
between
christianity
and
the
religions
and
philosophies
by
which
it
was
surrounded
nay
even
the
judaism
of
the
day
that
it
referred
all
truth
and
revelation
to
one
source
and
that
the
supreme
and
only
god
pagan
rites
which
honoured
one
or
other
out
of
ten
thousand
deities
philosophies
which
scarcely
taught
any
source
of
revelation
at
all
gnostic
heresies
which
were
based
on
dualism
adored
angels
or
ascribed
the
two
testaments
to
distinct
authors
could
not
regard
truth
as
one
unalterable
consistent
imperative
and
saving
but
christianity
started
with
the
principle
that
there
was
but
one
god
and
one
mediator
and
that
he
who
at
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
spake
in
time
past
unto
the
fathers
by
the
prophets
had
in
these
last
days
spoken
unto
us
by
his
son
he
had
never
left
himself
without
witness
and
now
he
had
come
not
to
undo
the
past
but
to
fulfil
and
perfect
it
his
apostles
and
they
alone
possessed
venerated
and
protected
a
divine
message
as
both
sacred
and
sanctifying
and
in
the
collision
and
conflict
of
opinions
in
ancient
times
or
modern
it
was
that
message
and
not
any
vague
or
antagonist
teaching
that
was
to
succeed
in
purifying
assimilating
transmuting
and
taking
into
itself
the
beliefs
forms
of
worship
codes
of
duty
schools
of
thought
through
which
it
was
ever
moving
it
was
grace
and
it
was
truth
assimilating
power
of
dogmatic
that
there
is
a
truth
then
that
there
is
one
truth
that
religious
error
is
in
itself
of
an
immoral
nature
that
its
maintainers
unless
involuntarily
such
are
guilty
in
maintaining
it
that
it
is
to
be
dreaded
that
the
search
for
truth
is
not
the
gratification
of
curiosity
that
its
attainment
has
nothing
of
the
excitement
of
a
discovery
that
the
mind
is
below
truth
not
above
it
and
is
bound
not
to
descant
upon
it
but
to
venerate
it
that
truth
and
falsehood
are
set
before
us
for
the
trial
of
our
hearts
that
our
choice
is
an
awful
giving
forth
of
lots
on
which
salvation
or
rejection
is
inscribed
that
before
all
things
it
is
necessary
to
hold
the
catholic
faith
that
he
that
would
be
saved
must
thus
think
and
not
otherwise
that
if
thou
criest
after
knowledge
and
liftest
up
thy
voice
for
understanding
if
thou
seekest
her
as
silver
and
searchest
for
her
as
for
hid
treasure
then
shalt
thou
understand
the
fear
of
the
lord
and
find
the
knowledge
of
god
this
is
the
dogmatical
principle
which
has
strength
that
truth
and
falsehood
in
religion
are
but
matter
of
opinion
that
one
doctrine
is
as
good
as
another
that
the
governor
of
the
world
does
not
intend
that
we
should
gain
the
truth
that
there
is
no
truth
that
we
are
not
more
acceptable
to
god
by
believing
this
than
by
believing
that
that
no
one
is
answerable
for
his
opinions
that
they
are
a
matter
of
necessity
or
accident
that
it
is
enough
if
we
sincerely
hold
what
we
profess
that
our
merit
lies
in
seeking
not
in
possessing
that
it
is
a
duty
to
follow
what
seems
to
us
true
without
a
fear
lest
it
should
not
be
true
that
it
may
be
a
gain
to
succeed
and
can
be
no
harm
to
fail
that
we
may
take
up
and
lay
down
opinions
at
pleasure
that
belief
belongs
to
the
mere
intellect
not
to
the
heart
also
that
we
may
safely
trust
to
ourselves
in
matters
of
faith
and
need
no
other
guide
this
is
the
principle
of
philosophies
and
heresies
which
is
very
weakness
two
opinions
encounter
each
may
be
abstractedly
true
or
again
each
may
be
a
subtle
comprehensive
doctrine
vigorous
elastic
expansive
various
one
is
held
as
a
matter
of
indifference
the
other
as
a
matter
of
life
and
death
one
is
held
by
the
intellect
only
the
other
also
by
the
heart
it
is
plain
which
of
the
two
must
succumb
to
the
other
such
was
the
conflict
of
christianity
with
the
old
established
paganism
which
was
almost
dead
before
christianity
appeared
with
the
oriental
mysteries
flitting
wildly
to
and
fro
like
spectres
with
the
gnostics
who
made
knowledge
all
in
all
despised
the
many
and
called
catholics
mere
children
in
the
truth
with
the
men
of
literature
pedants
visionaries
or
courtiers
with
the
manichees
who
professed
to
seek
truth
by
reason
not
by
faith
with
the
fluctuating
teachers
of
the
school
of
antioch
the
eusebians
and
the
reckless
versatile
arians
with
the
fanatic
montanists
and
harsh
novatians
who
shrank
from
the
catholic
doctrine
without
power
to
propagate
their
own
these
sects
had
no
stay
or
consistence
yet
they
contained
elements
of
truth
amid
their
error
and
had
christianity
been
as
they
it
might
have
resolved
into
them
but
it
had
that
hold
of
the
truth
which
gave
its
teaching
a
gravity
a
directness
a
consistency
a
sternness
and
a
force
to
which
its
rivals
for
the
most
part
were
strangers
it
could
not
call
evil
good
or
good
evil
because
it
discerned
the
difference
between
them
it
could
not
make
light
of
what
was
so
solemn
or
desert
what
was
so
solid
hence
in
the
collision
it
broke
in
pieces
its
antagonists
and
divided
the
spoils
this
was
but
another
form
of
the
spirit
that
made
martyrs
dogmatism
was
in
teaching
what
confession
was
in
act
each
was
the
same
strong
principle
of
life
in
a
different
aspect
distinguishing
the
faith
which
was
displayed
in
it
from
the
world
philosophies
on
the
one
side
and
the
world
religions
on
the
other
the
heathen
sects
and
the
heresies
of
christian
history
were
dissolved
by
the
breath
of
opinion
which
made
them
paganism
shuddered
and
died
at
the
very
sight
of
the
sword
of
persecution
which
it
had
itself
unsheathed
intellect
and
force
were
applied
as
tests
both
upon
the
divine
and
upon
the
human
work
they
prevailed
with
the
human
they
did
but
become
instruments
of
the
divine
no
one
says
justin
has
so
believed
socrates
as
to
die
for
the
doctrine
which
he
taught
no
one
was
ever
found
undergoing
death
for
faith
in
the
sun
thus
christianity
grew
in
its
proportions
gaining
aliment
and
medicine
from
all
that
it
came
near
yet
preserving
its
original
type
from
its
perception
and
its
love
of
what
had
been
revealed
once
for
all
and
was
no
private
imagination
there
are
writers
who
refer
to
the
first
centuries
of
the
church
as
a
time
when
opinion
was
free
and
the
conscience
exempt
from
the
obligation
or
temptation
to
take
on
trust
what
it
had
not
proved
and
that
apparently
on
the
mere
ground
that
the
series
of
great
theological
decisions
did
not
commence
till
the
fourth
this
seems
to
be
guizot
meaning
when
he
says
that
christianity
in
the
early
ages
was
a
belief
a
sentiment
an
individual
conviction
that
the
christian
society
appears
as
a
pure
association
of
men
animated
by
the
same
sentiments
and
professing
the
same
creed
the
first
christians
he
continues
assembled
to
enjoy
together
the
same
emotions
the
same
religious
convictions
we
do
not
find
any
doctrinal
system
established
any
form
of
discipline
or
of
laws
or
any
body
of
magistrates
what
can
be
meant
by
saying
that
christianity
had
no
magistrates
in
the
earliest
ages
but
any
how
in
statements
such
as
these
the
distinction
is
not
properly
recognized
between
a
principle
and
its
exhibitions
and
instances
even
if
the
fact
were
as
is
represented
the
principle
indeed
of
dogmatism
developes
into
councils
in
the
course
of
time
but
it
was
active
nay
sovereign
from
the
first
in
every
part
of
christendom
a
conviction
that
truth
was
one
that
it
was
a
gift
from
without
a
sacred
trust
an
inestimable
blessing
that
it
was
to
be
reverenced
guarded
defended
transmitted
that
its
absence
was
a
grievous
want
and
its
loss
an
unutterable
calamity
and
again
the
stern
words
and
acts
of
john
of
polycarp
ignatius
iren√¶us
clement
tertullian
and
origen
all
this
is
quite
consistent
with
perplexity
or
mistake
as
to
what
was
truth
in
particular
cases
in
what
way
doubtful
questions
were
to
be
decided
or
what
were
the
limits
of
the
revelation
councils
and
popes
are
the
guardians
and
instruments
of
the
dogmatic
principle
they
are
not
that
principle
themselves
they
presuppose
the
principle
they
are
summoned
into
action
at
the
call
of
the
principle
and
the
principle
might
act
even
before
they
had
their
legitimate
place
and
exercised
a
recognized
power
in
the
movements
of
the
christian
body
the
instance
of
conscience
which
has
already
served
us
in
illustration
may
assist
us
here
what
conscience
is
in
the
history
of
an
individual
mind
such
was
the
dogmatic
principle
in
the
history
of
christianity
both
in
the
one
case
and
the
other
there
is
the
gradual
formation
of
a
directing
power
out
of
a
principle
the
natural
voice
of
conscience
is
far
more
imperative
in
testifying
and
enforcing
a
rule
of
duty
than
successful
in
determining
that
duty
in
particular
cases
it
acts
as
a
messenger
from
above
and
says
that
there
is
a
right
and
a
wrong
and
that
the
right
must
be
followed
but
it
is
variously
and
therefore
erroneously
trained
in
the
instance
of
various
persons
it
mistakes
error
for
truth
and
yet
we
believe
that
on
the
whole
and
even
in
those
cases
where
it
is
if
its
voice
be
diligently
obeyed
it
will
gradually
be
cleared
simplified
and
perfected
so
that
minds
starting
differently
will
if
honest
in
course
of
time
converge
to
one
and
the
same
truth
i
do
not
hereby
imply
that
there
is
indistinctness
so
great
as
this
in
the
theology
of
the
first
centuries
but
so
far
is
plain
that
the
early
church
and
fathers
exercised
far
more
a
than
a
doctor
office
it
was
the
age
of
martyrs
of
acting
not
of
thinking
doctors
succeeded
martyrs
as
light
and
peace
of
conscience
follow
upon
obedience
to
it
yet
even
before
the
church
had
grown
into
the
full
measure
of
its
doctrines
it
was
rooted
in
its
principles
so
far
however
may
be
granted
to
guizot
that
even
principles
were
not
so
well
understood
and
so
carefully
handled
at
first
as
they
were
afterwards
in
the
early
period
we
see
traces
of
a
conflict
as
well
as
of
a
variety
in
theological
elements
which
were
in
course
of
combination
but
which
required
adjustment
and
management
before
they
could
be
used
with
precision
as
one
in
a
thousand
instances
of
a
minor
character
the
statements
of
the
early
fathers
are
but
tokens
of
the
multiplicity
of
openings
which
the
mind
of
the
church
was
making
into
the
of
truth
real
openings
but
incomplete
or
irregular
nay
the
doctrines
even
of
the
heretical
bodies
are
indices
and
anticipations
of
the
mind
of
the
church
as
the
first
step
in
settling
a
question
of
doctrine
is
to
raise
and
debate
it
so
heresies
in
every
age
may
be
taken
as
the
measure
of
the
existing
state
of
thought
in
the
church
and
of
the
movement
of
her
theology
they
determine
in
what
way
the
current
is
setting
and
the
rate
at
which
it
flows
thus
clement
may
be
called
the
representative
of
the
eclectic
element
and
tertullian
of
the
dogmatic
neither
element
as
yet
being
fully
understood
by
catholics
and
clement
perhaps
went
too
far
in
his
accommodation
to
philosophy
and
tertullian
asserted
with
exaggeration
the
immutability
of
the
creed
nay
the
two
antagonist
principles
of
dogmatism
and
assimilation
are
found
in
tertullian
alone
though
with
some
deficiency
of
amalgamation
and
with
a
greater
leaning
towards
the
dogmatic
though
the
montanists
professed
to
pass
over
the
subject
of
doctrine
it
is
chiefly
in
tertullian
montanistic
works
that
his
strong
statements
occur
of
the
unalterableness
of
the
creed
and
extravagance
on
the
subject
is
not
only
in
keeping
with
the
stern
and
vehement
temper
of
that
father
but
with
the
general
severity
and
harshness
of
his
sect
on
the
other
hand
the
very
foundation
of
montanism
is
development
though
not
of
doctrine
yet
of
discipline
and
conduct
it
is
said
that
its
founder
professed
himself
the
promised
comforter
through
whom
the
church
was
to
be
perfected
he
provided
prophets
as
organs
of
the
new
revelation
and
called
catholics
psychici
or
animal
tertullian
distinctly
recognizes
even
the
process
of
development
in
one
of
his
montanistic
works
after
speaking
of
an
innovation
upon
usage
which
his
newly
revealed
truth
required
he
proceeds
therefore
hath
the
lord
sent
the
paraclete
that
since
human
infirmity
could
not
take
all
things
in
at
once
discipline
might
be
gradually
directed
regulated
and
brought
to
perfection
by
the
vicar
the
holy
ghost
have
yet
many
things
to
say
to
you
he
saith
what
is
this
dispensation
of
the
paraclete
but
this
that
discipline
is
directed
scriptures
opened
intellect
reformed
improvements
effected
nothing
can
take
place
without
age
and
all
things
wait
their
time
in
short
the
preacher
says
is
a
time
for
all
things
behold
the
creature
itself
gradually
advancing
to
fruit
at
first
there
is
a
seed
and
a
stalk
springs
out
of
the
seed
and
from
the
stalk
bursts
out
a
shrub
and
then
its
branches
and
foliage
grow
vigorous
and
all
that
we
mean
by
a
tree
is
unfolded
then
there
is
the
swelling
of
the
bud
and
the
bud
is
resolved
into
a
blossom
and
the
blossom
is
opened
into
a
fruit
and
is
for
a
while
rudimental
and
unformed
till
by
degrees
following
out
its
life
it
is
matured
into
mellowness
of
flavour
so
too
righteousness
for
there
is
the
same
god
both
of
righteousness
and
of
the
creation
was
at
first
in
its
rudiments
a
nature
fearing
god
thence
by
means
of
law
and
prophets
it
advanced
into
infancy
thence
by
the
gospel
it
burst
forth
into
its
youth
and
now
by
the
paraclete
it
is
fashioned
into
maturity
not
in
one
principle
or
doctrine
only
but
in
its
whole
system
montanism
is
a
remarkable
anticipation
or
presage
of
developments
which
soon
began
to
show
themselves
in
the
church
though
they
were
not
perfected
for
centuries
after
its
rigid
maintenance
of
the
original
creed
yet
its
admission
of
a
development
at
least
in
the
ritual
has
just
been
instanced
in
the
person
of
tertullian
equally
catholic
in
their
principle
whether
in
fact
or
anticipation
were
most
of
the
other
peculiarities
of
montanism
its
rigorous
fasts
its
visions
its
commendation
of
celibacy
and
martyrdom
its
contempt
of
temporal
goods
its
penitential
discipline
and
its
maintenance
of
a
centre
of
unity
the
doctrinal
determinations
and
the
ecclesiastical
usages
of
the
middle
ages
are
the
true
fulfilment
of
its
and
abortive
attempts
at
precipitating
the
growth
of
the
church
the
favour
shown
to
it
for
a
while
by
pope
victor
is
an
evidence
of
its
external
resemblance
to
orthodoxy
and
the
celebrated
martyrs
and
saints
in
africa
in
the
beginning
of
the
third
century
perpetua
and
felicitas
or
at
least
their
acts
betoken
that
same
peculiar
temper
of
religion
which
when
cut
off
from
the
church
a
few
years
afterwards
quickly
degenerated
into
a
heresy
a
parallel
instance
occurs
in
the
case
of
the
donatists
they
held
a
doctrine
on
the
subject
of
baptism
similar
to
that
of
cyprian
vincentius
lirinensis
says
gibbon
referring
to
remarks
on
that
resemblance
has
explained
why
the
donatists
are
eternally
burning
with
the
devil
while
cyprian
reigns
in
heaven
with
jesus
christ
and
his
reason
is
intelligible
it
is
says
tillemont
as
augustine
often
says
because
the
donatists
had
broken
the
bond
of
peace
and
charity
with
the
other
churches
which
cyprian
had
preserved
so
carefully
these
are
specimens
of
the
raw
material
as
it
may
be
called
which
whether
as
found
in
individual
fathers
within
the
pale
of
the
church
or
in
heretics
external
to
it
she
had
the
power
by
means
of
the
continuity
and
firmness
of
her
principles
to
convert
to
her
own
uses
she
alone
has
succeeded
in
thus
rejecting
evil
without
sacrificing
the
good
and
in
holding
together
in
one
things
which
in
all
other
schools
are
incompatible
gnostic
or
platonic
words
are
found
in
the
inspired
theology
of
john
to
the
platonists
unitarian
writers
trace
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
divinity
gibbon
the
idea
of
the
incarnation
to
the
gnostics
the
gnostics
too
seem
first
to
have
systematically
thrown
the
intellect
upon
matters
of
faith
and
the
very
term
gnostic
has
been
taken
by
clement
to
express
his
perfect
christian
and
though
ascetics
existed
from
the
beginning
the
notion
of
a
religion
higher
than
the
christianity
of
the
many
was
first
prominently
brought
forward
by
the
gnostics
montanists
novatians
and
manichees
and
while
the
prophets
of
the
montanists
prefigure
the
church
doctors
and
their
professed
inspiration
her
infallibility
and
their
revelations
her
developments
and
the
heresiarch
himself
is
the
unsightly
anticipation
of
francis
in
novatian
again
we
discern
the
aspiration
of
nature
after
such
creations
of
grace
as
benedict
or
bruno
and
so
the
effort
of
sabellius
to
complete
the
enunciation
of
the
mystery
of
the
trinity
failed
it
became
a
heresy
grace
would
not
be
constrained
the
course
of
thought
could
not
be
forced
at
length
it
was
realized
in
the
true
unitarianism
of
augustine
doctrine
too
is
percolated
as
it
were
through
different
minds
beginning
with
writers
of
inferior
authority
in
the
church
and
issuing
at
length
in
the
enunciation
of
her
doctors
origen
tertullian
nay
eusebius
and
the
antiochenes
supply
the
materials
from
which
the
fathers
have
wrought
out
comments
or
treatises
gregory
nazianzen
and
st
basil
digested
into
form
the
theological
principles
of
origen
hilary
and
ambrose
are
both
indebted
to
the
same
great
writer
in
their
interpretations
of
scripture
ambrose
again
has
taken
his
comment
on
luke
from
eusebius
and
certain
of
his
tracts
from
philo
cyprian
called
tertullian
his
master
and
traces
of
tertullian
in
his
almost
heretical
treatises
may
be
detected
in
the
most
finished
sentences
of
leo
the
school
of
antioch
in
spite
of
the
heretical
taint
of
various
of
its
masters
formed
the
genius
of
chrysostom
and
the
apocryphal
gospels
have
contributed
many
things
for
the
devotion
and
edification
of
catholic
believers
the
deep
meditation
which
seems
to
have
been
exercised
by
the
fathers
on
points
of
doctrine
the
disputes
and
turbulence
yet
lucid
determination
which
characterize
the
councils
the
indecision
of
popes
are
all
in
different
ways
at
least
when
viewed
together
portions
and
indications
of
the
same
process
the
theology
of
the
church
is
no
random
combination
of
various
opinions
but
a
diligent
patient
working
out
of
one
doctrine
from
many
materials
the
conduct
of
popes
councils
fathers
betokens
the
slow
painful
anxious
taking
up
of
new
truths
into
an
existing
body
of
belief
athanasius
augustine
leo
are
conspicuous
for
the
repetition
of
their
own
theological
statements
on
the
contrary
it
has
been
observed
of
the
heterodox
tertullian
that
his
works
indicate
no
ordinary
fertility
of
mind
in
that
he
so
little
repeats
himself
or
recurs
to
favourite
thoughts
as
is
frequently
the
case
even
with
the
great
st
augustine
here
we
see
the
difference
between
originality
of
mind
and
the
gift
and
calling
of
a
doctor
in
the
church
the
holy
fathers
just
mentioned
were
intently
fixing
their
minds
on
what
they
taught
grasping
it
more
and
more
closely
viewing
it
on
various
sides
trying
its
consistency
weighing
their
own
separate
expressions
and
thus
if
in
some
cases
they
were
even
left
in
ignorance
the
next
generation
of
teachers
completed
their
work
for
the
same
unwearied
anxious
process
of
thought
went
on
gregory
nyssen

the
investigations
of
athanasius

hold

to
consider

cyprian
may
hold
the
unsanctified
state
of
heretics
but
include
in
his
doctrine
a
denial
of
their
baptism
hippolytus
may
believe
in
the
personal
existence
of
the
word
from
eternity
yet
speak
confusedly
on
the

athanasius
and

fathers
may
treat
with
almost
supernatural
exactness
the
doctrine
of
our
lord
incarnation
yet
imply
as
far
as
words
go
that
he
was
ignorant
viewed
in
his
human
nature
the
athanasian
creed
may
admit
the
illustration
of
soul
and
body
and
later
fathers
may
discountenance
it
augustine
might
first
be
opposed
to
the
employment
of
force
in
religion
and
then
acquiesce
in
it
prayers
for
the
faithful
departed
may
be
found
in
the
early
liturgies
yet
with
an
indistinctness
which
included
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
martyrs
in
the
same
rank
with
the
imperfect
christian
whose
sins
were
as
yet
unexpiated
and
succeeding
times
might
keep
what
was
exact
and
supply
what
was
deficient
aristotle
might
be
reprobated
by
certain
early
fathers
yet
furnish
the
phraseology
for
theological
definitions
afterwards
and
in
a
different
isidore
and
others
might
be
suspicious
of
the
decoration
of
churches
paulinus
and
helena
advance
it
and
thus
we
are
brought
on
to
dwell
upon
the
office
of
grace
as
well
as
of
truth
in
enabling
the
church
creed
to
develope
and
to
absorb
without
the
risk
of
corruption
assimilating
power
of
sacramental
there
is
in
truth
a
certain
virtue
or
grace
in
the
gospel
which
changes
the
quality
of
doctrines
opinions
usages
actions
and
personal
characters
when
incorporated
with
it
and
makes
them
right
and
acceptable
to
its
divine
author
whereas
before
they
were
either
infected
with
evil
or
at
best
but
shadows
of
the
truth
this
is
the
principle
above
spoken
of
which
i
have
called
the
sacramental
we
know
that
we
are
of
god
and
the
whole
world
lieth
in
wickedness
is
an
enunciation
of
the
principle
or
the
declaration
of
the
apostle
of
the
gentiles
if
any
man
be
in
christ
he
is
a
new
creature
old
things
are
passed
away
behold
all
things
are
become
new
thus
it
is
that
outward
rites
which
are
but
worthless
in
themselves
lose
their
earthly
character
and
become
sacraments
under
the
gospel
circumcision
as
paul
says
is
carnal
and
has
come
to
an
end
yet
baptism
is
a
perpetual
ordinance
as
being
grafted
upon
a
system
which
is
grace
and
truth
elsewhere
he
parallels
while
he
contrasts
the
cup
of
the
lord
and
the
cup
of
devils
in
this
respect
that
to
partake
of
either
is
to
hold
communion
with
the
source
from
which
it
comes
and
he
adds
presently
that
we
have
been
all
made
to
drink
into
one
spirit
so
again
he
says
no
one
is
justified
by
the
works
of
the
old
law
while
both
he
implies
and
james
declares
that
christians
are
justified
by
works
of
the
new
law
again
he
contrasts
the
exercises
of
the
intellect
as
exhibited
by
heathen
and
christian
howbeit
he
says
after
condemning
heathen
wisdom
we
speak
wisdom
among
them
that
are
perfect
yet
not
the
wisdom
of
this
world
and
it
is
plain
that
nowhere
need
we
look
for
more
glowing
eloquence
more
distinct
profession
of
reasoning
more
careful
assertion
of
doctrine
than
is
to
be
found
in
the
apostle
writings
in
like
manner
when
the
jewish
exorcists
attempted
to
call
over
them
which
had
evil
spirits
the
name
of
the
lord
jesus
the
evil
spirit
professed
not
to
know
them
and
inflicted
on
them
a
bodily
injury
on
the
other
hand
the
occasion
of
this
attempt
of
theirs
was
a
stupendous
instance
or
type
in
the
person
of
paul
of
the
very
principle
i
am
illustrating
god
wrought
special
miracles
by
the
hands
of
paul
so
that
from
his
body
were
brought
unto
the
sick
handkerchiefs
and
aprons
and
the
diseases
departed
from
them
and
the
evil
spirits
went
out
of
them
the
grace
given
him
was
communicable
diffusive
an
influence
passing
from
him
to
others
and
making
what
it
touched
spiritual
as
enthusiasm
may
be
or
tastes
or
panics
parallel
instances
occur
of
the
operation
of
this
principle
in
the
history
of
the
church
from
the
time
that
the
apostles
were
taken
from
it
paul
denounces
distinctions
in
meat
and
drink
the
observance
of
sabbaths
and
holydays
and
of
ordinances
and
the
worship
of
angels
yet
christians
from
the
first
were
rigid
in
their
stated
fastings
venerated
as
justin
tells
us
the
angelic
intelligences
and
established
the
observance
of
the
lord
day
as
soon
as
persecution
ceased
in
like
manner
celsus
objects
that
christians
did
not
endure
the
sight
of
temples
altars
and
statues
porphyry
that
they
blame
the
rites
of
worship
victims
and
frankincense
the
heathen
disputant
in
minucius
asks
why
have
christians
no
altars
no
temples
no
conspicuous
images
and
no
sacrifices
and
yet
it
is
plain
from
tertullian
that
christians
had
altars
of
their
own
and
sacrifices
and
priests
and
that
they
had
churches
is
again
and
again
proved
by
eusebius
who
had
seen
the
houses
of
prayer
levelled
in
the
dioclesian
persecution
from
the
history
too
of
gregory
thaumaturgus
nay
from
clement
again
justin
and
minucius
speak
of
the
form
of
the
cross
in
terms
of
reverence
quite
inconsistent
with
the
doctrine
that
external
emblems
of
religion
may
not
be
venerated
tertullian
speaks
of
christians
signing
themselves
with
it
whatever
they
set
about
whether
they
walk
eat
or
lie
down
to
sleep
in
eusebius
life
of
constantine
the
figure
of
the
cross
holds
a
most
conspicuous
place
the
emperor
sees
it
in
the
sky
and
is
converted
he
places
it
upon
his
standards
he
inserts
it
into
his
own
hand
when
he
puts
up
his
statue
wherever
the
cross
is
displayed
in
his
battles
he
conquers
he
appoints
fifty
men
to
carry
it
he
engraves
it
on
his
soldiers
arms
and
licinius
dreads
its
power
shortly
after
julian
plainly
accuses
christians
of
worshipping
the
wood
of
the
cross
though
they
refused
to
worship
the
in
a
later
age
the
worship
of
images
was
introduced
the
principle
of
the
distinction
by
which
these
observances
were
pious
in
christianity
and
superstitious
in
paganism
is
implied
in
such
passages
of
tertullian
lactantius
and
others
as
speak
of
evil
spirits
lurking
under
the
pagan
statues
it
is
intimated
also
by
origen
who
after
saying
that
scripture
so
strongly
forbids
temples
altars
and
images
that
christians
are
ready
to
go
to
death
if
necessary
rather
than
pollute
their
notion
of
the
god
of
all
by
any
such
transgression
assigns
as
a
reason
that
as
far
as
possible
they
might
not
fall
into
the
notion
that
images
were
gods
augustine
in
replying
to
porphyry
is
more
express
those
he
says
who
are
acquainted
with
old
and
new
testament
do
not
blame
in
the
pagan
religion
the
erection
of
temples
or
institution
of
priesthoods
but
that
these
are
done
to
idols
and
devils
true
religion
blames
in
their
superstitions
not
so
much
their
sacrificing
for
the
ancient
saints
sacrificed
to
the
true
god
as
their
sacrificing
to
false
gods
to
faustus
the
manichee
he
answers
we
have
some
things
in
common
with
the
gentiles
but
our
purpose
is
different
and
jerome
asks
vigilantius
who
made
objections
to
lights
and
oil
because
we
once
worshipped
idols
is
that
a
reason
why
we
should
not
worship
god
for
fear
of
seeming
to
address
him
with
an
honour
like
that
which
was
paid
to
idols
and
then
was
detestable
whereas
this
is
paid
to
martyrs
and
therefore
to
be
received
confiding
then
in
the
power
of
christianity
to
resist
the
infection
of
evil
and
to
transmute
the
very
instruments
and
appendages
of
to
an
evangelical
use
and
feeling
also
that
these
usages
had
originally
come
from
primitive
revelations
and
from
the
instinct
of
nature
though
they
had
been
corrupted
and
that
they
must
invent
what
they
needed
if
they
did
not
use
what
they
found
and
that
they
were
moreover
possessed
of
the
very
archetypes
of
which
paganism
attempted
the
shadows
the
rulers
of
the
church
from
early
times
were
prepared
should
the
occasion
arise
to
adopt
or
imitate
or
sanction
the
existing
rites
and
customs
of
the
populace
as
well
as
the
philosophy
of
the
educated
class
gregory
thaumaturgus
supplies
the
first
instance
on
record
of
this
economy
he
was
the
apostle
of
pontus
and
one
of
his
methods
for
governing
an
untoward
population
is
thus
related
by
gregory
of
nyssa
on
returning
he
says
to
the
city
after
revisiting
the
country
round
about
he
increased
the
devotion
of
the
people
everywhere
by
instituting
festive
meetings
in
honour
of
those
who
had
fought
for
the
faith
the
bodies
of
the
martyrs
were
distributed
in
different
places
and
the
people
assembled
and
made
merry
as
the
year
came
round
holding
festival
in
their
honour
this
indeed
was
a
proof
of
his
great
wisdom
for
perceiving
that
the
childish
and
untrained
populace
were
retained
in
their
idolatrous
error
by
creature
comforts
in
order
that
what
was
of
first
importance
should
at
any
rate
be
secured
to
them
viz
that
they
should
look
to
god
in
place
of
their
vain
rites
he
allowed
them
to
be
merry
jovial
and
gay
at
the
monuments
of
the
holy
martyrs
as
if
their
behaviour
would
in
time
undergo
a
spontaneous
change
into
greater
seriousness
and
strictness
since
faith
would
lead
them
to
it
which
has
actually
been
the
happy
issue
in
that
population
all
carnal
gratification
having
turned
into
a
spiritual
form
of
rejoicing
there
is
no
reason
to
suppose
that
the
licence
here
spoken
of
passed
the
limits
of
harmless
though
rude
festivity
for
it
is
observable
that
the
same
reason
the
need
of
holydays
for
the
multitude
is
assigned
by
origen
gregory
master
to
explain
the
establishment
of
the
lord
day
also
and
the
paschal
and
the
pentecostal
festivals
which
have
never
been
viewed
as
unlawful
compliances
and
moreover
the
people
were
in
fact
eventually
reclaimed
from
their
gross
habits
by
his
indulgent
policy
a
successful
issue
which
could
not
have
followed
an
accommodation
to
what
was
sinful
the
example
set
by
gregory
in
an
age
of
persecution
was
impetuously
followed
when
a
time
of
peace
succeeded
in
the
course
of
the
fourth
century
two
movements
or
developments
spread
over
the
face
of
christendom
with
a
rapidity
characteristic
of
the
church
the
one
ascetic
the
other
ritual
or
ceremonial
we
are
told
in
various
ways
by
eusebius
that
constantine
in
order
to
recommend
the
new
religion
to
the
heathen
transferred
into
it
the
outward
ornaments
to
which
they
had
been
accustomed
in
their
own
it
is
not
necessary
to
go
into
a
subject
which
the
diligence
of
protestant
writers
has
made
familiar
to
most
of
us
the
use
of
temples
and
these
dedicated
to
particular
saints
and
ornamented
on
occasions
with
branches
of
trees
incense
lamps
and
candles
votive
offerings
on
recovery
from
illness
holy
water
asylums
holydays
and
seasons
use
of
calendars
processions
blessings
on
the
fields
sacerdotal
vestments
the
tonsure
the
ring
in
marriage
turning
to
the
east
images
at
a
later
date
perhaps
the
ecclesiastical
chant
and
the
kyrie
eleison
are
all
of
pagan
origin
and
sanctified
by
their
adoption
into
the
church
the
eighth
book
of
theodoret
work
which
is
on
the
martyrs
treats
so
largely
on
the
subject
that
we
must
content
ourselves
with
only
a
specimen
of
the
illustrations
which
it
affords
of
the
principle
acted
on
by
gregory
thaumaturgus
time
which
makes
all
things
decay
he
says
speaking
of
the
martyrs
has
preserved
their
glory
incorruptible
for
as
the
noble
souls
of
those
conquerors
traverse
the
heavens
and
take
part
in
the
spiritual
choirs
so
their
bodies
are
not
consigned
to
separate
tombs
but
cities
and
towns
divide
them
among
them
and
call
them
saviours
of
souls
and
bodies
and
physicians
and
honour
them
as
the
protectors
and
guardians
of
cities
and
using
their
intervention
with
the
lord
of
all
obtain
through
them
divine
gifts
and
though
each
body
be
divided
the
grace
remains
indivisible
and
that
small
that
tiny
particle
is
equal
in
power
with
the
martyr
that
hath
never
been
dispersed
about
for
the
grace
which
is
ever
blossoming
distributes
the
gifts
measuring
the
bounty
according
to
the
faith
of
those
who
come
for
it
yet
not
even
this
persuades
you
to
celebrate
their
god
but
ye
laugh
and
mock
at
the
honour
which
is
paid
them
by
all
and
consider
it
a
pollution
to
approach
their
tombs
but
though
all
men
made
a
jest
of
them
yet
at
least
the
greeks
could
not
decently
complain
to
whom
belonged
libations
and
expiations
and
heroes
and
and
deified
men
to
hercules
though
a
man
and
compelled
to
serve
eurystheus
they
built
temples
and
constructed
altars
and
offered
sacrifices
in
honour
and
allotted
feasts
and
that
not
spartans
only
and
athenians
but
the
whole
of
greece
and
the
greater
part
of
europe
then
after
going
through
the
history
of
many
heathen
deities
and
referring
to
the
doctrine
of
the
philosophers
about
great
men
and
to
the
monuments
of
kings
and
emperors
all
of
which
at
once
are
witnesses
and
are
inferior
to
the
greatness
of
the
martyrs
he
continues
to
their
shrines
we
come
not
once
or
twice
a
year
or
five
times
but
often
do
we
hold
celebrations
often
nay
daily
do
we
present
hymns
to
their
lord
and
the
sound
in
health
ask
for
its
preservation
and
those
who
struggle
with
any
disease
for
a
release
from
their
sufferings
the
childless
for
children
the
barren
to
become
mothers
and
those
who
enjoy
the
blessing
for
its
safe
keeping
those
too
who
are
setting
out
for
a
foreign
land
beg
that
the
martyrs
may
be
their
and
guides
of
the
journey
those
who
have
come
safe
back
acknowledge
the
grace
not
coming
to
them
as
to
gods
but
beseeching
them
as
divine
men
and
asking
their
intercession
and
that
they
obtain
what
they
ask
in
faith
their
dedications
openly
witness
in
token
of
their
cure
for
some
bring
likenesses
of
eyes
others
of
feet
others
of
hands
some
of
gold
others
of
silver
and
their
lord
accepts
even
the
small
and
cheap
measuring
the
gift
by
the
offerer
ability
philosophers
and
orators
are
consigned
to
oblivion
and
kings
and
captains
are
not
known
even
by
name
to
the
many
but
the
names
of
the
martyrs
are
better
known
to
all
than
the
names
of
those
dearest
to
them
and
they
make
a
point
of
giving
them
to
their
children
with
a
view
of
gaining
for
them
thereby
safety
and
protection
nay
of
the
gods
so
utterly
have
the
sacred
places
been
destroyed
that
not
even
their
outline
remains
nor
the
shape
of
their
altars
is
known
to
men
of
this
generation
while
their
materials
have
been
dedicated
to
the
shrines
of
the
martyrs
for
the
lord
has
introduced
his
own
dead
in
place
of
your
gods
of
the
one
he
hath
made
a
riddance
on
the
other
he
hath
conferred
their
honours
for
the
pandian
festival
the
diasia
and
the
dionysia
and
your
other
such
we
have
the
feasts
of
peter
of
paul
of
thomas
of
sergius
of
marcellus
of
leontius
of
pantele√´mon
of
antony
of
maurice
and
of
the
other
martyrs
and
for
that
procession
and
indecency
of
work
and
word
are
held
modest
festivities
without
intemperance
or
revel
or
laughter
but
with
divine
hymns
and
attendance
on
holy
discourses
and
prayers
adorned
with
laudable
tears
this
was
the
view
of
the
evidences
of
christianity
which
a
bishop
of
the
fifth
century
offered
for
the
conversion
of
unbelievers
the
introduction
of
images
was
still
later
and
met
with
more
opposition
in
the
west
than
in
the
east
it
is
grounded
on
the
same
great
principle
which
i
am
illustrating
and
as
i
have
given
extracts
from
theodoret
for
the
developments
of
the
fourth
and
fifth
centuries
so
will
i
now
cite
john
damascene
in
defence
of
the
further
developments
of
the
eighth
as
to
the
passages
you
adduce
he
says
to
his
opponents
they
abominate
not
the
worship
paid
to
our
images
but
that
of
the
greeks
who
made
them
gods
it
needs
not
therefore
because
of
the
absurd
use
of
the
greeks
to
abolish
our
use
which
is
so
pious
enchanters
and
wizards
use
adjurations
so
does
the
church
over
its
catechumens
but
they
invoke
devils
and
she
invokes
god
against
devils
greeks
dedicate
images
to
devils
and
call
them
gods
but
we
to
true
god
incarnate
and
to
god
servants
and
friends
who
drive
away
the
troops
of
devils
again
as
the
holy
fathers
overthrew
the
temples
and
shrines
of
the
devils
and
raised
in
their
places
shrines
in
the
names
of
saints
and
we
worship
them
so
also
they
overthrew
the
images
of
the
devils
and
in
their
stead
raised
images
of
christ
and
god
mother
and
the
saints
and
under
the
old
covenant
israel
neither
raised
temples
in
the
name
of
men
nor
was
memory
of
man
made
a
festival
for
as
yet
man
nature
was
under
a
curse
and
death
was
condemnation
and
therefore
was
lamented
and
a
corpse
was
reckoned
unclean
and
he
who
touched
it
but
now
that
the
godhead
has
been
combined
with
our
nature
as
some
and
saving
medicine
our
nature
has
been
glorified
and
is
into
incorruption
wherefore
the
death
of
saints
is
made
a
feast
and
temples
are
raised
to
them
and
images
are
painted
for
the
image
is
a
triumph
and
a
manifestation
and
a
monument
in
memory
of
the
victory
of
those
who
have
done
nobly
and
excelled
and
of
the
shame
of
the
devils
defeated
and
overthrown
once
more
if
because
of
the
law
thou
dost
forbid
images
you
will
soon
have
to
sabbatize
and
be
circumcised
for
these
ordinances
the
law
commands
as
indispensable
nay
to
observe
the
whole
law
and
not
to
keep
the
festival
of
the
lord
pascha
out
of
jerusalem
but
know
that
if
you
keep
the
law
christ
hath
profited
you
nothing
but
away
with
this
for
whoever
of
you
are
justified
in
the
law
have
fallen
from
grace
it
is
quite
consistent
with
the
tenor
of
these
remarks
to
observe
or
to
allow
that
real
superstitions
have
sometimes
obtained
in
parts
of
christendom
from
its
intercourse
with
the
heathen
or
have
even
been
admitted
or
all
but
admitted
though
commonly
resisted
strenuously
by
authorities
in
the
church
in
consequence
of
the
resemblance
which
exists
between
the
heathen
rites
and
certain
portions
of
her
ritual
as
philosophy
has
at
times
corrupted
her
divines
so
has
paganism
corrupted
her
worshippers
and
as
the
more
intellectual
have
been
involved
in
heresy
so
have
the
ignorant
been
corrupted
by
superstition
thus
chrysostom
is
vehement
against
the
superstitious
usages
which
jews
and
gentiles
were
introducing
among
christians
at
antioch
and
constantinople
what
shall
we
say
he
asks
in
one
place
about
the
amulets
and
bells
which
are
hung
upon
the
hands
and
the
scarlet
woof
and
other
things
full
of
such
extreme
folly
when
they
ought
to
invest
the
child
with
nothing
else
save
the
protection
of
the
cross
but
now
that
is
despised
which
hath
converted
the
whole
world
and
given
the
sore
wound
to
the
devil
and
overthrown
all
his
power
while
the
thread
and
the
woof
and
the
other
amulets
of
that
kind
are
entrusted
with
the
child
safety
after
mentioning
further
superstitions
he
proceeds
now
that
among
greeks
such
things
should
be
done
is
no
wonder
but
among
the
worshippers
of
the
cross
and
partakers
in
unspeakable
mysteries
and
professors
of
such
morality
that
such
unseemliness
should
prevail
this
is
especially
to
be
deplored
again
and
again
and
in
like
manner
augustine
suppressed
the
feasts
called
agap√¶
which
had
been
allowed
the
african
christians
on
their
first
conversion
it
is
time
he
says
for
men
who
dare
not
deny
that
they
are
christians
to
begin
to
live
according
to
the
will
of
christ
and
now
being
christians
to
reject
what
was
only
allowed
that
they
might
become
christians
the
people
objected
the
example
of
the
vatican
church
at
rome
where
such
feasts
were
observed
every
day
augustine
answered
i
have
heard
that
it
has
been
often
prohibited
but
the
place
is
far
off
from
the
bishop
abode
the
lateran
and
in
so
large
a
city
there
is
a
multitude
of
carnal
persons
especially
of
strangers
who
resort
daily
thither
and
in
like
manner
it
certainly
is
possible
that
the
consciousness
of
the
sanctifying
power
in
christianity
may
have
acted
as
a
temptation
to
sins
whether
of
deceit
or
of
violence
as
if
the
habit
or
state
of
grace
destroyed
the
sinfulness
of
certain
acts
or
as
if
the
end
justified
the
means
it
is
but
enunciating
in
other
words
the
principle
we
are
tracing
to
say
that
the
church
has
been
entrusted
with
the
dispensation
of
grace
for
if
she
can
convert
heathen
appointments
into
spiritual
rites
and
usages
what
is
this
but
to
be
in
possession
of
a
treasure
and
to
exercise
a
discretionary
power
in
its
application
hence
there
has
been
from
the
first
much
variety
and
change
in
the
sacramental
acts
and
instruments
which
she
has
used
while
the
eastern
and
african
churches
baptized
heretics
on
their
reconciliation
the
church
of
rome
as
the
catholic
church
since
maintained
that
imposition
of
hands
was
sufficient
if
their
prior
baptism
had
been
formally
correct
the
ceremony
of
imposition
of
hands
was
used
on
various
occasions
with
a
distinct
meaning
at
the
rite
of
catechumens
on
admitting
heretics
in
confirmation
in
ordination
in
benediction
baptism
was
sometimes
administered
by
immersion
sometimes
by
infusion
infant
baptism
was
not
at
first
enforced
as
afterwards
children
or
even
infants
were
admitted
to
the
eucharist
in
the
african
church
and
the
rest
of
the
west
as
now
in
the
greek
oil
had
various
uses
as
for
healing
the
sick
or
as
in
the
rite
of
extreme
unction
indulgences
in
works
or
in
periods
of
penance
had
a
different
meaning
according
to
circumstances
in
like
manner
the
sign
of
the
cross
was
one
of
the
earliest
means
of
grace
then
holy
seasons
and
holy
places
and
pilgrimage
to
them
holy
water
prescribed
prayers
or
other
observances
garments
as
the
scapular
and
sacred
vestments
the
rosary
the
crucifix
and
for
some
wise
purpose
doubtless
such
as
that
of
showing
the
power
of
the
church
in
the
dispensation
of
divine
grace
as
well
as
the
perfection
and
spirituality
of
the
eucharistic
presence
the
chalice
is
in
the
west
withheld
from
all
but
the
celebrant
in
the
holy
eucharist
since
it
has
been
represented
as
if
the
power
of
assimilation
spoken
of
in
this
chapter
is
in
my
meaning
nothing
more
than
a
mere
accretion
of
doctrines
or
rites
from
without
i
am
led
to
quote
the
following
passage
in
further
illustration
of
it
from
my
essays
vol
ii
the
phenomenon
admitted
on
all
hands
is
this
that
great
portion
of
what
is
generally
received
as
christian
truth
is
in
its
rudiments
or
in
its
separate
parts
to
be
found
in
heathen
philosophies
and
religions
for
instance
the
doctrine
of
a
trinity
is
found
both
in
the
east
and
in
the
west
so
is
the
ceremony
of
washing
so
is
the
rite
of
sacrifice
the
doctrine
of
the
divine
word
is
platonic
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
is
indian
of
a
divine
kingdom
is
judaic
of
angels
and
demons
is
magian
the
connexion
of
sin
with
the
body
is
gnostic
celibacy
is
known
to
bonze
and
talapoin
a
sacerdotal
order
is
egyptian
the
idea
of
a
new
birth
is
chinese
and
eleusinian
belief
in
sacramental
virtue
is
pythagorean
and
honours
to
the
dead
are
a
polytheism
such
is
the
general
nature
of
the
fact
before
us
milman
argues
from
it
things
are
in
heathenism
therefore
they
are
not
christian
we
on
the
contrary
prefer
to
say
things
are
in
christianity
therefore
they
are
not
heathen
that
is
we
prefer
to
say
and
we
think
that
scripture
bears
us
out
in
saying
that
from
the
beginning
the
moral
governor
of
the
world
has
scattered
the
seeds
of
truth
far
and
wide
over
its
extent
that
these
have
variously
taken
root
and
grown
up
as
in
the
wilderness
wild
plants
indeed
but
living
and
hence
that
as
the
inferior
animals
have
tokens
of
an
immaterial
principle
in
them
yet
have
not
souls
so
the
philosophies
and
religions
of
men
have
their
life
in
certain
true
ideas
though
they
are
not
directly
divine
what
man
is
amid
the
brute
creation
such
is
the
church
among
the
schools
of
the
world
and
as
adam
gave
names
to
the
animals
about
him
so
has
the
church
from
the
first
looked
round
upon
the
earth
noting
and
visiting
the
doctrines
she
found
there
she
began
in
chaldea
and
then
sojourned
among
the
canaanites
and
went
down
into
egypt
and
thence
passed
into
arabia
till
she
rested
in
her
own
land
next
she
encountered
the
merchants
of
tyre
and
the
wisdom
of
the
east
country
and
the
luxury
of
sheba
then
she
was
carried
away
to
babylon
and
wandered
to
the
schools
of
greece
and
wherever
she
went
in
trouble
or
in
triumph
still
she
was
a
living
spirit
the
mind
and
voice
of
the
most
high
in
the
midst
of
the
doctors
both
hearing
them
and
asking
them
questions
claiming
to
herself
what
they
said
rightly
correcting
their
errors
supplying
their
defects
completing
their
beginnings
expanding
their
surmises
and
thus
gradually
by
means
of
them
enlarging
the
range
and
refining
the
sense
of
her
own
teaching
so
far
then
from
her
creed
being
of
doubtful
credit
because
it
resembles
foreign
theologies
we
even
hold
that
one
special
way
in
which
providence
has
imparted
divine
knowledge
to
us
has
been
by
enabling
her
to
draw
and
collect
it
together
out
of
the
world
and
in
this
sense
as
in
others
to
the
milk
of
the
gentiles
and
to
suck
the
breast
of
kings
how
far
in
fact
this
process
has
gone
is
a
question
of
history
and
we
believe
it
has
before
now
been
grossly
exaggerated
and
misrepresented
by
those
who
like
milman
have
thought
that
its
existence
told
against
catholic
doctrine
but
so
little
antecedent
difficulty
have
we
in
the
matter
that
we
could
readily
grant
unless
it
were
a
question
of
fact
not
of
theory
that
balaam
was
an
eastern
sage
or
a
sibyl
was
inspired
or
solomon
learnt
of
the
sons
of
mahol
or
moses
was
a
scholar
of
the
egyptian
hierophants
we
are
not
distressed
to
be
told
that
the
doctrine
of
the
angelic
host
came
from
babylon
while
we
know
that
they
did
sing
at
the
nativity
nor
that
the
vision
of
a
mediator
is
in
philo
if
in
very
deed
he
died
for
us
on
calvary
nor
are
we
afraid
to
allow
that
even
after
his
coming
the
church
has
been
a
giving
forth
things
old
and
new
casting
the
gold
of
fresh
tributaries
into
her
refiner
fire
or
stamping
upon
her
own
as
time
required
it
a
deeper
impress
of
her
master
image
the
distinction
between
these
two
theories
is
broad
and
obvious
the
advocates
of
the
one
imply
that
revelation
was
a
single
entire
solitary
act
or
nearly
so
introducing
a
certain
message
whereas
we
who
maintain
the
other
consider
that
divine
teaching
has
been
in
fact
what
the
analogy
of
nature
would
lead
us
to
expect
sundry
times
and
in
divers
manners
various
complex
progressive
and
supplemental
of
itself
we
consider
the
christian
doctrine
when
analyzed
to
appear
like
the
human
frame
and
wonderfully
made
but
they
think
it
some
one
tenet
or
certain
principles
given
out
at
one
time
in
their
fulness
without
gradual
enlargement
before
christ
coming
or
elucidation
afterwards
they
cast
off
all
that
they
also
find
in
pharisee
or
heathen
we
conceive
that
the
church
like
aaron
rod
devours
the
serpents
of
the
magicians
they
are
ever
hunting
for
a
fabulous
primitive
simplicity
we
repose
in
catholic
fulness
they
seek
what
never
has
been
found
we
accept
and
use
what
even
they
acknowledge
to
be
a
substance
they
are
driven
to
maintain
on
their
part
that
the
church
doctrine
was
never
pure
we
say
that
it
can
never
be
corrupt
we
consider
that
a
divine
promise
keeps
the
church
catholic
from
doctrinal
corruption
but
on
what
promise
or
on
what
encouragement
they
are
seeking
for
their
visionary
purity

application
of
the
fourth
note
of
a
true
development
logical
sequence
logical
sequence
has
been
set
down
above
as
a
fourth
test
of
fidelity
in
development
and
shall
now
be
briefly
illustrated
in
the
history
of
christian
doctrine
that
is
i
mean
to
give
instances
of
one
doctrine
leading
to
another
so
that
if
the
former
be
admitted
the
latter
can
hardly
be
denied
and
the
latter
can
hardly
be
called
a
corruption
without
taking
exception
to
the
former
and
i
use
logical
sequence
in
contrast
both
to
that
process
of
incorporation
and
assimilation
which
was
last
under
review
and
also
to
that
principle
of
science
which
has
put
into
order
and
defended
the
developments
after
they
have
been
made
accordingly
it
will
include
any
progress
of
the
mind
from
one
judgment
to
another
as
for
instance
by
way
of
moral
fitness
which
may
not
admit
of
analysis
into
premiss
and
conclusion
thus
peter
argued
in
the
case
of
cornelius
and
his
friends
can
any
man
forbid
water
that
these
should
not
be
baptized
which
have
received
the
holy
ghost
as
well
as
we
such
is
the
series
of
doctrinal
truths
which
start
from
the
dogma
of
our
lord
divinity
and
again
from
such
texts
of
scripture
as
thou
art
peter
and
which
i
should
have
introduced
here
had
i
not
already
used
them
for
a
previous
purpose
in
the
fourth
chapter
i
shall
confine
myself
then
for
an
example
to
the
instance
of
the
developments
which
follow
on
the
consideration
of
sin
after
baptism
a
subject
which
was
touched
upon
in
the
same
chapter
it
is
not
necessary
here
to
enlarge
on
the
benefits
which
the
primitive
church
held
to
be
conveyed
to
the
soul
by
means
of
the
sacrament
of
baptism
its
distinguishing
gift
which
is
in
point
to
mention
was
the
plenary
forgiveness
of
sins
past
it
was
also
held
that
the
sacrament
could
not
be
repeated
the
question
immediately
followed
how
since
there
was
but
one
baptism
for
the
remission
of
sins
the
guilt
of
such
sin
was
to
be
removed
as
was
incurred
after
its
administration
there
must
be
some
provision
in
the
revealed
system
for
so
obvious
a
need
what
could
be
done
for
those
who
had
received
the
one
remission
of
sins
and
had
sinned
since
some
who
thought
upon
the
subject
appear
to
have
conceived
that
the
church
was
empowered
to
grant
one
and
one
only
reconciliation
after
grievous
offences
three
sins
seemed
to
many
at
least
in
the
west
to
be
irremissible
idolatry
murder
and
adultery
but
such
a
system
of
church
discipline
however
suited
to
a
small
community
and
even
expedient
in
a
time
of
persecution
could
not
exist
in
christianity
as
it
spread
into
the
and
gathered
like
a
net
of
every
kind
a
more
indulgent
rule
gradually
gained
ground
yet
the
spanish
church
adhered
to
the
ancient
even
in
the
fourth
century
and
a
portion
of
the
african
in
the
third
and
in
the
remaining
portion
there
was
a
relaxation
only
as
regards
the
crime
of
incontinence
meanwhile
a
protest
was
made
against
the
growing
innovation
at
the
beginning
of
the
third
century
montanus
who
was
a
zealot
for
the
more
primitive
rule
shrank
from
the
laxity
as
he
considered
it
of
the
asian
churches
as
in
a
different
jovinian
and
vigilantius
were
offended
at
the
developments
in
divine
worship
in
the
century
which
followed
the
montanists
had
recourse
to
the
see
of
rome
and
at
first
with
some
appearance
of
success
again
in
africa
where
there
had
been
in
the
first
instance
a
schism
headed
by
felicissimus
in
favour
of
a
milder
discipline
than
cyprian
approved
a
far
more
formidable
stand
was
soon
made
in
favour
of
antiquity
headed
by
novatus
who
originally
had
been
of
the
party
of
felicissimus
this
was
taken
up
at
rome
by
novatian
who
professed
to
adhere
to
the
original
or
at
least
the
primitive
rule
of
the
church
viz
that
those
who
had
once
fallen
from
the
faith
could
in
no
case
be
received
again
the
controversy
seems
to
have
found
the
following
issue
whether
the
church
had
the
of
pardoning
sins
committed
after
baptism
which
the
novatians
at
least
practically
denied
it
is
fitting
says
the
novatian
acesius
to
exhort
those
who
have
sinned
after
baptism
to
repentance
but
to
expect
hope
of
remission
not
from
the
priests
but
from
god
who
hath
power
to
forgive
sins
the
schism
spread
into
the
east
and
led
to
the
appointment
of
a
penitentiary
priest
in
the
catholic
churches
by
the
end
of
the
third
century
as
many
as
four
degrees
of
penance
were
appointed
through
which
offenders
had
to
pass
in
order
to
a
reconciliation
the
length
and
severity
of
the
penance
varied
with
times
and
places
sometimes
as
we
have
seen
it
lasted
in
the
case
of
grave
offences
through
life
and
on
to
death
without
any
reconciliation
at
other
times
it
ended
only
in
the
and
if
after
reconciliation
they
did
not
die
their
ordinary
penance
was
still
binding
on
them
either
for
life
or
for
a
certain
time
in
other
cases
it
lasted
ten
fifteen
or
twenty
years
but
in
all
cases
from
the
first
the
bishop
had
the
power
of
shortening
it
and
of
altering
the
nature
and
quality
of
the
punishment
thus
in
the
instance
of
the
emperor
theodosius
whom
ambrose
shut
out
from
communion
for
the
massacre
at
thessalonica
according
to
the
mildest
rules
of
ecclesiastical
discipline
which
were
established
in
the
fourth
century
says
gibbon
the
crime
of
homicide
was
expiated
by
the
penitence
of
twenty
years
and
as
it
was
impossible
in
the
period
of
human
life
to
purge
the
accumulated
guilt
of
the
massacre
the
murderer
should
have
been
excluded
from
the
holy
communion
till
the
hour
of
his
death
he
goes
on
to
say
that
the
public
edification
which
resulted
from
the
humiliation
of
so
illustrious
a
penitent
was
a
reason
for
abridging
the
punishment
it
was
sufficient
that
the
emperor
of
the
romans
stripped
of
the
ensigns
of
royalty
should
appear
in
a
mournful
and
suppliant
posture
and
that
in
the
midst
of
the
church
of
milan
he
should
humbly
solicit
with
sighs
and
tears
the
pardon
of
his
sins
his
penance
was
shortened
to
an
interval
of
about
eight
months
hence
arose
the
phrase
of
a
legitima
plena
et
which
signifies
a
penance
sufficient
perhaps
in
length
of
time
perhaps
in
intensity
of
punishment
here
a
serious
question
presented
itself
to
the
minds
of
christians
which
was
now
to
be
wrought
out
were
these
punishments
merely
signs
of
contrition
or
in
any
sense
satisfactions
for
sin
if
the
former
they
might
be
absolutely
remitted
at
the
discretion
of
the
church
as
soon
as
true
repentance
was
discovered
the
end
had
then
been
attained
and
nothing
more
was
necessary
thus
chrysostom
says
in
one
of
his
homilies
i
require
not
continuance
of
time
but
the
correction
of
the
soul
show
your
contrition
show
your
reformation
and
all
is
done
yet
though
there
might
be
a
reason
of
the
moment
for
shortening
the
penance
imposed
by
the
church
this
does
not
at
all
decide
the
question
whether
that
ecclesiastical
penance
be
not
part
of
an
expiation
made
to
the
almighty
judge
for
the
sin
and
supposing
this
really
to
be
the
case
the
question
follows
how
is
the
complement
of
that
satisfaction
to
be
wrought
out
which
on
just
grounds
of
present
expedience
has
been
suspended
by
the
church
now
as
to
this
question
it
can
not
be
doubted
that
the
fathers
considered
penance
as
not
a
mere
expression
of
contrition
but
as
an
act
done
directly
towards
god
and
a
means
of
averting
his
anger
if
the
sinner
spare
not
himself
he
will
be
spared
by
god
says
the
writer
who
goes
under
the
name
of
ambrose
let
him
lie
in
sackcloth
and
by
the
austerity
of
his
life
make
amends
for
the
offence
of
his
past
pleasures
says
jerome
as
we
have
sinned
greatly
says
cyprian
let
us
weep
greatly
for
a
deep
wound
diligent
and
long
tending
must
not
be
wanting
the
repentance
must
not
fall
short
of
the
offence
take
heed
to
thyself
says
st
basil
that
in
proportion
to
the
fault
thou
admit
also
the
restoration
from
the
remedy
if
so
the
question
follows
which
was
above
contemplated
if
in
consequence
of
death
or
in
the
exercise
of
the
church
discretion
the
is
not
accomplished
in
its
ecclesiastical
shape
how
and
when
will
the
residue
be
exacted
clement
of
alexandria
answers
this
particular
question
very
distinctly
according
to
bishop
kaye
though
not
in
some
other
points
expressing
himself
conformably
to
the
doctrine
afterwards
received
clement
says
that
author
distinguishes
between
sins
committed
before
and
after
baptism
the
former
are
remitted
at
baptism
the
latter
are
purged
by
discipline
the
necessity
of
this
purifying
discipline
is
such
that
if
it
does
not
take
place
in
this
life
it
must
after
death
and
is
then
to
be
effected
by
fire
not
by
a
destructive
but
a
discriminating
fire
pervading
the
soul
which
passes
through
it
there
is
a
celebrated
passage
in
cyprian
on
the
subject
of
the
punishment
of
lapsed
christians
which
certainly
seems
to
express
the
same
doctrine
cyprian
is
arguing
in
favour
of
readmitting
the
lapsed
when
penitent
and
his
argument
seems
to
be
that
it
does
not
follow
that
we
absolve
them
simply
because
we
simply
restore
them
to
the
church
he
writes
thus
to
antonian
is
one
thing
to
stand
for
pardon
another
to
arrive
at
glory
one
to
be
sent
to
prison
in
and
not
to
go
out
till
the
last
farthing
be
paid
another
to
receive
at
once
the
reward
of
faith
and
virtue
one
thing
to
be
tormented
for
sin
in
long
pain
and
so
to
be
cleansed
and
purged
a
long
while
by
fire
diu
another
to
be
washed
from
all
sin
in
martyrdom
one
thing
in
short
to
wait
for
the
lord
sentence
in
the
day
of
judgment
another
at
once
to
be
crowned
by
him
some
understand
this
passage
to
refer
to
the
penitential
discipline
of
the
church
which
was
imposed
on
the
penitent
and
as
far
as
the
context
goes
certainly
no
sense
could
be
more
apposite
yet
the
words
in
themselves
seem
to
go
beyond
any
mere
ecclesiastical
though
virtually
divine
censure
especially
in
and
diu
the
acts
of
the
martyrs
perpetua
and
felicitas
which
are
prior
to
cyprian
confirm
this
interpretation
in
the
course
of
the
narrative
perpetua
prays
for
her
brother
dinocrates
who
had
died
at
the
age
of
seven
and
has
a
vision
of
a
dark
place
and
next
of
a
pool
of
water
which
he
was
not
tall
enough
to
reach
she
goes
on
praying
and
in
a
second
vision
the
water
descended
to
him
and
he
was
able
to
drink
and
went
to
play
as
children
use
then
i
knew
she
says
that
he
was
translated
from
his
place
of
punishment
the
prayers
in
the
eucharistic
service
for
the
faithful
departed
inculcate
at
least
according
to
the
belief
of
the
fourth
century
the
same
doctrine
that
the
sins
of
accepted
and
elect
souls
which
were
not
expiated
here
would
receive
punishment
hereafter
certainly
such
was
cyril
belief
i
know
that
many
say
he
observes
what
is
a
soul
profited
which
departs
from
this
world
either
with
sins
or
without
sins
if
it
be
commemorated
in
the
eucharistic
prayer
now
surely
if
when
a
king
had
banished
certain
who
had
given
him
offence
their
connexions
should
weave
a
crown
and
offer
it
to
him
on
behalf
of
those
under
his
vengeance
would
he
not
grant
a
respite
to
their
punishments
in
the
same
way
we
when
we
offer
to
him
our
supplications
for
those
who
have
fallen
asleep
though
they
be
sinners
weave
no
crown
but
offer
up
christ
sacrificed
for
our
sins
propitiating
our
merciful
god
both
for
them
and
for
ourselves
thus
we
see
how
as
time
went
on
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
was
brought
home
to
the
minds
of
the
faithful
as
a
portion
or
form
of
penance
due
for
sin
and
thus
the
apprehension
of
this
doctrine
and
the
practice
of
infant
baptism
would
grow
into
general
reception
together
cardinal
fisher
gives
another
reason
for
purgatory
being
then
developed
out
of
earlier
points
of
faith
he
says
faith
whether
in
purgatory
or
in
indulgences
was
not
so
necessary
in
the
primitive
church
as
now
for
then
love
so
burned
that
every
one
was
ready
to
meet
death
for
christ
crimes
were
rare
and
such
as
occurred
were
avenged
by
the
great
severity
of
the
canons
an
author
who
quotes
this
passage
analyzes
the
circumstances
and
the
reflections
which
prepared
the
christian
mind
for
the
doctrine
when
it
was
first
insisted
on
and
his
remarks
with
a
few
corrections
may
be
accepted
here
most
men
he
says
to
our
apprehensions
are
too
little
formed
in
religious
habits
either
for
heaven
or
for
hell
yet
there
is
no
middle
state
when
christ
comes
in
judgment
in
consequence
it
is
obvious
to
have
recourse
to
the
interval
before
his
coming
as
a
time
during
which
this
incompleteness
may
be
remedied
as
a
season
not
of
changing
the
spiritual
bent
and
character
of
the
soul
departed
whatever
that
be
for
probation
ends
with
mortal
life
but
of
developing
it
in
a
more
determinate
form
whether
of
good
or
of
evil
again
when
the
mind
once
allows
itself
to
speculate
it
will
discern
in
such
a
provision
a
means
whereby
those
who
not
without
true
faith
at
bottom
yet
have
committed
great
crimes
or
those
who
have
been
carried
off
in
youth
while
still
undecided
or
who
die
after
a
barren
though
not
an
immoral
or
scandalous
life
may
receive
such
chastisement
as
may
prepare
them
for
heaven
and
render
it
consistent
with
god
justice
to
admit
them
thither
again
the
inequality
of
the
sufferings
of
christians
in
this
life
compared
one
with
another
leads
the
mind
to
the
same
speculations
the
intense
suffering
for
instance
which
some
men
undergo
on
their
seeming
as
if
but
an
anticipation
in
their
case
of
what
comes
after
death
upon
others
who
without
greater
claim
on
god
forbearance
live
without
chastisement
and

the
mind
will
inevitably
dwell
upon
such
thoughts
unless
it
has
been
taught
to
subdue
them
by
education
or
by
the
fear
or
the
experience
of
their
dangerousness
various
suppositions
have
accordingly
been
made
as
pure
suppositions
as
mere
specimens
of
the
capabilities
if
one
may
so
speak
of
the
divine
dispensation
as
efforts
of
the
mind
reaching
forward
and
venturing
beyond
its
depth
into
the
abyss
of
the
divine
counsels
if
one
supposition
could
be
hazarded
sufficient
to
solve
the
problem
the
existence
of
ten
thousand
others
is
conceivable
unless
indeed
the
resources
of
god
providence
are
exactly
commensurate
with

discernment
of

religious
men
amid
these
searchings
of
heart
have
naturally
gone
to
scripture
for
relief
to
see
if
the
inspired
word
anywhere
gave
them
any
clue
for
their
inquiries
and
from
what
was
there
found
and
from
the
speculations
of
reason
upon
it
various
notions
have
been
hazarded
at
different
times
for
instance
that
there
is
a
certain
momentary
ordeal
to
be
undergone
by
all
men
after
this
life
more
or
less
severe
according
to
their
spiritual
state
or
that
certain
gross
sins
in
good
men
will
be
thus
visited

their
lighter
failings
and
habitual
imperfections
or
that
the
very
sight
of
divine
perfection
in
the
invisible
world
will
be
in
itself
a
pain
while
it
constitutes
the
purification
of
the
imperfect
but
believing
soul

that
happiness
admitting
of
various
degrees
of
intensity
penitents
late
in
life
may
sink
for
ever
into
a
state
blissful
as
far
as
it
goes

more
or
less
approaching
to
unconsciousness
and
infants
dying
after
baptism
may
be
as
gems
paving
the
courts
of
heaven
or
as
the
living
wheels
of
the
prophet
vision
while
matured
saints
may
excel
in
capacity
of
bliss
as
well
as
in
dignity
the
highest
archangels
now
as
to
the
punishments
and
satisfactions
for
sin
the
texts
to
which
the
minds
of
the
early
christians
seem
to
have
been
principally
drawn
and
from
which
they
ventured
to
argue
in
behalf
of
these
vague
notions
were
these
two
fire
shall
try
every
man
work
and
shall
baptize
you
with
the
holy
ghost
and
with
fire
these
passages
with
which
many
more
were
found
to
accord
directed
their
thoughts
one
way
as
making
mention
of
whatever
was
meant
by
the
word
as
the
instrument
of
trial
and
purification
and
that
at
some
time
between
the
present
time
and
the
judgment
or
at
the
judgment
as
the
doctrine
thus
suggested
by
certain
striking
texts
grew
in
popularity
and
definiteness
and
verged
towards
its
present
roman
form
it
seemed
a
key
to
many
others
great
portions
of
the
books
of
psalms
job
and
the
lamentations
which
express
the
feelings
of
religious
men
under
suffering
would
powerfully
recommend
it
by
the
forcible
and
most
affecting
and
awful
meaning
which
they
received
from
it
when
this
was
once
suggested
all
other
meanings
would
seem
tame
and
inadequate
to
these
may
be
added
various
passages
from
the
prophets
as
that
in
the
beginning
of
the
third
chapter
of
malachi
which
speaks
of
fire
as
the
instrument
of
judgment
and
purification
when
christ
comes
to
visit
his
church
moreover
there
were
other
texts
of
obscure
and
indeterminate
bearing
which
seemed
on
this
hypothesis
to
receive
a
profitable
meaning
such
as
our
lord
words
in
the
sermon
on
the
mount
i
say
unto
thee
thou
shalt
by
no
means
come
out
thence
till
thou
hast
paid
the
uttermost
farthing
and
john
expression
in
the
apocalypse
that
man
in
heaven
nor
in
earth
neither
under
the
earth
was
able
to
open
the
book
when
then
an
answer
had
to
be
made
to
the
question
how
is
sin
to
be
remitted
there
was
an
abundance
of
passages
in
scripture
to
make
easy
to
the
faith
of
the
inquirer
the
definitive
decision
of
the
church
the
doctrine
of
sin
especially
when
realized
in
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
leads
the
inquirer
to
fresh
developments
beyond
itself
its
effect
is
to
convert
a
scripture
statement
which
might
seem
only
of
temporary
application
into
a
universal
and
perpetual
truth
when
paul
and
barnabas
would
confirm
the
souls
of
the
disciples
they
taught
them
that
we
must
through
much
tribulation
enter
into
the
kingdom
of
god
it
is
obvious
what
very
practical
results
would
follow
on
such
an
announcement
in
the
instance
of
those
who
simply
accepted
the
apostolic
decision
and
in
like
manner
a
conviction
that
sin
must
have
its
punishment
here
or
hereafter
and
that
we
all
must
suffer
how
overpowering
will
be
its
effect
what
a
new
light
does
it
cast
on
the
history
of
the
soul
what
a
change
does
it
make
in
our
judgment
of
the
external
world
what
a
reversal
of
our
natural
wishes
and
aims
for
the
future
is
a
doctrine
conceivable
which
would
so
elevate
the
mind
above
this
present
state
and
teach
it
so
successfully
to
dare
difficult
things
and
to
be
reckless
of
danger
and
pain
he
who
believes
that
suffer
he
must
and
that
delayed
punishment
may
be
the
greater
will
be
above
the
world
will
admire
nothing
fear
nothing
desire
nothing
he
has
within
his
breast
a
source
of
greatness
heroism
this
is
the
secret
spring
of
strenuous
efforts
and
persevering
toil
of
the
sacrifice
of
fortune
friends
ease
reputation
happiness
there
is
it
is
true
a
higher
class
of
motives
which
will
be
felt
by
the
saint
who
will
do
from
love
what
all
christians
who
act
acceptably
do
from
faith
and
moreover
the
ordinary
measures
of
charity
which
christians
possess
suffice
for
securing
such
respectable
attention
to
religious
duties
as
the
routine
necessities
of
the
church
require
but
if
we
would
raise
an
army
of
devoted
men
to
resist
the
world
to
oppose
sin
and
error
to
relieve
misery
or
to
propagate
the
truth
we
must
be
provided
with
motives
which
keenly
affect
the
many
christian
love
is
too
rare
a
gift
philanthropy
is
too
weak
a
material
for
the
occasion
nor
is
there
an
influence
to
be
found
to
suit
our
purpose
besides
this
solemn
conviction
which
arises
out
of
the
very
rudiments
of
christian
theology
and
is
taught
by
its
most
ancient
masters
this
sense
of
the
awfulness
of
sin
it
is
in
vain
to
look
out
for
missionaries
for
china
or
africa
or
evangelists
for
our
great
towns
or
christian
attendants
on
the
sick
or
teachers
of
the
ignorant
on
such
a
scale
of
numbers
as
the
need
requires
without
the
doctrine
of
purgatory
for
thus
the
sins
of
youth
are
turned
to
account
by
the
profitable
penance
of
manhood
and
terrors
which
the
philosopher
scorns
in
the
individual
become
the
benefactors
and
earn
the
gratitude
of
nations
monastic
but
there
is
one
form
of
penance
which
has
been
more
prevalent
and
uniform
than
any
other
out
of
which
the
forms
just
noticed
have
grown
or
on
which
they
have
been
engrafted
the
monastic
rule
in
the
first
ages
the
doctrine
of
the
punishments
of
sin
whether
in
this
world
or
in
the
next
was
little
called
for
the
rigid
discipline
of
the
infant
church
was
the
preventive
of
greater
offences
and
its
persecutions
the
penance
of
their
commission
but
when
the
canons
were
relaxed
and
confessorship
ceased
then
some
substitute
was
needed
and
such
was
monachism
being
at
once
a
sort
of
continuation
of
primeval
innocence
and
a
school
of
and
as
it
is
a
great
principle
in
economical
and
political
science
that
everything
should
be
turned
to
account
and
there
should
be
no
waste
so
in
the
instance
of
christianity
the
penitential
observances
of
individuals
which
were
necessarily
on
a
large
scale
as
its
professors
increased
took
the
form
of
works
whether
for
the
defence
of
the
church
or
the
spiritual
and
temporal
good
of
mankind
in
no
aspect
of
the
divine
system
do
we
see
more
striking
developments
than
in
the
successive
fortunes
of
monachism
little
did
the
youth
antony
foresee
when
he
set
off
to
fight
the
evil
one
in
the
wilderness
what
a
sublime
and
various
history
he
was
opening
a
history
which
had
its
first
developments
even
in
his
own
lifetime
he
was
himself
a
hermit
in
the
desert
but
when
others
followed
his
example
he
was
obliged
to
give
them
guidance
and
thus
he
found
himself
by
degrees
at
the
head
of
a
large
family
of
solitaries
five
thousand
of
whom
were
scattered
in
the
district
of
nitria
alone
he
lived
to
see
a
second
stage
in
the
development
the
huts
in
which
they
lived
were
brought
together
sometimes
round
a
church
and
a
sort
of
subordinate
community
or
college
formed
among
certain
individuals
of
their
number
pachomius
was
the
first
who
imposed
a
general
rule
of
discipline
upon
the
brethren
gave
them
a
common
dress
and
set
before
them
the
objects
to
which
the
religious
life
was
dedicated
manual
labour
study
devotion
bodily
mortification
were
now
their
peculiarities
and
the
institution
thus
defined
spread
and
established
itself
through
eastern
and
western
christendom
the
penitential
character
of
monachism
is
not
prominent
in
antony
though
it
is
distinctly
noticed
by
pliny
in
his
description
of
the
essenes
of
the
dead
sea
who
anticipated
the
monastic
life
at
the
rise
of
christianity
in
st
basil
however
it
becomes
a
distinguishing
feature
so
much
so
that
the
monastic
profession
was
made
a
disqualification
for
the
pastoral
office
and
in
theory
involved
an
absolute
separation
from
mankind
though
in
st
basil
as
well
as
antony
disciples
it
performed
the
office
of
resisting
heresy
next
the
monasteries
which
in
their
ecclesiastical
capacity
had
been
at
first
separate
churches
under
a
presbyter
or
abbot
became
schools
for
the
education
of
the
clergy
centuries
passed
and
after
many
extravagant
shapes
of
the
institution
and
much
wildness
and
insubordination
in
its
members
a
new
development
took
place
under
benedict
revising
and
digesting
the
provisions
of
antony
pachomius
and
st
basil
he
bound
together
his
monks
by
a
perpetual
vow
brought
them
into
the
cloister
united
the
separate
convents
into
one
order
and
added
objects
of
an
ecclesiastical
and
civil
nature
to
that
of
personal
edification
of
these
objects
agriculture
seemed
to
benedict
himself
of
first
importance
but
in
a
very
short
time
it
was
superseded
by
study
and
education
and
the
monasteries
of
the
following
centuries
became
the
schools
and
libraries
and
the
monks
the
chroniclers
and
copyists
of
a
dark
period
centuries
later
the
benedictine
order
was
divided
into
separate
congregations
and
propagated
in
separate
monastic
bodies
the
congregation
of
cluni
was
the
most
celebrated
of
the
former
and
of
the
latter
the
hermit
order
of
the
camaldoli
and
the
agricultural
cistercians
both
a
unity
and
an
originality
are
observable
in
the
successive
phases
under
which
monachism
has
shown
itself
and
while
its
developments
bring
it
more
and
more
into
the
ecclesiastical
system
and
subordinate
it
to
the
governing
power
they
are
true
to
their
first
idea
and
spring
fresh
and
fresh
from
the
parent
stock
which
from
time
immemorial
had
thriven
in
syria
and
egypt
the
sheepskin
and
desert
of
antony
did
but
revive
the
mantle
and
the
mountain
of
the
first
carmelite
and
st
basil
penitential
exercises
had
already
been
practised
by
the
therapeut√¶
in
like
manner
the
congregational
principle
which
is
ascribed
to
benedict
had
been
anticipated
by
antony
and
pachomius
and
after
centuries
of
disorder
another
function
of
early
monachism
for
which
there
had
been
little
call
for
centuries
the
defence
of
catholic
truth
was
exercised
with
singular
success
by
the
rival
orders
of
dominicans
and
franciscans
benedict
had
come
as
if
to
preserve
a
principle
of
civilization
and
a
refuge
for
learning
at
a
time
when
the
old
framework
of
society
was
falling
and
new
political
creations
were
taking
their
place
and
when
the
young
intellect
within
them
began
to
stir
and
a
change
of
another
kind
discovered
itself
then
appeared
francis
and
dominic
to
teach
and
chastise
it
and
in
proportion
as
monachism
assumed
this
public
office
so
did
the
principle
of
penance
which
had
been
the
chief
characteristic
of
its
earlier
forms
hold
a
less
prominent
place
the
tertiaries
indeed
or
members
of
the
third
order
of
francis
and
dominic
were
penitents
but
the
friar
himself
instead
of
a
penitent
was
made
a
priest
and
was
allowed
to
quit
cloister
nay
they
assumed
the
character
of
what
may
be
called
an
ecumenical
order
as
being
supported
by
begging
not
by
endowments
and
being
under
the
jurisdiction
not
of
the
local
bishop
but
of
the
holy
see
the
dominicans
too
came
forward
especially
as
a
learned
body
and
as
entrusted
with
the
office
of
preaching
at
a
time
when
the
mind
of
europe
seemed
to
be
developing
into
infidelity
they
filled
the
chairs
at
the
universities
while
the
strength
of
the
franciscans
lay
among
the
lower
orders
at
length
in
the
last
era
of
ecclesiastical
revolution
another
principle
of
early
monachism
which
had
been
but
partially
developed
was
brought
out
into
singular
prominence
in
the
history
of
the
jesuits
obedience

ancient
abbot

service
with
which
he
shall
be
heard
in
prayer
and
shall
stand
with
confidence
by
the
crucified
for
so
the
lord
came
to
the
cross
being
made
obedient
even
unto
death
but
it
was
reserved
for
modern
times
to
furnish
the
perfect
illustration
of
this
virtue
and
to
receive
the
full
blessing
which
follows
it
the
great
society
which
bears
no
earthly
name
still
more
secular
in
its
organization
and
still
more
simply
dependent
on
the
see
of
peter
has
been
still
more
distinguished
than
any
order
before
it
for
the
rule
of
obedience
while
it
has
compensated
the
danger
of
its
free
intercourse
with
the
world
by
its
scientific
adherence
to
devotional
exercises
the
hermitage
the
cloister
the
inquisitor
and
the
friar
were
suited
to
other
states
of
society
with
the
jesuits
as
well
as
with
the
religious
communities
which
are
their
juniors
usefulness
secular
and
religious
literature
education
the
confessional
preaching
the
oversight
of
the
poor
missions
the
care
of
the
sick
have
been
chief
objects
of
attention
great
cities
have
been
the
scene
of
operation
bodily
austerities
and
the
ceremonial
of
devotion
have
been
made
of
but
secondary
importance
yet
it
may
fairly
be
questioned
whether
in
an
intellectual
age
when
freedom
both
of
thought
and
of
action
is
so
dearly
prized
a
greater
penance
can
be
devised
for
the
soldier
of
christ
than
the
absolute
surrender
of
judgment
and
will
to
the
command
of
another

ethical

if
the

supposing

we
may
expect
from
the
force

logic
to
find
instances
of
them
in

and
this
i
conceive
to
be
the
case
the
records
indeed
of
those
times
are
scanty
and
we
have
little
means
of
determining
what
daily
christian
life
then
was
we
know
little
of
the

the

the

at

when
these
professed
developments
were
not
recognized
and
duly
located
in

system
yet
it
appears
even
from
what
remains
that
the
atmosphere
of
the
church
was
as
it
were
charged
with
them
from
the
first
and
delivered
itself
of
them
from
time
to
time
in
this
way
or
that
in
various
places
and
persons
as
occasion
elicited
them
testifying
the
presence
of
a
vast
body
of
thought
within
it
which
one
day
would
take
shape
and
position
and
as
a
chief
specimen
of
what
i
am
pointing
out
i
will
direct
attention
to
a
characteristic
principle
of
christianity
whether
in
the
east
or
in
the
west
which
is
at
present
both
a
special
and
a
subject
of
scoffing
with
protestants
and
of
every
shade
and
colour
i
mean
the
devotions
which
both
greeks
and
latins
show
towards
bones
blood
the
heart
the
hair
bits
of
clothes
scapulars
cords
medals
beads
and
the
like
and
the
miraculous
powers
which
they
often
ascribe
to
them
now
the
principle
from
which
these
beliefs
and
usages
proceed
is
the
doctrine
that
matter
is
susceptible
of
grace
or
capable
of
a
union
with
a
divine
presence
and
influence
this
principle
as
we
shall
see
was
in
the
first
age
both
energetically
manifested
and
variously
developed
and
that
chiefly
in
consequence
of
the
diametrically
opposite
doctrine
of
the
schools
and
the
religions
of
the
day
and
thus
its
exhibition
in
that
primitive
age
becomes
also
an
instance
of
a
statement
often
made
in
controversy
that
the
profession
and
the
developments
of
a
doctrine
are
according
to
the
emergency
of
the
time
and
that
silence
at
a
certain
period
implies
not
that
it
was
not
then
held
but
that
it
was
not
questioned
christianity
began
by
considering
matter
as
a
creature
of
god
and
in
itself
very
good
it
taught
that
matter
as
well
as
spirit
had
become
corrupt
in
the
instance
of
adam
and
it
contemplated
its
recovery
it
taught
that
the
highest
had
taken
a
portion
of
that
corrupt
mass
upon
himself
in
order
to
the
sanctification
of
the
whole
that
as
a
firstfruits
of
his
purpose
he
had
purified
from
all
sin
that
very
portion
of
it
which
he
took
into
his
eternal
person
and
thereunto
had
taken
it
from
a
virgin
womb
which
he
had
filled
with
the
abundance
of
his
spirit
moreover
it
taught
that
during
his
earthly
sojourn
he
had
been
subject
to
the
natural
infirmities
of
man
and
had
suffered
from
those
ills
to
which
flesh
is
heir
it
taught
that
the
highest
had
in
that
flesh
died
on
the
cross
and
that
his
blood
had
an
expiatory
power
moreover
that
he
had
risen
again
in
that
flesh
and
had
carried
that
flesh
with
him
into
heaven
and
that
from
that
flesh
glorified
and
deified
in
him
he
never
would
be
divided
as
a
first
consequence
of
these
awful
doctrines
comes
that
of
the
resurrection
of
the
bodies
of
his
saints
and
of
their
future
glorification
with
him
next
that
of
the
sanctity
of
their
relics
further
that
of
the
merit
of
virginity
and
lastly
that
of
the
prerogatives
of
mary
mother
of
god
all
these
doctrines
are
more
or
less
developed
in
the
period
though
in
very
various
degrees
from
the
nature
of
the
case
and
they
were
all
objects
of
offence
or
of
scorn
to
philosophers
priests
or
populace
of
the
day
with
varieties
of
opinions
which
need
not
be
mentioned
it
was
a
fundamental
doctrine
in
the
schools
whether
greek
or
oriental
that
matter
was
essentially
evil
it
had
not
been
created
by
the
supreme
god
it
was
in
eternal
enmity
with
him
it
was
the
source
of
all
pollution
and
it
was
irreclaimable
such
was
the
doctrine
of
platonist
gnostic
and
manichee
whereas
then
john
had
laid
it
down
that
every
spirit
that
confesseth
not
that
jesus
christ
is
come
in
the
flesh
is
the
spirit
of
antichrist
the
gnostics
obstinately
denied
the
incarnation
and
held
that
christ
was
but
a
phantom
or
had
come
on
the
man
jesus
at
his
baptism
and
left
him
at
his
passion
the
one
great
topic
of
preaching
with
apostles
and
evangelists
was
the
resurrection
of
christ
and
of
all
mankind
after
him
but
when
the
philosophers
of
athens
heard
paul
some
mocked
and
others
contemptuously
put
aside
the
doctrine
the
birth
from
a
virgin
implied
not
only
that
the
body
was
not
intrinsically
evil
but
that
one
state
of
it
was
holier
than
another
and
paul
explained
that
while
marriage
was
good
celibacy
was
better
but
the
gnostics
holding
the
utter
malignity
of
matter
one
and
all
condemned
marriage
as
sinful
and
whether
they
observed
continence
or
not
or
abstained
from
eating
flesh
or
not
maintained
that
all
functions
of
our
animal
nature
were
evil
and
abominable
perish
the
thought
says
manes
that
our
lord
jesus
christ
should
have
descended
through
the
womb
of
a
woman
he
descended
says
marcion
but
without
touching
her
or
taking
aught
from
her
through
her
not
of
her
said
another
it
is
absurd
to
assert
says
a
disciple
of
bardesanes
that
this
flesh
in
which
we
are
imprisoned
shall
rise
again
for
it
is
well
called
a
burden
a
tomb
and
a
chain
they
execrate
the
says
c√¶cilius
speaking
of
christians
as
if
bodies
though
withdrawn
from
the
flames
did
not
all
resolve
into
dust
by
years
whether
beasts
tear
or
sea
swallows
or
earth
covers
or
flame
wastes
according
to
the
old
paganism
both
the
educated
and
vulgar
held
corpses
and
sepulchres
in
aversion
they
quickly
rid
themselves
of
the
remains
even
of
their
friends
thinking
their
presence
a
pollution
and
felt
the
same
terror
even
of
which
assails
the
ignorant
and
superstitious
now
it
is
recorded
of
hannibal
that
on
his
return
to
the
african
coast
from
italy
he
changed
his
to
avoid
a
ruined
sepulchre
may
the
god
who
passes
between
heaven
and
hell
says
apuleius
in
his
present
to
thy
eyes
o
emilian
all
that
haunts
the
night
all
that
alarms
in
all
that
terrifies
in
tombs
george
of
cappadocia
could
not
direct
a
more
bitter
taunt
against
the
alexandrian
pagans
than
to
call
the
temple
of
serapis
a
sepulchre
the
case
had
been
the
same
even
among
the
jews
the
rabbins
taught
that
even
the
corpses
of
holy
men
did
but
serve
to
diffuse
infection
and
defilement
when
deaths
were
judaical
says
the
writer
who
goes
under
the
name
of
st
basil
corpses
were
an
abomination
when
death
is
for
christ
the
relics
of
saints
are
precious
it
was
anciently
said
to
the
priests
and
the
nazarites
any
one
shall
touch
a
corpse
he
shall
be
unclean
till
evening
and
he
shall
wash
his
garment
now
on
the
contrary
if
any
one
shall
touch
a
martyr
bones
by
reason
of
the
grace
dwelling
in
the
body
he
receives
some
participation
of
his
sanctity
nay
christianity
taught
a
reverence
for
the
bodies
even
of
heathen
the
care
of
the
dead
is
one
of
the
praises
which
as
we
have
seen
above
is
extorted
in
their
favour
from
the
emperor
julian
and
it
was
exemplified
during
the
mortality
which
spread
through
the
roman
world
in
the
time
of
cyprian
they
did
good
says
pontius
of
the
christians
of
carthage
in
the
profusion
of
exuberant
works
to
all
and
not
only
to
the
household
of
faith
they
did
somewhat
more
than
is
recorded
of
the
incomparable
benevolence
of
tobias
the
slain
of
the
king
and
the
outcasts
whom
tobias
gathered
together
were
of
his
own
kin
only
far
more
of
course
than
such
general
reverence
was
the
honour
that
they
showed
to
the
bodies
of
the
saints
they
ascribed
virtue
to
their
martyred
tabernacles
and
treasured
as
something
supernatural
their
blood
their
ashes
and
their
bones
when
cyprian
was
beheaded
his
brethren
brought
napkins
to
soak
up
his
blood
only
the
harder
portion
of
the
holy
relics
remained
say
the
acts
of
ignatius
who
was
exposed
to
the
beasts
in
the
amphitheatre
which
were
conveyed
to
antioch
and
deposited
in
linen
bequeathed
by
the
grace
that
was
in
the
martyr
to
that
holy
church
as
a
priceless
treasure
the
jews
attempted
to
deprive
the
brethren
of
polycarp
body
lest
leaving
the
crucified
they
begin
to
worship
him
say
his
acts
ignorant
they
continue
that
we
can
never
leave
christ
and
they
add
we
having
taken
up
his
bones
which
were
more
costly
than
precious
stones
and
refined
more
than
gold
deposited
them
where
was
fitting
and
there
when
we
meet
together
as
we
can
the
lord
will
grant
us
to
celebrate
with
joy
and
gladness
the
birthday
of
his
martyrdom
on
one
occasion
in
palestine
the
imperial
authorities
disinterred
the
bodies
and
cast
them
into
the
sea
lest
as
their
opinion
went
says
eusebius
there
should
be
those
who
in
their
sepulchres
and
monuments
might
think
them
gods
and
treat
them
with
divine
worship
julian
who
had
been
a
christian
and
knew
the
christian
history
more
intimately
than
a
mere
infidel
would
know
it
traces
the
superstition
as
he
considers
it
to
the
very
lifetime
of
john
that
is
as
early
as
there
were
martyrs
to
honour
makes
the
honour
paid
them
contemporaneous
with
the
worship
paid
to
our
lord
and
equally
distinct
and
formal
and
moreover
declares
that
first
it
was
secret
which
for
various
reasons
it
was
likely
to
have
been
neither
paul
he
says
nor
matthew
nor
luke
nor
mark
dared
to
call
jesus
god
but
honest
john
having
perceived
that
a
great
multitude
had
been
caught
by
this
disease
in
many
of
the
greek
and
italian
cities
and
hearing
i
suppose
that
the
monuments
of
peter
and
paul
were
secretly
indeed
but
still
hearing
that
they
were
honoured
first
dared
to
say
it
who
can
feel
fitting
abomination
he
says
elsewhere
you
have
filled
all
places
with
tombs
and
monuments
though
it
has
been
nowhere
told
you
to
tumble
down
at
tombs
or
to
honour
them
if
jesus
said
that
they
were
full
of
uncleanness
why
do
ye
invoke
god
at
them
the
tone
of
faustus
the
manich√¶an
is
the
same
ye
have
turned
he
says
to
augustine
the
idols
of
the
heathen
into
your
martyrs
whom
ye
honour
with
similar
prayers
it
is
remarkable
that
the
attention
of
both
christians
and
their
opponents
turned
from
the
relics
of
the
martyrs
to
their
persons
basilides
at
least
who
was
founder
of
one
of
the
most
impious
gnostic
sects
spoke
of
them
with
disrespect
he
considered
that
their
sufferings
were
the
penalty
of
secret
sins
or
evil
desires
or
transgressions
committed
in
another
body
and
a
sign
of
divine
favour
only
because
they
were
allowed
to
connect
them
with
the
cause
of
christ
on
the
other
hand
it
was
the
doctrine
of
the
church
that
martyrdom
was
meritorious
that
it
had
a
certain
supernatural
efficacy
in
it
and
that
the
blood
of
the
saints
received
from
the
grace
of
the
one
redeemer
a
certain
expiatory
power
martyrdom
stood
in
the
place
of
baptism
where
the
sacrament
had
not
been
administered
it
exempted
the
soul
from
all
preparatory
waiting
and
gained
its
immediate
admittance
into
glory
all
crimes
are
pardoned
for
the
sake
of
this
work
says
tertullian
and
in
proportion
to
the
near
approach
of
the
martyrs
to
their
almighty
judge
was
their
high
dignity
and
power
dionysius
speaks
of
their
reigning
with
christ
origen
even
conjectures
that
as
we
are
redeemed
by
the
precious
blood
of
jesus
so
some
are
redeemed
by
the
precious
blood
of
the
martyrs
cyprian
seems
to
explain
his
meaning
when
he
says
we
believe
that
the
merits
of
martyrs
and
the
works
of
the
just
avail
much
with
the
judge
that
is
for
those
who
were
lapsed
when
after
the
end
of
this
age
and
the
world
christ
people
shall
stand
before
his
accordingly
they
were
considered
to
intercede
for
the
church
militant
in
their
state
of
glory
and
for
individuals
whom
they
had
known
potami√¶na
of
alexandria
in
the
first
years
of
the
third
century
when
taken
out
for
execution
promised
to
obtain
after
her
departure
the
salvation
of
the
officer
who
led
her
out
and
did
appear
to
him
according
to
eusebius
on
the
third
day
and
prophesied
his
own
speedy
martyrdom
and
theodosia
in
palestine
came
to
certain
confessors
who
were
in
bonds
to
request
them
as
eusebius
tells
us
to
remember
her
when
they
came
to
the
lord
presence
tertullian
when
a
montanist
betrays
the
existence
of
the
doctrine
in
the
catholic
body
by
protesting
against
it
virgin
next
to
the
prerogatives
of
bodily
suffering
or
martyrdom
came
in
the
estimation
of
the
early
church
the
prerogatives
of
bodily
as
well
as
moral
purity
or
virginity
another
form
of
the
general
principle
which
i
am
here
illustrating
the
first
reward
says
cyprian
to
the
virgins
is
for
the
martyrs
an
hundredfold
the
second
sixtyfold
is
for
yourselves
their
state
and
its
merit
is
recognized
by
a
of
the
writers
of
whom
athenagoras
distinctly
connects
virginity
with
the
privilege
of
divine
communion
you
will
find
many
of
our
people
he
says
to
the
emperor
marcus
both
men
and
women
grown
old
in
their
single
state
in
hope
thereby
of
a
closer
union
with
god
among
the
numerous
authorities
which
might
be
cited
i
will
confine
myself
to
a
work
elaborate
in
itself
and
important
from
its
author
methodius
was
a
bishop
and
martyr
of
the
latter
years
of
the
period
and
is
celebrated
as
the
most
variously
endowed
divine
of
his
day
his
learning
elegance
in
composition
and
eloquence
are
all
commemorated
the
work
in
question
the
is
a
conference
in
which
ten
virgins
successively
take
part
in
praise
of
the
state
of
life
to
which
they
have
themselves
been
specially
called
i
do
not
wish
to
deny
that
there
are
portions
of
it
which
strangely
grate
upon
the
feelings
of
an
age
which
is
formed
on
principles
of
which
marriage
is
the
centre
but
here
we
are
concerned
with
its
doctrine
of
the
speakers
in
this
colloquy
three
at
least
are
real
persons
prior
to
methodius
time
of
these
thecla
whom
tradition
associates
with
paul
is
one
and
marcella
who
in
the
roman
breviary
is
considered
to
be
martha
servant
and
who
is
said
to
have
been
the
woman
who
exclaimed
blessed
is
the
womb
that
bare
thee
is
described
as
a
still
older
servant
of
christ
the
latter
opens
the
discourse
and
her
subject
is
the
gradual
development
of
the
doctrine
of
virginity
in
the
divine
dispensations
theophila
who
follows
enlarges
on
the
sanctity
of
matrimony
with
which
the
special
glory
of
the
higher
state
does
not
interfere
thalia
discourses
on
the
mystical
union
which
exists
between
christ
and
his
church
and
on
the
seventh
chapter
of
the
first
epistle
to
the
corinthians
theopatra
on
the
merit
of
virginity
thallusa
exhorts
to
a
watchful
guardianship
of
the
gift
agatha

the
necessity
of
other
virtues
and
good
works
in
order
to
the
real
praise
of
their
peculiar
profession
procilla
extols
virginity
as
the
special
instrument
of
becoming
a
spouse
of
christ
thecla
treats
of
it
as
the
great
combatant
in
the
warfare
between
heaven
and
hell
good
and
evil
tysiana
with
reference
to
the

ix
virtue
who
has
been
introduced
as
the
principal
personage
in
the
representation
from
the
first
closes
the
discussion
with
an
exhortation
to
inward
purity
and
they
answer
her
by
an
hymn
to
our
lord
as
the
spouse
of
his
saints
it
is
observable
that
methodius
plainly
speaks
of
the
profession
of
virginity
as
a
vow
i
will
explain
says
one
of
his
speakers
how
we
are
dedicated
to
the
lord
what
is
enacted
in
the
book
of
numbers
vow
a
vow
mightily
shows
what
i
am
insisting
on
at
great
length
that
chastity
is
a
mighty
vow
beyond
all
vows
this
language
is
not
peculiar
to
methodius
among
the
fathers
let
such
as
promise
virginity
and
break
their
profession
be
ranked
among
digamists
says
the
council
of
ancyra

beginning
of

fourth
century

speaks
of
being
married
to
christ
and
marriage
implies
a
vow
he
proceeds
to
him
thou
hast
pledged
thy
ripeness
of
age
and
before
he
had
expressly
spoken
of
the
origen
speaks
of
devoting
one
body
to
god
in
chastity
and
cyprian
of
christ
virgin
dedicated
to
him
and
destined
for
his
sanctity
and
elsewhere
of
members
dedicated
to
christ
and
for
ever
devoted
by
virtuous
chastity
to
the
praise
of
continence
and
eusebius
of
those
who
had
consecrated
themselves
body
and
soul
to
a
pure
and
life
of
saints
and
the
spanish
church
supplies
us
with
an
anticipation
of
the
later
devotions
to
saints
and
angels
the
canons
are
extant
of
a
council
of
illiberis
held
shortly
before
the
council
of
nic√¶a
and
representative
of
course
of
the
doctrine
of
the
third
century
among
these
occurs
the
following
it
is
decreed
that
pictures
ought
not
to
be
in
church
lest
what
is
worshipped
or
adored
be
painted
on
the
walls
now
these
words
are
commonly
taken
to
be
decisive
against
the
use
of
pictures
in
the
spanish
church
at
that
era
let
us
grant
it
let
us
grant
that
the
use
of
all
pictures
is
forbidden
pictures
not
only
of
our
lord
and
sacred
emblems
as
of
the
lamb
and
the
dove
but
pictures
of
angels
and
saints
also
it
is
not
fair
to
restrict
the
words
nor
are
controversialists
found
desirous
of
doing
so
they
take
them
to
include
the
images
of
the
saints
for
keeping
of
pictures
out
of
the
church
the
canon
of
the
eliberine
or
illiberitine
council
held
in
spain
about
the
time
of
constantine
the
great
is
most
plain
says
ussher
he
is
speaking
of
the
representations
of
god
and
of
christ
and
of
angels
and
of
saints
the
council
of
eliberis
is
very
ancient
and
of
great
fame
says
taylor
in
which
it
is
expressly
forbidden
that
what
is
worshipped
should
be
depicted
on
the
walls
and
that
therefore
pictures
ought
not
to
be
in
churches
he
too
is
speaking
of
the
saints
i
repeat
let
us
grant
this
freely
this
inference
then
seems
to
be
undeniable
that
the
spanish
church
considered
the
saints
to
be
in
the
number
of
objects
either
of
worship
or
adoration
for
it
is
of
such
objects
that
the
representations
are
forbidden
the
very
drift
of
the
prohibition
is
this
what
is
in
itself
an
object
of
worship
should
be
worshipped
unless
then
saints
and
angels
were
objects
of
worship
their
pictures
would
have
been
allowed
this
mention
of
angels
leads
me
to
a
memorable
passage
about
the
honour
due
to
them
in
justin
martyr
justin
after
answering
the
charge
of
atheism
as
burton
says
which
was
brought
against
christians
of
his
day
and
observing
that
they
were
punished
for
not
worshipping
evil
demons
which
were
not
really
gods
continues
but
him
god
and
the
son
who
came
from
him
and
taught
us
these
things
and
the
host
of
the
other
good
angels
who
follow
and
resemble
him
and
the
prophetic
spirit
we
worship
and
adore
paying
them
a
reasonable
and
true
honour
and
not
grudging
to
deliver
to
any
one
who
wishes
to
learn
as
we
ourselves
have
been
taught
a
more
express
testimony
to
the
can
not
be
required
nor
is
it
unnatural
in
the
connexion
in
which
it
occurs
considering
justin
has
been
speaking
of
the
heathen
worship
of
demons
and
therefore
would
be
led
without
effort
to
mention
not
only
the
incommunicable
adoration
paid
to
the
one
god
who
will
not
give
his
glory
to
another
but
such
inferior
honour
as
may
be
paid
to
creatures
without
sin
on
the
side
whether
of
giver
or
receiver
nor
is
the
construction
of
the
original
greek
harsher
than
is
found
in
other
authors
nor
need
it
surprise
us
in
one
whose
style
is
not
accurate
that
two
words
should
be
used
in
combination
to
express
worship
and
that
one
should
include
angels
and
that
the
other
should
not
the
following
is
burton
account
of
the
passage
scultetus
a
protestant
divine
of
heidelberg
in
his
theologi√¶
which
appeared
in
gave
a
totally
different
meaning
to
the
passage
and
instead
of
connecting
with
connected
it
with
the
words
would
then
be
rendered
thus
him
and
the
son
who
came
from
him
who
also
gave
us
instructions
concerning
these
things
and
concerning
the
host
of
the
other
good
angels
we
worship
this
interpretation
is
adopted
and
defended
at
some
length
by
bishop
bull
and
by
stephen
le
moyne
and
even
the
benedictine
le
nourry
supposed
justin
to
mean
that
christ
had
taught
us
not
to
worship
the
bad
angels
as
well
as
the
existence
of
good
angels
grabe
in
his
edition
of
apology
which
was
printed
in
adopted
another
interpretation
which
had
been
before
proposed
by
le
moyne
and
by
cave
this
also
connects
with
and
would
require
us
to
render
the
passage
thus
and
the
son
who
came
from
him
who
also
taught
these
things
to
us
and
to
the
host
of
the
other
angels
it
might
be
thought
that
langus
who
published
a
latin
translation
of
justin
in
meant
to
adopt
one
of
these
interpretations
or
at
least
to
connect
with
these
both
of
them
certainly
are
ingenious
and
are
not
perhaps
opposed
to
the
literal
construction
of
the
greek
words
but
i
can
not
say
that
they
are
satisfactory
or
that
i
am
surprised
at
roman
catholic
writers
describing
them
as
forced
and
violent
attempts
to
evade
a
difficulty
if
the
words
enclosed
in
brackets
were
removed
the
whole
passage
would
certainly
contain
a
strong
argument
in
favour
of
the
trinity
but
as
they
now
stand
roman
catholic
writers
will
naturally
quote
them
as
supporting
the
worship
of
angels
there
is
however
this
difficulty
in
such
a
construction
of
the
passage
it
proves
too
much
by
coupling
the
angels
with
the
three
persons
of
the
trinity
as
objects
of
religious
adoration
it
seems
to
go
beyond
even
what
roman
catholics
themselves
would
maintain
concerning
the
worship
of
angels
their
distinction
between
and
would
be
entirely
confounded
and
the
difficulty
felt
by
the
benedictine
editor
appears
to
have
been
as
great
as
his
attempt
to
explain
it
is
unsuccessful
when
he
wrote
as
follows
adversaries
in
vain
object
the
twofold
expression
worship
and
for
the
former
is
applied
to
angels
themselves
regard
being
had
to
the
distinction
between
the
creature
and
the
creator
the
latter
by
no
means
necessarily
includes
the
angels
this
sentence
requires
concessions
which
no
opponent
could
be
expected
to
make
and
if
one
of
the
two
terms
and
may
be
applied
to
angels
it
is
unreasonable
to
contend
that
the
other
must
not
also
perhaps
however
the
passage
may
be
explained
so
as
to
admit
a
distinction
of
this
kind
the
interpretations
of
scultetus
and
grabe
have
not
found
many
advocates
and
upon
the
whole
i
should
be
inclined
to
conclude
that
the
clause
which
relates
to
the
angels
is
connected
particularly
with
the
words
them
a
reasonable
and
true
two
violent
alterations
of
the
text
have
also
been
proposed
one
to
transfer
the
clause
which
creates
the
difficulty
after
the
words
them
the
other
to
substitute
œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑŒ∑Œ≥·Ω∏ŒΩ
for
œÉœÑœÅŒ±œÑ·Ω∏ŒΩ
presently
burton
continues
justin
as
i
observed
is
defending
the
christians
from
the
charge
of
atheism
and
after
saying
that
the
gods
whom
they
refused
to
worship
were
no
gods
but
evil
demons
he
points
out
what
were
the
beings
who
were
worshipped
by
the
christians
he
names
the
true
god
who
is
the
source
of
all
virtue
the
son
who
proceeded
from
him
the
good
and
ministering
spirits
and
the
holy
ghost
to
these
beings
he
says
we
pay
all
the
worship
adoration
and
honour
which
is
due
to
each
of
them
worship
where
worship
is
due
honour
where
honour
is
due
the
christians
were
accused
of
worshipping
no
gods
that
is
of
acknowledging
no
superior
beings
at
all
justin
shows
that
so
far
was
this
from
being
true
that
they
acknowledged
more
than
one
order
of
spiritual
beings
they
offered
divine
worship
to
the
true
god
and
they
also
believed
in
the
existence
of
good
spirits
which
were
entitled
to
honour
and
respect
if
the
reader
will
view
the
passage
as
a
whole
he
will
perhaps
see
that
there
is
nothing
violent
in
thus
restricting
the
words
and
and
to
certain
parts
of
it
respectively
it
may
seem
strange
that
justin
should
mention
the
ministering
spirits
before
the
holy
ghost
but
this
is
a
difficulty
which
presses
upon
the
roman
catholics
as
much
as
upon
ourselves
and
we
may
perhaps
adopt
the
explanation
of
the
bishop
of
lincoln
who
says
have
sometimes
thought
that
in
this
passage
the
is
equivalent
to
the
and
that
justin
had
in
his
mind
the
glorified
state
of
christ
when
he
should
come
to
judge
the
world
surrounded
by
the
host
of
heaven
the
bishop
then
brings
several
passages
from
justin
where
the
son
of
god
is
spoken
of
as
attended
by
a
company
of
angels
and
if
this
idea
was
then
in
justin
mind
it
might
account
for
his
naming
the
ministering
spirits
immediately
after
the
son
of
god
rather
than
after
the
holy
ghost
which
would
have
been
the
natural
and
proper
order
this
passage
of
justin
is
the
more
remarkable
because
it
can
not
be
denied
that
there
was
a
worship
of
the
angels
at
that
day
of
which
paul
speaks
which
was
jewish
and
gnostic
and
utterly
reprobated
by
the
church
of
the
blessed
the
special
prerogatives
of
mary
the
are
intimately
involved
in
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
itself
with
which
these
remarks
began
and
have
already
been
dwelt
upon
above
as
is
well
known
they
were
not
fully
recognized
in
the
catholic
ritual
till
a
late
date
but
they
were
not
a
new
thing
in
the
church
or
strange
to
her
earlier
teachers
justin
iren√¶us
and
others
had
distinctly
laid
it
down
that
she
not
only
had
an
office
but
bore
a
part
and
was
a
voluntary
agent
in
the
actual
process
of
redemption
as
eve
had
been
instrumental
and
responsible
in
adam
fall
they
taught
that
as
the
first
woman
might
have
foiled
the
tempter
and
did
not
so
if
mary
had
been
disobedient
or
unbelieving
on
gabriel
message
the
divine
economy
would
have
been
frustrated
and
certainly
the
parallel
between
the
mother
of
all
living
and
the
mother
of
the
redeemer
may
be
gathered
from
a
comparison
of
the
first
chapters
of
scripture
with
the
last
it
was
noticed
in
a
former
place
that
the
only
passage
where
the
serpent
is
directly
identified
with
the
evil
spirit
occurs
in
the
twelfth
chapter
of
the
revelation
now
it
is
observable
that
the
recognition
when
made
is
found
in
the
course
of
a
vision
of
a
woman
clothed
with
the
sun
and
the
moon
under
her
feet
thus
two
women
are
brought
into
contrast
with
each
other
moreover
as
it
is
said
in
the
apocalypse
the
dragon
was
wroth
with
the
woman
and
went
about
to
make
war
with
the
remnant
of
her
seed
so
is
it
prophesied
in
genesis
i
will
put
enmity
between
thee
and
the
woman
and
between
thy
seed
and
her
seed
he
shall
bruise
thy
head
and
thou
shalt
bruise
his
heel
also
the
enmity
was
to
exist
not
only
between
the
serpent
and
the
seed
of
the
woman
but
between
the
serpent
and
the
woman
herself
and
here
too
there
is
a
correspondence
in
the
apocalyptic
vision
if
then
there
is
reason
for
thinking
that
this
mystery
at
the
close
of
the
scripture
record
answers
to
the
mystery
in
the
beginning
of
it
and
that
the
woman
mentioned
in
both
passages
is
one
and
the
same
then
she
can
be
none
other
than
mary
thus
introduced
prophetically
to
our
notice
immediately
on
the
transgression
of
eve
here
however
we
are
not
so
much
concerned
to
interpret
scripture
as
to
examine
the
fathers
thus
justin
says
eve
being
a
virgin
and
incorrupt
having
conceived
the
word
from
the
serpent
bore
disobedience
and
death
but
mary
the
virgin
receiving
faith
and
joy
when
gabriel
the
angel
evangelized
her
answered
it
unto
me
according
to
thy
word
and
tertullian
says
that
whereas
eve
believed
the
serpent
and
mary
believed
gabriel
the
fault
of
eve
in
believing
mary
by
believing
hath
blotted
out
iren√¶us
speaks
more
explicitly
as
eve
he
says
becoming
disobedient
became
the
cause
of
death
to
herself
and
to
all
mankind
so
mary
too
having
the
predestined
man
and
yet
a
virgin
being
obedient
became
cause
of
salvation
both
to
herself
and
to
all
mankind
this
becomes
the
received
doctrine
in
the
church
one
instance
occurs
in
the
history
of
the
third
century
of
mary
interposition
and
it
is
remarkable
from
the
names
of
the
two
persons
who
were
one
the
subject
the
other
the
historian
of
it
gregory
nyssen
a
native
of
cappadocia
in
the
fourth
century
relates
that
his
bishop
of
surnamed
thaumaturgus
in
the
preceding
century
shortly
before
he
was
called
to
the
priesthood
received
in
a
vision
a
creed
which
is
still
extant
from
the
blessed
virgin
at
the
hands
of
john
the
account
runs
thus
he
was
deeply
pondering
theological
doctrine
which
the
heretics
of
the
day
depraved
in
such
thoughts
says
his
of
nyssa
he
was
passing
the
night
when
one
appeared
as
if
in
human
form
aged
in
appearance
saintly
in
the
fashion
of
his
garments
and
very
venerable
both
in
grace
of
countenance
and
general
mien
following
with
his
eyes
his
extended
hand
he
saw
another
appearance
opposite
to
the
former
in
shape
of
a
woman
but
more
than
human
when
his
eyes
could
not
bear
the
apparition
he
heard
them
conversing
together
on
the
subject
of
his
doubts
and
thereby
not
only
gained
a
true
knowledge
of
the
faith
but
learned
their
names
as
they
addressed
each
other
by
their
respective
appellations
and
thus
he
is
said
to
have
heard
the
person
in
woman
shape
bid
the
evangelist
disclose
to
the
young
man
the
mystery
of
godliness
and
he
answered
that
he
was
ready
to
comply
in
this
matter
with
the
wish
of
mother
of
the
lord
and
enunciated
a
formulary
and
complete
and
so
vanished
gregory
proceeds
to
rehearse
the
creed
thus
given
there
is
one
god
father
of
a
living
word
bull
after
quoting
it
in
his
work
upon
the
nicene
faith
refers
to
this
history
of
its
origin
and
adds
no
one
should
think
it
incredible
that
such
a
providence
should
befall
a
man
whose
whole
life
was
conspicuous
for
revelations
and
miracles
as
all
ecclesiastical
writers
who
have
mentioned
him
and
who
has
not
witness
with
one
voice
it
is
remarkable
that
gregory
nazianzen
relates
an
instance
even
more
pointed
of
mary
intercession
contemporaneous
with
this
appearance
to
thaumaturgus
but
it
is
attended
with
mistake
in
the
narrative
which
weakens
its
cogency
as
an
evidence
of
the
belief
not
indeed
of
the
fourth
century
in
which
gregory
lived
but
of
the
third
he
speaks
of
a
christian
woman
having
recourse
to
the
protection
of
mary
and
obtaining
the
conversion
of
a
heathen
who
had
attempted
to
practise
on
her
by
magical
arts
they
were
both
martyred
in
both
these
instances
the
blessed
virgin
appears
especially
in
that
character
of
patroness
or
paraclete
which
iren√¶us
and
other
fathers
describe
and
which
the
medieval
church
exhibits
a
loving
mother

application
of
the
sixth
note
of
a
true
development
conservative
action
on
its
past
it
is
the
general
pretext
of
heretics
that
they
are
but
serving
and
protecting
christianity
by
their
innovations
and
it
is
their
charge
against
what
by
this
time
we
may
surely
call
the
catholic
church
that
her
successive
definitions
of
doctrine
have
but
overlaid
and
obscured
it
that
is
they
assume
what
we
have
no
wish
to
deny
that
a
true
development
is
that
which
is
conservative
of
its
original
and
a
corruption
is
that
which
tends
to
its
destruction
this
has
already
been
set
down
as
a
sixth
test
discriminative
of
a
development
from
a
corruption
and
must
now
be
applied
to
the
catholic
doctrines
though
this
essay
has
so
far
exceeded
its
proposed
limits
that
both
reader
and
writer
may
well
be
weary
and
may
content
themselves
with
a
brief
consideration
of
the
portions
of
the
subject
which
remain
it
has
been
observed
already
that
a
strict
correspondence
between
the
various
members
of
a
development
and
those
of
the
doctrine
from
which
it
is
derived
is
more
than
we
have
any
right
to
expect
the
bodily
structure
of
a
grown
man
is
not
merely
that
of
a
magnified
boy
he
differs
from
what
he
was
in
his
make
and
proportions
still
manhood
is
the
perfection
of
boyhood
adding
something
of
its
own
yet
keeping
what
it
finds
ut
nihil
novum
says
vincentius
proferatur
in
senibus
quod
non
in
pueris
jam
antea
latitaverit
this
character
of
addition
that
is
of
a
change
which
is
in
one
sense
real
and
perceptible
yet
without
loss
or
reversal
of
what
was
before
but
on
the
contrary
protective
and
confirmative
of
it
in
many
respects
and
in
a
special
way
belongs
to
christianity
section
i
various
instances
if
we
take
the
simplest
and
most
general
view
of
its
history
as
existing
in
an
individual
mind
or
in
the
church
at
large
we
shall
see
in
it
an
instance
of
this
peculiarity
it
is
the
birth
of
something
virtually
new
because
latent
in
what
was
before
thus
we
know
that
no
temper
of
mind
is
acceptable
in
the
divine
presence
without
love
it
is
love
which
makes
christian
fear
differ
from
servile
dread
and
true
faith
differ
from
the
faith
of
devils
yet
in
the
beginning
of
the
religious
life
fear
is
the
prominent
evangelical
grace
and
love
is
but
latent
in
fear
and
has
in
course
of
time
to
be
developed
out
of
what
seems
its
contradictory
then
when
it
is
developed
it
takes
that
prominent
place
which
fear
held
before
yet
protecting
not
superseding
it
love
is
added
not
fear
removed
and
the
mind
is
but
perfected
in
grace
by
what
seems
a
revolution
they
that
sow
in
tears
reap
in
joy
yet
afterwards
still
they
are
sorrowful
though
alway
rejoicing
and
so
was
it
with
the
church
at
large
she
started
with
suffering
which
turned
to
victory
but
when
she
was
set
free
from
the
house
of
her
prison
she
did
not
quit
it
so
much
as
turn
it
into
a
cell
meekness
inherited
the
earth
strength
came
forth
from
weakness
the
poor
made
many
rich
yet
meekness
and
poverty
remained
the
rulers
of
the
world
were
monks
when
they
could
not
be
martyrs
immediately
on
the
overthrow
of
the
heathen
power
two
movements
simultaneously
ran
through
the
world
from
east
to
west
as
quickly
as
the
lightning
in
the
prophecy
a
development
of
worship
and
of
asceticism
hence
while
the
world
first
reproach
in
heathen
times
had
been
that
christianity
was
a
dark
malevolent
magic
its
second
has
been
that
it
is
a
joyous
carnal
paganism
according
to
that
saying
we
have
piped
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
danced
we
have
mourned
unto
you
and
ye
have
not
lamented
for
john
came
neither
eating
nor
drinking
and
they
say
he
hath
a
devil
the
son
of
man
came
eating
and
drinking
and
they
say
behold
a
man
gluttonous
and
a
winebibber
a
friend
of
publicans
and
sinners
yet
our
lord
too
was
a
man
of
sorrows
all
the
while
but
softened
his
austerity
by
his
gracious
gentleness
the
like
characteristic
attends
also
on
the
mystery
of
his
incarnation
he
was
first
god
and
he
became
man
but
eutyches
and
heretics
of
his
school
refused
to
admit
that
he
was
man
lest
they
should
deny
that
he
was
god
in
consequence
the
catholic
fathers
are
frequent
and
unanimous
in
their
asseverations
that
the
word
had
become
flesh
not
to
his
loss
but
by
an
addition
each
nature
is
distinct
but
the
created
nature
lives
in
and
by
the
eternal
non
amittendo
quod
erat
sed
sumendo
quod
non
erat
is
the
church
principle
and
hence
though
the
course
of
development
as
was
observed
in
a
former
chapter
has
been
to
bring
into
prominence
the
divine
aspect
of
our
lord
mediation
this
has
been
attended
by
even
a
more
open
manifestation
of
the
doctrine
of
his
atoning
sufferings
the
passion
of
our
lord
is
one
of
the
most
imperative
and
engrossing
subjects
of
catholic
teaching
it
is
the
great
topic
of
meditations
and
prayers
it
is
brought
into
continual
remembrance
by
the
sign
of
the
cross
it
is
preached
to
the
world
in
the
crucifix
it
is
variously
honoured
by
the
many
houses
of
prayer
and
associations
of
religious
men
and
pious
institutions
and
undertakings
which
in
some
way
or
other
are
placed
under
the
name
and
the
shadow
of
jesus
or
the
saviour
or
the
redeemer
or
his
cross
or
his
passion
or
his
sacred
heart
here
a
singular
development
may
be
mentioned
of
the
doctrine
of
the
cross
which
some
have
thought
so
contrary
to
its
original
meaning
as
to
be
a
manifest
corruption
i
mean
the
introduction
of
the
sign
of
the
meek
jesus
into
the
armies
of
men
and
the
use
of
an
emblem
of
peace
as
a
protection
in
battle
if
light
has
no
communion
with
darkness
or
christ
with
belial
what
has
he
to
do
with
moloch
who
would
not
call
down
fire
on
his
enemies
and
came
not
to
destroy
but
to
save
yet
this
seeming
anomaly
is
but
one
instance
of
a
great
law
which
is
seen
in
developments
generally
that
changes
which
appear
at
first
sight
to
contradict
that
out
of
which
they
grew
are
really
its
protection
or
illustration
our
lord
himself
is
represented
in
the
prophets
as
a
combatant
inflicting
wounds
while
he
received
them
as
coming
from
bozrah
with
dyed
garments
sprinkled
and
red
in
his
apparel
with
the
blood
of
his
enemies
and
whereas
no
war
is
lawful
but
what
is
just
it
surely
beseems
that
they
who
are
engaged
in
so
dreadful
a
commission
as
that
of
taking
away
life
at
the
price
of
their
own
should
at
least
have
the
support
of
his
presence
and
fight
under
the
mystical
influence
of
his
name
who
redeemed
his
elect
as
a
combatant
by
the
blood
of
atonement
with
the
slaughter
of
his
foes
the
sudden
overthrow
of
the
jews
and
the
slow
and
awful
fall
of
the
pagan
empire
and
if
the
wars
of
christian
nations
have
often
been
unjust
this
is
a
reason
against
much
more
than
the
use
of
religious
symbols
by
the
parties
who
engage
in
them
though
the
pretence
of
religion
may
increase
the
sin
the
same
rule
of
development
has
been
observed
in
respect
of
the
doctrine
of
the
blessed
trinity
it
is
the
objection
of
the
school
of
socinus
that
belief
in
the
trinity
is
destructive
of
any
true
maintenance
of
the
divine
unity
however
strongly
the
latter
may
be
professed
but
petavius
as
we
have
seen
sets
it
down
as
one
especial
recommendation
of
the
catholic
doctrine
that
it
subserves
that
original
truth
which
at
first
sight
it
does
but
obscure
and
compromise
this
representation
of
the
consistency
of
the
catholic
system
will
be
found
to
be
true
even
in
respect
of
those
peculiarities
of
it
which
have
been
considered
by
protestants
most
open
to
the
charge
of
corruption
and
innovation
it
is
maintained
for
instance
that
the
veneration
paid
to
images
in
the
catholic
church
directly
contradicts
the
command
of
scripture
and
the
usage
of
the
primitive
ages
as
to
primitive
usage
that
part
of
the
subject
has
been
incidentally
observed
upon
already
here
i
will
make
one
remark
on
the
argument
from
scripture
it
may
be
reasonably
questioned
then
whether
the
commandment
which
stands
second
in
the
protestant
decalogue
on
which
the
prohibition
of
images
is
grounded
was
intended
in
its
letter
for
more
than
temporary
observance
so
far
is
certain
that
though
none
could
surpass
the
later
jews
in
its
literal
observance
nevertheless
this
did
not
save
them
from
the
punishments
attached
to
the
violation
of
it
if
this
be
so
the
literal
observance
is
not
its
true
and
evangelical
import
when
the
generation
to
come
of
your
children
shall
rise
up
after
you
says
their
inspired
lawgiver
and
the
stranger
that
shall
come
from
a
far
land
shall
say
when
they
see
the
plagues
of
that
land
and
its
sicknesses
which
the
lord
hath
laid
upon
it
and
that
the
whole
land
thereof
is
brimstone
and
salt
and
burning
that
it
is
not
sown
nor
beareth
nor
any
grass
groweth
therein
even
all
nations
shall
say
wherefore
hath
the
lord
done
thus
unto
this
land
what
meaneth
the
heat
of
this
great
anger
then
men
shall
say
because
they
have
forsaken
the
covenants
of
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
which
he
made
with
them
when
he
brought
them
forth
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
for
they
went
and
served
other
gods
and
worshipped
them
gods
whom
they
knew
not
and
whom
he
had
not
given
them
now
the
jews
of
our
lord
day
did
not
keep
this
covenant
for
they
incurred
the
penalty
yet
they
kept
the
letter
of
the
commandment
rigidly
and
were
known
among
the
heathen
far
and
wide
for
their
devotion
to
the
lord
god
of
their
fathers
who
brought
them
out
of
the
land
of
egypt
and
for
their
abhorrence
of
the
gods
whom
he
had
not
given
them
if
then
adherence
to
the
letter
was
no
protection
to
the
jews
departure
from
the
letter
may
be
no
guilt
in
christians
it
should
be
observed
moreover
that
there
certainly
is
a
difference
between
the
two
covenants
in
their
respective
view
of
symbols
of
the
almighty
in
the
old
it
was
blasphemy
to
represent
him
under
the
similitude
of
a
calf
that
eateth
hay
in
the
new
the
third
person
of
the
holy
trinity
has
signified
his
presence
by
the
appearance
of
a
dove
and
the
second
person
has
presented
his
sacred
humanity
for
worship
under
the
name
of
the
lamb
it
follows
that
if
the
letter
of
the
decalogue
is
but
partially
binding
on
christians
it
is
as
justifiable
in
setting
it
before
persons
under
instruction
to
omit
such
parts
as
do
not
apply
to
them
as
when
we
quote
passages
from
the
pentateuch
in
sermons
or
lectures
generally
to
pass
over
verses
which
refer
simply
to
the
temporal
promises
or
the
ceremonial
law
a
practice
which
we
allow
without
any
intention
or
appearance
of
dealing
irreverently
with
the
sacred
text
section
ii
devotion
to
the
blessed
virgin
it
has
been
anxiously
asked
whether
the
honours
paid
to
mary
which
have
grown
out
of
devotion
to
her
almighty
lord
and
son
do
not
in
fact
tend
to
weaken
that
devotion
and
whether
from
the
nature
of
the
case
it
is
possible
so
to
exalt
a
creature
without
withdrawing
the
heart
from
the
creator
in
addition
to
what
has
been
said
on
this
subject
in
foregoing
chapters
i
would
here
observe
that
the
question
is
one
of
fact
not
of
presumption
or
conjecture
the
abstract
lawfulness
of
the
honours
paid
to
mary
and
their
distinction
in
theory
from
the
incommunicable
worship
paid
to
god
are
points
which
have
already
been
dwelt
upon
but
here
the
question
turns
upon
their
practicability
or
expedience
which
must
be
determined
by
the
fact
whether
they
are
practicable
and
whether
they
have
been
found
to
be
expedient
here
i
observe
first
that
to
those
who
admit
the
authority
of
the
fathers
of
ephesus
the
question
is
in
no
slight
degree
answered
by
their
sanction
of
the
Œ∏ŒµŒøœÑ·ΩπŒ∫ŒøœÇ
or
mother
of
god
as
a
title
of
mary
and
as
given
in
order
to
protect
the
doctrine
of
the
incarnation
and
to
preserve
the
faith
of
catholics
from
a
specious
humanitarianism
and
if
we
take
a
survey
at
least
of
europe
we
shall
find
that
it
is
not
those
religious
communions
which
are
characterized
by
devotion
towards
the
blessed
virgin
that
have
ceased
to
adore
her
eternal
son
but
those
very
bodies
when
allowed
by
the
law
which
have
renounced
devotion
to
her
the
regard
for
his
glory
which
was
professed
in
that
keen
jealousy
of
her
exaltation
has
not
been
supported
by
the
event
they
who
were
accused
of
worshipping
a
creature
in
his
stead
still
worship
him
their
accusers
who
hoped
to
worship
him
so
purely
they
wherever
obstacles
to
the
development
of
their
principles
have
been
removed
have
ceased
to
worship
him
altogether
next
it
must
be
observed
that
the
tone
of
the
devotion
paid
to
the
blessed
mary
is
altogether
distinct
from
that
which
is
paid
to
her
eternal
son
and
to
the
holy
trinity
as
we
must
certainly
allow
on
inspection
of
the
catholic
services
the
supreme
and
true
worship
paid
to
the
almighty
is
severe
profound
awful
as
well
as
tender
confiding
and
dutiful
christ
is
addressed
as
true
god
while
he
is
true
man
as
our
creator
and
judge
while
he
is
most
loving
gentle
and
gracious
on
the
other
hand
towards
mary
the
language
employed
is
affectionate
and
ardent
as
towards
a
mere
child
of
adam
though
subdued
as
coming
from
her
sinful
kindred
how
different
for
instance
is
the
tone
of
the
from
that
of
the
in
the

we

nor
does
it
avail
to
object
that
in
this
contrast
of
devotional
exercises
the
human
will
supplant
the
divine
from
the
infirmity
of
our
nature
for
i
repeat
the
question
is
one
of
fact
whether
it
has
done
so
and
next
it
must
be
asked
whether
the
character
of
much
of
the
protestant
devotion
towards
our
lord
has
been
that
of
adoration
at
all
and
not
rather
such
as
we
pay
to
an
excellent
human
being
that
is
no
higher
devotion
than
that
which
catholics
pay
to
mary
differing
from
it
however
in
often
being
familiar
rude
and
earthly
carnal
minds
will
ever
create
a
carnal
worship
for
themselves
and
to
forbid
them
the
service
of
the
saints
will
have
no
tendency
to
teach
them
the
worship
of
god
moreover
it
must
be
observed
what
is
very
important
that
great
and
constant
as
is
the
devotion
which
the
catholic
pays
to
the
blessed
mary
it
has
a
special
province
and
has
far
more
connexion
with
the
public
services
and
the
festive
aspect
of
christianity
and
with
certain
extraordinary
offices
which
she
holds
than
with
what
is
strictly
personal
and
primary
in
religion
two
instances
will
serve
in
illustration
of
this
and
they
are
but
samples
of
many
others
for
example
ignatius
spiritual
exercises
are
among
the
most
approved
methods
of
devotion
in
the
modern
catholic
church
they
proceed
from
one
of
the
most
celebrated
of
her
saints
and
have
the
praise
of
popes
and
of
the
most
eminent
masters
of
the
spiritual
life
a
bull
of
paul
the
third
approves
praises
and
sanctions
all
and
everything
contained
in
them
indulgences
are
granted
to
the
performance
of
them
by
the
same
pope
by
alexander
the
seventh
and
by
benedict
the
fourteenth
carlo
borromeo
declared
that
he
learned
more
from
them
than
from
all
other
books
together
francis
de
sales
calls
them
a
holy
method
of
reformation
and
they
are
the
model
on
which
all
the
extraordinary
devotions
of
religious
men
or
bodies
and
the
course
of
missions
are
conducted
if
there
is
a
document
which
is
the
authoritative
exponent
of
the
inward
communion
of
the
members
of
the
modern
catholic
church
with
their
god
and
saviour
it
is
this
work
the
exercises
are
directed
to
the
removal
of
obstacles
in
the
way
of
the
soul
receiving
and
profiting
by
the
gifts
of
god
they
undertake
to
effect
this
in
three
ways
by
removing
all
objects
of
this
world
and
as
it
were
bringing
the
soul
into
the
solitude
where
god
may
speak
to
its
heart
next
by
setting
before
it
the
ultimate
end
of
man
and
its
own
deviations
from
it
the
beauty
of
holiness
and
the
pattern
of
christ
and
lastly
by
giving
rules
for
its
correction
they
consist
of
a
course
of
prayers
meditations
and
the
like
which
in
its
complete
extent
lasts
thirty
days
and
these
are
divided
into
three
stages
the
in
which
sin
is
the
main
subject
of
consideration
the
which
is
devoted
to
the
contemplation
of
our
lord
passion
involving
the
process
of
the
determination
of
our
calling
and
the
in
which
we
proceed
to
the
contemplation
of
our
lord
resurrection
and
ascension
no
more
need
be
added
in
order
to
introduce
the
remark
for
which
i
have
referred
to
these
exercises
viz
that
in
a
work
so
highly
sanctioned
so
widely
received
so
intimately
bearing
upon
the
most
sacred
points
of
personal
religion
very
slight
mention
occurs
of
devotion
to
the
blessed
virgin
mother
of
god
there
is
one
mention
of
her
in
the
rule
given
for
the
first
prelude
or
preparation
in
which
the
person
meditating
is
directed
to
consider
as
before
him
a
church
or
other
place
with
christ
in
it
mary
and
whatever
else
is
suitable
to
the
subject
of
meditation
another
is
in
the
third
exercise
in
which
one
of
the
three
addresses
is
made
to
our
lady
christ
mother
requesting
earnestly
her
intercession
with
her
son
to
which
is
to
be
added
the
ave
mary
in
the
beginning
of
the
second
week
there
is
a
form
of
offering
ourselves
to
god
in
the
presence
of
his
infinite
goodness
and
with
the
witness
of
his
glorious
virgin
mother
mary
and
the
whole
host
of
heaven
at
the
end
of
the
meditation
upon
the
angel
gabriel
mission
to
mary
there
is
an
address
to
each
divine
person
to
the
word
incarnate
and
to
his
mother
in
the
meditation
upon
the
two
standards
there
is
an
address
prescribed
to
mary
to
implore
grace
from
her
son
through
her
with
an
ave
mary
after
it
in
the
beginning
of
the
third
week
one
address
is
prescribed
to
christ
or
three
if
devotion
incites
to
mother
son
and
father
in
the
description
given
of
three
different
modes
of
prayer
we
are
told
if
we
would
imitate
the
blessed
mary
we
must
recommend
ourselves
to
her
as
having
power
with
her
son
and
presently
the
ave
mary
and
other
forms
are
prescribed
as
is
usual
after
all
prayers
and
this
is
pretty
much
the
whole
of
the
devotion
if
it
may
so
be
called
which
is
recommended
towards
mary
in
the
course
of
so
many
apparently
as
a
hundred
and
fifty
meditations
and
those
chiefly
on
the
events
in
our
lord
earthly
history
as
recorded
in
scripture
it
would
seem
then
that
whatever
be
the
influence
of
the
doctrines
connected
with
the
blessed
virgin
and
the
saints
in
the
catholic
church
at
least
they
do
not
impede
or
obscure
the
freest
exercise
and
the
fullest
manifestation
of
the
devotional
feelings
towards
god
and
christ
the
other
instance
which
i
give
in
illustration
is
of
a
different
kind
but
is
suitable
to
mention
about
forty
little
books
have
come
into
my
possession
which
are
in
circulation
among
the
laity
at
rome
and
answer
to
the
smaller
publications
of
the
christian
knowledge
society
among
ourselves
they
have
been
taken
almost
at
hazard
from
a
number
of
such
works
and
are
of
various
lengths
some
running
to
as
many
as
two
or
three
hundred
pages
others
consisting
of
scarce
a
dozen
they
may
be
divided
into
three
classes
a
third
part
consists
of
books
on
practical
subjects
another
third
is
upon
the
incarnation
and
passion
and
of
the
rest
a
portion
is
upon
the
sacraments
especially
the
holy
eucharist
with
two
or
three
for
the
use
of
missions
but
the
greater
part
is
about
the
blessed
virgin
as
to
the
class
on
practical
subjects
they
are
on
such
as
the
following
la
consolazione
degl
infermi
pensieri
di

sul

moderno
aperto
il

other
maxims
by
francis
de
sales
for
every
day
in
the
year
pratica
per
ben
confessarsi
e
communicarsi
and
the
like
the
titles
of
the
second
class
on
the
incarnation
and
passion
are
such
as
gesu
dalla
croce
al
cuore
del
peccatore
novena
del
ss
natale
di
associazione
pel
culto
perpetuo
del
divin
cuore
compendio
della
passione
in
the
third
are
il
mese
eucaristico
il
divoto
di
maria
feasts
of
the
blessed
virgin
these
books
in
all
three
divisions
are
as
even
the
titles
of
some
of
them
show
in
great
measure
made
up
of
meditations
such
are
the
breve
e
pie
meditazioni
of
crasset
the
meditazioni
per
ciascun
giorno
del
mese
sulla
passione
the
meditazioni
per
eucaristica
now
of
these
it
may
be
said
generally
that
in
the
body
of
the
meditation
mary
is
hardly
mentioned
at
all
for
instance
in
the
meditations
on
the
passion
a
book
used
for
distribution
through
two
hundred
and
pages
mary
is
not
once
named
in
the
prayers
for
mass
which
are
added
she
is
introduced
at
the
confiteor
thus
i
pray
the
virgin
the
angels
the
apostles
and
all
the
saints
of
heaven
to
intercede
and
in
the
preparation
for
penance
she
is
once
addressed
after
our
lord
as
the
refuge
of
sinners
with
the
saints
and
guardian
angel
and
at
the
end
of
the
exercise
there
is
a
similar
prayer
of
four
lines
for
the
intercession
of
mary
angels
and
saints
of
heaven
in
the
exercise
for
communion
in
a
prayer
to
our
lord
my
only
and
infinite
good
my
treasure
my
life
my
paradise
my
all
the
merits
of
the
saints
are
mentioned
especially
of
st
mary
she
is
also
mentioned
with
angels
and
saints
at
the
termination
in
a
collection
of
spiritual
lauds
for
missions
of
hymns
we
find
as
many
as
eleven
addressed
to
mary
or
relating
to
her
among
which
are
translations
of
the
maris
and
the
and
the
and
one
is
on
the
sinner
reliance
on
mary
five
however
which
are
upon
repentance
are
entirely
engaged
upon
the
subjects
of
our
lord
and
sin
with
the
exception
of
an
address
to
mary
at
the
end
of
two
of
them
seven
others
upon
sin
the
crucifixion
and
the
four
last
things
do
not
mention
the
blessed
virgin
name
to
the
manual
for
the
perpetual
adoration
of
the
divine
heart
of
jesus
there
is
appended
one
chapter
on
the
immaculate
conception
one
of
the
most
important
of
these
books
is
the
french
which
seems
a
favourite
since
there
are
two
translations
of
it
one
of
them
being
the
fifteenth
edition
and
it
is
used
for
distribution
in
missions
in
these
reflections
there
is
scarcely
a
word
said
of
mary
at
the
end
there
is
a
method
of
reciting
the
crown
of
the
seven
dolours
of
the
virgin
mary
which
contains
seven
prayers
to
her
and
the
one
of
the
longest
in
the
whole
collection
is
a
tract
consisting
principally
of
meditations
on
the
holy
communion
under
the
title
of
the
eucharistic
month
as
already
mentioned
in
these
preparations
aspirations
mary
is
but
once
mentioned
and
that
in
a
prayer
addressed
to
our
lord
o
my
sweetest
brother
it
says
with
an
allusion
to
the
canticles
who
being
made
man
for
my
salvation
hast
sucked
the
milk
from
the
virginal
breast
of
her
who
is
my
mother
by
grace
in
a
small
instruction
given
to
children
on
their
first
communion
there
are
the
following
questions
and
answers
is
our
lady
in
the
host
no
are
the
angels
and
the
saints
no
why
not
because
they
have
no
place
there
now
coming
to
those
in
the
third
class
which
directly
relate
to
the
blessed
mary
such
as
esercizio
ad
onore
dell
addolorato
cuore
di
maria
novena
di
preparazione
alla
festa
dell
assunzione
li
quindici
misteri
del
santo
rosario
the
principal
is
father
il
divoto
di
maria
which
requires
a
distinct
notice
it
is
far
from
the
intention
of
these
remarks
to
deny
the
high
place
which
the
holy
virgin
holds
in
the
devotion
of
catholics
i
am
but
bringing
evidence
of
its
not
interfering
with
that
incommunicable
and
awful
relation
which
exists
between
the
creature
and
the
creator
and
if
the
foregoing
instances
show
as
far
as
they
go
that
that
relation
is
preserved
inviolate
in
such
honours
as
are
paid
to
mary
so
will
this
treatise
throw
light
upon
the
by
which
the
distinction
is
preserved
between
the
worship
of
god
and
the
honour
of
an
exalted
creature
and
that
in
singular
accordance
with
the
remarks
made
in
the
foregoing
section
this
work
of
segneri
is
written
against
persons
who
continue
in
sins
under
pretence
of
their
devotion
to
mary
and
in
consequence
he
is
led
to
draw
out
the
idea
which
good
catholics
have
of
her
the
idea
is
this
that
she
is
absolutely
the
first
of
created
beings
thus
the
treatise
says
that
god
might
have
easily
made
a
more
beautiful
firmament
and
a
greener
earth
but
it
was
not
possible
to
make
a
higher
mother
than
the
virgin
mary
and
in
her
formation
there
has
been
conferred
on
mere
creatures
all
the
glory
of
which
they
are
capable
remaining
mere
creatures
and
as
containing
all
created
perfection
she
has
all
those
attributes
which
as
was
noticed
above
the
arians
and
other
heretics
applied
to
our
lord
and
which
the
church
denied
of
him
as
infinitely
below
his
supreme
majesty
thus
she
is
the
created
idea
in
the
making
of
the
world
which
as
being
a
more
exact
copy
of
the
incarnate
idea
than
was
elsewhere
to
be
found
was
used
as
the
original
of
the
rest
of
the
creation
to
her
are
applied
the
words
ego
primogenita
prodivi
ex
ore
altissimi
because
she
was
predestinated
in
the
eternal
mind
coevally
with
the
incarnation
of
her
divine
son
but
to
him
alone
the
title
of
wisdom
incarnate
is
reserved
again
christ
is
the
by
nature
the
virgin
in
a
less
sublime
order
viz
that
of
adoption
again
if
omnipotence
is
ascribed
to
her
it
is
a
participated
omnipotence
as
she
and
all
saints
have
a
participated
sonship
divinity
glory
holiness
and
worship
and
is
explained
by
the
words
quod
deus
imperio
tu
prece
virgo
potes
again
a
special
office
is
assigned
to
the
blessed
virgin
that
is
special
as
compared
with
all
other
saints
but
it
is
marked
off
with
the
utmost
precision
from
that
assigned
to
our
lord
thus
she
is
said
to
have
been
made
the
arbitress
of
every
coming
from
mercy
because
she
is
the
mother
of
god
the
salvation
of
mankind
is
said
to
be
given
to
her
prayers
but
it
is
due
only
to
the
blood
of
the
redeemer
merit
is
ascribed
to
christ
and
prayer
to
mary
the
whole
may
be
expressed
in
the
words
spes
mea
jesus
et
post
jesum
virgo
maria
amen
again
a
distinct
is
assigned
to
mary
but
the
reason
of
it
is
said
to
be
the
transcendent
dignity
of
her
son
a
particular
is
due
to
the
virgin
beyond
comparison
greater
than
that
given
to
any
other
saint
because
her
dignity
belongs
to
another
order
namely
to
one
which
in
some
sense
belongs
to
the
order
of
the
hypostatic
union
itself
and
is
necessarily
connected
with
it
and
her
being
the
mother
of
god
is
the
source
of
all
the
extraordinary
honours
due
to
mary
it
is
remarkable
that
the
monstra
te
esse
matrem
is
explained
as
show
thyself
to
be
mother
an
interpretation
which
i
think
i
have
found
elsewhere
in
these
tracts
and
also
in
a
book
commonly
used
in
religious
houses
called
the
journal

prove
the

what
these

teach
concerning
the
prerogatives
of
the

virgin
but
to
show
that
that
teaching
is
not
such
as
to
obscure
the
divine
glory
of
her
son
we
must
ask
for
clearer
evidence
before
we
are
able
to
admit
so
grave
a

may

application
of
the
seventh
note
of
a
true
development
chronic
vigour
we
have
arrived
at
length
at
the
seventh
and
last
test
which
was
laid
down
when
we
started
for
distinguishing
the
true
development
of
an
idea
from
its
corruptions
and
perversions
it
is
this
a
corruption
if
vigorous
is
of
brief
duration
runs
itself
out
quickly
and
ends
in
death
on
the
other
hand
if
it
lasts
it
fails
in
vigour
and
passes
into
a
decay
this
general
law
gives
us
additional
assistance
in
determining
the
character
of
the
developments
of
christianity
commonly
called
catholic
when
we
consider
the
succession
of
ages
during
which
the
catholic
system
has
endured
the
severity
of
the
trials
it
has
undergone
the
sudden
and
wonderful
changes
without
and
within
which
have
befallen
it
the
incessant
mental
activity
and
the
intellectual
gifts
of
its
maintainers
the
enthusiasm
which
it
has
kindled
the
fury
of
the
controversies
which
have
been
carried
on
among
its
professors
the
impetuosity
of
the
assaults
made
upon
it
the
responsibilities
to
which
it
has
been
committed
by
the
continuous
development
of
its
dogmas
it
is
quite
inconceivable
that
it
should
not
have
been
broken
up
and
lost
were
it
a
corruption
of
christianity
yet
it
is
still
living
if
there
be
a
living
religion
or
philosophy
in
the
world
vigorous
energetic
persuasive
progressive
acquirit
it
grows
and
is
not
overgrown
it
spreads
out
yet
is
not
enfeebled
it
is
ever
germinating
yet
ever
consistent
with
itself
corruptions
indeed
are
to
be
found
which
sleep
and
are
suspended
and
these
as
i
have
said
are
usually
called
decays
such
is
not
the
case
with
catholicity
it
does
not
sleep
it
is
not
stationary
even
now
and
that
its
long
series
of
developments
should
be
corruptions
would
be
an
instance
of
sustained
error
so
novel
so
unaccountable
so
preternatural
as
to
be
little
short
of
a
miracle
and
to
rival
those
manifestations
of
divine
power
which
constitute
the
evidence
of
christianity
we
sometimes
view
with
surprise
and
awe
the
degree
of
pain
and
disarrangement
which
the
human
frame
can
undergo
without
succumbing
yet
at
length
there
comes
an
end
fevers
have
their
crisis
fatal
or
favourable
but
this
corruption
of
a
thousand
years
if
corruption
it
be
has
ever
been
growing
nearer
death
yet
never
reaching
it
and
has
been
strengthened
not
debilitated
by
its
excesses
for
instance
when
the
empire
was
converted
multitudes
as
is
very
plain
came
into
the
church
on
but
partially
religious
motives
and
with
habits
and
opinions
infected
with
the
false
worships
which
they
had
professedly
abandoned
history
shows
us
what
anxiety
and
effort
it
cost
her
rulers
to
keep
paganism
out
of
her
pale
to
this
tendency
must
be
added
the
hazard
which
attended
on
the
development
of
the
catholic
ritual
such
as
the
honours
publicly
assigned
to
saints
and
martyrs
the
formal
veneration
of
their
relics
and
the
usages
and
observances
which
followed
what
was
to
hinder
the
rise
of
a
sort
of
refined
pantheism
and
the
overthrow
of
dogmatism
with
the
multiplication
of
heavenly
intercessors
and
patrons
if
what
is
called
in
reproach
resembled
the
polytheism
which
it
supplanted
or
was
a
corruption
how
did
dogmatism
survive
dogmatism
is
a
profession
of
its
own
reality
as
contrasted
with
other
systems
but
polytheists
are
liberals
and
hold
that
one
religion
is
as
good
as
another
yet
the
theological
system
was
developing
and
strengthening
as
well
as
the
monastic
rule
which
is
intensely
all
the
while
the
ritual
was
assimilating
itself
as
protestants
say
to
the
paganism
of
former
ages
nor
was
the
development
of
dogmatic
theology
which
was
then
taking
place
a
silent
and
spontaneous
process
it
was
wrought
out
and
carried
through
under
the
fiercest
controversies
and
amid
the
most
fearful
risks
the
catholic
faith
was
placed
in
a
succession
of
perils
and
rocked
to
and
fro
like
a
vessel
at
sea
large
portions
of
christendom
were
one
after
another
in
heresy
or
in
schism
the
leading
churches
and
the
most
authoritative
schools
fell
from
time
to
time
into
serious
error
three
popes
liberius
vigilius
honorius
have
left
to
posterity
the
burden
of
their
defence
but
these
disorders
were
no
interruption
to
the
sustained
and
steady
march
of
the
sacred
science
from
implicit
belief
to
formal
statement
the
series
of
ecclesiastical
decisions
in
which
its
progress
was
ever
and
anon
signified
alternate
between
the
one
and
the
other
side
of
the
theological
dogma
especially
in
question
as
if
fashioning
it
into
shape
by
opposite
strokes
the
controversy
began
in
apollinaris
who
confused
or
denied
the
two
natures
in
christ
and
was
condemned
by
pope
damasus
a
reaction
followed
and
theodore
of
mopsuestia
suggested
by
his
teaching
the
doctrine
of
two
persons
after
nestorius
had
brought
that
heresy
into
public
view
and
had
incurred
in
consequence
the
anathema
of
the
third
ecumenical
council
the
current
of
controversy
again
shifted
its
direction
for
eutyches
appeared
maintained
the
one
nature
and
was
condemned
at
chalcedon
something
however
was
still
wanting
to
the
overthrow
of
the
nestorian
doctrine
of
two
persons
and
the
fifth
council
was
formally
directed
against
the
writings
of
theodore
and
his
party
then
followed
the
monothelite
heresy
which
was
a
revival
of
the
eutychian
or
monophysite
and
was
condemned
in
the
sixth
lastly
nestorianism
once
more
showed
itself
in
the
adoptionists
of
spain
and
gave
occasion
to
the
great
council
of
frankfort
any
one
false
step
would
have
thrown
the
whole
theory
of
the
doctrine
into
irretrievable
confusion
but
it
was
as
if
some
one
individual
and
perspicacious
intellect
to
speak
humanly
ruled
the
theological
discussion
from
first
to
last
that
in
the
long
course
of
centuries
and
in
spite
of
the
failure
in
points
of
detail
of
the
most
gifted
fathers
and
saints
the
church
thus
wrought
out
the
one
and
only
consistent
theory
which
can
be
taken
on
the
great
doctrine
in
dispute
proves
how
clear
simple
and
exact
her
vision
of
that
doctrine
was
but
it
proves
more
than
this
is
it
not
utterly
incredible
that
with
this
thorough
comprehension
of
so
great
a
mystery
as
far
as
the
human
mind
can
know
it
she
should
be
at
that
very
time
in
the
commission
of
the
grossest
errors
in
religious
worship
and
should
be
hiding
the
god
and
mediator
whose
incarnation
she
contemplated
with
so
clear
an
intellect
behind
a
crowd
of
idols
the
integrity
of
the
catholic
developments
is
still
more
evident
when
they
are
viewed
in
contrast
with
the
history
of
other
doctrinal
systems
philosophies
and
religions
of
the
world
have
each
its
day
and
are
parts
of
a
succession
they
supplant
and
are
in
turn
supplanted
but
the
catholic
religion
alone
has
had
no
limits
it
alone
has
ever
been
greater
than
the
emergence
and
can
do
what
others
can
not
do
if
it
were
a
falsehood
or
a
corruption
like
the
systems
of
men
it
would
be
weak
as
they
are
whereas
it
is
able
even
to
impart
to
them
a
strength
which
they
have
not
and
it
uses
them
for
its
own
purposes
and
locates
them
in
its
own
territory
the
church
can
extract
good
from
evil
or
at
least
gets
no
harm
from
it
she
inherits
the
promise
made
to
the
disciples
that
they
should
take
up
serpents
and
if
they
drank
any
deadly
thing
it
should
not
hurt
them
when
evil
has
clung
to
her
and
the
barbarian
people
have
looked
on
with
curiosity
or
in
malice
till
she
should
have
swollen
or
fallen
down
suddenly
she
has
shaken
the
venomous
beast
into
the
fire
and
felt
no
harm
eusebius
has
set
before
us
this
attribute
of
catholicism
in
a
passage
in
his
history
these
attempts
he
says
speaking
of
the
acts
of
the
enemy
did
not
long
avail
him
truth
ever
consolidating
itself
and
as
time
goes
on
shining
into
broader
day
for
while
the
devices
of
adversaries
were
extinguished
at
once
undone
by
their
very
impetuosity
one
heresy
after
another
presenting
its
own
novelty
the
former
specimens
ever
dissolving
and
wasting
variously
in
manifold
and
multiform
shapes
the
brightness
of
the
catholic
and
only
true
church
went
forward
increasing
and
enlarging
yet
ever
in
the
same
things
and
in
the
same
way
beaming
on
the
whole
race
of
greeks
and
barbarians
with
the
awfulness
and
simplicity
and
nobleness
and
sobriety
and
purity
of
its
divine
polity
and
philosophy
thus
the
calumny
against
our
whole
creed
died
with
its
day
and
there
continued
alone
our
discipline
sovereign
among
all
and
acknowledged
to
be
in
awfulness
sobriety
and
divine
and
philosophical
doctrines
so
that
no
one
of
this
day
dares
to
cast
any
base
reproach
upon
our
faith
nor
any
calumny
such
as
it
was
once
usual
for
our
enemies
to
use
the
psalmist
says
we
went
through
fire
and
water
nor
is
it
possible
to
imagine
trials
fiercer
or
more
various
than
those
from
which
catholicism
has
come
forth
uninjured
as
out
of
the
egyptian
sea
or
the
babylonian
furnace
first
of
all
were
the
bitter
persecutions
of
the
pagan
empire
in
the
early
centuries
then
its
sudden
conversion
the
liberty
of
christian
worship
the
development
of
the
and
the
reception
of
monachism
into
the
ecclesiastical
system
then
came
the
irruption
of
the
barbarians
and
the
occupation
by
them
of
the
from
the
north
and
by
the
saracens
from
the
south
meanwhile
the
anxious
and
protracted
controversy
concerning
the
incarnation
hung
like
some
terrible
disease
upon
the
faith
of
the
church
then
came
the
time
of
thick
darkness
and
afterwards
two
great
struggles
one
with
the
material
power
the
other
with
the
intellect
of
the
world
terminating
in
the
ecclesiastical
monarchy
and
in
the
theology
of
the
schools
and
lastly
came
the
great
changes
consequent
upon
the
controversies
of
the
sixteenth
century
is
it
conceivable
that
any
one
of
those
heresies
with
which
ecclesiastical
history
abounds
should
have
gone
through
a
hundredth
part
of
these
trials
yet
have
come
out
of
them
so
nearly
what
it
was
before
as
catholicism
has
done
could
such
a
theology
as
arianism
have
lasted
through
the
scholastic
contest
or
montanism
have
endured
to
possess
the
world
without
coming
to
a
crisis
and
failing
or
could
the
imbecility
of
the
manichean
system
as
a
religion
have
escaped
exposure
had
it
been
brought
into
conflict
with
the
barbarians
of
the
empire
or
the
feudal
system
a
similar
contrast
discovers
itself
in
the
respective
effects
and
fortunes
of
certain
influential
principles
or
usages
which
have
both
been
introduced
into
the
catholic
system
and
are
seen
in
operation
elsewhere
when
a
system
really
is
corrupt
powerful
agents
when
applied
to
it
do
but
develope
that
corruption
and
bring
it
the
more
speedily
to
an
end
they
stimulate
it
preternaturally
it
puts
forth
its
strength
and
dies
in
some
memorable
act
very
different
has
been
the
history
of
catholicism
when
it
has
committed
itself
to
such
formidable
influences
it
has
borne
and
can
bear
principles
or
doctrines
which
in
other
systems
of
religion
quickly
degenerate
into
fanaticism
or
infidelity
this
might
be
shown
at
great
length
in
the
history
of
the
aristotelic
philosophy
within
and
without
the
church
or
in
the
history
of
monachism
or
of
mysticism
not
that
there
has
not
been
at
first
a
conflict
between
these
powerful
and
unruly
elements
and
the
divine
system
into
which
they
were
entering
but
that
it
ended
in
the
victory
of
catholicism
the
theology
of
thomas
nay
of
the
church
of
his
period
is
built
on
that
very
aristotelism
which
the
early
fathers
denounce
as
the
source
of
all
misbelief
and
in
particular
of
the
arian
and
monophysite
heresies
the
exercises
of
asceticism
which
are
so
graceful
in
antony
so
touching
in
st
basil
and
so
awful
in
germanus
do
but
become
a
melancholy
and
gloomy
superstition
even
in
the
most
pious
persons
who
are
cut
off
from
catholic
communion
and
while
the
highest
devotion
in
the
church
is
the
mystical
and
contemplation
has
been
the
token
of
the
most
singularly
favoured
saints
we
need
not
look
deeply
into
the
history
of
modern
sects
for
evidence
of
the
excesses
in
conduct
or
the
errors
in
doctrine
to
which
mystics
have
been
commonly
led
who
have
boasted
of
their
possession
of
reformed
truth
and
have
rejected
what
they
called
the
corruptions
of
catholicism
it
is
true
there
have
been
seasons
when
from
the
operation
of
external
or
internal
causes
the
church
has
been
thrown
into
what
was
almost
a
state
of
but
her
wonderful
revivals
while
the
world
was
triumphing
over
her
is
a
further
evidence
of
the
absence
of
corruption
in
the
system
of
doctrine
and
worship
into
which
she
has
developed
if
corruption
be
an
incipient
disorganization
surely
an
abrupt
and
absolute
recurrence
to
the
former
state
of
vigour
after
an
interval
is
even
less
conceivable
than
a
corruption
that
is
permanent
now
this
is
the
case
with
the
revivals
i
speak
of
after
violent
exertion
men
are
exhausted
and
fall
asleep
they
awake
the
same
as
before
refreshed
by
the
temporary
cessation
of
their
activity
and
such
has
been
the
slumber
and
such
the
restoration
of
the
church
she
pauses
in
her
course
and
almost
suspends
her
functions
she
rises
again
and
she
is
herself
once
more
all
things
are
in
their
place
and
ready
for
action
doctrine
is
where
it
was
and
usage
and
precedence
and
principle
and
policy
there
may
be
changes
but
they
are
consolidations
or
adaptations
all
is
unequivocal
and
determinate
with
an
identity
which
there
is
no
disputing
indeed
it
is
one
of
the
most
popular
charges
against
the
catholic
church
at
this
very
time
that
she
is
incorrigible
change
she
can
not
if
we
listen
to
athanasius
or
leo
change
she
never
will
if
we
believe
the
controversialist
or
alarmist
of
the
present
day
such
were
the
thoughts
concerning
the
blessed
vision
of
peace
of
one
whose
petition
had
been
that
the
most
merciful
would
not
despise
the
work
of
his
own
hands
nor
leave
him
to
himself
while
yet
his
eyes
were
dim
and
his
breast
laden
and
he
could

reason
in

things
